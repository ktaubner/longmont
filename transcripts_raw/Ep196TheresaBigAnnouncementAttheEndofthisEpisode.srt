346
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:40,640
If

347
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:43,040
you do well enough

348
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:49,240
in the pool in the pool comma

349
00:25:49,240 --> 00:26:00,720
The pool. The end. The end. Is that the end of the Mad Lib? Well, well, comma the end of

350
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:06,920
the pool is six feet deep. Yeah. Okay. The deep end of the pool. Of the pool. Okay, is

351
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:13,080
there another, is there another one or is that the last one? That's the last one. Okay.

352
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:13,920
Hold on.

353
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:19,760
All right.

354
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:20,600
- Okay.

355
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:21,720
- What's this one called again?

356
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:22,880
- This one's called...

357
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:25,140
(laughing)

358
00:26:25,140 --> 00:26:28,840
This one's called Sage Advice.

359
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:30,160
- Okay.

360
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:33,240
- According to the pioneer of downhill swimming,

361
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:34,080
- Oh.

362
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:36,960
- Pamerican, when you ski,

363
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:39,540
your watery equipment should be the equal

364
00:26:39,540 --> 00:26:40,960
of your wet ability.

365
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:41,800
- Yeah.

366
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:46,640
sage advice when purchasing your first pair of swimmers. It is swimmingly

367
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:52,520
important to take many pools into consideration before plunking down fast

368
00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:58,960
bucks for your aquatic creatures. Your gender, your height, and your the Olympics

369
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:04,400
are all swimmer-like factors in selecting a pair of divers that match

370
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:10,560
your skills and gold and silver Olympic medals but not bronze. It goes without

371
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:14,320
without jumping into the pool. If you don't have the right skis, you're

372
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:19,900
starting off on the wrong pool that you swim in for the Olympics in summertime

373
00:27:19,900 --> 00:27:25,160
to win gold or silver Olympic medals. If you do well enough in the pool, the end

374
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:25,880
of the pool is

375
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:29,800
that's pretty good.

376
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:36,320
All right, I think I'm lived out yeah, I think I've gone completely mad yeah,

377
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:40,520

378
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:43,480
since mad libs is uh...

379
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:44,760

383
00:27:58,280 --> 00:28:02,800

in your area shining a red light on its own making a worse

393
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:35,040
the most well-spoken tattoo there

394
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:37,040
You're gonna get a tattoo on the scar?

395
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:39,040
Around the whole thing, yeah.

396
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:41,040
Why not just do the other elbow?

397
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:43,040
I guess I have to now.

398
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:45,040
The right elbow is cooler anyway.

399
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:47,040
Yeah, I guess.

400
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:49,040
But then I won't be able to use my arm for the rest of the day.

401
00:28:49,040 --> 00:28:51,040
That is a good point actually.

402
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:53,040
And it's not gonna be more than just a day.

403
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:55,040
You're gonna web your elbows like your first real tattoo?

404
00:28:55,040 --> 00:28:57,040
Yeah, that's pretty funny.

405
00:28:57,040 --> 00:28:59,040
That is so cool, dude.

406
00:28:59,040 --> 00:29:01,040
That is so fucking sick.

407
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:03,040
I was really drunk when I booked this.

408
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:04,040
- That's gonna be awesome. - When are you doing it?

409
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:05,040
- That's the sickest shit ever.

410
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:06,540
- I think I might go-- - In two days.

411
00:29:06,540 --> 00:29:07,840
- Two days? - Yeah.

412
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:08,840
- Dude, and getting-- - Nice.

413
00:29:08,840 --> 00:29:11,340
- At the one, I shouldn't say the address.

414
00:29:11,340 --> 00:29:12,180
(laughing)

415
00:29:12,180 --> 00:29:14,480
- Getting an arm tattoo as your first tattoo

416
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:16,140
is the coolest thing you can do, I think.

417
00:29:16,140 --> 00:29:17,320
- Yeah. - You did it.

418
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:18,560
- Yup. - I did it.

419
00:29:18,560 --> 00:29:19,400
- I did it. - Yup.

420
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:20,240
- You did it.

421
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:22,840
Yeah, you're about to do it.

422
00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:24,440
- I did it, I already did.

423
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:27,160
So I know exactly how much the pain--

424
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:28,320
- It's not about the pain, it's just about

425
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:30,920
looking like a complete psycho and like whatever.

426
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:36,200
This one this one is so stupid. That was crazy, because it's yeah, the only

427
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:41,200
visible one. Yeah, I walk around and and I haven't got another one in like a

428
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:44,840
year. Yep, yeah, I was bringing to college and everyone thought I was

429
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:49,080
normal and then I showed up with a dragon on my forearm one day. One giant

430
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:54,040
forearm tattoo is the sickest. Yeah, yeah, I was going to do that. No leg

431
00:29:54,040 --> 00:29:59,400
tattoos that are visible at all. Yeah, exactly. The giant for only for I was

432
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:05,360
gonna do that. I was gonna get a big forearm tattoo. Of what? Of a boar. Why are

433
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:09,280
you so obsessed with this boar? It's on my family crest and then I looked at my

434
00:30:09,280 --> 00:30:15,200
family crest and I was like that's not cool. It's not a cool looking boar. A family crest, I

435
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:18,580
don't think it matters what's cool or not. I think a family crest tattoo is

436
00:30:18,580 --> 00:30:22,120
inherently uncool. Yeah. Yeah I don't think it matters what's on the crest.

437
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:26,000
Tattoos are about disrespecting your parents and you're doing the

438
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:32,480
ultimate parent respect. Yeah, that's why I was like, "Well, what's the

439
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:38,120
complete opposite of a family crest tattoo? A giant spider web on your elbow."

440
00:30:38,120 --> 00:30:42,160
That's true. That's true. Because parents are scared of spiders.

441
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:47,920
Or Charlotte's Web. Yeah. Okay. Now I have to get a... I seriously just fucking owned you.

442
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:52,760
The parents in Charlotte's Web are evil. Who's Charlotte? Charlotte. What if I got a

443
00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:57,320
got a pig charlotte you can get a pig there i got a pig right here but i will

444
00:30:57,320 --> 00:31:01,040
tell you someone that we know has a pig tattoo right there and you're not gonna

445
00:31:01,040 --> 00:31:07,080
like who it is but i'll tell you when we're not recording

446
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:10,400
i think i'm gonna finish my tom and jerry tattoo soon yeah you gotta do that

447
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:13,240
i'm gonna do it next week yeah yeah maybe i'll get it

448
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:19,080
patrick inspired me two pigs you should get the angry birds pigs

449
00:31:19,080 --> 00:31:24,080
You should get the green pigs on one arm and then the birds on the other arm.

450
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:31,640
Dude, I'm so glad I waited until I was like at least 24 to get tattoos.

451
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:32,640
Why?

452
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:36,280
Because I would, dude, if I got tattoos when I was 18, that would have been so

453
00:31:36,280 --> 00:31:37,280
bad.

454
00:31:37,280 --> 00:31:38,280
Because of the pain?

455
00:31:38,280 --> 00:31:42,480
No, no, you shouldn't be able to get tattoos until you're like 21.

456
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:45,640
No, the whole point is that you pick something really stupid and you have to

457
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:46,640
live with it forever.

458
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:47,640
Yeah.

459
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:48,640
That's literally what it is.

460
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:52,120
I would have gotten the crooked skateboard eyes somewhere.

461
00:31:52,120 --> 00:31:55,280
It's locking yourself in as a stupid idiot.

462
00:31:55,280 --> 00:31:56,280
That would be cool.

463
00:31:56,280 --> 00:31:58,000
That would be honestly sick.

464
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:01,200
Get the Neversoft logo tattooed on the small of your back.

465
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:02,200
Damn.

466
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:07,560
I want to get the Bob Burnquist anti-hero logo tramp stamp.

467
00:32:07,560 --> 00:32:10,320
I might get McDonald's.

468
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:12,840
It's not that different from getting a McDonald's tattoo.

469
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:19,640
I know, I know so many of my good friends got skateboard tattoos when they were young and

470
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:22,560
it's like man, you got that logo on you forever.

471
00:32:22,560 --> 00:32:24,040
It's supposed to humble you.

472
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:25,040
Yeah, it's true.

473
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:26,040
If you get a really bad one.

474
00:32:26,040 --> 00:32:30,640
When you're 15, I know somebody has a, you know the game Dishonored?

475
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:32,640
Oh yeah, you've talked about that before.

476
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:35,640
They have the Dishonored logo on their hand.

477
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:37,200
That's their hand tat.

478
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:38,200
That's what you should be doing.

479
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:42,040
Dude, the fucking Neversoft logo on my palm.

480
00:32:42,040 --> 00:32:48,360
If somebody's tattoos are too cool, it's lame.

481
00:32:48,360 --> 00:32:50,040
They have to be bad.

482
00:32:50,040 --> 00:32:51,880
They have to be stupid.

483
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:55,600
I want to get maybe the Neversoft logo here.

484
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:56,840
You know what we should all get?

485
00:32:56,840 --> 00:32:58,800
We should get a mustache on this finger.

486
00:32:58,800 --> 00:33:00,600
That would be so tight.

487
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:03,080
We could all get different kinds of mustache.

488
00:33:03,080 --> 00:33:04,080
You could get like a-

489
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:05,080
I get a black squirter.

490
00:33:05,080 --> 00:33:06,080
Like a year's?

491
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:07,080
No, I get the Charlie Chaplin.

492
00:33:07,080 --> 00:33:08,080
Because I'm kind of a Charlie Chaplin-

493
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:09,080
Yeah, the Charlie Chaplin.

494
00:33:09,080 --> 00:33:10,080
I would say.

495
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:14,720
I've been watching a bunch of old like Japanese TV shows and

496
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:19,840
chaplainies yeah chaplainies and so many Japanese people in the in the like even

497
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:26,760
in the like fifties had the like Hitler mustache. Yeah, it's so Charlie

498
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:29,720
chaplain, Charlie chaplain. No, I'm talking about the Hitler mustache, the

499
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:32,360
different muscle. So you think the Charlie chaplain mustache on the Hitler

500
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:35,760
mustache or the same thing is what you just revealed just now because I was

501
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:38,360
thinking of something different. I was just talking about my fresh is the

502
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:40,400
Hitler one's evil, the Charlie Chaplin one is funny.

503
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:42,400
It's upside down.

504
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:44,400
The Hitler square is upside down.

505
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:46,400
I'm thinking about that like,

506
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:48,400
somebody gets the fucking mustache finger

507
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:50,400
tattoo in like 2012

508
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:52,400
but they can't afford to get it removed

509
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:54,400
so they get it blacked out.

510
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:58,400
It's a black finger.

511
00:33:58,400 --> 00:34:00,400
They have like a black

512
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:02,400
square on their leg.

513
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:04,400
Like that mustache finger,

514
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:06,400
it fucks you, like if you can't afford

515
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:11,360
get that removed and you want it gone, there's no way you can without it.

516
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:14,760
Tattoo removal also doesn't work all that well. It always looks so bad.

517
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:19,760
You know those pictures that people post that are like, if you see this haircut in your neighborhood,

518
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:23,120
your rent's going up and it's like the fucked up mullets and stuff? I think that if the

519
00:34:23,120 --> 00:34:27,720
Hitler mustache wasn't evil, that would be what that meme was. If you see this mustache

520
00:34:27,720 --> 00:34:30,760
in your neighborhood, the rent's going up. That would be a gentrifier mustache.

521
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:32,960
If Hitler hadn't done the whole thing.

522
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:34,240
He would be a hipster.

523
00:34:34,240 --> 00:34:35,880
He would be, yeah I mean.

524
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:40,800
Adolf and a lot of way yeah I mean that's that's pretty natural I feel like like

00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:44,320

526
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:48,200
creates be created bad art yep that's right yeah that artist and he got

00:34:48,200 --> 00:34:52,320

'Cause all of her songs are so weird.

I skipped one. I'll just replace it. Believe it or not, it was an ugly song

589
00:39:44,600 --> 00:39:50,200
that my mother used to sing me when it was time for human being and it never

00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:26,560
hot as any chick she's so ugly she looks like she came down from another planet

597
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:31,080
and she's not hot at all the awkward and asymmetrical facial features along with

598
00:40:31,080 --> 00:40:35,880
with her Yosemite Joe body should really be at the top of this list.

599
00:40:35,880 --> 00:40:41,980
Yosemite Joe, your Yosemite Joe body. I don't even if they I don't know what

606
00:41:14,020 --> 00:41:15,160
mean she makes a lot of

607
00:41:15,160 --> 00:41:17,940
women wet like water,

608
00:41:17,940 --> 00:41:19,700
water

609
00:41:19,700 --> 00:41:22,100

00:41:22,100 --> 00:41:27,500
I need to need some liquid. I'm nothing yeah. I need a liquid hold on yeah.

618
00:41:52,820 --> 00:41:56,420

619
00:41:56,420 --> 00:41:58,680
(laughter)

620
00:41:58,680 --> 00:42:01,220
- Wow.

621
00:42:01,220 --> 00:42:02,860
Yeah, who's number three?

622
00:42:02,860 --> 00:42:04,700
- Number three is Rihanna.

623
00:42:04,700 --> 00:42:06,080
- Rihanna, what? - What, dude?

624
00:42:06,080 --> 00:42:07,300
- The fuck is wrong with this list?

625
00:42:07,300 --> 00:42:08,820
- Rihanna is so beautiful.

626
00:42:08,820 --> 00:42:11,920
- This person says Rihanna is extremely ugly.

627
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:13,300
- That's insane.

628
00:42:13,300 --> 00:42:14,820
- The makeup hides the fact,

629
00:42:14,820 --> 00:42:16,880
but that makeup has to come off eventually.

630
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:19,340
She also gets nose fillers to give herself a nose bridge

631
00:42:19,340 --> 00:42:20,740
because without those, what?

632
00:42:20,740 --> 00:42:22,640
Plural what?

633
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:25,060
- Plural, um.

634
00:42:25,060 --> 00:42:27,060
She took-- Weave and wigs.

635
00:42:27,060 --> 00:42:29,220
Wigs won't work?

636
00:42:29,220 --> 00:42:31,220
Adjective. Adjective?

637
00:42:31,220 --> 00:42:35,220
Um, uh, that stupid Saudi who's fooling-- what?

638
00:42:35,220 --> 00:42:36,720
[laughter]

639
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:39,720
The stupid Saudi who's fooling Arthur Hassan Jamil

640
00:42:39,720 --> 00:42:41,720
needs to put his damn glasses back on

641
00:42:41,720 --> 00:42:43,720
and see that ugly Rihanna's real face?

642
00:42:43,720 --> 00:42:45,720
That's insane to say.

643
00:42:45,720 --> 00:42:47,720
Hit her with a shovel.

644
00:42:47,720 --> 00:42:49,720
[whispering]

645
00:42:49,720 --> 00:42:51,720
Hitting with a shovel. Hitting? Hitting her with a shovel

646
00:42:51,720 --> 00:42:53,720
and spitting on her face.

647
00:42:53,720 --> 00:42:57,040
is what it says here.

648
00:42:57,040 --> 00:43:03,720
It's a bit of an out bidding yeah. She poor thing looks like she has down

649
00:43:03,720 --> 00:43:04,240
syndrome.

650
00:43:04,240 --> 00:43:12,520
I'm reading it. I don't know what are you laughing about nothing nothing

651
00:43:12,520 --> 00:43:17,880
well anything else that you want us to read you're interested in knowing about

652
00:43:17,880 --> 00:43:20,620
Rihanna, because I can just check it here.

653
00:43:22,420 --> 00:43:25,820
No, but I actually have an interview with Rihanna that I found.

654
00:43:25,820 --> 00:43:26,820
Whoa, whoa.

655
00:43:26,820 --> 00:43:27,820
Are you for real?

656
00:43:27,820 --> 00:43:29,220
You're doing a lot of research for this.

657
00:43:29,220 --> 00:43:30,540
I'm pretty proud of Patrick.

658
00:43:30,540 --> 00:43:34,300
He's doing like actually, he's getting pretty involved in the list and stuff.

659
00:43:34,300 --> 00:43:36,940
This is something, it's a pretty long quote.

660
00:43:36,940 --> 00:43:37,940
What, where was this from?

661
00:43:37,940 --> 00:43:38,940
GQ or something?

662
00:43:38,940 --> 00:43:39,940
This is, yeah.

663
00:43:39,940 --> 00:43:40,940
Oh wow, okay.

664
00:43:40,940 --> 00:43:41,940
From her GQ interview.

665
00:43:41,940 --> 00:43:44,940
Okay, from her ML interview.

666
00:43:44,940 --> 00:43:45,940
Yeah.

667
00:43:45,940 --> 00:43:49,940
So this is a really long quote from Rihanna.

668
00:43:49,940 --> 00:43:54,820
said. Giraffes have aroused the curiosity of chicks since the earliest times. The

669
00:43:54,820 --> 00:43:59,700
giraffe is the tallest living tallest of all living planets but scientists are

670
00:43:59,700 --> 00:44:05,500
unable to explain how it got its long facial features. The giraffe's tremendous

671
00:44:05,500 --> 00:44:14,060
height which which might reach to Yosemite Joe's comes mostly from its legs

672
00:44:14,060 --> 00:44:21,340
and banana face. If a giraffe wants to take a drink of water from the ground it

673
00:44:21,340 --> 00:44:32,940
has to spread its... its bodies far apart in order to reach down and lap up the

674
00:44:32,940 --> 00:44:39,940
water with this huge ugly bodies. The giraffe has beautiful ears that are

675
00:44:39,940 --> 00:44:49,180

756
00:51:36,900 --> 00:51:40,900

771
00:52:42,280 --> 00:52:48,160
post. I found on a funny forum. I was about my it's it's yeah, but it's

772
00:52:48,160 --> 00:52:52,040
about it's about from a movie forum. Oh, that's from movies. It's movies

773

774
00:52:55,220 --> 00:52:59,420
mean, I was like me is the video movie awards yeah, we like to read funny

775
00:52:59,420 --> 00:53:02,000
yeah, of course. I mean that's the whole point of the fucking to read

776
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:06,300
funny things. Yeah, well here I found this on the Internet in recent years.

777
00:53:06,300 --> 00:53:09,940
There have been too many disaster movies in which tall pieces of turkey

778
00:53:09,980 --> 00:53:14,840
chicken catch on fire, raw dinosaurs come to life and huge ass cheeks attack

779
00:53:14,840 --> 00:53:18,380
people in the ocean, making you afraid to get out of your chicken piece in the

780
00:53:18,380 --> 00:53:21,500
morning. True movie fans ask why we can't have more

781
00:53:21,500 --> 00:53:24,820
one of the ass what a movie.

782
00:53:24,820 --> 00:53:29,000
We can't have more white pictures

783
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:31,040
like

784
00:53:31,040 --> 00:53:34,020
it's a wonderful ass

785
00:53:35,260 --> 00:53:40,740
on with the chocolate chip pancake or mr. Robin that goes to the on stage.

786
00:53:40,740 --> 00:53:48,440
These films made you feel slutty all over these same fans ask also ask why we

787
00:53:48,440 --> 00:53:52,360
can't have more funny films with comedians such as laurel and audience and

788
00:53:52,360 --> 00:53:53,460
Abbott and Pharrell.

789
00:53:53,460 --> 00:53:59,320
These hat wearing performers gave us great slapstick to have big hats that

790
00:53:59,320 --> 00:54:01,740
still makes our chicken pieces ache from laughing.

791
00:54:04,040 --> 00:54:20,960
do miss those white pictures like mr. Robin thick goes to the stage.

792
00:54:20,960 --> 00:54:27,880
You don't get pictures like that anymore. No, those white pictures.

793
00:54:27,880 --> 00:54:33,380
to the on stage. It's a wonderful ass. Yep. I'm so glad I went with hat wearer for

794
00:54:33,380 --> 00:54:41,520
Pharrell. That was so genius of me. Yeah. Wow. Well I mean. I mean that's just a, I

795
00:54:41,520 --> 00:54:45,040
feel like. I mean well we just yeah I mean a forum but we got a little off

796
00:54:45,040 --> 00:54:48,560
track from the list. Yeah. I mean should we just. Is it worth going back to the

797
00:54:48,560 --> 00:54:54,520
list or should we just do the first Mad Lib in a while. I feel like we could close it out with a Mad Lib. Yeah that makes sense.

798
00:54:54,520 --> 00:54:55,520
That does make sense.

799
00:54:55,520 --> 00:54:56,520
That does make sense.

800
00:54:56,520 --> 00:54:59,080
Because that's what we've been doing, so we might as well close it out with one.

801
00:54:59,080 --> 00:55:00,080
Yeah.

802
00:55:00,080 --> 00:55:01,920
Yeah, let's, alright, let's close it out with a Mad Lib.

803
00:55:01,920 --> 00:55:06,120
That'll be the end of the episode, and then next time we won't do any Mad Libs.

804
00:55:06,120 --> 00:55:08,960
We'll do no Mad Libs at all in the future.

805
00:55:08,960 --> 00:55:09,960
There will be no Mad Libs in the next episode.

806
00:55:09,960 --> 00:55:11,880
Unless we find another book in the trash.

807
00:55:11,880 --> 00:55:12,880
Then that's a promise we can keep.

808
00:55:12,880 --> 00:55:16,360
For whatever reason, but I'm pretty sure we won't do another, we won't, and I know this

809
00:55:16,360 --> 00:55:20,000
episode's been like only a quarter Mad Libs or something.

810
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:22,480
But still that might be a little too much for some people.

811
00:55:22,480 --> 00:55:26,520
so we'll just do next episode, no mad lives at all. Okay, we're not going to

812
00:55:26,520 --> 00:55:29,680
make the entire podcast only mad lives from it's not going to be a mad lives.

813
00:55:29,680 --> 00:55:32,400
It's not going to be podcast about lives. It's not going to become that

814
00:55:32,400 --> 00:55:33,240
really sad

815
00:55:33,240 --> 00:55:38,980
it won't be that no definitely an awful idea. Who would want to listen to a

816
00:55:38,980 --> 00:55:43,200
hour of people doing mad a one hour of people listening to mad lives because

817
00:55:43,200 --> 00:55:46,720
they found it in the trash on the way over. How is that entertaining in any

818
00:55:46,720 --> 00:55:51,360
that's not or it's not people want to it's way more important to read a list

819
00:55:51,380 --> 00:55:58,560
Exactly to say a bunch of celebrity names people want to hear us come up with new funny ideas and not just read mad libs

820
00:55:58,560 --> 00:55:59,980
Yeah, I mean yeah

821
00:55:59,980 --> 00:56:05,100
Some people might argue that mad libs are coming up with the whole thing of mad libs is coming up with funny ideas

822
00:56:05,100 --> 00:56:08,200
But they're wrong because it's not an engaging thing for a podcast

823
00:56:08,200 --> 00:56:12,240
Can one of you fuckers just give me a fucking adjective?

824
00:56:12,240 --> 00:56:15,540
fucking fucking

825
00:56:15,540 --> 00:56:18,940
Okay, I think I have a direction in my head for this one. Yeah, all right now

826
00:56:18,940 --> 00:56:21,900
Yeah, can someone just give me a person in the room that is not Caleb and says

827
00:56:21,900 --> 00:56:22,420
Mr. Fuck.

828
00:56:22,420 --> 00:56:23,420
Mr. Fuck.

829
00:56:23,420 --> 00:56:30,140
Can someone give me a noun, please?

830
00:56:30,140 --> 00:56:30,640
Fucker.

831
00:56:30,640 --> 00:56:31,140
Fucker.

832
00:56:31,140 --> 00:56:31,640
Fucker.

833
00:56:31,640 --> 00:56:32,640
Fucker, all right.

834
00:56:32,640 --> 00:56:34,340
Hey, I like it.
