00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,640
*outro music*

2
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:11,300
belong to us.

3
00:00:11,300 --> 00:00:13,300
It's so hard to do a clap.

4
00:00:13,300 --> 00:00:17,300
All of your base

5
00:00:17,300 --> 00:00:19,300
are belong...

6
00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:21,300
Wait, wait, wait, do the clap.

7
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:23,300
All of your base

8
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:27,300
are belong to us

9
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:31,300
when the long cat is...

10
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:33,300
When the power level is over 9000.

11
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:37,300
When the long cat is over 9000.

12
00:00:37,300 --> 00:00:39,300
The sun pad is long.

13
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:41,300
There is nothing in this song.

14
00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:45,300
We are feeling so casual because of our environment right now.

15
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:47,300
Look at how casual we are.

16
00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:49,300
Normally, here's what every day is for us.

17
00:00:49,300 --> 00:00:51,300
We wake up.

18
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:53,300
Oh shit, oh fuck I'm late.

19
00:00:53,300 --> 00:00:55,300
I go, I hit the alarm clock.

20
00:00:55,300 --> 00:00:57,300
I smash it into pieces.

21
00:00:57,300 --> 00:00:59,300
And then I fall back asleep.

22
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:01,300
My dog wakes me up by licking me in the face.

23
00:01:01,300 --> 00:01:03,300
And then I go, fuck I'm late to work.

24
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:05,300
I go into our office.

25
00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:12,700
this. See, once we started going into an office for it, I think that the chill ass vibes that

26
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:16,740
we had... It just feels like a job, bro. Yeah. It feels like a job. It's time to kick back.

27
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:22,020
Now we're doing what we used to do. We used to sit in a line on a couch and look straight

28
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:29,340
ahead at the TV. And we would watch TV most of the episode. We would usually, we had on

29
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:34,420
Pluto TV, some family guy or some fail army or something. Pluto TV, Bar Rescue. We're watching

30
00:01:34,420 --> 00:01:35,420
it right now.

31
00:01:35,420 --> 00:01:38,420
So put on.

32
00:01:38,420 --> 00:01:39,620
No, don't put on.

33
00:01:39,620 --> 00:01:41,460
Man, I don't know.

34
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:43,020
Not that bad. Not a bad idea.

35
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:45,180
But anyway, you're just burped

36
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:46,100
is stinky.

37
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:47,460
That is maybe.

38
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:50,780
I that smelled exactly like

39
00:01:50,780 --> 00:01:52,060
Dinty Moore beef stew.

40
00:01:52,060 --> 00:01:54,940
Yeah, it smelled almost it was like

41
00:01:54,940 --> 00:01:56,980
if you were telling somebody to

42
00:01:56,980 --> 00:01:58,140
replicate a scent.

43
00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:00,180
I think that they would.

44
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:01,720
What was it? What did you tell people

45
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:03,220
that often? What did I eat for dinner

46
00:02:03,220 --> 00:02:04,220
last night? I had carne asada.

47
00:02:04,220 --> 00:02:06,680
No. What did you eat that before this?

48
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:10,460
I had some leftover rice for my carne asada meal,

49
00:02:10,460 --> 00:02:12,220
and I had some chorizo and some eggs.

50
00:02:12,220 --> 00:02:15,760
OK, so I guess that combined with grapefrost C4

51
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:19,160
creates a perfect beef stew scent

52
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:22,840
that I don't even know.

53
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:27,800
I can't even you putting this on the TV is genuinely so bad for me.

54
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:29,400
Yeah, you're you're trying to kill.

55
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:32,140
I I can't do this.

56
00:02:32,140 --> 00:02:34,140
This guy just fell off of a stove.

57
00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:35,140
Wait, no, just describe the stuff.

58
00:02:35,140 --> 00:02:37,140
Okay, this lady's riding on a hoverboard.

59
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:38,140
Okay.

60
00:02:38,140 --> 00:02:39,140
Oh, she's going to fall.

61
00:02:39,140 --> 00:02:40,140
She looks like she's having a seizure.

62
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:41,140
Oh!

63
00:02:41,140 --> 00:02:44,140
She's fallen and hit her head so hard her glasses flew off.

64
00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:51,140
Imagine if you, if you like ended up on Fail Army in front of, like, failing in front of your children.

65
00:02:51,140 --> 00:02:54,140
Do you think that like, they would look at you?

66
00:02:54,140 --> 00:02:55,140
What was the...

67
00:02:55,140 --> 00:02:56,140
I'm trying to get out.

68
00:02:56,140 --> 00:02:57,140
You can't, we can't.

69
00:02:57,140 --> 00:02:59,140
You gotta shut it off, man.

70
00:02:59,140 --> 00:03:00,140
It's way too funny.

71
00:03:00,140 --> 00:03:01,140
You can't do that to me.

72
00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:03,140
Did you guys ever see your parents fail?

73
00:03:03,140 --> 00:03:03,640
Yeah.

74
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:04,140
Yeah.

75
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:07,640
One time, I think my sister talks about this a lot.

76
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:17,140
It was like the day, she says, she cites it as the day she realized my dad was not, uh, not, what's the word?

77
00:03:17,140 --> 00:03:17,640
God?

78
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:22,140
Yeah, that my dad was not like, uh, a moral person.

79
00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:24,140
A moral person.

80
00:03:24,140 --> 00:03:25,140
She found your dad a bad guy?

81
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:28,140
No, my dad, my dad just, uh, my dad ran a red light by accident.

82
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:29,140
That is immoral.

83
00:03:29,140 --> 00:03:31,540
And he just went like, "Oh, my bad."

84
00:03:31,540 --> 00:03:33,100
And she was young.

85
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:36,540
So it's like when you're young and you learn about the laws and shit,

86
00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:39,940
and you're like, "Oh my God, he's going to get in trouble."

87
00:03:39,940 --> 00:03:40,540
A traffic thing.

88
00:03:40,540 --> 00:03:43,620
When I was young, I'd always think about this and I would always tell my parents

89
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:47,580
this, that if I was in a car chase and I was trying to flee, I was trying to get

90
00:03:47,580 --> 00:03:50,820
away from the police, I would just signal a left turn and take a right or vice versa.

91
00:03:50,820 --> 00:03:51,500
Whoa.

92
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:51,940
True.

93
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:53,900
Because they're behind you, they signal left now.

94
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:54,300
Yeah.

95
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:56,660
And they can't break the law.

96
00:03:56,660 --> 00:03:57,140
Yeah.

97
00:03:57,140 --> 00:03:58,780
So they have to commit to that left turn.

98
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:02,340
But I had that idea around first or second grade and I've held on to it. I

99
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:07,260
remember telling my teacher, because my dad used to drive, he drove all day

100
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:11,060
between like job sites because he's doing construction and he would always

101
00:04:11,060 --> 00:04:17,500
drive while reading a John Grisham novel. He would read and drive and I

102
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:20,780
thought it was like a cool trick and he would drive with one knee. He would

103
00:04:20,780 --> 00:04:26,300
have no hands on the wheel, driving with one knee and reading a book. And I

104
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:29,300
told my teacher that it was my dad's special talent.

105
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:31,300
And she said that's illegal.

106
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:33,300
Shut up, bitch!

107
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:35,300
My buddy in high school,

108
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:39,300
we would go back to his house

109
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:41,300
before we'd go skate,

110
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:44,300
but this kid would always drive with his knees

111
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:46,300
and text while he was driving.

112
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:48,300
I miss texting and driving.

113
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:51,300
He would be driving his mom's minivan

114
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:55,300
and just fully on Snapchat

115
00:04:55,300 --> 00:05:03,340
chat talking to some girl or something and I was such a nerd that I was like, "Maybe

116
00:05:03,340 --> 00:05:09,100
watch the road. He's doing the coolest thing you can do as a 16 year old." And I was like,

117
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:10,100
"Okay, well..."

118
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:12,700
Well, there's nothing nerdy about not wanting to die.

119
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:13,700
Facts.

120
00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:16,700
I think that that is probably the nerdiest thing you can do.

121
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:18,220
If you want to die, you are a cool jock.

122
00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:19,220
Things are changing in today's world.

123
00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:22,380
Cool jocks want to die, that's why you play football. Modern day gladiators.

124
00:05:22,380 --> 00:05:25,580
Hey, can I tell you something? Cool jocks nowadays like anime.

125
00:05:25,580 --> 00:05:28,380
Yeah. I learned this from watching nerds.

126
00:05:28,380 --> 00:05:31,680
Nerds like to lift weights. I watched 21 Jump Street.

127
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:34,980
Yeah. And I learned that nowadays it's cool to be gay.

128
00:05:34,980 --> 00:05:38,180
Yep. It's cool to be sensitive now. Yeah. According to

129
00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:42,180
21 Jump Street and Dave Franco who's in it. And then in 22 Jump Street

130
00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:43,580
they said, "Well, never mind."

131
00:05:43,580 --> 00:05:46,380
Yeah. They said never mind. Actually all along we were lying. Jocks are back.

132
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:49,380
I didn't, I don't think I saw 22 Jump Street. Do they go to middle school?

133
00:05:49,380 --> 00:05:51,180
They go to college.

134
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:52,460
That's a good idea.

135
00:05:52,460 --> 00:05:53,760
I would have gone the other way.

136
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:54,760
Go backwards.

137
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:56,020
Why would you go to college?

138
00:05:56,020 --> 00:05:58,760
So they can play that needle drop, Asher Roth.

139
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:00,900
That party last night.

140
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:02,440
And then it goes to middle school.

141
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:04,440
So it's them walking into a party.

142
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:05,400
It did me too.

143
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:07,940
And I was like, damn, college is going to be amazing.

144
00:06:07,940 --> 00:06:11,520
I was thinking the other day about how old I used to think people in college were.

145
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:12,200
Yeah.

146
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:15,900
And how I was like, that's really when your life starts.

147
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:17,740
When you're a kid, you're like, college is the one.

148
00:06:17,740 --> 00:06:20,740
Fourth graders were teenagers back when I was in fifth grade.

149
00:06:20,740 --> 00:06:23,740
When I was one, I thought two-year-olds were double my age.

150
00:06:23,740 --> 00:06:25,740
[Laughs]

151
00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:27,740
I was like, "That's crazy."

152
00:06:27,740 --> 00:06:29,740
I thought my grandma was old.

153
00:06:29,740 --> 00:06:31,740
My grandma is as old as dirt.

154
00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:33,740
But back when I was a kid, she was like 17.

155
00:06:33,740 --> 00:06:36,740
I did think, I think I saw someone in my neighborhood,

156
00:06:36,740 --> 00:06:39,740
I saw a 16-year-old smoke when I was younger,

157
00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:41,740
and I was like, "Damn."

158
00:06:41,740 --> 00:06:43,740
Didn't you start smoking when you were 12?

159
00:06:43,740 --> 00:06:44,740
Maybe that's why.

160
00:06:44,740 --> 00:06:46,740
Because you saw a 16-year-old.

161
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:49,780
cigarettes were nasty. There's a girl named Joey.

162
00:06:49,780 --> 00:06:55,140
OK, that is you have destined your kid to a cigarette heaven.

163
00:06:55,140 --> 00:06:58,740
If you name and she was the first person I ever saw to wear Jenko's.

164
00:06:58,740 --> 00:07:02,680
Joey, Joey, Jenko, Joey, Jenko, walk around smoking cigarettes.

165
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:04,620
Yeah. Was she beautiful?

166
00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:05,980
I don't remember that well.

167
00:07:05,980 --> 00:07:09,680
I just remember I just remember thinking, damn, those pants are huge.

168
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:11,380
She was a beauty queen. Probably.

169
00:07:11,380 --> 00:07:13,980
I mean, she was smoking at 16.

170
00:07:13,980 --> 00:07:14,820
You just said she was.

171
00:07:14,820 --> 00:07:15,820
Wait, what?

172
00:07:15,820 --> 00:07:16,820
What?

173
00:07:16,820 --> 00:07:17,820
He just said, I said, 16 year old smoking cigarettes.

174
00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:18,820
Oh yeah, she was smoking at 16.

175
00:07:18,820 --> 00:07:19,820
She was smoking at 16.

176
00:07:19,820 --> 00:07:20,820
She was smoking at 16.

177
00:07:20,820 --> 00:07:21,820
She was smoking at 16.

178
00:07:21,820 --> 00:07:22,820
She was smoking at 16.

179
00:07:22,820 --> 00:07:23,820
She was smoking at 16.

180
00:07:23,820 --> 00:07:24,820
She was smoking at 16.

181
00:07:24,820 --> 00:07:25,820
She was smoking at 16.

182
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:26,820
She was smoking at 16.

183
00:07:26,820 --> 00:07:27,820
She was smoking at 16.

184
00:07:27,820 --> 00:07:28,820
She was smoking at 16.

185
00:07:28,820 --> 00:07:29,820
She was smoking at 16.

186
00:07:29,820 --> 00:07:30,820
She was smoking at 16.

187
00:07:30,820 --> 00:07:31,820
She was smoking at 16.

188
00:07:31,820 --> 00:07:32,820
She was smoking at 16.

189
00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:33,820
She was smoking at 16.

190
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:34,820
She was smoking at 16.

191
00:07:34,820 --> 00:07:35,820
She was smoking at 16.

192
00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:36,820
She was smoking at 16.

193
00:07:36,820 --> 00:07:37,820
She was smoking at 16.

194
00:07:37,820 --> 00:07:38,820
She was smoking at 16.

195
00:07:38,820 --> 00:07:39,820
She was smoking at 16.

196
00:07:39,820 --> 00:07:40,820
She was smoking at 16.

197
00:07:40,820 --> 00:07:41,820
She was smoking at 16.

198
00:07:41,820 --> 00:07:45,220
We already accepted it. We're on the couch. This is casual.

199
00:07:45,220 --> 00:07:49,720
Uh-uh. I said she was smokey. Whoa. That changed the whole vibe up.

200
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:51,420
Yeah, I just realized it was really dark in here.

201
00:07:51,420 --> 00:07:53,820
It was really dark. I was feeling like I was in a bit of a swamp.

202
00:07:53,820 --> 00:07:55,020
Do you guys like this painting?

203
00:07:55,020 --> 00:07:57,820
This is called "Good Old Days" by Paul Dauter.

204
00:07:57,820 --> 00:07:59,020
Really?

205
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:00,020
Paul Dauter?

206
00:08:00,020 --> 00:08:00,820
I didn't even know that.

207
00:08:00,820 --> 00:08:02,420
That's like a Joey kind of name.

208
00:08:02,420 --> 00:08:03,820
No, Paul Dauferson.

209
00:08:03,820 --> 00:08:05,820
Oh, okay. Not as good as it.

210
00:08:05,820 --> 00:08:06,820
I can't read that.

211
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:09,520
I'm actually thinking this morning when I woke up,

212
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:12,720
Paul Detto and then they scratched out his name.

213
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:17,920
I want to jump into this painting like a Mario game and go hang out with those guys.

214
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:22,920
This is the good old days but where the hell is this?

215
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:23,920
I want to jump in it.

216
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:27,720
You know those paintings that they have of all that Roman food?

217
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:28,720
No.

218
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:33,240
You know those old Italian paintings of like, "Oh there's these grapes and there's these

219
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:34,240
bread."

220
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:35,240
I don't know.

221
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:39,320
and different cheeses that we don't have anymore that we've lost the recipe for.

222
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:43,160
Stop fidgeting with your microphone. No. I want to jump. It makes loud noises.

223
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:46,080
I want to jump into one of those so badly. They look so delicious.

224
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:49,480
If they saw like a bald person back then I think they would

225
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:53,240
they would probably. They had plenty of bald people. Socrates was bald.

226
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:57,840
Yep. Did he shave his head? Yeah, every day. More people were bald back in the day

227
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:58,920
than ever before.

228
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:03,400
Yeah. I thought they just let that shit hang like Benjamin Franklin did.

229
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:06,900
Benjamin Franklin is one of the ugliest people I've ever seen.

230
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:08,500
And he got hella pussy.

231
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:09,200
He did.

232
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:09,700
Mm-hmm.

233
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:11,300
Benjamin Franklin is literally...

234
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:14,900
You realize he was an author, inventor, scientist, politician, philosopher...

235
00:09:14,900 --> 00:09:17,600
And he got so much pussy, but he was ugly as fuck.

236
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,300
Same with Washington.

237
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:20,400
Every single person...

238
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:21,400
I don't think Washington was playing that down.

239
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:24,100
Every single person up until...

240
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:26,500
I mean, even JFK, he was ugly.

241
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:28,700
Every president has been ugly until maybe...

242
00:09:28,700 --> 00:09:32,100
Here's how you know that people used to be way uglier than they are now.

243
00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:35,540
People used to, when a woman was really good looking, they used to call her handsome.

244
00:09:35,540 --> 00:09:37,420
Yeah. That's how you know.

245
00:09:37,420 --> 00:09:40,020
Because they all looked like men.

246
00:09:40,020 --> 00:09:42,980
Yeah. They had big square faces.

247
00:09:42,980 --> 00:09:45,500
They used to call women handsome.

248
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:51,700
Yep. Yeah. Now, now women are saying now all women are saying is hand me some

249
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:53,420
credit cards so I can go shopping.

250
00:09:53,420 --> 00:09:56,540
Yeah. Hand some credit cards over.

251
00:09:56,540 --> 00:09:58,420
Hand me some hand sanitizer.

252
00:09:58,420 --> 00:09:59,580
Yeah. Hand sanitizer.

253
00:09:59,580 --> 00:10:00,580
Current pandemic.

254
00:10:00,580 --> 00:10:01,660
Wow. We're out of that.

255
00:10:01,660 --> 00:10:04,760
Yeah, it's been over. It's been over. No, we're still in a damn pandemic.

256
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:09,860
Y'all know it's over. Think about it. Okay, think about it. What do you want

257
00:10:09,860 --> 00:10:13,060
me to think about? What part of it? Think about how sick everyone is

258
00:10:13,060 --> 00:10:17,660
getting. I haven't. No. Oh, you just broke the paint. I didn't break it.

259
00:10:17,660 --> 00:10:20,460
I almost did, though. If you could jump into any painting in the world,

260
00:10:20,460 --> 00:10:22,860
what would you jump into? I was thinking about this when you're

261
00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:26,060
talking about that. Rothko. Yeah, I was going to say the funny answer.

262
00:10:26,060 --> 00:10:29,760
The obvious funny answer is to say like Rothko or Pollock or something

263
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:33,460
like that. I don't want funny. But those are funny, right? Those are the those are

264
00:10:33,460 --> 00:10:36,760
kind of the that's what a class clown would say instantly without giving any

265
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:38,560
thought to the deeper meaning of our shit.

266
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:41,160
That's right. So my answer.

267
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:42,460
Some of that real shit.

268
00:10:42,460 --> 00:10:46,760
Shoot, shoot. I want to be a clown of the podcast and Cameron one most likely to

269
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:49,260
become president. That's that's reverse shoe.

270
00:10:49,260 --> 00:10:50,760
Caleb. What's reverse? What?

271
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:52,960
Caleb, you were gone for that, weren't you?

272
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:53,860
Oh, yeah. He doesn't know.

273
00:10:53,860 --> 00:10:54,760
Shoot. You don't know about shoe.

274
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:55,560
Just don't tell him.

275
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:57,160
Shoe is the opposite of cap.

276
00:10:57,160 --> 00:10:58,760
So when you're telling the truth, you're shoeing.

277
00:10:59,260 --> 00:11:02,340
That makes sense. Yeah. Well, reverse shoe is that cap? That's lie.

278
00:11:02,340 --> 00:11:04,780
OK, so you don't think Cameron would win most likely?

279
00:11:04,780 --> 00:11:07,980
So what did you say? He said he was a class clown of the podcast.

280
00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:09,660
Cameron just said that I won.

281
00:11:09,660 --> 00:11:10,940
Cameron just said that I was class.

282
00:11:10,940 --> 00:11:12,340
I'd say you win anything.

283
00:11:12,340 --> 00:11:14,540
Cameron just said I was class clown.

284
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:16,980
I said you I said that's something a class clown would say.

285
00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:18,300
I didn't say you won class clown.

286
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:19,180
You said I won class.

287
00:11:19,180 --> 00:11:20,540
We don't have superlatives yet.

288
00:11:20,540 --> 00:11:21,900
I won. I won next world

289
00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:24,820
fairle. We should do them every four years, though.

290
00:11:24,820 --> 00:11:28,620
It is we are doing four years.

291
00:11:28,620 --> 00:11:30,300
It is four years of the podcast this year.

292
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:31,100
It's been five years.

293
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:31,600
Five years?

294
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:32,700
It will be five.

295
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:33,700
Well, the first year is a fluke.

296
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:34,560
We're coming up on five.

297
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:35,540
What do you mean it's a fluke?

298
00:11:35,540 --> 00:11:36,260
The first year...

299
00:11:36,260 --> 00:11:36,940
No, I'm with you on that.

300
00:11:36,940 --> 00:11:38,740
The first year I wasn't on the show.

301
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:40,540
OK, so let's do the superlatives then.

302
00:11:40,540 --> 00:11:41,040
OK.

303
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:41,540
Yeah.

304
00:11:41,540 --> 00:11:42,040
This is this.

305
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:43,440
We're doing superlatives now.

306
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:45,340
Maybe we make like a Google Forms.

307
00:11:45,340 --> 00:11:45,840
What?

308
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:46,340
Well, no.

309
00:11:46,340 --> 00:11:47,580
And then we have the fans vote.

310
00:11:47,580 --> 00:11:48,080
Well, no.

311
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:48,680
Fuck the fans.

312
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:49,180
No.

313
00:11:49,180 --> 00:11:52,180
Do the fans vote for the kids in the high school?

314
00:11:52,180 --> 00:11:52,680
What do you mean?

315
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:54,660
No, the other kids do.

316
00:11:54,660 --> 00:11:56,260
So let's...

317
00:11:56,260 --> 00:11:59,840
No, you have all the fans of the high school kids.

318
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:00,940
Vote for this.

319
00:12:00,940 --> 00:12:07,300
It doesn't make any sense that

320
00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:10,660
no, we've got each other.

321
00:12:10,660 --> 00:12:14,180
They tried that at they tried that at a high school and it was just like too

322
00:12:14,180 --> 00:12:15,500
many too many.

323
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:19,180
They were noticing traffic from one one neighborhood.

324
00:12:19,180 --> 00:12:24,040
What? OK, so now you and me vote for what Patrick is.

325
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:25,300
Oh, isn't it?

326
00:12:25,300 --> 00:12:26,000
Most likely.

327
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:26,500
Okay, sure.

328
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:29,200
Most likely to...

329
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:34,000
Just to maybe influence your answer a little bit.

330
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:34,500
Go.

331
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:38,900
Next Will Ferrell, class of 2015, Londonderry High School.

332
00:12:38,900 --> 00:12:40,600
You got next Will Ferrell?

333
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:46,500
Yeah, and then two years before it was next Tosh.0, so I thought that I was going to get next Tosh.0.

334
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:48,300
Okay.

335
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:51,300
You could be next...

336
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:53,500
Will Smith.

337
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:55,100
I'm going to slap you.

338
00:12:55,100 --> 00:12:56,260
No.

339
00:12:56,260 --> 00:12:56,760
What?

340
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:57,260
No.

341
00:12:57,260 --> 00:12:59,140
Next.

342
00:12:59,140 --> 00:13:01,100
It should be.

343
00:13:01,100 --> 00:13:04,420
He's already got Will Ferrell and he's already gotten Tosh.

344
00:13:04,420 --> 00:13:05,940
Then no, no.

345
00:13:05,940 --> 00:13:06,440
Comedian.

346
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:08,580
My friend's brother got next Daniel.

347
00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:09,540
No, next Tosh.

348
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:10,700
No, not Daniel Tosh.

349
00:13:10,700 --> 00:13:11,740
Next Tosh.

350
00:13:11,740 --> 00:13:12,240
Point.

351
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:13,460
Next show Tosh.

352
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:13,960
Point.

353
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:15,620
Most likely to be Tosh.

354
00:13:15,620 --> 00:13:16,120
Point.

355
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:16,620
Simpson.

356
00:13:16,620 --> 00:13:19,500
That you look like a Simpson.

357
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:23,420
And it's not just the couch talking and this is shoe.

358
00:13:23,740 --> 00:13:26,740
you look like my God, we need to do a couch gag.

359
00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:28,340
Yeah, that's what this is.

360
00:13:28,340 --> 00:13:29,440
Pause it right now.

361
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:30,940
Pause it right now.

362
00:13:30,940 --> 00:13:32,740
We're going to record ourselves doing a couch.

363
00:13:32,740 --> 00:13:33,840
Couch gag for us.

364
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:35,040
That will be the cold open.

365
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:35,440
Yeah.

366
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:35,840
Yeah.

367
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:38,740
I mean, it's got to be us scrambling onto the couch and

368
00:13:38,740 --> 00:13:40,440
then sitting down and turning on the TV.

369
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:46,140
We should do it.

370
00:13:46,140 --> 00:13:53,240
After this, can we do an exact one-to-one recreation of the

371
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:56,240
The Simpsons themes. Yeah, we have to sing it.

372
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:59,840
That acapella act, that acapella app.

373
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:02,040
We could do the whole thing.

374
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:04,140
Yeah, somebody's at.

375
00:14:04,140 --> 00:14:05,340
Jubio could be.

376
00:14:05,340 --> 00:14:06,940
Jubio is Maggie.

377
00:14:06,940 --> 00:14:08,240
Jubio could be Maggie.

378
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:09,840
Jubio is definitely Maggie.

379
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:12,240
Doesn't speak English, just like Maggie.

380
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:17,640
And who's, I think Cameron's maybe Marge.

381
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:18,340
I agree.

382
00:14:18,340 --> 00:14:18,940
Cameron is Marge.

383
00:14:18,940 --> 00:14:19,640
Cameron is Marge.

384
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:21,540
Because I have to get groceries after this anyway.

385
00:14:21,540 --> 00:14:24,120
You're a Homer and I'm a combination of Bart and Lisa.

386
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:25,120
Yeah.

387
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:26,120
Patrick's Bart, what are you talking about?

388
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:27,120
I'm a combination of Bart and Lisa.

389
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:28,120
Shut up.

390
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:29,120
I'm Bart.

391
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:30,120
You're the skateboard.

392
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:31,120
Man, you skateboard in the theme song.

393
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:32,120
I'm Bart.

394
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:33,120
You're Bart.

395
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:34,120
Well, I'm a combination of...

396
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:35,120
You can't skateboard in the theme song.

397
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:36,120
Okay.

398
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:37,120
I'm a combination of Bart and Homer.

399
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:38,120
No, man.

400
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:39,120
And...

401
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:40,120
And you're the music teacher.

402
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:41,120
What, you're going to strangle yourself?

403
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:42,120
You're the music teacher who tells Lisa to leave the room.

404
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:43,120
Yeah.

405
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:44,120
No, I'm not.

406
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:45,120
Yeah, you are.

407
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:46,120
Yeah, you are.

408
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:47,120
If I grew my hair out, I would.

409
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:48,120
You're Dr. Nelson Hibbert.

410
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:51,720
that one. Thank you. Yeah, but you don't get to be in the couch gag then. That's fine. As

411
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:57,800
long as I'm black off screen somewhere. It's fine by me. Your season one, episode two,

412
00:14:57,800 --> 00:15:05,440
Waylon Smithers. Why that one? They made him have purple hair. He had purple hair? And

413
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:09,080
black skin. He looked different? Smithers looked different? For one episode. I don't

414
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:12,840
remember that. They did all that type of thing. Yeah. They made mistakes. You know who I hate?

415
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:17,780
became blonde. I hate those white twins. Oh, they're not white. I think they're

416
00:15:17,780 --> 00:15:21,900
supposed to be Asian. No, they're not. No, they're not. They're white. I think

417
00:15:21,900 --> 00:15:26,940
they're Asian, but they are the color white in the show. Am I just being

418
00:15:26,940 --> 00:15:32,340
racist? Why? Because they're twins. You think they're Asian? No. What do you

419
00:15:32,340 --> 00:15:36,740
mean? What? What about them? Well, there's a way that their eyes are drawn.

420
00:15:36,740 --> 00:15:42,380
What? I don't know. The weird little white twins. Not that. Not the sisters.

421
00:15:42,380 --> 00:15:47,580
I okay. Is it crazy of me to think that they are supposed to they are like Asian

422
00:15:47,580 --> 00:15:48,980
coding not the sisters.

423
00:15:48,980 --> 00:15:51,080
Wait, maybe I'm not thinking of a twin.

424
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:52,580
Who are you thinking of?

425
00:15:52,580 --> 00:15:53,280
Who have the long?

426
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:54,080
Who's the white?

427
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:56,180
Who's the white kid with the curly hair?

428
00:15:56,180 --> 00:15:57,280
That's not a twin.

429
00:15:57,280 --> 00:16:00,280
That's a one of that's a one of Wendell.

430
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:00,880
Well, we don't know.

431
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:01,480
He's not a twin.

432
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:02,780
What if we have that one?

433
00:16:02,780 --> 00:16:05,780
What's he has some kind of name attached to him?

434
00:16:05,780 --> 00:16:07,780
Are you thinking of Martin Prince?

435
00:16:07,780 --> 00:16:09,080
No, no, Martin.

436
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:09,380
Martin.

437
00:16:09,380 --> 00:16:10,880
Everybody knows Martin.

438
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:12,180
Yeah, but you're still stupid.

439
00:16:12,180 --> 00:16:14,640
You thought that white kid is a normal white kid.

440
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:15,420
No, you're right.

441
00:16:15,420 --> 00:16:17,140
The twins are Asian.

442
00:16:17,140 --> 00:16:18,480
They got to be. Yeah, I know.

443
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:20,340
But they're not white, I don't think.

444
00:16:20,340 --> 00:16:21,720
Or are there? I don't know.

445
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:22,640
Oh, no, no, no, no.

446
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:23,340
They're not Asian.

447
00:16:23,340 --> 00:16:24,820
They're Marge's sisters.

448
00:16:24,820 --> 00:16:26,920
No, no, that's different twins.

449
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:29,480
You think of Patty and Selma?

450
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:29,920
Yeah.

451
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:33,640
I'm looking up Simpsons, Asian twins.

452
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:37,380
See, OK. Yeah, they actually are the twins.

453
00:16:37,380 --> 00:16:39,180
OK, OK.

454
00:16:39,180 --> 00:16:41,680
Are the twins really want to know if they're not an Asian?

455
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:45,820
but I don't think they are. Yeah. So and I'm standing fast.

456
00:16:45,820 --> 00:16:49,880
Okay, all right. So they're going to read that first post you found from Vin Diesel

457
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:51,320
to Vin Diesel to

458
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:57,720
so Wolfenstein 38 asked, well, I forgot their names because Caucasian people in

459
00:16:57,720 --> 00:17:00,880
the Simpsons are yellow and brown and black people are brown and Asian people

460
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:05,980
are white and are the twins. Are they white? So are anyway, are they Asian Vin

461
00:17:05,980 --> 00:17:10,020
Diesel to says, I don't think so dot dot dot their eyes are normal.

462
00:17:10,020 --> 00:17:12,940
M: That's Vin Diesel.

463
00:17:12,940 --> 00:17:16,100
M: Vin Diesel said that on NeoSeeker.com.

464
00:17:16,100 --> 00:17:17,700
M: That's fucking crazy.

465
00:17:17,700 --> 00:17:20,260
M: Oh their names are Sherry and Terry.

466
00:17:20,260 --> 00:17:21,260
M: Woah!

467
00:17:21,260 --> 00:17:22,260
M: Like SNL!

468
00:17:22,260 --> 00:17:23,260
M: Like SNL!

469
00:17:23,260 --> 00:17:24,260
M: Oh my god.

470
00:17:24,260 --> 00:17:25,260
M: Oh my god.

471
00:17:25,260 --> 00:17:26,260
M: Yeah.

472
00:17:26,260 --> 00:17:27,260
M: Yeah.

473
00:17:27,260 --> 00:17:28,260
M: Probably a comedy reference.

474
00:17:28,260 --> 00:17:29,260
M: Probably a comedy reference.

475
00:17:29,260 --> 00:17:30,260
M: It is probably a comedy reference.

476
00:17:30,260 --> 00:17:33,780
M: I saw a video the other day, it was 3 and a half hours long.

477
00:17:33,780 --> 00:17:37,860
M: I want to apologize for being racist about a Simpson.

478
00:17:37,860 --> 00:17:39,540
M: You were right about them though.

479
00:17:39,540 --> 00:17:41,240
They were not Asian.

480
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:42,240
Oh never mind.

481
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:43,240
They were wrong.

482
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:44,880
Vin Diesel confirmed that they were not.

483
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:45,880
You were wrong.

484
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:48,720
Yeah, I was completely wrong and I apologize.

485
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:55,280
I saw a video the other day, basically the Simpsons, the Simpsons decline, get this,

486
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:58,040
the death of satire people are saying.

487
00:17:58,040 --> 00:17:59,040
Wow.

488
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:00,600
Satire died with the Simpsons.

489
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:03,400
Because the Simpsons was the satire of what of...

490
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:04,560
It was a satire of Gen X.

491
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:06,560
A white family's skin color.

492
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:08,840
It was essentially...

493
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:11,840
What if a white family had a different skin color than white?

494
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:14,840
That's like the baseline satirical thing that's going on.

495
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:16,840
Why were they so obsessed with Butterfingers?

496
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:17,840
What?

497
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:18,840
The Simpson family.

498
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:20,840
Do they love Butterfingers?

499
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:25,840
Bart loved Butterfingers. When I think of Butterfingers, I think of Bart. I call him in my head Butterfinger Bart.

500
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:26,840
I think of my brother.

501
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:27,840
I call him Butterfinger Bart.

502
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:28,840
I don't think of anything.

503
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:29,840
My brain goes blank.

504
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:33,840
I think in my head Butterfinger Bart when I look at Butterfingers.

505
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:35,840
That makes no sense at all.

506
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:37,840
Because the inside is orange?

507
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:38,840
Yeah, you're being a little random.

508
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:45,280
No, I swear to God, there is a series of commercials for The Simpsons and then there was Butterfingers

509
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:46,280
in the show all the time.

510
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:49,040
Mate, mate, mate, when it comes to The Simpsons, you've lost the plot.

511
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:51,600
I don't want to hear another Simpsons opinion from you.

512
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:53,360
It's over for you with The Simpsons.

513
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:54,360
It's over for me with The Simpsons.

514
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:57,520
Get rid of The Simpsons from your brain, your house, your TV.

515
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:58,520
Delete that.

516
00:18:58,520 --> 00:18:59,520
Delete that shit.

517
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:00,520
It's out of your knowledge.

518
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:01,520
I don't want to hear you say that shit ever again.

519
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:04,080
I think that I don't know enough about The Simpsons to be talking about this stuff.

520
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:05,520
Have you watched all of it?

521
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:06,520
No.

522
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:09,920
I'm definitely speaking on The Simpsons with not much to back it up.

523
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:17,520
Okay, well, get this, the comic book guy loves movies and comic books.

524
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:18,520
Right.

525
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:21,840
So is this a fact that you're trying to...

526
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:24,760
I'm just showing that I have a functional understanding of The Simpsons.

527
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:27,400
His name is Comic Book Guy.

528
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:32,280
A working understanding of The Simpsons.

529
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:36,040
I'm just showing you guys that I know at least a little bit about The Simpsons.

530
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:37,840
know almost nothing. Comic book guy.

531
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:40,040
Comic book guy. He loves animated properties.

532
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:43,040
He works at a comic book store, but he's never that happy about it.

533
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:44,740
No, he doesn't. He's kind of missing.

534
00:19:44,740 --> 00:19:46,740
He doesn't like the people who like comic books.

535
00:19:46,740 --> 00:19:48,040
He's a motherfucker who loves to hate.

536
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:48,840
He's a hater.

537
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:49,540
You know what I've noticed?

538
00:19:49,540 --> 00:19:50,440
He's a born hater.

539
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:51,640
Do you ever feel like...

540
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:52,940
You gotta stop touching that.

541
00:19:52,940 --> 00:19:57,840
Do you ever feel like comic book guy, a lot of these people who work as baristas now,

542
00:19:57,840 --> 00:19:59,640
watched comic book guy and they said,

543
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:02,440
"I'm gonna become coffee shop, coffee store guy."

544
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:03,240
Coffee shop guy.

545
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:05,340
They stole his flow bar for bar.

546
00:20:05,340 --> 00:20:10,700
because you walk into yeah because that I feel like when I walk into a coffee shop

547
00:20:10,700 --> 00:20:13,020
everybody acting like comic book guy these days.

548
00:20:13,020 --> 00:20:18,140
Yeah and some comic books or some you want a cup of coffee we don't do that here.

549
00:20:18,140 --> 00:20:19,100
We actually don't have coffee.

550
00:20:19,100 --> 00:20:25,900
We do a mug of coffee or I walk in and I say can I have 40?

551
00:20:30,540 --> 00:20:32,540
Yeah, that's how they act now.

552
00:20:32,540 --> 00:20:37,540
I ask, can I have 40 or 50 scoops of vanilla ice cream in a cup?

553
00:20:37,540 --> 00:20:38,540
In a coffee, yeah.

554
00:20:38,540 --> 00:20:39,540
No coffee, please.

555
00:20:39,540 --> 00:20:40,540
And affogato.

556
00:20:40,540 --> 00:20:42,540
And they say we don't do that, actually.

557
00:20:42,540 --> 00:20:44,540
That's what they're, affogato?

558
00:20:44,540 --> 00:20:45,540
We actually don't do ice cream.

559
00:20:45,540 --> 00:20:46,540
Ice cream coffee.

560
00:20:46,540 --> 00:20:48,540
Shut the fuck up. Do ice cream.

561
00:20:48,540 --> 00:20:49,540
Yeah, they should do ice cream.

562
00:20:49,540 --> 00:20:51,540
Every coffee shop should have ice cream.

563
00:20:51,540 --> 00:20:54,540
If I didn't want ice cream in my coffee, I'd make it at home.

564
00:20:54,540 --> 00:20:57,540
Yeah, you think I can't press, well, it's a button I gotta press.

565
00:20:57,540 --> 00:21:02,500
put a pod in the thing of ice cream. I press the button, the coffee comes out, I throw the

566
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:06,060
pod in the backyard. And you think, listen, you think that I don't know, I can't make ice

567
00:21:06,060 --> 00:21:11,100
cream at home. I can. I learned how in second grade. I had an amazing idea just now. You

568
00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:17,300
use salt or liquid nitrogen. You put it in a plastic bag. It's fucking simple. That shit

569
00:21:17,300 --> 00:21:21,580
is easy. The fact that I want to come to your store and give you money to make it for me.

570
00:21:21,580 --> 00:21:26,180
Cameron, I got something that will calm you down. I'm calm. No, you were just, you were

571
00:21:26,180 --> 00:21:28,180
a you were popping off for you were steaming.

572
00:21:28,180 --> 00:21:29,380
You were reaching pot of clams.

573
00:21:29,380 --> 00:21:30,580
I was just thinking about ice cream.

574
00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:31,280
Shoo.

575
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:35,080
Keurig, but for ice cream.

576
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:37,680
How would that work mechanically?

577
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:39,280
It'll be cold Keurig.

578
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:40,580
It's already do that.

579
00:21:40,580 --> 00:21:44,380
It's a liquid nitrogen pump and it all goes into a pod.

580
00:21:44,380 --> 00:21:47,080
So you just thought of you've just invented an ice cream

581
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:47,780
factory.

582
00:21:47,780 --> 00:21:52,880
But it's an ice cream factory for the home.

583
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:59,480
Yeah, it's an ice cream. Cure egg. Yeah, I just pull it in and never no, no, no,

584
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:03,320
no, no, because they come the flavor. You have to load it. You have to load it

585
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:06,680
up before you make it. Yeah, it's not like a soft serve machine where it just

586
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:10,600
comes out and disappears. An ice cream line. Yeah, I know the ice cream. The

587
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:14,520
ice cream and the soft serve just shows up. No, you don't understand the ice

588
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:18,080
cream. Keurig you when you put it, you put in the ice cream in a container

589
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:21,120
that's only the size of a K cup, so it only makes that much ice cream at a

590
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:22,520
Yeah, it's one scoop.

591
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:25,200
And if you want more than one scoop,

592
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:27,760
if you want more than if you want more than one scoop,

593
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:30,400
you've got to do multiple K-Cups.

594
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:34,700
Would you be able to like take this to the one at work?

595
00:22:34,700 --> 00:22:36,700
Yeah, you can bring this to work.

596
00:22:36,700 --> 00:22:38,740
Do you need a special Keurig for it, I'm asking?

597
00:22:38,740 --> 00:22:41,780
Or do you like the ones that like it's like you can only use?

598
00:22:41,780 --> 00:22:45,080
What about a nanobot that transforms any machine into an ice cream maker?

599
00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:47,180
Like re-does everything?

600
00:22:47,180 --> 00:22:48,780
You're like the Transformers.

601
00:22:48,780 --> 00:22:50,520
I think that you're going to win the Transformers.

602
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:52,080
You're going to win next big adventure.

603
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:56,760
You know when the transformer gets the, uh, they dropped the all spark and the

604
00:22:56,760 --> 00:23:00,800
pulse Shia LaBeouf drops it and the pulse goes out and it turns it the vending

605
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:03,360
machine into the transformer and it's shooting sodas.

606
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:04,000
I have seen that.

607
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:07,200
That's probably the greatest scene in a movie of the past 20 years.

608
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:08,880
Why?

609
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:11,720
So this, this, the all spark is a giver of life.

610
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:16,600
It makes you, it makes, so here's, so a transformer, that's an alien.

611
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:17,000
Yes.

612
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:17,880
They have nothing to do.

613
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:20,440
They have nothing to do with an earth car, even though they might look like a

614
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:23,640
a fire truck or a Ferrari. It's a prank. That's just what they look like on their

615
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:27,560
planet. So, imagine you were a transformer and you brought your special cube to

616
00:23:27,560 --> 00:23:29,680
planet Earth, 'cause you were running away from your evil

617
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:36,080
enemies, really, and you accidentally drop your cube on the ground and it brings

618
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:40,400
to life a car and the car turns into one of you. Can you imagine how odd it

619
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:45,920
would be to go to another planet and people are driving, all the aliens are

620
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:48,120
driving things that look kinda like you?

621
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:55,120
I mean, also, you really are lucky. You're lucky in to like, yeah, exactly.

622
00:23:55,120 --> 00:24:01,120
Like, you've really lucked in to an easy disguise if you walk around an alien planet and people are like,

623
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:05,120
using arms to make food and shit, you know? That's easy.

624
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:10,120
So, the Transformers are not cars before they get to Earth?

625
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:12,120
They are cars before they get to Earth.

626
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:14,120
No, they're not. They're not.

627
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:17,840
they learn we have seen a nude transformer but they are fully nude on

628
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:19,600
the look at my search history you will

629
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:22,640
they go they show them on their planet i don't think their cars on their planet

630
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:24,360
but i'd like to imagine that they are

631
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:28,440
may i like that that that i've got the transformers should do movies the next

632
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:31,200
one should do a scene where that when they're doing their alternate history

633
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:32,720
they always do where they say that

634
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:36,400
here are a lot of men with a transformer or stuff like that

635
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:38,480
they should do one word

636
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:42,340
uh... that o_j_ simpson chase he was trying to transform that what and he had

637
00:24:42,340 --> 00:24:48,180
had no control. He was driving. He was driving. He was like tied. The Bronco

638
00:24:48,180 --> 00:24:54,020
decapitated the two people and then he used the seat belt like a lizard's

639
00:24:54,020 --> 00:24:57,460
tongue. They should do, and they should do JFK too. Grabbed him. The car was

640
00:24:57,460 --> 00:25:00,420
the one thing that did it to him. The car had a little gun. Oh my God. Oh my

641
00:25:00,420 --> 00:25:03,100
God. It has a little gun from the tire. That's why they never found a bullet,

642
00:25:03,100 --> 00:25:06,500
because it was a bolt or a nut. They were like, "Well, we found this bolt and

643
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:09,140
nut inside his head, but this can't come from a gun." That must have just always

644
00:25:09,180 --> 00:25:12,180
off the car. That must have fallen off the tire or something.

645
00:25:12,180 --> 00:25:15,180
Wow. I've just opened a whole new door in the Transformers universe.

646
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:17,180
This is so fucking brilliant, bro.

647
00:25:17,180 --> 00:25:18,180
Amelia Earhart.

648
00:25:18,180 --> 00:25:20,180
Amelia Earhart. It flew home.

649
00:25:20,180 --> 00:25:22,180
It flew her to space.

650
00:25:22,180 --> 00:25:23,180
If we were all the way to...

651
00:25:23,180 --> 00:25:25,180
What do they live on? The moon?

652
00:25:25,180 --> 00:25:27,180
What other stuff happened to Tiananmen Square?

653
00:25:27,180 --> 00:25:32,180
Tiananmen Square. The tank. The guy was like revving the fucking engine trying to hit that guy.

654
00:25:32,180 --> 00:25:33,180
Yeah.

655
00:25:33,180 --> 00:25:35,180
And then the Transformers said that...

656
00:25:35,180 --> 00:25:37,180
The Transformers really like groceries.

657
00:25:37,180 --> 00:25:38,980
so he just decided to try to go around.

658
00:25:38,980 --> 00:25:39,980
He was a grocery bot.

659
00:25:39,980 --> 00:25:40,980
Yeah.

660
00:25:40,980 --> 00:25:44,020
So what other famous cars and funny scenarios?

661
00:25:44,020 --> 00:25:45,860
Maybe Franz Ferdinand.

662
00:25:45,860 --> 00:25:47,580
Yeah, Franz Ferdinand's car.

663
00:25:47,580 --> 00:25:49,500
I mean that's the same as JFK though.

664
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:51,980
But it's slightly different.

665
00:25:51,980 --> 00:25:54,900
It's slightly different but I think there's a very clear...

666
00:25:54,900 --> 00:25:59,100
Listen, it's obvious, it's maybe too obvious, but it's 9/11.

667
00:25:59,100 --> 00:26:00,100
Yeah.

668
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:03,740
Yeah, both of the buildings were Transformers and they transformed.

669
00:26:03,740 --> 00:26:06,780
Yeah, they transformed into rubble because they were bored.

670
00:26:06,780 --> 00:26:07,820
Yeah.

671
00:26:07,820 --> 00:26:11,660
Or they're transformed into rubble as a protection.

672
00:26:11,660 --> 00:26:14,300
Can a transformer be a building?

673
00:26:14,300 --> 00:26:16,140
Yeah, I don't have we seen that.

674
00:26:16,140 --> 00:26:17,620
I was wondering, could they be a gun?

675
00:26:17,620 --> 00:26:19,180
Wasn't there one? Megatron was a gun.

676
00:26:19,180 --> 00:26:20,340
Yeah, Megatron was like a Walther.

677
00:26:20,340 --> 00:26:21,380
This is easy.

678
00:26:21,380 --> 00:26:22,300
Yeah, every gun.

679
00:26:22,300 --> 00:26:24,420
Every fucking gun that has ever been used.

680
00:26:24,420 --> 00:26:25,460
Yeah.

681
00:26:25,460 --> 00:26:26,620
I mean, that would be my defense.

682
00:26:26,620 --> 00:26:27,420
Yeah.

683
00:26:27,420 --> 00:26:28,460
You're on it.

684
00:26:28,460 --> 00:26:32,540
The first thing at first I'm using my Blackberry and then all of a sudden it's

685
00:26:32,540 --> 00:26:34,540
shooting three or four people on the street.

686
00:26:34,540 --> 00:26:35,540
Yeah.

687
00:26:35,540 --> 00:26:38,540
My Blackberry became an AR-15 out of nowhere.

688
00:26:38,540 --> 00:26:39,540
Not my fault.

689
00:26:39,540 --> 00:26:40,540
Not my fault.

690
00:26:40,540 --> 00:26:41,540
Not my fault.

691
00:26:41,540 --> 00:26:42,540
Also, I had Heelys on.

692
00:26:42,540 --> 00:26:43,540
I still use a Blackberry.

693
00:26:43,540 --> 00:26:45,540
And they were also Transformers because they have wheels.

694
00:26:45,540 --> 00:26:47,540
Yeah, and I'm a Transformer.

695
00:26:47,540 --> 00:26:49,540
So, your legal system doesn't apply to me.

696
00:26:49,540 --> 00:26:51,540
Yeah, I'm a sovereign citizen as well.

697
00:26:51,540 --> 00:26:55,540
I would like to be able to transform, but I think that...

698
00:26:55,540 --> 00:26:57,540
What would you transform to?

699
00:26:57,540 --> 00:27:00,540
I think right now I'd transform into a car because I need a car.

700
00:27:00,540 --> 00:27:01,540
Yeah, that's true.

701
00:27:01,540 --> 00:27:04,980
That's true and it'd be easier to just be a car because then I wouldn't have to park

702
00:27:04,980 --> 00:27:08,820
anything. I just parked my ass on the couch. Exactly. You couldn't be a car on the couch.

703
00:27:08,820 --> 00:27:12,660
Well, you could change back, I guess. Never mind. If I was a trans. I'm saying I want

704
00:27:12,660 --> 00:27:22,180
to be a transformer. I want to be a car forever, man. Come on, dude. You wanted to be a car

705
00:27:22,180 --> 00:27:27,420
for I don't want to be a car forever. I'm so sick of my fucking life. The daily grind,

706
00:27:27,420 --> 00:27:32,300
hustle my god. I wish I could just be a car. Watching cars like they're like horses galloping

707
00:27:32,300 --> 00:27:36,380
in a field. They're so free. Oh my god. They can they can go wherever they want. You think

708
00:27:36,380 --> 00:27:41,420
that's how the car fuckers look at them? What's a car fucker? Remember that from Mancers? The

709
00:27:41,420 --> 00:27:46,700
guy that was like or A Thousand Ways to Die is the guy that like they put like the beer koozies in

710
00:27:46,700 --> 00:27:52,140
the exhaust pipe and then they fuck the cars. Dude at that point just fucking fuck the wall.

711
00:27:52,140 --> 00:27:54,140
Why are you fucking a car?

712
00:27:54,140 --> 00:27:56,140
Put a hole in the wall with a beer can

713
00:27:56,140 --> 00:27:58,140
I mean at that point

714
00:27:58,140 --> 00:28:00,140
I mean, you know, a celsius can

715
00:28:00,140 --> 00:28:02,140
and then fuck that hole

716
00:28:02,140 --> 00:28:04,140
Why do you need to

717
00:28:04,140 --> 00:28:06,140
Why does it have to be

718
00:28:06,140 --> 00:28:08,140
You know why

719
00:28:08,140 --> 00:28:10,140
Don't ask me that question

720
00:28:10,140 --> 00:28:12,140
A beer can? You think you can

721
00:28:12,140 --> 00:28:14,140
You think this would be anything

722
00:28:14,140 --> 00:28:16,140
Imagine you're about to have sex with a woman and you look at her vagina

723
00:28:16,140 --> 00:28:18,140
and it's this wide

724
00:28:20,140 --> 00:28:24,340
you call your mom, you're getting picked up. Yeah, I'm not going. But that's the

725
00:28:24,340 --> 00:28:27,180
thing. The thing about those guys that I'm not even taking my clothes off.

726
00:28:27,180 --> 00:28:30,180
Yeah, this is not work because I don't take my clothes off until she's fully

727
00:28:30,180 --> 00:28:31,700
making me the whole

728
00:28:31,700 --> 00:28:35,500
your legs.

729
00:28:35,500 --> 00:28:39,700
And I'm standing with my arms crossed. I like nope too big. Bye

730
00:28:39,700 --> 00:28:45,500
later. Take a quick flash. Can you can you call me an Uber? I have to go.

731
00:28:46,100 --> 00:28:51,700
I have to go in my foot. My apple pay is now. I have the ruler app on my phone,

732
00:28:51,700 --> 00:28:52,620
the like distance

733
00:28:52,620 --> 00:28:56,880
looks like it's twelve inches. Why

734
00:28:56,880 --> 00:29:03,420
me and me and Sam were laughing so hard the other day about about like going to

735
00:29:03,420 --> 00:29:09,020
like we he took me to the tow company to like try to get my car back and I talked

736
00:29:09,020 --> 00:29:11,900
to the lady and then she was like, oh, you actually need this other piece of

737
00:29:11,900 --> 00:29:15,260
paper like you can't get the car today. I was like, okay, we're laughing so hard

738
00:29:15,300 --> 00:29:19,240
about being like, okay, sorry about that. And then just taking a photo over with

739
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:19,340
the

740
00:29:19,340 --> 00:29:25,160
iPhone.

741
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:29,360
Okay, thank you so much.

742
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:37,660
She's trying to ask you why you took the photo.

743
00:29:37,660 --> 00:29:39,960
Later. Thank you so much.

744
00:29:44,100 --> 00:29:47,780
You have one of those like phones from Japan that has like the really loud

745
00:29:47,780 --> 00:29:48,620
shutter click.

746
00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:52,140
Yeah. You have to unfold your phone. You have a foldable phone.

747
00:29:52,140 --> 00:29:54,300
You unfold it, take a flash photo and leave.

748
00:29:54,300 --> 00:30:02,060
It just works at any place where somebody is just working there.

749
00:30:02,060 --> 00:30:05,460
Yeah. Taking a picture of your, like the drive-through guy.

750
00:30:05,460 --> 00:30:06,980
Yeah. Thank you so much.

751
00:30:06,980 --> 00:30:09,220
Wait, hold on.

752
00:30:09,220 --> 00:30:12,500
I love taking pictures of people.

753
00:30:12,660 --> 00:30:19,940
Yeah, I wanted to take a oh man. Fuck. I told you guys about a guy I saw at the

754
00:30:19,940 --> 00:30:26,500
airport on my way back from California who had the craziest facial hair I've

755
00:30:26,500 --> 00:30:31,980
ever seen where he had. Oh yeah. One half of his face had a mustache and then he

756
00:30:31,980 --> 00:30:36,060
shaved the other half of his mustache. But on that side he had a full beard.

757
00:30:36,060 --> 00:30:40,140
Yeah. So it was half and half. He had windows antivirus. And I really, really

758
00:30:40,140 --> 00:30:46,700
wanted to take a photo of him, but he looked at me the entire time as a measure. I was playing

759
00:30:46,700 --> 00:30:50,380
the hide from the teacher flash game with him. I could see his cone of vision was very

760
00:30:50,380 --> 00:30:52,100
wide too, his eyes were offset.

761
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:58,960
Yeah. Did I ever, when I was living in Manchester, I saw these like, I saw this couple walking

762
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:04,260
down the street one day, full Harley Quinn cosplay.

763
00:31:04,260 --> 00:31:05,620
Both of them?

764
00:31:05,620 --> 00:31:07,980
Then the man had green hair.

765
00:31:07,980 --> 00:31:09,980
That's nothing dude.

766
00:31:09,980 --> 00:31:11,980
What do you mean that's nothing?

767
00:31:11,980 --> 00:31:13,980
That's a Joker couple that doesn't have a car.

768
00:31:13,980 --> 00:31:15,980
Let me guess, it was on Halloween.

769
00:31:15,980 --> 00:31:17,980
No, it was August.

770
00:31:17,980 --> 00:31:19,980
August is close enough to Halloween that any costumes are acceptable.

771
00:31:19,980 --> 00:31:21,980
Alright.

772
00:31:21,980 --> 00:31:23,980
You're telling your story is that you saw

773
00:31:23,980 --> 00:31:25,980
somebody wearing a costume.

774
00:31:25,980 --> 00:31:27,980
I saw a Joker couple.

775
00:31:27,980 --> 00:31:29,980
That guy was not even Joker.

776
00:31:29,980 --> 00:31:31,980
He had grand hair, he's the Joker.

777
00:31:31,980 --> 00:31:33,980
I sent you guys a picture of this. I saw Chris Griffin taking stuff out of my trash.

778
00:31:33,980 --> 00:31:35,980
Oh yeah.

779
00:31:35,980 --> 00:31:40,740
exact. He was. Something that Patrick had talked about for, I mean, so this was a crazy experience

780
00:31:40,740 --> 00:31:44,740
for me because Patrick talked about this for like probably 10 months straight. Yeah. The

781
00:31:44,740 --> 00:31:49,260
idea of seeing somebody dressed as Chris Griffin. Yeah. And we always kept saying, "Patrick,

782
00:31:49,260 --> 00:31:52,180
that's stupid. That doesn't make any sense." Yeah. You wouldn't see somebody and be like,

783
00:31:52,180 --> 00:31:54,940
"That's Chris Griffin. That's not an outfit that would register." But you did see it. And

784
00:31:54,940 --> 00:31:59,120
I hear, I'm walking out of my house to leave, to go to the office. I hear somebody go through

785
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:04,380
my recycling. I open the door and I just immediately first thought, "Oh my God, that's Chris Griffin."

786
00:32:04,380 --> 00:32:06,580
It's the it's vindicated.

787
00:32:06,580 --> 00:32:07,820
Exact shirt, pants and hat.

788
00:32:07,820 --> 00:32:09,580
I was so right about this.

789
00:32:09,580 --> 00:32:14,580
It was, but to be fair, I wouldn't have thought it unless you hadn't made that video.

790
00:32:14,580 --> 00:32:15,580
You would have thought it.

791
00:32:15,580 --> 00:32:16,580
No, I wouldn't have.

792
00:32:16,580 --> 00:32:18,580
He was also, he was portly.

793
00:32:18,580 --> 00:32:20,140
Yeah, like Chris Griffin.

794
00:32:20,140 --> 00:32:21,140
Like Chris Griffin.

795
00:32:21,140 --> 00:32:23,940
I mean, seeing a skinny Chris Griffin, you're not going to think about it.

796
00:32:23,940 --> 00:32:25,420
Was he a dunce?

797
00:32:25,420 --> 00:32:26,420
Was he a dunce?

798
00:32:26,420 --> 00:32:28,460
Yeah, well he's getting recycling, so.

799
00:32:28,460 --> 00:32:30,180
I mean, he thinks trash is food.

800
00:32:30,180 --> 00:32:32,100
He likes trash.

801
00:32:32,100 --> 00:32:33,100
The people who live.

802
00:32:33,100 --> 00:32:34,460
thought my house was a store.

803
00:32:34,460 --> 00:32:38,500
A guy who thinks that homeless people just eat cans.

804
00:32:38,500 --> 00:32:40,740
That's what they're doing.

805
00:32:40,740 --> 00:32:41,780
They're transformers.

806
00:32:41,780 --> 00:32:44,000
All these fucking, these homeless drug addicts eating my cans.

807
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,840
What do you mean? They're going through the soda cans to try and get a drop of soda out of them.

808
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:49,800
That adds up eventually.

809
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:50,640
Yeah.

810
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:53,180
That's over a four-seventh day, you could almost get a swig.

811
00:32:53,180 --> 00:32:54,780
The family that lives under me,

812
00:32:54,780 --> 00:32:59,080
they moved in and I've been smelling this awful, awful smell every time I walk by

813
00:32:59,080 --> 00:33:01,880
their apartment and I've been thinking they've just been making a fucked up fish.

814
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:02,400
Yeah.

815
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:05,900
and it turns out no no nobody has passed away in that apartment,

816
00:33:05,900 --> 00:33:07,740
although they do cry all the time, but

817
00:33:07,740 --> 00:33:09,840
what

818
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:11,640
I always

819
00:33:11,640 --> 00:33:15,640
I always see the mom like outside of the apartment, just like

820
00:33:15,640 --> 00:33:20,840
maybe yeah, yeah, maybe it's because of the smell. I think it

821
00:33:20,840 --> 00:33:25,440
is because they do the can thing and I found that out that the

822
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:28,640
smell was just like stinky beer, old beer. Yeah, but I'm so

823
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:31,640
stupid that I thought it was fish. Yeah, but they're nice

824
00:33:31,640 --> 00:33:33,640
people. I let them, they never have their keys.

825
00:33:33,640 --> 00:33:34,640
You let them in your house?

826
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:37,640
They never have their keys so I always have to let them into the apartment.

827
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:38,640
Okay.

828
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:39,640
Okay.

829
00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:40,640
Yeah, but they're very good people.

830
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:44,640
You're saying that like you're like, you're like how, giving them like the shirt off your

831
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:45,640
back.

832
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:46,640
I mean, that's pretty sweet of me.

833
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:47,640
That's a nice thing to do.

834
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:49,040
It's not sweet, it's kind of just expected.

835
00:33:49,040 --> 00:33:52,340
They come in and they stink up the whole apartment and I'm still letting them in all the time

836
00:33:52,340 --> 00:33:55,000
with the cans.

837
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:56,000
That's fine.

838
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,040
But it made me think that maybe you could make some decent money doing that.

839
00:33:58,040 --> 00:34:00,240
Oh, you make pretty good money. It's five cents per can.

840
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:01,240
I love to look.

841
00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:02,360
Yeah, you didn't know that?

842
00:34:02,360 --> 00:34:03,360
High me 5 cents.

843
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:04,360
You never collected cans?

844
00:34:04,360 --> 00:34:05,360
No.

845
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:08,100
I did that all the time as a kid.

846
00:34:08,100 --> 00:34:11,040
I didn't live in a place where you could walk around and get cans like that.

847
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:12,760
Well, you just get them.

848
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:15,280
I've been giving my cans out.

849
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:16,280
You take them to the grocery store?

850
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:17,280
I leave them.

851
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:20,440
Honestly, it's less about the money you get and more about the funness of putting the

852
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:22,440
can into the thing with the two wheels.

853
00:34:22,440 --> 00:34:23,440
It looks so fun.

854
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:24,440
Oh my God.

855
00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:25,440
Have you never done it?

856
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:26,440
I've never done it.

857
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:27,440
It sucks it in.

858
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:29,480
I've known that it's 5 cents per can.

859
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:34,440
I just leave my cans out on top of the trash barrel so that the guys who dig for them can

860
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:35,440
get them.

861
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:36,440
I put it under oil.

862
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:39,960
I put it under an oil slick so when they try to grab it they slip.

863
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:44,960
I love when I hear someone going through my cans, I look at them.

864
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:46,120
I watch them do it.

865
00:34:46,120 --> 00:34:48,640
Because you say that you're stealing money out of my pocket.

866
00:34:48,640 --> 00:34:50,040
Just so they know that I'm here.

867
00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:51,800
You'll never get my full soda.

868
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:53,760
I just want them to know that I'm watching them.

869
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:54,760
That one was mine.

870
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:55,760
That can was mine.

871
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:56,760
I drank that.

872
00:34:56,760 --> 00:34:59,920
that window right there and I just look down and I have no expression on my face. I just

873
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:01,840
watch them the entire time they do it.

874
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:02,840
You're not getting my soda.

875
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:03,840
No, I don't.

876
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:04,840
I already drank my soda.

877
00:35:04,840 --> 00:35:06,740
I just want to look at them do it.

878
00:35:06,740 --> 00:35:07,740
You think those are full.

879
00:35:07,740 --> 00:35:08,740
Nuh-uh.

880
00:35:08,740 --> 00:35:09,740
I already drank all that.

881
00:35:09,740 --> 00:35:12,380
Just to make sure they don't take any. Just to make sure they don't try to take the rest

882
00:35:12,380 --> 00:35:13,380
of the trash.

883
00:35:13,380 --> 00:35:14,380
Oh yeah.

884
00:35:14,380 --> 00:35:15,380
Because then I'm not going to throw it away.

885
00:35:15,380 --> 00:35:16,380
The trash belongs to the city.

886
00:35:16,380 --> 00:35:20,320
I have a little bit of sentimental value with my cans though. Sometimes I'll look into my

887
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:23,920
recycling bin and I'll go, "I don't remember that one."

888
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:24,920
Yeah.

889
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:25,920
You ever do that?

890
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:28,420
I do that. I don't drink anything from a can.

891
00:35:28,420 --> 00:35:32,720
Okay, Rich. He drinks out of boxes.

892
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:34,720
Yeah, Mr. Boxed Wine over here.

893
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:36,720
Boxed Wine, Boxed Beer.

894
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:38,720
I should go back to the canned wine.

895
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:40,720
Boxed Chardonnay.

896
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:42,720
Would you drink a beer in a box?

897
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:44,720
I don't think I would. I feel like it would eat me.

898
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:46,720
It would definitely be bad, but I would still drink it.

899
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:48,720
You would drink it.

900
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:50,720
I feel like it would eat up the box.

901
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:52,720
What if your friend made it?

902
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:54,720
Let me ask you a question that I asked Julio a while ago

903
00:35:54,720 --> 00:36:00,220
he couldn't wrap his head around. Yeah, that so so you go to the grocery store.

904
00:36:00,220 --> 00:36:06,820
Yeah, you go to the meat section. Okay, looking at the the raw whole chickens

905
00:36:06,820 --> 00:36:10,020
polio polio. Exactly. Maybe you should have said that you should have said

906
00:36:10,020 --> 00:36:12,920
that's what yeah, that didn't seem to be the stumbling point for him. Okay,

907
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:15,620
you're looking at all the raw whole chickens because you're going to buy a

908
00:36:15,620 --> 00:36:19,220
raw whole chicken. Okay, you're going down the line. You're looking at them.

909
00:36:19,220 --> 00:36:23,620
You get to one this chicken. It looks exactly the same as all the others. It

910
00:36:23,620 --> 00:36:26,000
It costs the same amount.

911
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:27,220
It's packaged up.

912
00:36:27,220 --> 00:36:28,920
You grab it, you pick it up to put it in your cart.

913
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:30,360
You look at the label.

914
00:36:30,360 --> 00:36:39,300
The label on it, it says peanut butter chicken.

915
00:36:39,300 --> 00:36:42,220
So are you going to buy it or are you going to put it back?

916
00:36:42,220 --> 00:36:43,460
Probably put it back.

917
00:36:43,460 --> 00:36:45,460
Okay, only if they have jelly chicken.

918
00:36:45,460 --> 00:36:46,460
You don't even want to try it.

919
00:36:46,460 --> 00:36:47,460
Well, okay.

920
00:36:47,460 --> 00:36:50,940
You don't even, there's no curiosity in your mind when you see in a grocery store something

921
00:36:50,940 --> 00:36:54,480
called peanut butter chicken that you can't tell in any visible way why I

922
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:56,580
called that. You wouldn't buy that even to find out.

923
00:36:56,580 --> 00:37:00,380
Certainly there's curiosity, but I'm not sure that I'm willing to spend eight

924
00:37:00,380 --> 00:37:03,020
bucks to have a chicken that maybe I'm not even going to eat.

925
00:37:03,020 --> 00:37:07,100
You're not thinking of any type of recipes at all?

926
00:37:07,100 --> 00:37:11,620
I'm thinking immediately peanut butter. I'm thinking satay, maybe making that.

927
00:37:11,620 --> 00:37:12,340
Right. Yeah.

928
00:37:12,340 --> 00:37:12,740
Okay.

929
00:37:12,740 --> 00:37:13,740
You don't have a curious mind.

930
00:37:13,740 --> 00:37:15,260
Let's say you do a smaller piece of a chicken then.

931
00:37:15,260 --> 00:37:17,180
What about a rotisserie peanut butter chicken?

932
00:37:17,180 --> 00:37:19,220
$6.99?

933
00:37:19,220 --> 00:37:19,620
Yeah.

934
00:37:20,260 --> 00:37:23,760
Hey, why is it cheaper than the regular peanut butter chicken?

935
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:25,260
Where I did that.

936
00:37:25,260 --> 00:37:26,060
With peanut butter?

937
00:37:26,060 --> 00:37:26,960
Yeah, with peanut butter too.

938
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:27,660
Oh, okay.

939
00:37:27,660 --> 00:37:30,260
Where's my quote?

940
00:37:30,260 --> 00:37:31,060
Why don't they put every...

941
00:37:31,060 --> 00:37:34,160
I should have a rotisserie option for everything, get a little discount.

942
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:34,660
Yeah.

943
00:37:34,660 --> 00:37:37,560
Why doesn't the grocery store have kebabs?

944
00:37:37,560 --> 00:37:38,360
But the...

945
00:37:38,360 --> 00:37:40,360
They got the rotisserie.

946
00:37:40,360 --> 00:37:41,560
I would buy the rotisserie.

947
00:37:41,560 --> 00:37:43,060
You only put chicken on there?

948
00:37:43,060 --> 00:37:47,160
I would assume that the peanut butter chicken is going to follow the same

949
00:37:47,660 --> 00:37:51,440
naming logic as beer can chicken.

950
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:54,740
Where somebody maybe just shoved a can of peanut butter.

951
00:37:54,740 --> 00:37:56,440
Well, they're putting a can of peanut butter in there.

952
00:37:56,440 --> 00:38:00,440
That means the whole interior of that chicken is covered and coated in plastic.

953
00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:06,520
Yeah, so I guess my first thing that I would do when I got home was cut it open to see

954
00:38:06,520 --> 00:38:08,000
if there's peanut butter in the middle.

955
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:11,280
Yeah, I guess I would definitely cut it open before I cook it.

956
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:15,480
If there is, then I'll probably just take it out.

957
00:38:15,480 --> 00:38:21,320
So, well, no, you take that peanut butter, you cook it down into a little

958
00:38:21,320 --> 00:38:25,480
even this was no room for what the chicken actually ends up being. This is

959
00:38:25,480 --> 00:38:29,080
fully a grocery store scenario. Well, then no, I don't it ends at the

960
00:38:29,080 --> 00:38:33,000
grocery store. I don't buy it if I don't if yeah, no, I'm buying it. Best

961
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:37,880
case scenario, I'm a peanut butter chicken, but I think we can maybe do a

962
00:38:37,880 --> 00:38:42,360
really interesting psychological study. The best case scenario is that you

963
00:38:42,360 --> 00:38:46,500
he also would not buy the peanut butter. You get a jar of peanut butter for

964
00:38:46,500 --> 00:38:51,500
free. No, it's not. No, you don't get a jar of the best case scenario is

965
00:38:51,500 --> 00:38:54,520
you cook the peanut butter chicken and it tastes delicious and it has some

966
00:38:54,520 --> 00:38:57,180
type of peanut butter flavor that you never thought could taste the way it

967
00:38:57,180 --> 00:39:00,480
does. It's the nuttiness. That's the best case scenario. Yeah, the nuttiness

968
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:01,640
infused in the chicken. But the best case scenario is you get a jar of

969
00:39:01,640 --> 00:39:05,680
peanut butter inside the chicken. What do you think that's the best case

970
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:09,320
scenario? That's a medium case scenario. That's a normal case scenario. The

971
00:39:09,320 --> 00:39:12,960
scenario is the peanut butter chicken tastes good. Yeah, that's good.

972
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:15,480
And that's the best case scenario is any chicken.

973
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:19,640
No, any chicken you could buy could taste really good.

974
00:39:19,640 --> 00:39:22,000
Peanut butter chicken is chicken. Yeah, that's what I mean.

975
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,240
So that's that's just a chicken.

976
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:26,440
Wait, so it's a chicken raised on a diet of peanut butter?

977
00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:27,040
No, no, no, no, no, no.

978
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:31,720
Because the best case scenario for any piece of chicken

979
00:39:31,720 --> 00:39:34,400
is that it's better than any other chicken you've ever eaten.

980
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:35,200
Yes. Yeah.

981
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:37,040
Well, that could be true for peanut butter chicken.

982
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:39,040
It could be true for any other chicken in the store.

983
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:40,300
Hold the phone. Hold the phone.

984
00:39:40,300 --> 00:39:41,640
Right. But there's a difference.

985
00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:45,240
We can't ask any questions about why it's called peanut butter chicken.

986
00:39:45,240 --> 00:39:46,380
That's what he says.

987
00:39:46,380 --> 00:39:48,080
No, because I don't know why.

988
00:39:48,080 --> 00:39:49,120
You don't? OK.

989
00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:50,320
This is the worst hypothetical.

990
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:52,920
Obviously, peanut butter chicken does not exist.

991
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:54,480
No, no. It's hypothetical.

992
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:55,080
Yeah, exactly.

993
00:39:55,080 --> 00:39:57,420
So it will exist is the thing.

994
00:39:57,420 --> 00:39:59,620
So how will I know what it is if it doesn't exist?

995
00:39:59,620 --> 00:40:01,460
Your question answered the questions.

996
00:40:01,460 --> 00:40:02,600
No, it's a thought experiment.

997
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:03,620
Buddy, it's it's not.

998
00:40:03,620 --> 00:40:04,660
I don't have an answer.

999
00:40:04,660 --> 00:40:06,060
It is the worst experiment.

1000
00:40:06,060 --> 00:40:08,940
I mean, you finished the experiment. You guys are just pushing it onward to eating it.

1001
00:40:08,940 --> 00:40:10,540
It's not about eating it. It's about buying it.

1002
00:40:10,540 --> 00:40:14,540
What do you mean? It's all about eating it. That's what I mean.

1003
00:40:14,540 --> 00:40:18,700
There is no, it's not about it, but it's all about eating it.

1004
00:40:18,700 --> 00:40:21,100
At its core, it could be the label.

1005
00:40:21,100 --> 00:40:24,540
It's a question about a consumer's curiosity.

1006
00:40:24,540 --> 00:40:27,900
Then at that point, if it doesn't have anything to do with how it tastes or what,

1007
00:40:27,900 --> 00:40:29,260
or, and I don't know anything about it,

1008
00:40:29,260 --> 00:40:33,580
then the piece of chicken could say anything different than the other pieces of

1009
00:40:33,580 --> 00:40:37,900
chicken. Yeah. No, he's right. He's right. He's right. It is. It is a

1010
00:40:37,900 --> 00:40:42,340
question about I did get too hung up on the thought of eating it. It is

1011
00:40:42,340 --> 00:40:46,060
about the consumer curiosity. How you act in the grocery store. I act

1012
00:40:46,060 --> 00:40:49,940
polite. I let no, no, no, no. What if you would buy a weird food? Yeah,

1013
00:40:49,940 --> 00:40:53,780
I like that. And you're completely right that it doesn't have to. It

1014
00:40:53,780 --> 00:40:57,660
could be jelly chicken. Yeah. Why is it? Jelly and peanut? I mean, just

1015
00:40:57,660 --> 00:41:02,180
pick. Those are just the first thing. Okay, see, the point is, it has to

1016
00:41:02,180 --> 00:41:04,180
weird enough that you have to be curious in order to buy it.

1017
00:41:04,180 --> 00:41:06,180
The first two things you thought of were peanut butter and jelly?

1018
00:41:06,180 --> 00:41:09,180
Well, the second thing I thought of was jelly because I was thinking about peanut butter.

1019
00:41:09,180 --> 00:41:15,180
The thing you also have to think about in this, right, you replace chicken with chips.

1020
00:41:15,180 --> 00:41:16,180
Okay.

1021
00:41:16,180 --> 00:41:18,180
That's more grounded.

1022
00:41:18,180 --> 00:41:19,180
Exactly.

1023
00:41:19,180 --> 00:41:24,180
See, that's the thing where any person would probably get the weird chip because it's normal to try a weird chip.

1024
00:41:24,180 --> 00:41:26,180
It's also low stakes.

1025
00:41:26,180 --> 00:41:29,180
Very low stakes. High stakes is what a chicken is.

1026
00:41:29,180 --> 00:41:30,620
Exactly. So this is testing.

1027
00:41:30,620 --> 00:41:37,820
If I'm buying a whole chicken, that means I have some recipe planned. Peanut butter may

1028
00:41:37,820 --> 00:41:42,140
not really be a part of what I have planned. I might be thinking I'm doing some kind of

1029
00:41:42,140 --> 00:41:47,220
slow roasted thing. All of a sudden it's a mole.

1030
00:41:47,220 --> 00:41:55,640
See for me, I would try it. I would buy it even if I was worried that it would completely

1031
00:41:55,640 --> 00:41:59,220
be horrible and be ruined, I would be okay with throwing it away just for the chance

1032
00:41:59,220 --> 00:42:00,480
to try peanut butter chicken and see what the deal is.

1033
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:03,680
I would love to try peanut butter chicken genuinely.

1034
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:04,680
This is not...

1035
00:42:04,680 --> 00:42:05,680
And try making it.

1036
00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:09,240
I guess I do not have an adventurous childlike Peter Pan spirit.

1037
00:42:09,240 --> 00:42:10,720
Peter Pan is a brand of peanut butter.

1038
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:12,200
Yeah, it's a type of peanut butter.

1039
00:42:12,200 --> 00:42:13,200
And I definitely don't.

1040
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:17,800
What if the label is just a big Peter Pan logo with a chicken on it?

1041
00:42:17,800 --> 00:42:19,800
That, see I'm more tempted to try that.

1042
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:22,980
Yeah, what if you bought that because you thought, oh, they spread out, they're doing

1043
00:42:22,980 --> 00:42:25,940
chicken now instead of just peanut butter. You get home, you cook it and it's peanut

1044
00:42:25,940 --> 00:42:33,060
butter flavored. Or it's like they have the canned chicken. You ever seen that? The canned

1045
00:42:33,060 --> 00:42:39,700
whole chicken? I think so. Jarred whole peanut butter chicken. Jarred whole peanut butter.

1046
00:42:39,700 --> 00:42:45,980
Whole big peanut? You guys ever do the machine at the grocery store that makes the peanut

1047
00:42:45,980 --> 00:42:49,780
butter? No, but I gotta start doing that. What? The machine where you press a button. They

1048
00:42:49,780 --> 00:42:52,980
They had let be fresh in Austin, Massachusetts.

1049
00:42:52,980 --> 00:42:54,380
I've never heard of this in my life.

1050
00:42:54,380 --> 00:42:55,380
You've never heard of this?

1051
00:42:55,380 --> 00:42:56,380
It makes peanut butter?

1052
00:42:56,380 --> 00:42:58,580
They have a peanut butter one and an almond butter one.

1053
00:42:58,580 --> 00:42:59,580
Yeah.

1054
00:42:59,580 --> 00:43:01,900
And you can make honey roasted peanut butter.

1055
00:43:01,900 --> 00:43:03,620
I never did know about this.

1056
00:43:03,620 --> 00:43:04,620
Yeah.

1057
00:43:04,620 --> 00:43:05,620
I never did know about this.

1058
00:43:05,620 --> 00:43:07,940
You can get fresh peanut butter at the store.

1059
00:43:07,940 --> 00:43:08,940
It's good as fuck.

1060
00:43:08,940 --> 00:43:10,140
I don't think they have that at my store.

1061
00:43:10,140 --> 00:43:13,180
They don't have it at any of the stores around here, but if you go to like the Wegmans.

1062
00:43:13,180 --> 00:43:14,260
We live in a food desert.

1063
00:43:14,260 --> 00:43:19,800
If you go to the Wegmans in Dumbo, I think they got it there.

1064
00:43:19,800 --> 00:43:21,980
That's the biggest grocery store I've ever seen.

1065
00:43:21,980 --> 00:43:24,340
Who the hell named that fucking neighborhood, bro?

1066
00:43:24,340 --> 00:43:25,340
Dumbo?

1067
00:43:25,340 --> 00:43:37,060
Because it's "Duh Under My Brooklyn Bridge Oh No I don't know."

1068
00:43:37,060 --> 00:43:39,780
Down Under Manhattan Bridge Overpass.

1069
00:43:39,780 --> 00:43:41,860
Is that really what it means?

1070
00:43:41,860 --> 00:43:43,860
So you knew the whole time?

1071
00:43:43,860 --> 00:43:46,340
You made me look like a dumbo.

1072
00:43:46,340 --> 00:43:48,060
I thought you were going to do something funny.

1073
00:43:48,060 --> 00:43:51,100
I thought I was, I don't know, I was floundering.

1074
00:43:51,100 --> 00:43:53,300
I was floundering.

1075
00:43:53,300 --> 00:43:55,100
Yeah, I wasn't going to bail you out with the actual one.

1076
00:43:55,100 --> 00:43:57,020
You could have bailed me out with the actual one.

1077
00:43:57,020 --> 00:43:58,380
I was going to let you flounder.

1078
00:43:58,380 --> 00:44:00,860
You just wanted to see me fail.

1079
00:44:00,860 --> 00:44:03,820
He's mad about the peanut butter chicken thing

1080
00:44:03,820 --> 00:44:05,740
and he's still going to let us fail.

1081
00:44:05,740 --> 00:44:07,780
I do not care about peanut butter chicken.

1082
00:44:07,780 --> 00:44:09,300
You've made it clear.

1083
00:44:09,300 --> 00:44:10,580
You care so much.

1084
00:44:10,580 --> 00:44:11,820
I don't care even enough to,

1085
00:44:11,820 --> 00:44:13,660
I wouldn't even pick it up at the store.

1086
00:44:13,660 --> 00:44:16,380
I know you wouldn't pick it up.

1087
00:44:16,380 --> 00:44:17,420
You would pick it up and you would read the label.

1088
00:44:17,420 --> 00:44:18,420
That's the question.

1089
00:44:18,420 --> 00:44:19,740
I wouldn't even pick it up to look at it.

1090
00:44:19,740 --> 00:44:22,100
You know what would happen?

1091
00:44:22,100 --> 00:44:23,100
You know what would happen?

1092
00:44:23,100 --> 00:44:26,460
If he found peanut butter chicken at the store, he would pick it up.

1093
00:44:26,460 --> 00:44:27,860
Get out of my person's face.

1094
00:44:27,860 --> 00:44:28,900
He would pick it up and go.

1095
00:44:28,900 --> 00:44:33,340
And then he would come in here next day and go, "You know what I saw at the

1096
00:44:33,340 --> 00:44:34,340
store?"

1097
00:44:34,340 --> 00:44:38,860
These stores are selling a peanut butter chicken.

1098
00:44:38,860 --> 00:44:40,420
But that's what I would do, too.

1099
00:44:40,460 --> 00:44:43,340
But I would say I bought it and I ate it.

1100
00:44:43,340 --> 00:44:45,260
And I would just leave it.

1101
00:44:45,260 --> 00:44:45,760
You would just say.

1102
00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:46,380
But that's because.

1103
00:44:46,380 --> 00:44:50,260
I would bring up peanut butter chicken in conversation like you guys have known about it.

1104
00:44:50,260 --> 00:44:58,780
I'm such a good anecdote teller and such an amazing storyteller that I wouldn't want to ruin it, ruin my own story by learning that it was normal chicken or something.

1105
00:44:58,780 --> 00:44:59,740
You would just make it up.

1106
00:44:59,740 --> 00:45:03,220
I would just want to see it and then tell you guys that I saw it.

1107
00:45:03,220 --> 00:45:04,220
I would come in here.

1108
00:45:04,220 --> 00:45:05,220
I would have peanut butter chicken.

1109
00:45:05,220 --> 00:45:06,060
That's a good mark of a good storyteller.

1110
00:45:06,060 --> 00:45:07,500
I would have peanut butter chicken.

1111
00:45:07,500 --> 00:45:09,300
I would say the name of it.

1112
00:45:09,420 --> 00:45:10,880
I would make the peanut butter chicken.

1113
00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:12,280
I would bring it in for us to eat.

1114
00:45:12,280 --> 00:45:13,340
I would say it.

1115
00:45:13,340 --> 00:45:15,360
I would say it while we're talking on here.

1116
00:45:15,360 --> 00:45:19,580
And I'd say, and, you know, I used peanut butter chicken and then you guys would go,

1117
00:45:19,580 --> 00:45:20,920
what? Yeah.

1118
00:45:20,920 --> 00:45:21,760
That's what I'd say.

1119
00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:23,620
There's no peanut butter chicken at the grocery store.

1120
00:45:23,620 --> 00:45:24,920
And then you show us a picture of it.

1121
00:45:24,920 --> 00:45:25,920
And it would be real.

1122
00:45:25,920 --> 00:45:28,560
And then you guys are so mad that it's real.

1123
00:45:28,560 --> 00:45:32,860
I think the couch is tearing us apart.

1124
00:45:32,860 --> 00:45:34,260
The couch is not tearing us apart.

1125
00:45:34,260 --> 00:45:35,960
It's making us very introspective.

1126
00:45:36,120 --> 00:45:40,480
The issue with the couch is just that you're in the middle, so you want to disagree.

1127
00:45:40,480 --> 00:45:41,140
Yeah.

1128
00:45:41,140 --> 00:45:43,200
You're so right.

1129
00:45:43,200 --> 00:45:45,080
Yeah, you're so fucking right.

1130
00:45:45,080 --> 00:45:47,080
Do we have a list we're supposed to be reading?

1131
00:45:47,080 --> 00:45:47,860
No.

1132
00:45:47,860 --> 00:45:49,320
No, this is a couch talk.

1133
00:45:49,320 --> 00:45:50,320
What are you talking about on a couch?

1134
00:45:50,320 --> 00:45:53,080
I thought that we were going to do a couch thing.

1135
00:45:53,080 --> 00:45:54,840
I thought we were reading a list of couches.

1136
00:45:54,840 --> 00:45:57,120
Oh, wait, I had something I wanted to read.

1137
00:45:57,120 --> 00:45:58,800
I had a poem I wanted to read.

1138
00:45:58,800 --> 00:45:59,880
Oh, is it about a couch?

1139
00:45:59,880 --> 00:46:00,480
Did you write it or did you find it?

1140
00:46:00,480 --> 00:46:01,080
I found it.

1141
00:46:01,080 --> 00:46:01,780
Oh.

1142
00:46:01,780 --> 00:46:05,680
I googled things to tell.

1143
00:46:05,800 --> 00:46:07,840
I googled things to talk about on a couch.

1144
00:46:07,840 --> 00:46:09,040
Look at how excited I am.

1145
00:46:09,040 --> 00:46:11,300
And for all for some reason,

1146
00:46:11,300 --> 00:46:12,640
all of the results were.

1147
00:46:12,640 --> 00:46:14,840
Is this a is this the dingler from Wayfair?

1148
00:46:14,840 --> 00:46:16,880
No, that's the one I have at home.

1149
00:46:16,880 --> 00:46:19,100
I have the dingler and it's terrible.

1150
00:46:19,100 --> 00:46:20,100
What the hell is that?

1151
00:46:20,100 --> 00:46:21,180
I hate my couch.

1152
00:46:21,180 --> 00:46:22,720
You just wanted to talk about your couch.

1153
00:46:22,720 --> 00:46:25,440
Let me just say this while we're on the topic of couches.

1154
00:46:25,440 --> 00:46:26,720
I hate my couch.

1155
00:46:26,720 --> 00:46:29,940
If anyone wants to give me a couch for free

1156
00:46:29,940 --> 00:46:32,660
and deliver it to my house, I will hang out with you.

1157
00:46:32,660 --> 00:46:34,400
My couch is S tier.

1158
00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:36,080
I will hang out with you weirdo.

1159
00:46:36,080 --> 00:46:37,980
Did you want to get my couch at my house?

1160
00:46:37,980 --> 00:46:39,440
It's kind of hurting my back.

1161
00:46:39,440 --> 00:46:41,360
Really? Yeah. In what way?

1162
00:46:41,360 --> 00:46:44,980
I think it's just because I'm maybe sit, move your butt back and sit up more.

1163
00:46:44,980 --> 00:46:47,820
This hurts me.

1164
00:46:47,820 --> 00:46:49,660
Be careful with the C4.

1165
00:46:49,660 --> 00:46:50,660
It's empty.

1166
00:46:50,660 --> 00:46:53,620
OK, I was going to say you're about to spill that all over the laptop.

1167
00:46:53,620 --> 00:46:54,820
But now I look weird.

1168
00:46:54,820 --> 00:46:55,580
You don't look weird.

1169
00:46:55,580 --> 00:46:57,380
I wanted to look more casual.

1170
00:46:57,380 --> 00:46:59,240
Look how casual I've looked the whole episode.

1171
00:46:59,240 --> 00:47:00,380
I've been completely casual.

1172
00:47:00,380 --> 00:47:02,040
You guys got the sides. The middle is hard.

1173
00:47:02,040 --> 00:47:02,680
Look at this.

1174
00:47:03,620 --> 00:47:08,620
I have to crane my neck. I know that's my issue is that I have to look at both of you.

1175
00:47:08,620 --> 00:47:10,120
Look at me. Look at how casual I am.

1176
00:47:10,120 --> 00:47:14,620
So I googled things to talk about on the couch because I knew we were going to do a couch episode.

1177
00:47:14,620 --> 00:47:15,120
Okay.

1178
00:47:15,120 --> 00:47:19,620
And for some reason most of the results were things your couch would say if it could talk.

1179
00:47:19,620 --> 00:47:20,620
Most of them were?

1180
00:47:20,620 --> 00:47:24,120
There were like three or four in a row in the first like ten results that were that.

1181
00:47:24,120 --> 00:47:28,120
And one of them was this which is like it's a cartoon but it's a poem.

1182
00:47:28,120 --> 00:47:31,120
The cartoon doesn't really add much so I'll just read through what it says on it.

1183
00:47:31,120 --> 00:47:31,620
Okay.

1184
00:47:31,620 --> 00:47:33,320
and it's called if your couch could talk.

1185
00:47:33,320 --> 00:47:35,220
And this is what it says.

1186
00:47:35,220 --> 00:47:36,920
I don't have arms and legs.

1187
00:47:36,920 --> 00:47:38,320
I don't this is before the poem part.

1188
00:47:38,320 --> 00:47:39,220
This is just the intro.

1189
00:47:39,220 --> 00:47:40,620
I don't have arms or legs.

1190
00:47:40,620 --> 00:47:41,620
I cannot speak.

1191
00:47:41,620 --> 00:47:44,520
I have no name, but I am at the center of their lives.

1192
00:47:44,520 --> 00:47:47,800
I've seen Jake develop every step of the way been there day

1193
00:47:47,800 --> 00:47:51,200
to day and as ever I'll still be here for the next chapter of

1194
00:47:51,200 --> 00:47:53,420
his life, which one of us do you think is Jake?

1195
00:47:53,420 --> 00:47:56,720
Whichever one of us is a baby that grows up into an adult.

1196
00:47:56,720 --> 00:47:58,220
I think a couch does have arms.

1197
00:47:58,220 --> 00:47:59,520
It does.

1198
00:47:59,520 --> 00:48:00,520
Yeah.

1199
00:48:01,020 --> 00:48:05,320
and the hands and legs. Depends on the couch, I guess. I have arms and legs,

1200
00:48:05,320 --> 00:48:10,540
but I cannot speak. I have a name and it's couch.

1201
00:48:10,540 --> 00:48:14,180
Here's the poem, and this goes throughout Jake's life. Okay.

1202
00:48:14,180 --> 00:48:18,380
I'll be here as the carrier of his toys and milk spillage.

1203
00:48:18,380 --> 00:48:22,220
I'll be here as the foundation of his first pillow village.

1204
00:48:22,220 --> 00:48:25,180
I'll be here as the helping hand during his first steps.

1205
00:48:25,180 --> 00:48:28,700
I'll be here as the desk when he studies for tough tests.

1206
00:48:29,220 --> 00:48:31,920
I'll be here as the banker when his wallet goes amiss.

1207
00:48:31,920 --> 00:48:36,620
I'll be here as the wingman during his first kiss.

1208
00:48:36,620 --> 00:48:40,220
I'll be here as the comfort when he begins a profession.

1209
00:48:40,220 --> 00:48:43,920
I'll be here as the witness for each career progression.

1210
00:48:43,920 --> 00:48:48,200
I'll be here as the peace from home when he moves on and I'll

1211
00:48:48,200 --> 00:48:51,420
be here as the storyteller every dusk till dawn.

1212
00:48:51,420 --> 00:48:54,620
I mean and that's over the course of 30 years.

1213
00:48:54,620 --> 00:48:55,520
Yeah, that depends.

1214
00:48:55,520 --> 00:48:56,420
Who has a couch that long?

1215
00:48:56,420 --> 00:48:58,620
Yeah, I mean unless you're getting like a really good.

1216
00:48:58,820 --> 00:49:02,820
So you see here he's six months old and he has the same couch all the way until he's

1217
00:49:02,820 --> 00:49:07,220
30. Well at this point he's not there but he's been trapped inside of a photograph above

1218
00:49:07,220 --> 00:49:12,420
the couch with his family. I'm seeing it. So that's just a fun interesting photo I thought

1219
00:49:12,420 --> 00:49:17,020
that could start a conversation about a couch. Well I guess what would your couch say if

1220
00:49:17,020 --> 00:49:22,780
it could talk? My couch would say "ow" because Mo scratches it. Yeah. And people sit on it.

1221
00:49:22,780 --> 00:49:27,940
My couch would be like "I love when you sit on me and watch things. I like your butt on

1222
00:49:27,940 --> 00:49:32,940
I like your butt on me. I like everything you do on me. I'm on your couch and I like your butt on me.

1223
00:49:32,940 --> 00:49:38,940
Please use your computer more on me and go on your TV more and playstation on me. Put your thing in my cushion. Put your thing in my crack.

1224
00:49:38,940 --> 00:49:43,940
That's what the couch would say. The couch is a pervert. The couch is a perverted object.

1225
00:49:43,940 --> 00:49:48,940
My couch would be like, I'm so hungry you haven't fed me once the entire time you've had me. Please.

1226
00:49:48,940 --> 00:49:54,940
All you have fed me is M&M's. I feed my couch. My couch is eating good.

1227
00:49:54,940 --> 00:49:55,940
Yeah.

1228
00:49:55,940 --> 00:49:56,940
Riblet.

1229
00:49:56,940 --> 00:49:59,020
Don't say farts.

1230
00:49:59,020 --> 00:50:00,020
Not farts.

1231
00:50:00,020 --> 00:50:01,580
No, but I drop stuff in there all the time.

1232
00:50:01,580 --> 00:50:02,580
Yeah.

1233
00:50:02,580 --> 00:50:03,580
Okay.

1234
00:50:03,580 --> 00:50:04,580
Accidentally.

1235
00:50:04,580 --> 00:50:06,060
What's the worst thing you've ever found in your couch?

1236
00:50:06,060 --> 00:50:07,060
Dust.

1237
00:50:07,060 --> 00:50:08,060
A headphone.

1238
00:50:08,060 --> 00:50:09,060
A nasty old headphone.

1239
00:50:09,060 --> 00:50:10,060
Yeah.

1240
00:50:10,060 --> 00:50:11,060
Yeah.

1241
00:50:11,060 --> 00:50:12,060
Bluetooth headphone.

1242
00:50:12,060 --> 00:50:13,060
Crumbs.

1243
00:50:13,060 --> 00:50:14,060
Yeah, I guess crumbs.

1244
00:50:14,060 --> 00:50:15,060
Dog hair.

1245
00:50:15,060 --> 00:50:16,060
Dude, I'm having this problem where there's so much dog hair in my house.

1246
00:50:16,060 --> 00:50:17,060
Every time I eat food, I just find dog hair.

1247
00:50:17,060 --> 00:50:18,060
I'm like, "Oh, I'm going to have to get rid of this."

1248
00:50:18,060 --> 00:50:19,060
I'm like, "I'm going to have to get rid of this."

1249
00:50:19,060 --> 00:50:20,060
I'm like, "I'm going to have to get rid of this."

1250
00:50:20,060 --> 00:50:21,060
I'm like, "I'm going to have to get rid of this."

1251
00:50:21,060 --> 00:50:22,660
There's so much dog hair in my house.

1252
00:50:22,660 --> 00:50:25,300
Every time I eat food, I just find dog hair,

1253
00:50:25,300 --> 00:50:26,500
and I stopped even taking it out.

1254
00:50:26,500 --> 00:50:27,340
I just eat it.

1255
00:50:27,340 --> 00:50:28,600
- Yeah, you just eat it.

1256
00:50:28,600 --> 00:50:29,440
That's fine.

1257
00:50:29,440 --> 00:50:30,280
It's got protein in it.

1258
00:50:30,280 --> 00:50:31,660
(laughing)

1259
00:50:31,660 --> 00:50:32,660
- I just eat the dog hair.

1260
00:50:32,660 --> 00:50:33,500
- We didn't have--

1261
00:50:33,500 --> 00:50:35,380
- There's too many of them in the food.

1262
00:50:35,380 --> 00:50:37,260
- You can eat dog hair.

1263
00:50:37,260 --> 00:50:38,100
- Yeah.

1264
00:50:38,100 --> 00:50:40,180
- That's, if somebody, are you guys weird about

1265
00:50:40,180 --> 00:50:41,860
if there's a hair at your food in a restaurant?

1266
00:50:41,860 --> 00:50:42,700
- No, I don't care.

1267
00:50:42,700 --> 00:50:43,540
- I don't care at all.

1268
00:50:43,540 --> 00:50:44,360
- It depends.

1269
00:50:44,360 --> 00:50:45,200
- It doesn't matter.

1270
00:50:45,200 --> 00:50:47,860
- It depends where the restaurant is.

1271
00:50:47,860 --> 00:50:50,660
If there's like a hair in my food at McDonald's,

1272
00:50:50,660 --> 00:50:54,580
whatever. But if there's like a like a hair at like a nice place, I'm like,

1273
00:50:54,580 --> 00:50:58,700
why will you tell me? But what they proved is just maybe I could get this

1274
00:50:58,700 --> 00:51:03,100
meal for free. Maybe I can be an asshole. Then you're a fucking Karen, mate.

1275
00:51:03,100 --> 00:51:08,740
That's a complete Karen. I am a Karen. Real men just eat hair. Yeah,

1276
00:51:08,740 --> 00:51:12,700
just eat it, bro. Yeah. How many? If you're in a loving relationship,

1277
00:51:12,700 --> 00:51:16,500
how many opportunities will you have to eat another person's hair? Exactly.

1278
00:51:16,500 --> 00:51:20,180
You know what? I'm rethinking my whole this is this is cheated. You can cheat.

1279
00:51:20,180 --> 00:51:23,980
That's cheating. Eating your waitress's hair is cheating.

1280
00:51:23,980 --> 00:51:25,880
But nobody's getting mad at you.

1281
00:51:25,880 --> 00:51:29,780
It's just a free... In fact, you have the opportunity to get mad at the other

1282
00:51:29,780 --> 00:51:33,680
person. By the way, you can still eat the hair. Say, "I ate your fucking hair."

1283
00:51:33,680 --> 00:51:33,980
Yeah.

1284
00:51:33,980 --> 00:51:36,880
I'm coughing. Pardon me?

1285
00:51:36,880 --> 00:51:41,180
Can you call the chef out here? "Hey, buddy, I ate your fucking hair."

1286
00:51:41,180 --> 00:51:42,780
"Hey, do you recognize this head of hair?"

1287
00:51:42,780 --> 00:51:47,880
Yeah, you put the hair in the food and I fucking ate it. What did you

1288
00:51:47,880 --> 00:51:49,880
suspect. Gulping the hair.

1289
00:51:49,880 --> 00:51:51,880
Good for you, I ate your hair.

1290
00:51:51,880 --> 00:51:53,880
Hey, notice anything about...

1291
00:51:53,880 --> 00:51:55,880
Notice anything about my plate?

1292
00:51:55,880 --> 00:51:57,880
Uh, no sir. Well, there's no

1293
00:51:57,880 --> 00:51:59,880
hair in it. You know why? Cause I ate

1294
00:51:59,880 --> 00:52:01,880
the fucking hair out of it.

1295
00:52:01,880 --> 00:52:03,880
Now I'm gonna grow a

1296
00:52:03,880 --> 00:52:05,880
mini you in my belly. I'm gonna grow

1297
00:52:05,880 --> 00:52:07,880
a watermelon in my belly.

1298
00:52:07,880 --> 00:52:09,880
That still scares me. Your hair is

1299
00:52:09,880 --> 00:52:11,880
seeds. Hair is seeds

1300
00:52:11,880 --> 00:52:13,880
for humans. Why are white

1301
00:52:13,880 --> 00:52:15,880
seeds okay to eat, but the

1302
00:52:15,880 --> 00:52:17,880
black ones will make a watermelon in your body.

1303
00:52:17,880 --> 00:52:21,880
It's due to the blackness of the seed

1304
00:52:21,880 --> 00:52:23,880
is like, because it's heavier, like a black hole.

1305
00:52:23,880 --> 00:52:25,880
Interesting.

1306
00:52:25,880 --> 00:52:26,880
Wow.

1307
00:52:26,880 --> 00:52:28,880
But, and then the biggest seed of all, the peach.

1308
00:52:28,880 --> 00:52:30,880
Yes.

1309
00:52:30,880 --> 00:52:31,880
You can't eat that.

1310
00:52:31,880 --> 00:52:32,880
You can't eat that because it's full of arsenic.

1311
00:52:32,880 --> 00:52:33,880
You can eat that.

1312
00:52:33,880 --> 00:52:35,880
Is there a white hole?

1313
00:52:35,880 --> 00:52:36,880
A white hole?

1314
00:52:36,880 --> 00:52:37,880
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1315
00:52:37,880 --> 00:52:38,880
What is a white hole?

1316
00:52:38,880 --> 00:52:40,880
It's in space.

1317
00:52:40,880 --> 00:52:43,880
I figured this much, but what else about it?

1318
00:52:43,880 --> 00:52:51,080
I said yes immediately, but I don't know if it was in if it's real or in a book

1319
00:52:51,080 --> 00:52:55,480
about wizards. I read it. Yeah, just one of those things that you're like, well,

1320
00:52:55,480 --> 00:52:57,880
it's got to exist. Yin and Yang.

1321
00:52:57,880 --> 00:52:59,980
I definitely wasn't a white hole.

1322
00:52:59,980 --> 00:53:01,080
They just call it a hole.

1323
00:53:01,080 --> 00:53:07,280
It would just be would be a hole.

1324
00:53:07,280 --> 00:53:10,180
A white hole is a it's hypothetical.

1325
00:53:10,180 --> 00:53:12,680
Oh great back to hypotheticals.

1326
00:53:13,080 --> 00:53:17,080
people also hypothetically there's also the rainbow hole and the while in

1327
00:53:17,080 --> 00:53:22,380
general relativity as agnostic about the reality of white holes thermodynamics

1328
00:53:22,380 --> 00:53:24,780
gives the concept a hard no.

1329
00:53:24,780 --> 00:53:29,180
So a red hole couldn't exist. Hey, I saw a red hole

1330
00:53:29,180 --> 00:53:30,580
goatee

1331
00:53:30,580 --> 00:53:35,980
on the computer and the library. Come on, bring it up.

1332
00:53:35,980 --> 00:53:37,580
Bring it up.

1333
00:53:37,580 --> 00:53:38,880
Thank you.

1334
00:53:38,880 --> 00:53:40,080
Thank you.

1335
00:53:40,080 --> 00:53:42,680
I thought that was fine.

1336
00:53:42,680 --> 00:53:47,680
It was fine. I thought that was fine. You shouldn't be striving for fine. You should be striving

1337
00:53:47,680 --> 00:53:57,540
for striving for great. Standing. Great. Greatness. It is trying to be greatness. I think it was

1338
00:53:57,540 --> 00:54:01,720
actually great. You think that was great? No, it was not great. You should have said

1339
00:54:01,720 --> 00:54:06,280
white hole was goatee. That would have been white hole is goats. No, because the hole is

1340
00:54:06,280 --> 00:54:10,960
red. He's he's white. Pull it up on the TV. Pull it up on the TV. You can't pull it. There's

1341
00:54:10,960 --> 00:54:17,000
there's no TV app that has goats. What do you mean Roku Roku is it's not a device

1342
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:21,960
screen saver. You could do that. I guess if you were at a Best Buy and you were

1343
00:54:21,960 --> 00:54:28,640
really funny. Yeah. Oh, I just thought of just to just a guy down the back. We

1344
00:54:28,640 --> 00:54:31,920
talked about this a while ago. If there was a painting, I could jump into Roku

1345
00:54:31,920 --> 00:54:37,920
City. Yeah, the original, the original painting of it that they developed Roku

1346
00:54:37,920 --> 00:54:40,500
city that was painted in the 1700s.

1347
00:54:40,500 --> 00:54:42,900
Roku City has too much shit going on.

1348
00:54:42,900 --> 00:54:43,400
Yeah.

1349
00:54:43,400 --> 00:54:45,900
That's why you don't want to deal with Godzilla and Borat.

1350
00:54:45,900 --> 00:54:48,900
Because I'm not sure I'm going to be able to come out of the painting after I go into it.

1351
00:54:48,900 --> 00:54:49,400
Yeah.

1352
00:54:49,400 --> 00:54:52,400
And Roku City is a whole ass city.

1353
00:54:52,400 --> 00:54:54,900
It's a city of movies and film that Cameron loves.

1354
00:54:54,900 --> 00:54:55,900
McDonald's is there.

1355
00:54:55,900 --> 00:54:57,900
They have McDonald's in Roku City.

1356
00:54:57,900 --> 00:54:58,400
Oh, really?

1357
00:54:58,400 --> 00:54:58,900
Yeah.

1358
00:54:58,900 --> 00:54:59,400
Did they pay for that?

1359
00:54:59,400 --> 00:55:01,400
Someone hasn't been spending time looking at Roku City.

1360
00:55:01,400 --> 00:55:02,400
I did change it.

1361
00:55:02,400 --> 00:55:02,900
I don't have a retro.

1362
00:55:02,900 --> 00:55:03,400
I changed my...

1363
00:55:03,400 --> 00:55:05,900
I look at Amazon Fire Stick TV City.

1364
00:55:05,900 --> 00:55:06,900
We have our own city actually.

1365
00:55:06,900 --> 00:55:07,400
No, we don't.

1366
00:55:07,400 --> 00:55:09,400
Yeah, you have Jason Bateman's picture.

1367
00:55:09,400 --> 00:55:11,400
We actually do.

1368
00:55:11,400 --> 00:55:15,400
This is literally Philadelphia vibes right now.

1369
00:55:15,400 --> 00:55:17,400
Philadelphia vibes? What do you mean by that?

1370
00:55:17,400 --> 00:55:21,400
What does that mean? I don't know.

1371
00:55:21,400 --> 00:55:23,400
Just like a worse city?

1372
00:55:23,400 --> 00:55:30,400
There are so many different Roku screensavers that everyone gets hung up on Roku City.

1373
00:55:30,400 --> 00:55:32,400
Buddy, they got the jungle.

1374
00:55:32,400 --> 00:55:34,400
They got the wild west.

1375
00:55:34,400 --> 00:55:41,400
Wild West. They got romantic. What does that mean? Once we're done with this episode, I'm

1376
00:55:41,400 --> 00:55:48,780
going to show you all of the Roku. It's just people in love. In a city. It's pretty much

1377
00:55:48,780 --> 00:55:56,840
always a city, but there are different biomes and boroughs of Roku. If New York City had

1378
00:55:56,840 --> 00:56:03,840
a jungle borough, a sand borough, a desert borough, an arctic borough, a desert borough,

1379
00:56:03,840 --> 00:56:04,840
Dick Burrow

1380
00:56:04,840 --> 00:56:05,840
Biome Minecraft

1381
00:56:05,840 --> 00:56:06,840
This would be way better

1382
00:56:06,840 --> 00:56:07,840
Minecraft Biome

1383
00:56:07,840 --> 00:56:08,840
This would be a way fucking better place

1384
00:56:08,840 --> 00:56:09,840
Oh yeah

1385
00:56:09,840 --> 00:56:10,840
Yeah

1386
00:56:10,840 --> 00:56:14,740
There has to be some place on earth where all of the different biomes meet

1387
00:56:14,740 --> 00:56:18,940
They have, every place they have like that, they have all, all they have, the cities where

1388
00:56:18,940 --> 00:56:21,940
states meet, you know, they have Texarkana

1389
00:56:21,940 --> 00:56:22,940
Yeah

1390
00:56:22,940 --> 00:56:23,940
They got the four corners

1391
00:56:23,940 --> 00:56:24,940
Yep

1392
00:56:24,940 --> 00:56:25,940
Yeah

1393
00:56:25,940 --> 00:56:27,160
All that stuff, they waste it all on a place where it's the same on every side

1394
00:56:27,160 --> 00:56:28,160
Where is the four corners?

1395
00:56:28,160 --> 00:56:29,160
That's what I'm saying

1396
00:56:29,160 --> 00:56:30,160
It's between four states

1397
00:56:30,160 --> 00:56:31,160
What's four states?

1398
00:56:31,160 --> 00:56:32,160
It's like

1399
00:56:32,160 --> 00:56:33,160
Is one of them Utah?

1400
00:56:33,160 --> 00:56:40,840
Utah, Nevada, New Mexico, Colorado? No? I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. It's

1401
00:56:40,840 --> 00:56:45,960
four of the five of Utah, Nevada, Colorado, New Mexico, and Arizona. It's four of those.

1402
00:56:45,960 --> 00:56:53,200
Yeah. And I don't know which four. And they should build a city there. They tried. Corner

1403
00:56:53,200 --> 00:56:58,760
City. Yeah. It was called Corner City. They tried to make it. The problem was you got four

1404
00:56:58,760 --> 00:57:07,160
states. Heavy Mormon populations, four times the taxes, four times the taxes, heavy Mormon

1405
00:57:07,160 --> 00:57:12,360
population so no bars are getting made. I'd probably jump into the Mona Lisa and then I'd

1406
00:57:12,360 --> 00:57:19,080
jump into the Mona Lisa. And then I'd motorboat it. I'd jump into the Mona Lisa and motorboat.

1407
00:57:19,080 --> 00:57:23,280
No I wouldn't do that. No. But I mean I would maybe jump into the Mona Lisa. I guess you

1408
00:57:23,280 --> 00:57:27,080
I just got to say one of the paintings from Mario sixty four yeah,

1409
00:57:27,080 --> 00:57:32,480
but I jump in a bomb on world battlefield. Is it the very least I

1410
00:57:32,480 --> 00:57:34,120
could collect stars in there? Yeah,

1411
00:57:34,120 --> 00:57:38,880
stuff to do there. I know that yeah for like Mona Lisa, that might just be

1412
00:57:38,880 --> 00:57:42,920
it. That's that is it. It might just be one bitch. Who is she in front of

1413
00:57:42,920 --> 00:57:45,680
this strange white bald guy who's appeared behind Mona Lisa

1414
00:57:45,680 --> 00:57:50,360
where they would not be saying I was strange. They say that it would

1415
00:57:50,400 --> 00:57:51,940
literally stop being called the Mona Lisa.

1416
00:57:51,940 --> 00:57:53,140
It would start being called.

1417
00:57:53,140 --> 00:57:55,300
There's a speech bubble from you in the background that says,

1418
00:57:55,300 --> 00:57:57,100
"I thought I could go in a different place.

1419
00:57:57,100 --> 00:57:59,800
I thought there would be more in here."

1420
00:57:59,800 --> 00:58:02,000
You can't get past the frame.

1421
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:04,000
And then it becomes an even more important painting

1422
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:06,300
because it's the first time that somebody's done a speech bubble.

1423
00:58:06,300 --> 00:58:06,840
Yeah.

1424
00:58:06,840 --> 00:58:07,500
Is there...

1425
00:58:07,500 --> 00:58:12,100
Am I misremembering the Mona Lisa, but is there a river behind her?

1426
00:58:12,100 --> 00:58:13,540
Does she have a slight smile?

1427
00:58:13,540 --> 00:58:15,100
She has no smile.

1428
00:58:15,100 --> 00:58:16,240
I don't know if there's a river.

1429
00:58:16,240 --> 00:58:17,600
There's some kind of landscape behind her.

1430
00:58:17,600 --> 00:58:19,000
Yeah, there is a landscape.

1431
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:19,400
Yeah.

1432
00:58:19,740 --> 00:58:23,420
never really understood why that one popped off so hard because it was the

1433
00:58:23,420 --> 00:58:27,380
first time that there was ever a painted woman back then. It was not,

1434
00:58:27,380 --> 00:58:32,780
everything looked like balloon animals and tomato soup cans.

1435
00:58:32,780 --> 00:58:39,700
They didn't quite figure out how to realistically paint a subject quite yet.

1436
00:58:39,700 --> 00:58:44,700
But didn't they discover the Mona Lisa only like two years ago or something?

1437
00:58:44,700 --> 00:58:48,020
Yeah. And at some museum or I did at least.

1438
00:58:48,020 --> 00:58:50,020
(laughter)

1439
00:58:50,020 --> 00:58:53,020
I discovered it actually while watching Pink Panther, I think.

1440
00:58:53,020 --> 00:58:55,020
(laughter)

1441
00:58:55,020 --> 00:58:59,020
I think that they didn't discover it, they knew about his other paintings for a long time.

1442
00:58:59,020 --> 00:59:01,020
He drew that guy with all the arms.

1443
00:59:01,020 --> 00:59:03,020
He drew tons of shit, man. This guy was a genius.

1444
00:59:03,020 --> 00:59:08,020
He also made, he was the guy that first thought of the airplane.

1445
00:59:08,020 --> 00:59:11,020
Which guy did Mona Lisa? Was that Mr. Lisa?

1446
00:59:11,020 --> 00:59:13,020
That was Mark Lisa, yeah.

1447
00:59:13,020 --> 00:59:15,020
Are you guys stupid?

1448
00:59:15,020 --> 00:59:17,020
Literally Leonardo da Vinci.

1449
00:59:17,020 --> 00:59:20,980
Really? Yes. I think I knew that. He wasn't a painter though. He was an

1450
00:59:20,980 --> 00:59:24,340
inventor and he went into pregnant woman's bodies in an adventure. He

1451
00:59:24,340 --> 00:59:24,940
shrank down.

1452
00:59:24,940 --> 00:59:29,940
That's why that movie... Not only was he a painter, or not only was he an

1453
00:59:29,940 --> 00:59:33,540
inventor. That's why that movie Shrinking Da Vinci is existing, is exists.

1454
00:59:33,540 --> 00:59:37,260
I don't know what that is. Shrinking Da Vinci? I've never heard of it. He

1455
00:59:37,260 --> 00:59:41,340
shrinks... Cameron just explained it. He shrinks down and sneaks into pregnant

1456
00:59:41,340 --> 00:59:46,460
woman's bodies and he... What? You haven't seen this movie? Is it a movie?

1457
00:59:46,940 --> 00:59:48,940
You've never seen shrinking Da Vinci?

1458
00:59:48,940 --> 00:59:50,440
What is the purpose of having the...

1459
00:59:50,440 --> 00:59:52,340
He's a scientist, he does experiments.

1460
00:59:52,340 --> 00:59:57,240
Yeah, he tried to invent a plane back in whatever 1430, flying machine.

1461
00:59:57,240 --> 00:59:58,940
Actually, a heliotrope.

1462
00:59:58,940 --> 01:00:03,340
But then he accidentally invented a shrink ray that only let him into pregnant women's bodies.

1463
01:00:03,340 --> 01:00:05,640
It would actually make a lot of sense if...

1464
01:00:05,640 --> 01:00:08,340
Because Da Vinci, the whole thing is like, oh, did he...

1465
01:00:08,340 --> 01:00:11,340
It's like the Shakespeare thing, it's like, did he exist or was he...

1466
01:00:11,340 --> 01:00:12,940
Nobody knew him.

1467
01:00:12,940 --> 01:00:15,640
But what if it was because he was really, really small?

1468
01:00:15,640 --> 01:00:17,980
He was really small and he shrunk himself with a ray.

1469
01:00:17,980 --> 01:00:21,840
But he was getting all up in pregnant women's dead bodies.

1470
01:00:21,840 --> 01:00:22,680
I don't know about that.

1471
01:00:22,680 --> 01:00:25,040
Their dead bodies, yeah, that's the problem.

1472
01:00:25,040 --> 01:00:26,740
Are you for real?

1473
01:00:26,740 --> 01:00:27,340
Yeah.

1474
01:00:27,340 --> 01:00:29,640
This is an actual truth that you learned on the History Channel?

1475
01:00:29,640 --> 01:00:32,940
This again might be, well again, this might be, well, first of all, nowadays,

1476
01:00:32,940 --> 01:00:34,540
you're watching the History Channel.

1477
01:00:34,540 --> 01:00:35,640
Yeah.

1478
01:00:35,640 --> 01:00:38,440
It's not going to be telling you, you're not going to be learning about Leonardo

1479
01:00:38,440 --> 01:00:41,040
da Vinci, you're going to be learning about ghosts and paranormal UFOs,

1480
01:00:41,040 --> 01:00:45,540
which I know from watching it a lot recently, which they have no history on

1481
01:00:45,540 --> 01:00:48,040
there at all, but you watch it at four in the morning. I think that this might be

1482
01:00:48,040 --> 01:00:50,840
something that's... No, I watch it at completely in the middle of the day.

1483
01:00:50,840 --> 01:00:53,300
They don't ever... No, no, shrinking Da Vinci is on at four in the morning. I'm

1484
01:00:53,300 --> 01:00:58,240
thinking of the Travel Channel, which is also only ghosts now. Yeah. But I think

1485
01:00:58,240 --> 01:00:59,980
Leonardo Da Vinci was...

1486
01:00:59,980 --> 01:01:06,500
I think he was... That was one controversy among... With him, is that he

1487
01:01:06,500 --> 01:01:10,380
was always going into pregnant women's bodies. Why do you keep saying going

1488
01:01:10,460 --> 01:01:14,660
into. I don't want to say anything gory or nasty.

1489
01:01:14,660 --> 01:01:19,220
Yeah, it's all it's all alleged and he doesn't want to. Well, I could. I think it

1490
01:01:19,220 --> 01:01:23,300
was true. Well, you have to say allegedly because as people. Well, you don't have

1491
01:01:23,300 --> 01:01:26,780
to. It's been a long time as a state, though he has left the world. He doesn't

1492
01:01:26,780 --> 01:01:30,820
have an estate anymore. He hasn't. Oh, he has an estate, buddy. But is this true

1493
01:01:30,820 --> 01:01:37,300
that he was completely acting up or acting? What he was doing was maybe OK in

1494
01:01:37,300 --> 01:01:42,100
terms of science but not so great by today's terms of what's okay to do to a pregnant woman's

1495
01:01:42,100 --> 01:01:48,380
body. There's one thing that's okay to do to a pregnant woman's body. Deliver the child.

1496
01:01:48,380 --> 01:01:53,900
You don't think they have sex? Fuck no! No, you can't have sex if you're pregnant. Fuck

1497
01:01:53,900 --> 01:01:59,860
the baby up there, you fucking scramble the baby. Oh okay. Mr. Big Dick. Mr. Big Dick going

1498
01:01:59,860 --> 01:02:05,100
all the way up. I'd probably fucking kill the baby with my huge fucking car. Yeah, the

1499
01:02:05,100 --> 01:02:07,900
The baby's gonna come out with like a split head.

1500
01:02:07,900 --> 01:02:11,600
Let me tell you, you can't do that.

1501
01:02:11,600 --> 01:02:14,300
You can't do that.

1502
01:02:14,300 --> 01:02:17,800
Not even if my dick is small enough that it's not getting

1503
01:02:17,800 --> 01:02:20,900
anywhere near. If your dick is so small that you only, you

1504
01:02:20,900 --> 01:02:23,700
only are, you barely, you don't penetrate, you just are in

1505
01:02:23,700 --> 01:02:24,800
like the labia area.

1506
01:02:24,800 --> 01:02:27,400
If it's just kind of like a head, you have a dick in it.

1507
01:02:27,400 --> 01:02:28,500
Okay.

1508
01:02:28,500 --> 01:02:28,900
Yeah.

1509
01:02:28,900 --> 01:02:29,500
All right.

1510
01:02:29,500 --> 01:02:31,100
That's, I mean, we should have known.

1511
01:02:31,100 --> 01:02:33,600
That's what shrinking Da Vinci is kind of all about.

1512
01:02:33,600 --> 01:02:36,200
So he can shrink his penis small enough that it's okay to have sex with a

1513
01:02:36,200 --> 01:02:37,500
pregnant woman? I think he was dissecting people, though.

1514
01:02:37,500 --> 01:02:40,620
Was he actually dissecting pregnant women? That's what people did forever.

1515
01:02:40,620 --> 01:02:43,860
That's how he made his famous drawing of the circular man.

1516
01:02:43,860 --> 01:02:48,040
Oh. The Latruvian man. Yeah. That makes sense. That's what the circle was

1517
01:02:48,040 --> 01:02:50,700
from a pregnant woman's stomach. That's how he was able to develop that shape.

1518
01:02:50,700 --> 01:02:52,740
Yeah, he started with that. He was trying to develop that. He traced it.

1519
01:02:52,740 --> 01:02:57,460
Oh, okay. He had a... He put her on her belly and then, like,

1520
01:02:57,460 --> 01:03:02,160
drawing a hand. Yeah, and then he was in his laboratory or his workspace

1521
01:03:02,440 --> 01:03:04,780
or whatever and he was sweating. He's like, "Fuck, how am I going to get a

1522
01:03:04,780 --> 01:03:05,480
triangle?

1523
01:03:05,480 --> 01:03:09,580
How the fuck am I going to do the triangle?" I did this, the circle's

1524
01:03:09,580 --> 01:03:13,040
obvious, you just do a circle around the guy. And that's when his assistant

1525
01:03:13,040 --> 01:03:14,680
pinhead walked into the room.

1526
01:03:14,680 --> 01:03:21,600
His assistant Dracula smiled widely at him. "Need anything, boss?" "Oh, my

1527
01:03:21,600 --> 01:03:25,280
goodness." "Actually, yes. Would you come lay down on this paper table?"

1528
01:03:25,280 --> 01:03:26,800
His assistant Johnny Bravo.

1529
01:03:26,800 --> 01:03:29,040
(laughter)

1530
01:03:29,040 --> 01:03:35,040
- And that's how he invented a Dorito.

1531
01:03:35,040 --> 01:03:36,040
- Yeah.

1532
01:03:36,040 --> 01:03:37,840
Da Vinci, that's why they're called Doritos.

1533
01:03:37,840 --> 01:03:38,680
- Da Rito.

1534
01:03:38,680 --> 01:03:40,200
- Da Rito Da Vinci.

1535
01:03:40,200 --> 01:03:41,540
- Da Vinci Da Rito.

1536
01:03:41,540 --> 01:03:43,120
(laughter)

1537
01:03:43,120 --> 01:03:45,360
- This is my son, his name is Dorito Da Vinci.

1538
01:03:45,360 --> 01:03:47,080
(laughter)

1539
01:03:47,080 --> 01:03:49,040
- Dorito Da Vinci, that's a pretty good name.

1540
01:03:49,040 --> 01:03:49,880
That is a good name.

1541
01:03:49,880 --> 01:03:51,020
- I am Dorito Da Vinci.

1542
01:03:51,020 --> 01:03:54,000
- All right, the couch is, it's made me loose.

1543
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:55,440
Really made me relaxed, man.

1544
01:03:55,440 --> 01:03:57,440
I've been so calm this whole episode.

1545
01:03:57,440 --> 01:03:58,940
Usually I'm freaking the fuck out.

1546
01:03:58,940 --> 01:04:00,440
My heart rate has dropped.

1547
01:04:00,440 --> 01:04:00,940
Look at my hand.

1548
01:04:00,940 --> 01:04:04,940
All the way from its normal rate of 28 beats per minute down to 15.

1549
01:04:04,940 --> 01:04:06,440
Look at how still I am.

1550
01:04:06,440 --> 01:04:08,440
I have a really not still hand I think.

1551
01:04:08,440 --> 01:04:10,440
I could be doing surgery.

1552
01:04:10,440 --> 01:04:14,440
But I did just take pre-workout so I have tingly itches all over my entire body.

1553
01:04:14,440 --> 01:04:16,440
Oh yeah, that makes sense.

1554
01:04:16,440 --> 01:04:19,440
Your hand is not twitching.

1555
01:04:19,440 --> 01:04:20,440
Whoa.

1556
01:04:20,440 --> 01:04:22,440
I think my hand is moving.

1557
01:04:22,440 --> 01:04:24,440
Look at how my fingers look like.

1558
01:04:24,440 --> 01:04:26,940
Whoa! How do you do that?

1559
01:04:26,940 --> 01:04:28,940
I've known people who can do that in my life.

1560
01:04:28,940 --> 01:04:30,940
I've never known somebody, well I guess I did know somebody.

1561
01:04:30,940 --> 01:04:32,940
It's called skydiving fingers.

1562
01:04:32,940 --> 01:04:35,940
It does look like some skydiving fingers.

1563
01:04:35,940 --> 01:04:38,940
Look at that. Oh my god, that looks insane.

1564
01:04:38,940 --> 01:04:39,940
That looks incredible.

1565
01:04:39,940 --> 01:04:41,440
That does look crazy.

1566
01:04:41,440 --> 01:04:42,940
Alright, um.

1567
01:04:42,940 --> 01:04:43,940
Well I think that's it.

1568
01:04:43,940 --> 01:04:49,440
Go check out, I am going to be in Washington D.C. with

1569
01:04:49,440 --> 01:04:50,940
When are you in D.C.?

1570
01:04:50,940 --> 01:04:54,940
24th through the 26th opening for Mr. Freedland.

1571
01:04:54,940 --> 01:04:56,940
I think that's this weekend, right?

1572
01:04:56,940 --> 01:04:57,940
No.

1573
01:04:57,940 --> 01:04:58,940
No, next weekend.

1574
01:04:58,940 --> 01:05:07,820
And then I think the weekend after that, at the end of the month, the 28th through the

1575
01:05:07,820 --> 01:05:14,500
31st, I'm going to be in Pittsburgh and Baltimore opening for Girl God.

1576
01:05:14,500 --> 01:05:15,500
Grace and April.

1577
01:05:15,500 --> 01:05:19,780
Me and Patrick, always the openers, never the headlines.

1578
01:05:19,780 --> 01:05:20,860
We're never headlining.

1579
01:05:20,860 --> 01:05:25,420
We should do a back to back show where I do like five minutes.

1580
01:05:25,420 --> 01:05:30,660
Next month I'm going to be opening for Blink 182.

1581
01:05:30,660 --> 01:05:32,620
You're shitting me mate.

1582
01:05:32,620 --> 01:05:36,860
Doing spoken word punk rock.

1583
01:05:36,860 --> 01:05:39,340
Spoken word punk rock but you're just doing like slowed down.

1584
01:05:39,340 --> 01:05:40,340
Have you seen that video?

1585
01:05:40,340 --> 01:05:41,900
Spoken word with guitars and drums.

1586
01:05:41,900 --> 01:05:44,980
They already do spoken word punk rock.

1587
01:05:44,980 --> 01:05:46,740
It's called Adam's Song.

1588
01:05:46,740 --> 01:05:49,820
No it's called Mother's Day.

1589
01:05:49,820 --> 01:05:52,700
I was listening to that song this morning.

1590
01:05:52,700 --> 01:05:54,820
Mother's Day or Adam's song.

1591
01:05:54,820 --> 01:05:55,740
Adam's song. Yeah.

1592
01:05:55,740 --> 01:05:57,740
Remember Mother's Day?

1593
01:05:57,740 --> 01:05:59,540
That's a funny one.

1594
01:05:59,540 --> 01:06:01,700
I'll be sucking and fucking and touching, sucking and fucking.

1595
01:06:01,700 --> 01:06:02,500
And also there's

1596
01:06:02,500 --> 01:06:04,060
it's Mother's Day.

1597
01:06:04,060 --> 01:06:05,900
Or Blink 182.

1598
01:06:05,900 --> 01:06:09,620
Blink 182 did so many funny songs.

1599
01:06:09,620 --> 01:06:11,700
I want to fuck a dog in the ass.

1600
01:06:11,700 --> 01:06:13,260
That is some funny shit.

1601
01:06:13,260 --> 01:06:14,220
What's the other one?

1602
01:06:14,220 --> 01:06:15,500
There's the.

1603
01:06:15,500 --> 01:06:18,660
I think it's called Family Reunion.

1604
01:06:18,660 --> 01:06:19,780
Yeah, Family Reunion.

1605
01:06:19,780 --> 01:06:21,780
It's Christmas Eve and my grandpa just ate 65.

1606
01:06:21,780 --> 01:06:24,780
In that live album they do a version of "What's My Age Again?"

1607
01:06:24,780 --> 01:06:26,780
"Where's My Asian Friend?" he says there.

1608
01:06:26,780 --> 01:06:28,780
Dude, they were on top of the world.

1609
01:06:28,780 --> 01:06:35,780
My buddy Jake, I think I told you guys about this, but Jake's got a tattoo of Tom DeLonge from the Mark, Tom and Travis show.

1610
01:06:35,780 --> 01:06:37,780
Like the cartoon, like right there.

1611
01:06:37,780 --> 01:06:39,780
That is such a sick tattoo.

1612
01:06:39,780 --> 01:06:40,780
That is beast.

1613
01:06:40,780 --> 01:06:41,780
Alright.

1614
01:06:41,780 --> 01:06:42,780
Okay.

1615
01:06:42,780 --> 01:06:45,780
Well, we'll see ya, catch ya on the next couch.

1616
01:06:45,780 --> 01:06:48,780
I'll see you in Pittsburgh or Baltimore.

1617
01:06:48,780 --> 01:06:51,780
And Caleb will see you in our nation's capital.

1618
01:06:51,780 --> 01:06:53,780
Bye!

1619
01:06:53,780 --> 01:06:55,780
Richmond, north of Richmond.

1620
01:06:55,780 --> 01:07:03,780
Ice Spices being around for one year

1621
01:07:03,780 --> 01:07:05,780
is basically the blink of an eye, the flash in a pan.

1622
01:07:05,780 --> 01:07:06,780
Wow.

1623
01:07:06,780 --> 01:07:08,780
So that's when people say one hit wonder,

1624
01:07:08,780 --> 01:07:12,780
it's like, yeah, I wonder why.

1625
01:07:12,780 --> 01:07:14,780
I wonder if they're going to have another Big Bang.

1626
01:07:14,780 --> 01:07:17,280
Big Bang. Wow!

1627
01:07:17,280 --> 01:07:20,280
Yeah, because again, that's rocks and geology and dinosaurs.

1628
01:07:20,280 --> 01:07:22,280
Yeah, let me, that's if there was a science,

1629
01:07:22,280 --> 01:07:25,280
maybe the science equivalent of a youth pastor, he would be like,

1630
01:07:25,280 --> 01:07:27,780
"You guys are all obsessed with these one-hit wonders.

1631
01:07:27,780 --> 01:07:30,280
Let me tell you about the real one-hit wonder, the Big Bang."

1632
01:07:30,280 --> 01:07:30,780
Jesus Christ.

1633
01:07:30,780 --> 01:07:32,780
There is a science teacher, I think, is it?

1634
01:07:32,780 --> 01:07:34,280
Well, this would be more of a guy.

1635
01:07:34,280 --> 01:07:35,280
Middle school science teacher.

1636
01:07:35,280 --> 01:07:39,280
Yeah, but he was kind of exactly analogous to a youth pastor

1637
01:07:39,280 --> 01:07:42,780
in that he's at a science church and he's dressed up.

1638
01:07:42,780 --> 01:07:46,960
So what you're proposing is sitting on the chair backwards and you can imagine maybe

1639
01:07:46,960 --> 01:07:51,400
even just the way that every youth pastor looks in a meme or video.

1640
01:07:51,400 --> 01:07:56,200
So what you're proposing is a, I like this idea, a science church with a science youth

1641
01:07:56,200 --> 01:07:57,200
pastor.

1642
01:07:57,200 --> 01:07:58,200
Yeah.

1643
01:07:58,200 --> 01:08:01,320
And he does all the youth pastor joke meme stuff but it's for science.

1644
01:08:01,320 --> 01:08:03,320
Has everyone done that?

1645
01:08:03,320 --> 01:08:04,320
Wow.

1646
01:08:04,320 --> 01:08:09,880
Yeah but they don't have like, they don't have like science class like they have Sunday

1647
01:08:09,880 --> 01:08:10,880
school.

1648
01:08:10,880 --> 01:08:11,880
It's actually...

1649
01:08:11,880 --> 01:08:13,280
Let's do a quick check in on what's going on in everyone's week.

1650
01:08:13,280 --> 01:08:15,840
It'd be called SSS Science Sunday School.

1651
01:08:15,840 --> 01:08:16,840
It's less...

1652
01:08:16,840 --> 01:08:18,640
There's less danger that he would be able to...

1653
01:08:18,640 --> 01:08:19,640
Science Saturday.

1654
01:08:19,640 --> 01:08:20,640
Because they're not observing the painful Lord.

1655
01:08:20,640 --> 01:08:24,480
The youth science pastor wouldn't be molesting the kids because he has...

1656
01:08:24,480 --> 01:08:25,480
He'd be doing...

1657
01:08:25,480 --> 01:08:26,480
He'd be doing...

1658
01:08:26,480 --> 01:08:27,480
He'd be molesting him.

1659
01:08:27,480 --> 01:08:30,360
...an intimate knowledge of the human body and he knows how to pleasure himself.

1660
01:08:30,360 --> 01:08:31,360
That's right.

1661
01:08:31,360 --> 01:08:32,360
Without the help of another...

1662
01:08:32,360 --> 01:08:33,360
Maybe he would be doing...

1663
01:08:33,360 --> 01:08:34,360
Yeah.

1664
01:08:34,360 --> 01:08:35,360
Maybe he would be doing...

1665
01:08:35,360 --> 01:08:36,360
He would have a wife or a husband.

1666
01:08:36,360 --> 01:08:37,360
He could be touching and playing with the little frogs.

1667
01:08:37,360 --> 01:08:38,360
They're even smaller than a kid.

1668
01:08:38,360 --> 01:08:39,360
Or he's poly.

1669
01:08:39,360 --> 01:08:40,360
He feels even more power over...

1670
01:08:40,360 --> 01:08:44,260
weirder because it's maybe it's just like poly people are not

1671
01:08:44,260 --> 01:08:48,460
scientific. He would be instead of no less than the emotional.

1672
01:08:48,460 --> 01:08:51,460
They're not doing experiments on the kids.

1673
01:08:51,460 --> 01:08:56,060
He would be doing to experiments on twins psychologically.

1674
01:08:56,060 --> 01:08:59,260
Yeah, seeing and physically physically cutting them open

1675
01:08:59,260 --> 01:09:01,660
seeing if they have been joining them and joining them.

1676
01:09:01,660 --> 01:09:02,860
I'm joining them taking them apart.

1677
01:09:02,860 --> 01:09:03,360
Conjoining them apart.

1678
01:09:03,360 --> 01:09:04,260
Yeah, exactly.

1679
01:09:04,260 --> 01:09:05,160
Conjoining them.

1680
01:09:05,160 --> 01:09:05,960
Every combination.

1681
01:09:05,960 --> 01:09:08,660
Conjoining them at different parts of the body like the foot

1682
01:09:08,660 --> 01:09:11,020
or the ankle or the hand.

1683
01:09:11,020 --> 01:09:13,060
- If you were conjoined to your twin

1684
01:09:13,060 --> 01:09:14,560
at the bottoms of your feet.

1685
01:09:14,560 --> 01:09:16,900
(train horn)
