00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:14,800
Round two. Are you recording, Patrick?

00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:16,200
[music]

7
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:16,700
Yeah.

00:00:16,700 --> 00:00:17,900
[music]

9
00:00:17,900 --> 00:00:18,900
Round two.

[music]

11
00:00:20,300 --> 00:00:21,300
Trying again.

12
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:24,300
We had to stop. We tried to record this episode one time.

13
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:26,300
We got 20 minutes in and

14
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:27,500
And we got hacked.

15
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:28,800
No, Caleb's internet.

16
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:29,700
[music]

17
00:00:29,700 --> 00:00:30,200
Not true.

18
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:31,700
I was- I was- I was- I was-

19
00:00:31,700 --> 00:00:33,700
Caleb was gnawing on his ethernet cable.

20
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:34,200
Wrong.

21
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:35,700
What did you guys think of it?

22
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:37,700
I was a victim of a DDoS attack.

23
00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:39,700
Yeah, by your own- by your own

24
00:00:39,700 --> 00:00:41,700
rodent-like teeth chewing on your ethernet cable.

25
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:42,200
No, no.

26
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:44,200
You were a victim of a dad's-

27
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:46,200
dad's dick-awned sucking.

28
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:48,200
No, I was a victim of a- of a

29
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:50,200
DDoS attack from a, um,

30
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:52,200
from an un-

31
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:54,200
from an undisclosed-

32
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:56,200
I was a victim.

33
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:58,200
Yeah, a victim of being a rat and mouse

34
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:10,200
combined. No, no, no, that doesn't even make sense. You're crawling around a room on a horse. That's called a hamster and it's a very popular animal.

35
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:18,200
No, that's called a rouse. That's called Caleb the Rouse. It's not called Caleb the Rouse. Caleb the Rouse is not a, that's not a

36
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:25,200
cryptid. You crawl around under your bed, you chew on cables, you chew on cheeses that you find and you get stuck in traps. If I was a mouse,

37
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:27,640
I would simply buy cheese at the store,

38
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:29,640
eat that, and not bother anybody.

39
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:30,480
But so you know what you would do.

40
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:33,240
He would get kicked out of the store for being a mouse.

41
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:34,080
Yeah, you--

42
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:34,900
He'll kick you out of the store,

43
00:01:34,900 --> 00:01:36,320
nobody gets kicked out of the store.

44
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:38,720
You get kicked out of the store for being a mouse.

45
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:39,560
Yeah, yeah.

46
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:42,760
If ratatoing taught me anything.

47
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:44,360
It didn't, it didn't, clearly.

48
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:45,640
Have you seen Ratatoing?

49
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:46,520
No, I haven't.

50
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:47,560
I know of it, though.

51
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:49,160
It's on Amazon Prime.

52
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:50,940
I have seen it, but it didn't,

53
00:01:50,940 --> 00:01:53,840
I didn't relate to the mouse.

54
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:58,960
the rat and you thought you wept open no no you know you are all the characters

55
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:03,200
no Patrick Watson thought he's a it was a mirror no you watch yeah because you

56
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:06,320

57
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:11,040

64
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:41,640
crawl back into his mom back into your mom when you know went into their bed

65
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:45,200
Patrick saw Patrick saw Bill and Ted's excellent adventure and he said I want to

66
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:47,840
time travel so he crawled back into his mom's pussy.

67
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:48,840
No.

68
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:49,840
And his dad's penis.

69
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:50,840
Yeah, but you're a mouse and a rat combined.

70
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:56,720
And he fit better into his dad's penis because he's so small.

71
00:02:56,720 --> 00:03:01,040
You crawled back into your mom's pussy and you, whenever your dad's penis went in, you

72
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:02,040
went "whoop!"

73
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:03,040
And he fucked it.

74
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:04,040
Patrick is, Patrick is, Patrick is, scared you?

75
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:05,040
Patrick is one.

76
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:06,040
Whoop!

77
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:07,040
Whoop!

78
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:08,040
Latched on.

79
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:09,040
No.

80
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:13,040
Yeah, you hung on to it and your dad freaked out because he was like, "There's a little

81
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:14,040
mouse!

82
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:15,040
biting my peepee.

83
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:17,120
Patrick is one molecule big.

84
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:20,120
Patrick is one molecule big and his webcam is a microscope.

85
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:21,120
No.

86
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:22,120
It is.

87
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:23,120
Caleb is a Webkinz.

88
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:24,120
No.

89
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:25,120
Yeah.

90
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:26,120
You're a little penguin.

91
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:27,120
You have a little W in the code.

92
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:30,000
I'll fucking shoot myself in the head before they chip me.

93
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
You're a little penis.

94
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,560
Shoot yourself in the head because they already got you.

95
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:34,560
No, Webkinz have the mark of the beast in them.

96
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:35,560
They don't.

97
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:37,400
They just have a number that you use online.

98
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:40,560
The W stands for winning comma God.

99
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:42,360
They believe God wins.

100
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:43,360
No.

101
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:45,280
- It stands for winning Charlie Sheen.

102
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:47,920
- Were you guys, neither of you were raised

103
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:49,840
particularly religious, but were you ever,

104
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:52,440
it was the end of the world ever explained to you

105
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:54,280
as something that like-- - No.

106
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:55,600
- No? - No.

107
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:57,040
- That's like all anybody talked about

108
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:58,120
when I was growing up.

109
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:01,440
Everybody, do you guys know about the Left Behind movies?

110
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:03,120
- Yeah. - No.

111
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:06,360
- So there's this movie series for the fat guys

112
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:08,280
who don't know what I'm talking about in the room.

113
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:11,560
There's this movie series called Left Behind

114
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:14,100
and it's about the biblical tribulation,

115
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:16,800
which is a seven year period between

116
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:20,480
when the beginning of the apocalypse happens

117
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:22,760
and when God finally ends the world.

118
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:25,300
- Oh my God. - And it's basically,

119
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:26,740
it's awesome.

120
00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:28,840
It's about, 'cause Christians--

121
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:30,700
- You almost cut out again.

122
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:31,540
- No, I didn't.

123
00:04:31,540 --> 00:04:32,440
- Yeah, you did.

124
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:33,460
- I almost did, but I didn't. - That's why I said,

125
00:04:33,460 --> 00:04:35,000
"Oh my God."

126
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,760
- Oh, I thought you were just so scared.

127
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:38,760
- Oh my God. - Of the tribulation.

128
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:41,000
(laughing)

129
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:47,200
So I was taught growing up that what would one day I would just wake up and if I

130
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:51,320
didn't believe in God I would just like go downstairs and I would make breakfast

131
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:55,640
or whatever and then I would look around and my parents would just be gone.

132
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:59,480
There would just be piles of clothing. Yeah there would just be piles of clothing and I

133
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:04,720
would have to fight people yeah on this in the streets Mad Max style for

134
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:08,080
the next seven years until I finally get to die. Yeah. That's the other thing they

135
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:10,880
- I said nobody can die during the seven years.

136
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:11,720
- Oh, that's sick.

137
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:12,880
- You can't even kill yourself.

138
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:14,680
- Oh, you can just do whatever you want.

139
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:16,120
- That's true, everybody's a superhero,

140
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:16,960
but if everybody is, nobody is.

141
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:19,320
- So it's kinda like you are going to heaven.

142
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:21,000
- It's kinda like the Incredibles.

143
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,800
- Yeah, wait, wait, wait, let me get this straight.

144
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:25,360
I can't die and the parents are gone.

145
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:26,200
- Yeah.

146
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:28,120
- And I'm the one who's gonna be in hell?

147
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:30,160
I don't think so, buddy.

148
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:31,560
Sounds like paradise to me.

149
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:34,720
- And seven years, I mean, eternity's too long.

150
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:37,280
I would only, like, seven years of heaven?

151
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:39,020
- Seven, seven, - Sounds amazing.

152
00:05:39,020 --> 00:05:41,060
- Seven heaven.

153
00:05:41,060 --> 00:05:43,500
- Yeah, at the pedophile dad from the show.

154
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:44,920
- Yeah, seventh heaven.

155
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:46,840
Yeah, you tell me this.

156
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:47,960
- Have you ever watched that show?

157
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:48,960
- No. - I had no idea.

158
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:50,480
Like I knew that there was like,

159
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:53,080
obviously like the dad's a priest or whatever,

160
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:53,920
but like I--

161
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:55,120
- I don't know anything about that show.

162
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:56,480
I know the name.

163
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:59,100
- My cousin would babysit us and she would watch it,

164
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:00,280
so I had to watch it a bunch.

165
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:01,500
Like I watched that show.

166
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:04,480
I think I watched that show more than like SpongeBob

167
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:05,920
when I was like six.

168
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:06,960
- Damn, dude.

169
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:08,380
Yeah, I hated it.

170
00:06:08,380 --> 00:06:09,220
Yeah, sounds bad.

171
00:06:09,220 --> 00:06:10,740
But it's just, yeah, it's just like,

172
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:12,660
there's a whole episode where like,

173
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:14,760
the son, his name's like Simon,

174
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:18,080
and Simon like, becomes friends with these kids

175
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:19,540
who are huffing spray paint.

176
00:06:19,540 --> 00:06:22,040
Was it like the drug episode?

177
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:23,580
I miss the drug episodes.

178
00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:24,860
That was their drug episode.

It was fucking spray paint.

00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:29,340
Wait, we should do a drug episode.

182
00:06:29,340 --> 00:06:30,260

257
00:11:58,860 --> 00:12:04,980
last year because I was I remembered them like being like I was just like I was

258
00:12:04,980 --> 00:12:09,860
super disturbed by them as a kid I remember being like super gory and they

259
00:12:09,860 --> 00:12:12,980
weren't that gory but there was a bunch of stuff in there I was like oh man they

260
00:12:12,980 --> 00:12:16,100
shouldn't be selling these at like book fairs there's a bunch of scenes where

261
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:19,820
like people get their like intestines ripped out or they like you're like

262
00:12:19,820 --> 00:12:23,060
looking into the eyes of their friends while they're dying and like they're all

263
00:12:23,060 --> 00:12:28,100
like it's they're very violent they're not that's cool yeah man the fucking the

264
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:33,100
Tony Hawk autobiography I read as a kid was just called Tony Hawk professional

265
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:41,300
skateboarder. That's it. I mean what would you want it to be called?

266
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:46,900
What else would it be called? I don't know like the legend and adventure of Tony Hawk. The legend of the

267
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:54,260
Birdman. Tony Hawk's my struggle. Yeah. Yeah I mean that seems like a normal book name

268
00:12:54,260 --> 00:12:59,180
about someone to me yeah I mean it's I don't know like boards the Tony Hawk

269
00:12:59,180 --> 00:13:03,620
story I don't know is something like that like Tony hot like okay so there's

270
00:13:03,620 --> 00:13:14,100
another one called Tony Hawk occupation skateboarder that sounds like a like a

271
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:18,220
something Donald Rumsfeld has a file

272
00:13:18,220 --> 00:13:24,140
skateboarder Tony okay there's another one Tony how did I get here Tony Hawk

273
00:13:24,140 --> 00:13:34,920
the ascent of an unlikely CEO. How did I get here? He's just confused. Yeah. On the

274
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:39,900
halfpipe dot dot dot with Tony Hawk there's a good title. That is what that

275
00:13:39,900 --> 00:13:43,660
should have been the first one. Yeah how did I get here book is just a stream of

276
00:13:43,660 --> 00:13:47,580
consciousness of Tony Hawk writing like where am I what what what is this

277
00:13:47,580 --> 00:13:52,620
typewriter doing here? Yeah he writes on a typewriter. Well he woke up and he has

278
00:13:52,620 --> 00:13:59,300
tattoos on him that say "write a book" between board slides and burnout my notes

279
00:13:59,300 --> 00:14:04,100
from the road by Tony Hawk. Tony Hawk wakes up and he's covered in memento style tattoos

280
00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:12,020
that just say skateboard. It's all the trick names. I guess I'll do a 720. It says

281
00:14:12,020 --> 00:14:14,520
There's judo air on my wrist.

282
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:16,460
(laughing)

283
00:14:16,460 --> 00:14:18,420
Why does it say dog piss?

284
00:14:18,420 --> 00:14:21,000
Yeah.

285
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,860
I would always go to the Scholastic Book Fair

286
00:14:23,860 --> 00:14:26,220
and try and get the, they always had like a joke book

287
00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:27,060
or two.

288
00:14:27,060 --> 00:14:27,880
Oh yeah.

289
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:28,720
So I would always grab the joke books.

290
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:29,660
I used to get the joke books.

291
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:32,060
I would get the joke books and the cheat code books.

292
00:14:32,060 --> 00:14:34,020
My favorite thing about the joke books,

293
00:14:34,020 --> 00:14:36,820
the one, I got one particular one

294
00:14:36,820 --> 00:14:39,440
that I think I still have like in storage somewhere.

295
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:41,960
and it was just like, you know,

296
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:43,420
it's called like a thousand jokes

297
00:14:43,420 --> 00:14:44,960
to tell your friends or whatever,

298
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:47,960
but it was clearly from like the turn of the century

299
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:50,620
because all of the jokes were about leprosy.

300
00:14:50,620 --> 00:14:52,640
(laughing)

301
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:55,280
And I, like one of them was like,

302
00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:58,100
was like, what do you call a leper in a bathtub?

303
00:14:58,100 --> 00:14:59,640
Soup.

304
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:02,560
And I remember going to my dad and his,

305
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:03,880
while he was like working, I was like,

306
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:07,280
hey dad, what do you call a leper in a bathtub?

307
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:08,120
Soup. - And he was like soup.

308
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:14,400
is what I was and my dad was just like I don't even know what that's like yeah

309
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:20,400
that's it that's one old-ass book yeah we should write a joke book that might be

310
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:25,280
the best yeah we should definitely should write another book yeah a joke book

311
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:29,920
would be a good genre you know when was the last time you saw a joke book I found

312
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:35,200
you and I wish I had there was a I had the there was when I was in Edinburgh

313
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:40,240
there was I was staying at Aaron's place and they like um they just had this bookshelf that was full

314
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:44,400
of books from like the previous owner and there was one there was just like this joke book where

315
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:49,120
just none of the jokes made any sense at all and I can't remember them but like they're all just

316
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:55,440
stuff like like what uh what happens when a bully there's a schoolyard fight and then it said the

317
00:15:55,440 --> 00:16:02,320
answer is like there's likely to be a collision it just like just it just like isn't jokes I wish I

318
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:07,420
had it oh that's that classic British way yeah that's that's like British humor

319
00:16:07,420 --> 00:16:14,060
yeah that's like Stuart Lee that's like Stuart Little that's exactly like

320
00:16:14,060 --> 00:16:19,380
Stuart Little Stuart Little did I'm imagining a Def Jam comic named Stuart

321
00:16:19,380 --> 00:16:29,720
Little who's never heard of the movie I'm reading the table of contents of the

322
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:34,440

323
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:40,360
occupied for a while. Yeah yeah there's um there's a chapter called chapter one guys

325
00:16:52,320 --> 00:17:01,280
1999 the year of the nine. Imagine being Tony Hawk. Being Tony Hawk like a guy who a guy who

326
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:07,920
we grew up like skateboarding or whatever like you know probably it was pretty rough and tumble and

327
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:12,080
then you go to write your biography and they're like this has to appeal to seven-year-olds.

328
00:17:12,080 --> 00:17:18,160
Yeah. Like you the the one that the chapter you wrote that's called fuck cancer in the ass you

329
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:20,400
You have to change it to "cancer stinks."

330
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:20,900
Yeah.

331
00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:25,200
And you have to cut out all of the text from it, except for "I don't like cancer."

332
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:25,700
Yeah.

333
00:17:25,700 --> 00:17:26,200
Yeah.

334
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:27,900
And you have to take out your drawings, Tony.

Yeah.

336
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:30,400
Your drawings cannot be in the book.

00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:46,400
Your detailed log of events.

342
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:51,680

People being tortured on racks.

431
00:24:15,140 --> 00:24:16,780
Yeah, there was always the guy

432
00:24:16,780 --> 00:24:18,900
who was being stretched to his body's limits

433
00:24:18,900 --> 00:24:20,540
on the wall across from you.

434
00:24:20,540 --> 00:24:21,900
And sometimes, and the thing--

435
00:24:21,900 --> 00:24:22,740
What a room.

436
00:24:22,740 --> 00:24:24,420
If you knew a comedian was great,

437
00:24:24,420 --> 00:24:27,860
if he could get people's attention away from that guy.

438
00:24:27,860 --> 00:24:30,940
If you could kill despite the man being drawn and quartered.

439
00:24:30,940 --> 00:24:33,220
The only comedian I've ever seen

440
00:24:33,220 --> 00:24:36,060
find the treasure chest was Freddie Prinze Sr.

441
00:24:36,060 --> 00:24:38,060

445
00:24:45,380 --> 00:24:46,460
Just like, oh my God,

446
00:24:46,460 --> 00:24:49,100
the guy who used to just absolutely destroy,

447
00:24:49,100 --> 00:24:51,860
his name was Fat Fucking Retard.

448
00:24:51,860 --> 00:24:54,700
And he would go in, and people just fucking,

449
00:24:54,700 --> 00:24:57,020
they just couldn't believe this guy, he was so funny.

450
00:24:57,020 --> 00:24:59,180
He would fart into the microphone for two hours

451
00:24:59,180 --> 00:25:00,020
and people would listen.

452
00:25:00,020 --> 00:25:02,220
- Yeah, the older Boston Comics who were like,

453
00:25:02,220 --> 00:25:05,760
yeah, we used to go to this place in fucking like downtown.

454
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:08,320
Yeah, it was just called Cancer.

455
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:10,200
That was the entire name of the club.

456
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:12,640
It was called Cancer, and the host was this guy,

457
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:16,400
his name was Jimmy Savino, and Jimmy Savino--

458
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:18,080
His name was Jimmy Saville.

459
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:23,080
Jimmy Saville, and he actively was

460
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:26,840
being searched for a manslaughter case.

461
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:27,680
Yeah, yeah.

462
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:29,240
And he talked about it all the time.

463
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:30,360
He was so guilty.

464
00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:32,060
But he called it being on tour.

465
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:38,160
There was this big fat guy, O. Patrick O'Sullivan, he used to throw full beer bottles into the

466
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:40,160
crowd and hit women.

467
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:41,160
We loved him, dude.

468
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:42,160
Oh, he did this bit this one night.

469
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:45,560
You wouldn't see someone like that in New York.

470
00:25:45,560 --> 00:25:47,320
He did this bit this one night.

471
00:25:47,320 --> 00:25:48,840
It was so crazy.

472
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:51,960
He called the white lady the N-word.

473
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:52,960
It fucking destroyed.

474
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:53,960
It destroyed.

475
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:56,040
You have no idea how bad that killed.

476
00:25:56,040 --> 00:25:57,940
Oh my god, dude.

477
00:25:57,940 --> 00:26:00,320
Some of the greatest comedians ever.

00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:02,160

The Great Vagina.

483
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:15,160

00:26:26,660 --> 00:26:31,160
Oh, man, Dennis Leary stole all of Chocolate Bambino's material, man.

489
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:35,160
Dennis Leary would be nowhere as the wizard of the jungle.

490
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:41,760
Louis C.K., Eugene Merman, Klu Klux Kanye, I mean these were the comedians in the 90s.

491
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:49,760
They would go up at the studio and they would fucking just destroy for six people.

492
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:50,760
Oh my god.

493
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:54,240

495
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:00,560

00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:18,320
- Yeah, I mean that's like truly the secret

502
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:21,520
to all the like, you know, romantic stories

503
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:24,920
that comedians tell is you have to keep in mind like,

504
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:29,240
oh, they were all on, they were all high out of their minds

505
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:30,080
on cocaine. - Yeah, right.

506
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:33,280
- There was nobody in the audience, they all sucked.

507
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:34,200
- Yeah. - Right.

508
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:37,200
It's just in some quiet, like literally like the Middle East

509
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:39,480
where everybody's like, like all the fucking,

510
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:42,760
the most representative thing of like any comedy scene

511
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:44,480
I think are those Sam Hyde videos

512
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:45,960
where he's just fucking up the mic.

513
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:49,720
- Oh my God, where John Paul Rivera has to tackle him to--

514
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:50,680
- Yeah.

515
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:54,600
- I talked to, apparently one of the videos,

516
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:57,720
I looked this up 'cause I was talking to,

517
00:27:57,720 --> 00:27:59,120
you know Liam McGurk?

518
00:27:59,120 --> 00:27:59,940
- Yeah.

519
00:27:59,940 --> 00:28:02,080
- So I was talking to him about all that shit

520
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:03,600
and he was like, he's like,

521
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:06,320
"Yeah, I'm like the star of one of those videos."

522
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:08,320
And I was like, "I have to find this."

523
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:09,760
And it's a video where just,

524
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:15,240
apparently Sam would like bring like 20 people

525
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:18,580
who are like his fans to all the mics at the Middle East.

526
00:28:18,580 --> 00:28:19,420
- Yeah.

527
00:28:19,420 --> 00:28:22,080
- And McGurk one time went up after him

528
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:24,380
and like called Sam gay or whatever,

529
00:28:24,380 --> 00:28:26,460
and they started recording and it's just,

530
00:28:26,460 --> 00:28:29,660
it's Liam McGurk, it's like that Bill Burr set

531
00:28:29,660 --> 00:28:32,340
in like Philly where he's yelling at all the like

532
00:28:32,340 --> 00:28:36,500
Philly fans, but it's Liam McGurk with like 25

533
00:28:36,500 --> 00:28:40,220
just like of the biggest losers in New England.

534
00:28:40,220 --> 00:28:41,060
- Damn.

535
00:28:41,060 --> 00:28:43,380
- It's incredible.

536
00:28:43,380 --> 00:28:44,220
- Yeah.

537
00:28:44,220 --> 00:28:46,940
- It's so funny to watch the Guttaman thing

538
00:28:46,940 --> 00:28:49,500
and be like, oh, I recognize people here.

539
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:50,340
- Right, yeah.

540
00:28:50,340 --> 00:28:51,180
- Yeah. - No, that was the craziest thing.

541
00:28:51,180 --> 00:28:52,000
- I think one of the Guttaman--

542
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:52,840
- That was so crazy.

543
00:28:52,840 --> 00:28:55,500
- Like Sean Carter, he namedropped Sean Carter

544
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:58,140
at the beginning of the Guttaman set or something.

545
00:28:58,140 --> 00:28:59,340
Something crazy, yeah.

546
00:28:59,340 --> 00:29:02,340
- And Rob Kreen, when he does the Retard Kyle video,

547
00:29:02,340 --> 00:29:04,380
where he's like, "Thank you, Rob Kreen."

548
00:29:04,380 --> 00:29:07,380
- Yeah, man. - Yeah.

549
00:29:07,380 --> 00:29:09,500
- Oh, he just lost his mic.

550
00:29:09,500 --> 00:29:10,700
- Rob Kreen? - Yeah, 'cause

551
00:29:10,700 --> 00:29:12,060
Greg Scott shut down. - 730?

552
00:29:12,060 --> 00:29:14,060
- No, 'cause-- - No, no, Greg Scott is--

553
00:29:14,060 --> 00:29:15,520
Now Great Scott's the uh...

554
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:17,140
Well the gas is gone.

555
00:29:17,140 --> 00:29:18,460
Yeah the gas is gone now.

556
00:29:18,460 --> 00:29:20,500
That's what you do, you're gas dude.

557
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:21,980
They'll just do shows at 730.

558
00:29:21,980 --> 00:29:22,740
Those are um...

559
00:29:22,740 --> 00:29:23,500
That's true.

560
00:29:23,500 --> 00:29:24,580
Yeah, those are...

561
00:29:24,580 --> 00:29:28,020
The gas is where I saw Dan Licata and Joe Pera.

562
00:29:28,020 --> 00:29:29,420
And Conor O'Malley.

563
00:29:29,420 --> 00:29:30,100
Oh really?

564
00:29:30,100 --> 00:29:30,900
Yeah.

565
00:29:30,900 --> 00:29:31,780
It was a good show.

566
00:29:31,780 --> 00:29:33,620
We should get Dan on the podcast.

567
00:29:33,620 --> 00:29:35,220
We should do anything.

568
00:29:35,220 --> 00:29:36,020
We should do...

569
00:29:36,020 --> 00:29:37,300
We should do something.

570
00:29:37,300 --> 00:29:38,660
We should fucking do something, yeah.

571
00:29:38,660 --> 00:29:40,020
We should do something.

572
00:29:40,020 --> 00:29:41,020
I'll ask him.

573
00:29:41,020 --> 00:29:42,140
Yeah, we gotta get...

574
00:29:42,140 --> 00:29:43,540
We gotta fucking figure out...

575
00:29:43,540 --> 00:29:46,660
Let's make a, who are, what's our dream team to come on?

576
00:29:46,660 --> 00:29:49,180
- Our dream, my dream guest on the show.

577
00:29:49,180 --> 00:29:50,180
- Dream guest, all right.

578
00:29:50,180 --> 00:29:51,060
- Tony Hawk.

579
00:29:51,060 --> 00:29:52,860
- Maybe.

580
00:29:52,860 --> 00:29:55,300
Bam Margera, but that's already been done.

581
00:29:55,300 --> 00:29:56,620
- Coney Hawk.

582
00:29:56,620 --> 00:29:57,460
- Coney O'Brien.

583
00:29:57,460 --> 00:29:59,220
- Coney.

584
00:29:59,220 --> 00:30:00,140
Coney Hawk.

585
00:30:00,140 --> 00:30:01,780
We should get Chocolate Pampino.

586
00:30:01,780 --> 00:30:02,900
I don't think that that's.

587
00:30:02,900 --> 00:30:04,100
(laughing)

588
00:30:04,100 --> 00:30:05,520
I mean, he's still in the scene.

589
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:07,260
He's still in the Boston comedy scene.

590
00:30:07,260 --> 00:30:08,940
You see him, you see him every--

591
00:30:08,940 --> 00:30:11,220
- You see him preying on young women at every mic.

592
00:30:11,220 --> 00:30:13,980
Every night, every night at Thunder Bar.

593
00:30:13,980 --> 00:30:16,380
- At the women's mic in a wig, man.

594
00:30:16,380 --> 00:30:17,940
If I know Chocolate Bambino.

595
00:30:17,940 --> 00:30:20,220
- Oh, Chocolate Bambino's up there.

596
00:30:20,220 --> 00:30:21,180
- Oh my God.

597
00:30:21,180 --> 00:30:22,740
- He's fuckin' up there, dude.

598
00:30:22,740 --> 00:30:24,420
- Legend.

599
00:30:24,420 --> 00:30:25,780
- Legend of the scene.

600
00:30:25,780 --> 00:30:27,940
- That was one of the weirdest things

601
00:30:27,940 --> 00:30:30,900
about being in the Boston comedy scene

602
00:30:30,900 --> 00:30:32,780
is just realizing at some point

603
00:30:32,780 --> 00:30:35,580
that everybody in it is 45 years old.

604
00:30:35,580 --> 00:30:38,460
- Yeah, and then you go up and no one,

605
00:30:38,460 --> 00:30:40,820
like half the time, it's like, oh, was that funny?

606
00:30:40,820 --> 00:30:42,900
or did they just not understand me

607
00:30:42,900 --> 00:30:44,620
'cause of some generational--

608
00:30:44,620 --> 00:30:46,500
- Yeah, a huge generational gap.

609
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:47,340
- Yeah.

610
00:30:47,340 --> 00:30:48,660
- 'Cause they grew up watching "M*A*S*H."

611
00:30:48,660 --> 00:30:49,500
- Yeah.

612
00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:50,660
- They grew up watching, yeah, fuckin' they're like,

613
00:30:50,660 --> 00:30:53,660
"Oh, you look like the guy from 'Different Strokes.'"

614
00:30:53,660 --> 00:30:54,500
And it's like--

615
00:30:54,500 --> 00:30:55,320
- Yeah, yeah.

616
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:58,080
And they also all just drink more every night

617
00:30:58,080 --> 00:30:59,740
than I have in my life.

618
00:30:59,740 --> 00:31:01,260
- Yeah.

619
00:31:01,260 --> 00:31:02,580
- Just Irish fucking--

620
00:31:02,580 --> 00:31:04,860
- Dude, I miss it so much, dude.

621
00:31:04,860 --> 00:31:06,220
- Oh my God.

622
00:31:06,220 --> 00:31:09,700
I don't miss hosting, but I miss just like--

623
00:31:09,700 --> 00:31:11,700
I miss hideout more than anything.

624
00:31:11,700 --> 00:31:12,540
I was thinking about it.

625
00:31:12,540 --> 00:31:13,580
I'm thinking about it right now

626
00:31:13,580 --> 00:31:15,700
because I'm just drinking alone.

627
00:31:15,700 --> 00:31:17,980
And I just say, oh my God, if only I could,

628
00:31:17,980 --> 00:31:22,180
only I could be drinking a beer in the same room

629
00:31:22,180 --> 00:31:26,080
as some guy named like fucking Irish McIrish.

630
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:26,920
And he's going up--

631
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:28,140
You can just say Irish O'Neil.

632
00:31:28,140 --> 00:31:28,980
Yeah.

633
00:31:28,980 --> 00:31:30,620
(laughing)

634
00:31:30,620 --> 00:31:31,660
Fucking Irish O'Neil.

635
00:31:31,660 --> 00:31:33,940
He's doing some set about how he's like,

636
00:31:33,940 --> 00:31:36,180
how he likes heavy metal or something.

637
00:31:36,180 --> 00:31:37,020
Yeah.

638
00:31:37,020 --> 00:31:38,600
That sounds like a killer material to me.

639
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:43,200
that long right now can i do some so let's hear some i don't know if you guys ever

640
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:49,000
heard of this iron maiden but i prefer uh... metal man

641
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,240

do another rhyme okay so what if

644
00:31:56,380 --> 00:31:59,480
pakistan imagine if we took uh...

645
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:03,160
metallica and instead of metal was made out of wood what would that sound like i

646
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:06,880
think it'll go a little something like this

647
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:08,280
hello come in

648
00:32:08,280 --> 00:32:12,400
That's a little bit of my like, kind of play with the format.

649
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:15,600
Dude, that's that is the best part about Boston comedy is that

650
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:21,440
like every once a week, some guy some old like 70 year old Boston

651
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:25,120
comic name. Yeah, Jimmy, Jimmy. Mr.

652
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:29,980
Well, Jimmy, Jimmy, Jimmy, the fuck, he'll walk in off the

653
00:32:29,980 --> 00:32:32,160
street in a full Adidas tracksuit.

654
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:34,240
Oh, I know what guy you're actually

655
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:39,240
Yeah, and he'll try doing prop comedy without any props.

656
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:40,320
Yeah.

657
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:41,440
And he'll be like, "I saved the props

658
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:43,240
"for a paying audience."

659
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:45,640
And make little jokes like that.

660
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:46,480
Yeah.

661
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:49,800
And the best part is he kills, everybody loves him.

662
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:54,160
Dude, it's so, I don't get the audiences here.

663
00:32:54,160 --> 00:32:56,320
That's the biggest reason why I stopped hosting

664
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:57,680
is I don't understand.

665
00:32:57,680 --> 00:33:00,120
A guy went to the hideout, Mike, one night,

666
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:03,340
this old guy who was in from Philly,

667
00:33:03,340 --> 00:33:07,820
And he just went up with a notebook and he'd been taking notes on everybody's set before him

668
00:33:07,820 --> 00:33:10,220
And he started doing-

669
00:33:10,220 --> 00:33:15,700
He was like, "I haven't written any new material, so I'm just gonna do other people's sets tonight."

670
00:33:15,700 --> 00:33:23,460
And then he was like, uh, Sam Hyde- or Sam Hyde. Sam Hyke was hosting and he was like, "Um, alright first to host,

671
00:33:23,460 --> 00:33:25,860
I'm a black guy."

672
00:33:25,860 --> 00:33:27,860
[laughter]

673
00:33:27,860 --> 00:33:29,860
And he fucking killed dude.

674
00:33:29,860 --> 00:33:31,860
God damn.

675
00:33:31,860 --> 00:33:37,140

missed it I'm excited to I'm excited to be back yeah it's so funny how long

679
00:33:52,780 --> 00:33:57,100
Muya stayed open like while everything else was shutting down around it like the

680
00:33:57,100 --> 00:34:01,020
mic yeah like every other mic like they kind of like didn't do like Muya was one

681
00:34:01,020 --> 00:34:05,220
of the only mics that stay on. Yeah man, Mooya's still going. Yeah it's still going right now.

682
00:34:05,220 --> 00:34:09,900
They're doing curbside pickup. Do write a joke down on a little piece of paper. Yeah,

683
00:34:09,900 --> 00:34:15,940
Gurby's hosting. He's showing up like three hours before. Yeah. Yeah, they're, they're

684
00:34:15,940 --> 00:34:22,020
fucking, for the listeners, there's this guy. He's turned it into his speakeasy. Yeah. Gurby's

685
00:34:22,020 --> 00:34:29,860
hideaway. Yeah. Dude, Gurby, that one time that he, that one time that he fucking went

686
00:34:29,860 --> 00:34:34,140
up and said that whole set about how white women are ruining comedy and then like

687
00:34:34,140 --> 00:34:40,500
after that was just it was just for just for Emerson girls had like signed up

688
00:34:40,500 --> 00:34:43,700
immediately after him and it was one of the days I think it was one of the days

689
00:34:43,700 --> 00:34:49,580
Ben was hosting damn dude which I think I might have been hosting I don't know I

690
00:34:49,580 --> 00:34:53,580
like that for whatever reason open mics have become like the final frontier of

691
00:34:53,580 --> 00:34:55,640
of social justice.

692
00:34:55,640 --> 00:34:56,480
- Right, like who fucking--

693
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:59,140
- That's so funny, just who cares, dude.

694
00:34:59,140 --> 00:35:00,340
- Who gives a shit?

695
00:35:00,340 --> 00:35:03,180
- You're talking, you're speaking directly into the void

696
00:35:03,180 --> 00:35:04,180
if there ever were one.

697
00:35:04,180 --> 00:35:05,020
- Yeah.

698
00:35:05,020 --> 00:35:07,900
- Right, like nobody laughs at open mics, dude.

699
00:35:07,900 --> 00:35:08,740
- No.

700
00:35:08,740 --> 00:35:10,540
- Nobody laughs, people just wanna say like,

701
00:35:10,540 --> 00:35:13,380
like literally open mics would be so much better

702
00:35:13,380 --> 00:35:15,700
for people in Boston specifically

703
00:35:15,700 --> 00:35:17,380
if it was just like you say your joke

704
00:35:17,380 --> 00:35:19,140
and then people go like, yeah that was good

705
00:35:19,140 --> 00:35:20,860
but you could use some work right there.

706
00:35:20,860 --> 00:35:26,580
That's how when me and Neil first started going to Mouya like three years ago or whatever

707
00:35:26,580 --> 00:35:28,140
and we were both getting started.

708
00:35:28,140 --> 00:35:29,460
It was three, it was four people there.

709
00:35:29,460 --> 00:35:30,460
With De La Volpe hosted?

710
00:35:30,460 --> 00:35:31,460
Yeah, De La Volpe hosted.

711
00:35:31,460 --> 00:35:37,220
There was four people there every week and most weeks we would walk in and he would be

712
00:35:37,220 --> 00:35:41,860
like okay there's four people here, we're not gonna like turn the lights off, we're

713
00:35:41,860 --> 00:35:48,180
just gonna have like a joke workshop and it was by far the most like the productive like

714
00:35:48,180 --> 00:35:51,420
like an hour you could spend in Boston Comedy.

715
00:35:51,420 --> 00:35:53,300
Just because like it doesn't, I don't know,

716
00:35:53,300 --> 00:35:55,380
everybody's on their phones, nobody cares.

717
00:35:55,380 --> 00:35:56,220
You know what I mean?

718
00:35:56,220 --> 00:35:58,420
Everyone in Boston Comedy just wants

719
00:35:58,420 --> 00:35:59,460
to do their fucking thing.

720
00:35:59,460 --> 00:36:01,500
Well, but that's the truth about just like

721
00:36:01,500 --> 00:36:02,980
open mics in general right now.

722
00:36:02,980 --> 00:36:04,540
Is that the market is so flooded,

723
00:36:04,540 --> 00:36:06,020
the only people who go to open mics,

724
00:36:06,020 --> 00:36:07,740
there's so many of them, and the only people

725
00:36:07,740 --> 00:36:09,580
who go are other comics, and other comics,

726
00:36:09,580 --> 00:36:12,180
like I mean, I don't care about anybody's jokes

727
00:36:12,180 --> 00:36:15,340
except like the three close friends I have there.

728
00:36:15,340 --> 00:36:16,160
You know what I mean?

729
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:18,520
I'm not gonna listen to somebody set.

730
00:36:18,520 --> 00:36:20,360
It was great when it was just like us

731
00:36:20,360 --> 00:36:22,840
on like the Thursday mics when it was basically just like us

732
00:36:22,840 --> 00:36:25,640
and then whatever fucking dumb ass were off the street

733
00:36:25,640 --> 00:36:26,480
would show up.

734
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:27,880
Yeah, man, that was paradise.

735
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:28,720
Dude, that was the best.

736
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:29,540
But then it got too big.

737
00:36:29,540 --> 00:36:30,480
Yeah.

738
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:33,200
Then it got up to, you know, 15, 16 people.

739
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:35,360
15 people, that was when it started to suck.

740
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:37,360
That's really the, that's where, yeah.

741
00:36:37,360 --> 00:36:38,200
I mean, that is true.

742
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:41,000
It's like when I was hosting the Muya Mike

743
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:42,600
and we would get like 11 people

744
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:45,120
and everybody would do seven minute sets,

745
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:48,160
It was easily the most fun I've had doing live comedy.

746
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:49,880
Oh my God, the first time I did,

747
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:52,620
the first time I ever ran a fucking Greg Pepper set.

748
00:36:52,620 --> 00:36:54,400
Yeah, it was way back when.

749
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:56,600
Uh-huh, the Subway 2.

750
00:36:56,600 --> 00:36:57,640
Subway 2.

751
00:36:57,640 --> 00:36:58,800
Uh-huh.

752
00:36:58,800 --> 00:36:59,640
God.

753
00:36:59,640 --> 00:37:01,080
Cameron used to go to Mike's.

754
00:37:01,080 --> 00:37:02,720
What are we, old men?

755
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:04,200
Yeah, we're all reminiscing about shit

756
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:05,280
that happened a year ago.

757
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:07,440
We're no better than those 80-year-olds.

758
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:08,280
Yeah, I know.

759
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:11,280
In Boston comedy who remember--

760
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:14,200
Jimmy the fucking bitch.

761
00:37:14,200 --> 00:37:16,120
- Jimmy the fucking pussy wagon.

762
00:37:16,120 --> 00:37:17,220
- Yeah. - Yeah.

763
00:37:17,220 --> 00:37:22,340
- We gotta go to like a show at like Calhoun

764
00:37:22,340 --> 00:37:24,400
or like Princess Pizza.

765
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:28,640
- I was talking to Gus, I think Gus is gonna get me

766
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:31,080
some spots at Calhoun because--

767
00:37:31,080 --> 00:37:33,740
- Damn. - They pay really well, dude.

768
00:37:33,740 --> 00:37:35,440
- Dude, Calhoun-- - For people who don't know,

769
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:37,240
Calhoun is like a tiki bar.

770
00:37:37,240 --> 00:37:42,240
- It's a Chinese restaurant that's Polynesian themed

771
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:43,540
for some reason. - Okay.

772
00:37:43,540 --> 00:37:46,740
It's got like, it's huge.

773
00:37:46,740 --> 00:37:49,620
It's one of the biggest places I've ever been in, I think.

774
00:37:49,620 --> 00:37:50,460
Yeah.

775
00:37:50,460 --> 00:37:51,420
It's like a Walmart.

776
00:37:51,420 --> 00:37:52,900
Yeah, it's the size of,

777
00:37:52,900 --> 00:37:55,100
it's a restaurant the size of a Walmart.

778
00:37:55,100 --> 00:37:57,980
Patrick has never been anything bigger than a Walmart.

779
00:37:57,980 --> 00:37:58,820
No.

780
00:37:58,820 --> 00:37:59,940
He's never been outside.

781
00:37:59,940 --> 00:38:00,760
No.

782
00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:02,900
Patrick walks around a series of underground tunnels.

783
00:38:02,900 --> 00:38:03,740
Yeah.

784
00:38:03,740 --> 00:38:05,580
He has a hamster habitat.

785
00:38:05,580 --> 00:38:07,500
I'm Patrick Mohlman.

786
00:38:07,500 --> 00:38:09,460
But it's in Saugus.

787
00:38:09,460 --> 00:38:11,540
It's next to the Saugus Walmart.

788
00:38:12,380 --> 00:38:14,300
I used to live really, I lived like 20 minutes away from it.

789
00:38:14,300 --> 00:38:15,900
You used to live in the Walmart, dude.

790
00:38:15,900 --> 00:38:16,740
Yeah.

791
00:38:16,740 --> 00:38:19,620
You lived in the Walmart bathroom under the toilet.

792
00:38:19,620 --> 00:38:21,620
Apparently they pay like, you know,

793
00:38:21,620 --> 00:38:24,100
250 bucks for a hosting gig there.

794
00:38:24,100 --> 00:38:25,180
Oh, that's not bad.

795
00:38:25,180 --> 00:38:28,040
Yeah, so I was like, yeah man, I'll fucking,

796
00:38:28,040 --> 00:38:29,380
I'll do that, no problem.

797
00:38:29,380 --> 00:38:31,740
I'll embarrass myself in front of--

798
00:38:31,740 --> 00:38:32,700
Soggiest townies?

799
00:38:32,700 --> 00:38:35,260
The fattest people in America.

800
00:38:35,260 --> 00:38:36,140
I don't care.

801
00:38:36,140 --> 00:38:38,480
The food there is fucking great.

802
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:40,140
Yeah, I'll never find out.

803
00:38:40,140 --> 00:38:42,380
Dude, you gotta do it.

804
00:38:42,380 --> 00:38:43,380
You gotta-- - Do I?

805
00:38:43,380 --> 00:38:44,660
- We gotta go to Kowloon.

806
00:38:44,660 --> 00:38:46,540
- We should go to a will in this one.

807
00:38:46,540 --> 00:38:50,180
- We should, honestly, if we at some point this year

808
00:38:50,180 --> 00:38:53,460
do a live pod, we should do it at the Kowloon.

809
00:38:53,460 --> 00:38:55,580
- Yeah, dude, that'd be awesome.

810
00:38:55,580 --> 00:38:56,740
- That'd be so sick. - When I did the poll,

811
00:38:56,740 --> 00:38:58,380
when I did the poll, it was basically even

812
00:38:58,380 --> 00:39:01,260
New York, LA, Chicago, Boston.

813
00:39:01,260 --> 00:39:03,180
So we might as well do it in Boston.

814
00:39:03,180 --> 00:39:04,020
- Yeah. - Yeah.

815
00:39:04,020 --> 00:39:06,580
- And Kowloon is like, you can drive to it.

816
00:39:06,580 --> 00:39:08,820
We could do a carpool, who gives a fuck?

817
00:39:08,820 --> 00:39:09,660
- Yeah.

818
00:39:09,660 --> 00:39:10,960
We'll just pick people up in a van.

819
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:14,120
- Yeah, just driving around Massachusetts,

820
00:39:14,120 --> 00:39:14,960
picking people up.

821
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:17,000
- Just picking up various podcast fans,

822
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:18,400
taking them to the Kowloon.

823
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:21,400
- And making a fight to the death.

824
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:24,800
- We could get like six or seven

825
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:26,580
poopoo platters for everyone.

826
00:39:26,580 --> 00:39:29,120
- Yeah, and then a special poop-he-pee platter for Patrick.

827
00:39:29,120 --> 00:39:30,320
- What is a poopoo platter?

828
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:32,240
Because the only poopoo platter I'm aware of

829
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:34,320
is from A Bug's Life.

830
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:36,800
- It's like appetizers,

831
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:39,600
it's like the entire appetizer menu.

832
00:39:39,600 --> 00:39:42,880
Chinese restaurant it's like you get like the why would you call it get why

833
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:48,300
would you okay if it's like a if it's a matter of my favorite it's my favorite

834
00:39:48,300 --> 00:39:51,680
thing to get with people at a Chinese restaurant getting the poopoo you just

835
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:56,040
like you just like ordering something with poopoo in the name yeah it doesn't

836
00:39:56,040 --> 00:40:00,280
it helps the truth is that order walked into a Chinese restaurant and asked for

837
00:40:00,280 --> 00:40:03,660
poopoo and then they brought him the poopoo platter and he's like well it's

838
00:40:03,660 --> 00:40:07,200
not what I ordered but I guess it's good yeah this is I know this is meant for

839
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:12,200
two people too so thank you yeah cuz there's two poos mm-hmm Patrick order

840
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:17,680
goes into Kowloon and he asked the waitress for a pea star pea star platter

841
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:26,180
asterisk he says it out loud like that yeah he's a nurse mm-hmm that in the

842
00:40:26,180 --> 00:40:29,760
Kowloon adventure that's another good menu item I'm gonna take you on a

843
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:34,760
Kowloon adventure motherfucker I'm gonna take you yeah China and leave you there

844
00:40:34,760 --> 00:40:39,880
I'm gonna take you on a Kowloon adventure when we go to Kowloon for the show. I'm

845
00:40:39,880 --> 00:40:44,440
gonna put you through a legend of China. Honestly the more I think about it the

846
00:40:44,440 --> 00:40:51,240
more a Kowloon live show is so great. It's so funny. Yeah. That's so good. We will

847
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:57,080
definitely be doing that. Hopefully. I mean if it ever reopens. Yeah if it ever

848
00:40:57,080 --> 00:41:03,280
reopens and like shit. Yeah. Because I mean a Moo Yat's live show would be

849
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:09,680
terrible. We can't do that. It's not... I can't subject people to that.

850
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:14,680
Yeah. You know like I've done I think for me I've pushed the limit to that room.

851
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:21,640
Me too. I don't want to. Yeah. I can't do a fucking like yeah for 40 people or

852
00:41:21,640 --> 00:41:25,720
whatever that that room holds I can't do that to people who it's like yeah I want

853
00:41:25,720 --> 00:41:30,520
you to yeah I want keep liking me. I want you to save the Grinch. I can't subject you to this.

854
00:41:30,520 --> 00:41:35,160
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I yeah leaks man when we were doing oh my god

855
00:41:35,160 --> 00:41:38,520
when we were recording on John's album there there was a

856
00:41:38,520 --> 00:41:44,040
There was a woman in the back. Thank God. It was somebody from from Emerson

857
00:41:44,040 --> 00:41:46,040
but there was a woman in the back who was

858
00:41:46,040 --> 00:41:51,760
the entire show just like a gallon of water was being dumped on from a leaky pipe and

859
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:57,240
Thank God that bitch shut the hell up kept it to herself because I was watching her the whole time

860
00:41:57,240 --> 00:42:03,000
I mean that would that is like truly weaponized like shyness. Yeah, it was just watching her like

861
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:09,080
Like I was like, oh this is for once like like one of these fucking dumbasses not knowing how to socially communicate

862
00:42:09,080 --> 00:42:14,980
He's doing me a huge favor right now because she's not complaining in the middle of us recording an album

863
00:42:14,980 --> 00:42:22,200
But she's having she's just getting absolutely facial by do you water from the worst fucking fucking fast-food restaurant America?

864
00:42:22,280 --> 00:42:27,640
The fucking pipe bleep the pipe burst at the PowerPoint show we tried to do so funny man

865
00:42:27,640 --> 00:42:31,040
That could not have happened at a better point in this

866
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:35,880
Yeah, yeah, I put it put that show out of its misery

867
00:42:35,880 --> 00:42:41,440
Yeah, I mean we we that was the first time I've ever hosted and I felt like oh

868
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:42,640
I'm doing a good job

869
00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:48,560
Finally like I've found a rhythm and everything and then like we did the Jamie show Jamie loft this show like a week later

870
00:42:48,560 --> 00:42:50,400
And I was like oh

871
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:56,920
Yeah, none of this this isn't for me. I can't do this all of my jokes fell flat. No one in the audience liked me

872
00:42:56,920 --> 00:43:03,860
That's what I like to see man. Yeah, my boys thriving. Uh-huh. Yeah, just just just unable to talk in front of people

873
00:43:03,860 --> 00:43:08,540
No, I like everything that I like Ben and I would try to like talk to each other

874
00:43:08,540 --> 00:43:12,380
I think at one point I said like something like hey, if you don't do that, I'm gonna kill myself

875
00:43:12,380 --> 00:43:18,200
And then it was just dead silent. I mean, that's probably not the audience to do that. Yeah

876
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:25,520
Yeah, yeah, I don't know. I don't know if the the Jamie Loftus audience is gonna be very receptive to be

877
00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:27,600
Threatening to kill myself. Yeah, I don't know

878
00:43:27,600 --> 00:43:31,760
She does she does nice. She does nice stuff. Yeah

879
00:43:31,760 --> 00:43:38,360
Yeah, that's tough like five separate people in the audience dial the suicide hotline for you. Hey, are you okay?

880
00:43:38,360 --> 00:43:45,640
They raise their hand and they wait to be called on

881
00:43:47,160 --> 00:43:49,160
And then they say are you okay?

882
00:43:49,160 --> 00:43:55,400
Yeah, yeah, you guys think apes will take over cuz here's the thing let's get out of this. This is - yeah

883
00:43:55,400 --> 00:43:57,400
I don't want to talk about this

884
00:43:57,400 --> 00:44:02,420
Cuz I've been watching the reboot planet of the apes video movies the videos

885
00:44:02,420 --> 00:44:13,040
These are great videos, but by God are they fucking long I haven't I I haven't I've watched the first two

886
00:44:14,040 --> 00:44:19,580
I haven't watched the last one yet, but the way that the apes take over is that they the humans

887
00:44:19,580 --> 00:44:22,420
Create a virus in a lab

888
00:44:22,420 --> 00:44:29,960
Whoa that the virus infects the monkeys and makes them really make smart, but it also but it infects humans and kills them and kills

889
00:44:29,960 --> 00:44:34,120
Like what is it? I didn't know I didn't know it kills humans. Yeah, it kills

890
00:44:34,120 --> 00:44:39,780
Why they get rid of the people only one in 500 humans survives. So that's why all the people are gone

891
00:44:39,800 --> 00:44:44,960
So you do you guys think that maybe in the redwood forest right now the apes are building a castle

892
00:44:44,960 --> 00:44:49,960
While we're all dying from the virus and the virus is making them stronger smarter and more agile

893
00:44:49,960 --> 00:44:53,800
And the animal is definitely more affected by the virus

894
00:44:53,800 --> 00:45:01,000
This isn't it like pangolins. It's not bad pangolins the fucking the little angle armadillo look you fucking idiot

895
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:03,000
There's no a layer. What's your dog?

896
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:05,120
Pangolian is an instrument. Yeah

897
00:45:05,520 --> 00:45:11,840
Mongolian is the kind of person that works at Kowloon.

898
00:45:11,840 --> 00:45:17,120
That's the fusion of Polynesian and Mongolian.

899
00:45:17,120 --> 00:45:18,120
Yeah.

900
00:45:18,120 --> 00:45:22,800
Well, I think that the apes are going to take over.

901
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:25,200
I think it's a different animal that's rising up.

902
00:45:25,200 --> 00:45:27,000
If bats rose up, planet of the bats.

903
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:28,000
That's what I'm saying.

904
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:31,920
Now, that would be scary because we would be dealing with a whole bunch of Draculas.

905
00:45:31,920 --> 00:45:34,800
I feel like lions are number one.

906
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:35,800
No.

907
00:45:35,800 --> 00:45:38,920
Can you imagine if there was a lion with a calculator?

908
00:45:38,920 --> 00:45:41,600
No imagine a lion with a calculator.

909
00:45:41,600 --> 00:45:46,720
You know how you throw a ball of yarn down a big hole, the lion's jumping down there.

910
00:45:46,720 --> 00:45:49,240
He's too smart, he's creating digital yarn.

911
00:45:49,240 --> 00:45:51,640
He can't suppress the instinct.

912
00:45:51,640 --> 00:45:54,080
He's using yarn on his computer.

913
00:45:54,080 --> 00:45:57,040
Yeah, yarn.io.

914
00:45:57,040 --> 00:45:58,040
That's what he's doing.

915
00:45:58,040 --> 00:45:59,040
That'd be cool if...

916
00:45:59,040 --> 00:46:00,440
That's what's so scary about that.

917
00:46:00,440 --> 00:46:03,880
Because that is true that a lion's greatest weakness is yarn and it's the only thing that's

918
00:46:03,880 --> 00:46:09,160
keeping him from destroying humanity yeah if the ape if apes gain intelligence and

919
00:46:09,160 --> 00:46:13,320
are about to take over and then they discover apps and they just are on their

920
00:46:13,320 --> 00:46:17,280
phone all day they can't take anything else app they discover Twitter playing

921
00:46:17,280 --> 00:46:22,440
slithery Oh for hours a day and their their eyes aren't adapted to screen so

922
00:46:22,440 --> 00:46:26,160
they all just make any of my followers do any of my followers in San Francisco

923
00:46:26,160 --> 00:46:29,840
know of a good banana place?

924
00:46:29,840 --> 00:46:43,080
Yeah. Can anybody recommend a good tree in Chicago? They all crash, they all join

925
00:46:43,080 --> 00:46:46,400
warzone and there's they crash it and they all kill themselves because they

926
00:46:46,400 --> 00:46:52,320
can't play. That's right. It's not meant for the monkey mind. Yeah. Yeah a

927
00:46:52,320 --> 00:46:58,120
monkey is running around warzone right now looking for a banana yeah yeah they

928
00:46:58,120 --> 00:47:02,600
see a banana clip on an ak-47 and freak out for a moment but alas they were

929
00:47:02,600 --> 00:47:06,920
wrong yeah hey I don't know if you guys I don't know if you other apes are

930
00:47:06,920 --> 00:47:12,760
noticing this but it seems that this guy has been flinging his poop at humans and

931
00:47:12,760 --> 00:47:18,760
to do that to humans is one thing but he's also doing it to other apes you

932
00:47:18,760 --> 00:47:22,480
know in the ape community has to support yeah it's not apps that destroy the ape

933
00:47:22,480 --> 00:47:30,440
the ape army it's social justice they all join Twitter and they discover like

934
00:47:30,440 --> 00:47:37,240
like woke let woke speak and they just yeah yeah they can't they can't fight

935
00:47:37,240 --> 00:47:43,200
anymore you think there's ape racism yeah like gorillas like think of like

936
00:47:43,200 --> 00:47:49,940
orangutans like as a orange yeah yeah he's a fat ass mother orange haired

937
00:47:49,940 --> 00:47:57,780
fatties they're the Irish that's true if you're gonna be racist against one kind

938
00:47:57,780 --> 00:48:07,140
of ape orangutan I mean I've been saying orangutan because of the the juice me too

939
00:48:07,140 --> 00:48:11,300
Orangutan is just a very stupid looking animal.

940
00:48:11,300 --> 00:48:12,140
- It's so cool. - Yeah, it's like

941
00:48:12,140 --> 00:48:14,340
lanky Kong. - No, if there was an animal

942
00:48:14,340 --> 00:48:16,620
that could do like real life magic,

943
00:48:16,620 --> 00:48:18,040
it would be an orangutan.

944
00:48:18,040 --> 00:48:20,540
- Why, what? - They just look like

945
00:48:20,540 --> 00:48:22,220
they could do magic. - Wait, oh.

946
00:48:22,220 --> 00:48:24,180
I think I'm thinking of, are they like the ones

947
00:48:24,180 --> 00:48:26,140
with the flat faces? - Yeah.

948
00:48:26,140 --> 00:48:27,420
- Oh, okay. - They look like mystical.

949
00:48:27,420 --> 00:48:28,540
- Yeah, no, I agree. - No, dude.

950
00:48:28,540 --> 00:48:29,940
- Yeah. - They look like they could

951
00:48:29,940 --> 00:48:31,780
wave their arm and a wall of energy would appear.

952
00:48:31,780 --> 00:48:36,180
- Orangutan, any sort of animal that has a face

953
00:48:36,180 --> 00:48:40,980
that you can drive like a steering wheel is a huge evolutionary disadvantage.

954
00:48:40,980 --> 00:48:41,980
True.

955
00:48:41,980 --> 00:48:43,220
Because you can, I mean...

956
00:48:43,220 --> 00:48:44,220
No, dude, the things that...

957
00:48:44,220 --> 00:48:47,740
If I was a gorilla, I would be making orangutans suck my dick all the time.

958
00:48:47,740 --> 00:48:51,300
Those frill, those handles on the side of the orangutan's face, they frill out like the

959
00:48:51,300 --> 00:48:53,740
dinosaur in Jurassic Park that goes like...

960
00:48:53,740 --> 00:48:54,740
Really?

961
00:48:54,740 --> 00:48:55,740
Yup, and they spit poison.

962
00:48:55,740 --> 00:48:56,740
That's not true.

963
00:48:56,740 --> 00:48:57,740
That's true.

964
00:48:57,740 --> 00:48:58,740
Orangutans do not.

965
00:48:58,740 --> 00:48:59,740
No, it's true.

966
00:48:59,740 --> 00:49:00,740
There's not a single ounce of poison.

967
00:49:00,740 --> 00:49:01,740
Caleb, tell Patrick it's true.

968
00:49:01,740 --> 00:49:03,740
Patrick, that's true.

969
00:49:03,740 --> 00:49:05,220
I just heard that it wasn't.

970
00:49:05,220 --> 00:49:06,980
- You're not gonna trick me.

971
00:49:06,980 --> 00:49:07,820
- Dude, it is.

972
00:49:07,820 --> 00:49:08,640
- From Cameron.

973
00:49:08,640 --> 00:49:10,660
- Did you know orangutans could fly?

974
00:49:10,660 --> 00:49:13,340
- Yeah, they extend their faces so far out

975
00:49:13,340 --> 00:49:14,820
that they're like wings and they flap them

976
00:49:14,820 --> 00:49:15,660
as if they are angels.

977
00:49:15,660 --> 00:49:16,500
- Have you heard of wings?

978
00:49:16,500 --> 00:49:17,940
- I'm not looking it up.

979
00:49:17,940 --> 00:49:18,780
I'm not looking it up.

980
00:49:18,780 --> 00:49:19,600
- You're not looking up what a wing is?

981
00:49:19,600 --> 00:49:22,380
It's kind of like an arm with big flaps on it

982
00:49:22,380 --> 00:49:23,220
you can use to fly.

983
00:49:23,220 --> 00:49:27,340
- I don't, I know that this isn't true.

984
00:49:27,340 --> 00:49:28,540
- It is true.

985
00:49:28,540 --> 00:49:30,140
- It's a trick from you.

986
00:49:30,140 --> 00:49:31,260
- No.

987
00:49:31,260 --> 00:49:32,140
- You're tricking me.

988
00:49:32,140 --> 00:49:33,300
- No, dude, I'm being serious.

989
00:49:33,300 --> 00:49:34,140
- You're trying, there's a monkey.

990
00:49:34,140 --> 00:49:35,540
- Scientifically-- - There's a monkey with wings.

991
00:49:35,540 --> 00:49:38,340
- Scientifically, they've determined that orangutans

992
00:49:38,340 --> 00:49:40,020
are the sexiest animal.

993
00:49:40,020 --> 00:49:42,780
- Scientifically, they've determined that Patrick is a monkey.

994
00:49:42,780 --> 00:49:43,860
- No, they haven't!

995
00:49:43,860 --> 00:49:45,020
No, they haven't. - Patrick Fitzpatrick--

996
00:49:45,020 --> 00:49:46,220
- If anybody's a monkey on this podcast--

997
00:49:46,220 --> 00:49:47,900
- And this is true, folks. - It's Caleb.

998
00:49:47,900 --> 00:49:48,860
- This is true, folks. - That's true, yeah.

999
00:49:48,860 --> 00:49:49,700
- No, it's not true. - You're the chimp.

1000
00:49:49,700 --> 00:49:51,460
- I'm too smart to be a monkey. - You're a chimp.

1001
00:49:51,460 --> 00:49:52,420
- Not a chimp. - You're a chimp.

1002
00:49:52,420 --> 00:49:54,220
You're a white chimp.

1003
00:49:54,220 --> 00:49:55,500
- Yeah, what-- - Just because I can make

1004
00:49:55,500 --> 00:49:57,540
a perfect monkey face. - You look like an albino chimp.

1005
00:49:57,540 --> 00:49:59,060
- No, not albino.

1006
00:49:59,060 --> 00:50:00,500
You look like an albino chimp.

1007
00:50:00,500 --> 00:50:01,500
You're albino, dude.

1008
00:50:01,500 --> 00:50:02,500
No, just a normal...

00:50:02,500 --> 00:50:03,500
You're albino.

1010
00:50:03,500 --> 00:50:04,500
No, just a shaved chimp.

1011
00:50:04,500 --> 00:50:07,100
You look like if Edgar Winter was a chimp.

1012
00:50:07,100 --> 00:50:09,020
You look like if Edgar Wright was a chimp.

1013
00:50:09,020 --> 00:50:10,020
No.

1014
00:50:10,020 --> 00:50:12,220
You look like if Edgar Allan Poe was a chimp.

1015
00:50:12,220 --> 00:50:13,500
That's what Patrick looks like.

1016
00:50:13,500 --> 00:50:15,140
Honestly, Patrick does, yeah.

1017
00:50:15,140 --> 00:50:16,900
I don't look like Edgar Allan Poe at all.

1018
00:50:16,900 --> 00:50:17,900
You do.

1019
00:50:17,900 --> 00:50:18,900
You look exactly like him.

1020
00:50:18,900 --> 00:50:19,900
No, I don't.

1021
00:50:19,900 --> 00:50:22,020
You guys know that shitty statue in Boston?

00:50:22,020 --> 00:50:24,100
Anyone with bushy eyebrows, you guys say I look like.

1023
00:50:24,100 --> 00:50:25,100
Anyone with a bush?

1024

Yeah, anyone with a bush.

1025
00:50:26,100 --> 00:50:27,100
A huge bush.

1026
00:50:27,100 --> 00:50:28,420
Huge bush.

1027
00:50:28,420 --> 00:50:29,740

00:50:29,740 --> 00:50:30,580
Huge bush.

Yeah, the statue next to that skate spot.

1030
00:50:34,340 --> 00:50:35,940
The Statue of Liberty.

1031
00:50:35,940 --> 00:50:38,700
I don't know, I don't recognize it as a skate spot.

1032
00:50:38,700 --> 00:50:40,860
I recognize it as a P.F. Chang's.

1033
00:50:40,860 --> 00:50:41,700
Across the street.

1034
00:50:41,700 --> 00:50:42,860

1035
00:50:42,860 --> 00:50:44,820

1122
00:55:39,440 --> 00:55:40,280
- What?

1123
00:55:40,280 --> 00:55:41,100
- No, what that is.

1124
00:55:41,100 --> 00:55:44,180
It's a video, it's like some guy,

1125
00:55:44,180 --> 00:55:47,340
he's making his aunt's cooking stuff,

1126
00:55:47,340 --> 00:55:50,780
his aunt's recipes, but they're all like,

1127
00:55:50,780 --> 00:55:53,060
I don't know if they're like post,

1128
00:55:53,060 --> 00:55:55,380
they're all like 1950s recipes,

1129
00:55:55,380 --> 00:55:58,620
like you know those shitty cookbooks where it's like,

1130
00:55:58,620 --> 00:56:00,900
like when the refrigerator was a status symbol,

1131
00:56:00,900 --> 00:56:02,420
so they would just make just like things--

1132
00:56:02,420 --> 00:56:03,540
Still is.

1133
00:56:03,540 --> 00:56:04,380
Yeah.

1134
00:56:04,380 --> 00:56:06,420
That's the first thing, when people walk into my house,

1135
00:56:06,420 --> 00:56:07,500
it's the first thing I show 'em.

1136
00:56:07,500 --> 00:56:09,980
They notice my gold-plated refrigerator

1137
00:56:09,980 --> 00:56:11,460
with spinning rims.

1138
00:56:11,460 --> 00:56:12,300
- Yeah.

1139
00:56:12,300 --> 00:56:13,140
- We don't have a bathroom,

1140
00:56:13,140 --> 00:56:15,180
but check out this refrigerator.

1141
00:56:15,180 --> 00:56:17,140
- This fridge, it makes ice.

1142
00:56:17,140 --> 00:56:18,540
You just have to put it in a tray,

1143
00:56:18,540 --> 00:56:19,800
but you have to put the water in the tray,

1144
00:56:19,800 --> 00:56:20,780
but it makes ice.

1145
00:56:20,780 --> 00:56:22,020
- I'm not sure how it works.

1146
00:56:22,020 --> 00:56:23,680
I think temperature may be involved,

1147
00:56:23,680 --> 00:56:25,500
but it does make ice.

1148
00:56:25,500 --> 00:56:28,900
- But it's like, yeah, when people used to make Jell-O,

1149
00:56:28,900 --> 00:56:31,340
'cause it was like, oh, this proves that we have a fridge,

1150
00:56:31,340 --> 00:56:33,500
and it's like, she puts like,

1151
00:56:33,500 --> 00:56:36,280
it's like a bunch of cheese and a bunch of Cool Whip

1152
00:56:36,280 --> 00:56:38,140
and like celery,

1153
00:56:38,140 --> 00:56:42,640
And God, it's like a neon yellow.

1154
00:56:42,640 --> 00:56:44,820
- I miss when call out culture was when you told

1155
00:56:44,820 --> 00:56:46,980
your friend's wife that she doesn't have a fridge.

1156
00:56:46,980 --> 00:56:47,820
- Yeah.

1157
00:56:47,820 --> 00:56:49,580
(laughing)

1158
00:56:49,580 --> 00:56:52,380
- I know this Jell-O was made in the garage.

1159
00:56:52,380 --> 00:56:54,500
I know you don't have a fridge, you fucking bitch.

1160
00:56:54,500 --> 00:56:56,700
That's just a cardboard box.

1161
00:56:56,700 --> 00:56:58,100
- Yeah, you got an ice box.

1162
00:56:58,100 --> 00:57:00,580
- Yeah, you got an ice box, you don't got a fridge.

1163
00:57:00,580 --> 00:57:03,820
I don't even taste the Freon in this shit.

1164
00:57:03,820 --> 00:57:05,740
(laughing)

1165
00:57:05,740 --> 00:57:07,140
- Trust me, I would know.

1166
00:57:07,140 --> 00:57:10,420
Oh, trust me, I know what Freon tastes like.

1167
00:57:10,420 --> 00:57:13,180
Yeah, plus all the stuff in the Jell-O's hot stuff.

1168
00:57:13,180 --> 00:57:17,300
Yeah, it's not even jiggling, it's just wet.

1169
00:57:17,300 --> 00:57:20,840
Put meatballs in the Jell-O, they're still hot.

1170
00:57:20,840 --> 00:57:24,900
What's that, it's called like an ass pick, right?

1171
00:57:24,900 --> 00:57:26,780
Yeah, the thing that you use every night?

1172
00:57:26,780 --> 00:57:27,620
Yeah.

1173
00:57:27,620 --> 00:57:29,060
Yeah, it is called an ass pick.

1174
00:57:29,060 --> 00:57:29,900
Yeah.

1175
00:57:29,900 --> 00:57:31,980
It's what I use every night.

1176
00:57:31,980 --> 00:57:34,940
I'm gonna give you an ass pick lobotomy, buddy.

1177
00:57:34,940 --> 00:57:35,940
Yeah.

1178
00:57:35,940 --> 00:57:36,780
Yeah.

1179
00:57:36,780 --> 00:57:39,580
I'm gonna give you an ass pick lobotomy.

1180
00:57:39,580 --> 00:57:40,420
- Lobotomy.

1181
00:57:40,420 --> 00:57:41,620
- Low but-tomy.

1182
00:57:41,620 --> 00:57:43,220
- Low butt in me.

1183
00:57:43,220 --> 00:57:45,260
- Yeah, I'm gonna put your low butt in me.

1184
00:57:45,260 --> 00:57:46,180
- Yeah.

1185
00:57:46,180 --> 00:57:47,740
- And I'm gonna give you an ass pick.

1186
00:57:47,740 --> 00:57:49,380
- Ass pick low butt in me.

1187
00:57:49,380 --> 00:57:51,460
- I'm gonna give you a toothpick lobotomy.

1188
00:57:51,460 --> 00:57:52,900
- That's harder.

1189
00:57:52,900 --> 00:57:53,720
- I'ma just--

1190
00:57:53,720 --> 00:57:54,980
- It's easy for me.

1191
00:57:54,980 --> 00:57:57,700
- That's easy for Cameron 'cause he has tiny hands.

1192
00:57:57,700 --> 00:57:58,540
- No.

1193
00:57:58,540 --> 00:57:59,780
- Cameron does it accidentally every time

1194
00:57:59,780 --> 00:58:01,300
he tries to use a toothpick.

1195
00:58:01,300 --> 00:58:02,140
- Yeah.

1196
00:58:02,140 --> 00:58:03,660
- No, he accidentally pokes himself in the eye

1197
00:58:03,660 --> 00:58:04,620
each and every time.

1198
00:58:04,620 --> 00:58:06,780
Cameron has little hands and he's orange.

1199
00:58:06,780 --> 00:58:08,780
I keep losing toothpicks in my eye.

1200
00:58:08,780 --> 00:58:13,620
The lobotomies are so fun- that's so funny that they did that.

1201
00:58:13,620 --> 00:58:15,260
It's so crazy dude.

1202
00:58:15,260 --> 00:58:17,340
They were just like "Oh we finally cured girls."

1203
00:58:17,340 --> 00:58:21,900
Oh you stick a knife in their skull.

1204
00:58:21,900 --> 00:58:25,380
And you turn off their brain.

1205
00:58:25,380 --> 00:58:28,620
It's the fucking sim card release button.

1206
00:58:28,620 --> 00:58:30,860
(laughing)

1207
00:58:30,860 --> 00:58:35,180
- Except you removed the SIM card.

1208
00:58:35,180 --> 00:58:39,260
Yeah, it is funny that they named the,

1209
00:58:39,260 --> 00:58:43,300
it's the Rose F. Kennedy Greenway or whatever in Boston.

1210
00:58:43,300 --> 00:58:44,700
They named it after the one that got lobotomized.

1211
00:58:44,700 --> 00:58:46,020
- Oh yeah, they named it after her

1212
00:58:46,020 --> 00:58:47,780
'cause she got the lobotomy.

1213
00:58:47,780 --> 00:58:49,740
- Yeah, I don't know if that's why they named it after her.

1214
00:58:49,740 --> 00:58:50,660
- That's why they did.

1215
00:58:50,660 --> 00:58:51,900
- You know, maybe.

1216
00:58:51,900 --> 00:58:52,740
- Yeah.

1217
00:58:52,740 --> 00:58:54,340
- Where is that, the Greenway?

1218
00:58:54,340 --> 00:58:57,020
- It'd be funny if they forgot to plant all the flowers in it.

1219
00:58:57,020 --> 00:58:59,760
(laughing)

1220
00:58:59,760 --> 00:59:03,440
It's basically, it's like where all the big dig shit was.

1221
00:59:03,440 --> 00:59:05,520
Now they have a green way that is named

1222
00:59:05,520 --> 00:59:07,720
after the lobotomized Kennedy.

1223
00:59:07,720 --> 00:59:08,720
Damn, well I--

1224
00:59:08,720 --> 00:59:11,720
John F. Kennedy got lobotomized in a way.

1225
00:59:11,720 --> 00:59:12,560
Yeah, he did.

1226
00:59:12,560 --> 00:59:14,480
Yeah, in a way.

1227
00:59:14,480 --> 00:59:17,160
Yeah, it was the first bullet lobotomy.

1228
00:59:17,160 --> 00:59:19,120
The ultimate lobotomy.

1229
00:59:19,120 --> 00:59:20,680
Yeah, it didn't work so great.

1230
00:59:20,680 --> 00:59:21,960
It worked perfectly.

1231
00:59:21,960 --> 00:59:24,680
I mean, it stopped him from cheating on his wife, I guess.

1232
00:59:24,680 --> 00:59:25,800
Yeah.

1233
00:59:25,800 --> 00:59:26,640
Yeah.

1234
00:59:26,640 --> 00:59:28,400
That rocks.

1235
00:59:28,400 --> 00:59:29,640
It is funny that like the,

1236
00:59:29,640 --> 00:59:32,240
like something that women could be diagnosed with back then,

1237
00:59:32,240 --> 00:59:33,920
it was like being uppity.

1238
00:59:33,920 --> 00:59:35,560
Yeah, like hysteria.

1239
00:59:35,560 --> 00:59:36,680
Yeah.

1240
00:59:36,680 --> 00:59:37,520
So sick.

1241
00:59:37,520 --> 00:59:38,340
Dude, it was crazy.

1242
00:59:38,340 --> 00:59:40,080
It's just like she wants to go to college.

1243
00:59:40,080 --> 00:59:41,080
They cured it with the,

1244
00:59:41,080 --> 00:59:43,800
they were like, oh, we need to cure this hysteria

1245
00:59:43,800 --> 00:59:45,380
with a Hitachi wand.

1246
00:59:45,380 --> 00:59:47,040
(laughing)

1247
00:59:47,040 --> 00:59:47,880
Yeah.

1248
00:59:47,880 --> 00:59:48,720
Hold on.

1249
00:59:48,720 --> 00:59:49,540
Wait, you want it?

1250
00:59:49,540 --> 00:59:50,380
Yeah, you want a job?

1251
00:59:50,380 --> 00:59:52,440
Let me call in my samurai friend.

1252
00:59:52,440 --> 00:59:54,160
(laughing)

1253
00:59:54,160 --> 00:59:59,200
I'll forge his doctor's license and we'll get you fixed up real quick.

1254
00:59:59,200 --> 01:00:01,120
We're just gonna put you in a room for a while.

1255
01:00:01,120 --> 01:00:02,120
See what that does.

1256
01:00:02,120 --> 01:00:03,240
That was another thing that did.

1257
01:00:03,240 --> 01:00:05,240
A padded cell for the wife.

1258
01:00:05,240 --> 01:00:06,240
Yeah.

1259
01:00:06,240 --> 01:00:08,240
Yeah, this is called the work room.

1260
01:00:08,240 --> 01:00:12,000
There were like some people who made their wife go out in the shed while she was on her

1261
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:13,000
period or something.

1262
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:14,000
It was you, dude.

1263
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:15,000
Yeah, it was me.

1264
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:19,680
Or was that just a thing I heard in a sketch as a kid and then believed it is true?

1265
01:00:19,680 --> 01:00:22,680
Probably you heard that in a Mr. Show sketch and you believed it is true.

1266
01:00:22,680 --> 01:00:23,680
Yeah.

1267
01:00:23,680 --> 01:00:31,180
it's a white that's why I believe if I ask for change a man yeah to the

1268
01:00:31,180 --> 01:00:36,820
president of it yeah yeah yeah man I was watching the first that's also it's also

1269
01:00:36,820 --> 01:00:42,420
I think half of the people I meet in my life for David cross yeah even even the

1270
01:00:42,420 --> 01:00:47,260
even like people I was gonna make a joke about I feel I don't know I feel like

1271
01:00:47,260 --> 01:00:51,020
those two the bucket that the sketch where he like puts his hand like on his

1272
01:00:51,020 --> 01:00:55,540
neck and talks like a black guy. Do you remember that one?

1273
01:00:55,540 --> 01:00:58,780
Yeah, say it. Of course, even black people, but I don't know. I don't think that was...

1274
01:00:58,780 --> 01:01:02,500
Yeah, even black people with my eyes are closed. Yeah, if they're... They always are

1275
01:01:02,500 --> 01:01:07,540
because I have sensitive blue eyes. Yeah. You have... I learned that recently.

1276
01:01:07,540 --> 01:01:11,020
Blue eyes are more sensitive to light, supposedly. You have, you have like

1277
01:01:11,020 --> 01:01:16,100
Bosmer eyes. No, I don't. Yeah, you do. No. He's got little Bosmer ears, too.

1278
01:01:16,100 --> 01:01:17,680
You're a baby Bosmer.

1279
01:01:17,680 --> 01:01:18,780
Yeah. No, I'm not.

1280
01:01:18,780 --> 01:01:19,620
You're a baby Bosmer.

1281
01:01:19,620 --> 01:01:21,580
You're a little baby New Year Bosmer.

1282
01:01:21,580 --> 01:01:22,420
No.

1283
01:01:22,420 --> 01:01:23,240
You're a little baby New Year Bosmer.

1284
01:01:23,240 --> 01:01:24,620
A baby New Year, do I look like I'm wearing a diaper

1285
01:01:24,620 --> 01:01:25,540
and holding a flag?

1286
01:01:25,540 --> 01:01:26,380
No.

1287
01:01:26,380 --> 01:01:29,120
I'm wearing Dickies and I'm holding a beer.

1288
01:01:29,120 --> 01:01:30,580
If you put a top hat on right now,

1289
01:01:30,580 --> 01:01:32,460
you look like baby New Year.

1290
01:01:32,460 --> 01:01:35,160
No, I'm baby brew here,

1291
01:01:35,160 --> 01:01:37,140
'cause I got a brew in my hand right here.

1292
01:01:37,140 --> 01:01:38,340
Babies don't drink beer.

1293
01:01:38,340 --> 01:01:39,580
Yeah, put that down.

1294
01:01:39,580 --> 01:01:41,500
Definitive proof I don't have a baby.

1295
01:01:41,500 --> 01:01:44,440
Yeah, you're drinking a bottle, all right.

1296
01:01:44,440 --> 01:01:45,660
You're drinking out of a bottle.

1297
01:01:45,660 --> 01:01:46,900
- Yeah, a bottle of Coors Light.

1298
01:01:46,900 --> 01:01:48,660
- No, no, a bottle of baby juice.

1299
01:01:48,660 --> 01:01:50,140
- Did you know that when--

1300
01:01:50,140 --> 01:01:51,660
- A bottle of mother's milk.

1301
01:01:51,660 --> 01:01:52,500
- Baby juice.

1302
01:01:52,500 --> 01:01:56,640
- You're drinking juicy juice.

1303
01:01:56,640 --> 01:01:57,480
- No.

1304
01:01:57,480 --> 01:01:58,660
- You got your Bosmer bottle, dude.

1305
01:01:58,660 --> 01:02:01,180
- I'm not drinking any NuNu, I'll have you know.

1306
01:02:01,180 --> 01:02:02,340
- Yeah, you're drinking NuNu.

1307
01:02:02,340 --> 01:02:03,820
You're drinking Pedialyte.

1308
01:02:03,820 --> 01:02:04,660
- No.

1309
01:02:04,660 --> 01:02:06,020
- You're drinking Pedialyte 'cause you're a baby

1310
01:02:06,020 --> 01:02:07,420
and you need to make shit.

1311
01:02:07,420 --> 01:02:09,860
- You're drinking a poop smoothie.

1312
01:02:09,860 --> 01:02:11,780
- You're drinking Pedolite.

1313
01:02:11,780 --> 01:02:13,440
- You're drinking Pepsi Baby.

1314
01:02:14,340 --> 01:02:16,720
(laughing)

1315
01:02:16,720 --> 01:02:18,300
- Bud, you're drinking Pibb Cosby.

1316
01:02:18,300 --> 01:02:19,140
I can tell you that right now.

1317
01:02:19,140 --> 01:02:19,980
- I'm not, no.

1318
01:02:19,980 --> 01:02:21,520
- You're drinking Pibb Cosby.

1319
01:02:21,520 --> 01:02:23,920
- Dr. Pibb Cosby to you, buddy.

1320
01:02:23,920 --> 01:02:26,080
- Yeah, Dr. Pibb Cosby.

1321
01:02:26,080 --> 01:02:29,320
- The honorary Dr. Pibb Cosby.

1322
01:02:29,320 --> 01:02:33,300
He got an honorary doctorate from somewhere.

1323
01:02:33,300 --> 01:02:34,480
- From Temple, right?

1324
01:02:34,480 --> 01:02:36,380
- And I think we should give him another one.

1325
01:02:36,380 --> 01:02:37,980
Bill Cosby, if you're listening,

1326
01:02:37,980 --> 01:02:41,520
you have an honorary doctorate from the University of--

1327
01:02:41,520 --> 01:02:43,260
- From the Viper Biglia Institute.

1328
01:02:43,260 --> 01:02:45,520
(laughter)

1329
01:02:45,520 --> 01:02:48,740
- Yeah, from the Mike Birbiglia Technical Institute

1330
01:02:48,740 --> 01:02:50,340
of Secaucus.

1331
01:02:50,340 --> 01:02:53,400
- That would be really funny if it did get legally,

1332
01:02:53,400 --> 01:02:57,360
like, we created an institution called

1333
01:02:57,360 --> 01:02:59,060
the Mike Birbiglia Institute,

1334
01:02:59,060 --> 01:03:04,060
and the first thing we do is give Gil Cosby another duck,

1335
01:03:04,060 --> 01:03:05,900
and it's just him just being like,

1336
01:03:05,900 --> 01:03:07,740
"Hey, I don't wanna do that!"

1337
01:03:07,740 --> 01:03:09,980
(laughter)

1338
01:03:12,460 --> 01:03:13,460
Alright.

1339
01:03:13,460 --> 01:03:14,460
Yeah, that's an hour.

1340
01:03:14,460 --> 01:03:15,460
Alright.

1341
01:03:15,460 --> 01:03:19,460
Um, episode 100 coming soon.

1342
01:03:19,460 --> 01:03:22,460
Coming soon, something very special, very particular, very tricky, crazy.

1343
01:03:22,460 --> 01:03:24,460
You better finish your plan.

1344
01:03:24,460 --> 01:03:28,460
Finish your part of the editing, Caleb, because my part's going to take a long ass time.

1345
01:03:28,460 --> 01:03:30,460
I'm going to put my gun in your ass.

1346
01:03:30,460 --> 01:03:33,460
I'm going to reflect it using my solid ass wall.

1347
01:03:33,460 --> 01:03:35,460
He's going to stick your gunch.

1348
01:03:35,460 --> 01:03:36,460
I hate it when you do that.
