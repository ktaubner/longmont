[Music]

2
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Last time on Trebuchet Village, the gang accepted the quest of the mudmen to go slay the beast.

3
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:31,640
Patrick Yodar used his survival skills from cosplaying as a poor person to track the beast,

4
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:38,280
and on their way, they ran into a hunter, Goofus Tiedrich, who attempted to kidnap Prince Jumanji.

5
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:46,440
But Dogen's magical dirt pouch and Patrick Yodar's keen eyes led to the boy's rescue.

6
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:53,080
The gang then set upon Goofus, beating him so badly that they forced information out of him,

7
00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:59,000
learning about something called the Brave Lions, a notorious band of scaredy cats, elves, humans,

8
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:04,440
dwarves, and the like, who have banded together to take down the terrifier kingdom,

9
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:08,360
claiming that the normalization efforts by King Nardwuar are too little too late.

10
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:14,600
Goofus was hired as a bounty hunter to kill the young Nardboy, or capture him, and so that our

11
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:19,480
heroes would spare his life, he led them to the White Woman of the Woods as well, who lives in

12
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:25,100
the pond further south. Upon meeting the white woman, Dogen jammed a javelin inside of Goof

13
00:01:25,100 --> 00:01:32,900
as far enough that it killed him. The white woman of the woods is a goodly spirit who

14
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:39,340
wishes to banish the jester and his terrible reign over the whippet woods, especially the

15
00:01:39,340 --> 00:01:46,940
kitsunes who worship him and enslave her precious kugler elves. The jester made all of the creatures

16
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:53,220
and plants weird and angry, like something out of Nightmare Before Christians.

17
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:57,220
When the whip it was, it used to be normal, used to not make people laugh uncontrollably

18
00:01:57,220 --> 00:02:01,260
or have fucked up plants that try to kill you.

19
00:02:01,260 --> 00:02:05,820
The White Woman of Wood says that the Yoni Egg of Baskin, an ancient and powerful artifact,

20
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:10,980
was stolen from her during the Great War long ago between the Terrifier and the police,

21
00:02:10,980 --> 00:02:13,740
which led to the Jester's rise in power.

22
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:19,420
Now it is possessed by the vile warlock Connoria, who serves the jester in the woods, cursing

23
00:02:19,420 --> 00:02:22,560
its creatures with weirdness and laughter.

24
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:28,020
The white woman promises to help the boys get out of the woods and more if they are able

25
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:29,620
to return her yoni egg.

26
00:02:29,620 --> 00:02:33,220
Perhaps they can avenge the mudmen as well and even find the beast captured by the kitsune

27
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:34,220
people.

28
00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:35,740
Who knows.

29
00:02:35,740 --> 00:02:42,460
After some words were exchanged about Trunchbull Yodar having sex with the white woman in the

30
00:02:42,460 --> 00:02:47,100
woods while Patrick Yodar watched and spilled juicy juice. The gang headed back

31
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:54,420
out into the night. Whereupon, resting at a campsite and after being attacked by

32
00:02:54,420 --> 00:02:58,220
teleporting monkeys, they were visited by a handsome cowboy who tried to lull them

33
00:02:58,220 --> 00:03:02,620
to sleep. However, steadfast Dogen would not take his dirt nap so easily and

34
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:08,000
batted away the bastard with his trusty shovel. Now fully on edge, or he

35
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,060
clotheslined him? I'll have to re-listen to that part. Now fully on edge, the group tried their

36
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:15,660
best to get a good night's sleep and in the morning made their way to Connoria's

37
00:03:15,660 --> 00:03:20,860
disgusting hovel he lives in like the nasty warlock he is. He seemed to be

38
00:03:20,860 --> 00:03:24,460
speaking with the Jester who scared the crap out of everyone and offered them a

39
00:03:24,460 --> 00:03:28,300
chance to serve him in the woods, find their own way out, or continue on their

40
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:32,580
foolish errand at their own risk. They chose option three and the Jester

41
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:37,180
seemingly possessed the body of Connoria, held the yoni egg of Baskin Skyward and

42
00:03:37,180 --> 00:03:41,260
beckoned them to fight. Will our heroes be able to beat the Jester and restore

43
00:03:41,260 --> 00:03:45,740
the whip it woods to being normal well Patrick Yodar find a five-star hotel

44
00:03:45,740 --> 00:03:50,300
will Sullivan ever get a good night's sleep is the prince really safe with

45
00:03:50,300 --> 00:04:01,580
these boys I don't know it's improv you stupid bitch so yeah I can tell you're

46
00:04:01,580 --> 00:04:16,460
excited for this yeah it's gonna be sick ass I just fucked up the I spent time on

47
00:04:16,460 --> 00:04:22,700
everything but the intro this time the intro all right then I'm excited let's

48
00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:28,940
go it's gonna be good we already roll initiatives no no I mean also like if

49
00:04:28,940 --> 00:04:32,140
you did unless I wrote them down because we were all together when we did that so

50
00:04:32,140 --> 00:04:39,300
unless I wrote them down doesn't count so everyone roll initiative. I got

51
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:47,060
an 11. I got a crit one. I got a two. Can we roll it again that doesn't count? What?

52
00:04:47,060 --> 00:04:52,220
No it all counts. What do you have? I'm trying to look out for my two boys here.

53
00:04:52,220 --> 00:04:57,700
No, it can't we've lost already. So my character commits suicide

54
00:04:57,700 --> 00:05:05,180
Well, actually if you want to do that, hey badges all of us commit suicide

55
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:15,020
I'm gonna pull out my ghost campaign book

56
00:05:18,820 --> 00:05:22,580
for that. I knew I'd make something so bad. Everyone would

57
00:05:22,580 --> 00:05:24,980
quit.

58
00:05:24,980 --> 00:05:37,780
So we got an eleven. It's Patrick we got. Dogen with a two

59
00:05:37,780 --> 00:05:41,940
we got crit one right. So yeah, I count crits for initiative.

60
00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:45,140
Some people don't do that. I like it. It's funny and then

61
00:05:45,140 --> 00:05:47,540
What'd you get, Evil Steeble?

62
00:05:47,540 --> 00:05:49,580
You got a soft two.

63
00:05:49,580 --> 00:05:51,060
- A normal two. - Yeah.

64
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:52,260
- He's got a soft two.

65
00:05:52,260 --> 00:05:56,020
- Soft two, that's not that unimpressive.

66
00:05:56,020 --> 00:05:58,220
- A hard one. - No.

67
00:05:58,220 --> 00:05:59,420
Doesn't even make sense.

68
00:05:59,420 --> 00:06:00,900
- I know.

69
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:02,060
- And then, okay. - That's so weird.

70
00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:03,980
- Creepy. - Let's see what happens

71
00:06:03,980 --> 00:06:06,060
with our friend Conneria.

72
00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:09,820
Okay, what is that?

73
00:06:09,820 --> 00:06:10,660
Okay.

74
00:06:10,660 --> 00:06:12,580
Oh boy.

75
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:14,860
And...

76
00:06:14,860 --> 00:06:21,860
And another friend, Sullivan, the frog.

77
00:06:21,860 --> 00:06:24,860
All right, Sullivan, how you living?

78
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:26,860
How you doing, man?

79
00:06:26,860 --> 00:06:28,860
How you gonna do on this initiative roll?

80
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:30,860
You gonna slay it?

81
00:06:30,860 --> 00:06:32,860
He got a 20. He's the best.

82
00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:34,860
Damn, he's good.

83
00:06:34,860 --> 00:06:36,860
Okay.

84
00:06:36,860 --> 00:06:38,860
Sullivan goes first, believe it or not.

85
00:06:38,860 --> 00:06:43,860
So, Connery is this warlock, and I mean, from what you can tell,

86
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:53,100
It seems like he's either possessed by the power of the jester or it's hard to gather

87
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:54,540
that right away.

88
00:06:54,540 --> 00:06:55,740
But he's holding a Yoni Egiloft.

89
00:06:55,740 --> 00:06:58,300
Looks like he's ready to cast something.

90
00:06:58,300 --> 00:07:05,860
But before that, Sulvin gets a jump on him and thankfully with that long rest, he's going

91
00:07:05,860 --> 00:07:07,020
to be able to cast Faerie Fire.

92
00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:11,940
So he's going to try to cast Faerie Fire on this bastard jester.

93
00:07:11,940 --> 00:07:12,940
So let's see.

94
00:07:12,940 --> 00:07:18,140
Dex saving throw and the dexterity of our friend here is

95
00:07:18,140 --> 00:07:21,100
not not terrible. Unfortunately for Sullivan. So let's see how

96
00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:30,700
it goes. Oh boy. Holy **** he **** up so Sullivan the frog

97
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:34,380
gets a jump on this guy and this guy Connery. He's like

98
00:07:34,380 --> 00:07:36,700
sort of like saying his whatever thing he said at the

99
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:39,820
very end of the episode. I don't remember exactly what I

100
00:07:39,820 --> 00:07:47,340
said but and as he's saying it's all then it was a ha ha and holds aloft his loot

101
00:07:47,340 --> 00:07:53,420
and strums a terrible chord but it shoots out this like bluish amber like

102
00:07:53,420 --> 00:07:59,020
translucent fire that wraps itself around Connery a who is now as long as

103
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:03,180
Sullivan maintains concentration you know all now have advantage on any attack

104
00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:12,100
against him. Dude, yes. Yeah. Keep concentrating. Alright, here I go. He's just like scrunching

105
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:18,160
his eyes a little harder. I can tell you're faking. Can you try harder than that? I really

106
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:24,860
don't believe that you're... Stick your tongue out like Michael Jordan. Yeah, stick your tongue

107
00:08:24,860 --> 00:08:36,740
out Sullivan. You look so stupid now. You do look kind of stupid. You do look like a fool.

108
00:08:36,740 --> 00:08:42,940
Do I put the tongue back in? Hey, you do whatever you want. I'm not. Okay, I'm gonna put the

109
00:08:42,940 --> 00:08:47,020
tongue back in. Yeah, all right. Well, if you're gonna do that, that's fine. My forehead

110
00:08:47,020 --> 00:08:48,020
hurts.

111
00:08:48,020 --> 00:08:50,220
I don't understand why you're doing that.

112
00:08:50,220 --> 00:08:51,220
That's good.

113
00:08:51,220 --> 00:08:52,220
Keep concentrating.

114
00:08:52,220 --> 00:08:58,540
And so, out of the, let's see now.

115
00:08:58,540 --> 00:09:06,620
So yeah, evil Steve, as you're shouting, keep concentrating.

116
00:09:06,620 --> 00:09:11,140
I'm going to need you to roll a dexterity saving throw.

117
00:09:11,140 --> 00:09:12,660
All right.

118
00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:14,420
It's too easy.

119
00:09:14,420 --> 00:09:15,420
All right.

120
00:09:15,420 --> 00:09:16,420
It's a six.

121
00:09:16,420 --> 00:09:18,420
That's gotta be pretty bad, right?

122
00:09:18,420 --> 00:09:24,020
Yeah, it's not good. So what happens is, is rustling in the trees above, you hear the

123
00:09:24,020 --> 00:09:36,980
familiar gentle voice of the, of a singing voice of a cowboy. And you hear him as he's

124
00:09:36,980 --> 00:09:44,820
like saying, "I'm gonna get you." And he just jumps out of the trees, grabs onto your head,

125
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:49,940
evil Steve-o and he turns into some sort of like awful looking ugly changeling

126
00:09:49,940 --> 00:09:54,180
and he is just like grabbing at your head so this is the changeling that

127
00:09:54,180 --> 00:10:06,300
belongs to Conneria. Get off my damn head! And he does... oh no. Get off! Yeah so he goes

128
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:11,500
in there he's just like he like like jumps down and just like starts grabbing

129
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:28,620
and

130
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:42,500
the

131
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:57,500
a

132
00:10:57,500 --> 00:11:02,460
name is Impy? I named it Impy, yes. That's the best you can come up with. Is that short

133
00:11:02,460 --> 00:11:10,620
for something? I don't know. It's short for impressive hair on Stevel's head. I really

134
00:11:10,620 --> 00:11:16,060
named it that ahead of time. That's really impressive. I knew. I had a crystal ball.

135
00:11:16,060 --> 00:11:20,580
He's got a crystal ball now. That's good news. So now we know when we kill him and loot him

136
00:11:20,580 --> 00:11:21,840
we'll find a crystal ball.

137
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:22,680
- No, no, no.

138
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:24,800
- You won't be getting added to our inventory.

139
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:25,640
- No.

140
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:27,440
- That is exactly, that is exactly what happened.

141
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:29,920
- Am I not allowed to riff in character?

142
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:30,960
(laughing)

143
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:32,000
Is that just what it is?

144
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,240
You'll take advantage?

145
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:36,280
- Not unless, uh...

146
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:37,120
- I'm using details that have been established?

147
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:40,600
- Not unless, okay, that's right.

148
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:41,440
- Look, I'm a...

149
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:42,800
- That'll show him.

150
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:43,640
Not unless.

151
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:45,320
- I need to go get a glass of water.

152
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:46,160
I'm very thirsty.

153
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:48,720
(laughing)

154
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:52,720
very warm in my room in the game.

155
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:54,720
Do you want to get a glass of water Pat?

156
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:56,720
I'm fine, I'll wait.

157
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:58,720
Just looking out for you buddy.

158
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:00,720
NEMO!

159
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,720
(laughter)

160
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:04,720
Okay.

161
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:06,720
So,

162
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:08,720
Conneria,

163
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:10,720
I think he said stop.

164
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:12,720
I don't know.

165
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:14,720
I would say that too

166
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:16,720
if you did that to me every time you recorded.

167
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:28,280
you recorded. Alright, I want to kill this Conneria bastard. And I want to take his crystal

168
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:35,360
ball. I want to see the future. If we look into it and we see something that doesn't

169
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:40,720
eventually happen, we're cancelling the campaign. Can you guys believe these players? Fine,

170
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:47,680
I kill myself Pat these players are you done drive me crazy as the DM don't kill yourself

171
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:51,500
Please that will be hard to deal with I will think I think this

172
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:54,720
It is it is such a good

173
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:57,860
Such a good thing. You can always use on me

174
00:12:57,860 --> 00:13:06,400
You can quote patches on that it's such a suicide such a good no, I saw the Bo Burnham special

175
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:15,880
Tell the kids at home it works on your parents too.

176
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:26,160
So he, Conneria, who's been frozen in time, unfreezes and shoots out a like, like it looks

177
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:30,640
like almost like a heavy bolt of electricity like it has this weight to it and it shoots

178
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:41,000
out towards you Patrick Jodar since you're sort of the most conspicuous right now because

179
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:45,240
of your giant balls and he's going to try to attack you.

180
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:46,560
You better not touch these.

181
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:49,880
I'm going to say that right now.

182
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:52,560
I can see your line of sight is looking straight at my balls.

183
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:56,040
My eyes are up here.

184
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:57,040
What's your AC?

185
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:59,040
My AC is

186
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:00,840
14

187
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:02,120
All right

188
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:03,200
so

189
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:05,920
the bolt you feel alike

190
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:17,180
He's gonna torment you for the rest of the episode

191
00:14:17,180 --> 00:14:19,180
*laughing*

192
00:14:19,180 --> 00:14:21,180
You deserve it!

193
00:14:21,180 --> 00:14:23,180
He dropped all my skateboards!

194
00:14:23,180 --> 00:14:25,180
*laughing*

195
00:14:25,180 --> 00:14:27,180
*laughing*

196
00:14:27,180 --> 00:14:29,180
He walked in and he opened the door and hit all my skateboards!

197
00:14:29,180 --> 00:14:31,180
*laughing*

198
00:14:31,180 --> 00:14:33,180
*laughing*

199
00:14:33,180 --> 00:14:35,180
That's what you deserve.

200
00:14:35,180 --> 00:14:37,180
*laughing*

201
00:14:37,180 --> 00:14:39,180
Okay, what was happening?

202
00:14:39,180 --> 00:14:41,180
Your balls are getting electrocuted, Pat.

203
00:14:41,180 --> 00:14:43,180
That sucks, I hate that so much.

204
00:14:43,180 --> 00:14:45,180
Uh, so...

205
00:14:45,180 --> 00:14:46,380
You'd scream.

206
00:14:46,380 --> 00:14:47,380
Ouch.

207
00:14:47,380 --> 00:14:50,980
Well, you're about to take some serious frickin' damage.

208
00:14:50,980 --> 00:14:52,780
So you're gonna start.

209
00:14:52,780 --> 00:14:58,780
Hopefully not serious, we'll see.

210
00:14:58,780 --> 00:14:59,780
How much?

211
00:14:59,780 --> 00:15:00,780
Twelve.

212
00:15:00,780 --> 00:15:01,780
I'm dead.

213
00:15:01,780 --> 00:15:02,780
Yeah.

214
00:15:02,780 --> 00:15:08,700
You fucking got one hit on your balls, dude.

215
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:10,060
They're a blessing and a curse.

216
00:15:10,060 --> 00:15:12,780
Dude, kill yourself before it hits.

217
00:15:12,780 --> 00:15:13,280
*sneeze*

218
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:13,780
*sneeze*

219
00:15:13,780 --> 00:15:14,280
*sneeze*

220
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:14,780
*sneeze*

221
00:15:14,780 --> 00:15:15,280
*sneeze*

222
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:15,780
*sneeze*

223
00:15:15,780 --> 00:15:16,280
*sneeze*

224
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:16,780
*sneeze*

225
00:15:16,780 --> 00:15:17,280
*sneeze*

226
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:17,780
*sneeze*

227
00:15:17,780 --> 00:15:18,280
*sneeze*

228
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:18,780
*sneeze*

229
00:15:18,780 --> 00:15:19,280
*sneeze*

230
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:19,780
*sneeze*

231
00:15:19,780 --> 00:15:20,280
*sneeze*

232
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:20,780
*sneeze*

233
00:15:20,780 --> 00:15:21,280
*sneeze*

234
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:21,780
*sneeze*

235
00:15:21,780 --> 00:15:22,280
*sneeze*

236
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:22,780
*sneeze*

237
00:15:22,780 --> 00:15:23,280
*sneeze*

238
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:23,780
*sneeze*

239
00:15:23,780 --> 00:15:24,280
*sneeze*

240
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:24,780
*sneeze*

241
00:15:24,780 --> 00:15:25,280
*sneeze*

242
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:25,780
*sneeze*

243
00:15:25,780 --> 00:15:26,280
*sneeze*

244
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:26,780
*sneeze*

245
00:15:26,780 --> 00:15:27,280
*sneeze*

246
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:27,780
*sneeze*

247
00:15:27,780 --> 00:15:28,280
*sneeze*

248
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:33,080
It does 12 damage, does the max amount of damage it can do at this level.

249
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:37,880
And it just, yeah, it just fucking like, electrocutes you.

250
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:39,880
And you're just out cold.

251
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:40,880
Dude.

252
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:43,880
This sucks. I don't like this.

253
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:46,880
Yeah, you're out cold.

254
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:47,880
Ouch.

255
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:50,880
That is probably how Al-Analda's gonna go.

256
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:54,880
I hurt so bad.

257
00:15:54,880 --> 00:16:01,880
And it is now Evil Stevel's turn because Patrick Yodar is out cold.

258
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:04,880
Okay, so I still have the hair on my head, yeah?

259
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:05,880
Mm-hmm.

260
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:13,880
Um, Cam, what do you think? Should I attack the Imp or should I fight Knoria?

261
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:14,880
Knoria!

262
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:15,880
Yeah.

263
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:19,880
I'm Knoria, from the Knoria tribe.

264
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:23,880
I tried to be medieval sounding.

265
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:24,880
I don't know.

266
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:25,880
I don't know.

267
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:26,880
I uh, I guess.

268
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:32,520
Well with some help you turned out to be, I'm gonna use Ray of Sickness on Konoria.

269
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:34,920
You had Ray of Sickness this whole time?

270
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:36,600
You held off on that for three episodes?

271
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:38,800
That sounds so cool.

272
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:41,240
It does a lot of damage if it hits.

273
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:43,040
It's a good spell.

274
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:44,040
It's a solid spell.

275
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:45,040
Alright, go for it, Doug.

276
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:46,640
Alright, here I go.

277
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:47,640
Ray of Sickness.

278
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:48,640
Eleven.

279
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:53,640
11. Alright, and that is on Connoria.

280
00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:58,640
Or Connoria. And, uh...

281
00:16:58,640 --> 00:17:03,640
Where's his AC? Ah, it's not quite enough to hit him. I'm gonna fucking die, dude.

282
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:08,640
We're all dead. Fucking three episodes in. He just shoots...

283
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:13,640
Yeah, we could just try again. We're always better than ten episodes in.

284
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:15,640
That's a good point, I guess. Just start again.

285
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:16,640
Hell yeah.

286
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:20,640
So you shoot this ray of sickness, which I like to imagine is sort of just a green

287
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:22,640
- It's poop. - Cosmoses Jones. Poop.

288
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:25,640
I was gonna say it's some poop guy, but yeah, it's just poop.

289
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:27,640
You just basically, yeah, you throw a ray of sickness.

290
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:31,640
- It's a long poop that I... - It's a long poop that's sling from your...

291
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:34,640
Flies out of my hand, but like, it looks like magic at first,

292
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:38,640
but then you think, "Maybe I had a poop in my sleeve this entire time."

293
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:42,640
You see Cotterill like, "Oh, that looks like magic."

294
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:44,960
And as it gets closer, that's not that's

295
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:52,280
Anybody he's able to pretty deftly dodge out of the way it is now your turn Dogen

296
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:54,760
Okay

297
00:17:54,760 --> 00:18:01,240
Well, I'm not gonna try to attack. Oh, I'm sorry. You have advantage because he has fairy fire on him. Oh

298
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:05,440
Dude I'm really sorry

299
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:07,440
Well, fuck this guy!

300
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:09,440
[Laughter]

301
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:11,440
[Laughter]

302
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:13,440
The exact same rule.

303
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:15,440
Alright.

304
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:17,440
Okay, it's not my day.

305
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:19,440
It's the same rule.

306
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:21,440
Okay, sorry.

307
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:23,440
Alright, Togan, you're up.

308
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:25,440
Oh man, I was so happy for one second there.

309
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:27,440
[Laughter]

310
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:29,440
I'm not gonna attack

311
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:31,440
the guy on your head because

312
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:33,440
I think I might kill you by accident if I miss.

313
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:40,440
miss. So I'm gonna attack Conneria I think with my war hammer. Or my war shovel I should

314
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:49,080
say. Okay that's 8 but I have advantage. Hold on. It keeps popping up a sidebar so I can't

315
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:57,760
click it again. Yeah it's annoying. 11. The evil number. The most evil number. You made

316
00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:03,840
strong. He's it's a that's just he's his AC is not that high. I'm telling you now you could do it.

317
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:10,960
You could do it. We clearly can't do it. Yeah, you swing and a miss. He dodges the poop. You

318
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:15,760
charge at him like after the poop comes out, you know, sort of like in his blind spot with your

319
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:22,160
shovel and he's able to dodge that again pretty deftly. So we're back to the top of the order.

320
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:24,160
It is Mr. Sullivan the Frog's turn.

321
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:26,160
You better do work, Sullivan.

322
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:28,160
Okay.

323
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:34,160
And he looks up top to you.

324
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:46,160
He looks up to, sorry, he looks at Conneria and he gets his dagger out and he flings it towards the guy.

325
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:50,160
And let's see how he does.

326
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:52,160
That is just the damage.

327
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:54,160
Whoops.

328
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:56,160
That is... Why is that...

329
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:58,160
Why would that be crit?

330
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:00,160
He rolled a 12 crit.

331
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:02,160
But it looks like a crit.

332
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:04,160
What is this?

333
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:06,160
What happened to the UI here?

334
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:08,160
The user interface of Roll20 thinks that a 9 for Sullivan is crit.

335
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:10,160
Well let's just count it a crit then.

336
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:12,160
Yeah, that's a crit.

337
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:14,160
It's green.

338
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:16,160
There we go. Well don't worry, he got advantage anyway, so...

339
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:18,160
He did better. I guess Sullivan only does crits.

340
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:31,160
only

341
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:32,160
what is happening?

342
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:33,160
How is this?

343
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:34,160
What did I?

344
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:35,160
What did I roll?

345
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:37,440
20 could tell you were abusing us.

346
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:40,360
It has the mic detected too many suicide threats in a city.

347
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:42,080
I had some crits.

348
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:44,320
All right, Sullivan does.

349
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:47,640
Sullivan does not create, but Sullivan does do for damage on Connery.

350
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:53,480
So Sullivan pulling his goddamn weight sort of closes his eyes and throws the knife.

351
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:58,080
And after Connery, those two deaf dodges that knife just like gets in his thigh.

352
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:00,800
He's like, and yeah.

353
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:18,800
and

354
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:20,800
poofing it like a 50s bob haircut.

355
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:21,800
Okay.

356
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:22,800
Click on the side.

357
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:24,800
What's your AC?

358
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:26,800
Let me check.

359
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:28,800
I think it's not so bad, right?

360
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:29,800
It's like a hundred.

361
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:31,800
Yeah, he tries to claw at you again.

362
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:33,800
Um, uh,

363
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:35,800
and you're able to just like, uh,

364
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:37,800
deflect it with your shield, um,

365
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:39,800
or with your armor, whatever you use to

366
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:41,800
deflect. How do you deflect things?

367
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:43,800
Don't say you're like your ass or something.

368
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:44,800
My ass.

369
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:46,800
Ah, so he's...

370
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:49,040
(laughing)

371
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:50,900
- Yeah, you just-- - Oh, no, my shield!

372
00:21:50,900 --> 00:21:52,120
Oh, fuck, come on.

373
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:52,960
(laughing)

374
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:54,100
Oh, not my ass.

375
00:21:54,100 --> 00:21:56,960
- Yeah, you use your butt, you just deflect him.

376
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:59,380
So, yeah, that's kinda it for his turn,

377
00:21:59,380 --> 00:22:02,160
but now it's our, it's our, the villain--

378
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:04,760
- When do I get to do, like, death saves or whatever?

379
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:07,760
- After Konariya's turn, you will.

380
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:10,120
- I hate this fucking guy.

381
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:11,960
I hate him so fucking much. - Oh, actually,

382
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:12,800
you know what I realized?

383
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:13,960
I should've already let you do one.

384
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:15,120
So you wanna do one now? - Yeah.

385
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:16,480
- Yes. - Yeah, go for it.

386
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:17,480
What do I roll?

387
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:18,480
D20.

388
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:23,240
You actually, in your sheet, you should have a way to just click it.

389
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:25,440
In the D&D Beyond sheet.

390
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:27,440
Alright, where?

391
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:29,720
Up top.

392
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:34,240
If you lower your health to like zero on D&D Beyond, it'll show you death saves.

393
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:40,680
It says I got a, I did a custom roll.

394
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:43,880
Yeah, it's got an alert that you did a custom roll on my...

395
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:45,880
Yeah, well it was a 20.

396
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:47,880
Whoa, it was a 20.

397
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:50,880
Oh, it was a crit? Alright, so you get two successes.

398
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:51,880
Oh, sick.

399
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:56,880
So only one more on your turn and you'll be back stabilized.

400
00:22:56,880 --> 00:23:11,880
So, now it's Konaria's turn and he's going to shoot a blast of Eldritch Energy at you, Dogen, after you went after him.

401
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:13,880
So, let's see how he does

402
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:16,440
Choke

403
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:18,040
What's your AC?

404
00:23:18,040 --> 00:23:20,040
18. Yeah

405
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:27,800
Don't you don't do don't do that choker I started doing a Reggie Miller like this

406
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:33,200
Don't know don't don't tell me to choke

407
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:40,680
Yeah, and it's now Patrick Yodar roll for death save do a custom roll yeah

408
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:47,680
I got another 20. Is that how high it's custom? Is it custom so you only get 20?

409
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:50,680
You got a 16 and a 20. What are you doing?

410
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:52,680
I rolled again while I was waiting.

411
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:54,680
That's great. I mean, you're doing great.

412
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:56,680
They're both successful.

413
00:23:56,680 --> 00:24:00,680
Yeah, you're stabilized. So you're just like chilling at zero HP.

414
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:04,680
That was horrible. I don't want to do that again.

415
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:09,680
Yeah, so as soon as somebody heals you, you can get up and get back in the game.

416
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:12,760
Can one of you guys they just give me like a potion?

417
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:17,860
I mean I have a you have guys have the cookies you have the I have healing potions and cookies in my pocket

418
00:24:17,860 --> 00:24:20,360
But apparently I'm not allowed to touch them. Well, no

419
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:24,240

You're gonna be sitting here. I'm gonna be sitting here

422
00:24:30,940 --> 00:24:36,340

423
00:24:36,340 --> 00:24:38,600
(laughing)

424
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:41,940
- That makes me sound like Alan Alda.

425
00:24:41,940 --> 00:24:43,660
(laughing)

426
00:24:43,660 --> 00:24:44,820
- You're up,

427
00:24:44,820 --> 00:24:48,100
Evil Steeble.

428
00:24:48,100 --> 00:24:51,300
- Okay, I'm going to use

429
00:24:51,300 --> 00:24:54,460
Ray of Sickness on this dastardly imp.

430
00:24:54,460 --> 00:24:56,900
- Okay, docky.

431
00:24:56,900 --> 00:25:00,420

432
00:25:00,420 --> 00:25:01,620
- Oh, wow.

433
00:25:01,620 --> 00:25:03,100
- Please tell me that hits.

434
00:25:03,100 --> 00:25:04,100
- Yeah, that definitely hits.

435
00:25:04,100 --> 00:25:04,940
- Oh, nice.

436
00:25:04,940 --> 00:25:05,820
- You got a crit, dog.

437
00:25:05,820 --> 00:25:07,820
shooting it at your own head too?

438
00:25:07,820 --> 00:25:11,820

439
00:25:11,820 --> 00:25:15,820
alright so now roll for damage yeah?

440
00:25:15,820 --> 00:25:16,820
mhm

441
00:25:16,820 --> 00:25:17,820
8

442
00:25:17,820 --> 00:25:19,820
fuck yeah um oh and it makes a con save

443
00:25:19,820 --> 00:25:21,820
right it also will make a con save

444
00:25:21,820 --> 00:25:23,820
um

445
00:25:23,820 --> 00:25:25,820
cause uh if it if it on a failed save

446
00:25:25,820 --> 00:25:27,820
it'll also be poisoned so

447
00:25:27,820 --> 00:25:29,820
let's see how it does on constitution

448
00:25:29,820 --> 00:25:33,820
it fails the con save! it's fricken poisoned

449
00:25:33,820 --> 00:25:40,380
Poisoned as well. You badass bitch. Yeah, so you just like put your hands up wearing on on top of your head

450
00:25:40,380 --> 00:25:43,260
It just blast this guy off. He's like and

451
00:25:43,260 --> 00:25:46,580
It is now poisoned

452
00:25:46,580 --> 00:25:49,340
which in 5e is not like

453
00:25:49,340 --> 00:25:51,980
damage over time

454
00:25:51,980 --> 00:25:58,620
Which is what you would expect from like poison, but they have disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks, which is still pretty good

455
00:25:58,620 --> 00:26:01,620
so

456
00:26:01,620 --> 00:26:05,040
Yeah, so yeah, he's also not looking good by the way

457
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:08,240
This imp he's just he's not that strong

458
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:14,260
So he's sort of like wobbling and like vomiting because you hit him with this ray of sickness. So he's just vomiting up poop

459
00:26:14,260 --> 00:26:24,180
That's fucking disgusting go to the bathroom if you're gonna do that bullshit you see him like he's like a changeling

460
00:26:24,180 --> 00:26:29,980
He's like kind of changing between different forms as he's like sit falling ill like he looks like the cowboy again

461
00:26:29,980 --> 00:26:32,280
He looks like Marie Curie. He looks like

462
00:26:32,280 --> 00:26:37,100
He's just like shifting between all these different people Tony the tiger

463
00:26:37,100 --> 00:26:40,820
And now it is your turn Dogen

464
00:26:40,820 --> 00:26:47,380
Okay, do I still have advantage on on a test Sullivan's maintained? Yeah, I'm just gonna I'm just gonna swing again

18 so yeah, I will heal you when I when I finish doing the thing that you couldn't do you also have what you should know

468
00:27:05,100 --> 00:27:08,120
my man

469
00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:13,880
Dogen the dirt goblin you have um, oh, do you have divine smite yet or not yet? No, not yet

470
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:19,760
Oh, yeah, you'll get it. But I am gonna use fury of the small on this I think fuck. Yeah, I assume he's bigger than me

471
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:24,180
Yes. Yeah, Connery is a human. Okay. Yeah, so I do

472
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:30,300
Nine damage fuck. Yeah, so you um, yeah, how do you hit him? What do you do?

473
00:27:30,300 --> 00:27:32,820
this shovel

474
00:27:32,820 --> 00:27:34,180
God

475
00:27:34,180 --> 00:27:39,540
I don't know dude. I'd sit him with the shovel. Damn. All right, so you hit him with the shovel

476
00:27:39,540 --> 00:27:42,920
He's like, oh that wasn't that didn't feel very descriptive

477
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:50,740
But yeah, he's he's he got pretty brutalized there he's still up but

478
00:27:50,740 --> 00:27:54,380
Yeah, so now we're back to the top of the order

479
00:27:54,380 --> 00:28:02,080
which means it is Sullivan's turn and Sullivan oh yeah also Connery I will

480
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:09,480
say is bloodied between you and you and Sullivan's attacks so he's got yeah

481
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:18,040
just 13 HP left or Sullivan Sullivan is going to throw another dagger at this

482
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:25,400
guy see how he does he has advantage obviously so that's beautiful okay let's

bus is like in a circle that's how good of a storyteller you are oh you guys he

489
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:13,080
missed the dagger he missed so he just throws it and just sails over his head

490
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:18,400
And you see you see immediately you you could look at Sullivan the fries crest fallen

491
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:21,720
He's had such a string of successes the moment he failed

492
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:25,560
It's just like he's back to where he always is just the second. It's over

493
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:31,620
And it is now the imps turn impy impy the changeling

Fortunately for you, he does hit.

He does 3 damage.

511
00:29:56,920 --> 00:29:57,920
Oh, man.

512
00:29:57,920 --> 00:29:58,920
Yeah.

513
00:29:58,920 --> 00:29:59,920
So he just runs in and just like, in frustration, he's like vomiting up doo doo and he's like,

514
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:00,920
"I'm gonna go get my AC."

515
00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:01,920
And he's like, "I'm gonna go get my AC."

516
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:02,920
And he's like, "I'm gonna go get my AC."

517
00:30:02,920 --> 00:30:03,920
And he's like, "I'm gonna go get my AC."

518
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:04,920
And he's like, "I'm gonna go get my AC."

519
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:05,920
three damage.

520
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:06,920
Oh man.

521
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:11,400
Yeah, so he just runs in and just like like in frustration.

522
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:15,520
He's like vomiting up doo doo and he just like fucking headbutts you in the gut, which

523
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:20,280
is just like enough to like make you like kind of like, oh shit, like this is not this

524
00:30:20,280 --> 00:30:21,280
might not end well.

525
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:23,840
I gotta keep up appearances.

526
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:25,320
Make sure you keep intimidating them.

527
00:30:25,320 --> 00:30:26,320
Yeah, you like?

528
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:30,680
Yeah, I pretty much got like a million HP points left.

529
00:30:30,680 --> 00:30:31,680
Like whatever.

530
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:34,480
And pussy roll deception, all right

531
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:39,640
14 yeah, he's like man. He's probably has a lot of HP. He's like

532
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:44,720
Like a million or something you're like eyes a little bit out of your socket

533
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:54,900
Okay, cool it is now Connery is turn who he is going to

534
00:30:54,900 --> 00:30:58,920
Strike back at you

535
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:03,420
Dogen after you you let landed that hefty blow on him

536
00:31:03,420 --> 00:31:08,920
The way he's gonna do it though. He's going to cast a spell

537
00:31:08,920 --> 00:31:11,720
so he

538
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:13,720
holds his arms aloft and

539
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:18,700
You see these like large like ghostly arms

540
00:31:18,700 --> 00:31:21,440
Sort of a coming towards you

541
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:27,320
Dogen I dance and for hey, we're about to find out

542
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:33,680
And yeah, roll a wisdom saving throw.

543
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:35,920
10.

544
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:37,000
No.

545
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:40,200
So these arms come towards you

546
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:43,180
and you try to like mentally like bat them away

547
00:31:43,180 --> 00:31:48,180
and they grab you and they hold you completely still.

548
00:31:48,180 --> 00:31:53,360
And what, you guys don't see these arms.

549
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:55,000
They're a mental sort of thing.

550
00:31:55,000 --> 00:32:00,960
He's cast hold person on you and you are paralyzed like five seconds too late. I go choke

551
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:05,040
Say not this time and so you're

552
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:06,840
paralyzed

553
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:09,780
we'll see if that's gonna be of any use to him though because

554
00:32:09,780 --> 00:32:12,800
But first it's gonna be

555
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:18,200
Mr. Yud yud yud ours turn you're just sort of chilling. Sorry Patrick

556
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:20,960
We're going to evil Steve. Oh

557
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:24,040
My turn again. My arms are at my side like

558
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:32,500
I'm on the ground just like yeah kind of like a weeble yeah you see the prince is

559
00:32:32,500 --> 00:32:36,680
like the prince is like trying to shake you awake the prince should hand him the

560
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:41,200
cookie come on this guy's useless if the prince is shaking him away you know what

561
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:44,820
I'm the cookie you know what doing absolutely nothing for me right now can

562
00:32:44,820 --> 00:32:48,160
you know what me like a I'm actually I'm a hundred percent okay that makes total

563
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:53,560
sense to me that's a good call I'm very okay with that did you convince me um so

564
00:32:53,560 --> 00:33:00,700
So the prince is panicking a little bit and he goes into your pocket.

565
00:33:00,700 --> 00:33:03,400
He remembers you saying, "Never go into my pocket."

566
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:06,000
That is what a five-year-old kid would do too.

567
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:07,000
He's like, "This guy's dead.

568
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:08,600
I should put a cookie in his mouth."

569
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:15,840
And he's panicking and he's sort of sniffling.

570
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:18,520
He's worried about you.

571
00:33:18,520 --> 00:33:21,860
And he just shoves the cookie in your mouth.

572
00:33:21,860 --> 00:33:23,260
So that's a healing potion.

573
00:33:23,260 --> 00:33:25,260
I believe we said right each cookie.

574
00:33:25,260 --> 00:33:31,560
So that's 2d 4 plus 2 is a healing potion in D&D.

575
00:33:31,560 --> 00:33:34,760
If I'm correct.

576
00:33:34,760 --> 00:33:35,660
Yes, I'm am.

577
00:33:35,660 --> 00:33:38,960
So that is 7 plus 2.

578
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:39,860
That's 9.

579
00:33:39,860 --> 00:33:41,260
Oh, baby.

580
00:33:41,260 --> 00:33:44,560
So you got 9 HP back and so yeah, you just shoot awake.

581
00:33:44,560 --> 00:33:46,460
You've got like these delicious cookies.

582
00:33:46,460 --> 00:33:46,960
Cooper.

583
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:48,060
Cooper elf cookies.

584
00:33:48,060 --> 00:33:48,560
And that was it.

585
00:33:48,560 --> 00:33:50,660
What was it like a lemon poppy seed cookie?

586
00:33:50,660 --> 00:33:55,940
That was a it really hit the spot. I'm gonna I'm just gonna sit this one out. I'm gonna sit the rest of this

587
00:33:55,940 --> 00:34:01,500
I got one health point. I mean I got a million

588
00:34:01,500 --> 00:34:06,660
No, why don't you try one of these? Why don't you try one of these cookies? I

589
00:34:06,660 --> 00:34:13,500
Don't have a sweet tooth like that. I have maybe like a hamburger. That's I

590
00:34:13,500 --> 00:34:16,300
Don't have a hamburger or anything like that

591
00:34:18,220 --> 00:34:22,580
All right, well if it's gonna be the case then I'm definitely gonna sit this one out

592
00:34:22,580 --> 00:34:27,540
Yeah, so you want to skip your turn? No, can I get attacked?

593
00:34:27,540 --> 00:34:32,460
I get attacked so I can like block it or something

594
00:34:32,460 --> 00:34:38,740
Yeah, I'll make try to make that happen one HP fucking bash

595
00:34:38,740 --> 00:34:44,300
Fuck you. So I it's is it my turn right now. It's your turn. Yeah, it's sort of going back

596
00:34:44,300 --> 00:34:47,500
Yeah, I'm gonna shit this one out and I sit down I go

597
00:34:47,500 --> 00:34:53,500
Uh, what the hell? And I just turn, I'm sitting down and I take my bow and arrow out and I use uh, Conneria.

598
00:34:53,500 --> 00:34:54,500
Go for it.

599
00:34:54,500 --> 00:34:56,500
Okay, me. Fuck.

600
00:34:56,500 --> 00:34:58,500
Let me fuck.

601
00:34:58,500 --> 00:35:00,500
No. What?

602
00:35:00,500 --> 00:35:01,500
[Laughter]

603
00:35:01,500 --> 00:35:05,500
Uh, alright, I'm gonna use my arrow of "You're about to crap your pants."

604
00:35:05,500 --> 00:35:06,500
Oh yeah.

605
00:35:06,500 --> 00:35:07,500
God, you have that arrow?

606
00:35:07,500 --> 00:35:11,500
[Laughter]

607
00:35:11,500 --> 00:35:14,500
Wait, what does that fucking do exactly?

608
00:35:15,500 --> 00:35:17,920
uh... yes

609
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:21,940
and i did a d_-day mature that you're all damages that of a attack try the attack

610
00:35:21,940 --> 00:35:24,420
role i know i can get out of the

611
00:35:24,420 --> 00:35:27,500
uh... i think the plus other got a great

612
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:30,300
good fucking god i guess role for damage

613
00:35:30,300 --> 00:35:32,100
okay role for damage again

614
00:35:32,100 --> 00:35:35,100
yeah is accurate nine

615
00:35:35,100 --> 00:35:39,660
uh... yen dogan is in range so i will use this time is not as a military uh...

616
00:35:39,660 --> 00:35:43,980
let me read with the error of your but the crap your pants does

617
00:35:43,980 --> 00:35:45,580
I mean, here's, I'll tell you right now.

618
00:35:45,580 --> 00:35:49,300
When this arrow strikes a humanoid target, the target must immediately use its reaction

619
00:35:49,300 --> 00:35:53,620
to attempt to find an out of sight area as its bowels clench and roil.

620
00:35:53,620 --> 00:35:58,820
On the target's next turn, it must succeed a D16 Con Saving Throw or spend its action,

621
00:35:58,820 --> 00:36:03,420
bonus action, free action, and movement speed crapping itself, then hastily try to clean

622
00:36:03,420 --> 00:36:04,420
itself up.

623
00:36:04,420 --> 00:36:08,300
Uh, you killed him, though.

624
00:36:08,300 --> 00:36:09,300
So he's gonna shit anyway.

625
00:36:09,300 --> 00:36:11,380
So do you want to describe what happens?

626
00:36:11,380 --> 00:36:15,380
I want you to describe what happens as the arrow enters his heart.

627
00:36:15,380 --> 00:36:18,880
Well, I'm sitting down and I'm like, "Eh, what the hell?"

628
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:21,940
And I just point it, just really quick.

629
00:36:21,940 --> 00:36:25,000
Just like, arrow in my hand, boom, yeah.

630
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:34,280
And then I guess it hits his heart or something and then he dies immediately.

631
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:36,220
And then just shits.

632
00:36:36,220 --> 00:36:41,680
I think, Dogen, you might be close enough and perceptive enough to see that as the arrow

633
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:49,180
enters his heart, you watch his eyes flicker a couple moments, scanning for a place to

634
00:36:49,180 --> 00:36:54,580
go to the bathroom, and then you watch them just go completely glazed over.

635
00:36:54,580 --> 00:37:00,400
And so his last moments were just trying to find a place to take a shit as he just falls

636
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:02,480
to the ground.

637
00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:11,960
at this moment was no no no no and just vanishes hey uh hey dogan can you grab that arrow for me

638
00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:18,600
that's uh am i unparalyzed yeah okay i go to pick up the arrow and i accidentally touch the arrowhead

639
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:32,280
and i go oh you idiot here let me do it and i do this oh hey hey sullivan can you grab that for me

640
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:39,020
I don't feel like getting up. I just yeah, okay. I'll go and he he press touches the arrow on the tip and he just feels fine

641
00:37:39,020 --> 00:37:45,680
I have a bowel problem. I think actually so this is making me pretty nervous

642
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:48,500
Okay. Now I have to go

643
00:37:48,500 --> 00:37:52,980
Yes, you guys

644
00:37:52,980 --> 00:37:54,760
Whoop their ass

645
00:37:54,760 --> 00:37:59,820
It was pretty close though. Like I said to you guys over in our secret group chat

646
00:38:00,980 --> 00:38:02,980
You guys you guys level up

647
00:38:02,980 --> 00:38:08,820
Is this is this the time this is the level up time if you guys want to do that

648
00:38:08,820 --> 00:38:11,700
Okay. All right. Let's do it. So

649
00:38:11,700 --> 00:38:13,820
in

650
00:38:13,820 --> 00:38:15,460
D&D beyond

651
00:38:15,460 --> 00:38:17,460
Go to your character

652
00:38:17,460 --> 00:38:19,620
Go to edit

653
00:38:19,620 --> 00:38:23,740
Like there's like a little gear and you can click on like edit your character. Yeah

654
00:38:23,740 --> 00:38:28,340
and you can just you can raise the level up one and

655
00:38:30,100 --> 00:38:36,020
Some of you will get new stuff. I don't remember. I don't think most of you will though. I don't think I get anything

656
00:38:36,020 --> 00:38:40,220
I get to pick my fighting style. Oh, yeah, you get you get some stuff

657
00:38:40,220 --> 00:38:45,060
I think you're the only one who gets real stuff. I think level three is when so many options I have to read about

658
00:38:45,060 --> 00:38:47,060
Oh, no. Mm-hmm

659
00:38:47,060 --> 00:38:53,320
So I'm gonna go to your oh, I have higher hit points, that's good. Yes. Oh, yeah

660
00:38:53,820 --> 00:38:59,820
If I level up, do I get max, do I get highest HP again? No.

661
00:38:59,820 --> 00:39:02,820
I guess we have to wait for a long wait for that.

662
00:39:02,820 --> 00:39:06,820
Or you could use a short rest and shift.

663
00:39:06,820 --> 00:39:09,820
But yeah, so you're going to get more HP.

664
00:39:09,820 --> 00:39:14,820
Now, Blessed Warrior, I could learn some spells, which would be cool.

665
00:39:14,820 --> 00:39:16,820
Ooh, yeah. That is cool.

666
00:39:16,820 --> 00:39:18,820
Can you just, what's the deal with cantrips?

667
00:39:18,820 --> 00:39:22,360
So cantrips, cantrips you can cast at will whenever.

668
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:24,740
You never run out of them.

669
00:39:24,740 --> 00:39:26,660
I'm probably going to pick that.

670
00:39:26,660 --> 00:39:28,780
Let me look at what the cantrips are.

671
00:39:28,780 --> 00:39:29,780
Yeah.

672
00:39:29,780 --> 00:39:30,780
Light?

673
00:39:30,780 --> 00:39:34,020
Light gives you, you can do light.

674
00:39:34,020 --> 00:39:35,020
You can make light.

675
00:39:35,020 --> 00:39:37,660
Mending, I can fix things.

676
00:39:37,660 --> 00:39:38,660
Yeah.

677
00:39:38,660 --> 00:39:41,180
What would, what would Dogen pick?

678
00:39:41,180 --> 00:39:42,300
Is kind of, you know.

679
00:39:42,300 --> 00:39:43,300
That's a good question.

680
00:39:43,300 --> 00:39:45,060
A Dungeons and Dragons type question.

681
00:39:45,060 --> 00:39:46,060
Yes it is.

682
00:39:46,060 --> 00:39:48,580
This is the way of the world.

683
00:39:48,580 --> 00:39:51,860
I'm choosing Thaumaturgy and Word of Radiance, I think.

684
00:39:51,860 --> 00:39:55,140
- Woo! - Unless...

685
00:39:55,140 --> 00:39:57,220
Is Sacred Flame AoE? No.

686
00:39:57,220 --> 00:39:58,820
- No, it's not. - I'm picking Word of...

687
00:39:58,820 --> 00:40:02,340
- Thaumaturgy and Word of Radiance... - Okay.

688
00:40:02,340 --> 00:40:03,540
...are my two...

689
00:40:03,540 --> 00:40:05,620
- Yeah. - ...cantrips that I'm learning.

690
00:40:05,620 --> 00:40:10,100
Yeah. So, yeah, that's from Xanathar's Guide to Everything.

691
00:40:10,100 --> 00:40:17,460
So, it's a very... it's a cool, cool spell.

692
00:40:17,460 --> 00:40:22,460
Wait, is Word of Radiance AoE?

693
00:40:22,460 --> 00:40:23,460
Yes.

694
00:40:23,460 --> 00:40:24,460
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

695
00:40:24,460 --> 00:40:26,460
It wraps you in each creature, which is right, right, right,

696
00:40:26,460 --> 00:40:27,460
because everyone around you.

697
00:40:27,460 --> 00:40:28,460
So basically, like, you're surrounded.

698
00:40:28,460 --> 00:40:31,460
Everyone I can see that I can choose, yeah.

699
00:40:31,460 --> 00:40:32,460
Hell yeah.

700
00:40:32,460 --> 00:40:34,460
So, yeah.

701
00:40:34,460 --> 00:40:37,460
So, yeah, you, in this moment of leveling up,

702
00:40:37,460 --> 00:40:39,460
you commune with Dogen, the dirt god,

703
00:40:39,460 --> 00:40:44,460
and he sees that you are, you know...

704
00:40:44,460 --> 00:40:47,460
You know, oh, also you're going to get divine smite too.

705
00:40:47,460 --> 00:40:51,460
So basically it's like you're recommitting yourself to Dogen the Dirt God.

706
00:40:51,460 --> 00:40:54,460
You get divine smite which means you can spend a spell slot.

707
00:40:54,460 --> 00:40:58,460
After you land an attack, you can spend a spell slot to add an extra d8 of damage.

708
00:40:58,460 --> 00:41:00,460
Oh, okay, that's cool.

709
00:41:00,460 --> 00:41:02,460
So it's very, very strong.

710
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:05,460
Do I get spells or is that just for cantrips?

711
00:41:05,460 --> 00:41:11,460
You'll get spells, you can get some spells later because your paladins are basically a gish class.

712
00:41:11,460 --> 00:41:13,460
So it's pretty cool.

713
00:41:13,460 --> 00:41:19,460
They're just, they're like very much the typical spellblade class, I would say, actually.

714
00:41:19,460 --> 00:41:27,460
Some people would maybe say, I mean there's obviously like Hexblade for Warlock and stuff, but like as far as straight, nobody cares.

715
00:41:27,460 --> 00:41:35,460
So yeah, yeah, you commune with Dogen, and you know, divine from him what you're meant, how you're meant to fight.

716
00:41:35,460 --> 00:41:40,660
And he you know, you determine that you're supposed to use magic.

717
00:41:40,660 --> 00:41:44,660
You're supposed to become more of a magical fighter a silly little

718
00:41:44,660 --> 00:41:48,360
magic fighter man and you guys leveled up which is pretty cool.

719
00:41:48,360 --> 00:41:51,060
And now yeah, the hovel is yours for the taking.

720
00:41:51,060 --> 00:41:56,560
There's no sign of the jester around whatever the jester wherever

721
00:41:56,560 --> 00:42:01,360
he was or they were whatever doesn't seem to be around anymore,

722
00:42:01,460 --> 00:42:05,760
But you see, you know, Connor is holding, you know, or he just dropped

723
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:09,060
Connery has just dropped the Yoni egg of Baskin.

724
00:42:09,060 --> 00:42:10,260
So you see it.

725
00:42:10,260 --> 00:42:15,260
It looks like a sort of typical Jade Yoni egg, except it is

726
00:42:15,260 --> 00:42:19,160
has tiger print around it instead of like Jade.

727
00:42:19,160 --> 00:42:21,160
Is that the crystal ball there?

728
00:42:21,160 --> 00:42:21,560
Was that?

729
00:42:21,560 --> 00:42:23,760
Yeah, I'm looking for the crystal ball.

730
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:25,660
I don't care about this Yoni egg thing.

731
00:42:25,660 --> 00:42:26,860
I care about the crystal ball.

732
00:42:26,860 --> 00:42:29,360
You can go and you can actually just throw that Yoni egg away.

733
00:42:30,060 --> 00:42:32,380
i really don't care about it at all you know that

734
00:42:32,380 --> 00:42:37,300
undertake that put in my my pocket of throat after a very funny trash barrel

735
00:42:37,300 --> 00:42:38,540
and litter

736
00:42:38,540 --> 00:42:43,100
and so yeah you guys to go into his hovel and see what he has their uh...

737
00:42:43,100 --> 00:42:44,680
in connery is hovel

738
00:42:44,680 --> 00:42:47,400
yeah is also is anyone damaged

739
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:49,220
and one h_p_

740
00:42:49,220 --> 00:42:51,500
okay give me all the all kill you five h_p_

741
00:42:51,500 --> 00:42:53,780
yeah

742
00:42:53,780 --> 00:42:55,740
the you've got dirt into his wounds

743
00:42:55,740 --> 00:42:57,440
which is how you describe it.

744
00:42:57,440 --> 00:42:59,340
And I get my fingernails in there too.

745
00:42:59,340 --> 00:43:00,940
So you describe lay on hands.

746
00:43:00,940 --> 00:43:05,040
Yeah, it's a deep cleanse or more like rub on hands when I'm

747
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:05,540
fine.

748
00:43:05,540 --> 00:43:06,740
Whoa, giving it.

749
00:43:06,740 --> 00:43:07,640
Yeah, come on.

750
00:43:07,640 --> 00:43:08,740
Come on.

751
00:43:08,740 --> 00:43:10,740
It's just true.

752
00:43:10,740 --> 00:43:14,040
So yeah, you go into his hovel.

753
00:43:14,040 --> 00:43:17,240
It's pretty modest modestly sized.

754
00:43:17,240 --> 00:43:18,640
Got some wood furniture.

755
00:43:18,640 --> 00:43:23,540
It's got a some posters up of the jester.

756
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:27,440
He's obviously a big fan of the Jester.

757
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:29,440
[laughter]

758
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:31,440
[laughter]

759
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:33,440
[laughter]

760
00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:35,440
[laughter]

761
00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:37,440
Uh, yeah, uh...

762
00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:39,440
That's environmental storytelling right there.

763
00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:41,440
Oh yeah, you know me. I'm brilliant.

764
00:43:41,440 --> 00:43:43,440
And, uh, yeah.

765
00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:45,440
Yeah, I mean, you can obviously rummage around, see if you find anything

766
00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:47,440
else that he has. Um, you know.

767
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:49,440
You could do an investigation check.

768
00:43:49,440 --> 00:43:51,440
Do a little bit of digging. I'm gonna investigate.

769
00:43:51,440 --> 00:43:53,440
See what you can find.

770
00:43:53,440 --> 00:43:55,840
can obviously loot him as well. Yeah, I'm gonna investigate

771
00:43:55,840 --> 00:44:00,160
too. Okay. I got it and I will I will also investigate. Oh

772
00:44:00,160 --> 00:44:06,240
yeah. Oh, you got 21. You got a crit. Patrick Yodar got a crit

773
00:44:06,240 --> 00:44:11,680
Patrick Yodar. You really dive into this place. You know,

774
00:44:11,680 --> 00:44:14,400
there are other things I could have described other sort of

775
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:17,520
clues I could have given you as to where to look, but you

776
00:44:17,520 --> 00:44:21,280
you didn't need them. You just sort of divine right away what

777
00:44:21,280 --> 00:44:27,120
this place was my second use of define that way I gotta find some new words and

778
00:44:27,120 --> 00:44:33,680
so a couple of the things that you find as you look first under his sort of cot

779
00:44:33,680 --> 00:44:41,040
that he has there you find that he was storing some sort of viscous substance in

780
00:44:41,040 --> 00:44:47,200
a bunch of vials I'm not gonna open these and I'm not gonna taste test them

781
00:44:47,200 --> 00:44:53,200
Yeah, you're not sure exactly what they're made of but they are there.

782
00:44:53,200 --> 00:44:54,500
They're in these vials.

783
00:44:54,500 --> 00:44:59,500
You don't know what he was making you also find in a little box

784
00:44:59,500 --> 00:45:07,200
a wooden box that has a picture of has like a like a jester hat

785
00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:09,500
on it and it's like a little lock box when you open it up.

786
00:45:09,500 --> 00:45:11,200
It's got like a hundred gold pieces in there.

787
00:45:11,200 --> 00:45:13,900
So you find that I just weld.

788
00:45:14,200 --> 00:45:22,200
Yeah, and then yeah, as you sort of rummage around through you find you find just some notes that have been left from

789
00:45:22,200 --> 00:45:25,800
Well, I like notes of his own writing of him

790
00:45:25,800 --> 00:45:30,840
Experimenting and it's a lot about the goo. He was messing with this goo. That's in this

791
00:45:30,840 --> 00:45:37,320
Jar talks about that. He was putting in his his excrement his perspiration

792
00:45:37,840 --> 00:45:45,180
All this stuff and like trial runs with it and the goo says it can make him very very slippery so

793
00:45:45,180 --> 00:45:48,760
Slippery that he can't be he can't be reached

794
00:45:48,760 --> 00:45:53,940
He can't be grabbed or grappled or anything. And so it's just like about what he's been doing with the good Sullivan

795
00:45:53,940 --> 00:45:55,940
I made you a love potion

796
00:45:55,940 --> 00:45:59,940
I'm okay. Like I don't

797
00:45:59,940 --> 00:46:06,760
What do you what do you mean? You made me a love for what? Am I gonna fall? No, I think you're gonna want to drink

798
00:46:06,760 --> 00:46:10,960
this I think it's a yeah it's called it's called the love

799
00:46:10,960 --> 00:46:13,460
potion, but it's actually a potion that will make you

800
00:46:13,460 --> 00:46:16,060
taller. Yeah. It's called that because you're going to love

801
00:46:16,060 --> 00:46:19,460
it. It's specifically says in the in the great writings that

802
00:46:19,460 --> 00:46:22,460
you've read like you you you douse yourself with the goo.

803
00:46:22,460 --> 00:46:26,260
You do not drink it like it's not at all. So I didn't read

804
00:46:26,260 --> 00:46:31,360
those. So oh yeah. Okay. So you don't even know so you if you

805
00:46:31,360 --> 00:46:35,760
want to you can definitely roll a deception check Patrick

806
00:46:35,760 --> 00:46:54,240
to

807
00:46:54,240 --> 00:46:55,240
6 deception.

808
00:46:55,240 --> 00:46:58,240
You're getting crits though.

809
00:46:58,240 --> 00:47:01,240
See, not getting a crit there.

810
00:47:01,240 --> 00:47:04,240
Oh my god, this is not a good switch dude.

811
00:47:04,240 --> 00:47:05,240
What the fuck.

812
00:47:05,240 --> 00:47:06,240
Oh my god, yeah I mean.

813
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:07,240
Okay, there's a crit again.

814
00:47:07,240 --> 00:47:08,240
What the fuck.

815
00:47:08,240 --> 00:47:09,240
You get 4 and fuck.

816
00:47:09,240 --> 00:47:13,240
I think my items just really, I have really good stats.

817
00:47:13,240 --> 00:47:16,240
Not how the crits work.

818
00:47:16,240 --> 00:47:18,240
I'm taking you to Vegas dude.

819
00:47:18,240 --> 00:47:19,240
Okay, I got 11.

820
00:47:19,240 --> 00:47:26,960
So, SolvinTheFrog 100% believes you, that it's something you should drink, and so he starts

821
00:47:26,960 --> 00:47:31,000
to drink it, and it's- he vomits immediately.

822
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:33,480
He's like, "BLEGH!"

823
00:47:33,480 --> 00:47:39,240
And also, he's- "My insides feel weird."

824
00:47:39,240 --> 00:47:41,560
"That's not my problem."

825
00:47:41,560 --> 00:47:46,240
"Ugh, this doesn't feel good.

826
00:47:46,240 --> 00:47:53,960
Oh, oh, he sees walking all weird now like he's doing like a little dance like he's like

827
00:47:53,960 --> 00:48:00,200
he's all fucked up like he's like, you know, in Ghostbusters 2 when they put the ooze in

828
00:48:00,200 --> 00:48:14,200
the toaster and it's like, I see I see Sullivan's having a bad reaction. I go quickly Sullivan

829
00:48:14,200 --> 00:48:15,200
Get it out of your system.

830
00:48:15,200 --> 00:48:18,300
And I try to grab Patrick's magic arrow to touch him with it,

831
00:48:18,300 --> 00:48:21,000
but I accidentally touch the arrowhead and I go, oh,

832
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:27,600
Yeah, and then you also of course find a crystal ball.

833
00:48:27,600 --> 00:48:34,700
I don't know if it works, but you do find a crystal ball in

834
00:48:34,700 --> 00:48:36,000
there. I would like to use it.

835
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:40,000
Okay, you can try to roll like an Arcana check to see if you

836
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:42,300
can figure out how this thing works.

837
00:48:42,400 --> 00:48:44,940
that's really would be like a there are a lot of you could do

838
00:48:44,940 --> 00:48:47,220
yet seems like it's me iraq

839
00:48:47,220 --> 00:48:49,500
could be iraq instead

840
00:48:49,500 --> 00:48:52,820
could be a glassy rock

841
00:48:52,820 --> 00:48:53,660
uh...

842
00:48:53,660 --> 00:48:55,140
here but i don't know if you're correct

843
00:48:55,140 --> 00:48:57,220
he's he's he's he's he's

844
00:48:57,220 --> 00:48:58,780
okay uh...

845
00:48:58,780 --> 00:49:02,740
and uh... it's hard to find exactly how this would work god again

846
00:49:02,740 --> 00:49:04,420
uh... so

847
00:49:04,420 --> 00:49:06,220
a smash it

848
00:49:06,220 --> 00:49:09,100
it breaks

849
00:49:09,100 --> 00:49:14,220
So like magical spirit comes out of it or anything. What about a genie spongebob comes out? Oh

850
00:49:14,220 --> 00:49:23,420
Bob hi guys. Hi guys. Oh shit. Oh

851
00:49:23,420 --> 00:49:28,500
It's football punch him out of the window the hovel

852
00:49:28,500 --> 00:49:34,060
I don't like crystal balls

853
00:49:34,060 --> 00:49:38,060
That was so fucked up. Let's get out of here.

854
00:49:38,060 --> 00:49:42,060
So yeah, I mean you guys have the Yoni egg now.

855
00:49:42,060 --> 00:49:46,060
You can bring that back to the white woman of the woods.

856
00:49:46,060 --> 00:49:50,060
Or you can do whatever you want.

857
00:49:50,060 --> 00:49:54,060
Let's do that and then let's also get the beast. I want 100% the woods.

858
00:49:54,060 --> 00:49:58,060
Yeah. Okay. Alright. So you guys

859
00:49:58,060 --> 00:50:02,060
start to make your way back

860
00:50:02,060 --> 00:50:07,640
the white woman of the woods. If you recall it was kind of earlier in the

861
00:50:07,640 --> 00:50:10,500
morning when you guys arrived because you slept the evening when you're

862
00:50:10,500 --> 00:50:16,940
attacked by the changeling cowboy and you make it through the woods you kind

863
00:50:16,940 --> 00:50:21,700
of know the way back at this point you know how to avoid the monkey and you

864
00:50:21,700 --> 00:50:26,780
arrive at the park. Talk about the monkey I was thinking for a second what is he talking about?

865
00:50:26,780 --> 00:50:31,780
Yeah, there is a monkey. It was very brief, but I had the monkey there.

866
00:50:31,780 --> 00:50:34,780
And, yeah, you guys arrive at the pond.

867
00:50:34,780 --> 00:50:39,780
And as you're walking towards the pond, it's not...

868
00:50:39,780 --> 00:50:45,780
Once it's in view and you keep walking, you walk for about a minute and he's just not getting any closer.

869
00:50:45,780 --> 00:50:54,780
And once you all sort of collectively realize this, that's when the jester appears again.

870
00:50:54,780 --> 00:50:56,780
I

871
00:50:56,780 --> 00:51:00,700
Fucking guy I

872
00:51:00,700 --> 00:51:08,520
I'd like to make a deal with you three. Hey, check this out. No, fuck you clown

873
00:51:08,520 --> 00:51:14,780
Laughing like that like that funny you like

874
00:51:17,300 --> 00:51:19,300
Oh, you think this is funny?

875
00:51:19,300 --> 00:51:21,300
I show my ass.

876
00:51:21,300 --> 00:51:23,300
That's my ass!

877
00:51:23,300 --> 00:51:25,300
Oh, now you laughing at my ass, huh?

878
00:51:25,300 --> 00:51:27,300
That's two middle fingers that I'm pointing at.

879
00:51:27,300 --> 00:51:29,300
Looks like this guy thinks we're real comedians, huh?

880
00:51:29,300 --> 00:51:31,300
Sullivan, fuck this kid up!

881
00:51:31,300 --> 00:51:33,300
Oh, no way!

882
00:51:33,300 --> 00:51:35,300
Fuck him up, Sully!

883
00:51:35,300 --> 00:51:37,300
I'm so, he's so weird.

884
00:51:37,300 --> 00:51:39,300
I'm really nervous.

885
00:51:39,300 --> 00:51:41,300
You know what?

886
00:51:41,300 --> 00:51:43,300
He is pretty weird.

887
00:51:43,300 --> 00:51:45,300
Thanks, man!

888
00:51:45,300 --> 00:51:53,400
bet and the jester after he's done laughing I was like I would like to make

889
00:51:53,400 --> 00:52:01,420
a deal with you all give me the yoni egg I can't hold it on my own it needs to be

890
00:52:01,420 --> 00:52:10,660
given to me by a proper vessel a person and vessel what I if you well that's

891
00:52:10,660 --> 00:52:14,620
what what did you think Connery a was think it was as natural talent as a

892
00:52:14,620 --> 00:52:28,500
the

893
00:52:28,500 --> 00:52:35,500
the

894
00:52:35,500 --> 00:52:48,500
a

895
00:52:48,500 --> 00:52:50,740
So you were enhancing- so I think- okay you-

896
00:52:50,740 --> 00:52:52,740
Give me the egg.

897
00:52:52,740 --> 00:52:54,740
You're excused from the conversation.

898
00:52:54,740 --> 00:52:56,740
Give me the-

899
00:52:56,740 --> 00:53:00,580
So you were- you were enhancing the- the warlock.

900
00:53:00,580 --> 00:53:02,580
Give me the egg.

901
00:53:02,580 --> 00:53:03,460
Were you-

902
00:53:03,460 --> 00:53:05,460
I wasn't enhancing him.

903
00:53:05,460 --> 00:53:07,460
You did male enhancement to that man.

904
00:53:07,460 --> 00:53:09,460
Natural male enhancement?

905
00:53:09,460 --> 00:53:10,260
Come on.

906
00:53:10,260 --> 00:53:12,260
You- wait, hold on, hold on.

907
00:53:12,260 --> 00:53:14,740
We beat him so you must be pretty weak.

908
00:53:14,740 --> 00:53:17,860
Yeah, are you saying you have the secret to natural male enhancement?

909
00:53:17,860 --> 00:53:20,860
Is that what this is about?

910
00:53:20,860 --> 00:53:22,860
I'm not weak and no.

911
00:53:22,860 --> 00:53:25,860
No, okay, that was gonna say definite deal.

912
00:53:25,860 --> 00:53:29,860
If you're so not weak, why don't you just kill us right now to prove it?

913
00:53:29,860 --> 00:53:37,860
100% would have been a deal if you would have given me a pill or something that would make my penis stay hard.

914
00:53:37,860 --> 00:53:41,860
I'm gonna punch you in the gut if you get too close to me.

915
00:53:41,860 --> 00:53:50,860
I can only control creatures and send them to do my bidding like the kitsune's.

916
00:53:50,860 --> 00:53:58,860
I am coming to you now before you give the yoni egg to that stupid woman.

917
00:53:58,860 --> 00:54:02,860
Hey, she had sex with my uncle one time.

918
00:54:02,860 --> 00:54:04,860
Alright, she's technically my aunt.

919
00:54:04,860 --> 00:54:07,860
That's not... Are you sure?

920
00:54:07,860 --> 00:54:15,080
I call her I called her auntie once and she told me not to do that because it was during that I'm not gonna get into

921
00:54:15,080 --> 00:54:16,600
that but

922
00:54:16,600 --> 00:54:20,980
Give me the egg. I'll show you how to leave these woods and

923
00:54:20,980 --> 00:54:26,400
To top it off. I'll give you this and he produces a

924
00:54:26,400 --> 00:54:30,200
scepter that looks like it's made of

925
00:54:30,200 --> 00:54:36,520
Tragedy and comedy masks kind of all like stacked up on one another

926
00:54:37,840 --> 00:54:40,200
And on top of it has like a jester crown

927
00:54:40,200 --> 00:54:43,920
It's a very very powerful artifact

928
00:54:43,920 --> 00:54:47,280
Can curse those you wish to?

929
00:54:47,280 --> 00:54:51,080
because with uncontrollable laughter

930
00:54:51,080 --> 00:54:58,360
All right, so you can like it you could sell it. I like these smiling guys, but what are you frowning faces all about?

931
00:54:58,360 --> 00:55:04,520
How much care for that

932
00:55:06,400 --> 00:55:09,080
Well, do you have an all comedy scepter?

933
00:55:09,080 --> 00:55:15,440
well, some would say that the other side of of comedy is is a

934
00:55:15,440 --> 00:55:18,400
Tragedy and so they could they're inseparable

935
00:55:18,400 --> 00:55:23,860
What what are you talking about? Thanks must be funny. Shut up. Tell it

936
00:55:23,860 --> 00:55:33,200
Yeah, you know what fuck I'ma kill your ass I'm gonna say this right now shut up. All right, we're gonna do the talking

937
00:55:33,200 --> 00:55:35,980
Yeah

938
00:55:35,980 --> 00:55:40,500
See we do the talk.

939
00:55:40,500 --> 00:55:43,060
If you don't want to take this deal, fine.

940
00:55:43,060 --> 00:55:45,980
What did I just say?

941
00:55:45,980 --> 00:55:51,700
Okay, I'm waiting.

942
00:55:51,700 --> 00:55:54,820
I'm going to count to three.

943
00:55:54,820 --> 00:55:56,420
And I'm going to count to fifteen.

944
00:55:56,420 --> 00:56:01,180
A big feat for both of you.

945
00:56:01,180 --> 00:56:04,140
Because fifteen is higher than three.

946
00:56:04,140 --> 00:56:06,140
Yeah, that's five threes

947
00:56:06,140 --> 00:56:09,180
All right nerd

948
00:56:09,180 --> 00:56:12,060
One

949
00:56:12,060 --> 00:56:14,300
Two one three

950
00:56:14,300 --> 00:56:20,140
Four one sink fuck. Yeah, fuck it. I'm killing you. I attack him. Okay

951
00:56:20,140 --> 00:56:23,140
when you wait I have

952
00:56:23,140 --> 00:56:25,220
66

953
00:56:25,220 --> 00:56:27,220
I killed myself

954
00:56:31,180 --> 00:56:35,300
I'm messing up. I can't I can't fight you

955
00:56:35,300 --> 00:56:38,460
You can't fight me we exist in different

956
00:56:38,460 --> 00:56:45,320
Realms. All right. I'm going to the funny realm in and I'm killing you. No, don't come to the funny

957
00:56:45,320 --> 00:56:47,320
I'm going someone tell me a joke

958
00:56:47,320 --> 00:56:53,820
Quick, is that no good? No good. Tell me a joke. I think this is gonna work neck-neck. All right

959
00:56:53,820 --> 00:57:00,240
Sorry, who's there it was interrupting Sullivan who's there

960
00:57:00,240 --> 00:57:02,240
*laughter*

961
00:57:02,240 --> 00:57:04,240
*laughter*

962
00:57:04,240 --> 00:57:06,240
Oh I think I'm going somewhere!

963
00:57:06,240 --> 00:57:08,240
*laughter*

964
00:57:08,240 --> 00:57:10,240
*laughter*

965
00:57:10,240 --> 00:57:12,240
You see the world around you

966
00:57:12,240 --> 00:57:14,240
spin as you finally

967
00:57:14,240 --> 00:57:16,240
succumb to the seizure.

968
00:57:16,240 --> 00:57:18,240
*laughter*

969
00:57:18,240 --> 00:57:20,240
Yeah I'm just on the ground.

970
00:57:20,240 --> 00:57:22,240
That is not what I thought was gonna

971
00:57:22,240 --> 00:57:24,240
happen.

972
00:57:24,240 --> 00:57:26,240
Here I have these, I think I have smelling salts

973
00:57:26,240 --> 00:57:28,240
or something.

974
00:57:28,240 --> 00:57:32,000
I don't know what you do for a season.

975
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:37,760
If you don't want the scepter, you don't want a way out, you will...

976
00:57:37,760 --> 00:57:41,040
I won't be the last spirit that will hunt you down.

977
00:57:41,040 --> 00:57:42,040
God damn it.

978
00:57:42,040 --> 00:57:45,720
When I get up, I'm killing you.

979
00:57:45,720 --> 00:57:47,960
I'll send my kitsune's for you.

980
00:57:47,960 --> 00:57:53,000
I'll admit we'll be a bit weaker without the yoni egg, but they will still come down on

981
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:54,000
you.

982
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:55,000
So you'll be weak.

983
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:56,000
You're already weak.

984
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:57,160
You'll be weaker.

985
00:57:57,160 --> 00:57:58,160
I won't.

986
00:57:58,160 --> 00:58:01,960
I mean that scepter looks like crap anyway.

987
00:58:01,960 --> 00:58:02,960
CONNORIA SUCKED!

988
00:58:02,960 --> 00:58:09,600
Okay, if I had a better warlock in my employ...

989
00:58:09,600 --> 00:58:11,640
I think your whole squad's trash.

990
00:58:11,640 --> 00:58:13,520
Yeah, he's stupid.

991
00:58:13,520 --> 00:58:17,680
He'd be like, "What if I cast a spell like this?" and he'd try to use his toes.

992
00:58:17,680 --> 00:58:19,720
I had to tell him not to do that.

993
00:58:19,720 --> 00:58:21,880
Didn't make any sense.

994
00:58:21,880 --> 00:58:22,880
He sucked.

995
00:58:22,880 --> 00:58:25,720
I mean, that reflects on you.

996
00:58:25,720 --> 00:58:27,600
You keep bad company.

997
00:58:27,600 --> 00:58:29,400
I don't have anything else to say to you.

998
00:58:29,400 --> 00:58:34,840
Yeah, I you know, you've you've been here for way too long in this deal.

999
00:58:34,840 --> 00:58:37,640
We've already made it very clear this deal is not happening.

1000
00:58:37,640 --> 00:58:40,600
You've made that somewhat clear.

1001
00:58:40,600 --> 00:58:43,800
All right. Cool. Yes.

1002
00:58:43,800 --> 00:58:47,560
You guys, I don't think I think threats of violence are pretty clear indication

1003
00:58:47,560 --> 00:58:48,940
that there's going to be no deal.

1004
00:58:48,940 --> 00:58:51,800
Yeah. So is there no no deal?

1005
00:58:51,800 --> 00:58:53,540
I don't want to stick.

1006
00:58:53,540 --> 00:58:55,300
I jump up for my seizure.

1007
00:58:55,300 --> 00:58:59,980
Cool. Wow. First of all, the funny realm, really not that funny.

1008
00:58:59,980 --> 00:59:05,580
Second of all, we ain't taking your deal, you stinker.

1009
00:59:05,580 --> 00:59:07,660
So be it.

1010
00:59:07,660 --> 00:59:11,860
Well, actually, let's talk it over for 10 more minutes.

1011
00:59:11,860 --> 00:59:17,460
Yeah. And as you walk towards the pond, it now starts to get closer to you

1012
00:59:17,460 --> 00:59:24,340
and you get closer. And so as you do, you see the white woman of the woods

1013
00:59:25,100 --> 00:59:27,780
just come out of the water without you having to holler at her.

1014
00:59:27,780 --> 00:59:33,220
She's she's like, my egg, I can sense it.

1015
00:59:33,220 --> 00:59:35,260
It's near. Please.

1016
00:59:35,260 --> 00:59:36,820
Oh, I don't need to know that.

1017
00:59:36,820 --> 00:59:40,020
I watch your time of the month as nasty bullshit.

1018
00:59:40,020 --> 00:59:44,860
I spit the spit the egg out of my mouth.

1019
00:59:44,860 --> 00:59:49,420
My eyes is near.

1020
00:59:49,420 --> 00:59:53,380
This is is there any this is the worst way it's ever

1021
00:59:53,780 --> 01:00:00,140
ever have this delivered to me this is okay just just just hand it here and you

1022
01:00:00,140 --> 01:00:06,140
see her like holding her hands out for you to put the egg in do you give her

1023
01:00:06,140 --> 01:00:10,300
the egg give me like first I spit it out of my mouth and I said you're it was in

1024
01:00:10,300 --> 01:00:18,780
your what you better like that egg I had to go to the funny realm yeah that egg

1025
01:00:18,780 --> 01:00:23,420
You see her slowly dip below the water and you see her like going

1026
01:00:23,420 --> 01:00:28,580
Yeah, it's in there, yeah

1027
01:00:28,580 --> 01:00:31,340
That's what that guess that's what that feels like

1028
01:00:31,340 --> 01:00:35,300
It's been a while. Okay, and you see

1029
01:00:35,300 --> 01:00:38,900
Around her and around the pond

1030
01:00:38,900 --> 01:00:41,580
all the weird

1031
01:00:41,580 --> 01:00:45,340
plants that are like snapping at things and doing like weird little like

1032
01:00:46,260 --> 01:00:51,620
Goofy things and spitting seeds start to turn into normal plants like flowers and daffodils

1033
01:00:51,620 --> 01:00:54,460
trees with leaves that aren't

1034
01:00:54,460 --> 01:00:56,580
that don't

1035
01:00:56,580 --> 01:00:59,700
Like make you sneeze and all this weird bullshit

1036
01:00:59,700 --> 01:01:01,860
You see the thing that was like the egg that would

1037
01:01:01,860 --> 01:01:07,420
The bird that would hatch into an egg becomes an egg that can hatch into a bird this time

1038
01:01:07,420 --> 01:01:10,400
Everything is starting to look normal around her again

1039
01:01:10,400 --> 01:01:14,500
and you see she says I've

1040
01:01:15,300 --> 01:01:17,300
Restored so much of my power

1041
01:01:17,300 --> 01:01:20,020
Thank you. I cannot thank you enough

1042
01:01:20,020 --> 01:01:24,760
The the five of you even the little boy. Thank you

1043
01:01:24,760 --> 01:01:30,940
now if you wish to defeat the kitsune's I

1044
01:01:30,940 --> 01:01:39,840
Can have my I controlled the woods now they will be on your side in the coming fight. So that guy's a liar. I

1045
01:01:41,060 --> 01:01:44,060
I knew he was full of crap. He was laughing all the time.

1046
01:01:44,060 --> 01:01:48,060
He's probably just kidding about the whole thing now that I think about it.

1047
01:01:48,060 --> 01:01:50,060
That's a really strong point.

1048
01:01:50,060 --> 01:01:52,060
He could have just been joking about that.

1049
01:01:52,060 --> 01:01:57,060
Well, without the Yoni egg, he can't control the woods the same way that I could.

1050
01:01:57,060 --> 01:02:01,060
So, now he just has these kitsune eggs.

1051
01:02:01,060 --> 01:02:06,060
Do you have like a magical item you were going to give us? Or is it just that you can control the woods?

1052
01:02:06,060 --> 01:02:10,460
Like I mean it would be really cool if we could have like a like some kind of staff that like yeah

1053
01:02:10,460 --> 01:02:16,500
No, maybe maybe a staff. That's all laughter. Yeah, the snow after the funny stand. Oh, it's

1054
01:02:16,500 --> 01:02:23,800
Yeah, no, it's sort of like when you make the choice, oh, I'll do the good thing, you know

1055
01:02:23,800 --> 01:02:27,000
So we did a good thing. I'm on it

1056
01:02:29,380 --> 01:02:34,140
Well, I don't know what it's too early in the campaign to say whether

1057
01:02:34,140 --> 01:02:41,400
One thing is good or bad, but you know, you rejected the staff. I have nothing to give you yet

1058
01:02:41,400 --> 01:02:45,600
perhaps perhaps if you fight the kitsune's and

1059
01:02:45,600 --> 01:02:51,740
Kill the beast or whatever you want to do the mud men can give you I don't know

1060
01:02:51,740 --> 01:02:56,060
There's all right. Can we have like some of your water at least? Yes

1061
01:02:56,740 --> 01:02:58,860
Did you see what she did in that water?

1062
01:02:58,860 --> 01:03:02,700
That's her house I've been

1063
01:03:02,700 --> 01:03:06,660
I've been in the house. She does a lot of things in there. She had sex with my uncle in there

1064
01:03:06,660 --> 01:03:12,060
Can you at least let me sit in the water and make a make a Shrek farting hot tub?

1065
01:03:12,060 --> 01:03:14,780
Before I leave it's a dream of mine

1066
01:03:14,780 --> 01:03:17,620
I I

1067
01:03:17,620 --> 01:03:20,100
Unfortunately, I'm in your debt

1068
01:03:20,100 --> 01:03:22,780
Nice, I do it

1069
01:03:22,780 --> 01:03:26,500
Yeah, it's and it's awesome. Yeah

1070
01:03:26,500 --> 01:03:27,500
Yep.

1071
01:03:27,500 --> 01:03:37,300
Um, yeah, so she does what she did with the with the fucking warlock where she sort of

1072
01:03:37,300 --> 01:03:43,500
implants in your mind, like the knowledge of where the kitsune are located.

1073
01:03:43,500 --> 01:03:47,260
So you guys can kind of know where to go to get there.

1074
01:03:47,260 --> 01:03:52,820
It's it's definitely like, probably like, you know, it's a big woods and you have to

1075
01:03:52,820 --> 01:04:09,700
to

1076
01:04:09,700 --> 01:04:14,500
to sleep in the pond. Is it alright if we sleep in your house?

1077
01:04:14,500 --> 01:04:18,140
Um, I don't, I don't... We're in your debt.

1078
01:04:18,140 --> 01:04:22,500
Yeah, right. Last thing I remember, you said we were in your debt.

1079
01:04:22,500 --> 01:04:30,300
And I know that, I know that, uh, that whatever his character's name is that I forgot, Evil

1080
01:04:30,300 --> 01:04:35,540
Steve will, uh, you know, pay for it. What the hell? I thought you were my best

1081
01:04:35,540 --> 01:04:37,540
friend

1082
01:04:37,540 --> 01:04:43,260
Yeah, you know I think one of us is gonna have to sleep on it on a couch or somewhere right side

1083
01:04:43,260 --> 01:04:46,420
Yeah, and I'm thinking is dogan. No, I'm

1084
01:04:46,420 --> 01:04:50,500
See, I know your name. You already farted it all up in there

1085
01:04:50,500 --> 01:04:55,860
So I think that you know, you should have to stay outside. You didn't know my name. I've been with you for days

1086
01:04:55,860 --> 01:04:59,280
You have a confusing name. It's very long

1087
01:04:59,280 --> 01:05:02,380
rhymes

1088
01:05:02,380 --> 01:05:04,740
Goblins goblins don't have rhymes

1089
01:05:04,740 --> 01:05:06,740
You fucker.

1090
01:05:06,740 --> 01:05:08,740
Alright.

1091
01:05:08,740 --> 01:05:19,740
Yeah, she sort of watches this sad play between two friends losing touch with one another.

1092
01:05:19,740 --> 01:05:32,740
And she relents, if you want to sleep in my sort of makeshift home, I reserve for when I am entertaining guests, I can at least owe you that.

1093
01:05:32,740 --> 01:05:34,740
You're gonna be entertaining us too?

1094
01:05:34,740 --> 01:05:36,240
No, that's not- I'm not.

1095
01:05:36,240 --> 01:05:38,240
That is amazing! I can't wait to see what you do.

1096
01:05:38,240 --> 01:05:41,740
You would not want- actually, Evil Stevel, you should come down too.

1097
01:05:41,740 --> 01:05:43,740
If there's gonna be entertainment, I want to squash this.

1098
01:05:43,740 --> 01:05:46,240
'Cause I want to enjoy this fully with my friends.

1099
01:05:46,240 --> 01:05:49,740
The woods have just been restored. I have a lot of work to do.

1100
01:05:49,740 --> 01:05:51,740
Yeah, you're damn right! You gotta learn to juggle, bitch!

1101
01:05:51,740 --> 01:05:53,740
[laughter]

1102
01:05:53,740 --> 01:05:55,740
I- I'll- I will-

1103
01:05:55,740 --> 01:05:57,740
Okay, I'll get something together.

1104
01:05:57,740 --> 01:05:59,740
And, uh, you see she like claps her hands.

1105
01:05:59,740 --> 01:06:09,160
hands and out from the pond comes this like giant like conch shell that's like

1106
01:06:09,160 --> 01:06:14,980
a conch shell home. She's like I know it's sea but it's water and I just thematic

1107
01:06:14,980 --> 01:06:19,720
it just worked and so you see there's like a little swirly sort of big thing

1108
01:06:19,720 --> 01:06:23,980
on the top you see inside if you go inside there's sort of like it has a

1109
01:06:23,980 --> 01:06:30,700
beaded curtain and when you go in you see like live love laugh signs and it's wine

1110
01:06:30,700 --> 01:06:36,780
o'clock somewhere you see a lot of like just boyfriend sweaters just laying

1111
01:06:36,780 --> 01:06:43,940
around on the floor. I put them all on over my armor. Hey that last one was my

1112
01:06:43,940 --> 01:06:49,780
uncle's sweater yeah he says it says it says Trudgepole did it.

1113
01:06:49,780 --> 01:06:55,780
Trudgepole did it.

1114
01:06:55,780 --> 01:06:59,780
Yeah that's his calling card after he has sex.

1115
01:06:59,780 --> 01:07:03,780
He turns a sweater inside out.

1116
01:07:03,780 --> 01:07:07,780
He pins it up on the wall.

1117
01:07:07,780 --> 01:07:11,780
It's written in paint.

1118
01:07:11,780 --> 01:07:17,460
He's like, he gets, he leaves the room, he like looks at her and goes, "Now this is happening."

1119
01:07:17,460 --> 01:07:19,700
And just like, you know.

1120
01:07:19,700 --> 01:07:24,220
Cause he's also, he has the sweater on the whole time.

1121
01:07:24,220 --> 01:07:27,780
He doesn't take it off until he leaves.

1122
01:07:27,780 --> 01:07:33,820
He's inside, he's inside her and you see those bledders start to slowly appear, like by magic.

1123
01:07:33,820 --> 01:07:36,220
He's like, "Check it out."

1124
01:07:36,220 --> 01:07:40,580
There's like a carpet and shit like a carpet like a carpet that is a

1125
01:07:40,580 --> 01:07:47,660
Babe, I'm like on the wall like one of those things that girls do if it's like it's like are you sure you can put?

1126
01:07:47,660 --> 01:07:50,140
This on the wall. It seems a little offensive, but they do it anyway

1127
01:07:50,140 --> 01:07:52,660
and

1128
01:07:52,660 --> 01:07:58,200
Yeah, it's a nice nice cozy place got some beanbag chairs and also

1129
01:07:58,200 --> 01:08:03,780
She's gonna bring in some entertainment. So some critters from the woods are gonna come by

1130
01:08:05,340 --> 01:08:08,660
What critters you guys want to come from the three chipmunks

Just to test it out to see if it works yeah, it fills up with water

1137

Evil's a clan

1228
01:15:19,720 --> 01:15:25,700
I think it's time for dinner

1229
01:15:36,360 --> 01:15:41,720
All right now that I've had three square meals I believe that I'm ready to destroy the beast

1230
01:15:41,720 --> 01:15:49,580
Thing maybe actually some dessert might get me on my feet

1231
01:15:49,580 --> 01:15:54,920
Yes, you brings you guys a gun

1232
01:15:54,920 --> 01:16:01,160
Loaded gun for dessert. Come on. Do you care we're gonna do it that oh no

1233
01:16:01,160 --> 01:16:04,800
Say you guys head out to the M

1234
01:16:05,640 --> 01:16:11,640
to towards the the kitsune's and as you sort of start to approach the place

1235
01:16:11,640 --> 01:16:14,640
you have to get a better look at what it looks like.

1236
01:16:14,640 --> 01:16:25,640
So it's you still hear the faint laughter here, you know, when most of the woods now sort of seem kind of normal, but at least where the kitsune's are things are still kind of weird.

1237
01:16:25,640 --> 01:16:29,640
You're still here laughter seeks on sort of weird weird googly

1238
01:16:29,640 --> 01:16:32,940
eye looking critters like, you know, crawling around and shit

1239
01:16:32,940 --> 01:16:38,440
and and and the laughter is sort of like echoing.

1240
01:16:38,440 --> 01:16:42,440
It's now like more real right where before it was sort of

1241
01:16:42,440 --> 01:16:43,840
needling at your subconscious.

1242
01:16:43,840 --> 01:16:47,340
Now, it's like a real laughter and it's like a horrible

1243
01:16:47,340 --> 01:16:51,240
shrieking one like like a hyena except a mad.

1244
01:16:51,240 --> 01:16:51,840
It's instead.

1245
01:16:51,840 --> 01:16:53,740
It's it's it's a kitsune.

1246
01:16:53,740 --> 01:16:55,240
It's not a gestures trick.

1247
01:16:55,540 --> 01:16:56,640
It's very real.

1248
01:16:56,640 --> 01:17:01,640
You see them now the kitsune's you see that they're dressed

1249
01:17:01,640 --> 01:17:03,840
in these cartoonish array of garments that are patched

1250
01:17:03,840 --> 01:17:04,340
together.

1251
01:17:04,340 --> 01:17:08,140
They look like sort of clownish comedians and you see they're

1252
01:17:08,140 --> 01:17:09,240
seven feet tall.

1253
01:17:09,240 --> 01:17:14,740
They're massive long Fox creatures and you see that their

1254
01:17:14,740 --> 01:17:20,340
foxhole home is this giant Technicolor tent that sits above

1255
01:17:20,340 --> 01:17:21,840
like a giant foxhole.

1256
01:17:23,040 --> 01:17:27,840
It looks like a circus tent, but its colors are both like sort of richer and reddier.

1257
01:17:27,840 --> 01:17:30,840
And you can see that it's like it's textured with like weight.

1258
01:17:30,840 --> 01:17:36,140
It's stained with berry juice, dog shit, blood, and then like some natural dyes.

1259
01:17:36,140 --> 01:17:42,040
Like it looks like a circus tent, but it looks like a fucking horrible like mockery of a circus tent.

1260
01:17:42,040 --> 01:17:46,440
And you hear them like going, "AHHHHH!"

1261
01:17:46,440 --> 01:17:51,440
Like just laughing and just fucking skipping around and doing dumb shit.

1262
01:17:51,440 --> 01:17:55,200
And you also see the White Woman of the Woods pressure

1263
01:17:55,200 --> 01:17:58,120
Kubler elves tending to their every whim.

1264
01:17:58,120 --> 01:18:03,120
Their little hands chained, giving them their food

1265
01:18:03,120 --> 01:18:07,680
and rubbing their feet and tending to their whim.

1266
01:18:07,680 --> 01:18:10,520
You see one of them taunt the Kubler elf with a cookie

1267
01:18:10,520 --> 01:18:13,720
and then turns it into a carrot and gives it to him.

1268
01:18:13,720 --> 01:18:19,720
And you also see in the tent a giant beast,

1269
01:18:19,720 --> 01:18:23,000
the Sasquatchian type of beast that the Mudmen were talking about.

1270
01:18:23,000 --> 01:18:27,240
And when you see it though, it looks like a Sasquatch from the back.

1271
01:18:27,240 --> 01:18:31,480
And when you see its face though, it just looks like a human clown.

1272
01:18:31,480 --> 01:18:35,240
And it seems to be having a pretty good time.

1273
01:18:35,240 --> 01:18:38,840
And it's like sort of dancing around and performing for the Kitsunes who are

1274
01:18:38,840 --> 01:18:41,960
laughing and enjoying it. You're all kind of watching this from the bushes.

1275
01:18:41,960 --> 01:18:46,040
And you also see that the clown is attending, that the clownish Sasquatch is

1276
01:18:46,040 --> 01:19:03,160
is

1277
01:19:03,160 --> 01:19:17,040
the

1278
01:19:17,040 --> 01:19:19,480
the

1279
01:19:19,480 --> 01:19:24,320
the

1280
01:19:24,320 --> 01:19:26,880
I'm gonna miss

1281
01:19:26,880 --> 01:19:35,000
You miss you might still you know alarm I'm gonna yeah, what we don't want to do what are they doing does

1282
01:19:35,000 --> 01:19:37,760
Okay, then I'm gonna shoot at the beast

1283
01:19:37,760 --> 01:19:41,320
Good thing don't do anything. Let's talk to them

1284
01:19:41,320 --> 01:19:46,400
Wait, hold on hold on. Can y'all hear me?

1285
01:19:46,400 --> 01:19:53,640
Yeah, so you pop right stop wait, oh don't my friends about to shoot you with an arrow please dodge it

1286
01:19:53,640 --> 01:19:56,680
I got an 11.

1287
01:19:56,680 --> 01:20:03,320
You shoot the arrow into the air and it crests by the beast.

1288
01:20:03,320 --> 01:20:07,560
And what it does, you see the laughter kind of stops and these massive foxes sort of like

1289
01:20:07,560 --> 01:20:08,560
stop cackling.

1290
01:20:08,560 --> 01:20:09,560
Like, "Ahh!"

1291
01:20:09,560 --> 01:20:15,120
And they start looking around to see where that arrow came from.

1292
01:20:15,120 --> 01:20:17,480
Who did that?

1293
01:20:17,480 --> 01:20:19,280
You're just standing in full view.

1294
01:20:19,280 --> 01:20:21,640
Who did that?

1295
01:20:21,640 --> 01:20:23,080
There is an evil guy out here.

1296
01:20:23,080 --> 01:20:38,080
is

1297
01:20:38,080 --> 01:20:57,600
and

1298
01:20:57,600 --> 01:21:01,500
I was going to ask you to try it's going to be a very hard to 23.

1299
01:21:01,500 --> 01:21:02,300
Oh my God.

1300
01:21:02,300 --> 01:21:02,900
Wow.

1301
01:21:02,900 --> 01:21:09,500
They are looking at you and they're like I have the arrow that

1303
01:21:13,400 --> 01:21:16,500
to you and and they're smaller than the other ones actually.

1304
01:21:16,500 --> 01:21:19,000
They're not like a seven foot beast, but you see they're also

1305
01:21:19,000 --> 01:21:22,300
dressed in a jester hat sort of similar to the jester you saw

1306
01:21:22,700 --> 01:21:24,260
the sea look at you

1307
01:21:24,260 --> 01:21:27,060
and uh... it goes uh... uh...

1308
01:21:27,060 --> 01:21:28,660
mining is

1309
01:21:28,660 --> 01:21:31,700
i think it's in a

1310
01:21:31,700 --> 01:21:33,100
say that it had a weird

1311
01:21:33,100 --> 01:21:37,060
named by c_n_n_ soon a bussy keats in a

1312
01:21:37,060 --> 01:21:39,020
in

1313
01:21:39,020 --> 01:21:42,620
okay there's a bad guy outs out in the woods somewhere in the shooting bow and

1314
01:21:42,620 --> 01:21:45,260
arrows and you shot an arrow at us

1315
01:21:45,260 --> 01:21:49,900
that is not what he what he talking about man that is not that is for i'm going to

1316
01:21:49,900 --> 01:22:16,900
and

1317
01:22:16,900 --> 01:22:25,740
radiance yeah okay so uh you guys want to roll for initiative yeah let's do it

1318
01:22:25,740 --> 01:22:34,060
nine five I'm getting bad initiative man why are my rolls bad now so the second

1319
01:22:34,060 --> 01:22:46,860
you guys roll for initiative the you see you hear like almost in like

1320
01:22:46,860 --> 01:22:51,140
in your mind's eye like now from like the white woman in the woods and you see

1321
01:22:51,140 --> 01:22:55,980
other animals now appearing from the woods bears and lions and tigers and all

1322
01:22:55,980 --> 01:23:01,620
these critters oh my yeah oh yeah jumping out and like attacking many of

1323
01:23:01,620 --> 01:23:07,260
the other kitsune you still have a group of them and Bussie in front of you but

1324
01:23:07,260 --> 01:23:13,660
you see now why she wanted the yoni egg because a full frontal assault is

1325
01:23:13,660 --> 01:23:20,220
actually plausible maybe for you guys now. And so yeah, you have some distance from

1326
01:23:20,220 --> 01:23:24,860
them. You're about 60 feet from this like crowd of them and you see the beast is

1327
01:23:24,860 --> 01:23:30,100
batting away these like bears and tigers and shit fighting among the other

1328
01:23:30,100 --> 01:23:34,860
kitsune and you see the Dean and Luca Vegas brothers are like cowering as

1329
01:23:34,860 --> 01:23:39,300
they're tied to the pole. You see the Kubler elves are like running away

1330
01:23:39,300 --> 01:23:46,300
trying to hide, trying not to get hurt. But yeah, so it's gonna be Bussy Kitsune's turn

1331
01:23:46,300 --> 01:23:58,300
first. And they're gonna take a blow dart and shoot it at you, Patrick G. O'Dar. Don't do

1332
01:23:58,300 --> 01:24:00,300
Don't do that. Let's see how that goes.

1333
01:24:00,300 --> 01:24:05,500
Okay, what is your AC?

1334
01:24:05,500 --> 01:24:06,500
14.

1335
01:24:06,500 --> 01:24:08,400
Okay, it misses you.

1336
01:24:08,400 --> 01:24:09,500
You see it.

1337
01:24:09,500 --> 01:24:14,000
You see it like sail past you and then you see two other

1338
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:17,600
kitsune's now are going to sort of run up run up on you guys.

1339
01:24:17,600 --> 01:24:19,500
One of them is going to go for you Dogen.

1340
01:24:19,500 --> 01:24:22,100
The other one's going to go for you evil Stevel and they have

1341
01:24:22,100 --> 01:24:31,220
these very colorful looking bo staves that they're sort of spinning around and going

1342
01:24:31,220 --> 01:24:32,920
after you with them.

1343
01:24:32,920 --> 01:24:40,160
So first Dogen, that misses you, and now you.

1344
01:24:40,160 --> 01:24:41,780
Evil Steevel, that's a hit.

1345
01:24:41,780 --> 01:24:42,780
Oh yeah.

1346
01:24:42,780 --> 01:24:43,780
How much?

1347
01:24:43,780 --> 01:24:44,780
It does 4 damage.

1348
01:24:44,780 --> 01:24:48,660
He just sort of spins it at you and just whaps you on the side of the head.

1349
01:24:48,660 --> 01:24:50,820
That's nothing to me.

1350
01:24:50,820 --> 01:24:52,820
And now it is your turn, Dogen.

1351
01:24:52,820 --> 01:24:55,820
Okay, how many are nearby?

1352
01:24:55,820 --> 01:25:00,820
You have two that are near you, near you guys.

1353
01:25:00,820 --> 01:25:03,820
One that's in range of you with your melee weapon.

1354
01:25:03,820 --> 01:25:05,820
You have Bussi Kitsune who's in the back.

1355
01:25:05,820 --> 01:25:08,820
You have one more behind Bussi that hasn't gone yet.

1356
01:25:08,820 --> 01:25:10,820
And you have another one that's on Evil Steeble.

1357
01:25:10,820 --> 01:25:15,820
And then obviously whatever happens at the carnage in the back, you know, there could be more.

1358
01:25:15,820 --> 01:25:16,820
be more.

1359
01:25:16,820 --> 01:25:17,820
Yeah.

1360
01:25:17,820 --> 01:25:18,820
Okay.

1361
01:25:18,820 --> 01:25:22,220
Um, well, since there's one right next to me, I don't want to, I would like to help Steve,

1362
01:25:22,220 --> 01:25:24,780
but I don't want to get an attack of opportunity on me.

1363
01:25:24,780 --> 01:25:28,100
So I'm just going to hit that guy with my, my shovel.

1364
01:25:28,100 --> 01:25:30,700
Um, that's six.

1365
01:25:30,700 --> 01:25:31,700
Yeah.

1366
01:25:31,700 --> 01:25:34,100
You just like, it's just, he's just too fast.

1367
01:25:34,100 --> 01:25:39,060
And it's like, like, just like happily dodging your attacks.

1368
01:25:39,060 --> 01:25:43,020
Um, uh, and uh, yeah, it's now your turn.

1369
01:25:43,020 --> 01:25:44,540
Patrick, Patrick Yodar.

1370
01:25:44,540 --> 01:25:56,420
is

1371
01:25:56,420 --> 01:26:08,860
the

1372
01:26:08,860 --> 01:26:23,860
Adam

1373
01:26:23,860 --> 01:26:29,060
sword in a circle. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Like link. Yeah, it's

1374
01:26:29,060 --> 01:26:32,820
like it's like Kermit the Frog's arms like you know when

1375
01:26:32,820 --> 01:26:36,180
he's excited, he goes like yeah. Alright, I'm doing that

1376
01:26:36,180 --> 01:26:39,220
with my sword. Yeah, it's just doesn't really have to move too

1377
01:26:39,220 --> 01:26:45,780
much. Yeah. And now it is actually mister the frog's turn

1378
01:26:45,780 --> 01:26:55,680
So he's going to try to do fairy fire on Basakitsune, who's going to try to avoid it.

1379
01:26:55,680 --> 01:26:59,180
What is happening?

1380
01:26:59,180 --> 01:27:01,980
Yeah, I don't know what's going on.

1381
01:27:01,980 --> 01:27:07,080
So to give people at home context, Solven's spell save is like a nine.

1382
01:27:07,080 --> 01:27:12,680
So it's very easy to get out of the way, but people keep not getting out of the way.

1383
01:27:14,180 --> 01:27:18,680
So yeah, yeah, Busty Kitsune is like covered in the fairy fire.

1384
01:27:18,680 --> 01:27:20,180
You have advantage on attacks against them.

1385
01:27:20,180 --> 01:27:24,080
And now is Evil Stevels turn.

1386
01:27:24,080 --> 01:27:26,580
I'm just going to use my mace.

1387
01:27:26,580 --> 01:27:28,780
I think go for it on the one who's close to me.

1388
01:27:28,780 --> 01:27:30,280
Yeah, do it do it up.

1389
01:27:30,280 --> 01:27:31,580
Fuck.

1390
01:27:31,580 --> 01:27:32,880
Yeah, 17.

1391
01:27:32,880 --> 01:27:35,380
Yeah, it's okay.

1392
01:27:35,380 --> 01:27:37,280
Roll for the damage.

1393
01:27:37,280 --> 01:27:39,580
One.

1394
01:27:42,280 --> 01:27:43,400
that's a

1395
01:27:43,400 --> 01:27:44,720
down on a heater tonight

1396
01:27:44,720 --> 01:27:47,360
yeah i'm not sure how to scratch it with the

1397
01:27:47,360 --> 01:27:49,520
like the way that it is

1398
01:27:49,520 --> 01:27:52,320
and that's just a sample of what's going to happen

1399
01:27:52,320 --> 01:27:53,900
to you if we keep fighting

1400
01:27:53,900 --> 01:27:55,120
but

1401
01:27:55,120 --> 01:27:57,640
the

1402
01:27:57,640 --> 01:27:59,120
uh...

1403
01:27:59,120 --> 01:28:00,280
okay cool

1404
01:28:00,280 --> 01:28:02,660
uh... or date at the top of the order

1405
01:28:02,660 --> 01:28:03,380
uh...

1406
01:28:03,380 --> 01:28:05,000
and uh...

1407
01:28:05,000 --> 01:28:08,200
uh... yes of the fight is on you know the sort of already kind of you guys are

1408
01:28:08,200 --> 01:28:09,760
already going at each other

1409
01:28:09,760 --> 01:28:16,160
and you see way in the back by the tents where the clown sort of beast is.

1410
01:28:16,160 --> 01:28:25,360
You see it is fighting off these other beasts and stuff and you see it picking up

1411
01:28:25,360 --> 01:28:33,040
Dean and Luca Vegas and just using them as like swords as it's whacking things around.

1412
01:28:35,120 --> 01:28:42,880
and you see it sort of look to the three of you and hold one of them out towards you like

1413
01:28:42,880 --> 01:28:48,880
a blade like you're next and I kind of want to end it there.

1414
01:28:48,880 --> 01:28:52,880
So I'll end in the middle of the spread.

1415
01:28:52,880 --> 01:28:54,880
I don't know if that's...

1416
01:28:54,880 --> 01:28:56,880
I'm scared.

1417
01:28:56,880 --> 01:29:00,880
All time, within the past, present and future

1418
01:29:00,880 --> 01:29:03,880
Man has sought to destroy

1419
01:29:03,880 --> 01:29:06,880
All that's giving away

1420
01:29:06,880 --> 01:29:11,880
