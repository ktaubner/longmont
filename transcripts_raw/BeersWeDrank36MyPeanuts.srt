1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
I hit play.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:07,800
Wait, I'm into the next level.

3
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:12,560
Nope. I'm floating dragon. Yeah, stop that man. Yes, we gotta record now.

4
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:15,960
Trying to make art here man. You're fucking it up.

5
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:16,460
[record scratch]

6
00:00:16,460 --> 00:00:18,460
[music]

7
00:00:18,460 --> 00:00:21,840
What's up all my chuggers?

8
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:23,840
I'm trying to get that burp out.

9
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:25,840
[burp]

10
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:27,840
[music]

11
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:29,840
I'm a Heineken, Bud Light, Ha!

12
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:30,840
Foo Riven!

13
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:31,840
I don't die.

14
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:32,840
Beers we drank, motherfucker.

15
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:34,840
With Juvio, Caleb, and Rex.

16
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:36,840
Beer.

17
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:38,840
Welcome back!

18
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:40,840
Welcome back, y'all.

19
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:44,840
And hello to all of my beautiful Gophers, guys.

20
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:45,840
It's Gopher October.

21
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:46,840
In November.

22
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:48,840
Gopher remember-member.

23
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:49,840
Gopher remember.

24
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:51,840
And what do we have today, guys?

25
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:53,840
Well, I'll start because I'm the Gopher.

26
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:54,840
We have...

27
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:56,840
We have Gopher remember.

28
00:00:56,840 --> 00:01:03,320
I like that write that down. We have a Heineken 0.0 actually let me try that again.

29
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:10,040
Oh guys yeah sober, sober gopher November is over man. Yeah that's right I got a Heineken.

30
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:15,240
Yeah Heineken 0.0 I fooled you.

31
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:19,640
But if it's like 0.09 how pissed would you be?

32
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:24,840
Don't be insane if they're just lying about there not being any alcohol in it.

33
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:26,840
I think that it's...

34
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:28,840
Oh, this says alcohol free. I don't know how that's...

35
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:33,840
Every other non-alcoholic beer I've gotten says that it's .5% or lower.

36
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:36,840
I don't know how this one, they got it to actually be zero.

37
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:41,840
But, listen, even one drop of alcohol is horrific poison for your body that will destroy you slowly.

38
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:43,840
Mentally and spiritually.

39
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:45,840
That is true.

40
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:47,840
I'm gonna give this a sip.

41
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:49,840
Well, rather, I just did.

42
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:53,840
And, guys, this is one of the best non-alcoholic beers.

43
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:58,240
beers i'm going crazy today i think this is one of the best non-alcoholic beers in the world let

44
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:03,840
me tell you why i'm going crazy guys oh real quick before you get to your beers last night

45
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:15,200
last night i was fully a gopher gofering around we went to a new jazz bar that came up right down

46
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:22,720
the street for right in my neighborhood brand new and uh it was so delightful it's called da da

47
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:32,720
And what are the crossroads? 60th and Myrtle Avenue. Okay. Da-da. They have live jazz. I went with my

48
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:38,880
wife, Noah, and his girlfriend. My wife. We got a charcuterie board and I was thinking, "Man,

49
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:43,680
I'm gonna eat the charcuterie board." Little did I know Noah wanted to give me a cocktail and he

50
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:48,960
ordered me a black Manhattan and I lost my gopher status for one hour and it made me feel so sick

51
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:55,960
and so drunk to drink one drink because I've ridded my alcohol, my body of alcohol so much.

52
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:59,600
And then I got home and I felt sick and I took Dayquil and then I woke up and I had one of

53
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:02,320
the worst hangovers of my entire life from one drink and Dayquil.

54
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:05,320
Are you still fully sick?

55
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:06,320
Yeah.

56
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:11,280
Yeah, no insurance in my life so I can't go get antibiotics for what is clearly a sinus

57
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:15,240
infection all my snot is Nickelodeon slime green.

58
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:16,240
Ew.

59
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:18,840
Yeah, so it's really, it's not been that good for me.

60
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:22,760
But guys, Heineken Zero is nursing me back to health.

61
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:23,880
I was wondering when--

62
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:25,200
Delicious malt beverage.

63
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:26,200
When this day was gonna come

64
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:27,920
where you had the Heineken Zero,

65
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:32,920
since it's known to be one of the best alcohol-free beers.

66
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:34,600
I love it, Heineken Zero is amazing.

67
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:36,560
I'm gonna give this five out of five peanuts

68
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:37,960
on the Gopher scale.

69
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:39,600
And the Gopher's--

70
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:40,860
What's the seed?

71
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:41,880
The Gopher, I don't know.

72
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:43,600
The Gopher's popping out of his hole today

73
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:44,920
to drink this Heineken.

74
00:03:44,920 --> 00:04:09,400
I am drinking a Brooklyn Brewing Bel Air Sour.

75
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:11,320
A tropical sour.

76
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:21,080
new. Delightful. That sounds delightful. Give me the notes. You have sour, obviously. A

77
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:29,360
little sour, but unlike a sour monkey, it has half the alcohol in it, so it's just pleasurable

78
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:37,120
to drink. Oh, that's nice. We have a normal 5% beer. 5.8. Okay, so give me a numerical

79
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:44,120
rating

80
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:54,880
nice

81
00:04:54,880 --> 00:05:00,920
yeah

82
00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:03,440
I got a...

83
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:05,360
We all have poppers today!

84
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:06,360
Popper bottles!

85
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:07,560
I popped my bottle.

86
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:09,020
We're popping our bottles.

87
00:05:09,020 --> 00:05:09,900
And I got a...

88
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:11,560
It's actually kind of weird.

89
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:13,220
It's got a weird label on it.

90
00:05:13,220 --> 00:05:14,480
It says 1906.

91
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:16,400
But it's a...

92
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:20,140
It's a Estrella Galicia, I think.

93
00:05:20,140 --> 00:05:22,360
It's like a Spanish beer from Spain.

94
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:25,780
This is like a special reserve type of thing.

95
00:05:25,780 --> 00:05:27,900
It came in like a little fancy box.

96
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:34,560
this is actually a beer that my girlfriend got for her birthday and I stole one

97
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:37,540
so this is a legal contraband beer

98
00:05:37,540 --> 00:05:41,240
what does that say about your girlfriend that she gets beer for her birthday?

99
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:42,300
she likes it

100
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:43,640
oh I don't like it though

101
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:45,600
what the hell

102
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:48,520
maybe you're the woman in the relationship

103
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:51,080
guys this is foolish

104
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:54,680
actually you're in a relationship with a man and you're the girl

105
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:59,160
Yeah, this is she gets a beer for her boy for her birthday and you

106
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:07,160
Sneak a little sip. Oh look only because you're the girlfriend and girlfriend's like stealing stuff. Yeah, i'm gonna keep going with my

107
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:14,680
Walk around the house so rudely interrupted I do like wearing my big hoodie and walking out with my pennies

108
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:16,680
uh guys

109
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:17,720
I

110
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:18,680
I liked

111
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:25,680
We had a little streak going of drinking nice light beers that I love drinking because they don't taste much like beer.

112
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:31,680
But this is full on. This is a full on beer. I would like to call it a...

113
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:35,680
Yeah, that's what I would call it. Full power beer.

114
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:38,680
A full power beer. Fully loaded.

115
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:41,680
Fully loaded, fully flavored and I don't like it.

116
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:45,680
It's a little... I think it's a 6.5%

117
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:53,980
I just got off the notes of a disgusting beer that I wouldn't like to drink.

118
00:06:53,980 --> 00:06:56,360
It doesn't, I guess- This is not a 10 million.

119
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:58,400
No, this is not a 10 million.

120
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:00,240
I think I would go with a one.

121
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:03,280
Out of 10.

122
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:08,840
It's so frustrating.

123
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:09,840
It really is.

124
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:15,960
This pisses me off more than it should that you refuse to adhere to a very simple set

125
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:18,000
of rating rules that we have come...

126
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Like a rubric.

127
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,480
There's no one foot tall person.

128
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:22,480
There's no one...

129
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:23,480
It's a streak.

130
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:28,640
It's a baby that ran into the court.

131
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:29,640
That's not a player.

132
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:30,720
They don't count.

133
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:31,720
They don't say...

134
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:35,720
And now a baby is on the court and they don't pass to the...

135
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:37,200
The baby's not playing, man.

136
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:39,440
And the baby runs on the...

137
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:46,440
would

138
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:53,440
a

139
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:55,440
Do you pass to him?

140
00:07:55,440 --> 00:08:00,440
Doing like a Steve Nash no look pass and just exploding the baby.

141
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:03,440
I'm not gonna lie, I would pass it to the baby.

142
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:04,440
That would be so funny.

143
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:08,440
If you pass it, if you, if a baby ran onto the court in an NBA game and you passed it to the baby,

144
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:11,440
you would be, you would be completely kicked out of the league.

145
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:13,440
You'd be playing in China in one week too.

146
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:15,440
You can't pass it to the baby.

147
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:16,440
Follow me.

148
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:18,440
Even if the baby scores, they're not.

149
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:20,440
Here's a, here's an old Chinese joke.

150
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:26,840
You pass it to the baby and then the baby passes it into the river because it's a girl. How about that?

151
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:28,520
I don't understand.

152
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:29,960
Baby passes the ball?

153
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:34,600
It passes away in the river. It's drowned. The baby drowned.

154
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:37,000
Wait, how's that Chinese?

155
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:41,960
Is that the kind of joke that we're doing on this show now? Is jokes about infanticide?

156
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:44,040
I'm sorry.

157
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:44,840
That's what we think.

158
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:46,600
I'm having a hard time, okay?

159
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:48,200
Why are you having a hard time?

160
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:48,520
I'm just...

161
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:49,160
What's going on?

162
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:51,160
The work is so busy, dude.

163
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:52,160
Tell us all about it.

164
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:54,160
I do not want to.

165
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:55,160
But I just, you know.

166
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:56,160
But do it anyway.

167
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:57,160
Honestly, man, I don't want to hear it.

168
00:08:57,160 --> 00:08:58,160
My brain is completely mush.

169
00:08:58,160 --> 00:08:59,160
You have a fully nerd job.

170
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:01,160
I don't want to have anything to do with that.

171
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:02,160
Yeah.

172
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:07,160
My brain is mush because in addition to being a gopher this October.

173
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:09,160
Why do I keep thinking it's October, man?

174
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:10,160
It's November.

175
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:11,160
That's how much...

176
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:12,160
Our brains are completely mush.

177
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:14,160
In addition to being a gopher this November.

178
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:16,160
Well, yours was always mush.

179
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:17,160
True.

180
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:22,160
I have been waking up at 7 in the morning.

181
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:23,160
Oh my.

182
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:24,160
Clap.

183
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:25,160
Thank you.

184
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:26,160
Thank you.

185
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:30,360
I've been waking up at 7 in the morning and I've been going to the gym and I've been,

186
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:37,240
before I go to do my weight lifting, I go, and I do that at 11 o'clock, I go at 7 in

187
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:41,120
the morning and I go and I run for an hour.

188
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:45,640
And this has been one of the worst decisions I think I've ever made in my entire life.

189
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:46,640
It's so cold.

190
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:49,600
It's very, very cold.

191
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:50,600
It's very hard to do.

192
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:51,600
What are you doing at 8am, at 7am?

193
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:55,720
Why don't you just wake up like an hour or two earlier?

194
00:09:55,720 --> 00:10:01,400
Because it feels like that's a good time to wake up, especially now that the sun goes away

195
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:05,600
at 445, I wanted to have a little bit more sunlight in my life, so I've been waking up

196
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:06,600
early.

197
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:09,760
And I thought that I was going to get used to it in like a week, and I have not gotten

198
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:10,760
used to it.

199
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:13,160
Every day, waking up is so fucking hard, man.

200
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:14,160
I think a...

201
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:15,160
Oh, let's get in here.

202
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:17,160
I think 8am is the GOAT.

203
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:20,660
You think 8am is the GOAT?

204
00:10:20,660 --> 00:10:22,660
I think 8am is the GOAT.

205
00:10:22,660 --> 00:10:24,660
8am might be the GOAT.

206
00:10:24,660 --> 00:10:26,660
I like 7 because you feel a little better than everybody else.

207
00:10:26,660 --> 00:10:28,660
Listen, I don't want to obscure you, but I woke up today fully at 4am.

208
00:10:28,660 --> 00:10:30,660
There's no reason for that.

209
00:10:30,660 --> 00:10:32,660
Why'd you do that?

210
00:10:32,660 --> 00:10:34,660
Dog.

211
00:10:34,660 --> 00:10:36,660
I drove hot tonight to the airport.

212
00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:38,660
That is not...

213
00:10:38,660 --> 00:10:40,660
That doesn't count, man.

214
00:10:40,660 --> 00:10:42,660
Yeah, that's bullshit.

215
00:10:42,660 --> 00:10:44,660
Everybody's had to do that.

216
00:10:44,660 --> 00:10:48,580
You're not, uh, you said upscaling me. You're not upscaling me.

217
00:10:48,580 --> 00:10:52,820
I'm special and I'm upscaling you and I'm not camping and I

218
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:56,020
I tried to go back to sleep but I just couldn't. So I was just like you know

219
00:10:56,020 --> 00:10:59,460
what fuck it I'll just go I'll just feed the dog and I'll go on my little walk.

220
00:10:59,460 --> 00:11:04,900
I am, guys, I know I'm usually your host but I know when you think of

221
00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:08,660
lead man, think of front man, you think of me but

222
00:11:08,660 --> 00:11:11,540
today I just simply cannot carry that burden.

223
00:11:11,540 --> 00:11:15,540
Today I have a dog that I have to take care of that I fully lost already.

224
00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:17,540
She left the room and I don't know where she is.

225
00:11:17,540 --> 00:11:22,540
I saw her walk out. She's on to a better, newer life, man. Just let her go.

226
00:11:22,540 --> 00:11:24,540
She doesn't like hanging out with me, is what I've noticed.

227
00:11:24,540 --> 00:11:26,540
If you love her, let her go.

228
00:11:26,540 --> 00:11:30,540
No, she hates me fully. I've told her teacher to not bite me.

229
00:11:30,540 --> 00:11:32,540
I'm trying to teach her that right now.

230
00:11:32,540 --> 00:11:35,540
But there's several issues with that.

231
00:11:35,540 --> 00:11:38,540
Number one, she's a puppy and she's one day old and she likes to bite.

232
00:11:38,540 --> 00:11:40,540
Not so smart.

233
00:11:40,540 --> 00:11:41,540
She has...

234
00:11:41,540 --> 00:11:42,540
Can you see that?

235
00:11:42,540 --> 00:11:43,540
I don't know if you can see that.

236
00:11:43,540 --> 00:11:44,540
No.

237
00:11:44,540 --> 00:11:45,540
It's just a little white.

238
00:11:45,540 --> 00:11:48,700
Oh, I actually see a scratch, I do.

239
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:56,140
She has long-ass puppy nails and she just likes to, you know, get on top of you and she scratched

240
00:11:56,140 --> 00:12:03,500
the fucking shit out of me and I feel really hurt and I want to explain to her in English

241
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:05,740
why she shouldn't do that.

242
00:12:05,740 --> 00:12:09,140
That's probably your first mistake is speaking to a dog in English.

243
00:12:09,140 --> 00:12:16,140
in

244
00:12:16,140 --> 00:12:18,180
zero. I just have to say I love these things.

245
00:12:18,180 --> 00:12:19,540
What does it, wait, what does it taste like?

246
00:12:19,540 --> 00:12:22,660
It tastes exactly like a Heineken.

247
00:12:22,660 --> 00:12:25,620
I have never had a Heineken. So this is not,

248
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:29,740
it's one to one. It tastes like a, like a light beer. It's a nice,

249
00:12:29,740 --> 00:12:32,380
maybe it's a, you would like it. I think it would be a tumbler.

250
00:12:32,380 --> 00:12:33,420
If I was a gopher.

251
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:38,260
I almost bought like a big Heineken today for the show.

252
00:12:38,260 --> 00:12:40,860
I should have, we should have coordinated.

253
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:44,820
The last alcoholic drink I had, uh,

254
00:12:44,940 --> 00:12:50,380
for october it was on halloween i was feeling so sick and i was like but you know what man

255
00:12:50,380 --> 00:12:55,180
if i'm gonna be a gopher for a whole month i gotta have one last beer and so i got a tall

256
00:12:55,180 --> 00:13:01,100
boy heineken and that's cheating that's like i gotta have one last meal and then you get like

257
00:13:01,100 --> 00:13:08,860
you know a bucket of chicken from kfc what that's a good meal how's that cheating good meal

258
00:13:10,140 --> 00:13:12,540
Well, that's too big. That's too big for one meal.

259
00:13:12,540 --> 00:13:15,840
That's too big for one beer.

260
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:17,340
You can have one big meal.

261
00:13:17,340 --> 00:13:20,740
If it was your last meal though, one last meal, of course you'd do a big meal.

262
00:13:20,740 --> 00:13:23,740
Okay, wait, hang on. Before we keep going with this,

263
00:13:23,740 --> 00:13:26,040
Rex, you are dying tomorrow.

264
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:28,940
You have one last meal you can eat tonight.

265
00:13:28,940 --> 00:13:29,740
What are you eating?

266
00:13:29,740 --> 00:13:31,740
Probably the Forever Feast.

267
00:13:31,740 --> 00:13:35,340
Okay.

268
00:13:35,340 --> 00:13:37,440
That is not a thing, by the way.

269
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:38,940
Okay, what's the Forever Feast?

270
00:13:39,140 --> 00:13:41,140
It's a Mr. Beast.

271
00:13:41,140 --> 00:13:43,140
Mr. Beast?

272
00:13:43,140 --> 00:13:45,140
Mr. Beast Feast?

273
00:13:45,140 --> 00:13:47,140
You would eat a Mr. Beast Feast?

274
00:13:47,140 --> 00:13:49,140
Mr. Beast Forever Feast.

275
00:13:49,140 --> 00:13:51,140
Okay, what is the...

276
00:13:51,140 --> 00:13:53,140
What are you talking... What is a Forever Feast?

277
00:13:53,140 --> 00:13:55,140
It's a...

278
00:13:55,140 --> 00:13:57,140
It's like a... It's a plate that never gets empty.

279
00:13:57,140 --> 00:13:59,140
You keep eating and it just refills itself.

280
00:13:59,140 --> 00:14:01,140
Well, but you...

281
00:14:01,140 --> 00:14:03,140
Okay, but you...

282
00:14:03,140 --> 00:14:05,140
What's on... What is in the...

283
00:14:05,140 --> 00:14:07,140
You have to stop eating at midnight.

284
00:14:07,140 --> 00:14:14,140
food

285
00:14:14,140 --> 00:14:18,140
uh... whereas the u_s_ very simple question

286
00:14:18,140 --> 00:14:22,820
what if you could eat if you had been you have to do not need after midnight

287
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:26,480
because it's not that day anymore to last day you can eat

288
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:30,720
for a week will say that i don't want to catch my food

289
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:34,340
what is the problem with that you can't be a good i know that it's a forever

290
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:39,300
Feast. Things keep popping up but what's in the Forever Feast man you're pissing me off so much.

291
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:44,740
I have a new question don't answer the food one. How much is the drink also forever or

292
00:14:44,740 --> 00:14:50,180
does do you only have like a one glass of water? You just get one small glass of water.

293
00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:56,500
That's fucked up. That's a fucked up thing to do someone. Mr. Beast is torturing you.

294
00:14:56,500 --> 00:15:04,260
He is. That's what he is. He's the torturer. He is fully a torturer. Did you see the people

295
00:15:04,260 --> 00:15:19,740
the

296
00:15:19,740 --> 00:15:34,740
the

297
00:15:34,740 --> 00:15:40,980
so crazy racist man i'm trying to be in the office reboot i can't be next to you guys in a recorded

298
00:15:40,980 --> 00:15:48,020
video man i'm not racist you're right you're not at all but i think that once i once they

299
00:15:48,020 --> 00:15:54,980
i talked to a homeless woman the other day really and i followed her around to buy her things whoa

300
00:15:54,980 --> 00:16:02,100
oh okay you took a homeless lady on a shopping spree well she uh she tried because at first

301
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:06,420
she came up to me and she was like, "Can I get some milk for my baby?" and I was like,

302
00:16:06,420 --> 00:16:11,220
"There's no way that's real." But in the off chance it is, I would, you know, be remiss

303
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:19,540
if I missed the opportunity to help a starving black baby. But then she was like, they didn't

304
00:16:19,540 --> 00:16:23,940
have anything and she's like, "Can I get some headphones so I can listen to my baby?"

305
00:16:23,940 --> 00:16:25,540
I was like, I mean...

306
00:16:25,540 --> 00:16:25,860
What?

307
00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:26,420
What the hell?

308
00:16:26,420 --> 00:16:27,860
And then they didn't have...

309
00:16:27,860 --> 00:16:31,700
A TV to watch my baby and a massage chair to massage my baby?

310
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:35,900
And then they didn't have headphones, so she was like, "Can I just get, like, the thing to file your nails?"

311
00:16:35,900 --> 00:16:37,560
Okay.

312
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:38,060
Okay.

313
00:16:38,060 --> 00:16:38,560
*laughter*

314
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:40,320
This is so strange.

315
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:43,480
Number one, why do you think that...

316
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:48,880
I think if someone were to ask me for milk instead of money, I would be like, "Oh yeah, you probably have a baby."

317
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:53,160
You should have squirted some just out of your nipples right at her.

318
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:54,820
There you go.

319
00:16:54,820 --> 00:16:56,000
That's right.

320
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,080
Open your hands up.

321
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:59,080
That's my last meal. It's my own milk.

322
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:00,180
That's not your last meal.

323
00:17:00,180 --> 00:17:01,640
I'm thinking about breast milk a lot.

324
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:03,640
you already picked one of those

325
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:08,520
Yeah, I think that if one day my wife gets pregnant and we have a baby, I think I have

326
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:09,520
to try it.

327
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:10,520
I mean, yeah, you have to.

328
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:13,800
I don't think it's that weird to do that.

329
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:15,320
I think it's completely weird.

330
00:17:15,320 --> 00:17:21,280
I think it's completely weird and wrong, but I'm just too, I watch too much Nitro Circus

331
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:23,440
and the Dudesons and Jackass growing up.

332
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:24,440
Would you store it in bottles?

333
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:27,440
That's the kind of thing I think I'd have to do.

334
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:29,000
Would I store it in bottles?

335
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,000
Yeah.

336
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:35,000
- Yes, but I would get like Grand Marnier,

337
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:40,040
like nice bottles and keep the breast milk in there.

338
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:42,920
- Yeah, like a Don Julio 1942 bottle.

339
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:45,560
- Yeah, 1942, exactly.

340
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:48,680
Like nice, I'd get, and I'd have a top shelf

341
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:50,520
where I keep all of it, unrefrigerated.

342
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:51,360
- Okay, so you'd be--

343
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:52,860
- And then I'd pop it open, pour it on the rocks

344
00:17:52,860 --> 00:17:54,760
for my child, because that's the kind of thing

345
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:56,280
that I'm gonna be training him to do.

346
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:58,240
- I thought you were gonna say that you were gonna be

347
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:02,160
showing out like proud that yeah we got this shit right here and i'm drinking it

348
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:08,080
instead of like just oh i it's a private stash it's in the fridge and i just oh i just grabbed

349
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:12,960
the bat by accident i watched i re-watched that la beast video the other day where he

350
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:20,160
leaves a gallon of milk outside for a month and then he drinks it and uh that's got to be one of

351
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:26,000
the greatest videos of all time he throws up inside of his washing machine because he did not have the

352
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,680
for the foresight

353
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:31,240
think about the fact that

354
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:34,880
completely separated thirty day old milk might make him vomit

355
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:37,560
so he did not have a bag next to him

356
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:42,280
so instead he has to reason is garage in his to run to his washing machine and

357
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:44,080
throw up into the side of it

358
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:46,680
i think he's the smartest guy alive

359
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:49,840
i think he's a g_m_ is definitely uh... genius

360
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:51,340
filmmaker

361
00:18:51,340 --> 00:18:53,440
there's no doubt to me about that

362
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:53,940
It is crazy that he-

363
00:18:53,940 --> 00:18:55,700
He is a- a- a complete auteur.

364
00:18:55,700 --> 00:18:59,520
Do you think he's got like the most insane, um...

365
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:02,060
Like insurance of all time?

366
00:19:02,060 --> 00:19:04,800
Because he's- he's done some insane stuff, like he's seen like

367
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:08,020
Whole cacti, he's- he's drank like poison basically.

368
00:19:08,020 --> 00:19:14,120
I think that there's basically no way that any insurance company would possibly cover him.

369
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:16,880
I think he's gotta be like a cyborg or some shit.

370
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:17,540
That keeps like-

371
00:19:17,540 --> 00:19:21,040
That has to be- when you fill out an insurance form for Blue Cross Blue Shield

372
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:27,240
and you fill out occupation and your occupation is eating cactus and expired cereal from 50

373
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:31,240
years ago, I think your premiums go way the fuck up.

374
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:38,240
Yeah, I'd be pissed. I'd be like, I'm paying for this guy to get better.

375
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:45,240
I think you have a better chance writing down Alaskan crab fisherman than I'm the LA beast.

376
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:49,120
I feel like there's no way that, I mean, he's got to be, his insurance premium is probably

377
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:54,280
$70,000 a month because there's no way that anybody would would cover that.

378
00:19:54,280 --> 00:20:01,500
You're losing money. Yeah there should be like the guy that gets hurt for work. I

379
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:07,400
think more people should just be tortured for money. Remove the work element.

380
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:12,480
Remove like like people shouldn't be filling out spreadsheets anymore. We've

381
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:18,240
got computers that do that for us. They should just be like electrocuted. Yeah but

382
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:25,240
for

383
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:30,880
blood almost. Like you go and you get electrocuted for just as long as you can and then you get

384
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:36,580
paid for it. I agree. Because I don't think that we need, I think that we should not be

385
00:20:36,580 --> 00:20:43,020
living in communism socialism, this destroys Christianity, it shouldn't exist. But I do

386
00:20:43,020 --> 00:20:47,620
think that people shouldn't have to work because working is really really hard. But if you

387
00:20:47,620 --> 00:20:53,020
can take, if you can withstand thousands of volts of electricity pulsing through your body

388
00:20:53,020 --> 00:20:55,860
and making your skeleton blue and pop out and flash,

389
00:20:55,860 --> 00:20:57,620
then yeah, dude, you should be making money.

390
00:20:57,620 --> 00:21:01,400
- My first thought on this is I would completely do it.

391
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:03,300
My second thought is, would you guys come with me

392
00:21:03,300 --> 00:21:04,660
to do this job with me?

393
00:21:04,660 --> 00:21:08,380
- And like, come with you and also do it?

394
00:21:08,380 --> 00:21:09,540
Probably not.

395
00:21:09,540 --> 00:21:10,380
I don't like getting hurt very much.

396
00:21:10,380 --> 00:21:12,040
- How much do you think they should get paid

397
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:16,220
to be 40 hours in the torture chamber?

398
00:21:16,220 --> 00:21:18,080
- 40 straight hours of torture,

399
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:19,300
or like eight hour shifts?

400
00:21:19,300 --> 00:21:20,700
- Eight hour shifts.

401
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:22,060
- Well, it depends on the country.

402
00:21:22,060 --> 00:21:25,060
9 to 5, you know, break for lunch.

403
00:21:25,060 --> 00:21:28,060
Did you know that the work week in Mexico is 48 hours?

404
00:21:28,060 --> 00:21:30,060
Really?

405
00:21:30,060 --> 00:21:33,060
It's a big debate right now going on. They're trying to make it 40.

406
00:21:33,060 --> 00:21:37,060
You guys do a 6 hour work or 10 hour work days?

407
00:21:37,060 --> 00:21:41,060
I think we just work the entire week plus Saturday.

408
00:21:41,060 --> 00:21:43,060
Oh, okay.

409
00:21:43,060 --> 00:21:45,060
I think that's what it's supposed to be like.

410
00:21:45,060 --> 00:21:50,060
It was a whole thing with my old job, like office job.

411
00:21:50,060 --> 00:21:54,580
that I technically worked like half a day on Saturdays,

412
00:21:54,580 --> 00:21:57,700
but I never actually worked any Saturday.

413
00:21:57,700 --> 00:22:01,140
But when it comes to the vacation days,

414
00:22:01,140 --> 00:22:05,820
they take one day, one extra day off of your days

415
00:22:05,820 --> 00:22:10,180
if you are asking for a Saturday vacation day as well.

416
00:22:10,180 --> 00:22:13,020
- That's wrong, man.

417
00:22:13,020 --> 00:22:13,860
- That is wrong.

418
00:22:13,860 --> 00:22:16,760
But anyways, I wouldn't do the electrocution job in Mexico

419
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:17,820
if that was the case.

420
00:22:17,820 --> 00:22:19,860
- Well, it doesn't necessarily have to be--

421
00:22:19,860 --> 00:22:33,340
the

422
00:22:33,340 --> 00:22:40,340
water

423
00:22:40,340 --> 00:22:47,700
on

424
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:54,700
ever

425
00:22:54,700 --> 00:22:57,540
if that if that was what i was getting paid for dude

426
00:22:57,540 --> 00:23:00,620
i'd work i'd work a hundred hours a week i'd be catching doubles i'd be picking

427
00:23:00,620 --> 00:23:05,460
up shifts from other guys who didn't have a white forehead to have a date

428
00:23:05,460 --> 00:23:09,340
and i think it was just

429
00:23:09,340 --> 00:23:10,480
i'd be telling i mean

430
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:14,620
i'd pride bore a hole in my head with the water that because i don't care

431
00:23:14,620 --> 00:23:15,780
my forehead

432
00:23:15,780 --> 00:23:17,580
i'll sit there in any even if it's like

433
00:23:17,580 --> 00:23:20,540
as okay as long as i could sit there and listen to

434
00:23:20,540 --> 00:23:22,120
you to videos

435
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:24,960
about uh... drama between different

436
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:26,440
uh... three years

437
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:29,160
no phones man

438
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:30,760
well that's it's own kind of torture

439
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:35,260
that's what that's a course in a similar house rules

440
00:23:35,260 --> 00:23:38,900
you have to be a little bit you bring your phone and record

441
00:23:38,900 --> 00:23:39,800
the the

442
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:41,760
bad working conditions and amazon

443
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:42,720
uh... but

444
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:44,980
record the piss bottles and shit

445
00:23:44,980 --> 00:23:49,000
now this is a little bit of this week and be on your phone

446
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:53,080
i did think earlier i walked by one of those people who is uh... doing that

447
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:57,820
amazon prime deliveries with and have that blue box that bag box thing

448
00:23:57,820 --> 00:23:59,140
yes

449
00:23:59,140 --> 00:24:00,720
and

450
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:05,040
i think there's almost no world where if i work that job for a year i wouldn't at

451
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:06,700
some point

452
00:24:06,700 --> 00:24:11,240
during my route have to take a shit in that box

453
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:13,380
i think that that box would get

454
00:24:13,380 --> 00:24:14,780
a shit in it

455
00:24:14,780 --> 00:24:20,440
so fast if i was a m_l_ for better breaks when you're in the road

456
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:23,700
what do you do it if you if you're a delivery man yeah and i'm trying to

457
00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:25,260
position just ask

458
00:24:25,260 --> 00:24:26,900
people if you can shit

459
00:24:26,900 --> 00:24:28,860
and their house

460
00:24:28,860 --> 00:24:33,040
uh... you never had a m_ is on gas giving take a shit no i have not

461
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:34,700
really

462
00:24:34,700 --> 00:24:37,420
pretty much every time they deliver something as you think take a shit my

463
00:24:37,420 --> 00:24:38,260
apartment

464
00:24:38,260 --> 00:24:40,820
are you serious what do you say yet did

465
00:24:40,820 --> 00:24:42,580
so yeah man i'm a nice guy

466
00:24:42,580 --> 00:24:49,580
that

467
00:24:49,580 --> 00:24:52,860
Notice that they leave their boxes.

468
00:24:52,860 --> 00:24:53,860
They're like blue.

469
00:24:53,860 --> 00:24:55,860
Yeah, they're everywhere.

470
00:24:55,860 --> 00:24:56,860
Yeah.

471
00:24:56,860 --> 00:24:59,860
So, clearly you can just take a shit in it.

472
00:24:59,860 --> 00:25:00,860
Yeah, just leave it.

473
00:25:00,860 --> 00:25:02,940
What's this blue box that you guys are talking about?

474
00:25:02,940 --> 00:25:03,940
I don't...

475
00:25:03,940 --> 00:25:07,280
I think in cities, because they'll park on a block and then they have a bunch of packages

476
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:08,740
to deliver on the block.

477
00:25:08,740 --> 00:25:10,620
So instead of drive up every...

478
00:25:10,620 --> 00:25:11,620
Oh, it's like a crate.

479
00:25:11,620 --> 00:25:12,620
...to every address.

480
00:25:12,620 --> 00:25:18,100
Yeah, they have like a crate that they put on their back.

481
00:25:18,100 --> 00:25:24,820
what you like death stranding and they have to walk down the block and try to get there.

482
00:25:24,820 --> 00:25:31,060
That's messed up. I think New York is the best city in the world because you can just drive

483
00:25:31,060 --> 00:25:37,780
around and you can just watch a movie on your car. That is true. My brother-in-law,

484
00:25:37,780 --> 00:25:44,740
maybe I shouldn't say this, he just had a child. My brother-in-law, he went to school in Georgia

485
00:25:44,740 --> 00:25:48,740
and he would drive up to North Carolina a lot for like family events and stuff

486
00:25:48,740 --> 00:25:51,340
and every single time I'd be like "Hey, how was the drive?"

487
00:25:51,340 --> 00:25:54,140
It's like an 8 hour drive, he'd be like "It was good, I watched two movies."

488
00:25:54,140 --> 00:25:59,440
So he was driving on the highway with his phone on the steering wheel

489
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:05,140
and he would just watch Guardians of the Galaxy, the entire thing.

490
00:26:05,140 --> 00:26:06,140
That's badass, dude.

491
00:26:06,140 --> 00:26:07,640
I've done that.

492
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:12,240
I used to do that with my old car that didn't have like Apple CarPlay

493
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:14,800
But it was so I just had like maps on my phone.

494
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:19,280
I would just like drive like this basically just holding the like totally like this.

495
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:21,040
So I get that I could I could do that.

496
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:22,480
I could do that today.

497
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:24,680
I was sorry.

498
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:25,040
Go ahead.

499
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:36,280
One time I dropped Julio off at the airport and I watched like some video for like 40 minutes while I was in traffic in LA.

500
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:44,240
on the way home

501
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:51,400
to people who get that anymore?

502
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:57,760
uh...

503
00:26:57,760 --> 00:27:00,040
wow

504
00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:02,480
but i feel like you'd be safe

505
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:05,720
the it's the most obvious defense ever

506
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:07,440
I was on Google Maps, man.

507
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:08,880
Right.

508
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:09,680
I'm sorry, officer.

509
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:11,920
I was on Google Maps trying to figure out where to go.

510
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:13,960
Trying to figure out which side of the street I was going to drive.

511
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:15,520
Did it, like, check?

512
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:17,520
All right, let me see your last three apps.

513
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:19,320
I can't go through your phone, man.

514
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:21,240
Let me look at your last three apps.

515
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:22,640
No, they can go through your phone.

516
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:23,480
No, they can't.

517
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:23,960
Yeah, they can.

518
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:26,040
You have to have a warrant to go through a telephone.

519
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:27,400
I don't think that's true.

520
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:28,960
That is 100% true.

521
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:31,880
OK, I will believe you because I don't actually know.

522
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:34,880
You have to have a warrant to go through a telephone,

523
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:37,760
any kind of digital thingy.

524
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:40,000
So if you have a digital thing on you,

525
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:43,040
then, and they say, I wanna touch your digital stuff,

526
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:45,920
you have to say, where's your warrant, fool?

527
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:46,840
Where's your warrant, pig?

528
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:48,480
- Okay, so you're just out of shadow of the law,

529
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:51,640
then he'll just assume that you're not on NAPL maps.

530
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:54,440
- Don't try me on the police knowledge, dude.

531
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:57,360
I watch videos all day and night that are--

532
00:27:57,360 --> 00:27:59,880
- And you've got your car towed.

533
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:03,080
- Auditing, dude, have you seen these videos

534
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:26,640
were

535
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:41,720
share

536
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:48,700
Amazing dude. Yeah, I think it's amazing. These type of videos like one that I heard about like also like years ago

537
00:28:48,700 --> 00:28:53,800
We're just a guy to just recording like while he's walking and she's like go set a business

538
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:59,600
It's just recording a lady and then she gets he gets like pissed and then those are the clips

539
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:06,760
I usually end up on like current fucking Karen 2033 company compilation. Yeah, I guess man guess where these videos never take place

540
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:10,120
Your house, Los Angeles, California

541
00:29:10,120 --> 00:29:11,120
California.

542
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:12,120
That's true.

543
00:29:12,120 --> 00:29:17,040
Because in that city, it's full of actors who are actually grateful for any screen time

544
00:29:17,040 --> 00:29:18,440
that they could possibly get.

545
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:20,360
Don't play it, Karen.

546
00:29:20,360 --> 00:29:23,680
Don't play anybody, dude.

547
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:29,480
So these guys, if they really want, if they want to not get beat up or called awful names,

548
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:34,240
like White, which happens in a lot of the videos, "Hey, you're White," then they should

549
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:36,600
be going to Los Angeles and walking around East LA.

550
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:38,800
Yeah, well they don't go cameras, but they got all those like

551
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:46,240
High speed chase videos they come out every that is true every two weeks. There's a lot of car chases in Los Angeles

552
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:52,720
That's kind of cool. Do the guys ever get away? I feel like once you get the helicopter out you can't do it

553
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:56,880
It's really hard yeah

554
00:29:56,880 --> 00:30:03,240
There is have you seen that one video where the guy like he gets out of the car and he's like on foot and

555
00:30:03,820 --> 00:30:08,740
And then the helicopter is like on it, so he's not really gonna get away

556
00:30:08,740 --> 00:30:13,900
but there's like cops looking around for him and then he like hides behind a car and

557
00:30:13,900 --> 00:30:16,740
They like completely just like lose line

558
00:30:16,740 --> 00:30:27,560
And the newsman is like oh my god, they can't even see him right now they're completely walking right by him

559
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:32,700
The second it's so fucking awesome

560
00:30:32,700 --> 00:30:33,700
awesome.

561
00:30:33,700 --> 00:30:38,540
I uh, my, it's a tragic story.

562
00:30:38,540 --> 00:30:43,260
I don't think I've talked about this on a show, but there's, I know I've sent the video to

563
00:30:43,260 --> 00:30:51,540
Jubio, but there's a video that's called like, the worst tragedies in like news history or

564
00:30:51,540 --> 00:30:52,540
something.

565
00:30:52,540 --> 00:30:53,540
Oh my god.

566
00:30:53,540 --> 00:30:54,540
And like, did I send it to you?

567
00:30:54,540 --> 00:30:56,220
I don't think so.

568
00:30:56,220 --> 00:31:01,640
There's one of them is like, one of them is like apparently there was a car chase in LA

569
00:31:01,640 --> 00:31:07,240
there was two different helicopters that were following it and they crashed into

570
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:15,360
each other live on air. No. It's a really crazy story but the funniest the funny

571
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:21,160
thing is in the video uh-huh the guy is like the guy who's making the video he

572
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:27,500
has that that youtuber like story voice where he's like right and after the

573
00:31:27,500 --> 00:31:33,020
Tragedy the worst part was that because it was live on air a lot of the victims

574
00:31:33,020 --> 00:31:37,840
Closest friends had to react to it live on air leading to some very tragic

575
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:41,060
reactions and then it

576
00:31:41,060 --> 00:31:43,900
slowly fades in a clip of a guy going

577
00:31:54,660 --> 00:31:58,260
I'm gonna find this clip right now. I'm just gonna play it out of my phone.

578
00:31:58,260 --> 00:31:59,260
I know I have it.

579
00:31:59,260 --> 00:32:02,460
Did the guy get away with it?

580
00:32:02,460 --> 00:32:04,460
Uh, I don't know. I did...

581
00:32:04,460 --> 00:32:05,460
I quickly...

582
00:32:05,460 --> 00:32:10,760
Once I found out about the helicopters colliding, I quickly lost interest in the actual chase.

583
00:32:10,760 --> 00:32:13,260
I think that's one of the ways that you get out...

584
00:32:13,260 --> 00:32:14,260
You get away with it.

585
00:32:14,260 --> 00:32:15,660
The...

586
00:32:15,660 --> 00:32:19,460
The helicopters crash.

587
00:32:19,460 --> 00:32:19,960
Here it is.

588
00:32:19,960 --> 00:32:23,960
disturbing or the darkest moments in TV history 3.

589
00:32:23,960 --> 00:32:27,960
Tell me if you can hear this.

590
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:35,960
News stations swarmed to cover the crash.

591
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:39,960
With many of those people forced to cover the incident being acquaintances and even good friends.

592
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:43,960
Within people they had just watched perish.

593
00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:47,960
Leading to some genuinely heartbreaking reactions.

594
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:49,960
Oh no, oh Jesus!

595
00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:51,960
Oh gosh!

596
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:53,960
Oh my gosh!

597
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:55,960
Hey!

598
00:32:55,960 --> 00:32:57,960
Holy crap!

599
00:32:57,960 --> 00:32:59,960
Oh gosh!

600
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:01,960
Oh my gosh!

601
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:03,960
What?

602
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:05,960
Wait, but you know what? Is that guy like some relative of the

603
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:07,960
helicopter people?

604
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:09,960
No, he was like a guy

605
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:11,960
who worked at the news station

606
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:13,960
with one of the guys, or like the radio station.

607
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:15,960
Right.

608
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:19,820
Finds it. Holy crap, you know and in that scenario

609
00:33:19,820 --> 00:33:24,020
I would have kept my cool if Rex was up there and you kill it were up there also and

610
00:33:24,020 --> 00:33:28,600
And you were both in the helicopters you crashing you died. It would cut back to me and I will be like

611
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:31,740
Guys we have to quit

612
00:33:31,740 --> 00:33:35,660
Here wait, let's just hold on. Oh, let's play it out completely. Okay, okay

613
00:33:35,660 --> 00:33:40,740
Rex you're in one helicopter. I'm in the other we're both on the radio with with GPO right now, right?

614
00:33:42,380 --> 00:33:46,260
It looks like the cat is still stuck in the tree. We're rotating around

615
00:33:46,260 --> 00:33:50,900
We have an amazing angle on the cat that's stuck in the tree Rex. How are you doing over there? Oh, man?

616
00:33:50,900 --> 00:33:54,480
It's so good. I've got a perfect view of this cat at this angle wait

617
00:33:54,480 --> 00:34:00,140
You're coming a little close here. I can't hear you right now Rex the kitty cat is looking completely adorable. Oh my god

618
00:34:00,140 --> 00:34:04,100
There's a fireman there, and he looks buff. He should be on a calendar wait wait. What's that?

619
00:34:04,100 --> 00:34:07,600
The giant black thing that is covering all my vision

620
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:15,920
*Funkmaster flexing*

621
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:20,160
We cut to me, ladies and gentlemen, we have to go to commercial right now.

622
00:34:20,160 --> 00:34:23,120
That's how we handle it.

623
00:34:23,120 --> 00:34:26,560
There we go. That's a professional newsman.

624
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:28,080
I don't think you're being honest.

625
00:34:28,080 --> 00:34:29,600
What do you mean?

626
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:32,560
I think you would probably immediately cry.

627
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:34,080
Not true.

628
00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:35,600
Okay, well here's a test.

629
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:42,400
Okay, well first we have to do the commercials. Okay? Okay, safe light repair safe light replace. Okay now fade in

630
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:44,400
Do you know?

631
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:50,640
He doesn't want to get emotional he doesn't want to get emotional. Did you know that they make that jingle for every language in the planet?

632
00:34:50,640 --> 00:34:54,040
Do you do yours right now do the Mexican one?

633
00:34:54,040 --> 00:34:57,200
I saw a video

634
00:34:57,200 --> 00:34:58,840
I don't know why I watch the entire video

635
00:34:58,840 --> 00:35:04,120
I watched an entire video of them doing that jingle and like at least like 30 to 40 languages and

636
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:08,840
And they're all over the world, it's so crazy, but I don't know the Spanish one.

637
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:11,840
I think the Spanish one is bad, I think the French one is okay.

638
00:35:11,840 --> 00:35:13,140
Uh...

639
00:35:13,140 --> 00:35:15,640
I think the English one is also okay. - The English one is definitely the best one.

640
00:35:15,640 --> 00:35:17,040
I think so.

641
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:20,940
Okay, so the commercials are fading away, and now you have to go live, dude.

642
00:35:20,940 --> 00:35:24,640
You can't air commercials for an hour, okay?

643
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:26,640
Okay, we'll do 30 minutes of commercials.

644
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:29,440
No, okay, 30 minutes is up. You've had 30 minutes to recover.

645
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:33,740
But now you have to be live as your two best friends have just died in an awful...

646
00:35:33,740 --> 00:35:35,740
Air-mobile accident.

647
00:35:35,740 --> 00:35:38,460
Ladies and gentlemen, earlier today we erred.

648
00:35:38,460 --> 00:35:39,900
We, uh, we erred.

649
00:35:39,900 --> 00:35:41,900
We erred.

650
00:35:41,900 --> 00:35:43,900
Okay, so you both are dead.

651
00:35:43,900 --> 00:35:45,900
*laughter*

652
00:35:45,900 --> 00:35:47,900
He's watching Sean Paul.

653
00:35:47,900 --> 00:35:49,900
We erred.

654
00:35:49,900 --> 00:35:51,900
Dr. Prudner.

655
00:35:51,900 --> 00:35:55,900
The hell, man.

656
00:35:55,900 --> 00:35:57,900
You are such a bad liar.

657
00:35:57,900 --> 00:35:59,900
So you are both dead anyways.

658
00:36:01,580 --> 00:36:04,300
I wish I was dead so I didn't have to hear you.

659
00:36:04,300 --> 00:36:05,980
I'm older as the radio ad.

660
00:36:05,980 --> 00:36:07,980
We heard my friend died, man.

661
00:36:07,980 --> 00:36:12,940
We heard my friend died and I left my car, man.

662
00:36:12,940 --> 00:36:15,340
What the hell is wrong with you?

663
00:36:15,340 --> 00:36:16,300
Completely unprofessional.

664
00:36:16,300 --> 00:36:18,940
Can you guys hear the awesome banging?

665
00:36:18,940 --> 00:36:20,700
Yeah, bro.

666
00:36:20,700 --> 00:36:23,500
I think I'm gonna ask them to come just hammer my walls.

667
00:36:23,500 --> 00:36:25,980
You have bangers downstairs that bang?

668
00:36:25,980 --> 00:36:26,800
Yeah.

669
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:28,460
I don't know.

670
00:36:28,460 --> 00:36:32,460
The lady, the people downstairs like moved out.

671
00:36:32,460 --> 00:36:35,420
They had some like crazy setup.

672
00:36:35,420 --> 00:36:39,940
We thought they were selling some sort of drugs

673
00:36:39,940 --> 00:36:43,700
because they were so insane and also no one liked them.

674
00:36:43,700 --> 00:36:45,220
But at some point they got--

675
00:36:45,220 --> 00:36:46,820
- I don't drive anybody to drugs.

676
00:36:46,820 --> 00:36:48,380
- I think they got kicked out.

677
00:36:48,380 --> 00:36:51,460
And we asked about that apartment.

678
00:36:51,460 --> 00:36:53,480
We're like, no, we're gonna give it to someone else.

679
00:36:53,480 --> 00:36:56,540
And all day it's been just nothing but banging.

680
00:36:56,540 --> 00:36:59,940
and I mean I'm just trying to take care of this dog here.

681
00:36:59,940 --> 00:37:01,820
She's fully dead.

682
00:37:01,820 --> 00:37:03,220
If you can see here.

683
00:37:03,220 --> 00:37:04,500
Oh, you can't see that.

684
00:37:04,500 --> 00:37:05,460
- I can't see that. - Yeah, I can't see that.

685
00:37:05,460 --> 00:37:06,660
There's a monitor in the way.

686
00:37:06,660 --> 00:37:07,700
- There's a fully dead-- - Oh, she looks dead,

687
00:37:07,700 --> 00:37:10,220
actually, yeah. - There's a fully dead dog.

688
00:37:10,220 --> 00:37:11,940
- There's a white guy in the way.

689
00:37:11,940 --> 00:37:14,980
- There is a big white guy, a big white Sasquatch.

690
00:37:14,980 --> 00:37:15,860
- That's not true.

691
00:37:15,860 --> 00:37:20,660
- All right, wait, I gotta go get another Heineken 00, man.

692
00:37:20,660 --> 00:37:22,060
You guys talk about--

693
00:37:22,060 --> 00:37:24,220
- How many does your third one?

694
00:37:24,220 --> 00:37:26,220
My third dude, they're only...

695
00:37:26,220 --> 00:37:30,620
Oh my god, there's six, there's seventy calories, Jesus Christ.

696
00:37:30,620 --> 00:37:32,620
Well, I'll have one more.

697
00:37:32,620 --> 00:37:38,380
Oh my goodness, that's so many calories.

698
00:37:38,380 --> 00:37:40,380
Zero times three equals zero.

699
00:37:40,380 --> 00:37:41,420
Yeah, but that's...

700
00:37:41,420 --> 00:37:43,420
Okay, well actually, I think you're right.

701
00:37:43,420 --> 00:37:44,700
He needs cleansing.

702
00:37:44,700 --> 00:37:49,180
I think once we get to awesome Drinksgiving,

703
00:37:49,180 --> 00:37:51,900
he will be cleansed of this gopher nastiness.

704
00:37:52,540 --> 00:37:57,260
I don't want to mention it when he's around, but I think he's got a gopher problem.

705
00:37:57,260 --> 00:37:58,860
I could hear you the whole time.

706
00:37:58,860 --> 00:37:59,860
Oh shit.

707
00:37:59,860 --> 00:38:01,300
Yeah, he has wireless headphones.

708
00:38:01,300 --> 00:38:03,460
You think it's wrong to be a gopher, man?

709
00:38:03,460 --> 00:38:07,300
Also, why are you talking shit about your friends behind their back?

710
00:38:07,300 --> 00:38:08,900
Yeah, what the hell?

711
00:38:08,900 --> 00:38:11,540
Just tell it to me straight.

712
00:38:11,540 --> 00:38:13,780
First you want them to be dead so they can't hear you.

713
00:38:13,780 --> 00:38:15,100
Now you want them to be outside.

714
00:38:15,100 --> 00:38:20,820
Ladies and gentlemen, earlier today we heard two of my coworkers die in a fiery crash on

715
00:38:20,820 --> 00:38:23,500
on a cat related news coverage.

716
00:38:23,500 --> 00:38:26,660
And we simply have to apologize

717
00:38:26,660 --> 00:38:29,180
for putting you all through that.

718
00:38:29,180 --> 00:38:33,780
We were really close friends with those two correspondents.

719
00:38:33,780 --> 00:38:35,440
But now let's go for the weather.

720
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:36,280
I heard it's gonna be-

721
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:38,000
- You would not go straight to the weather.

722
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:38,840
And the weather, by the way,

723
00:38:38,840 --> 00:38:41,900
would be flaming arms and legs are falling out of the sky.

724
00:38:41,900 --> 00:38:42,740
- That would not be the weather.

725
00:38:42,740 --> 00:38:44,100
- And people's soups.

726
00:38:44,100 --> 00:38:46,140
People are trying to eat big bowls of bread,

727
00:38:46,140 --> 00:38:48,460
bowls of soup outside of a Panera bread,

728
00:38:48,460 --> 00:38:51,740
and caleb's toes and fingers are falling into it

729
00:38:51,740 --> 00:38:53,700
you will not explode explode that bigly

730
00:38:53,700 --> 00:38:55,760
i would say

731
00:38:55,760 --> 00:39:00,460
dude i'm so big they would be finding pieces of me

732
00:39:00,460 --> 00:39:02,540
for

733
00:39:02,540 --> 00:39:03,980
also i'm so lightweight

734
00:39:03,980 --> 00:39:06,580
right so you're just gonna float and

735
00:39:06,580 --> 00:39:09,060
it would literally be it would block

736
00:39:09,060 --> 00:39:12,220
sunlight crops would die all over the country

737
00:39:12,220 --> 00:39:16,140
because of how many particles of me are blocking the sun i think your parts would get

738
00:39:16,140 --> 00:39:16,880
crushed

739
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:20,120
and turn into dust and just blow into the air.

740
00:39:20,120 --> 00:39:23,240
- Dude, wait, here's your worst nightmare though.

741
00:39:23,240 --> 00:39:27,160
So the camera feed is still on somehow, right?

742
00:39:27,160 --> 00:39:28,640
Or maybe your best nightmare.

743
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:30,000
The camera feed is still on.

744
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:33,120
It's a GoPro that we were filming with.

745
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:34,720
These things are indestructible.

746
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:38,920
The camera is just looking at the ground,

747
00:39:38,920 --> 00:39:39,760
kind of half at the ground,

748
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:42,160
Cloverfield style angle, kind of tilted.

749
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:43,000
- Right.

750
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,640
- Looking at the rubble and the rubbish.

751
00:39:45,640 --> 00:40:00,640
the

752
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:04,640
completely perfectly merged because our bodies are so aligned.

753
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:05,640
Yes.

754
00:40:05,640 --> 00:40:11,440
Half of our bodies are gone on either side and we are now down the middle, two-faced,

755
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:12,440
split perfectly.

756
00:40:12,440 --> 00:40:13,440
Calyx?

757
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:14,440
Yeah.

758
00:40:14,440 --> 00:40:18,080
And our penis looks really odd.

759
00:40:18,080 --> 00:40:24,840
I don't want to just keep pitting at that horse, but do you think that Calyx would have

760
00:40:24,840 --> 00:40:27,640
the most insane come over of all time?

761
00:40:27,640 --> 00:40:28,640
Yes.

762
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:30,240
There would be no choice.

763
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:32,240
Well all the hair got burned off in the accident.

764
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:34,240
Yeah, we just smoked a bottle of gin.

765
00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:34,740
Okay.

766
00:40:34,740 --> 00:40:35,240
Yeah.

767
00:40:35,240 --> 00:40:39,240
But I would feel less bad about it.

768
00:40:39,240 --> 00:40:41,240
Would you chill out with Kalix?

769
00:40:41,240 --> 00:40:42,240
Yeah, for sure.

770
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:43,740
Really?

771
00:40:43,740 --> 00:40:45,240
I think Kalix would...

772
00:40:45,240 --> 00:40:49,240
I think Raylo would lose it really quickly.

773
00:40:49,240 --> 00:40:51,240
What do you mean lose it?

774
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:58,240
I think Raylo would fall to the class of gambling so, so quickly.

775
00:40:59,240 --> 00:41:02,280
because you're both addicted to gambling in a crazy degree.

776
00:41:02,280 --> 00:41:04,800
And if you multiply that by two, I think--

777
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:06,080
- I don't even gamble, man.

778
00:41:06,080 --> 00:41:07,820
- I was about to disagree with you,

779
00:41:07,820 --> 00:41:12,820
but there is literally big windboard tabs on both sides.

780
00:41:12,820 --> 00:41:15,880
- So yeah, so this is you holding back.

781
00:41:15,880 --> 00:41:17,840
You're like, "Oh, I'm just looking at it.

782
00:41:17,840 --> 00:41:20,600
I'm just like playing fake money."

783
00:41:20,600 --> 00:41:22,760
Raylib just goes--

784
00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:25,120
- Raylib, you might be right.

785
00:41:25,120 --> 00:41:26,160
You might be right.

786
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:30,320
Yeah, yeah, Raylob with Rex's bankroll.

787
00:41:30,320 --> 00:41:31,840
Yeah, it'd be over, man.

788
00:41:31,840 --> 00:41:33,520
Actually, we don't even have to imagine that.

789
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:36,320
I think we have a almost--

790
00:41:36,320 --> 00:41:38,040
maybe not perfect Raylob.

791
00:41:38,040 --> 00:41:40,040
But I think Brian's already there.

792
00:41:40,040 --> 00:41:41,760
I think Raylob is perfect.

793
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:43,880
Yeah, I don't think you can get better than Raylob.

794
00:41:43,880 --> 00:41:45,960
Do you nurse Raylob back to health?

795
00:41:45,960 --> 00:41:46,960
Mm-hmm.

796
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:49,000
That's the real question if you're a real friend.

797
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:51,440
Like, what does he need?

798
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:53,680
He needs uppies.

799
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:54,640
You don't need uppies.

800
00:41:54,640 --> 00:41:56,120
You've never asked for uppies.

801
00:41:56,120 --> 00:42:01,560
I've seen you at least five times, I think.

802
00:42:01,560 --> 00:42:04,280
And not once have you asked for uppies.

803
00:42:04,280 --> 00:42:06,440
Next time that you see me, you're giving me an uppie.

804
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:07,780
Just one.

805
00:42:07,780 --> 00:42:08,780
See if we both like it.

806
00:42:08,780 --> 00:42:10,920
What if we really like it?

807
00:42:10,920 --> 00:42:12,480
I think I'm giving you an uppie.

808
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:14,440
Here's the thing.

809
00:42:14,440 --> 00:42:19,080
Does the Ray part of Raylib want an uppie?

810
00:42:19,080 --> 00:42:20,080
That's up to Ray.

811
00:42:20,080 --> 00:42:21,480
Yeah, give me an uppie.

812
00:42:21,480 --> 00:42:22,480
Now.

813
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:23,480
Okay.

814
00:42:23,480 --> 00:42:24,480
All right.

815
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:33,680
instant. Are you stupid? Why wouldn't I want an uppy? I'm fucking fused with another man.

816
00:42:33,680 --> 00:42:42,040
What dignity do I have left? Get me up now. Who do you think would be more upset with

817
00:42:42,040 --> 00:42:53,240
that half and half transformation? Probably your significant others. The most obnoxious

818
00:42:53,240 --> 00:43:00,240
this

819
00:43:00,240 --> 00:43:05,140
us. That is true. They have a lot of freedom. I know that my wife would be like, "You know

820
00:43:05,140 --> 00:43:12,640
what man? I always thought Rex was such a hot piece of ass dude. I couldn't hide it." It

821
00:43:12,640 --> 00:43:18,980
be like me with hair. Yeah. We got burnt off. Oh you're right. Well it'll grow back. We'll

822
00:43:18,980 --> 00:43:24,100
get a... Well but now that we have the... Once we're gambling, we'll make enough money to

823
00:43:24,100 --> 00:43:27,420
get a full hair transplant. Right. And you know what? Maybe we'll just cover our entire

824
00:43:27,420 --> 00:43:28,980
hair bodies with hair and become a...

825
00:43:28,980 --> 00:43:30,580
Has somebody done that?

826
00:43:30,580 --> 00:43:32,300
Go to Turkey and tell the person,

827
00:43:32,300 --> 00:43:34,260
like, "I want to be Bigfoot."

828
00:43:34,260 --> 00:43:36,260
- I think that's impossible to do.

829
00:43:36,260 --> 00:43:37,100
- Shut up, bitch!

830
00:43:37,100 --> 00:43:38,580
- Why would that be impossible?

831
00:43:38,580 --> 00:43:41,020
- I think, well, I don't think it's impossible.

832
00:43:41,020 --> 00:43:43,500
I think it's impossible to do it that way.

833
00:43:43,500 --> 00:43:45,940
I don't think the Turkey man is gonna be like,

834
00:43:45,940 --> 00:43:48,860
"All right, I'm gonna put things in your entire body."

835
00:43:48,860 --> 00:43:50,940
I think the only way to do that is just to bathe

836
00:43:50,940 --> 00:43:53,380
in minoxidil for days.

837
00:43:53,380 --> 00:43:57,060
- I don't think that's how that works.

838
00:43:57,060 --> 00:44:04,060
know

839
00:44:04,060 --> 00:44:07,180
a bunch of follicles so I need a follicular transplant

840
00:44:07,180 --> 00:44:10,640
they're gonna have to take follicles from somebody and put them in my

841
00:44:10,640 --> 00:44:14,680
over my entire body turn me into a full Sasquatch and then I'll start scaring

842
00:44:14,680 --> 00:44:15,280
people

843
00:44:15,280 --> 00:44:18,380
I'm basically hairless so

844
00:44:18,380 --> 00:44:22,240
I've no chest hair there's nothing going on there

845
00:44:22,240 --> 00:44:28,600
there's no follicles to take yeah me too dude I'm completely just a nubile

846
00:44:28,600 --> 00:44:43,600
the

847
00:44:43,600 --> 00:44:51,400
how I have such a low threshold for feeling like like how bad I have to feel

848
00:44:51,400 --> 00:44:55,200
to be like okay I'm canceling all of my plans and I'm going to take a four-hour

849
00:44:55,200 --> 00:44:59,800
bath like like an old lady who has like chronic Lyme disease like that's how I

850
00:44:59,800 --> 00:45:06,080
treat that's how I am and that's why I exercise and stuff so I wonder if I felt

851
00:45:06,080 --> 00:45:12,480
even like on your best day eating and drinking what you do that is true how

852
00:45:12,480 --> 00:45:15,120
How long I would make it, I think. I don't know.

853
00:45:15,120 --> 00:45:20,960
I genuinely haven't felt good in like years.

854
00:45:20,960 --> 00:45:22,240
Yeah.

855
00:45:22,240 --> 00:45:23,360
You know?

856
00:45:23,360 --> 00:45:26,560
Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's a good thing to say. Yeah.

857
00:45:26,560 --> 00:45:29,520
Not in like a "Oh, I'm so depressed."

858
00:45:29,520 --> 00:45:34,240
No, but like the stuff in your body is affecting you in a way every single day.

859
00:45:34,240 --> 00:45:35,120
Yeah.

860
00:45:35,120 --> 00:45:37,920
I think my depression and my anxiety have been making my-

861
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:58,920
my

862
00:45:58,920 --> 00:46:07,800
I'm at the computer. My daily carry I do keys, phone, wallet. I have uh wired headphones. Yep.

863
00:46:07,800 --> 00:46:12,440
And that's it man. Do you think it's crazy to go? I don't even take my wallet outside most of the

864
00:46:12,440 --> 00:46:15,960
time. I was about to ask you do you think it's crazy to go outside without wearing your wallet

865
00:46:15,960 --> 00:46:23,560
and like any ID on you? I only know I only bring my wallet if I'm going to if I'm going to be out

866
00:46:23,560 --> 00:46:28,840
for like all day. Right. I'll bring my wallet but if I'm going to do one thing I never bring my wallet.

867
00:46:28,840 --> 00:46:43,840
the

868
00:46:43,840 --> 00:46:45,840
I don't have my phone on me.

869
00:46:45,840 --> 00:46:47,840
Wait, guess I do.

870
00:46:47,840 --> 00:46:49,840
Hold on.

871
00:46:49,840 --> 00:46:51,840
Yeah.

872
00:46:51,840 --> 00:46:53,840
I've actually, so far.

873
00:46:53,840 --> 00:46:55,840
Can you see this?

874
00:46:55,840 --> 00:46:57,840
Is this like...

875
00:46:57,840 --> 00:46:59,840
Well, it's not, it doesn't show anything, like, important.

876
00:46:59,840 --> 00:47:01,840
It's a little blown up.

877
00:47:01,840 --> 00:47:03,840
It's a little blown up.

878
00:47:03,840 --> 00:47:05,840
It's a little blown up.

879
00:47:05,840 --> 00:47:07,840
It's a little blown up.

880
00:47:07,840 --> 00:47:09,840
It's a little blown up.

881
00:47:09,840 --> 00:47:11,840
It's a little blown up.

882
00:47:11,840 --> 00:47:13,840
It has a photo of you?

883
00:47:13,840 --> 00:47:15,080
It doesn't even show that.

884
00:47:15,080 --> 00:47:17,760
If I click on it, it does.

885
00:47:17,760 --> 00:47:27,400
It just has my driver's license info and I can pull it up and it has my picture, my address,

886
00:47:27,400 --> 00:47:28,400
my date of birth.

887
00:47:28,400 --> 00:47:29,720
Is that why you're in a bar?

888
00:47:29,720 --> 00:47:30,720
That's sick.

889
00:47:30,720 --> 00:47:34,640
I doubt it, but I could try it, I'm sure.

890
00:47:34,640 --> 00:47:35,640
It is official.

891
00:47:35,640 --> 00:47:36,640
It's insane.

892
00:47:36,640 --> 00:47:38,640
'Cause it like...

893
00:47:38,640 --> 00:47:40,640
Yeah.

894
00:47:40,640 --> 00:47:44,640
I didn't dox myself because it just literally has my name and my initial.

895
00:47:44,640 --> 00:47:46,640
Yeah, also we couldn't really see anything.

896
00:47:46,640 --> 00:47:51,640
Yeah, well I already know it all. So you did dox it to me.

897
00:47:51,640 --> 00:47:55,640
And it has my old address where I don't live anymore because I'm too lazy to update.

898
00:47:55,640 --> 00:47:57,640
Yeah, go ahead and send a bomb there man, I don't give a fuck.

899
00:47:57,640 --> 00:47:59,640
Yeah.

900
00:47:59,640 --> 00:48:01,640
I'm bad.

901
00:48:01,640 --> 00:48:03,640
I don't know.

902
00:48:03,640 --> 00:48:05,640
They did so much for you though.

903
00:48:05,640 --> 00:48:08,640
At what point of like...

904
00:48:08,640 --> 00:48:13,640
How big do you have to be for people to start wanting to SWAT you?

905
00:48:13,640 --> 00:48:15,640
Umm...

906
00:48:15,640 --> 00:48:18,640
Who's like the least known guy?

907
00:48:18,640 --> 00:48:21,640
Oh yeah, I guess you're right. You need to have an enemy.

908
00:48:21,640 --> 00:48:24,640
Yeah, you need to have someone preying on your downfall.

909
00:48:24,640 --> 00:48:27,640
That one like really famous story about like a kid who just like doxxed...

910
00:48:27,640 --> 00:48:31,640
Just like SWATed some other kid on COD and just like killed his neighbor.

911
00:48:31,640 --> 00:48:36,840
this name. But that's an enemy! Are you retarded? What is the difference between that and an

912
00:48:36,840 --> 00:48:42,520
enemy? An enemy? No, I'm gonna, I'm, I, we need to differentiate. An enemy is like a lifelong

913
00:48:42,520 --> 00:48:47,520
thing. Someone who will just do an evil thing to you. No, that's a nemesis! Yeah. You're

914
00:48:47,520 --> 00:48:55,200
a confusing enemy and nemesis, man. Yeah. I think it's a synop. There's many enemies.

915
00:48:55,200 --> 00:48:59,200
There's few nemeses in the side.

916
00:48:59,200 --> 00:49:00,200
I'm sorry.

917
00:49:00,200 --> 00:49:01,200
These are...

918
00:49:01,200 --> 00:49:02,200
They're...

919
00:49:02,200 --> 00:49:05,640
Well, they're not very around very much.

920
00:49:05,640 --> 00:49:07,320
They're rare, some might say.

921
00:49:07,320 --> 00:49:08,320
Yeah.

922
00:49:08,320 --> 00:49:09,880
You don't have one often.

923
00:49:09,880 --> 00:49:13,200
Like, you are often my enemy.

924
00:49:13,200 --> 00:49:14,880
But you are not my nemesis.

925
00:49:14,880 --> 00:49:15,880
Yeah.

926
00:49:15,880 --> 00:49:19,680
Do you have many enemies?

927
00:49:19,680 --> 00:49:20,680
I try not to, man.

928
00:49:20,680 --> 00:49:21,680
I don't think so.

929
00:49:21,680 --> 00:49:24,020
I try to live a very peaceful life.

930
00:49:24,020 --> 00:49:25,120
Try not to be rude to people.

931
00:49:25,120 --> 00:49:26,120
I try to be courteous.

932
00:49:26,120 --> 00:49:27,120
I try to be nice.

933
00:49:27,120 --> 00:49:28,120
I try to be...

934
00:49:28,120 --> 00:49:31,480
I try to be sexually forward with every single person I meet.

935
00:49:31,480 --> 00:49:37,920
I think the number one easiest way to get enemies is to just go out and drive around.

936
00:49:37,920 --> 00:49:38,920
I agree man.

937
00:49:38,920 --> 00:49:40,200
That is true.

938
00:49:40,200 --> 00:49:43,000
Nobody makes more enemies than a guy in a car.

939
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:44,120
That is true.

940
00:49:44,120 --> 00:49:45,120
Very temporary.

941
00:49:45,120 --> 00:49:47,720
Even I do it man.

942
00:49:47,720 --> 00:49:52,960
Listen, I jaywalk in front of cars daring them to hit me every single day.

943
00:49:52,960 --> 00:49:54,240
Like every single day.

944
00:49:54,240 --> 00:49:56,240
With a dog, mind you.

945
00:49:56,240 --> 00:49:59,120
with a dog that can easily be killed by a car.

946
00:49:59,120 --> 00:50:01,480
Me, I'm not so sure, we haven't tested it.

947
00:50:01,480 --> 00:50:03,840
But dogs provably can be killed by cars.

948
00:50:03,840 --> 00:50:07,360
And I walk right in front of them, they have the right of way, they have a green light.

949
00:50:07,360 --> 00:50:09,700
And I just go, fuck it, do something about it, right?

950
00:50:09,700 --> 00:50:15,360
But when I'm in a car and I'm driving and somebody puts their foot into the crosswalk,

951
00:50:15,360 --> 00:50:21,440
I lay on the horn, I will open my window, give them the finger, spit.

952
00:50:21,440 --> 00:50:22,520
Fuck you, man.

953
00:50:22,520 --> 00:50:27,360
There's something about driving a car that because you're driving a gun, yeah, like you're

954
00:50:27,360 --> 00:50:35,000
driving a weapon all the time at high velocities that you feel untouchable.

955
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:39,820
Also everybody thinks that their windows are bulletproof.

956
00:50:39,820 --> 00:50:42,440
Everybody thinks that every problem that you have when you're in a car and somebody else

957
00:50:42,440 --> 00:50:44,900
isn't can be solved by rolling up a window.

958
00:50:44,900 --> 00:50:48,200
Like I am fully convinced of that when I'm driving.

959
00:50:48,200 --> 00:50:52,640
That's true, I mean no one carries a gun.

960
00:50:52,640 --> 00:50:53,860
That's what I'm saying man.

961
00:50:53,860 --> 00:50:58,060
This is America, no one has a gun on them.

962
00:50:58,060 --> 00:51:01,020
No dude, and also I could see it from a mile away.

963
00:51:01,020 --> 00:51:09,260
A fat old guy who has something, who is wearing like a hoodie, not fucking with it.

964
00:51:09,260 --> 00:51:10,820
No no no, that guy might have a gun.

965
00:51:10,820 --> 00:51:11,820
Yeah that is true.

966
00:51:11,820 --> 00:51:13,540
Fat old guy with a hoodie, might have a gun.

967
00:51:13,540 --> 00:51:36,460
or

968
00:51:36,460 --> 00:51:37,660
to do fucking what, man?

969
00:51:37,660 --> 00:51:39,420
- You can probably find that on Amazon,

970
00:51:39,420 --> 00:51:42,980
for one of those made up Chinese brands for like $2.

971
00:51:42,980 --> 00:51:43,820
- But that's what I'm saying.

972
00:51:43,820 --> 00:51:45,140
It's like, that's not a,

973
00:51:45,140 --> 00:51:48,940
like you used to be able to go to the T-Mobile store

974
00:51:48,940 --> 00:51:51,540
and they would sell a holster for your phone.

975
00:51:51,540 --> 00:51:55,100
- Well, that was mainly during when Nexo was a thing, right?

976
00:51:55,100 --> 00:51:56,500
'Cause you have to get it out quickly

977
00:51:56,500 --> 00:51:58,160
'cause it's like a radio thing.

978
00:51:58,160 --> 00:52:01,340
- What?

979
00:52:01,340 --> 00:52:05,700
My grandpa had a fucking iPhone 2 in that thing.

980
00:52:05,700 --> 00:52:08,540
Yeah, I don't know what you're talking about with that.

981
00:52:08,540 --> 00:52:10,500
It was just a thing people did.

982
00:52:10,500 --> 00:52:12,180
I think it was predominantly--

983
00:52:12,180 --> 00:52:14,900
It's not like people are on their phone less.

984
00:52:14,900 --> 00:52:17,060
I saw my grandpa recently,

985
00:52:17,060 --> 00:52:20,980
and my grandma has a photo of my brother as her background,

986
00:52:20,980 --> 00:52:22,660
and has for like years.

987
00:52:22,660 --> 00:52:25,420
And he was like, "I wanna change my background.

988
00:52:25,420 --> 00:52:26,500
"How do I do that?"

989
00:52:26,500 --> 00:52:27,940
And I was like, "Oh, I'll change it."

990
00:52:27,940 --> 00:52:28,760
He's like, "You know what?

991
00:52:28,760 --> 00:52:30,520
"I want it to be a photo of you."

992
00:52:30,520 --> 00:52:32,220
And I was like, "Okay."

993
00:52:32,220 --> 00:52:34,540
So I took a selfie where I was like this.

994
00:52:34,540 --> 00:52:41,340
was like and I said it to be his background and he was like I don't like

995
00:52:41,340 --> 00:52:44,660
this photo I was like then fucking try to change it bitch

996
00:52:44,660 --> 00:52:50,340
you try go ahead and now he's gonna be like all my golf course just be like

997
00:52:50,340 --> 00:52:56,420
trying to show somebody a meme that he saw on a barstool Instagram page they'll

998
00:52:56,420 --> 00:53:06,460
like who's this gay guy it really was just tickling me and he got real mad

999
00:53:06,460 --> 00:53:09,680

1000
00:53:09,680 --> 00:53:21,780
is it angry ass New Jersey guy my sweet my sweet cute smile and he does it he

1001
00:53:21,780 --> 00:53:23,780
You can't change it, he has no idea how to change it.

1002
00:53:23,780 --> 00:53:25,780
Wait, did you do both screens?

1003
00:53:25,780 --> 00:53:26,780
Mm-hmm.

1004
00:53:26,780 --> 00:53:30,620
Yeah, and he had, oh, that was, he like looked at it, he was like, "Oh, okay," and then he

1005
00:53:30,620 --> 00:53:34,420
opened it and it was behind all of his apps, he's like, "God damn it, how the hell did

1006
00:53:34,420 --> 00:53:36,420
you even do that?"

1007
00:53:36,420 --> 00:53:39,420
That's great, man.

1008
00:53:39,420 --> 00:53:44,580
I've been laughing all day.

1009
00:53:44,580 --> 00:53:50,500
Have you been on the train and seen, there's like an ad for like a cyber security course,

1010
00:53:50,500 --> 00:53:55,300
And it's like my son/nephew's making 150k.

1011
00:53:55,300 --> 00:53:57,100
My son/nephew?

1012
00:53:57,100 --> 00:53:58,100
My son/nephew's.

1013
00:53:58,100 --> 00:53:59,100
Woah.

1014
00:53:59,100 --> 00:54:01,980
And I've been thinking just like all the different things.

1015
00:54:01,980 --> 00:54:05,820
Like my son/nephew knows how to change the background on my iPhone.

1016
00:54:05,820 --> 00:54:12,780
Just like, just like all the things people think their kids know how to do on the computer.

1017
00:54:12,780 --> 00:54:16,500
Dude, I hadn't hung out with him in a while.

1018
00:54:16,500 --> 00:54:20,020
He was just up here to visit a friend for his 80th birthday.

1019
00:54:20,020 --> 00:54:21,460
He's 81 years old.

1020
00:54:21,460 --> 00:54:22,580
My grandpa is.

1021
00:54:22,580 --> 00:54:23,580
He looks great.

1022
00:54:23,580 --> 00:54:25,420
He looks like he's in his 60s.

1023
00:54:25,420 --> 00:54:26,420
Shouts out.

1024
00:54:26,420 --> 00:54:28,100
Is he bald?

1025
00:54:28,100 --> 00:54:29,100
No.

1026
00:54:29,100 --> 00:54:30,180
Well, kinda.

1027
00:54:30,180 --> 00:54:31,700
He's got thin old guy hair.

1028
00:54:31,700 --> 00:54:33,700
But he has hair on his head.

1029
00:54:33,700 --> 00:54:34,700
Right.

1030
00:54:34,700 --> 00:54:35,700
Wispy.

1031
00:54:35,700 --> 00:54:38,660
But he was like, literally sat down before he said anything.

1032
00:54:38,660 --> 00:54:42,500
He was like, "So, you got a lot of Muslims in your neighborhood, huh?"

1033
00:54:42,500 --> 00:54:43,500
And I was like...

1034
00:54:43,500 --> 00:54:44,500
You sure do.

1035
00:54:44,500 --> 00:54:45,500
You sure do.

1036
00:54:45,500 --> 00:54:48,500
I was like, uh, I don't know, like maybe.

1037
00:54:48,500 --> 00:54:50,500
And he was like, oh, okay.

1038
00:54:50,500 --> 00:54:54,500
So, uh, have the riots been okay for you?

1039
00:54:54,500 --> 00:54:57,500
And I was like, what are you talking about?

1040
00:54:57,500 --> 00:55:02,500
And, uh, I realized, cause he said like, he was like, oh, I don't want to come into the city.

1041
00:55:02,500 --> 00:55:06,500
Come, will you come to New Jersey where I am and we'll get lunch?

1042
00:55:06,500 --> 00:55:07,500
And I was like, yeah, sure.

1043
00:55:07,500 --> 00:55:08,500
Not really even thinking about it.

1044
00:55:08,500 --> 00:55:12,500
But the reason he did was because he thought if he went into New York, he was going to get,

1045
00:55:12,500 --> 00:55:19,500
it

1046
00:55:19,500 --> 00:55:23,760
booked my trip from New York my my godfather I was talking I was like yeah

1047
00:55:23,760 --> 00:55:27,820
I got this got this plane tickets like whatever like oh yeah well you know I

1048
00:55:27,820 --> 00:55:31,180
was like yeah I'm staying with friends it's like it's gonna be real chill like

1049
00:55:31,180 --> 00:55:34,900
oh yeah that's great just uh be on the lookout for all the all the terrorist

1050
00:55:34,900 --> 00:55:41,500
attacks I was like what yeah be just just watch out be real careful like oh

1051
00:55:41,500 --> 00:55:46,820
yeah for sure no I told him no I'm friends with them bro don't worry which

1052
00:55:46,820 --> 00:55:49,420
which he didn't find really funny.

1053
00:55:49,420 --> 00:55:50,340
But he's just been like that.

1054
00:55:50,340 --> 00:55:53,420
When I went to Europe, he did the same thing.

1055
00:55:53,420 --> 00:55:55,080
He was like, "Be careful on the train stations.

1056
00:55:55,080 --> 00:55:56,980
"They're always blowing them up."

1057
00:55:56,980 --> 00:55:59,660
And I was like, "No, they don't."

1058
00:55:59,660 --> 00:56:03,060
- It's so awesome, dude, 'cause it's,

1059
00:56:03,060 --> 00:56:05,900
stop burping, man, that's disgusting.

1060
00:56:05,900 --> 00:56:06,740
- Okay, I'm sorry.

1061
00:56:06,740 --> 00:56:08,540
- It is basically the exact same thing

1062
00:56:08,540 --> 00:56:10,800
where you meet people in New York,

1063
00:56:10,800 --> 00:56:12,540
and they'll go, "Where are you from?"

1064
00:56:12,540 --> 00:56:13,920
And I say, "I'm from North Carolina."

1065
00:56:13,920 --> 00:56:15,660
They're always from fucking L.A.

1066
00:56:15,660 --> 00:56:17,900
and they go like, "Oh, North Carolina.

1067
00:56:17,900 --> 00:56:25,900
So is their Ku Klux Klan running around your house all the time?"

1068
00:56:25,900 --> 00:56:27,700
And I always do the same thing that I do with my grandpa.

1069
00:56:27,700 --> 00:56:28,700
I just go like, "Yeah, man.

1070
00:56:28,700 --> 00:56:29,700
It's crazy."

1071
00:56:29,700 --> 00:56:30,700
It's crazy.

1072
00:56:30,700 --> 00:56:31,700
It's crazy, dude.

1073
00:56:31,700 --> 00:56:32,700
One of them.

1074
00:56:32,700 --> 00:56:35,500
The Ku Klux Klan is running around all the time, dude.

1075
00:56:35,500 --> 00:56:36,500
It stinks.

1076
00:56:36,500 --> 00:56:40,540
I don't think I said this on the podcast, but there was a Palestine protest that went

1077
00:56:40,540 --> 00:56:43,860
by my place.

1078
00:56:43,860 --> 00:56:51,620
And I was really mad because it like woke me up, but then I realized it was like 11am.

1079
00:56:51,620 --> 00:56:54,620
You know, so I couldn't really be that mad about it.

1080
00:56:54,620 --> 00:56:55,620
Yeah.

1081
00:56:55,620 --> 00:57:00,740
You know, like, it woke me up, but I was like, I don't want to wake in my neighborhood.

1082
00:57:00,740 --> 00:57:01,740
I guess.

1083
00:57:01,740 --> 00:57:02,740
Yeah, that is true.

1084
00:57:02,740 --> 00:57:07,540
It woke me up to the evils of the Israeli people.

1085
00:57:07,540 --> 00:57:08,540
Yep.

1086
00:57:08,540 --> 00:57:09,540
Yep.

1087
00:57:09,540 --> 00:57:13,540
Can you protest at like 4 in the afternoon when I'm fully awake?

1088
00:57:13,540 --> 00:57:15,480
Yeah.

1089
00:57:15,480 --> 00:57:17,480
What are they doing in your neighborhood?

1090
00:57:17,480 --> 00:57:19,620
I don't fucking know, dude.

1091
00:57:19,620 --> 00:57:20,620
They're trying to get ya.

1092
00:57:20,620 --> 00:57:25,540
They knew that there was heebs in their neighborhood.

1093
00:57:25,540 --> 00:57:29,940
Yeah, do you mask up and hide your identity when you go outside now?

1094
00:57:29,940 --> 00:57:31,140
Uh, no.

1095
00:57:31,140 --> 00:57:33,140
No, I don't do that.

1096
00:57:33,140 --> 00:57:36,900
You should now that beers we drink is blown up and taking over the world.

1097
00:57:36,900 --> 00:57:37,860
That is true.

1098
00:57:38,340 --> 00:57:44,140
I am like one of the only white people in my neighborhood, but that is fine.

1099
00:57:44,140 --> 00:57:45,140
It's so obvious.

1100
00:57:45,140 --> 00:57:46,740
Oh, okay, it's fine, it's not good.

1101
00:57:46,740 --> 00:57:47,740
Interesting.

1102
00:57:47,740 --> 00:57:53,220
Well, it's fine because, you know, the homeless people will be like, "Oh, so you're not from

1103
00:57:53,220 --> 00:57:54,220
here."

1104
00:57:54,220 --> 00:57:56,180
I think it's good.

1105
00:57:56,180 --> 00:57:57,660
It's fine to be white.

1106
00:57:57,660 --> 00:57:58,860
I want to be...

1107
00:57:58,860 --> 00:58:01,340
No, I didn't say that.

1108
00:58:01,340 --> 00:58:07,360
It's wrong to be white, and I want to live in a neighborhood where I'm the only white

1109
00:58:07,360 --> 00:58:11,800
person and I walk around and people are giving me swirlies and throwing me into lockers and

1110
00:58:11,800 --> 00:58:14,600
stuff that's what I think that I deserve.

1111
00:58:14,600 --> 00:58:16,800
But that's not what happens in his life.

1112
00:58:16,800 --> 00:58:18,840
Every time he goes outside he has an adventure.

1113
00:58:18,840 --> 00:58:20,720
He meets like good characters.

1114
00:58:20,720 --> 00:58:21,720
That is true.

1115
00:58:21,720 --> 00:58:22,960
There's always characters.

1116
00:58:22,960 --> 00:58:27,760
I walked by a door and I was like oh that's the last time I interacted with Aki.

1117
00:58:27,760 --> 00:58:32,040
He was sitting outside this door and then like as I had that thought the door opened and he

1118
00:58:32,040 --> 00:58:33,040
walked out.

1119
00:58:33,040 --> 00:58:34,040
Damn.

1120
00:58:34,040 --> 00:58:36,040
You doxxed Aki?

1121
00:58:36,040 --> 00:58:39,400
In my mind.

1122
00:58:39,400 --> 00:58:41,400
Did he, wait, did he actually hook it up this time?

1123
00:58:41,400 --> 00:58:44,800
No, he still thinks that he gave me free weed, dude.

1124
00:58:44,800 --> 00:58:48,760
He thinks that he gave me free weed and then I like

1125
00:58:48,760 --> 00:58:51,360
welfed on him, you know?

1126
00:58:51,360 --> 00:58:53,360
Do you confront him about it? Like you didn't actually do that?

1127
00:58:53,360 --> 00:58:58,080
I texted him that like the day of but he still was like...

1128
00:58:58,080 --> 00:59:00,080
I forgot about that.

1129
00:59:00,080 --> 00:59:02,080
I forgot you met a guy named Aki.

1130
00:59:02,080 --> 00:59:05,640
And him memes yeah, I should enable request right now

1131
00:59:05,640 --> 00:59:20,920
I should do that. We'll do that one night. We'll do that one night at like 1 a.m. We'll send him like

1132
00:59:20,920 --> 00:59:28,200
If we win we have to be like now you owe me a free

1133
00:59:28,880 --> 00:59:33,280
I haven't gotten a scamming text message in a while.

1134
00:59:33,280 --> 00:59:37,520
I haven't either but I still get the phone calls all the time.

1135
00:59:37,520 --> 00:59:42,880
I ignore, I have not answered the phone in so fucking long.

1136
00:59:42,880 --> 00:59:47,960
If it's not, if it's not my wife calling me, I do not answer the phone.

1137
00:59:47,960 --> 00:59:56,880
Well, I try to do that also, but the thing is I have to get calls and pick them up when like shit's getting like delivered.

1138
00:59:56,880 --> 00:59:58,880
And I get stuffed in the room all the time.

1139
00:59:58,880 --> 01:00:01,880
Because I don't have like a door, like a doorbell or anything.

1140
01:00:01,880 --> 01:00:02,880
You have a door.

1141
01:00:02,880 --> 01:00:03,880
I don't have a door.

1142
01:00:03,880 --> 01:00:09,880
Well, do you still live in like, the area code you got your phone in?

1143
01:00:09,880 --> 01:00:11,880
No.

1144
01:00:11,880 --> 01:00:16,880
Cause for me it's like really obvious when I'm getting a scan because it's-

1145
01:00:16,880 --> 01:00:18,880
Cause it has the old area code.

1146
01:00:18,880 --> 01:00:21,880
Yeah. It's like no one from Phoenix should be calling me.

1147
01:00:21,880 --> 01:00:22,880
Yeah.

1148
01:00:22,880 --> 01:00:24,240
There's no reason for that.

1149
01:00:24,240 --> 01:00:28,600
There's no one that could possibly be calling me from Phoenix that I don't have in my phone

1150
01:00:28,600 --> 01:00:29,600
already.

1151
01:00:29,600 --> 01:00:31,760
I just wait for the, just leave me a voicemail dude.

1152
01:00:31,760 --> 01:00:37,840
You get to leave me an awesome voice message that I can't, uh, don't know how to change.

1153
01:00:37,840 --> 01:00:42,720
Where I, it's like, yeah, now leave your message for Caleb Pitts.

1154
01:00:42,720 --> 01:00:45,320
That's exactly how I say it.

1155
01:00:45,320 --> 01:00:46,320
Caleb Pitts.

1156
01:00:46,320 --> 01:00:49,720
Cause I was like 15 and I wanted to sound like an adult.

1157
01:00:49,720 --> 01:00:50,720
Right.

1158
01:00:50,720 --> 01:00:51,720
Caleb Pitts.

1159
01:00:51,720 --> 01:00:52,720
Caleb Pitts.

1160
01:00:52,720 --> 01:00:53,720
What's up?

1161
01:00:53,720 --> 01:00:54,720
Leave your message where?

1162
01:00:54,720 --> 01:00:55,720
What's up?

1163
01:00:55,720 --> 01:00:56,720
What's up?

1164
01:00:56,720 --> 01:00:57,720
Leave your message where?

1165
01:00:57,720 --> 01:00:58,720
What up man?

1166
01:00:58,720 --> 01:01:04,440
Now the way they try to scam me is through WhatsApp.

1167
01:01:04,440 --> 01:01:10,040
They do like a weird WhatsApp message and I already know that it's a scam so usually

1168
01:01:10,040 --> 01:01:16,360
I just send them a picture and last time I sent them a picture of the face to have fat

1169
01:01:16,360 --> 01:01:21,540
kale picture and I thought it was really funny and so I posted that interaction in my story

1170
01:01:21,540 --> 01:01:28,500
on Instagram. But it was a mistake because Kelo's brother follows me on Instagram. So

1171
01:01:28,500 --> 01:01:32,460
I saw it and I was like, "Oh, is that Kelo?" I was like, "Yeah, man." I just sent him the

1172
01:01:32,460 --> 01:01:37,020
picture without thinking. And then he says like, "Thank you. I'm going to treasure this

1173
01:01:37,020 --> 01:01:41,140
for my entire life." I was like, "Maybe I shouldn't have done that. Maybe I should have

1174
01:01:41,140 --> 01:01:42,140
consulted Kelo first."

1175
01:01:42,140 --> 01:01:46,740
You're ruining your friend's life, dude. My brother is a known pranker.

1176
01:01:46,740 --> 01:01:50,460
I realized that a little too late. So I was like, "Ah, well."

1177
01:01:50,460 --> 01:01:55,460
Jubio loves to hold on to face-apped photos of people.

1178
01:01:55,460 --> 01:01:58,540
- He likes having incriminating information

1179
01:01:58,540 --> 01:01:59,940
on every single one of his friends.

1180
01:01:59,940 --> 01:02:01,500
- Well, he just thinks it's so funny

1181
01:02:01,500 --> 01:02:03,900
when they're face-apped and they look funny.

1182
01:02:03,900 --> 01:02:06,340
- I think it's funny when I open the face-apped app

1183
01:02:06,340 --> 01:02:08,100
and I do one of my selfies,

1184
01:02:08,100 --> 01:02:10,020
and I just do the one where it takes off my glasses

1185
01:02:10,020 --> 01:02:10,960
and I look insane.

1186
01:02:10,960 --> 01:02:13,780
That's what I think is funny.

1187
01:02:13,780 --> 01:02:15,140
- Okay.

1188
01:02:15,140 --> 01:02:16,780
- But the fat killer.

1189
01:02:16,780 --> 01:02:18,860
- But you did that to everyone else too.

1190
01:02:18,860 --> 01:02:22,360
I had a... I talked to my friend Gus last night.

1191
01:02:22,360 --> 01:02:24,860
You're obsessed with me? You're obsessed with Kaler?

1192
01:02:24,860 --> 01:02:25,860
That's not true.

1193
01:02:25,860 --> 01:02:33,860
I talked to my buddy Gus last night, who by the way, I'm doing a show with him in Los Angeles next week, next Friday.

1194
01:02:33,860 --> 01:02:38,860
He will link it, come out to that. But I asked him, and I want to ask you guys this question.

1195
01:02:38,860 --> 01:02:43,860
How much money would, like, a group of your ten closest friends say,

1196
01:02:43,860 --> 01:02:47,860
"Hey man, we want to give you $10,000," or whatever amount of money.

1197
01:02:47,860 --> 01:02:53,860
But we have to go through, we have to be able to go through every note you've ever made on your phone.

1198
01:02:53,860 --> 01:02:57,620
How much money would it cost?

1199
01:02:57,620 --> 01:03:00,420
I don't really take notes on my phone.

1200
01:03:00,420 --> 01:03:03,340
I take a lot of notes on my phone, but

1201
01:03:03,340 --> 01:03:07,140
what they are, they're like show notes for the podcast.

1202
01:03:07,140 --> 01:03:10,100
So it's just, it would just be like

1203
01:03:10,100 --> 01:03:16,140
episode like two whatever on the title of the podcast and then like 16 minutes in

1204
01:03:17,140 --> 01:03:19,380
pervert spa like 18 minutes in

1205
01:03:19,380 --> 01:03:25,020
Just another look terrible of a bit. So that's what my notes up looks like mine are

1206
01:03:25,020 --> 01:03:30,300
Literally, I have thousands of notes of things that I wrote down when I was smoking weed

1207
01:03:30,300 --> 01:03:33,380
That are complete nonsense

1208
01:03:33,380 --> 01:03:38,080
Like this one I read to him last night and this is just this is one of the only ones that I think is

1209
01:03:38,080 --> 01:03:40,200
I'm willing to read

1210
01:03:40,200 --> 01:03:44,460
Imagine trying toilet water and realizing dogs are right

1211
01:03:46,340 --> 01:03:51,120
My entire I'm not kidding all of my notes are stuff like this

1212
01:03:51,120 --> 01:03:56,860
Can I go it's fucking awful man, no man, please

1213
01:03:56,860 --> 01:04:05,060
It's like almost a joke but most of this is a what this is one is recipes

1214
01:04:05,060 --> 01:04:07,900
These are the recipes that I came up with on

1215
01:04:07,900 --> 01:04:12,700
February 10th my am I me and my wife's anniversary

1216
01:04:14,460 --> 01:04:16,980
I wrote this down.

1217
01:04:16,980 --> 01:04:21,820
Pickle butter popcorn and miso kombucha.

1218
01:04:21,820 --> 01:04:26,820
These were the things I was like, this is a flavor combination that nobody's ever thought

1219
01:04:26,820 --> 01:04:27,820
of.

1220
01:04:27,820 --> 01:04:28,820
Wow.

1221
01:04:28,820 --> 01:04:29,820
That's fire.

1222
01:04:29,820 --> 01:04:35,740
Let's trade notes up next time we see each other.

1223
01:04:35,740 --> 01:04:37,700
Oh, this was for the tour.

1224
01:04:37,700 --> 01:04:40,900
I was going to hire Shadow Hayes.

1225
01:04:40,900 --> 01:04:47,900
You know the guy who does the DJ drops to say, "DJ Poop, wait, what's that smell?"

1226
01:04:47,900 --> 01:04:48,900
I remember that.

1227
01:04:48,900 --> 01:04:49,900
Yeah, I remember that.

1228
01:04:49,900 --> 01:04:52,900
We had a fun time with DJ Rick and Morty.

1229
01:04:52,900 --> 01:05:00,420
DJ Rick and Morty, he a badass motherfucker who don't take shit from nobody.

1230
01:05:00,420 --> 01:05:02,060
That guy has a stanky ass.

1231
01:05:02,060 --> 01:05:04,540
Those were the three things that I wrote down.

1232
01:05:04,540 --> 01:05:09,540
And then DJ Poop, wait, what's that smell?

1233
01:05:09,540 --> 01:05:15,740
Yeah, that's, I mean it's all just awful stuff like this, man.

1234
01:05:15,740 --> 01:05:18,020
That's not awful, that's not even embarrassing.

1235
01:05:18,020 --> 01:05:20,100
No, but a lot of them are embarrassing.

1236
01:05:20,100 --> 01:05:22,420
I have some that are ideas for short stories.

1237
01:05:22,420 --> 01:05:24,020
Okay, like what?

1238
01:05:24,020 --> 01:05:27,420
I won't tell you, man.

1239
01:05:27,420 --> 01:05:28,900
I won't tell you.

1240
01:05:28,900 --> 01:05:33,020
Would you rather have one million dollars or fuck your brother?

1241
01:05:33,020 --> 01:05:36,940
I'm not going...

1242
01:05:36,940 --> 01:05:38,940
I'm not going...

1243
01:05:38,940 --> 01:05:47,180
It's just a note that said, "Would you rather have one million dollars or fuck your brother?"

1244
01:05:47,180 --> 01:05:49,220
I'm telling you, this is not...

1245
01:05:49,220 --> 01:05:50,220
I would not...

1246
01:05:50,220 --> 01:05:51,220
There's no way.

1247
01:05:51,220 --> 01:05:52,220
I'm not reading any more of these.

1248
01:05:52,220 --> 01:05:53,220
These are wrong.

1249
01:05:53,220 --> 01:05:54,220
That's powerful.

1250
01:05:54,220 --> 01:05:55,220
That's a powerful thought.

1251
01:05:55,220 --> 01:05:57,100
Yeah, I don't know about that.

1252
01:05:57,100 --> 01:05:59,620
What are you having in your notes, Rex?

1253
01:05:59,620 --> 01:06:05,820
I have an idea for a scam and then just a blank note that says, "An app a day."

1254
01:06:05,820 --> 01:06:09,820
*laughter*

1255
01:06:09,820 --> 01:06:11,820
Wow!

1256
01:06:11,820 --> 01:06:13,820
Yeah, you finish the rest of that, man.

1257
01:06:13,820 --> 01:06:15,820
*laughter*

1258
01:06:15,820 --> 01:06:17,820
That's a...

1259
01:06:17,820 --> 01:06:19,820
*unintelligible*

1260
01:06:19,820 --> 01:06:21,820
*laughter*

1261
01:06:21,820 --> 01:06:23,820
An apple a day.

1262
01:06:23,820 --> 01:06:25,820
I think there was something there.

1263
01:06:25,820 --> 01:06:27,820
*laughter*

1264
01:06:27,820 --> 01:06:29,820
Wait, what's the scam?

1265
01:06:29,820 --> 01:06:31,820
Do we know about it?

1266
01:06:31,820 --> 01:06:33,820
He can't give it away, man.

1267
01:06:33,820 --> 01:06:35,820
It's not really a spam, but it's...

1268
01:06:35,820 --> 01:06:38,320
No.

1269
01:06:38,320 --> 01:06:41,820
It's like one of Caleb's things where it just makes no sense.

1270
01:06:41,820 --> 01:06:49,820
That's like a Pinterest idea, like, "Pickle, enjoy your popcorn."

1271
01:06:49,820 --> 01:06:55,820
Thank you so much, I love you guys. This is seriously gopher vibes today.

1272
01:06:55,820 --> 01:06:58,820
The way that I went through these peanuts.

1273
01:06:58,820 --> 01:07:02,820
That's what these are now. These are peanuts. I'm a gopher.

1274
01:07:02,820 --> 01:07:06,820
Thank you for tuning in.

1275
01:07:06,820 --> 01:07:09,820
Sofer no vofer.

1276
01:07:09,820 --> 01:07:12,820
I love you all.

1277
01:07:12,820 --> 01:07:16,820
Bye.
