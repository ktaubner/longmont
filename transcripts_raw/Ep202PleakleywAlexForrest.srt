12
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:38,720
because that was a real problem I had before. Yeah. And you changed your name to, well you

13
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:45,400
stopped drinking when you converted to Islam. Yep. No, my name's always, no. No. I thought

14
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:49,640
you were doing a thing where it's like Caleb comes back from vacation and he's. Oh, okay.

15
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:54,080
I am doing that. Yeah. Caleb's still on vacation, he's never coming back. Like you did like

16
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:55,420
- I was on vacation.

17
00:00:55,420 --> 00:00:57,260
- Yeah, I was too.

18
00:00:57,260 --> 00:00:58,100
- It's pretty nice.

19
00:00:58,100 --> 00:00:59,160
- We all took vacations.

20
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:00,300
- We did all take vacations.

21
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:01,840
I was on the beach.

22
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:02,680
- I went to the beautiful Bay Area.

23
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:03,520
- Soaking up the rays.

24
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:07,380
I was in the beautiful outer banks of North Carolina.

25
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:09,180
- You didn't tell me where you were going.

26
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:10,680
- I didn't want anyone to show up.

27
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:11,520
- It's a secret.

28
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:12,340
- You have to keep it secret.

29
00:01:12,340 --> 00:01:13,180
- You didn't tell me where you were going

30
00:01:13,180 --> 00:01:15,020
until you got back.

31
00:01:15,020 --> 00:01:17,140
- It's a safety thing.

32
00:01:17,140 --> 00:01:19,100
- The whole time I was like,

33
00:01:19,100 --> 00:01:20,480
"Okay, I'm just at the beach."

34
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:21,320
(laughing)

35
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:22,160
- I'm just at the beach.

36
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:22,980
- I'm just at the beach.

37
00:01:22,980 --> 00:01:29,560
I am just at the beach. I was at the beach. I was soaking up the water.

38
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:32,160
Oh yeah? Just soaking it up.

39
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:33,160
Soaking it up like a baby.

40
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:34,160
What I saw was a baby.

41
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:37,360
You're just drinking the water in the sea salt.

42
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:39,000
Oh my God, I saw dolphins.

43
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:45,760
I think I would have, if I knew where he was going, maybe I had been there before and I

44
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:48,600
could give him recommendations.

45
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:49,600
But no.

46
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:51,600
Check out the beach. Try the water.

47
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:56,960
try to the beach, try the water, you gotta try the sand, you gotta bury your head in

48
00:01:56,960 --> 00:02:01,360
the sand, you gotta bury yourself neck up, I was boogie boarding, yeah, that's cool,

49
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:06,400
like Kenny Powers, yeah, I just watched that episode, I got a rash on my belly from boogie

50
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:11,120
boarding, that's why you gotta wear the shirt, yeah the rash guard, I got sun poisoning,

51
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:16,960
you got sun poisoning, yeah, when I was in Oakland, what does that mean, you got overheated,

52
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:21,680
I know I you were in like a doctor octopus kind of like experiment gone

53
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:22,520
wrong.

54
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:28,160
I was poisoned by I, um, I,

55
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:32,480
I went skating for like, I don't know, I think it was like three hours.

56
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:35,520
And I was like, damn, like the weather here is like so good.

57
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:39,480
Like this literally feels like springtime and like,

58
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:42,680
cause it was like 65 degrees out. And, uh,

59
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:48,900
I thought because like, you know, like you don't have to wear as much sunblock in the

60
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:49,900
spring, you know.

61
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:50,900
It's like the sun.

62
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:53,860
Well, I think it's the thing where that's the opposite, where you think you don't, but

63
00:02:53,860 --> 00:02:56,060
everyone's like, "Well, actually, you know, you actually do."

64
00:02:56,060 --> 00:02:57,540
The sun's always beating down.

65
00:02:57,540 --> 00:02:58,540
But you don't.

66
00:02:58,540 --> 00:02:59,540
The sun's always there.

67
00:02:59,540 --> 00:03:00,540
Right.

68
00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:03,220
Well, I, you know, for no, I didn't put on any sunblock.

69
00:03:03,220 --> 00:03:06,020
You're supposed to wear sunblock year round, even at night.

70
00:03:06,020 --> 00:03:07,020
Do you do that?

71
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:08,020
No.

72
00:03:08,020 --> 00:03:09,020
Okay.

73
00:03:09,020 --> 00:03:10,020
At night?

74
00:03:10,020 --> 00:03:11,020
Yeah.

75
00:03:11,020 --> 00:03:12,020
You are supposed to wear it at night.

76
00:03:12,020 --> 00:03:14,020
Really?

77
00:03:14,020 --> 00:03:20,020
I don't know, my girlfriend's always telling me I wear sunscreen probably like two days out of the year.

78
00:03:20,020 --> 00:03:24,180
Yeah, my face. Y'all are pretty pale. Look at how red, look at, you can see.

79
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:26,900
Well, this was red before.

80
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:33,060
Okay, all right, wait. The inside of my mouth got so sunburned. Cut your hand open, look how red.

81
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:37,220
Oh my god.

82
00:03:37,220 --> 00:03:42,180
Yeah, but the Oakland, Oakland, California, beautiful, one of the most beautiful places

83
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:48,500
in the world. Yeah, I think the Bay Area, I think people give too much shit to the Bay Area because

84
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:55,860
of the tech stuff, but San Francisco is a beautiful place. What do you got? You got the Golden Gate,

85
00:03:55,860 --> 00:04:03,700
you got Pixar. Chiopino. You got Chiopino. It's got beautiful, it's built on a beautiful mountain.

86
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:06,580
on one side and down the other.

87
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:09,340
- That is the best food I've ever eaten.

88
00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:11,900
- Is that that red thing that you were talking about?

89
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:14,660
- That seafood stew, I'm rubbing my belly just thinking

90
00:04:14,660 --> 00:04:15,500
about it. - You probably told me

91
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:16,700
about this like five times.

92
00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:18,420
- Yeah, dude. - How much you like that.

93
00:04:18,420 --> 00:04:20,780
- Oh my God, it's the best thing I've ever had.

94
00:04:20,780 --> 00:04:21,700
- What is it again?

95
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:23,740
I forgot. - It's just like a,

96
00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:26,020
it's like a fisherman's stew.

97
00:04:26,020 --> 00:04:27,340
- I had donuts.

98
00:04:27,340 --> 00:04:29,380
(laughing)

99
00:04:29,380 --> 00:04:30,820
At the beach.

100
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:31,660
- Hell yeah.

101
00:04:31,660 --> 00:04:34,500
- Thank you, Pino, for my birthday.

102
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:35,920
- Maple bacon.

103
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:38,160
(laughing)

104
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:41,160
- 25 now.

105
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:42,000
- Wow.

106
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:42,820
- Do you feel--

107
00:04:42,820 --> 00:04:43,660
- One more year on my parents' health insurance.

108
00:04:43,660 --> 00:04:45,780
- You're a quarter of the way to being a wizard.

109
00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:46,620
- Yeah?

110
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:47,460
- Ooh.

111
00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:48,280
- Yeah.

112
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:50,340
- If you hit 100 and you're alive, you get to be a wizard.

113
00:04:50,340 --> 00:04:51,180
That's how it works.

114
00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:52,020
- That's pretty cool.

115
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:54,740
- Yeah, there's some people trying to circumvent that.

116
00:04:54,740 --> 00:04:56,700
Some people calling themselves wizards.

117
00:04:56,700 --> 00:04:58,180
They wear big, white, pointy hats.

118
00:04:58,180 --> 00:04:59,800
Now, here's what I say to all you wizards.

119
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:00,640
Fuck you.

120
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:01,460
- Fuck you.

121
00:05:01,460 --> 00:05:03,340
That's right, we don't like you.

122
00:05:03,340 --> 00:05:04,660
And you're not even real wizards.

123
00:05:04,660 --> 00:05:05,660
I hate those people.

124
00:05:05,660 --> 00:05:06,660
You're actually racist.

125
00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:09,780
Although, there are 24 year olds who wear the hat.

126
00:05:09,780 --> 00:05:11,580
It's like, "Nope, not yet buddy.

127
00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:13,420
One more year.

128
00:05:13,420 --> 00:05:14,420
Take the hat off."

129
00:05:14,420 --> 00:05:17,500
Have you seen, speaking of, have you seen that video of Ezra Miller?

130
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:18,500
Yes.

131
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:20,660
And they're in a car.

132
00:05:20,660 --> 00:05:22,660
Whatever it is, yes.

133
00:05:22,660 --> 00:05:29,740
They're in their car and they're calling out a specific chapter of the KKK.

134
00:05:29,740 --> 00:05:34,120
they're saying like you should all kill yourselves okay or I'm gonna do it for

135
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:37,280
you Wow that's good okay they redeem themselves

136
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:43,900
specific chapter is very funny you should not know the chapter of the KKK

137
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:51,740
that's a huge red flag like why do they know the fucking- you gotta do your research before that's true

138
00:05:51,740 --> 00:05:54,980
because well yeah cuz that chapter they were that chapter they were saying they

139
00:05:54,980 --> 00:05:57,620
were gonna kill it those are bad guys but some other chapters they're not so

140
00:05:57,620 --> 00:06:01,320
bad. It's a bad apples in the video. They said, you know what

141
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:05,880
you're doing, which means like you're not either have personal

142
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:09,000
beef. Yeah, or yeah, you know what you know what you're doing.

143
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,400
You're not giving you're not giving the time of day to entry

144
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:13,800
interviews. You're not reading the applications that people

145
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:19,320
send in. Yeah. You're denying people for no reason. compliment

146
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:20,720
You just flat out ignore them.

147
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:26,640
Yeah, dude.

148
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:27,600
That's cool.

149
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:28,880
Is that a recent video?

150
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:30,200
No, it's from a while ago.

151
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:32,280
Oh, it's from the 1800s.

152
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:35,200
Was that one that you sent me?

153
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:35,920
It's the one of them.

154
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:37,980
They're like on in the middle of an interview.

155
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:40,520
They just start singing like Michael Rowe.

156
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:46,120
Oh, yeah, that's on that movie phone with that movie critic.

157
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:46,520
I can't wait.

158
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:48,840
Did that one come out a long time ago?

159
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:50,560
That was like right when they got famous.

160
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:51,720
Like I think they were promoting

161
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:53,480
Perks of Being a Wallflower.

162
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:56,160
- Holy shit, so they've just been psychotic forever.

163
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:58,440
- One was, what about, they were in

164
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:00,560
We Need to Talk About Kevin too, right?

165
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:02,320
Was that before or after that?

166
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:03,880
Before Perks of Being a Wallflower?

167
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:05,720
- That was probably after.

168
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:06,960
- That was before?

169
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:07,800
I don't know.

170
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:10,440
I'm just, if that was like their first big movie,

171
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:11,440
that'd be pretty funny.

172
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:12,280
- Yeah.

173
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:13,120
- That that just eventually--

174
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:14,760
- I think that was.

175
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:15,840
- Yeah, I don't know.

176
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:17,080
- I know him from Perks.

177
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:18,120
(laughing)

178
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:21,600
I know him from Perks. I'll tell you I love that movie. That's a great movie.

179
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:22,600
Perks of being a wallflower?

180
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:23,600
I love that movie.

181
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:27,600
I'm outing myself as a...

182
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:34,880
Yeah, I prefer the intellectual version, Perks of Being on the Mayflower. It's a historical

183
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:39,080
drama. Also starring Ezra Miller.

184
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:41,920
There is no Perks of Being on the Mayflower though.

185
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:46,520
Perks of Being on the... Perks of Being a Wallflower is interesting though because that

186
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:50,680
movie I think was like written and directed by the guy who wrote the book

187
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:54,760
that's always interesting the the exorcist 3 is like the same way

188
00:07:54,760 --> 00:08:01,520
exorcist 3 is so sick it's always so good yeah yeah what's it William Peter

189
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:06,520

244
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:39,580

00:11:41,260 --> 00:11:48,220
Dr. Jacques von hamster veal his lab partner. Oh, I remember Jacques von hamster veal. That

247
00:11:48,220 --> 00:11:53,260
sounds like a deep cut reference to the show. If I was like the main villain of the show.

248
00:11:53,260 --> 00:11:59,020
Oh, I guess. Is that the other? Is that Ruben's boss? Yeah. Oh, okay. I didn't know his name.

249
00:11:59,020 --> 00:12:03,300

250
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:10,620

251
00:12:10,620 --> 00:12:14,460
that one lady that like the skinny and hamster veal seems to have a bit of a

252
00:12:14,460 --> 00:12:18,500
Napoleon complex what does hamster will look like he looks like a hamster yeah

253
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:25,860
oh yeah speaking of speaking of Trump we saw the birds last night and the guy in

254
00:12:25,860 --> 00:12:30,220
the movie sounded like Trump yeah the main guy sounded like you're doing an

255
00:12:30,220 --> 00:12:34,100
impression of Donald Trump yeah it was really funny so if you ever if you're

256
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:38,420
listening you ever end up watching the birds imagine that guy's is Trump yeah

257
00:12:38,420 --> 00:12:41,740
when he says your eyes birds they flew down the chimney it was like I don't

258
00:12:41,740 --> 00:12:44,860
know what happened I was like for like five minutes I was just like like as

259
00:12:44,860 --> 00:12:48,460
soon as you said like he sounded like Trump when he did that one like line

260
00:12:48,460 --> 00:12:53,220
delivery I was like oh he kind of does then for five minutes I just like wasn't

261
00:12:53,220 --> 00:12:58,900
looking at the screen I was listening to him like yo that does sound stupid easy

262
00:12:58,900 --> 00:13:03,500
to do though cuz the birds very boring movie I thought I fell asleep yeah you

263
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:06,860
You were like nodding off. You were like a cartoon.

264
00:13:06,860 --> 00:13:11,260
It was so funny. I was really hoping that you'd start snoring.

265
00:13:11,260 --> 00:13:15,860
I did. I did start snoring, but like it was like that thing, like I was, cause I was like

266
00:13:15,860 --> 00:13:21,940
sitting, I was able to catch myself. I went like, and like, yeah, you like shot up and

267
00:13:21,940 --> 00:13:27,140
you were like, boring.

268
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:28,980
We saw the birds in theater.

269
00:13:28,980 --> 00:13:29,980
Yeah.

270
00:13:29,980 --> 00:13:31,140
Dude, that fucking...

271
00:13:31,140 --> 00:13:33,580
I don't give a fuck about the first half of that movie.

272
00:13:33,580 --> 00:13:35,260
I liked all the parts with the birds in it.

273
00:13:35,260 --> 00:13:36,660
Maybe that's what...

274
00:13:36,660 --> 00:13:39,460
'Cause like you were saying, like, there's like...

275
00:13:39,460 --> 00:13:43,380
Like there's like, oh, you're supposed to put yourself in the shoes of the birds.

276
00:13:43,380 --> 00:13:44,980
Maybe they put that like...

277
00:13:44,980 --> 00:13:47,180
In the claws of the birds.

278
00:13:47,180 --> 00:13:48,140
In the talons of the birds.

279
00:13:48,140 --> 00:13:49,380
In the feathers of the birds.

280
00:13:49,380 --> 00:13:50,340
From a bird's eye view.

281
00:13:50,340 --> 00:13:51,620
From a bird's eye view.

282
00:13:51,620 --> 00:13:52,100
Yeah.

283
00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:54,620
You're supposed to watch that movie from a bird's eye view.

284
00:13:54,740 --> 00:14:00,220
It would be the first half of the movie is boring because you're like man. I fucking hate all these people

285
00:14:00,220 --> 00:14:04,320
Yeah, I never want to see these people and I'm just a bird and I'm a friend

286
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:07,940
Yeah, that's why there's I don't even it's I need a worm right now

287
00:14:07,940 --> 00:14:11,620
I don't know how how they like marketed it when it came out or whatever

288
00:14:11,620 --> 00:14:17,060
But it'd be crazy to like if you're like in like when it like 1963 or whenever it came out. It was 63, right?

289
00:14:17,060 --> 00:14:22,040
Yeah, it was 63 like going to the theater and being like, oh, it's like a new Alfred Hitchcock movie

290
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:26,600
It's called the birds and it opens up and it's about like oh this woman like bringing birds to a guy and you're like

291
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:28,600
Oh, it's like about they're like weird

292
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:40,840
I think that definitely is probably why I didn't like it was cuz I thought it was gonna be like, yeah

293
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:44,760
Or a bird, you know, I think that's the problem is like that movies like

294
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:51,560
Old enough now that like every every cool marketing thing about it for us is gone. Yeah

295
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:53,360
Yeah, no, totally.

296
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:56,520
Like everyone's like, "Oh yeah, you should go see The Bird.

297
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:59,040
It's a movie about a bunch of birds attacking people."

298
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:02,640
Yeah, and then it's not really like that, really.

299
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:06,520
I will say I liked whenever they would show a bird eating a kid.

300
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:10,600
I feel like they had a lot of shots of kids on the ground like, "Ahh!" and then birds

301
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:11,600
just like...

302
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:15,040
The part where it shows the guy with his eyes pecked out was crazy.

303
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:16,880
I was not expecting that.

304
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:17,880
Spoiler alert!

305
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:22,220
the people the people next to us in the theater every time that a bird came on

306
00:15:22,220 --> 00:15:32,280
screen they were like oh oh oh oh oh yeah it would be like a scene of like a bird

307
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:38,040
pecking a guy on the hand and they're like oh no no like the most annoying

308
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:40,800
group yeah in the yeah it was so funny

309
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:48,880
protect me yeah you should have gone to

310
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:51,120

311
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:53,200
I would have rather Hawaiian roller

312
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:56,440

stitch there they've stitched Disney

world or in Hawaii oh they probably have

317
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:10,660
I thought there was something called the Hawaiian roll. I have no idea. That's just the song in the movie

318
00:16:10,660 --> 00:16:16,560
Right at Disney we had to sing that for chorus class in seventh grade

319
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:23,140
Is that weird that is weird seventh grade feels a little old to be singing. No, we won't stay I went to Disney Middle School

320

shove Bruce Banner into a locker not knowing oh I forgot that yeah this is

336
00:17:31,940 --> 00:17:34,340
Disney owns a lot of properties.

337
00:17:34,340 --> 00:17:37,140
They owned a lot of the shit back in the day too.

338
00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:38,140
Jocks.

339
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:39,140
Mm-hmm.

340
00:17:39,140 --> 00:17:40,140
Operation...

341
00:17:40,140 --> 00:17:42,500
Or the soldiers in Operation Dumbo Drop.

342
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:45,060
The Xenomorph would probably be the principal.

343
00:17:45,060 --> 00:17:46,060
Oh yeah, they own Fox.

344
00:17:46,060 --> 00:17:47,060
The mean principal.

345
00:17:47,060 --> 00:17:48,060
Yeah.

346
00:17:48,060 --> 00:17:49,060
Bro.

347
00:17:49,060 --> 00:17:51,060
Disney Middle School must be crazy now.

348
00:17:51,060 --> 00:17:53,580
Yeah, I couldn't even imagine.

349
00:17:53,580 --> 00:18:01,300

353
00:18:16,060 --> 00:18:16,820

Best friend was my teacher. Yeah he was yeah yeah. I finally I finally watched

356
00:18:29,580 --> 00:18:35,980
I didn't watch the whole series, but I watched like the final battle in the Obi-Wan series.

357
00:18:35,980 --> 00:18:41,460
Oh, yeah, I watched that too. I only watched that part and if they only showed that that'd be so cool

358
00:18:41,460 --> 00:18:47,980
It was when they're in like the rock. Yeah. Yeah, what's them? They have a new Star Wars show coming up and or yeah

359
00:18:47,980 --> 00:18:53,520

360
00:18:54,940 --> 00:19:02,060
character yeah and the first like shot of that like the trailer is like they just

361
00:19:02,060 --> 00:19:06,340

362
00:19:06,340 --> 00:19:10,860
like a Star Wars gun they should let me make a Star Wars series I've so I have a

363
00:19:10,860 --> 00:19:15,020
good idea I have an idea I've had an idea since I was a kid okay what's your

364
00:19:15,020 --> 00:19:22,460
idea off of the books so it's like there it's like this like Jedi

365
00:19:22,460 --> 00:19:29,180
No, it's a real idea I had when I was a kid. So it's like a rhodian. What's that

366
00:19:29,180 --> 00:19:34,260
mean? Like Greedo, like the green guy with like the yeah yeah Greedo and he

367
00:19:34,260 --> 00:19:43,540
smokes weed. Whoa that's cool. And his name is Green Bud the Rhodian. Okay.

368
00:19:43,540 --> 00:19:47,900
Patrick, you might need a workshop that idea buddy. Yeah I think you need to take a look.

369
00:19:47,900 --> 00:19:49,900
And he has the munchies.

370
00:19:49,900 --> 00:19:52,160
(laughter)

371
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:56,300
And it's like a limited series?

372
00:19:56,300 --> 00:19:57,860
And he totally has the munchies from Smoking Weed.

373
00:19:57,860 --> 00:19:59,740
Eight episodes, 10 episodes?

374
00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:00,580
16 episodes.

375
00:20:00,580 --> 00:20:02,780
(laughter)

376
00:20:02,780 --> 00:20:04,100
But they're short episodes.

377
00:20:04,100 --> 00:20:04,940
Okay, how long?

378
00:20:04,940 --> 00:20:05,780
30 minutes.

379
00:20:05,780 --> 00:20:06,600
Oh, okay.

380
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:08,860
(laughter)

381
00:20:08,860 --> 00:20:10,220
That's cool.

382
00:20:10,220 --> 00:20:12,380
You should get Tyga to direct some.

383
00:20:12,380 --> 00:20:14,020
I wanted him to play the Rodian.

384
00:20:14,020 --> 00:20:15,180
Oh.

385
00:20:15,180 --> 00:20:16,940
Tyga Wittidi will play the Rodian

386
00:20:16,940 --> 00:20:22,740
and then his stoner buddy played by Kevin Smith is just silent Bob. So

387
00:20:22,740 --> 00:20:28,620
there's a so it's green bud and silent Bob and they're both stoners or one of

388
00:20:28,620 --> 00:20:33,380
them just has a stone or buddy. No, they're both stoners. Okay, a few. I

389
00:20:33,380 --> 00:20:37,380
okay. I hear my star wars idea. Yeah, it's called the 100 Jedis.

390
00:20:37,380 --> 00:20:41,380
It's 100 episodes long.

391
00:20:41,380 --> 00:20:43,660
There's 100

392
00:20:43,660 --> 00:20:52,040
characters. It's an anthology show, so every episode is a completely different

393
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:56,060
story. Yeah, I've got to break the record for the most most people ever on a

394
00:20:56,060 --> 00:20:57,560
poster for a TV show.

395
00:20:57,560 --> 00:21:05,840
The trailer is a hundred minutes long, one minute from each episode. It's still

396
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:07,180
called a hundred Jedi.

397
00:21:07,180 --> 00:21:13,160
We're going to have a probably a hundred is low balling it. We're probably going

398
00:21:13,180 --> 00:21:18,460
a million people but you can't call it a season two. Yeah, the season two they

399
00:21:18,460 --> 00:21:26,440
changed the title of the show to one million. I'm so excited. Yeah it's in

400
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:29,760
production. Yeah. Yeah we're looking we're working on finding the second

401
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:41,420
character. It's in a hundred productions. That's the hardest part about casting 100 Jedi's is like you do need to find 100 Jedi's.

402
00:21:41,420 --> 00:21:45,980
like you can't just pick willy-nilly a hundred people. Yeah, he's already tied up.

403
00:21:45,980 --> 00:22:00,700
He had a scheduling conflict. I actually wrote that part for willy-nilly. Maybe we

404
00:22:00,700 --> 00:22:09,460
can get it for season two. I wrote it for willy-nilly but you know his

405
00:22:09,460 --> 00:22:14,820
schedules really tied up so we just it's Michael Shannon and he's good

406
00:22:14,820 --> 00:22:26,140
people say Michael Shannon is the poor man's really new people get him mixed up

407
00:22:26,140 --> 00:22:29,780
all the time people always think that it was Michael Shannon in in the shape of

408
00:22:29,780 --> 00:22:36,860
water but that was exactly the same he's really nearly just has shorter hair yeah

409
00:22:36,860 --> 00:22:41,020
a little bit shorter and willy-nilly is like way more evil so he plays like evil

410
00:22:41,020 --> 00:22:44,340
character but they're so hard to tell apart they even like the credits like

411
00:22:44,340 --> 00:22:47,940
they'll get them mixed up so it's like Michael Shannon in all the movies so

412
00:22:47,940 --> 00:22:51,620
like here's how you can tell willy-nilly and Michael Shannon apart so you look at

413
00:22:51,620 --> 00:22:56,180
a photo of Michael Shannon and you open it up in Photoshop and then hit flip

414
00:22:56,180 --> 00:23:06,660
horizontal and that's yeah he's pretty much like a black Michael Shannon

415
00:23:06,660 --> 00:23:16,260
he wears he wears white makeup and yeah virtually indistinguishable but he is

416
00:23:16,260 --> 00:23:23,500
black they need like a twin like they're casting a twin this guy's so good he

417
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:29,260
looks exactly like our lead actor he's perfect he is black yeah he they are

418
00:23:29,260 --> 00:23:33,500
four different races. So yeah doing that for like a stunt scene,

419
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:39,100
it's like me a mission impossible or some yeah, there's just road. Yeah,

420
00:23:39,100 --> 00:23:42,860
cruise like walking up to the edge of the skyscraper that it cuts and it's

421
00:23:42,860 --> 00:23:46,300
just like a black guy. Just it's like a five hundred pound black

422
00:23:57,020 --> 00:23:59,020
He's like, yeah, I did that. I do my own

423
00:23:59,020 --> 00:24:01,920
That was my own stunt. I did that myself

424
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:08,800
Yeah, what's that that interview it's like him talking to Matt Lauer and he's like

425
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:15,880
Like is that the psychiatry one? Yeah. Yeah. He says like like what is he the exact quote is so sick

426
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:21,820
He's awesome. Dude. The exact quote is like something like like like you don't even you don't know

427
00:24:21,820 --> 00:24:26,980
You don't know the history of psychiatry. I do. Yeah, that's what he says something about Ritalin -

428
00:24:26,980 --> 00:24:32,860
Matt Lauer yeah and sick and like calls Matt Lauer a name yeah he's like unhinged

429
00:24:32,860 --> 00:24:38,380
yeah he gets like mad at him. Dude, all the clips whenever he gets mad are so cool.

430
00:24:38,380 --> 00:24:42,180
The one where um I forget who it is someone asked him about about Nicole

431
00:24:42,180 --> 00:24:45,860
Kidman and he's like he just like keeps smiling he's like you're stepping over a

432
00:24:45,860 --> 00:24:51,300
line here oh yeah I think you know it yeah and he's just so scary yeah and when

433
00:24:51,300 --> 00:24:55,740
he jumps behind the couch on Oprah classic dude oh my god classic moment I

434
00:24:55,740 --> 00:25:00,900
I only knew about like seeing the real clip of that after only seeing it in

435
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:07,860
Scary Movie 4 is so fucking it's way better in real life. I don't know if they've actually watched it.

436
00:25:07,860 --> 00:25:12,540
I don't even know why they parodied that. They should have just played the clip in the movie.

437
00:25:12,540 --> 00:25:17,260
What they do in Superhero Movie when they do it they get that guy that looks like him.

438
00:25:17,260 --> 00:25:21,620
You know they did get a Tom Cruise impersonator. He's really good looks like him.

439
00:25:21,620 --> 00:25:23,720
I don't remember a superhero movie.

440
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:26,720
Shout out to the casting team of Superhero Movie.

441
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:30,220
I remember seeing it, but it's one of those like...

442
00:25:30,220 --> 00:25:32,120
I think it's on Amazon Prime right now.

443
00:25:32,120 --> 00:25:36,820
I've seen probably every one of those Friedberg-Setzler movies.

444
00:25:36,820 --> 00:25:39,320
I think it might be the Zucker Brothers.

445
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:40,520
Oh, that one's actually the Zuckers?

446
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:42,020
I think it's Zucker Brothers.

447
00:25:42,020 --> 00:25:44,720
I could be wrong, but I think Superhero Movie might be the Zucks.

448
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:45,720
We should watch them all.

449
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:46,320
Yeah.

450
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:46,720
I'm down.

451
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:50,520
I've seen like... I remember because when I was a kid, I was like obsessed with those.

452
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:56,600
I like like I thought date movie was awesome epic movie epic movie.

453
00:25:56,600 --> 00:26:01,760
Oh yeah, I heard they're making a new one right now that Disney's trying to shut down.

454
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:02,760
What?

455
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:03,760
100 Jedi's movie.

456
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:04,760
It's a parody of 100 Jedi's.

457
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:05,760
God, that's my dream.

458
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:14,280
I hear they're having an even harder time casting though.

459
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:15,280
Yeah.

460
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:17,040
Because it's like you have to cast like a hundred people.

461
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:22,040
I think you have to find an actor made of poop because it's one of the characters.

462
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:23,720
It's the main Jedi.

463
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:24,720
It's so funny dude.

464
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:26,520
One of the guys is made of poop.

465
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:29,800
I think the only one of those movies I ever saw was a scary movie.

466
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:37,160
Yeah, I made my, or I think we all went and saw a disaster movie in the theater.

467
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:39,080
Disaster movie is a weird one.

468
00:26:39,080 --> 00:26:43,280
Seeing disaster movie in the theater when I was like 11, I was like the only one that

469
00:26:43,280 --> 00:26:47,880
left like like that was awesome everyone else got in the car that's really funny

470
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:53,080
what it's that's maybe strange cuz that is just like a mad TV like showcase I

471
00:26:53,080 --> 00:26:57,540
feel yeah everyone in that is it was on that TV yeah it's your over that movie

472
00:26:57,540 --> 00:27:03,160
that came out when like Twilight was big vampire so I never saw that I remember

473
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:12,700
seeing like posters and stuff for that being like oh look out girls that was

474
00:27:12,700 --> 00:27:17,920
the one that finally that was the straw that broke the camel's back yeah I never

475
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:21,960
watched another Friedberg sets or movie after I was like I remember going home

476
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:28,760
on Facebook and typing making my static my status vampire sucks dot dot dot

477
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:37,480
sucks. Whoa! That's pretty good. Too big a Twilight fan. Yeah. Yeah. What team are you?

478
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:45,400
Team Star Wars. You're stupid if you think that Star Wars is in Twilight. Okay I'm not

479
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:52,640
team Star Wars. I'm team Lord of the Rings. There's no, not a single Hobbit in

480
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:56,880
Twilight. Maybe they reference it though. There is a Hobbit in Twilight but it's in

481
00:27:56,880 --> 00:28:01,000
the background. Yeah, you know, and if you miss it cameo there's a there's I mean

482
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:05,240
this hasn't been proven but if you look really closely in the background of one

483
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:08,960
of the shots and I think breaking dawn you can see a hobbit he is hanging

484
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:16,560
himself in the forest. Yeah, yeah. I don't remember if I saw Twilight or not. I

485
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:20,240
never saw those movies. No, I saw the first one and then I don't remember.

486
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:22,640
I didn't watch any of them either.

487
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:23,640
Yeah.

488
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:24,640
Gay.

489
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:25,640
Gay.

490
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:30,280
Okay, well, speaking of Patrick being gay, here's a list I've selected for us today.

00:28:36,280 --> 00:28:37,280
I'm not going to read the URL.

495
00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:38,280
I'm going to have a lot of opinions on this.

496
00:28:38,280 --> 00:28:41,880
This is a post from February 1st, 2013.

497
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:42,880
I might have made this list.

498
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:46,840
So a few days ago, Doug Walker, most famously known for the nostalgic critics.

499
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:49,600
You might have made this list.

500
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:54,400
I posted a list of his personal favorite attractive animated women after

501
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:55,400
viewing this video.

502
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:57,100
Yeah, my top 10.

503
00:28:57,100 --> 00:28:59,200
It's top 10 hottest animated one.

504
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:01,700
Okay, we had an oopsie.

505
00:29:01,700 --> 00:29:04,800
There was an oopsie there a quarter in out of space and it cut off and

506
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:07,100
we didn't notice for three minutes and in those three minutes.

507
00:29:07,100 --> 00:29:09,200
We read the whole Doug Walker list.

508
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:11,500
We read the funniest list of all time.

509
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:13,100
Yeah, ever read on this show.

510
00:29:13,100 --> 00:29:16,400
Hot is Doug Walker's list of hottest animated women.

511
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:19,100
It was really funny a gargoyle made it a appearance.

512
00:29:19,100 --> 00:29:25,220
What if we just ran through the list real quick just like said the each one yeah, I guess we could just try try and but okay

513
00:29:25,220 --> 00:29:27,480
We can do that do the impossible

514
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:32,600
I guess what everybody needs to know is that you are missing out all the hilarious jokes

515
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:36,540
We did about each one and the amount of laughs we had yeah, well

516
00:29:36,540 --> 00:29:43,020
This is just gonna be like a quick like yeah about putting fingers and belly buttons. Yeah. Yeah, there was some stuff about that

517
00:29:43,020 --> 00:29:45,020
Patrick made a very aggressive joke

518
00:29:45,620 --> 00:29:49,700
that I won't yeah, because it kind of scared me on a team and yeah, that joke

519
00:29:49,700 --> 00:29:51,500
was really number ten.

520
00:29:51,500 --> 00:29:54,140
Jamaica from baby's kids

521
00:29:54,140 --> 00:29:59,780
Patrick with that's why we know we did have the Jamaica from baby's kids was,

522
00:29:59,780 --> 00:30:03,020
but I guess she's not a kid. I think it's the mom. I mean, I hope that's

523
00:30:03,020 --> 00:30:04,740
actually double check. Yeah, what

524
00:30:04,740 --> 00:30:07,140
joke I made about Jimmy

525
00:30:07,140 --> 00:30:11,660
as a joke. I go back to this list. We should at least later in the list. Doug

526
00:30:11,660 --> 00:30:14,060
Walker says that Jasmine and

527
00:30:14,060 --> 00:30:20,100
Ariel are hotter than a certain Disney princess because they show their belly

528
00:30:20,100 --> 00:30:24,900
buttons. Yeah. Well I can't is this that this isn't the mom right? Let me see.

529
00:30:24,900 --> 00:30:30,620
There's no way this babe has kids. Or maybe you know it is the mom probably.

530
00:30:30,620 --> 00:30:32,620
That's the mom. Yeah. Damn.

531
00:30:32,620 --> 00:30:34,620
(Laughter)

532
00:30:34,620 --> 00:30:36,620
(Laughter)

533
00:30:36,620 --> 00:30:38,620
God damn.

534
00:30:38,620 --> 00:30:40,620
Okay. Okay.

535
00:30:40,620 --> 00:30:42,620
I see you Doug.

536
00:30:42,620 --> 00:30:44,620
I see you Doug. Alright.

537
00:30:44,620 --> 00:30:46,620
Alright brother. Number 9 was

538
00:30:46,620 --> 00:30:48,620
Annie Hughes from the Iron Giant.

539
00:30:48,620 --> 00:30:50,620
Yeah. Milk. I don't remember what she looks like.

540
00:30:50,620 --> 00:30:52,620
Well Doug Walker says the main

541
00:30:52,620 --> 00:30:54,620
reason is because she's voiced by Jennifer Aniston.

542
00:30:54,620 --> 00:30:56,620
Oh. Oh.

543
00:30:56,620 --> 00:30:58,620
She has a sexy voice. That's a weird reason

544
00:30:58,620 --> 00:31:03,060
to be like you know yeah that's a weird reason to be like this character is hot

545
00:31:03,060 --> 00:31:10,460
because the voice actor is beautiful what are you talking about look at those eyes

546
00:31:10,460 --> 00:31:15,940
he looks exactly like like number one mm-hmm she's almost exactly like I love

547
00:31:15,940 --> 00:31:19,580
her hair number his number eight was April O'Neil mm-hmm

548
00:31:19,580 --> 00:31:24,020
no qualms with that one no argument there my only qualms she's not higher up

549
00:31:24,020 --> 00:31:26,440
Yeah, I mean you guys like her cuz she's like 15

550
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:32,260
So Peter so is Peter Parker well, he's 12

551
00:31:32,260 --> 00:31:38,260
Takes place by Judith Hogue in the movie. Yeah. Yeah. Well, she was 12. She's a woman

552
00:31:38,260 --> 00:31:43,340
Trust she was seven. She's not she wouldn't be hanging out with them turtles if she wasn't

553
00:31:43,340 --> 00:31:48,240
Look, I know I know turn off the recorder cuz he said a lot of stuff. Yeah

554
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:52,060
That's probably when we went one dark

555
00:31:52,060 --> 00:32:03,860
look. Cameron shut off the recorders and be like look. I would do and then yeah.

556
00:32:03,860 --> 00:32:08,700
Number seven was Harley Quinn. He's you know a little crazy. I thought that Harley should

557
00:32:08,700 --> 00:32:14,660
be higher up on the list. She got BPD. Yeah, do you realize also she's dating the Joker.

558
00:32:14,660 --> 00:32:19,840
She's not going to get with you. She's not going to get with you. She actually has sex

559
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:26,440
with Nightwing in the new show. Oh yeah, I saw that clip on a certain website. I've

560
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:31,240
seen that scene. No, I saw that because it was one of those things where it's like

561
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:35,040
it recommends you to me tweets and stuff and it was like a tweet where someone's

562
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:39,960
complaining. It's like because they were like um Harley Quinn rapes Nightwing in

563
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:46,800
the new show and as a clip of it. Yeah, yeah it's a clip where he's tied up. Mm-hmm

564
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:50,480
Yeah, yeah, so what do you have to say about that? I don't think that's funny

565
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:53,600
at all. So I mean, but you still think Harley Quinn should be higher on the

566
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:56,960
list? Yeah, okay. Number six was was

567
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:57,440
demote

568
00:32:57,440 --> 00:33:09,280
which I mean demote as gargoyles go. She's pretty hot, but she's

569
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:19,340
Demona of every cartoon character in the world. I mean it's just such a

570
00:33:19,340 --> 00:33:23,920
beautiful name above directly above April O'Neil and Harley Quinn Demona

571
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:27,140
because she can kick ass like yeah

572
00:33:27,140 --> 00:33:29,080
number five was

573
00:33:29,080 --> 00:33:34,980
oh my God, I forgot the lady from the we went back to Alice Topkins from the

574
00:33:34,980 --> 00:33:35,680
creek.

575
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:40,620
What's his reasoning? Does it have literally nothing? It doesn't even say

576
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:44,600
where she's from it says i'll read you what it says here. Doug vio number

577
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:46,740
five alice tompkins interlude

578
00:33:46,740 --> 00:33:49,440
that's all it says

579
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:56,240
okay yeah number four was tiana from the princess and the frog very funny to put

580
00:33:56,240 --> 00:34:02,840
a put a couple sisters on the list. Oh yeah, you like disney princesses,

581
00:34:02,840 --> 00:34:06,840
that's funny, that's very funny, and watching a disney movie like oh my god,

582
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:08,880
Also, like, you're...

583
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:09,880
Wow!

584
00:34:09,880 --> 00:34:15,600
I guess I don't know that much about Doug Walker, but to do a top ten hottest animated women

585
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:19,520
and none of it is sexy anime girls...

586
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:24,040
Those anime girls are hot.

587
00:34:24,040 --> 00:34:26,440
They're sexy as fuck.

588
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:29,400
Let's say one, let's get one thing straight.

589
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:30,400
They are hot.

590
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:31,400
They are beautiful.

591
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:33,400
Beautiful

592
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:39,840
Some from Kingdom Hearts she was so hot yeah, or like

593
00:34:39,840 --> 00:34:46,620
Misty from Pokemon what the hell do that's a 12-year-old

594
00:34:46,620 --> 00:34:50,560
No, dude, she was 30

595
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:57,560
Mrs. Parr from the Incredibles listen was number three then number two was rogue from x-men

596
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:03,320
interesting and number one was and I'll read this out like I did last time and

597
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:09,020
Doug vo and my number one hottest animated woman is Bell. Now this is

598
00:35:09,020 --> 00:35:12,720
really ironic because in the Nostalgia Critics top 11 I said Bell didn't

599
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:15,920
qualify because you had Ariel and Jasmine and they showed their belly

600
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:20,820
buttons. Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute. Okay, is this list Doug

601
00:35:20,820 --> 00:35:26,820
Walker's top 10 or is it the Nostalgia Critics top 10 because that really

602
00:35:26,820 --> 00:35:29,700
changes kind of every single that is a

603
00:35:29,700 --> 00:35:36,200
Okay, it looks like this one is this one is Doug's top ten hottest animated women

604
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:42,420
And then there's also a link where there's a separate top 11 animated nostalgia hot. That's the stulture critic

605
00:35:42,420 --> 00:35:48,280
He'd be doing those top 11s. Yeah, cuz it goes to 11. Yeah, so that's how you know

606
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:51,440
Well, let's see what his top is the top 11

607
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:53,960
linka from Captain Planet

608
00:35:53,960 --> 00:35:56,200
(laughter)

609
00:35:56,200 --> 00:36:00,800
- To have another list that's a bunch of just

610
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:02,200
different cartoon characters.

611
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:03,480
(laughter)

612
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:05,640
- The Baroness from G.I. Joe.

613
00:36:05,640 --> 00:36:07,880
(laughter)

614
00:36:07,880 --> 00:36:09,720
- Wait, so he had a list.

615
00:36:09,720 --> 00:36:13,680
- Joe sent a list with completely different characters.

616
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:15,200
(laughter)

617
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:16,680
- I do, okay, I do respect--

618
00:36:16,680 --> 00:36:18,680
- Okay, here we go, number nine, Sailor Moon.

619
00:36:18,680 --> 00:36:19,520
- Oh, there we go.

620
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:20,640
- From Sailor Moon.

621
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:29,640
I do respect Doug Walker for being like, "No, my character would think Demonia is hot."

622
00:36:29,640 --> 00:36:31,640
Wait, here's one.

623
00:36:31,640 --> 00:36:39,640
This is a line from the transcript of Nostalgia Critic's Top 10 Animated Nostalgia Hotties.

624
00:36:39,640 --> 00:36:43,640
After Sailor Moon says, "Nostalgia Critic, as an evil monster."

625
00:36:43,640 --> 00:36:48,640
"Alright, Sailor Moon, I'm a big bad monster. What are you going to do about it?"

626
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:50,640
Oh my god, dude.

627
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:54,140
Number 8, Harley Quinn.

628
00:36:54,140 --> 00:36:56,140
Harley Quinn's back on here.

629
00:36:56,140 --> 00:36:56,640
From Batman.

630
00:36:56,640 --> 00:36:57,140
Crossover.

631
00:36:57,140 --> 00:36:57,640
Yep.

632
00:36:57,640 --> 00:37:02,140
And then we got number 7, Hello Nurse from Animaniacs.

633
00:37:02,140 --> 00:37:10,140
Number 6, Chitara from Thundercats.

634
00:37:10,140 --> 00:37:14,640
Number 5, Daphne from Scooby-Doo.

635
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:16,640
Hell yeah, that's my girl.

636
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:18,700
Number four April O'Neil, okay

637
00:37:18,700 --> 00:37:21,580
Okay number

638
00:37:21,580 --> 00:37:26,760
Three rogue from x-men okay a little bit of a little bit repetitive. Let's try and

639
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:33,680
So they're trying their tastes align here. We go number two Ariel and Jasmine Wow oh

640
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:39,580
Here's we go. Yeah. Yeah, this is a belly, but here's here here. I'll just read out this this quote from him, okay

641
00:37:39,580 --> 00:37:45,620
It's hard to choose which one of these two beauties was sexier, so I just gave them both their own number two spot

642
00:37:45,620 --> 00:37:51,280
I mean these two hotties make Barbie look like Betty Crocker with their big wide eyes and soft curvy lines

643
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:56,200
There's no doubt that Disney knew how to make our dreams come true now a lot of you might be wondering

644
00:37:56,200 --> 00:38:01,420
Why didn't I put Belle on there? Well? It's not that she wasn't beautiful smart and a well-developed character. It's just that well

645
00:38:01,420 --> 00:38:03,420
She didn't show her navel ah

646
00:38:03,420 --> 00:38:11,700
He's about that belly but loves that belly, but what about Pocahontas is Pocahontas show her belly button. He does what's up?

647
00:38:11,700 --> 00:38:17,580
No, actually she doesn't does she not I don't know maybe those a deleted scene that I saw any guesses for number one

648
00:38:17,580 --> 00:38:20,780
Dexter's mom

649
00:38:20,780 --> 00:38:24,700
Mrs. Incredible is charity on the list. It's mrs. Puff. No, I'm just kidding. No

650
00:38:24,700 --> 00:38:32,780
It's an obvious one. It's Jessica rabbit. Ah, yeah. Yeah. Actually, I remember this video now me too

651
00:38:32,780 --> 00:38:35,460
I remember every sinister critic video I've ever seen

652
00:38:35,460 --> 00:38:41,060
Okay, now that we've got the background of I can go back to

653
00:38:41,060 --> 00:38:46,820
back to to the original pick for the list my top ten hottest animated guys,

654
00:38:46,820 --> 00:38:50,540
which it's after viewing this video. My boyfriend issued me a challenge to

655
00:38:50,540 --> 00:38:53,820
write up a list of my own, but with men so long story short, these are my

656
00:38:53,820 --> 00:38:58,060
picks for animated. Here we go time for the time for the any guesses for any

657
00:38:58,060 --> 00:39:00,900
let's let's play some bets on number one. I haven't looked at number one

658
00:39:00,940 --> 00:39:11,340
get sora sora. No, I think lumiere for beauty of the beast. Yeah, flounder not

659
00:39:11,340 --> 00:39:15,900
everybody got your what y'all flounder flounder under the little mermaid. Oh my

660
00:39:15,900 --> 00:39:21,980
God, we is on get real. Oh my God, the care that all the little care of little

661
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:23,820
the little characters from clay world

662
00:39:23,820 --> 00:39:26,800
from pancake mines,

663
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:32,400
probably like guest on yeah

664
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:39,000
okay, number ten was Jafar.

665
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:44,840
Are you evil, though? Yeah, well yeah, let's listen. Let's let's hear this

666
00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:48,300
person out. I'll get this out of the way. Jafar is a douche.

667
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,000
Thank God she said that.

668
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:55,000
Well what do you expect from a villain as powerful as him?

669
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:57,000
While not the most attractive Disney villain out there,

670
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:00,000
Jafar has this smugness about him that I really like.

671
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,000
He's powerful and he knows it.

672
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,000
And he's always got a scheme cooked up.

673
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,000
He's got power, he's got money too.

674
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,000
He does have a lot of money.

675
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,000
Plus his evil laugh is one of the best I've ever heard.

676
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:13,000
He might look like he was beat with an ugly stick,

677
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:16,000
but he's easily the most attractive Disney villain to me.

678
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:20,640
to me. He's beaten by the ugly stick but he's the most attractive. Yeah, well this person's

679
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:25,200
maybe a little crazy and weird. Yeah, they got interest, they got strange tastes, it sounds like.

680
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:29,680
Yeah, I mean Jafar does, he does seem powerful. Hey, Jafar got like some flow.

681
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:36,960
Like getting like choked out by Jafar. Oh my god. What? Getting like, oh this Jafar is like,

682
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:42,800
you know, like just crushing your carotid artery. He's trying to smell some of his Jafarts. Oh my god.

683
00:40:44,320 --> 00:40:45,880
missionary with Jafar

684
00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:52,920
dude going is poised has his rope pulled up. He's holding it up going on a

685
00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:54,280
mission with Jafar

686
00:40:54,280 --> 00:41:01,840
dude when I'm about to bust in Jafari switches a genie form and flips me over

687
00:41:01,840 --> 00:41:02,520
damn

688
00:41:02,520 --> 00:41:06,880
yeah, I would love to have sex with a genie

689
00:41:08,520 --> 00:41:09,520
Me too.

690
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:11,160
Yeah, that actually would be fire.

691
00:41:11,160 --> 00:41:15,160
My next wish, last longer.

692
00:41:15,160 --> 00:41:19,440
That was good.

693
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:20,440
That's really good, man.

694
00:41:20,440 --> 00:41:25,560
Yeah, you can't wish for more wishes to bring people back to life or to last longer.

695
00:41:25,560 --> 00:41:26,560
That's what he says.

696
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:27,560
I don't even want it.

697
00:41:27,560 --> 00:41:31,960
I don't want any of it.

698
00:41:31,960 --> 00:41:36,320
Yeah, that would be so rude if you're having sex with a genie and you're trying to grant

699
00:41:36,320 --> 00:41:37,680
your wishes in the middle of it.

700
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:39,640
I wish you would not already a

701
00:41:39,640 --> 00:41:44,540
number nine any guesses

702
00:41:44,540 --> 00:41:47,140
piccolo

703
00:41:47,140 --> 00:41:54,440
it's frozen from the incredible. Okay, okay, yeah, even though he's a

704
00:41:54,440 --> 00:41:58,420
supporting character frozen is one of my favorites from the Incredibles for

705
00:41:58,420 --> 00:42:02,840
starters. He has a sleek design which works perfectly with the ice powers. He

706
00:42:02,860 --> 00:42:07,700
yeah his skin is so sleek. There's something so cool about frozen.

707
00:42:07,700 --> 00:42:09,420
This is an

708
00:42:09,420 --> 00:42:17,500
urban chill. Yeah, something chill yeah yeah, I think of like like ice crystals.

709
00:42:17,500 --> 00:42:19,580
Look at him. He's like a black crystal

710
00:42:19,580 --> 00:42:29,140
something about his ice makes me think of sparkling jewelry. Yeah, it's like

711
00:42:29,140 --> 00:42:30,700
black ice on the sidewalk.

712
00:42:30,700 --> 00:42:32,960
(laughing)

713
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:38,060
- Something about him makes me think of a sidewalk.

714
00:42:38,060 --> 00:42:44,380
He's the kind of down to earth guy that while he enjoys

715
00:42:44,380 --> 00:42:47,500
doing the superhero thing, enjoys having a bit of normalcy,

716
00:42:47,500 --> 00:42:49,300
at least more than Mr. Incredible.

717
00:42:49,300 --> 00:42:51,940
- Yeah, Mr. Incredible is having a midlife crisis.

718
00:42:51,940 --> 00:42:55,340
- Yeah, and to top it all off, he's voiced by Samuel L. Jackson

719
00:42:55,340 --> 00:42:57,820
who has one of the most recognizable and in my opinion,

720
00:42:57,820 --> 00:42:59,500
attractive voices out there.

721
00:42:59,500 --> 00:43:05,020
Okay, all right. I guess that yeah, this girl likes some tall dark and handsome. I think we're noticing a theme and ice power

722
00:43:05,020 --> 00:43:12,660
Either genie or ice powers. Yeah, you could wish like you could be like genie. I wish you had ice

723
00:43:12,660 --> 00:43:17,060
I'm looking for a guy with a sleek design and ice powers

724
00:43:17,060 --> 00:43:27,100
I fucking hate like on tinder you go people are like I need a guy who's over six feet and that B is able to control

725
00:43:27,100 --> 00:43:29,380
It's like, oh my god.

726
00:43:29,380 --> 00:43:31,100
It's a shallowness of women.

727
00:43:31,100 --> 00:43:32,780
Women only like guys with sleek designs.

728
00:43:32,780 --> 00:43:33,780
It is.

729
00:43:33,780 --> 00:43:38,060
And basically all of us guys with big robot arms don't get any attention.

730
00:43:38,060 --> 00:43:41,420
It's hard to me, people are, like girls our age just only want guys with powers.

731
00:43:41,420 --> 00:43:42,420
It's really, uh.

732
00:43:42,420 --> 00:43:46,140
Yeah, I mean a guy like me, who's like, I look more like Bebop and Rocksteady.

733
00:43:46,140 --> 00:43:47,140
Yeah, good luck.

734
00:43:47,140 --> 00:43:48,140
Yeah.

735
00:43:48,140 --> 00:43:49,140
Good fucking luck, dude.

736
00:43:49,140 --> 00:43:50,140
I know.

737
00:43:50,140 --> 00:43:51,140
Oh my god.

738
00:43:51,140 --> 00:43:52,140
She's looking for more of a Pleakley type.

739
00:43:52,140 --> 00:43:53,140
Looking for a Pleakley type.

740
00:43:53,140 --> 00:43:54,140
Looking for something.

741
00:43:54,140 --> 00:43:55,500
(laughter)

742
00:43:55,500 --> 00:43:57,180
- Looking for a pleat cleat type.

743
00:43:57,180 --> 00:43:59,380
- Looking for someone who looks exactly like a pleat cleat.

744
00:43:59,380 --> 00:44:00,900
- She wants like a Gazzorno type,

745
00:44:00,900 --> 00:44:02,700
which is actually a character I just created.

746
00:44:02,700 --> 00:44:03,540
- Oh really?

747
00:44:03,540 --> 00:44:04,360
- Yeah.

748
00:44:04,360 --> 00:44:05,620
- What does he look like?

749
00:44:05,620 --> 00:44:08,700
- Let's describe Gazzorno real quick.

750
00:44:08,700 --> 00:44:10,700
- He's 700 feet tall.

751
00:44:10,700 --> 00:44:12,660
(laughter)

752
00:44:12,660 --> 00:44:13,860
And he's invisible.

753
00:44:13,860 --> 00:44:16,600
He's completely transparent.

754
00:44:16,600 --> 00:44:20,380
- Number eight is, I don't know,

755
00:44:20,380 --> 00:44:21,300
I've never heard of this guy.

756
00:44:21,300 --> 00:44:22,500
I don't know if you guys have.

757
00:44:22,500 --> 00:44:23,820
Martin Mystery.

758
00:44:23,820 --> 00:44:24,660
- Oh!

759
00:44:24,660 --> 00:44:26,140
- From Martin Mysteries.

760
00:44:26,140 --> 00:44:28,700
- I'm always telling jokes about that show.

761
00:44:28,700 --> 00:44:32,340
Martin Mysteries was like a show on like Nicktoons.

762
00:44:32,340 --> 00:44:34,540
And I feel like I was the only one who watched that

763
00:44:34,540 --> 00:44:36,140
when I was a kid, but it's like,

764
00:44:36,140 --> 00:44:37,980
he's like a blonde guy with like fire.

765
00:44:37,980 --> 00:44:39,500
- Yeah, that's what it looks like here.

766
00:44:39,500 --> 00:44:41,020
- Yeah, that show rocked.

767
00:44:41,020 --> 00:44:42,500
- It says, "Many people won't know this guy,

768
00:44:42,500 --> 00:44:45,440
"but I first discovered him on a kid's channel called YTV,

769
00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:48,220
"essentially the Nickelodeon of Canadian programming.

770
00:44:48,220 --> 00:44:49,920
"While Tuxedo Mask from Sailor Moon

771
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:52,140
"was the first anime guy I ever saw,

772
00:44:52,140 --> 00:44:56,220
Martin was the first I ever found remotely attractive. He has boyish good

773
00:44:56,220 --> 00:44:59,980
looks and a lot of energy and spunk. He does. He's not the brightest character in

774
00:44:59,980 --> 00:45:03,100
the show but he's extremely loyal to his friends and sister and has a fun sense

775
00:45:03,100 --> 00:45:06,940
of humor as well. He's the one the show is named after. Martin Mystery. That show

776
00:45:06,940 --> 00:45:10,460
was so cool. They would like, it was like a supernatural, it was like a

777
00:45:10,460 --> 00:45:13,500
like a spin, it was like a Scooby-Doo kind of thing.

778
00:45:13,500 --> 00:45:16,860
But they all had powers? No, they were just, it was like him and then I think I

779
00:45:16,860 --> 00:45:19,100
guess the girl was his sister and then like a

780
00:45:19,100 --> 00:45:24,940
caveman that they found and they would go on like adventures together it was really cool

781
00:45:24,940 --> 00:45:25,940
and it was all like ghosts.

782
00:45:25,940 --> 00:45:27,660
How does a caveman fit into it?

783
00:45:27,660 --> 00:45:30,460
Or he was like a descendant of a caveman or some shit I don't know.

784
00:45:30,460 --> 00:45:31,460
I think we all are.

785
00:45:31,460 --> 00:45:32,460
No it was different.

786
00:45:32,460 --> 00:45:33,460
Not me, not me.

787
00:45:33,460 --> 00:45:34,460
I came from angels.

788
00:45:34,460 --> 00:45:37,620
I'm a descendant from a fish actually.

789
00:45:37,620 --> 00:45:39,620
I have a lot of neanderthal DNA.

790
00:45:39,620 --> 00:45:40,620
Yeah.

791
00:45:40,620 --> 00:45:41,620
We talked about it.

792
00:45:41,620 --> 00:45:42,620
Yeah?

793
00:45:42,620 --> 00:45:44,220
Yeah I think I'm like 56th percentile.

794
00:45:44,220 --> 00:45:47,700
I'm 50th percentile for angel and 50th for demon.

795
00:45:47,700 --> 00:45:51,500
Yo, I wouldn't I would keep the demon part. I would keep my hush hush on that

796
00:45:51,500 --> 00:45:58,380
I don't let I wouldn't broadcast that just cuz you never know who's listening. Okay good point. That's actually a really good point

797
00:45:58,380 --> 00:46:04,520
Trying to number as a friend number seven is Milo from Atlantis the Lost Empire. Yeah

798
00:46:04,520 --> 00:46:11,300
Yeah, Milo has all the qualities about nerdy guys that I love. Yep. He's a little bit awkward, which is adorable

799
00:46:11,300 --> 00:46:17,280
He's intelligent and knowledgeable, which is always a plus and he's also got a good sense of humor as well

800
00:46:17,280 --> 00:46:22,280
Another thing I loved about the character was his drive and determination to find Atlantis.

801
00:46:22,280 --> 00:46:24,280
*laughter*

802
00:46:24,280 --> 00:46:29,800
Couple

803
00:46:29,800 --> 00:46:37,240
I'm fucking I I say that no girl wants anything to do with me

804
00:46:37,240 --> 00:46:40,740
Bullshit

805
00:46:40,740 --> 00:46:42,740
I'm meeting guys

806
00:46:42,740 --> 00:46:44,740
I'm meeting guys who are determined to find a man to say

807
00:46:44,740 --> 00:46:46,740
You're on a first date

808
00:46:46,740 --> 00:46:48,740
Like oh what do you do? What's like your goal in life?

809
00:46:48,740 --> 00:46:50,740

811
00:46:51,580 --> 00:46:53,700
- You're like, I just wanna find Atlantis.

812
00:46:53,700 --> 00:46:56,780
- Annoyed at your girlfriend, I'm trying to find Atlantis.

813
00:46:56,780 --> 00:46:58,980
- Oh my God. - Yeah, yeah you are.

814
00:46:58,980 --> 00:47:02,260
- Can you please like take out the trash, excuse me!

815
00:47:02,260 --> 00:47:04,340
- This is my me time. - Will you get this?

816
00:47:04,340 --> 00:47:06,600
- This is the time I try and pinpoint

817
00:47:06,600 --> 00:47:08,580
the location of Atlantis, okay?

818
00:47:08,580 --> 00:47:11,520
I get home from work, I wanna crack a beer,

819
00:47:11,520 --> 00:47:13,300
I wanna unwind, I wanna sit in my armchair,

820
00:47:13,300 --> 00:47:16,620
and I wanna scan the earth with my GPS device.

821
00:47:16,620 --> 00:47:17,540
- Where are you?

00:47:19,700 --> 00:47:23,780
where is your girlfriend's calling you're supposed to be home like three

823
00:47:23,780 --> 00:47:27,660
hours ago and it's like i'm in the middle of the atlantic yeah, oh wait,

824
00:47:27,660 --> 00:47:29,620
what time was dinner with your parents

825
00:47:29,620 --> 00:47:31,780
a little

826
00:47:31,780 --> 00:47:42,660
and he falls in love with an atlantean that could actually write it.

827
00:47:46,820 --> 00:47:51,520
Wait a second an animated movie, but a guy is driven to find land Disney

828
00:47:51,520 --> 00:47:58,140
Okay, we actually have the Atlantis VHS in our oh yeah, I thought that movie was pretty cool

829
00:47:58,140 --> 00:48:00,940
I liked it when I was a kid. Yeah, I only saw one time

830
00:48:00,940 --> 00:48:03,460
I think I feel like most movies I watched when I was a kid

831
00:48:03,460 --> 00:48:08,300
I saw like ten times in that movie, but that Michael J. Fox is is Milo

832
00:48:08,300 --> 00:48:14,060
Which is right here Atlantis and treasure planet. Yeah, oh you know I might be confusing them right now

833
00:48:14,060 --> 00:48:16,060
I think I might be thinking about Treasure Planet.

834
00:48:16,060 --> 00:48:18,060
Treasure Planet was cool.

835
00:48:18,060 --> 00:48:20,060
That's JGL. Joseph Gordon-Levitt.

836
00:48:20,060 --> 00:48:22,060
Oh my god.

837
00:48:22,060 --> 00:48:24,060
What happens in that one? They go to a planet?

838
00:48:24,060 --> 00:48:26,060
Yeah.

839
00:48:26,060 --> 00:48:28,060
That's pretty sick.

840
00:48:28,060 --> 00:48:30,060
I don't remember anything about it.

841
00:48:30,060 --> 00:48:32,060
That was like, they, um, it was like

842
00:48:32,060 --> 00:48:34,060
yeah, it was 2D animation

843
00:48:34,060 --> 00:48:36,060
and 3D animation.

844
00:48:36,060 --> 00:48:38,060
Bit of a blend.

845
00:48:38,060 --> 00:48:40,060
Yeah, because there's that little pink guy, little fucker.

846
00:48:40,060 --> 00:48:42,060
Oh yeah, the bubble guy.

847
00:48:42,060 --> 00:48:47,420
This guy was bubble fuck bubble fuck bubble fuck the pink clown and then the

848
00:48:47,420 --> 00:48:51,900
crazy robot that they find do you that guy's awesome is funny number six

849
00:48:51,900 --> 00:48:57,820
Batman Wow from Batman the animated series where do I start with this Batman

850
00:48:57,820 --> 00:49:01,820
for one he's cool and smart like any Batman should be he has the great

851
00:49:01,820 --> 00:49:05,340
ear-catching voice of Kevin Conroy which gives the character a lot of weight in

852
00:49:05,340 --> 00:49:09,820
both humorous and dramatic situations and of course it's Batman one of the

853
00:49:09,820 --> 00:49:13,340
coolest superheroes ever put on screen from his great gadgets to as many layers

854
00:49:13,340 --> 00:49:17,420
as a person for me, though this Batman was also who got me into comic book

855
00:49:17,420 --> 00:49:20,740
heroes. Well, he's not my favorite superhero. We'll get to that. He

856
00:49:20,740 --> 00:49:22,160
definitely left an impact.

857
00:49:22,160 --> 00:49:27,140
That's kind of a boring pick. Yeah, but I get it. You know, I like this person. I

858
00:49:27,140 --> 00:49:30,700
like whoever wrote this lister given us a really good reasons for the well

859
00:49:30,700 --> 00:49:33,460
number five. I'm really curious to hear the reason this one's kind of a curve

860
00:49:33,460 --> 00:49:36,300
ball. I think ready. The number five is sideshow Bob.

861
00:49:36,300 --> 00:49:37,300
What

862
00:49:37,820 --> 00:49:39,820
Wait a minute, for real?

863
00:49:39,820 --> 00:49:41,820
He's not good, dude.

864
00:49:41,820 --> 00:49:43,820
Neither was Jafar.

865
00:49:43,820 --> 00:49:47,820
I think Saijobob is more evil than Jafar, though.

866
00:49:47,820 --> 00:49:51,820
God, Jafar is evil too.

867
00:49:51,820 --> 00:49:56,820
I know, I know, this is a weird choice, especially coming ahead of Batman.

868
00:49:56,820 --> 00:49:58,820
But the thing is, I'm a huge Simpsons fan.

869
00:49:58,820 --> 00:50:02,820
Compared to the Batman show, I grew up with the Simpsons through most of my childhood.

870
00:50:02,820 --> 00:50:06,820
Saijobob, to me, was one of the most attractive characters to appear in that show.

871
00:50:06,820 --> 00:50:07,660
(laughter)

872
00:50:07,660 --> 00:50:11,020
- Women love to be attracted to a weird looking guy.

873
00:50:11,020 --> 00:50:14,660
- I love his obsession and devotion to trying to kill Bart

874
00:50:14,660 --> 00:50:17,700
and how many plans he'll try to accomplish that.

875
00:50:17,700 --> 00:50:19,900
I love how despite having been a clown,

876
00:50:19,900 --> 00:50:21,380
he's always been sophisticated

877
00:50:21,380 --> 00:50:23,060
with his taste in literature and music.

878
00:50:23,060 --> 00:50:25,020
- It's true, he's an artful clown.

879
00:50:25,020 --> 00:50:28,340
- Yeah, she really likes obsession and devotion.

880
00:50:28,340 --> 00:50:29,180
- It's like when women say they're attracted

881
00:50:29,180 --> 00:50:31,100
to friggin' Nathan Fielder, pretty much.

882
00:50:31,100 --> 00:50:32,500
- That's an even better rom-com,

883
00:50:32,500 --> 00:50:35,020
is like, "Honey, where are you?

884
00:50:35,020 --> 00:50:35,860
You're supposed to meet my parents tonight."

885
00:50:35,860 --> 00:50:39,520
my parents and I'm so I have to kill kill out killing by my nemesis

886
00:50:39,520 --> 00:50:47,120
I'm trying to kill Bart Simpson. It's my weekend. I'm trying to kill Bart

887
00:50:47,120 --> 00:50:53,860
number four. I don't know who this is neuro from Majin Tante Nugami neuro. I

888
00:50:53,860 --> 00:50:58,140
know that oh that's me yeah. We can just move on from that. If you've read my

889
00:50:58,140 --> 00:51:01,020
first blog post, you'll know this is a recent one. I only saw the show last

890
00:51:01,020 --> 00:51:04,260
month, but neuro left such an impression that I couldn't leave him on the list

891
00:51:04,340 --> 00:51:08,180
the list. While Bob is obsessed with killing Bart, he always gets caught in the end. Nero's

892
00:51:08,180 --> 00:51:12,340
obsession with feeding off of mysteries always ends in triumph. He never ever gives up until

893
00:51:12,340 --> 00:51:15,740
he gets what he wants. Physically, his human form is pretty attractive, sort of like a

894
00:51:15,740 --> 00:51:21,220
demonic mixed version of Miles Edgeworth and Phoenix Wright from the Ace Attorney series.

895
00:51:21,220 --> 00:51:25,620
While he doesn't understand humans, he's the kind of demon whose presence and voice

896
00:51:25,620 --> 00:51:28,140
commands attention, and his demonic powers are truly awesome.

897
00:51:28,140 --> 00:51:33,860
So she got you got them like the guy who's winning and then like you got the guy who's like, you know taking the L's

898
00:51:33,860 --> 00:51:40,380
So I think the ladies are always gonna go for the guy who's got taking the W's and that's just a little something about the female

899
00:51:40,380 --> 00:51:45,980
Species. Yeah, they also prefer guys with demonic powers. You can get demonic powers

900
00:51:45,980 --> 00:51:49,940
That's all about powers obsession devotion and your equal era

901
00:51:49,940 --> 00:51:52,700
obsession

902
00:51:54,780 --> 00:52:00,740
True. Oh my God. I love having an obsession. Yeah, me too. Yeah

903
00:52:00,740 --> 00:52:07,600
Number three is

904
00:52:07,600 --> 00:52:11,820
Wolverine from x-men evolution, okay, I'll be honest

905
00:52:11,820 --> 00:52:14,560
I never grew up with the original and 90s x-men cartoon

906
00:52:14,560 --> 00:52:18,100
But I did come across this one later in life and enjoyed it immensely

907
00:52:18,100 --> 00:52:23,980
This is the guy Batman led me to a surly burly Canadian mutant with the no-nonsense attitude

908
00:52:23,980 --> 00:52:28,860
Yeah, Wolverine already ranks high on my favorite superheroes list but between this show in the first live-action film

909
00:52:28,860 --> 00:52:32,740
I came to see him as attractive - yeah aside from the quick traits just listed

910
00:52:32,740 --> 00:52:36,580
I think another aspect is the mystery behind him while he may not always be a team player

911
00:52:36,580 --> 00:52:42,960
He's definitely my favorite x-men guy of the bunch. Yeah, mine is Nightcrawler. Yeah from x-men evolutions

912
00:52:42,960 --> 00:52:45,820
Still nightcrawler. I think beast

913
00:52:45,820 --> 00:52:51,540
What was x-men evolution that was that the Disney one that that was x-men evolutions was yes

914
00:52:51,540 --> 00:52:54,620
I believe it was on Disney. Like the newer one? Yeah, that's the one

915
00:52:54,620 --> 00:52:58,340
They sold all the they had all the toys at Burger King

916
00:52:58,340 --> 00:53:05,360
Yeah, they all and I had I think I had most of them growing up. Yeah, I think yeah. Oh my god

917
00:53:05,360 --> 00:53:10,620
That's cool. You know cuz Batman is for you know, it's a little bit of like oh, there's a bit of mystery

918
00:53:10,620 --> 00:53:17,560
You know, I'm attracted to the mystery and no mystery. No mystery. It's like this guy is dirty. This guy is a

919
00:53:17,560 --> 00:53:19,560
Yes

920
00:53:19,560 --> 00:53:28,240
Giant like metal bones giant like razor-sharp claws violence. Yeah. Yeah

921
00:53:28,240 --> 00:53:30,900
experimented on

922
00:53:30,900 --> 00:53:38,040
Dark past trauma PTSD. He could wake up in the middle of the night and stab you to death exactly doesn't doesn't know his friends from

923
00:53:38,040 --> 00:53:39,240
his foes

924
00:53:39,240 --> 00:53:44,760
From time to time against a Magneto countless times fought the Hulk in a comic only survivor

925
00:53:44,760 --> 00:53:52,300
driver. Oh wait, that was dead pool. No he fought the wolverine everybody

926
00:53:52,300 --> 00:53:58,060
thought everybody I'm sure he fought him at some point over in planet or old

927
00:53:58,060 --> 00:53:58,780
man Logan

928
00:53:58,780 --> 00:54:01,860
he fights the whole

929
00:54:01,860 --> 00:54:08,560
does he actually I think the I forget, but like the United States is like

930
00:54:08,560 --> 00:54:12,580
chopped up into four different Wolverine chopped up the United States.

931
00:54:12,620 --> 00:54:20,140
has on stops for different factions and I think the Hulk owns like the Hulk turns

932
00:54:20,140 --> 00:54:30,660
evil. Are you serious? Yes, I think owns the Hulk is like a control of like I

933
00:54:30,660 --> 00:54:36,060
forget what he's like the president or he just like owns them. He's like the

934
00:54:36,060 --> 00:54:40,740
president of like the West Coast. I think it all damn. That's pretty sick.

935
00:54:40,980 --> 00:54:42,460
Old Man Logan is sick.

936
00:54:42,460 --> 00:54:43,460
Old Man Logan.

937
00:54:43,460 --> 00:54:45,260
Is that the one that they based that movie on?

938
00:54:45,260 --> 00:54:46,260
Yeah.

939
00:54:46,260 --> 00:54:47,980
Does that have President Hulk in it?

940
00:54:47,980 --> 00:54:49,980
I mean look up if he's the president.

941
00:54:49,980 --> 00:54:50,980
I should check that out.

942
00:54:50,980 --> 00:54:51,980
That does sound cool.

943
00:54:51,980 --> 00:54:52,980
I liked Logan.

944
00:54:52,980 --> 00:54:53,980
I thought that movie was funny.

945
00:54:53,980 --> 00:54:54,980
I never saw that one.

946
00:54:54,980 --> 00:54:55,980
Logan is sick.

947
00:54:55,980 --> 00:54:56,980
Yeah.

948
00:54:56,980 --> 00:54:57,980
That's good.

949
00:54:57,980 --> 00:54:58,980
I should watch it.

950
00:54:58,980 --> 00:54:59,980
Yeah.

951
00:54:59,980 --> 00:55:00,980
That was the year of two Calabans.

952
00:55:00,980 --> 00:55:01,980
What was the other one?

953
00:55:01,980 --> 00:55:06,820
It was Stephen Merchant and then some other guy in X-Men Apocalypse.

954
00:55:06,820 --> 00:55:14,460
then in old old man Logan Caliban is just like a wimp. He's like a wimp in Logan I

955
00:55:14,460 --> 00:55:21,000
think. Or I mean no no I mean in Logan he's a wimp. Oh yeah yeah. And then in X-Men

956
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:25,600
Apocalypse he's like he's like played like the Nightman. I don't remember.

957
00:55:25,600 --> 00:55:32,940
He's like like you're trying to find a mutant. Oh wait yeah I kind of remember a little bit.

958
00:55:32,940 --> 00:55:38,500
Apocalypse is on with Oscar eyes. Yeah, and he looks like Ivan ooze. He looks awesome. Yeah, he looks so funny

959
00:55:38,500 --> 00:55:41,100
he looks like

960
00:55:41,100 --> 00:55:45,340
He should be he looks like he should be in in freakin the fifth element

961
00:55:45,340 --> 00:55:51,980
Yes, yep. Yes all his blue skin and a strange apparatus everything you're saying yes words out of my mouth. Yes

962
00:55:51,980 --> 00:55:57,860
Yeah, sorry this turned into a bit of a sci-fi nerd corner nerding out right now a few references

963
00:55:57,860 --> 00:56:02,380
Might not understand what we're talking about

964
00:56:02,380 --> 00:56:07,420
about right now. That's okay. Yeah, so it belonged to Obama Nation and then the

965
00:56:07,420 --> 00:56:11,340
Hulk conquered it and now the Hulk owns that. Wait, so half of it was Obama's Nation.

966
00:56:11,340 --> 00:56:18,700
Obama versus the Hulk. Yeah. Oh, and then Red Skull is president of the United States. Oh my god.

967
00:56:18,700 --> 00:56:23,300
That's, I mean, that is, that's scary as fuck. That's satirical. I mean, we basically had

968
00:56:23,300 --> 00:56:31,820
orange skull. Oh my god. Yeah. Wow. Yeah. Yeah. Is that Nazi? Yeah, pretty much dude. Super

969
00:56:31,820 --> 00:56:39,220
fragile, callous, racist, sexist, Nazi POTUS. Who's that? I thought I saw an animal. It was

970
00:56:39,220 --> 00:56:43,240
just a bird. I guess a bird's an animal. Hey man, respect nature. I thought it could be

971
00:56:43,240 --> 00:56:48,140
a werewolf or a donio. I'm afraid of birds. Beast. Oh my god, I shouldn't even mention

972
00:56:48,140 --> 00:56:57,040
and all right, who's number two number two, Aladdin from yeah, Aladdin's

973
00:56:57,040 --> 00:57:00,500
mystery. I don't have anything. This one goes back into my childhood of all

974
00:57:00,500 --> 00:57:03,340
the Disney man. I saw throughout my life. Aladdin was easily the most

975
00:57:03,340 --> 00:57:07,020
interesting. He wasn't just another rich prince looking for a princess, but

976
00:57:07,020 --> 00:57:11,540
instead a humble street boy just trying to get by yeah, street boy. He knows

977
00:57:11,540 --> 00:57:14,620
how to handle himself in a fight for the most part and has this sense of

978
00:57:14,640 --> 00:57:18,320
discovery and adventure about him. Of course, physically he's both handsome and

979
00:57:18,320 --> 00:57:21,840
cute, jumping between trying to act suave and being a little awkward at times.

980
00:57:21,840 --> 00:57:25,740
While he pretty much has self-esteem issues, he's the kind of guy whose heart's

981
00:57:25,740 --> 00:57:29,840
in the right place. If my number one pick never existed, Aladdin would have easily

982
00:57:29,840 --> 00:57:32,340
nabbed the top spot of this list.

983
00:57:32,340 --> 00:57:35,740
Yeah, yeah. I'm excited to see who number one is. Aladdin's pretty, yeah, across

984
00:57:35,740 --> 00:57:39,040
the board, you know. He's got, he's a good guy. He's got those, those, that's

985
00:57:39,040 --> 00:57:40,140
got a sense of discovery.

986
00:57:40,140 --> 00:57:44,040
Sense of discovery. He's ambitious. He wants to marry Jasmine.

987
00:57:44,040 --> 00:57:45,800
He dresses like a slut.

988
00:57:45,800 --> 00:57:46,800
Yeah he is a slut.

989
00:57:46,800 --> 00:57:47,800
He shows his belly button.

990
00:57:47,800 --> 00:57:48,800
That vest, oh my god.

991
00:57:48,800 --> 00:57:49,800
Oh my god dude, he is such a slut.

992
00:57:49,800 --> 00:57:50,800
That little, that fez.

993
00:57:50,800 --> 00:57:51,800
He's such a slut dude.

994
00:57:51,800 --> 00:57:52,800
Oh my god, those pants.

995
00:57:52,800 --> 00:57:53,800
Dude, but I have to say.

996
00:57:53,800 --> 00:57:54,800
You know why they're so big at the bottom?

997
00:57:54,800 --> 00:57:55,800
They're holding his balls.

998
00:57:55,800 --> 00:57:56,800
Yeah, Aladdin's sexy, but I have to say, I'm more into his friend.

999
00:57:56,800 --> 00:57:57,800
Fijini?

1000
00:57:57,800 --> 00:57:58,800
Abu.

1001
00:57:58,800 --> 00:57:59,800
His friend.

1002
00:57:59,800 --> 00:58:00,800
Oh my god.

1003
00:58:00,800 --> 00:58:01,800
Oh man, Abu.

1004
00:58:01,800 --> 00:58:02,800
Little, little, little, little, little, little, little, little, little, little, little, little,

1006
00:58:03,800 --> 00:58:15,200
his friend. Fugenie? Abu? His friend? Oh my god. Oh man, Abu. Little, little, little thing.

1007
00:58:15,200 --> 00:58:23,800
Little ball of sexiness. I'm sorry New York for the monkey pox outbreak. This was all

1008
00:58:23,800 --> 00:58:27,800
It's all my fault. I was masturbating to a picture of Abu.

1009
00:58:27,800 --> 00:58:35,800
It's all my fault. Just go into an urgent care and start saving.

1010
00:58:35,800 --> 00:58:37,800
Abu did have that like sexy attitude though.

1011
00:58:37,800 --> 00:58:41,800
I mean I won't say like his body was hot but you have to admit like.

1012
00:58:41,800 --> 00:58:42,800
That's true.

1013
00:58:42,800 --> 00:58:47,800
The way he acted.

1014
00:58:47,800 --> 00:58:49,800
Yeah, he's number one.

1015
00:58:49,800 --> 00:58:51,800
Alright, come on we need a few guesses here for number one.

1016
00:58:52,800 --> 00:58:55,360

1017
