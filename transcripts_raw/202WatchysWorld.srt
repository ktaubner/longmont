1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,000
(music)

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Big clap.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:20,000
(music)

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
You do sound like Bruno Mars with all the high voice.

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
(music)

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Whoa.

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
(music)

8
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,700
Is that Bruno Mars that sings that?

9
00:00:30,700 --> 00:00:44,000
They might say hey, they might say hi.

10
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:49,200
But they might wonder who might be died. Who might gonna die? They got

11
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:52,400
nothing. They might say hey, they might say hi. I'm getting it. You might say

12
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:58,500
hey, and I might say hi, but we never were, or not. You might say hi, and I

13
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:00,500
might say hey, but we never worry about what they say.

14
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:01,500
Yeah.

15
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:03,500
Because they got nothing on you, nothing on you, babe.

16
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:04,500
Nothing on you.

17
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:06,500
That's Bruno Mars featuring Travi McCoy.

18
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:08,500
I remember the nothing on you part of that song.

19
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:09,500
I remember hearing that.

20
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:12,500
I never paid attention enough to it to realize I was talking about saying hey and hi.

21
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:14,500
Is it Travi McCoy or is it Bob?

22
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:15,500
Oh, I think it's Bob.

23
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:16,500
I think that one is Bob, actually.

24
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:17,500
Yeah.

25
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:19,500
That's so funny to make that song.

26
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:27,500
Pretty much all of Bob's career is just like magic by Bruno Mars, that song, like the most

27
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:33,900
poppy bullshit and then he's like Bruno Mars or magic by by B. O. B. with

28
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:39,820
rivers Cuomo and then he's immediately like the earth is flat. Everything has a

29
00:01:39,820 --> 00:01:44,380
global conspiracy. Hidden Valley. It wasn't it took him a while to get the

30
00:01:44,380 --> 00:01:47,980
hidden Valley. The hidden Valley is actually in Africa. This is a theory

31
00:01:47,980 --> 00:01:51,260
that me and Patrick have been working on guys. They're trying to hide it from

32
00:01:51,260 --> 00:01:54,380
you. They're saying white people and they're saying white people invented

33
00:01:54,380 --> 00:02:00,080
ranch. No, it's not white. No, no, no, no. Hidden Valley has is a valley. I mean

34
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:04,460
it's hidden because it uses Wakanda technology to have a hidden completely

35
00:02:04,460 --> 00:02:09,160
screen around guys. Open your fucking eyes. Ranch dressing was invented in

36
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:10,180
Africa. Yeah.

37
00:02:10,180 --> 00:02:16,540
Ranch dressing. Think about it. Ranch. That's the stupidest thing we've ever

38
00:02:16,540 --> 00:02:16,940
said.

39
00:02:16,940 --> 00:02:18,780
Ranch.

40
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:24,300
It's the stupidest fucking thing we've ever said. Dressing. Black guys are good

41
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:29,100
invented dressing better than white guys. You think a white guy invented

42
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:32,000
dressing you are actually stupid,

43
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:39,060
just my theory yeah, but that's just a theory, a theory theory. Do you remember

44
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:39,500
that when

45
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:45,460
when when B. O. B. Went flat earth crazy whenever that was I remember it like

46
00:02:45,460 --> 00:02:46,140
the day my

47
00:02:47,820 --> 00:02:51,240
being like okay. So B O B is literally a Nazi yeah

48
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:57,900
really. What is this? They're like well, don't you realize that a lot of

49
00:02:57,900 --> 00:03:02,140
flat earth theorem theorists are actually originally Nazis yeah. I mean

50
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:02,680
that is

51
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:07,500
a Nazi, not flat earth actually now that I'm thinking about it, they like, but

52
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:11,260
that was that was what hollow earth. Oh, that's what people are all earth.

53
00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:17,300
I just made up a big. There was a theory that young thug had a new earth that

54
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:20,440
the earth is tall. He had he he said you've never seen the video where he

55
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:24,240
says they discovered a new earth. It's exactly the same as this earth. It's

56
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:24,740
twice the

57
00:03:24,740 --> 00:03:26,060
everyone

58
00:03:26,060 --> 00:03:31,800
is two times this and I'm from there way. That means that you've never seen

59
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:35,140
it. No, I've never seen that means he's a little as you are yeah. That means

60
00:03:35,140 --> 00:03:39,660
all tall earth is a theory. I just came up with where the earth is a cylinder

61
00:03:39,660 --> 00:03:42,160
planet man. Yeah, he's from new earth

62
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:45,960
Whoa. And it's in French?

63
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:47,960
It's the same as this Earth.

64
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:49,960
It's Earth though. It looks identical.

65
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:51,960
Everything is the same.

66
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:53,960
You ain't heard of that yet?

67
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:55,960
It's ten times bigger than Earth.

68
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:57,960
It's another Earth they just found.

69
00:03:57,960 --> 00:03:59,960
It looks just like Earth though.

70
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:01,960
So they call it Earth. I'm probably from there.

71
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:03,960
I don't think I'm from here.

72
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:05,960
This.

73
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:07,960
That's so sick, man.

74
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:09,960
Ten times bigger.

75
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:11,960
Ten times bigger.

76
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:14,800
ten times. He's definitely not from a place ten times bigger. I don't think

77
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:18,080
he's a big guy. No, no, no remember that article that came out a couple not a

78
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:21,760
couple, maybe ten years ago, this point where it was like some reporter follows

79
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:24,340
him around and he doesn't eat yeah. That was like

80
00:04:24,340 --> 00:04:28,840
he's like he gets eat only eats out of vending machines and I was two cheetos

81
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:32,480
and be like oh, I'm full and then well that was that also the same article

82
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:34,680
where they're like they when they followed him around. They were like when

83
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:37,160
he goes into the recording booth. He doesn't write any of his lyrics down. He

84
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:38,440
draws pictures yeah,

85
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:45,200
years, like he would look at this picture of white Goku that Patrick made and he

86
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:47,600
might say something about some fruit.

87
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:48,600
White Goku.

88
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:49,600
No, I'm guessing the picture.

89
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:50,600
I feel like white Goku.

90
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:51,600
Because how do you draw?

91
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,600
I'm in your city, call it Roku.

92
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:56,600
Oh shit, wait, that was actually nice.

93
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:59,600
Roku city when the Goku hit me.

94
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:00,600
Godzilla.

95
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:01,600
Godzilla.

96
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:02,600
Godzilla.

97
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:03,600
Watching ThrillerCon.

98
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:04,600
He wouldn't say that.

99
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:05,600
Watching Thriller on YouTube.

100
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:06,600
He wouldn't say that.

101
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:07,600
You know I'm in a bad mood.

102
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:08,600
He has to be mad disrespectful.

103
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:12,520
Why do you think you can come in here in the middle of the episode and defend a

104
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:14,760
rapper? When you normally won't even answer a question.

105
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:17,960
Right. Well, because we asked him questions and then you don't say anything.

106
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:19,800
We pissed him the fuck off by saying something rude. That's disrespectful.

107
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:25,800
See, he's got to defend his man. Wait, are you YSL? He is. Yeah. Oh my God.

108
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:28,600
So are you in trouble right now? Yeah. Shouldn't you be in some kind of...

109
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:34,040
Yeah, 100%. Yeah. Oh shit. I guess that makes some sense. Yeah, I would love to

110
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:39,840
be eclectic, but I just don't have it in me. No, you mean eccentric. Yeah, yeah, I

111
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:42,720
would love to be eccentric, but I just don't have it. I mean, maybe that's kind

112
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:46,320
of one of my only time you're dressed eclectically right now. Some people,

113
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:52,280
some people would think that I mean, if you're trying to be eccentric, right? If

114
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:55,960
I don't think eccentric people know they're eccentric, do I look like I sell

115
00:05:55,960 --> 00:06:00,280
most eccentric people really know they're eccentric and really are kind of

116
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:05,080
of milking it. Yeah, I do. We're their cat. I glasses, dude. These people who

117
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:09,080
do these house tours, yeah, where they're walking around their houses,

118
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:13,240
forty five different fucking colors and they have like you'll see animals

119
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:16,140
everywhere. Shut up. You'll be walking around, especially in New York. You'll

120
00:06:16,140 --> 00:06:19,000
be like walking around. You'll see some guy. It's like, okay, buddy, I get it.

121
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,280
You got you got the long beard. You got the ragged clothes. You're walking

122
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:28,280
around like, yes, dude. Oh, I'm tired of these eccentrics. These eccentric

123
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:32,000
hipsters in Brooklyn. I hate these eccentric hipsters. They walk around

124
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,880
instead of a shirt, they're wearing a big drum instead of shoes, they're

125
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:39,760
wearing two pedals instead of lipstick, they have a harmonica and then instead

126
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:43,760
of just normal gloves, they have two trombones. Some of them are golden men.

127
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:47,520
I'm tired. What is? Yeah, exactly. The hipsters who walk around as gold. Oh,

128
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:50,760
wait, I'm gold. Yeah, wait. Oh, look at me. I made a silver and I don't

129
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:54,040
move at all. Yeah. What the fuck are you doing? I just sit here and

130
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:57,400
then somebody tries to touch me and I stand up. That's when I stand up.

131
00:06:57,400 --> 00:07:02,100
Oh, I think moving and being a normal color is mainstream, so I will do this

132
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:06,100
because I'll be completely silver. I will be a silver unmoving hipster and

133
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:10,100
then when they do move it's like hey, what are you moving at twelve frames

134
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:12,000
for twelve frames per second?

135
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,900
What do you even do you're doing? You know what other you know what other

136
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:19,500
eccentric hipsters I hate what like like oh look at me. I'm wearing a polo

137
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:23,500
shirt with a with a golden M on and I stand behind this counter. Oh, don't

138
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:27,200
even get me back here. I'm on the other side of this counter from you. Yeah,

139
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:31,840
I come over this everybody who's main stream sits on that side, but I sit on

140
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:33,960
the behind side of the food rest.

141
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:36,760
I'm so

142
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:42,320
a hipster. I sit behind the cash register and set up in front of it and

143
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:45,560
I get to press the button and I don't even love pressing the but I don't even

144
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:49,680
order the food. I don't even food is to mainstream. You order the food. I'm too

145
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:53,800
cool to order food. I stand there and listen to you with no expression while

146
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:58,720
the order yours and then I'll say, okay, okay, yeah, sure, that'll be right out.

147
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:01,400
Yeah, sure, I'll get that for you. What kind of soda?

148
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:05,640
That is so fucking hipster. They say, "And what kind of soda?" They're so obsessed

149
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:08,980
with fucking being taste makers and trendsetters that they're literally always

150
00:08:08,980 --> 00:08:11,720
asking people, "What kind of soda do you want? What food are you gonna eat?"

151
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:15,000
It's like, "Chill out. Just think about yourself. It doesn't matter what I

152
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,920
like or I'm gonna get." 'Cause you know what they're gonna say? Do you wanna

153
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:20,160
make that a large for an extra 60 cents? What does that mean,

154
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:22,400
you freaking hipster? You know what they're gonna say if you say, "I like

155
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:26,600
They're gonna go like, "Well, Coke's okay, but I just don't like the fan base of Coke."

156
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:27,600
Exactly.

157
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:30,520
"I just don't like the fan base of Sprite."

158
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:33,200
Let's not get ahead of ourselves here.

159
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:34,240
Let's not get into that.

160
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:35,240
Let's not get into sodas.

161
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:36,240
What?

162
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:38,200
Let's not talk about sodas.

163
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:39,920
I'm tired of talking about it.

164
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:40,920
Why?

165
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:41,920
What?

166
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:42,920
I'm tired of it all week.

167
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:44,960
Everyone's like, "You have to promote sodas.

168
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:46,800
Oh, you played Faygo."

169
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:47,800
I'm done.

170
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:48,800
I'm done.

171
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:50,880
In the E1 original production?

172
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:51,880
They keep Charles.

173
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:58,880
Charles is a fucking monster. He keeps berating me.

174
00:08:58,880 --> 00:08:59,880
He's berating me.

175
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:00,880
He kind of just steamrolled our whole hipster thing.

176
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:02,880
We had a really, that was probably the best thing we've had.

177
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:04,880
We were like right on the precipice.

178
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:05,880
We were not on the precipice.

179
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:09,880
That's true. We were on a breakneck downhill sleigh ride. It was incredible.

180
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:12,880
It was North Pole, Grinch, Hart Grove.

181
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:14,880
I'm sorry. I'm going through a lot this week.

182
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:16,880
We were on our way to a finale.

183
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:18,880
I am going through a fucking lot this week.

184
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:20,880
We were on our way to a jet plane pentagon finale on our Grinch sleigh.

185
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:25,480
but this was about to be like the thing that popped for us. We were popping. We

186
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:29,460
were popping and we were hitting top forty and you just fucking say you don't

187
00:09:29,460 --> 00:09:33,000
talk about sodas because I did a podcast this week. I got to

188
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:39,460
I had to use my stress toy. This is your stress toy. I dismembered a dismembered

189
00:09:39,460 --> 00:09:39,800
arm.

190
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:45,440
I want to dismember your member. I don't want to dismember this at all. No, no,

191
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:48,940
no, no, no, I don't want to remember. This is something I never need to member

192
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:53,760
again. Speaking of man, these member berries are funny as fuck. I've been getting back

193
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:58,400
into the member berries. These member berries are amazing. I love them. I wish they kept

194
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:02,160
going with the member berries. Where did they go? They just did them for like two seasons.

195
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:06,560
But guys, bring these member berries back and they can go. Member. So if they're off

196
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:11,540
the show, if they're off of South Park, can we have them here? What? So they're off of

197
00:10:11,540 --> 00:10:15,440
South Park now. Oh, in fact, they're walking in right now. Yeah. Can you, Jubio, just get

198
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:19,800
like a PNG of the member berries and just put it right here. Could you just edit

199
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:23,640
away the background of like 50 member berries real quick? Yeah, and just put

200
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:25,740
all the member berries right in front of the table. Scatter them all around the

201
00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:29,920
entire screen. Make them animated. If you can animate them, and preferably in

202
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:34,360
three dimensions. Yeah. Here we go. Okay, we got a PNG of the member berries.

203
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:38,280
Okay. Yeah, so the member berries, they're in studio. Yeah. They're about

204
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:42,440
to be here very, very soon. Don't save it as an HTML. He's just trying his

205
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:47,880
artist. It's a way. I don't know if that'll if that'll work. Let's see if we

206
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:51,200
can get a different file here. Yeah, let's get a new type of fun. Maybe you

207
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:54,440
got to get like a P and JPEG is not going to be good. JPEG is not a loss.

208
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:57,200
It's okay. It doesn't need to be lost. It needs to be transparent, though.

209
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:02,680
Fine with loss. You're fine with loss. I deal with loss. It's a part of human

210
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:07,600
life and when listen, when you when you lose loss, you become something like a

211
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:12,900
necromancer. I hate loss. I agree, man. That's honestly that leads you down a

212
00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:17,700
path not that far away from being hit. Fuck loss and fuck grief. If you're

213
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:22,280
grieving right now, if you're grieving, fuck you. Alright, Charlie, Chuckie,

214
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:26,720
Chuckie Brown. He says good grief. He likes grief. He thinks it's good. He

215
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:29,700
doesn't like... He says good grief sarcastically. Yeah, 'cause he... I mean,

216
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:34,600
I will admit that he wallows. He said... Yeah. He goes, "Oh, good grief." I

217
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:35,600
I thought he likes it.

218
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:37,600
No, he doesn't like grief, you fucking asshole.

219
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:38,600
He's grieving.

220
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:40,600
He's grieving when he says it.

221
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:44,600
No, he's wallowing in misery.

222
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:45,600
Yeah.

223
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:46,600
He likes it.

224
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:48,600
He's calling it good.

225
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:49,600
Which sin would he be?

226
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:51,600
Did you see this video?

227
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:52,600
It's not a sin.

228
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:57,600
This video of these two Filipino guys with a podcast, and they're sitting there, and

229
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:02,600
he's like, "Did you know that all of the holidays equal every single one of the seven deadly

230
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:03,600
deadly sins.

231
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:09,580
What was their argument for that? Their argument was Valentine's Day is lust.

232
00:12:09,580 --> 00:12:15,880
Christmas is greed. Thanksgiving is gluttony. St. Patrick's Day is

233
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:18,160
sloth.

234
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:28,680
You got wrath left. You got envy and you got pride. Wrath is angry day. Pride is

235
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:30,440
fourth of July July

236
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:35,700
envy envy is also valentine's day

237
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:41,320
also. No, it would be Christmas. I don't even know that was really, but it can be

238
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:44,880
both yeah yeah. Well, then why can't valentine's day? Two things can be true

239
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:47,960
at the same time. My friend, I honestly think there's space for every sin on

240
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:52,000
every holiday. Yeah, well, you know what about you know what? Let's make some

241
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:56,180
more since wait. I mean yeah. Well, the argument is how we seven deadly ones

242
00:12:56,180 --> 00:12:57,640
right seven deadly sins

243
00:12:58,640 --> 00:13:00,640
Buddy, let's add seven more.

244
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:02,640
Okay, where would you start with that?

245
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:06,640
Okay, so the seven more deadly sins.

246
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:07,640
Deadlier?

247
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:08,640
Deadlier sins.

248
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:09,640
Which would be?

249
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:10,640
For the modern era.

250
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:12,640
Okay.

251
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:13,640
Being...

252
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:14,640
Being?

253
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:16,640
Being a hipster.

254
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:18,640
Being a hipster? Okay.

255
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:19,640
Go back to the center.

256
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:21,640
We're already way past that.

257
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:24,640
You're the one who Matrix yanked us out of that.

258
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:26,640
Matrix yanking?

259
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:33,080
number two. No, that's a sin. I was the matrix Yankee. I was falling asleep the

260
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:36,300
other night falling asleep. Wait, actually, I was doing that as well. Twin

261
00:13:36,300 --> 00:13:41,280
my twin, that's me and my twin in him. I was falling asleep the other night and I

262
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:45,520
was thinking about how good it probably feels to be in some kind of alien goo

263
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:50,000
farm. Yeah, be like sliding down a very long tube forever. I was like I think

264
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:54,000
that I would actually really enjoy you. You're thinking of gun. If I was

265
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:58,140
abducted and want to be gunged well, but I want to be controlled by a higher

266
00:13:58,140 --> 00:14:02,400
being in the gun. You want to get an avi positive or egg in you yeah, so if I

267
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:05,960
was like if I said you woke up and I was being abducted and I was sliding

268
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:09,760
through a tube into a UFO. I really think I would enjoy that feeling. I

269
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:12,360
feel like it would be very comforting. Did you guys like to see that movie

270
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:16,840
fire in the sky? No, that was you should watch them. That's a good movie with

271
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:20,840
the it has the it's the alien abduction scene where they're like doing they put

272
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:24,860
milk in the guy's mouth. They put milk in it. Dude, I would just drink it.

273
00:14:24,860 --> 00:14:27,860
How are you talking about bro? It's something like that's similar to that,

274
00:14:27,860 --> 00:14:31,760
but it's good. So this is a movie you made up. Yeah, it's really it's a

275
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:36,780
nasty alien. I just think that you should you'd like that scene. Can you

276
00:14:36,780 --> 00:14:40,060
roll that clip? No, we don't need to see this clip. I don't see it, but he

277
00:14:40,060 --> 00:14:43,320
didn't watch the clip on your own time. But anyway, yeah, I just think that

278
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:48,260
that a lot everyone says that's the most horrifically horrible abduction scene,

279
00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:51,700
I think it could feel pretty good to have a little fire all over your face.

280
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:54,300
Basically, nobody. Yeah, empty movie with no one.

281
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:59,000
That is a good idea. Actually, it's a pretty boring movie, except for the one

282
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,900
part where they're in an alien spaceship and there's no gravity. So they're like

283
00:15:01,900 --> 00:15:05,300
jumping around and flying around and they get getting surgeried. I just

284
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:09,000
realized how to end this whole actors writers strike guys. Yeah, movie with

285
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:14,200
nobody in it. And completely empty movie with nobody in it and just keeps

286
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:17,100
changing scenes. Just different pictures. That's called a documentary.

287
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:20,140
No, no, no. It would be like pictures of... So you can't have actors, so it would be pictures

288
00:15:20,140 --> 00:15:21,840
of like animals walking around.

289
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:22,840
Right, a document.

290
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:23,840
But isn't it...

291
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:27,000
Close-ups about them like mating and stuff, and it would be like a movie with nobody in

292
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000
it.

293
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,900
Is it the producer strike or the people are striking against producers because then that's

294
00:15:31,900 --> 00:15:34,720
a movie that would be made by producers?

295
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:36,140
That's what I mean is they can just keep making movies.

296
00:15:36,140 --> 00:15:38,300
Right, no, I don't think the producers are on strike right now.

297
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:39,300
Wait, why...

298
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:40,300
Yeah, that's what I'm saying.

299
00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:42,880
How come these animals aren't going on strike? That's actually a really good point. And these

300
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:46,460
nature doc... Because they can... Everybody likes nature documentaries. They do very well.

301
00:15:46,460 --> 00:15:48,700
They could do a March of the Penguins right now.

302
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:50,620
Also, why aren't the directors on strike?

303
00:15:50,620 --> 00:15:51,620
They have a whole group.

304
00:15:51,620 --> 00:15:52,620
Isn't every guild on strike right now?

305
00:15:52,620 --> 00:15:55,620
Isn't everybody that has music videos to make?

306
00:15:55,620 --> 00:15:56,620
What?

307
00:15:56,620 --> 00:15:57,620
Isn't every guild on strike?

308
00:15:57,620 --> 00:15:59,180
I think it's just the actors and the writers.

309
00:15:59,180 --> 00:16:01,180
I think the directors get to do whatever they want.

310
00:16:01,180 --> 00:16:03,820
You know what guild I think should go on strike?

311
00:16:03,820 --> 00:16:04,820
The Thieves Guild.

312
00:16:04,820 --> 00:16:05,820
Yeah.

313
00:16:05,820 --> 00:16:08,740
Stop pig-pocketing me just because I'm walking through the village, man.

314
00:16:08,740 --> 00:16:09,740
You're stealing out of my barrel.

315
00:16:09,740 --> 00:16:11,780
You've got to get that Italian lady to follow you around.

316
00:16:11,780 --> 00:16:13,260
You're stealing out of my fucking barrel.

317
00:16:13,260 --> 00:16:14,260
Leave my barrel alone.

318
00:16:14,260 --> 00:16:15,260
You seen this lady?

319
00:16:15,260 --> 00:16:20,260
coins on top of that. Who? Attencion pickpocket. No. Have you seen her? No. This little Italian

320
00:16:20,260 --> 00:16:31,620
lady runs around Italy and just like. How little? Screams. She's like. Stop. She's that

321
00:16:31,620 --> 00:16:37,820
small? That small. How many feet is that? She runs up to people and just screams. Attencion

322
00:16:37,820 --> 00:16:44,020
pickpocket. She runs up to people. She runs up to active pickpockets. Oh. And she stops

323
00:16:44,020 --> 00:16:47,700
them and films them with her phone. I think that I would be a pretty decent pickpocket.

324
00:16:47,700 --> 00:16:54,740
Yeah? Well, I can feel you in my pocket right now. That actually sounded so fucking sexual.

325
00:16:54,740 --> 00:17:01,100
I can feel you in my pocket right now. What are you doing? Leave me alone. He just touched

326
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:05,020
my dick. I didn't touch his dick. He literally just reached down and reached in between my

327
00:17:05,020 --> 00:17:10,420
legs. Stop! Okay, I can't even attempt to pickpocket? Do you guys feel like we are penis

328
00:17:10,420 --> 00:17:13,920
penis friends penis for like well. You guys have seen my penis.

329
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:20,660
Okay, I know what I mean. I know what you mean like I went to the I went to I

330
00:17:20,660 --> 00:17:23,600
know exactly no. I do know I went to the bathhouse last night. I think we're

331
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:27,760
really where I think we honestly have been for years and years been completely

332
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:31,820
teetering on the precipice. Well, I broke the seal. I broke the seal on the show.

333
00:17:31,820 --> 00:17:36,220
Yeah, that was three years in. You showed us. You don't even remember this.

334
00:17:36,220 --> 00:17:39,880
You don't remember. I showed you the photo picture of his penis in his hand.

335
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:43,100
so that was like not really. It wasn't what are you talking about? There's also

336
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:45,220
a picture that was all of my penis.

337
00:17:45,220 --> 00:17:50,940
What do you mean that was that was my whole thing like nothing there, you

338
00:17:50,940 --> 00:17:55,460
know yeah, it's just kind of boring, but I went I went to the bath house with

339
00:17:55,460 --> 00:18:01,060
somebody last night, a friend of mine and I got it was Brian. I got change in

340
00:18:01,060 --> 00:18:03,900
the locker room because I was like we're penis friends. I can look at my penis on

341
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:06,940
a he's not going to look, but he can be around my yeah, he's not going to yeah.

342
00:18:07,060 --> 00:18:09,700
he can smell it. Of course, it's a locker room. Everybody's penis friends in a

343
00:18:09,700 --> 00:18:13,020
locker room. He can feel the aura. Yeah. But then... Yeah, that's penis partners.

344
00:18:13,020 --> 00:18:15,860
That's like penis business partners. It's not even friends. Yeah, that's like...

345
00:18:15,860 --> 00:18:18,620
That's... If you're in a locker room... A fellow commuter. That's like you're

346
00:18:18,620 --> 00:18:21,020
riding... That's the guy you ride the train next to every day. Yeah, exactly.

347
00:18:21,020 --> 00:18:23,820
You can show him your penis on the train. I have seen...

348
00:18:23,820 --> 00:18:30,140
I have seen some really, really big ones recently at movie theater urinals and

349
00:18:30,140 --> 00:18:33,180
also at locker rooms. Oh, yeah, movie theaters. Movie theater urinals? There's

350
00:18:33,180 --> 00:18:37,180
the movie theater downtown where the urinals are really, really close to each

351
00:18:37,180 --> 00:18:40,620
other. I went in there and saw bottoms. They're really, really close to each

352
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:42,380
other. No, buddy, you saw fronts. And there's a

353
00:18:42,380 --> 00:18:46,740
I saw many fronts, and I was sandwiched between, and there's no way you always

354
00:18:46,740 --> 00:18:50,300
have to look at the guy's penis, because you're right, it's way too close, and

355
00:18:50,300 --> 00:18:53,740
there's no divider. You can look forward. But my peripheral vision is picking up

356
00:18:53,740 --> 00:18:57,540
information. Yeah. Right. I'm not, I do not have a cone. You need blinkers like

357
00:18:57,540 --> 00:19:01,700
a horse. I need a dog cone, blinders. Yeah. Blinders. Blinkers.

358
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:03,500
they make

359
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:09,000
you should have done what me and Caleb did and had two different coffees and

360
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:12,320
energy drinks, but I was sitting there next to so little coffee this morning,

361
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:14,040
because I didn't feel like making it. I was saying

362
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:18,560
opened up next door. I was sandwiched between the biggest penis I've ever seen,

363
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:21,280
the smallest penis I've ever seen at that. I'm between the biggest and

364
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:24,140
smallest, and I was like this is nice, because this is me. I'm that means that

365
00:19:24,140 --> 00:19:28,000
I'm medium, but I got my got my penis sandwiched between the biggest ball ever

366
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,440
seen the smallest ball I ever seen.

367
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:30,440
damn

368
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:35,800
one big one, one small one and they're sandwiched right now. My balls have

369
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:39,800
stopped growing. Yeah, finally mine stopped growing. I was like I think mine

370
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:43,360
got smaller. I think mine. I've also gotten smaller recently. Yeah, I think

371
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:46,680
it's maybe it's the weather. It's all them drinks. You guys are drinking right

372
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:51,240
now. Yeah, it's I put once I get when I get my first kidney stone strength, your

373
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:56,360
balls. Yeah, my first kidney stone is going to be like so horrifying,

374
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:59,400
especially you know that it'll be the first of many. Yeah.

375
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:04,040
Oh, you probably have one. You've probably had one for a long time.

376
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:06,920
You probably have a fully calcified kidney. I think I've passed a kidney

377
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:10,800
stone before. No, you know, no, no. You don't do that and not know.

378
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:14,680
There is a time... It hurts badly. There was a time where I went pee and

379
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:18,400
it hurt after. My cousin did that and it changed. It probably doesn't hurt

380
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:22,040
after. It hurt during. I feel like it probably hurts during and then you see

381
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:25,200
a stone. During and after. I didn't see a stone. Yeah. It probably hurts so

382
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:29,880
maybe the stone went back in have a lot of trouble. Yeah, my penis has been

383
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:33,920
hurting at random intervals. Recently, I've had pain in different parts of my

384
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:38,440
penis before. Yeah, yeah, due to different. I think it's somewhat normal.

385
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:41,600
Yeah, I think it's normal to have basically any type of stabbing pain

386
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:46,200
anywhere in your body for two to three weeks. Yeah, yeah, any longer than that

387
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:50,240
and you should probably see a telehealth professional. Yeah, you might want to go

388
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:53,360
to an urgent care where they don't take your insurance and then go home. Yeah,

389
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:56,860
and you walk in, you say, I don't have any insurance, but I need you to look at my

390
00:20:56,860 --> 00:21:01,120
penis right now. You go in screaming, you throw you what you do is you throw your

391
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:06,800
ID in a plate like in a in a lock box that you have with you, throw the ID in

392
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:10,800
the lock box outside of it so that no one can get in, no one can break into it

393
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:14,560
and then you walk in and you say you just start screaming. So they have to

394
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:20,040
take you in as a John Doe. Oh, I see. Oh, why not just leave your ID at home? Why

395
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:22,480
do you have to put in a lock box and throw it out? Do you think they might

396
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:26,460
I notice you're throwing a lock box outside. No, no, no, no, they would not

397
00:21:26,460 --> 00:21:29,840
investigate this. You go and pick up the lock box and take it. Why not just

398
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:33,140
leave? Well, if they pick up the lock box and take it, there's also an air

399
00:21:33,140 --> 00:21:33,800
tag in it,

400
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:37,100
so you can go to their house. Get it. You know what you know what you can find

401
00:21:37,100 --> 00:21:41,640
even easier than an air tag your house. I think that's all up for debate. Your

402
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:43,680
address. I think it's all up for debate, dude.

403
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:47,960
I'm going to air tag at my house. Do you think they would take me at the er if I

404
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:50,760
walked in and told and just said I'm going to just hold my breath. If you

405
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:51,320
don't take me

406
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:56,360
My little brother used to do that. Yeah, I wouldn't get its way. It's a kid. That

407
00:21:56,360 --> 00:21:56,680
I mean,

408
00:21:56,680 --> 00:22:01,400
that's what I'll do. I'll say I have a scab and I'm going to hold my breath

409
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:02,580
until you cover it with something

410
00:22:02,580 --> 00:22:08,620
and they're going to go really funny, very funny. Okay, stop holding your

411
00:22:08,620 --> 00:22:10,580
breath. Okay, stop holding your breath.

412
00:22:10,580 --> 00:22:15,120
Admit this man right now. Yeah, I think that's how it would go. What you have

413
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:18,040
to do is you have a if you have a minor injury that you don't think they're

414
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:18,360
going to

415
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:22,320
push you up to the front of the line at the ER for you just have to break your

416
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:24,240
arm or your neck or something also.

417
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:27,800
You should just you got a sore throat, you want to get seen immediately, you

418
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:31,780
just kind of, oh, you won't take me? Yeah, exactly. How about now? I'll kill

419
00:22:31,780 --> 00:22:35,600
myself. How about now? I'll fucking kill myself if you don't take me. You got to

420
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:40,320
walk in with, you got to slit your whole chest open. You know what you got to do.

421
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:43,280
Your heart's beating out and you walk in and you say, I need to be seen right

422
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:46,040
now, I have a sore throat. It's so annoying. And also, please can you close

423
00:22:46,060 --> 00:22:50,300
shut us up. The health care industry in this country is so annoying because the

424
00:22:50,300 --> 00:22:54,020
only way to get into these fucking ERs and these urgent cares, you gotta pull up

425
00:22:54,020 --> 00:22:57,900
with a squad of, like, fine ass women and you gotta,

426
00:22:57,900 --> 00:23:02,060
you gotta pull up in your best, you gotta be wearing, you gotta be wearing

427
00:23:02,060 --> 00:23:05,980
Amiri jeans and, like, a Gucci shirt and you gotta be-,

428
00:23:05,980 --> 00:23:10,940
you're standing in line, like, they're not gonna, they're not gonna pull you in-,

429
00:23:10,940 --> 00:23:12,460
they ain't even gonna look at you if you walk in. They're not gonna pull you in

430
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:16,840
is your 10 deep with a squad of finance Instagram feed. If you pull up in the

431
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:20,280
faded glory, they're going to turn you around the door. They are not putting

432
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:24,680
you. You got no boundaries on bro. You got no boundaries on diamond supply.

433
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:29,040
Co. You got my diamond supply. Go. They will bring you in bro. Diamond supply.

434
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:32,320
Co. You think they will? I forgot about diamonds. I was singing the other day.

435
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:36,120
I saw a kid wearing that the other day. I was like, holy shit. Me and Neil

436
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:42,000
really wanted to buy like full diamond supply. Co. Young and reckless fits for

437
00:23:42,020 --> 00:23:46,820
are that college show we did. That would have been so sick, dude. You're wearing like the

438
00:23:46,820 --> 00:23:50,580
diamond supply coatees, the ones that had like the little tag right there. I looked on

439
00:23:50,580 --> 00:23:53,860
eBay and I searched young and reckless shirts and it was a bunch of things that were like

440
00:23:53,860 --> 00:24:01,380
$75 vintage 2015 young and reckless t-shirts. Dude, it's so funny. So awesome. Like the

441
00:24:01,380 --> 00:24:06,660
reseller market is so stupid right now. It's going to like, once this recession fully hits,

442
00:24:06,660 --> 00:24:09,740
it's going to be so funny. I don't think it's going to hit, man. You think it's just going

443
00:24:09,740 --> 00:24:13,420
of bubbles going to keep growing and growing. I don't believe in bubbles. I'm not a child.

444
00:24:13,420 --> 00:24:17,620
I think we're entering a golden age of prosperity. Interesting. Why does everything have to be

445
00:24:17,620 --> 00:24:21,700
a bubble, man? Everyone's prospering and buying. When I close my eyes at night to go to sleep,

446
00:24:21,700 --> 00:24:26,180
my soul flies high above my body and I can see this country and the world as if I'm playing

447
00:24:26,180 --> 00:24:29,840
civilization. And it's all going all right. And I'm moving everything around for everybody.

448
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:34,820
Everything's all night long. Full green bars all around. The economy will be saved from

449
00:24:34,820 --> 00:24:39,260
from putting it. I'm the economy will be saved from putting the word vintage

450
00:24:39,260 --> 00:24:40,260
zoomies shirt,

451
00:24:40,260 --> 00:24:48,100
VTG zoomies, two thousand and seventeen golf Wang. Yes, yeah, oh damn, I should

452
00:24:48,100 --> 00:24:52,860
sell my vintage golf Wang shirts. Yeah, should do you have any? I think I don't

453
00:24:52,860 --> 00:24:56,140
know if I had one yeah. I don't know what happened to it. I definitely don't

454
00:24:56,140 --> 00:24:59,820
have the ones from twenty twelve actually would. So those would do pretty

455
00:24:59,820 --> 00:25:04,260
well. I should check. Maybe it's at my dad's. I my girlfriend had one that had

456
00:25:04,300 --> 00:25:09,500
My girlfriend has the, uh, the fucking from the, the shoes, like the golf

457
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:11,900
left floors that she never, she wore like one time.

458
00:25:11,900 --> 00:25:13,500
Those would sell pretty well.

459
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:18,600
And then she also has like the corniest, like, it's like the golf

460
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:20,300
wing, like Trump Hitler shirt.

461
00:25:20,300 --> 00:25:25,300
You guys think I could make you guys think I can make any money selling

462
00:25:25,300 --> 00:25:27,300
my, uh, my five finger death punch shirt.

463
00:25:27,300 --> 00:25:28,800
Yeah, actually, definitely.

464
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:31,700
You actually, dude, I don't know if I have that one either.

465
00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:32,200
Yeah.

466
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:37,840
These kids, these kids nowadays, it's so fun. You see like kids wearing Jenko's and stuff

467
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:41,720
and like they're all wearing like the vintage Y2K shit. You can sell like a Slipknot shirt

468
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:45,640
for like probably like seven, depending on when it was from, you could probably sell

469
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:51,960
for like 75. Yeah. And all the, I'd see everyone always selling and buying all the Deftones

470
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:58,600
stuff too. Yeah. The Deftones shit is insane. Basically styling. I want to live in a world

471
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:02,760
where the most coolest and most expensive shirt is a white t-shirt. It is actually.

472
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:08,680
It still is. It can't beat a classic. It's called an APC, man. I want to be buying vintage white t-shirts.

473
00:26:08,680 --> 00:26:15,560
I think that basically style and clothing is almost cyclical in nature.

474
00:26:15,560 --> 00:26:20,280
Yeah, they almost have a relationship between each other where it's like this, like interlocking fingers.

475
00:26:20,280 --> 00:26:25,480
Yeah, where I feel like stuff that used to be cool and then wasn't, it almost

476
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:31,080
comes back and it's cool again. Yeah, retro. Yeah. So like completely vintage. It's like

477
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:36,640
video games. It's like how Pac-Man came back into Smash Brothers. Pac-Man was my nephew's

478
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:42,080
favorite video game character for like too long. And then the Mario movie came out and

479
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:45,640
he moved on to that. But he was telling me stuff about Pac-Man I think I've never heard

480
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:51,480
in my life. There's a Pac-Man enemy. In five years, everybody's going to be rocking full

481
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:56,480
asbestos suits just covered in asbestos, breathing the shit out of it.

482
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:58,480
And asbestos in the middle of the summer.

483
00:26:58,480 --> 00:26:59,480
We're not going retro.

484
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:04,480
BPA is coming back, guys. Get yourself a hot-ass plastic water bottle.

485
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:09,480
Leave your water bottle in the car, drink the plastic that comes, that melts out.

486
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:14,480
When are we going to be opening Depop and starting to see the listings pop up?

487
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:18,480
Vintage breastplate, vintage queer ass, vintage claditorial helmet.

488
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:19,480
Vintage queer ass?

489
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:21,480
They already got that on e-pop, man.

490
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:23,480
They got that in spades.

491
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:25,480
Vintage chain mail.

492
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:27,480
When are we going? When is the retro?

493
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:29,480
You can buy chain mail in there.

494
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:31,480
I've actually seen some people wearing chain mail.

495
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:33,480
I've definitely also seen people wearing chain mail.

496
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:35,480
Okay, then what about samurai outfits?

497
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:37,480
You know what else I saw? I saw people wearing chain mail.

498
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:39,480
I also saw people riding horses.

499
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:41,480
Yeah, what if someone pulls up...

500
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:43,480
Dude, what if in ten years somebody pulls up on you,

501
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:45,480
right, and they say, "What's up, what's up? Check it out.

502
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:47,480
I got the wheel on me."

503
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:53,180
a wheel one big wheel and yeah, big made of rock wheel and they're going to

504
00:27:53,180 --> 00:27:59,000
our side. Check this shit out. Check this new wave. I'm on and they make a

505
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:02,680
fire right in front of you. If he was still alive right now, still love.

506
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:06,000
What if somebody pulls up with the aqueduct?

507
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:09,720
Oh my God, you got the aqueduct.

508
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:11,400
He got the

509
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:20,880
he got the wood and he pulled up with a whole last aqua duck. He got the

510
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:27,000
sundial on his wrist. Damn son damn you nice for that gag from Amish paradise

511
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:31,080
when he got the sundial on the wrist. Well, that's why Amish people are this.

512
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:34,960
Oh my God, they don't go far back enough, though, but I'm just people are

513
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:39,600
pulling up. They're saying check out the the four sided barn. We just raised.

514
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:45,280
he goes, damn checkers, new carriage, it's got two horse power. Oh, my God, he got

515
00:28:45,280 --> 00:28:51,500
the two horse power buggy dude, God damn dude, you see, you see the Amish dudes

516
00:28:51,500 --> 00:28:57,020
right, you you're like scoping out a like group of Amish people right, imagine

517
00:28:57,020 --> 00:29:00,280
this, you're looking like you know how you see him at the bus. Sometimes you

518
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:03,220
see like the big Amish families, you'd be better not to be getting on that bus

519
00:29:03,220 --> 00:29:07,360
boy. I know, I know you're not allowed, but you see like a group of Amish people

520
00:29:07,380 --> 00:29:12,540
right? You're like like like six of them lined up, six of them lined up, one of

521
00:29:12,540 --> 00:29:17,400
them, one of them is just wearing that rogue status to rob dear deck all over

522
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:22,920
gun print shirt. That'd be so sick. It's just like well, I've actually held to

523
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:23,140
get

524
00:29:23,140 --> 00:29:28,320
spreading hype beastism in the Amish community like smallpox. Yeah,

525
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:28,900
giving them

526
00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:31,620
do Amish people

527
00:29:34,140 --> 00:29:39,520
Do Amish people have to be always 200 years behind or are they going to stay there forever?

528
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:40,520
I think they stay there forever.

529
00:29:40,520 --> 00:29:41,520
I think they stay there.

530
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:45,020
So in 200 years they won't be watching Spongebob season one?

531
00:29:45,020 --> 00:29:46,460
Maybe, maybe they just jump ahead.

532
00:29:46,460 --> 00:29:50,300
They'll probably still be reading books about Spongebob like they do now.

533
00:29:50,300 --> 00:29:53,620
Reading the novelizations of episodes.

534
00:29:53,620 --> 00:29:54,620
Yeah that is sad as fuck.

535
00:29:54,620 --> 00:29:55,620
They'll read the screenplays.

536
00:29:55,620 --> 00:29:58,620
They have to read Fall of Reach instead of play Halo.

537
00:29:58,620 --> 00:29:59,620
Yeah.

538
00:29:59,620 --> 00:30:00,620
That's actually sad.

539
00:30:00,620 --> 00:30:07,620
I've seen an Amish dude, he had to draw a succession. He had to draw Kendall Roy.

540
00:30:07,620 --> 00:30:08,620
Really?

541
00:30:08,620 --> 00:30:12,120
Yeah, with like a piece of burnt thistle or something.

542
00:30:12,120 --> 00:30:13,120
With the thistle?

543
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:16,620
With the burnt thistle, he had to draw it. Because he doesn't have a pencil.

544
00:30:16,620 --> 00:30:18,620
They don't even have a pen with an ink reservoir?

545
00:30:18,620 --> 00:30:19,620
No, no, no.

546
00:30:19,620 --> 00:30:20,620
They have a quill.

547
00:30:20,620 --> 00:30:21,620
I want to use one of these pens.

548
00:30:21,620 --> 00:30:22,620
They don't even have a quill.

549
00:30:22,620 --> 00:30:23,620
They have quills, man.

550
00:30:23,620 --> 00:30:24,620
No.

551
00:30:24,620 --> 00:30:25,620
What kind of quill do you want to use?

552
00:30:25,620 --> 00:30:26,620
No.

553
00:30:26,620 --> 00:30:27,620
One of the big dippers.

554
00:30:27,620 --> 00:30:28,620
I had one of those.

555
00:30:28,620 --> 00:30:29,620
Was it amazing?

556
00:30:29,620 --> 00:30:36,180
fire. Oh yeah. I feel like Slytherin. I felt so cool with the nib. Yeah. I did my

557
00:30:36,180 --> 00:30:40,660
art teacher in high school. She let me use those because she said my pen and ink

558
00:30:40,660 --> 00:30:46,180
drawings were good. That was one of the goaded things to be autistic about.

559
00:30:46,180 --> 00:30:50,180
Dude, learning the crosshatch. Learning the pen and ink drawing with a nib. Oh yeah.

560
00:30:50,180 --> 00:30:53,220
Wow. You're learning the different pressures you got to put on it to draw

561
00:30:53,220 --> 00:30:56,420
certain lines. Oh my god. Oh I missed that. I need to get, we need to get that.

562
00:30:56,420 --> 00:31:01,180
should get some some I would love to get that big calligraphy writing set pill

563
00:31:01,180 --> 00:31:09,300
shaped pens nib to me is a some kind of bite size pretzel buddy buddy but that's

564
00:31:09,300 --> 00:31:13,300
just my that's just my American way you're thinking of a nibble that's just

565
00:31:13,300 --> 00:31:18,140
my fucking American way nib is a type of pen tip. I think I might be willing to

566
00:31:18,140 --> 00:31:21,460
get into art recently. I started playing a Japanese video game and I think I'm

567
00:31:21,460 --> 00:31:25,580
becoming obsessed with Japan. That's one of the number one games to make you

568
00:31:25,580 --> 00:31:27,580
you're obsessed with Japan. Yes, I

569
00:31:27,580 --> 00:31:32,060
walked in. You can literally like I feel like that is the that's the like kind of

570
00:31:32,060 --> 00:31:32,380
like

571
00:31:32,380 --> 00:31:37,300
you know, like in a video game where they have the level save code and you like

572
00:31:37,300 --> 00:31:39,740
the old video games, you enter the password and it like puts you right in

573
00:31:39,740 --> 00:31:42,660
that save state. That's like playing that game is like that's your brain code

574
00:31:42,660 --> 00:31:47,220
where you can like kind of like retroactively create a high school era of

575
00:31:47,220 --> 00:31:51,260
weebism just by playing Persona. It's kind of what's happening to me. I wanted

576
00:31:51,260 --> 00:31:55,020
to, I walked in here thinking that I was going to start, like I want to start

577
00:31:55,060 --> 00:32:00,060
talking like the text from those kind of games, not like not in Japanese, just

578
00:32:00,060 --> 00:32:04,880
like hello travelers. I'm here with Patrick Patrick and Cameron Cameron, and

579
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:10,260
here we are we're doing our our work for the day. It just is so awesome man. It's

580
00:32:10,260 --> 00:32:14,220
such a fun game, and I just it's making me want to move to some very small

581
00:32:14,220 --> 00:32:17,560
make you want to hang out station schoolers badly.

582
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:22,660
This is so bad. What are these games about persona? You're in high school,

583
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:26,360
and you're a got into so far. I just walk around. They're all different.

584
00:32:26,360 --> 00:32:29,320
They're none of them are connected. They're all just the same story and

585
00:32:29,320 --> 00:32:33,160
see places. It's all about your you're a Japanese high schooler and you find

586
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:37,440
some kind of supernatural serial killer thing going. I had the same. I had the

587
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:41,560
same feeling that you guys are talking about when I played Simpsons hit and run

588
00:32:41,560 --> 00:32:42,520
on the Bart mission.

589
00:32:42,520 --> 00:32:47,460
He said, take me to spring. I was like man. I want to be. I want to be a

590
00:32:47,500 --> 00:32:51,460
Springfield child, so that a weeb for Springfield

591
00:32:51,460 --> 00:32:56,600
I'm walking around. I'm like to Springfield so bad. I wish that this

592
00:32:56,600 --> 00:32:57,720
was real. My friend

593
00:32:57,720 --> 00:33:06,480
start showing up in just the like the plain shirts and pants.

594
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:12,680
I've got my hair spiked and it's died blonde. I'm just sitting just walking

595
00:33:12,680 --> 00:33:13,120
around

596
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:18,320
trying to order a duff at every single bar you go to. Do you have to do you

597
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:21,680
have a duff acting like it's got a pretty? I'm getting a little hungry.

598
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:22,660
Do you have a tomato?

599
00:33:22,660 --> 00:33:28,820
They have this incredible store in Springfield. It's called quickie mart

600
00:33:28,820 --> 00:33:34,200
going into going into a seven eleven and forcing the guy behind the counter to

601
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:37,040
call it a squishy for you lying on your bed with your feet kicked up in the air

602
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:40,560
and spending all day on tick tock swiping through people doing like this

603
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:42,200
is my trip to quickie mart. When I buy

604
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:45,720
this is what quickie mark is quickie mart is like in spring

605
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:47,080
you're watching tic tocs that

606
00:33:47,080 --> 00:33:48,360
barton

607
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:49,560
made

608
00:33:49,560 --> 00:33:58,960
this is what food is like wait eat at quickie mart for an entire day. Okay,

609
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:04,840
here's how many here's everything I ate doing one meal a day at most tavern

610
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:12,460
Dude, I want to be there so badly, man. Yeah, here's my day. Okay, it actually

611
00:34:12,460 --> 00:34:17,040
just my heart just broke because can you imagine if Springfield was a real place?

612
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:20,740
Can you imagine how ruined it would be by the Simpsons TV show? You imagine the

613
00:34:20,740 --> 00:34:25,760
tourists and people would flood the most tavern to they would stand on on Homer

614
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:29,780
and Marge's on all day and look try to look in the windows. It would be

615
00:34:29,780 --> 00:34:34,500
completely destroyed. You know, you know what you don't even have to this. This

616
00:34:34,500 --> 00:34:40,180
a real thing bro. Universal Studios Orlando. Yeah. Oh true. Wait that's where you have

617
00:34:40,180 --> 00:34:45,500
to go. I've been there a lot. A lot? Ok Richie. I've been there more than you know. My ex's

618
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:49,580
dad he was obsessed with Halloween Horror Nights and he would fly us down. Wait so you

619
00:34:49,580 --> 00:34:53,260
saw the scary side of Springfield? Oh I saw spooky Springfield. You saw a tree house of

620
00:34:53,260 --> 00:34:58,700
horror type. I would go there. My ex's dad would take us probably every single year.

621
00:34:58,700 --> 00:35:02,260
That would also be a YouTube short that you'd watch that would be like "Everybody likes

622
00:35:02,260 --> 00:35:05,700
like Springfield right. It's a happy normal town, but things get a little

623
00:35:05,700 --> 00:35:06,400
different around

624
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:08,940
have you heard of tree house of order.

625
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:13,660
They didn't do enough tree house of horror stuff, though I will say that I

626
00:35:13,660 --> 00:35:18,100
will say a universal studios step your fucking game up on. We should we need to

627
00:35:18,100 --> 00:35:21,940
do a tree house of horror. I want to go back to horror night so bad. That was

628
00:35:21,940 --> 00:35:25,100
the coolest thing that somebody has ever done for me is maybe bring me down

629
00:35:25,100 --> 00:35:25,380
there.

630
00:35:25,380 --> 00:35:31,300
No, well, no, but like the and I change all the names yeah, so it'd be like

631
00:35:31,500 --> 00:35:38,500
Caleb Spitz, Caleb Pits of Hell, Patrick Do-ran, he ran away from home.

632
00:35:38,500 --> 00:35:39,500
Patrick or Treat.

633
00:35:39,500 --> 00:35:40,500
What?

634
00:35:40,500 --> 00:35:41,500
Patrick or Treat Doran.

635
00:35:41,500 --> 00:35:42,500
Or Patrick.

636
00:35:42,500 --> 00:35:43,500
I thought you said Patrick the Treat.

637
00:35:43,500 --> 00:35:44,500
No, no, no.

638
00:35:44,500 --> 00:35:45,500
What does that mean?

639
00:35:45,500 --> 00:35:46,500
Patrick the Treat.

640
00:35:46,500 --> 00:35:47,500
That's here, we're having some hearing problems.

641
00:35:47,500 --> 00:35:48,500
I thought that earlier you said my Gatorade thing is here.

642
00:35:48,500 --> 00:35:49,500
Yeah, I still don't know how you could have gotten Gatorade out of what?

643
00:35:49,500 --> 00:35:50,500
You said my Larry Wig.

644
00:35:50,500 --> 00:35:51,500
Cameron Fester.

645
00:35:51,500 --> 00:35:52,500
Oh.

646
00:35:52,500 --> 00:35:53,500
Cameron Fester.

647
00:35:53,500 --> 00:35:54,500
I want to make sure I'm not saying the wrong name.

648
00:35:54,500 --> 00:35:55,500
I'm not saying the wrong name.

649
00:35:55,500 --> 00:35:56,500
I'm not saying the wrong name.

650
00:35:56,500 --> 00:35:57,500
I'm not saying the wrong name.

651
00:35:57,500 --> 00:35:58,500
I'm not saying the wrong name.

652
00:35:58,500 --> 00:35:59,500
I'm not saying the wrong name.

653
00:35:59,500 --> 00:36:03,940
Fester. Oh, Cameron Fester. I want to be Uncle Fester. That's good. And then we could call

654
00:36:03,940 --> 00:36:12,260
the show like Frog Ash Abound. Like cast a spell, like a witch. Oh, wrong cast about

655
00:36:12,260 --> 00:36:21,320
spells. Spell cast about tricks. Spell cast about tricks. Yeah, see, this is like our

656
00:36:21,320 --> 00:36:26,860
treehouse of horror thing. Yeah, lips. Spell cast about lips. Yeah, well, that would be

657
00:36:26,860 --> 00:36:32,860
I guess next month we have to do every single episode has to be a treehouse of horror type

658
00:36:32,860 --> 00:36:33,860
thing.

659
00:36:33,860 --> 00:36:37,220
Pod kiss about lips would be our valentines day version of treehouse of horror.

660
00:36:37,220 --> 00:36:38,980
Pod kiss about lips?

661
00:36:38,980 --> 00:36:40,100
Pod kiss about lips?

662
00:36:40,100 --> 00:36:42,820
That's our valentines day thing.

663
00:36:42,820 --> 00:36:44,620
Did you say treehouse of horror?

664
00:36:44,620 --> 00:36:46,100
Valentines day version of treehouse of horror.

665
00:36:46,100 --> 00:36:49,220
What is going on with my hearing today?

666
00:36:49,220 --> 00:36:51,180
I think you got too much variety coffee.

667
00:36:51,180 --> 00:36:53,940
I think I did have too much coffee.

668
00:36:53,940 --> 00:36:56,420
I had a prime and then a coffee.

669
00:36:56,420 --> 00:37:02,660
and I I'm all for I'm all for I'm all for chains of coffee shops and cafes, but

670
00:37:02,660 --> 00:37:07,040
I'd rather have a variety of different local stores than a variety

671
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:08,380
coffee.

672
00:37:08,380 --> 00:37:10,020
Yeah, and

673
00:37:10,020 --> 00:37:15,020
Starbucks, I get that you're hiring these stars, but I ain't giving you a

674
00:37:15,020 --> 00:37:19,140
buck for that trash ass coffee. That's right, yeah, and

675
00:37:19,140 --> 00:37:24,700
Pete, why don't you your business should Peter out? Yeah,

676
00:37:25,380 --> 00:37:29,980
and Jimmy John's. How about you Jimmy your way over? It's not a coffee shop.

677
00:37:29,980 --> 00:37:30,880
Okay.

678
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:35,080
Yeah, I'll touch your Jimmy into the John.

679
00:37:35,080 --> 00:37:38,780
They sell coffee there. Hey, Tim Horton's. It's about...

680
00:37:38,780 --> 00:37:40,980
Hey, Tim Horton's. You pay me.

681
00:37:40,980 --> 00:37:42,880
Yeah, I guess if they pay you.

682
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:46,480
Hey, I'll touch your Jimmy in the John if you pay me. You pay me enough.

683
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:50,780
No. I'll do more than Jimmy it.

684
00:37:50,780 --> 00:37:55,280
Can we go back to coffee? Be like a gymnast. Hey, Tim Horton's. I think

685
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:59,380
think it's about Tim pointing at my wrist. Yeah, it's about ten that you

686
00:37:59,380 --> 00:38:02,140
whores sell a ton of

687
00:38:02,140 --> 00:38:03,240
lemonade.

688
00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:08,560
Tim Horton's this this Horton Horton tastes a poo instead of Horton. Here's

689
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:12,400
a yes. Oh yeah, that's good. That would be that would be clear to and Hey

690
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:15,560
Duncan Donuts, don't even get me started.

691
00:38:15,560 --> 00:38:19,240
How about you dunk yourself

692
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:26,860
into the into a don't go on his canal, Duncan Donuts, your restaurants,

693
00:38:26,860 --> 00:38:30,800
don't on it. Hey, Duncan Donuts, your restaurants great for breakfast, but

694
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:33,600
here's something I'd rather have lunch than donuts.

695
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:34,920
Yeah,

696
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:39,520
like you guys just do breakfast, call it lunch and restaurant. They actually

697
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:43,120
have lunch. Why is it so funny to me to call it to call Duncan Donuts a

698
00:38:43,120 --> 00:38:47,640
restaurant? I don't know. It is technically a restaurant, I guess, but

699
00:38:47,640 --> 00:38:52,240
does it be like yeah, these other these other coffee shops names,

700
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:55,880
because it's all basically there's port city java in Wilmington. There's also

701
00:38:55,880 --> 00:39:01,560
Aroma Joe's. Hey, Aroma Joe's in New Hampshire. Why is it called that? That

702
00:39:01,560 --> 00:39:06,200
makes me think that you're a fart store. That makes me think that you're that

703
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:10,240
makes me think that you're a fart store or a candle store, maybe or maybe a

704
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:15,760
candle store. We should name a coffee shop bean center. Oh, hey, the bean, the

705
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:20,340
The Bean! Is that one? That's one and it's owned by the Jollibee Corporation. Is that

706
00:39:20,340 --> 00:39:25,200
true? I looked it up because I went there one time with Xavier. I don't like that all

707
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:33,060
of the coffee shops... The Bean, how about you be in Dahl and get the hell out of here?

708
00:39:33,060 --> 00:39:37,360
Why is every coffee shop nowadays just one word called like magnet? And how come every

709
00:39:37,360 --> 00:39:43,520
coffee shop just serves breakfast and maybe lunch? Just give me some spaghetti. See, The

710
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:48,100
The bean doesn't have a pretentious staff or annoying coffee names or boring elevator music.

711
00:39:48,100 --> 00:39:51,900
Good, because I'm basically done with the pretentious staffs at these coffee shops.

712
00:39:51,900 --> 00:39:56,040
This lady at the coffee shop at Variety, very nice, but I said, "Can I get that carrot cake

713
00:39:56,040 --> 00:39:57,040
muffin?"

714
00:39:57,040 --> 00:40:00,960
She said, "Oh yeah, well it's not carrot cake, it's a morning glory."

715
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:03,840
Right, and it's not a muffin, it's actually a scoon.

716
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:05,200
And I said, "Oh, okay."

717
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:10,140
Shoved the muffin in her mouth, made it break away all the edges and stuff.

718
00:40:10,140 --> 00:40:11,140
You didn't do that.

719
00:40:11,140 --> 00:40:12,280
You actually had a good time there.

720
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:15,940
I didn't have a good. I wasn't yet a great time there. I have a good time at

721
00:40:15,940 --> 00:40:16,400
the new

722
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:20,760
coffee shop. You had a good time. There's a fun over there. You had fun. We had

723
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:24,120
enough fun. I said, Hey, we got an officer here and then I said I'll be

724
00:40:24,120 --> 00:40:27,280
seeing a lot of you and she said that yeah, she said, okay,

725
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:32,340
and then because I'm trying to go on a date, we're trying to we're trying to

726
00:40:32,340 --> 00:40:36,320
develop a community. I don't want to put them out of business. You want to

727
00:40:36,320 --> 00:40:40,800
start? We said that we talked about that. We talked about putting a free

728
00:40:40,820 --> 00:40:47,260
a sign on our office door or a sign that says variety coffee, extra seating,

729
00:40:47,260 --> 00:40:49,060
a bunch of chairs.

730
00:40:49,060 --> 00:40:54,020
I have no coffee at all. Just make people come in here and just guys try

731
00:40:54,020 --> 00:40:57,100
to work on their laptop. And we're sitting here just screaming. Yeah,

732
00:40:57,100 --> 00:40:57,940
we're making it

733
00:40:57,940 --> 00:41:00,540
funny to put audience seats in here. It says hey.

734
00:41:00,540 --> 00:41:05,620
I do want to do- Need somewhere to drink your coffee? Come watch us record

735
00:41:05,620 --> 00:41:09,900
the podcast. I want to do like a Good Burger or like Barbershop style war with

736
00:41:09,940 --> 00:41:16,300
business across the street. And we need to like, we have to turn into a coffee shop.

737
00:41:16,300 --> 00:41:17,820
We just need to like ruin their business.

738
00:41:17,820 --> 00:41:24,980
You know what would be so funny is if they were trying to buy this office space for their

739
00:41:24,980 --> 00:41:25,980
coffee shop.

740
00:41:25,980 --> 00:41:26,980
It's just too small.

741
00:41:26,980 --> 00:41:30,100
Yeah, actually there's not two exits. Well, there is two exits, but you know, it's not.

742
00:41:30,100 --> 00:41:31,420
This isn't zoned for that.

743
00:41:31,420 --> 00:41:33,100
Yeah, this is definitely not zoned for that.

744
00:41:33,100 --> 00:41:37,340
Maybe for my eventual kombucha bar, but not for coffee.

745
00:41:37,340 --> 00:41:39,340
What's your kombucha company's name?

746
00:41:39,340 --> 00:41:43,340
Turd Shine.

747
00:41:43,340 --> 00:41:45,340
Turd Shine?

748
00:41:45,340 --> 00:41:47,340
Like June Shine?

749
00:41:47,340 --> 00:41:49,340
No man.

750
00:41:49,340 --> 00:41:51,340
I don't know. I haven't come up with a name yet.

751
00:41:51,340 --> 00:41:53,340
Poon Shine?

752
00:41:53,340 --> 00:41:55,340
It would probably be called like

753
00:41:55,340 --> 00:41:57,340
Particulate.

754
00:41:57,340 --> 00:41:59,340
That's not a good name.

755
00:41:59,340 --> 00:42:01,340
What are you talking about?

756
00:42:01,340 --> 00:42:03,340
Particulate?

757
00:42:03,340 --> 00:42:05,340
Particulate is not a good name for kombucha.

758
00:42:05,340 --> 00:42:11,320
a particular there's a there's a problem all that's come hard particular there's

759
00:42:11,320 --> 00:42:15,980
a really uh... uh... big problem a small batch kombucha is where they have little

760
00:42:15,980 --> 00:42:18,660
worms in them here's all of it you know she

761
00:42:18,660 --> 00:42:21,540
because the scobey i was trying to tell you and i think we're going to be a

762
00:42:21,540 --> 00:42:23,180
particular

763
00:42:23,180 --> 00:42:27,600
i find it hard to get a fine if i was making a worm booted karma form organism

764
00:42:27,600 --> 00:42:29,620
my friend of verma form

765
00:42:29,620 --> 00:42:30,480
was that

766
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:31,500
verma form

767
00:42:31,500 --> 00:42:34,260
warm shape verma form warm shape

768
00:42:34,260 --> 00:42:38,860
Vermiform means worms. Vermiform, worm, shipe. You called it a particulate. Well,

769
00:42:38,860 --> 00:42:43,180
you said vermiform, so you also, you went too far. You also went, I know I'm

770
00:42:43,180 --> 00:42:46,200
trying to get his attention. You did get my attention. You can just snap him out

771
00:42:46,200 --> 00:42:50,140
of it. You can just tap his stuff. I don't want to touch him. You don't want

772
00:42:50,140 --> 00:42:55,840
to touch him. So genuine. I don't want to touch him. I've definitely had too

773
00:42:55,840 --> 00:42:59,360
much coffee. I honestly want to keep my arms crossed all day today. Yeah, that's

774
00:42:59,380 --> 00:43:01,000
is what we call bad news.

775
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:06,020
Is you get across my arms all day today? I don't have a neutral express. I had a

776
00:43:06,020 --> 00:43:09,380
waiter the other day and I was crossing my arms way too much and I got in my

777
00:43:09,380 --> 00:43:12,300
head about it and was like, this guy thinks I'm such an asshole, because he's

778
00:43:12,300 --> 00:43:15,220
crossing your arm. He's bringing me food and shit and I'm just sitting there with

779
00:43:15,220 --> 00:43:18,700
my arms crossed like a dickhead, but he doesn't realise that my hands get cold.

780
00:43:18,700 --> 00:43:22,820
Yeah, yeah, you're sitting there. The worst types of arm crossing in public.

781
00:43:22,820 --> 00:43:26,940
Yeah, I look so bitchy. Speaking of you remember weird types of arm crossing.

782
00:43:26,980 --> 00:43:28,700
never seen another human being ever do.

783
00:43:28,700 --> 00:43:29,700
Show me.

784
00:43:29,700 --> 00:43:30,700
You've seen me do it.

785
00:43:30,700 --> 00:43:31,700
I mean, yes, I have.

786
00:43:31,700 --> 00:43:32,700
This?

787
00:43:32,700 --> 00:43:34,220
I do this.

788
00:43:34,220 --> 00:43:35,220
That is pitiful.

789
00:43:35,220 --> 00:43:36,900
Yeah, I do this a lot.

790
00:43:36,900 --> 00:43:37,900
Well, that's thinkerly.

791
00:43:37,900 --> 00:43:39,820
That one's more normal, but it's still bad to do.

792
00:43:39,820 --> 00:43:41,780
You should only do that at the library.

793
00:43:41,780 --> 00:43:44,460
This one is the terrible one that I just realized I'm doing.

794
00:43:44,460 --> 00:43:46,900
This is purely pitiful concert goers.

795
00:43:46,900 --> 00:43:47,900
It's insane.

796
00:43:47,900 --> 00:43:49,300
I do it when I'm talking to people.

797
00:43:49,300 --> 00:43:50,300
That's like the...

798
00:43:50,300 --> 00:43:51,300
To people I don't know.

799
00:43:51,300 --> 00:43:53,900
That fucking photo of Jake in the hard times.

800
00:43:53,900 --> 00:43:54,900
Remember that one?

801
00:43:54,900 --> 00:43:55,900
Oh, yeah.

802
00:43:55,900 --> 00:43:56,900
Yeah.

803
00:43:56,900 --> 00:44:02,700
out that was him. That was awesome. I need to be in another Onion article. Yeah. Oh yeah

804
00:44:02,700 --> 00:44:08,340
because you're, it's just a family photo. They used a photo from my mom's Facebook.

805
00:44:08,340 --> 00:44:11,660
You don't think that's unlike, you've never checked the Wayback Machine? You don't remember

806
00:44:11,660 --> 00:44:20,660
the name of the article? It was called Gay Guy Spotted in Family Photo. Gay Family Spotted

807
00:44:20,660 --> 00:44:27,700
looking like shit. No, no, no, that's not true, man. No, it really isn't true. It

808
00:44:27,700 --> 00:44:31,360
was investigative journalism from the Onion. It was it was called like

809
00:44:31,360 --> 00:44:38,820
amazing. These two orphans finally got adopted and then killed their parents or

810
00:44:38,820 --> 00:44:42,340
something. It was something with a dark twist. Yeah, and it was like the first

811
00:44:42,340 --> 00:44:45,760
couple of weeks that the that the click hole was open. I think it was click.

812
00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:49,460
Oh, it wasn't. Yeah, it was click. Oh, yeah, dude, you never thought to look on.

813
00:44:49,460 --> 00:44:53,180
you never thought to look on the way back machine for that? No. They definitely

814
00:44:53,180 --> 00:44:58,460
have. They probably have it saved from day one. My mom emailed them and asked

815
00:44:58,460 --> 00:45:02,300
them to replace the photo. Well, how'd she find out about it? Fucking do look

816
00:45:02,300 --> 00:45:07,100
for it. My brother sent it in our family group chat and was like, look how funny

817
00:45:07,100 --> 00:45:11,220
this shit is. They used a picture of you guys on the thing. And we were like, oh

818
00:45:11,220 --> 00:45:15,060
yeah, that's awesome. And then my mom was like, just sent an email. This is

819
00:45:15,060 --> 00:45:19,260
unacceptable. They took this from my Facebook page. And we were like, fuck you

820
00:45:19,260 --> 00:45:25,660
bitch. This was awesome for like two seconds. It made us so mad. Why were they on our Facebook?

821
00:45:25,660 --> 00:45:28,860
I'm going to look for it. Probably thought she was hot, dude. Yeah. Oh, it's a fucking

822
00:45:28,860 --> 00:45:36,220
smoke show. The click hole editors. Click on her hole. What are you talking about your mom like

823
00:45:36,220 --> 00:45:39,820
that? I forgot I was talking about my mom for a second. You said your mom is a smoke show and

824
00:45:39,820 --> 00:45:44,460
they're going to click on her hole. Kind of blacked out for a second. I'm sorry. I don't have a sister,

825
00:45:44,460 --> 00:45:47,860
but somebody hot in my family, imagine it was about that instead.

826
00:45:47,860 --> 00:45:48,360
Warning!

827
00:45:48,360 --> 00:45:53,860
What kind of warning? What kind of bullshit warning is this?

828
00:45:53,860 --> 00:45:55,860
No!

829
00:45:55,860 --> 00:45:57,860
Okay, Mr. Chicago.

830
00:45:57,860 --> 00:45:59,860
Just a little defensive kind of voice that I did.

831
00:45:59,860 --> 00:46:01,860
A defensive Chicago voice?

832
00:46:01,860 --> 00:46:02,360
No, no, no.

833
00:46:02,360 --> 00:46:04,360
Was that defensive Miller? Is that what that was?

834
00:46:04,360 --> 00:46:06,360
It was a little defensive Miller, I'm sorry.

835
00:46:06,360 --> 00:46:08,360
What kind of bullshit warning is that?

836
00:46:08,360 --> 00:46:10,360
Yeah, I don't want that warning.

837
00:46:10,360 --> 00:46:16,560
You got the warning. Buddy, that warning is the warning they could have used when Napoleon Bonaparte

838
00:46:16,560 --> 00:46:23,160
was getting fucked by the other army. I don't know too much about history. I can't really do Dennis Miller stuff.

839
00:46:23,160 --> 00:46:30,360
I love all those videos. He always has some very weird reference that he does to prove that he's a smart guy.

840
00:46:30,360 --> 00:46:37,360
And I hate those episodes where he has Norm on and everything that Norm says, he just goes like,

841
00:46:37,360 --> 00:46:41,120
"Norm, buddy, you're a riot."

842
00:46:41,120 --> 00:46:43,120
He just says that like 40 times.

843
00:46:43,120 --> 00:46:46,000
And Norm's just like talking about the lunch that he ate.

844
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:48,000
And he's like, "Oh, what?"

845
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:50,000
"You had a turkey sandwich?"

846
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:54,000
"I had a sandwich, you know, I had, you know, like, cut in half."

847
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:56,800
"Let me guess, Norm, it was a club sandwich?"

848
00:46:56,800 --> 00:46:57,920
"Yeah, yeah."

849
00:46:57,920 --> 00:46:58,560
"Oh, Norm!"

850
00:46:58,560 --> 00:47:01,520
"Hey, you know, I don't even know what kind of club it is."

851
00:47:01,520 --> 00:47:02,800
"Normie, you kill me."

852
00:47:02,800 --> 00:47:05,680
"I don't even know what club this sandwich is from."

853
00:47:05,680 --> 00:47:10,080
Oh, Norm, you're just too good.

854
00:47:10,080 --> 00:47:11,480
It's one of the worst things ever.

855
00:47:11,480 --> 00:47:12,480
That's every Dennis Miller interview.

856
00:47:12,480 --> 00:47:14,280
And he went on probably 4,000 times.

857
00:47:14,280 --> 00:47:16,200
Yeah, he was good friends with Dennis Miller.

858
00:47:16,200 --> 00:47:17,200
Yeah.

859
00:47:17,200 --> 00:47:21,040
Dennis Miller, you are a conservative asswipe.

860
00:47:21,040 --> 00:47:22,920
I hate conservative asswipes.

861
00:47:22,920 --> 00:47:23,920
You are a fucking conservative asswipe.

862
00:47:23,920 --> 00:47:26,120
You know, I had a nightmare the other day.

863
00:47:26,120 --> 00:47:27,120
About what?

864
00:47:27,120 --> 00:47:28,120
I had a daughter and...

865
00:47:28,120 --> 00:47:29,120
Hey, there's the nightmare.

866
00:47:29,120 --> 00:47:32,120
No, it's not really a nightmare.

867
00:47:32,120 --> 00:47:33,120
That's the nightmare.

868
00:47:33,120 --> 00:47:34,120
It gets worse.

869
00:47:34,120 --> 00:47:35,120
Okay.

870
00:47:35,120 --> 00:47:40,960
Uh-huh. She walks in, bringing her boyfriend, first time meeting him over for dinner.

871
00:47:40,960 --> 00:47:46,320
Dennis Miller? Not Dennis Miller. That would have been acceptable. My 16-year-old daughter

872
00:47:46,320 --> 00:47:51,520
is on a date with Dennis. My 24-year-old daughter brought home a white boyfriend.

873
00:47:51,520 --> 00:47:59,600
That was your nightmare? Insane nightmare. Yeah. I'm a liberal democrat. I'm not going to have this

874
00:47:59,600 --> 00:48:02,640
in my fucking house. You don't want your daughter dating a little... Bringing home a white boy. Oh

875
00:48:02,640 --> 00:48:03,540
- Oh, fuck no.

876
00:48:03,540 --> 00:48:05,780
- Little five foot two Filipino guy who's good at pool.

877
00:48:05,780 --> 00:48:07,120
- Yes, that's what I want.

878
00:48:07,120 --> 00:48:08,560
- I know that's exactly what you want.

879
00:48:08,560 --> 00:48:13,360
- I don't want a whitey coming into my house.

880
00:48:13,360 --> 00:48:14,360
They smell weird.

881
00:48:14,360 --> 00:48:15,840
- Yeah, they smell like butterscotch.

882
00:48:15,840 --> 00:48:17,240
- They smell like PB&J.

883
00:48:17,240 --> 00:48:20,880
- Walking in smelling like an old book at the library.

884
00:48:20,880 --> 00:48:22,560
You better not put that.

885
00:48:22,560 --> 00:48:25,000
- Every single white boyfriend of your daughter

886
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:28,440
smells like a copy of Moby Dick that has mold on it.

887
00:48:28,440 --> 00:48:29,760
- Buddy, if you're--

888
00:48:29,760 --> 00:48:31,280
- From being in the library too long.

889
00:48:31,280 --> 00:48:35,440
whatever you do to my daughter, you better do to me. I'm going to do it to

890
00:48:35,440 --> 00:48:38,640

891
00:48:38,640 --> 00:48:39,160

892
00:48:39,160 --> 00:48:45,160

Oh, my hands are coming back with British accents.

925
00:50:51,120 --> 00:50:55,080
My oldest daughter is at Big Ben, but my youngest is at Parliament.

926
00:50:55,080 --> 00:51:00,840
Why would your chest be Big Ben and your dick should be Big Ben?

927
00:51:00,840 --> 00:51:03,840
I don't know, I didn't think it through.

928
00:51:03,840 --> 00:51:06,840
Yeah, why is the penis Parliament?

929
00:51:06,840 --> 00:51:07,840
This father is weird.

Yeah, they have Little, Medium, Big, and Extra Large.

935
00:51:15,340 --> 00:51:20,580

936
00:51:20,580 --> 00:51:25,380
on the ground, let's talk about the differences between the you, the EU and

937
00:51:25,380 --> 00:51:29,920
the US. It does piss me off that they name clocks over there. Yeah. What kind

938
00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:34,140
of backwards bullshit is we don't even have the name of a clock at least I

939
00:51:34,140 --> 00:51:37,580
would name a clock. Oh, that's big Ben. Well, what the fuck is this then? Huh?

Yeah, what's this? That's one of the one. What's this little Caleb? Hello,

That's interesting.

948
00:52:15,900 --> 00:52:20,480
being alone traveling in traveling to London and doing that on like a tour?

949

00:52:59,500 --> 00:53:02,780
to be signing on a grass, put a name tag on them and you have a mini name.

961
00:53:02,780 --> 00:53:06,260
Hello, my name is watching

962
00:53:06,260 --> 00:53:07,660
I

963
00:53:07,660 --> 00:53:10,820
was this

964
00:53:10,820 --> 00:53:18,780
girl. Oh, who's that? Is that Mickey Mouse on your watch? Sorry, lady looks

965
00:53:18,780 --> 00:53:22,060
like our watches are in love. Guess I'm gonna have to go home with you. I didn't

966
00:53:22,060 --> 00:53:22,940
book a hotel.

967
00:53:22,940 --> 00:53:29,260
It's almost like we're like in laws now, because our watches fell in love.

968
00:53:29,260 --> 00:53:33,940
Yours is kind of more the strong silent type. Yeah, I can't get watch you to

969
00:53:33,940 --> 00:53:35,140
shut the hell up.

970
00:53:35,140 --> 00:53:42,760
Yeah, I said, well, yeah, maybe, maybe watching and you're watching, you know, hang out, maybe

971
00:53:42,760 --> 00:53:44,460
we'll learn something from them.

972
00:53:44,460 --> 00:53:45,860
We'll see what happens.

973
00:53:45,860 --> 00:53:47,380
See where the night takes them.

974
00:53:47,380 --> 00:53:48,380
Somebody's talking to you.

975
00:53:48,380 --> 00:53:52,300
They're, they're asking you at one of the restaurants, what would you like to eat?

976
00:53:52,300 --> 00:53:56,740
And then watch he starts ordering and you have to cover him up real quick.

977
00:53:56,740 --> 00:53:58,660
He did not say the A5 Wagyu.

978
00:53:58,660 --> 00:53:59,660
Watch he does.

979
00:53:59,660 --> 00:54:00,660
Yeah.

980
00:54:00,660 --> 00:54:01,660
Watch he does market price.

981
00:54:01,660 --> 00:54:02,660
What are you doing?

982
00:54:02,660 --> 00:54:03,660
Come on.

983
00:54:03,660 --> 00:54:05,460
live a little

984
00:54:05,460 --> 00:54:11,100
okay. We are not getting a serpent. What you get the turf? I'll eat the

985
00:54:11,100 --> 00:54:14,320
watchy

986
00:54:14,320 --> 00:54:21,100
like what are you doing? You're like oh it's watchy like if that's big Ben,

987
00:54:21,100 --> 00:54:22,260
then what's this watchy

988
00:54:22,260 --> 00:54:26,900
pointing out that we're nowhere near big Ben. You're not in London. Yeah,

989
00:54:26,900 --> 00:54:30,900
like at that point on a Europe vacation, that's big Ben, then this has got to

990
00:54:30,940 --> 00:54:35,180
watch or some shit. Yeah, I came up with in the watching you came in. It was

991
00:54:35,180 --> 00:54:39,420
crazy. I know I'm in Italy, but if we could see Big Ben, this would make a lot

992
00:54:39,420 --> 00:54:44,800
of sense. If you know a Big Ben, he's like basically watchy on steroids, but he

993
00:54:44,800 --> 00:54:50,220
doesn't talk that much, but Jackie Chan did a fight on him and I'm hoping to get

994
00:54:50,220 --> 00:54:53,260
Jackie Chan involved. Yeah, we want a little Jackie Chan on watchy.

995
00:54:53,260 --> 00:54:59,420
It's just a good idea, man. I think that I think that we could even make a some

996
00:54:59,460 --> 00:55:04,260
kind of electronic watch that maybe it says as eyes. Well, maybe like a GPS

997
00:55:04,260 --> 00:55:05,060
man, yeah,

998
00:55:05,060 --> 00:55:10,420
you know how GPS is say like it really get an apple watch setting for one.

999
00:55:10,420 --> 00:55:14,220
There's an app you can get for apple watch that makes watchy called make me

1000
00:55:14,220 --> 00:55:18,060
watchy make me watchy. I become watch dot IO.

1001
00:55:18,060 --> 00:55:24,060
Yeah, you have to homebrew it. You have to like like jailbreak your wife and

1002
00:55:24,060 --> 00:55:28,020
then it's just a little face. Why aren't talk? Why aren't apps told not to learn

1003
00:55:28,060 --> 00:55:33,920
apps titled in the first person. They used to be yeah. Jinx I beer I beer yeah,

1004
00:55:33,920 --> 00:55:38,020
I watch, but I am like when I early up

1005
00:55:38,020 --> 00:55:44,240
what's the car? I Carly, I Carly, I know I Carly the name of the show. We need to

1006
00:55:44,240 --> 00:55:49,420
be called I I Carly. Well, the app that I Carly was named after an app. Yeah, it

1007
00:55:49,420 --> 00:55:52,740
was no better and there was all and all the phones were pairs. It's bullshit

1008
00:55:52,740 --> 00:55:56,540
apples. It was in some sort of weird parallel universe. It was an attempt to

1009
00:55:56,700 --> 00:56:00,000
court the child demographic, but unfortunately one of the producers

1010
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:02,840
tried to court the child demographic in a different way. I'm trying to go to

1011
00:56:02,840 --> 00:56:07,320
court. Yeah, he went to court graphically demoing children. Yeah, he made up to

1012
00:56:07,320 --> 00:56:11,200
children. He said we're entering courtship. I'm courting you. I would like

1013
00:56:11,200 --> 00:56:15,560
to woo your affections young lady. He made those children put ketchup on their

1014
00:56:15,560 --> 00:56:15,960
feet.

1015
00:56:15,960 --> 00:56:21,760
Yeah, that's a video. That's a video of Victoria Justice or Ariana Grande and

1016
00:56:21,760 --> 00:56:25,160
he's like, what are you buddy a cannibal? What do you want to eat their toes?

1017
00:56:25,200 --> 00:56:29,240
are you a cannibal only it's hey hey buddy buddy watch a shut up with the

1018
00:56:29,240 --> 00:56:33,360
enough with the jokes watchy watchy. These jokes don't make very much sense.

1019
00:56:33,360 --> 00:56:36,960
What are you a cannibal that only eat feet when the kids are alive and only

1020
00:56:36,960 --> 00:56:37,900
got kids feed and

1021
00:56:37,900 --> 00:56:42,160
watching this is not watching watching you sound insane.

1022
00:56:42,160 --> 00:56:46,560
You said hello. Who's that? Oh yeah, I can put you on the watch. He

1023
00:56:46,560 --> 00:56:53,200
watch. He gets a call SNL audition. Oh my God, you're standing there studio

1024
00:56:53,240 --> 00:56:57,440
whatever holding your foot, holding your off stage, holding your hand on stage.

1025
00:56:57,440 --> 00:57:01,040
He's doing different impressions and you feel you feel you know that's big Ben.

1026
00:57:01,040 --> 00:57:06,220
What am I watching? Yeah, so we love you feeling we love watching, but I don't

1027
00:57:06,220 --> 00:57:10,360
know yeah, we're thinking I don't know. Maybe somebody else's wrist, maybe John

1028
00:57:10,360 --> 00:57:14,400
legends wrist. Yeah, maybe we could put watch on John legend. I mean, love it so

1029
00:57:14,400 --> 00:57:17,200
it's love. It's good come back. We could have love. It's come back. That's a good

1030
00:57:17,200 --> 00:57:20,880
idea. Watchy and why is John love? It's a little bit yeah.

1031
00:57:20,880 --> 00:57:22,800
Oh my God,

1032
00:57:22,800 --> 00:57:26,080
Watchy and Lovitz on the radio.

1033
00:57:26,080 --> 00:57:27,200
- On the radio?

1034
00:57:27,200 --> 00:57:30,160
- No, you gotta see Watchy has a face for TV, man.

1035
00:57:30,160 --> 00:57:31,000
Come on.

1036
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:32,280
- I say I literally have a face.

1037
00:57:32,280 --> 00:57:33,120
- What do I got a face?

1038
00:57:33,120 --> 00:57:33,940
- Dude, and then wait.

1039
00:57:33,940 --> 00:57:34,780
- I literally got a face!

1040
00:57:34,780 --> 00:57:35,620
- And then guys.

1041
00:57:35,620 --> 00:57:36,440
- I literally have a face.

1042
00:57:36,440 --> 00:57:38,400
- Yeah, and I got two hands too.

1043
00:57:38,400 --> 00:57:40,460
- What about this, man?

1044
00:57:40,460 --> 00:57:42,400
You see a paparazzi photo of Paris Hilton

1045
00:57:42,400 --> 00:57:43,800
getting out of a limo, right?

1046
00:57:43,800 --> 00:57:44,640
- Oh shit.

1047
00:57:44,640 --> 00:57:46,760
- And she has no panties on,

1048
00:57:46,760 --> 00:57:49,920
and just kind of hanging below her skirt,

1049
00:57:49,920 --> 00:57:51,160
you see just this.

1050
00:57:51,160 --> 00:57:53,160
(laughter)

1051
00:57:53,160 --> 00:57:55,160
I was thinking a different thing where it's like

1052
00:57:55,160 --> 00:57:57,160
Wachi is uh

1053
00:57:57,160 --> 00:57:59,160
like leaving a car, right?

1054
00:57:59,160 --> 00:58:01,160
And you just see

1055
00:58:01,160 --> 00:58:03,160
that. You see a walking

1056
00:58:03,160 --> 00:58:05,160
Wachi's gaping hole. Oh no

1057
00:58:05,160 --> 00:58:07,160
that's not his hole

1058
00:58:07,160 --> 00:58:09,160
I'm saying what if Paris Hilton shoved

1059
00:58:09,160 --> 00:58:11,160
him up her fucking pussy. Then where is Wachi's genitals?

1060
00:58:11,160 --> 00:58:13,160
Inside of his body.

1061
00:58:13,160 --> 00:58:15,160
His whole body is a genital.

1062
00:58:15,160 --> 00:58:17,160
His entire body is a genital. That's what I'm saying.

1063
00:58:17,160 --> 00:58:19,160
Interesting. He could please women by

1064
00:58:19,160 --> 00:58:20,620
being shot up inside of him.

1065
00:58:20,620 --> 00:58:22,900
Okay, so this is his face and then the back is his body.

1066
00:58:22,900 --> 00:58:25,400
He doesn't need, he's a watch. He doesn't have a body.

1067
00:58:25,400 --> 00:58:27,540
He has a bracelet and a face.

1068
00:58:27,540 --> 00:58:30,060
Man, is he shit and piss.

1069
00:58:30,060 --> 00:58:31,800
He doesn't shit and piss, he's a fucking watch.

1070
00:58:31,800 --> 00:58:32,840
He does not even real.

1071
00:58:32,840 --> 00:58:33,740
What?

1072
00:58:33,740 --> 00:58:35,840
If that's Big Ben, this is watchy.

1073
00:58:35,840 --> 00:58:37,100
That was the original thing.

1074
00:58:37,100 --> 00:58:39,640
But he's become his own thing now.

1075
00:58:39,640 --> 00:58:43,720
Well, it's not a real, this isn't true, Patrick.

1076
00:58:43,720 --> 00:58:45,980
We're making all this shit up and we were saying that.

1077
00:58:45,980 --> 00:58:47,320
Do you know what he's talking about?

1078
00:58:47,320 --> 00:58:54,320
Maybe we can find a middle ground. Maybe Wachi will be like, "I'll be right back. This guy has to go piss and shit."

1079
00:58:54,320 --> 00:58:57,320
And then he can still take bathroom breaks.

1080
00:58:57,320 --> 00:59:01,320
He shits and pisses for the guy. Wachi shits and pisses.

1081
00:59:01,320 --> 00:59:04,320
No, no, no. Wachi doesn't do anything.

1082
00:59:04,320 --> 00:59:06,320
Dude, how are you not understanding this?

1083
00:59:06,320 --> 00:59:07,320
Wachi's hands move around.

1084
00:59:07,320 --> 00:59:09,320
Wachi is just the guy making a voice.

1085
00:59:09,320 --> 00:59:11,320
That was the whole thing. And he's schizophrenic.

1086
00:59:11,320 --> 00:59:12,320
And he's pretending that...

1087
00:59:12,320 --> 00:59:14,320
If this is Big Ben, that's Wachi.

1088
00:59:14,320 --> 00:59:15,320
Or if that's Big Ben.

1089
00:59:15,320 --> 00:59:18,080
that's big Ben. This is big Ben, then what's that

1090
00:59:18,080 --> 00:59:25,280
way? Look up this was big Ben look up really slowly. This is a watch and who

1091
00:59:25,280 --> 00:59:26,320
wait

1092
00:59:26,320 --> 00:59:31,200
take that off real quick. Why do you keep one my watchy and by the way it's a

1093
00:59:31,200 --> 00:59:31,840
watchy now

1094
00:59:31,840 --> 00:59:37,200
holy shit is that a tree house of horror vibes is that is this what my arm would

1095
00:59:37,200 --> 00:59:41,320
look like if I was dead, putting watching on a severed arm. That's actually scary

1096
00:59:41,360 --> 00:59:47,400
fuck. He couldn't figure out how to do that. That's how Wachy can live on his own. Just

1097
00:59:47,400 --> 00:59:52,640
put him on an arm. It's just like that Tales from the Crypt episode with the dummy. I didn't

1098
00:59:52,640 --> 00:59:56,320
see that one. With Don Rickles? I've seen maybe two or three episodes of Tales from

1099
00:59:56,320 --> 01:00:00,560
the Crypt. These days it would be Tales with the Crypts and Bloods and the fucking... Well

1100
01:00:00,560 --> 01:00:06,160
there's blood in the Crypt. Blood in the Crypts. Blood on my Crypt. They have to have done

1101
01:00:06,160 --> 01:00:10,360
Tales from the Crypt episode about the Bloods and the Crypts. What's scarier than this?

1102
01:00:10,360 --> 01:00:10,860
yeah

1103
01:00:10,860 --> 01:00:15,760
walking around what is way and I'm getting beat up by a bunch of gangs,

1104
01:00:15,760 --> 01:00:19,000
because I'm wearing all fucking pink in the middle of honestly. Now that I

1105
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:22,120
think about it, if every if horror movie directors, they're trying to make

1106
01:00:22,120 --> 01:00:25,800
movies that are scary right. So every time that a horror movie director is

1107
01:00:25,800 --> 01:00:30,480
making a movie and it's about and it's about a werewolf or a vampire or a

1108
01:00:30,480 --> 01:00:34,960
ghost, they're basically literally saying. I think that ghosts are scarier

1109
01:00:34,960 --> 01:00:37,820
than the bloods in the cribs. It's like the bloods of the if you're trying to

1110
01:00:37,880 --> 01:00:40,640
scare people with your movie. Well, you're not putting the bloods and the

1111
01:00:40,640 --> 01:00:44,980
crypts in the movie. You are saying no, I think it's exactly. I think that a

1112
01:00:44,980 --> 01:00:48,840
ghost or a vampire is scarier than violence on the street. It's exactly like

1113
01:00:48,840 --> 01:00:53,720
Freddy Krueger, though, where you make the they're only scary and they only

1114
01:00:53,720 --> 01:00:57,480
have power. If you give them power, they have plenty of power. Well, we used to

1115
01:00:57,480 --> 01:01:02,240
have vampires. Now there's so much fanfare about Justin Bieber, Taylor

1116
01:01:02,240 --> 01:01:06,480
Swift and Olivia Rodrigo, Justin Bay Bay Bay Bay Bay. You used to have

1117
01:01:06,520 --> 01:01:09,880
vampires. Now there's fan fire about just a

1118
01:01:09,880 --> 01:01:14,220
and a bear

1119
01:01:14,220 --> 01:01:21,720
and watching the bear, the buyer on hello on how you like hello. Hello,

1120
01:01:21,720 --> 01:01:23,080
hello,

1121
01:01:23,080 --> 01:01:25,160
why do you keep saying hello?

1122
01:01:25,160 --> 01:01:28,400
Can't really do it with hulu.

1123
01:01:28,400 --> 01:01:33,800
Hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, I'm watching

1124
01:01:35,880 --> 01:01:40,920
you're watching who is a TV name watch because you watch. Oh my God,

1125
01:01:40,920 --> 01:01:45,280
watch it's like Garfield tale of two kitties where there's watch and there's

1126
01:01:45,280 --> 01:01:46,920
watch yeah is that way

1127
01:01:46,920 --> 01:01:53,600
places is and then he tries to put the TV around his wrist. That's such a

1128
01:01:53,600 --> 01:01:55,640
watch and then the watch is on the wall

1129
01:01:55,640 --> 01:02:01,320
right. They switch place. They switch places and no one can tell Friday watch

1130
01:02:01,360 --> 01:02:05,060
Wednesday watch you watch a Wednesday, Wednesday,

1131
01:02:05,060 --> 01:02:11,760
that would be okay. If you in in first real, though, if you did

1132
01:02:11,760 --> 01:02:20,380
I'm trying so hard to think of another stream service, but I'm so to be

1133
01:02:20,380 --> 01:02:22,700
to be or not to be

1134
01:02:22,700 --> 01:02:25,140
to be or not to be

1135
01:02:25,140 --> 01:02:28,720
let's take it to the Max.

1136
01:02:30,580 --> 01:02:31,080
this

1137
01:02:31,080 --> 01:02:43,100
man. What an episode this was not to be to flex or not to flex net net to

1138
01:02:43,100 --> 01:02:46,900
flex net to flex net to flex. Well, what's another one? I mean, you know

1139
01:02:46,900 --> 01:02:47,560
prime

1140
01:02:47,560 --> 01:02:49,060
for

1141
01:02:49,060 --> 01:02:52,760
this is

1142
01:02:56,140 --> 01:02:59,340
All right. Is that time? Is that what it is? Time? Yeah, we do have

1143
01:02:59,340 --> 01:03:04,660
okay. Come to if you're in New York City or if you're a freak and you

1144
01:03:04,660 --> 01:03:11,980
wanna travel, travel on October 20th. October 20th at Littlefield, we have

1145
01:03:11,980 --> 01:03:16,660
a show called World's Biggest... Underworld's Biggest Mummy, and it is

1146
01:03:16,660 --> 01:03:20,620
a tree house of horrification of our sketch group World's Biggest Army.

1147
01:03:20,620 --> 01:03:22,780
World's Biggest Army. So it's almost as if you...

1148
01:03:23,660 --> 01:03:27,500
it's a parody. Yeah. So the funny already starts at the beginning. Yeah,

1149
01:03:27,500 --> 01:03:30,500
the funny starts in the name. The funny starts immediately. So if you like

1150
01:03:30,500 --> 01:03:34,960
shit like that and if you like stuff like Hulu... And Watchee. Hulu. If you

1151
01:03:34,960 --> 01:03:38,180
like stuff like Hulu and Watchee, do not come to the show because it will

1152
01:03:38,180 --> 01:03:41,700
be a completely different type of scary humor. I think I might be writing

1153
01:03:41,700 --> 01:03:44,380
a Watchee sketch. I hate to say it. We will be putting a Watchee Easter

1154
01:03:44,380 --> 01:03:47,740
egg in the show. Watchee could actually be great. We should just do

1155
01:03:47,740 --> 01:03:48,860
Watchee. We'll do Watchee. Yeah.

1156
01:03:48,860 --> 01:03:52,500
Alright. Didn't we do that last time we had a sketch that was a

1157
01:03:52,500 --> 01:03:56,500
a direct rip of something from the show. What did we do? Watchy? I don't

1158
01:03:56,500 --> 01:04:02,740
remember, but also I will be opening for Girl God on November 5th in 2023.

1159
01:04:02,740 --> 01:04:06,340
Shareholder. And there's a shareholders meeting on

1160
01:04:06,340 --> 01:04:12,100
the 28th. 28th. 28th. Come through. Just get your ass in the call and come

1161
01:04:12,100 --> 01:04:16,940
through. And come through. Bring a good cue for us to A. Yeah, we will answer.

1162
01:04:16,940 --> 01:04:20,420
So, basically, what the shareholders is, is we do a little

1163
01:04:22,060 --> 01:04:27,400
fart like that. We do a thing and then I mean if you're already paying for this,

1164
01:04:27,400 --> 01:04:30,660
you probably know what it is. We and then we do a Q and A thing at the end.

1165
01:04:30,660 --> 01:04:34,940
Okay. Do we have anything else to plug?

1166
01:04:34,940 --> 01:04:37,060
Jubio Timber.

1167
01:04:37,060 --> 01:04:43,300
Jubio Timber is still going. It is over. It's over. It's not over. It's almost

1168
01:04:43,300 --> 01:04:46,460
over. I really don't want you guys to have your reaction to this fart be

1169
01:04:46,460 --> 01:04:50,260
recorded forever. No, we're waiting. We're waiting until

1170
01:04:51,260 --> 01:05:18,820
I

1171
01:05:18,820 --> 01:05:22,820
I really enjoyed reading about all your adventures on the blog. It's super hot.

1172
01:05:22,820 --> 01:05:27,820
The fact that you escort me and that I have the opportunity to be with you makes it even hotter.

1173
01:05:27,820 --> 01:05:30,820
I just like the whole experience in general.

1174
01:05:30,820 --> 01:05:36,820
In fact, I get most of my clients either via this blog or via my profile on our escort website.

1175
01:05:36,820 --> 01:05:41,820
Kevin booked me for an hour. He actually considers himself a groupie. I like that.

1176
01:05:41,820 --> 01:05:44,820
So here's a photo of him and- of her and Kevin.

1177
01:05:44,820 --> 01:05:48,820
*laughter*

1178
01:05:48,820 --> 01:05:51,820
I have censored it.

1179
01:05:51,820 --> 01:05:56,820
This is an example of a standard sex job.

1180
01:05:56,820 --> 01:06:02,820
This is, I'm guessing, as fat as you could possibly make your character in Second Life.

1181
01:06:02,820 --> 01:06:07,820
Walking around, I'm not seeing anybody have this kind of body.

1182
01:06:07,820 --> 01:06:14,860
but the uncensored photo he has a he has a bright pink little tiny cock and she is

1183
01:06:14,860 --> 01:06:23,020
and there's a lot more photos from this from this engagement and I would really

1184
01:06:23,020 --> 01:06:28,940
like really quickly like to say so her services cost a thousand Linden an hour

1185
01:06:28,940 --> 01:06:37,300
okay how much is so I looked it up a thousand Linden is three dollars

1186
01:06:37,300 --> 01:06:47,500
For $3 an hour she has sex with guys that don't look exactly like George Clooney.

1187
01:06:47,500 --> 01:06:49,140
Here's another one.

1188
01:06:49,140 --> 01:06:53,260
One of my regular clients is very imaginative and a bit of a pervert.

1189
01:06:53,260 --> 01:06:54,260
Every time he hires me...

1190
01:06:54,260 --> 01:06:56,100
Maybe it's Cameron's rival here.

1191
01:06:56,100 --> 01:06:57,100
You think this is Cameron?

1192
01:06:57,100 --> 01:06:59,100
Oh it could be pervert one.

1193
01:06:59,100 --> 01:07:02,580
Every time he hires me he comes up with another kinky thing to do.

1194
01:07:02,580 --> 01:07:06,460
For some of his dirty fantasies it would be rather difficult to find a non-professional

1195
01:07:06,460 --> 01:07:07,460
partner.

1196
01:07:07,460 --> 01:07:10,080
That's a job for a professional sex worker.

1197
01:07:10,080 --> 01:07:14,700
The last time I met him, he made me kneel in a dirty stall of a pig's die.

1198
01:07:14,700 --> 01:07:19,000
I sat right between a couple of pigs to serve him as a dirty sex toy.

1199
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:20,920
I had a long shower after that one.

1200
01:07:20,920 --> 01:07:23,340
And let's look at a photo from this experience.

1201
01:07:23,340 --> 01:07:24,340
Sex in a pig's die.

1202
01:07:24,340 --> 01:07:25,840
Fucked in a pig's die.

1203
01:07:25,840 --> 01:07:27,840
But the pigs are there!

1204
01:07:27,840 --> 01:07:30,420
(upbeat music)
