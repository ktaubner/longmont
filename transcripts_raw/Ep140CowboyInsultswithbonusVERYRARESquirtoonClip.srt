00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
You're listening to Israel's number one podcast.

00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,580

00:00:06,580 --> 00:00:11,140

13
00:00:21,340 --> 00:00:22,180
- Yeah, I look good.

14
00:00:22,180 --> 00:00:24,820
- You're stealing my thang and my thang.

15
00:00:24,820 --> 00:00:25,660
- I just burped so much.

16
00:00:25,660 --> 00:00:27,140
- And you look terrible.

17
00:00:27,140 --> 00:00:29,400
- That's, Calboy doesn't burp.

00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:34,680

19
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:39,880

20
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:47,040
I guess wherever we're usually- I thought- I don't know how you didn't find one. In my

21
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:51,640
closet. I, well last night I tried to find one- Is that where all the other costumes

22
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:55,320

23
00:00:55,320 --> 00:01:00,300

imagine how good and evil I would look with that hat on you look like shit you

33
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:48,160
You would not look evil with a cowboy hat on.

34
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:53,160
Dude, I would look like the baddest- I'd look like the bad- the evil cow- the cow- man- the cow evil man.

35
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:55,160
You'd look like shit compared to how I look right now.

36
00:01:55,160 --> 00:02:00,160
You look- you're wearing a Rod Stewart hat underneath the cowboy hat. This is not-

37
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:05,160
Well, it won't fit over the headphones, and I'm not- my head's too sweaty.

38
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:06,660
I hate you, dude.

39
00:02:06,660 --> 00:02:09,160
'Cause I was skating 15 minutes ago.

40
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:10,160
Fuck you, man.

41
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:11,160
No, fuck you.

42
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:12,160
You look like shit.

43
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:13,160
No, fuck you.

44
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:14,160
You look like fucking shit.

45
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:15,160
You look like shit.

46
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:22,360
I don't look sick. I'm normal. I don't look sick. You look so sick dude. I don't look sick.

47
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:30,920
Yeah. No. You, your head and your shirt and your your wall are all the same color.

48
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:37,640
Yeah it's cream. It's a beautiful neutral color. It allows for a lot of interior

49
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:44,360
design choices. You know I have a loud duvet cover. You look like, hey Caleb,

50
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:47,840
if you put on if you put on that cowboy hat you'd look more like broke-ass

51
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:57,040
mountain. Broke boy mountain? Yeah. Mm-hmm. You gonna cry? Oh he's crying.

52
00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:01,880
Oh he's crying. He's pretending to have he's pretending to have chew he's

53
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:05,120
pretending of chewing tobacco in his lip right now. I will say it's even more

54
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:08,720
disrespectful that Patrick isn't even wearing the hat. I'm wearing the hat!

55
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:12,200
You're wearing a hat and then headphones over the hat and then you put the cowboy

56
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:15,920
hat over both of those. That doesn't count as wearing a thing. The third thing on your

57
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:25,320
head you're not wearing. Okay, there we go. Now put the headphones on over the cowboy

58
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:38,920
hat. How's this? That's a really good look. I can't hear. You can usually make yourself

59
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:46,720
cry faster than this. What's going on pal? Are you too happy today? Yeah. I've lost my

60
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:51,880
ability dude, I'm having too much fun. Except I just remembered that Pat has a fucking cowboy

61
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:58,200
hat on and I don't. My head's cold, everything sucks dude. Fuck! I'm fine, I'm doing great.

62
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:06,880
I got a cowboy hat. You look like shit! I look good. I hate you! Check this out. Cowboys

63
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:14,160
didn't have glasses stop I don't know where my technology wasn't around

64
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:18,360
cowboy some there were prospectors with glad to be a cowboy without perfect

65
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:24,440
vision shut the fuck up you could know and even if you didn't you wouldn't wear

66
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:27,720
glasses cuz you're a cowboy you don't have to read anything you have to read

67
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:33,120
directions yeah you have to read what is the wanted posters they just guessed

68
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:36,080
they had to read the wanted posters. What do you mean they just guessed?

69
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:40,000
They would get the wrong guy a lot. You have to read the poster and see if it was dead or alive.

70
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,120
Or if it's dead or alive. A real cowboy didn't care!

71
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:46,840
I'm a real cowboy. You're not.

72
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:50,240
I am. I'm a real cowboy too. God damn it.

73
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:53,760
I gotta get different headphones. Yeah, you're a cowboy because you're half cow half boy.

74
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:57,400
So? I still have the hat.

75
00:04:57,400 --> 00:05:06,040
That's right. That's a good point. There were no bald cowboys also I have to say.

76
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:11,440
There was like a hundred of them. Zero bald cowboys. They were a gang. They were called

77
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:15,880
the bald bandits. There was no such thing as the bald bandits. They were called the

78
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:22,840
bald bandits. The bald bandits did not exist. Snow the bald. No. There was a group of bandits

79
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:26,920
named the bald bandits mixed truth there was a group of bandits but they weren't

80
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:30,780
bald and they weren't called the bald band no it's not you're not Snopes dude

81
00:05:30,780 --> 00:05:36,000
stop talking like you're Snopes the bald band is Snopes the bald bandits had a

82
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:43,400
movie written by DW Griffith about that's true Caleb's a member of a

83
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:51,160
different modern-day ball okay all right I see how this episode's gonna go now

84
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:56,620
These bald bandits hated the hair on their body so much that they would wear white sleek

85
00:05:56,620 --> 00:05:58,320
sheets to cover them up.

86
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:02,080
Yeah, dude, so nobody knows you're bald.

87
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:03,320
You know?

88
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:06,880
There's definitely never been like a hot KKK guy because why would you cover that face

89
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:07,880
up?

90
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:09,560
That's why I could never join the KKK, too beautiful.

91
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:11,360
I had to take the cowboy hat off.

92
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:16,120
That's why they started cutting eye holes in there because some of them had pretty eyes.

93
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:19,080
Before that they were all just bumping into each other.

94
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:20,080
That's a good point.

95
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:21,080
Yeah.

96
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:23,160
Snopes says so.

97
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:24,640
You don't know Snopes, okay?

98
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:26,720
I think Cameron knows Snopes.

99
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:29,240
Snopes is like a Banksy or Q-type figure.

100
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:34,960
When you get the vaccine, it downloads all of Snopes' knowledge base into your brain

101
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:35,960
through microchip.

102
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:40,280
That would be so surprising to me, I guess.

103
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:44,680
While Biden did say that about black youth, he didn't mean it quite in that way.

104
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:46,360
That phrase is just preloaded into your head.

105
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:48,820
He was being sarcastic.

106
00:06:48,820 --> 00:06:52,500
He was being silly.

107
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:55,700
There was no man named Corn Pop.

108
00:06:55,700 --> 00:07:01,080
While Biden's mouth did move to form those words, there was a racist guy behind him actually

109
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:03,140
saying them.

110
00:07:03,140 --> 00:07:08,400
He was being puppeted by Jeff Dunham.

111
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:16,340
He was doing Bubba J. Yeah, the J in Bubba J stands for Joe Biden.

112
00:07:16,340 --> 00:07:17,340
Bubba Joe.

113
00:07:17,340 --> 00:07:26,860
but Joe Biden. Joe Biden is the old man what's his name? Fart Walter. Fart Walter.

114
00:07:26,860 --> 00:07:35,740
Yeah, Fart Walter. That's definitely, that's the real Joe Biden dude. Mm-hmm.

115
00:07:35,740 --> 00:07:41,660
He's Walter for sure. Well he hates Priuses. He's a total Walter. Yeah Priuses,

116
00:07:41,660 --> 00:07:47,500
he hates Priuses and phones and blackberries and Bluetooth's all this

158
00:11:11,260 --> 00:11:15,780
Not sure

159
00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:18,820
You know I was having fun for like one second on this episode

160
00:11:18,820 --> 00:11:22,300
Then you had to take it back and make fucking make it you wouldn't even have to wear makeup, too

161
00:11:22,300 --> 00:11:26,980
Yeah, face so nice. I'm gonna start doing this when you when you're mean to me

162
00:11:26,980 --> 00:11:31,220
Okay mm-hmm

163
00:11:31,220 --> 00:11:34,100
Fuck you dude if I was a cowboy right now

164
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:37,460
You would not be saying that shit makes out of a six shooter pointed at your brain

165
00:11:37,460 --> 00:11:41,300
I've been spitting in my spittoon this whole episode. You don't have a spittoon either

166
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:43,300
If you have a spittoon show it to me.

167
00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:45,300
And you can't use your foreskin as a spittoon.

168
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:47,300
Then what the fuck? I can't?

169
00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:49,300
Dude, I feel...

170
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:51,300
No. Why not?

171
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:53,300
Empty it out right now. Drain it.

172
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:55,300
I'm calling Dr. Pimple Popper to come

173
00:11:55,300 --> 00:11:57,300
drain your foreskin spittoon right now, dude.

174
00:11:57,300 --> 00:11:59,300
She's not gonna... Nuh-uh.

175
00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:01,300
She's not opening up my

176
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:03,300
foreskin spittoon.

177
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:05,300
Squirtoon.

178
00:12:05,300 --> 00:12:07,300
Fuck.

179
00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:09,300
She's not gonna drain your squirtoon that you've been squirting in all day.

180
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:11,900
I have to do Squirtoon again. That's lost to time forever.

181
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:12,400
Oh.

182
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:12,900
Unless it's found.

183
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:13,900
I was trying to bring it up.

184
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:14,900
I was finding it on a hard drive.

185
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:15,900
You can't bring it up.

186
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:16,900
You fucker.

187
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:22,940
Squirtoon is a lost bit because I think that was a time when Patrick died mid-recording

188
00:12:22,940 --> 00:12:23,940
or something.

189
00:12:23,940 --> 00:12:24,940
Yeah.

190
00:12:24,940 --> 00:12:27,700
We had a really good thing about Squirtoon so you're just going to have to imagine what

191
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:32,260
that is unless I find the file and put it at the end of this episode. Maybe I will.

192
00:12:32,260 --> 00:12:33,260
Maybe I won't.

193
00:12:33,260 --> 00:12:38,860
Pat, you lowdown son of a bitch. If you put that cowboy hat on your head one more time,

194
00:12:38,860 --> 00:12:40,860
I'm putting a damn bounty on your head.

195
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:44,700
All right, $5, dead or alive.

196
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:45,840
- Come get me.

197
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:46,860
- Green light.

198
00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:48,700
- Come get me, I live.

199
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:51,100
- There's a green light on Patrick.

200
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:51,940
- No, there's not.

201
00:12:51,940 --> 00:12:54,740
- Like in John Wick 2 when everyone's trying to get him.

202
00:12:54,740 --> 00:12:56,420
Or is that John Wick 3?

203
00:12:56,420 --> 00:12:57,260
- That is John Wick 4.

204
00:12:57,260 --> 00:12:59,140
- That's right now, that's Caleb Pitts 1,

205
00:12:59,140 --> 00:13:01,460

212
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:19,540
between the Bloods and the Crips and the Cowboys.

00:13:19,540 --> 00:13:28,020
Yeah, you don't want to walk through that neighborhood. That's cowboy country.

277
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:09,120
I didn't I didn't actually buy it. I do have a I do have a surprise coming for Caleb. I did buy him something

278
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:13,400
Please don't be a gun or a bomb.

279
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:14,400
Who knows?

280
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:18,920
I mean if he mails you a gun that's good for you, not for him, right?

281
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:20,800
Like you use that against him.

282
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:23,680
Well no, he opens the package and then the gun shoots.

283
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:26,120
Yeah, the guy, he opens the package.

284
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:28,040
Joker style trap.

285
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:31,240
But he accidentally faces the package the wrong way so the gun shoots out the window

286
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:34,200
and kills Patrick who's watching with binoculars.

287
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:35,400
Yes.

288
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:37,640
It's a bear at 50 cal.

289
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:43,640
Yes dude. Oh I just thought of something. Okay here's a this is you can imagine there's like

290
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:50,760
somebody writing this article and posting it on Twitter okay. Okay. Here's why the Road Runner

291
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:57,800
was the best cowboy of all time. Whoa. Wow. Yeah. Do you have anything else for that I just thought

292
00:18:57,800 --> 00:19:01,960
of that? Uh I guess he didn't capture anyone though. I would say Wile E. Coyote is closer

293
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:07,640
to a cowboy well no he's more of like a Wiley coyote is a bandit through and

294
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:16,240
through I yeah no no he's he's like dastardly though I think Wiley coyote

295
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:19,960
would Wiley coyote is definitely dastardly I think now that Pat has

296
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:23,720
decided to be the cowboy I may have to become dastardly pretty soon here yeah

297
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:27,920
yep you're gonna wear like a top hat and tie a woman to the train tracks that I

298
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:32,180
save I may have to become very dastardly sooner than you might think

299
00:19:32,180 --> 00:19:36,260
dick dastardly no you could be like him you could drive a car with your little

300
00:19:36,260 --> 00:19:43,700

317
00:21:30,660 --> 00:21:36,380
came up to me and he was like, "Yo, you think I got front 180 first try?" I was

318
00:21:36,380 --> 00:21:41,500
like, "Yeah, sure man. Go ahead." And I like gave him my board and he handed me his

319
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:49,780
like phone his sandwich his drink his wallet I think you robbed him dude I

320
00:21:49,780 --> 00:21:54,740
said I think you just that's an exchange and then he like he kept making like

321
00:21:54,740 --> 00:21:59,300
excuses as to why he didn't want to do the front 180 and he was like shit my

322
00:21:59,300 --> 00:22:06,380
grandma just died yeah he just kept talking to me like about his life yeah

323
00:22:06,380 --> 00:22:10,700
about his life and then he was like man you guys are too much here skating that

324
00:22:10,700 --> 00:22:15,020
ledge and he's like all right fine then he finally did it and just like fucked it

325
00:22:15,020 --> 00:22:23,260
up so you robbed a guy and then he couldn't even do a trick well I that's

326
00:22:23,260 --> 00:22:26,820
actually a good motivator though is if you if you're like here take all my shit

327
00:22:26,820 --> 00:22:30,660
don't give it back unless I land well I dropped his phone I dropped his phone and

328
00:22:30,660 --> 00:22:34,300
then he was like you dropped his phone yeah I dropped he like handed it he had

329
00:22:34,300 --> 00:22:38,780
his phone inside of his wallet oh and then he handed it to me and then I

330
00:22:38,780 --> 00:22:42,260
dropped the phone I was like oh shit sorry man he's like no that's fine it

331
00:22:42,260 --> 00:22:49,980
doesn't even work anyway you bring it around you guys are too much you can spy

332
00:22:49,980 --> 00:22:53,740
on people you hold the phone to your face and make it look like you're doing

333
00:22:53,740 --> 00:22:57,500
something mm-hmm and then you can listen in that was it you know who that was

334
00:22:57,500 --> 00:23:03,060
Patrick who was that that was Batman whoa he had a tracking device in that

335
00:23:03,060 --> 00:23:06,220
wallet if you had taken off he would have fucked you up

336
00:23:06,220 --> 00:23:08,220
Batman just baiting people to do crimes.

337
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:10,220
I'm glad I didn't.

338
00:23:10,220 --> 00:23:13,220
He just has like a fucking fishing pole with a woman's purse on it.

339
00:23:13,220 --> 00:23:16,220
Just waiting to beat some guy up.

340
00:23:16,220 --> 00:23:18,220
He does do that, dude.

341
00:23:18,220 --> 00:23:22,220
He always shows up there like, he shows like some guy will kill someone and then he shows up and he's like,

342
00:23:22,220 --> 00:23:24,220
"Now I can get you."

343
00:23:24,220 --> 00:23:25,220
You know?

344
00:23:25,220 --> 00:23:26,220
Yeah.

345
00:23:26,220 --> 00:23:28,220
Just kill everybody right away.

346
00:23:28,220 --> 00:23:30,220
Everybody hold this dollar.

347
00:23:30,220 --> 00:23:32,220
Got your ass, you're dead.

348
00:23:32,220 --> 00:23:35,220
In Batman Returns, I watched that the other day.

349
00:23:35,220 --> 00:23:40,100
he just like Tim Burton just didn't he just Batman straight-up kills dudes in

350
00:23:40,100 --> 00:23:44,340
that movie he kills people in the Snyder cut dude it's so yeah everyone everyone

351
00:23:44,340 --> 00:23:48,180
love as always like like like once a week there's the tweet that's like um

352
00:23:48,180 --> 00:23:52,940
Batman was really rich but instead of using that money to invent socialism he

353
00:23:52,940 --> 00:23:57,700
actually beat up an evil clown and saved the city so he's a bit of a fascist I

354
00:23:57,700 --> 00:24:04,420
think but every yeah guys so annoying his parents died he's allowed to like beat

355
00:24:04,420 --> 00:24:10,460
up a schizophrenic guy if he wants to. That's fine. Also, if I was rich I'd be just so much worse. Oh yeah? I'd be a full

356
00:24:10,460 --> 00:24:19,380
serial killer if I was rich. I'd be completely, I would be as evil and and I would kill as many people as

357
00:24:19,380 --> 00:24:27,420
possible before they stopped me. I would have like a chain of H.H. Holmes style like hotels all around

358
00:24:27,420 --> 00:24:33,980
the country where I'm just fucking farming poor people. Just turn their bones into fucking gelatin.

359
00:24:33,980 --> 00:24:39,260
Yeah, yeah, it's like when you make that like villager thing in Minecraft like the villager. Yeah

360
00:24:39,260 --> 00:24:45,340
Just fucking burn them like I'm just it's just a McDonald's like meatpacking plant

361
00:24:45,340 --> 00:24:48,740
And I'm passionate and I'd be involved like the Chipotle CEO

362
00:24:48,740 --> 00:24:50,940
I'd be stopping by all the different chains

363
00:24:50,940 --> 00:24:53,540
Just making sure they have the right fucking

364
00:24:53,540 --> 00:25:01,300
blood quota and shit taking pictures and taking pictures in front of the Threshers and being like the CEO stopped by today to make

365
00:25:01,300 --> 00:25:05,320
sure everything was just like a picture of like Caleb holding a guy by like his

366
00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:10,780
shirt collar and his jeans throwing a guy into smiling yeah and then a picture

367
00:25:10,780 --> 00:25:15,340
comes out of you on safari and you killed a hippo and then everyone gets

368
00:25:15,340 --> 00:25:23,940
mad I cannot believe I'd be the most evil guy of all time oh my god I can't

369
00:25:23,940 --> 00:25:30,300
believe that dr. genocide killed a lion this is and I would yeah I mean that

370
00:25:30,300 --> 00:25:32,500
That would be why I wouldn't get in any trouble,

371
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:33,900
'cause I wouldn't pick a kind of person.

372
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:35,860
I would just kill anybody.

373
00:25:35,860 --> 00:25:36,700
- Yeah. - Yeah.

374
00:25:36,700 --> 00:25:38,660
- Like, it wouldn't matter what they look like.

375
00:25:38,660 --> 00:25:39,860
I'd just fucking kill.

376
00:25:39,860 --> 00:25:42,980
I would kill people on the street for no reason at all.

377
00:25:42,980 --> 00:25:46,300
- Well, if you throw a pile of money on them after their--

378
00:25:46,300 --> 00:25:48,020
- Yeah, exactly. - No, no, no, no, no, no.

379
00:25:48,020 --> 00:25:49,220
I paid him to do this.

380
00:25:49,220 --> 00:25:51,060
- Here's what I would do, I'd pay for the funeral.

381
00:25:51,060 --> 00:25:52,860
- Oh, okay. - That would be my move.

382
00:25:52,860 --> 00:25:54,460
And people would be like, "Well, we can't be mad."

383
00:25:54,460 --> 00:25:56,140
- Well, what if you own a funeral home,

384
00:25:56,140 --> 00:25:58,500
and that's like, you own a chain of funeral homes?

385
00:25:58,500 --> 00:26:03,500
I own a funeral home and I kill people there.

386
00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:05,420
- Yeah.

387
00:26:05,420 --> 00:26:06,260
- That might be a pretty good idea.

388
00:26:06,260 --> 00:26:08,500
- What would you imagine if you're like an inventor, right?

389
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:12,180
And you invent a brand new, no you're not for this thing,

390
00:26:12,180 --> 00:26:13,940
okay, 'cause wait, you're gonna be,

391
00:26:13,940 --> 00:26:15,380
okay, but you're gonna be in this,

392
00:26:15,380 --> 00:26:18,060
so just hang on for a second.

393
00:26:18,060 --> 00:26:20,060
That's a terrible invention, not an invention.

394
00:26:20,060 --> 00:26:20,900
- Wait, no, that's the cross.

395
00:26:20,900 --> 00:26:22,980
- Let me say this, okay?

396
00:26:22,980 --> 00:26:24,260
Imagine you're, what would you,

397
00:26:24,260 --> 00:26:26,580
if you're a, you are an inventor

398
00:26:26,580 --> 00:26:31,460
and you just invented a more efficient shredder for paper, right?

399
00:26:31,460 --> 00:26:32,460
Yeah.

400
00:26:32,460 --> 00:26:38,100
And then you get a knock on your door and Caleb comes in and he's wearing an evil tuxedo with

401
00:26:38,100 --> 00:26:45,140
pointed shoulders like a JRPG boss and he says, "Hi, I'd like to buy your patent for

402
00:26:45,140 --> 00:26:46,140
your shredder.

403
00:26:46,140 --> 00:26:48,120
By the way, can you make it giant?"

404
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:49,840
Would you say yes or no?

405
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:50,840
I would say yes.

406
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:51,840
Well, how much help would you give me?

407
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:54,680
Well, you're not, that doesn't, Caleb, you're, well you're already, you wouldn't say yes

408
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:57,140
because it wouldn't make you're the one asking the question what if you could

409
00:26:57,140 --> 00:27:00,920
say yes but there's like yes but then the guy would just be like what do you why

410
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:06,760
are you saying yes yeah exactly yes I will yes yeah that would be another one

411
00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:10,640
of the evil things I do yes that'd be another one of the evil things I do as a

412
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:14,960
rich guy so just talk for people yeah yeah and then I'd be like what they said

413
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:19,160
it the do ventriloquism that's pretty evil

414
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:24,680
control I mean it's evil control that you take over somebody yeah you're you're

415
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:30,680
you're like making people think that has been frozen

416
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:34,120
you're making people you're making people think that a puppet is talking

417
00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:40,400
you're tricking people Pat are you back hey what's going on can you hear me

418
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:46,480
yeah you there yeah okay you just cut out for a second oh I did yeah no I

419
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:49,540
I would basically run, I would do like a,

420
00:27:49,540 --> 00:27:51,060
I would do like a,

421
00:27:51,060 --> 00:27:55,240
Magic 8-Ball like every morning for like a different

422
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:57,900
like small town that I would just fucking wipe out.

423
00:27:57,900 --> 00:27:58,740
Yeah.

424
00:27:58,740 --> 00:28:00,340
Yeah, with like something really fucked up,

425
00:28:00,340 --> 00:28:02,260
like maybe like a monster truck.

426
00:28:02,260 --> 00:28:03,100
Yeah.

427
00:28:03,100 --> 00:28:04,700
And that's like what I would do is I just like run over

428
00:28:04,700 --> 00:28:05,780
shit with a monster truck.

429
00:28:05,780 --> 00:28:06,820
I'd kill anything.

430
00:28:06,820 --> 00:28:09,380
You could have like a dart board that looks like the earth

431
00:28:09,380 --> 00:28:10,780
and like where a dart hits,

432
00:28:10,780 --> 00:28:13,100
like maybe it blows up or something.

433
00:28:13,100 --> 00:28:16,020
Yeah, I just go, I just bring like a flamethrower

434
00:28:16,020 --> 00:28:18,520
and just start fucking lighting California on fire.

435
00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:20,420
That's like what I would do during the summer.

436
00:28:20,420 --> 00:28:23,180
During the winter, I'd probably like fuck a penguin.

437
00:28:23,180 --> 00:28:25,700
- It wouldn't take much to like set a wildfire

438
00:28:25,700 --> 00:28:26,700
in California.

439
00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:30,840
- Well, I'm gonna bring them much, tell you that much.

440
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:33,740
Yeah, I'm gonna fucking, I'm gonna overdo everything, dude.

441
00:28:33,740 --> 00:28:34,580
I'm gonna replace water with gasoline.

442
00:28:34,580 --> 00:28:37,420
- You're not just gonna smoke a cigarette in the woods?

443
00:28:37,420 --> 00:28:38,620
- No, dude, I'm gonna smoke a--

444
00:28:38,620 --> 00:28:42,620
- Did you ever, when you were like 14,

445
00:28:42,620 --> 00:28:45,840
well, Caleb, you smoked cigs when you were like 15, right?

446
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:51,120
No, no I was not a cig smoker until like college.

447
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:56,240
Well I used to get really scared that like I would steal like my mom's

448
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:59,320
cigarettes and then go into the woods and then I would put them out like in the

449
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:03,120
woods but then I would get really scared that like a forest fire would start.

450
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:09,840
I mean that's fair. That's a good instinct to have. That's how they happen.

451
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:13,160
See that's the kind of instinct that I would just completely lose if I got I

452
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:15,280
I don't know, $10,000.

453
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:17,960
- That's a common teenage smoker fear.

454
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:19,660
Starting a forest fire.

455
00:29:19,660 --> 00:29:22,920
- You guys are telling me you wouldn't become super villains?

456
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:24,160
- I wouldn't become a super villain,

457
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:25,400
I'd become a superhero.

458
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:26,240
- I wouldn't even become,

459
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:28,680
super villains always want like fucking,

460
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:31,320
like recycling to happen or some gay shit.

461
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:32,720
I just wanna murder. - I would do something like that.

462
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:33,800
I would do something like that,

463
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:35,160
but I would do it on a much smaller scale.

464
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:36,520
I wouldn't be, I would be like,

465
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:37,880
I would be like one of those rich people

466
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:39,940
who just kind of like doesn't have a job

467
00:29:39,940 --> 00:29:41,380
and just lives in a big house.

468
00:29:41,380 --> 00:29:44,780
I'd be like, it is anybody who crosses my path I will kill.

469
00:29:44,780 --> 00:29:45,620
I'd be the most evil.

470
00:29:45,620 --> 00:29:46,460
But I'm not gonna go out of my way.

471
00:29:46,460 --> 00:29:49,380
You know, if I see like somebody walking down the street

472
00:29:49,380 --> 00:29:51,060
that my house is on, they're dead.

473
00:29:51,060 --> 00:29:51,900
But.

474
00:29:51,900 --> 00:29:52,720
Nice.

475
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:54,100
You know, just kind of like a Bermuda Triangle,

476
00:29:54,100 --> 00:29:56,500
but just for my line of sight.

477
00:29:56,500 --> 00:29:57,700
That's pretty good too.

478
00:29:57,700 --> 00:29:58,540
I would be like, I'd be like, eat human hair.

479
00:29:58,540 --> 00:30:01,900
I'd be the most evil subway manager of all time.

480
00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:03,380
If you were rich.

481
00:30:03,380 --> 00:30:05,860
Just running a really horrible subway.

482
00:30:05,860 --> 00:30:06,700
Yep.

483
00:30:06,700 --> 00:30:07,520
Just buying a subway franchise.

484
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:09,660
I would schedule people on their birthday.

485
00:30:09,660 --> 00:30:15,700
but also like replacing all the meat with meat that looks exactly the same but it's like

486
00:30:15,700 --> 00:30:18,140
made out of Cooper's plastic or something.

487
00:30:18,140 --> 00:30:22,100
Yeah, you make the meatball sub out of the tuna sandwich.

488
00:30:22,100 --> 00:30:26,900
And you just have enough money to make any negative review disappear like the CEO can't

489
00:30:26,900 --> 00:30:27,900
even come visit.

490
00:30:27,900 --> 00:30:28,900
Like you're just completely.

491
00:30:28,900 --> 00:30:29,900
Oh man.

492
00:30:29,900 --> 00:30:32,680
I would make people come in on their day off.

493
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:36,320
You buy the copyright for Subway so you have a Subway restaurant that's technically not

494
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:38,540
part of the chain so you can do whatever you want.

495
00:30:38,540 --> 00:30:39,540
Exactly.

496
00:30:39,540 --> 00:30:44,660
try and blackmail the subway CEO with the Jared Fogle info even if it's already public

497
00:30:44,660 --> 00:30:47,580
it's like oh well if you try to shut me down I'll let something...

498
00:30:47,580 --> 00:30:48,780
your employee did this

499
00:30:48,780 --> 00:30:54,180
yeah I'll let my loose lips sink ships I'll say that much

500
00:30:54,180 --> 00:30:58,780
that's right you made all this public now I can destroy you

501
00:30:58,780 --> 00:31:04,500
we actually took a pretty big hit already I don't know why you're trying to bring this back up

502
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:10,660
up yeah I would destroy them all right cowboy insults on best - insults calm

503
00:31:10,660 --> 00:31:16,140
slash cowboy - insults check it out you know usually give out the link but I

504
00:31:16,140 --> 00:31:20,380
have to say such a simple this one we were we asked you guys to get a lot of

505
00:31:20,380 --> 00:31:24,380
hype going for this one and I have to say I saw absolutely zero yep I think

506
00:31:24,380 --> 00:31:33,380
you guys I don't say this often and I like you I've probably I'm probably the

507
00:31:33,380 --> 00:31:38,100
nicest one on the show but I'm extremely disappointed in every single one of you.

508
00:31:38,100 --> 00:31:41,420
I say this very often but you guys are subhuman.

509
00:31:41,420 --> 00:31:46,260
Mm-hmm yeah. See I I would never say that but right now I'm I'm thinking it.

510
00:31:46,260 --> 00:31:50,820
What's this the fans being absolute dog shit? Yeah must be a day that ends in Y.

511
00:31:50,820 --> 00:31:54,620
If I ever saw any of you guys in real life like if you came up to me or

512
00:31:54,620 --> 00:31:58,980
anything I would treat you like a dog with its legs stuck in a bear trap. I

513
00:31:58,980 --> 00:32:00,260
would execute you on the spot.

514
00:32:00,260 --> 00:32:04,180
- Yeah, because of this, and you would know why.

515
00:32:04,180 --> 00:32:05,580
You would know why we were doing it,

516
00:32:05,580 --> 00:32:07,180
and it's because you didn't do enough.

517
00:32:07,180 --> 00:32:08,540
- You know, and as you're bleeding out,

518
00:32:08,540 --> 00:32:11,260
I'm gonna look into your eyes and I'm gonna say,

519
00:32:11,260 --> 00:32:13,220
"Ugh, your mustache has the smell

520
00:32:13,220 --> 00:32:15,300
"a mildewed saddle blanket would have

521
00:32:15,300 --> 00:32:17,880
"if it rides 300 miles in August

522
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:20,060
"on the back of a sore horse."

523
00:32:20,060 --> 00:32:21,660
- Oh, shit! - That's right.

524
00:32:21,660 --> 00:32:24,020
- No! - These are all things

525
00:32:24,020 --> 00:32:25,980
we would say to you now,

526
00:32:25,980 --> 00:32:27,620
'cause you didn't do what we told you.

527
00:32:27,620 --> 00:32:28,620
- Wait, let me do the intro.

528
00:32:28,620 --> 00:32:29,620
Yeah, read the intro.

529
00:32:29,620 --> 00:32:33,420
Cowboys are usually known to have heavy cuss words.

530
00:32:33,420 --> 00:32:37,820
So if you are going against a cowboy, it is best to have your

531
00:32:37,820 --> 00:32:40,720
game up so you would not land a pratfall while lashing out at

532
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:41,520
your opponent.

533
00:32:41,520 --> 00:32:44,720
I'm here to help you get back at your cowboy rivals.

534
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:51,920
You can cut hard, harsh, and deep at cowboys using simple and

535
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:54,520
yet classy insults on them and they are going to remember it

536
00:32:54,520 --> 00:32:56,620
forever because of how deep they were cut.

537
00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:04,080
right wow that's really nice oh yeah I mean I mean it's just a useful resource

538
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:08,160
for people you know cuz like how often do you go up against a cowboy one or two

539
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:11,640
times a week right depending on what part of the country you live in exactly I

540
00:33:11,640 --> 00:33:14,840
mean if you're in Arizona or New Mexico I mean it's probably like three or four

541
00:33:14,840 --> 00:33:20,240
times a month yeah and New York once a day mm-hmm easy dude and he's naked -

542
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:24,320
Times Square yep I'm always having a battle that naked

543
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:33,260
cowboy. Put on some fucking clothes! Yeah. You vomit. Dude, the guy dressed as Woody from

544
00:33:33,260 --> 00:33:40,360
Toy Story that stands out on Hollywood Boulevard is gonna feel my wrath. Yeah, I'm gonna catch

545
00:33:40,360 --> 00:33:48,360
him lacking. He is an op and he will be caught lacking by me. Alright, so Cam already did

546
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:52,320
number one let's keep it let's keep it going dude all right ready here I need

547
00:33:52,320 --> 00:34:01,140
somebody to fucking just think about the fence damn it you're ugly as a burnt

548
00:34:01,140 --> 00:34:05,600

549
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:10,120

550
00:34:10,120 --> 00:34:13,400
for like one of those like like a celebrity scandal or like somebody was

551
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:16,960
mean to their wife or whatever they leak all the text messages and it's this

552
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:28,960
shit you're as ugly as a burnt boot. John Wayne's text messages to his mistress have been leaked.

553
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:35,320
You're ugly as a burnt boot. That is a cowboy's least favorite thing too, a burnt boot. That's

554
00:34:35,320 --> 00:34:42,520
pretty bad. Yeah, it doesn't feel good on your foot dude. Cowboys like raw boots. Here's

555
00:34:42,520 --> 00:34:49,680
a raw boot here's another here's another insult here you will have to chew the

556
00:34:49,680 --> 00:34:54,640
water before you can swallow it because it is too thick however it darn good

557
00:34:54,640 --> 00:34:59,080
follow this with making an ugly face

558
00:34:59,080 --> 00:35:09,000
this is more of an insult towards whatever water probably a horse yeah

559
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:15,680
yeah probably a horse that you led to water but no then it's saying the water is good

560
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:21,680
it's like they say you have to chew the water but the problem is not well they're saying

561
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:24,960
you have to chew the water but the water is good like it's the problem is not with the

562
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:32,720
water it's you yeah why is why do you have to chew the water because it is too thick why

563
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:39,960
are you getting this thick water from? The H3O. Thicket? You're drinking thicket? Is that

564
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:43,920
like a cowboy? Did cowboys come up with thicket? Well they're constantly falling

565
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:51,200
in thicket bushes. Cowboy Mio. Good point. Cowboy Mio just thickens up the water. Tobacco Mio.

566
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:57,880
Alright this one's actually pretty, this one's pretty fire dude. Yeah. I'm pretty

567
00:35:57,880 --> 00:36:05,000
sure your family tree was definitely a shrub. Wow. That's right. Whatever that means. I'm

568
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:11,560
pretty sure shrubs have a pretty big... You got a small family, pal. You're not that old.

569
00:36:11,560 --> 00:36:20,440
You don't have that many ancestors. You're a new kind of person, and you only started

570
00:36:20,440 --> 00:36:26,080
a couple decades ago. You got parents and you got grandparents and it ends there somehow.

571
00:36:26,080 --> 00:36:28,800
They never had anybody past that.

572
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:31,120
Yeah, your grandparents were orphans.

573
00:36:31,120 --> 00:36:32,120
Yep.

574
00:36:32,120 --> 00:36:35,840
Grandparents dropped off by the store.

575
00:36:35,840 --> 00:36:40,600
Nobody had no brothers nor sisters neither.

576
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:46,200
Your family tree is just a single V. There's like five guys.

577
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:52,160
And that was your family tree, you lowdown son of a bitch.

578
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:53,320
Here's another one.

579
00:36:53,320 --> 00:36:59,000
Well, when you wanna unload and clean your gun, he ain't any fit to shoot at.

580
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:00,600
Forget it, man.

581
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:03,320
That seems like it's a line from a movie.

582
00:37:03,320 --> 00:37:05,320
It's like a MF Doom rap.

583
00:37:05,320 --> 00:37:07,320
Yeah, it rhymes, too.

584
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:08,320
Hey, Caleb.

585
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:09,120
What?

586
00:37:09,120 --> 00:37:12,120
There's definitely nothing under your hat except hair.

587
00:37:12,120 --> 00:37:15,120
Uh, this guy doesn't have a hat or hair.

588
00:37:15,120 --> 00:37:17,120
I have neither. What do I have, then?

589
00:37:17,120 --> 00:37:19,120
Headphones.

590
00:37:19,120 --> 00:37:21,120
That's right.

591
00:37:21,120 --> 00:37:23,120
That's fucking right, dude.

592
00:37:23,120 --> 00:37:30,120
A hog knows more about a hip pocket in a bathing suit than you know about anything.

593
00:37:30,120 --> 00:37:34,400
There's a lot of hog insulars too, back to back.

594
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:36,880
Basically a hog was the stupidest thing you could be back then.

595
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:38,600
You know way less than a hog knows a side saddle.

596
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:42,160
And a hip pocket in a bathing suit is something so obvious that you would--

597
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:43,640
Something everybody knows about.

598
00:37:43,640 --> 00:37:46,960
Even a hog you think would know about it, but nope.

599
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:47,960
No.

600
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:51,860
mean that's it really was just like that was the that was the dumbest guy that

601
00:37:51,860 --> 00:37:57,580
you knew was an actual fucking hog back yeah hang out with I was your but you're

602
00:37:57,580 --> 00:38:02,660
you're like stupidest friend I mean the town like towns back then were like 15

603
00:38:02,660 --> 00:38:06,020
people so it's like it's so you can only go so long for you have to like be like

604
00:38:06,020 --> 00:38:09,260
well I need a new friend group I might as well hang out with like this guy's

605
00:38:09,260 --> 00:38:15,140
hogs yeah everybody had that that one hog from their hometown god forbid your

606
00:38:15,140 --> 00:38:19,580
last name was hog that would have been really really bad mm-hmm yeah it was

607
00:38:19,580 --> 00:38:22,980
back then whatever your last name is that's what you are yeah you know with

608
00:38:22,980 --> 00:38:27,300
like you know Cooper they make barrels or whatever Smith they're blacksmith hog

609
00:38:27,300 --> 00:38:36,700
you're a hog mm-hmm such a good point I know we're moving to a podcast where we

610
00:38:36,700 --> 00:38:41,860
make points now mm-hmm just so you guys know it's really bombs yeah this is my

611
00:38:41,860 --> 00:38:43,020
- It's a podcast about truth.

612
00:38:43,020 --> 00:38:44,080
- Not even necessarily truth,

613
00:38:44,080 --> 00:38:46,580
but just kind of stuff you hear and you go, hmm.

614
00:38:46,580 --> 00:38:47,780
And that is--

615
00:38:47,780 --> 00:38:49,520
- Interesting. - Intriguing.

616
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:52,700
- We're hearing intrigue more than entertain nowadays.

617
00:38:52,700 --> 00:38:54,280
- Exactly, yeah.

618
00:38:54,280 --> 00:39:00,620
- You know way less than a hog knows a side saddle.

619
00:39:00,620 --> 00:39:04,460
- Okay, so that's kind of repeating the same thing

620
00:39:04,460 --> 00:39:06,620
as earlier, I read that.

621
00:39:06,620 --> 00:39:08,020
- A hog-- - I read that one.

622
00:39:08,020 --> 00:39:11,660
I read that one while you guys were talking

623
00:39:11,660 --> 00:39:17,180
they didn't realize. I'm confused by what you're trying to say right now. Never mind.

624
00:39:17,180 --> 00:39:24,340
Yeah you're basically acting a hog right now. Oh no. Actin' a hog. A hog probably knows

625
00:39:24,340 --> 00:39:28,140
about a side saddle. Yeah. Hogs are actually, here's the fucked up part dude.

626
00:39:28,140 --> 00:39:32,940
A hog is so much smarter than a dog or a frog. He's one of the smartest hog

627
00:39:32,940 --> 00:39:37,460
animals. Absolutely. And they're pretending like hogs know nothing. Hogs

628
00:39:37,460 --> 00:39:40,900
actually have an extreme emotional intelligence. True. They're I think

629
00:39:40,900 --> 00:39:44,920
think comparable in like intelligence wise to like a two or three year old

630
00:39:44,920 --> 00:39:48,840
human being absolutely and that's intriguing yeah yeah so I don't know why

631
00:39:48,840 --> 00:39:53,140
they keep because they can speak they can you know what I'm gonna read I'll

632
00:39:53,140 --> 00:39:56,960
rewrite this I would say hogs is punching down in a huge way here's what

633
00:39:56,960 --> 00:40:01,240
I'm gonna say I say we rewrite this insult it's and it to be like this okay

634
00:40:01,240 --> 00:40:07,840
you know you know way less than a stupid person knows about knowledge that's

635
00:40:07,840 --> 00:40:08,840
That's pretty good.

636
00:40:08,840 --> 00:40:09,840
Yeah.

637
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:10,840
Because that makes it more sense.

638
00:40:10,840 --> 00:40:11,840
I could see a cowboy saying that.

639
00:40:11,840 --> 00:40:15,780
Because now we also, now we kind of have a framework that on which you could lay almost

640
00:40:15,780 --> 00:40:17,760
anything to make a cowboy insult.

641
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:18,760
Absolutely.

642
00:40:18,760 --> 00:40:24,040
Which is you know less than X about, that does not know about Y, knows about Y.

643
00:40:24,040 --> 00:40:25,040
Yeah, and X and Y.

644
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:26,040
X and Y.

645
00:40:26,040 --> 00:40:27,040
You know what I mean?

646
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:28,040
Yeah.

647
00:40:28,040 --> 00:40:31,840
So, you could say like, you know, you know.

648
00:40:31,840 --> 00:40:35,320
And I mean, if you're looking for something fascinating, X and Y, those are also used in

649
00:40:35,320 --> 00:40:36,320
algebra.

650
00:40:36,320 --> 00:40:37,320
Yep.

651
00:40:37,320 --> 00:40:40,480
Now we're kind of turning into a mathematical formula

652
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:42,800
about how to make a cowboy insult.

653
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:46,320
You could do, I mean like, all right,

654
00:40:46,320 --> 00:40:51,320
you could say, you know less than about anything

655
00:40:51,320 --> 00:40:54,840
than a chair knows about standing up.

656
00:40:54,840 --> 00:40:56,540
Right, yeah.

657
00:40:56,540 --> 00:40:58,080
Like there's one, you know?

658
00:40:58,080 --> 00:41:00,000
I mean you can just look around.

659
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,800
You know less about anything than guacamole

660
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:04,460
knows about being red.

661
00:41:04,460 --> 00:41:06,420
Oh, that's pretty good.

662
00:41:06,420 --> 00:41:09,540
can just kind of look around look what's around you and kind of just make it from

663
00:41:09,540 --> 00:41:13,500
there like like you could do like you know you know less than a hat knows

664
00:41:13,500 --> 00:41:18,100
about water bottle yeah it's easy yeah less about than a

665
00:41:18,100 --> 00:41:23,280
french fry knows it's knows what day of the week it is fucking idiot ass cowboy

666
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:27,740
see that's actually nothing the ad at the end

667
00:41:27,740 --> 00:41:37,460
cowboy with the fucking beefy haircut get a line up come correct when you're

668
00:41:37,460 --> 00:41:43,740
popping off with the saloon my boy at the saloon tonight spinning all night

669
00:41:43,740 --> 00:41:54,780
long come through you know way less than Michael knows about David just you guys

670
00:41:54,780 --> 00:41:59,340
in the room. Yeah, see if you know, if those are two guys that don't know each other and

671
00:41:59,340 --> 00:42:05,580
they're in the room that works too. Michael, meet David. See and they already know more

672
00:42:05,580 --> 00:42:09,300
about each other than you know about anything so that's kind of the point I

673
00:42:09,300 --> 00:42:13,900
was making as in this cowboy voice. Look, they're fast friends. Look at them. Look, I mean

674
00:42:13,900 --> 00:42:19,160
they're already exchanging numbers. You know less than Superman knows about

675
00:42:19,160 --> 00:42:27,040
spider-man they're from different superhero universes exactly yeah yeah

676
00:42:27,040 --> 00:42:30,440
see that's I don't know about each pretty much anything you can follow along at

677
00:42:30,440 --> 00:42:35,120
home you do your own sort of mad libs thing that we got going on yeah don't

678
00:42:35,120 --> 00:42:39,080
tell them to us cuz we're mad at you yep yeah cuz we're also pissed about the

679
00:42:39,080 --> 00:42:45,640
lack of yeah we're still we're still so mad at you yeah I am I I'll forgive you

680
00:42:45,640 --> 00:42:53,140
I'll forgive you in a week but until then if you hype up the next episode to the

681
00:42:53,140 --> 00:42:59,100
point that we want yep all right here's another one yeah forget him I just

682
00:42:59,100 --> 00:43:04,060
realized that he could not even drive nails into a snowbank I just realized

683
00:43:04,060 --> 00:43:08,100
this yeah you know forget that guy you know what I just realized randomly right

684
00:43:08,100 --> 00:43:15,900
now like right now it couldn't put a nail in us in snow I just realized it's a good

685
00:43:15,900 --> 00:43:19,900
way to start an insult because it misdirects you right yeah you don't you

686
00:43:19,900 --> 00:43:24,620
don't expect an insult to come after you expect a fact or something yeah you

687
00:43:24,620 --> 00:43:28,020
expect them to just be like I just realized I don't like this guy or so I

688
00:43:28,020 --> 00:43:34,860
just realized I left the fire on back at home I just realized that a fire truck

689
00:43:34,860 --> 00:43:40,300
ain't blue and this guy knows less about what a fire truck could know about setting a fire.

690
00:43:40,300 --> 00:43:47,660
Yep. And the cowboy, I mean that's like some... Cowboys like opposites. That's something when

691
00:43:47,660 --> 00:43:51,500
it comes to cowboy insults. That's true, yeah. It's true. Let's see. For example,

692
00:43:51,500 --> 00:43:58,380
I am pretty certain that you cannot tell wild honey from dung. That's great on a blind guy.

693
00:43:58,380 --> 00:44:03,820
That's like... Yeah. Yeah. Like if you're battling a blind cowboy. That's also good

694
00:44:03,820 --> 00:44:08,660
if there's someone nearby who has like really viscous like clear ish like

695
00:44:08,660 --> 00:44:14,500
yellow poop for example a bee a bee is a good example yeah honey is just bee poop

696
00:44:14,500 --> 00:44:19,060
yeah so really they're not that different so that's very showing his

697
00:44:19,060 --> 00:44:24,580
lack of scientific knowledge you know

698
00:44:24,580 --> 00:44:30,940
your face is as puckered as wet sheepskin would be in front of a hot

699
00:44:30,940 --> 00:44:35,980
fire bite that see this introduces a catchphrase element where at the end you

700
00:44:35,980 --> 00:44:39,820
would just say bite that bite that is a good Danny that's a really good

701
00:44:39,820 --> 00:44:45,900
catchphrase I guess yeah that's biting Danny McClintock you don't want to you

702
00:44:45,900 --> 00:44:48,340
I'm telling you you don't want to fuck it you don't want to miss with that you

703
00:44:48,340 --> 00:44:54,220
don't want to enter a word duel with him that's what they called rap battles back

704
00:44:54,220 --> 00:45:05,120
then yeah yeah yeah well me as the judge I couldn't quite make out what either one

705
00:45:05,120 --> 00:45:10,180
of them just saying they said I'm dead just about the same time but seeing all

706
00:45:10,180 --> 00:45:16,520
this one yet another draw that's our 20th in a row here's a really I couldn't

707
00:45:16,520 --> 00:45:20,820
tell exactly what they were rapping but seeing as Slim's dead and old Joe's still

708
00:45:20,820 --> 00:45:32,060
staying with the smoking gun this next one is really really something a popcorn on

709
00:45:32,060 --> 00:45:38,660
fire has more calm than you would ever have Wow I mean before the right for the

710
00:45:38,660 --> 00:45:43,700
throat I'm yeah fuck before the invention of the microwave I mean I guess

711
00:45:43,700 --> 00:45:48,500
you didn't throw popcorn on fire huh yeah also I mean telling a cowboy that he's

712
00:45:48,500 --> 00:45:55,060
not calm right yeah you got shaky hands partner yeah oh I guess that makes sense

713
00:45:55,060 --> 00:46:01,180
you're freaking out you're bugging you suffer from anxiety

714
00:46:01,180 --> 00:46:08,180
exciter we have a support group if you want to if you'd like to mosey on up

715
00:46:08,180 --> 00:46:14,260
there here's one we meet every weekend you are you know what was sick you are

716
00:46:14,260 --> 00:46:20,620
so ugly that you could back a buzzard right off a gut wagon what's a gut wagon

717
00:46:20,620 --> 00:46:29,140
wagon full of guts oh it is a wagon full of guts rephrase that into a cowboy

718
00:46:29,140 --> 00:46:33,340
insult right now because I'm not accepting a regular insult your guts

719
00:46:33,340 --> 00:46:38,260
just about a gut wagons worth a waste you no good what

720
00:46:38,260 --> 00:46:41,620
woppy willow

721
00:46:41,620 --> 00:46:42,900
retry that

722
00:46:42,900 --> 00:46:44,460
you're just about as

723
00:46:44,460 --> 00:46:46,100
that is a whole is a

724
00:46:46,100 --> 00:46:48,300
had handbag you

725
00:46:48,300 --> 00:46:51,080
you carry home

726
00:46:51,080 --> 00:46:55,980
rephrase that again your your good must need we don't have any idea yet

727
00:46:55,980 --> 00:46:59,300
not just throwing it out here in the middle fee mario

728
00:46:59,300 --> 00:47:01,460
it's a good idea to do it

729
00:47:01,460 --> 00:47:04,700
you missed in my ear

730
00:47:04,700 --> 00:47:07,180
you know what he did but i think the alliteration in that one

731
00:47:07,180 --> 00:47:10,620
I think that's a big thing with cowboy insults too is alliteration.

732
00:47:10,620 --> 00:47:12,420
Yeah, absolutely.

733
00:47:12,420 --> 00:47:16,380
Like for this one here has some good alliteration.

734
00:47:16,380 --> 00:47:24,060
Even if you had as many as three throws, that's the alliteration, you cannot hit the ground

735
00:47:24,060 --> 00:47:25,060
with your hat.

736
00:47:25,060 --> 00:47:26,060
Wow.

737
00:47:26,060 --> 00:47:27,060
What does that mean?

738
00:47:27,060 --> 00:47:28,540
It means you can't hoop, dude.

739
00:47:28,540 --> 00:47:30,980
No, it means you have an infinite throw.

740
00:47:30,980 --> 00:47:32,580
This guy can't hit three throws.

741
00:47:32,580 --> 00:47:35,180
You could throw the hat out of orbit right away.

742
00:47:35,180 --> 00:47:36,180
True.

743
00:47:36,180 --> 00:47:42,660
every time you have a zero gravity hat mm-hmm damn yeah and it just keeps on

744
00:47:42,660 --> 00:47:46,900
flying yeah you know what it means it means you live in space no ground space

745
00:47:46,900 --> 00:47:53,020
cowboy oh shit oh shit oh my gosh I should make a TV show out of that mm-hmm

746
00:47:53,020 --> 00:47:58,540
this is good you know what it means jazz this next one is good the one after that

747
00:47:58,540 --> 00:48:04,180
I think is my favorite one so far me too section is uh you you have to sneak up

748
00:48:04,180 --> 00:48:08,620
on a dipper just to get a drink of water only because of your ugliness

749
00:48:08,620 --> 00:48:11,180
why do you have to sneak up on the dipper?

750
00:48:11,180 --> 00:48:12,180
because you're so ugly

751
00:48:12,180 --> 00:48:13,180
like a spoon?

752
00:48:13,180 --> 00:48:15,180
I think a dipper is like a well type thing

753
00:48:15,180 --> 00:48:17,180
oh yeah the

754
00:48:17,180 --> 00:48:21,180
yeah and you have to sneak up on it because it would run away because you're ugly

755
00:48:21,180 --> 00:48:22,180
mm-hmm

756
00:48:22,180 --> 00:48:24,180
Pat read this next one for us

757
00:48:24,180 --> 00:48:25,180
alright

758
00:48:25,180 --> 00:48:26,180
I think you're gonna like this one

759
00:48:26,180 --> 00:48:27,180
the best one so far

760
00:48:27,180 --> 00:48:29,180
you are so mean

761
00:48:29,180 --> 00:48:33,180
*laughter*

762
00:48:33,180 --> 00:48:34,940
Just giving up dude.

763
00:48:34,940 --> 00:48:35,940
Yeah.

764
00:48:35,940 --> 00:48:36,940
Come on.

765
00:48:36,940 --> 00:48:37,940
That's it.

766
00:48:37,940 --> 00:48:41,620
I mean, how is that going to be effective towards a cold-blooded cowpoke?

767
00:48:41,620 --> 00:48:44,540
Yeah, that's a comeback is what that is.

768
00:48:44,540 --> 00:48:45,540
Yeah, exactly.

769
00:48:45,540 --> 00:48:46,540
That's a finisher.

770
00:48:46,540 --> 00:48:47,540
Yeah, roasted.

771
00:48:47,540 --> 00:48:48,540
You are so mean.

772
00:48:48,540 --> 00:48:49,540
Just destroyed.

773
00:48:49,540 --> 00:48:50,540
Bodied.

774
00:48:50,540 --> 00:48:54,420
Here, we have another set of two here.

775
00:48:54,420 --> 00:48:57,300
These next two kind of go together, I feel like.

776
00:48:57,300 --> 00:48:58,300
Okay.

777
00:48:58,300 --> 00:49:03,180
sure you would give the rattler the first bite if you were in a fight with it.

778
00:49:03,180 --> 00:49:08,660
Okay. The rattler is just a guy that lived in the town. Yeah. He's a guy who ran

779
00:49:08,660 --> 00:49:12,620
around with two maracas and... And then the other one kind of copying that

780
00:49:12,620 --> 00:49:19,420
one. "You are so mean that you could dine in the same dish with a snake." See that

781
00:49:19,420 --> 00:49:25,500
also just says "you are so mean" at the beginning. Why? A cowboy's supposed to be

782
00:49:25,500 --> 00:49:29,880
mean dude yeah I don't get this angle well that's what well that's the kind of

783
00:49:29,880 --> 00:49:33,920
insult that doesn't hurt them like on the surface but they go home and they

784
00:49:33,920 --> 00:49:38,240
think about that around the fire I changed my ways maybe I'm just a mean

785
00:49:38,240 --> 00:49:43,400
guy yeah fuck maybe I should just be a hog

786
00:49:44,800 --> 00:49:55,480
here's a you should be hired as a scarecrows in farms see that one's pretty

787
00:49:55,480 --> 00:50:03,960
good yeah exactly you're so fat that you you could be multiple scarecrows in

788
00:50:03,960 --> 00:50:10,760
multiple farms yeah across the state from each other just just stretch so wide you

789
00:50:10,760 --> 00:50:15,440
covered farms from sea to shining sea. There's so many of you that you could be

790
00:50:15,440 --> 00:50:22,280
multiple scarecrows. This is another kind of simple short sweet one.

791
00:50:22,280 --> 00:50:30,560
You are crooked. I really like this next one too, another crooked one. Yeah. With

792
00:50:30,560 --> 00:50:38,880
how crooked you are you could swallow nails and spit corkscrews. Errwha. That's what I used to say.

793
00:50:38,880 --> 00:50:47,140
it's old English for you. Yeah it says ERW at the end of that one. He had a nerve to say the beans

794
00:50:47,140 --> 00:50:53,160
was deceitful because they would talk behind your back. Fuck I hate the beans. Who are the beans?

795
00:50:53,160 --> 00:50:58,960
Fuck dude you know the beans. Because the beans make you fart dude that you talk behind your back. The beans is the powers of the beans.

796
00:50:58,960 --> 00:51:06,240
Here's the next the next one is is also bean themed. Okay. Even a beans would be more modest

797
00:51:06,240 --> 00:51:15,600
honest than you god damn it I hate the beans oh man a bug dude not a beans do

798
00:51:15,600 --> 00:51:19,440
when you're a cat when your cowboy fucking making you're doing your beat

799
00:51:19,440 --> 00:51:25,680
and you see the beans dude fucking six shots straight that's right yeah it's on

800
00:51:25,680 --> 00:51:32,800

now yeah okay terrapin is a station it's a turtle they they once needed to throw a

820
00:53:30,040 --> 00:53:35,760
diamond hitch just to keep him in the saddle yeah that is how fat he is that

821
00:53:35,760 --> 00:53:38,920
one includes a second line that you can turn and say if there's someone standing

822
00:53:38,920 --> 00:53:43,280
next to you yeah which the other insults don't usually do so that's nice which is

823
00:53:43,280 --> 00:53:46,520
true you'd have it if you have your deputy with you exactly yeah so you could

824
00:53:46,520 --> 00:53:50,120
say the insult and then you can turn and say yeah that's because he's stupid yeah

825
00:53:50,120 --> 00:53:52,120
Yeah, that's 'cause of how fat he is.

826
00:53:52,120 --> 00:53:54,120
That's why I said all that crap.

827
00:53:54,120 --> 00:53:56,120
That's why I'm being mean.

828
00:53:56,120 --> 00:53:58,120
Here in the wild west.

829
00:53:58,120 --> 00:54:00,120
That's why I'm being mean to him.

830
00:54:00,120 --> 00:54:02,120
Yeah.

831
00:54:02,120 --> 00:54:07,120
Even molasses would not run down your legs because of your laziness.

832
00:54:07,120 --> 00:54:10,120
It'd just stick in your butt.

833
00:54:10,120 --> 00:54:12,120
That's the molasses that's lazy, not you.

834
00:54:12,120 --> 00:54:14,120
Yeah, that's exactly.

835
00:54:14,120 --> 00:54:15,120
Here's one.

836
00:54:15,120 --> 00:54:17,120
How lazy is this fucking molasses?

837
00:54:17,120 --> 00:54:24,240
"The way you grit your teeth, one would think that you are capable to biting sights off a six-gun."

838
00:54:24,240 --> 00:54:26,940
Oh, I thought it was, uh...

839
00:54:26,940 --> 00:54:32,620
And then the deputy would be like, "Yeah! Yeah, that's because of how the way he grits his teeth."

840
00:54:32,620 --> 00:54:36,500
"He's got bad... teeth or some..."

841
00:54:36,500 --> 00:54:38,840
"He's got no job in his sleep."

842
00:54:38,840 --> 00:54:40,840
I don't know what the insult is supposed to be saying here.

843
00:54:40,840 --> 00:54:44,360
"Honestly, these cowboy insults are kinda bad."

844
00:54:44,360 --> 00:54:45,880
There's, uh...

845
00:54:45,880 --> 00:54:53,000
I just moved to the wild west and I don't quite understand these yet. I'm from Maine.

846
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:58,640
So I just realized that the ones we were all just reading are under the heading "the best

847
00:54:58,640 --> 00:55:02,620
cowboy insults" so those are all the best ones and then there's a second heading that's

848
00:55:02,620 --> 00:55:06,600
even more cowboy insults. So those were all the good ones. These ones...

849
00:55:06,600 --> 00:55:07,900
Yeah, of course they were.

850
00:55:07,900 --> 00:55:08,900
Are not as good.

851
00:55:08,900 --> 00:55:13,220
So these are the kind of medium cowboy insults. Alright.

852
00:55:13,220 --> 00:55:16,860
are a little more poetic yeah yeah a little more situational you know what I

853
00:55:16,860 --> 00:55:20,380
think I kind of like the from just looking at these ones I think I kind of

854
00:55:20,380 --> 00:55:24,180
like these ones better these are the British villain who lives in the West

855
00:55:24,180 --> 00:55:29,260
for some reason and is like an oil baron yeah why are you not as crooked as the

856
00:55:29,260 --> 00:55:34,620
snake would be in a cactus path see that makes sense yeah would it shock you to

857
00:55:34,620 --> 00:55:38,860
realize that your brain cavity would not make a drinking cup for canary birds I

858
00:55:38,860 --> 00:55:41,100
I bet it would not because you already know.

859
00:55:41,100 --> 00:55:42,100
Ha ha.

860
00:55:42,100 --> 00:55:44,540
That's actually crazy how much better that works.

861
00:55:44,540 --> 00:55:45,820
I know.

862
00:55:45,820 --> 00:55:48,220
These ones are good.

863
00:55:48,220 --> 00:55:49,820
These are good in that voice.

864
00:55:49,820 --> 00:55:53,300
I would bet your cows reason better than you.

865
00:55:53,300 --> 00:55:57,980
See, these are words a cowboy would just never fucking use.

866
00:55:57,980 --> 00:55:58,980
Right, absolutely.

867
00:55:58,980 --> 00:56:00,700
Reason, brain cavity.

868
00:56:00,700 --> 00:56:01,700
Right.

869
00:56:01,700 --> 00:56:03,140
No way, dude.

870
00:56:03,140 --> 00:56:04,360
Cowboys are stupid.

871
00:56:04,360 --> 00:56:09,240
how you think I fear your cows control you?

872
00:56:09,240 --> 00:56:15,240
I fear your cows control you.

873
00:56:15,240 --> 00:56:18,920
Is it me or does someone moo around here?

874
00:56:18,920 --> 00:56:20,920
Okay so whoever...

875
00:56:20,920 --> 00:56:24,920
Wait these are all cows!

876
00:56:24,920 --> 00:56:28,280
It is no surprising if you have behaved like cows.

877
00:56:28,280 --> 00:56:31,280
You eat and sleep with them.

878
00:56:31,280 --> 00:56:37,400
the next one they accidentally included. They were just hanging out with a guy in a huge

879
00:56:37,400 --> 00:56:41,080
like field full of cows and they were just writing down everything he said and they accidentally

880
00:56:41,080 --> 00:56:47,320
wrote this one down instead of an insult. "Whoa, careful, a cow is passing."

881
00:56:47,320 --> 00:56:54,680
Dude, these are way better. What the fuck? Yeah, really good.

882
00:56:54,680 --> 00:56:58,760
These are sca- Alright, I'm going to try one in a cowboy accent. I do think we need to at

883
00:56:58,760 --> 00:57:05,180
at least try to do on a cowboy accent mm-hmm I'm sure your cows reduced in

884
00:57:05,180 --> 00:57:11,580
number by one return to them well now let's compare it right okay yeah okay I'll

885
00:57:11,580 --> 00:57:17,960
do it and down do it in the I am sure cows reduced in number by one return to

886
00:57:17,960 --> 00:57:29,220
them see okay now I'm confused maybe try Jamaican okay whoa I am sure your cows

887
00:57:29,220 --> 00:57:36,920
reduce the number of them seeing like this next one mentions evolution a cow

888
00:57:36,920 --> 00:57:41,160
cowboy can't this one boy is never heard of evolution it also didn't believe it

889
00:57:41,160 --> 00:57:43,960
this could you could also do these a nerd like you could do it like this

890
00:57:43,960 --> 00:57:48,680
Whoever thought evolution could not go the other way around just needs to meet you and

891
00:57:48,680 --> 00:57:49,680
think otherwise.

892
00:57:49,680 --> 00:57:50,680
Damn.

893
00:57:50,680 --> 00:57:52,320
The other way around?

894
00:57:52,320 --> 00:57:56,920
So you went this, that's if you're talking to like a newt.

895
00:57:56,920 --> 00:57:57,920
You know?

896
00:57:57,920 --> 00:57:59,800
Yeah, if you're talking to an amoeba or something.

897
00:57:59,800 --> 00:58:00,800
That's really good.

898
00:58:00,800 --> 00:58:06,120
Yeah, a very like simple kind of water based creature.

899
00:58:06,120 --> 00:58:07,920
You could say that one too.

900
00:58:07,920 --> 00:58:09,520
You say it wrapped all the way back around.

901
00:58:09,520 --> 00:58:12,280
You went all the way to alien and then you came back around.

902
00:58:12,280 --> 00:58:15,960
If you're a nerd and you're talking to a water creature, just keep that one in the back of

903
00:58:15,960 --> 00:58:16,960
your head.

904
00:58:16,960 --> 00:58:19,360
I wonder if they have a nerd insults on this website.

905
00:58:19,360 --> 00:58:21,240
We'll have to come back to this website.

906
00:58:21,240 --> 00:58:22,240
This is the best insults.

907
00:58:22,240 --> 00:58:23,240
I mean, who would have thought?

908
00:58:23,240 --> 00:58:27,040
Come on, we gotta finish it out here.

909
00:58:27,040 --> 00:58:30,240
Cows must think you are stupid.

910
00:58:30,240 --> 00:58:32,080
I can see a cowboy saying that one though.

911
00:58:32,080 --> 00:58:33,080
That's true.

912
00:58:33,080 --> 00:58:34,880
Cows must think you're stupid.

913
00:58:34,880 --> 00:58:35,880
That is good.

914
00:58:35,880 --> 00:58:42,080
Someone bathes in dung.

915
00:58:42,080 --> 00:58:50,520
is bass it's not bass it's bass. Some of them be baffin' and dung. Is it me or does it smell

916
00:58:50,520 --> 00:58:59,800
like cows around here? Something is totally cow. They were hanging out with the British guy who was

917
00:58:59,800 --> 00:59:08,960
seeing cows for the first time. You're a cowboy right? Yes I am. Yes I love cows.

918
00:59:08,960 --> 00:59:14,360
I have this assignment for WordPress and I need to finish it.

919
00:59:14,360 --> 00:59:20,720
Hi I'm a blogger I work for wordpress.com just want to get some cowboy insults out

920
00:59:20,720 --> 00:59:31,160
of you. You said cow insults yes? Yeah cowboy insults. Your utters are as short as can be.

921
00:59:31,160 --> 00:59:35,840
Yeah that works that's a cowboy insult we'll take that. Yeah it's like a boy cow.

922
00:59:35,840 --> 00:59:42,760
one of those those those BuzzFeed videos that's like like Pakistani tribesmen try

923
00:59:42,760 --> 00:59:47,120
monster energy for the first time but it's like a British fop sees a cow for

924
00:59:47,120 --> 00:59:50,640
the first time and he's just sitting there just thinks it's a guy they're

925
00:59:50,640 --> 00:59:57,680
going even your cows might wonder how you managed to own them this last one is the

926
00:59:57,680 --> 01:00:02,640
same as the the one you just read no it's not I bet your cows control

927
01:00:02,640 --> 01:00:06,520
themselves yeah that's like that's a good one though that's just that's kind of I

928
01:00:06,520 --> 01:00:10,200
would say that's more of a of a compliment that's like saying you have

929
01:00:10,200 --> 01:00:14,480
smart cows your cows are so smart and you've raised some of the smartest cows

930
01:00:14,480 --> 01:00:17,760
you asshole you don't want smart cows and then you turn around and talk to

931
01:00:17,760 --> 01:00:23,720
your deputy yeah I said that cuz he had smart cows and everybody goes yeah good

932
01:00:23,720 --> 01:00:25,720
Right, good work boss.

933
01:00:25,720 --> 01:00:27,720
Yeah, good one boss.

934
01:00:27,720 --> 01:00:29,720
Well, back to dirt farming.

935
01:00:29,720 --> 01:00:34,720
Alright, that's the end of cowboy insults.

936
01:00:34,720 --> 01:00:37,720
Again, we're bummed out that there was no hype.

937
01:00:37,720 --> 01:00:39,720
Yeah, and it's all your fault.

938
01:00:39,720 --> 01:00:41,720
You're going to eat your words when you listen to this one.

939
01:00:41,720 --> 01:00:42,720

Goddamn, I'm about to squirt.

954
01:01:20,940 --> 01:01:23,940
You see, there's two types of people in this world.

955
01:01:23,940 --> 01:01:26,440
There's them that squirts and them that gets squirted.

956
01:01:26,440 --> 01:01:27,440
That's right.

957
01:01:27,440 --> 01:01:29,940
Do you have a target for me to squirt on?

01:01:29,940 --> 01:01:33,440
Oh, so I can squirt 300 yards out.
