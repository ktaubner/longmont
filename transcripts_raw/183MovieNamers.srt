1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:14,940
I think in action, okay, so today we have you have water in a Gatorade water

2
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:19,960
in a Gator, I got water in a Fiji and and a coffee, which I have learned. I'm

3
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:29,400
a pretty often a two beverage user user. I see the thing is I will have a drink

4
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:33,040
but I'll have it on my walk over most of the time.

5
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:36,400
He is the weasel. I will have no drink

6
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:42,000
on set because if I had a drink you guys would hear me slurping all episodes.

7
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,800
It's because it's a technique thing. You have a

8
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:48,080
poor drinking technique. Oh yeah. I have a terrible drinking technique.

9
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:51,520
What do you do? What I do is I do this. I binge drink. Test it on this.

10
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:55,280
I binge drink pretty much everything. Show the people. No I'm not drinking any caffeine anymore.

11
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:59,360
I had a prime blue raspberry. It's not even a sip of coffee that would be too much.

12
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:04,960
A sip of coffee would turn, I think the whole world around me would slow down.

13
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:05,960
That's kind of what you want though.

14
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:09,160
No, the whole world I'd be in bullet time, like over the hedge.

15
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:10,160
You'd be like over the hedge, yeah.

16
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:11,360
Yeah, I'd be exactly like over the hedge.

17
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:15,040
Do you guys ever feel like living in the United States of America is the real bullet time?

18
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:16,040
Yep.

19
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:17,040
Oh.

20
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:24,240
See, if they wanted to switch to video, if they wanted to really, like, if they wanted

21
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:28,480
to make a spreadsheet of something, all of our damn hats.

22
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:36,820
So somebody just yeah, somebody made a if our if our the only employee that he has to do

23
00:01:36,820 --> 00:01:40,280
one thing every day and he's not it is one thing we do.

24
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:44,400
We do be able to pull it up for us. He's the one that present. He showed us this. He's

25
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:49,300
completely gone. Yeah, he sent us this. This is somebody made a let me see what their name

26
00:01:49,300 --> 00:01:55,680
is. I'll give them credit. Bobby Brown bail bonds. He is on strike two of not showing

27
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:59,120
coming up to maybe he's on strike. Did you guys consider that? Oh my God, I

28
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:03,240
might not even consider that for what camera switcher strike. Have you not

29
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:07,920
heard there's a camera switcher strike going on really? Yeah, it's him and like

30
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:12,120
two other people. He works for the WGA and the Wimps Guild of America. That's

31
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:17,120
right. Yeah, the Wimps and Girls of America. Yeah, so it looks like so

32
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:18,160
somebody made a

33
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:25,400
spreadsheet that has the beverages of every episode that we've done on video

34
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:29,820
shows the beverage. So this will be one for Gatorade for for so yeah, that's I

35
00:02:29,820 --> 00:02:32,880
guess I wanted this is something I did want to address. I'll let you complete

36
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:37,480
talk about what this is, but I am I do I will need to clear the air. Okay,

37
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:42,800
go ahead, go okay. No, you go ahead. Okay, so what I would like to say off

38
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:43,760
the bat is that I

39
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:50,760
am just like a madman with my beverage choices. I've always yeah, I have known

40
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:55,360
that I kind of I always noticed that you would love to bring a cup of coffee.

41
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:59,960
Well, I like bring it like this. Yeah, and I do like walking around

42
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:04,240
holding the coffee from the top already a spill right here and guess that's not

43
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:08,440
that well you because I don't fucking sit there in the middle asshole. No, you

44
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:12,640
spilled that, but I do like walking in like this. I feel you know what it is. I

45
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:16,120
feel like I like feeling like I'm going to work. So I like feeling like this is

46
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:20,280
like when I used to have a like an office job. This is how I would show up.

47
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:29,320
I've never had an office job, so I drink when I'm going to work. I'm pounding back like a 200 milligram caffeine thing.

48
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:37,320
For me, an office job means taking a K-cup and drinking five or six K-cups to take away their K-cups.

49
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:39,320
Me, I'm so fucked up from not sleeping the night before.

50
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:42,320
Shotgunning a monster on my way to work.

51
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:45,320
Eating the cream, drinking the creams.

52
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:49,120
yeah. Oh, we need to get we need to get some of those cream so that we can get

53
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:51,120
those creams, those creams, those

54
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:55,880
you remember one time we had that rancid tea. We should get that. Oh yeah,

55
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:59,560
one time me and Cameron at our old job. We had we made we submitted all the

56
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:05,200
time and we made this tea and it was only time I've ever seen spoiled tea.

57
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:08,880
It was completely rancid and then we tried and then I like we made and like

58
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:13,640
we could smell the tea bag and tell it was like rancid. Then you look it up in

59
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:17,800
every single review of the it was like fifty fifty. It was like there's some

60
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:22,080
type of tea where like it's like a yeah you half the time it completely goes

61
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:23,400
bad and it tastes like

62
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:28,040
vomit yeah. Do you remember when there was the controversy in our old office

63
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:31,480
about blueberry? I do remember the blueberry. There was a very coffee.

64
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:35,360
There was a controversy of what a fuck they bought our old office because

65
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:40,000
somebody bought a variety pack, a cura cake up a blue mountain or green

66
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:41,400
blue bound coffee variety,

67
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:44,700
yeah and it was and it had

68
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:48,300
like yeah. It was like you know, like it was like every flavor like breakfast

69
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:50,200
blend, dark roast, light roast,

70
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:54,840
yeah it was three. It was those three and then blueberry and the blue berry

71
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:58,720
one. When you turned it on on the cake up, it smelled like a diaper yeah,

72
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:04,440
smelled like it filled the entire office with entire office. I'd never had it. I

73
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:08,360
started drinking it because I eventually got got brought over, but we had this

74
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:12,700
same guy that we worked with who would miss him. I miss him so much. He was the

75
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:17,540
best guy ever. He really was. I actually love him, but he would I remember this

76
00:05:17,540 --> 00:05:22,300
dude yeah. He would like when everybody started saying like oh God, that coffee

77
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:25,840
smells terrible. He started being like I actually like it yeah and started

78
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:29,080
making it every single day. How I remember it was like everyone was like

79
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:33,040
God that smells horrible, like who's even having this and then like and we

80
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:35,800
like didn't know who it was like who was drinking it all the time because we

81
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:38,800
come in, it would smell like blueberry and one time seeing him making it and

82
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:41,160
be like yeah, you're the one who's been making the blueberries like yeah. I

83
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:45,320
love it yeah and then he kind of just leaned into it more because we hated it

84
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:48,860
and we and but then eventually we ran out of every other kind of coffee and so

85
00:05:48,860 --> 00:05:52,400
here I am sitting there making the blueberry coffee right kind of just like

86
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:55,760
and the first time I was what am I going to do go to Starbucks? Fuck no,

87
00:05:55,760 --> 00:06:00,640
I was broke, don't get donuts right next to the whole reason why I liked that

88
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:03,600
job was that I could get free coffee, free coffee, free food all the time.

89
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:06,560
you get to work an event and you just take all yeah. We used to have to go

90
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:11,180
like I mean that's what I I depended on that yeah on every other day.

91
00:06:11,180 --> 00:06:14,520
Basically, I would have to go and film you get some kind of a set up like a

92
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:18,760
P a system. No, it's just a little that was the only only time until like this

93
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:22,760
year that I ever had a lobster roll. Yeah, I would always feel like a cat

94
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:25,760
that they were like giving scratch to at the end of the event. That's how they

95
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:30,100
like that's how they would lick my lips and look at like sixteen grapes that

96
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:33,400
they had like left over that were all the like bad. Well, that's how they'd

97
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:35,980
spokesy to do those jobs, because no one would want to do it, because it was you

98
00:06:35,980 --> 00:06:38,660
would have to sit in a room for an hour and a half and film the most boring

99
00:06:38,660 --> 00:06:41,960
presentation of all yeah, but like our boss would send out emails or the

100
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:46,220
subject line, which is like a hundred dollars and then like in the body of

101
00:06:46,220 --> 00:06:49,820
you like if you work this event, they're going to give you food. Yeah, you get

102
00:06:49,820 --> 00:06:50,960
ten bucks an hour plus

103
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:57,300
I'm fucking there, and it would be a mad dash to reply to the email first and

104
00:06:57,300 --> 00:07:01,520
say I can do that yeah skipping class to do yeah literally. I would do that all

105
00:07:01,540 --> 00:07:05,540
every time I'd skip it, I would skip anything to get like and I would do I

106
00:07:05,540 --> 00:07:10,700
would take I would take the leftovers yeah like I would just hope to God that

107
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:14,780
everybody would leave the room before taking the leftovers and assume that I

108
00:07:14,780 --> 00:07:18,100
was going to clean it up and then I was put it in my backpack. So I'd go home

109
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:22,440
with like ten turkey sandwiches. Truly, I did that in high school, though I did

110
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:27,020
that. I would work these like events. I would like go there's this guy. I forget

111
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:34,640
name but I worked for him and my job was videographer and I would just go and I would record like

112
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:38,760
all school assemblies for the elementary school and stuff like that. So I would just be skipping

113
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:45,180
like, it's a, it's, I'm amazed that I graduated high school because I skipped so many classes

114
00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:51,260
just to go do like, it's like, oh I'm sorry I have to go take this Sony Handycam and film

115
00:07:51,260 --> 00:07:56,320
like the first graders choir assembly. You liked it. Yeah. I would get free sandwiches

116
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:58,320
and then he would take me to Walmart after.

117
00:07:58,320 --> 00:08:00,560
As like a reward?

118
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:01,760
No, he just needed to go.

119
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:08,040
My job, my other job in high school was videographer for the

120
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:09,680
football coach.

121
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:11,640
His personal videographer.

122
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:12,680
Yeah.

123
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:14,840
Around the house.

124
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:17,480
Can you take a video to show my wife how to watch this?

125
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:18,480
Like Brian.

126
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:22,480
Following around Joe Rogan, taking videos of everything he does.

127
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:23,600
You were doing his blog.

128
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:24,840
Yeah, pretty much.

129
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:32,980
They would make me stand in this little fucking thing on top of like next to where the announcers were for the football game.

130
00:08:32,980 --> 00:08:34,540
So I just stand up there with a camera.

131
00:08:34,540 --> 00:08:37,900
And if I like missed a shot like you get really mad at me.

132
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:41,580
But I had to like he was like all right you record once the whistle starts.

133
00:08:41,580 --> 00:08:45,980
So I had to like record every single fucking play.

134
00:08:45,980 --> 00:08:49,340
So he would have like a playback thing the whole game the whole game.

135
00:08:49,340 --> 00:08:51,300
But he didn't have like a good enough camera.

136
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:52,460
He didn't have a good enough camera.

137
00:08:52,460 --> 00:08:57,260
so all the footage is like like so you know, like they have the digital zooms

138
00:08:57,260 --> 00:09:03,220
on those cameras, all digital zoom yeah. So I just like blurriest fucking

139
00:09:03,220 --> 00:09:05,820
because I couldn't let you near the field because you'd scream. Yeah, I

140
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:08,960
would be screaming. Yeah, I would be I'd be

141
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:10,940
I'd be

142
00:09:10,940 --> 00:09:13,700
jumping over

143
00:09:19,540 --> 00:09:23,900
Okay, I need to clear the air. If I was oh, wait, I need to clear the air.

144
00:09:23,900 --> 00:09:28,540
Somebody this is weighing on me, this chart that this person made. I didn't

145
00:09:28,540 --> 00:09:33,100
count, but they put a whole lot of entries for Gatorade. They did a whole

146
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:35,940
lot of Gatorade. And specifically, they put Gatorade and the flavor or the

147
00:09:35,940 --> 00:09:39,740
color or whatever of Gatorade. At least 50% of those,

148
00:09:39,740 --> 00:09:45,220
that's water in a Gatorade bottle. Fuck me. And I feel like, okay, I'm not

149
00:09:45,220 --> 00:09:48,900
gonna, I mean, I'm not gonna say like, okay, you have to be zooming in on

150
00:09:48,900 --> 00:09:51,500
this video, but I feel like you can tell the difference between water and

151
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:55,380
Gatorade. What if it's a Gatorade Zero? I honestly, I can't tell. It's not

152
00:09:55,380 --> 00:09:58,220
Gatorade Zero, 'cause they wrote the flavor 'cause they look at the bottle.

153
00:09:58,220 --> 00:10:00,500
Gatorade. You could be pouring Propel into your Gatorade bottle. What if it's

154
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:03,820
Gatorade Zero color? They also put, they said on the thing, they said,

155
00:10:03,820 --> 00:10:07,940
like, "No, some of those Gatorades could be water in a Gatorade bottle."

156
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:10,900
So they knew. So they knew, but they still... They had a hunch. But they

157
00:10:10,900 --> 00:10:13,740
still made it look like I drank a Gatorade every single day. And I'd like

158
00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:16,340
to say, pretty much every time that I had a Solo cup, which there's a

159
00:10:16,340 --> 00:10:19,900
lot of solo cup. That was water. I'm a water drinker out of the solo. We still

160
00:10:19,900 --> 00:10:23,940
have really solo cups at the old office. I drink water. I had no drinks pretty

161
00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:27,260
much. That's not true. You had a lot of drinks. I had a good chunk of drinks,

162
00:10:27,260 --> 00:10:32,100
but I thought, as soon as Jubio sent me that and it said list of drinks,

163
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:33,300
I was like, "Okay,

164
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:38,220
I am gonna have a revelation about how much soda I drink." So I'd like to...

165
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:42,500
And then I realized, "Oh yeah, no, I'm not drinking as much soda as I

166
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:50,800
I'd like to defend myself. I am somebody who is easily parched. I have a

167
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:55,140
parchable mouth. I have a salad. The number one way to get I think I might

168
00:10:55,140 --> 00:10:59,540
have coffee. I might have type two diabetes. Yeah, well, sometimes I think

169
00:10:59,540 --> 00:11:02,820
that because I pee pretty much once an hour. Yeah, I think that too. I

170
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:05,700
probably because of diabetes. It's probably because all the things you're

171
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:09,500
drinking, but I want to drink those things. So what does that say

172
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:11,600
that you're thirsty.

173
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:12,600
So why am I thirsty?

174
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:13,600
Probably because I have a fucking deadly disease.

175
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:18,320
It might be a kidney problem, not type 2 diabetes.

176
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:19,320
You could be.

177
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:20,320
Diabetes is a kidney problem.

178
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:21,320
You could be.

179
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:22,320
It is a kidney problem.

180
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:23,320
Okay.

181
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:24,320
I thought it was a pancreatic problem.

182
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:25,320
Nope, it's kidneys.

183
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:26,320
Alright.

184
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:31,120
I was going to say we could have like a whole like fundraiser to get you on dialysis or

185
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:32,120
something.

186
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:33,120
I don't need.

187
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:34,120
I'm not dying yet.

188
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:35,120
He's dying.

189
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:36,280
I'm not dying yet.

190
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:41,880
from what I've known him for four years now, five years, every single day he

191
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:49,560
tells me I just shit liquid, like black liquid. I think my insides are failing.

192
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:53,480
I don't say any of this. I didn't shit. I've had normal shits recently. My shits

193
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:57,040
have been perfect. As long as I've known you, every single day you tell me

194
00:11:57,040 --> 00:12:01,680
something like, "I think this is it. I think this is the big one. I think I'm

195
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:05,640
done." That's not true. That's what I say. That's what he says. He says he's

196
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:10,760
always having he has he has diarrhea, but he like likes it. He likes to tell

197
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:12,140
everyone he's like he loves

198
00:12:12,140 --> 00:12:13,840
a little

199
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:18,640
come out of the bathroom when you go. I just had a diarrhea. Well, because I

200
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:21,600
feel like allergies and then you're okay. Here's the thing about diarrhea

201
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:26,720
because I can't breathe. That's why that noise is I diarrhea in the work toilet.

202
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:30,920
It's best you guys hear it for me. We hear it from you before you say a word

203
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:37,440
Hey, hold now hold on no no a hundred percent you are you. I think I hate to

204
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:42,800
say it what you are the loudest shitter. Oh, there's no doubt every time that

205
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:45,500
every time that you would go to the bathroom at the old office, you just

206
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:45,800
hear

207
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:53,120
it's like somebody let go of a fucking balloon. Yeah, see I always was like

208
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:55,800
what's going on when you do that with the balloon. You guys like

209
00:12:57,520 --> 00:13:01,440
it was like what's going on until I seen this spreadsheet and says I drink

210
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:01,880
about four

211
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:05,280
so yeah

212
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:08,160
diarrhea all the fucking time. You're

213
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:13,680
drinking the worst coffee in the world from the bodegas. I've had diarrhea in

214
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:18,000
weeks. It's been probably the longest run of my life. I do not believe that

215
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,960
because I've heard to use the bathroom here. That's not diarrhea. That's just

216
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:22,360
far tiding between the poop

217
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:29,440
farts hiding between the you've never had that where like you go, you put out

218
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:37,880
you put out a turd and then there's like you have like six inches of part air

219
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:39,400
and then another turn.

220
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:47,040
The title is farts hiding between the poop pieces in the songs like I told

221
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:53,360
you that you were fifteen and not yeah. I have you guys been keeping up. Do you

222
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:58,320
know about this this e sports situation that's going on in the world. I don't

223
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:01,000
know pay attention to that. I pay attention to mostly skateboarding and

224
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:01,720
music. Yeah,

225
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:05,840
I mostly pay attention to literature.

226
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:12,000
There's this guy you guys will be interested in this guy. I think no as

227
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,440
maybe told me probably a little bit just due to he's a valor player used to play

228
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:19,680
for a team called Sentinels. Yes, he's told me. Yeah, so he's he's having like

229
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:24,720
like a full psychotic break and it's very sad, but it is it's creating some

230
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:29,020
pretty amazing stuff. He's been doing these streams where his face is like so,

231
00:14:29,020 --> 00:14:32,560
so three months ago he got arrested trying to buy a Lamborghini, 'cause they

232
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:35,220
wouldn't, they wouldn't sell him a Lamborghini, 'cause he didn't have the

233
00:14:35,220 --> 00:14:38,920
money for it, and he was like, I'm not leaving a T like one, he just like sat

234
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:43,460
on a Lamborghini until they arrested him, and then he was like radio silent for

235
00:14:43,460 --> 00:14:46,560
months, and then he started like tweeting about how he's gonna go live

236
00:14:46,580 --> 00:14:50,040
again, and so he's been tweeting. So I just have to read some of these. These

237
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:54,560
are he's posting like pictures of like a really fucked up weed set up and then

238
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:58,860
he's like Uber eating McDonald's and just posting his food every single day

239
00:14:58,860 --> 00:15:01,660
and in between he's saying stuff like

240
00:15:01,660 --> 00:15:03,260
like

241
00:15:03,260 --> 00:15:05,460
am I an AI?

242
00:15:05,460 --> 00:15:12,220
I'm going to Porsche tomorrow morning to pick up my car, plus a $100,000,000

243
00:15:12,220 --> 00:15:13,540
check to settle this war.

244
00:15:13,540 --> 00:15:15,980
He's tweeting the inward

245
00:15:15,980 --> 00:15:20,680
now. Oh my God, I just saw that he's calling himself hunter is the first

246
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:23,720
name is hunter. He's calling himself hunter or taga because he thinks that

247
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:25,220
he's marrying chin or

248
00:15:25,220 --> 00:15:31,220
he's taking her last. I'm going to go masturbate to Jenna or take a source

249
00:15:31,220 --> 00:15:35,480
material source material, which I don't know what that means means he's

250
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:40,460
animated her in source film maker. He's posting he's referring to himself as

251
00:15:40,460 --> 00:15:41,480
Eric Cartman

252
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:49,480
he's he's saying all nuclear weapons must be deactivated. I believe you know what

253
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:53,800
I'm on yeah, he's yeah, he's kind of spit. I mean he really a lot of this is

254
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:56,760
is like spitting honestly he's he's

255
00:15:56,760 --> 00:16:00,560
keeps talking about Joe Biden. He's saying can I have the presidential

256
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:01,200
position

257
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:05,920
and I think that'll work. I think if he tweets at Joe Biden and retards

258
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:09,880
everywhere in politics here in America, but we can fix that. Marry me, Jenna

259
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:11,840
Ortega back from jail again.

260
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:12,840
man.

261
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:20,440
Man, he what are his live streams, though, so the streams are he goes live

262
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:24,040
and he plays Valorant and he's so clearly cooked on Benzos. He has like a

263
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:28,600
most insanely puffy face looks like he's been stung by a bee. He like keeps

264
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:32,520
forgetting to mute and unmute his Mike and and the entire stream is him playing

265
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:36,280
Valor and just frying being really, really good, but then also he's getting

266
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:39,520
calls from every single person in his life constantly and they're telling him

267
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:40,920
stop streaming and he's just like

268
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:45,960
he just like mumbles out everything yeah. This is my one of my favorite ones.

269
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:50,160
So like I said, he's calling himself Eric Cartman, twenty four year old Eric

270
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:53,760
Cartman here. Great idea to stream soon. Sure, people will be reasonable and not

271
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:57,240
hurt because why would we anyway? Nothing else matters power through control, not

272
00:16:57,240 --> 00:17:00,720
dominance. This nation doesn't take war lightly, but nothing can stop the United

273
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:03,600
States. Is everyone brainwashed or am I retarded?

274
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:09,880
he's just got these heaters after heater after heaters and then my favorite one

275
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:10,920
is this where he says

276
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:17,700
where he said he he kind of gets you here. He he says I feel at peace. This

277
00:17:17,700 --> 00:17:20,400
was like after he had this stream where he like was

278
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:25,200
mumbling and his face looked all fucked up. He says I feel at peace currently

279
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:28,600
figuring out the situation slowly, but I also feel very alone because I can't

280
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:31,960
interact with people close to me. Thank you all for the support. Recently, it

281
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:35,600
means the world to me, so I'm going global now with my ideas

282
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:38,020
to gain some political

283
00:17:38,020 --> 00:17:45,680
damn. It's something I've been trying to do is go. I thought you were saying

284
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:48,160
like you're trying to have a mental break. No,

285
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:54,640
it's so crazy that one day you can just like snap like that. It's literally

286
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:59,160
just sounds like a matty gold to need valor ranked. I'm somewhat addicted to

287
00:17:59,180 --> 00:18:02,940
the thrill of such a game. I mean it's a true miracle.

288
00:18:02,940 --> 00:18:07,940
It's just so scary that you can just snap like that one day and then it's

289
00:18:07,940 --> 00:18:11,180
like you have no idea that you are

290
00:18:11,180 --> 00:18:15,300
like completely crazy. Everybody who does that and knows exactly what they're

291
00:18:15,300 --> 00:18:18,420
doing. Yeah, they're all playing, they're all playing a joke. And they have to be

292
00:18:18,420 --> 00:18:22,500
held accountable for every single thing that they did. Yeah, I do, I mean I just

293
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:23,060
think like,

294
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:28,100
I don't know man, I feel like there's no, if you do something like that, like play

295
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:31,640
video games for a living, there pretty much is no other ending but that to it.

296
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:32,140
Yeah.

297
00:18:32,140 --> 00:18:34,140
Right? Like how else do you get out of that life?

298
00:18:34,140 --> 00:18:37,140
That happened to, what's his name, Atika or whatever.

299
00:18:37,140 --> 00:18:38,140
I don't know who that is.

300
00:18:38,140 --> 00:18:43,140
He was the Super Smash Brothers streamer. They used to have a big mural of him by my old apartment,

301
00:18:43,140 --> 00:18:48,140
like my first place in New York. There was a huge ass mural of him. He like had a,

302
00:18:48,140 --> 00:18:51,140
he had like a psychotic break and then like killed himself.

303
00:18:51,140 --> 00:18:57,140
It's like the saddest, it's the saddest like streamer story besides like, what's his name?

304
00:18:57,140 --> 00:18:58,780
Wings of Redemption.

305
00:18:58,780 --> 00:19:00,780
Crying Chris, the streamer.

306
00:19:00,780 --> 00:19:03,740
Crying Chris had a really sad story.

307
00:19:03,740 --> 00:19:05,380
Crying Chris had one of the saddest

308
00:19:05,380 --> 00:19:06,600
streaming stories in the world

309
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:08,460
because it was just like, you know,

310
00:19:08,460 --> 00:19:10,040
he started out really good like

311
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:11,380
Modern Warfare 2 player in like

312
00:19:11,380 --> 00:19:13,760
2011 and then out of

313
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:15,660
nowhere all of his streams,

314
00:19:15,660 --> 00:19:17,580
Trickshotta, FaZe Clan, whatever,

315
00:19:17,580 --> 00:19:18,940
and then all of his streams are just

316
00:19:18,940 --> 00:19:21,540
him playing Nelly and Tim McGraw.

317
00:19:21,540 --> 00:19:22,540
Well, he started...

318
00:19:22,540 --> 00:19:23,540
It's all in my head.

319
00:19:23,540 --> 00:19:24,860
And he's playing like,

320
00:19:24,860 --> 00:19:26,740
he's playing Heavy Rain muted.

321
00:19:26,740 --> 00:19:28,740
Heavy Rain on mute just crying.

322
00:19:28,740 --> 00:19:33,740
He was playing Heavy Main on TF2 and he would only do taunts.

323
00:19:33,740 --> 00:19:35,740
So he would get killed.

324
00:19:35,740 --> 00:19:38,740
So he was like, "I've lived a million lifetimes."

325
00:19:38,740 --> 00:19:39,740
It was that heavy.

326
00:19:39,740 --> 00:19:40,740
That's sad as fuck.

327
00:19:40,740 --> 00:19:45,740
I guess the end point of being a streamer is either that you are caught doing something you shouldn't do

328
00:19:45,740 --> 00:19:52,740
while the camera is on because you forget or you completely get driven crazy by the pressure that that hasn't happened yet.

329
00:19:52,740 --> 00:19:54,740
I think that's actually what...

330
00:19:54,740 --> 00:19:57,740
what what is going to wondering when it will happen, what the thing is going to

331
00:19:57,740 --> 00:20:01,040
be. Is it just going to be that I stand up and I'm not wearing pants? I feel

332
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:05,200
like I or am I going to like throw my dog out the window. If I was a streamer,

333
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:08,500
I think I would probably try to get that out day one. Yeah, I think I would like

334
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:11,940
turn on the thing is you really here's my penis. You really want it to be

335
00:20:11,940 --> 00:20:16,780
accidental nudity because any yeah that I feel like the ones you always hear

336
00:20:16,780 --> 00:20:19,820
about are like yeah. He cut his girlfriend's head off. Well, he didn't

337
00:20:19,820 --> 00:20:22,660
realize that the camera was on cutting. Yes, saw your head off to be like

338
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:23,400
looks like I was

339
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:26,520
running to the key board and pressing a button.

340
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:31,120
Yeah, these streamers are sick. There's

341
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:37,840
people. It is the craziest profession in the world besides professional chef or

342
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:43,880
like that's or volcano skydiver, yeah skydiver, maybe back flip front flipper,

343
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:47,440
navy seal with PTSD or trying to work in

344
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:55,160
before hit man in an acting class or you see the new episode. No, I haven't seen

345
00:20:55,160 --> 00:21:00,480
the last two. I've never seen a single episode. I don't care. People shit on it

346
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:05,280
because it's Bill Hader with his head up his ass. Let's talk about it. All right,

347
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:10,520
let's go. All right, let's set so a panel on Barry. Barry, the season four

348
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:20,120
premiere was intense. Fuchs is in jail, Barry's in jail. Snowho Hank is trying to buy some

349
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:26,560
sand. What else happens? You've got to watch to find out. You just gave all the fucking

350
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:29,560
spoilers and then you say, but you have to watch to find out what he does with the sand.

351
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:32,840
That's not a spoiler. You're trying to buy sand? That's in the trailer. Oh, the sand thing

352
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:40,520
is a spoiler. Barry, I watched the first season. Barry, this show with other more

353
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:42,580
for quality program. I'd rather

354
00:21:42,580 --> 00:21:48,880
go with a bunch of other actually good shows. Yeah, I think it's underground.

355
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:53,640
Maybe make a show about different kinds of areas right now. My everyone, I

356
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:56,720
think for every point in my in your life, you have to have something that

357
00:21:56,720 --> 00:22:00,040
you have never watched, never seen or anything and that's because you're a

358
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:03,040
born hater. You just insist that you don't really bad. I don't believe it.

359
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:07,680
I think you have to have a philosophy. Yeah, I know it's the one your

360
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:10,640
philosophy. I mean you said you as in the

361
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:12,800
I

362
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:18,400
I think all three of us do that. I don't have something like you. Oh my what do I

363
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:23,160
hate? What do I hate? What do I hate? You hate so many one thing mother fucker. I

364
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:27,320
dare you if I hate so many you hate so many. I'll say like, oh yeah, it's pretty

365
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:32,680
fun. You're like, oh, okay. So your example is this thing. I have multiple

366
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:35,920
examples that I cannot think of right then. You don't have multiple examples,

367
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:40,880
buddy. Nice try. I'm not a hater. You're a hater in the sense of you say

368
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:41,720
something is gay.

369
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:45,080
Yeah, I would never say the G word. But you don't say, you don't say, you

370
00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:47,880
don't walk around being like, "I hate this," but if someone mentions something,

371
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:52,400
you'll call it gay. You know what else we'll do? Okay, perfect example. Okay,

372
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:55,620
now you have one. I can tell you have a really good one, 'cause you moved the

373
00:22:55,620 --> 00:22:58,240
microphone away. Perfect example. To breathe.

374
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:03,160
Don't you say skateboarding. Three weeks ago, no, two weeks ago,

375
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:08,540
We're at the bar. It doesn't matter what I'm going to lie. I'm putting the

376
00:23:08,540 --> 00:23:13,440
evidence out there. Okay. And there is receipts and people on your close

377
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:14,640
friends' Insta will know.

378
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:20,200
Two or three weeks ago, Neil's show or my old roommate, he has a show at

379
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:22,160
Revision Lounge. You can check it out.

380
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:28,200
He's on the bill. We're hanging out at the bar after the show. He says,

381
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:33,000
"I've been getting really into Pink Panther recently." Pink Panther is great.

382
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:34,860
That's the opposite. I like it.

383
00:23:34,860 --> 00:23:39,160
You did used to hate Pink Panther. When he listened to Pink Panther, you made fun of it.

384
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:43,560
Yeah, I didn't hate her. I said I didn't want her to come to America, drop that bomb.

385
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:44,360
No.

386
00:23:44,360 --> 00:23:45,060
Don't have a bomb.

387
00:23:45,060 --> 00:23:46,360
And I still think that.

388
00:23:46,360 --> 00:23:50,260
Because I was doing my DJ set last year and I put the song in there.

389
00:23:50,260 --> 00:23:53,460
I was sure this was earlier than I'd ever been to one of your DJ sets.

390
00:23:53,460 --> 00:23:54,760
I've avoided them at all costs.

391
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:57,460
You we did a show with Jacques that had a DJ set.

392
00:23:57,460 --> 00:23:58,760
And I went to the bathroom.

393
00:23:58,760 --> 00:24:01,460
You did. You stayed in the bathroom the whole time. Didn't want to hear me.

394
00:24:01,460 --> 00:24:02,760
I don't want to hear that bullshit.

395
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:06,560
I actually think I left right after, but it was that the beginning of the show.

396
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:08,560
Oh well, I then I was definitely not there.

397
00:24:08,560 --> 00:24:14,260
Well, there's one example you hated on it and then once it became a thing that

398
00:24:14,260 --> 00:24:15,380
you found you liked it.

399
00:24:15,380 --> 00:24:20,700
So this is not a good example. Check me is not a good. Yeah, I actually

400
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:23,520
thought of a bunch of examples that I can't say yeah, because they're all our

401
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:24,240
close friends.

402
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:30,720
Don't say that does everyone we know I do yeah, just like everyone we know I

403
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:35,920
hated and until just one day I was like actually or you think I still hate you

404
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:39,200
know people who you don't know who you hate like people you never met before

405
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:43,600
yep that you just are prejudice towards you're making me sound awful. I don't

406
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:47,900
have prejudice. This is now you're lying. I'll go with the pink panther thing,

407
00:24:47,900 --> 00:24:52,120
but now you're lying and I don't like that at all and you know what I hate is

408
00:24:52,120 --> 00:24:56,580
a lot of political figures that you really hate that you never met or given

409
00:24:56,580 --> 00:25:00,000
a chance. I don't I was thinking about as well that people are shitting on

410
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:03,620
this lady, this old fucking raggedy bones bitch, Dianne Feinstein.

411
00:25:03,620 --> 00:25:05,620
What's her deal?

412
00:25:05,620 --> 00:25:07,620
Just some ancient lady who has no idea where she is.

413
00:25:07,620 --> 00:25:08,620
Why are people like...

414
00:25:08,620 --> 00:25:11,620
She is one million years old and she needs to give up her senate seat.

415
00:25:11,620 --> 00:25:15,620
I literally do not give a fuck who is in any office on this planet.

416
00:25:15,620 --> 00:25:16,120
I hate her.

417
00:25:16,120 --> 00:25:16,620
Yeah, you do.

418
00:25:16,620 --> 00:25:17,120
You hate the government.

419
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:17,620
No, I do not.

420
00:25:17,620 --> 00:25:19,620
You hate the office of the government.

421
00:25:19,620 --> 00:25:20,120
I don't hate it.

422
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:20,620
I'm indifferent.

423
00:25:20,620 --> 00:25:21,120
Daryl?

424
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:21,620
Daryl?

425
00:25:21,620 --> 00:25:25,620
If Daryl doesn't stay in that office, then I will completely blame him.

426
00:25:25,620 --> 00:25:27,620
Well, yeah, because he moved up from the warehouse.

427
00:25:27,620 --> 00:25:32,780
I Darrell is honestly one of the few things in this world that I'm pretty

428
00:25:32,780 --> 00:25:38,660
sacred about. Yeah yeah. Darrell Philbin. Darrell Philbin from the office. That's

429
00:25:38,660 --> 00:25:44,540
the one thing that I think the first time that I met you back in 2011 I think.

430
00:25:44,540 --> 00:25:48,060
Yeah. Hey I'm Caleb you're wearing a shirt and there's a picture of Craig Robinson.

431
00:25:48,060 --> 00:25:51,620
Let's do an impression of each other the day that we met. Okay here's my

432
00:25:51,620 --> 00:25:52,460
my impression of you.

433
00:25:52,460 --> 00:26:03,580
And then I really how I used to you literally, I remember I met you. I was

434
00:26:03,580 --> 00:26:09,700
hanging. I met you. You were with Ben and you like got up on. I was like

435
00:26:09,700 --> 00:26:12,860
talking to Ben and like you were his little brother. You got up on the

436
00:26:12,860 --> 00:26:17,500
fountain. That was right next to and you like walked up and down the fountain.

437
00:26:18,540 --> 00:26:20,900
I remember one of the first times that--

438
00:26:20,900 --> 00:26:22,500
- Really tall guy, right?

439
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:23,820
- Yeah, you.

440
00:26:23,820 --> 00:26:25,380
One of the first times that I hung out with Patrick,

441
00:26:25,380 --> 00:26:27,700
what I remember is that he was,

442
00:26:27,700 --> 00:26:32,140
we were in that little alleyway that led to a city place,

443
00:26:32,140 --> 00:26:33,220
and you were on your skateboard.

444
00:26:33,220 --> 00:26:34,820
- That wasn't mine, that was Shev's.

445
00:26:34,820 --> 00:26:35,660
- Oh, excuse me.

446
00:26:35,660 --> 00:26:36,480
- That was Shev's.

447
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:37,320
- You were on somebody else's skateboard,

448
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:38,940
that's an important detail.

449
00:26:38,940 --> 00:26:42,380
And you were doing some tricks that you weren't landing,

450
00:26:42,380 --> 00:26:43,980
and you were saying like,

451
00:26:43,980 --> 00:26:45,420
man, I haven't skateboarded in a while,

452
00:26:45,420 --> 00:26:47,140
and I was thinking, why is he doing this?

453
00:26:47,140 --> 00:26:52,660
What's he doing? And that was a brick road also. That's tough to skate on.

454
00:26:52,660 --> 00:26:59,780
Yeah. I think I hadn't skated... I think that day, honestly, was the day that I

455
00:26:59,780 --> 00:27:04,240
was like, "I should start skating again." When did you? That's so crazy.

456
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:09,120
That is genuinely like... 'Cause I think I almost landed a kick flip and then

457
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:12,960
I was like, "Oh, fuck." I used to be good at that. Why did you stop?

458
00:27:13,740 --> 00:27:17,580
fat one. Fat, but that's a grad. You don't get, you don't wake up one day and be

459
00:27:17,580 --> 00:27:21,600
like, "Fuck me, I'm fat. Time to stop skating." No, I did that. I think I was

460
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:26,220
just like, I think I genuinely was like, "Oh, I don't know." Like, it's embarrassing

461
00:27:26,220 --> 00:27:29,780
for like somebody my age to still be skateboarding. And you said that when you

462
00:27:29,780 --> 00:27:34,000
were 19. Yeah, I said that when I was 19, I stopped skating for a really long

463
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:38,140
time. And then I met you guys when I was like 21. And now you're kind of going

464
00:27:38,140 --> 00:27:42,960
into the OG, kind of old, older man. Yeah, yeah, really old man. Old head's spurning

465
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:45,160
wisdom of the children. Old head who, who,

466
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:52,080
old head who what? Who's cracking all of his single bones every single day.

467
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:55,080
Cracking them? Cracking all of them single bones. Breaking them or cracking them like a

468
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:58,400
knuckle? And he hangs out with the 16 year olds and says, man, I used to be able

469
00:27:58,400 --> 00:28:02,080
to do that. Man, I used to be... It used to be different, man. Man, you used to not

470
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:05,720
be able to wear high ass pants, but now... You used to be able to say what you want

471
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:10,080
to. We used to wear high heels when we skated back in 2015. We used to get on our

472
00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:11,620
our skateboards, we used to get on our-

473
00:28:11,620 --> 00:28:13,340
Man, we used to wear polka dots.

474
00:28:13,340 --> 00:28:15,640
Man, shit's just different out.

475
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:17,060
I used to wear a blue shirt with a big star on it.

476
00:28:17,060 --> 00:28:18,080
Shit is just different.

477
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:19,520
We used to walk around-

478
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:21,040
I forgot about the star shirt.

479
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:23,980
I used to wear a dark blue shirt.

480
00:28:23,980 --> 00:28:26,000
A navy blue shirt with a gold star.

481
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,020
A big yellow gold star.

482
00:28:27,020 --> 00:28:29,340
Man, back in my day, when we skateboarded, we used to all wear

483
00:28:29,340 --> 00:28:30,360
that Sriracha shirt.

484
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:31,560
Yep.

485
00:28:31,560 --> 00:28:34,080
We used to walk around with the Sriracha shirt on.

486
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:36,600
All the skateboards used to be shaped like the Sriracha bottle.

487
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:40,100
What is up with men who wear the Sriracha shirt?

488
00:28:40,100 --> 00:28:45,620
It's the new try for sure off of your body. The red Sriracha shirt with the

489
00:28:45,620 --> 00:28:49,140
khaki cargoes. You do not need to be shopping at Marshalls. What's that type

490
00:28:49,140 --> 00:28:52,780
of fabric? That's what I was a type of person who goes to Marshall's. The

491
00:28:52,780 --> 00:28:56,900
polyester one or the like the all over print, the all over print one that's

492
00:28:56,900 --> 00:29:00,580
kind of like a soccer jersey. I'm talking about the red shirt that is like,

493
00:29:00,580 --> 00:29:04,440
yeah, it kind of has, it's like very stretchy. Yeah. It stretches over a fat

494
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:07,100
guy's belly. Well, that's a... And he wears a Sriracha thing because he's

495
00:29:07,100 --> 00:29:11,120
he's like, oh, it's food. I think that's a sixty forty cotton polyester bland

496
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:15,340
shirt. I think the next shirt that's going to catch on because the sriracha

497
00:29:15,340 --> 00:29:16,760
shirt that I mean,

498
00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:19,720
I think the next one is going to be a mayonnaise shirt.

499
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:26,160
Helman's yeah, that's literally these guys would be wearing a man. I was

500
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:29,580
available, yeah, instead of the sriracha, where the sriracha shirt, because they

501
00:29:29,580 --> 00:29:33,620
think it's exotic. That's the that's the fat guy equivalent of walking around

502
00:29:33,620 --> 00:29:36,760
with a shirt. That's a movie poster that has Japanese characters. Yeah,

503
00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:41,260
name of the movie there is like yeah. I like I like sauces, but I like exotic

504
00:29:41,260 --> 00:29:47,520
there's this kid on my bus in middle school. It's a ratchet shirt kid. He

505
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:52,180
definitely was a Sir Roger shirt kid. He was a pretty big boy and the guy, this

506
00:29:52,180 --> 00:29:56,600
kid in the back of the bus, Hunter was trying to get his attention and he's any

507
00:29:56,600 --> 00:30:01,620
I think he was wearing headphones and somebody like tapped him on the shoulder

508
00:30:01,620 --> 00:30:04,660
as soon as like Hunter was like hey fatty. There's a

509
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:07,260
in the back of the bus.

510
00:30:07,260 --> 00:30:13,620
That's mean. He turned around immediately and then the name I would to the name,

511
00:30:13,620 --> 00:30:15,480
the name mayonnaise stuck

512
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:21,540
because he dared to look at somebody who yelled at him, who was yelling at him

513
00:30:21,540 --> 00:30:26,500
for calling it horrible. I just thought of any, then he embraced it and we were

514
00:30:26,500 --> 00:30:29,460
just kind of like all right man, all right mayonnaise.

515
00:30:29,460 --> 00:30:32,360
It is a cool nickname.

516
00:30:33,280 --> 00:30:37,920
I don't like that. Yeah, that is pretty sick. That's a good one. I just came up

517
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:41,240
with a scenario that I want to lay out for you guys really quick. Go. So you see

518
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:44,960
a guy, he's wearing a Sriracha shirt. Yeah, he's like maybe, maybe, maybe he's

519
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:45,680
on your maybe

520
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:50,720
can't help myself. I pull it down right there in the middle of a bus stop. I'm

521
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:54,580
fucking sucking his cock. I pull down those khaki cargoes. I pull down his Bob

522
00:30:54,580 --> 00:30:58,280

523
00:30:58,280 --> 00:31:00,600
on his fucking balls. I'm getting the whole thing down there. Maybe he's on,

524
00:31:00,620 --> 00:31:03,620
maybe he's on your on your daily commute like he's on your bus or something,

525
00:31:03,620 --> 00:31:07,200
and then I do it every day. I don't know him in a saran sure bus driver,

526
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:07,480
which

527
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:11,620
I don't care. I'll give him road head. Why drive the bus? All right, get up

00:31:11,620 --> 00:31:15,660
here and you think okay, this is it's a saran shirt guy great like oh great.

529
00:31:15,660 --> 00:31:19,040
He's wearing the saran shirt and then the next day you get on the bus. He's

530
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:24,080
wearing another shirt. Kikoman so sauce next day, Heinz Ketchup next day

531
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:26,140
Helman's man. You realize he's a full sauce. He's a

532
00:31:27,660 --> 00:31:32,860
thought he was a Sirachus. No, just so is a full sauce ward. Wow! His name is

533
00:31:32,860 --> 00:31:39,020

00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:53,120

00:31:57,100 --> 00:32:01,640
Friday Friday, well, he's green try for a shirt gold. Well, yeah, I know, but

539
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:02,060
nothing on

540
00:32:02,060 --> 00:32:05,820
Thursday. No sure day is a button down. That's a

541
00:32:05,820 --> 00:32:11,900
print of oh with a vest. Yeah, there's days. Thursday is definitely a bright

542
00:32:11,900 --> 00:32:16,180
button down. Yeah, like a really bright one, like a pink, a pink button down

543
00:32:16,180 --> 00:32:19,940
with a pattern on it. Yeah, Saturday, it's the weekend. It's a try for shirt,

544
00:32:19,940 --> 00:32:23,940
but he cut the sleeves off. Well, that's tough. Yeah, that is tough.

545
00:32:24,940 --> 00:32:29,080
the triforce shirt and the khaki cargo Sunday, maybe a maybe a Sunday's going

546
00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:33,260
to church. So it's a full suit, so it's the same as the same as Thursday, but I

547
00:32:33,260 --> 00:32:36,500
want other shirts. I want a nirvana shirt in there. Yeah, a really, really

548
00:32:36,500 --> 00:32:40,240
bad nirvana shirt would be good in there. Star Wars, Empire Strikes Back,

549
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:46,940
faces of Vader, the faces of expressions of Vader shirt is going to be here.

550
00:32:46,940 --> 00:32:50,440
Yeah, see, but that's a little too like even those guys, but that's how he's

551
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:54,360
wearing it. He's wearing it. Ironically, yeah, okay, as he's like I would never

552
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:56,560
for this. I'll wear a fucking

553
00:32:56,560 --> 00:33:01,480
Helman's mustard shirt, but I'm not wearing

554
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:03,080
fucking

555
00:33:03,080 --> 00:33:10,080
Helman's Mayo T shirt. It would dare I say it would be a shirt that would go

556
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:12,440
hard. It would go hard. Yeah, wow,

557
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:15,240
I would wear that. I think shirts

558
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:20,600
the guy. It was like a genuine like do you think one day they asked it like who

559
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:24,640
was the first guy was like, let's put fucking Sirach on a shirt. People will

560
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:28,240
wear that. Yeah, I mean, it was you know, what happened in fourteen? Well,

561
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:31,280
actually, nobody what happened was any of them and then they got to marshals

562
00:33:31,280 --> 00:33:35,280
and they went crazy. A guy was wearing a plain t shirt. Yeah, he was eating

563
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:39,720
food. He got Sirach on his shirt. His friend said, Hey man, you got Sirach on

564
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:42,680
your shirt. Why pull up above his head? Sirach shirt.

565
00:33:42,680 --> 00:33:48,320
You know what it actually was. I think I do. I think they make no money off

566
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:50,040
shirts than they do the fucking tops.

567
00:33:50,040 --> 00:33:54,320
So in 2014, like yeah, like everybody, like they had like the fucking Sriracha like key

568
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:56,400
chain and stuff that you could like keep that shit.

569
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:58,000
Why did they, who did that?

570
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,000
I don't know.

571
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:00,000
Why did Sriracha become a...

572
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,000
There has to be some like...

573
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:02,000
There has to be some like...

574
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,760
The company that makes Sriracha.

575
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:06,760
One ingenious marketing guy who did all this stuff.

576
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:09,400
It was Paul Rodriguez of the Permanent Skateboards.

577
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:11,240
The Power Rangers guy.

578
00:34:11,240 --> 00:34:14,280
Paul Rodriguez did this collab with Sriracha.

579
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:15,880
No that is not the first thing he did.

580
00:34:15,880 --> 00:34:20,560
No, it was huge. It was like a really big collab. They were making like Sriracha skateboards

581
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:23,760
and all the Sriracha shirts were gone through Primitive.

582
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:27,600
They would not go Sriracha skateboard first.

583
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:32,620
They did Kikkoman. They did the Kikkoman soy sauce too. They did a Kikkoman soy sauce cruiser

584
00:34:32,620 --> 00:34:34,680
board that's shaped like the soy sauce bottle.

585
00:34:34,680 --> 00:34:38,760
Oh, and our motherfuckers walking around with Kikkoman soy sauce shirts? Not that often.

586
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:39,760
They used to.

587
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:40,760
No, no, no, no.

588
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:43,320
The primitive Kikkoman soy sauce collab was also very big.

589
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:44,800
Who thinks soy sauce is primitive?

590
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:46,800
No, the skateboard company.

591
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:48,800
What the hell is wrong with you?

592
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:50,800
I don't know why I know all that, but I know it.

593
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:52,800
I know why you know all that.

594
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:54,800
Because you like skating.

595
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:57,800
Also their Naruto and Dragon Ball Z collabs are the only thing that's keeping them afloat.

596
00:34:57,800 --> 00:34:59,800
Which is insane.

597
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:01,800
Oh wait, really?

598
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:03,800
Yeah.

599
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:05,800
I'm sorry. I didn't realize that.

600
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:07,800
That's why their team is so big.

601
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:09,800
I really hope nothing happens to those two collabs then.

602
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:11,800
They'll probably go under.

603
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:15,160
No, Tiago Lemons would not get a check.

604
00:35:15,160 --> 00:35:16,560
Tiago Lemons?

605
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:18,120
Tiago Lemons would not get a check.

606
00:35:18,120 --> 00:35:19,840
What a fucking normal name to have.

607
00:35:19,840 --> 00:35:20,840
He's Brazilian.

608
00:35:20,840 --> 00:35:21,840
Lemons?

609
00:35:21,840 --> 00:35:22,840
He's Brazilian, that's why.

610
00:35:22,840 --> 00:35:23,840
You know, have you ever heard of Brazilian...

611
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:25,840
Why is he not named Tiago Lime?

612
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:28,840
Have you seen the Brazilian lemonade thing?

613
00:35:28,840 --> 00:35:30,840
Yeah, it looks like shit.

614
00:35:30,840 --> 00:35:34,840
Dude, it's limes. They're calling it lemonade. It's all limes and it's milk.

615
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:37,840
In Spanish they call it the same thing. It's just a lemon.

616
00:35:37,840 --> 00:35:38,840
Limon.

617
00:35:38,840 --> 00:35:39,840
It's the same.

618
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:40,840
It's the same?

619
00:35:40,840 --> 00:35:44,720
Yeah. Is it the same fruit? It's not the same fruit, but they just, it's just a,

620
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:47,000
it's a, they're both a, a, a Limon.

621
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:53,760
So they at least say Limon Amarillo? Limon Trotsky. Um, not really.

622
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:57,040
They just don't have, they don't even know how to tell the difference.

623
00:35:57,040 --> 00:35:59,600
They just don't give a fuck. It's not that big of a deal.

624
00:35:59,600 --> 00:36:03,320
It's like the difference between an, a red apple or a green apple.

625
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:04,160
We don't know how to,

626
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:08,120
I don't know how to differentiate between those two.

627
00:36:08,120 --> 00:36:12,960
you the day that I found out I was allergic to raw apples is devastating.

628
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:16,800
I used to love to just you know, a big honey crisp and just take a big old

629
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:21,040
bite out of it. A honey what if you wait, where you were you not allergic to

630
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:24,360
apples and then you became allergic to apples, you know, like those allergies

631
00:36:24,360 --> 00:36:27,640
that you get when you like like every seven years. So you didn't used to be

632
00:36:27,640 --> 00:36:31,920
allergic and then you became allergic. I think so yeah, well, I wasn't alert. I

633
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:36,200
found out because I ate a big bag of cherries and then you thought these are

634
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:37,440
kind of like a full

635
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:43,560
stomach hurt and then my stomach was swollen. It's six hundred cherries

636
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:44,880
maraschino cherries

637
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:49,520
maraschino cherry and I threw a do maraschino other fruits. I agree a

638
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:51,760
maraschino banana sounds so

639
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:53,360
fucking good

640
00:36:53,360 --> 00:36:56,080
where you can eat the peel. Oh,

641
00:36:56,080 --> 00:37:02,160
Maraschino melon maraschino, you know, it actually would be good. Yeah, I

642
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:05,440
think it's just got sugar on it. Right there. She no, I don't even know

643
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:11,640
Maraschino Apple. Who's Maraschino? Maraschino is a former WNBA player.

644
00:37:11,640 --> 00:37:16,640
I feel like we talked about this before, so tell me if we did, but I knew this before and I completely forgot about it,

645
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:19,640
but then I was talking about it with my family when I was back in Boston.

646
00:37:19,640 --> 00:37:20,640
We already talked about this.

647
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:22,640
That Scally Bread is only in Boston.

648
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:25,640
Yeah, I was talking about Scally Bread last night.

649
00:37:25,640 --> 00:37:29,640
Yeah, and it's called that because there was a family called the Scally family.

650
00:37:29,640 --> 00:37:31,640
The Scally family in the North End, yeah.

651
00:37:31,640 --> 00:37:35,160
I looked it up because I was looking when I first moved here. I was trying to buy

652
00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:39,720
scally bread somewhere thinking about something. What I am trying to make

653
00:37:39,720 --> 00:37:41,080
something work in my head. Okay,

654
00:37:41,080 --> 00:37:43,000
all right, go ahead.

655
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:49,800
I'm still going to go. Now I was trying to do maybe a Terry Shivo cherry, but

656
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:54,040
then I got now I would have to be a vegetable. Well, that's what I was

657
00:37:54,040 --> 00:37:57,400
thinking about how funny it would be to be talking about somebody who had a

658
00:37:57,400 --> 00:38:00,600
brain injury in there in a coma and like you're it's like your dad telling

659
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:04,000
somebody and he's like, "Yeah, Chris, he fell off a ladder. He's stuck in the hospital. He's

660
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,000
a complete fruit now."

661
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:11,760
He's just getting confused. "Yeah, it's real sad. My cousin went to the hospital. He's

662
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:16,800
a fruitcake." Anyway, sorry. You guys talk about bread.

663
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:21,160
I do think a Terry Shivo cherry is good.

664
00:38:21,160 --> 00:38:23,340
What about a maraschino human?

665
00:38:23,340 --> 00:38:26,840
That would just be a wet guy. I mean, I turn into a maraschino human when I come out of

666
00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:30,960
the fuck when I'm done playing basketball. I've told you guys about when I play basketball

667
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:36,080
that I get so sweaty that I thought I was really good at pick up basketball because

668
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:38,440
nobody would want to get close to me because I'd get so sweaty.

669
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:41,360
You told us about that.

670
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:45,320
I think that I have some kind of medical, I think it might be a superpower.

671
00:38:45,320 --> 00:38:47,760
Did you get your cholesterol checked?

672
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:49,720
I don't even care.

673
00:38:49,720 --> 00:38:50,720
Maybe that's it.

674
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:51,720
My cholesterol?

675
00:38:51,720 --> 00:38:53,200
Maybe you drink so much coffee.

676
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:54,840
There's no anything in this.

677
00:38:54,840 --> 00:38:55,840
Sodium.

678
00:38:55,840 --> 00:38:59,600
sodium in coffee, are you crazy? You put sodium in there, you put sodium chloride

679
00:38:59,600 --> 00:39:02,800
in there. You put salt in your coffee thinking it's sugar and you're like,

680
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:07,760
"Damn, this makes me taste good." Makes me taste good? Probably would make me

681
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:10,320
taste good. Yeah, it makes you taste good because you're brining your insides.

682
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:16,320
No, you would taste the best. You're like an olive wagyu cow. I would not taste

683
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:21,680
the best. You are. The stuff that I eat, Doritos, Mountain Dew. You're a turducken.

684
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:25,520
Actually, I think I would taste the best. You would probably taste normal. No. I

685
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:28,660
that I have taste. He would taste like chicken feet. I have a

686
00:39:28,660 --> 00:39:33,020
Mediterranean diet. Yeah, yeah, I was told to go on the Mediterranean diet by

687
00:39:33,020 --> 00:39:35,480
a doctor. What's the Mediterranean fucking doctor?

688
00:39:35,480 --> 00:39:41,600
He recommended, you know what, you know, writes a prescription for his

689
00:39:41,600 --> 00:39:45,080
family's restaurant. It's making it's making a lot of sense. Yeah, the doctor's

690
00:39:45,080 --> 00:39:48,920
office was on top of a doctor. Coppelopolis. Yeah, yeah, you just go

691
00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:52,680
right down the stairs. Yeah, I read and then he's like, yeah, and you're going

692
00:39:52,680 --> 00:39:57,120
I'm going to have to worship some new gods. Yes, a whole pantheon and I'll say

693
00:39:57,120 --> 00:39:59,400
is it cool if I change their fucking names?

694
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:03,320
I'm Roman, I'm Italian, yeah,

695
00:40:03,320 --> 00:40:08,600
they nobody worships the Greek gods. I would piss me off. I do that would piss

696
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:11,240
me off. If some do you guys ever think that that's going to happen,

697
00:40:11,240 --> 00:40:17,320
there are there are people who call themselves Apolloists or something, but I

698
00:40:17,320 --> 00:40:21,120
don't think they actually worship Apollo. No, they just Richard Spencer says that

699
00:40:21,160 --> 00:40:24,920
worships Apollo or something. Really? Isn't that funny? I didn't know that.

700
00:40:24,920 --> 00:40:25,260
Yeah.

701
00:40:25,260 --> 00:40:30,720
It was the first. I guess, yeah. He would ever saw the other Nazi guys

702
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:34,120
getting into Norse mythology and he's like, "I have to be a little different

703
00:40:34,120 --> 00:40:39,760
here." I gotta be weird. Yeah. I'm sick of these alt Nazis. Just be a normal

704
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:43,200
one. Why do you have to be like, "No, I'm gonna be..." I like great stuff.

705
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:43,520
Yeah.

706
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:46,800
I'm gonna wear a suit. Just wear the outfit. It's already cool enough. They

707
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:51,960
They all wear suits. It's so crazy. They all wear suits and the suits look very

708
00:40:51,960 --> 00:40:52,960
ill-fitting.

709
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:54,960
Yeah, because they look ill in them.

710
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:55,960
Damn, you look...

711
00:40:55,960 --> 00:40:56,960
I'm not saying that.

712
00:40:56,960 --> 00:40:58,960
And fit. Proper fit.

713
00:40:58,960 --> 00:40:59,960
They're not looking...

714
00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:04,440
Hey, you know what, Richard Spencer? You are not looking proper fit. You look like a proper

715
00:41:04,440 --> 00:41:05,440
bitch.

716
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:06,440
Oops.

717
00:41:06,440 --> 00:41:12,440
Joker gun. Oh, the bang gun.

718
00:41:12,440 --> 00:41:15,440
It's a complete accident.

719
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:19,840
that actually is a sick. If you play those at the same time again, it sounds

720
00:41:19,840 --> 00:41:22,660
really cool. Do you guys think that one day they'll change the gods of

721
00:41:22,660 --> 00:41:25,740
Christianity like they did with Rome? Oh, absolutely. They're gonna be calling

722
00:41:25,740 --> 00:41:26,560
Jesus Barack.

723
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:28,360
That's right.

724
00:41:28,360 --> 00:41:32,660
They'll call Jesus Barack. They'll call God

725
00:41:32,660 --> 00:41:35,480
fucking Billy Eilish.

726
00:41:35,480 --> 00:41:40,280
Fucking. They may be, now I'm thinking about it, it would, back then when

727
00:41:40,280 --> 00:41:45,000
everyone had a thousand gods and they all each had names and stuff, and then

728
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:48,560
and they were like we're going to have one God and we're not even give him a

729
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:50,680
name and if we do, you're not allowed to say it.

730
00:41:50,680 --> 00:41:56,080
Do you think this religion stuff is all hocus pocus? Yeah, not me. I actually

731
00:41:56,080 --> 00:41:57,840
starting to believe. Yeah,

732
00:41:57,840 --> 00:42:03,560
I believe more and I'm more of a believer in aliens. I'm more of a

733
00:42:03,560 --> 00:42:08,480
believer in thoughts and ideas. Yeah, the marketplace of ideas. I'm starting to

734
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:11,600
believe a whole new type of religion that I just thought of,

735
00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:17,780
just who gives a fuck gives a fuck ism who gives a fuck ism Eric and Jack show

736
00:42:17,780 --> 00:42:22,160
I DGAF ology is what you're thinking of. No, I'm thinking of my whole

737
00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:26,480
ology is a science. Well, he believes in the science who cares about any of this

738
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:31,280
stuff. We're all going to die. Oh, this is actually damn somebody else already

739
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:38,160
made up this. It's nihilism absurdist absurdist nihilism that I have and I

740
00:42:38,160 --> 00:42:43,060
I guess I have. I guess I have been kind of more into memes lately. Yeah, I'm

741
00:42:43,060 --> 00:42:48,440
more of a believer in stuff that is not short. I send him all these amazing,

742
00:42:48,440 --> 00:42:51,660
incredible. He sent me a good this morning. Did you write that one

743
00:42:51,660 --> 00:42:56,400
customly? Well, I found that one really. I found that one and I copied and

744
00:42:56,400 --> 00:42:59,860
pasted it because I didn't feel like crediting the author. Let me pull it up.

745
00:42:59,860 --> 00:43:06,620
I saw somebody retweet it and I was like, damn, moving the mic away, like

746
00:43:06,640 --> 00:43:10,880
Charlemagne because I've been watching a lot of that a lot of you said a lot of

747
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:14,400
breakfast club ass tits bro her shit posts.

748
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:20,080
These are all memes. I've been sending Cameron all these. I don't understand

749
00:43:20,080 --> 00:43:24,560
that means and philosophical questions and ideas. I posited Cameron one of the

750
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:31,720
craziest philosophical ideas, which was would you rather do Sidney Sweeney? No,

751
00:43:31,720 --> 00:43:35,680
no, no, that was a detective. Okay, Cameron say yours first and then I'll

752
00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:39,640
they might wait yeah. This is actually a hard question okay or no it's not for me,

753
00:43:39,640 --> 00:43:40,120
but for some

754
00:43:40,120 --> 00:43:51,000
would you rather have sex with yeah, Sydney, Sweeney or a shaggy sheep?

755
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:53,400
Yeah, so

756
00:43:53,400 --> 00:43:59,880
there's way no, no, no, there was a lot of added thing okay, so you need to

757
00:43:59,880 --> 00:44:02,640
finish the whole thing yeah. I know I just wanted to make you look like a fool.

758
00:44:02,720 --> 00:44:09,360
I am a fool, the shaggy sheep, which it is, it has to be shaggy, has a sheep STD

759
00:44:09,360 --> 00:44:14,600
that none of humanity has ever contracted even once, but if it, but it

760
00:44:14,600 --> 00:44:18,640
will, it will be contracted by you. It's a female sheep, not a male sheep, by

761
00:44:18,640 --> 00:44:23,920
the way, okay, and you will get it and it will cause an outbreak of a new

762
00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:28,920
disease. That is a sheep STD to everyone in the world, but I do I have to have

763
00:44:28,960 --> 00:44:32,420
is actually a bunch of people to cause the outbreak or what? No, it's it

764
00:44:32,420 --> 00:44:32,880
becomes I

765
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:38,440
yeah, it's like it's like emanating from you. Okay, yeah, so that's it's a it's

766
00:44:38,440 --> 00:44:42,960
a bat soup situation. Yeah, exactly, and how many it's zoonotic. How many people

767
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:47,240
die from this? Oh quarter million. I was about to say twenty million. We can go

768
00:44:47,240 --> 00:44:51,640
with that's the either one. I mean any if you even said if you said a millionth

769
00:44:51,640 --> 00:44:55,000
of a million, that's still if it has a million in there, I'm, but you won't die.

770
00:44:55,680 --> 00:44:59,820
you won't die, but you'll be sick, but everyone knows it was you and you're on

771
00:44:59,820 --> 00:45:04,200
the new me for seven all right and your and the disease makes your penis turn

772
00:45:04,200 --> 00:45:08,480
completely blue and hairs grow out of it and it can't be covered by your pants

773
00:45:08,480 --> 00:45:12,380
and they put you on the news and then now the other side, the other side of

774
00:45:12,380 --> 00:45:16,540
it, Sidney Sweeney. Yes, it's for she's four years old and it's Christmas

775
00:45:25,040 --> 00:45:29,580
man. Yeah, see that's hard. See that's the kind of questions that me and

776
00:45:29,580 --> 00:45:33,900
Cameron posit to each other all the time. That we develop. We have, we have

777
00:45:33,900 --> 00:45:37,000
literally hard philosophical conversations like this. This is one of

778
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:40,060
those philosophical questions where I feel like you're, you need to ask a

779
00:45:40,060 --> 00:45:43,520
mathematician or something. It's, it started, it started when I asked Patrick

780
00:45:43,520 --> 00:45:46,560
just would you rather fuck Sidney Sweeney or a shaggy sheep, and then I

781
00:45:46,560 --> 00:45:49,600
just kept adding details. You wanted to balance the scale a little bit. Yeah,

782
00:45:49,600 --> 00:45:53,160
it turned into something horrible. Yeah. So then I asked him,

783
00:45:53,960 --> 00:46:00,080
I asked him a question that I think is probably the same amount of hardness.

784
00:46:00,080 --> 00:46:01,080
Okay.

785
00:46:01,080 --> 00:46:10,120
Would you rather have $30 taken out of your bank account every single hour for the next

786
00:46:10,120 --> 00:46:16,640
18 days or become a registered sex offender for the rest of your life?

787
00:46:16,640 --> 00:46:17,640
No, you did not say registered.

788
00:46:17,640 --> 00:46:18,640
You said be a pedophile is what you said.

789
00:46:18,640 --> 00:46:19,640
You said be a pedophile.

790
00:46:19,640 --> 00:46:20,640
It's the same thing.

791
00:46:20,640 --> 00:46:21,640
No, it's not.

792
00:46:21,640 --> 00:46:22,640
It's not the same thing at all.

793
00:46:22,640 --> 00:46:27,040
it's not the thing at all to register to be a pedophile in society. You have to

794
00:46:27,040 --> 00:46:30,280
register, but you're no, but pedophile means it is the there are a bunch of

795
00:46:30,280 --> 00:46:33,280
underground pedophiles running around who are unregistered. You don't have to

796
00:46:33,280 --> 00:46:36,260
it's not like say, oh, fuck, I just realized I'm a pedophile. I thought they

797
00:46:36,260 --> 00:46:40,360
were all in a database. No, no, they're in the database. If they show off the

798
00:46:40,360 --> 00:46:44,480
grid pedophiles, Jesus, by a big ranch. So you are so, so yeah, that's the

799
00:46:44,480 --> 00:46:49,440
question is, would you rather lose thirty dollars right time every hour,

800
00:46:49,460 --> 00:46:53,820
one times twenty four. It's not that much money times eighteen for eighteen days

801
00:46:53,820 --> 00:46:56,620
eighteen days. Yeah, that's twelve thousand nine hundred and sixty dollars.

802
00:46:56,620 --> 00:46:59,540
Yeah. So would you rather pay? I mean it's a lot of twelve thousand nine

803
00:46:59,540 --> 00:47:03,540
hundred and sixty dollars or I don't have the money, but I think in eighteen

804
00:47:03,540 --> 00:47:08,580
days, wait, I could easily come not easily, but I could, but I but also

805
00:47:08,580 --> 00:47:12,260
explain your since you said bank account, you can get overdrafted right.

806
00:47:12,260 --> 00:47:16,060
That's okay. Okay, wait, oh yeah, of course, so maybe so I would do that. If

807
00:47:16,100 --> 00:47:19,500
just the fucking yeah zero dollars. The money isn't going anywhere. So

808
00:47:19,500 --> 00:47:23,780
Saturday, I wait who gets the money yeah. Is it a I don't know I think I

809
00:47:23,780 --> 00:47:26,500
think it's just the government, but here's another question that I asked.

810
00:47:26,500 --> 00:47:30,180
Do I get tax thirteen K? This is a more important. The government is doing

811
00:47:30,180 --> 00:47:30,620
this.

812
00:47:30,620 --> 00:47:34,340
This is a more important question here. You want me to read it?

813
00:47:34,340 --> 00:47:39,940
Saturday, five twenty four PM. I texted Cameron with a question that I knew

814
00:47:39,940 --> 00:47:45,100
would blow his mind. Okay, as it took him two hours to reply because he was so

815
00:47:45,660 --> 00:47:50,820
was pondering it. Would you nut in your cousin if a scientist told you it'd create the cure

816
00:47:50,820 --> 00:47:55,180
for cancer, but you found out later it was a mad scientist who was lying to you?

817
00:47:55,180 --> 00:47:56,180
And what did I answer?

818
00:47:56,180 --> 00:47:59,820
You said, "I would do my own research first to confirm whether the scientist was telling

819
00:47:59,820 --> 00:48:01,100
the truth or not."

820
00:48:01,100 --> 00:48:03,460
And then would you real quickly just read what your next text was?

821
00:48:03,460 --> 00:48:10,100
"Sunday at 11.21 a.m. I probably woke up an hour before that." Texted Cameron, picture

822
00:48:10,100 --> 00:48:13,260
your old Greg with the quote it's attached to your rod mother licker.

823
00:48:13,260 --> 00:48:21,300
Okay, wait, this is actually good. Would you rather drink Bailey's from a shoe

824
00:48:21,300 --> 00:48:24,220
or fuck your cousin?

825
00:48:24,220 --> 00:48:35,900
See, because that question like how dirty is the is it like a shoe? It's all

826
00:48:35,900 --> 00:48:39,540
great shoe. It's all the bottom of the sea or the lake. Yeah,

827
00:48:39,540 --> 00:48:45,340
Am I going to get a Greg a real cryptid? No, oh

828
00:48:45,340 --> 00:48:51,060
he's not like a legend. He is a legend, but it is a proper. He's a proper

829
00:48:51,060 --> 00:48:52,580
legend for the video, but

830
00:48:52,580 --> 00:49:00,460
is he? Can you go and see like a like a place? What is all Greg up to? He

831
00:49:00,460 --> 00:49:04,500
hasn't made a video in a minute. He I think he went to have an old Greg

832
00:49:04,500 --> 00:49:07,820
reunion. I think he went like Kev Jumbo. He like went. He became a monk or

833
00:49:07,860 --> 00:49:12,300
something. Did Kev Jumbo become a monk? Yeah, he became very religious and went

834
00:49:12,300 --> 00:49:17,940
and became. Kev Jumbo was one of those YouTubers where I like as a kid, I saw

835
00:49:17,940 --> 00:49:20,900
that he was like number one most subscribed or something and I was like, I

836
00:49:20,900 --> 00:49:23,300
wonder what this is all about and I clicked on it. I was like, I don't

837
00:49:23,300 --> 00:49:25,860
understand this at all. Why do people care about this? That's what all of them

838
00:49:25,860 --> 00:49:28,740
are, right? But at least if like, I don't know, maybe I did. I don't actually

839
00:49:28,740 --> 00:49:30,780
even know what Kev Jumbo really did. A lot of these, a lot of people who do

840
00:49:30,780 --> 00:49:34,460
like streaming and YouTube stuff are so uninteresting, but because they are there

841
00:49:34,500 --> 00:49:39,000
all the time people are held hostage by the like the only thing that they see

842
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:41,940
every single day. So then they're like, oh, I guess I kind of like that's

843
00:49:41,940 --> 00:49:45,380
worrying about this person's life big now, Shane Dawson, but that's because he

844
00:49:45,380 --> 00:49:48,980
did funny voice, Shane Dawson. Yeah, you can look at a guy like Jumbo and you're

845
00:49:48,980 --> 00:49:52,820
like, I understand, yeah, yeah, I understand why why people are watching

846
00:49:52,820 --> 00:49:56,200
this, because he's doing he's why people are watching this, because he's doing

847
00:49:56,200 --> 00:50:00,580
videos that are he's doing skits, yeah, but kept jumbo just talked about his

848
00:50:00,600 --> 00:50:05,300
life and was just like yeah, but he did the amazing race, though that's what it

849
00:50:05,300 --> 00:50:09,240
was with his daddy. Yeah, it was pretty funny. Yeah, his dad was real name

850
00:50:09,240 --> 00:50:14,920
jumper. His last name was Jumba. No, yeah, he's a Cajun fella. Yeah, I was a

851
00:50:14,920 --> 00:50:20,320
Cajun man, Kev, John, yeah, Kev, John. I remember he's a monk now, Shane Dawson.

852
00:50:20,320 --> 00:50:24,320
So somebody told me that at least he could be just a guy, but I don't think

853
00:50:24,320 --> 00:50:28,440
he I think he quit every online thing and started doing monk like stuff. At the

854
00:50:28,480 --> 00:50:35,200
least. I remember when I was 11 years old seeing a Shane Dawson video where he's supposed to be

855
00:50:35,200 --> 00:50:44,400
Corbin Blue and he looks like he jumped in a vat of pudding and he is wearing an afro wig.

856
00:50:44,400 --> 00:50:45,200
Kevjamba?

857
00:50:45,200 --> 00:50:50,160
No, Shane Dawson. He's in full, he's in a black face.

858
00:50:50,160 --> 00:50:52,720
You would say pudding face, I guess is what you're saying.

859
00:50:52,720 --> 00:50:59,040
the shade of brown that he used for this black face looked like chocolate pudding.

860
00:50:59,040 --> 00:51:03,000
And I wish Juvio is here to pull up a picture because it is extremely dark.

861
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:07,480
Chocolate pudding is not what I would... I mean, I feel like that's a normal skin tone to have.

862
00:51:07,480 --> 00:51:09,240
That's not that like crazy.

863
00:51:09,240 --> 00:51:10,000
No, but like the...

864
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:12,200
A normal skin tone to have as a white person?

865
00:51:12,200 --> 00:51:13,720
Not as a white person, probably.

866
00:51:13,720 --> 00:51:14,320
The sheen that the light...

867
00:51:14,320 --> 00:51:16,800
I don't know. I mean, I'm scared. What do I say?

868
00:51:16,800 --> 00:51:19,000
The sheen that the light would hit in the video.

869
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:19,840
I mean, I don't know.

870
00:51:19,920 --> 00:51:26,920
the studio lights that he had in the video, they're shining on his face so crazy

871
00:51:26,920 --> 00:51:32,920
that it looks like if it was in black and white it would probably be the scariest thing you'd ever see in a David Lynch movie.

872
00:51:32,920 --> 00:51:33,920
I'd bite his head off.

873
00:51:33,920 --> 00:51:34,920
Yeah.

874
00:51:34,920 --> 00:51:35,920
Hey David Lynch.

875
00:51:35,920 --> 00:51:36,920
He was really made out of pudding.

876
00:51:36,920 --> 00:51:37,920
Hey David Lynch.

877
00:51:37,920 --> 00:51:38,920
Be normal bitch!

878
00:51:38,920 --> 00:51:39,920
Stop making weird flicks.

879
00:51:39,920 --> 00:51:40,920
Yep.

880
00:51:40,920 --> 00:51:43,920
I don't want to go to the, here's me at the movie theater, this is what I want to do.

881
00:51:43,920 --> 00:51:44,920
Eat my popcorn.

882
00:51:44,920 --> 00:51:45,920
Drink my soda.

883
00:51:45,920 --> 00:51:46,920
I'll watch a couple minutes.

884
00:51:46,920 --> 00:51:47,920
Look at my Insta.

885
00:51:47,920 --> 00:51:50,620
so yeah look at my phone and then every once in a while I look up and I'd like

886
00:51:50,620 --> 00:51:55,680
to see a fight scene. Yeah, I do not want to look at somebody who's shorter than

887
00:51:55,680 --> 00:51:56,320
average

888
00:51:56,320 --> 00:52:04,200
doing this being odd. I do not want to see any more zigzags. I do not want to

889
00:52:04,200 --> 00:52:09,680
more zigzags people with dirt on them. I do not want to see a fast woman. I don't

890
00:52:09,680 --> 00:52:15,000
want to see somebody talking like a weird bitch and I don't like that. I and

891
00:52:15,040 --> 00:52:19,360
David Lynch, for the last time, I don't like sexual tones of voice.

892
00:52:19,360 --> 00:52:22,640
Please stop with that. Also, ditch the close-ups.

893
00:52:22,640 --> 00:52:23,640
Stop it.

894
00:52:23,640 --> 00:52:24,640
I don't like close-ups.

895
00:52:24,640 --> 00:52:31,040
Stop it now. No more close-ups and no more things about like your relationship with mommy.

896
00:52:31,040 --> 00:52:32,040
Who's mommy?

897
00:52:32,040 --> 00:52:33,040
Why is your mommy weird to you?

898
00:52:33,040 --> 00:52:38,200
Hey, guess what? You're making me feel awk. I'm feeling awk when I watch these movies

899
00:52:38,200 --> 00:52:40,440
because I'm sitting next to my mommy watching them.

900
00:52:40,440 --> 00:52:41,440
Yeah.

901
00:52:41,440 --> 00:52:42,440
And I'm saying, "Mommy, close your eyes."

902
00:52:42,440 --> 00:52:43,440
Same goes to you.

903
00:52:43,440 --> 00:52:44,440
Same goes to you, Ari Aster.

00:53:09,740 --> 00:53:15,000
fucking afraid. Also, you started your entire career making a movie that is so

910
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:16,340
disgustingly about

911
00:53:16,340 --> 00:53:21,080
father having sex with his older brother. They should literally have called that

912
00:53:21,080 --> 00:53:25,780
movie. There is something weird and wrong about Ari. You know what I would

913
00:53:25,780 --> 00:53:28,520
have called it. That kid fucked his dad. That's what I would have called the

914
00:53:28,520 --> 00:53:30,840
movie because then I wouldn't have watched it. I would have said, oh,

915
00:53:30,840 --> 00:53:33,540
that's a pornographic. I don't want to do it. I named it but not watch it.

916
00:53:33,540 --> 00:53:34,980
Father fucker. Well, that's the kind of

917
00:53:36,140 --> 00:53:41,360

00:53:44,240 --> 00:53:48,780
give you a post. You go there's something about Mary yeah.

920
00:53:48,780 --> 00:53:56,860

921
00:53:56,860 --> 00:53:59,640
there's something, but then they have to go. They have to go and do the the

922
00:53:59,640 --> 00:54:04,340
reshoots right, so they show you this fam this funny or this sweet family movie

923

00:54:18,360 --> 00:54:22,580
avatar sequel to me and then be like we're like we wanted to be the way of

928
00:54:22,580 --> 00:54:26,460
something. We're not really sure way of blue bitch. They're going to be swimming

00:54:37,060 --> 00:54:42,680
and like I don't know if I saw the poster for child's play, I would

934
00:54:42,680 --> 00:54:46,980
immediately call it child's play. Immediately you I call most movies

935
00:54:46,980 --> 00:54:52,060

yeah. Oh my God, can you imagine so I'm assuming the movie name or he names

938
00:55:01,260 --> 00:55:04,320
maybe he has like a quote. He does like maybe five movies a day or whatever

939
00:55:04,320 --> 00:55:07,920
imagine that they bring you child's play and you're like a child, but I guess and

940
00:55:07,920 --> 00:55:13,280
then the rest of the day so easy child's play to play three child's play your

941

crap. Yeah, they're giving you like child's play three

943
00:55:18,880 --> 00:55:24,860
pretty good. I mean I like this movie idea or this idea from a job. Yeah,

944
00:55:24,860 --> 00:55:28,660
yeah, that is a good job. The namer, the namer, they would have an award. They

945
00:55:28,680 --> 00:55:31,720
have different namers and then they would have an award for them at the academy.

946
00:55:31,720 --> 00:55:33,640
How do you qualify for this job though?

947
00:55:33,640 --> 00:55:37,800
It's kind of like it's like how editors have like A.C.E. at the end of their title.

948
00:55:37,800 --> 00:55:43,000
You have to send in a packet where you name a bunch of... they're like, "What would you name a

949
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:48,120
movie that is about a guy fighting another guy?" And you'd be like, "Guy versus guy?"

950
00:55:48,120 --> 00:55:49,080
Yeah.

951
00:55:49,080 --> 00:55:49,880

Fight club.

955
00:55:52,200 --> 00:55:52,920
Fight club.

956
00:55:52,920 --> 00:55:54,120
That's how they came up with that one?

957
00:55:54,120 --> 00:55:54,760
Yeah.

958
00:55:54,760 --> 00:55:56,440
I'd call a movie "Stupid Fucks."

959
00:55:58,520 --> 00:56:02,860

00:58:45,020 --> 00:58:49,220
Who's Caleb? That's people don't know who Caleb is. That's why you watch

1001
00:58:49,220 --> 00:58:53,140
watch a movie to find out who Caleb is okay wait to

1002
00:58:53,140 --> 00:58:58,420
two broadway producers produce a movie a a movie

1003
00:58:58,420 --> 00:59:04,760
box office bomb for insurance purposes, but it ends up being a critical hit the

1004
00:59:04,760 --> 00:59:06,320
bitches the bitches

1005
00:59:06,320 --> 00:59:15,120
the bitches. You can't steal his name the play okay. Well here okay, here's a

1006
00:59:15,120 --> 00:59:16,320
curveball okay

1007
00:59:17,440 --> 00:59:24,940
major league, a young lion is born and gifted the kingdom, but the king, I

1008
00:59:24,940 --> 00:59:26,300
thought when you said a curve hill,

1009
00:59:26,300 --> 00:59:30,740
oh, is this the name? I thought that you said a curve ball. That's the name of

1010
00:59:30,740 --> 00:59:34,220
the movie. Yeah, no, it is okay. That's actually pretty. What's the name of the

1011
00:59:34,220 --> 00:59:34,620
lion

1012
00:59:34,620 --> 00:59:37,060
king

1013
00:59:37,060 --> 00:59:40,400
I don't know

1014
00:59:40,400 --> 00:59:45,280
Mufasa Mufasa story. Actually, that's not his name. Is it now? Which one's

1015
00:59:45,320 --> 00:59:49,920
Mufasa Mufasa is the villain. Oh, no, he's the dad. No scars, the villas,

1016
00:59:49,920 --> 00:59:54,220
oh yeah, scar is not a dad's name scar. Oh, what about okay, wait, but it is a

1017
00:59:54,220 --> 00:59:59,120
name of a very touchy uncle scars attack scars. He doesn't attack him really,

1018
00:59:59,120 --> 01:00:02,480
though he just kind of lets him go. The menace of scar scarred hands, letting go

1019
01:00:02,480 --> 01:00:06,480
is kind of more of the image that you're the way that became the king.

1020
01:00:06,480 --> 01:00:12,720
He is kind of a wimp. It's good. I like that one. The wind who would be king

Okay,

1024
01:00:22,480 --> 01:00:27,880
a clown fish loses it,

1025
01:00:27,880 --> 01:00:32,240
his son. It is just, you can name any movie it.

1026
01:00:32,240 --> 01:00:39,020
Yeah, that's true. Finding Bitch. What the hell? His son is named Nemo. I

1027
01:00:39,020 --> 01:00:43,280
really don't know anymore. This has been going on too long. The Fantabulous

1028
01:00:43,300 --> 01:00:47,600
journey of one Nemo the fish. This has been going on too long. I think we've

1029
01:00:47,600 --> 01:00:51,500
this is an exhausting job. I think I can see you're just you're you're just

1030
01:00:51,500 --> 01:00:54,840
doing badly and you're holding his camera. I think well, I can see the

1031
01:00:54,840 --> 01:00:59,000
fucker that shit. You can't see I concede. Oh, I can see it in the job

1032
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:02,940
that he was in. I couldn't see the best man one.

1033
01:01:02,940 --> 01:01:07,340
And I'm going to go for a movie. The best man one, the best man, one man,

1034
01:01:07,340 --> 01:01:08,980
one, and then they could do the best man to

1035
01:01:12,620 --> 01:01:17,660
Oh yeah, wait Jonah Hill has to go hang out with his wife's. See we were going

1036
01:01:17,660 --> 01:01:19,100
we were going to a movie.

1037
01:01:19,100 --> 01:01:22,900
They should call it. We should have just been going. We should have made the

1038
01:01:22,900 --> 01:01:26,740
movies for, we should have been coming up with movie ideas from the titles,

1039
01:01:26,740 --> 01:01:29,820
from the title. Give me a title then. Reservoir Dogs.

1040
01:01:29,820 --> 01:01:31,860
Reservoir Dogs,

1041
01:01:31,860 --> 01:01:38,580
it's about a group of mangy little pups who are stuck in the Los Angeles River

1042
01:01:38,580 --> 01:01:41,780
and they have to get out of it. Yeah. And there's seven of them and they're

1043
01:01:41,820 --> 01:01:43,820
well named. No, they don't rocky

1044
01:01:43,820 --> 01:01:45,720
Balboa

1045
01:01:45,720 --> 01:01:48,420
Benden Franklin

1046
01:01:48,420 --> 01:01:53,020
chrysanthemum. That's the girl. He's just trying to prove that he can name

1047
01:01:53,020 --> 01:01:56,620
stuff because he failed so badly, badly, wimpy, failed badly. Now, we'll end

1048
01:01:56,620 --> 01:02:00,820
that in the grinch

1049
01:02:00,820 --> 01:02:03,820
