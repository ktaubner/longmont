We're turning up the decibels of the podcast at least twice as much.

13
00:00:32,300 --> 00:00:35,300
We're stoking loud this year. We're smoking loud.

14
00:00:35,300 --> 00:00:40,300
Alright, first things first, we need to apologize for not having an episode for...

15
00:00:40,300 --> 00:00:41,300
No we don't.

16
00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:43,300
I feel like we should apologize to the fans.

17
00:00:43,300 --> 00:00:44,300
We don't owe you guys shit.

18
00:00:44,300 --> 00:00:47,300
Patrick, you can apologize, let it be known me and Cameron refuse to apologize.

19
00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:48,300
Don't give a fuck.

20
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:49,300
I... look...

21
00:00:49,300 --> 00:00:50,300
Don't care.

22
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:52,300
I care about the fans.

23
00:00:52,300 --> 00:00:53,300
I care about...

24
00:00:53,300 --> 00:00:54,300
That's lame.

25
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:55,300
Why?

26
00:00:55,300 --> 00:00:56,300
I care about food.

27
00:00:56,300 --> 00:01:03,300
Why is that lame? Why is caring about the fans lame?

28
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:04,300
Because you're a pussy.

29
00:01:04,300 --> 00:01:06,300
It's actually not true.

30
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:08,300
It's only lame if Patrick does it.

31
00:01:08,300 --> 00:01:12,300
Yeah, exactly. Anything Patrick does is stupid, fat.

32
00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:14,300
(laughs)

33
00:01:14,300 --> 00:01:17,300
Yeah, like you.

34
00:01:17,300 --> 00:01:20,300
Yes! Yes!

35
00:01:20,300 --> 00:01:22,300
Shit! Yes!

36
00:01:22,300 --> 00:01:24,300

37
00:01:24,300 --> 00:01:26,300
How's the holidays?

38
00:01:26,300 --> 00:01:28,300
It's pretty good.

39
00:01:28,300 --> 00:01:30,300
It's fine?

40
00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:32,300

48
00:01:46,300 --> 00:01:48,300
He was sharing with me.

00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:50,300
I got some Reese's cups.

50
00:01:50,300 --> 00:01:52,300
Patrick got gummy bears and Twizzlers.

51
00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:58,220
pound box of Twizzlers. Five pounds? Well no Dom got a five pound box of Twizzlers.

52
00:01:58,220 --> 00:02:06,740
I got like a small box of tiny gummy bears. Oh so you didn't get any Twizzlers?

53
00:02:06,740 --> 00:02:11,420
I didn't get any Twizzlers but I have. But he's been eating them. You've been

Oh my God, dude.

59
00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:24,460
We're the same guy.

60
00:02:24,460 --> 00:02:25,460
Oh my goodness.

61
00:02:25,460 --> 00:02:26,460
What shoes did you get?

62
00:02:26,460 --> 00:02:30,100
Oh, Santa accidentally got us the same thing because he thought we were the same guy again

63
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:31,100
this year.

64
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:32,180
Fuck, dude.

65
00:02:32,180 --> 00:02:33,180
What are your shoes?

66
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:34,740
I don't know.

67
00:02:34,740 --> 00:02:38,020
Some Nikes from the Nike Outlet Factory store.

68
00:02:38,020 --> 00:02:41,460
They're already falling apart and they have a stain on them.

69
00:02:41,460 --> 00:02:42,460
Damn.

70
00:02:42,460 --> 00:02:43,460
Damn.

71
00:02:43,460 --> 00:02:44,460
Damn, brother.

72
00:02:44,460 --> 00:02:45,460
Damn, brother.

73
00:02:45,460 --> 00:02:46,460
Damn.

74
00:02:46,460 --> 00:02:47,460
Damn.

75
00:02:47,460 --> 00:02:51,460
I got a bunch of iTunes gift cards that I'm trying to resell.

76
00:02:51,460 --> 00:02:52,820
It's a fucking pain in the ass.

77
00:02:52,820 --> 00:02:55,820
Don't know how to resell them.

78
00:02:55,820 --> 00:03:00,460
Why don't you just go to that website?

79
00:03:00,460 --> 00:03:01,220
What website?

80
00:03:01,220 --> 00:03:02,740
Brazzers.

81
00:03:02,740 --> 00:03:04,660
Oh, I can go to Brazzers.com.

82
00:03:04,660 --> 00:03:07,780
You could turn the iTunes gift cards into one month of Brazzers.

83
00:03:07,780 --> 00:03:09,460
Into a Brazzers cash.

84
00:03:09,460 --> 00:03:12,820
Did you ever know anybody in middle school who--

85
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:16,260
I had five friends who all shared a Brazzers account.

86
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:20,420
So, shit, I put my mouth too close to the mic.

87
00:03:20,420 --> 00:03:24,500
But my sister's,

88
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:28,300
one of my sister's ex-boyfriends gave me

89
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:30,740
and my little brother a Brazzers password

90
00:03:30,740 --> 00:03:32,980
that was owned by him and the rest of the people

91
00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:34,580
in his fraternity.

92
00:03:34,580 --> 00:03:38,060
And my younger brother gave it to his friend Taylor,

93
00:03:38,060 --> 00:03:42,700
and Taylor gave it out to all of London Dairy Middle School.

94
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:44,900
So the account got shut down

95
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:48,820
because too many people were logging in.

96
00:03:48,820 --> 00:03:55,820
That's awesome. It's amazing to me that people pay for porn. I know. Yeah just make it

97
00:03:55,820 --> 00:03:59,420

00:08:33,340 --> 00:08:38,900
like the Koopas do. Yeah. Yeah, when you take the Koopas shell off. They're wearing freaking

176
00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:46,340
boxers they're wearing the heart-shaped boxers and the heart heart pattern boxers

177
00:08:46,340 --> 00:08:55,020
pattern boxers and they're yeah what what this is so not sexy I'm not turned on

179
00:09:01,780 --> 00:09:06,900
movie because boys should find parts on them yeah oh so under their clothes

180
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:12,060
they're gay. Exactly. Whoa. The Koopa's small yellow penis would be

181
00:09:12,060 --> 00:09:15,900
indistinguishable from Bart Simpsons in the Simpsons movie. Well yeah he's

182
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:20,340
flipping off the camera. It's yeah. No that's not true. The Koopa's penis is Bart's hands.

183
00:09:20,340 --> 00:09:24,980
It's a theory that it's his Bart's penis but it's actually he's

184
00:09:24,980 --> 00:09:31,820
flipping off. It's not a theory it's clearly his penis. It's a no. It is. I'm

185
00:09:31,820 --> 00:09:36,300
saying that but there's a theory. There's a theory that he's flipping off the

186
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:43,460
camera? Uh-huh. Okay. It's a false theory. Is that like, would that hold up in court? No, but it's a theory.

187
00:09:43,460 --> 00:09:48,180
Exactly. I was flipping them off with my penis. Look, people make theories about the

188
00:09:48,180 --> 00:09:53,260
shining, they make theories about... That's true. I love all the Rugrats theories. Yeah, have you ever considered...

189
00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:59,500

205
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:31,280
that's right that's the noise it would make when Patrick went into his shell

206
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:58,160
would be yeah cuz I'm flying nope soaping wet yeah me and Patrick don't go to

Yeah, no it fucking blows dude.

213
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:37,280
I have to figure out, because I wasn't going to justify doing CCC for $35,000.

214
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:40,280
Yeah, that's smart.

215
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:45,280
Yeah, I can just work on it from the shadows. I can just send in scripts.

216
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:47,280
You could be a shadowy figure behind the scenes.

217
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:49,280
Patrick should go into the shadows.

218
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:51,280
Yeah, I'll be the phantom.

219
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:52,280
Yeah.

220
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:54,280

225
00:12:58,280 --> 00:12:59,280
I'm excited to be not in school anymore.

226
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:06,440
Definitely have a lot of money to pay back to the U.S. government, but I'm hoping to

227
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:13,720
be conscripted and I can die for Israel in lieu of paying all of my money.

228
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:14,720
Me too.

229
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:15,720
Yeah.

230
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:16,720
That'd be pretty nice.

231
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:20,920
Look, I made a resolution for 2020 that I'm no longer going to be practicing any Jewish

232
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:21,920
holidays.

233
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:31,880
That was your... That's my resolution. Yeah? It was... I was doing it last year and it

234
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:36,780
was really hard to get Jewish families to let me into their home to help them

235
00:13:36,780 --> 00:13:44,880
celebrate. Yeah. And none of my Jewish friends would let me. I want to help you celebrate. I would like to help you celebrate

236
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:46,240
Passover, ma'am.

00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:56,960
- Ma'am, let me look at your hand.

247
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:57,800

- You need my Gentile's touch.

254
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:09,920
- Listen, we've never let a Gentile

255
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:11,340
put on a holy high holiday.

256
00:14:11,340 --> 00:14:13,840
I'm just saying, what could happen?

257
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:15,480

448
00:25:15,620 --> 00:25:18,820

449
00:25:18,820 --> 00:25:20,820

00:25:20,820 --> 00:25:22,820
You know the stories are fake.

451
00:25:22,820 --> 00:25:24,820
The guy was just like...

452
00:25:24,820 --> 00:25:26,820
Oh you don't have any money? You can pay in something else.

453

Dude, I would have.

454
00:25:28,820 --> 00:25:30,820
$300 is so much money to me right now.

455
00:25:30,820 --> 00:25:32,820
But the guy, he was just like

"Oh that's really cool man.

457
00:25:34,820 --> 00:25:36,820
You have to pay $300 now."

458
00:25:36,820 --> 00:25:38,820
And he also made me plead

459
00:25:38,820 --> 00:25:40,820
guilty or not guilty on the spot.

460
00:25:40,820 --> 00:25:42,820

462
00:25:44,820 --> 00:25:46,820

Yeah, no cuz I smoke I smoke

Do we talk about that last time but yeah Patrick is obsessed with the fact that he smokes weed now

539
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:03,840
No, because it's funny.

540
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:06,080
It is funny that you thought you were allergic.

541
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:11,080
Yeah, I'm just I need to I'm a fucking terrible hypochondriac.

542
00:32:11,080 --> 00:32:13,800
Yeah, I like I don't know I

543
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:18,360
There there have been times where I thought I had autism for like

544
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:21,080
two years

545
00:32:21,080 --> 00:32:24,520
Because I took a test online and

546
00:32:25,520 --> 00:32:28,320
and all of my symptoms lined up,

547
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:29,820
and then I just realized, like,

548
00:32:29,820 --> 00:32:32,560
oh no, it's 'cause I'm taking Adderall.

549
00:32:32,560 --> 00:32:35,660
Of course I get focused on one thing for too long.

550
00:32:35,660 --> 00:32:37,640
- 2020, I'm going back on Adderall.

551
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:38,480
- Yeah? - Yeah.

552
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:40,440
- Yeah, why's that?

553
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:42,680
- So I can write and draw.

554
00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:45,360
- Nice, I might steal my little brother's Adderall.

555
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:47,440
- I can get you Adderall, dude.

556
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:49,760
- I can go back on it whenever I want.

557
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:51,040
- I'm too scared of Adderall, actually.

558
00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:52,480
I think it'll make my heart explode.

559
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:54,280
- Yeah, that's the one thing.

560
00:32:54,280 --> 00:32:59,160
heart was getting dangerous for a while. I'll take it. I've probably said this

561
00:32:59,160 --> 00:33:03,640
before yeah no one time I went to the doctor for like a checkup and I had just

562
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:06,880
taken Adderall and like climbed a flight of stairs and they listened to my heart

563
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:12,760
and they were like what are you okay? What is wrong with you? Are you a superhero?

564
00:33:12,760 --> 00:33:15,280
And I was like I just like went up the stairs and they were like your heart

565
00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:20,240
should not be beating this fast ever. That's so funny just to go into the

566
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:28,320
doctor's medial like oh my god you're right go home

567
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:31,080
yeah they're like I should probably get that checked out and I like you're the

568
00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:35,560
doctor what do you have like an arrhythmia or something no I just have I

569
00:33:35,560 --> 00:33:40,960
just was take I take an insane amount of Adderall okay or I did yeah I don't has

570
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:45,440

571
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:47,880
and Dom's been drinking espresso,

572
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:51,840
and then she'll get like, extremely nervous,

573
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:54,160
and then she'll be like, "Why, what is going on?"

574
00:33:54,160 --> 00:33:57,160
And I'm like, "You just drank like so much espresso."

575
00:33:57,160 --> 00:34:01,020
- I've been pretty low on caffeine since I've been here,

576
00:34:01,020 --> 00:34:03,680
which has been, I've been weaning myself off,

577
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:05,800
but I have about a cup a day right now.

578
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:07,320
- I haven't done anything.

579
00:34:07,320 --> 00:34:10,360
- Yeah, I've stopped nicotine.

580
00:34:10,360 --> 00:34:11,920
- Yeah. - Nice, me too.

581
00:34:11,920 --> 00:34:14,920
- Yeah, I mean, I've mostly stopped nicotine.

582
00:34:14,920 --> 00:34:17,320
I've replaced it with weed now.

583
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:20,160
- Yeah, I just accidentally stopped nicotine.

584
00:34:20,160 --> 00:34:21,440
I just didn't buy any.

585
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:22,840
- It's pretty easy, honestly.

586
00:34:22,840 --> 00:34:24,320
I don't want people to complain about it.

587
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:26,920
- Yeah, it's the easiest thing in the world for me.

588
00:34:26,920 --> 00:34:27,760
- Yeah.

589
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:30,360
- Yeah, everyone who can't quit smoking is just a pussy.

590
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:31,200
- Fucking idiot.

591
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:32,640
- Just kind of a pussy, kind of a loser.

592
00:34:32,640 --> 00:34:33,480
- Yeah.

593
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:34,520
- And we don't respect you.

594
00:34:34,520 --> 00:34:35,520
- Kind of a bobo.

595
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:36,800
Kind of a bobo chimp.

596
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:38,240
- Kind of a bobozo.

597
00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:39,160
- Bobo the chimp.

598
00:34:39,160 --> 00:34:41,160
- Bobo cervix, the chimp.

599
00:34:41,160 --> 00:34:43,000
- Bobo cervix.

600
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:44,200
- Yeah.

601
00:34:44,200 --> 00:34:46,200
Hello, I'm Bobo Cervix!

602
00:34:46,200 --> 00:34:47,200
UGH!

603
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:50,200
Can I drive in the passenger seat of your car?

604
00:34:50,200 --> 00:34:52,200
Can I inspect your cervix?

605
00:34:52,200 --> 00:34:54,200
From the outside!

606
00:34:54,200 --> 00:34:56,200
Why are you guys doing your own voices?

607
00:34:56,200 --> 00:34:57,200
What?

608
00:34:57,200 --> 00:34:58,200
Cause that's how you talk.

609
00:34:58,200 --> 00:34:59,200
That's how you talk.

610
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:01,200
That's how you guys sound.

611
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:04,200
Hello, it's me, Caleb!

612
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:07,200
You're not doing your own voice because your own voice sounds like this!

613
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:08,200
No.

614
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:12,200
I'm Caleb and I need to get some batteries at the store.

615
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:14,200
I don't need any batteries. My new year's resolution is to-

616
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:17,200
I don't need all my toys came with batteries for Christmas.

617
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:21,200
I need 16 packs that don't sell AAAs!

618
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:24,200
Why? What am I gonna use 16 packs for?

619
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:26,200
I have a coupon!

620
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:27,200
A coupon?

621
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:30,200
I'm not gonna use the batteries, I just like how they look.

622
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:32,200
I don't care- Batteries are the most boring designs.

623
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:35,200
I throw them at the kids in the neighborhood who are bad.

624
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:36,200
I don't care- There's no kids in my neighborhood.

625
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:39,200
I make a delicious salad that's batteries and coins.

626
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:44,440
coins. No, that's not that doesn't sound delicious. It's not even a salad

627
00:35:44,440 --> 00:35:50,320
battery coin salad. That's to be addressing or some sort of oil for

628
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:55,120
digged count as a salad. You guys put water. I skim water from the top of

629
00:35:55,120 --> 00:35:59,320
the toilet tank. I don't do that. Patrick drinks out of the toilet

630
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:02,640
because he thinks that's where babies are come from and he's waiting for

631
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:08,200
one of my batteries in my salad. No, that of course I don't put croutons

632
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:12,200
in my salad or I mean I put batteries in my salad.

633
00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:13,160
- You put batteries in your salad.

634
00:36:13,160 --> 00:36:14,960
- No, I don't put either in my salad.

635
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:18,800
The only thing I, no, not, oh my God, I'm gonna hang up.

636
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:20,320
- Don't hang up, please.

637
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:21,280
- Okay, fine.

638
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:22,680
- Please, no. - I'm not gonna hang up.

639
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:24,000
Not.

640
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,960
- If you hang up, it'll make this awful to edit,

641
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:27,160
so please don't.

642
00:36:27,160 --> 00:36:28,400
- Okay.

643
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:30,760
Will you guys stop making fun of me?

644
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:32,920
- Okay, okay.

645
00:36:32,920 --> 00:36:33,760
- Thanks.

646
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:37,120
Sometimes all you gotta do is ask.

647
00:36:37,120 --> 00:36:39,580
(laughter)

648
00:36:39,580 --> 00:36:42,080
I did one of the worst shows of my entire life in Atlanta,

649
00:36:42,080 --> 00:36:43,200
which was super fun.

650
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:44,040
Yeah.

651
00:36:44,040 --> 00:36:45,060
Nice, oh yeah, how was the tour?

652
00:36:45,060 --> 00:36:47,640
Yeah, talk about your tour, you fucking idiot.

653
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:49,320
Why are you so quiet all of a sudden?

654
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:50,400
'Cause.

655
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:52,880
A lot of the dates fell through,

656
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:54,960
so most of it was just a road trip,

657
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:56,480
but we did some dates.

658
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:57,480
Was it just you and Gus?

659
00:36:57,480 --> 00:36:59,800
You and Gus had some dates.

660
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:01,360
Yeah, me and Gus went on a lot of dates.

661
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:02,720
Neil dropped out?

662
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:03,960
Yeah, Neil dropped out.

663
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:06,320
We listened to all of Serial,

664
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:08,000
which was good.

665
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:08,840
It was as good as I remember it the first time.

666
00:37:08,840 --> 00:37:10,720
- Do you like the music for Cereal?

667
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:13,200
The theme song?

668
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:14,640
- It's pretty repetitive, but yeah.

669
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:16,080
- I like some of those clutches.

670
00:37:16,080 --> 00:37:18,000
- The guy from the Unicorns

671
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,360
composed all the music for Cereal.

672
00:37:20,360 --> 00:37:21,480
- It's definitely catchy.

"Where a kid can be a kid"

684
00:37:36,660 --> 00:37:39,440
"Where a kid can be a star now" is what they say.

685
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:40,200
Really?

686
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:43,120
Yeah. "Where a kid can be a star!"

687
00:37:43,120 --> 00:37:44,440
Did they really say that?

688
00:37:44,440 --> 00:37:45,820
Yeah, they changed it to that.

689
00:37:45,820 --> 00:37:47,120
Why?

690
00:37:47,120 --> 00:37:50,820
Uh, because kids didn't want to be kids, they wanted to be stars.

691
00:37:50,820 --> 00:37:51,860
Stupid.

692
00:37:51,860 --> 00:37:55,860
A kid can be a kid anywhere. A kid can only be a star at Chuck E.'s Cheeses.

693
00:37:55,860 --> 00:37:58,320
"Where Caleb can be a bitch"

694
00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:00,200
"Where Cameron looks at kids"

695
00:38:00,200 --> 00:38:03,500
So where did your tour take you?

696
00:38:03,500 --> 00:38:05,640
uh... we did

697
00:38:05,640 --> 00:38:07,880
we did albuquerque

698
00:38:07,880 --> 00:38:09,700
and how does that show go

699
00:38:09,700 --> 00:38:15,320
there was no show there we slept at albuquerque in albuquerque at a motel

700
00:38:15,320 --> 00:38:17,320
uh... motel six

701
00:38:17,320 --> 00:38:19,140
woke up got a ticket

702
00:38:19,140 --> 00:38:20,180
then drove

703
00:38:20,180 --> 00:38:25,100
to uh... uh... we were going to go to dallas because we were supposed to have a show

704
00:38:25,100 --> 00:38:29,420
there the show did not materialize and did not happen

705
00:38:29,420 --> 00:38:32,780
And so we were like, oh, we don't want to get a fucking Dallas. Let's go to Austin

706
00:38:32,780 --> 00:38:35,660
ended up staying with a

707
00:38:35,660 --> 00:38:39,760
very powerful Republican politician in Austin

708
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:43,760
Because he was like a college friend of my mom

709
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:46,020
Wow

710
00:38:46,020 --> 00:38:49,940
That was bizarre. He was not friendly as you could probably imagine

711
00:38:49,940 --> 00:38:54,500
And then we went to Atlanta the next day or no

712
00:38:54,500 --> 00:38:59,000
we went to New Orleans the next day, went to like this old, old pool hall in New

713
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:02,600
Orleans and ended up, I think me and Gus are going back to New

714
00:39:02,600 --> 00:39:07,720
Orleans. We like talked to this old dude who's like owned a club at the pool

715
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:11,440
hall and I think me and Gus are gonna try to go back to New Orleans in March

716
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:17,920
and do a weekend of shows at like a New Orleans black comedy club. Nice. You should

717
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:24,280
bring Patrick to do his voice okay Patrick do the voice yeah occasion

718
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:32,160

719
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:41,680

720
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:45,760
we're gonna do that I will announce those dates when we have them and then

721
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:53,920
did Atlanta. I sucked up a gator. Terrible bar. And then we did my hometown which was another

722
00:39:53,920 --> 00:40:01,160
terrible show. So all together. What happened in Atlanta? Atlanta it was just like a show

723
00:40:01,160 --> 00:40:07,120
where they had like five lotto spots on this show so like every shitty comedian in the city

724
00:40:07,120 --> 00:40:11,320
was there but not watching the show they were just like waiting for the lotto spots and

725
00:40:11,320 --> 00:40:15,320
And then there was like six audience members who were just like college students.

726
00:40:15,320 --> 00:40:16,320
Damn.

727
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:17,820
Yeah, it was a really bad one.

728
00:40:17,820 --> 00:40:19,320
Were you booked on it?

729
00:40:19,320 --> 00:40:20,320
Yeah, yeah.

730
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:22,820
Gus did one of the craziest sets I've ever seen.

731
00:40:22,820 --> 00:40:23,820
Yeah.

732
00:40:23,820 --> 00:40:28,320
Where Gus did like, he did like a quarter of his set just doing normal jokes.

733
00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:34,320
And then introduced the idea of like some guy named Sully.

734
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:36,320
And he was like, "Oh, you guys don't know Sully?"

735
00:40:36,320 --> 00:40:42,040
And he just like yelled at everyone in the audience for not knowing who Sully was.

736
00:40:42,040 --> 00:40:46,360
And then he like got off stage and then I went up and then he was like, "We have to leave

737
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:49,340
immediately because this was crazy."

738
00:40:49,340 --> 00:40:53,540
And then we just drove through the night to my hometown.

739
00:40:53,540 --> 00:40:56,580
Got in at like six in the morning and I've been here since then.

740
00:40:56,580 --> 00:40:58,220
I'm here for so much longer.

741
00:40:58,220 --> 00:40:59,220
Yeah.

742
00:40:59,220 --> 00:41:00,220
Damn.

743
00:41:00,220 --> 00:41:03,620
What time do you get back?

744
00:41:03,620 --> 00:41:05,300
I think the 11th or the 12th.

745
00:41:05,300 --> 00:41:06,300
to the city.

746
00:41:06,300 --> 00:41:07,300
Yeah, to the city.

747
00:41:07,300 --> 00:41:08,300

748
00:41:08,300 --> 00:41:12,580

No, she has to take my, she has to take my surname.

767
00:41:32,260 --> 00:41:35,260
When we get married.

768
00:41:35,260 --> 00:41:38,540
That's so funny. I don't know, that got me.

769
00:41:38,540 --> 00:41:41,500
Dry Jana and wet wife.

770
00:41:41,500 --> 00:41:43,500
Dry Jana and wet wife.

771
00:41:43,500 --> 00:41:48,060
So here's something that me and Patrick were talking about.

772
00:41:48,060 --> 00:41:49,900
What about flavored wipes?

773
00:41:49,900 --> 00:41:50,860
Oh yeah.

774
00:41:50,860 --> 00:41:52,860
Isn't that a good idea?

775
00:41:52,860 --> 00:41:54,860
And you can taste it through your ass.

776
00:41:54,860 --> 00:41:59,260
Or whatever surface. You can wipe down your counter and then lick your counter.

777
00:41:59,260 --> 00:42:01,260
I feel like you first, you like...

778
00:42:01,260 --> 00:42:02,460
Yeah.

779
00:42:02,460 --> 00:42:06,140
Like if you eat a bunch of like barbecue sauce, you can wipe your

780
00:42:06,140 --> 00:42:08,820
mouth with it and it tastes like, like grapes.

781
00:42:08,820 --> 00:42:11,980
Or more barbecue sauce.

782
00:42:11,980 --> 00:42:15,420
If you wipe your mouth with barbecue sauce, it'll taste like

783
00:42:15,420 --> 00:42:15,940
grapes.

784
00:42:15,940 --> 00:42:21,300
No, listen, you eat barbecue or like maybe some buffalo wings and

785
00:42:21,300 --> 00:42:24,860
then you get one of the wet wipes that are flavored like the thing

786
00:42:24,860 --> 00:42:25,620
you just ate.

787
00:42:25,620 --> 00:42:27,060
Yeah, your wipes.

788
00:42:27,060 --> 00:42:28,100
Your wipes.

789
00:42:28,100 --> 00:42:28,980
No, your wipes.

790
00:42:28,980 --> 00:42:30,060
Yeah, they're yours.

791
00:42:30,060 --> 00:42:31,100
Yeah, they're your wipes.

792
00:42:31,100 --> 00:42:32,180
Yeah, they're your wipes.

793
00:42:32,180 --> 00:42:33,460
Yeah, they're your wipes.

794
00:42:33,460 --> 00:42:35,060
Yeah, they're Patrick's wet wipes.

795
00:42:35,060 --> 00:42:36,500
They're Caleb's wipes.

796
00:42:36,500 --> 00:42:37,700
Nah, they're wet wipes.

797
00:42:37,700 --> 00:42:38,700
They're Patrick's wet wipes.

798
00:42:38,700 --> 00:42:40,180
That's why they're called wet wipes.

799
00:42:40,180 --> 00:42:41,780
Wet wipes, wet wipes.

800
00:42:41,780 --> 00:42:43,300

801
00:42:43,300 --> 00:42:44,700

808
00:42:51,940 --> 00:42:53,380
Wipe, wipe, wipe.

809

00:42:55,580 --> 00:42:58,780

811
00:42:58,780 --> 00:42:59,620

- Oh, yeah, Caleb, you're the Koosbanian Foob.

866
00:46:19,480 --> 00:46:21,480
- You're the Koosbanian Foob.

867
00:46:21,480 --> 00:46:22,320
- That's his name.

868
00:46:22,320 --> 00:46:23,480
- You're the Koosbanian Foob.

869
00:46:23,480 --> 00:46:25,000
- You're the Foosbanian Coob.

870
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:27,520
- I don't even know what you're saying at this point.

871
00:46:27,520 --> 00:46:29,200
- You're the Koosbanian Foob, dude.

872
00:46:29,200 --> 00:46:30,640
- I don't, that makes no sense to me.

873
00:46:30,640 --> 00:46:32,680
I told you guys, I just confessed on the podcast

874
00:46:32,680 --> 00:46:35,400
that I have now punched a woman in the face.

875
00:46:35,400 --> 00:46:37,040
- Oh, what?

876
00:46:37,040 --> 00:46:37,880
Huh? - Yeah.

877
00:46:37,880 --> 00:46:39,960
- What?

878
00:46:39,960 --> 00:46:43,160
- I punched a woman in the face over Christmas break.

879
00:46:43,160 --> 00:46:44,680
- You said that, when did you confess?

880
00:46:44,680 --> 00:46:46,320
You just confessed that now?

881
00:46:46,320 --> 00:46:48,160
- Yeah. - Why?

882
00:46:48,160 --> 00:46:49,680
- Oh, no, no, no.

883
00:46:49,680 --> 00:46:52,800
Yeah, 'cause you got into that bar fight with Josh.

884
00:46:52,800 --> 00:46:54,040
- Yeah. - Oh.

885
00:46:54,040 --> 00:46:56,520
- How many details are we allowed to talk about on this?

886
00:46:56,520 --> 00:46:57,800
- I don't know because--

887
00:46:57,800 --> 00:46:59,280
- We've already talked about it, I thought.

888
00:46:59,280 --> 00:47:01,240
- I know we did. - We definitely have.

889
00:47:01,240 --> 00:47:04,240
- We just talked about it in the TELVR text.

890
00:47:04,240 --> 00:47:05,400
We didn't talk about it on the show,

891
00:47:05,400 --> 00:47:07,040
'cause we haven't recorded an episode since then.

892
00:47:07,040 --> 00:47:11,600
- Because I don't wanna say the bar

893
00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:21,800
because people involved were afraid that there was going to be like a warrant out for us.

894
00:47:21,800 --> 00:47:26,640
It was a bad one. But the only thing that I will divulge is that I did punch a woman

895
00:47:26,640 --> 00:47:34,800
in the face because she was square and I was like, "I'll take a gamble on this."

896
00:47:34,800 --> 00:47:36,920
She was square? What do you mean?

897
00:47:36,920 --> 00:47:44,840
She had a Minecraft Steve blockhead and was close to 7,000 pounds.

898
00:47:44,840 --> 00:47:47,640
And at first I didn't know she was a woman.

899
00:47:47,640 --> 00:47:52,560
And I'm sorry that I misgendered her and punched her in the face.

900
00:47:52,560 --> 00:47:56,280
I thought that you said that you just punched a woman right now.

901
00:47:56,280 --> 00:47:58,240
No, no, no.

902
00:47:58,240 --> 00:48:02,480
I would though, if she was here again.

903
00:48:02,480 --> 00:48:03,480
I would take her down.

904
00:48:03,480 --> 00:48:05,080
Would you punch Crendle?

905
00:48:05,080 --> 00:48:12,920
I would, oh yeah, Crendle from Waffle House, I would not punch. I would only ever make love to her and treat her like the princess that she deserves to be.

906
00:48:12,920 --> 00:48:15,240
The princess of the Orc Kingdom.

907
00:48:15,240 --> 00:48:21,240
Yeah, I mean we can't talk about it in any other length, but that story's crazy.

908
00:48:21,240 --> 00:48:24,000
Yeah, it was stupid.

909
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:24,960
Yeah.

910
00:48:24,960 --> 00:48:28,120
Well, I mean, if you change all the names I think you can go into it.

911
00:48:28,120 --> 00:48:30,360
Basically, Caleb went into this cantina.

912
00:48:30,360 --> 00:48:34,800
And there was a green robot alien named Gribin.

913
00:48:34,800 --> 00:48:42,080
green yeah Robin groban groban Caleb shot and grobel shot at the same time and he

914
00:48:42,080 --> 00:48:51,640
said make funky and they yeah died and there's an alien named gobbles and I

915
00:48:51,640 --> 00:48:56,720
and I punched her in the face there's an alien named Crandall yeah

916
00:48:56,720 --> 00:48:57,880
Yeah, Crendle the alien.

917
00:48:57,880 --> 00:48:58,880
Crendle of Kreenis.

918
00:48:58,880 --> 00:48:59,880
Yeah.

919
00:48:59,880 --> 00:49:05,840
But yeah, so, Gus, I'll just say this.

920
00:49:05,840 --> 00:49:10,160
The funniest part of the story is just that Gus doesn't know what he, the way that the

921
00:49:10,160 --> 00:49:15,760
fight started was he walked up to somebody, he was very drunk, he walked up to somebody,

922
00:49:15,760 --> 00:49:20,880
said something, and then just the guy punched him in the face and then started kicking him

923
00:49:20,880 --> 00:49:24,280
in the head while he was on the ground.

924
00:49:24,280 --> 00:49:26,360
And just, his head probably still hurts.

925
00:49:26,360 --> 00:49:33,240
was like three weeks ago but and I Gus has no idea what he said he has no clue

926
00:49:33,240 --> 00:49:36,440
what he told this guy I just came out of the bathroom and people were hitting

927
00:49:36,440 --> 00:49:42,920
each other in the head with pool balls Jesus Christ yeah really there's really

928
00:49:42,920 --> 00:49:47,680
bad what if you say the name of the place and then Cameron that censors it I

929
00:49:47,680 --> 00:49:55,480
will not I don't think it matters where it was it was Denny's yeah

930
00:49:55,480 --> 00:49:59,680
pool hall. Yeah, some of the denny's have full bars in California.

931
00:49:59,680 --> 00:50:02,520
There wasn't, no, there wasn't, it wasn't a pool hall, people just brought their own pool

932
00:50:02,520 --> 00:50:05,520
balls to look at and hang out. Yeah, that's true.

933
00:50:05,520 --> 00:50:10,240
You see this thing? It's 100% ivory. It says 8 on it.

934
00:50:10,240 --> 00:50:17,240
Yeah. This one's the black ball. You never hit this fucking ball unless you need to.

935
00:50:17,240 --> 00:50:23,240
Um, yeah, what else? What else happened?

936
00:50:23,240 --> 00:50:26,920
happened? I don't know man. I feel like it's been so long I don't even remember.

937
00:50:26,920 --> 00:50:32,120
On December 23rd, I went to the mall in Newton and they had a big sculpture of a

938
00:50:32,120 --> 00:50:38,280
bunch of naked children in a pot. What? In a giant pot. Well, it was like a

939
00:50:38,280 --> 00:50:41,760
sculpture. It was like it was a round. It was a big like bronze sculpture. It was

940
00:50:41,760 --> 00:50:45,560
like this round thing. It looked like a bunch of like little girls like

941
00:50:45,560 --> 00:50:50,400
leaning over a wall, like leaning outward and over a circular wall and then

942
00:50:50,400 --> 00:50:53,440
we were on the second floor of the mall and I was looking down and they're all

943
00:50:53,440 --> 00:50:57,480
naked like you can see from above they all have their their asses are out and

944
00:50:57,480 --> 00:51:02,000
then I was like this is like some kind of crazy like like Epstein sculpture you

945
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:04,920
know this is like a Moloch thing and I went down and looked at it and it was

946
00:51:04,920 --> 00:51:10,360
right next to- Louis CK is from Newton. Oh my god. Oh no. But it was right next to the like

947
00:51:10,360 --> 00:51:15,120
take your picture of Santa thing and so they had taped up on this like this like

948
00:51:15,120 --> 00:51:19,320
child sacrifice sculpture just like a piece of printer paper and on it written

949
00:51:19,320 --> 00:51:31,000
in marker it just said happy Hanukkah. Oh that's so fucking funny. It didn't have like a like

950
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:35,660
a plaque that said it literally had nothing. It had no we tried to look it up could not

951
00:51:35,660 --> 00:51:41,080
find any information about it. It was really we should go look at it. It's creepy as fuck.

952
00:51:41,080 --> 00:51:47,360
It's pretty close to Newton I guess. Yeah Caleb will drive us. Yeah. I'll drive you.

953
00:51:47,360 --> 00:51:51,400
I'm gonna have a car yeah yeah dude we can we're gonna go to the new this is the

954
00:51:51,400 --> 00:51:55,600
this is the year we go to the New Hampshire reptile Expo yeah when is it

955
00:51:55,600 --> 00:52:02,920
there it happens like monthly I think yeah yeah I because I get recommendations

956
00:52:02,920 --> 00:52:07,880
for all the time yeah and it seems like they must be it's either like monthly or

957
00:52:07,880 --> 00:52:16,720
weekly it's ridiculously I got a gecko I should probably go yeah well Oh fucking

958
00:52:16,720 --> 00:52:25,720
And so I think it was like New Year's Day or New Year's Eve.

959
00:52:25,720 --> 00:52:30,600
I went to Chipotle in Manchester because it's like the only, there's only like a few restaurants

960
00:52:30,600 --> 00:52:34,160
that have like vegan food in New Hampshire.

961
00:52:34,160 --> 00:52:42,000
And I went to the Chipotle and I was kind of fucked up because I was like, I was pre-gaming

962
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:45,280
but no one knew I was pre-gaming.

963
00:52:45,280 --> 00:52:52,640
I was kind of fucked up and I like walked into like the Chipotle, I was walking in and there

964
00:52:52,640 --> 00:52:57,360
was just a car alarm going off and I just like sat there and I just kind of stared at the

965
00:52:57,360 --> 00:53:01,400
car alarm for a little bit or the car going off because I was like what the fuck's going

966
00:53:01,400 --> 00:53:06,360
on and then I hear "Hey Pat!" and it's my cop cousin.

967
00:53:06,360 --> 00:53:07,360
Nice.

968
00:53:07,360 --> 00:53:12,780
And I like freaked out a little bit but then I just like needed a diversion so I pointed

969
00:53:12,780 --> 00:53:18,700
at the car alarm the car that was going off and I was just like is that your car

970
00:53:18,700 --> 00:53:29,180
and he's like no that's not mine okay I'll see you later. Fuck yeah, hanging out with family has been awesome.

971
00:53:29,180 --> 00:53:34,980
Oh I went to a soy party too. Oh yeah nice in Baltimore. Yeah in Baltimore I have

972
00:53:34,980 --> 00:53:40,260
family in Baltimore and they are their friends are all just like like 2000s

973
00:53:40,260 --> 00:53:44,720
hipsters yeah like it's insane. There's a guy who had a chaos tattoo on one arm

974
00:53:44,720 --> 00:53:48,320
and what I assume is the opposite of chaos on his other arm. No, there's only

975
00:53:48,320 --> 00:53:52,180
tattoos order, I think, but it was just a weird symbol and I was like, oh, the

976
00:53:52,180 --> 00:53:54,980
only way that you would get those two symbols is if it's like chaos and order

977
00:53:54,980 --> 00:53:58,540
because you're fucking gay and this guy when I was sitting in the other like

978
00:53:58,540 --> 00:54:02,140
sitting in the room playing cards with my younger sibling and let's say those

979
00:54:02,140 --> 00:54:04,160
cards were not for humans. Yeah

980
00:54:05,360 --> 00:54:10,720
and this guy came in and was like, "Come hither, it's time to sing Happy Birthday."

981
00:54:10,720 --> 00:54:11,720
There is a guy.

982
00:54:11,720 --> 00:54:12,720
He said, "Come hither."

983
00:54:12,720 --> 00:54:13,720
Oh, man.

984
00:54:13,720 --> 00:54:17,440
No, and then they did harmony in Happy Birthday and like with vibrato.

985
00:54:17,440 --> 00:54:20,760
So, a guy was like, "Happy Birth..."

986
00:54:20,760 --> 00:54:22,240
Like just doing like theater singing.

987
00:54:22,240 --> 00:54:23,240
Jesus.

988
00:54:23,240 --> 00:54:25,040
People are like fucking 30 something.

989
00:54:25,040 --> 00:54:26,040
That sucks.

990
00:54:26,040 --> 00:54:27,040
Just kill yourself.

991
00:54:27,040 --> 00:54:28,040
Oh, my God.

992
00:54:28,040 --> 00:54:29,040
There was a...

993
00:54:29,040 --> 00:54:33,120
At Dom's mom's like birthday party, there was a...

994
00:54:33,120 --> 00:54:38,960
So I had to deal with the same type of guys I guess, but there's this one guy who like...

995
00:54:38,960 --> 00:54:40,280
What did he...

996
00:54:40,280 --> 00:54:41,280
Oh!

997
00:54:41,280 --> 00:54:47,320
So I was at the bar and Dom's dad and I were talking about what drinks we were going to

998
00:54:47,320 --> 00:54:48,320
get.

999
00:54:48,320 --> 00:54:51,240
That's what we were talking about.

1000
00:54:51,240 --> 00:54:53,320
And then the dude...

1001
00:54:53,320 --> 00:54:57,400
I was asking them if they had Modelo there because I just wanted a Modelo.

1002
00:54:57,400 --> 00:55:01,640
I went up to the bar because I thought they had Tecate but it was some stupid New Hampshire

1003
00:55:01,640 --> 00:55:08,520
local like IPA and then some dude he was talking to explained all of the IPAs to

1020
00:56:46,040 --> 00:56:50,880
Like oh my you look like your mom. You probably think I'm the weirdest guy of all time

1021
00:56:51,440 --> 00:56:55,600
You probably think I'm the weirdest guy of all time just taking off his clothes

1022
00:56:55,600 --> 00:57:04,200
It was probably think I'm so naked right now. You probably think I'm the most naked guy. You probably think my dick looks so strange

1023
00:57:04,200 --> 00:57:08,240
Yeah, that guy sucked I

1024
00:57:08,240 --> 00:57:14,820
Liked him. Yeah, it was actually Caleb in disguise. Yeah, it was me in the skies. Yeah

1025
00:57:16,160 --> 00:57:22,060
Transformers robots in the song dude. I rewatched transformers dark of the moon that movie fucking rocks

1026
00:57:22,060 --> 00:57:26,240
That might be one of my favorite movies. Really? It's so fucking it's crazy

1027
00:57:26,240 --> 00:57:33,040
Cuz like they just like restage like like world terrorist attacks like they just have said it's like oh, this is 9/11

1028
00:57:33,040 --> 00:57:35,640
Oh, this is Pearl Harbor. Like it's just like that's that's what it is

1029
00:57:35,640 --> 00:57:41,500
It's like it's like oh, but it's like 9/11, but the Transformers are knocking over the buildings Autobots. It's fucking crazy

1030
00:57:41,500 --> 00:57:46,240
That's like Optimus Prime. It's like we must compromise Jamal Khashoggi

1031
00:57:46,240 --> 00:57:50,820
It starts out with them fucking ending regimes in the Middle East

1032
00:57:50,820 --> 00:57:57,000
It's insane dude. I and it looks so fucking good. It came out in 2011 and it's

1033
00:57:57,000 --> 00:58:07,740
Where the Decepticons are blowing up Chicago and the Autobots are like we have to bring the fight to them and kill every last one

1034
00:58:07,740 --> 00:58:09,740
of them where they live

1035
00:58:09,740 --> 00:58:15,500
I'm like Megatron is like on his knees like begging for mercy and Optimus Prime

1036
00:58:15,500 --> 00:58:20,900
rips out his spinal cord. That's the one before Optimus Prime becomes a villain

1037
00:58:20,900 --> 00:58:25,780
right? Sentinel Prime is the villain in that if that's what you're thinking of.

1038
00:58:25,780 --> 00:58:32,500
Voiced by Leonard Nimoy. Yeah. No that movie's fucking sick it's on Amazon Prime

1039
00:58:32,500 --> 00:58:38,060
right now I recommend re-watching it. Whoa Amazon what? Oh my god. Oh my god.

1040
00:58:38,060 --> 00:58:44,680
Amazon Prime the transformer it's an Amazonian woman it's a robot with tits

1041
00:58:44,680 --> 00:58:49,860
yeah it's you yeah that's what you are to me okay and that's the one that's the

1042
00:58:49,860 --> 00:58:53,260
movie where they replaced Megan Fox - and they just have a random other girl and

1043
00:58:53,260 --> 00:58:58,660
the only way I can Fox is just like just like yeah that dumb bitch dumps me and
