00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,160
(singing)

2
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:25,800

6
00:00:43,300 --> 00:00:54,700
I realize how annoying. You guys have a beatboxer? You guys have tenors and basses? Do you have a scatter? Do you have a screamer?

7
00:00:54,700 --> 00:00:58,740
This is the most annoying episode already. You can turn it down if you don't like it.

8
00:00:58,740 --> 00:00:59,860
Better yet, turn it off.

9
00:00:59,860 --> 00:01:01,860
Shut it off. Stop listening.

10
00:01:01,860 --> 00:01:02,660
I dare you.

11
00:01:02,660 --> 00:01:04,340
I'm here to audition for the Pentatonix.

12
00:01:04,340 --> 00:01:08,100
[imitating a pig]

13
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:09,380
But do you guys have a...

14
00:01:09,380 --> 00:01:12,340
Do you guys have a position for a pig man?

15
00:01:12,340 --> 00:01:14,260
[laughing]

16
00:01:14,260 --> 00:01:17,620
Yeah, I know you guys are like a Christian acapella group or whatever.

17
00:01:17,620 --> 00:01:20,500
You guys ever think about adding like a guy that does pig squeals?

18
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:22,100
Yeah, like a pig-human hybrid character.

19
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:23,140
You're kind of like a pig man.

20
00:01:23,140 --> 00:01:28,020
You guys heard about like these scientists that are developing pig-human hybrids for the coming war?

21
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:32,460
you guys are into that stuff you're Christian right yeah I think and also

22
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:42,460
maybe a Peter Griffin yeah anyway turn on hey soul sister here we go you know what

23
00:01:42,460 --> 00:01:46,580

24
00:01:46,580 --> 00:01:59,420
the pigs. Do you guys need a farter and moaner? I did start to as a bit I did

25
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:06,020
start like anytime I farted I'd go like oh like it hurt me and now I like I've

26
00:02:06,020 --> 00:02:09,540
noticed times where I've involuntarily like I've seen you done that I thought

27
00:02:09,540 --> 00:02:15,000
you had maybe a stingy butt. No no it's just like it's like a Pavlov. You know

28
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,280
- You know how buttholes have like a--

29
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:17,120
- Responds to my farts.

30
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:18,000
- You know how buttholes are wrinkled

31
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,800
so that they can get bigger and let a poop or a big air out?

32
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,760
I thought maybe you were born with no wrinkles.

33
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:23,600
Maybe you have a young butt.

34
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:26,200
- It's not a Pavlov thing 'cause it's just a hobby.

35
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:27,480
(laughing)

36
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:28,800
It's just something that you do.

37
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:31,520
It's not, you didn't get trained.

38
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:32,560
- Yeah, I love watching TV.

39
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:33,680
It's so Pavlovian.

40
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:38,640
Every night I watch TV, I feel like I'm Pavlov's,

41
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:40,440
what was it, Pavlov's pet.

42
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:42,000
- Pavlov's dong.

43
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,240

44
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:44,080

55
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:30,240
you are they religious yeah Panasonic is a satanic name yeah it does sound like

56
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:35,080
pentagram. Maybe I'm thinking of some you've been thinking like news boys or

57
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:38,600
something news boys is on another level yeah news boys is like they want to that

58
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:41,880
Christian acapella for sure. Got a big big house where we can play football. All

59
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:45,600
acapella is Christian acapella. That's true yeah if you're acapella even if

60
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:50,280
you're like like one of these weird fucking like like yeah reddit acapella

61
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:54,560
guys and you're like an atheist or whatever you're doing acapella guys yeah

62
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:58,000
like there you know there's like the nerdy guys we went to school with

63
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:02,360
absolutely their reddit acapella guys I know exactly what it means okay but yeah

64
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:06,200
no acapella is is definitely Christian because we went to a college that was

65
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:12,680
full of like reddit guys who are like atheists. The devil wants you to use your fingers to make music.

66
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:16,760
True, yeah. Yeah, the bass, that's a devil's instrument. No god-loving man would--

67
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:21,080
You're fingering something. Yeah, exactly. And they don't like that. No straight adult man

68
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:22,920
should be moving his fingers in that way. I think actually Christians are allowed to finger.

69
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:29,400
Are they? I know Mormons do soaking. Oh yeah. You just can't move your penis? You have to be still?

It does sound like a fun game

74
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:54,720
Yeah, just fall asleep like being in the sauna exactly. Yeah, it's like taking a bath for one part of your body

75
00:04:54,720 --> 00:05:01,240
You put it in just it's like it's like it's like taking a bath in slime. Yeah for your for your

76
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:04,440

I spent too much time soaking

78
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:15,360
Fuck my penis is all small and pruney like a raisin now

79
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:19,600

Yeah, do you remember fucking?

82
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:38,240
Remember the web redemption that song got no point no no did not need a web redemption. I'll say that

83
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:40,760
He would give web redemptions as people

84
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:47,800
That were not did not worthy of a redemption. We're giving Kyle Mooney a web redemption. Yeah, exactly yeah for being so weird

85
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:49,880
Yeah, the stuff like that

86
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:52,240
I'm gonna give one to YouTube

87
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:57,600
Yeah, it's a good idea YouTube you need to redeem yourself right now Jake Paul in the suicide forest that shit was crazy

88
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:59,920
That shit was cool

89
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:05,160
Fuckin what was that bit we were doing earlier the lady was like you were in the burrito place

90
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:10,540
But there was like a woman at the juice place very mad at the cashiers somebody messed up her salad

91
00:06:10,540 --> 00:06:12,540
I have to imagine they made it out of meat. Yeah

92
00:06:12,540 --> 00:06:16,440
Bra me

93
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:19,040
Yeah, I

94
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:20,160
I heard what she was saying.

95
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:21,600
She was saying something about like,

96
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:22,440
I guess they were telling her

97
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:24,400
that she has to wait outside or something like that.

98
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:26,240
- She was a lady who was speaking Spanish

99
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:30,400
and she did say cabrone, which I believe means bastard.

100
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:31,480
- But then she switched to English

101
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:35,240
and she said like, it's so fucking manipulative what you do.

102
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:37,280
- That's the ultimate disrespect.

103
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:38,120
Switching to English.

104
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:38,960
- I hate when this is a crazy juice place.

105
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:40,320
- This is manipulative.

106
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:41,760
- Yeah, but we were like sitting,

107
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:44,000
like as she was screaming, we were like.

108
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,680
- Yeah, we're two Peter Griffins, we're here to cheer you up.

109
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:48,760
- Excuse me ma'am, we're here to cheer you up.

110
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:52,360
We saw you were in some sort of distress with two Peter Griffin impersonators.

00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:53,560
Yeah, we're gonna make you our Loish.

112
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:55,560
We're basically gonna turn you into our Loish.

113
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:57,060
Uh, I think you're gonna find it.

114
00:06:57,060 --> 00:06:59,360
It's gonna be the most beautiful thing you've ever been a part of.

115
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:00,560
It's gonna be brilliant.

116
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:02,760
And I- can I have a bite of that salad?

00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:16,760
Two- two Peter Griffins at the same damn time.

124
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:17,760
Ooh-wee!

We should. Yeah. We should take the... Oh fuck. You should come... because you're in Boston.

134
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:58,200
You should meet us halfway in Rhode Island and we take the family guy tour.

135
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:02,280
I'm down. That Caleb told me about. I did just tell him about that. 30 minutes ago.

136
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:05,240
We're doing all that family guy crap and I was like, did you know that we could

137
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:10,200
we could do this on in a place where people appreciate it? Rhode Island on a tour. Rhode

138
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:15,480
Island is not... Hey uh... You don't go through Rhode Island to get the... Massachusetts right?

139
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:20,440
if you're coming from New York. I don't know. You can. Yeah, I think it's out of the way.

140
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:27,720
If you have a quohog state of mind, and you need it fixed. Did they do that? Because if they didn't,

141
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:34,120
that was a big missed opportunity. I got a quohog state of mind. Peter Griffin jungle,

142
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:42,280
something, something. The Peter Griffin jungle. I would not want to get stranded in there.

143
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:44,600
Brian is my dog.

144
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:47,400
Stoey is my son too.

145
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:49,840
Now you're in quo.

146
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:51,640
God damn it.

147
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:55,640
You know that song is actually, that's just YouTube like 2008 level.

148
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:59,240
So what, what have we fucking devolved into?

149
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:01,360
You guys know that that's stupider every episode.

150
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:03,440
Do you guys know that that song is actually about LA?

151
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:04,360
Not many people know that.

152
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:05,320
That true.

153
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:05,640
Yeah.

154
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:06,520
Yeah.

155
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:10,600
Cause the song is about, um, it's about the Hollywood empire.

156
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:11,040
Yeah.

157
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:11,760
Wow.

158
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:14,040

159
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:14,880
- Wow. - Which,

160
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:16,280
don't you fucking dare.

161
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:17,120
- That's what it's called.

162
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:18,440
- Don't you fucking dare.

163
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:19,920
- That's what you say McDonald's is evil.

164
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:22,920
- That's what Rage Against the Machine called it.

165
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:23,940
- Oh my God.

166
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:26,440
- I'm gonna have to have a talking to with Tom Morello.

167
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:27,280
- Yeah. - Yeah.

168
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:29,240
- I don't think he is fancy for that matter.

169
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:32,580
(imitating Tom Morello)

170
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:38,520
- Tom, we all gathered here today because we love you

171
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:39,920
and we wanna be honest with you.

172
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:42,840
(imitating guitar)

173
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:44,260
- You win it now!

174
00:09:44,260 --> 00:09:45,100
(laughing)

175
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:46,840
(imitating guitar)

176
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:48,140
- And that's the problem, Tom.

177
00:09:48,140 --> 00:09:48,980
- Yeah.

178
00:09:48,980 --> 00:09:50,400
- You keep doing (imitating guitar)

179
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:51,720
when we're trying to talk to you.

180
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:54,960
- I mean, that is one of the sickest things ever,

181
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:57,040
is turning his guitar into a turntable.

182
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:58,200
- Yeah. - So cool.

183
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:00,520
- With the fucking, he has a button

184
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:02,980
that he installed on his guitar, it's like a kill switch,

185
00:10:02,980 --> 00:10:06,020
so any time that he presses it, it stops sound,

186
00:10:06,020 --> 00:10:08,200
but he also has a wah pedal, and he's like--

187
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:09,360
- An excuse me, what pedal?

188
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:15,220
wah pedal so it makes the guitar go wah. That's what makes it goes wah wah wah

189
00:10:15,220 --> 00:10:18,540
but then he hits the button at the same time like the switch. I like how creative

190
00:10:18,540 --> 00:10:23,060
guitarists are that they named it a wah pedal. Yeah. What does this do? I guess it wahs.

191
00:10:23,060 --> 00:10:27,740
It's called the crybaby. It's called the crybaby from Dunlop. It's like a wah wee wah wah pedal.

192
00:10:27,740 --> 00:10:32,840
There's also a guitar pedal, it's like a distortion pedal called the metal zone

193
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:38,400
which is like a really cool name. That's not a cool name. Yeah I know it's not a

194
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:43,920
a cool it's just you know what I think is cool and that is very stupid. No. HM2. HM2? That's

195
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:50,120
a cool name. Is it HM1 or HM2? That's a cool name. It's a Pokemon. Isn't HM1 or 2 aren't

196
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:54,880
they? Isn't that the heavy metal? The Entombed one. Oh. I don't know I'm just making a joke.

197
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:58,800
It's a dumb name. It's just letters and numbers. I don't know. Didn't yeah Full of Hell has

198
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:04,880
a guitar pedal too. You know what would be sick? If we get enough money is like I just

199
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:08,420
by a bunch of I get a different microphone and I just hook myself up to

200
00:11:08,420 --> 00:11:12,380
all the guitar pedals. Dude if we all got fucking huge pedal boards. Oh my god for our voices.

201
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:15,700
Distinct yeah. We each have completely different pedals.

202
00:11:15,700 --> 00:11:19,500
Full sound board. This is not for Caleb this is just for me and Cameron.

203
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:23,860
I will have five Peter Griffin pedals. There's no Peter Griffin pedal. Oh yeah.

204
00:11:23,860 --> 00:11:31,060
Whoa what was that switch you just did? Hey I'm using a Peter Griffin pedal right now.

205
00:11:31,060 --> 00:11:36,420
Wow. And now it's off. But now it's on. And now it's off.

206
00:11:36,420 --> 00:11:40,420
I'm inventing my own pitch shifter that only goes up. You can't ever turn it back down.

207
00:11:40,420 --> 00:11:44,620
So once you turn the knob up one notch, you can't turn it back the other way.

208
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:46,620
So you can only use it ten times.

209
00:11:46,620 --> 00:11:47,620
Whoa. I have these.

210
00:11:47,620 --> 00:11:50,460
So you have to buy a new one every time you want to get low pitch again.

211
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:53,460
That's sick. I have a bass pedal. It's like a multi-effect pedal. And then I have these

212
00:11:53,460 --> 00:12:02,700
two like Dan Electro Fab, Dan Electro Fab Distortion, Dan Electro, like they're like the $20 plastic

213
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:03,700
pedals.

214
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:04,700
Who the hell is Dan Electro?

215
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:07,300
It's made by Daniel Electro.

216
00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:11,540
The guitars that like, I think Phoebe Bridgers uses one.

217
00:12:11,540 --> 00:12:14,300
She smashed a Dano, she smashed a Dano Baritone U2.

218
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:16,620
That was so disrespectful when she did that.

219
00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:17,620
Disrespectful to music.

220
00:12:17,620 --> 00:12:19,580
It was disrespectful to music, to SNL.

221
00:12:19,580 --> 00:12:21,100
And to Dan Electro guitars.

222
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:23,060
And to just to men in general.

223
00:12:23,060 --> 00:12:25,900
So four people, four important institutions.

224
00:12:25,900 --> 00:12:30,060
We should bring back witch trials for people like that.

225
00:12:30,060 --> 00:12:32,540
Women who think they can do rock.

226
00:12:32,540 --> 00:12:34,860
I mean when Pete Townshend does it, that's different.

227
00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:35,860
He's a famous pedophile.

228
00:12:35,860 --> 00:12:36,860
Exactly.

229
00:12:36,860 --> 00:12:40,980
He's trying to destroy the hard drive on his guitar.

230
00:12:40,980 --> 00:12:44,020
He's swinging his computer around on stage and he's like, "Why'd you smash that hard

231
00:12:44,020 --> 00:12:45,020
drive on stage?"

232
00:12:45,020 --> 00:12:47,100
It's got my credit card information in it.

233
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:50,140
I have to smash it.

234
00:12:50,140 --> 00:12:52,380
(laughing)

235
00:12:52,380 --> 00:12:55,320
- It was a virus in my computer, I swear!

236
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:57,740
- I wish that we could do cool rock shit like that on stage.

237
00:12:57,740 --> 00:13:01,460
- Oh man, dude, you get me a Les Paul at the live show,

238
00:13:01,460 --> 00:13:03,220
I'll smash that shit on stage.

239
00:13:03,220 --> 00:13:04,060
- Why?

240
00:13:04,060 --> 00:13:06,360
- That's an open invitation to all the fans.

241
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:08,860
If you wanna bring me a guitar to smash at the show.

242
00:13:08,860 --> 00:13:11,020
- If you guys bring me something I don't like,

243
00:13:11,020 --> 00:13:11,860
I'll smash it.

244
00:13:11,860 --> 00:13:13,060
- Uh-huh, I'll smash it on stage.

245
00:13:13,060 --> 00:13:17,220
If you bring me a big mallet and a watermelon at this show.

246
00:13:17,220 --> 00:13:19,020
(laughing)

247
00:13:19,020 --> 00:13:23,180
You bet your ass I'm gonna smash it.

248
00:13:23,180 --> 00:13:25,100
If you bring me a McChicken I'm gonna eat it.

249
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:26,100
I'm gonna smash that.

250
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:27,700
I'm gonna smash that shit in my belly.

251
00:13:27,700 --> 00:13:29,260
You will not smash it before I eat it.

252
00:13:29,260 --> 00:13:30,260
I'm gonna smash it though.

253
00:13:30,260 --> 00:13:31,260
No.

254
00:13:31,260 --> 00:13:32,260
I'll smash you.

255
00:13:32,260 --> 00:13:33,860
I'm gonna fuck the McChicken before you eat it.

256
00:13:33,860 --> 00:13:34,860
I'm gonna smash it though.

257
00:13:34,860 --> 00:13:36,420
You guys aren't getting anywhere near it.

258
00:13:36,420 --> 00:13:37,420
Yeah.

259
00:13:37,420 --> 00:13:42,420
You guys wanna have like 20 McChickens up on stage with us so we can just eat them if

260
00:13:42,420 --> 00:13:43,420
we get hungry?

261
00:13:43,420 --> 00:13:48,420
At the show we should just start fucking fingering each other and go to jail.

262
00:13:48,420 --> 00:13:51,020
(laughing)

263
00:13:51,020 --> 00:13:52,460
- We just immediately go up.

264
00:13:52,460 --> 00:13:54,820
Podcast about, oh my god.

265
00:13:54,820 --> 00:13:56,380
- Oh.

266
00:13:56,380 --> 00:13:57,820
What are they doing?

267
00:13:57,820 --> 00:13:59,060
- So everyone leaves and then we have to go

268
00:13:59,060 --> 00:14:00,260
to prison for a night.

269
00:14:00,260 --> 00:14:01,580
I don't think you would go to prison for more.

270
00:14:01,580 --> 00:14:03,260
- You can't go to prison for one night.

271
00:14:03,260 --> 00:14:05,060
- You can't go to prison for fingering your friend.

272
00:14:05,060 --> 00:14:05,900
- Really?

273
00:14:05,900 --> 00:14:06,720
- You can go to jail for a night.

274
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:08,300
- You can go to jail for a night, but prison, you're--

275
00:14:08,300 --> 00:14:10,220
- Do I look like some fucking drug addict

276
00:14:10,220 --> 00:14:11,700
who knows what the inside of prison looks like?

277
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:13,900
- You do have the prison dot on your thumb.

278
00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:17,700
- This means that I love my dot.

279
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:23,100
You love your dot. I love my dot on my thumb. That's not a... I've never been to

280
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:27,620
jail. You've been to jail. Did you think I've been to jail? You told me last night that that dot in

281
00:14:27,620 --> 00:14:32,780
Texas jails, in Texas prisons, that means you're a bottom and you like to get

282
00:14:32,780 --> 00:14:38,860
fucked. Did you think I knew that when I got it put on my body? No. No! I didn't

283
00:14:38,860 --> 00:14:41,660
think you knew that but you told me that's what it meant. Yeah I found that

284
00:14:41,660 --> 00:14:45,980
out because I went into a pool hall in Texas and a guy called me a naughty word.

285
00:14:45,980 --> 00:14:49,860
heard. And I just had to kind of stand there and be like, okay.

286
00:14:49,860 --> 00:14:51,860
Did he explain it to you?

287
00:14:51,860 --> 00:14:53,860
No, I looked it up later.

288
00:14:53,860 --> 00:14:55,860
Oh, okay.

289
00:14:55,860 --> 00:14:57,860
Yeah, and I was like, oh, yeah, I totally am one dude.

290
00:14:57,860 --> 00:15:01,860
No, you don't understand, dude. This dot means that I want a freckle there.

291
00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:03,860
I'm saving up for a freckle.

292
00:15:03,860 --> 00:15:05,860
You don't understand.

293
00:15:05,860 --> 00:15:09,860
I've been going to so many tanning booths. It's not working.

294
00:15:09,860 --> 00:15:13,860
This dot is so that I can go in a tanning booth, it will tan every other part of my hand

295
00:15:13,860 --> 00:15:16,500
and then I can remove the dot and it will be lighter.

296
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:17,340
- Exactly, yeah.

297
00:15:17,340 --> 00:15:19,540
- Yeah, I have a reverse freckle, yeah.

298
00:15:19,540 --> 00:15:22,540
- Yeah, but that was not a great realization to have.

299
00:15:22,540 --> 00:15:23,380
- Yeah?

300
00:15:23,380 --> 00:15:24,300
- Yeah, I was at a pool.

301
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:25,700
- Who gave you that tattoo?

302
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:28,020
'Cause I remember you said you woke up and you had it.

303
00:15:28,020 --> 00:15:29,640
- My brother gave it to me.

304
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:31,220
- So your brother knew?

305
00:15:31,220 --> 00:15:32,060
- Oh yeah.

306
00:15:32,060 --> 00:15:33,060
- Your brother knew that?

307
00:15:33,060 --> 00:15:33,880
- He had to have known.

308
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:36,100
- Yeah, you gotta turn that into like a,

309
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:38,620
yeah, I can fix that up for you.

310
00:15:38,620 --> 00:15:40,100
- What are you gonna turn it into?

311
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:40,940
- A line?

312
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:42,020
- I can fix it up.

313
00:15:42,020 --> 00:15:43,500
- Don't worry, don't worry buddy,

314
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:46,700
I can fix that. I'm gonna turn that I'm gonna turn that dot into an O and the

315
00:15:46,700 --> 00:15:53,900
word bottom. I am a fucktion. My asshole open. That's the period at the end of the sentence.

316
00:15:53,900 --> 00:15:59,940
Yeah I'm just gonna turn it into open. I love to fuck guys. Please don't do that dude.

317
00:15:59,940 --> 00:16:04,020
Something like that. If I do go to prison people these guys might these guys these

318
00:16:04,020 --> 00:16:07,900
prisoner guys you know I don't know if I'm breaking news here not the smartest

319
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:13,240
bunch they might get the wrong idea. It's a hard stance to take. Prisoners?

320
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:18,820
Prisoners are smart. How? They're so smart you know who are smart? The ones who

321
00:16:18,820 --> 00:16:23,140
figure out how to turn like toothpicks into iPhones and start doing IG lives.

322
00:16:23,140 --> 00:16:28,100
Exactly, yeah. People who do like they build a computer out of dominoes. You're allowed to have a phone in jail? No.

323
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:33,600
No no no. You're not? No you have to, no you you get one you get one. Oh you can

324
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:38,680
save up to buy a phone. You get a heel of bread, you get a heel of bread and you get a little

325
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:42,880
thing of gruel. Prison is basically like a- You have to wear a tunic. It's basically oblivion.

326
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:47,040
Yep. Yeah. They're giant, they have the rats from the Princess Bride. You have to save

327
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:51,000
up cigarettes but if you get too many you become over encumbered. Exactly. Yeah. And

328
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:58,000
you can't move. It is crazy just how, I mean, obviously I don't know that much about prison.

armpit size XL large blood stain on the penis vintage from twenty nineteen.

347
00:18:23,660 --> 00:18:24,860
That's the fucking worst.

348
00:18:24,860 --> 00:18:29,140
When somebody like, you can tell on one of those vintage resellers,

349
00:18:29,140 --> 00:18:31,900
you can tell they just took the fucking Gildan tag off.

350
00:18:31,900 --> 00:18:32,260
Yeah.

351
00:18:32,260 --> 00:18:34,780
And they were like, oh, this is from '93.

352
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:38,980
It says like, "Ugly Guy Shirt for the Grossest Guy Ever."

353
00:18:38,980 --> 00:18:42,500
And it's just like, it's like an XL shirt that's from one year ago.

354
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:43,300
Yeah.

355
00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:44,940
An Etnies shirt.

356
00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:45,820
Vintage.

357
00:18:45,820 --> 00:18:46,420
Yeah.

358
00:18:46,420 --> 00:18:50,820
If you're putting something up online and you're calling it from 2002

359
00:18:50,820 --> 00:18:53,700
and you're calling it vintage, fuck you.

360
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:55,940
- What if you're a baby?

361
00:18:55,940 --> 00:18:56,780
- It's true.

362
00:18:56,780 --> 00:18:58,460
- Come on, man, you gotta think about this shit.

363
00:18:58,460 --> 00:19:00,620
- Well, maybe it's 'cause I was alive in 2002,

364
00:19:00,620 --> 00:19:03,460
but I don't think that's vintage.

365
00:19:03,460 --> 00:19:05,860
- Yeah, I don't think it matters.

366
00:19:05,860 --> 00:19:08,340
- Well, I think there's a distinction

367
00:19:08,340 --> 00:19:12,580
between online sellers is like Y2K now.

368
00:19:12,580 --> 00:19:14,420
They'll put Y2K in something,

369
00:19:14,420 --> 00:19:17,220
and then vintage is anything before Y2K.

370
00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:19,740
- I mean, if I see Y2K in a listing,

371
00:19:19,740 --> 00:19:21,740
I'm not buying it because that scares me.

372
00:19:21,740 --> 00:19:22,740
No way.

373
00:19:22,740 --> 00:19:24,180
No way.

374
00:19:24,180 --> 00:19:26,620
I wish I had been smart enough to defeat that.

375
00:19:26,620 --> 00:19:27,620
Yeah.

376
00:19:27,620 --> 00:19:28,620
Y2K?

377
00:19:28,620 --> 00:19:29,620
Yeah.

378
00:19:29,620 --> 00:19:30,620
I was actually, I did.

379
00:19:30,620 --> 00:19:31,620

God damn it.

388
00:19:39,620 --> 00:19:41,620
So what if you went to Pentatonix and you played instrument?

389
00:19:41,620 --> 00:19:42,620
Yeah.

390
00:19:42,620 --> 00:19:48,460
I mean, they have to have considered it.

398
00:20:20,340 --> 00:20:24,900

399
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:29,460
Who's in Infomaniac? Lars Von Trier is so cool because he's just like, he just makes

400
00:20:29,460 --> 00:20:35,580
a movie, just like blah, blah, blah. It's like walking through a Halloween store. Yeah, yeah.

401
00:20:35,580 --> 00:20:40,740
It's all these fucking weird shit, weird fake shit jumping out at you. It's like the Halloween

402
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:44,340
store type shit where like it's not like a werewolf mask. It's like you walk in

403
00:20:44,340 --> 00:20:49,940

404
00:20:49,940 --> 00:20:54,260
it's like come on no I'm not gonna wear that. Lars von Trier was in an

405
00:20:54,260 --> 00:20:57,860
interview and he was just trying to be like funny and he was like I absolutely

406
00:20:57,860 --> 00:21:04,100
love Hitler. Yeah, Hitler is my favorite man of all time. And then when everybody was like

407
00:21:04,100 --> 00:21:08,860
hey man why'd you say you love Hitler? He was like I was joking. I was being funny.

408
00:21:08,860 --> 00:21:13,760
I thought you would all understand that I was being funny and then he fucking accent is

409
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:21,300
Like Belgian or so no that was a perfect Lars. Oh, thank you. No problem, buddy. Thank you

410
00:21:21,300 --> 00:21:26,100
I hope one day to become one of those psycho directors. Yeah. Yeah like hammer the

411
00:21:26,100 --> 00:21:29,100
Anna Barbera

412
00:21:29,100 --> 00:21:32,020
That fucking psycho that

413
00:21:32,020 --> 00:21:37,140
Crazy monster on the set Tim story. Yeah. Mm-hmm

414
00:21:37,140 --> 00:21:41,260
I mean, Anna Barbera, she was one of the craziest directors.

415
00:21:41,260 --> 00:21:43,580
She was one of the craziest bitches of all time.

416
00:21:43,580 --> 00:21:45,580
Did you see what she did to her?

417
00:21:45,580 --> 00:21:50,580
Like, her, like, you think what Stanley Kubrick did to Shelley Duvall was bad.

418
00:21:50,580 --> 00:21:52,380
She threw a fucking piano at Tom.

419
00:21:52,380 --> 00:21:53,380
Yeah, dude.

420
00:21:53,380 --> 00:21:56,180
Imagine, yeah, what if they had shown up to do a...

421
00:21:56,180 --> 00:22:00,700
I mean, she's making all those guys race, and yeah, it's a wacky race, but Jesus fucking

422
00:22:00,700 --> 00:22:01,700
Christ.

423
00:22:01,700 --> 00:22:02,980
Some of them could have gotten hurt.

424
00:22:02,980 --> 00:22:05,700
When you walked on set and you saw a pile of anvils on the corner, you knew it was going

425
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:06,700
to be a long day.

426
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:12,840
Yeah, I know one of those is gonna fly me out. Hong Kong Phu we had just a nervous breakdown too.

427
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:16,600
Yeah, you hear about that? He just wasn't in anything after the show. It's true.

428
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:20,540
I mean, I think he might have been in Wacky Racers, but everybody was in that.

429
00:22:20,540 --> 00:22:26,400
Yeah, yeah, you know and then she had the gall to do it to a bunch of babies. Yeah, bunch of baby versions.

430
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:31,840
Sucks. Yeah, I mean drop an anvil on me all you want. Leave my damn kids out of this, bitch.

431
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:34,260
Leave the baby version of me alone.

432
00:22:34,260 --> 00:22:38,940
- I don't, use my damn baby version alternate reality me.

433
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:40,100
Out of this you bitch.

434
00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:43,060
- You wanna turn baby me into a fucking,

435
00:22:43,060 --> 00:22:45,060
you want me to walk around my baby,

436
00:22:45,060 --> 00:22:48,020
my baby version of me to walk around like an accordion?

437
00:22:48,020 --> 00:22:49,860
- Get blown back up eyes first.

438
00:22:49,860 --> 00:22:52,300
- Listen, you fuck with me, I don't care.

439
00:22:52,300 --> 00:22:54,460
You fuck with my family, I don't care either.

440
00:22:54,460 --> 00:22:56,580
But you go back in time and you make a prequel

441
00:22:56,580 --> 00:22:57,940
where you fuck with my family.

442
00:22:57,940 --> 00:22:59,180
- In 3D?

443
00:22:59,180 --> 00:23:00,740
Oh hell no.

444
00:23:00,740 --> 00:23:02,080
It's going down Hannah.

445
00:23:03,580 --> 00:23:07,420
But you know, honestly, a trailblazer for female directors everywhere, Hanna-Barbera.

446
00:23:07,420 --> 00:23:08,420
Absolutely.

447
00:23:08,420 --> 00:23:09,420
And we stan.

448
00:23:09,420 --> 00:23:14,340
She really brought a very female version of evil to directing.

449
00:23:14,340 --> 00:23:17,780
She was one of the most evil women of all time.

450
00:23:17,780 --> 00:23:19,260
All time, and you have to respect it.

451
00:23:19,260 --> 00:23:20,500
She's up there with the Iron Lady.

452
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:21,500
Mm-hmm.

453
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:22,500
Yeah.

454
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:23,500
Yeah.

455
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:24,500
I don't know who that is.

456
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:25,660
I guess he's a super villain.

457
00:23:25,660 --> 00:23:26,900
The Iron Lady, you know.

458
00:23:26,900 --> 00:23:29,620
Did she fight Spider-Man, the Iron Lady?

459
00:23:29,620 --> 00:23:31,020
She was like really heavy, right?

460
00:23:31,020 --> 00:23:32,020
That was her power?

461
00:23:32,020 --> 00:23:33,460
Am I remembering this right?

462
00:23:33,460 --> 00:23:35,460
Something about that?

463
00:23:35,460 --> 00:23:39,500
Trying to think of like a funny person who would be the Iron Lady, but I couldn't think of anything.

464
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:44,620
You. Mother Teresa, how about that? That's the most obvious fucking... No.

465
00:23:44,620 --> 00:23:48,960
She's a she's a gold standard of a damn lady. Yeah. Yeah, dude.

466
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:54,860
She was beautiful. Made out of grit. Remember when she stood in on top of the subway grate and the the the vent blew her dress up?

467
00:23:54,860 --> 00:23:58,580
Mother Teresa? Yeah. Everyone saw her damn snatch. Yeah!

00:23:58,580 --> 00:24:00,820
(laughter)

469
00:24:00,820 --> 00:24:09,060
- Remember what Justin Timberlake did to her

00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:12,980

00:26:10,220 --> 00:26:14,780
Well at least wait until we're done hanging out. It didn't already give you a ruling

00:26:15,540 --> 00:26:21,540
Yeah, but I think she was just trying my dad even said it like I went in at when they were closing

496
00:26:21,540 --> 00:26:27,460
And I think she was just trying to push me out doctors are notoriously evil. Yeah, yeah

497
00:26:27,460 --> 00:26:29,880
And they'll do anything just to get out of working

498
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:36,380
Absolutely hate doctors dude stop trying to break shit in my house. Yeah, and it's like it's like what's it?

499
00:26:36,380 --> 00:26:39,360

00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:44,420
Like what's up with that stethoscope?

00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:50,580
Nice, why are you wearing that? Why are you listening to music while I'm here trying to get my fucking balls checked up on?

You're trying to listen to music my heart steal it so you can get a record deal? Stop being a doctor?

504
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:58,040
I can hear little Wayne Miss Officer coming out of your damn stethoscope.

00:26:58,040 --> 00:26:59,380
Yeah, all I hear is "Wee, wee, wee!"

when Patrick, so I'm staying at Patrick's apartment whenever he

528
00:28:59,100 --> 00:29:02,960
goes into his room and closes the door within ten seconds and

529
00:29:02,980 --> 00:29:04,520
lasting twenty minutes. There's just the

530
00:29:04,520 --> 00:29:06,560
noise of stuff falling onto the floor

531
00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:08,580
that he goes into his room. It's just

532
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:11,500
clang boom, bow, just this shit flying

533
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:14,020
around in with one big explosion.

534
00:29:14,020 --> 00:29:16,120
They've slowly fades away. It's

535
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:17,340
happened. It happened when you went to

536
00:29:17,340 --> 00:29:18,880
bed last night and when you woke up

537
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:21,180
this morning, it's because no, it's I

538
00:29:21,180 --> 00:29:22,640
mean it's because one I have the knee

539
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:24,540
injury. It's a reset the Rube Goldberg

540
00:29:24,540 --> 00:29:27,140
device. It wakes him up. I have I mean

541
00:29:27,140 --> 00:29:30,220
it's a knee injury and like I think

542
00:29:30,220 --> 00:29:32,780
that's my belt buckle. I think like I

543
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:35,800
I take my pants off and I throw them on the floor.

544
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:37,800
I forget that you're a WWE world champion.

545
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:39,800
Yeah, I wear the biggest belt buckle.

546
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:41,800
Yeah, you wear the biggest belt buckle in the world.

547
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:51,800
But, that plus I'm a fucking idiot and I like will turn my flashlight on my phone and then throw it on my bed and then like go shut the light off.

548
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:57,800
But then half the time, like I'll have the light off and then the flashlight will be like on the bed.

549
00:29:57,800 --> 00:29:59,800
So I can't see shit.

550
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:02,520
shit. So I like walk. I'm in my room

551
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:05,440
fucking tiny, too, but so what

552
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:07,120
happened last night? Oh yeah. Last

553
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:08,440
night we were trying to set up the

554
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:10,160
air mattress and first we got it

555
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:11,760
like we're like oh yeah. Neil's room

556
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:14,320
is like the biggest room. So we'll

557
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:18,680
put we'll put the air mattress in

558
00:30:18,680 --> 00:30:22,680
in like Neil's room and we blew up

559
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:24,560
the air mattress. Neil went into his

560
00:30:24,560 --> 00:30:26,360
room and blew up. So his bed is like

561
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:27,360
like against the wall and there's

562
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:29,280
like space and then the door. He like

563
00:30:29,320 --> 00:30:30,280
put the air mattress down in the

564
00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:31,320
space between the bed and the door

565
00:30:31,320 --> 00:30:33,280
and blew it up. It was the exact

566
00:30:33,280 --> 00:30:35,280
size and shape of all the space in

567
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:36,880
his room that wasn't the bed and the

568
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:39,280
door and he was like so he was like

569
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:41,580
stuck behind it and he couldn't get

570
00:30:41,580 --> 00:30:45,380
out and then it's like if his show

571
00:30:45,380 --> 00:30:47,380
wasn't there if his show wasn't there,

572
00:30:47,380 --> 00:30:48,580
he would have been able to get out

573
00:30:48,580 --> 00:30:50,080
the wall that was like blocking the

574
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:51,580
only way he get out yeah and like so

575
00:30:51,580 --> 00:30:53,780
we started to move it and as soon as

576
00:30:53,780 --> 00:30:55,980
the air mattress touched the shelf,

577
00:30:55,980 --> 00:30:58,280
it just collapsed and all of his

578
00:30:58,320 --> 00:31:03,280
books. And he just go, Oh, no,

579
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:10,280
it was so fucking stupid. And he kept trying to be like, no,

580
00:31:10,280 --> 00:31:13,000
it's going to work. No. If I was like, Neil, what if you need to get up?

581
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:16,000
And he's like, Oh, I'll just climb over you. Right. It's just like,

582
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,280
like Neil, I think Neil and Alice,

583
00:31:18,280 --> 00:31:20,960
you Neil and Alice are the only people who drank last night.

584
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:24,040
So it was just Neil. Neil was kind of drunk. Just like,

585
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:30,000
inflating an entire air mattress that filled the whole space.

586
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:34,240
It was so like, and I remember like literally the exact shape inside.

587
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:37,280
It was almost blown up all the way. I was like,

588
00:31:37,280 --> 00:31:40,640
he's not gonna be able to get out.

589
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:45,120
Dude, you guys should get a bouncy castle. Yeah, we had to put the air mattress, oh

590
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:48,480
did we deflate that when we left? No, who cares. No, he's still stuck. He's

591
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:52,080
starving to death in his room. Guys, I need to get out!

592
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:56,240
Yeah, the list. Most smelly animal. If we have done this,

593
00:31:56,240 --> 00:32:02,760
Okay, then you find another list right this second. Okay. Let's look at the other ones. There's one that's far as beautiful animal poops on this farts

594
00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:07,360
Top 10 things you wish smarts fells farts. Excuse me

595
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:10,780
Top 10 things you wish farts smelled like

596
00:32:10,780 --> 00:32:13,720
by Queen Iris ice queen

597
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:18,940
What Queen Iris ice number one you fucking pick a thing?

00:32:18,940 --> 00:32:21,800
You're the queen of everyone fresh baked cookies. Tell you what, I

599
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:26,160
I got some pretty terrible smelling farts. I still love huffing those things though.

600
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:27,520
Absolutely. That's what it's for.

601
00:32:27,520 --> 00:32:27,840
Yeah.

602
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:30,000
Smelling your own farts?

603
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,760
That's what... Who else is going to do it?

604
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:32,800
Dude, I'm...

605
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:33,280
Your dog.

606
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:36,160
Trying to clear the area, dude. I'll...

607
00:32:36,160 --> 00:32:38,240
I hate the smell of my own farts.

608
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:39,280
Dude, I'm doing fucking...

609
00:32:39,280 --> 00:32:45,520
I hate when a fart smells, but there's a very distinct kind of fart smell.

610
00:32:45,520 --> 00:32:51,280
Like it's not... It's the type that like lingers, you know?

611
00:32:51,280 --> 00:32:58,120
Yeah, the thing about fart smells is that like complete sorry. It's just not completely unpleasant, but it's also not pleasant

612
00:32:58,120 --> 00:33:00,280
But it stays for a long well. Yeah fart smells

613
00:33:00,280 --> 00:33:05,460
They're like it's like a bad smell, but it's not like I'm going to throw up bad smell unless someone's like very sick

614
00:33:05,460 --> 00:33:10,040
Those are very bad my ones when you get like the flu when I'm like toxic

615
00:33:10,040 --> 00:33:14,140
I'm basically trying to like mitigate casualties, so I'll just fucking throw it in my own face

616
00:33:14,140 --> 00:33:19,260
Yeah, oh yeah, I try to get on it like a grenade. Yeah, use my mouth like a filter

617
00:33:19,780 --> 00:33:26,480
This fucking puff it all up and just let out a little breath talk about eating farts too much. I'll eat them I smell them

618
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:31,980
Okay, okay. Yeah, it's yeah. It's like the filter in a fish tank if you okay if you had a tube

619
00:33:31,980 --> 00:33:39,320
Hooked up to your to your butt Preston Lacey jackass. Yeah, - yeah, you put it into like a

620
00:33:39,320 --> 00:33:47,500
It's a tube connected to a Tupperware. Mm-hmm in your in your freezer. Could you freeze a fart could I yeah?

621
00:33:47,500 --> 00:33:48,340
- Yeah, would I?

622
00:33:48,340 --> 00:33:50,220
- This is a question for all of our scientist fans.

623
00:33:50,220 --> 00:33:51,500
- Well yeah, I mean, if it,

624
00:33:51,500 --> 00:33:53,540
if you got it to a low enough temperature, right,

625
00:33:53,540 --> 00:33:54,780
it'd have to, right?

626
00:33:54,780 --> 00:33:55,820
I mean, 'cause you can,

627
00:33:55,820 --> 00:33:58,100
right?

628
00:33:58,100 --> 00:34:00,540
You can freeze, 'cause you can freeze air.

629
00:34:00,540 --> 00:34:02,820
- If you're a scientist and you listen to this.

630
00:34:02,820 --> 00:34:06,180
- Could I freeze it and then use it like cooking oil spray?

631
00:34:06,180 --> 00:34:08,100
- Yeah, if I froze it into like a snowball

632
00:34:08,100 --> 00:34:10,180
and I threw it, would it like explode into a fart cloud?

633
00:34:10,180 --> 00:34:11,500
- Would it make my mom mad?

634
00:34:11,500 --> 00:34:14,700
If I froze my fart and threw it at her,

635
00:34:14,700 --> 00:34:15,540
would it make her mad?

636
00:34:15,540 --> 00:34:17,580
It's a question for all you scientists out there.

637
00:34:17,580 --> 00:34:24,220
Yeah, all the scientists that listen to this show, Dr. Kravorkian.

638
00:34:24,220 --> 00:34:26,180
Let us know what you think about that.

639
00:34:26,180 --> 00:34:29,580
Our biggest fan, Dr. Kravorkian.

640
00:34:29,580 --> 00:34:32,660
I thought about it at one point, because I fart a lot, dude.

641
00:34:32,660 --> 00:34:33,740
It's hard for me.

642
00:34:33,740 --> 00:34:37,460
So I thought about getting one of those things that you, one of those, it's basically like

643
00:34:37,460 --> 00:34:41,580
a pad that a woman would wear, but instead of catching blood, it makes your fart smell

644
00:34:41,580 --> 00:34:42,580
like Lysol.

645
00:34:42,580 --> 00:34:44,660
Is that a real thing?

646
00:34:44,660 --> 00:34:45,500
- Yeah.

647
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:46,940
- You put it on your butt and then when you fart,

648
00:34:46,940 --> 00:34:48,500
you're like, "Damn, this is so clean."

649
00:34:48,500 --> 00:34:50,140
- See, ideas like that are a million dollars.

650
00:34:50,140 --> 00:34:51,740
- Yeah, well the problem with that is that--

651
00:34:51,740 --> 00:34:53,300
- Are a million dollars ideas.

652
00:34:53,300 --> 00:34:55,580
(laughing)

653
00:34:55,580 --> 00:34:58,140
Like that is like one of the most beautiful inventions.

654
00:34:58,140 --> 00:35:00,580
- I mean, that's so beautiful, the way you put that.

655
00:35:00,580 --> 00:35:02,380
Ideas like that are a million dollars.

656
00:35:02,380 --> 00:35:04,620
- The thing about that is that you wear it all day

657
00:35:04,620 --> 00:35:05,860
and then when you take it off

658
00:35:05,860 --> 00:35:07,420
and you throw it into the trash can,

659
00:35:07,420 --> 00:35:09,820
the impact, there's every fart that you let out

660
00:35:09,820 --> 00:35:11,980
while you were wearing it blasts out into the room.

661
00:35:11,980 --> 00:35:13,340
- I had an idea like that.

662
00:35:13,340 --> 00:35:14,180
- What was it?

663
00:35:14,180 --> 00:35:15,180
Okay.

664
00:35:15,180 --> 00:35:18,060
Wearing that would probably grow like mold on your body.

665
00:35:18,060 --> 00:35:19,060
Yeah.

666
00:35:19,060 --> 00:35:20,060
On the inside.

667
00:35:20,060 --> 00:35:22,380
Dude, my farts will fucking burn a hole through that thing.

668
00:35:22,380 --> 00:35:27,140
This is my idea, copy written.

669
00:35:27,140 --> 00:35:30,660
This gets fucking made after this.

670
00:35:30,660 --> 00:35:32,860
Legally I can sue, I think.

671
00:35:32,860 --> 00:35:33,860
Because you said that you can.

672
00:35:33,860 --> 00:35:39,260
Because I said it on here and I'm putting this idea out there.

673
00:35:39,260 --> 00:35:40,260
Alright.

674
00:35:40,260 --> 00:35:41,260
Here, so this.

675
00:35:41,260 --> 00:35:42,720
So this idea is a million dollars.

676
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:43,720
This is a million dollars.

677
00:35:43,720 --> 00:35:44,720
- Okay, say it.

678
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:46,420
- But not for you, for him.

679
00:35:46,420 --> 00:35:50,420
- So it's a Bluetooth-controlled flush-like thing,

680
00:35:50,420 --> 00:35:54,960
like a Bluetooth-controlled handle for your toilet,

681
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:55,800
or like one of those,

682
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:57,400
you know how there's like the toilet things

683
00:35:57,400 --> 00:36:00,120
where it's like one for pee, one for poop?

684
00:36:00,120 --> 00:36:00,960
- Yeah.

685
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:01,780
- Those handles?

686
00:36:01,780 --> 00:36:02,620
So it's one of those,

687
00:36:02,620 --> 00:36:05,360
and then the poop one has like a Bluetooth-connected thing

688
00:36:05,360 --> 00:36:09,280
to one of those automatic Febreze things.

689
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:12,040
So any time that the toilet handle

690
00:36:13,480 --> 00:36:18,940
gets the poop one gets flushed it'll spray Febreze automatically or any kind

691
00:36:18,940 --> 00:36:23,600
of air freshener. Why not just put an air freshener in the bathroom? Well yeah but but then you

692
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:28,800
you don't have to air freshen yourself. Yeah, if you put like an automatic timed

693
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:33,400
air freshener thing that's only go this is immediately after you poop because

694
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:37,320
that is the worst time like going into the bathroom after somebody else that's

695
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:42,840
the worst. If you did it earlier today with Neil you told them to eat fragrance.

696
00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:48,880
I was joking it didn't smell that bad. I know but have you ever gone into a

697
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:51,760
bathroom after somebody's pooped? Sometimes I'll sit in there a little

698
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:56,840
extra time after I've pooped just to kind of soak it in. That's disgusting. Why?

699
00:36:56,840 --> 00:37:02,080
That's a million dollars. You grow brown acne the next day.

700
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:06,680
Yeah dude you sit in there you know just make sure it's all gone like I said

701
00:37:06,680 --> 00:37:11,440
huff it up. So it's a Bluetooth toilet handle. That's my idea. What about a

702
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:15,080
got a bluetooth toilet and you can play music and music comes out of the bowl,

703
00:37:15,080 --> 00:37:18,580
so that's feeling on your on your toilet. If it's bluetooth connected, your

704
00:37:18,580 --> 00:37:22,080
toilet could get hacked. I have a way better. Yeah, I have a way better thing

705
00:37:22,080 --> 00:37:24,920
custom candle smells like your own fart.

706
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:31,160
It's not a bad idea. It's a pretty good idea. Why it's a really good novelty

707
00:37:31,160 --> 00:37:33,640
idea that is that would make a lot of money. If people send that to their

708
00:37:33,640 --> 00:37:38,760
friends, yeah, if you miss me, here's my fart exactly yeah yeah yeah people

709
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:40,800
about the good smells about people, but you smell the bad smells more often.

710
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:42,800
The candle has methane in it, so when you light it, it just explodes.

711
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:44,800
It's a stick of dynamite.

712
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:46,800
Yeah.

713
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:48,800
I don't know.

714
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:50,800
I think I have a lot of different great

715
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:52,800
Spencer's Gift style ideas

716
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:54,800
for farts and poop. Yeah? Yeah.

717
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:56,800
I think a custom prank poop

718
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:58,800
like those custom dildos you can get, that might

719
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:00,800
be pretty good. One that looks exactly like one of

720
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:02,800
your real poops. Those are crazy. The custom

721
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:04,800
custom dildos. Custom silicone dildo

722
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:06,800
things. Those are insane. Yeah, I wonder if you can

723
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:13,600
the ratio and size it up or down or down I say yeah that's the thing about it is

724
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:20,960
like you're gonna keep your dick hard in a mold and then pour silicone in it well

725
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:24,400
that's fine it's I'm sure there's a lot of people that would be like the easiest

726
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:30,680
thing ever to do what what is the most a lot of people who can probably only get

727
00:38:30,680 --> 00:38:36,240
whatever the mold is made out of that like it's gonna get in your pee hole you

728
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:40,680
got to get-- I think that's kind of the appeal, right? Is like-- Getting stuff in your-- No, but you get

729
00:38:40,680 --> 00:38:45,800
your pee hole measured as well. Putting like clay in your penis hole. You are misreading me so much right now and I

730
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:53,420
don't feel like you're listening. You, there, once the, you want to, everybody wants to know how big is my

731
00:38:53,420 --> 00:38:57,840
pee hole really? Because you can't see it when you're doing it. Okay, yeah. You know, so if you got--

732
00:38:57,840 --> 00:39:01,680
You could get, yeah, if you get a mold of your pee hole, you get it down to the millimeter.

733
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:06,200
here. Exactly, yeah. It's a perfect, it's a machinist's penis. Do they do the balls

734
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:12,060
in the custom dildo too? I think it's extra. Balls are extra. Yeah, shafts gonna

735
00:39:12,060 --> 00:39:15,720
run you about 120. Balls are gonna be extra. If you don't pay for the balls, they

736
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:22,740
automatically give you the smallest, wrinkliest balls possible. Yeah, one of the co-owners is an old old man

737
00:39:22,740 --> 00:39:28,880
with tiny balls and they just put his balls on there. They give you one tiny ball. Yeah, and a

738
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:33,280
tattoo that says my weird ball on the ball sack. Yeah on your actual ball sack.

739
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:37,040
Here's a question if you got that done are you giving it to someone or are you

740
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:41,900
keeping that bad boy? Putting it up yourself. Dude hang it like a like a like

741
00:39:41,900 --> 00:39:49,200
I caught a bear. Yeah like one of those like bass. Yeah exactly. Make it sing a

742
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:55,700
reggae song. Yeah that might be cool. Make it sing past the dutchie. Yeah it's the

743
00:39:55,700 --> 00:40:02,100
only song my penis would sing. Yeah. Number two is cinnamon buns. Um, first I got

744
00:40:02,100 --> 00:40:05,740
some, you can, hey I can make cinnamon buns out of my own farts. I'll just put

745
00:40:05,740 --> 00:40:10,580
cinnamon on my thing, on my butthole. What? Calling your butthole your thing is

746
00:40:10,580 --> 00:40:14,980
pretty funny. You only have one thing. Yeah, yeah you guys should have smelled a

747
00:40:14,980 --> 00:40:20,160
fart that just came out of my wiener. That means my butthole. Yeah, if I could

748
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:25,460
have a perfect fart smell, I think it would be something, I think a fart should

749
00:40:25,460 --> 00:40:29,380
smell really bad so I want something that I can I can garlic yeah I want

750
00:40:29,380 --> 00:40:32,740
something I can use like a defense mechanism burning rubber yeah something

751
00:40:32,740 --> 00:40:39,060
like that you know methane yeah something something that someone walks

752
00:40:39,060 --> 00:40:42,700
in the room and like because also if your first cement that would be a good

753
00:40:42,700 --> 00:40:48,420
for this kind of like industrial have you guys ever walked near like a waste

754
00:40:48,420 --> 00:40:52,300
treatment plant who ever smelled like a yeah I used to live near one there the

755
00:40:52,300 --> 00:40:56,700
one in Boston that's on that big island with the giant like egg-shaped things.

756
00:40:56,700 --> 00:40:59,580
I don't know, that's like a really pretty walk because there's like lots of water,

757
00:40:59,580 --> 00:41:04,020
but there's points where like it will like you're about to throw up like it's

758
00:41:04,020 --> 00:41:09,620
like the worst smell like if you think poop smells bad you got to smell waste.

759
00:41:09,620 --> 00:41:18,580
It smells so bad. The only smell worse than poop is a million poops mixed together.

760
00:41:18,580 --> 00:41:20,580
versus waste dichotomy.

761
00:41:20,580 --> 00:41:23,980
- One poop is weak, a million are strong.

762
00:41:23,980 --> 00:41:25,180
- Did you guys hear that?

763
00:41:25,180 --> 00:41:26,020
- The what?

764
00:41:26,020 --> 00:41:26,840
- I said dichotomy.

765
00:41:26,840 --> 00:41:27,680
- Wow, that's big.

766
00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:28,620
- I'm used to you saying it now.

767
00:41:28,620 --> 00:41:30,520
You said that's the second time you said it, so.

768
00:41:30,520 --> 00:41:32,440
- What kind of other dichotomies do you like?

769
00:41:32,440 --> 00:41:34,300
- Shit versus crap.

770
00:41:34,300 --> 00:41:35,260
- Tell me what that one is.

771
00:41:35,260 --> 00:41:37,260
- Pee pee versus wee wee.

772
00:41:37,260 --> 00:41:38,620
- I wanna, you have to explain these.

773
00:41:38,620 --> 00:41:42,780
- Okay, well pee pee is pee and wee wee is yes in French.

774
00:41:42,780 --> 00:41:44,060
(laughing)

775
00:41:44,060 --> 00:41:45,960
- It's yes twice I believe.

776
00:41:45,960 --> 00:41:46,800
- Yeah.

777
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:47,640
- So you're kinda owned there.

778
00:41:47,640 --> 00:41:58,680
I was a study by Monsieur. Monsieur? Really? Yeah, I went to France and I met a guy named

779
00:41:58,680 --> 00:42:09,120
Monsieur. Yeah, that was Croc Monsieur who told me that. Number three, flowers.

780
00:42:09,120 --> 00:42:14,040
Flowers sometimes smell bad. Yeah, do you know what I... There's that one

781
00:42:14,040 --> 00:42:17,520
stinky penis flower. If your fart smells like baby's breath, I might report you to the police. You guys know

782
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:20,920
the stinky penis, the rotting corpse flower, the stinky penis flower?

783
00:42:20,920 --> 00:42:21,920
No.

784
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:22,920
It's like a, what's it called?

785
00:42:22,920 --> 00:42:24,360
It's called the stinky penis flower.

786
00:42:24,360 --> 00:42:26,600
Is that the same as the tree that smells like cum?

787
00:42:26,600 --> 00:42:27,600
No.

788
00:42:27,600 --> 00:42:28,600
No.

789
00:42:28,600 --> 00:42:29,600
It's like a huge titan arum.

790
00:42:29,600 --> 00:42:30,600
They call it a magic tree.

791
00:42:30,600 --> 00:42:31,600
That's not it.

792
00:42:31,600 --> 00:42:34,480
Amorphophallus titanum.

793
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:40,840
It's like a big flower that smells like rotting flesh and they named it, it's like a penis

794
00:42:40,840 --> 00:42:41,840
too.

795
00:42:41,840 --> 00:42:43,600
Well, how do you, the person who-

796
00:42:43,600 --> 00:42:44,760
That shit look like corn.

797
00:42:44,760 --> 00:42:46,920
The person who named this knew what rotting flesh smelled like.

798
00:42:46,920 --> 00:42:48,040
- Like a flesh that smelled like.

799
00:42:48,040 --> 00:42:48,880
- Yeah.

800
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:50,720
- So, that's messed up.

801
00:42:50,720 --> 00:42:51,560
That person's a psycho.

802
00:42:51,560 --> 00:42:53,880
- Due to its odor, like that of a rotting corpse,

803
00:42:53,880 --> 00:42:55,840
it is characterized as a carrying flower.

804
00:42:55,840 --> 00:42:57,320
- Linces-something tree?

805
00:42:57,320 --> 00:42:58,160
It starts with an L.

806
00:42:58,160 --> 00:43:00,960
- I don't know much about cum trees.

807
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:03,800
- There was a Mitchell and Webb sketch about 'em.

808
00:43:03,800 --> 00:43:05,920
- Is that what the Japanese suicide forest is filled with

809
00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:07,160
and that's why people kill themselves?

810
00:43:07,160 --> 00:43:08,440
(laughing)

811
00:43:08,440 --> 00:43:10,440
Ugh, it goddamn smells like cum in here.

812
00:43:10,440 --> 00:43:11,720
- Oh, what the fuck?

813
00:43:11,720 --> 00:43:12,560
- Thank God.

814
00:43:12,560 --> 00:43:13,400
- Why do I know what it smells like?

815
00:43:13,400 --> 00:43:14,220
(sputtering)

816
00:43:14,220 --> 00:43:15,320
- Thank God I brought my samurai sword.

817
00:43:15,320 --> 00:43:19,400
I'm on the I'm on the Wikipedia page for the dead penis flower and one of the

818
00:43:19,400 --> 00:43:24,220

823
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:54,520
saying it's a flower so like if you want to yeah I think for me if a fart smelled

824
00:43:54,520 --> 00:43:58,760
like flowers I would be worried about the pollen content fart smelled like flour

825
00:43:58,760 --> 00:44:03,520
like the yeah like baking that would be perfect cuz I've never smelled flower

826
00:44:03,520 --> 00:44:11,000
releases a cloud of the room yeah yeah I guess would you trade would I do if you

827
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:17,240
if you okay would you rather have a fart that is a cloud of flour or a jet of sand

828
00:44:17,240 --> 00:44:22,200
jettisoning fucking fly yeah no it's like one it's like a small

829
00:44:22,200 --> 00:44:27,800
segment and yeah like a like a straight line a cloud of flour yeah but then

830
00:44:27,800 --> 00:44:30,680
you're walking around you got all fucking looks like a sad not if we can

831
00:44:30,680 --> 00:44:36,040
if if we could see our farts like cloud of flour style if we could see him I feel

832
00:44:36,040 --> 00:44:39,800
like a lot of problems in the world to be solved and everybody had a unique

833
00:44:39,800 --> 00:44:45,840
color so that you know exactly who who dealt it as it were yeah whoever felt it

834
00:44:45,840 --> 00:44:50,240
yeah I can see that that has red dealt it so that one's you mom mm-hmm yeah yeah

835
00:44:50,240 --> 00:44:53,920
yeah but then you got to get into like the different hues maybe like a family

836
00:44:53,920 --> 00:44:59,040
like a familial mmm yeah I guess do your family do your farts smell like your

837
00:44:59,040 --> 00:45:06,960
families would you rather smell you guys my brother was visiting I farted at some

838
00:45:06,960 --> 00:45:09,840
point and he said he said dude I was walking behind you and I smelled

839
00:45:09,840 --> 00:45:13,840
something and I was like that's my fart.

840
00:45:13,840 --> 00:45:19,280
So maybe there has to be some connection there right? Yeah.

841
00:45:19,280 --> 00:45:22,720
I guess if you eat the same foods that your family does.

842
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:25,760
Maybe your gut you have the same gut biome. Yeah.

843
00:45:25,760 --> 00:45:30,000
When I have kids I'm gonna feed them the most disgusting food ever just

844
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:33,600
to make their farts horrible. Yeah. Just so everybody knows they

845
00:45:33,600 --> 00:45:38,960
smell and they're like oh that's a very thing you say I want my kids farts to

846
00:45:38,960 --> 00:45:47,600
stay oh yeah that's normal parenting shit oh I hope my kids smell so bad I'm a

847
00:45:47,600 --> 00:45:53,160
tiger mom and I'm having a stinky fucking fart kids of all time I'm gonna

848
00:45:53,160 --> 00:45:57,320

849
00:45:57,320 --> 00:46:04,840
cologne. If I if I smelled like if I took it like if I farted and it smelled like

850
00:46:04,840 --> 00:46:11,600
axe chocolate or something. Yeah. Yeah. That axe chocolate was fucking pungent.

851
00:46:11,600 --> 00:46:15,680
That was the scariest smell. That shit'll get you kicked out the locker room. You

852
00:46:15,680 --> 00:46:22,760
when you smell axe chocolate you know. I'm near. You're about to get wedgie. I

853
00:46:22,760 --> 00:46:27,560
I told you guys about the time I got on the bus at like probably 7 a.m. in the

854
00:46:27,560 --> 00:46:31,400
middle of the winter so freezing cold. Yeah, he told me. Yeah, somebody was wearing

855
00:46:31,400 --> 00:46:36,300
Axe body spray and the driver started screaming and was like, like, "You are

856
00:46:36,300 --> 00:46:40,120
going to give me an asthma attack!" and then opened like all the windows and

857
00:46:40,120 --> 00:46:43,040
let every time the bus stopped at a red light he opened all the doors all the

858
00:46:43,040 --> 00:46:48,240
way and it was like freezing cold and you're just screaming the entire bus ride.

859
00:46:48,240 --> 00:46:53,280
bus drivers bad people yeah I'll tell you but I think fourth-class citizens

860
00:46:53,280 --> 00:46:58,440
probably that probably when I like first started doing this with you guys I got

861
00:46:58,440 --> 00:47:04,080
like I was waiting for the bus to go to class one morning and like the bus

862
00:47:04,080 --> 00:47:07,600
driver was driving like fucking crazy like she let me on for free but she like

863
00:47:07,600 --> 00:47:12,840
came off of the highway or whatever and just kind of like pulled around like

864
00:47:12,840 --> 00:47:16,840
like she didn't drift, but she like she took you drifted. You can be honest.

865
00:47:16,840 --> 00:47:21,540
I fucking hope I don't I don't I just remember her opening the door and

866
00:47:21,540 --> 00:47:26,340
screaming get on to everybody. That's what that that crazy bus driver the

867
00:47:26,340 --> 00:47:29,640
axe guy. I had him a few times. He does that too. He would he wouldn't pull

868
00:47:29,640 --> 00:47:32,840
over. He would stop just in the middle of the street and then he would just

869
00:47:32,840 --> 00:47:34,940
open the doors and people would just be like what are you doing and he would

870
00:47:34,940 --> 00:47:38,140
go like this. He would like just move like a really angry and like beckon

871
00:47:38,140 --> 00:47:41,340
with his whole arm to them like what are you doing? Yeah, that was the

872
00:47:41,340 --> 00:47:48,320
I mean Boston that was a crazy bus. Yeah, it's a crazy. You guys ever get on the cash bus where you could play trivia games

873
00:47:48,320 --> 00:47:50,320
I wish yeah

874
00:47:50,320 --> 00:47:56,560
That would be money back. Yeah, exactly. Ooh. Yeah, you'll see one fucking cash cab since I moved here

875
00:47:56,560 --> 00:48:02,600
Yeah, you gotta look for the driver dude. The driver is a telltale sign. Have you seen the QA non people?

876
00:48:02,600 --> 00:48:04,960
who

877
00:48:04,960 --> 00:48:06,960
like say that

878
00:48:06,960 --> 00:48:10,160
Derek Chauvin was a crisis actor

879
00:48:10,160 --> 00:48:16,520
actor and the guy who the crisis actor who is playing Derek Chauvin is the

880
00:48:16,520 --> 00:48:17,520
cash cab guy.

881
00:48:17,520 --> 00:48:18,520
Have you seen those?

882
00:48:18,520 --> 00:48:19,520
No fucking way dude.

883
00:48:19,520 --> 00:48:20,520
Yeah.

884
00:48:20,520 --> 00:48:21,520
Dude.

885
00:48:21,520 --> 00:48:22,520
I have not seen that.

886
00:48:22,520 --> 00:48:23,520
That's sick.

887
00:48:23,520 --> 00:48:28,240
It's so fucking funny because it's like, don't you think he's out driving

888
00:48:28,240 --> 00:48:29,240
the cab?

889
00:48:29,240 --> 00:48:33,240
Like what the fuck?

890
00:48:33,240 --> 00:48:34,640
Yeah I liked it that.

891
00:48:34,640 --> 00:48:36,880
The crisis actor thing is so funny because it's like.

892
00:48:36,880 --> 00:48:37,880
This guy's turned it.

893
00:48:37,880 --> 00:48:41,700
In fact, the idea that a crisis actor would be like an actor and not just like a

894
00:48:41,700 --> 00:48:42,700
random person.

895
00:48:42,700 --> 00:48:46,040
Right, somebody that they're like, "God damn, he did so fucking well at Sandy Hook,

896
00:48:46,040 --> 00:48:47,040
we gotta hire him again."

897
00:48:47,040 --> 00:48:53,000
Yeah, dude, he's like, he's like just an amazing, he's like the Robert De Niro.

898
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:54,000
The crisis actor Oscars.

899
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:58,720
No, like the idea, the idea that like the crisis actor would be like a guy who had

900
00:48:58,720 --> 00:49:01,280
been on TV before and was like a known actor.

901
00:49:01,280 --> 00:49:02,280
Yeah.

902
00:49:02,280 --> 00:49:03,280
Yeah, instead of, yeah.

903
00:49:03,280 --> 00:49:05,960
But just the crisis actor Oscars, it's a very funny.

904
00:49:05,960 --> 00:49:06,960
Yeah.

905
00:49:06,960 --> 00:49:15,920

910
00:49:39,240 --> 00:49:42,680
You two are my best friends. I couldn't have done this without my

911
00:49:42,680 --> 00:49:47,840
executive producer, the devil. And now I'd like to end my speech with a trivia

912
00:49:47,840 --> 00:49:58,760
question. Who is my best friend? Me! Me! The devil! Yeah dude, if you got approached to be a crisis

913
00:49:58,760 --> 00:50:02,680
actor, would you do it? Yes, 100%. Especially with everything I have going,

914
00:50:02,680 --> 00:50:07,380
I like hey, haven't I seen that yeah can I dress up like it's the renaissance

915
00:50:07,380 --> 00:50:11,580
fair, though, so doing a crisis actor audition self tape and it's going

916
00:50:11,580 --> 00:50:26,620
oh God, it's so scary. Every time my girlfriend comes home, I'm pretending to

917
00:50:26,620 --> 00:50:28,640
be dead somewhere preparing for the role.

918
00:50:30,900 --> 00:50:39,400
You don't understand it's really hard. It's method being on being on on your

919
00:50:39,400 --> 00:50:44,600
audition tape where you're pretending to be dead and somebody's tickling you and

920
00:50:44,600 --> 00:50:52,360
I only laughed once. That's the yeah yeah we need to get and this is this is if

921
00:50:52,360 --> 00:50:58,080
Robin Williams was dead. Oh yeah I'm just doing different doing an SNL real shot

922
00:50:58,080 --> 00:50:59,200
I've been shot.

923
00:50:59,200 --> 00:51:00,200
Saturated away.

924
00:51:00,200 --> 00:51:01,200
Saturated away.

925
00:51:01,200 --> 00:51:05,040
Yeah, I think that I'd probably be an amazing crisis actor.

926
00:51:05,040 --> 00:51:07,480
Probably because I mean it's a shame I'm not such a good drag queen.

927
00:51:07,480 --> 00:51:08,480
I'm easily disguised.

928
00:51:08,480 --> 00:51:09,800
Because you look like Trixie Patel.

929
00:51:09,800 --> 00:51:10,800
Yeah, exactly.

930
00:51:10,800 --> 00:51:12,160
I'm very easily disguised.

931
00:51:12,160 --> 00:51:14,840
Any sort of wig or prosthetics would probably fit pretty well on my face.

932
00:51:14,840 --> 00:51:16,600
We gotta go to the wig store here.

933
00:51:16,600 --> 00:51:18,440
I'm trying to get a giant devil costume.

934
00:51:18,440 --> 00:51:19,440
Yeah?

935
00:51:19,440 --> 00:51:21,760
Yeah, with like a full facial makeup kit and shit.

936
00:51:21,760 --> 00:51:23,240
Yeah, like a Tim Curry legend.

937
00:51:23,240 --> 00:51:24,240
Yeah, yeah, exactly.

938
00:51:24,240 --> 00:51:26,640
One of those full like thousands of dollars.

939
00:51:26,640 --> 00:51:27,640
I was looking.

940
00:51:27,640 --> 00:51:31,640
Oh those the Star Trek prosthetics. We should get him. We should get him Ferengi'd up.

941
00:51:31,640 --> 00:51:33,640
You trying to Ferengi me?

942
00:51:33,640 --> 00:51:35,640
You would be an amazing Ferengi.

943
00:51:35,640 --> 00:51:37,640
You mean it?

944
00:51:37,640 --> 00:51:39,640
Yeah. My interview of my crisis acting career.

945
00:51:39,640 --> 00:51:43,640
This is if a Ferengi got killed.

946
00:51:43,640 --> 00:51:51,640
Casualties apparently over 80 people and one Wookiee on the scene has died.

947
00:51:51,640 --> 00:51:53,640
Just watching the news.

948
00:51:53,640 --> 00:51:55,640
I was watching the news and just like, "Wait, hold on."

949
00:51:55,640 --> 00:51:57,640
"That's me! That's me!"

950
00:51:57,640 --> 00:51:59,640
"Is that a- what the hell?"

951
00:51:59,640 --> 00:52:01,640
"CHEWBACCA'S DEAD?!"

952
00:52:01,640 --> 00:52:05,640
"It appears Darth Maul is one of the victims claimed by the deadly shooting."

953
00:52:05,640 --> 00:52:07,640
*laughter*

954
00:52:07,640 --> 00:52:09,640
*laughter*

955
00:52:09,640 --> 00:52:11,640
"You went off script, kid!"

956
00:52:11,640 --> 00:52:13,640
"You're never working in this town again!"

957
00:52:13,640 --> 00:52:16,640
"Oh, jeez, I just wanted to bring something to the role that no one else was doing!"

958
00:52:16,640 --> 00:52:18,640
"I was trying to get noticed, okay?"

959
00:52:18,640 --> 00:52:20,640
"Sometimes you gotta make big risks."

960
00:52:20,640 --> 00:52:22,640
"Look, they're filming a new Star Wars movie."

961
00:52:22,640 --> 00:52:27,720
I I just thought maybe they would have seen me yeah hundreds are dead

962
00:52:27,720 --> 00:52:33,040
including and a green alien carrying a guy by the waist

963
00:52:33,040 --> 00:52:42,680
unfortunately this tragedy took the life of the killer from scream who also had a

964
00:52:42,680 --> 00:52:47,600
really cool pump that made red blood something is seriously wrong here this

965
00:52:47,600 --> 00:52:54,000
slutty cop has died at two different mass shootings. Something is not adding up.

966
00:52:54,000 --> 00:53:01,440
Yeah, doing a COVID interview as a nurse but just clearly dressed in like the enema of the state.

967
00:53:01,440 --> 00:53:13,040
All right, number five is peppermint. Yeah, whatever. Yeah, what am I, a fucking little boy?

968
00:53:13,600 --> 00:53:18,800
You know what? I have been using Dr. Bronner's, uh, like the peppermint Castile soap or whatever it's called.

969
00:53:18,800 --> 00:53:20,800
Yeah, have you been eating it so you can fart it out?

970
00:53:20,800 --> 00:53:21,600
No, it's just...

971
00:53:21,600 --> 00:53:23,200
You know, I've- I've-

972
00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:28,000
Do they still claim that you can, like, make, like, a French dressing with that and shit?

973
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:28,800
Um...

974
00:53:28,800 --> 00:53:36,600
They replaced the bottle I got, at least. I think his sons, uh, the Dr. Bronner's sons have taken over the bottle.

975
00:53:36,600 --> 00:53:38,000
No. That's horrible.

976
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:38,800
The Bronner brothers?

977
00:53:38,800 --> 00:53:44,480
The Brawner brothers have taken over and all of the things on the bottle now are like pro

978
00:53:44,480 --> 00:53:47,040
psychedelic therapy and like there's one-

979
00:53:47,040 --> 00:53:48,080
Oh that was like the dad's-

980
00:53:48,080 --> 00:53:48,080
I was reading it-

981
00:53:48,080 --> 00:53:51,040
That was like Brawner's thing. It was like all of his thing was like,

982
00:53:51,040 --> 00:53:55,040
"You can use this to brush your teeth and it'll make you closer to God."

983
00:53:55,040 --> 00:54:00,400
All the closer to God stuff and like chickens are like the best thing you can eat or whatever.

984
00:54:00,400 --> 00:54:02,640
All that is gone now and now it's all like,

985
00:54:02,640 --> 00:54:07,520
like pretty like woke, like depression, the silent killer, like-

986
00:54:08,480 --> 00:54:10,240
Working for Google cured my depression.

987
00:54:10,240 --> 00:54:12,000
Yeah, just like kind of shit like that.

988
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:18,400
Like it's very sad to see all of the cool stuff on the Dr. Bronner's label.

989
00:54:18,400 --> 00:54:25,120
Getting a Dr. Bronner bottle where the factory messed up and it just has the like Chipotle.

990
00:54:25,120 --> 00:54:29,200
It's Sarah Silverman's Chipotle story.

991
00:54:29,200 --> 00:54:31,200
"Tea's so good you'll lose your mind."

992
00:54:31,200 --> 00:54:37,200
It's crazy how good you have to be at making soap for them to let you put like stuff on

993
00:54:37,200 --> 00:54:39,440
on the label that you can't say on the news.

994
00:54:39,440 --> 00:54:40,280
- Yeah. - You know what I mean?

995
00:54:40,280 --> 00:54:43,680
Like, that has to be like the greatest soap ever made, right?

996
00:54:43,680 --> 00:54:44,680
- Oh, it is. - Yeah.

997
00:54:44,680 --> 00:54:47,040
- It's 100, I love using that.

998
00:54:47,040 --> 00:54:49,080
Dude, get, I--

999
00:54:49,080 --> 00:54:51,200
- It's the same thing with like Chick-fil-A and In-N-Out.

1000
00:54:51,200 --> 00:54:53,580
Like, their food is so good that they can be Christian.

1001
00:54:53,580 --> 00:54:55,320
That's exactly how I feel about Dr. Bronner's.

1002
00:54:55,320 --> 00:54:57,260
Like, that's gotta be the best soap in the world.

1003
00:54:57,260 --> 00:54:59,640
- Yeah, but I was gonna say,

1004
00:54:59,640 --> 00:55:01,440
I've been using the peppermint soap.

1005
00:55:01,440 --> 00:55:06,080
Kind of upsetting, I mean, I wash my ass with it.

1006
00:55:06,080 --> 00:55:08,580
I would think that my farts would smell like peppermint

1007
00:55:08,580 --> 00:55:09,420
after using it.

1008
00:55:09,420 --> 00:55:10,240
- Nah, Dan.

1009
00:55:10,240 --> 00:55:13,640
- But no, it's just a very like menthol-y, very minty,

1010
00:55:13,640 --> 00:55:17,800
I mean if you walk, if you put that shit on your body,

1011
00:55:17,800 --> 00:55:20,220
you get out of the shower and you walk into a cold room.

1012
00:55:20,220 --> 00:55:22,320
- Yeah, it's curtains.

1013
00:55:22,320 --> 00:55:23,160
- Uh-huh.

1014
00:55:23,160 --> 00:55:25,480
- Yeah, walk around, you smell like the damn candy man

1015
00:55:25,480 --> 00:55:26,300
in here.

1016
00:55:26,300 --> 00:55:28,400
- The mint hitting the cold air on your nuts.

1017
00:55:28,400 --> 00:55:29,800
- Yeah, exactly.

1018
00:55:29,800 --> 00:55:31,040
- It's an insane feeling.

1019
00:55:31,040 --> 00:55:31,880
- Yeah, it's not good.

1020
00:55:31,880 --> 00:55:33,440
Very, it's also very medicinal.

1021
00:55:33,440 --> 00:55:35,800
- This is Dr. Bronner's challenge.

1022
00:55:35,800 --> 00:55:37,440
You tell me your story.

1023
00:55:37,440 --> 00:55:38,760
- Put that shit all over you,

1024
00:55:38,760 --> 00:55:41,400
walk into a restaurant freezer,

1025
00:55:41,400 --> 00:55:42,600
and then see how you feel.

1026
00:55:42,600 --> 00:55:43,680
See if you can last 10 minutes.

1027
00:55:43,680 --> 00:55:46,520
- You gotta go use the shower in the back of the restaurant

1028
00:55:46,520 --> 00:55:48,320
that all restaurants have.

1029
00:55:48,320 --> 00:55:49,520
Little insider secret.

1030
00:55:49,520 --> 00:55:51,160
- It's like a secret menu type thing.

1031
00:55:51,160 --> 00:55:52,000
Like they have to let you--

1032
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:53,200
- Can I use your shower?

1033
00:55:53,200 --> 00:55:58,200
- Let me get like a number six, two apple pies,

1034
00:55:58,200 --> 00:56:00,460
and a number clean.

1035
00:56:00,460 --> 00:56:03,440
- God damn.

1036
00:56:03,440 --> 00:56:05,840
I wish that they'd never learned the secret menu.

1037
00:56:05,840 --> 00:56:07,280
Oh, fuck.

1038
00:56:07,280 --> 00:56:08,880
Keep having to give people a hall pass

1039
00:56:08,880 --> 00:56:10,780
to walk back and use the shower.

1040
00:56:10,780 --> 00:56:12,080
Somebody's in there right now.

1041
00:56:12,080 --> 00:56:14,240
(laughing)

1042
00:56:14,240 --> 00:56:17,040
That's like the ice cream machine broke thing.

1043
00:56:17,040 --> 00:56:17,880
Yeah.

1044
00:56:17,880 --> 00:56:19,920
Sorry, somebody's in the shower right now.

1045
00:56:19,920 --> 00:56:20,760
Yeah, there's somebody in the shower actually.

1046
00:56:20,760 --> 00:56:25,720
We should put a secret menu on the podcast.

1047
00:56:25,720 --> 00:56:27,000
Yeah. There is one.

1048
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:27,840
There is.

1049
00:56:27,840 --> 00:56:28,660
You guys don't know it.

1050
00:56:28,660 --> 00:56:29,980
I'm the only one that knows it.

1051
00:56:29,980 --> 00:56:31,380
Really? It's a secret, yeah.

1052
00:56:31,380 --> 00:56:32,220
Can I try?

1053
00:56:32,220 --> 00:56:33,060
You can try.

1054
00:56:33,060 --> 00:56:35,180
- Camera naked.

1055
00:56:35,180 --> 00:56:38,460
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

1056
00:56:38,460 --> 00:56:41,820
- Sometimes you just get exactly what you want in life.

1057
00:56:41,820 --> 00:56:43,900
It's really a beautiful fact.

1058
00:56:43,900 --> 00:56:45,740
Number six is honey.

1059
00:56:45,740 --> 00:56:47,020
Honey doesn't smell.

1060
00:56:47,020 --> 00:56:48,660
I ain't no damn bee.

1061
00:56:48,660 --> 00:56:50,620
That's a bee's job to fart some honey out.

1062
00:56:50,620 --> 00:56:52,980
- Yeah, I don't think honey smells.

1063
00:56:52,980 --> 00:56:53,940
- Smells what?

1064
00:56:53,940 --> 00:56:54,780
It does.

1065
00:56:54,780 --> 00:56:57,100
Go smell my honey.

1066
00:56:57,100 --> 00:56:59,060
- I wanna smell you, honey.

1067
00:56:59,060 --> 00:56:59,900
- Smell my honey.

1068
00:56:59,900 --> 00:57:00,780
- Go smell my honey.

1069
00:57:01,940 --> 00:57:02,440
Go!

1070
00:57:02,440 --> 00:57:02,940
What?

1071
00:57:02,940 --> 00:57:03,820
Go! It's in there!

1072
00:57:03,820 --> 00:57:04,860
Go smell it!

1073
00:57:04,860 --> 00:57:05,900
Give it a whiff!

1074
00:57:05,900 --> 00:57:07,300
Go get it!

1075
00:57:07,300 --> 00:57:08,780
Go get my honey and smell that!

1076
00:57:08,780 --> 00:57:10,300
Put the mic down and go get the honey!

1077
00:57:10,300 --> 00:57:11,340
Put your nose in my honey!

1078
00:57:11,340 --> 00:57:14,520
Do it!

1079
00:57:14,520 --> 00:57:16,300
I hate you.

1080
00:57:16,300 --> 00:57:17,340
Go smell my honey!

1081
00:57:17,340 --> 00:57:18,900
[laughter]

1082
00:57:18,900 --> 00:57:20,340
Such a weird thing!

1083
00:57:20,340 --> 00:57:21,140
There's nothing weird about that.

1084
00:57:21,140 --> 00:57:22,100
It's a weird thing to say!

1085
00:57:22,100 --> 00:57:22,740
No.

00:57:22,740 --> 00:57:23,900

1105
00:58:46,140 --> 00:58:50,540
made some sauce that's too long for me that's a little bit of a reddit name for

1106
00:58:50,540 --> 00:58:54,420
For a sauce I would say I don't think that's a reddit name. I think it is a little bit of a reddit name

1107
00:58:54,420 --> 00:58:58,660
It's too long. It's like dr. Maborium. Let's just call it a room T

But it's called the roof is teague made some sauce. I just leave that last part out

1110
00:59:07,380 --> 00:59:12,680
That sounds pretty funny. It is funny, but it's like I think barbecue sauce names

1111
00:59:12,680 --> 00:59:19,780
Definitely too horny. Do you think I'm gonna make an operation that lets you make your fart smell like bilge water if you want

1112
00:59:19,780 --> 00:59:26,500
What's bilgewater? Like from a ship? Are you a seaman?

1113
00:59:26,500 --> 00:59:29,460
Is this something I didn't know about you? Is it the water that collects in the bottom of a ship?

1114
00:59:29,460 --> 00:59:34,980
Bilgewater? I'm not a pirate. Why would I know this dude?

1115
00:59:34,980 --> 00:59:38,820
Arrgh, they should make your farts smell like a scarlet knot.

1116
00:59:38,820 --> 00:59:43,940
A scarlet knot? You mean a garlic knot? No, a scarlet knot.

1117
00:59:43,940 --> 00:59:48,500
It's a kind of pirate knot. So you know a scarlet knot but not bilgewater?

1118
00:59:48,500 --> 00:59:49,340
- Bilge water. - Bilge water.

1119
00:59:49,340 --> 00:59:51,260
- I think it actually made up a scarlet knot, maybe.

1120
00:59:51,260 --> 00:59:52,100
- Yeah, it's-- - Trying to come up

1121
00:59:52,100 --> 00:59:54,220
with a kind of a piratey knot.

1122
00:59:54,220 --> 00:59:56,780
- Yeah? - Yeah.

1123
00:59:56,780 --> 00:59:57,780
- Like brine?

1124
00:59:57,780 --> 01:00:00,900
- Brine? - Like a bag of sand, maybe?

1125
01:00:00,900 --> 01:00:02,980
- Like grog fart? - Yeah, glass?

1126
01:00:02,980 --> 01:00:04,780
- Dog fart? - Grog fart!

1127
01:00:04,780 --> 01:00:08,180
- Could you make my fart smell like glass?

1128
01:00:08,180 --> 01:00:11,140
- Here comes Pat saying, "Oh, a glass doesn't have a smell."

1129
01:00:11,140 --> 01:00:12,980
- Ever had a smell of glass all the time?

1130
01:00:12,980 --> 01:00:14,760
- Aw, you bastard.

1131
01:00:16,620 --> 01:00:19,100
If you smoke weed in it, it smells like weed.

1132
01:00:19,100 --> 01:00:22,300
- Fruit Loops, Febreze, eggs.

1133
01:00:22,300 --> 01:00:23,660
- Fruit Loops.

1134
01:00:23,660 --> 01:00:25,100
- My shit already smells like eggs, dude.

1135
01:00:25,100 --> 01:00:25,940
I don't need no help in that department.

1136
01:00:25,940 --> 01:00:28,020
- You know what, no, Fruit Loops does have like a weird.

1137
01:00:28,020 --> 01:00:28,860
- Yeah, Fruit Loops has a--

1138
01:00:28,860 --> 01:00:31,340
- Fruit Loops has a very good chemically fruity smell.

1139
01:00:31,340 --> 01:00:32,620
- Yeah.

1140
01:00:32,620 --> 01:00:34,420
- Like when you smell, like,

1141
01:00:34,420 --> 01:00:36,140
I had a roommate in community college

1142
01:00:36,140 --> 01:00:40,700
who would vape Fruit Loops vape juice.

1143
01:00:40,700 --> 01:00:43,940
- I had one of those ones that looks like a bad dragon toy.

1144
01:00:43,940 --> 01:00:44,780
One of the like really big--

1145
01:00:44,780 --> 01:00:48,780
box ones yeah he had one of those. How do you carry, you need like a holster for that.

1146
01:00:48,780 --> 01:00:53,460
How do people do that dude? Well I mean he wore like cargo pants. Oh yeah you have

1147
01:00:53,460 --> 01:00:58,220
that's why those guys wear cargo pants. Yeah. They have that big ass thing. Like he would blow

1148
01:00:58,220 --> 01:01:03,060
the smoke and I would smell it and I'd be like we don't have any Froot Loops. Damn I'm hungry.

1149
01:01:03,060 --> 01:01:07,220
Every time I was just like oh yeah fucking vape like I never got used to the

1150
01:01:07,220 --> 01:01:13,460
smell cuz it's like Froot Loops. Somehow 13 is skunk dead animal. If my fart

1151
01:01:13,460 --> 01:01:17,780
smelled like skunk I would use that shit to my advantage yeah I would actually

1152
01:01:17,780 --> 01:01:21,940
probably live the life of a skunk yeah yeah I think about it if I had his power

1153
01:01:21,940 --> 01:01:27,060
but like a pet skunk yeah I'd be like I'd be like a super papa puppy pup pup

1154
01:01:27,060 --> 01:01:34,940
skunk number 28 number 28 is the moon smell like the moon that's actually the

1155
01:01:34,940 --> 01:01:38,620
key to this question is you make it smell like something that you've never

1156
01:01:38,620 --> 01:01:42,340
smelled before but you really want to smell exactly yeah cuz then you know

1157
01:01:42,340 --> 01:01:43,860
- No, you gain knowledge. - One trillion dollars.

1158
01:01:43,860 --> 01:01:45,940
- Yeah, I'm a little bit of a knowledge freak.

1159
01:01:45,940 --> 01:01:48,100
Speaking of farts, I have had to shit so bad

1160
01:01:48,100 --> 01:01:49,500
for an hour and a half. - I want my fart

1161
01:01:49,500 --> 01:01:50,700
to smell like the smell-- - Is this an hour

1162
01:01:50,700 --> 01:01:51,540
and a half? - That when you smell it,

1163
01:01:51,540 --> 01:01:53,620
you get $100.

1164
01:01:53,620 --> 01:01:54,780
- Yeah, exactly, yeah.

1165
01:01:54,780 --> 01:01:57,260
I want my farts to smell like the lottery.

1166
01:01:57,260 --> 01:01:59,780
- A smell so good that people will give you money

1167
01:01:59,780 --> 01:02:00,600
if they smell it.

1168
01:02:00,600 --> 01:02:02,060
- Yeah, exactly, and then I could become

1169
01:02:02,060 --> 01:02:04,420
a traveling farter. - What if, okay.

1170
01:02:04,420 --> 01:02:07,580
Fart smell-- - Tee hee.

1171
01:02:07,580 --> 01:02:11,720
- Like a fart that smells like an eccentric billionaire's

1172
01:02:11,720 --> 01:02:20,080
dead wife. So you wait, you're like a waiter in a restaurant and you're

1173
01:02:20,080 --> 01:02:25,120
like a night, you work at this nice restaurant and then one day you fart on

1174
01:02:25,120 --> 01:02:30,720
the job while you're working. Just fart on Carlos Slim's face. Yeah, someone like that and

1175
01:02:30,720 --> 01:02:37,120
he's just like, oh. Like a loud fart too, I'm not talking like a silent but deadly.

1176
01:02:37,120 --> 01:02:39,920
- They sound like her saying, "Hey honey."

1177
01:02:39,920 --> 01:02:42,180
(laughing)

1178
01:02:42,180 --> 01:02:45,160
- All your farts sound like an eccentric billionaire's

1179
01:02:45,160 --> 01:02:46,000
dead wife.

1180
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:48,040
- And they smell like her too.

1181
01:02:48,040 --> 01:02:50,600
- They say, "Help, I'm trapped in this man's body.

1182
01:02:50,600 --> 01:02:51,680
"Help, help!"

1183
01:02:51,680 --> 01:02:52,840
- They say, "Yeah, help honey,

1184
01:02:52,840 --> 01:02:55,160
"I need you to give this guy a million dollars."

1185
01:02:55,160 --> 01:02:56,000
- He needs it!

1186
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:58,480
I'm stuck in his butt!

1187
01:02:58,480 --> 01:03:02,160
- Now that idea is a million dollars.

1188
01:03:02,160 --> 01:03:03,000
That is a million dollars.

1189
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:04,840
- Thank you for listening to this show.

1190
01:03:04,840 --> 01:03:06,760
