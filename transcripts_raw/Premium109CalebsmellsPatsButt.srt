Let me see your butt!

(laughing)

8
00:00:10,460 --> 00:00:12,320
(explosion)

9
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:13,960
- All right, we're recording.

10
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:16,320
Oh, the sun is shining right in my eye.

11
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:18,240
- There's a lot of things going wrong today.

12
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:19,080
- Yeah. - Yeah.

13
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:19,920
- Yeah.

14
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:22,320
- This is a bad, this is gonna be a bad one, everybody.

15
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:24,880
- Yeah, this is gonna be really, really bad.

16
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:25,880
- This is gonna be a really bad one.

17
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:27,120
Maybe the worst ever.

18
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:29,000
- I tried to get something to eat on the way here.

19
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I tried to get a protein bar at CVS, didn't even scan.

20
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,120
The lady was like, "It's just not scanning."

21
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:38,720
- So you can't have it? - She's like, "You can't have it."

22
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:40,720
Like, you fucking, it's CVS.

23
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:42,040
- It's free if it doesn't scan.

24
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:43,280
- Get your shit together. - That's right.

25
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:44,440
It should be free if it doesn't scan.

26
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:45,640
- She tried to scan it with the gun,

27
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:47,600
tried to scan it at every register,

28
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:50,040
tried to scan it with her phone.

29
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:51,040
Well, that was the problem.

30
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:52,520
She shot a hole through it.

31
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:55,280
And I was like, "I don't want no hole in my damn Clif Bar."

32
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:57,280
- Yosemite Sam has fallen on hard times.

33
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:01,440
starting to work at CVS. I did get a varmint bar.

34
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:12,240
I was also just at CVS and I got my my COVID booster and my flu shot at the same time.

35
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:16,640
Well, that's what I'll say is like, yeah, I just got my COVID booster and I really have to say that

36
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:20,240
Microsoft devices be hitting different gifts this year.

37
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:24,000
What do you think of the Surface Pro?

38
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:30,740
I was just like yeah, I mean the thing about it is innovative and it's kind of like it's between a tablet and a laptop

39
00:01:30,740 --> 00:01:32,720
But just something you don't see so true

40
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:35,840
Yeah, and I mean I can't speak for everyone

41
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:40,400
But everyone in my family would be over the moon to see one of those under the tree this year

42
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:45,920
My question is just under the menorah does Microsoft likes both does it come in different colors? No

43
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:50,300
Really the screen stays black until you turn it on

44
00:01:53,260 --> 00:01:54,260
You know what I'm getting?

45
00:01:54,260 --> 00:01:55,260
That's a good point.

46
00:01:55,260 --> 00:01:56,260
I didn't think about that.

47
00:01:56,260 --> 00:01:58,940
You know what I'm getting my family this year?

48
00:01:58,940 --> 00:01:59,940
What?

49
00:01:59,940 --> 00:02:01,220
One year of Microsoft Office.

50
00:02:01,220 --> 00:02:02,860
Oh my gosh, that's another great gift.

51
00:02:02,860 --> 00:02:04,700
I mean, that's a gift that lasts a whole year.

52
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:05,700
Microsoft 365.

53
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:08,580
Microsoft Surface, you can only use it one time.

54
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:09,580
Unless you charge it.

55
00:02:09,580 --> 00:02:10,580
Damn.

56
00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:13,700
I tried to use my pen on it.

57
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:17,500
And it was actually, I used a Sharpie.

58
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:21,260
And I couldn't get that stuff off the screen.

59
00:02:21,260 --> 00:02:22,260
No.

60
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:26,020
great gift sharpies. I think I'm smelling.

61
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:29,700
Staples do be hitting different in the holidays season ever since.

62
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:32,060
They do be smelling amazing when you put them in your nose.

63
00:02:32,060 --> 00:02:36,260
Yup. And they color the inside of your nose a different color than it could be otherwise.

64
00:02:36,260 --> 00:02:40,220
Do you remember they used to have like scented markers and shit?

65
00:02:40,220 --> 00:02:42,300
I loved smelling those. Those are the best.

66
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:43,780
They smelled so good. Those are honestly some of the best smells.

67
00:02:43,780 --> 00:02:46,460
Have you ever smelled a vanilla marker? What?

68
00:02:46,460 --> 00:02:48,580
A vanilla scented marker? Yes dude.

69
00:02:48,580 --> 00:02:51,100
A scented marker? Have you ever smelled a vanilla one?

70
00:02:51,100 --> 00:02:55,020
There was a vanilla smelling one that smelled just like vanilla.

71
00:02:55,020 --> 00:02:56,860
Dude, the grape one?

72
00:02:56,860 --> 00:02:57,860
I'm not kidding.

73
00:02:57,860 --> 00:02:59,580
The grape one?

74
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:01,580
They had these little ones.

75
00:03:01,580 --> 00:03:09,020
These kids in my class in like fifth grade, they were like this big and there was like

76
00:03:09,020 --> 00:03:12,700
a vanilla one that someone had that looked like vanilla ice cream or something.

77
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:16,700
It was like supposed to, it had like a cone and you know what I mean?

78
00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:18,820
And it smelled just like vanilla.

79
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:23,500
I have a money scented incense that I'm afraid to burn.

80
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:24,500
Yeah?

81
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:27,540
I'm afraid that it's going to actually affect my life.

82
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:28,540
Probably is.

83
00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:31,020
Someone gave it to Janna for her birthday, so it was like a serious gift.

84
00:03:31,020 --> 00:03:33,100
It was like, "This is going to bring you money."

85
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:34,100
Yeah.

86
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:36,980
I don't know how much more money I can take that makes so damn much money.

87
00:03:36,980 --> 00:03:37,980
That's true.

88
00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:41,820
I haven't burned any incense in my life yet because I'm waiting for the best one.

89
00:03:41,820 --> 00:03:44,900
Someday they're going to have to, I mean, someday they're going to, you know, there's

90
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:47,340
incense that's like, "Oh, this one will bring you good luck.

91
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:48,340
This one will bring you money.

92
00:03:48,340 --> 00:03:51,900
I just want to bring you love. I mean, I feel like it's only a matter of time before they

93
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:53,700
design one that's just all this stuff.

94
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:54,700
Yeah.

95
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:55,700
Yeah.

96
00:03:55,700 --> 00:03:56,700
I would be--

97
00:03:56,700 --> 00:03:57,700
It still smells like everything.

98
00:03:57,700 --> 00:03:58,700
I'm worried about--

99
00:03:58,700 --> 00:03:59,700
But nothing at the same time.

100
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:03,700
--going to get some incense because I see one and I go, "Oh, lime incense. This is going

101
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:09,580
to be pretty good." Go home, light it. Oh, shit. Crime incense. I accidentally got the

102
00:04:09,580 --> 00:04:10,580
crime incense.

103
00:04:10,580 --> 00:04:11,580
Yeah.

104
00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:12,580
All of a sudden--

105
00:04:12,580 --> 00:04:14,940
The smell is a beacon for criminals. They smell it wafting out of your window.

106
00:04:14,940 --> 00:04:21,280
It's not like yeah money one you burn that money one a criminal smells that is gonna start climbing up your window. Yeah money

107
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:27,820
It's true a lot of ones that correct creme that could be yeah, they're gonna French for crime. Yeah, yeah

108
00:04:27,820 --> 00:04:32,860
Grime mm-hmm bobbery for apples

109
00:04:32,860 --> 00:04:38,480
Accidentally got robbery. Yeah, I could be products. I could be a my apple products. Yeah, yeah

110
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:44,220
Yeah, there's a lot of there's a lot of different instances that bring our city car Cinti

111
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:47,220
I accidentally got larceny.

112
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:48,220
Whoops.

113
00:04:48,220 --> 00:04:53,820
Yeah, ooh, this delicious melanie smelling incense is actually a felony.

114
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:56,220
Yeah, whoops, I brought a felony power to my house.

115
00:04:56,220 --> 00:04:57,220
Oh great, now I'm arrested.

116
00:04:57,220 --> 00:05:00,220
Great, I just got arrested because I lit the wrong incense.

117
00:05:00,220 --> 00:05:03,220
Burning a felony incense counts as committing a felony.

118
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:05,220
Yeah, if you burn it all the way down.

119
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:07,220
Well, it's because it's worth $500.

120
00:05:07,220 --> 00:05:08,220
Yeah.

121
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:10,220
So if you burn the stick, you're destroying the property.

122
00:05:10,220 --> 00:05:11,220
True, yeah.

123
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:14,820
I got a battery scented incense turns out is a different type of battery

124
00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:28,780
But no I got somebody came into my house beat the fuck out of me that taste when you put that 9-volt on your tongue

125
00:05:28,780 --> 00:05:33,680
Oh, it's impressed your brother. It's pretty good taste. Yeah. Yeah, I love the taste of you

126
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:39,900
Know when you leave a battery in the attic for a while and it makes white foam. Yeah. Mm-hmm. So cool. Yeah

127
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:43,340
I thought if I touched that stuff I would die.

128
00:05:43,340 --> 00:05:44,340
Would you die?

129
00:05:44,340 --> 00:05:47,740
I was so afraid of touching the white battery foam when I was a kid.

130
00:05:47,740 --> 00:05:48,740
Really?

131
00:05:48,740 --> 00:05:49,740
Yeah.

132
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:51,740
I would find, I would be like, "Oh, I forgot I had an RC car in the attic."

133
00:05:51,740 --> 00:05:56,100
And I'd pull it out and it made rabies out of the battery box.

134
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:57,100
I wasn't afraid.

135
00:05:57,100 --> 00:06:00,060
I would put that shit right in a plastic bag and put it outside.

136
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:03,300
How do you dispose, aren't you supposed to dispose of batteries a specific way?

137
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:04,780
You're supposed to recycle batteries.

138
00:06:04,780 --> 00:06:07,460
You're supposed to put them in the trash but in a plastic bag first.

139
00:06:07,460 --> 00:06:08,460
Really?

140
00:06:08,460 --> 00:06:10,460
That's how we did it in my household.

141
00:06:10,460 --> 00:06:11,460
That's sick.

142
00:06:11,460 --> 00:06:13,460
I usually just flush them down the toilet.

143
00:06:13,460 --> 00:06:14,460
Yeah.

144
00:06:14,460 --> 00:06:16,460
You're supposed to throw them out the window as far as you can.

145
00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:19,460
Get them as far away from you as possible.

146
00:06:19,460 --> 00:06:20,460
Yeah.

147
00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:23,460
I've never thought about the environmental damage a battery does.

148
00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:25,460
Yeah, because that's where lightning comes from.

149
00:06:25,460 --> 00:06:26,460
You just throw it away when you're done.

150
00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:27,460
True.

151
00:06:27,460 --> 00:06:30,460
Yeah, they say lightning actually comes from the ground to the clouds.

152
00:06:30,460 --> 00:06:31,460
That's because it comes from batteries.

153
00:06:31,460 --> 00:06:34,460
Do you remember the battery from Toy Story 2 in the beginning?

154
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:35,460
Yeah.

155
00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:37,460
I wanted to eat that thing so bad.

156
00:06:37,460 --> 00:06:38,300
- It looked delicious, man.

157
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:39,500
- It looked so good.

158
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:40,340
- Yeah.

159
00:06:40,340 --> 00:06:41,300
- I wanted to eat it.

160
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:42,980
- Oh my God, it's so special.

161
00:06:42,980 --> 00:06:45,460
- I would eat like a Halo Shield battery.

162
00:06:45,460 --> 00:06:46,300
- Oh yeah.

163
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:47,120
- Yeah.

164
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:47,960
- That'd be good.

165
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:48,860
- That'd be a good battery to eat.

166
00:06:48,860 --> 00:06:50,740
- I wanna eat one of the needles from the Needler.

167
00:06:50,740 --> 00:06:52,580
- Oh those would be so sour.

168
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:54,620
- You know that shit would be pink limited.

169
00:06:54,620 --> 00:06:55,460
- Yeah, sour rock candy.

170
00:06:55,460 --> 00:06:56,300
- Yeah, that's all my dope.

171
00:06:56,300 --> 00:06:57,660
- You know that shit would be pink limited.

172
00:06:57,660 --> 00:07:00,460
- What other ammo from video games would taste good?

173
00:07:00,460 --> 00:07:01,500
(laughing)

174
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:03,540
- I mean, any of the plasma grenade,

175
00:07:03,540 --> 00:07:05,060
putting that in your mouth.

176
00:07:05,060 --> 00:07:08,260
Blue plasma probably tastes so good that it's the best.

177
00:07:08,260 --> 00:07:12,260
- Though I bet like, I feel like a rocket,

178
00:07:12,260 --> 00:07:13,900
like rocket ammo from like Fortnite,

179
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:15,100
I feel like you could screw it open

180
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:16,620
and have some kind of really good powder.

181
00:07:16,620 --> 00:07:19,140
- All the Fortnite stuff looks like candy.

182
00:07:19,140 --> 00:07:20,740
- Yeah, not the ammo though.

183
00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:22,160
- Yeah, the ammo doesn't.

184
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:24,380
- Most of those look like bullets, except for the rockets.

185
00:07:24,380 --> 00:07:25,420
- It could be a damn cake.

186
00:07:25,420 --> 00:07:27,620
- Yeah, hey, the Fortnite shield potion.

187
00:07:27,620 --> 00:07:30,380
I would literally drink that every single day of my life.

188
00:07:30,380 --> 00:07:31,460
- I wish I could drink a choke jug.

189
00:07:31,460 --> 00:07:32,980
- I don't drink soda or energy drinks,

190
00:07:32,980 --> 00:07:33,820
but I would drink shield potion.

191
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:35,820
What's that soda slurp?

192
00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:37,820
Oh yeah, that's Chug.

193
00:07:37,820 --> 00:07:39,820
Chug.

194
00:07:39,820 --> 00:07:41,820
I think you're talking about the real life one.

195
00:07:41,820 --> 00:07:43,820
Surge.

196
00:07:43,820 --> 00:07:45,820
Which Surge looks like a battery.

197
00:07:45,820 --> 00:07:47,820
Yo, the Minecraft dirt block though.

198
00:07:47,820 --> 00:07:49,820
Oh, jeez.

199
00:07:49,820 --> 00:07:51,820
They should get Benjamin Babish on the Minecraft dirt block.

200
00:07:51,820 --> 00:07:53,820
He should be doing that crap.

201
00:07:53,820 --> 00:07:55,820
That might be busted.

202
00:07:55,820 --> 00:07:57,820
It might actually be really good, we don't know.

203
00:07:57,820 --> 00:07:59,820
Who knows, man.

204
00:07:59,820 --> 00:08:01,820
He wouldn't make it with real dirt, he'd make it with chocolate pudding and Oreo crumbs.

205
00:08:01,820 --> 00:08:03,660
- Man up and eat the dirt.

206
00:08:03,660 --> 00:08:04,500
- Make some real dirt.

207
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:05,660
- Just eat the dirt.

208
00:08:05,660 --> 00:08:07,580
- Yeah, a big dirt block in your house.

209
00:08:07,580 --> 00:08:08,420
- I'll do it myself.

210
00:08:08,420 --> 00:08:11,020
- Dude, I also, I feel like if you could cook

211
00:08:11,020 --> 00:08:12,700
a Koopa Troopa in its shell.

212
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:13,540
- Oh, man.

213
00:08:13,540 --> 00:08:14,780
- Oh, fucking wow.

214
00:08:14,780 --> 00:08:16,060
- The only problem would be the underwear,

215
00:08:16,060 --> 00:08:17,660
the boxer shorts.

216
00:08:17,660 --> 00:08:20,660
- That's just mo soup for me.

217
00:08:20,660 --> 00:08:22,420
- Koopa soupa?

218
00:08:22,420 --> 00:08:24,740
- Kinda wanna eat a turtle.

219
00:08:24,740 --> 00:08:25,580
- Yeah.

220
00:08:25,580 --> 00:08:26,400
- Never eaten a turtle?

221
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:28,580
- I saw a video.

222
00:08:28,580 --> 00:08:31,980
is a video of a turtle being prepared.

223
00:08:31,980 --> 00:08:33,620
- I saw a video of a turtle being prepared

224
00:08:33,620 --> 00:08:35,100
in Cannibal Holocaust.

225
00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:37,220
That made me unhappy to see.

226
00:08:37,220 --> 00:08:38,460
- Yeah, maybe I have to see that

227
00:08:38,460 --> 00:08:40,660
because they were putting like star anise

228
00:08:40,660 --> 00:08:41,860
and like chilies on it.

229
00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:42,740
- In Cannibal Holocaust,

230
00:08:42,740 --> 00:08:44,380
they just like crack the shell off it

231
00:08:44,380 --> 00:08:45,220
and it's disgusting and they wanna throw it.

232
00:08:45,220 --> 00:08:47,780
- The thing is about a turtle is that

233
00:08:47,780 --> 00:08:50,380
it made me less interested in eating them

234
00:08:50,380 --> 00:08:53,220
is that their shell is not like--

235
00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:54,060
- The shell is the body.

236
00:08:54,060 --> 00:08:55,940
- It's not like a rock they're stuck in.

237
00:08:55,940 --> 00:08:56,780
- Yeah, no, it's like they're a part of them.

238
00:08:56,780 --> 00:09:00,620
You think because you learn about hermit crabs in your kid, you think a turtle is the same

239
00:09:00,620 --> 00:09:01,620
situation.

240
00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:03,140
No, they can feel every time you touch a shell.

241
00:09:03,140 --> 00:09:04,140
Yeah.

242
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:05,140
So like, yeah.

243
00:09:05,140 --> 00:09:06,140
The nerve endings on a shell, that's crazy.

244
00:09:06,140 --> 00:09:11,420
Oh, dude, I bet they cum so hard when you touch the shell.

245
00:09:11,420 --> 00:09:12,420
I'd love to have a shell.

246
00:09:12,420 --> 00:09:14,460
It's like a hoof on top of them.

247
00:09:14,460 --> 00:09:15,460
I'd love to have a shell.

248
00:09:15,460 --> 00:09:16,460
It's like their foreskin.

249
00:09:16,460 --> 00:09:17,460
It's not like their foreskin.

250
00:09:17,460 --> 00:09:18,460
It's exactly like their foreskin.

251
00:09:18,460 --> 00:09:19,460
And then shave it off.

252
00:09:19,460 --> 00:09:20,460
They don't need it.

253
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:21,460
It's my uncut turtle.

254
00:09:21,460 --> 00:09:22,460
Yeah.

255
00:09:22,460 --> 00:09:24,720
(laughing)

256
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:27,760
- Yeah, I circumcise turtles for a living.

257
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:29,940
- I think scientists should stop trying to clone sheep

258
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:32,160
or clone mammoths or whatever and work on just like

259
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:34,440
genetically modifying a turtle with no shell.

260
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:36,360
'Cause I think that would be one of the best looking animals.

261
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:37,720
- There is a soft shell turtle.

262
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:39,760
- Not a soft shell, no shell.

263
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:41,360
- Yeah, it looks like it has no shell.

264
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:42,800
- I'm not talking about looks like it has no shell.

265
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:46,320
- Turtle arms, turtle legs, turtle head, man's white body.

266
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:47,720
(laughing)

267
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:48,720
That's what you want?

268
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:51,960
- I thought you were going with like a Rayman thing there.

269
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:57,000
it's like a turtle, pretty much all composed together except the arms are floating.

270
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:01,800
We don't know. I mean, there could be gravity involved.

271
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:07,480
That'd be so cool to have a floating limbs, like Plock or Rayman.

272
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:10,280
How scary is it to fight Rayman?

273
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:11,480
We don't know where that arm's going.

274
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:14,760
Exactly. And also, how can I even kill? Are you even killable?

275
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:21,880
I feel like if I walked between Rayman's arm and his hand and his body, I would get cancer.

276
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:26,920
and die. Definitely yeah. Your hand is already. He just has to move his hand next to you and

277
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:31,480
I think you would. Yeah. Yeah his hand around you. Yeah exactly. Like he throws his arm. Yeah

278
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:37,560
just he does a circle around. That's what, that's what, Ray is radioactive man. Yeah. Whoa. Whoa.

279
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:42,120
Whoa. We cracked the case. I may be, I may be just, that might be a. And the rabbits must have,

280
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:46,760
the rabbits have birth defects from the radiation. That's why they're like that. Oh my fucking god.

281
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:54,040
That's why they're so annoying. You're kind of like a real life rabbit. Yeah a little bit. How? Just I hate you

282
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:56,200
And you're white

283
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:58,520
You don't hate me. I'm not white you like this

284
00:10:58,520 --> 00:11:01,560
I don't have that my teeth are small

285
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:04,280
That's one of your defects

286
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:05,960
Yeah. Yeah

287
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:10,840
I didn't I didn't know I had your short until cameron called them small one time and I went home and I was really

288
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:14,900
Self-conscious holding up a vanity mirror

289
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:17,080
And I was like, "Yeah, I guess they are kind of small."

290
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:19,080
(laughter)

291
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:21,080
I always thought I had big teeth.

292
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:23,080
That's funny.

293
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:25,080
(laughter)

294
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:27,080
I didn't know that.

295
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:29,080
Yeah, I guess you do.

296
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:31,080
Somebody said I had a big nose the other day.

297
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:33,080
You don't have a big nose.

298
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:35,080
I don't have a big nose at all, but then I got self-conscious about it.

299
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:37,080
And then I started looking at my side profile and I was like, "No."

300
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:39,080
I think I don't even, I didn't even notice you had small teeth

301
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:41,080
until you showed me that picture of you as a kid

302
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:43,080
where your teeth are like dots.

303
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:44,080
Oh, yeah.

304
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:45,080
Yeah, you do.

305
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:48,240
Well, that's because I used to grind my teeth so much in my sleep that they like...

306
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:49,240
Your rice teeth.

307
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:50,640
Yeah, I shaved them down to like little rice...

308
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:52,680
Yeah, you got Bobby Peru teeth.

309
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:53,840
Who's that?

310
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:56,080
From that one movie.

311
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:57,080
What's the movie called?

312
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:58,080
Bobby Peru?

313
00:11:58,080 --> 00:11:59,080
What movie is that?

314
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:00,080
It's a David Lynch movie.

315
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:01,080
They're like fish teeth.

316
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:02,080
Yeah.

317
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:03,480
Yeah, they're like goose teeth.

318
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:04,480
The ones he has.

319
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:05,480
Yeah, the goose, exactly.

320
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:06,480
Yeah.

321
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:07,480
The little bumps.

322
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:08,480
I don't have fish teeth.

323
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:09,480
You used to, I'm saying.

324
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:10,480
Oh.

325
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:11,480
Now you have big fish teeth.

326
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:12,480
Yeah.

327
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:16,560
teeth are kind of, I mean, you know. I wish I had shark teeth. I have some British in me.

328
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:23,040
I don't have to, I don't have to get into that. Yeah, you want some? I already have it. I don't

329
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:27,760
need any more. Yeah, you want a little. I wish I could expunge all of it. Do you have a little

330
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:33,360
wild at heart? Oh, okay. Willem Dafoe. Oh, I did have little Bobby Peru teeth. Yeah. Yeah.

331
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:38,720
Yeah, when I was like six years old, I had Bobby Peru teeth. Yeah. But my gums were normal.

332
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:40,440
They didn't look like that.

333
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:41,440
I don't know.

334
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:42,440
I don't know.

335
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:43,440
I don't know.

336
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:44,720
Let's go to the fact checker.

337
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:47,360
I think you might have done what Bobby Perut did in that movie.

338
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:50,160
Fact checker just saying no.

339
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:51,480
Fact checker just saying you're lying.

340
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:53,000
There's some kind of gum disease.

341
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Periodontitis.

342
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
I'm glad we hired a fact checker.

343
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,320
Yeah, it's great to have.

344
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:57,320
Yeah.

345
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:58,320
Yeah.

346
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:00,200
You got us all hooked up to a lie detector.

347
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:03,400
Well we don't bother using him anymore for the rest of the episode though.

348
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:04,400
Yeah.

349
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:05,400
Just that.

350
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:06,400
Yeah.

351
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:07,400
So if you loved that, sorry.

352
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:09,080
If you loved that incredible.

353
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:11,680
We're not making it into a bit.

354
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:13,680
It's not going to happen for 10 minutes.

355
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:14,680
No sir.

356
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:15,680
Nope.

357
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:16,680
Right fact checker?

358
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:17,680
Silence.

359
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:18,680
Yep.

360
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:19,680
He's died.

361
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:20,680
He died right now.

362
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:21,680
He passed away.

363
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:22,680
He's already decomposing.

364
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:25,840
It's like that video of that fox.

365
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:29,600
He swelled up and then he burst with maggots.

366
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:32,000
Things are just eating him off of the forest floor.

367
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,440
We're in the forest.

368
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:38,480
Speaking of maggots, have you ever seen those videos of people and they get maggots in them?

369
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:39,480
Oh yeah.

370
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:40,480
What's that called?

371
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:42,480
And they pop the maggots out like it's a big zit.

372
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:44,480
But then you see it start like moving.

373
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:48,080
The ones, they just have like big holes on their body.

374
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:49,080
Yep.

375
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:50,080
That's so cool, man.

376
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:52,360
I saw a video of like a stray dog in a...

377
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:56,840
And the guy that they're removing them from is always just like, just sitting there.

378
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:59,280
Like there's just maggots coming out of his head.

379
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:00,280
Yeah.

380
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:02,960
That the guy is taking out with a scalpel and he's just like kind of smiling.

381
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:03,960
I feel like if...

382
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:04,960
Well, it's probably...

383
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:07,720
I would be kind of smiling if the maggots were being removed.

384
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:10,220
first. Well, I would just be finally. That's probably the first good day of his life. I'd

385
00:14:10,220 --> 00:14:15,000
probably be walking around. That's probably like the best day he's ever lived. His best

386
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:19,320
day still ends up with like a bunch of fucking holes in the back of his head. Yeah. That's

387
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:23,040
sucks. At least the maggots blocked the holes from the elements. That's true. Because they

388
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:26,880
like, you know, these people live in. The elements do be trying to get into the holes

389
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:29,680
in his head. And these are the kind of people who get maggots in their head, they live in

390
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:34,120
the elements. Yeah, the elemental plane. Yeah. They live in the element store in Universal

391
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:39,880
exactly yeah they sell you surfboards and shit yeah oh don't mind my head oh yeah don't mind

392
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:46,840
this big one giant maggot out the top what are they called something bug bugs maggot

393
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:52,240
heads but what are you asking there's a word for the there is a word for when you have

394
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:58,560
maggots in you it starts with an m i'm pretty sure yeah maggot maggot in flesh word oh it's

395
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:00,560
It's myiasis.

396
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:01,560
M-Y-I-A-S-I-S.

397
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:02,560
That's what it is.

398
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:03,560
Myiasis.

399
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:04,560
Stinky.

400
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:05,560
That's right.

401
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:06,560
That's true.

402
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:07,560
Yup.

403
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:08,560
Yup.

404
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:09,560
Yes, sir.

405
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:12,080
Imagine how much more beautiful the rest of your body looks when your head has maggots

406
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:13,080
in it.

407
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:14,080
Yeah.

408
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:15,080
Yeah.

409
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:16,080
You could probably seduce so many women.

410
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:17,080
Yeah.

411
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:18,080
Yeah.

412
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:19,080
Dude, like the...

413
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:22,640
I saw a video of a stray dog at the vet and they're like popping the maggots out of the

414
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:25,600
dog like it's a zit.

415
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:26,600
Fuck that, bro.

416
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:27,600
Yeah.

417
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:31,260
I gotta stop looking up weird shit.

418
00:15:31,260 --> 00:15:35,660
You always will be hanging out and you'll be like and you'll just suddenly look at your

419
00:15:35,660 --> 00:15:39,140
phone and instantly just go "Ugh!" and I'll be like "What's wrong Patrick?" and you're

420
00:15:39,140 --> 00:15:41,340
like "I just saw a guy made into a sandwich."

421
00:15:41,340 --> 00:15:47,780
Yeah and we're like "Oh was it like a surprise video?" and you're like "No it was called

422
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:50,420
'Guy Made Into Sandwich' and I clicked on it."

423
00:15:50,420 --> 00:15:56,500
Yeah, I don't know I'm in like fucking some group chat where they send gross shit.

424
00:15:56,500 --> 00:16:01,500
There was like Rex last night in the car was just watching that video. Those guys got shot a million times.

425
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:03,500
He was like, "Oh my god! Oh god!"

426
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:05,500
He just stalled it over.

427
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:09,500
And then there was like a long pause and you could hear him just start the video over to watch it again.

428
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:10,500
That's so funny.

429
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:12,500
I was like, "What is wrong with you, man?"

430
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:13,500
Well, that's the thing.

431
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:14,500
He's darkly twisted.

432
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:24,500
Trainwreck stuff like that, like, I think I look at it just so it's like, you know, it doesn't,

433
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:28,900
Not so it desensitizes me, but it just keeps me grounded.

434
00:16:28,900 --> 00:16:29,900
You know what I mean?

435
00:16:29,900 --> 00:16:30,900
What?

436
00:16:30,900 --> 00:16:34,500
Like, looking at crazy shit, I feel like it keeps you...

437
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:36,900
You're getting a little too big for your britches, you think?

438
00:16:36,900 --> 00:16:39,300
And you gotta watch how the fucking ice is going to cavitate on there.

439
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:42,300
Well, that's why I eat rotten dookie once a month, because it's like...

440
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:43,300
Rotten dookie.

441
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:45,300
Yeah, well, because it's like, you know, like...

442
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:46,300
How does it look?

443
00:16:46,300 --> 00:16:47,300
You gotta make a difference.

444
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:48,500
It's actually way different from fresh.

445
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:50,500
I immediately knew as you...

446
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:53,500
On the walk over here, I saw some rotten dookie that had been sitting there so long

447
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:58,060
long that it developed a skin. Yeah, it looked like a brown banana. I remember

448
00:16:58,060 --> 00:17:02,900
back in our apartment in Boston on from the walk from the apartment to the car

449
00:17:02,900 --> 00:17:07,380
there was like human shit that was literally there for like more than a

450
00:17:07,380 --> 00:17:12,740
month and there was a rainstorm and it did not wash away. Whoa. It was literally

451
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:19,300
like a pile of shit so big and so so I saw that in a parking garage in LA. Yeah. Yeah, I was like skating around.

452
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:22,300
We saw some human shit on the boardwalk last night.

453
00:17:22,300 --> 00:17:23,300
Did we?

454
00:17:23,300 --> 00:17:24,300
Yeah, maybe you didn't.

455
00:17:24,300 --> 00:17:25,300
I didn't.

456
00:17:25,300 --> 00:17:26,300
You left it.

457
00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:31,300
He dropped out of his pants and he just kept going.

458
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:32,300
Whoa, what's that?

459
00:17:32,300 --> 00:17:33,300
That's crazy.

460
00:17:33,300 --> 00:17:34,300
I didn't see that.

461
00:17:34,300 --> 00:17:35,300
Yeah.

462
00:17:35,300 --> 00:17:38,700
I'm still kind of bummed that the Rainforest Cafe didn't let us in.

463
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:39,700
Yeah, that was fucked.

464
00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:41,140
It would have just been a long wait.

465
00:17:41,140 --> 00:17:42,140
Fuck that, man.

466
00:17:42,140 --> 00:17:43,140
I've never been, but it was.

467
00:17:43,140 --> 00:17:45,020
I truly didn't know there were any still open, though.

468
00:17:45,020 --> 00:17:46,020
I know.

469
00:17:46,020 --> 00:17:47,020
That's why I got so excited.

470
00:17:47,020 --> 00:17:48,020
I was excited, too.

471
00:17:48,020 --> 00:17:49,680
- If we go to AC, we definitely gotta get a reservation.

472
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:50,520
- We'll make a reservation.

473
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:52,180
- We'll make a reservation for the Reinforce Cafe.

474
00:17:52,180 --> 00:17:53,020
- Oh, dude.

475
00:17:53,020 --> 00:17:54,860
- 'Cause like, out of nowhere, there'll be like,

476
00:17:54,860 --> 00:17:56,480
thunder and shit, and then you'll hear like,

477
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:57,520
gorilla sounds while you're eating.

478
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:58,360
- Really?

479
00:17:58,360 --> 00:17:59,180
- Yeah.

480
00:17:59,180 --> 00:18:00,020
- That's the best.

481
00:18:00,020 --> 00:18:00,860
- That would scare me.

482
00:18:00,860 --> 00:18:01,680
- Yeah.

483
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:02,880
Oh, we gotta go.

484
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:04,680
- Yeah, we can go next week.

485
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:06,860
- Dude, that'd be awesome.

486
00:18:06,860 --> 00:18:07,920
- I feel terrible today.

487
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:10,180
I just didn't even drink anything.

488
00:18:10,180 --> 00:18:11,020
I just had that gambling hangover.

489
00:18:11,020 --> 00:18:12,060
- I feel horrible.

490
00:18:12,060 --> 00:18:16,680
- I got home and forgot that drunk me, two nights ago,

491
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:19,000
I bought a 4 Loko Gold.

492
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,880
Don't tell me you drank that at 2 in the morning last night.

493
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:23,880
I drank a 4 Loko Gold at 11 when I got home.

494
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:26,640
What the fuck is wrong with you man?

495
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:29,720
I don't know.

496
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:31,480
What's the gold version mean?

497
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:33,320
14% ABV.

498
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:34,320
Wow.

499
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:36,160
And how much caffeine is in that?

500
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:37,160
None.

501
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:38,160
There's no more caffeine in 4 Loko.

502
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:39,160
Oh really?

503
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:40,160
Yeah.

504
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:41,160
I've never had one.

505
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:42,160
Me neither.

506
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:43,160
You haven't?

507
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:44,160
No.

508
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:45,160
There was a period in my life where I was just drinking 4 Loko's.

509
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:46,160
Yo, you gotta.

510
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:50,220
It's not it's like more expenses in a tall boy. No, it's the same price as a tall boy

511
00:18:50,220 --> 00:18:52,480
Really and it's taller than most tall boys

512
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:59,840
How tall in feet probably it's probably 25 ounces. It's like a foot tall. It's like the same as a natty daddy

513
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:06,000
Though that's if you drink this shit natty daddies is a problem. Yeah, dude. There was a guy at the world

514
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,600
It was fun. There's a guy at the liquor store who would come in

515
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:12,880
pretty much every day and he would get he would

516
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:19,400
you would get like six Natty Daddies and

517
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:20,400
Tall Pans?

518
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:23,000
Yeah and you would get like

519
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,000
Yeah Natty Daddies are a boy

520
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:29,720
I think it was like two like blueberry Smirnoff nips and then a pack of

521
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:35,000
Parlaments, Parlaments of the hundreds and he would come in and he would

522
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:38,840
never order, he would come in and you just get that stuff for him and he

523
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:41,360
would always be like, "Oh yeah, you have to remember my order because it's all

524
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:42,360
blue."

525
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:44,620
(laughing)

526
00:19:44,620 --> 00:19:46,100
- The blue man.

527
00:19:46,100 --> 00:19:47,600
Was he blue?

528
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:50,660
That's how you prep for the blue man group.

529
00:19:50,660 --> 00:19:51,800
(laughing)

530
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:54,360
- Yeah, that's the hazing in the blue man group.

531
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:57,600
- Yeah, they got me drinking all these blue drinks.

532
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:59,400
- Are they allowed to talk to each other, you think?

533
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:00,300
- No.

534
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:01,500
- They don't know each other.

535
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:03,200
They don't know who each other are.

536
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:04,040
- True.

537
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:05,020
- Yeah.

538
00:20:05,020 --> 00:20:06,360
- Yeah, 'cause they're blue.

539
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:07,200
- Yeah, I'm sure.

540
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:08,600
- You can't recognize a blue man.

541
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:10,360
- They don't know each other off stage.

542
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:12,360
Do you think they have hair?

543
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:13,780
No. Those are bald caps?

544
00:20:13,780 --> 00:20:19,920
They have secret identities though. They do. Superman, Batman, Green Lantern.

545
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:25,320
They just gotta let out some steam every once in a while. How do you think that started the Blue Man Group?

546
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:28,200
Probably a lot of gay sex.

547
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:31,680
Probably a lot of sex between a bunch of guys together.

548
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:36,960
I just can't imagine like... Yeah, the idea process is very...

549
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:38,960
It's hard to follow that train of thought.

550
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:42,960
It seems very simple, but also there's probably some really complex reason as to why.

551
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:46,960
I don't think it seems that simple. I think it's a very weird combination.

552
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:48,960
We're going to be blue, not talk, and drum.

553
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:51,960
Well, which order do you think they came in?

554
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:57,960
I think it was probably drumming, and then they were like, "We need a twist on this. What if we were all blue?"

555
00:20:57,960 --> 00:20:59,960
And we can't talk.

556
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:02,960
Well, they just hate each other. That wasn't even a rule.

557
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:04,960
The Beatles didn't talk much either.

558
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:12,240
yeah that whole that new Peter Jackson 40 40 minutes of silence mm-hmm 40 hours of

559
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:17,600
silence 4,000 hours of silence actually that's why that's what I wish would come

560
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:21,880
out from the Beatles oh my god yes hey Beatles you're on notice that's right

561
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:26,160
yeah you know I were coming for the rest of you you know what my main experience

562
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:30,120
with the Beatles is what is the Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band movie

563
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:36,480
with the Bee Gees in it. Alice Cooper sings "Because". I liked that. I thought that movie was sick.

564
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:41,400
I liked the Help movie. Oh, the Help movie's fun. Yeah. Hard Day's Night also very fun.

565
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:48,920
The one with the Dookie Pie? I don't remember. The Help? No. The Dookie Pie movie?

566
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:52,880
Help, the Beatles movie. Oh, I don't know that. I was like, I don't think the Beatles were in the Help.

567
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:59,760
I'm sure they were listening to them. True. They were listening to the

568
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:08,940
Beatles every day on that set. Yeah. But yeah the Sgt. Pepper's movie. Steve

569
00:22:08,940 --> 00:22:13,240
Martin sings Maxwell's Silver Hammer. That's a fun one. It's a cool movie, dude.

570
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:16,120
Yeah. The Beatles movies are all pretty cool.

571
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:19,840
What movies? The Beatles movies are all pretty cool. Yeah.

572
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:24,960
Apparently everyone hated the Sgt. Pepper's movie.

573
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:29,720
Yeah. Yeah. Which I was like dude it was sick when I was fucking 12. I'm sure

574
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:34,380
on a rewatch you'd understand why yeah probably yeah yeah is there nudity in it

575
00:22:34,380 --> 00:22:41,280
no yeah literally no good yeah it's a Frampton's beautiful body oh he is good

576
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:46,280
looking he in that movie yeah nice looking good and all the BG's - don't

577
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:54,400
even see one dong from the BG's no don't even see Robins Gibb come on now come on

578
00:22:54,400 --> 00:23:04,360
Come on. Down low. Down low. What? Down low. Down low. Oh, okay. I just forgot. You forgot

579
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:07,800
to put your hand up. You said down low without holding your hand. I forgot that you have

580
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:12,360
to do that. I thought you could just say down low and something's cool. Yeah. Up top, down

581
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:18,240
low, too slow. Hey, high five. In the middle. Say that. High five. Don't touch my pickle.

582
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:23,080
You got really close to the pickle right there. I did. I did almost get some pickle there.

583
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:26,080
Yeah, remember it was kind of strange.

584
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:28,760
Oh no, wait, you guys weren't with me.

585
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:29,760
When you touched a pickle?

586
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:35,640
No, I went to this diner, the place that I found the Hamburger Delight, and I ordered

587
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:38,920
a sandwich because I thought like, "Oh, it's going to come with fries, coleslaw, and a

588
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:39,920
pickle."

589
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:48,480
First of all, they didn't even put any tzatziki on the gyro, which is fucked up.

590
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:49,480
That's fucked up.

591
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:55,800
to put like if I'm getting a gyro, it's got to be like two globs of tzatziki on that thing.

592
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:56,800
Globs.

593
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:57,800
Globs, yeah.

594
00:23:57,800 --> 00:23:58,800
Globs.

595
00:23:58,800 --> 00:23:59,800
A glob I feel like is not very big.

596
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:00,800
No.

597
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:01,800
In terms of a sauce.

598
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:02,800
No, that's the perfect amount in a gyro.

599
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:03,800
In terms of a sauce.

600
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:04,800
In a sauce.

601
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:07,120
You also can't glob every sauce.

602
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:08,120
But a tzatziki.

603
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:09,120
Tzatziki you can glob.

604
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:10,120
That's a globby sauce.

605
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:12,320
But like a chipotle mayo can't be globbed.

606
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:13,320
No, no, no, no.

607
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:14,320
No, it's too runny.

608
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:18,120
- Mm-hmm, but yeah, I didn't even get the coleslaw

609
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:21,200
or the pickle with that, and there was not even,

610
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:23,560
there were no tzatziki on the gyro.

611
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:27,680
And I forget what this diner's called, but steer clear.

612
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:29,280
- Yeah, stay away from diners.

613
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:31,560
- Was that literally the whole story?

614
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:32,640
- Yes.

615
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:34,940
- And you, not only did you bring it up,

616
00:24:34,940 --> 00:24:38,120
but you were like, oh, you guys weren't with me.

617
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:39,320
- Yeah.

618
00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:42,360
- Like, we would've remembered that if we were with you?

619
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:45,080
I would have complained about not getting a pickle, yes.

620
00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:46,760
Well, 'cause a diner pickle's fuckin' awesome.

621
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:49,000
Just ask for the pickle, you fuckin' weirdo.

622
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,120
No, it said it, it was on the menu,

623
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:52,320
it said it comes with a pickle.

624
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:54,240
Yes, it said, "I didn't get my coleslaw

625
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:56,480
"and I didn't get my pickle."

626
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:57,320
Not gonna do that.

627
00:24:57,320 --> 00:24:58,140
Why?

628
00:24:58,140 --> 00:24:58,980
Why not?

629
00:24:58,980 --> 00:25:00,000
'Cause it seems rude.

630
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,080
You think it's rude to not give you a pickle?

631
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:02,900
That's true.

632
00:25:02,900 --> 00:25:03,740
I think honestly, wait staff--

633
00:25:03,740 --> 00:25:06,960
You literally let them bend you over and fuck you.

634
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:10,680
Nobody is more predatory than people

635
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:11,640
in the service industry.

636
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:15,740
Yeah, they're literally to take advantage of you literally at every single every

637
00:25:15,740 --> 00:25:19,240
opportunity because they literally all they're doing while they're like I need

638
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:23,340
to get home and I need to do drugs. Yeah, or I need to get back in the back and I

639
00:25:23,340 --> 00:25:27,200
know I need to die so soon. Oh, I need to go home and die in my bathroom. I have

640
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:30,520
to go home and kill myself. I need to make sure that this shift gets over soon

641
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:35,220
so I can go home and kill myself. Shut up. Give me my pickle. I need to exploit

642
00:25:35,220 --> 00:25:40,320
as many people as possible today. That's what they say. Oh yeah, diner pickle

643
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:41,320
That's good.

644
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:43,640
You want to get this pickle on the side of the sandwich?

645
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:44,640
You shouldn't feel bad telling me these.

646
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:46,040
One pickle next to the sandwich?

647
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:48,320
If you're a waiter or a waitress, you're like...

648
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:49,320
It's that half pickle.

649
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:52,480
Literally, I'm not even kidding, you're like subhuman to me.

650
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:54,520
You're like complete dirt.

651
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:55,520
Why?

652
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:56,520
Why not?

653
00:25:56,520 --> 00:25:57,520
Why?

654
00:25:57,520 --> 00:25:58,520
Why not say that?

655
00:25:58,520 --> 00:25:59,520
I don't know.

656
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:00,520
Why are you...

657
00:26:00,520 --> 00:26:01,520
Is my mommy's one?

658
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:02,520
Yeah, case and point.

659
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:03,520
Because you're talking about my mommy?

660
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:04,520
Case and point.

661
00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:05,520
Yeah.

662
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:06,520
That's messed up.

663
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:07,520
You don't talk about my mommy like that.

664
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:08,520
Your mommy is...

665
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:09,520
She subs on my human.

666
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:11,780
(laughing)

667
00:26:11,780 --> 00:26:12,620
- Nope.

668
00:26:12,620 --> 00:26:14,680
Nope.

669
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:16,280
- Yeah, I showed her my human sub.

670
00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:18,540
(laughing)

671
00:26:18,540 --> 00:26:21,960
- Speaking of diners too.

672
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:23,240
- She served me, no wait.

673
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:25,640
- 50's diner, nuh-uh.

674
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:28,400
- She let me have breakfast all day.

675
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:30,400
- Yeah, I dined on her 50.

676
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:31,560
Doesn't make any sense.

677
00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:32,800
(laughing)

678
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:34,160
- I hate 50's themed diners.

679
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:36,560
- Yeah, I got in a race car booth.

680
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:38,280
- Unless it has a race car booth.

00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:11,080
- Yeah, but you look in there and you see that it's got

688
00:27:11,080 --> 00:27:11,920
like cardboard, so you don't walk in.

689
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:13,240
- I do, every time I walk by there,

690
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:15,880
I feel like an orphan walking by a Christmas store.

691
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:17,640
(laughing)

692
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:19,200
I want it so bad. - In the cold.

693
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:21,480
- Dude, it's just pictures of Denzel Washington

694
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:22,720
on the wall, and Mike Myers.

695
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:25,720
- I feel like there's a very little difference

696
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:28,920
between seeing it and being inside of it eating.

697
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:29,760
- Being inside of it is so depressing.

698
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:31,320
- But then if I go inside, I have to eat Burger King.

699
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:32,520
- It's awesome.

700
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:33,800
- And I gotta deal with, like I said,

701
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:36,160
those pieces of shit who work there.

702
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:36,940

Yeah, I accidentally robbed a homeless man. He robbed him blind. He really stole what?

712
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:11,480
I thought he was giving me a nice gift because it was Christmas and he was in the giving spirit

715
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:28,440
I like to give people something in return. I didn't hear that. So if you could spare any money here's a

716
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:34,160
through a megaphone yeah yeah and Patrick said sorry I don't have any

717
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:38,520

722
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:13,640
That's so sick. A person with closed captions. That's so fucking sick. That'd be so... They

00:29:47,180 --> 00:29:51,380
Just put a visor on.

733
00:29:51,380 --> 00:29:52,660
You had a hat on earlier.

734
00:29:52,660 --> 00:29:54,940
You can't put a hat over his headphones.

735
00:29:54,940 --> 00:29:55,940
That's true.

736
00:29:55,940 --> 00:29:56,940
You can put it under the headphones.

737
00:29:56,940 --> 00:29:57,940
I'm thieved up.

738
00:29:57,940 --> 00:29:58,940

00:29:58,940 --> 00:30:03,660
Dude, I hope the, I wonder if the booster is going to be as bad as the second shot.

740
00:30:03,660 --> 00:30:05,860
I got a booster and flu shot at the same time.

741
00:30:05,860 --> 00:30:06,860
Oh, god.

00:30:12,380 --> 00:30:15,180

749
00:30:19,180 --> 00:30:20,180
The human computer this guy.

00:30:20,180 --> 00:30:22,500
That's what we call him.

751
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:24,500
Because I look up porn on him.

752
00:30:24,500 --> 00:30:26,540
I can google search anything in my mind.

753
00:30:26,540 --> 00:30:27,540
Okay.

Nice.

761
00:30:37,700 --> 00:30:44,700
August Ames, date of death.

00:30:44,700 --> 00:30:48,700
Wow, this is interesting.

763
00:30:48,700 --> 00:30:51,100
3564 AD.

00:30:51,100 --> 00:30:53,420
I knew they were lying.

765
00:30:53,420 --> 00:30:56,700
I knew they were fucking lying, dude.

766
00:30:56,700 --> 00:30:59,300
That was a heartbreaker.

767
00:30:59,300 --> 00:31:08,580
I think Ben told me, he had a co-worker that was like, he was like, "Hey man, how you doing?"

768
00:31:08,580 --> 00:31:09,680
He's like, "Oh, not too good.

769
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:11,180
My favorite porn star just died."

770
00:31:11,180 --> 00:31:12,180

Get this

802
00:33:10,020 --> 00:33:15,260
Die hard not a Christmas movie really I think it is my friend. I think it's kind of the only

803
00:33:15,260 --> 00:33:17,780
You just said it was a fact that it wasn't prove it

804
00:33:17,780 --> 00:33:24,540
No takes place on Halloween. That's can't be true. It's true. If you look at the behind-the-scenes photo

805
00:33:24,540 --> 00:33:27,000
It's actually a Halloween party where everyone was weren't dressed as

806
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,820
Santa Christmas party

807
00:33:30,300 --> 00:33:34,460
Exactly Santa was a Halloween costume. Oh, dude. I didn't even think about

808
00:33:34,460 --> 00:33:40,140
That we're gonna be seeing that this month what Santa bar crawl Santa con?

809
00:33:40,140 --> 00:33:47,060
Yeah, I think Santa comes probably this weekend actually. Oh fuck me dude. I'm afraid of Santa Santa con sucks

810
00:33:47,060 --> 00:33:51,660
Santa con is not he's not gonna come to fucking Brooklyn Santa cons like a Manhattan thing

811
00:33:51,660 --> 00:33:55,100
I don't want to see him. You don't have to see Santa if you don't want to

812
00:33:55,100 --> 00:33:58,500
What is your deal? Why are you afraid of Santa Claus?

813
00:33:58,500 --> 00:34:02,180
I sat down on his lap as a kid and he said, "Shut up."

814
00:34:02,180 --> 00:34:03,180
He said shut up?

815
00:34:03,180 --> 00:34:04,180
He said shut up.

816
00:34:04,180 --> 00:34:06,100
What did you say when he said shut up before?

817
00:34:06,100 --> 00:34:07,620
What made him say shut up to you?

818
00:34:07,620 --> 00:34:09,900
I was crying because I had to sit on his lap.

819
00:34:09,900 --> 00:34:10,900
Yeah.

820
00:34:10,900 --> 00:34:15,220
If I was Santa Claus and your mom handed me fucking you as a six year old, I would have

821
00:34:15,220 --> 00:34:16,220
punted you like a football.

822
00:34:16,220 --> 00:34:22,220
I feel like small Santas should be allowed to hit kids and like the parents aren't allowed

823
00:34:22,220 --> 00:34:25,100
to but the mall Santa once a year.

824
00:34:25,100 --> 00:34:26,100
It's like a sorting hat.

825
00:34:26,100 --> 00:34:29,540
Well, yeah, if the kid mall Santa's to get hit. Yeah, exactly

826
00:34:29,540 --> 00:34:33,580
It's like if your kid if yeah, your kid has that you like goes up to mall Santa

827
00:34:33,580 --> 00:34:36,780
It's like I want I want a fortnight gift card

828
00:34:36,780 --> 00:34:44,500
Yeah, no, no more video game if Santa can you see it's like like you get a bunch of empaths to be mall Santas

829
00:34:44,500 --> 00:34:49,780
So they can tell when the parents are annoyed with the kids. I think you should get a bunch of a paths

830
00:34:49,780 --> 00:34:55,340
Yeah, hey, who'd want to destroy the kid? What's an a path just die?

831
00:34:55,340 --> 00:35:01,500
hate. Psychopath. An antipath. An antipath. I'm one of those. Yeah me too I hate

832
00:35:01,500 --> 00:35:08,460
everything. I use psionic energy to attack people. Here, tell me something about your life Pat.

833
00:35:08,460 --> 00:35:14,660
My best friend is Caleb. I don't care. Wait it is? Maybe I'm not an antipath.

834
00:35:14,660 --> 00:35:20,960
Mm-hmm. Maybe I'm pathing. Yeah. Yeah. There's a pretty good picture of me and my

835
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:28,880
family with a mall Santa. It's like a Polaroid. It's cool. My... There's a pretty

836
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:32,080
good picture of me and your family. No, actually there is a pretty nice picture

837
00:35:32,080 --> 00:35:35,360
of you meeting my mom and dad for the first time. Yeah, it's in the MoMA.

838
00:35:35,360 --> 00:35:40,400
The title is The Aristocrats. But it's my little brother's crying. I have my fists

839
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:45,000
up like I'm about to fight Santa. My brother's yawning and like my sister's

840
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:50,360
just like not looking in the picture. So if you, you know, if you were that mall

841
00:35:50,360 --> 00:35:55,980
Santa I can really say it in my head I completely agree with you yeah the Santa

842
00:35:55,980 --> 00:35:58,920
should have hit me that's gonna be a bad job I wonder if you get paid well that's

843
00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:05,080
probably that's one of the closest jobs to slavery yeah it's being a mall Santa

844
00:36:05,080 --> 00:36:11,920
absolutely as you also can literally only do it if you're like a yeah I wonder

845
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:17,000
if anybody's ever like kind of 80% there and they're like well I need a job I got

846
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:22,200
time to go time to go fucking Christian Bale and prepare for the role, you know, eating

847
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:26,800
doughnuts and girl. Yeah, who wants to be a mall Santa? I think it's something I think

848
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:32,680
it's something you fall into one day. Yeah, you wake up after like a bender. The eight

849
00:36:32,680 --> 00:36:36,120
ball bag is like on your forehead and you look in the mirror and you're like fuck I

850
00:36:36,120 --> 00:36:40,240
look like exactly. Yeah, I have to fuck I need to just unemployment check. Last night

851
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:46,480
was so crazy. I turned into Santa. Yeah, exactly. I feel like it's like the squid game where

852
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:50,440
where they scout you, they pull you into a world,

853
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:52,080
an underworld of intrigue.

854
00:36:52,080 --> 00:36:53,320
- I feel like when you're old,

855
00:36:53,320 --> 00:36:55,000
you'll have a Santa thing going on.

856
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:55,840
- Me? - Yeah.

857
00:36:55,840 --> 00:36:58,260
- 'Cause you'll keep your hair and you're tall.

858
00:36:58,260 --> 00:36:59,960
And I feel like you might be able to get real fat

859
00:36:59,960 --> 00:37:00,800
if you want to.

860
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:03,000
- I could probably get fat if I wanted to.

861
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:04,720
- We're gonna stuff you.

862
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:05,600
- Don't stuff me.

863
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:08,440
- We're gonna stuff you like a turkey.

864
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:11,440
- I think that I wouldn't want to be Santa.

865
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:12,720
- We're gonna be feeding you nothing but gravy

866
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:13,560
for the rest of your days.

867
00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:20,560
is

868
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:23,960
was thinking of the real center of the world or

869
00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:26,080
the couple

870
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:28,160
like i was really a lie

871
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:31,560
yeah you know it's gonna hit me like over the course of this but it's really

872
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:34,240
kind of waves like i am here

873
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:36,360
i'm sweating

874
00:37:36,360 --> 00:37:38,240
i'm saying it

875
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:40,240
He's sticking right now?

876
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:42,240
I'm sticking right now!

877
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:44,240
I'm sticking right now!

878
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:46,240
I'm sticking right now!

879
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:48,240
He starts like singing.

880
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:50,240
That's such a great video.

881
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:52,240
Another episode where we talk about a video we saw.

882
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:54,240
Just a guy freaking out.

883
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:56,240
People like that.

884
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:58,240
People like to find the videos.

885
00:37:58,240 --> 00:38:00,240
People like talking about videos.

886
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:02,240
You know what I learned recently is people don't

887
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:04,240
just sit around and watch YouTube videos with their friends.

888
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:06,240
I think that's just an us thing I've learned.

889
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:10,400
I've learned. Maybe we just have weird some of the top curators. I don't think that's

890
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:13,600
true. I think a lot of people watch YouTube. I think that's really common. I think you

891
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:18,360
probably met one person who said that was weird. Yeah, yeah. That's probably. My friend

892
00:38:18,360 --> 00:38:23,280
group's like we're low-key like weird. We watch videos together. Yeah, yeah. We like

893
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:28,120
like YouTube. Sorry, yeah. We watch a daily dose of internet on the couch together. Who

894
00:38:28,120 --> 00:38:35,120
cares? Yeah, we do. I'll fuck. I love that kid. This is a dog that has a scarecrow. I

895
00:38:35,120 --> 00:38:37,120
that has a skateboard.

896
00:38:37,120 --> 00:38:38,120
Yeah.

897
00:38:38,120 --> 00:38:39,120
Yeah.

898
00:38:39,120 --> 00:38:44,000
I wish Daily Dose of Internet would have a daily overdose of internet.

899
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:45,000
I hope that guy dies.

900
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:48,000
Yeah, I hope he gets a daily dose of Fintanelt.

901
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,000
Fintanet.

902
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:50,000
Fintanet.

903
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:51,000
Finternel.

904
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:52,000
Finternelt.

905
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,000
Finternelt.

906
00:38:53,000 --> 00:39:00,000
Yeah, I hope he gets a one-time dose.

907
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,000
Yeah.

908
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:02,000
Of Fintanent.

909
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:03,000
Of Flinternet.

910
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:06,960
are meant and it sounds like a toothpaste though I hope that guy chokes on his

911
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:12,240
toothpaste and I hope it's spicy toothpaste and it hurts his throat when

912
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:17,200
I show you that spicy I hate a spicy toothpaste to stop making that spicy

913
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:21,360
toothpaste oh y'all I ate a Reese's Cup the other day it was spicy as hell you

914
00:39:21,360 --> 00:39:25,840
better make a sweet to face or that would be so good though what like a

915
00:39:25,840 --> 00:39:32,600
Reese's Cup a Reese's Cup no like a Reese's Cup with like chili powder in it

916
00:39:32,600 --> 00:39:36,600
I know that's what you meant, but I couldn't resist.

917
00:39:36,600 --> 00:39:41,040
Because they have that, like, the Lindt chocolate chili one, and that one goes crazy.

918
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:43,360
Yeah, you might enjoy Mexico.

919
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:44,360
Yeah.

920
00:39:44,360 --> 00:39:48,360
They got all kinds of freaky, spicy chocolate crickets and shit.

921
00:39:48,360 --> 00:39:49,960
What are they called?

922
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:50,960
Gozos?

923
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:51,960
Dude, I had...

924
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:54,960
Every piece of that Mexican candy he gave us was disgusting.

925
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:59,400
I ate a piece today, it's like the caramel kind of thing, and it's not very big, it's

926
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:00,400
probably like this big.

927
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:04,320
I was like, I just want like a little piece of candy and I add it in two or three bites.

928
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:11,120
And then I looked at the nutritional facts. It's like 450 calories for like two bites of candy.

929
00:40:11,120 --> 00:40:15,680
It's like it defied the laws of physics. Yeah, that's all like the dulce de leche stuff.

930
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:15,840
Yeah. Yeah.

931
00:40:15,840 --> 00:40:17,440
Is that one again?

932
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:17,920
Those little...

933
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:18,480
Dulce de leche.

934
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:18,960
Dulce de leche.

935
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:20,960
Dulce de leche.

936
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:27,520
Those those ones with the nuts on it, the dulce de leche nuts thing. You know, like the little

937
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:30,480
like it's like the toffee bar but it has like almonds and shit on it.

938
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:31,520
I don't fuck with- Those went crazy.

939
00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:33,520
Stop putting vegetables in my candy bro.

940
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:34,480
Nuts is not candy.

941
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:35,920
That's what I'm saying.

942
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:36,960
Nuts is not vegetables.

943
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:39,600
Tell that to the ground where they're from.

944
00:40:39,600 --> 00:40:40,100
Yeah.

945
00:40:40,100 --> 00:40:41,280
Fucking moron.

946
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:42,400
What about peanut butter?

947
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:44,000
That's vegetables.

948
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,800
You don't like peanut butter chocolate?

949
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:49,440
Of course I love peanut butter but I don't- I mean-

950
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:51,440
That's mostly the butter work in there.

951
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:54,800
Well you gotta try this candy bar out. It's chocolate and celery.

952
00:40:55,360 --> 00:40:57,920
That doesn't sound very good. That sounds very vegetal.

953
00:40:57,920 --> 00:40:58,640
Too crunchy.

954
00:40:58,640 --> 00:41:00,080
Yeah. Check this out.

955
00:41:00,080 --> 00:41:01,920
That's too crunchy for my white ass.

956
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:02,800
My teeth will break.

957
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:04,800
Here's a crazy combo I just thought of.

958
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:05,520
Okay.

959
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:06,560
Celery.

960
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:07,360
Yep.

961
00:41:07,360 --> 00:41:08,880
Put peanut butter in the shoot.

962
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:09,600
Okay.

963
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:10,560
The shoot.

964
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:11,120
The shoot.

965
00:41:11,120 --> 00:41:13,040
And then you put raisins on top of it.

966
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:14,720
Okay. Well, what are we going to call it?

967
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:16,400
Probably dookies on a log.

968
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:16,880
Yeah.

969
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:18,640
Little turds on a brown thing.

970
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:19,040
Yeah.

971
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:20,080
Turds on a turd river.

972
00:41:20,080 --> 00:41:21,440
Turds on a turd on a celery.

973
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:22,160
No, I call it a--

974
00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:23,760
Two turds on celery.

975
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:24,960
I call it a green and brown.

976
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:31,320
yeah no you don't yeah that's an Irish thing yeah yeah come out you green and

977

980
00:41:49,800 --> 00:41:58,460

981
00:41:58,460 --> 00:42:03,640
saying like fuck you black and tans mmm yeah yeah you don't like the blacks and

982
00:42:03,640 --> 00:42:10,740
the tans listen Eric Clapton what a rant in his concert about black and tans and

983
00:42:10,740 --> 00:42:14,400
you have a rant in your life about black and I have a rant in my notes app I keep

984
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:22,680
about blacks and tans. Tans. I'm sick of all these people coming out of the fucking tanning

985
00:42:22,680 --> 00:42:28,960
booths. Check out these greenos. These greenos and the tans. Oh dude, the Jersey Shore cast,

986
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:34,760
I'm so sick of them. I thought they were called greenos when I was a kid. Yeah. Yeah. But

987
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:41,040
um. What are they talking about? Blacks and tans, now you don't care much for that. Yeah.

988
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:45,900
Oh yeah, there's a drink, the black and tan.

989
00:42:45,900 --> 00:42:46,900
Yep.

990
00:42:46,900 --> 00:42:47,900
There's another one, Sprite.

991
00:42:47,900 --> 00:42:48,900
It's messed up.

992
00:42:48,900 --> 00:42:50,420
Sprite, pretty good.

993
00:42:50,420 --> 00:42:51,420
Lemon and lime.

994
00:42:51,420 --> 00:42:53,140
A combination I would have never thought of.

995
00:42:53,140 --> 00:42:54,140
I had a drink earlier that was...

996
00:42:54,140 --> 00:42:56,780
I would have thought lemon and lime was going to be pretty redundant.

997
00:42:56,780 --> 00:42:57,780
Turns out it's...

998
00:42:57,780 --> 00:42:59,860
They're a compliment to each other.

999
00:42:59,860 --> 00:43:01,420
They're kind of crazy good together.

1000
00:43:01,420 --> 00:43:07,220
See, that's the thing, like lemon and lime works, but if you have like a orange and lemon,

1001
00:43:07,220 --> 00:43:08,220
it's not that good.

1002
00:43:08,220 --> 00:43:09,220
It's not as good as lemon.

1003
00:43:09,220 --> 00:43:12,220
Or like if you have like lemon and poo.

1004
00:43:12,220 --> 00:43:13,060
It usually isn't true.

1005
00:43:13,060 --> 00:43:13,880
- What the hell?

1006
00:43:13,880 --> 00:43:14,720
Okay. - They're together.

1007
00:43:14,720 --> 00:43:18,420
- I would like to honestly go the other way on this.

1008
00:43:18,420 --> 00:43:21,700
I think that poop would be greatly,

1009
00:43:21,700 --> 00:43:25,320
greatly improved with lemon juice all over it.

1010
00:43:25,320 --> 00:43:27,180
- But lemon would be dragged down.

1011
00:43:27,180 --> 00:43:28,900
- But lemon on the other hand,

1012
00:43:28,900 --> 00:43:29,980
lemon's like, I don't know if you've ever

1013
00:43:29,980 --> 00:43:30,980
put a lemon in your mouth.

1014
00:43:30,980 --> 00:43:32,740
It's not great to begin with.

1015
00:43:32,740 --> 00:43:34,740
But to have kind of,

1016
00:43:34,740 --> 00:43:37,620
something about if you added poop to lemon,

1017
00:43:37,620 --> 00:43:38,920
you'd be like, oh, this sucks.

1018
00:43:38,920 --> 00:43:40,920
But if you added lemon to poop, it'd be a bit of a relief.

1019
00:43:40,920 --> 00:43:42,920
You squeeze a lemon over it like it's a shrimp?

1020
00:43:42,920 --> 00:43:43,920
Yeah, exactly.

1021
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:45,920
And it's curled like a shrimp.

1022
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:48,920
And you've got to de-vein it like a shrimp.

1023
00:43:48,920 --> 00:43:51,920
Well, yeah, that's the best part about poop.

1024
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:54,920
It's all the shrimp's vein.

1025
00:43:54,920 --> 00:43:56,920
I love eating the shrimp veins.

1026
00:43:56,920 --> 00:43:59,920
Just collect all the veins and give them to me.

1027
00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:01,920
There's something about them.

1028
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:04,920
I love eating shrimp so much.

1029
00:44:04,920 --> 00:44:06,920
I'd be down to get some seafood this weekend.

1030
00:44:06,920 --> 00:44:07,760
- Oh fuck yeah, dude.

1031
00:44:07,760 --> 00:44:08,600
- I haven't had it in a while.

1032
00:44:08,600 --> 00:44:09,420
- We should get some safe food.

1033
00:44:09,420 --> 00:44:10,380
- You know what, I've never been to one of those places

1034
00:44:10,380 --> 00:44:12,300
where they just give you like a fucked up bag

1035
00:44:12,300 --> 00:44:13,380
and you pour it on the table.

1036
00:44:13,380 --> 00:44:14,220
- Yep.

1037
00:44:14,220 --> 00:44:15,040
- I've never done that.

1038
00:44:15,040 --> 00:44:15,880
- I wanna do that shit.

1039
00:44:15,880 --> 00:44:16,720

80 shrimp, one sitting.

1043
00:44:24,740 --> 00:44:27,020
- I thought you said any shrimp.

00:44:27,020 --> 00:44:27,860
- Let's do it.

00:44:27,860 --> 00:44:28,680
- 80 shrimp?

1046
00:44:28,680 --> 00:44:29,520
- I can eat 80 shrimp in one sitting.

1047
00:44:29,520 --> 00:44:30,360
- Let's do it.

1048
00:44:30,360 --> 00:44:31,180
- I'd like to see you try.

00:44:31,180 --> 00:44:32,320

00:45:22,260 --> 00:45:26,140
YouTube we can get like one of those the shrimp rings at Costco that have like a

I could eat 80 pieces of popcorn but I might throw up.

1068
00:45:56,420 --> 00:45:58,420
I might get so full.

1069
00:45:58,420 --> 00:46:00,420
What size popcorn?

1070
00:46:00,420 --> 00:46:02,420
Little. Unpopped.

1071
00:46:02,420 --> 00:46:03,420
Kernels.

1072
00:46:03,420 --> 00:46:04,420
That's pretty easy I would say.

1073
00:46:04,420 --> 00:46:09,420
Dude, we've been talking about it. I think we've had this conversation twice this week, but half popped kernel.

1074
00:46:09,420 --> 00:46:15,420
Oh yeah, if they could somehow figure out a way to sell half popped kernel popcorn.

1075
00:46:15,420 --> 00:46:16,420
That'd be perfect.

1076
00:46:16,420 --> 00:46:17,420
That'd be so...

1077
00:46:17,420 --> 00:46:18,420
You like those?

1078
00:46:18,420 --> 00:46:19,420
Oh, those are the best.

1079
00:46:19,420 --> 00:46:20,420
Those are the best.

1080
00:46:20,420 --> 00:46:24,980
Because it's like eating a nut, but like, it's like a nut, like a microwave popcorn.

1081
00:46:24,980 --> 00:46:27,300
Have you ever tried eating raw popcorn?

1082
00:46:27,300 --> 00:46:28,740
Just the kernels?

1083
00:46:28,740 --> 00:46:29,060
No.

1084
00:46:29,060 --> 00:46:30,580
Well, what if you might like it?

1085
00:46:30,580 --> 00:46:31,380
No, that's not the same.

1086
00:46:31,380 --> 00:46:32,740
If you like the half popped, you might like it.

1087
00:46:32,740 --> 00:46:34,180
It's too hard, right?

1088
00:46:34,180 --> 00:46:35,300
It's too hard.

1089
00:46:35,300 --> 00:46:35,780
Yeah.

1090
00:46:35,780 --> 00:46:36,740
It's not the same.

1091
00:46:36,740 --> 00:46:37,140
Okay.

1092
00:46:37,140 --> 00:46:39,780
I just like that extra chew, you know?

1093
00:46:39,780 --> 00:46:40,180
Yeah.

1094
00:46:40,180 --> 00:46:44,260
Because it like, you bite down into it and it's just like the burst of like the butter flavor.

1095
00:46:44,260 --> 00:46:45,940
It's like a buckwheat popcorn.

1096
00:46:45,940 --> 00:46:46,500
Yeah.

1097
00:46:46,500 --> 00:46:48,500
It's got a little more bite to it.

1098
00:46:48,500 --> 00:46:49,460
It's got umami.

1099
00:46:49,460 --> 00:46:54,300
Oh mommy, when I'm with you mommy.

1100
00:46:54,300 --> 00:46:55,300
Nope.

1101
00:46:55,300 --> 00:46:56,300
I knew it.

1102
00:46:56,300 --> 00:46:57,300
I say oh mommy.

1103
00:46:57,300 --> 00:46:58,300
I knew it was going there.

1104
00:46:58,300 --> 00:46:59,300
Oh mommy.

1105
00:46:59,300 --> 00:47:00,300
Fuck, fuck.

1106
00:47:00,300 --> 00:47:01,300
Yep, you got the right idea.

1107
00:47:01,300 --> 00:47:03,940
She's popping my kernel, halfway.

1108
00:47:03,940 --> 00:47:05,340
I'll be popping the kernel.

1109
00:47:05,340 --> 00:47:06,340
She slurred special Sanders.

1110
00:47:06,340 --> 00:47:07,420
You'll be popping her kernel?

1111
00:47:07,420 --> 00:47:08,820
I'll be popping the kernel Sanders.

1112
00:47:08,820 --> 00:47:09,820
I eat a double down every day.

1113
00:47:09,820 --> 00:47:10,820
You'll be popping your own mom's kernel?

1114
00:47:10,820 --> 00:47:11,820
What the hell are you talking about?

1115
00:47:11,820 --> 00:47:12,820
I'm not talking about my mom, I'm talking about KFC.

1116
00:47:12,820 --> 00:47:15,420
You treat your mom like a chicken breast?

1117
00:47:15,420 --> 00:47:16,420
No.

1118
00:47:16,420 --> 00:47:17,420
What's wrong with you?

1119
00:47:17,420 --> 00:47:20,080
Yeah, I got your mom's thigh pieces though.

1120
00:47:20,080 --> 00:47:21,080
Finger licking.

1121
00:47:21,080 --> 00:47:22,080
Yeah.

1122
00:47:22,080 --> 00:47:24,080
She gave me the original recipe.

1123
00:47:24,080 --> 00:47:26,240
Do they still sell the double down?

1124
00:47:26,240 --> 00:47:27,240
Fucked her a million.

1125
00:47:27,240 --> 00:47:28,240
I don't know.

1126
00:47:28,240 --> 00:47:34,000
I haven't been to KFC in a while.

1127
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:37,600
I think KFC has pretty, I think KFC might be underrated though.

1128
00:47:37,600 --> 00:47:38,600
Yeah.

1129
00:47:38,600 --> 00:47:39,600
Chicken style.

1130
00:47:39,600 --> 00:47:42,080
I think I've still only been to KFC two times.

1131
00:47:42,080 --> 00:47:43,080
Maybe one.

1132
00:47:43,080 --> 00:47:44,080
Oh yeah.

1133
00:47:44,080 --> 00:47:46,280
We all know about the first time.

1134
00:47:46,280 --> 00:47:47,280
Two.

1135
00:47:47,280 --> 00:47:50,460
- We should do, we'll do shrimp, we'll do KFC.

1136
00:47:50,460 --> 00:47:52,540
- Not on the same day, are you kidding?

1137
00:47:52,540 --> 00:47:53,800
You're a madman.

1138
00:47:53,800 --> 00:47:54,640
- Same day.

1139
00:47:54,640 --> 00:47:57,840
- Jesus Christ, this shot, this booster's making him go crazy.

1140
00:47:57,840 --> 00:47:59,520
- You might actually get iodine poisoning

1141
00:47:59,520 --> 00:48:00,560
if you eat 80 shrimp.

1142
00:48:00,560 --> 00:48:01,400
- No.

1143
00:48:01,400 --> 00:48:02,220
- Yep.

1144
00:48:02,220 --> 00:48:03,060
- I'd be fine.

1145
00:48:03,060 --> 00:48:03,900
- Nope.

1146
00:48:03,900 --> 00:48:04,720
You would die.

1147
00:48:04,720 --> 00:48:05,560
- I'm saying we're gonna take a video.

1148
00:48:05,560 --> 00:48:06,400
- I've literally eaten you.

1149
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:07,700
- Imagine if he goes to the hospital

1150
00:48:07,700 --> 00:48:09,160
at the end of the video.

1151
00:48:09,160 --> 00:48:11,640
- We should do is we should hire an EMS

1152
00:48:11,640 --> 00:48:13,020
to check his vitals on site.

1153
00:48:13,020 --> 00:48:15,080
- Yeah, just like, yeah, to have him hooked up

1154
00:48:15,080 --> 00:48:16,880
to a bunch of machines as he--

1155
00:48:16,880 --> 00:48:20,160
just see his blood pressure go up as he eats shrimp?

1156
00:48:20,160 --> 00:48:21,160
Yeah.

1157
00:48:21,160 --> 00:48:22,160
That'd be awesome, dude.

1158
00:48:22,160 --> 00:48:23,160
That'd be so tight.

1159
00:48:23,160 --> 00:48:24,160
How do you fix iodine poisoning?

1160
00:48:24,160 --> 00:48:25,160
That'd be one of the coolest videos of all time.

1161
00:48:25,160 --> 00:48:26,160
What's the opposite of iodine?

1162
00:48:26,160 --> 00:48:27,160
Myodine.

1163
00:48:27,160 --> 00:48:33,360
So you have to sip myo and dine on it.

1164
00:48:33,360 --> 00:48:34,360
Yeah.

1165
00:48:34,360 --> 00:48:39,040
Yeah, if there, I mean, I didn't think about that until you said it.

1166
00:48:39,040 --> 00:48:41,360
Now you're scared and you're never going to eat a piece of shrimp again.

1167
00:48:41,360 --> 00:48:42,360
No, I'm going to do it.

1168
00:48:42,360 --> 00:48:43,360
I'm going to do it.

1169
00:48:43,360 --> 00:48:45,560
I just like, you know, if there's like a pill that I could take, like Imodium or whatever,

1170
00:48:45,560 --> 00:48:50,000
Some kind of pill that reverse iodine poisoning.

1171
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:52,040
You need to get yourself a sody.

1172
00:48:52,040 --> 00:48:53,040
Yum.

1173
00:48:53,040 --> 00:48:54,040
True.

1174
00:48:54,040 --> 00:48:57,560
Man, hopefully a doctor listens to this and tells me exactly what.

1175
00:48:57,560 --> 00:48:58,560
If you can eat 80 shrimp.

1176
00:48:58,560 --> 00:48:59,560
Exactly what.

1177
00:48:59,560 --> 00:49:01,720
Yeah, somebody is listening, tell us something.

1178
00:49:01,720 --> 00:49:02,720
Somebody stop him.

1179
00:49:02,720 --> 00:49:03,720
No.

1180
00:49:03,720 --> 00:49:04,720
Nobody stop him.

1181
00:49:04,720 --> 00:49:05,720
Please somebody stop him.

1182
00:49:05,720 --> 00:49:06,720
Do the opposite of stop him.

1183
00:49:06,720 --> 00:49:07,720
I could eat.

1184
00:49:07,720 --> 00:49:09,280
Have you guys ever done a food challenge before?

1185
00:49:09,280 --> 00:49:11,680
Which one?

1186
00:49:11,680 --> 00:49:12,680
Every food is a challenge.

1187
00:49:12,680 --> 00:49:14,940
(laughter)

1188
00:49:14,940 --> 00:49:17,800
- Hot chip challenge.

1189
00:49:17,800 --> 00:49:20,420
- That doesn't fucking count.

1190
00:49:20,420 --> 00:49:21,260
At a restaurant.

1191
00:49:21,260 --> 00:49:22,660
- Oh, at a restaurant.

1192
00:49:22,660 --> 00:49:23,500
No.

1193
00:49:23,500 --> 00:49:25,140
- Oh, I did the blazing challenge at Buffalo Wild Wings.

1194
00:49:25,140 --> 00:49:27,460
- I did the burger challenge in Persona 5.

1195
00:49:27,460 --> 00:49:30,540
It was really hard, I threw up.

1196
00:49:30,540 --> 00:49:32,060
- I'm still on one of the walls

1197
00:49:32,060 --> 00:49:34,900
of Buffalo Wild Wings in North Carolina.

1198
00:49:34,900 --> 00:49:36,220
- We should've, why didn't you take us there?

1199
00:49:36,220 --> 00:49:37,380
- I should've, yeah.

1200
00:49:37,380 --> 00:49:41,500
I had the, at one point I was the youngest person

1201
00:49:41,500 --> 00:49:44,100
to ever do the Blazin' Challenge.

1202
00:49:44,100 --> 00:49:44,940
- Damn.

1203
00:49:44,940 --> 00:49:45,780
- Yeah.

1204
00:49:45,780 --> 00:49:46,600
- I was like--

1205
00:49:46,600 --> 00:49:48,100
- You use that on your, like, if you get booked on like a

1206
00:49:48,100 --> 00:49:48,940
show.

1207
00:49:48,940 --> 00:49:49,780
- I was like nine years old.

1208
00:49:49,780 --> 00:49:52,080
- You get booked on a show and your credit is Buffalo

1209
00:49:52,080 --> 00:49:52,920
Wild Wings.

1210
00:49:52,920 --> 00:49:53,740
- I remember that was like--

1211
00:49:53,740 --> 00:49:54,580
- So I go, writer for Patriot Act.

1212
00:49:54,580 --> 00:49:55,420
- That was probably--

1213
00:49:55,420 --> 00:49:57,140
(laughing)

1214
00:49:57,140 --> 00:50:02,100
That was probably like the first time I like had like a

1215
00:50:02,100 --> 00:50:05,580
like thought about killing myself.

1216
00:50:05,580 --> 00:50:06,420
- Yeah.

1217
00:50:06,420 --> 00:50:08,700
- Was I was like nine years old and I did the Blazin'

1218
00:50:08,700 --> 00:50:10,620
Challenge and then the next two days I was just like on

1219
00:50:10,620 --> 00:50:14,820
the toilet just like oh yeah spewing shit now if there if I could kill myself

1220
00:50:14,820 --> 00:50:18,580
painlessly right now I would yeah yeah I have to go pee so bad

1221
00:50:18,580 --> 00:50:24,940
okay we can pause okay we're back what we're back after a long time I ate a

1222
00:50:24,940 --> 00:50:30,100

1223
00:50:30,100 --> 00:50:34,780

1224
00:50:34,780 --> 00:50:40,180
really bad that's right next to the bedroom my girl is in there good that's

1225
00:50:40,180 --> 00:50:41,180
That's horrible.

1226
00:50:41,180 --> 00:50:42,180
It stinks up your whole house.

1227
00:50:42,180 --> 00:50:44,900
I think you guys violated the Geneva Conventions.

1228
00:50:44,900 --> 00:50:49,440
You always be coming to my house dropping bombs in my bathroom before you leave, bro.

1229
00:50:49,440 --> 00:50:51,780
You always be recording, you go, "Oh, my stomach hurts.

1230
00:50:51,780 --> 00:50:53,460
I gotta take a shit before I leave."

1231
00:50:53,460 --> 00:50:58,500
Then I walk in there and it smells like a dog.

1232
00:50:58,500 --> 00:51:00,660
It smells like an animal's fur.

1233
00:51:00,660 --> 00:51:04,500
So I'm going blow for blow with you now from now on.

1234
00:51:04,500 --> 00:51:08,440
I'm just glad you guys don't like coming to my house.

1235
00:51:08,440 --> 00:51:12,380
You have the most disgusting, fucked up bathroom I've ever seen.

1236
00:51:12,380 --> 00:51:16,920
Your bathroom looks like it's in like, like the toilet looks like a scary toilet from a

1237
00:51:16,920 --> 00:51:17,920
Resident Evil game.

1238
00:51:17,920 --> 00:51:18,920
Yeah.

1239
00:51:18,920 --> 00:51:19,920
Yeah.

1240
00:51:19,920 --> 00:51:21,280
It looks like you, oh reach into the toilet and grab a key.

1241
00:51:21,280 --> 00:51:23,280
It looks like a, this toilet from Saw.

1242
00:51:23,280 --> 00:51:24,280
Saw toilet, yeah.

1243
00:51:24,280 --> 00:51:25,280
It's bad dude.

1244
00:51:25,280 --> 00:51:26,280
Because my hair is on it.

1245
00:51:26,280 --> 00:51:32,240
No, it's because it's got yellow shit and piss streaks that are like fossilized around

1246
00:51:32,240 --> 00:51:33,240
the bowl.

1247
00:51:33,240 --> 00:51:35,080
I gotta get one of those blue things in there.

1248
00:51:35,080 --> 00:51:36,080
What?

1249
00:51:36,080 --> 00:51:37,080
Just scrub it.

1250
00:51:37,080 --> 00:51:38,080
Just wash it.

1251
00:51:38,080 --> 00:51:43,280
no. What do you mean? It flushes water that means it's cleaning it so I don't have to

1252
00:51:43,280 --> 00:51:47,040
do that. That's true. And you don't have to clean the shower either. Think about how

1253
00:51:47,040 --> 00:51:52,320
much of that stuff is is whenever you drop a huge log and it's bombs away

1254
00:51:52,320 --> 00:51:56,040
think about how much of that water is splashing up and getting on your legs

1255
00:51:56,040 --> 00:51:59,720
and your butt. Oh damn yeah good point. I've never thought about that. You probably have the most

1256
00:51:59,720 --> 00:52:06,920
fucked up stinky butt. Let me smell it. You're not doing that to me. Why? Just a

1257
00:52:06,920 --> 00:52:13,920
with

1258
00:52:13,920 --> 00:52:17,660
you want to take your pants off my shirt to do this to me because he told

1259
00:52:17,660 --> 00:52:21,480
everybody on the last premium that his wife did that to him

1260
00:52:21,480 --> 00:52:26,080
no she's checked my but to see if i had a c_e_o_ here and i want to check your

1261
00:52:26,080 --> 00:52:29,360
but like a baby and i try to do it to me i don't want to see if you're what i

1262
00:52:29,360 --> 00:52:31,960
want to see if you smell through your pants

1263
00:52:31,960 --> 00:52:35,160
well these are all but now that there's a there's a lot of variables here these

1264
00:52:35,160 --> 00:52:39,280
old pants. He's already hedging his bets. Old pants shouldn't smell like poop though.

1265
00:52:39,280 --> 00:52:43,920
You gotta skate it in these. Did you skate it through poop? Skate it through a dookie

1266
00:52:43,920 --> 00:52:48,320
field? New York baby. It's New York, you gotta skate through it. This is, you are proving

1267
00:52:48,320 --> 00:52:53,240
the fact that you won't let me smell your butt. You're fine, come here. Can I take a

1268
00:52:53,240 --> 00:53:04,440
picture of you smelling his butt Caleb? Yeah. I'm not happy to report this, cause it's funnier

1269
00:53:04,440 --> 00:53:08,940
if it smells like poop. Smells like fresh out of the laundry.

1270
00:53:08,940 --> 00:53:09,940
Wow.

1271
00:53:09,940 --> 00:53:13,860
Yeah. Smells really good. That's why I took a couple, I took a little extra.

1272
00:53:13,860 --> 00:53:14,860
Yeah.

1273
00:53:14,860 --> 00:53:17,860
I took it, I went back for seconds.

1274
00:53:17,860 --> 00:53:18,860
Yeah.

1275
00:53:18,860 --> 00:53:20,480
Yeah, that was decent.

1276
00:53:20,480 --> 00:53:23,360
Yeah, that was very decent of you to let me do that.

1277
00:53:23,360 --> 00:53:27,780
If there's one thing about me, I'm not, I'm probably not clean in any other sense.

1278
00:53:27,780 --> 00:53:28,780
But that butt is smelly.

1279
00:53:28,780 --> 00:53:32,240
You got to keep your ass clean. You got to wash your ass.

1280
00:53:32,240 --> 00:53:33,240
You got to wash your ass.

1281
00:53:33,240 --> 00:53:34,240
I've heard that.

1282
00:53:34,240 --> 00:53:38,520
shower technique my shower technique I'd be like I pretty much fist myself every

1283
00:53:38,520 --> 00:53:41,920
time I'm in the shower yeah you gotta get up in there you got clean it it's worth

1284
00:53:41,920 --> 00:53:46,400
worse I've been getting in I've been getting in I've been taking baths more

1285
00:53:46,400 --> 00:53:52,840
often recently and so like well Jana will walk in and I'm like it looks like

1286
00:53:52,840 --> 00:53:57,440
I'm doing fucking live jasmine in my fucking bathtub just like shoving a

1287
00:53:57,440 --> 00:54:03,960
fucking like doing this and just shoving it in my ass yeah I have but I do use a

1288
00:54:03,960 --> 00:54:09,560
a washcloth. I got a loofah thing. You have a butt washcloth? Not a loofah but a squishy

1289
00:54:09,560 --> 00:54:13,040
thing. You put it into your butt? You know what I'm talking about? Of course. You get

1290
00:54:13,040 --> 00:54:17,720
one for your face and one for your ass and your body. I don't even care about that. I

1291
00:54:17,720 --> 00:54:21,840
use the same thing for everything. That's some white people shit. Yes sir. I have the

1292
00:54:21,840 --> 00:54:28,120
squishy. Yeah, a loofah. That is a loofah? No, because a loofah is like different. A

1293
00:54:28,120 --> 00:54:30,700
- The aloofa's the one that has the--

1294
00:54:30,700 --> 00:54:31,760
- No. - Has ribbons.

1295
00:54:31,760 --> 00:54:32,600
- Yeah.

1296
00:54:32,600 --> 00:54:34,720
- No, the aloofa's different from the squishy.

1297
00:54:34,720 --> 00:54:36,400
- Are you talking about a sponge right now?

1298
00:54:36,400 --> 00:54:37,240
- I just described what a aloofa is.

1299
00:54:37,240 --> 00:54:38,760
- It's not a sponge.

1300
00:54:38,760 --> 00:54:40,760
- But it is squishy and porous?

1301
00:54:40,760 --> 00:54:41,600
- It's like the--

1302
00:54:41,600 --> 00:54:43,920
- Aloofa looks like a sea creature.

1303
00:54:43,920 --> 00:54:47,080
- Well, yeah, aloofa's like a plant, right?

1304
00:54:47,080 --> 00:54:47,920
- I don't think so.

1305
00:54:47,920 --> 00:54:48,760
- What?

1306
00:54:48,760 --> 00:54:49,580
- Well, here's a fact that'll blow your mind.

1307
00:54:49,580 --> 00:54:50,420
- I think aloofa-- - What?

1308
00:54:50,420 --> 00:54:52,400
You say aloofa's a plant? - Hold on, yeah.

1309
00:54:52,400 --> 00:54:54,780
I thought like aloofa's like, hold on.

1310
00:54:57,280 --> 00:54:59,520
What the fuck are you talking about, man?

1311
00:54:59,520 --> 00:55:04,040
Yeah.

1312
00:55:04,040 --> 00:55:09,640
Yeah, luffa is a tropical, yeah, and it's used--

1313
00:55:09,640 --> 00:55:10,660
- Let me see it.

1314
00:55:10,660 --> 00:55:14,280
That's not even how you spell luffa.

1315
00:55:14,280 --> 00:55:16,960
- Look, it says it right there, a shower luffa.

1316
00:55:16,960 --> 00:55:18,080
There might be a-- - The luffa often spelled

1317
00:55:18,080 --> 00:55:19,480
luffa with two O's. - There might be a plant

1318
00:55:19,480 --> 00:55:21,800
called luffa, but this is-- - This is not a luffa.

1319
00:55:21,800 --> 00:55:22,640
- Yes, it is. - The shower luffa

1320
00:55:22,640 --> 00:55:25,780
that you get at Target, search shower luffa.

1321
00:55:26,640 --> 00:55:31,140
do this is the yeah

1322
00:55:31,140 --> 00:55:34,780
this is the well yeah bathroom loofah sponge

1323
00:55:34,780 --> 00:55:37,680
right there that's not what i'm talking about all yeah that exactly that's what

1324
00:55:37,680 --> 00:55:40,060
i'm saying you talking about this one

1325
00:55:40,060 --> 00:55:43,480
this is what i think of when i think of a little while when i think of lupo i

1326
00:55:43,480 --> 00:55:46,200
think of the plant

1327
00:55:46,200 --> 00:55:49,360
the i'm looking at all right now that no i don't have this

1328
00:55:49,360 --> 00:55:53,980
i have that you search our lupo this is all it comes up

1329
00:55:53,980 --> 00:55:56,360
This is all the top images. They're all this.

1330
00:55:56,360 --> 00:55:58,660
Now I believe you've never washed your ass.

1331
00:55:58,660 --> 00:56:00,740
And you've never taken a shower.

1332
00:56:00,740 --> 00:56:03,500
That's why I smell so good. It's my body's natural oils.

1333
00:56:03,500 --> 00:56:07,240
It's covering itself up. You're cocooning.

1334
00:56:07,240 --> 00:56:09,980
But yeah, that's a...

1335
00:56:09,980 --> 00:56:13,980
There's the plant one and there's the synthetic one.

1336
00:56:13,980 --> 00:56:15,460
So you use that?

1337
00:56:15,460 --> 00:56:18,400
Yeah. Okay, so you do use aloofa.

1338
00:56:18,400 --> 00:56:22,020
Yeah, but I didn't think that was called aloofa. I just bought it because I was like,

1339
00:56:22,020 --> 00:56:25,180
oh that thing's from the shower. I don't like I think loofahs are probably even

1340
00:56:25,180 --> 00:56:29,380
more dirty than a you know because a rag. Yeah it's a plant. I wash my rags like every time I

1341
00:56:29,380 --> 00:56:33,660
take a shower every other time. Yeah. But the like a loofah just no one's ever

1342
00:56:33,660 --> 00:56:37,600
washed a loofah. Yeah I use a toothbrush to wash my whole body. And my teeth. Yeah I have a

1343
00:56:37,600 --> 00:56:42,340
toothbrush that I use to wash my ass with and it's electric. Yeah. Are you guys on the

1344
00:56:42,340 --> 00:56:46,700
tip of you you like always close the toilet lid when you flush the toilet? No.

1345
00:56:46,700 --> 00:56:48,700
Yeah, I am.

1346
00:56:48,700 --> 00:56:55,580
Which it makes me, I'm not like a germaphobe at all, but yeah, my toilet lid broke off and

1347
00:56:55,580 --> 00:56:56,580
it makes me very...

1348
00:56:56,580 --> 00:56:57,580
That's my bed.

1349
00:56:57,580 --> 00:56:58,580
Yeah, it actually...

1350
00:56:58,580 --> 00:56:59,780
I go in there and I kick that thing.

1351
00:56:59,780 --> 00:57:01,660
It'd be funny if it was your bed.

1352
00:57:01,660 --> 00:57:03,460
I really wish it was.

1353
00:57:03,460 --> 00:57:05,860
Well, for weeks that thing was like...

1354
00:57:05,860 --> 00:57:07,260
It's been fucked up for a long time.

1355
00:57:07,260 --> 00:57:08,260
It's been fucked up since you moved in.

1356
00:57:08,260 --> 00:57:12,260
Yeah, but the lid completely broke off though recently and it makes me like, yeah, getting

1357
00:57:12,260 --> 00:57:16,580
in the shower and knowing that the toilet seat is open like it's like some it's

1358
00:57:16,580 --> 00:57:21,980
gonna the steam is gonna fly in there and then fly back into my face it's a good

1359
00:57:21,980 --> 00:57:27,460
point your toothbrush you're worried about the steam flying out of the shower

1360
00:57:27,460 --> 00:57:30,980
yeah it's like that's what I'm not really it's like it's like a supernatural

1361
00:57:30,980 --> 00:57:37,660
like like kind of like you know you're opening it's like a miasma fear spirit

1362
00:57:37,660 --> 00:57:41,700
see I would never think to fuck I also am worried sometimes that stuff will fall

1363
00:57:41,700 --> 00:57:47,060
off the sink and into the toilet. Oh yeah. I've had toothbrushes do that man. Have

1364
00:57:47,060 --> 00:57:51,780
you ever dropped your phone in the toilet before? I had a phone. Have I? The first

1365
00:57:51,780 --> 00:57:57,780
phone I ever had I took an insanely like crazy diarrhea and then I dropped my

1366
00:57:57,780 --> 00:58:02,040
phone in. Oh my god. And then I like tried to wash it out but there was and I

1367
00:58:02,040 --> 00:58:05,220
didn't I didn't have like money for another phone so I just had to like put

1368
00:58:05,220 --> 00:58:10,220
it in rice and then like oh fucking like you keep using the phone and I remember

1369
00:58:10,220 --> 00:58:15,680
there was like a black spot under the screen and I swear it was do do oh yeah

1370
00:58:15,680 --> 00:58:19,720
the screen was cracked also yeah yeah the dookie got into the phone oh my god

1371
00:58:19,720 --> 00:58:24,880
you put this is a dookie cyborg I was using that's so cool I kept it for a

1372
00:58:24,880 --> 00:58:28,520
long time yeah that'd be cool if your phone like grew a spore because of a

1373
00:58:28,520 --> 00:58:32,760
dookie that was in it yeah it's a sport but it's a child of mine a silo side

1374
00:58:32,760 --> 00:58:37,840
mushroom yeah exactly silo side bin mushrooms come from poop right yeah

1375
00:58:37,840 --> 00:58:42,700
Yeah, yeah, yeah, my mom was telling me that they used to find them in the

1376
00:58:42,700 --> 00:58:50,200
Like all the farms kids in North Carolina. Damn. Yeah, that's cool. It looks at no terror farm

1377
00:58:50,200 --> 00:58:54,720
I said, would you you've done mushrooms? I haven't done much. Yeah, I've done a

1378
00:58:54,720 --> 00:58:59,940
I wanted like I was gonna do a time this year. Yeah, cuz it's just food poisoning, right?

1379
00:58:59,940 --> 00:59:07,340
Well, you put on a poison yourself in the way that every like psychedelic drug is true and alcohol to every

1380
00:59:07,340 --> 00:59:10,840
Every drug in the world is actually poison.

1381
00:59:10,840 --> 00:59:14,000
If alcohol was poison, how would it clean things?

1382
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:15,000
Pretty crazy to think about.

1383
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:16,340
It didn't clean your stinky ass.

1384
00:59:16,340 --> 00:59:17,820
Oh wait, yeah it did.

1385
00:59:17,820 --> 00:59:18,820
That's why!

1386
00:59:18,820 --> 00:59:22,620
Oh my god, you have so much fucking alcohol running through your butt that it just keeps

1387
00:59:22,620 --> 00:59:24,940
it perfectly sanitized.

1388
00:59:24,940 --> 00:59:27,060
That's why my ass smells like gain.

1389
00:59:27,060 --> 00:59:28,060
He poops white.

1390
00:59:28,060 --> 00:59:29,820
And that's why your dick is blue at the tip.

1391
00:59:29,820 --> 00:59:30,820
His poop is transparent.

1392
00:59:30,820 --> 00:59:34,140
It's the same consistency, but it's completely see-through.

1393
00:59:34,140 --> 00:59:38,340
You know what they find like the like it's like oh, this is like a pink lobster that we found

1394
00:59:38,340 --> 00:59:43,860
That's what happens in my body every day. I'm shooting one pink lobster out of my ass

1395
00:59:43,860 --> 00:59:46,260
every day

1396
00:59:46,260 --> 00:59:49,020
Yeah, mushrooms is me. They do make your stomach hurt really bad

1397
00:59:49,020 --> 00:59:55,180
Yeah, I don't want to do that if it's gonna make my tummy hurt, but they literally like expand your consciousness. Okay. Well, hold on

1398
00:59:55,180 --> 01:00:03,080
Maybe I could use some consciousness expanding. What are you talking about? I think that you you need some consciousness expanding

1399
01:00:03,140 --> 01:00:08,860
Yeah, yeah, I have hip-hop for that. I have Jedi mind tricks to do that for me

1400
01:00:08,860 --> 01:00:14,360
Yeah, well that that doesn't really explain your consciousness so much as change your perspective and but it

1401
01:00:14,360 --> 01:00:20,440
Shifts your paradigm. It's in your face. Yeah. Yeah, I guess if I listen to Jedi mind tricks on mushrooms

1402
01:00:20,440 --> 01:00:24,700
I'd probably that probably would kill you. Yeah, probably kill most people I

1403
01:00:24,700 --> 01:00:27,740
Think I I think like mushrooms can

1404
01:00:27,740 --> 01:00:32,720
More so than acid just like completely rewire your shit. Yeah

1405
01:00:32,720 --> 01:00:40,860
Yeah, like I know people who did mushrooms and like we were like well like like annoying hippie kids for like a

1406
01:00:40,860 --> 01:00:45,620
Year, and they did too many mushrooms, and they became like young Republicans. Yeah, yeah, yeah

1407
01:00:45,620 --> 01:00:50,300
I don't know like he's in the military now. He used to be like such a like like yeah

1408
01:00:50,300 --> 01:00:52,660
I think we're old enough now

1409
01:00:52,660 --> 01:00:57,800
You can't do a lot of psychedelics because it would be it would be too it would be too weird if you became a different person

1410
01:00:57,920 --> 01:01:03,400
Like people who do a ton of psychedelics when they're 17 and then they turn into a monster

1411
01:01:03,400 --> 01:01:06,160
or whatever, that's fine because they weren't a person yet.

1412
01:01:06,160 --> 01:01:07,160
Exactly.

1413
01:01:07,160 --> 01:01:08,160
Exactly.

1414
01:01:08,160 --> 01:01:09,160
When you're mid-20s, 25, that's like a brain fluid for us.

1415
01:01:09,160 --> 01:01:12,720
You can do it like once every year or so, maybe.

1416
01:01:12,720 --> 01:01:13,720
Maybe.

1417
01:01:13,720 --> 01:01:14,720
It needs to be at some kind of fucking retreat.

1418
01:01:14,720 --> 01:01:15,720
Yeah.

1419
01:01:15,720 --> 01:01:16,720
Yeah.

1420
01:01:16,720 --> 01:01:17,720
Yeah.

1421
01:01:17,720 --> 01:01:18,720
Where you'd really disrespect.

1422
01:01:18,720 --> 01:01:19,720
Oh, that would be the worst.

1423
01:01:19,720 --> 01:01:20,720
What?

1424
01:01:20,720 --> 01:01:22,720
Becoming like a different person at like 25.

1425
01:01:22,720 --> 01:01:23,720
Dude, it's great.

1426
01:01:23,720 --> 01:01:28,440
told me this like this story about this guy who he knew some guy like some guys

1427
01:01:28,440 --> 01:01:34,000
like uncle or something like like accidentally dropped like an entire

1428
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:38,720
because it was like it was like acid in like Sprite or something and basically

1429
01:01:38,720 --> 01:01:42,680
the the fucking good time thing just like happened to him where he like yeah

1430
01:01:42,680 --> 01:01:46,040
he just like drank the whole thing without realizing like the dosage and

1431
01:01:46,040 --> 01:01:50,240
like just like literally was a completely different person yeah like

1432
01:01:50,240 --> 01:01:53,200
Yeah, pretty crazy and saying I become like a genius

1433
01:01:53,200 --> 01:01:59,360
Somehow like I drink too much. I think I think I'm probably measurably stupider

1434
01:01:59,360 --> 01:02:06,760
Post like doing a bunch of drugs in like high school. Yeah. Yeah, I think I was probably probably would have ended up being a smarter person

1435
01:02:06,760 --> 01:02:10,320
Yeah, yeah, I don't think I would have no no I

1436
01:02:10,320 --> 01:02:13,440
Think I would

1437
01:02:13,440 --> 01:02:19,360
Definitely I think I think I definitely also dumbed myself down by smoking way too much weed

1438
01:02:19,560 --> 01:02:22,680
I think like like and even after quitting weed

1439
01:02:22,680 --> 01:02:29,000
I'll still sometimes like sit around and just like have thoughts like be like damn like it's crazy that like there's a soda called dr.

1440
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:31,000
pepper

1441
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:38,600
Yeah, like that's it yeah, I was just destined to be like this yeah

1442
01:02:38,600 --> 01:02:47,920
Perhaps yeah, I think it's fate. Yeah, it's working out for you. Yeah, I'm doing your but nice fine

1443
01:02:47,920 --> 01:02:51,920
It's made my butt smell so good apparently.

1444
01:02:51,920 --> 01:02:55,040
I'm not going to over, it doesn't smell so good.

1445
01:02:55,040 --> 01:02:56,800
I don't want to take a bite.

1446
01:02:56,800 --> 01:02:57,800
I do.

1447
01:02:57,800 --> 01:02:59,920
I think it smells good for a butt.

1448
01:02:59,920 --> 01:03:00,920
Okay.

1449
01:03:00,920 --> 01:03:02,000
I'll give you that.

1450
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:04,000
Your butt smells good for a butt.

1451
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:06,280
Next week I'm checking cam.

1452
01:03:06,280 --> 01:03:07,280
Don't prepare.

1453
01:03:07,280 --> 01:03:08,280
Bye.

1454
01:03:08,280 --> 01:03:09,280
Bye.
