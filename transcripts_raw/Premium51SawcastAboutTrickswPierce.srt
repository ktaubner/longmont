00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,000
[Music]

2
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:22,000
We, uh, uh, we, the, the, the screen turn on, and, uh, we see, um, a man's face.

3
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Looks a little bit like, looks a little Iberian.

4
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Um...

5
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,500
Alec Wahlberg.

6
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:35,000
The first sensation you have upon regaining consciousness is a searing headache.

7
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Wincing from pain?

8
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,500
Yeah. You shut your eyes tight before they even get a chance to open.

9
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:46,000
And only after a few seconds of this do you realize your eyes are swollen and you're shut,

10
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:51,000
and the feeling of closing them is not unlike a knuckle needing a bruise.

11
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,500
The last time you felt this way was St. Paddy's Day, 1985,

12
00:00:55,500 --> 00:01:00,700
when you got trashed with your brother Dickie, stole a police car, and drove it into an Italian-owned business.

13
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:04,500
Tell me about yourself, Alec Wahlberg.

14
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:08,500
Look, I'm fucking innocent, dude. I swear, I shouldn't be here.

15
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:13,400
You have any idea who my fucking brothers are? My name is Alec fucking Wahlberg, alright?

16
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:15,300
I'm the bruiser of the Wahlberg family.

17
00:01:15,300 --> 00:01:18,700
I do the stuff the other brothers are too fucking afraid to do, alright?

18
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:22,000
Oh, sure, Markie blinded a Vietnamese guy in '88.

19
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,900
Oh, he's so fucking tough.

20
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:26,200
You have no fucking clue what I've done, alright?

21
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:28,200
You don't know what I'm fucking capable of.

22
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:32,200
I can't even talk about the fucking shit I used to do for those guys back in Dorchester.

23
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:35,200
If they wanted someone roughed up, that's what I fucking did.

24
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:41,200
One time I chased a guy all the way to Ruggles from the Twin Donuts in fucking Austin, just fucking looking at Donnie kinda weird.

25
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:47,200
He's lucky he fell out of the train tracks, because what I would have done would have been ten times worse than touching the third rail.

26
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:51,200
Irregardless, I have done no crimes and I shouldn't be here.

27
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:55,440
All I do now is work at my family's restaurant in Linfield, far away from everybody else,

28
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:57,520
and mind my fucking business. I shouldn't be here.

29
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:01,040
Fully awake, Michael dangerous.

30
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:05,360
You start to see the red light flooding the room from above.

31
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:09,360
The low buzz of near-dead bulbs, threatening to extinguish.

32
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:12,800
You've been lying quietly on the cold stone floor,

33
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:16,080
caked in what you hope is just one person's blood and your own feces.

34
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:19,840
Quietly rap-rocking to yourself to stay calm.

35
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:23,840
What's going on Michael Dangerous, tell me about yourself.

36
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:30,840
Yeah! My name is Michael Dangerous! I am a 29 year old Fred Durst impersonator!

37
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:34,840
I'm just a crazy motherfucker, living it up, not giving a fuck, living life in the fast lane!

38
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:39,840
The first time I heard "Rollin'" air raid vehicle by Limp Bizkit, it changed my life forever!

39
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:44,840
Finally I saw a niche for myself in life, a career path where my tasteful goatee, backwards red Yankees cap,

40
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:48,840
and playful hip-hop demeanor could make me successful, not a laughing stock!

41
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:53,480
I quit my job as round-the-clock caretaker for my 29 year old son Ben Stiller

42
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:56,280
Dangerous and became happy for the first time in my life

43
00:02:56,280 --> 00:03:02,880
The most important thing to me became getting up on stage at a child's birthday party and dropping a knowledge bomb about a psycho

44
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:06,720
Females nasty nookie or if a $3 bill could ever really exist

45
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:12,760
Little PS dangerous died in a tragic energy drink accident and I was left grieving

46
00:03:12,940 --> 00:03:20,100
The only thing that brings me joy anymore is grooving and wrapping up on stage and making huge amounts of paper and fucking big-ass

47
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:22,100
Pussy and going nuts like a monster

48
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:26,900
Deeter dimbre

49
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:32,540
Your eyes adjust quickly to the room's red light and the familiar stench of death and excrement doesn't faze you

50
00:03:32,540 --> 00:03:39,500
You reach for the back of your neck something itches your nails scratch across something like rusted metal

51
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:41,900
Could it be an exciting growth?

52
00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:48,820
No. Your hand feels around to the front of your neck and it becomes clear that you have a collar perfectly fitted for your gangly farmer neck.

53
00:03:48,820 --> 00:03:52,540
Dieter Dimpre, who are you?

54
00:03:52,540 --> 00:03:55,060
My name is Dieter Dimpre.

55
00:03:55,060 --> 00:03:59,180
Sorry, wait. My name is Dieter Dimpre.

56
00:03:59,180 --> 00:04:05,960
I'm a fancier, steward, stockman, cowboy, and all-around animal husband from Cuntknuckle, Oklahoma.

57
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:11,460
I ain't never knew my parents on account of growing up in an open-air truck stop bathroom

58
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:17,140
Where I done learnt English from a glory hole, and ate vending machine critter crackers dipped in dish soap.

59
00:04:17,140 --> 00:04:22,500
Did that for a couple years till my testicles dropped, and I started itching to wander.

60
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:25,180
Hell, I guess you could say I was heeding the call of the wild.

61
00:04:25,180 --> 00:04:29,620
Anyhow, I made a blunderbuss out of faucets and pop cans and took off.

62
00:04:29,620 --> 00:04:34,940
Started seeing all kinds of critters on the plane, shaped just like those toothsome crackers

63
00:04:34,940 --> 00:04:38,940
I loved so much in my youth. I saw the strangest little critters you could picture.

64
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:44,700
Four-legged critter with a long face, two-legged critter with a pebble mouth, and a no-legged

65
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:47,860
critter with some kind of jangling boot on its tail.

66
00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:52,020
Come to think of it, that no-legged critter was my first wife.

67
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:55,980
I know it's stupid, but I thought it was the prettiest little thing.

68
00:04:55,980 --> 00:05:00,900
I saw her beady eyes and her double tongue and that clangling dangler on her tail and

69
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:06,620
I thought, and I knew, I had to build a house with a bed and lay on it with it.

70
00:05:06,620 --> 00:05:12,900
lay on the fuckin bed with the fuckin thing and so I did hand the gun and she bit my fuckin

71
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:15,780
finger so I shot her head off and ate her.

72
00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:22,140
I've been married 1, 2, 3, shh dude I'm getting dizzy, 4, 5, fuck it must be a fuckin hundred

73
00:05:22,140 --> 00:05:28,300
times married to a rock, married to a cactus, a bird, a cloud.

74
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:33,460
Right now my wife is a darling little critter I found rustling around outside on the ground.

75
00:05:33,460 --> 00:05:38,140
She's got about a hundred legs and two sharp fingers and a tail with a tooth on the end.

76
00:05:38,140 --> 00:05:41,540
I brought her inside and she lives in my bed.

77
00:05:41,540 --> 00:05:44,780
I raise all kinds of critters on my little ranch.

78
00:05:44,780 --> 00:05:48,060
Just been sitting around and watching them for years and years.

79
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:52,820
Makes me so happy to see them give each other bedroom eyes and start humping and make a

80
00:05:52,820 --> 00:05:53,820
little critter litter.

81
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:59,260
And it gives me so much joy to squeeze and suck the milk out of their pink little wieners

82
00:05:59,260 --> 00:06:02,900
and pull them shiny slimy white eggs out of their cooters.

83
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:05,300
And when they get slow and big and jiggly,

84
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:07,840
shooting their fucking heads off and eating them.

85
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:11,860
And I don't even mind when they bite my finger no more.

86
00:06:11,860 --> 00:06:13,100
Did I say my name?

87
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:14,460
It's Dada Stamper.

88
00:06:14,460 --> 00:06:16,820
Now do you have a fucking toilet I could use?

89
00:06:16,820 --> 00:06:19,380
- Okay.

90
00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:22,780
Okay.

91
00:06:22,780 --> 00:06:26,020
Jedediah Ezekiel,

92
00:06:26,020 --> 00:06:31,860
You are sitting up right pleasantly in the filthy room, the flies buzzing about the other corpses

93
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:37,180
inside, the air heavy with death and the stench of rotten flesh.

94
00:06:37,180 --> 00:06:41,160
The Amish lifestyle has made these living conditions familiar to you.

95
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:44,300
Even the collar that is around your neck is something that you've worn when the elders

96
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:47,740
punished you for shaming God for smiling at the crops.

97
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:54,060
But what is shocking to your virginal self is your stark nakedness before God and man,

98
00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:56,140
Or men, I should say.

99
00:06:56,140 --> 00:07:03,740
And what's more, the ring around your neck having a smaller twin wrapped around your pee-pee.

100
00:07:03,740 --> 00:07:07,940
Tell me about you Jedidiah Ezekiel.

101
00:07:07,940 --> 00:07:11,160
Arden Meneer, my name is Jedidiah Ezekiel.

102
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:16,660
I am from a small village in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, and I am on the Rumspringa, my ultimate quest

103
00:07:16,660 --> 00:07:18,820
to find the true meaning of partying.

104
00:07:18,820 --> 00:07:24,740
I love to have wild nights with my friends Plush and Flucklick, where we do MDMA and recreate

105
00:07:24,740 --> 00:07:29,020
various photos of Britney Spears leaving limos without any underpants on.

106
00:07:29,020 --> 00:07:30,020
Ultimate cool.

107
00:07:30,020 --> 00:07:35,380
I'm here to be sexy singles and find love, or overdose before I turn 21 and have to mow

108
00:07:35,380 --> 00:07:37,020
corn again.

109
00:07:37,020 --> 00:07:38,020
One fact about me?

110
00:07:38,020 --> 00:07:41,780
I go both ways, but I prefer girls about 60/40.

111
00:07:41,780 --> 00:07:43,440
I am a complete pusshound.

112
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:48,260
I love to eat pussy, ever since I was a child practicing on a bowl of milk.

113
00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:53,220
I have had the time of my life these past four weeks experiencing English culture, like being

114
00:07:53,220 --> 00:07:57,620
nervous that my cell phone is spying on me and forgetting about AIDS.

115
00:07:57,620 --> 00:08:02,060
I don't remember how I got here, and I don't know where I'm going, but I have a feeling

116
00:08:02,060 --> 00:08:06,260
we're going to discover the true meaning of friendship.

117
00:08:06,260 --> 00:08:10,180
So, alright.

118
00:08:10,180 --> 00:08:12,940
You all wake up in this room.

119
00:08:12,940 --> 00:08:15,220
You're all naked.

120
00:08:15,220 --> 00:08:22,200
all have those metal collars around your neck and these tiny little penis collars

121
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:28,680
around your penises and your tiny little peepees. Alec Wahlberg you try to pull at

122
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:33,960
the chain and as you do you feel the ring around your peepee grow a little bit

123
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:43,880
tighter and start to prick the skin. Yeah you stop pulling. Michael

124
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:47,760
dangerous you shoot right up when you hear that stop quietly whispering to

125
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:51,520
yourself and the first thing you see for some reason is a clock on the wall

126
00:08:51,520 --> 00:09:02,640
opposite you it says it's midnight you all look around and see you're sitting

127
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:06,000
in a circle a large circle and in the middle of you seems to be a large

128
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:10,400
gruesome looking pole as you all begin to stand up each of your chains makes a

129
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:13,760
jangling sound as they yank down your peepee.

130
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:17,000
Suddenly music starts to come from somewhere.

131
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,640
Maybe the floor, maybe from speakers.

132
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:22,320
It's getting louder and louder until it's almost deafening.

133
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:26,600
It's "You Spin Me Round" right around by Dead or Alive.

134
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:28,720
And as each of you try to plug your ears,

135
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:31,080
you feel airpods inside of them.

136
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:32,800
Dieter, you try to pull them out and realize

137
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:36,040
they are glued in, hot glued in.

138
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:39,240
Suddenly, a voice comes through each of your AirPods.

139
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:41,880
"Hello, gentlemen.

140
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:44,240
Seems you're in quite the pickle.

141
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:47,160
Let's play with some toys.

142
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:50,160
You are all selfish loners,

143
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:52,160
who play by your own rules.

144
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:56,120
But what happens when you have to submit your will to someone else and work as a team,

145
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:58,480
or else you bleed to death from your pee-pee?

146
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:00,960
This is the first of my many tests,

147
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:02,680
to see what three men such as your-"

148
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:04,880
"Bull-"

149
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:06,800
Who's that guy?

150
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:09,800
Who the fuck is that you hear back away from the speaker?

151
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:11,800
Who the fuck is that?

152
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:13,800
No, the fucking, the Amish speaker.

153
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:14,800
What's up?

154
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:15,800
Who the fuck?

155
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:16,800
Who are you?

156
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:18,800
I'm just happy to be here.

157
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:19,800
But...

158
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:22,800
Okay, um...

159
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:26,800
So, I didn't prepare anything for you, I don't really know who you are.

160
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:27,800
I'm really sorry.

161
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:30,800
I'm the life of the party, baby.

162
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,800
Tell me something!

163
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:45,800
I can tell. I'm a big boy.

164
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:55,160
life or not. Okay. Um, well the four of you have all done something terrible, probably. Something

165
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:59,560
you cannot forgive yourselves for. Something that proves that you don't know how to live the mass.

166
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:05,080
I'll let you all figure that out for yourselves while you're here. What you could have done

167
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:10,840
differently, but first you must make it out of this room alive. Before you is a maypole I stole

168
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:15,320
when the carnival came into town three and a half months ago. I've since smothered it in shit and

169
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:21,480
blood mostly mine and attached it not colorful ribbons but horrible drab chains. Each of those

170
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:25,880
chains has a mechanism tied to the base of your peepees that locks the chains to your peepees.

171
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:31,320
If one of you pulls with too much force the mechanism will squeeze off all of your peepees,

172
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:34,280
the door will lock and you will be left to bleed out from your peepees.

173
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:39,800
If you walk to your left or to your right a mechanism will shift atop of the maypole and

174
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:43,000
you will begin to pull the other members of your group with you in the direction you choose by

175
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:48,280
their peepees. If you do so too fast, you may trigger the mechanism attached to your peepee,

176
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:52,440
not only for yourself but for the others with you, and all your peepees will get snatched right off.

177
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:59,080
However, if you walk in a slow circle, in the correct direction, you just may be able to undo

178
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:06,600
the mechanism and free your peepees. Try to work as a team, while this song, "Dead or Alive" plays

179
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:12,680
too loud for you to hear anything or communicate with one another. Live mas or die, the choice is

180
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:20,160
yours. And you hear the Taco Bell bong ring and the voice cuts out. And so you are all

181
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:27,640
in this room. There is what he described it. There's a maypole in the middle of it. There's

182
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:33,720
chains attached to all your peepees. And you have to find a way to undo this mechanism so

183
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:40,560
you can leave the room. You can't hear each other. You have to, you're going to have to

184
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:47,500
make gestures, probably, and convincing looks using any tools you have, anything you see

185
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:52,580
on the ground around you to try to communicate the ideas you have to one another.

186
00:12:52,580 --> 00:12:53,580
I start dancing.

187
00:12:53,580 --> 00:13:01,720
I look at Caleb right in the face and I just start pointing at my penis.

188
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:05,440
When you paused I thought you were going to say my character name.

189
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:06,440
Yeah, me too.

190
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:07,440
I didn't say my name.

191
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:12,080
But then I look at Jedidiah and I start pointing at my penis and I'm screaming.

192
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:13,080
Oh yeah!

193
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:18,320
I know what that is!

194
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:20,040
I know what you're saying to me!

195
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:25,040
And so I jump on the pole and start doing Demi Moore's striptease.

196
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:26,040
Okay.

197
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:32,440
I'm just wiggling my toes and gliding my finger over the contraption on my penis.

198
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:35,440
You're all gonna die.

199
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:42,960
I start running around the pole.

200
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:45,400
Okay, okay, okay.

201
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:48,800
Alright, you all feel yourselves get tugged.

202
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:51,600
Wait, which direction do you run in?

203
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:52,600
Counterclockwise.

204
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:58,680
Okay, you all are start getting dragged by your peepees.

205
00:13:58,680 --> 00:13:59,680
Counterclockwise.

206
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:00,680
Oh yeah!

207
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:01,680
Woo!

208
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:02,680
Um, okay.

209
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:05,680
You all take four damage.

210
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:06,680
Oh my gosh.

211
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:07,680
He's going to fast.

212
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:08,680
Man.

213
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:09,680
Patrick.

214
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:10,680
This is like a Prince Albert.

215
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:13,680
Do you want to continue to run or do you want to slow down?

216
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:15,680
No, I stop dead in my tracks.

217
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:16,680
Okay.

218
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:17,680
Okay.

219
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:22,680
I start slowly crip walking counterclockwise.

220
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:23,680
Okay.

221
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:26,680
The chains are to pull at you guys.

222
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:28,680
Do you want to follow that motion?

223
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:30,680
counterclockwise, I'm going with it.

224
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:31,680
Okay.

225
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:32,680
I'm also going with it.

226
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:34,680
But if it was clockwise, there would be an issue.

227
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:37,680
If it was clockwise, we'd be having a whole different conversation.

228
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:38,680
Yeah.

229
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:39,680
Okay.

230
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:41,680
And so, if you do that, you all do that.

231
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:42,680
You're all doing it.

232
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:44,680
Okay, you're all tripwalking counterclockwise, very slowly.

233
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:45,680
I never said I was tripwalking.

234
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:46,680
You're all tripwalking.

235
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:48,680
I never claimed it.

236
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:53,680
I'm like imitating what Cameron's doing, but it's very clear that I don't know what's going on.

237
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:57,680
So it's kind of like a fake tripwalk.

238
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:02,680
I'm moving like an emaciated guy who just found gold.

239
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:07,680
I don't know what the reference point is, but you know what I'm talking about.

240
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:09,680
Yeah, I think so.

241
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:16,680
So you're all bleeding a little bit from your penises, and kind of crip-walking slowly counter-clockwise.

242
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:19,680
You do this for about a minute, and...

243
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:21,680
[click]

244
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:22,680
It unlocks.

245
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:24,680
The Puppies unlock.

246
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:29,760
The door you see the door and below the clock that is that

247
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:36,200
Michael dangerous was facing and you see like a metal sheet in front of it shoot up and

248
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:41,280
You hear a voice in your head. You hear the song start to turn down said

249
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:47,880
Okay, when he started to dance like a stripper, I was I thought I had you there, but um, you figured it out

250
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:50,520
So I guess on to the next room

251
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:53,720
You're welcome boys

252
00:15:53,720 --> 00:16:06,160

253
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:19,080
on

254
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:25,560
All right, I think I'm gonna keep them in though. Well, no, no, you could roll a constitution saving throw if you want to take those out

255
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:27,560
All right, constitution check really? Yeah

256
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:33,200
Okay, yeah you take them out there's scarring

257
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:39,400
But you don't take any damage you're you're able you're you're you're Irish Boston Irish strength

259
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:47,040

Okay, okay, he's not even fucking real app. Oh, no, I got a six Dieter Dieter. You're fine

261
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:57,160

262
00:16:57,160 --> 00:17:03,560
Michael dangerous you're sensitive musical ears can't stand you taking them out

263
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:07,480
You take

264
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:13,580
Another two points of damage. What's your bleeding from your ears now? Oh my god. Is there a door open now?

265
00:17:13,580 --> 00:17:15,600
Yeah, the door is open on the other side

266
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:20,400
Okay, come on fellows. Let's go. Yeah, let's go through the door. All right, check it out

267
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:23,520
All right. I'll go first. I

268
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:25,680
Walk in first

269
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:27,680
Okay

00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:36,360
Who walks in first me, okay cool, this is uh, this is this one's probably the this one's should be the least dangerous

271
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:45,460
It's pretty good. Honestly. Yeah, you walk in looks like a

272
00:17:45,460 --> 00:17:50,040
Just looks like a karaoke room in k-town

273
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:58,200
Fully lifted up and planted in whatever the fuck sort of construct you're in right now with couches a little karaoke machine and a TV

274
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:03,160
You hear a voice over the loudspeaker

In front of you is a state-of-the-art sound beast Pegasus karaoke machine and portable PA speaker system for kids and adults

279
00:18:29,460 --> 00:18:33,700
However, the only songs on there all have the n-word in them

280
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:47,280
our fact and you are currently being live streamed on jib jab.com to 37 36 back to 37 viewers

281
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:52,420
you could pick any song you like but for each word you get each note off key the colors

282
00:18:52,420 --> 00:18:56,420
that are around each of your necks will tighten further and if you miss any n words your heads

283
00:18:56,420 --> 00:18:58,420
will be cut completely off.

284
00:18:58,420 --> 00:19:00,420
[laughter]

285
00:19:00,420 --> 00:19:02,420
Oh no. Michael Baydress.

286
00:19:02,420 --> 00:19:04,420
I say the N-word.

287
00:19:04,420 --> 00:19:06,420
[laughter]

288
00:19:06,420 --> 00:19:08,420
[laughter]

289
00:19:08,420 --> 00:19:10,420
I immediately

290
00:19:10,420 --> 00:19:12,420
also say it.

291
00:19:12,420 --> 00:19:14,420
[laughter]

292
00:19:14,420 --> 00:19:16,420
Oh, okay, well, this wasn't even

293
00:19:16,420 --> 00:19:18,420
addressed to you two, so this, I mean,

294
00:19:18,420 --> 00:19:20,420
great. Good for you.

295
00:19:20,420 --> 00:19:22,420
[laughter]

296
00:19:22,420 --> 00:19:24,420
Add that to a list of reasons why I feel

297
00:19:24,420 --> 00:19:31,140
Justified having you all in here, but but hold on okay, Michael dangerous your career is on the line

298
00:19:31,140 --> 00:19:35,960
This is live streaming on jib jab calm I say it again

299
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:40,980
Because I'm gonna get taken down

300
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:45,380
If you keep doing that they're gonna flag it

301
00:19:45,380 --> 00:19:48,100
We're up to 30 and one more time

302
00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:53,300
Wait guys if they have to flag the live stream, then this trap doesn't work

303
00:19:53,300 --> 00:19:55,300
I

304
00:19:55,300 --> 00:19:59,820
Do not do this I'm not saying it I'm saying new ones

305
00:19:59,820 --> 00:20:04,940
I'm saying antiquated

306
00:20:04,940 --> 00:20:12,740
They're only Boston guys no, can you get out? Can you get on he's taking to somebody else you get on that shit

307
00:20:12,740 --> 00:20:16,340
Okay

308
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:19,100
Okay, the live stream is down so

309
00:20:19,100 --> 00:20:21,340
Okay

310
00:20:21,340 --> 00:20:24,060
That doesn't mean you get out of the room yet, okay?

311
00:20:24,060 --> 00:20:28,860
Okay, that doesn't mean you get out of the room.

312
00:20:28,860 --> 00:20:33,180
You still have to do one more thing. I'd say it again.

313
00:20:33,180 --> 00:20:36,940
I'd also say it again. I think that it's the only way out now.

314
00:20:36,940 --> 00:20:42,980
I started dancing to their chorus of N-Words like it's Depeche Mode.

315
00:20:42,980 --> 00:20:47,220
Yeah, we're saying it to the tune of Personal Jesus.

316
00:20:47,220 --> 00:20:51,380
Yeah, we're holding hands and running in a circle.

317
00:20:51,380 --> 00:20:57,220
This is not this is not OK.

318
00:20:57,220 --> 00:20:59,700
I'm from Boston. What do you fucking expect?

319
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:00,980
I didn't. Well, I would.

320
00:21:00,980 --> 00:21:05,020
This was for so as I was explaining, this was for Michael Dangerous.

321
00:21:05,020 --> 00:21:08,580
OK, where if he said and then where he is, might have difficulty getting hired.

322
00:21:08,580 --> 00:21:10,340
Right. If it gets live stream.

323
00:21:10,340 --> 00:21:13,180
But now he doesn't have to worry about that because it's been taken down.

324
00:21:13,180 --> 00:21:14,300
I don't know how long it's been.

325
00:21:14,300 --> 00:21:17,660
You know how long it took me to get a license to do that on jibjab.com?

326
00:21:17,660 --> 00:21:19,660
Do you know how...

327
00:21:19,660 --> 00:21:21,820
they make that so difficult?

328
00:21:21,820 --> 00:21:24,540
To stream like three hours a week.

329
00:21:24,540 --> 00:21:26,700
It's so hard to do.

330
00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:28,940
A fucking jibjab?

331
00:21:28,940 --> 00:21:32,940
I'm up behind the TV trying to change the input seeing if there's a

332
00:21:32,940 --> 00:21:35,100
PlayStation connected.

333
00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:40,780
No, stop. There's nothing else. It is a red, yellow, green TV. There's no

334
00:21:40,780 --> 00:21:42,780

okay

356
00:22:28,020 --> 00:22:29,700
michael dangerous

357
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:33,040
you spent your life impersonating a rap rock artist

358
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:36,040
never fully committing to either rap or rock

359
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:39,220
to the life of a real rock star and most importantly

360
00:22:39,220 --> 00:22:42,860
never committing to the responsibilities of being a father

361
00:22:42,860 --> 00:22:43,900
became are you just

362
00:22:43,900 --> 00:22:47,180
there was other stuff you were gonna have to do but now

363
00:22:47,180 --> 00:22:50,120
okay

364
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:52,140
you let your child die

365
00:22:52,140 --> 00:22:55,260
by getting into some poison energy drink

366
00:22:55,260 --> 00:22:57,800
no it wasn't my fault

367
00:22:57,800 --> 00:22:59,460
it was your fault

368
00:22:59,460 --> 00:23:03,100
yeah it was

369
00:23:03,100 --> 00:23:07,220
we flash back

370
00:23:07,220 --> 00:23:08,300
to

371
00:23:08,300 --> 00:23:11,420
what's what michael dangerous described to me what happened how did this happen

372
00:23:11,420 --> 00:23:13,900
to you yes so

373
00:23:13,900 --> 00:23:15,780
uh... i was just

374
00:23:15,780 --> 00:23:18,540
i was just getting into the

375
00:23:18,540 --> 00:23:22,100
the impersonator business i was just finally hitting it big

376
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:25,660
and i've made enough money that i didn't have to worry we i didn't have to worry

377
00:23:25,660 --> 00:23:27,220
about

378
00:23:27,220 --> 00:23:30,500
about get put it food on the table anymore everything i know you can learn

379
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:33,460
well you know you're me i'm your manager michael you know i think it's good you

380
00:23:33,460 --> 00:23:38,240
doing amazing work okay everybody loves your impersonations the children love it

381
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:41,280
They don't even know who Fred Durst is, but they love you.

382
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:42,440
You are killing it.

383
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:47,440
- They're just drawn to my groovy style and hip hop rapping.

384
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:48,440
- That's right.

385
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:53,240
- It's a timeless combination of heavy guitars

386
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:55,920
and socially conscious lyrics.

387
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:58,480
(laughing)

388
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:00,640
- Like I said, you stick to that Wikipedia entry

389
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:02,600
and you're gonna go places, okay?

390
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:04,280
It's incredible.

391
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:07,460
Now, I am a little concerned because I remember

392
00:24:07,460 --> 00:24:11,460
you used to have a son you would bring around. I was just wondering where he's at.

393
00:24:11,460 --> 00:24:16,900
As a friend, I know you're a manager and I know I get 90% of the cut, but as a friend,

394
00:24:16,900 --> 00:24:19,500
I want to know how your son is doing.

395
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:27,580
Okay, so then we cut back, we cut to the dangerous household where my 29-year-old son, Ben Stiller

396
00:24:27,580 --> 00:24:34,620
Dangerous, is just kind of sitting around watching TV. He's sitting there and his stomach

397
00:24:34,620 --> 00:24:38,780
starts growling and he goes, "Hmm, I could really go to eat or drink something right now."

398
00:24:38,780 --> 00:24:44,540
And he gets up and he goes to the kitchen and he sees a blender sitting on the table filled with a

399
00:24:44,540 --> 00:24:52,700
mysterious but delicious looking and smelling liquid that's labeled the hot dog flavored water.

400
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:57,900
This is an experimental energy drink that I've been developing for some time, but he doesn't

401
00:24:57,900 --> 00:25:03,500
know that. And he sees it, he walks up to it and he takes a big swig and just like that, a

402
00:25:04,140 --> 00:25:10,140
blood vessel in his brain explodes and he collapses dead on the ground because I wasn't there to stop

403
00:25:10,140 --> 00:25:18,540
him. And Michael Dangerous, the concert you were playing at, I believe it was for a Wahlbergers

404
00:25:18,540 --> 00:25:26,700
Rio opening, right? It was, yes. So this isn't... The Wahlbergers at the LAX airport?

405
00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:31,580
Yeah, you were there, you were running that show. What was that like, Alec Wahlberg,

406
00:25:31,580 --> 00:25:35,340
that Michael is playing. It was great they didn't let me out.

407
00:25:35,340 --> 00:25:41,420
They didn't let me out of the back. I had to do all the fucking dishes and stuff.

408
00:25:41,420 --> 00:25:47,100
Basically I was the only one there. I was the only chef in the kitchen. I was

409
00:25:47,100 --> 00:25:50,940
doing the dishes. I was making all the burgers.

410
00:25:50,940 --> 00:25:56,940
It was very fulfilling work. And before we continue on with that,

411
00:25:56,940 --> 00:26:00,780
with the rest of his storyline, we're gonna back out and back into the room

412
00:26:00,780 --> 00:26:07,900
here. Michael Dangerous, you let your child die. Now, so originally I had written here

413
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:11,820
that if you don't fully commit to the songs, you know, in the machine, now you

414
00:26:11,820 --> 00:26:14,540
won't fully commit because the idea would be to make you say the word but

415
00:26:14,540 --> 00:26:22,100
that's not up. So now what I need you to do is answer five questions about your

416
00:26:22,100 --> 00:26:29,620
son who you know so little about with the help of your friends. This is gonna be

417
00:26:29,620 --> 00:26:30,620
Easy!

418
00:26:30,620 --> 00:26:35,820
If you get three out of the five of them right, you pass.

419
00:26:35,820 --> 00:26:43,220
And you're able to- that's 60% which is passing in jigsaw school.

420
00:26:43,220 --> 00:26:46,100
If you don't, then you, you know, you're fucked.

421
00:26:46,100 --> 00:26:47,100
So.

422
00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:54,620
And so the way I want to do this is, you all, I mean, you all can like, can help or whatever

423
00:26:54,620 --> 00:26:56,860
in however way you want to help.

424
00:26:56,860 --> 00:27:07,140
But you're the only one, Michael, who remembers, knows anything about your son.

425
00:27:07,140 --> 00:27:10,420
So what you're going to do for each of these questions if you want to, is roll a history

426
00:27:10,420 --> 00:27:11,420
check.

427
00:27:11,420 --> 00:27:12,420
It's one of the things you can do.

428
00:27:12,420 --> 00:27:19,900
And depending on the success of that, will determine how good of a hint you get, basically.

429
00:27:19,900 --> 00:27:25,240
Likewise, all of you can look around the room, see if there's any clues from Michael's life,

430
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:30,840
things like that to see if you can figure out how to help him.

431
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:36,860
But yeah, if you get this wrong, it's game over for you only.

432
00:27:36,860 --> 00:27:42,680
The other one was going to be for everybody, but you guys undid that, which was smart.

433
00:27:42,680 --> 00:27:44,560
Because I opened the door for that.

434
00:27:44,560 --> 00:27:47,160
I used a very smart strategy on that one.

435
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:49,320
The smartest strategy we could.

436
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:53,160
You use that strategy many times.

437
00:27:53,160 --> 00:28:05,080
So um, so suddenly you hear out of the karaoke machine a woman's voice.

438
00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:07,960
What was your son's favorite color?

439
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:14,760
One, red, blue, green, or whatever dad I liked.

440
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:16,320
Brown?

441
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:19,000
Was it brown?

442
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:20,000
Roll roll you can roll history.

443
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,040
I'm rolling a history check.

444
00:28:22,040 --> 00:28:24,000
uh... so it's a net twenty

445
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,800
we have to learn around the room

446
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:29,360
to why just let me know if you got it right okay you got it perfect yet net

447
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:30,560
twenty uh...

448
00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:32,080
you remember it was green

449
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:33,600
he was a green

450
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:35,800
he loved green

451
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:39,540
that's why he tried to create energy drink

452
00:28:39,540 --> 00:28:42,280
that is correct

453
00:28:42,280 --> 00:28:44,440
next question

454
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:46,680
who was your son's best friend

455
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:48,680
she your neighbor

456
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:50,740
sherry's dog leopold

457
00:28:51,740 --> 00:29:03,640
or Frank McNamara I'm thinking of myself and I'm mumbling Milhouse I feel

458
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:11,420
like it is on the tip of my tongue god I got another cricket it's Sherry's dog

459
00:29:11,420 --> 00:29:14,700
Leopold you remember seeing him play with the dog what the fuck it was

460
00:29:14,700 --> 00:29:21,700
"It's Sherry's dog Leopold! I remember seeing him play with the dog! What the fuck?"

461
00:29:21,700 --> 00:29:22,700
Okay.

462
00:29:22,700 --> 00:29:24,700
Ding ding ding!

463
00:29:24,700 --> 00:29:26,700
That is correct.

464
00:29:26,700 --> 00:29:31,700
I'm the smartest guy alive when it comes to my dead son.

465
00:29:31,700 --> 00:29:32,700
Next question.

466
00:29:32,700 --> 00:29:36,700
I think that we're about to leave.

467
00:29:36,700 --> 00:29:39,700
I saw you cheering.

468
00:29:39,700 --> 00:29:48,540
when your son did his silly dance was he hungry tired horny or wanted to talk

469
00:29:48,540 --> 00:29:58,100
about his pill addiction problem that was a for that role that's no good

470
00:29:58,100 --> 00:30:01,300
your son would do is silly dance and then and it was just kind of

471
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:04,300
impenetrable to you just kind of what are you doing

472
00:30:04,300 --> 00:30:06,300
I don't really get this.

473
00:30:06,300 --> 00:30:08,300
It was when he was hungry!

474
00:30:08,300 --> 00:30:10,300
*laughs*

475
00:30:10,300 --> 00:30:12,300
*fart noise*

476
00:30:12,300 --> 00:30:14,300
That is incorrect. He did it when he was tired.

477
00:30:14,300 --> 00:30:16,300
You're wrong!

478
00:30:16,300 --> 00:30:18,300
No, no, no she's not.

479
00:30:18,300 --> 00:30:20,300
Can we get a fact check on this one?

480
00:30:20,300 --> 00:30:22,300
Please don't. You can't get a fact check on it.

481
00:30:22,300 --> 00:30:24,300
Okay, sorry!

482
00:30:24,300 --> 00:30:26,300
Okay, next question.

483
00:30:26,300 --> 00:30:28,300
*speaks Japanese*

484
00:30:28,300 --> 00:30:30,300
*laughs*

485
00:30:30,300 --> 00:30:32,300
*speaks Japanese*

486
00:30:32,300 --> 00:30:39,300
The machine's playing it in reverse!

487
00:30:39,300 --> 00:30:43,300
Or, Monster Energy Otter Juice Chaos.

488
00:30:43,300 --> 00:30:48,300
I'm sorry, that one was in Japanese and I couldn't fix that one.

489
00:30:48,300 --> 00:30:51,300
I kicked the machine.

490
00:30:51,300 --> 00:30:54,300
Yeah.

491
00:30:54,300 --> 00:30:58,300
I tried to do a Fonzie to it.

Do I roll a Japanese check on this one?

496
00:31:27,340 --> 00:31:29,900
Yeah, you can roll a Japanese dice.

497
00:31:29,900 --> 00:31:31,340
I got a 16.

498
00:31:31,340 --> 00:31:32,700
You can roll what you can do.

499
00:31:32,700 --> 00:31:37,340
Well, also, like, you have Amish magics too, Caleb.

500
00:31:37,340 --> 00:31:38,620
So...

501
00:31:38,620 --> 00:31:39,580
Okay, this is new.

502
00:31:39,580 --> 00:31:40,720
Yeah.

503
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:43,260
I guess I haven't looked at any of my abilities.

504
00:31:43,260 --> 00:31:47,580
Yeah, so what that means is, there's a...

505
00:31:47,580 --> 00:31:50,540
Basically, you have 10 uses of Amish magics throughout this campaign,

506
00:31:52,460 --> 00:31:58,060
Which allows you to cast a random spell from a table of Amish spells on your solid stone tablet. I have the spell table

507
00:31:58,060 --> 00:32:00,700
Um, you basically pray

508
00:32:00,700 --> 00:32:02,380
add religion

509
00:32:02,380 --> 00:32:08,140
And if you get 20 you get to pick a spell from the list 15 to 19 something helpful 11 to 14 something somewhat helpful

510
00:32:08,140 --> 00:32:10,300
6 to 10 somewhat unhelpful

511
00:32:10,300 --> 00:32:15,500
Uh, two to five somewhat something harmful one you begin to transform into the humble chicken

512
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:17,820
Okay

513
00:32:17,820 --> 00:32:23,800
uh... i'd just remember that i have a homage magics and then i i i wrote him

514
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:28,100
which i wrote this in the time of all religion and make your prayer ok

515
00:32:28,100 --> 00:32:31,540
hold on i have to pray

516
00:32:31,540 --> 00:32:33,040
that in a year twenty four

517
00:32:33,040 --> 00:32:35,460
you know i was really managed

518
00:32:35,460 --> 00:32:39,300
it's on the a always with advantage but you take the first number uh...

519
00:32:39,300 --> 00:32:41,260
or yeah

520
00:32:41,260 --> 00:32:45,020
so something somewhat harmful when we look at your spell table

521
00:32:45,020 --> 00:32:48,160
what do you say what do you say to your god we ask of him

522
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:50,800
dear all i do know how it

523
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:52,100
what

524
00:32:52,100 --> 00:32:55,660
can you please please have jet is not a good idea which for

525
00:32:55,660 --> 00:32:59,180
yeah okay i wrote a tackle

526
00:32:59,180 --> 00:33:00,140
okay

527
00:33:00,140 --> 00:33:04,080
which is saying the wrong name of the wrong god

528
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:07,620
is my homage magic's again to defend myself from uh...

529
00:33:07,620 --> 00:33:10,960
dean urdine peace pitchfork

530
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:12,440
the

531
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:15,200
and that's a that's gonna definitely you

532
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:17,040
but all that's all prayer

533
00:33:17,040 --> 00:33:18,800
for a lot of tears

534
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:22,840
and then my god you thought a ok ok so i need to resolve a few things

535
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:26,400
so first of all something somewhat harmful has to happen

536
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:28,560
so uh...

537
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:29,640
okay

538
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:33,960
uh... you create a bonfire in the middle of the room

539
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:36,160
that uh...

540
00:33:36,160 --> 00:33:38,440
that uh... if you get anywhere near it

541
00:33:38,440 --> 00:33:42,920
uh... you're going to light on fire you're gonna take some fire damage

542
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:43,960
the one second

543
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:45,160
i have a

544
00:33:45,160 --> 00:33:46,780
i think this is a good thing

545
00:33:46,780 --> 00:33:47,780
it could be good

546
00:33:47,780 --> 00:33:48,800
yeah

547
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:50,060
uh...

548
00:33:50,060 --> 00:33:51,460
now

549
00:33:51,460 --> 00:33:55,320
that's all that happens when you pray now next that happens is deter stabs you

550
00:33:55,320 --> 00:33:56,640
with a pitchfork

551
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:57,500
uh...

552
00:33:57,500 --> 00:33:58,820
tries but

553
00:33:58,820 --> 00:34:00,480
with that nineteen

554
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:01,140
uh...

555
00:34:01,140 --> 00:34:01,960
you

556
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:03,360

558
00:34:05,280 --> 00:34:07,800
to make sure i got this right

559
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:11,480
Okay, yeah with that 19 you accident you accidentally

560
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:13,800
Uh give the ability

561
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:19,080
to uh, you you cast comprehend languages on um, cameron on uh, uh

On um, uh, alec not alec. Fuck. What are your names? Michael dangerous?

563
00:34:25,160 --> 00:34:30,600
But you still get stabbed with the pitchfork. So do damage. Uh, oh my god

564
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:40,060
Hey, hey pagan piece of shit, just hit pitchfork in the in the chat. Fuck you

565
00:34:40,060 --> 00:34:47,040
So early

566
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:57,400
But you could understand the language

567
00:34:57,400 --> 00:34:59,400
I was just trying to nip ya.

568
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:01,400
I was just trying to nip ya.

569
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:03,400
I was just trying to nip ya.

570
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:05,400
You're gonna kill me so early.

571
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:07,400
But now you understand the language much more dangerous.

572
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:09,400
What's it saying?

573
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:11,400
The question is, what was your son's favorite food?

574
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:13,400
And we have a 5.

575
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:19,400
Apple, soup, tongue, or monster energy, ultra drink, and ultra juiced chaos.

576
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:21,400
Can I roll history now?

577
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:23,400
Yeah.

578
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:25,400
I'll say with advantage because now you understand the language.

579
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:37,680
is

580
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:39,680
with the monster energy option.

581
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:43,680
Ding ding ding ding ding ding!

582
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:45,680
You are correct.

583
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:49,680
Um, yeah, and with that, the door opens.

584
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:51,680
You've completed the next puzzle.

585
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:53,680
Let's fucking go, dude.

586
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:57,680
Let's fucking go. Boston fucking strong. Let's go.

587
00:35:57,680 --> 00:35:59,680
Okay, yeah. You can all walk.

588
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:01,680
Caleb, how much HP do you have left?

589
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:03,680
I have 14 HP.

590
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:06,680
He's kind of beefy. He's like a beefy omelette.

591

Yeah, I have 14 too.

592
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:12,240
beefy. Can I give Caleb a kiss on his wound because I feel so bad? Yeah, you can do whatever you want.

593
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:19,080
Oh yeah. Alright, come over here. I forgive you. Let me see if I can't tongue kiss you back to

Absolutely

I accept. I accept.

631
00:38:35,300 --> 00:38:38,300
Oh, we all have another wedding in this one?

00:38:38,300 --> 00:38:39,300
Yeah.

633
00:38:39,300 --> 00:38:40,800
I decline.

634
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:44,800
Yeah, you go to the next room.

635
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:47,300
Wait, does Caleb get healed at all?

636
00:38:47,300 --> 00:38:49,300
Yeah, he healed 3 HP.

637
00:38:49,300 --> 00:38:50,300
Oh, okay, cool.

638
00:38:50,300 --> 00:38:51,800
You go into the next room.

639
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:59,400
And you notice, you know, you walk in, the first thing you notice is the change in air pressure.

640
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:05,160
And your stomach starts to drop. The room resembles the inside of an airplane.

641
00:39:05,160 --> 00:39:07,080
A very particular airplane.

642
00:39:07,080 --> 00:39:13,240
Looking behind you, you still see the door to the other room, but when you look to the window,

643
00:39:13,240 --> 00:39:16,520
it appears you're tearing through the sky. In front of you are people.

644
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:19,400
I start screaming and holding my ears with both hands.

645
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:22,120
I put the AirPods back in.

646
00:39:22,120 --> 00:39:29,120
I'm doing the the the safety presentation with the seat belt at the front of the plane.

647
00:39:29,120 --> 00:39:36,120
In front of you are people appearing to enact their final moments aboard the plane.

648
00:39:36,120 --> 00:39:43,120
Couples like holding each other, the men of the cloth taking their final vows, children crying.

649
00:39:43,120 --> 00:39:46,120
The sound of this commotion is overwhelming.

650
00:39:46,120 --> 00:39:51,760
Overwhelming as you get closer to the people though you realize that they are just corpses animated by puppet strings

651
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:58,880
And that there is just the audio coming from somewhere else and as they make their motions gross blood and viscera squirt out of them

652
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:01,880
Up ahead you see the culprits

653
00:40:01,880 --> 00:40:03,220
three terrorists

654
00:40:03,220 --> 00:40:07,520
With no further description necessary to clarify what they look like what they believe in

655
00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:11,620
What the United States did to their country to get them so riled up in the first place?

656
00:40:11,620 --> 00:40:18,700
Oh my god, I know what this is supposed to be. This is that terrorist attack that destroyed the set of the music video for Roland

657
00:40:18,700 --> 00:40:22,700
No, this is the soul plane

658
00:40:22,700 --> 00:40:28,540
Just go dancing down the aisle

659
00:40:28,540 --> 00:40:36,060
You could make it more obvious see there's a black guy

660
00:40:36,060 --> 00:40:47,260
I

661
00:40:47,260 --> 00:40:59,260
black exploitation films I feel like no he wasn't in Soul Plane. Racist! He's a white guy. Racist!

662
00:40:59,260 --> 00:41:10,140
This is your captain speaking. Let's play with some toys. Alec Wahlberg, growing up you were

663
00:41:10,140 --> 00:41:15,420
always the underdog, taking the fall for your brothers various hate crimes and raising many

664
00:41:15,420 --> 00:41:19,980
of their illegitimate children until they were around three and could forage for their own food

665
00:41:19,980 --> 00:41:26,140
as is Boston Irish custom. It wasn't an easy life but it was one you should have appreciated more.

666
00:41:26,140 --> 00:41:31,020
You still got to be the real turtle's footstool that one time he couldn't reach the guitar hero

667
00:41:31,020 --> 00:41:36,140
controller. You get free Guinness, the worst fucking beer in the world, in every bar. Take

668
00:41:36,140 --> 00:41:41,980
that back! Take that fucking back dude! I won't. Take that back! Fucking sucks. Take that back

669
00:41:41,980 --> 00:41:48,640
That's everybody who's listening to this if you drink Guinness and you're like mmm yummy fucking sucks. It's a dinner be a dude

670
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:57,140
Drink it and you eat it you drink it for dinner. No you drink it at dinner. You don't you don't drink it all the time

671
00:41:57,140 --> 00:42:01,860
Oh, well, yeah, that's what I was doing wrong because I was drinking Guinness all the time instead of just

672
00:42:01,860 --> 00:42:05,220
Fucking do it wrong

673
00:42:05,220 --> 00:42:11,060
At one time you shot a bow and arrow into a cop car and only had to pay a $40 fine because the officer was a huge

674
00:42:11,060 --> 00:42:14,060
fan of we own the night. Alec.

675
00:42:14,060 --> 00:42:24,060
[Laughter]

676
00:42:24,060 --> 00:42:25,060
Alright.

677
00:42:25,060 --> 00:42:30,060
[Laughter]

678
00:42:30,060 --> 00:42:31,060
Sorry.

679
00:42:31,060 --> 00:42:33,060
It's okay, you made me laugh, so.

680
00:42:33,060 --> 00:42:36,060
To appreciate the Wahlberg lifestyle you were afforded,

681
00:42:36,060 --> 00:42:39,060
this constant chip on your shoulder only increased your anger

682
00:42:39,060 --> 00:42:44,500
anger and culminated in an act of heinous violence on an unsuspecting Asian man.

683
00:42:44,500 --> 00:42:49,180
Forgetting which one of "those guys" you were supposed to hate, you put one of your

684
00:42:49,180 --> 00:42:53,940
pubes in the wall burger of a Tibetan monk visiting Boston to get catfished by a 300-pound

685
00:42:53,940 --> 00:42:57,180
whale with the most busted face you've ever seen.

699
00:43:42,820 --> 00:43:44,980

700
00:43:44,980 --> 00:43:49,220

Don't know the fucking dial wet

708
00:44:26,940 --> 00:44:30,220
Shit's too hot here at that point

709
00:44:30,220 --> 00:44:35,620
Uh, we got the air conditioner on or something, please you see mark you know what you see marky mark bust in

710
00:44:35,620 --> 00:44:39,460
Through the kitchen door and he says Alec what's going on over there?

711
00:44:39,460 --> 00:44:49,820
People need their burgers. Okay, he's performing is reaching the crescendo. We really need those burgers are right now, okay

712
00:44:49,820 --> 00:44:54,820
I got a million fucking burgers. I gotta cook. Okay. Well you about to make it 2 million if you don't speed it up

713
00:44:54,820 --> 00:44:56,820
All right, I make 2 million burgers. I

714
00:44:56,820 --> 00:45:02,040
Have to go to wake up at 4 a.m. Okay right now, so I'm gonna go wake up at 4 a.m.

715
00:45:02,040 --> 00:45:08,880
I'll be support the troops. Are you gonna work out? You gotta support the troops. You're gonna work out

716
00:45:08,880 --> 00:45:14,300
He starts doing push-ups in the kitchen. Yeah, that's what I like to fucking see. Yeah, I know you like. Oh, yeah

717
00:45:14,300 --> 00:45:17,260
Push-ups right

718
00:45:18,020 --> 00:45:23,180
Squats do your squats. Okay. I'll sit on your shoulders. Not a problem. It's very easy for me to do squats cuz I'm Mark Wahlberg

719
00:45:23,180 --> 00:45:26,900
Yeah, let me sit on your shoulders. I didn't really apologize when I did that to that man

720
00:45:26,900 --> 00:45:34,060
When I was that you didn't have to mark you didn't have to right? Yeah, of course, you're gonna have to apologize

721
00:45:34,060 --> 00:45:40,680
All right. Look get those burgers out. Okay. All right. All right, and remember do not put your pubes in anything. Oh

722
00:45:40,680 --> 00:45:43,580
Even if they're Asian. Oh

723
00:45:44,100 --> 00:45:45,900
Oh boy.

724
00:45:45,900 --> 00:45:47,460
All right, okay, good man.

725
00:45:47,460 --> 00:45:48,860
And he walks out.

726
00:45:48,860 --> 00:45:50,660
I didn't say yes or no.

727
00:45:50,660 --> 00:45:51,500
No, you didn't.

728
00:45:51,500 --> 00:45:52,540
I said, oh boy.

729
00:45:52,540 --> 00:45:53,900
No, you didn't.

730
00:45:53,900 --> 00:45:56,860
He's remembering with you, the Saw guy, Jigsaw.

731
00:45:56,860 --> 00:46:00,180
No, you didn't say yes or no.

732
00:46:00,180 --> 00:46:01,520
What did you do next?

733
00:46:01,520 --> 00:46:04,060
This is all being remembered while there's like

734
00:46:04,060 --> 00:46:08,660
corpses dangling in the airplane and like noise everywhere.

735
00:46:08,660 --> 00:46:12,520
Well, I looked at the name on the order and obviously,

736
00:46:12,520 --> 00:46:20,640
You know you know when you know you fucking know it said it said dolly llama.

737
00:46:20,640 --> 00:46:29,180
Definitely didn't say that it's I that's look I was written in some other language I could read.

738
00:46:29,180 --> 00:46:35,020
I like how Wahlberg is looking at a name that's like vaguely Asian and it just turns into

739
00:46:35,020 --> 00:46:38,980
the Dolly Lomond.

740
00:46:38,980 --> 00:46:46,540
And right away I grab the Philips Norelco out from under the grill.

741
00:46:46,540 --> 00:46:47,540
I shave the whole.

742
00:46:47,540 --> 00:46:49,740
Is that where you keep it?

743
00:46:49,740 --> 00:46:52,060
I keep my deodorant under there too.

744
00:46:52,060 --> 00:46:57,780
I grab the Philips Norelco, I shave a big clump of pubes under the Thanksgiving burger

745
00:46:57,780 --> 00:47:06,340
that we have. The Thanksgiving burger? It's a turkey burger. It's a turkey burger with

746
00:47:06,340 --> 00:47:13,380
cranberry orange stuff on it. It's pretty good. I had it at the airport. Do you mean sweet

747
00:47:13,380 --> 00:47:22,780
potatoes? Nope. No, it's not sweet potatoes. It's a cranberry orange relish. Oh, interesting.

748
00:47:22,780 --> 00:47:23,780
Orange like the fruit?

749
00:47:23,780 --> 00:47:24,780
Orange like the fruit, yeah.

750
00:47:24,780 --> 00:47:25,780
Okay.

751
00:47:25,780 --> 00:47:26,780
Uh-huh.

752
00:47:26,780 --> 00:47:27,780
That's really exciting.

753
00:47:27,780 --> 00:47:28,780
It's good.

754
00:47:28,780 --> 00:47:30,780
Honestly, it wasn't bad.

755
00:47:30,780 --> 00:47:34,700
But then you handed that pubed burger to who?

756
00:47:34,700 --> 00:47:36,940
That poor Tibetan monk, Alan.

757
00:47:36,940 --> 00:47:39,780
And then we just partied.

758
00:47:39,780 --> 00:47:40,780
That's...

759
00:47:40,780 --> 00:47:43,700
Nothing else really happened.

760
00:47:43,700 --> 00:47:48,420
You've always wanted to be like one of your more famous brothers, not stuck behind the

761
00:47:48,420 --> 00:47:49,420
grill.

762
00:47:49,420 --> 00:47:55,500
While I'm looking at the flashback, I look at the cabin and I go, "Oh fuck, now I know

763
00:47:55,500 --> 00:47:56,500
what this is!"

764
00:47:56,500 --> 00:47:57,500
And I have another flashback.

765
00:47:57,500 --> 00:48:03,780
I have another flashback and it's a flashback to me and Mark sitting on the couch, September

766
00:48:03,780 --> 00:48:08,380
11th, 2001, in the morning, like 8.30.

767
00:48:08,380 --> 00:48:13,260
Mark nudges me and just looks at the TV and says, "I could have fucking stopped that."

768
00:48:13,260 --> 00:48:15,260
[laughter]

769
00:48:15,260 --> 00:48:17,260
And then we go back to the camp.

770
00:48:17,260 --> 00:48:19,260
[laughter]

771
00:48:19,260 --> 00:48:21,260
[clears throat]

772
00:48:21,260 --> 00:48:23,260
You've always wanted to be like your brothers.

773
00:48:23,260 --> 00:48:25,260
But consider me generous, Alec.

774
00:48:25,260 --> 00:48:27,260
I'm giving you the

775
00:48:27,260 --> 00:48:29,260
opportunity to be better than they ever were.

776
00:48:29,260 --> 00:48:31,260
You have two minutes

777
00:48:31,260 --> 00:48:33,260
to defeat the terrorist puppets in front of you

778
00:48:33,260 --> 00:48:35,260
before the plane crashes into the towers.

779
00:48:35,260 --> 00:48:37,260
Which, in this instance,

780
00:48:37,260 --> 00:48:39,260
means the release of a deadly poison

781
00:48:39,260 --> 00:48:41,260
gas that will kill you all

782
00:48:41,260 --> 00:48:48,040
in 30 seconds of breathing it in. If that happens, there are three gas masks

783
00:48:48,040 --> 00:48:54,120
hidden in the compartments above the plane seats. That means, should the gas be released,

784
00:48:54,120 --> 00:48:59,960
one of you will have to die. Stop 9/11, Alec. Do something not even Marky

785
00:48:59,960 --> 00:49:03,960
Mark was ever able to do. Live or die, the choice is yours.

786
00:49:03,960 --> 00:49:05,960
Wait, there's three? Yeah.

787
00:49:05,960 --> 00:49:09,440
Yeah, there's one guy. Who's this guy? Who's the fat guy with the

788
00:49:09,440 --> 00:49:15,340
sword. He's just also there. Okay. There's two of them. Yeah,

789
00:49:15,340 --> 00:49:19,240
there's two of them. Oh, I didn't see him. I only saw the

790
00:49:19,240 --> 00:49:26,340
top one. Okay. Yeah and also in that flashback.

791
00:49:26,340 --> 00:49:31,140
Dieter what were you doing there? Cuz now everyone was at

792
00:49:31,140 --> 00:49:35,540
the the this opening of the Wall Burgers place. What were you doing there?

793
00:49:35,540 --> 00:49:39,140
Where was it taking place? It was taking place in Boston, but

794
00:49:39,140 --> 00:49:41,140
Markybar came from LAX.

795
00:49:41,140 --> 00:49:43,140
Okay.

796
00:49:43,140 --> 00:49:45,140
Um.

797
00:49:45,140 --> 00:49:47,140
I, uh, I followed a porcupine

798
00:49:47,140 --> 00:49:49,140
into Boston.

799
00:49:49,140 --> 00:49:53,140
Uh, and, uh,

800
00:49:53,140 --> 00:49:55,140
yeah, I was, uh,

801
00:49:55,140 --> 00:49:59,140
I was in the back alley, uh,

802
00:49:59,140 --> 00:50:01,140
sniffing

803
00:50:01,140 --> 00:50:03,140
discarded abortions.

804
00:50:03,140 --> 00:50:05,140
At Walburgers.

805
00:50:07,140 --> 00:50:11,440
This is, yeah, raffling through the Wahlburgers dumpster looking for a--

806
00:50:11,440 --> 00:50:15,940
Hey man, I told you, you can't be ruffling around in here looking for abortions, okay?

807
00:50:15,940 --> 00:50:17,880
Alright, my mistake.

808
00:50:17,880 --> 00:50:18,880
And then I go, "But you also--"

809
00:50:18,880 --> 00:50:19,880
"My mistake?

810
00:50:19,880 --> 00:50:23,400
It's the third time you've done it this week, you old mistake."

811
00:50:23,400 --> 00:50:26,840
I just-- I just go back to Oklahoma.

812
00:50:26,840 --> 00:50:35,640
It's your only connection to that event.

813
00:50:35,640 --> 00:50:45,080
Yeah, all of you roll for initiative.

814
00:50:45,080 --> 00:50:50,080
You're about to fight some fucking terrorists.

815
00:50:50,080 --> 00:50:57,640
I look at all the dead bodies and I get really scared and I go, "Oh my god, I remember!"

816
00:50:57,640 --> 00:51:01,800
And then I flashback to when I watched IT Part 2 in theaters and I got really scared

817
00:51:01,800 --> 00:51:02,800
there.

818
00:51:02,800 --> 00:51:05,040
(laughing)

819
00:51:05,040 --> 00:51:06,560
- Yeah, are you there with,

820
00:51:06,560 --> 00:51:08,480
are you there like on "Rum Springa" when you do that?

821
00:51:08,480 --> 00:51:09,840
- Yeah, it was the first thing I did

822
00:51:09,840 --> 00:51:11,640
when "Rum Springa" started.

823
00:51:11,640 --> 00:51:13,200
- Okay, your friend,

824
00:51:13,200 --> 00:51:18,200
your friend Abraham is next to you.

825
00:51:18,200 --> 00:51:19,280
- Yeah.

826
00:51:19,280 --> 00:51:21,400
- I was like, oh wow, this is real scary.

827
00:51:21,400 --> 00:51:22,240
(screaming)

828
00:51:22,240 --> 00:51:24,480
(laughing)

829
00:51:24,480 --> 00:51:25,320
- Yeah.

830
00:51:25,320 --> 00:51:27,440
- You also remember there,

831
00:51:27,440 --> 00:51:30,040
you also remember every time something funny happened

832
00:51:30,040 --> 00:51:32,040
in the movie, there was a voice from the back of the theater

833
00:51:32,040 --> 00:51:34,040
going, "Yoooo!"

834
00:51:34,040 --> 00:51:36,040
[laughter]

00:53:05,840 --> 00:53:07,840
"I like eating it too, is that what you were gonna say?"

866
00:53:07,840 --> 00:53:09,840
"No, no, I was not gonna say eating poop, but I don't like doing that either."

867
00:53:09,840 --> 00:53:11,840
"You know what, this game sucks."

868
00:53:11,840 --> 00:53:13,840
"Give me another flashback, huh?"

869
00:53:13,840 --> 00:53:15,840
"That was it."

870
00:53:15,840 --> 00:53:17,840
"That's all I have."

871
00:53:17,840 --> 00:53:19,840
"I'm flashing back to a business idea I had."

872
00:53:19,840 --> 00:53:21,840
"I converted a computer to a computer."

873
00:53:21,840 --> 00:53:23,840
"I'm gonna go back to that."

874
00:53:23,840 --> 00:53:31,760
uh i convergently invented an ice cream uh substitute called worm water which is

875
00:53:31,760 --> 00:53:34,640
ground up earthworms and water that you put in the freezer

876
00:53:34,640 --> 00:53:38,160
and i was there too

877
00:53:38,160 --> 00:53:41,760
yeah and we were all there

878
00:53:41,760 --> 00:53:48,880
i i flashback i flashback to kindergarten and we're all there as baby versions of ourselves

879
00:53:50,960 --> 00:53:52,960
Yeah, wait, you all realize

880
00:53:52,960 --> 00:53:57,360
There but you never see the top of his head you never see us we're all

881
00:53:57,360 --> 00:54:02,440
We're all burying jigsaw in the sandbox

882
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:22,480
So yeah, the first person who goes in this turn order though is Jedidiah

883
00:54:22,480 --> 00:54:25,960
You've got to jump on these terrorists. Awesome

884
00:54:25,960 --> 00:54:31,960
Awesome they are not 50 feet away from you. They're all 30 feet. These two are 30 feet

885
00:54:31,960 --> 00:54:35,600
This is just the map size. I messed up so you can reach them

886
00:54:35,600 --> 00:54:42,520
Look at my powers and my ability. You also can do you can use your Amish magics as an action or

887
00:54:42,520 --> 00:54:45,240
You know move. I'm gonna keep doing that

888
00:54:45,800 --> 00:54:48,600
Yeah, okay, so you have you've used twice

889
00:54:48,600 --> 00:54:51,480
No, that's not. Oh I have

890
00:54:51,480 --> 00:54:59,440
It's a more yeah, and you just crit failed so you're going to do it again. Can I use my ability to give him a bonus?

891
00:54:59,440 --> 00:55:03,040
No because he was first in the turn order

892
00:55:03,040 --> 00:55:09,700
Did this is action you just bend the rules once no, can you let us win?

893
00:55:09,700 --> 00:55:13,320
I'm doing my best. So you

894
00:55:14,080 --> 00:55:21,340
You have begun the transform into the humble chicken. So the first thing that happens is your mouth becomes a beak

895
00:55:21,340 --> 00:55:24,280
very cool

896
00:55:24,280 --> 00:55:29,940
That's what that's what's happened. So far. You have four more times that can happen. Yeah, I just wore you

897
00:55:29,940 --> 00:55:33,320
That's all I wanted out of it. This was a

898
00:55:33,320 --> 00:55:39,280
Was our was our marriage successful or did Caleb decline the proposal I

899
00:55:40,040 --> 00:55:44,800
Said no, I think yeah. All right. I reproposed to Caleb now that he's a chicken

900
00:55:44,800 --> 00:55:50,680
I'm only the beginning stages of a chicken, but this time I accept okay, great

901
00:55:50,680 --> 00:55:53,280
Yeah, you're probably the only man that'll take me now with my beak

902
00:55:53,280 --> 00:55:56,080
It is your turn

903
00:55:56,080 --> 00:56:00,360
Michael dangerous, so you're not even gonna talk about how I got married. Okay?

904
00:56:00,360 --> 00:56:08,560
No, I wasn't sure if that was happening. Yeah, I get it. Yeah, so there's a priest no one of the core we have two minutes

905
00:56:09,440 --> 00:56:15,560
Well the corpses is a priest minutes the perfect wedding each round in combat is six seconds

906
00:56:15,560 --> 00:56:18,840
So you should be okay. We're doing a six second

907
00:56:18,840 --> 00:56:24,200
Well, I still consummate the marriage

908
00:56:24,200 --> 00:56:27,880
And one of my goals before you get married

909
00:56:27,880 --> 00:56:34,160
One of my run spring of goals was to break a Guinness World Record for so now fastest marriage will do it

910
00:56:34,160 --> 00:56:36,480
Okay. Yeah, you see a priest

911
00:56:36,480 --> 00:56:38,640
puppet string over

912
00:56:38,640 --> 00:56:42,680
He says I now pronounce you man and wife and his eyeball rolls out of his head

913
00:56:42,680 --> 00:56:54,640
Will you be my best man, okay, can you give a toast?

914
00:56:54,640 --> 00:56:58,280
To

915
00:56:58,280 --> 00:57:05,600
Jedediah Ezekiel Jedediah when I first met you I changed your penis up to a to a maple I

916
00:57:05,600 --> 00:57:08,240
Didn't realize

917
00:57:08,240 --> 00:57:15,640
I didn't realize that you were probably not a bad dude, you know, I think my assistant fucked this up

918
00:57:15,640 --> 00:57:18,000
I think I told him to get three four people and

919
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:24,180
Then I gave him a name of somebody else and then instead it brought you so I don't know if there's anyone else's name similar

920
00:57:24,180 --> 00:57:26,180
To Jedediah, but here you are

921
00:57:26,180 --> 00:57:28,420
Anyway, you seem cool

922
00:57:28,420 --> 00:57:30,520
and

923
00:57:30,520 --> 00:57:36,800
You know cheers to you. You have a minute now to get out of here before the poison gas comes but

924
00:57:36,800 --> 00:57:37,800
it up.

925
00:57:37,800 --> 00:57:38,800
What?

926
00:57:38,800 --> 00:57:39,800
May I kiss the bride?

927
00:57:39,800 --> 00:57:40,800
No!

928
00:57:40,800 --> 00:57:43,400
What's the range of my shotgun?

929
00:57:43,400 --> 00:57:47,400
It's a 15 foot cone, so you have to move up a bit to do it.

930
00:57:47,400 --> 00:57:50,920
Alright, I move up halfway up the aisle.

931
00:57:50,920 --> 00:57:55,480
Or actually, I guess a little more than halfway.

932
00:57:55,480 --> 00:58:00,680
I'll move not close enough that they can get me in melee range, like up here.

933
00:58:00,680 --> 00:58:05,320
And then I shoot my shotgun at them.

934
00:58:05,320 --> 00:58:12,320
is

935
00:58:12,320 --> 00:58:15,280
kurch of kurt coban shotgun at them

936
00:58:15,280 --> 00:58:17,640
that's a seven

937
00:58:17,640 --> 00:58:21,480
that is the uh... you shoot at them and somehow all the the spread just goes

938
00:58:21,480 --> 00:58:23,680
around that place it's just like

939
00:58:23,680 --> 00:58:26,240
goes right around them you see the terrorist like

940
00:58:26,240 --> 00:58:30,120
puppets like kind of haphazardly dodging

941
00:58:30,120 --> 00:58:33,080
uh... they all look like a committed that terrorists of course

942
00:58:33,080 --> 00:58:35,480
uh... and uh...

943
00:58:35,480 --> 00:58:41,560
it is now your turn

944
00:58:41,560 --> 00:58:46,560
Okay, uh, I take Jedediah's hand and lead him into the lavatory.

945
00:58:46,560 --> 00:58:50,560
Oh no, we're all gonna die!

946
00:58:50,560 --> 00:58:53,560
Finally, joining the mile-high club!

947
00:58:53,560 --> 00:58:58,560
Can it be that during our lovemaking we, uh, we tamper with the smoke detector?

948
00:58:58,560 --> 00:59:04,560
Uh, yeah, I'll have you roll... to wait, to what end?

949
00:59:04,560 --> 00:59:06,560
Uh, you're not supposed to do it!

950
00:59:06,560 --> 00:59:13,560
it's

951
00:59:13,560 --> 00:59:17,560
uh...

952
00:59:17,560 --> 00:59:19,120
the

953
00:59:19,120 --> 00:59:20,640
which should that be

954
00:59:20,640 --> 00:59:24,160
i guess role in our contract is it's got a magical

955
00:59:24,160 --> 00:59:25,200
uh...

956
00:59:25,200 --> 00:59:27,440

958
00:59:30,080 --> 00:59:31,000
yet again

959
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:34,240
yet you're able to successfully tamper with that i mean that's not hard to

960
00:59:34,240 --> 00:59:48,640
to

961
00:59:48,640 --> 00:59:55,640
the

962
00:59:55,640 --> 01:00:02,640

01:10:35,680 --> 01:10:42,880
a little bit more to if you want to but that's uh yeah all right I sort of tip

1177
01:10:42,880 --> 01:10:47,040
my hat over my eyes and take a little nap

1178
01:10:47,040 --> 01:11:04,960
it is now it is now Wahlberg's turn all right so I'm at 6% health so I move a

1179
01:11:04,960 --> 01:11:12,080
little bit over. Okay. But I immediately hit him with the go. I'm close enough to

1180
01:11:12,080 --> 01:11:18,200
hit him with the go patch lately right? Yes you are. So I just fucking whip it at

1181
01:11:18,200 --> 01:11:21,960
his head. Nice do it. Roll for that. How much time do we have left by the way?

1182
01:11:21,960 --> 01:11:29,800
Seven. Oh time in terms of oh yeah. In terms of the the catch. Yeah I just realized. Gas. Yeah so

1183
01:11:29,800 --> 01:11:37,000
So after this you'll have, you'll have I guess 1, 2, 3, 4, you have a lot of rounds.

1184
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:39,000
You have like 10 more, you'll have like 8 more rounds.

1185
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:40,000
Oh, that's easy.

1186
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:41,000
Come on.

1187
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:42,000
You have 6 seconds to round it.

1188
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:43,000
Get back in the bathroom.

1189
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:44,000
Oh shit, sorry.

1190
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:45,000
What just happened?

1191
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:48,800
I'm sorry, I moved my desk weird.

1192
01:11:48,800 --> 01:11:53,320
I whipped the shillelagh at his head, I got 7 damage with 12 bludgeoning.

1193
01:11:53,320 --> 01:11:55,680
No, so that's a 7.

1194
01:11:55,680 --> 01:11:56,680
That's what it says.

1195
01:11:56,680 --> 01:11:58,940
(laughing)

1196
01:11:58,940 --> 01:12:01,480
- I've just done this so many times.

1197
01:12:01,480 --> 01:12:02,320
- I know.

1198
01:12:02,320 --> 01:12:03,640
(laughing)

1199
01:12:03,640 --> 01:12:04,880
- But you still have not,

1200
01:12:04,880 --> 01:12:07,000
you gotta hang what it says. - It's an attack to a seven.

1201
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:08,560
So attack roll seven means it doesn't,

1202
01:12:08,560 --> 01:12:09,400
it's not gonna hit him.

1203
01:12:09,400 --> 01:12:11,800
So you swing the shillelagh

1204
01:12:11,800 --> 01:12:14,120
and you just like whiff,

1205
01:12:14,120 --> 01:12:15,500
you just get too into it.

1206
01:12:15,500 --> 01:12:19,040
And you whiff this puppet.

1207
01:12:19,040 --> 01:12:21,320
But it's a hardy whiff.

1208
01:12:21,320 --> 01:12:23,360
You knock it to the seat next to it

1209
01:12:23,360 --> 01:12:25,820
and you just like take a chunk off of the seat

1210
01:12:25,820 --> 01:12:28,900
with usually

1211
01:12:28,900 --> 01:12:31,220
and now it is their turn now

1212
01:12:31,220 --> 01:12:35,840
and they are this this this terrorist the terrorist in the back is now they come

1213
01:12:35,840 --> 01:12:37,100

1214
01:12:37,100 --> 01:12:40,620
uh... because he has a hand with a fork it in his face

1215
01:12:40,620 --> 01:12:43,020

1216
01:12:43,020 --> 01:12:44,220
uh...

1217
01:12:44,220 --> 01:12:46,500

01:12:46,500 --> 01:12:48,380
in no

1219
01:12:48,380 --> 01:12:51,500
the attack reflects off of his stomach corn

1220
01:12:51,500 --> 01:12:52,260
that's right

1221
01:12:52,260 --> 01:12:53,660
so in the senate

1222
01:12:53,660 --> 01:12:57,320

1228
01:13:11,140 --> 01:13:12,300
uh...

1229
01:13:12,300 --> 01:13:13,980

You're very lucky. It did five. It did five damage.

1243
01:13:50,460 --> 01:13:54,420
Is there, can I, can I jump in front of the bullet? No,

1244
01:13:54,420 --> 01:13:59,220

1245
01:13:59,220 --> 01:14:02,100
we could change it though. Later. I'll change it later.

1246
01:14:02,100 --> 01:14:05,740
Can I do that later? Can you promise me I'll do it once? Okay, cool.

1247
01:14:05,740 --> 01:14:09,820
I could promise you you could do it once. Okay, cool. I love my friends.

1248
01:14:09,820 --> 01:14:13,980
You take five damage. You're so far away too. It's like,

1260
01:14:41,220 --> 01:14:43,860
I don't really know how to talk like Amish.

1261
01:14:43,860 --> 01:14:45,780
Is that like a weird robot?

1262
01:14:45,780 --> 01:14:46,780
Like how are you doing?

1263
01:14:46,780 --> 01:14:47,780
Can you show me?

1264
01:14:47,780 --> 01:14:48,780
Nope.

1265
01:14:48,780 --> 01:14:49,780
That's Amish.

1266
01:14:49,780 --> 01:14:52,780
That guy knows what a robot is.

1267
01:14:52,780 --> 01:14:54,780
All robots are weird.

1268
01:14:54,780 --> 01:14:59,420
Dad, I know you love robots, but please stop talking about them.

1269
01:14:59,420 --> 01:15:01,660
I'm trying to get the dishes done.

1270
01:15:01,660 --> 01:15:04,180
Okay, son.

1271
01:15:04,180 --> 01:15:05,900
I'm at a loss now.

1272
01:15:05,900 --> 01:15:07,180
Okay, son.

1273
01:15:07,180 --> 01:15:08,180
That sounds good to me.

1274
01:15:08,180 --> 01:15:09,180
In the flashback.

1275
01:15:09,180 --> 01:15:10,180
In the flashback.

1276
01:15:10,180 --> 01:15:11,720
in the flashback.

1277
01:15:11,720 --> 01:15:14,340
My life is flashing before my eyes right now.

1278
01:15:14,340 --> 01:15:19,300
I flash back to the first room where we had the things on our penis and I go, "Wow, that

1279
01:15:19,300 --> 01:15:23,100
was crazy!"

1280
01:15:23,100 --> 01:15:24,100
What happens, Patrick?

1281
01:15:24,100 --> 01:15:25,580
Your life flashes before your eyes?

1282
01:15:25,580 --> 01:15:27,620
My life is flashing before my eyes.

1283
01:15:27,620 --> 01:15:29,900
I'm sitting here, I'm at one health.

1284
01:15:29,900 --> 01:15:36,260
I'm remembering being in the background of the Good Vibrations video.

1285
01:15:36,260 --> 01:15:42,600
I'm thinking I'm just I'm just thinking about that video. That's the only good memory. I have in my life

1286
01:15:42,600 --> 01:15:44,760
Yeah, you see you see

1287
01:15:44,760 --> 01:15:49,740
Mark turn to you and he goes like one two step get the steps right okay, Alec. Are you not gonna be in the video?

1288
01:15:49,740 --> 01:15:52,260

1289
01:15:52,260 --> 01:15:55,060
No you fuck off

1290
01:15:55,060 --> 01:16:01,620
We're going to digitally edit you out of this video frame by frame we're shooting on film dumbass

1291
01:16:01,620 --> 01:16:07,660
How you gonna fucking digitally edit it? I'm gonna digitally edit your dick out of your mouth. I would hold on I'm figuring out

1292
01:16:07,660 --> 01:16:11,580
How do you like that I

1293
01:16:11,580 --> 01:16:15,080
Don't like Donnie better than you fucking let me be in all the new kids videos

1294
01:16:15,080 --> 01:16:21,680
Yeah, well Donnie Donnie's not gonna be ever be as successful as me because we're about oh, oh, we're already kind of big

1295
01:16:21,680 --> 01:16:26,720
We're already kind of big but you know this is really gonna put us on the map. No, it's not

1296
01:16:28,900 --> 01:16:32,920
It's just all a pipe dream mock it really is nothing ever

1297
01:16:32,920 --> 01:16:37,920
You know a craving for Boston Boston action stars for some reason people love it. Nah

1298
01:16:37,920 --> 01:16:40,620
They have it of not another be an underweight model

1299
01:16:40,620 --> 01:16:45,200
They could never have a underwear model from Boston that would never fucking happen. I know

1300
01:16:45,200 --> 01:16:50,800
I know that's what dad said, but I can prove him wrong. Okay, you're not gonna prove shit

1301
01:16:50,800 --> 01:16:53,540
And what's going on Peter?

1302
01:16:53,540 --> 01:16:56,580
And that's the best memory of my life. I

1303
01:16:57,900 --> 01:17:03,120
I also have a flashback to my good vibrations, which is when I put a cicada in my asshole. I

1304
01:17:03,120 --> 01:17:10,520
Like that whenever one of us has a flashback we all just have a flashback at the same time

1305
01:17:10,520 --> 01:17:17,220
Yeah, it's like imagining the Saw movies and it's like just the plot is the the pacing is so insane

1306
01:17:17,220 --> 01:17:24,140
Cool yeah, so you're just screaming in pain by the way, you're down to one HP

1307
01:17:26,200 --> 01:17:31,200
It is now your turn, Jedidiah.

1308
01:17:31,200 --> 01:17:34,200
Can I heal Alec?

1309
01:17:34,200 --> 01:17:39,200
Uh, you could try with Amish magics.

1310
01:17:39,200 --> 01:17:43,200
Okay, I'm gonna try and heal him with Amish magics.

1311
01:17:43,200 --> 01:17:45,200
This is not gonna go well.

1312
01:17:45,200 --> 01:17:47,200
It's gone well every single time.

1313
01:17:47,200 --> 01:17:48,200
Oh!

1314
01:17:48,200 --> 01:17:49,200
Twenty.

1315
01:17:49,200 --> 01:17:52,200
So do you count my religion bonus on top of it?

1316
01:17:52,200 --> 01:17:53,200
Yeah, I do.

1317
01:17:53,200 --> 01:17:55,200
Okay, so it's a twenty again.

1318
01:17:55,200 --> 01:17:58,200

Both of those spells actually don't...

1324
01:18:09,200 --> 01:18:12,200
Wow, hmm. That's pretty funny of me.

1325
01:18:12,200 --> 01:18:14,200

And yeah, then now his other leg is asleep.

1451

And after the brain turns to jelly.

1452
01:25:35,020 --> 01:25:43,180
And then his fingernails fall off and he sees the face of the one that got away.

1453
01:25:43,220 --> 01:25:45,860

01:29:02,780 --> 01:29:05,780
Okay, well you miss with that.

1519
01:29:05,780 --> 01:29:07,780
But it's a lot cooler.

1520
01:29:07,780 --> 01:29:10,780
Everybody's like, "Damn, that's so cool!"

1521
01:29:10,780 --> 01:29:15,780
Yeah, you turn into a dance move when you miss.

1522
01:29:15,780 --> 01:29:17,780
That's what I meant to do.

1523
01:29:17,780 --> 01:29:22,780
It is now your turn, Michael Dangerous.

1524
01:29:22,780 --> 01:29:24,780
Again?

1525
01:29:24,780 --> 01:29:31,780
right

1526
01:29:31,780 --> 01:29:46,780
the

1527
01:29:46,780 --> 01:29:53,780
the

1528
01:29:53,780 --> 01:30:01,260
the

1529
01:30:01,260 --> 01:30:10,460
the

1530
01:30:10,660 --> 01:30:14,160
i issued him and uh... he flies

1531
01:30:14,160 --> 01:30:16,720
back in the one that i realized

1532
01:30:16,720 --> 01:30:18,240
he uh...

1533
01:30:18,240 --> 01:30:22,520
he hits one of the windows on the side of the cabin and he gets he gets sucked out

1534
01:30:22,520 --> 01:30:24,080
like it's a spaceship

1535
01:30:24,080 --> 01:30:25,240
you can't

1536
01:30:25,240 --> 01:30:27,120
any flies into the world trade center

1537
01:30:27,120 --> 01:30:32,800
and the world trade that was up

1538
01:30:32,800 --> 01:30:33,640
uh...

1539
01:30:33,640 --> 01:30:35,080
yet and with that

1540
01:30:35,080 --> 01:30:37,600
with with time to spare

1541
01:30:37,600 --> 01:30:40,600
the uh... cause we successfully cause not a lot of

1542
01:30:40,600 --> 01:30:41,800
yeah

1543
01:30:41,800 --> 01:30:45,000
that he's successfully cause i can never fucking do that

1544
01:30:45,000 --> 01:30:47,080
and i don't want to do that

1545
01:30:47,080 --> 01:30:50,880
in the able to stop it but you could have never got a stick with it

1546
01:30:50,880 --> 01:30:53,280
started

1547
01:30:53,280 --> 01:30:54,800
you've sought you've

1548
01:30:54,800 --> 01:30:58,120
you've done it all of us and you saw a flight nine eleven puzzle

1549
01:30:58,120 --> 01:31:02,800
uh... and uh... the plane begins to fall away

1550
01:31:02,800 --> 01:31:05,640
uh... it sort of like sir select because it

1551
01:31:05,640 --> 01:31:10,440
like opens up and you all drop like 10 feet to the ground.

1552
01:31:10,440 --> 01:31:13,540
And in this chamber,

1553
01:31:13,540 --> 01:31:16,940
I like this.

1554
01:31:16,940 --> 01:31:20,140
This is a red room with a giant pig for everyone who's

1555
01:31:20,140 --> 01:31:25,540
as a giant pig spinning on a rotisserie

1556
01:31:25,540 --> 01:31:33,040
is a big blue ribbon on it.

1557
01:31:33,040 --> 01:31:35,760
that says, "World's Pig."

1558
01:31:35,760 --> 01:31:38,000
(laughing)

1559
01:31:38,000 --> 01:31:44,480
And a note that says,

1560
01:31:44,480 --> 01:31:50,380
"Climb into the pig to find the key, Dieter."

1561
01:31:50,380 --> 01:31:56,360
- That's all we get from the Jigsaw Man?

1562
01:31:56,360 --> 01:31:57,360
- That's all you get this time.

1563
01:31:57,360 --> 01:31:58,200
- A note?

1564
01:31:59,720 --> 01:32:03,760

1575
01:32:27,080 --> 01:32:29,840

uh... well i i i sex the pig

1577

01:32:41,720 --> 01:32:43,440
he's okay

1582
01:32:43,440 --> 01:32:47,920
seeing that seeing these guys crawl into the pig i have a flashback of my son's

1583
01:32:47,920 --> 01:32:50,760
birth

1584
01:32:50,760 --> 01:32:55,840
and i'm not going to go into any more detail on what that means

1585
01:32:55,840 --> 01:32:56,820
and uh...

1586
01:32:56,820 --> 01:33:00,980
do you call to the piggy crawl through its it's it's all it's like holding on on

1587
01:33:00,980 --> 01:33:03,220
his pierce's defeat

1588
01:33:03,220 --> 01:33:06,060
this as he as he crawls with his arms

1589
01:33:06,060 --> 01:33:09,140
yeah you're digging through the pig commando style you two are just sort of

1590
01:33:09,140 --> 01:33:11,640
outside while this is happening

1591
01:33:11,640 --> 01:33:15,960
and uh... eventually you reach a part of a pig in you know anatomy of pigs pretty

1592
01:33:15,960 --> 01:33:19,860
well pierce that's right just i feel like a close my eyes

1593
01:33:19,860 --> 01:33:23,900
and you start to realize your your you are closing your eyes summary and you

1594
01:33:23,900 --> 01:33:26,180
should realize that's true is

1595
01:33:26,180 --> 01:33:27,420
a

1596
01:33:27,420 --> 01:33:31,380
divot in front of you that you don't recognize and uh...

1597
01:33:31,380 --> 01:33:32,940
uh... you

1598
01:33:32,940 --> 01:33:35,360
sort of like your arms are to go through it

1599
01:33:35,360 --> 01:33:36,460
and then you start to

1600
01:33:36,460 --> 01:33:40,900
slide down through it slide down to this viscera of the inside this pig

1601
01:33:40,900 --> 01:33:45,180
it's on an estin of any kind you can tell so i almost like it was carved

1602
01:33:45,180 --> 01:33:47,300
out to the

1603
01:33:47,300 --> 01:33:48,140
uh...

1604
01:33:48,140 --> 01:33:50,040
and as this is happening

1605
01:33:50,040 --> 01:33:53,340
uh... you start to hear a voice now booming over the loudspeakers in this

1606
01:33:53,340 --> 01:33:54,100
room

1607
01:33:54,100 --> 01:33:58,100
uh... and uh... at least from what you can tell you here it didn't and from

1608
01:33:58,100 --> 01:34:01,820
you guys on the outside you see the pig's mouth moving as it's spinning

1609
01:34:01,820 --> 01:34:04,320
probable product

1610
01:34:04,320 --> 01:34:05,920
peter temporary

1611
01:34:05,920 --> 01:34:09,040
you've always been a curious young man have achieved by a slightly through the

1612
01:34:09,040 --> 01:34:11,420
test and switch it and i a m

1613
01:34:11,420 --> 01:34:12,940
ever since you were a boy

1614
01:34:12,940 --> 01:34:14,280
you can try to do that

1615
01:34:14,280 --> 01:34:18,380
things sit in toy story did except with a real baby in a real spider

1616
01:34:18,380 --> 01:34:21,700
you've always been interested in the experimental world of animal silent

1617
01:34:21,700 --> 01:34:24,500
science and hybrid creatures in your own perverse way.

1618
01:34:24,500 --> 01:34:27,400
As you grew you found there was more freedom in running your

1619
01:34:27,400 --> 01:34:29,900
own ranch experimenting on animals there.

1620
01:34:29,900 --> 01:34:33,800
Rather than going to some school where there's rules and

1621
01:34:33,800 --> 01:34:37,200
ethics you experimented wantonly fucking any creature that

1622
01:34:37,200 --> 01:34:39,000
came your way don't matter to the species.

1623
01:34:39,000 --> 01:34:42,700
But finally that came up to you caught caught up to you.

1624
01:34:42,700 --> 01:34:43,400
I'm sorry.

1625
01:34:43,400 --> 01:34:46,400
I'm reading from a it's a very not a lot of light here.

1626
01:34:49,200 --> 01:34:55,600
You did something so wrong, so crazy, that even you knew the second you did it, that there was no going back.

1627
01:34:55,600 --> 01:34:57,600
Say it.

1628
01:34:57,600 --> 01:35:04,000
Uh, what do you want me to say, man? I was young, I was hungry.

1629
01:35:04,000 --> 01:35:08,000
I was dumb and full of cum.

1630
01:35:08,000 --> 01:35:09,600
Say what you did.

1631
01:35:15,600 --> 01:35:21,000
I jerked off a bull and had a cum into my hands.

1632
01:35:21,000 --> 01:35:25,320
You filled a chicken egg with pig cum and shot it into a cow's pussy with a bumper

1633
01:35:25,320 --> 01:35:26,320
bus.

1634
01:35:26,320 --> 01:35:31,440
Oh right, I was young, dumb, and had a bull cum from a cow's ass.

1635
01:35:31,440 --> 01:35:34,920
So many animal sins that you don't even know.

1636
01:35:34,920 --> 01:35:37,200
I was trying to help it get out.

1637
01:35:37,200 --> 01:35:38,200
You can't even narrow it down.

1638
01:35:38,200 --> 01:35:39,200
Was it bull cum from a cow's ass?

1639
01:35:39,200 --> 01:35:42,840
There's a lot of reasons you could be here right now.

1640
01:35:42,840 --> 01:35:44,720
It was pig jizz and a cow's cunt?

1641
01:35:44,720 --> 01:35:47,800
it was that one where i...

1642
01:35:47,800 --> 01:35:49,280
uh... put yeah...

1643
01:35:49,280 --> 01:35:53,440
you had a flashback where you put a cicada in your ass

1644
01:35:53,440 --> 01:35:57,200
and that was the first thing i was thinking maybe this will be it

1645
01:35:57,200 --> 01:36:02,600
but then you did this... no i remember i filled a chicken egg with pig jizz and shot it into a cow's cunt

1646
01:36:02,600 --> 01:36:02,960
or

1647
01:36:02,960 --> 01:36:07,920
what was it the other way i don't even fucking remember i was... i can't believe you don't

1648
01:36:07,920 --> 01:36:13,680
remember this... i was stupid back then i was so hungry i didn't know how shit like that worked

1649
01:36:13,680 --> 01:36:15,680
you just slide it

1650
01:36:15,680 --> 01:36:17,680
test it

1651
01:36:17,680 --> 01:36:19,680
you have a

1652
01:36:19,680 --> 01:36:21,680
you try to have a flashback but it's just like

1653
01:36:21,680 --> 01:36:23,680
i was too hungry

1654
01:36:23,680 --> 01:36:25,680
i've been married

1655
01:36:25,680 --> 01:36:27,680
to all sorts of f*cking critters

1656
01:36:27,680 --> 01:36:29,680
i didn't know that a critter had to be married

1657
01:36:29,680 --> 01:36:31,680
to a critter that just looked like it

1658
01:36:31,680 --> 01:36:33,680
i didn't know that a pig had

1659
01:36:33,680 --> 01:36:35,680
to be with a pig i don't wanna live in a

1660
01:36:35,680 --> 01:36:37,680
world like that so sue me

1661
01:36:37,680 --> 01:36:39,680
anchor plunk

1662
01:36:39,680 --> 01:36:41,680
you land in this lab mid

1663
01:36:41,680 --> 01:36:48,000
rant and you're suddenly strapped to this table and sitting and before you I'm

1664
01:36:48,000 --> 01:36:55,480
still like hanging off the table holding before you is one of your experiments

1665
01:36:55,480 --> 01:37:00,480
long-forgotten back when you were a little bit more academic in some of my

1666
01:37:00,480 --> 01:37:09,200
pursuits okay you thought you're Dieter Dimbre you thought you could experiment

1667
01:37:09,200 --> 01:37:12,760
with the lives of others, but now you will be the experiment.

1668
01:37:12,760 --> 01:37:17,760
Meet my assistant, experiment 1175936, as you called him.

1669
01:37:17,760 --> 01:37:20,720
Do you remember him?

1670
01:37:20,720 --> 01:37:25,140
He remembers you, and you see before you a dog head

1671
01:37:25,140 --> 01:37:28,600
on top of a frog's body with Doug Benson's legs.

1672
01:37:28,600 --> 01:37:30,840
(laughing)

1673
01:37:30,840 --> 01:37:35,880
- All right, I flashback to getting Doug with I.

1674
01:37:37,840 --> 01:37:40,480
- Right, caught a contact high being on set

1675
01:37:40,480 --> 01:37:42,680
from getting Doug with high.

1676
01:37:42,680 --> 01:37:47,680
Was going through Doug Benson's trash.

1677
01:37:47,680 --> 01:37:49,720
- Yeah, more trash.

1678
01:37:49,720 --> 01:37:50,560
- Yeah.

1679
01:37:50,560 --> 01:37:53,120
- And then Doug Benson comes out and says,

1680
01:37:53,120 --> 01:37:54,360
"What are you doing, man?

1681
01:37:54,360 --> 01:37:56,100
I'm stoned."

1682
01:37:56,100 --> 01:37:59,280
- Is that what he sounds like?

1683
01:37:59,280 --> 01:38:00,120
- Yeah, that's it.

1684
01:38:00,120 --> 01:38:01,720
(laughing)

1685
01:38:01,720 --> 01:38:04,680
- I walk out of this flashback,

1686
01:38:04,680 --> 01:38:06,880
I'm also in the green room with Doug.

1687
01:38:06,880 --> 01:38:13,040

i don't even smoke i just love the way it smells

1691
01:38:23,040 --> 01:38:26,720
and

1692
01:38:26,720 --> 01:38:30,300
uh... and uh... yet the uh...

1693
01:38:30,300 --> 01:38:32,160
the the experiment

1694
01:38:32,160 --> 01:38:36,240
with the dog had the frog body and doug benson's legs comes up to you

1695
01:38:36,240 --> 01:38:41,240
And he says, "Do you remember me, dear?"

1696
01:38:41,240 --> 01:38:47,740
"You must be one of my one, two, three, fuck, I'm getting busy, one of my hundred kids."

1697
01:38:47,740 --> 01:38:57,240
"You brought me into this terrible world. You gave me a name. It was just a number. I gave myself a name. It's Davinder."

1698
01:38:57,240 --> 01:39:05,240
"Hmm... What was your fuckin'... What are you, four, five, six, seven? Shit, I'm getting

1699
01:39:05,240 --> 01:39:17,640
busy. Eight, nine, what was the number?" "Now I'm going to attach bugles to your fingertips

1700
01:39:17,640 --> 01:39:26,400
and then kill you!" And on the outside, meanwhile, this pig is spinning and was talking. You

1701
01:39:26,400 --> 01:39:30,040
start to see the fire underneath the pig you too

1702
01:39:30,040 --> 01:39:31,520
uh...

1703
01:39:31,520 --> 01:39:33,320
uh... alec

1704
01:39:33,320 --> 01:39:36,000
wallberg and michael dangerous

1705
01:39:36,000 --> 01:39:40,180
the fire keeps getting bigger

1706
01:39:40,180 --> 01:39:44,980
the only way out of this room alive will be to get the key

1707
01:39:44,980 --> 01:39:46,400
i said the information

1708
01:39:46,400 --> 01:39:50,680
no that's not

1709
01:39:50,680 --> 01:39:52,800
that will not work this time

1710
01:39:52,800 --> 01:39:53,760
say it again

1711
01:39:53,760 --> 01:39:58,280
Please I mean it's just bad. It's bad. I

1712
01:39:58,280 --> 01:40:02,860
Shouldn't choose these ones. Why can't I fucking say it? I was saying it in a song

1713
01:40:02,860 --> 01:40:08,400
No, that's not you couldn't know. I don't want to live. I'm not here to do this

1714
01:40:08,400 --> 01:40:12,800
I was just saying it a fucking song you're singing along to a Marky Mark song. I

1715
01:40:12,800 --> 01:40:16,040
Was singing along to what a marks fucking demos

1716
01:40:16,040 --> 01:40:18,200
Okay

1717
01:40:18,200 --> 01:40:20,320
That's fine. I mean like whatever you do

1718
01:40:20,320 --> 01:40:22,920
- Look, there were a lot more in the fucking,

1719
01:40:22,920 --> 01:40:23,760
there were a lot more of those in the--

1720
01:40:23,760 --> 01:40:25,080
- I'm losing a jigsaw voice.

1721
01:40:25,080 --> 01:40:28,360
The more I talk to you about this N-word thing.

1722
01:40:28,360 --> 01:40:29,640
- There were a lot more N-words

1723
01:40:29,640 --> 01:40:31,480
in the Good Vibrations demo, I'll tell you that.

1724
01:40:31,480 --> 01:40:32,520
- Really?

1725
01:40:32,520 --> 01:40:34,280
Sorry, that was an accident.

1726
01:40:34,280 --> 01:40:35,680
- You're fucking weird.

1727
01:40:35,680 --> 01:40:36,640
You're weird as shit.

1728
01:40:36,640 --> 01:40:38,740
- The laugh just gets triggered sometimes.

1729
01:40:38,740 --> 01:40:44,600
- So yeah, both of you roll initiative.

1730
01:40:44,600 --> 01:40:46,160
All four of you really roll initiative

1731
01:40:46,160 --> 01:40:48,500
because you'll all be acting within order.

1732
01:40:48,500 --> 01:40:55,000
Um, and, okay, cool, let me add this.

1733
01:40:55,000 --> 01:41:03,500
So the idea here is that you're going to have probably only, let me think,

1734
01:41:03,500 --> 01:41:07,500
yeah, you're going to have like three rounds before the fire consumes the room.

1735
01:41:07,500 --> 01:41:10,500
You need to get to kill him and get the key before that.

1736
01:41:10,500 --> 01:41:14,500
Or you need to get the key and burrow out of the pig.

1737
01:41:15,000 --> 01:41:17,560
the key you will notice is on

1738
01:41:17,560 --> 01:41:22,220
uh... a belt loop of uh... the of uh... davender

1739
01:41:22,220 --> 01:41:26,020
so you can try to snatch it from him

1740
01:41:26,020 --> 01:41:27,300
and is that is that

1741
01:41:27,300 --> 01:41:29,800
did i in the room with me yes i'm with you

1742
01:41:29,800 --> 01:41:31,360
yeah that was a good move

1743
01:41:31,360 --> 01:41:34,900
you know you're gonna be a smart easy yeah hitching myself

1744
01:41:34,900 --> 01:41:35,980
yeah

1745
01:41:35,980 --> 01:41:38,080
getting hitched alright

1746
01:41:38,080 --> 01:41:40,760
we did get hitched so wait who goes first

1747
01:41:40,760 --> 01:41:42,400
uh... about to find out

1748
01:41:42,400 --> 01:41:44,160
looks like it's gonna be

1749
01:41:44,160 --> 01:41:50,040
allocates your you go first alec walberg

1750
01:41:50,040 --> 01:41:52,160
what can i do here

1751
01:41:52,160 --> 01:41:57,160
chemistry smarts

1752
01:41:57,160 --> 01:42:00,120
right on the is my street smarts i'm gonna assess whether or not this is

1753
01:42:00,120 --> 01:42:01,280
bullshit

1754
01:42:01,280 --> 01:42:04,080
uh...

1755
01:42:04,080 --> 01:42:05,280
okay

1756
01:42:05,280 --> 01:42:07,280
that's so the way that

1757
01:42:07,280 --> 01:42:12,520
uh... that ability works is on any check

1758
01:42:12,520 --> 01:42:13,680
uh...

1759
01:42:13,680 --> 01:42:20,940
that you're suspect of, whether it's an investigation check or whatever, that you've seen made or

1760
01:42:20,940 --> 01:42:27,600
that you have, you can just change it to a 15.

1761
01:42:27,600 --> 01:42:29,360
That's not really happening right now.

1762
01:42:29,360 --> 01:42:33,440
Okay, so I can't use that right now.

1763
01:42:33,440 --> 01:42:37,480
You could, if you want to find another way out of the room or you want to find a way

1764
01:42:37,480 --> 01:42:41,880
to stop the fire, you use one of those checks and then you can use your street smarts if

1765
01:42:41,880 --> 01:42:42,880
it's lower than a 15.

1766
01:42:42,880 --> 01:42:44,880
Okay, all right

1767
01:42:44,880 --> 01:42:49,400
All right, I'm gonna use an investigation check and I'm gonna try see

1768
01:42:49,400 --> 01:42:55,600
I'm gonna see if I can shut off the fire because there's definitely I've worked in kitchens before yeah, I like I know

1769
01:42:55,600 --> 01:43:02,120
I know that the fire has to come from some propane source. Yes. Okay. Yeah do an investigation check on that

1770
01:43:02,120 --> 01:43:11,220
Okay, you can swap that out using your street smarts, all right, I'm using that okay, so yeah, you got a 12 but your street smarts

1771
01:43:12,240 --> 01:43:16,680
What do you remember? What helps you? What's what kind of you know genius you got going on here?

1772
01:43:16,680 --> 01:43:20,000
That's helping you wanna fucking we had a luau at Wahlburgers before

1773
01:43:20,000 --> 01:43:27,760
Fire doesn't go on the side of the fucking pig it goes under so obviously this guy's never been to a fucking luau I

1774
01:43:27,760 --> 01:43:30,400
Never got invited

1775
01:43:30,400 --> 01:43:36,400
Yeah, that's right bitch look at you. You fucking look weird. You look weird. You can't see me right now. I can't

1776
01:43:36,400 --> 01:43:40,240
Earlier, and you look like I did look weird

1777
01:43:40,880 --> 01:43:46,680
Out of your pants. I'm not no it's not you look like a fucking puppet dude. I don't look weird

1778
01:43:46,680 --> 01:43:53,560
You look weird. You're a puppet. You're a puppet. You're a second. I recognize that voice is that is that Tobin Bell?

1779
01:43:53,560 --> 01:44:08,020
So what happens when you realize so what you happens is you you remember from your luau days

1780
01:44:10,080 --> 01:44:17,080
wall burgers. Wall burgers Hawaii. Yeah, and you notice that, um, that, uh, I see two,

1781
01:44:17,080 --> 01:44:24,800
I see two little like, like little things poking out of the ground that like the propane

1782
01:44:24,800 --> 01:44:31,800
things. Yeah, and, and if you, you could potentially, what you could do next turn is go in there,

1783
01:44:31,800 --> 01:44:35,760
you can move there now, but then you'll take fire damage. So I would, I tell Cameron to

1784
01:44:35,760 --> 01:44:50,760
the

1785
01:44:50,760 --> 01:44:55,840
like undo the propane tank. Okay, it is your turn. My turn. Oh,

1786
01:44:55,840 --> 01:44:59,280
Cameron. Okay, nevermind. I dangerous. Wait, so it would be

1787
01:44:59,280 --> 01:45:02,160
better if I helped him undo the propane tank. Yeah. So here's

1788
01:45:02,160 --> 01:45:06,640
what Pat here's what Patrick would have discovered is that if

1789
01:45:06,640 --> 01:45:11,400
you smash the the propane nozzles, you can have it so that

1790
01:45:11,400 --> 01:45:13,840
the flames don't have any room to come out and it builds back

1791
01:45:13,840 --> 01:45:18,320
up underneath the ground and can make it malfunction. Okay, I

1792
01:45:18,320 --> 01:45:33,320
that

1793
01:45:33,320 --> 01:45:40,320
else

1794
01:45:40,320 --> 01:45:57,320
my

1795
01:45:57,320 --> 01:46:00,360
dot com towards the propane tank that's the

1796
01:46:00,360 --> 01:46:00,960
here

1797
01:46:00,960 --> 01:46:04,840

1798
01:46:04,840 --> 01:46:06,720
fight i shoot the nozzle

1799
01:46:06,720 --> 01:46:10,760
yet what we get in a prone position will you shut up

1800
01:46:10,760 --> 01:46:11,520
uh... home

1801
01:46:11,520 --> 01:46:14,160

I eat the newborn. The newborn slides out of the pussy and right into my open mouth.

1856
01:49:55,000 --> 01:50:02,000
And then I pat my belly three times before even getting to know the hybrid in question.

1857
01:50:02,000 --> 01:50:07,600
And Davinder is cowering in the corner for the past two weeks watching this happen.

1858
01:50:07,600 --> 01:50:09,600
Yeah, my first time in a place like this.

1859
01:50:09,600 --> 01:50:12,600
And he's remembering, and he runs away from you.

1860
01:50:12,600 --> 01:50:14,600
Ah, now I remember that little critter.

1861
01:50:14,600 --> 01:50:16,600
[laughter]

1862
01:50:16,600 --> 01:50:20,600
You scat me! You ate my brothers!

1863
01:50:20,600 --> 01:50:22,600
This is giving me an ad beer.

1864
01:50:22,600 --> 01:50:24,600
No.

1865
01:50:24,600 --> 01:50:32,600
I give the blunderbuss and the egg that I made with my wife or husband to Jedidiah.

1866
01:50:32,600 --> 01:50:38,600
I say, "Try to get this out of here and put pig kame and shoot it into the pig's pussy."

1867
01:50:38,600 --> 01:50:42,600
"I have to go jack off a pig?"

1868
01:50:42,600 --> 01:50:45,600
And then I pat his head twice and blink.

1869
01:50:45,600 --> 01:50:47,600
Yeah, that's a yes.

1870
01:50:47,600 --> 01:50:52,600
Okay, so I start crawling back through the intestinal tract to get to his...

1871
01:50:52,600 --> 01:50:59,840
Now get back here is Bruce Tate. Yeah. Yeah, so roll a heavy roll and

1872
01:50:59,840 --> 01:51:05,000
Athletics check. Okay, it's very athletic to do a move

1873
01:51:05,000 --> 01:51:12,640
Nice yeah, you get you get a little bit of way in there. I mean both you can do that

1874
01:51:12,640 --> 01:51:15,480
If you're the one doing it, you're just doing that in your turn. Yeah

1875
01:51:15,480 --> 01:51:19,280
No, I'm not doing your turn and we'll play that rest of that out in a second

1876
01:51:19,280 --> 01:51:23,280
But Dieter, so what else do you want to do in your turn? You can still attack or move.

1877
01:51:23,280 --> 01:51:32,280
Alright, uh, I sniff the room looking for animals. Other animals that are not, uh, Davinder.

1878
01:51:32,280 --> 01:51:37,280
Yeah, roll Perception. Or Nature, or whatever the fuck. Whatever you want.

1879
01:51:37,280 --> 01:51:41,280
What the fuck I want? I think I have a Nature bonus or something.

1880
01:51:41,280 --> 01:51:45,280
Yeah, I want you to like, take, yeah, it's your ability, so, yeah. Nice, yeah, okay.

1881
01:51:45,280 --> 01:51:51,900
So you see that in the back in the behind Avender there is a

1882
01:51:51,900 --> 01:51:58,320
There's an ocelot just licking its paws in a cage

1883
01:51:58,320 --> 01:52:02,280
And it says Davinder sister on

1884
01:52:02,280 --> 01:52:07,400
Yeah

1885
01:52:07,400 --> 01:52:13,560
All right, is that my move or do I still get to do something you can do something that's just you noticing shit

1886
01:52:13,760 --> 01:52:20,800
All right, so now I do insight to see if the animals giving me bedroom eyes yeah do it try to see okay

- I'm just hanging out here.

1898
01:53:17,760 --> 01:53:19,400
I'm just a pretty little ocelot.

1899
01:53:19,400 --> 01:53:22,780
- All right, I don't know what to say to her.

1901
01:53:23,620 --> 01:53:25,860
(laughing)

1902
01:53:25,860 --> 01:53:28,480
- Jedediah, hype her up.

1903
01:53:28,480 --> 01:53:30,500
- Boy, I sure wish my brother wouldn't keep me

1904
01:53:30,500 --> 01:53:31,620
in this here cage.

1905
01:53:31,620 --> 01:53:34,600
Not sure what his problem is.

1906
01:53:34,600 --> 01:53:38,960
Seems like a sins of the father situation, you know?

1907
01:53:38,960 --> 01:53:44,040
i ask ask you what is uh... what his greatest fear is a it's a

1908
01:53:44,040 --> 01:53:47,960
what you gracefully what is greatest fear and then tell me yours also if you think

1909
01:53:47,960 --> 01:53:49,960
i'm if you think i can handle it

1910
01:53:49,960 --> 01:53:51,620
the role persuasion check

1911
01:53:51,620 --> 01:53:55,140
uh... with advantage it's a because it's it's a good idea

1912
01:53:55,140 --> 01:53:57,840
so just rolling will take the bigger number

1913
01:53:57,840 --> 01:53:59,720
always show

1914
01:53:59,720 --> 01:54:02,240
will

1915
01:54:02,240 --> 01:54:04,040
net twenty

1916
01:54:04,040 --> 01:54:06,320
okay uh...

1917
01:54:06,320 --> 01:54:08,100
she says uh...

1918
01:54:08,100 --> 01:54:10,840
his greatest fear

1919
01:54:10,840 --> 01:54:15,100
is experimentation on his back

1920
01:54:15,100 --> 01:54:18,500
this is a good

1921
01:54:18,500 --> 01:54:20,260
it's a little bit

1922
01:54:20,260 --> 01:54:22,680
yeah that's a good

1923
01:54:22,680 --> 01:54:26,180
and then she also tell me her greatest though yes she does uh... she said that

1924
01:54:26,180 --> 01:54:27,900
but she says that she says that

1925
01:54:27,900 --> 01:54:31,220
if you make it look like you're doing an experiment on him he starts a freak out

1926
01:54:31,220 --> 01:54:34,100
and go pp

1927
01:54:34,100 --> 01:54:35,380
now as for me

1928
01:54:35,380 --> 01:54:36,900
my greatest fear

1929
01:54:36,900 --> 01:54:38,800
to be elected in cage forever

1930
01:54:38,800 --> 01:54:40,360
and i think that it

1931
01:54:40,360 --> 01:54:42,660
uh... i want to be free

1932
01:54:42,660 --> 01:54:45,580

and uh... it's

1937
01:54:54,740 --> 01:54:58,580

1965
01:56:04,980 --> 01:56:07,400
uh... that's too helpful then

1966
01:56:07,400 --> 01:56:09,440

reduce

1974
01:56:22,120 --> 01:56:24,640
so you cast reduce on yourself

1975
01:56:24,640 --> 01:56:28,080
which makes you a bit smaller and you're gonna have a easier time crawling

1976
01:56:28,080 --> 01:56:29,200
through

1977
01:56:29,200 --> 01:56:30,600

01:58:40,680 --> 01:58:42,740
uh...

2029
01:58:42,740 --> 01:58:45,420
I'm gonna try it can I uh...

2030
01:58:45,420 --> 01:58:48,020
my getting someone else dangerous

2031
01:58:48,020 --> 01:58:49,580
ability

2032
01:58:49,580 --> 01:58:51,900
how does that work I can add

2033
01:58:51,900 --> 01:58:56,100
add stuff to people's rolls do I have to do it when they roll or can I do it like

2034
01:58:56,100 --> 01:58:59,500
preemptively? You can give it to them and they choose when they want to use it. Okay I'm gonna use

2035
01:58:59,500 --> 01:59:01,100
I'm gonna use this

2036
01:59:01,100 --> 01:59:02,740
uh... ability

2037
01:59:02,740 --> 01:59:04,700
on uh...

2038
01:59:04,700 --> 01:59:07,020
on on Dieter Demphry

2039
01:59:07,020 --> 01:59:09,540
so that uh... so that next time

2040
01:59:09,540 --> 01:59:11,380
you next time you need it

2041
01:59:11,380 --> 01:59:13,180
You'll have a bonus on a roll.

2042
01:59:13,180 --> 01:59:13,580
Yeah.

2043
01:59:13,580 --> 01:59:16,980
So what will happen basically works like bardic inspiration except you don't

2044
01:59:16,980 --> 01:59:18,680
need a line of sight.

2045
01:59:18,680 --> 01:59:19,580
Oh, yeah, of course.

2046
01:59:19,580 --> 01:59:19,980
Oh, yeah.

2047
01:59:19,980 --> 01:59:20,280
Yeah.

2048
01:59:20,280 --> 01:59:23,980
This is for the people who you know, somebody out there is like, oh boy,

2049
01:59:23,980 --> 01:59:31,080
so, you know, all right, but for you Dieter you can add a d6 to any d20

2050
01:59:31,080 --> 01:59:31,880
roll.

2051
01:59:31,880 --> 01:59:35,380
You're going to make so like an attack role or like an ability check sort of

2052
01:59:35,380 --> 01:59:36,780
what you've been doing.

2053
01:59:36,780 --> 01:59:40,180
So, yeah, yeah, and to inspire him.

2054
01:59:40,180 --> 01:59:43,180
I'm rapping along. I'm just I'm kind of rapping to him

2055
01:59:43,180 --> 01:59:49,060
Through the pig's mouth. Yeah, and I'm guy go up to the pig's mouth and I start I start rapping into it

2056
01:59:49,060 --> 01:59:55,460
Ain't it a shame that you can't say fuck fucks just a word and it's all fucked up like a fucked up punk with the fucked

2057
01:59:55,460 --> 02:00:03,220
Up mouth a nine-inch nail gets knocked the fuck out fucked up aids from fucked up sex fake titties on a fucked up chest

2058
02:00:03,220 --> 02:00:06,940
I'm flat back to the first time I heard rap and I'm

2059
02:00:06,940 --> 02:00:08,940
I'm filling with rage.

2060
02:00:08,940 --> 02:00:10,940
*laughter*

2061
02:00:10,940 --> 02:00:14,940
Uh, yeah, and it is- it is your turn.

2062
02:00:14,940 --> 02:00:17,940
So you can- what are the results of that rage?

2063
02:00:17,940 --> 02:00:26,940
Uh, I take my pitchfork out and I try to stab, uh, Davinder, uh, in the mouth.

2064
02:00:26,940 --> 02:00:27,940
Yeah, go for it.

2065
02:00:27,940 --> 02:00:29,940
Make it look like a science experiment.

2066
02:00:29,940 --> 02:00:31,940
I don't care. I'm too angry.

2067
02:00:31,940 --> 02:00:35,940
I was never really that good of a scientist anyway, if I'm being honest.

2068
02:00:35,940 --> 02:00:42,940
this

2069
02:00:42,940 --> 02:00:47,820
Yeah, what do I do attack strength? Yeah attack. So just go to your your attack

2070
02:00:47,820 --> 02:00:52,340
Attacks and spellcasting yours pitchfork is oh, that's right. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah

2071
02:00:52,340 --> 02:00:57,580
Yeah that fucking hits and then hit pitch right inside the chat. Yeah

2072
02:00:57,580 --> 02:01:02,100
Nice. Fuck. Yeah, where do you want to stab him in his mouth?

2073
02:01:02,100 --> 02:01:07,060
Okay. Yeah, you just stab him in the mouth with a pitchfork

2074
02:01:07,060 --> 02:01:10,020
You just do a quick jab in there and jab out

2075
02:01:11,380 --> 02:01:15,960
And like blood just like squirts out of the back of his throat onto your face, okay

2076
02:01:15,960 --> 02:01:18,780
Yeah

2077
02:01:18,780 --> 02:01:22,500
You and

2078
02:01:22,500 --> 02:01:28,060
Yeah, he's not looking. Yeah, that was pretty good. He's easy. See he's not looking too hot right now. Let me tell you that

2079
02:01:28,580 --> 02:01:32,300
uh... and now it is your turn to judges is is is is it a diet

2080
02:01:32,300 --> 02:01:35,020
and i had to take falls yet

2081
02:01:35,020 --> 02:01:39,420
uh... yeah you crawled out at this point all what you call out uh...

2082
02:01:39,420 --> 02:01:43,220
but uh... uh... now you have to do used to do one actually try to get the

2083
02:01:43,220 --> 02:01:45,220
retarded jerk off this

2084
02:01:45,220 --> 02:01:47,340
spinning

2085
02:01:47,340 --> 02:01:50,860
so you need to do and and athletics check the hold on their strength check the

2086
02:01:50,860 --> 02:01:52,980
hold on to the pigs at

2087
02:01:52,980 --> 02:01:54,260
uh...

2088
02:01:54,260 --> 02:01:57,660
which can be too hard 'cause it is just a it's spinning

2089
02:01:57,660 --> 02:01:59,660
It's not like and I have done this before.

2090
02:01:59,660 --> 02:02:01,760
When I hit strength.

2091
02:02:01,760 --> 02:02:03,460
Yeah, go for it.

2092
02:02:03,460 --> 02:02:05,060
Oh, not one.

2093
02:02:05,060 --> 02:02:05,660
Nice try.

2094
02:02:05,660 --> 02:02:06,460
I'm not taking that.

2095
02:02:06,460 --> 02:02:07,160
I'm not taking that.

2096
02:02:07,160 --> 02:02:08,760
So, oh God, I actually hit it.

2097
02:02:08,760 --> 02:02:12,960
Oh my God.

2098
02:02:12,960 --> 02:02:18,760
Yeah, you're holding on to the balls and you just start to slip

2099
02:02:18,760 --> 02:02:21,560
off the balls and they start to turn up again.

2100
02:02:21,560 --> 02:02:25,760
So this is a smaller pig that I'm used to.

2101
02:02:25,760 --> 02:02:29,520
I don't really know what I'm doing.

2102
02:02:29,520 --> 02:02:36,880
Yeah, so you'll have to make an athletics check again next turn to make that work.

2103
02:02:36,880 --> 02:02:39,520
Now it is your turn.

2104
02:02:39,520 --> 02:02:41,520
Your turn, Davinder.

2105
02:02:41,520 --> 02:02:43,200
Okay, me.

2106
02:02:43,200 --> 02:02:50,240
So Davinder is now going to try to, oh, you know what I should do, by the way?

2107
02:02:50,240 --> 02:02:51,240
Sorry.

2108
02:02:51,240 --> 02:02:52,560
You could take this out of the recording.

2109
02:02:52,560 --> 02:02:53,560
I won't.

2110
02:02:53,560 --> 02:02:54,560
Okay.

2111
02:02:54,560 --> 02:02:57,780
You always do that when I ask so it's sort of like why am I

2112
02:02:57,780 --> 02:03:06,160
No, there's no there's no free. You know it in roll 20. There are no free ocelot assets. So

2113
02:03:06,160 --> 02:03:13,840
Get on that roll 20 instead I will put the closest thing I can think of which is a

2114
02:03:13,840 --> 02:03:17,160
fat tiger

2115
02:03:17,160 --> 02:03:20,960

2129
02:03:57,920 --> 02:04:00,560
Dieter to try to convince this ocelot

2130
02:04:00,560 --> 02:04:04,020
to be on your side. You've already persuaded it enough.

2131
02:04:04,020 --> 02:04:07,240
Yeah, I feel like this ocelot wouldn't have been here unless I sniffed the room.

2132
02:04:07,240 --> 02:04:10,960
Yeah, no, you figured it out. You figured out that there was an ocelot in here.

2133
02:04:10,960 --> 02:04:13,120
uh... okay uh...

2134
02:04:13,120 --> 02:04:16,440

or hit the uh...

2171
02:05:58,560 --> 02:06:01,060

hit that nozzle shooting propane mysteriously from the floor

2178
02:06:17,500 --> 02:06:21,740
any shrink down the flame it's it's gets bottled up more buying yourself a little

2179
02:06:21,740 --> 02:06:23,940
bit more time that's good because you were

2180
02:06:23,940 --> 02:06:26,220
you're running out of time obviously uh... so now

is anything gonna happen

2186
02:06:39,820 --> 02:06:44,020
on that nozzle no it's a sort of down as much as you can you can choose a book

2187
02:06:44,020 --> 02:06:46,560
i thought we are to get both the nozzles

2188
02:06:46,560 --> 02:06:47,700
television is there

2189
02:06:47,700 --> 02:06:49,420

the flame that popped up

2191
02:06:50,740 --> 02:06:52,380
what the hell

2192
02:06:52,380 --> 02:06:55,180
yes we are not sure i'll shoot the new nozzle then

2193
02:06:55,180 --> 02:06:57,560

2198
02:07:06,820 --> 02:07:07,940
Yeah!

2199
02:07:07,940 --> 02:07:09,700
Yeah!

2200
02:07:09,700 --> 02:07:11,540
So it's never gonna produce a flame again?

2201
02:07:11,540 --> 02:07:12,420
No, it's producing-

2202
02:07:12,420 --> 02:07:13,940
It's never gonna produce a flame again.

2203
02:07:13,940 --> 02:07:15,940
It's never gonna produce a flame again!

2204
02:07:15,940 --> 02:07:17,220
That's what- that's what-

2205
02:07:17,220 --> 02:07:18,980
That's what Jigsaw promised.

2206
02:07:18,980 --> 02:07:19,480
He said-

2207
02:07:19,480 --> 02:07:21,480
*overlapping*

2208
02:07:21,480 --> 02:07:23,480
Did Jigsaw promising you something he didn't?

2209
02:07:23,480 --> 02:07:23,980
Yeah.

2210
02:07:23,980 --> 02:07:25,980
Jigsaw pinky promised me with this-

2211
02:07:25,980 --> 02:07:27,980
*overlapping*

2212
02:07:27,980 --> 02:07:29,980
I have a false flashback on-

2213
02:07:29,980 --> 02:07:31,980
*overlapping*

2214
02:07:31,980 --> 02:07:32,980
Stop having a false memory.

2215
02:07:32,980 --> 02:07:34,980
Do not have a false memory.

2216
02:07:35,980 --> 02:07:39,700
yeah i have a false memory to to finding

2217
02:07:39,700 --> 02:07:42,380
or to this dungeon and i think it's deadly

2218
02:07:42,380 --> 02:07:45,460
and that's that's that's a big kidnap tonight

2219
02:07:45,460 --> 02:07:46,980
and i think

2220
02:07:46,980 --> 02:07:49,500
and

2221
02:07:49,500 --> 02:07:52,700
i have a flashback to what i survived all the traps and got away

2222
02:07:52,700 --> 02:07:56,380
and i think that's right away deter

2223
02:07:56,380 --> 02:08:01,300
uh... alright i guess i can't stand this kind of fun with the pitchfork again

2224
02:08:01,300 --> 02:08:02,500
so she also

2225
02:08:02,500 --> 02:08:05,580
but i think it'll focus realize that uh...

2226
02:08:05,580 --> 02:08:06,700
who

2227
02:08:06,700 --> 02:08:08,940
because it's a six twice

2228
02:08:08,940 --> 02:08:10,900
and begin three back

2229
02:08:10,900 --> 02:08:12,500
uh...

2230
02:08:12,500 --> 02:08:15,580
and instead of my pitchfork

2231
02:08:15,580 --> 02:08:16,900
before

2232
02:08:16,900 --> 02:08:19,660
yet it's role for damage

2233
02:08:19,660 --> 02:08:22,420
and i see it describe your killing your experiment

2234
02:08:22,420 --> 02:08:24,100
all he's dead

2235
02:08:24,100 --> 02:08:27,220
yet you didn't sit on damage him earlier

2236
02:08:27,220 --> 02:08:29,540
uh...

2237
02:08:29,540 --> 02:08:34,040
Yeah, I stab him in the belly and a few tears leave his eyes.

2238
02:08:34,040 --> 02:08:37,540
It was the closest thing to a family member he's ever had.

2239
02:08:37,540 --> 02:08:41,040
Far closer than the stupid fucking horror of the Mother's Thoughts.

2240
02:08:41,040 --> 02:08:42,540
Shut up! I loved her!

2241
02:08:42,540 --> 02:08:44,540
You can't hear my thoughts.

2242
02:08:44,540 --> 02:08:46,540
Yes I can!

2243
02:08:46,540 --> 02:08:49,040
Oh right, because we have a telepathic bond.

2244
02:08:49,040 --> 02:08:51,540
Yeah, right.

2245
02:08:51,540 --> 02:08:52,540
Why?

2246
02:08:52,540 --> 02:08:56,540
Yeah, so I see his life flash before my eyes.

2247
02:08:58,540 --> 02:09:00,140
and uh...

2248
02:09:00,140 --> 02:09:04,020
see him remembering getting a frog body and remembering getting doug benson's

2249
02:09:04,020 --> 02:09:08,140
legs attached to him. See if he'll remember how to set up the uh... the

2250
02:09:08,140 --> 02:09:09,220
propane

2251
02:09:09,220 --> 02:09:11,620
yeah right yeah i'm scanning

2252
02:09:11,620 --> 02:09:15,340
well i don't know if he set up the trap i feel like the trap was set up by jigsaw.

2253
02:09:15,340 --> 02:09:18,820
yeah no the memories you see from him though are of him

2254
02:09:18,820 --> 02:09:23,540
bagging all of you and bringing you here. Oh my god. He was jigsaw's assistant.

2255
02:09:23,540 --> 02:09:27,420
oh jesus alright he was the one who tied us to the maypole he touched my penis i can

2256
02:09:27,420 --> 02:09:31,100
see that very clearly. Yeah, you see him touching your penis, you see him lingering a little.

2257
02:09:31,100 --> 02:09:35,420
The flashback, the flashback from earlier where I blacked out and it was a ringing sound.

2258
02:09:35,420 --> 02:09:38,380
I look down and it's David Dirk.

2259
02:09:38,380 --> 02:09:52,460
Um, I wanted to be a porn star and he just slowly dies. Yeah, um, oh fuck there was something I uh,

2260
02:09:52,460 --> 02:09:57,340
Oh yeah, as he s- as the life leaves his eyes, I start to salivate and then I eat his corpse.

2261
02:09:57,340 --> 02:10:01,260
Oh yeah, I forgot.

2262
02:10:01,260 --> 02:10:03,420
Yeah.

2263
02:10:03,420 --> 02:10:07,340
And then his purpose is finally fulfilled. He was bred for meat.

2264
02:10:07,340 --> 02:10:14,300
After you belch out a bone, like a cartoon, uh, you then belt her with three of the most

2265
02:10:14,300 --> 02:10:19,740
delicious meats, a frog and Doug Benson and whatever the other one was.

2266
02:10:19,740 --> 02:10:20,060
Dog.

2267
02:10:22,220 --> 02:10:24,460
And you also belch out a key.

2268
02:10:24,460 --> 02:10:26,220
Oh, awesome.

2269
02:10:26,220 --> 02:10:27,020
The key to the door.

2270
02:10:27,020 --> 02:10:28,860
I have to look for the key.

2271
02:10:28,860 --> 02:10:30,300
I'm ready to die at this point.

2272
02:10:30,300 --> 02:10:31,660
I don't care if I get out.

2273
02:10:31,660 --> 02:10:38,700
Yeah, and so, yeah, you can now get out of there.

2274
02:10:38,700 --> 02:10:42,220
You know, you all get out of there.

2275
02:10:42,220 --> 02:10:43,820
You all sort of defeat the...

2276
02:10:43,820 --> 02:10:45,820
You crawl out of the pig as fast as you can.

2277
02:10:45,820 --> 02:10:48,140
I'm still trying so hard to jack off the pig

2278
02:10:48,140 --> 02:10:49,820
because I haven't gotten the news yet.

2279
02:10:51,820 --> 02:10:54,620
- He's inside the pig, I'm fucking jacking it off.

2280
02:10:54,620 --> 02:10:56,880
(laughing)

2281
02:10:56,880 --> 02:11:01,180
- The flames slowly subside.

2282
02:11:01,180 --> 02:11:02,860
- I think of Charlotte's Web.

2283
02:11:02,860 --> 02:11:05,700
- Pulling on a big pig dick.

2284
02:11:05,700 --> 02:11:07,460
- The flames slowly subside,

2285
02:11:07,460 --> 02:11:09,460
you're just spinning around on this pig

2286
02:11:09,460 --> 02:11:10,900
trying to jerk it off.

2287
02:11:10,900 --> 02:11:15,660
And the door, you have the key to the door now,

2288
02:11:15,660 --> 02:11:17,420
so you can all go to the next room.

2289
02:11:19,700 --> 02:11:22,700
well i also have a retreat the oscillator my way out

2290
02:11:22,700 --> 02:11:24,580
yes you can you may

2291
02:11:24,580 --> 02:11:28,900
yet he's charmed so she's yours

2292
02:11:28,900 --> 02:11:31,140
uh... i have to enter into the next room

2293
02:11:31,140 --> 02:11:34,760
uh... home i guess i already have two wives at this point so i also just

2294
02:11:34,760 --> 02:11:36,540
proposed to her also

2295
02:11:36,540 --> 02:11:39,820
yes she says yes she's like i love being married

2296
02:11:39,820 --> 02:11:41,300
and she had a yeah

2297
02:11:41,300 --> 02:11:44,660
uh... three wives right now

2298
02:11:44,660 --> 02:11:47,840
and so now you're in the wish i thought of that

2299
02:11:47,840 --> 02:11:50,640
uh... and your jigsaw

2300
02:11:50,640 --> 02:11:52,160
say arm

2301
02:11:52,160 --> 02:11:55,480
so i didn't again i didn't know there is going to be a fourth guy

2302
02:11:55,480 --> 02:11:57,400
what's up

2303
02:11:57,400 --> 02:12:00,600
i didn't have a lot of time uh...

2304
02:12:00,600 --> 02:12:02,680
that's my nephew adam

2305
02:12:02,680 --> 02:12:05,840
uh...

2306
02:12:05,840 --> 02:12:07,520
i gave him a gun

2307
02:12:07,520 --> 02:12:10,320
and uh... i see a mickey he's like

2308
02:12:10,320 --> 02:12:12,560
you see him as i thought he's like texting

2309
02:12:12,560 --> 02:12:15,000
uh... it looks up

2310
02:12:15,000 --> 02:12:16,800
and what looks back down

2311
02:12:16,800 --> 02:12:19,960
and uh... you have to uh...

2312
02:12:19,960 --> 02:12:24,220
the trap is uh... he's gonna show you with the gun

2313
02:12:24,220 --> 02:12:26,680
that

2314
02:12:26,680 --> 02:12:27,760
uh...

2315
02:12:27,760 --> 02:12:32,160
i don't have any visuals in here either i can see what's going on

2316
02:12:32,160 --> 02:12:36,080
i really didn't have any time to set this room up it's not a problem

2317
02:12:36,080 --> 02:12:39,240
i'm really you know i feel bad for you again

2318
02:12:39,240 --> 02:12:42,380
jenna died did not mean for this to happen

2319
02:12:42,380 --> 02:12:45,640
and frankly they're all you've all survived i'm feeling

2320
02:12:45,640 --> 02:12:47,600
pretty pretty bummed out right now

2321
02:12:47,600 --> 02:12:49,600
and while he's like so saying this

2322
02:12:49,600 --> 02:12:51,960
you see adam's writing on a piece of paper

2323
02:12:51,960 --> 02:12:54,680
he's saying again i can't hear any of this

2324
02:12:54,680 --> 02:12:56,940
uh... i can see anything that's going on in there

2325
02:12:56,940 --> 02:12:58,960
uh... you see it but uh... you know

2326
02:12:58,960 --> 02:13:01,080
uh... you see adam hold up the piece of paper

2327
02:13:01,080 --> 02:13:02,880
and show it to you guys

2328
02:13:02,880 --> 02:13:04,600
uh...

2329
02:13:04,600 --> 02:13:06,580
and uh... uh...

2330
02:13:06,580 --> 02:13:08,300
it says uh...

2331
02:13:08,300 --> 02:13:11,520
underneath the desk lamp there's a switch that'll open the door

2332
02:13:11,520 --> 02:13:14,080
can one of you stab me in the leg or something so it could look like i

2333
02:13:14,080 --> 02:13:31,080
I

2334
02:13:31,080 --> 02:13:44,680
is

2335
02:13:44,680 --> 02:13:52,140
I was like like like here's like very faintly like laugh track and she's like what's what's happening in there. Shut up, bitch

2336
02:13:52,140 --> 02:13:55,520
What do you always do this?

2337
02:13:55,520 --> 02:14:06,760
I attack the nephew. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. I've always wanted to be in a fight

2338
02:14:06,760 --> 02:14:13,620
Nothing that we just did

2339
02:14:14,000 --> 02:14:16,940
Yeah, wow my own room

2340
02:14:16,940 --> 02:14:25,700
Yeah roll the tack roll do I need to roll initiative first or

2341
02:14:25,700 --> 02:14:30,280
I know I'm just I'm just kidding a surprise round on this nephew

2342
02:14:30,280 --> 02:14:34,720
All right. Yeah roll initiative because it will be combat if you don't kill it, which you can very easily

2343
02:14:34,720 --> 02:14:37,400
But I had to hurt him. He is just a teenager

2344
02:14:37,400 --> 02:14:40,760
Oh

2345
02:14:40,760 --> 02:14:43,480
Yeah, you're just rolling to hurt him then yeah roll

2346
02:14:43,480 --> 02:14:45,480
So yeah, he lets you, um...

2347
02:14:45,480 --> 02:14:48,480
You hit him. What do you do with the Bible?

2348
02:14:48,480 --> 02:14:50,480
What do you do?

2349
02:14:50,480 --> 02:14:52,480
Am I using my Bible?

2350
02:14:52,480 --> 02:14:54,480
Well, how are you hitting him?

2351
02:14:54,480 --> 02:14:56,480
I guess that's my only attack.

2352
02:14:56,480 --> 02:14:58,480
Can I give Caleb my gun?

2353
02:14:58,480 --> 02:15:00,480
Yeah, okay. He gives me the gun.

2354
02:15:00,480 --> 02:15:02,480
I also give Caleb my gun.

2355
02:15:02,480 --> 02:15:04,480
Caleb also has my gun at this point.

2356
02:15:04,480 --> 02:15:06,480
Guns.

2357
02:15:06,480 --> 02:15:08,480
I mean Jedediah. I give Jedediah my gun.

2358
02:15:08,480 --> 02:15:10,480
Yeah, right.

2359
02:15:10,480 --> 02:15:12,480
I use all of them to shoot him in the kneecaps.

2360
02:15:12,480 --> 02:15:19,520
Okay, shit, roll, I guess, roll an attack roll for just a d20.

2361
02:15:19,520 --> 02:15:20,520
That's three attacks.

2362
02:15:20,520 --> 02:15:21,520
Just do forward slash.

2363
02:15:21,520 --> 02:15:22,520
That's three guns.

2364
02:15:22,520 --> 02:15:23,520
Okay, thank God.

2365
02:15:23,520 --> 02:15:24,520
Yeah, you just clearly missed his teenage...

2366
02:15:24,520 --> 02:15:25,520
We're just going, "What the fuck, dude?

2367
02:15:25,520 --> 02:15:26,520
What the fuck?"

2368
02:15:26,520 --> 02:15:27,520
Your note said to hurt you.

2369
02:15:27,520 --> 02:15:28,520
Not to shoot you.

2370
02:15:28,520 --> 02:15:29,520
What note?

2371
02:15:29,520 --> 02:15:30,520
What is he talking about?

2372
02:15:30,520 --> 02:15:31,520
Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

2373
02:15:31,520 --> 02:15:32,520
Are you seeing this?

2374
02:15:32,520 --> 02:15:33,520
Are you seeing this?

2375
02:15:33,520 --> 02:15:34,520
Are you seeing this?

2376
02:15:34,520 --> 02:15:35,520
Are you seeing this?

2377
02:15:35,520 --> 02:15:36,520
Are you seeing this?

2378
02:15:36,520 --> 02:15:37,520
Are you seeing this?

2379
02:15:37,520 --> 02:15:38,520
Are you seeing this?

2380
02:15:38,520 --> 02:15:39,520
Are you seeing this?

2381
02:15:39,520 --> 02:15:40,520
Are you seeing this?

2382
02:15:40,520 --> 02:15:41,520
Are you seeing this?

2383
02:15:41,520 --> 02:15:47,800
I see the kid like runs, like grabs his pencil he used to write the note and just stabs himself

2384
02:15:47,800 --> 02:15:48,800
in the leg.

2385
02:15:48,800 --> 02:15:52,560
He's like, "Get the fuck out of here!" and just yells at you.

2386
02:15:52,560 --> 02:15:56,560
I slap him in the face.

2387
02:15:56,560 --> 02:16:00,840
I also, I also, I throw the shillelagh at him again.

2388
02:16:00,840 --> 02:16:03,520
Yeah, he throws shillelagh at him again.

2389
02:16:03,520 --> 02:16:06,000
Yeah, he's, roll an attack roll.

2390
02:16:06,000 --> 02:16:08,680
Okay, roll for damage.

2391
02:16:08,680 --> 02:16:11,480
Uh, yeah, describe your kill on this weapon.

2392
02:16:11,480 --> 02:16:13,480
*laughter*

2393
02:16:13,480 --> 02:16:15,480
I...

2394
02:16:15,480 --> 02:16:17,480
He's not like a person that you could think, he's just a regular NPC.

2395
02:16:17,480 --> 02:16:19,480
Oh, he's dead now.

2396
02:16:19,480 --> 02:16:24,480
I throw the shillelagh's head so hard that it hits off.

2397
02:16:24,480 --> 02:16:31,480
Like, just this whole, the whole right side of his head goes back into the wall.

2398
02:16:31,480 --> 02:16:34,480
With the shillelagh and the shillelagh stuck in the wall, I can't even get it out.

2399
02:16:34,480 --> 02:16:36,480
Okay.

2400
02:16:36,480 --> 02:16:38,480
Yeah, you do that, you murder this boy.

2401
02:16:38,480 --> 02:16:40,000
(laughing)

2402
02:16:40,000 --> 02:16:42,600
Even though he was trying to get you out.

2403
02:16:42,600 --> 02:16:44,600
And you go to the lamp, you lift it up,

2404
02:16:44,600 --> 02:16:49,360
you press the switch, you open the door, you've done it.

2405
02:16:49,360 --> 02:16:52,480
You've solved the saw, jigsaw,

2406
02:16:52,480 --> 02:16:54,200
and you step outside of the room.

2407
02:16:54,200 --> 02:16:59,080
And you notice that everything is kind of weird.

2408
02:16:59,080 --> 02:17:01,600
All four of you as you step outside.

2409
02:17:01,600 --> 02:17:03,240
- Everything is kind of weird.

2410
02:17:03,240 --> 02:17:04,320
(laughing)

2411
02:17:04,320 --> 02:17:06,320
I was just about to say that, dude.

2412
02:17:06,320 --> 02:17:07,160
(laughing)

2413
02:17:07,160 --> 02:17:09,480
"Something's funny about this."

2414
02:17:09,480 --> 02:17:13,240
It's all really green, and it's all very salty.

2415
02:17:13,240 --> 02:17:18,760
And you start to remember, you have a flashback to a jigsaw saying,

2416
02:17:18,760 --> 02:17:22,240
"Quite the pickle you're in."

2417
02:17:22,240 --> 02:17:25,000
And you start to go forward in time.

2418
02:17:25,000 --> 02:17:31,280
And you see that you're in the karaoke room and the microphone is a pickle.

2419
02:17:31,280 --> 02:17:34,680
And you go further and then the plane is a pickle.

2420
02:17:34,680 --> 02:17:37,960
You just realized that pig that was spinning was not a pig, it was a pickle.

2421
02:17:37,960 --> 02:17:40,960
And the nephew you just killed, you look down, "It's pickle, Rick."

2422
02:17:40,960 --> 02:17:44,480
And you now are realizing that you are literally inside of a pickle.

2423
02:17:44,480 --> 02:17:46,600
- You're trapped inside of a pickle. - I knew it.

2424
02:17:46,600 --> 02:17:52,320
And the camera slowly zooms out, and you're in a jar of pickles.

2425
02:17:52,320 --> 02:17:56,560
And you see a hand reach into the pickle jar and take a bite out of it.

2426
02:17:56,560 --> 02:17:58,960
- And who is that hand? - A jar?

2427
02:17:58,960 --> 02:18:01,840
It's a jar. You're in a jar. You're in a pickle.

2428
02:18:01,840 --> 02:18:04,840
inside of a jar of pickles. That's the saw twist.

2429
02:18:04,840 --> 02:18:09,840
And the hand that reaches in, that takes out the pickle and takes a bite, who is it?

2430
02:18:09,840 --> 02:18:12,840
It's Black Hamtaro from the anime Hamtaro.

2431
02:18:12,840 --> 02:18:14,840
Good night, everybody.

2432
02:18:14,840 --> 02:18:25,840
One of the most clever plot twists in the series, I have to say.

2433
02:18:25,840 --> 02:18:28,840
I was trying to think of the dumbest plot twist possible.

2434
02:18:28,840 --> 02:18:30,840
I think you got close.

2435
02:18:30,840 --> 02:18:31,840
Yeah, thanks.

2436
02:18:31,840 --> 02:18:34,840
Wow, that was something else.

2437
02:18:34,840 --> 02:18:37,840
What was the... the black Hamtaro was named Oswald, right?

2438
02:18:37,840 --> 02:18:38,840
I don't remember his name.

2439
02:18:38,840 --> 02:18:40,840
Patrick definitely watched Hamtaro.

2440
02:18:40,840 --> 02:18:42,840
I watched Hamtaro's key.

2441
02:18:42,840 --> 02:18:44,840
Yeah, his name is Oswald or something.

2442
02:18:44,840 --> 02:18:46,840
Something similar.

2443
02:18:46,840 --> 02:18:50,840
He's like... his tattoo is starting to itch.

2444
02:18:50,840 --> 02:18:52,840
Alright, happy Halloween everybody.

2445
02:18:52,840 --> 02:18:53,840
Happy Halloween.

2446
02:18:53,840 --> 02:18:55,840
I'm gonna stop the recording now.

2447
02:18:55,840 --> 02:18:58,600
