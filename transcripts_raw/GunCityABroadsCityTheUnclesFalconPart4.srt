[Music]

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Last time on Gun City Stories, a broad city, the Uncle's Falcon.

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,000
The crew stood before a mysterious door in the abandoned porno factory.

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
And what they found behind it was hard to believe.

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,000
A fully furnished Technoslime lab with prototype machinery and Technoslime apparatuses.

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,000
One not even approved by the Stakehams Federation of Bodies and Spaces.

7
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,920
that Patrick Yoda had encountered in Mommy's bathroom.

8
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:38,120
Ray William Johnson drank an entire vial of the stuff and went on an Evangelion-type odyssey

9
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:40,800
where his body and soul melted into one thing.

10
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:42,280
Big bitches.

11
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:45,980
He awoke from the trance, able to search the room with the aplomb of a truly great detective

12
00:00:45,980 --> 00:00:47,640
like Sherlock Holmes.

13
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:52,680
Underneath a pile of Maxim magazines he discovered a blueprint which had something called "The

14
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:58,880
Coculus Rift 2.0, the Coculus Quest, Cordless Experience, with pictures of vivisected penises

15
00:00:58,880 --> 00:00:59,880
on it.

16
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:03,280
"The name at the bottom of the blueprint said Dr. Twolateralis."

17
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:08,600
Suddenly, the Iron Guardians burst back into the factory, realizing that they were tricked

18
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:10,880
by the wily Blotas Piss.

19
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:15,360
A great battle ensued and Blotas almost died, but luckily Patrick Yoda brought down the hurt

20
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:19,120
with his hoagie surprise for a devastating blow.

21
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:22,840
The mess got the attention of the Jollibee police force along with police captain Filipino

22
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:24,180
Mr. Bean.

23
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:27,880
He warned the boys to not get too ahead of themselves in this case.

24
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:29,800
But good job finding those Iron Guardians.

25
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:35,480
It seems they were, much like the Technoslime Red Eye drugs, not approved by Stakehams and

26
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:38,600
have been making appearances throughout Gun City and causing mayhem.

27
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:43,600
They are V-folks, with an X of course, that can actually cause harm to real people, a terrifying

28
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:44,880
prospect.

29
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:48,720
The boys booked it out of there before Filipino Mr. Bean could finish questioning them, and

30
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:53,880
slept at their respective abodes. Patrick Yoda on his hoverboard outside of a tattoo parlor,

31
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:58,000
Blotas Piss in some kind of endless Russian doll refraction of holiday refuse in the middle

32
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:03,680
of the park, and Ray William Johnson three and a half inches deep inside his wife Cameron.

33
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:07,760
The next morning, the boys went with Sullivan to Mommy Good Lakes, where she opined about

34
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:12,920
the value of the Matrix 2, V-Folks, Beauty, and spoke of her suspicions of sabotage. Our

35
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:18,400
Our heroes talked about eating poop and had I think canon gay sex with one another and

36
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:20,120
posted it online to ebay.

37
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:27,600
I'm not sure if that was cut out or not.

38
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:31,520
We haven't edited that episode yet so there's really no way to know whether that happened

39
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:32,520
or not.

40
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:34,240
Alright I'm making a call right now.

41
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:35,240
It's in.

42
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:37,500
(laughing)

43
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:40,580
- Yeah, it really got towards the end, it got.

44
00:02:40,580 --> 00:02:41,420
Anyway.

45
00:02:41,420 --> 00:02:44,060
(laughing)

46
00:02:44,060 --> 00:02:46,460
- Mommy brought them to the secret Jack In chamber

47
00:02:46,460 --> 00:02:48,140
at the bottom of Mommy's good legs,

48
00:02:48,140 --> 00:02:49,660
then informed the boys of a plan

49
00:02:49,660 --> 00:02:51,980
to check the Jacked In archives and records offices

50
00:02:51,980 --> 00:02:53,920
in the United Health Group Incorporated

51
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:56,180
in Marlborough District to figure out

52
00:02:56,180 --> 00:02:59,160
when Sean McKelvey left Jacked In.

53
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:00,140
Once they confirmed that,

54
00:03:00,140 --> 00:03:01,340
Mommy will feel more comfortable

55
00:03:01,340 --> 00:03:03,300
helping them get into The Matrix 2,

56
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:04,900
and they can go in after Sean,

57
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:06,500
if he's even in there.

58
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:08,980
The boys now sit in the secret jacked-in chamber

59
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:10,580
underneath Mommy Goodleg's club,

60
00:03:10,580 --> 00:03:12,460
debating whether they should do this heist

61
00:03:12,460 --> 00:03:14,580
or see what there are,

62
00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:16,700
see what other options there are.

63
00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:19,500
But before we do that, they have to level up.

64
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:20,340
That's right.

65
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:23,280
In this arc, we're going to watch our heroes level up.

66
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:24,980
Now, everything that's been made for them

67
00:03:24,980 --> 00:03:26,140
is extremely homebrew,

68
00:03:26,140 --> 00:03:28,740
so I've come up with some tweaks of my own

69
00:03:28,740 --> 00:03:30,740
that they can pick and choose what they want

70
00:03:30,740 --> 00:03:31,560
at this level up.

71
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:33,940
At this point, I think the narrator should stop talking.

72
00:03:33,940 --> 00:03:35,940
Okay, that's what I did.

73
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:39,060
Things to remind you guys after this.

74
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:40,540
Patrick, you now have the Needler.

75
00:03:40,540 --> 00:03:41,720
You can check your inventory.

76
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:42,860
I updated that.

77
00:03:42,860 --> 00:03:45,060
You have the attack for the Needler as well.

78
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:46,740
If you have any more,

79
00:03:46,740 --> 00:03:49,300
if you want any more information about that,

80
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:50,340
I have a little note.

81
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:52,260
- You can go to Needler.com.

82
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:54,020
- Yeah, you can go to Needler.com.

83
00:03:54,020 --> 00:03:55,300
- HaloNeedler.com.

84
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:57,420
- HaloNeedler.com/Patrick.

85
00:03:57,420 --> 00:03:59,460
And you'll find what your Needler does.

86
00:03:59,460 --> 00:04:01,580
Caleb. - Yeah.

87
00:04:01,580 --> 00:04:04,500
You have two more servings of raw Techno Slime.

88
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:05,960
So, um, those-

89
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:07,460
- Just fucking go.

90
00:04:07,460 --> 00:04:09,100
- Like last time, those will give you advantage

91
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:10,700
on like every kind of check,

92
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:14,500
and recharge your Techno Slime points.

93
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:15,820
But the next day you will have disadvantage

94
00:04:15,820 --> 00:04:17,540
on all Dex tech, Dex checks,

95
00:04:17,540 --> 00:04:19,060
which is what you're going through right now.

96
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:20,580
So like, you're kind of like wobbly.

97
00:04:20,580 --> 00:04:24,380
Like you can't really like handle what's going on.

98
00:04:24,380 --> 00:04:25,980
If you take it again though, today,

99
00:04:25,980 --> 00:04:27,600
while you're like in withdrawal,

100
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,460
you will be fully addicted to Techno Slime

101
00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:30,940
and have to deal with those consequences

102
00:04:30,940 --> 00:04:33,280
that are in the techno slime addiction system.

103
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:35,280
- So if you want to take it again, you can.

104
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:37,180
- I was going to say, I just take both right now,

105
00:04:37,180 --> 00:04:40,440
but I guess I'll allow you to live.

106
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:41,280
Yeah.

107
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:44,400
Cameron, a reminder this time,

108
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:46,380
you have a monkey named Patrick.

109
00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:50,080
- The monkey this entire-

110
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:53,360
- You've forgotten, even in the first Gun City thing,

111
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:54,200
you forgot about it.

112
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:55,680
- I literally made a note.

113
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:57,360
- It's a quiet monkey.

114
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:58,180
All right.

115
00:04:58,180 --> 00:04:59,020
He's very quiet.

116
00:04:59,020 --> 00:05:08,020
This entire campaign, the monkey has been inside my jacket pocket and zipped up inside.

117
00:05:08,020 --> 00:05:12,220
He's completely quiet.

118
00:05:12,220 --> 00:05:15,020
But I made that note to remind you of that.

119
00:05:15,020 --> 00:05:18,540
I'm going to try to do that for every recap going forward.

120
00:05:18,540 --> 00:05:19,540
So we have like...

121
00:05:19,540 --> 00:05:20,540
Just tell me I have a monkey.

122
00:05:20,540 --> 00:05:22,020
Yeah, that in particular.

123
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:26,620
But yeah, so level up, folks.

124
00:05:26,620 --> 00:05:37,100
So, for anybody listening at home who is a 5e, D&D 5e person, I sort of based all three

125
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:43,620
of their classes off of different sort of, so like Caleb, I sort of based him off of

126
00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:51,300
a warlock, Cameron off of fighter, and Patrick Yoda off of, kind of based off like a druid

127
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:56,460
mixed with like a fighter because it gave them some like more physical chops and

128
00:05:56,460 --> 00:05:59,340
then from there I mixed around the proficiencies and I mixed around a bunch

129
00:05:59,340 --> 00:06:04,100
of abilities and stuff. Can you pull up that uh that level up tree again?

130
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:11,220
I closed out of mine. Absolutely yeah and so what I did is I made a like sort of my

131
00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:14,340
own sort of level up system where it's kind of a little bit more resembling a

132
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:19,020
video game where you can choose a subclass to start putting points in and

133
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:21,020
and then choose an ability within that.

134
00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:24,860
I'll probably post these on the Discord at some point

135
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:28,060
to show people, because I think it's kind of fun and interesting.

136
00:06:28,060 --> 00:06:30,060
They're cool.

137
00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:32,060
I used draw.io.

138
00:06:32,060 --> 00:06:35,560
If you guys are looking for flowchart applications,

139
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:37,560
it's a really good one.

140
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:39,560
First thing that you guys should know about your level up.

141
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:43,560
All of you guys, regardless of your...

142
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:48,060
You're all going to increase your total Tecto Slime points by 25%.

143
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:51,140
Next, we're going to increase your hit points.

144
00:06:51,140 --> 00:06:52,860
- So... - Better not.

145
00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:54,260
Yeah, it's gonna be different for each one.

146
00:06:54,260 --> 00:06:56,540
All right, Patrick doesn't get to increase his hit points.

147
00:06:56,540 --> 00:06:57,540
- He doesn't want to. - Yeah, Patrick doesn't.

148
00:06:57,540 --> 00:06:59,380
- Don't make him increase his. - No, I want them now.

149
00:06:59,380 --> 00:07:00,500
- I don't. - Okay.

150
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:02,980
- I do. - So, what you guys need to do

151
00:07:02,980 --> 00:07:06,020
is, again, 'cause I based this off the class that you were.

152
00:07:06,020 --> 00:07:08,740
- So, first, Cameron. - Yeah.

153
00:07:08,740 --> 00:07:14,060
Roll 1d10 and add your constitution to that.

154
00:07:14,060 --> 00:07:15,660
And that will be how much your hit points increase.

155
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:16,540
All right.

156
00:07:16,540 --> 00:07:17,740
Nice, that's gonna be pretty good.

157
00:07:17,740 --> 00:07:19,500
Six plus one, seven.

158
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:20,340
Nice, seven.

159
00:07:20,340 --> 00:07:21,940
So you increase your hit points by seven.

160
00:07:21,940 --> 00:07:23,020
Cool.

161
00:07:23,020 --> 00:07:24,660
Patrick Yoda.

162
00:07:24,660 --> 00:07:27,100
You will roll a D8.

163
00:07:27,100 --> 00:07:27,920
Okay.

164
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:29,580
So like forward slash R.

165
00:07:29,580 --> 00:07:31,100
Nice, hell yeah, dog.

166
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:32,740
So like, see how it's like three

167
00:07:32,740 --> 00:07:34,700
on the left side of your character sheet?

168
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:35,540
Yeah.

169
00:07:35,540 --> 00:07:36,360
That's your constitution bonus.

170
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:37,820
You add three to four.

171
00:07:37,820 --> 00:07:39,740
So you add seven. Can you do that, Pat?

172
00:07:39,740 --> 00:07:40,580
(Patrick laughs)

173
00:07:40,580 --> 00:07:42,540
So I have seven constitution now?

174
00:07:42,540 --> 00:07:43,380
There it is.

175
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:44,520
No, so you have seven,

176
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:46,640
You add 7 hit points to your max now.

177
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:48,360
So now you're at 34 hit points.

178
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:49,840
Okay, nice.

179
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:54,280
And then, uh, Caleb, you have, um,

180
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:56,360
I don't remember, I don't think Warlocks are 1d6,

181
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:57,760
but I guess I was basing yours off Wizard.

182
00:07:57,760 --> 00:07:59,880
So you roll a d6.

183
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:02,400
Caleb's a certain type of Wizard.

184
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:03,280
Yep.

185
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:04,440
Very high Wizard.

186
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:05,960
A cool Wizard.

187
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:07,160
He did very well in that roll.

188
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:08,680
So now just add your Constitution to that

189
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:10,800
and then add that to your total hit points.

190
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:12,400
Okay, hold on.

191
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:14,880
My constitution bonus of two?

192
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:15,380
Yes, sorry.

193
00:08:15,380 --> 00:08:15,880
Yeah.

194
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:16,380
Okay.

195
00:08:16,380 --> 00:08:16,880
Yes.

196
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:17,380
Gotcha.

197
00:08:17,380 --> 00:08:18,380
So that puts me at 31.

198
00:08:18,380 --> 00:08:18,880
Nice.

199
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:19,380
Okay.

200
00:08:19,380 --> 00:08:19,880
Cool.

201
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:21,880
And then, yeah, yeah, your technical points.

202
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:22,380
Great.

203
00:08:22,380 --> 00:08:25,880
So that's the stuff that needs to, that's just like sort of maintenance stuff.

204
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:29,880
So now, is I've given you guys two points.

205
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:36,380
So if you look at your tree, each of your trees, I don't know if you guys, can you guys pull them all up?

206
00:08:36,380 --> 00:08:37,380
Yeah, I got mine.

207
00:08:37,380 --> 00:08:38,380
I'm seeing it.

208
00:08:38,380 --> 00:08:38,880
I'm looking at it.

209
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:39,380
Good.

210
00:08:39,380 --> 00:08:40,380
I read through the stuff.

211
00:08:40,380 --> 00:08:40,880
Awesome.

212
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:41,880
Perfect.

213
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:45,120
So if you spend one point, you unlock a subclass.

214
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:50,000
So for Blotaspis, your subclasses are,

215
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,740
you're a Grinch Hunter is your class,

216
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:52,800
is what I've called it.

217
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:53,640
- Yes.

218
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:54,600
- Your subclasses are Grinch Killer,

219
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:56,400
Gun Sniffer and Shadow Who.

220
00:08:56,400 --> 00:09:00,000
Each of these have different abilities

221
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,360
that you can then unlock with an additional ability point.

222
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:05,440
Once you unlock a subclass though,

223
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:07,760
it's gonna cost two ability points

224
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:09,640
to unlock the next subclass.

225
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:11,600
So you can't really unlock more than one subclass

226
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:17,920
level up. So, if you unlock Grinch Killer, you're gonna get +1 to your strength. If you

227
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:21,960
unlock Gun Sniffer, +1 to your DEX, Shadow Who to your Intelligence. And then from there,

228
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:23,680
we can go into the abilities.

229
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:31,800
Uh, uh, uh, Patch Gyoda, you are a Force user. And so I based this off of Kotor. Uh, so Sentinel

230
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:38,320
Guardian Counselor. Um, if you spend one point, you're gonna get on Sentinel. Sentinel, I never

231
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:43,160
really liked how Kotor did it. They kind of tried to make it like a like like rogue or

232
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:50,160
specialist. I always liked watching Caleb play with his pumpkin lips. You know, I'm

233
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:57,420
waiting till it's my turn. Okay, it's almost your turn. So with Sentinel, you're gonna

234
00:09:57,420 --> 00:10:02,840
increase your max techno slime by 50%. Sentinel is basically taking advantage of your force

235
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:07,160
abilities. Uh huh. And like everything you get in there is gonna increase your when you

236
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:10,820
use the force which is one of your abilities is going to make that like

237
00:10:10,820 --> 00:10:15,200
really really powerful. Guardian is just going to make you a better fighter in

238
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:21,040
general so like a Yoda agility and Yoda warrior increase like Yoda agility I

239
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:24,360
think increases your I don't remember exactly I have to double check that but

240
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:29,080
Yoda warrior. I can increase my movement speed. Yes. I can deflect projectiles if my AC beats an

241
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:32,440
attack roll. Yes. Yeah all these buffs are pretty cool.

242
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:36,520
Yoda Warrior makes you like you can do an extra attack. So

243
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:40,520
that's fun and Yoda Hawks famous 900 is you do like a

244
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:44,520
Tony Hawk 900 and shoot out basically a gust attack in 5E

245
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:47,880
and then Counselor is sort of like game breaking divination

246
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:51,080
spell type **** So Yoda knows means you get to like actually

247
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:55,640
contact somebody we can discuss in game what that looks like to

248
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:59,320
make it work, but Yoda has been alive for 900 years. so you

249
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:02,200
should know somebody who can help you with something you have

250
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:06,120
much to learn. Young Jedi uh allows you to I don't remember

251
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:08,760
what the **** that allows you to do but I wrote it down and then

252
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:11,800
peace for Yoda. Peace for all is like allows you to literally

253
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:16,280
stop a fight in its tracks for 10 minutes. Um so again, like

254
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:18,760
all these things, anybody who's like plays five is like this

255
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:21,960
**** game breaking but that's why we're doing it. It's fun.

256
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:24,520
Uh Ray William Johnson, it's now your turn because I'm

257
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:28,440
making your **** awful faces. So, uh you have two points to

258
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:33,760
level up. You have are we demon? So that taps into your demon and your demons

259
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:38,520
abilities. What those can do and an are we computer which taps into your

260
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:45,200
computer side and then Bazinga. Bazinga is special. It's basically a hybrid of

261
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:49,240
your abilities. I don't want to quite give you too much information about that

262
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:55,160
unless you choose it but it involves a curse. Oh my god dude you're really gonna

263
00:11:55,160 --> 00:12:00,480
think that I'm not gonna pick that yeah I mean I kind of you could only you could

264
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:05,240
only pick bazinga level one at this point I have to wait to the next one

265
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:08,680
right and then you'll have like an extra point left over though for your next

266
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:13,680
level up if you do that and what that does it gives you all stats plus one

267
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:22,840
which is pretty crazy but then I'm gonna pull up a table of curses and give you

268
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:28,320
some sort of crazy curse and you're also gonna deal with some body transmographic

269
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:32,060
body or your body's gonna look different.

270
00:12:32,060 --> 00:12:37,280
Oh okay. It's gonna be the first phase of your body looking different. I choose

271
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:42,520
Bazinga. Alright I figured you you would. Okay so I made my choice too I don't

272
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:48,080
know I think I might have made mine. Okay so let's start with the order that you

273
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:52,480
guys announced. So Ray William Johnson you've chosen Bazinga so we're gonna

274
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:55,380
increase all your ability points by one and we're gonna do that right now. Let's

275
00:12:55,380 --> 00:13:00,640
fucking go. Yeah. Do I need to do that or can you do it? I got you. Such a good

276
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:07,160
friend. Such a good mom. How could it be in the mom? The best moms increase your ability points for you.

277
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:12,760
Please fucking don't don't do this to me man. You know? You're the dad.

278
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:18,840
You're the sexy dad dude. You're the dad and the mom. Look at that extra unbuttoned button.

279
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:23,020
That's not just a just to show us your dad. It's just hot in here. Yeah

280
00:13:23,020 --> 00:13:29,160
Dads are always hot dads are never never the right temperature. Yeah, it's true

281
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:34,480
And bazinga you get an armor class. Oh your armor class also goes up, right?

282
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:38,660
Great. Okay. I'm thinking I made the right choice. So so

283
00:13:38,660 --> 00:13:47,300
Yeah, so bazinga my description of refer it is you synchronize your being a demon in a computer a computer in the demon

284
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:51,780
What are you? Who are you? You're warring signs become more at peace, but at what cost?

285
00:13:51,780 --> 00:13:54,500
so

286
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:55,780
this

287
00:13:55,780 --> 00:13:59,080
We have a few curses in D&D that are

288
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:05,480
Some are funny. Some are like genuinely debilitating. It's like this is in real life

289
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:15,160
No curse in real life is funny. Fuck is funny. We cannot joke about curses glitter emoji star emoji

290
00:14:15,620 --> 00:14:18,300
Laugh emoji. They are not funny

291
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:24,660
The first thing I'm gonna describe for this though is how your body starts to change big juicy tits

292
00:14:24,660 --> 00:14:29,140
Back off dude. Worry about your own juicy tits, please

293
00:14:29,140 --> 00:14:35,380
So first thing is that please you please little eye candy for the other detectives

294
00:14:35,380 --> 00:14:38,660
You do not get big juicy tits

295
00:14:38,660 --> 00:14:44,500
Instead you get a a

296
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:50,500
a very interesting hairdo all of a sudden that sprouts in your head.

297
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:53,800
Doesn't sound like a curse. It's like my dream. That's the first

298
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:58,920
first part. It sort of looks like a like very high hairline,

299
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:06,280
very cropped haircut. brown hair kind of short. And it sort of

300
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:10,760
makes you look kind of dweeby, but it's sort of the first

301
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:13,520
Aspect you feel that sort of appear on top of your head

302
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:16,720
That's the first slavery because you kind of look like

303
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:23,860
Like a like a little boy almost with this haircut. I look like a little boy now

304
00:15:23,860 --> 00:15:33,000
What's gonna happen though what curse is it I'm gonna roll and pick one of these curses from that still eye candy for Patrick

305
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
I guess yes, no

306
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,880
No, it's not even better for him

307
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:41,040
No, shut up

308
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:48,120
So let me roll and I'm gonna pick from my list. Okay, here we go. Okay seven. Let's take a look at my list

309
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:53,520
Might not be so bad. That's the thing not the list. Oh

310
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:57,860
It's not gonna be bad. It's not gonna be bad. Seven is the Lord's number

311
00:15:57,860 --> 00:16:02,240
The Lord's number is 100 cuz that's how many angels he has

312
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:05,800
Is 100 angels

313
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:09,680
That noise wasn't can you dramatically react into the microphone?

314
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:18,720
That's a good like when you see like a very nice ghost

315
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:23,160
Yeah

316
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:25,720
That was a bust if I've ever heard one

317
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:28,040

00:17:58,220 --> 00:18:01,700
And it really sucks because you have an outdoor doctor's office.

00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:02,700
Ow.

339
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:04,540
Yeah, well it's cold.

340
00:18:04,540 --> 00:18:07,420
Well look we're dealing with a pandemic here so.

341
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:08,420
Ow.

342
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:13,020
Hold on, let me, so the doctor starts trying to put up a tent.

343
00:18:13,020 --> 00:18:14,020
Ow.

344
00:18:14,020 --> 00:18:15,460
Hurry up Eddie Bauer.

345
00:18:15,460 --> 00:18:17,220
Okay, how is that?

346
00:18:17,220 --> 00:18:19,900
Who I sound like he finishes putting up the tent now.

347
00:18:19,900 --> 00:18:24,000
Okay, let's take a look in here and he he takes out a fucking

348
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,900
what's the thing you look at when you're looking at fucking

349
00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:32,780
ears telescope. Yeah, telescope. He points it in your ear. He's

350
00:18:32,780 --> 00:18:35,940
like, Oh, interesting. And he sees in your in your in your

351
00:18:35,940 --> 00:18:47,400
brain. He sees a the logo for TBS just printed on your brain.

352
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:52,140
Yeah. Ah, interesting. And he he he showed he shows you the

353
00:18:52,140 --> 00:18:56,780
x-ray. It seems that you're very funny. Ray William Johnson. Why

354
00:18:56,780 --> 00:19:00,840
thank you. And but because of this, I recommend you stay out

355
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:05,920
of daylight. This is pretty good. I have DBS in my brain.

356
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:10,880
Yeah, that's right. I'm assuming so. I mean, I've never really seen anything like this before.

357
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:16,400
Your vitals are higher, you're running, your heart rate is perfect. You're the strongest I've

358
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:22,640
ever seen you. Your demon seems under control, but something else has happened to you. And I

359
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:27,680
don't know what that TBS is, but it's a very rare type of melanoma that seems to be growing on top

360
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:34,400
of your brain. I knew it. I knew it was cancer. Yeah. Well, it might be benign, but we'll have

361
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:36,400
have to do further checkups to find out.

362
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:39,400
Have you seen Bucket List with Queen Latifah?

363
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:41,400
She's not in that movie.

364
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:43,400
I don't think she's in that movie.

365
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:44,400
I thought that was her movie.

366
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:45,400
Isn't that with Morgan Freeman?

367
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:47,400
No, that's a different one.

368
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:49,400
That's any movie with Queen Latifah.

369
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:51,400
No, Bucket List is Morgan Freeman.

370
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:53,400
Morgan Freeman and Jack Nicholson.

371
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:54,400
Queen Latifah Cancer movie.

372
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:56,400
You're thinking of Last Holiday.

373
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:58,400
Have you seen Last Holiday?

374
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:00,400
[laughter]

375
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:03,400
No, I haven't. It's the year 2245.

376
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:04,600
How does that movie go?

377
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:05,600
Uh, never mind.

378
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:06,300
Continue, then.

379
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:07,600
Sure.

380
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:11,400
Well, I suppose based on how you were bringing that up, much

381
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:15,300
like Queen Latifah in Last Holiday, I would say you should

382
00:20:15,300 --> 00:20:19,500
be wary of of continuing down this path of increasing your

383
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:24,800
strength and and but increasing your level of curse, which

384
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:28,000
is what I'm going to call this as the doctor in this scene

385
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:31,300
that is happening while you guys are in the basement.

386
00:20:31,300 --> 00:20:32,300
You're calling me in.

387
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:36,600
It's uh, yeah, yeah, yeah. On their PSP. Yeah, of course. Yeah.

388
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:42,100
Yeah. Alright. Well, I have to go. Um I have to go look at uh

389
00:20:42,100 --> 00:20:48,500
uh pussy gotta go and he uh hangs up and and uh yeah, he

390
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:52,020
hangs up on you leaving you despondent with your new curse.

391
00:20:52,020 --> 00:20:55,380
So we'll figure out how that looks gun city's a dark

392
00:20:55,380 --> 00:20:58,180
Blade Runner type city. You won't always have to deal with

393
00:20:58,180 --> 00:21:04,780
that but there will be instances where the harsh fluorescent lights of the fake

394
00:21:04,780 --> 00:21:10,180
Sun above does cause you damage and we'll figure out how to do that maybe we want

395
00:21:10,180 --> 00:21:17,020
to get you an umbrella or something we'll see but next Cameron blowjob piss

396
00:21:17,020 --> 00:21:23,100
yeah you said next and then and then we'll go to mr. Yoda but Cameron what

397
00:21:23,100 --> 00:21:28,860
did you pick? What do you think? So out of the three paths I picked Shadow Who. Great.

398
00:21:28,860 --> 00:21:34,180
Shadow Who rocks. Yeah I think this is gonna be the most fun one. Yes and so

399
00:21:34,180 --> 00:21:39,140
Shadow Who. The day was unkind to the Grinch hunter who was mocked and made a

400
00:21:39,140 --> 00:21:45,020
fool of, but the night, oh yes the night, was so much kinder. Your brilliance and

401
00:21:45,020 --> 00:21:50,460
your curiosity led you to seek out, I wrote seek with an A, that's crazy, out

402
00:21:50,460 --> 00:21:57,060
out the forbidden Lorox magics, making you an unstoppable mystic warrior, feared by all.

403
00:21:57,060 --> 00:22:01,300
When a shadow who is on the case, everyone basically fucking shits themselves.

404
00:22:01,300 --> 00:22:05,380
You're in, you're out without a trace, except for the faint traces of mystic death.

405
00:22:05,380 --> 00:22:06,380
Add +1 to your intelligence.

406
00:22:06,380 --> 00:22:10,380
Okay, here, let me add my +1 to my intelligence really quick.

407
00:22:10,380 --> 00:22:14,340
Yes, and now you have three abilities here that you can choose from.

408
00:22:14,340 --> 00:22:16,620
I like all of them, but which one did you pick?

409
00:22:16,620 --> 00:22:19,020
I chose Master of Disguise.

410
00:22:19,020 --> 00:22:20,020
That's what I'm hearing.

411
00:22:20,020 --> 00:22:22,020
That's pretty much the only one.

412
00:22:22,020 --> 00:22:23,520
Yeah, Master of Disguise.

413
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:27,520
Your deep autism has allowed you to master mimicry of all creatures.

414
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:31,520
For four Techno Slime points, you can perfectly imitate

415
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:33,520
and disguise yourself as one person.

416
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:37,020
If anyone starts to pick up on it, they have to roll with disadvantage on an Insight check,

417
00:22:37,020 --> 00:22:39,520
and your Deception is rolled with advantage.

418
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:44,020
So, describe that process of mastering, of tapping into Lorex magic.

419
00:22:44,020 --> 00:22:47,020
Is this something you meddled in as a young Who boy?

420
00:22:47,020 --> 00:22:47,520
Yeah.

421
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:49,020
Or is this new for you?

422
00:22:49,020 --> 00:22:55,020
No, this is, um, I come, I kind of have just like an epiphany one day walking around, right?

423
00:22:55,020 --> 00:23:01,020
I'm walking around Gun City and I see one of those living statue performer guys and I'm

424
00:23:01,020 --> 00:23:04,300
like, "Oh my God," and I drop everything.

425
00:23:04,300 --> 00:23:10,460
I run back to my house and I sit down in a meditation pose, complete silence, and I think

426
00:23:10,460 --> 00:23:15,740
for about ten seconds and then when it's over I'm able to disguise myself as people.

427
00:23:15,740 --> 00:23:22,980
And so what I do, right, is I get up and I head out to Ray William Johnson's doctor and

428
00:23:22,980 --> 00:23:28,500
I disguise myself as Ray William Johnson and I go up to the doctor and I say, "Hey doc,

429
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:30,860
I need my stomach pumped.

430
00:23:30,860 --> 00:23:37,460
I think I guzzled too much cum last night and accidentally swallowed my favorite toy, but

431
00:23:37,460 --> 00:23:41,460
could you make an appointment for tomorrow for that to happen and please come to my house

432
00:23:41,460 --> 00:23:43,820
and do that to me tomorrow morning?

433
00:23:43,820 --> 00:23:46,140
"Hey, thanks doc. See you later."

434
00:23:46,140 --> 00:23:46,980
And I go back to my house.

435
00:23:46,980 --> 00:23:49,740
- And the best part of that was it was all a dream.

436
00:23:49,740 --> 00:23:52,100
(laughing)

437
00:23:52,100 --> 00:23:52,940
- No, that happened.

438
00:23:52,940 --> 00:23:55,580
- And the whole thing was a dream, and that's the--

439
00:23:55,580 --> 00:23:56,820
- That's the best part of it.

440
00:23:56,820 --> 00:23:57,660
- You know what?

441
00:23:57,660 --> 00:24:01,820
Since this doctor exists in a fake liminal space,

442
00:24:01,820 --> 00:24:04,460
I want you guys to roll contesting D20s

443
00:24:04,460 --> 00:24:05,620
to see if it happens or not.

444
00:24:05,620 --> 00:24:06,940
- I'm gonna win. - This is gonna happen.

445
00:24:06,940 --> 00:24:08,580
- I will win. - This has to happen.

446
00:24:08,580 --> 00:24:10,500
- I will win.

447
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:11,460
- I got a 15.

448
00:24:11,460 --> 00:24:13,020
- You got a one. - Oh no, I got a one.

449
00:24:13,020 --> 00:24:13,860
God damn it.

450
00:24:13,860 --> 00:24:15,060
Yes.

451
00:24:15,060 --> 00:24:18,340
All right, roll, roll Caleb.

452
00:24:18,340 --> 00:24:19,820
He did, he got a 15.

453
00:24:19,820 --> 00:24:20,660
Oh, you did?

454
00:24:20,660 --> 00:24:21,820
Oh, damn, okay.

455
00:24:21,820 --> 00:24:23,260
So yeah, so here's what I actually have.

456
00:24:23,260 --> 00:24:26,700
You go to the doctor and you do say this,

457
00:24:26,700 --> 00:24:30,420
but the doctor writes down instead,

458
00:24:30,420 --> 00:24:33,700
Dominican Cameron, Caleb's wife, to get her stomach pumped.

459
00:24:33,700 --> 00:24:35,220
So he's still gonna go there.

460
00:24:35,220 --> 00:24:38,220
Pump my wife's stomach, dude, without me there?

461
00:24:38,220 --> 00:24:39,060
That's disrespectful.

462
00:24:39,060 --> 00:24:39,880
Yeah, that's fucked up.

463
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:41,700
That's not what I was trying to do at all.

464
00:24:41,700 --> 00:24:42,540
Yeah, no.

465
00:24:42,540 --> 00:24:44,940
I wish that I was just getting my stomach pumped.

466
00:24:44,940 --> 00:24:46,940
- Okay, you heard him Pat, just do it, do it.

467
00:24:46,940 --> 00:24:47,780
- Okay, so.

468
00:24:47,780 --> 00:24:51,260
- It's like a cool Rod Stewart thing, you know.

469
00:24:51,260 --> 00:24:53,460
- Is that what's cool about Rod Stewart?

470
00:24:53,460 --> 00:24:55,340
- Yeah, you got his stomach.

471
00:24:55,340 --> 00:24:56,900
I don't know anything else about him.

472
00:24:56,900 --> 00:24:58,800
I thought he was just famous for that.

473
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:01,300
- Okay, yeah, sure.

474
00:25:01,300 --> 00:25:03,460
We're gonna have it, he goes to you then.

475
00:25:03,460 --> 00:25:04,460
Let's do that.

476
00:25:04,460 --> 00:25:06,100
We'll resolve that when that comes.

477
00:25:06,100 --> 00:25:07,460
I'll have to make a note.

478
00:25:07,460 --> 00:25:09,060
- It happens the next end game day.

479
00:25:09,060 --> 00:25:11,300
- Which is not where I ever saw my life going,

480
00:25:11,300 --> 00:25:12,300
but I'll have to take a note about that.

481
00:25:12,300 --> 00:25:13,580
It happens two sessions from now.

482
00:25:13,580 --> 00:25:14,580
Yeah, yeah.

483
00:25:14,580 --> 00:25:16,580
Set an alarm on your phone.

484
00:25:16,580 --> 00:25:18,580
Dr. Pumps.

485
00:25:18,580 --> 00:25:21,580
Dr. Cum Pumper.

486
00:25:21,580 --> 00:25:22,580
That's his name.

487
00:25:22,580 --> 00:25:23,580
That's his name.

488
00:25:23,580 --> 00:25:26,580
Dr. Cum Pumper.

489
00:25:26,580 --> 00:25:32,180
Dr. Cum Pumper just finished looking at a pussy and now he has to extract cum in a toy

490
00:25:32,180 --> 00:25:33,180
from my stomach.

491
00:25:33,180 --> 00:25:35,940
Actually, no, he has to leave the cum.

492
00:25:35,940 --> 00:25:36,940
I want the cum in there.

493
00:25:36,940 --> 00:25:37,940
Yeah, yeah.

494
00:25:37,940 --> 00:25:40,940
He has to just take the toy.

495
00:25:40,940 --> 00:25:45,780
get my toy out. Yeah, the cum was not the problem. And if you touch a single drop of cum. If

496
00:25:45,780 --> 00:25:50,940
you disturb the position of any of the cum. You just said this to him. It's like operation.

497
00:25:50,940 --> 00:25:56,660
He's not like batting an eye. He's like, yeah, of course. Like that's. Of course, the toy

498
00:25:56,660 --> 00:26:02,420
is what's most important here. I will never, I would never compromise the cum in your tummy.

499
00:26:02,420 --> 00:26:09,420
Um, okay, perfect. So you have master of disguise. That's going to be pretty cool. Um, I'm excited

500
00:26:09,420 --> 00:26:17,740
to see that. Now, Patrick Iota, much like the protagonist of KOTOR 1, you are now choosing

501
00:26:17,740 --> 00:26:27,380
between three paths. So, between counselor, guardian, or sentinel.

502
00:26:27,380 --> 00:26:29,300
I'm gonna be the counselor.

503
00:26:29,300 --> 00:26:34,100
Hell yes. Okay, let me find... what the fuck did I write for this?

504
00:26:34,100 --> 00:26:35,660
You should fuck Bastila.

505
00:26:35,660 --> 00:26:37,660
Dude, she's so fine.

506
00:26:37,660 --> 00:26:39,660
the

507
00:26:39,660 --> 00:26:41,660
the

508
00:26:41,660 --> 00:26:42,900
(laughs)

509
00:26:42,900 --> 00:26:45,620
- Dracula, you gotta fuck Dracula.

510
00:26:45,620 --> 00:26:46,460
- I might.

511
00:26:46,460 --> 00:26:48,940
Don't worry, don't worry, I might.

512
00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:51,500
- The Jedi counselors are the ones who understand

513
00:26:51,500 --> 00:26:53,580
that peace can be the answer.

514
00:26:53,580 --> 00:26:55,340
They build connections, use diplomacy,

515
00:26:55,340 --> 00:26:56,980
and work with the flow of the force

516
00:26:56,980 --> 00:26:59,740
to bring about peace and harmony.

517
00:26:59,740 --> 00:27:01,500
Yodas are often counselors,

518
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:03,180
using their superior wisdom and age

519
00:27:03,180 --> 00:27:05,780
to build a foundation for peaceful force techniques.

520
00:27:05,780 --> 00:27:09,320
If I say peace one more time, add plus one to your wisdom.

521
00:27:11,140 --> 00:27:12,980
So that's pretty neat.

522
00:27:12,980 --> 00:27:15,260
And now you have three abilities to choose from.

523
00:27:15,260 --> 00:27:16,660
Wait, do I add it to the 20?

524
00:27:16,660 --> 00:27:18,540
Yes.

525
00:27:18,540 --> 00:27:19,060
Oh yeah.

526
00:27:19,060 --> 00:27:19,420
Oh yeah.

527
00:27:19,420 --> 00:27:23,740
Also in this, which, uh, people in five who are familiar with five, do I type

528
00:27:23,740 --> 00:27:26,060
plus one or do I just make it a 21?

529
00:27:26,060 --> 00:27:27,400
Just make it a 21.

530
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:27,740
Okay.

531
00:27:27,740 --> 00:27:33,140
Um, is that I, I allow them to go over 20, um, because I don't care.

532
00:27:33,140 --> 00:27:34,860
Uh, I think that rule is stupid.

533
00:27:35,140 --> 00:27:36,340
badass

534
00:27:36,340 --> 00:27:38,020
so

535
00:27:38,020 --> 00:27:41,880
Jedi counselor you have three abilities you can choose from right now

536
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:46,920
What are you thinking? I think I don't even want to hear what they do

537
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:50,820
You just want to guess reading what they do

538
00:27:50,820 --> 00:27:56,620
Okay, I just haven't been able to decide so yeah for listeners Yoda

539
00:27:56,620 --> 00:28:02,060
He has Yoda nose, which is that he can basically contact. It's sort of like there's um

540
00:28:02,060 --> 00:28:06,740
I forgot what the there's a background in D&D that allows you to like make a

541
00:28:06,740 --> 00:28:09,780
contact and this is sort of like replicating that except like we're

542
00:28:09,780 --> 00:28:13,220
bypassing a lot of bullshit with that and just letting him contact somebody

543
00:28:13,220 --> 00:28:17,660
when he's in a tough situation. He and I will discuss in real time

544
00:28:17,660 --> 00:28:21,900
like sort of what that looks like. Once he uses it you can't use it again until a

545
00:28:21,900 --> 00:28:26,580
long rest so whenever he sleeps again. You have much to learn young Jedi which

546
00:28:26,580 --> 00:28:33,360
is a courtesy of Ron Donald. Basically, you can forge a telepathic link among up to

547
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:36,780
eight willing creatures of your choice within range. So this is like, I forgot

548
00:28:36,780 --> 00:28:39,820
what fucking spell this is like, but it doesn't matter. So the point is that

549
00:28:39,820 --> 00:28:43,380
basically he can like communicate telepathically with his friends, which is

550
00:28:43,380 --> 00:28:51,100
obviously a huge, a huge boon. And, but it's not, you're not able to

551
00:28:51,100 --> 00:28:55,260
communicate over different planes of existence, which is true for the

552
00:28:55,260 --> 00:28:58,660
whatever the spell is in 5e, but is like the matrix 2 in this one.

553
00:28:58,660 --> 00:29:02,060
So he wouldn't be able to communicate with people through the matrix 2

554
00:29:02,060 --> 00:29:03,060
should he go in there.

555
00:29:03,060 --> 00:29:08,260
And all creatures who are linked with him have advantage on saving

556
00:29:08,260 --> 00:29:09,060
throws while linked.

557
00:29:09,060 --> 00:29:12,960
So it's a really helpful spell and they have a so I can link to a

558
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:16,460
character while using it and then like as long as they're willing,

559
00:29:16,460 --> 00:29:20,160
okay, and it's just so that you can talk with them basically.

560
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:21,460
So it's good for your allies.

561
00:29:21,460 --> 00:29:23,560
If you want to talk if you're in a tense situation and you don't

562
00:29:23,560 --> 00:29:28,200
want to alarm somebody about your side plannings.

563
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:30,920
So it's sort of like in-game metagaming, basically.

564
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:31,960
- Okay.

565
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:34,920
- And then Peace for Yoda, Peace for All.

566
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:38,860
Patrick Yoda basically creates a realm of mental stability,

567
00:29:38,860 --> 00:29:41,880
instantly calming any conflict he's in for 10 minutes.

568
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:43,160
This means a fight can be stopped

569
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:44,960
and turned into a conversation.

570
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:47,040
So like in games when people are like,

571
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:49,200
"Oh, I want to like persuade them to stop fighting."

572
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:50,560
Most of the time when you're in the middle of a fight,

573
00:29:50,560 --> 00:29:52,360
I'm like, "I'm not going to let you do it."

574
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:54,920
because it's like someone shooting at you.

575
00:29:54,920 --> 00:29:58,120
But in this case, Patrick Yoda can basically just like

576
00:29:58,120 --> 00:30:01,400
use his Yoda abilities to calm everyone down for 10 minutes.

577
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:02,640
That doesn't mean everyone's gonna be friends,

578
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:04,120
but they'll basically stop fighting

579
00:30:04,120 --> 00:30:05,080
and he could figure out,

580
00:30:05,080 --> 00:30:06,920
sort of strategize from there what to do

581
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:08,160
as long as he doesn't like instigate

582
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:09,700
another fight, obviously.

583
00:30:09,700 --> 00:30:12,560
So three really cool abilities.

584
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:13,640
Which do you want?

585
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:18,920
- I'm gonna go, I'm gonna do peace for Yoda.

586
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:21,280
- Awesome, yeah.

587
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:22,600
So what happens?

588
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:27,280
What led Patrick Yoda into this counselor mindset?

589
00:30:27,280 --> 00:30:28,480
Why did he choose this?

590
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:31,880
- Just kind of decided.

591
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:35,240
(all laughing)

592
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:38,960
I look over Cameron, so we're still, are we still in,

593
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:40,560
no, we're not in Sullivan's car.

594
00:30:40,560 --> 00:30:43,440
- You're in mommy's good legs, weird basement.

595
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:44,280
- Secret basement.

596
00:30:44,280 --> 00:30:48,120
- So I just, I turn to Blotas and I say,

597
00:30:48,120 --> 00:30:50,540
"Hey, I'm gonna be peaceful now."

598
00:30:50,540 --> 00:30:55,140
I punch him in the face.

599
00:30:55,140 --> 00:30:57,780
And I say, I say, I'm going to be peaceful.

600
00:30:57,780 --> 00:31:01,100
What do I roll?

601
00:31:01,100 --> 00:31:05,060
Yeah, do you want to if you want the punch to face to be real?

602
00:31:05,060 --> 00:31:07,100
We can know it was I did it.

603
00:31:07,100 --> 00:31:08,580
I did it as a joke.

604
00:31:08,580 --> 00:31:09,580
Yeah.

605
00:31:09,580 --> 00:31:10,580
So it was just because it was a joke.

606
00:31:10,580 --> 00:31:11,900
You didn't take any damage.

607
00:31:11,900 --> 00:31:15,020
Um, the prank, like just like in real life.

608
00:31:15,020 --> 00:31:16,020
Yeah.

609
00:31:16,020 --> 00:31:17,020
Uh, yeah.

610
00:31:17,020 --> 00:31:18,020
Okay.

611
00:31:18,020 --> 00:31:19,020
So you guys are all leveled up.

612
00:31:19,020 --> 00:31:20,420
So you're feeling stronger.

613
00:31:20,420 --> 00:31:25,980
feeling more... I'm me dude I'm fucking allergic to the Sun and and bald. You got

614
00:31:25,980 --> 00:31:34,820
all your stats boosted dude. You're strong as fuck. I guess. Yeah and and you have one

615
00:31:34,820 --> 00:31:40,640
ability point left over so you can spend more next time but yeah so now what you

616
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:44,220
can do is so now here's where you guys are at you're in the basement she

617
00:31:44,220 --> 00:31:51,120
basically told you like I have I talked with with Sullivan the frog so if you

618
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:54,900
guys want to do the heist you can but that being said there's a lot you guys

619
00:31:54,900 --> 00:32:02,300
can do you know you guys learned a lot of information since then about the you

620
00:32:02,300 --> 00:32:04,660
know about what's going on the techno slime what's going on a bunch of other

621
00:32:04,660 --> 00:32:08,500
things so there's a lot places you can go from here but if you want to do that

622
00:32:08,500 --> 00:32:13,100
want to do a heist you can wait so why do we need why we need money right why do

623
00:32:13,100 --> 00:32:16,060
we need money again? Yeah, so here's here's what's up. You

624
00:32:16,060 --> 00:32:22,700
need you need money to basically to uh uh either a repair the um

625
00:32:22,700 --> 00:32:27,260
techno slime uh uh not techno slime. **** my **** Uh the

626
00:32:27,260 --> 00:32:32,540
matrix two um sort of portals to get in there which mommy would

627
00:32:32,540 --> 00:32:36,220
spend on but she wants to first make sure that Sean is

628
00:32:36,220 --> 00:32:38,860
definitely in there because otherwise it's basically just

629
00:32:38,860 --> 00:32:42,860
like wasting time repairing it. Mm hmm. Um obviously you have

630
00:32:42,860 --> 00:32:46,660
other options. So one of her things is like, okay, I like can help you guys break

631
00:32:46,660 --> 00:32:53,460
into the records office so that you could find out if Sean is still in there. Or

632
00:32:53,460 --> 00:32:59,500
you know, you can ask around, you can, there's a bunch of things you can do. But

633
00:32:59,500 --> 00:33:02,660
this is like the first time where I'm kind of like, figure out what you want to

634
00:33:02,660 --> 00:33:07,820
do. So I can lay out the details once more, some more details too. So when you

635
00:33:07,820 --> 00:33:11,300
went to the lab, it was a tech, it looked like some sort of like makeshift tech,

636
00:33:11,300 --> 00:33:13,300
There's slime in lab

637
00:33:13,300 --> 00:33:21,280
You found a blueprint with dr. Tool lateralis his name on it. You found raw techno slime. You found those weird like sort of a red-eye

638
00:33:21,280 --> 00:33:26,860
fucking a cowboy bebop techno slime drugs you

639
00:33:26,860 --> 00:33:29,840
You

640
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:37,300
found the V sort of warriors that are like kind of apparently a thing in gun city right now that are like

641
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:42,160
Kind of kind of scary because the idea of being able to like replicate people who can just

642
00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:49,980
Basically being able to generate people with code who can hurt people in real life is a bad prospect for people

643
00:33:49,980 --> 00:33:56,440
but also mommy good legs has provided you obviously with like a thing that you could do and a path forward but

644
00:33:56,440 --> 00:34:01,820
that requires like more illicit break-ins, so

645
00:34:01,820 --> 00:34:04,280
I

646
00:34:04,280 --> 00:34:06,280
Think I have an idea

647
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:12,280
the

648
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:14,760
you want to discuss with us first?

649
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:16,940
yeah what's going on?

650
00:34:16,940 --> 00:34:19,720
uh... what are you doing with your phone you know you're not supposed to go on

651
00:34:19,720 --> 00:34:22,760
your phone without asking us first

652
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:26,480
you need a... i can't actually allowed to go on my it's my phone

653
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:28,920
it's my property i pay T-Mobile every month

654
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:30,200
no you have a jitterbug phone

655
00:34:30,200 --> 00:34:32,600
me and Patrick don't

656
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:36,560
you have a jitterbug phone and me and Patrick pay for it so i mean you kinda have to go

657
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:40,560
to us... oh i'm sorry i'm just i'm calling nine one one which is the third button

658
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:48,680
besides you and Patrick. Wink wink. Well I'm gonna have to believe him. Yeah why not?

659
00:34:48,680 --> 00:34:54,720
Okay yeah so you call Papi Chuko. I don't know why I'm hiding this from them.

660
00:34:54,720 --> 00:35:02,960
Okay so I'm calling Papi Chuko now. Okay cool. Yeah the ring back tone is the

661
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:10,520
Godfather theme and he he picks up he says um and I feel like I messed up his

662
00:35:10,520 --> 00:35:13,720
voice last time so I'm trying to make sure I remember how I wanted him to

663
00:35:13,720 --> 00:35:23,960
sound he's a cricket I believe he was Chinese if I'm very mainland Chinese

664
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:25,960
Because if you keep saying it

665
00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:31,720
Okay

666
00:35:31,720 --> 00:35:47,220
Wait, wait William Johnson. Hmm. Well, it's good that you called me. What's what's going on my friend? What's up, man?

667
00:35:47,220 --> 00:35:50,840
Okay, yeah going

668
00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:57,420
You just are you just checking in or I mean, you know, I try to do a little small talk up top

669
00:35:57,420 --> 00:36:08,400
I'm doing okay. I'm just enjoying my can I but can I sell you some drugs?

670
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:20,400
What do you mean explain to me all right, I have this stuff right it's super high potency

671
00:36:20,680 --> 00:36:22,680
Excuse me, I'm on the phone.

672
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:26,180
Well, while he's on the phone, I turn to Patrick Yoda and I'm like,

673
00:36:26,180 --> 00:36:29,680
"Look at this guy's hustle, dude. He's trying to sell drugs to 911."

674
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:33,680
[laughter]

675
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:38,680
And I just give, like, a sly thumbs-up to them, like, I'm really working on it.

676
00:36:38,680 --> 00:36:40,680
[laughter]

677
00:36:40,680 --> 00:36:46,680
So I have these two beakers of highly potent techno-slime.

678
00:36:46,680 --> 00:36:49,680
Where did you find those?

679
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:53,120
uh... room

680
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:54,920
payrolls role deception

681
00:36:54,920 --> 00:36:57,920
uh... right i mean

682
00:36:57,920 --> 00:37:01,000
uh... but i guess i think i have to help us

683
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:04,840
that's not just a lie okay fine and i wrote a little bit

684
00:37:04,840 --> 00:37:08,840
not yet i'm gonna let the big room

685
00:37:08,840 --> 00:37:09,900
k you're

686
00:37:09,900 --> 00:37:15,740
pushing it so we can't always a factory it was a few men and sort of weird

687
00:37:15,740 --> 00:37:21,260
I don't really remember. That was over three weeks ago. It was some sort of factory.

688
00:37:21,260 --> 00:37:23,420
But in game, of course, it was...

689
00:37:23,420 --> 00:37:24,420
It was minutes ago.

690
00:37:24,420 --> 00:37:27,020
Yeah, right? Something like that.

691
00:37:27,020 --> 00:37:29,860
So, do you tell him that it's a factory?

692
00:37:29,860 --> 00:37:33,340
Yeah, yeah. It was in a factory.

693
00:37:33,340 --> 00:37:38,060
Sorry, wait. I'm actually rethinking this. Bye.

694
00:37:38,060 --> 00:37:42,660
Okay. Okay, cool. Yeah, so you hang up on him.

695
00:37:42,660 --> 00:37:45,660
I realize that maybe he's not the guy to be giving that information to.

696
00:37:45,660 --> 00:37:47,660
Yeah, what do you look at?

697
00:37:47,660 --> 00:37:51,660
Nah, well, you know what? That was my attempt.

698
00:37:51,660 --> 00:37:53,660
How about you guys give it a shot?

699
00:37:53,660 --> 00:37:55,660
Okay, I'm writing that down.

700
00:37:55,660 --> 00:37:57,660
Your action happened.

701
00:37:57,660 --> 00:38:00,660
Oh my god, I fucked the whole thing up.

702
00:38:00,660 --> 00:38:02,660
Why? Can you just ask us first?

703
00:38:02,660 --> 00:38:04,660
I have an idea.

704
00:38:04,660 --> 00:38:07,660
This is why we give you the jitterbug, okay?

705
00:38:07,660 --> 00:38:09,660
This is why you're not allowed to call people.

706
00:38:09,660 --> 00:38:11,660
That's why you can only speed dial people.

707
00:38:11,660 --> 00:38:19,100
Now I have a great idea. Now, can I borrow your phone, Blotas? I lost mine in the river

708
00:38:19,100 --> 00:38:20,580
when I was swimming.

709
00:38:20,580 --> 00:38:23,820
When were you swimming?

710
00:38:23,820 --> 00:38:24,820
I'm not Blotas.

711
00:38:24,820 --> 00:38:25,820
I'm sorry.

712
00:38:25,820 --> 00:38:30,700
When were you swimming? Why did you go swimming?

713
00:38:30,700 --> 00:38:36,300
I, well, as you know, the shower in my home is broken, so I decided...

714
00:38:36,300 --> 00:38:37,300
I did not know that.

715
00:38:37,300 --> 00:38:41,620
I did not know you had a home. I thought you just slept on your hoverboard.

716
00:38:41,620 --> 00:38:54,060
the

717
00:38:54,060 --> 00:38:56,600
fifth

718
00:38:56,600 --> 00:38:58,600
I'll admit that I have a plan.

719
00:38:58,600 --> 00:39:02,100
You went all the way to Planet Fitness to take a shower?

720
00:39:02,100 --> 00:39:06,600
Yeah, I had to go.

721
00:39:06,600 --> 00:39:08,600
Look, I have the membership.

722
00:39:08,600 --> 00:39:11,600
Are you okay, Yona?

723
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:14,600
You okay? You have to stop smoking.

724
00:39:14,600 --> 00:39:17,600
I've smoked so much K2.

725
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:23,600
I don't think I should give him my phone.

726
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:25,600
I think, hold on.

727
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:31,040
Once I get past the shower story, I'll tell you what I'm gonna do.

728
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:41,800
So, I have the membership to Planet Fitness so that I can use my, I don't have to, I can live

729
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:44,680
remotely like I do.

730
00:39:44,680 --> 00:39:51,280
Anyway, can I see your phone? I'm gonna call Papi Chico back and tell him to disregard everything that he just said.

731
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:58,760
I don't I'm gonna say no on that one pal. Why I think we should just leave him alone

732
00:39:58,760 --> 00:40:01,000
No

733
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:04,240
Why don't you go buy a new phone and call him then if you want to so bad?

734
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:07,980
Well, it's in the river. Why do you go use the phone and I just said I knew one

735
00:40:07,980 --> 00:40:10,400
I bet you want to ask him out. Yeah

736
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:15,340
I bet you want to ask him on a date. Yeah, you know what? I ask him on a date

737
00:40:15,340 --> 00:40:18,120
You just want to ask him if you can come over and do things to him

738
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:22,720
No without even the date par for yeah, you want to take a shower with Bobby Juco?

739
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:25,520
No, I don't I just wanna I just want to talk

740
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:30,400
Well, anyway I was swimming in the river because

741
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:36,480
Shower

742
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:38,960
So you're regaling them with?

743
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:43,520
Absolutely fucking insane shower river story and

744
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:51,080
You guys hear some like flap flap flap flap like a froggy foot foot feets sort of slapping on the stairs

745
00:40:51,080 --> 00:40:53,080
I turn around and shoot him

746
00:40:53,080 --> 00:41:07,240
Solve here could be anything solving the frog is sort of flapping down the stairs and he's like, sorry fellas

747
00:41:07,240 --> 00:41:09,240
It's getting hot in the car

748
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:15,000
Do you mind just being in the car at least I want to park illegally

749
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:17,780
Okay, listen Sullivan. We came up with a plan

750
00:41:17,780 --> 00:41:24,900
Basically, what we're gonna do is we're gonna sell Patrick Yoda and keep her into human traffickers for a hundred million dollars

751
00:41:24,900 --> 00:41:26,900
No, and then we're gonna steal him

752
00:41:26,900 --> 00:41:29,840
Finish making that no, so if you could

753
00:41:29,840 --> 00:41:37,520
Trafficking ring or Yoda traveling ring, I guess would be more of an apt turn of phrase. But yeah, that's our plan

754
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:39,220
- So, uh, take us there. - That was not the plan.

755
00:41:39,220 --> 00:41:42,720
- Right now. No. - I guess I could start looking into...

756
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:44,720
- Don't look into it! - (laughs)

757
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:49,220
- Don't look into it at all! - Okay, he doesn't seem to agree on...

758
00:41:49,220 --> 00:41:51,720
- I'm just a... Look, I just wanted to help you guys. - He's joking around.

759
00:41:51,720 --> 00:41:54,220
- I'm not joking around. - Hey, hey, Patrick Yoda, come here.

760
00:41:54,220 --> 00:41:57,220
- He's the one joking. - Patrick Yoda, come here.

761
00:41:57,220 --> 00:41:59,220
- What's up? - Come here real quick.

762
00:41:59,220 --> 00:42:04,220
Do you see... Is there a weird bug in the bottom of this giant butterfly net?

763
00:42:04,220 --> 00:42:06,220
- (laughs) - No, there isn't.

764
00:42:06,220 --> 00:42:11,920
The I don't know I think there is I think you need to get closer. There's not one but look are you sure?

765
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:13,920
Oh, I see it. It's oh my god

766
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:17,040
That there is it. Oh, it's oh, it's it's beatboxing

767
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:22,000
You won't miss it I can see right through it

768
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:29,040
No, but it's a there's a very small. It's an invisible bug unless you're looking in the net or something

769
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:32,440
There's no such thing as an invisible bug. It's the future. There's such a

770
00:42:33,480 --> 00:42:36,640
This net the inside of the net smells very cool

771
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:44,520
Nope how does smell this net? How does it how does it smell like a thousand dollars? It's indescribable

772
00:42:44,520 --> 00:42:47,000
I'm not going in there. Which one?

773
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:51,320
Not going in there. Is it a thousand dollars or it describes it?

774
00:42:51,320 --> 00:42:56,420
I could not describe it, but I guess you kind of nailed hit the nail on the head with a thousand

775
00:42:56,420 --> 00:43:02,480
Yeah, I guess I would have never been able to describe that. Okay, that doesn't sound so pleasant like that's a sounds

776
00:43:02,760 --> 00:43:05,800
Well, it's not really for you. It's more for Patrick Yoda.

777
00:43:05,800 --> 00:43:08,800
Well, I hate that smell! I hate that smell!

778
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:12,560
While everyone's distracted, I grab Patrick Yoda and I put him in a headlock.

779
00:43:12,560 --> 00:43:16,560
Okay, do a contested strength check for both of you.

780
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:19,560
Both of you guys roll strength checks.

781
00:43:19,560 --> 00:43:22,560
Me and Cameron?

782
00:43:22,560 --> 00:43:23,560
I got a 19.

783
00:43:23,560 --> 00:43:26,560
Goddamn.

784
00:43:26,560 --> 00:43:28,560
I got a 1.

785
00:43:28,560 --> 00:43:32,560
Goddamn, you get him in the headlock so easily.

786
00:43:32,560 --> 00:43:34,560
Okay, this is not fair!

787
00:43:34,560 --> 00:43:36,560
Put the net over him.

788
00:43:36,560 --> 00:43:37,560
No!

789
00:43:37,560 --> 00:43:38,560
Here, get in the net.

790
00:43:38,560 --> 00:43:40,560
I'm not gonna be sold into human trafficking.

791
00:43:40,560 --> 00:43:42,560
We're gonna get you right back, right after.

792
00:43:42,560 --> 00:43:44,560
Yeah, don't worry about it.

793
00:43:44,560 --> 00:43:46,560
Like a week after.

794
00:43:46,560 --> 00:43:48,560
This sucks, I hate this.

795
00:43:48,560 --> 00:43:50,560
You're already in the net, there's nothing I can do anymore.

796
00:43:50,560 --> 00:43:52,560
I don't know how to get you out.

797
00:43:52,560 --> 00:43:54,560
It's out of our hands now.

798
00:43:54,560 --> 00:43:57,560
Okay, do you want to try to resist being in the net?

799
00:43:57,560 --> 00:43:58,560
Yes.

800
00:43:58,560 --> 00:44:03,600
Okay, roll a I guess roll I'm trying to think I guess roll

801
00:44:03,600 --> 00:44:06,760
strength again because

802
00:44:06,760 --> 00:44:09,360
the history

803
00:44:09,360 --> 00:44:16,040
You know something about nets, yeah

804
00:44:16,040 --> 00:44:24,880
You're trying to keep him in the net then it's contested again. Yeah, I'm definitely trying to keep him in the net. Okay. Oh

805
00:44:26,280 --> 00:44:34,160
Okay, give your baby you got 17 17 fuck me. All right. Um, don't worry. I got this don't trip

806
00:44:34,160 --> 00:44:38,000
I'm not tripping. Don't trip. Oh my god

807
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:46,060
Even okay. Wait, let's see. Then at this point. We have to just look at your Caleb as the higher bonus on the roll at least

808
00:44:46,060 --> 00:44:47,400
Oh

809
00:44:47,400 --> 00:44:50,600
Yeah, he does. So he does win. That is kind of how yes. No

810
00:44:51,120 --> 00:44:57,260
So you, you, you, Patrick you and you, you give your best, you guys are like locking hands

811
00:44:57,260 --> 00:44:58,260
like the fuck.

812
00:44:58,260 --> 00:45:00,060
Real life Patrick is so upset.

813
00:45:00,060 --> 00:45:03,260
I can see he looks so sad.

814
00:45:03,260 --> 00:45:05,860
I don't want to be assaulted to human trafficking.

815
00:45:05,860 --> 00:45:06,860
You're gonna be, it's happening.

816
00:45:06,860 --> 00:45:10,900
Hey well I didn't want my character to almost die last session dude, this is how D&D works

817
00:45:10,900 --> 00:45:11,900
alright?

818
00:45:11,900 --> 00:45:12,900
That wasn't our fault, that was your fault.

819
00:45:12,900 --> 00:45:13,900
Maybe you should leave Everett Street.

820
00:45:13,900 --> 00:45:16,500
It was absolutely, it was your fault for running away instead of standing in front of me.

821
00:45:16,500 --> 00:45:18,780
So do you guys, do you guys carry him like to the car?

822
00:45:18,780 --> 00:45:21,740
Yeah, we're carrying them across the street to the human traffic outlet.

823
00:45:21,740 --> 00:45:22,740
[laughter]

824
00:45:22,740 --> 00:45:24,740
You guys carry them too.

825
00:45:24,740 --> 00:45:26,740
Yeah, which the humans are us.

826
00:45:26,740 --> 00:45:27,740
[laughter]

827
00:45:27,740 --> 00:45:29,740
To Sullivan's car, at least.

828
00:45:29,740 --> 00:45:32,740
You guys dump him in there, in the net.

829
00:45:32,740 --> 00:45:34,740
And Sullivan's like,

830
00:45:34,740 --> 00:45:36,740
"I don't know if I can actually..."

831
00:45:36,740 --> 00:45:38,740
"Shut up and drive, frog!"

832
00:45:38,740 --> 00:45:39,740
[laughter]

833
00:45:39,740 --> 00:45:43,740
"I don't think I feel comfortable trafficking this Yoda."

834
00:45:43,740 --> 00:45:47,740
"I use my prayer."

835
00:45:47,740 --> 00:45:49,740
Use my prayer to

836
00:45:49,740 --> 00:45:52,740
Pray that the car crashes

837
00:45:52,740 --> 00:46:04,700
So so at this point

838
00:46:04,700 --> 00:46:10,300
Solvent solvent sort of says he goes. Okay. Well while we're in here, I do have some stuff for you guys

839
00:46:10,300 --> 00:46:16,220
Look, I didn't have a lot of time to look over the place that mommy

840
00:46:16,740 --> 00:46:22,580
Good make sent me to but I did manage to drop some diagrams in case you're interested in

841
00:46:22,580 --> 00:46:26,960
Break it in and figuring out where Sean is it's all of in

842
00:46:26,960 --> 00:46:29,540
Buddy, are you blind?

843
00:46:29,540 --> 00:46:34,740
About Sean and I just want to get out of the we are we put them in a net

844
00:46:34,740 --> 00:46:40,940
Yeah, it'll be all mad if we take him out now we gotta go we gotta go

845
00:46:41,820 --> 00:46:44,600
It'll just be like we like stuff will be awkward if we

846
00:46:44,600 --> 00:46:51,300
If we go through with the plan, you don't you don't know how you'll feel about something until it happens

847
00:46:51,300 --> 00:46:56,660
From Pete Holmes

848
00:46:56,660 --> 00:47:03,340
Just try it it's not gonna be that bad we'll get you right out max max a year

849
00:47:03,340 --> 00:47:10,540
You guys are hell-bent on this plan I could take you to my cousin

850
00:47:10,540 --> 00:47:17,020
who might know a way to sort of... I don't really know what the goal is to traffic...

851
00:47:17,020 --> 00:47:19,460
We sell... what do you mean? We want money.

852
00:47:19,460 --> 00:47:21,660
Okay, here, let me lay the plan out for you, Sullivan, alright?

853
00:47:21,660 --> 00:47:24,540
How much money do we need? A hundred thousand dollars? Right?

854
00:47:24,540 --> 00:47:26,140
Ten mil... I think it's ten million.

855
00:47:26,140 --> 00:47:26,780
Ten million?

856
00:47:26,780 --> 00:47:27,980
Something like that, yeah.

857
00:47:27,980 --> 00:47:29,980
So we go to the human traffickers...

858
00:47:29,980 --> 00:47:35,420
We show them this really fine specimen of a Yoda, right?

859
00:47:35,420 --> 00:47:38,220
Aren't you the last of your kind, Botas?

860
00:47:38,220 --> 00:47:40,620
That's a great point first. We have to get him in shape

861
00:47:40,620 --> 00:47:47,780
Blow toss is the last of his kind wouldn't he be more of a rare specimen shouldn't we sell him shut up?

862
00:47:47,780 --> 00:47:52,940
You're already in the net dude come on come in

863
00:47:52,940 --> 00:47:58,100
You couldn't get out of the net if you tried you already tried it didn't work

864
00:47:58,100 --> 00:48:03,340
I'm looking at my I'm looking at my phone right now. I'm looking at that. You don't have a phone and you lost

865
00:48:06,580 --> 00:48:12,480
This is why we're selling you because you're a liar. I found a phone in the trunk you are going

866
00:48:12,480 --> 00:48:18,240
I don't use I am selling you as soon as possible. No, okay, so all right

867
00:48:18,240 --> 00:48:24,200
I'm just gonna start asking people I get out of the car first pedestrian. Do you want to buy a guy?

868
00:48:24,200 --> 00:48:29,280
What kind of guy

869
00:48:29,280 --> 00:48:32,460
He's green. Yeah small green

870
00:48:33,020 --> 00:48:37,580
Yeah, sure. I'll take a look. Okay. Well here he is. I bring the the net

871
00:48:37,580 --> 00:48:47,460
See how he does he's a feisty one

872
00:48:47,460 --> 00:48:54,600
You do really well in an underground Yoda fighting ring if you're into that sort of point

873
00:48:54,600 --> 00:49:01,140
Underground Yoda fighting ring. Yeah, he's sort of a he's like bleeding a bit from his finger. I bite the other finger

874
00:49:01,140 --> 00:49:02,140
Yeah!

875
00:49:02,140 --> 00:49:07,600
See, he's one of the feistiest yodas around.

876
00:49:07,600 --> 00:49:11,220
You can tell that he's just ready to breed.

877
00:49:11,220 --> 00:49:15,820
Okay, well, uh, look.

878
00:49:15,820 --> 00:49:18,300
Ten million dollars!

879
00:49:18,300 --> 00:49:20,900
Take it or leave it!

880
00:49:20,900 --> 00:49:26,820
I unload, I pull the needler out of my back pocket and I unload half of the spikes into

881
00:49:26,820 --> 00:49:27,820
the guy.

882
00:49:27,820 --> 00:49:30,940
Okay, roll an attack roll on this guy.

883
00:49:30,940 --> 00:49:32,940
We really should have taken his gun.

884
00:49:32,940 --> 00:49:33,940
Yeah.

885
00:49:33,940 --> 00:49:34,940
That was a huge overshot.

886
00:49:34,940 --> 00:49:35,940
Do I roll?

887
00:49:35,940 --> 00:49:36,940
Do I roll?

888
00:49:36,940 --> 00:49:37,940
So just go to your, go to your, hit Needler.

889
00:49:37,940 --> 00:49:38,940
Oh yeah.

890
00:49:38,940 --> 00:49:39,940
In your, yeah.

891
00:49:39,940 --> 00:49:40,940
Eight damage.

892
00:49:40,940 --> 00:49:46,180
Yeah, unfortunately his AC is a little higher, but now you just pull out a gun and just shoot

893
00:49:46,180 --> 00:49:48,300
it at this guy and he's like, "Oh God!"

894
00:49:48,300 --> 00:49:55,140
And he like sort of swiftly dodges like, "Ah, ah, ah, ah, look boys, look, it's a fine offer,

895
00:49:55,140 --> 00:49:56,700
but this Yoda's too much for me."

896
00:49:56,700 --> 00:49:57,700
And he...

897
00:49:57,700 --> 00:49:58,700
Twenty million dollars.

898
00:49:58,700 --> 00:50:01,700
You're gonna give me 20 million dollars to take this Yoda?

899
00:50:01,700 --> 00:50:03,700
You can buy it for 30 million dollars.

900
00:50:03,700 --> 00:50:06,700
We will give you 20 million dollars to take this Yoda.

901
00:50:06,700 --> 00:50:09,700
Hold on. Hold on. Are you gonna give me 20 million dollars?

902
00:50:09,700 --> 00:50:10,700
Yes.

903
00:50:10,700 --> 00:50:14,700
Okay. Let's see it.

904
00:50:14,700 --> 00:50:19,700
I'm gonna have to... I'll have to write you a...

905
00:50:19,700 --> 00:50:21,700
He hits him. He hits him. Yeah, I mean, how do you kill him?

906
00:50:21,700 --> 00:50:23,700
Patrick rolled another Needler attack.

907
00:50:23,700 --> 00:50:25,700
How do you kill him? He's a pedestrian.

908
00:50:25,700 --> 00:50:27,700
We were this close!

909
00:50:27,700 --> 00:50:35,060
I shoot him straight in the head, two needles go through his eyes.

910
00:50:35,060 --> 00:50:38,620
And then I go and I reach into his wallet and I pull out 20 million dollars.

911
00:50:38,620 --> 00:50:41,060
He didn't have 20.

912
00:50:41,060 --> 00:50:42,880
He couldn't even pull out the tab.

913
00:50:42,880 --> 00:50:48,380
I pull out a thumb drive that has 20 million on a USB stick and I turn to Caleb and I say

914
00:50:48,380 --> 00:50:49,380
uh...

915
00:50:49,380 --> 00:50:50,380
We don't have 20, come on.

916
00:50:50,380 --> 00:50:51,380
Batches, you gotta jump in here.

917
00:50:51,380 --> 00:50:52,380
He was lying to us.

918
00:50:52,380 --> 00:50:55,140
No, yeah, he doesn't have 20 million dollars.

919
00:50:55,140 --> 00:50:56,140
I mean I can tell you that.

920
00:50:56,140 --> 00:50:57,140
Okay, he's got 20 bucks.

921
00:50:57,140 --> 00:50:58,460
Yeah, he does have $20.

922
00:50:58,460 --> 00:51:01,060
Okay, now we just have to do that a million more times and we're good.

923
00:51:01,060 --> 00:51:02,420
No, that's a start.

924
00:51:02,420 --> 00:51:03,460
Uh, yeah.

925
00:51:03,460 --> 00:51:08,700
And yeah, so you, you do that and you shoot him and, uh, you get the 20,

926
00:51:08,700 --> 00:51:13,460
$20 out of it and, uh, uh, uh, Sullivan, the frog's like, Oh God.

927
00:51:13,460 --> 00:51:17,700
And he sort of, uh, takes the body and shoves it in the trunk of his, uh,

928
00:51:17,700 --> 00:51:20,180
Ryan Dunn car.

929
00:51:20,180 --> 00:51:23,180
All right.

930
00:51:23,180 --> 00:51:24,540
We got to get rid of this guy.

931
00:51:24,540 --> 00:51:26,180
Uh, eat him.

932
00:51:26,220 --> 00:51:28,900
- Professor Sullivan, try and eat the body.

933
00:51:28,900 --> 00:51:29,740
- Yeah, eat the whole body.

934
00:51:29,740 --> 00:51:30,580
I wanna know what you're doing.

935
00:51:30,580 --> 00:51:31,400
- Come on.

936
00:51:31,400 --> 00:51:32,780
- That's it, I'm making an executive decision.

937
00:51:32,780 --> 00:51:35,500
We're going to my cousin, John Carlos' place.

938
00:51:35,500 --> 00:51:36,340
You don't know what to do with this.

939
00:51:36,340 --> 00:51:37,180
- All right, let's go.

940
00:51:37,180 --> 00:51:38,260
John Carlos, the bullfrog.

941
00:51:38,260 --> 00:51:39,100
- Maybe.

942
00:51:39,100 --> 00:51:40,780
- And so yeah, he drives you guys.

943
00:51:40,780 --> 00:51:42,980
He's in a frantic.

944
00:51:42,980 --> 00:51:44,540
He's frantic, in a panic.

945
00:51:44,540 --> 00:51:47,260
He drives you guys down to the slums of Gun City.

946
00:51:47,260 --> 00:51:50,900
- And while he's driving, I turn to him and I say,

947
00:51:50,900 --> 00:51:53,220
"Don't worry, I got this."

948
00:51:53,220 --> 00:51:56,020
And I pick up the body out of the truck

949
00:51:56,020 --> 00:51:57,940
and I pop the trunk open.

950
00:51:57,940 --> 00:51:59,460
I throw it out. - So you're in the car.

951
00:51:59,460 --> 00:52:01,760
- I'm in the trunk still with the body.

952
00:52:01,760 --> 00:52:02,600
- You're in the trunk.

953
00:52:02,600 --> 00:52:03,420
(laughing)

954
00:52:03,420 --> 00:52:07,140
- And I look, I assess the situation of us

955
00:52:07,140 --> 00:52:10,340
with a dead body in the car and going to see a guy.

956
00:52:10,340 --> 00:52:12,540
And I say to Blotas,

957
00:52:12,540 --> 00:52:14,620
hey man, have you ever seen Pulp Fiction?

958
00:52:14,620 --> 00:52:15,900
(laughing)

959
00:52:15,900 --> 00:52:17,220
Kind of reminds me of Pulp Fiction.

960
00:52:17,220 --> 00:52:19,380
Hope Giancarlo doesn't drop the N-word.

961
00:52:19,380 --> 00:52:21,660
- I throw the body.

962
00:52:21,660 --> 00:52:22,860
- He won't, you don't have to worry about that.

963
00:52:22,860 --> 00:52:24,140
He won't do that. - I open the--

964
00:52:24,140 --> 00:52:25,340
- I'm worried.

965
00:52:25,340 --> 00:52:26,780
Okay, well you shouldn't be.

966
00:52:26,780 --> 00:52:30,620
I'm in the trunk, I pull that little, that glow in the dark thing

967
00:52:30,620 --> 00:52:33,740
out on the trunk, and then I just toss the body out on the highway.

968
00:52:33,740 --> 00:52:36,940
Okay, roll sleight of hand, see if Solomon notices.

969
00:52:36,940 --> 00:52:41,820
Whoa, Matt won.

970
00:52:41,820 --> 00:52:49,340
Yeah, you just like, get the body, you try to get the body out of the car,

971
00:52:49,340 --> 00:52:54,060
and it's just like, it's just, you're like too little, so it's like, it's just the guy's legs

972
00:52:54,060 --> 00:52:59,340

00:54:26,900 --> 00:54:27,900
uh... guy

1005
00:54:27,900 --> 00:54:29,700
he's playing uh...

1006
00:54:29,700 --> 00:54:32,660
displaying halo combat of all the next box

1007
00:54:32,660 --> 00:54:33,540
and uh...

1008
00:54:33,540 --> 00:54:36,820
he has an eye patch is bulky looking bullfrog

1009
00:54:36,820 --> 00:54:41,980
he's wearing a uh... a uh... wife beater or a hate and assure

1010
00:54:41,980 --> 00:54:43,420
and uh...

1011
00:54:43,420 --> 00:54:48,420
he has the same when you get to know pan style situation and solvent does

1012
00:54:48,420 --> 00:54:51,660
and solvents are the out there like uh... i don't know what to do it and i

1013
00:54:51,660 --> 00:54:54,420
think that's a part of it and then and then they shot him in the head with me

1014
00:54:54,420 --> 00:54:55,620
lord

1015
00:54:55,620 --> 00:54:58,000
he's like is a calm down calm down

1016
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:01,320
andy's what he's got a school you guys

1017
00:55:01,320 --> 00:55:04,860
and you see just sort of a he takes out of the t_v_ smoking a j_d_ just sort of

1018
00:55:04,860 --> 00:55:07,240
uh... he puts it on a window sill

1019
00:55:07,240 --> 00:55:08,780
he says i see guys up

1020
00:55:08,780 --> 00:55:11,860
and worse i've learned that c_e_o_

1021
00:55:11,860 --> 00:55:15,060
I force push the joint out of the window sill.

1022
00:55:15,060 --> 00:55:16,900
What the hell man?

1023
00:55:16,900 --> 00:55:19,940
Do you want to buy him?

1024
00:55:19,940 --> 00:55:21,980
Not after that, I want to put him down.

1025
00:55:21,980 --> 00:55:24,480
I force pull the joint back up.

1026
00:55:24,480 --> 00:55:27,740
Would you pay us money to let you kill him?

1027
00:55:27,740 --> 00:55:28,740
That's right.

1028
00:55:28,740 --> 00:55:30,700
That was a cool trick right?

1029
00:55:30,700 --> 00:55:33,100
I'm pretty cool looking now huh?

1030
00:55:33,100 --> 00:55:38,020
Look, we need to find a way to either get into the Matrix 2 or figure out where somebody

1031
00:55:38,020 --> 00:55:39,260
is in there.

1032
00:55:39,260 --> 00:55:42,380
I see. The Matrix too.

1033
00:55:42,380 --> 00:55:44,380
We also have to sell our friend.

1034
00:55:44,380 --> 00:55:45,380
Yeah.

1035
00:55:45,380 --> 00:55:46,380
And his dead body.

1036
00:55:46,380 --> 00:55:51,620
Do you know any really fucked up human traffickers? Like really depraved people?

1037
00:55:51,620 --> 00:55:55,020
Wait, hold on. How much for a dead body?

1038
00:55:55,020 --> 00:55:57,460
How much for a dead body? Zero.

1039
00:55:57,460 --> 00:55:59,100
How much? No.

1040
00:55:59,100 --> 00:56:01,620
Come on, but really.

1041
00:56:01,620 --> 00:56:02,620
You have to know some creeps.

1042
00:56:02,620 --> 00:56:03,620
No money.

1043
00:56:03,620 --> 00:56:04,620
But what about...

1044
00:56:04,620 --> 00:56:05,620
I know plenty of creeps.

1045
00:56:05,620 --> 00:56:06,620
What about a...

1046
00:56:06,620 --> 00:56:07,620
Why do you mean I have to know some creeps?

1047
00:56:07,620 --> 00:56:12,620
'Cause you're the guy that knows the people.

1048
00:56:12,620 --> 00:56:15,820
- What, okay, what about how much for a dead body

1049
00:56:15,820 --> 00:56:19,400
and also two rounds of needle or ammo?

1050
00:56:19,400 --> 00:56:21,080
- There we go.

1051
00:56:21,080 --> 00:56:22,780
- Included with the dead body.

1052
00:56:22,780 --> 00:56:26,280
- And I just found a rubber band in my pocket.

1053
00:56:26,280 --> 00:56:28,900
How about I sweeten the deal with a rubber band?

1054
00:56:28,900 --> 00:56:31,000
- Hold on. - Tell us.

1055
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:32,920
- Hold on here. - What are you trying to do?

1056
00:56:32,920 --> 00:56:34,200
What do you need all that money for?

1057
00:56:34,200 --> 00:56:35,040
- Okay, all right.

1058
00:56:35,040 --> 00:56:37,220
- I have another item for sale.

1059
00:56:37,220 --> 00:56:39,220
*laughter*

1060
00:56:39,220 --> 00:56:41,220
What? Wait, hold on, let's hear him out.

1061
00:56:41,220 --> 00:56:43,220
What do you have?

1062
00:56:43,220 --> 00:56:45,220
He's still in the net.

1063
00:56:45,220 --> 00:56:47,220
I've taken one of my Super Mario Sunshine

1064
00:56:47,220 --> 00:56:49,220
stickers and I've put it on the eyes

1065
00:56:49,220 --> 00:56:51,220
of this dead body

1066
00:56:51,220 --> 00:56:53,220
to cover up the needlers.

1067
00:56:53,220 --> 00:56:55,220
The needlers ammo. Now what do you think?

1068
00:56:55,220 --> 00:56:57,220
I think...

1069
00:56:57,220 --> 00:56:59,220
I don't have a lot

1070
00:56:59,220 --> 00:57:01,220
of thoughts on this. It's just pretty

1071
00:57:01,220 --> 00:57:03,220
alarming. You don't know any

1072
00:57:03,220 --> 00:57:05,220
You don't know any greeks who would have

1073
00:57:05,220 --> 00:57:07,660
sex with a dead body that we could sell this to?

1074
00:57:07,660 --> 00:57:09,380
John Carlos, John Carlos.

1075
00:57:09,380 --> 00:57:11,380
Don't doubt how many creeps I know.

1076
00:57:11,380 --> 00:57:13,940
Listen, you don't know any rich creeps?

1077
00:57:13,940 --> 00:57:15,140
John Carlos, John Carlos.

1078
00:57:15,140 --> 00:57:18,140
We're gonna give you the dead body, okay?

1079
00:57:18,140 --> 00:57:21,780
And we're gonna give you 10 million dollars.

1080
00:57:21,780 --> 00:57:25,700
Alright? And then you're gonna give us 20 million dollars.

1081
00:57:25,700 --> 00:57:27,700
And you get to keep the dead body.

1082
00:57:27,700 --> 00:57:29,780
That's a pretty good deal.

1083
00:57:29,780 --> 00:57:31,980
I hate that deal.

1084
00:57:31,980 --> 00:57:33,980
I'm taking my stickers back.

1085
00:57:33,980 --> 00:57:37,900
What do you guys need the money for so why'd you bring these guys more stickers?

1086
00:57:37,900 --> 00:57:41,800
We need it. We need to restart the matrix -

1087
00:57:41,800 --> 00:57:49,940
Yeah, twiddling our thumbs looking down. Yeah, we we have to we have to get in the matrix to do

1088
00:57:49,940 --> 00:57:52,580
Michelle we

1089
00:57:52,580 --> 00:57:58,380
Need we need to we got a restarted machine. We do a lemonade stand outside your house. I

1090
00:58:01,340 --> 00:58:02,660
Mean knock yourself out

1091
00:58:02,660 --> 00:58:06,780
But if you're just trying to get into the matrix to that I can maybe help you with

1092
00:58:06,780 --> 00:58:13,580
As far as the dead body goes hold on one second and he takes it and he sort of like heaves it and you realize that

1093
00:58:13,580 --> 00:58:16,140
Next to his Xbox. It's just a giant incinerator

1094
00:58:16,140 --> 00:58:24,220
All right, I like you did I get my stickers back

1095
00:58:25,460 --> 00:58:31,980
You see that there's a little like a receptacle on top of the the incinerator that where the stickers were deposited

1096
00:58:31,980 --> 00:58:39,220
And and before you take the stickers he puts his hand over it not so fast though

1097
00:58:39,220 --> 00:58:41,640
now I

1098
00:58:41,640 --> 00:58:48,820
Just did something for you. And now you're also asking me to take you to the matrix - you I mean you

1099
00:58:48,820 --> 00:58:52,900
It wasn't that big of a deal. You already had the incinerator. Oh, yeah, you didn't ask us

1100
00:58:52,900 --> 00:59:08,580
this

1101
00:59:08,580 --> 00:59:09,920
Say in numbers.

1102
00:59:09,920 --> 00:59:14,920
No, no, our president's electricity control bill.

1103
00:59:14,920 --> 00:59:17,220
Our president's electricity control bill?

1104
00:59:17,220 --> 00:59:18,660
What the fuck are you talking about?

1105
00:59:18,660 --> 00:59:22,060
It's like rent control.

1106
00:59:22,060 --> 00:59:22,560
Look--

1107
00:59:22,560 --> 00:59:24,460
All electricity in the city has to be--

1108
00:59:24,460 --> 00:59:25,020
Wait, guys.

1109
00:59:25,020 --> 00:59:25,780
--controlled by us.

1110
00:59:25,780 --> 00:59:30,100
I just thought of how we can make the money in no time.

1111
00:59:30,100 --> 00:59:31,300
How much money?

1112
00:59:31,300 --> 00:59:32,460
$10 million.

1113
00:59:32,460 --> 00:59:34,580
All we have to do is buy--

1114
00:59:34,580 --> 00:59:36,540
I thought we needed $20 million.

1115
00:59:36,540 --> 00:59:40,020
All we have to do is we gotta buy three microphones

1116
00:59:40,020 --> 00:59:42,520
and an audio recorder, okay?

1117
00:59:42,520 --> 00:59:48,380
And in a month's time, we're gonna be making the big bucks.

1118
00:59:48,380 --> 00:59:50,960
- That's a great idea.

1119
00:59:50,960 --> 00:59:55,380
- If you guys want to get into the Matrix 2,

1120
00:59:55,380 --> 00:59:56,900
I'd be happy to help you out with that

1121
00:59:56,900 --> 01:00:00,740
and put you in touch with the Mad Suckler.

1122
01:00:00,740 --> 01:00:05,300
Now, look, I can't be asking him for too many favors

1123
01:00:05,300 --> 01:00:07,640
or else he'll stop, you know.

1124
01:00:07,640 --> 01:00:10,060
Yeah, it's just a tenuous relationship.

1125
01:00:10,060 --> 01:00:12,360
He's a stop suckling.

1126
01:00:12,360 --> 01:00:15,240
Well, now, at least on my stop suckling you.

1127
01:00:15,240 --> 01:00:18,440
That's you got. Yeah. Look.

1128
01:00:18,440 --> 01:00:23,840
Look, what I need from you guys, though, if you have,

1129
01:00:23,840 --> 01:00:27,000
I'm going to put you in touch with him is I'm going to need

1130
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:30,740
some of that new techno slime truck,

1131
01:00:30,740 --> 01:00:33,680
the red eye stuff.

1132
01:00:33,680 --> 01:00:34,680
How much?

1133
01:00:34,680 --> 01:00:36,600
Oh wait, is that different?

1134
01:00:36,600 --> 01:00:38,000
10 million dollars or nothing!

1135
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:42,700
Wait, wait, is that different from, uh, is that the unrefined stuff or is that the cowboy

1136
01:00:42,700 --> 01:00:45,920
bebop one that I have?

1137
01:00:45,920 --> 01:00:47,920
It's a bebop one that you have.

1138
01:00:47,920 --> 01:00:48,920
Okay.

1139
01:00:48,920 --> 01:00:49,920
Alright.

1140
01:00:49,920 --> 01:00:51,400
So do you have it?

1141
01:00:51,400 --> 01:00:52,640
I do have it.

1142
01:00:52,640 --> 01:00:58,320
Um, wait, what, he said he's gonna take us to the Mad Suckla if...

1143
01:00:58,320 --> 01:01:01,440
If you guys, if you give me enough.

1144
01:01:01,440 --> 01:01:02,440

1174
01:03:23,860 --> 01:03:28,980
that scene from now you see me this is just becoming an episode of Ed Ed and

1175
01:03:28,980 --> 01:03:34,020

01:04:05,780 --> 01:04:13,200
that he was pretty excited by that and he's like, okay, He's

1183
01:04:13,200 --> 01:04:14,200
thinking about it.

1184
01:04:14,200 --> 01:04:15,200
Cool.

1185
01:04:15,200 --> 01:04:20,360
If you give me both of those, I'll take you to the mad suckler.

1186
01:04:20,360 --> 01:04:21,360
You idiot.

1187
01:04:21,360 --> 01:04:23,760
I don't, I mean, I don't.

1188
01:04:23,760 --> 01:04:25,280
No, we gotta save one.

1189
01:04:25,280 --> 01:04:26,280
What if we give you one?

1190
01:04:26,280 --> 01:04:27,280
Yeah, we only have one.

1191
01:04:27,280 --> 01:04:28,280
I'm sorry, your eyes are all messed up again.

1192
01:04:28,280 --> 01:04:29,280
I think you're seeing double.

1193
01:04:29,280 --> 01:04:31,240
Your eyes are all messed up again.

1194
01:04:31,240 --> 01:04:33,440
You must have put your glasses back on.

1195
01:04:33,440 --> 01:04:36,960
Look, you tried to trick me one time, and I admit, pretty good trick.

1196
01:04:36,960 --> 01:04:37,960
And it worked.

1197
01:04:37,960 --> 01:04:38,960
And now I'm trying again.

1198
01:04:38,960 --> 01:04:39,960
You are wearing a monocle.

1199
01:04:39,960 --> 01:04:40,960
No, I'm not.

1200
01:04:40,960 --> 01:04:41,960
I'm wearing an eye patch.

1201
01:04:41,960 --> 01:04:42,960
I mean, if we give you...

1202
01:04:42,960 --> 01:04:44,160
You only have one eye.

1203
01:04:44,160 --> 01:04:45,160
Nobody's ever told you.

1204
01:04:45,160 --> 01:04:46,160
You are a Cyclops.

1205
01:04:46,160 --> 01:04:47,160
You have one eye.

1206
01:04:47,160 --> 01:04:48,160
So I point to the...

1207
01:04:48,160 --> 01:04:49,160
I point to the...

1208
01:04:49,160 --> 01:04:50,160
I point to the...

1209
01:04:50,160 --> 01:04:51,160
Not Cyclops.

1210
01:04:51,160 --> 01:04:52,160
I point to the eye tube stuff...

1211
01:04:52,160 --> 01:04:54,040
Do not call me Cyclops!

1212
01:04:54,040 --> 01:05:01,560
And I point to the eye tube stuff and the two unrefined ones and I'm like, "Look, this

1213
01:05:01,560 --> 01:05:03,680
is an incredible value, okay?

1214
01:05:03,680 --> 01:05:10,520
We're giving you six tubes of Techno Slime."

1215
01:05:10,520 --> 01:05:15,560
I don't see why you need to ask for 12 or whatever it is you're saying right now.

1216
01:05:15,560 --> 01:05:18,160
I have told you what I'm asking.

1217
01:05:18,160 --> 01:05:20,160
Quick sidebar.

1218
01:05:20,160 --> 01:05:22,640
With both John and Patrick.

1219
01:05:22,640 --> 01:05:23,640
Okay.

1220
01:05:23,640 --> 01:05:24,640
Yeah.

1221
01:05:24,640 --> 01:05:25,640
Sure, yeah.

1222
01:05:25,640 --> 01:05:27,960
You guys walk a few feet over to huddle.

1223
01:05:27,960 --> 01:05:30,080
Why do we need to keep two of these things?

1224
01:05:30,080 --> 01:05:34,120
Sullivan's apologizing to Conroe meanwhile.

1225
01:05:34,120 --> 01:05:36,240
This stuff is super heavy.

1226
01:05:36,240 --> 01:05:38,520
I'm getting tired lugging it around.

1227
01:05:38,520 --> 01:05:40,020
I don't really care.

1228
01:05:40,020 --> 01:05:44,460
I probably know Papi Chuco made that stuff and I'm not convinced he's uh...

1229
01:05:44,460 --> 01:05:48,980
entirely truthful. I think we should hold on to it as evidence uh... and

1230
01:05:48,980 --> 01:05:51,420
in just in case. You never know.

1231
01:05:51,420 --> 01:05:54,480
You know somebody might ask, somebody might say hey

1232
01:05:54,480 --> 01:05:57,360
I heard Papi Chuco's making that crazy stuff and then we don't have any

1233
01:05:57,360 --> 01:05:59,640
evidence to prove it.

1234
01:05:59,640 --> 01:06:03,380
What have we been talking about?

1235
01:06:03,380 --> 01:06:07,820
Here, this is what we're gonna ask him, right? I still have that backpack full of snacks

1236
01:06:07,820 --> 01:06:15,660
from the first episode of the arc okay I'm sorry I had my headphones in I still

1237
01:06:15,660 --> 01:06:24,420
have this Santa clip that I've been listening to an audiobook on. Can we

1238
01:06:24,420 --> 01:06:32,700
start this conversation over again? What happened Pat? Did you just zone out?

1239
01:06:32,700 --> 01:06:34,940
Yeah, Patrick was watching videos again.

1240
01:06:34,940 --> 01:06:39,340
I wasn't zoning out or anything, I just thought this would be funny.

1241
01:06:39,340 --> 01:06:41,340
[Laughter]

1242
01:06:41,340 --> 01:06:45,740
I thought this was your sly way of saying that you just have not been paying attention at all.

1243
01:06:45,740 --> 01:06:47,740
[Laughter]

1244
01:06:47,740 --> 01:06:49,740
I thought I was... I laughed.

1245
01:06:49,740 --> 01:06:51,740
No, we can't restart.

1246
01:06:51,740 --> 01:06:53,740
Alright, well...

1247
01:06:53,740 --> 01:06:56,460
If we pool our quarters, how many quarters do we have?

1248
01:06:56,460 --> 01:06:58,460
We can give him some quarters.

1249
01:06:58,460 --> 01:07:00,460
I have 10.

1250
01:07:00,460 --> 01:07:02,460

01:10:27,700 --> 01:10:29,380
across the street.

01:10:29,380 --> 01:10:30,220
And--

1312
01:10:30,220 --> 01:10:34,660

OK, yeah. You cause a six car like a beginning of Final Destination.

1317
01:10:45,100 --> 01:10:47,740
Yeah, final destination.

1318
01:10:47,740 --> 01:10:51,820

01:10:51,820 --> 01:10:56,060
Cool. Yeah. So you guys are back

1320
01:10:56,060 --> 01:11:00,420

01:11:02,460 --> 01:11:04,700
Oh, yeah. So let's go hang out, too.

1323
01:11:04,700 --> 01:11:06,940
Yeah, so this can do.

1324
01:11:06,940 --> 01:11:08,380
Let's have a boys day out.

1325
01:11:08,380 --> 01:11:10,780
Well, you know what?

1326
01:11:10,780 --> 01:11:13,680
We've been so focused on solving this mystery.

1327
01:11:13,680 --> 01:11:15,280
Yeah, especially this session.

1328
01:11:15,280 --> 01:11:15,940
Yeah.

1329
01:11:15,940 --> 01:11:21,680
Ignoring that dig from the from patches.

1330
01:11:21,680 --> 01:11:26,480
We've been so focused on this mystery

1331
01:11:26,480 --> 01:11:28,380
that we haven't focused on our friendship.

1332
01:11:28,380 --> 01:11:32,980
Yeah, we need to do some serious work to get Patrick Yoda

1333
01:11:32,980 --> 01:11:35,980
to trust us again after we tried to sell him to human traffickers.

1334
01:11:36,480 --> 01:11:39,280
"Hey Patrick, do you wanna go hang out in that restaurant?"

1335
01:11:39,280 --> 01:11:45,480
And I point across the street to a storefront that has, um, it has a cardboard sign that says "Restaurant"

1336
01:11:45,480 --> 01:11:50,280
that's kinda like hanging askew a little bit, and you can see underneath it, it says "Human Trafficking Hub"

1337
01:11:50,280 --> 01:11:54,480
*laughter*

1338
01:11:54,480 --> 01:11:56,880
"Ooooh, that one's good!"

1339
01:11:56,880 --> 01:11:59,280
"I heard they have really delicious pizza!"

1340
01:11:59,280 --> 01:12:03,480
"I'm- I'm gonna roll Perception to see if I-"

1341
01:12:03,480 --> 01:12:04,680
*laughter*

1342
01:12:04,680 --> 01:12:05,280
"Do it!"

1343
01:12:05,280 --> 01:12:10,880
A 10? Yeah, you can kind of tell.

1344
01:12:10,880 --> 01:12:14,720
I see the word. It's a new restaurant.

1345
01:12:14,720 --> 01:12:21,320
You can tell it's not a great restaurant. Like, you might not want to eat there.

1346
01:12:21,320 --> 01:12:26,500
I wouldn't like to eat there. Well, they have the craziest secret menu.

1347
01:12:26,500 --> 01:12:30,620
They have those smiley face french fries. I hate those.

1348
01:12:30,620 --> 01:12:33,040
- let's go laugh at them

1349
01:12:33,040 --> 01:12:41,620
Well gee I don't know

1350
01:12:41,620 --> 01:12:45,500
Come on

1351
01:12:45,500 --> 01:12:49,480
Just like we used to we can write a hilarious one-star Yelp review

1352
01:12:49,480 --> 01:12:53,680
We can go make fun of those french fries and how bad all the food is

1353
01:12:54,140 --> 01:13:00,980
And I was stupid that's I come on that signs not fooling anybody everybody knows this restaurant suck come on Patrick

1354
01:13:00,980 --> 01:13:06,220
What is the sign say why why is the sign bad because it's made of cardboard? Oh?

1355
01:13:06,220 --> 01:13:12,660
See this is God come on. This would be like as a gag like like let's go to the air. We'll make a video

1356
01:13:12,660 --> 01:13:16,420
Yeah, we'll make a documentary video that about

1357
01:13:16,420 --> 01:13:20,220
Yeah about you eating at the worst restaurant in the world

1358
01:13:21,140 --> 01:13:24,140
We'll add some cool sound effects and stuff. Yeah

1359
01:13:24,140 --> 01:13:28,960
Right. Hmm. What do you say buddy? Well

1360
01:13:28,960 --> 01:13:33,100
Gee I don't know I

1361
01:13:33,100 --> 01:13:37,340
Mean can we

1362
01:13:37,340 --> 01:13:43,620
There that has a play place, but we know that Burger King is good like this place, you know, it'll be funny

1363
01:13:43,620 --> 01:13:47,380
It's like a bad movie. That's it's like so bad. It's good exactly

1364
01:13:47,900 --> 01:13:54,460
But does it have a play place is the problem? I'm pretty sure it does. Yeah, actually I'm looking at Yelp right now

1365
01:13:54,460 --> 01:13:56,460
Yeah, does it have a play place? I pull out my Junebug

1366
01:13:56,460 --> 01:13:59,440
I pull out my Junebug with no screen and I look at well

1367
01:13:59,440 --> 01:14:04,480
I mean, yeah, the Yelp reviews all say it's like the worst restaurant, but the best play place

1368
01:14:04,480 --> 01:14:11,240
Well, I'm not going into the restaurant. Can we go into the side door that says play place?

1369
01:14:11,240 --> 01:14:15,800
Yeah, let's go into the back door. Actually, let's go knock on the back door. That's a better idea for sure

1370
01:14:15,940 --> 01:14:23,860
Yeah, you guys go into the back door of this restaurant slash human trafficking. He's the net comfy for you Patrick

1371
01:14:23,860 --> 01:14:34,300
It's not comfortable

1372
01:14:43,980 --> 01:14:49,380
Okay, so we walk in this yeah, I was so I walk up to the kids at a counter. Yeah, there's a counter

1373
01:14:49,380 --> 01:14:51,760
there's a woman there she looks like the

1374
01:14:51,760 --> 01:14:56,740
The woman in Monsters Inc. There's like the secretary. Yeah

1375
01:14:56,740 --> 01:15:04,820
Yeah, she looks just like her. Yeah, I say just how much how much for a I and I wink green meal

1376
01:15:04,820 --> 01:15:07,100
small size

1377
01:15:07,100 --> 01:15:09,260
Yeah, she she she

1378
01:15:10,660 --> 01:15:15,480
She like leans over and looks to Patrick Yoda up and down

1379
01:15:15,480 --> 01:15:18,240
and she says

1380
01:15:18,240 --> 01:15:20,240
17 tokens

1381
01:15:20,240 --> 01:15:23,940
You see

1382
01:15:23,940 --> 01:15:28,560
Patrick has rolled a needler in the chat silently

1383
01:15:28,560 --> 01:15:31,500
Okay. Yeah, I

1384
01:15:31,500 --> 01:15:37,180
Jump in front of it to save this woman's life. Okay a few things to resolve here

1385
01:15:38,680 --> 01:15:46,140
Okay, are you shooting the needler? Yeah. All right, we're gonna roll for initiative in that case

1386
01:15:46,140 --> 01:15:49,320
Because these are human traffickers

1387
01:15:49,320 --> 01:15:51,800
And so they can fight

1388
01:15:51,800 --> 01:15:55,780
Okay, let's do it everyone roll for initiative I

1389
01:15:55,780 --> 01:16:00,800
Don't want to fight them. I'm gonna smell Patrick. I'm on their side. Okay

1390
01:16:06,680 --> 01:16:09,960
I'll roll initiative. I'll defend my friend Patrick.

1391
01:16:09,960 --> 01:16:13,760
I don't know why you guys thought he'd be worth 10 million dollars.

1392
01:16:13,760 --> 01:16:16,240
I mean he's cool, it's because we love him. He's cool as hell.

1393
01:16:16,240 --> 01:16:18,720
He's worth 10 million dollars to us.

1394
01:16:18,720 --> 01:16:21,080
Exactly Patrick, that should make you feel really good.

1395
01:16:21,080 --> 01:16:23,920
He's so upset.

1396
01:16:23,920 --> 01:16:29,200
You can't needler me in real life Patrick.

1397
01:16:29,200 --> 01:16:33,600
You don't hurt me when you press that button. Not yet.

1398
01:16:33,600 --> 01:16:36,240
You can't- 22 actually might- that might hurt me.

1399
01:16:36,240 --> 01:16:37,240
That might hurt him.

1400
01:16:37,240 --> 01:16:39,600
Wait, roll for initiative, Pat.

1401
01:16:39,600 --> 01:16:40,600
He did, he got a 7.

1402
01:16:40,600 --> 01:16:42,600
No, no, the first time he got a 7.

1403
01:16:42,600 --> 01:16:43,600
No, I got a 21.

1404
01:16:43,600 --> 01:16:44,600
Also, he's in a net.

1405
01:16:44,600 --> 01:16:45,600
No, you didn't.

1406
01:16:45,600 --> 01:16:46,600
I got a 21.

1407
01:16:46,600 --> 01:16:48,040
He got a 7 and he's in a fucking net, dude.

1408
01:16:48,040 --> 01:16:49,040
He's dead.

1409
01:16:49,040 --> 01:16:50,040
No, I got a 21.

1410
01:16:50,040 --> 01:16:52,400
Because I didn't notice, I'm gonna give him a-

1411
01:16:52,400 --> 01:16:53,400
What?

1412
01:16:53,400 --> 01:16:54,760
Alright, that's the new rule.

1413
01:16:54,760 --> 01:17:01,360
If you can roll something and re-roll it before Pat just notices, you get the second roll.

1414
01:17:01,360 --> 01:17:02,360
Fuck off.

1415
01:17:02,360 --> 01:17:07,520
Alright, let me make some notes on this battle.

1416
01:17:07,520 --> 01:17:10,120
God damn.

1417
01:17:10,120 --> 01:17:11,120
We're killing time.

1418
01:17:11,120 --> 01:17:12,120
We have until 10 o'clock.

1419
01:17:12,120 --> 01:17:16,360
Yeah, might as well kill an entire store full of human traffickers.

1420
01:17:16,360 --> 01:17:17,360
I mean we're doing a good thing.

1421
01:17:17,360 --> 01:17:19,820
Yeah, we're doing the world a favor.

1422
01:17:19,820 --> 01:17:21,960
This was our plan all along, Patrick.

1423
01:17:21,960 --> 01:17:23,200
We're ridding the world of this scum.

1424
01:17:23,200 --> 01:17:26,280
You win with it perfectly, buddy.

1425
01:17:26,280 --> 01:17:29,800
Patrick still thinks it's a restaurant.

1426
01:17:29,800 --> 01:17:33,720
This restaurant has the worst service of all time.

1427
01:17:33,720 --> 01:17:34,720
You shot at them.

1428
01:17:34,720 --> 01:17:39,160
All right, let me roll for initiative for all of them.

1429
01:17:39,160 --> 01:17:40,160
All of them?

1430
01:17:40,160 --> 01:17:41,160
How many?

1431
01:17:41,160 --> 01:17:42,160
Oh, no.

1432
01:17:42,160 --> 01:17:47,140
So there are four people there.

1433
01:17:47,140 --> 01:17:49,120
There's a secretary.

1434
01:17:49,120 --> 01:18:02,920
Then there's one of the beefy guards there who looks exactly like Ken Bone.

1435
01:18:02,920 --> 01:18:11,520
And then there is two other guys and they also both look like Ken Bone.

1436
01:18:11,520 --> 01:18:12,520
They're triplets.

1437
01:18:12,520 --> 01:18:13,520
They're triplet human triplets.

1438
01:18:13,520 --> 01:18:16,520
Oh no, the Bone Brothers.

1439
01:18:16,520 --> 01:18:21,560
Yeah, it's yeah, they're the Bone Brothers, they're famous.

1440
01:18:21,560 --> 01:18:23,960
Direct descendant of Ken Bone.

1441
01:18:23,960 --> 01:18:31,200
Yeah, who became a despot in the mid-21st century.

1442
01:18:31,200 --> 01:18:37,080
Yeah, he became an infamous white rapper in Brooklyn.

1443
01:18:37,080 --> 01:18:39,560
And White Bone is a white rapper.

1444
01:18:39,560 --> 01:18:46,840
Yeah, Ken Bone, but like the E and the and the E's in Bone and Ken are dollar signs for

1445
01:18:46,840 --> 01:18:47,840
some reason.

1446
01:18:47,840 --> 01:18:50,320
It's going to put it somewhere.

1447
01:18:50,320 --> 01:18:51,320
It's a euro.

1448
01:18:51,320 --> 01:18:52,320
One of them's a euro.

1449
01:18:52,320 --> 01:18:53,320
Yeah.

1450
01:18:53,320 --> 01:18:54,320
Yeah, yeah.

1451
01:18:54,320 --> 01:18:56,240
One of them, he got it right.

1452
01:18:56,240 --> 01:18:57,240
Yeah.

1453
01:18:57,240 --> 01:18:58,240
Okay, cool.

1454
01:18:58,240 --> 01:19:00,600
So Patrick Yoda, actually, that was your turn first.

1455
01:19:00,600 --> 01:19:04,020
Okay, that role I missed.

1456
01:19:04,020 --> 01:19:06,280
So I'll give you I'll give you like a little layout.

1457
01:19:06,280 --> 01:19:10,480
I'm gonna use a samurai, the samurai pack.

1458
01:19:10,480 --> 01:19:14,680
Whoa, we got a whole crew smoking samurai pack.

1459
01:19:14,680 --> 01:19:19,720
Okay, these are, these are Ken bones.

1460
01:19:19,720 --> 01:19:20,720
So they were.

1461
01:19:20,720 --> 01:19:24,160
So Ken bone, human traffics and that's real?

1462
01:19:24,160 --> 01:19:26,760
Yeah, no.

1463
01:19:26,760 --> 01:19:29,980
Ken bone in my fictional world, human traffics.

1464
01:19:29,980 --> 01:19:31,720
So Ken bone is a real human trafficker.

1465
01:19:31,720 --> 01:19:34,800
No, that's not what I'm saying.

1466
01:19:34,800 --> 01:19:35,800
Nope.

1467
01:19:35,800 --> 01:19:38,400
And here's the geisha for the secretary.

1468
01:19:38,400 --> 01:19:42,760
She's beautiful.

1469
01:19:42,760 --> 01:19:44,240
I can't fight her.

1470
01:19:44,240 --> 01:19:45,240
Yeah.

1471
01:19:45,240 --> 01:19:46,240
Uh, great.

1472
01:19:46,240 --> 01:19:50,520
Yeah, this actually, this, this fucking rectangle is perfect for the area.

1473
01:19:50,520 --> 01:19:51,520
So okay.

1474
01:19:51,520 --> 01:19:56,800
So yeah, Patrick Yoda, you actually did, uh, shoot at her first.

1475
01:19:56,800 --> 01:19:58,360
And what did you roll for that shot?

1476
01:19:58,360 --> 01:19:59,360
The first shot?

1477
01:19:59,360 --> 01:20:00,360
13.

1478
01:20:00,360 --> 01:20:01,360
Yeah.

1479
01:20:01,360 --> 01:20:02,360
Okay.

1480
01:20:02,360 --> 01:20:03,360
No, no, no.

1481
01:20:03,360 --> 01:20:04,360
Wait.

1482
01:20:04,360 --> 01:20:05,360
Uh, 12.

1483
01:20:05,360 --> 01:20:10,400
shoot at her with the needler and she's sort of using her geisha secretary

1484
01:20:10,400 --> 01:20:15,960
technique very easily like dodges it and sort of repositions herself but you're

1485
01:20:15,960 --> 01:20:19,560
gonna get to go again because you roll first initiative. Is he still in the net?

1486
01:20:19,560 --> 01:20:23,480
Does he have to get out of the net? If he's in the net then yeah he needs to

1487
01:20:23,480 --> 01:20:26,520
use at least half his just just to use half his movement to get out of it.

1488
01:20:26,520 --> 01:20:34,340
That's right. Well can I wait can I do stuff from the net still? Yeah I guess

1489
01:20:34,340 --> 01:20:35,180
- Yes, you can.

1490
01:20:35,180 --> 01:20:37,020
Yeah, you can technically do stuff from the net, for sure.

1491
01:20:37,020 --> 01:20:40,720
- There's holes in the net, if it's a butterfly net.

1492
01:20:40,720 --> 01:20:41,740
- Yeah. - Yeah.

1493
01:20:41,740 --> 01:20:43,300
- Yeah, if you wanna do stuff from the net,

1494
01:20:43,300 --> 01:20:45,500
you definitely can.

1495
01:20:45,500 --> 01:20:48,500
- Okay, so my needler,

1496
01:20:48,500 --> 01:20:51,060
well, obviously a needler through a butterfly net

1497
01:20:51,060 --> 01:20:52,400
is gonna burn a hole.

1498
01:20:52,400 --> 01:20:54,460
- Yeah.

1499
01:20:54,460 --> 01:20:57,180
- So I just stick my arm out of the butterfly net

1500
01:20:57,180 --> 01:21:00,180
with the needler, and I'm just sitting in the net

1501
01:21:00,180 --> 01:21:03,420
with just the needler out of the butterfly net.

1502
01:21:04,260 --> 01:21:07,360
Okay, yeah, so what do you shoot at that?

1503
01:21:07,360 --> 01:21:09,960
What does Needler explosion do?

1504
01:21:09,960 --> 01:21:11,660
I would guess it's an explosion.

1505
01:21:11,660 --> 01:21:14,860
Yeah, Needler explosion happens just like with the real Needler

1506
01:21:14,860 --> 01:21:19,960
where if you attack somebody twice in a row on a turn with the Needler,

1507
01:21:19,960 --> 01:21:25,360
so on one turn of the next turn, then you're going to be able to cause additional damage

1508
01:21:25,360 --> 01:21:28,560
and each consecutive time you do it you cause that additional damage.

1509
01:21:28,560 --> 01:21:31,060
Okay.

1510
01:21:31,060 --> 01:21:35,140

Yeah.

1668
01:31:38,360 --> 01:31:40,180
I'm in love with the secretary!

1669
01:31:40,180 --> 01:31:42,820
And he just sort of jams his elbow in your head.

1670
01:31:42,820 --> 01:31:48,180
Hey, I'm using my perception to realize that that's the first time that she's heard that.

1671
01:31:48,180 --> 01:31:50,660
Yeah, yeah.

1672
01:31:50,660 --> 01:31:52,340
She's trying not to react.

1673
01:31:52,340 --> 01:31:53,620
It's too overwhelming.

1674
01:31:53,620 --> 01:31:54,340
This is a Jim and Pam thing.

1675
01:31:54,340 --> 01:31:55,640
Yeah.

1676
01:31:55,640 --> 01:31:56,920
(laughs)

1677
01:31:56,920 --> 01:31:59,440
- They had a Jim and Pam thing going on.

1678
01:31:59,440 --> 01:32:01,440
- And I'm like the cameraman.

1679
01:32:01,440 --> 01:32:03,520
(laughs)

1680
01:32:03,520 --> 01:32:04,920
From the later seasons.

1681
01:32:04,920 --> 01:32:07,720
- Yeah, like how the cameraman tried to suck Pam's toes.

1682
01:32:07,720 --> 01:32:09,280
(laughs)

1683
01:32:09,280 --> 01:32:10,320
- Yeah, like that.

1684
01:32:10,320 --> 01:32:12,360
- I remember that scene.

1685
01:32:12,360 --> 01:32:17,720
Yeah, now she's like, "Oh, Ken too."

1686
01:32:17,720 --> 01:32:20,520
(laughs)

1687
01:32:20,520 --> 01:32:23,160
And she tries to kick you again in the head.

1688
01:32:23,160 --> 01:32:24,280
See how she does.

1689
01:32:25,080 --> 01:32:26,880
She gets to hurt me twice, dude.

1690
01:32:26,880 --> 01:32:28,280
She fucks it up, though.

1691
01:32:28,280 --> 01:32:31,480
She's too distracted by her, like, confused emotions,

1692
01:32:31,480 --> 01:32:33,280
and she just whiffs,

1693
01:32:33,280 --> 01:32:35,280
and you just get to keep sucking on her toes.

1694
01:32:35,280 --> 01:32:36,880
Man, I'd like a whiff on her.

1695
01:32:36,880 --> 01:32:38,480
Yeah, that's good.

1696
01:32:38,480 --> 01:32:40,080
Come over here. Join me.

1697
01:32:40,080 --> 01:32:41,280
Get this kid boned.

1698
01:32:41,280 --> 01:32:42,680
[laughter]

1699
01:32:42,680 --> 01:32:46,280
It is now Patrick Yoda's turn.

1700
01:32:46,280 --> 01:32:47,480
Alright, um...

1701
01:32:47,480 --> 01:32:48,080
Yeah.

1702
01:32:48,080 --> 01:32:51,680
I use... how many tech... I have 13 techno sign points.

1703
01:32:51,680 --> 01:32:54,480
Yeah, you guys are a way... I mean, these are not...

1704
01:32:54,480 --> 01:32:58,000
How many, how many techno, how many techno slime point?

1705
01:32:58,000 --> 01:32:59,600
What does Yoda's mind do again?

1706
01:32:59,600 --> 01:33:02,000
Yoda's mind allows you to read people's mind.

1707
01:33:02,000 --> 01:33:02,500
Right.

1708
01:33:02,500 --> 01:33:05,200
It'd be a crazy thing to pull out right now.

1709
01:33:05,200 --> 01:33:07,600
It uses like most of your techno slime points.

1710
01:33:07,600 --> 01:33:09,200
Just kill the guy.

1711
01:33:09,200 --> 01:33:15,120
I was gonna use Yoda's mind to get into the head of Ken Bone 2

1712
01:33:15,120 --> 01:33:16,320
and then make fun of him.

1713
01:33:16,320 --> 01:33:22,240
Or you could shoot him with your gun that can do like 20 damage.

1714
01:33:22,240 --> 01:33:28,640
Hold on, I was gonna make fun of him about his love for the secretary until he kills himself.

1715
01:33:28,640 --> 01:33:31,600
Or you could shoot him with the gun.

1716
01:33:31,600 --> 01:33:37,360
Patrick, I just have to say, there's a guy right next to us right now.

1717
01:33:37,360 --> 01:33:40,080
You have a lot more of two options.

1718
01:33:40,080 --> 01:33:42,240
Which is the unfortunate thing.

1719
01:33:42,240 --> 01:33:45,680
I just got a notification that Patrick is playing Garry's Mod.

1720
01:33:48,320 --> 01:33:52,160
I just got a notification on Steam that says you are on Gary's Mod right now.

1721
01:33:52,160 --> 01:33:54,800
[Laughter]

1722
01:33:54,800 --> 01:33:56,080
Care to explain yourself?

1723
01:33:56,080 --> 01:33:58,080
I'm really not.

1724
01:33:58,080 --> 01:34:02,720
What, this isn't enough game for you, Pat?

1725
01:34:02,720 --> 01:34:06,560
It says Tim Allen is on Gary's Mod.

1726
01:34:06,560 --> 01:34:11,440
That must be a you problem, not a me problem.

1727
01:34:11,440 --> 01:34:12,480
All right, I just wanted to, you know.

1728
01:34:12,480 --> 01:34:14,080
It's not open for me.

1729
01:34:14,080 --> 01:34:14,400
Okay.

1730
01:34:16,960 --> 01:34:18,960
Alright, anyway.

1731
01:34:18,960 --> 01:34:20,960
So what do you think I should do?

1732
01:34:20,960 --> 01:34:22,960
Patrick.

1733
01:34:22,960 --> 01:34:24,960
Patrick Yoda.

1734
01:34:24,960 --> 01:34:26,960
I look deep into his eyes.

1735
01:34:26,960 --> 01:34:28,960
I really appreciate that you apologized to me for running away that one time.

1736
01:34:28,960 --> 01:34:30,960
And I'm thinking about apologizing to you for trying to sell you into slavery.

1737
01:34:30,960 --> 01:34:32,960
But, if you don't kill this guy right next to us right now, I won't apologize.

1738
01:34:32,960 --> 01:34:34,960
This is a very important question.

1739
01:34:34,960 --> 01:34:36,960
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to answer it.

1740
01:34:36,960 --> 01:34:38,960
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to answer it.

1741
01:34:38,960 --> 01:34:40,960
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to answer it.

1742
01:34:40,960 --> 01:34:42,960
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to answer it.

1743
01:34:42,960 --> 01:34:44,960
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to answer it.

1744
01:34:44,960 --> 01:34:50,960
This is a really tender emotional moment. The music swells before he answers.

1745
01:34:50,960 --> 01:34:55,960
Yeah, the music's swelling. Ken Bone and Secretary are both just like, "HUH!"

1746
01:34:55,960 --> 01:34:58,960
Like, waiting to hear what happens.

1747
01:34:58,960 --> 01:35:03,960
So then I use my hoverboard, and I'm gonna hit... Can I hit both the Ken Bone?

1748
01:35:03,960 --> 01:35:07,960
'Cause if it's like the hoverboard boomerang, I can hit all three of them, right?

1749
01:35:07,960 --> 01:35:10,960
Yeah, roll for attack on that.

1750
01:35:10,960 --> 01:35:13,960
That hits all of them. Roll for damage.

1751
01:35:13,960 --> 01:35:15,280
- Nice, yeah.

1752
01:35:15,280 --> 01:35:20,280
You whap, this one, this guy over here is dead

1753
01:35:20,280 --> 01:35:23,760
and you hit these two.

1754
01:35:23,760 --> 01:35:27,400
She's looking pretty busted.

1755
01:35:27,400 --> 01:35:28,640
He's looking okay.

1756
01:35:28,640 --> 01:35:30,140
Describe how you kill this guy.

1757
01:35:30,140 --> 01:35:34,040
- So I hit, so I--

1758
01:35:34,040 --> 01:35:35,360
- Very tender Roman.

1759
01:35:35,360 --> 01:35:37,920
- Through the net, I kick,

1760
01:35:37,920 --> 01:35:41,120
I've basically just destroyed the net at this point.

1761
01:35:41,120 --> 01:35:41,960
- Yes.

1762
01:35:41,960 --> 01:35:48,960
the

1763
01:35:48,960 --> 01:35:52,020
you wearing it like a leather face

1764
01:35:52,020 --> 01:35:57,720
and i can't be i think the hoverboard boomerang through the net and it hits

1765
01:35:57,720 --> 01:36:01,200
uh... that guy it kind of just stays

1766
01:36:01,200 --> 01:36:04,000
spinning off the guy it's a good case of

1767
01:36:04,000 --> 01:36:09,400
such a bad concussion that he dies in the equivalent of a car accident

1768
01:36:09,400 --> 01:36:12,560
and i have other to uh...

1769
01:36:12,560 --> 01:36:14,640
it just a it doesn't normally

1770
01:36:14,640 --> 01:36:17,280
Yeah, the other two ran out of ideas.

1771
01:36:17,280 --> 01:36:17,780
Yeah.

1772
01:36:17,780 --> 01:36:19,980
Yeah, the other two take some damage.

1773
01:36:19,980 --> 01:36:22,880
Okay, cool. Yeah, that guy's dead in front of you.

1774
01:36:22,880 --> 01:36:24,480
Uh, uh...

1775
01:36:24,480 --> 01:36:27,900
I throw up on him because I'm still not good at seeing dead bodies.

1776
01:36:27,900 --> 01:36:30,780
Yeah, you guys have killed two human traffickers today.

1777
01:36:30,780 --> 01:36:31,720
That's a good start.

1778
01:36:31,720 --> 01:36:32,720
Nice.

1779
01:36:32,720 --> 01:36:35,720
Uh, and now...

1780
01:36:35,720 --> 01:36:36,720
Shit.

1781
01:36:36,720 --> 01:36:41,840
Yeah, you killed two of them, so now it's actually, uh, Blowtoss, it's your turn.

1782
01:36:41,840 --> 01:36:42,980
That's right.

1783
01:36:42,980 --> 01:36:46,480
Um, alright, I uh...

1784
01:36:46,480 --> 01:36:48,480
Aaron, go give him a wedgie.

1785
01:36:48,480 --> 01:36:49,480
I'm sorry.

1786
01:36:49,480 --> 01:36:51,480
Lotus, go give that man a wedgie!

1787
01:36:51,480 --> 01:36:59,480
I look at Patrick and I extend hands to shake his hand and I say, "That sounds good to me."

1788
01:36:59,480 --> 01:37:02,480
And we shake hands.

1789
01:37:02,480 --> 01:37:03,480
Yeah, you shake hands.

1790
01:37:03,480 --> 01:37:04,480
We shake hands.

1791
01:37:04,480 --> 01:37:06,480
And then I run over to Ken Bone and give him a wedgie.

1792
01:37:06,480 --> 01:37:08,480
Absolutely, yeah, just roll it.

1793
01:37:08,480 --> 01:37:12,480
An atomic wedgie. I pull his underwear so far out it's gonna chop his freakin' legs off.

1794
01:37:12,480 --> 01:37:18,720
Yeah, roll a strength check and we'll sort of do an opposed strength. All right, I got an 11

1795
01:37:18,720 --> 01:37:21,760
Okay. Oh he beat you. So yeah, he is

1796
01:37:21,760 --> 01:37:30,400
Industrial reinforced underwear, so you try to pull it up and he's like that the fat between his legs is too. Yeah

1797
01:37:30,400 --> 01:37:33,520
Yeah, he's like not today Satan and he

1798
01:37:33,520 --> 01:37:38,200
Okay, so then I hit him in the face with my lid

1799
01:37:40,840 --> 01:37:44,240
That's a nine. Oh, no, it's not gonna do it. Yeah, you're like

1800
01:37:44,240 --> 01:37:52,200
Frustrated you start swinging. He's just suddenly like like just like fucking like it man like fucking dodging your shit

1801
01:37:52,200 --> 01:37:56,160
I'm here now, by the way. Yeah. Yes. Yes. That is where you would be

1802
01:37:56,160 --> 01:37:59,680
He's like I have the power of love on my side

1803
01:37:59,680 --> 01:38:09,360
And now it is your turn Caleb, I'm sorry for my suggestion of the wedgie, it's okay. That's what's friends are for friendship

1804
01:38:09,360 --> 01:38:17,760
Um, I I mean again, I keep it old-school. I just use that ladies face like a fucking speed bag

1805
01:38:17,760 --> 01:38:25,880
I'm definitely gonna hit it this time guys. Don't even worry about it. I

1806
01:38:25,880 --> 01:38:29,200
Mean, it's not 17 roll

1807
01:38:29,200 --> 01:38:31,560
roll a

1808
01:38:31,560 --> 01:38:33,560
D4 now, okay

1809
01:38:33,560 --> 01:38:36,280
Yeah

1810
01:38:36,280 --> 01:38:38,280
Yeah, how do you kill her?

1811
01:38:39,120 --> 01:38:43,120
had to help. She had she had more. She had she had about

1812
01:38:43,120 --> 01:38:45,760
seven seven or eight was what I was thinking because she's

1813
01:38:45,760 --> 01:38:50,320
pretty weak. Right and you just like kind of like just crested

1814
01:38:50,320 --> 01:38:55,680
it. How do you kill her? I I kip up from the ground. uh cuz I

1815
01:38:55,680 --> 01:39:00,400
took two years of Taekwondo and then you just start just like I

1816
01:39:00,400 --> 01:39:03,600
said just like on her chin just over and over and over and over

1817
01:39:03,600 --> 01:39:06,480
again and I'm like dodging even though she's not punching back.

1818
01:39:06,480 --> 01:39:08,760
Yeah, practicing right?

1819
01:39:08,760 --> 01:39:10,220
And then I just do one final,

1820
01:39:10,220 --> 01:39:14,720
just like knockout uppercut and she flies into the ceiling and it's like a drop

1821
01:39:14,720 --> 01:39:19,300
ceiling and she gets her head stuck in there and dangling.

1822
01:39:19,300 --> 01:39:21,420
Yeah, that was bad ass.

1823
01:39:21,420 --> 01:39:23,260
And then I started stuck in on her toes again.

1824
01:39:23,260 --> 01:39:29,180
Yeah. You're now like on top of her under right under her,

1825
01:39:29,180 --> 01:39:31,980
right under her. Just like, like a, like a hamster feeding

1826
01:39:31,980 --> 01:39:35,340
on her big toe.

1827
01:39:35,340 --> 01:39:37,580
(laughing)

1828
01:39:37,580 --> 01:39:42,220
- Yeah, you see the Ken Bone is like,

1829
01:39:42,220 --> 01:39:44,540
like so angry. - And I also moon him.

1830
01:39:44,540 --> 01:39:46,980
- Oh, no. - I left side to him.

1831
01:39:46,980 --> 01:39:49,660
- Oh, he is so mad at you. - Yeah.

1832
01:39:49,660 --> 01:39:51,660
- He is losing his fucking mind.

1833
01:39:51,660 --> 01:39:53,960
So he's gonna come over and try to hit you.

1834
01:39:53,960 --> 01:39:55,980
- Oh, I say, "Toro, Toro,"

1835
01:39:55,980 --> 01:39:58,180
and then wave my ass like a red flag.

1836
01:39:58,180 --> 01:40:00,460
(laughing)

1837
01:40:00,460 --> 01:40:03,300
And right as he almost gets me, I move out of the way.

1838
01:40:03,300 --> 01:40:04,580
Just oh is that what happens?

1839
01:40:04,580 --> 01:40:06,060
Let's find out.

1840
01:40:06,060 --> 01:40:07,380
Just sucking on his toe.

1841
01:40:07,380 --> 01:40:10,580
You're just sucking on his dead woman's toes.

1842
01:40:10,580 --> 01:40:14,300
- Yeah.

1843
01:40:14,300 --> 01:40:15,140
- Oh man.

1844
01:40:15,140 --> 01:40:16,340
- Run him into the wall.

1845
01:40:16,340 --> 01:40:20,220
- Yeah and he's gonna try to beat your ass.

1846
01:40:20,220 --> 01:40:21,220
See how he does.

1847
01:40:21,220 --> 01:40:22,220
- He will miss.

1848
01:40:22,220 --> 01:40:25,180
- He does miss.

1849
01:40:25,180 --> 01:40:26,820
- He does miss.

1850
01:40:26,820 --> 01:40:28,580
He says I loved her almost as much

1851
01:40:28,580 --> 01:40:30,140
as I loved human trafficking.

1852
01:40:30,140 --> 01:40:31,340
And he tries to hit you.

1853
01:40:32,420 --> 01:40:36,420
and he misses though he's too angry he's crying he's got stingy tears running

1854
01:40:36,420 --> 01:40:37,340
down

1855
01:40:37,340 --> 01:40:39,100
uh... inside knows

1856
01:40:39,100 --> 01:40:40,500
and uh... uh...

1857
01:40:40,500 --> 01:40:42,820

1858
01:40:42,820 --> 01:40:45,060

01:40:45,060 --> 01:40:49,420

1860
01:40:49,420 --> 01:40:51,500
with the yoda's mind

1861
01:40:51,500 --> 01:40:53,980
this is what he's one guy left

1862
01:40:53,980 --> 01:40:57,460
i know but i want to go out there

1863
01:40:57,460 --> 01:41:00,620
All right. Well, this fight is already taking like 45 minutes.

1864
01:41:00,620 --> 01:41:02,540
All right. You know what, then?

1865
01:41:02,540 --> 01:41:05,540
Hoagie surprise.

1866
01:41:05,540 --> 01:41:09,100
Yeah, I'm finally I'm finally out of the net.

1867
01:41:09,100 --> 01:41:11,140
I pulled my hoagie out.

1868
01:41:11,140 --> 01:41:13,340
That's what's up. I hit him with the hoagie surprise.

1869
01:41:13,340 --> 01:41:14,940
You do roll the damage.

1870
01:41:14,940 --> 01:41:19,660
The remainder of the net is just on Patrick's legs like fishnet stockings.

1871
01:41:19,660 --> 01:41:23,660
I start sucking on his toes instead.

1872
01:41:23,660 --> 01:41:24,460
They look better.

1873
01:41:25,660 --> 01:41:30,940
Yeah, he's so yeah, you whack him right in the skull and his head spins around.

1874
01:41:30,940 --> 01:41:32,140
I gotta hit him in the nuts.

1875
01:41:32,140 --> 01:41:36,780
You hit him in the nuts and he makes a he makes a soy face in response.

1876
01:41:36,780 --> 01:41:40,460
He's excited by it and uh, but he's still standing.

1877
01:41:40,460 --> 01:41:43,820
He looks pretty fucked up, but you guys haven't done enough damage to this guy yet.

1878
01:41:43,820 --> 01:41:45,020
So it's your turn, Blowtoss.

1879
01:41:45,020 --> 01:41:48,780
Oh no, um, we should pants him.

1880
01:41:48,780 --> 01:41:51,340
All right, yeah, for my first action I pants him.

1881
01:41:51,340 --> 01:41:52,860
Let's humiliate this guy.

1882
01:41:52,860 --> 01:41:54,860
Let's just humiliate him as much as possible.

1883
01:41:54,860 --> 01:41:57,980
I'll count pantsing as an attack action.

1884
01:41:57,980 --> 01:41:59,180
Yeah, so go for it.

1885
01:41:59,180 --> 01:42:00,820
We're kind of the bad guys now.

1886
01:42:00,820 --> 01:42:01,900
Roll strength.

1887
01:42:01,900 --> 01:42:02,980
Strength, roll strength.

1888
01:42:02,980 --> 01:42:04,980
He has to have really strong pants.

1889
01:42:04,980 --> 01:42:07,660
Let's see, he has a resistance of 22.

1890
01:42:07,660 --> 01:42:08,580
Oh, there we go.

1891
01:42:08,580 --> 01:42:09,620
Let's see how he does.

1892
01:42:09,620 --> 01:42:12,060
I mean, unless he crits, he probably won't do it.

1893
01:42:12,060 --> 01:42:15,940
Yeah, no, you whip those pants right.

1894
01:42:15,940 --> 01:42:17,460
Oh, yeah.

1895
01:42:17,460 --> 01:42:19,540
And he's going to take

1896
01:42:19,540 --> 01:42:21,260
the damage.

1897
01:42:21,260 --> 01:42:24,860
He's gonna take 1d4 psychic damage.

1898
01:42:24,860 --> 01:42:33,260
So he's just like so humiliated and he's watching as his dead love of his life is getting her toes sucked on and

1899
01:42:33,260 --> 01:42:36,260
and he's just...

1900
01:42:36,260 --> 01:42:39,260
[laughter]

1901
01:42:39,260 --> 01:42:42,260
We've done so much to this human traffickers.

1902
01:42:42,260 --> 01:42:45,260
He's a human trafficker, dude.

1903
01:42:45,260 --> 01:42:48,260
Yeah, he sells people into slavery.

1904
01:42:48,260 --> 01:42:50,660
It's like how people end up like working in insurance.

1905
01:42:50,660 --> 01:42:54,660
Like, you know, like you could just be a normal guy.

1906
01:42:54,660 --> 01:42:58,260
Yeah, human trafficking is just like insurance.

1907
01:42:58,260 --> 01:43:00,960
And more so than you would think.

1908
01:43:00,960 --> 01:43:05,460
Hey, hey, he's he's crying.

1909
01:43:05,460 --> 01:43:07,460
He's like it's so much pain.

1910
01:43:07,460 --> 01:43:10,460
He's like, please, please spare me.

1911
01:43:10,460 --> 01:43:11,960
I take his shirt off.

1912
01:43:11,960 --> 01:43:15,360
I pee on him.

1913
01:43:17,160 --> 01:43:46,620
roll

1914
01:43:46,620 --> 01:43:53,460
When I take his shirt off, it turns out he had one of those Iron Man type heart pacemaker

1915
01:43:53,460 --> 01:43:56,060
things implanted into his chest, right?

1916
01:43:56,060 --> 01:43:59,140
But he was so sweaty from the fight that it stuck to his shirt.

1917
01:43:59,140 --> 01:44:04,220
So when I take his shirt off, it just rips his heart battery right out of his chest.

1918
01:44:04,220 --> 01:44:06,740
It just collapses to the ground.

1919
01:44:06,740 --> 01:44:08,780
That's so bleak.

1920
01:44:08,780 --> 01:44:09,780
Oh, man.

1921
01:44:09,780 --> 01:44:11,780
Hey, that's what happens, dude.

1922
01:44:11,780 --> 01:44:14,500
Yeah, you just hear, "Boooooo!"

1923
01:44:14,500 --> 01:44:15,660
As he rips it out of it.

1924
01:44:15,660 --> 01:44:17,660
He's really upset about dying.

1925
01:44:17,660 --> 01:44:19,660
He's swearing up a storm.

1926
01:44:19,660 --> 01:44:23,660
And he's just having a seizure on the ground and then just like dies.

1927
01:44:23,660 --> 01:44:26,660
Yeah, and then I stand over his body and I'm like,

1928
01:44:26,660 --> 01:44:31,660
"That's what you get for letting us walk into your building."

1929
01:44:31,660 --> 01:44:35,660
And I think we'll end it there.

1930
01:44:35,660 --> 01:44:42,660
Yeah, so next time we'll start, you guys will...

1931
01:44:42,660 --> 01:44:46,500
guys will it'll be it'll be 10 p.m.

1932
