00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
We can talk about the houses real quick, actually.

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,000
We can talk about our Harry Potter houses.

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Patrick would be Hufflepuff.

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Patrick is Hufflepuff, apparently.

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
I did take the test.

10
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Which test? Is there an official one?

11
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:36,000
an official sorted hat thing. Does it have a proctor? No. It's just some fat guy. It's

12
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:43,000
a fat nerd in a rope. It's a fat guy in a witch hat. In a rope. Yeah, you're in some

13
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:50,800
middle school. At 730 taking the placement test. Like the ACT. Yeah. He walks up and

14
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:58,800
down the aisles and he smells you. It's just like British school. Yeah. But I did take

15
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:01,040
- Because that's their standardized test they take.

16
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:02,960
- Their standardized test in England

17
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:05,680
is they have to take the Harry Potter house.

18
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:06,520
- Yeah.

19
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:07,920
(laughing)

20
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:12,920
- But I did take it on the Harry Potter website.

21
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:14,480
- Pottermore.

22
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:16,080
- Pottermore, yeah.

23
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:19,520
My Hogwarts house is Hufflepuff

24
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:24,520
and the United States one is like Ilvermorny or something.

25
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:25,520
- There's a United States Harry Potter.

26
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:26,720
- They have US different houses?

27
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:28,640
One second, I have to look up this.

28
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:29,640
I have to look up this.

29
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:32,880
You know what, that's what we're doing today is you guys are going to take your Pottermore

30
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:33,880
quizzes.

31
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:34,880
I'll take a Pottermore quiz.

32
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:35,880
Yeah.

33
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:36,880
Pottermore.

34
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:37,880
Yeah.

35
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:38,880
Let's go.

36
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:39,880
This is so fucking stupid.

37
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:40,880
Alright.

38
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:41,880

Okay, I do not have a wizarding passport.

45
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:55,200
You do have to log in with your wizarding passport.

74
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:15,320
horned serpent

75
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:19,320
a great horned river serpent with a jewel set into its forehead i guess it's just

76
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:22,960
just the description of what the creatures are yeah but it's a little

77
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:27,960
unbalanced puck wedgie a short gray face large eared creature Thunderbird a

78
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:33,160
creature that can create storms as it flies and whampus a magical panther like

79
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:37,360
a magical panther like creature that is fast strong and almost impossible to

00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:44,720
kill yeah it's pretty one of those the boys yeah yeah you want to be a mortal or

81
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:45,720
Do you want to be a puck wedgie?

82
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:46,720
Yeah, do you want to be a short, gray-faced creature?

83
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:47,720
I'm a fucking puck wedgie, dude.

84
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:48,720
I'm a puck wedgie.

85
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:54,920
Yeah, the trade-off is you have to, it's called a wampus.

86
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:56,840
You have to say, "I'm a wampus."

87
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:58,320
Still better than puck wedgie.

88
00:03:58,320 --> 00:03:59,320
Yeah.

89
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:02,800
They had an announcement video for it.

90
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:03,800
Whoa.

91
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:04,800
Yeah.

92
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:05,800
It's huge.

93
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:06,800
Big news.

94
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:09,980
More big news, separately.

95
00:04:09,980 --> 00:04:11,360
The UCB is gone.

96
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:12,360
Oh yeah.

97
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:13,360
Oh my God.

98
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:15,860
This is our first post-UCB episode.

99
00:04:15,860 --> 00:04:18,000
- Oh my gosh, finally.

100
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,440
- Never been to the building.

101
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:24,120
I've never stepped foot in a, I've never taken a class.

102
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:25,580
I've never taken an improv class,

103
00:04:25,580 --> 00:04:28,260
but this really affected me deep.

104
00:04:28,260 --> 00:04:29,800
- Yeah, me too.

105
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:32,240
You guys know I have a history with UCB.

106
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:34,640
And so I actually wrote a little,

107
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:36,440
I wrote a little memorial for them.

108
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:37,280
- Whoa.

109
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:38,100
- Do you guys wanna hear it?

110
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:39,240
- Yeah.

111
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:40,080
- Okay.

112
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:48,920
What was the Upright Citizens Brigade?

113
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:54,080
A name that will forever echo through the hallowed halls of comedy alongside other titans of

114
00:04:54,080 --> 00:05:01,200
improv like Greg Proops and Big L. It was also a place, much like Cambodian death camps

115
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:05,800
or the murderous castle of H.H. Holmes were both places.

116
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:11,040
It was a school, a school that marketed itself as accredited even after it lost its accreditation

117
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:16,440
in 2017 due to a lack of handicap accessibility, which is actually something they told me when

118
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:17,580
I worked there.

119
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:20,400
That is true.

120
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:24,280
But the UCB was more than a name, more than a place, more than a school.

121
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:26,120
It was a family.

122
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:35,160
A family of weirdos, freaks, rapists, CIA agents, cannibals, and very funny women.

123
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:38,360
They say improv theatres die twice.

124
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:42,640
Once when its blatant mismanagement leads to declining ticket sales, empty classes, and

125
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:47,040
the eventual closure of the theatre, and the second time when somebody speaks its name

126
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:52,040
one final time while describing where exactly they were sexually assaulted.

127
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:58,880
UCB, the place that, when asked whether or not they are in fact a cabal of satanic pedophiles,

128
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:02,000
they responded with a hearty "Yes, and."

129
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:07,360
You are already so missed.

130
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:12,560
And as a former employee of the UCB, Caleb knows more than anyone.

131
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:13,560
That is true.

132
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:17,180
As someone who was let into their little satanic pedo cabal.

133
00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:18,180
I was.

134
00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:21,040
I got to see behind the curtain.

135
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:22,040
It was awesome, man.

136
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:23,040
It was perfect.

137
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:28,040
It was like, every day was that scene in Broad City when Hillary Clinton walks in.

138
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:32,360
Yeah, because she was walking in every day to pick up a new baby.

139
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:39,400
Yeah, yeah, dude. It fucking rocked, man. This one's for you, UCB. We miss you, boys.

140
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:46,360
We're pouring one out for the UCB. We're re-watching that sketch where Amy Poehler

141
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:50,200
does Chinese Face. Yeah, dude.

142
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:57,560
The sickest thing ever is to make every single improv scene just about how everyone is retarded

143
00:06:57,560 --> 00:07:00,520
in gay until 2014 and then be like,

144
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:02,720
"If you ever talked like that, you're a piece of shit."

145
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:03,560
- Yeah.

146
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:05,160
- So we miss them, man.

147
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:07,740
I'm pouring out this bottle of Adrenochrome for you guys.

148
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:09,660
Seriously, I mean it.

149
00:07:09,660 --> 00:07:10,500
- Yeah.

150
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:12,340
Wow.

151
00:07:12,340 --> 00:07:13,320
- We should start our own improv theater.

152
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:15,080
- We're gonna watch, we're watching that,

153
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:18,720
the live episode of the UCB show season one

154
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:21,080
and we're looking for Nick Kroll and Paul Shearer

155
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:21,920
in the crowd.

156
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:23,440
- Oh my God, I'm so excited.

157
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:24,880
I love being a fan.

158
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:28,680
we're looking for a new cruel and his highness college years with his little

159
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:30,680
glasses

160
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:32,460
he had little glasses

161
00:07:32,460 --> 00:07:33,080
yeah

162
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:37,040
the a_f_ little cubes at the end of the pieces of flaws you put it at his head

163
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:40,260
you know i just feel awful for you know like the next generation of

164
00:07:40,260 --> 00:07:43,160
underage girls will never get to know the magic

165
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:43,960
of

166
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:49,160

167
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:50,680
all my god

168
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:53,640
there is a doubt that this is leaves a huge void

169
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:57,240
it's true it's such a it's such a hole in the comedy community you know i mean a

170
00:07:57,240 --> 00:08:00,640
whole the normal you see the way to aggressively try to talk about

171
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:05,000

00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:22,760
that's right

178
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:26,700
and everybody's everybody's invited everybody and we change the rules you

179
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:28,380
can say no and now

180
00:08:28,380 --> 00:08:30,700
yeah that's right much whatever you want

181
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:35,340
you honestly had said it's exactly said bastion for free speech and improv

182
00:08:35,340 --> 00:08:37,340
you the improv doesn't have to be funny

183
00:08:37,340 --> 00:08:39,680
i'm like a doesn't seem to be a

184
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:44,420
i'm not going to be so funny or it had to be super funny and it didn't have to

185
00:08:44,420 --> 00:08:48,140
be like uh... why did your character make that choice and it's like

186
00:08:48,140 --> 00:08:50,180
my characters peter griffin

187
00:08:50,180 --> 00:08:52,920
(laughing)

188
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:54,580
- We should do those shows where we,

189
00:08:54,580 --> 00:08:57,460
all of our shows are those awesome improv shows

190
00:08:57,460 --> 00:09:00,660
where you actually get involved as the audience

191
00:09:00,660 --> 00:09:02,860
and we go and we grab your phone.

192
00:09:02,860 --> 00:09:03,700
- Yeah.

193
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:04,540
- And we actually do improv from your phone.

194
00:09:04,540 --> 00:09:06,420
- We do Tinder live.

195
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:08,620
- We do, we actually look at Tinder live.

196
00:09:08,620 --> 00:09:09,460
- Yeah.

197
00:09:09,460 --> 00:09:10,300
- And we make you fuck the person.

198
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:11,900
- We do live Tinder.

199
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:12,740
- I'm serious.

200
00:09:12,740 --> 00:09:14,100
- And we.

201
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:17,260
- We grab your phone and we write down the phone number

202
00:09:17,260 --> 00:09:19,540
of every contact with a female name.

203
00:09:19,540 --> 00:09:23,460
yeah

204
00:09:23,460 --> 00:09:24,900
that's all those shows were

205
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:26,580
they would be like

206
00:09:26,580 --> 00:09:33,580
"oh and you ma'am, can I see your phone?" and they're just air dropping all the photos to themselves

207
00:09:33,580 --> 00:09:37,140
"it's improv you cunt"

208
00:09:37,140 --> 00:09:40,900
man it's so crazy how like

209
00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:41,940
he's got it

210
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:42,820
I've got it

211
00:09:42,820 --> 00:09:43,860
I've got it

212
00:09:43,860 --> 00:09:46,300
it's so crazy how that uh...

213
00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:48,100
how it didn't survive

214
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:49,100
Who would have thought?

215
00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:50,100
Yeah, who would have thought?

216
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:51,100
That would have been unsustainable.

217
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:54,740
20 years of not paying comedians.

218
00:09:54,740 --> 00:09:57,100
And Amy Poehler opening up a winery.

219
00:09:57,100 --> 00:09:59,500
Yeah, who would have fucking thought?

220
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:00,980
And Besser and fucking Wong.

221
00:10:00,980 --> 00:10:07,540
And Besser leaving his credit card all over the office for random interns to take photos

222
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:08,540
of.

223
00:10:08,540 --> 00:10:11,140
It just makes no sense.

224
00:10:11,140 --> 00:10:13,660
It's like how'd you lose that?

225
00:10:13,660 --> 00:10:18,660
They're making a pot themed stand up show partnered with Lyft.

226
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:20,900
Yeah, Besser's spending all that money.

227
00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:22,660
That didn't pull them out the hole?

228
00:10:22,660 --> 00:10:24,420
Spending all that money on research

229
00:10:24,420 --> 00:10:26,300
on how to shrink a man's arms.

230
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:33,680
God damn dude, it will be missed, you know?

231
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:35,420
Truly.

232
00:10:35,420 --> 00:10:36,420
I think I swallowed something wrong.

233
00:10:36,420 --> 00:10:37,340
Yeah, I bet you did.

234
00:10:37,340 --> 00:10:38,180
You know what I got?

235
00:10:38,180 --> 00:10:39,020
Swallowed a germ, dude.

236
00:10:39,020 --> 00:10:41,220
Yeah, I swallowed a big bug.

237
00:10:42,940 --> 00:10:45,940
You remember, remember townhouse flip sides?

238
00:10:45,940 --> 00:10:46,940
What?

239
00:10:46,940 --> 00:10:50,940
The flip side crackers, they're half cracker, half pretzel.

240
00:10:50,940 --> 00:10:51,940
Sounds like me.

241
00:10:51,940 --> 00:10:57,940
That's true, because you're half white, half German.

242
00:10:57,940 --> 00:10:58,940
That's why you shaved your head.

243
00:10:58,940 --> 00:10:59,940
No.

244
00:10:59,940 --> 00:11:00,940
No.

245
00:11:00,940 --> 00:11:01,940
Yeah, that's why you shaved your head.

246
00:11:01,940 --> 00:11:02,940
Take it back.

247
00:11:02,940 --> 00:11:03,940
No, I shaved my head because I'm in Slytherin.

248
00:11:03,940 --> 00:11:04,940
Yeah.

249
00:11:04,940 --> 00:11:07,940
I got recruited by Slytherin in prison.

250
00:11:07,940 --> 00:11:08,940
Yeah.

251
00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:14,220
yeah I have all these Slytherin tattoos from prison and they made me shave my

252
00:11:14,220 --> 00:11:18,500
head and now we're gonna go beat the shit out of some hufflepuffs for speaking Spanish at lunch

253
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:23,700
you're standing there with like the Deathly Hallows tattoo on your chest and

254
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:29,540
you're pointing at your stepdad you're going see this that means not welcome

255
00:11:29,540 --> 00:11:37,140
fuck no I don't remember those those pretzels that you eat oh yeah they're

256
00:11:37,140 --> 00:11:38,860
half pretzel half cracker.

257
00:11:38,860 --> 00:11:41,100
And I haven't had them since I was-

258
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:42,100
The thin pretzels?

259
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:43,100
The pretzel crisps?

260
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:44,100
Yeah, the thin pretzel crackers.

261
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:46,020
No, no, not pretzel crisps.

262
00:11:46,020 --> 00:11:48,980
They're called townhouse flip sides.

263
00:11:48,980 --> 00:11:50,740
That's- they're called pretzel crisps.

264
00:11:50,740 --> 00:11:55,260
I haven't had them, I haven't eaten them since I was like 13 and they were at my friend's

265
00:11:55,260 --> 00:11:58,940
house and his mom got mad at me because I ate the whole box.

266
00:11:58,940 --> 00:12:03,740
You know, in the past I've made jokes about like Patrick has an encyclopedic memory of

267
00:12:03,740 --> 00:12:14,740
the last time he ate every single food but yeah really does things he has a

268
00:12:14,740 --> 00:12:16,740
Okay, okay. Of anything...

269
00:12:16,740 --> 00:12:18,740
Of anything...

270
00:12:18,740 --> 00:12:20,740
Other than like...

271
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:22,740
Yeah, I'm actually a genius.

272
00:12:22,740 --> 00:12:24,740
No, no.

273
00:12:24,740 --> 00:12:26,740
I have a good memory when it comes to...

274
00:12:26,740 --> 00:12:28,740
I have a good memory when it comes to

275
00:12:28,740 --> 00:12:30,740
things like stupid shit like

276
00:12:30,740 --> 00:12:32,740
that.

277
00:12:32,740 --> 00:12:34,740
Food. That's what we're saying.

278
00:12:34,740 --> 00:12:36,740
Food and skateboard stuff.

279
00:12:36,740 --> 00:12:38,740
You have a Sherlock Holmes Mind Palace that you go into

280
00:12:38,740 --> 00:12:40,740
that is a

281
00:12:40,740 --> 00:12:42,740
version of Disney's Magic Kingdom

282
00:12:42,740 --> 00:12:47,420
made out of cotton candy and gumballs and you walk through the halls looking at the paintings

283
00:12:47,420 --> 00:12:52,660
of all the food and they all have plaques that say your coordinates of where you last

284
00:12:52,660 --> 00:12:53,660
ate them.

285
00:12:53,660 --> 00:13:00,300
Well yeah, I know that one, I remember that one because my friend's mom got mad at me.

286
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:04,060
I have an encyclopedic knowledge of every time someone's been mad at me.

287
00:13:04,060 --> 00:13:05,060
Yeah?

288
00:13:05,060 --> 00:13:08,500
When was the last time I was mad at you?

289
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:20,660
in New York when I didn't know how to put the cups away at the pit where I was I

290
00:13:20,660 --> 00:13:25,320
was too high and I didn't know we were standing behind what's her fucking

00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:36,160
Rachel's Senate and I was like Caleb I don't know where to put my cup yeah

292
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:40,340
Patrick didn't he never it was a bar and he didn't think to put the cup back on

293
00:13:40,340 --> 00:13:46,820
the bar well okay I was very sick I was very sick that trip he was very sick and

294
00:13:46,820 --> 00:13:54,740
and he had he had taken a whisper of weed yeah yeah I was also actively having an

295
00:13:54,740 --> 00:14:00,700
allergic reaction to Prilosec OTC isn't that an is that an allergy medicine that

296
00:14:00,700 --> 00:14:02,340
- That is a heartburn medication.

297
00:14:02,340 --> 00:14:05,060
- Oh, yeah, so yeah, I forgot about that.

298
00:14:05,060 --> 00:14:06,380
- Mm-hmm, I gotta add that.

299
00:14:06,380 --> 00:14:08,500
- You were probably fucked up, man.

300
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:12,060
- Yeah, I had that rash, I drank a bunch of Monster Energy.

301
00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:12,900
- We were in New York for like--

302
00:14:12,900 --> 00:14:14,340
- Drank a bunch of gin and tonics.

303
00:14:14,340 --> 00:14:16,040
- We were in New York for like 36 hours,

304
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:19,140
and eight hours in, Patrick was like,

305
00:14:19,140 --> 00:14:22,060
"Man, I miss home so bad."

306
00:14:22,060 --> 00:14:23,620
(laughing)

307
00:14:23,620 --> 00:14:26,900
And he kept talking about how bad he wanted to go home.

308
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:28,580
- Patrick is a hobbit.

309
00:14:28,580 --> 00:14:29,420
- He is, too.

310
00:14:29,420 --> 00:14:36,700
I got absolutely a hobbit. Caleb's an orc. I don't care. I'm not an orc. Yeah you are an orc and I'm a wizard.

311
00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:45,660
No you're Cameron you're a fucking wood elf. I'm a wizard. They don't have wood elves. If anyone is a legolas it's Cameron.

312
00:14:45,660 --> 00:14:53,580
Legolas is not a wood elf. There's elves. Okay that's you. No. Yeah you're a legolas. No I'm Aragorn.

313
00:14:53,580 --> 00:14:55,580
He's uh, you are not Aragorn.

314
00:14:55,580 --> 00:14:57,580
I'm Aragorn.

315
00:14:57,580 --> 00:14:59,580
He's Smeagol.

316
00:14:59,580 --> 00:15:01,580
I'm the Witch King of Angmar.

317
00:15:01,580 --> 00:15:03,580
He's Smeagol.

318
00:15:03,580 --> 00:15:05,580
Caleb's Gimli because he's short.

319
00:15:05,580 --> 00:15:07,580
I'm Mario and Luigi.

320
00:15:07,580 --> 00:15:09,580
You guys are both Gimli.

321
00:15:09,580 --> 00:15:11,580
I am taller than you, Patrick.

322
00:15:11,580 --> 00:15:13,580
Now that you've shaved your head, you're definitely not taller than him.

323
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:15,580
Yeah, you're not going to be taller than me now because you don't have the height of your hair.

324
00:15:15,580 --> 00:15:17,580
Listen to me, I will pay to have a doctor measure us.

325
00:15:17,580 --> 00:15:19,580
Okay.

326
00:15:19,580 --> 00:15:21,580
I'm serious.

327
00:15:21,580 --> 00:15:23,580
pay a doctor to measure us.

328
00:15:23,580 --> 00:15:25,980
Fine, you're not gonna like the answer you gave.

329
00:15:25,980 --> 00:15:26,980
I am gonna like it.

330
00:15:26,980 --> 00:15:27,980
No.

331
00:15:27,980 --> 00:15:28,980
You're gonna like being short?

332
00:15:28,980 --> 00:15:29,980
That's a big step.

333
00:15:29,980 --> 00:15:30,980
No, I'm taller than you.

334
00:15:30,980 --> 00:15:31,980
You're gonna like being short.

335
00:15:31,980 --> 00:15:32,980
You're gonna like being short because then you can go...

336
00:15:32,980 --> 00:15:33,980
I'm so much taller.

337
00:15:33,980 --> 00:15:34,980
Then you can do...

338
00:15:34,980 --> 00:15:40,660
Maybe at one time you were taller than me, but the weight of your body has compressed

339
00:15:40,660 --> 00:15:41,660
your bones.

340
00:15:41,660 --> 00:15:42,660
It's not true.

341
00:15:42,660 --> 00:15:43,660
It's pulling him down to the ground.

342
00:15:43,660 --> 00:15:46,220
You are five feet, if that.

343
00:15:46,220 --> 00:15:49,420
You shaved your head and you lost six inches of height.

344
00:15:49,420 --> 00:15:50,420
That's not true.

345
00:15:50,420 --> 00:15:51,420
Yeah, you did.

346
00:15:51,420 --> 00:15:52,660
You lost six inches.

347
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:54,100
You had a kid in play.

348
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:57,540
You had a thinning kid in play haircut.

349
00:15:57,540 --> 00:15:58,380
No.

350
00:15:58,380 --> 00:15:59,980
And you would do the kid in play dance.

351
00:15:59,980 --> 00:16:00,800
No.

352
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:01,980
To by yourself and no one would join in.

353
00:16:01,980 --> 00:16:02,820
That's not true.

354
00:16:02,820 --> 00:16:03,640
'Cause no one wanted to joke with you.

355
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:04,780
I always measure to the top of my head

356
00:16:04,780 --> 00:16:05,940
and not the top of my hair.

357
00:16:05,940 --> 00:16:06,780
No, you measure to your hair.

358
00:16:06,780 --> 00:16:08,980
You on the other hand, you're also a liar.

359
00:16:08,980 --> 00:16:09,820
No.

360
00:16:09,820 --> 00:16:10,820
Yeah, you're a compulsive liar.

361
00:16:10,820 --> 00:16:11,660
You're lying right now.

362
00:16:11,660 --> 00:16:13,860
I mean, well think about this.

363
00:16:13,860 --> 00:16:15,380
Hufflepuff versus Slytherin.

364
00:16:15,380 --> 00:16:17,100
Slytherin's more likely to lie.

365
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:17,940
Yes, exactly.

366
00:16:17,940 --> 00:16:20,940
No, Slytherin is more likely to be evil.

367
00:16:20,940 --> 00:16:25,540
exactly and the line is lying no line here are not knowing that i'm not even

368
00:16:25,540 --> 00:16:29,420
like the same thing okay not slither is more likely to lie but who's more likely

369
00:16:29,420 --> 00:16:30,940
to fib

370
00:16:30,940 --> 00:16:34,380

So are you. And you're short. So are you. No I'm not.

375
00:16:50,180 --> 00:16:54,580
Okay then say Slytherin's are liars.

376
00:16:54,580 --> 00:16:57,980
Slytherin's are liars but I'm not a Slytherin. You're a Slytherin. See he's lying.

377
00:16:57,980 --> 00:17:04,180
He's lying right now. He's lying right now because it supports his evil agenda.

378
00:17:04,180 --> 00:17:10,540
I don't have an evil agenda. You do. You Dr. Evil looking motherfucker. I don't have an evil agenda.

379
00:17:10,540 --> 00:17:14,900

00:17:23,940 --> 00:17:26,640

390
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:45,320
See dude, you can't beat me.

391
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:46,160
Yes I can.

392
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:46,980
No you can't.

393
00:17:46,980 --> 00:17:47,820
I've already beaten you

394
00:17:47,820 --> 00:17:48,660
because you're shorter than me.

395
00:17:48,660 --> 00:17:49,480
I already beat you in the height race.

396
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:53,560
I'm not sure I'm way, I'm taller than you.

397
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:55,800
I'm probably an inch and a half taller than you.

398
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:57,160
No, we've already measured this.

399
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:58,200
We're the same height.

400
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:00,440
(laughing)

401
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:04,120
No.

402
00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:06,240
Yeah, well now you're shorter than me.

403
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:07,080
No.

404
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:07,900
Because you cut your hair.

405
00:18:07,900 --> 00:18:09,520
Can we talk about something else?

406
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:10,640
Yeah, let's talk about something else.

407
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:11,480
What do you want to talk about?

408
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:12,880
Let's talk about the NFL draft.

409
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:13,720
- No.

410
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:16,160
- Who was that guy that, what was his name?

411
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:18,400
Something Headley or something or Heidley.

412
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:21,600
The guy who was obsessed with fucking Big Bird.

413
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:22,440
Did you see him?

414
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:23,360
- Oh yeah, that was awesome.

415
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:24,320
- Dude, that guy rules.

416
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:25,360
- He had all the tweets like,

417
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:27,600
what if Big Bird did a drive-by?

418
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:29,640
- Yeah, the best one was,

419
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:31,680
what if Big Bird walked up to you and said,

420
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:33,360
"Hey, where's Sesame Street at?"

421
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:35,480
(laughing)

422
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:37,320
- I mean, what if, what would you do?

423
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:38,800
- Yeah, what would you guys do?

424
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:40,520
- Honestly, those are great questions.

425
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:41,360
- I would say--

426
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:44,200
Let's look them up and let's answer each one.

427
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:47,500
I would probably be pretty sarcastic, like Todd Berry.

428
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:50,360
And I'd be like, I don't know.

429
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:52,160
You look like Todd Berry because you're bald.

430
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:53,160
Shut up.

431
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:54,160
I would be like, I don't know.

432
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:55,160
Shut up.

433
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:56,160
I don't know.

434
00:18:56,160 --> 00:19:04,320
I would probably be like, I don't know, ask yourself.

435
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:08,200
I would pull out Google Maps and I would send him on a journey.

436
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:10,200
I'd put him on a wild big bird chase just for my own amusement.

437
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:13,200
I'd pull out my cannon and I'd say to him, "I would do..."

438
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:14,200
Yeah.

439
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:16,200
Pull out my bird cannon.

440
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:17,200
And shoot him with a sesame seed.

441
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:18,200
Load him in with a plunger.

442
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:20,200
Yeah, I'd be like, "Yeah, it's due north.

443
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:21,200
Hop in."

444
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:22,200
Yeah.

445
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:23,200
I'd say, "Hey."

446
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:30,920
It would suck though, 'cause he would obviously be followed by a fried chicken salesman who

447
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:33,200
wants to use his meat.

448
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:37,840
Yeah, he really is the golden goose of the fried chicken industry.

449
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:39,840
What kind of bird is he? Is he a chicken?

450
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:40,840
He's chicken.

451
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:42,840
Cheese, bird, poultry.

452
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:44,840
You should call him Big Chicken.

453
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:45,840
Yeah.

454
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:48,840
No, they already have a big chicken in Muppets.

455
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:49,840
Mm-hmm.

456
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:52,840
Well, Gonzo fucks chickens.

457
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:53,840
What?

458
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:55,840
Yeah, Gonzo fucks chickens.

459
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:57,840
I don't think you're allowed to say that, man.

460
00:19:57,840 --> 00:19:59,840
No, that's true.

461
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:00,840
No.

462
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:04,840
Gonzo has a wife that's a chicken, and her name's Camilla.

463
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:06,000
- Yeah, but we don't know what they do.

464
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:09,000
- Nobody fucks in Muppets, dude.

465
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:09,840
There's--

466
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:13,000
- Then explain Muppets Christmas Carol

467
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,400
when the boys are frogs and the girls are pigs.

468
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:16,880
- It's called love.

469
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:18,960
- Yeah. - It's called frog-pig love.

470
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:21,500
- Yeah, that's just nature.

471
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:24,040
- That's just what nature happens, dudes.

472
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:25,880
- That's just when nature calls, buddy.

473
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:28,040
- That's just what nature does.

474
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:29,680
- Yeah, so relax.

475
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:31,280
- Yeah, just relax for a second.

476
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:32,120
Lay back and let it happen.

477
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:32,960
- You're freaking out.

478
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:36,960
Patrick's on air freaking out about Muppets having sex dude.

479
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:37,960
I'm not freaking out.

480
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:38,960
I'm just saying.

481
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:39,960
I'm not freaking out.

482
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:41,960
You sound like OJ dude.

483
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:42,960
Right before he killed his wife.

484
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:44,960
That's probably what he sounded like.

485
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:46,960
He probably was like, "I'm not freaking out!"

486
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:50,960
And then he killed her so you should tell Dom to watch out.

487
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:53,960
I'm saying that if Big Bird's name was...

488
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:55,960
Dude you're off the rails right now dude.

489
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:59,960
If Big Bird's name was Big Chicken, Gonzo would try to fuck Big Bird.

490
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:00,960
They wouldn't.

491
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:01,960
It doesn't make sense.

492
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:05,320
doesn't make no name doesn't matter if you were named Pamela Anderson I

493
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:11,360
wouldn't try to that's not true well no cuz then it would specify what kind of

494
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:16,480
bird he is not if it's just his name but we are you know what is it already

495
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:22,440
chicken no matter what he's not a chicken he's a big bird he's a single

496
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:27,920
he's a one-of-a-kind he's one of God's limited edition he's a special he's a

497
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:37,920
legendary. He's a very special bird. He's a legendary drop. Can you buy a

498
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:44,480
Big Bird outfit or is that like... I mean you can't. It's illegal. You can but it's like off.

499
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:48,520
It's illegal to impersonate Big Bird because you could go around giving

500
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:51,920
advice to people and they would take it because they think you're Big Bird.

501
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:55,400
I think you probably would get in trouble if you if you made a perfectly

502
00:21:55,400 --> 00:22:00,780
accurate Big Bird. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That's why you gotta make the legs like green or

503
00:22:00,780 --> 00:22:07,400
something. Yeah. Or add a beauty mark. Yeah. Or a bikini. Add a penis. Put a bikini on it.

504
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:13,640
Big Bird with big jugs. Yeah. Big Bird, where'd you get those big

505
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:19,320
humongous jugs? Nowhere. I don't know. I've always had them. That's what he says.

506
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:25,040
Yeah. I've always had them. I just got my feathers cut. Yeah. They CGI them out for

507
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:30,560
show but I've always had humongous juicy tits that are you can't even hide them in a shirt dude just

508
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:35,280
big succulent big burp I would love I would love to do a wet t-shirt contest with all the

00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:40,640
muppets and see who comes out on top I got a strong feeling miss piggy yeah yeah miss piggy had the

510
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:49,280

511
00:22:49,280 --> 00:23:00,040
wet yeah yeah you're right hands the wet dirty hands in them for they make them

512
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:05,360
out of dog hair so yeah they make them out of dead dog skin yeah yeah that's

513
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:10,800
what I'm like the meat is still attached on the inside instead of telling my kids

514
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:16,600
that we brought the family dog to a farm I'm gonna say we shipped him off to Jim

515
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:21,560
henson and he turned him into a muppet yeah so don't worry he's dead you don't have to tell your

516
00:23:21,560 --> 00:23:28,280
kids that well they turned jim henson to a muppet too and they did they scalped him yeah yeah they

517
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:37,480
just turned his scalp it's a muppet but just with a human scalp like the scalp is the mouth

518
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:43,320
yeah kind of pull it with the string so it's like doing that yeah and they use jim henson's dick as

519
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:49,560
the nose. That's the only part that's used. Did you know Gonzo's nose was modeled after

520
00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:54,680
Jim Henson's penis? The puppeteer had to put the penis into the puppet in the nose to control

521
00:23:54,680 --> 00:24:02,720
the nose. To move it, yeah. Like that jackass thing where he puts his penis in the puppet

522
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:10,080
and the snake bites it. Or is it a tarantula? It's a scorpion. No, no, no, it's a snake.

523
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:11,080
Is it?

524
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:14,920
Because the scorpion was when he's upside down his chin is like.

525
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:17,160
Oh yeah, when he's doing the pops thing.

526
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:18,160
Yeah.

527
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:19,160
Yeah.

528
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:22,640
Oh yeah, that was fucking Corn Pop's mascot for a long time.

529
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:23,640
That was big for a while.

530
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:25,600
Doing the upside down chin thing.

531
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:26,600
Fuck.

532
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:28,280
They didn't even come up with that.

533
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:29,960
You guys are talking about Corn Pop?

534
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:32,720
We're talking about Corn Pop with a chain.

535
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:33,880
Yeah, yeah.

536
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:34,880
From TV.

537
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:36,520
From TV.

538
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:41,480
He used to touch Joe Biden's blonde leg hair.

539
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:43,480
And he used to have a mask on?

540
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:48,000
They used to put their heads upside down and then pretend that it was a child.

541
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:52,640
And then they would put googly eyes on their chin and then sit upside down and then lick

542
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:53,640
Joe Biden's leg hair.

543
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:54,640
That's foul.

544
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:55,640
That's just foul, dude.

545
00:24:55,640 --> 00:24:57,560
I'm not going to say anything.

546
00:24:57,560 --> 00:25:01,400
I'm going to not say anything just in case Weezer's lawyers get mad at me.

547
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:05,280
It's a bad move.

548
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:07,280
That was in foul taste, Patrick.

549
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:09,280
That was downright vile to hear from you.

550
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:11,280
Coming out of your little pink mouth.

551
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:13,280
That was disgusting.

552
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:15,280
(Laughter)

553
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:17,280
Oh my god, no, dude.

554
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:19,280
What?

555
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:21,280
I just grabbed a stress ball

556
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:23,280
from... I'm recording

557
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:25,280
in my little brother's room, so I'm at this like

558
00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:27,280
very tiny table.

559
00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:29,280
It's like a stress ball with beads

560
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:31,280
in it, and I guess he poked a hole

561
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:33,280
in it because I squeezed it, and all the

562
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:40,280
paint is all over me now. Damn. This fucking sucks. Oh fuck. What color is it? It's white

563
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:45,280
dude. Oh yeah. I know what he's been doing. You know what he's been using that hole for.

564
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:50,280
Uh huh. Come on man. That's what he got in it. That's what he got in it. Oh. What the?

565
00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:56,280
That's what he put in the stress ball. What in the? He's a kid. This is my kid brother

566
00:25:56,280 --> 00:26:02,280
man. What is Patrick? This is your worst episode yet dude. Patrick you gotta shut your silky

567
00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:10,280
little lips. Yeah, before I fuck him. Stop saying my mouth is nice. You have a nice mouth,

568
00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:15,800
dude. There's nothing weird about it. I would love to see Patrick without teeth. Just see

569
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:19,800
what it looks like. We can make that happen. Probably. Get us to 10,000 a month on the

570
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:25,760
Patreon and we'll remove all of Patrick's teeth. 10,000 a month, I will get one of my

571
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:31,360
teeth removed. You should get um... Can we agree to that? You'll get one tooth pulled.

572
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:37,440
If we get 2,000 a month, I will go to the dentist.

573
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:40,520
If we get 10,000 a month, you will get a tooth pulled.

574
00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:41,520
Mm-hmm.

575
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:42,520
Okay, and if we get a month--

576
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:46,200
I'll go every day, I'll spray this tooth with germs.

577
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:49,560
Okay, what kind of germs?

578
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:54,360
At 20,000 a month, Pat's gonna get plastic surgery, so he's gonna be one of those alligator

579
00:26:54,360 --> 00:26:59,200
toys where you push down the tooth, and you push it down into his gums.

580
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:01,200
And he bites every time, though.

581
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:02,200
Yeah.

582
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:05,240
But it's okay, because every time you push a tooth down, it's a little gummier and a

583
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:06,240
little sweeter.

584
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:07,240
That's true.

585
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:08,240
It's fine.

586
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:10,240
It's Patrick's sweet, gummy mouth.

587
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:12,600
That's such a terrifying game, dude.

588
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:13,880
What, the alligator game?

589
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:14,880
Yeah, dude.

590
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:15,880
Scary if you're a bitch.

591
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:16,880
No.

592
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:17,880
No, I have one that's Godzilla.

593
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:20,200
The problem is, you guys never saw alligators.

594
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:21,720
We had alligators in my backyard.

595
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:23,080
I've seen one in a book.

596
00:27:23,080 --> 00:27:24,080
I saw alligators.

597
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:25,080
They brought alligators to my school.

598
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:26,080
Alligators in my backyard, dude.

599
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:27,080
What?

600
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:28,080
They brought baby-

601
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:29,080
Who's we?

602
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:30,080
Or they?

603
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:31,080
Who's we?

604
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:31,920
- Who's us?

605
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:33,520
(laughing)

606
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:35,680
- The guys, the alligator guys.

607
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:36,520
- Who are the alligator guys?

608
00:27:36,520 --> 00:27:37,440
- Do they never bring an animal?

609
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:39,360
I guess you were homeschooled, whatever.

610
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:41,480
Pat, did they ever bring animals to your school?

611
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:42,320
Do like animal presentations?

612
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:44,480
- Yeah, they brought owls to our school once.

613
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:46,120
- There was a guy who would bring reptiles

614
00:27:46,120 --> 00:27:47,360
and he brought a baby alligator.

615
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:49,440
- I never saw reptiles.

616
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:51,240
- You never seen a reptile before?

617
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:53,040
- I've seen reptiles. - Brother, just look down.

618
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:55,320
- They didn't bring reptiles to my school,

619
00:27:55,320 --> 00:27:56,640
they brought owls, but--

620
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:58,280
- Owls are reptiles.

621
00:27:58,280 --> 00:28:00,000
- My neighbor had a pet-- - Owls are reptiles.

622
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:04,560
neighbor had a pet alligator. Is Caleb frozen or just sitting like that? I just

623
00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:10,120
I like sitting like that. I've developed a time ability. Yeah. Really? Yeah. Ready?

624
00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:16,800
Watch this. Yeah. For the listeners, Caleb's sitting still. Mm-hmm. He's

625
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:21,640
learned the skill of sitting still. His eyes merge. He's sitting still because he

626
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:26,640
he looks like if you crossed Mr. Clean with a chimp.

627
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:36,640
He looks like if the Tang mascot and Mr. Clean got together and had a kid.

628
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:37,640
Yeah.

629
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:40,640
He's American History X.

630
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:44,640
He's American History XXL.

631
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:47,640
Dunstan checks into American History X.

632
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:48,640
Mm-hmm.

633
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:49,640
Yeah.

634
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:51,640
Alright, stop sitting still, Caleb.

635
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:54,280
American history 2x chromosomes.

636
00:28:54,280 --> 00:28:56,280
[laughter]

637
00:28:56,280 --> 00:28:58,280
And I'm a girl.

638
00:28:58,280 --> 00:29:00,280
That's pretty...

639
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:02,280
That's just Farouk's character in that movie.

640
00:29:02,280 --> 00:29:04,280
[laughter]

641
00:29:04,280 --> 00:29:06,280
Exactly.

642
00:29:06,280 --> 00:29:08,280
Dude, I wish you were still fat, because I could say

643
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:10,280
American history double XL.

644
00:29:10,280 --> 00:29:12,280
I fucking said that!

645
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:14,280
It didn't make any sense though, because I'm not fat anymore.

646
00:29:14,280 --> 00:29:16,280
You wanna see a really funny

647
00:29:16,280 --> 00:29:18,280
fat Caleb picture?

648
00:29:18,280 --> 00:29:25,280
one of you is my cup is it the one of you right now? You keep your pictures in a cup? No,

649
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:36,760
my in-laws got me and Jana a cup with a picture of us on it a couple years ago. Look at him

650
00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:44,480
dude. Oh my god. You're very fat. Wow. Yeah. Jana looks pretty stupid too. Or do you put

651
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:58,520

652
00:29:58,520 --> 00:30:03,960
photo damn yeah man it was awesome dude I miss being fat no it's awesome dude

653
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:09,200
who's sick yeah he's like I don't have to run the mile anymore exactly yeah you

654
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:17,040
get to walk it because if they have you run, recess will be over three times.

655
00:30:17,040 --> 00:30:25,660
I fuckin, in the eighth grade, I, uh, me and my friend tried to like see how long we could

656
00:30:25,660 --> 00:30:28,680
do the mile so we like walked super slow.

657
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:33,680
I think at one point we just like sat down but like we got like, we did the mile in like

658
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:35,840
an hour.

659
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:37,200
That's great pace man.

660
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:40,400
And the gym teacher was so fucking mad at me.

661
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:41,400
Of course.

662
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:42,400
Like, she...

663
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:43,400
Yeah, the class...

664
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:47,120
I feel like a mile and an hour is impressive.

665
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:50,040
It's impressive that you could stretch a mile that long.

666
00:30:50,040 --> 00:30:51,040
Yeah.

667
00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:56,440
The class is only 30 minutes long and everyone was just waiting for you for half an hour.

668
00:30:56,440 --> 00:30:59,080
No, I think it was like an hour long.

669
00:30:59,080 --> 00:31:00,080
I don't remember.

670
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:05,560
That, um, there's that King of the Hill episode where Bobby, Bobby has to run the mile and

671
00:31:05,560 --> 00:31:08,080
And just every time he has to run out like every week or something and every time he

672
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:12,440
just goes to this restaurant and like he's wearing like a it has a dress code.

673
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:16,360
He's wearing like a suit under his gym shorts and he like just goes and hangs out with like

674
00:31:16,360 --> 00:31:18,360
old ladies and eats appetizers.

675
00:31:18,360 --> 00:31:23,240
I would that'd be so cool to just go to like McDonald's during the mile.

676
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:28,640
Oh yeah I wish the the closest thing to my school growing up was the skate park.

677
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:32,200
So the only thing like I couldn't go like skating during the mile.

678
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:33,600
Yeah I would go.

679
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:35,560
- I got back three hours later.

680
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:39,720
- Yeah, I went, I think I've said it before,

681
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:42,880
but I like set up my schedule sophomore year

682
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:47,880
of high school where I like took lunch and then a study.

683
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:51,440
So then I would leave during lunch at like 12

684
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:54,840
in the afternoon, like 1230, I would leave the building

685
00:31:54,840 --> 00:31:57,480
and then stay there till like five.

686
00:31:57,480 --> 00:31:58,320
- Yeah.

687
00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:02,240
Yeah, that was the dream to have enough free periods

688
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:21,960

692
00:32:38,940 --> 00:32:43,600
wouldn't tell you in school. Yeah they're afraid to tell you. Like how to do a nose grind. Yeah.

693
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:47,580
Yeah exactly the the imperialist school system wouldn't tell you how to do a nose

694
00:32:47,580 --> 00:32:54,060
grind yeah I you could I capitalism with the when I was in high school I got I got

00:32:54,060 --> 00:33:00,220
pretty good like I got not like good good but I got like okay junior year and

696
00:33:00,220 --> 00:33:05,420
then senior year I fucked up my ankle and then I was out for like a couple of

697
00:33:05,420 --> 00:33:08,820
like coincided like I fucked up my ankle and then the winter happened but then

698
00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:12,940
like it hasn't been the same since like sometimes I like didn't you say like

699
00:33:12,940 --> 00:33:15,740
Your ankle hurts when it's cold?

700
00:33:15,740 --> 00:33:17,740
Sometimes, yeah.

701
00:33:17,740 --> 00:33:19,740
That's such an old man problem.

702
00:33:19,740 --> 00:33:27,740
There was one day, I went to the skate park before Corona, when it was like 60 in February,

703
00:33:27,740 --> 00:33:33,740
and I was skating and then just out of nowhere, my ankle, I just couldn't walk on it.

704
00:33:33,740 --> 00:33:37,740
So I had to limp to the bus and then go home.

705
00:33:37,740 --> 00:33:42,740
Hey, would you guys rather hunt or heal?

706
00:33:42,740 --> 00:33:44,740
Would I rather hunt?

707
00:33:44,740 --> 00:33:45,740
That's a really good question.

708
00:33:45,740 --> 00:33:48,740
That's one of the best questions I've had this week.

709
00:33:48,740 --> 00:33:49,740
Would you rather hunt or heal?

710
00:33:49,740 --> 00:33:51,740
Well, there's 27 more, so...

711
00:33:51,740 --> 00:33:53,740
I would rather hunt.

712
00:33:53,740 --> 00:33:54,740
Hunt?

713
00:33:54,740 --> 00:33:55,740
Yeah.

714
00:33:55,740 --> 00:33:57,740
Okay, what's your preference?

715
00:33:57,740 --> 00:33:59,740
Plot or explore?

716
00:33:59,740 --> 00:34:01,740
I'm a bit of a plotter.

717
00:34:01,740 --> 00:34:02,740
All right.

718
00:34:02,740 --> 00:34:03,740
I'll say it.

719
00:34:03,740 --> 00:34:04,740
I like to sit back.

720
00:34:04,740 --> 00:34:09,760
I like to have a big map in front of me and making X's.

721
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:11,980
This is the Ilvermorny Sorting Quiz.

722
00:34:11,980 --> 00:34:13,620
These questions are crazy.

723
00:34:13,620 --> 00:34:19,140
Do you prefer to remember or experience?

724
00:34:19,140 --> 00:34:22,220
Definitely experience.

725
00:34:22,220 --> 00:34:27,140
You can rescue a baby or the only bottle of a potion that could save 1000 lives.

726
00:34:27,140 --> 00:34:28,140
Which one?

727
00:34:28,140 --> 00:34:32,900
But the bottle only might save 1000 lives.

728
00:34:32,900 --> 00:34:33,900
The potion.

729
00:34:33,900 --> 00:34:34,900
So?

730
00:34:34,900 --> 00:34:35,900
Get the potion.

731
00:34:35,900 --> 00:34:36,900
Why?

732
00:34:36,900 --> 00:34:38,440
Well, Caleb's answered all the quiz.

733
00:34:38,440 --> 00:34:39,440
This is Caleb's quiz.

734
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:40,440
Is it a mite?

735
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:41,440
Wait, the baby.

736
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:42,440
I don't know.

737
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:43,440
The baby?

738
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:46,940
If it's a mite, like, I mean, I don't know, my fucking, my boot might say, "Fixing lives."

739
00:34:46,940 --> 00:34:48,900
Which is the better motto?

740
00:34:48,900 --> 00:34:55,040
It is nobler to be deceived than to be mistrustful, or friends should not determine or demand blind

741
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:59,300
faith.

742
00:34:59,300 --> 00:35:00,300
Which one's better, man?

743
00:35:00,300 --> 00:35:01,300
Come on.

744
00:35:01,300 --> 00:35:02,300
I'm going to say...

745
00:35:02,300 --> 00:35:05,260
Which one's closer to Live Free Die Hard?

746
00:35:05,260 --> 00:35:09,460
The Die Hard movie.

747
00:35:09,460 --> 00:35:10,300
The title of that.

748
00:35:10,300 --> 00:35:11,860
Probably the second one.

749
00:35:11,860 --> 00:35:13,580
Yeah, go for that.

750
00:35:13,580 --> 00:35:16,860
- No curse can work without the victim's secret consent.

751
00:35:16,860 --> 00:35:18,200
True or false?

752
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:20,500
- False.

753
00:35:20,500 --> 00:35:21,500
(laughing)

754
00:35:21,500 --> 00:35:22,660
Definitely false.

755
00:35:22,660 --> 00:35:24,060
- What a crazy question.

756
00:35:24,060 --> 00:35:25,220
- Definitely false.

757
00:35:25,220 --> 00:35:27,740
- I most value freedom, individuality,

758
00:35:27,740 --> 00:35:29,580
service, or ambition.

759
00:35:29,580 --> 00:35:30,860
- Money.

760
00:35:30,860 --> 00:35:33,000
That sounds like service to me.

761
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,920
No, that's ambition.

762
00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:36,020
Ambition?

763
00:35:36,020 --> 00:35:37,120
Yeah.

764
00:35:37,120 --> 00:35:42,000
I would most like to discover a powerful magical creature loyal only to me, an all magical

765
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:46,840
city hidden from the nomad's world, a spell more powerful than any other, or a magical

766
00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:49,320
plant that will cure any illness.

767
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:54,000
A magical plant that will cure any illness, because I got a pretty good idea what that

768
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:55,000
is, baby.

769
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:56,000
Digunja!

770
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,760
Fasten it to achieve the dollar fine side!

771
00:35:58,760 --> 00:36:03,560
I challenge authority other people's patience. Oops. I picked one by accident. All right,

772
00:36:03,560 --> 00:36:09,080
you challenge. No, my greatest weaknesses. Nobody's business, but mine. What makes me

773
00:36:09,080 --> 00:36:16,680
me the source of my greatest strength or something I must change. What makes me me baby? Yeah,

774
00:36:16,680 --> 00:36:24,760
your baldness. My bat, my baldness. If I could, I would never feel pain, fear, regret or shame.

775
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:25,760
Shame.

776
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:34,680
A soulmate is, out there somewhere, an illusion, a psychic twin, or strong where I'm weak, weak

777
00:36:34,680 --> 00:36:35,680
where I'm strong.

778
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:38,660
Easily psychic twin, no question.

779
00:36:38,660 --> 00:36:46,320
My beliefs are hard one, who I am, constantly evolving, or few but strong.

780
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:49,140
Hard one.

781
00:36:49,140 --> 00:36:51,960
This is taking so long, I'm just gonna pick random ones.

782
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:53,800
No, dude, I wanna know what I am, dude.

783
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:55,800
We have to figure out Caleb's...

784
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:57,300
Fine, my best idea is...

785
00:36:57,300 --> 00:36:59,300
See, men hate astrology.

786
00:36:59,300 --> 00:37:04,300
My best idea is "get me in trouble, aren't appreciated enough, have changed my life, or have gone to waste."

787
00:37:04,300 --> 00:37:05,800
They get me in trouble.

788
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:06,800
That's true.

789
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:09,800
I had a shirt that said that in elementary school.

790
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:10,800
Why?

791
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:12,300
My best idea is "get me in trouble."

792
00:37:12,300 --> 00:37:17,800
Why? Why not? Because I want to. Stupid question, or we may never know.

793
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:19,800
We may never know, baby.

794
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:26,960
Yeah, all I need is an opportunity, a little more time, some help already inside me.

795
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:27,960
Already inside me?

796
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:28,960
You are already inside me.

797
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:30,520
It's all my shits and my piss.

798
00:37:30,520 --> 00:37:32,240
I often think, why did I do that?

799
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:33,240
Why can't I do that?

800
00:37:33,240 --> 00:37:39,480
I wish I had done that, or I wonder whether I should do that.

801
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:40,480
Hurry up, come on.

802
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:41,480
Which one?

803
00:37:41,480 --> 00:37:43,840
Yeah, WTF BBQ, the first one.

804
00:37:43,840 --> 00:37:45,240
Alright.

805
00:37:45,240 --> 00:37:46,960
What would you exchange for your heart's desire?

806
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:47,960
Anything.

807
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:48,960
How many fucking questions is this?

808
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:53,080
I'm just gonna pick the first one for all the rest of them.

809
00:37:53,080 --> 00:37:57,120
That's fine, that's what I was planning on.

810
00:37:57,120 --> 00:38:02,120
My magic is inborn.

811
00:38:02,120 --> 00:38:04,120
What would you least like to lose?

812
00:38:04,120 --> 00:38:05,760
Reputation.

813
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:06,760
Nobody's judgment.

814
00:38:06,760 --> 00:38:10,360
A jinx that meant nothing was funny.

815
00:38:10,360 --> 00:38:13,560
The power to change one day in your future.

816
00:38:13,560 --> 00:38:15,520
Imprisoned alone in a silent dungeon.

817
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:22,400
a shadow of a doubt if you come with me not for many years.

818
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:25,840
Alright it's calculating results Caleb.

819
00:38:25,840 --> 00:38:26,840
You are Thunderbird.

820
00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:29,840
Yeah you fucking bet I am.

821
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:34,680
Named by Chadwick Boot after his favorite magical beast.

822
00:38:34,680 --> 00:38:37,920
Chadwick Boot sounds like an alt-light kind of guy.

823
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:38,920
Yeah.

824
00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:42,920
Oh and Pat I have a quiz for you too.

825
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:44,920
"Are you normal or weird?"

826
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:45,920
Okay.

827
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:47,920
I think I know the answer to this one, but we don't know.

828
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:48,920
Choose a flavor of drink.

829
00:38:48,920 --> 00:38:49,920
Choose a flavor of drink.

830
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:51,920
Peach or strawberry?

831
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:53,920
Uh, peach.

832
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:56,920
Um, choose a marsupial.

833
00:38:56,920 --> 00:38:58,920
Sugar glider or wombat?

834
00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:01,920
Oh, sugar glider. I've seen those in person.

835
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:03,920
Choose an alternative baby name.

836
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:05,920
Baltazar or Oakland?

837
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:09,920
What the fuck?

838
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:13,120
Probably Balduzar because it's not the name of a place.

839
00:39:13,120 --> 00:39:16,960
Who would you be in Dungeons and Dragons? Dungeons and what?

840
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:21,920
Or the Dungeon Master? Dungeons and

841
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:26,200
the Master. That's... which... what do I pick? Click both.

842
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:29,800
Click both of them. Choose a traditional candy.

843
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:35,160
Marzipan or peanut butter toffee? Marzipan.

844
00:39:35,160 --> 00:39:38,200
There's only two... The fuck is marzipan?

845
00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:42,360
Choose a color. It's like a almond thing. Rocky Horror Picture Show or The Room?

846
00:39:42,360 --> 00:39:44,600
Ugh.

847
00:39:44,600 --> 00:39:49,520
Dude, you don't- you know the answer here. You know what you need. Yeah, it's probably Rocky Horror.

848
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:53,080
And it's probably Rocky Horror. Halloween or Thanksgiving?

849
00:39:53,080 --> 00:40:00,040
Thanksgiving. That's a lie. Yeah, that's ridiculous. You have it- your bathroom is blood themed.

850
00:40:00,040 --> 00:40:06,840
Crazy by- No, it's psycho themed, you idiot. You stupid, fucking, bald idiot. Crazy by Narls Barkley

851
00:40:06,840 --> 00:40:11,800
or I believe in a thing called love by the dark crazy by Narls Barkley is a better song and

852

855
00:40:35,480 --> 00:40:38,400
'cause a bird snatched up your toupee.

856
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:39,240
- No.

857
00:40:39,240 --> 00:40:40,080
- Yeah.

858
00:40:40,080 --> 00:40:42,200
- No, I got Thunderbird, 'cause I'm like a thunder,

859
00:40:42,200 --> 00:40:43,880
'cause I'm like a thunder cat that can fly.

860
00:40:43,880 --> 00:40:46,000
- A huge bird, a huge bird flew in and took away all your hair.

861
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:47,560
- No, it's like a car, dude.

862
00:40:47,560 --> 00:40:48,880
It's literally a muscle car.

863
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:49,720
- You're a bird, 'cause you lay eggs.

864
00:40:49,720 --> 00:40:50,540
- But you wouldn't know anything about that

865
00:40:50,540 --> 00:40:51,380
'cause you're a girl.

866
00:40:51,380 --> 00:40:52,200
- Caleb lays eggs.

867
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:55,080
- You drove a muscle car and you put the top down

868
00:40:55,080 --> 00:40:58,320
and all of your hair flew out the window.

869
00:40:58,320 --> 00:41:01,120
- That's fine, yeah, and then you were in the car behind me

870
00:41:01,120 --> 00:41:03,520
and you thought that it was spaghetti and you ate all of it.

871
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:04,640
- No, I didn't think it was spaghetti.

872
00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:05,640
No you did.

873
00:41:05,640 --> 00:41:06,640
I thought it was hair.

874
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:07,640
And you ate all of it.

875
00:41:07,640 --> 00:41:09,600
You thought it was hair and then you ate all of it anyway.

876
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:10,600
You ate all of it.

877
00:41:10,600 --> 00:41:11,600
Yeah.

878
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:13,680
Because you were like, "Oh, that's something I can eat."

879
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:14,680
No, I would probably...

880
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:16,680
Because you were about to turn on your steering wheel and eat that.

881
00:41:16,680 --> 00:41:20,160
No, I took all the hair and I turned it into a wig for women with cancer.

882
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:21,160
No, you didn't.

883
00:41:21,160 --> 00:41:22,960
You don't work at Locks of Love and you never have.

884
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:24,440
I work at Locks of Love.

885
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:25,440
No, you don't.

886
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:26,440
By the way, that is what I...

887
00:41:26,440 --> 00:41:27,440
I brought it to my high school.

888
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:28,440
That is what I donated my hair to.

889
00:41:28,440 --> 00:41:30,400
My high school had the biggest Locks of Love...

890
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:33,080
I donate all my hair to Locks of Love and now there's some woman...

891
00:41:33,080 --> 00:41:35,960
walking around with some super fucked up hair.

892
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:39,320
Patrick, you uh, you work for Lotkas of Love,

893
00:41:39,320 --> 00:41:40,920
'cause you like food and you're Jewish.

894
00:41:40,920 --> 00:41:41,400
Yeah.

895
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:43,240
Yeah, you work for lots of-

896
00:41:43,240 --> 00:41:44,920
you work for lots of food,

897
00:41:44,920 --> 00:41:47,560
which is a charity where you just eat.

898
00:41:47,560 --> 00:41:49,240
And that's it.

899
00:41:49,240 --> 00:41:51,400
Caleb, you work for Nazi Love?

900
00:41:51,400 --> 00:41:53,560
Not- he can't even say it.

901
00:41:53,560 --> 00:41:54,200
He's afraid.

902
00:41:54,200 --> 00:41:55,160
It's so messed up.

903
00:41:55,160 --> 00:41:57,720
He's afraid of the power of those words.

904
00:41:57,720 --> 00:41:58,680
Mm-hmm.

905
00:41:58,680 --> 00:41:58,920
Yeah.

906
00:41:58,920 --> 00:42:02,200
I don't wanna- I don't wanna say you're a Nazi.

907
00:42:02,200 --> 00:42:02,440
Why?

908
00:42:02,440 --> 00:42:09,520
I don't know I feel like that's too mean. No with the way that you look if someone

909
00:42:09,520 --> 00:42:15,400
tried to accuse you. Oh dude it would be over yeah. No I look like a huge Nazi yeah.

910
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:19,600
And you're from North Carolina, you're from the south. We can't even make jokes about

911
00:42:19,600 --> 00:42:24,400
that because it's like too far. It's too far. It's too soon.

912
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:28,520
It sucks because New Hampshire is so much more racist than North Carolina.

913
00:42:28,520 --> 00:42:29,680
Oh, absolutely.

914
00:42:29,680 --> 00:42:34,040
And also, isn't, aren't like nowadays

915
00:42:34,040 --> 00:42:36,880
the like real like skinhead Nazis are mostly--

916
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:40,860
Isn't, yeah, one of the people from the Vice documentary

917
00:42:40,860 --> 00:42:43,320
was from Keen and then they like,

918
00:42:43,320 --> 00:42:46,840
they sat outside of his house and they bullied him.

919
00:42:46,840 --> 00:42:48,840
They, Vice bullied a Nazi?

920
00:42:48,840 --> 00:42:49,680
No, the people--

921
00:42:49,680 --> 00:42:51,840
Okay, I like Vice now.

922
00:42:51,840 --> 00:42:52,680
Yeah, no, I don't like--

923
00:42:52,680 --> 00:42:54,760
Okay, Vice is officially awesome, dude.

924
00:42:54,760 --> 00:42:56,720
No, people in Keen bullied the guy.

925
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,240
I remember watching, I used to watch like the Vice,

926
00:43:00,240 --> 00:43:02,840
like Chirac documentary series.

927
00:43:02,840 --> 00:43:04,120
- Yeah. - Have you guys seen that?

928
00:43:04,120 --> 00:43:07,200
- No, the only thing I watched from Vice in high school

929
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:08,800
was Epically Latered.

930
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:13,040
- The Chirac, they basically send just like,

931
00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:15,520
they send like the nerdiest little bitch

932
00:43:15,520 --> 00:43:18,840
into like the South Side of Chicago,

933
00:43:18,840 --> 00:43:20,440
like drill scene. - It's Nerd in the Hood, dude.

934
00:43:20,440 --> 00:43:23,840
- It is Nerd in the Hood a million percent, dude.

935
00:43:23,840 --> 00:43:26,040
And he's just walking around and he's like,

936
00:43:26,040 --> 00:43:28,040
So are these firearms purchased legally?

937
00:43:28,040 --> 00:43:30,040
[laughter]

938
00:43:30,040 --> 00:43:32,040
It's fucking awesome, dude.

939
00:43:32,040 --> 00:43:34,040
It's...

940
00:43:34,040 --> 00:43:36,040
It's good shit. I love 'em.

941
00:43:36,040 --> 00:43:38,040
Ah, man.

942
00:43:38,040 --> 00:43:40,040
I gotta fuckin'...

943
00:43:40,040 --> 00:43:42,040
My leg hurts.

944
00:43:42,040 --> 00:43:44,040
My leg hurt.

945
00:43:44,040 --> 00:43:46,040
You should get a wooden leg.

946
00:43:46,040 --> 00:43:48,040
You should get two wooden legs.

947
00:43:48,040 --> 00:43:50,040
If we get to $15,000, he'll take all his teeth out

948
00:43:50,040 --> 00:43:52,040
and get a wooden leg.

949
00:43:52,040 --> 00:43:54,040
I've been playing Sea of Thieves

950
00:43:54,040 --> 00:43:55,920
We're placing them with wood.

951
00:43:55,920 --> 00:43:56,920
That pirate game.

952
00:43:56,920 --> 00:43:57,920
Yeah.

953
00:43:57,920 --> 00:44:04,920
I've basically just been gaming all day for the last like three weeks.

954
00:44:04,920 --> 00:44:06,880
Don't open CSGO or TF2.

955
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:07,880
I already did.

956
00:44:07,880 --> 00:44:09,560
You're so stupid dude.

957
00:44:09,560 --> 00:44:13,720
I didn't know about it until Cameron put it in the gaming discord.

958
00:44:13,720 --> 00:44:15,800
You guys are lucky.

959
00:44:15,800 --> 00:44:16,800
Did I-

960
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:17,800
Should I uninstall it?

961
00:44:17,800 --> 00:44:19,160
No, just don't launch it.

962
00:44:19,160 --> 00:44:20,320
I mean it's too late now.

963
00:44:20,320 --> 00:44:22,520
If anything was going to happen, it's already happened.

964
00:44:22,520 --> 00:44:25,280
Yeah, I think we were on like the casual.

965
00:44:25,280 --> 00:44:26,240
I mean, that doesn't matter.

966
00:44:26,240 --> 00:44:28,800
It's the thing itself.

967
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:30,440
So like, if you--

968
00:44:30,440 --> 00:44:32,880
I think I'm, I think I, I think,

969
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:34,480
I think you're lying.

970
00:44:34,480 --> 00:44:35,480
Yeah, I'm lying.

971
00:44:35,480 --> 00:44:37,880
No, the source code, the source code got leaked.

972
00:44:37,880 --> 00:44:39,480
It's funny that it's the source code.

973
00:44:39,480 --> 00:44:40,320
Yeah, more like the horse--

974
00:44:40,320 --> 00:44:41,140
You remember that movie?

975
00:44:41,140 --> 00:44:41,980
More like the horse code,

976
00:44:41,980 --> 00:44:44,040
'cause I say, "Nay, thank you to that."

977
00:44:44,040 --> 00:44:45,280
(laughing)

978
00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:47,280
I'm working on our improv theater.

979
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:49,680
I figured we should sprinkle a few little stuff like that.

980
00:44:49,680 --> 00:44:50,520
Some more puns in improv.

981
00:44:50,520 --> 00:44:52,800
Let's do a scene, let's do a scene, okay.

982
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:53,300
I'm a-

983
00:44:53,300 --> 00:44:53,800
Okay.

984
00:44:53,800 --> 00:44:54,600
What about improv but game?

985
00:44:54,600 --> 00:44:57,920
Let's do a scene where we're all inside of Counter-Strike.

986
00:44:57,920 --> 00:44:59,180
Okay.

987
00:44:59,180 --> 00:45:01,320
Terrorists win.

988
00:45:01,320 --> 00:45:02,440
Okay, scene.

989
00:45:02,440 --> 00:45:03,460
Perfect.

990
00:45:03,460 --> 00:45:03,960
[Laughter]

991
00:45:03,960 --> 00:45:04,800
Perfect scene.

992
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:05,300
Okay.

993
00:45:05,300 --> 00:45:05,800
Yeah, that's-

994
00:45:05,800 --> 00:45:06,300
Now let's do a scene.

995
00:45:06,300 --> 00:45:07,600
That is how the game ends, so...

996
00:45:07,600 --> 00:45:10,320
So, Cam, you seem to be working on this horse character.

997
00:45:10,320 --> 00:45:11,560
Let's explore that more.

998
00:45:11,560 --> 00:45:12,060
Alright.

999
00:45:12,060 --> 00:45:12,980
Okay.

1000
00:45:12,980 --> 00:45:13,480
Yeah.

1001
00:45:13,480 --> 00:45:16,120
So we're gonna do an exercise right now, where you're a horse, right?

1002
00:45:16,120 --> 00:45:18,920
No, I'm a guy who, I like, I make j- I'm a horse.

1003
00:45:18,920 --> 00:45:20,840
You're a guy who thinks he's a horse.

1004
00:45:20,840 --> 00:45:21,680
Okay.

1005
00:45:21,680 --> 00:45:22,840
And you're on a game show.

1006
00:45:22,840 --> 00:45:23,680
Oh, shit.

1007
00:45:23,680 --> 00:45:25,000
And that game show is hosted.

1008
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:26,800
And the game show is called Guess That Horse.

1009
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:27,640
All right, let's do it.

1010
00:45:27,640 --> 00:45:28,480
Guess That Guy's Nationality.

1011
00:45:28,480 --> 00:45:29,400
Okay, you take it and start it.

1012
00:45:29,400 --> 00:45:30,240
Let's go.

1013
00:45:30,240 --> 00:45:31,060
Start the scene.

1014
00:45:31,060 --> 00:45:32,840
Okay, all right.

1015
00:45:32,840 --> 00:45:34,680

1016
00:45:34,680 --> 00:45:36,160
It's me, I'm the horse.

1017
00:45:36,160 --> 00:45:38,800
Welcome back to Guess That Guy's Nationality.

1018
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:40,320
Okay, no, we changed the game show

1019
00:45:40,320 --> 00:45:41,560
because you won too fast.

1020
00:45:41,560 --> 00:45:44,920
Welcome back to Guess That Guy's Nationality.

1021
00:45:44,920 --> 00:45:48,200
Here's a picture of the guy who,

1022
00:45:48,200 --> 00:45:53,360
that one guy who played that actor who go was in iron man three and

1031
00:46:17,240 --> 00:46:19,240
I was right, that's the correct answer.

1032
00:46:19,240 --> 00:46:21,240
He's not a horse, dude, he's a guy.

1033
00:46:21,240 --> 00:46:23,240
What are you talking-- his name is Ben Hoofsley.

1034
00:46:23,240 --> 00:46:25,240
[laughter]

1035
00:46:25,240 --> 00:46:27,240
Right?

1036
00:46:27,240 --> 00:46:29,240
Yeah, you're right.

1037
00:46:29,240 --> 00:46:31,240
His name is actually

1038
00:46:31,240 --> 00:46:33,240
Krishna Pandit Banji.

1039
00:46:33,240 --> 00:46:35,240
His name is Ashley Madison.

1040
00:46:35,240 --> 00:46:37,240
[laughter]

1041
00:46:37,240 --> 00:46:41,240
Ashley Madison the actor.

1042
00:46:41,240 --> 00:46:43,240
Nice to meet you.

1043
00:46:43,240 --> 00:46:45,240
Nice to meet you, I'm Ashley Madison.

1044
00:46:45,240 --> 00:46:46,240
Next.

1045
00:46:46,240 --> 00:46:52,160
You know, this whole time I thought Ben Kingsley was doing brownface by playing Gandhi, but

1046
00:46:52,160 --> 00:46:53,800
turns out he's just an Indian guy.

1047
00:46:53,800 --> 00:46:56,160
I think he's, yeah, he's like half Indian or something.

1048
00:46:56,160 --> 00:46:57,160
Yeah.

1049
00:46:57,160 --> 00:46:58,160
People were still mad about it though.

1050
00:46:58,160 --> 00:46:59,160
Yeah, that's weird.

1051
00:46:59,160 --> 00:47:01,280
It's like that, do you guys watch Cutthroat Kitchen?

1052
00:47:01,280 --> 00:47:02,280
No.

1053
00:47:02,280 --> 00:47:03,280
Oh.

1054
00:47:03,280 --> 00:47:04,280
No.

1055
00:47:04,280 --> 00:47:05,280
They have that.

1056
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:06,280
That's the one where Alton Brown.

1057
00:47:06,280 --> 00:47:07,280
Alton Brown, yeah.

1058
00:47:07,280 --> 00:47:08,280
Yeah.

1059
00:47:08,280 --> 00:47:10,680
But they have a judge who's Indian, but he just looks like, he has a British accent and

1060
00:47:10,680 --> 00:47:12,080
just looks like a white guy.

1061
00:47:12,080 --> 00:47:13,080
Yeah.

1062
00:47:13,080 --> 00:47:14,760
And it just weirds me out.

1063
00:47:14,760 --> 00:47:28,000
not right. Christ. Yeah. I don't watch any cooking shows anymore. Yeah, Cutthroat Kitchen. I

1064
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:33,160
watched that because Anna likes it. They, Cutthroat Kitchen gets a bunch of their like,

1065
00:47:33,160 --> 00:47:38,480
you know, like the stuff that they use to be like, oh, you have to chop onions. You

1066
00:47:38,480 --> 00:47:43,840
have to chop onions using these claws or whatever. You mean the challenges? Yes, the challenges,

1067
00:47:43,840 --> 00:47:48,840
- The sabotages are all BDSM like stuff

1068
00:47:48,840 --> 00:47:52,040
that Alton Brown buys.

1069
00:47:52,040 --> 00:47:52,880
- What?

1070
00:47:52,880 --> 00:47:53,700
- What the hell?

1071
00:47:53,700 --> 00:47:54,540
- That's not true.

1072
00:47:54,540 --> 00:47:55,380
- Yeah, it is.

1073
00:47:55,380 --> 00:47:56,480
- No, a bunch of them are like,

1074
00:47:56,480 --> 00:47:58,840
you have to cook using no salt.

1075
00:47:58,840 --> 00:48:00,240
- You have to, yeah, but there's some of them

1076
00:48:00,240 --> 00:48:01,080
where it's like--

1077
00:48:01,080 --> 00:48:01,900
- BDSM stuff.

1078
00:48:01,900 --> 00:48:04,000
- There's some of them, some of them,

1079
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:04,840
they're like--

1080
00:48:04,840 --> 00:48:07,840
- That is BDSM to Alton Brown.

1081
00:48:07,840 --> 00:48:09,440
He's so into food.

1082
00:48:09,440 --> 00:48:10,680
- BDSM to him is--

1083
00:48:10,680 --> 00:48:11,520
- Yeah.

1084
00:48:11,520 --> 00:48:12,340
- No, but he uses--

1085
00:48:12,340 --> 00:48:13,180
- He's cooking with no salt.

1086
00:48:13,180 --> 00:48:16,780
Like it's like oh you have to cook your meal using these shackles

1087
00:48:16,780 --> 00:48:22,020
They've never done that. Yes. They have dude. Yes, maybe once or twice

1088
00:48:22,020 --> 00:48:28,860
Most of them are like you have to ride around this bike from station to station. I don't think they stop doing it because they got hot

1089
00:48:28,860 --> 00:48:30,900
Yeah

1090
00:48:30,900 --> 00:48:35,900
Into the new podcast where Cameron and Patrick talk about a TV show that Caleb has never

1091
00:48:35,900 --> 00:48:38,420
Seen okay

1092
00:48:39,100 --> 00:48:45,520
Fuckers talk about it's I've never seen jackass. I have to listen to you guys. What about it? It's called. Yeah stupid

1093
00:48:45,520 --> 00:48:48,220
No

1094
00:48:48,220 --> 00:48:50,580
What the fuck? Yeah, that's right

1095
00:48:50,580 --> 00:48:55,420
What is fun, yeah, I have to listen to it every

1096
00:48:55,420 --> 00:48:59,900
Talking about that exactly

1097
00:48:59,900 --> 00:49:04,540
And I don't complain because I like listening to it

1098
00:49:05,580 --> 00:49:07,900
It's been fucking just, it's so easy to watch it.

1099
00:49:07,900 --> 00:49:08,740
- It's an hour and a half.

1100
00:49:08,740 --> 00:49:10,020
- I haven't gotten around to it yet.

1101
00:49:10,020 --> 00:49:11,900
- Oh, you haven't gotten around to it?

1102
00:49:11,900 --> 00:49:12,740
- No.

1103
00:49:12,740 --> 00:49:13,560
- He's watched, he's watched every--

1104
00:49:13,560 --> 00:49:14,400
- I think it's funny not to watch it

1105
00:49:14,400 --> 00:49:15,740
'cause it makes you angry.

1106
00:49:15,740 --> 00:49:16,580
- He's watched every monster movie about--

1107
00:49:16,580 --> 00:49:18,420
- It doesn't make me angry, I just don't understand.

1108
00:49:18,420 --> 00:49:21,300
- Kitchen appliances that become very big

1109
00:49:21,300 --> 00:49:23,740
and fight Japan, fight the Japanese jackass.

1110
00:49:23,740 --> 00:49:25,740
- Cameron watches stuff called like,

1111
00:49:25,740 --> 00:49:30,260
The Lovely Nephew.

1112
00:49:30,260 --> 00:49:33,740
- He'll watch a 15 hour, The Lovely Nephew.

1113
00:49:33,740 --> 00:49:35,060
Yeah, that's the American translation.

1114
00:49:35,060 --> 00:49:38,480
That's actually a very beautiful film.

1115
00:49:38,480 --> 00:49:42,340
It has a very strong emotional core and the actors are brilliant.

1116
00:49:42,340 --> 00:49:44,940
It's the same cinematographer as Mandy.

1117
00:49:44,940 --> 00:49:45,940
Yeah.

1118
00:49:45,940 --> 00:49:48,140
It looks exactly the same as Mandy.

1119
00:49:48,140 --> 00:49:52,420
How many times have you seen one half A press video and you haven't watched Jackass?

1120
00:49:52,420 --> 00:49:53,420
Probably like five.

1121
00:49:53,420 --> 00:49:55,820
That video is like 20 minutes long.

1122
00:49:55,820 --> 00:49:56,820
What is Jackass on?

1123
00:49:56,820 --> 00:49:58,180
You've seen Godzilla one million times.

1124
00:49:58,180 --> 00:50:01,340
Jackass is on Patrick's computer.

1125
00:50:01,340 --> 00:50:02,340
Probably.

1126
00:50:02,340 --> 00:50:03,340
Yeah.

1127
00:50:03,340 --> 00:50:05,340
Listen, I don't...

1128
00:50:05,340 --> 00:50:07,340
We gotta watch Jackass, man.

1129
00:50:07,340 --> 00:50:09,340
Jackass 3 is on Amazon Prime.

1130
00:50:09,340 --> 00:50:11,340
It's imperative for you to know what we're doing here.

1131
00:50:11,340 --> 00:50:13,340
Yeah.

1132
00:50:13,340 --> 00:50:15,340
Like the goal of this podcast is to eventually reach a...

1133
00:50:15,340 --> 00:50:17,340
Eventually to become Jackass 4.

1134
00:50:17,340 --> 00:50:19,340
I know what Jackass is.

1135
00:50:19,340 --> 00:50:21,340
I know I can do it.

1136
00:50:21,340 --> 00:50:23,340
Oh, that's not enough, dude.

1137
00:50:23,340 --> 00:50:25,340
Here's a test. What is it?

1138
00:50:25,340 --> 00:50:27,340
It's about a donkey, right?

1139
00:50:27,340 --> 00:50:29,340
NOOOOOO!

1140
00:50:29,340 --> 00:50:31,340
Oh my god.

1141
00:50:31,340 --> 00:50:31,840
No!

1142
00:50:31,840 --> 00:50:33,340
I just don't get it.

1143
00:50:33,340 --> 00:50:35,340
It's about six donkeys if you know what I mean.

1144
00:50:35,340 --> 00:50:36,340
It's about four-

1145
00:50:36,340 --> 00:50:37,340
We're all best friends.

1146
00:50:37,340 --> 00:50:41,340
It's about four high school friends who play pranks on each other.

1147
00:50:41,340 --> 00:50:43,340
And at the end of the episode-

1148
00:50:43,340 --> 00:50:45,340
Much to the chagrin of their parents.

1149
00:50:45,340 --> 00:50:51,340
At the end of each of the episodes, one of them is awarded that night's biggest loser.

1150
00:50:51,340 --> 00:50:53,340
It's about sucking farts in fucking Boston.

1151
00:50:53,340 --> 00:50:55,340
So they copied it from the biggest loser?

1152
00:50:57,340 --> 00:51:02,180
Yeah, it's about 12 people who are placed on an island and they have to survive, right?

1153
00:51:02,180 --> 00:51:06,380
And so they, each week they vote each other off the island with tiki torches.

1154
00:51:06,380 --> 00:51:09,900
Some of them might actually be having sex, but you're not allowed to show that on TV.

1155
00:51:09,900 --> 00:51:11,580
Yeah, that was Jackass 1.

1156
00:51:11,580 --> 00:51:18,980
Jackass 2 is when it's 12 beautiful women and Preston Lacey, and each night Preston Lacey

1157
00:51:18,980 --> 00:51:27,820
decides which woman he's going to give his rock and roll VIP pass to.

1158
00:51:27,820 --> 00:51:31,100
And there's a lot of fighting between the women.

1159
00:51:31,100 --> 00:51:35,740
Yeah, and also it's simultaneously a weight loss show.

1160
00:51:35,740 --> 00:51:40,280
They should do a version of The Bachelor that's also the biggest loser.

1161
00:51:40,280 --> 00:51:44,140
He's like, "You gotta be under 120 to fuck me."

1162
00:51:44,140 --> 00:51:47,140
twelve personal trainers and one fat billionaire.

1163
00:51:47,140 --> 00:51:49,140
And one really fat bitch.

1164
00:51:49,140 --> 00:51:50,140
Yeah.

1165
00:51:50,140 --> 00:51:54,140
That he has an idea might be hot once he loses weight.

1166
00:51:54,140 --> 00:51:55,140
Yeah.

1167
00:51:55,140 --> 00:51:56,140
And that's the whole show.

1168
00:51:56,140 --> 00:51:58,640
And also you have to do it with shackles on.

1169
00:51:58,640 --> 00:51:59,640
Uh huh.

1170
00:51:59,640 --> 00:52:00,640
Like.

1171
00:52:00,640 --> 00:52:01,640
And you don't get to eat salt.

1172
00:52:01,640 --> 00:52:02,640
And.

1173
00:52:02,640 --> 00:52:10,140
I like the idea that Alton Brown watched like the Amistad and then the next day he walked

1174
00:52:10,140 --> 00:52:17,140
And he was like, "Yeah, what if we chain them all together and we start beating the shit out of them while they make the food?"

1175
00:52:17,140 --> 00:52:24,140
I had to watch... I had to fuckin'... I don't know why, but I had to watch Amistad in my music class in 8th grade.

1176
00:52:24,140 --> 00:52:28,140
My mom showed me that movie when I was like 8 years old and she was like...

1177
00:52:28,140 --> 00:52:29,140
I don't know what it is.

1178
00:52:29,140 --> 00:52:31,140
It's a movie about the slave trade.

1179
00:52:31,140 --> 00:52:33,140
It's kinda like Jackass.

1180
00:52:33,140 --> 00:52:36,140
It's why you haven't seen it, it's cause it's like that.

1181
00:52:36,140 --> 00:52:38,140
I'm never gonna watch Jackass. I don't care.

1182
00:52:38,140 --> 00:52:39,140
I don't know.

1183
00:52:39,140 --> 00:52:40,140
The Amistad is a movie about...

1184
00:52:40,140 --> 00:52:42,940
That's why I'm not going to watch it because I think it's funny to you.

1185
00:52:42,940 --> 00:52:44,340
It's about a slave ship.

1186
00:52:44,340 --> 00:52:52,860
It's about a Supreme Court case that was like, it was like basically like people, like slaves

1187
00:52:52,860 --> 00:52:56,460
from the, who were on the ship called the Amistad.

1188
00:52:56,460 --> 00:53:01,060
They were like sentenced to death for like revolting or something and killing the captain

1189
00:53:01,060 --> 00:53:04,080
and then they, it was this like court case.

1190
00:53:04,080 --> 00:53:09,080
But most of it is just like, just black people getting the shit kicked out of them.

1191
00:53:09,080 --> 00:53:10,080
It's a horrible movie.

1192
00:53:10,080 --> 00:53:12,480
There is no fun music in that movie.

1193
00:53:12,480 --> 00:53:16,080
We watched Little Shop of Horrors.

1194
00:53:16,080 --> 00:53:21,760
I forgot you said that you watched it at music class and I thought you were just saying.

1195
00:53:21,760 --> 00:53:25,280
There's no fun music in that movie.

1196
00:53:25,280 --> 00:53:26,280
It's crazy.

1197
00:53:26,280 --> 00:53:31,640
Dude, we had to watch Little Shop of Horrors with Rick Moranis and then the week after we

1198
00:53:31,640 --> 00:53:34,080
we watched Amistad for some reason.

1199
00:53:34,080 --> 00:53:35,880
- Damn dude, yeah that's a big downgrade.

1200
00:53:35,880 --> 00:53:38,000
- That makes no fucking sense.

1201
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:41,680
- And your professor thought it was the musical Amistad,

1202
00:53:41,680 --> 00:53:43,200
he got the wrong DVD.

1203
00:53:43,200 --> 00:53:46,760
He thought it was the musical adaptation of that story.

1204
00:53:46,760 --> 00:53:48,320
- Did they make a musical adaptation?

1205
00:53:48,320 --> 00:53:49,160
- No.

1206
00:53:49,160 --> 00:53:51,080
- Yeah dude, yeah they did.

1207
00:53:51,080 --> 00:53:54,960
The same people who, it was Trey Parker and--

1208
00:53:54,960 --> 00:53:55,800

00:53:55,800 --> 00:53:58,040
(laughing)

1210
00:53:58,040 --> 00:54:00,280

1211
00:54:00,280 --> 00:54:03,420

1213
00:54:05,360 --> 00:54:06,200
- Oh no.

1214
00:54:06,200 --> 00:54:07,020
- Oh no.

1215
00:54:07,020 --> 00:54:07,860

1216
00:54:07,860 --> 00:54:08,700

1217
00:54:08,700 --> 00:54:09,520
- Oh no.

1218
00:54:09,520 --> 00:54:10,360
- Oh no.

1219
00:54:10,360 --> 00:54:11,520
- I don't think they did do that.

1220
00:54:11,520 --> 00:54:12,360
- Yeah, it's like--

1221
00:54:12,360 --> 00:54:13,200
- I think they did.

1222
00:54:13,200 --> 00:54:14,020
- They made--

1223
00:54:14,020 --> 00:54:14,860
- I think they're working on it right now.

1224
00:54:14,860 --> 00:54:15,700
- Yeah.

1225
00:54:15,700 --> 00:54:17,020
- And I got insider information

1226
00:54:17,020 --> 00:54:17,860
that I wasn't supposed to--

1227
00:54:17,860 --> 00:54:20,380
- 'Cause your uncle, your uncle Trey Parker.

1228
00:54:20,380 --> 00:54:21,220
- The lovely uncle.

1229
00:54:21,220 --> 00:54:25,000
- I got inside her information.

1230
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:26,340
Did you know that there's a hole,

1231
00:54:26,340 --> 00:54:27,580
there's two holes down there?

1232
00:54:27,580 --> 00:54:29,720
There's three.

1233
00:54:29,720 --> 00:54:31,340
There's three holes down there.

1234
00:54:31,340 --> 00:54:32,660
There's three.

1235
00:54:32,660 --> 00:54:36,080
And also, you know they have a weird penis down there?

1236
00:54:36,080 --> 00:54:38,640
A weird little peeny head that you gotta click?

1237
00:54:38,640 --> 00:54:41,100
Fucked up.

1238
00:54:41,100 --> 00:54:46,500
That's called inside her information, baby.

1239
00:54:46,500 --> 00:54:47,340
Yeah.

1240
00:54:47,340 --> 00:54:48,160
Yeah.

1241
00:54:48,160 --> 00:54:50,620
Inside her, I'm inside her trading.

1242
00:54:50,620 --> 00:54:51,460
Yeah.

1243
00:54:51,460 --> 00:54:54,660
Trading Pokemon to myself.

1244
00:54:54,660 --> 00:54:56,800
I just traded myself a Gengar.

1245
00:54:56,800 --> 00:54:59,760
(laughing)

1246
00:54:59,760 --> 00:55:01,720
- My headphones are messed up again, hold on.

1247
00:55:01,720 --> 00:55:02,640
- Yeah.

1248
00:55:02,640 --> 00:55:05,320
- Yeah, you guys talk about something awesome.

1249
00:55:05,320 --> 00:55:06,600
- Okay.

1250
00:55:06,600 --> 00:55:07,760
- Wow, fixed 'em.

1251
00:55:07,760 --> 00:55:09,960
See, you guys didn't even have an awesome topic

1252
00:55:09,960 --> 00:55:10,780
to talk about.

1253
00:55:10,780 --> 00:55:13,520
Me, on the other hand, I have tons.

1254
00:55:13,520 --> 00:55:14,480
- All right, go ahead.

1255
00:55:14,480 --> 00:55:15,320
List a ton.

1256
00:55:15,320 --> 00:55:17,280
Don't talk about them, but just list them.

1257
00:55:17,280 --> 00:55:20,320
- I was thinking about Dr. Robotnik.

1258
00:55:20,320 --> 00:55:21,560
- Doctor who?

1259
00:55:21,560 --> 00:55:22,400
- Dr. Robotnik.

1260
00:55:22,400 --> 00:55:23,220
- Is that what you were saying?

1261
00:55:23,220 --> 00:55:24,060
- Dr. Who?

1262
00:55:24,060 --> 00:55:25,400
- No, Dr. Robotnik.

1263
00:55:25,400 --> 00:55:34,020
Do you think Dr. Robotnik has a perfectly flushed penis to his fupa?

1264
00:55:34,020 --> 00:55:36,980
Like it doesn't come outside of it at all?

1265
00:55:36,980 --> 00:55:41,840
And also like there's no like, you know that flap that big fat people have from their stomach

1266
00:55:41,840 --> 00:55:43,860
that sometimes covers their balls and their penis?

1267
00:55:43,860 --> 00:55:45,020
Do you think he has one of those?

1268
00:55:45,020 --> 00:55:47,340
I wouldn't, I'm not familiar with that flap.

1269
00:55:47,340 --> 00:55:49,020
Yeah you are.

1270
00:55:49,020 --> 00:55:50,900
No I'm not, I think that's a you problem.

1271
00:55:50,900 --> 00:55:53,300
No you're very, you're oh so familiar with it.

1272
00:55:53,300 --> 00:55:55,260
- You're familiar with it 'cause you have one.

1273
00:55:55,260 --> 00:55:58,060
- You hide cheeseburgers underneath it.

1274
00:55:58,060 --> 00:55:59,380
- Yeah, yeah, you hide-- - You do.

1275
00:55:59,380 --> 00:56:00,620
It's a satchel.

1276
00:56:00,620 --> 00:56:02,860
You use it as a laptop case.

1277
00:56:02,860 --> 00:56:06,460
- You have a little GPS that you keep under there.

1278
00:56:06,460 --> 00:56:08,560
- You have a little.

1279
00:56:08,560 --> 00:56:09,400
You are little, dude.

1280
00:56:09,400 --> 00:56:10,480
You're the littlest one.

1281
00:56:10,480 --> 00:56:12,700
What is it like to be the littlest podcast host?

1282
00:56:12,700 --> 00:56:15,180
- The littlest podcast, that's my favorite.

1283
00:56:15,180 --> 00:56:19,260
- The most adorable and smallest podcast host.

1284
00:56:19,260 --> 00:56:21,180
Littlest podcast host, it's a movie about Patrick.

1285
00:56:21,180 --> 00:56:27,100

1286
00:56:27,100 --> 00:56:31,100

00:56:43,780 --> 00:56:48,840
own that dude I think that's it's sure it's Sherlock Holmes it's not bad it is

1290
00:56:48,840 --> 00:56:55,440
bad. Because you hate, you hate clues. I, no I actually, you hate looking for clues. No,

1291
00:56:55,440 --> 00:57:00,840
I actually love clues. No, you hate clues and you hate looking for clues. Sherlock Holmes

1292
00:57:00,840 --> 00:57:05,320
doesn't matter to me because it's so below my intellect. I'm working on tons of clue

1293
00:57:05,320 --> 00:57:09,680
based projects right now. I mean personally, I hate clues because I don't even need them

1294
00:57:09,680 --> 00:57:15,320
to solve a mystery. I just know the answer when I look at the crime. I have, I have a,

1295
00:57:15,320 --> 00:57:18,680
You guys can't see it, but on the other side of my webcam I have a wall covered in clues.

1296
00:57:18,680 --> 00:57:19,680
Yeah, covered in blues clues.

1297
00:57:19,680 --> 00:57:22,680
Yeah, you have blue pop raps all over your walls.

1298
00:57:22,680 --> 00:57:24,760
Blue blues clues wallpaper.

1299
00:57:24,760 --> 00:57:25,760
That's a clue.

1300
00:57:25,760 --> 00:57:26,760
That's a kind of clue.

1301
00:57:26,760 --> 00:57:29,760
Just because it's a blue clue doesn't mean it's not a clue.

1302
00:57:29,760 --> 00:57:31,640
Nah, I beg to differ.

1303
00:57:31,640 --> 00:57:32,640
What, an idiot?

1304
00:57:32,640 --> 00:57:33,640

00:57:33,640 --> 00:57:34,640
Well, tell me, give me a clue.

What kind of clue do you have for me?

1329
00:59:11,480 --> 00:59:12,320
- Nah.

1330
00:59:12,320 --> 00:59:13,680
- He does, dude, he did.

1331
00:59:13,680 --> 00:59:17,240
- They said they're mad at you for your video.

1332
00:59:17,240 --> 00:59:19,240
- No, they're mad at you for your video.

1333
00:59:19,240 --> 00:59:20,540
- What video?

1334
00:59:20,540 --> 00:59:23,380
- Who knows, 'cause you suck at videos.

1335
00:59:23,380 --> 00:59:24,580
- Oh!

00:59:24,580 --> 00:59:25,440
- The videos are so bad,

1337
00:59:25,440 --> 00:59:27,060
you can't even tell which one is which.

1338
00:59:27,060 --> 00:59:29,620
- I don't even, yeah, the video, yeah, exactly.

1339
00:59:29,620 --> 00:59:32,140
I can't even tell these videos apart.

1340
00:59:32,140 --> 00:59:33,220
- Yeah, they're all the same.

1341
00:59:33,220 --> 00:59:36,620
- Patrick, yeah, Patrick has TikTok on his phone.

1342
00:59:36,620 --> 00:59:38,860
And that's all I need to say on the subject

1343
00:59:38,860 --> 00:59:40,660
of why Patrick should be in jail.

1344
00:59:40,660 --> 00:59:45,140
- We have to get you off of that app, dude.

1345
00:59:45,140 --> 00:59:46,300
- Yeah. - No, it's funny.

1346
00:59:46,300 --> 00:59:47,140
- It's not good for you.

1347
00:59:47,140 --> 00:59:48,900
- You can't be on that app.

1348
00:59:48,900 --> 00:59:49,740
- Nah, dude. - Why?

1349
00:59:49,740 --> 00:59:51,940
- It's just not. - 'Cause that's just one--

1350
00:59:51,940 --> 00:59:53,500
- Yeah, no exceptions.

1351
00:59:53,500 --> 00:59:56,300
Over 21, you can't use that app.

1352
00:59:56,300 --> 00:59:57,140
That's like--

1353
00:59:57,140 --> 00:59:59,140
- There are older people than me on there.

1354
00:59:59,140 --> 00:59:59,980
- You got that mom too.

1355
00:59:59,980 --> 01:00:01,520
- And you liked him?

1356
01:00:01,520 --> 01:00:02,360
- Yeah.

1357
01:00:02,360 --> 01:00:05,280
- Did you see that guy I sent you?

1358
01:00:05,280 --> 01:00:06,120
- I don't.

1359
01:00:06,120 --> 01:00:06,940
- No.

1360
01:00:06,940 --> 01:00:07,780
- The flat earth guy?

1361
01:00:07,780 --> 01:00:08,620
- I never watch any of them.

1362
01:00:08,620 --> 01:00:09,620
- You don't watch any of them?

1363
01:00:09,620 --> 01:00:12,580
- I only watch the ones of old people.

1364
01:00:12,580 --> 01:00:14,660
- You're so upset.

1365
01:00:14,660 --> 01:00:16,260
- You really don't watch those TikToks?

1366
01:00:16,260 --> 01:00:17,780
- You don't watch the ones I send you?

1367
01:00:17,780 --> 01:00:18,660
- Are you serious?

1368
01:00:18,660 --> 01:00:20,500
- No, I don't.

1369
01:00:20,500 --> 01:00:22,140
- But yeah, I don't think there's a single exception

1370
01:00:22,140 --> 01:00:22,980
to that rule.

1371
01:00:22,980 --> 01:00:24,660
If you're an adult and you're on that app,

1372
01:00:24,660 --> 01:00:26,540
I don't respect you.

1373
01:00:26,540 --> 01:00:27,380
- Yeah.

1374
01:00:27,380 --> 01:00:31,100
and i think you should be uh... put into a whole and you stay there

1375
01:00:31,100 --> 01:00:33,260
down i think i'm not think i'm the exception

1376
01:00:33,260 --> 01:00:36,980
