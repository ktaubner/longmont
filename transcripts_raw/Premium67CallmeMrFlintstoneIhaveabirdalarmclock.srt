00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:02,040
then we'll construct like a like a year-long like Truman show type thing

134
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:06,240
where everybody's just acting around him but he's just doing whatever he actually

I just thought. So what did you think I was calling you up for then? I don't know I

165
00:10:10,020 --> 00:10:13,380
thought I looked at it for a second and I saw the word Orthodox so I just assumed

166
00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:22,180
that it was Greek. I didn't realize there's other... I didn't know... you know what else?

167
00:10:22,180 --> 00:10:26,900
You know what else is? I didn't assume that there were other Orthodox churches.

168
00:10:26,900 --> 00:10:31,100
I thought there was like my whole life I've only heard Greek Orthodox.

169
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:33,780
This is what you thought about when you looked at the word Cyrillic.

170
00:10:33,780 --> 00:10:35,780
No, I looked at the word Cyrillic.

171
00:10:35,780 --> 00:10:37,780
You like transported into every moment of your life.

172
00:10:37,780 --> 00:10:39,780
You have like the most powerful brain of all time.

173
00:10:39,780 --> 00:10:41,780
You're driven by a Greek Orthodox Church.

174
00:10:41,780 --> 00:10:48,460
But you just can't go from point A to point B, it has to go through orthodox churches first.

175
00:10:48,460 --> 00:10:52,940
I want to get Pat into one of those brain computer interfaces, see what happens.

176
00:10:52,940 --> 00:10:53,940
You know those things?

177
00:10:53,940 --> 00:10:56,740
They control your brain with magnets?

178
00:10:56,740 --> 00:10:59,620
A computer wouldn't work if it had my brain.

179
00:10:59,620 --> 00:11:06,500
Yeah, it's just like the Karen computer from Spongebob and on the screen it's just like

180
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:08,500
it killing itself.

181
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:15,740
as soon as like my brain they plug a USB into my brain yeah you are probably them

182
00:11:15,740 --> 00:11:19,820
if this is the matrix you are the most likely man to fall out of it yeah yeah

183
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:23,460

211
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:09,200
How how are these women sitting down? How are you not losing your fucking mind when someone does this in front of you?

212
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:15,620
Completely still are you not like like holding up a sign? It's 10 like it's

213
00:14:15,620 --> 00:14:20,340

214
00:14:20,340 --> 00:14:34,060
Somebody help him the

215
00:14:34,060 --> 00:14:36,740
Momentum he can't stop

216
00:14:38,540 --> 00:14:44,140
It's gonna spoke you should get that guy to do mocap for a droideka in the next Star Wars. Oh, dude

00:15:08,460 --> 00:15:12,060
We'll say

220
00:15:12,060 --> 00:15:15,980
We'll say it's like a new blaster, I don't fucking know

221
00:15:15,980 --> 00:15:25,000
Yeah, they harvested enough guy that's a kyber crystal actually that's why it's it's flopping around like that

222
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:33,020
Damn dude, maybe I need to get into I feel like that's the easiest way to get in shape become a maelstrom

223
00:15:33,020 --> 00:15:37,180
yeah I think that's the move because you also you're not doing the pole stuff you

224
00:15:37,180 --> 00:15:41,260
know you're just shaking your so yeah yeah and then also male strippers also

225
00:15:41,260 --> 00:15:45,980
get to dress in really cool costumes that's true that's so true be happy

226
00:15:45,980 --> 00:15:48,820
more ever you want

227
00:15:54,460 --> 00:15:57,740
A pirate take off all those fucking buckles?

Yeah, yeah, it's got like Victorian like frocks and stuff under your jacket.

229
00:16:02,540 --> 00:16:04,700
It would be like a stripper version.

230
00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:05,700
You know.

231
00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:09,100
It would smell like fucking salted horse that's 50 years old.

232
00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:11,380
It's just been on his hip.

233
00:16:11,380 --> 00:16:17,620
A sexy nurse outfit, you're not wearing scrubs, you know, there would be a sexy, sexual fucking

234
00:16:17,620 --> 00:16:18,620
penis butt.

235
00:16:18,620 --> 00:16:20,820
That was a jewel hit.

236
00:16:20,820 --> 00:16:22,660
Sex version of Captain Morgan.

237
00:16:22,660 --> 00:16:24,660
Do you think there's a Jack Sparrow stripper?

238
00:16:24,660 --> 00:16:27,660
Yeah, there's sexy Jack Sparrow.

239
00:16:27,660 --> 00:16:28,660

Yeah.

241
00:16:29,660 --> 00:16:30,660
Are you kidding?

242
00:16:30,660 --> 00:16:31,660
But can he do flips?

243
00:16:31,660 --> 00:16:33,660
Yeah, can he do this fucking shit?

244
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:35,660
He cannot do flips. No way.

245
00:16:35,660 --> 00:16:37,660
I still have the video open.

246
00:16:37,660 --> 00:16:39,660
I'm still watching it.

247
00:16:39,660 --> 00:16:41,660
It's crazy.

248
00:16:41,660 --> 00:16:44,660
Yeah, it really just bothers me that the women aren't just losing their minds.

249
00:16:44,660 --> 00:16:45,660
Yeah.

250
00:16:45,660 --> 00:16:51,660
Yeah, they need to be doing the worm, and they need to be in celebration, you know what I mean,

251
00:16:51,660 --> 00:16:55,500
I mean for what they're seeing they're basically witnessing like like like a

252
00:16:55,500 --> 00:17:00,060
Christ level miracle like in turning water to wine and they're just unfazed

253
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:06,620
There's one woman's just one hand down, but just touches the ground for like half a second. Yeah. Oh

254
00:17:06,620 --> 00:17:11,740
My god, you know we need to do we need to invent a device where you can

255
00:17:11,740 --> 00:17:16,480
See the different frames of him moving and in slow motion

256
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:19,540
So we can tell if there's any point where all of his feet are off the ground

257
00:17:19,980 --> 00:17:24,260
Yeah, yeah, you know, I feel like I need to download this video. I don't know

258
00:17:24,260 --> 00:17:28,420
Yeah, we need to zoom in just to see

259
00:17:28,420 --> 00:17:33,860
To make sure just on different parts of his body just so yeah that you know, everything's in order

260
00:17:33,860 --> 00:17:38,300
Yeah, and also to make sure that it hasn't been digitally remastered into and there's no

261
00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:45,180
Maybe he could only do here's my theory right? He can only do this move completely naked because it's the

262
00:17:47,260 --> 00:17:49,480
Momentum of his ball swinging forward

263
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:55,620
Pendulous balls all this clothes would all these clothes would burn off

264
00:17:55,620 --> 00:18:07,300
That's how he strips do you just start spinning around

265
00:18:14,380 --> 00:18:18,620
This guy definitely like doing this long enough discovered like the Higgs boson

266
00:18:18,620 --> 00:18:21,420
Just from spinning matter

267
00:18:21,420 --> 00:18:24,060
Yeah

268
00:18:24,060 --> 00:18:26,060
See what happens see how fast

269
00:18:26,060 --> 00:18:32,820
That's the last thing that's gonna they're gonna fucking like rip open the portal to hell at CERN or whatever so to see you get that

270
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:37,860

271
00:18:37,860 --> 00:18:43,020
Collider and we destroyed the world and now we live in doom

272
00:18:43,020 --> 00:18:46,840
You know that picture that always goes around where there's like a statue of

275
00:18:56,340 --> 00:19:00,000

283
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:38,780
- Okay, let me, I'm trying to pull up this guy's profile.

284
00:19:38,780 --> 00:19:42,160
- He's not even a stripper, he just is an artist

285
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:43,760
who happens to be naked.

286
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:47,120
He is in no way a stripper.

287
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:48,380
- No. - No.

288
00:19:48,380 --> 00:19:51,140

through his profile so far, no acrobatics.

290
00:19:54,220 --> 00:19:56,220
No, he doesn't. He stopped...

291
00:19:56,220 --> 00:19:58,220
He stopped posting the fucking acrobatics...

292
00:19:58,220 --> 00:20:00,220
Well, I mean, COVID.

293
00:20:00,220 --> 00:20:02,220
I think COVID has ruined his acrobatics career.

294
00:20:02,220 --> 00:20:04,220
Wait, he's fucking all these women?

295
00:20:04,220 --> 00:20:06,220

346
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:11,360
as soon as he puts his hand on the ground he can you imagine if you if you

347
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:14,860
had the ability to do that to do that kind of flip just being able to be like

348
00:23:14,860 --> 00:23:18,640
oh I'm waiting in line to get into Market Basket because they're at capacity

349
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:22,640
I've been waiting 10 minutes I'm so bored

350
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:31,040
just doing it once and just not acknowledging it

351
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:38,840
do the way that he runs a mile like if he was in a race if he was in like a

352
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:45,600
a like a like a five meter dash or whatever or 500 meter dash he would be

353
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:51,440
charging up for like the first three quarters of the race just doing that and

354
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:56,120
then he lets go and then he just fucking he wins by a mile dude oh my god he's

355
00:23:56,120 --> 00:24:00,320
cheese powering up yeah and then at the end I you I guarantee at the end of

356
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:05,760
every time he spins he vomits because his inner ear is so fucked up

357
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:12,400
he's unlocked in the fucking strip club he just pukes all over the stage. I guess that's why he doesn't do it more.

358
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:18,320
yeah or maybe he has just like perfect spinning legs at this point he can just

359
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:23,360
it just doesn't phase him i don't know i i mean he's he's not a man he's a god you think yeah

360
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:28,640
do you think he was like you think he's like born in outer space or something like in a space station

361
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:33,760
so like his body is like like a gyroscope in it or something that might be true like some kind of

362
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:39,000
thing where he's like used to different gravity. He was definitely born in zero-g. This is the

363
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:45,840
first zero-g man dude. That's fucking incredible. We've been talking about this man for too

364
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:50,480
long. I mean it's tough when you see something that just like makes you so obsessed. It's

365
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:55,240
a paradigm shift. It's whenever you when you see somebody who when you see somebody who

366
00:24:55,240 --> 00:25:00,140
is better at one thing than you will ever be at anything in your life. Right. And that

367
00:25:00,140 --> 00:25:02,860
if that one thing is just spinning in certain...

368
00:25:02,860 --> 00:25:05,260
And by the way, his hips stay in the same place

369
00:25:05,260 --> 00:25:07,740
as far as like height the entire time.

370
00:25:07,740 --> 00:25:09,940
- The best part about this video is that

371
00:25:09,940 --> 00:25:12,180
you see the first hand, but then he keeps moving

372
00:25:12,180 --> 00:25:15,020
and then when he moves back, his hand is obscured

373
00:25:15,020 --> 00:25:17,680
by this other woman, the woman in the front row's head.

374
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:19,700
So you can't even see the hand.

375
00:25:19,700 --> 00:25:22,220
So he's just fucking, it looks like he's just spinning.

376
00:25:22,220 --> 00:25:25,800
Like it doesn't even look like he's doing like anything.

377
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:27,820
It just looks like he's doing that just based on

378
00:25:27,820 --> 00:25:29,500
like just sheer like power.

379
00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:33,340
what if he's like I bet nobody could knock him over what if he's like a

380
00:25:33,340 --> 00:25:38,700
superhero or like a demigod or something and he has like like unimaginable power

381
00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:43,900
but so he can't he can't like reveal it but he's like all right I could I could

382
00:25:43,900 --> 00:25:48,060
be a porn star and do a lot of flips though

383
00:25:48,060 --> 00:25:55,900
believe me yeah it's like spider-man like getting using his web to take cool

384
00:25:55,900 --> 00:26:02,580
pictures spinning to be the greatest stripper of all time

385
00:26:02,580 --> 00:26:06,620
one time he's in a strip club one time and he accidentally it was flipping

386
00:26:06,620 --> 00:26:12,660
accidentally just levitates like an inch off the floor yeah well that's what

387
00:26:12,660 --> 00:26:16,100
happened he accidentally levitated one time while he was at a strip club and

388
00:26:16,100 --> 00:26:19,300
then the owner came out who are you and he thought he's in trouble and he was

389
00:26:19,300 --> 00:26:28,340
like you start Monday yeah I mean what an incredible story yeah get a new chair

391
00:26:34,220 --> 00:26:38,940
thinking about it hold on please don't this is one of those like get a gaming

392
00:26:38,940 --> 00:26:42,060
chair this is one of those like old broken chairs that makes fart sounds

393
00:26:42,060 --> 00:26:46,340
when you move like to too slow yeah I have every piece of furniture in my bed

394
00:26:46,340 --> 00:26:52,940
actually or my my house all your furniture's on your bed no I do not keep

395
00:26:52,940 --> 00:26:56,900
all my furniture on my bed and I arrange my apartment so it doesn't scratch the

396
00:26:56,900 --> 00:27:01,300
floor well yeah that's what Jana Jana's very particular about the things that we

397
00:27:01,300 --> 00:27:04,540
have we're getting that security deposit back one way or another put those

398
00:27:04,540 --> 00:27:09,020
fucking chairs on the bed I put my wife in plastic so she wouldn't fuck up the

399
00:27:09,020 --> 00:27:15,220
security deposit just wrap what if you oh man that's a good idea putting your

400
00:27:15,220 --> 00:27:21,020
white and plastic. No, shrink wrapping your whole apartment. I think people have done

401
00:27:21,020 --> 00:27:26,220
that. Putting like just a thin layer of plastic on like every surface. Yeah, again

402
00:27:26,220 --> 00:27:31,040
you could just get away with farting all the time too. It's true. You'd be like, "Oh, it's my

403
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:36,220
cabinet." Yeah, there was a fart under the plastic and when I lifted it up and

404
00:27:36,220 --> 00:27:40,820
shifted it, the fart came out. Wait, isn't it a fetish where people want themselves shrink

405
00:27:40,820 --> 00:27:47,420
grabbed yeah oh my god people that the latex beds it's really where they put

406
00:27:47,420 --> 00:27:51,940

00:27:51,940 --> 00:27:56,300

You know what, they like that. That's the thing.

434
00:29:39,420 --> 00:29:41,420
When I was a kid I would just jizz on my belly.

435
00:29:41,420 --> 00:29:43,420
I bet they're like...

436
00:29:43,420 --> 00:29:46,920
I never thought about fucking coming into a piece of toilet paper,

437
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:49,420
so I would just cum on my belly and be like, "Ugh, it sucks!"

438
00:29:49,420 --> 00:29:51,420
"Ugh, man."

439
00:29:51,420 --> 00:29:53,420
"Disgusting."

440
00:29:53,420 --> 00:29:56,420
I knew somebody who would just jack off into the toilet,

441
00:29:56,420 --> 00:29:58,420
which always seemed so rude to me.

442
00:29:58,420 --> 00:30:00,680
(laughing)

443
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:03,620
- 'Cause that's like, it feels like you could do that,

444
00:30:03,620 --> 00:30:06,140
like, if you tell me that,

445
00:30:06,140 --> 00:30:07,800
every time you use the bathroom in my house,

446
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:09,660
I'm gonna be like, you're fuckin',

447
00:30:09,660 --> 00:30:11,100
you're cumming in my toilet.

448
00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:12,420
I'm about to walk into a-- - You put your tip.

449
00:30:12,420 --> 00:30:14,820
- The toilet bowl's about to look like a lava lamp

450
00:30:14,820 --> 00:30:15,900
when I walk back in.

451
00:30:15,900 --> 00:30:17,540
- You put your tip right under the water.

452
00:30:17,540 --> 00:30:19,460
- Yeah, exactly. - And you shut that shit in.

453
00:30:19,460 --> 00:30:20,300
- Yeah.

454
00:30:20,300 --> 00:30:23,780
- Try to, you're in my bathroom making oobleck.

455
00:30:23,780 --> 00:30:25,820
- You fuck the surface tension of the water

456
00:30:25,820 --> 00:30:28,140
until you fuckin' cum into the toilet bowl.

457
00:30:28,140 --> 00:30:28,980
- Ugh.

458
00:30:28,980 --> 00:30:30,340
- Back to the latex stuff.

459
00:30:30,340 --> 00:30:31,180
- Yeah.

460
00:30:31,180 --> 00:30:32,680
- Like, I feel like,

461
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:34,020
we were talking about like, you know,

462
00:30:34,020 --> 00:30:36,180
the diaper stuff and like how like,

463
00:30:36,180 --> 00:30:38,620

what caused it?

467
00:30:43,820 --> 00:30:44,980
Like is the latex thing just,

468
00:30:44,980 --> 00:30:46,700
is that like when you were born,

469
00:30:46,700 --> 00:30:48,700
your mom had like a really tight birth canal?

470
00:30:48,700 --> 00:30:53,620
- In a past life, you were a pair of scissors

471
00:30:53,620 --> 00:30:55,180
stuck in a plastic wrap.

472
00:30:55,180 --> 00:30:56,020
- Yeah.

473
00:30:56,020 --> 00:30:56,840
- Yeah.

474
00:30:56,840 --> 00:31:02,820

479
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:48,080

expensive yeah one of these crazy machine fetishes yeah you know like if you

481
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:58,520

483
00:32:05,060 --> 00:32:07,660
nightmare dude or yeah what if you're born in the wrong time what if you're a

484
00:32:07,660 --> 00:32:12,420
caveman who wants to be vacuum sealed and right wanded by a Japanese woman

485
00:32:12,420 --> 00:32:16,920
there's no none of known of those three three things exist when you're alive so

486
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:22,800
you just have to wait yeah it's very sad I mean it's so it's so fucking weird yeah

487
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:28,280
yeah what would it like what would happen if you were like born as a caveman and

488
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:33,680
but and you're really you were really horny from Morgan from Darkstalkers and

489
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:35,680

490
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:37,680
It's a really good point.

491
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:39,680
...invent video games

492
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:41,680
and then you have to wait for DeviantArt

493
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:43,680
to invent it. I guess I'll go jump in an iceberg

494
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:45,680
to see if it works.

495
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:47,680
I mean,

496
00:32:47,680 --> 00:32:49,680
the advent of technology

497
00:32:49,680 --> 00:32:51,680
has definitely created

498
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:53,680
a bunch of fucked up fetishes.

499
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:55,680
No, see, that's what we're saying.

500
00:32:55,680 --> 00:32:57,680
I think they existed before

501
00:32:57,680 --> 00:32:59,680
and there was no resources.

502
00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:01,680
Yeah, if you, when you're...

503
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:06,380

504
00:33:06,380 --> 00:33:11,440

505
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:17,140
you're like hey I have I actually have a fetish for like a machine like boxing

506
00:33:17,140 --> 00:33:21,020

507
00:33:21,020 --> 00:33:24,660
they wouldn't write it down we wouldn't know that people wanted that but Leonardo

508
00:33:24,660 --> 00:33:27,220
da Vinci was the first person who was like I'm gonna make some of this shit

509
00:33:27,220 --> 00:33:30,720
happened. And that's what drove him to invent so many things.

510
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:33,720
I'm a serf in the dark ages and my fetish is being the damn king.

511
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:41,220
You would go to your lord and you'd be like, "Yeah, I want a machine to speedbag my balls."

512
00:33:41,220 --> 00:33:44,520
And they'd be like, "Alright, you're a witch. You're sentenced to torture forever by our

513
00:33:44,520 --> 00:33:48,220
torturer speedbagging your balls." Oh no.

514
00:33:48,220 --> 00:33:53,940
Oh, I'm definitely a witch and I hate being drowned

515
00:33:53,940 --> 00:33:58,540

522
00:34:34,300 --> 00:34:37,260
Space you can fuck this space

523

525
00:34:51,220 --> 00:34:55,900
But then you can't then you can't be picky - what if the first alien would be right?

They don't have Bojangles in New York, right?

582
00:39:31,540 --> 00:39:33,540
I don't think so, it's a southern thing.

583
00:39:33,540 --> 00:39:34,540
Yeah.

584
00:39:34,540 --> 00:39:37,540
Yeah, it's one of the most fucked up restaurants of all time.

585
00:39:37,540 --> 00:39:39,540
I've never even seen one.

586
00:39:39,540 --> 00:39:42,540
It sells chicken named after a clown and then like somehow the fries give you diarrhea.

587
00:39:42,540 --> 00:39:44,540
It's named after a clown?

588
00:39:44,540 --> 00:39:45,540

592
00:39:54,900 --> 00:40:11,100
Who's a guy who was a king Oh, what about a restaurant owned by Wendy?

593
00:40:14,180 --> 00:40:21,140
Would have the coolest restaurant ever if she had one. I had a when I was like five or four or five

594
00:40:21,140 --> 00:40:23,380
We had a we had a basset hound for like a week

595
00:40:23,380 --> 00:40:26,900
Bojangles, it was like one of those dogs that you get it like the mall

596
00:40:26,900 --> 00:40:31,740
You know like the mall dogs that like like when malls used to have pet stores

597
00:40:31,740 --> 00:40:34,300
You guys never saw a mall pet store

598
00:40:34,300 --> 00:40:37,340

00:40:40,260 --> 00:40:47,140
I'm sure they have all pet stores, but I've never seen one. Oh, yeah, like they're like puppy mills. Yeah

601
00:40:47,140 --> 00:40:49,580

602
00:40:49,580 --> 00:40:54,120
Like mall pet stores were like. Oh, yeah, they're a thing but there was like a

603
00:40:54,120 --> 00:41:00,700
But it's like the saddest dogs in the world just in like cages in like these glass

604
00:41:00,700 --> 00:41:03,900
Yeah, it always smells like shit because they're shitting dogs

605
00:41:03,900 --> 00:41:06,940
And they can't give a bone because they'll try to kill themselves with it, right?

606
00:41:06,940 --> 00:41:09,480
- Wait, we got a basset.

607
00:41:09,480 --> 00:41:10,640
- Give them a safety bone?

608
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:11,480
- Yeah.

609
00:41:11,480 --> 00:41:13,120
(laughing)

610
00:41:13,120 --> 00:41:13,960
- A breakaway bone.

611
00:41:13,960 --> 00:41:16,120
- They have to take the wiring out of their collars

612
00:41:16,120 --> 00:41:16,960
or whatever.

613
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:18,100
- Yeah, yeah.

614
00:41:18,100 --> 00:41:19,960
- We only had it for a week 'cause we got it for him

615
00:41:19,960 --> 00:41:21,840
and he had heartworms so bad that they were like,

616
00:41:21,840 --> 00:41:23,440
yeah, you gotta put it back.

617
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:26,280
- Heartworms is one of the most fucked up things ever.

618
00:41:26,280 --> 00:41:27,120
- I know.

619
00:41:27,120 --> 00:41:27,940
- It is nuts, dude.

620
00:41:27,940 --> 00:41:30,400
You have to give a dog heartworm medicine

621
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:32,120
every fucking month or whatever.

622
00:41:32,120 --> 00:41:34,240
- 'Cause it's like the food or whatever,

623
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:35,760
I don't know how the fuck they get 'em.

624
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:38,680
I think it's because they're so fucking inbred.

625
00:41:38,680 --> 00:41:41,400
- They're so, dude, I was thinking about that.

626
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:45,080
I saw a fucking picture of like a,

627
00:41:45,080 --> 00:41:46,800
I think it was a basset hound that I was looking at.

628
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:48,680
I was just like looking at like, the way like,

629
00:41:48,680 --> 00:41:50,880
it's fucking, you can see its eye sockets

630
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:51,840
'cause it's so droopy.

631
00:41:51,840 --> 00:41:53,760
And just like, compare that to a wolf.

632
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:54,600
Like it's nuts, dude.

633
00:41:54,600 --> 00:41:56,520
- And it is really funny that just like,

634
00:41:56,520 --> 00:41:59,080
there was one droopy dog and the guys were like,

635
00:41:59,080 --> 00:42:00,500
oh, it's kind of funny.

636
00:42:00,500 --> 00:42:02,600
- Yeah, let's keep it droopy.

637
00:42:02,600 --> 00:42:05,120
- Let's try and make him as droopy as possible.

638
00:42:05,120 --> 00:42:09,120
We've already done small and big and stupid.

639
00:42:09,120 --> 00:42:10,120
Let's do droopy now.

640
00:42:10,120 --> 00:42:16,840
The dog breeding convention, the guy who like, the guy who created the Rottweiler just fucking

641
00:42:16,840 --> 00:42:21,840
giving a swirly to the guy who created the Basset Hound.

642
00:42:21,840 --> 00:42:25,660
Like imagine, yeah, breeding dogs would be like, you know, like seeing a dog that looks

643
00:42:25,660 --> 00:42:29,800
kind of like a pug and like seeing a dog that looks kind of like a husky and be like, yeah,

644
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:33,400
I'm going, we're going to push the pug further.

645
00:42:33,400 --> 00:42:35,400
We have more pug.

646
00:42:35,400 --> 00:42:36,400
Yeah.

647
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:39,600
Add more of whatever fucked up thing.

648
00:42:39,600 --> 00:42:40,600
What's that?

649
00:42:40,600 --> 00:42:44,120
I think they make pugs by impregnating dogs with orange juice.

650
00:42:44,120 --> 00:42:47,640
And then a pug comes out.

651
00:42:47,640 --> 00:42:48,640
What are those?

652
00:42:48,640 --> 00:42:49,640
Oh, is it Shar-Pei?

653
00:42:49,640 --> 00:42:53,480
No, they just make the pug moms just give birth on a ten foot tall table.

654
00:42:53,480 --> 00:42:55,520
And the babies just fall out and hit the ground.

655
00:42:55,520 --> 00:42:59,440
We made a dog fucking accordion and this came out.

656
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:01,480
Have you ever seen a Shar-Pei?

657
00:43:01,480 --> 00:43:04,840
I have seen Shar-Pei from High School Musical. What a dime.

658
00:43:04,840 --> 00:43:08,760
I looked up a Shar-Pei recently because I saw somebody tweet about it and I was like,

659
00:43:08,760 --> 00:43:10,880
"I know they're not talking about..."

660
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:14,960
Yeah. "The Shar-Pei." Talking about THE Shar-Pei. Oh, yeah, these things are fucked up.

661
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:19,120
Those are the droopiest dogs of all. When they're puppies... They're not droopy, they're like...

662
00:43:19,120 --> 00:43:20,840
fucking like...

663
00:43:20,840 --> 00:43:26,040
nasty. They're just folds. Like their whole body is folds. Oh, Christ. It's like...

664
00:43:26,040 --> 00:43:26,920
I like them.

665
00:43:26,920 --> 00:43:29,320
I think it looks nice. This looks like a Japanese food.

666
00:43:29,320 --> 00:43:31,400
It's Chinese. It's a Chinese dog breed. It looks like a fucking...

667
00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:33,320
It looks like...

668
00:43:33,320 --> 00:43:34,600
It looks like a brain.

669
00:43:34,600 --> 00:43:35,880
It looks like a fucking like...

670
00:43:35,880 --> 00:43:41,840
like Hellraiser thing. Here's an article called "Shar-Pays are a Genetic Nightmare."

671
00:43:41,840 --> 00:43:43,320
I'm sure they are.

672
00:43:43,320 --> 00:43:49,600
They're really fucked. They have so much skin. That looks like what's inside like a fucking alien space helmet in like a 50's...

673
00:43:49,600 --> 00:43:51,120
Could you blow it up?

674
00:43:51,120 --> 00:43:52,680
Could you like add air to it?

675
00:43:52,680 --> 00:43:53,200
Oh.

676
00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:55,200
to like make it a big puffer fish?

677
00:43:55,200 --> 00:43:57,200
I didn't know what you meant by blow it up.

678
00:43:57,200 --> 00:43:59,200
I was like, yeah can you

679
00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:01,200
just hit that thing with a rocket launcher

680
00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:03,200
real quick?

681
00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:05,200
Look at this picture. It does look so delicious though.

682
00:44:05,200 --> 00:44:07,200
Look at this one. Yeah, I think I would eat one.

683
00:44:07,200 --> 00:44:09,200
If there was like a bun that looked like that, I would eat that.

684
00:44:09,200 --> 00:44:11,200
Yeah. Oh man, can you

685
00:44:11,200 --> 00:44:13,200
imagine how buttery it is?

686
00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:15,200
It's just a dog's asshole, man.

687
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:17,200
Come on.

688
00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:19,200
Can you imagine a foreskin on this thing?

689
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:21,200
Oh my god, that thing would hang down. That thing would drag on the ground

690
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:24,040
around like a fucking wedding can.

691
00:44:24,040 --> 00:44:24,960
- I wish that I was like this,

692
00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:26,680
get a lot of extra length I think.

693
00:44:26,680 --> 00:44:30,980
- It's fucked up that nature, I guess it wasn't nature,

694
00:44:30,980 --> 00:44:33,940
but that genetics allowed a dog that looks like this

695
00:44:33,940 --> 00:44:36,200
to happen and it doesn't have powers.

696
00:44:36,200 --> 00:44:37,040
- Right.

697
00:44:37,040 --> 00:44:38,040
- Like that's the trade off,

698
00:44:38,040 --> 00:44:40,240
I feel like it's like a Deadpool thing, right?

699
00:44:40,240 --> 00:44:42,740
You can look disgusting and nasty and awful,

700
00:44:42,740 --> 00:44:44,600
but you should get a healing factor

701
00:44:44,600 --> 00:44:47,480
or be able to stretch or have mind control or something.

702
00:44:47,480 --> 00:44:49,960
- It's funny that Deadpool's whole thing

703
00:44:49,960 --> 00:44:55,640
because he just didn't want to have cancer. Yeah, who would not want to have cancer?

704
00:44:55,640 --> 00:45:00,440
Just have cancer, you pussy. Just be a man about it.

705
00:45:00,440 --> 00:45:04,120
Yeah, I'm bald already. It's not that big of a deal. I'll get cancer.

706
00:45:04,120 --> 00:45:07,560
Imagine if a side effect of chemo is that people start talking to the camera.

707
00:45:07,560 --> 00:45:15,640
One time Neil told me that anytime you have like a weird leg pain, that's cancer.

708
00:45:16,360 --> 00:45:21,080
Really? Of course Neil said that. I don't know why that stuck with me so much

709
00:45:21,080 --> 00:45:25,160
because I was like that can't be true. Now that's going to stick with me.

710
00:45:25,160 --> 00:45:28,680
That is definitely one of those you guys know about that thing that's like

711
00:45:28,680 --> 00:45:32,680
it was on uh I when I was in high school I listened to some like

712
00:45:32,680 --> 00:45:35,880
radio lab about this or something but there's like a

713
00:45:35,880 --> 00:45:41,160
mental like like I don't even know how to describe it it's like people convince

714
00:45:41,160 --> 00:45:44,120
themselves that they have tiny little bugs living on their skin that itch them

715
00:45:44,120 --> 00:45:49,280
all the time yeah they don't exist but people bugs it's like fibers yeah but

716
00:45:49,280 --> 00:45:53,500
people will like you can you can also get like convince yourself that you have

717
00:45:53,500 --> 00:46:00,000
them just by hearing that they exist it's so fuck I'm in a bunch of more galon

718
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:07,720
why like there those people are like like there's so there a lot of overlap

719
00:46:07,720 --> 00:46:11,240
with like targeted individuals people they're genuinely insane like they part

720
00:46:11,240 --> 00:46:15,720
of the thing of morgulons is that no medical no like yeah there's no they

721
00:46:15,720 --> 00:46:19,560
won't acknowledge that they won't say it's a real thing but like so everybody

722
00:46:19,560 --> 00:46:24,200
who has it like is constantly let's like at war with their doctor or whatever and

723
00:46:24,200 --> 00:46:28,180
they like try they just like get they I see they fucking post in their Facebook

724
00:46:28,180 --> 00:46:31,720
groups they post like here's here's what I'm my daily medicines that I'm taking

725
00:46:31,720 --> 00:46:37,040
to to to like make the fibers leave my skin and it's literally like just a

726
00:46:37,040 --> 00:46:39,880
fucking handful of pills and it's like some of them are vitamins but some of

727
00:46:39,880 --> 00:46:45,200
just like random shit it's so nuts dude yeah as soon as you guys started talking

728
00:46:45,200 --> 00:46:49,400
about this I felt a weird thing on my hand

729
00:46:49,400 --> 00:46:55,400
was that I heard that on that podcast and then I was like isn't that kind of

730
00:46:55,400 --> 00:47:00,000
fucked up that you're like sending this out to millions of people right yeah

731
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:03,400
you're just like yeah there's these things that like they just happen when

732
00:47:03,400 --> 00:47:07,480
you hear about them sometimes and they come out of nowhere it's like it follows

733
00:47:07,480 --> 00:47:09,480
those except yeah exactly.

734
00:47:09,480 --> 00:47:10,480
One second.

735
00:47:10,480 --> 00:47:13,960
Oh here's the picture I found it this is I sent this to Pierce this because Pierce is

736
00:47:13,960 --> 00:47:17,480

737
00:47:17,480 --> 00:47:18,480

It's literally a bed cover.

743
00:47:31,600 --> 00:47:33,960

swords out of that to conduct light energy yeah it does like a rock b fucking bismuth

759
00:48:59,520 --> 00:49:01,920
Bismuth is a metal, pepto-bismol.

760
00:49:01,920 --> 00:49:03,480
- Oh yeah, true. - The ingredient in

761
00:49:03,480 --> 00:49:05,760
- Yeah, I know, this is your favorite science fact. - in pepto-bismol is metal.

762
00:49:05,760 --> 00:49:06,260
Yeah.

763
00:49:06,260 --> 00:49:08,480
Well, I mean, bismuth metal looks fucking tight.

767
00:49:15,080 --> 00:49:17,080
That's weird.

768
00:49:17,080 --> 00:49:19,160
Is that like one of those colloidal silver--

769
00:49:19,160 --> 00:49:20,880
Okay, but I will say, this--

770
00:49:20,880 --> 00:49:24,680
When it says, "This article outlines seven health benefits of selenium,

771
00:49:24,680 --> 00:49:26,120
all backed by science,"

772
00:49:26,120 --> 00:49:28,880
when you put "all backed by science" in it, I don't believe you anymore.

773
00:49:28,880 --> 00:49:29,380
Mm-hmm.

774
00:49:29,380 --> 00:49:34,740
Yeah, it was just benefit. One, it makes the morgulons very angry. Two, it makes the morgulons very sad.

775
00:49:34,740 --> 00:49:38,380
Helps prevent mental decline.

776
00:49:38,380 --> 00:49:41,220
That's what I would try to do if I had a thing like that.

777
00:49:41,220 --> 00:49:43,780
I would try to conduct psychic warfare on the morgulons.

778
00:49:43,780 --> 00:49:48,180
I would try to just like punish my skin as much as possible to make them leave. Yeah.

779
00:49:48,180 --> 00:49:55,100
Yeah, yeah, just getting like in motorcycle accidents every other day. Yeah, dude. I just fucking I do all sorts of fucked-up shit.

848
00:56:26,800 --> 00:56:32,160
character, he would be like, he'd be like one of those like, traitors that gets fucked over by like

849
00:56:32,160 --> 00:56:37,600
the Mandalorian. Like one of those like, where he like, like two scenes later, like, like the

853
00:56:46,560 --> 00:56:48,560
[Gibberish]

He's like reptilian, like he looks like

855
00:56:50,560 --> 00:56:52,560

and he's just like, "Urg, de wa do da!"

857
00:56:54,560 --> 00:56:56,560
Those are the real losers of the Star Wars

858
00:56:56,560 --> 00:56:58,560
universe, the people who dare to have a

859
00:56:58,560 --> 00:57:00,560
shop in the way of the-

860
00:57:00,560 --> 00:57:02,560
It's so sick that they do that in every

861
00:57:02,560 --> 00:57:04,560
movie, dude, there's just

862
00:57:04,560 --> 00:57:06,560
a guy who gets his ship blown up and goes

863
00:57:06,560 --> 00:57:08,560
[Gibberish]

864
00:57:08,560 --> 00:57:10,560
Some fucking frog monkey

865
00:57:10,560 --> 00:57:14,540
Monkey who gets his like like bowls of slime broken

866
00:57:14,540 --> 00:57:20,720
Fucking hates the Jedi in the prequels

867
00:57:20,720 --> 00:57:32,420
Just like at least the stitches like walk around and act like evil

868
00:57:32,420 --> 00:57:37,040
Thing that the Sith do is raise a fucking tariff

869
00:57:37,040 --> 00:57:49,520
yeah it's a Greek guy just yelling some Greek guy with four arms they just

870
00:57:49,520 --> 00:57:53,880
fucking open the door to like to like a hot like one of those hot dog stands and

871
00:57:53,880 --> 00:58:02,400
get inside and just start doing the maze the goat flip inside and just it is yeah

872
00:58:02,400 --> 00:58:05,440
it's like the the scene that you sometimes see in movies with like

873
00:58:05,440 --> 00:58:07,160
somebody is like having a fight in a

874
00:58:07,160 --> 00:58:09,120
bathroom or something and they kick open

875
00:58:09,120 --> 00:58:10,920
a stall and there's like a guy reading

876
00:58:10,920 --> 00:58:13,160
the paper it's that but they do it

877
00:58:13,160 --> 00:58:15,800
every single fucking movie. There's at least one

878
00:58:15,800 --> 00:58:18,080
fucking person like that in every Star

879
00:58:18,080 --> 00:58:20,000
Wars movie especially the prequel. Some alien

880
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:22,040
whose livelihood is ruined by it. Or like it's

881
00:58:22,040 --> 00:58:23,680
like a droid it's like a droid that like

882
00:58:23,680 --> 00:58:26,360
they accidentally power off. Yeah. Yeah

883
00:58:26,360 --> 00:58:28,400
that's why Wado is such a powerful

884
00:58:28,400 --> 00:58:30,000
character is because he finally takes

885
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:32,960
control. Yeah he's like he I think it's

886
00:58:32,960 --> 00:58:38,440
like the Hutts it's like the Hutts no the Toydarians and then like as soon as Pat

887
00:58:38,440 --> 00:58:42,920
looks up and to think harder about Star Wars I know that I'm in like humongous

888
00:58:42,920 --> 00:58:47,480
trouble yeah yeah when you're like I'm like you're like I can't even like have

889
00:58:47,480 --> 00:58:50,840
any visual stimuli that interrupts my star right train of thought right now

890
00:58:50,840 --> 00:58:55,880
because every train of thought if I look at something I have to look up because if

891
00:58:55,880 --> 00:59:00,960
I look at anything else I will fuck in I will think about that other thing it's

892
00:59:00,960 --> 00:59:05,280
just you you know there's ibuprofen there's ibuprofen on my desk if I looked

893
00:59:05,280 --> 00:59:07,760
at that while I was thinking about it I would think well think about all the

894
00:59:07,760 --> 00:59:14,480
morgulons on your body yeah exactly exactly oh fuck but yeah the Hutts and

895
00:59:14,480 --> 00:59:17,840
the Toridarians so those are like the two and they both live on or at least

896
00:59:17,840 --> 00:59:22,040
Jabba lives on Tatooine and so does Wado so Tatooine if you if you hey if you're a

897
00:59:22,040 --> 00:59:26,320
Jedi looking a looking to get looking for a challenge head to Tatooine head to

898
00:59:26,320 --> 00:59:30,120
most nicely tattooing rack

899
00:59:30,120 --> 00:59:31,960
it is so sick that that's like

900
00:59:31,960 --> 00:59:35,160
i guess i would just are worse that's just like what good guys do

901
00:59:35,160 --> 00:59:36,320
in movies

902
00:59:36,320 --> 00:59:39,520
it's like the bad guys kill people in the good guys like walk around in like

903
00:59:39,520 --> 00:59:42,040
smash clay pots to find coins inside

904
00:59:42,040 --> 00:59:43,560
like that's just

905
00:59:43,560 --> 00:59:45,220
that's what you're supposed to do

906
00:59:45,220 --> 00:59:48,920
you're supposed to cause damage to civilian you're supposed to hear supposed

907
00:59:48,920 --> 00:59:49,560
to like

908
00:59:49,560 --> 00:59:54,540
skid your car down the street and like almost run over a

909
00:59:54,540 --> 00:59:56,780
a small child or an old lady.

910
00:59:56,780 --> 01:00:00,940
And then you don't, but you knock a water tower onto a guy's like,

911
01:00:00,940 --> 01:00:03,780
like a fucking halal cart.

912
01:00:03,780 --> 01:00:07,420
Yeah, yeah, Kermit the Frog's halal cart.

913
01:00:07,420 --> 01:00:08,820

01:00:26,540 --> 01:00:30,700
Alright, the Morglons are attacking me right now.
