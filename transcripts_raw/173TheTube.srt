1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,580
(upbeat music)

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:12,160
- All right, notice anything different about me?

3
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:14,100
- You're gray sweatshirt challenge.

4
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:16,880
- He's wearing fucking pajama pants here.

5
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:20,320
- Sissy, you wear a gray, no, it's not that.

6
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:21,160
- What the hell?

7
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:22,000
- He's wearing pajama pants.

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,480
- You are, bro, what the fuck?

9
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:25,600
- He doesn't treat this job like it's a fucking thing.

10
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:28,120
- And you have a stain on your nipple from your lactation.

11
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:31,560
We have a very serious dress code.

12
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:32,400
And it, go change.

13
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:33,220
- Yeah, what is it?

14
00:00:33,220 --> 00:00:34,060
- Go change.

15
00:00:34,060 --> 00:00:34,880
- Black on black on black.

16
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:35,720
- Go change right now.

17
00:00:35,720 --> 00:00:37,000
Put on real pants.

18
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:37,840
- Uh-huh. - Okay.

19
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:41,200
- What was that?

20
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:42,800
- I was gonna maybe, I could snap.

21
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:44,360
- And plus we have a one drink limit,

22
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:46,080
so you have to throw one of those away right now.

23
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:48,520
- What the fuck is wrong with you today?

24
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:49,720
- I don't give a fuck 'cause I had--

25
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:50,560
- He doesn't give a--

26
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:51,380
- And he just checked his phone.

27
00:00:51,380 --> 00:00:52,800
He turned his phone on and was looking at it.

28
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:53,640
- This is what it's like dealing with me, isn't it?

29
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:55,520
- All right, scrap the episode, it's over.

30
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:56,360
- This is what it's like--

31
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:58,600
You guys are being babies.

32
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:00,680
(static)

33
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:03,140
- You could, why don't we have the whole setup

34
00:01:03,140 --> 00:01:03,980
with the computer?

35
00:01:03,980 --> 00:01:04,800
- Yeah.

36
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:07,360
- Why not just do it on the, this makes zero sense.

37
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:09,880
- You can suck my, oh, is this, are you sad?

38
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:13,280
- That was pretty good.

39
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:14,120
- That was really good.

40
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:15,960
- So don't come for me today, okay?

41
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:18,440
I had, I got two hours of sleep because I drank

42
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:20,720
an extra strong coffee ice cube.

43
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:21,760
- Oh no.

44
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:22,600
- Yeah, so.

45
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:23,440
- You were supposed to go.

46
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:24,880
- You might not wanna mess with me.

47
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:26,320
- Noah just moved in.

48
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:29,760
We were supposed to go out and then he said,

49
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:31,360
no way am I going out.

50
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:34,040
Meanwhile, he stays up till four in the morning or something.

51
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:37,400
- I didn't know that I had a disease that made me sensitive.

52
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:40,240
I've become so sensitive to caffeine that I can have,

53
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:41,760
I'll have four sips of this coffee.

54
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:42,600
I'm scared to even have one right now.

55
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:43,680
- You know what that is?

56
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:44,520
- What?

57
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:45,600
- We're syncing up.

58
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:46,760
- I was thinking about that.

59
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:48,080
I think you and me are syncing up.

60
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:50,200
I also feel like maybe I've gotten a little smarter

61
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:52,000
and you've gotten a tad bit stupider.

62
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:52,960
(laughing)

63
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:55,680
- I think we've been syncing up for a while.

64
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:58,120
- Yeah, you're not syncing up with anyone yet.

65
00:01:58,120 --> 00:01:59,560
- Yeah, it'll take a while for me to sync up.

66
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:01,500
- It is coming though.

67
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:03,080
- So if you start speaking Spanish,

68
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:04,640
I think we'll know who he's syncing up with

69
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:06,360
or spending time with.

70
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:07,200
- Donde?

71
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:12,120
That is fucking Spanish right there.

72
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:13,320
- I never listened to Donde, was that good?

73
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:14,920
- Hola cabrones.

74
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:16,800
Yo soy, yo soy.

75
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:17,960
- Don't call me a cabrone.

76
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:18,960
- Yo soy muerto.

77
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:20,000
- You pendejo.

78
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:20,840
- Whoa.

79
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:21,880
- Me llamo muerto.

80
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:22,960
- You pendejo.

81
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:24,160
- You can't say that about me.

82
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:25,360
- Me llamo muerto.

83
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:26,200
- Ooh.

84
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:28,840
- Where, you're dead?

85
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:30,300
- I am death.

86
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:31,660
That's my name is death.

87
00:02:31,660 --> 00:02:33,100
- You're not death.

88
00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:34,300
- Mm-hmm.

89
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:36,200
- Well, you're just hovering your finger over the--

90
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:37,460
- That's 'cause you never know when I--

91
00:02:37,460 --> 00:02:39,360
(laughing)

92
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:40,760
Never know.

93
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:41,600
Give me any topic.

94
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:43,400
- That's why it's your new phone.

95
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:45,400
- Oh, that was actually the number one thing

96
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:48,520
I wanted to start with was that I got a new phone.

97
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:51,320
- It blew up just now.

98
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:54,200
- No, that's just like any time you say something awesome,

99
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:55,360
you press that button.

100
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:56,240
- All right, try this one.

101
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:58,040
- You know, I--

102
00:02:58,040 --> 00:02:58,880
- Brah.

103
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:03,960
- I gave Caleb my old phone and it was the,

104
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:04,800
it still had camera access to it.

105
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:07,400
- I broke it in a week.

106
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:09,120
- He loves, that phone is gonna be gone within two days.

107
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:10,680
- No, that phone is like--

108
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:11,880
- It's toast.

109
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:15,440
- He has no case on it, no screen protector.

110
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:17,480
Actually, you do have a screen protector.

111
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:19,720
(laughing)

112
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:21,600
- Fuck you, bitch ass.

113
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:24,560
I'm gonna break every phone I ever have.

114
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:26,400
I don't even know how you do it.

115
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:27,200
Dropping.

116
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:28,240
You drop it a bunch?

117
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:30,200
Hold it up in front of stuff and drop it.

118
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:32,840
I would stand up at the aquarium to take a picture,

119
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:35,160
and I'd get on some guy's shoulder, get real high up

120
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:38,200
to take a picture of a very tall fish, and then I'd drop it.

121
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:40,360
I dropped my phone probably 7,000 times.

122
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:41,480
The phone that I gave him--

123
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:42,320
And I only broke it 6,000 times.

124
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:43,480
But I've never had a case of a single phone over that.

125
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:45,440
This was the last phone that I had that could still use

126
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:46,640
CamWow for the iPhone.

127
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:47,520
Except for this one.

128
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:48,080
Remember that?

129
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:48,440
Remember the CamWow?

130
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:49,320
And I shattered it.

131
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:51,520
He shattered it into a million fucking pieces.

132
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:53,320
I fucking destroyed that phone.

133
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:55,480
- He had like a phone that had the screen was hanging out.

134
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:59,760
- I have an old iPhone that's in my house,

135
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:01,320
I'm never gonna give it to him.

136
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:02,160
- My phone had a--

137
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:03,760
- He's gonna beg for it next week.

138
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:04,600
(laughing)

139
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:06,440
- The phone Patrick gave me,

140
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:08,760
I somehow, I've never seen another phone do this.

141
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:10,740
By the end, it's in my desk.

142
00:04:10,740 --> 00:04:13,160
It has a hole dead in the middle of the screen

143
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:15,200
where you can see all the way through.

144
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:17,160
It looked like you can see like the CPU

145
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:18,160
through the middle of the phone.

146
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:19,000
- How did you do that?

147
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:19,960
- I don't know, man.

148
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:21,220
- He's trying to fuck his phone.

149
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:22,220
I must...

150
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:24,780
You have no respect for technology.

151
00:04:24,780 --> 00:04:26,300
Yeah, you wish you had a soundboard.

152
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:34,100
He made a hole in the middle of the phone screen and then he looked up lube app.

153
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:35,700
Lube app to make phones slippery.

154
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:37,900
No, but I was downloading all the old...

155
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:39,100
And the vibration app.

156
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:42,380
Okay, I was downloading all the old apps onto my phone.

157
00:04:42,380 --> 00:04:45,780
I was looking through all the apps that I've bought over the years and there was five different

158
00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:51,180
vibrating massage apps that I guess at some point I downloaded.

159
00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:53,740
- Not even gonna touch that one.

160
00:04:53,740 --> 00:04:55,260
- But I don't know, I don't remember.

161
00:04:55,260 --> 00:04:56,100
- He was trying to touch that one.

162
00:04:56,100 --> 00:04:56,920
- I'm guessing it was--

163
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:58,020
- He was trying to touch his one.

164
00:04:58,020 --> 00:04:59,860
- I'm guessing it was for a joke,

165
00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:01,380
'cause that sounds very funny.

166
00:05:01,380 --> 00:05:02,900
- Yeah, that does sound like something.

167
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:03,740
- But if you do--

168
00:05:03,740 --> 00:05:04,620
- That was not a joke on you.

169
00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:07,700
- But I don't know really if it was a joke.

170
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:08,540
- Yeah, I don't think it was.

171
00:05:08,540 --> 00:05:10,100
- I might have been putting the corner of an iPhone,

172
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:11,900
and this was back when they had sharp corners.

173
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:13,420
I might have been putting the corner of my iPhone

174
00:05:13,420 --> 00:05:14,740
right in my ass.

175
00:05:14,740 --> 00:05:16,460
- They never had sharp corners.

176
00:05:16,460 --> 00:05:18,860
- Not, yeah, okay, rich kid, you had the S,

177
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:20,660
you had the smooth version of every iPhone.

178
00:05:20,660 --> 00:05:22,480
No, I'm just thinking about the iPod Touch.

179
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:24,480
Remember when the first kid got the first iPod Touch?

180
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:25,620
It had a 90 degree angle.

181
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:26,460
Oh yeah.

182
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:27,360
No, it was rounded.

183
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:28,100
Nope.

184
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:28,700
It was rounded.

185
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:29,580
Then you guys are the rich kids.

186
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:31,940
You saw the very first one that I never even saw.

187
00:05:31,940 --> 00:05:32,580
Exactly.

188
00:05:32,580 --> 00:05:33,420
Beveled.

189
00:05:33,420 --> 00:05:34,180
Beveled.

190
00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:34,580
Nope.

191
00:05:34,580 --> 00:05:35,260
It was beveled.

192
00:05:35,260 --> 00:05:36,220
Never had a sharp horn.

193
00:05:36,220 --> 00:05:37,060
Never was sharp.

194
00:05:37,060 --> 00:05:37,980
No, no, no.

195
00:05:37,980 --> 00:05:39,740
Beveled.

196
00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:40,460
You're wrong.

197
00:05:40,460 --> 00:05:43,140
I'm right.

198
00:05:43,140 --> 00:05:46,340
Whatever sound you're about to play applies to you and not me.

199
00:05:46,340 --> 00:05:47,900
The next sound you play is about you.

200
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:49,940
Guys, I don't want to use a soundboard.

201
00:05:49,940 --> 00:05:51,940
I don't want to use...

202
00:05:51,940 --> 00:05:54,940
I'm Micah Jackson and I'll be telling you to pick up your phone, Shimon.

203
00:05:54,940 --> 00:05:57,940
I'm a smooth, invisible, pickin' up phone motherfucker.

204
00:05:57,940 --> 00:05:59,940
Truth my best elf, that's right.

205
00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:02,940
What the fuck was that?

206
00:06:02,940 --> 00:06:03,940
What was that?

207
00:06:03,940 --> 00:06:07,940
Why did you open up voice memos and play that?

208
00:06:07,940 --> 00:06:11,940
I don't want to use the soundboard on you guys.

209
00:06:11,940 --> 00:06:14,940
I want to use it to lampoon events and news.

210
00:06:14,940 --> 00:06:16,940
Let's think of some stuff to lampoon.

211
00:06:17,940 --> 00:06:19,940
Give me something to have a take.

212
00:06:19,940 --> 00:06:21,940
Oh there's some big murder trial.

213
00:06:21,940 --> 00:06:23,940
Oh the Murdaw?

214
00:06:23,940 --> 00:06:25,940
Yeah, the murder murders.

215
00:06:25,940 --> 00:06:27,940
Yeah, buddy if you didn't want to go to jail. He's in there lying so he doesn't go to jail.

216
00:06:27,940 --> 00:06:29,940
Buddy if you didn't want to go to jail,

217
00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:31,940
maybe don't kill your entire fucking family.

218
00:06:31,940 --> 00:06:33,940
[Gunshot]

219
00:06:33,940 --> 00:06:35,940
That's what he did, yeah.

220
00:06:35,940 --> 00:06:37,940
He didn't explode them.

221
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:39,940
And here's another thing.

222
00:06:39,940 --> 00:06:41,940
Ice Spice. You seen this girl?

223
00:06:41,940 --> 00:06:43,940
This is what your music sounds like.

224
00:06:43,940 --> 00:06:45,940
No, Ice Spice.

225
00:06:45,940 --> 00:06:47,940
No. Ice Spice, here's a new...

226
00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:49,840
You're not in control.

227
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:53,620
Ice Spice, your new music video with Pink Pantheress,

228
00:06:53,620 --> 00:06:55,740
you dress, you look like a toddler.

229
00:06:55,740 --> 00:06:57,680
And this is what your music sounds like.

230
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:59,860
You ruined my point, you fucking asshole.

231
00:06:59,860 --> 00:07:01,420
She DM'd me last night.

232
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:02,780
Ice Spice, you look...

233
00:07:02,780 --> 00:07:05,180
Why is she dressed like a toddler in that music video?

234
00:07:05,180 --> 00:07:06,380
Look what Ice Spice said to me.

235
00:07:06,380 --> 00:07:08,380
She says, "How are you doing

236
00:07:08,380 --> 00:07:10,220
and how is life treating you, beautiful face?

237
00:07:10,220 --> 00:07:12,620
I always see you liking my page, pics, and comments.

238
00:07:12,620 --> 00:07:14,460
Thanks so much. One more time again.

239
00:07:14,460 --> 00:07:17,020
and please always be good.

240
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:18,180
- Tell her right now. - Oh my God.

241
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:20,700
- Say, hey, put your belly button back

242
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:23,260
in your fucking shirt, you hoe.

243
00:07:23,260 --> 00:07:25,260
- I said, "Hello, Ice Spice, do you love music?"

244
00:07:25,260 --> 00:07:29,300
And then she said, "You should know what I love, fans,

245
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:30,660
"and how are you doing?

246
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:32,600
"I'm very pleased to read a line from you.

247
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:34,140
"I sent you a follow request here

248
00:07:34,140 --> 00:07:36,920
"because I see you always liking my posts and uploads.

249
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:39,360
"Thank you for your continuous love and support.

250
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:41,880
"How long since have you been my fan

251
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:43,260
"and been listening to my music?"

252
00:07:43,260 --> 00:07:45,380
and I said I love music and singing.

253
00:07:45,380 --> 00:07:47,380
And she said, yeah you should, Mr. Patrick.

254
00:07:47,380 --> 00:07:48,740
Music is life. - Mr. Patrick.

255
00:07:48,740 --> 00:07:50,780
- Bro, you are fine. - Dude, I have,

256
00:07:50,780 --> 00:07:54,220
I learned recently that I have undeniable riz.

257
00:07:54,220 --> 00:07:56,300
- Ice Spice is DMing you and you're saying,

258
00:07:56,300 --> 00:07:58,020
I love music, what do you say,

259
00:07:58,020 --> 00:08:00,380
fucking give me some pussy?

260
00:08:00,380 --> 00:08:02,580
- No, yeah, Mr. Patrick.

261
00:08:02,580 --> 00:08:03,660
- Yeah, Mr. Patrick.

262
00:08:03,660 --> 00:08:05,780
She's talking to you. - That's your nickname.

263
00:08:05,780 --> 00:08:07,420
- Mr. Patrick.

264
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:09,040
- Noah already calls me that. - Yeah, my name's Patrick,

265
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:10,980
but a lot of people call me Mr. Patrick.

266
00:08:10,980 --> 00:08:12,980
- Whoa, you got new buttons on that soundboard.

267
00:08:12,980 --> 00:08:14,300
- You have so many buttons.

268
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:15,140
- Holy crap.

269
00:08:15,140 --> 00:08:15,980
- Help me, Carl.

270
00:08:15,980 --> 00:08:18,220
(laughing)

271
00:08:18,220 --> 00:08:22,900
- You know, you gotta do this once a year.

272
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:23,940
That's how I feel.

273
00:08:23,940 --> 00:08:26,700
You need to do something like this once every single year.

274
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:27,520
- The soundboard?

275
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:28,540
- Yeah.

276
00:08:28,540 --> 00:08:30,460
Yeah, just one time every year.

277
00:08:30,460 --> 00:08:31,540
Just somebody has to do it.

278
00:08:31,540 --> 00:08:33,940
And this year, because my mental capacities

279
00:08:33,940 --> 00:08:36,120
are definitely neutered because of how many hours

280
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:37,940
of sleep I got, especially REM sleep.

281
00:08:37,940 --> 00:08:39,620
- Can I tell you guys something too?

282
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:40,980
I also--

283
00:08:40,980 --> 00:08:42,600
- You put him to sleep.

284
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:45,320
I'm also not operating at 100% today.

285
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:45,820
Yeah.

286
00:08:45,820 --> 00:08:48,860
I'm actually hella stressed out because,

287
00:08:48,860 --> 00:08:50,160
and I think I already told you guys this,

288
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:53,240
but my driving instructor just broke up with her boyfriend.

289
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:54,320
Dude, I saw that shit.

290
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:54,820
Wait, hold on.

291
00:08:54,820 --> 00:08:56,400
I saw that shit on the news.

292
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:58,440
My driving instructor just broke up with her boyfriend.

293
00:08:58,440 --> 00:08:59,740
It's got me stressed out.

294
00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:02,740
I play like bruh.

295
00:09:02,740 --> 00:09:05,120
Or like womp womp womp.

296
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:06,360

297
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:07,240
Bruh.

298
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:08,040
B-R-U-H.

299
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:08,620
Wait, hold on.

300
00:09:08,620 --> 00:09:10,000
Oh, I got it.

301
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:10,700
Say it again.

302
00:09:10,700 --> 00:09:13,920

00:09:33,020 --> 00:09:34,500
you think that's a gun

309
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:39,140
yet you don't know what a gun sounds like

310
00:09:39,140 --> 00:09:40,140
How is that not a gun?

311
00:09:40,140 --> 00:09:42,220
- That was an, those were two different sounds.

312
00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:44,420
- Somebody reloading a gun and then it exploded?

313
00:09:44,420 --> 00:09:46,020
- No, I have explosion.

314
00:09:46,020 --> 00:09:47,620
Let me run you through what I have.

315
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:49,300
- Well yeah, 'cause you only used one.

316
00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:50,740
Now what I know you have.

317
00:09:50,740 --> 00:09:52,380

318
00:09:52,380 --> 00:09:53,940
- Here's gun.

319
00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:55,620
(gun firing)

320
00:09:55,620 --> 00:09:56,460
They're different.

321
00:09:56,460 --> 00:09:57,500
(laughing)

322
00:09:57,500 --> 00:09:58,340
- They are different.

323
00:09:58,340 --> 00:09:59,160
- How could I not tell the difference?

324
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:00,000
- They are very different.

325
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,300
- Yeah, they're pretty different.

326
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:02,560
- What else do you got on here?

327
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:04,340
- Man, fuck you, just keep going

328
00:10:04,340 --> 00:10:05,980
and I will show you what I have.

329
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:07,620
- I'm more intrigued with the soundboard.

330
00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:12,340
Yeah, you can't just act like it's not here. You have to really run through it.

331
00:10:12,340 --> 00:10:14,620
I do have Fun Sounds Volume 42.

332
00:10:14,620 --> 00:10:17,940
If we can't even see it, you gotta just go.

333
00:10:17,940 --> 00:10:19,140
You guys wanna see the soundboard?

334
00:10:19,140 --> 00:10:20,740
You just have to do something with it.

335
00:10:20,740 --> 00:10:22,340
Wait, you really wanna see the soundboard?

336
00:10:22,340 --> 00:10:23,340

Fuck you.

See, that's what I'm talking about.

00:10:28,220 --> 00:10:33,620
Do you wanna hear anything from Fun Sounds 42 with swearing Indian on it?

340
00:10:33,620 --> 00:10:35,420
Wait, I...

341
00:10:35,420 --> 00:10:37,140
Can you do it again?

342
00:10:37,140 --> 00:10:41,480
Okay, that's scary. I don't like that. I'm gonna uninstall this

343
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:49,120
You can't do multiple of these I'm drawing a hard line

I'm going to have to use my face ID to open up my phone right after I say it. And it'll

351
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:33,380
take me 30 seconds. It'll be a delayed explosion because I closed my phone, but I'm fine with

00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:54,740
Okay, I kind of like that one. But that's your last one. I'm cutting you off. You of

358
00:11:54,740 --> 00:11:58,660
all, of all three of us, actually including Jubio, you're the last person... You dangled

359
00:11:58,660 --> 00:12:01,140
the soundboard in front of me. You're the last, you're the last person. You dangled the

360
00:12:01,140 --> 00:12:06,440
I said no because I had it dude. Yeah, do you you're coveting thy neighbors?

361
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:09,680
But I am come on boy. Are you kidding suck my balls? Are you kidding me?

362
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:13,660
I would love to have a sound boy a fable called keeping up with the pits is

363
00:12:13,660 --> 00:12:21,120
And oh, yeah rolls you can not everybody can get what what the pits is have actually fucking beautiful

364
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:23,320
Yeah that actually solved this whole thing

365
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:30,740
Instantly solved that yeah, I you've ever watched keeping up with the Kardashians and try to keep up with them

366
00:12:30,740 --> 00:12:32,740
Oh my god first of all himself

367
00:12:32,740 --> 00:12:35,620
I

368
00:12:35,620 --> 00:12:41,140
Fucking knew that you were gonna reach for the sound immediately. Yeah, wait keeping up with the Kardashians. You got an edge

369
00:12:41,140 --> 00:12:43,140
It's pretty easy because they're fat

370
00:12:43,140 --> 00:12:48,580
That would have been would have been funny without it you ruined it

371
00:12:48,580 --> 00:12:52,580
Yeah, it would have been funnier with a difference. It would have been funny if you did a fist bump instead of the sound

372
00:12:56,820 --> 00:13:02,640
No, I'm not giving you anything. It's nothing that was not good. What if I did it without even looking

373
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:12,380
What if I seriously did it without even looking yeah, cuz I'm so good at the soundboard do it. I don't have to look

374
00:13:12,380 --> 00:13:14,780
nice

375
00:13:14,780 --> 00:13:19,560
You're this is how he breaks his fucking phones all the time. You have heavy fingers. Don't you?

376
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:22,340
fuck

377
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:27,940
I didn't, this is a long one too.

378
00:13:27,940 --> 00:13:30,780
All right, well, just close that, turn that.

379
00:13:30,780 --> 00:13:31,620
There you go.

380
00:13:31,620 --> 00:13:33,940
(laughing)

381
00:13:33,940 --> 00:13:36,460
All right, let's talk about our lives.

382
00:13:36,460 --> 00:13:38,260
Let's talk about things that have happened in our lives

383
00:13:38,260 --> 00:13:39,420
since we last spoke.

384
00:13:39,420 --> 00:13:40,260
- Oh!

385
00:13:40,260 --> 00:13:43,140
- And I'm gonna finally take the first sip of my coffee.

386
00:13:43,140 --> 00:13:45,620
- I'm no longer in Bushwick, Brooklyn.

387
00:13:45,620 --> 00:13:47,260
- My driving instructor's boyfriend

388
00:13:47,260 --> 00:13:49,340
did not get her flowers.

389
00:13:49,340 --> 00:13:50,180
- Oh yeah.

390
00:13:50,180 --> 00:13:51,000
- On Valentine's Day.

391
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,840
- Wait, wait, did she explain, so tell me how--

392
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:54,680
- So here's the drama.

393
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:56,520
Tell me. Give me the tea.

394
00:13:56,520 --> 00:13:59,640
She, on Valentine's Day, she said her and her boyfriend

395
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:01,680
were not doing something for Valentine's Day.

396
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:03,760
I was like, "Oh, really? That sucks. I'm sorry."

397
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:08,760
And she was like, "No, it's okay. He was in the hospital."

398
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:10,320
Yeah, hospital.

399
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:11,160
Yeah.

400
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:12,000
He was in the hostel.

401
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:12,820
And that's what I-

402
00:14:12,820 --> 00:14:15,120
Getting sucked off in the Red Lake District in Amsterdam.

403
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:19,120
Yesterday, the song "Flowers" came on the radio.

404
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:21,680
♪ I can buy myself flowers ♪

405
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:24,040
And then she was dancing like this.

406
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:25,760
- While she's instructing you?

407
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:26,600
- Yeah.

408
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:28,520
- Well, I know what to do.

409
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:29,360
- Oh yeah.

410
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:30,560
- So she's just not like driving.

411
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:32,880
- Hey, you can do that when you're in the passenger seat.

412
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:34,240
- But doesn't she have her own wheel

413
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:35,440
and her own steering brake?

414
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:36,280
- Just a brake.

415
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:37,100
- Oh, okay.

416
00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:38,160
- She doesn't have her own wheel?

417
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:39,000
- No.

418
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:39,820
- Did that ever exist?

419
00:14:39,820 --> 00:14:40,660
- They had a--

420
00:14:40,660 --> 00:14:41,500
- That's probably impossible.

421
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:42,640
- I was in 21 Jump Street.

422
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:47,640
- The driving instructor I had in 2013

423
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:49,840
had a wheel, he had a Prius with two wheels on it.

424
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:52,040
- So you had a driving instructor 10 years ago,

425
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:53,880
Still can't, 10 years of driving.

426
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:54,720
Still can't drive.

427
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:56,040
- Well I dropped out, I dropped out of that class.

428
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:58,620
I've talked about that driving instructor before.

429
00:14:58,620 --> 00:14:59,460
- What do you--

430
00:14:59,460 --> 00:15:00,640
- The guy who rates all the babies.

431
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:02,240
- Yeah, you've talked about him a lot.

432
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:05,160
- Yeah, it's the funniest thing ever.

433
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:07,800
- What is the thing for you that's so hard about driving?

434
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:10,320
- I don't know, we don't have to get into it on the show.

435
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:11,160
- Why?

436
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:16,160
- I don't wanna talk over his driving instructor's boyfriend.

437
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:17,920
- He's scared of traffic cones.

438
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:20,360
- Yeah, traffic cones are the scariest part.

439
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:23,280
He thinks it's candy corn that his car wants to eat,

440
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:24,600
and he starts going, "Doo doo doo doo,"

441
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:26,600
eating all of them, driving right over.

442
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:28,720
- His driving instructor is going through

443
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:31,160
a fucking hard time, and you wanna talk about me?

444
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:32,760
- Did she, okay, I hate to ask.

445
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:33,840
- So wait, I didn't, I'm sorry.

446
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:35,400
- She's dancing.

447
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:36,600
- Yeah. - Singing.

448
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:38,080
- Flowers.

449
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:39,560
- I don't know the rest of the words.

450
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:41,360
- I don't know the words of it.

451
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:43,360
She said the, I can buy, yeah.

452
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:44,680
So she, that's, well that makes sense,

453
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:46,560
because she said, "I can buy myself flowers,"

454
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:47,960
and then she turned to me and she said,

455
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:50,280
"I have to buy myself flowers

456
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:52,240
"'cause my boyfriend didn't get me any flowers.

457
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:53,480
"Yeah, we broke up."

458
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:54,480
- Shit.

459
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:55,640
- And I said, "Oh, I'm so sorry."

460
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:56,640
And she said, "Yeah."

461
00:15:56,640 --> 00:15:58,440
And then I didn't understand what she said after that

462
00:15:58,440 --> 00:15:59,960
'cause she doesn't speak English so well.

463
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:01,200
- Oh, man.

464
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:04,560
- Isn't that really hard?

465
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:05,400
- It's kinda cringe.

466
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:06,240
- It's tragic.

467
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:07,240
Really, you think so?

468
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:08,080
- A little cringe.

469
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:10,040
- Oh, I guess I shouldn't have brought it up.

470
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:11,680
- It's cringe for your driving instructor.

471
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:13,560
- Some irony bros like you guys probably.

472
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:15,040
- It's kinda cringe for a part.

473
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:18,240
I'm actually all new sincerity and shit.

474
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:21,480
And I'm post-ironic now.

475
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:26,040
And I think that, honestly, we should have your driving instructor on so we can like...

476
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:27,080
She would love to.

477
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:28,160
...teach her how to like...

478
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:29,960
She would love to.

479
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:31,000
...give her like a makeover.

480
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:31,840
I want a new...

481
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:32,240
There you'll be.

482
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:33,160
She doesn't need a makeover.

483
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:33,600
She dresses...

484
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:36,480
Every item of her clothing has Mickey Mouse on it.

485
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:37,480
Really?

486
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:40,560
Mickey Mouse shirt, Mickey Mouse pants, Mickey Mouse backpack, Mickey Mouse sweatshirt.

487
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:41,640
You know who she reminds me of?

488
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:43,320
Literally, completely Mickey Mouse.

489
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:44,600
We know who she looks like.

490
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:44,920
Who?

491
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,880
Mickey Mouse.

492
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:47,680
Explosion.

493
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:48,180
Oh.

494
00:16:48,180 --> 00:16:48,680
Fuck.

495
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:50,960
What we do, we get her in here, right?

496
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:51,460
Yeah.

497
00:16:51,460 --> 00:16:52,640
With a surgeon.

498
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:53,140
OK.

499
00:16:53,140 --> 00:16:56,400
Surgically graft her ears to the top of her head.

500
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:58,000
Yeah, I like where this is going.

501
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:58,640
Right?

502
00:16:58,640 --> 00:16:59,960
You've piqued my interest.

503
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:03,600
Then we get her maybe like some back fat or something,

504
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:05,720
or like some body part.

505
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:09,400
We can elongate her nose maybe a little bit.

506
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:10,640
Does Mickey have a long nose?

507
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:11,240
Mickey's got a--

508
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:12,800
He's got a circle for a nose, right?

509
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:13,800
Yeah, it's not a long--

510
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:14,720
He doesn't have a nose like this.

511
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:15,720
I think he has a Pinocchio.

512
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:18,680
Okay, but you think a human has a Mickey nose?

513
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:20,200
But it would have to be smaller to be a Mickey.

514
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:21,920
Yeah, yeah, we're closing off this part.

515
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:25,360
I saw a guy with a Mickey Mouse nose on the street the other day and he looked like a

516
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:26,360
monster.

517
00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:27,360
Really?

518
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:31,280
I saw a guy this morning, I saw a guy this morning, just moved into my new neighborhood

519
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:36,120
and I walked, walking down the street, this guy is covered in like dollar store like beads

520
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:37,120
and stuff.

521
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:40,200
He's wearing like a green top hat with like shit all around it.

522
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:41,200
Leprechaun.

523
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:42,200
And he has two bags.

524
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:43,200
Oh, I know that guy.

525
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:45,880
I was like this motherfucker is about to give me a quest.

526
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:47,400
- Did he have-- - I know.

527
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:49,400
I know that something crazy is about to come.

528
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:50,840
- Was he playing music?

529
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:51,680
- No, he wasn't playing music.

530
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:53,320
- No, that guy plays music usually

531
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:55,440
and he switches between--

532
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:56,640
- I think it was too early in the morning.

533
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:57,720
- Sometimes he's Irish,

534
00:17:57,720 --> 00:17:59,840
but sometimes he's full American flag suit.

535
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:01,000
- Yeah? - Nice.

536
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,480
- And he walks down the street, he plays music.

537
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:05,240
- He looked incredible. - Last Friday night.

538
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:06,280
- He's an old guy? - Yeah.

539
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:07,740
- Yeah, he's the man.

540
00:18:07,740 --> 00:18:09,040
Yeah, and he'll walk in the stores

541
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:11,200
and he pays for stuff with just coins.

542
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:12,040
Damn.

543
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:14,240
pervert lives on my street is three feet tall.

544
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:20,440
I didn't know Caleb moved in on your street.

545
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:25,440
If I had the soundboard that would have been fucking sick.

546
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:26,440
Too bad you don't man.

547
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:27,540
Too bad you don't.

548
00:18:27,540 --> 00:18:28,840
How do you know that he's three feet tall?

549
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:29,740
As I see him.

550
00:18:29,740 --> 00:18:30,940
Oh, I mean the other way.

551
00:18:30,940 --> 00:18:31,840
How do you know he's a pervert?

552
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:33,640
Took a picture of my girlfriend.

553
00:18:41,340 --> 00:18:45,100
through the window. No, he's standing on the sidewalk and he went like...

554
00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:47,900
Did you try to...

555
00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:50,140
Well, there's just something...

556
00:18:50,140 --> 00:18:52,300
Did you see him or did she tell you?

557
00:18:52,300 --> 00:18:55,660
No, I saw him like at the last second and there was something in my brain where I was

558
00:18:55,660 --> 00:18:56,620
like, "I can't...

559
00:18:56,620 --> 00:18:57,100
Yeah.

560
00:18:57,100 --> 00:18:58,140
No, you can't beat...

561
00:18:58,140 --> 00:18:58,380
I can't...

562
00:18:58,380 --> 00:19:00,380
Even if he's a pervert, he's three feet tall, you can't beat him up.

563
00:19:00,380 --> 00:19:04,620
Yeah, I can't say... Well, I wasn't going to beat him up. I was always... I can't be

564
00:19:04,620 --> 00:19:08,460
like... I feel like even in my brain, there's a block against being like, "Hey, man, what

565
00:19:08,460 --> 00:19:09,660
- What the fuck is wrong with you?

566
00:19:09,660 --> 00:19:11,380
You can't say what the fuck is wrong with you

567
00:19:11,380 --> 00:19:12,740
to a guy who's three feet tall.

568
00:19:12,740 --> 00:19:14,300
- Especially 'cause maybe he was doing--

569
00:19:14,300 --> 00:19:16,420
- Specifically that phrasing is very dangerous.

570
00:19:16,420 --> 00:19:19,540
- Especially, dude, the worst thing ever would be,

571
00:19:19,540 --> 00:19:22,420
he's like, right, you yell at him, right?

572
00:19:22,420 --> 00:19:24,020
You yell in the back of his head,

573
00:19:24,020 --> 00:19:26,620
he turns around, he has a Google Maps shirt on,

574
00:19:26,620 --> 00:19:29,900
and he's taking a whole stream of photos, right?

575
00:19:29,900 --> 00:19:33,140
- Yeah, he's adding, making an add-on for Google Maps

576
00:19:33,140 --> 00:19:35,180
where it shows little pins on all the girls

577
00:19:35,180 --> 00:19:36,020
who live in the neighborhood.

578
00:19:36,020 --> 00:19:36,840
- Yeah. - Exactly.

579
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:38,320
- Or you can click restaurants at the top

580
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:40,080
and you go to the side and you can click girls.

581
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:42,880
- Girls should be chipped like dogs.

582
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:45,200
We should be able to track them wherever they go.

583
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:47,760
- You should be able to buy girls in a bag like chips.

584
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:48,600
- Yep, or like goldfish.

585
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:51,040
- Yeah, but no, there'd be too much air.

586
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:51,880
There would just be way too much--

587
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:52,720
- What the hell, there's only one girl.

588
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:55,240
- They should be in tubes like Pringles.

589
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:57,440
- Yeah, that would remove the air problem.

590
00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:00,360
- Females, buy a female in a tube, right?

591
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:03,840
You go to a whole, you go to a store and they have--

592
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:05,840
- I hate these, the fucking female tubes are too small

593
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:06,680
to get my hand into.

594
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:09,400
- Women in tubes like the motherfucking

595
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:11,160
wands in Harry Potter.

596
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:12,000
- Yeah.

597
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,340
- Oh, it has to fall off the shelf

598
00:20:14,340 --> 00:20:16,120
and roll towards you like that chef

599
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:16,960
from a barbeque commercial.

600
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:18,920
- And then you go to pick one

601
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:20,160
and the guy at the store's like,

602
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:21,600
"No, you can't pick one.

603
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:23,520
"That one belonged to the Dark Lord."

604
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:24,360
- Oh my God.

605
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:25,680
- And it was Hitler's girlfriend.

606
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:26,520
- Ava Brown.

607
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:27,360
- It's Ava Brown.

608
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:29,200
- Oh, you guys know her name?

609
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:30,400
- Yeah, she's fucking hella hot.

610
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:31,240
- He said it first.

611
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:32,080
- No, you said it first.

612
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:32,920
- Did I?

613
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:34,480
(laughing)

614
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:35,520
- Ah, rats.

615
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:39,960
You guys got baited. I would never claim to remember anything about Hitler.

616
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:42,960
I don't even remember what he looks like, and I'm going to the barber later.

617
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:47,960
[laughter]

618
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:51,460
Yeah. So that's pretty awesome. He had a pervert encounter.

619
00:20:51,460 --> 00:20:53,960
Yeah. It was a while ago. I just remembered it now.

620
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:57,960
Did you look up family watchdog after?

621
00:20:57,960 --> 00:21:00,960
Let me see if I can find the tiny...

622
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:02,460
I don't know what family watchdog is.

623
00:21:02,460 --> 00:21:06,260
Oh, there's a site that he knows cuz he's got Google alerts on first name. Oh

624
00:21:06,260 --> 00:21:17,180
It's not working any minute now there's a website my money man any minute no he didn't know how to turn his phone volume up

625
00:21:17,180 --> 00:21:26,060
I gotta give you that one. Yeah, I just panicked and I hit my name Jeff

626
00:21:26,060 --> 00:21:32,300
Sorry, it's a website where you can see all the perverts in your neighborhood. Yeah, I didn't know about it

627
00:21:32,300 --> 00:21:33,820
- Yeah, my mom looked it up

628
00:21:33,820 --> 00:21:35,340
'cause there was a guy in my neighborhood

629
00:21:35,340 --> 00:21:37,300
who kept trying to talk to me about comic books.

630
00:21:37,300 --> 00:21:40,420
- Oh yeah. - That's called a fuckin' nerd.

631
00:21:40,420 --> 00:21:42,460
- They should have a nerd registry.

632
00:21:42,460 --> 00:21:44,540
- Nerd registry. - I agree.

633
00:21:44,540 --> 00:21:48,060
Nerds, you should have to register as a nerd.

634
00:21:48,060 --> 00:21:48,900
- I hate nerds. - You're going around

635
00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:50,540
the neighborhood with like--

636
00:21:50,540 --> 00:21:52,540
- I just wanted to know.

637
00:21:52,540 --> 00:21:54,420
- The court is legally required.

638
00:21:54,420 --> 00:21:56,220
- I am an nerd. - I regret to inform you

639
00:21:56,220 --> 00:21:57,700
that-- - I'll be up till 3 a.m.

640
00:21:57,700 --> 00:22:01,260
every night studying. - The court has ascertained

641
00:22:01,260 --> 00:22:05,740
that I must be not allowed within three feet of a bookstore.

642
00:22:05,740 --> 00:22:08,060
- He only gets one word out at a time

643
00:22:08,060 --> 00:22:10,420
and the doors just keep closing on him over and over again

644
00:22:10,420 --> 00:22:12,720
until he says the sentence, I only.

645
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:16,180
- That would be good in a movie or TV show.

646
00:22:16,180 --> 00:22:18,460
- That's how I think because I've seen so many of them.

647
00:22:18,460 --> 00:22:20,220
- Yeah, you think in movies and TV?

648
00:22:20,220 --> 00:22:22,740
- Give me any scenario and I'll write a script right now.

649
00:22:22,740 --> 00:22:23,740
- Okay.

650
00:22:23,740 --> 00:22:26,940
- I'm basically a writer bot.

651
00:22:26,940 --> 00:22:31,220
- Three friends sitting at a gray table with microphones.

652
00:22:31,220 --> 00:22:35,220
Fade in. Three friends sitting at a table.

653
00:22:35,220 --> 00:22:36,220
Fade in.

654
00:22:36,220 --> 00:22:37,220
A gray table.

655
00:22:37,220 --> 00:22:38,220
Gray table.

656
00:22:38,220 --> 00:22:39,220
With microphones that are gray, pink, and green.

657
00:22:39,220 --> 00:22:41,220
Sorry, are you the writer bot or am I?

658
00:22:41,220 --> 00:22:43,220
Yes. Well, you have to get the input.

659
00:22:43,220 --> 00:22:44,220
Yeah.

660
00:22:44,220 --> 00:22:45,220
Yeah, so I'm giving you the scenario that you asked.

661
00:22:45,220 --> 00:22:47,220
And they're wearing headphones, black headphones and pink headphones.

662
00:22:47,220 --> 00:22:50,220
Okay, I changed the entire thing. Swipe up.

663
00:22:50,220 --> 00:22:51,220
Swipe up.

664
00:22:51,220 --> 00:22:52,220
Swipe up.

665
00:22:52,220 --> 00:22:53,220
Swipe up.

666
00:22:53,220 --> 00:22:55,220
You see three friends are sitting at a gray table.

667
00:22:55,220 --> 00:22:57,220
Their microphones are different shades.

668
00:22:57,220 --> 00:22:59,220
One blue, one pink, one green.

669
00:22:59,220 --> 00:23:00,220
What?

670
00:23:00,220 --> 00:23:02,820
each representing their personality.

671
00:23:02,820 --> 00:23:04,180
- This one's gray.

672
00:23:04,180 --> 00:23:06,620
- One of them seems very tired.

673
00:23:06,620 --> 00:23:08,180
- That's more of a periwinkle.

674
00:23:08,180 --> 00:23:11,580
- What?

675
00:23:11,580 --> 00:23:12,420
- That is more of a periwinkle than a gray.

676
00:23:12,420 --> 00:23:14,080
- Well that's just gray.

677
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:15,580
I thought it was blue.

678
00:23:15,580 --> 00:23:17,140
I thought that was blue until you put it

679
00:23:17,140 --> 00:23:18,860
next to the gray thing. - Maybe I'm color blind.

680
00:23:18,860 --> 00:23:20,980
- That's the exact same color as the wall.

681
00:23:20,980 --> 00:23:23,900
Wow, doesn't that look a little blue against his white skin?

682
00:23:23,900 --> 00:23:27,500
- Yeah, no, it's like that.

683
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:28,540
- It's not that color.

684
00:23:28,540 --> 00:23:29,380
- It's not periwinkle, no.

685
00:23:29,380 --> 00:23:30,760
It is pretty much periwinkle.

686
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:32,040
Okay, well, my movie's over.

687
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:33,040
That's a pretty good movie.

688
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:34,540
I guess my movie's fucking over.

689
00:23:34,540 --> 00:23:35,540
Yeah, good.

690
00:23:35,540 --> 00:23:37,580
Well, we actually just wrote the script, didn't we?

691
00:23:37,580 --> 00:23:39,060
I just got the...

692
00:23:39,060 --> 00:23:40,700
It bombed at the box office as well.

693
00:23:40,700 --> 00:23:41,700
It was a huge bomb.

694
00:23:41,700 --> 00:23:43,040
It's not gonna get a sequel?

695
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:44,780
And I'm never gonna work in this town again.

696
00:23:44,780 --> 00:23:48,200
No, you could work in Branson, Missouri or something.

697
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:52,100
We should go do spaghetti podcasting in Italy.

698
00:23:52,100 --> 00:23:53,100
That is such a good idea.

699
00:23:53,100 --> 00:23:55,420
Isn't that the best idea I've ever had right now?

700
00:23:55,420 --> 00:23:56,780
Okay, where it's all dubbed over.

701
00:23:56,780 --> 00:23:58,780
We change the...

702
00:23:58,780 --> 00:24:01,780
Oh wait, you meant like spaghetti western.

703
00:24:01,780 --> 00:24:04,780
[Laughter]

704
00:24:04,780 --> 00:24:06,780
I'm open to either.

705
00:24:06,780 --> 00:24:11,780
I thought that you meant we go to a restaurant with this in the middle of the table.

706
00:24:11,780 --> 00:24:13,780
And we just slurp noodles.

707
00:24:13,780 --> 00:24:15,780
And we eat a bunch of...

708
00:24:15,780 --> 00:24:17,780
That already exists, it's a mukbang.

709
00:24:17,780 --> 00:24:20,780
What's that big... what's the... is it Ketchup... Kakao I Pepe?

710
00:24:20,780 --> 00:24:21,780
Ketchup.

711
00:24:21,780 --> 00:24:23,780
Ketchup I Pepe.

712
00:24:23,780 --> 00:24:27,580
The one where you eat it out of the big wheel of cheese?

713
00:24:27,580 --> 00:24:28,580
The big wheel.

714
00:24:28,580 --> 00:24:29,580
Yeah.

715
00:24:29,580 --> 00:24:34,540
We just get a big one of those and we eat just spaghetti the whole episode.

716
00:24:34,540 --> 00:24:35,540
That would hurt.

717
00:24:35,540 --> 00:24:37,500
I have some kind of gluten intolerance.

718
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:38,500
Something happened to me.

719
00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:40,540
Okay, we can get chickpea pasta.

720
00:24:40,540 --> 00:24:41,540
That stuff sucks.

721
00:24:41,540 --> 00:24:44,580
And he's like, what was he, like 20% Italian?

722
00:24:44,580 --> 00:24:46,780
He's allergic to pasta?

723
00:24:46,780 --> 00:24:48,180
Yeah, because I'm...

724
00:24:48,180 --> 00:24:49,780
His own ancestors hate him.

725
00:24:49,780 --> 00:24:50,780
Oh, yeah.

726
00:24:50,780 --> 00:24:51,780
I could have told you that.

727
00:24:51,780 --> 00:24:52,780
That's way too far.

728
00:24:52,780 --> 00:24:54,420
(laughing)

729
00:24:54,420 --> 00:24:56,060
- Hey man.

730
00:24:56,060 --> 00:24:58,620
- We don't like talking shit about ancestors on this show.

731
00:24:58,620 --> 00:25:01,580
- Leave my, say what everyone about my body,

732
00:25:01,580 --> 00:25:03,980
talk about my current, talk about my immediate family,

733
00:25:03,980 --> 00:25:07,620
my beloved, my betrothed, my future children.

734
00:25:07,620 --> 00:25:09,820
But if you talk shit about my ancestors,

735
00:25:09,820 --> 00:25:11,900
we're gonna have a serious problem.

736
00:25:11,900 --> 00:25:12,740
We're gonna have a real fucking problem.

737
00:25:12,740 --> 00:25:16,880
- Well your future children are gonna have brown teeth.

738
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:19,580
I know that for a fact.

739
00:25:19,580 --> 00:25:21,300
- You know what that's called?

740
00:25:21,300 --> 00:25:24,440
♪ Evolution ♪

741
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:25,620
- Korn.

742
00:25:25,620 --> 00:25:28,460
♪ It's evolution ♪

743
00:25:28,460 --> 00:25:29,880
♪ Evolution ♪

744
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:30,720
- What?

745
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:32,160
- Yeah, that's another part of the same song.

746
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:33,480
♪ Celebrate ♪

747
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:34,320
- That was a different song.

748
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:35,140
- That song sucks.

749
00:25:35,140 --> 00:25:35,980
- Evolution?

750
00:25:35,980 --> 00:25:36,820
- Yeah.

751
00:25:36,820 --> 00:25:37,640
- Yeah, that's probably their worst song.

752
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:38,480
- That album is so bad.

753
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:39,320
- Korn is just terrible.

754
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:42,480
- Is that the one, what album did that come off of?

755
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:43,480
Untitled?

756
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:44,320
- Jesus, that's how you know it's bad.

757
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:46,040
- That was the one where they started having--

758
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:47,400
- They didn't even want to give it a title.

759
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:50,080
- There basically was a Christian invasion into Korn.

760
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:52,080
Oh monkey or head right?

761
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:54,080
Well now also I think monkey is too.

762
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:55,080
Wow.

763
00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:57,080
Someone else and now there's two of them.

764
00:25:57,080 --> 00:25:59,080
They wrote all those songs about getting molested.

765
00:25:59,080 --> 00:26:01,080
No that was actually, that album,

766
00:26:01,080 --> 00:26:04,080
Untitled, not sorry to be a corn historian here,

767
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:06,080
that was actually the Christian Exodus.

768
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:08,080
That was when the Christian guy left the band.

769
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:10,080
They made that album and it sucked.

770
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:12,080
And then he came back and it was good again.

771
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:15,080
So big surprise, the Christians were actually the glue

772
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:17,080
holding together the entire group.

773
00:26:17,080 --> 00:26:19,080
Like some podcasts.

774
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:21,820
(laughing)

775
00:26:21,820 --> 00:26:24,200
- Like some podcast where if the Christian left,

776
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:25,620
it would be a disaster.

777
00:26:25,620 --> 00:26:26,680
- Uh-huh.

778
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:27,520
- Who knows?

779
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:29,000
- We don't have a name Christian.

780
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,760
- Yeah, I guess it's Jubio.

781
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:33,640
- Jubio's Catholic, doesn't count.

782
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:35,680
They go directly to hell.

783
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:36,960
They don't even get judged.

784
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:39,300
Yes they do, they worship a false idol, Mary.

785
00:26:39,300 --> 00:26:42,560
- And Pippin.

786
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:44,240
Mary and Pippin.

787
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:45,080
Lord of the Rings.

788
00:26:45,080 --> 00:26:46,720
- We're hitting it out of the park today.

789
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:47,560
We're knocking--

790
00:26:47,560 --> 00:26:51,660
I'm destroying, I'm crushing, I have a soundboard.

791
00:26:51,660 --> 00:26:52,880
- You have a crutch. - First of all.

792
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:54,580
- You have a crutch with that soundboard

793
00:26:54,580 --> 00:26:56,520
and then I tried to do what you're doing.

794
00:26:56,520 --> 00:26:58,240
- You're like a-- - 'Cause I'm also tired

795
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:00,000
'cause I had to help Noah move in last night.

796
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,440
- Sorry, wait, how many hours of sleep did you get?

797
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:03,520
Did it end with an O?

798
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:06,840
- Oh, did either of you guys have a trauma

799
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:09,820
within the group, the person that you see twice a week?

800
00:27:09,820 --> 00:27:10,900
Did that happen to either of you?

801
00:27:10,900 --> 00:27:11,960
No, I don't fucking think so.

802
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:13,360
So, Jalel. - No, no.

803
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:14,240
- Shut the fuck up.

804
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:15,080
- Yeah, we need to listen to him.

805
00:27:15,080 --> 00:27:16,980
- You've never had a driving instructor breakup.

806
00:27:16,980 --> 00:27:19,060
His driving instructor is going through a very hard time.

807
00:27:19,060 --> 00:27:20,940
Do you know how long I have to be in the car with her

808
00:27:20,940 --> 00:27:22,140
while she's been broken up?

809
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:23,700
45 fucking minutes.

810
00:27:23,700 --> 00:27:24,540
Oh my fucking god.

811
00:27:24,540 --> 00:27:25,360
Two days a week.

812
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:28,100
Do you know how long the car that I learned to drive in was?

813
00:27:28,100 --> 00:27:28,940
This big.

814
00:27:28,940 --> 00:27:29,780
10 feet, it was a limo.

815
00:27:29,780 --> 00:27:30,600
You are a molecule.

816
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:31,820
He learned in a limo.

817
00:27:31,820 --> 00:27:32,660
I learned how to drive.

818
00:27:32,660 --> 00:27:33,500
He learned in a limo.

819
00:27:33,500 --> 00:27:35,020
That's how fucking terrible I am at driving.

820
00:27:35,020 --> 00:27:37,820
Look, that's why he's dressed up like his day off.

821
00:27:37,820 --> 00:27:38,660
His day off.

822
00:27:38,660 --> 00:27:40,500
He's supposed to be in a tuxedo right now.

823
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:41,340
I've been walking around, I keep my keys.

824
00:27:41,340 --> 00:27:42,620
'Cause he doesn't have his car today.

825
00:27:42,620 --> 00:27:43,620
I asked him for a ride in,

826
00:27:43,620 --> 00:27:45,540
'cause we're lunch buddies now, we're neighbors.

827
00:27:45,540 --> 00:27:47,460
- Why are you talking such hello fucking shit

828
00:27:47,460 --> 00:27:48,900
on my clothes, bro?

829
00:27:48,900 --> 00:27:50,860
- You're wearing disgusting work

830
00:27:50,860 --> 00:27:53,620
and you got stains on your clothes, bro.

831
00:27:53,620 --> 00:27:55,260
- Guys. - People look at us now.

832
00:27:55,260 --> 00:27:56,420
- Okay, how long-- - This could've been,

833
00:27:56,420 --> 00:27:59,820
this shit could've flew like six months ago.

834
00:27:59,820 --> 00:28:02,140
- How long have you guys known me?

835
00:28:02,140 --> 00:28:03,460
- 10 years. - Probably four years.

836
00:28:03,460 --> 00:28:04,980
- Four years, right?

837
00:28:04,980 --> 00:28:05,820
And when are you guys gonna get it?

838
00:28:05,820 --> 00:28:06,660
- I've known him for 10 years.

839
00:28:06,660 --> 00:28:09,180
- When are you gonna get it through your thick, thick skulls?

840
00:28:09,180 --> 00:28:10,460
- He hasn't known me for 10 years,

841
00:28:10,460 --> 00:28:11,500
but I've known him for 10 years.

842
00:28:11,500 --> 00:28:12,820
- Get it through your thick skulls.

843
00:28:12,820 --> 00:28:15,380
I don't give a fuck about anything,

844
00:28:15,380 --> 00:28:17,940
because I'm amazingly cool.

845
00:28:17,940 --> 00:28:19,980
So stuff like this doesn't matter to me at all.

846
00:28:19,980 --> 00:28:20,820
You guys dressed up.

847
00:28:20,820 --> 00:28:21,660
- I got some of your coffee.

848
00:28:21,660 --> 00:28:24,380
- You guys look like you are working for a band,

849
00:28:24,380 --> 00:28:26,380
backstage moving speakers,

850
00:28:26,380 --> 00:28:28,180
and I look like what?

851
00:28:28,180 --> 00:28:29,620
The lead guitarist.

852
00:28:29,620 --> 00:28:30,620
- You don't look like the lead,

853
00:28:30,620 --> 00:28:33,060
you look like the guy there not letting into the van,

854
00:28:33,060 --> 00:28:34,140
'cause he smells too bad.

855
00:28:34,140 --> 00:28:36,380
(laughing)

856
00:28:36,380 --> 00:28:41,540
Somehow you smell bad enough to not get let into the--

857
00:28:41,540 --> 00:28:42,380
- You can have the rest of that, it's kind of hurtful.

858
00:28:42,380 --> 00:28:44,660
- To the metalcore show.

859
00:28:44,660 --> 00:28:46,540
- You have a metalcore, it's your heart.

860
00:28:46,540 --> 00:28:50,480
- Yeah, hard, cold as iron, no mercy.

861
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:52,040
- That's why you-- - 'Cause I don't give a fuck.

862
00:28:52,040 --> 00:28:55,500
- Became so rude to me in the last recent episode

863
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:56,340
that we were doing.

864
00:28:56,340 --> 00:28:58,540
- That was really good.

865
00:28:58,540 --> 00:29:00,100
- And if you ever wanted to see me

866
00:29:00,100 --> 00:29:03,420
snap a lid off of a bottle, today's your day.

867
00:29:03,420 --> 00:29:05,100
Bye.

868
00:29:05,100 --> 00:29:06,580
- Snap a lid off of a bottle?

869
00:29:06,580 --> 00:29:09,100
- Somebody didn't go to fucking my school.

870
00:29:09,100 --> 00:29:10,620
- Somebody didn't go to my school.

871
00:29:10,620 --> 00:29:16,460
That was see now. He's got coffee in him. It's just in his hands. You know he's feeling radiating energy coming off of this guy

872
00:29:16,460 --> 00:29:19,380
He's like a fucking that people do the thing at you got a red eye

873
00:29:19,380 --> 00:29:25,260
Where you pop the you got a water bottle you you twist it and then you jump on and it shoots the cap

874
00:29:25,260 --> 00:29:30,160
You know we used to that shit was so sick. You know we used to do was kill animals with yeah, we

875
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:36,340
You know the hood milk cartons like the little tiny well

876
00:29:36,340 --> 00:29:39,740
I don't know why I thought hoods the only one that made those well

877
00:29:39,740 --> 00:29:44,180
It's like you know it's cool. No you guys know that hood is just a New England. Yeah, I know that that's so we

878
00:29:44,180 --> 00:29:46,380
I didn't know that yeah, yeah like that like the

879
00:29:46,380 --> 00:29:48,460
hood see

880
00:29:48,460 --> 00:29:54,660
These yeah, what Walberg talks about Boston slang, and he's like oh a hood see that's just like a little tub of ice cream

881
00:29:54,660 --> 00:29:58,320
Yeah, I didn't know I thought I thought that's a girl. I didn't dick

882
00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:04,000
I didn't realize until this very second that I haven't seen a hood see since I haven't seen a hood see cup in

883
00:30:04,620 --> 00:30:06,460
- That's crazy. - Going back to Boston

884
00:30:06,460 --> 00:30:08,860
for the same patties though. - The little wooden stick.

885
00:30:08,860 --> 00:30:10,020
We should get some hoodsies.

886
00:30:10,020 --> 00:30:11,660
- We gotta go get some hoodsie coats.

887
00:30:11,660 --> 00:30:12,820
(laughing)

888
00:30:12,820 --> 00:30:14,860
Dude, I want that strawberry one.

889
00:30:14,860 --> 00:30:16,140
I'm thinking about that right now.

890
00:30:16,140 --> 00:30:20,420
- Sitting at the bar drinking Guinness, eating hoodsies.

891
00:30:20,420 --> 00:30:23,020
- I'll stick with my frozen yogurt, thank you very much.

892
00:30:23,020 --> 00:30:25,940
- Dude, a hoodsie and a Kelly's roasted beef sandwich.

893
00:30:25,940 --> 00:30:27,580
(laughing)

894
00:30:27,580 --> 00:30:29,780
And also we're in Boston fitted,

895
00:30:29,780 --> 00:30:31,740
Boston fitted Celtics sweatshirt,

896
00:30:31,740 --> 00:30:33,660
or Patriots sweatshirt, Celtics.

897
00:30:33,660 --> 00:30:35,060
I'm in my Bruins PJs.

898
00:30:35,060 --> 00:30:37,420
- Bruins PJ pants, Celtics sandals.

899
00:30:37,420 --> 00:30:41,220
- Yeah, and you're eating hot cross buns.

900
00:30:41,220 --> 00:30:43,620
- You don't get it, you don't understand.

901
00:30:43,620 --> 00:30:45,740
Yeah, hot cross buns are a big thing in Boston.

902
00:30:45,740 --> 00:30:47,260
- Whatever happened to hot cross buns?

903
00:30:47,260 --> 00:30:49,260
I feel like I used to hear that song all the time

904
00:30:49,260 --> 00:30:51,700
in elementary school and I never hear it anymore.

905
00:30:51,700 --> 00:30:52,540
- It was a one-hit wonder.

906
00:30:52,540 --> 00:30:53,860
- It fell off.

907
00:30:53,860 --> 00:30:54,700
- I don't know who made that,

908
00:30:54,700 --> 00:30:56,620
it was probably Akon or something,

909
00:30:56,620 --> 00:30:58,780
but definitely people don't listen to that shit anymore.

910
00:30:58,780 --> 00:31:00,740
- Yeah, sounds like a damn Lil Yachty song.

911
00:31:00,740 --> 00:31:03,860
Yeah, when I say put on that old school.

912
00:31:03,860 --> 00:31:04,900
That's what I'm talking about.

913
00:31:04,900 --> 00:31:06,060
Yeah, put on that old school.

914
00:31:06,060 --> 00:31:08,380
Camp town races, ooh!

915
00:31:08,380 --> 00:31:09,220
Damn.

916
00:31:09,220 --> 00:31:10,980
I hear camp town races pretty often.

917
00:31:10,980 --> 00:31:11,820
Yeah, that was my song.

918
00:31:11,820 --> 00:31:13,340
Well, it's 'cause you're always on a carousel.

919
00:31:13,340 --> 00:31:14,180
Yeah.

920
00:31:14,180 --> 00:31:16,100
That's your driving school.

921
00:31:16,100 --> 00:31:17,940
(laughing)

922
00:31:17,940 --> 00:31:18,780
On a carousel.

923
00:31:18,780 --> 00:31:23,180
Yeah, I guess Hot Cross Buns is every other kid's song

924
00:31:23,180 --> 00:31:24,140
you'll hear once in a while

925
00:31:24,140 --> 00:31:26,540
'cause it's an ice cream truck song or a carousel

926
00:31:26,540 --> 00:31:30,280
or it's in a TV show, but Hot Cross Buns sucks enough

927
00:31:30,280 --> 00:31:33,640
that you will never hear it again after you learn to play the piano the first time.

928
00:31:33,640 --> 00:31:34,920
You learn it on the recorder.

929
00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:35,420
Yeah.

930
00:31:35,420 --> 00:31:37,600
That is until you guys come to my daughter's wedding

931
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:39,120
and it's the daddy-daughter dance.

932
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:41,040
[LAUGHTER]

933
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:43,480
[HUMMING]

934
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:48,320
Literally the worst song of all time.

935
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:49,280
Just sobbing.

936
00:31:49,280 --> 00:31:52,000
Just like, you have mascara on and it's going--

937
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,400
I can't believe I'm giving away my baby girl.

938
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:57,320
--running down your face.

939
00:31:57,320 --> 00:31:59,800
And it's played on the recorder by your nephew.

940
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:10,520
It's becoming so funny to me to say Hot Cross Buns is the worst song of all time because it's true.

941
00:32:10,520 --> 00:32:11,020
It has to be.

942
00:32:11,020 --> 00:32:13,020
It's literally the worst song ever.

943
00:32:13,020 --> 00:32:16,300
It's the worst song that qualifies as a song.

944
00:32:16,300 --> 00:32:16,800
Yeah.

945
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:18,800
It has an original melody.

946
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:19,800
I fucking hate that song.

947
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:21,160
But it is terrible.

948
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:22,600
Well, that's the thing.

949
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:27,560
You lot of people haven't heard the 12 inch remix or the 12 inch 12 inch dance

950
00:32:27,560 --> 00:32:32,000
mix of hot cross buns. Hot cross buns has to be the only one of those songs that

951
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:37,440
nobody's nobody's ever mixed by. Nobody's ever like we got to hop on hot

952
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:37,800
cross.

953
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:45,160
We need to get OVO for to do hot cross buns. They fucked it up. What do you

954
00:32:45,160 --> 00:32:46,360
think that song's about?

955
00:32:49,240 --> 00:32:51,840
One a penny, two a penny, even the lyrics.

956
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:55,040
We need the rap genius verified on Hot Cross Buns.

957
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:58,520
Hot Cross Buns, one a penny, two a penny, Hot Cross Buns.

958
00:32:58,520 --> 00:33:01,040
I didn't know that it was one a penny, two a penny.

959
00:33:01,040 --> 00:33:04,240
I just thought it was hot, hot, hot.

960
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:05,240
Get that ready.

961
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:06,240
Get that ready.

962
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:07,240
Wait, hold on.

963
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:08,240
Hot Cross Buns, lyric, what, who?

964
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:09,240
Give him a second.

965
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:10,240
Yeah, give me a second.

966
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:11,240
Wait, are you ready yet?

967
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:12,240
He's a mad.

968
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:13,840
Hot Cross Buns, who wrote the lyrics for this song?

969
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:14,840
Lil Pump.

970
00:33:14,840 --> 00:33:17,100
(laughing)

971
00:33:17,100 --> 00:33:19,840
- Fuck, doesn't that feel good?

972
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:20,680
- It does feel pretty good.

973
00:33:20,680 --> 00:33:22,440
- It's like an amazing punctuation, dude.

974
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:23,920
- Oh man.

975
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:25,240
- Yeah, but that song sucks dick.

976
00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:26,080
- We're basically in the--

977
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:28,280
- I never wanna hear that song again in my life.

978
00:33:28,280 --> 00:33:32,800
- In the lunchroom, we used to take the hood milk cartons

979
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:37,080
and if you fold the tip of it into itself

980
00:33:37,080 --> 00:33:39,240
and you just get it real flat on top

981
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:41,560
and you just fucking slam down on it,

982
00:33:41,560 --> 00:33:43,200
it sounds like a gunshot.

983
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:44,040
- That's pretty cool, yeah.

984
00:33:44,040 --> 00:33:49,040
Just do that in the cafeteria and scare the fuck out of everyone damn. Yeah, we're crazy now

985
00:33:49,040 --> 00:33:56,120
I'm imagining don't you hate when?

986
00:33:56,120 --> 00:34:02,440
Y'all kids were motherfucking crazy

987
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:10,640
Don't you guys hate when you get in the you get in the uber and the uber that they're playing rap music

988
00:34:10,640 --> 00:34:13,520
and then the Uber driver gives you a look in the rear view

989
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:16,320
and then switches the playlist and starts playing Hot Cross Buns.

990
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:18,320
(laughter)

991
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:22,640
You know what else we used to do in middle school that reminds me of that

992
00:34:22,640 --> 00:34:25,040
is you ever do the thing where you had "get ready"?

993
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:25,540
I got you.

994
00:34:25,540 --> 00:34:29,040
You take paper towels or toilet paper and you get them really wet

995
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:31,040
and you throw them up on the ceiling of the bathroom.

996
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:33,040
(rap music)

997
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:34,320
(laughter)

998
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:35,520
That shit was so sick.

999
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:36,480
Yeah, we're different back then.

1000
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:40,000
When people found out how to do that and it just went so over people.

1001
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,400
Every time someone would go to the bathroom,

1002
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:42,880
they'd throw like six of them up there,

1003
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:45,480
and they're just like 100 slimes

1004
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:47,240
on the ceiling of every bathroom.

1005
00:34:47,240 --> 00:34:49,040
- I wonder if I've talked about this before,

1006
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:51,880
but in eighth grade, we found out

1007
00:34:51,880 --> 00:34:53,640
that you could take the mirrors off the wall

1008
00:34:53,640 --> 00:34:54,480
in the bathroom.

1009
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:56,740
(laughing)

1010
00:34:56,740 --> 00:34:58,640
- Like they were just hanging?

1011
00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:02,080
- No, you could just, if you pushed up on one,

1012
00:35:02,080 --> 00:35:04,740
the mirrors in the eighth grade hallway,

1013
00:35:04,740 --> 00:35:06,160
you could just pull them off the wall

1014
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:07,920
'cause they were just shitty and old.

1015
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:10,140
So it was a growing problem.

1016
00:35:10,140 --> 00:35:12,400
They had like a meeting with everybody

1017
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:14,440
and they were like, if you take those mirrors,

1018
00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:16,240
like you just take them off

1019
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:18,860
and then hide them in a stall or something.

1020
00:35:18,860 --> 00:35:20,560
Or like take the mirror off

1021
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:24,000
and then just put it like behind the trash can, not in it.

1022
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,640
And we just kept taking the fucking mirrors off.

1023
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:28,320
And all like, just, if you fuck,

1024
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:30,280
if we see the mirror gone one more time,

1025
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:34,080
none of you are going on the eighth grade DC field trip.

1026
00:35:34,080 --> 00:35:35,940
It is not fucking happening.

1027
00:35:35,940 --> 00:35:36,840
- That's so sick.

1028
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:38,760
- I still get worried every once in a while

1029
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:39,880
when I look up to the ceiling

1030
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:41,320
and kind of in my peripheral vision

1031
00:35:41,320 --> 00:35:43,720
think I see one of those sticky hands

1032
00:35:43,720 --> 00:35:45,280
just stuck there forever.

1033
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:47,720
You know, 'cause those would just never come down.

1034
00:35:47,720 --> 00:35:49,680
- Those leave a stain. - I ruined my family's wall.

1035
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:50,520
- Yeah.

1036
00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:56,560
I ruined my family's wall. (laughing)

1037
00:35:56,560 --> 00:35:58,000
- How?

1038
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:58,960
- With the sticky hand?

1039
00:35:58,960 --> 00:35:59,800
- Oh, yeah.

1040
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:03,960
- Mom, I ruined the wall with the sticky hand.

1041
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:06,840
My sticky hand ruined your wall, ma.

1042
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:07,680
Sorry.

1043
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:08,600
It did though.

1044
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:09,440
Yeah.

1045
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:10,260
It was a hand print.

1046
00:36:10,260 --> 00:36:11,100
I got a sticky--

1047
00:36:11,100 --> 00:36:12,040
It's like slapping a woman's ass.

1048
00:36:12,040 --> 00:36:14,360
I got a sticky hand at Dave and Buster's last time I went.

1049
00:36:14,360 --> 00:36:15,200
I got some from the dentist several times.

1050
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:17,000
Or a second the last time I went.

1051
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:19,520
You got sticky hand from the dentist?

1052
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:20,360
Damn.

1053
00:36:20,360 --> 00:36:22,440
That's hot.

1054
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:23,600
I'm never going to the dentist again.

1055
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:26,680
I keep thinking you're gonna like have a sound ready.

1056
00:36:26,680 --> 00:36:28,240
Yeah, you're just browsing.

1057
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:30,080
You're just doing Instagram but with the sound board.

1058
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:32,040
Hey, Jubia, do you have anything to say?

1059
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:37,040
Just say one single thing for me.

1060
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:38,040
No.

1061
00:36:38,040 --> 00:36:39,040
[Music]

1062
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:40,040
[Laughter]

1063
00:36:40,040 --> 00:36:41,040
Got him.

1064
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:42,040
That's very rude.

1065
00:36:42,040 --> 00:36:43,040
[Laughter]

1066
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:44,040
That's not nice.

1067
00:36:44,040 --> 00:36:45,040
[Laughter]

1068
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:46,040
Julio, you have the power to soundboard him whenever.

1069
00:36:46,040 --> 00:36:47,040
But you can't, you don't actually have the power.

1070
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:48,040
You have the power to soundboard Caleb into a position.

1071
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:49,040
I'm a professional.

1072
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:50,040
You're not a professional.

1073
00:36:50,040 --> 00:36:51,040
You're afraid of my sound.

1074
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:52,040
I am.

1075
00:36:52,040 --> 00:36:53,040
You're afraid of my sound.

1076
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:54,040
You're afraid of my sound.

1077
00:36:54,040 --> 00:36:55,040
You're afraid of my sound.

1078
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:56,040
You're afraid of my sound.

1079
00:36:56,040 --> 00:36:57,040
You're afraid of my sound.

1080
00:36:57,040 --> 00:36:58,040
You're afraid of my sound.

1081
00:36:58,040 --> 00:36:59,040
You're afraid of my sound.

1082
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:00,040
You're afraid of my sound.

1083
00:37:00,040 --> 00:37:01,040
You're afraid of my sound.

1084
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:04,660
I think you are afraid.

1085
00:37:04,660 --> 00:37:05,920
You're afraid.

1086
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:06,920
You're too afraid.

1087
00:37:06,920 --> 00:37:08,600
You're typing gay with two A's.

1088
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:09,600
Gay sex videos.

1089
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:12,600
No, do not play gay sex porn videos.

1090
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:13,600
Because I'm going to get horny.

1091
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:17,400
Actually, some of those looked okay.

1092
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:18,600
Explosion sound right now.

1093
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:22,200
See, if I had it as a physical board.

1094
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:30,680
We need more sound effects and more like, you know when you see somebody is starting

1095
00:37:30,680 --> 00:37:35,320
a podcast for the first time and they've spent a lot of money on a little studio in their

1096
00:37:35,320 --> 00:37:40,860
apartment and they have a soundboard that they keep pressing whenever somebody says something,

1097
00:37:40,860 --> 00:37:42,480
we need to revert back into that.

1098
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:43,680
That's so sick, man.

1099
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:47,840
We need to make this look like it's the first time we've ever done a show and we're just

1100
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:51,680
sitting there and we're telling just the worst story in the world and somebody hits the,

1101
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:53,080
"Damn!"

1102
00:37:53,080 --> 00:37:55,040
We need one of those.

1103
00:37:55,040 --> 00:38:00,360
We've always needed a really stupid producer.

1104
00:38:00,360 --> 00:38:01,200
- We need to get rid of Juvia.

1105
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:02,020
- Juvia's too--

1106
00:38:02,020 --> 00:38:04,500
- Juvia's too just normal and kind of tame.

1107
00:38:04,500 --> 00:38:07,860
We need like a fucking really, really dumb guy

1108
00:38:07,860 --> 00:38:11,140
that we borrow from fucking Gas Digital

1109
00:38:11,140 --> 00:38:13,580
to come over here and press buttons,

1110
00:38:13,580 --> 00:38:14,860
press fart buttons for us.

1111
00:38:14,860 --> 00:38:17,020
- Yeah, yeah, he just sits there and hits like,

1112
00:38:17,020 --> 00:38:20,460
finish him, and it's like it makes no fucking sense

1113
00:38:20,460 --> 00:38:22,100
in the context of the story.

1114
00:38:22,100 --> 00:38:23,580
- That should be the only one we have.

1115
00:38:23,580 --> 00:38:26,020
- Yeah, so I talked to my mailman

1116
00:38:26,020 --> 00:38:26,860
for the first time the other day.

1117
00:38:26,860 --> 00:38:27,680
- Finish him.

1118
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:28,660
(laughing)

1119
00:38:28,660 --> 00:38:29,500
- What?

1120
00:38:29,500 --> 00:38:42,060
finish finish finish finish kill kill mailman every word text to speak that was

1121
00:38:42,060 --> 00:38:49,060
funny I love you I think you guys are slowly inventing Stephen Hawking yeah

1122
00:38:49,060 --> 00:38:55,900
not slowly at all no that's more it's less like Stephen Hawking it's more like

1123
00:38:55,900 --> 00:38:56,740
- And he was a scientist. - Like the master

1124
00:38:56,740 --> 00:38:58,300
from the first Fallout game. - And he's a scientist.

1125
00:38:58,300 --> 00:39:00,180
- And he was a scientist, he didn't invent himself.

1126
00:39:00,180 --> 00:39:01,380
- Damn, damn.

1127
00:39:01,380 --> 00:39:02,460
Finish him.

1128
00:39:02,460 --> 00:39:03,980
- Yeah, how ironic is that,

1129
00:39:03,980 --> 00:39:06,500
that the greatest scientist who ever lived, right?

1130
00:39:06,500 --> 00:39:08,260
Greatest inventor. - Was in a wheelchair.

1131
00:39:08,260 --> 00:39:09,580
- No.

1132
00:39:09,580 --> 00:39:11,660
No, the ironic thing there is that he's a--

1133
00:39:11,660 --> 00:39:12,620
- Somebody missing the whole point,

1134
00:39:12,620 --> 00:39:13,780
somebody missing the whole, like,

1135
00:39:13,780 --> 00:39:16,060
it's like, yeah, no, it's so crazy.

1136
00:39:16,060 --> 00:39:18,900
Stephen Hawking was in a wheelchair.

1137
00:39:18,900 --> 00:39:20,940
- The craziest thing was that he himself

1138
00:39:20,940 --> 00:39:23,220
was invented by God.

1139
00:39:23,220 --> 00:39:24,140
- Yeah.

1140
00:39:24,140 --> 00:39:25,620
- That's fucking crazy.

1141
00:39:25,620 --> 00:39:26,460
That is a bit of a mind-blower.

1142
00:39:26,460 --> 00:39:28,160
- I still can't believe he's dead.

1143
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:31,280
No, that's really getting me.

1144
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:33,260
Somebody just be like, that's crazy.

1145
00:39:33,260 --> 00:39:34,100
- I don't understand.

1146
00:39:34,100 --> 00:39:34,940
- People say that.

1147
00:39:34,940 --> 00:39:35,760
- That's what people say about him.

1148
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:36,600
- People say that all the time.

1149
00:39:36,600 --> 00:39:38,320
- That's not an odd thing at all.

1150
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:39,160
People are like, I can't believe he was so smart.

1151
00:39:39,160 --> 00:39:41,120
- No, it's that he talks like a robot.

1152
00:39:41,120 --> 00:39:42,000
That's the thing.

1153
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:42,840
- No.

1154
00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:43,680
- Well, it's that his body shut down.

1155
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:46,760
- It makes sense that a scientist talks like a robot.

1156
00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:48,040
Most scientists talk like robots.

1157
00:39:48,040 --> 00:39:49,720
- I guess it's not really ironic at all

1158
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:51,200
that Stephen Hawking was like that.

1159
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:53,360
- No, he had Futurama bonitis

1160
00:39:53,360 --> 00:39:54,760
and he just sat in a wheelchair for 40 years.

1161
00:39:54,760 --> 00:39:57,160
It makes sense that a scientist would live in a machine.

1162
00:39:57,160 --> 00:39:59,160
He's like Max Headroom, where he'd...

1163
00:39:59,160 --> 00:40:02,160
Max Headroom? What about Max Headroom?

1164
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:03,460
He's a computer man.

1165
00:40:03,460 --> 00:40:05,460
Oh, really? I thought Max Headroom...

1166
00:40:05,460 --> 00:40:07,060
I'm thinking of Max tonight.

1167
00:40:07,060 --> 00:40:09,360
Stephen Hawking just out of nowhere, just like...

1168
00:40:09,360 --> 00:40:10,760
"The theory of..."

1169
00:40:10,760 --> 00:40:15,160
I don't see Max Headroom. That's not in my reference pool.

1170
00:40:15,160 --> 00:40:16,460
That shouldn't be in yours.

1171
00:40:16,460 --> 00:40:19,260
The one 40-year-old listener...

1172
00:40:19,260 --> 00:40:21,560
You somehow, through your entire life,

1173
00:40:21,560 --> 00:40:24,720
You have grabbed all of the worst media

1174
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:27,480
from every single decade and just stored it

1175
00:40:27,480 --> 00:40:29,520
in your head in a perfect vault.

1176
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:33,280
So that you have all of the really stinky bad things.

1177
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:34,120
- Not true.

1178
00:40:34,120 --> 00:40:35,760
- Yeah. - Stinky cheese man.

1179
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:36,680
- That's one. - Let's get back

1180
00:40:36,680 --> 00:40:37,760
on stinky cheese.

1181
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:39,040
- Stinky cheese man. - Let's talk about that again.

1182
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:40,360
- I don't remember why we brought it up the other week,

1183
00:40:40,360 --> 00:40:41,200
but I will say that's a funny fucking--

1184
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:42,280
- I remember exactly why.

1185
00:40:42,280 --> 00:40:43,360
- Oh yeah, I remember. - Funny, well.

1186
00:40:43,360 --> 00:40:45,520
- We're not gonna get back into it.

1187
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:46,560
We'll leave it.

1188
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:47,920
- Leave it. - Leave it, leave this.

1189
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:49,040
- Leave this right now.

1190
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:52,800
And I keep looking at that tube over there.

1191
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:53,800
Which tube?

1192
00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:55,600
The blonde ass tube.

1193
00:40:55,600 --> 00:40:56,600
Should use that for something.

1194
00:40:56,600 --> 00:40:57,600
The black tube?

1195
00:40:57,600 --> 00:40:59,600
Oh, oh, the tube.

1196
00:40:59,600 --> 00:41:00,600
Can we just get the tube?

1197
00:41:00,600 --> 00:41:01,600
Go get it.

1198
00:41:01,600 --> 00:41:02,600
Go get the tube.

1199
00:41:02,600 --> 00:41:03,600
All right, hold on.

1200
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:04,600
I'll get the tube.

1201
00:41:04,600 --> 00:41:05,600
Go get the tube.

1202
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:06,600
He's going to drink his drink out of the tube.

1203
00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:07,600
Whoa, hold on.

1204
00:41:07,600 --> 00:41:11,100
Caleb was on some super power shit today.

1205
00:41:11,100 --> 00:41:12,600
No, no, the tube.

1206
00:41:12,600 --> 00:41:13,600
Look at this.

1207
00:41:13,600 --> 00:41:14,600
Caleb is drinking Marvel juice.

1208
00:41:14,600 --> 00:41:15,600
We have too many tubes over there.

1209
00:41:15,600 --> 00:41:16,600
The one on top of the shop vac.

1210
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:19,600
Oh, that.

1211
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:22,960
Right? Shouldn't this be used for something?

1212
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:24,960
Well, Caleb tried to use it.

1213
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:26,960
I'll have to look at this one though.

1214
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:28,960
Here, can I have one end of it?

1215
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:30,960
Okay, now you hold this up to your ear.

1216
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:32,960
Okay.

1217
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:34,960
Hey, T-Tip!

1218
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:36,960
Can you hear me?

1219
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:38,960
If my headphones were off, I think this would sound cool.

1220
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:40,960
Hey, T-Tip!

1221
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:42,960
No, it's all cut in the middle.

1222
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:44,960
Yeah, it's probably the cut that's ruining it.

1223
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:46,960
If this tube was like a full...

1224
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:48,960
Alright, this can just be on the table.

1225
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:51,080
I just really couldn't stop looking what

1226
00:41:51,080 --> 00:41:57,140
That's what I said when you guys pull out this fuck who cares about this - pulled out the tube

1227
00:41:57,140 --> 00:42:02,220
You made me I wanted to talk I didn't I wanted to talk about cool looks on the table

1228
00:42:02,220 --> 00:42:04,220
It looks like a fucking normal

1229
00:42:04,220 --> 00:42:09,380
If anybody's still listening to only audio this is gonna be the thing that pushes you over the edge. You gotta see others

1230
00:42:09,380 --> 00:42:12,800
Look at this tube

1231
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:15,240
It looks incredible. It's squiggly and silver

1232
00:42:17,080 --> 00:42:18,780
- Tattoos that people get.

1233
00:42:18,780 --> 00:42:21,020
- If you are listening to this podcast,

1234
00:42:21,020 --> 00:42:23,520
I want you to know you are fucking your entire life up.

1235
00:42:23,520 --> 00:42:24,360
- Oh yeah.

1236
00:42:24,360 --> 00:42:25,620
- Clicking on the video version.

1237
00:42:25,620 --> 00:42:26,460
- Click the video.

1238
00:42:26,460 --> 00:42:28,040
- Looking at this fucking tube.

1239
00:42:28,040 --> 00:42:30,420
This is ludicrous.

1240
00:42:30,420 --> 00:42:31,260
This is maybe the best.

1241
00:42:31,260 --> 00:42:33,660
- This is ludicrous if he was a worm.

1242
00:42:33,660 --> 00:42:35,820
- This is the most fun I've ever had.

1243
00:42:35,820 --> 00:42:36,660
Right here.

1244
00:42:36,660 --> 00:42:38,220
Wow, that is some fun shit.

1245
00:42:38,220 --> 00:42:39,260
Oh my God.

1246
00:42:39,260 --> 00:42:40,540
All right, but now the tube needs to go

1247
00:42:40,540 --> 00:42:41,380
because this is too distracting.

1248
00:42:41,380 --> 00:42:42,200
- The tube needs to stay.

1249
00:42:42,200 --> 00:42:43,040
- This is way too distracting.

1250
00:42:43,040 --> 00:42:44,820
- Just leave it on the table and relax it.

1251
00:42:44,820 --> 00:42:45,940
Just relax it.

1252
00:42:45,940 --> 00:42:46,440
Hey.

1253
00:42:46,440 --> 00:42:47,800
Chill.

1254
00:42:47,800 --> 00:42:48,840
Stop that right now.

1255
00:42:48,840 --> 00:42:50,840
If I was a worm, what would you guys do to me?

1256
00:42:50,840 --> 00:42:52,500
I would put you...

1257
00:42:52,500 --> 00:42:53,300
I would do this.

1258
00:42:53,300 --> 00:42:53,800
I would go...

1259
00:42:53,800 --> 00:42:54,300
I would go...

1260
00:42:54,300 --> 00:43:02,540
You'd put him down in front of your pants.

1261
00:43:02,540 --> 00:43:03,320
Yeah.

1262
00:43:03,320 --> 00:43:04,420
And you'd get lost.

1263
00:43:04,420 --> 00:43:04,920
I'd be a biting worm.

1264
00:43:04,920 --> 00:43:05,420
You would...

1265
00:43:05,420 --> 00:43:05,920
Worms have teeth, right?

1266
00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:06,920
You would die...

1267
00:43:06,920 --> 00:43:08,920
You would die in my fucking puke.

1268
00:43:08,920 --> 00:43:12,340
Actually, I would not die because there's so much dirt in there.

1269
00:43:12,340 --> 00:43:12,840
It'd be perfect.

1270
00:43:12,840 --> 00:43:14,840
You would travel for a worm.

1271
00:43:14,840 --> 00:43:16,320
- You would die in my pubes.

1272
00:43:16,320 --> 00:43:17,360
- Your fertile soil.

1273
00:43:17,360 --> 00:43:19,800
- You would die in my pubes like into the wild.

1274
00:43:19,800 --> 00:43:22,640
- When you're at the gym and you stand up too fast,

1275
00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:24,560
a bunch of soil falls out of your shorts.

1276
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:26,920
- His penis is razor thin, so you'd probably

1277
00:43:26,920 --> 00:43:29,400
fall through there and get, it'd be two of you.

1278
00:43:29,400 --> 00:43:31,560
- And then I'd regenerate and I'd be two, yeah.

1279
00:43:31,560 --> 00:43:32,600
- I'm gonna tell you straight up,

1280
00:43:32,600 --> 00:43:34,080
you're thinking of jellyfishes, not worms.

1281
00:43:34,080 --> 00:43:34,920
- Worms do that too.

1282
00:43:34,920 --> 00:43:37,040
- Worms do that. - Jellyfishes do not do that.

1283
00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:38,440
Worms are the things that do that,

1284
00:43:38,440 --> 00:43:40,240
and jellyfish are not. - You never grab a pile

1285
00:43:40,240 --> 00:43:41,520
of worms and just try to rip it all apart.

1286
00:43:41,520 --> 00:43:44,240
- Yeah, you've never tortured worms to make mayo more?

1287
00:43:44,240 --> 00:43:46,360
- No, I tortured bigger stuff,

1288
00:43:46,360 --> 00:43:48,480
'cause I actually had balls. - Like what, jellyfish?

1289
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:50,960
- I tortured jellyfish. - You tortured jellyfish?

1290
00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:52,280
- I would catch jellyfish.

1291
00:43:52,280 --> 00:43:53,680
- And you're not even, you're not even,

1292
00:43:53,680 --> 00:43:54,720
you're thinking of the wrong-- - And they have no

1293
00:43:54,720 --> 00:43:56,320
pain receptors, and I would torture them.

1294
00:43:56,320 --> 00:43:57,600
- You're thinking of the wrong animal.

1295
00:43:57,600 --> 00:43:59,240
Anyway, you're thinking of starfish.

1296
00:43:59,240 --> 00:44:00,080
- Yeah.

1297
00:44:00,080 --> 00:44:01,480
- You're thinking of this dust dump

1298
00:44:01,480 --> 00:44:03,360
that I just rubbed on you, that's what you're thinking about.

1299
00:44:03,360 --> 00:44:05,360
- Lizards can do that too, with their tails.

1300
00:44:05,360 --> 00:44:07,120
- They can't make a new fucking lizard.

1301
00:44:07,120 --> 00:44:08,280
- They grow a new tail.

1302
00:44:08,280 --> 00:44:09,440
- They grow a new tail,

1303
00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:11,240
and then the lizard goes on the other side.

1304
00:44:11,240 --> 00:44:12,080
- And with a, okay, with a worm--

1305
00:44:12,080 --> 00:44:15,620
- With a worm or a starfish, let's be real, those are tails.

1306
00:44:15,620 --> 00:44:20,400
They're not making a new animal, they're living tails.

1307
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:22,220
It's the same thing.

1308
00:44:22,220 --> 00:44:24,980
- You're not gonna get more scientific answer to--

1309
00:44:24,980 --> 00:44:26,880
- You're a Christian, you're not scientific.

1310
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:27,900
- He's a Christian scientist.

1311
00:44:27,900 --> 00:44:29,740
- No, I'm the Christian scientist.

1312
00:44:29,740 --> 00:44:31,880
- No, you are genetically a Christian scientist,

1313
00:44:31,880 --> 00:44:33,260
but you are not--

1314
00:44:33,260 --> 00:44:34,560
- I'm a practice, I have no,

1315
00:44:34,560 --> 00:44:37,920
listen, in a moment of weakness, I went to the doctor,

1316
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:41,360
they charged me $20,000, I'll never be back.

1317
00:44:41,360 --> 00:44:43,440
- Oh yeah, you were doing that sleep study

1318
00:44:43,440 --> 00:44:44,280
or whatever the fuck?

1319
00:44:44,280 --> 00:44:45,620
- No, that. - Or your blood work.

1320
00:44:45,620 --> 00:44:46,640
- Yeah, I had blood work.

1321
00:44:46,640 --> 00:44:47,480
- Or any other thing?

1322
00:44:47,480 --> 00:44:49,160
- Yeah, I went to the doctor.

1323
00:44:49,160 --> 00:44:51,160
- The checkup or the-- - Yeah, I had a checkup.

1324
00:44:51,160 --> 00:44:53,560
- Or chemo or dialysis. - Or chemo.

1325
00:44:53,560 --> 00:44:56,360
We don't really have to talk about my medical thing

1326
00:44:56,360 --> 00:44:58,320
except for that I'm never going back to the doctor

1327
00:44:58,320 --> 00:44:59,880
ever again. - I think we do.

1328
00:44:59,880 --> 00:45:02,200
I really wanna go get voluntary dialysis

1329
00:45:02,200 --> 00:45:04,040
'cause I do feel like it would make me feel a little better.

1330
00:45:04,040 --> 00:45:05,960
It's like when-- - What is dialysis?

1331
00:45:05,960 --> 00:45:09,120
- Dialysis is where they electrify your entire body

1332
00:45:09,120 --> 00:45:10,480
until you die. - When you call your sister.

1333
00:45:10,480 --> 00:45:11,480
- Oh, isn't...

1334
00:45:11,480 --> 00:45:13,480
Oh!

1335
00:45:13,480 --> 00:45:15,640
- Yo, that was good.

1336
00:45:15,640 --> 00:45:18,040
- That was, I had to look into the distance.

1337
00:45:18,040 --> 00:45:20,300
(laughing)

1338
00:45:20,300 --> 00:45:26,540
- I actually don't know what that is.

1339
00:45:26,540 --> 00:45:29,880
I think they put some vitamins in your kidneys.

1340
00:45:29,880 --> 00:45:32,760
- Yeah, yeah, it's what you get if you only drink

1341
00:45:32,760 --> 00:45:33,600
like, muscle energy.

1342
00:45:33,600 --> 00:45:36,360
- In my brain, dialysis is like an altered carbon

1343
00:45:36,360 --> 00:45:39,200
Blade Runner kind of thing that you just do to old people.

1344
00:45:39,200 --> 00:45:40,040
- Yeah.

1345
00:45:40,040 --> 00:45:43,720
I don't do something to them because I just there's I the only reason I think that is there's a

1346
00:45:43,720 --> 00:45:48,560
Walk by sometimes a dialysis center. I see a bunch of old people in wheelchairs. They just leave on the curb

1347
00:45:48,560 --> 00:45:53,180
Have you ever been what like walking down the street and you see an old person and you're like?

1348
00:45:53,180 --> 00:45:58,280
if I like ran if I ran fast enough I

1349
00:45:58,280 --> 00:46:06,580
Could just run I could just like drywall. Yeah, just run right the flash and turn in to turn them into red mist. Yeah

1350
00:46:08,440 --> 00:46:15,240
Because I've been to in our neighborhood in our new in our neighborhood because we're neighbors now

1351
00:46:15,240 --> 00:46:18,080
I

1352
00:46:18,080 --> 00:46:23,720
Have seen a lot of old people who look like that and I thought what if I just do it?

1353
00:46:23,720 --> 00:46:27,160
Yeah, if I just run what have you at the speed of light?

1354
00:46:27,160 --> 00:46:33,200
Ruesome public murder ever executed that's what you think

1355
00:46:35,400 --> 00:46:39,960
No, no, no, I run through an old person like it's it's not a murder if they turn into red mist

1356
00:46:39,960 --> 00:46:41,840
Then they get to be like a force girl

1357
00:46:41,840 --> 00:46:44,160
First of all if you see if you're serious about this

1358
00:46:44,160 --> 00:46:46,160
We're gonna have to start fucking training

1359
00:46:46,160 --> 00:46:52,320
NFL combine style because you there's no way you can reach a speed high enough that you can red mist a fucking old you don't know

1360
00:46:52,320 --> 00:46:58,040
You are slow bro. Stop you are the slowest of the three of us. Yeah, there's no doubt in my mind

1361
00:46:58,040 --> 00:47:01,980
That is a hundred percent true. That's my short legs

1362
00:47:02,600 --> 00:47:09,520
Because you have no you're in short roasting his L's yeah, you got your a he just you didn't have to say so

00:47:09,520 --> 00:47:16,320
You're all fucking torso. You're built like the lobster from fucking spongebob. That's true. Yeah, okay

So my whole fucking thing is all if you keep talking about pectus carinatum. Yeah, I

00:47:46,340 --> 00:47:50,540
Don't know how to pronounce it contagious

You're gonna get it. You're gonna get you could use a little bit of it. Yeah, I know what it is. It's this

1374
00:47:55,340 --> 00:47:57,340

You're a fucking sick freak. I have this weird thing. We're on my blades on the back. There's the other one

00:48:22,020 --> 00:48:25,300
I have the exact opposite. Yeah, I've never seen someone with the

You're 13 and then your mom looks at you at the pool the public pool and goes what the fuck is wrong with you?

1383
00:48:36,300 --> 00:48:38,620
You should have been wearing a binder. I had one

00:48:38,620 --> 00:48:42,380
It looked like snowboard bindings with maxi pads, and I fucking we've talked about this

I don't remember, but you are you need to get your bones shaved down if you ever want to be an actor

Do you guys ever see

Threw it back on you. I could give you more pleasure than you felt in 30 years

1390
00:49:02,240 --> 00:49:06,040
That's kind of the opposite of what I was saying. That's the no that's not the opposite of you what you're saying

1391
00:49:06,040 --> 00:49:10,200
That's the opposite of yes, man. Remember. Yes, man. Oh, yeah, no lady says

1392
00:49:10,200 --> 00:49:13,920
Let me suck your cock. He said hey guys moving a dresser

1393
00:49:13,920 --> 00:49:18,900
And then he's it says the most incredible orgasm

1394
00:49:19,660 --> 00:49:22,860
He fucking comes right in her mouth. Yeah, imagine her

1395
00:49:22,860 --> 00:49:25,020
Afterwards

1396
00:49:25,020 --> 00:49:27,180
It was me if it was me, and I was in that situation

1397
00:49:27,180 --> 00:49:31,460
I was doing yes, man, and that lady asked me that I'd fucking kill myself on the spot

1398
00:49:31,460 --> 00:49:37,260
Yeah, instead of say yes for real you wouldn't fucking old lady. What's the oldest person you would fuck ten thousand I mean

1399
00:49:37,260 --> 00:49:40,100
Okay, no mummy

1400
00:49:40,100 --> 00:49:44,580
Oldest person no mummies that you would fuck cuz obviously if you've seen the return of the mummy

1401
00:49:44,580 --> 00:49:49,300
Then you know that there's hot mummies. Yeah, mommy is stir crazy hot

1402
00:49:49,300 --> 00:49:58,780
in that? Probably 115. 115? You'd fuck this guy. Yeah. You would fuck that guy. This guy,

1403
00:49:58,780 --> 00:50:02,640
look at his, is that one tooth? Look at his bean right there in his mouth. He has one

1404
00:50:02,640 --> 00:50:09,060
bean that he eats a day. Ugh, dude. Look at that bean. I don't know. Dude, I don't want

1405
00:50:09,060 --> 00:50:15,220
to be old so bad. I'm definitely going to die when I'm 50 by choice. If you, if you,

1406
00:50:15,220 --> 00:50:16,060
- They should come up with a work plan.

1407
00:50:16,060 --> 00:50:16,900
- I'm definitely gonna, I'm gonna--

1408
00:50:16,900 --> 00:50:17,980
- 50, that's early.

1409
00:50:17,980 --> 00:50:18,820
- Yeah, no. - You're halfway there.

1410
00:50:18,820 --> 00:50:20,980
- I think that's the easiest--

1411
00:50:20,980 --> 00:50:22,140
- You're halfway done? - You're halfway to 50

1412
00:50:22,140 --> 00:50:24,820
and like most of what your life so far

1413
00:50:24,820 --> 00:50:26,140
has been being a kid.

1414
00:50:26,140 --> 00:50:27,980
- Yep, that's it.

1415
00:50:27,980 --> 00:50:30,500
Once my bones stop working, once I stop being able to jump--

1416
00:50:30,500 --> 00:50:33,620
- I would rather be dead than not be a kid.

1417
00:50:33,620 --> 00:50:36,120
I saw-- (laughing)

1418
00:50:36,120 --> 00:50:39,740
- I saw this thing-- - I literally, I--

1419
00:50:39,740 --> 00:50:41,260
- You're being like four and being like,

1420
00:50:41,260 --> 00:50:42,620
"I'm gonna kill myself when I turn 18."

1421
00:50:42,620 --> 00:50:47,300
I literally I have no desire to like have gray hair.

1422
00:50:47,300 --> 00:50:48,100
I have no desire.

1423
00:50:48,100 --> 00:50:49,260
I can't wait to have gray hair.

1424
00:50:49,260 --> 00:50:49,740
Steve Martin.

1425
00:50:49,740 --> 00:50:51,500
I wish I could have gray hair tomorrow.

1426
00:50:51,500 --> 00:50:52,860
No, like I don't want to like--

1427
00:50:52,860 --> 00:50:56,900
as soon as I start, the only thing that I can eat is soup.

1428
00:50:56,900 --> 00:50:57,820
Like I'm fucking--

1429
00:50:57,820 --> 00:51:00,100
You think a 50-year-old-- well, I guess you, yeah.

1430
00:51:00,100 --> 00:51:01,420
I'll never get there, dude.

1431
00:51:01,420 --> 00:51:02,860
You're going to have your teeth--

1432
00:51:02,860 --> 00:51:03,580
I'm so gross.

1433
00:51:03,580 --> 00:51:04,900
I'm a longevity man.

1434
00:51:04,900 --> 00:51:05,860
Yeah, I'm ready to go.

1435
00:51:05,860 --> 00:51:06,700
I'm a longevity man.

1436
00:51:06,700 --> 00:51:09,220
I don't want to see my grandkids smile.

1437
00:51:09,220 --> 00:51:10,220
Why?

1438
00:51:10,220 --> 00:51:12,020
Because they're going to be smiling and say,

1439
00:51:12,020 --> 00:51:14,620
Look how weird Granddad looks.

1440
00:51:14,620 --> 00:51:18,060
- I only like Grandpa when he gives me candy.

1441
00:51:18,060 --> 00:51:20,660
- Yeah, you have a-- - Fucking, I hate my grandkids.

1442
00:51:20,660 --> 00:51:21,780
I hate my grandkids.

1443
00:51:21,780 --> 00:51:22,620
- I'll say this right now,

1444
00:51:22,620 --> 00:51:25,620
I cannot wait to experience the love of my grandchildren.

1445
00:51:25,620 --> 00:51:29,920
(buzzer)

1446
00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:31,880
- Yeah, it was--

1447
00:51:31,880 --> 00:51:33,540
- No, no. (laughing)

1448
00:51:33,540 --> 00:51:34,780
No, not that one.

1449
00:51:34,780 --> 00:51:38,260
There we go.

1450
00:51:38,260 --> 00:51:41,380
I cannot, I think that the love between grandkids

1451
00:51:41,380 --> 00:51:42,980
and grand...

1452
00:51:42,980 --> 00:51:44,180
- Well, you have a good relationship with your parents.

1453
00:51:44,180 --> 00:51:46,380
- Oh, here's something I was thinking about the other day.

1454
00:51:46,380 --> 00:51:47,220
- It's the number one.

1455
00:51:47,220 --> 00:51:48,060
- Do you know what I realized?

1456
00:51:48,060 --> 00:51:48,960
Maybe this is a stupid realization,

1457
00:51:48,960 --> 00:51:51,460
but I realized like, oh, when you're a kid,

1458
00:51:51,460 --> 00:51:54,400
like the toys that you have and you play with,

1459
00:51:54,400 --> 00:51:56,940
your parents choose all the toys you play with.

1460
00:51:56,940 --> 00:51:57,780
Your parents completely control that.

1461
00:51:57,780 --> 00:51:58,700
- Holy fucking shit, wow.

1462
00:51:58,700 --> 00:52:00,580
- So when I have kids, I think I'm gonna get--

1463
00:52:00,580 --> 00:52:01,420
- Fucking wow.

1464
00:52:01,420 --> 00:52:04,340
- I'm gonna get my kids all of the like,

1465
00:52:04,340 --> 00:52:07,640
just a bunch of fucked up like secondary characters

1466
00:52:07,640 --> 00:52:09,620
from like tie-in toy lines from movies

1467
00:52:09,620 --> 00:52:11,900
that nobody's ever seen or will ever see again.

1468
00:52:11,900 --> 00:52:12,740
- You're gonna go on eBay.

1469
00:52:12,740 --> 00:52:16,340
- Because yeah, they'll be playing with some shitty toy

1470
00:52:16,340 --> 00:52:17,380
that like, and they love it,

1471
00:52:17,380 --> 00:52:18,340
it's their favorite toy in the world.

1472
00:52:18,340 --> 00:52:19,620
They never know what it's from.

1473
00:52:19,620 --> 00:52:21,540
And then one day they're like 25

1474
00:52:21,540 --> 00:52:23,420
and like Johnny Mnemonic comes on TV

1475
00:52:23,420 --> 00:52:25,220
and there's something like, what the fuck?

1476
00:52:25,220 --> 00:52:26,420
(laughing)

1477
00:52:26,420 --> 00:52:27,260
That's my toy.

1478
00:52:27,260 --> 00:52:29,580
- You're gonna go on eBay and look up like

1479
00:52:29,580 --> 00:52:32,420
a lot of McDonald's characters.

1480
00:52:32,420 --> 00:52:34,820
- Yeah, specifically stuff for movies and TV shows

1481
00:52:34,820 --> 00:52:36,700
and stuff so that they have a chance to see it.

1482
00:52:36,700 --> 00:52:37,540
And they realize that--

1483
00:52:37,540 --> 00:52:39,200
- Like you're gonna get like the little teacup thing

1484
00:52:39,200 --> 00:52:42,700
from Beauty and the Beast, that's gonna be their only toy.

1485
00:52:42,700 --> 00:52:45,980
- It's a bunch of made for TV movie tie-in toys.

1486
00:52:45,980 --> 00:52:49,400
- Star Trek villains that were only on one episode

1487
00:52:49,400 --> 00:52:50,560
that they made an action figure of.

1488
00:52:50,560 --> 00:52:51,440
- Yeah, exactly.

1489
00:52:51,440 --> 00:52:53,360
My kids are gonna be like, "Can I have a T-Rex?"

1490
00:52:53,360 --> 00:52:56,720
- That literally, my mom would do that.

1491
00:52:56,720 --> 00:52:57,560
My mom and my aunt would go--

1492
00:52:57,560 --> 00:52:58,380
- You can have the Indoraptor

1493
00:52:58,380 --> 00:53:00,720
from Jurassic World, Dwarven Kingdom.

1494
00:53:00,720 --> 00:53:02,720
- My mom and my aunt would go to the flea market

1495
00:53:02,720 --> 00:53:04,920
and just get the, just like, "Oh shit,

1496
00:53:04,920 --> 00:53:07,080
"that's only a dollar, shit, my kids want toys or whatever."

1497
00:53:07,080 --> 00:53:09,360
But the difference between that is I'm curating it

1498
00:53:09,360 --> 00:53:11,680
for maximum psychic destruction.

1499
00:53:11,680 --> 00:53:13,900
Real quick, my kid will have a cronk.

1500
00:53:13,900 --> 00:53:16,360
A cronk?

1501
00:53:16,360 --> 00:53:17,640
Your kid will have a crank.

1502
00:53:17,640 --> 00:53:19,680
Your kid's gonna grow up and be a graffiti artist

1503
00:53:19,680 --> 00:53:21,080
like a fucking new generation.

1504
00:53:21,080 --> 00:53:21,920
Oh yeah.

1505
00:53:21,920 --> 00:53:23,360
My kid's gonna have a crank that he can turn

1506
00:53:23,360 --> 00:53:25,040
to power all the stuff in the house.

1507
00:53:25,040 --> 00:53:25,880
That's a good idea.

1508
00:53:25,880 --> 00:53:27,440
Did you guys ever have a shaker flashlight?

1509
00:53:27,440 --> 00:53:28,280
Yeah.

1510
00:53:28,280 --> 00:53:30,120
And you practiced jerking off with it?

1511
00:53:30,120 --> 00:53:30,940
You shake it.

1512
00:53:30,940 --> 00:53:33,960
Not a shaker, I really just had a crank.

1513
00:53:33,960 --> 00:53:34,800
I had a crank and a shaker.

1514
00:53:34,800 --> 00:53:35,640
No, you should have a shaker flashlight.

1515
00:53:35,640 --> 00:53:37,440
- I didn't have the shaker.

1516
00:53:37,440 --> 00:53:38,280
- Yeah.

1517
00:53:38,280 --> 00:53:39,120
- Yeah.

1518
00:53:39,120 --> 00:53:41,600
- Wait, where's the people on this bottom rich?

1519
00:53:41,600 --> 00:53:43,520
- Where the fuck is my brother?

1520
00:53:43,520 --> 00:53:44,360
- Yeah.

1521
00:53:44,360 --> 00:53:45,200
- There he is.

1522
00:53:45,200 --> 00:53:47,440
- Wait, you did that to your brother?

1523
00:53:47,440 --> 00:53:49,760
- Yeah, shaking fucking shit off.

1524
00:53:49,760 --> 00:53:51,060
- Where the fuck is he?

1525
00:53:51,060 --> 00:53:53,680
- They're running around the house shaking them.

1526
00:53:53,680 --> 00:53:55,120
- The power's out, I'm scared.

1527
00:53:55,120 --> 00:53:59,000
- I'm so scared, I'm so scared, I'm so scared, I'm so scared.

1528
00:53:59,000 --> 00:53:59,840
There he is.

1529
00:53:59,840 --> 00:54:01,640
(laughing)

1530
00:54:01,640 --> 00:54:03,160
I think there might be a ghost in there.

1531
00:54:03,160 --> 00:54:05,440
- Right here on the, where is he?

1532
00:54:05,440 --> 00:54:08,940
Where is my brother? Where did he go?

1533
00:54:08,940 --> 00:54:10,440
He's it!

1534
00:54:10,440 --> 00:54:11,940
Or no, I'm it!

1535
00:54:11,940 --> 00:54:12,940
Got him.

1536
00:54:12,940 --> 00:54:14,440
So simple.

1537
00:54:14,440 --> 00:54:17,440
Mom, I'm playing Manhunt.

1538
00:54:17,440 --> 00:54:21,940
Just shaking that shit.

1539
00:54:21,940 --> 00:54:25,940
And then I got into the bathroom, and it was just, it just came so naturally.

1540
00:54:25,940 --> 00:54:28,440
Yeah, I got in the bathroom at a later date in my life.

1541
00:54:28,440 --> 00:54:30,440
I got in the bathroom like way too late.

1542
00:54:30,440 --> 00:54:31,940
What age did you get in the bathroom?

1543
00:54:31,940 --> 00:54:34,440
What age did you start getting into the bathroom?

1544
00:54:34,440 --> 00:54:42,820
I was really into the bathroom recently. I'm like it's kind of weird like a lot of people get into the bathroom when they're young

1545
00:54:42,820 --> 00:54:48,860
I'm like just starting I honestly I still haven't yeah, you haven't gotten in there. Just seen what that's all about

1546
00:54:48,860 --> 00:54:54,280
In the bathroom, I don't know honestly like I was in there a little bit like in elementary school

1547
00:54:54,280 --> 00:54:59,900
But it just like wasn't for me really it's one of those things that when you get older you realize like yeah

1548
00:54:59,900 --> 00:55:01,900
The bathroom actually fucking slaps

1549
00:55:03,560 --> 00:55:07,960
Yeah, you go through if you love the bathroom middle school and high school you're like that's gay like I can't like that

1550
00:55:07,960 --> 00:55:13,120
I didn't realize like in college like who gives a fuck what anybody likes. Yeah, like who cares it doesn't matter

1551
00:55:13,120 --> 00:55:17,320
It doesn't care matter if I like that there does the bathroom ever care the people fucking make fun of it

1552
00:55:17,320 --> 00:55:20,920
It has like a shitty fan base, but it's still fucking like no

1553
00:55:20,920 --> 00:55:27,120
You literally when you get older you realize like yeah, the bathroom fan base is literally like like yeah, it's annoying

1554
00:55:27,120 --> 00:55:30,520
But yeah, it's like if you like it if you like it, then you like it

1555
00:55:30,520 --> 00:55:35,040
You know, it's like don't let the fan base of like be yourself if you like the bathroom you like the back exactly

1556
00:55:35,040 --> 00:55:41,040
If you like going to the bathroom like don't let that kind of weird social pressure

1557
00:55:41,040 --> 00:55:49,200
Posting my my my topsters top 100 appliances in the bathroom. Mm-hmm. It's like the top 100 albums thing. It's a last FM

1558
00:55:49,200 --> 00:55:51,200
Yeah, my weekly number

1559
00:55:51,200 --> 00:55:56,120
20 will surprise you the Bluetooth shower speaker. Yes

1560
00:55:56,120 --> 00:55:59,160
sharper image

1561
00:55:59,280 --> 00:56:01,120
- Death and Beyond for $5.

1562
00:56:01,120 --> 00:56:03,080
- And I wish I had an explosion queued up for this.

1563
00:56:03,080 --> 00:56:07,080
I want my shampoo and my body wash,

1564
00:56:07,080 --> 00:56:08,120
and you're gonna say I don't have any hair,

1565
00:56:08,120 --> 00:56:11,240
I want my shampoo and body wash

1566
00:56:11,240 --> 00:56:13,720
as little pumps attached to the wall in the shower.

1567
00:56:13,720 --> 00:56:14,560
- Oh, like in--

1568
00:56:14,560 --> 00:56:15,380
- Oh.

1569
00:56:15,380 --> 00:56:16,480
(air blowing)

1570
00:56:16,480 --> 00:56:17,320
- What? - That'd be nice.

1571
00:56:17,320 --> 00:56:18,140
- That's how it comes out?

1572
00:56:18,140 --> 00:56:19,240
- No, that's my explosion

1573
00:56:19,240 --> 00:56:20,920
'cause I didn't wanna open my phone.

1574
00:56:20,920 --> 00:56:23,320
But like, that's like in a hotel.

1575
00:56:23,320 --> 00:56:25,120
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. - I love that so much.

1576
00:56:25,120 --> 00:56:26,520
- No, it's cool.

1577
00:56:26,520 --> 00:56:28,560
Everything should be built into--

1578
00:56:28,560 --> 00:56:29,400
- That's right.

1579
00:56:29,400 --> 00:56:30,220
- That's good.

1580
00:56:30,220 --> 00:56:32,080
Everything should be built into the room.

1581
00:56:32,080 --> 00:56:32,920
- Yeah.

1582
00:56:32,920 --> 00:56:33,740
- There shouldn't be anything

1583
00:56:33,740 --> 00:56:35,240
that you can take out of your house.

1584
00:56:35,240 --> 00:56:36,080
- My--

1585
00:56:36,080 --> 00:56:38,760
- Yes, if I eat, if I should take a bite of a hamburger

1586
00:56:38,760 --> 00:56:40,760
and then let go and a string should pull it back

1587
00:56:40,760 --> 00:56:42,280
into a hole, right?

1588
00:56:42,280 --> 00:56:43,120
- Yeah, you have to pull it across the room.

1589
00:56:43,120 --> 00:56:45,600
- Yeah, I can pull it out and then it just goes right back.

1590
00:56:45,600 --> 00:56:46,440
- Yeah.

1591
00:56:46,440 --> 00:56:47,680
- Yeah, they should do that with plates.

1592
00:56:47,680 --> 00:56:48,520
- Walk and get it.

1593
00:56:48,520 --> 00:56:49,400
- They should do that.

1594
00:56:49,400 --> 00:56:50,240
- I have plates like that.

1595
00:56:50,240 --> 00:56:51,060
- All the plates.

1596
00:56:51,060 --> 00:56:51,900
- All the plates.

1597
00:56:51,900 --> 00:56:52,740
- All the plates that you can--

1598
00:56:52,740 --> 00:56:53,560
- You wanna eat in front of the TV.

1599
00:56:53,560 --> 00:56:55,360
- Everything should be connected to a string

1600
00:56:55,360 --> 00:56:57,040
- Yeah, as soon as you're done, okay.

1601
00:56:57,040 --> 00:56:58,420
And it all just flies.

1602
00:56:58,420 --> 00:57:02,680
- Oh my god, and it goes through like a car wash style,

1603
00:57:02,680 --> 00:57:05,440
and it cleans it off as it goes.

1604
00:57:05,440 --> 00:57:08,320
- Yeah, and you're like, if you're trying to bring plates,

1605
00:57:08,320 --> 00:57:10,040
like if your kitchen is downstairs,

1606
00:57:10,040 --> 00:57:10,940
you're trying to bring it upstairs,

1607
00:57:10,940 --> 00:57:14,080
it's like the string is just like tightly turning

1608
00:57:14,080 --> 00:57:16,360
every single corner, and you're like dragging it.

1609
00:57:16,360 --> 00:57:17,600
- And then you go and it goes like,

1610
00:57:17,600 --> 00:57:20,720
bing, bing, bing, and it flies around your house.

1611
00:57:20,720 --> 00:57:21,800
- Yeah, well I was thinking maybe--

1612
00:57:21,800 --> 00:57:22,920
- Chops your kids down.

1613
00:57:24,240 --> 00:57:26,080
It could be like, okay, the string is long enough

1614
00:57:26,080 --> 00:57:28,940
you can eat on the couch, but you can't eat in bed.

1615
00:57:28,940 --> 00:57:31,420
Maybe the wife could calibrate it that way.

1616
00:57:31,420 --> 00:57:32,560
- Okay, I like the idea,

1617
00:57:32,560 --> 00:57:34,680
but take the wife and get rid of her.

1618
00:57:34,680 --> 00:57:36,000
- She's on a string too.

1619
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:37,520
- And the guy, yes.

1620
00:57:37,520 --> 00:57:40,800
Oh, wife on a string, like soap on a rope.

1621
00:57:40,800 --> 00:57:41,840
- Why?

1622
00:57:41,840 --> 00:57:43,500
- You put it up yo ass.

1623
00:57:43,500 --> 00:57:45,080
- No.

1624
00:57:45,080 --> 00:57:47,640
'Cause you use it in the bathroom.

1625
00:57:47,640 --> 00:57:48,800
(laughing)

1626
00:57:48,800 --> 00:57:51,320
- It's 'cause you stick that whole thing up yo butt.

1627
00:57:51,320 --> 00:57:53,240
- Soap on a rope, what a great idea.

1628
00:57:53,240 --> 00:57:54,080
- Yeah.

1629
00:57:54,080 --> 00:57:55,720
- I think I might go to the bathroom later today

1630
00:57:55,720 --> 00:57:57,720
'cause I'm feeling kind of nostalgic for it.

1631
00:57:57,720 --> 00:58:00,480
(laughing)

1632
00:58:00,480 --> 00:58:02,000
- I would love to go into the bathroom,

1633
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:06,320
hit the Siri, play Kiss Me.

1634
00:58:06,320 --> 00:58:11,160
Kiss me in the bathroom.

1635
00:58:11,160 --> 00:58:14,320
- Seeing your sink in the kitchen and being like,

1636
00:58:14,320 --> 00:58:16,680
well I don't know why but I just got crazy deja vu

1637
00:58:16,680 --> 00:58:17,520
for the bathroom.

1638
00:58:17,520 --> 00:58:19,760
(laughing)

1639
00:58:19,760 --> 00:58:22,640
This seriously has bathroom vibes.

1640
00:58:22,640 --> 00:58:24,900
(laughter)

1641
00:58:24,900 --> 00:58:27,740
- This kitchen sink has mad bathroom vibes.

1642
00:58:27,740 --> 00:58:29,900
- Damn, we were trying to go for like,

1643
00:58:29,900 --> 00:58:32,540
basically heavily a bathroom inspired kitchen.

1644
00:58:32,540 --> 00:58:33,380
- Yeah.

1645
00:58:33,380 --> 00:58:35,820
- It's like kinda chic, modernist, but then also bathroom.

1646
00:58:35,820 --> 00:58:38,580
(laughter)

1647
00:58:38,580 --> 00:58:42,060
We kinda split the difference between craftsman style

1648
00:58:42,060 --> 00:58:43,300
and bathroom.

1649
00:58:43,300 --> 00:58:46,020
- The property brother's like, getting someone a house

1650
00:58:46,020 --> 00:58:47,580
and the person's like coming and trying to like,

1651
00:58:47,580 --> 00:58:49,300
peek in and see the renovations and they're like,

1652
00:58:49,300 --> 00:58:50,820
no, go, you're gonna love it, just go,

1653
00:58:50,820 --> 00:58:51,960
You have to get out of here, okay?

1654
00:58:51,960 --> 00:58:55,220
Just go relax, go on a date with your husband, it's fine.

1655
00:58:55,220 --> 00:58:56,400
And then they're like, all right.

1656
00:58:56,400 --> 00:58:57,960
They're covering their eyes, they're like, come on in.

1657
00:58:57,960 --> 00:59:01,200
They open their eyes and every room is a bathroom.

1658
00:59:01,200 --> 00:59:02,700
- And then the bathroom is the only thing

1659
00:59:02,700 --> 00:59:03,940
that looks like a living room.

1660
00:59:03,940 --> 00:59:05,420
There's like a fridge in there.

1661
00:59:05,420 --> 00:59:06,260
- A couch toilet.

1662
00:59:06,260 --> 00:59:07,560
- And then the person turns around

1663
00:59:07,560 --> 00:59:10,280
and you see that they have the biggest fucking ass

1664
00:59:10,280 --> 00:59:12,980
of all time, a giant planet-sized ass.

1665
00:59:12,980 --> 00:59:14,580
- And their husband just made of crap.

1666
00:59:14,580 --> 00:59:16,820
- Yeah, well that's the thing, yeah.

1667
00:59:18,340 --> 00:59:21,100
Husbands on Property Brothers are a different breed.

1668
00:59:21,100 --> 00:59:22,360
Hit the sound board.

1669
00:59:22,360 --> 00:59:24,480
- What do you want?

1670
00:59:24,480 --> 00:59:25,660
- Anything.

1671
00:59:25,660 --> 00:59:26,500
- Okay.

1672
00:59:26,500 --> 00:59:29,020
- Husbands on Property Brothers are a different breed.

1673
00:59:29,020 --> 00:59:30,020
- Hold on, it'll take me just a--

1674
00:59:30,020 --> 00:59:30,860
- Brah.

1675
00:59:30,860 --> 00:59:31,680
(laughing)

1676
00:59:31,680 --> 00:59:32,520
- Wait, say it, no, I'll--

1677
00:59:32,520 --> 00:59:34,060
- Husbands, I'm just saying,

1678
00:59:34,060 --> 00:59:36,820
Husbands on Property Brothers are a different breed.

1679
00:59:36,820 --> 00:59:39,240
(harp music)

1680
00:59:39,240 --> 00:59:42,900
- Maybe not that.

1681
00:59:42,900 --> 00:59:44,920
- It's okay, that moment's passed.

1682
00:59:44,920 --> 00:59:47,020
- There we go.

1683
00:59:47,020 --> 00:59:48,820
- Was that the Property Brothers?

1684
00:59:48,820 --> 00:59:49,660
- Yeah.

1685
00:59:49,660 --> 00:59:50,480
- You're saying that?

1686
00:59:50,480 --> 00:59:51,320
- Surprise mother.

1687
00:59:51,320 --> 00:59:53,380
- Surprise motherfucker.

1688
00:59:53,380 --> 00:59:55,820
- Oh, okay.

1689
00:59:55,820 --> 00:59:57,060
- Wait, yeah, wait, okay, here we go.

1690
00:59:57,060 --> 00:59:59,020
When you walk in and there's a birthday party

1691
00:59:59,020 --> 01:00:00,100
for you in your house.

1692
01:00:00,100 --> 01:00:02,340
(laughing)

1693
01:00:02,340 --> 01:00:09,580
- Dude, I am going to, I'm gonna make somehow

1694
01:00:09,580 --> 01:00:11,700
my dog mad with this fucking app.

1695
01:00:11,700 --> 01:00:13,660
Yeah, he's gonna be like, you gotta chill.

1696
01:00:13,660 --> 01:00:15,260
- It doesn't look like it's an app.

1697
01:00:15,260 --> 01:00:18,060
It looks like it's just in your browser.

1698
01:00:18,060 --> 01:00:20,100
- Okay, do you work at fucking iPhone?

1699
01:00:20,100 --> 01:00:21,300
- Yeah.

1700
01:00:21,300 --> 01:00:22,140
- I do too.

1701
01:00:22,140 --> 01:00:24,400
- I know more about iPhones 'cause I've had mine

1702
01:00:24,400 --> 01:00:26,740
for probably longer than you've ever had a phone.

1703
01:00:26,740 --> 01:00:31,080
- That's kinda cool, man. - See that?

1704
01:00:31,080 --> 01:00:33,700
- You realize that this cost me--

1705
01:00:33,700 --> 01:00:34,820
- How much did that cost you?

1706
01:00:34,820 --> 01:00:36,560
- 180 bucks.

1707
01:00:36,560 --> 01:00:40,420
- And you're gonna spend another 180 bucks in two weeks.

1708
01:00:40,420 --> 01:00:41,400
- No, I won't.

1709
01:00:41,400 --> 01:00:42,420
- Yeah, you will.

1710
01:00:42,420 --> 01:00:43,260
- You're gonna have to wait a while.

1711
01:00:43,260 --> 01:00:44,100
- Yeah, that's true, he won't.

1712
01:00:44,100 --> 01:00:46,340
he'll get someone else's old phone.

1713
01:00:46,340 --> 01:00:47,580
- Oh, that's true, yeah.

1714
01:00:47,580 --> 01:00:49,340
- I'll steal his shit out his damn house.

1715
01:00:49,340 --> 01:00:50,180
- You don't know where it is,

1716
01:00:50,180 --> 01:00:51,420
and you don't know what it looks like.

1717
01:00:51,420 --> 01:00:52,700
- Cameron, do you wanna have,

1718
01:00:52,700 --> 01:00:53,540
I'll bring a bunch of DVDs.

1719
01:00:53,540 --> 01:00:55,900
- Cameron, do you wanna have a rag smelling party?

1720
01:00:55,900 --> 01:00:57,580
(laughing)

1721
01:00:57,580 --> 01:00:59,760
Cameron, you wanna smell this rag really quick?

1722
01:00:59,760 --> 01:01:01,220
- We should smell DVDs again.

1723
01:01:01,220 --> 01:01:02,140
- Yeah.

1724
01:01:02,140 --> 01:01:04,420
Did you, we've said the name of--

1725
01:01:04,420 --> 01:01:05,260
- Did you know?

1726
01:01:05,260 --> 01:01:06,100
Did you know?

1727
01:01:06,100 --> 01:01:07,300
- Did you know?

1728
01:01:07,300 --> 01:01:10,620
- No, the knife throwing DVD.

1729
01:01:10,620 --> 01:01:11,620
- We should also do--

1730
01:01:11,620 --> 01:01:12,460
- I lost it.

1731
01:01:12,460 --> 01:01:14,960
million turds and a billion furs.

1732
01:01:14,960 --> 01:01:17,160
Yeah, we should just do the classic episode.

1733
01:01:17,160 --> 01:01:18,960
Maybe this smells like something.

1734
01:01:18,960 --> 01:01:23,660
But we've said the title of that DVD that,

1735
01:01:23,660 --> 01:01:25,160
well, about knife throwing, right?

1736
01:01:25,160 --> 01:01:25,960
No, not even a little.

1737
01:01:25,960 --> 01:01:28,560
You said we were going to upload it to the Patreon back in the day.

1738
01:01:28,560 --> 01:01:29,360
Oh, yeah.

1739
01:01:29,360 --> 01:01:32,060
And I forgot to back it up to my computer.

1740
01:01:32,060 --> 01:01:34,860
And then when I moved to New York, I lost that fucking DVD.

1741
01:01:34,860 --> 01:01:35,360
Really?

1742
01:01:35,360 --> 01:01:35,860
Yeah.

1743
01:01:35,860 --> 01:01:36,460
That's so fucked.

1744
01:01:36,460 --> 01:01:41,160
So, if you can help us, right?

1745
01:01:41,160 --> 01:01:41,660
Yeah.

1746
01:01:41,660 --> 01:01:45,660
can help us find that DVD where the fat guy with the ponytail

1747
01:01:45,660 --> 01:01:46,740
blurs his face and says--

1748
01:01:46,740 --> 01:01:47,820
You don't remember the name?

1749
01:01:47,820 --> 01:01:48,900
I don't remember the name.

1750
01:01:48,900 --> 01:01:50,660
It's something knife throwing, and it's

1751
01:01:50,660 --> 01:01:52,380
by a knife throwing company.

1752
01:01:52,380 --> 01:01:54,140
But in the video, remember he says like--

1753
01:01:54,140 --> 01:01:55,140
Knife throwing company.

1754
01:01:55,140 --> 01:01:57,780
I can teach you how to kill a man by throwing

1755
01:01:57,780 --> 01:01:59,700
a paper clip at their neck.

1756
01:01:59,700 --> 01:02:00,260
Yeah.

1757
01:02:00,260 --> 01:02:01,340
That would be so sick.

1758
01:02:01,340 --> 01:02:02,740
That was the sickest video ever.

1759
01:02:02,740 --> 01:02:03,860
We need to find that again.

1760
01:02:03,860 --> 01:02:05,900
I think I could kill someone with these.

1761
01:02:05,900 --> 01:02:06,400
I dare you.

1762
01:02:06,400 --> 01:02:07,500
He says that he can't--

1763
01:02:07,500 --> 01:02:08,460
Rah!

1764
01:02:08,460 --> 01:02:12,940
he can't show his face because he's a green beret.

1765
01:02:12,940 --> 01:02:15,460
- Oh yeah, he's anonymous.

1766
01:02:15,460 --> 01:02:16,860
- Yeah.

1767
01:02:16,860 --> 01:02:18,620
- You have a show this month, go plug it.

1768
01:02:18,620 --> 01:02:21,500
- I do, I have four shows this month actually.

1769
01:02:21,500 --> 01:02:24,060
- Don't plug shows, just plug the good ones.

1770
01:02:24,060 --> 01:02:27,980
- Why not, there's people who live in New York that listen.

1771
01:02:27,980 --> 01:02:29,940
- Don't plug bar shows.

1772
01:02:29,940 --> 01:02:32,100
- All right, you don't get to book a gig.

1773
01:02:32,100 --> 01:02:33,980
You wasted your opportunity, bye.

1774
01:02:33,980 --> 01:02:36,580
- Shareholder meeting.

1775
01:02:36,580 --> 01:02:37,420
- Oh, shareholder meeting.

1776
01:02:37,420 --> 01:02:41,420
Okay, and then on the 16th of March, I will be in Boston...

1777
01:02:41,420 --> 01:02:43,420
Nope, I'm stopping this.

1778
01:02:43,420 --> 01:02:45,420
...with Conor O'Malley.

1779
01:02:45,420 --> 01:02:48,760
[LAUGHTER]
