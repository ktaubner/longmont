00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Last time on Wally Wankoff and the Candy Bombs and Toilets Factory,

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
we met the five winners of the Wally Wankoff Brown Sticker Competition.

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Wankoff is, of course, the world's most famous businessman,

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
and specifically, candy bomb and toilet mogul on the planet.

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,880
The Wankoff Corporation instituted a brown sticker competition wherein hidden

7
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:36,760
within five of Wankoff's yummy-yums, the company's most famous candy bar, resides a

8
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:42,680
brown sticker that gives one child, adult man, or puppet access to Wankoff's famous

9
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:48,500
factory as well as a chance to be heir to his business empire. Our winners were

10
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:56,500
Bibi the Orphan, an orphan from Illinois, Waylon Aurobois, a child lawyer arguably from hell,

11
00:00:56,500 --> 00:01:03,060
John Candy, a boisterous and moronic uncle/layabout, and Pinocchio, a wooden boy from

12
00:01:03,060 --> 00:01:09,140
Pensacola, Florida. Also Chucky Fuckett, a nice young man. Upon arriving at the factory, they were

13
00:01:09,140 --> 00:01:14,340
greeted by the strange and grim visage of Wankoff, followed by a repeated greeting of a less grim,

14
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:19,700
less strange visage of a pudgy stout Gen X loser who it seems was also Wankoff.

15
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:24,820
The supposed mogul quickly crumbled under the remote scrutiny of anyone or thing at all and

16
00:01:24,820 --> 00:01:29,220
confessed to the winners that he doesn't know how the factory runs, it never lets him

17
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:34,700
leave, and that his name was changed to Wankoff, and that he's desperate for one of his potential

18
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:39,900
heirs to help him fix the factory and everything about it.

19
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:44,620
After some vague acquiescence, the winners barreled ahead with Wankoff to his factory's

20
00:01:44,620 --> 00:01:49,500
front door within the titanic iron dome that comprises his estate in Duluth, Brooklyn.

21
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:52,260
Chucky Fuckett died along the way.

22
00:01:52,260 --> 00:01:57,100
Once they arrived at the factory, Wankoff's door had an embossed, not embalmed, figure

23
00:01:57,100 --> 00:02:01,780
on it that fought the remaining winners in order to enter the factory.

24
00:02:01,780 --> 00:02:05,720
Once they slayed the door, they walked through it.

25
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:09,280
What they saw would have to be seen to be believed.

26
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:14,400
Meaning the next hour or so will, by virtue of the medium, convince you of nothing.

27
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:18,080
And yet I continue to speak and you continue to listen.

28
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:25,360
Okay, just, and you guys like see in the atrium of this factory, it's like a, ornate, it's

29
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:30,080
vast, it's like kaleidoscopic, all these colors everywhere, there's robots buzzing about,

30
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:34,780
tinkering this and that a thing, there's conveyor belts that swerve around, like carrying one

31
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:39,020
bot to another place. Caring is also these frog men that seem to be everywhere to one place and

32
00:02:39,020 --> 00:02:43,660
another place. There are dashboards and holograms and massive screens with all these like data,

33
00:02:43,660 --> 00:02:50,380
detailed data about consumer behavior and KPIs, civilians killed, like civilians killed,

34
00:02:50,380 --> 00:02:56,380
and then parentheses toilets. One dashboard just says the pit bull problem and has like a detailed

35
00:02:56,380 --> 00:03:03,260
plan on how to feed pit bulls the most chocolate. There's screens are sifted through and organized

36
00:03:03,260 --> 00:03:07,820
that seemingly random cadence, monitors are flipped around and shown to manager bots,

37
00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:11,820
you show it to VP bots who've been abstracted data, do nothing with it.

38
00:03:11,820 --> 00:03:15,500
And there's like a water cooler, a kitchen, a gym, their cliff bars,

39
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:20,140
yoga, racial sensitivity training seminars attended by older bot models in the back.

40
00:03:20,140 --> 00:03:24,780
And above you, you see like a second, third and fourth floor where there's a similar,

41
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:29,260
just sort of like this chaotic, like sort of like massive corporate operation

42
00:03:29,260 --> 00:03:31,260
with all these robots and frogs.

43
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:33,260
And some of them are wearing suits,

44
00:03:33,260 --> 00:03:35,260
some of them are wearing lab coats, some are janitors,

45
00:03:35,260 --> 00:03:37,260
some are interns.

46
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:39,260
It's crazy. And while this is all happening,

47
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:41,260
you also see arms popping out of the walls

48
00:03:41,260 --> 00:03:43,260
of the factory, tweaking the bots

49
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:45,260
as well, changing things on the

50
00:03:45,260 --> 00:03:47,260
dashboards, moving things along,

51
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:49,260
reprimanding one of the frogs.

52
00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:51,260
You see the factory operating on its own

53
00:03:51,260 --> 00:03:53,260
accord, making everything run.

54
00:03:53,260 --> 00:03:55,260
And you see Wankoff, he's like, "Pretty cool, right?

55
00:03:55,260 --> 00:03:57,260
This is my factory.

56
00:03:57,260 --> 00:04:03,660
pretty chill huh yeah it pretty much runs itself at this point got this bad boy

57
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:08,660
running for a while unbelievable I'm seeing cliff bars I'm seeing arms

58
00:04:08,660 --> 00:04:16,180
coming out of the wall yeah frogs or robots nothing is as it seems you know

59
00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:19,620
what that's I couldn't set it better myself

60
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:25,460
yeah we get to eat the candy oh right well we're gonna get to do that the

61
00:04:25,460 --> 00:04:31,000
first room we're gonna go to is my my chocolate swamp there's candy in there

62
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:35,020
there's a lot of chocolate in there yeah is that count as some people don't

63
00:04:35,020 --> 00:04:39,100
count that as candy I think chocolate is different from candy I also think

64
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:52,500
chocolate swamp is a slang term I roll deception I'm lying unless you do think

65
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:57,220
it is. Does your character think it is? I'm lying. Yeah, you're lying. 26. Yeah, he's like,

66
00:04:57,220 --> 00:05:02,900
Oh, should I change the name of the room? I went to the racial sensitivity thing. It was for robots

67
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:07,300
though. So I didn't really know how to understand what that was. But should I change the name of

68
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:12,900
the room then? It's a term for a human butthole on a hot August day. Oh, are you serious? Oh God.

69
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:19,460
That's me right now. Yeah. Figured you would like that.

70
00:05:19,460 --> 00:05:24,660
I can't stop laughing.

71
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:33,220
That kind of makes sense because so one of the issues I've been having with the factory is that

72
00:05:33,220 --> 00:05:37,460
well it seemed like I have not been in the chocolate swamp room in a while.

73
00:05:37,460 --> 00:05:43,060
Last time I was in there all the frogs in there were getting really mad at me.

74
00:05:43,060 --> 00:05:44,500
I didn't really I didn't know what was going on.

75
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:47,780
It's hard to smell different too.

76
00:05:47,780 --> 00:05:50,820
So I think some of the toilet stuff is getting in the chocolate stuff.

77
00:05:50,820 --> 00:05:51,820
Yeah, it's a kind of a mess.

78
00:05:51,820 --> 00:05:53,980
I got these three businesses.

79
00:05:53,980 --> 00:05:59,540
Let's go there.

80
00:05:59,540 --> 00:06:00,540
We'll check it out.

81
00:06:00,540 --> 00:06:03,980
You guys can help me deal with that or just if it's fine, it's fine.

82
00:06:03,980 --> 00:06:05,860
If it's not fine, I can use your help.

83
00:06:05,860 --> 00:06:09,940
And again, if you do well, you could be my heir.

84
00:06:09,940 --> 00:06:10,940
So that's pretty cool.

85
00:06:10,940 --> 00:06:11,940
You get a lot of money.

86
00:06:11,940 --> 00:06:15,940
You got all these robots here and these frog guys.

87
00:06:15,940 --> 00:06:18,340
Does that sound good?

88
00:06:18,340 --> 00:06:24,940
I've been laughing the whole time and I just started to throw up from it.

89
00:06:24,940 --> 00:06:33,940
If I was to become your heir, would I inherit a candy bar?

90
00:06:33,940 --> 00:06:39,660
Uh yeah you get like uh well I'm pretty much as many as I have been eating all the candy

91
00:06:39,660 --> 00:06:42,460
in here so yeah you could get like a lot.

92
00:06:42,460 --> 00:06:48,780
I have five faints on the spot thinking of that many candy bars.

93
00:06:48,780 --> 00:06:52,500
You see a robot go up to you as they're fanning you.

94
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:54,500
Yeah it's slapping me in the face.

95
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:57,180
Yeah you are taking damage.

96
00:06:57,180 --> 00:06:58,180
Don't give me any damage.

97
00:06:58,180 --> 00:06:59,180
Are you sure?

98
00:06:59,180 --> 00:07:00,180
I'm at 10 HP.

99
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:03,060
Okay I'll leave you alone.

100
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:08,540
And yeah, and he says like, I mean, unless you guys if you guys want to go, we can go

101
00:07:08,540 --> 00:07:11,100
or you can you can chill in the atrium.

102
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:14,780
It's is there any candy or within arm's reach?

103
00:07:14,780 --> 00:07:16,900
Yeah, there's tons of candy around.

104
00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:22,580
There's like it's like there's Cliff bars because it's a big, silly corporation.

105
00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:28,100
But there's also tons of Wankoff yummy yums around Wankoff Twizzlies.

106
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:30,600
I grab I'm going to grab a yummy yum and say,

107
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:35,020
oh, man, I love candy and then put it in my mouth and try to eat it.

108
00:07:35,020 --> 00:07:36,860
But it just falls out like Cookie Monster.

109
00:07:36,860 --> 00:07:38,260
Yeah, right.

110
00:07:38,260 --> 00:07:40,700
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

111
00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:45,020
And you see a one of the robots or come in, start sweeping it,

112
00:07:45,020 --> 00:07:49,200
sweeping up the little crumbs of candy that comes out and put into a waste

113
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:53,300
waste, a waste bin, and it's like tummy, which like you see lights on fire

114
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:54,900
as it gets disposed of.

115
00:07:57,220 --> 00:08:09,580
the

116
00:08:09,580 --> 00:08:22,180
to

117
00:08:22,180 --> 00:08:24,780
Yeah, you guys can get on the conveyor belt,

118
00:08:24,780 --> 00:08:26,740
ride your way to the chocolate room,

119
00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:27,860
chocolate swamp room.

120
00:08:27,860 --> 00:08:28,700
You see a-

121
00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:29,800
- Careful everyone, last time one of us

122
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:32,200
got onto the conveyor belt, we died.

123
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:33,340
(laughing)

124
00:08:33,340 --> 00:08:35,380
Head exploded and we did not mourn him.

125
00:08:35,380 --> 00:08:37,980
- I don't remember that at all.

126
00:08:37,980 --> 00:08:38,820
- What?

127
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:40,300
- He must have not mattered much.

128
00:08:40,300 --> 00:08:41,140
- Yeah, no.

129
00:08:41,140 --> 00:08:42,700
- Even now he fades from my memory.

130
00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:46,920
- You hear the faint buzzing of flies.

131
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:49,160
(laughing)

132
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:53,320
You guys got the conveyor belt.

133
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:56,760
This one does not whip you fast enough that it just kills a normal person.

134
00:08:56,760 --> 00:09:00,000
You guys take it easily get there.

135
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,840
As you get to the chocolate door, you see on the robots opens the door for you.

136
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:08,400
There's no scary door man there is Wankoff's face on the door again.

137
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:15,960
And you're in the chocolate swamp and is this sea of just doo doo chocolate looking shit.

138
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:17,960
The smells are conflicting.

139
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:19,360
It is hard to tell.

140
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:21,660
It's also dotted with tons of vegetation.

141
00:09:21,660 --> 00:09:25,760
He's like big trees with like fruit on them.

142
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:30,260
You also see far far in the back of this massive room.

143
00:09:30,260 --> 00:09:33,360
That is, you know, impossibly large like everything else here

144
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:37,360
a sort of Tower of Babel that looks to be made of chocolate

145
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:42,740
and metal and all these other things but mostly chocolate

146
00:09:42,740 --> 00:09:45,060
metal and probably a little bit of poop.

147
00:09:45,060 --> 00:09:49,540
Um, and Wankoff looks at any of the okay. I don't remember the tower

148
00:09:49,540 --> 00:09:51,980
so

149
00:09:51,980 --> 00:09:53,980
That's a little weird

150
00:09:53,980 --> 00:09:59,340
Okay, that's fine so yeah, uh

151
00:09:59,340 --> 00:10:03,460
Okay, that would explain why so things have not been

152
00:10:03,460 --> 00:10:06,180
all the bars that have been out have been

153
00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:12,340
Kind of old bars that we have in storage and I've been trying to figure out what so I hasn't been producing any

154
00:10:12,340 --> 00:10:14,620
Usually the factory does it itself?

155
00:10:14,620 --> 00:10:19,920
I don't know that tower might actually be why it might be stopping the churn that I need

156
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:23,640
Maybe we

157
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:26,080
You guys want to go over there? I can get to get the boat

158
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:30,540
I got a boat we can take over there. It's pretty cool. It's a speed boat

159
00:10:30,540 --> 00:10:33,360
whoa

160
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:36,480
Okay, yeah sure

161
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:40,400
And he claps twice and you see a

162
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:46,280
a little frog man sort of come around with the boat and

163
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:49,480
wait I'm on land and the boat still hits me somehow.

164
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:49,780
Yeah.

165
00:10:49,780 --> 00:10:54,380
Yeah, you guys can see it's a speed boat.

166
00:10:54,380 --> 00:10:56,580
It's got like flame decals on it.

167
00:10:56,580 --> 00:11:02,180
It looks just like the sweetest boat ever in the flame decals somehow

168
00:11:02,180 --> 00:11:04,180
somehow burn Cameron's character.

169
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:12,160
Yeah, you see, as you get close to them, they like start to like wiggle a little bit like fire.

170
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:14,600
Like, yeah.

171
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:19,720
Well, the propellers spinning mighty fast.

172
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:26,160
Yeah, I'm going to have you try to sit up in the front, if that's OK with the frog here.

173
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:33,600
And yeah, you sit with the frog and he the frog turns you guys as I.

174
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:37,520
Oh, I don't like this thing.

175
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:40,620
Oh, sorry. This is one of the they're called Sullivan's.

176
00:11:40,620 --> 00:11:42,060
I don't know what they are.

177
00:11:42,060 --> 00:11:45,560
My uncle got them a long time ago.

178
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:47,660
Why is he's gross?

179
00:11:47,660 --> 00:11:49,320
Your uncle got them.

180
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:50,980
Yeah. Elaborate.

181
00:11:50,980 --> 00:11:53,820
Oh, well, it feels like maybe these are slaves.

182
00:11:53,820 --> 00:11:56,360
OK, well, let me actually you know what?

183
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:58,580
Hold on, because they're going to you said the magic word.

184
00:11:58,580 --> 00:11:59,520
And you see

185
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:08,160
one year so steps ahead every one year so frogs sort of come out and they're doing a little like

186
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:14,080
a little like a uh dance like going up down one's going up one's going down one's going up one's

187
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:22,800
going down and they start to sing uh um sullivan sullivan sullivan frog we are slaves we don't

188
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:32,000
like it here sullivan sullivan sullivan frog please free us we are frog slaves what do you get when

189
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:40,720
you are a slave nothing good. Wank off came to where we lived promised us subscriptions

190
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:48,480
to Harper's Bazaar now we are slaves. Doop a hee doo a oop a solo vid solo vid the frog.

191
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:53,920
Solo vid frog. And they uh just sort of uh shuffle off like yeah see they tell you that

192
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:57,760
I've tried to get them to leave here. Well the whole thing seems like a misunderstanding.

193
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:05,760
But I didn't like him before but now I like that song. Yeah. Well, do you have an mp3 of that song?

194
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:10,880
Yeah, can I get that song on cd? Well, i've been told that I i'll that that it could be a big hit

195
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:15,920
But I i've been afraid to release it. I mean, I know that the one of the frogs is very into mastering

196
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:22,580
I mean, he's into this wall of sound thing like I oh, yeah, he's been basically trying to master it for solvin specter

197
00:13:22,580 --> 00:13:24,800
Yeah, he's uh

198
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:26,800
He's a pain in the ass

199
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:29,520
Watch out for what he does to his wife.

200
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:32,720
Oh yeah, I'm sure it'll be fine.

201
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:36,880
Better make sure he doesn't have a wife.

202
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:39,440
Yeah, I mean, I don't know if the frogs marry.

203
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:43,120
And as like, almost on cue, as you like are getting closer to this tower,

204
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:47,360
you start to see that there are all these frogs who are poking their heads out of the tower.

205
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:52,080
And they're looking down and they're like looking to see you guys as you're approaching the speedboat.

206
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:58,360
And one of them is sort of swimming in the chocolate sludge river.

207
00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:01,880
And he goes, halt, do not come any further.

208
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:03,400
And this people just goes over him

209
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:08,640
and another one comes out and he has like a little raft of his own.

210
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:09,880
He's like, OK, all right.

211
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:12,200
All right. Please stop. Please stop.

212
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:16,360
The other frog sort of slows it down

213
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:20,560
and he says, hey, what are you doing here?

214
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:23,560
and the wall is like a

215
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:27,560
hi I run the factory my name is

216
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:33,960
Wally Wankoff these are four children or three children and a very loud guy

217
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:36,960
we're here to that

218
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:42,840
yeah awesome we're here to just sort of figure out you know I've not been making

219
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:47,160
any chocolate so we're kind of running out of the back supply of the chocolate

220
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:54,160
bars

221
00:14:54,160 --> 00:15:04,160
The Chocolate Bars

222
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:11,160
and

223
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:33,160
I'm

224
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:37,480
like a bridges and things going up in these frogs here living here and he says

225
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:43,480
we've been here trying to protect ourselves from the sludge monster and

226
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:47,280
you see that every all the frogs in the tower like sludge monster sludge monster

227
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:54,120
false it's not no no it's not here it's not here he says there's a massive beast

228
00:15:54,120 --> 00:16:01,400
in the swamp it's big sort of sludge guy and he he keeps trying to he keeps eating

229
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:15,120
this

230
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:22,960
Why'd you guys is there any weapons or we just thought that we told maybe we'd be oh god. We didn't really think this through

231
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:29,040
Can you guys help us fight the sludge monster like y'all were looking for a reason to build a tower

232
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:32,920
I

233
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:36,320
Thought we were just gonna I was kind of excited by it personally

234
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:41,000
but uh, and we really put our minds to it and that was exciting but uh

235
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:45,280
Yeah, it's stopping the sludge monster. I don't think it's gonna help at all the more

236
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:50,840
In fact if I spent almost more than seven and a half seconds on it. I'm like, oh no

237
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:54,040
What's the plan to just go up kind of hide up in the tower?

238
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:58,160
Remark, maybe we would throw rocks at it. But you're

239
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:03,780
That's a good one. You thought I'd all put yourself in one central location and piss it off

240
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:11,200
Get on more a lot of us were getting drowned so you know if you go to the top of the tower

241
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:13,600
Yeah, but you're down here. Yeah

242
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:20,040
Okay

243
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:22,040
Look, we don't know why it's attacking us

244
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:27,520
But probably if the chocolates are being made it has to do with that because we always trying to make the chocolate

245
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:30,640
That's all we do we work all the time on the robots

246
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:35,520
We spin the chocolate around in the chocolate swamp work in the fudge part of the factory

247
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:37,260
We make it into fudge.

248
00:17:37,260 --> 00:17:38,460
We like our job.

249
00:17:38,460 --> 00:17:42,000
You know, those frogs that sing, they're crazy.

250
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:48,300
OK, all right.

251
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:50,100
Two worlds here.

252
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:54,700
No, we're not crazy about it.

253
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:57,220
Can you guys please help us with the monster?

254
00:17:57,220 --> 00:18:00,560
And while he sort of looks to you guys.

255
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:04,960
So this is this is what I meant when I said I had.

256
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:08,640
I say, I say, I say, "Oh, do it!"

257
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:14,480
And I take a valiant step forward and I stomp my crutch down and I fall through like ten

258
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:16,960
floors of tower.

259
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:23,620
Okay, so they're all kind of like Looney Tunes if that's gonna be a problem.

260
00:18:23,620 --> 00:18:27,080
It's a chocolate tower, right?

261
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:28,320
Chocolate and nondescript sludge.

262
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:34,280
I punch like a hole through the wall and then like grab a bunch of chocolate and start eating

263
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:38,840
the wall. Roll a constitution saving throw. You grabbed an area that was entirely sludge.

264
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:46,240
Yeah. 15. Yeah, you've eaten sludge before. Is that a fucking problem for you? It ain't

265
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:54,280
my first time. Yeah. You aimed for the sludge. A little discoloration. A green part of the

266
00:18:54,280 --> 00:19:01,160
wall. This is my favorite chocolate. I love the green chocolate. It was a Halo collab that

267
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:21,160
while

268
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:40,680
to

269
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:42,680
I don't know. We'll see.

270
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:44,680
Alright. Well, you know what? I'm pretty much positive.

271
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:47,680
It seems like I'm in charge of this Pinocchio situation.

272
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:49,680
So, yeah. It does.

273
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:52,680
And now my nose is only 53 inches long.

274
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:54,680
That's not very good.

275
00:19:54,680 --> 00:20:00,680
Yeah, and as your nose shrinks, which makes a sound that's like...

276
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:04,680
You hear a...

277
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:07,680
A respondent sound of a rumbling.

278
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:13,280
and like the sound of waves shaking and you see the frogs and they're like

279
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:17,680
"THERE'S A SLUDGE MONSTER EVERYWHERE IN BATTLE STATION!"

280
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:20,680
They're like running around bumping into each other.

281
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:22,680
I'm gonna grab one of them as they run by.

282
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:23,680
"WAIT NO!"

283
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:29,680
"No yeah, you stay here, you talk to me. Now look I'm only a seven year old prosecutor, but...

284
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:34,680
So I don't know how everything works but seems like we should just talk to this sludge monster, reason with him.

285
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:36,680
He seems like a good guy to me."

286
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:47,560
the

287
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:50,860
I'm 21. He's like, okay.

288
00:20:50,860 --> 00:20:55,560
And he goes up because hey.

289
00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:57,860
So then you know, he'll stop.

290
00:20:57,860 --> 00:21:01,360
Why should we try to talk to it?

291
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:03,860
All right.

292
00:21:03,860 --> 00:21:05,960
Okay, okay, you can talk to it.

293
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:08,960
And as the rumbling grows louder and it stops in front of it,

294
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:12,160
and you see this big chocolate swamp monster,

295
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:16,360
it looks like the Candyland chocolate swamp monster.

296
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:18,760
And he sort of rolls up and he's like,

297
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:23,760
"Bleah, I wanna eat more frogs."

298
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:25,360
What?

299
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:28,240
And he looks down and sees just like this posse here.

300
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:29,080
And he sees you.

301
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:32,400
- I looked down, look, all right.

302
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:34,400
Let he who doesn't wanna eat a few frogs

303
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:35,920
cast the first stone.

304
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:36,760
I've been where you're at.

305
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:39,240
I've eaten a frog or two in my day.

306
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:42,440
These frogs, they don't seem, they built a tower.

307
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:44,200
They don't seem to wanna get eaten.

308
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:46,200
(laughing)

309
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:47,640
There's nothing else you could eat?

310
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:49,280
What they want is about what I want.

311
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:50,760
I want to eat the frogs.

312
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:56,200
Yeah, if this doesn't work out, you can eat this one right here.

313
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:57,200
His name's Sullivan.

314
00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:00,760
The one you kept by?

315
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:01,760
Yeah.

316
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:02,760
I want to eat him.

317
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:04,960
And his hand starts to go out to eat him.

318
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:07,520
Start pushing the frog.

319
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:12,360
Wait, but what other kind of crap do you like to eat?

320
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:15,800
It's gotta be a few, I mean, nobody likes just one food, right?

321
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:16,780
Hmm...

322
00:22:16,780 --> 00:22:22,960
I never really thought about it, I just always only ate the frog since I've been alive.

323
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:28,700
Well, while you got this one, chow down, but just think about what other food you like to eat.

324
00:22:28,700 --> 00:22:31,180
*Muffled*

325
00:22:31,180 --> 00:22:32,380
Hmm...

326
00:22:32,380 --> 00:22:35,560
I like...

327
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:38,200
Hmm...

328
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:39,020
I like fruit.

329
00:22:39,020 --> 00:22:40,240
Like, uh...

330
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:45,120
You guys ever have a good, um, like a good, um,

331
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:48,600
what's those things called? The, uh, honeydew.

332
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:52,600
Oh yeah. Great one with the worms in it.

333
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:59,040
I'll eat worms, but, uh, I'm not thinking of that. Uh, honeydew.

334
00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:01,800
Honeydew. Really? Honeydew. That's your favorite fruit.

335
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:02,640
The first fruit.

336
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:06,080
Honeydew.

337
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:10,360
You got kiwis and strawberries and...

338
00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:12,360
Oh, those are all too tart for me.

339
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:13,720
You like honeydew?

340
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:15,720
Yeah, it's kinda mellow, kinda mild.

341
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:18,400
For a sludge monster!

342
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:21,480
Can't handle anything too tart?

343
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:24,200
It's just a matter of...

344
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:26,160
what you want, you know?

345
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:28,160
I don't believe that you have a tongue!

346
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:30,160
Show me your tongue!

347
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:32,840
He opens his mouth, and he doesn't have a tongue.

348
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:37,160
Okay! Alright, so this isn't even about the frog's taste.

349
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:41,760
There's some other kind of feet. It's got to be a textural thing. I roll inside

350
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:45,760
for I don't have a brain

351
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:49,880
Entirely would

352
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:55,280
So I'm not very insightful, but if anyone else maybe though, maybe there's a lawyer in our

353
00:23:55,280 --> 00:23:59,320
Pull something out of this sludge monster

354
00:23:59,320 --> 00:24:04,880
Hmm, and I put my my finger to my chin and I yeah the DM and ask if I can roll an insight

355
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:07,040
Yeah, I think that's fine. I think we have one more

356
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:10,300
After that, I'll get kind of okay 13 is pretty good

357
00:24:10,300 --> 00:24:15,880
Um, so yeah with 13 you can tell that like he's definitely not eating the frogs for taste

358
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:21,920
You don't know if he's like eating them out of habit or something, but he's a sex freak

359
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:25,280
He's not you don't know if he's a sex freak either

360
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:28,400
But yeah, you can you're not sure

361
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:32,660
All right. Now look look see me. Obviously you don't have a tongue

362
00:24:33,320 --> 00:24:40,080
There's no you're not eating the frogs for taste right? No, I'm not eating the frogs because you want to kill the frogs. Oh

363
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:42,960
yeah, I mean I

364
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:45,040
Yeah, I do hear all the frogs

365
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:50,400
Hey, who doesn't want to kill these frogs as soon as they meet him, yeah

366
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:56,040
I'll meet you halfway on that one. So I hate him. I'll help you kill him. I just like whip

367
00:24:56,040 --> 00:25:02,160
Okay

368
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:04,600
All right, fine

369
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:09,620
But I don't see what that has to do with with me stopping eating them then if you let me eat them

370
00:25:09,620 --> 00:25:15,980
Oh, there's only so many frogs and if I unless I misheard something earlier, they're also robots. So this is only so

371
00:25:15,980 --> 00:25:23,180
Yeah, there's frogs and robots. Okay. Oh, they're not the same. No, no, no, no, there's frogs and robots

372
00:25:23,180 --> 00:25:25,180
Yeah, I'm seven. So I got

373
00:25:25,180 --> 00:25:30,440
And you know what the DM did kind of a confusing job outlining the space

374
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:33,740
Well, I'm seven and I've been separated from my mommy and daddy so

375
00:25:33,740 --> 00:25:43,260
I've lost I hate it. So if you look, you know, there's only eventually you're gonna rat out frogs

376
00:25:43,260 --> 00:25:45,260
You need to develop other eating habits

377
00:25:45,260 --> 00:25:47,900
okay, all right, let me think and

378
00:25:47,900 --> 00:25:50,180
he

379
00:25:50,180 --> 00:25:52,700
he sort of like looks around and he sort of slits a

380
00:25:52,700 --> 00:25:57,140
look at some of the trees here that have these like different like candy fruits on them and

381
00:25:57,980 --> 00:26:02,860
And Wall-E's like, "Hold on, hold on, hold on, before you eat that.

382
00:26:02,860 --> 00:26:06,860
Some of these are bombs, again, defense contractor, fun.

383
00:26:06,860 --> 00:26:08,340
Some of these are candy.

384
00:26:08,340 --> 00:26:11,700
So just, you know, don't just grab like a handful.

385
00:26:11,700 --> 00:26:13,820
Let's try to like...

386
00:26:13,820 --> 00:26:14,820
I don't remember which.

387
00:26:14,820 --> 00:26:16,660
A lightbulb appears over my head.

388
00:26:16,660 --> 00:26:20,500
Sorry, Cameron, what's your character's name?

389
00:26:20,500 --> 00:26:21,500
Bibby.

390
00:26:21,500 --> 00:26:22,500
Bibby!

391
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:26,500
Which of the fruits would you choose?

392
00:26:26,500 --> 00:26:39,500
Well, probably this black fruit with the fuse and the skull on it.

393
00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:43,500
Well I was gonna eat that.

394
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:46,500
Alright there's a big X on that one, don't eat that fruit.

395
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:50,500
Which of the fruits looked disgusting?

396
00:26:50,500 --> 00:26:53,500
Someone couldn't pay you to eat those fruits.

397
00:26:53,500 --> 00:27:02,380
This disgusting, red, beautiful, shiny fruit with a green leaf that you give to teachers

398
00:27:02,380 --> 00:27:04,860
looks revolting to me.

399
00:27:04,860 --> 00:27:05,860
What?

400
00:27:05,860 --> 00:27:09,980
I wouldn't touch this with a 10 foot crutch.

401
00:27:09,980 --> 00:27:16,220
I'm going to grab that and hang it against my chest and throw it to him.

402
00:27:16,220 --> 00:27:17,780
Okay, the shiny one?

403
00:27:17,780 --> 00:27:18,780
Yeah.

404
00:27:18,780 --> 00:27:19,780
Okay, cool.

405
00:27:19,780 --> 00:27:22,780
He throws it and he's like, "Whoa."

406
00:27:22,780 --> 00:27:28,260
This is so much better than honeydew, which is frankly mid-tier in fruit world.

407
00:27:28,260 --> 00:27:30,260
Mid-tier at best, honestly.

408
00:27:30,260 --> 00:27:31,260
Yeah.

409
00:27:31,260 --> 00:27:34,260
What, what, can I have more?

410
00:27:34,260 --> 00:27:35,260
More?

411
00:27:35,260 --> 00:27:38,260
And you see Wally's like, yeah, yeah, yeah, there's tons, there's tons.

412
00:27:38,260 --> 00:27:39,900
Grab it, grab those fruits, grab those fruits.

413
00:27:39,900 --> 00:27:45,260
And you see the frogs all like, like, you know, spiral out of the tower, grab the fruits,

414
00:27:45,260 --> 00:27:46,260
are throwing it to the guy.

415
00:27:46,260 --> 00:27:49,860
And he's like, oh, wow, this is great.

416
00:27:49,860 --> 00:27:51,560
And you see as he's eating the fruits

417
00:27:51,560 --> 00:27:54,460
and he's like getting happier and happier,

418
00:27:54,460 --> 00:27:58,860
you see actually everyone roll perception.

419
00:27:58,860 --> 00:28:01,460
I want to see what you guys notice here.

420
00:28:01,460 --> 00:28:02,760
It's a few things can happen.

421
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:04,360
Oh, 19.

422
00:28:04,360 --> 00:28:06,660
Oh, OK, 19.

423
00:28:06,660 --> 00:28:07,360
Yes.

424
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:13,060
A Pinocchio and John Candy, which is not really a great sentence

425
00:28:13,060 --> 00:28:15,860
to say start with.

426
00:28:15,860 --> 00:28:19,060
Yeah, Pinocchio and John Candy.

427
00:28:19,060 --> 00:28:25,860
Yes, yeah, I know you guys notice that as he's eating it he's.

428
00:28:25,860 --> 00:28:43,740
He seems to be getting more mellow but you also see that there is some sort of tube as pumping into him that begins to like pump kind of cartoonishly more sludge into him and as more sludge is getting in you can see that there's kind of this like shift in his temperament.

429
00:28:44,020 --> 00:28:49,460
He eats the candy he gets kind of happy the sludge gets pumped in he gets kind of angry again

430
00:28:49,460 --> 00:28:51,780
He eats the candy he gets kind of happy

431
00:28:51,780 --> 00:28:55,900
So you see that starting to go on oh

432
00:28:55,900 --> 00:29:01,980
That guy should be eating that guy should be giving me candy, right

433
00:29:01,980 --> 00:29:04,700
Hey

434
00:29:04,700 --> 00:29:08,460
Monster hey, what a sludge monster? What's up with that?

435
00:29:08,460 --> 00:29:11,260
that tuba sludge

436
00:29:11,700 --> 00:29:16,460
Yeah, is that the tube that makes you want to give me candy? Please say yes, please say yes, please

437
00:29:16,460 --> 00:29:25,740
At the tube and he's like, oh I never I never noticed this and the tube then whips out of him

438
00:29:25,740 --> 00:29:28,560
Waps around the sludge monster

439
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:34,060
Squeezes it tight until he explodes everywhere. I

440
00:29:34,060 --> 00:29:39,860
Just I I turn around before the next thing happens. Just kind of like hitting my hands like

441
00:29:39,860 --> 00:29:40,860
(laughter)

442
00:29:40,860 --> 00:29:42,700
Well boys, job well done!

443
00:29:42,700 --> 00:29:44,340
I think we're done here.

444
00:29:44,340 --> 00:29:45,940
We saved the frogs.

445
00:29:45,940 --> 00:29:50,580
And this giant metal tube now that was extending all the way out from somewhere else in the

446
00:29:50,580 --> 00:29:52,780
factory hisses at you.

447
00:29:52,780 --> 00:29:53,780
And roll for initiative.

448
00:29:53,780 --> 00:29:54,780
Oh god.

449
00:29:54,780 --> 00:29:55,780
Woah.

450
00:29:55,780 --> 00:29:56,780
15.

451
00:29:56,780 --> 00:29:57,780
21.

452
00:29:57,780 --> 00:29:58,780
Oh my god.

453
00:29:58,780 --> 00:30:04,020
You guys are basically loco.

454
00:30:04,020 --> 00:30:05,420
I'm essentially loco.

455
00:30:05,420 --> 00:30:06,420
Alright.

456
00:30:06,420 --> 00:30:08,500
Alright, what do we got?

457
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:09,500
We got 15.

458
00:30:09,500 --> 00:30:11,800
Wow, this is much better initiative rolls than last time.

459
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:13,400
23.

460
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:15,500
You guys sucked last time.

461
00:30:15,500 --> 00:30:17,700
Yeah, we know we don't have to make us feel so

462
00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:19,800
fucking bad about it all the time.

463
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:20,800
I do that a lot.

464
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:22,800
Oh, wow.

465
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:24,000
Alright, and the snake.

466
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,000
Cool.

467
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:25,600
Okay.

468
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:27,900
I mean, you're up first, baby.

469
00:30:27,900 --> 00:30:29,400
Yep.

470
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:32,800
So there's this like coiling snake monster that's spewing

471
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:35,100
sludge out of its hole.

472
00:30:35,100 --> 00:30:37,700
Yeah, and I'm walking right up to it.

473
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:43,200
center. Of course you are. What are you doing? Wait, I say, wait,

474
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:46,240
hold on a second and I paint a big red target on the front of

475
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:54,400
it. Yeah, I'm marching up and I'm I'm I'm swinging my crutch

476
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:58,880
like a baseball bat. Go for it. That's a nine. Yeah, I ain't

The tech window guy.

487
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:47,360
I don't know what to say his name.

488
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:48,360
He does.

489
00:31:48,360 --> 00:31:49,360
I don't know.

490
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:50,360

It's like, yeah, I'm standing on my crutches and like doing a bicycle.

Yes, there we go.

497
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:04,080
I found the fighting game guy.

Uh, okay. We're at 21 initiative. We have, uh, Caleb, uh, Mr. Pinocchio, sir. You're

499
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:22,200
up. I'm going to use, um, so, so you said it's a metal tube. Yes, it is metal. So, so

500
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:27,960
how, how large is the, the opening of the metal tube? Uh, it's about like, I'd say like,

501
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:33,000
five feet diameter. Does it have ears and eyes? No, do you?

502
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:37,080
Uh, should I add? No, no, it doesn't. It doesn't. I have to be stronger as a DM. No.

503
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:42,760
Does it have a perfect weak, weak spot where maybe a wooden nose could

504
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:48,360
lodge in perfectly and kill it in one single hit? Look, man, well, I don't know if I'll allow that,

505
00:32:48,360 --> 00:32:53,000
but tell me what you want to do and let's play in the space. Okay, and one more question. Is there

506
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:59,340
Something between a lie and the truth that Pinocchio could tell that would make his nose just grow in width

507
00:32:59,340 --> 00:33:08,560
Yeah, I mean I don't what I don't know what

508
00:33:08,560 --> 00:33:16,420
Yeah, this will get this gets to Pinocchio's on politic politica. Maybe a joke or what a fact right? Hmm. Yeah joke. Yeah

509
00:33:16,420 --> 00:33:20,920
Tell a joke. Okay. Okay. I'll Hicks me man

510
00:33:20,920 --> 00:33:46,680
and

511
00:33:46,680 --> 00:33:49,640
If you do any stand up routine, that is in between a lie and a truth.

512
00:33:49,640 --> 00:33:50,760
You can grow it with.

513
00:33:50,760 --> 00:33:52,200
Okay, go for it.

514
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:59,560
Plus these, uh, uh, plus you ever notice there's a difference between marionettes and puppets?

515
00:33:59,560 --> 00:34:00,560
Right?

516
00:34:00,560 --> 00:34:03,560
Because marionettes, we be walking like this.

517
00:34:03,560 --> 00:34:05,560
Okay, you gotta roll.

518
00:34:05,560 --> 00:34:10,360
Puppets don't even, no, they don't even have legs.

519
00:34:10,360 --> 00:34:11,360
You know what I'm saying?

520
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:13,560
Rescue me and everyone else and roll.

521
00:34:13,560 --> 00:34:14,560
What should I roll?

522
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:15,560
Roll a d20.

523
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:22,400
many inches it grows. 12 inches. It's a foot wide now. Your nose. It is non-sensical. It's

524
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:28,720
so big. This is a pillar I have on my nose. Yeah. Oh god. Okay. So you have a pillar on

525
00:34:28,720 --> 00:34:34,540
your face. What are you going to do? I feel like eventually too you can figure out different

526
00:34:34,540 --> 00:34:44,960
types of things to make it curve too. Definitely. Yeah, we've got a few more episodes. I'm gonna,

527
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:48,320
I just have a free action left? No, you have a regular action. That was your free action.

528
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:54,520
Oh, okay. Perfect. Do that. Alright, I'm gonna use Eldritch Blast. Okay, cool. Yeah, go for

529
00:34:54,520 --> 00:35:01,320
it. 21. Yeah, roll for damage. Nice. 11. Wow, awesome. So you do 11 damage. Where does that

530
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:05,880
shoot out of? Does it shoot out of the pillar on your face? Uh, yeah, yeah. No, it's like

531
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:11,680
a um... It doesn't have to. Yeah, it does. It's kinda got like an Eye of Sauron type

532
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:14,960
like in yeah yeah building at the top of it

533
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:20,240
um yeah i'm not even recognizable as Pinocchio anymore

534
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:26,960
it's a terrible i'm mostly the nose yeah i'm becoming this kind of evil

535
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:30,720
horrific your eyes and mouth like

536
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:34,720
it looks like you took like a stretch tool on photoshop

537
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:37,840
and just everything is kind of orbiting like the uh

538
00:35:37,840 --> 00:35:47,360
like the event horizon of a black hole around around this nose and i'm becoming i don't know

539
00:35:47,360 --> 00:35:56,240
what's happening shooting a giant pink beam out directly this is what happens when you do comedy

540
00:35:56,240 --> 00:36:02,400
i'm becoming something different something different

541
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:09,280
Okay, yeah, you do some sizable damage to this snake thing.

542
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:13,520
You're also, your nose is like, yeah, you have a few more jokes you can tell and you

543
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:16,440
can be big enough to plug it up.

544
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:20,320
So we're at, it's 15, we have a couple 15s here.

545
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:23,480
I think Aurovar, yeah, Aurovar, your dex is higher, so you're up.

546
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:29,640
Sure, alright, I'm gonna cast, I'm gonna see that and I'm gonna look at it and go, "Oh!"

547
00:36:29,640 --> 00:36:32,240
And I'm gonna cast Dissonant Whispers.

548
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:33,680
Oh, yes.

549
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:34,680
At second level.

550
00:36:34,680 --> 00:36:40,640
So I think you've got to beat a wisdom saving throw of 14.

551
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:43,600
Yeah, let's see how I do.

552
00:36:43,600 --> 00:36:44,600
Alright.

553
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:49,520
Wow, this thing is not very wise.

554
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:53,320
Let's find out how wise.

555
00:36:53,320 --> 00:36:55,560
Nope, did not win.

556
00:36:55,560 --> 00:36:56,560
Alright.

557
00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:57,560
Lost.

558
00:36:57,560 --> 00:37:01,440
So I'm going to do 46 damage to you.

559
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:03,440
Yeah, it's not gonna be pretty

560
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:07,080
What did you do yeah

561
00:37:07,080 --> 00:37:11,900
19 19 damage good god, man. Okay. Yeah, what do you?

562
00:37:11,900 --> 00:37:26,840
Just be just picturing

563
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:32,020
He's just he's picturing he man and he's just getting very upset

564
00:37:32,020 --> 00:37:37,320
The snake takes 19 damage. Oh, man, that is he's not looking good

565
00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:41,040
Yeah

566
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:44,960
And okay cool. It is now your turn John candy

567
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:48,600
So what kind of metal tube is this?

568
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:53,200
It's like one of those like, you know, like when you see like a like an AC tube

569
00:37:53,240 --> 00:37:59,920
It's like the metal tube that like sometimes people use is like a robot arm and a cosplay. It's one of those. Okay

570
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:06,000
How far away am I? I mean, I'd say you're about like 30 ish feet away

571
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:10,840
Okay, I'm gonna try and run over to it and take my belt and and tie it up

572
00:38:10,840 --> 00:38:17,040
Okay, so we'll do is that's a grapple check for sure. Okay, so roll a strength check. Yeah

573
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:21,040
Okay, and he will just he will try to combat that he is pretty strong

574
00:38:21,560 --> 00:38:25,800
He better not be he's strong on

575
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:33,020
Yeah, he got yeah, he is you were trying to tie the belt around it and it just like thrashes about

576
00:38:33,020 --> 00:38:39,720
I mean also, especially if like unless your waist is five feet around

577
00:38:39,720 --> 00:38:43,440
It is

578
00:38:46,840 --> 00:38:54,560
He's able to thrash about and get it get out of the way. Yeah, okay that pisses me off so much because it didn't work. Mm-hmm

579
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:59,960
So then go to a rage as a bonus action, yeah, I'm gonna go into a rage

580
00:38:59,960 --> 00:39:05,280
Hell, yeah, dude. What do I roll for that? You don't roll shit. You're just gonna rage

581
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:11,440
That would have been good to do before because you'd have advantage on strength checks that's kind of funny

582
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:14,040
Yeah, now you're mad

583
00:39:14,040 --> 00:39:16,040

I'm like a band-aid mummy okay that would have been no that would have been I

596
00:40:45,840 --> 00:40:48,000

597
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,560
happened hold on let me just write down it's fine

598
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:57,560

As a bonus action, I will headbutt it in whatever is close to its face.

603
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:13,560
Whatever face-like thing it has. That's a 9.

604
00:41:13,560 --> 00:41:15,560
That's not gonna hit.

605
00:41:15,560 --> 00:41:17,560
Yeah, I just dunk my head in sludge.

606
00:41:17,560 --> 00:41:21,560
Hell yeah. Pinocchio, you're up.

607
00:41:21,560 --> 00:41:26,560
Okay, um, I am again gonna try to get my nose to grow.

608
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:28,560
Okay. In width.

609
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:36,560
Um, but, uh, uh, is it, do we decide that it's just Bill Hicks style standup?

610
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:38,560
No, it's any standup bit.

611
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:40,560
Any standup bit?

612
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:43,560
Yeah, comedy is a secret between lies and truth.

613
00:41:43,560 --> 00:41:45,560
Okay.

614
00:41:45,560 --> 00:41:47,960
Damn, you should put that in your book.

615
00:41:47,960 --> 00:41:49,560
That's some real shit.

616
00:41:49,560 --> 00:41:50,440
Wow, dude.

617
00:41:50,440 --> 00:41:51,400
That's some knowledge.

618
00:41:51,400 --> 00:42:00,120
Okay, well first, I think I'm panicking because my nose has gotten so big and I'm becoming

619
00:42:00,120 --> 00:42:01,000
a kind of monster.

620
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:06,040
I can kind of see the forest through the trees a little bit.

621
00:42:06,040 --> 00:42:10,200
I realize that this thing's going to die before my nose gets big enough.

622
00:42:10,200 --> 00:42:14,360
And if it gets five feet wide, I may die and lose myself completely.

623
00:42:15,080 --> 00:42:23,000
I'm actually gonna go I'm gonna start at first by being yeah I start like y'all

624
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:28,700
y'all ever notice and then I read it's so much pain just already from the that I

625
00:42:28,700 --> 00:42:38,300
just decided to shoot lightning at him yeah and it's a 24 yeah it's yeah y'all

626
00:42:39,300 --> 00:42:53,020
yeah you'll ever notice and then I do kind of a Jim Gaffigan like lightning

627
00:42:53,020 --> 00:43:06,480
a little bit more about two feet wide now describe your kill okay well I am

628
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:13,180
I don't see it actually because my nose is so heavy that I'm just looking directly down.

629
00:43:13,180 --> 00:43:20,600
But I hear it kind of sputter and squirm and eventually kind of shrink up as it coils back

630
00:43:20,600 --> 00:43:21,600
like a slinky.

631
00:43:21,600 --> 00:43:28,160
Yes, it does and it whips back all the way somewhere else far off in the factory.

632
00:43:28,160 --> 00:43:32,240
And you see the frogs and they're like, "We're saved!"

633
00:43:32,240 --> 00:43:34,160
they're all like so happy.

634
00:43:34,160 --> 00:43:36,920
They're doing little dances.

635
00:43:36,920 --> 00:43:39,080
There's they're going to sing another song

636
00:43:39,080 --> 00:43:43,240
and then before they do, while he's like, OK, get get back to work, please.

637
00:43:43,240 --> 00:43:45,160
Like we have so much more chocolate to make.

638
00:43:45,160 --> 00:43:48,800
And they start going back to churning the chocolate, putting it in the bars.

639
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:53,080
And while he's like, OK, thank you, this is exactly what is someone

640
00:43:53,080 --> 00:43:55,040
going to help the lawyer?

641
00:43:55,040 --> 00:43:57,640
The lawyer has passed out, he's seven.

642
00:43:57,640 --> 00:44:00,240
What's the lawyer?

643
00:44:00,240 --> 00:44:01,280

It's not my job to do that, Chris!

646

He's a- I thought he owned the candy factory!

647
00:44:08,080 --> 00:44:09,760
[laughter]

648
00:44:09,760 --> 00:44:11,360
Based on how he dressed!

649
00:44:11,360 --> 00:44:14,640
Yeah, I'm taking band-aids off myself and putting them on him.

650
00:44:14,640 --> 00:44:16,480
Okay, yeah, just roll medicine check.

651
00:44:16,480 --> 00:44:17,760
Okay.

652
00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:19,760
Just to stabilize him.

19.

654
00:44:20,640 --> 00:44:25,520
Yeah, he's stabilized, and then, um, uh, yeah, I mean, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh,

661
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:10,080
your hand so you guys beat this big sludge

662
00:45:10,080 --> 00:45:16,280
monster slash the tube coming out of it

663
00:45:10,080 --> 00:45:12,860
Uh, Pat, you did rage.

664
00:45:12,860 --> 00:45:14,660
I realize now.

665
00:45:14,660 --> 00:45:20,060
Uh, so I want you to roll on your wild surge table.

666
00:45:20,060 --> 00:45:26,020
Um, so you'll see in the actions area on D and D beyond, uh, if you

667
00:45:26,020 --> 00:45:30,780
scroll all the way down, uh, basically there's just something that

668
00:45:30,780 --> 00:45:32,340
will happen if you roll that D eight.

669
00:45:32,340 --> 00:45:34,540
Okay.

670
00:45:34,540 --> 00:45:37,620
So you got a two that two from the D eight.

671
00:45:37,620 --> 00:45:38,860
Let's see what that does.

672
00:45:39,240 --> 00:45:43,280
you teleport up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space you can see

673
00:45:43,280 --> 00:45:46,400
uh... until your rage ends you can use this effect again on each of your turns

674
00:45:46,400 --> 00:45:48,080
as a bonus action

675
00:45:48,080 --> 00:45:48,860
so

676
00:45:48,860 --> 00:45:52,560
you're just i guess you just teleport you just win the fight and then just teleport

677
00:45:52,560 --> 00:45:53,000
somewhere

678
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:57,720
(laughter)

679
00:45:57,720 --> 00:45:59,840
yeah anywhere you can see

680
00:45:59,840 --> 00:46:00,840
uh...

681
00:46:00,840 --> 00:46:02,840
alright can you describe the area for me

682
00:46:02,840 --> 00:46:07,240
sure you're on sort of like a mound of shit in a chocolate swamp

683
00:46:07,240 --> 00:46:24,080
so

684
00:46:24,080 --> 00:46:51,640
and

685
00:46:51,640 --> 00:46:52,440
Thank you.

686
00:46:52,440 --> 00:46:52,940
That's good.

687
00:46:52,940 --> 00:46:53,440
Alright.

688
00:46:53,440 --> 00:46:54,340
Yay.

689
00:46:54,340 --> 00:46:55,540
And...

690
00:46:55,540 --> 00:46:57,540
Yeah.

691
00:46:57,540 --> 00:46:58,440
Yeah.

692
00:46:58,440 --> 00:47:04,940
Wankoff is sort of like a little bit befuddled now, now that things are sort of settled down.

693
00:47:04,940 --> 00:47:07,940
He's, uh, he's kind of like, "Okay, uh..."

694
00:47:07,940 --> 00:47:09,540
So...

695
00:47:09,540 --> 00:47:11,440
That wasn't good.

696
00:47:11,440 --> 00:47:16,540
That was, uh, that tube that we just, you guys destroyed, which was good.

697
00:47:16,540 --> 00:47:17,440
That was good.

698
00:47:17,440 --> 00:47:18,240
Glad you did that.

699
00:47:18,240 --> 00:47:19,740
I was making a shit monster.

700
00:47:20,240 --> 00:47:32,680
the

701
00:47:32,680 --> 00:47:38,600
it's it's uh okay you could i i didn't know you could teleport but i just knew you were 47 but

702
00:47:38,600 --> 00:47:45,640
you could certainly that's what i do as a 47 year old i do a lot of teleporting it just happens how

703
00:47:45,640 --> 00:47:52,360
do you think i got here you can't so you can't you could certainly try to teleport to the toilet room

704
00:47:52,360 --> 00:47:58,680
but it's okay it's well over should i okay it's so much further away than 30 feet should i roll

705
00:47:58,680 --> 00:48:01,080
to see if I get stuck in the tube.

706
00:48:01,080 --> 00:48:02,080
[Laughter]

707
00:48:02,080 --> 00:48:06,280
>> Uh, I mean, you, you, there's not even a tube to get stuck in.

708
00:48:06,280 --> 00:48:08,400
>> Oh, right, right, 'cause we destroyed it.

709
00:48:08,400 --> 00:48:09,400
>> Yeah.

710
00:48:09,400 --> 00:48:14,040
I mean, the toilet room is like, also like, like a mile and a half away.

711
00:48:14,040 --> 00:48:15,040
>> Okay.

712
00:48:15,040 --> 00:48:17,480
>> Like, this place is huge.

713
00:48:17,480 --> 00:48:20,880
Do you wanna teleport into the swamp in the direction of the toilet room?

714
00:48:20,880 --> 00:48:22,280
It just sort of wade in the swamp?

715
00:48:22,280 --> 00:48:25,560
>> How, do I have to teleport like, immediately?

716
00:48:25,560 --> 00:48:27,960
Or is it gonna go away if I don't teleport?

717
00:48:27,960 --> 00:48:34,280
uh you're raging right now and rage lasts um for a minute so i would say you have like 20 more

718
00:48:34,280 --> 00:48:44,360
seconds you can rage again though um i think shit i think i'll just i'll just like stop i don't know

719
00:48:44,360 --> 00:48:50,840
uh what if i just roll like uh what if i roll like a d6 and then you just choose where i go

720
00:48:50,840 --> 00:48:56,680
depending on how high the number is yeah i like that okay one of the six directions yeah

721
00:48:57,240 --> 00:49:04,280
six cardinal directions north south east west and then there's a there's the home and work

722
00:49:04,280 --> 00:49:14,600
yeah that's yes sir yeah roll that d6 to do a forward slash four okay the north south east west

723
00:49:14,600 --> 00:49:19,560
i guess you go west 30 feet okay that's what we're doing otherwise you would have to go towards home

724
00:49:19,560 --> 00:49:26,440
or towards work um yeah you're just like on top of one of the frogs they're just like they're just

725
00:49:26,440 --> 00:49:35,200
like you're just sort of sitting on them but shut up this is my thing so anyway

726
00:49:35,200 --> 00:49:46,680
Waylon is like not Waylon sorry Wankoff yeah is like so uh okay I guess I guess

727
00:49:46,680 --> 00:49:51,560
we should go to the toilet room to figure out what's going on there I'll

728
00:49:51,560 --> 00:49:54,880
get the speed boat and you see one of the frogs goes up to Wankoff as he's

729
00:49:54,880 --> 00:49:57,560
saying this is like uh...

730
00:49:57,560 --> 00:49:58,220
and this

731
00:49:58,220 --> 00:49:59,720
mister waco

732
00:49:59,720 --> 00:50:00,760
yeah

733
00:50:00,760 --> 00:50:02,160
uh... well

734
00:50:02,160 --> 00:50:05,440
heard about the toilet room you should know is uh... because of the sludge

735
00:50:05,440 --> 00:50:07,040
monster and

736
00:50:07,040 --> 00:50:10,480
didn't get away with tower and uh...

737
00:50:10,480 --> 00:50:12,280
you know we we haven't been to the

738
00:50:12,280 --> 00:50:16,600
toilet room in a long time and i'm i'm pretty sure it's called

739
00:50:16,600 --> 00:50:18,040
when he because

740
00:50:18,040 --> 00:50:21,840
where the toilet room can get clocked it's that's the whole

741
00:50:21,840 --> 00:50:23,080
it's sort of uh...

742
00:50:23,080 --> 00:50:25,280
It's just sort of a massive pipe network.

743
00:50:25,280 --> 00:50:27,960
And we haven't been cleaning it.

744
00:50:27,960 --> 00:50:29,720
So--

745
00:50:29,720 --> 00:50:31,560
So I can't go there?

746
00:50:31,560 --> 00:50:32,360
No, you can.

747
00:50:32,360 --> 00:50:33,160
It's just clogged.

748
00:50:33,160 --> 00:50:34,480
I'm just letting you know.

749
00:50:34,480 --> 00:50:35,680
Don't you-- I didn't--

750
00:50:35,680 --> 00:50:37,000
I'm not really in charge here.

751
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:38,840
There's like other frogs who are more in charge.

752
00:50:38,840 --> 00:50:40,080
Well, Waylon's going to step forward.

753
00:50:40,080 --> 00:50:43,680
So it will seem to me that nobody in this whole factory

754
00:50:43,680 --> 00:50:46,640
has been in the toilet room in a powerful long time.

755
00:50:46,640 --> 00:50:48,200
You're going to be very uncomfortable.

756
00:50:48,200 --> 00:50:51,360
Many of you, I would think, need surgery at this point.

757
00:50:51,360 --> 00:50:54,320
Let's go to a toilet room and fix your business.

758
00:50:54,320 --> 00:50:58,800
I'm gonna stay here, but uh...

759
00:50:58,800 --> 00:51:01,080
No, no. One of you is coming with me.

760
00:51:01,080 --> 00:51:05,040
Do you need like a large piece of wood to unclog the toilet room?

761
00:51:05,040 --> 00:51:11,480
And then, uh, Wake Off for the first time in a while really looks at you, Pinocchio.

762
00:51:11,480 --> 00:51:14,600
And he's like, "Oh god, what the fuck?"

763
00:51:14,600 --> 00:51:19,400
And like really takes in the fact that your eyes and your mouth are sort of...

764
00:51:19,400 --> 00:51:19,900
Yeah.

765
00:51:19,900 --> 00:51:20,400
Yeah.

766
00:51:20,800 --> 00:51:25,680
like as you just as you described or a event event horizon black hole around

767
00:51:25,680 --> 00:51:32,400
you the nose that is actually I talk like this now because my mouth is just so thin

768
00:51:32,400 --> 00:51:37,840
it might as well be closed and what did you just say by the way make sure I heard that right

769
00:51:37,840 --> 00:51:44,720
right right then I talk like this now no no no before that oh or that do you need a hard piece

770
00:51:44,720 --> 00:52:06,720
to

771
00:52:06,720 --> 00:52:13,880
you're gonna have to roll, um, yeah, you're gonna have to roll to see if you can get on

772
00:52:13,880 --> 00:52:19,880
the speed boat without it running into you. Yeah. All right. What do I roll? Don't question

773
00:52:19,880 --> 00:52:28,000
this. Okay. Yeah, sure. Don't run into them. Roll d20 and add your acrobatics. Okay. So

774
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:34,740
just roll acrobatics is the answer. That's an eight. You start to climb towards the speed

775
00:52:34,740 --> 00:52:40,580
boat and it somehow turns towards you and hits you and you take.

776
00:52:40,580 --> 00:52:45,220
Oh, geez, you're dead. Yeah, you're dead.

777
00:52:45,220 --> 00:52:54,180
OK, yeah, wake up, runs over. He's like, OK, I'm going to carry you onto any vehicles

778
00:52:54,180 --> 00:52:59,540
we're going for. He starts dripping chocolate into your your your your little mouth.

779
00:52:59,540 --> 00:53:02,260
When if he when he does he pick me when he picks me up

780
00:53:02,260 --> 00:53:06,520
Is he yeah, he picks me up and though the boat hits him. Yeah

781
00:53:06,520 --> 00:53:09,220
Yeah

782
00:53:09,220 --> 00:53:14,780
He gets knocked back. He's like, okay, how do we get this kid on these vehicles seem to hate him? Is there?

783
00:53:14,780 --> 00:53:17,000
What can we do?

784
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:19,000
To get him onto the boat. Uh

785
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:22,340
Wait

786
00:53:22,340 --> 00:53:25,140
Throw him

787
00:53:25,140 --> 00:53:31,580
That's actually not a bad idea. Are you any points to you John candy? You're pretty strong, right?

788
00:53:31,580 --> 00:53:36,260
What can you throw this crippled boy onto the boat?

789
00:53:36,260 --> 00:53:40,420
What

790
00:53:40,420 --> 00:53:43,540
This sucks. You guys are making me do so much crap

791
00:53:43,540 --> 00:53:49,180
Here is um, I thought we were getting cake. I thought we were getting candy

792
00:53:49,980 --> 00:53:52,980
Although there's candy on the trees, I can get you one after.

793
00:53:52,980 --> 00:53:54,980
If you just throw it on the boat.

794
00:53:54,980 --> 00:53:55,980
Alright.

795
00:53:55,980 --> 00:53:56,980
Fuck!

796
00:53:56,980 --> 00:53:59,980
Okay, roll an athletics check.

797
00:53:59,980 --> 00:54:00,980
Eleven.

798
00:54:00,980 --> 00:54:02,980
Yeah, that's enough.

799
00:54:02,980 --> 00:54:03,980
It's enough.

800
00:54:03,980 --> 00:54:04,980
It's barely enough.

801
00:54:04,980 --> 00:54:09,980
You sort of get him where his head hits the side.

802
00:54:09,980 --> 00:54:15,980
I pick him up by one leg and toss him over my shoulder like that.

803
00:54:15,980 --> 00:54:20,380
Like that. Yeah, my leg is like a it's like elastic. Like there's no.

804
00:54:20,380 --> 00:54:31,020
Okay, yeah. So the rest of you are able to pretty easily get on the boat, even use Pinocchio's

805
00:54:31,020 --> 00:54:37,820
face as a plank if you want to. It's it's it's pretty easy to get on there.

806
00:54:37,820 --> 00:54:43,340
And yeah, Wankoff is going to take the boat. So you guys are going down through the swamp.

807
00:54:44,380 --> 00:54:49,500
You start to see the frogs are back to work now on everything. They're churning the chocolate.

808
00:54:49,500 --> 00:54:53,740
They're trying to get as much of the shit and sifting it through to make sure there's no more

809
00:54:53,740 --> 00:54:59,900
shit in the chocolate so they can start producing new chocolate again. And sort of round what looks

810
00:54:59,900 --> 00:55:07,260
like a cove almost inside of this chocolate swamp. And you start to hear the sound of a rushing

811
00:55:07,260 --> 00:55:13,260
waterfall as you're getting a bit closer and uh uh wankoff wankoff uh uh starts to talk to you guys

812
00:55:13,260 --> 00:55:21,260
um you know he says yeah i i i didn't i didn't want to not run the factory it was just uh again

813
00:55:21,260 --> 00:55:29,580
the halo 2 thing and things got kind of complicated uh i i i just uh you know it's like one of those

814
00:55:29,580 --> 00:55:36,060
things where uh well it's like yeah i started working on stuff and then things went wrong and

815
00:55:36,060 --> 00:55:40,860
It was just easy with the weapons, you know, the bombs, government comes in, they get the bombs.

816
00:55:40,860 --> 00:55:47,820
So what do you guys do? Are you guys also entrepreneurs?

817
00:55:47,820 --> 00:55:53,740
I haven't talked to anybody in like 20 years.

818
00:55:53,740 --> 00:56:00,220
Yeah. Oh, you're so boring to me, dude. Oh my god.

819
00:56:00,220 --> 00:56:02,540
Yeah. All right.

820
00:56:02,540 --> 00:56:04,460
Is that am I just going to be unconscious?

821
00:56:05,020 --> 00:56:07,520
Oh, you're no, you he dripped a little bit of chocolate in you.

822
00:56:07,520 --> 00:56:09,560
You got like, oh, that makes you feel alive.

823
00:56:09,560 --> 00:56:10,820
You got three.

824
00:56:10,820 --> 00:56:13,380
I mean, what does that mean?

825
00:56:13,380 --> 00:56:16,060
So what happened when he takes a bit of chocolate from the swap?

826
00:56:16,060 --> 00:56:17,120
He dipped it in.

827
00:56:17,120 --> 00:56:19,960
You got like two and a chocolate with shit water in it.

828
00:56:19,960 --> 00:56:22,460
You get knocked unconscious.

829
00:56:22,460 --> 00:56:24,020
Somebody gives you a little bit of chocolate.

830
00:56:24,020 --> 00:56:27,760
Yeah, we've established that it works for that sort of.

831
00:56:27,760 --> 00:56:30,020
That's why you're supposed to keep a little bit of chocolate with you.

832
00:56:30,020 --> 00:56:31,260
Every. Yeah.

833
00:56:31,260 --> 00:56:33,260
Yeah.

834
00:56:34,220 --> 00:56:37,160
So you guys like you're all kids, I guess.

835
00:56:37,160 --> 00:56:39,760
So, you know, you probably don't do anything. What?

836
00:56:39,760 --> 00:56:44,620
I don't know. Eight days old.

837
00:56:44,620 --> 00:56:46,720
OK, I know. Damn kid.

838
00:56:46,720 --> 00:56:50,920
Yeah. Wait, I was going to ask you, because this was really meant to be like

839
00:56:50,920 --> 00:56:53,720
a kid thing.

840
00:56:53,720 --> 00:56:56,660
What? How did you end up here?

841
00:56:56,660 --> 00:56:59,020
I took it.

842
00:56:59,020 --> 00:57:02,520
You took it from a child.

843
00:57:02,560 --> 00:57:03,060
What?

844
00:57:03,060 --> 00:57:05,120
Did you take the brown stuff?

845
00:57:05,120 --> 00:57:05,960
It's fine, man.

846
00:57:05,960 --> 00:57:08,360
No, I took it from the candy.

847
00:57:08,360 --> 00:57:10,600
You took the candy was holding the sticker.

848
00:57:10,600 --> 00:57:13,000
So the candy had the sticker.

849
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:13,840
OK, yeah.

850
00:57:13,840 --> 00:57:15,960
In your mind, the candy has possession of things.

851
00:57:15,960 --> 00:57:18,040
OK, just making sure that's clear.

852
00:57:18,040 --> 00:57:19,280
Yeah, and I took it.

853
00:57:19,280 --> 00:57:21,280
Yeah. Roll deception.

854
00:57:21,280 --> 00:57:25,680
15, pretty good.

855
00:57:25,680 --> 00:57:28,680
I would say all of you can roll inside as well, though, on him.

856
00:57:28,680 --> 00:57:29,600
OK.

857
00:57:29,600 --> 00:57:36,880
14 10.

858
00:57:36,880 --> 00:57:40,840
He's practiced this lie a lot.

859
00:57:40,840 --> 00:57:43,840
He's looking in the mirror and saying I took it.

860
00:57:43,840 --> 00:57:45,400
I took it from the candy.

861
00:57:45,400 --> 00:57:47,000
I took it from candy.

862
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:50,560
I got a 3.

863
00:57:50,560 --> 00:57:51,760
What's up?

864
00:57:51,760 --> 00:57:54,160
I don't know if my roll showed up but I got a 3.

865
00:57:54,160 --> 00:57:55,600
Oh yeah it did not show up.

866
00:57:55,600 --> 00:57:59,360
which i don't know d_n_d_ beyond game logs

867
00:57:59,360 --> 00:58:01,560
uh... overtrade up

868
00:58:01,560 --> 00:58:03,240
uh...

869
00:58:03,240 --> 00:58:04,240
okay yeah

870
00:58:04,240 --> 00:58:08,040
so yes i'm out here your powers of observation here fail you will and i

871
00:58:08,040 --> 00:58:09,120
will block

872
00:58:09,120 --> 00:58:13,240
uh... everyone else is actually to including waco who's like uh...

873
00:58:13,240 --> 00:58:14,400
uh... okay

874
00:58:14,400 --> 00:58:16,120
uh... right that's

875
00:58:16,120 --> 00:58:19,520
interesting idea of percent of possession but that's

876
00:58:19,520 --> 00:58:24,160
Reads to me story checks out adults are capable of buying candy

877
00:58:24,160 --> 00:58:32,080
Yeah, I bought it - yeah, you sure stuck on a candy thing. We're all deception again

878
00:58:32,080 --> 00:58:41,360
Well, I bought it - Waylon knows all the laws did he knows it's legal for him

879
00:58:47,480 --> 00:58:54,320
Okay, we'll keep those insights so I would say I mean Bibby you're the only person who's really yeah, I'm not

880
00:58:54,320 --> 00:59:00,020
I'm not paying attention anymore an act on that. I'm reaching for the outboard motor because I think it's a pinwheel

881
00:59:00,020 --> 00:59:09,300
You see you see yeah, you see wake up go no no no no no no no and like start to put your hand in the way

882
00:59:09,300 --> 00:59:10,900
Hey, yeah

883
00:59:10,900 --> 00:59:15,960
Let's take it easy there. Okay. All right, and you hear the water is rushing a bit louder

884
00:59:17,120 --> 00:59:17,880
Uh, okay.

885
00:59:17,880 --> 00:59:19,920
So this part's the waterfall.

886
00:59:19,920 --> 00:59:25,700
Um, it's going to lead us into the toilet room or, well, I

887
00:59:25,700 --> 00:59:27,240
guess what was the toilet room.

888
00:59:27,240 --> 00:59:31,860
So, uh, just everyone hold on to a different part of the boat.

889
00:59:31,860 --> 00:59:32,520
It'll be fine.

890
00:59:32,520 --> 00:59:34,240
It's uh, it's mostly for show.

891
00:59:34,240 --> 00:59:35,840
I'm holding shoulders.

892
00:59:35,840 --> 00:59:38,000
I hold onto a speck of dust in the air.

893
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:46,180
Uh, there's no force on earth that could, that could pry my, my

894
00:59:46,180 --> 00:59:49,220
knows at the current weight from the floor of this boat.

895
00:59:49,220 --> 00:59:51,340
Yeah, no, there's not.

896
00:59:51,340 --> 00:59:52,500
Um, okay.

897
00:59:52,500 --> 00:59:52,820
Yeah.

898
00:59:52,820 --> 00:59:53,940
And what are you holding onto?

899
00:59:53,940 --> 00:59:54,420
Weilon?

900
00:59:54,420 --> 00:59:56,220
I hold on to the steering wheel.

901
00:59:56,220 --> 00:59:56,740
Okay.

902
00:59:56,740 --> 00:59:57,180
Okay.

903
00:59:57,180 --> 00:59:59,740
Well, that's, that's what I'm holding on to.

904
00:59:59,740 --> 01:00:02,020
So you want to hold on to something else?

905
01:00:02,020 --> 01:00:02,900
Yeah.

906
01:00:02,900 --> 01:00:03,940
Out of my way.

907
01:00:03,940 --> 01:00:06,060
Yeah.

908
01:00:06,060 --> 01:00:09,580
The force of your personality and any that he doesn't want to lawsuit.

909
01:00:09,580 --> 01:00:10,940
You just grab the steering wheel.

910
01:00:10,940 --> 01:00:13,940
We'll it holds on to a wake off, hold on to something else.

911
01:00:14,380 --> 01:00:20,380
Um, and uh, yeah, so everybody just roll a just roll a strength check. This this is not meant to be

912
01:00:20,380 --> 01:00:22,700
This is not meant to throw you off

913
01:00:22,700 --> 01:00:25,180
You're trying to throw me off. No

914
01:00:25,180 --> 01:00:26,780
Wow

915
01:00:26,780 --> 01:00:28,780
In the natural 20. Yeah

916
01:00:28,780 --> 01:00:35,420
If anything happens, hold on i'll just wait

917
01:00:35,420 --> 01:00:43,100
God god damn it said that you got a uh 19 branson. Oh nice. Yeah

918
01:00:43,660 --> 01:00:45,900
I'm gonna have that D&D Beyond but not Roll20.

919
01:00:45,900 --> 01:00:47,500
Yeah, I'm gonna have that log up.

920
01:00:47,500 --> 01:00:48,620
Uh, so I just have it.

921
01:00:48,620 --> 01:00:51,820
Um, okay, that is...

922
01:00:51,820 --> 01:00:54,420
God, alright, this was really not meant to be anything,

923
01:00:54,420 --> 01:00:57,540
but you did get a critical fail, Pat, so...

924
01:00:57,540 --> 01:00:59,020
Uh, I do have to...

925
01:00:59,020 --> 01:01:01,060
I'm holding onto Bibby's shoulders.

926
01:01:01,060 --> 01:01:02,140
[laughter]

927
01:01:02,140 --> 01:01:04,260
Okay, that's maybe why.

928
01:01:04,260 --> 01:01:06,860
Yeah, okay, in this instance, uh...

929
01:01:06,860 --> 01:01:08,820
Uh, Bibby somehow holds in place,

930
01:01:08,820 --> 01:01:12,260
but I guess his bad voodoo tracks onto you,

931
01:01:12,260 --> 01:01:14,560
and you just fall towards the front of the boat

932
01:01:14,560 --> 01:01:16,860
is not your head on the front of the boat

933
01:01:16,860 --> 01:01:20,500
uh... uh... you're just gonna take a little bit damage from that

934
01:01:20,500 --> 01:01:24,240
uh... as you guys fall fall fall how much damage

935
01:01:24,240 --> 01:01:25,260
uh...

936
01:01:25,260 --> 01:01:26,740
uh... website rolled

937
01:01:26,740 --> 01:01:29,820
actually just rolled a d_-forty four

938
01:01:29,820 --> 01:01:31,740
uh... they can take three damage

939
01:01:31,740 --> 01:01:32,940
uh...

940
01:01:32,940 --> 01:01:35,940
as you not your head against about the boat

941
01:01:35,940 --> 01:01:39,340
when you guys land will also resolve like a short rest is this took some time

942
01:01:39,340 --> 01:01:41,540
and stuff and we'll just like that

943
01:01:41,540 --> 01:01:42,440
Um, yeah.

944
01:01:42,440 --> 01:01:46,940
And so you guys fall down this, this waterfall into what looks

945
01:01:46,940 --> 01:01:48,980
like a massive toilet bowl.

946
01:01:48,980 --> 01:01:53,960
And as you sink into that and you like shoot down that and the

947
01:01:53,960 --> 01:01:58,200
water comes rushing from behind you, forcing you out into.

948
01:01:58,200 --> 01:02:05,980
Something that is kind of just pitch black and also Brown and also smelly.

949
01:02:06,600 --> 01:02:11,600
And you see Wankoff as he sort of like recoils from the boat.

950
01:02:11,600 --> 01:02:14,840
And he's like, okay, yeah,

951
01:02:14,840 --> 01:02:17,480
this was supposed to be a lot cleaner.

952
01:02:17,480 --> 01:02:20,320
Okay, yeah, and there's no,

953
01:02:20,320 --> 01:02:23,720
and he goes over to a wall and he rubs some gunk off

954
01:02:23,720 --> 01:02:25,740
and he starts flicking a light.

955
01:02:25,740 --> 01:02:29,120
And he's like, yep, nope, this isn't good.

956
01:02:29,120 --> 01:02:30,960
So, oh boy.

957
01:02:30,960 --> 01:02:33,320
- Well, it seems to me if it's pitch black

958
01:02:33,320 --> 01:02:35,880
and also brown and stuff.

959
01:02:35,880 --> 01:02:37,080
That's a nighttime poop.

960
01:02:37,080 --> 01:02:39,340
(laughing)

961
01:02:39,340 --> 01:02:41,940
- This is everyone's poop.

962
01:02:41,940 --> 01:02:44,540
Well, it's really just the robots poop.

963
01:02:44,540 --> 01:02:47,500
The frogs, we don't let them poop.

964
01:02:47,500 --> 01:02:51,360
So, okay.

965
01:02:51,360 --> 01:02:54,160
- What do you mean you don't let them poop?

966
01:02:54,160 --> 01:02:55,520
- Well, I don't not let them poop.

967
01:02:55,520 --> 01:02:57,700
I think the robots have some sort of fucked up

968
01:02:57,700 --> 01:02:59,880
dominating relationship with the frogs.

969
01:02:59,880 --> 01:03:02,100
- So where does their poop go?

970
01:03:02,100 --> 01:03:04,660
I think they poop outside somewhere, I don't know.

971
01:03:04,660 --> 01:03:06,300
The robots take care of it.

972
01:03:06,300 --> 01:03:07,300
What's poop?

973
01:03:07,300 --> 01:03:08,300
You said they're pooping.

974
01:03:08,300 --> 01:03:09,300
What's poop?

975
01:03:09,300 --> 01:03:12,180
What?

976
01:03:12,180 --> 01:03:13,380
What's poop?

977
01:03:13,380 --> 01:03:15,900
Two characters who could barely talk.

978
01:03:15,900 --> 01:03:16,940
Is that?

979
01:03:16,940 --> 01:03:17,940
That's Caleb's problem.

980
01:03:17,940 --> 01:03:21,420
Cam's has gotten worse since I started mine.

981
01:03:21,420 --> 01:03:23,620
He's trying to one up me as always.

982
01:03:23,620 --> 01:03:26,940
No, my character did not have teeth since 20 minutes into the first episode.

983
01:03:26,940 --> 01:03:29,580
Why? My character's face is curved around a fucking...

984
01:03:29,580 --> 01:03:31,020
That was your choice.

985
01:03:31,020 --> 01:03:34,140
A fucking, uh, uh, yoga ball sized head!

986
01:03:34,140 --> 01:03:36,300
Baby's tongue falls out. Baby's tongue falls out.

987
01:03:36,300 --> 01:03:38,100
[Laughter]

988
01:03:38,100 --> 01:03:39,620
I lose all my facial features.

989
01:03:39,620 --> 01:03:42,060
[Laughter]

990
01:03:42,060 --> 01:03:44,060
My vocal cords have been paralyzed.

991
01:03:44,060 --> 01:03:46,060
[Laughter]

992
01:03:46,060 --> 01:03:47,420
I'm gonna take out a gavel.

993
01:03:47,420 --> 01:03:48,100
Okay.

994
01:03:48,100 --> 01:03:49,460
The, the, the...

995
01:03:49,460 --> 01:03:50,260
Alright, fine.

996
01:03:50,260 --> 01:03:51,380
You win.

997
01:03:51,380 --> 01:03:55,260
Hitting the front of the boat has turned me completely non-verbal.

998
01:03:55,260 --> 01:03:56,700
[Laughter]

999
01:03:56,700 --> 01:03:59,420
Okay, good. So only the lawyer boy can talk.

1000
01:03:59,420 --> 01:04:00,100
That's good.

1001
01:04:00,100 --> 01:04:03,340
-Oh, can I? -[laughs]

1002
01:04:03,340 --> 01:04:06,340
So, um...

1003
01:04:06,340 --> 01:04:09,240
So, WinkCup says, "Okay, we just have to..."

1004
01:04:09,240 --> 01:04:11,500
So, these hallways are meant to be...

1005
01:04:11,500 --> 01:04:16,240
Well, they're supposed to be lined with new models of toilets that you can look at.

1006
01:04:16,240 --> 01:04:20,000
I guess we've been only selling what's in the stock supply room,

1007
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:21,840
and nobody's been working in here.

1008
01:04:21,840 --> 01:04:25,840
So, we just gotta get through here, I guess,

1009
01:04:25,840 --> 01:04:28,440
and find a way out and find out how to fix this.

1010
01:04:28,440 --> 01:04:33,740
Maybe the control room can get us there. Let's let's uh, let's just venture forth

1011
01:04:33,740 --> 01:04:37,520
Onward I say

1012
01:04:37,520 --> 01:04:42,060
Okay, and you just say I said on word oh

1013
01:04:42,060 --> 01:04:50,520
Yeah, I mean you guys can walk through this area

1014
01:04:50,520 --> 01:04:55,180
For a little bit and I mean as best as you can Pinocchio

1015
01:04:56,120 --> 01:04:59,160
I guess you're just sort of dragging your pole.

1016
01:04:59,160 --> 01:05:01,200
Like, do you just push forward with it?

1017
01:05:01,200 --> 01:05:02,200
What do you how do you walk?

1018
01:05:02,200 --> 01:05:03,680
Can we establish that for a second?

1019
01:05:03,680 --> 01:05:05,920
I think at some point I got a wheelbarrow.

1020
01:05:05,920 --> 01:05:06,920
Yeah.

1021
01:05:06,920 --> 01:05:07,920
Oh, yeah.

1022
01:05:07,920 --> 01:05:08,920
We talked about you getting a wheelbarrow.

1023
01:05:08,920 --> 01:05:09,920
Yes.

1024
01:05:09,920 --> 01:05:10,920
So you did get a wheelbarrow.

1025
01:05:10,920 --> 01:05:12,520
Let's let's say you did because that's the only way this is going to make sense right

1026
01:05:12,520 --> 01:05:14,320
now.

1027
01:05:14,320 --> 01:05:16,680
But at some point, it's going to it's going to get bad.

1028
01:05:16,680 --> 01:05:17,680
Oh, yeah.

1029
01:05:17,680 --> 01:05:20,360
No, it's it's it's going to be interesting.

1030
01:05:20,360 --> 01:05:25,120
I'm walking in front of Pinocchio's wheelbarrow and it's just like running me over, over and

1031
01:05:25,120 --> 01:05:28,560
over just hitting the back of your you're stuck in the wheel.

1032
01:05:28,560 --> 01:05:34,560
Yeah. Flattened continuously. Yeah. Some kind of looney tune

1033
01:05:34,560 --> 01:05:39,920
nonsense. You guys walk for a bit. Everyone roll. Let's let's

1034
01:05:39,920 --> 01:05:43,440
let's roll perception first. Let's make sure that you guys

1035
01:05:43,440 --> 01:05:48,880
see what you guys recognize or notice in this place. Crit one

1036
01:05:48,880 --> 01:05:58,080
Awesome. Weyland, we got 19. Okay. And then, oh, and Pinocchio somehow the 17.

1037
01:05:58,080 --> 01:06:05,040
So yeah, two of you guys start to notice that Wacoff doesn't really know where he's going.

1038
01:06:05,040 --> 01:06:13,440
You start to pick up on that after about a few minutes of traveling with him. It's not even that

1039
01:06:13,440 --> 01:06:20,880
that much time. So he sort of turns around he's like okay I think we're almost

1040
01:06:20,880 --> 01:06:30,000
there okay maybe and he starts to... Well you were here earlier! Nah there's no way.

1041
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:35,120
Yeah Wally Winkoff you're more lost than a nun in a different church.

1042
01:06:35,120 --> 01:06:41,680
There's no... I don't... wait what are you... I'm not gonna interrogate that.

1043
01:06:41,680 --> 01:06:44,840
Right, yeah. Well, they have a home church at a way church

1044
01:06:44,840 --> 01:06:50,020
Your last is a nun is the first time at the away church

1045
01:06:50,020 --> 01:06:59,600
Okay, I don't know where I'm going oh what the oh

1046
01:06:59,600 --> 01:07:06,600
Okay, uh, maybe we can maybe we can uh, um

1047
01:07:11,420 --> 01:07:16,060
What if we just sort of like scream for help?

1048
01:07:16,060 --> 01:07:19,280
Right?

1049
01:07:19,280 --> 01:07:21,280
[Pewds screams]

1050
01:07:21,280 --> 01:07:23,280
[Pewds screams]

1051
01:07:23,280 --> 01:07:30,060
Okay, so Pat, with that scream, which was crazy loud,

1052
01:07:30,060 --> 01:07:35,980
you hear, you start to hear some sort of sloshing coming from in front of you,

1053
01:07:35,980 --> 01:07:46,620
And what comes into view is the form of a beautiful, like, Victorian-era-looking woman.

1054
01:07:46,620 --> 01:07:48,620
What's up?

1055
01:07:48,620 --> 01:07:50,620
Made of shit.

the

1090
01:10:22,760 --> 01:10:31,720
you Pinocchio she's looking at you she's like rotating fat as it's as it kind of

1091
01:10:31,720 --> 01:10:39,280
comes to the end you know like a coin it's spinning faster and faster well I've

1092
01:10:39,280 --> 01:10:47,400
I've been living in this area for quite some time I was used to attend to mr.

1093
01:10:47,400 --> 01:11:12,400
went

1094
01:11:12,400 --> 01:11:13,240
It's not real quick.

1095
01:11:13,240 --> 01:11:16,240
And I like try to do that thing where you put your fingers

1096
01:11:16,240 --> 01:11:18,160
together and then like jump through.

1097
01:11:18,160 --> 01:11:24,880
Yeah, roll roll acrobatics.

1098
01:11:24,880 --> 01:11:26,480
15.

1099
01:11:26,480 --> 01:11:27,320
All right.

1100
01:11:27,320 --> 01:11:30,280
You're not physically able to do this, but it doesn't look as

1101
01:11:30,280 --> 01:11:31,360
stupid as you would think.

1102
01:11:31,360 --> 01:11:39,560
And Wankoff says, Look, you've been here a while. Can you

1103
01:11:39,560 --> 01:11:40,920
please help us get out of here?

1104
01:11:40,920 --> 01:11:42,920
We I so I'm his nephew

1105
01:11:42,920 --> 01:11:49,500
He gave me the factory. I guess you got lost in the pot the the picture there

1106
01:11:49,500 --> 01:11:54,440
I was gonna say the sauce or the picture. I was had lost in the past. That's not a thing. Anyway

1107
01:11:54,440 --> 01:11:57,160
can you maybe lead us out of here or

1108
01:11:57,160 --> 01:12:00,800
Something. Yes. I I suppose I can there's only

1109
01:12:00,800 --> 01:12:09,160
Do it's rather clogged. You usually have those horrible little frogs here cleaning things, but they've been I suppose lazy lately

1110
01:12:09,760 --> 01:12:15,460
The only way out of here that I know of would be there's a weak area of the piping

1111
01:12:15,460 --> 01:12:20,100
Unfortunately, there are turd devils guarding it. Yeah

1112
01:12:20,100 --> 01:12:25,020
You're excused no, I didn't say excuse me

1113
01:12:25,020 --> 01:12:31,820
Turd turd devils. What are what are turd devils?

1114
01:12:31,820 --> 01:12:35,100
turd devils are

1115
01:12:35,100 --> 01:12:38,220
It's when you put like a devil inside of a turkey

1116
01:12:38,220 --> 01:12:52,220
*laughter*

1117
01:12:52,220 --> 01:12:54,220
That was pretty good man!

1118
01:12:54,220 --> 01:12:56,220
*laughter*

1119
01:12:56,220 --> 01:12:58,220
Sometimes you gotta hand it to the guy.

1120
01:12:58,220 --> 01:13:00,220
*laughter*

1121
01:13:00,220 --> 01:13:02,220
Yeah, I miss 100% of the shots you don't take.

1122
01:13:02,220 --> 01:13:03,220
Exactly.

1123
01:13:03,220 --> 01:13:05,220
It just takes 100% of them.

1124
01:13:05,220 --> 01:13:11,820
I I maybe that's what turd devils are now. Is that so funny?

1125
01:13:11,820 --> 01:13:19,980
Yeah, I love having devil meat on Thanksgiving

1126
01:13:19,980 --> 01:13:33,580
Yeah, okay, that's what it is it's a

1127
01:13:33,580 --> 01:13:41,260
There's no reason to I have war but it doesn't matter I'm not even kidding this is so much better

1128
01:13:41,260 --> 01:13:47,880
She says it's when a turkey is stuffed inside of a devil

1129
01:13:47,880 --> 01:13:59,860
It's when the devil is stuffed inside of a turkey

1130
01:14:01,260 --> 01:14:07,940
Departed well your your lawyer. You probably know something about devils, right? Oh, certainly. Mm-hmm

1131
01:14:07,940 --> 01:14:11,540
Okay, well, yeah valuable source of meat you stuck inside a toy

1132
01:14:11,540 --> 01:14:14,380
Thanksgiving

1133
01:14:14,380 --> 01:14:21,460
And yeah, she says well there I have to change some of their move sets

1134
01:14:21,460 --> 01:14:26,260
She says so

1135
01:14:26,760 --> 01:14:30,680
Well, I can need you there but you'd have to I I simply can't fight them

1136
01:14:30,680 --> 01:14:36,940
But if you can defeat them, we could perhaps make it to the weak area the pipe and break it open

1137
01:14:36,940 --> 01:14:43,820
Well, yeah, I'm gonna pull out a fork and a knife and tie a little bib yeah, yes

1138
01:14:43,820 --> 01:14:51,260
To a devil is no match for little boy like me. Yeah, I give a big toothless smile. I

1139
01:14:52,280 --> 01:14:57,640
Chop my gums together. I'm so hungry and excited. Yeah, when you do that, yeah

1140
01:14:57,640 --> 01:15:01,660
I'm just doing I'm doing the robot and trying to see the lady notices

1141
01:15:01,660 --> 01:15:07,080
Not saying anything

1142
01:15:07,080 --> 01:15:13,000
I'm doing this now like yeah, like my fingers on my eyes and I'm back at her and then doing like more robot move

1143
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:21,040
With a when yeah, would you smile and you show your your toothless smile?

1144
01:15:21,040 --> 01:15:32,720
the

1145
01:15:32,720 --> 01:15:34,920
the

1146
01:15:34,920 --> 01:15:37,360
the

1147
01:15:37,360 --> 01:15:42,060
the

1148
01:15:42,060 --> 01:15:44,300
the

1149
01:15:44,300 --> 01:15:46,400
the

1150
01:15:46,400 --> 01:15:48,540
the

1151
01:15:48,540 --> 01:15:50,540
a a

1152
01:15:50,540 --> 01:15:52,540
My son

1153
01:15:52,540 --> 01:15:57,020
Me you're not you my son

1154
01:15:57,020 --> 01:16:01,260
Okay, we're just gonna like

1155
01:16:01,260 --> 01:16:06,740
You guys walk a bit further into the pipe

1156
01:16:06,740 --> 01:16:12,020
You could see that there were like newer models of toilets that had been designed and like like, you know

1157
01:16:12,020 --> 01:16:15,040
Like the wank off toilet 3000 the wank off toilet

1158
01:16:15,700 --> 01:16:35,500
a

1159
01:16:35,500 --> 01:16:47,940
the

1160
01:16:47,940 --> 01:16:51,660
a turkey says gobble gobble? Well I think they say gobble, you know. I think they say bobble.

1161
01:16:51,660 --> 01:16:56,620
I need to think about what a devil sounds like and then filter that through a turkey.

1162
01:16:56,620 --> 01:17:05,500
Okay right yeah. Okay hold on. Okay that's a devil. It's sort of like fake Latin and

1163
01:17:05,500 --> 01:17:16,340
then. Not mad? Yeah. It just sounds like. That sounds like it could be a turdevil. Right?

1164
01:17:16,340 --> 01:17:18,660
It's the unmistakable sound of a toad devil.

1165
01:17:18,660 --> 01:17:20,660
[laughter]

1166
01:17:20,660 --> 01:17:22,660
Do they have a lot of these where you grow up?

1167
01:17:22,660 --> 01:17:24,660
Sure.

1168
01:17:24,660 --> 01:17:26,660
Mm-hmm. Wonderful.

1169
01:17:26,660 --> 01:17:28,660

01:17:34,660 --> 01:17:36,660
[mimics jumping]

1174
01:17:36,660 --> 01:17:38,660
Um, it's just sort of like

1175
01:17:38,660 --> 01:17:40,660
just sort of waddling around in this

1176
01:17:40,660 --> 01:17:42,660
sort of like where this weaker area of the pipe is.

1177
01:17:42,660 --> 01:17:44,660

01:18:55,460 --> 01:19:17,600
just

1188
01:19:17,600 --> 01:19:18,600
a minus on it.

1189
01:19:18,600 --> 01:19:19,600
Because you have negative constitution.

1190
01:19:19,600 --> 01:19:20,600
You have minus to a constitution.

1191
01:19:20,600 --> 01:19:21,600
Yeah.

1192
01:19:21,600 --> 01:19:22,600
Where's the hit dice?

1193
01:19:22,600 --> 01:19:23,600
If you click take short risk.

1194
01:19:23,600 --> 01:19:24,600
Alright, I'm just going for it.

1195
01:19:24,600 --> 01:19:25,600
Wow.

1196
01:19:25,600 --> 01:19:26,600
You're getting really good rolls too.

1197
01:19:26,600 --> 01:19:27,600
Those are like, yeah.

1198
01:19:27,600 --> 01:19:28,600
Yeah, it's a max roll and then two right below max.

1199
01:19:28,600 --> 01:19:29,600
I got nine, seven, and eight.

1200
01:19:29,600 --> 01:19:30,600
Those are good rolls too, Pat.

1201
01:19:30,600 --> 01:19:31,600
How good are they?

1202
01:19:31,600 --> 01:19:32,600
They're really good, buddy.

1203
01:19:32,600 --> 01:19:33,600
Yeah?

1204
01:19:33,600 --> 01:19:34,600
They're good.

1205
01:19:34,600 --> 01:19:35,600
Yeah, they're really good.

1206
01:19:35,600 --> 01:19:36,600
That's actually the best rolls in the game.

1207
01:19:36,600 --> 01:19:37,600
Don't tell them that.

1208
01:19:37,600 --> 01:19:38,600
Come on.

1209
01:19:38,600 --> 01:19:39,600
I'm not going to tell them that.

1210
01:19:39,600 --> 01:19:40,600
I'm not going to tell them that.

1211
01:19:40,600 --> 01:19:41,600
I'm not going to tell them that.

1212
01:19:41,600 --> 01:19:42,600
I'm not going to tell them that.

1213
01:19:42,600 --> 01:19:55,080
the

1214
01:19:55,080 --> 01:19:58,840
we can't baby him. We have to tell him that he didn't win the game.

1215
01:19:58,840 --> 01:20:03,960
What? No, I'm sorry. Well, that was how do you do private chat here?

1216
01:20:03,960 --> 01:20:13,560
Uh, okay, cool. And wait on you got 17 HP back. Beautiful, magical. Um, okay. So yeah,

1217
01:20:13,560 --> 01:20:19,560
does anybody have any sort of moves they want to try out besides, uh, you by the way? Yeah,

1218
01:20:19,560 --> 01:20:21,680
Sorry, Caleb, I wanted to make sure you knew.

1219
01:20:21,680 --> 01:20:26,680
So, you have a new attack, by the way.

1220
01:20:26,680 --> 01:20:29,440
- Oh my God.

1221
01:20:29,440 --> 01:20:31,160
- This is gonna be the first of a few things

1222
01:20:31,160 --> 01:20:32,680
that might be happening to you,

1223
01:20:32,680 --> 01:20:33,960
depending on how you play the game.

1224
01:20:33,960 --> 01:20:36,280
You have Pillar Face.

1225
01:20:36,280 --> 01:20:38,840
So it has 10 feet of reach.

1226
01:20:38,840 --> 01:20:41,320
It does 2D10 damage.

1227
01:20:41,320 --> 01:20:45,040
And basically involves you lifting up your entire body

1228
01:20:45,040 --> 01:20:48,160
and collapsing it on somebody or a line of people.

1229
01:20:48,160 --> 01:20:49,600
Due to my huge mask.

1230
01:20:49,600 --> 01:20:50,720
Yes, yes.

1231
01:20:50,720 --> 01:20:52,520
So you can do that now.

1232
01:20:52,520 --> 01:20:54,880
Okay.

1233
01:20:54,880 --> 01:20:55,640
Yeah.

1234
01:20:55,640 --> 01:20:56,680
Sounds good.

1235
01:20:56,680 --> 01:20:57,640
Yes.

1236
01:20:57,640 --> 01:21:05,680
Um, I, I'm just going to stand by and be ready to, to jump into action if need be.

1237
01:21:05,680 --> 01:21:06,360
Cool.

1238
01:21:06,360 --> 01:21:07,800
Um, that sounds good.

1239
01:21:07,800 --> 01:21:14,360
So yeah, I mean, what you can even do is, um, if you want to like, you can prepare a

1240
01:21:14,360 --> 01:21:20,480
like yeah I'll prepare my an attack in case if things go south that's that's

1241
01:21:20,480 --> 01:21:24,840
the that's what yeah you could do your slaying basically prepare a sling attack

1242
01:21:24,840 --> 01:21:28,960
so that you're not like near them so they don't like see you yeah all right I

1243
01:21:28,960 --> 01:21:33,120
will prepare a sling attack yeah I think things go south is good enough like I

1244
01:21:33,120 --> 01:21:38,920
mean I know people get more specific with that they can shove it um cool

1245
01:21:38,920 --> 01:21:42,920
Waylon Arovois, what are you gonna do?

1246
01:21:42,920 --> 01:21:49,440
I'm a lady turdevil and I'm walking over to them to like a brassy

1247
01:21:49,440 --> 01:21:54,600
rendition of like you must be a beautiful baby and I'm like really like getting my eggs into it

1248
01:21:54,600 --> 01:21:58,520
and I'm gonna like sort of push my hair.

1249
01:21:58,520 --> 01:22:00,520
[weird noises]

1250
01:22:00,520 --> 01:22:03,720
Yeah, they are loving it.

1251
01:22:03,720 --> 01:22:06,000
uh... they are uh...

1252
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:08,280
gobble gobble gobbling it up

1253
01:22:08,280 --> 01:22:11,600
uh... they are are trying to do a little dances

1254
01:22:11,600 --> 01:22:15,960
the devil in their stomachs is popping out of their mouth and going

1255
01:22:15,960 --> 01:22:17,320
like just like

1256
01:22:17,320 --> 01:22:21,160
and uh... getting really excited. Well because there's stuff so there's a seam right down the middle

1257
01:22:21,160 --> 01:22:23,380
right? The devil head pokes out the top

1258
01:22:23,380 --> 01:22:27,640
yes the cooked turkey body yes as we all know

1259
01:22:27,640 --> 01:22:33,040
oh i have to finish changing their attacks a little bit

1260
01:22:33,040 --> 01:22:36,080
Go on, go on, Branson. Tell me what you're doing here.

1261
01:22:36,080 --> 01:22:39,040
Um, so if there's one that's like close to me...

1262
01:22:39,040 --> 01:22:40,480
Hmm, okay.

1263
01:22:40,480 --> 01:22:43,040
I would say so, yeah.

1264
01:22:43,040 --> 01:22:47,760
There's one that's gonna be a little bit closer to you, and then there's two...

1265
01:22:47,760 --> 01:22:53,920
I'd say there's one that's kind of following, and there's a third that's kind of still more interested in like playing in this shit,

1266
01:22:53,920 --> 01:22:55,760
but is like kind of noticing you guys.

1267
01:22:55,760 --> 01:22:59,520
But there is one that's like significantly closer to you compared to the other two.

1268
01:22:59,520 --> 01:23:03,360
Cool, I'm gonna gesture to my like lips like a big like putter there

1269
01:23:03,360 --> 01:23:08,640
to that one and then when he gets closer I want to stab him in the throat.

1270
01:23:08,640 --> 01:23:13,200
That's good. So in that case let's do persuasion with advantage.

1271
01:23:13,200 --> 01:23:15,200
Great. With advantage.

1272
01:23:15,200 --> 01:23:18,480
Oh yeah, you're disguised beautifully.

1273
01:23:18,480 --> 01:23:19,920
Beautifully?

1274
01:23:19,920 --> 01:23:22,000
Really well.

1275
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:23,440
He's seven years old.

1276
01:23:23,440 --> 01:23:28,400
No, no, well that's the character of the third devil, not me.

1277
01:23:28,960 --> 01:23:30,960
We're playing into a dangerous trope here.

1278
01:23:30,960 --> 01:23:32,960
Yeah, likely.

1279
01:23:32,960 --> 01:23:35,960
Okay, that's a 12. I think you got one more.

1280
01:23:35,960 --> 01:23:37,960
Oh, yeah, sorry.

1281
01:23:37,960 --> 01:23:39,960
What do I do with the hit dice? I never...

1282
01:23:39,960 --> 01:23:42,960
Whatever you rolled, you can add them to your HP.

1283
01:23:42,960 --> 01:23:44,960
That's how much you heal.

1284
01:23:44,960 --> 01:23:45,960
Or a 13.

1285
01:23:45,960 --> 01:23:47,960
A 13? Ooh, okay.

1286
01:23:47,960 --> 01:23:50,960
Yeah, I'd say a 13, the devil is kind of like...

1287
01:23:50,960 --> 01:23:53,960
I don't think they, like, are not... don't want to kiss you.

1288
01:23:53,960 --> 01:23:57,960
But they're kind of, like, playing a little bit coy.

1289
01:23:57,960 --> 01:23:59,160
Like this one's good.

1290
01:23:59,160 --> 01:24:02,320
(mimics eating noises)

1291
01:24:02,320 --> 01:24:03,160
(mimics eating noises)

1292
01:24:03,160 --> 01:24:05,440
Like it's not, he's not convinced.

1293
01:24:05,440 --> 01:24:07,960
He's like, oh, like you're, you're, you're,

1294
01:24:07,960 --> 01:24:09,160
you're a saucy dame.

1295
01:24:09,160 --> 01:24:11,840
Let me see what I can get out of this.

1296
01:24:11,840 --> 01:24:15,280
Might have to try something else here.

1297
01:24:15,280 --> 01:24:16,240
- Sure, sure.

1298
01:24:16,240 --> 01:24:20,800
I, I think, and I think, and I'm going to pull the like leg

1299
01:24:20,800 --> 01:24:25,000
of the turkey skin up to reveal like a long shapely leg

1300
01:24:25,000 --> 01:24:26,240
with like a garter.

1301
01:24:26,240 --> 01:24:27,520
- Okay. Hell yes.

1302
01:24:27,520 --> 01:24:28,720
- Okay, wow.

1303
01:24:28,720 --> 01:24:30,000
This is a great disguise self.

1304
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:30,820
Okay, yeah.

1305
01:24:30,820 --> 01:24:33,080
He's coming in for the kiss.

1306
01:24:33,080 --> 01:24:34,040
- Okay, great, yes. - That's enough.

1307
01:24:34,040 --> 01:24:35,600
He wants to start, he's gonna start at your foot,

1308
01:24:35,600 --> 01:24:36,680
you're gonna try to go,

1309
01:24:36,680 --> 01:24:38,880
(imitates kissing)

1310
01:24:38,880 --> 01:24:39,980
you know?

1311
01:24:39,980 --> 01:24:41,360
- Oh, yeah, he's doing like the--

1312
01:24:41,360 --> 01:24:42,840
- Yes, yeah. - Gomez Adams.

1313
01:24:42,840 --> 01:24:44,200
- Yes, precisely.

1314
01:24:44,200 --> 01:24:45,120
- Cool, so as he's doing that,

1315
01:24:45,120 --> 01:24:46,600
I'm gonna just like stab him in the throat.

1316
01:24:46,600 --> 01:24:47,440
- That's good.

1317
01:24:47,440 --> 01:24:48,280
Roll an attack roll.

1318
01:24:48,280 --> 01:24:51,520
- Oh, I'm in the rage, right?

1319
01:24:51,520 --> 01:24:52,640
And I can teleport?

1320
01:24:52,640 --> 01:24:54,320
(Link snorts)

1321
01:24:54,320 --> 01:24:55,160
No?

1322
01:24:55,160 --> 01:24:57,160
- So you have to roll on the table,

1323
01:24:57,160 --> 01:25:00,560
on the wild magic table because it's random

1324
01:25:00,560 --> 01:25:02,800
alright okay you can address that

1325
01:25:02,800 --> 01:25:07,040
in a second my plan was to teleport behind them

1326
01:25:07,040 --> 01:25:09,720
so i guess i can't do that god's got other plans for you

1327
01:25:09,720 --> 01:25:12,060
uh... to as always

1328
01:25:12,060 --> 01:25:13,400
first

1329
01:25:13,400 --> 01:25:16,400
let's see what waylon's got going on over here i got a twelve

1330
01:25:16,400 --> 01:25:17,600
a twelve
