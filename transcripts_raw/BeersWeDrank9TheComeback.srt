- Trulies always make me feel like shit with the stevia.

00:02:10,620 --> 00:02:11,460
It's too much.

69

- Man was not meant to drink any stevia.

00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:19,300
Dude, stevia is for bees to turn into honey.

72
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:20,780
That is not for humans to eat.

73
00:02:20,780 --> 00:02:22,660
- I don't really understand what stevia is.

74
00:02:22,660 --> 00:02:24,540
I thought it was just like healthy sugar.

75
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:27,540
- Stevia is basically like tooth enamel

76
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:31,540
that they scrape off of like one kind of plant in the Amazon

77
00:02:31,540 --> 00:02:34,580
and they've just destroyed, I don't know if this is true,

78
00:02:34,580 --> 00:02:36,740
but I think they've killed millions of people

79
00:02:36,740 --> 00:02:39,580
getting all the crops, the stevia crops.

80
00:02:39,580 --> 00:02:41,180
- But it tastes sweet?

81
00:02:41,180 --> 00:02:43,300
- It tastes sweet for--

82
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:44,140
- Then I don't care.

83
00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:48,020
- And in, no, no, it tastes sweet for an amount of time

84
00:02:48,020 --> 00:02:49,420
that you cannot discern.

85
00:02:49,420 --> 00:02:50,860
It's less, no, don't do that.

(laughing)

87
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:53,840
It tastes sweet for less than a second

88
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,920
and then it is the worst taste ever.

89
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:59,760
Yeah, I used to put stevia in my coffee

90
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:00,560
when I was at the office,

91
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:02,560
but I haven't had this TV in a long time.

00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:05,520

93
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:08,640
a flying slush man,

to the liquor store looking for SpongeBob

101
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:22,540
theme beers?

102
00:03:22,540 --> 00:03:24,640

103
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:26,440
and they had SpongeBob themed beers.

104
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:28,140
And what am I supposed to do?

105
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:28,980
There were six.

106
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:30,640
At some point, they're gonna card you.

107
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:33,300
If you come in and every single time

108
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:35,060
you only buy SpongeBob beer,

109
00:03:35,060 --> 00:03:37,020
they're gonna be like,

110
00:03:37,020 --> 00:03:38,520
"Maybe he's not as old as he looks."

111
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:40,780
No, 'cause I used to come in there

112
00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:43,660
and I would buy the worst vapes they had.

113
00:03:43,660 --> 00:03:46,040
And so he knows me already.

114
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:48,780
In fact, he likes me.

115
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:51,780
When I bought these beers, actually, I will say this.

116
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:56,780
I bought a watermelon like Twizzlers.

117
00:03:56,780 --> 00:04:00,980
Yeah, like and the two SpongeBob beers and he's like,

118
00:04:00,980 --> 00:04:02,880
you're a man with fine taste.

119
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:04,280
Wow.

120
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:06,480
So neither of you have good taste.

121
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:10,780
Yeah, is also complimenting you on Twizzler.

122
00:04:10,780 --> 00:04:14,380
That's your Ellie.

123
00:04:14,380 --> 00:04:15,780
That's my that's my awk dude.

124
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:17,680
Do you eat candy during the day?

125
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:21,280
I'm not going to say no to that.

126
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:25,400
You do, don't you? I've done it. I've done it. God, what am I doing? I've

127
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:29,040
surrounded myself with a grown man who eat candy at 11 in the morning. I eat

128
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:35,240
candy? Oh, I eat candy at 11 in the morning? Yeah. I'm sorry. That's just crazy, dude.

129
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:46,280
Wait, which kind? Swiss Whips? I bought, well, no. I recently, I went to the store and I bought a big bag of Sour Patch Kids.

130
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:49,920
kids, but like a really big bag.

131
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:53,800
And it's been sitting on the kitchen counter near where you get like water.

132
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:59,460
So I'll go in and I'll fill up my water bottle for the day and I'll just kind of

133
00:04:59,460 --> 00:05:00,300
dip my hand.

134
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:04,960

135
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:10,880
Sometimes at night when I'm like, I'm hungry, I should eat dinner.

136
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:14,040
This would be a great time to eat dinner. You know, I'll go in there.

137
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:17,040
I'll kind of look around, poke around and be like, eh,

138
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:20,040
nothing really seems good. Dip my hand in, take five.

139
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:22,200
You're almost not, it's almost completely unconscious.

140
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:26,080
You're just like thinking out loud, talking about dinner. Yeah.

141
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:29,560
Here, I'll show you actually open container. Yeah.

142
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:34,640
I have you guys will notice I'm in, I'm in, uh, I'm in my man cave right now.

143
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:39,200
Yeah. I banished the lady to the bedroom. Oh, let me show you.

144
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:42,320
This is the only candy that I, I just had one actually.

145
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:51,680
I only old lady candy this is dark choc 70% cacao dark chocolate coconut almond

146
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:54,320
butter cups that sounds delicious

147
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:59,120
that's good to have no sugar that's healthy that's that's health food this

148
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:00,200
is not health food

149
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:03,520
it's health food it's dark chocolate

150
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:09,080
I like only old lady candy I only eat like 90% dark chocolate tastes like a

151
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:10,880
cigarette and has almonds in it

152
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:12,880
I don't think you're supposed to be eating any candy.

153
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:16,380
Anything with nut butter, anything with nuts in it is healthy.

154
00:06:16,380 --> 00:06:17,380
Automatically.

155
00:06:17,380 --> 00:06:18,380
Okay.

156
00:06:18,380 --> 00:06:19,380
It could be tiger nuts.

157
00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:20,380
I agree.

158
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:22,380
That's a meal and it's healthy.

159
00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:23,380
Okay.

160
00:06:23,380 --> 00:06:24,380
Almonds, nuts.

161
00:06:24,380 --> 00:06:27,380
That's like the sweetest a meal can get while being healthy.

162
00:06:27,380 --> 00:06:30,380
I'm trying to think of something that disproves this.

163
00:06:30,380 --> 00:06:32,380
I'm having a really rough time actually.

164
00:06:32,380 --> 00:06:33,380
Yeah.

165
00:06:33,380 --> 00:06:36,380
Almost everything that has nuts in it, you're right, is just pure health food.

166
00:06:36,380 --> 00:06:37,380
Right.

167
00:06:37,380 --> 00:06:40,780
I guess, I see I could argue trail mix, but trail mix is, even the ones with M&Ms, it's

168
00:06:40,780 --> 00:06:44,540
good for you. Right. Yeah. It's made to give you quick the M&Ms are there to give you the

169
00:06:44,540 --> 00:06:49,740
quick calories. The sugar is for marathon runners. Right. So when I'm sitting at my

170
00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:55,940
desk haven't moved in seven hours and I get my hand in eat all the M&Ms first. That's

171
00:06:55,940 --> 00:07:01,340
healthy. I've definitely eaten over a thousand calories of trail mix in one sitting. There's

172
00:07:01,340 --> 00:07:06,920
no question. I've eaten probably two thousand calories. Yeah. Which is not that much trail

173
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:12,640
mix honestly. I think I've only had trail mix when I went to New York the one time with Rex.

174
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:16,820
One of the times I went to New York with Rex. Really? Is trail mix not just a common snack

175
00:07:16,820 --> 00:07:22,040
in Mexico? Not really. Well yeah you guys have nuts that have, true. You guys have nuts that

176
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:28,520
have, hey, no I don't want to. There's only trials. No go ahead. Okay I'll say it. Yeah

177
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:30,040
- Yeah, that's it.

178
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:35,040
- Why do you fucking, no, see, I shouldn't say fucking.

179
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:39,680
Why do Mexicans, I was gonna say, why do fucking Mexicans,

180
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:45,080
why do Mexicans put, why do they think everything

181
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:46,660
needs to have red on it?

182
00:07:46,660 --> 00:07:49,480
Sometimes I just want a normal peanut.

183
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:54,440
I don't want a red peanut that has lime dust.

184
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:55,720
See, look how mad he is.

185
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:57,560
- I'm not gonna lie, I was supposed to be like,

186
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:58,620
- No, I was about to say,

187
00:07:58,620 --> 00:08:01,000
that's the stupidest thing you've ever said to me,

188
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,520
but one of my favorite snacks,

189
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:05,680
it's called a hot nut, hot nut.

190
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:06,520
- I bet it is.

191
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:08,000
- It's just like a peanut,

192
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,080
it's just a peanut and it's just like red.

193
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:11,840
- It's a peanut and it's a hot nut.

194
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:14,600
- It's a bag of peanuts and they're red and spicy

195
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:16,360
and they have like lime on it.

196
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:17,800
- Yeah, every single,

197
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:22,600
some Aztecs were walking around finding peanuts and crickets

198
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:24,020
and they're like, those are really cool.

199
00:08:24,020 --> 00:08:25,840
They should be completely red

200
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:30,760
And they should be sold in a bag that has this is 99 cents on the top right.

201
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:33,700
This is a excess of sodio.

202
00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:37,560
Yeah, basically the spectrum of snacks in Mexico.

203
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:38,660
I don't believe that, by the way.

204
00:08:38,660 --> 00:08:40,060
It's red and white.

205
00:08:40,060 --> 00:08:41,300
If it's white, it's sweet.

206
00:08:41,300 --> 00:08:43,100
If it's red, it's spicy.

207
00:08:43,100 --> 00:08:43,600
Right.

208
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:46,840
White is the sweet, like concha.

209
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:49,860
Yeah, like concha, like horchata.

210
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:54,700
I just had some barroco en leche, which is also white.

211
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:56,660
I don't believe in sodio, by the way.

212
00:08:56,660 --> 00:08:59,660
Why do you think I would be the sweetest motherfucker in the world?

213
00:08:59,660 --> 00:09:02,360
OK, sodium is definitely not bad for you.

214
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:03,620
I think it's good for you.

215
00:09:03,620 --> 00:09:04,620
It's good for you.

216
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:07,700
Are you one of these guys who you order food at a restaurant

217
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:08,800
and you don't even taste it?

218
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:11,060
You just start putting salt on it?

219
00:09:11,060 --> 00:09:15,600
No, but I do at it at at an Asian place.

220
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:18,800
Soy sauce, not even tasting it yet.

221
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:22,160
Not to taste. Just dumping soy sauce on it.

222
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:23,460
Yeah, exactly.

223
00:09:23,460 --> 00:09:26,200
You can tell when it comes, if it's not brown.

224
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:29,300
- No, if it doesn't look like it's a soup.

225
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:32,020
- I'm gonna break off of the pack here.

226
00:09:32,020 --> 00:09:34,180
I used to do that, but I haven't done that in years.

227
00:09:34,180 --> 00:09:36,540
And I feel like you need to grow up,

228
00:09:36,540 --> 00:09:38,460
at some point you have to grow up and stop doing that.

229
00:09:38,460 --> 00:09:41,820
- Grow up and stop putting free condiments on.

230
00:09:41,820 --> 00:09:43,980
- It's already spice to taste.

231
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:47,220
- Wait, actually, we just realized that me and Rex

232
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:48,860
do this for completely different reasons.

233
00:09:48,860 --> 00:09:52,100
He's literally pouring salt onto a hamburger

234
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:57,140
french fries and counting how much every single grain of salt is that he's ripping them off for

235
00:09:57,140 --> 00:09:58,980
and me I just like that.

236
00:09:58,980 --> 00:10:04,420
If two pennies, if three pennies, if four pennies.

237
00:10:04,420 --> 00:10:05,860
You're trying to take them for all they have.

238
00:10:05,860 --> 00:10:08,740
Excuse me do you have any more salt packets in the bag?

239
00:10:08,740 --> 00:10:10,260
Kosher salt.

240
00:10:10,260 --> 00:10:12,660
Yeah yeah.

241
00:10:12,660 --> 00:10:14,260
I used to sort of do that at 7-Eleven.

242
00:10:14,260 --> 00:10:16,820
What is kosher salt? Do you know what kosher salt is?

243
00:10:16,820 --> 00:10:20,520
Yes, kosher salt is not necessarily kosher.

244
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:23,120
I just watched an Adam Ragusea video on this, actually.

245
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:26,820
It's not necessarily kosher itself, but it's used for it's

246
00:10:26,820 --> 00:10:31,820
it's it refers to thick, flaky salt that is used for koshering meat.

247
00:10:31,820 --> 00:10:34,720
Interesting, because you got to dry the blood out of the meat.

248
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:36,420
Yeah, yeah, exactly.

249
00:10:36,420 --> 00:10:39,420
Yeah. So, you know, any other questions?

250
00:10:39,420 --> 00:10:43,020
Where do babies come from?

251
00:10:43,020 --> 00:10:48,020
- India.

252
00:10:48,020 --> 00:10:50,280
(laughing)

253
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:52,240
- Well, most of them do.

254
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:57,240
- Yeah, not anymore though, am I right?

255
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:58,880
- What happened to India?

256
00:10:58,880 --> 00:10:59,720
I love India.

257
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:01,760
- It got exploded.

258
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:02,600
- Really?

259
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:05,440
- Did you know that they invented lemonade?

260
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:07,600
- India did?

261
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:08,440
- Yeah, they did.

262
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:09,260
- Get out.

263
00:11:09,260 --> 00:11:11,040
- Did you guys see RRR?

264
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:11,880
- No.

265
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:12,700
- I did.

266
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:16,700
That is probably one of my 15 favorite movies ever.

267
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:19,380
It's so long but it's so much fun.

268
00:11:19,380 --> 00:11:20,700
I had so much fun.

269
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:26,900
I watched it with my brother's father-in-law and he's, I may have told you guys this, he's

270
00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:33,540
like an old guy from Mexico and he doesn't speak a lot of English but I put on the movie,

271
00:11:33,540 --> 00:11:37,260
we were just sitting there watching it and he does this thing when he watches a movie

272
00:11:40,260 --> 00:11:42,220
(imitates hissing)

273
00:11:42,220 --> 00:11:43,620
He like hisses like a snake.

274
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:45,860
(laughing)

275
00:11:45,860 --> 00:11:48,820
And I was like, we were watching,

276
00:11:48,820 --> 00:11:50,120
I just kept hearing that, and I was like,

277
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:51,840
what the fuck is he doing?

278
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:53,700
And then my sister-in-law was like,

279
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:55,360
my dad really likes the movie.

280
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:56,780
(laughing)

281
00:11:56,780 --> 00:11:59,300
'Cause every time somebody would do a back flip,

282
00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:01,020
he would go, (imitates hissing)

283
00:12:01,020 --> 00:12:03,560
- That's so funny, I know exactly what you mean.

284
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:04,580
- You do?

285
00:12:04,580 --> 00:12:05,900
- Yeah, I know.

286
00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:07,620
- Is that a cultural thing?

287
00:12:07,620 --> 00:12:09,220
- I guess, I don't know.

288
00:12:09,220 --> 00:12:10,620
I've never really thought about it much.

289
00:12:10,620 --> 00:12:11,660
- I'd never seen that before,

290
00:12:11,660 --> 00:12:13,380
but I was like, that is so funny,

291
00:12:13,380 --> 00:12:15,260
that that's his reaction, instead of being like,

292
00:12:15,260 --> 00:12:18,220
oh, he's seeing it on TV.

293
00:12:18,220 --> 00:12:19,600
- In my mind, it's like,

294
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:22,620
I don't know, when something's like dramatic,

295
00:12:22,620 --> 00:12:24,780
or like there's like a ooh moment,

296
00:12:24,780 --> 00:12:25,620
it's just like,

297
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:27,140
(imitates dramatic sound)

298
00:12:27,140 --> 00:12:27,980
(laughs)

299
00:12:27,980 --> 00:12:28,800
You go like that.

300
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:30,580
- I thought that he was just weird.

301
00:12:30,580 --> 00:12:31,420
I didn't know.

302
00:12:31,420 --> 00:12:33,860
- Every culture has a specific like,

303
00:12:33,860 --> 00:12:36,300
oh, that they do.

304
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:38,060
- Well, you just did your cultures.

305
00:12:38,060 --> 00:12:40,140
(laughs)

306
00:12:40,140 --> 00:12:42,140
- It's part of the language, it's not racist.

307
00:12:42,140 --> 00:12:43,740
- No, no, no, of course.

308
00:12:43,740 --> 00:12:44,940
- You're very cultured.

309
00:12:44,940 --> 00:12:47,240
- I saw a Mario movie.

310
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:48,080
- How was that?

311
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:48,900
(laughs)

312
00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:51,900
- I felt like I was being advertised to

313
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:55,060
for about 30 minutes.

314
00:12:55,060 --> 00:12:59,660
And then I sat down with myself and I said,

315
00:12:59,660 --> 00:13:01,300
"Stop thinking, what are you doing?

316
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:02,940
You're at the Mario movie."

317
00:13:02,940 --> 00:13:04,100
It was a great time.

318
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:07,020
- I'm sick of watching good movies.

319
00:13:07,020 --> 00:13:08,420
I never want to see a good movie again.

320
00:13:08,420 --> 00:13:11,780
I watched when we were out of town this past weekend.

321
00:13:11,780 --> 00:13:15,420
I watched the four, I think I already told Julio this,

322
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:18,340
but I watched "Bullet Train."

323
00:13:18,340 --> 00:13:19,180
- Okay.

324
00:13:19,180 --> 00:13:22,260
- A plus, amazing movie.

325
00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:26,980
I re-watched "Game Night," A minus, really good movie.

326
00:13:26,980 --> 00:13:30,180
I saw "Fight Club," A minus, or A,

327
00:13:30,180 --> 00:13:32,020
almost as good as "Bullet Train."

328
00:13:32,020 --> 00:13:36,580
And then I saw "Midsommar," C,

329
00:13:36,580 --> 00:13:37,980
That is a C.

330
00:13:37,980 --> 00:13:39,740
That movie, and some people would say

331
00:13:39,740 --> 00:13:40,660
that's the best movie of the bunch.

332
00:13:40,660 --> 00:13:44,180
That movie is poop for girls.

333
00:13:44,180 --> 00:13:46,340
- Yeah, I don't fuck with Ari Aster.

334
00:13:46,340 --> 00:13:50,020
Never really watched this stuff, but--

335
00:13:50,020 --> 00:13:51,540
- You don't see Hereditary?

336
00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:52,520
- Nope.

337
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:55,460
Haven't seen even the Tale of the Johnsons

338
00:13:55,460 --> 00:13:56,580
or whatever it's fucking called.

339
00:13:56,580 --> 00:13:57,420
- Yeah, well, something's wrong

340
00:13:57,420 --> 00:13:58,340
with the Johnsons or whatever.

341
00:13:58,340 --> 00:14:02,540
Yeah, that short film is really disturbing

342
00:14:02,540 --> 00:14:04,980
'cause it does, it's like,

343
00:14:06,020 --> 00:14:07,100
I don't know.

344
00:14:07,100 --> 00:14:08,720
There's something about,

345
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:10,860
it's not disturbing what happens in the movie,

346
00:14:10,860 --> 00:14:12,340
it kind of just gets in your head that you're like,

347
00:14:12,340 --> 00:14:15,440
what if I have a son who just gets bigger than me?

348
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:16,780
Like, that's terrifying.

349
00:14:16,780 --> 00:14:18,980
'Cause then at that point it's like,

350
00:14:18,980 --> 00:14:20,820
yeah, he might as well fucking fuck you all the time.

351
00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:22,580
Like, it doesn't, who cares, right?

352
00:14:22,580 --> 00:14:23,420
Right, what are they gonna do?

353
00:14:23,420 --> 00:14:24,660
You already lost, as soon as your son,

354
00:14:24,660 --> 00:14:26,740
as soon as my son hits 5'10",

355
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:29,580
which by the way, I'm specially breeding

356
00:14:29,580 --> 00:14:31,340
to make sure that happens.

357
00:14:31,340 --> 00:14:32,180
Right.

358
00:14:32,180 --> 00:14:33,020
I'm done.

359
00:14:33,020 --> 00:14:34,540
He's the dad now.

360
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:35,380
Yeah, there's nothing I can do.

361
00:14:35,380 --> 00:14:36,580
- Get a job.

362
00:14:36,580 --> 00:14:37,420
- Yeah, exactly.

363
00:14:37,420 --> 00:14:38,820
I'm gonna be-- - That's what I would say.

364
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:41,780
First time my son says, "Dad, I'm taller than you,"

365
00:14:41,780 --> 00:14:43,820
I'm gonna say, "Yeah, get a job."

366
00:14:43,820 --> 00:14:45,980
- He's gonna tell me to get a job.

367
00:14:45,980 --> 00:14:47,420
That's what I'm scared of,

368
00:14:47,420 --> 00:14:49,540
is that I'm gonna be doing chores.

369
00:14:49,540 --> 00:14:50,380
I'm gonna get grounded. - I'm gonna start paying

370
00:14:50,380 --> 00:14:51,460
you rent. - I'm gonna be like,

371
00:14:51,460 --> 00:14:53,540
"You can't ground me," and he'll walk up to me,

372
00:14:53,540 --> 00:14:57,180
and I'm gonna be like tit height at him,

373
00:14:57,180 --> 00:15:00,780
and he's gonna be like, "You sure about that, little guy?"

374
00:15:00,780 --> 00:15:01,620
- He's gonna start going-- - And I'll go,

375
00:15:01,620 --> 00:15:03,900
"I don't know." - "Don't make me count to three."

376
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:06,340
'Cause literally, yeah, yeah, yeah, go to your room.

377
00:15:06,340 --> 00:15:07,660
I don't wanna go to my room.

378
00:15:07,660 --> 00:15:08,960
Go to your room.

379
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:10,220
I wanna watch TV.

380
00:15:10,220 --> 00:15:12,660
Okay, I'll go to my, whatever.

381
00:15:12,660 --> 00:15:13,480
I'll go to my room.

382
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:14,860
- I'll watch TV with your mother.

383
00:15:14,860 --> 00:15:17,420
- Yeah, I'm gonna watch TV with mom.

384
00:15:17,420 --> 00:15:19,100
No, that scares me, man.

385
00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:21,660
- Yeah, I mean, obviously, I would want,

386
00:15:21,660 --> 00:15:25,740
if I had a son, for him to be happy, healthy, taller,

387
00:15:25,740 --> 00:15:26,860
bigger dick, just ever,

388
00:15:26,860 --> 00:15:29,500
just full upgrade of the bunch, right?

389
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:30,820
- Nah.

390
00:15:30,820 --> 00:15:33,180
- But that would suck.

391
00:15:33,180 --> 00:15:36,620
- Yeah, I don't want to be like really badly disabled.

392
00:15:36,620 --> 00:15:40,540
- Okay, go on, I'm listening.

393
00:15:40,540 --> 00:15:42,420
- Well, you know, not really,

394
00:15:42,420 --> 00:15:46,420
but I guess that would solve that one single problem.

395
00:15:46,420 --> 00:15:48,380
- Yeah, you could then beat your son

396
00:15:48,380 --> 00:15:49,260
no matter how big it is.

397
00:15:49,260 --> 00:15:51,180
- Well, I wouldn't even need to, you know?

398
00:15:51,180 --> 00:15:52,020
- Right.

399
00:15:52,020 --> 00:15:53,300
- But maybe I'll just,

400
00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:55,380
I think I talked to somebody about this recently.

401
00:15:55,380 --> 00:15:58,060
I think that I should raise a wimp.

402
00:15:58,060 --> 00:15:59,780
I think I need to raise a wimp.

403
00:15:59,780 --> 00:16:00,620
- Yeah, I was about to ask,

404
00:16:00,620 --> 00:16:02,500
will you guys do the thing where like

405
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:08,420
the Reddit parents are like, "I'm going to show my kid Game of Thrones and Final Fantasy

406
00:16:08,420 --> 00:16:09,420
and all that shit."

407
00:16:09,420 --> 00:16:10,420
I'm going to be worse.

408
00:16:10,420 --> 00:16:14,340
I'm going to be Dr. Horrible sing-along blog, doing that kind of shit, showing them.

409
00:16:14,340 --> 00:16:22,500
I'm going to show them what's the fucking D&D web series.

410
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:23,500
I'm going to show them that.

411
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:24,500
I'm going to show them the Nerdist.

412
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:25,500
I'm going to be really…

413
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:26,500
I'm going to be a bad, bad parent.

414
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:27,500
Red versus blue?

415
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:29,180
I'm going to show them red versus blue.

416
00:16:29,180 --> 00:16:33,180
Red vs. Blue might be too funny and too for guys, honestly, for my wimp kid.

417
00:16:33,180 --> 00:16:35,140
OK, I'm going to show him

418
00:16:35,140 --> 00:16:38,280
girls.

419
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:39,580
What about Good Mythical Morning?

420
00:16:39,580 --> 00:16:43,080
Is that I will be showing my child I will be wearing.

421
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:46,240
We're going to sit down every single night to watch the new Good Mythical Morning

422
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:49,140
where they eat a fart flavored hot dog.

423
00:16:49,140 --> 00:16:53,320
And I will be covering my eyes and my ears so that none of it gets into my head.

424
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:56,480
But my kid is going to be completely like stuck to the TV.

425
00:16:57,120 --> 00:17:03,480
I'm going to record Coco Melon onto a VHS and force him to watch that until he's 17 years

426
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:04,480
old.

427
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:05,480
Yeah.

428
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:06,480
I'm going to pretend that's school.

429
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:11,380
I'm going to tell my kid he's homeschooled and make him watch the same four Coco Melon

430
00:17:11,380 --> 00:17:14,040
things until he's graduated.

431
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:20,480
And then just one day just be like, just drop him off at the SAT and make him take it.

432
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:22,080
And he'll just completely ace it.

433
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:24,960
What's stopping someone from just doing that to a kid?

434
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:25,960
Nothing.

435
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:26,960
Literally nothing.

436
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:31,760
Yeah, no, you can get – basically you can get – trust me, I'm very intimately familiar

437
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:33,700
with homeschooling in America.

438
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:42,900
You can get what is essentially like audited by – I guess it's Child Protective Services,

439
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:48,780
but they can come through and say like, "Okay, what are you teaching your kid?"

440
00:17:48,780 --> 00:17:51,620
And if you say like, "I'm teaching them basically nothing.

441
00:17:51,620 --> 00:17:53,740
They're looking at their phone all day."

442
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:56,860
Yeah, but at what point does that happen?

443
00:17:56,860 --> 00:18:01,260
Because you can just, I mean, how many years does it have to pass for them to be like,

444
00:18:01,260 --> 00:18:07,660
"Hey, this kid that was registered as born 10 years ago hasn't been registered anywhere."

445
00:18:07,660 --> 00:18:10,780
So it depends on the state. In North Carolina, we had to do

446
00:18:10,780 --> 00:18:17,180
EOGs, which were the same tests that they administered to kids in public school at

447
00:18:17,180 --> 00:18:21,580
the end of the year, like basically just standardized testing. We had to do it and

448
00:18:21,580 --> 00:18:31,260
send it in via mail. And if you just colored in all the O's and P's and sent it back, then

449
00:18:31,260 --> 00:18:34,660
they would be like, "Okay, there's a serious problem." But I knew some people whose parents

450
00:18:34,660 --> 00:18:38,700
would just fill that out for them and then send it back because they didn't want to like...

451
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:39,700
Smart.

452
00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:40,700
Yeah.

453
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:46,260
School doesn't matter anymore because of the AI stuff.

454
00:18:46,260 --> 00:18:47,260
Yeah, TikTok.

455
00:18:47,260 --> 00:18:48,260
Yes.

456
00:18:48,260 --> 00:18:49,260
Yeah, TikTok, the algorithm.

457
00:18:49,260 --> 00:18:50,260
Yeah.

458
00:18:50,260 --> 00:18:52,600
Yeah, you can learn everything there.

459
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:55,960
I don't think you can learn much on TikTok.

460
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:56,960
No, you can't.

461
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:58,160
You can learn about giants.

462
00:18:58,160 --> 00:18:59,260
You can.

463
00:18:59,260 --> 00:19:00,160
That is true.

464
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:03,860
You can learn about how to fight a dog.

465
00:19:03,860 --> 00:19:04,560
Yep.

466
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:07,760
Yeah, somebody told me a dog fighting story.

467
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:09,760
Not dog fighting, but they got fought.

468
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:10,960
They got bit by a dog.

469
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:12,760
They got into a fight.

470
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:14,060
They got lost.

471
00:19:14,060 --> 00:19:14,660
They got...

472
00:19:14,660 --> 00:19:15,460
Pretty much, yeah.

473
00:19:15,460 --> 00:19:17,160
They got fought by a dog.

474
00:19:18,460 --> 00:19:21,820
Some crazy dog fought my mom.

475
00:19:21,820 --> 00:19:29,740
But yeah, he was telling me that a dog, he was a very nice guy, but he really messed

476
00:19:29,740 --> 00:19:30,740
up.

477
00:19:30,740 --> 00:19:37,980
He stayed at an Airbnb for 10 days, and day two, I think he said, he was walking outside.

478
00:19:37,980 --> 00:19:43,980
It was like an Airbnb on the property of the house, the owner.

479
00:19:43,980 --> 00:19:55,980
He said that he was walking outside to his car and their pit bull named Sergeant ran

480
00:19:55,980 --> 00:20:01,060
up and bit his knee and like drew blood.

481
00:20:01,060 --> 00:20:04,580
He ended and he was like, "Oh my God, did you get money?

482
00:20:04,580 --> 00:20:05,580
What the fuck?

483
00:20:05,580 --> 00:20:06,580
That's crazy."

484
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:07,580
He was like bragging.

485
00:20:07,580 --> 00:20:11,540
He was like, "Yeah, yeah, I basically got a refund for the whole Airbnb."

486
00:20:11,540 --> 00:20:13,860
I was like, "Are you kidding?

487
00:20:13,860 --> 00:20:17,500
- Dude, sue him for $15,000, okay?

488
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:19,380
Do you realize how cut and dry of a case that is?

489
00:20:19,380 --> 00:20:20,220
- It is.

490
00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:23,480
- Yeah, I got attacked by a pit bull in true blood

491
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:25,820
and his name was Sargent.

492
00:20:25,820 --> 00:20:26,660
- It has a crew cut.

493
00:20:26,660 --> 00:20:27,820
- He was bred to kill.

494
00:20:27,820 --> 00:20:30,180
Yeah, exactly, he has prison tattoos

495
00:20:30,180 --> 00:20:32,780
all over his fucking paws.

496
00:20:32,780 --> 00:20:33,620
It's like, dude, that is such a layup.

497
00:20:33,620 --> 00:20:35,820
- He's covered in teardrop tattoos.

498
00:20:35,820 --> 00:20:40,260
- Yeah, like, it's not, I just couldn't believe it.

499
00:20:40,260 --> 00:20:41,500
- That happened to my mom. - Yeah, exactly.

500
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:44,400
and she like milked the,

501
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:48,900
she was in rehab.

502
00:20:48,900 --> 00:20:50,500
- Yeah, let's like milk your mom.

503
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:51,340
- Relax, relax.

504
00:20:51,340 --> 00:20:54,820
She was in physical therapy for like eight months after.

505
00:20:54,820 --> 00:20:55,660
Like, oh, I can't work.

506
00:20:55,660 --> 00:20:56,480
- Oh my God.

507
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:57,320
- Because she got milked?

508
00:20:57,320 --> 00:20:58,780
- No.

509
00:20:58,780 --> 00:21:00,700
- She would be after I milked her.

510
00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:01,540
- All right.

511
00:21:01,540 --> 00:21:05,740
- I'd be wearing those big yellow kitchen gloves

512
00:21:05,740 --> 00:21:06,580
and I'd be milking your mom.

513
00:21:06,580 --> 00:21:08,340
- Yeah, I'm talking about milking my fucking mom.

514
00:21:08,340 --> 00:21:09,180
- I would've used a device.

515
00:21:09,180 --> 00:21:11,220
I would've used a machine.

516
00:21:11,220 --> 00:21:12,680
- You just plug her in.

517
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:14,420
- Don't worry, I would not be milking her

518
00:21:14,420 --> 00:21:16,320
into any sort of bottle or jar.

519
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:19,960
I'd be milking that disgusting shit directly into the trash.

520
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:22,640
(laughing)

521
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:25,480
I literally would just not want it anywhere near anybody.

522
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:27,600
So I would be doing the entire world a favor.

523
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:30,340
I'd be, yeah, I'd be throwing it into a,

524
00:21:30,340 --> 00:21:33,080
one of those toxic waste bags that they put needles in

525
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:33,920
at the doctor's office.

526
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:34,800
- Into the ocean.

527
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:36,000
- Yeah, exactly.

528
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,280
It's a dolphin's problem now.

529
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:39,360
I don't care about the milk.

530
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:40,280
- I do think it's also,

531
00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:42,880
I walked the beach the other day

532
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:46,200
and there's just needle drop-offs over there.

533
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:47,320
And I'm like, that's nice.

534
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:51,080
'Cause that's a great place to use intravenous drugs,

535
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:52,840
I think is like on the beach.

536
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:54,720
- Imagine how relaxing that is.

537
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:55,680
- Amazing.

538
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:57,800
They should get to do that.

539
00:21:57,800 --> 00:21:59,320
- Yeah, who cares?

540
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:01,440
- Not the Long Beach Beach.

541
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:03,320
I wasn't very relaxed.

542
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:04,960
- Definitely the Long Beach Beach.

543
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:07,280
- It's very stressful.

544
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:11,100
- Are you excited to not live near any homeless people again?

545
00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:14,260
Are you excited to escape them?

546
00:22:14,260 --> 00:22:16,140
- Yeah, I can't wait to go to New York

547
00:22:16,140 --> 00:22:17,620
where there's no homeless people.

548
00:22:17,620 --> 00:22:19,620
- There's no homeless people around here.

549
00:22:19,620 --> 00:22:24,060
There's one guy that I think, this is actually,

550
00:22:24,060 --> 00:22:27,180
I can't believe I haven't told you guys this yet.

551
00:22:27,180 --> 00:22:29,540
There's a restaurant around here that--

552
00:22:29,540 --> 00:22:30,940
- With a homeless guy, Chuck?

553
00:22:30,940 --> 00:22:34,440
- What's, that would be amazing.

554
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:36,180
There's a restaurant around here,

555
00:22:36,180 --> 00:22:38,020
I don't even know if like,

556
00:22:38,020 --> 00:22:40,220
this is just me telling this story,

557
00:22:40,220 --> 00:22:45,100
but like it has a detail that I don't want to recreate,

558
00:22:45,100 --> 00:22:46,900
but I think I have to.

559
00:22:46,900 --> 00:22:49,980
There's this guy who, when you eat at this restaurant,

560
00:22:49,980 --> 00:22:51,140
he walks up and he says,

561
00:22:51,140 --> 00:22:55,100
"Hey, do you guys have any money?

562
00:22:55,100 --> 00:22:57,560
I'd like to get something to eat."

563
00:22:57,560 --> 00:23:00,360
And you say no, and then he leaves.

564
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:01,860
And I've eaten at this restaurant

565
00:23:01,860 --> 00:23:04,860
almost every single time this guy's walked up and done this.

566
00:23:04,860 --> 00:23:07,180
But last night I went to this restaurant

567
00:23:07,180 --> 00:23:09,320
and he walked up and he started doing,

568
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:13,500
he started doing a voice like he's mentally disabled.

569
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:15,760
(laughing)

570
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:19,020
Which he did not have before.

571
00:23:19,020 --> 00:23:24,540
And then when I said, "No, sorry, I don't have any money,"

572
00:23:24,540 --> 00:23:27,380
he started going like, "Uhh,"

573
00:23:27,380 --> 00:23:28,620
(laughing)

574
00:23:28,620 --> 00:23:30,140
pretend crying.

575
00:23:30,140 --> 00:23:32,420
And I was like--

576
00:23:32,420 --> 00:23:34,260
- That's such a good one.

577
00:23:34,260 --> 00:23:41,060
That's so crazy that he thought that he could pull a fast one

578
00:23:41,060 --> 00:23:44,180
and pretend that he was always like that.

579
00:23:44,180 --> 00:23:48,180
But he used to just come up and be like, "Hey, do you have any money for food?"

580
00:23:48,180 --> 00:23:52,540
Yeah, and then you were like, "I caught you. I caught you.

581
00:23:52,540 --> 00:23:55,540
I always see you around here. I never give you money."

582
00:23:55,540 --> 00:23:57,460
A neuro-impaired fellow.

583
00:23:57,460 --> 00:23:58,460
Who's the good guy?

584
00:23:58,460 --> 00:24:00,060
Yeah, exactly. So I called the cops on him.

585
00:24:00,060 --> 00:24:01,540
Yeah, you should.

586
00:24:01,540 --> 00:24:03,500
That's disgusting.

587
00:24:03,860 --> 00:24:05,100
- I think it's cool.

588
00:24:05,100 --> 00:24:07,180
- If he did that, I would give him $10.

589
00:24:07,180 --> 00:24:10,660
- Yeah, I was like, okay, this guy's actually about his shit.

590
00:24:10,660 --> 00:24:11,980
Like, that's cool.

591
00:24:11,980 --> 00:24:12,820
- Yeah.

592
00:24:12,820 --> 00:24:13,640
- And it also made me think--

593
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:16,140
- You're not truly homeless and begging for money

594
00:24:16,140 --> 00:24:18,580
until you're also pretending to be retarded.

595
00:24:18,580 --> 00:24:19,980
- Exactly, yeah.

596
00:24:19,980 --> 00:24:21,900
Yeah, it was such an advanced move.

597
00:24:21,900 --> 00:24:24,620
I was like, I can't believe I've never seen that before.

598
00:24:24,620 --> 00:24:26,420
I've seen fake veteran.

599
00:24:26,420 --> 00:24:27,260
- Yeah.

600
00:24:27,260 --> 00:24:30,320
- I've seen fake, faking like you lost your legs.

601
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:32,140
You know, you're just sitting on them.

602
00:24:32,140 --> 00:24:32,980
- Right.

603
00:24:32,980 --> 00:24:37,740
this guy just going full just dee dee dee,

604
00:24:37,740 --> 00:24:38,780
Carlos Macias style.

605
00:24:38,780 --> 00:24:40,500
- Yeah, dee dee dee.

606
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:41,820
- Right in front of me,

607
00:24:41,820 --> 00:24:44,860
like I didn't see him two weeks ago,

608
00:24:44,860 --> 00:24:46,560
asking me, calling me sir.

609
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:48,920
It's just crazy.

610
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:50,540
- It'd be funny if he like got hit by a car

611
00:24:50,540 --> 00:24:51,700
and that's what it's from.

612
00:24:51,700 --> 00:24:52,740
- That's what I was like,

613
00:24:52,740 --> 00:24:53,660
I was like looking, I was like,

614
00:24:53,660 --> 00:24:55,660
is there like, does he have like a fucking

615
00:24:55,660 --> 00:24:57,260
Tom and Jerry lump on his head?

616
00:24:57,260 --> 00:24:59,220
- Yeah, the only like solution for this

617
00:24:59,220 --> 00:25:01,840
is you have to go back tomorrow night

618
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:04,700
and you have to eat, get approached by him,

619
00:25:04,700 --> 00:25:06,120
and also give him no money,

620
00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:09,080
but see if he does a new routine.

621
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:09,920
Maybe he switches it up.

622
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:10,840
- Yeah, exactly.

623
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:12,480
- Like every week he switches it up.

624
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:15,920
Like next week he'll be like from Dominican Republic.

625
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:17,160
- What if he's just a character?

626
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:18,840
Like he's just trying to get discovered.

627
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:20,280
You know, like he's an actor.

628
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:21,680
- Just shows up and he's Obama.

629
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:22,840
He's doing the Obama voice.

630
00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:23,680
(laughing)

631
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:24,720
- He's too impressive.

632
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:26,160
(laughing)

633
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:28,440
Just seeing which one people give more money to.

634
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:29,900
It's kind of a good idea.

635
00:25:29,900 --> 00:25:33,340
But yeah, I just couldn't believe that, dude.

636
00:25:33,340 --> 00:25:37,060
I was like, that is just, that's very cool.

637
00:25:37,060 --> 00:25:39,020
- Yeah. - Yeah, that's a great move.

638
00:25:39,020 --> 00:25:40,060
- That's messed up.

639
00:25:40,060 --> 00:25:40,900
Speaking of Obama impressions. - I'm keeping that one

640
00:25:40,900 --> 00:25:43,300
in my back pocket 'til when I'm homeless.

641
00:25:43,300 --> 00:25:44,860
- Speaking of Obama impressions.

642
00:25:44,860 --> 00:25:46,460
- It's coming. - You're never gonna be homeless.

643
00:25:46,460 --> 00:25:50,100
You're gonna be sent to jail for doing gay crimes.

644
00:25:50,100 --> 00:25:51,300
- Yeah. - All right, all right.

645
00:25:51,300 --> 00:25:54,580
- You will either be sent to jail or murdered by a SWAT team.

646
00:25:54,580 --> 00:25:56,620
Those are the two options.

647
00:25:56,620 --> 00:25:58,740
Or you will accidentally click one button

648
00:25:58,740 --> 00:26:01,340
and have 500 people pay to have you killed.

649
00:26:01,340 --> 00:26:04,640
All of these are very true.

650
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:07,140
I think that's the one that's going to actually going to happen.

651
00:26:07,140 --> 00:26:08,820
Yeah. The last one.

652
00:26:08,820 --> 00:26:11,580
Yeah, it'll be like fucking it'll be Mr.

653
00:26:11,580 --> 00:26:12,040
and Mrs.

654
00:26:12,040 --> 00:26:15,260
Smith style assassins competing to kill you.

655
00:26:15,260 --> 00:26:19,320
None of those things are out of the you know.

656
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:20,960
Yeah, definitely.

657
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:23,020
All within the realm of possibility.

658
00:26:23,020 --> 00:26:25,860
Yeah. Wait, which movie is Game Night?

659
00:26:25,860 --> 00:26:31,520
Game night is Fokker and what's his name from Arrested Development.

660
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:35,620
Rachel, what's her name from the Notebook?

661
00:26:35,620 --> 00:26:42,260
The guy from the dude from New Girl

662
00:26:42,260 --> 00:26:47,040
and that's kind of oh, and then the

663
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:49,640
the guy who plays football coaches and a lot of things.

664
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:54,040
So it's really nice with the like, just just put together

665
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:57,520
like much like B-tier actors and they just like do something kind of fun,

666
00:26:57,520 --> 00:26:58,360
but it's not that good.

667
00:26:58,360 --> 00:27:01,560
No, no, no. It's actually really good. It's like a, uh,

668
00:27:01,560 --> 00:27:06,480
it's a, I highly recommend it actually. It's very funny.

669
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:10,140
And also it's like one of the few comedies that has like a cool kind of

670
00:27:10,140 --> 00:27:13,520
direction style. Um, oh, and, and, uh,

671
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:17,280
what's his name from Todd from breaking bad. Isn't it? And he's great.

672
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:21,920
Okay. I saw it in the theaters and it was a riot.

673
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:28,920
Speaking of rats, did you see those people on Twitter doing astro-turfing for "Bo is

674
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:29,920
Afraid"?

675
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:30,920
No, that's the worst.

676
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:34,420
No, I think that movie is probably going to be pretty shit.

677
00:27:34,420 --> 00:27:36,900
I'm sure I would like it if I watched it.

678
00:27:36,900 --> 00:27:40,000
Was it the people, they were like, "I was at the theater and somebody stood up and said,

679
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,500
'What the fuck is this movie?'"

680
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:42,500
Yeah, that.

681
00:27:42,500 --> 00:27:47,700
I think that's so, I think they like paid that homeless guy like $10.

682
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:51,880
Nobody is going to fucking, who gives a shit about a movie?

683
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:55,680
I've seen awful movies and never once have I stood up and gone,

684
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:58,400
that was the worst movie I've ever seen.

685
00:27:58,400 --> 00:28:01,600
Have you guys ever walked out of a movie? No, no.

686
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:07,120
I walked out of Steve Carell dinner for schmucks and I walked out of the pre the

687
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:11,280
2018 predator movie.

688
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:15,960
I think, wait, why? Maybe it did.

689
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:17,680
Explain why you would walk out of a movie.

690
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:20,040
I don't understand the logic of walking out.

691
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:23,680
Two very different reasons, but I did technically walk out of them.

692
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:24,680
I'm ready.

693
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:25,680
I'm ready.

694
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:26,800
Dinner for schmucks.

695
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:27,800
I went and saw it with my mom.

696
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:29,300
I was 12 years old.

697
00:28:29,300 --> 00:28:31,820
She saw a nipple and said, "We have to leave the theater."

698
00:28:31,820 --> 00:28:33,600
So I count that as walking out.

699
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:34,600
Yeah.

700
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:40,600
Predator is because I got a phone call from my professor that I was actively missing a

701
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:45,520
class, so I left the movie theater to go to the class.

702
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:47,040
You did just call you directly?

703
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:48,040
That's crazy.

704
00:28:48,040 --> 00:28:49,040
I what?

705
00:28:49,040 --> 00:28:52,000
- They would call you for you were missing a class?

706
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:55,000
- He was like a four person class

707
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,240
and he was a cool professor.

708
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:57,080
- Oh, okay.

709
00:28:57,080 --> 00:28:59,680
- Yeah, and the movie theater was in the same building.

710
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:01,680
- It was a cool professor

711
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:03,880
and he used to text me all the time.

712
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:04,720
- I did, he used to text with me.

713
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:06,920
- He used to chat when I was underage.

714
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:08,620
- I loved him, his name was Andre.

715
00:29:08,620 --> 00:29:10,960
- I think, wait, now that I think about it,

716
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:12,560
I think I may have walked out of the movie

717
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:15,640
because it was too long and I had to be somewhere.

718
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:16,480
- That's a classic reason.

719
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:20,680
And I think that movie was one of the Batman ones,

720
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:22,180
the one that was really long.

721
00:29:22,180 --> 00:29:24,180
I don't know if you like Dark Knight Rises.

722
00:29:24,180 --> 00:29:26,180
Yeah, Dark Knight Rises is the long one.

723
00:29:26,180 --> 00:29:28,180
Yeah, I mean, I liked all of them,

724
00:29:28,180 --> 00:29:31,480
but I was forced to walk out of it

725
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:33,480
because I was running late for something.

726
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:35,480
That... Dude.

727
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:39,180
You know what? It's not even worth saying.

728
00:29:39,180 --> 00:29:41,680
I was going to just say The Dark Knight is such a good movie.

729
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:43,680
[LAUGHTER]

730
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:45,680
It's like, yeah, that's good radio.

731
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:49,000
- That's amazing, that's amazing podcasting.

732
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:50,840
- That movie is so good.

733
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:53,520
- The Dark Knight is so good, it actually is dude.

734
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:55,200
The beginning scene when the grenade pops,

735
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:57,480
when he pulls the pin on the grenade and it's smoke

736
00:29:57,480 --> 00:29:59,880
and you go, "Ah, wait."

737
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:01,400
He just wants to be weird.

738
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:05,900
- I can't think of the other one,

739
00:30:05,900 --> 00:30:08,840
of the Dark Knight trilogy without thinking of that.

740
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:10,520
- Batman Begins.

741
00:30:10,520 --> 00:30:11,780
- The last one.

742
00:30:11,780 --> 00:30:13,600
I just, whenever I think about it,

743
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:18,300
I just like started like speaking like Bane to Rex for like the for like the next three nights

744
00:30:18,300 --> 00:30:24,940
What is that

745
00:30:24,940 --> 00:30:30,560
Do you know skeptic the rapper skeptic

746
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:32,360
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

747
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:33,600
What the fuck is he talking about?

748
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:34,900
Something racist.

749
00:30:34,900 --> 00:30:36,060
There's no.

750
00:30:36,060 --> 00:30:37,400
Oh, you were.

751
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:41,100
Yeah, I can tell you guys are saying something very racist.

752
00:30:41,100 --> 00:30:45,460
It's a little bit of a battle rap.

753
00:30:45,460 --> 00:30:49,260
And the guy comes up and he's like, Skepta,

754
00:30:49,260 --> 00:30:52,800
you look like you have AIDS, you look like you have HIV.

755
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:55,220
We keep saying that to each other.

756
00:30:55,220 --> 00:30:57,220
I don't know this battle rap.

757
00:30:57,220 --> 00:30:58,460
It's a classic.

758
00:30:58,460 --> 00:31:00,740
He says it's a clip from like a, yeah,

759
00:31:00,740 --> 00:31:04,540
it's a clip from like one of those Red Bull like music academy type things where

760
00:31:04,540 --> 00:31:09,500
like, Oh yeah, yeah. He's like, I'm thinking about this guy, you know,

761
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:12,100
thinking, you know, like he's just like, yeah, I'm going to,

762
00:31:12,100 --> 00:31:16,420
what's the one rapper, what's the one that's like on the dot or something?

763
00:31:16,420 --> 00:31:21,580
Dot battle rapping. I don't know. I used to watch these all the time.

764
00:31:21,580 --> 00:31:23,540
I used to love battle rap.

765
00:31:26,100 --> 00:31:29,780
They're really good and I think Ballarat in Mexico has been having some a moment,

766
00:31:29,780 --> 00:31:32,180
but I haven't really tuned into it at all.

767
00:31:32,180 --> 00:31:39,580
Did you see that the Mexican ice spice ripoff that wraps over the one theme?

768
00:31:39,580 --> 00:31:40,780
No, but that's cool.

769
00:31:40,780 --> 00:31:41,780
What? What is it?

770
00:31:41,780 --> 00:31:43,380
I saw it on Twitter.

771
00:31:43,380 --> 00:31:46,180
No, is she beautiful?

772
00:31:46,180 --> 00:31:49,820
She looks like the other girl from the ice spice video.

773
00:31:49,820 --> 00:31:52,580
What other girl like Pink Panther is?

774
00:31:52,580 --> 00:31:53,460
Yeah, that one.

775
00:31:53,460 --> 00:31:54,740
I love Pink Panther is.

776
00:31:55,100 --> 00:31:56,900
Yeah. I think I'm in love with her.

777
00:31:56,900 --> 00:32:01,180
Oh, she's, she's so pretty.

778
00:32:01,180 --> 00:32:03,460
Well, I got long hair.

779
00:32:03,460 --> 00:32:04,300
What?

780
00:32:04,300 --> 00:32:05,940
She's British.

781
00:32:05,940 --> 00:32:08,820
Are you for real?

782
00:32:08,820 --> 00:32:10,900
I'm completely for real.

783
00:32:10,900 --> 00:32:12,300
What?

784
00:32:12,300 --> 00:32:18,020
There was, there's a clip going around recently where she's, she's on stage

785
00:32:18,020 --> 00:32:23,340
doing like a really bad show to like five people and she's like, I'm British.

786
00:32:23,460 --> 00:32:27,260
start cheering and they're giving him, her nothing at all.

787
00:32:27,260 --> 00:32:33,100
That is such a fucking awful place to be from. Yeah. It's so,

788
00:32:33,100 --> 00:32:35,220
it's so like, you know, I feel like anytime,

789
00:32:35,220 --> 00:32:37,580
if you ever felt like this with British people in America,

790
00:32:37,580 --> 00:32:41,300
when you see British people in America and they all are working like service

791
00:32:41,300 --> 00:32:46,300
jobs, they all are waiters or like yesterday I went to a museum and the,

792
00:32:46,300 --> 00:32:51,700
the clerk at the front was a British guy and I walked up to him and I could just

793
00:32:51,700 --> 00:32:53,980
tell he thinks he's in a movie.

794
00:32:53,980 --> 00:32:57,900
Yeah, literally sitting there and he's like, I don't like

795
00:32:57,900 --> 00:33:01,140
taught. He thinks he's in a fucking movie about his life as

796
00:33:01,140 --> 00:33:05,620
a British guy in America. It's like suck my balls, bro. I live

797
00:33:05,620 --> 00:33:08,620
to a better country and you became worse than our worst

798
00:33:08,620 --> 00:33:09,860
Americans just by

799
00:33:09,860 --> 00:33:13,580
have this this thought today about how America is just like

800
00:33:13,580 --> 00:33:17,740
so much more bigger than the UK like at this point, like they

801
00:33:17,740 --> 00:33:24,780
They think they're like a huge country, like a big power, but I feel like they're completely

802
00:33:24,780 --> 00:33:25,780
–

803
00:33:25,780 --> 00:33:26,780
They suck.

804
00:33:26,780 --> 00:33:27,780
– overtaken by anywhere else.

805
00:33:27,780 --> 00:33:28,780
They suck.

806
00:33:28,780 --> 00:33:31,020
That's the other thing about British people is they're like – they think Americans

807
00:33:31,020 --> 00:33:32,020
are stupid.

808
00:33:32,020 --> 00:33:35,820
It's like, yes, we have a lot more stupid people because we have 10 times the amount

809
00:33:35,820 --> 00:33:37,460
of people that you do.

810
00:33:37,460 --> 00:33:39,660
So we also have 10 times the amount of smart people.

811
00:33:39,660 --> 00:33:42,980
Actually, I would say we have 20 times the amount of smart people because there's not

812
00:33:42,980 --> 00:33:46,700
very many in the great UK.

813
00:33:46,700 --> 00:33:53,420
also let's just call it Britain it's not very great to me yeah damn very united

814
00:33:53,420 --> 00:33:59,060
either I'd like to yeah and it's hardly a kingdom yeah

815
00:33:59,060 --> 00:34:10,860
yeah well no they don't hold on King now oh yeah she completely got shot in a

816
00:34:10,860 --> 00:34:16,860
Yeah, really fucking funny to joke about her death.

817
00:34:16,860 --> 00:34:17,860
Super funny.

818
00:34:17,860 --> 00:34:18,860
Yeah.

819
00:34:18,860 --> 00:34:19,860
Especially when she died from the vaccine.

820
00:34:19,860 --> 00:34:23,920
To actually joke about a human being's death who literally died because she took the Johnson

821
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:24,920
and Johnson vaccine.

822
00:34:24,920 --> 00:34:27,860
She was the first person to get it and her heart stopped because there was a bubble.

823
00:34:27,860 --> 00:34:29,860
There's a bubble in that vaccine.

824
00:34:29,860 --> 00:34:32,900
You get the bubble vaccine.

825
00:34:32,900 --> 00:34:40,220
My dad called me when the, it was that like fucking Fox News, like that Fox News story

826
00:34:40,220 --> 00:34:44,660
that was like, the Johnson & Johnson vaccine is like, a lady dies from a stroke from it

827
00:34:44,660 --> 00:34:45,660
or whatever.

828
00:34:45,660 --> 00:34:48,140
Like the first one, like a couple years ago.

829
00:34:48,140 --> 00:34:49,140
Yeah.

830
00:34:49,140 --> 00:34:51,740
Because Johnson & Johnson was the first one where you could just get one shot and that

831
00:34:51,740 --> 00:34:52,740
was it.

832
00:34:52,740 --> 00:34:53,740
Yep.

833
00:34:53,740 --> 00:34:56,340
And my dad called me when that story broke and he was like, "Hey, yeah, just wanted to

834
00:34:56,340 --> 00:34:57,340
let you know."

835
00:34:57,340 --> 00:34:58,340
And it was like he was breaking news to me.

836
00:34:58,340 --> 00:35:03,780
He was like, "I got the Johnson & Johnson vaccine."

837
00:35:03,780 --> 00:35:06,780
Like he was telling me that he was going to die.

838
00:35:06,780 --> 00:35:07,780
Yeah, yeah.

839
00:35:07,780 --> 00:35:10,280
I think he's so sure he's like, yeah.

840
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:12,280
And so, you know, whatever happens happens.

841
00:35:12,280 --> 00:35:15,080
But I just wanted you to know

842
00:35:15,080 --> 00:35:16,820
that's that's what I got to do.

843
00:35:16,820 --> 00:35:17,780
It was dope.

844
00:35:17,780 --> 00:35:20,920
I remember I got that and then it was like a week later that happened.

845
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:22,780
I was like, oh, sick.

846
00:35:22,780 --> 00:35:25,760
I don't even know which one I got.

847
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:28,220
Oh, wait, I do. None of them.

848
00:35:28,220 --> 00:35:30,760
They actually did get nice.

849
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:34,020
I didn't get a booster, but I did get the

850
00:35:34,020 --> 00:35:35,360
fuck a booster, dude.

851
00:35:35,360 --> 00:35:38,520
- I was like, bro, I was somewhere the other day

852
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:40,520
and they, I was somewhere, not the other day,

853
00:35:40,520 --> 00:35:42,480
I was somewhere four weeks ago.

854
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:44,000
I feel like it would have made more sense right now

855
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,240
'cause people are getting sick.

856
00:35:45,240 --> 00:35:47,160
I was somewhere a month ago,

857
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:49,200
actually the same venue I was at tonight,

858
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:52,560
and at the door, they checked vaccine cards.

859
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:54,980
- Oh my God. - And I could not believe it.

860
00:35:54,980 --> 00:35:57,900
I was like, what the fuck?

861
00:35:57,900 --> 00:36:02,560
What kind of communist China deal is this?

862
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:03,720
This is crazy.

863
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:05,600
It's literally over.

864
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:06,440
- Yeah.

865
00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:09,240
- They even, even the government declared it over.

866
00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:10,660
It's over, it's been over.

867
00:36:10,660 --> 00:36:12,600
- I don't know in my mind.

868
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:16,360
- I got reprimanded by a doctor, by a general physician.

869
00:36:16,360 --> 00:36:18,960
It was like, no, it was like,

870
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:20,760
I feel like four months ago now,

871
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:22,600
where I just had like the flu or something.

872
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:25,040
I was like just feeling sick.

873
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:28,080
And he was like, okay, do you have your COVID vaccines?

874
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:29,840
I was like, yeah, I got the two.

875
00:36:29,840 --> 00:36:32,840
He's like, well, you gotta get the boosters.

876
00:36:32,840 --> 00:36:33,940
You ought to get the booster.

877
00:36:33,940 --> 00:36:36,480
So I'm like, yeah, I'm going to do it like it's my dad.

878
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:37,000
Yeah.

879
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:37,600
Yeah.

880
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:41,560
Here's what I say, you ought to pick up a football, homo.

881
00:36:41,560 --> 00:36:45,560
We're going to replace you with a computer in three years, fucking asshole.

882
00:36:45,560 --> 00:36:50,920
Well, he completely cured me anyways, but he was really rude to me that time.

883
00:36:50,920 --> 00:36:52,480
That's the thing about doctors.

884
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:56,000
They, I hate those bastards because I think they're smarter than anybody, but

885
00:36:56,000 --> 00:37:00,720
then they do literal magic to you somehow and cure every single problem you have.

886
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:04,540
They just write something on a little piece of paper and I get some pills.

887
00:37:04,540 --> 00:37:09,200
And then I walk away and I'm like, whatever, but I won't even pay for it.

888
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:10,520
I'm not even going to pay.

889
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:10,960
I'm going to pay.

890
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:15,040
It's going to take me 10 years to pay this $100 medical copay.

891
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:20,920
I have a $100 medical copay that has been sitting in my mailbox,

892
00:37:20,920 --> 00:37:25,640
comes every single month and they say, you better pay this because guess what?

893
00:37:25,640 --> 00:37:27,840
We're adding 30 cents on top of it.

894
00:37:27,840 --> 00:37:29,760
Oh no.

895
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:31,880
So what's it at this point?

896
00:37:31,880 --> 00:37:34,040
I think it's at a dollar and seven,

897
00:37:34,040 --> 00:37:37,880
$107, something like that.

898
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:39,800
Oh, and it's been like a year.

899
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:40,440
It's racking up.

900
00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:41,560
It's racking up.

901
00:37:41,560 --> 00:37:42,560
I know.

902
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:44,200
And you know, that interest compounds.

903
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:45,280
Yeah.

904
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:46,440
Yeah.

905
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:49,000
What do you guys have good credit scores?

906
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,520
Um, I think I do.

907
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:54,320
Mine goes up and down.

908
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:57,560
I thought mine was really, really terrible, but it's, I mean, it's not,

909
00:37:57,560 --> 00:38:01,920
It's bad, but it's like 660 or something.

910
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:03,440
I thought it was like 400.

911
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:05,840
I don't know how to check mine down here,

912
00:38:05,840 --> 00:38:10,720
but when I went to get a car loan,

913
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:13,000
they were like, "Yeah, you have amazing credit."

914
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:19,840
I just didn't have enough capital to the first payment, I guess.

915
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:24,280
But on credit, I'm completely good because I stay on time on payments.

916
00:38:24,280 --> 00:38:26,120
I have good credit.

917
00:38:26,120 --> 00:38:28,120
What is it? What's the number?

918
00:38:28,120 --> 00:38:30,120
730.

919
00:38:30,120 --> 00:38:32,120
That's pretty good. Yeah.

920
00:38:32,120 --> 00:38:34,120
My problem is

921
00:38:34,120 --> 00:38:36,120
they won't give me

922
00:38:36,120 --> 00:38:38,120
a credit card that matches

923
00:38:38,120 --> 00:38:40,120
what I spend.

924
00:38:40,120 --> 00:38:42,120
Because you already have a

925
00:38:42,120 --> 00:38:44,120
fucked up make 'em up thing.

926
00:38:44,120 --> 00:38:46,120
Yeah. Yeah. Well also, and

927
00:38:46,120 --> 00:38:48,120
this is the thing, is like

928
00:38:48,120 --> 00:38:52,120
I have a child's bank account.

929
00:38:52,120 --> 00:38:54,120
Yeah. Yeah. I literally have like

930
00:38:54,120 --> 00:38:58,400
the one for when you're in college still. Your mom's name is on it. My dad's yeah.

931
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:06,660
Your dad's name, of course. Just go to another bank. Well, I know but so I've

932
00:39:06,660 --> 00:39:10,920
called them like I called them every six months I'm like hey can you like raise

933
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:16,920
my credit limit so I don't have to pay it twice a month. Sorry, sorry, sorry, I grew up I'm not a kid anymore.

934
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:23,920
They do a hard inquiry it lowers my credit score and then they go no. Wow.

935
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:29,500
Not the last I was in New York, but the time before I was sitting in the Airbnb with Julio

936
00:39:29,500 --> 00:39:33,080
because I had filled out my credit card in like three days and I was like, hey, can we

937
00:39:33,080 --> 00:39:36,200
like, yeah, this is a really low credit score.

938
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:37,960
$1500 limit or some shit.

939
00:39:37,960 --> 00:39:39,720
Yeah, something like that.

940
00:39:39,720 --> 00:39:44,680
And I called them and I was like, hey, can I get this raised?

941
00:39:44,680 --> 00:39:46,680
And they like, like, no.

942
00:39:46,680 --> 00:39:47,680
Wow.

943
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:52,920
No, you got to like, two guys.

944
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:57,320
on. You're supposed to only use 30% of your credit, right? That's like the thing.

945
00:39:57,320 --> 00:39:59,080
I guess. Who cares?

946
00:39:59,080 --> 00:40:03,400
We're trying to move and this guy who's going to be a potential landlord made us do like,

947
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:08,600
he's just making us send all this and we're running into the same problem where we sent him like the

948
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:12,520
Patreon and stuff and we're like, here's how much we make every month and he, on the phone right in

949
00:40:12,520 --> 00:40:16,760
front of me, he's like, well, how do I know that you didn't just create this website and then just

950
00:40:16,760 --> 00:40:19,200
just put some random number on it.

951
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:20,280
- That's crazy.

952
00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:24,220
- I was like, dude, why would I do that?

953
00:40:24,220 --> 00:40:27,880
It's not like I'm signing a lease,

954
00:40:27,880 --> 00:40:30,320
I have to pay the fucking rent every month.

955
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:33,080
- You know how those people, those people actually,

956
00:40:33,080 --> 00:40:36,560
it's funny, they don't trust anything on a browser,

957
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:38,240
but if you send them a PDF,

958
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:41,160
like one of those invoices that Patreon sends you

959
00:40:41,160 --> 00:40:44,000
that says nothing on it, but just like Patreon.com

960
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:45,320
and just have the number on it,

961
00:40:45,320 --> 00:40:46,480
they're like, oh yeah, for sure, man,

962
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:47,480
This is how much money you make.

963
00:40:47,480 --> 00:40:48,480
Yeah, because it's a file.

964
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:49,480
Yeah.

965
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:58,040
He was like, he made me send my unfiled 2022 corporate tax, which has no, it's just a filled

966
00:40:58,040 --> 00:40:59,040
PDF.

967
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:02,600
I could make it say that we make $10 million a year.

968
00:41:02,600 --> 00:41:03,600
And he was like, "Oh, okay, okay.

969
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:05,960
So I'm starting to see, get an idea of your finances."

970
00:41:05,960 --> 00:41:10,440
Like, bro, there's no difference.

971
00:41:10,440 --> 00:41:15,880
And also I sent him bank statements and he was like, "I've never heard of this bank."

972
00:41:15,880 --> 00:41:19,720
It's like, OK, you have a computer, man.

973
00:41:19,720 --> 00:41:23,320
Yeah. No, he's.

974
00:41:23,320 --> 00:41:26,080
He's old, though, so, you know, bastard.

975
00:41:26,080 --> 00:41:29,060
I mean, that's what happened to us out here is we had to pay our whole year

976
00:41:29,060 --> 00:41:31,560
of rent up front because they were just like, yeah, I don't trust

977
00:41:31,560 --> 00:41:33,500
what you're sending me. Yeah.

978
00:41:33,500 --> 00:41:36,600
You know, it's sad, dude.

979
00:41:36,600 --> 00:41:38,840
We need the creators to step in.

980
00:41:38,840 --> 00:41:43,780
Creators need to handle need to be landowners and we need to be landlords.

981
00:41:44,140 --> 00:41:44,960
We do need to be.

982
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:45,760
That's why I am.

983
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:47,840
I will bravely

984
00:41:47,840 --> 00:41:50,140
the next three years become a landlord.

985
00:41:50,140 --> 00:41:51,560
I would love because I'm understand.

986
00:41:51,560 --> 00:41:52,600
I would be a good landlord

987
00:41:52,600 --> 00:41:53,480
because I'm under because

988
00:41:53,480 --> 00:41:55,440
if somebody comes to me and they say, hey,

989
00:41:55,440 --> 00:41:59,360
I have a I have a very popular

990
00:41:59,360 --> 00:42:01,740
rumble dot com account.

991
00:42:01,740 --> 00:42:02,900
I'll go, fuck it, man.

992
00:42:02,900 --> 00:42:03,620
Live here for free.

993
00:42:03,620 --> 00:42:05,700
I don't give a fucking shit.

994
00:42:05,700 --> 00:42:07,200
Yeah, as long as you're downstairs

995
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:09,860
screaming into a sure microphone

996
00:42:09,860 --> 00:42:11,880
with a ring light right on you.

997
00:42:11,880 --> 00:42:12,620
I don't care.

998
00:42:12,620 --> 00:42:14,060
Do whatever you want.

999
00:42:14,060 --> 00:42:15,320
Don't even pay the rent.

1000
00:42:15,320 --> 00:42:17,760
I support you.

1001
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:22,900
So I would love to speed run zero,

1002
00:42:22,900 --> 00:42:27,800
so any percent getting on the hundred worst landlords in New York list.

1003
00:42:27,800 --> 00:42:30,400
Yes. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1004
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:32,480
There's not enough Jewish names on them.

1005
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:33,880
I think it's pretty easy.

1006
00:42:33,880 --> 00:42:38,820
I think it's literally like people are so just babies about it.

1007
00:42:38,820 --> 00:42:40,720
Dude, I have a terrible landlord.

1008
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:42,560
I have an awful, awful landlord.

1009
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:45,920
I would never go on a online and complain about it

1010
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:50,920
or start a GoFundMe for paying off the like,

1011
00:42:50,920 --> 00:42:53,440
oh, they're not giving me my security deposit.

1012
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:54,600
Who cares, bro?

1013
00:42:54,600 --> 00:42:57,240
I mean, I'm also a terrible tenant.

1014
00:42:57,240 --> 00:42:58,680
Everybody's a terrible tenant.

1015
00:42:58,680 --> 00:43:01,320
You are, everyone is an awful tenant.

1016
00:43:01,320 --> 00:43:02,160
Yeah.

1017
00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:03,280
I'm putting oil down my drain.

1018
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:04,120
I'm taking my pan--

1019
00:43:04,120 --> 00:43:04,960
Dude, I do it every day.

1020
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:07,600
Directly from the stove and dumping

1021
00:43:07,600 --> 00:43:08,760
that shit down the drain. I literally saw

1022
00:43:08,760 --> 00:43:10,280
something today-- It's still hot.

1023
00:43:10,280 --> 00:43:15,400
I saw something today that was like, "Oh, a landlord's raising the rent," and then

1024
00:43:15,400 --> 00:43:18,080
a picture of them putting oil in the sink.

1025
00:43:18,080 --> 00:43:20,080
And I was like, "Oh, yeah, I forgot you're not supposed to do that."

1026
00:43:20,080 --> 00:43:21,080
I do that every single day.

1027
00:43:21,080 --> 00:43:23,800
Yeah, I do that all the time.

1028
00:43:23,800 --> 00:43:28,760
God bless my poor landlord Joanne who has to, when I leave here, she thinks I've been

1029
00:43:28,760 --> 00:43:29,760
a good tenant.

1030
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:31,860
She thinks I've been a pretty good tenant.

1031
00:43:31,860 --> 00:43:35,880
When I leave here, she is going to raise hell.

1032
00:43:35,880 --> 00:43:37,680
She will try to find me.

1033
00:43:37,680 --> 00:43:41,760
going to be hiring private investigators to come and slash my tires.

1034
00:43:41,760 --> 00:43:43,480
No, you know what's going to happen?

1035
00:43:43,480 --> 00:43:46,520
She you're going to leave and she's going to just rent to someone else

1036
00:43:46,520 --> 00:43:48,640
and then they're going to have to deal with the consequences

1037
00:43:48,640 --> 00:43:49,480
because she didn't do any.

1038
00:43:49,480 --> 00:43:51,280
You're right. It's true. You're right.

1039
00:43:51,280 --> 00:43:53,520
That's the real landlord.

1040
00:43:53,520 --> 00:43:56,360
Well, that just makes me happy then, because I've never met those people

1041
00:43:56,360 --> 00:43:58,520
and I've met her a couple of times.

1042
00:43:58,520 --> 00:44:00,520
So I can just pretend that they're going to be

1043
00:44:00,520 --> 00:44:03,700
some really evil people coming in here.

1044
00:44:03,700 --> 00:44:05,040
But I think they might be.

1045
00:44:05,040 --> 00:44:06,360
It's definitely possible.

1046
00:44:06,360 --> 00:44:08,820
Yeah, yeah, probably evil apartment.

1047
00:44:08,820 --> 00:44:12,560
Yeah, well, there's also like like I'm excited to move.

1048
00:44:12,560 --> 00:44:15,960
Yeah, dude, you're just going to

1049
00:44:15,960 --> 00:44:18,060
my apartment is too small. It's too small.

1050
00:44:18,060 --> 00:44:21,560
Yeah. Are you getting a second bedroom area?

1051
00:44:21,560 --> 00:44:23,900
I hope so. Our lease is up in

1052
00:44:23,900 --> 00:44:28,320
July, so I got to start looking for shit soon.

1053
00:44:28,320 --> 00:44:33,200
But everything around here is getting so expensive that I just got to.

1054
00:44:34,220 --> 00:44:35,380
We just got to jump on something.

1055
00:44:35,380 --> 00:44:36,480
But I want to stay in the area.

1056
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:38,220
I don't want to have to move to fucking...

1057
00:44:38,220 --> 00:44:39,220
Although I do kind of...

1058
00:44:39,220 --> 00:44:40,860
Why don't you just move into a big house?

1059
00:44:40,860 --> 00:44:42,620
That would be paradise.

1060
00:44:42,620 --> 00:44:43,220
That'd be so...

1061
00:44:43,220 --> 00:44:46,720
I know somebody who lives in a brownstone with...

1062
00:44:46,720 --> 00:44:49,620
It's him and his wife and then two other couples,

1063
00:44:49,620 --> 00:44:51,820
and they each get like a floor of the brownstone.

1064
00:44:51,820 --> 00:44:53,220
I was like, "Oh, that's so cool."

1065
00:44:53,220 --> 00:44:54,920
I was like, "How much do you pay for rent?"

1066
00:44:54,920 --> 00:45:00,720
And he said, "Well, the entire building is about $11,000 a month."

1067
00:45:00,720 --> 00:45:02,620
I was like, "Oh my God."

1068
00:45:02,620 --> 00:45:04,620
What the fuck?

1069
00:45:04,620 --> 00:45:05,620
Yeah.

1070
00:45:05,620 --> 00:45:06,620
Oh my God.

1071
00:45:06,620 --> 00:45:07,620
Is that crazy?

1072
00:45:07,620 --> 00:45:11,620
$11,000 a month for a fucking building?

1073
00:45:11,620 --> 00:45:14,620
I mean, it is like, you know, basically six bedrooms over.

1074
00:45:14,620 --> 00:45:17,620
It's a giant house.

1075
00:45:17,620 --> 00:45:20,620
But yeah, it kind of blew my mind that he's like a working professional

1076
00:45:20,620 --> 00:45:25,620
who lives in like a TikTok hype house type rental situation.

1077
00:45:25,620 --> 00:45:28,620
Well, I don't think they do TikToks in there.

1078
00:45:28,620 --> 00:45:29,620
I think they just do their normal life.

1079
00:45:29,620 --> 00:45:31,620
I don't fucking know what they do.

1080
00:45:31,620 --> 00:45:36,380
Okay. But yeah, I don't think I could do, I think once I've got,

1081
00:45:36,380 --> 00:45:39,100
now that I've gone, no roommates, I don't think I never do them again.

1082
00:45:39,100 --> 00:45:42,220
It's just too crazy.

1083
00:45:42,220 --> 00:45:45,780
I love having roommates. I like the chaos.

1084
00:45:45,780 --> 00:45:50,980
I hate roommates. It, uh, it reminds me, well,

1085
00:45:50,980 --> 00:45:52,780
you're a single child. That's why you like roommates.

1086
00:45:52,780 --> 00:45:58,260
Yeah. Might have something to do with it. You just got analyzed full.

1087
00:45:59,940 --> 00:46:02,180
- Yeah, put your front back in your pants, all right?

1088
00:46:02,180 --> 00:46:03,500
- Yeah, okay.

1089
00:46:03,500 --> 00:46:06,820
Roommates are brothers and sisters.

1090
00:46:06,820 --> 00:46:08,220
- Let's clap for that. - Okay.

1091
00:46:08,220 --> 00:46:11,380
- That is an amazing point that I just made.

1092
00:46:11,380 --> 00:46:13,060
- I mean, I'm clapping, but I don't really,

1093
00:46:13,060 --> 00:46:14,260
I can't really understand.

1094
00:46:14,260 --> 00:46:15,940
- Roommate, wait, I'm standing up.

1095
00:46:15,940 --> 00:46:18,540
Roommates are brothers and sisters, okay?

1096
00:46:18,540 --> 00:46:20,860
'Cause what do brothers and sisters do?

1097
00:46:20,860 --> 00:46:23,220
- They just fuck everything up. - They lift you?

1098
00:46:23,220 --> 00:46:26,340
- They, here's what brothers and sisters do.

1099
00:46:26,340 --> 00:46:27,860
They're in the room over and they're fucking

1100
00:46:27,860 --> 00:46:31,860
the shit out of each other as loud as they possibly can

1101
00:46:31,860 --> 00:46:34,100
to interrupt you rewatching The Office.

1102
00:46:34,100 --> 00:46:34,940
Okay?

1103
00:46:34,940 --> 00:46:37,540
That's what brothers and sisters do.

1104
00:46:37,540 --> 00:46:40,140
So that's exactly how roommates are brothers and sisters.

1105
00:46:40,140 --> 00:46:42,500
And I have no interest in ever having brothers and sisters

1106
00:46:42,500 --> 00:46:43,640
again for as long as I live.

1107
00:46:43,640 --> 00:46:44,940
I left my brothers at home.

1108
00:46:44,940 --> 00:46:47,000
I don't want to ever see them again.

1109
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:47,940
- Yeah.

1110
00:46:47,940 --> 00:46:50,460
- I think it's different when you have space

1111
00:46:50,460 --> 00:46:51,380
between the rooms.

1112
00:46:51,380 --> 00:46:52,740
'Cause I know what you mean.

1113
00:46:52,740 --> 00:46:54,620
Being loud as fuck.

1114
00:46:54,620 --> 00:46:56,100
- You live in a hallway.

1115
00:46:56,100 --> 00:46:57,460
- I do live in a hallway.

1116
00:46:57,460 --> 00:47:00,460
You should be, of all people, to complain about roommates,

1117
00:47:00,460 --> 00:47:03,620
it should be you, because we can't go one single episode

1118
00:47:03,620 --> 00:47:05,860
without one of them sasquatching behind you.

1119
00:47:05,860 --> 00:47:07,660
(laughs)

1120
00:47:07,660 --> 00:47:09,820
- It's the same one, you know.

1121
00:47:09,820 --> 00:47:11,620
- Yeah, he just likes walking.

1122
00:47:11,620 --> 00:47:13,060
(laughs)

1123
00:47:13,060 --> 00:47:15,260
He always has something to, he literally,

1124
00:47:15,260 --> 00:47:18,140
during the day, when he knows that you're gonna record,

1125
00:47:18,140 --> 00:47:20,620
he sees you plug in your microphone in the morning,

1126
00:47:20,620 --> 00:47:24,060
and then he starts setting up stuff in either side of,

1127
00:47:24,060 --> 00:47:26,120
either room on either end of you,

1128
00:47:26,120 --> 00:47:27,200
so that he can go and be like,

1129
00:47:27,200 --> 00:47:29,440
oh, sorry, I have to get my water bottle.

1130
00:47:29,440 --> 00:47:31,560
'Cause he loves it so much, he loves the attention.

1131
00:47:31,560 --> 00:47:34,080
- He does love the attention. - Yeah, he does.

1132
00:47:34,080 --> 00:47:34,920
- But do you know what I mean?

1133
00:47:34,920 --> 00:47:37,320
I just feel like roommates are,

1134
00:47:37,320 --> 00:47:41,480
they're just, it's just so nice being alone.

1135
00:47:41,480 --> 00:47:43,640
And you're never alone with roommates.

1136
00:47:43,640 --> 00:47:44,480
- That is true.

1137
00:47:44,480 --> 00:47:48,360
I will say, it does suck to never just like,

1138
00:47:48,360 --> 00:47:50,000
sit in your underwear.

1139
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:55,120
- Or sit, dude, I'm, but today I was sitting on my couch

1140
00:47:55,120 --> 00:47:57,200
and I had my dick out.

1141
00:47:57,200 --> 00:47:58,760
And I'm not gonna lie, it was morning

1142
00:47:58,760 --> 00:48:02,140
and I had about a half of a chubby morning wood type thing.

1143
00:48:02,140 --> 00:48:06,440
I was doing the crossword on my couch,

1144
00:48:06,440 --> 00:48:09,000
dicking balls out, and I was scratching him, dude.

1145
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:10,600
And I was getting under him, too.

1146
00:48:10,600 --> 00:48:12,440
I was getting really dangerously close

1147
00:48:12,440 --> 00:48:14,040
to my morning asshole.

1148
00:48:14,040 --> 00:48:16,360
And then I look through my window

1149
00:48:16,360 --> 00:48:20,680
and I see a big fat guy, also naked,

1150
00:48:20,680 --> 00:48:23,080
looking in his fridge who just looks right at me.

1151
00:48:23,960 --> 00:48:25,200
And I didn't even feel embarrassed.

1152
00:48:25,200 --> 00:48:27,360
I was like, I was like, you know what?

1153
00:48:27,360 --> 00:48:29,800
I mean, I've seen this guy naked plenty of times.

1154
00:48:29,800 --> 00:48:33,760
I was like, I don't think I've ever been naked in front of him.

1155
00:48:33,760 --> 00:48:38,000
But so this is what's great about not having roommates.

1156
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:40,400
I can see that. I'll never see that fucking guy.

1157
00:48:40,400 --> 00:48:43,920
The only time I'll ever if I saw him on the street, I wouldn't recognize him

1158
00:48:43,920 --> 00:48:47,020
because I would never if he walked around with a window in front of him, I might.

1159
00:48:47,020 --> 00:48:49,860
But if he's just walking down the street, I'm not going to know who it is.

1160
00:48:49,860 --> 00:48:53,260
If a roommate sees my dick and balls, I'm moving.

1161
00:48:53,600 --> 00:48:56,600
I don't I can't do that because they're going to fall in love with me.

1162
00:48:56,600 --> 00:48:59,140
It's too scary.

1163
00:48:59,140 --> 00:49:00,900
They're going to try and take your pills.

1164
00:49:00,900 --> 00:49:01,940
Exactly.

1165
00:49:01,940 --> 00:49:04,140
And they had roommates.

1166
00:49:04,140 --> 00:49:04,700
I don't know.

1167
00:49:04,700 --> 00:49:05,780
I do.

1168
00:49:05,780 --> 00:49:08,580
I do the move where I slip my hand down

1169
00:49:08,580 --> 00:49:11,720
under the elastic and scratch my balls

1170
00:49:11,720 --> 00:49:15,620
and then kind of leave it there after your card.

1171
00:49:15,620 --> 00:49:17,120
Yeah.

1172
00:49:17,120 --> 00:49:20,120
So just like you get caught, just like you're like, oh.

1173
00:49:22,120 --> 00:49:24,960
Wait, you put your ball sack hand on the back of your neck?

1174
00:49:24,960 --> 00:49:27,220
Well, just pull it away and then like,

1175
00:49:27,220 --> 00:49:29,800
scratch my head like I wasn't doing anything.

1176
00:49:29,800 --> 00:49:30,800
Yeah.

1177
00:49:30,800 --> 00:49:32,960
Do you want to know your use?

1178
00:49:32,960 --> 00:49:35,600
Grab some candy with the same hand and just eat.

1179
00:49:35,600 --> 00:49:39,140
Hey, why do the Twizzlers smell like a shoe?

1180
00:49:39,140 --> 00:49:42,640
My balls smell completely normal.

1181
00:49:42,640 --> 00:49:45,640
Balls do not smell normal in any way.

1182
00:49:45,640 --> 00:49:47,580
Balls are the part of your body.

1183
00:49:47,580 --> 00:49:50,580
Your balls have been grafted on by aliens.

1184
00:49:50,580 --> 00:49:53,920
They're not part of a human anatomy.

1185
00:49:53,920 --> 00:49:54,880
I think they're not real.

1186
00:49:54,880 --> 00:49:56,560
I think balls are really, really bad.

1187
00:49:56,560 --> 00:50:00,320
Sometimes my ball, I will shower and get out of the shower

1188
00:50:00,320 --> 00:50:02,000
and I smell my balls.

1189
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:02,840
I'm like, I wash them with chemicals.

1190
00:50:02,840 --> 00:50:04,400
- Do you wash your dick?

1191
00:50:04,400 --> 00:50:05,240
- Wait.

1192
00:50:05,240 --> 00:50:07,600
- Oh, dude, yes I wash my dick.

1193
00:50:07,600 --> 00:50:08,780
- What?

1194
00:50:08,780 --> 00:50:12,720
- Yeah, balls just smell basically like shit all the time.

1195
00:50:12,720 --> 00:50:14,680
- Not all, not all.

1196
00:50:14,680 --> 00:50:16,000
- That's what you're talking about.

1197
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:17,280
- You smell weird.

1198
00:50:17,280 --> 00:50:18,120
You got something in you.

1199
00:50:18,120 --> 00:50:19,480
You got the stink in you.

1200
00:50:19,480 --> 00:50:21,520
No, no, no. Like you wash your balls for like.

1201
00:50:21,520 --> 00:50:24,960
Basically, it's got to be a diet, and then you get out of the

1202
00:50:24,960 --> 00:50:27,200
and then you get out of the shower, almost to the fridge,

1203
00:50:27,200 --> 00:50:32,360
you get out of the fridge and you your balls just smell like actual human shit

1204
00:50:32,360 --> 00:50:35,440
and they stink up every room you walk into.

1205
00:50:35,440 --> 00:50:37,720
OK, you don't have this experience.

1206
00:50:37,720 --> 00:50:39,280
No, I know.

1207
00:50:39,280 --> 00:50:42,360
I well, I don't shower myself, so true.

1208
00:50:42,360 --> 00:50:46,240
I can't really relate.

1209
00:50:46,240 --> 00:50:48,840
Speaking of shit that smells bad,

1210
00:50:48,840 --> 00:50:52,800
I went to the dentist for the first time in like five years.

1211
00:50:52,800 --> 00:50:54,600
Okay. Did you have an abscess?

1212
00:50:54,600 --> 00:50:56,700
No, it was fucked up.

1213
00:50:56,700 --> 00:50:58,000
They said I was fine.

1214
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:02,080
Oh no. Dentistry is such a scam.

1215
00:51:02,080 --> 00:51:03,480
It's such a scam.

1216
00:51:03,480 --> 00:51:06,480
Fake doctor, fake doctor.

1217
00:51:06,480 --> 00:51:08,200
But you know why it's a fake doctor?

1218
00:51:08,200 --> 00:51:11,280
I haven't brushed my teeth twice a day in five years.

1219
00:51:11,280 --> 00:51:13,200
Yeah. I brush my teeth.

1220
00:51:13,200 --> 00:51:14,400
You know when I brush my teeth?

1221
00:51:14,400 --> 00:51:16,000
When someone complains.

1222
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:17,640
That's when I brush my teeth.

1223
00:51:17,640 --> 00:51:22,140
If my wife says, "You smell like shit," I go,

1224
00:51:22,140 --> 00:51:23,960
"Time to brush my teeth."

1225
00:51:23,960 --> 00:51:24,800
- Yep.

1226
00:51:24,800 --> 00:51:29,800
And I guarantee you, your teeth are not only white-ish,

1227
00:51:29,800 --> 00:51:33,040
but you probably have no cavities.

1228
00:51:33,040 --> 00:51:34,040
- I don't have a single cavity.

1229
00:51:34,040 --> 00:51:35,100
I've never had one.

1230
00:51:35,100 --> 00:51:35,940
- Yeah.

1231
00:51:35,940 --> 00:51:37,060
- I have strong teeth.

1232
00:51:37,060 --> 00:51:38,320
Peasant's teeth, they call it.

1233
00:51:38,320 --> 00:51:39,900
- It's a power of will.

1234
00:51:39,900 --> 00:51:41,040
- Yeah.

1235
00:51:41,040 --> 00:51:45,760
And also, as I established earlier, I do not eat candy.

1236
00:51:45,760 --> 00:51:46,600
- I eat fucking candy.

1237
00:51:46,600 --> 00:51:51,500
huge. I've every single day I've had at least one monster or

1238
00:51:51,500 --> 00:51:55,200
something similar. Yeah, there have been days where I've drank.

1239
00:51:55,200 --> 00:52:01,500
I've probably in between teeth brushings had 13 cans of drink.

1240
00:52:01,500 --> 00:52:07,400
Yeah, it's crazy.

1241
00:52:07,400 --> 00:52:10,000
My drink coffee.

1242
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:10,900
I've had beer.

1243
00:52:10,900 --> 00:52:11,700
I've had monster.

1244
00:52:11,700 --> 00:52:13,500
I've had diet Coke.

1245
00:52:13,500 --> 00:52:17,380
So this is going to come down to two things.

1246
00:52:17,380 --> 00:52:18,220
Which one?

1247
00:52:18,220 --> 00:52:20,540
I think you do have, like, genetically,

1248
00:52:20,540 --> 00:52:22,180
there's great teeth maybe.

1249
00:52:22,180 --> 00:52:23,660
But also you should probably consider

1250
00:52:23,660 --> 00:52:26,020
also getting like a second opinion.

1251
00:52:26,020 --> 00:52:26,860
Because that--

1252
00:52:26,860 --> 00:52:27,680
- It's a bad tentative.

1253
00:52:27,680 --> 00:52:29,940
(laughing)

1254
00:52:29,940 --> 00:52:33,700
- Probably that dentist just doesn't want to do the job

1255
00:52:33,700 --> 00:52:35,020
that's your disgusting mouth.

1256
00:52:35,020 --> 00:52:38,780
- No, they were literally trying to do more to me

1257
00:52:38,780 --> 00:52:41,340
and they couldn't get it cleared by the insurance.

1258
00:52:41,340 --> 00:52:42,780
- It was pissing them off that you had said that.

1259
00:52:42,780 --> 00:52:47,100
It literally was. They came by like four different dentists came by while I was

1260
00:52:47,100 --> 00:52:50,380
sitting in the chair and were like, "Hey, open up for a second." They like poked

1261
00:52:50,380 --> 00:52:54,180
around in my mouth and like took pictures and they were like, "Nope." Because they

1262
00:52:54,180 --> 00:52:56,180
were like, "We should give you a deep clean."

1263
00:52:56,180 --> 00:53:02,180
Do you go to like a school? Like a dentist building? What kind of situation is this?

1264
00:53:02,180 --> 00:53:06,180
So you just go to an office with like the one dentist?

1265
00:53:06,180 --> 00:53:10,180
I think dentists usually, it's like lawyers, it's usually like two dentists.

1266
00:53:10,180 --> 00:53:24,380
yeah there's there's like two dentists and four of their whatever yeah and the

1267
00:53:24,380 --> 00:53:28,100
other thing I forgot is that uh when they take pictures I gag I have a really

1268
00:53:28,100 --> 00:53:33,340
bad gag reflex and a whole ton of pictures taking x-rays you know well

1269
00:53:33,340 --> 00:53:36,260
though when they put the thing in your mouth it's in your the flesh gets in

1270
00:53:36,260 --> 00:53:43,260
your mouth and the light makes you gag. Oh, the little thing they put on your tongue. Yeah. Okay, you gag at the photos of you that they show you.

1271
00:53:43,260 --> 00:53:58,460
Oh my god, get that away. I was just thinking about how bad I would be at sucking dick, which thankfully I don't have to do. I think I'd be pretty good at it.

1272
00:53:58,460 --> 00:54:05,260
You do? Sometimes I think that, but you know, then I, they try to take pictures of

1273
00:54:05,260 --> 00:54:06,820
my mouth and I was gagging.

1274
00:54:06,820 --> 00:54:11,340
I would be like full, like opening up my mouth.

1275
00:54:11,340 --> 00:54:13,020
I'd be like gagging and stuff.

1276
00:54:13,020 --> 00:54:13,860
- If it was--

1277
00:54:13,860 --> 00:54:15,060
- Noah's dick looks like a pancake

1278
00:54:15,060 --> 00:54:15,900
that you gotta open your mouth up.

1279
00:54:15,900 --> 00:54:18,380
- Yeah, if it was like a small,

1280
00:54:18,380 --> 00:54:20,220
just a little piece of candy and it was sweet,

1281
00:54:20,220 --> 00:54:22,020
I think Rex would be really good at it.

1282
00:54:22,020 --> 00:54:23,420
(laughing)

1283
00:54:23,420 --> 00:54:26,060
- Yeah, if sucking dick was eating a piece of candy,

1284
00:54:26,060 --> 00:54:29,700
I would probably have a lot of prior experience.

1285
00:54:29,700 --> 00:54:31,180
- I guess, what do I have in here

1286
00:54:31,180 --> 00:54:33,140
that I could demonstrate on?

1287
00:54:33,140 --> 00:54:33,980
Do I have a cucumber?

1288
00:54:33,980 --> 00:54:37,700
- Hold on. - You didn't even talk about

1289
00:54:37,700 --> 00:54:38,540
what you was missing for a week.

1290
00:54:38,540 --> 00:54:41,500
- I feel like I'm really good at eating a lollipop.

1291
00:54:41,500 --> 00:54:43,300
- Wait, what does that mean?

1292
00:54:43,300 --> 00:54:46,460
- Like I'm so good at just like not biting it

1293
00:54:46,460 --> 00:54:47,300
and not rubbing it on my tongue.

1294
00:54:47,300 --> 00:54:49,340
- You know, I was about to pick up a carrot

1295
00:54:49,340 --> 00:54:51,140
and put it backwards into my mouth

1296
00:54:51,140 --> 00:54:54,340
because it's a thick part and show myself choking,

1297
00:54:54,340 --> 00:54:55,700
but I thought of two things.

1298
00:54:55,700 --> 00:54:58,220
Number one, what if the carrot breaks off

1299
00:54:58,220 --> 00:55:01,380
and I just die on camera sucking on a carrot

1300
00:55:01,380 --> 00:55:02,980
because I choked on it?

1301
00:55:02,980 --> 00:55:04,700
- You're not gonna swallow it.

1302
00:55:04,700 --> 00:55:06,380
- Well, but yes I was.

1303
00:55:06,380 --> 00:55:08,220
That was basically the entire point that I was making

1304
00:55:08,220 --> 00:55:10,100
was that I was so good at sucking dick.

1305
00:55:10,100 --> 00:55:12,300
- Okay, so bring up the carrot.

1306
00:55:12,300 --> 00:55:14,520
- No, also I realized that I just got married

1307
00:55:14,520 --> 00:55:16,420
and I just shouldn't be doing kind of stuff like that.

1308
00:55:16,420 --> 00:55:18,900
- Oh, congrats, a married man.

1309
00:55:18,900 --> 00:55:19,900
- Congratulations.

1310
00:55:19,900 --> 00:55:21,580
- Congratulations.

1311
00:55:21,580 --> 00:55:23,620
- I was a big wedding, a big huge wedding.

1312
00:55:23,620 --> 00:55:26,100
- It's time to honor my wife by not sucking carrot.

1313
00:55:26,100 --> 00:55:28,820
- That honestly is probably the most husbandly thing

1314
00:55:28,820 --> 00:55:32,460
I've done ever is stop myself from sucking off a carrot

1315
00:55:32,460 --> 00:55:33,760
on camera.

1316
00:55:33,760 --> 00:55:37,260
It's pretty wise of me.

1317
00:55:37,260 --> 00:55:38,960
Yeah, you're a good man.

1318
00:55:38,960 --> 00:55:39,560
Caleb Piltz.

1319
00:55:39,560 --> 00:55:40,460
I'm a very good man.

1320
00:55:40,460 --> 00:55:42,060
How was the wedding?

1321
00:55:42,060 --> 00:55:43,860
How was the big event?

1322
00:55:43,860 --> 00:55:44,360
Nice.

1323
00:55:44,360 --> 00:55:49,360
Went to the courthouse, got hitched.

1324
00:55:49,360 --> 00:55:55,160
Yeah, so you saw the 45 out there?

1325
00:55:55,160 --> 00:56:00,560
Oh, so that was when we went and got our license, 45 was

1326
00:56:00,560 --> 00:56:01,760
getting arrested.

1327
00:56:02,160 --> 00:56:05,200
But this time there was just a whole lot of fucking fatties

1328
00:56:05,200 --> 00:56:07,320
getting married that we were sitting behind.

1329
00:56:07,320 --> 00:56:10,160
And it was a hot day too, so they were sticking together.

1330
00:56:10,160 --> 00:56:13,440
Yeah.

1331
00:56:13,440 --> 00:56:14,760
But it was a good time.

1332
00:56:14,760 --> 00:56:15,780
I wore a suit.

1333
00:56:15,780 --> 00:56:17,960
That's very sweet.

1334
00:56:17,960 --> 00:56:22,120
I wore a suit and I,

1335
00:56:22,120 --> 00:56:24,160
I don't know why I went full black suit.

1336
00:56:24,160 --> 00:56:25,640
Like I was at a funeral.

1337
00:56:25,640 --> 00:56:26,480
Yeah.

1338
00:56:26,480 --> 00:56:28,260
So all my photos I have a black tie on.

1339
00:56:28,260 --> 00:56:30,720
I just look like I'm at a funeral.

1340
00:56:30,720 --> 00:56:32,420
But, you know, I kind of went for the look.

1341
00:56:32,420 --> 00:56:34,620
I was thinking like, I'm going to look like a groom

1342
00:56:34,620 --> 00:56:37,120
that's on top of a wedding cake, you know, like that.

1343
00:56:37,120 --> 00:56:38,960
You look like John Wick.

1344
00:56:38,960 --> 00:56:42,260
I looked very John Wick, Lex Friedman style.

1345
00:56:42,260 --> 00:56:43,100
Yeah.

1346
00:56:43,100 --> 00:56:45,100
Just a kind of a crappy black suit.

1347
00:56:45,100 --> 00:56:47,500
I got it at Banana Republic the other day.

1348
00:56:47,500 --> 00:56:48,340
I think so.

1349
00:56:48,340 --> 00:56:50,500
I think I was wondering, now that I own a suit,

1350
00:56:50,500 --> 00:56:55,500
I've never, I guess I had like a suit from fucking Primark

1351
00:56:55,500 --> 00:56:58,160
that was like 50 bucks when I was in college.

1352
00:56:58,160 --> 00:56:59,000
Yeah.

1353
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:00,880
I own a suit that like fits me okay?

1354
00:57:00,880 --> 00:57:03,600
Should I just be a full suit comedian

1355
00:57:03,600 --> 00:57:04,920
and I wear a suit everywhere I go?

1356
00:57:04,920 --> 00:57:07,800
Anytime I do stand up I wear a full suit.

1357
00:57:07,800 --> 00:57:09,560
- You should be one of those people that are like,

1358
00:57:09,560 --> 00:57:11,560
I don't know why men dress like this.

1359
00:57:11,560 --> 00:57:14,200
What would the men should stop dressing like this?

1360
00:57:14,200 --> 00:57:16,000
- What happened to men?

1361
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:18,800
- Just walk around like that with some sneakers on.

1362
00:57:18,800 --> 00:57:22,000
- I'm wearing some suit that's like fucking six inches long

1363
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:24,680
on every single, what happened?

1364
00:57:24,680 --> 00:57:26,200
My sleeves are over my head,

1365
00:57:26,200 --> 00:57:28,160
like I'm a really shy girl in a hoodie.

1366
00:57:28,160 --> 00:57:29,700
What happened to men?

1367
00:57:29,700 --> 00:57:32,960
Men are just, what is wrong with men?

1368
00:57:32,960 --> 00:57:34,040
Men used to dress properly.

1369
00:57:34,040 --> 00:57:35,240
You're drenched in sweat.

1370
00:57:35,240 --> 00:57:35,740
Completely frayed.

1371
00:57:35,740 --> 00:57:36,240
Yeah.

1372
00:57:36,240 --> 00:57:36,740
Yeah.

1373
00:57:36,740 --> 00:57:37,600
It's a wool suit.

1374
00:57:37,600 --> 00:57:41,160
Completely frayed ends on the legs because I've been stepping on all the,

1375
00:57:41,160 --> 00:57:43,800
I've been stepping on the legs this entire time.

1376
00:57:43,800 --> 00:57:46,760
You keep, yeah, you keep stepping on a, on water as well.

1377
00:57:46,760 --> 00:57:49,720
So it's completely just wet and stinky.

1378
00:57:49,720 --> 00:57:50,280
Different color.

1379
00:57:50,280 --> 00:57:51,720
I'm wearing Vans.

1380
00:57:51,720 --> 00:57:52,440
Yeah.

1381
00:57:52,440 --> 00:57:53,440
What happened to men?

1382
00:57:53,440 --> 00:57:55,560
Men used to dress nicely.

1383
00:57:55,560 --> 00:57:57,320
Nobody wears a suit anymore.

1384
00:57:57,440 --> 00:57:59,700
- Wearing a suit is like the opposite

1385
00:57:59,700 --> 00:58:02,000
of what wearing a suit used to be.

1386
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:02,840
- Maybe I'll wear one tomorrow.

1387
00:58:02,840 --> 00:58:03,680
- It used to be only important guys wore suits.

1388
00:58:03,680 --> 00:58:05,360
- Actually, I just decided I'm going

1389
00:58:05,360 --> 00:58:06,560
to wear my suit tomorrow.

1390
00:58:06,560 --> 00:58:09,160
- To the show.

1391
00:58:09,160 --> 00:58:11,320
- We're recording tomorrow, I'm gonna wear my suit.

1392
00:58:11,320 --> 00:58:14,080
And this will come out after that, no, before that.

1393
00:58:14,080 --> 00:58:15,400
- Before that, yeah.

1394
00:58:15,400 --> 00:58:17,560
- I will wear my suit tomorrow.

1395
00:58:17,560 --> 00:58:19,200
That's at least the top part.

1396
00:58:19,200 --> 00:58:20,800
- Beers we drank, exclusive.

1397
00:58:20,800 --> 00:58:22,480
You should wear shorts.

1398
00:58:22,480 --> 00:58:23,320
- You should.

1399
00:58:23,320 --> 00:58:24,160
- And then stand up.

1400
00:58:24,160 --> 00:58:25,640
- I have black shorts. - Suit and shorts is dope.

1401
00:58:25,640 --> 00:58:28,480
that's a fits the top part of my suit.

1402
00:58:28,480 --> 00:58:29,500
It's actually not a bad idea.

1403
00:58:29,500 --> 00:58:30,320
This is the suit.

1404
00:58:30,320 --> 00:58:34,920
I went shopping for a wedding and, uh, you know, when you, when you go to those

1405
00:58:34,920 --> 00:58:37,440
stores, there's like a guy who like attends to you, right?

1406
00:58:37,440 --> 00:58:41,140
Cause you know, you don't know, no one knows anything about like nice clothes.

1407
00:58:41,140 --> 00:58:41,400
Right.

1408
00:58:41,400 --> 00:58:41,880
Yeah.

1409
00:58:41,880 --> 00:58:44,920
And the guy that was attending me was like a cool black guy.

1410
00:58:44,920 --> 00:58:49,560
And, uh, he's like, I think you would do really well in like a

1411
00:58:49,560 --> 00:58:51,800
salmon suit with like black shorts.

1412
00:58:51,800 --> 00:58:54,080
And I was like, I'm not you, man.

1413
00:58:54,160 --> 00:58:56,160
I can't do that.

1414
00:58:56,160 --> 00:59:01,660
I have the evil version of this story from when I bought a suit the other day.

1415
00:59:01,660 --> 00:59:05,660
I ended up buying my suit from Banana Republic and it was on sale.

1416
00:59:05,660 --> 00:59:09,740
But at first I went to Macy's because I knew they had cheaper suits and I went to the Ralph

1417
00:59:09,740 --> 00:59:14,300
Loren part of the thing and this guy started helping me.

1418
00:59:14,300 --> 00:59:18,300
His name was Marvin and he was just being such a bitch.

1419
00:59:18,300 --> 00:59:21,460
Like such a bitch dude.

1420
00:59:21,460 --> 00:59:23,340
I was like, he was like, "What size pants do you wear?"

1421
00:59:23,340 --> 00:59:26,580
I said 31, he said, "Really?"

1422
00:59:26,580 --> 00:59:27,860
- Small guy.

1423
00:59:27,860 --> 00:59:29,780
- And I was like, "Yeah, 31."

1424
00:59:29,780 --> 00:59:31,620
He said, "Lift up your shirt."

1425
00:59:31,620 --> 00:59:36,620
And I showed him my waist and he was like, "You're a 34."

1426
00:59:36,620 --> 00:59:39,300
(laughing)

1427
00:59:39,300 --> 00:59:41,540
- You fat fucking piece of shit.

1428
00:59:41,540 --> 00:59:42,380
- I hate this guy.

1429
00:59:42,380 --> 00:59:44,180
- What the fuck?

1430
00:59:44,180 --> 00:59:45,580
- Yeah, but then I was like,

1431
00:59:45,580 --> 00:59:50,580
he was saying like, "I think that you're gonna wear a 42R."

1432
00:59:50,580 --> 00:59:52,620
I was like, "Uh, the 40?"

1433
00:59:52,620 --> 00:59:55,340
Or no, he was like, I think you would need a 40R, sorry.

1434
00:59:55,340 --> 00:59:57,380
And I was like, the 42 I think looks more

1435
00:59:57,380 --> 00:59:59,060
like it would fit me better.

1436
00:59:59,060 --> 01:00:01,020
And he was like, okay.

1437
01:00:01,020 --> 01:00:02,940
And then I went into the dressing room

1438
01:00:02,940 --> 01:00:04,820
and he came in and I was like,

1439
01:00:04,820 --> 01:00:05,860
yeah, I think you're actually right.

1440
01:00:05,860 --> 01:00:08,260
I think the 40 is probably gonna fit me a little better.

1441
01:00:08,260 --> 01:00:10,460
He's like, hmm, okay.

1442
01:00:10,460 --> 01:00:11,740
So you didn't trust me

1443
01:00:11,740 --> 01:00:14,780
and now you just needed to find out for yourself.

1444
01:00:14,780 --> 01:00:15,620
- What the fuck?

1445
01:00:15,620 --> 01:00:17,580
- And I literally did this, I handed him the suit.

1446
01:00:17,580 --> 01:00:21,740
I said, Marvin, you are very, very unpleasant

1447
01:00:21,740 --> 01:00:25,300
and I have no interest in buying a suit from you.

1448
01:00:25,300 --> 01:00:26,420
And I left.

1449
01:00:26,420 --> 01:00:27,260
- Damn, that's powerful. - And I left.

1450
01:00:27,260 --> 01:00:29,100
- Filled him with kindness.

1451
01:00:29,100 --> 01:00:31,260
- I did not, I didn't wanna yell at him,

1452
01:00:31,260 --> 01:00:32,780
but also that's very not me.

1453
01:00:32,780 --> 01:00:36,380
I literally had like, my heart was racing

1454
01:00:36,380 --> 01:00:39,100
because I was just so mean to that guy.

1455
01:00:39,100 --> 01:00:42,260
But also, like dude, fucking kill yourself, bro.

1456
01:00:42,260 --> 01:00:43,660
You're not a gentleman.

1457
01:00:43,660 --> 01:00:47,580
You work at Macy's and you sell Ralph Lauren's

1458
01:00:47,580 --> 01:00:50,740
like overpriced suits that cost $14 to make.

1459
01:00:50,740 --> 01:00:53,940
You're not like a fucking like, oh, well, you trust me.

1460
01:00:53,940 --> 01:00:55,180
I'm a Sultan.

1461
01:00:55,180 --> 01:00:57,860
Like, dude, you're a fucking, you're a dickhead, right?

1462
01:00:57,860 --> 01:00:59,260
You used to work at GameStop.

1463
01:00:59,260 --> 01:01:01,060
And then one day you were like, I know how to tie a tie.

1464
01:01:01,060 --> 01:01:02,500
I'm gonna go work at Macy's.

1465
01:01:02,500 --> 01:01:05,340
- Yeah.

1466
01:01:05,340 --> 01:01:07,940
- Marvin's like, fucking kill yourself, Marvin.

1467
01:01:07,940 --> 01:01:08,780
You are a dickhead.

1468
01:01:08,780 --> 01:01:11,940
- Marvin, if you wanna come on the show next week,

1469
01:01:11,940 --> 01:01:14,860
you can come, say you just heard the story.

1470
01:01:14,860 --> 01:01:19,860
We can debate Caleb on whether or not he's fucking stupid.

1471
01:01:19,860 --> 01:01:22,500
I'm picking a suit.

1472
01:01:22,500 --> 01:01:26,300
- I hated Marvin, dude.

1473
01:01:26,300 --> 01:01:28,420
It just made me so mad.

1474
01:01:28,420 --> 01:01:33,420
But that's my upper limit of how rude I can be to somebody

1475
01:01:33,420 --> 01:01:37,540
who is working at their job, I think,

1476
01:01:37,540 --> 01:01:39,180
is just being like,

1477
01:01:39,180 --> 01:01:40,860
'cause usually I feel like I'm so accommodating.

1478
01:01:40,860 --> 01:01:45,620
I'm so good at, if somebody's a very rude waiter,

1479
01:01:45,620 --> 01:01:47,740
I actively am like, you know what?

1480
01:01:47,740 --> 01:01:49,460
It's a hard job. - Rude waiter is crazy.

1481
01:01:49,460 --> 01:01:52,020
- Rude waiter, you know what, I'm part of the problem.

1482
01:01:52,020 --> 01:01:54,460
If somebody's a rude waiter, I tip them more than I would

1483
01:01:54,460 --> 01:01:55,300
at just a nice person.

1484
01:01:55,300 --> 01:01:56,300
- Yes, yes.

1485
01:01:56,300 --> 01:01:58,560
- Because I'm like, you're gonna be rude to me?

1486
01:01:58,560 --> 01:02:00,980
Check out, check, 35%.

1487
01:02:00,980 --> 01:02:03,100
That's what I think about how rude you are.

1488
01:02:03,100 --> 01:02:03,940
I'm such an idiot. - Rude waiter is awesome.

1489
01:02:03,940 --> 01:02:04,860
- I fall for it.

1490
01:02:04,860 --> 01:02:07,660
So this guy thought that he was doing rude waiter to me.

1491
01:02:07,660 --> 01:02:09,180
- You don't tip your suit guy.

1492
01:02:09,180 --> 01:02:11,380
- He was just calling me fat and stupid.

1493
01:02:11,380 --> 01:02:14,940
All right, I have to go to bed.

1494
01:02:14,940 --> 01:02:17,500
I can't even think about Harvey anymore.

1495
01:02:17,500 --> 01:02:19,260
See you guys next week.

1496
01:02:19,260 --> 01:02:20,580
Bye.
