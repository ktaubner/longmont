1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:17,280
Welcome to minute one of podcast of the first minute of this show. We had to

2
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:20,320
catch up on all of our nice times that we spent together. We caught up and now

3
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:23,200
we're ready to do this shit. Okay so Pierce tell your story again about

4
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:27,600
watching a deer get shot in the head. No we recorded 30 of the most

5
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:32,400
six unreleasable minutes of podcasting. It was all about animal gore and it was

6
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:37,360
about chickens and being cut and killed. I had a full breakdown. And now I have

7
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:40,520
a song parody, guys, that I came up with in this last minute. Oh, my God, and I

8
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:43,320
need to do my song parody again. Wait, we still... We have to redo that song.

9
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:46,400
Yeah, we'll let Caleb go first. Okay. Okay, you guys know Frank Sinatra, It

10
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:47,600
Was A Very Good Year? Uh-huh.

11
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:50,620
When I was one,

12
00:00:50,620 --> 00:00:55,200
I was very, very young.

13
00:00:56,480 --> 00:01:04,680
I was very, very young and very hungry and I wore different clothes. I smelled

14
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:05,680
like the clothes

15
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:10,280
that my mom made me wear.

16
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:14,280
It was a very one year.

17
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:17,080
That's very first year.

18
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:20,980
In my second year.

19
00:01:20,980 --> 00:01:23,680
I learned my first word.

20
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:25,680
I learned to say dad.

21
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:30,360
bad. I learned to say dad and what foods tasted bad.

22
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:33,500
It was a very my second year

23
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:36,780
terrible to my very third

24
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:39,760
very

25
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:46,680
my very third year. It was the very third. I learn about different shapes,

26
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:53,840
so that's my parodies instead because that's I was a nice on the ray. I was

27
00:01:53,880 --> 00:02:01,320
my very first mistake. He's saying, "When I was seventeen, when I was twenty-five,

28
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:04,520
when I was thirty-five, now I'm forty-five." I'm saying, "What happened

29
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:07,520
to eleven?" Let's start from the beginning. When I was thirteen, I had my

30
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:11,700
first love. There we go. Thank you. Remember that song? No. Because my uncle

31
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:14,840
did, and I was good at drawing. Remember it was a Justin Bieber song? Oh,

32
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:17,160
yeah, yeah, yeah. Oh, yeah. I don't remember this song. That's Usher or

33
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:21,720
Ludacris. Ludacris. Yeah, yeah. When I was thirteen, I had my first love. Usher's

34
00:02:21,740 --> 00:02:25,140
one who signed just and be yes, the scooter brawn is the one that signed

35
00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:26,980
him. So here's my song, which may be

36
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:31,500
this one. This one will be a good lead into the third one, which is the best

37
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:34,780
one. There's this one. I thought mine was pretty good. Yours is really good.

38
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:35,020
This

39
00:02:35,020 --> 00:02:39,940
really good one and then maybe a kind of man one that everyone's already heard a

40
00:02:39,940 --> 00:02:44,460
couple times. Yeah, and then a good one and then the perfect one best one. So

41
00:02:44,460 --> 00:02:49,340
this is a song parody by somebody who thinks that the office character Jim is

42
00:02:49,380 --> 00:02:54,640
name Joe. Okay, it goes like this. Well, the weather outside is Dwight full, but

43
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:56,960
inside it's just so Michael

44
00:02:56,960 --> 00:03:03,000
and since there's no place to go, Pam and Joe, Pam and Joe, Pam and Joe, it's

45
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:07,080
great and then everybody is like no, it's a jam. It's Jim. Oh, that doesn't

46
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:07,400
run

47
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:12,660
and I knew that it just doesn't since there's no place to win

48
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:17,040
got since there's no one named Tim

49
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:19,680
and

50
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:23,640
the British one was named Tim

51
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:30,120
and Jim. There we go. It's good. Okay, now the third song, the third one hit

52
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:33,560
it. Why is everybody at the greatest pool? What is it? Everybody think the

53
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:37,360
Grinch is cool. Everybody's at the Grinch's pool. It's like

54
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:41,240
why does everybody think the Grinch is cool? Everybody skip school when the

55
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:45,240
the Grinch's pool went to Grinch's, went to Grinch's. That's very that's

56
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:49,240
a new lab. I think I just saw the Grinch at school. I just saw the

57
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:52,160
Grinch at school. Why did everybody think the how did that start? I just

58
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:55,080
saw the mother fucking granted school that didn't start for any good reason.

59
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:59,080
I started from one and then I think I just had too much. I kids do you like

60
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:03,120
Christmas? Yeah, I want to see me swim in a nine inch pool with a green guy

61
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:07,360
like I did. Was that before you don't see me do it like I did? Was that

62
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:07,840
before

63
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:09,620
I just drank a bit of egg nog

64
00:04:09,620 --> 00:04:13,080
dare me to play

65
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:16,160
dare me to fly

66
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:23,140
we were also doing that yeah the lady to fly the

67
00:04:23,140 --> 00:04:27,060
final red. I said nothing you idiots

68
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:31,920
he's locked in. What is the one we're doing the final rep battle of eight

69
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:34,200
mile? Oh yeah, he's doing he's going like

70
00:04:35,420 --> 00:04:38,220
know and he think the Grinch ain't cool, then how come I saw him at the

71
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:39,000
Grinch's pool

72
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:45,860
for Christmas? What's the area code for the North Pole? That's what I was

73
00:04:45,860 --> 00:04:49,700
trying to figure. I was trying to figure out who maybe for who yeah, but

74
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:54,280
it's hard to figure out the old health organization twelve to five everybody in

75
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:59,000
the twelve to five yeah. I don't know man yeah. I don't know either. What was

76
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,900
that? Some parodies are so difficult. I don't know how we are now. Does it

77
00:05:02,340 --> 00:05:05,580
before that we were doing pretty much the easiest thing you can do. We were

78
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:08,140
doing Peter, Peter Griffin,

79
00:05:08,140 --> 00:05:13,440
fucking Jennifer Coolidge or no, Jennifer Coolidge fucking Peter Griffin so hard

80
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:18,000
his butt falls off. I got a kick out of this. He loved that one. Just say,

81
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:22,540
"Oh, my butt fell off." It's pretty good, I think. It's not so funny anymore,

82
00:05:22,540 --> 00:05:25,780
but it was funny back in the day. When it happened, it was really funny,

83
00:05:25,780 --> 00:05:29,640
but that was what led into the Grinch's Cruel Song. I have a song parody

84
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:31,320
that has no lyrics, but it's it's

85
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:35,400
oh wait. I just remember another song parody. We were doing okay,

86
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:38,760
so this is okay. You do your first feel good ink meets crazy frog ready,

87
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:43,960
okay, don't don't don't don't don't don't don't don't don't don't don't

88
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:48,540
don't I don't get a bing bing now. That's just girl. You just did you just

89
00:05:48,540 --> 00:05:52,480
did girl talk. That's it. That was girl talk. That was here's another one that

90
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:53,200
I just thought of

91
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:58,080
that before this it's it's like it imagine like kind of like a two thousand

92
00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:01,520
on YouTube video style song parody, maybe Miranda Sings, Type 5.

93
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:05,560
And it's a bunch of guys and they're singing, "This is why I wear

94
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:10,440
douchebags." This is why I wear douchebags. This is why I wear douchebags.

95
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:16,920
We have no class. We have no class. We just have swag. This is why I

96
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:17,880
wear douchebags.

97
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:21,680
I could see that. We don't use mouth to make our pants tight. Isn't that

98
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:25,720
perfect? Couldn't that have been a video? Yeah, that could be like 2008,

99
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:28,520
like yeah, what was that that thing the station

100
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:37,000
is why we're do back. Yeah, that's why I would do I watch a forty minute video

101
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:41,860
about the downfall of freddie wong today. Yeah, the downfall fallen. He does. He

102
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:44,440
hasn't made a video in five years. That's because he's working on the

103
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:47,560
avengers movies. Probably working really game high school. Well, it's the

104
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:50,960
downfall as in he doesn't make youtube videos anymore. I'm sure that he's

105
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:55,480
probably never had to say downfall to get you to click that fact you wouldn't

106
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:57,380
click on a video that was like the

107
00:06:57,380 --> 00:07:01,560
continued success of beautiful Freddy.

108
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:06,960
He's not beautiful. I mean he is the plateaued success of Freddy Wong. I

109
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:10,800
don't say that don't say that a Freddy Freddy Wong is a beautiful Freddy Wong

110
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:14,520
looks like the most beautiful. What is he up to? How did he fall? That was the

111
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:17,760
first podcast I ever listened to was Freddy Wong's podcast. What was his

112
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:21,560
podcast? Face rocker man face rockers and he had a he had a

113
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:27,600
he had a he had a pickup artist on there. Which one mystery? No, his name was like

114
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:28,760
Fudd.

115
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:31,600
His name was like Brian. His name was like

116
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:36,520
a pickup artist named Fudd and he's dressed up like a hunter. His name was

117
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:36,760
like

118
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:39,120
he's walking up to a woman with a dead rabbit.

119
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:43,640
That's not working for me, man. That's not working at all? No. His name was

120
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:48,480
Brian Lion or something like that. Brian the Lion? It was just something lion and

121
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:51,600
he told some story. Maybe he was just lion. About how he would pick, I've

122
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:53,960
we talked about this before. Actually, he told some story about how you would

123
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:59,100
pick up girls at LARPing events. That's beast. Yeah, because they're hungry for

124
00:07:59,100 --> 00:08:03,160
dick. That's the only reason you go to a LARPing thing or a Renaissance fair is

125
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:08,880
to have sex and fuck. Yeah, both. Yeah. That's- it is crazy that how

126
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:13,080
every single person at a Ren fair is like the horniest person in the world.

127
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:17,160
I think that's why game, like the game theory is real, because sometimes game

128
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:21,840
is just an actual game. Sometimes games just play time. That's always who want

129
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:26,440
everyone who wants to play a game is interested in engaging with another

130
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:31,320
person in a sexual way. Yeah, jigsaw jigsaw is kind of sexually an old man

131
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:35,000
jigsaw is sexually active. Why do you think you watch is the trap? You know, I

132
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:39,000
just recently found out jigsaw is the good guy. Yeah, only in the new movie in

133
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:43,280
the new movie. Well, but he targets people who litter. He targets people who

134
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:47,820
who pretend to be sick and you are fat or who cut themselves. He says didn't one

135
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:50,720
boy, it's really funny. The first one he said yeah, the first one has one where

136
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:54,360
it's like there's a guy who is or it might be a woman who's like like you

137
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:58,780
cut you cut you slit your wrists, but I think you did it for attention. Now you

138
00:08:58,780 --> 00:09:01,200
have to prove that you really want to live like you have to in order to

139
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:04,120
survive. You have to crawl through this barbed wire or you can just stay here

140
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:07,680
and die and the person's like and like cross like it just showed the person.

141
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:12,000
It just why that is a person wanted. Why would you not just die man? It's not

142
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:15,820
his apprentice actually. I there any in the reverse bear trap. Are there any

143
00:09:15,820 --> 00:09:18,720
traps where there's just someone standing there like with a gun like

144
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:22,780
instead of it being like a pre rigged rub goldberg thing you dis this guy

145
00:09:22,780 --> 00:09:25,620
you'll shoot first one of like when they're both chained in the bathroom

146
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:28,740
that just one of the guys is like you have to kill the other guy. Oh yeah,

147
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:32,040
this off your like does do his apprentice her crimes that she's addicted

148
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:36,020
to drugs. She's a drug addict, but also but then so also here I'm sorry for the

149
00:09:36,020 --> 00:09:40,540
spoilers for everybody, but then it's revealed that also she she's addicted to

150
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:46,460
drugs, but then also her boyfriend was worked at a clinic where jigsaw's ex

151
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:51,340
wife worked and he was rushing quickly out of the clinic after wanting to get

152
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:55,980
drugs and he opened the door too fast and it slammed on yes, as ex wife's

153
00:09:55,980 --> 00:09:59,720
pregnant stomach and caused a miscarriage. I thought that was a baby

154
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:04,120
with a door, baby with a door. I thought that was a bad for that. I had as a

155
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:08,220
kid. I never thought that that was a jigsaw the movie thing. I thought that I

156
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:12,120
imagine that and then I looked it up later and I was like. Oh, does the first

157
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:15,720
one have the booby trap at the end where there's just like a shotgun sitting

158
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:20,480
above like a doorway? That's a two yeah to yeah that is that's the best trap at

159
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:24,200
all of them. That's also yeah he's a trap genius and he invents was just yeah

160
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:26,240
because the person is like well. Why don't we just leave

161
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:31,280
that one also is the best ending where it's like at the beginning they have

162
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:36,080
they kidnapped Donnie Walberg son and jigsaw like your son is safe and sound

163
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:39,280
and at the end it's revealed that the sun was in the same room as Donny

164
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:43,200
Wahlberg the whole time he was just inside a safe. Yeah, oh that's scary. I

165
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:47,560
told you exactly where he was. Have you guys have you guys ever seen safe room

166
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:52,160
or panic room? No, that's what it's called. It's about a lady. I think it's

167
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:57,380
Jody Foster and she has a house where she has a panic room in it and the most

168
00:10:57,380 --> 00:11:01,240
of the movie just takes place her and her her daughter in this room, and I

169
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:06,080
wanted one of these rooms so so badly yeah. That's a type of a bunker in your

170
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:09,620
my house sounds so fucking it's because of the only guy episode. I would the

171
00:11:09,620 --> 00:11:13,700
only reason I know about that I would use it as it would just be a man caved

172
00:11:13,700 --> 00:11:18,020
yeah, Xbox yeah. I really wanted a crawl space just to be laid down somewhere

173
00:11:18,020 --> 00:11:22,080
secret. There was a crawl space in my house, but it was there was a hole in

174
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:25,860
the roof type of vibe crawl space. Oh, we're not supposed to be into this part

175
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:26,300
of it

176
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:31,140
thinking about a saw. I told you guys that I used to talking about talking

177
00:11:31,140 --> 00:11:35,760
about talking about I used to work at a escape room in L. A. And there was one

178
00:11:35,780 --> 00:11:41,140
escape room that was cartel themed and that's insane. It opens in a you get you

179
00:11:41,140 --> 00:11:46,180
that is insane. That is it. Why would they have a cartel so you're trapped in

180
00:11:46,180 --> 00:11:49,580
a van because the cartel yeah exactly you're trapped in the you're talking

181
00:11:49,580 --> 00:11:53,220
about passenger van and then you have to get out and the way you get out is this

182
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:57,260
is if you want to impress any dates that you're taking to the sixty out escape

183
00:11:57,260 --> 00:12:01,180
rooms in silver. It's probably gone. It's probably gone by the way all this all

184
00:12:01,180 --> 00:12:04,500
the escape rooms that I worked for are controlled by like an actual Russian.

185
00:12:04,540 --> 00:12:09,200
How many did you work for just one, but the one location I worked for I went to

186
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:09,400
a

187
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:13,680
I went to like a award ceremony for the employees that worked there and they

188
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:14,200
were just like

189
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:19,400
like three like very old babushkas like counting hundred dollar bills while

190
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:22,840
they played candy crush. That's amazing. That's and yeah anyway

191
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:27,520
the traps are always broken. They were just pieces of shit, but there's this

192
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:31,880
one part of the puzzle where you had to rig like an actual car battery to this

193
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:35,760
like old school radio to get in touch with the outside so that you could call

194
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:40,000
for help, but the radio would never work. So we had to just call in and pretend to

195
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:44,600
be the guys in the cartel who the people who were paying to do it had earlier

196
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:47,040
heard. So we literally had to do a cholo impression

197
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:53,920
because they're supposed to be like overhearing the guys, but the audio

198
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:58,560
could never play, but they would do it right and it's so finicky to get the

199
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:03,960
that is a soft. You are you in your first, yeah, we you have to for years

200
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:07,180
to for years, you're going to you've done an impression of a like now with

201
00:13:07,180 --> 00:13:10,700
your friends. Now you have to do it for your job or you'll get fired.

202
00:13:10,700 --> 00:13:15,420
Yeah, I did and then so every time we did it, they were just go huh. I guess

203
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:20,700
that was a hint. I understand that we're yeah anyway. It was cool. It was a

204
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:24,140
good job. I did an escape room with my family wanted to do an escape room

205
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:28,560
and some of my extended family over zoom during covid is like remember that

206
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:32,280
was like a like a covid yeah. I was like oh you can do it. It was it wasn't it

207
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:36,420
wasn't we had to do that. Yeah, it was pretty horrible. It was like some guy

208
00:13:36,420 --> 00:13:39,800
in a like you know on zoom, but still wearing the mask because it's like early

209
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:44,080
covid. I feel like and he was like it was pirate themed, so he's like are you

210
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:48,480
resume and then it was like it was so horrible because they didn't even it

211
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:51,920
wasn't even that they had a camera and we're going through the room. It was

212
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:56,080
let's see what he does. I'll clean it on the cable. I'll clean it up.

213
00:13:56,080 --> 00:14:00,440
It's covered in plastic. I know, but I just want to give you some urgency

214
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:06,280
before I go any further before I go any further. The spiller we can over here.

215
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:11,440
You can let me finish yeah. It was so horrible because it was it wasn't even

216
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:14,720
that they had a camera inside the escape room. It was that they had like

217
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:18,280
essentially what we do for like they had like a slide show of like pictures of

218
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:21,720
stuff in the room yeah and everybody in my family was just slightly too old to

219
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:25,120
understand that was going on. So I click so they kept it less than a point in

220
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:27,640
clicking. It was like do you can you say the right thing so we can go to the

221
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:30,880
next slide and the yeah everybody kept asking every single slide like five

222
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:33,620
times. Do you have like a different angle of this? Can we look closer at

223
00:14:33,620 --> 00:14:36,680
this and the guy you just hear clicking noise and the guy would be like no, we

224
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:39,640
can't. Unfortunately, I can't get any closer and it was just it was just

225
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:43,680
pictures of like walls with like the classic like escape room, like like

226
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:47,960
codes and stuff. Can you zoom in and be like no at least that one has more free

227
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:50,760
will because when we had to do it over zoom, it was just like people would call

228
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:54,520
and it was just my friend Patrick holding a phone and just walking around the

229
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:55,560
escape room and they were like

230
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:59,760
can you go over there? I can

231
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:05,520
that's exactly what it was. It was like yeah, I guess we could go back to that,

232
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:10,440
but like yeah, I did an escape room twice with my family and the first one

233
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:15,000
we had like eleven people and we had to like convince the people like we because

234
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:18,920
six was the limit and we were like we really want eleven people to do it and a

235
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:22,520
one of us are kids and I was like thirteen or fourteen, and it was the

236
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:26,840
entire thing was my brother's ex girlfriend trying to figure out all the

237
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:32,400
math stuff in the thing and then me and the other boys in our cousin group

238
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:35,540
taking photos of each other with a disposable camera, having sex with a

239
00:15:35,540 --> 00:15:36,160
statue

240
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:42,760
that had boobs. Yeah, when I was in fourth grade, my grandma took me to an

241
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:47,400
escape room like back before I had any idea what it was, and it was ancient

242
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:50,380
Egypt themed and we went in and it was like the second room and they had a

243
00:15:50,380 --> 00:15:55,200
skeleton and it scared me so bad that I got sick to my stomach and I told the

244
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:58,620
employee that I had to leave and he took me out a secret exit and I waited for

245
00:15:58,620 --> 00:16:02,320
my my grandma finished the room by herself and I waited for myself. I

246
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:06,820
waited by myself in the lobby. You got scared by a skeleton. I was like I

247
00:16:06,820 --> 00:16:10,720
thought it was there so fucking I've never done an escape room. You can't

248
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:14,340
just don't let yourself. I only did that one and then I got taken on one at a

249
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:17,900
school trip and then the one on zoom. Yeah, we talked about that before like I

250
00:16:17,900 --> 00:16:20,000
almost I'd failed that interview so bad.

251
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:24,820
Oh, you know, I almost worked with the master himself. Wow, yeah, yeah, we've

252
00:16:24,820 --> 00:16:28,320
talked about that up and down. Yeah, but what I want to talk about is the

253
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:34,100
spiller right now. Why Mr Spill Mr Spill, Mr Spill, because the other day he

254
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:40,660
spilled Joe's coffee and instead of cleaning up the spill, he ran and got

255
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:45,340
another coffee and left all of the spill jumped out of the chair and said he

256
00:16:45,340 --> 00:16:48,900
you another one right now. I mean, only out of the door. The only reason he

257
00:16:48,900 --> 00:16:53,540
picked up the spill right now was to because he knew that we're going to tell

258
00:16:53,540 --> 00:16:57,280
this story. No, I don't care about this story. He knew it. I think that's a nice

259
00:16:57,280 --> 00:16:59,940
thing to do, Caleb, because you're counting on your friends to take care of

260
00:16:59,940 --> 00:17:06,460
the spill. The spill is did the spill cost you $4.50? What? Yes. And emotional

261
00:17:06,460 --> 00:17:11,040
little bit about you know what the still cost me this patch of table right here.

262
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:14,080
Yeah, that's a difference. That wasn't the only spill. That wasn't the why we

263
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:17,000
don't have to litigate this whole thing, but if so, if you go back now,

264
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:20,800
the podcast, by all means, put me on trial. Let's go put you on trial right

265
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:23,720
now. The table me on trial. You know this is more. I don't know if you watch

266
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:26,800
Oppenheimer. There's more of a hearing than a trial. You don't have a chance to

267
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:27,680
defend yourself, pal.

268
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:32,020
He's the guy from winning time that yells at Oppenheimer. I'm sorry. I use so

269
00:17:32,020 --> 00:17:36,200
many performance enhancing drinks where I'm so good at the podcast that I have to

270
00:17:36,220 --> 00:17:39,180
stick around and stick them around and spill them. Yeah, you guys imagine

271
00:17:39,180 --> 00:17:43,940
being the first person to have your pink nipples on IMAX color stock. Is that

272
00:17:43,940 --> 00:17:44,540
what that was?

273
00:17:44,540 --> 00:17:46,260
Yeah,

274
00:17:46,260 --> 00:17:49,020
I can't remember

275
00:17:49,020 --> 00:17:52,220
that's my Florence.

276
00:17:52,220 --> 00:17:57,380
Did you do that again? I like I like what you say, just one and a half more

277
00:17:57,380 --> 00:17:58,780
times long hair.

278
00:17:58,780 --> 00:18:04,660
No, she has a short hair. She's not quite so girly at all. Is she? No, but

279
00:18:04,700 --> 00:18:09,900
She has long hair in that movie, not quite it's pretty it's quite long. She

280
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:12,540
looks like she plays rugby. It's quite I like

281
00:18:12,540 --> 00:18:14,160
you like

282
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:16,560
I like

283
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:23,340
I can see you like that. Yes, not so much for me, but I'd like to fight her

284
00:18:23,340 --> 00:18:29,220
in an octagon. I'd like to fight her and lose. I'd like to fight her and lose a

285
00:18:29,220 --> 00:18:29,620
hundred

286
00:18:31,260 --> 00:18:35,140
it hurts so bad. Keep doing so fucking. It hurts so bad, but I'm still awake.

287
00:18:35,140 --> 00:18:39,140
Keep fighting me. Yeah, I would like to have a contest where she's only allowed

288
00:18:39,140 --> 00:18:42,660
to use her lower body and I'm only allowed to use the top of my head. You

289
00:18:42,660 --> 00:18:43,420
wanna what you wanna

290
00:18:43,420 --> 00:18:48,740
that's how we can have a co a co ed

291
00:18:48,740 --> 00:18:54,540
fighting. All right, I want a good clean fight.

292
00:18:54,540 --> 00:18:57,780
You can only use the top of your head.

293
00:18:58,780 --> 00:19:01,340
Florence, I'm going to tie your arms behind your back.

294
00:19:01,340 --> 00:19:02,760
Florence

295
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:07,340
her friends call you. It's not you

296
00:19:07,340 --> 00:19:12,060
who it's poo. Her name is close to pure bitches name.

297
00:19:12,060 --> 00:19:23,340
You can't keep

298
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:30,120
he learned how to break out of handcuffs just for the fight is doing David Blaine.

299
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:32,480
Yeah, I would like to do a fight where she's only allowed to use the soles of

300
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:34,300
her feet and I'm only allowed to use the tips of my

301
00:19:34,300 --> 00:19:38,340
of my tongue versus the bottom of your ass.

302
00:19:38,340 --> 00:19:46,240
I want a good clean fight, the bottom of no dirty business. What is the bottom

303
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:50,780
of the S, the the the the part of the back rest of the as she's where the

304
00:19:50,780 --> 00:19:52,000
as cheek falls over. That's

305
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:59,060
plastic falls falls over the leg over the butt. It honestly depends how big

306
00:19:59,060 --> 00:20:02,280
your butt is because some people's butts are so small that they're assholes on

307
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:07,180
the exact same topographical level as the tip of their cheek. That's the gym I

308
00:20:07,180 --> 00:20:13,080
go to is as an is having an epidemic of the bugs in most insanely fake asses of

309
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:16,720
all time, and they the women go in, they work out and like why are you doing

310
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:20,400
this? You like women with BBL, right? Yeah, women with like crazy. You

311
00:20:20,420 --> 00:20:24,760
downloaded a new avatar. I want to pretend to get to grind through and it's

312
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:27,380
always a woman. You spent riot points. You don't need the

313
00:20:27,380 --> 00:20:28,180
I

314
00:20:28,180 --> 00:20:31,900
what are you doing? You already bought this.

315
00:20:31,900 --> 00:20:37,680
It's always a woman who has like no neck at all, just like head bolted onto

316
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:42,300
the shoulders. Yeah, she's got it. She's got a BBL still biggest, all the

317
00:20:42,300 --> 00:20:46,100
skinny, skinny chicken legs, all the fat they moved up to her neck. Yeah, it's

318
00:20:46,140 --> 00:20:47,140
It's kind of crazy, man.

319
00:20:47,140 --> 00:20:51,620
I want to pretend to get a BBL just so I can sit backwards on a plane.

320
00:20:51,620 --> 00:20:52,780
You can do that already.

321
00:20:52,780 --> 00:20:53,780
You can just do that.

322
00:20:53,780 --> 00:20:54,780
I was on a plane on the...

323
00:20:54,780 --> 00:20:55,780
I just want to just...

324
00:20:55,780 --> 00:20:59,620
Just sitting like this on a plane with my flat ass is such a funny...

325
00:20:59,620 --> 00:21:01,940
I would love to be sitting on a...

326
00:21:01,940 --> 00:21:04,900
Women who get BBLs can't sit on the flight.

327
00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:09,420
There's like women who like can only pay for the BBL, so then they go on the plane and

328
00:21:09,420 --> 00:21:13,340
then there's just like videos of just like people walking by and it's just like two girls

329
00:21:13,340 --> 00:21:15,420
sitting backwards with gigantic asses.

330
00:21:15,420 --> 00:21:19,720
facing the head of the sea. I would love to be sitting next to a girl having

331
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:23,600
doing that and being like what are you doing and she says I just got a BBL. I

332
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:24,880
say you got a bubble.

333
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:27,920
It's actually B U B B L.

334
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:29,920
You stupid

335
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:32,640
I went on a

336
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:34,240
sweater, best

337
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:37,260
nerd glasses

338
00:21:37,260 --> 00:21:40,480
a dumb B L

339
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:43,740
B L. They bring you a B B.

340
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:47,920
they bring you a you B B L Y for the adjective. They bring you on that

341
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:51,520
fucking podcast called like what that that whatever yeah, whatever and then

342
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:54,760
it's just you and the fucking sweater vest and the big glasses and is like

343
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:57,300
this nerd owns these only

344
00:21:57,300 --> 00:22:03,720
you got a boob job. You mean you gave a blow job

345
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:09,320
I went on a plane, Cameron, the nerd

346
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:16,920
lower third. Like that fucking sixteen year old Israeli kid, you like blow up

347
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:17,480
like that?

348
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:21,400
I went to, I went to... Bill Clinton actually couldn't be president, he was

349
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:23,680
already president twice. I went to,

350
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:30,880
on a plane, I went to on a plane and I had a, speaking of planes, this was a

351
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:36,200
Spirit Air plane to Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, and there was, on the plane it

352
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:41,240
was like 50 people, just normal people from New York and then 50 like Hasidic

353
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:44,120
children who had never been on an airplane before and thought it was the

354
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:48,520
most amazing thing ever. Yeah. And they were running around, like I didn't know

355
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:51,840
this was allowed and now I want to do this next time I go on a plane. Once they

356
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:56,760
turn the seatbelt sign off, you can run up and down and hit each other. Well,

357
00:22:56,760 --> 00:22:59,520
it's allowed for kids. I don't think that you can do that. It's allowed for

358
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:04,480
adults. Well, I mean, it would be funny if, like, you saw all of that and then

359
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:08,300
you just like all the kids running up and down the aisle. You see that you

360
00:23:08,300 --> 00:23:11,800
immediately unbuckle. You try to join them and you're just like Billy. I

361
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:15,740
wanted to I wanted to one of the kids across the plane. One of them dropped a

362
00:23:15,740 --> 00:23:18,520
bracelet and I picked it up and I said here you go and I would have said it's

363
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:21,720
my now. Have you guys ever gone and asked for more snacks on the plane? Yes,

364
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:26,380
well, actually, I can get up and get the cheese. It's a jet blue has a tree

365
00:23:26,380 --> 00:23:29,340
with unlimited snacks. Well, not a blue, but you've asked this. Have you ever

366
00:23:29,340 --> 00:23:32,380
as basically like asking to get more farts on the plane? Which is my

367
00:23:33,980 --> 00:23:35,780
I actually fart a thousand more times. I

368
00:23:35,780 --> 00:23:41,640
fart. I think I save up all my farts throughout the months and then, as soon

369
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:46,980
as I get on a plane, I let them out. So you know, it's crazy about the plane. I

370
00:23:46,980 --> 00:23:50,500
get on the plane having to shit and I get off the plane, not having to shit.

371
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:53,780
It is a pressure and the pressure on your stomach is building, but it doesn't

372
00:23:53,780 --> 00:23:56,860
turn solid waste into vapor. Does it? Yes, it does.

373
00:23:56,860 --> 00:24:02,060
It's a pressure. Look at a bag. Look at a bag of some chips when you're like

374
00:24:02,100 --> 00:24:06,460
got the plan and I made one a hundred foot long unbroken spaghetti noodle.

375
00:24:06,460 --> 00:24:09,680
Yeah, every time you make an eel yeah when I

376
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:16,900
every time I get off the plane, you go up right and that's pushing the poop

377
00:24:16,900 --> 00:24:21,420
down a little bit right, but then you go down to land and the poop is flying up

378
00:24:21,420 --> 00:24:24,700
your body and turning back into food. Yeah, it's getting another chance at

379
00:24:24,700 --> 00:24:29,060
digest. Yeah, that makes that's why your food when you get off a plane is crazy.

380
00:24:29,620 --> 00:24:32,920
Everything the time of Adderall shits. I feel like Adderall shits is the whole

381
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:36,920
point of Adderall. Like I don't even I think that taking that kind of shit is

382
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:40,220
what motivates me to work for the rest of the day. That's why I like coffee.

383
00:24:40,220 --> 00:24:44,120
Yeah, you like coffee. I've been getting into coffee. I love look at that.

384
00:24:44,120 --> 00:24:46,020
You like coffee. I don't like coffee.

385
00:24:46,020 --> 00:24:49,320
That's why I like coffee. I've been drinking so much more coffee recently.

386
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:52,820
I think you. Because of this new store. Yeah, me too. It makes you have insane

387
00:24:52,820 --> 00:24:55,720
food. I think I have two cold brews a day now, which is insane. I'm always

388
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:58,720
getting three cold brews a day with cream. I don't get that. Just cold brew

389
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:02,560
milk cream. I'm getting black. I always I always force myself to have usually I

390
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:07,080
try to make myself have half a cup of coffee a day and that's my my top level

391
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:12,080
max to try and give myself a healthy body. Yeah, but recently it's been a

392
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:16,240
coffee. It's good for a cup of coffee from the store and this will this is

393
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:19,720
rocket fuel. It's changing me. It's a different type of coffee than what I

394
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:23,720
make in my Mr. Coffee machine from 1995. I have coffee's a good brand. I'm gonna

395
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:27,320
go pee and I've been the one I've been completely pooping so much. We're gonna

396
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:29,920
off the cameras and do an audio only throwback right yeah.

397
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:31,320
All right. Yeah. Fuck it.

398
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:32,020
Of what?

399
00:25:32,020 --> 00:25:32,600
Fuck it.

400
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:33,600
Of podcast about list.

401
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:35,440
Let's just say fuck it and close all the cameras right now.

402
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:35,940
Yeah.

403
00:25:35,940 --> 00:25:36,700
Um.

404
00:25:36,700 --> 00:25:37,640
That's one.

405
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:38,680
That's one.

406
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:42,120
We were talking about airplane shits, but every single time that I've.

407
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:43,120
I can never shit on an airplane.

408
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:47,680
Every single time I've gotten off a plane has been the worst gas I've ever had in my entire life.

409
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:49,520
Have you ever farted in an Uber?

410
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:50,060
You know what?

411
00:25:50,060 --> 00:25:52,000
Have you ever had to fart so bad that you have to pee?

412
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:52,660
Yes.

413
00:25:52,660 --> 00:25:53,480
All the time.

414
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:55,640
But I hate shitting on planes.

415
00:25:55,640 --> 00:25:56,480
I won't shit on a plane.

416
00:25:56,640 --> 00:26:02,660
but I love uber, but I love sitting on the am track sitting on the am tracking

417
00:26:02,660 --> 00:26:05,780
oh yeah thrown around. You have to hold on to the handles next to the toilet,

418
00:26:05,780 --> 00:26:09,260
so do not get thrown off and shit onto the floor by accident. I'll never when

419
00:26:09,260 --> 00:26:12,740
you have to piss and you have to put your you have to leave your entire body

420
00:26:12,740 --> 00:26:16,380
yeah, it's a jerk off just so you can get a boner just yeah, just to piss can

421
00:26:16,380 --> 00:26:20,100
fly out of your boner like straw into the toilet. You know what I'm talking

422
00:26:20,100 --> 00:26:23,820
about where you have to you have to get a bigger reach. So you get your you give

423
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:26,640
- Why does it feel like, why does it feel like

424
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:29,520
every time I go on the Amtrak and I need to pee,

425
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:32,460
it's smooth sailing, but the second I get into the bathroom

426
00:26:32,460 --> 00:26:34,660
and I lock the door with that strange lock

427
00:26:34,660 --> 00:26:37,820
that looks like an alien's antenna or a robot's wiener.

428
00:26:37,820 --> 00:26:38,660
- A red robot's wiener.

429
00:26:38,660 --> 00:26:40,080
- The train starts bouncing around

430
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:42,980
like we just hit some turbulence on the track.

431
00:26:42,980 --> 00:26:44,160
- Right, before you know it,

432
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:47,200
this train was built by toddlers, the track.

433
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:49,520
- Exactly, I feel like I go into the bathroom

434
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:52,800
and I get teleported to a train in Topsy Turvy World

435
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:57,940
or a roller coaster. Yeah, and I guess that must be because of something weird

436
00:26:57,940 --> 00:27:01,820
right and maybe it's the north. It must be a phenomenon and people in the

437
00:27:01,820 --> 00:27:06,860
northeast been knew about this. God damn, I do love the in track bathroom.

438
00:27:06,860 --> 00:27:10,860
The best shit I can ever take, though, is that like a gelson's or just any

439
00:27:10,860 --> 00:27:15,340
grocery store, just an upscale grocery store. Oh, there one. Oh yeah, you just

440
00:27:15,340 --> 00:27:20,580
go in there by yourself. No one's not. I so I got off a plane one time,

441
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:24,280
gotten an Uber and then I don't know if it was just because I think I was leaving like

442
00:27:24,280 --> 00:27:29,960
the yeah, I think it was I don't remember what I think was leaving La and I must have

443
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:35,600
ate at that fucking rock and roll restaurant at La X and I just had the worst gas in my

444
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:41,300
entire life and I just remember farting in this Uber and it was like a silent like really

445
00:27:41,300 --> 00:27:47,200
really disguster silent disguster and I was like I hope that doesn't smell. I hope that

446
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:50,460
that doesn't smell and then like a minute later, I just see the Uber driver

447
00:27:50,460 --> 00:27:55,940
just open the window. I was like I see the Uber driver just open the window. I

448
00:27:55,940 --> 00:27:56,160
took

449
00:27:56,160 --> 00:28:01,540
one of the more recent a few weeks ago. I took a shit in a public bathroom in a

450
00:28:01,540 --> 00:28:04,820
public library. Yeah, I think it was the one near Barkley Center, maybe and you

451
00:28:04,820 --> 00:28:09,460
wiped with a book and I went in there. I went down. It's been so first of all,

452
00:28:09,460 --> 00:28:13,500
I haven't been in a library since yeah yeah forever, but this was the craziest

453
00:28:13,540 --> 00:28:17,780
public bath. I went down there was a like a room like kind of like a big like

454
00:28:17,780 --> 00:28:21,220
studio, you know that you could like rent out for events and the basement of

455
00:28:21,220 --> 00:28:24,820
the library where the bathroom was and there was a group of people who were

456
00:28:24,820 --> 00:28:29,080
like being taught how to walk the runway. Like it was like everyone like doing

457
00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:32,300
runway walks and someone like going like okay now like like and they were doing a

458
00:28:32,300 --> 00:28:37,380
whole thing and I go into the bathroom and it's three stalls. The ones on the on

459
00:28:37,380 --> 00:28:41,860
the outside edges are taken and I so I go into the middle one to take a shit and

460
00:28:41,900 --> 00:28:47,040
they're both the guys on both sides of me are smoking, clearly smoking and

461
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:47,940
they're both just

462
00:28:47,940 --> 00:28:51,440
they're both the entire time. I was trying like the fastest shit I ever

463
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:53,380
took as I was like I need to get out here. They're both just going like

464
00:28:53,380 --> 00:29:02,640
it was so horrible. I would love to smoke on the toilet yeah, just two guys

465
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:06,880
smoking on the toilet of one stall apart and you're both groaning literally

466
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:11,440
both identically doing the public bath. They're both stress grown yeah. They're

467
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:14,940
with two models. They're both stressed. They're studying upstairs probably.

468
00:29:14,940 --> 00:29:17,360
That's why they're in the public library, right? They're probably to walk

469
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:21,100
for a Louis V. They probably are so fucking stressed that they have to go

470
00:29:21,100 --> 00:29:23,580
take a shit and smoke, because they don't have the time. It's like they're

471
00:29:23,580 --> 00:29:27,000
models, too. If they were walking runways, they are models. So that means

472
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,360
that this is like the only poop that they have in a long time. I do not,

473
00:29:28,360 --> 00:29:31,680
listen, from what I could tell, what I could see of these guys' feet,

474
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:35,720
these were not models. Yeah. Well, they're not foot models. Yeah. I bet

475
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:39,880
they were really skinny, though. No, these were normal guys. I don't think

476
00:29:39,900 --> 00:29:41,500
librarians. Yes,

477
00:29:41,500 --> 00:29:48,400
I love taking those shits that do feel like you're pouring like you're dumping

478
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:49,020
a bucket.

479
00:29:49,020 --> 00:29:51,260
And it's just when you have it or when you haven't heard it,

480
00:29:51,260 --> 00:29:56,380
I hate to get out of here taken. It is a crazy, it's a crazy of like,

481
00:29:56,380 --> 00:29:57,740
Oh my God, I can go fast.

482
00:29:57,740 --> 00:30:01,660
There's something like that's similar to diarrhea where you're dropping turds,

483
00:30:01,660 --> 00:30:05,180
but it's like that scene in aliens where the alien queen is laying her eggs and

484
00:30:05,180 --> 00:30:09,020
each egg has that layer of slime. You haven't sloppy posit or you don't have a

485
00:30:09,020 --> 00:30:12,820
what anymore. Yeah, exactly. I feel like each turd has like this little, this

486
00:30:12,820 --> 00:30:16,620
go bot that's attached to it, like this little layer of... It has a film. Yeah,

487
00:30:16,620 --> 00:30:20,720
exactly, like each, each turd is wearing a condom and it's sliding out. That is

488
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:23,500
very, very nice. None of it is nice to me. 'Cause you can just kind of machine

489
00:30:23,500 --> 00:30:26,380
gun those out, and they're not even like tiny rabbit pellets, they're like... And

490
00:30:26,380 --> 00:30:28,740
it's not that they're bad, yeah, they're right, they're simply fast. It's not

491
00:30:28,740 --> 00:30:32,020
that they're bad, they're not foul, they're not so rotten, they're just nice

492
00:30:32,020 --> 00:30:35,940
to do. I wish, no worse than a normal poop. I wish that I could never, like, I

493
00:30:35,980 --> 00:30:40,880
that something happened where it's like I could eat as much food as I want and I never had

494
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:42,300
to take a shit ever again.

495
00:30:42,300 --> 00:30:46,100
I wish that's what visiting the south is like after having a yankee lifestyle I think.

496
00:30:46,100 --> 00:30:47,100
Yeah?

497
00:30:47,100 --> 00:30:48,100
Yeah I think well I don't know about you guys.

498
00:30:48,100 --> 00:30:49,100
What are you talking about?

499
00:30:49,100 --> 00:30:51,700
Visiting the south eating all that fried food and like barbeque.

500
00:30:51,700 --> 00:30:52,700
I can save it up.

501
00:30:52,700 --> 00:30:54,140
I can save that up.

502
00:30:54,140 --> 00:30:55,380
You can save up your poops.

503
00:30:55,380 --> 00:30:56,940
I can save up fried food for sure.

504
00:30:56,940 --> 00:30:59,620
I constipate myself on purpose every few weeks.

505
00:30:59,620 --> 00:31:01,900
What do you mean save up fried food?

506
00:31:01,900 --> 00:31:05,060
I don't have to get, I get constipated after eating a ton of fried food.

507
00:31:05,060 --> 00:31:06,060
I don't know about you. I don't.

508
00:31:06,060 --> 00:31:07,060
Yeah, me too.

509
00:31:07,060 --> 00:31:08,060
The oil is mixed with my stomach.

510
00:31:08,060 --> 00:31:11,060
We have a seed oil, some kind of...

511
00:31:11,060 --> 00:31:12,060
An allergy.

512
00:31:12,060 --> 00:31:13,060
Allergy to it.

513
00:31:13,060 --> 00:31:14,060
Yeah.

514
00:31:14,060 --> 00:31:16,060
Yeah, I just, I get constipated anytime I'm not at home.

515
00:31:16,060 --> 00:31:17,060
Yeah.

516
00:31:17,060 --> 00:31:18,060
That's what I mean.

517
00:31:18,060 --> 00:31:19,060
I think vacation you're gonna...

518
00:31:19,060 --> 00:31:22,060
I built up some kind of natural immune system defense to having to poop when I'm not in my apartment.

519
00:31:22,060 --> 00:31:23,060
Every single time.

520
00:31:23,060 --> 00:31:24,060
You're lucky.

521
00:31:24,060 --> 00:31:29,060
Even if I'm on, even if I'm visiting home from here, I won't shit the entire time.

522
00:31:29,060 --> 00:31:34,060
I have to take a shit right now and I'm not gonna go take a shit because we're recording.

523
00:31:34,060 --> 00:31:36,060
Like you're trying to censor it

524
00:31:36,060 --> 00:31:39,540
Right now

525
00:31:39,540 --> 00:31:48,660
Yeah, what you have a list of talk about we have what you're doing is weird man, what's weird

526
00:31:48,660 --> 00:31:53,380
That's what my stepdad does instead of cussing. Yeah. Yeah, he says what I'm doing stepdaddy moves

527
00:31:53,380 --> 00:31:55,860
That's what the Mormon kid at my school want to

528
00:32:02,260 --> 00:32:05,020
stepdads to talk about being a stepdad. And today the our

529
00:32:05,020 --> 00:32:11,060
clicker is broken, so sorry to the audio listeners, but you're going to have

530
00:32:11,060 --> 00:32:16,260
to hear me say next. Wait, before we go any- should I not talk about the

531
00:32:16,260 --> 00:32:20,660
Christmas podcast you found or? I want to do a full expose on this Christmas

532
00:32:20,660 --> 00:32:24,660
podcast. Because I said that there should be a podcast for stepdads to talk

533
00:32:24,660 --> 00:32:28,460
about being stepdads. And there basically already is one, but it's also about

534
00:32:28,460 --> 00:32:32,020
Christmas. Yeah, well, save it. It's Christmas, but for- Save it for a

535
00:32:32,060 --> 00:32:35,480
months from now that that video you sent me is one of the funniest things I've

536
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:38,540
ever really good and everyone else is going to have to wait till December.

537
00:32:38,540 --> 00:32:44,040
So Cameron, I'm getting where this is the first ever double list on P. A. I

538
00:32:44,040 --> 00:32:46,960
don't know where you heard that okay. Well, it says we've done plenty of

539
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:50,680
double list before I didn't make that slide. Jubio made that just now. Oh,

540
00:32:50,680 --> 00:32:53,720
because you don't put the yeah, I don't put titles, so I must have made that

541
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:58,720
just damn. I'm lying guys. It's the first ever double with let's fucking

542
00:32:58,740 --> 00:33:02,740
your type of double. I don't mean to list one after the other guys. I mean a

543
00:33:02,740 --> 00:33:07,440
double list, and this is on a next please. This is on a website called

544
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:10,200
wonders list, and you can see here the different

545
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:16,240
categories on this website. People, animals, travel, most expensive, bizarre,

546
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:20,780
net worth and Michelin. We should put a net worth section on our that's a

547
00:33:20,780 --> 00:33:24,300
really on your website, yeah, 'cause it's all just like made up information.

548
00:33:24,300 --> 00:33:28,020
Can you hire somebody to calculate your net worth? He's got the biggest net

549
00:33:28,060 --> 00:33:32,140
My net worth is about $500,000 right now due to the properties that I own in New

550
00:33:32,140 --> 00:33:37,680
York City. My net worth is probably... Me and him are both basically negative,

551
00:33:37,680 --> 00:33:39,880
tens of thousands of negative. We are struggling every month. Are you guys

552
00:33:39,880 --> 00:33:42,180
Google-able net worth wise? Can you Google your guys' self-made... Yeah,

553
00:33:42,180 --> 00:33:46,000
let's Google it right now. There's no way. Search Caleb Pitt's net worth.

554
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:50,260
If it says anything more than minus $50,000, then I'm gonna be so mad. Yeah,

555
00:33:50,260 --> 00:33:53,320
there's no way that my net worth is good at all.

556
00:33:53,320 --> 00:33:56,380
My credit is bad. There's no way you guys are Google-able net worth wise.

557
00:33:56,380 --> 00:34:03,100
no no no no no no no don't look it up on the Adam Friedland show wait Caleb

558
00:34:03,100 --> 00:34:05,840
pits was on the Adam Fried Caleb pits, nineteen seventy five

559
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:11,060
here we go here. We go Patrick Doran net worth way. Let's go.

560
00:34:11,060 --> 00:34:15,900
One million dollars, Patrick Joseph, Mr Doran owns over fourteen thousand nine

561
00:34:15,900 --> 00:34:19,740
hundred and seventy three units of Synchronos Technologies Inc stock and

562
00:34:19,740 --> 00:34:22,180
over the last fourteen years. Oh my God, look at how this stock has been

563
00:34:22,220 --> 00:34:26,680
dropping. I have been waiting to talk about this for months. This is a

564
00:34:26,680 --> 00:34:29,920
horrible way. Look at that. Grab this has to be about the

565
00:34:29,920 --> 00:34:35,920
this. You need to take this has to be about the Irish rally cross driver that

566
00:34:35,920 --> 00:34:39,400
I share a name with yeah, it's got to be. I guess it would be funnier if it

567
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:40,880
was you, but it has to be

568
00:34:40,880 --> 00:34:46,860
no, no, no, no, I can't let I can't let people think that I have money.

569
00:34:46,860 --> 00:34:51,180
Yeah, people really thought it's actually fire to be broke. Nowadays,

570
00:34:51,220 --> 00:34:55,800
it's really cool. It's gonna be rolling in the about these hominid networks.

571
00:34:55,800 --> 00:35:00,380
So this is wonders list and I made this slide show a while ago, so I don't

572
00:35:00,380 --> 00:35:03,700
remember what's on it. So next please, so it's a surprise to all of us. So

573
00:35:03,700 --> 00:35:07,480
here it's a double whoa. So we've got two different lists from wonders list

574
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:12,780
on the left. We have top ten reasons men are better than women by war da

575
00:35:12,780 --> 00:35:16,740
Hajra. What are top ten reasons men are better than women? The debate is

576
00:35:16,740 --> 00:35:20,180
perhaps the most long standing one as men have been trying to prove their

577
00:35:20,220 --> 00:35:23,920
superiority over women since the beginning of time. It gave birth to

578
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:28,660
masterpieces like men are from Mars and women are from Venus, yet either side

579
00:35:28,660 --> 00:35:33,060
has been unable to prove their point to an absolute extent. What reasons could

580
00:35:33,060 --> 00:35:36,820
men give in favor of their awesomeness? Take a look and then coming in on the

581
00:35:36,820 --> 00:35:40,720
right side, we got ten reasons why women are better than men, also by Ward

582
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:45,820
Ahasra. This is a truly awesome list and we had a lot of fun compiling it.

583
00:35:45,820 --> 00:35:49,220
The debate about who is better will continue in the long term, but

584
00:35:49,260 --> 00:35:54,140
meanwhile, let's enjoy both the lists of the series compiled listed blow are the

585
00:35:54,140 --> 00:35:57,820
top ten reasons why women are better than I think men already win because it's a

586
00:35:57,820 --> 00:36:01,960
longer pair. Yeah, I say I'm already sensing a by women list says this is a

587
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:06,200
truly awesome list. These doesn't not say that on the other side. Can we look

588
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:06,480
up

589
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:07,840
analyze

590
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:13,940
I gotta say these thumbnails couldn't be more obvious about you know who's being

591
00:36:13,940 --> 00:36:18,460
prioritized here, at least at the outset. I mean men are having a smiley time with

592
00:36:18,500 --> 00:36:22,480
girlfriends and and I will say that all these people are white and then we have

593
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:24,200
two black people who are on wrestling

594
00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:26,120
inside

595
00:36:26,120 --> 00:36:30,280
and I feel like one on the right side is a very good optical illusion where

596
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:32,080
you're supposed to see a lobsters claw.

597
00:36:32,080 --> 00:36:35,760
I think you might be right.

598
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:41,060
I thought it was a leprechaun drawers. Okay,

599
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:48,680
sagging leopard and you know what this is just it just goes to show that the

600
00:36:48,680 --> 00:36:53,360
gender of women is all about conflict with men. Okay, gender of men is all

601
00:36:53,360 --> 00:36:57,240
about being here on the beach. Wardah Hajra is a woman

602
00:36:57,240 --> 00:36:59,160
biased,

603
00:36:59,160 --> 00:37:04,000
so let's go next here. Let's check out bias towards men. Reason number ten,

604
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:08,480
this is a look at how she's actually fucking beautiful as fuck. Look at how

605
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:12,920
wow, which is the go pro. Whoa, I didn't even know. Did you guys ever use

606
00:37:12,920 --> 00:37:13,560
I jiggle

607
00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:14,560
I

608
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:18,520
can't say I've used I jiggle

609
00:37:18,520 --> 00:37:20,240
heard of it. I think

610
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:22,880
all right.

611
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:24,160
What is

612
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:30,280
an iPod touch app where you could put a picture of Megan Fox and touch her

613
00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:30,520
O,

614
00:37:30,520 --> 00:37:31,680
and then you

615
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:36,880
tell a rometer no you are you are you can shake the phone. You can shake the

616
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:41,360
phone. She would jiggle against her will. She is so sexual,

617
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:45,680
even the word itself. Each of these let's kind of compare and contrast

618
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:48,720
these. I think each of these because they even linked the each list on

619
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:51,000
each other's list. I think you're supposed to take them together. It's

620
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,480
a double list, so we're going to look at each reason and kind of do a

621
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:57,560
versus here. Okay, so here we have number ten for men. Men think sex

622
00:37:57,560 --> 00:38:01,560
and love are different in today's world. It is very common to have sex

623
00:38:01,560 --> 00:38:04,280
after a few days into the relationship, and yet women would call it

624
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:07,320
humiliating. If the guy ditched them right after having what he wanted,

625
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:11,160
man, on the other hand, would never curl up in fetal position and cry for

626
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:15,200
the blondie who didn't call them the next day after their one night stand and for

627
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:17,260
women ten women grow

628
00:38:17,260 --> 00:38:22,880
other human beings inside them. Women have the capacity to grow an entire new

629
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:26,920
person inside of them. Men, on the other hand, make sperms that look like

630
00:38:26,920 --> 00:38:31,240
tadpoles and don't even know which way to go until they accidentally budge into

631
00:38:31,240 --> 00:38:33,320
an egg inside the females body.

632
00:38:33,320 --> 00:38:38,940
That is all the role they play while a woman carries a moving, kicking grown.

633
00:38:38,980 --> 00:38:43,860
I'm going to keep it real. This does not feel band for band. No, this feels like

634
00:38:43,860 --> 00:38:48,620
like this is not an equal. No, we're going to be seeing a lot of stuff like

635
00:38:48,620 --> 00:38:53,820
that. Okay, these lists okay, but it is true that men's sperms don't even know

636
00:38:53,820 --> 00:38:54,260
which way

637
00:38:54,260 --> 00:39:00,020
fucking stupid. I sometimes are the stupidest trying to diss my sperms.

638
00:39:00,020 --> 00:39:04,820
Women make eggs, which are just balls. Yeah, we are there like a tadpole

639
00:39:04,820 --> 00:39:08,020
without the tail. It's like a worse sperm. I don't understand one of these

640
00:39:08,060 --> 00:39:14,860
there's a fact about like the men side. Well, I don't understand what men think.

641
00:39:14,860 --> 00:39:18,340
How is that number ten for why they're better? Because women don't think that

642
00:39:18,340 --> 00:39:20,980
they're different? Because men don't. Because women get obsessed. Okay, so

643
00:39:20,980 --> 00:39:25,900
women get emotional. Women catch feelings. An example is the photo here,

644
00:39:25,900 --> 00:39:30,420
the image, is that they're sharing a Coca-Cola or maybe talking to a small

645
00:39:30,420 --> 00:39:35,660
alien. What the caption should say is the woman in this situation thinks that

646
00:39:35,660 --> 00:39:39,980
she may become pregnant as a result of this interact. This really is just

647
00:39:39,980 --> 00:39:44,980
women are smarter than women is right. Yes, entry and it doesn't even say no.

648
00:39:44,980 --> 00:39:47,100
It just says when men think men

649
00:39:47,100 --> 00:39:52,540
men have an idea of these two things they think about things like this. Yeah,

650
00:39:52,540 --> 00:39:57,580
all right, let's go to number nine here. So number nine men are stronger.

651
00:39:57,580 --> 00:40:02,460
Their upper body is very strong as compared to women, and to be very honest,

652
00:40:02,500 --> 00:40:06,800
even the world seems to be designed along this fact, rather than the delicacy of

653
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:11,280
women. This is probably why they make the lawn mower string so hard. I've never

654
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:14,960
even noticed they're hard number nine for women. They can tolerate. They can

655
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:19,080
tolerate pain, like having a baby push through yourself is not enough. Once

656
00:40:19,080 --> 00:40:22,920
they do it again and yet again, women have a greater tolerance for pain as

657
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:26,840
they would go on doing all their chores for the whole nine months. Men, on the

658
00:40:26,840 --> 00:40:30,760
other hand, would hide under the sheets if they have flu. So they're saying

659
00:40:31,080 --> 00:40:35,780
doesn't matter how strong men are and how much they hit women with their strong

660
00:40:35,780 --> 00:40:40,040
hands. Women can take it because they can tolerate pain way, way more. If these

661
00:40:40,040 --> 00:40:43,120
are can't even tolerate flu, if these are twin lists,

662
00:40:43,120 --> 00:40:46,400
and they go together, that's what they're saying, what they're saying.

663
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:51,000
Yeah, what we have right here is just DPS versus tank. Exactly. Women are pure

664
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:56,180
tanks. They're spongy. Yeah, they're fun. Exactly. Men are DPS. They're this is

665
00:40:56,200 --> 00:40:59,260
but what a demo man yeah man have a forty five.

666
00:40:59,260 --> 00:41:00,760
Women are higher.

667
00:41:00,760 --> 00:41:05,720
Oh yeah, heavy. Well, I guess women can also tolerate fire. There's a theory

668
00:41:05,720 --> 00:41:06,640
that I'd like to show you.

669
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:08,920
Tolerate fire would be another good. Yeah,

670
00:41:08,920 --> 00:41:15,440
maybe could be they hide under the sheets if they have the flu. God damn on

671
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:18,960
the other hand, there's a lot of on the other hand, I do have a very low

672
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:22,840
tolerance for pain and bad feelings and

673
00:41:24,520 --> 00:41:30,640
Yeah, see I you know I like shit pain. Yes, did you pinch me don't pitch me

674
00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:35,200
again? I say uncle when you're a girl, wait Patrick, a woman, he's a girl. No

675
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:35,520
wait,

676
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:40,480
I can feel it now because my jacket is heavy. Oh, you got delayed response that

677
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:44,960
hurt me so bad because I'm so manly and he barely felt the pinch that I did to

678
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:46,000
him. We do it again.

679
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:50,720
I didn't even pitch him. That was a test. I did not even pinch him. You know

680
00:41:50,740 --> 00:41:55,040
but I it's I think that maybe I have a can tolerate some pain, but I what I

681
00:41:55,040 --> 00:41:58,140
can't tolerate it's true that I don't think I can tolerate the flu or having a

682
00:41:58,140 --> 00:42:03,740
stomach. No, no, no bubble, definitely the you eat a bad food and it's like you

683
00:42:03,740 --> 00:42:07,500
got shot and use yet. You see me out here every day living my life yeah.

684
00:42:07,500 --> 00:42:11,860
Here's another point for us guys wait, so that means you're a woman yeah,

685
00:42:11,860 --> 00:42:13,020
you can handle the pain.

686
00:42:13,020 --> 00:42:15,700
He's like a woman. You're like

687
00:42:15,700 --> 00:42:17,660
in our favorities

688
00:42:18,900 --> 00:42:22,820
women. Well, I get that from my mom yeah, that's what I get from my mom.

689
00:42:22,820 --> 00:42:26,340
Yeah, for my dad, I get that I really don't like having a stomach ache, but

690
00:42:26,340 --> 00:42:30,020
for my mom I get that I can just take a pepto and go about my day. Men are

691
00:42:30,020 --> 00:42:33,880
always saying uncle when they experience pain right like right or when they're

692
00:42:33,880 --> 00:42:37,400
being tickled. I think nerds are saying that yeah, nurse is saying uncle sure

693
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:39,700
or boy. There's no such thing as a nerd, yeah,

694
00:42:39,700 --> 00:42:43,780
but women are always saying uncle when they have too much pleasure. They say

695
00:42:43,780 --> 00:42:46,800
I'm not in the mood or stop

696
00:42:47,780 --> 00:42:51,280
I'm saying when a woman is experiencing a lot of pleasure. They go like uncle

697
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:57,280
oh uncle like that. This definitely needs further research. Yeah

698
00:42:57,280 --> 00:43:01,960
yeah, well, there was going on a diet with too much cupcakes.

699
00:43:01,960 --> 00:43:03,280
What

700
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:09,460
you're like? Oh, please no more cupcakes, uncle uncle, whereas men will eat an

701
00:43:09,460 --> 00:43:12,520
infinite cupcakes, uncle, maybe that's going to be less. Is that what you're

702
00:43:12,520 --> 00:43:14,320
saying? It would be an infinite cupcake

703
00:43:14,320 --> 00:43:15,840
and

704
00:43:17,720 --> 00:43:21,260
I just feel like women are always wait the infinite cupcake. This is a

705
00:43:21,260 --> 00:43:23,660
paradox here because it's like at the

706
00:43:23,660 --> 00:43:28,920
listen to this here, right of infinite just you you're eating the top part of

707
00:43:28,920 --> 00:43:31,320
the cupcake first and you never have to eat the bottom part.

708
00:43:31,320 --> 00:43:34,840
That's a paradox. Oh, my God,

709
00:43:34,840 --> 00:43:40,040
that's a so which part of the so why even make the bottom part, but do you

710
00:43:40,040 --> 00:43:43,320
need the bottom part to be in? I like the bottom, which part of the cupcake

711
00:43:43,320 --> 00:43:46,520
is female. I don't like those muffins. I don't like the muffin. You like bread.

712
00:43:46,600 --> 00:43:50,680
give me the muffin bottoms. Shut up man, you like bread. I want to eat the

713
00:43:50,680 --> 00:43:53,640
bottoms of the muffins. You've been lying. You can't eat bottoms of muffins.

714
00:43:53,640 --> 00:43:58,120
Yeah, I can know you eat lettuce burgers. How do you all eat your Reese's?

715
00:43:58,120 --> 00:44:02,520
First, I lick off all the chocolate, then I put the peanut butter in the

716
00:44:02,520 --> 00:44:07,320
freezer and I eat it a week later. I wrap it in the paper. I eat

717
00:44:07,320 --> 00:44:12,960
it in the paper. I put the Reese's on the roof of my mouth, all the chocolate,

718
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:15,840
- Can I hold the peanut butter and I scoop it into the paper

719
00:44:15,840 --> 00:44:17,080
and throw it in the fridge?

720
00:44:17,080 --> 00:44:19,080
- 'Cause sometimes you take the Reese's off the wrapper

721
00:44:19,080 --> 00:44:21,760
and a little bit of chocolate islands are left.

722
00:44:21,760 --> 00:44:23,240
- I ate the paper one time.

723
00:44:23,240 --> 00:44:24,080
- Well, you don't eat the paper,

724
00:44:24,080 --> 00:44:25,800
you put the paper in your mouth to chew it.

725
00:44:25,800 --> 00:44:27,460
I guess with the cupcake wrapper too,

726
00:44:27,460 --> 00:44:29,140
you can put the wrapper in your mouth

727
00:44:29,140 --> 00:44:31,060
to get all the little granules off.

728
00:44:31,060 --> 00:44:33,400
Well, you just chew the wrapper like a Zins.

729
00:44:33,400 --> 00:44:35,240
- Somebody told me in--

730
00:44:35,240 --> 00:44:36,880
- No one cares what I fucking said.

731
00:44:36,880 --> 00:44:39,840
- No, that's what you said was a third grader's opinion.

732
00:44:39,840 --> 00:44:41,840
- I don't know what you said at all.

733
00:44:41,840 --> 00:44:43,400
Put the wrapper in your mouth, chew it like a Zen,

734
00:44:43,400 --> 00:44:45,280
and get all of the cupcake off.

735
00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:47,560
- I knew someone who did that, and I thought it was weird.

736
00:44:47,560 --> 00:44:48,760
- I think that's normal.

737
00:44:48,760 --> 00:44:49,600
- Yeah.

738
00:44:49,600 --> 00:44:50,440
- You spit out the wrapper when you're done.

739
00:44:50,440 --> 00:44:53,100
- Somebody told me that Stride Gum's wrappers

740
00:44:53,100 --> 00:44:54,960
were made out of sugar paper,

741
00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:57,400
and that you should eat the paper on Stride Gum.

742
00:44:57,400 --> 00:44:58,240
- All paper is technically edible.

743
00:44:58,240 --> 00:45:01,040
- You were actually as dumb as a dog growing up.

744
00:45:01,040 --> 00:45:02,120
- No, no, no, this is some,

745
00:45:02,120 --> 00:45:03,440
they told me that they did that

746
00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:04,800
because I asked them why they put

747
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:06,240
the whole thing in their mouth.

748
00:45:06,240 --> 00:45:08,120
- Did you ever do the thing where you take the foil

749
00:45:08,120 --> 00:45:09,800
off of the Five Gum, and then you rub it

750
00:45:09,800 --> 00:45:10,640
with your fingernail on stuff?

751
00:45:10,640 --> 00:45:32,640
and

752
00:45:32,640 --> 00:45:34,240
You know what you could do is get a cat, right?

753
00:45:34,240 --> 00:45:36,180
Put your tinfoil down on the counter.

754
00:45:36,180 --> 00:45:38,500
If you have a problem with the cat jumping up on the counter

755
00:45:38,500 --> 00:45:40,120
all the time while you're cooking,

756
00:45:40,120 --> 00:45:42,840
it hits the tinfoil, scares the shit out of him.

757
00:45:42,840 --> 00:45:44,720
- I'd yell and hit the cat.

758
00:45:44,720 --> 00:45:46,560
- Yeah, why are you wasting your time doing both?

759
00:45:46,560 --> 00:45:48,240
- I wouldn't waste my tinfoil that I could make into a cube.

760
00:45:48,240 --> 00:45:49,520
- You can, yeah, but then you can have

761
00:45:49,520 --> 00:45:51,520
a tinfoil countertop.

762
00:45:51,520 --> 00:45:53,860
- I do that all the time when I make fish.

763
00:45:53,860 --> 00:45:54,700
- Well, buddy.

764
00:45:54,700 --> 00:45:58,760
Buddy, buddy, let me tell you.

765
00:45:58,760 --> 00:45:59,600
- I don't even need a cat for that.

766
00:45:59,600 --> 00:46:01,260
- Oh, you know how when you take the cat

767
00:46:01,260 --> 00:46:02,160
off of the tin foil.

768
00:46:02,160 --> 00:46:08,700
Sorry, when you take the fish off of the cat is stuck in the tin foil. When you

769
00:46:08,700 --> 00:46:10,720
take the fish off the tin foil, a little fish is left behind.

770
00:46:10,720 --> 00:46:14,300
Yeah, yeah, yeah, you put the tin foil in your mouth to get all the fish off

771
00:46:14,300 --> 00:46:18,400
right. When you put the same in on the way for it to connects to it. That's

772
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:20,140
right, you put the tin foil in your mouth, you chew it, you get all the

773
00:46:20,140 --> 00:46:23,580
salmon. What I do is I make it in Papillon. Is it wrong to eat butterfly

774
00:46:23,580 --> 00:46:28,820
style? It's one of the okay things that you can chew on. Is it wrong that you

775
00:46:28,840 --> 00:46:33,480
have you with your body? Yeah, that means you got pica. It means you have a

776
00:46:33,480 --> 00:46:37,480
deficiency of some, but I don't love it, but like I've done right. If you love it,

777
00:46:37,480 --> 00:46:41,320
it's a do you have metal fillings if you're well listen, if you're, if you're

778
00:46:41,320 --> 00:46:44,840
addicted to it, it can be bad, but it's bad if you're addicted to it. It's fine

779
00:46:44,840 --> 00:46:49,160
once in moderation. Okay, number eight, let's go to number eight here before we

780
00:46:49,160 --> 00:46:52,840
have I have metal fillings. At one time, I bit a piece of tin foil and I felt a

781
00:46:52,840 --> 00:46:56,600
surge in my mouth of electricity. That's a lie. That's false. You just had you

782
00:46:56,640 --> 00:47:00,280
just pain. Just told a kevin gate story. You said I had a surge in my mouth of

783
00:47:00,280 --> 00:47:02,080
electricity. I had a surge in my mouth.

784
00:47:02,080 --> 00:47:07,380
Number eight for men, the knowledge of tools

785
00:47:07,380 --> 00:47:12,400
can read instructions and decipher them easily. It is a part of their innate

786
00:47:12,400 --> 00:47:15,460
nature to understand the mechanics of how things work, which is why they have

787
00:47:15,460 --> 00:47:20,460
D I projects at home that women can't do. Women have way more D I y number

788
00:47:20,460 --> 00:47:23,720
eight that's because you are a lazy bastard. I know number eight is

789
00:47:23,760 --> 00:47:28,760
multitasking for when you dare women can reply to tools. Women can reply to

790
00:47:28,760 --> 00:47:33,560
emails on the smartphones cook, watch over the baby and listen to TV news at

791
00:47:33,560 --> 00:47:38,780
the same time men see also best jobs for women. Okay, so here's here's an

792
00:47:38,780 --> 00:47:44,160
obvious example of men having a greater knowledge of tools, tools than men or

793
00:47:44,160 --> 00:47:48,240
women. Rather think about think about how many sex toys men have access to how

794
00:47:48,560 --> 00:47:53,900
many little shapes and sizes and and it's just a whole no because there's the

795
00:47:53,900 --> 00:47:59,340
double sided all men have as a whole. What tool wise for their to have a sex

796
00:47:59,340 --> 00:48:02,500
toy is a whole. I don't think you're saying that men have more sex toys than

797
00:48:02,500 --> 00:48:06,240
women. No, they don't. I think I disagree. Okay, so think about this. I want you

798
00:48:06,240 --> 00:48:09,920
to think about this. Women have different stuff. Think about a flesh,

799
00:48:09,920 --> 00:48:13,140
think about a flesh light. That's the, that's the, you know, the, the, we're,

800
00:48:13,140 --> 00:48:17,760
this is the, the burial ground of, of, of sex toys, right? That's all you need.

801
00:48:17,960 --> 00:48:21,960
That's one hole. Yeah. Then you get the double-sided fleshlight, right?

802
00:48:21,960 --> 00:48:25,760
Two holes. Yeah, then you even have a fleshlight that has a mouth on one side

803
00:48:25,760 --> 00:48:29,260
and a pussy on the other, right? That's still a hole. That's just holes.

804
00:48:29,260 --> 00:48:32,360
Yeah, okay. So I want you to talk to me... You're just describing holes.

805
00:48:32,360 --> 00:48:36,660
Women have... They have a dildo and they have a vibrator. No, but then they...

806
00:48:36,660 --> 00:48:39,560
They have a dildo and they have a vibrator. They also have... They have a dildo

807
00:48:39,560 --> 00:48:43,260
and they have a vibrator. They have two... Those are two things. Those are two operators.

808
00:48:43,260 --> 00:48:47,060
Okay, well there's... Men have different variations on a hole. I'm sorry, but a

809
00:48:47,060 --> 00:48:50,020
Men can also use a dildo on their anus.

810
00:48:50,020 --> 00:48:50,820
But so can a woman.

811
00:48:50,820 --> 00:48:51,860
So women have three--

812
00:48:51,860 --> 00:48:53,020
But that doesn't make it a new dildo.

813
00:48:53,020 --> 00:48:54,380
That doesn't make it a new dildo.

814
00:48:54,380 --> 00:48:55,020
No, no, no, no.

815
00:48:55,020 --> 00:48:57,700
But women have three axes of pleasure.

816
00:48:57,700 --> 00:48:58,300
Men have two.

817
00:48:58,300 --> 00:49:01,220
Because they have the vaginal cavity, the clitoris,

818
00:49:01,220 --> 00:49:02,580
and the ass.

819
00:49:02,580 --> 00:49:03,460
I'm going to own you.

820
00:49:03,460 --> 00:49:04,420
What about a ball clamp?

821
00:49:04,420 --> 00:49:08,380
Has everybody ever developed a sex toy for both that

822
00:49:08,380 --> 00:49:09,620
plays with your nipples?

823
00:49:09,620 --> 00:49:10,700
And women have that, too.

824
00:49:10,700 --> 00:49:11,940
Women have nipples that feel something.

825
00:49:11,940 --> 00:49:13,700
Yeah, men have nipple clamps.

826
00:49:13,700 --> 00:49:14,780
Women have nipple clamps.

827
00:49:14,780 --> 00:49:15,780
But they're not as good.

828
00:49:15,780 --> 00:49:19,580
just use that woman, though, is sitting and watching porn, also with the nipple

829
00:49:19,580 --> 00:49:25,120
clamps only and also women like women like sucking dildos off, too, and got no

830
00:49:25,120 --> 00:49:30,660
guy. I've never seen a guy do that. Guys like fingering flesh lights. Yeah, well,

831
00:49:30,660 --> 00:49:35,460
but again, again, all male sex toys are variations on a whole just get buying a

832
00:49:35,460 --> 00:49:40,260
flesh like or look at or even then, even then, fuck they're using a different

833
00:49:40,260 --> 00:49:44,180
eye. Get men don't always just need a whole. I feel like you know a body pillow

834
00:49:44,200 --> 00:49:47,100
isn't a hole. It's just an in body pillows going to have a hole in it.

835
00:49:47,100 --> 00:49:49,600
Eventually, I don't think you know how a body

836
00:49:49,600 --> 00:49:55,900
into the stitching buddy. That's a sex toy. It can be if you put a hole in

837
00:49:55,900 --> 00:50:00,620
okay. So this is the perfect talk about my new favorite video. Have you guys

838
00:50:00,620 --> 00:50:03,820
all watch this video yet? The washing the guy fucking the washers. I watch

839
00:50:03,820 --> 00:50:06,960
this video about a thousand times. Everybody should go up. We have to watch

840
00:50:06,960 --> 00:50:09,940
it and by the way, a man can use a vibrator. A man can use a vibrator, a

841
00:50:09,960 --> 00:50:13,600
wild on what appears man can use anything a woman can use plus here's

842
00:50:13,600 --> 00:50:17,460
Pierce you're getting you're getting hung up on this. You say we're going to

843
00:50:17,460 --> 00:50:17,800
go on

844
00:50:17,800 --> 00:50:24,640
a right. We're going to go on x dot com and we're going. What are you doing?

845
00:50:24,640 --> 00:50:27,080
That's a pretty good try.

846
00:50:27,080 --> 00:50:32,960
That's a pretty good try. It's going to go on x right now. We're going to watch

847
00:50:32,960 --> 00:50:36,160
a video of a guy fucking a washing machine and we're going to listen to the

848
00:50:36,160 --> 00:50:37,200
sound of the video.

849
00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:44,880
Do you have it on your Twitter on your X? You have to put an under you have to put

850
00:50:44,880 --> 00:50:48,440
the underscore. Why don't you just go on X? Oh, there it is.

851
00:50:48,440 --> 00:50:53,460
Okay, now play this video. Oh yeah, you're barely allowed to look at Twitter

852
00:50:53,460 --> 00:50:58,080
X. Now, what the hell if you're not logged in, if you're not logged in memes,

853
00:50:58,080 --> 00:51:01,120
I've made in the past look and it even has all three of the

854
00:51:01,120 --> 00:51:06,240
Twitter. I have associated on the side. I have my fucking hottest memes going.

855
00:51:06,320 --> 00:51:11,320
Look at that. You might like the three accounts associated with the show.

856
00:51:11,320 --> 00:51:13,320
I'll just play this video. Just play it into the audio machine.

857
00:51:13,320 --> 00:51:15,320
Yeah, put it on the GoPro. That's good.

858
00:51:15,320 --> 00:51:17,320
And it's dark.

859
00:51:17,320 --> 00:51:18,320
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

860
00:51:18,320 --> 00:51:19,320
- Did you spit in it, Buzz?

861
00:51:19,320 --> 00:51:19,820
- A lot.

862
00:51:19,820 --> 00:51:21,320
[LAUGHTER]

863
00:51:21,320 --> 00:51:22,320
- What was about?

864
00:51:22,320 --> 00:51:23,320
- Mama.

865
00:51:23,320 --> 00:51:25,320
- Well, what the fuck is you in here doing?

866
00:51:25,320 --> 00:51:28,320
- Washing my clothes, Mama.

867
00:51:28,320 --> 00:51:29,320
- Washing your clothes?

868
00:51:29,320 --> 00:51:30,820
- You know what I was doing.

869
00:51:30,820 --> 00:51:33,320
I was washing my clothes.

870
00:51:33,320 --> 00:51:35,820
- Looks to me like you was trying to get your dick wetter

871
00:51:35,820 --> 00:51:36,820
than your clothes.

872
00:51:36,820 --> 00:51:38,820
- Mama, not today, all right?

873
00:51:38,820 --> 00:51:41,820
Don't do that to me right now, all right?

874
00:51:41,820 --> 00:51:43,320
[LAUGHTER]

875
00:51:43,320 --> 00:51:44,820
- Well, did you put on some aluminum foil

876
00:51:44,820 --> 00:51:46,320
you know,

877
00:51:46,320 --> 00:51:56,340
Mama Mama not not today day do this to be right

878
00:51:56,340 --> 00:52:01,760
when he says you know what I was doing washing my

879
00:52:01,760 --> 00:52:05,220
funny is

880
00:52:05,220 --> 00:52:09,300
he's got a condom hanging out of his but

881
00:52:09,300 --> 00:52:12,060
why did you put a condom in your? I don't know

882
00:52:12,900 --> 00:52:14,420
that way you don't have to clean the dildo

883
00:52:14,420 --> 00:52:19,100
dryer. There is not even like you have to clean a dildo. It's just going back

884
00:52:19,100 --> 00:52:20,660
to your ass putting anything

885
00:52:20,660 --> 00:52:26,780
who cares about shit on it's going back. That is the funniest video. He's not

886
00:52:26,780 --> 00:52:32,620
even like humping the crack of the the wash. I think any any actor in the

887
00:52:32,620 --> 00:52:38,900
world is jealous of that line rate of not today. Mama don't do this to me

888
00:52:38,940 --> 00:52:44,300
right now. He's just hunching over to hide his boner. I think he is doing.

889
00:52:44,300 --> 00:52:47,980
I think it's completely fake. I think it's also a bad mom. I think it's a

890
00:52:47,980 --> 00:52:51,240
fake video. It's definitely the most horrible thing of all time. If it's

891
00:52:51,240 --> 00:52:54,960
really definitely a bad peer abuse. I think the thing that makes me think it's

892
00:52:54,960 --> 00:52:58,720
so abused that he thinks a washer dryer is a sexual. The thing that makes me

893
00:52:58,720 --> 00:53:03,600
think it's fake is there's no possible way to derive any sexual pleasure at all

894
00:53:03,600 --> 00:53:07,640
from fucking that dryer. He is rubbing his dick against the hard metal corner.

895
00:53:07,660 --> 00:53:11,560
hold on now the way he's doing it. You watch that video again. You tell me

896
00:53:11,560 --> 00:53:11,980
that doesn't

897
00:53:11,980 --> 00:53:14,080
painful

898
00:53:14,080 --> 00:53:18,740
good ever. She had some people that makes me think is fake is that her lines

899
00:53:18,740 --> 00:53:22,000
are too good. Yeah, they're too funny. Yeah, he might be a seno bite

900
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:23,800
could be

901
00:53:23,800 --> 00:53:29,980
maybe he's been so abused that he likes pain. He exactly he's a seno bite

902
00:53:29,980 --> 00:53:34,660
pleasure. He's number seven for men is manner solution oriented men tend to

903
00:53:34,700 --> 00:53:37,460
move towards the solution of the problem. Instead of spending three hours

904
00:53:37,460 --> 00:53:40,940
crying, seven days worrying and three weeks talking about it to friends,

905
00:53:40,940 --> 00:53:43,960
parents and other people around them, there might immediately comes up with

906
00:53:43,960 --> 00:53:46,560
twelve solutions without thinking that it might be an insult to how they're

907
00:53:46,560 --> 00:53:49,320
feeling right now. Twelve solutions seems like a waste of energy, but yeah

908
00:53:49,320 --> 00:53:53,480
yeah that is a brain or seven female brain has better healing ability. Let's

909
00:53:53,480 --> 00:53:57,800
say if both a man and woman met an accident at the same time, a woman would

910
00:53:57,800 --> 00:54:01,900
be up doing her daily tasks even before the man opens his eyes. That is because

911
00:54:01,940 --> 00:54:05,620
the females neurons are inter linked, while the brain of a man is

912
00:54:05,620 --> 00:54:07,080
compartmentalized wow

913
00:54:07,080 --> 00:54:14,040
yeah. I like that again. This is DPS versus ten yeah, yeah, healing abilities.

914
00:54:14,040 --> 00:54:17,880
I'm actually I'm actually thinking that this could be a whole. These are kind of

915
00:54:17,880 --> 00:54:23,480
both. This is DPS versus tank because the healing ability that's sandwich yeah,

916
00:54:23,480 --> 00:54:29,200
and then this is ADC and support yeah easy. Why is the woman on the table

917
00:54:29,280 --> 00:54:34,480
sexual style that speaks to what we're about to get into. I imagine as we get

918
00:54:34,480 --> 00:54:38,840
into the top five number six less complicated relationships for men,

919
00:54:38,840 --> 00:54:42,480
because men don't give a damn about what others think of them. They don't worry

920
00:54:42,480 --> 00:54:46,560
about what they think of others either. A group of male friends can go out every

921
00:54:46,560 --> 00:54:50,640
weekend without worrying what the other person was wearing. This cool attitude

922
00:54:50,640 --> 00:54:54,720
comes naturally and makes things less complicating, including fashion

923
00:54:55,240 --> 00:54:59,400
communication experts for women. Women can talk to anyone anywhere. They know

924
00:54:59,400 --> 00:55:02,800
how to socialize with the bus driver, the teacher of their kids, the cleaner,

925
00:55:02,800 --> 00:55:06,880
the sales person or anyone sitting with them in the bus advances in human life

926
00:55:06,880 --> 00:55:11,740
are because of communication and we owe that to women. I think

927
00:55:11,740 --> 00:55:18,200
I mean this is a perfect example of men having not complicated. I look at us

928
00:55:18,200 --> 00:55:21,400
three and there's a guy who just went to the bathroom and we're touching each

929
00:55:21,400 --> 00:55:24,800
other. We just go to the bathroom all the time. We should start going to the

930
00:55:24,840 --> 00:55:29,760
bathroom together like girls. I does that shit make you jealous or what when

931
00:55:29,760 --> 00:55:34,000
they say we're us ten are going to go to the bathroom and I say can I never

932
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:38,560
mind. I would say that you guys and I are maybe like you know two months out

933
00:55:38,560 --> 00:55:43,360
of me asking to piss in the sink with you while you guys use the toilet. I

934
00:55:43,360 --> 00:55:46,840
mean I like doing that when it's like you think that we could reach the point

935
00:55:46,840 --> 00:55:50,800
of penis from penis friends. This is a probably cross. So I guess I'm not

936
00:55:50,800 --> 00:55:53,480
gonna. We're definitely penis friends. It just haven't hasn't happened with him.

937
00:55:53,520 --> 00:55:57,900
I think that the central tension of our friendship for years on end is that we

938
00:55:57,900 --> 00:56:02,040
are on the precipice for a penis friends. I don't think so. I think we're

939
00:56:02,040 --> 00:56:05,460
basically everybody's been a friend all but we're all but penis friends.

940
00:56:05,460 --> 00:56:08,640
Everybody's seen my penis. I haven't seen your head really, and I but I

941
00:56:08,640 --> 00:56:11,600
imagine that your penis looks identical. I think you never showed it to me

942
00:56:11,600 --> 00:56:14,340
because you're afraid I'd like it too much. It definitely

943
00:56:14,340 --> 00:56:18,000
just takes you a Caleb just thinking about

944
00:56:21,200 --> 00:56:25,800
talking about how we have a lack in our house because okay, all your friends

945
00:56:25,800 --> 00:56:27,540
from back home have seen your penis yeah, no

946
00:56:27,540 --> 00:56:31,900
okay, so you should go back home figure that out and come back and join us,

947
00:56:31,900 --> 00:56:36,320
but I've seen your penis yeah, and you guys have all seen my penis. I don't

948
00:56:36,320 --> 00:56:39,240
know if you have that's what we were saying is Pierce might be the only one

949
00:56:39,240 --> 00:56:42,540
where we haven't seen his penis and he hasn't seen ours. I don't think anyone

950
00:56:42,540 --> 00:56:47,200
seen my and pat have seen each other's penises. Why double digit time because

951
00:56:47,220 --> 00:56:52,020
they were the most just like you guys show stuff showers. It's funny. You guys

952
00:56:52,020 --> 00:56:57,380
like to show it's funny to it's funny to show your male friend your penis. I

953
00:56:57,380 --> 00:57:02,540
it's not funny to show a person you don't know your penis. It's also not

954
00:57:02,540 --> 00:57:07,140
funny to show that you like now you're not who you like, but if somebody

955
00:57:07,140 --> 00:57:11,260
doesn't know you at all, and they see your that's a little bit. That's the

956
00:57:11,260 --> 00:57:13,220
most romantic thing though yeah.

957
00:57:14,220 --> 00:57:19,680
that is romantic. That is like showing someone a candle down girl. I'm going

958
00:57:19,680 --> 00:57:21,200
to show it to you. I'm going to show you it

959
00:57:21,200 --> 00:57:25,040
open your eyes girl

960
00:57:25,040 --> 00:57:26,980
look.

961
00:57:26,980 --> 00:57:28,000
It does

962
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:35,820
there it is baby. What do women think of penises? I look at my penis and every

963
00:57:35,820 --> 00:57:39,660
time I see my own penis in the mirror. I feel like a woman who's being subject

964
00:57:42,820 --> 00:57:49,220
Oh, my God, I don't want to see mine. Oh, my God, I know that mine's nothing

965
00:57:49,220 --> 00:57:53,340
special. I'm tiny. I'm a tiny man. I got these little wrists. I got a tiny

966
00:57:53,340 --> 00:57:56,180
head. I got a big belly and I do just have the

967
00:57:56,180 --> 00:58:00,100
penis of a normal human being. I look like, you know, that picture of that

968
00:58:00,100 --> 00:58:04,260
orangutan. A normal, that's what I have too. Is that the normal size? Is that

969
00:58:04,260 --> 00:58:07,700
the monkey that I'm thinking of? The orange monkey that's got a big gut and

970
00:58:07,700 --> 00:58:11,180
his dick's out? You know that one? Yeah, that's an orangutan. Are you talking

971
00:58:11,180 --> 00:58:13,280
know when he fucks a woman's hand? No, no, no,

972
00:58:13,280 --> 00:58:18,220
I'm talking about that photo of just like the monkey standing. Oh, he's

973
00:58:18,220 --> 00:58:18,260
always

974
00:58:18,260 --> 00:58:23,020
he's not peeing, but he's just got his dick out. Well, I've seen all types of

975
00:58:23,020 --> 00:58:26,460
monkeys penises in every possible context, so I'm sorry that I kind of

976
00:58:26,460 --> 00:58:31,100
there's a very famous image of an orangutan standing in a field. I know

977
00:58:31,100 --> 00:58:31,820
which one you're talking about.

978
00:58:31,820 --> 00:58:36,460
He's just bragging about how many images of monkey penises he's seen. I'm not

979
00:58:36,460 --> 00:58:39,260
bragging, it's honestly a curse on my personal life. You're bragging, you're

980
00:58:39,300 --> 00:58:43,080
I get into a lot of trouble with a lot of people over how many different photos I

981
00:58:43,080 --> 00:58:44,580
try to bring up and videos of

982
00:58:44,580 --> 00:58:46,060
and monkeys.

983
00:58:46,060 --> 00:58:51,500
Humble brag, I watch videos of monkeys, fucking humans.

984
00:58:51,500 --> 00:58:58,500
The appeal and opposite gender is visual, while many men will not admit

985
00:58:58,500 --> 00:59:02,000
that their attraction to the opposite gender is based on the looks of most of

986
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:06,060
the times. If they will just look at the person and decide whether they want to

987
00:59:06,100 --> 00:59:10,100
hate her or not. Women, on the other hand, will be unsure of this even after three years

988
00:59:10,100 --> 00:59:15,100
of knowing the person because they tend to find marriage material in each guy.

989
00:59:15,100 --> 00:59:17,100
Women like every guy is what it's saying here, I guess.

990
00:59:17,100 --> 00:59:19,100
And on the other side, women can get things done.

991
00:59:19,100 --> 00:59:24,100
Well, wait, that's the thing for men is that that's a positive for men they're saying.

992
00:59:24,100 --> 00:59:26,100
Yeah, that's good.

993
00:59:26,100 --> 00:59:32,100
Every single positive that they list for men just makes men sound like the most manipulative

994
00:59:32,100 --> 00:59:33,100
people in the world.

995
00:59:33,100 --> 00:59:35,140
This is like the best thing about being a man.

996
00:59:35,140 --> 00:59:36,140
Welcome to Earth.

997
00:59:36,140 --> 00:59:37,140
Welcome to Earth.

998
00:59:37,140 --> 00:59:41,100
Maybe it's different on Mars or Venus, but here we have a system that I don't like very

999
00:59:41,100 --> 00:59:42,100
much.

1000
00:59:42,100 --> 00:59:43,100
Yeah.

1001
00:59:43,100 --> 00:59:44,100
It sounds very patriarchal.

1002
00:59:44,100 --> 00:59:45,100
Yeah.

1003
00:59:45,100 --> 00:59:47,100
Yeah, where's the thing about men being warriors?

1004
00:59:47,100 --> 00:59:48,100
Yeah.

1005
00:59:48,100 --> 00:59:49,100
Well, that was tools.

1006
00:59:49,100 --> 00:59:51,700
Well, look at them in the back.

1007
00:59:51,700 --> 00:59:52,700
They have an army.

1008
00:59:52,700 --> 00:59:55,820
If men don't find anything interesting, they will not do it.

1009
00:59:55,820 --> 01:00:00,140
Likewise, they will not do anything, again, if they aren't encouraged and appreciated

1010
01:00:00,140 --> 01:00:03,780
the first time, even if it is something like washing dishes. Women, on the other

1011
01:00:03,780 --> 01:00:06,500
hand, will get things done when they have to. I do not fuck with the dishes.

1012
01:00:06,500 --> 01:00:10,580
Dude, I fuck with the dishes. I love the dishes. My wife takes three days to do

1013
01:00:10,580 --> 01:00:16,500
four dishes. I know. I have a one day, other day switch off situation. Each day,

1014
01:00:16,500 --> 01:00:21,260
other day. I love it. I'll do them all the time. I walk up to the dishes and my

1015
01:00:21,260 --> 01:00:24,860
girlfriend will say, "I'll do them. I'll do the dishes." I listen to music. I get

1016
01:00:24,860 --> 01:00:28,020
my cue right. I shuffle my playlists with all my songs. I take out the songs I

1017
01:00:28,020 --> 01:00:35,220
I don't want. Wow. What I do is if I cook. I was talking. Sorry Pierce.

1018
01:00:35,220 --> 01:00:39,220
Everybody clear the air. I was talking. I was complaining about my woman.

1019
01:00:39,220 --> 01:00:44,620
It's time to eat. Thank you. So I was about to you know do the dishes let's

1020
01:00:44,620 --> 01:00:48,820
say and my girlfriend says no I'll do them. She goes up to the sink. She puts

1021
01:00:48,820 --> 01:00:53,820
on the rubber gloves as if that's even necessary. I always cringe when ladies

1022
01:00:53,820 --> 01:00:57,320
put on the rubber gloves. You don't need that. And then she says okay I'm gonna

1023
01:00:57,320 --> 01:01:01,160
start washing and then she turns on the water and then the dishes that are dry

1024
01:01:01,160 --> 01:01:03,480
that are sitting on the drying rack, she doesn't-,

1025
01:01:03,480 --> 01:01:08,840
she doesn't move the dishes from the drying rack back to where the dishes

1026
01:01:08,840 --> 01:01:11,760
live, and I'm like, 'That means you're only gonna be able to wash three,' and

1027
01:01:11,760 --> 01:01:15,240
she says, 'I only feel like washing three, so that's perfect.' You wash them

1028
01:01:15,240 --> 01:01:17,360
all every time. When you wash them, you wash them all. You have to wash them

1029
01:01:17,360 --> 01:01:20,840
all. It's gotta be empty. It's gotta be empty. Just clear the-, clear the dry

1030
01:01:20,840 --> 01:01:25,320
dishes. And then listen, you scrub the sink down. Yeah. Oh, that I actually

1031
01:01:25,320 --> 01:01:26,540
- I don't agree with that.

1032
01:01:26,540 --> 01:01:28,280
- That I actually don't agree with.

1033
01:01:28,280 --> 01:01:29,120
- Well, how could you not agree with that?

1034
01:01:29,120 --> 01:01:30,080
- My chicken's washing in there.

1035
01:01:30,080 --> 01:01:30,920
- Why would you not agree with scrubbing the sink?

1036
01:01:30,920 --> 01:01:32,760
- I'm washing my chicken in the sink already.

1037
01:01:32,760 --> 01:01:33,600
- 'Cause it's a sink, it's gonna be dirty.

1038
01:01:33,600 --> 01:01:34,440
- But I scrub it.

1039
01:01:34,440 --> 01:01:35,280
- It's already dirty.

1040
01:01:35,280 --> 01:01:36,840
- Why not have it clean?

1041
01:01:36,840 --> 01:01:37,680
- That's crazy.

1042
01:01:37,680 --> 01:01:39,720
- The dishes are what you're supposed to make and clean.

1043
01:01:39,720 --> 01:01:41,000
- You clean the sink.

1044
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:41,840
- The sink will smell.

1045
01:01:41,840 --> 01:01:43,320
- Why not, it takes it one second.

1046
01:01:43,320 --> 01:01:45,000
- When the sink smells, you can clean it,

1047
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:45,840
but it's not gonna stay dirty.

1048
01:01:45,840 --> 01:01:48,000
- You clean it when it smells.

1049
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:48,840
- No.

1050
01:01:48,840 --> 01:01:49,680
- You clean it every time that you think about doing it.

1051
01:01:49,680 --> 01:01:52,480
think about this is a all right. I think what you have is a system where you do

1052
01:01:52,480 --> 01:01:55,860
the dishes every other night with your significant other and you know that

1053
01:01:55,860 --> 01:01:58,300
you're the one who likes washing the sink and the other person is the one who

1054
01:01:58,300 --> 01:02:00,240
doesn't. So you know the sink gets cleaned every other day. I would love to

1055
01:02:00,240 --> 01:02:04,340
wash the sink, but the dishes I don't like. Right, so you can't wash the sink

1056
01:02:04,340 --> 01:02:08,220
if you don't do the dishes. Number four, programming electronics. That's men's.

1057
01:02:08,220 --> 01:02:12,500
Men and boys could program their VCRs and tape recorders in the 1970s when

1058
01:02:12,500 --> 01:02:16,740
something went wrong. The same applies to gadgets and electronic devices in

1059
01:02:16,780 --> 01:02:20,800
today's time. Apparently, these skills are in born and just magically appear in

1060
01:02:20,800 --> 01:02:25,880
every generation born and then what is that? Look at the TV. They're watching

1061
01:02:25,880 --> 01:02:26,980
one of my favorite shows.

1062
01:02:26,980 --> 01:02:32,820
Number four is women have super powers that get things done. The utility boy

1063
01:02:32,820 --> 01:02:36,780
will leave the power on the policeman will let the woman off without charging

1064
01:02:36,780 --> 01:02:40,900
a ticket and she will get her way around any problem. The super power is tears.

1065
01:02:40,900 --> 01:02:46,000
The super power is using sex. It's sexuality and showing the boobs, showing

1066
01:02:46,020 --> 01:02:49,780
showing the boobs through the closing. I will say that tears hit different when

1067
01:02:49,780 --> 01:02:50,900
she got boobs.

1068
01:02:50,900 --> 01:02:52,500
True.

1069
01:02:52,500 --> 01:02:57,700
That's real shit. Stop going ahead. I'll say next when I want it. We're gonna

1070
01:02:57,700 --> 01:03:00,540
talk about both of these for ten more minutes. No, I don't wanna talk about

1071
01:03:00,540 --> 01:03:02,020
these. Okay, let's go to number three.

1072
01:03:02,020 --> 01:03:06,900
For men, less time getting ready to go out. I know that's real. That's some

1073
01:03:06,900 --> 01:03:09,940
pastry Garfield right there. That's real as fuck. That is one point that we

1074
01:03:09,940 --> 01:03:14,060
would definitely give them points on. They don't need makeup, hair styling,

1075
01:03:14,100 --> 01:03:18,860
and they don't need hours to decide what to wear. Honestly, who notices for

1076
01:03:18,860 --> 01:03:23,380
women detail oriented women can categorize things like task lists,

1077
01:03:23,380 --> 01:03:27,600
birthdays, shopping lists, assignments and whole calendars in their brains,

1078
01:03:27,600 --> 01:03:31,040
while remembering smaller details like what their boyfriend likes for dinners

1079
01:03:31,040 --> 01:03:34,420
and other basic facts that is downright impossible for men.

1080
01:03:34,420 --> 01:03:39,460
Yeah, I take basically one second to go out and I just go on to my undies.

1081
01:03:39,500 --> 01:03:44,500
that's the the big division with my my wife is that I am early to everything

1082
01:03:44,500 --> 01:03:47,100
and she is late to everything. You're not early to everything. I'm really

1083
01:03:47,100 --> 01:03:51,060
everything you're early to everything important right yeah yeah everything

1084
01:03:51,060 --> 01:03:54,060
that doesn't involve me and Patrick. Well, that's because your time is not

1085
01:03:54,060 --> 01:03:57,580
valued by me and your shirt says mad balls. You left the house wearing that

1086
01:03:57,580 --> 01:04:01,780
shit. Get this guys. This is my wife's shirt and she wouldn't let me wear it

1087
01:04:01,780 --> 01:04:06,620
for months because she was like I like that shirt so much. Your wife likes mad

1088
01:04:06,660 --> 01:04:10,100
balls. It says ball. That's what I was thinking. I was like, why are you so

1089
01:04:10,100 --> 01:04:13,900
mad balls? Why are you so protective of this balls? You're in your PJs right now

1090
01:04:13,900 --> 01:04:17,700
to be honest. You are in my girlfriend's clothes. What a t shirt. What are you in

1091
01:04:17,700 --> 01:04:21,580
your girlfriend's clothes? You're in PJs. How am I in PJs? It's a PJs. That's

1092
01:04:21,580 --> 01:04:22,980
crazy. A t shirt. Yeah,

1093
01:04:22,980 --> 01:04:27,820
we're having two separate things. Yeah, moving on fits in his girlfriend's

1094
01:04:27,820 --> 01:04:30,500
clothes is what he said. Well, her shirts. I don't wear her. I can fit in

1095
01:04:30,500 --> 01:04:33,860
my girlfriend's clothes. If I'd reconstitute them and rip them apart and

1096
01:04:33,900 --> 01:04:37,900
- I get mad at him if I read. - If I put on one of my girlfriend's shirts,

1097
01:04:37,900 --> 01:04:39,580
it would rip almost instantly.

1098
01:04:39,580 --> 01:04:42,380
- Strength. - My girlfriend is so much smaller than me.

1099
01:04:42,380 --> 01:04:44,780
- Superman, stop man, you're kind of freaking me out.

1100
01:04:44,780 --> 01:04:48,860
- There is something so sexual about a man bursting out of his clothes.

1101
01:04:48,860 --> 01:04:49,700
Don't you guys think?

1102
01:04:49,700 --> 01:04:52,700
- I do want to ask her if there's anything she's getting rid of so that I

1103
01:04:52,700 --> 01:04:56,380
can put it on just to do this and just feel strong for once in my life, like Hulk.

1104
01:04:56,380 --> 01:04:59,380
- How bad would you feel if you tried to do that and you just hurt your arms?

1105
01:04:59,380 --> 01:05:01,820
(laughter)

1106
01:05:01,820 --> 01:05:06,580
maybe get it in front of her. Oh, you're throwing this out. Watch this. I'm

1107
01:05:06,580 --> 01:05:10,820
just doing that doing that, but then I like I'm not going to admit that I hurt

1108
01:05:10,820 --> 01:05:14,300
my arms. One second, one second, just unattractive to women when you throw

1109
01:05:14,300 --> 01:05:15,420
your back out. Yes,

1110
01:05:15,420 --> 01:05:20,900
and if you hurt yourself, that sucks. If you ever stub your toe, this is what

1111
01:05:20,900 --> 01:05:22,860
you should do. You say I didn't still my tell

1112
01:05:22,860 --> 01:05:30,620
number two. Wait, can I just ask your friends real quick lady fans? What is

1113
01:05:30,660 --> 01:05:35,300
more attractive when a man peels off his shirt like this and then kind of drops

1114
01:05:35,300 --> 01:05:39,580
it and then you know he just did that gaily yeah right okay. Well, so

1115
01:05:39,580 --> 01:05:40,740
someone did that right.

1116
01:05:40,740 --> 01:05:43,220
Someone did that straightly

1117
01:05:43,220 --> 01:05:48,980
when he feels like a shirt or just pop out of

1118
01:05:48,980 --> 01:05:57,540
do you mean rip out of it or you mean pop out of it as a different thing.

1119
01:05:57,740 --> 01:06:01,220
like you go like this, you go like this and then you're next to all your

1120
01:06:01,220 --> 01:06:05,160
clothes falling in a pile next to you. You get raptured out of your clothes.

1121
01:06:05,160 --> 01:06:07,460
You're a night crawler bamfed out of your clothes.

1122
01:06:07,460 --> 01:06:12,140
Like you have clothes that are on you with suction cups. No, like there's a

1123
01:06:12,140 --> 01:06:15,460
tear and you flex your bicep and then your bicep pops out of that. I don't

1124
01:06:15,460 --> 01:06:20,100
think a single person has ever done that. That necessitates having a very

1125
01:06:20,100 --> 01:06:22,940
tiny shirt on for anybody. Right, well that's what I mean.

1126
01:06:23,940 --> 01:06:27,960
What is it more sexy? Okay, you peel off a tiny question. If you're a woman,

1127
01:06:27,960 --> 01:06:31,360
leave a comment down below, address it to pierce a dear pierce

1128
01:06:31,360 --> 01:06:36,120
right. What you think is sexy about a boy taking off his shirt or whatever,

1129
01:06:36,120 --> 01:06:37,060
however way

1130
01:06:37,060 --> 01:06:44,020
pops out the question. The question is so your question is women. Do you think

1131
01:06:44,020 --> 01:06:46,320
it's sexier when a man takes off his shirt

1132
01:06:46,320 --> 01:06:48,800
is close?

1133
01:06:48,800 --> 01:06:50,680
Do you think

1134
01:06:50,680 --> 01:06:51,720
a man

1135
01:06:53,360 --> 01:06:57,960
we can boil this down. His shirt off women. Do you like it when a man pops

1136
01:06:57,960 --> 01:07:03,720
out pops out or do you like it? I'm a man out at you or slides slides or pops.

1137
01:07:03,720 --> 01:07:07,400
Do you like it when a man slides on you sliding or sliding or pop dear pierce?

1138
01:07:07,400 --> 01:07:11,160
I like sliding dear pierce. I like pop. This is a new column. This is a new

1139
01:07:11,160 --> 01:07:16,240
column for the show. Dear pierce, because all men all men have this relationship.

1140
01:07:16,240 --> 01:07:19,920
My boyfriend has been taking his shirt. He's been sliding.

1141
01:07:22,160 --> 01:07:26,460
how do I get him to pop? All men have the sliding and popping dynamic that they do

1142
01:07:26,460 --> 01:07:30,220
in their daily lives right you're sliding until you meet the right person

1143
01:07:30,220 --> 01:07:34,960
and then you pop all over. I can pop a shoe off. Oh, I've cut my shoe off for

1144
01:07:34,960 --> 01:07:39,140
sure yeah, yeah, so I can put my slide. They slide each lace together in a

1145
01:07:39,140 --> 01:07:44,940
delicate knot. I just pop them on right my shoe laces yeah, okay number two

1146
01:07:44,940 --> 01:07:51,820
for men making babies is easy for them for men. The whole process of becoming a

1147
01:07:51,860 --> 01:07:55,500
father involves three minutes of their time three minutes on the other hand

1148
01:07:55,500 --> 01:07:59,980
that's a bit that's a is the ladies who have to face nine months of trouble for

1149
01:07:59,980 --> 01:08:03,260
the baby to come into this world. So making babies is easier for men versus

1150
01:08:03,260 --> 01:08:08,020
let's compare these two for women. Women live longer. Women are stronger than

1151
01:08:08,020 --> 01:08:12,020
men when it comes to nerves, which is probably why they live on average a year

1152
01:08:12,020 --> 01:08:16,220
a whole year longer than men. Women are also better decision makers regarding

1153
01:08:16,220 --> 01:08:19,820
their diet duties. Here's the problem I have at this women don't understand that

1154
01:08:19,940 --> 01:08:23,400
men, the difference between how men experience time and a women experience

1155
01:08:23,400 --> 01:08:29,000
time is like us and like mosquitoes three minutes to us having sex trying to

1156
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:33,740
think of our grandma. So we don't come is so much longer than nine months to a

1157
01:08:33,740 --> 01:08:37,580
woman right yeah and here's here's what I'd like to introduce here to if we were

1158
01:08:37,580 --> 01:08:41,580
comparing these two. So sure women live a year longer, but about

1159
01:08:41,580 --> 01:08:46,420
ninety months of their life are going to be taken up by being pregnant yeah yeah,

1160
01:08:46,580 --> 01:08:50,400
so you're actually losing them yeah exactly you're losing like a by the

1161
01:08:50,400 --> 01:08:55,120
way, if you're pregnant, you might as well not even be a lot. Why do we count

1162
01:08:55,120 --> 01:08:59,780
that yeah pregnant? It should be in a birthday. I agree. You shouldn't have a

1163
01:08:59,780 --> 01:09:03,060
birthday. You should know wait. It's sharing a life with someone else

1164
01:09:03,060 --> 01:09:07,120
literally, so it should just be halved well and you just can't do anything. Oh

1165
01:09:07,120 --> 01:09:09,500
my God, except eat pickles,

1166
01:09:09,500 --> 01:09:15,460
pick up and tuna fish. Pregnant women literally will skip roller coaster rides

1167
01:09:15,500 --> 01:09:20,540
pickles. What the hell's wrong with them? I know. You know what my mom used to do when

1168
01:09:20,540 --> 01:09:28,540
she was pregnant with me? My mom was pregnant with me. Allegedly. She would get mayo and

1169
01:09:28,540 --> 01:09:34,700
pickles on Italian meatball subs. Why do they like pickles so much? The pregnancy craving

1170
01:09:34,700 --> 01:09:41,980
that she had was marinara sauce, meatball, mayo, pickles, and she still orders it to

1171
01:09:41,980 --> 01:09:46,020
to this day and it's the most disgusting thing I've ever seen. I was pregnant.

1172
01:09:46,020 --> 01:09:49,020
It's different when it's not coming through the amniotic sack. I was

1173
01:09:49,020 --> 01:09:54,020
pregnant. I know that my simple ass would be craving PB and J yeah every

1174
01:09:54,020 --> 01:09:57,260
single do you guys ever read the stuff that Elvis ate and maybe he was

1175
01:09:57,260 --> 01:10:01,420
pregnant. Elvis was pregnant. That's why he ate a fool's gold sandwich. He would

1176
01:10:01,420 --> 01:10:04,760
eat bacon and peanut butter. Yeah, which that's really good. If you've never had

1177
01:10:04,760 --> 01:10:09,040
it made me have that that's really good. It's really, really Elvis. My mom made

1178
01:10:09,060 --> 01:10:12,560
we have that, and I like you always put chocolate on it too, but no okay, no

1179
01:10:12,560 --> 01:10:16,460
the thing that was fucked up that he did was he like it was like a hollowed out

1180
01:10:16,460 --> 01:10:21,420
he ate some messed up. It was a whole a whole loaf of bread covered in bacon and

1181
01:10:21,420 --> 01:10:26,340
peanut butter. He stole a fourteen year old girl from her parents really and all

1182
01:10:26,340 --> 01:10:26,820
of black,

1183
01:10:26,820 --> 01:10:32,260
Priscilla, yeah, apparently that hasn't been proven yet. Okay, so

1184
01:10:32,260 --> 01:10:37,660
we're going to move to the final entry on this list number one for men. Men are

1185
01:10:37,820 --> 01:10:42,220
not social chameleon. A woman can change herself according to any gathering

1186
01:10:42,220 --> 01:10:46,220
within a few seconds, like a cult. Men are somewhat consistent and persistent

1187
01:10:46,220 --> 01:10:49,480
in their opinions and feelings regarding anything, and for women number one

1188
01:10:49,480 --> 01:10:53,940
psychic powers. Not only can women tell why their baby is crying, they can also

1189
01:10:53,940 --> 01:10:57,460
be absolutely sure if their husband is cheating or their friend is having a

1190
01:10:57,460 --> 01:11:01,420
problem. She will already have figured you out, so there is no point to lying

1191
01:11:01,420 --> 01:11:05,740
about it. A woman has strong intuition. A husband is cheating is in blue, so

1192
01:11:05,780 --> 01:11:07,460
There's a bunch of links here.

1193
01:11:07,460 --> 01:11:12,860
Is there like a thing for top ten ways to find out if a husband is cheating?

1194
01:11:12,860 --> 01:11:13,860
Probably.

1195
01:11:13,860 --> 01:11:14,860
I don't know.

1196
01:11:14,860 --> 01:11:15,860
Oh my god.

1197
01:11:15,860 --> 01:11:16,860
There's a bunch of stuff on this website.

1198
01:11:16,860 --> 01:11:18,460
I'm going to look at that and apply it to my own life.

1199
01:11:18,460 --> 01:11:23,700
We'll go back to saying funny stuff immediately, but I just want listeners to know, look, this

1200
01:11:23,700 --> 01:11:25,780
website is hetero.

1201
01:11:25,780 --> 01:11:28,380
It's not trans positive, this website.

1202
01:11:28,380 --> 01:11:32,740
This list, it's very cis-promotive, you know?

1203
01:11:32,740 --> 01:11:37,880
Plus, it's also like I'm totally a social chameleon. Yeah, right. I am a

1204
01:11:37,880 --> 01:11:41,100
woman. No, it makes me a psychopath. Yes, no,

1205
01:11:41,100 --> 01:11:47,180
I like girls put makeup on me and I just want I just want the women of the

1206
01:11:47,180 --> 01:11:50,220
world to know that your motherness does not

1207
01:11:50,220 --> 01:11:55,380
impact your expression of femininity at all. I mean, all these are disgusting

1208
01:11:55,380 --> 01:11:55,620
and

1209
01:11:55,620 --> 01:12:00,460
machine sure it does. It makes you annoying. I think your maternal instincts

1210
01:12:00,460 --> 01:12:03,700
just make you annoying because you want me to clean my room. You want me to do

1211
01:12:03,700 --> 01:12:07,800
my homework and what's more important to me than mothering a child is like

1212
01:12:07,800 --> 01:12:13,220
brothering a child, being mother and the sense of you ate right.

1213
01:12:13,220 --> 01:12:18,080
What's more important is that I serve cunt exactly. I'm trying to serve as

1214
01:12:18,080 --> 01:12:22,840
much cunt as in my life. I'm cunt doesn't matter. It's metaphorically

1215
01:12:22,840 --> 01:12:27,100
cunt doesn't matter to you. No, it's about it doesn't matter to me at all.

1216
01:12:27,100 --> 01:12:29,180
It's about did mother eat yeah

1217
01:12:29,180 --> 01:12:36,320
Okay, you guys ever try to feed your grandma. No, my grandma died a couple

1218
01:12:36,320 --> 01:12:39,860
weeks, one of the most horrible experiences. Well, she was you go to

1219
01:12:39,860 --> 01:12:43,900
you go to the you go to whatever you go to whatever, like horrible, maybe on a

1220
01:12:43,900 --> 01:12:44,520
paid episode,

1221
01:12:44,520 --> 01:12:48,640
you go to whatever situation your grandma's in and you feed her and then

1222
01:12:48,640 --> 01:12:52,340
she eats like four or five bites. It really is like grandma. You thought you

1223
01:12:52,340 --> 01:12:53,400
ate right like

1224
01:12:53,400 --> 01:12:55,000
like

1225
01:12:55,800 --> 01:12:57,600
Grandma will take three or four bites and say, "Mm."

1226
01:12:57,600 --> 01:12:58,720
Grandma, you thought you ate.

1227
01:12:58,720 --> 01:13:00,100
You left so much on your plate.

1228
01:13:00,100 --> 01:13:02,440
You left so many crumbs, Grandma.

1229
01:13:02,440 --> 01:13:04,200
Meanwhile, she doesn't know what the hell going on.

1230
01:13:04,200 --> 01:13:06,460
Grandma, the waiter served you meal.

1231
01:13:06,460 --> 01:13:07,080
Yeah.

1232
01:13:07,080 --> 01:13:08,600
Grandma, the waiter served.

1233
01:13:08,600 --> 01:13:09,720
You need to eat, Grandma.

1234
01:13:09,720 --> 01:13:13,000
Grandma, the waiter served you meal, but you didn't eat.

1235
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:14,840
Yeah, but the craziest part-

1236
01:13:14,840 --> 01:13:16,760
The waiter served you meal, and you said it tasted like cunt.

1237
01:13:16,760 --> 01:13:17,500
Oh, my God.

1238
01:13:17,500 --> 01:13:21,500
The craziest part about Grandma eating is that she actually thought that she ate.

1239
01:13:21,500 --> 01:13:22,620
She actually-

1240
01:13:22,620 --> 01:13:24,520
That's how far gone she is.

1241
01:13:24,540 --> 01:13:28,880
I literally thought she had two or three bites of a piece of fish. She even

1242
01:13:28,880 --> 01:13:35,360
said it takes like and she said this. She said she said I mother and you say

1243
01:13:35,360 --> 01:13:39,660
no, your grandma, your mother to somebody, but you thought you ate. You

1244
01:13:39,660 --> 01:13:43,620
left crumbs grandma, your son downing grandma, the fish is breaded. There's

1245
01:13:43,620 --> 01:13:47,660
plenty of crumb yeah and I wish you were crumb downing. I wish you were

1246
01:13:47,660 --> 01:13:48,740
downing those crumbs.

1247
01:13:48,740 --> 01:13:50,840
This fish tastes like

1248
01:13:53,340 --> 01:13:55,860
that's disgusting. All right, there's one more slide here, which is what got

1249
01:13:55,860 --> 01:13:59,980
recommended to me after I viewed these lists. This is the final slide here.

1250
01:13:59,980 --> 01:14:02,420
You may also like ten countries with most

1251
01:14:02,420 --> 01:14:06,900
this was the recommendation on both of these lists.

1252
01:14:06,900 --> 01:14:10,080
I bet the number one is what

1253
01:14:10,080 --> 01:14:15,300
America. I was going to say I was going to say as a slave, the kingdom of evil

1254
01:14:15,300 --> 01:14:18,460
yep, I'm going to be my guess for number one. Well, that's a pretty good

1255
01:14:18,460 --> 01:14:22,980
guest to but I'll go. I'll stay with America for now. Leave world, probably

1256
01:14:23,140 --> 01:14:24,240
slave topia

1257
01:14:24,240 --> 01:14:32,160
okay, okay, well like this guy, if you like if you like these three guys

1258
01:14:32,160 --> 01:14:33,800
podcast about list, and if you also like

1259
01:14:33,800 --> 01:14:39,820
no, if you like slave topia kill yourself, if you like slave topia get

1260
01:14:39,820 --> 01:14:45,740
the fuck out. If you also like home planet, Alex Forest and Joe Gleason well

1261
01:14:45,740 --> 01:14:48,380

1262
01:14:50,340 --> 01:14:51,360

1263
01:14:51,360 --> 01:14:55,040
and they will be amazing.

1264
01:14:55,040 --> 01:14:59,160
And it will be basically having been

1265
01:14:59,160 --> 01:15:00,820
podcast about this

1266
01:15:00,820 --> 01:15:08,280
podcast about this is only a distraction from sketch comedy, which is all of our

1267
01:15:08,280 --> 01:15:10,020
passions. All of our

1268
01:15:10,020 --> 01:15:16,580
study still has about list. I've done it since I was a kid. Yeah, we've done and

1269
01:15:16,620 --> 01:15:20,420
listen. If you even if you like to get to come in, you're coming to the show

1270
01:15:20,420 --> 01:15:23,700
because at first I can't imagine any other possible, which if you want to go

1271
01:15:23,700 --> 01:15:26,700
to swag poop dot com shows. If you want to get tickets for October twentieth,

1272
01:15:26,700 --> 01:15:30,860
but you should also check out pierces whatever video he did

1273
01:15:30,860 --> 01:15:35,340
there's some fucking reddit, but outer years.

1274
01:15:35,340 --> 01:15:39,740
Oh, I thought we were talking about a different one. You just take a matrix

1275
01:15:39,740 --> 01:15:40,380
power point and a

1276
01:15:40,380 --> 01:15:46,020
power point dinosaur in a corner outer space and station infinite jost infinite

1277
01:15:46,060 --> 01:15:50,960
ghost co written by Jordan bold, this even more important than that is the

1278
01:15:50,960 --> 01:15:52,680
sketch show come to the sketch.

1279
01:15:52,680 --> 01:15:58,600
If you came to the last one, which I know you did and you had an amazing

1280
01:15:58,600 --> 01:16:02,380
time, by the way, I saw your faces are not repeating anything besides one or

1281
01:16:02,380 --> 01:16:06,660
two or five things. I'm lying. It's all new. It's completely new new videos,

1282
01:16:06,660 --> 01:16:09,700
new sketches, and it's all Halloween themed except for the stuff that isn't.

1283
01:16:09,700 --> 01:16:14,300
We have video proof of you enjoying the show. We have a full video of the show,

1284
01:16:14,620 --> 01:16:17,520
the whole show. If you were at the last show and you're not at the new one,

1285
01:16:17,520 --> 01:16:22,020
we have a video of you at the last show. We're gonna be comparing faces and I

1286
01:16:22,020 --> 01:16:25,400
know, I know a couple of people in the crowd. I know a couple of you 'cause

1287
01:16:25,400 --> 01:16:27,680
I know some of you are my friends. If you don't show up to the next

1288
01:16:27,680 --> 01:16:31,160
one, I know where you live. Hold on, Pierce is holding his finger. The

1289
01:16:31,160 --> 01:16:33,360
reason none of us can legally drive right now

1290
01:16:33,360 --> 01:16:38,840
because we are celebrating a long day's work of sketch writing. Oh, each of

1291
01:16:38,840 --> 01:16:42,080
us came in here into this office, and Caleb will tell you. We were here

1292
01:16:43,080 --> 01:16:46,200
and we were working up until just now to write

1293
01:16:46,200 --> 01:16:47,040
maybe 10, 11 sketches. - We were writing

1294
01:16:47,040 --> 01:16:48,740
so many sketches. - And honestly,

1295
01:16:48,740 --> 01:16:50,300
the 10, 11 sketches that we wrote today,

1296
01:16:50,300 --> 01:16:51,620
not one of them is gonna make it to--

1297
01:16:51,620 --> 01:16:53,080
- No, no, no, no, no, no, no. - These were trash.

1298
01:16:53,080 --> 01:16:53,920
This was getting filled up. - No, no, no, no, no.

1299
01:16:53,920 --> 01:16:55,860
- Not one. - Because we do this shit,

1300
01:16:55,860 --> 01:16:57,680
it's every day, bro. - Yeah.

1301
01:16:57,680 --> 01:16:59,400
- It's every fucking day, bro.

1302
01:16:59,400 --> 01:17:00,240
It doesn't matter.

1303
01:17:00,240 --> 01:17:01,800
If we write 10 sketches in a day,

1304
01:17:01,800 --> 01:17:03,900
we're gonna write 10 better ones tomorrow.

1305
01:17:03,900 --> 01:17:05,240
And they're all gonna be in the show

1306
01:17:05,240 --> 01:17:06,680
unless there's another day before the show,

1307
01:17:06,680 --> 01:17:07,760
in which case those ones--

1308
01:17:07,760 --> 01:17:08,600
- Or the ones that are gonna be on the show.

1309
01:17:08,600 --> 01:17:11,160
- We ever sketch the day before the show,

1310
01:17:11,160 --> 01:17:14,440
and we come out only hitting home runs.

1311
01:17:14,440 --> 01:17:15,280
- Right.

1312
01:17:15,280 --> 01:17:16,120
- My laney.

1313
01:17:16,120 --> 01:17:18,680
- All right, bye everybody.

1314
01:17:18,680 --> 01:17:21,320
- Oh, we do have a video of the show,

1315
01:17:21,320 --> 01:17:23,760
but I have to pay the origination fee.

1316
01:17:23,760 --> 01:17:24,600
- Not coming out.

1317
01:17:24,600 --> 01:17:25,480
- It's not gonna come out. - Not coming out.

1318
01:17:25,480 --> 01:17:26,600
Bad audio, doesn't matter.

1319
01:17:26,600 --> 01:17:28,400
Bye everybody. - Bye everybody.

1320
01:17:28,400 --> 01:17:30,480
(static)

1321
01:17:30,480 --> 01:17:34,120
- But that's the thing about those labels,

1322
01:17:34,120 --> 01:17:35,200
like the excessive,

1323
01:17:35,200 --> 01:17:38,520
if they were to do the cigarette type things,

1324
01:17:38,520 --> 01:17:42,920
The only warning that they could give on like Doritos and stuff is like, you will become

1325
01:17:42,920 --> 01:17:43,920
fat.

1326
01:17:43,920 --> 01:17:46,920
No, you know what they do is they just have to show a guy who's going like, "Ugh!"

1327
01:17:46,920 --> 01:17:49,920
You'll have a stomach ache warning.

1328
01:17:49,920 --> 01:17:52,880
It would also need to be controlled.

1329
01:17:52,880 --> 01:17:57,120
You'd need to have like an FDA guy who just eats Doritos and is like, "Ugh!"

1330
01:17:57,120 --> 01:18:00,440
How many Doritos can I snap a picture, put it on the bag?

1331
01:18:00,440 --> 01:18:04,840
I guess the other, so it's either stomach ache guy on the picture on the label, or you

1332
01:18:04,840 --> 01:18:10,600
You can have a guy who is too spicy, he's crying, he's tearing up, his nose is dripping.

1333
01:18:10,600 --> 01:18:12,640
These labels would look amazing too.

1334
01:18:12,640 --> 01:18:16,520
Or a little piece of Doritos stuck in the roof of your mouth.

1335
01:18:16,520 --> 01:18:18,320
Yeah, stuck in the tooth.

1336
01:18:18,320 --> 01:18:25,520
I guess the only two warnings you could have, the only two or three is that and dental warning

1337
01:18:25,520 --> 01:18:27,480
on a bag of smart food.

1338
01:18:27,480 --> 01:18:28,480
Yeah, dental warning.

1339
01:18:28,480 --> 01:18:31,880
It will get stuck in your tooth and it will be annoying.

1340
01:18:31,880 --> 01:18:33,440
But then you have to put that on lettuce too.

1341
01:18:33,440 --> 01:18:35,880
Yeah, you got to put down lettuce and kale and all that stuff.

1342
01:18:35,880 --> 01:18:38,240
They should put warnings of everything that can happen with food on every food.

1343
01:18:38,240 --> 01:18:39,760
They need warnings on every food.

1344
01:18:39,760 --> 01:18:45,360
There should be a warning on popsicles that say, "Once you're done with this, brain freeze,

1345
01:18:45,360 --> 01:18:47,640
but once you're done with this, buddy, you're going to laugh."

1346
01:18:47,640 --> 01:18:48,640
Yeah, laughing.

1347
01:18:48,640 --> 01:18:49,640
You're going to laugh.

1348
01:18:49,640 --> 01:18:50,640
Yeah, that's the guy like...

1349
01:18:50,640 --> 01:18:51,640
Pointing at the stick.

1350
01:18:51,640 --> 01:18:52,640
Holding his head, holding his head and his leg.

1351
01:18:52,640 --> 01:18:53,640
Yeah, yeah.

1352
01:18:53,640 --> 01:18:54,640
Is this guy having a heart attack?

1353
01:18:54,640 --> 01:19:00,320
Yeah, we can't tell, but then at the bottom it says, "You're going to get a brain freeze

1354
01:19:00,320 --> 01:19:01,320
and you're going to laugh so hard."

1355
01:19:01,320 --> 01:19:05,760
this to cover every possible side effect. Yeah, brain freeze, maybe else out

1356
01:19:05,760 --> 01:19:10,520
stained hand, stain, good sticky hand, stained hand, laughing at the thing,

1357
01:19:10,520 --> 01:19:13,760
brain freeze and then also you bit into it. So your teeth are cold,

1358
01:19:13,760 --> 01:19:16,160
splinters splinter from the stick,

1359
01:19:16,160 --> 01:19:19,640
it's like a man going through.

1360
01:19:19,640 --> 01:19:21,840
We're actually returning

1361
01:19:21,840 --> 01:19:26,560
to be a Google right now wound man. The only wounds you can get are just

1362
01:19:26,560 --> 01:19:28,240
something stabbing you yeah right.

1363
01:19:29,920 --> 01:19:32,920
I think it might be his feet are fucked up.

1364
01:19:32,920 --> 01:19:35,420
Dude, we need to create the modern Wound Man.

1365
01:19:35,420 --> 01:19:36,120
We just did.

1366
01:19:36,120 --> 01:19:38,220
We did, but he's the food man.

1367
01:19:38,220 --> 01:19:40,820
But we need to create the modern Wound Man.

1368
01:19:40,820 --> 01:19:42,820
The Foond Man.

1369
01:19:42,820 --> 01:19:45,740
(monkey screeching)
