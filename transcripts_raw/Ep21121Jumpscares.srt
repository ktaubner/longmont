00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,080
Come here, come here, come here.

2
00:00:01,080 --> 00:00:02,080
Let me see your butt.

3
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:05,260
- Podcast about Lists.

4
00:00:05,260 --> 00:00:07,840
(upbeat music)

5
00:00:07,840 --> 00:00:10,080
- Crap monster.

6
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:15,000
- Okay, and welcome back to Podcast about Lists.

7
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:15,840
- Give me the date.

8
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:16,660
What date is it?

9
00:00:16,660 --> 00:00:17,500
- It's October 4th.

10
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:18,320
- October 4th.

11
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:20,200
- Today, 2022.

12
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:23,640
- I got a Balls Guarana soda.

13
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:24,480
- Sorry, what's the episode?

14
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:25,320
- Instead of getting a Diet Coke.

15
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:26,440
- Do you know the episode number?

16
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:27,880
- Oh, not off the top of my head.

17
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:29,200
Let me double check really quick.

18
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:30,940
I just feel like I need the heading on this.

19
00:00:30,940 --> 00:00:32,060
- Let's see here.

20
00:00:32,060 --> 00:00:34,340
It would be, that would be episode 211, I believe.

21
00:00:34,340 --> 00:00:35,180
- 211.

22
00:00:35,180 --> 00:00:36,020
- Okay. - Yeah.

23
00:00:36,020 --> 00:00:36,840
- Yep.

24
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:37,680
211.

25
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:39,580
All right, we can just continue.

26
00:00:39,580 --> 00:00:42,420
I'm just gonna be taking some notes today.

27
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:43,420
- Oh, okay.

28
00:00:43,420 --> 00:00:44,500
- Yeah.

29
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:46,300
- Any, all right.

30
00:00:46,300 --> 00:00:47,140
- Just some notes.

31
00:00:47,140 --> 00:00:47,980
- Just notes? - Just for me, yeah.

32
00:00:47,980 --> 00:00:48,820
- About?

33
00:00:48,820 --> 00:00:50,500
- Don't mean about everything.

34
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:52,340
About every part of the show, yeah.

35
00:00:52,340 --> 00:00:53,500
- Okay. - It doesn't matter.

36
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:55,940
- Did you write down that I had like a strong opening?

37
00:00:55,940 --> 00:00:58,180
- It's not about you guys, it's just, you know, for my own.

38
00:00:58,180 --> 00:00:59,140
- Right, but did you write that down?

39
00:00:59,140 --> 00:01:00,140
I don't see anything on the page yet.

40
00:01:00,140 --> 00:01:01,140
I mean I can write, I'll write.

41
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:04,940
Can we pause so I can go buy a Diet Coke?

42
00:01:04,940 --> 00:01:09,460
I mean that's going in the notes if we do.

43
00:01:09,460 --> 00:01:11,540
Is that worth it to you?

44
00:01:11,540 --> 00:01:14,780
Would that be worth it?

45
00:01:14,780 --> 00:01:15,780
Why are you looking at me?

46
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:16,780
It's your decision.

47
00:01:16,780 --> 00:01:17,780
You're one of the three.

48
00:01:17,780 --> 00:01:23,660
I know, I can't look at him though because he's in control of the notepad.

49
00:01:23,660 --> 00:01:24,940
So why do I have to decide?

50
00:01:24,940 --> 00:01:26,940
I mean you can do whatever you want.

51
00:01:26,940 --> 00:01:27,940
You're also in charge.

52
00:01:27,940 --> 00:01:28,940
I'm the only one who isn't.

53
00:01:28,940 --> 00:01:31,940
The one thing I should be in charge of right now is Diet Coke.

54
00:01:31,940 --> 00:01:34,940
It's not like the report card, but you can go.

55
00:01:34,940 --> 00:01:37,940
Yeah, you can go if you want to. I won't reflect.

56
00:01:37,940 --> 00:01:40,940
And it won't be... Alright, pause it.

57
00:01:40,940 --> 00:01:41,940
God.

58
00:01:41,940 --> 00:01:43,940
So you... What happened to the score?

59
00:01:43,940 --> 00:01:45,940
Okay, that's definitely going in the notes.

60
00:01:45,940 --> 00:01:47,940
Yeah, that's going in. He fucking faked me out.

61
00:01:47,940 --> 00:01:50,940
The notes were really... Honestly, they weren't going to be a report card for either of you guys.

62
00:01:50,940 --> 00:01:54,940
It was just so that I could keep my little ideas written down, so I wouldn't interrupt you guys.

63
00:01:54,940 --> 00:01:56,940
Right, so like... Start talking. Say something.

64
00:01:56,940 --> 00:01:59,180
Sure. So, um, over the weekend...

65
00:01:59,180 --> 00:01:59,680
Fat.

66
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:01,900
There could be a fat guy.

67
00:02:01,900 --> 00:02:03,020
Huh?

68
00:02:03,020 --> 00:02:04,460
There could be a fat guy.

69
00:02:04,460 --> 00:02:05,180
In what?

70
00:02:05,180 --> 00:02:06,140
You're calling Cameron...

71
00:02:06,140 --> 00:02:06,940
Cameron started speaking...

72
00:02:06,940 --> 00:02:07,820
What are you talking about?

73
00:02:07,820 --> 00:02:09,420
And then you immediately said fat.

74
00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:09,980
But could...

75
00:02:09,980 --> 00:02:11,180
Are you calling Cameron fat?

76
00:02:11,180 --> 00:02:12,300
See, that's what I mean.

77
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:13,740
I'm trying to streamline.

78
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:15,260
I'm trying to improve my own performance, okay?

79
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:16,860
He's trying to give us body dysmorphia.

80
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:19,180
No, I'm not, you skinny mini.

81
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:24,460
No, I'm not, you skinny mini waif.

82
00:02:25,420 --> 00:02:28,260
Damn it. I didn't want to be a waif.

83
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:30,260
Can I tell you guys a joke I came up with?

84
00:02:30,260 --> 00:02:31,260
Yes, Fat.

85
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:32,260
Okay, never mind.

86
00:02:32,260 --> 00:02:37,260
See, that's what I mean. I need the notepad so I can put the stuff in here.

87
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:39,260
You haven't written a single thing on this notepad.

88
00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:40,260
What are you talking about?

89
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:41,260
He wrote the date.

90
00:02:41,260 --> 00:02:42,260
He did write the date.

91
00:02:42,260 --> 00:02:45,260
Okay, my bad. He wrote the date and he wrote the episode number.

92
00:02:45,260 --> 00:02:47,260
Went over right there at the top of the dash.

93
00:02:47,260 --> 00:02:49,260
He wrote F A plus.

94
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:50,260
That's a lowercase t.

95
00:02:50,260 --> 00:02:52,260
What letters does he mean with the plus?

96
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:53,260
It's a lowercase t.

97
00:02:53,260 --> 00:02:54,260
F A plus more letters.

98
00:02:54,260 --> 00:02:57,940
No, I'm not saying F-A+ one letter or more. I'm not saying that.

99
00:02:57,940 --> 00:02:58,940
That's what he wrote there.

100
00:02:58,940 --> 00:03:05,440
F-A-T. And that's just one of the notes that I'm writing, so I don't just blurt it out loud and ruin the fucking episode.

101
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:05,940
Uh-huh.

102
00:03:05,940 --> 00:03:09,040
Okay, well let's keep it on the notepad then.

103
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:13,340
Okay, I got a piece of wood in my eye earlier and nobody cared. And I didn't even tell anybody.

104
00:03:13,340 --> 00:03:17,040
You did say, "Oh, I got wood in my eye."

105
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:17,740
And nobody said--

106
00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:19,740
And then you got up and you were covered, so I could hear more about you being covered.

107
00:03:19,740 --> 00:03:22,820
- No offers to walk me to the ER

108
00:03:22,820 --> 00:03:25,080
or to carry me all the way to the hospital.

109
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:26,260
You didn't care.

110
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:28,740
I would need, I need to go to the hospital.

111
00:03:28,740 --> 00:03:31,180
- 'Cause I know that you know what to do.

112
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:32,020
- Yeah.

113
00:03:32,020 --> 00:03:34,100
- I trust that you can find your own.

114
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:36,380
- But not even an attempt of,

115
00:03:36,380 --> 00:03:38,660
- No. - Hey, here's some water

116
00:03:38,660 --> 00:03:39,540
for your eye.

117
00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:40,860
- Some water. - Nothing.

118
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:41,700
- You wanted water? - I don't know if that helps.

119
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:43,820
- I don't know what to do with eye stuff.

120
00:03:43,820 --> 00:03:45,740
I've never had my eyes hurt.

121
00:03:45,740 --> 00:03:46,940
- My cat's eyes. - Never had your eyes hurt?

122
00:03:46,940 --> 00:03:47,780
- Speaking of. - Yeah.

123
00:03:47,780 --> 00:03:49,260
- Gotta take him to the vet.

124
00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:50,600
Nice, how was that?

125
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:52,280
I haven't taken him yet.

126
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:53,100
Oh.

127
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:54,800
I have to take him to the vet.

128
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:56,300
Oh, so it's not a story yet.

129
00:03:56,300 --> 00:03:57,140
Yeah, that's not a story yet.

130
00:03:57,140 --> 00:03:57,980
He's saying something that is in the future.

131
00:03:57,980 --> 00:04:00,700
But knowing him, he's a little crazy.

132
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:02,540
It's gonna be a story.

133
00:04:02,540 --> 00:04:04,420
I'm gonna go home for Christmas in December.

134
00:04:04,420 --> 00:04:05,260
Okay.

135
00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:06,080
Yeah.

136
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:06,920
I'm not sure.

137
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:08,700
I think we all might go home for Christmas.

138
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:09,860
Yeah.

139
00:04:09,860 --> 00:04:10,860
So that's pretty interesting.

140
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:11,700
You see what I mean?

141
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:13,700
Like that, if you had a notebook like me,

142
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:15,300
you could've just written down,

143
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:16,140
God, I gotta go to the vet.

144
00:04:16,140 --> 00:04:18,920
No, 'cause he has a, I mean, you've seen Mo,

145
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:23,840
you've seen his eye. Yeah. What's that stand for you know?

146
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:28,680
Because I've wondered... Moreover. It doesn't stand for moreover? Because I've

147
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:33,040
always been wondering what does the Mo stand for? His eye is a little... a little

148
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:35,440
bit of a cloudy eye. I got to do something about that. I think I'm

149
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:39,360
developing a cloudy eye. Not from the outside, but my interior is cloudy.

150
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:43,640
Yeah, my left eye... I think I'm gonna need to get... You have cataracts. I think I have some kind of

151
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:48,200
glaucoma or something. Yeah. Betty Wop style. I think I might lose this eye. I'm worried.

152
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:51,880
See I am worried because I'm like his eye is a little bit

153
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:55,240
swollen and red

154
00:04:55,240 --> 00:05:00,620
Caleb I know Moe's I do get worried sometimes about losing like I think that if you're

155
00:05:00,620 --> 00:05:05,120
I think that if we're they're gonna take out his eye. I think that honestly comedians are at a higher

156
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:11,360
There's it's scarier to have to lose a leg or a finger because that's all they're material

157
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:14,900
Yeah, then you have to become the guy with no with no finger. No, then you're blowing up

158
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:17,440
That's true.

159
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:19,440
You're going to have Instagram Reels.

160
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:21,440
I'm going to love them.

161
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:23,440
Comedian with no fingers.

162
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:25,440
Comedian with no fingers.

163
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:27,440
Kills.

164
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:29,440
Yeah.

165
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:31,440
Comedian with no fingers slays

166
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:33,440
packed crowd.

167
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:35,440
So yeah, I have no fingers.

168
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:37,440
And you have a perfect

169
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:39,440
opener every time.

170
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:41,440
Do you think Steve Hofstetter...

171
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:43,440
Steve Offfingers.

172
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:45,840
That's what you would be if you lost your fingers.

173
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:47,840
But do you think Steve Hofstetter maybe...

174
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:49,840
He already had balls.

175
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:52,840
As soon as he started going, like the heckler thing,

176
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:54,840
like as soon as he started doing like,

177
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:56,840
"Yeah, I'm gonna just destroy hecklers for the rest of my life."

178
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:58,840
Do you think at some point he was like,

179
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:01,840
"What if I just get rid of a leg or something too?"

180
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:04,840
Yeah, elevate it just one more level.

181
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:06,840
Yeah, I mean he really did.

182
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:08,840
I've been working on a series of videos,

183
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:10,840
"Comedian Destroys Hecklers in Wheelchairs."

184
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:12,840
That's a good...

185
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:18,840
in a wheelchair. Yeah. What are they heckling? Usually they say normal heckling stuff. You're

186
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:23,240
not. Oh okay. Shut up. They don't have a specific wheelchair. No. But you have wheelchair retorts.

187
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:27,480
Yeah. I went to the fucking wheelchair and dick sucking factory. No, I don't actually

188
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:30,680
talk about the wheelchairs at all. It just happened. For some reason all of my hecklers

189
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:35,000
just happen to be in wheelchairs or on crutches or have bandages around their heads. But you don't

190
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:40,600
say any jokes about the wheelchair because let's face it, that won't be PC. Yeah, exactly. I don't

191
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:44,020
don't say like hey I'm up here doing stand-up comedy you're down there doing

192
00:06:44,020 --> 00:06:48,940
sit-down uncomedy because it's not funny for a second.

193
00:06:48,940 --> 00:06:52,460
Yeah so you're doing like...

194
00:06:52,460 --> 00:06:56,460
I'm just specific people I guess.

195
00:06:56,460 --> 00:06:58,460
There's something about my vibe.

196
00:06:58,460 --> 00:07:00,460
Because you have a very able-bodied vibe.

197
00:07:00,460 --> 00:07:03,460
Yeah and I think it just makes people in wheelchairs jealous.

198
00:07:03,460 --> 00:07:07,460
[Laughter]

199
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:09,460
Yeah it's truly just a jealousy thing.

200
00:07:09,460 --> 00:07:12,900
Yeah, when I walked down the street pretty much people in wheelchairs look at me, and they're all jealous

201
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:20,360
Yeah, you should yeah, yeah let them know

202
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:29,940
Yeah, I'm gonna make a note of that that was so funny, I'm gonna steal that

203
00:07:29,940 --> 00:07:34,780
Doing is this what the notepad is you you take gonna

204
00:07:34,780 --> 00:07:36,780
We'll do callbacks.

205
00:07:36,780 --> 00:07:40,780
You say jokes that we say on the podcast and then you're gonna go do them in stand-up.

206
00:07:40,780 --> 00:07:42,780
Not in stand-up, I'm writing a movie.

207
00:07:42,780 --> 00:07:50,780
So you're doing like a David Mamet style, like you're just recording your conversations and then using that for dialogue?

208
00:07:50,780 --> 00:07:54,780
No, it's gonna be a new scary movie. Like in the scary movie, like Wayne's Brothers.

209
00:07:54,780 --> 00:07:56,780
Speaking of movies, I went to...

210
00:07:56,780 --> 00:07:58,780
Speaking of movies!

211
00:07:58,780 --> 00:08:03,780
Speaking of movies, I saw Avatar and IMAX on the big IMAX screen over the weekend.

212
00:08:03,780 --> 00:08:08,500
the weekend. Yeah I bet the 3D was really good. There was no 3D. What? You knew that. I wasn't

213
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:11,620
even gonna bring that up because it made me so heartbroken. You didn't have to, hey, come

214
00:08:11,620 --> 00:08:15,620
on. The projector was broken and they didn't do it in 3D. But I still think even without

215
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:19,620
3D it gave me Pandora Syndrome. Yeah? Yeah, I mean I'm watching this movie. What is Pandora

216
00:08:19,620 --> 00:08:24,900
Syndrome? You know when people are like, they watch the movie and they're like, I'm so depressed

217
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:27,900
because I can never live in Pandora, the planet from Avatar. It's like the opposite of Paris

218
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:33,740
Syndrome. But I feel like I watch that movie and I can never look at a human woman if she's

219
00:08:33,740 --> 00:08:35,740
Affectionately again. I

220
00:08:35,740 --> 00:08:40,100
Need her to be eight feet tall and blue. Yeah, and not wearing clothes. Yeah

221
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:45,900
Got her ass her asshole pussy and boobs are out the entire movie what her nipples? Yeah, there's all blue

222
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:50,740
But yeah, but she doesn't even fuck with those. She just fucks with her hair. Yeah, but she they still hug and kiss though

223
00:08:50,740 --> 00:08:51,740
I got a

224
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:56,420
Trust me they hug and which is basically three brother fucking hugging kids all over

225
00:08:57,620 --> 00:09:03,400
Some of those women are giant and blue and beautiful there was an avatar porn parody that came out in

226
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:05,340
2008 and

227
00:09:05,340 --> 00:09:10,840
It came with a blue Navi fleshlight. I do remember seeing pictures

228
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:14,860
Yeah, that's in the movie. Oh wow yeah

229
00:09:14,860 --> 00:09:20,620
They straight up do they have them out the entire time hmm

230
00:09:20,620 --> 00:09:23,020
It was a shot in you were the necklace in front of him

231
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:27,380
It was it was a it was shot in 3d and then it was in a there's a

232
00:09:27,380 --> 00:09:30,860
tabloid story that says woman claims

233
00:09:30,860 --> 00:09:36,640
Watching 3d porn got her pregnant and it was the avatar one dude. Oh my god

234
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:43,360
I would love to get a Navi. I can't believe that she got pregnant by a Navi. Yeah, that's what I was 3d porno, dude

235
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:45,660
That's the dream. Yeah

236
00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:48,500
That's my dream. We were talking last night about

237
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:55,180
Picking specific mates so that you could have a fucking awesome dope big son. Yeah avatar ultimate

238
00:09:55,180 --> 00:10:00,820
Yeah, God, I think you want like to fuck like LeBron James or something. No you want a fucking avatar

239
00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:06,980
Yeah, right cuz it'll split the difference cuz blue mixed with whatever a normal skin tone is it's gonna look pretty fine

240
00:10:06,980 --> 00:10:13,360
It's clear well, so even yeah, cuz I might look a little bit colloidal silver Lee

241
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:17,020
That's okay. That's that's also gonna be nine feet tall. Yeah

242
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:18,760
How tall are the avatars?

243
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:19,760
They're huge.

244
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:20,880
They're like 10 feet tall.

245
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:24,680
So I'm 4 and a half feet or so.

246
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:27,200
But I'm 7 feet tall, so mine's going to be 9 feet tall.

247
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:30,440
My son's going to be like 6'8", 6'9", you know?

248
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:32,400
That's a good, that's like a center in the NBA.

249
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:34,080
Yeah, yeah, you know.

250
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:35,640
I mean probably more like a power forward.

251
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:36,640
Alright.

252
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:37,640
I don't really know that much.

253
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:38,640
Not pushing that.

254
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:44,600
The extent of my knowledge of the NBA all comes from winning time.

255
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:45,600
Really?

256
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:46,600
Mostly.

257
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:47,600
That song?

258
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:54,600
It's time to shoot the basketball, there's hoops and a dribbler is here.

259
00:10:54,600 --> 00:11:05,600
Shooting time, there's popcorn in the stands, and they have ice cream and they have beer.

260
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:20,200
I want to win it's home. I know who I want to win it's home. There's Drake.

261
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:25,400
It's still winning time. Why do you say shooting time?

262
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:29,680
Because they change the... Shooting time is what Patrick thinks that a lot of the

263
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:34,000
NBA players should be subjected to. Whoa!

264
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:38,280
the sports photography while i've been credible you on the sidelines

265
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:42,160
you look like you for the just walking off the court

266
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:47,400
uh... in front of the that canada running down the road and the court petitions

267
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:51,080
does have that that was super bright flashes it's a good thing for trying to

268
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:52,160
answer

269
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:53,000
uh...

270
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,460
dot or and that

271
00:11:55,460 --> 00:11:56,440
at the cool

272
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:59,360
obscured they should have to wear still play

273
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:01,440
to late griffin uh... yeah

274
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:02,280
What team is he on?

275
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:03,900
He, I don't remember.

276
00:12:03,900 --> 00:12:07,960
I think that we need to fix the WNBA.

277
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:09,720
Fix it how?

278
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:10,800
Like, Joana Mann fix it?

279
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:12,320
Like, the ringer fix it?

280
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:13,420
No, what?

281
00:12:13,420 --> 00:12:15,400
Not fix it like, let's fuckin' win.

282
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:17,560
Yeah, fix it like we win.

283
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:18,920
Fix it like spay them.

284
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:21,800
I think it's as simple as we spay them, first of all,

285
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:23,240
and then we just put 'em in something

286
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:24,060
a little more feminine.

287
00:12:24,060 --> 00:12:25,600
When I was a kid, I thought that--

288
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:26,440
Skirts.

289
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:28,980
When I was a kid, I thought that the NBA players

290
00:12:28,980 --> 00:12:31,280
and the WNBA players dated.

291
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:33,280
No, they do not like each other.

292
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:37,280
Or at least the WNBA players don't want to fuck any of the NBA players for some reason.

293
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:39,280
It's like, "Well, it's a match made in heaven."

294
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:42,280
But they end up fucking each other straight or just in black style.

295
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:43,280
Who is it? Lisa Leslie?

296
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:46,280
Lisa Lampanelzi? Yeah, she's funny.

297
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:47,280
Yeah.

298
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:49,280
Who are the other WNBA players I know?

299
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:50,280
Brittany Griner.

300
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:51,280
She got locked up in the...

301
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:56,280
Oh my God, yeah, she got arrested for... rightfully, she got arrested for smoking weed in Russia.

302
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:57,280

303
00:12:57,280 --> 00:12:58,280

304
00:12:58,280 --> 00:12:59,280

What's his name?

327
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:30,760

00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:31,760
Nibbler.

329
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:32,760
What the hell did you just say?

330
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:34,760
It's the name of the character, Patrick.

331
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:35,760
Yeah.

332
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:37,760
It won't work, it's the actual name of the character.

333
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:40,760
Yeah, this guy reads Tom Sawyer, he'd be saying the name of the characters too, I'll tell

334
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:45,320
too, I'll tell you that much. Yeah, old Cameron. What's wrong with saying Tom Sawyer?

335
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:51,320
Wait, no, it's Huck Finn. Huck Finn, Tom Sawyer. Huck Finn has a friendly gen. You know what, I wouldn't read any of it

336
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:56,120
anyway. Yeah. Yeah. I'd read a graphic novel. Your eyes, when you just looked up at

337
00:14:56,120 --> 00:15:02,440
your hat, your eyes were completely crossed. Yeah, I had some of your sawdust on my hat.

338
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:08,720
My sawdust? I'm not wood! You're wood. In what world am I wood? Yeah, and also there's no sawdust in here

339
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:09,840
because we aren't building anything.

340
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:11,480
- Yeah, that's true.

341
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:12,680

00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:17,840
- Yeah. (screams)

345
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:19,040
That actually scared me.

346
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:20,200
- Yeah, that was frightening. - And you can't do stuff,

347
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:21,080
you can't do shit like that.

348
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:23,360
This is now a professional work environment,

349
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:25,160
as of recently, and we've upgraded a lot of the--

350
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:26,720
- That's true, yeah. - Mentalities about our

351
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:28,240
workspace, so you need to stop doing it.

352
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:30,000
- Yeah. - You do need to.

353
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,840
- And Regina, if you're listening,

355
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:35,920
this whole month.

356
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:38,680
- Oh yeah. - Yeah.

357
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:41,360
Oh you want to, well how's it, you spoiled it.

Yeah.

00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:43,360
You spoiled it.

360
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:48,200
Well okay, it's not really spoiling, it's just setting the ground rules for the month.

361
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:51,240
But if you have rules about, oh you're going to get scared now.

362
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:54,000
They had rules in Scream.

363
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,000
Scream was funny though.

364
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,600

Wait, Mike row. No, it's very same as micro

453
00:22:57,060 --> 00:22:59,980
Can you attest to this Patrick?

454
00:23:00,820 --> 00:23:04,860
Yeah, his first name was micro his last name was nothing. Okay, he was green

455
00:23:04,860 --> 00:23:09,020
Micro, no, he was from outer space. Yeah, but he existed

456
00:23:09,020 --> 00:23:17,340
No, his last name was nothing his name was micro nothing I do it, you know, I found out the energy from my green space

457
00:23:17,340 --> 00:23:19,340
I found out the other day if I moved to Korea

458
00:23:19,340 --> 00:23:22,580
My name would be pits Caleb. Yeah

459
00:23:22,580 --> 00:23:25,300
Right. I actually I actually

460
00:23:26,820 --> 00:23:30,660
would also my name would be Fetter Cameron if I moved to the mirror world.

461
00:23:30,660 --> 00:23:34,500
Well is that kind of what Korea is then I guess? I mean that's at least some evidence for that.

462
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:37,500
I think they share some traits. I mean think about it. They literally they have a mirror in the middle.

463
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:42,220
Well that's South Korea. Yeah, it's perfectly mirrored. So maybe North Korea is just the same as America.

464
00:23:42,220 --> 00:23:45,420
Uh-huh. And then South Korea is just... You don't know because there's a big gate around it.

465
00:23:45,420 --> 00:23:49,900
Is that a gator? Is that a gated community? A gate around North Korea. Oh I thought you said there's a big gator

466
00:23:49,900 --> 00:23:54,500
around it. No there's, well trust me. That would be scary if there's a moat. Oh my god.

467
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:57,380
They should change it to a moat. The Great Wall of China should be turned into one of those.

468
00:23:57,380 --> 00:24:02,180
Do you know why every other micronation has failed so far and has been fucking destroyed?

469
00:24:02,180 --> 00:24:04,140
It's because none of them had moats with gators.

470
00:24:04,140 --> 00:24:05,140
Exactly.

471
00:24:05,140 --> 00:24:06,140
That's a good point.

472
00:24:06,140 --> 00:24:07,140
Or sharks.

473
00:24:07,140 --> 00:24:08,140
That's why I keep asking you.

474
00:24:08,140 --> 00:24:09,140
Was Waco a micronation?

475
00:24:09,140 --> 00:24:10,140
No, it was just a cult.

476
00:24:10,140 --> 00:24:12,860
Oh, okay. Well, were they trying to start a micronation?

477
00:24:12,860 --> 00:24:14,860
I don't think so. I think they just were a cult.

478
00:24:14,860 --> 00:24:16,580
Who was trying to start the micronation?

479
00:24:16,580 --> 00:24:17,580
Who was trying to start the micronation?

480
00:24:17,580 --> 00:24:18,580
You dirty job, micro.

481
00:24:18,580 --> 00:24:19,580
Was it, was it?

482
00:24:19,580 --> 00:24:20,580
I already said that.

483
00:24:20,580 --> 00:24:21,580
Huh?

484
00:24:21,580 --> 00:24:22,580
I'm just talking to myself.

485
00:24:22,580 --> 00:24:23,580
Oh, microstation.

486
00:24:23,580 --> 00:24:24,920
- Micro station. - So try running.

487
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:26,720
(laughing)

488
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:28,800
I'm just talking to myself 'cause I turned crazy.

489
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:31,240
- Whereas it wasn't Ruby Ridge, was it?

490
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:32,320
That was-- - It might be.

491
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:33,840
- That's a porn star.

492
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:35,120
- No. - No?

493
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:37,620
- You're thinking of Ruby Tuesday.

494
00:24:37,620 --> 00:24:39,920

00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:51,400
and then you put the pencil down.

501
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:53,160

00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:01,400
handwriting

built a concrete hold ship called freedom

510
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:22,400
which they sailed to the caribbean intending to permanently anchor it as

511
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:26,160
their territory. The ship sank in a hurricane and the project was abandoned.

512
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:29,640
Yeah. Isn't there one that's still like that? That's my impression of them.

Yeah, let's make the ship out of concrete. Yeah, this one's like, let's make it out of

540
00:27:38,420 --> 00:27:44,100
I straight up think that we should get a Costco membership for like one month, buy a mini

541
00:27:44,100 --> 00:27:47,580
fridge and then just filled up with awesome sodas.

542
00:27:47,580 --> 00:27:52,740
This is an idea that I've had for a while.

543
00:27:52,740 --> 00:27:55,140
I think a Costco membership is like 8 bucks.

544
00:27:55,140 --> 00:27:57,500
We probably could get a business card.

545
00:27:57,500 --> 00:27:58,500
At Costco?

546
00:27:58,500 --> 00:27:59,500

589
00:30:09,580 --> 00:30:12,740
this is that website we've been doing this is the last one I don't on this

590
00:30:12,740 --> 00:30:17,180
website ghost Street um which we did the ones about the breasts this is an

591
00:30:17,180 --> 00:30:20,900
important handsome because this is at the end of a trilogy this is the third

592
00:30:20,900 --> 00:30:26,180
this theory this is gonna go down in hillogy mm-hmm as a trillid as a

593
00:30:26,180 --> 00:30:31,500
trister II it's the end of the trilogy it's also the end of ghost street with

594
00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:39,420
the start of jump scare month. Jump Street month. Do we call it Jump Street or what

595
00:30:39,420 --> 00:30:42,900
are we calling because I know that every episode... What are we calling? We call it

596
00:30:42,900 --> 00:30:48,020
like 21 Jump Street but we call it like 8 jump scares. 21 jump scares and there's 21

597
00:30:48,020 --> 00:30:50,780
jump scares throughout the month. How many episodes do we do? Well it doesn't matter

598
00:30:50,780 --> 00:30:55,540
we just put in 21. Yeah yeah. 21 total by the end of the month. I think that we should

599
00:30:55,540 --> 00:30:57,380
have a lot more jump scares.

600
00:30:57,380 --> 00:30:58,220
- Than 21?

601
00:30:58,220 --> 00:30:59,040
- 21 is--

602
00:30:59,040 --> 00:30:59,880
- That's way--

603
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:00,720
(screams)

604
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:02,040
- We already used up two.

605
00:31:02,040 --> 00:31:02,880
- Yeah, exactly.

606
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:03,700
- Yeah, exactly.

607
00:31:03,700 --> 00:31:04,540
- So we have at least--

608
00:31:04,540 --> 00:31:05,380
- We have to have 21.

609
00:31:05,380 --> 00:31:08,540
- Yeah, so we get two each at 16 total.

610
00:31:08,540 --> 00:31:10,900
- Yeah, 21 is the perfect number.

611
00:31:10,900 --> 00:31:11,900
- So we got, now we have a couple,

612
00:31:11,900 --> 00:31:15,340
we'll add some extra ones for some of the extra ones.

613
00:31:15,340 --> 00:31:17,060
- Yeah, but I feel like that jump scare you just did

614
00:31:17,060 --> 00:31:17,900
is just--

615
00:31:17,900 --> 00:31:19,260
(screams)

616
00:31:19,260 --> 00:31:20,820
- You were the one complaining we were doing,

617
00:31:20,820 --> 00:31:22,660
that we burned through two and you got three.

618
00:31:22,660 --> 00:31:23,800
- Now you've done two in like a minute.

619
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:24,980
- And it was so close, too.

620
00:31:24,980 --> 00:31:36,460
21 jump scares. We have 18 left. I think it should be the 31 days of Halloween. There's

621
00:31:36,460 --> 00:31:41,020
one day of Halloween. We're starting this on the 4th day of October. We're only releasing

622
00:31:41,020 --> 00:31:48,620
episodes on 8 of the days. You can't divide 8 by 21. That's why it's scary because it's

623
00:31:48,620 --> 00:31:52,580
random. We don't want it to be per exact. Maybe this one has zero. Maybe next episode

624
00:31:52,580 --> 00:31:55,700
there's none of them but then there are a bunch of them in a row yeah and we'll

625
00:31:55,700 --> 00:31:58,980
save the lap but we'll save the last one for the end uh-huh cuz there's gonna be

626
00:31:58,980 --> 00:32:03,620
a lot of jump scares yeah on the Monday but anyway this is Halloween this is

627
00:32:03,620 --> 00:32:10,860
under the category Miranda ghost and this is a special October list called top 10

Yeah, you slept all you ran.

638
00:32:51,020 --> 00:32:52,500

640
00:32:53,500 --> 00:32:54,500

641
00:32:54,500 --> 00:32:55,500
Okay.

642
00:32:55,500 --> 00:32:56,500
What the hell is wrong with Forrest Gump?

643
00:32:56,500 --> 00:33:03,160
Oh, you know what the real Gump scare is, is when you go to Bubba Gump and you find

644
00:33:03,160 --> 00:33:05,780
a toenail in your coconut shrimp.

645
00:33:05,780 --> 00:33:06,780
Did I already talk on the podcast about-

646
00:33:06,780 --> 00:33:08,580
In October I would love to find a toadstool.

647
00:33:08,580 --> 00:33:12,380

648
00:33:12,380 --> 00:33:13,380
You?

649
00:33:13,380 --> 00:33:14,380
No.

650
00:33:14,380 --> 00:33:17,140
He was- We were watching Nathan For You with my cousin at his house.

651
00:33:17,140 --> 00:33:18,840
He walked in, watched it for two minutes,

652
00:33:18,840 --> 00:33:22,720
he's like, "Jesus Christ, is this guy retarded or something?"

653
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:25,840
He just didn't, he was like, "This guy is stupid."

654
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:27,680
And he wouldn't stop talking about it.

655
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:30,300
Then he was like, "Oh, so he's a YouTuber."

656
00:33:30,300 --> 00:33:31,380
(laughing)

657

00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:40,300
search for victims as food, which is more frightening. Supposedly humans can also

827
00:41:40,300 --> 00:41:43,720
be turned into a Wendigo when doing certain ritua. I've never heard of a

828
00:41:43,720 --> 00:41:47,640
Wendigo. Really? I've never heard of a Rituala. It's a Native American monster. It

829
00:41:47,640 --> 00:41:54,240
looks like a circle. Yeah, they've circled nothing in this picture. Have you ever played Until Dawn? Yeah, love that.

830
00:41:54,240 --> 00:42:00,240
That's about Wendigos. What? Yeah. Really? A Wendigo is like a skinwalker. He's clearly never read the journal.

831
00:42:00,240 --> 00:42:01,840
It's the same type of thing.

832
00:42:01,840 --> 00:42:05,640
I don't like when the ghost is on the movie.

833
00:42:05,640 --> 00:42:08,840
I'm going to look up a picture of a windigo.

834
00:42:08,840 --> 00:42:09,840
I actually searched windify.

835
00:42:09,840 --> 00:42:12,840
It looks like it has antlers, I think.

836
00:42:12,840 --> 00:42:15,240
Oh, okay, a windigo.

837
00:42:15,240 --> 00:42:16,240
Yeah, okay.

838
00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:17,240
Yeah.

839
00:42:17,240 --> 00:42:18,240
Yeah, okay.

840
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:20,240
So apparently, according to this, it came from outer space.

841
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:21,240
Like from a ritual.

842
00:42:21,240 --> 00:42:22,240
Which I didn't know about.

843
00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:25,240
That's actually a Jotun.

844
00:42:25,240 --> 00:42:26,240
But it kind of looks like it.

845
00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:27,240
Which is actually a Norse god.

846
00:42:27,240 --> 00:42:28,240
It's a Jotun.

847
00:42:28,240 --> 00:42:29,740
It's an ancient Norse name for John.

848
00:42:29,740 --> 00:42:33,100
how about you move your ton of ass yeah how about you put your ton back in your

849
00:42:33,100 --> 00:42:39,640
damn pants and how much you don't drop that ton ton ton ton ton ton that was

850
00:42:39,640 --> 00:42:47,860
honestly like the earlier thing where you beam ton ton into my head okay what's

851
00:42:47,860 --> 00:42:51,220
next number seven is Banshee. You got somewhere to go you keep looking at the clock yeah

852
00:42:51,220 --> 00:42:57,580
sure. I have to take my cat to the vet. Is he about to die? I don't know he's got a weird eye

853
00:42:57,580 --> 00:43:03,860
thing he's had that for the entire time it hasn't been read it's a little swollen

854
00:43:03,860 --> 00:43:07,740
right maybe he's becoming evil like Kotor yeah maybe it's showing up in his

855
00:43:07,740 --> 00:43:10,860
appearance he's grown horns you have veiny skin that's true maybe he's

856
00:43:10,860 --> 00:43:13,860
turning into an incubus whenever I see some guy at the gym with like way too

857
00:43:13,860 --> 00:43:19,580
many veins I'm like you do realize I mean do you fucking evil right yeah I

858
00:43:19,580 --> 00:43:23,140
feel like if you have a lot of veins you're weaker cuz you can just get them

859
00:43:23,140 --> 00:43:27,900
Mm-hmm. I get just pull them out of someone if I see them. What is this a banshee?

860
00:43:27,900 --> 00:43:30,700
Yeah

861
00:43:30,700 --> 00:43:34,820
Banshee is a ghost. I'm just gonna hold on a minute. You know what a banshee is

862
00:43:34,820 --> 00:43:39,580
The banshee is a ghost yeah

863
00:43:39,580 --> 00:43:41,900
I

864
00:43:41,900 --> 00:43:44,820
Thought a banshee was a purple plane that you ride

865
00:43:44,820 --> 00:43:51,820
Even then it's a taxi ghosts that is shaped naked woman with a very creepy face with disheveled hair

866
00:43:51,820 --> 00:43:55,620
This ghost is a sign of death that when there is a voice crying Banshee backyard

867
00:43:55,620 --> 00:44:00,860
Then there will be people that are going to die at home. Yeah, I hate when the moon. I'm outside in here

868
00:44:00,860 --> 00:44:06,880
Me too, and then I go out in the backyard and I get killed by a Banshee

869
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:12,720
Yeah, I tell you what though that looks less like a Banshee more like some kind of clansmen if Klu Klux Klan

870
00:44:12,720 --> 00:44:16,620
Yeah, that's true. If if you were in your house, and you heard someone outside

871
00:44:16,620 --> 00:44:21,220
Like in a ghostly voice say backyard. Would you go in your backyard?

872
00:44:21,220 --> 00:44:26,380
yard? If you heard somebody say in a ghostly voice you're next in line for

873
00:44:26,380 --> 00:44:31,380
the death for death and it was from like maybe the end of a dark hallway and you

874
00:44:31,380 --> 00:44:34,740
saw like teeth and like eyes and stuff and it was saying yeah you're next in

875
00:44:34,740 --> 00:44:37,900
line for death would you walk towards that or would you probably just stay in

876
00:44:37,900 --> 00:44:42,340
your home? You saw the killer. There's a hallway outside of my home? Alright

877
00:44:42,340 --> 00:44:45,660
hypothetical if there's a killer on the loose and you've seen this on the news

878
00:44:45,660 --> 00:44:49,620
right but then you open up your closet and there's a sign that says the killers

879
00:44:49,620 --> 00:44:52,800
near and it's written in your own blood right but then you look down your

880
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:56,160
fingers are all pricked you realize you're crazy are you gonna go kill

881
00:44:56,160 --> 00:45:01,240
yourself are you killing other people others okay hmm others yeah so if you

882
00:45:01,240 --> 00:45:05,760
walk in make you the killer if you see a clown super statue right uh-huh give it

883
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:09,680
a kiss super statue well it's bigger it's huge yeah if you see some leveled

884
00:45:09,680 --> 00:45:13,800
up from yeah you say where's the you tell the where's the beef you say where

885
00:45:13,800 --> 00:45:18,640
you took all the parents you say was up say where's the beef yeah and then they

886
00:45:18,640 --> 00:45:23,680
tell you exactly where all that is. Are you gonna go eat the beef or what?

887
00:45:23,680 --> 00:45:30,720
I don't... I think I might. Okay. That's pretty cool.

888
00:45:30,720 --> 00:45:35,840
Number six is doppelganger. I don't think that's a ghost. I think that's

889
00:45:35,840 --> 00:45:38,960
some kind of genetic... Well let's find out.

890
00:45:38,960 --> 00:45:41,680
Let's just find out if it's a ghost.

891
00:45:41,680 --> 00:45:44,440
Why don't you read right here and see what it says about it being a ghost.

892
00:45:44,440 --> 00:45:47,240
What if you see yourself in front of your own? Yes.

893
00:45:47,240 --> 00:45:54,520
Doppelganger is a figure where it resembles a ghost yourself, not just physically, but also the behavior and dress exactly the same as you.

894
00:45:54,520 --> 00:45:58,800
Supposedly, if you look at the doppelganger, it means death will soon pick you.

895
00:45:58,800 --> 00:46:04,260
So that's pretty much exactly what you just said about the hallway, too. Okay, so you look into the hallway. It's a complete

896
00:46:04,260 --> 00:46:09,240
ganger of you. Yeah. And you are saying, "Wait,

897
00:46:09,240 --> 00:46:10,760
I don't have a mirror in my hallway."

898
00:46:10,760 --> 00:46:13,960
right? And then the doppelganger starts moving towards you, his hands turn into

899
00:46:13,960 --> 00:46:18,320
claws, his mouth turns into a knife. Are you running away or are you running towards it

900
00:46:18,320 --> 00:46:21,760
trying to bang the mirror? If I run away it will chase me because it's the

901
00:46:21,760 --> 00:46:25,840
same as me. What would you do if you saw your funniest cousin? I'd probably bang him.

902
00:46:25,840 --> 00:46:28,880
What if you looked into magic glass and you saw something that looked exactly

903
00:46:28,880 --> 00:46:32,920
like you? I'd probably bang that too. Yeah, yeah. I'd probably bang it till it died.

904
00:46:32,920 --> 00:46:37,360
The funniest cousin who's a doppelganger of you? I'd bang him till he smelled bad.

905
00:46:37,360 --> 00:46:44,160
would he smell better with the room smell I'd smell him badly I think you wouldn't

906
00:46:44,160 --> 00:46:48,840
smell him you would stink him I'd stink him up with by banging him to death

907
00:46:48,840 --> 00:46:57,680
thinking I'd be stinking yeah you guys see the Jeffrey Dahmer movies the Jeremy

908
00:46:57,680 --> 00:47:02,320
Renner one the bomb one where's Jeffrey Dahmer in the Middle East he's diffusing

909
00:47:02,320 --> 00:47:06,760
bombs in the yeah yeah so getting a tattoo hmm why is this guy why are we

910
00:47:06,760 --> 00:47:11,320
vilifying this hero I don't understand yeah yeah but there's any sense Jeffrey

911
00:47:11,320 --> 00:47:15,440
Dahmer movie he apparently I didn't know this he's trying to make he's trying to

912
00:47:15,440 --> 00:47:18,760
make robotic zombies that's what he was doing in real life yeah I know I didn't

913
00:47:18,760 --> 00:47:25,200
know yeah it's crazy he's in he's crazy dude he's the guy was nuts oh he was

914
00:47:25,200 --> 00:47:30,160
there's that serial killers go is such a yeah he is crazy he was making zombie

915
00:47:30,160 --> 00:47:33,520
slaves pretty cool yeah sex slaves he would drill into people's heads and like

916
00:47:33,520 --> 00:47:38,220
pour acid into their brains. He also made everybody watch The Exorcist 3.

917
00:47:38,220 --> 00:47:44,300
The third one. The one with the "BURP!" Yeah, yeah, yeah. It took me a second, yeah, but yes.

918
00:47:44,300 --> 00:47:49,120
Yeah, that one. Yeah, that's a good movie. With Brad Dourif and Dorsey Scott. Yeah. Good, good movie.

919
00:47:49,120 --> 00:47:53,860
It is such a good movie. Jeffrey Dahmer, if you will, his taste in movies and men.

920
00:47:53,860 --> 00:47:56,560
That's what I was saying, dude. I feel like if I could sit down with

921
00:47:56,560 --> 00:47:59,440
Jeffrey Dahmer, I could just like hash it out. I feel like I could have a

922
00:47:59,440 --> 00:48:02,800
breakthrough. I feel like me and him could connect on some level about movies.

923
00:48:02,800 --> 00:48:05,760
I think he'd break through the fucking front. I think you know you could know

924
00:48:05,760 --> 00:48:11,480
I was I was saying this to Patrick Jeffrey Dahmer would not kill me because I would give it up for him and my and I

925
00:48:11,480 --> 00:48:17,800
Would it would change him you think that I would give him I would give him but so good you think you would see you

926
00:48:17,800 --> 00:48:23,320
Would stop you think he'd give a magic, but yeah, I think it's the one I think that I

927
00:48:23,320 --> 00:48:28,680
Think if I could if I save it up, and I get fucked in the same it up one time

928
00:48:29,800 --> 00:48:31,800
If I'm like

929
00:48:31,800 --> 00:48:40,380
Like if I never get if I never get butted my whole life

930
00:48:40,380 --> 00:48:45,440
My whole life you watch it Virginia. I'm like, you know, I'm in I'm

931
00:48:45,440 --> 00:48:51,760
Early 30s. Okay at this point cuz still young enough to for Jeffrey Dahmer to wanna see it, but me but the buddy

932
00:48:51,760 --> 00:48:57,540
But I've been here as you get older. No, dude, I've been doing stuff. Yeah. Yeah, I've been I've been a lot ease and stuff

933
00:48:57,540 --> 00:49:01,340
of yeah all sorts of I mean basically everything under the sun and then

934
00:49:01,340 --> 00:49:04,700
where the thing that thing yeah the sun dry exactly now like a race yeah.

935
00:49:04,700 --> 00:49:10,420
I think I think I'm getting down on the bed. I think I'm putting my butt up in

936
00:49:10,420 --> 00:49:14,620
the air and I think I'm jack hammering him like I have control of the situation

937
00:49:14,620 --> 00:49:17,160
of course, like he he he doesn't even want

938
00:49:17,160 --> 00:49:29,160
(laughter)

939
00:49:29,160 --> 00:49:32,160
And I think he's never killing anyone ever again after that.

940
00:49:32,160 --> 00:49:34,160
So you're showing up to jail.

941
00:49:34,160 --> 00:49:37,160
You're going into the...

942
00:49:37,160 --> 00:49:38,160
You're doing a...

943
00:49:38,160 --> 00:49:40,160
I don't think... I think in this scenario...

944
00:49:40,160 --> 00:49:41,160
This is pre-jail.

945
00:49:41,160 --> 00:49:42,160
This is pre-first jail.

946
00:49:42,160 --> 00:49:43,160
He hasn't been caught yet.

947
00:49:43,160 --> 00:49:45,160
This is like 22 years old.

948
00:49:45,160 --> 00:49:47,160
This is the inglorious bastards of Jeffrey Cameron.

949
00:49:47,160 --> 00:49:49,160
Cameron has a time machine.

950
00:49:49,160 --> 00:49:51,160
Yeah, yeah, he's going back before his first kill.

951
00:49:51,160 --> 00:49:53,160
So you force him into your crazy tight butt.

952
00:49:53,160 --> 00:49:57,160
Which we've established is magically delicious.

953
00:49:57,160 --> 00:49:59,160
It's full of mana.

954
00:49:59,160 --> 00:50:01,160
It's never been used and it's ready to be used.

955
00:50:01,160 --> 00:50:03,160
Okay, yeah.

956
00:50:03,160 --> 00:50:05,160
It's like a pear.

957
00:50:05,160 --> 00:50:07,160
You know when the pear is the perfect ripeness?

958
00:50:07,160 --> 00:50:09,160
Yeah, it's folded.

959
00:50:09,160 --> 00:50:11,160
It takes like 30 years for a butt to get that ripe.

960
00:50:11,160 --> 00:50:13,160
It's perfectly crispy like a white Hanes t-shirt out of a bag.

961
00:50:13,160 --> 00:50:18,080
clean and it's really clean it's going never never not vacuumed it never only

962
00:50:18,080 --> 00:50:23,000
things ever came out of the car one yeah I went to the car wash and I use like a

963
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:28,560
three a three gallon fleet yeah your but you dropped a gallon of fabuloso down

964
00:50:28,560 --> 00:50:32,000
there yeah there's I mean it's fabulous everything everything that you could put

965
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:37,400
in there to make it better I did that okay and then you blow his mind yeah

966
00:50:37,400 --> 00:50:41,360
right and he says wow I never want to make a fucking zombie sex slave in my

967
00:50:41,360 --> 00:50:45,260
Yeah, exactly. There's one thing I know I never want to do is kidnap a 16 year

968
00:50:45,260 --> 00:50:48,360
old boy and turn him into a sex. Right? Yeah, it's like that could never be as

969
00:50:48,360 --> 00:50:52,060
good as this leg and then maybe in front of him. I get back into my time machine.

970
00:50:52,060 --> 00:50:56,760
I'm like you want to get this again. You got to see you got to survive till till

971
00:50:56,760 --> 00:51:02,960
2022. You got to stay out of jail be a good clean boy Christian boy. Maybe I'll

972
00:51:02,960 --> 00:51:06,560
give you this again. Then I'll play kind of toss my butt like do a little like

973
00:51:06,560 --> 00:51:07,400
yeah

974
00:51:07,400 --> 00:51:09,440
doesn't know your shoulder like it

975
00:51:09,440 --> 00:51:13,600
up of my uh... kind of my hand on my head and and swing to a little swing

976
00:51:13,600 --> 00:51:15,080
if you ever want to see this again

977
00:51:15,080 --> 00:51:18,600
and then you are not going to have a lot of other people

978
00:51:18,600 --> 00:51:20,660
what's the fact that this appear

979
00:51:20,660 --> 00:51:22,280
uh... and i think that you

980
00:51:22,280 --> 00:51:25,480
and when he gets if he'd makes it all of them for me again

981
00:51:25,480 --> 00:51:26,600
back in the future

982
00:51:26,600 --> 00:51:29,840
yeah well but you also had like tell him like what i don't be bad

983
00:51:29,840 --> 00:51:33,280
you got a tell me you have a memorized so that i was so bad i think i think

984
00:51:33,280 --> 00:51:40,280
killing people again. Well it's just immediately after the last one because you just time travel.

985
00:51:40,280 --> 00:51:46,280
You also have to think if you do that and you go back to the future what if the idea

986
00:51:46,280 --> 00:51:51,380
of him not having that makes him go crazy. That's not my fault. Oh and then it's even

987
00:51:51,380 --> 00:51:55,880
worse because he's trying to make the holes in people, he's trying to turn them into SpongeBob.

988
00:51:55,880 --> 00:52:01,640
Yeah he's trying to either turn them into SpongeBob or doing surgery on their butts. I mean honestly

989
00:52:01,640 --> 00:52:05,960
If that happens, it's not my problem because I did more than anyone else did to try and stop him.

990
00:52:05,960 --> 00:52:09,720
That's true. Almost nobody did anything to stop Jeffrey Dahmer based on the movie.

991
00:52:09,720 --> 00:52:10,220
Yeah.

992
00:52:10,220 --> 00:52:11,320
Yeah, cops kept coming up.

993
00:52:11,320 --> 00:52:13,560
What do these people try to do? Run away?

994
00:52:13,560 --> 00:52:15,000
Yeah, guess not.

995
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:16,120
Tell people about him?

996
00:52:16,120 --> 00:52:18,280
No, dude. Throw it back on him.

997
00:52:18,280 --> 00:52:19,400
Yeah, ruin his life.

998
00:52:19,400 --> 00:52:19,960
That's right.

999
00:52:19,960 --> 00:52:20,440
Yeah.

1000
00:52:20,440 --> 00:52:20,920
Yeah.

1001
00:52:20,920 --> 00:52:23,480
He's trying to take your life. You need to ruin his life, girl.

1002
00:52:23,480 --> 00:52:25,560
He has no bed frame.

1003
00:52:25,560 --> 00:52:26,680
No way.

1004
00:52:26,680 --> 00:52:31,320
So that's why nobody ever gave him an X-Level, but because he's a slob.

1005
00:52:31,320 --> 00:52:32,320
He was a total slob.

1006
00:52:32,320 --> 00:52:33,320
Right?

1007
00:52:33,320 --> 00:52:37,560
He opened up the fridge, there's fucking tongues and teeth and brains and eye sockets and shit,

1008
00:52:37,560 --> 00:52:39,160
and you're like, "Jesus Christ, clean it up.

1009
00:52:39,160 --> 00:52:40,160
At least do some meal prep.

1010
00:52:40,160 --> 00:52:42,160
You know, get your shit together.

1011
00:52:42,160 --> 00:52:43,160
Overnight oats."

1012
00:52:43,160 --> 00:52:44,160
I would have gone back.

1013
00:52:44,160 --> 00:52:45,320
See, I would have taken a different thing.

1014
00:52:45,320 --> 00:52:46,880
I would have tried to become his gym buddy.

1015
00:52:46,880 --> 00:52:48,520
Try to get him on a new program.

1016
00:52:48,520 --> 00:52:50,280
Would have been, "Hey, creatine.

1017
00:52:50,280 --> 00:52:51,280
It's good for your brain.

1018
00:52:51,280 --> 00:52:52,280
We're gonna get you on..."

1019
00:52:52,280 --> 00:52:54,560
That's actually a great idea, is to make him really, really strong.

1020
00:52:54,560 --> 00:52:59,080
That would actually really help out in that situation, if he was extremely strong and powerful.

1021
00:52:59,080 --> 00:53:02,480
take out that stress in the jaw. Powerful. And maybe he might even kill a

1022
00:53:02,480 --> 00:53:06,520
professional bodybuilder, right? But if he only kills one bodybuilder, that's

1023
00:53:06,520 --> 00:53:12,040
enough meat to last you a lifetime. So why is it? That's the problem, he's going to

1024
00:53:12,040 --> 00:53:15,400
these gay clubs with these little skinny guys and he's eating one of them being

1025
00:53:15,400 --> 00:53:18,920
like, "Oh, I'm still fucking hungry," right? It's like when you buy a rotisserie chicken.

1026
00:53:18,920 --> 00:53:22,200
I'll eat two rotisserie chickens if they're not from Costco. Exactly. If they're too

1027
00:53:22,200 --> 00:53:26,320
small, I'll go, I'll eat one, I'll go, "Fuck, I'm still hungry." Go back, eat another. But

1028
00:53:26,320 --> 00:53:30,320
But if I got one of those Costco big ass roto chicks, I'm fucking good for days.

1029
00:53:30,320 --> 00:53:31,960
I don't like a chicken salad with leftovers.

1030
00:53:31,960 --> 00:53:36,920
My strategy is entirely different from both of yours.

1031
00:53:36,920 --> 00:53:43,680
I go back in time and then I bring him even farther back in time.

1032
00:53:43,680 --> 00:53:49,720
I go into the time machine, I take Jeffrey Dahmer, I grab him, bring him into the portal,

1033
00:53:49,720 --> 00:53:52,720
it's a portal based one.

1034
00:53:52,720 --> 00:53:54,280
I go all the way back.

1035
00:53:54,280 --> 00:53:56,280
I show him Rick and Morty.

1036
00:53:56,280 --> 00:54:00,120
Okay, well, you didn't have to come in with a better idea.

1037
00:54:00,120 --> 00:54:01,120
I'm sorry, okay, continue.

1038
00:54:01,120 --> 00:54:02,120
You already had yours.

1039
00:54:02,120 --> 00:54:03,120
You go all the way back.

1040
00:54:03,120 --> 00:54:08,560
Well, no, because now it's like, if I showed him Rick and Morty, he would understand that

1041
00:54:08,560 --> 00:54:11,640
like depression is actually like something that you can get help for.

1042
00:54:11,640 --> 00:54:13,760
It would kind of cure him of his kind of like solipsism.

1043
00:54:13,760 --> 00:54:14,760
That's true.

1044
00:54:14,760 --> 00:54:15,760
Yeah.

1045
00:54:15,760 --> 00:54:16,760
He would have a really, he'd be like, okay, other people don't matter.

1046
00:54:16,760 --> 00:54:18,960
You know what another good solution is, is maybe cut off his head.

1047
00:54:18,960 --> 00:54:19,960
See, that's what I was going to do.

1048
00:54:19,960 --> 00:54:20,960
It's too hard and bloody.

1049
00:54:20,960 --> 00:54:26,560
him back in time to like the 1700s. Well then what he's doing would be okay.

1050
00:54:26,560 --> 00:54:30,080
If he was in the 1700s there wouldn't be a problem.

1051
00:54:30,080 --> 00:54:35,480
He's our king. I'd bring him back to the year 33.

1052
00:54:35,480 --> 00:54:39,520
Okay and I think I do know where you're going with this. I'd show him the miracles of

1053
00:54:39,520 --> 00:54:43,320
Jesus Christ. Jesus Christ multiplying the bread. Jesus Christ

1054
00:54:43,320 --> 00:54:48,200
baptizing John the Baptist. Jesus Christ rising again after he's been

1055
00:54:48,200 --> 00:54:51,760
crucified, right? He's turning water to wine, all this stuff. He's walking on

1056
00:54:51,760 --> 00:54:55,800
water at the end, right, with the disciples. I would show him all that and I

1057
00:54:55,800 --> 00:55:00,360
say, "With all of that in mind, with the glory of Jesus Christ in your brain,

1058
00:55:00,360 --> 00:55:04,200
you know, all the Old Testament myths are true, do you still want to go make a

1059
00:55:04,200 --> 00:55:09,320
zombie sex slave five-year-old?" And if you do, then... If you are, I just want you

1060
00:55:09,320 --> 00:55:13,000
to know, you will be... like, first of all, all your victims are gonna be fucking in

1061
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:17,640
heaven, and fucking each other in heaven, and all of you, you're gonna be in a

1062
00:55:17,640 --> 00:55:21,520
lake of fire yeah right you're gonna be fucking burning alive forever right

1063
00:55:21,520 --> 00:55:25,520
eventually there's gonna be a full-on tribulation if that happens in your

1064
00:55:25,520 --> 00:55:29,080
lifestyle in your lifetime and your lifestyle yeah right and you're gonna

1065
00:55:29,080 --> 00:55:35,680
suffer facts yeah did us I'd go back in time and kill him yeah yeah that also

1066
00:55:35,680 --> 00:55:43,000
would work to kill him with like a kindness okay ah swan that number five

1067
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:51,600
Aswang. Look at this picture. That is old Greg. That is Patrick on any holiday.

1068
00:55:51,600 --> 00:55:58,200
Pat, go ahead, take this one. Ghosts that this one is very well known in his home

1069
00:55:58,200 --> 00:56:04,720
country, namely the Philippines. That's the sound it makes.

1070
00:56:04,720 --> 00:56:09,520
Aswang is a traditional ghost in the Philippines shaped like a cross between

1071
00:56:12,520 --> 00:56:16,780
stories are powerful terrible and sometimes can turn into a giant black

1072
00:56:16,780 --> 00:56:22,660
bear it is said during the day I swung bridge a little try that again

1073
00:56:22,660 --> 00:56:32,940
Baru no just Baruja Dukhan a man like he did that to a man yeah Baruja

1074
00:56:32,940 --> 00:56:37,900
gotten done well not just a man keep going with a quiet personality even

1075
00:56:37,900 --> 00:56:44,260
while in the next will turn into a ghost and act cruel and creepy even a man with

1076
00:56:44,260 --> 00:56:48,880
a quiet personality can turn into a ghost and act cruel and creepy true man with

1077
00:56:48,880 --> 00:56:53,540
quiet personality Jeffrey Dahmer every time I think I got a quiet personality

1078
00:56:53,540 --> 00:56:57,740
number four is changeling okay and this is changed into a wheelchair this is

1079
00:56:57,740 --> 00:57:01,500
this picture this is a crop of the movie poster for the movie the changeling I

1080
00:57:01,500 --> 00:57:05,980
wish I could not change my late Scott that is not I wish I could change my

1081
00:57:05,980 --> 00:57:11,320
I wish I could change my make it fucking to make it wider. Cangeling is one

1082
00:57:11,320 --> 00:57:15,320
creepy ghost next change. Changeling appearing as a substitute. If a child

1083
00:57:15,320 --> 00:57:17,640
stolen by supernatural beings as a meal

1084
00:57:17,640 --> 00:57:19,240
still

1085
00:57:19,240 --> 00:57:21,540
as a meal

1086
00:57:21,540 --> 00:57:26,040
physical shape is identical to the stolen children, but has a slightly

1087
00:57:26,040 --> 00:57:29,680
different behavior be Baral a time later. Changeling would be catastrophic

1088
00:57:29,680 --> 00:57:32,740
and continues to do so would cost the lives of the people who are around him.

1089
00:57:32,760 --> 00:57:36,160
So a changeling is a clone, or a shapeshifter.

1090
00:57:36,160 --> 00:57:39,280
- Yeah, a clone of a, it's like when fairies steal a--

1091
00:57:39,280 --> 00:57:41,160
- Keep throwing peopleistic things it could be.

1092
00:57:41,160 --> 00:57:43,080
- When fairies steal a baby and then they leave

1093
00:57:43,080 --> 00:57:45,800
a one that's a clone in its place that's evil.

1094
00:57:45,800 --> 00:57:46,760
- Really? - Yeah.

1095
00:57:46,760 --> 00:57:48,080
- I didn't know that. - Yeah.

1096
00:57:48,080 --> 00:57:48,920
- Oh wow.

1097
00:57:48,920 --> 00:57:51,040
- It's old, like, I wanna say it's Irish.

1098
00:57:51,040 --> 00:57:53,400
- Does that still happen or is it like cured,

1099
00:57:53,400 --> 00:57:54,600
like smallpox?

1100
00:57:54,600 --> 00:57:55,480
- I don't know.

1101
00:57:55,480 --> 00:57:56,320
- Oh, okay.

1102
00:57:56,320 --> 00:57:57,680
- I feel like it's probably one of those things

1103
00:57:57,680 --> 00:58:00,920
that happens rarely, but we have a vaccine against it now.

1104
00:58:00,920 --> 00:58:01,960
Like the black plague.

1105
00:58:01,960 --> 00:58:04,240
Number three is Yuri.

1106
00:58:04,240 --> 00:58:05,080
- Yuri.

1107
00:58:05,080 --> 00:58:07,280
- Behind the beauty of the Japanese state

1108
00:58:07,280 --> 00:58:10,080
turned out to save the mythical story very creepy.

1109
00:58:10,080 --> 00:58:12,240
One of them is a ghost named Yuri.

1110
00:58:12,240 --> 00:58:14,400
Yuri is a ghost who is described as the woman

1111
00:58:14,400 --> 00:58:16,600
who has pale skin and long hair and unkempt

1112
00:58:16,600 --> 00:58:20,640
and runs smack float surrounded by fireballs blazing.

1113
00:58:20,640 --> 00:58:22,880
It is said that Yuri is the incarnation

1114
00:58:22,880 --> 00:58:25,320
of the women who avenge his death.

1115
00:58:25,320 --> 00:58:29,000
- Wow, she runs smack float surrounded by fireballs blazing?

1116
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:30,360
- Listen, I know women who run,

1117
00:58:30,360 --> 00:58:31,940
I know women who smack, right?

1118
00:58:31,940 --> 00:58:34,280
but we float surrounded by fireballs blazing.

1119
00:58:34,280 --> 00:58:37,220
I mean, that's reserved for kind of a dark phoenix.

1120
00:58:37,220 --> 00:58:38,060
- Yeah.

1121
00:58:38,060 --> 00:58:39,440
- Sounds like a Pokemon.

1122
00:58:39,440 --> 00:58:40,280
- Yeah.

1123
00:58:40,280 --> 00:58:43,520
- Or a video game enemy of some type.

1124
00:58:43,520 --> 00:58:44,360
- Number two--

1125
00:58:44,360 --> 00:58:45,680
- Pokemon are the enemy in the game.

1126
00:58:45,680 --> 00:58:46,520
- Oh, that's true.

1127
00:58:46,520 --> 00:58:47,980
That's a good point.

1128
00:58:47,980 --> 00:58:48,820
- But it's made a different enemy.

1129
00:58:48,820 --> 00:58:49,660
- You know what they should give you?

1130
00:58:49,660 --> 00:58:51,240
You should be able to go into the Pokemon games

1131
00:58:51,240 --> 00:58:55,880
with a riding lawnmower, John Deere.

1132
00:58:55,880 --> 00:58:57,880
Just fucking obliterate him.

1133
00:58:57,880 --> 00:58:58,720
- Yeah.

1134
00:58:58,720 --> 00:58:59,560
- Tear that--

1135
00:58:59,560 --> 00:59:00,600
- I mean, yeah, you're tearing down the grass.

1136
00:59:00,600 --> 00:59:01,680
- Just get that grass.

1137
00:59:01,680 --> 00:59:04,260
I don't want that grass boy.

1138
00:59:04,260 --> 00:59:05,260
Uh huh.

1139
00:59:05,260 --> 00:59:06,260
Right?

1140
00:59:06,260 --> 00:59:08,520
And you should also have a fucking, you should be able to fill, like the office, you should

1141
00:59:08,520 --> 00:59:09,680
be able to fill the caves with jelly.

1142
00:59:09,680 --> 00:59:16,040
I should have one of those, the McDonald's machines they use on the male chickens, or

1143
00:59:16,040 --> 00:59:20,480
on the chicks or whatever, and I have that and I'm catching every Pokemon in the area,

1144
00:59:20,480 --> 00:59:23,760
and on the route, I'm walking around, I'm catching every Pokemon, they're all watching

1145
00:59:23,760 --> 00:59:24,760
me catch every Pokemon.

1146
00:59:24,760 --> 00:59:26,760
I have a giant bag full of Pokeballs.

1147
00:59:26,760 --> 00:59:30,600
I'm walking back to my house, I have a big plate glass window that they can see, I'm

1148
00:59:30,600 --> 00:59:32,740
bloated, just dropping all the Pokeballs in that machine.

1149
00:59:32,740 --> 00:59:33,580
- Of course. - They're like,

1150
00:59:33,580 --> 00:59:35,620
"You have to stop, we wanna catch some Pokemon too."

1151
00:59:35,620 --> 00:59:37,320
And I'm like, "You gotta be faster."

1152
00:59:37,320 --> 00:59:38,160
- That's right. - Yeah.

1153
00:59:38,160 --> 00:59:39,380
- I caught 'em all. - I can do, they're mine,

1154
00:59:39,380 --> 00:59:40,620
I can do what I want with them.

1155
00:59:40,620 --> 00:59:43,180
- I got a shiny Absol.

1156
00:59:43,180 --> 00:59:45,820
- I wanna find the Mr. Mime, speaking of nests,

1157
00:59:45,820 --> 00:59:48,260
I wanna find the Mr. Mime nest or the Mr. Mime hill

1158
00:59:48,260 --> 00:59:50,900
and I wanna pour molten lava down there.

1159
00:59:50,900 --> 00:59:52,820
- Yeah. - And create a statue.

1160
00:59:52,820 --> 00:59:54,260
- I would love-- - With burning bodies.

1161
00:59:54,260 --> 00:59:56,340
- I would love to pull the legs off a Mr. Mime.

1162
00:59:56,340 --> 00:59:57,980
- Me too, imagine the Roto Chicks

1163
00:59:57,980 --> 00:59:59,300
in the Pokemon universe, right?

1164
00:59:59,300 --> 01:00:00,140
- Oh my God.

1165
01:00:00,140 --> 01:00:05,240
what a Mr. Mime tastes like probably like cotton candy. It's so fucking good. Yeah, gotta be good. So good.

1166
01:00:05,240 --> 01:00:12,080
Yeah. Those hairs. The hair on the head would taste so good.

1167
01:00:12,080 --> 01:00:20,080
Number two, Rougarou. Rougarou alone is as an ordinary man who led a normal

1168
01:00:20,080 --> 01:00:25,880
life like most people until adulthood then signed normal nya nya up here. The

1169
01:00:25,880 --> 01:00:29,880
The signs that he will continue to feel hungry and then eat.

1170
01:00:29,880 --> 01:00:31,880
This is written in complete normal English Patrick is just having trouble reading it.

1171
01:00:31,880 --> 01:00:35,880
Whatever Ackman until the Sat-nya.

1172
01:00:35,880 --> 01:00:38,880
He will feed on humans as well.

1173
01:00:38,880 --> 01:00:43,880
Sometimes he would be camouflaged as an ordinary human being as a way to trap prey and ultimately

1174
01:00:43,880 --> 01:00:46,880
will make food as a remedy against hunger.

1175
01:00:46,880 --> 01:00:47,880
Food is a remedy for hunger.

1176
01:00:47,880 --> 01:00:48,880
That is true.

1177
01:00:48,880 --> 01:00:49,880
I never thought of that.

1178
01:00:49,880 --> 01:00:50,880
I didn't think about that either.

1179
01:00:50,880 --> 01:00:51,880
Hunger is an affliction.

1180
01:00:51,880 --> 01:00:52,880
Yeah.

1181
01:00:52,880 --> 01:00:53,880
Like food is the remedy.

1182
01:00:53,880 --> 01:00:54,880
Yeah, exactly.

1183
01:00:54,880 --> 01:00:56,140
- That makes sense to me too.

1184
01:00:56,140 --> 01:00:58,100
- Food has gotta be hunger's remedy.

1185
01:00:58,100 --> 01:01:00,140
- Alright, any guesses on what number one is?

1186
01:01:00,140 --> 01:01:01,440
I just scrolled down and saw it.

1187
01:01:01,440 --> 01:01:02,280
- Plants.

1188
01:01:02,280 --> 01:01:05,700
What is this list again?

1189
01:01:05,700 --> 01:01:07,640
- Top 10 most creepy ghost in world.

1190
01:01:07,640 --> 01:01:10,860
- That's gotta be fucking the devil.

1191
01:01:10,860 --> 01:01:11,700
- It's zombie.

1192
01:01:11,700 --> 01:01:13,620
- Oh, I said the zombie's enemy.

1193
01:01:13,620 --> 01:01:14,460
- It's like the same dude.

1194
01:01:14,460 --> 01:01:16,100
Alright, zombie's not a ghost, alright?

1195
01:01:16,100 --> 01:01:19,180
- Alright, zombies are very famous in western countries.

1196
01:01:19,180 --> 01:01:22,120
Figure undead rising from the grave is certainly very scary.

1197
01:01:22,120 --> 01:01:23,540
No wonder if the devil, this one,

1198
01:01:23,540 --> 01:01:26,420
being one of the most frightening demon world.

1199
01:01:26,420 --> 01:01:28,500
Zombie is also widely used as inspiration

1200
01:01:28,500 --> 01:01:29,820
for the film "Overseas."

1201
01:01:29,820 --> 01:01:31,980
Terrible shape and Degan blood stains

1202
01:01:31,980 --> 01:01:33,020
that exist throughout the body

1203
01:01:33,020 --> 01:01:34,700
makes it more scary zombie.

1204
01:01:34,700 --> 01:01:37,580
Though walking with a slow, zombies are very dangerous.

1205
01:01:37,580 --> 01:01:39,620
This is because the zombies constantly hungry

1206
01:01:39,620 --> 01:01:42,620
and will salulu try to eat any creature they encountered.

1207
01:01:42,620 --> 01:01:44,260
- Did you, have you guys seen those videos

1208
01:01:44,260 --> 01:01:46,860
of these fucking deer that have this crazy disease

1209
01:01:46,860 --> 01:01:49,380
that makes them just spin in circles like zombies?

1210
01:01:49,380 --> 01:01:51,140
- That sounds crazy. - No, I didn't see that.

1211
01:01:51,140 --> 01:01:56,220
like get some some it's like some brain-eating disease and eventually it

1212
01:01:56,220 --> 01:01:59,020
gets to the point where they just like start running in circles till they die.

1213
01:01:59,020 --> 01:02:03,020
That's nuts. I love stuff like that. That is cool. And then the thing the fungus that takes

1214
01:02:03,020 --> 01:02:06,620
over the bugs or whatever. Cordyceps. Yeah the cordyceps those are cool. Yeah.

1215
01:02:06,620 --> 01:02:10,580
That's the fungus that grows in ants brains and it makes them climb up to high

1216
01:02:10,580 --> 01:02:14,420
places and then it explodes their heads to shoot the spores out. I cannot wait

1217
01:02:14,420 --> 01:02:18,180
until something like that evolves into humans. It's COVID. I actually

1218
01:02:18,180 --> 01:02:21,660
think it's COVID. I actually think it's COVID. There's one comment on this list

1219
01:02:21,660 --> 01:02:26,100
under posting commentar if anyone wants to read it here from Valky Padro.

1220
01:02:26,100 --> 01:02:30,940
A casino will not allow players to gamble or play slots. Dr. CMD, if you enjoy

1221
01:02:30,940 --> 01:02:37,060
playing online Chinese slots with a friend... That's not Chinese. That's Korean.

1222
01:02:37,060 --> 01:02:42,260
Well, I'm not wearing my glasses.

1223
01:02:42,260 --> 01:02:46,740
I was just going to let it happen.

1224
01:02:46,740 --> 01:02:53,460
There is Korean, always Korean, something you can do when you, Korean, stay at your hotel.

1225
01:02:53,460 --> 01:02:56,820
In our opinion, and then I think there's more.

1226
01:02:56,820 --> 01:02:57,820
Ballas.

1227
01:02:57,820 --> 01:02:58,820
No.

1228
01:02:58,820 --> 01:02:59,820
That's not more?

1229
01:02:59,820 --> 01:03:00,820
No.

1230
01:03:00,820 --> 01:03:01,820
That's not, the ballas doesn't mean more?

1231
01:03:01,820 --> 01:03:05,500
No, it just says ballas and you click on it, it scrolls to the bottom of the page.

1232
01:03:05,500 --> 01:03:06,500
Oh, okay.

1233
01:03:06,500 --> 01:03:07,500
Well, there's posting llama there.

1234
01:03:07,500 --> 01:03:08,740
What is posting llama?

1235
01:03:08,740 --> 01:03:09,740
What?

1236
01:03:09,740 --> 01:03:11,740

01:03:15,100 --> 01:03:17,420
Top 10 unique staircase ideas for you.

1239
01:03:17,420 --> 01:03:22,540
What do you say in the world? Staircase hanging? Such stair design suitable for minimalist home? That's beautiful.

1240
01:03:22,540 --> 01:03:25,740
Staircase shaped tree bring natural feel unique and interesting.

1241
01:03:25,740 --> 01:03:30,140
Flower petal staircase the steps were like flower petals when seen from above.

1242
01:03:30,140 --> 01:03:33,660
Stairs once library space under the stairs turn into a bookshelf.

1243
01:03:33,660 --> 01:03:40,060
Staircase tilted this ladder is dangerous for children and the elderly.

1244
01:03:40,060 --> 01:03:42,060
Why is it making the top 10 then?

1245
01:03:42,060 --> 01:03:44,060
Yeah, I guess it's interesting.

1246
01:03:44,060 --> 01:03:46,060
It is interesting.

1247
01:03:46,060 --> 01:03:48,060
The staircase from another world. Unique.

1248
01:03:48,060 --> 01:03:50,060
Flues as it appears from another world. Penetrating the

1249
01:03:50,060 --> 01:03:52,060
surface of the floor while the stairs look very clear.

1250
01:03:52,060 --> 01:03:54,060
