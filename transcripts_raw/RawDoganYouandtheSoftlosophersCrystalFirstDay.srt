1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Last trebuchet village arc was Tales from the Seabomb, End of the World, Sin Bad, Virtue Good, Lady Better.

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Which was supposed to be an adventure to realms deep, the supposed end of the world, in order to rescue Solvin the Frog from his death in the terrifying realm, the one you caused.

3
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:29,560
You'd explore the islands of the virtue good archipelago, Archipelago? Archipelago? Archipelago.

4
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:35,600
Learn more about the creatures that live there, both native and colonized by the Terrafire Kingdom,

5
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:41,040
visiting port towns that hinted at incredible strange lands and adventures unknown to you or

6
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:46,720
anyone within the kingdom. Instead, you hate Sullivan and decided to try to sail as far

7
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:48,820
away from him as possible.

8
00:00:48,820 --> 00:00:53,000
The epic joke would have been that because the world is round, and nobody knows that,

9
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,840
you would have found your way to the end of the world either way, and therefore to Sullivan.

10
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:03,440
However, instead, Patrick Yodar, Evil Stievel, and Rod Doge and you the Dirt Goblin, the

11
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:08,960
original crew, encountered world pools, hot babes, strange runes and witches, beasts and

12
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:14,680
Spongebob Islands, fleshy submarines, death, and vanishing acts.

13
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:21,840
Patrick learned of his uncle/father, Trunchbull's, past as a member of a pirate crew,

14
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:27,800
60 tricksters eating chicky tinders and their mixing genders with their 120 fingers,

15
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:31,480
and a maroon placed on his mother who lived on Hot Babe Island.

16
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:36,240
That killed her when Patrick tried to speak with her about some sort of truth,

17
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:41,480
a truth she kept long buried, that likely will die with her.

18
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:44,480
And then Patrick died soon after that.

19
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:49,480
But not before he helped to create mud marks from the corpse of his mother, himself, and a couple of ugly women.

20
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:55,480
The goal became to vibe mud marks, and the only place to do that would be the Berry Berry Academy.

21
00:01:55,480 --> 00:02:02,480
In honor of Patrick, they would do so. And also because that would be funny for you guys to do.

22
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:13,480
Once the now two heroes were set on a journey, a mysterious massive yethound chased you across the sea,

23
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:18,480
and that became easier to avoid once Evil Ndoga invited Chuggie the Singing Submarine to their party,

24
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:26,480
and sailed within him, or, they were inside of his body, and they went through the sea.

25
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:32,400
A couple other adventure-y moments happened until they reached Port Los Beriberi, a port

26
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:38,280
town where they can get entry to the academy if they knew the right people.

27
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:44,620
They stumbled on one of those people, Condoleezza Carlo, a powerful, psychopathic warlock who

28
00:02:44,620 --> 00:02:49,640
lives in a lighthouse off the coast of Beriberi and tricks sailors into crashing their ships

29
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:51,600
and robbing them of their goods.

30
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:56,080
He said he'd help our heroes become academy professors so they could vive mud marks if

31
00:02:56,080 --> 00:03:02,080
they investigated the Popo Tower at the southern tip of the Terrifier Kingdom, where, apparently,

32
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:06,400
Stickyfingers was headed.

33
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:12,000
Stickyfingers at this point was the leader of the Thieves' Guild, or originally was the

34
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,560
leader of the Thieves' Guild in the Terrifier Kingdom, but after King Nardwuar's madness

35
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:22,060
subsided and people started to doubt his ability to rule, he rose in rank, filled in some sort

36
00:03:22,060 --> 00:03:26,560
of void there, became a more... part of the kingdom in a more official capacity as a

37
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:31,360
powerful intelligence organization, leader of a powerful intelligence

38
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:38,740
organization. Sticky Fingers was also a part of Trunchbull's crew, the 60

39
00:03:38,740 --> 00:03:43,140
tricksters eating Chicky Tinders crew, and may have had answers about

40
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:49,420
Patrick's origin and why his mother died, and may have even caused it, it's unclear.

41
00:03:49,420 --> 00:03:53,820
However, to get any of these questions answered, they'd have to meet with him, but once they

42
00:03:53,820 --> 00:04:01,820
reached the Popo Tower and scaled it, our heroes came face to face with a dead Sticky Fingers,

43
00:04:01,820 --> 00:04:09,580
who died in a fray because of an incredible battle between a massive, harpy, bird-like

44
00:04:09,580 --> 00:04:14,060
woman and a ghost or spirit of some kind that resembled the police, the virtuous god of

45
00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:19,980
good that had been expelled from the land by the Terrifier, the god of evil.

46
00:04:19,980 --> 00:04:22,340
Sticky Fingers died in that fray, right?

47
00:04:22,340 --> 00:04:27,340
And after the harpy was bested by the police, Evil Stevel, for some reason, looked beyond

48
00:04:27,340 --> 00:04:33,860
the horizon across the white fog that surrounds the Terrifier kingdom and vanished.

49
00:04:33,860 --> 00:04:38,180
And it's unclear exactly where, and some of that might be answered in this campaign, most

50
00:04:38,180 --> 00:04:41,380
likely in another one.

51
00:04:41,380 --> 00:04:47,180
But Dogen believes he's dead, and Chuggie exploded.

52
00:04:47,180 --> 00:04:52,240
And so Dogen was all alone, and kind of shell-shocked from the whole experience.

53
00:04:52,240 --> 00:05:00,860
Now other loose ends that have yet to be tied up are out there and are progressing.

54
00:05:00,860 --> 00:05:05,560
And you guys will learn more about them within this campaign.

55
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:09,780
I'll try to find organic ways to sprinkle in those details about what's going on in the

56
00:05:09,780 --> 00:05:10,780
outside world.

57
00:05:10,780 --> 00:05:14,980
to build that into the story here.

58
00:05:14,980 --> 00:05:22,740
But it's only going to show up if there's, you know, some remote curiosity about it.

59
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:28,020
But yeah, that's what happened in the last campaign more or less.

60
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:33,300
So...

61
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:41,260
Marlon Rees is a hardy tiefling who works in the town of Wayneswood just outside of the

62
00:05:41,260 --> 00:05:44,060
academy, the Berryberry Academy.

63
00:05:44,060 --> 00:05:48,060
His daughter, Regatta Rees, is a 12th year student there, set to graduate and join an

64
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:53,180
advisory council to a lord in the dirtlands just up north.

65
00:05:53,180 --> 00:05:58,020
Regatta's magical prowess meant she could get a near full ride to the academy, provided

66
00:05:58,020 --> 00:06:02,540
Marlon worked at the crystal mines every day for 12 hours with no breaks.

67
00:06:02,540 --> 00:06:04,900
So Marlin did just that.

68
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:09,100
Marlin didn't have a knack for magic, he could barely cast an alert spell, crucial to his

69
00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:10,100
mining work.

70
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:14,940
But he was strong, spending over a decade in the Klutzes, a now dwindling monster hunter

71
00:06:14,940 --> 00:06:15,940
guild.

72
00:06:15,940 --> 00:06:20,740
And he was crafty, fashioning his leather belt with a sigil his daughter enchanted to rattle

73
00:06:20,740 --> 00:06:23,020
in the instance of a cave-in.

74
00:06:23,020 --> 00:06:28,020
He was lucky he could count on her, and when she finally leaves the academy, the money she'll

75
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:33,140
send back from the dirtlands should provide him something resembling retirement.

76
00:06:33,140 --> 00:06:39,540
Marlon Rees has worked Mine 24A for over 30 years, and he has never been deeper in the

77
00:06:39,540 --> 00:06:41,780
mine than he is now.

78
00:06:41,780 --> 00:06:46,240
His headlamp, powered by one of the many crystals mined by the workers like him, is augmented

79
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:50,740
with a brighter light that can also sense hostility or precariousness as the cone of

80
00:06:50,740 --> 00:06:54,900
light moves across the surface, creating a faint outline of alternating colors around

81
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:57,660
lit objects that indicate levels of danger.

82
00:06:57,660 --> 00:07:02,820
It assesses the familiarity with a territory or object, it contains an index for extreme

83
00:07:02,820 --> 00:07:07,020
motion and temperature, as well as the will of anything that is lit, an estimation of

84
00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:08,020
it.

85
00:07:08,020 --> 00:07:12,780
It's an incredibly complex sigil, another of Rigatta's inventions, one that got her

86
00:07:12,780 --> 00:07:16,180
into the academy in the first place at the age of ten.

87
00:07:16,180 --> 00:07:22,260
Despite Beriberi Academy's distaste for her family's ability to pay admission, or inability,

88
00:07:22,260 --> 00:07:25,820
Rigatta's aptitude simply could not be denied.

89
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:29,380
This far down the mine, Marlin has seen an outline of light orange around most of the

90
00:07:29,380 --> 00:07:36,300
cliffs and jagged rock scattered, jutting about, no longer contained by a proper mining tunnel.

91
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:40,100
The color likely relates to a combination of unfamiliarity of the territory and the

92
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:42,500
sharp decline as Marlin continues his descent.

93
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:47,740
He uses his long, strong tiefling tail to help stabilize his climb, using his claws to grip

94
00:07:47,740 --> 00:07:49,380
the sides of the rock face.

95
00:07:49,380 --> 00:07:55,780
Meanwhile, a container, given to him by the Pleasureman Lord, clanked against his belt.

96
00:07:55,780 --> 00:08:00,180
occasionally interrupting his footing, but he made do, shifting his body and readjusting

97
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:03,540
his weight, looking for the occasional surface that could almost pass as a platform where

98
00:08:03,540 --> 00:08:08,900
there's not such a risk of each one crumbling beneath his heavy boots.

99
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:13,060
His years fighting monsters and mining, along with his being a tiefling, made his hands

100
00:08:13,060 --> 00:08:19,180
rough, his body strong, but also his bones beaten and himself fatigued.

101
00:08:19,180 --> 00:08:21,940
Still he made his way down, further and further.

102
00:08:21,940 --> 00:08:23,900
This was his way out, after all.

103
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:27,140
You'd never have to work a day in these damned mines again.

104
00:08:27,140 --> 00:08:30,860
He just needs to find a soft crystal.

105
00:08:30,860 --> 00:08:35,660
And now we zoom out of this little mine story.

106
00:08:35,660 --> 00:08:36,660
Minecraft story mode.

107
00:08:36,660 --> 00:08:37,660
Minecraft story.

108
00:08:37,660 --> 00:08:38,660
You're doing the Minecraft story mode.

109
00:08:38,660 --> 00:08:41,780
You literally said killing monsters and mining.

110
00:08:41,780 --> 00:08:49,260
And we look now above at the Beriberi Academy.

111
00:08:49,260 --> 00:08:53,880
From the sky above the Terrafire Kingdom, were you to look down on E-Bomb, you'd see

112
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:58,920
a landmass of browns, whites, grays, and tans, the static blues of the sea, all of it cut

113
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:03,920
off by a vast, churning, otherworldly white fog. And then, on the southernmost part of

114
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:10,920
the landmass, a sharp, bright, glittering gleam of azure, twinkling pockmarks upon the earth.

115
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:15,840
Diving through the clouds, these reveal themselves to be the famous beriberi crystals, massive

116
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:20,960
deposits that hover just above the green sloping spires that make up the academy, lighting the

117
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:25,600
manicured garden below. The Academy itself sits atop a pond, seemingly hovering above

118
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:31,000
nothing. Any member of the Academy must pass an initial test of identifying the interplanar

119
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:36,140
floor that rests above the water. Once they do, they are able to walk atop of it, between

120
00:09:36,140 --> 00:09:40,160
the buildings. Everyone else can take the magically powered skiffs that litter the pond

121
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:44,640
and help the non-magical staff and visitors navigate the Academy.

122
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:49,400
The Beriberi Academy's De Minestrone, the main building at the center of the Minestrone

123
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:53,960
Pond has a large atrium and auditorium that links to the four massive spires that connect

124
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:55,760
via alabaster bridges.

125
00:09:55,760 --> 00:10:01,680
Each of the four spires that make up the castle, the minestrone, represents one of the four

126
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:03,100
houses.

127
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:08,080
House Birdo, House Megabat, House Giant, and House Kaiju Manji.

128
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:12,480
They house the students and faculty and have classes that specialize in magics often associated

129
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:13,900
with each house.

130
00:10:13,900 --> 00:10:18,600
The four spires that make up the Dei Minestrone contain elevators for non-magic users, but

131
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:22,480
but is otherwise largely composed of rapidly changing chutes and ladders that magical students

132
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:27,420
and faculty alike must anticipate and navigate to get from one location to the next.

133
00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:30,880
The other buildings surrounding the academy include a center of combat, athletics, and

134
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:38,440
dangerous magics, a greenhouse, alchemical lab, and runic experimentation facility, artificer

135
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:43,880
workshop, a creature sanctuary, and a rotating crop farm, grain storage, and warehouse for

136
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:46,080
non-magical creatures.

137
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:50,120
There are varying observatories and chambers that exist amongst and atop the spires, all

138
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:54,240
outfitted to equip any aspiring witches, wizards, warlocks, and the like with whatever they need

139
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:55,960
to excel.

140
00:10:55,960 --> 00:11:00,800
We return to the Dei Minestrone, that main building, and climb the Kaiju Manji spire.

141
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:05,200
We pass by all manner of pervy portraits, goofy ghosts, and weirdy cantrips, and make

142
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:09,600
furniture dance and faculty flail, and we finally reach the dormitory of House Kaiju

143
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:11,920
Manji.

144
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:16,900
Along the walls are vast, beastly carvings of unknowable monstrosities, and if you stare

145
00:11:16,900 --> 00:11:18,640
too long you'll go mad.

146
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:22,000
That is, unless you have been selected to join the house.

147
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:28,320
Then these kaiju manji of yore give you a perverse comfort and hazy serenity, a oneness.

148
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:31,920
But none of you have been sorted yet into the house.

149
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:40,440
Dogen, you sit in the iron, dendritic chairs in front of an everlasting black fire.

150
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:49,040
chairs what no like looks like no looks like dander no it's not it's like looks

151
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:59,320
like tree branches or dandruff dendritic Denzel you ponder I sit as a dandruff

152
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:03,400
chair these days I've been you ponder damn I'm sorry to hear that me too you

153
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:09,800
ponder how did I get here have I really lost Patrick and evil who was that guy

154
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:14,000
Well, you can say this all better yourself.

155
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Who is that guy?

156
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Who's that guy?

157
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,600
I don't know that I have questioned that question in my intro.

158
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:20,600
Where are my friends and who's that guy?

159
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:23,600
What in the hell is that?

160
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:26,600
Well, it finally happened.

161
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:31,400
I, Dogen the Diploma Goblin, am in big trouble.

162
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:36,800
After arriving at Beriberi Academy and vibing Quadra Mud Marks, I felt a deep void in my

163
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:40,280
my life, a void created by the loss of Evil Stievel

164
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:42,640
and whatever that sexual submarine's name was

165
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:44,320
that I can't remember at all.

166
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:48,320
I was living like a pig, sleeping 'til the sundial

167
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:50,880
said, "Aye, aye, aye," and eating depression meals

168
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:53,260
like hard-boiled quail eggs and whole roast pig

169
00:12:53,260 --> 00:12:55,040
with apple in its mouth.

170
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:57,880
But then, I pulled myself up by my bootstraps

171
00:12:57,880 --> 00:12:58,960
and landed a job.

172
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:01,680
That's right, I became a teacher at the academy.

173
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:04,200
I taught sex magic for two years.

174
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:06,080
My name was hard for my students to pronounce,

175
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:08,200
So they called me Mr. D.

176
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:11,080
These were the best years of my little green life.

177
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:13,720
But then I got in trouble.

178
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:16,560
See, the headmaster, Mr. Eat Your Pussy Up,

179
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:17,800
found something out.

180
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:19,800
Not only did he find out that I don't have

181
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:22,380
the proper credentials to be teaching sex magic,

182
00:13:22,380 --> 00:13:24,720
but he found out that there isn't even such a thing

183
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:25,980
as sex magic.

184
00:13:25,980 --> 00:13:27,640
So he suspended me.

185
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:29,640
Me, Mr. D.

186
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:32,480
And it turns out there's only one way to get my job back,

187
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:34,360
and that's to receive the proper education

188
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:35,440
to qualify me for it.

189
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:38,400
In short, I need a diploma.

190
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:41,060
So now, after years of creating hundreds of enemies

191
00:13:41,060 --> 00:13:42,680
in the student body through harsh grading,

192
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:45,100
inappropriate comments, and corporeal punishment,

193
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:47,840
I've been forced to enroll in Berry Berry Academy

194
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:49,680
as a first year.

195
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:51,100
I'm so nervous.

196
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:53,240
What will my school career bring?

197
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:55,560
Do I need to bring my backpack tomorrow?

198
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:56,780
Without a steady paycheck,

199
00:13:56,780 --> 00:13:59,680
I can already feel myself slipping back into depression.

200
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:02,020
The only thing that could save me at this point

201
00:14:02,020 --> 00:14:03,680
is a core friend group.

202
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:06,780
- Wow, that's great.

203
00:14:06,780 --> 00:14:10,400
- And also I'm wearing, they say dress for the job you want,

204
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:11,280
not the job you have.

205
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:13,680
So first day of school, cap and gown.

206
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:15,600
- Damn, I like that.

207
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:20,360
- And so Dogen, you sit in the Kaiju Manji house,

208
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:22,960
even though you don't belong to the house yet.

209
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:26,760
Now the reason for that is because you're still good friends

210
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:28,180
with Condoleezza Carlo,

211
00:14:28,180 --> 00:14:33,320
a warlock who helped you guys in the last campaign.

212
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:36,560
And I will also have to, I just realized this,

213
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:38,280
I didn't want to take up too much time,

214
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:41,700
but I will also give a last time on the campaign.

215
00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:45,580
Probably just realized we just jumped right into that.

216
00:14:45,580 --> 00:14:49,640
So I will do that as well, but we'll get there.

217
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:50,480
- It's been a minute.

218
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:51,720
- Yeah, it's been a minute.

219
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:54,140
So Condoleezza Carlo, who's a warlock,

220
00:14:54,140 --> 00:14:57,520
who helped you guys towards the end of the last campaign,

221
00:14:57,520 --> 00:14:59,440
he helped get you the job.

222
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:03,200
He is friends, or at least seems to know

223
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:08,200
the head of the Kaiju Manji house, who is...

224
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:12,280
Oh man, I have so many fucking notes.

225
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:14,240
Make sure I'm looking at the right ones.

226
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:20,040
The head of the Kaiju Manji house, who is...

227
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:25,140
Okay, I need to have like seven different windows.

228
00:15:25,140 --> 00:15:28,320
Where are you, buddy?

229
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:30,920
Oh, geez.

230
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:32,280
Gaston, yes!

231
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:34,520
Okay, yeah, I remember this. Gaston.

232
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:38,560
And so he was able to squeeze you in here.

233
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:40,560
You and Mud Marks are here too.

234
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:44,560
And so Mud Marks, if you recall, is made up of,

235
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:47,760
I believe, Patrick's head, his mother's head,

236
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:50,560
and two, like, sort of five out of ten women.

237
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:53,760
And the four of them together on top of a kind of a mud body,

238
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:55,560
and they look like the Marks brothers.

239
00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:57,560
And the whole point of the last campaign,

240
00:15:57,560 --> 00:15:59,560
besides trying to avoid Sullivan,

241
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:02,060
was eventually to vibe him.

242
00:16:02,060 --> 00:16:03,500
And you have vibed him.

243
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:06,860
And so, uh, yeah, he's, uh, he's there.

244
00:16:06,860 --> 00:16:07,680
Yeah.

245
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:12,260
To answer any of your questions, if you got them, you know, who is that guy?

246
00:16:12,260 --> 00:16:14,300
It's a Groucho Marx, right?

247
00:16:14,300 --> 00:16:16,260
Uh, wait, wait, hold on.

248
00:16:16,260 --> 00:16:16,780
Wait a minute.

249
00:16:16,780 --> 00:16:17,280
Wait a minute.

250
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:19,060
I shot an elephant in my pajamas.

251
00:16:19,060 --> 00:16:20,020
Why he was wearing my pajamas.

252
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:20,520
I don't know.

253
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:21,240
That's pretty.

254
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:21,860
That's all right.

255
00:16:21,860 --> 00:16:22,360
Right.

256
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:23,120
I mean, he got it.

257
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:23,720
Got it.

258
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:25,460
Chico, Chico, Chico, the marks.

259
00:16:25,460 --> 00:16:26,160
Right.

260
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:26,980
He sounded like it is.

261
00:16:26,980 --> 00:16:28,200
Yeah.

262
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:29,960
Okay.

263
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:30,720
All right.

264
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:33,200
It'll make more sense.

265
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:34,600
I'm seeing the vision.

266
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:39,960
Yeah, and so they're all kind of, they're bickering, "Zeppo's dead, his head just never worked

267
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:40,960
out."

268
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:45,560
And then Harpo once in a while will honk a horn.

269
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:46,560
Yeah.

270
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:53,320
But yeah, today will be the first day you're going to get your, you're going to get to

271
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:54,320
be-

272
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:55,320
I can't wait to get sorted.

273
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:56,320
The sorting ceremony.

274
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:58,320
I'm so excited to get sorted.

275
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:00,680
- But we'll sort of-- - I can't wait to go party, man.

276
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:02,800
- We'll zoom out from that,

277
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:05,680
and we'll introduce the two other characters,

278
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:08,360
and then I'll do a last time on this campaign.

279
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:12,200
So we're at the gates of,

280
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:14,680
where all the students are filing in from the Academy town.

281
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:16,880
They take these skiff boats provided to them

282
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:19,840
to get to the gates of the Academy,

283
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:22,800
and they're let in, they show their letter of admission,

284
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:24,760
their, you know, if you remember from the last one,

285
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:25,600
that was the whole thing,

286
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:27,400
was to be able to get that kind of letter

287
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:31,800
to get in there if you could, and they all have them.

288
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:36,800
And so I'd like to meet first our friend, the satyr.

289
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:43,480
- Okay, you hear, off camera.

290
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:46,880
- It's cutting out on Discord.

291
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:47,720
- Well, it's cutting out on my mic, bitch.

292
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:50,240
- I see you making a funny shape of your mouth.

293
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:51,780
- Clopping and clopping, okay?

294
00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:56,600
(laughing)

295
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:57,100
Okay.

296
00:17:57,100 --> 00:18:00,140
The name's Woody.

297
00:18:00,140 --> 00:18:03,460
I'm from a druid enclave up there in troll country.

298
00:18:03,460 --> 00:18:04,580
I'm a satyr.

299
00:18:04,580 --> 00:18:07,060
The whole neighborhood used to be satyrs.

300
00:18:07,060 --> 00:18:10,180
But then trolls started moving in and ruining the neighborhood.

301
00:18:10,180 --> 00:18:12,060
They listen to horrid music.

302
00:18:12,060 --> 00:18:13,740
And they stepped on me brother.

303
00:18:13,740 --> 00:18:16,000
And they stepped on me father.

304
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:19,460
Me mum's making me go to this school so I can get me business degree.

305
00:18:19,460 --> 00:18:20,780
Send coin back to mum.

306
00:18:20,780 --> 00:18:22,560
She actually brought me here.

307
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:24,460
I'm riding on her back right now.

308
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:28,880
I can feel a lump on her back, probably not so good.

309
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:34,680
I got selected by the academy because I got a 1900 on my SATYR.

310
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:36,920
School should be easy.

311
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:39,640
Doing card tricks and making a pencil turn to rubber?

312
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:41,400
Sounds fine by me.

313
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:45,880
I'm mostly here to attempt to have an inappropriate relationship with a teacher or ex-teacher,

314
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:47,880
especially a goblin.

315
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:56,240
Oi, I'm so proud of you.

316
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:57,760
I'm so proud of you Woody.

317
00:18:57,760 --> 00:18:59,160
I love you too, hon.

318
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:01,800
- I love you so much, I don't wanna leave.

319
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:04,600
- The only conversations they ever have with each other.

320
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:06,120
- I love you so much, mom.

321
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:07,800
I don't wanna leave yet.

322
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:09,920
I want you to come with me to school.

323
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:11,520
- I can't come with you to school.

324
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:13,200
- There's gold in my backyard.

325
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:14,040
- I love you.

326
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:15,360
- Fly on the wall, drop into a conversation

327
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:17,120
between a son and a mom and they're just going,

328
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:18,880
I love you so much, I love you.

329
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:19,800
- I love you.

330
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:21,640
- I love you so much, mom.

331
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:22,800
- I love you.

332
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:25,800
I wanna meet a girl just like you while I'm here at school.

333
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:26,800

We're all in this boat, and I'm sitting in the way back, and I'm making the boat is pretty much vertical

359
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:43,040
Because of where I'm sitting

00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:45,960

And I because I think that I have to introduce myself to everybody

365
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:06,920
And I pull a piece of paper out of my pocket, and I stand up

366
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:12,440

Am from the Goliath Kingdom and I like

371
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:35,440
Dark things and I like gothic things

372
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:40,600
Recently I learned that I have magic powers

373
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:44,840
And I'm going to do my best in school

374
00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:48,040

375
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:52,240

Actually quite nervous I'm 15 feet and I'm 15 years old right and

377
00:22:05,560 --> 00:22:07,560
And, um...

378
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:10,920
Is the whole school gonna be on a boat?

379
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:12,740
Or...

380
00:22:12,740 --> 00:22:14,780
Uh, yeah, you see one of the...

381
00:22:14,780 --> 00:22:15,280
Are we gonna be...

382
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:16,140
...one of the folks works the gate.

383
00:22:16,140 --> 00:22:18,600
Oh, no, we won't all be on a boat.

384
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:20,880
Um, there's an academy inside.

385
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:25,160
May I ask your magical discipline?

386
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:26,360
Your class.

387
00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:30,460
My class is first grade.

388
00:22:30,460 --> 00:22:31,620
Right.

389
00:22:31,620 --> 00:22:32,120
*laughter*

390
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:35,280
So, which type of magic do you...

391
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:40,280
- Okay, do you do, are you a wizard, a warlock?

392
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:42,480
- I'm Andre Behavoir.

393
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:44,260
- Yeah, we're gonna do this?

394
00:22:44,260 --> 00:22:49,720
- And I'm in the first grade, and I'm 15.

395
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:54,200
- So Andre Behavoir is a warlock.

396
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:58,600
- I am a warlock, I specialize in dark magic,

397
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:00,560
and necromancy and stuff.

398
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:06,600
- And also-- - My intelligence is six.

399
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:08,080
- Yeah, so that's part of what's happening here.

400
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:09,800
- That's why I'm in the first grade.

401
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:12,420
- And the-- - You have a bad brain.

402
00:23:12,420 --> 00:23:15,320
- The satyr, our satyr friend Woody

403
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:17,680
is a druid, a circle of the land.

404
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:19,040
- That's facts.

405
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:20,880
And plus I'm an acolyte.

406
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:22,240
- Yes, and an acolyte.

407
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:23,080
(laughing)

408
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:25,000
Some faith of some kind.

409
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:30,000
And Andre Behavoir is a warlock

410
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:34,360
who's a patron is a great old one,

411
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:38,080
and who's packed of the tome.

412
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:40,840
And yeah, you hear--

413
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:42,280
- And explain who my--

414
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:46,160
- Yeah, you hear inside your mind, you hear,

415
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:48,920
(mimics mumbling)

416
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:50,720
you know, that kind of like Doppler effect

417
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:52,440
of like hearing somebody talk into your mind

418
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:54,800
and then it sort of settles into something.

419
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:56,980
He goes, "Hey man!"

420
00:23:56,980 --> 00:23:57,960
- Hello, doing?

421
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:02,600
- Oh wow, I cannot get used to this.

422
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:03,760
Too weird.

423
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:08,440
- Dylan, it's my first day of school.

424
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:11,520
- Oh, okay, pretty cool, pretty cool, pretty cool.

425
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:17,520
You're telling me that Dylan is a infinite being

426
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:18,520
that is on other planets?

427
00:24:18,520 --> 00:24:22,560
- Dylan, Patches and I decided that the star

428
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:24,760
in Dylan's shirt allows him to communicate

429
00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:26,320
between every single world.

430
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:28,000
- Okay, so in-- - In Gun City.

431
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,620
- Is Dylan right now on Earth?

432
00:24:30,620 --> 00:24:33,680
Dylan is right now, yeah, Dylan's in a,

433
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:36,080
Dylan is in a Dylan's Candy Bar.

434
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:36,920
- Yeah.

435
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:37,760
(laughing)

436
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:38,580
- At the airport.

437
00:24:38,580 --> 00:24:39,580
- Talking to his shirt.

438
00:24:39,580 --> 00:24:43,000
Saying, "Oh no, yeah, the licorice, thanks."

439
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,960
- Oh wait, can you, I forgot me lunch, can you--

440
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:47,920
- He's walking down Fifth Avenue.

441
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:49,840
No, I'm sorry, I can't help you.

442
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:52,520
- You can't put the candy through your shirt

443
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:53,360
and give me some--

444
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:55,920
- No, I told you about this already.

445
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:56,760
It's not like that.

446
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:58,520
That would be pretty awesome though.

447
00:24:58,520 --> 00:25:01,720
- You can only communicate with me right.

448
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:03,680
- And give you powers.

449
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:07,160
- Oh, what about candy powers?

450
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:10,800
- Hey, maybe that school can teach you candy powers.

451
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:12,200
I'm fresh out.

452
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:13,180
- Oh right.

453
00:25:13,180 --> 00:25:17,880
Well, off to school then.

454
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:18,720
- Look, you're gonna do great.

455
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:23,720
- I step out of the boat and everyone flies by.

456
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:27,460
Every single part like like full like catapults back.

457
00:25:27,460 --> 00:25:31,220
They have to swim to the school but there is a piranha in the lake.

458
00:25:31,220 --> 00:25:32,540
What.

459
00:25:32,540 --> 00:25:35,020
Just one. No problem unless there's a whole.

460
00:25:35,020 --> 00:25:36,740
There's one piranha.

461
00:25:36,740 --> 00:25:37,780
There's one piranha.

462
00:25:37,780 --> 00:25:38,700
One piranha.

463
00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:39,700
But it's big.

464
00:25:39,700 --> 00:25:40,380
It's going to bite you.

465
00:25:40,380 --> 00:25:45,300
So when you guys all when you two walk into the school you're greeted by this

466
00:25:45,300 --> 00:25:51,000
an image that I will put in the discord of

467
00:25:51,860 --> 00:25:57,180
the academy of a beautiful fountain with these sort of large blue crystals floating above

468
00:25:57,180 --> 00:26:00,300
different objects inside of the place.

469
00:26:00,300 --> 00:26:05,220
Yeah, I guess, Jubia, if you want to pull that up, you could pull that up.

470
00:26:05,220 --> 00:26:10,380
I don't know how this works for you, but if not, I could just put it in the Discord.

471
00:26:10,380 --> 00:26:14,660
But you see the green sloping towers and the white bridges and all that.

472
00:26:14,660 --> 00:26:21,100
And as you walk through the fountain, you approach towards the entrance of the main building where

473
00:26:21,100 --> 00:26:24,060
you're being directed to go as you walk through the gardens.

474
00:26:24,060 --> 00:26:26,400
And it is that sort of,

475
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:32,460
there is, you see students walking on the water automatically

476
00:26:32,460 --> 00:26:35,140
and as you guys take your first hesitant steps,

477
00:26:35,140 --> 00:26:36,860
you realize you can as well.

478
00:26:36,860 --> 00:26:39,180
And that's part of why you're let into this academy

479
00:26:39,180 --> 00:26:40,340
is your ability to recognize

480
00:26:40,340 --> 00:26:43,100
these kinds of interplanar elements,

481
00:26:43,100 --> 00:26:46,540
these kinds of magical things that other people can't.

482
00:26:46,540 --> 00:26:48,980
And so you're able to walk along the water

483
00:26:48,980 --> 00:26:51,100
through the door into the auditorium,

484
00:26:51,100 --> 00:26:53,740
where we're gonna be introduced

485
00:26:53,740 --> 00:26:55,700
to the rest of your classmates,

486
00:26:55,700 --> 00:26:58,900
where you're gonna meet perhaps a new friend named--

487
00:26:58,900 --> 00:27:02,700
- And I know we're gonna meet a Draco Malfoy type.

488
00:27:02,700 --> 00:27:05,580
I know we're going to. - You got that right.

489
00:27:05,580 --> 00:27:06,420
- Don't tell me we're about to meet

490
00:27:06,420 --> 00:27:08,500
a motherfucking Deadly. - I'm gonna kill him on sight.

491
00:27:08,500 --> 00:27:11,740
I'm not even gonna let it get to that level.

492
00:27:11,740 --> 00:27:15,620
If he even seems a little blonde, I'm snapping his neck.

493
00:27:15,620 --> 00:27:17,660
I'm not even letting the rivalry blossom.

494
00:27:17,660 --> 00:27:18,700
- Nope.

495
00:27:18,700 --> 00:27:21,040
So when you guys enter into the auditorium

496
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:23,700
and you see all the, do you,

497
00:27:23,700 --> 00:27:30,900
do you guys meet each other as you walk in?

498
00:27:30,900 --> 00:27:33,040
Like how do you guys, I want you guys to tell me

499
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:33,880
how you meet. - I don't wanna meet them yet.

500
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:34,700
I don't wanna meet them yet.

501
00:27:34,700 --> 00:27:35,540
- You don't wanna meet them yet?

502
00:27:35,540 --> 00:27:36,680
You wanna send your own kind of thing?

503
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:41,220
- Well I feel like we shouldn't meet for a second, okay?

504
00:27:41,220 --> 00:27:42,060
- Yeah. - No.

505
00:27:42,060 --> 00:27:43,940
- There's no candy cart, we can take some kind of--

506
00:27:43,940 --> 00:27:46,300
- So you see some older girl students.

507
00:27:46,300 --> 00:27:49,460
- But that's the only way you become friends at Hogwarts.

508
00:27:49,460 --> 00:27:51,300
- All right, that's true. - That's true as fuck.

509
00:27:51,300 --> 00:27:54,220
(thunder rumbling)

510
00:27:54,220 --> 00:27:58,060
- I guess, wait, aren't I in a weird different place?

511
00:27:58,060 --> 00:28:00,040
- Well, you should have left by now

512
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:01,540
to go down to the auditorium.

513
00:28:01,540 --> 00:28:02,980
- Oh my God, I'm late. - What about this?

514
00:28:02,980 --> 00:28:07,500
What about, I'm trying to walk into the only non-magic door

515
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:15,100
and it's not big enough and it's blocking his exit.

516
00:28:15,180 --> 00:28:17,180
Mm-hmm whose exit

517
00:28:17,180 --> 00:28:21,720
Maybe I can maybe I'm late and I run in when everyone's already seated everyone

518
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:26,640
I'm gonna go ahead. I'm gonna go you do what you want. I'm gonna go sit in the front

519
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:33,400
The very front because I like audience interaction, and I want to maybe get crowd worked

520
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:36,140
I'm gonna go ahead. I'm also sitting in the front. I'm gonna go

521
00:28:36,140 --> 00:28:38,220
only

522
00:28:38,220 --> 00:28:40,620
and some hot wings to my table and

523
00:28:41,980 --> 00:28:47,080
I'm sitting directly in front of him you guys are sitting you guys are sitting right at the front

524
00:28:47,080 --> 00:28:50,000
You're the only people sitting right at the front every other seat is filled up

525
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:53,040
So the only place to sit is at the front and nobody wants to sit there

526
00:28:53,040 --> 00:29:00,680
Everyone already seeed and then everyone's sitting down and the guy gets on stage maybe even mm-hmm. Yeah, I'd like to turn to

527
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:09,200
What's his name again reservoir and Andre Andre behavior

528
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:16,160
Hey there, you big bubble. You like the front seat too, huh? Cold shot going on this event.

529
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:21,840
You called me a bubble? Yeah, you big bubbler. Look at you! You're all full of blubber.

530
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:27,520
You look like a damn troll. Are you a troll? I'm from...

531
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:30,680
Goliath Town.

532
00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:33,960
Goliath? Girl like a girl?

533
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:38,600
Like a beautiful girl.

534
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:41,240
It's well

535
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:47,580
I'm confused now. Oh you take a break and let's watch the show

536
00:29:47,580 --> 00:29:57,280
What do you have you like berries and stuff just the whole I got some hot wings bitch, I just told nice

537
00:29:57,280 --> 00:30:01,460
Oh, yeah, magical and I eat the whole table. Oh, yeah, it is very much like Harry Potter

538
00:30:01,460 --> 00:30:07,080
Sweet sweets and sweet treats are appearing on in front of you on the on the table and the long tables

539
00:30:08,280 --> 00:30:12,200
You see a non-magical,

540
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:14,600
see very tired non-magical catering staff

541
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:16,640
just like wheeling in shit.

542
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:18,680
- And turning into a chunky robot.

543
00:30:18,680 --> 00:30:23,280
- And yeah, and as you guys gather around,

544
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:26,640
oh yeah, Dogen, are you there

545
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:28,440
or are you running, rushing there late?

546
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:29,800
- I'm waiting, I'm waiting,

547
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:31,280
I'm not gonna burst into the room

548
00:30:31,280 --> 00:30:33,600
until whoever's giving the speech gives the speech.

549
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:34,440
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, for sure.

550
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:37,360
- I'm gonna have a big entrance.

551
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:38,200
- You have a big entrance.

552
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:39,920
- A big awkward entrance that makes everybody hate me.

553
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:40,760
- Okay, cool.

554
00:30:40,760 --> 00:30:43,720
- Wait, so I can manifest any,

555
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:45,980
they're gonna manifest any food that I'm thinking of

556
00:30:45,980 --> 00:30:48,440
at this table is what you're saying?

557
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:49,360
'Cause you cut out.

558
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:52,760
- I didn't quite say that, but I like that idea.

559
00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:54,400
- That's a crazy thing to jump to.

560
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:56,080
- Yeah, that's what you're saying.

561
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:56,920
- Manifest food.

562
00:30:56,920 --> 00:30:58,840
- Was that what you're saying?

563
00:30:58,840 --> 00:30:59,680
- Let's say, yeah, let's--

564
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:03,480
- They're gonna manifest food onto the tables magically?

565
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:05,280
- Let's say you're right.

566
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:06,640
Do it.

567
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:10,840
- Okay, I have a woolly mammoth's leg.

568
00:31:10,840 --> 00:31:11,680
- Nice.

569
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:13,680
- A burnt woolly mammoth's leg, and it's so big.

570
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:14,520
- It's there.

571
00:31:14,520 --> 00:31:17,240
It's funny 'cause what it is,

572
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:20,040
it has to be pulled from the like,

573
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:22,360
not like the farm and like, you know,

574
00:31:22,360 --> 00:31:24,880
organic material sort of warehouse thing.

575
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:28,320
So it's just like, it's like being constructed

576
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:30,280
and created with like transmutation magic.

577
00:31:30,280 --> 00:31:31,800
You're just seeing like a whole chunk of it

578
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:34,540
just leave the warehouse and appear in front of you

579
00:31:34,540 --> 00:31:35,380
as a woolly mammoth's leg.

580
00:31:35,380 --> 00:31:37,580
- The Holy Mammoth shows up,

581
00:31:37,580 --> 00:31:39,580
you can see it through a kind of portal thing,

582
00:31:39,580 --> 00:31:42,060
and you can see a man pulling its leg off.

583
00:31:42,060 --> 00:31:44,460
- Yeah, you're like (growls)

584
00:31:44,460 --> 00:31:47,900
and it's just collapsing over, and it's there for you.

585
00:31:47,900 --> 00:31:50,300
- Hooray!

586
00:31:50,300 --> 00:31:52,100
- And yeah, as you're eating it,

587
00:31:52,100 --> 00:31:58,700
a little snot-nosed boy comes up to you,

588
00:31:58,700 --> 00:32:04,300
and he goes, "Hey Tiny, how 'bout a salad instead?"

589
00:32:04,300 --> 00:32:08,300
Oh, who's this? Roger Clemens.

590
00:32:08,300 --> 00:32:11,900
I flick him.

591
00:32:11,900 --> 00:32:16,400
I flick at him. Ow! Oh, you're a punk.

592
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:20,500
What's wrong with you? You're as stupid as you are big, I bet.

593
00:32:20,500 --> 00:32:24,900
I swing my mammoth leg at him. Because I'm not smart enough to come with a...

594
00:32:24,900 --> 00:32:28,900
Yeah, roll a d20.

595
00:32:28,900 --> 00:32:32,600
Just roll an attack roll. Just go to your character.

596
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:34,600
Or other is it beyond 20?

597
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:37,760
Yeah, just drink through now. Yeah, I

598
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:41,440
Got a 17

599
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:46,800
Yeah, I mean you you hit him in the head roll. There should be a damage option. I

600
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:54,680
Didn't see that. Hold up. I would do do your from your actions. Just do your I supposed to have roll 20 open

601
00:32:54,680 --> 00:33:01,400
No, no, I'd be beyond men. Oh, of course just hit the damage button on next to the quarter staff in your

602
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:04,640
Right, right, quarter staff, where is it?

603
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:05,740
Tell me what you get.

604
00:33:05,740 --> 00:33:11,000
Hold up, is it in my inventory?

605
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:15,540
If you go to your actions and all, it'll be right there.

606
00:33:15,540 --> 00:33:18,480
Are you on your character sheet?

607
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:20,200
Yeah, I'm on my character sheet.

608
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:21,040
Where is it?

609
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:23,040
I never remember how to use this website.

610
00:33:23,040 --> 00:33:23,880
Yeah, me neither.

611
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:24,720
Frankly.

612
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:27,880
Just click, it should be the default actions.

613
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:30,360
Yeah, I have, well I don't have a quarter staff

614
00:33:30,360 --> 00:33:31,200
or anything like that. Well it just came up,

615
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:32,840
You just said that you rolled it.

616
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:33,840
I rolled it.

617
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:34,840
I just saw it on my screen.

618
00:33:34,840 --> 00:33:35,840
I rolled it.

619
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:37,760
Okay, thank you.

620
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:41,640
So I'd refresh your page is what I would do.

621
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:43,440
That's probably the problem.

622
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:45,240
It's in the bottom left corner.

623
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:49,800
Okay no VTT matches were found.

624
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:52,360
Oh, here's my quarter staff.

625
00:33:52,360 --> 00:33:54,320
Alright, wait, roll.

626
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:57,640
23 quarter staff.

627
00:33:57,640 --> 00:34:00,000
So that's the attack roll, which you already got.

628
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:04,000
- Okay, well I got two, if I do, yeah I got five.

629
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,700
- Nice, okay yeah.

630
00:34:05,700 --> 00:34:08,420
So you clobber this guy for five damage.

631
00:34:08,420 --> 00:34:09,260
He's like, "Ow!

632
00:34:09,260 --> 00:34:12,080
"Wait 'til my father hears about this!

633
00:34:12,080 --> 00:34:15,080
"He's on the council at Berry Berry Academy!"

634
00:34:15,080 --> 00:34:17,680
- My father's on the toilet right now.

635
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:19,920
(laughing)

636
00:34:19,920 --> 00:34:23,340
- Ew, is that Elsa from Frozen?

637
00:34:23,340 --> 00:34:24,980
That sucks!

638
00:34:24,980 --> 00:34:27,580
- I swing at him again, but I miss.

639
00:34:27,580 --> 00:34:28,420
- Yeah, all right.

640
00:34:28,420 --> 00:34:30,340
he says Elsa from Frozen sucks.

641
00:34:30,340 --> 00:34:31,300
- Yeah.

642
00:34:31,300 --> 00:34:32,820
- I'm outta here!

643
00:34:32,820 --> 00:34:34,500
And I'll be seeing you punks later.

644
00:34:34,500 --> 00:34:37,720
Don't try to join House Kaiju Manji either.

645
00:34:37,720 --> 00:34:39,540
And he leaves.

646
00:34:39,540 --> 00:34:41,080
- Okay, I won't try that.

647
00:34:41,080 --> 00:34:41,920
- Okay, cool.

648
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:43,580
- So we know which one is Slytherin now.

649
00:34:43,580 --> 00:34:44,860
- Yeah.

650
00:34:44,860 --> 00:34:46,560
Well, they're not quite Slytherin.

651
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:48,460
But anyway.

652
00:34:48,460 --> 00:34:50,180
- So we know which one's Hufflepuff.

653
00:34:50,180 --> 00:34:51,640
- Mm-hmm, sure.

654
00:34:51,640 --> 00:34:58,300
And so then a teacher, an ancient pleasureman,

655
00:34:58,300 --> 00:35:05,300
Um, approaches the stage, lightly floating above, pins and needles inside his head.

656
00:35:05,300 --> 00:35:07,300
Um, and he begins to speak.

657
00:35:07,300 --> 00:35:09,300
It's my birthday!

658
00:35:09,300 --> 00:35:10,300
He begins to speak.

659
00:35:10,300 --> 00:35:12,300
This is how they get you to talk to them.

660
00:35:12,300 --> 00:35:14,300
It's my birthday!

661
00:35:14,300 --> 00:35:17,300
It's his birthday!

662
00:35:17,300 --> 00:35:22,300
Congratulations, and welcome to the school.

663
00:35:22,300 --> 00:35:24,300
Thank you, thank you!

664
00:35:24,300 --> 00:35:26,300
Thank you.

665
00:35:27,300 --> 00:35:29,300
Are you gonna ask if we're together?

666
00:35:29,300 --> 00:35:32,660
I'm going to ask the whole room a question

667
00:35:32,660 --> 00:35:35,460
All right

668
00:35:35,460 --> 00:35:37,940
What is magic really?

669
00:35:37,940 --> 00:35:46,400
It's a series of spells. I take my thumb and my other hand and I start doing this number

670
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:53,420
Something like this or bad

671
00:35:53,460 --> 00:35:58,680
Right about here. Wait a minute. He's lost his thumb. It looks like I got two thumbs

672
00:35:58,680 --> 00:36:01,520
white to

673
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:06,640
And a young young woman's raises her hand and says

674
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:11,200
It's manipulation of spiritual forces that come from the realm between realms

675
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:13,840
Hermione think I'm gonna have sex with that one

676
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:16,200
that is

677
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:17,520
technically correct

678
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:19,520
Miss regatta Reese

679
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:21,560
never mind

680
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:29,320
Put a somewhat different lens on it for all the students today, and then the doors slam open

681
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:33,460
Running oh my god. Oh my god. I'm so sorry. Oh my god. I'm sorry

682

683
00:36:36,940 --> 00:36:41,980
I step on the edge of my gown I could buy tumble I flip over I land on my head the flat

684
00:36:41,980 --> 00:36:46,020
Mortarboard of my cap I stay I'm stuck on it. I'm standing complete

I'm completely upside down just on my head my good my gown falls up

686
00:36:50,540 --> 00:36:54,500
Falls up and down over my body. Are you wearing a naked body? No

00:36:54,500 --> 00:37:00,260
Jostle's my my innards and my bladder punctures and all my pee starts pouring out

688
00:37:00,260 --> 00:37:04,740
Into my mouth and I'm choking on my pee in front of everybody

689
00:37:19,580 --> 00:37:23,980
And also yeah when I turn upside down - everything falls out of my pockets all my keys on my coins

00:37:23,980 --> 00:37:30,760
I've had I have like I have five pounds of coins in my pocket gold coins that all go completely across the entire floor

691
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:40,080
Roll perception Andre, okay

19 okay cool, so you notice in front of you one of the

693
00:37:48,140 --> 00:37:54,180
Teachers who is lining the back was one of the headmasters headmaster of house kaiju manji. This was guest stone

694
00:37:54,180 --> 00:37:56,460
You see him sort of fade into

695
00:37:56,460 --> 00:38:00,920
Like kind of a black abyss and then appear right behind

696
00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:05,380
Dogen and

697
00:38:05,380 --> 00:38:09,980
Woody and he picks both of you guys up by the scruff of your neck

698
00:38:09,980 --> 00:38:13,500
I'm upside down so he holds my butt yeah

699
00:38:13,500 --> 00:38:16,200
- Yeah, you scruffy your butt.

700
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:18,260
And he goes to you, Dogen, he like,

701
00:38:18,260 --> 00:38:19,940
he holds you up higher so your head--

702
00:38:19,940 --> 00:38:22,340
- First he looks over at Woody,

703
00:38:22,340 --> 00:38:23,500
and like looks him right in the face,

704
00:38:23,500 --> 00:38:25,100
then he turns and he's looking right at my--

705
00:38:25,100 --> 00:38:28,180
- Yeah, and he whispers to your butt.

706
00:38:28,180 --> 00:38:30,540
Yeah, he holds, he whispers to your butt,

707
00:38:30,540 --> 00:38:31,980
he starts to whisper to your butt,

708
00:38:31,980 --> 00:38:35,700
and then he stops and like flips you around,

709
00:38:35,700 --> 00:38:39,580
and says, "We let you stay inside of our house.

710
00:38:39,580 --> 00:38:42,120
"Now I need you to behave yourself."

711
00:38:42,120 --> 00:38:47,120
It was an accident, and if you think I did that on purpose, I'll kill myself.

712
00:38:47,120 --> 00:38:52,120
No! He's gonna kill himself! Don't!

713
00:38:52,120 --> 00:38:53,120
You can't hear that, I whispered.

714
00:38:53,120 --> 00:38:55,120
He's got a suicide vest, bomb on!

715
00:38:55,120 --> 00:38:58,120
No I don't! And I lift up my gown again and show it.

716
00:38:58,120 --> 00:39:00,120
Yeah, come on!

717
00:39:00,120 --> 00:39:08,120
He plops the two of you down next to the Goliath, next to Andre, and looks to you, Andre, and says, "Watch them."

718
00:39:08,120 --> 00:39:10,120
Okay.

719
00:39:10,120 --> 00:39:12,120
I snuggle up on his arm.

720
00:39:12,120 --> 00:39:14,120
I'm just looking down at them like this.

721
00:39:14,120 --> 00:39:16,120
(laughter)

722
00:39:16,120 --> 00:39:20,120
And uh,

723
00:39:20,120 --> 00:39:22,120
Mr. Eat Your Pussy Up

724
00:39:22,120 --> 00:39:24,120
continues his speech.

725
00:39:24,120 --> 00:39:26,120
He sort of goes, "Um, okay, well."

726
00:39:26,120 --> 00:39:28,120
"Can you start over?

727
00:39:28,120 --> 00:39:30,120
I missed a lot."

728
00:39:30,120 --> 00:39:33,120
"Well, I began it with 'What is magic, really?'"

729
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:35,120
"Oh, well, technically it's, uh,

730
00:39:35,120 --> 00:39:38,120
what, uh, I don't remember what the girl said before."

731
00:39:38,120 --> 00:39:40,920
- Say a series of spells.

732
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:42,200
- A series of spelling.

733
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:43,960
- Spells.

734
00:39:43,960 --> 00:39:45,480
- Spells.

735
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:46,360
- Magic.

736
00:39:46,360 --> 00:39:51,720
Let's put a different lens on it, is what I was at.

737
00:39:51,720 --> 00:39:53,320
Magic as a means to--

738
00:39:53,320 --> 00:39:55,320
- Oh, it seems like I didn't miss that much after all.

739
00:39:55,320 --> 00:39:56,880
Sorry, sorry everybody, sorry.

740
00:39:56,880 --> 00:40:01,920
- You see the students roll their eyes.

741
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:03,240
See, Regatta Reese is like,

742
00:40:03,240 --> 00:40:05,360
"I can't believe these first years."

743
00:40:05,360 --> 00:40:07,500
You know, she's not having it.

744
00:40:07,500 --> 00:40:12,500
Or is she? Or is she your secret new friend? But then he goes on.

745
00:40:12,500 --> 00:40:19,500
Magic as a means to increase happiness and well-being of others.

746
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:26,500
Magic as a source of pleasure. The ultimate source of pleasure.

747
00:40:26,500 --> 00:40:33,500
One that can't be denied by non-magical threats or the likes of beasts.

748
00:40:33,500 --> 00:40:38,500
or even the designs of our most ardent enemies.

749
00:40:38,500 --> 00:40:44,500
Our pleasure, your pleasure, will not be denied, children.

750
00:40:44,500 --> 00:40:47,500
Pleasure denied to children? What?

751
00:40:47,500 --> 00:40:49,500
That's not a good thing to say, really.

752
00:40:49,500 --> 00:40:51,500
What did you say?

753
00:40:51,500 --> 00:40:55,500
Well, you're all, even if you're adults, you're children to me, because I'm teaching you.

754
00:40:55,500 --> 00:40:57,500
That's not the thing we had a problem with.

755
00:40:57,500 --> 00:41:01,500
Yeah, well, you said it there.

756
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:07,020
said it there. Here you will learn, here you will grow, here you shall grow in magical

757
00:41:07,020 --> 00:41:13,740
prowess and spread our ethos throughout the land. I have magical prowess, that's why I,

758
00:41:13,740 --> 00:41:20,140
that's what I, I learned I had magical prowess and then. Berry Berry Academy was founded on

759
00:41:20,140 --> 00:41:29,340
the principles laid out by the original founder Narcotics Minestrone and we are so fortunate to

760
00:41:29,340 --> 00:41:32,580
to even have his great, great, great, great, great,

761
00:41:32,580 --> 00:41:37,500
great, great granddaughter as the head of the house birdo.

762
00:41:37,500 --> 00:41:42,260
You see this sort of, like, sort of arched eyebrow,

763
00:41:42,260 --> 00:41:46,380
high ponytail, let's say a bitch.

764
00:41:46,380 --> 00:41:47,220
- A basic bitch or just a bitch?

765
00:41:47,220 --> 00:41:50,340
- A bitch, Italian bitch,

766
00:41:50,340 --> 00:41:52,700
with these sort of like elaborate feathered gown.

767
00:41:52,700 --> 00:41:53,860
No, she's not basic.

768
00:41:53,860 --> 00:41:55,460
- Hey, I've already dealt with that at home.

769
00:41:55,460 --> 00:41:56,740
- Or these.

770
00:41:56,740 --> 00:41:58,060
- She's not basic.

771
00:41:58,060 --> 00:41:59,620
- And then you start to take in the other people

772
00:41:59,620 --> 00:42:01,860
next to these folks, right?

773
00:42:01,860 --> 00:42:03,560
- Are there any basic people here?

774
00:42:03,560 --> 00:42:06,720
- I mean, some of the students are pretty basic.

775
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:08,340
- I stand up.

776
00:42:08,340 --> 00:42:10,780
I stand up because I can sense,

777
00:42:10,780 --> 00:42:13,840
or I hear him ask that.

778
00:42:13,840 --> 00:42:15,600
Or were you asking in character?

779
00:42:15,600 --> 00:42:16,440
- No, I wasn't.

780
00:42:16,440 --> 00:42:17,340
- Oh, nevermind then.

781
00:42:17,340 --> 00:42:20,020
I was gonna say, I was gonna stand up and say,

782
00:42:20,020 --> 00:42:22,180
if you're basic, stay the hell away from me.

783
00:42:22,180 --> 00:42:27,120
- And we're lucky to have the esteemed company

784
00:42:27,120 --> 00:42:29,120
of all the heads of the houses,

785
00:42:29,120 --> 00:42:34,760
we have Karen, the head of the Megabats.

786
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:36,720
- Oh, hell no.

787
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:39,560
- You see a woman with,

788
00:42:39,560 --> 00:42:41,260
(laughing)

789
00:42:41,260 --> 00:42:43,160
with like white hair,

790
00:42:43,160 --> 00:42:45,760
like spread out, like in shock,

791
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:47,360
and her eyes wide,

792
00:42:47,360 --> 00:42:48,360
and she just goes like,

793
00:42:48,360 --> 00:42:50,440
(imitating screeching)

794
00:42:50,440 --> 00:42:51,760
She just kinda screeches.

795
00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:54,680
- Classic Karen. - Homo.

796
00:42:54,680 --> 00:42:58,980
the half giant, and the head of the house of giants.

797
00:42:58,980 --> 00:43:03,980
And of course, Gaston, the head of house Kaiju Manji.

798
00:43:03,980 --> 00:43:07,400
You see Hamo, and he's just sort of like a meek giant.

799
00:43:07,400 --> 00:43:08,720
And he sort of sounds like you, actually.

800
00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:12,140
- Is it the same Hamo who shot 50 Cent nine times?

801
00:43:12,140 --> 00:43:13,920
- Maybe.

802
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:15,440
- Oh my God, we'll get to the bottom of this.

803
00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:16,960
- Hi, hi.

804
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:18,520
- He sort of waves at everybody.

805
00:43:18,520 --> 00:43:21,000
- Hello.

806
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:23,040
- And you wave back, you're the only one

807
00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:26,320
waves back immediately.

808
00:43:26,320 --> 00:43:29,560
And you see a Gaston who sort of looks like,

809
00:43:29,560 --> 00:43:33,560
looks kind of like Anton Chigurh,

810
00:43:33,560 --> 00:43:36,280
but with cooler hair.

811
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:38,580
And,

812
00:43:38,580 --> 00:43:43,840
but yeah, oh man, I wrote,

813
00:43:43,840 --> 00:43:45,840
I'll move on.

814
00:43:45,840 --> 00:43:49,580
And he says, "Now, first year students,

815
00:43:49,580 --> 00:43:51,640
"it's time for our sorting ceremony

816
00:43:51,640 --> 00:43:54,480
to determine what house you will be enrolled in.

817
00:43:54,480 --> 00:43:55,320
- I'm so excited.

818
00:43:55,320 --> 00:43:57,440
What house do you guys wanna get?

819
00:43:57,440 --> 00:43:59,400
- I want to get whatever you guys are in.

820
00:43:59,400 --> 00:44:00,800
That's all I care about.

821
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:01,640
- Me too.

822
00:44:01,640 --> 00:44:04,240
- This will most likely be the sole house

823
00:44:04,240 --> 00:44:06,320
for the rest of your time here.

824
00:44:06,320 --> 00:44:09,440
The sorting ritual has rarely been wrong.

825
00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:12,200
Its magic is based in its primordial construction.

826
00:44:12,200 --> 00:44:13,400
- Magic is based?

827
00:44:13,400 --> 00:44:16,140
- Its magic is based and not cringe.

828
00:44:16,140 --> 00:44:19,800
The crystals. - I'll be the judge of that, man.

829
00:44:19,800 --> 00:44:25,600
"Each of you shall rise and place the sorting gauge inside of your earlobe, where it will

830
00:44:25,600 --> 00:44:31,560
then ask you questions and work to extract your greatest truths."

831
00:44:31,560 --> 00:44:36,200
And so you see one first-year student go up there, and he takes the sorting gauge, and

832
00:44:36,200 --> 00:44:41,760
he gets it installed in his earlobe, and he's hollering and screaming in pain and crying.

833
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:45,000
And then you hear him, like, talking to himself and shaking his head.

834
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:48,920
Then you see his eyes go white for, like, a split second.

835
00:44:48,920 --> 00:44:51,160
You see him come back and he's huffing and puffing.

836
00:44:51,160 --> 00:44:52,220
- Hufflepuff.

837
00:44:52,220 --> 00:44:57,220
- And you hear the ear go, "House Giants!"

838
00:44:57,220 --> 00:45:01,800
And you see the student, everyone applauds and he goes off.

839
00:45:01,800 --> 00:45:04,640
- I immediately speed walk over to the kid

840
00:45:04,640 --> 00:45:06,200
and I'm like, "What did you say?

841
00:45:06,200 --> 00:45:07,040
"What did you say?

842
00:45:07,040 --> 00:45:07,880
"What?"

843
00:45:07,880 --> 00:45:10,120
(mumbling)

844
00:45:10,120 --> 00:45:12,280
- And Mr.--

845
00:45:12,280 --> 00:45:13,120
- What did he say?

846
00:45:13,120 --> 00:45:13,940
Just tell me what he said, come on.

847
00:45:13,940 --> 00:45:14,780
- And Mr.--

848
00:45:14,780 --> 00:45:15,620
- I'll pay you, I'll pay you.

849
00:45:15,620 --> 00:45:18,740
- And Mr. Eat Your Pussy Up goes,

850
00:45:18,740 --> 00:45:22,020
Why don't you come next then, Dogen?

851
00:45:22,020 --> 00:45:24,020
Psst, psst, psst, psst.

852
00:45:24,020 --> 00:45:25,660
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

853
00:45:25,660 --> 00:45:26,500
What, what?

854
00:45:26,500 --> 00:45:29,140
Let's all think the same thought

855
00:45:29,140 --> 00:45:33,060
so we get into the same bloody room.

856
00:45:33,060 --> 00:45:34,380
That's a good idea.

857
00:45:34,380 --> 00:45:37,060
How do we get these bunkmates?

858
00:45:37,060 --> 00:45:37,900
So I do have a system--

859
00:45:37,900 --> 00:45:38,740
I guess the bunkmates--

860
00:45:38,740 --> 00:45:40,660
Now we can brush our teeth together.

861
00:45:40,660 --> 00:45:42,620
We can brush our teeth together.

862
00:45:42,620 --> 00:45:43,940
I do have a system here,

863
00:45:43,940 --> 00:45:46,620
so I will see which houses you get into.

864
00:45:46,620 --> 00:45:47,460
Shh.

865
00:45:47,460 --> 00:45:51,740
- You can't put us in different houses.

866
00:45:51,740 --> 00:45:52,780
This, you're joking, right?

867
00:45:52,780 --> 00:45:53,620
- That would be cruel.

868
00:45:53,620 --> 00:45:56,100
- You're doing like a kayfabe here.

869
00:45:56,100 --> 00:45:57,620
- Absolutely cruel and unusual.

870
00:45:57,620 --> 00:45:59,420
- You're doing the same thing that they do in Harry Potter

871
00:45:59,420 --> 00:46:01,980
where he says, the hat says,

872
00:46:01,980 --> 00:46:03,740
Slytherin might be a good choice for you

873
00:46:03,740 --> 00:46:05,540
'cause you're a sick piece of shit.

874
00:46:05,540 --> 00:46:06,900
And then Harry Potter goes,

875
00:46:06,900 --> 00:46:09,180
Gryffindor, Gryffindor, Gryffindor.

876
00:46:09,180 --> 00:46:10,580
- Yeah. - We'll see.

877
00:46:10,580 --> 00:46:11,420
- We'll see, won't we?

878
00:46:11,420 --> 00:46:12,240
- Better not.

879
00:46:12,240 --> 00:46:13,340
- Please not, anything but Slytherin.

880
00:46:13,340 --> 00:46:14,300
Literally anything but Slytherin.

881
00:46:14,300 --> 00:46:16,740
- So you, first thing you have to do

882
00:46:16,740 --> 00:46:19,300
is place the crystal gauge in your earlobe.

883
00:46:19,300 --> 00:46:20,420
- Okay, easy for me.

884
00:46:20,420 --> 00:46:23,100
- Roll a constitution saving throw.

885
00:46:23,100 --> 00:46:23,940
- Okay.

886
00:46:23,940 --> 00:46:29,780
That is a 11.

887
00:46:29,780 --> 00:46:32,100
- Okay, an 11.

888
00:46:32,100 --> 00:46:34,960
- I don't like how long it takes to roll the die.

889
00:46:34,960 --> 00:46:35,800
Yeah.

890
00:46:35,800 --> 00:46:37,280
- All right.

891
00:46:37,280 --> 00:46:40,100
So yeah, you start to feel a little woozy from this.

892
00:46:40,100 --> 00:46:44,860
You withstood it, but not as much as you could have.

893
00:46:46,120 --> 00:46:49,640
Now, as you start to lose blood,

894
00:46:49,640 --> 00:46:51,720
roll a wisdom saving throw.

895
00:46:51,720 --> 00:46:53,040
- Wisdom, okay.

896
00:46:53,040 --> 00:46:56,480
- That is a 14.

897
00:46:56,480 --> 00:46:58,320
- Okay.

898
00:46:58,320 --> 00:47:01,680
Okay.

899
00:47:01,680 --> 00:47:07,460
- They're putting me in giants, I can tell.

900
00:47:07,460 --> 00:47:13,000
- Now, the ear, the lobe starts to ask you some questions.

901
00:47:14,160 --> 00:47:16,040
Simon Says racial hand.

902
00:47:16,040 --> 00:47:18,280
Giant.

903
00:47:18,280 --> 00:47:22,880
- I think it's working.

904
00:47:22,880 --> 00:47:23,720
- Okay.

905
00:47:23,720 --> 00:47:27,120
- He didn't even do the Simon Says, okay.

906
00:47:27,120 --> 00:47:28,400
Next.

907
00:47:28,400 --> 00:47:30,640
- What is your deepest desire?

908
00:47:30,640 --> 00:47:32,620
- To be in the house of giants.

909
00:47:32,620 --> 00:47:36,460
- That could count towards you, it could not.

910
00:47:36,460 --> 00:47:39,640
What is your greatest fear?

911
00:47:39,640 --> 00:47:40,720
- Being small.

912
00:47:40,720 --> 00:47:44,000
- Damn.

913
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:51,000
Okay. Damn, that's real. I live that life.

914
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:55,000
You come across a bumblebee aimlessly buzzing about.

915
00:47:55,000 --> 00:48:00,000
As you better take in the scene, you realize it is attempting to pollinate the flower.

916
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:04,000
However, you notice that the flower is a Neptune bamboozle,

917
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:09,000
a flowered plant that tricks bumblebees into being forcefully swallowed down their stem

918
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:13,000
and encased in a translucent purple tummy lurking below the surface.

919
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:19,000
You also recall that a witch turned your best friend into a bumblebee, so this could be him.

920
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:27,000
However, your best friend also borrowed your lawnmower for a year and keeps meaning to give it back, but it's too heavy sometimes.

921
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:32,000
Also, you've had a thing for his sister, and she is in a pretty vulnerable place right now,

922
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:38,000
looking for comfort from someone who knew her brother well, but in a different way than she knew him.

923
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:42,020
him. This will help her feel like she'll understand her brother in ways she

924
00:48:42,020 --> 00:48:46,480
wouldn't be able to even if he was alive. Almost know him better than she ever

925
00:48:46,480 --> 00:48:50,600
could have. This would carry an immense amount of meaning for her which you

926
00:48:50,600 --> 00:48:55,040
could use to your advantage. Also you're allergic to bees and if they sting you

927
00:48:55,040 --> 00:49:00,240
it will hurt and you will swell up. But there's a one in 100,000 chance that if

928
00:49:00,240 --> 00:49:05,480
a bee stings you you can cure your allergy and gain bee-like superpowers. But

929
00:49:05,480 --> 00:49:10,440
But you won't look gross and weird, and will instead be able to fly and crawl on stuff.

930
00:49:10,440 --> 00:49:11,440
What do you do?

931
00:49:11,440 --> 00:49:12,440
Grow.

932
00:49:12,440 --> 00:49:13,440
What?

933
00:49:13,440 --> 00:49:14,440
Grow.

934
00:49:14,440 --> 00:49:15,440
In size.

935
00:49:15,440 --> 00:49:16,440
Okay.

936
00:49:16,440 --> 00:49:27,440
Your mother just came home with pizza rolls.

937
00:49:27,440 --> 00:49:28,440
Grow.

938
00:49:28,440 --> 00:49:29,440
Yummy.

939
00:49:29,440 --> 00:49:30,440
You say grow?

940
00:49:30,440 --> 00:49:33,440
Okay, well I won't get to that.

941
00:49:33,440 --> 00:49:35,780
- It really seems like he wants to be a giant.

942
00:49:35,780 --> 00:49:38,520
- All right.

943
00:49:38,520 --> 00:49:41,640
Last test.

944
00:49:41,640 --> 00:49:43,880
Your eyes grow white.

945
00:49:43,880 --> 00:49:45,520
- This is in the bag, guys.

946
00:49:45,520 --> 00:49:48,920
- You end up in an ethereal arena.

947
00:49:48,920 --> 00:49:51,340
- What?

948
00:49:51,340 --> 00:49:56,340
- It's you versus something from Dogen's past.

949
00:49:56,340 --> 00:50:00,120
A Needle Lord.

950
00:50:00,120 --> 00:50:01,400
They exist in the Dirtlands.

951
00:50:01,400 --> 00:50:04,400
They spring up from the ground and shoot needles.

952
00:50:04,400 --> 00:50:08,220
They pretend to be cacti and attack humble dirt goblins.

953
00:50:08,220 --> 00:50:10,520
Roll for initiative.

954
00:50:10,520 --> 00:50:13,680
- Okay, damn.

955
00:50:13,680 --> 00:50:15,560
Where's initiative on here?

956
00:50:15,560 --> 00:50:16,400
Oh, I found it.

957
00:50:16,400 --> 00:50:19,360
Okay, that's a 13.

958
00:50:19,360 --> 00:50:20,200
- Okay.

959
00:50:20,200 --> 00:50:22,480
All right, you go first.

960
00:50:22,480 --> 00:50:23,500
What do you wanna do?

961
00:50:23,500 --> 00:50:24,720
- I wanna shake its hand.

962
00:50:24,720 --> 00:50:29,460
And show kindness to it.

963
00:50:29,460 --> 00:50:30,300
- Okay.

964
00:50:30,300 --> 00:50:31,360
- And peace.

965
00:50:31,360 --> 00:50:33,360
and largeness

966
00:50:33,360 --> 00:50:34,640
should be the bigger man

967
00:50:34,640 --> 00:50:37,600
all my god

968
00:50:37,600 --> 00:50:41,440
you uh... that's incredible won't even play at the battle you die

969
00:50:41,440 --> 00:50:44,600
uh...

970
00:50:44,600 --> 00:50:49,820
you come back your eyes are no longer white you felt the cold hand of death

971
00:50:49,820 --> 00:50:51,240
and the gauge goes

972
00:50:51,240 --> 00:50:52,280
house

973
00:50:52,280 --> 00:50:54,560
giant

974
00:50:54,560 --> 00:50:55,320
the

975
00:50:55,320 --> 00:50:56,840
racialized

976
00:50:56,840 --> 00:50:59,400
he got what he wanted

977
00:50:59,400 --> 00:51:01,840
We did, okay now you guys, here's the cookie.

978
00:51:01,840 --> 00:51:03,880
Just say a bunch of stuff about being big.

979
00:51:03,880 --> 00:51:05,640
(laughing)

980
00:51:05,640 --> 00:51:06,920
Being big?

981
00:51:06,920 --> 00:51:08,680
I don't know if I can do that.

982
00:51:08,680 --> 00:51:09,720
(laughing)

983
00:51:09,720 --> 00:51:12,480
All right, so who wants to go next of you two?

984
00:51:12,480 --> 00:51:13,680
Let me go.

985
00:51:13,680 --> 00:51:15,040
Let me at it.

986
00:51:15,040 --> 00:51:17,800
You saunter up there, roll a constitution saving throw.

987
00:51:17,800 --> 00:51:18,780
Okay, bitch.

988
00:51:18,780 --> 00:51:21,760
All right, I'm gonna call me a bitch.

989
00:51:21,760 --> 00:51:22,600
That's fine.

990
00:51:22,600 --> 00:51:25,600
Nat 20.

991
00:51:25,600 --> 00:51:26,440
Whoa.

992
00:51:26,440 --> 00:51:27,760
Wow, okay.

993
00:51:27,760 --> 00:51:30,840
Next, roll wisdom saving throw.

994
00:51:30,840 --> 00:51:35,840
As I walk up I go boom, boom, boom, boom, thump,

995
00:51:35,840 --> 00:51:39,320
with every single tiny step that I make.

996
00:51:39,320 --> 00:51:40,520
You got the hooves though.

997
00:51:40,520 --> 00:51:42,240
True.

998
00:51:42,240 --> 00:51:43,760
You do have some booming footsteps.

999
00:51:43,760 --> 00:51:45,000
You got the hooves though.

1000
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:49,040
Yeah, you got the hooves though.

1001
00:51:49,040 --> 00:51:50,400
Now what?

1002
00:51:50,400 --> 00:51:51,600
Roll wisdom saving throw.

1003
00:51:54,960 --> 00:51:56,240
That is a 15.

1004
00:51:56,240 --> 00:52:02,360
- Okay.

1005
00:52:02,360 --> 00:52:08,520
What is your deepest desire?

1006
00:52:08,520 --> 00:52:13,660
- Ooh, um,

1007
00:52:13,660 --> 00:52:17,320
large, large-ness.

1008
00:52:17,320 --> 00:52:18,400
To be large.

1009
00:52:18,400 --> 00:52:22,320
- Your greatest fear?

1010
00:52:24,600 --> 00:52:26,440
being away

1011
00:52:26,440 --> 00:52:29,200
who got up

1012
00:52:29,200 --> 00:52:31,320
but

1013
00:52:31,320 --> 00:52:36,120
you hear the bubble the story again what do you do

1014
00:52:36,120 --> 00:52:37,480
i'm gonna hear it again

1015
00:52:37,480 --> 00:52:40,960
you give it to you one more dollar please

1016
00:52:40,960 --> 00:52:46,640
now i'm getting i'd hate them probably

1017
00:52:46,640 --> 00:52:48,920
well

1018
00:52:48,920 --> 00:52:51,340
next story

1019
00:52:51,340 --> 00:52:53,840
Your mother just came home with pizza rolls.

1020
00:52:53,840 --> 00:52:54,800
- I love you, mom.

1021
00:52:54,800 --> 00:52:55,800
Thank you so much.

1022
00:52:55,800 --> 00:52:57,400
- Yummy.

1023
00:52:57,400 --> 00:52:59,960
However, she says that you must wait to heat them up

1024
00:52:59,960 --> 00:53:02,840
until your little brother gets back from soccer practice.

1025
00:53:02,840 --> 00:53:04,040
- He's alive?

1026
00:53:04,040 --> 00:53:05,640
- You are so hungry right now.

1027
00:53:05,640 --> 00:53:07,200
So hungry.

1028
00:53:07,200 --> 00:53:08,040
Mm.

1029
00:53:08,040 --> 00:53:11,180
Maybe what mom doesn't know won't kill her.

1030
00:53:11,180 --> 00:53:12,280
Let me have some.

1031
00:53:12,280 --> 00:53:13,340
Hmm.

1032
00:53:13,340 --> 00:53:15,280
Why don't I use the oven instead of the microwave?

1033
00:53:15,280 --> 00:53:17,960
That way they'll get crispy and heat up more evenly.

1034
00:53:17,960 --> 00:53:20,200
Okay, let me open the oven and just put these on a tray.

1035
00:53:20,200 --> 00:53:22,560
Oh, nothing mom, nothing.

1036
00:53:22,560 --> 00:53:24,040
Just finishing up homework.

1037
00:53:24,040 --> 00:53:25,980
Yeah.

1038
00:53:25,980 --> 00:53:26,820
No, that's why.

1039
00:53:26,820 --> 00:53:29,960
No, I would never heat up pizza rolls in the oven.

1040
00:53:29,960 --> 00:53:31,600
I'm waiting for my baby brother.

1041
00:53:31,600 --> 00:53:34,760
The fool, now back to my pizza rolls.

1042
00:53:34,760 --> 00:53:36,720
What's your favorite pizza roll flavor?

1043
00:53:36,720 --> 00:53:40,120
Margherita.

1044
00:53:40,120 --> 00:53:43,840
Okay.

1045
00:53:43,840 --> 00:53:48,040
Your eyes turn white.

1046
00:53:48,040 --> 00:53:49,620
You enter the combat zone.

1047
00:53:49,620 --> 00:53:54,620
You come across a gibbering mouther.

1048
00:53:54,620 --> 00:54:02,760
- And which is what?

1049
00:54:02,760 --> 00:54:04,480
- A horrible-- - I know about this thing.

1050
00:54:04,480 --> 00:54:06,420
- Yeah, it's a horrible-- - It's a blob.

1051
00:54:06,420 --> 00:54:08,780
- It's a blob with a million mouths.

1052
00:54:08,780 --> 00:54:12,240
And it's coming for you.

1053
00:54:12,240 --> 00:54:13,580
You can't tell what you want from it

1054
00:54:13,580 --> 00:54:14,840
or what it wants from you.

1055
00:54:17,560 --> 00:54:23,960
I would like to go around and kiss every last mouth on this blabberer.

1056
00:54:23,960 --> 00:54:27,280
Big deep ones too.

1057
00:54:27,280 --> 00:54:28,600
Passionate type deal.

1058
00:54:28,600 --> 00:54:29,600
You die.

1059
00:54:29,600 --> 00:54:34,080
It's not real man.

1060
00:54:34,080 --> 00:54:36,000
None of this is real.

1061
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:38,440
House giant!

1062
00:54:38,440 --> 00:54:40,240
Let's fucking go!

1063
00:54:40,240 --> 00:54:41,240
Yo!

1064
00:54:41,240 --> 00:54:43,280
It was close.

1065
00:54:43,280 --> 00:54:46,920
I don't know why I think this but I feel like this last guy Andre

1066
00:54:46,920 --> 00:54:51,000
I feel like he's got it on lock for house of it is no doubt. He's gonna be a giant

1067
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:55,760
Joining us brush our teeth together every night

1068
00:54:55,760 --> 00:55:02,760
To brush our teeth I like my teeth a lot you can tell that I never brush my teeth

1069
00:55:02,760 --> 00:55:07,560
All right, I don't know

1070
00:55:09,520 --> 00:55:15,060
Yeah, we need natural oh yeah, joy, you're already giant constitution saving throw

1071
00:55:15,060 --> 00:55:29,120
Wisdom saving throw 17

1072
00:55:39,080 --> 00:55:41,680
Okay, what if I get house of the small?

1073
00:55:41,680 --> 00:55:47,080
What is your dearest not you don't have to worry about that? That's not a house. It's okay. Well, I deepest desire

1074
00:55:47,080 --> 00:55:52,000
Pizza rolls

1075
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:58,040
Could he hear what I was hearing pizza pizza rolls for dinner

1076
00:55:58,040 --> 00:56:02,560
And what a bumblebee. What is your greatest fear?

1077
00:56:06,600 --> 00:56:09,140
Because it's too small. I'm yelling from the

1078
00:56:09,140 --> 00:56:14,100
It's too small. He's scared of it. Yeah, right

1079
00:56:14,100 --> 00:56:18,060
Simon says raise your hands

1080
00:56:18,060 --> 00:56:21,020
Simon says put your hands down

1081
00:56:21,020 --> 00:56:23,660
Put your hands up. Oh

1082
00:56:23,660 --> 00:56:29,060
It's taking him a long time to raise his hands up and down because I'm bigger than ours

1083
00:56:30,180 --> 00:56:36,800
I'll have large muscles and joints cuz I'm a look just put me in the house of the giant

1084
00:56:36,800 --> 00:56:39,260
house of the giant

1085
00:56:39,260 --> 00:56:43,900
All right, yes

1086
00:56:43,900 --> 00:56:51,280
This was too this was too much. There's no way there's no way that I'm allowed in any other house

1087
00:56:51,280 --> 00:56:56,760
We can't have a fucking Hogwarts campaign. We're all in doing we'd not room. That would have been yeah

1088
00:56:56,760 --> 00:56:58,760
That would have been fucking cruel that would have been the worst

1089
00:56:58,760 --> 00:56:59,600
- That's the worst thing I could even imagine.

1090
00:56:59,600 --> 00:57:01,360
- It would be pretty funny though.

1091
00:57:01,360 --> 00:57:04,160
You guys would have had to try to hang out in another way.

1092
00:57:04,160 --> 00:57:06,440
So you see Hamo and he comes up to all three of you

1093
00:57:06,440 --> 00:57:09,160
and gives you all a big hug, he's very excited.

1094
00:57:09,160 --> 00:57:11,520
He's one of the last half giants alive.

1095
00:57:11,520 --> 00:57:14,160
- How tall is he? - Boom, boom.

1096
00:57:14,160 --> 00:57:17,280
- I mean, he's like properly 12 feet,

1097
00:57:17,280 --> 00:57:20,280
where a Goliath is maybe like eight feet, nine feet.

1098
00:57:20,280 --> 00:57:22,480
He's like 12 feet and like girthy.

1099
00:57:22,480 --> 00:57:25,900
- So Andre is tall even for a Goliath.

1100
00:57:27,640 --> 00:57:29,040
- Why, what's a Goliath size?

1101
00:57:29,040 --> 00:57:30,560
- Well, he--

1102
00:57:30,560 --> 00:57:31,800
- Goliath-- - He said that he's--

1103
00:57:31,800 --> 00:57:33,360
You just said that they're eight feet,

1104
00:57:33,360 --> 00:57:35,000
and he said he's 15 feet.

1105
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:36,120
- No, no.

1106
00:57:36,120 --> 00:57:37,920
He is not 15 feet, that is crazy.

1107
00:57:37,920 --> 00:57:40,960
- I'm 15 feet, that's in my character description.

1108
00:57:40,960 --> 00:57:43,720
- Is that how big a Goliath can be?

1109
00:57:43,720 --> 00:57:46,520
- That's how big I am, I'm weird.

1110
00:57:46,520 --> 00:57:47,360
- Okay, fine.

1111
00:57:47,360 --> 00:57:50,480
- Oh yeah. - You're big for a Goliath.

1112
00:57:50,480 --> 00:57:52,240
- Twice the size of every other Goliath.

1113
00:57:52,240 --> 00:57:55,040
- God damn it, so big, okay.

1114
00:57:55,040 --> 00:57:57,200
- He's like, "I'm so excited to have you all

1115
00:57:57,200 --> 00:57:59,100
in the house of giant.

1116
00:57:59,100 --> 00:58:00,020
- What did you say?

1117
00:58:00,020 --> 00:58:01,660
I couldn't hear you up here.

1118
00:58:01,660 --> 00:58:03,920
(laughing)

1119
00:58:03,920 --> 00:58:05,920
- It's Goliath humor.

1120
00:58:05,920 --> 00:58:07,180
It's Goliath humor, Dogen.

1121
00:58:07,180 --> 00:58:09,100
We're gonna have to get used to this type of thing.

1122
00:58:09,100 --> 00:58:12,220
- I really regret this already.

1123
00:58:12,220 --> 00:58:13,740
- Hey, how's the weather up there?

1124
00:58:13,740 --> 00:58:14,620
No, I'm kidding.

1125
00:58:14,620 --> 00:58:16,180
I can see the weather too.

1126
00:58:16,180 --> 00:58:17,200
I'm a giant.

1127
00:58:17,200 --> 00:58:19,860
- Wait, how big are you?

1128
00:58:19,860 --> 00:58:20,980
Are you the same size as me?

1129
00:58:20,980 --> 00:58:22,660
- I'm about, how big is a satyr?

1130
00:58:22,660 --> 00:58:24,220
I'm a little taller than a normal person

1131
00:58:24,220 --> 00:58:26,080
'cause of my horse legs, right?

1132
00:58:26,080 --> 00:58:29,240
i thought i said it was really small okay now they're not like phil i thought i

1133
00:58:29,240 --> 00:58:34,900
imagine a normal for james phil no phil is unusual

1134
00:58:34,900 --> 00:58:39,280
okay so i'm like five so i'm just i mean i thought that it was going to be there

1135
00:58:39,280 --> 00:58:40,960
was a big guy into tiny

1136
00:58:40,960 --> 00:58:43,000
all your tiny to okay five-by

1137
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:44,620
to study to him

1138
00:58:44,620 --> 00:58:46,280
so the giant takes

1139
00:58:46,280 --> 00:58:48,040
the giant house i mean

1140
00:58:48,040 --> 00:58:49,520
j

1141
00:58:49,520 --> 00:58:51,320
not who's my separate

1142
00:58:51,320 --> 00:58:52,880
specifics

1143
00:58:52,880 --> 00:58:55,840
- They specialize in the five schools of magic,

1144
00:58:55,840 --> 00:58:57,500
which we'll get into eventually.

1145
00:58:57,500 --> 00:58:59,120
They're scary magic, funny magic,

1146
00:58:59,120 --> 00:59:02,340
creepy magic, healthy magic, attacking class.

1147
00:59:02,340 --> 00:59:04,920
So they specialize in attacking and healthy.

1148
00:59:04,920 --> 00:59:10,460
So that means lots of abjuration types of spells,

1149
00:59:10,460 --> 00:59:14,300
restoration spells, some light necromancy,

1150
00:59:14,300 --> 00:59:16,820
but not fully necromancy spells.

1151
00:59:16,820 --> 00:59:18,020
And then attacking spells.

1152
00:59:18,020 --> 00:59:22,540
So theirs are usually more based in physical objects

1153
00:59:22,540 --> 00:59:25,260
and physical attacking, but they'll do like a fireball

1154
00:59:25,260 --> 00:59:28,300
as well as like an icicle, just kind of ice spells

1155
00:59:28,300 --> 00:59:29,140
and shit like that.

1156
00:59:29,140 --> 00:59:30,940
- Both ends of the heat spectrum.

1157
00:59:30,940 --> 00:59:33,060
- Yes, fire giants, ice giants.

1158
00:59:33,060 --> 00:59:38,060
So it's a good balanced house to be in.

1159
00:59:38,060 --> 00:59:45,880
But yeah, so now you've been sorted into your houses.

1160
00:59:45,880 --> 00:59:52,300
Let's take you over, let's cut to our story

1161
00:59:52,300 --> 01:00:03,460
from before. 24 hours earlier from where we last left Marlon Reese. So from before he

1162
01:00:03,460 --> 01:00:09,660
was diving down into that cavern. He was working in the mine as usual, head down, chin down,

1163
01:00:09,660 --> 01:00:13,500
arms down. They go back up, then it comes down again, striking the surrounding rock

1164
01:00:13,500 --> 01:00:18,660
with a pickaxe, making headway, finding more magic crystals. A telepathic voice echoes

1165
01:00:18,660 --> 01:00:21,660
in all the miners' ears, a direct order from the Overseer.

1166
01:00:21,660 --> 01:00:29,660
"Marlin Reist, please report to the Overseer. Marlin Reist, please report to the Overseer."

1167
01:00:29,660 --> 01:00:34,940
Marlin exhaled, and made his way back toward the entrance to the shaft, past the other

1168
01:00:34,940 --> 01:00:40,220
crystal workers who glanced with some grim satisfaction that some other j'moke was being

1169
01:00:40,220 --> 01:00:44,400
called. Marlin reached a small outcropping toward the mouth of the cavern, where the

1170
01:00:44,400 --> 01:00:49,780
The overseer pours over tedious work orders from the Buryberry Academy, scolds mining

1171
01:00:49,780 --> 01:00:53,920
captains and eats copious amounts of yummy gummy snacks.

1172
01:00:53,920 --> 01:00:59,300
The overseer of mine 24A is Gale, a stout, snobbish wood elf with a penchant for all previously

1173
01:00:59,300 --> 01:01:05,160
mentioned activities, as well as for $20 words, many of which are made from scratch.

1174
01:01:05,160 --> 01:01:10,320
Marlin waited a tick just outside the crude wooden door before Gale hollered, "You may

1175
01:01:10,320 --> 01:01:11,320
enter!"

1176
01:01:11,320 --> 01:01:15,840
through the door, careful not to let his idle tail get caught on it as it swings

1177
01:01:15,840 --> 01:01:23,040
back fast on overtaut hinges. "A query, Reese," began Gale, twirling his pointer

1178
01:01:23,040 --> 01:01:29,500
finger around a tea-stained document. "And perhaps a welcome reminder for me. You do

1179
01:01:29,500 --> 01:01:35,240
not labor delectatiously, no?" Marlin's tail slowed its gentle instinctual sway.

1180
01:01:35,240 --> 01:01:39,640
"What could that mean?" he wondered. "Yes, I don't," he complied.

1181
01:01:39,640 --> 01:01:41,640
Gail frowned then smiled

1182
01:01:41,640 --> 01:01:47,100
So if there were say a means by which you could supplement your habitualities

1183
01:01:47,100 --> 01:01:50,200
necessarily or otherwise

1184
01:01:50,200 --> 01:01:52,360
Would you?

1185
01:01:52,360 --> 01:01:54,360
And Marlon said yes

1186
01:01:54,360 --> 01:01:56,440
Gail's expression remained unchanged

1187
01:01:56,440 --> 01:02:02,800
He rose from his desk pushing his seat out with his gut and began to make a very practiced circle around his desk

1188
01:02:03,920 --> 01:02:09,560
"Qualities to which you've admitted are not always ideal in an employee, Marlin, but you

1189
01:02:09,560 --> 01:02:12,480
are in fortu-cessity."

1190
01:02:12,480 --> 01:02:17,240
Gale faced the corner of his outcropping office and stood at attention, placed his two fingers

1191
01:02:17,240 --> 01:02:19,360
in a V-shape before his mouth.

1192
01:02:19,360 --> 01:02:21,540
The pleasuremen saluted.

1193
01:02:21,540 --> 01:02:25,620
From the ether suddenly appeared a pleasuremen of fantastic standing, one which we've met

1194
01:02:25,620 --> 01:02:30,560
before in our adventures, that evil Stievel knew, though he now finds himself a lord,

1195
01:02:30,560 --> 01:02:32,560
Lord Poonhead.

1196
01:02:32,560 --> 01:02:38,240
Marlin tucked his tail in at the sight of royalty and performed the salute.

1197
01:02:38,240 --> 01:02:41,880
Marlin hadn't even seen Poonhead before, but it's hard to mistake the lord who hails from

1198
01:02:41,880 --> 01:02:46,640
the trebuchet region for anyone else with that vagina on his forehead.

1199
01:02:46,640 --> 01:02:48,740
Lord Poonhead gestured for the men to be at ease.

1200
01:02:48,740 --> 01:02:50,680
He met Marlin's gaze.

1201
01:02:50,680 --> 01:02:53,240
This is something worth remarking.

1202
01:02:53,240 --> 01:02:58,740
Beriberi is under the Terrifyer Kingdom, which means the much weakened King Nardwar, along

1203
01:02:58,740 --> 01:03:04,140
with his crusading son, Prince Jumanji, who is a child now possessed by a black heart of

1204
01:03:04,140 --> 01:03:08,860
death due to the influence of three Aerswile adventurers.

1205
01:03:08,860 --> 01:03:12,180
But Beriberi is also not quite under the Terrifyer Kingdom.

1206
01:03:12,180 --> 01:03:16,380
They sort of have like a weird relationship where they collect tithes.

1207
01:03:16,380 --> 01:03:21,220
I can do this another time, but it's just no secret that an open-minded, magically inclined,

1208
01:03:21,220 --> 01:03:26,340
and somewhat occult Beriberi region is more aligned to pleasuremen than, say, a nard or

1209
01:03:26,340 --> 01:03:28,420
or a troll lord or something.

1210
01:03:28,420 --> 01:03:31,460
Nevermind that the Pleasure Men take,

1211
01:03:31,460 --> 01:03:34,020
some of the Pleasure Men take a cut of the Minds Prophets

1212
01:03:34,020 --> 01:03:35,260
and the Schools Prophets.

1213
01:03:35,260 --> 01:03:40,420
- Marlin Reese, I have something very important

1214
01:03:40,420 --> 01:03:41,420
to ask of you.

1215
01:03:41,420 --> 01:03:45,140
If you do this, you shall be compensated

1216
01:03:45,140 --> 01:03:48,440
so that you, your daughter, and anyone who wouldn't,

1217
01:03:48,440 --> 01:03:49,900
anyone you love wouldn't have to work

1218
01:03:49,900 --> 01:03:51,780
for this lifetime or the next.

1219
01:03:51,780 --> 01:03:54,760
It will maximize your pleasure.

1220
01:03:56,020 --> 01:03:58,020
Will you hear me out?

1221
01:03:58,020 --> 01:04:02,220
Marlin knew this wasn't a choice, but he would have said yes anyway.

1222
01:04:02,220 --> 01:04:04,220
Of course, my lord.

1223
01:04:04,220 --> 01:04:05,220
Most pleasurable.

1224
01:04:05,220 --> 01:04:07,820
Gael, you're dismissed.

1225
01:04:07,820 --> 01:04:10,140
Gael nearly protested, but remembered himself.

1226
01:04:10,140 --> 01:04:14,780
He saluted Poon Head and left the outcropping in a controlled huff.

1227
01:04:14,780 --> 01:04:19,300
Marlin Wreath, you have been mining these tunnels for thirty long years.

1228
01:04:19,300 --> 01:04:23,360
You've never moved tunnels, you've never opted to manage those below you.

1229
01:04:23,360 --> 01:04:26,360
You know the underground inside and out.

1230
01:04:26,360 --> 01:04:31,080
You know what we use these crystals for, yes?

1231
01:04:31,080 --> 01:04:34,860
They contain magical properties that help fuel all of the terror fire kingdom, my lord.

1232
01:04:34,860 --> 01:04:38,320
They can produce magical light, flavor, kinetic energy, and more.

1233
01:04:38,320 --> 01:04:41,460
They help our villages run and our homes stay safe from monsters.

1234
01:04:41,460 --> 01:04:45,840
They can enhance our senses and make us stronger, quicker, even granting non-magic users a chance

1235
01:04:45,840 --> 01:04:46,840
of performing miracles.

1236
01:04:46,840 --> 01:04:51,000
They are difficult to manipulate and quickly burn out, and so we mine them for as long as

1237
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:57,600
were able my lord. This is a pleasurable answer but only partially correct. We

1238
01:04:57,600 --> 01:05:01,760
also study them Marlon and in knowing them we hope not to only fuel the

1239
01:05:01,760 --> 01:05:06,900
kingdom but collectively evolve into something greater than ourselves. Marlon

1240
01:05:06,900 --> 01:05:10,960
Reese I need you to travel to the deepest depths of this mind and return to me a

1241
01:05:10,960 --> 01:05:17,840
soft crystal. Of course my lord but if I may what is a soft crystal? In all my

1242
01:05:17,840 --> 01:05:22,400
years they've only been brittle and hard and in response to extreme heat, pressure,

1243
01:05:22,400 --> 01:05:28,000
and magical energy, they turn to dust. A prudent and pleasurable question, Marlon.

1244
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:34,560
A soft crystal is what it sounds like. A crystal soft like pillows and flesh and intestines and

1245
01:05:34,560 --> 01:05:41,440
clouds. It exists, we know that now from our experimentations. We believe that further down

1246
01:05:41,440 --> 01:05:46,720
the conditions are right for this very thing. I promise you if you retrieve one, placing it in

1247
01:05:46,720 --> 01:05:49,400
in this container, he hands him the container,

1248
01:05:49,400 --> 01:05:50,920
you'll be compensated by the kingdom

1249
01:05:50,920 --> 01:05:53,860
for all yours and your daughter's life.

1250
01:05:53,860 --> 01:05:54,880
I swear I'll do it.

1251
01:05:54,880 --> 01:05:58,220
And so, we head back.

1252
01:05:58,220 --> 01:06:02,680
You three are now in the giant's dorm room.

1253
01:06:02,680 --> 01:06:04,120
It is very big.

1254
01:06:04,120 --> 01:06:06,820
The beds are too big.

1255
01:06:06,820 --> 01:06:08,840
You guys could all sleep in a bed together.

1256
01:06:08,840 --> 01:06:10,880
Except for you, yes.

1257
01:06:10,880 --> 01:06:12,520
- Too small for me, I'm the 15 foot.

1258
01:06:12,520 --> 01:06:15,760
- I guess it looks like we're bunking together, Woody.

1259
01:06:15,760 --> 01:06:16,760
All right.

1260
01:06:16,760 --> 01:06:19,920
You see clouds sort of passing over.

1261
01:06:19,920 --> 01:06:22,060
You see mountains, sort of mountain

1262
01:06:22,060 --> 01:06:24,100
statues and mountain

1263
01:06:24,100 --> 01:06:27,640
like sort of wallpaper that's like

1264
01:06:27,640 --> 01:06:28,960
moving and looks like it's almost

1265
01:06:28,960 --> 01:06:30,960
like a video of a mountain, like

1266
01:06:30,960 --> 01:06:33,200
creating this environment of

1267
01:06:33,200 --> 01:06:35,240
that's going to be something cool.

1268
01:06:35,240 --> 01:06:37,160
OK.

1269
01:06:37,160 --> 01:06:38,400
Everything's cool here.

1270
01:06:38,400 --> 01:06:39,440
Yeah.

1271
01:06:39,440 --> 01:06:41,800
Can I summon Dylan?

1272
01:06:41,800 --> 01:06:44,200
Yeah, you can talk to Dylan.

1273
01:06:45,040 --> 01:06:48,080
Can I summon him in a portal on the wall?

1274
01:06:48,080 --> 01:06:50,000
So that they can meet Dylan?

1275
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:51,120
Yeah, shit, why not?

1276
01:06:51,120 --> 01:06:55,520
All right, I take out my, I have a wand, right?

1277
01:06:55,520 --> 01:06:56,680
Yeah, you do.

1278
01:06:56,680 --> 01:06:58,500
Okay, I take out my wand.

1279
01:06:58,500 --> 01:07:00,980
I point my wand at the wall and I say,

1280
01:07:00,980 --> 01:07:07,520
Dylan Mulvaney.

1281
01:07:07,520 --> 01:07:10,240
That's his name?

1282
01:07:13,600 --> 01:07:17,080
- And you see in the image in the background,

1283
01:07:17,080 --> 01:07:18,500
like you see like-- - It's not related

1284
01:07:18,500 --> 01:07:23,040
to anyone in the real world, it's just a spell.

1285
01:07:23,040 --> 01:07:26,860
- Right, you see a man with a blue shirt

1286
01:07:26,860 --> 01:07:30,080
and a gold star sitting on a couch.

1287
01:07:30,080 --> 01:07:32,620
- A portal type deal?

1288
01:07:32,620 --> 01:07:34,460
- Yeah, cross-legged. - Geronimo!

1289
01:07:34,460 --> 01:07:35,600
I jump in.

1290
01:07:35,600 --> 01:07:38,120
- Yeah, I mean, you can't actually jump,

1291
01:07:38,120 --> 01:07:40,660
it just looks like a portal, you can't visit there.

1292
01:07:42,200 --> 01:07:44,240
- He's sitting cross-legged on the couch

1293
01:07:44,240 --> 01:07:45,580
with his sneakers on.

1294
01:07:45,580 --> 01:07:52,060
And, but when he sees you summon him,

1295
01:07:52,060 --> 01:07:52,900
he goes, "Oh!"

1296
01:07:52,900 --> 01:07:54,600
And he starts to take his sneakers off,

1297
01:07:54,600 --> 01:07:56,660
feeling embarrassed.

1298
01:07:56,660 --> 01:07:58,420
- Take 'em off.

1299
01:07:58,420 --> 01:08:02,100
- And he says, "Hey, hey, what's going on?

1300
01:08:02,100 --> 01:08:02,940
"How you doing, Andre?" - Hello, this is Andre.

1301
01:08:02,940 --> 01:08:04,220
- From the House of Giants.

1302
01:08:04,220 --> 01:08:05,360
Nice to meet you, by the way.

1303
01:08:05,360 --> 01:08:06,440
- Dylan, this is

1304
01:08:06,440 --> 01:08:09,400
- I'm Woody. - Dogen.

1305
01:08:09,400 --> 01:08:11,060
- And Woody.

1306
01:08:11,060 --> 01:08:12,300
I'm Rod Dogen you.

1307
01:08:12,300 --> 01:08:15,160
Awesome, very awesome.

1308
01:08:15,160 --> 01:08:19,220
We are at school.

1309
01:08:19,220 --> 01:08:21,180
Oh, you're in school still, that's awesome.

1310
01:08:21,180 --> 01:08:22,460
So what, did you learn anything yet?

1311
01:08:22,460 --> 01:08:23,920
Not still, we just started.

1312
01:08:23,920 --> 01:08:26,420
We found our bedroom.

1313
01:08:26,420 --> 01:08:28,740
And it's big.

1314
01:08:28,740 --> 01:08:30,220
That's awesome.

1315
01:08:30,220 --> 01:08:31,720
That's so cool.

1316
01:08:31,720 --> 01:08:33,300
My bedroom's not that big.

1317
01:08:33,300 --> 01:08:34,760
But it's cool that yours is.

1318
01:08:34,760 --> 01:08:38,780
Do you guys, what are you guys gonna do?

1319
01:08:38,780 --> 01:08:40,380
What are you guys up to today?

1320
01:08:40,380 --> 01:08:42,180
We're gonna go to a party!

1321
01:08:42,180 --> 01:08:43,180
You wanna come?

1322
01:08:43,180 --> 01:08:46,740
I wish I could, but I'm still here.

1323
01:08:46,740 --> 01:08:48,740
We're gonna drink mead!

1324
01:08:48,740 --> 01:08:49,740
Oh.

1325
01:08:49,740 --> 01:08:50,740
Yay!

1326
01:08:50,740 --> 01:08:52,020
Love me some mead.

1327
01:08:52,020 --> 01:08:54,740
Gallons of the stuff.

1328
01:08:54,740 --> 01:08:55,740
Love it.

1329
01:08:55,740 --> 01:08:56,740
Cow wagons.

1330
01:08:56,740 --> 01:08:57,740
Could you say dillons of the stuff?

1331
01:08:57,740 --> 01:09:00,900
Dillons of the stuff, well, now I say dillons.

1332
01:09:00,900 --> 01:09:01,900
I used to say gallons!

1333
01:09:01,900 --> 01:09:05,500
I'll have two pints and then I'm done.

1334
01:09:05,500 --> 01:09:08,900
Alright, bit of a light weight dillon.

1335
01:09:08,900 --> 01:09:11,140
(laughing)

1336
01:09:11,140 --> 01:09:12,260
- What?

1337
01:09:12,260 --> 01:09:13,460
- I can't hear you quite.

1338
01:09:13,460 --> 01:09:15,360
- Dylan, it's breaking up a little bit.

1339
01:09:15,360 --> 01:09:20,220
- I like the star on your tunic.

1340
01:09:20,220 --> 01:09:22,460
- Oh, I made it myself, thank you.

1341
01:09:22,460 --> 01:09:23,620
- Wow.

1342
01:09:23,620 --> 01:09:26,300
- I think this guy's a bit of a fruit loop.

1343
01:09:26,300 --> 01:09:30,660
- His star can, I can contact him through his star.

1344
01:09:30,660 --> 01:09:32,380
- You see him reach out of the portal's frame

1345
01:09:32,380 --> 01:09:35,620
and get a box of fruit loops and pull her bowl.

1346
01:09:35,620 --> 01:09:37,140
- I'm not sure what that is.

1347
01:09:37,140 --> 01:09:39,780
(laughing)

1348
01:09:39,780 --> 01:09:41,700
- Cereal for dinner.

1349
01:09:41,700 --> 01:09:43,700
All right, Dylan, seems like you might have

1350
01:09:43,700 --> 01:09:45,100
the coolest life ever.

1351
01:09:45,100 --> 01:09:48,260
- Well, to us, we're in the past,

1352
01:09:48,260 --> 01:09:50,460
so cereal is like a cereal grain,

1353
01:09:50,460 --> 01:09:51,300
like a horse would eat.

1354
01:09:51,300 --> 01:09:53,820
Like we're a drop of oats.

1355
01:09:53,820 --> 01:09:56,820
- Cool. - Cool, man.

1356
01:09:56,820 --> 01:09:58,020
- Wow.

1357
01:09:58,020 --> 01:10:00,260
- That's my pet horse.

1358
01:10:00,260 --> 01:10:01,900
I talk to him in a poodle.

1359
01:10:01,900 --> 01:10:02,740
(laughing)

1360
01:10:02,740 --> 01:10:05,180
- You think he's, he's always eating cereal,

1361
01:10:05,180 --> 01:10:06,500
so you think he's a horse.

1362
01:10:06,500 --> 01:10:09,500
I'm not sure what kind of creature this is, but it's disgusting.

1363
01:10:09,500 --> 01:10:13,660
It's one of my weirdest pets.

1364
01:10:13,660 --> 01:10:16,260
I keep a lot of pets too.

1365
01:10:16,260 --> 01:10:17,820
Really?

1366
01:10:17,820 --> 01:10:20,420
All right, I'm going to go finish replaying Link to the Past,

1367
01:10:20,420 --> 01:10:21,420
but I'll see you guys later.

1368
01:10:21,420 --> 01:10:23,700
All right, that's where we are.

1369
01:10:23,700 --> 01:10:24,780
Yeah, we're in the past.

1370
01:10:24,780 --> 01:10:26,300
Say hello to Link for us.

1371
01:10:26,300 --> 01:10:28,020
Very good friend of mine.

1372
01:10:28,020 --> 01:10:30,380
Will do.

1373
01:10:30,380 --> 01:10:32,180
I pulled a toad out of my back pocket,

1374
01:10:32,180 --> 01:10:34,020
but I was sitting down on my bed.

1375
01:10:34,020 --> 01:10:35,260
So the toad is...

1376
01:10:35,260 --> 01:10:36,260
A toad's like a Mario toad?

1377
01:10:36,260 --> 01:10:38,100
- Like a frog. - Yeah, that's what I was thinking.

1378
01:10:38,100 --> 01:10:40,100
- A frog? - I know, I got a sense,

1379
01:10:40,100 --> 01:10:42,740
I heard Link and I thought Toad, Mario Toad.

1380
01:10:42,740 --> 01:10:44,260
- I pull up-- - You had a Nintendo attack.

1381
01:10:44,260 --> 01:10:46,980
- A thing of blood, just I see the blood on my hand

1382
01:10:46,980 --> 01:10:49,860
and I go, oh darn it, not again.

1383
01:10:49,860 --> 01:10:53,220
- You see Homo comes in, he says,

1384
01:10:53,220 --> 01:10:55,180
well, it's good to see all of you.

1385
01:10:55,180 --> 01:10:57,540
- Hello, Homo. - Hello.

1386
01:10:57,540 --> 01:11:00,180
- Hello, Homo. - Hello.

1387
01:11:00,180 --> 01:11:01,820
- Hey, Homo, nice to see you again.

1388
01:11:01,820 --> 01:11:03,300
- Hello, well-- - Hope there's no

1389
01:11:03,300 --> 01:11:04,820
hard feelings now that I'm a student

1390
01:11:04,820 --> 01:11:08,720
after what I, you know, I know we had kind of a rough past.

1391
01:11:08,720 --> 01:11:11,180
- Oh, it's all fine. - What do you mean rough past?

1392
01:11:11,180 --> 01:11:12,460
- What happened in the past? - He was teaching

1393
01:11:12,460 --> 01:11:14,620
a sex class to the kids.

1394
01:11:14,620 --> 01:11:16,780
- Pardon me? - What the?

1395
01:11:16,780 --> 01:11:18,340
- Yeah, we're-- - Wait.

1396
01:11:18,340 --> 01:11:20,740
- Wait a minute, he's bunking with us.

1397
01:11:20,740 --> 01:11:22,300
- Dougan, you're a teacher here,

1398
01:11:22,300 --> 01:11:26,140
so you can give me the test, the pop quiz answers, huh?

1399
01:11:26,140 --> 01:11:27,260
- Oh, I wish I could.

1400
01:11:27,260 --> 01:11:28,140
I used to be a teacher,

1401
01:11:28,140 --> 01:11:30,140
and then they kicked me down to student level.

1402
01:11:30,140 --> 01:11:31,780
- Well, what'd you used to teach?

1403
01:11:31,780 --> 01:11:35,280
Have you ever read the scroll community?

1404
01:11:35,280 --> 01:11:37,280
- Oh, I love Jeff Winger.

1405
01:11:37,280 --> 01:11:40,740
- I'm a Jeff Winger kind of character.

1406
01:11:40,740 --> 01:11:42,860
- Troy and Ebbin in the morning.

1407
01:11:42,860 --> 01:11:45,760
Yes, very funny scroll.

1408
01:11:45,760 --> 01:11:49,600
- Yeah, I really like, I was upset when they took

1409
01:11:49,600 --> 01:11:52,360
one of the stanzas of that scroll off of ScrollFlicks.

1410
01:11:52,360 --> 01:11:55,520
- Yes, yes, very annoying, very annoying.

1411
01:11:55,520 --> 01:11:58,720
- Six scrolls and a parchment.

1412
01:11:58,720 --> 01:12:00,320
I can't wait.

1413
01:12:00,320 --> 01:12:01,520
- Oh yeah.

1414
01:12:01,520 --> 01:12:04,680
My favorite scroll is the Young Sheldon.

1415
01:12:04,680 --> 01:12:09,320
- I like community, it follows the fairy circle.

1416
01:12:09,320 --> 01:12:11,440
- I don't really understand it.

1417
01:12:11,440 --> 01:12:13,480
- Every episode's a fairy circle.

1418
01:12:13,480 --> 01:12:14,920
- I don't really understand what he's saying.

1419
01:12:14,920 --> 01:12:19,920
But he has new kind of things going on every single day.

1420
01:12:19,920 --> 01:12:22,040
This Young Sheldon.

1421
01:12:22,040 --> 01:12:22,880
- All right, how about--

1422
01:12:22,880 --> 01:12:23,720
- So anyways, can I ask you to--

1423
01:12:23,720 --> 01:12:25,440
- You know, I'm gonna be honest with you, Andre.

1424
01:12:25,440 --> 01:12:27,120
You seem like the kind of guy who read,

1425
01:12:27,120 --> 01:12:29,360
who literally read the scroll,

1426
01:12:29,360 --> 01:12:32,720
read the Peppa Pig scroll once and made it his entire personality.

1427
01:12:32,720 --> 01:12:34,720
(laughing)

1428
01:12:34,720 --> 01:12:36,720
(laughing)

1429
01:12:36,720 --> 01:12:38,720
He can laugh at himself, I like that.

1430
01:12:38,720 --> 01:12:40,720
That's a good quality.

1431
01:12:40,720 --> 01:12:44,360
So, let's... you guys have to go to class now.

1432
01:12:44,360 --> 01:12:46,360

1433
01:12:46,360 --> 01:12:48,360
Wait, check this out.

1434
01:12:48,360 --> 01:12:50,360
Dylan Mulvaney.

1435
01:12:50,360 --> 01:12:53,360
What class are we going to?

1436
01:12:53,360 --> 01:12:56,360
Did I use up all of my Dylan?

1437
01:12:56,360 --> 01:12:58,360
Yeah, you gave it to him.

1438
01:12:58,360 --> 01:13:00,360
So now it just looks like I'm saying

1439
01:13:00,360 --> 01:13:03,840

1440
01:13:03,840 --> 01:13:08,480

Dylan the character just so happens you think Dylan Mulvaney is a real character

1444
01:13:25,560 --> 01:13:27,960
- Not really that much of a payoff at all.

1445
01:13:27,960 --> 01:13:29,960
- Let's go ahead and just change it, Dylan...

1446
01:13:29,960 --> 01:13:32,160
- Mulberry.

1447
01:13:32,160 --> 01:13:36,320

- Okay, 'cause it sounds like the other one, all right.

1452
01:13:43,640 --> 01:13:45,240
- Yeah.

1453
01:13:45,240 --> 01:13:48,680
- So you guys have a few classes you can go to.

1454
01:13:48,680 --> 01:13:49,840
- We get to choose?

1455
01:13:49,840 --> 01:13:52,480
- You've got-- - Potions.

1456
01:13:52,480 --> 01:13:53,680
- I gotta meet Snape.

1457
01:13:54,560 --> 01:13:56,720
- Well, the classes right now are,

1458
01:13:56,720 --> 01:14:01,480
there's a creepy magic class, a scary magic class,

1459
01:14:01,480 --> 01:14:04,840
a funny magic class, or a healthy magic class.

1460
01:14:04,840 --> 01:14:06,440
- I need to go to the funny magic class.

1461
01:14:06,440 --> 01:14:07,640
- So guys, if we go to creepy magic,

1462
01:14:07,640 --> 01:14:09,240
we're gonna meet Snape, right?

1463
01:14:09,240 --> 01:14:10,800
I need to meet the Snape.

1464
01:14:10,800 --> 01:14:11,640
- You don't need to meet Snape.

1465
01:14:11,640 --> 01:14:12,460
- Because what people don't know about the Snape

1466
01:14:12,460 --> 01:14:14,360
is he seems bad for the first six times,

1467
01:14:14,360 --> 01:14:16,280
but then in the seventh one, he's revealed to be good.

1468
01:14:16,280 --> 01:14:17,640
- I wanna meet Snape now.

1469
01:14:17,640 --> 01:14:21,400
- The teacher of the creepy magic class is Angeluna.

1470
01:14:21,400 --> 01:14:23,440
- That's Snape.

1471
01:14:23,440 --> 01:14:25,440

Hmm the snape is in the funny magic class

1475
01:14:40,360 --> 01:14:45,800
Okay, just what we don't really care about the names of the classes tell us the professors and we'll decide from there. Yeah

1476
01:14:45,800 --> 01:14:48,200

01:17:06,480 --> 01:17:07,320

1517
01:17:07,320 --> 01:17:09,780

1524
01:17:17,680 --> 01:17:18,520
- Yeah, if you wanna meet a guy--

1525
01:17:18,520 --> 01:17:19,940
- Oh no, we gotta meet someone new.

01:17:19,940 --> 01:17:22,640
- Okay, then I guess we're going to scary magic,

1527
01:17:22,640 --> 01:17:24,980
'cause I feel like scary is where a snape would be--

1528
01:17:24,980 --> 01:17:27,860
- Karen just yells, I'm gonna let you know.

1529
01:17:27,860 --> 01:17:30,820
- Okay, just pick one for us.

1530
01:17:30,820 --> 01:17:33,780

1531
01:17:33,780 --> 01:17:39,680
you go to the class, and you see the Karen, the headmaster.

1532
01:17:39,680 --> 01:17:41,180
- Oh, hell no.

1533
01:17:41,180 --> 01:17:43,180

1534
01:17:43,180 --> 01:17:47,120
- The headmaster of the, or the head of the house,

1535
01:17:47,120 --> 01:17:49,160
house of the megabats.

1536
01:17:49,160 --> 01:17:52,420
The megabats are a lost creature

1537
01:17:52,420 --> 01:17:56,120
that allegedly lives on the Isle of Gauntlet,

1538
01:17:56,120 --> 01:17:58,320
which nobody's been to for hundreds of years.

1539
01:17:58,320 --> 01:18:02,660
It's a very large island just directly east of the Dirtlands

1540
01:18:02,660 --> 01:18:04,400
if you look at the map.

1541
01:18:04,400 --> 01:18:08,900
And so she emulates the megabats

1542
01:18:08,900 --> 01:18:12,020
who are supposed to be completely pitch black with gold teeth

1543
01:18:12,020 --> 01:18:14,100
and gold fangs.

1544
01:18:14,100 --> 01:18:21,100
But she has not a Karen haircut.

1545
01:18:21,100 --> 01:18:26,100
She has sort of like a Napoleon Dynamite's grandma haircut.

1546
01:18:26,100 --> 01:18:32,980
And she sits perched on top, upside down rather,

1547
01:18:32,980 --> 01:18:36,220
and waiting in the class for all the students to come in.

1548
01:18:36,220 --> 01:18:40,300
And once you all come in, I need you guys to roll

1549
01:18:40,300 --> 01:18:43,460
a wisdom saving throw.

1550
01:18:43,460 --> 01:18:44,300
- Okay.

1551
01:18:44,300 --> 01:18:51,100
That is a nine.

1552
01:18:51,100 --> 01:18:52,780
- Ooh, I also got a nine.

1553
01:18:52,780 --> 01:18:55,060
Beautiful. - Crit one.

1554
01:18:55,060 --> 01:19:00,260
- Sorry, I heard some of this, but Karen--

1555
01:19:00,260 --> 01:19:02,340
- It's fine. - Is this attack class?

1556
01:19:02,340 --> 01:19:05,300
- No, this is scary magic. - Scary magic, okay.

1557
01:19:05,300 --> 01:19:09,580
- Scary magic often specializes in illusion magic.

1558
01:19:09,580 --> 01:19:11,620
It's things that are made to make you scared.

1559
01:19:11,620 --> 01:19:13,580
It does it on the obvious ones.

1560
01:19:13,580 --> 01:19:14,980
- I had a crit one. - That crit one.

1561
01:19:14,980 --> 01:19:16,900
- Yeah. - Yeah, it's pretty bad.

1562
01:19:16,900 --> 01:19:22,700
You see, all of you experience this illusion

1563
01:19:22,700 --> 01:19:27,320
of you are now the only one in the class.

1564
01:19:27,320 --> 01:19:31,240
And it's just you and the Karen.

1565
01:19:31,240 --> 01:19:34,340
- Oh no. - And the Karen's head

1566
01:19:34,340 --> 01:19:39,340
turns, uh, according to Exorcist style, and faces you.

1567
01:19:39,340 --> 01:19:42,620
And then from behind,

1568
01:19:42,620 --> 01:19:43,460
- Scarin'!

1569
01:19:43,460 --> 01:19:48,340
- You hear a rumbling of black tentacles

1570
01:19:48,340 --> 01:19:50,060
that sort of - Bart.

1571
01:19:50,060 --> 01:19:51,460
- Come up and grab at you,

1572
01:19:51,460 --> 01:19:53,960
and all three of you start to freak out from that.

1573
01:19:53,960 --> 01:19:56,580
And you take - Oh!

1574
01:19:56,580 --> 01:19:59,020
- 15 damage, psychic damage, from this.

1575
01:19:59,020 --> 01:20:00,580
- Oh, God. - Don't tell me we can die

1576
01:20:00,580 --> 01:20:02,380
at school, man.

1577
01:20:02,380 --> 01:20:07,460
was here early in the first day

1578
01:20:07,460 --> 01:20:09,460
fifteen

1579
01:20:09,460 --> 01:20:11,300
and you hear the carol

1580
01:20:11,300 --> 01:20:12,540
you guys hear that

1581
01:20:12,540 --> 01:20:16,420
not really

1582
01:20:16,420 --> 01:20:19,540
uh... one e uh... all of you guys role wisdom

1583
01:20:19,540 --> 01:20:21,060
just a wisdom check

1584
01:20:21,060 --> 01:20:26,140
where

1585
01:20:26,140 --> 01:20:29,740
or inside it's really inside nineteen

1586
01:20:29,740 --> 01:20:31,020
- All right, I will roll insight then.

1587
01:20:31,020 --> 01:20:31,860
- Roll insight.

1588
01:20:31,860 --> 01:20:34,020
- I got an eight. - And four.

1589
01:20:34,020 --> 01:20:35,300
- I got a 19, baby.

1590
01:20:35,300 --> 01:20:37,860
- Okay, you can understand that she is,

1591
01:20:37,860 --> 01:20:39,300
what she's basically saying is,

1592
01:20:39,300 --> 01:20:41,260
these are the kinds of things you need to

1593
01:20:41,260 --> 01:20:43,780
be able to protect yourself from.

1594
01:20:43,780 --> 01:20:47,220
From the illusions that will be cast on you.

1595
01:20:47,220 --> 01:20:53,340
She says, you can understand her at this point, that 19.

1596
01:20:53,340 --> 01:20:55,140
She says, "Okay, smart mouth."

1597
01:20:55,140 --> 01:20:58,260
I said, "Listen, bitch, I never liked you

1598
01:20:58,260 --> 01:21:00,580
when I was a teacher and this is why.

1599
01:21:00,580 --> 01:21:01,980
You're hurting the students.

1600
01:21:01,980 --> 01:21:04,780
This is unacceptable and I'm going straight

1601
01:21:04,780 --> 01:21:06,900
to the headmaster, unless you give me

1602
01:21:06,900 --> 01:21:10,220
and my crew A plus for the semester.

1603
01:21:10,220 --> 01:21:12,780
- She says you won't get an A plus

1604
01:21:12,780 --> 01:21:15,700
unless you create the scariest illusion.

1605
01:21:15,700 --> 01:21:18,300
And the thing is-- - Easy for me.

1606
01:21:18,300 --> 01:21:21,700
- Ask her what she's scared of.

1607
01:21:21,700 --> 01:21:23,340
- Yeah, what are you so scared of?

1608
01:21:23,340 --> 01:21:24,180
A real man?

1609
01:21:24,180 --> 01:21:27,420
(laughing)

1610
01:21:27,420 --> 01:21:34,600
Um she uh she regards that as she says you're on the right path

1611
01:21:34,600 --> 01:21:42,600
Creating what I do creating a scary illusion is about the context of the situation

1612
01:21:42,600 --> 01:21:49,100
You cannot just create something scary. It needs to be convincing in the context. Can I try something really quick mm-hmm I?

1613
01:21:49,100 --> 01:21:54,860
Start skateboarding

1614
01:21:55,460 --> 01:21:57,720
Okay, so Pat you want to do that in real life, right?

1615
01:21:57,720 --> 01:22:00,260
Yeah

1616
01:22:00,260 --> 01:22:03,540
Okay, I start skateboarding. No I start skateboarding

1617
01:22:03,540 --> 01:22:09,060
Because that's a Karen's natural enemy is a skateboarder. Mm-hmm

1618
01:22:09,060 --> 01:22:14,220
Do you have a skateboard you have a giant skateboard - do I

1619
01:22:14,220 --> 01:22:21,580
Know I can't conjure one because I don't have I thought I brought one with me, but why did you look around?

1620
01:22:22,700 --> 01:22:24,840
- To see if you had a skateboard.

1621
01:22:24,840 --> 01:22:27,460
Why would he ask if you had a skateboard with you?

1622
01:22:27,460 --> 01:22:28,420
- I don't know.

1623
01:22:28,420 --> 01:22:30,920
What are my spells?

1624
01:22:30,920 --> 01:22:32,940
- That's your dream question to be asked.

1625
01:22:32,940 --> 01:22:34,260
Do you have a skateboard with you right now?

1626
01:22:34,260 --> 01:22:35,100
Just curious.

1627
01:22:35,100 --> 01:22:36,700
(laughing)

1628
01:22:36,700 --> 01:22:38,740
- I guess none of my, I guess that doesn't make sense.

1629
01:22:38,740 --> 01:22:40,580
- Help, my son is stuck under a car.

1630
01:22:40,580 --> 01:22:42,420
The only way we can lift it off him and save his life

1631
01:22:42,420 --> 01:22:44,220
is if someone here has a skateboard.

1632
01:22:44,220 --> 01:22:49,380
- You'll all get like a scroll to cast like major illusions.

1633
01:22:49,380 --> 01:22:52,180
- I use channel divinity dreadful aspect.

1634
01:22:52,180 --> 01:22:53,540
- Ooh, describe that.

1635
01:22:53,540 --> 01:22:59,460
- Okay, I turn my face into someone loitering.

1636
01:22:59,460 --> 01:23:04,320
- And then I start having a barbecue with no permit.

1637
01:23:04,320 --> 01:23:09,020
- I turn my face into, I become a cashier.

1638
01:23:09,020 --> 01:23:10,980
- Okay, and what about you?

1639
01:23:10,980 --> 01:23:12,300
- And I'm ripping up coupons,

1640
01:23:12,300 --> 01:23:15,740
a cashier who's ripping up coupons and not accepting them.

1641
01:23:15,740 --> 01:23:18,920
- And I become a evil demon.

1642
01:23:18,920 --> 01:23:22,100
(laughing)

1643
01:23:22,100 --> 01:23:25,100
(imitates grunting)

1644
01:23:25,100 --> 01:23:31,080
Okay, cool.

1645
01:23:31,080 --> 01:23:35,940
And she says, "That's all very good, very good.

1646
01:23:35,940 --> 01:23:37,740
"Those are all things that scare me."

1647
01:23:37,740 --> 01:23:40,200
- All right, plus 10.

1648
01:23:40,200 --> 01:23:42,100
- So you're kind of a scaredy cat, aren't you?

1649
01:23:42,100 --> 01:23:44,540
Shouldn't really be teaching the class now, should you?

1650
01:23:44,540 --> 01:23:47,420
Maybe let's step aside, let a real teacher take over.

1651
01:23:47,420 --> 01:23:49,620
- She's afraid of a barbecue with no permit.

1652
01:23:49,620 --> 01:23:56,300
Let's get one of your own students fellow students up here, and you see watch a scary Joe. Oh god Roger

1653
01:23:56,300 --> 01:23:58,980
Clemens I didn't even meet this guy yet

1654
01:23:58,980 --> 01:24:03,020
But I'm just getting an awful vibe off him and when I walk back from the front of the class I smack him on the

1655
01:24:03,020 --> 01:24:05,020
back of the word

1656
01:24:05,020 --> 01:24:08,020
Huh, you never taught him. Oh, it's for he's the first year I

You're 10 feet tall yeah

1660
01:24:22,540 --> 01:24:25,300
He just falls under you

1661
01:24:25,300 --> 01:24:27,580
But then you flop onto his body

1662
01:24:27,580 --> 01:24:32,200
We've table top you Roger Clemens

1663
01:24:32,200 --> 01:24:36,180
Suddenly all three of you can't move oh

shit and

1665
01:24:39,140 --> 01:24:46,580
Karen says you're going to have to stay here for the remainder of the class and just watch

1666
01:24:46,580 --> 01:24:51,700
And you all guys we were set because we already pissed so good

Come on, man. What could we table could we bullied that guy?

1669
01:25:02,520 --> 01:25:06,860
He clearly is gonna bully us for as well. We have to bully him first

1670
01:25:06,860 --> 01:25:09,460
Yeah, not not in the class

1671
01:25:09,460 --> 01:25:12,820
You guys can pick another class that I go to today. This is a woke

1672
01:25:13,460 --> 01:25:19,660
School this is it. I'll say let's go to school. Let's what else is it. Are they doing are they doing attacking yet?

1673
01:25:19,660 --> 01:25:21,700
Not yet

1674
01:25:21,700 --> 01:25:27,540
Okay, let's go to helping okay. Wait. You said it's persona like a second helping

1675
01:25:27,540 --> 01:25:30,620

So you see guest on?

1677
01:25:32,620 --> 01:25:35,060
He waits for you

1678
01:25:35,060 --> 01:25:37,860
and

1679
01:25:37,860 --> 01:25:43,620
You guys are all there and his classroom is in the spire for the kaiju manji

1680
01:25:43,620 --> 01:25:50,720
So has all these weird eerie drawings and weird sort of vibe to it, and he says now

1681
01:25:50,720 --> 01:25:54,860
We're going to hello. We're going to have to teach you about

1682
01:25:54,860 --> 01:25:58,280
withstanding pain teacher

1683
01:25:58,280 --> 01:26:02,460
Teacher is not about you must think

1684
01:26:02,460 --> 01:26:06,820
Hello, Lee. Hello. I need to use the bathroom

1685
01:26:06,820 --> 01:26:09,820
You may use the bathroom.

1686
01:26:09,820 --> 01:26:10,820
Yippee!

1687
01:26:10,820 --> 01:26:13,820
They're probably gender neutral in this damn school.

1688
01:26:13,820 --> 01:26:14,820
Yeah.

1689
01:26:14,820 --> 01:26:16,820
They run out of the classroom.

1690
01:26:16,820 --> 01:26:18,820
They are most certainly not.

1691
01:26:18,820 --> 01:26:20,820
Well that's good news.

1692
01:26:20,820 --> 01:26:24,820
There's only one gender, man.

1693
01:26:24,820 --> 01:26:26,820
And everyone has to figure it out.

1694
01:26:26,820 --> 01:26:29,820
Man and giant.

1695
01:26:29,820 --> 01:26:30,820
Yeah.

1696
01:26:30,820 --> 01:26:33,820
He says, uh...

1697
01:26:33,820 --> 01:26:35,820
He was wearing a dress all along.

1698
01:26:35,820 --> 01:26:37,820
When he walked away from the camera.

1699
01:26:37,820 --> 01:26:41,820
...and constant increasing damage.

1700
01:26:41,820 --> 01:26:43,820
I'm going to be attacking you.

1701
01:26:43,820 --> 01:26:45,820
You will be revived. You will not die.

1702
01:26:45,820 --> 01:26:50,820
But you will be taking damage and you must figure out a way to withstand it.

1703
01:26:50,820 --> 01:26:51,820
Easy.

1704
01:26:51,820 --> 01:26:58,820
Who, well, former professor, would you like to try first if it's so easy for you?

1705
01:26:58,820 --> 01:27:01,820
If it's so easy for me, why don't I try last just so...

1706
01:27:01,820 --> 01:27:03,820
[laughter]

1707
01:27:03,820 --> 01:27:08,820
It's a good point. I'm like I'm thinking it's gonna be pretty hard for me, so I'll go fast

1708
01:27:08,820 --> 01:27:11,740
Okay, cool

1709
01:27:11,740 --> 01:27:19,660
All right, and so he shoots a constant stream of which bolt at you. Yep. It's really hurting me really really badly

1710
01:27:19,660 --> 01:27:22,620
You're gonna take

1711
01:27:22,620 --> 01:27:29,700
Well wait you have a resistance to magic right yes, I think you do you don't know I do

1712
01:27:31,260 --> 01:27:37,020
Yes, nice. Yeah, you should have make sure I'm getting it correctly. I'm back from the bathroom

1713
01:27:37,020 --> 01:27:41,000
Let me see

1714
01:27:41,000 --> 01:27:44,700
What happened while I was gone

1715
01:27:44,700 --> 01:27:50,980
Nothing I advantage on saving throws against spells another magical effect. So if it is which bolt which bolt does

1716
01:27:50,980 --> 01:27:56,120
If I'm correct, is that an attacking spell right though? That's actually an attack

1717
01:27:56,120 --> 01:27:57,700
- Okay, let's check.

1718
01:27:57,700 --> 01:27:58,540
Um...

1719
01:27:58,540 --> 01:28:03,260
You were to the saving throw.

1720
01:28:03,260 --> 01:28:04,100
No, it's on a hit.

1721
01:28:04,100 --> 01:28:05,080
So this will just hit you,

1722
01:28:05,080 --> 01:28:07,680
so you don't have advantage on the dodging this, so.

1723
01:28:07,680 --> 01:28:08,520
- Okay.

1724
01:28:08,520 --> 01:28:14,100
- So you're gonna take first 1d12 damage.

1725
01:28:14,100 --> 01:28:17,000
- You roll or I roll?

1726
01:28:17,000 --> 01:28:18,040
- I roll that.

1727
01:28:18,040 --> 01:28:20,400
(Burps)

1728
01:28:20,400 --> 01:28:24,160
So you take 11 first.

1729
01:28:24,160 --> 01:28:27,240
Yep, really heading very badly.

1730
01:28:27,240 --> 01:28:28,760
- So now what do you wanna do?

1731
01:28:28,760 --> 01:28:29,800
You have this moment.

1732
01:28:29,800 --> 01:28:34,120
- I'd like to sit here and continue taking damage.

1733
01:28:34,120 --> 01:28:37,560
- There's nothing you wanna do?

1734
01:28:37,560 --> 01:28:39,800
- Well, I'm not gonna fight my professor, right?

1735
01:28:39,800 --> 01:28:40,640
- You don't have to fight,

1736
01:28:40,640 --> 01:28:42,120
you have to just withstand the damage.

1737
01:28:42,120 --> 01:28:43,760
- Oh, hmm.

1738
01:28:43,760 --> 01:28:45,000
- Or find a way to do it.

1739
01:28:45,000 --> 01:28:47,560
Look through your spells.

1740
01:28:47,560 --> 01:28:48,680
- Yeah, let's see.

1741
01:28:48,680 --> 01:28:51,340
- Feel free to ask questions of him as well.

1742
01:28:51,340 --> 01:28:53,420
(sniffs)

1743
01:28:53,420 --> 01:28:56,580
- Hmm, I have an odd question.

1744
01:28:56,580 --> 01:28:58,200
Might come across as odd at least.

1745
01:28:58,200 --> 01:29:00,080
Is there any plants in this room?

1746
01:29:00,080 --> 01:29:02,980
- Yes, there are.

1747
01:29:02,980 --> 01:29:03,820
- Okay.

1748
01:29:03,820 --> 01:29:05,340
- There are a few plants that are like

1749
01:29:05,340 --> 01:29:07,200
kind of nice little window dressing.

1750
01:29:07,200 --> 01:29:10,020
- I would like to use plant growth

1751
01:29:10,020 --> 01:29:12,460
to grow them into a shield in front of my body.

1752
01:29:12,460 --> 01:29:19,620
'Cause there's no way this magic is gonna go through plants.

1753
01:29:21,060 --> 01:29:24,500
Spill rate are you let me see possible use of spell granting me on it

1754
01:29:24,500 --> 01:29:31,100
We choose a plant within range all normal plants become thick and overgrown creature moving to the area must spend four feet

1755
01:29:31,100 --> 01:29:37,180
Okay, I like you trying to do that. Let's we'll have you do that. Okay, I can stand

1756
01:29:37,180 --> 01:29:40,180
You casted it and then

1757
01:29:40,180 --> 01:29:44,980
We think I think that gives you let's say three-fourths cover

1758
01:29:46,820 --> 01:29:52,600
Well, no, and so well, let's say it withstand it it cuts off some of the damage and

1759
01:29:52,600 --> 01:29:58,860
He says to you Gaston stop shooting the whip which bullet you and he says that is correct

1760
01:29:58,860 --> 01:30:04,300
Remember when you were talking about helping people and healthy magic

1761
01:30:04,300 --> 01:30:10,540
Only healing will not stop it. You must create shields

1762
01:30:10,540 --> 01:30:16,300
you must stop the source if you just restore your health with curing wounds and

1763
01:30:16,300 --> 01:30:21,300
and healing words, you'll eventually run out.

1764
01:30:21,300 --> 01:30:24,740
- Sorry, can't quite hear you through these plants,

1765
01:30:24,740 --> 01:30:26,000
you'll need to speak up.

1766
01:30:26,000 --> 01:30:29,060
- You did well, is what I'm saying.

1767
01:30:29,060 --> 01:30:30,660
- All right, back to the seat.

1768
01:30:30,660 --> 01:30:36,620
- So you will get a, you will retain that spell slot

1769
01:30:36,620 --> 01:30:41,220
as sort of your reward for passing that lesson.

1770
01:30:41,220 --> 01:30:42,860
- All right, I undid it.

1771
01:30:42,860 --> 01:30:44,780
- Yeah, nice.

1772
01:30:45,700 --> 01:30:51,320
Typically one of the rewards you get is like an additional spell slot or like a pool of d6s and things like that

1773
01:30:51,320 --> 01:30:53,640
So you're gonna retain it for that one

1774
01:30:53,640 --> 01:30:57,060
Now

1775
01:30:57,060 --> 01:30:59,940
It is time for attacking class oh

1776
01:30:59,940 --> 01:31:02,740
Yeah, so excited

1777
01:31:02,740 --> 01:31:05,460
you guys I

1778
01:31:05,460 --> 01:31:10,780
Have to go outside for that. It's now closer to night. You see the stars rooms and all that

1779
01:31:10,780 --> 01:31:14,100
Quidditch I just remembered quit it rug be man

1780
01:31:14,820 --> 01:31:18,020
And you go in towards the gymnasium slash

1781
01:31:18,020 --> 01:31:24,740
Combat center of combat and all that where you see wizards practicing spells of one another crafting magical weapons

1782
01:31:24,740 --> 01:31:28,980
all these things you're led towards the back area where there's sort of a

1783
01:31:28,980 --> 01:31:32,100
dirt dirt arena

1784
01:31:32,100 --> 01:31:34,580
and you see a

1785
01:31:34,580 --> 01:31:39,260
Sort of a long-haired

1786
01:31:40,780 --> 01:31:48,100
Sort of sharp featured looking teacher. He had not seen the snake snake snake and his name is

1787
01:31:48,100 --> 01:31:51,420
Professor Aquaman and

1788
01:31:51,420 --> 01:31:54,740
He looks you all

1789
01:31:54,740 --> 01:31:58,440
And he says my name is Professor Aquaman

1790
01:31:58,440 --> 01:32:01,940
It's not snake. I

1791
01:32:01,940 --> 01:32:07,620
Have a groundskeeper. I am the attacking class professor and

1792
01:32:08,500 --> 01:32:12,240
And I'm here to teach all of you how to defend yourselves.

1793
01:32:12,240 --> 01:32:15,100
And at this point, the entire first year student body is here.

1794
01:32:15,100 --> 01:32:19,120
This is the most important part of Berry Berry Academy,

1795
01:32:19,120 --> 01:32:21,800
is learning how to kill and not be killed.

1796
01:32:21,800 --> 01:32:25,740
Don't let any other professor tell you otherwise.

1797
01:32:25,740 --> 01:32:30,620
Now, who wishes to fight this demon I have summoned?

1798
01:32:30,620 --> 01:32:31,900
And he summons a demon.

1799
01:32:31,900 --> 01:32:35,620
Who wants to fight him?

1800
01:32:37,620 --> 01:32:38,460
I did the last one.

1801
01:32:38,460 --> 01:32:40,740
- Oh, I think this guy does.

1802
01:32:40,740 --> 01:32:42,580
I'm pointing to Andre.

1803
01:32:42,580 --> 01:32:44,140
- Yeah, he hates Damon.

1804
01:32:44,140 --> 01:32:44,980
- Go fish.

1805
01:32:44,980 --> 01:32:45,820
- Go fish.

1806
01:32:45,820 --> 01:32:53,740
- You, Andre Behavoir, come on up.

1807
01:32:53,740 --> 01:32:55,140
- All right.

1808
01:32:55,140 --> 01:32:58,900
- And I unleash primal savagery.

1809
01:32:58,900 --> 01:33:00,540
- Okay, let's roll initiative.

1810
01:33:00,540 --> 01:33:02,380
- You unleash primal savagery.

1811
01:33:02,380 --> 01:33:04,620
(laughing)

1812
01:33:04,620 --> 01:33:05,460
- I unleash primal savagery.

1813
01:33:05,460 --> 01:33:07,020
- And I unleash primal savagery.

1814
01:33:07,020 --> 01:33:10,100
- At least Primal Savagery and I got a 15 on it.

1815
01:33:10,100 --> 01:33:12,340
- Dillon is like sitting in front of a TV right now

1816
01:33:12,340 --> 01:33:14,900
and his stomach growls, he's like oh.

1817
01:33:14,900 --> 01:33:16,260
- Primal Savagery. - Something happened.

1818
01:33:16,260 --> 01:33:17,100
- Yeah.

1819
01:33:17,100 --> 01:33:24,180
So Primal Savagery is just, that's just like,

1820
01:33:24,180 --> 01:33:29,180
so that's a, so you're gonna make a melee attack on him?

1821
01:33:29,180 --> 01:33:30,700
Well let's first roll initiative

1822
01:33:30,700 --> 01:33:32,500
to see if you go first or not.

1823
01:33:32,500 --> 01:33:33,340
- All right.

1824
01:33:36,340 --> 01:33:37,740
- Well then I have to roll again.

1825
01:33:37,740 --> 01:33:38,580
- Crap.

1826
01:33:38,580 --> 01:33:40,940
- What'd they get?

1827
01:33:40,940 --> 01:33:42,180
(gasps)

1828
01:33:42,180 --> 01:33:43,020
- Six.

1829
01:33:43,020 --> 01:33:44,180
- I don't know.

1830
01:33:44,180 --> 01:33:45,020
- Got a six.

1831
01:33:45,020 --> 01:33:45,840
- Looks like a six.

1832
01:33:45,840 --> 01:33:46,820
This demon is gonna go first.

1833
01:33:46,820 --> 01:33:48,840
- Wait, I got a six.

1834
01:33:48,840 --> 01:33:49,940
- Yeah, I said that.

1835
01:33:49,940 --> 01:33:52,260
- I got a six.

1836
01:33:52,260 --> 01:33:53,700
- Yeah, that's what everyone said.

1837
01:33:53,700 --> 01:33:54,740
- That's what he's saying.

1838
01:33:54,740 --> 01:33:56,380
- Wait, I thought the demon got a six.

1839
01:33:56,380 --> 01:33:57,220
- No, no, no, no.

1840
01:33:57,220 --> 01:33:58,620
- You can see your rolls, man.

1841
01:33:58,620 --> 01:33:59,460
- Oh.

1842
01:33:59,460 --> 01:34:03,060
- Yeah, so this horrible demon,

1843
01:34:03,060 --> 01:34:08,060
Um, yeah, this is gonna be cool.

1844
01:34:08,060 --> 01:34:17,060
Um, he, uh, zooms towards you and raises his hand atop, on your head.

1845
01:34:17,060 --> 01:34:20,060
He, like, jumps in the air, places his hand on your head.

1846
01:34:20,060 --> 01:34:22,060
And...

1847
01:34:22,060 --> 01:34:26,060
What is your AC?

1848
01:34:26,060 --> 01:34:28,060
Twelve.

1849
01:34:28,060 --> 01:34:29,060
Yeah.

1850
01:34:29,060 --> 01:34:30,060
Isn't it?

1851
01:34:30,060 --> 01:34:30,900
- I'm not liking it.

1852
01:34:30,900 --> 01:34:34,860
Yeah, and he does,

1853
01:34:34,860 --> 01:34:38,500
put his hand on your head and you feel a cold,

1854
01:34:38,500 --> 01:34:42,660
numbing touch sort of drip into your skull

1855
01:34:42,660 --> 01:34:47,120
and fill it with an icy, just cold pain.

1856
01:34:47,120 --> 01:34:48,900
- Ouch.

1857
01:34:48,900 --> 01:34:50,420
- Yeah. (laughs)

1858
01:34:50,420 --> 01:34:52,620
And you take 14 damage.

1859
01:34:52,620 --> 01:34:57,700
- Does he have bigger blood than us too?

1860
01:34:58,860 --> 01:35:00,260
You can see the blood cells.

1861
01:35:00,260 --> 01:35:01,660
And they're bigger?

1862
01:35:01,660 --> 01:35:03,260
Macroscopic blood cells.

1863
01:35:03,260 --> 01:35:04,300
All right, good to know.

1864
01:35:04,300 --> 01:35:07,460
All right, well, I got a 15 on the primal savagery.

1865
01:35:07,460 --> 01:35:09,780
Mm-hmm.

1866
01:35:09,780 --> 01:35:11,020
All right, cool.

1867
01:35:11,020 --> 01:35:12,140
What was that, nine damage?

1868
01:35:12,140 --> 01:35:16,220
That's 14.

1869
01:35:16,220 --> 01:35:17,860
Well, what are you talking about?

1870
01:35:17,860 --> 01:35:19,940
What are you talking about?

1871
01:35:19,940 --> 01:35:22,500
I was trying to roll my hit.

1872
01:35:22,500 --> 01:35:23,780
I guess I'll just roll it again.

1873
01:35:26,500 --> 01:35:27,540
That's the damage.

1874
01:35:27,540 --> 01:35:30,260
- What?

1875
01:35:30,260 --> 01:35:32,480
Oh wait, I'll roll damages.

1876
01:35:32,480 --> 01:35:34,520
It says acid damage 20.

1877
01:35:34,520 --> 01:35:38,820
(laughing)

1878
01:35:38,820 --> 01:35:40,780
- What's happening?

1879
01:35:40,780 --> 01:35:42,300
- What's going on man, you good?

1880
01:35:42,300 --> 01:35:43,500
- I don't know what is happening.

1881
01:35:43,500 --> 01:35:45,020
- Oh okay, yeah, fine.

1882
01:35:45,020 --> 01:35:47,660
- I rolled two D10s and I got two 10s.

1883
01:35:47,660 --> 01:35:49,980
- That's good, no you did that right, okay yeah.

1884
01:35:49,980 --> 01:35:52,640
So describe, when you grow claws and stuff,

1885
01:35:52,640 --> 01:35:55,380
what does it look like for your Ferrandri-Betisbois?

1886
01:35:55,380 --> 01:35:58,580
My hair.

1887
01:35:58,580 --> 01:35:59,780
Your claws?

1888
01:35:59,780 --> 01:36:01,180
That's probably more savagery.

1889
01:36:01,180 --> 01:36:03,980
My hair grows claws out of it, my long hair.

1890
01:36:03,980 --> 01:36:04,940
Mm-hmm.

1891
01:36:04,940 --> 01:36:06,540
And it goes up like this.

1892
01:36:06,540 --> 01:36:09,500
You kind of remind me of Hagrid.

1893
01:36:09,500 --> 01:36:11,660
Nice. Yeah.

1894
01:36:11,660 --> 01:36:14,940
And then the claws come out of the hair,

1895
01:36:14,940 --> 01:36:20,460
and the hair grows and then turns into big, hairy, claw hands.

1896
01:36:20,460 --> 01:36:24,420
And they're dripping with acid, apparently.

1897
01:36:24,420 --> 01:36:25,260
- Nice.

1898
01:36:25,260 --> 01:36:28,720
Yeah, and you just slash at him.

1899
01:36:28,720 --> 01:36:32,440
And you see a Kwaman, he's like,

1900
01:36:32,440 --> 01:36:34,360
"Yes, there we go, finally,

1901
01:36:34,360 --> 01:36:37,320
"a student with some fucking balls."

1902
01:36:37,320 --> 01:36:41,640
And now the demon lurches back,

1903
01:36:41,640 --> 01:36:45,900
and he tries to shoot some kind of fire beam at you.

1904
01:36:45,900 --> 01:36:48,320
- And I dodge it perfectly.

1905
01:36:48,320 --> 01:36:50,320
- You do, actually.

1906
01:36:50,320 --> 01:36:51,160
You do dodge it.

1907
01:36:51,160 --> 01:36:54,500
- Shoots by you and you're able to sidestep it easily.

1908
01:36:54,500 --> 01:36:56,600
(laughing)

1909
01:36:56,600 --> 01:36:57,440
Yeah, and he shoots another--

1910
01:36:57,440 --> 01:36:58,800
- You think you can shoot me with that shit, bitch?

1911
01:36:58,800 --> 01:37:01,960
- He shoots another one and he crit fails.

1912
01:37:01,960 --> 01:37:05,240
And the fire gets like caught up in his skull

1913
01:37:05,240 --> 01:37:07,600
where you're shooting at him from like (roaring)

1914
01:37:07,600 --> 01:37:10,000
so you have advantage in your next attack against him.

1915
01:37:10,000 --> 01:37:14,760
- All right, then I am going to use

1916
01:37:20,160 --> 01:37:22,160
Vicious mockery

1917
01:37:22,160 --> 01:37:26,120
Nice just to make a wisdom saving throw

1918
01:37:26,120 --> 01:37:31,360
Wait, I have to roll that so let me see what the wisdom saving throw would be for this guy

1919
01:37:31,360 --> 01:37:39,520
Wait, did I roll that correctly? I can't tell he did. Okay, you don't have to roll any seven. That's the damage you're gonna do

1920
01:37:39,520 --> 01:37:46,220
Okay, depending on how he does his wisdom saving throw here, which yeah, he's kind of wise

1921
01:37:46,220 --> 01:37:49,360
Let's see

1922
01:37:49,360 --> 01:37:54,360
Yeah, he does save. What do you say though, trying to mock him?

1923
01:37:54,360 --> 01:37:56,360
Pork chop.

1924
01:37:56,360 --> 01:38:00,360
Pretty cool.

1925
01:38:00,360 --> 01:38:02,360
Pretty cool.

1926
01:38:02,360 --> 01:38:04,360
You friggin' pork chop.

1927
01:38:04,360 --> 01:38:07,360
You look like a pork chop.

1928
01:38:07,360 --> 01:38:12,360
Cool. And, yeah...

1929
01:38:12,360 --> 01:38:15,360
Do you get half damage or no?

1930
01:38:17,360 --> 01:38:24,880
or take yeah no it doesn't take half damage so just succeeds and it's head it

1931
01:38:24,880 --> 01:38:28,520
recovers and it goes and runs up to try to attack you again the same way it just

1932
01:38:28,520 --> 01:38:40,600
did it got a great oh my god I'm dead okay we don't know that yet man chill

1933
01:38:40,600 --> 01:38:46,400
yeah so you are knocked out okay you're dead you're dead buddy you can't die in

1934
01:38:46,400 --> 01:38:47,420
- In school though, you already said that.

1935
01:38:47,420 --> 01:38:49,580
- No, no, no, the teacher's gonna revive you.

1936
01:38:49,580 --> 01:38:54,260
The teacher revives you, you're back at full HP.

1937
01:38:54,260 --> 01:38:57,020
And he says, "Why did you use," whoops, the wrong voice.

1938
01:38:57,020 --> 01:38:59,380
"Why did you use one of your cantrips?"

1939
01:38:59,380 --> 01:39:05,940
Do you not have stronger spells?

1940
01:39:05,940 --> 01:39:08,280
- Oh.

1941
01:39:08,280 --> 01:39:09,560
- You tried to mock the enemy

1942
01:39:09,560 --> 01:39:12,140
without fully understanding how to kill him.

1943
01:39:12,140 --> 01:39:13,980
Never do that.

1944
01:39:13,980 --> 01:39:18,140
Well, I just wanted to say something very mean.

1945
01:39:18,140 --> 01:39:19,140
[Swoosh]

1946
01:39:19,140 --> 01:39:23,140
Get this giant out of my sight.

1947
01:39:23,140 --> 01:39:24,140
Which one?

1948
01:39:24,140 --> 01:39:27,140
Me? Him? Him? Or me?

1949
01:39:27,140 --> 01:39:28,140
You've got potential.

1950
01:39:28,140 --> 01:39:29,140
I think you're talking about me.

1951
01:39:29,140 --> 01:39:32,140
And nothing I hate more than failed potential.

1952
01:39:32,140 --> 01:39:35,140
And then, nothing. Really nothing.

1953
01:39:35,140 --> 01:39:37,140
Hitler. Fine.

1954
01:39:37,140 --> 01:39:40,140
And then you hear a whoosh.

1955
01:39:40,140 --> 01:39:41,140
And you hear a splash.

1956
01:39:41,140 --> 01:39:42,140
Hitler exists.

1957
01:39:42,140 --> 01:39:43,140
Hitler, fine.

1958
01:39:43,140 --> 01:39:45,400
(laughing)

1959
01:39:45,400 --> 01:39:46,640
- I hate Hitler.

1960
01:39:46,640 --> 01:39:49,600
- Hitler find the lost stooge.

1961
01:39:49,600 --> 01:39:52,800
The lost brother of Moe and Curly.

1962
01:39:52,800 --> 01:39:54,680
- And all of a sudden,

1963
01:39:54,680 --> 01:39:59,360
these serpents, winged serpents,

1964
01:39:59,360 --> 01:40:03,040
fly up from the water beneath the lake.

1965
01:40:03,040 --> 01:40:03,880
- Wait, what does?

1966
01:40:03,880 --> 01:40:06,360
- The pond, winged serpents.

1967
01:40:06,360 --> 01:40:10,640
And they crash into the arena.

1968
01:40:10,640 --> 01:40:12,720
The other students run and panic.

1969
01:40:12,720 --> 01:40:14,600
- Not us.

1970
01:40:14,600 --> 01:40:18,840
- You're not gonna fool us here, Mr. Crazy.

1971
01:40:18,840 --> 01:40:20,160
- And-- - Snape.

1972
01:40:20,160 --> 01:40:21,000
- What's his name?

1973
01:40:21,000 --> 01:40:22,360
- Mr. Snape. - He's running the train.

1974
01:40:22,360 --> 01:40:23,200
- Snape.

1975
01:40:23,200 --> 01:40:26,680
- And Aquaman--

1976
01:40:26,680 --> 01:40:29,240
- I know this is just one of your little tricks.

1977
01:40:29,240 --> 01:40:32,440
I'm gonna walk up to him, he can kill me if he wants to.

1978
01:40:32,440 --> 01:40:33,680
- I walk right up to the serpent.

1979
01:40:33,680 --> 01:40:36,760
- He says, "I need to get these students to safety.

1980
01:40:36,760 --> 01:40:39,000
"You need to take care of these serpents."

1981
01:40:40,360 --> 01:40:45,120
What what we get your safety and you kill the fucking joy it's nice

1982
01:40:45,120 --> 01:40:49,160
No

1983
01:40:49,160 --> 01:40:51,800
He takes the students

1984
01:40:51,800 --> 01:40:54,320
I'm reporting you to the headmaster as well by the time

1985
01:40:54,320 --> 01:40:58,800
I'm done with my first week at school there will be no teachers left because everyone is wronging me in some way or another

1986
01:40:58,800 --> 01:41:04,000
And you just moved to the top of my shit list, but he just are screaming because I'm a teacher

1987
01:41:09,280 --> 01:41:10,920
People are getting eaten a bit.

1988
01:41:10,920 --> 01:41:13,800
You're just like, just 'cause I didn't get tenure

1989
01:41:13,800 --> 01:41:15,400
and you did, like yeah.

1990
01:41:15,400 --> 01:41:19,680
And next time we will see how that battle goes.

1991
01:41:19,680 --> 01:41:23,260
But before we sign off here,

1992
01:41:23,260 --> 01:41:26,220
I have to finish our Marlon Rees story.

1993
01:41:26,220 --> 01:41:31,640
So, we saw the beginning of his story,

1994
01:41:31,640 --> 01:41:33,280
we saw how he got this job.

1995
01:41:33,280 --> 01:41:37,120
Now we're back to where he was descending.

1996
01:41:37,120 --> 01:41:39,120
Further and further from the mine proper,

1997
01:41:39,120 --> 01:41:44,240
Marlon finds himself in a darkness that disallows a positional awareness.

1998
01:41:44,240 --> 01:41:48,620
Bearings were not to be had, only rock, crag, cut, scratch,

1999
01:41:48,620 --> 01:41:52,960
downward slip, scrape, crack, another, tucking his tail and cursing.

2000
01:41:52,960 --> 01:41:57,160
His headgear was alternating between orange outlines, muted blues, and harsh reds.

2001
01:41:57,160 --> 01:42:01,460
The outlines were flickering, almost uncertain how to assess all the dangers present.

2002
01:42:01,460 --> 01:42:07,120
After heaving himself down through this final, near 90-degree decline,

2003
01:42:07,120 --> 01:42:10,960
Martin's foot missed a step, sorry, Marlin's foot missed a step,

2004
01:42:10,960 --> 01:42:13,760
and crashed to a softer mound of rubble and loose stone.

2005
01:42:13,760 --> 01:42:18,400
In an instant, he plunged to a wide berth that seemed to go on endless.

2006
01:42:18,400 --> 01:42:24,000
This could be it. But the impact, while knocking the wind out of him, was

2007
01:42:24,000 --> 01:42:27,920
buoyed by a bed of soft, glowing crystals.

2008
01:42:27,920 --> 01:42:32,000
As he came to his senses, Marlin could see that this bed was like a

2009
01:42:32,000 --> 01:42:36,240
mycorrhizal network, an eerie,

2010
01:42:36,240 --> 01:42:41,580
undulating blanket of soft crystal with remnants of delicate edges that once a

2011
01:42:41,580 --> 01:42:48,000
prism made but now they gleamed against an unknown light that emanates from all

2012
01:42:48,000 --> 01:42:53,440
the crystals. There will be blood. His headgear however was clear as to what he

2013
01:42:53,440 --> 01:42:57,840
had landed on as each and every inch of the soft crystal bed was outlined with a

2014
01:42:57,840 --> 01:43:04,600
harsh red. These things are dangerous. Marlon recombobulated and took in the

2015
01:43:04,600 --> 01:43:10,240
sight before him. He reached for the magical container given to him by Poonhead and went

2016
01:43:10,240 --> 01:43:18,360
to take a handful of the soft crystals, like small pods of flesh or dry worms. As he went

2017
01:43:18,360 --> 01:43:23,840
to place these things into the container, the sigil on his head lamp glowed more and more

2018
01:43:23,840 --> 01:43:28,200
wildly. It was no longer staying on those red outlines, it was shifting into black light,

2019
01:43:28,200 --> 01:43:33,600
freaky purples and yellows and greens. A variety of greens, maybe all of the greens, from the

2020
01:43:33,600 --> 01:43:39,440
earthy to the neon. The headlamp began to jitter and Marlon's vision became a skull

2021
01:43:39,440 --> 01:43:43,800
rattling blur. He took it off and placed it atop the crystal bed but when he did

2022
01:43:43,800 --> 01:43:48,840
it rattled more and the colors grew increasingly mad. The crystal shimmered

2023
01:43:48,840 --> 01:43:54,160
and he felt the bed before him give and envelop and he began to sink and sink

2024
01:43:54,160 --> 01:44:02,840
and then sink. And maybe we'll find out if what that even fucking means next time.

2025
01:44:02,840 --> 01:44:04,840
He will abandon his child.

2026
01:44:04,840 --> 01:44:06,840
Wow.

2027
01:44:06,840 --> 01:44:08,840
He will have two twins.

2028
01:44:08,840 --> 01:44:10,840
Next time on...

2029
01:44:10,840 --> 01:44:12,840
Rodogon you.

2030
01:44:12,840 --> 01:44:14,840
And the

2031
01:44:14,840 --> 01:44:16,840
Soft Philosopher's Crystal.

2032
01:44:16,840 --> 01:44:18,840
Wow.

2033
01:44:18,840 --> 01:44:20,840
That's a great name.

2034
01:44:20,840 --> 01:44:22,840
Soft Philosopher's?

2035
01:44:22,840 --> 01:44:24,840
Soft Philosopher.

2036
01:44:24,840 --> 01:44:26,840
I'm stopping recording.

2037
01:44:26,840 --> 01:44:28,840
Feel softing.

2038
01:44:28,840 --> 01:44:30,840
Feel softer than a crystal.

2039
01:44:30,840 --> 01:44:34,200
(Sound of a vacuum cleaner)

2040
01:44:34,200 --> 01:44:37,880
1992, that would be a good year because you can get put in the nines,

2041
01:44:37,880 --> 01:44:41,880
but you wouldn't see these people have 1991. Oh, they were patented in 1992?

2042
01:44:41,880 --> 01:44:44,840
That's exactly what I said, 1992 would be a good year.

2043
01:44:44,840 --> 01:44:49,640
Yeah, yeah, the 90s make sense. But this is, this is, this is complicated.

2044
01:44:49,640 --> 01:44:52,920
This is fussy. Like this is too much going on. No, you know what? Here's my thing. I think

2045
01:44:52,920 --> 01:44:57,320
the night, these, these 1991, 1992 glasses, wait, they said they were invented in 1992.

2046
01:44:57,320 --> 01:45:00,200
to this woman's wearing 1991. That woman is a time traveler. That's

2047
01:45:00,200 --> 01:45:04,200
fake. I don't believe that that exists. But here's what I'm saying.

2048
01:45:04,200 --> 01:45:08,280
The 1991, 1992 glasses, these have had to have been invented by either

2049
01:45:08,280 --> 01:45:11,500
a time traveler or a schizophrenic person, because who looks at the

2050
01:45:11,500 --> 01:45:15,880
number 1992 and says, "Oh, glasses." Yeah. I wanna make... 2000, you're

2051
01:45:15,880 --> 01:45:20,360
like, "Oh, glasses. Glasses are handcuffs or bubble wrap." Would be

2052
01:45:20,360 --> 01:45:25,240
great to merge this off of, but 1992 is a psycho number to look at

2053
01:45:25,240 --> 01:45:27,240
look at this guy wearing the 1998 glasses.

2054
01:45:27,240 --> 01:45:29,240
Is that Badlands Booker?

2055
01:45:29,240 --> 01:45:31,240
That's Jerry Lewis.

2056
01:45:31,240 --> 01:45:33,240
Right there, that's Jerry Lewis.

2057
01:45:33,240 --> 01:45:35,240
But look at this.

2058
01:45:35,240 --> 01:45:37,240
This is like when

2059
01:45:37,240 --> 01:45:39,240
you know somebody that's got a dog

2060
01:45:39,240 --> 01:45:41,240
that should be dead.

2061
01:45:41,240 --> 01:45:43,240
It's like, oh yeah, that dog's been alive.

2062
01:45:43,240 --> 01:45:45,240
Stolen hours. Yeah.

2063
01:45:45,240 --> 01:45:47,240
It's like, oh yeah, this is my 34 year old dog.

2064
01:45:47,240 --> 01:45:49,240
Yeah. That's what these glasses are.

2065
01:45:49,240 --> 01:45:51,240
We gotta put them down.

2066
01:45:51,240 --> 01:45:53,240
It's time to put them down until it's time for them to come back to life.

2067
01:45:53,240 --> 01:45:57,880
feed we're gonna feed the dog a Big Mac with the we're gonna feed these glasses
