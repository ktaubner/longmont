Okay.

6
00:00:13,300 --> 00:00:15,300
*scary noises*

7
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:17,300
Okay, so I-

8
00:00:17,300 --> 00:00:19,300
*laughter*

9
00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:21,300
The scary bug!

10
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:23,300
*scary noises*

11
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:25,300
The little cockroach!

12
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:27,300
*scary noises*

13
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:29,300
*scary noises*

14
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:36,300
bug is in my home I don't want to be home alone. The scary bug is on the crawl. I really thought

15
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:43,300
I killed them all. The scary bug is up in my home. What I want to do is hit the bug with

16
00:00:43,300 --> 00:00:54,300
shoes. So yeah. We were talking about the misfits. I went to search that Glenn Danzig

17
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:58,300
cancel culture article and I just went to the search bar and I typed in Glenn Danzig

18
00:00:58,300 --> 00:01:03,980
You know how sometimes like when you search like a question like a little like like info thing will pop up as you're typing it like

19
00:01:03,980 --> 00:01:07,260
With an answer like you're typing an album name will be like say like something album name

20
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:12,860
I typed in Glenn Danzig space C to go to cancel culture and a little thing popped up that just said 5-3

21
00:01:25,780 --> 00:01:31,500
Yeah, it's so I mean he's a hundred percent. That's why he's so scared of but that's why he's so scared of spiders

22
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:39,960
Yeah, the itsy bitsy spider went up the the water spout I was I was actually already there

23
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:46,420
He's coming in my spout you see bitsy spider went up the bloody spout

24
00:01:50,420 --> 00:01:55,720
He's a hundred percent correct. You really couldn't make those songs nowadays. Absolutely not

25
00:01:55,720 --> 00:02:01,180
No, you like my mommy. Can I go out and kill tonight? No, you couldn't do that today. I

26
00:02:01,180 --> 00:02:07,580
Mean that like in like now I'm not being like facetious like you. Yeah, no, like some yeah

27
00:02:07,580 --> 00:02:14,080
No, you really could last caress or you like no no way. No way. I think bullet is that is the problem the

28
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:21,880
Amazing fucking songs a great song you could make that kind of shit. I mean, I don't like I don't like Jerry only misfits

29
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:26,620
I like listen to any misfits past Danzig. I don't care. Yeah

30
00:02:26,620 --> 00:02:31,040
Danzig's the fucking man, but Danzig with the misfits amazing

31
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:36,480
You can make that shit, but you you would just only make like $17 on Spotify every year, right?

32
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:41,460
Yeah, and like people who are like us would listen to it and be like, oh, they're so dope

33
00:02:41,460 --> 00:02:45,420
and then they would like stop making music in like two years and like well

34
00:02:45,420 --> 00:02:49,260
no look at salesman what would happen is they would write last caress and they

35
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:52,660
would like play it on a late-night show or something like get some kind of

36
00:02:52,660 --> 00:02:56,220
publicity I'm gonna be like okay this is fucked up you can't sing this and then

37
00:02:56,220 --> 00:03:00,260
suddenly a bunch of like like 70 year old conservatives would have to pretend

38
00:03:00,260 --> 00:03:06,460
that they love like mummies and and frankly exactly but like I'm going the

39
00:03:06,460 --> 00:03:26,280
the

40
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:30,720
the fucking march on Washington is one of the funniest fucking things that happened this

41
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:31,720
year.

42
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:33,880
It's one of the funniest ways to like end your career.

43
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:35,040
Oh for sure.

44
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:39,400
To go like, oh I'm gonna hang, I'm gonna go on Uncle's Day Out, I'm gonna go hang out

45
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:42,840
with them and ruin my career.

46
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:49,240
And it's funny because like, I don't know, like I am/was, I'm not gonna, hey I'm not

47
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:52,960
gonna touch that, a big R.L. Pink fan.

48
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:56,080
And it's funny, like he was just like constantly talking about like, yeah I don't know what

49
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:59,280
I'm going to do in like two years like in 2014.

50
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:01,080
He was just like, yeah, I don't know what I'm going to do.

51
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:03,280
People aren't going to like keep listening to my music.

52
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:09,680
So he was just like constantly like doomering himself until like he just found himself like calling Grimes the r-word

53
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:14,480
and like hanging out with with people who are storming the Capitol.

54
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:19,880
Right? It's a I mean do you what's there's some fucking interview that he did.

55
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:23,480
Oh, that's the thing. He's just he was such like an egotistical.

56
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:27,720
person, Ariel Pink. Like there's some interview I watched where he's like, "Well, you know,

57
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:32,360
I'm a genius." And like the woman interviewing him just starts laughing. And then he tries to

58
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:37,000
like pull out some R. Stevie Moore quote where he's like, "Well, a genius is just a fool with

59
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:42,680
a pocket." And it's just like, "Fuckin', you pretentious little fuck. God damn it."

60
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:48,280
And that didn't make me, that did not make me stop listening to his music when I was like 14.

61
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:53,000
I thought it was like, I was like, "Oh, I guess he's just trying to be funny and it didn't land."

62
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:57,720
Yeah, he was doing the thing where he was sort of like one foot in one foot out where it's

63
00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:02,680
like, I'm being funny. And it's like, Oh, I actually just sort of embarrassed myself in

64
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:06,920
front of this woman. Right? Yeah, that's sort of his was his bag a little bit.

65
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:11,800
Just to pull it back to Danzig for a second, I found the interview where he said the cancel

66
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:15,480
culture thing. It's like a Rolling Stone interview. It's about it's about his new

67
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:20,920
movie that's coming out, which is called I bet this title is great. Death Death Rider

68
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:27,720
in the house of vampires yes no it's a vampire western how can anyone be

69
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:34,180
fucking mad at this guy but listen to this what makes a good vampire movie and

70
00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:38,880
here's what is his response Wow what makes a good vampire movie you got to

71
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:45,160
have vampires everybody except the people who get bit in Death Rider are vampires

72
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:48,640
all the main cast are vampires so you don't have to wait around to see a

73
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:55,640
a vampire and you need a lot of blood. I love him so much. He's a fucking man. He's 5'3"

74
00:05:55,640 --> 00:06:02,880
because he's 4 1/2. He turns on Dracula and he's like, "Damn, I have to wait 10 minutes

75
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:09,560
until I see a vampire." I'm watching this movie and it's about vampires and I'm still

76
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:14,460
waiting for a vampire. This is taking way too long. I need to make a movie with vampires

77
00:06:14,460 --> 00:06:20,500
Everywhere that's like that is such a genius mind to be like yeah, it's a vampire movie. So everybody's a vampire. Yeah

78
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:22,500
It's all you're supposed to do

79
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:25,620
So cool

80
00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:32,780
Goddamn dude, it's so funny to like how how old is he now? He's probably like late 65. Yes 65 and he's like, oh

81
00:06:32,780 --> 00:06:40,100
Man, just like all those like doing those songs at 65 just more power to him. I love him so much

82
00:06:40,340 --> 00:06:43,860
Well, you've got to have some violence and shooting and people getting shot

83
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:47,860
So we have all that with close-ups grimacing at each other in Death Rider

84
00:06:47,860 --> 00:06:51,680
Look, I want movies to be fun, and I want people to be entertained by them

85
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:56,560
Dude he's the best he's the fucking best

86
00:06:56,560 --> 00:07:00,080
Anything anything

87
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:06,400
Stupid he says is like canceled out completely by mother that is one of the greatest songs in the world

88
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:12,000
It is a great track. That is one of the best songs. His Wikipedia has

89
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:16,220
Danzig and then Danzig continued as two separate sections

90
00:07:16,220 --> 00:07:23,160
That's just how much there is about him. Yeah, he's just done a lot of stuff

91
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:26,360
He did the original, wait, he did the soundtrack

92
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:30,540
Or just a song in the less than zero

93
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:35,960
Movie, which I don't know if you guys know that movie. No, I'm not not familiar where I'm too old

94
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:39,160
No, it's from 1987. It's like based on a

95
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:45,400
Bredi Sanellas book who's another another rock and roll guy man, Bredi Sanellas

96
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:48,060
Did you ever read his like takedown of the Teletubbies?

97
00:07:48,060 --> 00:07:55,920
Yeah, he like he like like was a there's a period of time where I don't know if he still blogs a lot

98
00:07:55,920 --> 00:08:00,720
But he was like he probably does but he was like a big like I'm a I'm a blogger

99
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:07,960
and I'm an old writer and he has this like like this diatribe he wrote against

100
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:11,920
the Teletubbies which some of it is like kind of I don't want to say salient

101
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:16,120
about this but it is and that like he taught like kind of like how vacuous

102
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:20,800
that kind of children's entertainment is but it's like it's so like goddamn like

103
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:27,080
try hard like blog trying to make yeah yeah I know you mean okay just the just

104
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:33,100
the sentence Brett Easton Ellis take down of the Teletubbies I think exactly what I need

105
00:08:33,100 --> 00:08:34,100
in my head.

106
00:08:34,100 --> 00:08:38,000
Yeah I'm gonna I don't need to read that I just know what it is already.

107
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,840
Oh yeah you don't need to.

108
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:45,780
Dude listen I'm just looking I'm just scrolling through Glenn Danzig interviews now.

109
00:08:45,780 --> 00:08:49,920
Did the comic book idea of becoming a different character someone larger than life feed into

110
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:52,700
the creation of Glenn Danzig the performer?

111
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:54,800
No I think you're reading too much into that.

112
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:56,800
The person you see on stage is me.

113
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:58,800
[Laughter]

114
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:00,800
They're like, they're like

115
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:02,800
loving in this softball to be like this cool

116
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:04,800
guy with the horror persona. He's like, "No, I'm

117
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:06,800
just, I'm just a guy."

118
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:08,800
I just like skeletons, man.

119
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:10,800
Yeah!

120
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,800
Yeah, it's, it's like...

121
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:14,800
[Laughter]

122
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:16,800
What do you remember of your first time performing on

123
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:18,800
a stage? I remember that people were

124
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:20,800
shocked that this little kid had this big, deep

125
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:22,800
voice.

126
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:27,440
No, I went up on stage, I showed everybody that I was really tough.

127
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:29,160
I was real tough and big.

128
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:30,800
Everybody was very surprised.

129
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:33,920
He's just had that voice his entire life, since he was like three years old.

130
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:37,320
He's been like, "Whoa!"

131
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:42,760
He saw like a spider or something in the garage, and his mom heard him.

132
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:48,160
He saw a spider and was just like, "Whoa!"

133
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:51,320
His mom was like, "Oh my god, Glenn?

134
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:54,320
Glenn are you s- oh my god!

135
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:56,320
Wait is his last name really Danzig?

136
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:56,820
Yeah.

137
00:09:56,820 --> 00:09:57,320
That's-

138
00:09:57,320 --> 00:10:00,320
Which- he was like born to be just a fucking-

139
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:01,320
Exactly, you're primed.

140
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:08,320
You get born named Glenn Danzig, you're either gonna end up as Glenn Danzig or you're gonna do some horrible global atrocity.

141
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:10,320
Those are the two options with that name.

142
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:14,320
I hate to say that, his name is Glenn Allen Anzalone.

143
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:15,320
What is it?

144
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:17,320
Glenn Allen Anzalone.

145
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:18,320
Anzalone.

146
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:19,320
Oh wow.

147
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:22,960
Wow. Yeah, better known by his stage name, Glenn Danzig.

148
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:24,760
Man, he's looking good, too.

149
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:27,840
He looks good. He looks like sort of a,

150
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:31,680
a, like a homunculus, you know?

151
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:33,640
He just sort of looks like he's made of clay.

152
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:35,280
I mean, he just, he's like,

153
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:37,080
he's held together by dark magic.

154
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:38,880
He looks like a, he looks like a fucking,

155
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:41,680
like satanic doppelganger of Steven Seagal.

156
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:43,120
Yeah. Like, he's like,

157
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:45,320
the same type of like falling apart old guy.

158
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:48,000
He looks like, yeah, like he looks slightly off version

159
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,480
of Steven Seagal like a slightly different yeah, it's like an

160
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:53,520
unsettling like you see him next to Steven Seagal, you get a

161
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:54,560
chill up your spine.

162
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:56,080
It's like Steven Seagal and him.

163
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:57,360
Steven Seagal's mini me.

164
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:05,880
A mini me of Seagal just like Cajun Seagal too. He's just like

165
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:06,440

00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:18,760
Let me tell you, let me tell you man.

169
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:21,620
I was too small, I got kicked.

I got kicked straight into the swamp.

171
00:11:24,020 --> 00:11:26,360
And I had to ride an alligator to get home.

172
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:29,440
I had to ride a frog.

173
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:38,800
Hey, Glenn Danzig is if you like went back, if you like had Steven Seagal and you went back in time and you replaced like

174
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:42,040
the mobile above his crib with just like a spider on a thread.

175
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:45,160
Like that's, it's just like one point in history that changes them.

176
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:51,260
Just like different trajectories glad dancing like crying in his crib like he sees a spider like a baby like

177
00:11:51,260 --> 00:11:57,280
Looking dead at you

178
00:11:57,280 --> 00:11:59,920
Yelling

179
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:04,160
Like the devil lock hair that he had in the 70s

00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:20,320
fucking like rig rundowns of

183
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:22,240
guitars and shit

184
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:25,480
There's this Jerry only one where it's like him

185
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:31,480
it's like it Jerry only still doing like the misfits in like 2000 and 14 something like that and

186
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:37,340
It's like with I think it's with ultimate guitar magazine, but he's holding like you know the

187
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:42,640
Like when a news reporter has like a microphone they have like the little box. Oh, yeah. Yeah

By the fucking box and being like yeah, my guitars made entirely out of graphite

Think like to be like a like rocker

00:13:14,740 --> 00:13:20,880
During that time you just you needed to be like the most confident person in your area code

196
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:25,320
And that's the way go hard and so like it's it just sounds like

Like he he has like seven brain cells, but like he'll hold the mic like that and he'll like be like yeah

198
00:13:32,020 --> 00:13:37,020
That's how you hold it. Like that's how yeah, it's like this is the way like obviously it's in my hand. Yeah

199
00:13:37,020 --> 00:13:44,880

00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:55,900
yeah it was 20 years past when that was scary yeah it's like it's very cool to

214
00:14:55,900 --> 00:15:03,100
just to like just be like not not really ever like it's like if we if we like

215
00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:07,540
formed a band right now and was like oh yeah this is Saw themed like we're the

216
00:15:07,540 --> 00:15:11,740
cutting-edge like Saw themed band. We've talked about this at length definitely

217
00:15:11,740 --> 00:15:16,940
just like the fucking like Slipknot now is like Misfits for us like

218
00:15:16,940 --> 00:15:23,640
our generation yeah yeah and it's like a hundred percent like true you couldn't

219
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:28,060
you couldn't fucking do you like totally could not do what the Misfits did now no

220
00:15:28,060 --> 00:15:29,060
No, not in the, yeah.

221
00:15:29,060 --> 00:15:34,900
Well, Slipknot at least, like, I feel like that was more, that's like still like scary,

222
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:39,060
like their theme was, is like, didn't like.

223
00:15:39,060 --> 00:15:40,060
The thing about, yeah, the thing about Slipknot is that.

224
00:15:40,060 --> 00:15:42,380
It doesn't have the monster mash, you know, like it's not.

225
00:15:42,380 --> 00:15:47,460
Yeah, they were, they were, their theme was, was like contemporary when they did it.

226
00:15:47,460 --> 00:15:48,460
Yes, yeah.

227
00:15:48,460 --> 00:15:53,820
It's like, it's like, it would be like if Slipknot was like.

228
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:54,820
Was like 80s.

229
00:15:54,820 --> 00:15:56,540
Yeah, is they doing 80s horror.

230
00:15:56,540 --> 00:16:02,460
It had to be no because you know what it's it even comparable because like you you still you see Mike Myers

231
00:16:02,460 --> 00:16:09,700
You're still freaked out if you see like Frankenstein or Frankenstein's monster or whatever. You're just like oh that guy's hilarious

232
00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:12,900
Like that's that's a big idiot. Maybe you are

233
00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:18,660
That's why I can't get into the misfits like I'm not properly like oh, haha

234
00:16:18,660 --> 00:16:22,880
Oh, I definitely we have that we've definitely talked about so much before and probably on the podcast too

235
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:27,800
But the thing about the misfits is that it's like it's 50% or it's like maybe like like 70%

236
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:33,920
Frankenstein stuff and then it like the rest of it is just like I am going to sexually assault your child

237
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:40,240
Yeah, it's like just yeah, that's a huge like I made it like once every few songs. They just wrote something

238
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:46,960
It was like, okay, come on guys that yeah, I mean I made a joke earlier today where I was like, yeah, you can't make

239
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:51,080
teenagers from mars nowadays just being like the extent of the like the course

240
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:51,760
is just a

241
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:53,800
district are the way out there

242
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:57,280
and like the first line in that fucking song is

243
00:16:57,280 --> 00:17:00,880
we landed there in fields on the arizona plays the examination of little girls in

244
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:04,160
the middle of wet dreams it's like oh yeah i think i think that it make that

245
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:06,120
now it is

246
00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:10,120
i really couldn't fucking make that's not what i forgot he was in you know what

247
00:17:10,120 --> 00:17:14,840
the danzig was in aqua teen and he was in that episode of portlandia

248
00:17:14,840 --> 00:17:17,080
oh yeah he's so funny on that episode

249
00:17:17,080 --> 00:17:18,960
so he he

250
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:22,240
yeah i think he's yeah he's just sort of on his own wave like

251
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:26,040
it's like yeah he just has his own thing it's so great

252
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:30,120
'cause it's like he knows what he's he like knows what he is and he doesn't at

253
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:31,440
the same time

254
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:34,540
it's like one of those things where it's like a guy who like thinks

255
00:17:34,540 --> 00:17:37,520
like is like oh yeah i don't take myself seriously and is like

256
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:39,320
oh i don't think you do

257
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:41,640
but i also think you you don't

258
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:42,560
almost

259
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:45,000
don't completely know why you're funny.

260
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,900
Have you seen that video of him?

261
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:50,240
It's like him and his bookshelf.

262
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:54,200
It's so fucking good. It's just him just like

263
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:57,440
yeah this is a book about werewolves.

264
00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:00,560
You showed me that. Yeah, oh I totally have.

265
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:03,800
The best part of guys like Danzig

266
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:08,280
is when they forge their own path and they make this insane mix of stuff

267
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:09,040
that just like

268
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:14,240
should not work is like so ridiculous is that then like all the people who are fans of him like are

269
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:19,440
like oh i'm gonna do this too and then it becomes like a thing even though it's just like like right

270
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:23,920
like it's like i'm like if you look at you scroll through like the past i'm looking at past members

271
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:29,360
of the misfits right now and it's people named like dr chud and mike hideous and it's like what

272
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:33,600
would these people be doing with their lives if dancing didn't exist because i know that they did

273
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:37,280
not come up with calling themselves Dr. Chud on their phone.

274
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:43,320
It is so crazy, like people like, yeah, it's like somebody just has like a singular vision

275
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:48,760
for an artistic project, I guess is a way to put it. And then like, because it just

276
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:52,600
happened to work, everyone, like there's like a satellite community.

277
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:53,840
Oh yeah, of course, yeah.

278
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:59,000
Yeah, of course, of course, yeah. I'm bloody tits, like I love this band.

279
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,800
Here's another past, Arthur Googie?

280
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:02,800
Arthur G-O-O-G-Y.

281
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:06,800
Mr. Jim is another one.

282
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:13,560
A.C. Slade, Dave Lombardo, oh that's just a guy's name.

283
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:16,880
Dave Lombardo was this freak.

284
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:17,880
Yeah.

285
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:22,800
A.C. Slade, born Emil John Schmidt IV.

286
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:24,480
That's a much better name.

287
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:28,480
The scariest thing to me would be to be a guy.

288
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:32,080
a guy named Dave that would just fucking freak me the fuck out.

289
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:35,480
The Chupacabra was in their band.

290
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:42,920
Going by Mr. Jim is so funny like being with guys named Robo and Dr. Chug and Chupacabra

291
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:46,400
and be like yeah I'm Mr. Jim.

292
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:48,840
Oh yo Dave Lombardo is like legit.

293
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:51,800
Yeah he's at so much stuff now.

294
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:53,000
Oh shit he was in Mr. Bungle too.

295
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:57,280
He does a bunch of stuff with Mike Patton he's the current guitarist for uh.

296
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:59,280
Oh, I had no idea he was in Slayer.

297
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:01,280
He's a guitarist too.

298
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:03,280
That's why I was making fun of you.

299
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:05,280
That makes sense.

300
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:07,280
He was in Phantom Mass too.

301
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:09,280
Damn.

302
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:11,280
Oh yeah, with Patton.

303
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:13,280
Cool.

304
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:15,280
Yeah, I knew that.

305
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:17,280
It's just a funny thing.

306
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:19,280
Funny thing to know and pretend you don't know.

307
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:21,280
But I just did that.

308
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:25,280
You ever think about how many times you've done that?

309
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:27,080
where you just go, "Yeah!"

310
00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:28,300
And then you're like, "Oh, fuck."

311
00:20:28,300 --> 00:20:30,560
- Oh, yeah, I do it all the time, just 'cause like,

312
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:33,040
I mean, being on this show,

313
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:34,800
that's the blood type misreception.

314
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:35,760
- You have to. - It is.

315
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:38,240
- No, especially, dude, I have to do that so much,

316
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:40,760
'cause you and Caleb watched all the same TV shows

317
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:42,640
growing up, but I did not watch a single one of them,

318
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:45,440
so I just have to be like, "Yeah, man, totally!"

319
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:48,360
- Yeah, and then like, fucking, I don't know,

320
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:50,920
there's been times where it's like,

321
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:53,880
I'll just say something just to move the conversation along,

322
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:57,020
I'm just like, yeah, oh, I totally fucking know.

323
00:20:57,020 --> 00:21:01,820
Like, yeah, it is kind of crazy to like, I mean, I've only I've

324
00:21:01,820 --> 00:21:07,220
only been on the show proper a couple times but like to besides

325
00:21:07,220 --> 00:21:09,120
that, you know, not the D&D stuff the D&D stuff.

326
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:11,020
There's always something to talk about because we're right.

327
00:21:11,020 --> 00:21:13,720
We're talking about fucking goblins and yeah, yeah, right.

328
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:17,220
But but in like the the podcast, it's like, yeah, you have to

329
00:21:17,220 --> 00:21:20,020
like fucking find the next thought.

330
00:21:20,020 --> 00:21:23,420
Yeah, like because you can't yeah, you can't be like, I don't

331
00:21:23,420 --> 00:21:25,420
know what you guys are talking about.

332
00:21:25,420 --> 00:21:26,420
Right.

333
00:21:26,420 --> 00:21:27,420
We do that all the time.

334
00:21:27,420 --> 00:21:28,420
Which I mean that would be pretty funny.

335
00:21:28,420 --> 00:21:32,220
Yeah, well that's the thing, it's like yeah, it's a push and pull.

336
00:21:32,220 --> 00:21:36,020
I don't think there's anything better to listen to than people talking about podcasting while

337
00:21:36,020 --> 00:21:37,020
podcasting.

338
00:21:37,020 --> 00:21:38,020
Oh for sure.

339
00:21:38,020 --> 00:21:39,020
Yeah.

340
00:21:39,020 --> 00:21:41,660
This is a little, you know, if you guys want to start up your own podcast you can use this

341
00:21:41,660 --> 00:21:42,660
for it.

342
00:21:42,660 --> 00:21:45,340
We're doing like, right now we're doing like a Gary Shanling thing.

343
00:21:45,340 --> 00:21:46,340
We're doing like a...

344
00:21:46,340 --> 00:21:49,940
Well really what's happening is that we've been...

345
00:21:49,940 --> 00:21:52,980
I know who Gary Shanling is.

346
00:21:52,980 --> 00:21:58,380
I never watched him or cared about him at all in any way, but my friend's mom likes him.

347
00:21:58,380 --> 00:22:05,300
I haven't put a dent in it yet, but I have his autobiography, the Judd Apatow one over

348
00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:06,300
here.

349
00:22:06,300 --> 00:22:09,980
You have every TV person's autobiography on your bookshelf.

350
00:22:09,980 --> 00:22:14,060
I have the Judd Apatow, what was that one that's called where it's all his interviews

351
00:22:14,060 --> 00:22:15,060
he did?

352
00:22:15,060 --> 00:22:16,060
With Shanling?

353
00:22:16,060 --> 00:22:18,100
I don't know if it's with Shanling.

354
00:22:18,100 --> 00:22:20,140
Oh, that's the one where he just interviewed Shanling.

355
00:22:20,140 --> 00:22:21,140
Yeah.

356
00:22:21,140 --> 00:22:22,140
Oh no, I don't have that one.

357
00:22:22,140 --> 00:22:23,140
school.

358
00:22:23,140 --> 00:22:26,820
Did you guys see Gary Shanling's book or something like that?

359
00:22:26,820 --> 00:22:29,420
Did you guys see what the epitaph said about Parasite?

360
00:22:29,420 --> 00:22:30,420
No.

361
00:22:30,420 --> 00:22:34,540
He said that he hated Parasite because it wasn't funny.

362
00:22:34,540 --> 00:22:40,780
Which is, that's not, Parasite was very funny.

363
00:22:40,780 --> 00:22:48,540
I think about the shot where the father is just like planking on the ground while the

364
00:22:48,540 --> 00:22:50,540
husband is fingering the wife.

365
00:22:50,540 --> 00:22:51,540
Yeah.

366
00:22:51,540 --> 00:22:54,780
And he's just like planking on the ground and I like cracked up in the theater.

367
00:22:54,780 --> 00:22:56,180
And yeah, he's just incorrect about it.

368
00:22:56,180 --> 00:22:58,780
If that movie was anything, it was funny.

369
00:22:58,780 --> 00:22:59,780
Right.

370
00:22:59,780 --> 00:23:04,900
Yeah, like, like I mean, I don't, I, you could talk about whatever you want about how successful

371
00:23:04,900 --> 00:23:08,140
it is at everything else it's trying to do, but it was very funny.

372
00:23:08,140 --> 00:23:09,140
Yeah.

373
00:23:09,140 --> 00:23:11,660
I'm trying to find that quote now.

374
00:23:11,660 --> 00:23:17,620
Well what was the, uh, the Ramadan thing was like a big joke for like Korean audiences.

375
00:23:17,620 --> 00:23:21,860
but like America just flew over every American's head because it's like

376
00:23:21,860 --> 00:23:26,860
I don't know oh she's like cook like that she makes like a what isn't it a

377
00:23:26,860 --> 00:23:29,940
what no it's not like a way to make an expensive cut of meat

378
00:23:29,940 --> 00:23:33,980
yeah like fucking like just ramen noodle like pre-packaged

379
00:23:33,980 --> 00:23:38,020
oh yeah yeah yeah yeah and everyone in America was like oh I need to try this

380
00:23:38,020 --> 00:23:41,380
and it's yeah right yeah yeah and okay yeah that

381
00:23:41,380 --> 00:23:45,900
yes yeah that flew over my head yeah that I mean yeah I didn't say it's a foreign

382
00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:46,500
movie

383
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:49,700
yeah yeah foreign movie of course like us fucking stupid

384
00:23:49,700 --> 00:23:51,380
americans are loyal

385
00:23:51,380 --> 00:23:52,460
lol

386
00:23:52,460 --> 00:23:53,860
this is some of the thing

387
00:23:53,860 --> 00:23:58,620
this is something amazing career-ish i've never had a right right now

388
00:23:58,620 --> 00:23:59,860
but i'm an american

389
00:23:59,860 --> 00:24:03,200
uh... movie was on all of all the poor family died

390
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:06,620
yet yet i think i asked you uh... okay

391
00:24:06,620 --> 00:24:08,780
why the uh...

392
00:24:08,780 --> 00:24:13,220
a lot of that those themes in that movie i can get behind but the appropriation of

393
00:24:13,220 --> 00:24:18,820
Native American culture is not something I can really do.

394
00:24:18,820 --> 00:24:24,420
I only watched that movie in the context of just seeing a Native American appropriation

395
00:24:24,420 --> 00:24:25,420
moment.

396
00:24:25,420 --> 00:24:28,260
I didn't really watch the rest of it, but that was enough.

397
00:24:28,260 --> 00:24:31,060
I watched it without subtitles and I was confused.

398
00:24:31,060 --> 00:24:33,980
The subtitles distract me.

399
00:24:33,980 --> 00:24:39,940
I didn't want to read!

400
00:24:39,940 --> 00:24:44,260
a movie and just like without subtitles and it's like a Korean movie it just be

401
00:24:44,260 --> 00:24:51,420
like I think this is racist. Going to see Parasite in the theater and going up to

402
00:24:51,420 --> 00:24:54,500
the screen and trying to tape over the part of the screen where the subtitles

403
00:24:54,500 --> 00:25:09,240
are but just get projected on. You do that and nobody stops you. You sit down after and you see it doesn't work

404
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:12,040
Like, oh, here we go.

405
00:25:12,040 --> 00:25:13,080
Didn't work again.

406
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:17,280
Oh, man. Yeah, I think what was the last movie?

407
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:19,980
I don't know if you guys talked about this already on an episode.

408
00:25:19,980 --> 00:25:21,340
Oh, last movie we saw in theater.

409
00:25:21,340 --> 00:25:24,940
Yeah, I was going to say you probably did, but mine is Invisible Man.

410
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:26,340
Yeah, Invisible Man for me, too.

411
00:25:26,340 --> 00:25:27,580
But I walked out of him.

412
00:25:27,580 --> 00:25:28,880
You walked out of it.

413
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:30,780
Yeah. You not like it?

414
00:25:30,780 --> 00:25:33,480
It's too scary. No, it wasn't.

415
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:34,980
OK. Yeah.

416
00:25:34,980 --> 00:25:36,640

Yeah, I had I saw the Sonic movie.

418

Oh, I wish that's a lot of people's movie.

I think you got it.

423
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:58,540
I think you got a bad rap because it was bad, but you know,

424
00:25:58,540 --> 00:26:00,240
I think it was fun.

425

427
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:11,120
Yeah, there's a lot of movies like that where it's just like I'll never watch them on their own because it's like

428
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:16,040
You know a fucking kids movie, but I watch Teen Titans go to the movies with my nephews

Sure.

490
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:03,720
Yeah.

491
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:04,720
Yeah.

492
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:06,960
God, it was a fun game.

493
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:13,840
I did that whole baptism with my fingers crossed behind my back because I thought we were joking.

494
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:14,840
Yeah.

495
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:15,840
Oh, man.

496
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:17,760
I thought you were in the hospital because you were fat.

497
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:18,760
I'm sorry.

498
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:19,760
I thought you got lipo.

499
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:20,760
Yeah.

500
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:22,760
I thought you got lipo.

501
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:24,760
Yeah.

502
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:28,760
Yo, I just got lipo.

503
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:30,760
And then I thought the nephews came

504
00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:32,760
cause they saw you weren't fat anymore

505
00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:34,760
and they thought it was okay to come hang out.

506
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:36,760
I don't know, it doesn't make

507
00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:38,760
any sense when you say it out loud.

508
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:40,760
I'm starting to cry.

509
00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:42,760
I'm not

510
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:44,760
saying nephews are fat phobic

511
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:46,760
but it's just like, why else?

512
00:29:46,760 --> 00:29:48,760
Why else?

513
00:29:48,760 --> 00:29:52,760
But yeah, anyway, Lego Batman tomorrow.

514
00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:56,760
Four hours from now.

515
00:29:56,760 --> 00:30:00,760
Speaking of, my mom

516
00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:04,760
would put on Hong Kong Phuoi for my nephews.

517
00:30:04,760 --> 00:30:08,760
And older shows, like the Super Friends and stuff, like cartoons from when she was younger.

518
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:12,760
Do your parents ever do that to you? When you were younger, put on

519
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:16,760
an older show, and then you watched a shit ton of it, and now it's a part of

520
00:30:16,760 --> 00:30:22,520
your childhood but it's like an old show so you don't have like this is a weird

521
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:27,860
yeah it's a weird thing for me for sure cuz like I grew up watching like Muppets

522
00:30:27,860 --> 00:30:33,740
babies VHS tapes and shit so now like my childhood is like Muppet babies so I can

523
00:30:33,740 --> 00:30:39,060
I can talk to somebody who's like like born like 1980 whatever it's like oh do

524
00:30:39,060 --> 00:30:42,980
you remember this it's like how that I don't fucking I don't remember it yeah

525
00:30:42,980 --> 00:30:44,980
I just experienced it.

526
00:30:44,980 --> 00:30:49,980
Yeah, I also experienced it, but then I'll say like, "Oh, remember Muppet Babies?"

527
00:30:49,980 --> 00:30:53,980
It's like, no, nobody my age fucking remembers Muppet Babies.

528
00:30:53,980 --> 00:30:55,980
I'm trying to think if I have that with anything.

529
00:30:55,980 --> 00:30:59,980
I didn't watch very much TV as a kid. It was mostly movies for me.

530
00:30:59,980 --> 00:31:02,980
It was Godzilla movies, that was my older thing.

531
00:31:02,980 --> 00:31:06,980
Yeah, that for like Star Wars and fucking Muppet Babies.

532
00:31:06,980 --> 00:31:10,980
Muppet Babies because I watched the Muppet... I had a Muppet Babies VHS tape

533
00:31:10,980 --> 00:31:15,980
because it had the Star Wars themed episode.

534
00:31:15,980 --> 00:31:17,280
- Yo. - Yo.

535
00:31:17,280 --> 00:31:18,700
- So I would watch that one.

536
00:31:18,700 --> 00:31:20,440
And then fucking, I went to this,

537
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:23,040
I think I told, I don't think I talked about this

538
00:31:23,040 --> 00:31:24,680
on the podcast, but I had the worst po-boy

539
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:25,920
I've ever had in my life.

540
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:28,500
(laughing)

541
00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:30,200
It was like, it should have been--

542
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:31,240
- When you were a kid?

543
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:32,640
- No, like a week ago.

544
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:34,120
Two weeks, two, three weeks ago.

545
00:31:34,120 --> 00:31:35,600
- Hold on, it's coming back around.

546
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:38,280
You gotta understand the temporal complexity of the story.

547
00:31:38,280 --> 00:31:39,640
- Look, I got ADHD.

548
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:45,240
if you're going to criticize how i tell story on a non-alcoholic it's true we

549
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:48,640
went over this on to get the other day a ariya

550
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:56,200
yeah now i can pull that card out that the adhd discourse yeah thank god but

551
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:59,240
see but i have it so you don't hear me being annoying about it don't have any

552
00:31:59,240 --> 00:32:02,240
idea i do much more powerful

553
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:08,800
here's something much more useful but like two three weeks ago i just had like

554
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:13,880
a really bad po'boy and the place that I got it from was playing that episode of Muppet

555
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:16,480
Babies on the screen for some reason.

556
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:18,560
And it was like a huge, it was like a bar.

557
00:32:18,560 --> 00:32:20,280
It was like a really big fucking restaurant.

558
00:32:20,280 --> 00:32:22,800
This is like a European film about your life.

559
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:27,040
It's like, I got a shitty sandwich.

560
00:32:27,040 --> 00:32:29,800
I saw a memory from childhood on the TV.

561
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:34,040
It was the best moment and the worst moment, same time.

562
00:32:34,040 --> 00:32:40,720
What's happened to me with remembering media, over the past year or two, I've been just watching

563
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:45,520
an insane amount of movies, way more than I ever have in my life, one a day or more

564
00:32:45,520 --> 00:32:46,520
usually.

565
00:32:46,520 --> 00:32:48,760
And so a lot of them I just don't retain.

566
00:32:48,760 --> 00:32:53,840
And so sometimes I'll just be sitting around and just an image from a movie will pop into

567
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:57,280
my head that I watched in the past two years that I don't remember, and I have no way to

568
00:32:57,280 --> 00:32:58,280
figure it out.

569
00:32:58,280 --> 00:33:02,040
It'll just be like, I'll just be sitting there and I'll just be like, "Oh, a man crying."

570
00:33:02,040 --> 00:33:05,880
I'm trying to figure out like yeah

571
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:16,160
I have that and I forget it. Oh my god. There was one. I finally cemented it in my head. There's a line that

572
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:21,920
Carla from scrubs says where she calls I think JD

573
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:24,800
patronizing ass and

574
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:31,280
for some reason that like like stuck in my head for when I was like 14 and watching scrubs and

575
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:35,200
And I would remember and then look up the line, not find it.

576
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:37,200
Remember, look at the line, find it, forget it.

577
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:41,040
And then like the 10th time I did it, I was just like, I'm committing this to memory.

578
00:33:41,040 --> 00:33:41,520
Yeah.

579
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:43,600
They need to, they need to stop developing.

580
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:48,160
They need to stop developing like, like fucking like face recognition, surveillance stuff and

581
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:52,640
just cat, just catalog every single TV show and movie ever so I can just Google a phrase.

582
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:52,880
Right.

583
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:54,480
And yeah.

584
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:57,280
And just, uh, what were you doing there?

585
00:33:57,280 --> 00:33:57,840
What was that?

586
00:33:57,840 --> 00:34:00,240
Cause I'm uh, the sunlight, the sunlight.

587
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:10,360
like scary yeah sorry but uh you ever you ever find him by accident not like like

588
00:34:10,360 --> 00:34:13,260
the things that you remember like that and then like out of nowhere you're like

589
00:34:13,260 --> 00:34:17,280
oh fuck that's the fucking that's the thing yes that's the thing of course that

590
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:22,080
happened uh I saw an episode of the Twilight Zone that was shot on like a

591
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:27,920
different camera than like they usually shot mm-hmm and I thought like for some

592
00:34:27,920 --> 00:34:32,000
reason the TV that I was watching it on it made it look like it was like shot

593
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:37,760
like like from CCTV footage or something like that like in my head it was like

594
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:43,560
this is a very weird looking episode yeah and I remember like being terrified

595
00:34:43,560 --> 00:34:48,560
of it as a kid because I was like that that looks like it like until the

596
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:51,920
fucking plane crash it's about like a plane crash and some woman is like in a

597
00:34:51,920 --> 00:34:54,840
morgue or something like she goes down to the morgue in the hospital she keeps having a

598
00:34:54,840 --> 00:34:58,920
Oh, I've seen that one. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I know that one. I know that I know that episode

599
00:34:58,920 --> 00:35:04,080
So I saw that one and I know that one what the fuck is that that was shot

600
00:35:04,080 --> 00:35:10,400
So fucking weird that looks like it wasn't that looks like somebody was like I thought somebody was like broadcasting it

601
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:14,120
To like a TV station it I don't know

602
00:35:14,120 --> 00:35:20,640
I thought I like had uncovered some fucking lost media thing or whatever and then I showed my I found it and then showed my

603
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:23,760
parents and I was like does this look weird and my dad is like no that's just

604
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:28,400
like what the soap opera cameras look like in the sea yeah right it's like oh

605
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:34,320
okay I that I remember that episode because I remember that the woman acting

606
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:39,920
in it was like just overacting yeah yeah yeah like even for Twilight Zone like

607
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:44,320
she was really good ham and that one I thought that somebody like had done a

608
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:48,080
shot-for-shot remake of an episode or something and they were like playing it

609
00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:57,200
on TV. And I was like, this is fucked up. I think that like, it's it's so unfortunate

610
00:35:57,200 --> 00:36:03,080
that like, we've consumed so much shit that like now like all media ends up becoming some

611
00:36:03,080 --> 00:36:09,000
sort of like soupy memory bucket that we just like, can't can't really appreciate it until

612
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:14,360
like it's actively triggered. Like, yeah, yeah, like I just want Yeah, for some reason,

613
00:36:14,360 --> 00:36:17,400
you just remind me Patrick of one thing that was stuck in my head those from like a Reddit

614
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:21,760
post that was like I read in like since I was on Reddit I must have read it in

615
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:24,420
either middle school or high school because I haven't touched Reddit in that

616
00:36:24,420 --> 00:36:27,280
long I don't know like I can't I haven't tried to find it since I can't find it

617
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:30,120
it was like a comment on some ask Reddit thread and I think it was unrelated to

618
00:36:30,120 --> 00:36:32,840
whatever the question was and it was just this long paragraph that someone

619
00:36:32,840 --> 00:36:37,120
typed out it was like when I was a kid this guy and it was like a link to a

620
00:36:37,120 --> 00:36:41,400
picture and it was like a like a puppet bear that looked kind of like the

621
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:44,740
sleepytime bear like it had like a yellow nightcap type thing but it wasn't

622
00:36:44,740 --> 00:36:46,580
and I haven't been able to find out what the bear is.

623
00:36:46,580 --> 00:36:47,420
I can't find a picture of it

624
00:36:47,420 --> 00:36:48,860
'cause I can't like search for it.

625
00:36:48,860 --> 00:36:51,980
- Yeah, it's probably some like Russian fucking thing.

626
00:36:51,980 --> 00:36:54,580
- It's yeah, some like weird, like fucking old show thing.

627
00:36:54,580 --> 00:36:56,220
And it was like this, when I was a kid,

628
00:36:56,220 --> 00:36:58,780
this bear used to crawl into my bedroom on the ceiling

629
00:36:58,780 --> 00:37:00,580
like a spider and look at me in the eye

630
00:37:00,580 --> 00:37:02,780
and tell me he was going to kill my family.

631
00:37:02,780 --> 00:37:05,640
(laughing)

632
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:08,780
It was like, I took a screenshot of it

633
00:37:08,780 --> 00:37:09,660
back when I first saw it,

634
00:37:09,660 --> 00:37:12,340
but it was on my old computer or something

635
00:37:12,340 --> 00:37:13,780
and it's lost forever.

636
00:37:13,780 --> 00:37:16,940
I can't find it on search. It's so tragic. I want it so badly.

637
00:37:16,940 --> 00:37:20,420
Yeah. Have you ever, have you ever been the person that like, uh,

638
00:37:20,420 --> 00:37:24,660
on memory hole something for somebody, you know what I mean by that?

639
00:37:24,660 --> 00:37:28,220
Like, I don't know. Yeah. Like they're like describing it.

640
00:37:28,220 --> 00:37:30,780
And then you're like, like, it's something that you know very well,

641
00:37:30,780 --> 00:37:33,940
but like they, you just like, you say it, you say it.

642
00:37:33,940 --> 00:37:36,180
And then like, you just see in their face, they're just like,

643
00:37:41,300 --> 00:37:44,900
Like when a character in an anime sees a sexy woman.

644
00:37:44,900 --> 00:37:45,400
Yeah.

645
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:46,400
Exact same reaction.

646
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:47,400
Like when Danzig sings.

647
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:53,000
This is gonna get me fucking called out as a tiaboo by Cameron, but like my ex's mom,

648
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,700
uh, I knew like what the Young Ones was.

649
00:37:55,700 --> 00:37:58,700
And I like reminded her that like the Young Ones existed.

650
00:37:58,700 --> 00:37:59,700
Yeah, I don't know.

651
00:37:59,700 --> 00:38:00,700
I don't know what that is.

652
00:38:00,700 --> 00:38:02,700
I don't know what it is well enough to make fun of you for it.

653
00:38:02,700 --> 00:38:03,200
Okay, good.

654
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:04,200
Alright, never mind then.

655
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:06,200
Well, I'll find out till we can.

656
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:08,700
If you knew what it was, you would-

657
00:38:08,700 --> 00:38:10,200
I'm sure, yeah.

658
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:14,760
I'm sure some fucking British listener is going to be like, "Why the fuck?"

659
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:17,320
It's not your fault you were born fucked up, dude.

660
00:38:17,320 --> 00:38:18,320
It's true.

661
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:19,320
It's not your fault.

662
00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:21,600
I'm getting, you know, I'm getting in touch with my heritage.

663
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:24,540
Oh man, what is this?

664
00:38:24,540 --> 00:38:27,280
It's a Rick Mayall show.

665
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:31,680
It's actually, it doesn't, it's pretty dated, but it's pretty funny.

666
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:32,680
Wow.

667
00:38:32,680 --> 00:38:37,400
It seems like it's a precursor to Inbetweeners or something.

668
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:38,400
Not really.

669
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:40,720
for its allies and it's pretty

670
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:43,360
history please surrealist

671
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:45,240
and sometimes it will

672
00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:51,040
really will be at the b_n_a_ parents from uh... a new wave and so it's ok so it's

673
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:52,640
a pretty good

674
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:54,440
yes you have a great

675
00:38:54,440 --> 00:38:59,760
the doctor who uh... monty python faulty towers the office

676
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:02,680
i_d_ crowd i_d_ crowd blue jam

677
00:39:02,680 --> 00:39:04,680
the day-to-day...

678
00:39:04,680 --> 00:39:06,680
Spongebob, British Spongebob.

679
00:39:06,680 --> 00:39:10,180
The cast in British Spongebob was really something else.

680
00:39:10,180 --> 00:39:10,680
I have to say.

681
00:39:10,680 --> 00:39:12,680
"Oh, a Squidward! Oh!"

682
00:39:12,680 --> 00:39:16,680
"Oh, leave me no part of that!"

683
00:39:16,680 --> 00:39:17,680
You know?

684
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:19,680
British Spongebob was live action too.

685
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:20,680
"Oh!"

686
00:39:20,680 --> 00:39:22,680
Yeah, just what a guy looks like over there.

687
00:39:22,680 --> 00:39:26,680
They didn't need you to make up on a British guy to make him look like Squidward.

688
00:39:26,680 --> 00:39:27,680
Yeah.

689
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:28,680
Or Spongebob.

690
00:39:28,680 --> 00:39:30,680
Patrick, they got an Irish guy.

691
00:39:30,680 --> 00:39:37,680
an Irish guy. Yeah, exactly. I live under a rock! That's what he said.

692
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:42,680
You know what's speaking to me? I've been listening to it a shit ton.

693
00:39:42,680 --> 00:39:48,680
SpongeBob theme song? No, no. That song "Over and Done With" by the Proclaimers.

694
00:39:48,680 --> 00:39:54,680
Don't know it. No. It's a great song. Great song.

695
00:39:54,680 --> 00:39:57,160
How does it go?

696
00:39:57,160 --> 00:39:59,200
It's the one where they're like, "It's over and done with!

697
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:00,200
It's over and done with!

698
00:40:00,200 --> 00:40:01,200
Over and done with!"

699
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:02,200
Yeah?

700
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:03,200
Alright.

701
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:04,200
"This is the story of losing my virginity!"

702
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:05,200
Oh, that's funny.

703
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:06,200
I like that.

704
00:40:06,200 --> 00:40:07,200
It's a great song.

705
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:08,200
I'm not gonna...

706
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:09,200
No.

707
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:10,200
I take back me thinking it's funny, because it's...

708
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:11,200
The proclaimers are very good.

709
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:12,200
Yeah.

710
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:13,200
Do you know the band Leatherface?

711
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:14,200
No.

712
00:40:14,200 --> 00:40:15,200
They're like a British punk rock band.

713
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:16,200
Yeah.

714
00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:17,200

Yeah.

718
00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:21,200
They're like a British punk rock band.

719
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:22,200

726
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:51,120
But then the songs well, this isn't a British band. This is an Irish band with the undertones

00:40:51,340 --> 00:40:54,000

Very cool.

773
00:43:45,600 --> 00:43:50,000
What's the fuck, the chorus of that song is just like, "Bush was right!"

774
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:54,040
I remember that one.

00:43:54,040 --> 00:43:55,040
That's good.

776
00:43:55,040 --> 00:43:56,040

Well you know what, because that's like, what was that, like a reaction to American Idiot?

778
00:43:59,040 --> 00:44:00,040
I guess.

779
00:44:00,040 --> 00:44:01,040
Yeah.

780
00:44:01,040 --> 00:44:05,280
So like, so it's all on the same like, you know, about two inches deep sort of playing

781
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:06,280
field.

782
00:44:06,280 --> 00:44:07,280
Look at their fucking album cover.

783
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:08,280
I'm sorry to interrupt you.

784
00:44:08,280 --> 00:44:09,280
No, no, fuck it.

785
00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:16,080
Oh my god, they look like like this is what conservative punks would look like. Let's see what this looks like

786
00:44:16,080 --> 00:44:23,880
Like conservative. Oh for affliction. Yeah affliction tease and the song is called I'm in love with Ann Coulter

787
00:44:23,880 --> 00:44:29,920
The name of the album is no apologies. Yeah. Oh my god, dude

788
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:36,480
It rules so hard just like like thinking like oh we need I like I like Green Day, but god damn it

789
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:38,480
They got too fucking political

790
00:44:38,480 --> 00:44:40,480
Are they brothers?

791
00:44:40,480 --> 00:44:42,480
Maybe.

792
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:44,480
Let's see. Nope, they're not brothers. At least they have different last names.

793
00:44:44,480 --> 00:44:48,480
Yeah, their names are Orville and Wilbur Hitler.

794
00:44:48,480 --> 00:44:50,480
[Laughter]

795
00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:52,480
Aaron Sane and Frank Highland.

796
00:44:52,480 --> 00:44:54,480
Nashville, Tennessee, baby.

797
00:44:54,480 --> 00:44:56,480
I'm in love with Ann Coulter.

798
00:44:56,480 --> 00:45:00,480
Let me pull up some of the lyrics for this song.

799
00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:04,480
Yeah, I mean, I'm very interested. I'm not gonna lie.

800
00:45:04,480 --> 00:45:11,480
I'm in love with Ann Coulter, the sequel to I'm in Love with a Stripper.

801
00:45:11,480 --> 00:45:12,480
Hey-o!

802
00:45:12,480 --> 00:45:13,480
New rule!

803
00:45:13,480 --> 00:45:19,920
That was a very Bill Barr joke.

804
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:23,260
She's got blonde hair, long legs, and a powerful intellect.

805
00:45:23,260 --> 00:45:24,640
She's a writer, a real fighter.

806
00:45:24,640 --> 00:45:29,560
You could say she's on the cutting edge, and she captures my heart when she tears libs apart,

807
00:45:29,560 --> 00:45:31,560
and now I must confess things as they are.

808
00:45:31,560 --> 00:45:33,080
I'm in love with Ann Coulter.

809
00:45:33,080 --> 00:45:37,400
All I want to do is hold her and have her read her books to me just as she does in my dreams.

810
00:45:37,400 --> 00:45:40,080
I'm on their genius page.

811
00:45:40,080 --> 00:45:44,160
Here's the opening lyrics to a song by them called Shut Up and Teach.

812
00:45:44,160 --> 00:45:47,680
Nowhere in this textbook does it say, "Bush equals Hitler."

813
00:45:47,680 --> 00:45:50,600
And nowhere in this chapter does it claim, "We had it coming."

814
00:45:50,600 --> 00:45:53,200
No way in this world can you blame capitalism.

815
00:45:53,200 --> 00:45:55,920
No way on this earth will I be swayed.

816
00:45:55,920 --> 00:45:57,440
This is just, dude, this is dicker.

817
00:45:57,440 --> 00:45:58,440
This is awesome.

818
00:45:58,440 --> 00:45:59,440
Yeah.

819
00:45:59,440 --> 00:46:00,440
Yeah.

820
00:46:00,440 --> 00:46:01,440
Dude, oh my God, this is our values are under attack for sure.

821
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:06,640
Be force-fed any more of your liberal garbage and I will not write down what's on that board cuz it's so stupid

822
00:46:06,640 --> 00:46:14,960
It's called a textbook why don't you read it you'd be amazed at what you find inside

823
00:46:14,960 --> 00:46:18,880
It's nothing like what you've been feeding. I guess you must have thought we were blind

824
00:46:18,880 --> 00:46:25,000
Damn, or that we couldn't read the course of this is literally just our values are under attack

825
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:30,240
Shut up and teach don't give a speech keep your political beliefs all to yourself until the bell

826
00:46:30,240 --> 00:46:37,240
Your job, as far as I can tell, doesn't include indoctrination, so could you please shut up and teach?

827
00:46:37,240 --> 00:46:42,120
God damn dude see that dude this is Danzig's right the two that the two

828
00:46:42,120 --> 00:46:49,760
Albums that the Wright brothers have at least on YouTube are no apologies and then their second album their sophomoric release

829
00:46:49,760 --> 00:46:54,600
Remember a military appreciation project I

00:47:18,700 --> 00:47:23,920
There's a crisis on this planet it's heated up almost a whole degree

835
00:47:23,920 --> 00:47:29,440
It hasn't been this hot in a long time not since the 16th century when there were no evil SUVs

836
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:34,000
Stop global whining his name is al gore yeah he's a loser.

839
00:47:55,840 --> 00:48:01,300
Nickelodeon like live action actor decides like I'm gonna I'm I'm making a

841
00:48:05,440 --> 00:48:12,000

848
00:48:49,800 --> 00:48:57,820
stage name now. Oh that's awesome. Yeah. Drake Bell, I'm on Drake Bell's Wikipedia.

849
00:48:57,820 --> 00:49:02,080
Influent, Bell has described his music as being heavily influenced by the Beatles.

850
00:49:02,080 --> 00:49:06,160
Okay I'm on the I'm on the Wright Brothers, like they don't have very many

851
00:49:06,160 --> 00:49:11,480
lyrics anywhere. I know, it's so hard to find their shit. I found this website lyricsdb.co, they only have one

852
00:49:11,480 --> 00:49:15,920
Wright Brothers song. I don't, this, the way this is written does not sound like

853
00:49:15,920 --> 00:49:20,680
the Wright Brothers. I'm not sure. Hook ain't nowhere to run to. There ain't nothing here

854
00:49:20,680 --> 00:49:25,400
for free. Freedom is not free by the Wright Brothers. Here's verse one. If I don't like

855
00:49:25,400 --> 00:49:30,020
my life, I gut it and rebuild it. Fuck it. Keep nothing but God and my children. I kill

856
00:49:30,020 --> 00:49:35,480
the devil wherever he resides. Even if he hides in me, he got to die. I killed little

857
00:49:35,480 --> 00:49:41,080
Jason. He was only 15. Sewed his good traits together. Made Ali. I don't think that this

858
00:49:41,080 --> 00:49:44,520
This is when they were the Reich Brothers.

859
00:49:44,520 --> 00:49:45,520
Yeah.

860
00:49:45,520 --> 00:49:48,760
And the conservatives set the tone it down.

861
00:49:48,760 --> 00:49:49,760
Yeah.

862
00:49:49,760 --> 00:49:51,480
Alright brothers, hey Hollywood.

863
00:49:51,480 --> 00:49:53,320
I'm really gonna see if I can find this.

864
00:49:53,320 --> 00:49:54,720
I'm having like a moment where I'm stuck on it.

865
00:49:54,720 --> 00:49:55,720
I think you can listen.

866
00:49:55,720 --> 00:50:00,280
That's what I was gonna say, I was gonna like listen and like transcribe it maybe.

867
00:50:00,280 --> 00:50:08,040

902
00:52:29,680 --> 00:52:35,040
thickest skinned person in the world. The God's strongest soldier is somebody who chooses to

00:53:30,400 --> 00:53:36,840
searching teddy boys, like some of it literally just looks like, like a poop on their head.

918
00:53:36,840 --> 00:53:44,360
It's like you put a fucking, it's like, it's like a, HR Geiger drew a fucking, drew like

Yeah, it's like, it's all black leather and shit.

00:53:58,560 --> 00:54:03,280
Dude, that will just like, you walk into a room with someone with that much pomade, it's

924
00:54:03,280 --> 00:54:05,280
just going to pickle you instantly.

925
00:54:05,280 --> 00:54:06,680

There was, I never purchased it.

927
00:54:09,280 --> 00:54:16,280

928
00:54:16,280 --> 00:54:17,280
near fire."

929
00:54:17,280 --> 00:54:33,080
I mean this is basically like what mercury poisoning is right I like I like the idea of like all these like like rockabilly guys like like like one third of them like went insane because of the amount of pomade that was on their head

930
00:54:33,080 --> 00:54:35,800
Yeah, it seeped into their brain.

931
00:54:35,800 --> 00:54:37,640
Yeah, it just made them completely slick.

932
00:54:37,640 --> 00:54:43,160
It made them talk permanently like Elvis, who already sort of sounds like he has something going on.

933
00:54:43,160 --> 00:54:47,800
Oh, man, would you pass the salt, man?

You go to school and you hear someone sing the Blake flushing Barney down a toilet song for the first time

982
00:57:51,640 --> 00:57:58,480

983
00:57:58,480 --> 00:58:03,640

You're like enjoying Barney and you're just enjoy you're just like yeah, he wants to he says everyone should love each other

You have to you're like, no, I didn't I was just why I believe you though. Yeah

00:58:38,120 --> 00:58:42,740
I don't know what right out of 30 page screed and crayon how you won't be watching Barney anymore

991
00:58:45,040 --> 00:58:49,800
It is sad. It's like the first time but also that's like also that's also the same moment

992
00:58:49,800 --> 00:58:55,180
You discover like how you can be funny. I feel like it's like, oh, yeah, you could just you can make fun of a guy

993
00:58:55,180 --> 00:58:59,840
And that's one way to be funny and it's the same moment mean. Yeah, basically

994
00:58:59,840 --> 00:59:06,200
Man Barney Barney. It's funny with Barney cuz like my parents like talk about like the kid shows

995
00:59:06,200 --> 00:59:08,920
We watch and they were like they made us watch made us

996
00:59:08,920 --> 00:59:10,960
I mean like they put on a lot of Sesame Street, which is great

997
00:59:10,960 --> 00:59:13,940
You know says me streets just like very good or at least was I don't know

998
00:59:13,940 --> 00:59:15,480
I haven't watched it in a while.

999
00:59:15,480 --> 00:59:17,680
- It took me a long time to grow out of Sesame Street.

1000
00:59:17,680 --> 00:59:18,520
(laughing)

1001
00:59:18,520 --> 00:59:20,540
I just, I liked the puppets too much.

1002
00:59:20,540 --> 00:59:21,380
Like I liked the puppets.

1003
00:59:21,380 --> 00:59:22,220
- Oh true.

1004
00:59:22,220 --> 00:59:23,800
- Like I just, I loved puppets as a kid

1005
00:59:23,800 --> 00:59:25,920
that I was like, yeah, I know it's for like babies,

1006
00:59:25,920 --> 00:59:26,760
but like I like--

1007
00:59:26,760 --> 00:59:28,480
- That's fucking clever, it's good.

1008
00:59:28,480 --> 00:59:30,080
But then like my parents would be like,

1009
00:59:30,080 --> 00:59:31,760
yeah, but Barney, man.

1010
00:59:31,760 --> 00:59:32,600
- Yeah.

1011
00:59:32,600 --> 00:59:34,460
- The thing about Barney is he had like,

1012
00:59:34,460 --> 00:59:38,120
even among like, like kids show voices,

1013
00:59:38,120 --> 00:59:39,680
which are like really bad,

1014
00:59:39,680 --> 00:59:41,960
the Barney characters have the absolute worst.

1015
00:59:41,960 --> 00:59:44,960
Yeah, Barney's like, "Woo-woo-woo-woo-woo-woo!"

1016
00:59:44,960 --> 00:59:48,960
And then Baby Bop just does the baby voice.

1017
00:59:48,960 --> 00:59:49,960
Evil.

1018
00:59:49,960 --> 00:59:50,960
Yeah, it's not good.

1019
00:59:50,960 --> 00:59:55,960
My mom told me when I was younger, she told me this pretty young.

1020
00:59:55,960 --> 01:00:03,960
I think I was like 7 or 8 when she told me why she didn't buy me the Po Teletubby toy.

1021
01:00:03,960 --> 01:00:05,960
Back to Po.

1022
01:00:05,960 --> 01:00:16,960
She told me she didn't buy me the Po one because apparently like what like they don't they speak like gibberish like Teletubby language is like not fucking.

1023
01:00:16,960 --> 01:00:31,960
Teletubby language is not real English but they speak like whatever they're saying but my mom said like she didn't buy it for me because she thought that Po was saying F-A-G-I-T F-A-G-I-T bite my bum.

1024
01:00:31,960 --> 01:00:33,960
*laughter*

1025
01:00:33,960 --> 01:00:35,960
What the fuck?

1026
01:00:35,960 --> 01:00:37,960
Not spelling it out like that, like saying it.

1027
01:00:37,960 --> 01:00:41,960
Oh, I mean, well, either way.

1028
01:00:41,960 --> 01:00:43,960
Why would Mel say that?

1029
01:00:43,960 --> 01:00:45,960
She told me that when I was like 7 or 8.

1030
01:00:45,960 --> 01:00:51,960
And then I, like, when you're 7 or 8, you think that's fucking hilarious, so you go around the house repeating it.

1031
01:00:51,960 --> 01:00:53,960
Yeah.

1032
01:00:53,960 --> 01:00:55,960
So, for like a week, I was just saying that.

1033
01:00:55,960 --> 01:00:59,960
Also, like, spelling that word wrong is what made me laugh.

1034
01:00:59,960 --> 01:01:03,960
laugh. Oh yeah, I didn't want to spell it out actually.

1035
01:01:03,960 --> 01:01:07,960
But that's what's funny, the idea of like a

1036
01:01:07,960 --> 01:01:11,960
six year old programming Po spelling

1037
01:01:11,960 --> 01:01:15,960
the word wrong.

1038
01:01:15,960 --> 01:01:19,960
Yeah, the factory in Indonesia that all the Po toys were processed in

1039
01:01:19,960 --> 01:01:23,960
they were like, "We're going to make these children homophobic!"

1040
01:01:23,960 --> 01:01:27,960
English was their second language so they couldn't spell it right.

1041
01:01:27,960 --> 01:01:32,760
homophobic. Also I do want so did your mom think Poe was saying that or did your

1042
01:01:32,760 --> 01:01:35,680
mom think like Poe just it just sounded like the gibberish that's what the

1043
01:01:35,680 --> 01:01:39,320
gibberish sounded like. Yeah she thought the gibberish sounded like. Yeah okay cool it was like I was like

1044
01:01:39,320 --> 01:01:45,280
did your mom your mom was like this fucking alien is homophobic. No. My son is

1045
01:01:45,280 --> 01:01:49,240
not gonna listen to this yeah no. That's funny yeah I guess you can really you can go

1046
01:01:49,240 --> 01:01:53,280
wrong in a couple ways with gibberish because it can be racist or you could

1047
01:01:53,280 --> 01:01:57,960
just you can just yeah accidentally say words you shouldn't say yeah like there

1048
01:01:57,960 --> 01:02:02,520
was like a fuck I remember this news story like me and my younger brother

1049
01:02:02,520 --> 01:02:07,940
were like watching the news with my mom before school and there was like a like

1050
01:02:07,940 --> 01:02:12,160
an Elmo doll that's that like I guess like the speaker must have shortened out

1051
01:02:12,160 --> 01:02:16,440
or something yeah like a kid named James got an Elmo doll that was going kill

1052
01:02:16,440 --> 01:02:18,440
James

1053
01:02:18,440 --> 01:02:38,320
Also, just like just like oh man, yeah, I think

1054
01:02:38,320 --> 01:02:44,360
There's this guy outside my window. I think his speaker shorted out. He keeps saying he's gonna kill me

1055
01:02:44,360 --> 01:02:49,260
He's just short-circuiting.

1056
01:02:49,260 --> 01:02:53,480
That's all the speaker like the speakers and toys sorting out is one of the funniest things

1057
01:02:53,480 --> 01:02:54,480
as a kid.

1058
01:02:54,480 --> 01:03:01,960
Like this is exactly how we had a monkey toy that like it was it would go like like that's

1059
01:03:01,960 --> 01:03:02,960
what it's supposed to do.

1060
01:03:02,960 --> 01:03:09,440
Yeah, like after a while it broke and you press the button just like screech.

1061
01:03:09,440 --> 01:03:14,680
We had another, we had a Halloween decoration that was like a skeleton that if you like

1062
01:03:14,680 --> 01:03:20,280
moved it, it had like a motion sensor, it would do like that like fake silly evil laugh from

1063
01:03:20,280 --> 01:03:25,800
Saw you know like "oh ho ho ho he he he" but then it got wet one year and then the next

1064
01:03:25,800 --> 01:03:28,600
We used it if you like if you brush

1065
01:03:28,600 --> 01:03:36,160
Like squawking noise

1066
01:03:36,160 --> 01:03:39,020
It was like actually scared people

1067
01:03:39,020 --> 01:03:42,280
We had like a Patrick star

1068
01:03:42,280 --> 01:03:44,600
toy in my house that uh

1069
01:03:44,600 --> 01:03:47,920
When you press it had like a few phrases it said it would say like hey

1070
01:03:47,920 --> 01:03:53,760
I'm a starfish and like duh that tickles and like it would always be when you pressed it and me and my friends would just

1071
01:03:53,760 --> 01:03:59,220
like chuck it at each other's heads and so eventually it like busted to the point

1072
01:03:59,220 --> 01:04:03,640
where like I would just be like gaming late at night and I would just hear hey

1073
01:04:03,640 --> 01:04:09,640
I'm a starfish from like the other room and I was like holy shit like it's so

1074
01:04:09,640 --> 01:04:15,840
scared like it would just talk at completely random times when nobody

1075
01:04:15,840 --> 01:04:21,520
engaged with the cobalt that lives in your walls was was playing with it

1076
01:04:21,520 --> 01:04:23,520
Yeah

1077
01:04:23,520 --> 01:04:29,740
You had you had fairies in your house dude, uh, and I'm not talking about you and your family. Oh
