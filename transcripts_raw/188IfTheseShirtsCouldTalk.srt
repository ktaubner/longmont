Uh-huh.

Stop before it gets stuck in my fucking head.

17
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:37,800
It's already stuck in your head, bro.

18
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:38,800
Yeah, it's too late for you.

19
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:39,800
What?

20
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:40,800
It's already stuck in your head.

00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:41,800
What did, what?

22
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:42,800
Well, you know what we've not had in decades?

23
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:43,800
A meme like that?

24
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:44,800
Or a decade?

25
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:49,560
An infectious internet song that gets stuck in your head for days and days and days.

26
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:50,560
Double rainbow autotune?

27
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:51,560
Remember that one?

28
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:52,560
No, double rainbow, no schmoyoho.

29
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:53,560
No, you don't remember that?

30
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:57,960
Oh, I thought you were saying no as in, these are Patches headphones, I will hold onto them.

31
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:02,960
that you're saying no as in you mean that not that one. No, that one thing there

32
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:06,200
hasn't been one since then. Yeah, it was corn. That one was

33
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:13,200
that was a flash in the exactly the same. That's exactly the same as a flash in

34
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:17,300
the ones that's him. That's him. That's a schmoyoho. Yeah, but it's not the

35
00:01:17,300 --> 00:01:20,200
same. It wasn't as good as for normies, but that's the only reason you're

36
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:23,800
discounting it is because it was for normies. I know the older one for the

37
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:29,320
weird yeah normies hated schmoyoho beat up every day because I had a schmoyoho

38
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:33,760
shirt a t shirt that I got it would happen and I would get this kick down

39
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:40,680
who my teeth fans schmoyoho we got get fucking brutalized. It was like yeah,

40
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:44,280
it was like when you when people find out you're a pedophile in prison people

41
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:49,400
they would kill it. I saw one time I saw a dude wearing a an auto tune the news

42
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:54,120
t-shirt. He was just walking down the street and this dude stops his car,

43
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:59,120
pulls around, throws him mouth first onto a curb and just

44
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:04,480
decks his head out with his foot. I thought you were gonna say throws a

45
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:07,040
splattering goo on him. No. Based on that sound.

46
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:11,040
That was the goo. The goo came out of his head. It was like a slime ball.

47
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:14,800
'Cause his head cracked in half. You're thinking of that movie. That didn't

48
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:15,200
happen.

49
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:22,220
I saw it in black and white when it happened to because it was scary long

50
00:02:22,220 --> 00:02:26,420
ago. Yeah, that went in my head when I picture it, it is in black and white.

51
00:02:26,420 --> 00:02:29,200
I've never seen that movie, man. I'm gonna be real with you. Probably. I

52
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:32,320
don't really care about that movie. No, I don't think that we should be making

53
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:33,960
movies about Nazis.

54
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:38,980
That's about a Nazi? I see enough... Speak on that. I see probably 40, 50

55
00:02:38,980 --> 00:02:42,840
Nazis every single day when I walk down the street. I don't need... And nobody

56
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:46,360
say I'm passing by windows... Or the mirror store. And watching... Seeing my

57
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:50,560
No, no, no, don't say that. Because you go to the mirror store every day? Yeah,

58
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:51,320
because I'm beautiful.

59
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:57,760
Fuck yeah, I go to the mirror store. Okay. Does that make you mad? There's a

60
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:01,200
chandelier store around here. Yeah, I know that one. I think I almost went to

61
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:04,320
it. We should make a movie about it. It's so... Oh, your camera angle's so

62
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:08,520
messed up today. Look at that. What the hell did you do? Look at that angle.

63
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:14,960
It's kind of a European style. I like that. It's like we should just have a

64
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,800
video wall for Cameron to point at right here. I think that the the

65
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:25,800
chandelier show is kind of its hubris because it's like they have the lights

66
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:31,240
on 24/7 and they have the just it's just these gigantic glass and crystal

67
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:35,000
chandeliers that are just in there and they have the whole all the walls of the

68
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:39,560
entire building are glass. Yeah, and you can see in there every time of every day

69
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:44,200
and you know the only reason why they have one here is because there's no

70
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:48,240
earthquakes. Yep, because an earthquake in the chandelier store that could

71
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:51,640
first of all, can you imagine that now, but there's going to be an earthquake.

72
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:55,640
Can you imagine that that moment we know in movies when the chandelier starts

73
00:03:55,640 --> 00:04:00,440
shaking? Yeah, if every chandelier in that store starts shaking around,

74
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:03,840
that'd be the worst. What the hell's going on? Owning a chandelier store in

75
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:07,040
San Francisco. See, we're not in trouble of earthquakes here. We're in trouble

76
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:11,140
of giant monsters. Yeah, this is the city that gets destroyed by a king kong.

77
00:04:11,140 --> 00:04:14,740
Yes, that's where yeah, that's where a monster, a Hulk type monster would be

78
00:04:14,740 --> 00:04:18,420
fighting someone in there. Yeah, bull. Hulk's not a monster, but I take your

79
00:04:18,420 --> 00:04:23,100
point. He is a monster. He's a monster. He's a larger than life personality. He's

80
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:27,260
a monster. He's a monster. He's a monster and he's a piece of shit. Not a piece of

81
00:04:27,260 --> 00:04:31,380
shit. He's a big a Bruce Banner. You're thinking of Bruce Banner. Bruce Banner is

82
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:37,020
a meek, fucking nerd. Nerd. Yeah. Right. The Hulk is a larger than life bomb.

83
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:42,120
monster is a bombastic kind of guy is bombastic. He's very bomb. I missed the

84
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:48,040
bombastic. He's not he's not a shaggy as Mr. Bean. He dances for that. He didn't

85
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:49,660
say Mr. Bombay. He is a

86
00:04:49,660 --> 00:04:54,640
bombastic Mr. Bean couldn't string two words together. If you try to Pam yeah,

87
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:59,160
he does he says he says two words. Sometimes always not a word to is a word

88
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:02,160
he'll do a sound in a word. He's not even saying oh yeah, he's saying

89
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:06,280
that's a noise. You couldn't write down

90
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:12,520
That's a weird sound. Oh, what? That's not even Mr. Bean. This is me doing a new

91
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:17,320
sound. I think you need to be a Bean too. Yeah, you need to be Bean too back in

92
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:21,480
action. Bean too? Yeah, I think that you could be. Bean too is Johnny English.

93
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:24,920
Yeah. So I would be a spy. Y'all remember Johnny English? Not really. I get it

94
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:29,480
confused with that Steve Carell movie. You should check it out. I get that very

95
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:33,560
confused with the Steve Carell movie about being a spy. Get Smart, where there's

96
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:38,780
a bead curtain in that movie. Yeah, one yeah, we need a bead curtain for the

97
00:05:38,780 --> 00:05:42,200
off that we should just replace the front door with a bead curtain. So these

98
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:46,380
riffraff can just walk in yeah. I think I need a bead curtain for my house.

99
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:50,320
Yeah, yeah, I need some price. I would fit yeah, no wouldn't that would fit. I

100
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:56,440
don't know wouldn't it. They're like a tiki hut white ivory beans, beans,

101
00:05:56,440 --> 00:06:00,620
beans, you can make it out of you can make it out of canele beans. No, that

102
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:05,040
black. I he's saying what if it gets hot, what if it gets so humid, buddy, if it

103
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:09,040
gets hot, you got beans on a string and you can just sit there and eat them.

104
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:12,180
Yeah, I don't want it, but that's just one walking through just go

105
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:18,080

107
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:26,520

108
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:32,240
vaginal euphemism yeah yeah, I'm sticking in your beans and I'm finding

109
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:37,780

with everybody that I was playing Valorant with. I was like, "What the

162
00:09:28,660 --> 00:09:32,400
fuck are you doing?" I was like, "I'm begging my wife to let me play video

163
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:34,800
games for another ninety minutes. What are you doing, asshole?"

164
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:39,560
Yeah, so I pretty much got embarrassed. Wow! You know, that's shameful. We've

165
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:43,640
She's been saying bad news. I had a moment of shame. See, this is alright, go through

166
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:47,560
with it. Shame is good. I empowered me up for today. I'll say it. What else? This happened

167
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:51,960
to me a few days ago and I betrayed my trust in somebody. What'd you do? And then I was

168
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:57,800
set on the right path by the universe. What? What I betrayed. So basically, I was running

169
00:09:57,800 --> 00:10:02,000
on the treadmill at the gym. No, I didn't betray Patrick. Oh. Not this time. I didn't

170
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:06,600
betray either of you. Okay. I betrayed somebody related to you. Thank God. I was on the treadmill

171
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:09,460
at the gym and they have the tv attachment. I was flipping through the

172
00:10:09,460 --> 00:10:12,520
channels. I was like, I just need something to look at while I'm running.

173
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:15,420
What am I going to look at? I go to the travel channel. What's on the travel

174
00:10:15,420 --> 00:10:20,500
channel? Ghost adventures. You know, you did not watch that fucking dildo. Zach

175
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:24,860
Bagans and we know and yeah, I feel really bad about this. We have a clean

176
00:10:24,860 --> 00:10:30,240
about it. We have a by proxy beef with that mother. Zach Bagans because of my

177
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:33,240
uncle Matt, he doesn't like him. He doesn't like him and I shouldn't have

178
00:10:33,260 --> 00:10:36,860
watched it. You shouldn't have done it. I watched. I just left it on. It was I

179
00:10:36,860 --> 00:10:39,960
couldn't even hear the sound or anything. Did you at least watch it to make fun of

180
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:43,260
it? The captions were all the closed captions are doing that thing that closed

181
00:10:43,260 --> 00:10:46,460
captions do all the time for some reason. Do you know what I mean? Where

182
00:10:46,460 --> 00:10:50,360
they're just words on the screen. It just completely all it turns into symbols.

183
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:53,660
Oh, yeah. Yeah. I don't know why that happened, but so I was barely even

184
00:10:53,660 --> 00:10:58,560
watched. So I shouldn't even even had it on. Okay, I but it's just on I'm

185
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:02,460
looking at it. Did you try at the end of the end of now? Listen at the end of

186
00:11:02,460 --> 00:11:05,720
my run. I got off to go get the paper towels to wipe down the treadmill. I

187
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:10,620
left on the TV thing. Yeah, I come back and what is on the screen on go from

188
00:11:10,620 --> 00:11:14,160
Ghost Adventures, but it's just cutting between a bunch of pictures of cake

189
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:19,340
and it looks like you're running. It looks like I was running on the

190
00:11:19,340 --> 00:11:21,660
treadmill and watching a documentary

191
00:11:21,660 --> 00:11:29,080
oh man, that's good. You're running on me. It taught you a lesson. I mean me

192
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:32,260
never to watch Ghost Adventures, because they are putting fucked up shit on the

193
00:11:32,300 --> 00:11:36,040
screen. I just had all this bad boy. Okay, I'm sorry. I had the most

194
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:42,240
incredible idea on the treadmill. The TV should be behind you, and then you

195
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:45,320
can put on something like a KKK slideshow and you're running away from

196
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:51,840
it or a bear or a bear two options or yeah or something kind of scary or

197
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:57,280
a bear. A scary movie. Yeah, well, my my my fiance said that what you know

198
00:11:57,280 --> 00:11:59,840
how they have the also the treadmills where they do like the video run where

199
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:02,240
that shows the screen and you're like running through like a street or

200
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:05,360
something. She said one of the ones at the gym has one where you run and you

201
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:09,260
run into the White House. Like, really? Like, January 6th. Oh, that's cool.

202
00:12:09,260 --> 00:12:10,280
That is sick.

203
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:15,800
That's so awesome. Getting all dressed up to go do that.

204
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:21,400
But there is some incredible news this morning. What's coming out? I mean, I

205
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:26,880
just, I could not believe it when I saw my eyes. I look, I'm... You're sweet.

206
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:30,640
I'm here. How do you mirror store up so bad already? I did not even believe

207
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:34,320
you guys. I cannot believe this one. I even saw my eyes open up this morning

208
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:35,120
to see it.

209
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:41,000
I look down. I look down. I'm looking at my I'm looking at my phone black

210
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:45,840
screen. I see my eyes. Click open. Click open. What I'm expecting to see

211
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:51,240
is a notification from Apple News that says something like this bloody

212
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:57,880
the pandemic is in perpetuity. Global warming has accelerated. I'm expecting

213
00:12:57,880 --> 00:13:04,160
some terribly bad news, but what do I see? A little red YouTube play button,

214
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:04,660
right?

215
00:13:04,660 --> 00:13:12,200
You got 50 subscribers. No, even better. Notification, because I hit the bell for

216
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:12,920
this person.

217
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:20,520
Jake Novak is back. Oh, I saw this. Jake Novak is back as fuck. That was the

218
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:23,720
first thing I did when I woke up this morning, me to that I opened my eyes

219
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:26,460
and I took on my phone. I saw the text and I watched the whole video. It was a

220
00:13:26,460 --> 00:13:32,660
man and he is a bang back in a camera work way. The guys are the best. I am so

221
00:13:32,660 --> 00:13:37,980
I'm so happy he's back. I cannot wait for his next heater to come out. Hope

222
00:13:37,980 --> 00:13:41,340
it's a song. I fucking hope it. I thought he was going to break in a song

223
00:13:41,340 --> 00:13:44,520
the whole time and I was so fucking excited on the edge of my seat, but I

224
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:49,180
was so honestly the respect that I have for him just skyrocketed because he did

225
00:13:49,220 --> 00:13:56,460
not do a song, mys and sen. Yes, Mermi's and cinematography, zoom

226
00:13:56,460 --> 00:14:02,220
a zoom, a big zoom panning to show a food Spielberg vibes.

227
00:14:02,220 --> 00:14:08,680
Definitely it was incredible. Yeah, the fable men ask for sure. Yeah, but it

228
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:12,880
was an amazing video. I was so impressed. We need to make something

229
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:17,440
that is a perfect masterpiece. Yeah, because we are, we are, Jake Novak's

230
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:21,480
couple years older than us I'd imagine because we have accomplished a half

231
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:23,480
year older than our average age.

232
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:27,040
I think that we were in college at the same time as him.

233
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:29,040
How old actually is he?

234
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:33,740
I think he was graduating during my freshman year.

235
00:14:33,740 --> 00:14:35,540
So you were probably in high school.

236
00:14:35,540 --> 00:14:39,540
Because you're young.

237
00:14:39,540 --> 00:14:40,840
Cameron's a little boy.

238
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:41,840
I'm still in high school.

239
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:44,640
Yeah, I bet you were so hot in high school.

240
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:45,640
Bro, you have no idea.

241
00:14:46,140 --> 00:14:50,540
high school pics you was even bad then. I bet you were. See look at you giggle.

242
00:14:50,540 --> 00:14:55,460
You were hot. Admit it. You were hot as fuck.

243
00:14:55,460 --> 00:15:00,660
I bet you wore sweatpants every day. Yep. I've told you that before. Adidas

244
00:15:00,660 --> 00:15:05,220
sweatpants. No. Oh, I was so close. Really? You thought I wore Adidas? He

245
00:15:05,220 --> 00:15:08,180
wore Nike Tech. Really, really tight ones. He wore Nike Tech every day to school.

246
00:15:08,180 --> 00:15:12,340
I wore pyjama pants. And you had that pipe. That pipe. That pipe. He had that

247
00:15:12,340 --> 00:15:17,540
pipe. Yeah, that pipe I would smoke. Yeah, no, yeah, that pipe in those shorts

248
00:15:17,540 --> 00:15:21,760
walk around with that pipe. All your teachers are like this in class and

249
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:25,360
they're like you cannot smoke that and he's like there's nothing in it. Yeah,

250
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:29,160
it's a bubble pipe from Sponge Bob. Do you guys remember the first time you

251
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:30,240
saw a jewel? Yeah,

252
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:33,560
oh,

253
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:35,420
it was in a chest.

254
00:15:35,420 --> 00:15:40,580
It was in a big red Ruby and it was glimmering.

255
00:15:41,580 --> 00:15:46,580
I've even seen one now. Yeah, we've never seen one. I mean, maybe you've seen one.

256
00:15:46,580 --> 00:15:50,280
That's not what I was talking about, but you've seen a jewel. Okay, I definitely

257
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:53,420
have, but I also and also that feels like something for the first one I saw

258
00:15:53,420 --> 00:15:56,080
of those, but it feels like that's something that you should remember. It's

259
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:56,940
like kind of cool

260
00:15:56,940 --> 00:16:00,820
the jewel. I remember a lot of different jewels that I've seen, but I don't

261
00:16:00,820 --> 00:16:04,780
remember which one was first. Yeah, I don't remember the first time I saw a

262
00:16:04,780 --> 00:16:08,620
jewel smoking device. Now yeah, I remember it because I it was so confusing

263
00:16:08,660 --> 00:16:13,660
at me because I was in school and yeah, you were you and I had it. Yeah, it was

264
00:16:13,660 --> 00:16:17,900
like and I fully thought it was a USB stick thing and I was like, what the

265
00:16:17,900 --> 00:16:22,440
fuck? And he's like, it's a vape. Whoa, I was like, whoa, yeah, I don't it must

266
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:25,500
have been college when I saw one. It might have been you having one. It was

267
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:28,940
definitely I was my senior year of high school. Ain't no way because we were not

268
00:16:28,940 --> 00:16:33,980
everybody in North Carolina had the had mods. Oh yeah, that makes a gas. The big

269
00:16:34,020 --> 00:16:41,220
vapes that are like this. Yeah. The one. My first my roommate at community college had

270
00:16:41,220 --> 00:16:48,360
one and he had a big pink Floyd tapestry on it. No, behind him. He had to just sit there

271
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:52,840
and he would like blow like that fucking picture. Chris Maggio took the fucking dude blowing

272
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:57,740
the smoke into the into the tapestry. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. He would basically do that

273
00:16:57,740 --> 00:17:02,500
every day. That's cool. Yeah, it was sick. He had that. And then on the other side of

274
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:06,480
the wall big ass or like tapestry sized American flag. Can that affect your

275
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:11,280
tapestry? Yes. Are you kidding? It makes it trippy. It makes it come to life.

276
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:16,540
Yeah. The nicotine makes it come to life like Night at the Museum. Uh-huh. It makes all

277
00:17:16,540 --> 00:17:24,240
of the the colors on the Pink Floyd triangle. It makes all of them move. Have

278
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:26,960
we already talked about what would be the best place to have Night at the Museum

279
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:31,400
happen? Yeah, I think so. I think we said the wax museum.

280
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:37,280
Fame. That doesn't sound like that. No, I wouldn't say that. I don't like celebrity. I don't like

281
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:41,160
fame and stuff. You don't like fame. It's not my kind of thing. I like my fame. I don't

282
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:44,840
like other people who are famous. I would get too jealous. I think yeah. I also think

283
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:49,440
the attitude of famous people can be sour at best. What if there was a night at the

284
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:55,680
museum situation at the wax museum though and see we never talked in the first idea

285
00:17:55,680 --> 00:18:00,540
and it's a bad idea. The Queen of England starts coming on to you right. She starts trying

286
00:18:00,540 --> 00:18:04,760
to kiss you with those big wax lips. You can't fucking hear, they're all one year old. You're

287
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:09,300
getting hot and heavy. No, because they're made of celebrities hair and stuff. They don't

288
00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:12,500
use their real hair. They put their hair in them. No, they use. I thought it was a voodoo

289
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:16,140
thing. No, you did not think that. You didn't think that at all. I thought it was a voodoo

290
00:18:16,140 --> 00:18:20,880
type scenario. No, you didn't. No. Home Depot. You must be on a voodoo fucking ranger because

291
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:27,100
you're acting drunk. Am I? Yeah. I don't believe that's so. You don't believe that is so? I

292
00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:30,260
I believe that is so a wax museum. I don't think would be that good, because

293
00:18:30,260 --> 00:18:33,620
I think that everybody's going to be in the middle of they're going to if they

294
00:18:33,620 --> 00:18:36,560
cut the celebrities come to life, they're going to be in the middle of

295
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:38,140
whatever they were. They were like

296
00:18:38,140 --> 00:18:44,460
well, it yeah, so it's going to be Bo Jackson do like running. That's also

297
00:18:44,460 --> 00:18:48,380
your that's also just that's just night at the museum. Basically yeah, exactly

298
00:18:48,380 --> 00:18:53,420
yeah, that's not it. I have that and I have I guess it is a wax without the

299
00:18:53,460 --> 00:18:57,380
caveman yeah. I don't even get the caddy roosevelt it's it's a more boring night

300
00:18:57,380 --> 00:19:01,760
at the museum yeah. What I got hang on the worst ever answer yeah yeah, maybe

301
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:06,180
the worst ever answer it's more it's more just the gram norton even any store

302
00:19:06,180 --> 00:19:10,100
is a better answer. Yeah, I guess you could do the gram norton yeah. If you

303
00:19:10,100 --> 00:19:13,180
didn't, I mean not a museum, he should have done the gram norton yeah, you

304
00:19:13,180 --> 00:19:17,500
should just have been sitting in the lobby yeah, ask teddy roosevelt about

305
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:23,420
his favorite foods and chin and made him a sexual game yeah with squanto and

306
00:19:23,420 --> 00:19:27,820
them. Teddy Roosevelt and Squanto. Oh, that's his Native American friend? No,

307
00:19:27,820 --> 00:19:30,860
Squanto was from Thanksgiving. Yeah, he was one of the

308
00:19:30,860 --> 00:19:35,300
the gods of Thanksgiving. He's one of the gods of Thanksgiving. Yeah. Oh, I

309
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:37,520
don't know anything about that story. Squanto and Samoset.

310
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:40,900
We didn't learn- The gods of Thanksgiving sounds incredible. You never

311
00:19:40,900 --> 00:19:43,100
learned about Squanto and Samoset? I did

312
00:19:43,100 --> 00:19:48,580
the- I was a Native American in a play, the Thanksgiving play when I was a

313
00:19:48,580 --> 00:19:51,060
kid, and that was the last time I learned about Thanksgiving, because I

314
00:19:51,060 --> 00:19:56,420
I learned that it was I was wrong yeah yeah. I had the feather head on and I

315
00:19:56,420 --> 00:20:00,680
did a couple of these a couple of a couple of loud fast, you're bored by the

316
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:02,580
material yeah it's not that interesting.

317
00:20:02,580 --> 00:20:07,580
Elementary yeah, I know it really seemed childish, so then I skipped four or five

318
00:20:07,580 --> 00:20:11,680
grades, went back down to actually two grades under where I was because I

319
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:15,820
realized I had under you said underwear. You said two grades under where I was

320
00:20:15,820 --> 00:20:18,540
see okay. Now you can't pack can't do that.

321
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:22,400
you can I'll accept it from you.

322
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:29,660
I'll accept that from you, but yeah, so I went up a couple grades down to under

323
00:20:29,660 --> 00:20:31,840
the grade that I was in

324
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:37,600
and then two more down and then I kind of floated around there for four or five

325
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:40,780
years. The same kind of bumped up and down grades four or five years,

326
00:20:40,780 --> 00:20:45,140
kind of haunting grades, yeah, walking around. I was getting a lot taller than

327
00:20:45,140 --> 00:20:49,980
the other kids, so I grown breasts and then you can skip again and then you

328
00:20:50,060 --> 00:20:53,860
I mean if you stay in one grade for like four grades, you can skip ahead and then

329
00:20:53,860 --> 00:20:57,400
at that time at that point, it's time to get my driver's license and then I never

330
00:20:57,400 --> 00:21:01,540
looked back didn't fly school. It is so funny. I just did not go to school at

331
00:21:01,540 --> 00:21:05,220
all. Yeah, that's kind of what homeschooling is. If you if most people

332
00:21:05,220 --> 00:21:08,460
who are homeschooled don't listen to them when they say that they almost did

333
00:21:08,460 --> 00:21:12,140
normal, they did not do anything. No, yeah, it doesn't, but they just watch

334
00:21:12,140 --> 00:21:15,740
you would ever be able to. I watch YouTube. I played video games. Yeah, I

335
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:18,200
did about 20 minutes of Khan Academy every day.

336
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:21,160
- Dude, I almost was homeschooled when I was like eight.

337
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:22,600
- You would have been a bad candidate.

338
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:25,400
- I would have been so bad if I like, if I did.

339
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:26,240
- Would you consider yourself--

340
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:27,760
- I think it's because my mom thought I was weird.

341
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:29,460
- Would you say you're a self starter?

342
00:21:29,460 --> 00:21:32,180
- No, I don't know, it depends.

343
00:21:32,180 --> 00:21:33,440
- What does that mean, you do stuff?

344
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:35,320
- It means literally do you do stuff or no.

345
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:36,160
- Okay, yeah.

346
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:37,000
- Yeah.

347
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:37,820
- Oh man, it depends.

348
00:21:37,820 --> 00:21:38,660
- 'Cause I sure wasn't.

349
00:21:38,660 --> 00:21:40,120
You know what I did, I made desktop backgrounds.

350
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:40,960
- Yo.

351
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:41,780
- Yeah, that's right.

352
00:21:41,780 --> 00:21:42,620
- Me too.

353
00:21:42,620 --> 00:21:43,440
- Yeah, you were talking about that a while ago.

354
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:44,280
- I would make a--

355
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:47,280
I made Bokeh, I made a bunch of different pictures of Master Chief.

356
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:48,280
Uh-huh, that's sick.

357
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:53,280
You know, an 8x8 Master Chief, different photos, because they're all low res.

358
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:57,780
Yeah, I would draw pictures of dragons on Photoshop that were 100 pixels by 100 pixels

359
00:21:57,780 --> 00:21:59,780
and stretch it out to be my entire desktop.

360
00:21:59,780 --> 00:22:01,780
Why does it look so bad?

361
00:22:01,780 --> 00:22:06,280
Yeah, I learned how to use Photoshop and Adobe Premiere really, really badly.

362
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:07,780
Like, didn't learn how to use it.

363
00:22:07,780 --> 00:22:09,280
I was obsessed with Photoshop.

364
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:10,280
Me too.

365
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:12,280
I still am obsessed with Photoshop.

366
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:19,160
I use Gimp a lot. Yeah, you get you get like portable versions of software and

367
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:23,680
you bring it to school on a thumb drive and then you just I'd be playing like

368
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:27,280
Cave Story off a thumb drive. I'd be doing all this other stuff. I never did

369
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:32,000
anything like that. That is cringe. Yeah, I was 13 years old. You're an otaku. You

370
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:35,560
are an otaku. I don't remember why I played that game. Admit it. It was free.

371
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:39,000
Say I am an otaku. Cave Story is a fun game, but it played off a thumb drive at

372
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:43,560
high school is cringe. It was the smallest game I could put on the thumb drive.

373
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:47,240
Now you can do tic tac toe or palm. You could have played cool math games. Yeah,

374
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:52,120
I did just like a normal kid and con. There is a cool that's the one where you

375
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:56,680
can like play with other people right. You're thinking of every game ever. No,

376
00:22:56,680 --> 00:23:00,760
like there's a math game where you like send like the code or whatever and then

377
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:03,560
you have to do like the no, I don't know what you're talking about. Cool math

378
00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:07,480
games was the one it was cool. We used to do cool math games and fun brain fun

379
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:12,000
brain was so full mass games was the one where it's had nothing to do with math.

380
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:16,540
Yeah, just called that we were talking about brain age the other day. Oh yeah,

381
00:23:16,540 --> 00:23:20,780
how you guys are brain age academy brain age academy. No, was I talking to you

382
00:23:20,780 --> 00:23:24,400
about this? Yeah, you accused me of playing it. Yeah, you seemed like a

383
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:28,580
brain ager. No, you seemed like you would have a hundred year old brain. No,

384
00:23:28,580 --> 00:23:31,840
in the game. I didn't like stuff like that. What did you like growing up

385
00:23:32,260 --> 00:23:37,620
spectrobes. What's a spectro? I don't remember spectrobes. I don't ever heard

386
00:23:37,620 --> 00:23:40,760
that word in my life. Disney's JRPG for the DS.

387
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:46,220
Oh, I liked it. I thought that game was way bigger than it was. I like

388
00:23:46,220 --> 00:23:50,620
DaVinci, I like swords and sandals gladiators, and I liked

389
00:23:50,620 --> 00:23:51,780
I liked

390
00:23:51,780 --> 00:23:56,740
I like the Sabbath feudalism to the Sabbath tour. Yeah, I like to have a

391
00:23:56,740 --> 00:24:00,220
computer that could run that. It was on Xbox. I didn't. I liked all the

392
00:24:00,220 --> 00:24:03,340
games that were flash games with shooting guns because I couldn't get I

393
00:24:03,340 --> 00:24:07,580
wasn't allowed to have any of the actual. There was one that was called

394
00:24:07,580 --> 00:24:10,980
something. There was one that was like top down and I can't remember what it

395
00:24:10,980 --> 00:24:13,420
was called, but it was so sick and there were different levels and it was

396
00:24:13,420 --> 00:24:16,700
like all like different countries that you go to and kill people. I wasn't

397
00:24:16,700 --> 00:24:20,620
killing. It was kind of like Hotline Miami style. Oh nice, but it was like

398
00:24:20,620 --> 00:24:24,780
an on addicting games. There was this one I was addicted to called Madness

399
00:24:24,780 --> 00:24:29,640
combat that was so sick. It's like mortal combat. There was no it was like

400
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:34,240
you are. It was originally a flash game and it's a little gray guy and you're

401
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:38,200
supposed to like like shoot people and like throw your gun at them and then

402
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:42,960
grab their gun and so I do that. There was also there was a worms rip off

403
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:46,400
called territory war. Did you ever play that one? No, that one was fire

404
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:52,520
madness. Combine I played in those are some funny names of territory war

405
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:57,980
Madness Combat. I liked any flash game that had some funny shit like maybe Gary

406
00:24:57,980 --> 00:25:03,880
Busey or Nicolas Cage. You know what there was? There was this flash game on

407
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:07,600
Newgrounds that would get DMCA'd all the time and then people would re-upload it,

408
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:12,620
but it was called... I've talked about this before for sure, but it was called

409
00:25:12,620 --> 00:25:18,920
Bill Cosby's Funtime Adventure and the whole game was you taking a Kodak camera

410
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:24,520
and baiting women with jello pudding and new coke and hitting women in the head

411
00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:25,920
and putting them in your cave.

412
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:29,920
Well, I guess I suppose that's age

413
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:34,520
kind of poorly. I don't know if it's aged poorly or very well.

414
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:38,720
Well, depends on it. I mean, I don't think that's admissible as evidence in

415
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:40,880
court. What if it is?

416
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:46,680
Oh, you think Bill Cosby made the game? What if Bill Cosby made the game as a

417
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:51,220
confession as a confession. You keep it in so I mean serial killers do that.

418
00:25:51,220 --> 00:25:54,840
They make games. I mean a lot of probably a lot of these games were made

419
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:58,600
by serial killers who are admitting. I mean how do the people who make mortal

420
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:01,960
combat know what the inside of a guy looks like and also how do they sleep at

421
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:06,360
night? Yeah, well, how do you you know it's crazy bastards. It actually ruins

422
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:09,000
their life. The people who work on mortal combat, they're all like yeah. I

423
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:12,480
have PTSD. I can't sleep because I because they make us watch like gore

424
00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:16,620
videos. Really, I have to watch like actual like anatomy videos to do the

425
00:26:16,620 --> 00:26:19,260
it's the same as people working for Facebook and having a

426
00:26:19,260 --> 00:26:24,720
manually. It's exactly that job. Oh my God, speaking of Facebook, my my

427
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:27,820
girlfriend was like looking at marketplace last night and then like

428
00:26:27,820 --> 00:26:31,800
closes out of the window. I saw it on like on her laptop. She was looking for

429
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:35,620
a new boyfriend. Yeah, no, but she closes out and then the first thing on

430
00:26:35,620 --> 00:26:41,280
her feet was a video to lions fucking. Oh, I would get that on instagram

431
00:26:41,320 --> 00:26:45,620
every day. I would send them to I would send them to patches. There was this one

432
00:26:45,620 --> 00:26:48,560
instagram page. It was called like beautiful Africa or something like that

433
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:53,020
on every other post. Every other post was either was lions fucking and like the

434
00:26:53,020 --> 00:26:57,760
caption was like, oh, he likes it, but then there's also a bunch of like

435
00:26:57,760 --> 00:27:01,900
elephants pooping on each other's heads and like animals peeing in their mouths

436
00:27:01,900 --> 00:27:05,340
and stuff. Most of the time, every half of the posts are like a beautiful

437
00:27:05,340 --> 00:27:08,840
picture of like the landscape and like a herd of zebras and then you're one and

438
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:12,520
trying to be a full lines, Dickin Balls, yeah, but she kept trying to play it. I

439
00:27:12,520 --> 00:27:18,660
and immediately like somebody must have shared it or something or it like

440
00:27:18,660 --> 00:27:21,680
showed up on her feet or whatever, but she looked at it, then looked at me and

441
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:25,960
went like what I hate Facebook, because it's always crap like this.

442
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:27,200
That's like a

443
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:32,400
scrolling through. It's just like Lion, Lion,

444
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:35,240
what the fuck is that?

445
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:41,100
the worst part about an out of here, the worst part about animals at their shaft

446
00:27:41,100 --> 00:27:44,340
is hairy yeah yeah that ain't right. No, because they the

447
00:27:44,340 --> 00:27:50,680
oh yeah, because then then the red thing comes the page is called Wow Africa

448
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:55,040
on Instagram Wow Africa, W.

Jim Carrey came out of there. I sent so many. I can find them all because I

455
00:28:18,540 --> 00:28:23,080
sent them all to patches. Yeah, here's monkeys going at it. That was a picture

456
00:28:23,080 --> 00:28:25,560
of Tom and Jerry. Look at this one. I don't even know.

457
00:28:25,560 --> 00:28:32,160
Some kind of animal being born and the sack is attached. Here's rhinos fucking.

458
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,160
I saw two beetles having sex the other day.

459
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:36,360
- Whoa. - You get a pic?

460
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:38,640
- Congratulations. - No, no, I interrupted them.

461
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:39,480
I didn't realize.

462
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:42,720
I was walking on a, I was going on a hike upstate.

463
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:44,160
I'm walking down the trail,

464
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:47,120
and about a foot away from me, I see a giant beetle.

465
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:48,880
I go, "Holy shit, it's a giant beetle."

466
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:49,720
- How big?

467
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:52,240
- I mean, it was probably four or five feet wide.

468
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:55,640
And then I was like, I get a little closer,

469
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:58,080
and then I realize it's two beetles,

470
00:28:58,080 --> 00:28:59,240
and they were having intercourse,

471
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:00,600
and they split like this.

472
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:02,400
So I broke up some kind of fuck session.

473
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:05,440
they break it up. Yeah, I break it up. Good. Come on. What are you doing out

474
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:05,760
here?

475
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:07,680
Yeah,

476
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:09,480
come on.

477
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:14,060
I would love to be a somebody who has a pet beetle feel. Yeah, beetle. I

478
00:29:14,060 --> 00:29:17,400
think a beetle is the only, but I hate bugs. I do not like bugs. They gross

479
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:20,160
me out for whatever reason. A beetle does not gross me out. I would have a

480
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:23,280
beetle on a beetle is basically a mouse. Yeah, yeah, it's got that. You know

481
00:29:23,280 --> 00:29:27,080
what it is? It's got that sheen. It's also it's solid. Yeah, a lot of other

482
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:30,900
bugs are have like are very wiggly and they're slow. They go like for the most

483
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:34,160
they go like they're all different parts of them going different angles, but a

484
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:38,100
beetle is just like I don't like speed a rock. I do not want to have some beetles

485
00:29:38,100 --> 00:29:42,680
are fast, but a lot of them are the big ones are really big ones yeah, but it's

486
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:48,260
weird. It's also scary when a bug is heavy yeah in my head right now. That is

487
00:29:48,260 --> 00:29:52,720
better to me than a big yeah and a big one that's light. I'm only picturing a

488
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:56,400
like a moth over right now. I don't like moss. I don't like butterflies. You see

489
00:29:56,420 --> 00:30:00,900
those giant moths, you like butterflies, no, you don't like butterflies. I don't

490
00:30:00,900 --> 00:30:04,260
like butterflies. I hate dragon flies. I'm scared of dragon. I have a dragon

491
00:30:04,260 --> 00:30:07,780
yeah. My brother used to torture me by he would find dead dragon and show them

492
00:30:07,780 --> 00:30:11,320
in my room. No, and they'd scare me because I thought they were nice to

493
00:30:11,320 --> 00:30:15,460
come like that. Dragon flies bugs. I didn't I hated them. I thought I was

494
00:30:15,460 --> 00:30:19,060
running. Why is it cool? I think they're disgusting. There's too big. I used to

495
00:30:19,060 --> 00:30:23,140
try to get them to land on me weird. Oh yeah, you do that like yeah, you put the

496
00:30:23,180 --> 00:30:26,240
finger out like yeah. They think you're that's why they never did. They never

497
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:28,540
landed on me because I was doing this yeah. See that's a

498
00:30:28,540 --> 00:30:33,140
dragon fly. I thought that was a shoot up buddy. Hey land on this finger. You

499
00:30:33,140 --> 00:30:36,740
dragon flies are beautiful, fat ass cream. If it landed on that finger, I

500
00:30:36,740 --> 00:30:40,680
actually would that's what I'm saying. Their eyes are going different

501
00:30:40,680 --> 00:30:46,580
directions. Oh, that's crazy to me. I don't care too much about bugs. I hate

502
00:30:46,580 --> 00:30:50,600
bug. I there I definitely I feel like I have an okay tolerance for bugs, but I

503
00:30:50,660 --> 00:30:54,360
also I'm not going to pretend I'm not if I see a spider or a scary bug, I'm

504
00:30:54,360 --> 00:30:58,600
going to be scared of I used to have to I said babysit these kids at a bearded

505
00:30:58,600 --> 00:31:02,900
dragon. I used to have to feed it cockroaches, just feed it worms. That's

506
00:31:02,900 --> 00:31:04,300
what I think doesn't it live

507
00:31:04,300 --> 00:31:09,860
I had to put three live cockroaches in its thing. Every that is crazy. It was

508
00:31:09,860 --> 00:31:11,260
so disc. My and

509
00:31:11,260 --> 00:31:17,320
fifth no third or fifth grade. I can't remember we had crayfish to do the

510
00:31:17,380 --> 00:31:22,380
Crayfish unit. No. We took care of crayfish. Like we each had a yeah.

511
00:31:22,380 --> 00:31:26,380
Crawdads. Yeah, but we call them crayfish in the Northeast. We did not do that.

512
00:31:26,380 --> 00:31:30,380
Y'all are cray. Y'all are some cray ass fish. I've called them crawdads forever.

513
00:31:30,380 --> 00:31:36,380
Crawfish. You're performative. You are being performative.

514
00:31:36,380 --> 00:31:40,380
I actually call them crawdads forever. And he has the camo on. Yeah. Okay, nice try buddy.

515
00:31:40,380 --> 00:31:44,380
Cringe. Yeah, it's not getting through me today. But we would keep, like everyone had their own pet

516
00:31:44,380 --> 00:31:47,260
a crayfish that we would always take care of like it was like the like

517
00:31:47,260 --> 00:31:50,620
butterfly type unit, you know, but it was crayfish. I don't know why we did

518
00:31:50,620 --> 00:31:51,820
that. I don't know if that's that's a

519
00:31:51,820 --> 00:31:53,020
thing or

520
00:31:53,020 --> 00:31:57,780
really funded school, but I remember it really vividly that one kid, the

521
00:31:57,780 --> 00:31:59,240
crayfish got away and it like

522
00:31:59,240 --> 00:32:04,180
like everyone's cream, they got on the floor and it was zip just under the

523
00:32:04,180 --> 00:32:07,500
door into the next class. It's a walk in my God,

524
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:10,260
it's one of the I was like

525
00:32:10,940 --> 00:32:15,400
literally a walk in talking shrimp. Yeah, it's so it was so funny. It makes it

526
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:16,020
like

527
00:32:16,020 --> 00:32:21,460
when it shoots its tail real fast. Awesome. They're disgusting man, but I

528
00:32:21,460 --> 00:32:26,300
do like eating them. Yeah, speaking of eating bugs, I fucking saw my girlfriend

529
00:32:26,300 --> 00:32:29,060
pick up the cat and make it swing at a fly.

530
00:32:29,060 --> 00:32:34,660
She wanted to make sure I don't let him eat the bug. A fly is fine. Yeah, fuck

531
00:32:34,660 --> 00:32:38,940
that. She was standing there. I saw her in the kitchen, holding him on to the

532
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:43,200
because you wanted to eat the fly. I wanted to eat the fucking thing. I was

533
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:45,760
I was on my lily pad all day. I

534
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:50,040
would not surprise me. It would surprise me a little bit, but I mean,

535
00:32:50,040 --> 00:32:54,260
obviously a little bit, but not as much as with him. I guess if I was sitting

536
00:32:54,260 --> 00:32:57,560
here in a fly, like landed on my eye, like it was the camera and you went,

537
00:32:57,560 --> 00:33:00,820
your tongue came all the way out and grabbed the fly off my eye. Yeah, I

538
00:33:00,820 --> 00:33:04,960
would not. I would I would be got a totally quality. There's something

539
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:09,400
frogly about you. Yeah, you're frogly. Yeah, probably because I

540
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:10,700
just

541
00:33:10,700 --> 00:33:17,000
yeah, you are green right now. I guess and you also right now with your arms.

542
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,600
You kind of are having a frog like posture. You're kind of sinking your

543
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:22,500
head into your body. Well, you just riveted. I mean,

544
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:31,100
that alone makes you almost I want I've dude. I want to rib it so bad.

545
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:35,400
I want to have it and I want to be able to blow my cheeks up like a bullfrog

546
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:38,640
does. Did you guys have cat tails? Yeah,

547
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:44,440
the plant yeah yeah, I used to want to eat those me too, so bad. I thought that

548
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:48,820
it was a corn dog. Yeah, it looks exactly how fucked up is it that God

549
00:33:48,820 --> 00:33:51,920
made as it makes a plant that looks exactly it looks exactly like a corn

550
00:33:51,920 --> 00:33:56,040
dog. Yeah, well, I think I guess that we made the corn dog to look like a

551
00:33:56,040 --> 00:33:56,640
cat tail.

552
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:58,520
Shut the fuck up,

553
00:33:58,520 --> 00:33:59,920
shut up,

554
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:05,060
shut the foot right now. It was some for the prankster who invented the corn

555
00:34:05,060 --> 00:34:08,700
dogs. I'm going to make it look exactly like a cat tail. That's just not right

556
00:34:08,700 --> 00:34:11,620
dude and then you put and I put one in my mouth one time and it turns into

557
00:34:11,620 --> 00:34:13,420
basically yeah, it goes yeah.

558
00:34:13,420 --> 00:34:19,660
Is that the seed itself? Does that grow into something bigger? I think it grows

559
00:34:19,660 --> 00:34:21,060
into another cat tail my friend.

560
00:34:21,060 --> 00:34:24,300
Wow, it goes in it turns into a Christmas tree.

561
00:34:24,300 --> 00:34:29,360
The Christmas tree seed wow, but I just don't I don't think that's right, but

562
00:34:29,380 --> 00:34:33,520
there should be no food that looks like other looks like a plant. I don't think

563
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:38,340
that's right now, unless it's like a snowflake cookie or like a snow is not a

564
00:34:38,340 --> 00:34:38,820
plant

565
00:34:38,820 --> 00:34:44,700
for the last time. How many times have I to tell you that a snowflake is not a

566
00:34:44,700 --> 00:34:49,120
snow. People eat snowflakes all the time. You catch it out of the air. People do

567
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:53,320
it. It's a movie thing. It's so common that they made it a movie trope. No,

568
00:34:53,320 --> 00:34:58,580
like a snowflake plant, like the one the one that looks white as snow and it

569
00:34:59,220 --> 00:35:02,480
looks like still think of a Christmas tree with snow on it. Am I thinking of a

570
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:03,520
Christmas tree with no

571
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:08,040
yeah with snow yeah with snow or you think of a paper snowflake because that's

572
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:12,340
not a plan either. People hang those up on a string. Actually, I beg to differ

573
00:35:12,340 --> 00:35:15,580
yeah. What are you talking? It's made out of wood. It's made out of

574
00:35:15,580 --> 00:35:24,780
which is made out of what Cameron wood, which is from what bread bread? No, not

575
00:35:24,780 --> 00:35:28,460
from bread, dog and brain, not from bread. No, not from bread dog, not from

576
00:35:28,500 --> 00:35:29,300
Bread dog

577
00:35:29,300 --> 00:35:31,600
now dog

578
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:35,900
not from bread dog

579
00:35:35,900 --> 00:35:41,600
bread dog bread dog could be cool looking dog

580
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:47,700
dog made out of red doing. I don't even know what he's bread. This this you

581
00:35:47,700 --> 00:35:51,000
brought everything to a halt with bread dog. Yeah, yeah, I'm actually I'm

582
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:55,600
walking out. I'm protesting the podcast because you said bread dog. You said you

583
00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:59,540
I'm ready to go on that. I'm coming in with this heat dude. The cat tails look

584
00:35:59,540 --> 00:36:04,160
like hot or corn dogs, the night of the museum at the wax museum. We should get

585
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:07,560
corn dogs for lunch. We should order some on Uber. That would be amazing.

586
00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:11,560
There is a corn dog spot by my old apartment. Yeah, I know that. Oh yeah,

587
00:36:11,560 --> 00:36:17,120
the one on Knickerbocker, Korea, you've done it again. Yeah, Korea, you crazy

588
00:36:17,120 --> 00:36:22,360
mother fucker. You crazy fuckers. You took a corn dog, one of the worst things

589
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:27,440
What are you? Well, hold on, hold the phone. I'm never in the mood for a corn dog. Then

590
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:30,440
why do you care about cattails? You're never in the mood for a corn dog. When I was a kid

591
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:34,880
I liked them. What about at the carnival? At the carnival I'm getting funnel cake and

592
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:41,020
that's it. El does not have carnival smarts. A corn dog is so delicious once a year. Yeah.

593
00:36:41,020 --> 00:36:44,160
I haven't had a corn dog in many years. I had one. Well, actually I had a Korean corn

594
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:48,400
dog probably two years ago, but the sweet potato on it, the powdered sugar, this is

595
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:56,040
I had a really bad corn dog at that street fair thing. I'm sorry. It was really expensive,

596
00:36:56,040 --> 00:37:01,920
too. That's just about the worst street food you can get nowadays. There's so many better

597
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:08,160
options. Guess how much this corn dog was? Five bucks. Seven. More than seven dollars

598
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:12,920
for a fucking burrito? How big was it? Eight dollars, normal corn dog. Are you fucking

599
00:37:12,920 --> 00:37:17,280
for real? They already were handing it to me. They had made it and were handing it to

600
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:20,860
they're like okay, eight dollars and I was like you got bullied yeah, I got

601
00:37:20,860 --> 00:37:23,760
completely fucked God damn. It was so horrible. I'm

602
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:29,900
sad. What am I going to do now? Walk away, throw it in their face. I had the

603
00:37:29,900 --> 00:37:33,340
spirit of the street fair. Yeah, that's true. I mean when you're in a fair when

604
00:37:33,340 --> 00:37:33,960
you're in a fair

605
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:39,120
and eight dollars is like six dollars anything good. I mean that's yeah

606
00:37:39,120 --> 00:37:42,220
expensive for a corner. It's a three buck completely insane. Yeah, it should

607
00:37:42,220 --> 00:37:45,620
be less than three bucks. Yeah, yeah, great, unless it has all the trimmings

608
00:37:46,380 --> 00:37:49,620
completely absurd. The whole thing is trimming. That's what a hot dog is. What

609
00:37:49,620 --> 00:37:55,120
the hot dog is like? No, like feet like like the sweet potato, like sweet

610
00:37:55,120 --> 00:37:59,500
potatoes and the sneezing and is it true that eating a hot dog is the same? It

611
00:37:59,500 --> 00:38:02,500
like takes the same amount of time off your life as like a pack of cigarettes.

612
00:38:02,500 --> 00:38:06,700
I would imagine I would imagine that that's true about most food. Yeah,

613
00:38:06,700 --> 00:38:10,620
yeah, anything that goes through a process. I don't think that a lot of

614
00:38:10,620 --> 00:38:13,540
food is so healthy for you or in a hot. I feel like it's one of those things

615
00:38:13,540 --> 00:38:17,260
sure it's probably not completely true, but it might as well be. I try most of

616
00:38:17,260 --> 00:38:20,460
the other stuff you eat is probably going to do that anyway. Yeah, I think

617
00:38:20,460 --> 00:38:24,140
hot dogs are probably I think I do think that per pound they're just about the

618
00:38:24,140 --> 00:38:27,820
worst for you thing that you can eat. Why can't it ever in a hot dog in a long

619
00:38:27,820 --> 00:38:32,180
time? That's that corn dog. Why can't it ever be the stuff that I don't want to

620
00:38:32,180 --> 00:38:38,580
eat like my veggies, fruits that are bad for you? So why can't the only reason

621
00:38:38,580 --> 00:38:41,620
that the only reason that you don't like veggies is because they're good for you.

622
00:38:42,300 --> 00:38:44,500
I like veggies. I'm addicted to broccoli.

623
00:38:44,500 --> 00:38:45,900
That means veggies are bad for you.

624
00:38:45,900 --> 00:38:47,300
I did. I had a broccoli.

625
00:38:47,300 --> 00:38:48,300
I like broccoli a lot.

626
00:38:48,300 --> 00:38:49,700
Just broccoli with nothing else.

627
00:38:49,700 --> 00:38:51,700
Have you guys noticed that women don't like broccoli?

628
00:38:51,700 --> 00:38:52,700
Women like broccoli.

629
00:38:52,700 --> 00:38:53,700
Women like broccoli a lot.

630
00:38:53,700 --> 00:38:54,700
I haven't noticed this either.

631
00:38:54,700 --> 00:38:55,700
The women in my life.

632
00:38:55,700 --> 00:38:59,100
Women, no, women in my life do not like broccoli.

633
00:38:59,100 --> 00:39:02,600
Two different women don't like broccoli.

634
00:39:02,600 --> 00:39:04,100
You're saying this is a coincidence.

635
00:39:04,100 --> 00:39:05,600
That is just a coincidence, yeah.

636
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:07,100
Well, fuck me then.

637
00:39:07,100 --> 00:39:09,000
I guess I'm not making any sense.

638
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:09,600
No.

639
00:39:09,600 --> 00:39:13,380
but basically I know two women that do not like broccoli and to me broccoli is

640
00:39:13,380 --> 00:39:15,400
just about the most palatable vegetable on earth.

641
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:20,900
Yeah, I think that is the that's the number one broccoli. It's fibrous

642
00:39:20,900 --> 00:39:26,540
cinnamon broccoli vegetable. I couldn't set it better myself. It's fibrous. It's

643
00:39:26,540 --> 00:39:30,220
got all the vitamins you could ever ask for. Okay, they got different types of

644
00:39:30,220 --> 00:39:31,000
what's going to do.

645
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:33,360
What's it's just a vitamin. I don't know.

646
00:39:35,120 --> 00:39:38,720
way before my spinach heavily, heavily involved heavily

647
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:46,080
never heard of it. I thought it only went up to D. No, I know I know about

648
00:39:46,080 --> 00:39:50,000
E. Now there's a K. There's a vitamin K. Does it go everywhere through up to? I

649
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:55,480
don't think there's a vitamin Zed. Z is basically just zinc. Well, that's not a

650
00:39:55,480 --> 00:39:58,840
vitamin, though. That's a mineral. That's how they I guess it's just how they

651
00:39:58,840 --> 00:39:59,380
brand.

652
00:39:59,380 --> 00:40:02,200
What's it called AstraZeneca

653
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:06,080
all of it. You get every vitamin from A to Zinc.

654
00:40:06,080 --> 00:40:11,560
Oh, okay. Yeah. I get it. Yeah. So for a long time, I thought vitamin Z was Zinc.

655
00:40:11,560 --> 00:40:17,600
My aunt, my aunt had, she ate too much spinach and she had a vitamin K attack.

656
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:20,760
An overdose? She had to go to the hospital. Oh, a lot of vitamin overdoses

657
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:24,760
are really painful, right? Some of them are. She was in some of the greatest

658
00:40:24,760 --> 00:40:27,400
pain you could ever imagine. Yeah. That's insane. Which vitamin? There's some

659
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:31,160
vitamin. Vitamin K. Yeah. Vitamin B sometimes... Maybe that's what the K is,

660
00:40:31,160 --> 00:40:36,280
Vitamin K. I think is a dangerous vitamin to be having. There's another one that I was

661
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:41,280
seeing that I think that you can overdose on. Probably vitamin C. Cocaine. Maybe so.

662
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:46,280
If you have too many oranges. Yeah. What is it? It's keratin. If you eat too much, too

663
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:49,280
many carrots, your fucking skin turns all orange. Keratin is what your fingernails are

664
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:53,280
made out of. That happened to me. Yeah. I think I've told you this before. I think it's

665
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:57,280
a good thing. I think it's a good thing. I think it's a good thing. I think it's a good

666
00:40:57,280 --> 00:40:58,280
what your fingernails are made out of.

667
00:40:58,280 --> 00:40:59,280
That happened to me.

668
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:03,280
That, yeah. I think I've told you this before. I turned orange for one year.

669
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:04,280
Oh yeah.

670
00:41:04,280 --> 00:41:05,280
When I was like 15, when I was vegan.

671
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:06,280
You said that very recently.

672
00:41:06,280 --> 00:41:09,780
When I lost a bunch of weight when I was vegan, it was because I just filled myself up with

673
00:41:09,780 --> 00:41:10,780
carrots all day.

674
00:41:10,780 --> 00:41:13,280
If you eat too much chocolate, it turns your hands and mouth brown.

675
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:16,280
I, that is, I've noticed that.

676
00:41:16,280 --> 00:41:19,280
I think, I don't know if it's a vitamin thing or not, but it's happened to me a few times.

677
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:20,280
Especially on a hot day.

678
00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:21,280
Yeah.

679
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:22,280
You get a brown mouth.

680
00:41:22,280 --> 00:41:23,280
Yeah.

681
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:24,280
And your hands get brown as well.

682
00:41:24,280 --> 00:41:28,040
too many Jolly Ranchers, it can turn any color in your mouth. Yeah, turns your

683
00:41:28,040 --> 00:41:32,920
tongue a different color. Yeah, and lollipops and if you eat too much

684
00:41:32,920 --> 00:41:37,960
spaghetti, you're the ring around your mouth gets a red. I have been having

685
00:41:37,960 --> 00:41:41,120
there's been too much spaghetti or you play too much Call of Duty in middle

686
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:45,240
school. You get a red ring around your mouth. I've been having a personal

687
00:41:45,240 --> 00:41:50,480
epidemic of walking around with food, just food on your food, lipstick all the

688
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:52,800
time, and I don't even think to check before I leave the house and then I

689
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:56,400
I realized I walked around outside for hours and then came back and I had food

690
00:41:56,400 --> 00:42:00,080
all over my face. Damn. And I was also look, I was winking at everybody.

691
00:42:00,080 --> 00:42:04,160
You're winking? I'm a winker. Yeah, not a winker. I wink at everybody. You just

692
00:42:04,160 --> 00:42:07,480
couldn't wink just now. He walks around like Spider-Man three. He's walking

693
00:42:07,480 --> 00:42:10,440
around just going... Yeah, that is kind of how I walk around. Yeah.

694
00:42:10,440 --> 00:42:14,880
You do that. I do see you. I do see you across the street sometimes and I

695
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:19,160
don't say hi because I don't think that... It's 'cause I got my pinstripes on.

696
00:42:19,160 --> 00:42:22,920
you're in your seersucker suit. Yeah, leave me the fuck alone. You're in your

697
00:42:22,920 --> 00:42:25,760
trilby hat. You're walking down the street. I'm in my summer suit. Uh-huh

698
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:29,960
walking around, winking at the girlies. Yeah, I think people should. I think

699
00:42:29,960 --> 00:42:33,160
most people should have a flag popping out of my hat. I think most people

700
00:42:33,160 --> 00:42:37,160
should have an arc like like Spider-Man does in Spider-Man three where they

701
00:42:37,160 --> 00:42:44,160
find evil clothes and they turn evil. I agree. I agree. Yeah, which is

702
00:42:44,200 --> 00:42:47,320
with their normal clothes. I agree, oh yeah, which is

703
00:42:47,320 --> 00:42:52,280
that is basically what venom is is an evil sure he's his clothes that he

704
00:42:52,280 --> 00:42:55,840
threw away that got mad. Evil shirts should yeah that should be a more

705
00:42:55,840 --> 00:42:59,440
common trope yeah. The next venom movie should just be an evil. It should just

706
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:04,240
be a stinky old shirt shirt that was evil, a shirt with a face, the movie,

707
00:43:04,240 --> 00:43:08,160
the shirt with a face, oh my God, and the shirt can talk like one of those

708
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:13,760
in the mountain t shirts that like is just a picture of like an apes face and

709
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:18,100
your shirt can talk. I have a shirt that is a picture. If these sure to talk, I'm

710
00:43:18,100 --> 00:43:21,000
not sure that is a picture on it. Wait, you're wearing one right now.

711
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:27,020
Wait, I think it is a more picture. I have more. It has more picture than mine.

712
00:43:27,020 --> 00:43:29,760
Yeah, you know what? The scariest thing about this shirt is you don't know if

713
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:31,800
there's a person lurking behind all these leaves.

714
00:43:31,800 --> 00:43:37,680
I do. This is not real leaves. I'm not an idiot. You sure about that?

715
00:43:37,680 --> 00:43:41,960
Me and our shirts versus your shirt,

716
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:44,280
our shirts would win.

717
00:43:44,280 --> 00:43:45,280
Like if you personify them?

718
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:46,280
If the shirts became alive, yeah.

719
00:43:46,280 --> 00:43:47,280
So you admit that a skater is a loser?

720
00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:48,280
No, because that's a text.

721
00:43:48,280 --> 00:43:49,280
So you admit that skaters would lose any fight?

722
00:43:49,280 --> 00:43:50,280
No.

723
00:43:50,280 --> 00:43:51,280
Because, okay, here's my beef with skaters, man.

724
00:43:51,280 --> 00:43:52,280
It's never a fair fight.

725
00:43:52,280 --> 00:43:53,280
Why?

726
00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:54,280
Skaters don't fight fair.

727
00:43:54,280 --> 00:43:55,280
They have a weapon.

728
00:43:55,280 --> 00:43:56,280
They walk around on a weapon all day.

729
00:43:56,280 --> 00:43:57,280
They do a truck smash.

730
00:43:57,280 --> 00:43:58,280
One on one.

731
00:43:58,280 --> 00:43:59,280
They do a truck slam, truck smash.

732
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:00,280
Truck smack.

733
00:44:00,280 --> 00:44:01,280
Is that what it's called?

734
00:44:01,280 --> 00:44:02,280
Uh-huh.

735
00:44:02,280 --> 00:44:03,280
Uh-huh.

736
00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:04,280
You can call it whatever you want.

737
00:44:04,280 --> 00:44:05,280
I don't know.

738
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:06,280
I don't know.

739
00:44:06,280 --> 00:44:07,280
I don't know.

740
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:08,280
I don't know.

741
00:44:08,280 --> 00:44:09,280
I don't know.

742
00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:10,280
Is that what it's called?

743
00:44:10,280 --> 00:44:11,280
Uh huh.

744
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:12,280
Uh huh.

745
00:44:12,280 --> 00:44:13,280
You can call it whatever you want.

746
00:44:13,280 --> 00:44:14,280
Hit with the truck.

747
00:44:14,280 --> 00:44:15,280
Truck slapper.

748
00:44:15,280 --> 00:44:20,760
That's, you can't walk around and, you can't ride a blade, I can't ride my blade all day.

749
00:44:20,760 --> 00:44:21,760
You could.

750
00:44:21,760 --> 00:44:22,760
No I can't.

751
00:44:22,760 --> 00:44:23,760
Roller blades.

752
00:44:23,760 --> 00:44:24,760
I can ride my blades.

753
00:44:24,760 --> 00:44:25,760
Yeah.

754
00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:26,760
But those are bad weapons.

755
00:44:26,760 --> 00:44:27,760
Roller blades.

756
00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:28,760
It takes a minute to take them off your feet.

757
00:44:28,760 --> 00:44:29,760
You know what you can do?

758
00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:30,760
Put a switchblade on the heel.

759
00:44:30,760 --> 00:44:31,760
But then I'm going to prison.

760
00:44:31,760 --> 00:44:34,480
You aren't going to prison for walking around with a skateboard.

761
00:44:34,480 --> 00:44:36,440
Well that's because it becomes a weapon in the heat of battle.

762
00:44:36,440 --> 00:44:38,560
As much as I think that you should.

763
00:44:38,560 --> 00:44:41,520
There's no heat of battle because somebody told you to get up. Hey, stop skating on my

764
00:44:41,520 --> 00:44:45,720
kids wheelchair. That's not a battle.

765
00:44:45,720 --> 00:44:47,520
It's a little bit of a battle.

766
00:44:47,520 --> 00:44:51,640
How's that a battle? No, there's no skater has ever all those videos where it's like

767
00:44:51,640 --> 00:44:53,480
epic truck smack. Those kids.

768
00:44:53,480 --> 00:44:57,840
There's no videos of truck smacks because that's an actual felony.

769
00:44:57,840 --> 00:44:59,640
There's a video. I know a video of a truck smack.

770
00:44:59,640 --> 00:45:00,880
You know a video of a truck smack?

771
00:45:00,880 --> 00:45:04,240
Yeah, although now that I think about it, I think the guy was being really racist and

772
00:45:04,240 --> 00:45:05,560
that's why he got truck smacked.

773
00:45:05,560 --> 00:45:10,200
I know the video. Yeah. Yeah. That one makes sense.

774
00:45:10,200 --> 00:45:15,600
But besides that, I haven't seen the only other time I've seen a video of

775
00:45:15,600 --> 00:45:18,840
somebody get truck smacked is the movie kids.

776
00:45:18,840 --> 00:45:23,640
I think that you're letting film sway your opinion.

777
00:45:23,640 --> 00:45:27,120
I don't give a fuck about Harmony Koren movies. You don't? No.

778
00:45:27,120 --> 00:45:30,520
I saw the spring breakers one and I thought that James Franco was doing an

779
00:45:30,520 --> 00:45:35,520
offensive caricature of riff raff. Yeah. So I turned it off.

780
00:45:35,520 --> 00:45:38,920
And I thought Selena Gomez was too skinny.

781
00:45:38,920 --> 00:45:40,920
So I said, I'm not watching this movie.

782
00:45:40,920 --> 00:45:43,920
I don't want to see this garbage.

783
00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:48,920
I think the movie he made directly after that was Trash Humpers.

784
00:45:48,920 --> 00:45:50,920
Old people.

785
00:45:50,920 --> 00:45:58,920
Can we stop making these movies that are about the lowly dregs of society?

786
00:45:58,920 --> 00:46:04,920
How come a guy like Harmony Corrine is allowed to make a movie

787
00:46:04,920 --> 00:46:09,820
movie called Trash Humpers. Yeah, and we only have six or seven transformers

788
00:46:09,820 --> 00:46:14,020
movies. The fuck is that? And I try to make a movie called The Bug Fucker

789
00:46:14,020 --> 00:46:18,600
and you should be completely boxed out of the world. I agree. There should be

790
00:46:18,600 --> 00:46:22,960
sent off world to a colony. There should be a colony of bug women. No, no, and

791
00:46:22,960 --> 00:46:26,480
they're going to literally, they're going to tear you limb from limb. That's

792
00:46:26,480 --> 00:46:30,780
exactly what the bug would not fuck you, my friend. You really scare it, and if

793
00:46:30,800 --> 00:46:35,120
if you fucked a bug, it would be against the bugs wishes. A bug would scurry

794
00:46:35,120 --> 00:46:40,480
bugs cannot consent. I don't know what yeah and you say you want to fuck one.

795
00:46:40,480 --> 00:46:41,560
No, I'm saying it was a

796
00:46:41,560 --> 00:46:46,200
change in his whole mind who can't consent a plant. That's your dream, a

797
00:46:46,200 --> 00:46:50,440
planet of bug women who cannot consent. It's not true. That's your dream. It's

798
00:46:50,440 --> 00:46:55,520
not my you made it up. I didn't make up a single word. I made up just now. Well,

799
00:46:55,520 --> 00:46:57,160
okay, but I wasn't involved

800
00:46:58,600 --> 00:47:03,360
whatever, unless there's royalties to be had. I was there's some royalty on the

801
00:47:03,360 --> 00:47:07,680
bug planet. Well, I'd like to be the Queen, but just in a platonic way, I just

802
00:47:07,680 --> 00:47:11,280
or a I would like to be christened. I think that

803
00:47:11,280 --> 00:47:15,040
doesn't it suck that now you got to be christened by a guy yeah

804
00:47:15,040 --> 00:47:17,840
kind of gay

805
00:47:17,840 --> 00:47:24,720
next time someone is going to become a night. Oh, because I did I understand

806
00:47:24,760 --> 00:47:30,320
yeah that you really isn't is put a champagne on a boat next. I really so

807
00:47:30,320 --> 00:47:32,760
you have to be knighted by a king yeah

808
00:47:32,760 --> 00:47:38,460
yeah he's got a touch. I'll fight for you yeah. I'll protect you. I'll protect

809
00:47:38,460 --> 00:47:42,100
you, because your highness, why does these people get knighted for being

810
00:47:42,100 --> 00:47:48,120
actors in the UK? Yeah, what's with that? How far have we fallen? Why is a we

811
00:47:48,120 --> 00:47:52,540
have to kill six thousand people in the Middle East, so he became a night, sir

812
00:47:52,960 --> 00:47:56,120
Pierce Brosnan, I guess that makes sense. He was James Bond. I guess if

813
00:47:56,120 --> 00:48:00,060
you're a James Bond, no immediate, he was not he pretended to be James Bond.

814
00:48:00,060 --> 00:48:02,360
The real James Bond should be nighted, not this.

815
00:48:02,360 --> 00:48:11,040
He is not James Bond, no, not even a little. He's a slob. He dressed as

816
00:48:11,040 --> 00:48:16,440
James Bond. Yeah, oh, I went for four or five movies. Who cares right? Yeah,

817
00:48:16,440 --> 00:48:22,060
okay, you see what I mean. I see I don't even think he's knighted Pierce

818
00:48:22,100 --> 00:48:24,520
thousand and I think I was just I think I'm thinking of somebody in the

819
00:48:24,520 --> 00:48:28,040
Kellen is yeah, but he was Gandalf and that's one of their biggest again.

820
00:48:28,040 --> 00:48:31,160
That's like they're not Gandalf. He pretended to be Gandalf and also that

821
00:48:31,160 --> 00:48:35,480
was New Zealand. Oh yeah, do you get knighted in New Zealand? What do they

822
00:48:35,480 --> 00:48:40,640
got down there? Not much. Yeah, I know they got some lambs not fucking

823
00:48:40,640 --> 00:48:44,240
order the rings tour Lord of the Rings and then that puzzle world. It's cool

824
00:48:44,240 --> 00:48:49,560
that that's like a puzzle world. Yeah, they got a whole they got a whole field

825
00:48:49,560 --> 00:48:51,180
that is just like a

826
00:48:51,180 --> 00:48:58,720
a bunch of statues that are like like a big chess piece, a checkers board.

827
00:48:58,720 --> 00:49:04,520
Those aren't puzzles room that is small as you walk towards it. Are you

828
00:49:04,520 --> 00:49:07,780
thinking of the Museum of Optical Illusions? You're saying no, there's

829
00:49:07,780 --> 00:49:13,620
there's like a upside down building, a big a little be field in New Zealand.

830
00:49:13,620 --> 00:49:19,620
It's basic. It's near the Hobbit holes and it's all their hobbles actually

831
00:49:19,660 --> 00:49:23,980
puzzles and other things. They are their holes. They're hovels. They're holes. I

832
00:49:23,980 --> 00:49:28,100
have to look that up because that's I had to do. I had to do a project on New

833
00:49:28,100 --> 00:49:31,500
Zealand in high school and you found a puzzle world. There is a possible during

834
00:49:31,500 --> 00:49:34,460
your investigation. There is a puzzle world. I think I was looking up

835
00:49:34,460 --> 00:49:41,820
New Zealand landmarks. There's a bunch of mountains or cliffs or basically just

836
00:49:41,820 --> 00:49:47,020
cliffs, not even mountains. Hobbit hole puzzle world. You know what? I don't mean

837
00:49:47,020 --> 00:49:50,940
is an insult, but I could never see you going to Europe.

838
00:49:50,940 --> 00:49:51,940
Yeah.

839
00:49:51,940 --> 00:49:54,180
I just don't think you'd fit in.

840
00:49:54,180 --> 00:49:55,620
I would not fit in at all.

841
00:49:55,620 --> 00:49:57,340
Imagine him walking around like Paris.

842
00:49:57,340 --> 00:49:58,340
Yeah.

843
00:49:58,340 --> 00:50:00,100
That'd be kind of tough to imagine.

844
00:50:00,100 --> 00:50:03,020
I don't even think I would want to go to Paris.

845
00:50:03,020 --> 00:50:04,020
It's disgusting.

846
00:50:04,020 --> 00:50:07,020
If you could go anywhere in the world, where would you go for a vacation?

847
00:50:07,020 --> 00:50:10,620
I'd probably go to Syria.

848
00:50:10,620 --> 00:50:11,620
I don't think you would.

849
00:50:11,620 --> 00:50:12,620
I don't think you would enjoy it.

850
00:50:12,620 --> 00:50:13,620
I don't think I would.

851
00:50:13,620 --> 00:50:14,620
So you don't have it?

852
00:50:14,620 --> 00:50:17,120
I didn't want to say Ireland because you knew that I would say it.

853
00:50:17,120 --> 00:50:18,020
Well, except for Ireland.

854
00:50:18,020 --> 00:50:18,820
Barring Ireland.

855
00:50:18,820 --> 00:50:20,620
Okay, so barring Ireland.

856
00:50:20,620 --> 00:50:24,520
Like what are the culturally interesting places in the world to you?

857
00:50:24,520 --> 00:50:26,620
Yes, Germany.

858
00:50:26,620 --> 00:50:28,020
Oh.

859
00:50:28,020 --> 00:50:29,020
Because I...

860
00:50:29,020 --> 00:50:30,220
Where in Germany?

861
00:50:30,220 --> 00:50:31,220
Bergheim.

862
00:50:31,220 --> 00:50:36,020
I want to go to the Scheisse room and see some crap.

863
00:50:36,020 --> 00:50:38,020
No, you don't.

864
00:50:38,020 --> 00:50:38,820
No, I don't.

865
00:50:38,820 --> 00:50:39,820
What am I saying?

866
00:50:39,820 --> 00:50:42,420
Me, I want to go to Italy.

867
00:50:42,420 --> 00:50:43,420
I want to go to Greece.

868
00:50:43,420 --> 00:50:46,420
I want to go to, but I don't want to have to travel through the country. So you

869
00:50:46,420 --> 00:50:47,720
have to go to China.

870
00:50:47,720 --> 00:50:51,220
Yeah, China would be cool. Maybe

871
00:50:51,220 --> 00:50:57,420
I would basically honestly, I want to go to every country in the world and I'm

872
00:50:57,420 --> 00:51:04,220
not even joking. I do. I do want to go to Europe for honeymoon vibes, but I am

873
00:51:04,220 --> 00:51:07,820
looking at how to get from Italy to Greece. Yeah, and you do have to go

874
00:51:07,820 --> 00:51:12,520
through every Balkan fucking country to get there, which does not sound that

875
00:51:12,520 --> 00:51:17,120
fun to me. Yeah, you don't think it would be fun to go to like I don't want to go

876
00:51:17,120 --> 00:51:18,420
to Serbia, bro.

877
00:51:18,420 --> 00:51:23,420
Albania. I don't want to do any of that. What about Czech Republic? They got a

878
00:51:23,420 --> 00:51:27,520
booming film industry there and you could probably make a movie while you're

879
00:51:27,520 --> 00:51:27,920
out there.

880
00:51:27,920 --> 00:51:33,720
Well, I do like movies. Yeah, but I why do they put the all the country? It

881
00:51:33,720 --> 00:51:37,820
should be like the US where all the cool stuff is on the East Coast or the West

882
00:51:37,820 --> 00:51:40,920
Coast and there's nothing in between. They should just you know what they

883
00:51:40,920 --> 00:51:47,220
should do is just make a United States of Balkan countries and like all of Europe.

884
00:51:47,220 --> 00:51:49,420
And then move the whole thing to Russia.

885
00:51:49,420 --> 00:51:50,920
Move the whole thing.

886
00:51:50,920 --> 00:51:53,420
Russia's way, way, way too big.

887
00:51:53,420 --> 00:51:53,920
Yeah.

888
00:51:53,920 --> 00:51:56,420
They need people in that eastern part of Russia.

889
00:51:56,420 --> 00:51:58,920
They have to split that place up.

890
00:51:58,920 --> 00:52:03,420
I think that's definitely a possibility for me if I flame out the United States.

891
00:52:03,420 --> 00:52:04,420
Splitting up Russia?

892
00:52:04,420 --> 00:52:05,420
Yeah, basically dividing it.

893
00:52:05,420 --> 00:52:06,420
Yeah.

894
00:52:06,420 --> 00:52:09,920
No, going and doing the homesteading act thing they have over there.

895
00:52:09,920 --> 00:52:13,920
where they give you like 50k and send you to Siberia. I would do that.

896
00:52:13,920 --> 00:52:15,920
You're going to have to do that in 50 years.

897
00:52:15,920 --> 00:52:16,920
That'd be fun.

898
00:52:16,920 --> 00:52:18,920
What is the only land left?

899
00:52:18,920 --> 00:52:22,920
Is Siberia actually like a barren wasteland?

900
00:52:22,920 --> 00:52:28,920
There's like nobody there. There's a couple of cities, but one of them is like the coldest city in the world.

901
00:52:28,920 --> 00:52:30,920
Oh yeah, one of them is permafrost.

902
00:52:30,920 --> 00:52:31,920
Oh Jesus.

903
00:52:31,920 --> 00:52:32,920
Yeah.

904
00:52:32,920 --> 00:52:33,920
How'd you live there?

905
00:52:33,920 --> 00:52:34,920
Jesus, permafrost.

906
00:52:34,920 --> 00:52:35,920
Oh Jesus.

907
00:52:35,920 --> 00:52:36,920
Oh Christ.

908
00:52:37,920 --> 00:52:43,180
a ton drop. I monsters there to Holy Yeti's actually the most beautiful

909
00:52:43,180 --> 00:52:46,460
women of all time there, but they're all they're all frozen solid on yeah

910
00:52:46,460 --> 00:52:51,040
there. It's probably it's probably why couple of ice queens up there in

911
00:52:51,040 --> 00:52:54,880
Siberia, a couple of them all breaking your heart only a couple. Well, there's

912
00:52:54,880 --> 00:52:58,940
only four or five people, so it's a really amazing rate. Yeah, beautiful

913
00:52:58,940 --> 00:53:03,520
women, but I think that I could do very well in a Mongolia type situation.

914
00:53:03,700 --> 00:53:10,200
Mongolia, Mongolia, I would do well in I think I think it would be amazing to

915
00:53:10,200 --> 00:53:15,800
travel to to travel to over to Tibet and maybe do a Mount Everest thing. Yeah, I

916
00:53:15,800 --> 00:53:20,000
think that I would write seven wonders. This is so I really would. I think I

917
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:23,800
would really like to live my life in kind in like rural China and be in a

918
00:53:23,800 --> 00:53:28,000
Chinese village, but I wouldn't want to be the white guy who moves to rural

919
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:33,100
China and get the one white guy in the tiny village. So I China you ladder. So I

920
00:53:33,100 --> 00:53:37,960
I think what I would maybe do is funnel some of my money into developing

921
00:53:37,960 --> 00:53:42,240
basically the program from the Avatar movie and I would go into a Chinese

922
00:53:42,240 --> 00:53:47,360
person's body to put you in over their body yeah and live in a village. So you

923
00:53:47,360 --> 00:53:50,600
want to grow a Chinese peasant in your floors, you know, or I could just take

924
00:53:50,600 --> 00:53:53,480
someone's body. Who's no we're not going to you can't take somebody's body.

925
00:53:53,480 --> 00:53:57,040
That's yeah, that's insane. I take my body, they'd be they'd love to take your

926
00:53:57,040 --> 00:54:00,120
body. Can I take your life in America to yeah? Yeah, what if it's just like a

927
00:54:00,160 --> 00:54:04,300
freaky Friday situation where you just switch your bodies out yeah. You just

928
00:54:04,300 --> 00:54:09,620
what you switch you body swap with like some like sixty five year old and then

929
00:54:09,620 --> 00:54:13,920
Chinese farmer and you're just a little younger. I mean maybe the same my same

930
00:54:13,920 --> 00:54:14,340
age.

931
00:54:14,340 --> 00:54:19,840
You want to do you want to do an exchange student situation? Yeah, what if they

932
00:54:19,840 --> 00:54:25,160
just what if everybody in China just wears glasses that show you as kind of

933
00:54:25,160 --> 00:54:26,240
blending in

934
00:54:28,040 --> 00:54:32,440
that would take a lot of convincing. I guess it just has to be my village.

935
00:54:32,440 --> 00:54:37,040
Yeah, that does it and I just don't leave my village. I think you become some

936
00:54:37,040 --> 00:54:37,480
kind of

937
00:54:37,480 --> 00:54:42,560
Lord too quickly. Yeah, I didn't want to say that, but yeah, yeah, I think that

938
00:54:42,560 --> 00:54:46,480
you just you have to I would completely be the Lord of a Chinese, you're too

939
00:54:46,480 --> 00:54:49,360
magnetic to do anything like that

940
00:54:49,360 --> 00:54:53,720
morally, because I think that pretty soon you'd be having

941
00:54:55,040 --> 00:54:59,580
people bringing you around on wagons and stuff, and I don't think that that'd be

942
00:54:59,580 --> 00:55:04,680
a good look for the podcast. Oh, you think we're doing the podcast? I hope so

943
00:55:04,680 --> 00:55:08,840
what am I supposed to do in this situation? Yeah, I guess I'm doing I

944
00:55:08,840 --> 00:55:10,580
guess you would be on a tour of Europe

945
00:55:10,580 --> 00:55:14,920
that I exchanged with well. I mean that'd be yeah, it'd be a new market. I

946
00:55:14,920 --> 00:55:15,360
guess

947
00:55:15,360 --> 00:55:22,920
do we would pop on webo? No, why not? I don't understand that crap. It's the

948
00:55:22,960 --> 00:55:26,160
name is everything else. It's just in a whole new language.

949
00:55:26,160 --> 00:55:29,520
Yeah, but that would, it would suck going on. Oh yeah, I guess I could get a translator,

950
00:55:29,520 --> 00:55:33,800
but it would suck going on there. You can choose AI. Not with the translator just going

951
00:55:33,800 --> 00:55:38,000
like, what the hell are y'all saying? It'd be fun to go promote it on all the podcast,

952
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:42,800
all the Chinese, Chinese, your mom's house, Chinese, the Oman. That would be incredible.

953
00:55:42,800 --> 00:55:47,720
Go and do all those shows. Chinese Bobby Lee. Yeah. Go do Tiger mom or whatever that show

954
00:55:47,720 --> 00:55:52,720
is called. Tiger belly. Tiger belly. Tiger belly over there. That'd be cool, man. Yeah,

955
00:55:52,720 --> 00:55:56,020
that would be pretty. I love to do that. We should do some. We should just do a

956
00:55:56,020 --> 00:56:01,420
we should just do that. Yeah, on every podcast in the world, we I want to

957
00:56:01,420 --> 00:56:07,240
become a promote insanely top level famous in a different country. Yeah, I

958
00:56:07,240 --> 00:56:09,400
think that we are and then be forced to move.

959
00:56:09,400 --> 00:56:15,500
Yeah, continue our life. Yeah, our like the fun, every like go we go there and

960
00:56:15,500 --> 00:56:17,540
we become the first people to do

961
00:56:19,880 --> 00:56:22,800
amazing next level alt comedy in the far east.

962
00:56:22,800 --> 00:56:30,280
We are missing out not auto translating every single episode with AI to different languages.

963
00:56:30,280 --> 00:56:32,440
That's what Mr. Beast does.

964
00:56:32,440 --> 00:56:33,680
Is that what he actually does?

965
00:56:33,680 --> 00:56:38,320
Well Mr. Beast has a channel for like 50 different languages translated.

966
00:56:38,320 --> 00:56:39,320
Why aren't we doing that?

967
00:56:39,320 --> 00:56:43,080
Because we don't have his kind of money man, he's the richest guy in the world.

968
00:56:43,080 --> 00:56:44,080
I mean...

969
00:56:44,080 --> 00:56:45,080
He's got more money than anybody.

970
00:56:45,080 --> 00:56:46,080
We could figure it out.

971
00:56:46,080 --> 00:56:48,600
This guy walks around in hands of homeless people with 10 million dollars.

972
00:56:48,600 --> 00:56:50,600
He doesn't even notice it.

973
00:56:50,600 --> 00:56:52,600
He doesn't even realize he's doing it.

974
00:56:52,600 --> 00:56:54,600
He accidentally built a squid game.

975
00:56:54,600 --> 00:56:56,600
He did?

976
00:56:56,600 --> 00:56:58,600
It was an accident.

977
00:56:58,600 --> 00:57:00,600
I thought it was on purpose.

978
00:57:00,600 --> 00:57:02,600
It was a clerical error.

979
00:57:02,600 --> 00:57:04,600
He was playing it off.

980
00:57:04,600 --> 00:57:06,600
He was like, "Fuck, I guess I'll make a fucking video now."

981
00:57:06,600 --> 00:57:08,600
He did that on accident.

982
00:57:08,600 --> 00:57:10,600
He didn't even realize it. He just ordered all this shit.

983
00:57:10,600 --> 00:57:12,600
He got a big statue that shoots a laser.

984
00:57:12,600 --> 00:57:14,600
That's crazy.

985
00:57:14,600 --> 00:57:16,600
It's fucking insane what he's doing.

986
00:57:16,600 --> 00:57:25,280
that. 90% of those videos. He's just walking around getting filmed. I mean no, he orders

987
00:57:25,280 --> 00:57:29,080
the stuff accidentally, he goes on a shopping spree on Amazon and then he's like, "Well,

988
00:57:29,080 --> 00:57:37,360
I guess I could do a squid game with this." Is he a teetotattler? He's not a tattletale.

989
00:57:37,360 --> 00:57:41,920
He's a teetotaller, is that how you say it? I've only seen that word written and never

990
00:57:41,920 --> 00:57:46,920
heard. I think he's a tea totaler. I can't imagine Jimmy drinking. Yeah. Yeah.

991
00:57:46,920 --> 00:57:51,720
Because I'm afraid of what Mr. Beast becomes when he drinks. Yeah, I know.

992
00:57:51,720 --> 00:57:56,820
You hear the name. He's been training and losing weight. You hear the name

993
00:57:56,820 --> 00:58:00,820
Mr. Beast and you think this guy must have gotten that nickname from pounding

994
00:58:00,820 --> 00:58:05,620
them back, pounding back Coors Light every night. Mr. Beast. I don't really

995
00:58:05,620 --> 00:58:10,120
think that. I think maybe he was like a feral animal. He was like kind of like

996
00:58:10,120 --> 00:58:14,720
skinny fat like chubby. But he did post something where he said that he was 40%

997
00:58:14,720 --> 00:58:20,220
body fat, which just can't be true. That is so fat. That is so much fatter than

998
00:58:20,220 --> 00:58:23,680
he was. I feel like maybe he was fat before he was on YouTube or something,

999
00:58:23,680 --> 00:58:26,700
or before he was famous. That could be true. I bet that's what it is. You know

1000
00:58:26,700 --> 00:58:31,080
that he's been grinding YouTube for like 15 years? Yeah, he made that video of him

1001
00:58:31,080 --> 00:58:34,120
saying every single word in the dictionary or something. Yeah, yeah, he

1002
00:58:34,120 --> 00:58:39,180
counted every single word, or not counted. No, he counted to one million. He

1003
00:58:39,180 --> 00:58:42,580
He counted to a million. And then he also, I think some, some podcasts,

1004
00:58:42,580 --> 00:58:45,180
I'm like, Hey, if you were going to make a video right now and you had nobody,

1005
00:58:45,180 --> 00:58:47,420
what would you do? And I think he said again, he was like,

1006
00:58:47,420 --> 00:58:49,340
I would count to 1 million. That's an amazing idea.

1007
00:58:49,340 --> 00:58:55,060
Like who will watch to this video? Yeah. Counting to a million.

1008
00:58:55,060 --> 00:59:00,260
I mean, I feel like that video is just him, like people just clicking on it.

1009
00:59:00,260 --> 00:59:02,340
That would take me so long. It'd be so fun.

1010
00:59:02,340 --> 00:59:05,780
It did you pull up the Mr. B's counting to 1 million video and it has the thing

1011
00:59:05,780 --> 00:59:09,440
and like over the like time bar where it shows like the most replayed and you

1012
00:59:09,440 --> 00:59:12,080
like click to see what the most replayed and he goes like a thousand

1013
00:59:12,080 --> 00:59:21,300
everyone going to find their favorite yeah yeah there. It is he said fifty

1014
00:59:21,300 --> 00:59:21,680
eight

1015
00:59:21,680 --> 00:59:27,520
that's my age. That's true. If yeah, if you're going to watch Mr. Beast, say

1016
00:59:27,520 --> 00:59:31,240
your your lucky number, there's probably pretty steep drop off after a hundred.

1017
00:59:31,280 --> 00:59:35,160
how many people are lucky numbers, my looking for seven thousand five

1018
00:59:35,160 --> 00:59:40,560
hundred and ninety six. I never see you. I see that number everywhere. Where do

1019
00:59:40,560 --> 00:59:44,080
people get these lucky numbers that they play in the lottery? Sometimes it's

1020
00:59:44,080 --> 00:59:48,280
grandma's birthday. Sometimes sometimes it's just a number that you feel is my

1021
00:59:48,280 --> 00:59:53,360
dad is a lucky number. What is it one like I'd say it publicly,

1022
00:59:53,360 --> 00:59:58,360
I'm not giving away the luck, not giving away the magic. I mean it has it

1023
00:59:58,400 --> 01:00:01,960
for him? Does he play the, has he ever won the lottery? He's never won the lottery, but

1024
01:00:01,960 --> 01:00:07,280
he he's still he's been using this lucky number for everything his whole life. But what is

1025
01:00:07,280 --> 01:00:12,340
there besides the lottery to use a lucky number for? Just anything where a number can be used.

1026
01:00:12,340 --> 01:00:17,800
What is another thing where you use a number? A password? Yeah, like phone number. You can't

1027
01:00:17,800 --> 01:00:20,800
choose your phone number. Yeah, you don't choose your phone number, but just like, you

1028
01:00:20,800 --> 01:00:25,280
know, just saying a number, pick a number. You can put your lucky number and you pick

1029
01:00:25,280 --> 01:00:28,780
like a six digit number. They want one and ten. It's not a six digit number.

1030
01:00:28,780 --> 01:00:33,100
This number is a five digit. It's a two digit number. You put your lucky number

1031
01:00:33,100 --> 01:00:37,040
in your password so that it logs. You make sure you log in every time. 69?

1032
01:00:37,040 --> 01:00:38,960
Wait, it says 69.

1033
01:00:38,960 --> 01:00:43,460
Was that close?

1034
01:00:43,460 --> 01:00:51,080
I'm never gonna tell you my dad's number. 23 Michael Jordan. No. 23 Lebron

1035
01:00:51,080 --> 01:00:53,060
James. No. 24 Kobe Bryant. No.

1036
01:00:54,360 --> 01:00:56,760
fucking what's another basketball player.

1037
01:00:56,760 --> 01:01:02,160
Forty-four already. Oh, no for I'm not even going to say yes. If you get it

1038
01:01:02,160 --> 01:01:06,260
forty-seven Andre Kalushnikov. No. Okay.

1039
01:01:06,260 --> 01:01:08,560
I'm not going to tell you

1040
01:01:08,560 --> 01:01:13,060
whatever do you're a bitch. No, I can't take. I'll tell you my lucky number

1041
01:01:13,060 --> 01:01:15,660
right now. Go ahead three. It's not three

1042
01:01:15,660 --> 01:01:17,160
- one

1043
01:01:17,160 --> 01:01:21,560
- three. So if you want to have a battle about it, we can't six six six.

1044
01:01:21,860 --> 01:01:25,260
That's the unluckiest number you can imagine. That's why you reclaim it.

1045
01:01:25,260 --> 01:01:31,520
You can't reclaim the 666. The devil has that on lock.

1046
01:01:31,520 --> 01:01:34,220
I bet that your dad's lucky number is like 13.

1047
01:01:34,220 --> 01:01:37,140
No. Come on.

1048
01:01:37,140 --> 01:01:39,620
Because it's ironically a lucky number.

1049
01:01:39,620 --> 01:01:41,820
People say lucky 13. It's not ironic.

1050
01:01:41,820 --> 01:01:46,500
That's a thing people say. People say that as an ironic thing because 13 is so unlucky.

1051
01:01:46,500 --> 01:01:47,540
52.

1052
01:01:47,540 --> 01:01:49,060
7 is a lucky number.

1053
01:01:49,060 --> 01:01:49,820
41.

1054
01:01:49,820 --> 01:01:50,840
14.

1055
01:01:51,460 --> 01:01:54,460
stop 15, 16, 17, 18,

1056
01:01:54,460 --> 01:01:56,560
22.

1057
01:01:56,560 --> 01:02:01,560
I can't jinx a lucky number for it's not jinxing. It is jinxing it. It's not

1058
01:02:01,560 --> 01:02:06,060
jinxing it to give away. If it were you just you guys, that's okay. So when the

1059
01:02:06,060 --> 01:02:09,760
camera, you have to keep in mind what's going on here, what we're doing right

1060
01:02:09,760 --> 01:02:12,960
now, this is not a safe place for me to share

1061
01:02:12,960 --> 01:02:18,960
to hundreds of thousands of people. I'll tell you my dad's lucky number. That's

1062
01:02:18,960 --> 01:02:21,820
really rude of you to do as I don't know what it is, but I'll text him and I'll

1063
01:02:21,820 --> 01:02:24,560
ask him see what it's like. Hey, what's your lucky number?

1064
01:02:24,560 --> 01:02:30,560
I haven't texted in six months. Hey, what is your lucky number?

1065
01:02:30,560 --> 01:02:35,460
That's not that bad to ask. That's what I'm saying. I don't think it's I think

1066
01:02:35,460 --> 01:02:39,960
you can get him a jersey. I'm just playing it safe or get like a hat for

1067
01:02:39,960 --> 01:02:42,760
him. It lives. What if I told you what if I said my dad's lucky number and he

1068
01:02:42,760 --> 01:02:47,060
died tomorrow? Well, I do think what if I don't say I think of us three, I think

1069
01:02:47,060 --> 01:02:54,660
easily the most superstitious one. You find synchronicities in almost everything.

1070
01:02:54,660 --> 01:02:56,340
I find all types of synchronicities. Patterns.

1071
01:02:56,340 --> 01:03:00,220
Patterns. When you told the story earlier about watching Ghost Hunters, I would not

1072
01:03:00,220 --> 01:03:05,660
have even thought of the betrayal that I was committing by watching that show.

1073
01:03:05,660 --> 01:03:06,660
It's Ghost Adventures.

1074
01:03:06,660 --> 01:03:08,660
See, I don't even know the name of it.

1075
01:03:08,660 --> 01:03:10,460
Ghost Hunters, Matt Schoolworth.

1076
01:03:10,460 --> 01:03:11,460
Oh really?

1077
01:03:11,460 --> 01:03:12,460
I don't even know if that's the show.

1078
01:03:12,460 --> 01:03:15,940
He said he knows them. Ghost Hunters was the first one on A&E.

1079
01:03:15,940 --> 01:03:18,440
I remember that show. So yeah, that's what I thought he was talking about.

1080
01:03:18,440 --> 01:03:21,000
See, I was I was so confused and

1081
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:24,000
uneducated. I wouldn't even know when I was betraying him,

1082
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:28,740
but you you were clear. You knew the betrayal and also as you were betraying

1083
01:03:28,740 --> 01:03:32,440
him, you knew that it was going to come back to bite you. I figured and then

1084
01:03:32,440 --> 01:03:35,840
when it did you were and you were looking for the bite. Also, yeah, the

1085
01:03:35,840 --> 01:03:40,140
bite you were you were on the hunt for a bite. Honestly, what I did not think

1086
01:03:40,140 --> 01:03:43,640
of the betrayal at all. And then I was not that I was just watching it and

1087
01:03:43,640 --> 01:03:47,540
and just my my complete honest reaction is I like was walking back to the trip

1088
01:03:47,540 --> 01:03:51,180
when I saw the screen and I saw the like KKK members of just my house. What the

1089
01:03:51,180 --> 01:03:51,720
hell

1090
01:03:51,720 --> 01:03:55,120
what the hell is this?

1091
01:03:55,120 --> 01:03:58,620
They change out loud,

1092
01:03:58,620 --> 01:04:02,320
it's like what the hell is this

1093
01:04:02,320 --> 01:04:08,600
jumping guy on the treadmill, hitting it at maximum speed and just running like

1094
01:04:08,600 --> 01:04:10,320
you never have before in your entire life.

1095
01:04:13,020 --> 01:04:17,220
yeah, but I did I did just fully of a what what is going on, but I didn't

1096
01:04:17,220 --> 01:04:21,180
think about it till afterwards. I think that every single machine at the gym

1097
01:04:21,180 --> 01:04:25,580
should have a TV on it. Yeah, most of the TVs don't work. There's one where it

1098
01:04:25,580 --> 01:04:26,060
works.

1099
01:04:26,060 --> 01:04:32,500
Thank you. Thank you. Let them know. Fix your damn TV. Fix your TV, man.

1100
01:04:32,500 --> 01:04:38,540
'Cause I go to the gym. You still go to that same gym. They play Impractical

1101
01:04:38,580 --> 01:04:44,180
Jokers. Yes. Yeah. And Practical Jokers friends and I will tell you that is the funniest show

1102
01:04:44,180 --> 01:04:47,140
I've ever seen in my life. In practical joke. I had never watched it before. I started going

1103
01:04:47,140 --> 01:04:52,860
to the gym here. That show is amazing. It is when they have been on that show for a

1104
01:04:52,860 --> 01:04:56,540
minute for a long time. When they make him work, when they make each other work at like

1105
01:04:56,540 --> 01:04:59,980
a Dunkin Donuts or whatever. It's funny. They have some really funny stuff in there. Tell

1106
01:04:59,980 --> 01:05:04,940
her you're going to kill yourself. He goes, I don't want to tell her that. That will be

1107
01:05:04,940 --> 01:05:09,940
That is amazing. Those guys have really done something special.

1108
01:05:09,940 --> 01:05:10,940
The Tenderloins.

1109
01:05:10,940 --> 01:05:11,940
That's a good idea for a show.

1110
01:05:11,940 --> 01:05:12,940
That's their name.

1111
01:05:12,940 --> 01:05:13,940
It's the best idea ever for a show.

1112
01:05:13,940 --> 01:05:14,940
They're a sketch troupe.

1113
01:05:14,940 --> 01:05:15,940
Really?

1114
01:05:15,940 --> 01:05:16,940
They're called the Tenderloins, yeah.

1115
01:05:16,940 --> 01:05:18,940
I didn't know that. I knew Sal was a stand-up.

1116
01:05:18,940 --> 01:05:22,940
When they go on that cruise, the cruise is them doing sketches.

1117
01:05:22,940 --> 01:05:25,940
Why are we not on the lineup for that cruise?

1118
01:05:25,940 --> 01:05:27,940
I have no idea why we aren't.

1119
01:05:27,940 --> 01:05:29,940
We should be on a cruise lineup.

1120
01:05:29,940 --> 01:05:36,700
I was talking to Eric the other day about us doing a Joy Tactics Potabelt list cruise.

1121
01:05:36,700 --> 01:05:37,700
On a canoe.

1122
01:05:37,700 --> 01:05:38,700
Not on a canoe.

1123
01:05:38,700 --> 01:05:39,700
We could fit more people on a canoe.

1124
01:05:39,700 --> 01:05:41,820
I think my uncle has a boat.

1125
01:05:41,820 --> 01:05:42,820
I mean we could get...

1126
01:05:42,820 --> 01:05:48,260
I don't know him that well, but also his boat is definitely not big enough to house all

1127
01:05:48,260 --> 01:05:49,260
of us.

1128
01:05:49,260 --> 01:05:50,260
We could get 100 people.

1129
01:05:50,260 --> 01:05:51,260
Not on that boat.

1130
01:05:51,260 --> 01:05:54,740
Not on that boat, but if we could get a boat that has 100 people and we could get everybody

1131
01:05:54,740 --> 01:05:57,740
eat something and we charge everybody $50,000, $40,000.

1132
01:05:57,740 --> 01:05:58,740
We could maybe eat something.

1133
01:05:58,740 --> 01:05:59,740
Yeah, that's how it would be.

1134
01:05:59,740 --> 01:06:04,140
just eat you eat you get on the boat on the boat, my corn dogs, hot dogs,

1135
01:06:04,140 --> 01:06:08,740
hamburgers, well the menu, just burger, basically every meal would be designed by

1136
01:06:08,740 --> 01:06:13,980
one. It's a six month cruise, yeah, yeah, we do the programming, it's a six month

1137
01:06:13,980 --> 01:06:19,060
cruise. How long are cruises? I mean, I think, depends on the cruise, yeah, yeah,

1138
01:06:19,060 --> 01:06:24,620
because I can't imagine being on a boat for like longer than a week and liking

1139
01:06:24,620 --> 01:06:27,580
it. Doesn't, might be ginants do a cruise? They do a cruise with the guy who did

1140
01:06:27,620 --> 01:06:34,100
still alive. John, no way. John, Jonathan, Jonathan, Colton, Colton, yeah, and

1141
01:06:34,100 --> 01:06:38,260
Paul and Storm. I don't know who that they all do a cruise. They do a big

1142
01:06:38,260 --> 01:06:42,940
cruise. 311 got a cruise with like did a cruise sugar ray and stuff and that

1143
01:06:42,940 --> 01:06:48,180
seems like the greatest cruise cruise. People die Natalie Holloway.

1144
01:06:48,180 --> 01:06:50,820
Often pretty often is that that's

1145
01:06:50,820 --> 01:06:55,220
who am I thinking of? Is that her Natalie Holloway? Your your even

1146
01:06:55,220 --> 01:06:59,100
Van der Sluyt or something killed her. He's in the news right now. What are you

1147
01:06:59,100 --> 01:07:03,200
talking about? Talking about that girl who got pushed off a cruise line or

1148
01:07:03,200 --> 01:07:05,900
something. I just saw the video of the kid who jumps off the cruise and just

1149
01:07:05,900 --> 01:07:10,620
dies instantly. Yeah, that's sad man. Yeah. Oh, I do. I keep I never watched

1150
01:07:10,620 --> 01:07:14,780
that one. I kept seeing it come up. I like why I don't want you to watch this.

1151
01:07:14,780 --> 01:07:19,300
What is this? I need to get this dirt off of my fucking screen man. Yeah, I

1152
01:07:19,300 --> 01:07:23,400
need to stop watching this HBO show. I need to stop watching the HBO show. What

1153
01:07:23,420 --> 01:07:28,000
happens in it. I've just been walking behind the couch while the girl watches. And I only

1154
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:31,580
get for whatever reason walk into the most disgusting, I think the whole show is probably

1155
01:07:31,580 --> 01:07:37,700
disgusting because I only, when I walk in it's all the weekend saying show me your fucking

1156
01:07:37,700 --> 01:07:43,380
stinky, show me your butt from the back with your stinkiness. Your butthole is green. Put

1157
01:07:43,380 --> 01:07:49,520
honey on your butt. It's this kind of stuff. Put honey on your butt. Put grape jelly on

1158
01:07:49,520 --> 01:07:53,320
on your but please plant green, please, please,

1159
01:07:53,320 --> 01:07:57,720
so I think

1160
01:07:57,720 --> 01:08:05,820
put honey on your but if HBO wanted to give such a Maren Cohen that money and

1161
01:08:05,820 --> 01:08:08,720
he did that show and it was bore at instead of the weekend, be the funniest

1162
01:08:08,720 --> 01:08:14,780
show for the all amazing bore at on your but yeah, that sounds funny right if

1163
01:08:14,780 --> 01:08:18,720
they were playing it for laughs and not not like oh, we're making people wet at

1164
01:08:18,740 --> 01:08:23,400
their house. Yeah, that's like you for you make my wife wet

1165
01:08:23,400 --> 01:08:28,540

1166
01:08:28,540 --> 01:08:33,540
I make the girl 18 this time and now he's like okay, and now

1167
01:08:33,540 --> 01:08:37,060
