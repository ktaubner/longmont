1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,320
"Last time on Gun City, the Temple of Tepenguin of Doom, our heroes went for drinks at the

2
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:18,440
popular Gadsville bar, the Gadfly, where they celebrated, along with friends Rex and Marie,

3
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:24,120
their victory in the arena, the Octagon, and their assurance to a no-hassle visitation

4
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:29,920
of the land caves, where they will find the next clue to discovering the Temple of Tepenguin

5
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:33,600
of doom in order to obtain the infamous N-word pass.

6
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:35,320
Make sure we got all of it.

7
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:40,800
Ray William Johnson robbed, unrobbed, and then sort of re-robbed the establishment, while

8
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:45,640
Patrick Yoda played hot scotch and vomited all over himself.

9
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:51,840
Lotus Piss absolutely crushed with a tight five that involved calling everyone frogs,

10
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:57,440
and later Marie gave them a strange amulet from Leo, a blank DVD with a string running

11
00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:03,360
through the center like a necklace. After a night of merriment our gang headed back to the that's

12
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:08,480
what she said inn where they locked the owner of the establishment inside of a supply closet

13
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:14,320
and slept in the arcade. Ray William Johnson explored his feminine side and the boys reignited

14
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:21,280
the once lauded profession of arcade repairman. The next day our heroes headed back to the gateway

15
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:30,120
Gad Cow, where they were let in with no issue by beautiful Simon, the Gads' attendant, who

16
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:34,160
led them straight into the Gad throne room in the hollowed out cow.

17
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:38,940
Despite deep suspicions, Baby Gad kept his word, and goo goo gah gahed his daddy into

18
00:01:38,940 --> 00:01:43,840
allowing the boys to have a one hour pass into the land caves.

19
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:47,760
Approaching the caves, Ray William Johnson almost killed Sullivan the Frog by throwing

20
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:50,640
him directly into a pile of deadly hissing wires.

21
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:54,640
where he immediately lost a lot of blood and passed out.

22
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:57,640
Thanks to a lucky roll, and because I am a generous DM,

23
00:01:57,640 --> 00:02:00,640
Sullivan does not remember this happening.

24
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:02,640
Patrick Yoda made quick work of the hissing snakes

25
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:04,640
with a clever use of his foreskin,

26
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:07,640
and the boys made it into the cave.

27
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:12,640
The cave entrance was filled with runes, a DDR pad, NES controller, an old PC...

28
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:15,640
I don't really want to talk about this part.

29
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:21,680
I'm still reeling a bit.

30
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:28,280
I feel like perhaps I've become less of a DM in the eyes of the listener.

31
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:33,400
I'll do everything in my power to win you back, and I'm sorry.

32
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:38,460
So now they're on a raft that looks like the ship from Mass Effect with a little gamer creature

33
00:02:38,460 --> 00:02:45,060
in tow, attempting to avoid what strange traps lie ahead left by the ancient Tamagotchi civilization

34
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:48,620
and vicious gamers alike.

35
00:02:48,620 --> 00:02:56,940
So yeah, you guys are inside of the Land Cave, where the gamers have sort of colonized this

36
00:02:56,940 --> 00:03:01,240
space that once belonged to the Tamagotchi civilization.

37
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:06,580
And you're on this raft that looks like the Mass Effect ship after something weird that

38
00:03:06,580 --> 00:03:09,820
Caleb did earlier in the game.

39
00:03:09,820 --> 00:03:16,520
And so now you're on this river of Mountain Dew.

40
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:20,560
You're on this raft in the sea of Mountain Dew, Baja Blast.

41
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:24,200
As you float casually down this cave, it's almost completely dark for most of the ride

42
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:26,880
and dead quiet, I called it.

43
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:32,880
You can hear the occasional Falmer noise that the gamers make, the "Hrrr" in the distance

44
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:37,440
and the sound of controllers being thrown against the walls.

45
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:40,120
And there's a lot of rolling going on.

46
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:42,040
So okay, cool.

47
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:43,600
You're Michael Dangerous now again.

48
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:46,100
I should not get distracted.

49
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:49,600
I have to not get distracted.

50
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:54,200
Yeah, so in Sound of Controllers being thrown against a wall,

51
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:57,600
you pass by a number of hovels and strange carvings on the walls,

52
00:03:57,600 --> 00:04:01,500
like sort of more of that the Tamagotchi lore, along with,

53
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:04,500
you know, stuff being smeared with gamer crud.

54
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:07,700
There's bats and things that are adjacent to bats and,

55
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:13,100
you know, they sail past hissing and but now on your left as you sort of come

56
00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:18,140
into a bit of a larger opening in this weird windy Mountain Dew Cave River.

57
00:04:18,140 --> 00:04:21,260
There's like, I started talking about this towards the end of the last session,

58
00:04:21,260 --> 00:04:25,500
but there's like three kind of small apartment complexes that are kind of on

59
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:29,900
your left where the gamers are gaming, masturbating, and generally being foul

60
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:36,860
things. The little gamer that is with you tells you, Patrick, you gotta go.

61
00:04:40,540 --> 00:04:46,380
And which basically means, you know, this is where the recently turned gamers live.

62
00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:51,260
So gamers who left civilization to go join the gaming, the gaming, you know, clan.

63
00:04:51,260 --> 00:04:57,100
And and so they're they some of them almost look normal still, like they haven't completely turned into Falmer.

64
00:04:57,100 --> 00:04:59,460
You know, they still have their eyes.

65
00:04:59,460 --> 00:05:07,940
They still like don't have totally blue skin, but they have a lot to prove to be given access to better games like Mario.

66
00:05:09,260 --> 00:05:11,260
Yeah, I say

67
00:05:11,260 --> 00:05:21,940
Which translates to what the fuck is he saying

68
00:05:21,940 --> 00:05:31,220
So you you okay, you're just being deliberately obtuse. Yeah, so he says - he says also

69
00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:39,440
Which means like stay silent. We have to be quiet as you float down this river

70
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:45,380
However, it seems you know, he doesn't say this but like he says we have to be quiet

71
00:05:45,380 --> 00:05:50,740
He said earlier like, you know, my big brothers aren't as you know, friendly to strangers as I am

72
00:05:50,740 --> 00:05:51,540
but

73
00:05:51,540 --> 00:05:54,780
Essentially he's saying is that we have to you have to proceed with caution

74
00:05:54,780 --> 00:06:01,340
but it also seems like before you guys were kind of drifting down the river in this raft, but this is basically kind of like

75
00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:04,620
Where the it becomes still waters, right?

76
00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:09,140
This is where you would dock to go into your apartment complex inside of the massive gamer cave

77
00:06:09,140 --> 00:06:14,700
So it's - you have to try to find a way to paddle across safely without

78
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:19,020
alarming this like giant building filled with gamers these like

79
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:21,620
three sort of like

80
00:06:21,620 --> 00:06:25,100
Like small apartment buildings that have gamers in them

81
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:27,260
So yeah

82
00:06:27,260 --> 00:06:29,260
Mmm, what's happening?

83
00:06:29,780 --> 00:06:31,780
Let me check my inventory

84
00:06:31,780 --> 00:06:34,540
See if I have a paddle. I

85
00:06:34,540 --> 00:06:41,660
Have I have two pipes we use those as paddles. That's a good idea. Can I use my sword as a paddle?

86
00:06:41,660 --> 00:06:48,860
Yeah, you can use the USB blade as a paddle - okay. I hop to the front and I just start I start fucking

87
00:06:48,860 --> 00:06:52,280
Paddling away, dude. Okay, so I

88
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:56,900
Will I will remind you that he said to that you should probably try to be quiet

89
00:06:56,900 --> 00:07:01,060
Are you gonna try or are you just gonna go? I just want to let you know in case you didn't remember

90
00:07:01,060 --> 00:07:03,660
Yeah, I'm just gonna go

91
00:07:03,660 --> 00:07:09,700
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, I'd be quiet. What are you doing? You're killed Sullivan wait

92
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:12,980
I tie up I tie up

93
00:07:12,980 --> 00:07:15,580
You guys my character or you?

94
00:07:15,580 --> 00:07:22,540
Characters because I'm gonna paddle right? I've had a lot of hard as I forgot that friendship means nothing. That's true. That's a good point Caleb

95
00:07:22,540 --> 00:07:24,540
I completely forgot about that

96
00:07:24,540 --> 00:07:31,540
it

97
00:07:31,540 --> 00:07:48,540
I'm

98
00:07:48,540 --> 00:07:50,540
a

99
00:07:50,540 --> 00:07:55,540
- Okay. I was trying to figure, I was trying to unfriend you.

100
00:07:55,540 --> 00:07:58,380
- So, there it is. Everybody.

101
00:07:58,380 --> 00:08:02,100
- You already had a friend request from, oh that's...

102
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:04,560
I got a friend request from Nick Disney.

103
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:06,400
- Nice, that's great.

104
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:09,700
I'm gonna try and, so before Cameron can tie me up,

105
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:14,700
I jump to the front and I go Winklevoss twins on the...

106
00:08:14,700 --> 00:08:16,460
- Before he can do that, I tie him up.

107
00:08:16,460 --> 00:08:20,460
- So, there are ways to resolve these things in the game, yeah.

108
00:08:20,460 --> 00:08:22,660
Caleb, how about you just do a quiet row?

109
00:08:22,660 --> 00:08:24,860
Can we just do rock, paper, scissors for once?

110
00:08:24,860 --> 00:08:27,660
No, I'm gonna use my strengths to overpower you.

111
00:08:27,660 --> 00:08:31,220
I'm gonna use strength and I'm gonna wrestle you.

112
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:32,460
I yield.

113
00:08:32,460 --> 00:08:35,300
Okay, I tie you up.

114
00:08:35,300 --> 00:08:39,380
Yeah, I don't just tie you up.

115
00:08:39,380 --> 00:08:41,820
You can't, people are gonna hear that.

116
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:45,540
I quietly place him into the water and drown.

117
00:08:45,540 --> 00:08:47,800
(laughing)

118
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:48,780
Okay.

119
00:08:48,780 --> 00:08:50,420
You shouldn't have yielded.

120
00:08:50,420 --> 00:08:50,920
Wow.

121
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:53,620
So I don't put him in the okay.

122
00:08:53,620 --> 00:08:55,220
You can't take back.

123
00:08:55,220 --> 00:08:58,720
I let I put his I put his feet and I put his toes in the water.

124
00:08:58,720 --> 00:08:59,920
That's cold.

125
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:00,620
Okay.

126
00:09:00,620 --> 00:09:04,820
Yeah, I want to start to hear what is happening now.

127
00:09:04,820 --> 00:09:10,000
Okay, so I go over to start wrestling with Ray William Johnson and he just

128
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,320
instantly goes limp.

129
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:17,300
And I use I give up why go on I use my cords that are coming out of his body

130
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:18,220
to tie him up.

131
00:09:18,220 --> 00:09:19,220
This is fine.

132
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:21,120
and then i said i'm on the edge of the

133
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:23,160
boat or the ship or whatever it is a night

134
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:27,520
dangles toes into the water do you know if you're still here do self check while

135
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:28,080
you're

136
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:29,520
tying up your friend

137
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:33,040
i'm a funny story with my own eyes yeah you do it pretty what do you do

138
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:36,040
i'm a couple of my hands and i start drinking the water

139
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:38,760
okay yet is like mountain dew about our last

140
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:40,120
well

141
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:41,960
does it heal you randomly

142
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:43,440
you know it randomly

143
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:45,840
taste like mountain dew but i have said

144
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:49,320
it's pretty rare and does not need to heal you in real life yes

145
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:51,160
but

146
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:52,320
here in a lot of

147
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:56,940
here a lot of nonsense and sometimes i have some it turns over

148
00:09:56,940 --> 00:10:00,860
i mean you're you're yes so so so can't we're gonna sit here until cable

149
00:10:00,860 --> 00:10:04,240
apologizes

150
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:08,020
well we're gonna be a role in that there is come on we got a little

151
00:10:08,020 --> 00:10:11,260
or you know it's our business your game so that we gotta go

152
00:10:11,260 --> 00:10:14,260
I'm sure he's sorry, you know.

153
00:10:14,260 --> 00:10:16,260
Are you sure?

154
00:10:16,260 --> 00:10:17,260
I'm...

155
00:10:17,260 --> 00:10:18,260
I tape his mouth.

156
00:10:18,260 --> 00:10:19,260
Don't do an inside check.

157
00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:22,260
I'm pretty sure though that you're sorry.

158
00:10:22,260 --> 00:10:24,260
Nope.

159
00:10:24,260 --> 00:10:29,260
Okay, yeah, so you can start paddling with the pipes.

160
00:10:29,260 --> 00:10:32,260
I would say roll...

161
00:10:32,260 --> 00:10:36,260
Let's do athletics first to see how well you do it.

162
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:38,260
It's pretty hard to paddle with, like, pipes,

163
00:10:38,260 --> 00:10:40,260
but let's see what you can do.

164
00:10:40,260 --> 00:10:49,260
25. That's really good. Yeah. So you're able to do this pretty easily, but now let's also have you roll stealth for while you're doing this.

165
00:10:49,260 --> 00:10:52,260
11. That's not so good.

166
00:10:52,260 --> 00:10:55,260
I rolled stealth too.

167
00:10:55,260 --> 00:11:03,260
So here's what we can, I'm going to play out a little bit of what happens and then you'll have opportunities to potentially do something.

168
00:11:03,260 --> 00:11:10,760
What happens is that you get decently, like, with that 25, even though you were only like an 11 on stealth,

169
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:15,760
you still got pretty far just like right away without being noticed.

170
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:24,760
And with that 11, you start to hear inside of the apartment complex, you see a light turn on in one of the windows,

171
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:28,760
and you see one of them start to look out the window.

172
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:32,960
so this is your opportunity if there's something you have in mind that you can

173
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:33,920
do

174
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:37,240
i would say like you would all kind of be aware of that like

175
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:40,920
uh... load house wasn't quite quiet enough i act like a statue

176
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:42,320
who have kept

177
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:45,480
you continue to stay still yeah

178
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:47,640
uh... i'd i laid down

179
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:49,420
how how do you business

180
00:11:49,420 --> 00:11:50,520
is this like

181
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:54,120
this is shaped it's a raft that shaped like the mass effect yeah it's it's just

182
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:56,040
like a a flat raft

183
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:58,000
okay

184
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,360
- Yeah, let's jump off the raft,

185
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:03,220
like slip into the water and hold our breath underneath.

186
00:12:03,220 --> 00:12:04,060
So it looks like we're going to roll out here.

187
00:12:04,060 --> 00:12:05,100
- Yeah, could I do that?

188
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:07,560
- Yeah, I'll give you all a chance to do that.

189
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:09,080
- Can I take Caleb with me?

190
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:13,080
Can I get a, so he doesn't get spotted either?

191
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:14,520
- Yeah, you'll have a slight penalty

192
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:15,640
just 'cause you're carrying somebody.

193
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:18,040
- Yeah, yeah, but hey, I'll do it for my friend.

194
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:22,220
- All right, so this is still about another thing.

195
00:12:22,220 --> 00:12:24,940
- About what? - So what do we roll?

196
00:12:24,940 --> 00:12:27,340
- So everyone I would say is gonna roll still.

197
00:12:27,340 --> 00:12:30,340
So, Sullivan, the Baby Gamer, all of them.

198
00:12:30,340 --> 00:12:33,340
Sullivan as well.

199
00:12:33,340 --> 00:12:35,940
Oh, I have a character sheet for him now.

200
00:12:35,940 --> 00:12:37,440
- Where was that roll, Cameron? - I got 8.

201
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:39,940
- Oh, where's that roll earlier? - More statuette, whatever.

202
00:12:39,940 --> 00:12:41,940
- What? - Where's that roll earlier?

203
00:12:41,940 --> 00:12:43,140
- You got a 22. - I got so many good...

204
00:12:43,140 --> 00:12:45,740
I got good... My first two rolls were really good.

205
00:12:45,740 --> 00:12:48,540
You should have tried it if you don't want my rolls.

206
00:12:48,540 --> 00:12:49,740
I did. I got a 16.

207
00:12:49,740 --> 00:12:52,240
Okay, let's go, Sullivan. Go, Sullivan.

208
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:54,540
- How did he do? - He got 12.

209
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:55,940
He did okay.

210
00:12:55,940 --> 00:13:02,940
So yeah, you all sort of hop into the water pretty stealthily.

211
00:13:02,940 --> 00:13:06,940
Baby Gamer does fine himself, the little gamer.

212
00:13:06,940 --> 00:13:12,940
And though obviously with that eight,

213
00:13:12,940 --> 00:13:15,940
even though Cameron you're doing pretty well, or Bloodtust you're doing pretty well,

214
00:13:15,940 --> 00:13:19,940
there's some activity that that one in the window sort of starts to notice that

215
00:13:19,940 --> 00:13:21,940
and looks a little bit closer.

216
00:13:21,940 --> 00:13:51,540
um and uh Sullivan also is is is drawing their attention it's sort of in line with you so you see one of them you see it look in the window and when you see the lights go off in that window again and you see the baby givers are which is basing run I mean swim swim um so I untie I untie Caleb yeah I just

217
00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:56,540
You float face down when you're trying to convince your brother at the pool that you're dead.

218
00:13:56,540 --> 00:13:58,540
[laughter]

219
00:13:58,540 --> 00:14:02,540
And I'm just kind of holding my breath, hoping somebody does something.

220
00:14:02,540 --> 00:14:08,540
Yeah, so you see that gamer rush away, and now that that other little gamer has screamed.

221
00:14:08,540 --> 00:14:12,540
I'm going to have all of you guys do just a--

222
00:14:12,540 --> 00:14:16,540
We're going to just basically do your--

223
00:14:16,540 --> 00:14:22,620
much of your movement speed. So like just do everyone move up like I guess like half of

224
00:14:22,620 --> 00:14:30,500
like it's going to look like 30 feet like not 30 feet though like go go like 15. Everyone

225
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:34,660
like go up like you're swimming in the direction like you're trying to get out of there. At

226
00:14:34,660 --> 00:14:39,700
this point the the the baby is sort of like running up on here and jumping back into the

227
00:14:39,700 --> 00:14:43,460
the water and the little gamer I should say.

228
00:14:43,460 --> 00:14:51,800
And you look up now, you hear a noise, you hear more footsteps and like as they climb

229
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:56,080
and you see them and you start to see their heads, all of them poking their little heads

230
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:57,080
over the roof.

231
00:14:57,080 --> 00:15:00,020
It's like kind of this eerie sight as you're looking up and seeing them.

232
00:15:00,020 --> 00:15:03,580
It looks kind of very German expressionist-y.

233
00:15:03,580 --> 00:15:05,300
And then you see their heads all disappear.

234
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:07,300
and then you hear...

235
00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:09,300
[hissing]

236
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:11,300
Oh my god, they got a Hitachi wand!

237
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:13,300
[laughter]

238
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:15,300
Yeah, you hear one of them come,

239
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:17,300
and then you hear...

240
00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:19,300
which, I don't want to know what that sounds like, folks, you know?

241
00:15:19,300 --> 00:15:21,300
And, uh, you...

242
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:23,300
you also start to see something,

243
00:15:23,300 --> 00:15:25,300
like, kind of like, start to form

244
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:27,300
on top, like a, of, like,

245
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:29,300
Voltron-y, like,

246
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:31,300
uh, a massive

247
00:15:31,300 --> 00:15:33,300
metal crane.

248
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:35,300
*sigh*

249
00:15:35,300 --> 00:15:43,540
that is like just with the quickness shooting down to fucking like scoop you the fuck up

250
00:15:43,540 --> 00:15:48,240
um with like an insane like level of speed it's like and you start to look you also see

251
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:53,880
in that same instant like all the gamers like in the windows basically it looks like they're

252
00:15:53,880 --> 00:16:00,960
all playing a crane game um in sync with one another um so all of you roll dexterity saving

253
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:16,280
throw. 15. 23. 9. Okay, and now I gotta do for my main man Sully. Sully, what up? Oh,

254
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:19,760
it's not the right one, but it would have been whatever that is anyway, because it's

255
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:26,920
just he has zero on everything. And then he's the most average character ever. And then...

256
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:36,720
say that. Sorry. And then, uh, I'm really sorry about that. The baby gamer. Uh, um, that's

257
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:43,400
cool. This is very cool. Actually. Patrick Yoda, Cameron or blow toss piss and the baby

258
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:50,760
gamer. All of you are able to sort of deftly get out of the way of this crane and me too.

259
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:56,280
And Ray William Johnson. I forgot to mention Ray William Johnson. Ray William Johnson is

260
00:16:56,280 --> 00:17:14,900
and

261
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:22,520
top of the roof where all of the the guys are all of those gamers are who are

262
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:27,980
waiting for who are there thank you yeah and you see that they haven't like

263
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:31,420
they're not doing anything two of them are just standing in front of like the

264
00:17:31,420 --> 00:17:34,580
door to get down from the roof but the rest of them are still focusing on

265
00:17:34,580 --> 00:17:42,900
trying to win the game to win this crane game in their minds but it's it's like a

266
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:48,740
as you guys land and you take from that landing

267
00:17:48,740 --> 00:17:55,700
oh no no damage not too much zero damage

268
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:57,700
I only have 10 health

269
00:17:57,700 --> 00:17:59,700
I chose to game that one night

270
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:01,700
I'm so smart at this game

271
00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:03,700
I'm gonna play dead

272
00:18:03,700 --> 00:18:05,700
ok yeah immediately

273
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:07,700
roll performance

274
00:18:07,700 --> 00:18:09,700
ok I'm gonna stick my tongue out

275
00:18:09,700 --> 00:18:11,700
I really quickly grab a sharpie and draw x's on my eyes

276
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:26,700
is

277
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:39,840
amazing performer. Sullivan is like NOOOOOO! My talent is wasted in this one moment.

278
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:48,840
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,

279
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:55,840
oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,

280
00:18:55,840 --> 00:19:02,840
oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,

281
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:09,840
oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,

282
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:24,840
with

283
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:29,280
killing it there's tapping into something and being a demon where or

284
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:32,160
also maybe like you're literally shutting down like you could go into

285
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:35,720
sleep mode because your computer I think it was the shit in my pants personally

286
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:42,200
shit in your pants yeah brother yeah yeah so I'm see I see him playing dead on the

287
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:45,200
top of the roof and I'm like reconsidering everything like I'm like I

288
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:53,040
never should have tied him up this is all my fault I'm doing a backstroke and

289
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:55,040
I'm just drinking the water.

290
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:57,040
[laughter]

291
00:19:57,040 --> 00:20:03,040
So you can all move up, you know, another like 15 feet on this map,

292
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:05,040
and the crane is going to try to get you again.

293
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:07,040
Hmm.

294
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:08,040
Alright.

295
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:10,040
Is there anything, um...

296
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:12,040
Or yeah, I mean, there's other stuff you can do. That's like...

297
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:16,040
Yeah, is there any way that we could like, uh, just kill all of them at once?

298
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:19,040
Yeah, we have a nuclear bomb.

299
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:20,040
Yeah.

300
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:24,000
i mean you could check your inventory i don't think i did uh... don't add into

301
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,280
your inventory now

302
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:29,800
i'm look i'm staring at your inventory i think i'm missing some stuff in my

303
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:31,980
inventory

304
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:33,420
i don't think that's true

305
00:20:33,420 --> 00:20:38,720
stop i'd see what you're doing i can see what you're doing what if i okay well

306
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:42,440
what if i put one hundred dollars in the crane

307
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:44,600
yeah i have one dollar to

308
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:47,840
we could put a hundred one dollars in the crane with a note that says this is to

309
00:20:47,840 --> 00:21:02,840
to

310
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:09,840
both

311
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:16,840
in

312
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:22,440
at pockets i guess to get out your hundred dollars your sticky wet pockets

313
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:24,620
and this crane just fuckin

314
00:21:24,620 --> 00:21:27,980
scoops you both up and a little gamer

315
00:21:27,980 --> 00:21:30,400
and you all go on the roof

316
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:33,100
there was a way you get past the guys are

317
00:21:33,100 --> 00:21:36,240
you just doing okay but yet now you're on the roof

318
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:37,340
uh...

319
00:21:37,340 --> 00:21:39,300
or a jump off the roof back into the

320
00:21:39,300 --> 00:21:41,920
manned air

321
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:43,800
role a uh...

322
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:47,300
because it was gonna happen there's a goal line of them in front of you

323
00:21:47,300 --> 00:21:51,680
so you can try to like run through the right try to run them down

324
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:54,440
uh... wait i can i can speak their language

325
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:56,980
yeah so if you want to try that you can to okay

326
00:21:56,980 --> 00:22:00,080
also also i guess both of you role

327
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:03,960
inside to see if you think really on johnson's dead

328
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:07,080
or if you can tell the six eighteen

329
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:10,520
okay at that you can you can probably tell the rewinding of the income i'm

330
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:12,000
poking in with my hoagie

331
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:15,800
the classic frank i'm still not moving to them so that the uh... but i'm not

332
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:19,440
hospice you are pretty sure he's dead

333
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:20,160
yeah

334
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:25,240
i say i don't move it don't uh... be dead if you get a

335
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:29,560
i continue to be dead because it is a strong resolve and i'm gay

336
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:32,220
uh...

337
00:22:32,220 --> 00:22:35,600
but he sees all of this still like trying to be dead he's just like shivering

338
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:36,760
crying

339
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:38,760
the yes so there is uh... they're all

340
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:40,760
wind up on the roof

341
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:41,860
so

342
00:22:42,860 --> 00:22:49,700
I go up like Chris Pratt in talking to the Raptors in Jurassic World and I have my hands out

343
00:22:49,700 --> 00:22:53,020
And you're clicking

344
00:22:53,020 --> 00:23:02,060
Do you do any bloopers too since like

345
00:23:02,060 --> 00:23:11,500
He's anything funny and that says yeah, what did all that say it said I love you

346
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:24,980
to

347
00:23:24,980 --> 00:23:33,060
completely lost. Okay let me try again. That was my blooper take. Should I just roll persuasion?

348
00:23:33,060 --> 00:23:37,620
And then yeah they nod when you say let me try again that was my blooper take. They get that.

349
00:23:47,380 --> 00:23:56,820
You said something about their mothers, their brood mother, you know, or about Zoe Quinn

350
00:23:56,820 --> 00:23:58,900
that made them all really angry.

351
00:23:58,900 --> 00:24:03,380
Wait, I've got an idea.

352
00:24:03,380 --> 00:24:06,340
This is my fight song!

353
00:24:06,340 --> 00:24:09,260
Take back my life song!

354
00:24:09,260 --> 00:24:18,700
The crane whips around and just like opens its maw and pushes all of you off the roof

355
00:24:18,700 --> 00:24:19,700
off the other side.

356
00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:20,700
What about me?

357
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:21,700
Oh no.

358
00:24:21,700 --> 00:24:24,220
You too because you're just caught up in the scoop but you're just like dead.

359
00:24:24,220 --> 00:24:28,420
I thought that they would freak out because I sang the feminist song.

360
00:24:28,420 --> 00:24:35,140
Yeah, they're, they, and as you guys, you guys are basically falling now like, like

361
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:36,940
tens of feet probably.

362
00:24:36,940 --> 00:24:37,940
Ugh.

363
00:24:37,940 --> 00:24:38,940
And uh.

364
00:24:38,940 --> 00:24:51,940
to

365
00:24:51,940 --> 00:25:01,540
start to see some weird glowing neon below you, you can't quite make it out, and you

366
00:25:01,540 --> 00:25:07,820
crash land onto something really, just really freaking out there.

367
00:25:07,820 --> 00:25:10,660
Sullivan, the baby gamer, all of you.

368
00:25:10,660 --> 00:25:13,700
So let me get all of you in here.

369
00:25:13,700 --> 00:25:15,980
One second, I also have to think where...

370
00:25:15,980 --> 00:25:16,980
Do we take damage?

371
00:25:16,980 --> 00:25:21,140
Oh yeah, no, we're going to resolve all that fun stuff.

372
00:25:21,140 --> 00:25:22,140
not

373
00:25:22,140 --> 00:25:26,580
now you can't feel like the kid who has the teacher what about the homework okay

374
00:25:26,580 --> 00:25:28,380
don't remind him about damage

375
00:25:28,380 --> 00:25:30,660
and he would have forgotten

376
00:25:30,660 --> 00:25:32,820
i'm getting your set about it so

377
00:25:32,820 --> 00:25:35,140
and it looks like kind of complete

378
00:25:35,140 --> 00:25:37,480
uh... blackness around you

379
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:42,400
uh... you can all kind of c in front of one another and then your eyes

380
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:44,680
uh... begin to adjust

381
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:46,600
somewhat slowly

382
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:48,840
so let me uh...

383
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:50,740
you can you see now a little bit more

384
00:25:50,740 --> 00:25:51,600
near

385
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:55,220
yes so what i'm doing in the map by the way it's all these

386
00:25:55,220 --> 00:26:00,180
to all you uh... uh... listeners out there isn't doing a fog of war

387
00:26:00,180 --> 00:26:01,600
setting on roll twenty

388
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:03,780
'cause they're in this very dark area

389
00:26:03,780 --> 00:26:06,780
and slowly to reveal the map to them as they walk around

390
00:26:06,780 --> 00:26:09,980
uh...

391
00:26:09,980 --> 00:26:14,480
uh... merit so someone's trying to write on top of part of the matter of the

392
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:29,480
the

393
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:36,520
a weird black stone in front of you. You can see that there.

394
00:26:36,520 --> 00:26:42,440
And then also there's a door and some white stone on the other side of you. You're in the

395
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:49,080
hallway it looks like. And below you is a strong clear glass floor. And below it is

396
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:55,000
an endless sea of stars oozing and flowing through. It looks kind of like

397
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:58,520
When you clip through a level in an Unreal game,

398
00:26:58,520 --> 00:27:02,040
and you see like the sea level below it because the devs leave that in,

399
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:05,720
that's basically what it looks like below you.

400
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:09,640
You don't really know where you are except that you

401
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:13,800
are actually on top of something right now on the map. There's also a pedestal in

402
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:18,600
front of you, and it has like sort of four

403
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:21,720
little spokes in it. They look like it has these like sort of

404
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:27,120
gems in them, but they're like almost sucked of their light, completely dull.

405
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:28,120
Hmm.

406
00:27:28,120 --> 00:27:31,040
We see something weird.

407
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:33,480
Can I touch the pedestal?

408
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:34,480
Yeah.

409
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:35,480
I touched it.

410
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:37,480
Yeah, you touch it.

411
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:39,360
Nothing too odd about it.

412
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:45,760
As you look at sort of the four gems, you see that each of them are like, one of them

413
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:50,920
has like, like a symbol on it that looks like sort of like swirling sand.

414
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:56,580
of them has like a volcano, one of them has like a what looks like a like a

415
00:27:56,580 --> 00:28:03,260
like a glacier, and another one has what looks like some sort of like a like a

416
00:28:03,260 --> 00:28:08,320
toxin right like a you know triangle with like a skull in it in each of the

417
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:20,560
four gems. It's Pokemon! I continue to play dead. I solved enough puzzles in this

418
00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:27,280
fucking dungeon. Oh yeah. Puzzles. Puzzles. It's called a puzzle. Also, uh, oh yeah, you

419
00:28:27,280 --> 00:28:34,340
guys have to take some damage. Damn it, I was hoping you would forget about it. I mean,

420
00:28:34,340 --> 00:28:40,340
I'm gonna be generous since they tossed you down here for a reason. Just kill me. Oh, you're

421
00:28:40,340 --> 00:28:49,340
dead, for sure. Yes. Yeah, that's a solid 11 damage to all of you. Yep, I'm dead. Yeah,

422
00:28:49,340 --> 00:29:14,340
I'm

423
00:29:14,340 --> 00:29:22,880
like like it's like a black giant slab of stone it's like a wall that that you

424
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:27,140
could see like the edges of it glowing almost so that you can actually make it

425
00:29:27,140 --> 00:29:30,780
out among the blackness and then you see a wall in front of you and then like

426
00:29:30,780 --> 00:29:37,600
metal doors that has like a symbol on it that matches the symbol on the pedestal

427
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:43,540
like the symbols on the pedestal so can I heal them before anything yeah

428
00:29:43,540 --> 00:29:51,540
Absolutely. Okay. I'm gonna use my four skin. You're gonna use your four skin. Yeah, so you create this massive

429
00:29:51,540 --> 00:29:55,080
Foreskin that can heal people. So that's another three

430
00:29:55,080 --> 00:30:00,400
Techno slime points for you. Okay that you used so you should be

431
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:04,760
This should be actually at um, she used it already. It should be at seven

432
00:30:04,760 --> 00:30:08,760
It's um, yeah, and so roll you can roll now the

433
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:11,840
roll 1d 10

434
00:30:12,220 --> 00:30:19,220
for

435
00:30:19,220 --> 00:30:34,220
a

436
00:30:34,220 --> 00:30:39,500
play dead. Okay, roll a performance check again this time. Because you have to sort of replay

437
00:30:39,500 --> 00:30:53,260
dead. 21. Very good! Everyone's pretty sure you're dead. Yeah. Well, since he's dead,

438
00:30:53,260 --> 00:31:00,260
I guess he won't be needing anything in his inventory. I'm dead, brother. I don't care.

439
00:31:00,260 --> 00:31:01,260
I mean, go ahead.

440
00:31:01,260 --> 00:31:04,060
You're not fooling me into waking up.

441
00:31:04,060 --> 00:31:05,060
I'm going to take something.

442
00:31:05,060 --> 00:31:08,060
I guess he won't mind if I tickle him since he's dead.

443
00:31:08,060 --> 00:31:15,360
You're like a little hum for my body as I'm like already kind of laughing.

444
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:18,560
Yeah, roll a constitution saving throw.

445
00:31:18,560 --> 00:31:20,760

00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:32,000
stuff you you do and try to figure out how long it probably takes and then this

500
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:38,440
thing is moving okay what are the different doors that are around us there

501
00:34:38,440 --> 00:34:41,800
are no doors around you I thought you said there was no sorry there's one door

502
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:45,940
around you there's one door in front of you it's like this metal door what

503
00:34:45,940 --> 00:34:50,840
symbol does it have it's like over here it has the four symbols of all four of

504
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:55,280
them the stones yeah all right let's go through the door wait did we take the

505
00:34:55,280 --> 00:35:00,480
stones? Yeah. You can't open the door. Can I hold one? Yeah, I'm guessing that this is a puzzle.

506
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:08,480
I give Patrick the toxic stone. I put it in my mouth because he's toxic. Wait, honestly,

507
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:12,160
what if all of us have to hold a different stone? That's what I've been thinking. There's four

508
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:18,080
stones. Yeah. And there's four of us. Okay, I give the stones a round. What are the colors again?

509
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:20,240
it's and

510
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:21,360
poison

511
00:35:21,360 --> 00:35:23,800
volcano and ice i think

512
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:27,600
yeah there's no colors in them right now can totally volcano

513
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:30,000
yeah you take volcano all take

514
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,720
uh... ice 'cause i'm cool

515
00:35:31,720 --> 00:35:33,580
and i'll get sullivan said kiss

516
00:35:33,580 --> 00:35:35,360
you know you know

517
00:35:35,360 --> 00:35:36,880
noise is getting louder

518
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:38,320
removed johnson

519
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:41,120
uh... that was not an action

520
00:35:41,120 --> 00:35:44,080
handing out a little bit of a lot of the night

521
00:35:44,080 --> 00:35:48,080
I think it's getting louder though, because you believe it's getting louder.

522
00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:59,080
And, uh, yeah, so, so, uh, you, the door, the stones in the door, it's not like a thing where you can slot it in, it doesn't look like, you know.

523
00:35:59,080 --> 00:36:00,080
Yeah.

524
00:36:00,080 --> 00:36:07,160
If you investigate the stones, you guys can probably see something just because I was gonna say you're basically are investigating it

525
00:36:07,160 --> 00:36:11,200
So I'd want you to just roll it roll investigation to see if you you

526
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:15,960
At this point because you're kind of 18 17. It's all very

527
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:19,040
Pretty good 15. Yeah, that's all pretty good

528
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:21,920
Wow, okay

529
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:24,520
Blowtoss as you hand out the stones

530
00:36:24,520 --> 00:36:29,560
To to everyone

531
00:36:29,560 --> 00:36:35,560
They start to, they have like a diff, they start to glow a little bit with the color.

532
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:39,560
But, you notice, what stone do you have by the way, Blotas?

533
00:36:39,560 --> 00:36:41,560
I have the ice one.

534
00:36:41,560 --> 00:36:43,560
Okay.

535
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:50,560
As you walk towards, and Patrick Yoda and Ray William Johnson, you kind of all notice this, but from the stones.

536
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:57,560
As you walk towards Ray William Johnson to hand him the lava stone,

537
00:36:57,560 --> 00:37:03,560
You notice your ice stone, the faint, the faintest blue that is glowing in it,

538
00:37:03,560 --> 00:37:06,560
like ice blue that's glowing in it, starts to die out.

539
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:11,560
And so does the faintest red of the lava stone.

540
00:37:11,560 --> 00:37:15,560
And when you walk back to give a hand to something to Patrick Yoda,

541
00:37:15,560 --> 00:37:18,560
it starts to glow brighter again, those two.

542
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:23,560
But Patrick Yoda's, the, what Patrick Yoda, which one did you get?

543
00:37:23,560 --> 00:37:24,560
I had poison.

544
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:25,560
Yeah.

545
00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:31,480
Yours, you notice that yours, if you move to your character's, when we're looking at

546
00:37:31,480 --> 00:37:36,080
the screen, to your right, it glows a bit brighter.

547
00:37:36,080 --> 00:37:38,240
And to your left it gets dimmer.

548
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:45,400
So lava, ice, glows brighter as you go to your left.

549
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:47,840
Poison and sand seem to glow brighter when you go to your right.

550
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:50,440
Okay, so me and Sullivan are going to go to the right.

551
00:37:50,440 --> 00:37:53,440
Yeah, I mean ray william johnson go to the left

552
00:37:53,440 --> 00:38:01,260
Okay. All right. Yeah move your characters where you want to move them and just yeah, let me be cautious. But okay, cool

553
00:38:01,260 --> 00:38:06,000
Now that's fine where you were patch go. No, that's one. That wasn't I was in the door

554
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:09,900
All right. Okay, and let me uh reveal a little bit more of the map to you. Oh

555
00:38:09,900 --> 00:38:13,040
Okay, I'm starting to see stuff

556
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:14,560
Yeah

557
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:19,380
So as you're moving through the neon glowing of those stones you start to see them more

558
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:23,620
uh... you see purple ones you see green one you see white one you see a bit of a

559
00:38:23,620 --> 00:38:25,720
red one so then and uh...

560
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:28,920
patrick you know that

561
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:30,440
you also now

562
00:38:30,440 --> 00:38:31,980
solvent in patrick you know that

563
00:38:31,980 --> 00:38:34,440
you hear the something now

564
00:38:34,440 --> 00:38:38,300
i hear something that it's quieter for you it's quiet it for me

565
00:38:38,300 --> 00:38:39,800
no known that's why

566
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:43,360
and spider for her family dot sand blowtoss this

567
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:48,360
but it's louder for you and it's louder for me actually

568
00:38:48,360 --> 00:38:52,640
And so you, you're, um, but yeah, so, uh, and,

569
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:55,480
and the stone is glowing brighter. The, the, the,

570
00:38:55,480 --> 00:38:58,960
the stone that's glowing brighter now is the, uh, sand one,

571
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:01,640
the poison one isn't glowing as bright, but it's,

572
00:39:01,640 --> 00:39:04,200
it's glowing a little bit brighter, but not as bright as the sand.

573
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:06,080
One is glown. Um,

574
00:39:06,080 --> 00:39:09,160
same for you blow toss and Ray William Johnson,

575
00:39:09,160 --> 00:39:12,240
but the ice one is glowing brighter. Not as much as the lava one.

576
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:17,280
Okay. I'm going to run over to the red, the little bit of red that I see.

577
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:25,980
I'm gonna go like over over here. I feel like it's a safe bet with lava. Okay.

578
00:39:25,980 --> 00:39:35,520
Oh this is getting tough. Okay. I see hair. From the bottom of the fog of war. Is that Gabe Newell?

579
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:41,960
That was gonna be my guess too. Yeah. Wait can I... can me and Sullivan hide behind this?

580
00:39:41,960 --> 00:39:48,960
I'd

581
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:53,320
shadows

582
00:39:53,320 --> 00:39:54,120
this

583
00:39:54,120 --> 00:39:55,120
just

584
00:39:55,120 --> 00:39:59,240
fact i think it's

585
00:39:59,240 --> 00:40:00,760
making your own

586
00:40:00,760 --> 00:40:02,520
group is a little

587
00:40:02,520 --> 00:40:04,920
uh...

588
00:40:04,920 --> 00:40:09,440
and it's like this hero in case it looks like the old woman from uh...

589
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:11,440
uh... spirited away

590
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:14,400
this life massive ghoulish face

591
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:16,440
start to come out of the shadows

592
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:20,320
uh... really johnson's pressure is you're running by to go to that red area like

593
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:21,640
across the door

594
00:40:21,640 --> 00:40:23,720
you exceed on your right

595
00:40:23,720 --> 00:40:25,160
like you know your periphery

596
00:40:25,160 --> 00:40:29,080
and stand patrick you know that you see it obviously in just dash behind this

597
00:40:29,080 --> 00:40:30,560
uh...

598
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:34,320
and as you begin to see this space

599
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:36,960
you hear a familiar to

600
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:37,800
uh...

601
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:38,640
that

602
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:41,240
uh...

603
00:40:41,240 --> 00:40:43,760
you would recognize as the

604
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:45,760
pac-man

605
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:52,760
game star

606
00:40:52,760 --> 00:40:55,860
and then of course you hear

607
00:40:55,860 --> 00:41:00,520
but uh... but uh... but uh... but uh... but uh... as as i was saying

608
00:41:00,520 --> 00:41:03,920
is approaching closer to you

609
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:04,640
uh...

610
00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:08,220
uh... quite a bit i think that i need to jim

611
00:41:08,220 --> 00:41:11,120
and it makes me eat gabe newell

612
00:41:11,120 --> 00:41:17,040
he's a huge if i need it's like the big dot impact man

613
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:22,040
uh... it does not do that if you need it okay it's not about that i would you

614
00:41:22,040 --> 00:41:26,040
could be a little bit of half will figure it out together

615
00:41:26,040 --> 00:41:30,280
as a group in the room now and i'm gonna get a greater that

616
00:41:30,280 --> 00:41:33,760
can the room get brighter now that i was gonna say the room does get a bit

617
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:35,000
brighter now

618
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:38,040
uh... and you start to hear

619
00:41:38,040 --> 00:41:43,440
the sounds of

620
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:47,640
and you see the baby gamer like the little game early looking around

621
00:41:47,640 --> 00:41:49,600
uh... and everything

622
00:41:49,600 --> 00:41:53,560
uh... and you see these like lights flooding in

623
00:41:53,560 --> 00:41:57,180
you see these massive we're whales below

624
00:41:57,180 --> 00:41:59,280
like this weird news

625
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:01,900
and you look up and you can see

626
00:42:01,900 --> 00:42:05,640
scores of of will of gamers

627
00:42:05,640 --> 00:42:10,640
having a land party watching you all in this maze

628
00:42:10,640 --> 00:42:14,200
uh... while they play halo at the same time

629
00:42:14,200 --> 00:42:15,000
uh...

630
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:19,080
are they like they're like directly above us or are they on like balconies?

631
00:42:19,080 --> 00:42:22,760
they're like directly above you watching you from below. like through like glass? yeah

632
00:42:22,760 --> 00:42:25,040
it's like a dome

633
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:26,120
yeah

634
00:42:26,120 --> 00:42:30,300
okay so obviously the volcano thing is in the the left corner so that one i'm

635
00:42:30,300 --> 00:42:31,800
closest to poison

636
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:33,080
right now so should i

637
00:42:33,080 --> 00:42:34,280
how many

638
00:42:34,280 --> 00:42:37,180
So yeah, we're gonna we're gonna we're gonna map that out. So

639
00:42:37,180 --> 00:42:42,580
basically you're going to be similar to the what we were

640
00:42:42,580 --> 00:42:46,080
doing before with the swimming where you move 15 feet.

641
00:42:46,080 --> 00:42:48,580
Gabe moves 15 feet.

642
00:42:48,580 --> 00:42:53,780
If you come into contact with Gabe, there's a chance that you

643
00:42:53,780 --> 00:42:58,980
could get hurt pretty fucking bad and we'll roll for that when

644
00:42:58,980 --> 00:42:59,680
that happens.

645
00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:04,180
So each time each of you moves 15 feet is when Gabe will move

646
00:43:04,180 --> 00:43:05,440
do his movement

647
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:07,320
uh...

648
00:43:07,320 --> 00:43:09,160
i will tell you now

649
00:43:09,160 --> 00:43:10,160
uh...

650
00:43:10,160 --> 00:43:11,480
uh...

651
00:43:11,480 --> 00:43:15,120
that's putting up was actually a pretty good idea uh... that was i was like

652
00:43:15,120 --> 00:43:17,000
pretty surprised i was like

653
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:20,360
is that i you guys are sick together uh... because yet only one game in

654
00:43:20,360 --> 00:43:21,520
there's

655
00:43:21,520 --> 00:43:25,720
five of you little ghosts

656
00:43:25,720 --> 00:43:26,920
uh... caleb

657
00:43:26,920 --> 00:43:30,760
yes sir i think you want to the wrong place second c love the right here and

658
00:43:30,760 --> 00:43:33,920
- No shit, I head towards that lava.

659
00:43:33,920 --> 00:43:34,760
- I'm just telling you.

660
00:43:34,760 --> 00:43:37,040
- Okay, so I think sand is top right,

661
00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:41,040
poison bottom right, lava bottom left, and ice top left.

662
00:43:41,040 --> 00:43:43,160
- I think ice might be in Gabe's mouth.

663
00:43:43,160 --> 00:43:45,040
- When I, I'll go there then.

664
00:43:45,040 --> 00:43:49,160
When I put this, when we put this up on the Patreon,

665
00:43:49,160 --> 00:43:50,440
I'm also gonna include the map

666
00:43:50,440 --> 00:43:53,380
so everyone can follow along at home.

667
00:43:53,380 --> 00:43:58,880
Because it's, it's, yeah, and bless you as well, Caleb.

668
00:43:58,880 --> 00:44:01,520
so uh... yeah but i won't let one now

669
00:44:01,520 --> 00:44:05,360
but uh... c_n_n_ up to hopefully this is making sense that you are basically

670
00:44:05,360 --> 00:44:10,220
there in a giant okay so i'm i'm gonna move fifteen feet this way

671
00:44:10,220 --> 00:44:14,040
patrick you know you're gonna tell solvin where you want him to go

672
00:44:14,040 --> 00:44:15,080
uh...

673
00:44:15,080 --> 00:44:17,320
or would you want someone to follow you

674
00:44:17,320 --> 00:44:21,840
left to protect him now he's got low health

675
00:44:21,840 --> 00:44:25,480
should what do you guys think i should issue that protects all of inner

676
00:44:25,480 --> 00:44:27,120
uh... welcome

677
00:44:27,120 --> 00:44:39,200
the

678
00:44:39,200 --> 00:44:44,400
I have a feeling none of us are going to be able to kill Gabe.

679
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:47,200
That's just the vibe I get from this.

680
00:44:47,200 --> 00:44:49,200
So, I'm going to push.

681
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:51,200
It's better to just get to the corners.

682
00:44:51,200 --> 00:44:53,200
So, Sullivan goes here and then I go here.

683
00:44:53,200 --> 00:44:55,200
You can move 15, Patrick.

684
00:44:55,200 --> 00:44:57,200
Well, Sullivan's not moving.

685
00:44:57,200 --> 00:44:59,200
We're just running at the same time.

686
00:44:59,200 --> 00:45:01,200
I'm going here.

687
00:45:01,200 --> 00:45:03,200
And then Sullivan's going to go up here.

688
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:05,200
Perfect, yeah.

689
00:45:05,200 --> 00:45:07,200
Okay, so, Patrick Yoda, you're going to go a bit more south.

690
00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:12,600
a bit more south. Sullivan's gonna go where he is now. So a little bit more north towards

691
00:45:12,600 --> 00:45:18,560
the sand. So you're on sort of that tail of where that whale is. And Blotas, where are

692
00:45:18,560 --> 00:45:24,040
you gonna go? And then the little gamer is gonna do his, the little gamer is gonna just

693
00:45:24,040 --> 00:45:33,760
dart up towards the sand as well. Basically, sort of understanding instinctually that Sullivan

694
00:45:33,760 --> 00:45:36,560
is the weak link here, and maybe he can help.

695
00:45:36,560 --> 00:45:38,560
I'm going here.

696
00:45:38,560 --> 00:45:40,560
Okay, cool.

697
00:45:40,560 --> 00:45:43,560
So, um, now...

698
00:45:43,560 --> 00:45:47,560
I'm gonna do a little bit of secret rolling.

699
00:45:47,560 --> 00:45:50,060
How about you do some public rolling?

700
00:45:50,060 --> 00:45:53,060
He's disappeared back into the shadows, as far as you can tell.

701
00:45:53,060 --> 00:45:54,560
Ice cream.

702
00:45:54,560 --> 00:45:55,560
[laughter]

703
00:45:55,560 --> 00:45:57,060
You can't get ice cream right now.

704
00:45:57,060 --> 00:45:58,560
[mimics buzzer]

705
00:45:58,560 --> 00:46:02,060
The rest of you, let's reveal a little bit more of the map.

706
00:46:02,060 --> 00:46:04,180
right of nice

707
00:46:04,180 --> 00:46:05,380
cameras right there

708
00:46:05,380 --> 00:46:07,780
resolve them

709
00:46:07,780 --> 00:46:11,000
for you patrick you know that you can do the map isn't revealed a little anymore

710
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:12,180
for you really

711
00:46:12,180 --> 00:46:13,940
while in that

712
00:46:13,940 --> 00:46:17,060
uh... just cuz of where you are you have some of the map arty reviled the second

713
00:46:17,060 --> 00:46:19,660
has been for you every william johnson

714
00:46:19,660 --> 00:46:22,780
uh... in a little gamer has a bit more than that the revealed

715
00:46:22,780 --> 00:46:24,140
uh... which should help

716
00:46:24,140 --> 00:46:27,780
so you guys are like dashing through you see all these glowing neon like bricks

717
00:46:27,780 --> 00:46:32,780
around you, you hear the thumping of Gabe, you hear the like "WAAA" from above of the

718
00:46:32,780 --> 00:46:42,820
gamers, as this is sort of like this ongoing sort of event, this Pac-Man sort of thing.

719
00:46:42,820 --> 00:46:48,740
Now it's your turn to go again, everyone. You guys can move again.

720
00:46:48,740 --> 00:46:52,220
Okay. I move 15 feet.

721
00:46:52,220 --> 00:46:55,700
Yeah, I move 15 feet. Towards my destination.

722
00:46:55,700 --> 00:46:59,200
i move into the corner with the ice

723
00:46:59,200 --> 00:47:03,120
okay we're gonna resolve that too

724
00:47:03,120 --> 00:47:04,920
solomon is gonna go

725
00:47:04,920 --> 00:47:08,720
we are like i'm only five feet away from the uh...

726
00:47:08,720 --> 00:47:10,340
the poison center

727
00:47:10,340 --> 00:47:13,840
can i just throw the thing or do i have to hold it

728
00:47:13,840 --> 00:47:17,760
so uh... yet let's let's talk this through so

729
00:47:17,760 --> 00:47:18,660
uh...

730
00:47:18,660 --> 00:47:22,040
as you sort of can start to see it's it's the pedestal you were able to see a

731
00:47:22,040 --> 00:47:25,040
a little bit beyond the corner because you can see it's a little bit behind a wall Patrick

732
00:47:25,040 --> 00:47:28,740
Yoda, but you could see like past like the neon green.

733
00:47:28,740 --> 00:47:32,040
Yes, you approach this sort of like acidy thing.

734
00:47:32,040 --> 00:47:35,240
I also want to note sort of what you guys are experiencing

735
00:47:35,240 --> 00:47:40,040
like around you so Patrick Yoda

736
00:47:40,040 --> 00:47:44,740
or I should say actually start with let's start with a blowtoss

737
00:47:44,740 --> 00:47:46,440
piss because you're right on top of the ice

738
00:47:46,440 --> 00:47:51,940
as you like continue to walk like goosebumps form on your skin.

739
00:47:51,940 --> 00:48:03,240
you know, you begin to see your breath like there's just like sharp cool wind like your teeth begin to chatter like the air is frigid like and now it's like snowing on top of you.

740
00:48:03,240 --> 00:48:11,940
So like where you kind of went into like a little biome and you see in this large frozen pond there now that you're on top of this ice.

741
00:48:11,940 --> 00:48:14,840
We're going to have you roll an athletics check.

742
00:48:14,840 --> 00:48:21,840
the

743
00:48:21,840 --> 00:48:28,580
I'll let that that's a good argument roll again. You can roll. I think that's totally for 22. Yeah

744
00:48:28,580 --> 00:48:34,720
You're able to hold your ground. This is a you're who you've were you're from yeah, whoo-hoo bill

745
00:48:34,720 --> 00:48:40,940
This you've been wearing ice skates - yeah, you've been I have been the entire campaign

746
00:48:40,940 --> 00:48:48,020
Yeah, you've been on a lot of ice. This is the slipperiest ice you've ever like been on but you're able to hold your ground

747
00:48:48,020 --> 00:48:50,880
very easily

748
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:56,520
despite that. Ray William Johnson, you also feel because you're sort of in the area of the cold,

749
00:48:56,520 --> 00:49:01,000
you feel a little bit of the cold. When you were by that red, you felt a little bit of like an arid

750
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:06,120
climate. You know, you felt like you could kind of hear the sounds of desert sand, like whipping

751
00:49:06,120 --> 00:49:11,960
around you. Patrick Yoda, and you're because you're approaching this acid area. It's like,

752
00:49:11,960 --> 00:49:19,320
it's like stinky. Yeah, yes, exactly. Like it was like a sizzling sound. You can hear like

753
00:49:19,320 --> 00:49:27,280
bubbling sizzling nastiness you could you know you could see yes very good

754
00:49:27,280 --> 00:49:31,400
yes sort of like they go Bob but if it was like dark day go so so suck a buck

755
00:49:31,400 --> 00:49:35,240
about where I'm from yeah yeah a skeleton you could see like skeleton and bodies

756
00:49:35,240 --> 00:49:38,440
around you they're like half this all this is all making sense yeah cuz

757
00:49:38,440 --> 00:49:42,560
William Johnson's a demon so he's from lava and Sullivan's a frog so he's from

758
00:49:42,560 --> 00:49:45,160
the desert makes perfect sense.

759
00:49:45,160 --> 00:49:45,460
Yeah.

760
00:49:45,460 --> 00:49:52,460
Yeah, and like the smell of rotten flesh sort of like you can smell

761
00:49:52,460 --> 00:49:56,160
that and then something worse and also rotten your uvula like a

762
00:49:56,160 --> 00:49:57,160
speed bag.

763
00:49:57,160 --> 00:49:58,760
You want to vomit so bad.

764
00:49:58,760 --> 00:50:01,860
It's done enough of that already fucking awful.

765
00:50:01,860 --> 00:50:03,860
Your eyes start to sting a little bit.

766
00:50:03,860 --> 00:50:09,360
It's like this horrible acid swamp and solving the frog is in

767
00:50:09,360 --> 00:50:10,660
this like kind of desert area.

768
00:50:10,660 --> 00:50:15,700
he's like the air is kind of dry and he's like a little bit uh a little bit uh

769
00:50:15,700 --> 00:50:20,260
beswept by it i can smell the acid corner just a little bit from where i am

770
00:50:20,260 --> 00:50:23,460
i'm like jesus christ badger gilda what you doing over there

771
00:50:23,460 --> 00:50:30,020
oh my god damn nothing and now that you've all moved

772
00:50:30,020 --> 00:50:34,500
can i do something in addition to moving yeah you can do an action for sure

773
00:50:34,500 --> 00:50:38,100
now you're gonna i want to try i want to i want to see if i can shoot i want to

774
00:50:38,100 --> 00:50:39,900
to see if I can break the glass dome.

775
00:50:39,900 --> 00:50:41,700
It got me Patrick.

776
00:50:41,700 --> 00:50:44,900
You want to see if you can break the glass dome above you?

777
00:50:44,900 --> 00:50:45,900
Yeah.

778
00:50:45,900 --> 00:50:47,700
Okay, yeah, do an attack roll.

779
00:50:47,700 --> 00:50:48,700
And shoot it I guess?

780
00:50:48,700 --> 00:50:49,700
You're right, you're trying to shoot it.

781
00:50:49,700 --> 00:50:50,700
Yeah, with my gun.

782
00:50:50,700 --> 00:50:51,700
14.

783
00:50:51,700 --> 00:50:52,700
Okay.

784
00:50:52,700 --> 00:50:57,820
You shoot it and 14's not really enough.

785
00:50:57,820 --> 00:50:59,200
It's like pretty, it's like tough.

786
00:50:59,200 --> 00:51:01,720
It's like, it's like the floor below you.

787
00:51:01,720 --> 00:51:05,900
So it's not, it's not unbreakable, like there's no, it's glass, but it's like thick glass.

788
00:51:05,900 --> 00:51:07,900
So a 14's like not quite gonna cut it.

789
00:51:07,900 --> 00:51:13,900
But that's like your action you could do for this round of like weird tactics game we're playing.

790
00:51:13,900 --> 00:51:17,900
And now, it is the Gaben's turn.

791
00:51:17,900 --> 00:51:19,900
You hear him creep around the corner.

792
00:51:19,900 --> 00:51:21,900
Oh and he dies, oh my god.

793
00:51:21,900 --> 00:51:25,900
Moving faster. And he's like, "Cake is alive."

794
00:51:25,900 --> 00:51:27,900
He's right in front of me, bro.

795
00:51:27,900 --> 00:51:32,900
Epic gamer Gaben. God Gaben, epic.

796
00:51:32,900 --> 00:51:38,200
He started weird man as he's approaching you ray william johnson

797
00:51:38,200 --> 00:51:45,520
Luckily luckily he just took his second turn and since it's Gabe and we know he's not gonna be taking a third one. Am I right?

798
00:51:45,520 --> 00:51:55,120
You solved another one of my fucking puzzles Cameron, I'm so mad about

799
00:51:55,120 --> 00:52:02,420
That's right. He's gonna not do anything this turn any third turn. He won't do anything. That's right. Yeah

800
00:52:02,420 --> 00:52:26,420
a

801
00:52:26,420 --> 00:52:27,420
man.

802
00:52:27,420 --> 00:52:28,420
Fucking cunt.

803
00:52:28,420 --> 00:52:29,420
Weird man.

804
00:52:29,420 --> 00:52:30,420
Fucking weirdo man.

805
00:52:30,420 --> 00:52:31,420
That's what I'm gonna put on it.

806
00:52:31,420 --> 00:52:32,420
Go weirdy.

807
00:52:32,420 --> 00:52:43,860
Please don't piss on, don't even fictionally piss on my map.

808
00:52:43,860 --> 00:52:50,900
As you're sort of approaching it, you can see that it has like a hole, like a slot for

809
00:52:50,900 --> 00:52:53,980
or stop fucking making those eyes.

810
00:52:53,980 --> 00:52:56,900
You know, a slot for--

811
00:52:56,900 --> 00:52:57,740
- That's what I'm talking about.

812
00:52:57,740 --> 00:53:00,740
- For a slit. - Ooh, a slot.

813
00:53:00,740 --> 00:53:04,300
- No, we've been doing this for a while now,

814
00:53:04,300 --> 00:53:07,380
and there's a lot of stuff I tolerate, but.

815
00:53:07,380 --> 00:53:10,100
- I see the slot and it triples my speed towards me.

816
00:53:10,100 --> 00:53:12,360
(laughing)

817
00:53:12,360 --> 00:53:14,140
- Yeah, so you guys have your movement,

818
00:53:14,140 --> 00:53:15,340
and you're all within range.

819
00:53:15,340 --> 00:53:20,340
I think you can do a movement and an action to get it in.

820
00:53:20,340 --> 00:53:27,340
and

821
00:53:27,340 --> 00:53:29,900
that have to go in things after this it's over

822
00:53:29,900 --> 00:53:33,940
so very have a dirty mind that you don't have a fuckin night well i was gonna put

823
00:53:33,940 --> 00:53:37,660
a quarter-pound quirky and kinky and quirky i was gonna put my quarter inch

824
00:53:37,660 --> 00:53:38,660
urin there

825
00:53:38,660 --> 00:53:39,940
manhattan

826
00:53:39,940 --> 00:53:44,060
that's great you got a criminally small dick that's right you and one-quarter

827
00:53:44,060 --> 00:53:45,660

00:53:45,660 --> 00:53:47,460
she's come on

829
00:53:47,460 --> 00:53:50,100
patel exactly two-quarters of an inch or

830
00:53:50,100 --> 00:53:52,140
that's what you guys want to

831
00:53:52,140 --> 00:53:54,660
uh... it seems like i'm gonna die

832
00:53:54,660 --> 00:53:57,160
So I'm gonna play dead again.

833
00:53:57,160 --> 00:53:58,760
You're gonna try to play dead again?

834
00:53:58,760 --> 00:54:01,860
Yep, and I'm rolling a performance check right now and I got a crit one.

835
00:54:01,860 --> 00:54:02,860
[Laughter]

836
00:54:02,860 --> 00:54:03,860
So...

837
00:54:03,860 --> 00:54:05,360
Yeah, what does that look like?

838
00:54:05,360 --> 00:54:11,860
I'm more alive than... I accidentally take a Vyvanse and I'm just like hopping around.

839
00:54:11,860 --> 00:54:15,360
Hey, you guys want to watch a movie? Let's watch a movie.

840
00:54:15,360 --> 00:54:18,360
You paint a target on your stomach.

841
00:54:18,360 --> 00:54:19,360
[Laughter]

842
00:54:19,360 --> 00:54:20,360
Come and get me, Gabe.

843
00:54:20,360 --> 00:54:21,360
[Laughter]

844
00:54:22,860 --> 00:54:27,580
That's your action. I'm gonna say you still have a chance where it's like that didn't work and you could run

845
00:54:27,580 --> 00:54:31,060
Okay, so I will do that now do your and I will run

846
00:54:31,060 --> 00:54:33,780
I'm about to outsmart him

847
00:54:33,780 --> 00:54:38,600
Okay, so everyone else what are you doing? I go to the right of him

848
00:54:38,600 --> 00:54:42,500
So

849
00:54:42,500 --> 00:54:46,380
Obviously, it's an acid pool right? That's right. So

850
00:54:50,100 --> 00:54:52,460
It doesn't none of I don't get any more

851
00:54:52,460 --> 00:55:00,040
Like the fog doesn't clear up. Oh, sorry. Yeah, I thought I did that. Yeah, I didn't see where the pedestal is. Okay

852
00:55:00,040 --> 00:55:07,360
Yes, you could see it and you could see this you could see that it's like so if I touch the acid does it hurt

853
00:55:07,360 --> 00:55:08,300
me

854
00:55:08,300 --> 00:55:11,660
You could try you find out. No, I'm just I'm asking

855
00:55:11,660 --> 00:55:17,780
Eyeballing it you're like this would hurt me. Okay, so I get on my hoverboard, but you're green and it's green

856
00:55:18,820 --> 00:55:24,740
Yeah, regardless I get on my hoverboard because this is exactly I used to skate around the swamps of Succo Focobar

857
00:55:24,740 --> 00:55:29,920
Hell yeah, this is second nature to me do an athletics check. It's not too hard to pass. It's a good move

858
00:55:29,920 --> 00:55:38,940
Wow

859
00:55:38,940 --> 00:55:46,640
And classic classic Patrick Yoda fashion. I step on the hoverboard too soon and I just start spinning in a circle you

860
00:55:47,260 --> 00:55:48,500
let's do that

861
00:55:48,500 --> 00:55:51,120
the hoverboard flies away from you it is

862
00:55:51,120 --> 00:55:55,280
now on like the pedestals area

863
00:55:55,280 --> 00:55:58,960
it is now like it like slung out from under you kind of thing

864
00:55:58,960 --> 00:56:01,760
and just like glided towards the pedestal

865
00:56:01,760 --> 00:56:05,720
so now the pedestal which is on that little stone island of that lake of

866
00:56:05,720 --> 00:56:07,420
acid

867
00:56:07,420 --> 00:56:11,600
that's where the hoverboard is instead of with you. ok then i haven't used my movement yet

868
00:56:11,600 --> 00:56:12,600
so i'm just gonna

869
00:56:12,600 --> 00:56:14,640
i'm just gonna try and

870
00:56:14,640 --> 00:56:16,160
get to it

871
00:56:16,160 --> 00:56:31,160
you

872
00:56:31,160 --> 00:56:36,920
kick off of this wall, but half of you is kind of falling into this acid now.

873
00:56:36,920 --> 00:56:38,320
My toes are touching it?

874
00:56:38,320 --> 00:56:42,040
Yeah, your, your, your, your, your leggies, your little leggies are.

875
00:56:42,040 --> 00:56:43,040
Oh, no.

876
00:56:43,040 --> 00:56:44,040
Um, so...

877
00:56:44,040 --> 00:56:48,760
Would it count as a movement if while I jump I throw the thing onto the pedestal?

878
00:56:48,760 --> 00:56:51,880
No, because you already kind of did the hoverboard action, so...

879
00:56:51,880 --> 00:56:52,880
Okay.

880
00:56:52,880 --> 00:56:56,440
Yeah, so you're, you take like 11 damage in the acid...

881
00:56:56,440 --> 00:56:57,440
No!

882
00:56:57,440 --> 00:57:01,440
you up as you crawl onto the stone pedestal area.

883
00:57:01,440 --> 00:57:05,440
But you're there. So you can definitely put that in

884
00:57:05,440 --> 00:57:09,440
like next turn you would be able to put that in. Sullivan, meanwhile,

885
00:57:09,440 --> 00:57:13,440
is going to approach this sand area here.

886
00:57:13,440 --> 00:57:17,440
And as he does, it of course

887
00:57:17,440 --> 00:57:21,440
starts to sink. No!

888
00:57:21,440 --> 00:57:25,440
And so our young man is like, "Oh God!"

889
00:57:25,440 --> 00:57:27,440
but the little gamer's there to help him, right?

890
00:57:27,440 --> 00:57:32,140
Mm-hmm. That's what he's there for. Okay, so Sullivan is gonna roll a

891
00:57:32,140 --> 00:57:38,040
Yeah, it's really an athletics to try to or strength really a straight strength check

892
00:57:38,040 --> 00:57:40,640
See if you can deal with it

893
00:57:40,640 --> 00:57:44,320
Nine is pretty bad. He is sinking into this thing

894
00:57:44,320 --> 00:57:49,480
He's got a couple more tries before he sinks in this quicksand. He sees like halfway down

895
00:57:49,480 --> 00:57:53,680
There's like oh no my pants lose bottoms and you see the little gamer

896
00:57:53,680 --> 00:57:55,840
starts

897
00:57:55,840 --> 00:57:58,840
He starts bounding over to give Solven a hand.

898
00:57:58,840 --> 00:58:04,840
So, next turn, Solven's going to try again, and the gamer's going to be there to assist,

899
00:58:04,840 --> 00:58:06,840
give him an assist on the Strength check.

900
00:58:06,840 --> 00:58:10,840
Though the gamer's also going to have to resist this quicksand now, too.

901
00:58:10,840 --> 00:58:12,840
So the gamer's like...

902
00:58:12,840 --> 00:58:18,840
The gamer's like running on the sand, and he's like sort of slowly sinking in with each step a little bit.

903
00:58:18,840 --> 00:58:23,840
He doesn't want this to be another Artax situation, he's getting very distressed.

904
00:58:23,840 --> 00:58:25,840
Um

905
00:58:25,840 --> 00:58:29,280
But he's also sinking in too he actually did not do great on that athletics check

906
00:58:29,280 --> 00:58:33,200
So they're both kind of sinking in but they're going to try to hoist each other out next turn

907
00:58:33,200 --> 00:58:39,840
Now blow toss piss. What are you thinking? You're by this ice area. It's freaking freaking cold around you, man

908
00:58:39,840 --> 00:58:44,800
Yeah, so I can move within five feet of the pedestal. Um, so i'm not right next to it

909
00:58:44,800 --> 00:58:47,840
So I see i can't get the thing in from yeah

910
00:58:47,840 --> 00:58:51,360
Roll another athletics check because you have to like go back more on the ice. All right

911
00:58:51,840 --> 00:58:59,040
And with advantage again, because you're you're a frosty boy. Oh, you're fine five. Yeah, whatever you get you're fucking fine. All right

912
00:58:59,040 --> 00:59:01,200
um

913
00:59:01,200 --> 00:59:03,200
Can I toss the thing onto the pedestal?

914
00:59:03,200 --> 00:59:05,760
You can try it's gonna be hard

915
00:59:05,760 --> 00:59:07,680
um

916
00:59:07,680 --> 00:59:11,840
Hmm, I probably won't do that then i'll probably just wait till next turn. Yeah, I could also try it

917
00:59:11,840 --> 00:59:17,760
Sorry, yeah, what is what can I say? You can see that the stones are glowing now super bright like you're at the right place

918
00:59:17,760 --> 00:59:19,360
All right

919
00:59:19,360 --> 00:59:23,200
yours ray william johnson has gotten dimmer as you moved away obviously

920
00:59:23,200 --> 00:59:24,600
uh...

921
00:59:24,600 --> 00:59:27,800
on the try to shoot at the dome again just as i have an extra action

922
00:59:27,800 --> 00:59:29,040
yeah go for it

923
00:59:29,040 --> 00:59:30,640
fifteen

924
00:59:30,640 --> 00:59:34,860
that's pretty good you start to see that it's it's it's a little bit more

925
00:59:34,860 --> 00:59:37,440
it's getting something something's getting there

926
00:59:37,440 --> 00:59:39,680
as the damage stack

927
00:59:39,680 --> 00:59:43,640
uh... the attacks don't necessarily stack unless it's like he does like a few

928
00:59:43,640 --> 00:59:46,240
impressive roles in a row but i would probably

929
00:59:46,240 --> 00:59:47,440
let that stack

930
00:59:47,440 --> 00:59:48,720
but uh...

931
00:59:48,720 --> 00:59:52,560
But right now you can see that like he's getting somewhere the gamers aren't noticing it either

932
00:59:52,560 --> 00:59:55,760
They're just rabid and shouting and gaming and pushing each other

933
00:59:55,760 --> 00:59:57,200
um

934
00:59:57,200 --> 00:59:58,400
meanwhile

935
00:59:58,400 --> 01:00:00,080
Gaben is here

936
01:00:00,080 --> 01:00:02,080
so gaben like

937
01:00:02,080 --> 01:00:09,200
Like sort of like fucking like creepily like moving robotically towards you ray william johnson. Okay, so i'm being attacked by gabe newell

938
01:00:09,200 --> 01:00:14,480
And yeah, he's not being attacked roll dexterity saving throw. You can't do that trick on me again

939
01:00:17,100 --> 01:00:19,100
Dexterity saving throw

940
01:00:19,100 --> 01:00:24,540
14 that's not very good. It's it's it's it's a it's okay

941
01:00:24,540 --> 01:00:30,980
So he goes to bite you there's a couple of tiers of attack that he does. It's all mouth based

942
01:00:30,980 --> 01:00:38,700
He goes to chop at you and you're able to sort of like dodge back like sort of like just jump back a little bit

943
01:00:38,700 --> 01:00:40,700
mm-hmm, but as he's like

944
01:00:41,300 --> 01:00:44,700
chomping down he like whips his tongue out a bit like

945
01:00:44,700 --> 01:00:47,260
and just like

946
01:00:47,260 --> 01:00:49,820
Licks you with this massive tongue

947
01:00:49,820 --> 01:00:54,840
He's like this giant head with this tiny body and this massive tongue just like

948
01:00:54,840 --> 01:00:57,580
whomps you in the chest for

949
01:00:57,580 --> 01:01:07,220
Think I'm dead again. I've damage. Oh, I'm alive. Yeah, you missed the the

950
01:01:07,740 --> 01:01:09,740
the

951
01:01:09,740 --> 01:01:11,740
the

952
01:01:11,740 --> 01:01:13,740
the

953
01:01:13,740 --> 01:01:15,740
the

954
01:01:15,740 --> 01:01:17,740
the

955
01:01:17,740 --> 01:01:19,740
the

956
01:01:19,740 --> 01:01:21,740
the

957
01:01:21,740 --> 01:01:23,740
the

958
01:01:23,740 --> 01:01:25,740
the

959
01:01:25,740 --> 01:01:27,740
the

960
01:01:27,740 --> 01:01:29,740
the

961
01:01:29,740 --> 01:01:31,740
the

962
01:01:31,740 --> 01:01:33,740
the

963
01:01:33,740 --> 01:01:35,740
the

964
01:01:35,740 --> 01:01:39,440
around you sink into the ground.

965
01:01:39,440 --> 01:01:43,240
You see it fall into the amorphous sort of sea below you

966
01:01:43,240 --> 01:01:46,440
and dissipate and you're free to move.

967
01:01:46,440 --> 01:01:48,140
- Okay.

968
01:01:48,140 --> 01:01:53,280
How many movements can I make now?

969
01:01:53,280 --> 01:01:56,560
- It's still gonna be 15.

970
01:01:56,560 --> 01:01:59,060
- Okay, I'm gonna go, let me see.

971
01:01:59,060 --> 01:01:59,980
I'll go here.

972
01:01:59,980 --> 01:02:01,400
- Do it.

973
01:02:01,400 --> 01:02:02,560
Yeah.

974
01:02:02,560 --> 01:02:06,080
Now, I'm gonna have Sullivan and the little gamer,

975
01:02:06,080 --> 01:02:07,920
they're gonna try to help each other out here.

976
01:02:07,920 --> 01:02:09,800
So they're both kind of halfway sunk in.

977
01:02:09,800 --> 01:02:12,440
So it's a strength saving throw with advantage,

978
01:02:12,440 --> 01:02:16,720
but they take a bit of a penalty.

979
01:02:16,720 --> 01:02:18,300
Okay, it's not too bad though.

980
01:02:18,300 --> 01:02:19,920
They managed to hold their ground.

981
01:02:19,920 --> 01:02:21,320
They're like sort of holding each other up.

982
01:02:21,320 --> 01:02:22,640
Like Sullivan's like, "Aah!"

983
01:02:22,640 --> 01:02:23,920
The gamer's like, "Wah!"

984
01:02:23,920 --> 01:02:25,360
And they're just like holding each other up,

985
01:02:25,360 --> 01:02:27,440
making those sounds together in concert.

986
01:02:27,440 --> 01:02:31,120
But now it is your turn, Ray William Johnson.

987
01:02:31,120 --> 01:02:33,220
Gaben is in front of you.

988
01:02:33,220 --> 01:02:37,600
He looks nasty, mean, nasty.

989
01:02:37,600 --> 01:02:39,760
- And I'm covered in his tongue goo.

990
01:02:39,760 --> 01:02:41,480
- His nasty tongue goo, yeah.

991
01:02:41,480 --> 01:02:43,180
- Oh, and I hate it.

992
01:02:43,180 --> 01:02:51,800
If I don't do a movement, can I do a double action?

993
01:02:51,800 --> 01:02:55,240
- Yeah, I mean, you have two attacks you can do.

994
01:02:55,240 --> 01:02:57,440
So if you wanna do that, you can do that.

995
01:02:57,440 --> 01:03:00,080
- Okay, I think my, honestly, I feel like my best bet here

996
01:03:00,080 --> 01:03:13,080
is

997
01:03:13,080 --> 01:03:30,840
for

998
01:03:30,840 --> 01:03:36,620
Yeah, yeah that reaches the ceiling and you start to see a bit of the glass like

999
01:03:36,620 --> 01:03:39,280
Shadow, but start to fall

1000
01:03:39,280 --> 01:03:44,180
You have to roll dexterity saving throws as glass falls, but so does Gaben. Okay

1001
01:03:44,180 --> 01:03:51,340
15 that's fine. Yeah, you managed you broke the glass above you you broke the glass

1002
01:03:51,340 --> 01:03:54,620
Okay. Oh my god. I'm so good

1003
01:03:54,620 --> 01:04:00,240
So I mean not the only being on for women like you broke the glass a little bit but oh

1004
01:04:00,240 --> 01:04:07,240
all

1005
01:04:07,240 --> 01:04:25,240
the

1006
01:04:25,240 --> 01:04:27,240
going to happen to Gabe Newell?

1007
01:04:27,240 --> 01:04:29,240
No, no.

1008
01:04:29,240 --> 01:04:31,240
You're saying you're going to do this?

1009
01:04:31,240 --> 01:04:33,240
You're saying you're going to do this?

1010
01:04:33,240 --> 01:04:35,240
Unless he does something?

1011
01:04:35,240 --> 01:04:37,240
You're saying that when they crash into the glass ceiling, he's going to kill Gabe Newell?

1012
01:04:37,240 --> 01:04:39,240
No, I'm not saying anything

1013
01:04:39,240 --> 01:04:41,240
of the sort.

1014
01:04:41,240 --> 01:04:43,240
So, that's enough of that, right?

1015
01:04:43,240 --> 01:04:45,240
And you see him vanish back into the shadows.

1016
01:04:45,240 --> 01:04:49,240
He vanished back into the shadows

1017
01:04:49,240 --> 01:04:51,240
to hide for a second

1018
01:04:51,240 --> 01:04:53,240
and recharge, because that did enough damage to him

1019
01:04:53,240 --> 01:04:56,520
to have them want to go back into the shadows.

1020
01:04:56,520 --> 01:05:01,760
Yeah, but yeah, that was pretty smart.

1021
01:05:01,760 --> 01:05:03,960
You can still move too.

1022
01:05:03,960 --> 01:05:06,760
Were there gamers on that glass or no?

1023
01:05:06,760 --> 01:05:10,120
No, I mean like the gamers are like looking down on it,

1024
01:05:10,120 --> 01:05:14,080
but like they didn't fall through necessarily.

1025
01:05:14,080 --> 01:05:16,480
They like sort of saw that happen though.

1026
01:05:16,480 --> 01:05:20,840
So they're now a little bit more aware of like the side thing you're trying to do.

1027
01:05:20,840 --> 01:05:26,440
Okay, I'm gonna go over to the right. I can't see Gaben right now.

1028
01:05:26,440 --> 01:05:33,080
Mm-hmm. But I'm gonna move into this right here. Okay. Now, blow toss. Yeah, I'm

1029
01:05:33,080 --> 01:05:38,920
gonna take a step forward to get right next to the pedestal. Do I need to do

1030
01:05:38,920 --> 01:05:45,760
my athletics again? Cool. No, that was like five feet. Alright, yeah, then I put

1031
01:05:45,760 --> 01:05:51,360
the thing into the pedestal. Yeah, you see it go in there. It's it does a similar

1032
01:05:51,360 --> 01:05:58,660
thing. It sinks into the pedestal. You see the ice around you like like the heat. It

1033
01:05:58,660 --> 01:06:03,760
starts to get a bit warmer around you and then suddenly it's normal temperature.

1034
01:06:03,760 --> 01:06:07,360
The ice is melted away and you can walk freely through. I should also say

1035
01:06:07,360 --> 01:06:11,960
about you go to the smell went away too around you. Nice. Since I only move

1036
01:06:11,960 --> 01:06:19,080
five feet can I move ten more feet? Uh yeah yes. Okay I'm gonna move I'm gonna move like go around

1037
01:06:19,080 --> 01:06:24,840
the back of the pedestal to try and get away from Gabe if he comes after me. Yeah okay that was a

1038
01:06:24,840 --> 01:06:30,520
good move because now that Gabe has been attacked and uh done enough damage done to him that he

1039
01:06:30,520 --> 01:06:41,080
resets he's coming for you actually. Uh oh. Yeah now again so Patch Kiyoto what do you want to do?

1040
01:06:41,080 --> 01:06:56,080
the

1041
01:06:56,080 --> 01:07:11,080
a

1042
01:07:11,080 --> 01:07:16,440
room area in the middle where the ghosts usually are in pac-man but something else is in there

1043
01:07:16,440 --> 01:07:19,800
if Caleb goes in there will he heal because that's where the ghosts heal

1044
01:07:19,800 --> 01:07:25,800
yeah there will be healing in there if you go in there but you have to get in there

1045
01:07:25,800 --> 01:07:27,800
whoa

1046
01:07:27,800 --> 01:07:29,800
that's where the door is

1047
01:07:29,800 --> 01:07:31,800
oh shit

1048
01:07:31,800 --> 01:07:35,800
ok I'm gonna throw my gem to what's his name

1049
01:07:35,800 --> 01:07:39,800
go deep

1050
01:07:39,800 --> 01:07:43,800
25 feet. Yeah, athletics check. That shouldn't be too tough.

1051
01:07:43,800 --> 01:07:47,800
Oh, do it. Ike. And then I just fucking toss it, dude.

1052
01:07:47,800 --> 01:07:51,800
Athletics check, you said? Yeah, but it's not too hard. This'll be easy.

1053
01:07:51,800 --> 01:07:55,800
20. Ooh, perfect. That was close.

1054
01:07:55,800 --> 01:07:59,800
Because last time something wasn't too hard, something awful happened.

1055
01:07:59,800 --> 01:08:03,800
So, that's fine, though. Just beam him. Yeah, you just

1056
01:08:03,800 --> 01:08:07,800
knock him out cold. I throw it too well. Yeah, when someone throws you a football

1057
01:08:07,800 --> 01:08:14,800
the

1058
01:08:14,800 --> 01:08:18,320
So, uh, cool. That was your action. That was nice. You still have a movement you can do.

1059
01:08:18,320 --> 01:08:20,800
Move into the fucking thing with the...

1060
01:08:20,800 --> 01:08:23,440
What? The door's closed, dumbass. We're trying to open that door.

1061
01:08:23,440 --> 01:08:24,800
Open it! Go help Sullivan.

1062
01:08:24,800 --> 01:08:29,680
Johnson, when you look at the door, you can see now that the ice is glowing on the door,

1063
01:08:29,680 --> 01:08:33,920
like the ice emblem, and the acid emblem is glowing too.

1064
01:08:33,920 --> 01:08:35,920
Okay, then yeah, go help Sullivan.

1065
01:08:35,920 --> 01:08:39,520
Instead of helping him,

1066
01:08:41,360 --> 01:08:45,920
I am looking at my inventory and I guess I still have my huge worm.

1067
01:08:45,920 --> 01:08:48,360
Yeah, I guess I keep giving that to you.

1068
01:08:48,360 --> 01:08:51,880
Okay, so this time it's actually going to leave my inventory and I'm going to...

1069
01:08:51,880 --> 01:08:52,880
It's okay, man.

1070
01:08:52,880 --> 01:08:58,760
Since I just beamed Pat so well, instead of moving, I'm going to try and throw my worm

1071
01:08:58,760 --> 01:08:59,760
at Gaben.

1072
01:08:59,760 --> 01:09:00,760
Okay.

1073
01:09:00,760 --> 01:09:04,040
You're going to try to entice him with a big worm?

1074
01:09:04,040 --> 01:09:06,520
Or just annoy him a little bit.

1075
01:09:06,520 --> 01:09:08,080
Okay, go for it.

1076
01:09:08,080 --> 01:09:09,760
So another athletics check?

1077
01:09:09,760 --> 01:09:10,760
Yes.

1078
01:09:10,760 --> 01:09:14,260
Okay, I'm about to catch this worm, Gavin. 14.

1079
01:09:14,260 --> 01:09:18,260
Uh, yeah, you throw the worm, it kind of lands like over here.

1080
01:09:18,260 --> 01:09:20,260
It's huge, by the way.

1081
01:09:20,260 --> 01:09:24,260
It is huge, so I'm gonna roll to see if he's distracted by it.

1082
01:09:24,260 --> 01:09:26,260
Do a little wisdom check for him.

1083
01:09:26,260 --> 01:09:28,260
Gotta crit one.

1084
01:09:28,260 --> 01:09:30,260
Ooh, not wise enough for this worm.

1085
01:09:30,260 --> 01:09:32,260
Goddammit. I hate this fucking game.

1086
01:09:32,260 --> 01:09:34,260
It's too easy to beat you, dude.

1087
01:09:34,260 --> 01:09:36,260
So he...

1088
01:09:36,260 --> 01:09:38,260
He is...

1089
01:09:38,260 --> 01:09:45,260
Why this like worm is like a fucking menace to me.

1090
01:09:45,260 --> 01:09:51,540
I was like oh this will be a wisdom check, I'll throw him a bone, he'll do a wisdom check,

1091
01:09:51,540 --> 01:09:52,540
he probably won't.

1092
01:09:52,540 --> 01:09:56,780
And he gets a fucking one.

1093
01:09:56,780 --> 01:10:01,860
As soon as he, as soon as Gavin is like visually distracted, I like to get the worm back in

1094
01:10:01,860 --> 01:10:07,380
my inventory, I like get on my knees and start patting him, come here boy, come back to papa,

1095
01:10:07,380 --> 01:10:08,880
I'm gonna need you again later.

1096
01:10:08,880 --> 01:10:09,680
Okay,

1097
01:10:09,680 --> 01:10:11,380
you see the worms like

1098
01:10:11,380 --> 01:10:16,180
like like the Spongebob worm where it's like a dog and it

1099
01:10:16,180 --> 01:10:17,280
like, yeah,

1100
01:10:17,280 --> 01:10:19,480
it's at the rush up towards you.

1101
01:10:19,480 --> 01:10:20,980
You see Gaben's like we're

1102
01:10:20,980 --> 01:10:23,480
he starts to try to follow it.

1103
01:10:23,480 --> 01:10:29,480
I'll give you a chance to do something about that.

1104
01:10:29,480 --> 01:10:34,880
Papa Papa's over there actually and I point over to Sullivan.

1105
01:10:34,880 --> 01:10:54,880
I

1106
01:10:54,880 --> 01:11:01,880
the

1107
01:11:01,880 --> 01:11:06,380
Okay, it starts to sink, it's like halfway sinking.

1108
01:11:06,380 --> 01:11:08,380
It's like...

1109
01:11:08,380 --> 01:11:10,380
Will Gaben follow it?

1110
01:11:10,380 --> 01:11:12,380
No, Gaben's just like watching it sink.

1111
01:11:12,380 --> 01:11:14,380
He's like...

1112
01:11:14,380 --> 01:11:16,380
But if we get him into the sand, will he sink?

1113
01:11:16,380 --> 01:11:18,380
Uh, Gaben? Maybe.

1114
01:11:18,380 --> 01:11:22,380
If you put Gaben in the sand, what do you think would happen to him?

1115
01:11:22,380 --> 01:11:24,380
I think he would get halfway stuck.

1116
01:11:24,380 --> 01:11:26,380
Yeah, me too.

1117
01:11:26,380 --> 01:11:28,380
That's fun.

1118
01:11:28,380 --> 01:11:30,380
So, um...

1119
01:11:30,380 --> 01:11:45,380
a

1120
01:11:45,380 --> 01:11:50,020
No, it's just halfway sinking. It's still there. All right, so Sullivan sees Gabe and he's like

1121
01:11:50,020 --> 01:11:53,700
Like the baby gamer the little gamers

1122
01:11:53,700 --> 01:12:00,900
Let's see how they do they try to help each other out again nice. Yeah, they're able to get themselves out

1123
01:12:00,900 --> 01:12:07,460
And the the and Sullivan starts to move he moves he manages to move like five feet up here

1124
01:12:07,460 --> 01:12:09,940
uh the little gamer

1125
01:12:09,940 --> 01:12:13,220
Uh follows in tow to try to continue to help Sullivan

1126
01:12:13,860 --> 01:12:18,420
uh... and now it is your turn still but what i see the last one ago to skin can

1127
01:12:18,420 --> 01:12:19,420
already went

1128
01:12:19,420 --> 01:12:21,160
yet that were in tactic

1129
01:12:21,160 --> 01:12:22,900
on johnson

1130
01:12:22,900 --> 01:12:24,420
i'll move

1131
01:12:24,420 --> 01:12:26,700
towards the sand area

1132
01:12:26,700 --> 01:12:28,080
uh...

1133
01:12:28,080 --> 01:12:31,480
kit do i see it can i get as my vision clear up at all

1134
01:12:31,480 --> 01:12:34,580
yes sorry we do that for you c_n_n_'s are to see a little bit more of

1135
01:12:34,580 --> 01:12:35,820
everything uh...

1136
01:12:35,820 --> 01:12:39,460
yes it also say that like the vision around the the vision around these areas

1137
01:12:39,460 --> 01:12:43,380
should like it like a much brighter now because once you clear it up

1138
01:12:43,380 --> 01:12:47,500
can i see gave been over these little of the stone creates a greenish glow

1139
01:12:47,500 --> 01:12:52,300
around this corner of bluish glow around the ice corner

1140
01:12:52,300 --> 01:12:56,300
can i see a bit of an over the walls as he taller than the walls

1141
01:12:56,300 --> 01:12:57,540
uh... you could

1142
01:12:57,540 --> 01:13:01,700
maybe see a tough to pair a little bit but not really it's a hard the walls

1143
01:13:01,700 --> 01:13:03,460
are really a plan to say

1144
01:13:03,460 --> 01:13:05,540
ten feet tall you can link you collect

1145
01:13:05,540 --> 01:13:06,780
s like

1146
01:13:06,780 --> 01:13:10,420
do a little scale a little bit like get a little bit i'd over and look at c_n_n_

1147
01:13:10,420 --> 01:13:12,100
but not really don't really have line of sight. No.

1148
01:13:12,100 --> 01:13:17,980
Hmm. How, if I scale, if I scale, instead of moving,

1149
01:13:17,980 --> 01:13:22,020
if I scale the wall instead of moving, that'll give me a line of sight, right?

1150
01:13:22,020 --> 01:13:27,540
Yeah. Okay. Can I do that then? Um, okay. Instead of moving. Yeah.

1151
01:13:27,540 --> 01:13:32,220
Yeah. Let you do that. All right. Yeah. So I'm do, uh,

1152
01:13:32,220 --> 01:13:34,860
do an athletics check. Cause this is sort of like, just like, you know,

1153
01:13:34,860 --> 01:13:38,180
smooth stone. Yeah. 10.

1154
01:13:39,900 --> 01:13:43,340
I'd say you're able to climb and you're able to kind of look over it.

1155
01:13:43,340 --> 01:13:45,580
So you're gonna have disadvantage on your shot.

1156
01:13:45,580 --> 01:13:46,540
Okay.

1157
01:13:46,540 --> 01:13:47,580
Yeah.

1158
01:13:47,580 --> 01:13:48,940
Um, hmm.

1159
01:13:48,940 --> 01:13:51,900
Can I see the ground around him?

1160
01:13:51,900 --> 01:13:54,220
Not really.

1161
01:13:54,220 --> 01:13:55,980
All right, I'll shoot. I'll try to shoot him.

1162
01:13:55,980 --> 01:13:56,700
Yeah, go for it.

1163
01:13:56,700 --> 01:13:57,420
Disadvantage.

1164
01:13:57,420 --> 01:13:57,660
Yeah.

1165
01:13:57,660 --> 01:13:59,340
Nine.

1166
01:13:59,340 --> 01:14:02,940
Okay, yeah. It's, uh, it goes a little bit wide. You have another shot.

1167
01:14:02,940 --> 01:14:07,180
All right, I'm gonna try again. I still have disadvantage, right?

1168
01:14:07,180 --> 01:14:07,820
Yeah.

1169
01:14:07,820 --> 01:14:08,540
Oh!

1170
01:14:08,540 --> 01:14:09,340
17.

1171
01:14:09,340 --> 01:14:10,460
that hits

1172
01:14:10,460 --> 01:14:11,660
well for damage

1173
01:14:11,660 --> 01:14:12,620
three

1174
01:14:12,620 --> 01:14:14,280
nice yeah uh...

1175
01:14:14,280 --> 01:14:17,900
uh... the bullet was seventeen just barely hits it grazes the top of his

1176
01:14:17,900 --> 01:14:18,900
head

1177
01:14:18,900 --> 01:14:22,700
is really unlike sort of faces you for a second

1178
01:14:22,700 --> 01:14:23,740
uh...

1179
01:14:23,740 --> 01:14:25,260
uh...

1180
01:14:25,260 --> 01:14:28,540
uh... you know he was sort of intrigued by the word now it's a little

1181
01:14:28,540 --> 01:14:30,860
little angered by the uh...

1182
01:14:30,860 --> 01:14:32,860
he's a little bit

1183
01:14:32,860 --> 01:14:35,900
and he's like sort of looking towards you a little bit uh...

1184
01:14:35,900 --> 01:14:37,340
but now it's a nice round

1185
01:14:37,340 --> 01:14:38,340
again

1186
01:14:38,340 --> 01:14:42,580
uh... this time gable go last again just because now he sort of in this like

1187
01:14:42,580 --> 01:14:45,380
spot where he's like kind of close to

1188
01:14:45,380 --> 01:14:46,380
solvent

1189
01:14:46,380 --> 01:14:47,700
uh...

1190
01:14:47,700 --> 01:14:51,020
but i a f first patrick you know it's let's get you going to write i'm just

1191
01:14:51,020 --> 01:14:51,660
gonna

1192
01:14:51,660 --> 01:14:52,760
he moved out

1193
01:14:52,760 --> 01:14:56,700
the acute move it was a lot of uh... uh... makes all sense to me

1194
01:14:56,700 --> 01:14:57,900
uh...

1195
01:14:57,900 --> 01:15:00,100
uh... rewind on somebody wanted

1196
01:15:00,100 --> 01:15:04,640
i would like to stealthily trying hide opposite the wall that

1197
01:15:04,640 --> 01:15:06,340
that gave in his uh...

1198
01:15:06,340 --> 01:15:13,240
Mind okay right here. Perfect. I try quiet enough that he can't he doesn't on their role stealth role

1199
01:15:13,240 --> 01:15:15,460
Okay easy for me

1200
01:15:15,460 --> 01:15:17,820
Mm-hmm and

1201
01:15:17,820 --> 01:15:22,920
A 17. Yeah, great. I mean like he's pretty you know, there's a giant worm. There's a delicious frog

1202
01:15:22,920 --> 01:15:27,140
There's a gun being shot at him. So with a 17, yeah, you're pretty much

1203
01:15:27,140 --> 01:15:29,740
You're not on his radar now. Yes

1204
01:15:29,740 --> 01:15:32,100
You're you're you're hidden

1205
01:15:33,700 --> 01:15:36,660
Sullivan and the little gamer make it to the pedestal

1206
01:15:36,660 --> 01:15:40,740
And they put the sandstone in the sand goes around away

1207
01:15:40,740 --> 01:15:44,020
Which means it's easier to move through it. Uh-oh

1208
01:15:44,020 --> 01:15:50,900
Um, gavin's gonna kill him my worm back. Sullivan's like, oh, yeah, you see the worm like flopping around on the ground

1209
01:15:50,900 --> 01:15:52,980
um

1210
01:15:52,980 --> 01:15:55,700
Uh, sullivan sort of moves into the corner a bit

1211
01:15:55,700 --> 01:16:00,340
The little gamer also they're sort of uh after putting it in they sort of like firm up there

1212
01:16:00,740 --> 01:16:03,740
like kind of been like a we'll figure out what to do when he comes for us.

1213
01:16:03,740 --> 01:16:04,440
Okay.

1214
01:16:04,440 --> 01:16:06,840
Back to back.

1215
01:16:06,840 --> 01:16:08,740
Worm, come here.

1216
01:16:08,740 --> 01:16:10,540
Oh, come here.

1217
01:16:10,540 --> 01:16:11,040
Come here.

1218
01:16:11,040 --> 01:16:12,240
Don't put my backpack.

1219
01:16:12,240 --> 01:16:12,940
Yeah.

1220
01:16:12,940 --> 01:16:15,240
I'll let you do that.

1221
01:16:15,240 --> 01:16:16,340
Yes, he doesn't hear it.

1222
01:16:16,340 --> 01:16:19,340
But roll, you have to roll a, you have to roll stealth, you have to roll

1223
01:16:19,340 --> 01:16:22,540
persuasion because I'm because you're kind of out of turn order, but I want

1224
01:16:22,540 --> 01:16:25,440
you to do that because I like that idea of the worm as a slur.

1225
01:16:25,440 --> 01:16:26,340
Stealth.

1226
01:16:26,340 --> 01:16:27,240
Nice.

1227
01:16:27,240 --> 01:16:29,240
Okay, so you're quiet enough.

1228
01:16:29,240 --> 01:16:30,340
Persuasion.

1229
01:16:30,340 --> 01:16:36,580
Mm-hmm six. Oh, yeah the worm the worm like is like like just looking at you like how a dog

1230
01:16:36,580 --> 01:16:39,180
What you'll be like come here come here. They just like look at you

1231
01:16:39,180 --> 01:16:41,700
Why didn't I teach him how to speak?

1232
01:16:41,700 --> 01:16:45,780
And you're like, why are you just looking at me um

1233
01:16:45,780 --> 01:16:48,980
Botox piss, okay. Mm-hmm

1234
01:16:48,980 --> 01:16:51,860
What's up? Am I on the wall now?

1235
01:16:51,860 --> 01:16:57,580
Have I you can use you can use like like a bit of your movement. You're on the wall. Like all right

1236
01:16:57,580 --> 01:16:59,580
Yeah, you can finish climbing up there

1237
01:16:59,580 --> 01:17:10,380
I'm just gonna I want Gabe and to come toward me. Okay, you solve it alone. So I'm gonna I'm gonna shoot him again and I'm gonna

1238
01:17:10,380 --> 01:17:13,180
I'll probably yell like a you know

1239
01:17:13,180 --> 01:17:19,320
Like a voice line from like the sniper from TF to like a thematic one if I could think of one I would so just like

1240
01:17:19,320 --> 01:17:21,820
Imagine I'm saying one of the voice. I'm imagining it. Yeah

1241
01:17:21,820 --> 01:17:29,020
What about thanks for standing still yeah, I'll say or like the one yeah something like that and like where that funny accent

1242
01:17:29,020 --> 01:17:34,020
he has. And that funny freaky accent that no real life person has.

1243
01:17:34,020 --> 01:17:40,900
Yeah, with that 11 though, it doesn't quite hit, it goes a bit wide. So you obviously

1244
01:17:40,900 --> 01:17:46,140
have another attack still though. Yeah, I'll try again. Oh, a 7, oh no.

1245
01:17:46,140 --> 01:17:52,420

Sullivan and the Little Gamer

1283
01:20:26,580 --> 01:20:28,580
"Ha, ha, ha!" like running out of there.

1284
01:20:28,580 --> 01:20:30,580
Okay, uh...

Your turn.

1287
01:20:33,420 --> 01:20:37,920
- I am gonna, 'cause I know Gaben is over here

1288
01:20:37,920 --> 01:20:42,920
in the shadows, so I'm going to try and run away really fast.

1289
01:20:42,920 --> 01:20:45,120
- Okay.

1290
01:20:45,120 --> 01:20:46,900
Go.

1291
01:20:46,900 --> 01:20:48,700
- So I'm gonna go here,

1292
01:20:48,700 --> 01:20:51,160
and I'm gonna get closer to the door.

1293
01:20:51,160 --> 01:20:52,860
- Okay, cool.

1294
01:20:52,860 --> 01:20:56,100
Yeah, you can see now, but the sand one is glowing as well,

01:21:00,780 --> 01:21:02,020
- Do I just move again?

1298
01:21:02,020 --> 01:21:06,500
yeah and i would say that this point like all that you sort of like

1299
01:21:06,500 --> 01:21:10,440
because enough of like this like slow movement i think it's fair to be like

1300
01:21:10,440 --> 01:21:12,860
you're kind of in within reach of the lava

1301
01:21:12,860 --> 01:21:15,020

01:21:57,420 --> 01:22:08,420
You start to sink into this lava. You take, you take five more damage as you are burning on this lava and it's going to make make your movement, you know, slower.

1319
01:22:08,420 --> 01:22:09,420
To heaven health now.

1320
01:22:09,420 --> 01:22:15,420
Yeah. I'm going to have Gaben go so you can sort of decide what you want to do, Blotas, based off that.

1321
01:22:15,420 --> 01:22:21,420
So what you see, Blotas, you're able to see this because of like where you are.

1322
01:22:21,420 --> 01:22:26,200
so reveal this a bit you see gaben go into this like bright light in the

01:23:06,540 --> 01:23:14,400
Yeah, athletics check or acrobatics, but it's not too hard for you. Yeah, I'm gonna do an athletics check go for it 26

1336
01:23:14,400 --> 01:23:17,840
Yeah, yeah, you look fucking sick, dude. Oh, yeah

1337
01:23:17,840 --> 01:23:24,540
It won't drag me onto it, right? No, it's not gonna drag you onto it. Perfect. All right, you're on. Okay? Yeah

1338
01:23:24,540 --> 01:23:27,660
So now I'm a little closer to Gabe in and towards the door

1339
01:23:27,660 --> 01:23:29,520
and

1340
01:23:29,520 --> 01:23:31,240
I'm just gonna try to shoot him again

1341
01:23:31,240 --> 01:23:31,440
Yeah

1342
01:23:31,440 --> 01:23:35,700
You have advantage because now that you have like a total line of sight of him and you're up above

1343
01:23:35,700 --> 01:23:41,120
And you're that close get you get advantage like you can't like be that high up and not get advantage on an attack

1344
01:23:41,120 --> 01:23:43,480
19 that hits for sure

1345
01:23:43,840 --> 01:23:51,580
Do damage seven damage? Yeah, you shoot that it gets to his fat fucking neck and he has the valve thing on the back

1346
01:23:51,580 --> 01:24:01,560
And he started to turn around a little bit and it scares me yeah, he turns around he looks like the

1347
01:24:01,560 --> 01:24:05,680
Yeah, he looks like the freaky witch

1348
01:24:10,400 --> 01:24:13,400
Mr. Freeman wake up, but he's just like yelling

1349
01:24:13,400 --> 01:24:20,360
In this dark deep bass baritone voice and you also look up we see the gamers now

1350
01:24:20,360 --> 01:24:25,440
They're looking a little bit more like they're stopping paying attention to their gaming and they're more gripped by this

1351
01:24:25,440 --> 01:24:30,700
Because you guys seem like you actually might fucking pull this off when you look up you have another attack, too

1352
01:24:30,700 --> 01:24:33,520
I'm gonna be gripping them soon enough. All right, tell you what?

1353
01:24:33,520 --> 01:24:35,980
I'm gonna attack him again

1354
01:24:35,980 --> 01:24:38,080
Go for 18

1355
01:24:38,080 --> 01:24:40,080
All right. Yeah that hits

1356
01:24:40,080 --> 01:24:42,080
10 damage.

1357
01:24:42,080 --> 01:24:47,320
yeah, that's that's enough where it's like he turned around and you just like fucking got him in the fucking eye and

1358
01:24:47,320 --> 01:24:50,200
He's like

1359
01:24:50,200 --> 01:24:53,640
I'm gonna reveal the whole fucking map to you guys at this point. Yes

1360
01:24:53,640 --> 01:25:00,860
So all of his all of his movements have disadvantage now. Yeah, that's right Patrick. No, you know Patrick is that

1361
01:25:00,860 --> 01:25:06,440
No, I'm sorry, yeah, that's me to me. No, it's not how that is

1362
01:25:06,440 --> 01:25:09,400
No, it's not quite cuz he kind of just like regens and just like retreats

1363
01:25:09,400 --> 01:25:14,620
All right, so that's kind of like imagine like his eye like blows up and then he just kind of like hides away

1364
01:25:14,620 --> 01:25:19,840
But now this time you can all see him like there's no fog anymore

1365
01:25:19,840 --> 01:25:24,300
He can't like disappear into the darkness like it's gone too far at this point

1366
01:25:24,300 --> 01:25:29,380
So you can see his eye starting to reform while you're drowning in the lava. You can kind of see that

1367
01:25:29,380 --> 01:25:32,200
happening

1368
01:25:32,200 --> 01:25:35,040
But yeah round restarts Patrick Yoda

1369
01:25:35,040 --> 01:25:38,460
Well, I gotta get to that fucking

1370
01:25:38,460 --> 01:25:55,200
in

1371
01:25:55,200 --> 01:26:09,180

01:26:42,540 --> 01:26:50,980

01:27:31,300 --> 01:27:32,300

It's like an elevator, it looks like.

1421
01:29:41,220 --> 01:29:45,960
And there's like one button and it just says "To the Gamer Room."

1422
01:29:45,960 --> 01:29:46,960
Okay.

1423
01:29:46,960 --> 01:29:48,960
So you're in there now.

1424
01:29:48,960 --> 01:29:53,920
Yeah, just kind of like looking at my watch and patiently waiting on my friends.

1425
01:29:53,920 --> 01:30:13,920

1433
01:30:38,920 --> 01:30:41,920
we're gonna like fast forward a bit

1434
01:30:41,920 --> 01:30:44,920
because it's really just gonna be Patrick Yoda and Gaben I think

1435
01:30:44,920 --> 01:30:47,920
everybody else is gonna be able to get into this safe zone over here

1436
01:30:47,920 --> 01:31:00,600
the

1437
01:31:00,600 --> 01:31:03,160
So go again, Patrick Yoda. Or go go blow it up first.

1438
01:31:03,160 --> 01:31:05,600
I'm just going to I'm going to shoot him again. Go for it.

1439
01:31:05,600 --> 01:31:09,800
Oops, I rolled three times back, but that's a 16.

1440
01:31:09,800 --> 01:31:13,640
OK, yeah, does not hit, but the 23 will hit.

1441
01:31:13,640 --> 01:31:18,080
So for that second attack, 10 damage.

1442
01:31:18,080 --> 01:31:22,120
Yeah, he's like hurt by that, but like he's still OK.

1443
01:31:22,120 --> 01:31:23,960
Patrick, you can move now.

1444
01:31:23,960 --> 01:31:27,280
OK, I run over here.

1445
01:31:27,760 --> 01:31:29,760
Okay, nice, okay.

01:31:37,120 --> 01:31:39,120
Yeah, that reaches his cap again.

1452
01:31:39,120 --> 01:31:40,800
And he, uh, retreats.

1453
01:31:40,800 --> 01:31:43,080
Let's go, we're safe.

1454
01:31:43,080 --> 01:31:46,080
Yeah, he retreats again, so you guys can all get into the elevator.

1455
01:31:46,080 --> 01:31:46,580
Yeah.

1456
01:31:46,580 --> 01:31:47,840
What the fuck took you so long?

01:31:47,840 --> 01:31:49,160
And we heal in the elevator?

1458
01:31:49,160 --> 01:31:50,800
Yeah, you're all gonna heal.

1459
01:31:50,800 --> 01:31:51,640
Yes.

1460
01:31:51,640 --> 01:31:54,160
You feel like this aura around you, like,

1461
01:31:54,160 --> 01:31:55,360
*mimics the aura*

1462
01:31:55,360 --> 01:31:57,320
Like you're coming back to life.

1463
01:31:57,320 --> 01:32:00,440
like you were a blue ghost that was eaten or something.

1464
01:32:00,440 --> 01:32:03,640
And you see that button that says "To the Gamer Room" and you see the little gamer who's like

1465
01:32:03,640 --> 01:32:04,640
"Why did you bring it?

1466
01:32:04,640 --> 01:32:05,640
Why did you bring it?"

1467
01:32:05,640 --> 01:32:06,640
pointing at the button.

1468
01:32:06,640 --> 01:32:10,280
He's saying "Don't press it."

1469
01:32:10,280 --> 01:32:13,200
He's saying "Guys, I understand him."

1470
01:32:13,200 --> 01:32:18,040
He's saying "Under no circumstances would you ever touch this button."

1471
01:32:18,040 --> 01:32:19,040
Yeah, fuck that little kid.

1472
01:32:19,040 --> 01:32:26,800
Yeah, the little gamer runs up to the button and slams his head on it, like just in frustration.

1473
01:32:26,800 --> 01:32:31,360
And yeah, you hear this elevator going up, this chute.

1474
01:32:31,360 --> 01:32:36,960
You see the other gamers in the land, who were having that land party, watching you all,

1475
01:32:36,960 --> 01:32:41,800
like kind of in awe, for beating the Gaben.

1476
01:32:41,800 --> 01:32:43,760
You go up, actually, and...
