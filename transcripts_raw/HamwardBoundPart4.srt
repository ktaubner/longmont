1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,580
(upbeat music)

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:15,000
- So last time on a Hamward Bound,

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,960
which is just becoming less and less

4
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:21,260
like the source material it was based off of.

5
00:00:21,260 --> 00:00:27,720
You guys bested ManBearPig using your sheer wit.

6
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:28,820
- Easy.

7
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:32,160
and seriously unfortunate roles on my end

8
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:37,020
uh... you drove the bus to to a creek where you beat up the c_i_a_

9
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:38,180
uh...

10
00:00:38,180 --> 00:00:44,580
you weekend at bernie dick vandyke to get my ride stole from seven eleven

11
00:00:44,580 --> 00:00:49,060
and you made your way to dilute minnesota finally

12
00:00:49,060 --> 00:00:49,580
beat up

13
00:00:49,580 --> 00:00:51,220
mister graham dan dog

14
00:00:51,220 --> 00:00:54,940
and skeletal words and fed him to fed them to me and their

15
00:00:54,940 --> 00:00:56,340
then left me

16
00:00:56,340 --> 00:00:58,220
cryptic note

17
00:00:58,220 --> 00:01:06,540
about a candy hamster and then Pleasant Parrot had a strange sort of sensation like he did

18
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:10,900
in the first session.

19
00:01:10,900 --> 00:01:12,380
I heard a vampire speak to me.

20
00:01:12,380 --> 00:01:15,780
You heard a vampire talk to him.

21
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:20,900
And now you guys are trying to get into the concert without a ticket and you're three

22
00:01:20,900 --> 00:01:27,820
animals and so you get to the front of the line after walking for about thirty minutes.

23
00:01:27,820 --> 00:01:29,300
Can I do something real quick?

24
00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:30,300
Yeah.

25
00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:39,180
With some of the underwear that I had in my cheeks, I make t-shirts that say "service

26
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:40,180
animal."

27
00:01:40,180 --> 00:01:41,180
Okay.

28
00:01:41,180 --> 00:01:42,180
Oh.

29
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:46,700
That is the smartest thing you've ever done in a Dungeons and Dragons game.

30
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:48,340
I'll let you do that.

31
00:01:48,340 --> 00:01:49,340
Yeah.

32
00:01:49,340 --> 00:01:54,860
Okay, yeah, you make those t-shirts, you guys come up dressed as service animals, underwear

33
00:01:54,860 --> 00:01:56,900
service animals.

34
00:01:56,900 --> 00:01:58,460
Jafar Stadium comes into view.

35
00:01:58,460 --> 00:02:01,860
- Mine is like, mine is like, like black lace lingerie.

36
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:04,120
(laughing)

37
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:10,260
- And it looks like, exactly like the palace in Aladdin,

38
00:02:10,260 --> 00:02:15,100
except Jafar is a defense contractor based out of Duluth.

39
00:02:15,100 --> 00:02:17,860
So that's the name, why the stadium's named after it.

40
00:02:17,860 --> 00:02:21,060
When you reach the front of the line,

41
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:23,740
you see security's fairly stacked, electric fences,

42
00:02:23,740 --> 00:02:25,900
barring the entry, security guards

43
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:27,380
that have been patrolling up and down the line

44
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:28,520
as you've been walking.

45
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:33,860
And then machine gun turrets on top of the security

46
00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:37,340
sort of scanners, checkpoint scanners,

47
00:02:37,340 --> 00:02:39,600
which are designed to scan for not only

48
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:40,700
whether or not you are armed,

49
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:42,920
but if you have intent to harm stained.

50
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:47,220
- I feel that.

51
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:49,860
(laughing)

52
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:50,700
Just kidding.

53
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:53,220
- You don't see your family in line though.

54
00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:55,060
So they've probably already gotten in.

55
00:02:55,060 --> 00:02:57,060
Oh, yeah, that's what's

56
00:02:57,060 --> 00:03:00,440
Mm-hmm or yeah, or they missed the concert or whatever

57
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:03,600
They gotta be in there. Oh

58
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:06,220
Please let them be in there

59
00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:11,820
I feel like I could sniff them out feel like we're close enough

60
00:03:11,820 --> 00:03:18,900
Yeah, go for it. You could try it for I'm gonna use crime dog. Yeah do it. I'm gonna do investigation

61
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:22,660
I did insight last time but I didn't realize that negative one. So I'm gonna do investigation this time

62
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:29,540
16 nice. Yeah, and I hit a nice sniffer you catch the feints scent of a blagojevich

63
00:03:29,540 --> 00:03:32,660
About

64
00:03:32,660 --> 00:03:36,880
How much is a click a click is 1,000 light-years?

65
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:40,480
Okay, so about a point. Oh

66
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:47,700
Of a click of would just say one will say one click is one

67
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:52,780
Okay, really? Yeah, why do they say click?

68
00:03:52,780 --> 00:03:54,780
it's about .1

69
00:03:54,780 --> 00:03:56,780
[laughter]

70
00:03:56,780 --> 00:03:58,780
ok, it's slang

71
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:00,780
it says a click or more appropriately click

72
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:02,780
with a k

73
00:04:02,780 --> 00:04:04,780
is the slang or short term for one kilometer

74
00:04:04,780 --> 00:04:06,780
ok

75
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:08,780
about .1 clicks

76
00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:10,780
how many miles is a click?

77
00:04:10,780 --> 00:04:12,780
0

78
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:14,780
1 point something

79
00:04:14,780 --> 00:04:16,780
5/8ths of a mile

80
00:04:16,780 --> 00:04:18,780
a kilometer is 5/8ths of a mile

81
00:04:18,780 --> 00:04:20,780
a kilometer is smaller than a mile

82
00:04:20,780 --> 00:04:25,780
Yeah, Patches said there was more right then, like insinuated there was more and I like panicked.

83
00:04:25,780 --> 00:04:27,780
Like my entire world was upside down.

84
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:31,780
You can actually use the Fibonacci sequence to estimate how much...

85
00:04:31,780 --> 00:04:36,780
Oh, okay, shut up! Shut the fuck up, nerd! Shut the fuck up!

86
00:04:36,780 --> 00:04:38,780
It's pretty cool.

87
00:04:38,780 --> 00:04:41,780
Now that's pleasant parrot.

88
00:04:41,780 --> 00:04:43,780
Yeah, it's not pleasant.

89
00:04:43,780 --> 00:04:46,780
So yeah, you can sniff them. They are inside.

90
00:04:46,780 --> 00:04:47,780
Okay.

91
00:04:47,780 --> 00:04:51,780
Um, you can sniff, sniff out their, their cool...

92
00:04:51,780 --> 00:04:54,780
What does a Blagojevich smell like?

93
00:04:54,780 --> 00:04:56,780
Oh, you don't wanna know.

94
00:04:56,780 --> 00:04:57,780
Is it like the stink?

95
00:04:57,780 --> 00:05:02,780
It smells like malt liquor and, and Di Serrano and Draco Noir.

96
00:05:02,780 --> 00:05:03,780
Smells like stadium foreskin.

97
00:05:03,780 --> 00:05:04,780
Foreskin.

98
00:05:04,780 --> 00:05:05,780
Yeah.

99
00:05:05,780 --> 00:05:10,780
It smells like spraying Draco Noir in your foreskin.

100
00:05:10,780 --> 00:05:11,780
Yeah.

101
00:05:11,780 --> 00:05:15,780
Actually, everyone can smell it.

102
00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:17,460
everyone's walking around like others

103
00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:18,100

He could do whatever that's true.

Yeah, he likes parrots.

135
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:39,100
He doesn't like Iago the he but he likes parrots.

136
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:40,400
He just doesn't like that parrot.

137
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,400
it's a lot more if you read it

138
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:44,400
i should have read the book

139
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:46,400
you know that on sunwiki media

140
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:48,400

ok, what about you two?

147
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:02,400
i just start sniffing

148
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:04,400
sniffing fucking pussies and assholes

149
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:06,400
yeah i'm still doing

150
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:08,400
still doing cartwheels

151
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:10,900
I'm going behind every single person.

152
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:11,900
Yeah.

153
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:15,300
And then I also, you know what, I think I have some money in my inventory.

154
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:20,300
I hire a blind guy like for ten bucks to just every time somebody gets mad that I'm sniffing

155
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:21,300
their asshole.

156
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:23,500
Can I jump into a purse or something?

157
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:25,500
Okay, a couple things to resolve here.

158
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:28,420
No, you know what I do is I go to the front of the line.

159
00:07:28,420 --> 00:07:29,420
Okay.

160
00:07:29,420 --> 00:07:31,340
We're in the concert.

161
00:07:31,340 --> 00:07:32,340
We're in?

162
00:07:32,340 --> 00:07:36,140
No, you're in the line to get off the stadium.

163
00:07:36,140 --> 00:07:37,140
Oh, never mind.

164
00:07:37,140 --> 00:07:54,380
we

165
00:07:54,380 --> 00:07:55,380
What did you want to do as a dog?

166
00:07:55,380 --> 00:07:56,380
Um, I wanted to hire a blind guy.

167
00:07:56,380 --> 00:07:57,380
Is there any blind guys around?

168
00:07:57,380 --> 00:08:03,100
Roll an investigation to see if you can find a vision impaired individual.

169
00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:06,500
It's easy, you can tell just by looking at them.

170
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:07,500
Three.

171
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:09,060
Well, I guess I can't.

172
00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:13,300
Yeah, I mean you can see some guys that look fucked up, but you can't tell if they're blind

173
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:14,300
or not.

174
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:20,700
Okay, I walk up to every black guy with sunglasses on and I ask if they're blind.

175
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:21,700
Yeah, they all ask.

176
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:22,700
Oh fuck, I'm a dog!

177
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:23,300
dog.

178
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:28,300
So you just go up to black guys.

179
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:30,700
Jafari seems really friendly and not evil.

180
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:33,100
Now to resolve the hungry hamster thing.

181
00:08:33,100 --> 00:08:36,700

262
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:57,840

in you, Pleasant Parrot. And you start to feel your veins fill up

266
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:13,960
and get syrupy. You start to slowly drift off. Meanwhile, Hungry Hamster

00:16:09,540 --> 00:16:11,540
Let's do it with double advantage. How about that?

319
00:16:11,540 --> 00:16:13,540
It's not even a thing, really.

00:16:15,540 --> 00:16:18,540
We could make it a thing. I could roll like 6 d20s.

322
00:16:18,540 --> 00:16:21,540
You could also pull some items out, too.

323
00:16:21,540 --> 00:16:26,540
Oh, you know what? I do my famous dance in a place where everybody can see me.

324
00:16:26,540 --> 00:16:28,540
Where do you go to do that?

325
00:16:28,540 --> 00:16:31,540
I jump up on top of one of the guard towers.

326
00:16:31,540 --> 00:16:33,540
One of the guard towers.

327
00:16:33,540 --> 00:16:38,500
Yeah, you have to crawl up the guard tower. I'll say okay do this. So so

328
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:45,980
So stadium with a guard tower. Oh, yeah now it is. So you see a guard so you see a guard tower

329
00:16:45,980 --> 00:16:49,220
You're gonna have to do a couple of things

330
00:16:49,220 --> 00:16:55,140
You're gonna need to be able to avoid the guards. I can get to the tower

331
00:16:55,140 --> 00:17:00,300
I can do that and then climb the tower don't know about that one. All right, so

332
00:17:01,380 --> 00:17:05,380
Let's do I'll say that with that crit you're gonna keep avoiding the guards

333
00:17:05,380 --> 00:17:07,540
I'm not gonna stop you from having to do that

334
00:17:07,540 --> 00:17:13,900
You're gonna get to the so you sort of like - pass the guards you go in between one of their legs like like a cartoon

335
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:20,600
You're like skittering around like you see people in line like watching you go by and then you reach

336
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:24,340
You go all the way to the right of this area and you see the one

337
00:17:24,340 --> 00:17:28,980
What's up, this one? I'm moving my characters that here

338
00:17:30,020 --> 00:17:36,140

You're looking at girls gone wild box

341
00:17:45,460 --> 00:17:50,340
Know what that is and it would be funny to buy one of those

342
00:17:50,340 --> 00:17:56,380
A girl's gone wild DVD in 20. They're like they're like 50 bucks. Really?

343
00:17:56,860 --> 00:18:01,260
They were so expensive that's why I never bought him when I was a kid. Yeah, okay

344
00:18:01,260 --> 00:18:06,460
Anyway, the turrets are shooting at you now. I'm gonna say again with that with that crit

345
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:11,060
I don't want to belabor that you're you're able to dodge a turrets the bullets pretty easily

346
00:18:11,060 --> 00:18:15,720
You know shooting at this hamster and now roll an athletics check to climb that tower

347
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:22,620
Can't hide that for me you got a five. Oh, why'd you roll? No, it didn't it wasn't

348
00:18:22,620 --> 00:18:25,620
I don't know what was going on, but it wasn't like...

349
00:18:25,620 --> 00:18:31,120
So you start to crawl up the tower, and you just sort of like fall...

350
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:37,120
You reach a loose brick, and in this tower, this guard tower,

351
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:41,620
and it just slips out of your hand, and as you're falling...

352
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:44,620
Yeah, the hungry hamster died, actually died in the stand concert.

353
00:18:44,620 --> 00:18:45,620
As you're falling...

354
00:18:45,620 --> 00:18:46,620
He fell off the guard tower.

355
00:18:46,620 --> 00:18:51,120
[laughter]

356
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:59,120
As you're falling, your hamster ball deploys to protect you, but you just hit the ground.

357
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:03,120
But people can still see me, right?

358
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:05,120
You're falling from the...

359
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:08,120
Right, but there's guns shooting at me.

360
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:12,120
Yeah, well, hold on. What are you trying to do while you're falling from the tower?

361
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:17,120
There are guns shooting at me, so obviously people are going to look to where the bullets are shooting, correct?

362
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:19,120
Yes, yeah.

363
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:22,480
So, as soon as I hit the ground, I do my famous dance.

364
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:27,840
No, so when you hit the ground, okay, when you hit the ground, you're gonna suffer a

365
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:28,840
concussion.

366
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:29,840
Is that what you're saying?

367
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:30,840
Nah.

368
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:31,840
Nah.

369
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:32,840
I'm at full health, right?

370
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:33,840
Uh, yeah.

371
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:34,840
Okay.

372
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:35,840
I never updated it on my chart.

373
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:42,240
You hit your head, and your tiny little hamster brain rattles around your skull as you bounce

374
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:44,240
around your ball.

375
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:45,600
And you black out, too.

376
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:46,600
You almost had a chance.

377
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:47,600
Nah.

378
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:48,600
You almost had a chance there.

379
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:51,600
Uh, that's not what happened.

380
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:54,600
The first time that Patrick has ever been told no by Patches.

381
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:57,600
I know.

382
00:19:57,600 --> 00:20:01,600
History.

383
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:05,600
I like to reward creativity and creative minds.

384
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:08,600
He sure does have a creative mind.

385
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:21,120
And you all start to come to and you awaken sort of cramped and cold.

386
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:25,200
Hungry hamster, you are all cramped together.

387
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:26,880
You're starting to get a sense of where you are.

388
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:36,240
Hungry hamster, you're just sort of like just waking up and you feel something on your head

389
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:43,620
And as you touch, you realize it's normal dogs, balls are on your head and a normal dog.

390
00:20:43,620 --> 00:20:50,880
You start to come to and you feel a kind of a, it hurts, but it feels like residual pain

391
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:58,040
from Pleasant Parrot's talons, just like scratching into your floppy ears, but you don't really

392
00:20:58,040 --> 00:20:59,740
feel the pain too much anymore.

393
00:20:59,740 --> 00:21:05,080
It's like almost like you're number now and Pleasant Parrot from where you can see on top

394
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:11,640
of this pile and this dark, cold, weird mess is that there's sort of a, you try to squirm

395
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:15,120
around and you brush up against cold steel.

396
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:18,840
And you can start to see in a window, it looks like a window as you're trying to make it,

397
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:24,600
trying to see through and what you realize now is this like goo, it's like bluish, cold

398
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:25,600
goo.

399
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:32,120
You start to make the figure of a man, his back turned to you and he seems to be fiddling

400
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:33,600
with something.

401
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:37,880
juices inside this container making you feel like woozy and drunk you guys are like numb

402
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:45,060
like it's um you try to push your way through are we all in the same place my balls are on

403
00:21:45,060 --> 00:21:53,460
your head and uh what the fuck are you talking about and um what yeah what your balls aren't

404
00:21:53,460 --> 00:21:59,320
on my head he just said my balls are on your head nah he didn't say that my balls are i'm

405
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:02,820
I'm just, I'm fucking rotating your head with my balls like a machine.

406
00:22:02,820 --> 00:22:05,820
You thought he was just saying a place that we were all there?

407
00:22:05,820 --> 00:22:07,820
Yeah, I thought he was just talking shit.

408
00:22:07,820 --> 00:22:12,820
As I often do, folks.

409
00:22:12,820 --> 00:22:18,820
And you can't really feel your head, your heart, your blood is thick with like this.

410
00:22:18,820 --> 00:22:23,820
And this man now turns. And really only Pleasant Parrot could see it because he's by the window.

411
00:22:23,820 --> 00:22:28,820
And, um, Pleasant Parrot, you start to have flashbacks.

412
00:22:28,820 --> 00:22:33,820
to being inside a tank just like this many years ago

413
00:22:33,820 --> 00:22:38,820
and I call him pleasant 11 you remember this man as

414
00:22:38,820 --> 00:22:43,820
Schmidt the Schmuck leave

415
00:22:43,820 --> 00:22:48,820
okay, Schmidt the Schmuck leave

416
00:22:48,820 --> 00:22:53,820
he goes over to the no relation to anybody in particular

417
00:22:53,820 --> 00:23:00,820
that

418
00:23:00,820 --> 00:23:07,500
yes i know that's cd cutlieb is hungarian and american born

419
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:10,420
but what if he was it's been a shmup

420
00:23:10,420 --> 00:23:13,420
and it is

421
00:23:13,420 --> 00:23:17,300
you allegedly i guess not really allegedly he was a scientist in the m_k_

422
00:23:17,300 --> 00:23:19,460
alter experiments

423
00:23:19,460 --> 00:23:20,460
google it

424
00:23:20,460 --> 00:23:23,260
he's a uh... smitty schmaltzy was not

425
00:23:23,260 --> 00:23:28,060

427
00:23:30,420 --> 00:23:32,540
the okay so he's

428
00:23:32,540 --> 00:23:37,460
you'll my most successful experiments in such men's mission will try

429
00:23:37,460 --> 00:23:38,900
program

430
00:23:38,900 --> 00:23:41,980
but i don't understand why you call it that

431
00:23:41,980 --> 00:23:46,380
i think it's a great i don't think that i think that's a real ring to it he puts

432
00:23:46,380 --> 00:23:50,500
finger to the container and he's just like, "Shh, shh."

433
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:54,540
You'll see, and he walks back to his lab station,

434
00:23:54,540 --> 00:23:58,020
"The Iraq war is not going so well.

435
00:23:58,020 --> 00:24:05,020
And so, there's a rise of a Shia organization led by Tony Danza,

436
00:24:05,020 --> 00:24:08,780
who seems to be getting increasing popularity.

437
00:24:08,780 --> 00:24:11,580
So I have been tasked to once again

522
00:28:39,380 --> 00:28:42,380
you when they drop the animals off so

523
00:28:42,380 --> 00:28:44,580
he's been just doing this the whole time

524
00:28:44,580 --> 00:28:48,660
i think i'm going to have a just for god's sake is that

525
00:28:50,660 --> 00:28:52,500
i was just in the bathroom

526
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:54,340
checkups can be hamster

527
00:28:54,340 --> 00:28:58,960
uh... old trick in the book

528
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:01,580
anyway i'll worry about my bike later

529
00:29:01,580 --> 00:29:06,060
i'm sure it's my friends bike i'm sure it's fine

530
00:29:06,060 --> 00:29:08,820
now you guys want to bust out of here what

531
00:29:08,820 --> 00:29:11,400
no i i want to put it somewhere

532
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:14,860
i guess i had to wait to i saw my alligator says what you guys want to

533
00:29:14,860 --> 00:29:15,740
stay here

534
00:29:15,740 --> 00:29:17,740
uh... no you don't

535
00:29:17,740 --> 00:29:20,380
i'm better and i don't have it

536
00:29:20,380 --> 00:29:22,700
uh... yeah i guess we can leave

537
00:29:22,700 --> 00:29:24,020
yeah let's go

538
00:29:24,020 --> 00:29:27,140
uh... yeah you guys uh... leave

539
00:29:27,140 --> 00:29:31,860
this c_i_a_ which may be smartly be just see his like tell his left now member

540
00:29:31,860 --> 00:29:33,340
picking goes

541
00:29:33,340 --> 00:29:37,100
but for a person just like you see his tie comes out

542
00:29:37,100 --> 00:29:38,100
uh...

543
00:29:38,100 --> 00:29:39,020
and uh...

544
00:29:39,020 --> 00:29:41,740
you guys rush up through all these weird catacombs

545
00:29:41,740 --> 00:29:45,580
he passed by other experiments uh... that you didn't know about but if you

546
00:29:45,580 --> 00:29:49,860
just took five seconds to google you'd see that they happen all the time in this

547
00:29:49,860 --> 00:30:01,460
country and you guys and you guys reach the the concert area.

548
00:30:01,460 --> 00:30:05,860
So you're in the crowd of the stained concert is packed with

549
00:30:05,860 --> 00:30:12,160
people you guys are like arrive outside of the the CIA or

550
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:16,560
Shamiya a tunnel that exists underneath Jafar's Palace.

551
00:30:17,060 --> 00:30:19,180
and uh... when you get there

552
00:30:19,180 --> 00:30:22,620
you see the crowd before you and you start to interpret it

553
00:30:22,620 --> 00:30:25,780
maybe based on levels so

554
00:30:25,780 --> 00:30:27,700
uh... how can i

555
00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:29,020
what i've done

556
00:30:29,020 --> 00:30:32,140
is this so you guys are all

557
00:30:32,140 --> 00:30:33,660
to go to each level

558
00:30:33,660 --> 00:30:35,700
you're gonna roll was that

559
00:30:35,700 --> 00:30:38,020
so i kicked the thing okay

560
00:30:38,020 --> 00:30:42,060
uh... my son you're gonna roll a stealth check

561
00:30:42,060 --> 00:30:43,740
uh... each of you all of you

562
00:30:43,740 --> 00:30:48,340
And then you're gonna see and before you do before you do well, I'm gonna take that

563
00:30:48,340 --> 00:30:53,340
All right. So yeah, I mean take that that's fine. But um, so and

564
00:30:53,340 --> 00:31:02,460
But this is why before you do but just keep that one you can declare how many levels you want to go up to get to

565
00:31:02,460 --> 00:31:04,300
The stage where stained is

566
00:31:04,300 --> 00:31:11,180
Okay, so you can stop the concert and find your parents. You're gonna need to go up these multiple levels, right?

567
00:31:11,180 --> 00:31:15,820
So there's four levels in here for the four levels of tickets you could get.

568
00:31:15,820 --> 00:31:17,060
It's sustained.

569
00:31:17,060 --> 00:31:18,060
Don't worry.

570
00:31:18,060 --> 00:31:19,060
Oh, okay.

571
00:31:19,060 --> 00:31:24,220
And if you say you want to go up two levels, there's just going to be a penalty on the

572
00:31:24,220 --> 00:31:25,800
stealthiness of the roll.

573
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:31,860
Because if you go up only one level, if you go up a level and the CIA perceives you, you're

574
00:31:31,860 --> 00:31:33,700
going to get into a fight.

575
00:31:33,700 --> 00:31:37,220
But so if you go up one level at a time, it's easier.

576
00:31:37,220 --> 00:31:39,140
There'll be less of a penalty.

577
00:31:39,140 --> 00:31:44,140
the penalty will be minus 5 on each roll,

578
00:31:44,140 --> 00:31:48,140
depending on the number of levels you go up.

579
00:31:48,140 --> 00:31:51,140
So if you go to 2 levels, it's minus 5.

580
00:31:51,140 --> 00:31:53,140
If you go up 3 levels, it's minus 10.

581
00:31:53,140 --> 00:31:55,140
So that's really the only options there.

582
00:31:55,140 --> 00:31:59,140
And if you get into a fight, you can flee the fight,

583
00:31:59,140 --> 00:32:02,140
which will bring you back down a level if you feel like it's too tough,

584
00:32:02,140 --> 00:32:04,140
because the fights will be sort of randomly generated,

585
00:32:04,140 --> 00:32:06,140
their level of difficulty.

586
00:32:08,140 --> 00:32:11,140
uh... but you can also fight through it and then you'll make it to the next

587
00:32:11,140 --> 00:32:14,020
level or to whatever level you're trying to get

588
00:32:14,020 --> 00:32:16,820
so it's like blackjack

589
00:32:16,820 --> 00:32:20,140
yeah it's like this is the name of the guy who i was a service animal in the

590
00:32:20,140 --> 00:32:24,780
line

591
00:32:24,780 --> 00:32:25,980
yeah

592
00:32:25,980 --> 00:32:26,980
and what were you gonna say?

593
00:32:26,980 --> 00:32:28,260
what's it like

594
00:32:28,260 --> 00:32:29,220
cameron

595
00:32:29,220 --> 00:32:32,940
do we start on level one? you start on level one okay

596
00:32:32,940 --> 00:32:36,700
and around you this is where the losers are these freaks can never get close

597
00:32:36,700 --> 00:32:43,700
is

598
00:32:43,700 --> 00:32:50,700
and

599
00:32:50,700 --> 00:32:55,620
be good hygiene. Yeah, they could be scratching off dirt. Amazing hygiene. Yeah, for animals

600
00:32:55,620 --> 00:32:59,660
that's amazing hygiene. Yeah, scratching shit off your ass. You guys all interpret it as

601
00:32:59,660 --> 00:33:06,420
fine right now. Yeah. So this is where the cool guys stay. I just want to stay here all

602
00:33:06,420 --> 00:33:12,460
night. It's just like the back of the bus. You guys are like my new family. Yeah, you

603
00:33:12,460 --> 00:33:16,060
see a person go bark look right at you.

604
00:33:16,060 --> 00:33:17,060
A human?

605
00:33:17,060 --> 00:33:18,060
Yeah.

606
00:33:18,060 --> 00:33:19,060
Yeah.

607
00:33:19,060 --> 00:33:22,460
Um, but yeah, so the CIA are hot in your tail.

608
00:33:22,460 --> 00:33:23,460
So what do you guys want to do?

609
00:33:23,460 --> 00:33:25,300
How many levels you want to try to go?

610
00:33:25,300 --> 00:33:28,700
I go up to level three because I'm at level one and you said if I get.

611
00:33:28,700 --> 00:33:31,180
Oh no, you got to reroll now that you know the rules.

612
00:33:31,180 --> 00:33:36,060
There's no there's no fucking way that you know, you got to reroll.

613
00:33:36,060 --> 00:33:39,420
I rolled the 21 so I get to go up to level three.

614
00:33:39,420 --> 00:33:42,220
No, because you don't get to gamble money that you that you.

615
00:33:42,220 --> 00:33:45,420
So you guys could try to...

616
00:33:45,420 --> 00:33:46,420
What do you mean?

617
00:33:46,420 --> 00:33:47,420
I mean, I...

618
00:33:47,420 --> 00:33:48,820
It's like getting a fucking...

619
00:33:48,820 --> 00:33:54,540
It's like hitting 21 in blackjack and then being like, "I bet $1,000."

620
00:33:54,540 --> 00:33:58,020
That's just exactly like how every billionaire at Vegas works.

621
00:33:58,020 --> 00:33:59,020
No, but here's the thing though.

622
00:33:59,020 --> 00:34:02,020
So all your self-rolls will be done.

623
00:34:02,020 --> 00:34:03,020
What?

624
00:34:03,020 --> 00:34:04,020
What?

625
00:34:04,020 --> 00:34:05,020
No, pause.

626
00:34:05,020 --> 00:34:08,620
Okay, there's a couple things that we just unlocked in Patrick.

627
00:34:08,620 --> 00:34:15,620
the

628
00:34:15,620 --> 00:34:29,500
the

629
00:34:29,500 --> 00:34:44,500
the

630
00:34:44,500 --> 00:34:59,500
a

631
00:34:59,500 --> 00:35:03,940
accumulated his billions. First off, he bought the Venetian.

632
00:35:03,940 --> 00:35:05,560
Yes. Okay.

633
00:35:05,560 --> 00:35:09,700
He grew up in Dorchester too. And then every day, he walked in.

634
00:35:09,700 --> 00:35:11,700
No, he has the Boston mindset. And he would bet after he gets this to hand.

635
00:35:11,700 --> 00:35:14,700
He grew up in Dorchester, he has the Boston mindset, which is how this makes sense.

636
00:35:14,700 --> 00:35:16,700
Okay, it's the Boston, I'm sorry, it's the Boston mindset.

637
00:35:16,700 --> 00:35:17,700
Exactly. The Boston mindset.

638
00:35:17,700 --> 00:35:18,700
Who is incorrect. Exactly.

639
00:35:18,700 --> 00:35:22,100
That is the Boston mindset, right. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. We're

640
00:35:22,100 --> 00:35:27,940
not going to not go by the Boston mindset in this D&D campaign. I'm sorry. I'm sorry, but

641
00:35:27,940 --> 00:35:34,940
and

642
00:35:34,940 --> 00:35:41,940
not

643
00:35:41,940 --> 00:35:45,980
so my other top unit they talk a lot of the street they talk is to a citizen

644
00:35:45,980 --> 00:35:47,540
they taught you that i did

645
00:35:47,540 --> 00:35:50,260
but it's held in a dozen makes his bets after he

646
00:35:50,260 --> 00:35:51,720
he had a blackjack

647
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:55,380
yes they taught me that sheldon adelson is evil but i don't want to get into why

648
00:35:55,380 --> 00:35:56,100
this is that

649
00:35:56,100 --> 00:35:57,900
this is the

650
00:35:57,900 --> 00:36:00,740
the same daddy gave you fries

651
00:36:00,740 --> 00:36:02,060
you know you that right

652
00:36:02,060 --> 00:36:04,340
yes stirred

653
00:36:04,340 --> 00:36:08,140
yes so i mean the thing is you don't roll stealth check

654
00:36:08,140 --> 00:36:10,460
added up and i'm gonna roll a

655
00:36:10,460 --> 00:36:13,660
a perception check against that

656
00:36:13,660 --> 00:36:18,380
uh... with despise so we are all together still got a twenty one so i don't know

657
00:36:18,380 --> 00:36:20,500
what i think there that you're getting

658
00:36:20,500 --> 00:36:24,180
well so no so wouldn't be a go up to level three you choose how many levels

659
00:36:24,180 --> 00:36:27,500
you want to go up and then you suffer a penalty on your own okay but i got a

660
00:36:27,500 --> 00:36:31,100
twenty one so i don't suffer any penalties it's not no so

661
00:36:31,100 --> 00:36:34,140
either way you're gonna get to the front of the

662
00:36:34,140 --> 00:36:35,540
this is part of the

663
00:36:35,540 --> 00:36:38,020
i mean which you have but you know

664
00:36:38,020 --> 00:36:39,720
(laughing)

665
00:36:39,720 --> 00:36:42,000
- You guys wanna try for level three or level two?

666
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,400
- Oh wait, we do it as a group?

667
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:44,240
- Yeah.

668
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:45,080
- Oh, okay.

669
00:36:45,080 --> 00:36:45,900
- Yeah, I'm sorry.

670
00:36:45,900 --> 00:36:46,740
- That makes more sense.

671
00:36:46,740 --> 00:36:47,580
- Yeah, okay.

672
00:36:47,580 --> 00:36:49,000
- All right, then I would never have gone

673
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:49,840
into the Sheldon Ableson group.

674
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:50,720
- I'll try for level three.

675
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:52,480
I got really good stealth.

676
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:53,320
- Okay.

677
00:36:53,320 --> 00:36:54,160
- Me, not.

678
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:55,240
- 18.

679
00:36:55,240 --> 00:36:56,700
- Okay.

680
00:36:56,700 --> 00:36:57,680
- Caleb?

681
00:36:57,680 --> 00:36:58,520
- 12.

682
00:36:58,520 --> 00:36:59,640
(burps)

683
00:36:59,640 --> 00:37:01,280
- Bringing the team down here.

684
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:04,120
- I think that averages out to a--

685
00:37:04,120 --> 00:37:06,040
- So you guys all trying to go to level three?

686
00:37:06,040 --> 00:37:06,880
- Yeah.

687
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:07,840
- Okay.

688
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:10,880
you guys do you get up to level three

689
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:11,760
but

690
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:15,180
nara for levels just i don't know if we mention that all you guys get up to

691
00:37:15,180 --> 00:37:17,960
level three but not without

692
00:37:17,960 --> 00:37:19,000
a fight

693
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:21,080
uh...

694
00:37:21,080 --> 00:37:23,400
because uh... you guys were in stealthy enough so you guys

695

702
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:43,120

third-level people are the worst people in the world they're not staying fans

719
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:34,280
that's where this hipster this coffee drinking avocado fucking hipster is

a bunch of rich posers that they get school to be in to stain

721
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:41,040
where they get ironic to be in to stain they've lost the plot

722
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:42,760
they own three buildings each

723
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:46,720
in downtown duluth insist on hanging out with the tenants and always ask you if

724
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:49,400

725
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:52,960

726
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:55,780
while doing coke off of max out credit cards

00:38:55,780 --> 00:39:00,620
there are no black people in this area of the of the this is not it's all

728
00:39:00,620 --> 00:39:04,340
all asian-american iranians of my interesting that you would choose to

729
00:39:04,340 --> 00:39:07,140
eliminate them from this area patches but

730
00:39:07,140 --> 00:39:11,820
i guess you're the d_n_a_ it's all iranians here

731
00:39:11,820 --> 00:39:17,100
so maybe that's maybe that's my way out of the i'd have no

732
00:39:17,100 --> 00:39:18,860

733
00:39:18,860 --> 00:39:19,980

00:39:23,160 --> 00:39:24,760
I don't remember it very well.

736
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:25,760
Okay.

737
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:26,760
So I don't know what you did there.

738
00:39:26,760 --> 00:39:29,480
It's any Ron.

739
00:39:29,480 --> 00:39:31,320
Roll for initiative, you know.

740
00:39:31,320 --> 00:39:32,320
Okay.

741
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:34,760
Will this help me to Argo?

742
00:39:34,760 --> 00:39:35,760
In a way.

743
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:36,760
I got 11.

744
00:39:36,760 --> 00:39:37,760
No, don't we all.

745
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:38,760
I got a 23, bro.

746
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:39,760
What do I roll?

747
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:40,760
I roll a 20.

748
00:39:40,760 --> 00:39:42,680
Oh, you got a crit.

749
00:39:42,680 --> 00:39:45,120
So unless somebody else gets a crit, you go first.

750
00:39:45,120 --> 00:39:46,960
So I roll a d20 or initiative?

751
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:47,960
Initiative.

752
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:50,200
My life a movie.

753
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:51,320
Yeah.

754
00:39:51,320 --> 00:39:52,320
That's right.

755
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:53,320
Caleb.

756
00:39:53,320 --> 00:39:54,960
Uh, okay, cool.

757
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:55,960
First, normal dog.

758
00:39:55,960 --> 00:39:57,880
Yeah, you got the jump on everybody.

759
00:39:57,880 --> 00:40:02,160
So you navigated through the crowd, you hung out with some of the chill people there, and

760
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:06,040
then sort of spotted the CIA right away when they spotted you.

761
00:40:06,040 --> 00:40:07,160
So you got the jump.

762
00:40:07,160 --> 00:40:08,160
Hmm.

763
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:15,920
And, uh, also I'll say, normal dog, roll a constitution saving throw.

764
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:17,960
I got a 19.

765
00:40:17,960 --> 00:40:19,040
Whoa!

766
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:24,200
You feel your body start to react from the experiments that were happening earlier.

767
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:31,920
But you're able to resist whatever it is that's happening to you.

768
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:32,920
And now you get to go.

769
00:40:32,920 --> 00:40:39,360
Okay, can I use my vicious ability?

770
00:40:39,360 --> 00:40:41,060
It will work no matter what.

771
00:40:41,060 --> 00:40:45,400
If you roll a 19 on a crit, you just get a crit.

772
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:46,400
And then you get also a triple.

773
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:47,400
Oh, okay.

774
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:48,400
And I roll the attack three times?

775
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:51,000
Yeah, it's just a combination of a couple of critical abilities.

776
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:52,000
I just don't know what else to say.

777
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:53,000
Oh, okay.

778
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:54,500
Alright, then I'm gonna go for the old...

779
00:40:54,500 --> 00:40:59,200
I'm gonna go for the old bite on the nearest one, this guy.

780
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:00,200
Do it.

781
00:41:00,200 --> 00:41:01,200
Fuck his ass up.

782
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:02,200
Fuck his ass.

783
00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:03,200
Fuck his ass.

784
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:04,200
14.

785
00:41:04,200 --> 00:41:05,200
No, don't, guys.

786
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:06,200
Come on.

787
00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:07,200
Fuck his ass.

788
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:08,200
Fuck his ass.

789
00:41:08,200 --> 00:41:09,200
Fuck his ass.

790
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:10,200
Fuck the guy.

791
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:11,200
Fuck his ass as a dog.

792
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:14,120
Yeah, no, that's fucking ridiculous.

793
00:41:14,120 --> 00:41:16,160
And that doesn't hit anyway, so...

794
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:17,160
Well...

795
00:41:17,160 --> 00:41:18,160
Well, it hits...

796
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:23,320
it would have been a fifteen damage. It would have been very good. Your loss buddy. It's

797
00:41:23,320 --> 00:41:28,120
not literally. Let's get the twenty one. Let's do the twenty one. It's literally your loss.

798
00:41:28,120 --> 00:41:33,040
Instead of the fourteen. Not my loss. No I think it's our win. Well it's actually the

799
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:40,040
CIA's turn. Hey buddy is it? They don't wait for anyone's turn let me tell you. The C guys

800
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:50,960
say. That one tries to attack you, the one you just tried to bite at, and he just also

801
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:57,240
whiffs, so it's a very anime fight. They're just missing each other, being cool, missing

802
00:41:57,240 --> 00:42:04,320
each other. How do you miss on a dog, dude? Because you're fast, you're a fast dog. I

803
00:42:04,320 --> 00:42:10,700
just wanted you to say that. Just admit I'm fast. And now the other ones that are there

804
00:42:10,700 --> 00:42:12,940

935
00:49:17,300 --> 00:49:19,000
that's fine

936
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:22,160
the constitution saving their helps eleven rick

937
00:49:22,160 --> 00:49:27,840
k_s_ so you start to feel your body change and get to you feel like your

938
00:49:27,840 --> 00:49:31,680
head turning slowly back into uh... diane lane in

939
00:49:31,680 --> 00:49:34,660
and you feel your cells are to realign

940
00:49:34,660 --> 00:49:36,080
and uh...

941
00:49:36,080 --> 00:49:38,940
you feel your tongue in your head

942
00:49:38,940 --> 00:49:41,500
that was already five feet long.

943
00:49:41,500 --> 00:49:43,260
- Big tongue.

944
00:49:43,260 --> 00:49:47,700
- You feel it grow and roll up and grow and grow and grow.

945
00:49:47,700 --> 00:49:52,240
It feels like your tongue could maybe go on forever.

946
00:49:52,240 --> 00:49:55,180
- I try that.

947
00:49:55,180 --> 00:49:56,420
- Okay.

948
00:49:56,420 --> 00:49:59,480
You feel inside that you have two things

949
00:49:59,480 --> 00:50:00,880
you can do with your tongue.

950
00:50:00,880 --> 00:50:05,460
Something called the tongue of tranquility

951
00:50:05,460 --> 00:50:08,180
and something called the tongue of madness.

952
00:50:08,180 --> 00:50:20,700
time

953
00:50:20,700 --> 00:50:25,020
I couldn't have written it better myself.

954
00:50:25,020 --> 00:50:28,540
Let's see how they do.

955
00:50:28,540 --> 00:50:34,940
Yeah, so their tongue, the tongue, your tongue, not their tongue, goes up all these guys buttholes.

956
00:50:34,940 --> 00:50:35,940
Yes.

957
00:50:35,940 --> 00:50:41,060
And you watch them just like, like make like anime noises.

958
00:50:41,060 --> 00:50:43,300
The ultimate pleasure sounds.

959
00:50:43,300 --> 00:50:49,800
And they suffer from two levels of exhaustion, which...

960
00:50:49,800 --> 00:50:54,960
In Dungeons and Dragons parlance, I'll show you guys what exhaustion is.

961
00:50:54,960 --> 00:50:59,500
Their speed is halved?

962
00:50:59,500 --> 00:51:01,320
And they have disadvantage on ability checks.

963
00:51:01,320 --> 00:51:02,320
They take both.

964
00:51:02,320 --> 00:51:03,320
Okay.

965
00:51:03,320 --> 00:51:05,360
Wait, what does a six death do?

966
00:51:05,360 --> 00:51:08,560
If you get them to six levels of exhaustion, they die.

967
00:51:08,560 --> 00:51:13,560
So you're telling me I gotta keep licking these guys' fuckin' assholes 'til they get to-- 'til they die?

968
00:51:13,560 --> 00:51:17,560
If you want to, but right now they also have disadvantage on the ability checks they want to do.

969
00:51:17,560 --> 00:51:19,560
Okay. Now I know how to win.

970
00:51:19,560 --> 00:51:27,560
And their speed is halved. Yeah. And we'll get into how many uses of that you have after this fight, but for now, consider yourself Golden Ponyboy.

971
00:51:27,560 --> 00:51:31,560
And I'll-- yeah, you'll see. You'll see. It'll expand. That's your turn now.

972
00:51:31,560 --> 00:51:33,560
Okay.

973
00:51:33,560 --> 00:51:35,680
uh... it is now

974
00:51:35,680 --> 00:51:38,440
uh... look at the it's now the c_i_a_ agents turns

975
00:51:38,440 --> 00:51:43,360
and their there's there is a look sluggish they look tired they just got

976
00:51:43,360 --> 00:51:47,640
their spot holes like that affect the c_i_a_ agent agent i'm inside of

977
00:51:47,640 --> 00:51:52,040
retired he's dead i mean too much we had he's dead but that doesn't affect like

978
00:51:52,040 --> 00:51:56,260

979
00:51:56,260 --> 00:52:01,080

00:52:02,400 --> 00:52:03,400
somebody else said some shit.

982
00:52:03,400 --> 00:52:06,500
Are they are they exhausted from just like coming too hard?

983
00:52:06,500 --> 00:52:07,700
Like their legs are twitching?

984
00:52:07,700 --> 00:52:08,500
Yes.

985
00:52:08,500 --> 00:52:09,200
Okay, cool.

986
00:52:09,200 --> 00:52:10,200
That's what happened.

987
00:52:10,200 --> 00:52:10,400
Nice.

988
00:52:10,400 --> 00:52:11,900
Their mascara is bleeding down.

989
00:52:11,900 --> 00:52:14,400
Yeah, all of mascara on cool.

990
00:52:14,400 --> 00:52:14,700
Yeah.

00:52:14,700 --> 00:52:15,200
Yeah.

992
00:52:15,200 --> 00:52:16,400
Yeah, they make the head.

993
00:52:16,400 --> 00:52:17,900
Hey gal face.

994
00:52:17,900 --> 00:52:20,800
Yeah, there that's why they're all cross-eyed.

995
00:52:20,800 --> 00:52:28,000
And they're going to try to move in on this one's going to try to move in on

996
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:30,000
man bear pig, but they move so sluggish.

997
00:52:30,600 --> 00:52:35,120
They have like half movement, but this one's gonna try to go after you pleasant parrot

998
00:52:35,120 --> 00:52:40,700
And pleasant Perry you roll a constitution saving throw while this guy's coming after you, okay?

00:52:40,700 --> 00:52:44,120
Nat one, okay. No

1000
00:52:44,120 --> 00:52:52,360
No, that's so first of all, okay, that's all right, that's actually good in this case as you've seen

1001
00:52:52,360 --> 00:52:57,440
so your eyes roll all the way to the back your head and

1002
00:52:57,960 --> 00:53:01,480
and then back around and back to the back your head again

1003
00:53:01,480 --> 00:53:04,440
and that does that three more times

1004
00:53:04,440 --> 00:53:06,000
you hear

1005
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:07,480

1006
00:53:07,480 --> 00:53:08,560

1007
00:53:08,560 --> 00:53:10,240

1014
00:53:37,360 --> 00:53:49,040
Hungry Hamster is in, comes back to life, but it seems to be under your control.

1015
00:53:49,040 --> 00:53:56,520
And you sense that there are maybe other bodies that are coming back to life.

1016
00:53:56,520 --> 00:54:23,520

00:54:37,340 --> 00:54:42,920
Whenever you did whatever it is you just did and

1022
00:54:42,920 --> 00:54:45,520

i think patches was gone when i talked about having a dog phone

1155
01:03:49,440 --> 01:03:53,400
maybe patches missed that but we have to talk about it before we rush over

1156
01:03:53,400 --> 01:03:56,280

1163
01:04:10,260 --> 01:04:13,440
you don't have to roll persuasion on the phone man you call the number

He starts fingerpicking the unmistakable opening riff to "It's Been Awhile"

1203
01:07:09,020 --> 01:07:14,020
and you see like Rob Bogoyevich in the crowd, his eyes are welling up with tears.

1204
01:07:14,020 --> 01:07:22,020
And then you see Candy Hamster come out from backstage

1205
01:07:22,020 --> 01:07:26,020
and you see him start to transform.

1206
01:07:26,020 --> 01:07:35,300
Um, you guys rush the stage, couldn't find a picture of Stain so it's disturbed, he looks

1207
01:07:35,300 --> 01:07:38,900
pretty much the same though.

1208
01:07:38,900 --> 01:07:45,300
And uh, you see Candy Hanzo and he said "I WANTED YOU THREE GONE!

1209
01:07:45,300 --> 01:07:48,940
YOU BASTARDS!" and he starts to transform.

1210
01:07:48,940 --> 01:07:52,240
the c_i_a_s injected me with so much shit

1211
01:07:52,240 --> 01:07:54,480
i'm crazy with it

1212
01:07:54,480 --> 01:07:55,600
and uh...

1213
01:07:55,600 --> 01:08:00,600
starts spinning around and around and around and around and around and around

1214
01:08:00,600 --> 01:08:03,680
and around and around until the sugar

1215
01:08:03,680 --> 01:08:05,180
he turns into

1216
01:08:05,180 --> 01:08:08,680
his final form

1217
01:08:08,680 --> 01:08:09,820
which is a

1218
01:08:09,820 --> 01:08:10,820
cotton

1219
01:08:10,820 --> 01:08:12,940
candy

1220
01:08:12,940 --> 01:08:14,980
that's dog

1221
01:08:14,980 --> 01:08:21,980
I couldn't find, I could not find, I could not find, I could not find, I'm not accepting this.

1222
01:08:21,980 --> 01:08:24,500
Just let him turn into a cotton candy dog.

1223
01:08:24,500 --> 01:08:25,620
Get a new one.

1224
01:08:25,620 --> 01:08:27,860
Cotton candy Pomeranian, is that what you mean?

1225
01:08:27,860 --> 01:08:28,860
Yeah, that's right.

1226
01:08:28,860 --> 01:08:29,860
Yeah.

1227
01:08:29,860 --> 01:08:33,100
And he's like, "No, I will kill you all."

1228
01:08:33,100 --> 01:08:35,780
Why would he be scared of a seed?

1229
01:08:35,780 --> 01:08:38,620
Wait, he's made entirely out of food?

1230
01:08:38,620 --> 01:08:42,740
He's, yes, he's made entirely out of cotton candy now.

1231
01:08:42,740 --> 01:08:43,740
Yeah.

1232
01:08:43,740 --> 01:08:44,740
You fucking moron.

1233
01:08:44,740 --> 01:08:46,740
but it's a lot of people

1234
01:08:46,740 --> 01:08:49,040
it's a and now

1235
01:08:49,040 --> 01:08:50,980
the guy who was hungry is not the whole

1236
01:08:50,980 --> 01:08:53,260
his cancer of all time

1237
01:08:53,260 --> 01:08:57,460
you will be hungry when i don't because you'll be dead he'll still be a

1238
01:08:57,460 --> 01:09:00,100
everybody i don't know what i was thinking about it

1239
01:09:00,100 --> 01:09:04,620
but in answer to that drawing on my face in world twenty

1240
01:09:04,620 --> 01:09:05,900
please stop it

1241
01:09:05,900 --> 01:09:09,380
and uh...

1242
01:09:09,380 --> 01:09:10,900
this is the big one

1243
01:09:10,900 --> 01:09:14,780
all right imagine intense jrpg boss battle music play

1244
01:09:14,780 --> 01:09:18,380
hey the candy hamster has a penis and a vagina

1245
01:09:18,380 --> 01:09:19,580
and that's okay

1246
01:09:19,580 --> 01:09:21,780
and that's what we drew

1247
01:09:21,780 --> 01:09:22,780
i got ten

1248
01:09:22,780 --> 01:09:25,060
on initiative

1249
01:09:25,060 --> 01:09:26,120
i got

1250
01:09:26,120 --> 01:09:29,300
twenty two dude

1251
01:09:29,300 --> 01:09:30,860
he's really strong

1252
01:09:30,860 --> 01:09:32,000
i'm like not

1253
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:35,060
not fucking around with the candy hamster

1254
01:09:35,060 --> 01:09:37,540
you guys it's not gonna be an easy fight

1255
01:09:37,540 --> 01:09:38,460
okay

1256
01:09:38,460 --> 01:09:40,100
uh...

1257
01:09:40,100 --> 01:09:43,500
it's going to be uncle shredders turn first

1258
01:09:43,500 --> 01:09:45,380
he's gonna run up

1259
01:09:45,380 --> 01:09:47,100
as close as he can

1260
01:09:47,100 --> 01:09:49,220
and throw his fubu shuriken

1261
01:09:49,220 --> 01:09:53,380
uh...

1262
01:09:53,380 --> 01:09:55,460
it's too bad for him

1263
01:09:55,460 --> 01:09:56,980
yeah he got twelve

1264
01:09:56,980 --> 01:09:59,060
uh... and it just like

1265
01:09:59,060 --> 01:10:00,900
goes right through

1266
01:10:00,900 --> 01:10:02,300
candy hamster

1267
01:10:02,300 --> 01:10:07,300
uh... cotton candy layer or should i say cotton candy dogs

1268
01:10:07,300 --> 01:10:08,660
cotton candy layer

1269
01:10:08,660 --> 01:10:14,180
We'll put a picture of that up so this is making a little more sense for people to see.

1270
01:10:14,180 --> 01:10:20,020
And it is now, that's kind of all he can do really, so it's now your turn, strange dog.

1271
01:10:20,020 --> 01:10:21,860
You feeling a little weird?

1272
01:10:21,860 --> 01:10:24,100
Yeah, I'm a little weird.

1273
01:10:24,100 --> 01:10:31,660
So I'm going to exhaust this fool with my tongue of madness.

1274
01:10:31,660 --> 01:10:36,100
Okay, use one of your four uses.

1275
01:10:36,100 --> 01:10:43,160
he's gonna he's going to roll a wisdom saving throw against it hmm okay he

1276
01:10:43,160 --> 01:10:49,740
doesn't oh let's go dude we have and disadvantage on ability checks oh yes

1277
01:10:49,740 --> 01:10:56,060
we're gonna win so yeah the tongue goes into his butt wherever that is you want

1278
01:10:56,060 --> 01:11:02,940
to cut on a cotton candy and he's like where the stick goes in the not my stick

1279
01:11:02,940 --> 01:11:06,940
No! It's just like, you see him just get visibly tired.

1280
01:11:06,940 --> 01:11:11,940
He has two points of exhaustion on him. He turns to a different color.

1281
01:11:11,940 --> 01:11:15,940
So now, it is his turn though.

1282
01:11:15,940 --> 01:11:18,940
And so he's got a couple things he's gonna do.

1283
01:11:18,940 --> 01:11:23,940
First thing he's gonna do, you're gonna watch him, he spins around faster and faster and faster,

1284
01:11:23,940 --> 01:11:25,940
until he becomes a blur.

1285
01:11:25,940 --> 01:11:43,860
are

1286
01:11:43,860 --> 01:12:02,500
see

1287
01:12:02,500 --> 01:12:09,500
so

1288
01:12:09,500 --> 01:12:14,500
to them in any way, you might be subject to some sort of a Twizzler-based attack.

1289
01:12:14,500 --> 01:12:20,740
That's one of the scariest attacks, I think, to me.

1290
01:12:20,740 --> 01:12:29,540
And now he's also RIP Mac Miller.

1291
01:12:29,540 --> 01:12:35,300
This whole time Patrick has been working really hard to write letters.

1292
01:12:35,300 --> 01:12:39,700
And yeah you see the candy hamster is going to start to move.

1293
01:12:39,700 --> 01:12:43,100
We're at half speed though so only over here.

1294
01:12:43,100 --> 01:12:50,860
And now it is your turn world eater hamster.

1295
01:12:50,860 --> 01:12:53,220
Well I'm the world eater hamster.

1296
01:12:53,220 --> 01:12:55,620
This guy's made out of cotton candy.

1297
01:12:55,620 --> 01:12:57,660
I think you know what's going to happen.

1298
01:12:57,660 --> 01:13:02,340
You're going to try to eat him?

1299
01:13:02,340 --> 01:13:04,340
Like you said it, not me.

1300
01:13:04,340 --> 01:13:08,340
Let me pull up the ruler real quick.

1301
01:13:08,340 --> 01:13:10,340
Do I have...

1302
01:13:10,340 --> 01:13:12,340
They're like 50 feet from the stage.

1303
01:13:12,340 --> 01:13:16,340
Does my thing go up because I'm the world leader hamster?

1304
01:13:16,340 --> 01:13:18,340
No, your movement's the same.

1305
01:13:18,340 --> 01:13:20,340
Okay.

1306
01:13:20,340 --> 01:13:23,340
Do I have like an inhale move?

1307
01:13:23,340 --> 01:13:30,340
You don't, but I feel really stupid for not adding that in.

1308
01:13:30,340 --> 01:13:37,340
in

1309
01:13:37,340 --> 01:13:55,860
of

1310
01:13:55,860 --> 01:14:02,860
of

1311
01:14:02,860 --> 01:14:13,500
double move over here and do it next turn okay wait so is there anything i could do right now that could

1312
01:14:13,500 --> 01:14:19,100
oh i can hit him you could do uh hamster ball uses your movement so you can do hamster ball

1313
01:14:19,100 --> 01:14:24,620
you can also do get item and try to eat the item and see what you get out of that too okay i'll do

1314
01:14:24,620 --> 01:14:31,580
i'll do what i mean so hamster ball would count as a movement yeah yeah hamster but it would make me

1315
01:14:31,580 --> 01:14:36,500
closer to the candy hamster. Yes, it would be a movement and an attack. Hamster ball allows

1316
01:14:36,500 --> 01:14:42,700
you to use your full movement as an attack too. Okay. But there's no saying that I can't

1317
01:14:42,700 --> 01:14:49,220
inhale him in my hamster ball. There's no rule in the rule books. No, but I'm going to say

1318
01:14:49,220 --> 01:14:52,500
because you're using the hamster ball as your action, that's going to stop you from doing

1319
01:14:52,500 --> 01:15:00,980
inhale which would be an action. Okay. Guys, what do you think I should do? Just take your

1320
01:15:00,980 --> 01:15:07,340
turn. Yeah, I know, but I need help with my turn. Be your own man. Just make a decision.

1321
01:15:07,340 --> 01:15:12,060
I'm trying, I'm trying. Just look at the stuff you have that you can possibly do and then

1322
01:15:12,060 --> 01:15:19,740
do one of the things. Maybe just pass to the next one. Could I do the famous dance on them?

1323
01:15:19,740 --> 01:15:24,800
You could certainly try. Okay, I'm feeling this is going to be a hard one to pull off.

1324
01:15:24,800 --> 01:15:25,800
I'm doing the famous dance.

1325
01:15:25,800 --> 01:15:28,320
They're the hardest boss in the entire game.

1326
01:15:28,320 --> 01:15:31,080
Yeah, they got a grip.

1327
01:15:31,080 --> 01:15:34,560
They are just like, "DANCING IS STUPID!"

1328
01:15:34,560 --> 01:15:36,480
I hate candy now.

1329
01:15:36,480 --> 01:15:38,640
I'm only gonna eat beef.

1330
01:15:38,640 --> 01:15:39,640
NO!

1331
01:15:39,640 --> 01:15:42,280
You're the keto hamster, dude.

1332
01:15:42,280 --> 01:15:46,800
I'm the keto hamster.

1333
01:15:46,800 --> 01:15:50,000
You're the Michaela Peterson carnivore diet hamster.

1334
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:51,000
Yeah, exactly.

1335
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:53,000
Oh, okay, yeah, he went.

1336
01:15:53,000 --> 01:15:54,280
Oh, okay, yeah, he went--

1337
01:15:54,280 --> 01:15:56,280
Okay, yeah, it's your turn, Very Pleasant Parrot.

1338
01:15:56,280 --> 01:15:57,180
Okay.

1339
01:15:57,180 --> 01:15:58,480
Um...

1340
01:15:58,480 --> 01:16:02,480
I'm gonna move a little bit, just so I have, like, line of sight.

1341
01:16:02,480 --> 01:16:04,560
To, uh...

1342
01:16:04,560 --> 01:16:08,480
To the Cotton Candy Monster.

1343
01:16:08,480 --> 01:16:10,000
Um...

1344
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:11,000
Oh shit, sorry.

1345
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:12,520
I think you know that's not his name.

1346
01:16:12,520 --> 01:16:15,160
Okay, sorry, before you do that,

1347
01:16:15,160 --> 01:16:19,880
and I'm sorry about this especially to, uh, uh, the World Eater Hamster,

1348
01:16:20,440 --> 01:16:21,440
uh...

1349
01:16:21,440 --> 01:16:23,760
role a dexterity saving throw

1350
01:16:23,760 --> 01:16:25,600
world leader hamster

1351
01:16:25,600 --> 01:16:27,600
at eleven

1352
01:16:27,600 --> 01:16:31,560
you roll up on this guy you start to do your little famous boogie dance and you see he

1353
01:16:31,560 --> 01:16:32,800
resists it

1354
01:16:32,800 --> 01:16:35,640
and then one of the twizzler stalks

1355
01:16:35,640 --> 01:16:37,920
just fucking scoops you the fuck up

1356
01:16:37,920 --> 01:16:41,560

1357
01:16:41,560 --> 01:16:42,200

1358
01:16:42,200 --> 01:16:44,080

and uh... yeah you're just

1360
01:16:45,880 --> 01:16:47,360
trapped in there right now

1361
01:16:47,360 --> 01:16:48,720
uh...

1362
01:16:48,720 --> 01:16:51,120
uh... you might be able to get an extra

1363
01:16:51,120 --> 01:16:51,940
now

1364
01:16:51,940 --> 01:16:53,060
very pleasant

1365
01:16:53,060 --> 01:16:56,980
okay so i'm just gonna get line of sight on them

1366
01:16:56,980 --> 01:16:58,880
cotton candy creature

1367
01:16:58,880 --> 01:17:02,780
and i'm just gonna go ahead and use the left for a year

1368
01:17:02,780 --> 01:17:04,580
the original

1369
01:17:04,580 --> 01:17:08,720
uh... well i don't know all you all use the new one the uh... do it

1370

yet your eyes roll the back your head eight thousand times like uh...

1372
01:17:16,040 --> 01:17:17,600
fucking slots

1373
01:17:17,600 --> 01:17:20,240

1410
01:19:35,140 --> 01:19:36,860

He's gonna try to, uh, charge for the, uh, candy hamster.

1414
01:19:44,860 --> 01:19:46,860
And take out his Fubu Shuriken again.

1415
01:19:46,860 --> 01:19:48,200
Um...

1416
01:19:48,200 --> 01:19:52,420
He just throws his Fubu Shuriken and the candy hamster is able to...

1417
01:19:52,420 --> 01:19:55,220
With also his increased, uh, ability to...

1418
01:19:55,220 --> 01:19:58,740
To be, uh, ghost-like, he's able to definitely get out of the way of it.

1419
01:19:58,740 --> 01:20:02,220
But now it is your turn, strange dog, once again.

1420

1427
01:20:23,980 --> 01:20:29,980
I'm doing it right now

1428
01:20:29,980 --> 01:20:33,940
yeah he's able to resist it this time

1429
01:20:33,940 --> 01:20:35,140

1430
01:20:35,140 --> 01:20:36,740

1436
01:20:54,280 --> 01:20:55,360
uh...

1437
01:20:55,360 --> 01:20:59,620
he starts to spin again this time faster than he even was already that made him a

1438
01:20:59,620 --> 01:21:01,200
blur

1439
01:21:01,200 --> 01:21:04,620
and everybody roll a dexterity saving throw

1440
01:21:04,620 --> 01:21:06,620
Including the agent Smith's and the team

1441
01:21:06,620 --> 01:21:08,780
18

1442
01:21:08,780 --> 01:21:11,140
11 12 so uh

1443
01:21:11,140 --> 01:21:14,860
Man-bear pig uncle shredder

1444
01:21:14,860 --> 01:21:21,920
World hamster world eater hamster and normal dog you all take 21 points of damage. Oh

1445
01:21:21,920 --> 01:21:26,180
That's a lot no

1446
01:21:26,180 --> 01:21:30,540
Fuck I have one hit point as I'll heal you

1447
01:21:30,540 --> 01:21:59,540
I don't

1448
01:21:59,540 --> 01:22:12,540
take

1449
01:22:12,540 --> 01:22:20,940
Now, uh, uh, the candy hamster is going to move in closer, um, and shoot a payday missile.

1450
01:22:20,940 --> 01:22:21,940
*laughs*

1451
01:22:21,940 --> 01:22:22,940
Ah!

1452
01:22:22,940 --> 01:22:23,940
Uh...

1453
01:22:23,940 --> 01:22:25,940
That's so many peanuts!

1454
01:22:25,940 --> 01:22:29,940
Uh, right at, uh, uh, the man bear pig.

1455
01:22:29,940 --> 01:22:31,940
Um, so let's see how he does with that.

1456
01:22:31,940 --> 01:22:37,040
And he's... the man bear pig is able to just like, to tuck and roll out of the way of the

1457
01:22:37,040 --> 01:22:38,040
missile.

1458
01:22:38,040 --> 01:22:43,240
it explode into a disgusting peanut mess behind him.

1459
01:22:43,240 --> 01:22:48,640
And now it is your turn, motherfucking...

1460
01:22:48,640 --> 01:22:50,320
Oh, the squad!

1461
01:22:50,320 --> 01:22:51,560
It's the squad's turn.

1462
01:22:51,560 --> 01:22:56,920
So they're all gonna just roll up on him and try to surround him.

1463
01:22:56,920 --> 01:22:57,920
That's right.

1464
01:22:57,920 --> 01:22:58,920
Squad.

1465
01:22:58,920 --> 01:22:59,920
Squad up.

1466
01:22:59,920 --> 01:23:05,600
And so the squad of CIA agents that are now under your... that are now like your allies.

1467
01:23:05,600 --> 01:23:28,600
I'm

1468
01:23:28,600 --> 01:23:35,560
he's spinning too fast with that spin ability except one of them is able to hit him which

1469
01:23:35,560 --> 01:23:40,680
stops the spin ability in its tracks so that's no longer an issue you no longer have disadvantage

1470
01:23:40,680 --> 01:23:46,200
on those attacks nice and the candy hamster takes a sizable amount of damage actually

1471
01:23:46,200 --> 01:23:49,760
so you see all these CIA agents like trying to karate chop him and then one of them just

1472
01:23:49,760 --> 01:23:57,560
like bops him on the nose and the candy hamster's like like just in pain so now it is your turn

1473
01:23:57,560 --> 01:24:15,040
in

1474
01:24:15,040 --> 01:24:17,440
If you're thirsty, you can just drink water and revive.

1475
01:24:17,440 --> 01:24:18,840
You don't have to get it in the game.

1476
01:24:18,840 --> 01:24:23,040
No, I'm saying that the natural enemy of cotton candy is water.

1477
01:24:23,040 --> 01:24:24,040
Also, the...

1478
01:24:24,040 --> 01:24:25,040
Wait, hold up.

1479
01:24:25,040 --> 01:24:31,040
I feel like the cotton candy hamster is a lot closer to me now.

1480
01:24:31,040 --> 01:24:32,040
Yeah.

1481
01:24:32,040 --> 01:24:33,040
So...

1482
01:24:33,040 --> 01:24:35,760
What's the best thing I could do?

1483
01:24:35,760 --> 01:24:36,760
I think...

1484
01:24:36,760 --> 01:24:39,920
Okay, so I could check my inventory and then share it with somebody?

1485
01:24:39,920 --> 01:24:41,480
Or use it against the...

1486
01:24:41,480 --> 01:24:42,480
Alright.

1487
01:24:42,480 --> 01:24:43,960
Alright, you know what?

1488
01:24:43,960 --> 01:25:01,560
I'm

1489
01:25:01,560 --> 01:25:14,280
It does 3d10 + 5 attack damage and it has advantage against evil aligned creatures which this guy

1490
01:25:14,280 --> 01:25:15,460
is.

1491
01:25:15,460 --> 01:25:17,120
And you have double damage right?

1492
01:25:17,120 --> 01:25:18,120
Yes.

1493
01:25:18,120 --> 01:25:19,120
Oh my god.

1494
01:25:19,120 --> 01:25:24,260
So you just have this shiny, you reach into your mouth and pull out this shining gleaming

1495
01:25:24,260 --> 01:25:29,760
blade that you immediately know how to wield and is super powered.

1496
01:25:29,760 --> 01:25:30,260
Okay.

1497
01:25:30,260 --> 01:25:33,120
And I can use it right now?

1498
01:25:33,120 --> 01:25:33,940
Yeah.

1499
01:25:33,940 --> 01:25:36,580
Fuckin' let's go!

1500
01:25:36,580 --> 01:25:39,060
Oh no wait, sorry, shit, yeah, check inventories in action.

1501
01:25:39,060 --> 01:25:40,020
So you can't use it yet.

1502
01:25:40,020 --> 01:25:41,680
But you have it ready to go.

1503
01:25:41,680 --> 01:25:44,080
But your next turn's gonna be so lit, dude.

1504
01:25:44,080 --> 01:25:45,620
But I haven't moved, right?

1505
01:25:45,620 --> 01:25:47,140
No, so you can move.

1506
01:25:47,140 --> 01:25:55,740
So let's say, theoretically, I have the sword poking out in front of me while I move 15 feet.

1507
01:25:55,740 --> 01:25:57,660
You know what, write a persuasion check on the DM.

1508
01:25:57,660 --> 01:25:58,740
See if you can get it.

1509
01:25:58,740 --> 01:26:00,740
*laughter*

1510
01:26:00,740 --> 01:26:02,740
Woah an 18!

1511
01:26:02,740 --> 01:26:04,740
I think that's a fuckin'

1512
01:26:04,740 --> 01:26:06,740
I think that's a go!

1513
01:26:06,740 --> 01:26:08,740
So you see the DM looking at

1514
01:26:08,740 --> 01:26:10,740
what you're saying and

1515
01:26:10,740 --> 01:26:12,740
he's thinking about how many times he's let you do

1516
01:26:12,740 --> 01:26:14,740
just insane stupid shit

1517
01:26:14,740 --> 01:26:16,740
and he's like

1518
01:26:16,740 --> 01:26:18,740
and he's sort of just like

1519
01:26:18,740 --> 01:26:20,740
I don't wanna be the no guy

1520
01:26:20,740 --> 01:26:22,740
*laughter*

1521
01:26:22,740 --> 01:26:24,740
I kinda pride myself on

1522
01:26:24,740 --> 01:26:26,740
being the DM who can hang

1523
01:26:26,740 --> 01:26:28,740
*laughter*

1524
01:26:28,740 --> 01:26:30,740
I throw him a beer.

1525
01:26:30,740 --> 01:26:32,740
*laughter*

1526
01:26:32,740 --> 01:26:34,740
Come on! Live a little!

1527
01:26:34,740 --> 01:26:36,740
I give the DM one of these clown shoes

1528
01:26:36,740 --> 01:26:38,740
space cake double IPAs

1529
01:26:38,740 --> 01:26:40,740
and because it's a 9%

1530
01:26:40,740 --> 01:26:42,740
ABB he drinks one

1531
01:26:42,740 --> 01:26:44,740
and he's too fucked up.

1532
01:26:44,740 --> 01:26:46,740
Yeah, the DM is a baby's tolerance.

1533
01:26:46,740 --> 01:26:48,740
Yeah, the DM is a baby's tolerance.

1534
01:26:48,740 --> 01:26:50,740
He's like, you know what?

1535
01:26:50,740 --> 01:26:52,740
Roll a straight D20.

1536
01:26:52,740 --> 01:26:54,740
If you get higher than 10, you do an attack.

1537
01:26:54,740 --> 01:27:23,940
a

1538
01:27:23,940 --> 01:27:27,940
3 D10s plus 5.

1539
01:27:27,940 --> 01:27:31,940
I should have said that was going to be a plus 7 to hit too whenever you got to use it.

1540
01:27:31,940 --> 01:27:35,940
What did you do?

1541
01:27:35,940 --> 01:27:39,940
I rolled 3 D10s.

1542
01:27:39,940 --> 01:27:43,940
You set a cap that they have to be greater than 90.

1543
01:27:43,940 --> 01:27:47,940
Oh wait, wait, wait.

1544
01:27:47,940 --> 01:27:51,940
I didn't even know you could do that.

1545
01:27:51,940 --> 01:27:53,220
How did you make that happen?

1546
01:27:53,220 --> 01:28:00,180
Pat just made it so that he rolled 3d10s +5 and it had to be greater than 90 for him to succeed.

1547
01:28:00,180 --> 01:28:03,940
He rolled 3d10 +5 and the result was zero successes.

1548
01:28:03,940 --> 01:28:06,420
Well now I got three successes.

1549
01:28:06,420 --> 01:28:09,620
You are teaching me so much about rolling 20 times.

1550
01:28:09,620 --> 01:28:10,660
How are you doing this?

1551
01:28:10,660 --> 01:28:13,380
I now have three successes.

1552
01:28:13,380 --> 01:28:14,340
Fuck off.

1553
01:28:14,340 --> 01:28:15,620
That's like the first value.

1554
01:28:15,620 --> 01:28:16,100
It's good.

1555
01:28:16,100 --> 01:28:20,020
11 + 5 that's uh 14.

1556
01:28:20,020 --> 01:28:23,700
16 wow i'm having a patrick moment and we're gonna times that by two

1557
01:28:23,700 --> 01:28:28,900
You do 32 damage you fucking run up to this thing after persuading the df

1558
01:28:28,900 --> 01:28:34,020
And you just cleave through its cotton candy. Yes, and the candy hamster's like

1559
01:28:34,020 --> 01:28:36,980
Like just like in so much pain

1560
01:28:36,980 --> 01:28:39,220
um, uh

1561
01:28:39,220 --> 01:28:42,580
And it's like hanging now a little bit from its giant cotton candy body

1562
01:28:42,580 --> 01:28:48,260
Oh, yeah, I should have mentioned put this in cameron earlier. He also grows to like 30 feet in height

1563
01:28:48,740 --> 01:28:58,900
and 25 feet wide this giant hamster in size you know what i mean oh yeah penis exactly the same

1564
01:28:58,900 --> 01:29:05,220
looks crazy brother little hamster no no it's a twix bar look if my penis was any bigger it's

1565
01:29:05,220 --> 01:29:11,620
aerodynamic enough to do that last move so no no not you the candy hamster grosses out wow wow

1566
01:29:11,620 --> 01:29:13,620
Wow, what a narcissist.

1567
01:29:13,620 --> 01:29:15,620
Every hamster is you.

1568
01:29:15,620 --> 01:29:19,620
Look, every time we talk about a hamster's penis, it just grew.

1569
01:29:19,620 --> 01:29:22,620
I thought the candy hamster turned into the cotton candy dog.

1570
01:29:22,620 --> 01:29:25,620
Because he's a dog on the screen right now.

1571
01:29:25,620 --> 01:29:27,620
Just keep up, Patrick.

1572
01:29:27,620 --> 01:29:29,620
You are so dumb.

1573
01:29:29,620 --> 01:29:31,620
You're dumb like every human.

1574
01:29:31,620 --> 01:29:33,620
This makes so much sense.

1575
01:29:33,620 --> 01:29:35,620
You have the IQ of an egg.

1576
01:29:35,620 --> 01:29:36,620
Yeah, okay.

1577
01:29:36,620 --> 01:29:38,620
And an egg that hasn't even hatched yet.

1578
01:29:38,620 --> 01:29:40,620
After letting you do that.

1579
01:29:40,620 --> 01:29:43,620
It is now the very pleasant period.

1580
01:29:43,620 --> 01:29:52,260
Okay, um, hmm. See, I don't think any of my attacks are really good enough to justify

1581
01:29:52,260 --> 01:30:04,460
getting into melee range. Because I'll just die if I get hit, most likely. So, I might...

1582
01:30:04,460 --> 01:30:08,660
Is it safe to assume that if I use that new ability again that nothing's gonna happen?

1583
01:30:08,660 --> 01:30:10,660
Yeah, no. He's already resurrected everybody.

1584
01:30:10,660 --> 01:30:11,660
He's already resurrected everyone.

1585
01:30:11,660 --> 01:30:12,660
Yeah, yeah, okay.

1586
01:30:12,660 --> 01:30:15,660
Um, I'll just use the old crazy ability.

1587
01:30:15,660 --> 01:30:16,660
I'll use the old Farina.

1588
01:30:16,660 --> 01:30:18,660
I might fly away a little bit, actually.

1589
01:30:18,660 --> 01:30:20,660
Dennis Farina is what the ability's called.

1590
01:30:20,660 --> 01:30:21,660
Yeah.

1591
01:30:21,660 --> 01:30:22,660
Now.

1592
01:30:22,660 --> 01:30:23,660
After doing this Farina.

1593
01:30:23,660 --> 01:30:24,660
Do it, yeah.

1594
01:30:24,660 --> 01:30:25,660
Alright.

1595
01:30:25,660 --> 01:30:26,660
I mean, I don't know what to...

1596
01:30:26,660 --> 01:30:27,660
That does say...

1597
01:30:27,660 --> 01:30:28,660
Oh, yeah, sorry.

1598
01:30:28,660 --> 01:30:29,660
Rolled straight D20.

1599
01:30:29,660 --> 01:30:30,660
Oh, okay.

1600
01:30:30,660 --> 01:30:32,660
My apologies, love.

1601
01:30:32,660 --> 01:30:34,660
Oh, yeah.

1602
01:30:34,660 --> 01:30:35,660
Oh, yeah.

1603
01:30:35,660 --> 01:30:36,660
Alright.

1604
01:30:36,660 --> 01:30:49,020
the

1605
01:30:49,020 --> 01:30:56,460
right here. You just tell your eyes turn white again. They don't go like slots though and

1606
01:30:56,460 --> 01:31:02,940
you just teleport in place. You go to the ethereal plane. You see like you see like the

1607
01:31:02,940 --> 01:31:07,660
everyone looks like blue. Yeah, like you're seeing through it and then you just appear

1608
01:31:07,660 --> 01:31:16,660
right back in place. That's what happens to you with 10. I throw up motion sickness. Yeah.

1609
01:31:16,660 --> 01:31:20,240
It is now ManBearPig's turn.

1610
01:31:20,240 --> 01:31:28,380
After resisting the Twizzler Forest, he's gonna try to approach Candy's Hamster.

1611
01:31:28,380 --> 01:31:31,880
Fuck his ass up.

1612
01:31:31,880 --> 01:31:34,040
He fucking does awful.

1613
01:31:34,040 --> 01:31:35,260
He tries to bite him.

1614
01:31:35,260 --> 01:31:41,140
He tries again though, he's got two attacks.

1615
01:31:41,140 --> 01:31:45,380
Yeah that does hit.

1616
01:31:45,380 --> 01:31:47,700
And so he does damage now.

1617
01:31:47,700 --> 01:31:49,660
He just takes a chomp out of Candy Hamster.

1618
01:31:49,660 --> 01:31:51,340
He's like "Ahh!"

1619
01:31:51,340 --> 01:31:53,660
Like more of that noise.

1620
01:31:53,660 --> 01:31:54,660
He's not looking too good.

1621
01:31:54,660 --> 01:31:57,700
He's getting pretty fucked up right now.

1622
01:31:57,700 --> 01:31:58,700
We could do this guys.

1623
01:31:58,700 --> 01:31:59,700
We could.

1624
01:31:59,700 --> 01:32:00,700
We could really pull this off.

1625
01:32:00,700 --> 01:32:03,060
We're taking him down bro.

1626
01:32:03,060 --> 01:32:08,100
But you also see Candy Hamster in this fit.

1627
01:32:08,100 --> 01:32:10,280
You see him like his cotton candy.

1628
01:32:10,280 --> 01:32:15,660
of it start to repair and starts to heal. He's like, "Now you're making me mad!"

1629
01:32:15,660 --> 01:32:18,060
I had a system I developed for this, okay?

1630
01:32:18,060 --> 01:32:20,060
"I had a system I developed for this!"

1631
01:32:20,060 --> 01:32:21,060
"You developed a system?"

1632
01:32:21,060 --> 01:32:22,660
"I told him, shut the hell up."

1633
01:32:22,660 --> 01:32:28,500
I had two HP values and whenever one of them reached zero, that one would then be reabsorbed

1634
01:32:28,500 --> 01:32:30,500
into the big... nobody... I don't care.

1635
01:32:30,500 --> 01:32:31,860
"I don't even know what that means."

1636
01:32:31,860 --> 01:32:36,740
I'll show you guys later.

1637
01:32:36,740 --> 01:32:42,620
And uh, it is now, yeah you see his like, his cotton candy starts to fill up with other colors,

1638
01:32:42,620 --> 01:32:45,700
it's like he's repairing it with like, other kinds of cotton candy.

1639
01:32:45,700 --> 01:32:48,740
Um, and it is now Uncle Shredder's turn.

1640
01:32:48,740 --> 01:32:54,340
He's gonna try to now run up on this guy, he's pretty close, and use his uh, his shredder

1641
01:32:54,340 --> 01:32:55,340
claws.

1642
01:32:55,340 --> 01:32:56,340
Um, um, yeaaaaah.

1643
01:32:56,340 --> 01:33:05,780
Yeah he fuckin' hits him alright, yeah he fuckin' just slices him up, Uncle Shredder.

1644
01:33:05,780 --> 01:33:10,340
like this is for all the uncles everywhere and it's just like slicing up this hamster.

1645
01:33:10,340 --> 01:33:16,740
It's for my brother Rob and uh that's right I'm uncle shredder blakowicz and uh

1646
01:33:16,740 --> 01:33:17,740
YAAAAAAA

The reveal.

1648
01:33:20,260 --> 01:33:27,820
Everyone in the crowd at the concert starts cheering.

1649
01:33:27,820 --> 01:33:32,260
This is like a break dance circle at the STAN concert.

1650
01:33:32,260 --> 01:33:35,260
the song whatever uh... it's been a while

1651
01:33:35,260 --> 01:33:38,500

1652
01:33:38,500 --> 01:33:42,260

1653
01:33:42,260 --> 01:33:46,100
uh... and it is now uh...

1654
01:33:46,100 --> 01:33:48,340

1662
01:34:12,540 --> 01:34:17,180

1663
01:34:17,180 --> 01:34:20,220

y'all might be kind of right all right i use tongue of tranquility

1665
01:34:24,460 --> 01:34:27,740
Yeah, it heals everyone for 2d8 plus 4 hit points.

1666
01:34:27,740 --> 01:34:30,460
So roll for that to see how much you heal everyone.

1667
01:34:30,460 --> 01:34:31,820
So I roll 2d8s?

1668
01:34:31,820 --> 01:34:32,820
Not you!

1669
01:34:32,820 --> 01:34:33,820
No, no, no.

1670
01:34:33,820 --> 01:34:34,820
Just, just, just, just.

1671
01:34:34,820 --> 01:34:36,540
Sorry, are you the weird one?

1672
01:34:36,540 --> 01:34:37,540
Yeah.

1673
01:34:37,540 --> 01:34:38,540
Just strange dog.

1674
01:34:38,540 --> 01:34:40,940
And add 4, so 15 hit points.

1675
01:34:40,940 --> 01:34:45,860
So your tongue scoots around to everyone's butthole on your team, including all the agents.

1676
01:34:45,860 --> 01:34:48,580
Do I put something in their butt?

1677
01:34:48,580 --> 01:34:53,300
No, you just lick it in a way that is really healing.

1678
01:34:53,300 --> 01:35:10,540
he

1679
01:35:10,540 --> 01:35:17,500
yeah yeah yeah oh my god it's amazing dude yeah and uh yeah you heal all them good

1683
01:35:33,580 --> 01:35:34,580
*laughter*

1684
01:35:34,580 --> 01:35:36,580
It's the other candy hamster's turn.

1685
01:35:36,580 --> 01:35:39,580
And uh, the candy hamster is going to uh

1686
01:35:39,580 --> 01:35:41,580
*growls*

1687
01:35:41,580 --> 01:35:45,580
He's like squeezing out these uh, uh

1688
01:35:45,580 --> 01:35:49,580
A couple of uh, things are sort of starting to squeeze out of him.

1689
01:35:49,580 --> 01:35:53,580
These uh, motherfucking gumdrop villains appear on the screen.

1690
01:35:53,580 --> 01:35:55,580
*laughter*

1691
01:35:55,580 --> 01:35:57,580
Gumdrop villains.

1692
01:35:57,580 --> 01:36:05,580
and they're these like 10 foot by 10 foot nasty scheming looking gumdrop villains

1693
01:36:05,580 --> 01:36:07,580
these guys look sick

1694
01:36:07,580 --> 01:36:09,580
I hate these guys already

1695
01:36:09,580 --> 01:36:11,580
and he squeezes out two of them

1696
01:36:11,580 --> 01:36:13,580
and they're gonna have to go for their own initiative

1697
01:36:13,580 --> 01:36:17,580
and they're in the turn order now

1698
01:36:17,580 --> 01:36:19,580
and you see them go "go my gumdrop villains"

1699
01:36:19,580 --> 01:36:21,580
and you see them go

1700
01:36:21,580 --> 01:36:23,580
and they're just like

1701
01:36:23,580 --> 01:36:25,580
like just plodding

1702
01:36:25,580 --> 01:36:30,340
are rubbing together. You see little gumdrop juices are sliding out of their hands as they

1703
01:36:30,340 --> 01:36:33,020
rub them together. It's very upsetting.

1704
01:36:33,020 --> 01:36:41,900
Um, yeah, you see them doing that. And then, uh, Candy Hamster's like, you can see he's

1705
01:36:41,900 --> 01:36:48,820
starting to get desperate. He's not looking too good. And so he, uh, he says, "It's time.

1706
01:36:48,820 --> 01:36:55,020
It's time to unleash the ultimate attack. I'll never let you have parents. They're my parents!"

1707
01:36:55,020 --> 01:37:06,780
And his cotton candy body turns completely silver like Metal's Mario.

1708
01:37:06,780 --> 01:37:12,860
And then you see everything around you turn into a black space.

1709
01:37:12,860 --> 01:37:21,500
And you see from the sky a giant Tootsie Roll appears as a meteor.

1710
01:37:21,500 --> 01:37:27,620
just floating in space in like 3D like PS2 graphics and all of you what is your

1711
01:37:27,620 --> 01:37:42,420
least favorite kind of candy? Necco wafer. Baby Ruth. No you can't trick no you're

1712

a hell for that world of candy

1747
01:40:24,640 --> 01:40:25,840
pleasant parrot

1748
01:40:25,840 --> 01:40:27,400

1749
01:40:27,400 --> 01:40:36,560

1751
01:40:41,560 --> 01:40:50,960
you're dead oh my god the hungry hamster is gone and now now you don't even have

1752
01:40:50,960 --> 01:40:55,760
you don't have to worry about this Patrick you know I mean hungry hamster

1753
01:40:55,760 --> 01:41:02,260
but you're, yeah, the psychic damage of a foot in your mouth just like exploded your skull basically on the ground.

1754
01:41:02,260 --> 01:41:06,260
Yeah, you could still come back if people were biting you, but...

1755
01:41:06,260 --> 01:41:07,760
Okay, I refuse to revive you.

1756
01:41:07,760 --> 01:41:13,760
Normal dog, a strange dog I should say, with that saving throw, you're also now paralyzed and frightened.

1757
01:41:13,760 --> 01:41:16,760
Paralyzed and frightened?

1758
01:41:16,760 --> 01:41:19,760
You're incapacitated, you can't move or speak.

1759
01:41:19,760 --> 01:41:21,760
Any attack roll against you has advantage.

1760
01:41:21,760 --> 01:41:25,760
Any attack that hits you is a critical hit if the attacker is within 5 feet of you.

1761
01:41:25,760 --> 01:41:28,760
You automatically fail Strength and Dexterity saving throws.

1762
01:41:28,760 --> 01:41:30,760
You have disadvantage on Ability checks and Attack rolls.

1763
01:41:30,760 --> 01:41:33,760
All the source of your fear is within line of sight.

1764
01:41:33,760 --> 01:41:36,760
And you can't willingly move close to that source of fear.

1765
01:41:36,760 --> 01:41:40,760
Okay, but can you at least admit that I'm a bit weird and I might like something like that?

1766
01:41:40,760 --> 01:41:43,760
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I can admit that.

1767
01:41:43,760 --> 01:41:44,760
Okay.

1768
01:41:44,760 --> 01:41:45,760
For you.

1769
01:41:45,760 --> 01:41:46,760
Moving on.

1770
01:41:46,760 --> 01:41:49,760
And you, you managed to resist it though.

1771
01:41:49,760 --> 01:41:52,480
a pleasant parrot, very pleasant parrot

1772
01:41:52,480 --> 01:41:53,680
close one

1773
01:41:53,680 --> 01:41:55,840
and now, now

1774
01:41:55,840 --> 01:41:58,880
it is the squad's turn

1775
01:41:58,880 --> 01:42:02,800
so they're gonna try their best to beat the shit out of this guy

1776
01:42:02,800 --> 01:42:06,160
please squad

1777
01:42:06,160 --> 01:42:08,480
please squad, please revive me

1778
01:42:08,480 --> 01:42:10,560
can the squad revive me?

1779
01:42:10,560 --> 01:42:13,840
these are my woes right now dude

1780
01:42:13,840 --> 01:42:15,520
I need a revival from the squad

1781
01:42:15,520 --> 01:42:18,880
and that's on period

1782
01:42:18,880 --> 01:42:25,520
I'm with my woes right now at the at the stain concert. Can I get a can I get a revival from the squad and that's on period

1783
01:42:25,520 --> 01:42:30,320
The squad instead of doing that continues to beat up on the hungry hamster

1784
01:42:30,320 --> 01:42:31,840
um

1785
01:42:31,840 --> 01:42:37,040
And all they know is I mean, sorry the candy hamster and the candy hamster is looking pretty messed up

1786
01:42:37,040 --> 01:42:41,440
No, stop get away from me. They do like a solid 18 damage to him

1787
01:42:41,440 --> 01:42:43,760
um, and now

1788
01:42:43,760 --> 01:42:45,760
it is

1789
01:42:45,920 --> 01:42:48,080
uh... world leader hamster

1790
01:42:48,080 --> 01:42:50,240
we're doing death saving throws

1791
01:42:50,240 --> 01:42:53,340
so what this is, we haven't done this in the game yet

1792
01:42:53,340 --> 01:42:56,840
or we did maybe once? We did it once, I think.

1793
01:42:56,840 --> 01:42:58,600
so you roll a d20

1794
01:42:58,600 --> 01:43:03,100
if you get above a ten, it's a success, if it's below a ten, it's a failure

1795
01:43:03,100 --> 01:43:05,560
so crit 20 you get two successes

1796
01:43:05,560 --> 01:43:08,520
crit 1 you get two failures

1797
01:43:08,520 --> 01:43:14,200
if you get three successes you're revived, if you get three failures you're permanently dead

1798
01:43:14,200 --> 01:43:15,200
So roll a d20.

1799
01:43:15,200 --> 01:43:16,200
Me?

1800
01:43:16,200 --> 01:43:17,200
Do it.

1801
01:43:17,200 --> 01:43:18,200
Yeah.

1802
01:43:18,200 --> 01:43:19,200
I thought you were talking to Cameron.

1803
01:43:19,200 --> 01:43:20,200
I got a 14.

1804
01:43:20,200 --> 01:43:21,200
That's a success baby.

1805
01:43:21,200 --> 01:43:22,200
You feel yourself fighting for life.

1806
01:43:22,200 --> 01:43:23,200
Like, and you're able to sort of catch a little bit of breath maybe as blood starts to build

1807
01:43:23,200 --> 01:43:24,200
up in your throat.

1808
01:43:24,200 --> 01:43:25,200
You're starting to maybe come back.

1809
01:43:25,200 --> 01:43:26,200
I feel like blood building up in his throat is not a great sign.

1810
01:43:26,200 --> 01:43:27,200
Yeah.

1811
01:43:27,200 --> 01:43:28,200
Maybe he'll swallow it okay.

1812
01:43:28,200 --> 01:43:29,200
Maybe you like blood.

1813
01:43:29,200 --> 01:43:30,200
I don't know.

1814
01:43:30,200 --> 01:43:31,200
I don't know.

1815
01:43:31,200 --> 01:43:32,200
I don't know.

1816
01:43:32,200 --> 01:43:33,200
I don't know.

1817
01:43:33,200 --> 01:43:34,200
I don't know.

1818
01:43:34,200 --> 01:43:35,200
I don't know.

1819
01:43:35,200 --> 01:43:36,200
I don't know.

1820
01:43:36,200 --> 01:43:37,200
I don't know.

1821
01:43:37,200 --> 01:43:38,200
I don't know.

1822
01:43:38,200 --> 01:43:39,200
I don't know.

1823
01:43:39,200 --> 01:43:40,200
I don't know.

1824
01:43:40,200 --> 01:43:41,200
I don't know.

1825
01:43:41,200 --> 01:43:44,200
Maybe you like blood.

1826
01:43:44,200 --> 01:43:48,200
Hey, I'm hungry as hell and that tastes like a steak to me right now.

1827
01:43:48,200 --> 01:43:49,200
That's right.

1828
01:43:49,200 --> 01:43:51,200
Very pleasant parrot, it is now your turn.

1829
01:43:51,200 --> 01:43:57,200
Okay, I look at strange dog and I use my Polly wants a what now ability to give him a one word command.

1830
01:43:57,200 --> 01:44:00,200
And I say, um, unparalyze.

1831
01:44:00,200 --> 01:44:03,200
Please.

1832
01:44:03,200 --> 01:44:06,200
I can't, no, it's not how that works.

1833
01:44:06,200 --> 01:44:08,200
I can't let you do that.

1834
01:44:08,200 --> 01:44:10,200
Wait, say antidote.

1835
01:44:10,200 --> 01:44:12,920
That makes even less sense.

1836
01:44:12,920 --> 01:44:15,560
No, it's a paralysis antidote.

1837
01:44:15,560 --> 01:44:17,000
It's not a command.

1838
01:44:17,000 --> 01:44:19,960
You can't make someone antidote.

1839
01:44:19,960 --> 01:44:21,160
No, you can.

1840
01:44:21,160 --> 01:44:25,320
Oh, can I look at Patrick and say "Live"?

1841
01:44:25,320 --> 01:44:28,120
Wait, that could happen.

1842
01:44:28,120 --> 01:44:32,280
It's not quite how the command spell works.

1843
01:44:32,280 --> 01:44:34,200
Yeah, I figured.

1844
01:44:34,200 --> 01:44:37,320
Man, I don't really--

1845
01:44:37,320 --> 01:44:38,840
Wait, look at me and say "Revive."

1846
01:44:38,840 --> 01:44:39,840
I think it might.

1847
01:44:39,840 --> 01:44:43,040
I think it's not going to work.

1848
01:44:43,040 --> 01:44:47,160
I think it might.

1849
01:44:47,160 --> 01:44:49,160
I uh...

1850
01:44:49,160 --> 01:44:53,400
There's really not much I can do to help my friends.

1851
01:44:53,400 --> 01:45:00,600
Wait, wait, look at the candy hamster and say "die."

1852
01:45:00,600 --> 01:45:02,440
It can't be harmful to them.

1853
01:45:02,440 --> 01:45:06,360
Well, then say "eat what you're allergic to."

1854
01:45:06,360 --> 01:45:14,220
Okay, I'm going to move on with my turn.

1855
01:45:14,220 --> 01:45:18,780
I think probably the best thing I can do is not get killed because I don't have anything

1856
01:45:18,780 --> 01:45:19,780
that can help.

1857
01:45:19,780 --> 01:45:21,620
I don't have any healing or anything.

1858
01:45:21,620 --> 01:45:24,420
We can take care of ourselves.

1859
01:45:24,420 --> 01:45:25,420
Yeah.

1860
01:45:25,420 --> 01:45:26,420
Yeah.

1861
01:45:26,420 --> 01:45:27,420
You guys can.

1862
01:45:27,420 --> 01:45:28,420
I need help.

1863
01:45:28,420 --> 01:45:29,420
Big boys in hell.

1864
01:45:29,420 --> 01:45:30,420
I'm weird.

1865
01:45:30,420 --> 01:45:33,420
Man, I'm just going to use my Dilophoran again.

1866
01:45:33,420 --> 01:45:34,420
Yeah, do it.

1867
01:45:34,420 --> 01:45:51,520
run again. Yeah, do it. Okay. 17. Okay. Oh boy. Okay, yeah. So here's what happens. Your

1868
01:45:51,520 --> 01:45:54,820
eyes turn white once again with this dark power. You don't know where it came from.

1869
01:45:54,820 --> 01:46:00,700
You don't know how it happened. You start to remember some experiments and stuff. And

1870
01:46:00,700 --> 01:46:05,700
outside of your mouth comes these incredibly strange energy beams

1871
01:46:05,700 --> 01:46:09,860
that carry with them a dark necrotic power

1872
01:46:09,860 --> 01:46:12,100
and they begin to

1873
01:46:12,100 --> 01:46:15,740
flood out of your open beak

1874
01:46:15,740 --> 01:46:19,060
and corral around the candy monster

1875
01:46:19,060 --> 01:46:20,740
and squeeze

1876
01:46:20,740 --> 01:46:24,960
and drain it. You see its skeletons start to poke through

1877
01:46:24,960 --> 01:46:28,560
the cotton candy elements of it

1878
01:46:28,560 --> 01:46:31,360
what kind of candies a skeleton made out of?

1879
01:46:31,360 --> 01:46:33,640
cookies and cream bar

1880
01:46:33,640 --> 01:46:35,560
carved into a skeleton

1881
01:46:35,560 --> 01:46:38,100
uh... and

1882
01:46:38,100 --> 01:46:39,600
uh...

1883
01:46:39,600 --> 01:46:44,760
you watch the candy hamster die before your eyes turn to it

1884
01:46:44,760 --> 01:46:47,640
and you also watch it

I'm supposed to be doing the King Tut.

1900
01:47:39,200 --> 01:47:42,200
Yeah, you hear the Homeward Bound music swirling,

1901
01:47:42,200 --> 01:47:45,200
you see the gumdrop villains vanish,

1902
01:47:45,200 --> 01:47:50,200
the Twizzler forest that killed about 37 people in the crowd

1903
01:47:50,200 --> 01:47:52,200
also vanish,

1904
01:47:52,200 --> 01:47:56,200
the agents start to poof away.

1905
01:47:56,200 --> 01:47:57,200
I can't believe you got this.

1906
01:47:57,200 --> 01:47:58,200
No!

1907
01:47:58,200 --> 01:48:02,200
And you see now the candy hamster just like hovering there,

1908
01:48:02,200 --> 01:48:04,200
mouth agape,

1909
01:48:04,200 --> 01:48:07,200
Um, and it does this for...

1910
01:48:07,200 --> 01:48:12,200
He's on our side but we should still like beat the shit out of him just cause he can.

1911
01:48:12,200 --> 01:48:14,200
Yeah, actually yeah.

1912
01:48:14,200 --> 01:48:20,200
Yeah, the candy ham- the candy hamster turns around and just starts chasing after the band, Stained.

1913
01:48:20,200 --> 01:48:23,200
Um, cause it just goes after the nearest person to it.

1914
01:48:23,200 --> 01:48:26,200
So it just starts running after Stained.

1915
01:48:26,200 --> 01:48:29,200
And Stained just is running from this undead candy hamster.

1916
01:48:29,200 --> 01:48:33,200
And your family runs up to you and "Oh, we were so worried about all of you!"

1917
01:48:33,200 --> 01:48:37,440
of you. We found out you were missing after Uncle Shredder said he told you to run from

1918
01:48:37,440 --> 01:48:47,440
the cops. We love you so much. We'll never make you guys go homeward bound again.

1919
01:48:47,440 --> 01:48:49,680

1920
01:48:49,680 --> 01:48:54,300
- Thanks, man.

1921
01:48:54,300 --> 01:48:58,160
- And it fades to black.

01:48:58,160 --> 01:49:01,160
Comes up. - Oh my God.

1923
01:49:01,160 --> 01:49:07,800
- And you see a beautiful house,

1924
01:49:07,800 --> 01:49:11,000
once again, just outside of Chicago.

1925
01:49:11,000 --> 01:49:14,560
It's now the winter, winter-ish, fall-ish.

1926
01:49:14,560 --> 01:49:17,160
You see a big turkey in the kitchen window.

01:49:17,160 --> 01:49:19,000

01:49:39,360 --> 01:49:42,240
to teach him how to do that eating john cena

1937
01:49:42,240 --> 01:49:46,560

01:49:48,680 --> 01:49:52,280
and you see Uncle Shredder putting his arm around ManBearPig.

1940
01:49:52,280 --> 01:49:54,860

1941
01:49:54,860 --> 01:49:58,640
And what do you guys say?

1942
01:49:58,640 --> 01:49:59,520
- You hear like an audience,

1943
01:49:59,520 --> 01:50:02,120
you hear like a full house like, "Aww."

1944
01:50:02,120 --> 01:50:03,460
- Yeah.

1945
01:50:03,460 --> 01:50:07,800
- What do you guys say as the credits roll on "Hamward Bound"?

1946
01:50:07,800 --> 01:50:09,400
- Pass the stomach!

1947
01:50:09,400 --> 01:50:11,960
- Are you full?

1948
01:50:11,960 --> 01:50:14,760
- I've already eaten most of the dinner.

1949
01:50:15,860 --> 01:50:18,180
I'm smoking a cigarette outside.

1950
01:50:18,180 --> 01:50:19,780
Yeah, you're now strange.

1951
01:50:19,780 --> 01:50:20,780
Yeah, I'm strange.

01:50:20,780 --> 01:50:21,620
Yeah, I get I'm strange.

1953
01:50:21,620 --> 01:50:22,740
I'm wearing a leather jacket.

1954
01:50:22,740 --> 01:50:25,340
They had to make you see what's dinner for me.

1955
01:50:25,340 --> 01:50:27,020
I'm smoking a cigarette with all my cousins

1956
01:50:27,020 --> 01:50:28,780
outside at Thanksgiving.

1957
01:50:28,780 --> 01:50:30,980
And just being like, "Uncles are bullshit."

1958
01:50:30,980 --> 01:50:36,660
I put my wings around WorldEaterHamster

1959
01:50:36,660 --> 01:50:40,180
and StrangeDog and I say, "I love my friends."

1960
01:50:40,180 --> 01:50:42,860
And John Cena, little John Cena Blagojevich

1961
01:50:42,860 --> 01:50:44,940
and Scrooge Blagojevich come out

1962
01:50:44,940 --> 01:50:50,380
and they say, "Come on guys, you're gonna miss the turkey dinner and we think ManBearPig's gonna push!"

1963
01:50:50,380 --> 01:50:52,380
And they run inside.

1964
01:50:52,380 --> 01:50:57,260
And yeah, you guys go inside and the end.

1965
01:50:57,260 --> 01:50:59,260
It's the end of Hamward Bound.

1966
01:50:59,260 --> 01:51:01,260
Another masterpiece.

1967
01:51:01,260 --> 01:51:02,220
Wow.

1968
01:51:02,220 --> 01:51:02,780
Beautiful.

1969
01:51:02,780 --> 01:51:03,500
The greatest.

1970
01:51:03,500 --> 01:51:07,980
A clump of cotton candy blows behind the winds like a tumbleweed.

1971
01:51:07,980 --> 01:51:09,980
[laughter]

1972
01:51:09,980 --> 01:51:12,300
Perfect.

1973
01:51:12,300 --> 01:51:14,300
For Hamward Bound 2.

1974
01:51:14,300 --> 01:51:15,300
Yeah, yeah, right.

1975
01:51:15,300 --> 01:51:16,300
Yeah, yeah.

1976
01:51:16,300 --> 01:51:18,500
It ends with one of those Hans Zimmer bass hits.

1977
01:51:18,500 --> 01:51:19,500
Yeah.

1978
01:51:19,500 --> 01:51:20,500
A piece of cotton candy.

1979
01:51:20,500 --> 01:51:21,500
See that popular idiot face?

1980
01:51:21,500 --> 01:51:22,500
Yeah.

1981
01:51:22,500 --> 01:51:23,500
Oh, man.

All right, great.

Good shit.

Yeah, great job, guys.

Thanks for sticking with me.

1987
01:51:28,500 --> 01:51:29,500
I'm going to stop there.
