00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:14,760
No you're not. You're not recording.

6
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:16,760
I'm recording. Check out this.

7
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:18,760
Check out this.

8
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:20,760
Are you in the stew right now? Are you in the booth?

9
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:22,760
Play Dig. Play Dig.

10
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:24,760
Oh yeah.

11
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:26,760
Wait.

12
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:28,760
[Singing]

13
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:35,760
We're gonna get stricken for copyright.

14
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:39,760
Longest metal scream ever.

15
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:40,760
That's terrifying.

16
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:43,760
This is so we can text right off the bass.

17
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:48,760
You have to play one full song on the show at some point.

18
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:50,760
You have to play the new theme song.

19
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:55,760
True. We could have like a bass theme song.

20
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:58,160
Yeah, wait, can you just add a bass track to the theme song?

21
00:00:58,160 --> 00:00:59,160
That's the perfect thing to add.

22
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:00,160
Yeah, that's not a bad idea, honestly.

23
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:03,860
It does not change it at all, just this overlay, the bass playing.

24
00:01:03,860 --> 00:01:04,860
Yeah.

25
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:09,760
Pat, right before we started recording, you said that children can have tumors.

26
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:11,560
That's actually true.

27
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:17,660
Caleb said that his 1,000 friends who are all one-year-old children will live forever.

28
00:01:17,660 --> 00:01:18,960
They won't live forever, but if I have--

29
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:19,960
You literally just said that.

30
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:20,460
No, no, no, no, no.

31
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:21,060
You said that.

32
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:23,360
You said that you'll be friends with kids forever.

33
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:24,360
Sometimes I'm not wrong.

34
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:25,460
Sometimes I'm wrong.

35
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:28,900
listen you said you'd be proud of you want to have a very you should have it

36
00:01:28,900 --> 00:01:32,340
the youngest friends possible because in this is a business

37
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:36,780
uh... smaller chance of them on dying and you having no friend what they are going

38
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:40,580
to use that only works on the youngest people

39
00:01:40,580 --> 00:01:41,700
money

40
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:45,660
it could spread like wildfire through their ranks right like a brain tumor

41
00:01:45,660 --> 00:01:47,240
yeah i think it's a good work

42
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:52,180
but i was a kid my my mom brought uh... me and my brother to this kids house

43
00:01:52,180 --> 00:01:57,700
who had like, he was like my age or maybe a little younger, he was like 11, and he had

44
00:01:57,700 --> 00:02:01,020
some sort of like terminal cancer, and she was like, "Yeah, we're gonna go and like

45
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:05,240
cheer him up." And we like walked in, it's just some sad bald kid on like a hospice

46
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:10,560
bed in his house, and... Now that's your mirror. Now it's my mirror, exactly.

47
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:15,500
Woo! Let's go! My mom was like, "Yeah, you wanna like hang out with him?" And I was like, "No."

48
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:19,340
And then I went upstairs and I played with his toys.

49
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:25,520
and he just had to listen to like all these adults like fucking pray over him

50
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:34,920
or whatever yeah and just hear from upstairs yeah yeah just the noise of

51
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:39,880
you just just throwing his toys against the wall yeah it's a toy shot all these

52
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:44,960
toys suck dude no wonder he's walking or dying I don't want to play with this

53
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:54,140
kids toys I'm gonna catch his cancer yeah anyway he died like a week after that

54
00:02:54,140 --> 00:03:08,980
his last memory with another kid was me and then I went upstairs I played with

55
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:19,100
Just walking, just walking downstairs with like the huge bulging kangaroo hoodie

56
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:23,140
pocket and be like alright nice to meet you kids see you later and he goes

57
00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:29,820
upstairs and just like does an empty room. Take all his toys. Luckily I don't think he was

58
00:03:29,820 --> 00:03:34,900
physically able to go upstairs so yeah he never saw his room again he doesn't

59
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:37,020
You know what I did in that room?

60
00:03:37,020 --> 00:03:38,020
His mom does though.

61
00:03:38,020 --> 00:03:39,020
Those walls can talk.

62
00:03:39,020 --> 00:03:40,020
That's right.

63
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:41,020
They can talk about Caleb's playtime.

64
00:03:41,020 --> 00:03:45,020
Yeah, they talk about me putting these transformers in my mouth.

65
00:03:45,020 --> 00:03:46,020
It's tough, dude.

66
00:03:46,020 --> 00:03:47,020
What have you guys been up to?

67
00:03:47,020 --> 00:03:50,220
I haven't talked to you guys in so long.

68
00:03:50,220 --> 00:03:51,940
I've been playing the bass, dude.

69
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:52,940
Nice.

70
00:03:52,940 --> 00:03:53,940
Check this out.

71
00:03:53,940 --> 00:03:54,940
Check this out.

72
00:03:54,940 --> 00:03:57,820
Oh, fucking.

73
00:03:57,820 --> 00:03:59,620
It's when I try to show off.

74
00:03:59,620 --> 00:04:00,940
Every time you try and show off, you fuck it up.

75
00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:01,940
He played it well earlier.

76
00:04:01,940 --> 00:04:03,460
Oh, it's just me.

77
00:04:03,460 --> 00:04:04,460
I'm making you nervous, dude.

78
00:04:04,460 --> 00:04:08,460
You know that I'm a musical genius, a prodigy, a protégé.

79
00:04:08,460 --> 00:04:11,460
Okay, play it again.

80
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:12,460
That was "You Can't Touch This"?

81
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:13,460
Okay, play it again.

82
00:04:13,460 --> 00:04:14,460
Oh, nice.

83
00:04:14,460 --> 00:04:17,460
Is it "You Can't Touch This" or "Can't Touch This"?

84
00:04:17,460 --> 00:04:19,460
It's "We Can't Touch This."

85
00:04:19,460 --> 00:04:21,460
It's "I Can't Touch This."

86
00:04:21,460 --> 00:04:25,460
So that's great to learn because you also learned "Super Freak."

87
00:04:25,460 --> 00:04:26,460
True.

88
00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:27,460
By Rick James.

89
00:04:27,460 --> 00:04:29,460
Yeah, your favorite song.

90
00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:31,460
Because it's about me.

91
00:04:31,460 --> 00:04:32,460
It's about you.

92
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:33,460
I'm the super freak.

93
00:04:33,460 --> 00:04:35,460
You are the freakiest one, dude.

94
00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:35,960
Yeah.

95
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:37,460
Yeah, you have naughty ideas.

96
00:04:37,460 --> 00:04:39,460
[Music]

97
00:04:39,460 --> 00:04:41,460
Yeah, he has naughty ideas about BoJack Horseman.

98
00:04:41,460 --> 00:04:43,460
[Music]

99
00:04:43,460 --> 00:04:45,460
That's right. That's absolutely right.

100
00:04:45,460 --> 00:04:47,460
A lot of people got very mad at me for that.

101
00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:49,460
What did you even say?

102
00:04:49,460 --> 00:04:51,460
Somebody made like...

103
00:04:51,460 --> 00:04:53,460
All he said was "I love comedy."

104
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:55,460
Oh yeah, someone made some post that was like

105
00:04:55,460 --> 00:04:57,460
"They have a fat person in this show, and that's so brave."

106
00:04:57,460 --> 00:04:59,460
Yeah, and then they were like

107
00:04:59,460 --> 00:05:01,460
"They all thought that I was attacking the person who posted it."

108
00:05:01,460 --> 00:05:05,380
posted it, it's like, no, I just think BoJack sucks.

109
00:05:05,380 --> 00:05:07,540
- Yeah, also just that being like,

110
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:09,700
the reason you watch a comedy show.

111
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:10,540
- Yeah.

112
00:05:10,540 --> 00:05:11,620
- It's like, well, it's not very funny,

113
00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:13,620
but they do have a fat guy.

114
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:14,460
- Yeah.

115
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:15,300
- Yeah.

116
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:17,620
- It's not, you know, Tommy Boy wasn't funny,

117
00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:19,020
but there was a fat guy in it.

118
00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:20,380
- There is a fat, yeah.

119
00:05:20,380 --> 00:05:21,460
- Yeah.

120
00:05:21,460 --> 00:05:22,340
- Exactly, dude.

121
00:05:22,340 --> 00:05:26,660
Fucking Uncle Buck is amazing fat guy representation.

122
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:27,500
- Yeah.

123
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:28,320
- I put the bass down.

124
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:29,160
- Yeah.

125
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:31,220
- Thank God, okay, now we can actually start.

126
00:05:31,220 --> 00:05:33,220
What are you talking about? I was on fire.

127
00:05:33,220 --> 00:05:35,220
I was on fire, dude.

128
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:37,220
I'm a huge fan of the...

129
00:05:37,220 --> 00:05:39,220
I had some amazing solos.

130
00:05:39,220 --> 00:05:41,220
I'm a huge fan of the clumps, because it depicts

131
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:43,220
how kind of a whole family can be crazy.

132
00:05:43,220 --> 00:05:45,220
True. That's kind of

133
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:47,220
an intersectional movie.

134
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:49,220
A bunch of fat black people.

135
00:05:49,220 --> 00:05:51,220
It's a bunch of different people could be fat in a movie.

136
00:05:51,220 --> 00:05:53,220
That's true, yeah.

137
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:55,220
A bunch of fat people could be Eddie Murphy.

138
00:05:55,220 --> 00:05:57,220
I would say Norbit is the most

139
00:05:57,220 --> 00:05:59,220
intersectional movie of all time.

140
00:05:59,220 --> 00:06:04,180
a fat person and a skinny person could be Eddie Murphy. And they never make fun of his weight.

141
00:06:04,180 --> 00:06:09,480
They never make light of it. He's proud of it. Exactly. There's no jokes about it and

142
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:16,480
it's not meant to look disgusting. Or like a giant quivering ball of fat that's just

143
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:21,220
like revolting to see. It's not supposed to be that. It is funny that nobody does prosthetic

144
00:06:21,220 --> 00:06:28,220
fat anymore. No. You just get Rebel Wilson. Christian Bale ruined all of that. You don't

145
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:32,760
get the clumps anymore because he showed how dedicated he was to gaining weight.

146
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:36,040
Actors think it's cool to get fat and get skinny. I've been doing that every two

147
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:42,200
years my entire life. Me too. In two years I've hit my peak. In two years I'm gonna go back

148
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:47,600
down to being a string bean. Yeah. I was gaining all this weight for the role of Patrick on the podcast.

149
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:52,500
I think my next step is I'm gonna be like Arnold Schwarzenegger ripped. I'm thinking.

150
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:58,000
I think that's gonna happen for me in a few weeks. Dude, if you got crazy ripped it would be scary.

151
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:04,160
That would be so funny dude just all of a sudden just like six four like 210 pounds

152
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:10,880
yeah muscle just shredded you look at Fabio oh you're gonna make me act up

153
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:14,320
you got me actually thinking I'm actually you got me riled I'm gonna

154
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:18,320
round Patrick I wish there was a chip better not that Apple could put in my

155
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:21,880
brain that kept me from thinking I wish there was a chip that was wavy and had

156
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:30,640
flavor I wish they cooked a chip in a kettle I wish they made a chip with pepper and and

157
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:36,900
some other ingredient that I can't think of you know okay so you know barbecue you

158
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:43,960
know barbecue food imagine if that was a chip what is the latte chip man I was

159
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:49,680
10 years ago I wish there was a chip that Lays made called the Lays chip you

160
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:54,280
know in in like Australia and then Australia and in England they don't call

166
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:26,800
different thing I think I finally got coffee breath for the first time I think

167
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:32,920
I was I was wondering what if there was like a smell and it's just my breath

168
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:37,720
mm-hmm yeah last night I thought so oh here's a big thing that's been happening

last two weeks what I don't feel safe in my own home why because we have a rat a

170

happy they fill their balls with fucking silicone yeah it's dangerous they fill

311
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:52,060
them up with silicone and then they put them in vacuum sealers like they get

312
00:16:52,060 --> 00:16:56,700
custom vacuum sealers and then they inflate their balls until they look like

313
00:16:56,700 --> 00:17:01,580
like the fuck they look like bubble buddy from Spongebob pretty much like

00:17:09,620 --> 00:17:14,420
about okay the thing about the like unlocking like like HP Lovecraft thought

317
00:17:14,420 --> 00:17:18,380
that unlocking forbidden knowledge was gonna be about like oh you discovered the

318
00:17:18,380 --> 00:17:22,740
old God or the origin of the universe but it's actually like the the real like

319
00:17:22,740 --> 00:17:26,820
like forbidden knowledge is when you open up a picture of like a guy who's

320
00:17:26,820 --> 00:17:30,340
inflated his nipples so they look like toadstools and you're like oh my god I

321

can never go back to normal life again. It'll haunt you forever. I feel this huge hole in my in my life and I

322
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:43,620

00:17:43,620 --> 00:17:47,360
with like, sticking like tri-tip in my ass or something.

324

it's like they put latex around like a bed

330
00:17:58,740 --> 00:18:02,420

00:19:32,980 --> 00:19:35,460
- Nuh-uh, it's gotta be.

354
00:19:35,460 --> 00:19:36,660
- Why are you so mad?

355
00:19:36,660 --> 00:19:37,540
Yeah, it is.

356
00:19:37,540 --> 00:19:38,900
- 'Cause I'm confused!

357
00:19:38,900 --> 00:19:40,980
- That is, look, you can see the like,

358
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:43,300
you can see that's his foreskin.

359
00:19:43,300 --> 00:19:46,840
- Oh my God, dude, I can't look at this video any longer.

360
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:49,340
- It looks like a bullfrog, no!

361
00:19:49,340 --> 00:19:50,860
- Yeah, it is a bullfrog.

362
00:19:50,860 --> 00:19:52,220
- It's not a bullfrog.

363
00:19:52,220 --> 00:19:55,700
- He thinks he's in danger, and his balls, they grow,

364
00:19:55,700 --> 00:19:56,540
they grow like--

365
00:19:56,540 --> 00:20:00,660
- He's like the fucking, the dinosaur from Jurassic Park.

366
00:20:00,660 --> 00:20:01,700
You kidding?

367
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:04,900
- I just clicked on another guy, Size Fetish Dungeon.

368
00:20:04,900 --> 00:20:05,740
- Okay.

369
00:20:05,740 --> 00:20:08,340
- Pin tweet, a little gym tug and a video of him

370
00:20:08,340 --> 00:20:11,420
in a gym locker room jacking off with huge balls.

371
00:20:11,420 --> 00:20:14,660
- Imagine lifting with your balls that big?

372
00:20:14,660 --> 00:20:17,740
- I will say, it looks a lot like my gym's locker room.

373
00:20:17,740 --> 00:20:18,580
- Really?

374
00:20:18,580 --> 00:20:19,420
- Yeah, it actually does.

375
00:20:19,420 --> 00:20:20,300
- That might be you, dude.

376
00:20:20,300 --> 00:20:22,020
You might be living a double life.

377
00:20:22,020 --> 00:20:23,860
- I might have a split personality.

378
00:20:23,860 --> 00:20:25,740
- His balls aren't that big.

379
00:20:25,740 --> 00:20:26,580
- His balls aren't that big.

380
00:20:26,580 --> 00:20:27,900
- Imagine if you had a split personality

381
00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:30,260
in the way you found out as you woke up one morning

382
00:20:30,260 --> 00:20:34,260
your balls were seven times their normal size.

383
00:20:34,260 --> 00:20:39,260
Yeah, you go to the doctor and he's like, "Well, it appears you did this on purpose.

384
00:20:39,260 --> 00:20:41,260
Your balls are full of silicone."

385
00:20:41,260 --> 00:20:43,260
Your balls are extremely huge.

386
00:20:43,260 --> 00:20:47,260
And you have two, you gave the nurse two forms of identification.

387
00:20:47,260 --> 00:20:54,260
Yeah, one of them says John Smith and one says BK Bulge.

388
00:20:54,260 --> 00:21:00,340
Yeah, we just want to know how you got this state ID that says "Burger King Bowl" on it.

389
00:21:00,340 --> 00:21:03,420
I like any fetish that you can't, you physically can't hide.

390
00:21:03,420 --> 00:21:06,820
Because that guy walks around with huge balls in his pants all the time.

391
00:21:06,820 --> 00:21:08,940
Great sweatpants challenge.

392
00:21:08,940 --> 00:21:11,380
Can you imagine his great sweatpants challenge, dude?

393
00:21:11,380 --> 00:21:14,500
I'm imagining right now, and I'm gonna have to hang up the phone.

394
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:17,380
Just a complete, just a balloon, just...

395
00:21:17,380 --> 00:21:18,200
Mm-hmm.

396
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:19,100
Just poppin'.

397
00:21:19,100 --> 00:21:19,380
Yeah.

398
00:21:19,380 --> 00:21:22,060
I would just love to bring a needle to his balls.

399
00:21:22,060 --> 00:21:22,700
Yeah.

400
00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:22,980
Just...

401
00:21:22,980 --> 00:21:23,220
Yeah.

402
00:21:23,220 --> 00:21:26,340
and put more silicone in it.

403
00:21:26,340 --> 00:21:31,060
You think he has to be careful of hitting his balls on the corner of a cabinet?

404
00:21:31,060 --> 00:21:34,740
Imagine sitting on a fucking plane!

405
00:21:34,740 --> 00:21:38,140
I don't think this guy's going anywhere anytime soon.

406
00:21:38,140 --> 00:21:41,940
No, he goes to...

407
00:21:41,940 --> 00:21:46,980
He goes to the convention.

408
00:21:46,980 --> 00:21:51,740
He has to go to the Pleasuremen's Ball.

409
00:21:51,740 --> 00:21:56,660
fit my humongous balls in this yeah I'm gonna need you know the car that you

410
00:21:56,660 --> 00:22:01,180
made for Shaquille O'Neal the special made car for his height do that in the

411
00:22:01,180 --> 00:22:06,140
seat for my balls this guy is a new wrinkle in the in the pleasure men's lore

412
00:22:06,140 --> 00:22:10,540
which is funny because he doesn't have a single wrinkle in his pleasure men's ball

413
00:22:10,540 --> 00:22:15,780
if you know what I'm talking about get it get him yeah that's right I'm making fun

414
00:22:15,780 --> 00:22:22,780
of him right now I'm really better you better take down BK balls. This guy's nut sack is so smooth and giant.

415
00:22:22,780 --> 00:22:33,500
This man's nut sack is so damn smooth. This guy's balls are so big. How big are they? They're so big they got their own area code.

416
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:43,300
Yeah man those are some big-ass balls. Crazy dude. Insane. It's crazy how many new

417
00:22:43,300 --> 00:22:48,460
fetishes I've been introduced to because of Patrick yeah yeah oh speaking of

418
00:22:48,460 --> 00:22:52,780
fetishes diaper talk 3 coming soon oh yeah I did all the prep for it

419
00:22:52,780 --> 00:22:58,700
business where it's just it's so weird to have a thing yeah dude thanks I mean

420
00:22:58,700 --> 00:23:02,380
I do think those people probably on the whole are happier in life because they

421
00:23:02,380 --> 00:23:06,220
figured out something just like can say I'm locked a weird thing in their mind

422
00:23:06,220 --> 00:23:11,580
yeah and they're doing it I respect it they want to they want to come yeah

423
00:23:11,580 --> 00:23:16,860
every second of the fucking day. Imagine doing that much work to jack off that people don't use.

424
00:23:16,860 --> 00:23:20,540
That's exactly right. Yeah. Just fucking imagine doing like,

425
00:23:20,540 --> 00:23:25,820
like building a fucking lego set just so you can come. I mean I guess you get to,

426
00:23:25,820 --> 00:23:33,580
you kind of get to fuck your balls a little. I've unlocked a new area. Oh my god, I can't

427
00:23:33,580 --> 00:23:34,920
- Fuck my balls.

428
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:39,380
- Human beings only use 20% of their balls.

429
00:23:39,380 --> 00:23:40,520
(laughing)

430
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:42,920
Imagine if they could use 80%.

431
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:44,500
- Yeah, that's true.

432
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:45,340
- Yeah.

433
00:23:45,340 --> 00:23:47,720
- But I don't know, man.

434
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:49,260
I think those are the people who,

435
00:23:49,260 --> 00:23:51,680
if they don't have a hobby or

436
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:56,020
something they really care about getting better at.

437
00:23:56,020 --> 00:23:57,580
- Well, they're getting better at their balls.

438
00:23:57,580 --> 00:23:58,420
- That's what I mean.

439
00:23:58,420 --> 00:24:01,100
They can work just a normal nine to five job,

440
00:24:01,100 --> 00:24:03,300
and instead of doing woodworking,

441
00:24:03,300 --> 00:24:08,180
can just go home and fuck yeah do you think it's probably the same it's

442
00:24:08,180 --> 00:24:12,740
probably the same amount of like accomplishment you get when you fucking

443
00:24:12,740 --> 00:24:18,300
to build a shelf it's probably the same as stand-up on yeah yeah it's probably

444
00:24:18,300 --> 00:24:22,900
the exact same feeling yeah yeah it probably feels there's something there's

445
00:24:22,900 --> 00:24:31,900
some nice where it's just really bad I'm thinking of giant balls you have you

446
00:24:31,900 --> 00:24:33,300
- What do you think of quitting stand up?

447
00:24:33,300 --> 00:24:34,400
- A newbie, huh?

448
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:37,700
No, no, but I mean, I wonder if they think ever.

449
00:24:37,700 --> 00:24:39,900
- Oh yeah, yeah, the same feeling I get.

450
00:24:39,900 --> 00:24:42,100
- Oh, I just gotta make it to 10 years then,

451
00:24:42,100 --> 00:24:43,700
and then I'll get an agent.

452
00:24:43,700 --> 00:24:44,860
- Yeah.

453
00:24:44,860 --> 00:24:46,860
- For having the biggest balls in the world.

454
00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:48,220
- A big balls agent.

455
00:24:48,220 --> 00:24:49,940
- Kid, I think you got it.

456
00:24:49,940 --> 00:24:52,300
Kid, I represent people with huge balls,

457
00:24:52,300 --> 00:24:53,140
and I think you have 'em.

458
00:24:53,140 --> 00:24:54,940
- You have some of the biggest balls I've ever seen.

459
00:24:54,940 --> 00:24:58,940
- You have the world's biggest balls.

460
00:24:58,940 --> 00:25:00,460
- Kid, you brought the room down

461
00:25:00,460 --> 00:25:03,540
when you ran into the wall with your giant ball sack,

462
00:25:03,540 --> 00:25:07,300
you bounced off the wall and into the deep fryer.

463
00:25:07,300 --> 00:25:09,420
- I did, do you remember,

464
00:25:09,420 --> 00:25:11,220
did you guys ever watch videos of people

465
00:25:11,220 --> 00:25:13,480
with elephantitis of the ball sack?

466
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:14,320
- No. - No.

467
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:15,940
- I think so.

468
00:25:15,940 --> 00:25:17,620
- They like hang to the ground

469
00:25:17,620 --> 00:25:19,340
and they just bounce around on them.

470
00:25:19,340 --> 00:25:22,840
- Yeah, there's a guy who had like, no.

471
00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:25,980
I'm thinking of my 600 pound life,

472
00:25:25,980 --> 00:25:28,460
but I thought it was called my 600 pound balls.

473
00:25:28,460 --> 00:25:30,720
(laughter)

474
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:33,420
- My 600 pound balls.

475
00:25:33,420 --> 00:25:36,740
- Oh my god.

476
00:25:36,740 --> 00:25:40,080
- Coming soon to TLC, my 600 pound balls.

477
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:42,200
- We've talked about this before,

478
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:44,620
but when you are 600 pounds,

479
00:25:44,620 --> 00:25:46,620
they'll show your balls on TV.

480
00:25:46,620 --> 00:25:48,840
They won't blur them because nobody can tell what's what.

481
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:49,680
- Yeah, yeah.

482
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:51,680
Oh, he has another foot.

483
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:53,180
- Yeah, exactly.

484
00:25:53,180 --> 00:25:54,520
- Those people are gonna get mad at me again.

485
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:56,020
- Oh, look at this guy's tail.

486
00:25:56,020 --> 00:25:58,900
Yeah, that's the person who's mad at you about Bojack Horseman.

487
00:25:58,900 --> 00:25:59,900
Yeah.

488
00:25:59,900 --> 00:26:03,300
Is the 800 pound person who has to be lifted up by a crane.

489
00:26:03,300 --> 00:26:04,300
Yeah.

490
00:26:04,300 --> 00:26:05,300
Yeah.

491
00:26:05,300 --> 00:26:08,260
Just slowly just destroying the foundation of their house, the concrete.

492
00:26:08,260 --> 00:26:12,280
Something that's so beautiful about the show, My 600 Pound Balls, is it just depicts what

493
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:17,700
it's like to live life with 600 pound balls and there's no like kind of crude jokes or

494
00:26:17,700 --> 00:26:19,460
rude comments made in the show.

495
00:26:19,460 --> 00:26:20,460
It's just an honest depiction.

496
00:26:20,460 --> 00:26:21,660
And people just watch the support.

497
00:26:21,660 --> 00:26:22,660
I heard the joke.

498
00:26:22,660 --> 00:26:24,860
And I think it's honestly, I think it's hilarious.

499
00:26:24,860 --> 00:26:25,860
I heard that.

500
00:26:25,860 --> 00:26:26,860
And then a...

501
00:26:26,860 --> 00:26:27,860
Yeah, no, that's what you should have said.

502
00:26:27,860 --> 00:26:34,780
And then a, yeah, and then a, like a screen, a Tumblr screencap of like a guy saying like,

503
00:26:34,780 --> 00:26:38,780
you know, my balls are so big they have their own gravitational pull.

504
00:26:38,780 --> 00:26:42,340
And that's why sometimes I feel like the world revolves around me.

505
00:26:42,340 --> 00:26:45,780
And it's like, this is so real to my life.

506
00:26:45,780 --> 00:26:46,780
Damn.

507
00:26:46,780 --> 00:26:49,140
That is what you should have said about the BoJack Horseman thing.

508
00:26:49,140 --> 00:26:50,460
Just like, yeah, you're right.

509
00:26:50,460 --> 00:26:53,100
It did get a lot funnier when they had a fat guy on there.

510
00:26:53,100 --> 00:26:54,100
You're right.

511
00:26:54,100 --> 00:26:57,380
You're right, that was really funny. Started falling over all the time.

512
00:26:57,380 --> 00:27:04,500
No, it's just like, I read that they did that because Alison Brie was getting ripped for Glow.

513
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:09,300
That's what somebody said. She got ripped for Glow? She got ripped in half?

514
00:27:09,300 --> 00:27:13,140
Yeah. Why? She got ripped for Glow.

515
00:27:13,140 --> 00:27:17,140
Mark Maron ripped her in half. Oh, you mean she got in shape.

516
00:27:17,140 --> 00:27:19,060
Yeah. Okay. No, she got like ripped.

517
00:27:19,060 --> 00:27:23,940
She got ripped in half. No, she got ripped. I read it in the replies of it.

518
00:27:23,940 --> 00:27:28,700
and they made they made her fat in the cartoon to make up for the fact that she

519
00:27:28,700 --> 00:27:32,580
was ripped in real life and also her character was Asian so I don't know what

520
00:27:32,580 --> 00:27:35,980
they did oh yeah she was the one who had the the Asian character and she wasn't

521
00:27:35,980 --> 00:27:40,540
Asian everyone got mad yeah yeah and then they had to do like a whole episode

522
00:27:40,540 --> 00:27:44,860
that was like the background of the Asian character so that she's not just

523
00:27:44,860 --> 00:27:51,660
normal Asian she's from Boston - yeah she's she's special Asian yeah yeah

524
00:27:51,660 --> 00:27:56,200
that's right secret Asian secret Asian you remember that shit remember that

525
00:27:56,200 --> 00:28:02,700
should be the greatest oh my god dude the LimeWire parody no saying that who's

526
00:28:02,700 --> 00:28:08,100
saying that question mark question song by da Vinci's notebook oh yeah that's

527
00:28:08,100 --> 00:28:15,180
that they're like acapella band yeah yeah we should maybe do an acapella thing

528
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:23,500
I was going low, you have to go really high. I have the lowest voice. Yeah, right. I do.

529
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:33,300
Yeah, you don't have the lowest voice. My voice is definitely lower than Cameron's. Put that

530
00:28:33,300 --> 00:28:39,700
away. That was my voice. Put that bass away. You do not have a bass voice, you have a baritone

531
00:28:39,700 --> 00:28:43,380
at best. You have the highest pitched voice in the world. I have a beautiful baritone.

532
00:28:43,380 --> 00:28:45,380
You sound like Alvin and his chipmunks to me.

533
00:28:45,380 --> 00:28:47,380
I sound like Ian Curtis.

534
00:28:47,380 --> 00:28:49,380
I don't know who that is.

535
00:28:49,380 --> 00:28:51,380
It's a guy from Joy Division.

536
00:28:51,380 --> 00:28:53,380
It's the second time you talked about Joy Division today.

537
00:28:53,380 --> 00:28:55,380
Getting a bass has ruined you.

538
00:28:55,380 --> 00:28:57,380
You're my least favorite friend now.

539
00:28:57,380 --> 00:28:59,380
You might turn into a rock guy now.

540
00:28:59,380 --> 00:29:01,380
You just keep talking about music all the time.

541
00:29:01,380 --> 00:29:03,380
You get on the call and you're like, "Oh, hold up guys.

542
00:29:03,380 --> 00:29:05,380
Before we record, is the recorder set to a D major scale?"

543
00:29:05,380 --> 00:29:07,380
And I'm like, Patrick, that doesn't even make any sense.

544
00:29:07,380 --> 00:29:09,380
What are you talking about?

545
00:29:09,380 --> 00:29:11,380
You're gonna be one of these guys.

546
00:29:11,380 --> 00:29:13,380
I'm gonna get a job at Guitar Center.

547
00:29:13,380 --> 00:29:16,380
Hold on, I need to syncopate my voice this episode.

548
00:29:16,380 --> 00:29:18,380
I'm like, "Patrick, what are you talking about?"

549
00:29:18,380 --> 00:29:20,380
I ain't syncopating shit.

550
00:29:20,380 --> 00:29:22,380
And then he says, "Hold up, before I say this riff, let me tune myself."

551
00:29:22,380 --> 00:29:24,380

You can go hang out with your friends.

Your feet are beautiful to you?

00:43:32,760 --> 00:43:33,760
Maybe that's the thing you're unlucky.

779
00:43:33,760 --> 00:43:34,760
Your own feet.

780
00:43:34,760 --> 00:43:40,120
feet yeah I think I have touched my hard penis with my foot before really

781
00:43:40,120 --> 00:43:44,680
interesting thing is I really am serious I want to have a weird fetish but I

782
00:43:44,680 --> 00:43:47,920
can't find one if anybody could recommend me something just force

783
00:43:47,920 --> 00:43:54,880
yourself into one yeah you can force yourself into peepee just get into just

784
00:43:54,880 --> 00:43:58,280
it's like no dude it's like getting into like Captain Beefheart you just have to

785
00:43:58,280 --> 00:44:01,320
You gotta do it a few times before it clicks, you know?

786
00:44:01,320 --> 00:44:02,820
Yeah, that's a really good point.

787
00:44:02,820 --> 00:44:03,820
That really got me.

788
00:44:03,820 --> 00:44:07,400
Yeah, nobody wants to do it the first time and be like, "Oh, this rocks."

789
00:44:07,400 --> 00:44:09,320
As a rocker, that really got me, Cameron.

790
00:44:09,320 --> 00:44:13,120
Just getting pissed on by a prostitute being like, "Well, I don't like this now, but maybe..."

791
00:44:13,120 --> 00:44:16,140
You know, it's not enjoyable, but it's something about the way it's constructed that really

792
00:44:16,140 --> 00:44:17,140
makes it fascinating.

793
00:44:17,140 --> 00:44:23,240
It's kind of like a subversion of what an enjoyable activity would be, which is kind

794
00:44:23,240 --> 00:44:25,700
of what makes it interesting as an experience.

795
00:44:25,700 --> 00:44:27,640
Can you just give me like a "Safe as Milk" pee?

796
00:44:27,640 --> 00:44:31,420
I don't think I'm ready for a trout mask replica P. Shut up dude

Patrick's favorites Captain B fart song is Dachau blues, but he smiles really wide whenever he listens to it

799
00:44:45,160 --> 00:44:50,660
It's a good son. He only listens to he reads the lyrics over and over you just come and he says I love what happens in

800
00:44:50,660 --> 00:44:55,220
This song you're literally becoming Marin. You're starting a podcast with a riff

801
00:44:55,220 --> 00:44:57,220
What the fuck is wrong with you, bro?

802
00:44:57,220 --> 00:44:59,220
Are you talking about Captain Beefheart?

803
00:44:59,220 --> 00:45:03,220
My dad got bit by Mark Maron in the 80s.

804
00:45:03,220 --> 00:45:05,220
Didn't you work with him?

805
00:45:05,220 --> 00:45:07,220
Yeah, I know. He got bit by him.

806
00:45:07,220 --> 00:45:09,220
And it skips a generation.

807
00:45:09,220 --> 00:45:11,220
And you know what?

808
00:45:11,220 --> 00:45:13,220
I'm like a balding wolf man.

809
00:45:13,220 --> 00:45:15,220
It skips a generation.

810
00:45:15,220 --> 00:45:17,220
And that's why I'm turning into Mark Maron.

811
00:45:17,220 --> 00:45:19,220
You're getting marked up.

812
00:45:19,220 --> 00:45:21,220
You're more like Pork Maron.

813
00:45:21,220 --> 00:45:23,220
Hey, man.

814
00:45:23,220 --> 00:45:27,340

Yeah, you're more like shark Marin fuck you dude I hate you yeah, nobody called me sparse heron

816
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:45,140
Nobody say that I said it first and no one else can say it. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah. Hey, that's pretty good

817
00:45:45,140 --> 00:45:50,140
I think the fans will love my newfound love of rock and roll. Nobody likes rock except you anymore, dude

818
00:45:50,140 --> 00:45:54,420
Literally people have moved on. Yeah. It's all about role. It's about the role now. People don't like the rock anymore.

819
00:45:54,420 --> 00:45:58,060
I think a few YouTube comments will disagree with you. Yeah.

820
00:45:58,060 --> 00:46:05,700
Mm-hmm. From unsuspecting people. Mm-hmm. Yeah, I'm a clown at the circus and I actually really like this song.

821
00:46:05,700 --> 00:46:07,500
Yeah.

822
00:46:07,500 --> 00:46:09,500
Yeah. Impressive, right?

823
00:46:09,500 --> 00:46:12,220
Just say it. I know you wanna say it. Yeah, yeah.

824
00:46:12,220 --> 00:46:18,580
We're just talking about like going on like Aerosmith songs and just seeing YouTube comments that are like

825
00:46:18,580 --> 00:46:25,580
I'm the blackest guy alive and even I love this song. It's so it's so funny to see that.

826
00:46:25,580 --> 00:46:32,200
I'm a black guy in the hood and I love this song. Yeah there's comments on like

827
00:46:32,200 --> 00:46:40,440
happy birthday that are like I'm a famous black guy and I love this song. Yeah I'm

828
00:46:40,440 --> 00:46:46,840
actually Tupac and I think this is the best song ever. I saw Christian posted something

829
00:46:46,840 --> 00:46:52,240
or forever ago but he said it to me the other day that was like a it's like a

830
00:46:52,240 --> 00:46:55,480
YouTube comment that was like this is the only song this song reminds me of my

831
00:46:55,480 --> 00:47:00,320
brother like this was his the last song before he died and then the next comment was from

832
00:47:00,320 --> 00:47:10,040
Adolf Hitler and it was this is the best song ever. It rocks. Yeah it's so good I do love those people who make

833
00:47:10,040 --> 00:47:15,160
YouTube channels that called like yeah like fucking Che Guevara and they just

834
00:47:15,160 --> 00:47:20,560
comments on Minecraft videos yeah how do I get good at redstone?

835
00:47:20,560 --> 00:47:24,800
J Guevara. Right, because it's like comments from like six years ago and it's like Peter

836
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:34,080
Griffin and it's like he will not divide us. Yeah yeah the Noid love Trump's hate.

837
00:47:34,080 --> 00:47:41,800
Oh damn they they breaking out the fleshlight freaks this season. Is that so?

838
00:47:41,800 --> 00:47:47,120
Oh what does that mean? What are you even talking about? Alien fleshlight, Dracula fleshlight,

839
00:47:47,120 --> 00:47:52,320
Predator fleshlight, Redditor? Every fleshlight's a Predator fleshlight. Did you say Redditor?

840
00:47:52,320 --> 00:47:57,200
Redditor. Predator fleshlight. Dude, Alien vs. the Redditor dude. Imagine what that looks

841
00:47:57,200 --> 00:48:02,600
like. Yeah, probably not very fun. Oh hey, when you think about it, the Reddit logo is

842
00:48:02,600 --> 00:48:09,600
an alien. That's true. NOOOO! Oh, this is a fleshlight with two pussies. Damn! So you

843
00:48:10,120 --> 00:48:15,520
That's Dr. Jekyll and Mrs. Hyde.

844
00:48:15,520 --> 00:48:19,240
Yo this fleshlight fucked the whole squad dude.

845
00:48:19,240 --> 00:48:20,240
That's right.

846
00:48:20,240 --> 00:48:21,240
I'll pass it to the left.

847
00:48:21,240 --> 00:48:22,240
Yeah.

848
00:48:22,240 --> 00:48:23,240
This fleshlight belongs to the cyborg fleshlight.

849
00:48:23,240 --> 00:48:24,240
Maybe that's my thing.

850
00:48:24,240 --> 00:48:25,240
Maybe I want to share a fleshlight.

851
00:48:25,240 --> 00:48:26,240
Yeah?

852
00:48:26,240 --> 00:48:27,240
Yeah?

853
00:48:27,240 --> 00:48:28,240
No.

854
00:48:28,240 --> 00:48:29,240
No.

855
00:48:29,240 --> 00:48:34,140
No, it's just because you love communism so much that you want to share your fleshlight

856
00:48:34,140 --> 00:48:35,140
with your homies.

857
00:48:35,140 --> 00:48:38,320
Yeah, hey, seize the means of reproduction, am I right?

858
00:48:38,320 --> 00:48:39,320
Whoa!

859
00:48:39,320 --> 00:48:41,120
All right, I think we just made the best episode ever.

860
00:48:41,120 --> 00:48:42,360
Cameron coming in with heaters.

861
00:48:42,360 --> 00:48:44,400
I think we just hit the, I just think we just hit it.

862
00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:46,240
I think we were getting close and then you said that,

863
00:48:46,240 --> 00:48:47,400
might have put us over the top.

864
00:48:47,400 --> 00:48:49,520
Might be at number one right now.

865
00:48:49,520 --> 00:48:50,440
God damn.

866
00:48:50,440 --> 00:48:51,280
Defcon one.

867
00:48:51,280 --> 00:48:52,120
God damn, God damn.

868
00:48:52,120 --> 00:48:54,840
God damn, God damn.

869
00:48:54,840 --> 00:48:57,040
Do I love this song?

870
00:48:57,040 --> 00:48:57,880
I found my copy.

871
00:48:57,880 --> 00:49:00,600
Oh my God, you found the Communist Manifesto?

872
00:49:00,600 --> 00:49:04,800
I got a copy of Capital right there off camera.

873
00:49:04,800 --> 00:49:06,600
Nice, I have a copy of--

874
00:49:06,600 --> 00:49:08,640
You know, I didn't realize it was this thin too.

875
00:49:08,640 --> 00:49:11,640
I have a copy of the rap yearbook by Shea Serrano.

876
00:49:11,640 --> 00:49:12,640
Oh damn.

877
00:49:12,640 --> 00:49:13,640
It's kind of the same thing.

878
00:49:13,640 --> 00:49:14,640
Damn.

879
00:49:14,640 --> 00:49:19,640
I got How to Develop and Use Psychometry by Ted Andrews.

880
00:49:19,640 --> 00:49:22,640
If anyone wants to learn psychic powers.

881
00:49:22,640 --> 00:49:23,640
Nice.

882
00:49:23,640 --> 00:49:24,640
I could do that.

883
00:49:24,640 --> 00:49:25,640
Very cool.

884
00:49:25,640 --> 00:49:28,720
Do you have a book on how to protect yourself from psychic attacks?

885
00:49:28,720 --> 00:49:30,240
I've been getting attacked lately.

886
00:49:30,240 --> 00:49:31,240
Yeah.

887
00:49:31,240 --> 00:49:32,240
I am getting attacked.

888
00:49:32,240 --> 00:49:33,240
I actually am.

889
00:49:33,240 --> 00:49:35,440
You've been getting attacked by rats, not psychically like me.

890
00:49:35,440 --> 00:49:36,440
They're mice.

891
00:49:36,440 --> 00:49:43,480
I was listening to this podcast that was, I forgot about this period in my life, but I

892
00:49:43,480 --> 00:49:46,600
was really obsessed with learning about like psychic attack and stuff.

893
00:49:46,600 --> 00:49:52,300
I was listening to this podcast that was meant to like develop your mind, your like psychic

894
00:49:52,300 --> 00:49:53,300
powers or whatever.

895
00:49:53,300 --> 00:49:58,380
And it was just, it would just be like a woman talking for like an hour.

896
00:49:58,380 --> 00:50:04,960
And I think it's the closest thing that I've ever, that I've ever come to like being actually

897
00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:11,680
brainwashed. I would just sit there and play Binding of Isaac and it would just be like

898
00:50:11,680 --> 00:50:16,240
this woman's voice talking over a drone that would just be like, "There are

899
00:50:16,240 --> 00:50:23,080
structures on the moon. You need to defend yourself." I would

900
00:50:23,080 --> 00:50:25,680
start listening to it and then it would just be over and I wouldn't remember

901
00:50:25,680 --> 00:50:31,840
anything that she said and I'd be like, "Oh, this is very bad." Yeah. Did you find that in Ascension

902
00:50:31,840 --> 00:50:32,680
- Desmian Fifth Dimension?

903
00:50:32,680 --> 00:50:34,200
- No, I found it on a--

904
00:50:34,200 --> 00:50:35,640
- Oh, remember that shit, dude?

905
00:50:35,640 --> 00:50:36,880
- Yeah, that's like-- - That Facebook group?

906
00:50:36,880 --> 00:50:37,800
- Yeah. - I'm still in that.

907
00:50:37,800 --> 00:50:38,960
- That's a great Facebook group.

908
00:50:38,960 --> 00:50:41,120
- What was our guy who we thought killed himself?

909
00:50:41,120 --> 00:50:42,400
- Desmian Blu-ray. - Desmian Blu-ray.

910
00:50:42,400 --> 00:50:43,240
- Yeah. - Oh, yeah.

911
00:50:43,240 --> 00:50:45,080
- Everybody check out Desmian Blu-ray.

912
00:50:45,080 --> 00:50:47,120
That's a really good Facebook friend.

913
00:50:47,120 --> 00:50:49,200
- I'm gonna check right now if he's been posting anything.

914
00:50:49,200 --> 00:50:52,660
- Remember, I stopped posting or reading anything in there

915
00:50:52,660 --> 00:50:56,360
because that woman sent me that Facebook message.

916
00:50:56,360 --> 00:50:57,320
- I don't remember that. - Remember that?

917
00:50:57,320 --> 00:50:58,160
- I don't remember that. - The one,

918
00:50:58,160 --> 00:50:59,720
it was a woman, a woman called me

919
00:50:59,720 --> 00:51:01,720
asked me to protect her she left me a

920
00:51:01,720 --> 00:51:03,720
face with horsemen. Oh yeah like an older lady?

921
00:51:03,720 --> 00:51:05,720
Yeah yeah it was like an old lady called me

922
00:51:05,720 --> 00:51:07,720
because I had my profile

923
00:51:07,720 --> 00:51:09,720
picture was me holding like it was a photoshop

924
00:51:09,720 --> 00:51:11,720
of me holding a buster sword and

925
00:51:11,720 --> 00:51:13,720
she was like I need you to protect me

926
00:51:13,720 --> 00:51:15,720
I need you to

927
00:51:15,720 --> 00:51:17,720
protect me

928
00:51:17,720 --> 00:51:19,720
we're gonna fight the demons

929
00:51:19,720 --> 00:51:21,720
I was like I can't

930
00:51:21,720 --> 00:51:23,720
I can't be a minister. Did you protect her?

931
00:51:23,720 --> 00:51:25,720
I failed

932
00:51:25,720 --> 00:51:27,720
to protect her. She was killed by a demon

933
00:51:27,720 --> 00:51:33,560
From the Ascension Facebook groups I moved on into all the targeted individual and gang stalking groups.

934
00:51:33,560 --> 00:51:37,560
And those ones are genuinely depressing. They're so fucked up dude.

935
00:51:37,560 --> 00:51:41,960
There are people who will just post videos of their houses and shit and be like

936
00:51:41,960 --> 00:51:48,920
"I am being attacked by microwave rays that are making me think about how I am in love with boys."

937
00:51:48,920 --> 00:51:51,760
And shit like that.

938
00:51:51,760 --> 00:51:56,080
But then you'll also see people will go in there and post little infographics that are like

939
00:51:56,080 --> 00:52:00,040
it's perfectly legal to kill somebody or harm them if you think they are

940
00:52:00,040 --> 00:52:05,160
gang stalking you. Oh yeah I did see that. Yeah and it's just like just trying to get people to do mass shootings it's so

941
00:52:05,160 --> 00:52:10,160
fucked up dude. Yeah. Yeah. I'm looking through my my Facebook groups. We should

942
00:52:10,160 --> 00:52:16,020
start gang stalking someone. We should. We should be the first podcast to actually be

943
00:52:16,020 --> 00:52:23,000
sending someone secret messages. Yeah. Yeah. We honestly should. Derek. Yeah. Yeah. We

944
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:24,540
We already said that bit before.

945
00:52:24,540 --> 00:52:26,660
We did that bit before with I think the name,

946
00:52:26,660 --> 00:52:29,540
we said like, Michael, if you're driving a car right now,

947
00:52:29,540 --> 00:52:31,500
and then somebody after that episode came out,

948
00:52:31,500 --> 00:52:32,500
somebody messaged me and said,

949
00:52:32,500 --> 00:52:34,500
my name is Michael and I was driving a car,

950
00:52:34,500 --> 00:52:35,940
and you really freaked me out.

951
00:52:35,940 --> 00:52:38,220
- We should, you should have just not responded,

952
00:52:38,220 --> 00:52:39,460
we just kept going with it.

953
00:52:39,460 --> 00:52:41,420
- I did not respond to that, and we're still going with it.

954
00:52:41,420 --> 00:52:43,820
- Michael, wherever you are right now,

955
00:52:43,820 --> 00:52:47,100
just fucking kiss, just kiss your hand.

956
00:52:47,100 --> 00:52:48,580
Start fucking making out with your hand.

957
00:52:48,580 --> 00:52:50,820
- Get a kiss from me. - Send us some photos.

958
00:52:52,020 --> 00:52:55,340
yeah it's me behind the bearded barley

959
00:52:55,340 --> 00:52:58,860
lightly again with the rock oh my god

00:52:58,860 --> 00:53:00,980

00:53:16,980 --> 00:53:19,300
we were listening to the like the

968
00:53:19,300 --> 00:53:23,900
classic rock station in your car on the way back from New York and it's just like

969
00:53:23,900 --> 00:53:29,580
it's so fucking funny to me that people heard that stuff and where it was like

970
00:53:29,580 --> 00:53:34,900
oh this is the devil yeah yeah a song that's like jump around let's have fun

971
00:53:34,900 --> 00:53:40,700
let's all party until the Sun and then the parents are like oh my god it's a

972
00:53:40,700 --> 00:53:46,180
crazy yeah that's like that's like hearing like run DMC now and like just

973
00:53:46,180 --> 00:53:49,860
the fucking moral panic that like parent like fucking Tipper Gore had in the 80s

974
00:53:49,860 --> 00:53:53,060
yeah it's like this is gonna lead kids into gang violence

975
00:53:53,060 --> 00:53:54,180
I can't wait till we-

976
00:53:54,180 --> 00:53:58,180
and then all the sons are like "MY ADIDAS ARE COOL AND THEY DON'T WEAR THEIR LACES IN THEM"

977
00:53:58,180 --> 00:54:02,580
well that's the next phase of it is parents are all gonna think that their their children are

978
00:54:02,580 --> 00:54:05,140
turning trans because they're listening to a hundred gecks

979
00:54:05,140 --> 00:54:07,540
exactly yeah it's so fucking weird

980
00:54:07,540 --> 00:54:11,940
I can't wait till we are old enough that we are like so out of touch and have like

981
00:54:11,940 --> 00:54:15,540
because I think people even if they don't agree with shit like that

982
00:54:16,100 --> 00:54:20,180
they have that something is pulling them to yeah there's always there is a

983
00:54:20,180 --> 00:54:23,420
little better nobody has ever thought it was going to happen to them and then it

984
00:54:23,420 --> 00:54:26,660
was i cannot wait for like twenty years when something comes out where i'm just

985
00:54:26,660 --> 00:54:31,100

Everybody's fucking their car.

Come on, Dad.

996
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:51,840
It's cool.

997
00:54:51,840 --> 00:54:53,340
It's cool to fuck my car.

998
00:54:53,340 --> 00:54:54,740
- Let me fuck the Miata, Dad.

999
00:54:54,740 --> 00:54:57,880
- I'm not sure about all this fucking your car business.

1000
00:54:57,880 --> 00:54:59,060
Nah, man, it's cool.

1001
00:54:59,060 --> 00:54:59,900
They put an extra hole.

1002
00:54:59,900 --> 00:55:00,940
- Everyone's doing it.

1003
00:55:00,940 --> 00:55:02,420
- Everybody's fucking their car now.

1004
00:55:02,420 --> 00:55:05,120
- You just put a beer koozie in the exhaust pipe, Dad.

1005
00:55:05,120 --> 00:55:05,960
Come on.

1006
00:55:05,960 --> 00:55:06,780
- That's right.

1007
00:55:06,780 --> 00:55:07,620
- Come on.

1008
00:55:07,620 --> 00:55:08,460
- Maybe that's Caleb's thing.

1009
00:55:08,460 --> 00:55:09,520
- And if you want a really fun time,

1010
00:55:09,520 --> 00:55:11,180
you leave the car running.

1011
00:55:11,180 --> 00:55:15,440
Do you think people buy like, are there certain cars

1012
00:55:15,440 --> 00:55:17,100
that are female?

1013
00:55:17,100 --> 00:55:18,700
Yeah, whatever year's in.

1014
00:55:18,700 --> 00:55:19,540
No!

1015
00:55:19,540 --> 00:55:20,360
(laughing)

1016
00:55:20,360 --> 00:55:21,200
As their war's in.

1017
00:55:21,200 --> 00:55:22,780
Like, do you think like a Miata?

1018
00:55:22,780 --> 00:55:24,900
You think like people who drive Miatas are like--

1019
00:55:24,900 --> 00:55:27,860
Probably like a Honda, yeah, like a Honda Samantha.

1020
00:55:27,860 --> 00:55:28,700
(laughing)

1021
00:55:28,700 --> 00:55:29,540
Honda Samantha.

1022
00:55:29,540 --> 00:55:31,700
Yeah, that's probably a girl car.

1023
00:55:31,700 --> 00:55:33,300
A Mitsubishi Claire.

1024
00:55:33,300 --> 00:55:36,300
Yeah, those are all total girl, 'cause most cars do,

1025
00:55:36,300 --> 00:55:37,780
they haven't come out with a girl car yet.

1026
00:55:37,780 --> 00:55:38,600
They've always--

1027
00:55:38,600 --> 00:55:39,540
Well, that's the thing, most cars look like,

1028
00:55:39,540 --> 00:55:40,860
most cars are phallic.

1029
00:55:40,860 --> 00:55:42,500
- Most cars look like boys.

1030
00:55:42,500 --> 00:55:43,340
- Yeah.

1031
00:55:43,340 --> 00:55:44,160
- Yeah.

1032
00:55:44,160 --> 00:55:48,840
- You wanna tell me that a fucking Dodge Charger is female?

1033
00:55:48,840 --> 00:55:52,020
- Convertibles look like vaginas to me.

1034
00:55:52,020 --> 00:55:52,860
- Okay, there we go.

1035
00:55:52,860 --> 00:55:54,580
- The convertible is the foreskin.

1036
00:55:54,580 --> 00:55:55,600
It's also a male car.

1037
00:55:55,600 --> 00:56:00,600
- 'Cause all cars look like the driver has a big penis.

1038
00:56:00,600 --> 00:56:01,440
- Is that true?

1039
00:56:01,440 --> 00:56:02,280
- Uh-huh.

1040
00:56:02,280 --> 00:56:03,320
It depends on the car.

1041
00:56:03,320 --> 00:56:04,880
All muscle cars, all sports cars.

1042
00:56:04,880 --> 00:56:07,160
- It's funny that people think that people

1043
00:56:07,160 --> 00:56:08,880
with cool cars have small dicks.

1044
00:56:08,880 --> 00:56:11,040
It's like, no dude, they're rich and you're poor.

1045
00:56:11,040 --> 00:56:11,880
- Yeah.

1046
00:56:11,880 --> 00:56:12,720
- Just shut up.

1047
00:56:12,720 --> 00:56:13,560
- Come from me.

1048
00:56:13,560 --> 00:56:15,160
- Yeah, sorry you have a Honda Civic.

1049
00:56:15,160 --> 00:56:16,280
(laughing)

1050
00:56:16,280 --> 00:56:17,520
They're cool and rich.

1051
00:56:17,520 --> 00:56:20,720
- Hummers I get, like, I understand there's some people,

1052
00:56:20,720 --> 00:56:23,640
like some cars that I'm like, yeah, you know, like a Hummer.

1053
00:56:23,640 --> 00:56:25,440
- A Hummer just means that you fucking miss

1054
00:56:25,440 --> 00:56:26,800
killing people in Afghanistan.

1055
00:56:26,800 --> 00:56:27,640
- Yeah.

1056
00:56:27,640 --> 00:56:28,460
- That's why you buy a Hummer.

1057
00:56:28,460 --> 00:56:30,000
- No, but it's the people who buy Hummers

1058
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:31,480
who like want to act like that.

1059
00:56:31,480 --> 00:56:33,800
- You either miss killing people in Afghanistan

1060
00:56:33,800 --> 00:56:37,280
or you really, really wish that you could miss

1061
00:56:37,280 --> 00:56:38,120
killing people in Afghanistan.

1062
00:56:38,120 --> 00:56:42,100
because it's those guys that it's those guys that like act like uh... it like

1063
00:56:42,100 --> 00:56:44,440
they know about like security and shit

1064
00:56:44,440 --> 00:56:48,000
yeah guys who like yeah you know i've never served but by also uh... has

1065
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:52,240
scouted every exit every possible exit yeah created i always say i think that

1066
00:56:52,240 --> 00:56:55,680
they want to have that they want to get it well i'm i'm scouting the security

1067
00:56:55,680 --> 00:56:59,800
uh... uh... tactics of this location i'm seeing there is one door here with a

1068
00:56:59,800 --> 00:57:03,840
lock we also have a window that several stories off the ground and in a very

1069
00:57:03,840 --> 00:57:07,160
serious situation i could probably wriggle down the toilet hole

1070
00:57:07,160 --> 00:57:10,520
I'm gonna be in this there's a very tactical position in the women's locker

1071
00:57:10,520 --> 00:57:15,440
room I will be in a tactical position possible. Ma'am, I am putting

1072
00:57:15,440 --> 00:57:20,480
the GoPro here for surveillance. My father-in-law every time he walks into a

1073
00:57:20,480 --> 00:57:24,600
restaurant has to be sitting at a place where he's looking at the door. Yeah and

1074
00:57:24,600 --> 00:57:35,160
just in case a really sexy lady comes into the door. His eyeballs need to go out the door if they touch the wall those contacts will get all messed up.

1075
00:57:35,160 --> 00:57:36,160
That's a really good point.

1076
00:57:36,160 --> 00:57:37,160
Yeah.

1077
00:57:37,160 --> 00:57:38,160
Yeah.

1078
00:57:38,160 --> 00:57:39,160
I don't know.

1079
00:57:39,160 --> 00:57:42,880
When his eyeballs spring out of his head like that wolf in the cartoon, he's got to, they

1080
00:57:42,880 --> 00:57:45,520
got to go out the door or something or a window at least.

1081
00:57:45,520 --> 00:57:50,320
I say that but every time that I'm in a movie theater, I'm like, I could, if I needed to,

1082
00:57:50,320 --> 00:57:52,080
I could jump off of a balcony.

1083
00:57:52,080 --> 00:57:53,080
That's different.

1084
00:57:53,080 --> 00:57:54,880
Even if I break my legs, I could crawl my way out of this.

1085
00:57:54,880 --> 00:57:55,880
Yeah.

1086
00:57:55,880 --> 00:57:56,880
Yeah.

1087
00:57:56,880 --> 00:57:57,880
Yeah.

1088
00:57:57,880 --> 00:58:00,320
That's, I mean, fucking James Holmes ruined all that shit.

1089
00:58:00,320 --> 00:58:01,320
Yeah.

1090
00:58:01,320 --> 00:58:02,320
You're right.

1091
00:58:02,320 --> 00:58:03,320
Nobody's ever been shot in a restaurant, thank God.

1092
00:58:03,320 --> 00:58:04,320
No.

1093
00:58:04,320 --> 00:58:05,880
- Ask Robert Blake.

1094
00:58:05,880 --> 00:58:08,480
He didn't shoot his wife, he just left his gun there.

1095
00:58:08,480 --> 00:58:09,640
- That's right.

1096
00:58:09,640 --> 00:58:10,680
- Was that Robert Blake?

1097
00:58:10,680 --> 00:58:12,080
- I don't know who you're talking about.

1098
00:58:12,080 --> 00:58:13,760
Sometimes you say stuff with these names

1099
00:58:13,760 --> 00:58:14,960
that I don't understand and I just say,

1100
00:58:14,960 --> 00:58:16,720
yeah, yeah, no, I know what you're talking about.

1101
00:58:16,720 --> 00:58:17,800
And I just hope that you move on

1102
00:58:17,800 --> 00:58:18,640
and start talking about SpongeBob or something.

1103
00:58:18,640 --> 00:58:21,040
- Patrick knows the name of every man

1104
00:58:21,040 --> 00:58:22,640
that has ever lived on this earth,

1105
00:58:22,640 --> 00:58:25,800
but he can't figure out what three plus four is

1106
00:58:25,800 --> 00:58:27,480
in under five seconds.

1107
00:58:27,480 --> 00:58:29,000
- I'm different kind of smart.

1108
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:30,960
- I'm just stating facts, I didn't say it was good or bad.

1109
00:58:30,960 --> 00:58:32,040
- It's called street smarts, okay?

1110
00:58:32,040 --> 00:58:32,880
- Yeah.

1111
00:58:32,880 --> 00:58:34,520
- It's called being smart about men.

1112
00:58:34,520 --> 00:58:35,360
- Yeah.

1113
00:58:35,360 --> 00:58:37,360
- It's called knowing every man alive.

1114
00:58:37,360 --> 00:58:38,200
- Exactly.

1115
00:58:38,200 --> 00:58:39,020
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1116
00:58:39,020 --> 00:58:41,040
So he, Robert Blake took his wife out to dinner.

1117
00:58:41,040 --> 00:58:42,040
- Who's Robert Blake?

1118
00:58:42,040 --> 00:58:46,600
- He is the weird guy in that David Lynch movie.

1119
00:58:46,600 --> 00:58:49,880
- Oh yeah, dude, the weird guy.

1120
00:58:49,880 --> 00:58:50,720
- The weird guy in the David Lynch movie.

1121
00:58:50,720 --> 00:58:52,320
- The weird, how downright, of course,

1122
00:58:52,320 --> 00:58:53,520
the weird guy in that David Lynch movie.

1123
00:58:53,520 --> 00:58:54,720
- Lost Highway.

1124
00:58:54,720 --> 00:58:56,440
I knew it was, I knew he had the word highway.

1125
00:58:56,440 --> 00:58:57,480
- The mystery man?

1126
00:58:57,480 --> 00:58:59,320
- Yeah, he's the mystery man in Lost Highway.

1127
00:58:59,320 --> 00:59:00,640
- He killed his wife?

1128
00:59:00,640 --> 00:59:01,840
He, um...

1129
00:59:01,840 --> 00:59:04,120
That adds another layer to that scene.

1130
00:59:04,120 --> 00:59:05,380
Wow.

1131
00:59:05,380 --> 00:59:07,200
He killed his wife

1132
00:59:07,200 --> 00:59:10,300
at, uh, like after he left the restaurant.

1133
00:59:10,300 --> 00:59:11,200
Um...

1134
00:59:11,200 --> 00:59:16,840
He returned to the restaurant and was like, "Hey, I left my pistol here."

1135
00:59:16,840 --> 00:59:20,080
What? He killed his wife and then was like,

1136
00:59:20,080 --> 00:59:24,840
"Ah, crap. I left my... Hey, sorry to be a pain. I left my pistol."

1137
00:59:24,840 --> 00:59:26,720
He told his wife and then he walked into the restaurant and he went,

You like to make girl music.

1153
00:59:58,400 --> 01:00:00,320
You like to make music for girls.

1154
01:00:00,320 --> 01:00:00,820
So?

1155
01:00:00,820 --> 01:00:04,800
So what? That's all we're saying. We're not saying anything else.

1156
01:00:04,800 --> 01:00:06,640
You guys are getting mad at me again.

1157
01:00:06,640 --> 01:00:07,280
I hate you.

1158
01:00:07,280 --> 01:00:09,760
I'm going to come over to your house.

1159
01:00:09,760 --> 01:00:11,760
Let's not, don't end this on a bad note.

1160
01:00:11,760 --> 01:00:12,480
You're right. I love you so much.

1161
01:00:12,480 --> 01:00:15,520
I'm going to come over to your house and I'm going to do some nice things to you.

1162
01:00:15,520 --> 01:00:18,960
Yeah. I'm going to tickle you with a feather.

1163
01:00:18,960 --> 01:00:21,120
That's so nice.

1164
01:00:21,120 --> 01:00:23,520
No, it's not going to be nice. You're not going to like it.

1165
01:00:23,520 --> 01:00:26,880
What about like what if I got into tickling next time you guys are in New York?

1166
01:00:26,880 --> 01:00:29,440
Can you guys just tickle me all I come? Yeah, sure

1167
01:00:29,440 --> 01:00:35,840
Is there any way camera tickled me on the last episode I tickled you a few times did you like it though?

1168
01:00:35,840 --> 01:00:40,800
No, I hate being tickled because I like it. You laugh every time dude. I like you love it

1169
01:00:40,800 --> 01:00:43,280
I'm a little gig. I low-key like it

1170
01:00:43,280 --> 01:00:49,360
Joe don't say do not say i'm a little giggle bear

1171
01:00:51,520 --> 01:00:52,800
Don't say that, man.

1172
01:00:52,800 --> 01:00:55,760
He said, he said, "I'm a little giggle bear."

1173
01:00:55,760 --> 01:00:57,760
Don't fucking say that, dude.

1174
01:00:57,760 --> 01:00:58,260
I don't...

1175
01:00:58,260 --> 01:01:00,260
*laughing*

1176
01:01:00,260 --> 01:01:02,260
I can't think about this right now.

1177
01:01:02,260 --> 01:01:04,260
*laughing*

1178
01:01:04,260 --> 01:01:06,260
I have a mouse problem I have to deal with.

1179
01:01:06,260 --> 01:01:08,260
Now I'm gonna be sitting...

1180
01:01:08,260 --> 01:01:10,260
I'm gonna sit in the kitchen, I'm afraid of the mice.

1181
01:01:10,260 --> 01:01:13,260
And I'm gonna think, "Patrick is a little giggle bear."

1182
01:01:13,260 --> 01:01:15,260
What the fuck is wrong with you, dude?

1183
01:01:15,260 --> 01:01:18,260
We're trying to make money off of this show.

1184
01:01:18,260 --> 01:01:20,260
And you're saying...

1185
01:01:20,260 --> 01:01:24,660
I'm a little giggle bear. Shut up dude. Oh my god.

1186
01:01:24,660 --> 01:01:28,180
Patrick jiggles when he chuckles. Yeah. So what?

1187
01:01:28,180 --> 01:01:31,860
It's actually, it's one of your better qualities.

1188
01:01:31,860 --> 01:01:34,260
Right up with your bass skill. Alright.

1189
01:01:34,260 --> 01:01:37,460
Wait, play us out with a song. Play us a song.

1190
01:01:37,460 --> 01:01:38,260
Oh my god.

1191
01:01:38,260 --> 01:01:40,260
Bring us out with a song dude. No, I want to hear this.

1192
01:01:40,260 --> 01:01:41,700
Maybe he's gotten better since the beginning.

1193
01:01:49,140 --> 01:01:49,860
Sounds like shit.

1194
01:01:49,860 --> 01:01:55,460
Just play tool. Everyone wants to hear tool.

1195
01:01:55,460 --> 01:01:55,780
Okay.

1196
01:01:55,780 --> 01:02:01,860
I hit the D string. Wait, hold on.

1197
01:02:01,860 --> 01:02:10,340
No, I didn't say act like a tool.

1198
01:02:10,340 --> 01:02:11,940
What?

1199
01:02:11,940 --> 01:02:14,340
Son of a bitch.

1200
01:02:14,340 --> 01:02:15,780
I'm ending the episode now.

1201
01:02:15,780 --> 01:02:16,500
God damn it.

1202
01:02:16,500 --> 01:02:17,300
Bye y'all.

1203
01:02:17,300 --> 01:02:17,540
Bye.

1204
01:02:17,540 --> 01:02:18,040
