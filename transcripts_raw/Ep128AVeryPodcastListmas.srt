00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
You're listening to Israel's number one podcast.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,600
(laughing)

3
00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:07,760
- [Announcer] "House of the Hopeless."

4
00:00:07,760 --> 00:00:11,100
- You're a crap monster.

5
00:00:11,100 --> 00:00:11,940
(laughing)

6
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:12,920
(explosion)

7
00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:14,360
I was thinking of doing a--

8
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:15,200
- Ooh.

9
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:17,120
- To start like when you're talking about like

10
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:18,680
really, really rich people, be like,

11
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:21,680
oh fuck, I wanna be rich like Carlos Slim or Jeff Bezos

12
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:25,560
or like Mr. Beast, like one of the millionaires.

13
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:26,400
- Yeah, what's--

14
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:27,220
- Really, really--

15
00:00:27,220 --> 00:00:28,840
- Why, who is Mr. Beast

16
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:30,840
Why does he have all this money? He's me in disguise

17
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:36,960
That's why I have money that answer make questions. Yeah, it makes sense. What are the richest guys ever?

18
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:42,840
He basically he's the guy who gives money to homeless people right or like black people cars and stuff. Yeah

19
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:47,580
Yeah, so what he does is he just goes to the whole off. He finds a homeless person that has a million dollars

20
00:00:47,580 --> 00:00:52,800
And then he just gives it back to them as for the video. True. Oh, yeah

21
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:57,720
Yeah, or if it's like a sick. Yeah, exactly. Yeah, and that's fucked up

22
00:00:58,360 --> 00:01:01,120
Yeah, and that's and let that be a lesson to all you out there

23
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:04,840
There are a lot of homeless people walking around that already have a million dollars

24
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:09,640
And you know they they beg out for I see you store and then they go walk

25
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:17,100
They're just never satisfied they don't understand that they could buy a house with a million dollars

26
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:25,400
This is what it is more and more and more grind. Okay, they can't stop grinding. Is that awesome? Yeah, is it confusing? Yeah

27
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:32,400
that

28
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:38,280
board you have five million dollars how frugal are these guys they must have

29
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:45,960
taken Dave Ramsey's fucking course on on economic responsibility yeah I think that

30
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:53,360

Christmas!

34
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:04,840
Do you think every time Mr. Beast tries to get laid, the girl is like, "Maybe this is

35
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:05,840
one of the best."

36
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:06,840
Do you think that...

37
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:13,400
I gave this poor girl two inches of penis.

38
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:17,400
Her reaction was awesome.

39
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:20,480
Do you think Mr. Beast ever gives out candy canes on Christmas?

40
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:21,800

00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:48,660
Think I'm too hyphy for this

169
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:57,080
Dude to be gone when I when I see a cute animal I scream in terror when I see a scary spider I pet it

170
00:10:57,860 --> 00:11:02,900
Yeah, see see I'm about me I'm about being hyphy and being from the Bay Area

171
00:11:02,900 --> 00:11:06,140
You're not from the Bay Area. Not e40

172
00:11:06,140 --> 00:11:10,140
Say you're a 40 dude. Stop going as I think I'm

173
00:11:10,140 --> 00:11:18,700
The way it the way that now the way this episode is a thing is about instead of e40 soon

174
00:11:18,700 --> 00:11:22,380
We're pretty soon. We're gonna be looking at d25. Mm-hmm Wow

175
00:11:24,260 --> 00:11:25,260
Oh, December.

176
00:11:25,260 --> 00:11:26,260
Yeah.

177
00:11:26,260 --> 00:11:27,260
Okay.

178
00:11:27,260 --> 00:11:28,260
That's right.

179
00:11:28,260 --> 00:11:29,260
That's Christmas.

180
00:11:29,260 --> 00:11:30,900
I thought it was the 25 year anniversary of Disney.

181
00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:33,980
It's kind of the 25 year anniversary of the podcast today.

182
00:11:33,980 --> 00:11:34,980
It's true.

183
00:11:34,980 --> 00:11:35,980
It's tomorrow.

184
00:11:35,980 --> 00:11:36,980
Tomorrow.

185
00:11:36,980 --> 00:11:37,980
What do you mean?

186
00:11:37,980 --> 00:11:38,980
Why do you keep saying that?

187
00:11:38,980 --> 00:11:39,980
Because it's tomorrow.

188
00:11:39,980 --> 00:11:40,980
I thought you were goth.

189
00:11:40,980 --> 00:11:41,980
Do you mean tomorrow?

190
00:11:41,980 --> 00:11:42,980
You're obsessed with rules and time.

191
00:11:42,980 --> 00:11:43,980
Yeah.

192
00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:44,980
Do you mean tomorrow when the episode comes out?

193
00:11:44,980 --> 00:11:45,980
No, I mean the day after this episode comes out.

194
00:11:45,980 --> 00:11:46,980
A goth is so depressed with music that he doesn't even know what day it is.

195
00:11:46,980 --> 00:11:47,980
Okay.

196
00:11:47,980 --> 00:11:48,980
Wait.

197
00:11:48,980 --> 00:11:49,980
Wait.

198
00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:50,980
Wait.

199
00:11:50,980 --> 00:11:51,980
The anniversary of the podcast is Christmas Eve.

200
00:11:51,980 --> 00:11:52,980
Wait.

201
00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:53,980
Wait.

202
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:54,980
Christmas Eve.

203
00:11:54,980 --> 00:11:56,980
Okay, you could have just said that.

204
00:11:56,980 --> 00:11:59,980
Well, I told you that so many times.

205
00:11:59,980 --> 00:12:02,980
I truly don't remember at all.

206
00:12:02,980 --> 00:12:03,980
I think we must have.

207
00:12:03,980 --> 00:12:06,980
Originally, it was supposed to be a Christmas podcast.

208
00:12:06,980 --> 00:12:10,980
We must have been like, "It would be funny if we released this on Christmas Eve."

209
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:14,980
That must have been the thought process, because I don't know why else we would do that.

210
00:12:14,980 --> 00:12:15,980
Yeah, that was a horrible move.

211
00:12:15,980 --> 00:12:19,980
People were so busy opening gifts, they couldn't listen.

212
00:12:19,980 --> 00:12:20,980
Yeah, that's true.

213
00:12:20,980 --> 00:12:22,980
It made it very hard for us.

214
00:12:22,980 --> 00:12:26,340
for us. We got pigeonholed as a Christmas podcast for the first year and a half.

215
00:12:26,340 --> 00:12:31,860
Yeah, people kept listening. It's like they didn't even talk about the naughty or nice list.

216
00:12:31,860 --> 00:12:34,580
Yeah, speaking of that's what I thought.

217
00:12:34,580 --> 00:12:36,020
Are you guys drafting? Yeah.

218
00:12:36,020 --> 00:12:45,540
Nice list, Patrick. Naughty list, Caleb. That's my first picks. That's what I want to be because

219
00:12:45,540 --> 00:12:50,580
I'm... well you guys know by now. All right, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry. Nice list, Patrick.

220
00:12:51,620 --> 00:12:57,140
Stupid list Caleb stupid is the same as naughty to me because of how good you're stupid. No

221
00:12:57,140 --> 00:13:03,520
I'm on the often stupid. I'm on the nice list cuz I'm so hyphy. I'm so good with it

222
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:10,740
You're not guys give some stop arguing about who's goth and who's not and just start just a long pipe adding to your life

223
00:13:10,740 --> 00:13:12,740
II he's like e4 like oh

224
00:13:12,740 --> 00:13:15,500
Do the list say it naughty and nice?

225
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:18,020
naughty is

226
00:13:20,020 --> 00:13:21,940
Fuck

227
00:13:21,940 --> 00:13:26,600
Naughty has to be from this year. The terrifier is definitely

228
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:35,200
Big facts, no cap detected. Yeah, and the nice list I'm gonna give it to you know

229
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:40,700
President Donald Trump. He's been pretty nice this year, you know, he hasn't done too much

230
00:13:40,700 --> 00:13:44,380
I mean, I not really not really but it's his last year kind of a courtesy pick

231
00:13:44,380 --> 00:13:44,660
Yeah

232
00:13:44,660 --> 00:13:50,860
I mean, you know, you can't go if he got went four years in a row getting naughty list that he would just be devastated

233
00:13:50,860 --> 00:13:55,460
You don't even I think you you can't get back on the nice list after four years in a row of naughty

234
00:13:55,460 --> 00:14:00,060
So I think I think it switched off every year. I think around Christmas time every year

235
00:14:00,060 --> 00:14:02,620
He did do something to get himself back on the nice list

236
00:14:02,620 --> 00:14:05,420
He pardoned a turkey and that was oh

237
00:14:05,420 --> 00:14:10,180
Yeah, do that ever. You know what he does that he did that every year for four years

238
00:14:10,540 --> 00:14:14,700
It's kind of a Thanksgiving. Oh, it's out of a Christmas thing, but so it

239
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:19,740
Yeah, all right, so mine I have three lists so obviously

240
00:14:19,740 --> 00:14:21,980

241
00:14:21,980 --> 00:14:28,920
I'm gonna put Parson Brown on there. Mm-hmm. Nice. I mean, I mean just you got to give it up for this guy

242
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:34,300
Yeah, what is nice this year? I mean like I haven't heard about that guy since I don't know

00:18:52,180 --> 00:18:55,920
now that i mean it looked like you go to our kind of work a quick look at it over

291
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:56,400
then

292
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:58,460

294
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:06,160
now it doesn't know that it says on the most as you act the most weird towards

295
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:07,080
people

296
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:10,720
it's a little bit about what would they put that on the high-flying i think i

297
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:13,480
think they mean i think it says you have the most it says you have the most

298
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:18,300
problems patrick what does that even mean give a little less than two i think

299
00:19:18,300 --> 00:19:21,820
what does it mean the most problems is that i don't like a mental issues that

300
00:19:21,820 --> 00:19:24,840
you have is a counter to a lot of obstacles arm

301
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:30,440
my problem is on most i_d_ and i have too much money

302
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:33,880
and swag patrick it's as you've been acting up on here

303
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:36,040
yet then acting up in the club

304
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:38,860
now doesn't say in the club

305
00:19:38,860 --> 00:19:43,080
yet as you've been acting out you back to nothing your grandma's house

306
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:46,700
that's the closest here that your grandma made you sit in the corner chair

307
00:19:46,700 --> 00:19:48,340
it is you know maybe you put it

308
00:19:48,340 --> 00:19:52,940
it's a good idea to have a great backwards i was being too high fee

309
00:19:52,940 --> 00:19:56,100
so that's what i think that's your use there is because you're acting weird

310
00:19:56,100 --> 00:19:59,420
there is a i mean you failed your height the test is that yes i think that's

311
00:19:59,420 --> 00:20:00,100
right here

312
00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:02,860
it does right here you feel your testimony of a teacher comment that says

313
00:20:02,860 --> 00:20:06,020
that boy and right and then it says they sent you back to kindergarten yet so

314
00:20:06,020 --> 00:20:09,020
that boy it says that way too hot right now

315
00:20:09,020 --> 00:20:12,660

365
00:22:58,440 --> 00:23:07,160
a food-centered naughty nice list. I'm just I'm just thinking. Nice list, Anthony Pelosi

366
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:15,840
or whatever her name is from TV for giving us so much money. That's enough to buy ten

367
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:22,720
games. Naughty list has to be the man made out of piss I had a dream about last night.

368
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:27,720
Yeah, and it kept dripping on me and he'd say, "Hey, you got piss on ya!"

369
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:29,720
And I'd be like, "Dude, it's from you, man."

370
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:34,720
But then I woke up and I was like, "I'm just gonna be goth instead of think about what this means."

371
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:39,720
My nice list, uh, gonna put Israel on there.

372
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:40,720
Yep.

373
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:45,720
Get you that money. We gotta get you that stimmy check, Israel.

374
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:46,720
We gotta get you that money.

375
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:49,720
I don't like how many times you're saying "get you."

376
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:50,720
What?

377
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:57,720
it

378
00:23:57,720 --> 00:24:04,080
I don't know man. No, it's just my New Hampshire accent. It's winking so much. It's my New Hampshire accent

379
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:07,640
I say oh you can't hold up that symbol in a zoom call

380
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:13,980
You're gonna get banned from zoom by me accent is when you slur all your speech

381
00:24:13,980 --> 00:24:21,440
And yeah, it's also when you speak all your slurs dude, mm-hmm, that's right

382
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:39,880
a

383
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:54,880
for

384
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:56,880
Oh, that kid got a rock.

385
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:58,880
[laughter]

386
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:00,880
It's Charlie Brown.

387
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:02,880
Yeah.

388
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:04,880
Yeah, Charlie Brown is Palestinian.

389
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:08,880
Yeah, Charlie Brown got a rock and he's throwing it at a tank.

390
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:10,880
No.

391
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:12,880
That's not true.

392
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:14,880
Yeah, it is true.

393
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:16,880
That is true, actually.

394
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:18,880
Yeah, you know, maybe it is.

395
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:22,880
That's the new tick to make after you make a stupid joke and just go, "Yeah, that's true."

396
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:23,880
That is true.

397
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:25,280
Yeah, you know what, that's right.

398
00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:26,280
Yeah, that's right.

399
00:25:26,280 --> 00:25:29,280
No, yeah, of course that happened.

400
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:33,280
Alright, in honor of ourselves.

401
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:36,280
We love to honor ourselves so much.

402
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:42,280
So we're honoring ourselves by doing our, is this our first ever list?

403
00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:44,280
Yeah, so this is our first ever list that we did.

404
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:46,280
This was like our trial.

405
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:50,280
This is when we record, before we even like put, this episode was never posted.

406
00:25:50,280 --> 00:26:08,280
the

407
00:26:08,280 --> 00:26:10,280
I

408
00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:14,520
they have this whole website archived so we can come back to this whenever we

409
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:18,080
could we did a bunch of these already we have to remember which ones we did yeah

410
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:21,320
but it doesn't matter because they probably don't exist anyway but yeah

411
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:26,680
this list is a top 10 monstrous people that are not human being

412
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:32,880
I'm being hit by so many amazing memories right now.

413
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:33,880
Yeah dude.

414
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:34,880
Nostalgia.

415
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:35,880
I don't remember fucking any of this.

416
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:38,200
That's because you were not around dude.

417
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:42,560
Yeah Pat can you leave for the second half of this episode?

418
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:44,560
I think we knew each other at this point.

419
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:45,920
Shut up scumbag.

420
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:47,720
I did not know Patrick at this point.

421
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:50,080
What are you talking about?

422
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:52,280
We were friends on Facebook.

423
00:26:52,280 --> 00:26:53,280
That doesn't mean anything.

424
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:54,880
I'm friends with like 4000 people on Facebook.

425
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:59,680
Yeah but we used to... I'm just saying I don't know Patrick, I didn't know Patrick.

426
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:05,680
I never met... We used to do a... oh yeah, probably never met you but we would go into Ascension, Fifth Dimension and stuff.

427
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:09,380
I met Patrick. We would play together. We would play on Facebook with each other.

428
00:27:09,380 --> 00:27:12,880
I met Patrick and I didn't remember that I met him for a long time.

429
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:21,380
But I had met him one time here because he was so kind of forgettable and bland and just lacked kind of any impression to be made on.

430
00:27:21,380 --> 00:27:25,700
He was dressed in a button-down shirt and khakis and he went "Hey guys" and he was wearing

431
00:27:25,700 --> 00:27:30,060
big glasses and his hair was slicked back and he had a pocket protector.

432
00:27:30,060 --> 00:27:33,140
Yeah, I was wearing a mask before all this covid crap.

433
00:27:33,140 --> 00:27:34,140
He's dressed like an uncle.

434
00:27:34,140 --> 00:27:37,140
He's dressed like Steve Uncle.

435
00:27:37,140 --> 00:27:40,620
I kept walking around like "Can I do that?"

436
00:27:40,620 --> 00:27:41,620
Can I do this?

437
00:27:41,620 --> 00:27:42,620
Can I do that?

438
00:27:42,620 --> 00:27:43,620
Can I do that?

439
00:27:43,620 --> 00:27:44,620
Shut the fuck up bro.

440
00:27:44,620 --> 00:27:46,980
Just fucking up to people.

441
00:27:46,980 --> 00:27:49,300
Can I do that?

442
00:27:49,300 --> 00:27:51,740
That's Urkel with social anxiety.

443
00:27:51,740 --> 00:27:54,740
Can I do that?

444
00:27:54,740 --> 00:27:57,740
I'd like to see Urkel throw it in a circle.

445
00:27:57,740 --> 00:28:03,900
I'm just saying Urkel, just going up to people like, people just like having a picnic in the

446
00:28:03,900 --> 00:28:07,340
park and just going, "Can I do that?"

447
00:28:07,340 --> 00:28:10,020
No Urkel, get away from me.

448
00:28:10,020 --> 00:28:11,020
Leave me alone.

449
00:28:11,020 --> 00:28:13,900
Stop it Urkel.

450
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:15,300
Get out of here white Urkel.

451
00:28:15,300 --> 00:28:17,860
Get the fuck out of here.

452
00:28:17,860 --> 00:28:20,260
i'm at a picnic

453
00:28:20,260 --> 00:28:21,800

454
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:26,540
number one most monstrous people are not human being number ten most monstrous

455
00:28:26,540 --> 00:28:28,640
people are not human being

456
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:30,780
yokozuna

457
00:28:30,780 --> 00:28:34,680
she's a super wrestler

458
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:39,260
we gotta read the the things but because these are very good descriptions

459
00:28:39,260 --> 00:28:42,700
yokozuna was a simone american professor at professional wrestler

460
00:28:42,700 --> 00:28:44,700
We gotta read this thing.

461
00:28:44,700 --> 00:28:46,700
(unintelligible)

462
00:28:46,700 --> 00:28:50,700
You read it then.

463
00:28:50,700 --> 00:28:52,700
Uh, Yokozuna.

464
00:28:52,700 --> 00:28:54,700
He was best known for his time with the World Wrestling Federation.

465
00:28:54,700 --> 00:28:56,700
The term Yokozuna refers to the highest rank

466
00:28:56,700 --> 00:28:58,700
of professional sumo wrestling in Japan.

467
00:28:58,700 --> 00:29:00,700
Um, blah blah blah.

468
00:29:00,700 --> 00:29:02,700
Standing at 6'4" and weighing an immense

469
00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:04,700
589 pounds, the Yokozuna squashed

470
00:29:04,700 --> 00:29:06,700
legends like Bret Hart, The Undertaker, and Hulk Hogan

471
00:29:06,700 --> 00:29:08,700
on his way to becoming one of the most dominant

472
00:29:08,700 --> 00:29:10,700
WWE champions of all time.

473
00:29:10,700 --> 00:29:16,220
October 23rd, 2000, Yokozuna died from pulmonary edema, I don't know.

474
00:29:16,220 --> 00:29:17,220
Funky cold, Medina.

475
00:29:17,220 --> 00:29:22,740
In his room in England while on an independent wrestling tour in Europe.

476
00:29:22,740 --> 00:29:26,940
Being very, this is the last line, being very tall and absolutely massive at nearly 600

477
00:29:26,940 --> 00:29:34,340
pounds, there is no way Yokozuna was human, just like the rest of his family.

478
00:29:34,340 --> 00:29:36,940
Yeah that's my reaction anytime I see anybody kind of big.

479
00:29:36,940 --> 00:29:39,220
Yeah, you and your family are not human.

480
00:29:39,220 --> 00:29:40,580
First off, you're not human.

481
00:29:40,580 --> 00:29:43,500
Second off, your sisters cannot be human either.

482
00:29:43,500 --> 00:29:45,540
Your mom and dad are not human.

483
00:29:45,540 --> 00:29:46,540
You're an alien.

484
00:29:46,540 --> 00:29:47,540
You're an alien.

485
00:29:47,540 --> 00:29:48,540
You're just an alien.

486
00:29:48,540 --> 00:29:51,460
Dude, Roman Reigns and The Rock were his cousins, it says here.

487
00:29:51,460 --> 00:29:53,500
I can't believe I skipped that.

488
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:54,500
Whoa.

489
00:29:54,500 --> 00:29:55,500
What?

490
00:29:55,500 --> 00:29:56,500
Roman Reigns, Rikishi, Umaga, and The Rock.

491
00:29:56,500 --> 00:29:57,500
That's what it says.

492
00:29:57,500 --> 00:29:59,060
He was a member of the Anoa'i wrestling family.

493
00:29:59,060 --> 00:30:03,100
Roman Reigns, Rikishi, Umaga, and The Rock were just some of his cousins.

494
00:30:03,100 --> 00:30:06,020
Damn, I'd hate to see some of his other cousins.

495
00:30:06,020 --> 00:30:07,020
I know.

496
00:30:07,020 --> 00:30:08,020
Damn.

497
00:30:08,020 --> 00:30:15,020
the

498
00:30:15,020 --> 00:30:30,500

00:30:30,500 --> 00:30:52,320
to

500
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:55,320
from the same pineapple and their Samoan cousins.

501
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:56,320
Yeah.

502
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:57,320
You know?

503
00:30:57,320 --> 00:30:58,320
Yeah.

504
00:30:58,320 --> 00:31:03,320
Number nine, Sun Ming Ming.

505
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:06,320
Sun Ming Ming is a Chinese basketball player.

506
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:09,320
He currently stands at 7'9" and weighs 370 pounds.

507
00:31:09,320 --> 00:31:10,320
That's a big motherfucker.

508
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:11,320
Yeah.

509
00:31:11,320 --> 00:31:12,320
Goddamn.

510
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:15,320
Wears size 20 shoes, makes occasional appearances as an actor.

511
00:31:15,320 --> 00:31:17,320
Dude, maybe we can get him for our movie.

512
00:31:17,320 --> 00:31:18,320
Holy shit.

513
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:19,320
Oh my god, that's such a big--

514
00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:24,440
In the summer of 2005, Sun discovered that he had a brain tumor attached to his pituitary

515
00:31:24,440 --> 00:31:25,440
gland.

516
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:28,840
Because he had neither medical or neither health insurance nor enough money to pay for more

517
00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:35,040
than $100,000 in medical bills, his sports agent, Charles Bonseigneur, started...

518
00:31:35,040 --> 00:31:37,400
Charles, Charles Bonseigneur.

519
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:44,760
Wait, he was a basketball player and he didn't have health insurance?

520
00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:51,760
sports agent who only represents giant Chinese guys. No you have to, the giant Chinese man

521
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:57,440
is my... You are the biggest Chinese man I ever seen. You are the biggest Chinese man

522
00:31:57,440 --> 00:32:04,440
I ever seen. You've been an amazing addition to my life. You are not a human being. You

523
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:09,560
are a giant Chinese man. You are a monstrous people, cannot be human being. You are a huge

524
00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:15,900
Chinese evil man, let me let me introduce you to my to my friend here this statue liberty

525
00:32:15,900 --> 00:32:18,360
You are a Chinese dragon to me

526
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:23,400
The tumor was successfully removed dude, yeah

527
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:27,160
On March 11th son

528
00:32:27,160 --> 00:32:34,160
2007 son was part of the tallest lineup in the world on the Maryland Nighthawks with four players over seven feet tall

529
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:35,800
So I never made it to the NBA

530
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:40,860
But if he did he would have been the tallest person in the NBA's history although. He does not look like a monster

531
00:32:40,860 --> 00:32:44,780
He is a limitless one and frightens every person that stands in his path

532
00:32:44,780 --> 00:32:50,460
Without disbelief it is safe to say he is not a human being at nearly 8 foot in a 400 pounds

533
00:32:50,460 --> 00:32:53,040
Jesus Christ

534
00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:55,040
You are a limitless monster

535
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:57,040
You are a limitless monster

536
00:32:57,040 --> 00:32:59,040
You are a limitless monster

537
00:32:59,040 --> 00:33:01,040
You are like Bradley Cooper

538
00:33:01,040 --> 00:33:03,040
You are a limitless person

539
00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:05,040
You are disgusting to me

540
00:33:05,040 --> 00:33:08,240
You are a lumpy old leg of the snake!

You are a naughty monster!

548
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:24,240
You are a disgusting monster!

549
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:28,240
Let me drink your bones like a deer drinking from his water bottle!

550
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:30,240
I love you so much!

551
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:32,240
You are my new son!

552
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:34,240
You are my big Chinese monster son!

553
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:39,280
I love you like a my grandson. I am going to give you a brain to me

554
00:33:39,280 --> 00:33:42,240

I've got to get you to take up the main say it. Yeah

559
00:34:04,520 --> 00:34:11,880
You look like a beast that rose out of Davy Jones lucker. I need to use you as an anchor

560
00:34:11,880 --> 00:34:14,520
You're not allowed to flush in my house

561
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:22,360
I have to clone you. I'm a pirate, but I must know a scientist

562
00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:25,520
Clone you in the name of research

563
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:36,720
large hadron collider. I sail the seven seas of the large hadron collider.

564
00:34:36,720 --> 00:34:48,240
All right number eight big show. He he looks human he can't be a monster.

565
00:34:48,240 --> 00:34:54,320
I was gonna read hey okay go ahead I thought you weren't because you just started talking.

566
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:58,720
Galleying which I didn't like much. Yeah read it if you're gonna read it. He is a feared competitor

567
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:03,520
who intimidates opponents with his size and stare alone. Just like Andre the Giant, he used to have

568
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:15,280
a Cro-Megili. What's that? A Cro-Megili, a disease of the endocrine system. On his 12th birthday,

569
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:22,080
he was 6'2" and weighed 220 pounds and had chest hair. Currently, he stands at an unbelievable

570
00:35:22,080 --> 00:35:29,960
7 feet tall, weighs a massive 450 pounds, wears a huge 18 US size shoe, and has an incredible

571
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:37,560
64 inch chest. I bet his aunts were so weird to him. Oh, yeah. Oh my god run their fingers to his chest here

572
00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:43,200
Yeah, yeah, you're so big for your age. Oh, you're gonna be a basketball or linebacker

573
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:54,520
You're gonna be a giant fat inhuman monster, oh you're gonna be so gross. Oh, you're gonna be disgusting. Oh

574
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:59,580
I'm gonna hate looking at you when you walk down the street. I'm gonna chase you with an angry mob.

575
00:35:59,580 --> 00:36:02,780
On your 21st birthday, I'm gonna walk in and I'm gonna vomit.

576
00:36:02,780 --> 00:36:06,780
Oh, I'm gonna chase you with pitchforks and torches when I see you.

577
00:36:06,780 --> 00:36:08,780
I'm gonna run you back to your swamp.

578
00:36:08,780 --> 00:36:10,780
You could be a member of the Dark Carnival if you wanted, honey.

579
00:36:10,780 --> 00:36:13,780
[Laughter]

580
00:36:13,780 --> 00:36:16,780
Oh, oh honey, this way comes!

581
00:36:16,780 --> 00:36:22,780
Honey, who was our friend? Who was our friend? PT Barnum? PT Barnum, yeah, we can introduce you to him.

582
00:36:22,780 --> 00:36:28,620
Who was that friend? Who was that friend? Who was that sorcerer who was looking for a brutal giant servant to

583
00:36:28,620 --> 00:36:31,260
smack together the heads of his opponents?

584
00:36:31,260 --> 00:36:34,460
Uh, Magnifico the evil.

585
00:36:34,460 --> 00:36:38,460
Oh, Magnifico. Yeah, it was- I'll put you in contact with him.

586
00:36:38,460 --> 00:36:40,460
Oh, Big Show, you have to meet Magnifico.

587
00:36:40,460 --> 00:36:44,860
He doesn't have a cell phone. He's one of those. Just talk into the shell at midnight.

588
00:36:44,860 --> 00:36:49,500
That's why you- well, listen, Big Show, when you meet Magnifico, just walk hunched over, okay? He'll like you more that way.

589
00:36:49,500 --> 00:36:52,700
Honey, did you bring the orb? Did you bring the orb, honey?

590
00:36:52,700 --> 00:36:53,900
*laughter*

591
00:36:53,900 --> 00:36:56,700
Okay, we're gonna look at the most amazing orb.

592
00:36:56,700 --> 00:36:59,500
Well, go look in the fucking car! It might be in the fucking car!

593
00:36:59,500 --> 00:37:01,100
*laughter*

594
00:37:01,100 --> 00:37:05,900
Honey, I know I brought the orb. I know, I know. Check the fucking trunk, honey!

595
00:37:05,900 --> 00:37:08,300
Oh my god, it's in my pocket. I feel like an idiot.

596
00:37:08,300 --> 00:37:09,100
*laughter*

597
00:37:09,100 --> 00:37:09,600
Well, you have to-

598
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:12,700
Oh, it's like a one-foot-in-diameter orb.

599
00:37:12,700 --> 00:37:14,300
*laughter*

600
00:37:14,300 --> 00:37:17,700
To call Magnifico, just read a Bible verse backwards.

601
00:37:17,700 --> 00:37:19,500
It'll pick up really fast.

602
00:37:19,500 --> 00:37:25,540
Just say Mecca Mecca like a high Mecca. Honey, honey. Ho just like peewee just like me play house like you're talking to John B

00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:25,360
Big show you and you and him should be friends Magnifico jr. You would love him. You know my youngest raid in the Magnifico

614
00:38:25,360 --> 00:38:32,720
My youngest he's 12 he's going through one of these phases he's keep saying he wants to be good when he grows up

615
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:35,280
Oh, they grow out of it. Don't worry. I mean I

616
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:37,200
out of it

617
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:43,920
Devil will is I mean just the other day you forged this this glowing golden blade and he was trying to slay me with it

618
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:49,440
What oh my god cut me an arm. Is he making crucifixes because I would love that

619
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:51,840
I would love a new one to hang up at my home

620
00:38:51,840 --> 00:38:57,040
Just an Irish Catholic who's friends with all these deep

621
00:38:57,040 --> 00:39:05,320
Last the last line of Big Show is Big Show is not a human being but rather a vicious beast

622
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:09,320
We just skipped over it. Yeah, he I guess he flipped a Jeep

623
00:39:09,320 --> 00:39:19,280
In 20 or yeah 2005 he flipped a Jeep over and that's number seven is the great Kali

624
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:25,360
The guy is an Indian professional wrestler actor and powerlifter. Although his parents are well in range of normal height

625
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:31,400
His grandfather was over six foot six the great Kali also has acromegaly that causes facial distortion

626
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:47,180
deformities, distortions. As you can tell by his large brow, nose, chin, and ears. At 42 years old, he stands at a crazy 7'1" and weighs 347 pounds. It is not clear what shoe size he wears, but in Big Boss Season 4, he had worn an enormous US-sized 22 shoe.

627
00:39:47,180 --> 00:39:49,180
It's pretty fucking clear!

628
00:39:49,180 --> 00:39:52,780
In 2001, he even accidentally killed a guy!

629
00:39:52,780 --> 00:39:57,780
Brian Ong, for giving him a flapjack, a professional wrestling throw!

630
00:39:57,780 --> 00:40:02,780
In 2012, he underwent a brain surgery due to a tumor on his pituitary gland that prevented him from being able to stop growing.

631
00:40:02,780 --> 00:40:04,780
I'm seeing a pattern here.

632
00:40:04,780 --> 00:40:11,780
As one of the biggest WWE superstars of all time, the Great Khali is definitely not human, but rather a giant savage!

633
00:40:11,780 --> 00:40:15,780
He's in... yeah, he's the guy in the longest yard.

634
00:40:15,780 --> 00:40:20,540
Yeah, it's the only movie I know him from I don't know him from wrestling or anything

635
00:40:20,540 --> 00:40:25,340
I know him from the Adam Sandler jail comedy on this list. I don't know. Yeah, I think so, too

636
00:40:25,340 --> 00:40:28,100
I don't I'm looking up what he looks like right now. Oh

637
00:40:28,100 --> 00:40:31,580
Tumor on my fucking. Oh, yeah, dude

638
00:40:31,580 --> 00:40:35,940
Glen do you think there's like if you put your head in a microwave for a lot like maybe like

639
00:40:35,940 --> 00:40:40,580
Rig the microwave so that it opens the door stays open you put your head in there

640
00:40:40,580 --> 00:40:45,300
Where's your pituitary gland dude if I could raise the microwave for the door to stay open while it ran

641
00:40:45,300 --> 00:40:46,980
and that would be like the best day of my life.

642
00:40:46,980 --> 00:40:49,860
I could just watch, like I could just watch my food get warm.

643
00:40:49,860 --> 00:40:50,700
- True.

644
00:40:50,700 --> 00:40:51,520
- I guess that would--

645
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:52,360
- I guess that would get my face

646
00:40:52,360 --> 00:40:53,180
one inch away from the microwave.

647
00:40:53,180 --> 00:40:56,620
- No, that would fuck with your wifi, don't do that.

648
00:40:56,620 --> 00:40:57,460
- The wifi in your head?

649
00:40:57,460 --> 00:40:59,580
- Oh no, no, yeah, not my wifi.

650
00:40:59,580 --> 00:41:02,380
That's the main issue.

651
00:41:02,380 --> 00:41:03,900
- Yeah, it would fuck with your wifi

652
00:41:03,900 --> 00:41:05,860
and your neighbor's wifi.

653
00:41:05,860 --> 00:41:06,700
- Good. - Yeah.

654
00:41:06,700 --> 00:41:08,540
- And it would fuck with your wife's eyes,

655
00:41:08,540 --> 00:41:09,780
who she'd have to look at you.

656
00:41:09,780 --> 00:41:11,060
- If my neighbors don't have wifi,

657
00:41:11,060 --> 00:41:12,500
they're gonna have to make more Chinese food

658
00:41:12,500 --> 00:41:13,700
'cause they can't go online.

659
00:41:13,700 --> 00:41:14,700
I'm gonna be bored.

660
00:41:14,700 --> 00:41:17,900
I got to go to get to go smell that that's a win for cam.

661
00:41:17,900 --> 00:41:20,300
Yeah, they're Chinese though, right?

662
00:41:20,300 --> 00:41:21,400
I don't know.

663
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:23,800
They just make Chinese food all the time.

664
00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:27,600
Yeah, Chinese Cameron lives next to a Chinese restaurant.

665
00:41:27,600 --> 00:41:30,900
We are forgetting my neighbors make the most delicious food.

666
00:41:30,900 --> 00:41:38,000
Number six Emmanuel Emmanuel Emmanuel Yarborough.

667
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:38,500
Yep.

668
00:41:38,500 --> 00:41:42,000
It's a manual manual Yarborough's in America.

669
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,000

681
00:42:42,820 --> 00:42:50,820
Three times the size of the average person and ridiculously tall this sumo wrestler has no proof. He is a human being

Number five is Jorge Gonzalez

689
00:43:29,740 --> 00:43:33,580
Jorge Gonzalez was an Argentine basketball player and professional wrestler

690
00:43:33,580 --> 00:43:37,900
He was best known for his appearances in World Championship wrestling under the ring name El Gigante

691
00:43:37,900 --> 00:43:41,820
Now that's a good game, dude. It's scary

692
00:43:41,820 --> 00:43:48,500
Let's see. No superstar in sports entertainment history was as immense as giant Gonzalez

693
00:43:48,500 --> 00:43:51,940
Thought his name was giant instead of four

694
00:43:54,660 --> 00:44:01,320
Not big show not even the legendary Andre the giant he stood at a great seven foot six great height weighed

695
00:44:01,320 --> 00:44:07,640
460 pounds and he played the role of Manny a carnival sideshow giant in a

696
00:44:07,640 --> 00:44:15,500
1993 episode of Baywatch who befriends Hobie but later falls into the water and his large size makes it difficult to be rescued Wow

697
00:44:15,500 --> 00:44:18,540
That's so tragic. Oh wow

698
00:44:18,540 --> 00:44:22,760
I hate I befriend to Hobie but

699
00:44:24,140 --> 00:44:26,140
And I'm too large to be rescued

700
00:44:26,140 --> 00:44:30,340
That's you

701
00:44:30,340 --> 00:44:36,260
Hoby is Pamela Anderson's name. No. Yeah, she's Hobie. No

702
00:44:36,260 --> 00:44:49,260
Hoby is the goblin who lives underneath the dock at the beach. Oh, Hoby was a child on that show

703
00:44:49,260 --> 00:44:51,080
and

704
00:44:51,080 --> 00:44:52,520
And his name is Hobie.

705
00:44:52,520 --> 00:44:53,680
What's up, I'm Hobie.

706
00:44:53,680 --> 00:44:55,400
You wanna go play hoop and stick?

707
00:44:55,400 --> 00:44:57,760
Ah, it's me, Hobie Buchanan.

708
00:44:57,760 --> 00:44:58,760
I'm here.

709
00:44:58,760 --> 00:45:02,720
Let's go play stickball in the alley.

710
00:45:02,720 --> 00:45:06,760
I like this, uh, I like this last part.

711
00:45:06,760 --> 00:45:11,760
On September 22, 2010, Jorge Gonzalez died due to complications of diabetes and severe

712
00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:12,760
heart issues.

713
00:45:12,760 --> 00:45:14,880
His hometown of San Martin, Argentina.

714
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:16,920
He was just 44 years old.

715
00:45:16,920 --> 00:45:22,840
his lifetime he could not have been human but most likely a giant animal.

716
00:45:22,840 --> 00:45:25,360
Now that you're dead, you weren't even a person.

717
00:45:25,360 --> 00:45:27,040
You were just an animal to me.

718
00:45:27,040 --> 00:45:28,040
You were in your graves.

719
00:45:28,040 --> 00:45:31,480
I'm glad you died like a fucking dog that you are.

720
00:45:31,480 --> 00:45:33,280
You look like shit, you were too big.

721
00:45:33,280 --> 00:45:37,320
You kept getting- Hobie kept having to rescue your bum ass from the ocean but you were too

722
00:45:37,320 --> 00:45:38,940
damn big.

723
00:45:38,940 --> 00:45:39,940
Fuck you.

724
00:45:39,940 --> 00:45:40,940
Rest in piss.

725
00:45:40,940 --> 00:45:44,920
He must have had to go pretty far out in the ocean to be able to not stand up.

726
00:45:44,920 --> 00:45:55,080
be able to reach him. Yeah. Yeah. With Hobies with Hobies tractor beam that he invented in

727
00:45:55,080 --> 00:46:06,360
season five episode twenty two. Exactly. Maybe that's what put the pituitary. The tractor

728
00:46:06,360 --> 00:46:11,760
beam you guys remember that episode when Hobie became a scientist. Yeah. It'll be Hobie Buchanan

729
00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:16,760
Harvested alien technology from from Pamela Anderson's thingies.

730
00:46:16,760 --> 00:46:19,760
Hobie put a black hole on the beach again.

731
00:46:19,760 --> 00:46:22,760
We gotta fucking stuff it with your big ass hole.

732
00:46:22,760 --> 00:46:24,760
There goes Giant Gonzalez.

733
00:46:24,760 --> 00:46:28,760
He fell into the black hole and he's too big to be rescued.

734
00:46:28,760 --> 00:46:35,760
I guess we shouldn't even bother. He's probably too big to be rescued.

735
00:46:35,760 --> 00:46:38,760
He's too much like a giant animal to be rescued.

736
00:46:38,760 --> 00:46:42,760
I hope that episode he like he drowned like three feet of water.

737
00:46:42,760 --> 00:46:44,760
Yeah he fell like a kiddie pool.

738
00:46:44,760 --> 00:46:46,760
You know what he's already dead.

739
00:46:46,760 --> 00:46:48,760
He's too fucking tall for this.

740
00:46:48,760 --> 00:46:53,760
That guy you know now that he's in the water I just have to say I've always thought that guy might be a giant animal.

741
00:46:53,760 --> 00:46:59,760
Hobie what did I tell you about making friends with extremely huge non-humans?

742
00:46:59,760 --> 00:47:01,760
You bastard.

743
00:47:01,760 --> 00:47:05,760
Number four Andre the Giant. We all know this guy.

744
00:47:05,760 --> 00:47:20,200
this

745
00:47:20,200 --> 00:47:37,200
you

746
00:47:37,200 --> 00:47:51,260
to

747
00:47:51,260 --> 00:47:54,260
a total of store for husky boys

748
00:47:54,260 --> 00:47:59,260
it's just casual mail excel toilets

749
00:47:59,260 --> 00:48:03,260
there are toilets that

750
00:48:03,260 --> 00:48:07,260
there are toilets that have like suction in a way that it sucks all your fat down

751
00:48:07,260 --> 00:48:10,260
so it doesn't look like you're fat when you're sitting on it

752
00:48:10,260 --> 00:48:12,260
it's like a slimming toilet

753
00:48:12,260 --> 00:48:16,260
it's like that thing in the simpsons where kent brockman has like the clips on his neck

754
00:48:16,260 --> 00:48:19,260
yeah yeah yeah

755
00:48:19,260 --> 00:48:24,380
he weighed 520 pounds I don't think we did we talk about this how he was like

756
00:48:24,380 --> 00:48:25,940
not as big as they say was

757
00:48:25,940 --> 00:48:28,980
yeah but then we said that he was big

758
00:48:28,980 --> 00:48:32,340

760
00:48:36,340 --> 00:48:37,380

766
00:48:50,100 --> 00:48:51,100

767
00:48:51,100 --> 00:48:53,380

00:48:53,380 --> 00:48:56,380
well i mean i need to read the last line though.

769
00:48:56,380 --> 00:49:00,220
eventually his heart- his size was just too much for his heart and he died in paris in

770
00:49:00,220 --> 00:49:03,660
his hotel room on january 27th 1993.

771
00:49:03,660 --> 00:49:07,460
there is no way this guy was human but rather a behemoth.

772
00:49:07,460 --> 00:49:13,540
i love every like sentence that's like "ah tragically he passed away."

Vaino...

808
00:50:10,540 --> 00:50:34,540
in

809
00:50:34,540 --> 00:50:37,700
seven foot three and weighed 434 pounds at the age of 21,

810
00:50:37,700 --> 00:50:40,020
but experienced a second phase of growth in his late 30s,

811
00:50:40,020 --> 00:50:42,220
attaining a height of a giant eight foot three.

812
00:50:42,220 --> 00:50:45,580
He is considered the tallest soldier ever,

813
00:50:45,580 --> 00:50:47,700
having served in the Finnish defense forces.

814
00:50:47,700 --> 00:50:48,940
That's pretty sick, dude.

815
00:50:48,940 --> 00:50:52,860
- That would suck getting another growth spurt at like 30.

816
00:50:52,860 --> 00:50:53,700
- That would really suck.

817
00:50:53,700 --> 00:50:55,140
- If you're already that tall, I mean for me,

818
00:50:55,140 --> 00:50:57,580
but like if you're a giant and then just being like,

819
00:50:57,580 --> 00:51:00,100
ah, I can't stop fucking growing.

820
00:51:00,100 --> 00:51:02,420
- Imagine being a drill sergeant

821
00:51:02,420 --> 00:51:30,860
and

822
00:51:30,860 --> 00:51:32,860
Also you get deflected with his metal teeth.

823
00:51:32,860 --> 00:51:33,860
Yeah.

824
00:51:33,860 --> 00:51:34,860
Yeah.

825
00:51:34,860 --> 00:51:38,460
He returned to Finland in 1939 to serve in the Finnish Army during the Winter War.

826
00:51:38,460 --> 00:51:43,660
In 1946, he moved to Jarvenpaa and ran a chicken farm.

827
00:51:43,660 --> 00:51:44,660
That's nice dude.

828
00:51:44,660 --> 00:51:45,660
Yeah, that sounds like a good life.

829
00:51:45,660 --> 00:51:49,100
He died in 1963 and is buried there.

830
00:51:49,100 --> 00:51:50,100
He's buried in 1963?

831
00:51:50,100 --> 00:51:53,020
We have to go back and get him back.

832
00:51:53,020 --> 00:51:56,660
He had a 15.7 inch hand span, the greatest known.

833
00:51:56,660 --> 00:52:01,900
As tall, heavy, and strong as he was, it is nearly impossible to call this guy human.

834
00:52:01,900 --> 00:52:05,180
This guy's in the army and his hand's that big.

835
00:52:05,180 --> 00:52:06,500
He doesn't hold any guns.

836
00:52:06,500 --> 00:52:07,500
Bazooka.

837
00:52:07,500 --> 00:52:09,340
He holds a cake and fires it like a gun.

838
00:52:09,340 --> 00:52:10,660
Yeah, he probably, you're right.

839
00:52:10,660 --> 00:52:15,060
I do feel like this list was written by Van Helsing.

840
00:52:15,060 --> 00:52:21,300
And at the end, everyone is like, "And another monster put in the dirt where he belongs."

841
00:52:21,300 --> 00:52:25,300
list is what's in the folders that Mulder and Scully are always flipping through the

842
00:52:25,300 --> 00:52:26,300
X-Files.

843
00:52:26,300 --> 00:52:30,580
Yeah, ever heard of Giant Gonzalez?

844
00:52:30,580 --> 00:52:34,220
Scully, he was friends with Hobie and then he fell into water.

845
00:52:34,220 --> 00:52:36,980
I don't believe in Giant Gonzalez.

846
00:52:36,980 --> 00:52:41,300
I don't believe in vicious beasts.

847
00:52:41,300 --> 00:52:42,300
John Rogan.

848
00:52:42,300 --> 00:52:43,300
Joe Rogan?

849
00:52:43,300 --> 00:52:48,300
Yeah, sure, on opposite day, Joe Rogan would be the biggest guy.

850
00:52:48,300 --> 00:52:49,300
I don't know.

851
00:52:49,300 --> 00:52:50,300
How--

852
00:52:50,300 --> 00:52:51,300
How--

853
00:52:51,300 --> 00:52:52,300
Joe Rogan is really small, right?

854
00:52:52,300 --> 00:52:53,300
Yeah, he's--

855
00:52:53,300 --> 00:52:54,300
No, no, no, no, no.

856
00:52:54,300 --> 00:52:55,300
He's like three foot--

857
00:52:55,300 --> 00:52:56,300
Three.

858
00:52:56,300 --> 00:52:57,300
Yeah, he's like a foot and a half tall.

859
00:52:57,300 --> 00:52:58,300
He's kind of like a gnome.

860
00:52:58,300 --> 00:52:59,300
That's why I moved to Austin, because it's a small city.

861
00:52:59,300 --> 00:53:00,300
Gnome Rogan.

862
00:53:00,300 --> 00:53:01,300
Gnome Gnoman.

863
00:53:01,300 --> 00:53:02,300
Gnome Rogan.

864
00:53:02,300 --> 00:53:03,300
Yeah, Gnome Rogan's there.

865
00:53:03,300 --> 00:53:04,300
He has a funny little hat.

866
00:53:04,300 --> 00:53:05,300
Jamie, Jamie.

867
00:53:05,300 --> 00:53:06,300
Hey, Jamie.

868
00:53:06,300 --> 00:53:07,300
Pull up that--

869
00:53:07,300 --> 00:53:08,300
Jamie, pull up that toadstool.

870
00:53:08,300 --> 00:53:09,300
Pull up that--

871
00:53:09,300 --> 00:53:10,300
I'm going to sit down.

872
00:53:10,300 --> 00:53:11,300
Pull up that Keebler recipe, Jamie.

873
00:53:11,300 --> 00:53:12,300
Jamie, pull up those cookies and some milk.

874
00:53:12,300 --> 00:53:19,300
the

875
00:53:19,300 --> 00:53:26,740
the

876
00:53:26,740 --> 00:53:33,260
the

877
00:53:33,260 --> 00:53:40,580
the

878
00:53:40,580 --> 00:53:42,820
in our tribe and her name's Smurfette.

879
00:53:42,820 --> 00:53:43,320
Yeah.

880
00:53:43,320 --> 00:53:44,980
See, see, no men would know.

881
00:53:44,980 --> 00:53:46,820
When young men, we need to know.

882
00:53:46,820 --> 00:53:49,380
You only should be eating pixie dust, okay?

883
00:53:49,380 --> 00:53:52,900
You need to clean the front yard that you sit in all day.

884
00:53:52,900 --> 00:53:54,580
You need to make sure it's cleaned up.

885
00:53:54,580 --> 00:53:58,260
You need to sweep the pine needles away from your toadstool, okay?

886
00:53:58,260 --> 00:53:58,580
That's-

887
00:53:58,580 --> 00:53:59,620
You need to make sure your toadstool-

888
00:53:59,620 --> 00:54:01,700
The only way you can have an ordered mind.

889
00:54:01,700 --> 00:54:05,940
All right, bucko, you need to make sure your toadstool is clean every day.

890
00:54:09,700 --> 00:54:11,700
Get up and clean your toadstool, bucko.

891
00:54:11,700 --> 00:54:15,700
You want to be casting at least one spell a day, okay?

892
00:54:15,700 --> 00:54:25,700
Now, lobsters are particularly scary because for us they're bigger than...

893
00:54:25,700 --> 00:54:28,700
Kind of a monster-sized creature.

894
00:54:28,700 --> 00:54:33,700
Kind of monsters to us, and I think that these monsters are...

895
00:54:33,700 --> 00:54:35,700
We need to boil them, we need to boil the ocean.

896
00:54:35,700 --> 00:54:42,700
ocean

897
00:54:42,700 --> 00:54:45,820
and all of the

898
00:54:45,820 --> 00:54:48,120
and peterson

899
00:54:48,120 --> 00:54:50,640
that's right

900
00:54:50,640 --> 00:54:51,940
yet

901
00:54:51,940 --> 00:54:55,640
pretty much okay and i was one of seventeen of people medical history to

902
00:54:55,640 --> 00:54:58,820
reach a height of a feeder more also the second allspurs never recorded after

903
00:54:58,820 --> 00:55:01,300
robert wadlow great spoiler

904
00:55:01,300 --> 00:55:04,820
fox spoiler for our loser

905
00:55:04,820 --> 00:55:08,260
by eighteen ninety nine he'd go into a height of eight foot six despite his

906
00:55:08,260 --> 00:55:12,020
exist success in this regard success

907
00:55:12,020 --> 00:55:14,980
and so she says it is a really great it would say

908
00:55:14,980 --> 00:55:18,580
he declined all offers to join the carnival inside shows john rogan's hands

909
00:55:18,580 --> 00:55:21,940
measured eleven inches in length as feet measured thirteen inches in length

910
00:55:21,940 --> 00:55:25,020
you could need to grow until his death which was in nineteen oh five at the age

911
00:55:25,020 --> 00:55:26,180
of just forty

912
00:55:26,180 --> 00:55:29,580
the twist with john rogan was that in the nearly nine feet tall he was only one

913
00:55:29,580 --> 00:55:31,200
hundred and seventy five pounds

914
00:55:31,200 --> 00:55:33,800
he was extremely skinny but ludicrously tall

915
00:55:33,800 --> 00:55:37,720
john was a gargantuan historic figure and in no way at all human

916
00:55:37,720 --> 00:55:40,320
uh...

917
00:55:40,320 --> 00:55:43,080
that last line always gets me

918
00:55:43,080 --> 00:55:46,400
i just love that he's literally not human

919
00:55:46,400 --> 00:55:49,440
he is such a freak

920
00:55:49,440 --> 00:55:50,960
i hate this guy

921
00:55:50,960 --> 00:55:54,440
if i saw him i would throw things at him

922
00:55:54,440 --> 00:55:56,960
he does look pretty fucking cute no cap

923
00:55:56,960 --> 00:56:00,240
i wouldn't throw things at a tall person you could throw one thing at that guy

924
00:56:00,240 --> 00:56:06,000
he'd fall over. You know what, that is true. It'd have to be pretty damn heavy if you just

925
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:12,240
like hit. The thing is, yeah, he'd probably be really good at basketball, but if you fucking

926
00:56:12,240 --> 00:56:14,960
crossed over on him, he'd just break both his legs immediately. Right, well that's the

927
00:56:14,960 --> 00:56:20,800
problem with tall basketball players. There's a lot of 7'6" guys in Europe who just can't

928
00:56:20,800 --> 00:56:26,320
play in the NBA because they just get owned. Right. Dude, Allen Iverson was like 5'5".

929
00:56:26,320 --> 00:56:47,140
I

930
00:56:47,140 --> 00:56:54,140
the

931
00:56:54,140 --> 00:57:00,180
Is where we big and so he looks pretty small what I thought I thought Alan Iverson was small

932
00:57:00,180 --> 00:57:05,300
He he's small for the NBA, but he was taller everybody everybody

933
00:57:05,300 --> 00:57:10,380
I know everybody I know is like Oh Alan Iverson was like pretty short for a bet. What the fuck? Yeah

934
00:57:10,380 --> 00:57:13,160
They're all like seven tall

935
00:57:13,160 --> 00:57:21,100
Six foot six. He's a fucking liar. Nobody lied to you. Everybody lied to me and everyone betrayed me

936
00:57:21,100 --> 00:57:26,700
Nobody betrayed you. Stop stealing the goth thing from me. I'm the betrayed one and you've been mean to me my whole life.

937
00:57:26,700 --> 00:57:31,700
I got betrayed. I got betrayed by somebody who told me Allen Iverson was 5'7".

938
00:57:31,700 --> 00:57:33,200
I got betrayed by God for letting me be born.

939
00:57:33,200 --> 00:57:36,200
Somebody told me Allen Iverson was 5'7", dude.

940
00:57:36,200 --> 00:57:37,200
Yeah, the liar.

941
00:57:37,200 --> 00:57:38,200
5'5", 5'7".

942
00:57:38,200 --> 00:57:39,200
The town liar.

943
00:57:39,200 --> 00:57:40,200
Yeah.

944
00:57:40,200 --> 00:57:41,200
Yeah.

945
00:57:41,200 --> 00:57:43,200
I'm gonna, I gotta go.

946
00:57:43,200 --> 00:57:44,200
No, you don't have to go.

947
00:57:44,200 --> 00:57:45,200
I gotta go.

948
00:57:45,200 --> 00:57:46,200
No, you don't have to go.

949
00:57:46,200 --> 00:57:49,200
No, you have to do the last one, Robert Wadlow.

950
00:57:49,200 --> 00:57:50,200
I gotta go.

951
00:57:50,200 --> 00:57:54,760
Inhuman beast that we have to talk about. Well now i'm looking at the shortest basketball players

952
00:57:54,760 --> 00:57:58,120
I know

953
00:57:58,120 --> 00:58:05,560
Oh, it's spud web is five web and mugsy bogues. You mixed up fucking spud web with alan iverson, dude

954
00:58:05,560 --> 00:58:10,680
Alan iverson's like one of the greatest fucking two guards ever. No, I don't know. I don't know

955
00:58:10,680 --> 00:58:17,560
I don't know who told me alan iverson is your brain dude, but whoever fucking told me you switched it to five seven

956
00:58:17,720 --> 00:58:23,160
You said five five five whoever told me alan iverson's five five i'm i you know what?

957
00:58:23,160 --> 00:58:25,880
Maybe they were talking about white iverson

958
00:58:25,880 --> 00:58:28,440
Oh, they might have been talking about

959
00:58:28,440 --> 00:58:33,960
That's a really good point. Let's see how tall that's post malone, right? Let's see how tall he is

960
00:58:33,960 --> 00:58:36,520
I think he's probably six feet as well

961
00:58:36,520 --> 00:58:39,080
uh

962
00:58:39,080 --> 00:58:41,560
Yeah, he's six feet tall

963
00:58:41,560 --> 00:58:43,240
What the fuck?

964
00:58:43,240 --> 00:58:46,880
is not a single iverson oh here it is your thing of will lose you've heard

965
00:58:46,880 --> 00:58:48,280
he's five four

966
00:58:48,280 --> 00:58:50,740
okay and the people also search for

967
00:58:50,740 --> 00:58:52,740
that's gotta be it

968
00:58:52,740 --> 00:58:55,100
you think of that iverson

969
00:58:55,100 --> 00:58:59,660
yeah robert wadlow is the tallest person in recorded history for whom there is

970
00:58:59,660 --> 00:59:01,420
irrefutable evidence

971
00:59:01,420 --> 00:59:04,880
he reached an earth-shattering eight foot eleven and wait a whopping four

972
00:59:04,880 --> 00:59:09,240
hundred thirty nine pounds at the age of his death

973
00:59:09,240 --> 00:59:13,860
at weight at the at his death at age twenty two on july fifteenth nineteen

974
00:59:13,860 --> 00:59:14,660
forty

975
00:59:14,660 --> 00:59:18,820
his great size and continued growth in adulthood were due to hyperplasia of his

976
00:59:18,820 --> 00:59:20,120
pituitary gland

977
00:59:20,120 --> 00:59:23,820
which results in an abnormally high level of h_g_h_

978
00:59:23,820 --> 00:59:29,320
he showed no indication of an end up to his growth even at the time of his death

979
00:59:29,320 --> 00:59:34,140
his family claim that robert was taller than his father at age eight

980
00:59:34,140 --> 00:59:38,160
true yes they had to get an expanding casket he just keeps growing and growing

981
00:59:38,160 --> 00:59:39,660
He's like 20 feet tall now.

982
00:59:39,660 --> 00:59:41,160
Yeah.

983
00:59:41,160 --> 00:59:43,760
They had to make a special desk for him due to his size.

984
00:59:43,760 --> 00:59:46,300
After graduating from Alton High School in 1936,

985
00:59:46,300 --> 00:59:48,840
he enrolled at Shirtless College.

986
00:59:48,840 --> 00:59:50,280
Shirtless College, dude.

987
00:59:50,280 --> 00:59:50,780
Yeah.

988
00:59:50,780 --> 00:59:51,680
Signed me up.

989
00:59:51,680 --> 00:59:53,680
Hey, they didn't have shirts big enough for him.

990
00:59:53,680 --> 00:59:56,920
I'm going to take 16 credits at Shirtless College.

991
00:59:56,920 --> 00:59:58,080
And it's going to go ahead.

992
00:59:58,080 --> 00:59:59,920
I'm taking shirtless math, shirtless science,

993
00:59:59,920 --> 01:00:01,640
shirtless English.

994
01:00:01,640 --> 01:00:03,600
The intention of studying law.

995
01:00:03,600 --> 01:00:07,080
By the time he had graduated from high school, he was 8 foot 4.

996
01:00:07,080 --> 01:00:08,360
thirty said that

997
01:00:08,360 --> 01:00:12,420
robert wild low size began to take its toll you required leg braces to walk in

998
01:00:12,420 --> 01:00:14,620
a little feeling in his legs and feet

999
01:00:14,620 --> 01:00:16,780
uh... despite these difficulties

1000
01:00:16,780 --> 01:00:19,320
while they never used a wheelchair

1001
01:00:19,320 --> 01:00:21,320
according to the guinness world records

1002
01:00:21,320 --> 01:00:22,960
he was a u_s_ size thirty

1003
01:00:22,960 --> 01:00:24,360
seven shoe

1004
01:00:24,360 --> 01:00:27,840
a u_k_ thirty six and a european size thirty one

1005
01:00:27,840 --> 01:00:30,600
it's incredible height and weight

1006
01:00:30,600 --> 01:00:34,960
yet the is what was the biggest three feet tall yet the difference is that

1007
01:00:34,960 --> 01:00:37,260
this is a you know

1008
01:00:37,260 --> 01:00:40,960
roberts incredible height weight proves that he could not have possibly be

1009
01:00:40,960 --> 01:00:42,760
possibly been a human

1010
01:00:42,760 --> 01:00:45,880
but more like a walking empire state

1011
01:00:45,880 --> 01:00:47,440
that's good

1012
01:00:47,440 --> 01:00:51,200
carabinier on the street scenario we asked people who did so i are state

1013
01:00:51,200 --> 01:00:53,920
building is in their own rubber like ninety-four

1014
01:00:53,920 --> 01:00:57,800
yet uh... one trillion miles and he looks at the cameras

1015
