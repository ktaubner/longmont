Uh, well you're here to see us, so let's make some noise for a podcast about this!

6
00:00:18,220 --> 00:00:20,220
[cheering]

7
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:22,220
[clapping]

8
00:00:22,220 --> 00:00:23,220
[cheering]

9
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:25,220
Keep walking, keep clapping, Jesus Christ!

10
00:00:25,220 --> 00:00:27,220
[cheering]

11
00:00:27,220 --> 00:00:29,220
[clapping]

12
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:32,220
Thank you, thank you, thank you guys.

13
00:00:32,220 --> 00:00:35,220
What the fuck is up? How you guys doing tonight?

14
00:00:35,220 --> 00:00:39,220
Yeah? Is this the most insane night of your life?

15
00:00:39,220 --> 00:00:43,220
Yeah? Is this just topping it off? You've been doing some crazy shit, huh?

16
00:00:43,220 --> 00:00:46,220
Yeah, it's late. You've all been doing shit already.

17
00:00:46,220 --> 00:00:50,220
It's way past my fucking bedtime. It's 10pm almost. Jesus Christ.

18
00:00:50,220 --> 00:00:52,220
It might be past 10pm.

19
00:00:52,220 --> 00:00:54,220
I don't even know what fucking time it is.

20
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:59,220
So I wanted to mention real quick, with the first show, before hand, we started playing

21
00:00:59,220 --> 00:01:02,620
jump around on loop for an hour and a half.

22
00:01:02,620 --> 00:01:06,220
Nobody noticed or thought it was funny, so that was lucky.

23
00:01:06,220 --> 00:01:13,220
But then, I guess, in our wake as we left to go downstairs to smoke a cigarette,

24
00:01:13,220 --> 00:01:20,220
somebody in this bar turned on "Drink Kanye" playlist.

25
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:22,220
Which, hey, made a respect.

26
00:01:22,220 --> 00:01:23,220
Big step up.

27
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:24,220
Yeah, big step for you guys.

28
00:01:24,220 --> 00:01:27,220
You guys seem to not notice or care also.

29
00:01:27,220 --> 00:01:29,220
So maybe you should have gone back to jump around.

30
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:32,220
You know, which would have made me laugh more.

31
00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:34,220
Probably only you.

32
00:01:34,220 --> 00:01:38,220
Oh wait, alright, thank fucking Christ that that's a different shirt.

33
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:43,220
We were sure you and him had the same shirt on.

34
00:01:43,220 --> 00:01:45,220
These stupid guys walked over here and they saw a red font.

35
00:01:45,220 --> 00:01:48,220
They were like, "This guy's wearing the same shirt as you, Cameron."

36
00:01:48,220 --> 00:01:50,220
And we almost blamed them.

37
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:54,860
different I was like we have to go buy Cameron a shirt yeah we almost did how

38
00:01:54,860 --> 00:02:03,220
embarrassing is that I would get you confused yeah we were gonna do that

39
00:02:03,220 --> 00:02:05,220
I'm like 50 minutes about that right now.

40
00:02:05,220 --> 00:02:09,220
So we're in big trouble.

41
00:02:09,220 --> 00:02:11,220
This sucks. You guys are getting the loose show.

42
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:15,220
The first one, you know, is all scripted, it's all very tight.

43
00:02:15,220 --> 00:02:17,220
We're fucking out here.

44
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:19,220
Is anybody...

45
00:02:19,220 --> 00:02:21,220
Get your foot off the mixer.

46
00:02:21,220 --> 00:02:23,220
Is anybody coming from out of town?

47
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:25,220
Just one person?

48
00:02:25,220 --> 00:02:27,220
From Michigan.

49
00:02:27,220 --> 00:02:29,220
Are you bloat?

50
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:31,220
I heard a woo over there.

51
00:02:31,220 --> 00:02:35,060
Michigan, huh? All for this or for something real?

52
00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:38,580
Yeah, I need an alibi.

00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:44,980
Oh, this is good. This is great. I love that they arrange these seats because I feel like

00:02:56,900 --> 00:03:00,340

69
00:03:55,460 --> 00:04:03,700
I also don't know that like if I traveled that far to kill some podcasters, I might not wait for the late show.

70
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:12,500
Good point. I will say, if anyone was gonna kill us, last show, guy came from fucking London, dude.

Oh, that guy was great. I loved that guy.

00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:18,100
He was great, but, but, uh...

74
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:20,500
What the fuck is wrong with you, man?

75
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:21,860
He was here for a work thing, he explained it.

76
00:04:21,860 --> 00:04:25,860
That's an excuse man, you know. Come on baby.

77
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:27,860
You know, he's here for this outfit dude.

78
00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:29,860
Did anybody even notice how good I look?

79
00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:31,860
[Cheering]

80
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:33,860
That's right. That's fucking right dude.

81
00:04:33,860 --> 00:04:35,860
Do you guys see these scrubs?

82
00:04:35,860 --> 00:04:37,860
Who would ever have a dressing room with nines?

83
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:39,860
These two.

84
00:04:39,860 --> 00:04:41,860
You're a nurse? No, I was calling you a scrub.

85
00:04:41,860 --> 00:04:43,860
[Laughter]

86
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:45,860
Wearing those as scrubs to like,

87
00:04:45,860 --> 00:04:47,860
[Laughter]

88
00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:49,860
I'll be taking care of your father this, uh,

89
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:54,460
You're about to get fucking put under for surgery and you just see a backwoods rick and morty

90
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:55,460
with a hoodie on.

91
00:04:55,460 --> 00:04:58,060
You see it like the last thing you ever see.

92
00:04:58,060 --> 00:05:03,260
The last thing you ever see is Morty in a fucking Nike bucket hat.

93
00:05:03,260 --> 00:05:04,260
It's a cool hoodie.

94
00:05:04,260 --> 00:05:08,060
And he's wearing, I didn't even notice that, he's wearing a fucking NASA hoodie.

95
00:05:08,060 --> 00:05:10,660
It became cool at some point.

96
00:05:10,660 --> 00:05:12,660
Yeah, why the fuck did that happen?

97
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:13,660
Why is NASA cool?

98
00:05:13,660 --> 00:05:18,980
Why did NASA make, it was like a Korean NASA hoodie was sold at every Marshalls in America

99
00:05:18,980 --> 00:05:23,060
for like three years. Yeah. And every like stupid guy you knew

100
00:05:23,060 --> 00:05:28,100
had one. Yeah. What was it like free? I mean, it's like, you

101
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:33,740
get it you get it when you try out. It's like it's like brands

102
00:05:33,740 --> 00:05:35,660
for people who don't know brands, right? They don't know

103
00:05:35,660 --> 00:05:38,700
who's using it. Oh, I know NASA. That was the expensive.

104
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:42,660
Yeah, they made that shit with space bar.

105
00:05:42,660 --> 00:05:44,340
USPS church.

106
00:05:44,340 --> 00:05:45,980
Limited edition.

107
00:05:46,980 --> 00:05:51,540
They did do. What fucking brand was it? I think it was Forever 21.

108
00:05:51,540 --> 00:05:52,580
Did like a USPS.

109
00:05:52,580 --> 00:05:54,420
You really up to date on Forever 21?

110
00:05:54,420 --> 00:05:56,740
I'm up to date on the USPS.

111
00:05:56,740 --> 00:06:03,620
I think they did a... I don't know.

112
00:06:03,620 --> 00:06:05,300
What did they do? What did you think they did?

113
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:08,020
It was a crop top? Thank you for knowing that.

114
00:06:08,020 --> 00:06:11,540
What are the odds we have two Forever 21 experts with the same speed of each other?

115
00:06:11,540 --> 00:06:13,540
How like incredible is that?

116
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:15,220
That's pretty rare, right?

117
00:06:15,220 --> 00:06:15,720
Yeah.

118
00:06:16,260 --> 00:06:19,860
We should do a collab with a brand. What brand would you guys like to see us collab with?

119
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:20,660
Trojan!

120
00:06:20,660 --> 00:06:21,660
Trojan?

121
00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:22,660
Oh!

122
00:06:22,660 --> 00:06:23,860
That'd be pretty good.

123
00:06:23,860 --> 00:06:24,860
Not a bad idea.

124
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:27,860
Yeah, just like an extra extra small condom.

125
00:06:27,860 --> 00:06:29,860
That's what you want us to do?

126
00:06:29,860 --> 00:06:33,860
A podcast about Liz's condom for men with baby penises.

127
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:36,860
I can see it now with like a...

128
00:06:36,860 --> 00:06:37,860
I can imagine the...

129
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:39,860
The clear packaging.

130
00:06:39,860 --> 00:06:42,860
Just to fucking insult injury.

131
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:45,860
Yeah, so you pull it out and the person's like,

132
00:06:45,860 --> 00:06:50,660
Yeah, okay. You got a clear one. It's pretty fucking sweet.

133
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:52,760
You're about to like give me like a rectal exam.

134
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:52,960
Is it?

135
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:55,060
Your finger.

136
00:06:55,060 --> 00:06:58,860
And here's the thing, right? It has a little button inside the

137
00:06:58,860 --> 00:07:01,360
packaging. If it falls out of your wallet in public, that's

138
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:02,260
an alarms going on.

139
00:07:02,260 --> 00:07:09,760
Sorry, I dropped my condom.

140
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:11,560
Yeah, it'll also go off and you're trying to take out your

141
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:12,660
wallet to tap your Charlie.

142
00:07:15,460 --> 00:07:17,460
person's like, what the fuck is happening? You don't understand.

143
00:07:17,460 --> 00:07:18,780
It's just podcast. It's called

144
00:07:18,780 --> 00:07:22,540
I'm sorry, we'll start from there.

145
00:07:22,540 --> 00:07:25,700
You don't get it. It's an all over print condom.

146
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:30,780
You think there's people that collect condoms? People collect

147
00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:31,660
fucking everything.

148
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:34,740
I think there's probably like biggest players in the world.

149
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:36,220
Oh, yeah.

150
00:07:36,220 --> 00:07:37,820
You may never use them.

151
00:07:37,820 --> 00:07:41,660
I should mention this. I don't know. I haven't said this on the

152
00:07:41,660 --> 00:07:45,140
podcast. Anybody ever seen that video that I made where I eat a

153
00:07:45,140 --> 00:07:56,640
condom. It's not important, but I just wanted to make sure that somebody was seeing it. So I got a phone call from my mom about three days ago, and it was never a good sign.

154
00:07:56,640 --> 00:08:13,140
It's always like a relative died or I have to give her money or some shit. So I was like, this is, I'm already preparing for the worst, but it was worse than I could ever imagine. She answered the phone, or I answered the phone, and she's like, "Hey, how you doing?" I was like, "Good." She's like, "Did you eat a condom in my car?"

155
00:08:13,140 --> 00:08:21,780
and put it on the internet under your name and I was like you know fucking paying the

156
00:08:21,780 --> 00:08:24,260
bills bitch

157
00:08:24,260 --> 00:08:29,820
to be clear you did not for people who haven't seen it you didn't eat a condom

158
00:08:29,820 --> 00:08:35,220
I did spit it out at the end. I was at a South prison recorder and I spit the cum out of my mouth

159
00:08:35,220 --> 00:08:40,820
you ate like yogurt out of a condom in your boss car. As far as you know.

160
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:44,820
I'm a man of many talents, you know. I can turn off my taste buds at will.

161
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:48,820
I like that they're concerned too, isn't it? Like, oh, people are going to see you eating a condom.

162
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:52,820
It's like, people are going to see you eating a condom in my car.

163
00:08:52,820 --> 00:08:54,820
They're going to know that it's my car.

164
00:08:54,820 --> 00:08:56,820
Oh fuck, that's Miss Spitz's car.

165
00:08:56,820 --> 00:09:04,820
That was also the worst part was that I found out in that moment that if you Google my name, that's the first thing that comes to mind.

166
00:09:04,820 --> 00:09:07,080
(laughing)

167
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:08,080
They Googled my name,

168
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:10,480
it's me drinking the cum out of a paper bowl.

169
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:12,200
(laughing)

170
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:15,200
And I just sat in my car and was like,

171
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:17,560
why didn't I just fucking become a mechanic, bro?

172
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:20,000
What the fuck am I doing, dude?

173
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,120
What is wrong with me?

174
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:21,960
- Yeah.

175
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:22,800
- Oh my God.

176
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:24,160
I don't know, dude.

177
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:27,200
But I guess that's also not even the most embarrassing

178
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,040
thing I've done.

179
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:28,860
- Yeah.

180
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:30,500
- Which is also another realization where I was like,

181
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:32,760
this is getting increasingly worse every year.

182
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:33,600
- Yeah, you're gonna--

183
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:34,440
(laughing)

184
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:36,440
I'm gonna keep getting calls from your f*cking mom.

185
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:38,440
Yeah, I'm gonna keep getting calls from my mom.

186
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:41,440
She's like, "The Secret Service is at my f*cking house."

187
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:45,440
That didn't happen.

188
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:48,440
Weren't you telling us about some plan to like,

189
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:53,440
download every New York police officer's phone number onto your computer?

190
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:56,440
Can't talk about it yet, but yeah.

191
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:58,440
Don't speak about that!

192
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:01,440
Yeah, that's my man. That's my lawyer in the back.

193
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:03,440
I bring him everywhere I go.

194
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:06,440
You gotta do it now, you gotta have a murder.

195
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:11,440
No, I had an idea to send every federal employee in the United States the same photo.

196
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:15,440
But I was like, they'll probably think that's like a terrorist act.

197
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:21,440
Because it's just gonna be a photo of Bill Dance, the professional fisher.

198
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:24,440
And then I talked to somebody and I was like,

199
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:28,440
is there like a database of every federal employee's email?

200
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:31,440
And they're like, no.

201
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:33,440
Probably good that there isn't.

202
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:37,440
Yeah, they're like trying to stop freaks like you from doing this shit.

203
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:40,440
So yeah, that's another one of my plans foiled.

204
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:44,440
At this point I'm almost used to it, so whatever.

205
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:50,440
I mean, if it sucks when a dastardly scheme gets foiled, I hate it.

206
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:53,440
Yeah, it was pretty fucked up, man.

207
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:55,440
Did you say curses?

208
00:10:55,440 --> 00:11:00,440
I did say, I looked at the sky, I said, "Ahh, curses!"

209
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:05,440
I twirled my mustache and then I untied Patrick from a train track.

210
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:08,440
He looked so beautiful.

211
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:11,440
He was so gorgeous. I dressed him up like a girl. I put him on a train track.

212
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:14,440
I looked good. I looked fucking awesome.

213
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:17,440
Don't tell people he was serving.

214
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:18,440
He was serving.

215
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:22,440
I was serving. And it was a slay.

216
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:25,440
We're going to be slaying.

217
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:27,440
Can you say that?

218
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:29,440
I don't think I'm allowed to.

219
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:37,440
So we have Tennessee, we have Worcester, you said you're somewhere in Mass, right?

220
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:40,440
No London, huh? No London.

221
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:42,440
Alright, it's disappointing.

222
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:47,440
I was hoping we'd get something further than London. I mean, that's not too much to ask for, right?

223
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:50,440
I guess China or Australia would have been funny.

224
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:54,440
Yeah, like a real wild card, like the Vatican or something.

225
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:58,440
The Pope shows up, "Where are you from?" "Vatican City."

226
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:00,440
"Why is he a robot?"

227
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:04,440
"What the fuck was that accent?"

228
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:08,440
I couldn't remember if he's from Italy or somewhere else.

229
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:10,440
So, robot is funny.

230
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:12,440
He's not from the Vatican!

231
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:14,440
The Pope is a boy in the Vatican.

232
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:16,440
Do a Vatican accent.

233
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:19,440
[Vatican accent]

234
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:21,440
Something like that?

235
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:22,440
You're Irish Catholic you faker.

236
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:23,440
You don't have any respect for the fucking church.

237
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:24,440
I don't have any respect dude.

238
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:25,440
Have you guys seen that movie Spotlight?

239
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:26,440
That's not talking about it.

240
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:27,440
That's actually a bad road to get down huh?

241
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:28,440
Yeah, we'll skip over that.

242
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:29,440
Those people from Worcester, that's probably a touchy subject.

243
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:30,440
I'm not going to talk about that.

244
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:31,440
I'm not going to talk about that.

245
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:32,440
I'm not going to talk about that.

246
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:33,440
I'm not going to talk about that.

247
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:34,440
I'm not going to talk about that.

248
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:35,440
I'm not going to talk about that.

249
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:36,440
I'm not going to talk about that.

250
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:37,440
I'm not going to talk about that.

251
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:38,440
I'm not going to talk about that.

252
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:39,440
I'm not going to talk about that.

253
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:40,440
I'm not going to talk about that.

254
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:43,440
That's actually a bad way to get down, huh?

255
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:45,440
Yeah, we'll skip over that.

256
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:48,440
Those people from Worcester, that's probably a touch of subject.

257
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:57,440
Told you it was a police show, boys.

258
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:59,440
You know, we're fucking around now.

259
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:00,440
Oh boy.

260
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:01,440
Yeah.

261
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:02,440
Oh boy, oh boy.

262
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:03,440
Are you here just for tonight?

263
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:05,440
No, we're here for a few more days.

264
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:06,440
Okay, cool.

265
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:09,440
Are you following us around the next couple days?

266
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:11,440
Is that the plan?

267
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:13,440
We got something else to do.

268
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:17,440
I'm pretty easy to stick a bug on. I got a lot of smooth surfaces on me.

269
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:19,440
If you need to, go ahead.

270
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:21,440
He's got velcro.

271
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:24,440
Yeah, so this sweatshirt, he just got this sweatshirt.

272
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:26,440
It's like...

273
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:30,440
His head is like peeling the lint off.

274
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:32,440
Like, it...

275
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:34,440
Hold this.

276
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:36,440
I'm gonna fucking case him more.

277
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:38,440
Don't just laugh at my bald head!

278
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:40,440
What the hell is that?

279
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:42,440
He pulled the...

280
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:44,440
He pulled the parachute over his head

281
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:46,440
and this like pink fuzz was like...

282
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:48,440
Yeah, let's see.

283
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:50,440
Pull it off. Somebody pull it off and show the people.

284
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:54,440
It's like you're sweating too much.

285
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:56,440
It's like coagulated.

286
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:58,440
It's like digging into your head.

287
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:00,440
Actually, it looks like you've got a little bit of hair.

288
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:02,440
Are you serious?

289
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:04,440
Oh my god.

290
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:06,440
Oh shit!

291
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:08,440
Oh my gosh!

292
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:12,440
Yeah, you guys can't see this, but it looks amazing!

293
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:14,440
Oh my gosh!

294
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:16,440
It's like my hair is back again.

295
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:18,440
You look like Ian McKellen right now.

296
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:20,440
Are you serious?

297
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:22,440
You look way older.

298
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:24,440
Doesn't it look gay?

299
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:26,440
No? Oh, okay.

300
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:28,440
You look like Magneto.

301
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:30,440
I don't know if that's different.

302
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:32,440
Nice.

303
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:34,440
Do you want that back?

304
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:40,920
$20 for it three hours ago. We went to we stopped at the Newberry comics at Faneuil Hall before the

305
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:47,240
show because because he had this he had this he was missing something he had nothing on his head.

306
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:52,040
I don't know what to tell you man I I you know I I will say this is I I have two of these.

307
00:14:52,040 --> 00:15:01,800
I mean there's a second one. Just just imagine the the fear in those Newberry comics employees

308
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:04,620
his heart's when they see you walking in and those pants and that sweatshirt they

309
00:15:04,620 --> 00:15:10,460
know exactly where you are. Where's the hat? Where's the fucking hat?

310
00:15:10,460 --> 00:15:14,460
You see the bald head? It's like a target.

311
00:15:14,460 --> 00:15:20,460
They think I just got my hair incinerated.

312
00:15:20,460 --> 00:15:24,460
And I'm naked cover it with something. Please tell me you have a Rick and Morty hat.

313
00:15:24,460 --> 00:15:27,460
Please for the love of... I will not take anything else.

314
00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:32,460
No, I won't take the fucking Outworlders or whatever that other fucking Rick and Morty is.

315
00:15:32,460 --> 00:15:34,460
I need Rick and Morty.

316
00:15:34,460 --> 00:15:36,460
I didn't know there was another...

317
00:15:36,460 --> 00:15:38,460
They made a new one, dude.

318
00:15:38,460 --> 00:15:41,460
It's about like... it sucks.

319
00:15:41,460 --> 00:15:43,460
It sucks dick, yeah.

320
00:15:43,460 --> 00:15:45,460
It's probably... yeah, I've heard of it.

321
00:15:45,460 --> 00:15:47,460
It's nothing like Rick and Morty.

322
00:15:47,460 --> 00:15:52,460
I actually do like Rick and Morty, though. That's the most embarrassing part.

323
00:15:52,460 --> 00:15:56,460
I opened up this hoodie that I bought from basicallywish.com

324
00:15:56,460 --> 00:16:00,460
I opened it up and I was like, "It's kinda sick."

325
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:04,460
"And I got the magic pants shit!"

326
00:16:04,460 --> 00:16:07,460
"This is sick, dude."

327
00:16:07,460 --> 00:16:11,460
I know you're just gonna pick up a Zoom call and just be wearing that.

328
00:16:11,460 --> 00:16:14,460
Yeah, you're not gonna take that off for like a week.

329
00:16:14,460 --> 00:16:17,460
When the Secret Service finally knocks on my door, they're gonna be like...

330
00:16:17,460 --> 00:16:20,460
I answer the door, "Hello?" Full Rick and Morty.

331
00:16:20,460 --> 00:16:23,460
They're not even gonna question you, just arrest you.

332
00:16:23,460 --> 00:16:27,460
You have to go to prison, you have to go to hell actually. We're just going to be prison with you.

333
00:16:27,460 --> 00:16:30,460
We're going straight to hell. This is so fucked up.

334
00:16:30,460 --> 00:16:35,460
Alright, you guys want to fucking do the list?

335
00:16:35,460 --> 00:16:38,460
I don't know this, can we hear the rest of this Jan Kohl song?

336
00:16:38,460 --> 00:16:41,460
[laughter]

337
00:16:41,460 --> 00:16:45,460
Wait, this song is called Big Sean Drake, J. Cole, Kendrick Lamar. I love this song.

338
00:16:45,460 --> 00:16:47,460
[laughter]

339
00:16:47,460 --> 00:16:50,460
It's like my favorite song. If only I knew who made it.

340
00:16:50,460 --> 00:16:55,200
(laughter)

341
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:56,640
Now we're doing the list? Is that what's happening?

342
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:57,640
Yeah, let's do the list, baby.

343
00:16:57,640 --> 00:16:59,300
Alright, let me see. Which one is this?

344
00:16:59,300 --> 00:17:00,480
Oh yeah, we did two different lists.

345
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:02,480
Me and Pat have not seen any of these, but...

346
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:03,480
Yeah, it's true.

347
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:06,480
We went in blind and it wasn't because we weren't helping out.

348
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:09,480
Yeah, no. It wasn't about your two ways you could find the list.

349
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:11,480
We just wanted to surprise ourselves.

350
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:12,480
Authentic reaction.

351
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:13,980
It was for the show.

352
00:17:13,980 --> 00:17:16,480
It's not because we didn't want to make a fucking PowerPoint.

353
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:19,980
You guys made me do a full 15 minutes of work to find shit.

354
00:17:19,980 --> 00:17:20,980
I'm so sorry.

355
00:17:20,980 --> 00:17:32,180
Out of the two hours I already have to work a week, it's too much.

356
00:17:32,180 --> 00:17:37,220
We got from the top tens dot com, top ten worst things to find in your home.

357
00:17:37,220 --> 00:17:39,700
Imagine coming home and seeing these in your home.

358
00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:41,780
What would be the worst thing to see of all?

359
00:17:41,780 --> 00:17:42,780
Vote for it.

360
00:17:42,780 --> 00:17:45,660
You know this guy, Positron Wildhawk, he comes up quite a bit.

361
00:17:45,660 --> 00:17:46,660
He's very active.

362
00:17:46,660 --> 00:17:47,660
He's one of the super users.

363
00:17:47,660 --> 00:17:51,500
of the super users. I have high, high hopes for this list.

364
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:52,580
It should be good.

365
00:17:52,580 --> 00:17:54,380
Anybody recognize positron wildcard?

366
00:17:54,380 --> 00:17:55,020
Anybody here?

367
00:17:55,020 --> 00:17:57,300
Any positron fans?

368
00:17:57,300 --> 00:17:59,300
Is positron wildcard here?

369
00:17:59,300 --> 00:18:04,620
That's good, dude. You should message him. I wonder if he

370
00:18:04,620 --> 00:18:07,060
knows that he or any other people like this.

371
00:18:07,060 --> 00:18:10,900
I know we have received we received one message. Oh, yeah.

372
00:18:10,900 --> 00:18:12,700
Yeah. I don't know what this is about.

373
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:14,740
No, you're not ready for this.

374
00:18:14,740 --> 00:18:16,740
pointing at each other and having a discovery.

375
00:18:16,740 --> 00:18:18,740
He was at a brain blast.

376
00:18:18,740 --> 00:18:20,740
Yeah, that's crazy.

377
00:18:20,740 --> 00:18:22,740
That was a fucking weird one.

378
00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:24,740
A guy whose lists we've read on the show before

379
00:18:24,740 --> 00:18:26,740
whose lists are all

380
00:18:26,740 --> 00:18:28,740
disgusting cartoon character fetish stuff.

381
00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:30,740
Yeah, it's like he's obsessed with

382
00:18:30,740 --> 00:18:32,740
inflation.

383
00:18:32,740 --> 00:18:34,740
Like inflating Bugs Bunny.

384
00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:36,740
Oh, I mean, okay, so there's that.

385
00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:38,740
But also, he has the more advanced ones

386
00:18:38,740 --> 00:18:40,740
which are like, "I want to go inside

387
00:18:40,740 --> 00:18:42,740
of Yosemite Sam's brain and come in there."

388
00:18:42,740 --> 00:18:47,900
in there. Yeah. He's got shit like that. It's nuts. He I forget

389
00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:50,120
what he fucking said to us. We've read his list maybe twice

390
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:52,460
on the show. He just messaged the podcast account out of

391
00:18:52,460 --> 00:18:55,100
nowhere just started talking to us. It's a scary shit. Yeah.

392
00:18:55,100 --> 00:18:58,260
He was giving us lists. He was giving us like, Oh,

393
00:18:58,260 --> 00:19:03,060
yeah, he was giving us shit. He was like, Yeah, no read this

394
00:19:03,060 --> 00:19:07,180
one. Read that. No, I don't want to fucking read your inflation

395
00:19:07,180 --> 00:19:08,660
fucking destroy little bunny.

396
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:14,180
This one's insane, I'd get in your fucking kidneys dude, it's so hot.

397
00:19:14,180 --> 00:19:18,980
Yeah, well, I mean, I don't know, maybe we should get him up.

398
00:19:18,980 --> 00:19:20,500
Who knows?

399
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:24,180
Now that I know that he enjoys having the list read, we're never doing it again.

400
00:19:24,180 --> 00:19:25,980
Yeah, yeah, dude, that's a huge mistake.

401
00:19:25,980 --> 00:19:28,140
That's a huge fucking mistake.

402
00:19:28,140 --> 00:19:29,980
Alright, number one, you guys have any guesses?

403
00:19:29,980 --> 00:19:31,580
Top 10 worst things to find in your home?

404
00:19:31,580 --> 00:19:33,100
Maybe a fucking pile of crap.

405
00:19:33,100 --> 00:19:35,180
You're pretty shit.

406
00:19:35,180 --> 00:19:36,380
Yeah.

407
00:19:36,380 --> 00:19:36,980
Good.

408
00:19:36,980 --> 00:19:37,580
A small boy.

409
00:19:37,580 --> 00:19:38,100
What?!

410
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:41,100
(laughter)

411
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:43,100
That's number one!

412
00:19:43,100 --> 00:19:46,100
You have to admit, it'd be pretty bad.

413
00:19:46,100 --> 00:19:49,100
I guess so. How small are we talking, though?

414
00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:52,100
How small can a black hole... do we have an astrophysicist in the audience?

415
00:19:52,100 --> 00:19:56,100
A black hole could be as small as a pinprick or as large as an entire universe.

416
00:19:56,100 --> 00:19:57,100
Wow.

417
00:19:57,100 --> 00:20:00,100
Do we actually... oh, wait, hey, what's up?

418
00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:01,100
(laughter)

419
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:04,100
Could you? Could you have a small black hole?

420
00:20:04,100 --> 00:20:10,580
I mean, technically you could have like, enough mass in a small area to have like, yeah, a pinprick.

421
00:20:10,580 --> 00:20:11,080
What?

422
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:13,640
I was like, "I'm the smartest person in the world?

423
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:16,740
What? Why are you here?

424
00:20:16,740 --> 00:20:18,860
Am I in trouble?

425
00:20:18,860 --> 00:20:20,460
What the fuck is happening?

426
00:20:20,460 --> 00:20:22,940
Am I in a scientist show or something?

427
00:20:22,940 --> 00:20:25,960
Am I like, am I getting an F right now?

428
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:28,560
I don't know what to do."

429
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:31,680
You know what? I'm gonna be completely honest.

430
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:37,200
when I first read that I just thought it meant just like a hole in the ground

431
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:39,200
Like a Looney Tunes hole?

432
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:41,200
Yeah exactly

433
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:43,200
Like a big slap on the ground?

434
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:45,200
Yeah you fall into it or whatever it's probably annoying to fall down into it

435
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:47,200
That would suck

436
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:49,200
Yeah

437
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:51,200
First comment here

438
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:53,200
I had a small black hole

439
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:55,200
We didn't even need you to answer

440
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:57,200
This guy's first hand experience

441
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:59,200
It was called an ex spouse

442
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:01,200
I know all you divorcees can relate

443
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:03,200
Who is on this website divorced?

444
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:05,200
Everyone!

445
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:07,200
Alright, you know what? I've been proven wrong.

446
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:12,200
Okay, so they're calling their spouse...

447
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:14,200
A small black hole.

448
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:17,200
Which is, I guess, more insulting than a large black hole, maybe?

449
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:18,200
I don't know. I can't tell.

450
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:20,200
You need to stick with the classics, bitch.

451
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:21,200
That's like, super fun.

452
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:23,200
It's like, Subrotney Dangerfield stuff.

453
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:26,200
Just go fucking Anthony Jess with a car.

454
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:28,200
Just you, bitch. Fuck you.

455
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:32,200
Don't call black black hole is too, that's a step too far, that's beyond the pale.

456
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:34,200
Yeah, but it could be racist, I don't know.

457
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:37,200
You know, I didn't even think about that, but it's so not racist.

458
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:39,200
[Laughter]

459
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:41,200
Yeah, you got it yourself, my friend.

460
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:47,200
I think any insult that you like would maybe possibly have to explain is like very bad, you shouldn't say that to somebody.

461
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:53,200
Would you as an astrophysicist call, which I just, I don't know if you even are, I just kind of assume.

462
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:55,200
Did you, because you knew one thing about black holes.

463
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:57,200
[Laughter]

464
00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:01,920
Would you call somebody that you hated a small black hole or is that like too rude?

465
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:03,920
Is that like fucked up?

466
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:07,920
I think like, it's not, I feel like it's too Reddit a thing to call somebody that.

467
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:11,920
Wow, that's a strong, you are an astrophysicist.

468
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:13,920
That's very strong.

469
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:15,920
That is far too Reddit, I agree.

470
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:17,920
Yeah.

471
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:19,920
I mean that is the worst insult to an astrophysicist.

472
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:21,920
Yeah, do it. Around the office.

473
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:23,920
I bet you have a lot of good quotes about that.

474
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:25,920
One or two calls to HR.

475
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:30,480
yeah he called me a quasar

476
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:38,400
this will destroy you and your house before you can say death selfie

477
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:41,600
thank fucking god

478
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:47,520
that's i mean that's a phrase that's a phrase nobody should ever have

479
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:52,000
yeah i mean please i mean take let me who's the last person to say jake paul

480
00:22:52,000 --> 00:23:03,480
probably. Come on, man. We did get really into it again. I think the other night, you and

481
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:07,480
me especially have like a brain that is like a year and a half, like 18 months behind every

482
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:12,520
pop culture event. Yeah, we'll talk about like, like, we talked about like Carole Baskin.

483
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:13,600
Like,

484
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:21,840
a month ago. Yeah, it's true. I think I had a dissonance. Why do you listen to this? Jesus

485
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:26,520
Once you're in, you can't get out.

486
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:27,520
That's what she said.

487
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:28,520
God damn, dude.

488
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:29,520
Llama Boy's just thinking rationally.

489
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:30,520
A cheese 5.67 had to fuckin'-- he's too goddamn--

490
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:31,520
Whoa!

491
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:32,520
Oh, shit!

492
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:33,520
Yo!

493
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:34,520
Yeah!

494
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:35,520
You did buy him the beer!

495
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:36,520
That wasn't me!

496
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:37,520
That wasn't you?

497
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:38,520
Who bought him that?

498
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:39,520
Why'd you blow it?

499
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:40,520
Oh my god, dude.

500
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:41,520
No, it was me!

501
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:42,520
It was--

502
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:43,520
Oh, yeah!

503
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:44,520
Yeah!

504
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:45,520
Yeah!

505
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:46,520
Yeah!

506
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:47,520
Yeah!

507
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:48,520
Yeah!

508
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:49,520
Yeah!

509
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:50,520
Yeah!

510
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:51,520
Yeah!

511
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:53,520
I feel like I'm gonna pour this on my head now.

512
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:55,520
[laughter]

513
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:57,520
That's how you get flowing locks, dude.

514
00:23:57,520 --> 00:23:59,520
Yeah, that's a good idea.

515
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:01,520
You get the foam on you, dude?

516
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:03,520
Yeah, shampoo that shit out.

517
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:05,520
Do you also do hair in addition to space?

518
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:07,520
Can you figure something out with my fucking head?

519
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:09,520
[laughter]

520
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:11,520
More like any chance?

521
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:13,520
You're kind of thinking about it, though.

522
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:15,520
[laughter]

523
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:17,520
I thought it was gonna be a hard no.

524
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:19,520
Um, G557, I just feel like it's kind of rude.

525
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:26,000
like it's kind of rude. It doesn't make a lot of sense. Once you're in, you can't get out.

526
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:33,560
I don't think she said that. You can get out pretty easily. I hope. That's a good point.

527
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:37,080
Yeah, I think that's a I think that's I think she's five six seven I think this

528
00:24:37,080 --> 00:24:39,880
should be banned from the website. Yeah, I agree.

529
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:46,400
Number two Satan. Oh shit. I'm just so fucking pissed. Oh my god. Long day of work, right?

530
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:49,740
I know you fucking put your key in the door open it up

531
00:24:49,740 --> 00:25:01,360
Save from the end of the tenacious d-movie is fucking sitting here talking and you know, we'd be talking shit. Oh

532
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:10,280
It's there he's gonna be cursing you out. Yes. Yeah, just say my mom's in the other room and if she hears you

533
00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:12,280
I'm gonna be trouble

534
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:19,040
sleeping bag Satan I'm not allowed that friends over on weekend I fucking hope

535
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:22,000
you're not sleeping over you better not be sleep walking better not getting the

536
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:26,160
wrong idea dude you're fucking poke holes in my sleeping bag with your horns

537
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:28,960
if you wake me up laughing at 3am I'm gonna soak this house in

538
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:32,360
you know Satan's gonna prank you if you fall asleep at his house yeah you know

539
00:25:32,360 --> 00:25:35,960
he's gonna put hot sauce in your toothbrush oh my god put your hand in

540
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:39,280
warm water you're gonna pee the bed he can probably just make you pee the bed

541
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:39,780
Yeah.

542
00:25:39,780 --> 00:25:41,780
You might even fucking fuck your face.

543
00:25:41,780 --> 00:25:42,280
Yeah.

544
00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:43,280
[laughter]

545
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:44,780
Now that I think about it, it's pretty evil.

546
00:25:44,780 --> 00:25:45,280
Yeah.

547
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:47,280
I think that might be one of the most evil things.

548
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:49,280
You might as well just fuck your face to death instead.

549
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:49,780
Yeah.

550
00:25:49,780 --> 00:25:53,780
If Satan shows up to the sleepover, you know everybody's picking truth.

551
00:25:53,780 --> 00:25:54,280
The whole...

552
00:25:54,280 --> 00:26:02,280
[laughter]

553
00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:03,280
Yeah, I hear you.

554
00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:05,280
You're not going to consign your soul to anything.

555
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:07,280
[laughter]

556
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:10,640
No fucking shots, Satan. No way, dude.

557
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:11,600
Don't do it, true.

558
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:12,100
Yeah.

559
00:26:12,100 --> 00:26:12,900
Yeah.

560
00:26:12,900 --> 00:26:14,680
First kiss is Monaco, okay?

561
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:18,080
Stop trying to make me fucking...

562
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:21,040
Oh, fuck.

563
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:24,880
Time to move out and probably burn down the house while you leave.

564
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:25,280
Satan is in here.

565
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:26,800
He's made of fire!

566
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:28,160
He would probably love that crap.

567
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:29,280
Yeah!

568
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:32,400
He burned down the house with Satan in it and he's fucking...

569
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:33,040
Can we chill?

570
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:33,760
He's chilling.

571
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:34,260
Yeah.

572
00:26:34,260 --> 00:26:37,120
You know what? No, it's probably reverse psychology.

573
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:39,120
He probably wants you to do that.

574
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:40,120
True.

575
00:26:40,120 --> 00:26:42,120
Even my spirit might be saved.

576
00:26:42,120 --> 00:26:43,120
You mean?

577
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:44,120
Yeah, it does.

578
00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:45,120
I mean, he is a ghost.

579
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:48,120
I'm sorry, I kind of frightened myself when I said that.

580
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:51,120
My heart kind of skipped a beat.

581
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:52,120
Um, um, um.

582
00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:53,120
You can't.

583
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:54,120
Okay, okay.

584
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:55,120
You really can't.

585
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:56,120
Fuck.

586
00:26:56,120 --> 00:26:59,120
I only invite Lord Jesus and God and only Father.

587
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:02,120
The devil shall go nowhere near my humble prayer and faith.

588
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:05,120
Why would you rather see the devil than just John Bieber?

589
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:10,120
That is just strange. Messed up! God bless you all and keep you safe. Emma XX

590
00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:15,120
Thank you Emma. I mean, respect. That's all I gotta say about this.

591
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:17,120
Thank you so much Emma. It's beautiful.

592
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:19,120
It has us on block, dude. Yeah.

593
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:24,120
I mean, I didn't know I wouldn't be able to say some shit like this to protect myself.

594
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:25,120
Yeah. It's lucky we have you.

595
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:28,120
I remember when I was a kid, my parents were like super Christian.

596
00:27:28,120 --> 00:27:31,120
And we moved around a lot, if you could believe it.

597
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:35,920
But I remember every time we moved into a new house, my mom was like, "We have to anoint

598
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:36,920
the house with oil."

599
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:41,520
And they would take olive oil and just put like a little, not even a cross, like a plus

600
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:42,520
sign over every door.

601
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:47,040
And then me and my brother were like, "You know what, there's a big difference between

602
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:48,040
a plus sign and a cross."

603
00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:49,040
You move the middle finger.

604
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:50,040
There's a decent difference.

605
00:27:50,040 --> 00:27:51,040
Again, Irish Catholic?

606
00:27:51,040 --> 00:27:52,040
Yeah.

607
00:27:52,040 --> 00:27:53,040
Who?

608
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:54,040
Who?

609
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:55,040
I'm fucking barely went.

610
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:56,040
What's wrong with you?

611
00:27:56,040 --> 00:27:57,040
I wasn't allowed in church.

612
00:27:57,040 --> 00:27:58,040
I was too loud.

613
00:27:58,040 --> 00:27:59,040
Anyway, I went and went.

614
00:27:59,040 --> 00:28:00,040
Anyway.

615
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:04,040
My mom didn't fucking let me go.

616
00:28:04,040 --> 00:28:05,040
Damn.

617
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:10,040
When me and my brother, after they do that shit, we were like, "You know what would be really funny?

618
00:28:10,040 --> 00:28:13,040
Fucking wipe the things off the door."

619
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:15,040
And so we did.

620
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:18,040
And we had a bad life.

621
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:22,040
Horrible things happened all the time.

622
00:28:22,040 --> 00:28:24,040
Who fucking knows why.

623
00:28:24,040 --> 00:28:25,040
Yeah, yeah.

624
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:27,040
Trying to turn it upside down.

625
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:27,880
- Yeah, there it is.

626
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:28,720
(laughing)

627
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:30,020
- We'll turn it to a minus.

628
00:28:30,020 --> 00:28:30,860
- Yeah.

629
00:28:30,860 --> 00:28:33,540
- This fuckin', there's a bad move on my part.

630
00:28:33,540 --> 00:28:34,380
- Yeah.

631
00:28:34,380 --> 00:28:35,200
(laughing)

632
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:36,040
- Not smart.

633
00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:37,220
- If Satan came into my apartment,

634
00:28:37,220 --> 00:28:39,720
I would tell everyone to get out or hold up a cross.

635
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:40,560
The cool guy won.

636
00:28:40,560 --> 00:28:41,400
(laughing)

637
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:42,760
- Yeah, that's a pretty fuckin' cool move.

638
00:28:42,760 --> 00:28:44,160
He's trying to help everybody.

639
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:46,840
- Also, I like this, that you could have a username

640
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:47,680
on this website.

641
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:48,520
- Exactly.

642
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:49,340
- Yeah.

643
00:28:49,340 --> 00:28:50,180
- He chose to be anonymous and then sign his comment.

644
00:28:50,180 --> 00:28:51,800
- Not only did he choose to be anonymous

645
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:52,880
and sign his comment,

646
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:54,440
if you're anonymous and sign your comment,

647
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:56,240
it's not like the cool guy is taken.

648
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:58,240
Like you don't have to put the one after it.

649
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:00,240
You can just leave the call.

650
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:04,240
At least it's not the cool guy.

651
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:06,240
He could have just been the cool guy.

652
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:08,240
You don't have to be a bug either.

653
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:10,240
I mean, I feel like he's selling himself a little short.

654
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:12,240
Yeah, come on, cool guy.

655
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:14,240
Number three, Justin Bieber.

656
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:16,240
Oh, hell nah. Uh uh.

657
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:18,240
No way.

658
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:20,240
He walked into my house and he's sitting there in a bikini

659
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:22,240
singing this song.

660
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:24,240
I'd probably piss vomit.

661
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:31,240
I'd probably make him take a picture of me just because it'd make him so mad.

662
00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:32,240
Yeah.

663
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:34,240
You'd make him take a picture of you?

664
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:36,240
Yeah, he'd probably hate that.

665
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:44,240
Jesse, I know you hate this crap. I'm gonna be on my bed, here's a Polaroid, you come in, you take photos, whatever you want.

666
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:47,240
Because I know it'd piss you off because I hate you so much.

667
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:50,240
Yeah, you can put your stupid music on too if you want to.

668
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:55,040
too if you want to. You put a stupid dick in my face and you care that much?

669
00:29:55,040 --> 00:29:59,440
You fucking asshole. Go ahead, yeah, yeah, I better piss you off super hard.

670
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:04,240
Leave a "guy sucked your dick because you're not gay" so they would fucking, you'd probably cry so...

671
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:08,240
Go to hell Justin. Take me down buddy.

672
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:12,240
So we got a long one here. Oh shit, it's a list in the list.

673
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:16,240
Yo, we're giving you guys too much.

674
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:18,240
We pay him double for this.

675
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:20,240
Do you guys wanna like cycle around?

676
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:22,240
Do you wanna do like, you know, I don't wanna do this whole thing.

677
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:24,240
You wanna play popcorn?

678
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:26,240
Yeah I wanna play popcorn.

679
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:28,240
Things to do if J.B. ever comes to your house.

680
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:30,240
1. Get the sledgehammer. Popcorn Caleb?

681
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:32,240
(laughter)

682
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:34,240
2. Hit him in the nuts with the sledgehammer.

683
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:36,240
I'd hate that.

684
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:38,240
3. While he's going down,

685
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:40,240
hit him in the face with the sledgehammer.

686
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:42,240
Yeah.

687
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:44,240
4. Get the rifle.

688
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:49,240
While he's upside down, start shooting him with the gun until you get bored.

689
00:30:49,240 --> 00:30:54,240
I do like the unlimited ammo this person has.

690
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:58,240
It's unlimited until they're bored.

691
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:02,240
It's really kind that they put in that qualifier too, because I would have just kept going.

692
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:04,240
I would have just messed up when I got there.

693
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:07,240
I don't know how I got to number 7. I'm stuck on 6.

694
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:09,240
Threw him off the roof.

695
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:11,240
Put him in the middle of the road.

696
00:31:11,240 --> 00:31:13,240
Start running him over.

697
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:18,520
bombs and two grenades in his mouth. That is what you should do if JB ever comes to your house.

698
00:31:18,520 --> 00:31:24,760
And that's from Golden Rocket. Yeah. This guy has a cath- do you think he has this like in script like

699
00:31:24,760 --> 00:31:29,240
on a big poster in his house that he left him? This is like- In his house, we get the sledgehammer,

700
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:34,440
hit him in the nuts with the sledgehammer. This is like the like the 99 foot, I don't know,

701
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:40,440
fucking Martin Luther. Yeah. He's putting that in front of the fucking church. This guy, this might

702
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:46,440
be the most religious man on earth. He keeps crushing them. Home run after home run when

703
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:51,080
it comes to this god shit. What I like about this is it gradually reveals how many weapons

704
00:31:51,080 --> 00:31:54,760
he has, he expects you to have in your house. Yeah. He starts with a sledgehammer, like

705
00:31:54,760 --> 00:31:58,760
okay maybe. Like a rifle, some people have rifles in defense, and then two bombs and

706
00:31:58,760 --> 00:32:02,760
two grenades. I don't think... I'm gonna have to hit Home Depot if I'm gonna fuck with this

707
00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:04,760
I don't know what to tell you.

708
00:32:04,760 --> 00:32:10,760
He's horrible. I have the ore spawn mod 1.7.10 and I'm absolutely killing him with my royal guardian sword.

709
00:32:10,760 --> 00:32:15,760
P.S. You have to kill the king to get the royal guardian sword, but once you do, it's totally worth it.

710
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:18,760
750+ attack damage. Sure to kill him in one hit.

711
00:32:18,760 --> 00:32:20,760
What fucking game is this?

712
00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:22,760
It's gotta be Minecraft.

713
00:32:22,760 --> 00:32:23,760
Yeah, it's gotta be Minecraft.

714
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:24,760
Ore? Ore spawn?

715
00:32:24,760 --> 00:32:25,760
You know.

716
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:27,760
What is it?

717
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:29,760
It's gotta be Minecraft.

718
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:35,440
Okay, that's what he said dude. You can't copy me. You have a teacher right next to you dude.

719
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:38,240
He's gonna fucking kill you for that shit.

720
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:39,600
Put him in detention. Do it.

721
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:43,200
You're close bud. You're this close to detention.

722
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:44,340
Yeah.

723
00:32:44,340 --> 00:32:46,960
That's a good buff.

724
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:49,280
I'll take that.

725
00:32:49,280 --> 00:32:49,780
Yeah.

726
00:32:49,780 --> 00:32:54,560
I'm a believer, but if he broke into my house or something, I would beat him with my guitar.

727
00:32:54,560 --> 00:32:57,520
But if he got permission from my parents, I guess it'll be cool.

728
00:32:57,520 --> 00:32:58,240
It's good. Yeah.

729
00:32:59,040 --> 00:33:01,040
It's not true about anybody though, right?

730
00:33:01,040 --> 00:33:04,040
Maybe like the most, the most, like, um...

731
00:33:04,040 --> 00:33:08,040
Just the person with the best working brain on this website, I think, maybe.

732
00:33:08,040 --> 00:33:11,040
Like, the most reasonable person that's like, "Yeah, I'm a pro gamer."

733
00:33:11,040 --> 00:33:15,040
Might be the only believer on this entire website.

734
00:33:15,040 --> 00:33:17,040
That's a good point.

735
00:33:17,040 --> 00:33:20,040
This person has suffered long.

736
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:23,040
They've gone through so much.

737
00:33:23,040 --> 00:33:26,040
Number four nuclear weapons.

738
00:33:26,040 --> 00:33:28,040
I'm selling them immediately.

739
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:30,040
That's my second fucking bank.

740
00:33:30,040 --> 00:33:32,040
Oh my god, are you kidding me?

741
00:33:32,040 --> 00:33:34,040
That'd be like two or three hundred bucks a month.

742
00:33:34,040 --> 00:33:36,040
At least.

743
00:33:36,040 --> 00:33:38,040
I feel like that's like a come up.

744
00:33:38,040 --> 00:33:40,040
Nuclear warhead in my house?

745
00:33:40,040 --> 00:33:42,040
Yeah.

746
00:33:42,040 --> 00:33:44,040
I'm going on a crisis.

747
00:33:44,040 --> 00:33:46,040
He's right, there's not a nuclear warhead in my house.

748
00:33:46,040 --> 00:33:48,040
Oh yeah.

749
00:33:48,040 --> 00:33:50,040
Here's a twist. You may ask,

750
00:33:50,040 --> 00:33:52,040
how exactly would this be bad?

751
00:33:52,040 --> 00:33:54,040
Well, no one ever said they weren't about to explode.

752
00:33:54,040 --> 00:33:56,040
True. It's about the things they didn't say.

753
00:33:56,040 --> 00:33:58,040
Fuuuuuck.

754
00:33:58,040 --> 00:34:00,040
It's about the things they left out.

755
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:02,040
Which is that it might be about to explode.

756
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:04,040
Yeah.

757
00:34:04,040 --> 00:34:06,040
Try explaining it. Chances are you'd lose the case.

758
00:34:06,040 --> 00:34:08,040
True.

759
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:10,040
Very true.

760
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:12,040
Why would the author too?

761
00:34:12,040 --> 00:34:14,040
The author of the list.

762
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:16,040
Number 5.

763
00:34:16,040 --> 00:34:18,040
Alright.

764
00:34:18,040 --> 00:34:20,040
I would have put this one number 1.

765
00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:22,040
This is maybe number 1.

766
00:34:22,040 --> 00:34:26,040
Well then you don't have many self-defense skills.

767
00:34:26,040 --> 00:34:29,040
Like me personally, a killer, I just see that as an opportunity.

768
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:31,040
You know, to show what I got.

769
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:34,040
You ever heard of Krav Maga? It's the most Israeli thing of all time.

770
00:34:34,040 --> 00:34:36,040
Do you mind if I destroy you with it?

771
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:38,040
Because I'm about to.

772
00:34:38,040 --> 00:34:42,040
In 3, 2, and then you start up 2, that's one of the Krav Maga phases.

773
00:34:42,040 --> 00:34:47,040
Yeah, you just try to be one of those flip where you run up the wall and just break your teeth.

774
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:50,040
I'm sorry, have you ever seen Don't Mess With the Zohan?

775
00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:59,640
Han yeah it's based on me yes destroy you and any hummus which he does in the

776
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:01,800
movie

777
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:10,440
like put a bomb in Times Square

778
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:16,440
I remember my eyes are really fucked up movie I remember watching that that

779
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:20,600
movie like a sleepover in like fifth grade even then I was like what the fuck is this?

780
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:23,720
I fucking I remember watching the fifth grade just hating it because I didn't

781
00:35:23,720 --> 00:35:28,240
understand the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. I remember watching it when I was a kid

782
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:32,440
being like that's so cool they made up all this like all these countries for this

783
00:35:32,440 --> 00:35:38,440
like so neat and you have all this shit just for this fucking movie. It's so incredible.

784
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:45,160
When you come to him but you see someone who either has a knife or a gun

785
00:35:45,160 --> 00:35:48,160
Unless you have a weapon or you're a black belt in martial arts, you're screwed.

786
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:49,160
Dark Boy X.

787
00:35:49,160 --> 00:35:52,160
Damn, dude. He's like a DMX precursor.

788
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:53,160
Dark Boy X.

789
00:35:53,160 --> 00:35:54,160
DBX?

790
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:55,160
No, Dark Man X.

791
00:35:55,160 --> 00:35:56,160
Okay, cool.

792
00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:58,160
Is that what DMX means?

793
00:35:58,160 --> 00:35:59,160
Dark Man X.

794
00:35:59,160 --> 00:36:02,160
I didn't just, like, say that.

795
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:06,160
I didn't just call him Dark Man X out of nowhere.

796
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:07,160
That's, like, his name.

797
00:36:07,160 --> 00:36:09,160
I don't know. I thought...

798
00:36:09,160 --> 00:36:10,160
No. I don't know.

799
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:13,160
I don't know what I thought DMX stood for.

800
00:36:13,160 --> 00:36:17,160
What did you think? I didn't think Darkman X.

801
00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:21,160
You know, like, ABC, AT&T, DVD, just one of those things.

802
00:36:21,160 --> 00:36:24,160
None of those mean anything, ATM, you know?

803
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:25,160
I get it. It's nothing.

804
00:36:25,160 --> 00:36:28,160
I would be happy. Why? The killer can kill you!

805
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:31,160
It's true. I didn't think about that before I saw that.

806
00:36:31,160 --> 00:36:34,160
I was like, maybe we could team up and kill somebody.

807
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:36,160
Maybe the killer's in there to kill my mom and that's fine.

808
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:37,160
Yeah, exactly.

809
00:36:37,160 --> 00:36:42,160
I used to be really scared of serial killers when I was a kid.

810
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:47,160
because my brother told me that um what's the name of the clown guy that killed himself?

811
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:50,160
John Wayne Gacy.

812
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:54,160
My brother was like John Wayne Gacy faked his own death in the electric chair.

813
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:59,160
And not only that, he's loose in our neighborhood.

814
00:36:59,160 --> 00:37:02,160
And he can be here at any moment.

815
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:06,160
And then unbeknownst to me, he went to Spencer Gifts and bought a clown mask.

816
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:09,160
And he stood outside my window.

817
00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:17,240
and that's why I do a podcast now. Everything I hear about your older

818
00:37:17,240 --> 00:37:22,360
brother, he's so evil. He was horrible. And every time he sees me now,

819
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:26,240
because we're adults now, you know, every time he sees me he's like, "Hey man, sorry, I was a

820
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:32,720
cussing evil guy the whole time." I just, you know, I'd start figuring out, try to figure shit out.

821
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:34,720
I don't get divorced parents, it's tough.

822
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:36,720
(laughter)

823
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:39,720
Number six, an alien spaceship.

824
00:37:39,720 --> 00:37:41,720
Again, you'd fucking score.

825
00:37:41,720 --> 00:37:43,720
I don't know what this shit is about, dude.

826
00:37:43,720 --> 00:37:45,720
Dude, I would sell that shit immediately.

827
00:37:45,720 --> 00:37:50,720
Do you think that this UFO shit is the government trying to pretend some shit?

828
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:51,720
Yes.

829
00:37:51,720 --> 00:37:52,720
Yeah?

830
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:53,720
Well, think about it, UFOs...

831
00:37:53,720 --> 00:37:54,720
Well, sir, we have an expert here.

832
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:56,720
You say you're a UFO-logist, right?

833
00:37:56,720 --> 00:37:58,720
(laughter)

834
00:37:58,720 --> 00:37:59,720
No.

835
00:37:59,720 --> 00:38:01,720
No, no, you're not.

836
00:38:01,720 --> 00:38:04,200
I've seen really weird things in the sky.

837
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:05,640
You've seen a UFO?

838
00:38:05,640 --> 00:38:09,720
I've seen something that I couldn't identify in the sky.

839
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:10,440
Oh shit.

840
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:12,120
I mean I can't explain how a plane flies.

841
00:38:12,120 --> 00:38:12,620
Yeah.

842
00:38:12,620 --> 00:38:13,720
That's pretty tough.

843
00:38:13,720 --> 00:38:17,320
My uncle, I don't know if people know this, he's a ghost hunter.

844
00:38:17,320 --> 00:38:18,280
Oh yeah, well man.

845
00:38:18,280 --> 00:38:19,160
I have a ghost hunter uncle.

846
00:38:19,160 --> 00:38:27,640
One time he sent me a video of the moon and he was like, "I found a UFO."

847
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:31,640
I was like half blind.

848
00:38:31,640 --> 00:38:33,640
We're just making shit up now.

849
00:38:33,640 --> 00:38:37,640
He's half blind, he has a peg leg, and he has wax lips.

850
00:38:37,640 --> 00:38:42,640
But yeah, he kept sending me videos and I kept being like, "Uncle Matt, that is the moon."

851
00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:45,640
And he kept being like, "Ah, we had to be there."

852
00:38:45,640 --> 00:38:48,640
And then his friends started shooting the moon.

853
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:50,640
Because he was like, "We have to defend Earth."

854
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:54,640
So he started fucking... North Carolina has like an AR-15.

855
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:57,640
In the backyard, they just started shooting at the fucking moon.

856
00:38:57,640 --> 00:39:03,040
The thing about a UFO is all that means is it's just something in the sky and you don't

857
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:04,040
know what it is.

858
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:05,040
That's all.

859
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:06,440
You can see like a scary shaped cloud.

860
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:07,440
That is a UFO.

861
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:09,440
Dude, if you can't tell it's a cloud, that's a limit.

862
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:10,440
Anything can be a UFO.

863
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:11,440
Yeah.

864
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:17,560
The message I want all of you to take home tonight.

865
00:39:17,560 --> 00:39:18,560
That's so beautiful.

866
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:21,480
Wow, that's so gorgeous that you said that.

867
00:39:21,480 --> 00:39:23,320
Oh my God, dude.

868
00:39:23,320 --> 00:39:26,200
I would kiss them, invite them for dinner, and then I would take home with them.

869
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:27,200
I like aliens.

870
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:29,200
This guy's weird.

871
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:31,200
You're weird.

872
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:33,200
Yeah.

873
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:36,200
They can research our brains and personality and they will use the information to kill us.

874
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:39,200
Just act dumb and you'll stay alive.

875
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:40,200
Yeah.

876
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:41,200
You think that would work?

877
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:42,200
I think it might work.

878
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:47,200
I don't know. I don't think that you could act so dumb that they don't care.

879
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:48,200
Yeah.

880
00:39:48,200 --> 00:39:50,200
They're like, "Ah, you know, this guy's so stupid."

881
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:52,200
Maybe you gotta act like another animal.

882
00:39:52,200 --> 00:39:53,200
You know, if you...

883
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:55,200
Oh, that's actually a great idea.

884
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:57,200
Maybe when you just act like you're a friend.

885
00:39:57,200 --> 00:40:01,200
When you have a friend who's one of those two person horse costumes they use in plays.

886
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:02,200
Yeah.

887
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:03,200
You might really get away with it actually.

888
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:05,200
Well, I mean, you don't want no damn horse.

889
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:09,200
That's true. Yeah, they do skip horses when they like abduct shit.

890
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:11,200
So I guess the one animal just don't be a cow.

891
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:12,200
Yeah.

892
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:13,200
If you're a cow, you're getting fucked.

893
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:14,200
Yeah.

894
00:40:14,200 --> 00:40:15,200
You're getting probed and shit.

895
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:17,200
What do you think they're doing with those cows though?

896
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:19,200
I think they're just like, they're eating good.

897
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:21,200
Yeah, they're just like making hamburgers.

898
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:23,200
They're just dumping food.

899
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:25,200
That's exactly what we do at Gals.

900
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:27,200
It's like, this is like the best shit ever.

901
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:37,200
I think this guy might be wrong, because like, you know, if you're in a room and there's like the stupidest animal ever, and then the cutest animal ever, I'm killing the stupidest one.

902
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:38,200
Yeah, that's true.

903
00:40:38,200 --> 00:40:40,200
Stupidest and smartest, you'll kill the stupid one.

904
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:43,200
That's what I would do, I guess, is I would try to be really cute when they walk in.

905
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:44,200
Yeah.

906
00:40:44,200 --> 00:40:48,200
Are you an alien?

907
00:40:48,200 --> 00:40:52,200
And then I'd show them my butthole.

908
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:54,200
I might not like that actually.

909
00:40:54,200 --> 00:40:56,200
No, they would love that. What are you talking about?

910
00:40:56,200 --> 00:40:58,200
I forgot I'm talking about aliens here.

911
00:40:58,200 --> 00:41:00,200
Yeah.

912
00:41:00,200 --> 00:41:02,200
Famous butthole lovers.

913
00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:04,200
You guys love the butt.

914
00:41:04,200 --> 00:41:06,200
Number 7, a mosquito nest. Big step down.

915
00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:08,200
Yeah.

916
00:41:08,200 --> 00:41:10,200
I mean it would be annoying.

917
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:12,200
Do they live in nests?

918
00:41:12,200 --> 00:41:14,200
I don't think they live in nests. I think they live in water.

919
00:41:14,200 --> 00:41:16,200
They live outside.

920
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:18,200
I live off the streets.

921
00:41:18,200 --> 00:41:20,200
I think that's a lie.

922
00:41:20,200 --> 00:41:27,760
right now this could be very you know why I was just thinking about this you might

923
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:30,960
get attacked by the mosquitoes

924
00:41:39,600 --> 00:41:44,600
I think I would rather have a beehive in my house than a mosquito nest.

925
00:41:44,600 --> 00:41:45,600
Why?

926
00:41:45,600 --> 00:41:47,600
Because bees are cool.

927
00:41:47,600 --> 00:41:50,600
You get honey out of them.

928
00:41:50,600 --> 00:41:52,600
You get stung.

929
00:41:52,600 --> 00:41:54,600
You just can't smoke.

930
00:41:54,600 --> 00:41:56,600
I actually don't know how normalizing for bees.

931
00:41:56,600 --> 00:41:58,600
They like to smoke, right?

932
00:41:58,600 --> 00:42:00,600
Do they like smoke?

933
00:42:00,600 --> 00:42:02,600
I don't know anything about bees.

934
00:42:02,600 --> 00:42:04,600
Do they go to sleep when they touch smoke or something?

935
00:42:04,600 --> 00:42:06,600
I don't think that means they like it.

936
00:42:06,600 --> 00:42:12,200
just completely pass out when they touch it they fucking love it. I fall asleep when I'm watching

937
00:42:12,200 --> 00:42:23,080
YouTube and I love YouTube. That's a very good point. Uh oh, this will be ours. I like the one

938
00:42:23,080 --> 00:42:27,160
two punch of Matrix guy and dubstep lover. Yeah that is good. And actually now I am remembering

939
00:42:27,160 --> 00:42:31,320
I saw the username dubstep lover I thought it was funny I clicked on their profile so the next slide

940
00:42:31,320 --> 00:42:32,320
that is their profile.

941
00:42:32,320 --> 00:42:34,320
(laughter)

942
00:42:34,320 --> 00:42:35,320
Alright dude, let's fucking go.

943
00:42:35,320 --> 00:42:36,320
Just remember that just now.

944
00:42:36,320 --> 00:42:40,320
Yeah, I was saying like, it kind of sucks that we can't click on people's profiles.

945
00:42:40,320 --> 00:42:42,320
Yeah, this is, you planned for this.

946
00:42:42,320 --> 00:42:43,320
So this is Dubstep Lover.

947
00:42:43,320 --> 00:42:44,320
Oh.

948
00:42:44,320 --> 00:42:45,320
This is their profile picture.

949
00:42:45,320 --> 00:42:49,320
This text says, "I went on a quest to find a site that actually has a good community.

950
00:42:49,320 --> 00:42:51,320
I've lost hope and I found the top 10."

951
00:42:51,320 --> 00:42:52,320
Oh shit.

952
00:42:52,320 --> 00:42:53,320
That's their avatar.

953
00:42:53,320 --> 00:42:54,320
Come on, they're beefing.

954
00:42:54,320 --> 00:42:55,320
I suspect.

955
00:42:55,320 --> 00:42:56,320
"Hello there, the top 10's user.

956
00:42:56,320 --> 00:43:00,320
You are probably reading my profile right now because you have seen one of my quote 'troll'

957
00:43:00,320 --> 00:43:05,320
Yes, troll totally means a person who dislikes something.

958
00:43:05,320 --> 00:43:09,320
And you totally will call someone a troll when they hate something you hate as well.

959
00:43:09,320 --> 00:43:13,320
And now you are probably going to say, "I'm some troll," and you'd say something extremely non-edgy,

960
00:43:13,320 --> 00:43:17,320
like, "Don't feed the troll," or, "She's an obvious troll."

961
00:43:17,320 --> 00:43:20,320
Oh, wait, you don't know what a troll is. Not surprised.

962
00:43:20,320 --> 00:43:22,320
21 years old, ladies and gentlemen.

963
00:43:22,320 --> 00:43:25,320
-Stands right there. -21.

964
00:43:25,320 --> 00:43:27,320
-Their name is Saltiness? -They could be at this show right now.

965
00:43:27,320 --> 00:43:29,320
- I would say saltiness.

966
00:43:29,320 --> 00:43:34,320
The next slide is a selection of the lists that they have created.

967
00:43:34,320 --> 00:43:35,320
- Okay.

968
00:43:35,320 --> 00:43:37,320
- Alright, I'm seeing a detour here.

969
00:43:37,320 --> 00:43:38,320
- Yeah.

970
00:43:38,320 --> 00:43:39,320
- This is just a short detour.

971
00:43:39,320 --> 00:43:40,320
- I'm sorry.

972
00:43:40,320 --> 00:43:42,320
- This is like a person twisted by this website.

973
00:43:42,320 --> 00:43:43,320
- Okay.

974
00:43:43,320 --> 00:43:45,320
- This is like Gollum.

975
00:43:45,320 --> 00:43:46,320
- Okay.

976
00:43:46,320 --> 00:43:47,320
- Like, we spent too much time here.

977
00:43:47,320 --> 00:43:48,320
- Yeah, yeah, no, I get it.

978
00:43:48,320 --> 00:43:50,320
- I don't even think they love Goat Sip anymore.

979
00:43:50,320 --> 00:43:53,320
- Things that top 10 users say as a response to trolls.

980
00:43:53,320 --> 00:43:55,320
Things people say before blocking someone they're in a flame war with.

981
00:43:55,320 --> 00:43:58,680
with top 10 reasons people should stop hating on haters top 10 types of people

982
00:43:58,680 --> 00:44:02,320
mistakenly called trolls. Things that will make everyone in the top 10 stop being so salty and edgy.

983
00:44:02,320 --> 00:44:06,320
Most reasonable answers to answer the question why can't a top tens user learn to take a small joke.

984
00:44:06,320 --> 00:44:09,320
First kinds of comments on the top tens item. Best things about an Oregano.

985
00:44:09,320 --> 00:44:17,320
[laughter]

986
00:44:17,320 --> 00:44:20,320
I mean that's a perfect punchline.

987
00:44:20,320 --> 00:44:25,320
Oh my god. There's never been a better punch line. Best things about an Oreo.

988
00:44:25,320 --> 00:44:28,320
Not even like Oreo flavor. That's the best thing.

989
00:44:28,320 --> 00:44:32,320
Just the one flavor. The one Oreo flavor.

990
00:44:32,320 --> 00:44:36,320
I like the cookie number two. I like the cream.

991
00:44:36,320 --> 00:44:41,320
Anyway, back to the...

992
00:44:41,320 --> 00:44:44,320
I love my corpse. Yeah, I'm corpse.

993
00:44:44,320 --> 00:44:47,320
What are you guys going to do for your funeral? Because one of us is going to die first.

994
00:44:47,320 --> 00:44:51,400
yeah yeah I don't think probably you make sure that we're not gonna die the same

995
00:44:51,400 --> 00:44:56,120
Cameron's gonna live to be way too old and he's gonna look very weird as an old man

996
00:44:56,120 --> 00:45:00,360
I genuinely hope I look extremely strange as an old man

997
00:45:00,360 --> 00:45:03,960
yeah you're gonna look like Gandalf I can tell you that right now

998
00:45:03,960 --> 00:45:09,240
I've probably got six years and I would love a Harry Potter themed

999
00:45:09,240 --> 00:45:15,960
I think that would fit my personality and my style and taste in things by the way I'm a Slytherin

1000
00:45:15,960 --> 00:45:18,960
I was about to ask, I'm glad you said that.

1001
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:21,960
I mean, the Rick and Morty, you can tell immediately.

1002
00:45:21,960 --> 00:45:25,960
You know I'm a Slytherin because all the quizzes, the first question is like, "Are you evil?"

1003
00:45:25,960 --> 00:45:27,960
I'm like, "Yes I am!"

1004
00:45:27,960 --> 00:45:29,960
Do you like death magic?

1005
00:45:29,960 --> 00:45:34,960
I'm trying to get a Gryffindor. Yeah, I guess I like death magic and killing things.

1006
00:45:34,960 --> 00:45:36,960
That's the most evil piece of shit of all time.

1007
00:45:36,960 --> 00:45:38,960
Fuck Slytherin, fuck.

1008
00:45:38,960 --> 00:45:42,960
That depends. Is it a lover? A former lover? A politician?

1009
00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:48,440
I would really be upset to get home from work and find myself dead on the floor. It's a monster corpse

1010
00:45:48,440 --> 00:45:52,360
So first of all politician

1011
00:45:52,360 --> 00:45:54,720
That's crazy

1012
00:45:54,720 --> 00:45:58,220
Series of you walk in here as JFK jr. Is on your floor

1013
00:45:58,220 --> 00:46:03,880
As JFK jr. Like now like he's fucked up. That's bad news

1014
00:46:03,880 --> 00:46:08,920
That is getting me in trouble

1015
00:46:08,920 --> 00:46:12,920
Don't say that. I'm in trouble right now.

1016
00:46:12,920 --> 00:46:15,920
It's a monster corpse. I don't know which one's scarier.

1017
00:46:15,920 --> 00:46:18,920
As a politician, you're going to get blamed for that. That's the problem.

1018
00:46:18,920 --> 00:46:20,920
Or I would get blamed for it.

1019
00:46:20,920 --> 00:46:24,920
I don't know that everybody would get blamed for it, but...

1020
00:46:24,920 --> 00:46:26,920
Old Caleb would.

1021
00:46:26,920 --> 00:46:28,920
A monster corpse is scary.

1022
00:46:28,920 --> 00:46:30,920
It's a monster corpse, and it's a politician.

1023
00:46:30,920 --> 00:46:32,920
Charlie Baker!

1024
00:46:32,920 --> 00:46:35,920
Can we just stop naming politicians now?

1025
00:46:35,920 --> 00:46:36,920
Fucking great.

1026
00:46:36,920 --> 00:46:37,920
We can't win this.

1027
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:38,920
I know!

1028
00:46:38,920 --> 00:46:39,920
Joe Manchin, that's actually a really good point.

1029
00:46:39,920 --> 00:46:40,920
Joe Manchin, yeah!

1030
00:46:40,920 --> 00:46:41,920
Wow!

1031
00:46:41,920 --> 00:46:42,920
Who's that guy?

1032
00:46:42,920 --> 00:46:43,920
I don't know.

1033
00:46:43,920 --> 00:46:44,920
He's back there from West Virginia.

1034
00:46:44,920 --> 00:46:45,920
Yeah.

1035
00:46:45,920 --> 00:46:46,920
Oh, it's just like a deceased.

1036
00:46:46,920 --> 00:46:47,920
Yeah, I don't need an explainer.

1037
00:46:47,920 --> 00:46:48,920
Not a thing you want to see, not a comment you want to see either, I think.

1038
00:46:48,920 --> 00:46:49,920
Yeah.

1039
00:46:49,920 --> 00:46:50,920
That was a deceased, like, our audience are wordy, man.

1040
00:46:50,920 --> 00:46:51,920
Right.

1041
00:46:51,920 --> 00:46:52,920
I mean, yeah, I mean, it was.

1042
00:46:52,920 --> 00:46:53,920
Deceased adds another level.

1043
00:46:53,920 --> 00:46:54,920
This second was a deceased, you know, he did.

1044
00:46:54,920 --> 00:46:55,920
Yeah, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean,

1045
00:46:55,920 --> 00:46:58,920
Not a thing you want to see, not a comment you want to see either I think.

1046
00:46:58,920 --> 00:47:01,920
That was a deceased, like writings are wordy man.

1047
00:47:01,920 --> 00:47:03,920
I mean yeah, I mean it was deceased.

1048
00:47:03,920 --> 00:47:05,920
This second is a deceased, you know he did it.

1049
00:47:05,920 --> 00:47:07,920
Yeah.

1050
00:47:07,920 --> 00:47:09,920
Oh no, somebody deceased.

1051
00:47:09,920 --> 00:47:12,920
Tom's not going to join, like, "Oh you hear about my deceased girlfriend?"

1052
00:47:12,920 --> 00:47:14,920
"I had nothing to do with it by the way."

1053
00:47:14,920 --> 00:47:16,920
That's not going to sell.

1054
00:47:16,920 --> 00:47:18,920
Yeah.

1055
00:47:18,920 --> 00:47:19,920
Number 98.

1056
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:21,920
Oh shit.

1057
00:47:21,920 --> 00:47:24,920
Is anybody else sick of this guy?

1058
00:47:24,920 --> 00:47:26,920
I'm so mad at you.

1059
00:47:26,920 --> 00:47:28,920
Fuck this guy, right?

1060
00:47:28,920 --> 00:47:29,920
This guy's a piece of shit.

1061
00:47:29,920 --> 00:47:32,920
I hate him so much. I probably hate him more than any of you.

1062
00:47:32,920 --> 00:47:34,920
I probably hate him more than you.

1063
00:47:34,920 --> 00:47:36,920
I probably hate him the most of anybody in the whole world.

1064
00:47:36,920 --> 00:47:38,920
No, probably less than me.

1065
00:47:38,920 --> 00:47:40,920
Probably number one in the world.

1066
00:47:40,920 --> 00:47:42,920
Probably way less than me.

1067
00:47:42,920 --> 00:47:44,920
Nah, I'm probably the number one guy.

1068
00:47:44,920 --> 00:47:46,920
Yeah, I don't know about that.

1069
00:47:46,920 --> 00:47:48,920
I don't know, I mean I like shit around.

1070
00:47:48,920 --> 00:47:50,920
I hate it.

1071
00:47:50,920 --> 00:47:52,920
Check yourself.

1072
00:47:52,920 --> 00:47:59,800
do that. Oh fuck. I don't hold it. You're not pointing it. Caleb is the first guy to hold

1073
00:47:59,800 --> 00:48:03,800
two opposite records in Guinness Book of World Records. Number one, Hitler Hater.

1074
00:48:03,800 --> 00:48:14,600
And juggling, that's the other one. What an amazing juggler. Fucking incredible at it. I

1075
00:48:14,600 --> 00:48:21,800
could juggle one ball. I'm like really good. Yeah, yeah. He would be running around my house

1076
00:48:21,800 --> 00:48:25,160
screaming in German and I would have a difficult time trying to catch him with a net.

1077
00:48:25,160 --> 00:48:27,160
Why a net?

1078
00:48:27,160 --> 00:48:29,160
Get the Hitler net dude, he's back.

1079
00:48:29,160 --> 00:48:31,160
Yeah.

1080
00:48:31,160 --> 00:48:38,160
I mean I would just, you know, first of all I'd say I don't like what, like I don't like you.

1081
00:48:38,160 --> 00:48:42,160
But, do you want to play GameCube? It's like an amazing story.

1082
00:48:42,160 --> 00:48:44,160
When you think about it, like nobody's going to believe this shit.

1083
00:48:44,160 --> 00:48:46,160
Do you want to take a picture with me?

1084
00:48:46,160 --> 00:48:50,160
I mean in that way he's exactly like Bill Murray.

1085
00:48:50,160 --> 00:48:59,780
I hate this guy.

1086
00:48:59,780 --> 00:49:01,440
I hate it when I find Hitler in my house.

1087
00:49:01,440 --> 00:49:04,440
This brings back such terrible memories.

1088
00:49:04,440 --> 00:49:06,440
Yeah, fair.

1089
00:49:11,440 --> 00:49:18,440
percent chance Hitler is dead. But there's that one, one millionth of a percent.

1090
00:49:18,440 --> 00:49:25,640
Single millionth of a percent that, ah fuck, maybe he's still out there. I do like, yeah, I remember asking my mom, or my mom watched some

1091
00:49:25,640 --> 00:49:30,480
documentary about like Nazis in like Argentina like hiding and shit and she

1092
00:49:30,480 --> 00:49:37,120
was like, she called me, it was another bad fucking call from mom, she was like, did you know that Hitler, Adolf Hitler, might still be alive?

1093
00:49:37,120 --> 00:49:42,120
And I looked it up and I was like, "Mommy, be like 140 years old."

1094
00:49:42,120 --> 00:49:48,120
And then she responded to me exactly like this, she was like, "They have Nazi technology."

1095
00:49:48,120 --> 00:49:51,120
And there's nothing I could do.

1096
00:49:51,120 --> 00:49:53,120
She still believes it, too.

1097
00:49:53,120 --> 00:49:55,120
There's nothing I could fucking say.

1098
00:49:55,120 --> 00:49:56,120
You know what? Good point.

1099
00:49:56,120 --> 00:49:58,120
They have Nazi technology.

1100
00:49:58,120 --> 00:50:00,120
Can't really refute that.

1101
00:50:00,120 --> 00:50:02,120
Yeah, what are you going to say? "No, they don't."

1102
00:50:02,120 --> 00:50:03,120
Yeah, "No, they don't."

1103
00:50:03,120 --> 00:50:06,120
I guess the word "Nazi" said it in a sense.

1104
00:50:06,120 --> 00:50:12,560
fuck. Number 10 illegal fireworks. This is a good time. Oh, no,

1105
00:50:12,560 --> 00:50:15,960
there's a party in my house. Oh, Christ. Coming home and seeing

1106
00:50:15,960 --> 00:50:18,520
fireworks and being pissed off. Yeah, what the fuck?

1107
00:50:18,520 --> 00:50:21,000
I'm a loser. I work too expensive. Well, I guess that

1108
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:23,680
they're okay. If they're being like lit in your house. It's

1109
00:50:23,680 --> 00:50:25,080
probably annoying. Yeah.

1110
00:50:25,080 --> 00:50:30,400
A big New Year's.

1111
00:50:30,400 --> 00:50:32,800
Clearly Disney.

1112
00:50:34,560 --> 00:50:38,440
Mickey Mouse sucks dude that's why they're illegal you can't like show

1113
00:50:38,440 --> 00:50:42,480
I walk in and I see the New Year's display and I'm so pissed off because it's

1114
00:50:42,480 --> 00:50:48,160
it's fucking June dude it's not that's for wasting these early they need them

1115
00:50:48,160 --> 00:50:56,160
yeah the contenders yeah number four

1116
00:50:56,160 --> 00:51:01,280
which maybe is worse than Hitler himself I mean who can say that's true you can go through walls

1117
00:51:01,280 --> 00:51:06,280
Yeah, true. Yeah. I'm finally free from Hitler on the other side of this wall.

1118
00:51:06,280 --> 00:51:12,280
Fuck you, dude! Are you kidding me? He's a ghost now? It sucks, cock.

1119
00:51:12,280 --> 00:51:15,280
I hate you, ghost Hitler. So on and so forth. Yeah.

1120
00:51:15,280 --> 00:51:18,280
Yeah, et cetera, et cetera.

1121
00:51:18,280 --> 00:51:21,280
The toilet having exploded. Now, yeah, this--

1122
00:51:21,280 --> 00:51:27,280
Better than me, I've had to use buckets to cramp it.

1123
00:51:27,280 --> 00:51:30,640
What do they mean better than, like the toilet is better than them?

1124
00:51:30,640 --> 00:51:32,640
What does that fucking mean?

1125
00:51:32,640 --> 00:51:36,080
Have you ever crapped in something other than a traditional toilet?

1126
00:51:36,080 --> 00:51:36,580
Yeah.

1127
00:51:36,580 --> 00:51:37,080
What was it?

1128
00:51:37,080 --> 00:51:39,080
I crapped outside when I was like six.

1129
00:51:39,080 --> 00:51:43,080
I used to have a crapping tree that I would...

1130
00:51:43,080 --> 00:51:45,080
Not kidding.

1131
00:51:45,080 --> 00:51:46,080
I'm not fucking kidding.

1132
00:51:46,080 --> 00:51:49,080
Me and my friend Liam, we went out and I lived like next to the marsh.

1133
00:51:49,080 --> 00:51:51,080
We had a big, there was a big tree back there.

1134
00:51:51,080 --> 00:51:55,080
And for some reason my ass fit perfectly on two branches.

1135
00:51:55,080 --> 00:52:04,080
And so I would go and I would leave my house and then walk like half a mile and then go take a shit out of a tree.

1136
00:52:04,080 --> 00:52:07,080
Because I was like, "I'm fucking this coolest fuck."

1137
00:52:07,080 --> 00:52:11,080
There I was dude, now I have a story.

1138
00:52:11,080 --> 00:52:13,080
You'd like bark as toilet paper or...

1139
00:52:13,080 --> 00:52:15,080
What do you mean, dude? What do you think?

1140
00:52:15,080 --> 00:52:17,080
You're obviously not a survivalist like me.

1141
00:52:17,080 --> 00:52:19,080
I wouldn't go for bark.

1142
00:52:19,080 --> 00:52:21,080
You'd be using a twig.

1143
00:52:21,080 --> 00:52:23,080
I wouldn't fuck you. Come on, man.

1144
00:52:23,080 --> 00:52:25,080
Nah dude, I would do that.

1145
00:52:25,080 --> 00:52:27,080
I also, I do want to defend myself about the leaves thing.

1146
00:52:27,080 --> 00:52:31,080
I don't think any tree that's been shitting next to you for years is going to have leaves for very long.

1147
00:52:31,080 --> 00:52:33,080
I mean, you're shitting to do trees.

1148
00:52:33,080 --> 00:52:35,080
Good thing, I made a pile out of it.

1149
00:52:35,080 --> 00:52:37,080
Good point, like two months. Like, that's pretty impressive actually.

1150
00:52:37,080 --> 00:52:41,080
And don't think about the fact that that's fertilizer, because I just thought about that, so don't think about that.

1151
00:52:41,080 --> 00:52:43,080
I got boogies.

1152
00:52:43,080 --> 00:52:46,080
Number 19, Dora jumping out of the TV.

1153
00:52:46,080 --> 00:52:47,080
Oh, hell no.

1154
00:52:47,080 --> 00:52:48,080
Don't worry, Dora.

1155
00:52:48,080 --> 00:52:49,080
Oh, no.

1156
00:52:49,080 --> 00:52:50,080
Do you guys hate learning?

1157
00:52:50,080 --> 00:52:51,080
What's wrong with you?

1158
00:52:51,080 --> 00:52:53,080
She cannot look out of the TV.

1159
00:52:53,080 --> 00:52:55,080
Why are you afraid of Dora?

1160
00:52:55,080 --> 00:52:57,080
Too small.

1161
00:52:57,080 --> 00:52:59,080
What's wrong with you?

1162
00:52:59,080 --> 00:53:01,080
It's like she's like a bug, dude.

1163
00:53:01,080 --> 00:53:03,080
I learned that from you.

1164
00:53:03,080 --> 00:53:05,080
My creepy crawly sense goes off.

1165
00:53:05,080 --> 00:53:07,080
It's like when I hit her with a shoe,

1166
00:53:07,080 --> 00:53:09,080
it's smash her.

1167
00:53:09,080 --> 00:53:11,080
Dora rules, man.

1168
00:53:11,080 --> 00:53:13,080
She taught me every word of Spanish I know.

1169
00:53:13,080 --> 00:53:15,080
I know "Hola" and "Chocolate".

1170
00:53:15,080 --> 00:53:17,080
I learned "backpack".

1171
00:53:17,080 --> 00:53:19,080
Yeah, "backpack".

1172
00:53:19,080 --> 00:53:22,080
I think in Spanish it might be backpack.

1173
00:53:22,080 --> 00:53:24,080
Good point.

1174
00:53:24,080 --> 00:53:26,080
According to that show.

1175
00:53:26,080 --> 00:53:29,080
Number 25, robber.

1176
00:53:29,080 --> 00:53:35,080
My best friend is one.

1177
00:53:35,080 --> 00:53:36,080
Yeah.

1178
00:53:36,080 --> 00:53:38,080
You guys know any robbers?

1179
00:53:38,080 --> 00:53:39,080
Not yet.

1180
00:53:39,080 --> 00:53:41,080
Is there a robber in this room?

1181
00:53:41,080 --> 00:53:42,080
Yes.

1182
00:53:42,080 --> 00:53:44,080
There's no way you're a robber.

1183
00:53:44,080 --> 00:53:47,080
I stole a shirt from Target like two days ago.

1184
00:53:47,080 --> 00:53:49,000
Nice. That's not a robbery.

1185
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:56,920
Robbery is when you put on the mask. Yeah, right. Sure.

1186
00:53:56,920 --> 00:53:58,640
Bad.

1187
00:53:58,640 --> 00:54:02,920
I think I could get away with robbing a bank in the south.

1188
00:54:02,920 --> 00:54:06,960
I escape into a sea of people dress exactly like

1189
00:54:06,960 --> 00:54:12,960
you do look like you just did do a bank robbery.

1190
00:54:16,320 --> 00:54:23,320
tag on these. It's large, yeah, 5'9". It's a large. They're all jealous.

1191
00:54:23,320 --> 00:54:29,320
Are you going to return them? No, no. We're going to auction them off.

1192
00:54:29,320 --> 00:54:34,320
If nobody liked them, then I would have returned them, but I'm going to be wearing these again.

1193
00:54:34,320 --> 00:54:38,320
You better believe that. This is not the last you've seen of my sweatpants.

1194
00:54:38,320 --> 00:54:43,320
Number 28, a psychopath bent on revenge to torture you.

1195
00:54:43,320 --> 00:54:44,320
Psychopath.

1196
00:54:44,320 --> 00:54:46,520
Yeah, I would say that's pretty much worst case scenario.

1197
00:54:46,520 --> 00:54:47,520
Absolutely.

1198
00:54:47,520 --> 00:54:48,520
Yeah.

1199
00:54:48,520 --> 00:54:50,520
Yeah, your arch nemesis is in there.

1200
00:54:50,520 --> 00:54:51,520
Yeah, it's like, that sucks.

1201
00:54:51,520 --> 00:54:52,520
Yeah.

1202
00:54:52,520 --> 00:54:53,520
Did you guys ever have a rival growing up?

1203
00:54:53,520 --> 00:54:54,520
Arch nemesis?

1204
00:54:54,520 --> 00:54:55,520
Yeah.

1205
00:54:55,520 --> 00:54:56,520
We tried to get a rival the other day.

1206
00:54:56,520 --> 00:54:57,520
Who was my rival?

1207
00:54:57,520 --> 00:55:08,520
We were, so we were leaving somewhere, me and Caleb were leaving a place, and like, we took

1208
00:55:08,520 --> 00:55:14,600
like a lift, the lift driver was telling like some guy was like in two lanes or

1209
00:55:14,600 --> 00:55:19,800
something he honked the horn was like it's two lanes asshole. I don't think he said

1210
00:55:19,800 --> 00:55:24,240
anything. Yeah he said it's two lanes. Okay well maybe I suck at hearing. Yeah you do

1211
00:55:24,240 --> 00:55:29,360
because you turned to the guy and you said oh is that your rival?

1212
00:55:29,360 --> 00:55:37,940
And then for the rest of the car ride just to make me uncomfortable he's

1213
00:55:37,940 --> 00:55:44,020
sitting there like yeah I'm thinking about getting a rival pretty soon. I think I need a rival.

1214
00:55:44,020 --> 00:55:48,500
Someone that looks like me. You went on for like a good couple minutes.

1215
00:55:48,500 --> 00:56:04,260
The 15 minute drive. One of the most like uncomfortable conversations I've ever had in like a lift was me and Alex were in a lift. It was like a pool and so there were other people in there. The guy started talking to us like hey like what's up? Like where are you guys coming from? And Alex was like oh I just watched this movie Rango.

1216
00:56:04,260 --> 00:56:11,260
I was like, "Dude, not let a Lyft driver go out on Rango, dude. He's never going to stop."

1217
00:56:11,260 --> 00:56:14,260
The Lyft driver was like, "Oh, what's that? I haven't heard of it."

1218
00:56:14,260 --> 00:56:18,260
He's like, "Oh, you should watch it, dude. It's pretty good. It's Johnny Depp plays this chameleon.

1219
00:56:18,260 --> 00:56:20,260
He's a cowboy."

1220
00:56:20,260 --> 00:56:24,260
And then the Lyft driver asked, he was silent for a little bit, and he's like,

1221
00:56:24,260 --> 00:56:28,260
"Did Rango ever have to, you know, kill anybody?"

1222
00:56:32,260 --> 00:56:36,260
I don't think so man and there's silence.

1223
00:56:36,260 --> 00:56:40,260
[Laughter]

1224
00:56:40,260 --> 00:56:42,260
For the rest of you.

1225
00:56:42,260 --> 00:56:44,260
[Laughter]

1226
00:56:44,260 --> 00:56:46,260
The most insane follow up question I could ever get.

1227
00:56:46,260 --> 00:56:48,260
That's sick dude. Good for him.

1228
00:56:48,260 --> 00:56:50,260
[Laughter]

1229
00:56:50,260 --> 00:56:54,260
One time I had a Lyft driver in like Brown University.

1230
00:56:54,260 --> 00:56:56,260
I was doing a show there. The Lyft driver was like,

1231
00:56:56,260 --> 00:57:01,260
"Yeah man, you guys like don't jaywalk because the cops will take you down to the train tracks and they'll beat you to death."

1232
00:57:01,260 --> 00:57:04,260
We're like, "We don't believe that, man."

1233
00:57:04,260 --> 00:57:07,260
Like, "I don't like cops, but I don't believe that."

1234
00:57:07,260 --> 00:57:09,260
That's crazy.

1235
00:57:09,260 --> 00:57:11,260
Where's-- Browns and Rhode Island?

1236
00:57:11,260 --> 00:57:13,260
Yeah.

1237
00:57:13,260 --> 00:57:16,260
Yeah, I don't think a cop in Rhode Island would do that.

1238
00:57:16,260 --> 00:57:23,260
Extra homework. I gotta kill myself.

1239
00:57:23,260 --> 00:57:25,260
I gotta kill myself.

1240
00:57:25,260 --> 00:57:27,260
I gotta kill myself.

1241
00:57:27,260 --> 00:57:30,260
I mean, I don't blame him. Extra homework?

1242
00:57:30,260 --> 00:57:32,260
Yeah, just walked out dude.

1243
00:57:32,260 --> 00:57:33,260
Yeah.

1244
00:57:33,260 --> 00:57:35,260
Number one, Popo.

1245
00:57:35,260 --> 00:57:36,260
Popo.

1246
00:57:36,260 --> 00:57:39,260
I'm no expert, but maybe it means poop.

1247
00:57:39,260 --> 00:57:42,260
Ralph Bob says this means police.

1248
00:57:42,260 --> 00:57:48,260
My same UFO hunting uncle, one time when I was a kid, he's a volunteer firefighter, right?

1249
00:57:48,260 --> 00:57:49,260
He's a hero.

1250
00:57:49,260 --> 00:57:50,260
Woo!

1251
00:57:50,260 --> 00:57:53,260
Everybody, yeah, you should fucking beat this guy before you woo.

1252
00:57:53,260 --> 00:57:59,260
He was like, one time I called police to Popo, cause you know, I'm me, I'm cool.

1253
00:57:59,260 --> 00:58:06,700
cool and he was like don't you ever say po po that's like saying the n-word I

1254
00:58:06,700 --> 00:58:16,300
was like no man I don't think it is your head is made out of metal I think that's the problem here and you hunt the moon at night

1255
00:58:16,300 --> 00:58:24,740
I'm not sure that's that's my fault number 113 dr. Eggman he will be a tough

1256
00:58:24,740 --> 00:58:27,580
housemate. That's just the good. Yeah, he's gonna eat everything.

1257
00:58:27,580 --> 00:58:31,900
Fucking making robots. Yeah, it's fucked up. Leave me alone, dude.

1258
00:58:31,900 --> 00:58:36,380
This is the last one. Balloon Boy. Balloon Boy.

1259
00:58:36,380 --> 00:58:41,660
No, Balloon Boy. I'm sorry. I misread. I thought it said Balloon Boy.

1260
00:58:41,660 --> 00:58:43,380
grabs gun and shoots it multiple times.

1261
00:58:43,380 --> 00:58:50,700
Is this is this a I love still being mad at Balloon Boy. Yeah, that's like the

1262
00:58:50,700 --> 00:58:55,420
coolest shit you can do is you still being that little scene. Have you all

1263
00:58:55,420 --> 00:58:58,740
seen? It wasn't Falcon he was a little boy's name.

1264
00:58:58,740 --> 00:59:00,180
Well, same as metal.

1265
00:59:00,180 --> 00:59:07,100
There's a metal band. Dad is like making him do a metal band. Is it like

1266
00:59:07,100 --> 00:59:12,340
balloon boy feet? Yeah, they have a song. Yeah. Are you serious? They have

1267
00:59:12,340 --> 00:59:16,580
a song when I was all hoax or something like that. Like, yeah. You was a

1268
00:59:16,580 --> 00:59:21,580
called? Is that what that is? I think so. Fuck that's sick. That's so sick.

1269
00:59:21,580 --> 00:59:26,620
Flown away. The thing is if you have a kid and you name him Falcon E and you have to like expect that his

1270
00:59:26,620 --> 00:59:32,300
whole life is gonna be spent on balloons. This guy is either flying off in a balloon or like killing

1271
00:59:32,300 --> 00:59:37,300
John Penn. Those are the only options for somebody with that name dude. Yeah. Yeah.
