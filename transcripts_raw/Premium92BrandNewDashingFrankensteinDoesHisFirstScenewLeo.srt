Oh.

11
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:26,800
I didn't know he was in the call.

12
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:28,800
Yeah, you did.

13
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:31,800
Welcome back Leo, what's up? What's going on?

14
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:39,800
I'm good, I'm feeling good. I think my audio equipment is busted and I only just found out now.

15
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:42,800
So I don't know what I'm going to do. I think I'm going to be kicked out onto the street.

16
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:44,800
Yeah, get off the episode now.

17
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:46,800
Get the fuck out!

18
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:47,800
I'm sorry guys.

19
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:48,800
Get out.

20
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:50,800
Unless you cry and turn your video on.

21
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:52,800
Yeah, I will turn my video on.

22
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:57,800
Turn your video on and cry and maybe like squint like, whoa!

23
00:00:57,800 --> 00:00:58,800
Yeah.

24
00:00:58,800 --> 00:00:59,800
Holy shit.

25
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:03,960
You guys can't see this, but he's in outer space.

26
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:04,960
That's right.

27
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:05,960
Yeah.

28
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:08,760
Just, I was saving that for when the podcast started.

29
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:10,640
I really wanted to blow your minds.

30
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:11,640
It worked.

31
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:12,640
Yeah.

32
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:15,360
I thought that maybe you were so, I thought this is, this was crazy.

33
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:19,020
I thought you were so poor that you couldn't even afford a webcam.

34
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:22,080
Now I realize you're so rich that you're in space right now.

35
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:26,080
Well, I can't afford, I couldn't afford an astronaut suit, but they did just put me up

36
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:30,060
Which is nice of them. Yeah, I mean look at his shirt. He's so rich

37
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:33,360
That's true. I am wearing a

38
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:36,280
prisoner of war shirt right now

39
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:43,960
Heard they're making a sequel to boy in the striped pajamas

40
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:55,120
They're doing a crossover with the boy in the striped pajamas at ET

41
00:01:55,120 --> 00:02:02,120
This looks like Richard Branson going as a boy in the straight pajamas.

42
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:06,620
Just in space, shirt halfway buttoned, ready to have sex.

43
00:02:06,620 --> 00:02:08,120
You look good man.

44
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:09,120
Thanks man.

45
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:10,620
It's been a long time.

46
00:02:10,620 --> 00:02:17,120
I think actually there's a scrapped episode of your show that I was on because the audio.

47
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:18,120
Yeah.

48
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:19,120
What did you do?

49
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:21,120
Patrick said something really nasty.

50
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:24,960
Oh, I said a few pretty bad things about Inuits and um

51
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:31,440
The end of the cp, but no no, no, no, no, no. Yeah together in the same sentence

52
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:36,480
About both those things and found a way of intertwining them. It was really impressive

53
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:39,920
It was about it was about a half an hour of the podcast. They had to scrap it

54
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:42,320
but

55
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:44,740
Yeah, well it was it was a really re-recording

56
00:02:44,740 --> 00:02:48,400
It was a really impressive poem that he that he told

57
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:54,160
Yeah, he did a soliloquy. It was really great.

58
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:56,320
I've been getting into poetry.

59
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:57,280
No, you haven't.

60
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:58,000
No, you have not.

61
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:08,160
That's on the list of like 5,000 things you could tell me that you were starting to gain

62
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:10,000
interest in and I would just not believe you.

63
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,560
What's, say, with some other things? What are some other things?

64
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:16,560
Like vitamins? Like if you told me I'm taking vitamins every day.

65
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:18,560
I have been I have

66
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:31,440
What are you doing over there? Yeah, what is he what do you think he's gonna pull?

67
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:36,400
If you can't find them, you're clearly not into them because you're supposed to take them every day. I

68
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:42,080
Put them on the the thing at the foot of my bed my little like you're supposed to put them in your mouth

69
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:45,960
I kicked him off of my thing while I was asleep because I didn't take him today.

70
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:50,080
Were you sitting in your bed eating vitamins like chips?

71
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:51,080
Why were they in your bed?

72
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:55,080
On the foot of my bed!

73
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:56,760
Okay, let's see these vitamins.

74
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:58,080
Okay, yeah, show me, go ahead.

75
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:00,200
Okay, well, I can only find one.

76
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:01,200
It's my E3 supplements.

77
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:02,200
Okay, let's see here.

78
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:03,200
I don't see those.

79
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:04,200
E3, that's not real.

80
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:05,200
That's not a real vitamin.

81
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:06,200
Vitamin 3?

82
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:09,200
It's for, it supports immune health!

83
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:10,680
No.

84
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:11,680
for bone immunity?

85
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:12,680
Bone immunity?

86
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:13,680
Bone immunity?

87
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:14,680
You're immune from bones.

88
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:15,680
It's a division three.

89
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:16,680
Bone health.

90
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:17,680
Bone immunity.

91
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:18,680
There's an asterisk.

92
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:19,680
What does the asterisk go to?

93
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:20,680
The asterisk, um, let me actually see what that means.

94
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:21,680
It actually harms your bones.

95
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:22,680
This is actually candy.

96
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:23,680
Yeah.

97
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:24,680
Yeah, it's like candy cigarettes.

98
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:25,680
These statements have not been evaluated by the Food and Drug Administration.

99
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:26,680
All right, then, I don't count.

100
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:27,680
I don't count.

101
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:28,680
I don't count.

102
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:29,680
I don't count.

103
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:30,680
I don't count.

104
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:31,680
I don't count.

105
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:32,680
I don't count.

106
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:33,680
I don't count.

107
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:34,680
I don't count.

108
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:35,680
I don't count.

109
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:36,680
I don't count.

110
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:37,680
I don't count.

111
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:38,680
I don't count.

112
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:42,880
administration. All right then I don't count it because I go by the FDA on everything.

113
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:47,120
Are you kidding me? Those are vitamins to me. It says vitamin you know what I'm

114
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:50,540
gonna take three right now. Did you get those from like Info Wars or something? I got

115
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:55,280
these from Walgreens which is the same thing. Is that AlphaBrand? I'm gonna get

116
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:59,200
into that I think. I've been thinking about getting into nootropics because I am so

117
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:03,160
stupid that the only thing that could cure me is a pill. Yeah I would

118
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:07,640
like to get into those. My brother my younger brother had a thing that was

119
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:11,240
called like libido strength or something like that.

120
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:12,240
They always tie in.

121
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:14,680
Like testosterone like pills and I started taking them.

122
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:19,120
It's always like brain booster plus ball sack expander.

123
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:22,400
So you never get, you can never just get like it's good for your brain.

124
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:25,120
It always has to have something to do with your male penis.

125
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:27,560
It's true.

126
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:30,960
But I don't, I don't really, it's not that I don't need a bigger dick.

127
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:33,320
I definitely do, but I don't really want one.

128
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:38,200
I'm like content with how my shit looks.

129
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:39,200
Yeah?

130
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:40,200
Really?

131
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:41,200
That's how your shit looks?

132
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:42,200
That's good.

133
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:47,920
I saw a video the other day of a guy whose dick looked like if Bowser had a dick.

134
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:51,640
And I was like, that was the first time in a while where I was like, I wish I had that

135
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:52,640
guy's dick.

136
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:53,640
It had a turtle shell.

137
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:59,160
Well it was just like so, it looked like it was not green but it did look, it was like

138
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:00,160
all veins.

139
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:01,160
Oh, okay.

140
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:02,640
And like insanely hard.

141
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:05,840
It looked like a rhino's horn with a vein in it.

142
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:08,960
Alright, maybe if I saw that too I'd have the same reaction.

143
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:10,800
You'd be less content, yeah.

144
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:14,320
Yeah, but I think, you know, you can't really...

145
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:15,120
I do want one.

146
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:17,040
Wait, where did you see it?

147
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:19,680
Yeah, I saw it in a pornography video.

148
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:20,080
What do you mean?

149
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:21,040
Okay, that's cool.

150
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:23,280
But I didn't know if it was in person or something.

151
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:26,720
I saw it, did I not say a video?

152
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:29,600
Oh, through the lens, through the viewfinder you saw it.

153
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:32,000
Yeah, I was filming a pornography video.

154
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:39,400
And I saw this guy's dinosaur penis. Okay. I said that's pretty good man. Yeah, look more like a weapon

155
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:46,960
Then a play show you weren't just watching new grounds animated pool. I'm watching like a Mario theme. I'm not sure

156
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:51,760
I'm really not sure. Yeah, I have a hard time in Bowser. Yes, Ernie between

157
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:57,420
Yeah, my parents my parents caught me when I was a kid

158
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:06,020
Firstly my mom came in the room once and said can you stop googling naked celebrities on the family desktop but secondly,

159
00:07:06,020 --> 00:07:15,460
they found in my search history animated frankenstein porn that i was watching on youtube.

160
00:07:15,460 --> 00:07:18,360
That is the most british thing i've ever heard.

161
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:25,560
So here's what happened, it was an american production, they weren't talking in english accents, it was an american production.

162
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:30,120
Easily you probably you you probably have much more to do with it. But anyway, here's what happens in it

163
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:34,200
Or what I remember is it's uh, it's halloween themed first of all

164
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:39,400
A woman a nice sexual woman is uh opening her door and giving treats to people

165
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:43,720
And frankenstein it's actually frankenstein, but she thinks that he's

166
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:47,400
A trickle treater. So she's like, oh, would you want some candy and then he?

167
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:50,520
Sort of flips her around and uh has his way with her

168
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:56,360
Oh, Frankenstein flips a woman around and has his way with her.

169
00:07:56,360 --> 00:08:01,280
Yes. So I mean, that's I mean, he's evil.

170
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:04,200
Yeah, we knew that she likes it.

171
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:08,680
She likes, OK, well, the way that you just presented it did not sound

172
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:12,920
like it was, you know, kind of sounded like Frank, one of Frank

173
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:14,840
and his many crimes. Yeah, kind of.

174
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:17,080
She's kind of oblivious in it, if I remember correctly.

175
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:19,080
This wasn't I mean, this was a long time ago.

176
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:24,900
And also so she's still while she's getting fucked she still thinks like this is a little kid in green makeup

177
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:28,920
Presumably I know

178
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:32,160
Heroes in this story

179
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:38,280
I'm I searched Frankenstein porn. Okay. I found a video here on X videos called

180
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:41,040
Frankenstein's monster fucks like crazy

181
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:48,180
Whoa, well at least you know at least at least they're making the distinction that it is the monster and not the doctor

182
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:55,220
Yeah, that's true. It is true. Not too many people do that brand-new dashing Frankenstein does his first scene

183
00:08:55,220 --> 00:08:58,360
dashing Frankenstein

184
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:03,860
Is that like Frankenstein like shows up like is it more of a behind-the-scenes thing? I

185
00:09:03,860 --> 00:09:07,120
Don't know. I haven't watched I'm still super

186
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:11,720
Ever did the fuck to the monster. I mean, yeah

187
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:15,080
Okay, you have to right. Yeah, how would you not?

188
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:20,080
I mean, does doctor does the Frankenstein's monster have like an asshole and a dick?

189
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:24,400
Like why would he go through the yeah, give him an ass you just make him plain down there

190
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:27,800
Do you think like I feel like I would if I was him it would like yeah

191
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:33,380
It's also a lot of a bitch would be right away on women's doors and flipping them over and shit. Yeah

192
00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:35,880
Cuz why does he build?

193
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:40,400
Frankenstein it was to like reach something high on a shelf or something like I don't know

194
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:44,960
I thought he was building Frankenstein to like just prove that he could.

195
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:49,040
No, he's he's the one of the villagers actually came to his house the day

196
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:53,120
before he made Frankenstein and said you could never make a green guy.

197
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:55,120
Yeah, you'd right.

198
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:57,120
Yeah, blue guy maybe.

199
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:58,000
Red guy for sure.

200
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
You could never make a green guy.

201
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
The villager with knocked on the door.

202
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Villager knocked on the door. His blue guy answered.

203
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
And then got Dr. Frankenstein.

204
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
And said

205
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,000
He said, "I mean, I see that blue guy.

206
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,040
That, you know, anybody could do that shit.

207
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:14,360
But how about a green guy?

208
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:15,360
You know what?

209
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:16,360
There's lightning in there too.

210
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:17,680
I bet you can't add lightning somehow."

211
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:18,680
Fucking dare you.

212
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:24,520
You try to make a green guy with lightning, then come back to me.

213
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:26,560
You'll never make a guy with a flat head.

214
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:27,560
It wouldn't happen.

215
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:31,680
Yeah, why is his head flat?

216
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:33,560
That's just the head that they found at the graveyard.

217
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:35,720
Yeah, why does that guy's head look like that?

218
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:39,000
I bet you can't do anything with the two bolts I have in my back pocket.

219
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:45,200
Yeah, I bet you can't make a green guy with, hold on, let's see, toothpick, ball of lint,

220
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:46,200
yeah, and this shit.

221
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:48,200
And bolt of lightning.

222
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:50,880
Yeah, I dare you.

223
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:51,880
Yeah.

224
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:54,080
And what is the moral of Frankenstein?

225
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:55,240
It's like.

226
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:57,280
Is don't play God, that's the moral.

227
00:10:57,280 --> 00:10:58,280
Don't play God.

228
00:10:58,280 --> 00:10:59,280
Yeah.

229
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:00,280
Don't play.

230
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:03,280
Well, it's don't play God and then like.

231
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:07,280
The monster is actually nice is also one of the morals.

232
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:08,780
That's a nice moral.

233
00:11:08,780 --> 00:11:11,780
It's a good moral, yeah. It's very helpful in real life.

234
00:11:11,780 --> 00:11:16,280
Yeah, because any time that I've run into a monster before I've been attacked by them,

235
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:19,280
I thought, well maybe they might, they could be nice.

236
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:23,280
They could just be nice, yeah. I could be misinterpreting this whole situation.

237
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:29,780
I think it's good for if you run into Brett Garrett, it tells you how you should act.

238
00:11:29,780 --> 00:11:30,780
Yeah.

239
00:11:30,780 --> 00:11:31,780
True.

240
00:11:31,780 --> 00:11:38,860
If they do like a new reboot of Frankenstein, I bet that'd be the best guy.

241
00:11:38,860 --> 00:11:44,140
I bet Mary Shelley would feel so stupid about her moral of the monster actually being nice

242
00:11:44,140 --> 00:11:45,940
if she watched Alien.

243
00:11:45,940 --> 00:11:50,100
She'd be like, "Oh, I guess monsters are actually evil."

244
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:54,780
Yeah, she would sit there watching all these horror movies and be like, "Oh, well, maybe

245
00:11:54,780 --> 00:11:56,580
they're going to be nice to the-" Ah, fuck.

246
00:11:56,580 --> 00:11:59,260
Yeah, she's like, "Oh, I got it so wrong all along."

247
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:02,160
Jason, I mean this guy Jason, he's got to be nice at the end.

248
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:03,660
No, he's fucking easy.

249
00:12:03,660 --> 00:12:06,960
Maybe my moral is actually wrong all along.

250
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:08,960
Yeah, it's not a very good.

251
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:11,360
I don't think I don't think that is a moral that anyone should

252
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:11,960
live by.

253
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:15,460
Usually when you see a monster, they call them monsters for a

254
00:12:15,460 --> 00:12:15,960
reason.

255
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:16,660
Yeah.

256
00:12:16,660 --> 00:12:17,260
Yeah.

257
00:12:17,260 --> 00:12:17,760
Why?

258
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:19,960
Because of how monstrous they are.

259
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:21,360
Because that's what they're called.

260
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:22,960
Yeah, you wouldn't call it something else.

261
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:24,360
No, I do.

262
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:24,960
You know what?

263
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:27,060
Sometimes I call like moon.

264
00:12:27,060 --> 00:12:29,160
Yeah, moon, you know, you think it's a

265
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:31,160
Jamaican thing? Monsey?

266
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:33,160
It might be a Jamaican thing, yeah.

267
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:41,160
Oh. See, but you should, I mean like, they, it would be called a, like a, it'd be called a "nicester" if it was a good thing.

268
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:42,160
Yeah, a goodster.

269
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:44,160
A goodster.

270
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:46,160
A youngster if it's a young one.

271
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:48,160
Yep.

272
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:52,160
But the, not a monster, it doesn't make any fucking sense.

273
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:58,160
What about like a fucking friendster?

274
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:00,160
A fucking Friendster?

275
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:02,160
What?

276
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:05,160
The fucking is in there because I was trying to think.

277
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:11,160
I could see you ordering more vitamins on your computer screen and then being like, "I have to say something right now."

278
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:13,160
Faggin' Friendster.

279
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:17,160
What about a Rockstar?

280
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:18,160
Oh yeah.

281
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:19,160
Oh!

282
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:21,160
That is maybe the opposite of a monster.

283
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:24,160
And you know a lot of Rockstars end up being monsters.

284
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:27,760
stars. I was going to say the opposite. There's no rock stars

285
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:31,360
that are monsters. But then I remembered Kiss, which are all

286
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:34,720
there's a demon in that band. They are. Yeah, they're scary.

287
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:38,200
And like David Bowie, didn't he like fuck like 10 year olds all

288
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:40,040
the time or no, no, they were 14.

289
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:46,760
Yeah, he's not a monster. Wait a second. And David Bowie had a

290
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:52,480
lightning bolt on his face. Oh my god. He was in space. Oh my

291
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:54,980
God, wait a second, Leo.

292
00:13:54,980 --> 00:13:55,680
Wait a second.

293
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:56,580
Wait a second.

294
00:13:56,580 --> 00:14:00,780
He was the Goblin King in that labyrinth.

295
00:14:00,780 --> 00:14:03,880
Oh, yeah, a goblin is a monster.

296
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:06,180
He was bisexual.

297
00:14:06,180 --> 00:14:08,480
Oh my God.

298
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:11,680
We have him dead to rights fucking call the police right

299
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:12,080
now.

300
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:19,180
Yeah, we have to exhume him and put his bones in jail.

301
00:14:19,180 --> 00:14:21,780
I'm going to dump David Bowie's bones.

302
00:14:21,780 --> 00:14:22,780
it's not Linda Art.

303
00:14:22,780 --> 00:14:25,580
David Bowie's your- David Bowie, your bones are going to jail.

304
00:14:25,580 --> 00:14:28,320
That should be what happens if you find out that someone committed a crime and they're

305
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:32,580
already dead, they should dig up their bones and put them in a jail graveyard.

306
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:37,220
There should also be no trial, just the accusation should be enough because like, who cares if

307
00:14:37,220 --> 00:14:40,060
someone's bones are in jail, I don't give a fuck.

308
00:14:40,060 --> 00:14:41,060
You know?

309
00:14:41,060 --> 00:14:42,060
Yeah.

310
00:14:42,060 --> 00:14:45,920
Just as soon as somebody's accused of doing something evil if they're dead, just put those

311
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:46,920
damn bones in jail.

312
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:47,920
I don't want to see those bones.

313
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:49,920
Put those bones in jail!

314
00:14:49,920 --> 00:15:03,800
the

315
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:08,640
Complete brick wall and she worked for Adolf Hitler. Yeah. Yeah

316
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:13,180
Well, cuz it's problem with a lot of bodyguards is they got to jump in front of a bullet

317
00:15:13,180 --> 00:15:15,380
But like for a lot of bodyguards, right?

318
00:15:15,380 --> 00:15:22,060
They jump the bullet goes right to their right or left or like, you know between their arm and their torso still hits the fucking guy

319
00:15:22,060 --> 00:15:25,720
This bitch was I mean she was always in front of him

320
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:31,980
There was basically no angle that you could take on Adolf Hitler without using a cylinder without hitting my grandma mom

321
00:15:33,020 --> 00:15:37,340
Her CV looked so narrow in her hand, he just instantly hired her.

322
00:15:37,340 --> 00:15:41,340
Yeah, exactly.

323
00:15:41,340 --> 00:15:43,540
She was very flat from one angle though.

324
00:15:43,540 --> 00:15:48,700
Yeah, that was a really bad angle to bodyguard from.

325
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:51,620
But there was one part where it was like, you're not getting through her.

326
00:15:51,620 --> 00:15:53,540
Yeah, absolutely.

327
00:15:53,540 --> 00:15:57,700
I'm surprised there weren't more people trying to kill Hitler.

328
00:15:57,700 --> 00:16:00,540
You know that there's that movie, that Tom Cruise movie.

329
00:16:00,540 --> 00:16:01,540
Oh, Valkyrie.

330
00:16:01,540 --> 00:16:06,580
Where like some guy like they put a briefcase kind of near Hitler. It was under his desk, right?

331
00:16:06,580 --> 00:16:10,780
It was a desk bomb. It was it was a they had a conference table basically

332
00:16:10,780 --> 00:16:14,260
yeah, and he like yeah, he blew up all the wrong guys and

333
00:16:14,260 --> 00:16:21,380
Happened like a million more times, right? Yeah, why didn't anybody ever think like, oh, let's just lose a

334
00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:24,300
Guys like all the Jewish people

335
00:16:29,260 --> 00:16:32,500
Yeah, well it was it was like it was like Thanksgiving dinner

336
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:38,580
It was like Hitler and then a bunch of Jews and that's where he tried to do it didn't work out

337
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:46,300
It is yeah you'd day I feel like most people don't get tried to be killed that often

338
00:16:46,300 --> 00:16:50,540
Yeah, I mean no one's tried to kill Caleb yet, and I think you know

339
00:16:50,540 --> 00:16:56,260
Has anybody tried to kill any of you guys one guy a lot of people are after him

340
00:16:56,900 --> 00:17:02,660
That's one guy at a convenience store went like this to me is that why I be trying to be killed

341
00:17:02,660 --> 00:17:07,420
He's just did that to me. He did not do not he just looked at me and did that nothing. I

342
00:17:07,420 --> 00:17:09,860
Was that way?

343
00:17:09,860 --> 00:17:12,100
That was like a few years ago. It was okay

344
00:17:12,100 --> 00:17:18,040
I remember one time you telling me you thought it would be funny to look at people and just do that

345
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:23,900
Came from like a real story.

346
00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:25,900
I mean it's not really a story, he just did it.

347
00:17:25,900 --> 00:17:28,900
By the way, the thing I'm doing is drawing my finger across my throat.

348
00:17:28,900 --> 00:17:29,900
Yeah, as if you were.

349
00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:32,900
Like that universal gesture for "I'm going to kill you."

350
00:17:32,900 --> 00:17:33,400
Yeah.

351
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:35,900
But no, I didn't do anything. He didn't say anything to me either.

352
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:36,900
He just did that.

353
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:37,900
I was like, "Okay."

354
00:17:37,900 --> 00:17:39,900
And I bought the lighter I was buying and left.

355
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:42,900
One time me and Neil were, the guy threatened to kill us.

356
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:46,900
And he was like, but not like some homeless guy, he's like walking down the street.

357
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:50,900
"I'm gonna kill you. I'm gonna fucking kill you, but not here. Two blocks down from here."

358
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:53,900
And he was like, "Meet me there so I can fucking kill you."

359
00:17:53,900 --> 00:17:56,900
And we were like, "Yeah, man. We're headed that way too.

360
00:17:56,900 --> 00:18:00,900
But here. So we don't walk together. We'll go, we'll take a left at this block,

361
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:03,900
and then we'll like wrap back around and meet you there."

362
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:07,900
He was like, "Alright, cool. I'ma meet you there with all my friends and we're gonna fucking kill you."

363
00:18:07,900 --> 00:18:11,900
And then we just like went to like a bar instead.

364
00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:12,900
That's lucky.

365
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:13,900
I mean, yeah.

366
00:18:13,900 --> 00:18:15,900
A lucky break that he fell for that.

367
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:16,900
I would have gone.

368
00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:17,900
I mean, he's pretty stupid.

369
00:18:17,900 --> 00:18:21,460
Because like, why? I mean, I should have gone because there's no way that I just like get to that blog.

370
00:18:21,460 --> 00:18:26,660
He's like, OK, middle of downtown Boston, timed it for me and my friends to kill you right here.

371
00:18:26,660 --> 00:18:32,100
But yeah, I should have gone and two blocks away would have been like

372
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:35,580
it would have been the the corner of

373
00:18:35,580 --> 00:18:39,740
like the CVS on like the corner of Chinatown in Boston.

374
00:18:39,740 --> 00:18:42,540
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. So by the like the Duncan.

375
00:18:42,540 --> 00:18:44,860
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Leo knows.

376
00:18:44,860 --> 00:18:46,540
He knows all about this shit. I saw a guy.

377
00:18:46,540 --> 00:18:48,540
Oh wait, you've actually been to-

378
00:18:48,540 --> 00:18:51,540
Yeah, I've been to Boston, and I did go to a CVS in Boston.

379
00:18:51,540 --> 00:18:52,540
Oh shit.

380
00:18:52,540 --> 00:18:54,540
Which CVS? Oh, you know what? It was my fucking joke.

381
00:18:54,540 --> 00:18:56,540
It was that CVS actually, I think.

382
00:18:56,540 --> 00:18:57,540
Really? Oh, there you go.

383
00:18:57,540 --> 00:19:00,540
Yeah, because we did, we went to a cafe near there, so I bet it was that CVS.

384
00:19:00,540 --> 00:19:02,540
Yeah, I was the guy threatening Caleb.

385
00:19:02,540 --> 00:19:09,540
Oh, fuck.

386
00:19:09,540 --> 00:19:13,540
I waited for years, like Fry's dog in that Futurama episode.

387
00:19:15,540 --> 00:19:17,540
It was just as sad.

388
00:19:17,540 --> 00:19:20,540
That's why you are in the future right now in space.

389
00:19:20,540 --> 00:19:22,540
The rest of us are in now.

390
00:19:22,540 --> 00:19:23,540
Uh huh.

391
00:19:23,540 --> 00:19:26,540
I do miss Boston style homeless people.

392
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:27,540
Yeah.

393
00:19:27,540 --> 00:19:30,540
New York style is just, everybody's just tired.

394
00:19:30,540 --> 00:19:31,540
Yeah, it's true.

395
00:19:31,540 --> 00:19:32,540
They're sick.

396
00:19:32,540 --> 00:19:34,540
Yeah, not many inventors in New York.

397
00:19:34,540 --> 00:19:35,540
No.

398
00:19:35,540 --> 00:19:37,540
You don't get, there's no Sebulba.

399
00:19:37,540 --> 00:19:40,540
There's no like, nobody has like,

400
00:19:40,540 --> 00:19:42,540
nobody has like a,

401
00:19:42,540 --> 00:19:44,540
looks kind of normal and then like one day

402
00:19:44,540 --> 00:19:47,040
one day they pull up their leg and they have just like one.

403
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:47,840
Oh, yeah.

404
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:48,540
Yeah.

405
00:19:48,540 --> 00:19:49,340
Black leg.

406
00:19:49,340 --> 00:19:51,240
I think disease on their leg.

407
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:52,340
Yeah, it's cool.

408
00:19:52,340 --> 00:19:53,240
Remember that guy?

409
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:57,140
I mean, it's a perfect like just I remember all those guys.

410
00:19:57,140 --> 00:19:58,440
They were my best friends.

411
00:19:58,440 --> 00:19:59,340
Yeah, some of them.

412
00:19:59,340 --> 00:20:01,840
I gave fosters home for imaginary friends.

413
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:05,240
Is I gave a lot of those guys cigarettes many times.

414
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:07,640
I gave some points to a lot of something that'll kill them.

415
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:08,040
Great.

416
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:09,940
Yeah, I would give them hundred dollar bills.

417
00:20:09,940 --> 00:20:12,240
They didn't even you would not give them hundred dollar bills.

418
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:16,040
I'm getting one time I had to I told the guy with the with the evil leg

419
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:20,200
I told him I would buy him coffee and I came like I was like I have to go clock in to work

420
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:23,840
But I'll come back and buy you a coffee dude, and I came back and he was gone. It's like really man you

421
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:26,440
Couldn't wait what a jerk. Yeah

422
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:33,700
Some things can't wait man, yeah, he killed himself because he was like my best friend is

423
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:36,160
He was like I don't like coffee

424
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:38,680
And I got to get out of this somehow

425
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:40,920
Yeah

426
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:47,800
Now the like this yeah, it's just so you know, it's all just guys on beds here. It's not yeah, it's fun. It's not funny

427
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:51,800
Something funny like yeah, well like that's a post like mattresses

428
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:57,160
Mattresses is why else does a guy that's the point all over the city

429
00:20:57,160 --> 00:21:00,240
Make us all laugh really hard

430
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:03,800
Just guys are like beautiful king-sized beds

431
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:10,140
One of them one of I've talked to this before but one of the guys with the bed a block away from me

432
00:21:10,140 --> 00:21:15,380
There's like a little like underpass and he died, but his bed has been there for like six months.

433
00:21:15,380 --> 00:21:18,540
Nobody is like touching the bed out of reverence for him.

434
00:21:18,540 --> 00:21:24,620
He seems like a pretty good guy and people in the neighborhood would just like come and like talk to him and just sit in his bed with

435
00:21:24,620 --> 00:21:28,740
just talk to him.

436
00:21:28,740 --> 00:21:30,820
It's pretty awesome.

437
00:21:30,820 --> 00:21:33,220
And like read him stories like fairy tales.

438
00:21:33,220 --> 00:21:37,060
And he's fucking this is all like Polish and like Eastern European people here.

439
00:21:37,300 --> 00:21:40,820
And they just have the craziest street culture.

440
00:21:40,820 --> 00:21:49,020
They will just sit, you'll see two old ladies bump into each other and they're ready to actually fight each other.

441
00:21:49,020 --> 00:21:53,220
And then one of them will say a name and they realize they have the same granddaughter or something.

442
00:21:53,220 --> 00:21:55,700
And they'll just become best friends.

443
00:21:55,700 --> 00:21:59,380
Skid Row should just be one long bed with homeless people.

444
00:21:59,380 --> 00:22:00,260
Oh yeah, I agree.

445
00:22:00,260 --> 00:22:02,260
Like the Family and Jolly and the Chocolate Factory.

446
00:22:02,260 --> 00:22:02,820
Yeah.

447
00:22:02,820 --> 00:22:03,380
Yeah.

448
00:22:03,380 --> 00:22:03,860
Yeah.

449
00:22:03,860 --> 00:22:05,940
But Twice is damn lazy.

450
00:22:05,940 --> 00:22:12,260
That's right. Yeah, what would you guys do if you were the mayor of Los Angeles?

451
00:22:12,260 --> 00:22:14,580
How would you deal with the skid row problem?

452
00:22:14,580 --> 00:22:21,620
If I were mayor of Los Angeles, first thing I would do, give myself a star on the Walk of Fame.

453
00:22:21,620 --> 00:22:24,660
That is a good call for a first thing.

454
00:22:24,660 --> 00:22:25,940
Yeah. Yeah.

455
00:22:25,940 --> 00:22:29,700
First thing I would do is I would find a star and I'd spit on it.

456
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:32,340
It would say, Mayor Patrick.

457
00:22:32,340 --> 00:22:34,340
But you're not famous.

458
00:22:34,340 --> 00:22:36,340
It wouldn't just say the mayor.

459
00:22:36,340 --> 00:22:38,340
What would the icon say?

460
00:22:38,340 --> 00:22:42,340
They have a movie thing or a record based on what the person did on the star?

461
00:22:42,340 --> 00:22:44,340
What symbol would yours have?

462
00:22:44,340 --> 00:22:48,340
You should retroactively cast yourself in Vicky Cristina Barcelona

463
00:22:48,340 --> 00:22:52,340
so that you have the acting credit and then put the star on the Walk of Fame.

464
00:22:52,340 --> 00:22:54,340
Yeah, that's clever.

465
00:22:54,340 --> 00:22:56,340
That's a good idea.

466
00:22:56,340 --> 00:23:00,340
Cut yourself into Javier Bardem's parts in that movie.

467
00:23:00,340 --> 00:23:02,860
That's what I do.

468
00:23:02,860 --> 00:23:07,220
Just find like a guy with a mustache in the background of like an episode of Shameless

469
00:23:07,220 --> 00:23:08,540
and then just put that on the star.

470
00:23:08,540 --> 00:23:09,540
That was me.

471
00:23:09,540 --> 00:23:10,540
That was me.

472
00:23:10,540 --> 00:23:12,660
Okay, do you guys want to hear my solution to Skid Row problem?

473
00:23:12,660 --> 00:23:13,660
Yeah.

474
00:23:13,660 --> 00:23:14,660
Can I ask a question?

475
00:23:14,660 --> 00:23:15,660
What's the name?

476
00:23:15,660 --> 00:23:16,660
Well, first change the name.

477
00:23:16,660 --> 00:23:17,660
Skid Row.

478
00:23:17,660 --> 00:23:18,660
That's a good idea.

479
00:23:18,660 --> 00:23:19,660
It's called Skid Row.

480
00:23:19,660 --> 00:23:22,460
It's kind of a broken windows thing, right?

481
00:23:22,460 --> 00:23:23,460
Yeah.

482
00:23:23,460 --> 00:23:24,460
Okay.

483
00:23:24,460 --> 00:23:27,060
First thing I'm doing now, and just bear with me here.

484
00:23:27,060 --> 00:23:29,900
First thing I'm doing, the Oscars, they happen weekly.

485
00:23:29,900 --> 00:23:36,700
Yes. Okay. Okay. Second thing I'm doing no celebrities are allowed to come to the Oscars.

486
00:23:36,700 --> 00:23:42,660
Okay. Third thing I'm doing only homeless people at the Oscars. They can live in the Dolby

487
00:23:42,660 --> 00:23:48,420
Theater. They each get a chair and they're the whole audience. Okay. So here's a question

488
00:23:48,420 --> 00:23:55,740
homeless host or Jimmy Kimmel. Kim both. I mean both preferably at the same time. Jimmy

489
00:23:55,740 --> 00:23:59,180
Kimmel how about homeless writers but Jimmy Kimmel has to read what they wrote.

490
00:23:59,180 --> 00:24:02,780
I would like Jimmy Kimmel to be the host but I would also like him to be homeless.

491
00:24:02,780 --> 00:24:05,420
Exactly. He sees his house. Yeah exactly.

492
00:24:05,420 --> 00:24:09,500
My solution would be have you guys ever played Fallout 3?

493
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:13,340
Yeah. You know that thing Megaton? You know that city?

494
00:24:13,340 --> 00:24:15,340
Oh come on man. What?

495
00:24:15,340 --> 00:24:20,700
I already know where this is going. What do you mean? I don't know. I have no idea where this is

496
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:23,180
You know how you save the town?

497
00:24:23,180 --> 00:24:25,180
[Laughter]

498
00:24:25,180 --> 00:24:27,180
Yeah, I do that!

499
00:24:27,180 --> 00:24:29,180
[Laughter]

500
00:24:29,180 --> 00:24:31,180
Yeah.

501
00:24:31,180 --> 00:24:33,180
You guys know the Death Star?

502
00:24:33,180 --> 00:24:35,180
[Laughter]

503
00:24:35,180 --> 00:24:37,180
[Laughter]

504
00:24:37,180 --> 00:24:39,180
Yeah.

505
00:24:39,180 --> 00:24:41,180
You must be amazing to be the mayor of such a star-studded city.

506
00:24:41,180 --> 00:24:43,180
Have you guys ever seen Infinity War?

507
00:24:43,180 --> 00:24:45,180
[Laughter]

508
00:24:45,180 --> 00:24:47,180
You guys ever seen Saving Private Ryan?

509
00:24:47,180 --> 00:24:49,180
I basically want to do that to Skid Row.

510
00:24:49,180 --> 00:24:56,780
skid row. Yeah, there's a guy in skid row named Private Ryan. I have to save him. I have to

511
00:24:56,780 --> 00:25:00,980
save him real bad. You know what might be a good idea is give some like humongous tax

512
00:25:00,980 --> 00:25:07,820
credit to any film that is like filmed in skid row. So then you have all of these like

513
00:25:07,820 --> 00:25:12,660
actors who are doing they're playing like homeless people and they're trying to they'll

514
00:25:12,660 --> 00:25:16,380
do like the method thing so they spend like a month before they start shooting just living

515
00:25:16,380 --> 00:25:21,980
at Skid Row and then they all get like HIV from like dirty needles and then all the actors

516
00:25:21,980 --> 00:25:22,980
die.

517
00:25:22,980 --> 00:25:23,980
Right.

518
00:25:23,980 --> 00:25:24,980
What do you guys think of that?

519
00:25:24,980 --> 00:25:25,980
I don't know about that play.

520
00:25:25,980 --> 00:25:26,980
Yeah.

521
00:25:26,980 --> 00:25:29,980
It doesn't seem like it solves a lot.

522
00:25:29,980 --> 00:25:32,980
Well, the actors die.

523
00:25:32,980 --> 00:25:36,980
We kill all the actors.

524
00:25:36,980 --> 00:25:38,700
Seems like a roundabout way to do that.

525
00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:39,700
You could do that.

526
00:25:39,700 --> 00:25:41,260
Yeah, but then like you don't get in trouble.

527
00:25:41,260 --> 00:25:42,260
You just kill all that.

528
00:25:42,260 --> 00:25:43,260
You know, all the actors are dead.

529
00:25:43,260 --> 00:25:46,020
Now that you're saying we're not gonna get in trouble. Yeah

530
00:25:46,020 --> 00:25:52,100
That changes everything all the actors are dead cuz they they all died there

531
00:25:52,100 --> 00:25:56,300
Okay, I mean you have a better solution

532
00:25:56,300 --> 00:26:00,740
No, I I think I think your solution here is pretty good

533
00:26:00,740 --> 00:26:04,640
If you could be the mayor of one city in the world, what would it Boston?

534
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:11,000
You don't want to be the mayor boss. No, I don't know too hard many hard decisions

535
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,000
I don't want the city to be mad at me.

536
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,000
Atlantis, yeah?

537
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,000
Yeah, I was thinking Atlantis as well.

538
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,000
But Atlantis, like, just by becoming mayor,

539
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:23,000
first of all, how are you going to run when you can't even, like, breathe underwater?

540
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,000
That's going to be fucking tough, right?

541
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,000
Well, I can't.

542
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,000
Okay, let's just change it and stuff.

543
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,000
And Leo, I'm guessing you can too, if you want to.

544
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,000
I can breathe in space.

545
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,000
So, I don't think that translates.

546
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:39,000
I just generally can breathe anywhere, I think.

547
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:42,640
All right, so what would you guys do in Atlantis?

548
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:44,160
If you guys became mayor of Atlantis,

549
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:46,080
are you trying to like, would you,

550
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:47,720
the big infrastructure thing would be like--

551
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:49,720
- I'd move Skid Row to Atlantis.

552
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:52,320
I'd establish a sort of twin cities thing.

553
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:54,920
- Just drown 5,000 homeless people?

554
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:56,920
- No, we're just saying, look,

555
00:26:56,920 --> 00:26:58,480
don't worry about the specifics.

556
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:00,240
Don't worry about how it's gonna work.

557
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:05,040
We take a giant plane and fly it into the ocean

558
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:08,100
and it's full of Skid Row homeless people.

559
00:27:08,100 --> 00:27:12,100
And it comes down to Atlantis and then the plane lets him out.

560
00:27:12,100 --> 00:27:14,100
And then it's all good.

561
00:27:14,100 --> 00:27:19,100
Yep. We'll see what happens. It's an experimental policy.

562
00:27:19,100 --> 00:27:21,100
I mean, did you guys ever...

563
00:27:21,100 --> 00:27:26,100
You can't do it. You gotta do this shit before you find out it's a bad idea.

564
00:27:26,100 --> 00:27:28,100
Yeah, exactly. It's called experimenting.

565
00:27:28,100 --> 00:27:30,100
Thank you.

566
00:27:30,100 --> 00:27:34,100
The mayor in my hometown, he just lived in a normal house,

567
00:27:34,100 --> 00:27:37,100
which I always thought he would live in a palace or something.

568
00:27:37,100 --> 00:27:42,380
But he just lived in a normal house and he would mow his lawn and sometimes I would ride

569
00:27:42,380 --> 00:27:46,660
my bike by his lawn and he would scream at me if I touched his grass.

570
00:27:46,660 --> 00:27:49,340
He's a pretty cool guy.

571
00:27:49,340 --> 00:27:57,900
And in my brain, I know this is not his name, but I think his name was Bill de Blasio.

572
00:27:57,900 --> 00:27:58,900
I'm not kidding.

573
00:27:58,900 --> 00:28:03,500
Like anytime I think of the mayor of Wilmington, North Carolina, I'm like, "It's Bill de Blasio."

574
00:28:03,500 --> 00:28:05,860
I don't think it was Bill de Blasio.

575
00:28:05,860 --> 00:28:07,200
I think that's probably not his name.

576
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:13,720
Maybe his name, maybe one of his policies was building the Blasio in Wilmington.

577
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:15,880
Oh, I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

578
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:17,880
It's Bill Sappho.

579
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:19,880
Oh.

580
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:21,880
Which is, you know, pretty close, right?

581
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:23,880
Yeah, it's pretty similar.

582
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:28,680
Someone was running for mayor in my roommate's town called Nigel Diaper.

583
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:30,680
And that's real.

584
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:32,680
Wow. That is real?

585
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:34,680
Nigel Diaper? Diaper spelled like diaper?

586
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:36,680
D-I-A-P-E-R.

587
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:38,680
Wow.

588
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:40,680
I can't even imagine.

589
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:42,680
I don't know if I feel stupid for asking.

590
00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:44,680
Does he wear a diaper

591
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:46,680
all the time?

592
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:48,680
I don't know. It would be nice though with a giant

593
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:50,680
pin in it.

594
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:52,680
Like baby new year.

595
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:54,680
That would be a good look I think.

596
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:56,680
For the mayor.

597
00:28:56,680 --> 00:28:58,680
I'd vote for him.

598
00:28:58,680 --> 00:29:00,680
Definitely vote for somebody named Nigel Diaper.

599
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:02,680
Nigel Diaper is a

600
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:04,680
Is it you said he was a mayor?

601
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:10,440
He was running for running for running. Yeah. Absolutely. I mean, yeah, no, it doesn't merit mayor does not matter

602
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:15,640
Like I'm not doing my research for voting for mayor if I look at the ballot and I see a guy named Nigel diaper

603
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:20,040
Absolutely. Yeah funniest name is the only thing that you go for when you get into that position

604
00:29:20,040 --> 00:29:25,020
Yeah, that is why I voted for Jill Stein because I thought she was related to Frankenstein

605
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:33,920
Well, yeah, that's the thing is like mayor like what can a mayor really do besides like like I mean the worst

606
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:36,920
Thing he could do is like run with his big scissors

607
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:41,920
I feel like like there's not like a serious like thing that he can make happen in the town

608
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:47,780
Yeah, or if he's like is like snipping stuff. That's not the ribbon, you know, that would yeah

609
00:29:47,780 --> 00:29:51,380
That would could be problematic if he's maybe going around the city

610
00:29:51,380 --> 00:29:55,320
I guess it makes sense that people think that like the president is controlled by like an

611
00:29:55,840 --> 00:30:01,680
Illuminati style council because that is the way that every town in America is governed.

612
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:07,680
There's one guy who pretends he's in charge and then there's a bunch of 18 public school

613
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:13,480
teachers and guys who own Chick-fil-A's who vote on what actually happens in town.

614
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:16,840
Nobody knows who they are.

615
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:21,760
In your hometown, did they record all those meetings and play them on the public access

616
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:22,760
channel?

617
00:30:22,760 --> 00:30:23,760
No.

618
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:30,240
in Londonderry. Yeah, so you just like, channel like 21, like every night was like some school

619
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:36,880
board meeting. And it's just like, some kids fucking parents. And like, a guy who owns all of

620
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:46,240
the Tedeschi's in our town. Do you remember that video of that lady who, it's like a news story,

621
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:52,960
like a local news story. It's like, this brave woman. Oh, yeah. Attacked the would-be mass shooter

622
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:56,720
at this public, uh, this like, uh, city council meeting.

623
00:30:56,720 --> 00:31:00,480
And she, it's like this whole buildup where they interview her and they're like,

624
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:02,480
where'd you get the, have the bravery to do it?

625
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:04,560
And then they show the clip of her and she like,

626
00:31:04,560 --> 00:31:08,080
tries to tackle the guy and he just like throws her off to the ground.

627
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:08,560
Immediately.

628
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:10,800
The noise she makes is just like,

629
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:17,120
and then it's like, aren't you? Did you screaming? Yeah.

630
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:18,400
It's like a 15 minute video.

631
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:21,280
The first five minutes are setting this lady up as a hero.

632
00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:28,320
She immediately just like fucking falls over and the guy the the shooter feels so bad for her that he just lets her leave

633
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:29,760
Yeah

634
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:31,760
She comes back and tries it again

635
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:36,080
And the same thing happens

636
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:38,560
and then it ends with like the guy like like

637
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:44,720
He like, uh missed like of all his shots point blank on everybody and then that guy shot him in the head

638
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:49,680
Oh, my pretty it's a pretty amazing story. Yeah, I never heard of this. Yeah

639
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,800
somehow it should have been national news

640
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:55,400
where was that

641
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:56,040
i don't know

642
00:31:56,040 --> 00:31:58,400
uh... arkansas

643
00:31:58,400 --> 00:32:01,960
i don't fully using it should have been national news made me think that it was

644
00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:04,880
on inside it

645
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:09,000
so that i know i i think is i think like joshua to to me or something okay yeah

646
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,200
and i didn't like see it on my news

647
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:12,520
channel okay

648
00:32:12,520 --> 00:32:14,820
jimmy and jimmy

649
00:32:14,820 --> 00:32:16,820
No, it's Joe Mama.

650
00:32:16,820 --> 00:32:18,820
Oh my god.

651
00:32:18,820 --> 00:32:24,740
Oh yeah, you might want to stay in space after that one because if you come back down to

652
00:32:24,740 --> 00:32:27,540
earth people are going to be pointing and laughing at you like Ralph.

653
00:32:27,540 --> 00:32:28,540
Oh my god.

654
00:32:28,540 --> 00:32:29,540
Yeah, that's right.

655
00:32:29,540 --> 00:32:34,340
You got fucking kaboomed.

656
00:32:34,340 --> 00:32:35,340
So how have you been Leo?

657
00:32:35,340 --> 00:32:39,060
I've been alright.

658
00:32:39,060 --> 00:32:41,020
It's been a little sunny here.

659
00:32:41,020 --> 00:32:44,340
My parents are on holiday.

660
00:32:44,340 --> 00:32:53,780
It's your half birthday.

661
00:32:53,780 --> 00:32:54,820
That's just not true.

662
00:32:54,820 --> 00:32:57,660
My half birthday is September 24th.

663
00:32:57,660 --> 00:32:58,660
Is that true?

664
00:32:58,660 --> 00:32:59,660
No, I can't.

665
00:32:59,660 --> 00:33:00,660
I don't know how to do that math.

666
00:33:00,660 --> 00:33:01,660
You don't know?

667
00:33:01,660 --> 00:33:04,540
I don't know what my half birthday is.

668
00:33:04,540 --> 00:33:08,020
I'm guessing that's like kind of like, let's see.

669
00:33:08,020 --> 00:33:09,020
Did you make up the number?

670
00:33:09,020 --> 00:33:10,020
It would be October.

671
00:33:10,020 --> 00:33:11,020
It would be October.

672
00:33:11,020 --> 00:33:12,020
It would be somewhere in October.

673
00:33:12,020 --> 00:33:13,020
It would be October.

674
00:33:13,020 --> 00:33:14,020
No, nevermind.

675
00:33:14,020 --> 00:33:17,780
it would be did you guys ever like do the math and figure out when you were conceived?

676
00:33:17,780 --> 00:33:22,500
um no i just have a video no

677
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:27,700
i have a commemorative plaque

678
00:33:27,700 --> 00:33:34,980
no i mean i was born i was born 13 months after my older brother

679
00:33:34,980 --> 00:33:40,260
so i don't want to what does that mean or that means we're irish twins

680
00:33:41,620 --> 00:33:45,620
But what is 13 months? That's what my mom used to say growing up, was that my brother and I were Irish twins.

681
00:33:45,620 --> 00:33:49,620
13 months isn't how long it takes to have a baby though.

682
00:33:49,620 --> 00:33:53,620
Well that's how long I was in there.

683
00:33:53,620 --> 00:33:55,620
[Laughter]

684
00:33:55,620 --> 00:33:59,620
No, I guess my parents probably had sex somewhere in...

685
00:33:59,620 --> 00:34:03,620
Well, the thing, you look up Irish twins on Google,

686
00:34:03,620 --> 00:34:09,620
you look up Irish twins and it says that it's 12 months, so I missed the Irish twins by a month.

687
00:34:09,620 --> 00:34:11,620
and two days

688
00:34:11,620 --> 00:34:17,100
Unlucky I never even know my mom's a liar. So my mom's a fucking liar

689
00:34:17,100 --> 00:34:23,140
Yeah, what else is no is there a top result when I Google Irish twins? What are Irish twins and is the term offensive?

690
00:34:23,140 --> 00:34:26,580
Yeah, let me Google Irish twins real quick. I think

691
00:34:26,580 --> 00:34:33,060
I looked it up. It was all pictures of babies. Why are you saying Baba voom?

692
00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:38,660
Because maybe maybe it's tailored to my interest more this term was originally used as a derogatory

693
00:34:38,660 --> 00:34:44,280
Stereotype of Irish Catholic culture and therefore is inherently offensive don't care

694
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:47,120
It's I'm Irish. I don't give a shit

695
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:55,260
Nope, it's offensive. No Irish are in the world of people you can say anything about no matter what and also the Irish are the

696
00:34:55,260 --> 00:34:57,260
Polish of the

697
00:34:57,260 --> 00:34:59,260
UK world Oh

698
00:35:00,820 --> 00:35:03,300
Can you be mean to the Polish in Europe?

699
00:35:03,300 --> 00:35:11,180
Polish kind of occupy like Mexican status in the UK and that they're immigrants and I

700
00:35:11,180 --> 00:35:15,660
Like yeah, I like to keep the podcast moving by giving a serious answer to the things you

701
00:35:15,660 --> 00:35:22,740
But yeah like the whole like say something funny about the

702
00:35:22,740 --> 00:35:30,360
Really was like the 80s like it was all like because there's that style council song

703
00:35:30,360 --> 00:35:34,360
Is this how you're gonna relate to me as a human being?

704
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:35,360
Yes. Yeah.

705
00:35:35,360 --> 00:35:36,360
Okay.

706
00:35:36,360 --> 00:35:37,360
I'm gonna tell you about British stuff I know about.

707
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:40,360
I ate a jammy Dodger yesterday.

708
00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:41,360
Yeah.

709
00:35:41,360 --> 00:35:42,360
Think of that.

710
00:35:42,360 --> 00:35:46,000
Well, there's that Style Council song, the stand-up comedian's instructions, where it's

711
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,360
like, "Tell Irish jokes."

712
00:35:48,360 --> 00:35:53,600
And so I just assume that like, yeah, like the way that like the people in the US have

713
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:56,600
Polish jokes, like the UK has like Irish jokes.

714
00:35:56,600 --> 00:35:57,600
Is that right, Leo?

715
00:35:57,600 --> 00:35:58,600
I haven't heard.

716
00:35:58,600 --> 00:36:02,360
I haven't heard, I think my grandpa told me an Irish joke.

717
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:06,200
He also had a truncheon and started calling the neighbor's kid by my name.

718
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:08,700
So I don't know what like is a good example.

719
00:36:08,700 --> 00:36:12,600
[Laughter]

720
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:14,700
He kept it, yeah, he kept a truncheon by his bed.

721
00:36:14,700 --> 00:36:18,360
We don't really have like an analog for the Irish here though.

722
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:21,740
Because like we don't have, there's not like a group of people in the U.S.

723
00:36:21,740 --> 00:36:26,760
that we are like actively like have been at war with on and off kind of.

724
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:28,760
What are you talking about? Canada?

725
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:31,760
Well, but that's a different country, you know?

726
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:36,760
Because Ireland is all the UK and it is all Great Britain.

727
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:37,760
I guess Hawaii.

728
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:41,760
You guys know Hawaiian jokes? Those are so funny.

729
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:43,760
Telling Hawaiian jokes at a party.

730
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:45,760
Everyone's like, "What are you talking about?"

731
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:47,760
It's like, "Dude, what the f--?" Everyone just gets mad at you.

732
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:52,760
Everyone's confused, too. The jokes are just like...

733
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:53,760
I guess for a little bit.

734
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:56,840
Yeah, he saw a flower and said, "What's that, a necklace?"

735
00:36:56,840 --> 00:36:57,840
And it's like, "It doesn't...

736
00:36:57,840 --> 00:36:58,840
[laughter]

737
00:36:58,840 --> 00:36:59,840
...doesn't work."

738
00:36:59,840 --> 00:37:00,840
It's just all that.

739
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:03,840
He saw a coconut, said, "What's that, a damn bra?"

740
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:07,040
He saw some leaves and said, "That's a dress to me."

741
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:09,680
These damn Hawaiians, Jesus Christ.

742
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:15,040
I guess for a little bit, it was dumb blonde jokes.

743
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:17,800
Oh, dumb blondes are the Irish of America.

744
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:18,800
That's a really good point.

745
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:21,600
Yeah, we've been at war with them for years and years and years.

746
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:26,960
I mean everyone was mad at dumb blondes after that fucking weird guy in the 40s wanted everyone

747
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:27,960
to be blonde.

748
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:28,960
Yup.

749
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:29,960
Yeah.

750
00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:30,960
That's right.

751
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:31,960
Weirdo.

752
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:32,960
He was weird.

753
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:33,960
He was seriously strange.

754
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:34,960
Absolute freak.

755
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:35,960
So what did you do to be shot into space Leo?

756
00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:36,960
It must have been really, really bad.

757
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:37,960
No, it was really good.

758
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:38,960
Yeah.

759
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:39,960
I don't know.

760
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:40,960
I have terminal cancer and this was my wish.

761
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:41,960
So you were in the hospital for a while?

762
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:42,960
Yeah.

763
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:43,960
I was in the hospital for a while.

764
00:37:43,960 --> 00:37:44,960
I was in the hospital for a while.

765
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:45,960
I was in the hospital for a while.

766
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:46,960
I was in the hospital for a while.

767
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:47,960
I was in the hospital for a while.

768
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:48,960
I was in the hospital for a while.

769
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:49,960
I was in the hospital for a while.

770
00:37:49,960 --> 00:37:59,460
Yeah, to be sent up to meet E.T.

771
00:37:59,460 --> 00:38:00,960
My uncle knew a guy called E.T.

772
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:06,960
He didn't know a guy called E.T.

773
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:11,460
He knew a guy whose nickname at college was E.T. and it's because he had three testicles

774
00:38:11,460 --> 00:38:13,440
and it was E.T. the extra testicle.

775
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:15,440
Oh, that's actually pretty funny.

776
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:16,440
That's good, yeah.

777
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:21,400
demented grandfather who like you have two demented grandfathers yeah well

778
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:26,440
one of them is dead. The first guy I mentioned is in the ground you can accuse him of

779
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:31,000
anything and send him to bone jail. The other guy still alive wakes his wife up at

780
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:37,120
3 a.m. every morning to ask her what a computer is. He claims before he developed

781
00:38:37,120 --> 00:38:44,240
anything he he claims to have known a guy with five testicles. Five? And actually

782
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:49,200
My other grandpa, going back to the other grandpa, the dead guy, he knew a guy with two dicks.

783
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:56,000
I don't believe any of your crap. It doesn't matter where you don't know. There's guys with

784
00:38:56,000 --> 00:39:01,120
two dicks. And my grandma, who is alive, defends his honor and says, no, he did. He knew a man

785
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:07,840
with two penises. The the bi phallic dude. Yeah, that guy was that was a fraud. He's got fucking

786
00:39:07,840 --> 00:39:12,800
I seen the photos got two cops on his car. No, no, that guy was a fraud. Like, there's like,

787
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:21,040
a fraud? How is he a fraud? He was exposed. But what was he doing that was making it a

788
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:28,160
fraud? Like it's all photoshop. It was photoshopped? Yeah he was photoshopping two dicks on his

789
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:33,880
photos. I do think that there are biphallic people and maybe your grandfather did know

790
00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:39,440
a biphallic person. Yeah I mean you're participating in biphallic erasure right now. I don't care.

791
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:42,520
He said his name, he called him Double Ogan.

792
00:39:42,520 --> 00:39:43,520
It's Diefallia.

793
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:45,600
Diefallia, got it.

794
00:39:45,600 --> 00:39:46,600
Let me see some photos.

795
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:47,600
Oh my god!

796
00:39:47,600 --> 00:39:48,600
Oh my god!

797
00:39:48,600 --> 00:39:49,600
I saw the same!

798
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:50,600
I saw the same!

799
00:39:50,600 --> 00:39:51,600
Oh no!

800
00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:54,080
See the one that's on the Wikipedia page?

801
00:39:54,080 --> 00:39:55,080
That the one that you just saw?

802
00:39:55,080 --> 00:39:56,080
No, I'm gonna look at this one too though.

803
00:39:56,080 --> 00:39:57,080
You gotta look at that one.

804
00:39:57,080 --> 00:39:58,080
Oh god, what the fuck dude!

805
00:39:58,080 --> 00:39:59,080
None of these!

806
00:39:59,080 --> 00:40:01,080
The Wikipedia page is crazy!

807
00:40:01,080 --> 00:40:05,280
Okay, now there's no, I agree, there's no way that guy was telling the truth.

808
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:09,720
All these other people have like diarrhea and like big red lumps where there was...

809
00:40:09,720 --> 00:40:12,720
Yeah, this guy has, yeah, he has like an anglerfish lore.

810
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:18,100
Yeah, there's a guy on like Reddit who had like the Photoshop pictures of like his two

811
00:40:18,100 --> 00:40:19,880
dicks and then he just...

812
00:40:19,880 --> 00:40:20,880
You know who has...

813
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:23,000
He used that to promote his erotica that he would write.

814
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:25,840
You know which famous person has um, diphalia?

815
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:26,960
Who?

816
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:27,960
The Coen brothers.

817
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:28,960
Wow.

818
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:29,960
I never knew that.

819
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:32,360
(laughing)

820
00:40:32,360 --> 00:40:33,200
- Wow.

821
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:35,100
- I never knew that.

822
00:40:35,100 --> 00:40:35,920
- I didn't know that either.

823
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:36,760
- I didn't know that either.

824
00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:37,600
- I didn't know that either.

825
00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:39,520
- Yeah, I think,

826
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:43,680
I don't know that I would love that, having two dicks.

827
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:44,520
- Yeah.

828
00:40:44,520 --> 00:40:45,340
- Cry Fowl-ia.

829
00:40:45,340 --> 00:40:46,180
- It'll be all right.

830
00:40:46,180 --> 00:40:47,600
- Well, that's the thing, that's the thing.

831
00:40:47,600 --> 00:40:50,160
The photos that he would use is like,

832
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:57,400
it was like two dicks side by side.

833
00:40:57,400 --> 00:40:58,360
- Yeah. - Yeah.

834
00:40:58,360 --> 00:40:59,200
- Right.

835
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:05,800
is yeah and I mean you know I I believed it at first but now like looking at it

836
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:11,560
like real yeah it's uh you know first of all they were too big they were pretty

837
00:41:11,560 --> 00:41:16,200
imagine having diphalia and then like somebody's like we need to take a

838
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:21,800
picture of this for Wikipedia like you know I have a choice like we don't have

839
00:41:21,800 --> 00:41:26,240
a photo of it yeah I'm gonna believe that this is a real condition unless

840
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:32,680
But like cuz it so this guy if it was real he would have these fucking huge dicks in his pants all the time

841
00:41:32,680 --> 00:41:36,080
Yeah, no one sees one they go. That's cool

842
00:41:36,080 --> 00:41:38,800
But then they notice the other

843
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:45,820
Mm-hmm. They're gonna bring it up to you, right? Yeah, cuz like nobody knows that die fallia exists. So they're gonna be like, did you?

844
00:41:45,820 --> 00:41:50,600
What is there like a your dick and then like a poop in your pants that you have right next to it?

845
00:41:50,600 --> 00:41:54,800
Like why do you have yet? No things are you photoshopping this real life in front of me? Yeah

846
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:58,920
And then I think you have an answer because I'm not going to walk around telling people

847
00:41:58,920 --> 00:41:59,920
like, yeah, I got two cocks.

848
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:00,920
I have two cocks.

849
00:42:00,920 --> 00:42:01,920
I'm a two cock man.

850
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:02,920
Yeah.

851
00:42:02,920 --> 00:42:03,920
Call me Mr. Two cocks.

852
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:06,120
He goes, he goes by the double dick dude.

853
00:42:06,120 --> 00:42:10,840
Well, now if I had a name like that, instead of Mr. Two cocks, then maybe I would tell

854
00:42:10,840 --> 00:42:14,800
people I think double dick dude is one of the lamest names you could pick.

855
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:15,800
Right.

856
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:16,800
If you had two dicks.

857
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:17,800
Yeah.

858
00:42:17,800 --> 00:42:24,160
Triple D. And you know, it's like I'm getting like, I'm looking at all these pictures of

859
00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:27,760
this guy with his two penises. I'm just getting mad. I'm getting

860
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:32,640
mad because it's like he lied to me. Let me see these. Yeah,

861
00:42:32,640 --> 00:42:34,960
let's take a look. You know what I've been. I've been right

862
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:38,640
pissed off in a while. Let me double check this. Yeah. Okay.

863
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:44,160
Yeah. Yeah. This is absurd. I mean this is absurd. You would

864
00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:47,040
need to double check two penises. I don't think so.

865
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:49,920
Here's what he says frequently asked questions. Both are 100%

866
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:53,480
Functional number two. I did not absorb a twin

867
00:42:53,480 --> 00:42:58,640
You know, you know what the other thing too is it's it's photoshopped, right?

868
00:42:58,640 --> 00:43:04,880
So it's like that but then he also photoshops his asshole to be like completely like destroyed like go see

869
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:08,400
And it's like

870
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:15,520
Like dude, you've already like like it looks like the sarlacc pit like it's like you got like fucking like destroyed asshole

871
00:43:15,520 --> 00:43:20,200
that's like, you know, like hand big, like, like, like he's

872
00:43:20,200 --> 00:43:24,200
getting like, fucking punched in his asshole. And two dicks. It's

873
00:43:24,200 --> 00:43:25,800
like, it's disgusting.

874
00:43:25,800 --> 00:43:29,120
I have something fun here. He wrote a book.

875
00:43:29,120 --> 00:43:31,880
Yeah, the double dick dudes memoir.

876
00:43:31,880 --> 00:43:36,680
Double header, my life with two penises. And I'm on the Amazon

877
00:43:36,680 --> 00:43:42,800
page. And here's the top review of it. One star gross from Jill.

878
00:43:43,080 --> 00:43:47,880
This book was a little too raunchy for my taste and downright disgusting and sickening.

879
00:43:47,880 --> 00:43:50,360
I mean, a two liter in someone's ass?

880
00:43:50,360 --> 00:43:51,960
Right.

881
00:43:51,960 --> 00:44:02,840
It's messed up that he like, and he does, and he does like insertions into his penis and stuff.

882
00:44:02,840 --> 00:44:08,360
Like it's like, here's a review of three stars. He's for real. There has been a torrent of online

883
00:44:08,360 --> 00:44:11,720
chatter dismissing this as a hoax, but I don't see any reason to doubt what he said.

884
00:44:11,720 --> 00:44:12,280
Nah, that's him.

885
00:44:12,280 --> 00:44:16,880
The many photos available on Google Image are pretty convincing IMO, as is the consistency

886
00:44:16,880 --> 00:44:18,080
of his writings.

887
00:44:18,080 --> 00:44:21,560
Well-formed double penises have been described in the medical literature, but usually one

888
00:44:21,560 --> 00:44:22,600
was cut off.

889
00:44:22,600 --> 00:44:26,880
Like other reviewers, I liked best the autobiographical material in the early part of the book.

890
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:31,320
I could have done without the accounts of his sexual exploits and the FAQs that pad

891
00:44:31,320 --> 00:44:32,320
out the rest of the book.

892
00:44:32,320 --> 00:44:34,320
I think I might have to order this book.

893
00:44:34,320 --> 00:44:38,280
Yeah, let's do like a reading.

894
00:44:38,280 --> 00:44:43,080
it's not like even if it's fake it's not an uninteresting fictional tale. Right

895
00:44:43,080 --> 00:44:49,160
look at look at this one that I just sent. Okay what is this here? It's a photo?

896
00:44:49,160 --> 00:44:58,640
Mm-hmm. This is I'm guessing he wrote this on a whiteboard or a piece of paper

897
00:44:58,640 --> 00:45:01,640
Always remember you are special no matter what they say

898
00:45:01,640 --> 00:45:07,080
Yeah, that's beautiful

899
00:45:07,080 --> 00:45:11,940
There's a twist you guys are expecting to see his ruined holers two penises

900
00:45:11,940 --> 00:45:20,800
When you post it does is that yeah, and then someone responded you're so inspiring and with two dicks it makes you cool and expiring

901
00:45:20,800 --> 00:45:23,760
Very cool

902
00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:24,840
Yeah

903
00:45:24,840 --> 00:45:26,840
I'm just mad that he's a liar

904
00:45:27,160 --> 00:45:34,260
Yeah, me too. This is like it's like when you realize supersize me is all just like, you know, kind of nonsense

905
00:45:34,260 --> 00:45:37,120
Yeah, yeah, exactly like that

906
00:45:37,120 --> 00:45:41,280
That's the biggest disappointment about the guy who made supersize

907
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:46,000
I agree. I don't keep up with the news much

908
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:51,280
But I think it's just that he ate he ate only burgers the whole time when he knows damn well

909
00:45:51,280 --> 00:45:52,280
there's salads on that.

910
00:45:52,280 --> 00:45:53,280
McDonald's.

911
00:45:53,280 --> 00:45:54,280
It's still so funny.

912
00:45:54,280 --> 00:45:55,280
He's of Apple.

913
00:45:55,280 --> 00:45:57,280
He tried to do it again with with Chick-fil-a.

914
00:45:57,280 --> 00:45:58,280
Oh, yeah.

915
00:45:58,280 --> 00:46:01,000
No, but nobody's even heard of the fact that he made.

916
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:02,000
I did watch.

917
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:03,480
I did watch that movie though.

918
00:46:03,480 --> 00:46:04,480
You did.

919
00:46:04,480 --> 00:46:05,480
Yeah.

920
00:46:05,480 --> 00:46:06,480
Yeah.

921
00:46:06,480 --> 00:46:07,480
How was it?

922
00:46:07,480 --> 00:46:08,480
It's horrible.

923
00:46:08,480 --> 00:46:09,480
It's fucking horrible.

924
00:46:09,480 --> 00:46:11,720
So he that what's the the premise of that is he's trying to outdo Chick-fil-a.

925
00:46:11,720 --> 00:46:13,080
The premise is at first.

926
00:46:13,080 --> 00:46:17,520
He's like he's like he doesn't like just eat chicken every day for a month like the same.

927
00:46:17,520 --> 00:46:18,520
Yeah.

928
00:46:18,520 --> 00:46:22,980
is like, oh, like chicken and like health food at like at restaurants

929
00:46:22,980 --> 00:46:24,620
is like not actually healthy.

930
00:46:24,620 --> 00:46:29,220
And then he makes his own restaurant that like uses that same premise

931
00:46:29,220 --> 00:46:32,720
of like a fake health food, like Panera bread kind of thing.

932
00:46:32,720 --> 00:46:37,020
OK, who the fuck who the fuck is going to Panera like, oh, I'm healthy.

933
00:46:37,020 --> 00:46:38,780
Me, dude, a bread bowl.

934
00:46:38,780 --> 00:46:41,260
People got to be healthier than eating the plastic bowl.

935
00:46:41,260 --> 00:46:41,820
They give me.

936
00:46:41,820 --> 00:46:44,880
Yeah, that's true.

937
00:46:44,880 --> 00:46:46,480
You got me there.

938
00:46:47,920 --> 00:46:50,400
There's a review of, I'm just looking at reviews now,

939
00:46:50,400 --> 00:46:52,680
there's a review of Super Size Me Too Holy Chicken

940
00:46:52,680 --> 00:46:56,680
that starts with, with greetings again from the darkness.

941
00:46:56,680 --> 00:46:58,920
(laughing)

942
00:46:58,920 --> 00:47:05,440
The chicken conspiracy you never knew existed.

943
00:47:05,440 --> 00:47:09,440
- Someone told me, someone, it was Patches,

944
00:47:09,440 --> 00:47:11,360
just told me that it's $10,000

945
00:47:11,360 --> 00:47:13,040
to start a Chick-fil-A franchise.

946
00:47:13,040 --> 00:47:15,000
- Oh, what the fuck are we doing with this thing?

947
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:16,320
- Dude, that's exactly, I was like--

948
00:47:16,320 --> 00:47:17,520
- It would be so easy.

949
00:47:17,520 --> 00:47:19,840
We open up the Chick-fil-A in Boston.

950
00:47:19,840 --> 00:47:22,320
That's going to be the easiest money that anybody...

951
00:47:22,320 --> 00:47:25,280
Because I've never driven by a Chick-fil-A that didn't have like,

952
00:47:25,280 --> 00:47:29,760
like 13 year olds, like overworked, like breathing onto iPads,

953
00:47:29,760 --> 00:47:32,720
trying to take all the fucking orders that are lying around the block.

954
00:47:32,720 --> 00:47:36,000
Oh, it'd be really easy, especially around here where there isn't one.

955
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:37,920
People would go nuts for it.

956
00:47:37,920 --> 00:47:38,720
It's true.

957
00:47:38,720 --> 00:47:42,640
Oh, and then we could get like people to like protest it on the first day it opens.

958
00:47:42,640 --> 00:47:44,080
Yes, dude.

959
00:47:44,080 --> 00:47:46,320
Like we could get... Oh, fuck, dude.

960
00:47:46,320 --> 00:47:49,920
Do we have to become like super Christian?

961
00:47:49,920 --> 00:47:51,720
Can you do that? We will.

962
00:47:51,720 --> 00:47:52,460
Can you do it anyway?

963
00:47:52,460 --> 00:47:55,460
Just do it in like and I'm because I'm ready.

964
00:47:55,460 --> 00:47:57,120
Just build a house.

965
00:47:57,120 --> 00:47:58,260
Use it as a house.

966
00:47:58,260 --> 00:47:58,800
I'm ready.

967
00:47:58,800 --> 00:48:01,560
I just want to make a house.

968
00:48:01,560 --> 00:48:03,500
Just do that. Yeah.

969
00:48:03,500 --> 00:48:06,600
But apparently they like they get almost all the money,

970
00:48:06,600 --> 00:48:10,780
which is the kind of the back end of that, you know, like it's $10,000.

971
00:48:10,780 --> 00:48:13,140
But they get all the money actually.

972
00:48:13,140 --> 00:48:15,440
And you just you just you get all the chicken.

973
00:48:15,780 --> 00:48:18,380
But you get all the glory of a chick-fil-a.

974
00:48:18,380 --> 00:48:19,480
It's true. Yeah.

975
00:48:19,480 --> 00:48:22,180
Open get one in the in the middle of the Mojave Desert.

976
00:48:22,180 --> 00:48:23,980
Yeah. It's air conditioned.

977
00:48:23,980 --> 00:48:25,660
You live there. It's nice.

978
00:48:25,660 --> 00:48:27,860
Don't worry about free food and water.

979
00:48:27,860 --> 00:48:31,200
Yeah. You know, and then when they ask her, like, we want our

980
00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:34,560
we want our 90% of the profits, you say, OK, yeah, here's a dollar.

981
00:48:34,560 --> 00:48:35,640
You fucking idiot.

982
00:48:35,640 --> 00:48:37,640
Yeah. Yeah. Thanks for all the free chicken.

983
00:48:37,640 --> 00:48:39,400
Thanks for the free chicken in the building.

984
00:48:39,400 --> 00:48:39,840
And guess what?

985
00:48:39,840 --> 00:48:42,540
It only cost me $10,000 and I have to live in the desert now.

986
00:48:42,540 --> 00:48:46,040
So look who has chicken on their face.

987
00:48:46,040 --> 00:48:47,340
Yeah, you could do it.

988
00:48:47,340 --> 00:48:50,740
You could if you if for example, if somebody if you really want

989
00:48:50,740 --> 00:48:54,240
someone's house, but they won't move you can open one in their

990
00:48:54,240 --> 00:48:55,840
house true.

991
00:48:55,840 --> 00:48:57,440
This in their living room.

992
00:48:57,440 --> 00:48:59,940
They can't do anything about it because you paid the money.

993
00:48:59,940 --> 00:49:04,240
So Chick-fil-a is this kind of eerie thing where they have like

994
00:49:04,240 --> 00:49:08,240
they've like captured what is nice about like old Southern

995
00:49:08,240 --> 00:49:12,440
ladies and they have like brainwashed and trained all their

996
00:49:12,440 --> 00:49:14,040
employees to act like that.

997
00:49:14,040 --> 00:49:16,780
So you'll have like a 17 year old who will be like,

998
00:49:16,780 --> 00:49:18,920
what can I get you today, darling?

999
00:49:18,920 --> 00:49:20,380
And it's like, what the fuck?

1000
00:49:20,380 --> 00:49:21,760
It's fucking weird, man.

1001
00:49:21,760 --> 00:49:25,360
Like you're just, there's like, you're acting like an old lady.

1002
00:49:25,360 --> 00:49:27,300
They're all sitting on rocking chairs.

1003
00:49:27,300 --> 00:49:27,840
Yeah.

1004
00:49:27,840 --> 00:49:30,020
They knit in between customers.

1005
00:49:30,020 --> 00:49:32,120
It's not a good environment.

1006
00:49:32,120 --> 00:49:37,400
And if you don't say my pleasure, when someone says thank you, they actually fire

1007
00:49:37,400 --> 00:49:37,640
you.

1008
00:49:37,640 --> 00:49:38,640
Really?

1009
00:49:38,640 --> 00:49:38,840
Yeah.

1010
00:49:38,840 --> 00:49:39,120
Yeah.

1011
00:49:39,120 --> 00:49:46,160
I know someone who was fired because they I think like five times their manager heard them not say it is

1012
00:49:46,160 --> 00:49:49,640
It's so funny that like we're just saying my pleasure

1013
00:49:49,640 --> 00:49:54,620
Really weird. You pleasured me. Thank you. Thank you for my pleasure. You just

1014
00:49:54,620 --> 00:50:00,840
Here's your food. It's like you get pulled aside cuz you keep saying shit like that. It's like that

1015
00:50:00,840 --> 00:50:07,080
Yeah, yeah. Hey, thanks for the chicken. That was mighty pleasurable for me friend. Oh, you pleasured me

1016
00:50:07,080 --> 00:50:08,760
You pleasured me hard.

1017
00:50:08,760 --> 00:50:09,760
Hey, come on.

1018
00:50:09,760 --> 00:50:15,240
Like, you're technically saying it, but you're creeping them out.

1019
00:50:15,240 --> 00:50:17,240
Yeah, just getting right up in your manager's face.

1020
00:50:17,240 --> 00:50:18,240
"What?

1021
00:50:18,240 --> 00:50:19,240
Fucking do something.

1022
00:50:19,240 --> 00:50:20,240
Fucking do something."

1023
00:50:20,240 --> 00:50:26,000
Yeah, it is funny how off-putting it is.

1024
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:30,280
I was in Atlanta recently, how off-putting it is to me as a guy from Boston to walk around

1025
00:50:30,280 --> 00:50:32,680
and people go like, "Hi there."

1026
00:50:32,680 --> 00:50:36,000
And I'm just like, "What are you doing?

1027
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:38,400
Look at me, leave me alone.

1028
00:50:38,400 --> 00:50:40,080
Even even in like,

1029
00:50:40,080 --> 00:50:45,280
like, like my I'll go visit my parents

1030
00:50:45,280 --> 00:50:48,760
and like if any of their like neighbors like wave at me, I get so mad.

1031
00:50:48,760 --> 00:50:50,000
Because I'm like, what the fuck are you doing?

1032
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:52,600
Like, don't like neighbors are different, though, in the south.

1033
00:50:52,600 --> 00:50:53,120
It really is.

1034
00:50:53,120 --> 00:50:54,520
So this is random people.

1035
00:50:54,520 --> 00:50:55,720
You walk by an old man.

1036
00:50:55,720 --> 00:50:56,520
How are you doing?

1037
00:50:56,520 --> 00:50:59,240
You walk by an old man on the street who's just looking directly

1038
00:50:59,240 --> 00:51:01,080
into the sun and smiling.

1039
00:51:01,080 --> 00:51:04,000
And you walk by and we'll be like, beautiful day out.

1040
00:51:04,240 --> 00:51:06,000
Yeah, get the fuck out of my face.

1041
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:11,520
Exactly. Yeah. Yeah. Like, what are you doing? Yeah. Like, I, we, there was like a, a guy,

1042
00:51:11,520 --> 00:51:14,720
like a security guard who was standing outside a bank or something. And he was like,

1043
00:51:14,720 --> 00:51:20,080
like, Hey guys, like, how are you doing? I was like, I'm not going into the bank. Don't talk to

1044
00:51:20,080 --> 00:51:26,880
me. I, I would say Boston is the least personable city in that way. New York, there's a lot more

1045
00:51:26,880 --> 00:51:31,520
people who would just talk to you on the street. That's my, that's what I always explain is as the,

1046
00:51:31,520 --> 00:51:46,520
the

1047
00:51:46,520 --> 00:51:48,040
lot of really mean stuff to you.

1048
00:51:48,040 --> 00:51:49,840
Yeah, they'll kill you, dude.

1049
00:51:49,840 --> 00:51:50,640
It's awesome.

1050
00:51:50,640 --> 00:51:52,120
I love the city.

1051
00:51:52,120 --> 00:51:53,800
Do it's the best.

1052
00:51:53,800 --> 00:51:54,520
Where do you live?

1053
00:51:54,520 --> 00:51:55,440
Now?

1054
00:51:55,440 --> 00:51:56,000
What city?

1055
00:51:56,000 --> 00:52:00,440
I live in East Anglia, a city called Norwich, small to midsize.

1056
00:52:00,440 --> 00:52:03,200
You know, we got some where you live in Norwich.

1057
00:52:03,200 --> 00:52:05,040
There's a puppet theater.

1058
00:52:05,040 --> 00:52:06,680
I was a theater.

1059
00:52:06,680 --> 00:52:08,600
I was just about to ask you what to do.

1060
00:52:08,600 --> 00:52:11,840
And I'm just going to ask if there was a puppet theater.

1061
00:52:11,840 --> 00:52:14,640
I'm telling you, you live in the Alan Partridge city.

1062
00:52:14,920 --> 00:52:16,920
I do, I live in the Alan Partridge thing.

1063
00:52:16,920 --> 00:52:18,920
Ask a British guy what there is to do.

1064
00:52:18,920 --> 00:52:20,920
Is there any nightlife in your city?

1065
00:52:20,920 --> 00:52:22,920
Yeah, there's a puppet theatre.

1066
00:52:22,920 --> 00:52:24,920
Yeah man, come over.

1067
00:52:24,920 --> 00:52:26,920
Yeah. You guys should do a tour.

1068
00:52:26,920 --> 00:52:30,920
Do you ever go see the statue of him there?

1069
00:52:30,920 --> 00:52:32,920
I wasn't aware of that.

1070
00:52:32,920 --> 00:52:35,920
Oh yeah, there's an Alan Partridge statue in Norwich.

Excellent.

So they got a kid...

1091
00:53:29,280 --> 00:53:31,280
That's even better than it was Sundays.

1092
00:53:31,280 --> 00:53:33,280
I thought they just kept it up!

1093
00:53:33,280 --> 00:53:37,280
That it was real but they took it down to prove Patrick wrong.

1094
00:53:37,280 --> 00:53:39,280
*laughter*

1095
00:53:39,280 --> 00:53:41,280
yeah

1096
00:53:41,280 --> 00:53:43,280
I mean, you know, the troubles are still happening

1097
00:53:43,280 --> 00:53:45,280
*laughter*

1098
00:53:45,280 --> 00:53:47,280
I can't believe my countdown worked

1099
00:53:47,280 --> 00:53:49,280
It did

1100
00:53:49,280 --> 00:53:51,280
We didn't quite get to

1101
00:53:51,280 --> 00:53:53,280
Yeah, I'll go check that statue out, thanks

1102
00:53:53,280 --> 00:53:55,280
You'll have to find what kind of

1103
00:53:55,280 --> 00:53:57,280
Indiana Jones giant werewolf

1104
00:53:57,280 --> 00:53:59,280
Was it an ice sculpture maybe?

1105
00:53:59,280 --> 00:54:01,280
No, no, it was a bronze statue

1106
00:54:01,280 --> 00:54:03,280
It was a bronze statue

1107
00:54:03,280 --> 00:54:05,280
The statue will be on display until Sunday when it melts

1108
00:54:05,280 --> 00:54:11,520
*laughter*

1109
00:54:11,520 --> 00:54:12,480
Oh fuck.

1110
00:54:12,480 --> 00:54:16,720
Man, I- I- I'd straight up just believe that that would stay there.

1111
00:54:16,720 --> 00:54:17,220
*laughter*

1112
00:54:17,220 --> 00:54:20,480
Like, I like heard about it and I was like, "Oh, that's gonna be there forever!"

1113
00:54:20,480 --> 00:54:21,440
*laughter*

1114
00:54:21,440 --> 00:54:24,560
Is Steve Coogan from, uh...

1115
00:54:24,560 --> 00:54:27,760
No, but at- no, Alan Partridge takes place there.

1116
00:54:27,760 --> 00:54:29,760
Oh, okay.

1117
00:54:29,760 --> 00:54:32,960
Or, yeah, he like moves there. I forget the fucking story.

1118
00:54:32,960 --> 00:54:35,720
The joke is that it's not a very sort of showbiz city.

1119
00:54:35,720 --> 00:54:37,960
It's very small and there's not much to do.

1120
00:54:37,960 --> 00:54:40,660
So it's funny that he's like a local celebrity there.

1121
00:54:40,660 --> 00:54:43,260
I decided just like Leo.

1122
00:54:43,260 --> 00:54:45,260
Yeah. Yeah. Do you get high five?

1123
00:54:45,260 --> 00:54:46,740
I'm trying to put it on the map, man.

1124
00:54:46,740 --> 00:54:49,200
I hope people come visit, huh?

1125
00:54:49,200 --> 00:54:50,440
We should come visit Norwich.

1126
00:54:50,440 --> 00:54:51,000
I would love to.

1127
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:54,880
I've never left this country and I don't have much interest in the UK.

1128
00:54:54,880 --> 00:54:56,980
I destroy it.

1129
00:54:56,980 --> 00:54:59,320
Oh, come on. Don't do that.

1130
00:54:59,320 --> 00:55:02,620
Yeah, no. Yeah, I'd probably I would actually love to visit Norwich

1131
00:55:02,620 --> 00:55:08,220
like the rest of the UK you gotta blow it up with a bomb. Yeah.

1132
00:55:08,220 --> 00:55:13,180
Yeah. And then we like go to like actually fly out and then like Kostjam

1133
00:55:13,180 --> 00:55:19,580
just plays this episode. Yeah. Yeah I would love to come to Norwich.

1134
00:55:19,580 --> 00:55:27,100
Norwich. Norwich. Norwich. Norwich. Norwich.

1135
00:55:27,100 --> 00:55:29,500
Oh, hey, welcome to Norwich, I'm Leo.

1136
00:55:29,500 --> 00:55:31,500
How are you?

1137
00:55:31,500 --> 00:55:34,300
Oh, I've got a pot of jelly eels going.

1138
00:55:34,300 --> 00:55:37,900
It would be funny if like, like kind of like shallow Hal style,

1139
00:55:37,900 --> 00:55:42,600
like Leo thought that he was like this like, this like nice young British guy,

1140
00:55:42,600 --> 00:55:46,300
like talked like he, like he does talk, but we all saw him as like Hagrid.

1141
00:55:46,300 --> 00:55:49,100
[Laughter]

1142
00:55:49,100 --> 00:55:50,100
I'd enjoy it.

1143
00:55:50,100 --> 00:55:52,100
Yeah.

1144
00:55:52,100 --> 00:56:00,100
Yeah, I've just got like a force field of like people getting out of my way in the street

1145
00:56:00,100 --> 00:56:02,100
and I'm like, "Oh, that's unusual."

1146
00:56:02,100 --> 00:56:03,100
Yeah.

1147
00:56:03,100 --> 00:56:04,100
Stink.

1148
00:56:04,100 --> 00:56:06,460
You stink and you're a huge ogre, man.

1149
00:56:06,460 --> 00:56:09,980
I feel like you must see at least one Hagrid a day.

1150
00:56:09,980 --> 00:56:13,540
There has to be real life Hagrid's in that part of the country, right?

1151
00:56:13,540 --> 00:56:14,540
There's a couple of Hagrid's.

1152
00:56:14,540 --> 00:56:15,540
Yeah?

1153
00:56:15,540 --> 00:56:16,540
Yeah, yeah.

1154
00:56:16,540 --> 00:56:17,540
Everyone knows Hagrid's.

1155
00:56:17,540 --> 00:56:18,540
People being coaxed.

1156
00:56:18,540 --> 00:56:19,540
Yeah.

1157
00:56:19,540 --> 00:56:20,540
Do you guys...

1158
00:56:20,540 --> 00:56:22,540
A couple of haggers, a couple of dobbies.

1159
00:56:22,540 --> 00:56:25,540
Like Chavs are your rednecks, right?

1160
00:56:25,540 --> 00:56:29,540
Uh, kinda.

1161
00:56:29,540 --> 00:56:31,540
I thought they were like Jersey Shore style.

1162
00:56:31,540 --> 00:56:36,540
Yeah, Jersey, yeah. They're like the guidos of like the UK.

1163
00:56:36,540 --> 00:56:40,540
Rednecks, I don't know, rednecks is like rural.

1164
00:56:40,540 --> 00:56:42,540
I don't know what our equivalent of that is.

1165
00:56:42,540 --> 00:56:45,540
I guess you guys just don't have a word for your rednecks, huh?

1166
00:56:45,540 --> 00:56:49,540
I guess. Maybe we just don't have that type of guy.

1167
00:56:49,540 --> 00:57:01,980
the

1168
00:57:01,980 --> 00:57:07,820
rednecks would be like serfs or like yeah like peasants that have like they wear like burlap

1169
00:57:07,820 --> 00:57:11,420
sacks and have like bowl cuts.

1170
00:57:11,420 --> 00:57:12,420
Bowl cuts?

1171
00:57:12,420 --> 00:57:13,420
Yeah.

1172
00:57:13,420 --> 00:57:14,420
Oh my.

1173
00:57:14,420 --> 00:57:17,140
Men who wallow in mud outside the castle.

1174
00:57:17,140 --> 00:57:18,140
Yeah.

1175
00:57:18,140 --> 00:57:19,140
Yeah that's alright.

1176
00:57:19,140 --> 00:57:22,780
They're called they're called the moatmen and that's their they live in the queen's

1177
00:57:22,780 --> 00:57:25,500
moat and the queen of whatever town.

1178
00:57:25,500 --> 00:57:27,900
No they're happy they know that place.

1179
00:57:27,900 --> 00:57:28,900
Yeah.

1180
00:57:28,900 --> 00:57:31,940
Oh yeah what what's it is the queen?

1181
00:57:31,940 --> 00:57:38,840
I really didn't want this episode just to turn it on like you're like the foreign

1182
00:57:38,840 --> 00:57:53,120
kid in school like like like years and it's still like so what is a banger and

1183
00:57:53,120 --> 00:58:11,740
and

1184
00:58:11,740 --> 00:58:12,740
I'm gonna do banger and mash.

1185
00:58:12,740 --> 00:58:14,240
I'm gonna do a banger and mash.

1186
00:58:14,240 --> 00:58:16,240
It's not something you order, it's something you do.

1187
00:58:16,240 --> 00:58:16,740
Yeah.

1188
00:58:16,740 --> 00:58:18,740
Would you like to banger and mash with me?

1189
00:58:18,740 --> 00:58:19,240
Yeah.

1190
00:58:19,240 --> 00:58:20,240
[Laughter]

1191
00:58:20,240 --> 00:58:20,740
C.

1192
00:58:20,740 --> 00:58:21,740
Yes.

1193
00:58:21,740 --> 00:58:22,740
I would.

1194
00:58:22,740 --> 00:58:23,740
Yeah.

1195
00:58:23,740 --> 00:58:29,340
When I come to America and I don't, if I'm not visiting any of the major cities, which

1196
00:58:29,340 --> 00:58:30,340
one do I go to?

1197
00:58:30,340 --> 00:58:31,340
What's the one I should?

1198
00:58:31,340 --> 00:58:32,740
What do you consider the major cities?

1199
00:58:32,740 --> 00:58:33,740
Oh, you know.

1200
00:58:33,740 --> 00:58:34,740
Morocco.

1201
00:58:34,740 --> 00:58:35,740
Albuquerque.

1202
00:58:35,740 --> 00:58:36,740
[Laughter]

1203
00:58:36,740 --> 00:58:40,740
I will say, Bakersfield, California.

1204
00:58:40,740 --> 00:58:41,640
be on your list.

1205
00:58:41,640 --> 00:58:43,440
Yeah, yeah, 'cause it's just

1206
00:58:43,440 --> 00:58:45,540
and not not because it's the best city.

1207
00:58:45,540 --> 00:58:47,040
It's probably the third best,

1208
00:58:47,040 --> 00:58:50,940
but because it's just something you'll never get in the UK.

1209
00:58:50,940 --> 00:58:51,240
It is.

1210
00:58:51,240 --> 00:58:55,340
You ever see like a like an English experience.

1211
00:58:55,340 --> 00:58:56,740
Yeah, like, you know what?

1212
00:58:56,740 --> 00:59:00,140
You know, he's got to go to like like if not Bakersfield.

1213
00:59:00,140 --> 00:59:01,040
You have a go on.

1214
00:59:01,040 --> 00:59:01,440
Sorry.

1215
00:59:01,440 --> 00:59:03,640
It looks like the cover of like Dune.

1216
00:59:03,640 --> 00:59:06,640
If you like photoshopped a bunch of like oil derricks all over

1217
00:59:06,640 --> 00:59:08,440
it. It's a perfect fucking place.

1218
00:59:08,440 --> 00:59:15,120
I think the perfect tour for Leo is like flies all the way like UK to like the Manchester

1219
00:59:15,120 --> 00:59:17,200
airport in New Hampshire.

1220
00:59:17,200 --> 00:59:21,040
We had this conversation last, one of the last premium episode Pat when you weren't

1221
00:59:21,040 --> 00:59:22,920
here we listed all the shitty cities.

1222
00:59:22,920 --> 00:59:23,920
All the best cities.

1223
00:59:23,920 --> 00:59:24,920
Oh really?

1224
00:59:24,920 --> 00:59:29,360
Yeah all the best cities sorry Manchester, Bakersfield, Gary, Indiana.

1225
00:59:29,360 --> 00:59:32,560
Yeah see I was going to say somewhere in like fucking Indiana.

1226
00:59:32,560 --> 00:59:34,320
Yeah definitely Gary.

1227
00:59:34,320 --> 00:59:37,280
I mean, you you went you lived in like Seattle for a little bit

1228
00:59:37,280 --> 00:59:38,640
and like in now, Indiana is not close.

1229
00:59:38,640 --> 00:59:40,640
I have been to Springfield, Massachusetts.

1230
00:59:40,640 --> 00:59:43,600
That was a oh yeah, that's another bad one.

1231
00:59:43,600 --> 00:59:45,680
Yeah, yeah, yeah, that was bad.

1232
00:59:45,680 --> 00:59:47,840
Check out definitely Lowell.

1233
00:59:47,840 --> 00:59:48,880
If you come back to mass.

1234
00:59:48,880 --> 00:59:50,480
Oh, yeah, I know.

1235
00:59:50,480 --> 00:59:51,280
Lowell rocks.

1236
00:59:51,280 --> 00:59:54,080
I love the great part about Massachusetts is like literally

1237
00:59:54,080 --> 00:59:59,200
every part of Massachusetts except Boston can be included in that list.

1238
00:59:59,200 --> 01:00:02,720
Yeah, no, I said, dude, not not the not the damn beach.

1239
01:00:02,720 --> 01:00:04,560
Not those beautiful beach towns.

1240
01:00:04,560 --> 01:00:05,720
Oh, I love it.

1241
01:00:05,720 --> 01:00:08,960
I mean, back to it, back to the beaches of Massachusetts.

1242
01:00:08,960 --> 01:00:10,600
So gorgeous.

1243
01:00:10,600 --> 01:00:12,400
The clouds, the cold.

1244
01:00:12,400 --> 01:00:14,800
You are thinking of the beaches in Boston.

1245
01:00:14,800 --> 01:00:16,000
Yeah, they're all there.

1246
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:17,000
Have you never heard of?

1247
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:18,000
You've never been.

1248
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:19,560
You've never been to like.

1249
01:00:19,560 --> 01:00:20,560
I had a sport.

1250
01:00:20,560 --> 01:00:21,800
It's not right.

1251
01:00:21,800 --> 01:00:23,220
Dennis Cock, dude.

1252
01:00:23,220 --> 01:00:25,420
Have you ever been to Manchester by the sea?

1253
01:00:25,420 --> 01:00:27,020
Yeah, it's bad.

1254
01:00:27,020 --> 01:00:28,160
No, it's a beautiful town.

1255
01:00:28,160 --> 01:00:29,600
Oh, you come to come to.

1256
01:00:29,600 --> 01:00:30,320
How about this?

1257
01:00:30,320 --> 01:00:37,840
Try pleasure island, North Carolina, an island so gorgeous they decided to call it pleasure.

1258
01:00:37,840 --> 01:00:41,680
Okay, do you understand how beautiful something has to be to be like this?

1259
01:00:41,680 --> 01:00:46,400
This is like the pleasure island. I think they would call it beauty island if it was beautiful.

1260
01:00:46,400 --> 01:00:50,960
Well, they wouldn't call it fucking island by the sea. Okay, that means it sucks.

1261
01:00:50,960 --> 01:00:54,480
What about by the sea? It's not Manchester by the sea is really nice and joyous. That's

1262
01:00:54,480 --> 01:00:56,240
That's why they said so many upbeat movies.

1263
01:00:56,240 --> 01:00:58,500
Yeah.

1264
01:00:58,500 --> 01:01:01,520
You ever been to you ever been to Provincetown?

1265
01:01:01,520 --> 01:01:03,080
I have been to Provincetown.

1266
01:01:03,080 --> 01:01:04,760
You talked about Provincetown before.

1267
01:01:04,760 --> 01:01:08,360
Talked about it probably three times in the past couple months.

1268
01:01:08,360 --> 01:01:09,640
I didn't spend much time at the beach when I was at Provincetown.

1269
01:01:09,640 --> 01:01:12,240
You gotta go to the clubs.

1270
01:01:12,240 --> 01:01:12,800
That's right.

1271
01:01:12,800 --> 01:01:15,520
I was eating a fucking $18 hamburger.

1272
01:01:15,520 --> 01:01:17,720
When was the last time any of you were at a nightclub?

1273
01:01:17,720 --> 01:01:19,720
I've never been to a nightclub.

1274
01:01:19,720 --> 01:01:21,720
Actually, I've been to one nightclub.

1275
01:01:21,720 --> 01:01:25,200
Unless you count like a concert, I've never been in a nightclub.

1276
01:01:25,200 --> 01:01:26,720
I've never went clubbing before.

1277
01:01:26,720 --> 01:01:27,720
That's not...

1278
01:01:27,720 --> 01:01:28,720
Wow.

1279
01:01:28,720 --> 01:01:30,720
I think I accidentally went to one last night.

1280
01:01:30,720 --> 01:01:31,720
Accidentally?

1281
01:01:31,720 --> 01:01:32,720
Last night?

1282
01:01:32,720 --> 01:01:38,320
I, um, you know that dude, Rob, CatholicDad420, shout out Rob.

1283
01:01:38,320 --> 01:01:44,120
He was like at this place that's like down the street and I went because it was like

1284
01:01:44,120 --> 01:01:50,040
pretty close to my house and then like I got in there and it was like, like playing like,

1285
01:01:50,040 --> 01:01:53,960
some there's like a DJ there and there's like a bunch of smoke in there and I was just like

1286
01:01:53,960 --> 01:01:59,240
in that scene from triple x like yeah like I was like opening scene from blade I thought it was

1287
01:01:59,240 --> 01:02:03,720
just a bar so I was just like oh like whatever like I'll just go to like this place and then

1288
01:02:03,720 --> 01:02:08,840
like got there and I was immediately like oh this is not the vibe that I thought this was I thought

1289
01:02:08,840 --> 01:02:14,760
this is going to be like a quiet bar whoa yeah you saw fog and you thought it was going to be

1290
01:02:14,760 --> 01:02:19,440
be a quiet bar. I didn't see the fog till I like I turned like this like there's

1291
01:02:19,440 --> 01:02:34,480
like a long hallway. This must be a tranquil, quaint bar with fog and rolling in. It had a long hallway! It had a long hallway and then you take like a right and then it's like the foggiest, darkest room and I was like oh nah I'm gonna

1292
01:02:34,480 --> 01:02:38,240
I'm gonna drink like two beers I'm go home. That was probably pretty smart. Yeah.

1293
01:02:38,240 --> 01:02:41,120
Those two beers probably cost you like $30 right?

1294
01:02:41,120 --> 01:02:41,620
It was...

1295
01:02:41,620 --> 01:02:42,620
Even in nightclub.

1296
01:02:42,620 --> 01:02:43,620
$12.

1297
01:02:43,620 --> 01:02:44,620
Ooh.

1298
01:02:44,620 --> 01:02:45,620
That's not...

1299
01:02:45,620 --> 01:02:46,620
That's still not great.

1300
01:02:46,620 --> 01:02:48,240
I know and they were Modellos too.

1301
01:02:48,240 --> 01:02:49,240
