1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,840
come here come here come here let me see your butt

2
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:16,520
crap monster and we lost our zoom license yeah yeah the last episode I

3
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:20,640
don't know Kayla we didn't tell you about this oh yeah I mean I did literally

4
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:25,680
didn't tell us that we lost the zoom license until the middle of the episode

5
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:29,760
when I just said like five minutes left in your in your meeting yeah and we are

6
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:34,000
to like cut it together. It was maybe the worst episode we've ever done. Well this is good.

7
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,840
At least this is the last time we have to do one on here because I'm getting over my COVID

8
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:45,280
and you guys are probably both completely negative, right? Yeah, I would definitely. Feeling 100%?

9
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:49,680
Yeah, I definitely don't have any COVID at all in my body. Yeah, you guys have been like

10
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:55,760
staying inside, you know? Taking care of yourselves. I've been ordering grocery deliveries so only

11
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:59,840
people that don't matter get exposed. You guys definitely didn't go to one of the biggest

12
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:04,240
COVID hotspots in the fucking world and hang out with a bunch of Uber Eats drivers, right?

13
00:01:04,240 --> 00:01:08,480
No, no, no, I don't even know what you would be talking about. Yeah, that wouldn't make any sense.

14
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:15,360
Yeah, I mean, even if I did, I'm safe for three months, I think. My scientist friend told me that

15
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:20,400
if you get COVID. Patrick was fucking going around, he was saying like, no, I actually can't get COVID

16
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:24,000
for three months. And we were like, oh, really? And he was like, yeah, this guy I know who's a

17
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:29,360
scientist told me. No, it's not a guy. What do you mean you don't have a scientist? I have a scientist friend. Who?

18
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:35,360
Dr. Lisa Bobby. No. You don't know a Lisa Bobby?

19
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:42,400
Yes, I do. No, you don't. You don't know Lisa Bobby. I know Lisa Bobby. No, you don't. Uh-huh. No.

20
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:48,000
What is she assigned? What's her field of study? COVID-19, actually. Where'd you go to school?

21
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:51,120
Uh, Traeger University.

22
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:54,000
Traeger University, okay. Like the smoker?

23
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,440
Yes.

24
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:57,120
Okay, gotcha.

25
00:01:57,120 --> 00:02:00,400
They specialize.

26
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:01,440
What do they specialize in?

27
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:08,720
In, um, you know, the thermometers that can detect whether or not you have a fever for COVID.

28
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:11,600
Meat thermometers for people?

29
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:15,520
Yes. You put it right in your butt and it uh...

30
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:16,560
Come on, man.

31
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:18,640
What? Where else is it gonna go?

32
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:20,320
Your mouth. Your mouth.

33
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:21,200
Your mouth or ear.

34
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:24,720
Have you guys ever had to take a thermometer in your butt?

35
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:27,440
Well, I didn't have to, but I did.

36
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:28,480
Not have to, I guess.

37
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:31,200
I didn't have to, I did it by choice.

38
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:32,800
Why?

39
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:36,080
Accuracy.

40
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:36,640
He's lying.

41
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:38,160
It is more accurate, supposedly.

42
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:39,040
He's lying.

43
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:41,920
Yeah, but the problem is it's like one of those like forehead read ones.

44
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:45,360
You shot a laser into your asshole.

45
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:45,520
Yeah.

46
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:48,400
It's like, it's one of those ones that's like a...

47
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:50,400
It's like on an iPad.

48
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:51,400
There you go.

49
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:52,400
There's the camera on it.

50
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:54,840
You're supposed to line up your face with it.

51
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:58,040
Yeah, no way those work.

52
00:02:58,040 --> 00:02:59,040
How was Florida?

53
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:00,040
Oh, dude, it was amazing.

54
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:01,040
It was swagged out.

55
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:04,040
It was a YouTube Red original?

56
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:05,040
Uh-huh, dude.

57
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:06,040
That's fucking sick, man.

58
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:09,440
Dude, it was a 2B original that we did.

59
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:10,440
Damn.

60
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:13,080
Yeah, we stayed in an econo-lodge.

61
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:14,520
You stayed in one?

62
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:16,960
And the door never opened, dude.

63
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:18,680
You stayed in an econo lodge with no door?

64
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:22,600
We stayed in an econo lodge and the door never opened.

65
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:23,600
Did I say stayed in?

66
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:24,600
Yeah, you did.

67
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:29,040
I like that you said "and the door never opened" like that would make any sense to anyone besides

68
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:30,040
me.

69
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:34,120
Dude, the door to the hotel room was fucked up and you had to like try and open it like

70
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:35,120
a hundred times.

71
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:37,360
Yeah, it's an econo lodge, man.

72
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:39,600
Yeah, but you know the door never opened.

73
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:41,840
I slept in my clothes both nights.

74
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:45,880
We stayed in there and the door never opened.

75
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:47,880
I just love my little kid friend.

76
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:52,800
He literally is fucking the second day.

77
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:56,560
He woke me up at like 7 a.m. because he just woke up and he's like, well, it's time to be

78
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:57,560
awake now.

79
00:03:57,560 --> 00:03:59,440
Oh, there's fucking six years old.

80
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:00,480
Such a nightmare.

81
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:04,000
That's like I feel so bad for fucking Neil having to live next to him.

82
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,080
Just hit your just knock on his door.

83
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:09,160
If he wakes up too early, just sitting in the doorway.

84
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:10,360
I open my eyes now.

85
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:12,560
Hey, Neil, I threw up.

86
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:13,560
What am I supposed to do?

87
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:14,560
I have done that before.

88
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:18,800
I know you have I knocked on this door to ask him if a sweater looked weird on me

89
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:22,960
Just interrupting all his meetings at his fucking work shit

90
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:28,000
To be like should I should I checkerboard my shoelaces? Is that still cool?

91
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:40,020
I'm actually gonna do that now. We need to bring that back. Yeah, it was so cool. Oh, man

92
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:45,600
I'm just people did cool shit with their with their shoelaces man doing straight laces

93
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:49,880
Yeah, straight laces were straight laces on the etnies dude. Yeah

94
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:57,840
She was she knew I got a cartoon character. Uh-huh unbelievably cool dude. I have a next I have the next big thing, huh?

95
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:00,320
barbed wire shoelace

96
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:04,540
That's cool. That's pretty cool. I am you have to tie them with gloves

97
00:05:04,540 --> 00:05:10,600
I've just tied my shoelaces together and I hop around that's it's a good. Yeah, what up?

98
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:14,600
It's pretty much the new, it's Matt Brick outside and this is the new vibe.

99
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:19,920
When I tied my shoes earlier that shit was a Shutter Original.

100
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:22,040
Check out my shoes, they're tied together bro.

101
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:24,040
I tied both my shoes together.

102
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:26,040
What are those shoes that don't have laces?

103
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:27,040
Slip-ons.

104
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:28,040
The slip-ons.

105
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:31,120
You know those slip-ons that people always wear?

106
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:32,120
Vans slip-ons.

107
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:33,480
Yeah, those ones.

108
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:35,880
I'm drilling lace holes in those.

109
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:36,960
That's smart.

110
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:39,400
That's gonna be my big fashion thing.

111
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:40,400
There used to be a...

112
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:42,320
Also, I'm cutting a tongue into them, too.

113
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:44,320
I'm making them look exactly like a normal shoe.

114
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:46,040
Well, the whole shoe is a tongue.

115
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:48,440
No, I'm making them into a normal shoe.

116
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:49,680
Think about that in my laboratory.

117
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:52,920
I'm covering my body in laces like I'm going to be a mummy.

118
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:53,920
Yeah.

119
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:59,920
I'm waiting for lunch and I was laughing so hard.

120
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:04,880
Imagining going into a restaurant and being like, "Yeah, I'm actually a food scientist,

121
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:08,640
so I'm going to study this food to make sure that it's good."

122
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:10,640
it's way too hot first of all.

123
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:12,640
And second of all, the whole vibe is off in here,

124
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:16,640
so I'm gonna need to teleport your restaurant back into my food laboratory

125
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:18,640
and do a few updates.

126
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:20,640
We were at some, we were at some like

127
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:23,640
fucking, what was that place called?

128
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:26,640
Dude, Pat literally saw a restaurant across the street called Love Child

129
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:28,640
and was like, "Let's go there."

130
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:29,640
Love Child.

131
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:31,640
It said it had Cubanos.

132
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:34,640
I wanted a Cubano in Tampa. I heard that that's where you go.

133
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:35,640
For Cubanos.

134
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:42,420
But it was not an authentic Cuban place. It was not owned by like a five foot tall. You mean I Tico

135
00:06:42,420 --> 00:06:47,900
Authentico it was not authentic. Oh, it was very trendy. It was a good cue. It was a good it was good lunch

136
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:49,960
But it was good food. Yeah

137
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:52,680
But it was

138
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:58,040
We got dude they had a vending machine that had a tamagotchi in there. Why yeah

139

But yeah, they we got what was it like yucca fries or something and it came out. I was like sauce

yeah I don't make you shit yeah no I forgot about it I almost got it I said I

168
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:13,320
said uh let me get like double hash browns everything on it and then the I

169
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:18,920
thought she said do you want to leave everything on it yeah I said well almost

170
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:25,920
Almost, almost. I got sausage gravy. I almost got sausage gravy and chewy.

171
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:29,920
Can I get a hamburger with mostly everything on it?

172
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:36,920
Most of the stuff on it. I didn't want to sit there and go chopped, fucking smothered, covered, and peppered.

173
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:40,920
That's like the whole reason why they named it Fun Shit, so that it doesn't feel like a chore.

174
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:48,520
Sure, you can say smothered, covered, chopped, peppered, and uh, staked?

175
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:49,520
What's the other one?

176
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:50,520
I don't know.

177
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:51,520
Ah, fuck.

178
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:52,520
Fuck.

179
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:58,280
But I almost got sausage gravy and chili on it until the other waitress came over and

180
00:09:58,280 --> 00:10:00,840
was like, "Are you sure you want chili on it?"

181
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:03,360
And I was like, "No, absolutely not.

182
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:05,920
I could not handle that."

183
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:10,680
I thought she said chili and I thought that she meant like, I thought she meant chili peppers.

184
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:13,080
I thought you meant like chilies.

185
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:15,600
She thought they had chili peppers at Waffle House?

186
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:19,000
Yes, I thought they had like poblanos.

187
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,840
Poblano chili at Waffle House?

188
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:21,840
No.

189
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:22,840
Well, they have jalapenos.

190
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:23,840
Yeah.

191
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:30,760
Last time I was at Waffle House was around Christmas and I went with Noah and Noah started

192
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:36,160
um, Noah like went to the bathroom and then all these people there, it was like just two

193
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:39,680
groups of people there and all these people just started yelling, it was like three in

194
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:42,400
the morning. We started yelling through the bathroom door that they could hear him

195
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:46,640
shitting. It was like, "Oh I hear you shitting in there! That's nasty as hell!

196
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:53,040
Oooo-wee! Oooo-wee!" And we just sat there, we just did nothing. We just didn't even talk to them.

197
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:58,040
We were just letting Noah get destroyed through a bathroom door while he dropped a

198
00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:03,800
nasty waffle. That was shit. He didn't even eat anything. He just went into shit.

199
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:09,280
He brought that from home. Yeah, no it was pretty fucked up. Yeah. Dude, our Uber driver made fun of

200
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:15,720
us for going to Waffle House. What the fuck? Yeah. I knew if you were there. Yeah, if you're

201
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:19,240
from out of town, you probably, you didn't even, you didn't know better than to go to

202
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:22,640
Waffle House. You told them we liked Waffle House and you didn't talk to us. I like Waffle

203
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:27,240
House. I'd try to go here and there. He's a fucking idiot, man. And then he just like

204
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:31,800
didn't talk for the rest of the drive. Because I fucking showed him up with my intellectuality.

205
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:37,280
What was it like to destroy him in his own car? We rated it one star and didn't tip. That's

206
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:42,560
right I don't tip these people anyway I'm I'm trying I mean it's European hey

207
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:48,360
here's a crazy job crazy shit was down there every fucking uber driver asked us

208
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:52,280
to give them five stars yeah every time we would get out of a ride that I when

209
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:55,840
that's saying this but it's because everyone owns their owns a car and drunk

210
00:11:55,840 --> 00:12:01,960
drives yeah oh like there's no reason to call it that was the strangest I that

211
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:05,840
was so strange to me but I guess it's normal I don't know what part of Florida

212
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:11,600
you guys in? Here in Tampa. Oh, Tampa sucks. Yeah. It's horrible. Tampa's the worst. It's

213
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:16,640
the worst place ever. Yeah, it's pretty bad. Oh, shout out to uh, shout out to Shooter.

214
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:22,960
Shout out to our boy. No. Yeah. This podcast isn't for shout outs, Pat.

215
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:27,120
Yeah. I just wanted to. You can start your own fucking podcast or you can say your friend's name.

216
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:32,720
If Pat did a spin-off podcast, it would be an hour of him shouting people out and saying thank you to

00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:38,720
people I'm thanking him for showing us a lot of thank you saying hello yeah he's

222
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:04,160
to ring your neck. When I see you, I'm going to ring your fucking neck.

223
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:08,640
Oh, I did. Speaking of Lyft drivers, we did see a really good Lyft driver fun fact.

224
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:10,080
Oh, yeah.

225
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:15,640
Our Lyft driver, Hoy, his fun fact was, "I can and will dance in public."

226
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:17,680
Whoa, that is good.

227
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:18,680
It's a good one.

228
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:23,200
Remember that guy that we asked him if he liked chocolate? His fun fact said he loved

229
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:24,200
--

230
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:27,800
His fun fact was, yeah, he liked savory snacks instead of sweet snacks or something like

231
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:28,800
that.

232
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:31,200
and we were like, "Ah man."

233
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:32,900
You know, "Hey, settle a debate for us.

234
00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:33,740
We're having this debate.

235
00:13:33,740 --> 00:13:34,680
Which one's better?

236
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:36,480
Savor snacks or sweet snacks?"

237
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:37,680
(laughing)

238
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:40,560
It's like 3.30 in the morning.

239
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:42,400
Getting into a Lyft and he's like, "Uh."

240
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:43,860
- Yeah, and I'm just being like, "Yeah,

241
00:13:43,860 --> 00:13:45,720
well I like pretzels, but like,

242
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:47,880
I don't like Hershey's chocolate bars."

243
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:49,560
- I just don't get it.

244
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:51,200
How do people like sweet snacks?

245
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:53,480
Savor snacks are definitely better.

246
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:55,360
- It's the worst getting into like Ubers

247
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:56,200
with you guys sometimes.

248
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:57,040
- Why?

249
00:13:57,040 --> 00:14:04,320
so like you just you want you'd rather just look at the ground yes no dude i'm the i'd rather look

250
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:09,440
at the ground give them a nice tip and say thank you if i was literally there to be the ant under

251
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:15,600
your magnifying glass dude you should be eliminating him from existence they have to listen to whatever

252
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:21,440
you say you remember that dude there was one time we were i was just me and caleb in a car

253
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:28,000
And the Lyft driver honked at the guy in front of him, and Caleb was just like, "Is that your enemy?"

254
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:33,280
And then for the rest of the ride, you kept saying like, "Yeah, I'm thinking about getting a nemesis

255
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:41,040
and an enemy. I'm thinking about, I'm finally gonna get a nemesis." And then you kept asking me,

256
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:47,600
you kept asking me who my nemesis was, and I didn't want to answer you, and I felt so uncomfortable in

257
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:52,640
in the car. You're shy. I am. That's what's great about riding. In the car I'm shy. Dude,

258
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:56,640
I'm shy as fuck but not in lifts baby. The great thing about a lift driver is it's like

259
00:14:56,640 --> 00:15:02,920
having, like riding in a lift with Patrick is like having two lift drivers. It's like

260
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:07,880
two people who just anything that you say to them they're just gonna be like, "Mm-hmm.

261
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:14,400
Oh yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah." They just won't talk to you at all. Except yeah, except every once

262
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:18,200
in a while they'll say something like, "Oh, you know there were like a hundred murders

263
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:19,200
here?"

264
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:20,200
Yeah.

265
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:21,200
It's like, "Yeah, out of nowhere."

266
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:22,200
I like to bring that up.

267
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:23,520
It's gotta be a hundred and one.

268
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:26,820
How would you fucking pedal to the metal, you slow motherfucker?

269
00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:27,820
That's right.

270
00:15:27,820 --> 00:15:28,820
That's right.

271
00:15:28,820 --> 00:15:29,820
That's right.

272
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:30,820
Yeah.

273
00:15:30,820 --> 00:15:33,540
If I wanted to go this slow, I would have got a city bike, pal.

274
00:15:33,540 --> 00:15:38,260
When I was a kid, whenever we'd go to the airport, my dad knew this taxi driver that

275
00:15:38,260 --> 00:15:39,260
he would call.

276
00:15:39,260 --> 00:15:41,460
you'd always call the same guy

277
00:15:41,460 --> 00:15:43,340
and he drove a minivan

278
00:15:43,340 --> 00:15:48,080
and uh... he had a little members little screens that uh... was like like

279
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:51,460
portable dvd players if you would have their cars on the back of the year

280
00:15:51,460 --> 00:15:53,940
as they had a little wheel that you could you played with

281
00:15:53,940 --> 00:15:55,540
no i wish

282
00:15:55,540 --> 00:15:58,060
he had a lot of what i have those in this

283
00:15:58,060 --> 00:16:00,420
he had was portable dvd players

284
00:16:00,420 --> 00:16:03,140
that he would set on the console

285
00:16:03,140 --> 00:16:06,720
and he would watch the final fantasy movies while he was driving

286
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:11,120
that's the sickest shit ever that's there's only two there's only two final

287
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:15,000
fantasy movies he would rotate between the two and literally every time we took

288
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:19,160
this car he's watching one of the final fantasy movies the they should put in

289
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:23,440
lifts like in a like in a student driver car how you have a second steering wheel

290
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:28,760
and a second brake yeah so you can you can just do no they should they should

291
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:31,400
put a little steering wheel in the back so you can pretend like you're driving

292
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:36,920
driving too. That's for you. Yeah. I'm actually driving a little, a little horn that I can

293
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:41,560
press. You should be able to hawk the horn whenever you want. Oh, there should be, there

294
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:46,000
should be a button in the back of the lift. You pay, you pay a little bit extra. There's

295
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:49,400
a button in the back and you can just hold down the horn. That's what the, that, yeah,

296
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:53,160
that's what the fucking, the like lift or like Uber subscription or whatever is where

297
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:55,760
you can, you know, you can like get like a premium version of it. They should add so many

298
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:59,760
more options. You should be able to call a cash cab also for an airfee. You should be

299
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:03,840
able to drop you should be able to drop like spike strips on the ground behind it too.

300
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:04,840
Yes.

301
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:05,840
Oh dude.

302
00:17:05,840 --> 00:17:06,840
You know what sucks is when you-

303
00:17:06,840 --> 00:17:07,840
Batmobile Nitro also?

304
00:17:07,840 --> 00:17:11,440
You know what sucks is when you get, you're in like a, you have the subscription, you

305
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:18,920
get in an Uber XL and then the person behind you is in an Uber Black and he throws a blue

306
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:20,240
shell at you.

307
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:21,240
That shit sucks.

308
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:22,760
Is it Uber Black?

309
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:25,680
Is that the, like the Bentleys and stuff?

310
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:27,380
I don't think they have Bentleys.

311
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:34,380
I think it's like they get like a black Escalade. I don't think they have like Rolls Royces.

312
00:17:34,380 --> 00:17:40,360
I think it's like I think they get like a like an Audi sometimes. I think you're wrong. There

313
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:44,580
should also be Uber hang gliders and you can like get if you're in a building you want

314
00:17:44,580 --> 00:17:51,180
to get to the next building. You should be able to Uber shoes that you can walk in and

315
00:17:51,180 --> 00:17:54,940
then drop off. Yeah. When you don't need them anymore. Oh dude like the inspector gadget

316
00:17:54,940 --> 00:18:00,140
shoes yeah like the big ones no actually no big normal stilts that you can just

317
00:18:00,140 --> 00:18:04,140
throw out the city i don't think those are street legal

318
00:18:04,140 --> 00:18:07,660
hmm i don't think you can have giant stilts on the street i think you need to

319
00:18:07,660 --> 00:18:11,340
be you need to have a license or a permit

320
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:15,340
to be on stilts that's not true yeah that's not true at

321
00:18:15,340 --> 00:18:18,140
all that no there's no way that if you walk down

322
00:18:18,140 --> 00:18:22,380
if you like walked around brooklyn with stilts on

323
00:18:22,380 --> 00:18:25,900
the police are gonna stop i mean they tell you to stop but i don't think that

324
00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:28,700
they're going to stop you because you don't have a license i think they're

325
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:30,780
going to stop you because you're walking around still

326
00:18:30,780 --> 00:18:33,500
are you talking like walking in the bike lane on stilts or walking on the

327
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:37,340
sidewalk walking anywhere on stilts you're not they're not they're gonna i

328
00:18:37,340 --> 00:18:40,140
agree that they're gonna stop you but i don't think that there's i don't think

329
00:18:40,140 --> 00:18:43,340
that there's a something you can show them that would get them to not stop you

330
00:18:43,340 --> 00:18:48,780
the only thing that's gonna stop you is a guy with an android phone going

331
00:18:48,780 --> 00:18:50,780
Oh, only in New York!

332
00:18:50,780 --> 00:18:52,780
What the fuck?

333
00:18:52,780 --> 00:18:55,780
That would be good to be con- I mean, I feel like there is a whole-

334
00:18:55,780 --> 00:18:59,780
'Cause there- okay, so there's the guy who rides around Manhattan with the basketball on his head.

335
00:18:59,780 --> 00:19:00,780
Oh, I love him.

336
00:19:00,780 --> 00:19:01,780
Oh, he's the best.

337
00:19:01,780 --> 00:19:03,780
Multiple times, he goes "Baaaaah!"

338
00:19:03,780 --> 00:19:04,780
Yeah, he has-

339
00:19:04,780 --> 00:19:05,780
I got it!

340
00:19:05,780 --> 00:19:06,780
He's got a horn, I love him dude.

341
00:19:06,780 --> 00:19:07,780
He says "I got it."

342
00:19:07,780 --> 00:19:08,780
Uh-huh.

343
00:19:08,780 --> 00:19:10,780
And there's- who else is there?

344
00:19:10,780 --> 00:19:11,780
It might just be that guy.

345
00:19:11,780 --> 00:19:12,780
Oh, Tweek Season.

346
00:19:12,780 --> 00:19:13,780
Who's Tweek Season?

347
00:19:13,780 --> 00:19:14,780
Donald Trump.

348
00:19:14,780 --> 00:19:15,780
There's Donald Trump.

349
00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:16,780
Who's Tweek Season?

350
00:19:16,780 --> 00:19:18,500
- Is SpeakSeason's the guy on TikTok

351
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:22,180
who walks around and finds weird shit and makes fun of it?

352
00:19:22,180 --> 00:19:23,100
- I don't know that dude.

353
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:25,740
- Oh dude, if I ever ended up in one of those,

354
00:19:25,740 --> 00:19:26,620
I'd kill myself.

355
00:19:26,620 --> 00:19:30,300
- But there's a good, there's definitely a hole to be filled

356
00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:34,100
for maybe like a bald white guy on 10 foot stilts.

357
00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:34,940
- Yeah. - Yeah.

358
00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:35,900
- Or a unicycle.

359
00:19:35,900 --> 00:19:37,420
- Oh, oh, here's what you can do.

360
00:19:37,420 --> 00:19:39,900
Okay, so you get like 10 foot stilts

361
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:41,940
and like an Uncle Sam costume.

362
00:19:41,940 --> 00:19:43,300
- Yeah, that'd be huge.

363
00:19:43,300 --> 00:19:44,740
- Yeah. - Yeah.

364
00:19:44,740 --> 00:19:49,820
and you know i a big and big hands to like big uh... like foam fingers

365
00:19:49,820 --> 00:19:52,420
but they have a lot of start a parade

366
00:19:52,420 --> 00:19:57,220
yes you'd all my god i'm so fucking glad u_s_ i was trying to sneak it into this

367
00:19:57,220 --> 00:19:58,900
conversation

368
00:19:58,900 --> 00:20:02,180
you know we can walk around and i think that you know two-person llama costume

369
00:20:02,180 --> 00:20:05,060
because of a sort of weekly marching band for a hit

370
00:20:05,060 --> 00:20:06,260
yeah i'm not

371
00:20:06,260 --> 00:20:10,860
that the route is is every single street we go like we snaked out we just

372
00:20:10,860 --> 00:20:16,260
surround every block in brooklyn so we know everybody just really more out there

373
00:20:16,260 --> 00:20:18,540
twenty four-hour parade

374
00:20:18,540 --> 00:20:21,340
and we get these people are used to like

375
00:20:21,340 --> 00:20:23,400
despacito blasting out of a car

376
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:25,680
when speeds by they're not used to it

377
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:26,440
yeah you know

378
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:29,800
the song is a very by the way very slow parade

379
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:34,300
yes it was like a very old to bus and all to the wheelchair parade

380
00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:36,180
all to you

381
00:20:36,180 --> 00:20:40,700
people in your chairs playing to boost down a fucking myrtle broadway

382
00:20:40,700 --> 00:20:45,020
and just see what happens.

383
00:20:45,020 --> 00:20:47,420
The worst cyclists in the world too.

384
00:20:47,420 --> 00:20:48,920
Because what are these cops going to do?

385
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:52,820
Stop a bunch of young people in wheelchairs trying to express themselves?

386
00:20:52,820 --> 00:20:55,020
That's a bad look for the NYPD.

387
00:20:55,020 --> 00:21:01,240
I think more likely they just keep, that wheelchair parade just keeps going until they get fucking

388
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:03,380
blasted by an escalade one day.

389
00:21:03,380 --> 00:21:10,220
They get all the way to the Brooklyn Bridge one day and out of nowhere, big ol' caddy.

390
00:21:10,220 --> 00:21:15,660
honk and escalate just destroys them. An escalate with 50 more tuba players hanging off the side.

391
00:21:15,660 --> 00:21:22,740
We can do a faster parade than you! We can get a way faster parade down this street!

392
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:26,340
After a while of the parade, the cops are going to be like, "Okay, you guys are going to have

393
00:21:26,340 --> 00:21:32,380
to have a parade license to do this." And then, one tuba player on every train car on

394
00:21:32,380 --> 00:21:39,900
every train. Oh my god. 24/7 until they let us do the parade again. Do you guys want to

395
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:44,260
maybe a flash mob kind of improv everywhere type thing I yes I was

396
00:21:44,260 --> 00:21:47,700
thinking about that I've been doing them I've been doing them by myself we can do

397
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:52,980
like a three person flash the first guy to ever see a flash mob like I literally

398
00:21:52,980 --> 00:21:55,540
probably would have killed myself just I would have thought it was I would have

399
00:21:55,540 --> 00:21:59,860
been so scared yeah I would have been like I would be like these people

400
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:04,020
there's some kind of infection yeah these people have been are being

401
00:22:04,020 --> 00:22:09,140
controlled I literally never trust reality again yeah if I saw a flash mob

402
00:22:09,140 --> 00:22:15,860
I'd feel I'd feel so left out. Yeah. I oh my god are you kidding me?

403
00:22:15,860 --> 00:22:18,820
A flash mob should I just based on the name of flash home should be like a

404
00:22:18,820 --> 00:22:22,340
million women just showing their boobs to I think that's what it used to be.

405
00:22:22,340 --> 00:22:28,060
That can't be true. And then PC culture ruined it. Really? Mm-hmm.

406
00:22:28,060 --> 00:22:33,940
There's another L for PC culture man. Yeah. Yeah. Well cuz it was I think it

407
00:22:33,940 --> 00:22:38,740
wasn't it a flash mob because it was the no pants subway ride

408
00:22:38,740 --> 00:22:41,800
you know i'm gonna be real with you i haven't done

409
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:45,820

410
00:22:45,820 --> 00:22:48,820

411
00:22:48,820 --> 00:22:49,980
what the fuck

412
00:22:49,980 --> 00:22:53,340

413
00:22:53,340 --> 00:22:55,980

414
00:22:55,980 --> 00:22:58,320

416
00:23:01,260 --> 00:23:03,260
I'm now the extra work

417
00:23:03,260 --> 00:23:04,760
I'm a normal now

418
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:06,060
He's sitting there going

419
00:23:06,060 --> 00:23:07,060
Shit, my...

420
00:23:07,060 --> 00:23:09,060
*laughter*

421
00:23:09,060 --> 00:23:10,460
*imitates sound*

422
00:23:10,460 --> 00:23:12,160
I sounded normal over here

423
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:12,860
Oh man

424
00:23:12,860 --> 00:23:15,260
Of course you did, you're talking out loud

425
00:23:15,260 --> 00:23:19,760
My ears sound fine, I mean I'm just, I'm not talking any differently over here

426
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:20,260
Yeah

427
00:23:20,260 --> 00:23:23,260
But yeah, I don't know all that much about flash mobs, Pat

428
00:23:23,260 --> 00:23:26,160
I haven't done, I guess, as much research as you have

429
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:27,860
Into the art

430
00:23:27,860 --> 00:23:28,560
I know

431
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:29,860
Well you seem to know the origin

432
00:23:29,860 --> 00:23:31,860
I know the no pants subway ride.

433
00:23:31,860 --> 00:23:33,860
You scrolled down to the early.

434
00:23:33,860 --> 00:23:35,860
Everyone knows the no pants subway ride.

435
00:23:35,860 --> 00:23:37,860
That's because you googled no pants subway ride

436
00:23:37,860 --> 00:23:39,860
will I get arrested.

437
00:23:39,860 --> 00:23:41,860
Well one day I've lost my pants.

438
00:23:41,860 --> 00:23:43,860
It's not hard to fucking you know.

439
00:23:43,860 --> 00:23:45,860
It's not hard to what?

440
00:23:45,860 --> 00:23:47,860
It's not hard to lose your pants sometimes.

441
00:23:47,860 --> 00:23:49,860
It's not hard to expose yourself.

442
00:23:49,860 --> 00:23:51,860
It's not hard to go swimming.

443
00:23:51,860 --> 00:23:53,860
Go swimming in the east river.

444
00:23:53,860 --> 00:23:55,860
Oh what's this?

445
00:23:55,860 --> 00:23:57,860
It's 3.15pm on a weekday.

446
00:23:57,860 --> 00:24:03,460
I'm gonna lose my pants. Oh, there they go. Oh, there they go. And I'm on the subway. Oh,

447
00:24:03,460 --> 00:24:09,460
SMH. Oh, I'm off the subway. I hope I don't take an especially winding route home today

448
00:24:09,460 --> 00:24:17,500
that surrounds several very crowded restaurants and dare I say playgrounds? No. I couldn't.

449
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:36,800
day I get shit for being myself like like you know like an exhibitionist and

450
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:40,720
pretend that you lost your pants and our traders tried to get home like in a

451
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:43,240
giant spiral like around your house

452
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:50,440
yeah oh dear, oh dear, I had my GPS in my pants and I'm completely lost

453
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:54,680
I had a piece of paper with my address on them in my pants and now I can't find

454
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:55,200
them

455
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:58,840
I forget my home oh dear, they're in your hand

456
00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:02,280
oh they're in my hand the whole time like a remote

457
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:06,560
oh god this is embarrassing oh there he goes again

458
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:10,240
what the fuck's wrong with your shit dude, god damn it dude

459
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:14,640
I can hear myself. I'm gonna ruin the episode regardless.

460
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:17,640
Don't test me.

461
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:23,040
You're not gonna do shit. I will. You won't do shit. You're a coward.

462
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:27,240
I'm not a coward. You're the cowardly lion.

463
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:30,640
What was that?

464
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:33,000
Would a coward make that noise?

465
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,000
What was that, a whisper?

466
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,000
Did that scare you?

467
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,000
No, that only works in person.

468
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,000
Fuck, I miss you guys.

469
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,000
Damn it, I hate this.

470
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,000
It does suck.

471
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:45,280
All right, so today we got a...

472
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:46,280
We have, I mean, as...

473
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:47,720
Which one should we do first?

474
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:49,800
I think the odd one.

475
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:50,800
All right.

476
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:52,760
Wait, which one's that?

477
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:53,760
They're both sent in the chat.

478
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:54,760
I'll send it to you.

479
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:55,760
Wait, are these made by...

480
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:56,760
Yeah, they're made by the same guy.

481
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:57,760
Perfect.

482
00:25:57,760 --> 00:26:15,760
do

483
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:19,120
I was naive and kind of lame when I first joined this site.

484
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:20,120
I've changed.

485
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:21,120
Facts.

486
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:22,120
I can relate to that 100%.

487
00:26:22,120 --> 00:26:26,560
I joined summer 2018, early gen 19 if we still use that terminology.

488
00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:27,560
I like to write.

489
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:28,560
Check out my stuff here.

490
00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:31,960
I'm mostly inactive, only occasionally logging in to comment and check out my stuff.

491
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:35,920
I'm one of many who left a sinking ship that is this site due to admin's pointless changes

492
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:39,040
and needlessly strict personality.

493
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:42,680
And can I please change my name to Second World or A'Shy?

494
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:45,120
It's probably not that hard to add that feature.

495
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:51,320
facts. So the description to top 10 things that writers do that are seen as odd. Sometimes

496
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:56,100
when writing a story things go well, other times things go wrong. What you can always

497
00:26:56,100 --> 00:27:01,040
count on though are things that some might think are strange. Yeah. Wow. That is so nice

498
00:27:01,040 --> 00:27:03,960
to get. I've definitely had that experience. I mean like I would say that all three of us

499
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:07,900
are writers right? We're working on different. Definitely. I mean I have a novella in the

500
00:27:07,900 --> 00:27:13,000
works that I've been kind of talking to people about, shopping around. I'm working on, I'm

501
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:17,320
working yeah well you set yours yeah go ahead well it's seven pages long mm-hmm

502
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:21,680
because it's a novella you know it's not like technically that as long as like a

503
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:28,240
normal novel and it's actually about a giant a great white whale but I've been

504
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:33,320
working seven pages well yeah I feel like I mean that honestly sounds I can

505
00:27:33,320 --> 00:27:37,280
imagine some of the scenes in that being painterly I mean like I guess for me the

506
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:42,840
most important thing is like concisicity and in my writing and like it being

507
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:47,080
like easy to understand for like a more broader like general audience.

508
00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:51,400
Yeah, I'm actually kind of on the other end of the spectrum because I've been working on

509
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:57,240
this like it's kind of like a multi-format piece like I would say it bridges the gap between

510
00:27:57,240 --> 00:28:04,480
a screenplay and a poem and it's about 792 pages at the moment but I'm trying to kind

511
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:10,320
of you know thread in different influences like you know plays definitely novellas like

512
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:17,040
yours, like spreadsheets, pencil drawing, and just kind of as many different mixed media as I can add.

513
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:21,120
And I think that it will kind of like bridge, you know, a lot of experiences throughout the

514
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:23,440
universe and help people understand what it's like to read a 800-page piece of paper.

515
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:29,200
That's cool. I love that kind of multimedia, like David Foster W. style thing. You know what I mean?

516
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:34,000
Definitely. Yeah. It's also very like House of My Leaves, you know?

517
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:38,000
Yeah. One thing that I've been looking into recently is like edible pages. Like once you

518
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,340
you read the page you can actually eat it with your mouth.

519
00:28:40,340 --> 00:28:43,040
Oh yeah, destructibility. That's actually big in my work.

520
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:47,200
Yeah, like because I feel like everything is just, everything is so like, like

521
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:52,480
ephemerality it has. Ephemerality, you know what I mean? So like I need to, I'm

522
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:54,920
getting super into like things that are ephemeral.

523
00:28:54,920 --> 00:28:59,440
Yeah, and I feel like... Have you read, have you, have you read any No David?

524
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:04,400
No, have you read... No David's huge in the destructibility scene. I would

525
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:08,400
Did he write Gaunche's Bluff?

526
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:09,400
No.

527
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:10,400
No.

528
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:11,400
Who?

529
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:12,400
That was me.

530
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:13,400
That was, uh, nuh uh.

531
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:14,400
That wasn't you, that was Slic3r.

532
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:16,160
I wrote the sequel.

533
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:17,720
I just write to my pen pal.

534
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:18,720
Really?

535
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:21,400
Well, I'm not anymore, he was in prison.

536
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:22,800
Pistolaries.

537
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:26,120
He passed away a couple days ago.

538
00:29:26,120 --> 00:29:28,520
Love Pistolaries.

539
00:29:28,520 --> 00:29:34,760
So, as writers, like, I think we can all probably relate to this, like, we might not be the same

540
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:36,880
as other people in a kind of way.

541
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:40,960
Definitely odd and strange in the perception of, like, society at large.

542
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:44,600
Like, to a normal person, like, have you ever thought of the fact that maybe, like, the

543
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:48,760
blue that you see is different from the blue that I see as, like, a writer?

544
00:29:48,760 --> 00:29:49,760
Yes!

545
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:51,800
Yeah, so that's most, that's a huge part of what my book is about.

546
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:52,800
It could be B-L-O-O.

547
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:53,800
Exactly.

548
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:59,480
So, number one, they see their characters as real people but confined within the walls of the mind

549
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:06,280
and page. So, I mean, I think every writer in the whole, in the damn world could probably relate to

550
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:12,760
this one. I relate to this comment right here. It says, "Because I am a man who makes tainted

551
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:17,320
mistakes that I highly regret so much that I want to forget my illusion mindset, which I'm not

552
00:30:17,320 --> 00:30:22,040
delusional anymore, but a man who hates Jeffrey, a teen who is struggling, his anger issues, and

553
00:30:22,040 --> 00:30:25,640
mostly of all I believe that I don't like hate that I like all of the people

554
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:29,080
around me but my anger encrypted of who I am and it's not my fault I have anger

555
00:30:29,080 --> 00:30:32,720
issues I don't know if I've been abused or not I didn't respond because I was

556
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:39,360
busy what well sorry actually he or Siri actually responds here he says all right

557
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:42,840
we get it now can we end this petty conflict while you let it reach a

558
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:49,600
conclusion like again kind of writerly you know no conflict yeah exactly one of

559
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:52,180
the biggest hammers in a writer's toolbox.

560
00:30:52,180 --> 00:30:55,200
Exactly. It's all hammers, they're just different sizes.

561
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:58,000
It's 100% hammers, because we're nailing the words onto the page.

562
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:03,200
Much like the nails were thrusted through the hands of Christ.

563
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:04,200
Who?

564
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:05,200
Christ.

565
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:06,200
Who?

566
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:10,700
Okay, well I got a book recommendation for you, my good friend.

567
00:31:10,700 --> 00:31:12,200
And it's actually the Holy Bible.

568
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:14,700
The New Testament, specifically. You can ignore the Old Testament.

569
00:31:14,700 --> 00:31:16,200
Oh, I only read the Old One.

570
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:17,200
What?

571
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:18,200
Yeah.

572
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:19,200
Yeah.

573
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:24,160
Uh, number two, they find that their world and characters are quite prominent in their

574
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:25,160
dreams.

575
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:26,160
You sound...

576
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:27,160
Your audio's going, uh...

577
00:31:27,160 --> 00:31:29,080
Dude, what's going on with your Wi-Fi?

578
00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:30,960
My Wi-Fi is normal.

579
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:34,600
No, it's not.

580
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:35,600
What?

581
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:36,600
It's normal now.

582
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:37,600
You sound like a robot.

583
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:42,040
I just re- I've just recently made the switch to AOL and, uh...

584
00:31:42,040 --> 00:31:43,040
Really?

585
00:31:43,040 --> 00:31:44,760
Yeah, I might be running out of the disk space, actually.

586
00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:46,480
That's probably... it could be your typewriter.

587
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:47,480
Well...

588
00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:52,320
Oh yeah, you have one of those fucking typewriters that connects to the internet.

589
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:53,320
Yeah.

590
00:31:53,320 --> 00:31:54,320
Okay, well somebody else can use the microphone.

591
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:55,320
It's like when you turn the microphone on.

592
00:31:55,320 --> 00:31:56,320
Sure.

593
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:59,080
They find that their world and characters are quite prominent in their dreams.

594
00:31:59,080 --> 00:32:03,680
Oh yeah, like I have this character I've been writing about, Dracula.

595
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:05,520
Right.

596
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:07,720
He keeps showing up in my dreams.

597
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:08,720
He's like, "Aaah!"

598
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:10,560
And I'm like, "Aaah!"

599
00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:13,000
And then I wake up.

600
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:19,160
I've actually been working on a short piece that's been infecting my dreams lately.

601
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:23,240
It's called "A Missive for a Matriarch" and it's actually about Patrick's mom.

602
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:26,520
And I've actually been dreaming about it twice a night.

603
00:32:26,520 --> 00:32:29,880
She got you guys Christmas presents and you still make fun of her on here?

604
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:32,800
I didn't make fun of anything, my dear friend.

605
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:34,560
You guys disgust me.

606
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:40,960
How could I make light of such a beautiful maiden such as your mother?

607
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:42,960
She is the one who makes light.

608
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:48,240
brings light into this world. Like you. I have to add that line. One second guys. I

609
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:51,360
dream about my stories all the time. Usually it ends up being me and my

610
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:54,960
friends with the personalities of the characters that are most like us.

611
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:59,680
Sometimes I dream about my characters. They can wake me up in an ungodly hour.

612
00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:03,040
And I have to write the dream in my journal there and then or I fear of

613
00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:08,600
losing a potentially good piece forever. I mean who hasn't had that moment as a

614
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:16,200
a writer. Waking up, you're in a cold sweat, you're so possessed by the spirit of the dream

615
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:22,640
that you just had that you have to run to your typewriter and you have to write about

616
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:25,400
having a fart power at your middle school.

617
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:31,440
Yeah, you write, you get to the typewriter, you sit there, you write down, "I was naked

618
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:36,160
at school and there was a test that day and all my teeth fell out."

619
00:33:36,160 --> 00:33:38,160
Oh how deliciously lowbrow.

620
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:44,000
What? I actually love indulging in that kind of

621
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:48,320
lowbrow pulpy if you will kind of writing.

622
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:50,560
I sit down at the typewriter some days and I think

623
00:33:50,560 --> 00:33:53,280
let me allow myself to play in the mud today.

624
00:33:53,280 --> 00:34:00,080
What would a moron write? What would an absolute moron write?

625
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:03,440
Oh I have an idea and then you go.

626
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:08,640
and then you just let it run free like a hog across the countryside.

627
00:34:08,640 --> 00:34:11,760
You should write that down.

628
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:19,040
Number three, they're able to tell what another writer was feeling when writing a story.

629
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:19,200
Definitely.

630
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:25,840
I mean, that is so, to me, that's like huge. It's like, because I'm also, I'm a writer/empath.

631
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:26,960
That's what my LinkedIn says.

632
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:27,680
Bibliopath.

633
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:40,560
Yeah, exactly. So I feel kind of exactly what like, for example, like, when I read Huck Finn,

634
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:46,640
I feel racist. Yeah, you know what I mean? Yeah, definitely. When I've been reading this list,

635
00:34:46,640 --> 00:34:54,560
I mean, I can tell that this person was sophisticated. And yet odd. When I read Mark

636
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:59,520
Fisher I feel dead it's really I mean like I it's an incredible power it's

637
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:05,160
crazy you say that too because when I read when I read Shakespeare I also feel

638
00:35:05,160 --> 00:35:12,400
dead and David Foster Wallace too and when I've read David Foster Wallace I

639
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:18,120
feel dead interestingly interestingly when I read the lyrics to Tupac's music

640
00:35:18,120 --> 00:35:22,320
I feel vibrant and full of life and I feel Cuban

641
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:32,000
This entry comes from when I was reading wings of fire book 5

642
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:37,560
It was around then that I truly saw myself as a writer and all of a sudden I saw past the page and into what?

643
00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:40,040
The author felt while writing it's kind of like empathy

644
00:35:40,040 --> 00:35:43,840
I was able to understand what they felt but not through reading expression and vocal tone

645
00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:46,960
Rather, it was through how happy or dark the book was.

646
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:50,920
When any book I read from then on got sad, for example, I remembered losing one of my

647
00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:55,040
own characters and could tell that they too were sad while writing the scene.

648
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:59,080
See my list entry for how characters can seem like real people for a basic explanation for

649
00:35:59,080 --> 00:36:00,560
why the writer was sad.

650
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:01,560
Ugh.

651
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:08,200
I hate losing my characters, but at the same time, I gotta say, kill your darlings.

652
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:10,440
Your darlings need to die.

653
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:11,740
Yup.

654
00:36:11,740 --> 00:36:12,740
They need to die.

655
00:36:12,740 --> 00:36:15,940
Yeah, like the first step to any book like Clementine

656
00:36:15,940 --> 00:36:18,980
Clementine I mean

657
00:36:18,980 --> 00:36:24,980
Darling, I'm in the ground. He should have died. Yes. He should have been he should have been excised

658
00:36:24,980 --> 00:36:29,940
He should have even have been should have been gutted like a pig in the first page or two

659
00:36:29,940 --> 00:36:33,540
Absolutely would have been a much about making the bar feel a rare book

660
00:36:33,540 --> 00:36:35,540
and

661
00:36:35,540 --> 00:36:39,620
Cut out those unnecessary descriptors. It's Harold in the crayon if you please

662
00:36:40,180 --> 00:36:47,360
That's right. We can see that the crayon is purple. There are pictures in the book exactly show don't tell mm-hmm. I can also Harold

663
00:36:47,360 --> 00:36:52,200
Drew Harold removed the crayon across the page and it shines purpley

664
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:54,780
much better

665
00:36:54,780 --> 00:37:00,540
And also there should be more that's a much better title - they're basically only have pictures on every other page

666
00:37:00,540 --> 00:37:02,660
There should be one on every single page. Definitely

667
00:37:02,660 --> 00:37:06,980
It's all about showing and maybe just call the pictures worth a thousand words, you know

668
00:37:06,980 --> 00:37:11,940
That's a lot more words you can fit on a page. So you can write a thousand, you can write a

669
00:37:11,940 --> 00:37:18,740
thousand word book with one picture, they say. They do say that. Number four, they write at odd hours.

670
00:37:18,740 --> 00:37:26,900
Guilty. As charged. That's actually really good. That could actually be a good line of dialogue.

671
00:37:26,900 --> 00:37:31,060
If you want to steal that, I wouldn't mind. I'm all for other writers borrowing my strokes of

672
00:37:31,060 --> 00:37:36,740
of ingenuity. If inspiration hits and I get a eureka moment at 513 a.m. I can't

673
00:37:36,740 --> 00:37:40,220
help but go with it. I read it all times. Mainly though I like to set a time to

674
00:37:40,220 --> 00:37:45,700
sit down and write. Usually around 7 a.m. We all know 513 a.m. Writers are all too

675
00:37:45,700 --> 00:37:52,380
familiar with 513 a.m. They call it the writer's hour for a reason. 513 a.m.

676
00:37:52,380 --> 00:37:59,060
Here's the problem I have with eureka moments. So I I'll wake up maybe like I

677
00:37:59,060 --> 00:38:06,460
know like 4 36 a.m. I'll get up I have a eureka moment I go to the bathroom have a

678
00:38:06,460 --> 00:38:14,300
eureka moment and then it's done and then I go back to bed see you need to

679
00:38:14,300 --> 00:38:18,740
snatch that inspiration from the heavens and actually write it's hard it's paper

680
00:38:18,740 --> 00:38:23,860
it's hard to find time to have a eureka moment when you have roommates that's

681
00:38:23,860 --> 00:38:28,320
also so it is absolutely and and you know I've had roommates who complain they say

682
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:34,060
Caleb at 430 in the morning last night, you know, I have work at 6, I can't just hear you

683
00:38:34,060 --> 00:38:39,140
in your room going "Eureka!" over and over again, you know what I mean? Like, I see the

684
00:38:39,140 --> 00:38:44,380
glow of the giant blue exclamation point above your head coming out from under the door,

685
00:38:44,380 --> 00:38:49,900
like it's actually, it's pretty disruptive. And I say, "Uh, well here's an idea, go fuck

686
00:38:49,900 --> 00:38:50,900
yourself."

687
00:38:50,900 --> 00:38:51,900
That's right.

688
00:38:51,900 --> 00:38:52,900
You say that?

689
00:38:52,900 --> 00:38:56,860
Yeah, because art, I don't care if people get hurt while I'm trying to create art.

690
00:38:56,860 --> 00:39:01,720
Imagine the clatter of my typewriter keys is the is the pattering of rain against your window

691
00:39:01,720 --> 00:39:06,440
and let it lull you into a dreamless sleep where you hopefully stay forever my friend.

692
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:09,360
Yeah I would never say that to my roommate.

693
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:15,360
Imagine the sound of my Razor Black Widow Ultimate Mechanical Keyboard with Cherry MX

694
00:39:15,360 --> 00:39:16,360
keys.

695
00:39:16,360 --> 00:39:20,320
Like imagine that the switches that I'm hitting that sound oh so loud.

696
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:25,160
Imagine they're gunshots in war-torn Syria and you have to sleep one last night because

697
00:39:25,160 --> 00:39:30,780
you never know which one will be your last. Wow. That's right. Oh, how I would love to

698
00:39:30,780 --> 00:39:36,280
rent a cabin in Syria and stay for a month to complete my novel. Now that would bring

699
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:41,660
delightful inspiration to my writing. Amazing. I've looked for Airbnbs in Aleppo, but they're

700
00:39:41,660 --> 00:39:47,940
actually very expensive. I went to, see I went to an Airbnb one time and I went looked

701
00:39:47,940 --> 00:39:53,540
at the spice cabinet and they had Aleppo in there. See now that's something you could

702
00:39:53,540 --> 00:39:59,540
write about you know to us people in the west Aleppo is a spice to the people in

703
00:39:59,540 --> 00:40:08,900
the Far East which is what I call Syria Aleppo is actually a city. Is that what

704
00:40:08,900 --> 00:40:14,940
it's from? So that's what we in writing in English in language call a dichotomy.

705
00:40:14,940 --> 00:40:21,820
Yes. See I'm learning a lot here as a mentally challenged man I don't I'm not

706
00:40:21,820 --> 00:40:27,660
a very skilled writer and that is a unique perspective to write from.

707
00:40:27,660 --> 00:40:28,660
I guess that is true.

708
00:40:28,660 --> 00:40:29,660
Tell your story.

709
00:40:29,660 --> 00:40:34,020
Hey, don't doubt it's not mentally challenged, it's mentally invalid.

710
00:40:34,020 --> 00:40:38,220
Patrick, I just I want you to sit down and I want you to write your story.

711
00:40:38,220 --> 00:40:40,420
I want to see your franchise launch.

712
00:40:40,420 --> 00:40:42,460
I want to see your first novel.

713
00:40:42,460 --> 00:40:43,820
See when I was in...

714
00:40:43,820 --> 00:40:49,460
Patty Doren and the and the push or pull door.

715
00:40:49,460 --> 00:40:50,900
When I was in school...

716
00:40:50,900 --> 00:40:52,900
The mystery of the push door.

717
00:40:52,900 --> 00:40:56,100
When I was in school, we had a...

718
00:40:56,100 --> 00:41:02,660
And the answer to the mystery is printed upside down at the bottom of every page.

719
00:41:02,660 --> 00:41:04,540
Patrick approached the target.

720
00:41:04,540 --> 00:41:08,260
It was red like an apple.

721
00:41:08,260 --> 00:41:11,700
There was a ball outside that was round like a ball.

722
00:41:11,700 --> 00:41:12,700
He looked...

723
00:41:12,700 --> 00:41:14,420
And it bounced like a ball bouncing.

724
00:41:14,420 --> 00:41:16,360
He investigated the door.

725
00:41:16,360 --> 00:41:21,320
The answer to whether it was push or pull was apparent, but it was facing the wrong way

726
00:41:21,320 --> 00:41:24,560
for the people leaving the store.

727
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:26,880
Therefore impossible to decipher.

728
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:28,040
Patrick tried to leave the store.

729
00:41:28,040 --> 00:41:31,120
Upon trying to leave the store, Patrick discovered it was closed.

730
00:41:31,120 --> 00:41:36,060
The outside was closed and he couldn't go through.

731
00:41:36,060 --> 00:41:40,920
And then a hundred pages later, Patrick realizes, in fact, that it was the open sign, the back

732
00:41:40,920 --> 00:41:42,600
of the open sign on the door.

733
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:43,600
Wow.

734
00:41:43,600 --> 00:41:44,600
Wow.

735
00:41:44,600 --> 00:41:45,600
Moving.

736
00:41:45,600 --> 00:41:53,120
See, I thought that the sign said nope.

737
00:41:53,120 --> 00:41:57,480
Number five, they look at the small unneeded details in everything.

738
00:41:57,480 --> 00:41:58,480
Oh.

739
00:41:58,480 --> 00:42:02,800
See, that's, I mean, leave it to me to notice a molecule, ladies and gentlemen.

740
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:03,800
Absolutely.

741
00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:07,360
Because I actually do notice molecules on almost everything that I eat.

742
00:42:07,360 --> 00:42:08,360
I do.

743
00:42:08,360 --> 00:42:13,840
I can tell you just this morning, I saw it when my girlfriend was getting ready for work,

744
00:42:13,840 --> 00:42:18,200
I looked at her and I told her, "Did you do something different with your dust?"

745
00:42:18,200 --> 00:42:24,880
Hmm, I can actually tell that the hairs on your body have grown.

746
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:31,880
I saw some molecules in my bathroom this morning.

747
00:42:31,880 --> 00:42:36,920
I left some molecules on the seat and I immediately wiped them off.

748
00:42:36,920 --> 00:42:38,440
Every writer's bane.

749
00:42:38,440 --> 00:42:39,440
What did you...

750
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:40,480
Wait, Patrick, you're almost there.

751
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:43,400
What did you wipe them off like?

752
00:42:43,400 --> 00:42:48,200
as if they were like a maid

753
00:42:48,200 --> 00:42:49,320
that's that's

754
00:42:49,320 --> 00:42:51,200
all right getting their you're getting there

755
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:55,040
i wipe them off like my family's made should have

756
00:42:55,040 --> 00:42:56,480
yes

757
00:42:56,480 --> 00:42:58,680
much better now we're talking

758
00:42:58,680 --> 00:43:02,840
now you're going to see us we'll make a writer of you yet my friend see this is as somebody

759
00:43:02,840 --> 00:43:04,120
who's a part of your

760
00:43:04,120 --> 00:43:07,120
uh... the caleb and cameron writing school

761
00:43:07,120 --> 00:43:08,920
an academy rather

762
00:43:08,920 --> 00:43:11,920
the caleb and cameron writing academy i'm learning

763
00:43:11,920 --> 00:43:15,440
I'm learning so much and my parents are paying so much for me to learn.

764
00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:21,720
Caleb and Cameron's Learnatorium for Languatology.

765
00:43:21,720 --> 00:43:22,720
And graffiti.

766
00:43:22,720 --> 00:43:27,720
And hip hop.

767
00:43:27,720 --> 00:43:31,080
Because the two are so connected.

768
00:43:31,080 --> 00:43:33,080
Can we talk about that for a second?

769
00:43:33,080 --> 00:43:36,040
I mean hip hop is what?

770
00:43:36,040 --> 00:43:38,640
Without hip hop there would be no Moby Dick.

771
00:43:38,640 --> 00:43:41,640
There would be no William Shakespeare.

772
00:43:41,640 --> 00:43:43,040
No, James Joyce.

773
00:43:43,040 --> 00:43:46,140
Moby Dick, by the way, is one of the most fantastic authors I've ever read.

774
00:43:46,140 --> 00:43:49,040
If you have not read his works, you have to check them out.

775
00:43:49,040 --> 00:43:52,440
I urge you to pick up something of his.

776
00:43:52,440 --> 00:43:54,520
Also support your local library.

777
00:43:54,520 --> 00:43:55,740
Okay?

778
00:43:55,740 --> 00:43:56,740
Support it.

779
00:43:56,740 --> 00:43:58,600
Go in there, rent out one of the computers.

780
00:43:58,600 --> 00:44:01,620
It's $2 an hour and play Fortnite.

781
00:44:01,620 --> 00:44:07,580
You can also use the library computers to look up recipes and other different types

782
00:44:07,580 --> 00:44:10,360
of ways to make napalm.

783
00:44:10,360 --> 00:44:13,440
And you can look that up in the library and they can't,

784
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:16,000
you can't get in trouble for it at the library

785
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:16,840
because it's public.

786
00:44:16,840 --> 00:44:18,720
- Yeah, anything you look up, it's completely untraceable.

787
00:44:18,720 --> 00:44:20,120
You're never gonna know it was you.

788
00:44:20,120 --> 00:44:22,780
- I mean, unless somebody looks over your shoulder,

789
00:44:22,780 --> 00:44:25,580
not your problem.

790
00:44:25,580 --> 00:44:28,680
You can torrent things at the library.

791
00:44:28,680 --> 00:44:30,400
You can look up how to make bombs.

792
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:33,800
You can type in ascendants that I can't say,

793
00:44:33,800 --> 00:44:37,720
but you can type it in on the library and it's fine.

794
00:44:37,720 --> 00:44:43,040
I have to say I respect the library as a place of learning but I haven't been able to go

795
00:44:43,040 --> 00:44:47,520
in there since they started they added DVDs to their offerings it fills me with unspeakable

796
00:44:47,520 --> 00:44:48,520
rage.

797
00:44:48,520 --> 00:44:53,360
I haven't been able to go in there since they banned me from going in there.

798
00:44:53,360 --> 00:44:55,400
How did they ban you from going in there or why?

799
00:44:55,400 --> 00:45:00,760
It's not important okay I'm showing not telling I'll leave it at that.

800
00:45:02,760 --> 00:45:15,040
template oh ha ah ah gassed ah ah zoons ah gadzooks this is the truth to me oh

801
00:45:15,040 --> 00:45:22,360
a lot right if this is not me reality as a template you know I look at I look at

802
00:45:22,360 --> 00:45:29,840
a bus and I think hmm maybe I put a bus in my story I put a big yellow bus into

803
00:45:29,840 --> 00:45:40,720
story next time definitely I also I I wrote an example of this that people is a

804
00:45:40,720 --> 00:45:44,720
fun fact about one of my works is my everybody might remember my the period

805
00:45:44,720 --> 00:45:51,120
piece I wrote about yeah first female serial killer which was actually called

806
00:45:51,120 --> 00:45:56,000
period piece it was a bit of a bit of a wordplay a bit of a wordplay yes because

807
00:45:56,000 --> 00:46:03,500
It was based on my wife. I actually used that as a template to create this

808
00:46:03,500 --> 00:46:09,800
curdled woman. Yeah. I never read that. Blackened soul. I just learned how to

809
00:46:09,800 --> 00:46:13,260
read. I'm glad you didn't read that because you were a character in there

810
00:46:13,260 --> 00:46:16,960
too, my friend. Was I really? Every writer puts their friends into their

811
00:46:16,960 --> 00:46:22,200
works and let me tell you it's not always what they want to read. Of course.

812
00:46:22,200 --> 00:46:28,880
I mean I have you you're in my book as a as a character named sir poop poops Lee I

813
00:46:28,880 --> 00:46:31,560
Have a very interesting that he said

814
00:46:31,560 --> 00:46:36,640
Is that okay? Well you can language listen what language is that in and what does it translate to?

815
00:46:36,640 --> 00:46:42,720
Listen pal you can pick up a copy of my book at your local Barnes and Noble all right and don't go

816
00:46:42,720 --> 00:46:48,620
Getting it from any archive org because and how did I get to archive org?

817
00:46:49,520 --> 00:46:53,720
Well, you probably can't get to archive.org because me and Cameron are in the process

818
00:46:53,720 --> 00:46:55,320
of suing them into oblivion.

819
00:46:55,320 --> 00:46:56,320
Oh, really?

820
00:46:56,320 --> 00:46:59,560
Where they're hopefully going to shut down, yes, because it is an evil...

821
00:46:59,560 --> 00:47:03,560
I mean, information should be anything but free, right?

822
00:47:03,560 --> 00:47:04,560
Definitely.

823
00:47:04,560 --> 00:47:07,160
You should be working to earn information.

824
00:47:07,160 --> 00:47:09,600
What is knowledge but currency?

825
00:47:09,600 --> 00:47:12,800
I agree with this.

826
00:47:12,800 --> 00:47:19,160
There's so much information I just don't care to pay for and I don't want to pay for.

827
00:47:19,160 --> 00:47:23,560
There's so many things that I could have learned and I just didn't want to pay for it.

828
00:47:23,560 --> 00:47:25,520
I'd rather go and buy extravagant meals.

829
00:47:25,520 --> 00:47:28,320
You my friend should be on the gallows.

830
00:47:28,320 --> 00:47:29,680
Why?

831
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:30,680
What is a gallow?

832
00:47:30,680 --> 00:47:32,520
Ah, to be so ignorant.

833
00:47:32,520 --> 00:47:35,760
Pick up a thesaurus for once in your life, my friend.

834
00:47:35,760 --> 00:47:36,760
What is that?

835
00:47:36,760 --> 00:47:39,160
Pick up a dictionary for once in your life.

836
00:47:39,160 --> 00:47:42,440
He probably thinks it's an ancient reptile.

837
00:47:42,440 --> 00:47:44,800
From where?

838
00:47:44,800 --> 00:47:45,800
Some primeval beast.

839
00:47:45,800 --> 00:47:47,800
Probably crossed his mind.

840
00:47:47,800 --> 00:47:49,800
*laughs*

841
00:47:49,800 --> 00:47:51,800
Oh, the imbecility-ness.

842
00:47:51,800 --> 00:47:57,800
My friend, my friend, you, my friend would be the leader in a cuckistocracy.

843
00:47:57,800 --> 00:47:59,800
I know what caca is.

844
00:47:59,800 --> 00:48:01,800
I'm sure you do.

845
00:48:01,800 --> 00:48:05,800
Because it drips from your ears when you think too hard.

846
00:48:05,800 --> 00:48:09,800
*laughs*

847
00:48:09,800 --> 00:48:13,800
Oh, the delicious hilarity of the situation at hand.

848
00:48:13,800 --> 00:48:20,800
7. They push on, despite knowing that their project may not be excellent.

849
00:48:20,800 --> 00:48:29,120
to this. No. You're a bit of a quitter. No, no. I've just never written anything that I

850
00:48:29,120 --> 00:48:37,200
would deem subpar. I'm sorry I have a higher standard for it. Have you ever thought about

851
00:48:37,200 --> 00:48:45,680
how you actually want to be under par? And that the word subpar actually makes no sense.

852
00:48:45,680 --> 00:48:49,880
This is actually something I meditated on during one of my retreats. Where have you

853
00:48:49,880 --> 00:49:02,200
you

854
00:49:02,200 --> 00:49:15,400
this I can relate to. I've been working on my book about a bug for... I've been writing it,

855
00:49:15,400 --> 00:49:20,520
rewriting it. It's a tough nut to crack. Actually, this isn't... if you wouldn't mind,

856
00:49:20,520 --> 00:49:27,480
I can read a passage from one of my horror novels. I would adore to do such a thing.

857
00:49:27,480 --> 00:49:33,000
The Beast of the Bloody Land that actually demonstrates this point.

858
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:34,920
Ah yes, go on.

859
00:49:34,920 --> 00:49:37,720
I rewrote stuff quite a bit for this book.

860
00:49:37,720 --> 00:49:40,680
Let me read this passage right here.

861
00:49:40,680 --> 00:49:47,160
The Beast of the Bloody Land was very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very,

862
00:49:47,160 --> 00:49:55,480
very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very,

863
00:49:55,480 --> 00:49:59,640
very scary and I really that were very

864
00:49:59,640 --> 00:50:03,360
a-ha a-ha I mean I think I speak for myself

865
00:50:03,360 --> 00:50:07,240
Patrick the audience when I say bone-chilling my friend rocked me to my

866
00:50:07,240 --> 00:50:07,920
core

867
00:50:07,920 --> 00:50:14,600
my very essence was harmed by that story and that's only two pages of it

868
00:50:14,600 --> 00:50:18,600
wow scared me a number eight the

869
00:50:18,600 --> 00:50:22,640
they remake the same thing many times only to get it right once

870
00:50:22,640 --> 00:50:24,640
I mean, again...

871
00:50:24,640 --> 00:50:31,640
I mean, this goes double for people who write cookbooks.

872
00:50:31,640 --> 00:50:39,640
And cookbooks is... some people say that cookbooks are a lower form of literature. I disagree.

873
00:50:39,640 --> 00:50:45,640
I think that... I don't know if you've read Binging with Babish. He's one of my favorite authors recently.

874
00:50:45,640 --> 00:50:51,640
I mean, he's just... the way that he puts together ingredients, it's almost poetic.

875
00:50:51,640 --> 00:50:54,560
Mm-hmm and ingredients are the words are the words of food

876
00:50:54,560 --> 00:50:59,520
Exactly, and the way that he somehow ties these ingredients to

877
00:50:59,520 --> 00:51:07,800
Television movies video game. I mean, it's it's it's truly an amazing piece of work another very underrated

878
00:51:07,800 --> 00:51:10,320
form of writing along with cookbooks is

879
00:51:10,320 --> 00:51:13,320
the nutrition fact

880
00:51:13,320 --> 00:51:19,320
Yes, no, that's so that's where that is where words in science come together. Yes

881
00:51:19,320 --> 00:51:26,040
normally I would say science and literature completely uncompatible I

882
00:51:26,040 --> 00:51:30,400
would say a match made in heaven but considering we're dealing with science

883
00:51:30,400 --> 00:51:35,800
I'd have to say a match made in a beautiful laboratory mm-hmm a match made

884
00:51:35,800 --> 00:51:43,200
by Stephen Hawking in heaven mm-hmm or hell much like the mouth that's a story

885
00:51:43,200 --> 00:51:50,880
hook much like the matches made between Jeffrey Epstein and Stephen Hawking were

886
00:51:50,880 --> 00:51:53,800
they fucking with each other they were on they went to an island

887
00:51:53,800 --> 00:51:58,320
Stephen Hawking wasn't he was they did a split he was on the island there's no

888
00:51:58,320 --> 00:52:04,760
way yeah look at no actually what spinning and that would be kind of

889
00:52:04,760 --> 00:52:08,040
great escape park on the island for yeah they were spinning him around like the

890
00:52:08,040 --> 00:52:14,480
Fresh Prince intro. That is pretty fucking cool man. He was on the halfpipe. Mm-hmm.

891
00:52:14,480 --> 00:52:23,220
But we digress. But back to the important stuff. Number 10, they write

892
00:52:23,220 --> 00:52:31,480
characters that are totally unlike them. Mm-hmm. I agree. I mean I yeah I mean I've

893
00:52:31,480 --> 00:52:42,480
I've been writing books about mostly people with huge lion's mane hairdos, dreadlocks,

894
00:52:42,480 --> 00:52:49,880
afros, you know, none of which I hold on my head.

895
00:52:49,880 --> 00:52:56,680
I wrote a story, or at least I attempted to write a story.

896
00:52:56,680 --> 00:53:01,680
It was difficult due to how similar the character was to myself.

897
00:53:01,680 --> 00:53:06,680
Sometimes the mirror is ungodly.

898
00:53:06,680 --> 00:53:11,680
Yes, especially when I wake up in the morning.

899
00:53:11,680 --> 00:53:16,680
I can't even look in there. I look at that mirror, I just want to headbutt it.

900
00:53:16,680 --> 00:53:21,680
Well, that's, I mean, a writer's pain is where you get your inspiration from.

901
00:53:21,680 --> 00:53:28,120
from. Absolutely. Yeah well anyway I tried to write a story about a guy who was six

902
00:53:28,120 --> 00:53:35,720
feet tall and I got so upset just imagining a world. It was too close to you. Because it's

903
00:53:35,720 --> 00:53:42,960
too it's too. The concept was too big for you to grapple with I understand.

904
00:53:42,960 --> 00:53:48,080
It was a high concept. It disgusted me that somebody could be that tall

905
00:53:48,080 --> 00:53:51,360
tall and I forgot what I said at the beginning of this.

906
00:53:51,360 --> 00:53:52,360
I forgot.

907
00:53:52,360 --> 00:53:53,360
Wait, hold on.

908
00:53:53,360 --> 00:53:55,400
Here, let me read a comment here.

909
00:53:55,400 --> 00:53:59,600
It was actually, it was actually easier to write a story about a guy who was six feet

910
00:53:59,600 --> 00:54:00,920
tall than it was.

911
00:54:00,920 --> 00:54:03,120
God damn it.

912
00:54:03,120 --> 00:54:06,440
So that my friend, you should have utilized a first and final draft.

913
00:54:06,440 --> 00:54:07,440
Yeah.

914
00:54:07,440 --> 00:54:12,840
A bit of writer lingo that you may not be familiar with, but I urge you to check out ask.com

915
00:54:12,840 --> 00:54:13,840
to discover it.

916
00:54:13,840 --> 00:54:14,840
One of the writers greatest tools.

917
00:54:14,840 --> 00:54:16,840
Similar to askjeeves.com?

918
00:54:16,840 --> 00:54:23,640
Ask Jeeves, any writer who uses Ask Jeeves should be excommunicated, uh, for writing culture.

919
00:54:23,640 --> 00:54:28,600
And here's the thing, what's, it's so frustrating is back in the day if you wanted to learn

920
00:54:28,600 --> 00:54:34,280
something, right, you would, you would crack open a book, right? Right. Crack open an encyclopedia

921
00:54:34,280 --> 00:54:39,080
and you'd learn about it. Nowadays, these kids have Ask Jeeves in their pocket, right? It's true.

922
00:54:39,080 --> 00:54:42,160
They're asking Jeeves every damn question.

923
00:54:42,160 --> 00:54:45,160
Whatever happened to the beauty of mystery?

924
00:54:45,160 --> 00:54:46,960
Now ask Jeeves.

925
00:54:46,960 --> 00:54:49,720
Well Jeeves got all the answers.

926
00:54:49,720 --> 00:54:53,480
I have half a mind to put out a hit on this Jeeves fella.

927
00:54:53,480 --> 00:54:55,420
Hold on I've got to write that down.

928
00:54:55,420 --> 00:54:57,000
Now that's a story.

929
00:54:57,000 --> 00:55:00,480
Jeeves has to be one of the smartest people in the world.

930
00:55:00,480 --> 00:55:01,920
This fucking guy knows everything.

931
00:55:01,920 --> 00:55:04,880
Also for a butler, pretty impressive.

932
00:55:04,880 --> 00:55:05,960
Here's a comment here.

933
00:55:05,960 --> 00:55:09,600
It's fun writing characters that differ completely from your own character.

934
00:55:09,600 --> 00:55:14,000
I love writing in the viewpoint and voice of rather bolshy, loud, and arrogant males, or

935
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:16,740
cunning and manipulative females.

936
00:55:16,740 --> 00:55:20,040
It's just fun experimenting with different styles and viewpoints and seeing how far you

937
00:55:20,040 --> 00:55:21,620
can stretch your imagination.

938
00:55:21,620 --> 00:55:25,480
It's a most satisfactory feeling when you feel you've accomplished it.

939
00:55:25,480 --> 00:55:28,900
Oh, how I despise bolshy males.

940
00:55:28,900 --> 00:55:33,280
Cunning and manipulative females, hey, what are you, writing a story about every woman?

941
00:55:33,280 --> 00:55:34,280
Come on.

942
00:55:34,280 --> 00:55:36,200
Authors Bane, my friend.

943
00:55:36,200 --> 00:55:39,280
The author's bane is a woman.

944
00:55:39,280 --> 00:55:42,280
The woman is like, I think it was Mark Twain who said-

945
00:55:42,280 --> 00:55:45,280
The woman is like the whiteout to your writing progress.

946
00:55:45,280 --> 00:55:48,280
The woman is the whole of the world.

947
00:55:48,280 --> 00:55:52,280
I think Mark Twain said.

948
00:55:52,280 --> 00:55:55,280
Here's another comment from Max Aurelius.

949
00:55:55,280 --> 00:55:58,280
How is this unusual? And then he amended it.

950
00:55:58,280 --> 00:56:00,280
Edit. Again a year later.

951
00:56:00,280 --> 00:56:03,280
I kind of think the comment I made was unnecessary and kind of hypocritical of me

952
00:56:03,280 --> 00:56:07,720
critical of me considering I was and still am an avid writer.

953
00:56:07,720 --> 00:56:09,960
Now here's a man who can recognize his mistakes.

954
00:56:09,960 --> 00:56:11,120
Evolution, you know what I mean?

955
00:56:11,120 --> 00:56:14,860
That's a huge part of the writer's...

956
00:56:14,860 --> 00:56:16,240
Evolution is a huge part.

957
00:56:16,240 --> 00:56:21,280
I mean, it's like an orphanage, right?

958
00:56:21,280 --> 00:56:25,680
You take all your budding story ideas, you throw them into a pool together, you see who

959
00:56:25,680 --> 00:56:27,760
sinks and who swims.

960
00:56:27,760 --> 00:56:34,040
It's only the survivor you wish to adopt and raise into a fully-fledged adult with a beginning,

961
00:56:34,040 --> 00:56:36,960
middle, and end.

962
00:56:36,960 --> 00:56:41,360
Real quick, let's do this other list by...

963
00:56:41,360 --> 00:56:42,360
Really?

964
00:56:42,360 --> 00:56:44,360
Yeah, we can run through this.

965
00:56:44,360 --> 00:56:45,760
We've got three and a half minutes.

966
00:56:45,760 --> 00:56:47,360
Hey, that's okay with me.

967
00:56:47,360 --> 00:56:50,240
Top 10 things writers are sick of hearing.

968
00:56:50,240 --> 00:56:52,520
So number one is put me in the story.

969
00:56:52,520 --> 00:56:54,200
I mean, I think we've all struggled with this.

970
00:56:54,200 --> 00:56:55,920
I'm rageful just hearing that.

971
00:56:55,920 --> 00:56:56,920
Yes.

972
00:56:56,920 --> 00:56:58,920
I'm full of vengeful hate.

973
00:56:58,920 --> 00:57:00,920
I'm full of chips.

974
00:57:00,920 --> 00:57:02,920
I'm so full.

975
00:57:02,920 --> 00:57:04,920
Maybe I will put you in the story.

976
00:57:04,920 --> 00:57:06,920
As a toilet.

977
00:57:06,920 --> 00:57:10,920
I'm going to name the toilet in the story after you.

978
00:57:10,920 --> 00:57:12,920
Are you happy now mom?

979
00:57:12,920 --> 00:57:14,920
Megalomaniacal sex criminal.

980
00:57:14,920 --> 00:57:21,920
Or maybe even one of the dookies that my main character takes and puts inside of the toilet that's also named after you.

981
00:57:21,920 --> 00:57:24,920
You fucking asshat for an ass.

982
00:57:24,920 --> 00:57:26,920
You ass clown.

983
00:57:26,920 --> 00:57:29,920
Oh yeah, and good luck trying to debate a writer.

984
00:57:29,920 --> 00:57:33,920
Oh, our insults are on another level.

985
00:57:33,920 --> 00:57:36,920
I will tear you to shreds, you shit fucker.

986
00:57:36,920 --> 00:57:41,920
Linguistic shreds, you farting shit fat ass.

987
00:57:41,920 --> 00:57:43,920
You dookie rat.

988
00:57:43,920 --> 00:57:45,920
You smelly smucker.

989
00:57:45,920 --> 00:57:48,920
You sharder of a shit.

990
00:57:48,920 --> 00:57:52,920
You, you, you imbecile.

991
00:57:52,920 --> 00:58:03,680
You dumb poop. Did you hear that one? Did you hear that? I learned that just now. You crap shit.

992
00:58:03,680 --> 00:58:10,600
You are a shit. What's this? A shit from a crap's ass. Yes. Talking dookie about

993
00:58:10,600 --> 00:58:15,960
about a shitter again. My friend, it seems all five senses rather than just one are

994
00:58:15,960 --> 00:58:18,400
registering the smell of a fart in your presence.

995
00:58:18,400 --> 00:58:22,400
Hmm I fart in your general direction.

996
00:58:22,400 --> 00:58:24,400
Monty Python.

997
00:58:24,400 --> 00:58:28,400
Monty Python also one of the greatest writers of our generation.

998
00:58:28,400 --> 00:58:31,400
Yeah, his movies were so crazy.

999
00:58:31,400 --> 00:58:34,400
Check out his graphic novelization of the Book of Mormon.

1000
00:58:34,400 --> 00:58:36,400
Oh, wrong one.

1001
00:58:36,400 --> 00:58:39,400
Yeah, you were thinking of Terry Gilliam.

1002
00:58:39,400 --> 00:58:41,400
I was thinking of South and Park.

1003
00:58:41,400 --> 00:58:45,400
Now tell me that you guys have never heard this before.

1004
00:58:45,400 --> 00:58:47,520
Writer's block doesn't matter.

1005
00:58:47,520 --> 00:58:49,240
Just keep going.

1006
00:58:49,240 --> 00:58:50,240
Oh my god.

1007
00:58:50,240 --> 00:58:51,240
Oh, yeah, sure.

1008
00:58:51,240 --> 00:58:55,760
I wish the writer's block was physical so I could bash my parents over the head with

1009
00:58:55,760 --> 00:58:58,280
it when they bring this up at dinner.

1010
00:58:58,280 --> 00:59:04,000
I wish that it was a wooden block that I could stand on to reach things that were taller than

1011
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:05,000
me in the pantry.

1012
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:11,680
See, now I wish it was more like a question mark block and I could just keep hitting it

1013
00:59:11,680 --> 00:59:17,120
until money comes out to fund my various novels and projects.

1014
00:59:17,120 --> 00:59:20,320
What's this, a coin shiny in gold as the surface of the sun?

1015
00:59:20,320 --> 00:59:24,480
Finding funding as an author is one of the greatest

1016
00:59:24,480 --> 00:59:28,960
banes of my existence and one of the author's banes as well. I mean,

1017
00:59:28,960 --> 00:59:34,960
one of my last books I wrote had a massive spaceflight sequence spanning almost 30 pages,

1018
00:59:34,960 --> 00:59:39,920
and it cost upwards of $30 million to put that to the page.

1019
00:59:39,920 --> 00:59:41,440
Wow. Wow.

1020
00:59:41,440 --> 00:59:47,960
because I needed to I as every writer does I needed to compose CGI footage video

1021
00:59:47,960 --> 00:59:52,040
footage of the scene so I could describe it and put it to the page how am I

1022
00:59:52,040 --> 00:59:56,200
supposed to describe something that I can't see I can't I can't I can't walk

1023
00:59:56,200 --> 01:00:00,960
outside and and and look at a spaceship shooting a laser that's why that's why

1024
01:00:00,960 --> 01:00:05,480
until I got a budget my lab my first 20 books were all about homeless people

1025
01:00:05,480 --> 01:00:08,160
asking me for money because that's what happens when I go outside that's what I

1026
01:00:08,160 --> 01:00:17,700
see in my life. Wow. And we can end on... And that's truly something that I don't

1027
01:00:17,700 --> 01:00:23,280
experience but I mean hearing it from you... And we can end on this.

1028
01:00:23,280 --> 01:00:28,400
This is... I will say I didn't know where I was going until I got the 30 million dollars.

1029
01:00:28,400 --> 01:00:35,780
This is... you must be a terrible speller. Okay. Right? Yeah. Been there. Okay.

1030
01:00:35,780 --> 01:00:40,780
Maybe the word flop has a curly bracket in it, okay?

1031
01:00:40,780 --> 01:00:44,120
Did you never consider that, right?

1032
01:00:44,120 --> 01:00:46,340
And then here's the comment,

1033
01:00:46,340 --> 01:00:49,900
"Oh, come on, we writers do go back over and fix spelling

1034
01:00:49,900 --> 01:00:52,180
"into not that big of a deal."

1035
01:00:52,180 --> 01:00:54,340
And that's from I love to read and write.

1036
01:00:54,340 --> 01:00:57,180
(laughing)

1037
01:00:57,180 --> 01:00:58,020
- Wow.

1038
01:00:58,020 --> 01:00:58,840
- I mean.

1039
01:00:58,840 --> 01:00:59,840
- I love to read and write.

1040
01:00:59,840 --> 01:01:02,080
I'm actually very upset that this person

1041
01:01:02,080 --> 01:01:03,340
has this username on this website

1042
01:01:03,340 --> 01:01:05,540
'cause that's my username on every other social media,

1043
01:01:05,540 --> 01:01:11,220
but I had to be I love to write to on the top tens because of this freak you should

1044
01:01:11,220 --> 01:01:17,780
you should message them oh I already have times graphically threateningly to the

1045
01:01:17,780 --> 01:01:25,180
point where I'm in big trouble often copied never replicated okay and I would

1046
01:01:25,180 --> 01:01:30,820
like to bid our audience a great adieu oh I do and once I once I find out what

1047
01:01:30,820 --> 01:01:33,220
That means I can say it too.

1048
01:01:33,220 --> 01:01:35,020
Au revoir.

1049
01:01:35,020 --> 01:01:38,620
Then I do this again when I find out.

1050
01:01:38,620 --> 01:01:42,520
And let me and let me just say the end.

1051
01:01:42,520 --> 01:01:43,220
Wow.
