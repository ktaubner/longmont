1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,500
I

2
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:09,460
okay,

3
00:00:09,460 --> 00:00:13,300
you can't do that. I clap keep that in the

4
00:00:13,300 --> 00:00:19,740
way. Okay, clap clap for real. I did clap. I heard you already. You didn't

5
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:20,480
miss the way

6
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:27,800
did you ever know how to do a turbo far with your leg with my leg where you put

7
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:31,840
you do that, but you put it under your knees and then you put your legs under

8
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:33,840
your knees and they could go.

9
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:37,840
That shit made me laugh in gym class.

10
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:39,840
Let's see.

11
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:41,840
My hands are too dry right now.

12
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:42,840
I've never been able to do that, man.

13
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:45,840
I've been able to do it a few times, but my hands don't get so wet, maybe.

14
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:49,840
Speaking of farts, I seriously think yesterday,

15
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:52,840
I think, and I already, Juby already heard this.

16
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:53,840
You had a turd blast?

17
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:55,840
No. Well, yes. But I think that I farted.

18
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:56,840
Go figure.

19
00:00:56,840 --> 00:01:02,280
here. I think I farted and I think I genuinely ripped my asshole. Yeah, when I

20
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:06,880
was a lot fatter, I used to get that did nothing for you. No, you had to be at

21
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:10,600
this. I asshole's been hurting for two days. I think buddy, I think it means

22
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:11,600
you're getting it.

23
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:18,540
You think I'm getting fat fat people fart hard. I used to when I was when I was a

24
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:22,200
lot bigger when I was like two hundred thirty pounds. I

25
00:01:23,860 --> 00:01:29,660
I think I had hemorrhoids, maybe when I was I never farted once when you were

26
00:01:29,660 --> 00:01:32,740
three hundred and seventy pounds. Yeah, I kind of miss that's what I wait. I'm

27
00:01:32,740 --> 00:01:36,480
just a big Cameron. Yeah, yes, you're going around like a balloon. We used to

28
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:36,940
play

29
00:01:36,940 --> 00:01:41,580
yesterday. You say yesterday, yesterday, that's fire. Yeah, you do need to lose

30
00:01:41,580 --> 00:01:45,460
some weight. You are disgusting to look at. It's like the whale when I come in

31
00:01:45,460 --> 00:01:48,420
here. Yeah, as you'll be blowing my hole.

32
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:50,620
Damn,

33
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:54,100
Here's what me and Patrick were doing last night.

34
00:01:54,100 --> 00:02:03,100
Every food has its taste, just like every drink has its ice.

35
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:07,100
Just like every...

36
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:09,100
(applause)

37
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:10,100
Pretty good.

38
00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:15,100
Every taco has its hot, hot sauce.

39
00:02:15,100 --> 00:02:18,100
No, that's not true. Not every taco has hot sauce, first of all.

40
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:21,100
Second of all, the funny thing is to make it really big in general.

41
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:25,680
in general. Okay, so maybe every food and drink just like this is just off the

42
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:26,340
top of my head, but

43
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:33,740
blanket every sauce has its cap. The one that was sticking in my head from the

44
00:02:33,740 --> 00:02:39,660
other day that that's been stuck with me was was breaking bad better call. So

45
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:42,700
the wider and adventure time

46
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:45,340
watching TV

47
00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:47,100
watching

48
00:02:49,540 --> 00:02:52,900
oh yeah and is doing ten thousand verse

49
00:02:52,900 --> 00:03:00,300
the office and peep show and also i'm watching what's a one glee. My

50
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:06,860
children are watching shows to they are watching veggie tales, cocoa, melon,

51
00:03:06,860 --> 00:03:10,900
Daniel, tiger, G tails and sponge bob to

52
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:16,620
the big bang theory and also day

53
00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:23,620
Cameron's angle is fucked up again.

54
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:27,620
Cameron angle, like camera angle.

55
00:03:27,620 --> 00:03:30,620
Oh yeah, that's something for sure.

56
00:03:30,620 --> 00:03:33,620
Now we each got our own camera. Wow.

57
00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:35,620
Okay.

58
00:03:35,620 --> 00:03:37,620
Yeah, I haven't been watching much TV recently.

59
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:39,620
I just have been watching TV.

60
00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:43,620
I actually watched a few episodes this week,

61
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:47,780
last week, but honestly it feels wasteful because like I'm waste like

62
00:03:47,780 --> 00:03:51,260
this could be going to someone who wants to watch it. Yes, and they're like I

63
00:03:51,260 --> 00:03:54,920
always think this could be going to this electricity could be going to a

64
00:03:54,920 --> 00:04:00,760
somebody in the dark in Africa, a dark. I don't think they have the I think

65
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:04,260
they all have electricity in Africa. Now you think they all have electricity in

66
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:08,220
Africa. We don't even have electricity in America. Well, I said it faster than

67
00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:12,100
you. So I get you that one. I was trying to think well what I think most here

68
00:04:12,140 --> 00:04:15,840
And then you said in America, so I changed to copy you. Most of Africa has

69
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:21,000
electricity. We need to do an Africa tour. Yeah, I need to be and I'm not

70
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:26,880
saying I'm not saying US. So I want to be in Africa, taking pictures, safari

71
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:31,000
photos of us with a dragon. When I was in or a lion, Mexico,

72
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:36,620
whatever they got in the Serengeti. When I was in a when I was in a Mexico,

73
00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:41,200
and we were hanging out with this couple who was from Europe, and they were

74
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:44,420
tell they were like kind of like those world traveler types where they're

75
00:04:44,420 --> 00:04:49,020
like yeah, I'm from Romania, but we were in like we how we went to Sweden last

76
00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:52,400
like last month or whatever, but they're telling us that they went on a safari in

77
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:56,220
Africa and it sounds like actual hell. It's not like the worst trip you can

78
00:04:56,220 --> 00:05:00,120
ever. It sounds like Africa, it just on a safari because you have to the animals

79
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:04,240
are awake at like only awake at like four AM. You have to you like wake up at

80
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:07,680
three AM and then you like have to go and you have to stay on the move,

81
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:10,980
because if you stay in any one place too long, like the lines and the hyenas will

82
00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:14,260
come get you because you're like sleeping. You know, she was telling us

83
00:05:14,260 --> 00:05:17,780
this thing. We're like she like got up and there was just like a hyena just

84
00:05:17,780 --> 00:05:20,420
watching her and just slowly walking towards her and they gave her a

85
00:05:20,420 --> 00:05:23,460
walkie-talkie to tell if like an animal is coming after them. She's like

86
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:27,220
there's a hyena coming after me and they're just like no respond. The whole

87
00:05:27,220 --> 00:05:32,020
thing with the because hyenas love to laugh well, but so tigers and lions and

88
00:05:32,020 --> 00:05:38,180
bears, oh my all of these creatures, if they're in a zoo or a some kind of

89
00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:42,820
captivity. They're much more likely to attack people because on a safari, they

90
00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:47,700
think that the car is a big thing. They think the car is one big monster.

91
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:53,500
They take the cars and they put like a big vinyl wrap. I don't know.

92
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:58,420
They put a big vinyl wrap over the car to make it look like it's some kind of

93
00:05:58,420 --> 00:06:01,860
like dinosaur, like elephant or something. Because they still got that in

94
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:02,420
their brain.

95
00:06:02,420 --> 00:06:06,780
yeah yeah, that's what they know. What you know the we do they take the red

96
00:06:06,780 --> 00:06:10,660
nose. They take the red nose and there were the antlers and they put on the

97
00:06:10,660 --> 00:06:11,500
car yeah

98
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:17,900
that's one reindeer that no animal would ever put a humans on board bumper

99
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:21,980
sticker. Yeah, a little white lines like oh, oh, I'm not going to I'm not going

100
00:06:21,980 --> 00:06:25,740
to attack this thing yeah, because of the paperwork I'd have to do and like

101
00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:29,500
insurance company. I think that any animal that attacks somebody. Oh, we

102
00:06:29,540 --> 00:06:33,860
didn't talk about the monkey torture thing. Oh yeah, we've been talking about

103
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:34,900
that for years.

104
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:40,540
What do you talk about? We talked about the monkey, the

105
00:06:40,540 --> 00:06:46,300
Facebook page. Yeah, oh, okay, wait, it was that guy from that Facebook. I

106
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:50,020
think so. I think that's well anyway. I think that I mean I don't know if it's

107
00:06:50,020 --> 00:06:54,140
all if I assume that there's probably multiple like kind of splinters cells

108
00:06:54,140 --> 00:06:56,980
and torture groups. Yeah, monkeys, yeah, they're all on telegram because you

109
00:06:57,020 --> 00:07:00,160
but yeah, I imagine that this this torture monkey group maybe might not

110
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:04,300
also be the ones who are all on YouTube. It might not be the same. I didn't read

111
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:06,860
anything about it, but I did see a headline that was like monkey torture. I

112
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:09,760
didn't read all that much about chopping off fingers. Apparently, the guy got

113
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:14,320
started by tickling the yeah or no, not tickling sorry. He was and they call him

114
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:18,780
the torture king baiting him with which say monkey torture king yeah, yeah, he

115
00:07:18,780 --> 00:07:21,400
probably wouldn't be that good at torturing a human. No, he could be

116
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:24,340
really good at torture. I'm not that hard to torture a human because you just

117
00:07:24,380 --> 00:07:28,380
up off the fingers. It's the same thing. He's really good at torturing humans that love

118
00:07:28,380 --> 00:07:32,380
monkeys. That's true. You don't really have to have a mini night system. You don't really

119
00:07:32,380 --> 00:07:35,380
have to have like an imagine, you don't have to really be creative if you're torturing

120
00:07:35,380 --> 00:07:38,380
someone. You just have to do, it's not like you're getting tortured like, "Wow, this guy's

121
00:07:38,380 --> 00:07:42,380
really good at torturing me." He knows, he's coming up with wickedly clever ways to...

122
00:07:42,380 --> 00:07:45,380
I'm going to be honest. Plus they're just copying Saw and Hostile the whole time. I'm

123
00:07:45,380 --> 00:07:48,380
going to be completely honest. I do not understand torture at all. Me neither. And I don't know

124
00:07:48,380 --> 00:07:52,380
why you would do that. Me neither. For information. Straight up. Well, but that's it. But what

125
00:07:52,380 --> 00:07:56,700
you gonna this guy's looking for bananas why is he torturing these monkeys? In cases of

126
00:07:56,700 --> 00:08:03,340
information and maybe power. I think it's about power. Yeah but you already have so much power

127
00:08:03,340 --> 00:08:08,220
over a monkey. Wait not true, not true they got poop powers. No but you can put it in an outfit

128
00:08:08,220 --> 00:08:12,060
you can dress up you can make a monkey look like Mr. Incredible. I think the reason you torture

129
00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:15,500
a monkey is because you realize that you never have power over a monkey because they can just

130
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:19,660
go live in the woods. Yeah but you can do that. No not this. No you can't live in the woods. So

131
00:08:19,660 --> 00:08:22,980
So you think that he tortured these poor little monkeys out of jealousy?

132
00:08:22,980 --> 00:08:26,220
No I think he was a pedophile and that was the closest thing to a kid that he had in

133
00:08:26,220 --> 00:08:27,220
his life.

134
00:08:27,220 --> 00:08:28,220
They were probably jumping on his bed all night.

135
00:08:28,220 --> 00:08:30,100
He had more monkeys in his life than kids?

136
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:31,100
Yeah I think so.

137
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:32,420
Said that in the article.

138
00:08:32,420 --> 00:08:33,420
No it didn't.

139
00:08:33,420 --> 00:08:34,420
I heard it.

140
00:08:34,420 --> 00:08:41,660
I heard the article I read was that he was a doctor and a mommy kept calling him because

141
00:08:41,660 --> 00:08:44,060
they were jumping on the bed.

142
00:08:44,060 --> 00:08:46,780
So he was he's finally snapped.

143
00:08:46,780 --> 00:08:48,380
A mommy monkey?

144
00:08:48,380 --> 00:08:49,380
Yeah.

145
00:08:49,380 --> 00:08:53,320
we call the doctor and the doctor said no more monkeys jumping on the bed and he

146
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:57,380
snapped. Oh, is that would actually be a fucking sick gritty movie to make yeah

147
00:08:57,380 --> 00:09:01,140
the gritty reboot of no more monkeys jumping on the bed doctor coming in

148
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:04,580
and he's like he's like a fucked up like he's a fucked up. That Michael

149
00:09:04,580 --> 00:09:07,820
villain doctor, Michael Shannon face, he has goggles or you can't see his eyes

150
00:09:07,820 --> 00:09:11,420
and it's like let's say handle these monkeys. Let's go talk to these

151
00:09:11,420 --> 00:09:15,180
that would be too scary

152
00:09:16,660 --> 00:09:21,360
and all the monkeys are a g i andy circus down like like serial killer movie,

153
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:24,400
like they're making one of those like jeffrey dommer ted, but yeah and it's

154
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:28,420
like it's like it's the thing where like the neighbor knocks on like

155
00:09:28,420 --> 00:09:33,160
jeffrey dommers doors like it's like it's my neighbor. I like shit near a

156
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:34,820
little weird in here and jeffy. I was like

157
00:09:34,820 --> 00:09:39,160
I don't have a

158
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:47,460
funny buddy. I got oh okay. Hey my bad man. My bad. Hey me and the missus are

159
00:09:47,460 --> 00:09:49,920
having a cookout next week. He's going to come through. Oh that's Smeagol's

160
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:50,280
voice.

161
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:55,000
Not really, it's just an evil voice. It was kind of Smeagol's voice. I could

162
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,740
have, I could have shmeaged it up.

163
00:09:56,740 --> 00:10:00,820
Shmeaged it up. Did you guys play the Smeagol game? No, I want to. It looked

164
00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:03,380
fun, but it should have been. It looked really funny. It should have been, they

165
00:10:03,380 --> 00:10:06,660
put him in New York City, make it like Spider-Man. Yeah. That would be a much

166
00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:10,020
better game. Tell him to make a sequel. If you- Every game should be the main

167
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:14,600
character in New York City. If you are a video game modder, if you mod video

168
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:18,680
games, if that's your thing, if that's your hobby, you get that Smeagol game

169
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:26,680
right now. You change the map to Times Square using Unity or Havoc or whatever

170
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:32,600
engine it was in. You change that map to Times Square. You put a full pedestrian

171
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:39,720
like walking stuff, pedestrian AI, hot dog vendors, Elmo, fucking everything

172
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:44,860
it's in Times Square and Smiegel has to walk up to them and go. I want a video

173
00:10:44,860 --> 00:10:50,480
game where you play as the costume guys in Times Square. Yeah, that's a, oh,

174
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:54,560
it's a good idea. It'd be like that game with the Tokyo Jungle where, like, the

175
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:57,680
dog you play is like the different animals. Did I ever tell you guys what

176
00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:01,240
happened to me with the postal and he snaps with the costume people in Times

177
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:05,800
Square when, when we were filming that video with Alex and Joe? Would they got

178
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:10,180
mad at you or something. They captured me yeah. I was that video. I was

179
00:11:10,180 --> 00:11:12,900
wandering around New York yeah and we were in Times Square and we didn't use

180
00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:16,380
it because I guess there wasn't good footage of it, but I was like going up

181
00:11:16,380 --> 00:11:20,100
to the I was going up to the costume people and being like who are you? What

182
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:25,500
are you supposed to be and then they all immediately I did it. I said it to one

183
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:28,860
person. They all like got wind that I was talking to one of them and they all

184
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:32,740
encircled me literally like actually surrounded me. We're coming over like

185
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:36,180
picture picture picture, and then I was like I was trying to like get through,

186
00:11:36,180 --> 00:11:39,180
and I like I saw they had that you know they have the big transformers yeah.

187
00:11:39,180 --> 00:11:44,060
There was like a giant bumblebee guy and I was I was like walking towards him

188
00:11:44,060 --> 00:11:47,860
and being like who are you and then he like went to like to like hug me like

189
00:11:47,860 --> 00:11:51,480
he put his arms around and he like he like really lightly touched me, but it

190
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:55,780
like bump me forward and I like smacked my against his cost in the bumblebee

191
00:11:55,780 --> 00:11:59,700
and I smacked my head against the bumblebees like torso and I went out and

192
00:11:59,740 --> 00:12:03,100
man, all of the costume people and she was scattered.

193
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:08,180
Dude, they're so afraid of hurting somebody. They get sued a bunch, I've

194
00:12:08,180 --> 00:12:12,300
heard. There's no way people are suing them. Don't they get sued? There's

195
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:16,100
always picture, there's like pictures I've seen of like Elmo getting arrested.

196
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:18,340
But that's not for being... I don't think it's... You don't get arrested

197
00:12:18,340 --> 00:12:22,180
when you get sued. Yeah. He maybe got mad. Yeah, you do.

198
00:12:22,180 --> 00:12:25,480
Don't, don't, don't. He maybe got mad at somebody. Come on. He maybe got

199
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:28,100
mad at somebody, tried to hit him or something. 'Cause that's how much else

200
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:30,940
He was arrested for allegedly groping a 14 year old.

201
00:12:30,940 --> 00:12:31,940
Oh, okay.

202
00:12:31,940 --> 00:12:35,020
Look at that fucking picture though!

203
00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:36,500
Go back to the last one.

204
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:40,340
Yeah, that's a pretty poor, that's a piss poor Elmo costume.

205
00:12:40,340 --> 00:12:45,180
I'm going to be completely honest with you.

206
00:12:45,180 --> 00:12:48,660
His eyes are in two different directions and this lady doesn't even know that she's one

207
00:12:48,660 --> 00:12:50,340
of the most famous women in the world right now.

208
00:12:50,340 --> 00:12:56,140
This lady doesn't want to, doesn't want to look at him.

209
00:12:56,140 --> 00:12:57,140
We could do that.

210
00:12:57,140 --> 00:13:01,020
I think we I mean we always could use some extra money. I don't know you guys. I

211
00:13:01,020 --> 00:13:04,860
could so what if we went what if we went and we dressed up as something easy like

212
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:10,580
characters from the office or yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah, we're famous enough. We

213
00:13:10,580 --> 00:13:14,540
could just go as ourselves. That's real shit yeah, I just feel like I didn't

214
00:13:14,540 --> 00:13:18,100
picture with us. I forgot how famous we are. Yeah, that were perfectly famous

215
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:22,140
to be amazing. Do you want a picture of yeah picture with on a picture with me?

216
00:13:22,140 --> 00:13:26,020
Yeah, but we address as each other. I'm with the other two. You had to dress it

217
00:13:26,060 --> 00:13:31,320
around here somewhere. That'd be the good trick. I don't want to dress up as you. Why?

218
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:35,560
Me neither. Gotta wear a funny hat. I don't want to dress up as either of you. I dress

219
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:39,420
modestly. I don't want to dress up as either of you. Really? I dress modest. Really slut?

220
00:13:39,420 --> 00:13:43,020
Your clothes would be too small on me. I don't dress like a slut whatsoever. You do dress

221
00:13:43,020 --> 00:13:47,400
like a slut. My clothes would be too small. I wear a large shirt. You're wearing a slut's

222
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:52,140
outfit. It's too small for me. I'm fully cut. You can't even see my wrists. You look a smalza

223
00:13:52,140 --> 00:14:01,900
I'm a normal sized guy. I do think I'm shrinking. You're shrinking. It's just the chair, man.

224
00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:06,560
I used to play, when I used to play basketball, I could grab the rim. Right. I was heavier

225
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:11,860
than I was then. I was heavier than I am now. Yeah. It was a little tight. Yeah. No, it

226
00:14:11,860 --> 00:14:16,340
was in my front yard. Yeah. It was on your door. Yeah. I used to be able to palm the

227
00:14:16,340 --> 00:14:21,940
ball too. Golf ball. You know what it is, is you're playing on real streetball courts

228
00:14:21,940 --> 00:14:27,500
now. That's right. I hate street busy. These people are cooking me on the street ball court.

229
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:31,820
Actually no, I played basketball the other day and I was frying. You were playing against

230
00:14:31,820 --> 00:14:35,500
Noah that's a different thing. No, I beat Noah really easily. But me and Sam went over

231
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:39,500
to a court in Williamsburg and I played against these. Where did you go? Reggaeton? I don't

232
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:46,140
know what the hell you're talking about. North Rodney Park. There's no skating at this park.

233
00:14:46,140 --> 00:14:51,820
like two little ledges at this one basketball court, but it's off of Metropolitan. Yeah,

234
00:14:51,820 --> 00:14:52,820
it's like near rocker.

235
00:14:52,820 --> 00:14:58,380
Rola near rocker. Oh, okay. All right. Never mind. I think of a different place. Anyway,

236
00:14:58,380 --> 00:15:04,860
I am glad we got that reggaeton chopped out. Yeah, I was it was amazing. It was my first

237
00:15:04,860 --> 00:15:08,900
time playing basketball in like years and I just so happened to play against like four

238
00:15:08,900 --> 00:15:13,700
like five foot Dominican guys. Yeah, it's always just blocking the shit out of them.

239
00:15:13,700 --> 00:15:16,780
And I was talking shit too. I get mean when I play basketball.

240
00:15:16,780 --> 00:15:18,580
You get mean when you play any game.

241
00:15:18,580 --> 00:15:19,580
That's not true.

242
00:15:19,580 --> 00:15:20,580
Yeah, it is true.

243
00:15:20,580 --> 00:15:22,140
What game have you played with me that I get mean about?

244
00:15:22,140 --> 00:15:24,860
I don't play with you anymore because of that.

245
00:15:24,860 --> 00:15:25,860
What game do I make you...

246
00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:29,140
Warzone during COVID. You would tell me how bad I suck.

247
00:15:29,140 --> 00:15:30,140
Because you suck.

248
00:15:30,140 --> 00:15:31,140
Yeah, I know.

249
00:15:31,140 --> 00:15:36,700
You play on like a funny mouse pad that's this big with the highest sensitivity ever

250
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:39,180
and you just walk around, you look at the ground.

251
00:15:39,180 --> 00:15:40,660
That's how you play shooters.

252
00:15:40,660 --> 00:15:44,020
I like to take in my environment.

253
00:15:44,020 --> 00:15:45,520
Do you think you're competitive?

254
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:46,520
No.

255
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:47,520
Are you competitive with skating?

256
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:48,520
No, not at all.

257
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:49,520
Yeah, how could you?

258
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:50,520
That's why I do it.

259
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:52,260
Because it's the least competitive thing to do.

260
00:15:52,260 --> 00:15:53,780
Because it's not one versus one.

261
00:15:53,780 --> 00:15:54,780
Well, unless you play skate.

262
00:15:54,780 --> 00:15:55,780
It's one versus myself.

263
00:15:55,780 --> 00:15:56,980
Unless you play skate.

264
00:15:56,980 --> 00:15:58,380
It's man versus machine.

265
00:15:58,380 --> 00:15:59,380
Man versus environment.

266
00:15:59,380 --> 00:16:00,380
Oh yeah, MVE.

267
00:16:00,380 --> 00:16:05,140
But I was asking about reggaeton because that's where I got my two clips in Blaine's video.

268
00:16:05,140 --> 00:16:06,140
That's huge.

269
00:16:06,140 --> 00:16:07,860
Those clips, man, those are just so fire.

270
00:16:07,860 --> 00:16:09,660
Yeah, and they're at the park that Caleb was at.

271
00:16:09,660 --> 00:16:10,980
He had a one second grind.

272
00:16:10,980 --> 00:16:13,020
I almost can't believe that you guys were in the same place.

273
00:16:13,020 --> 00:16:14,020
That trick is actually hard.

274
00:16:14,020 --> 00:16:15,020
That's a front crook.

275
00:16:15,020 --> 00:16:17,180
That's a front crook on a ledge that you had to pop out of.

276
00:16:17,180 --> 00:16:18,180
I think he jumped.

277
00:16:18,180 --> 00:16:19,180
Yeah, there was a crook in that video.

278
00:16:19,180 --> 00:16:20,180
Yeah, yeah.

279
00:16:20,180 --> 00:16:21,180
Somebody breaking the law.

280
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:22,180
Breaking the law.

281
00:16:22,180 --> 00:16:23,180
Breaking the law.

282
00:16:23,180 --> 00:16:24,180
Back crook.

283
00:16:24,180 --> 00:16:25,180
Back crook.

284
00:16:25,180 --> 00:16:28,260
If I was a mayor of New York, I would literally, I wouldn't even be arresting skaters.

285
00:16:28,260 --> 00:16:29,260
He did.

286
00:16:29,260 --> 00:16:30,260
There's a video of him at Borough Hall.

287
00:16:30,260 --> 00:16:32,260
I would be distributing drugs to skaters.

288
00:16:32,260 --> 00:16:33,260
As if they can't get it themselves.

289
00:16:33,260 --> 00:16:35,220
But I would be flooding the streets.

290
00:16:35,220 --> 00:16:40,380
Every skater, I would have Badger from Breaking Bad sitting in every skate park handing out

291
00:16:40,380 --> 00:16:41,380
dime bags of whatever.

292
00:16:41,380 --> 00:16:45,660
I would be distributing free boards and yeah, they're landmines and the wheels are black

293
00:16:45,660 --> 00:16:46,660
bombs with fuses.

294
00:16:46,660 --> 00:16:54,100
But there's a video of Eric Adams.

295
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:59,300
It's like the day after he just got the Brooklyn Banks back and it's a video of him just like

296
00:16:59,300 --> 00:17:02,540
telling people to stop skating at Borough Hall.

297
00:17:02,540 --> 00:17:04,740
And people were, "How dare he?"

298
00:17:04,740 --> 00:17:09,300
what the fuck is wrong with this guy? He is doing too much. See, but the day that he

299
00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:14,580
goes up like Obama announcing Osama's death and says, 'Every skater has been

300
00:17:14,580 --> 00:17:21,300
killed in the, in the entire city, we kill every skater.' Or, 'We got Tony Hawk.'

301
00:17:21,300 --> 00:17:28,020
Just for no reason, Tony Hawk lives in another state. Yeah. We got him. Don't

302
00:17:28,020 --> 00:17:32,420
even try. This is, this is a message to you skaters. Tony Hawk is sitting in a

303
00:17:32,420 --> 00:17:37,580
cell somewhere and we put the guy from the green mile in there. Michael Clark

304
00:17:37,580 --> 00:17:42,000
Duncan, yeah, but this time he does not have powers. He's and he's angry. We put

305
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:46,560
his body in there, it's taking up the entire cell and they would go rose.

306
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:50,120
Well, I'm going to stop skating. Then the skaters, the graffiti artists, the

307
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:55,860
people who the music listener louders in the buildings, the people who yes, yes,

308
00:17:55,860 --> 00:18:00,180
by the way, music listener louders and I have some amazing news. Yeah, my

309
00:18:00,220 --> 00:18:01,220
Somebody's here for you.

310
00:18:01,220 --> 00:18:02,220
For me?

311
00:18:02,220 --> 00:18:03,220
Yeah.

312
00:18:03,220 --> 00:18:04,220
Yeah, it's for you, Caleb.

313
00:18:04,220 --> 00:18:05,220
Okay, I'll go get that.

314
00:18:05,220 --> 00:18:06,220
And then I have amazing news, but continue.

315
00:18:06,220 --> 00:18:07,220
What is this, mail?

316
00:18:07,220 --> 00:18:08,220
Yeah, that's a mail.

317
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:09,220
What is he saying?

318
00:18:09,220 --> 00:18:10,220
His shirt says Nalc.

319
00:18:10,220 --> 00:18:11,220
Is he a Nalc Boys fan?

320
00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:12,220
Is that a Nalc Boys shirt?

321
00:18:12,220 --> 00:18:13,220
I wonder what this is.

322
00:18:13,220 --> 00:18:14,220
I wonder.

323
00:18:14,220 --> 00:18:15,220
I think it's just a letter for either us or the people who live in the store.

324
00:18:15,220 --> 00:18:16,220
It's a letter?

325
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:17,220
Maybe it's an eviction notice.

326
00:18:17,220 --> 00:18:18,220
Yeah, it's probably an eviction notice.

327
00:18:18,220 --> 00:18:19,220
It could be funny.

328
00:18:19,220 --> 00:18:20,220
It would be funny if it was an eviction notice.

329
00:18:20,220 --> 00:18:21,220
Yeah, that's probably how we would find out is through the mail.

330
00:18:21,220 --> 00:18:22,220
Yeah.

331
00:18:22,220 --> 00:18:23,220
We would find out through the mail.

332
00:18:23,220 --> 00:18:26,260
funny if it was an eviction notice. Yeah, that's probably how we would find out is through

333
00:18:26,260 --> 00:18:30,660
the mail. Yeah, we would find out through the mail. What are you talking about? We would

334
00:18:30,660 --> 00:18:35,500
our landlord would call. What are you doing? Do you know what that letter is? Probably

335
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:40,260
like an electric bill or something. Probably an eviction notice. Why would it be? Is it

336
00:18:40,260 --> 00:18:48,580
an eviction notice? Caleb? No letter. It's for me. Letter for you. For you. A secret

337
00:18:48,580 --> 00:18:52,420
secret admirer. That's not it is that was your secret admirer. I'll get it.

338
00:18:52,420 --> 00:18:54,920
I'll read it to you right now. If you don't believe me, all right, go get it.

339
00:18:54,920 --> 00:19:00,520
He got some water with him to bro. He got two different cups. He's got two. He's

340
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:05,460
using four cups. Look at for one drink of water, four cups. He's using four

341
00:19:05,460 --> 00:19:09,820
fucking cups for one drink of one drink of water for putting his lips onto all

342
00:19:09,820 --> 00:19:13,620
four. It is incredible how wasteful he is. Okay,

343
00:19:13,620 --> 00:19:16,060
my letter from the secret admirer.

344
00:19:17,540 --> 00:19:22,540
it's the con intervention. No, it's not.

345
00:19:22,540 --> 00:19:27,840
Dearest Caleb,

346
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:30,240
your bill breakdown.

347
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:34,240
Dearest, dearest Caleb, your bill breakdown.

348
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:37,040
There is a turnoff notice on this bill.

349
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:40,620
Set up a payment agreement to pay your past due balance to

350
00:19:40,620 --> 00:19:43,120
ensure your service is not turned off. Your down payment

351
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:47,220
can be as low as 15% and your balance can be paid off over 12

352
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:50,080
months. You know it's a turn off talking about these damn down payments.

353
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:53,560
Motherfucker. How's that? A letter from a secret admirer. You don't know what

354
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:56,440
you're talking about. Yeah, but they were saying they're telling you what

355
00:19:56,440 --> 00:20:00,960
to do to not turn them off. Oh, true. So they were like, you need to pay up

356
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:05,360
and you need to pay me money. And you also need to start dressing less like

357
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:09,760
a slut. I need a sugar baby. I think you need a sugar baby. I have a wife.

358
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:14,080
I have to spoil your wife. You know what? A real sugar baby is a lot of

359
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:19,040
all these people. It's an animal. It's a baby. It's a food. Get a baby. You

360
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:25,180
cannot have a kid yet. Why? Because I would feed it booze. I would you would

361
00:20:25,180 --> 00:20:25,440
be

362
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:30,260
you will not be you were going to try to be uncle Patrick. You will not be

363
00:20:30,260 --> 00:20:35,440
uncle Pat. I honestly not to your day. I don't want you to take this the way

364
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:39,020
that it sounds, but you're dangerous to have around a child. I'm not dangerous

365
00:20:39,020 --> 00:20:42,680
to have around a child. I have you are not in not in the way that you will hurt

366
00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:46,380
them. I don't think I have no I do think that you will ruin them. Yeah, I think

367
00:20:46,380 --> 00:20:49,800
that if I left my kid with you for a weekend, it would be I'd need a new

368
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:52,520
I may have talked about this before, but

369
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:58,640
my nephew did flip off his mom. Yeah, well, there it is, and it was a fight

370
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:01,780
between her and her baby daddy and

371
00:21:01,780 --> 00:21:07,180
little did they know they know they deduced it pretty quick that I was the

372
00:21:07,180 --> 00:21:12,340
one that taught him how to flip off. You taught him that because I've been

373
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:17,800
flipping them off since he was a baby. Kids know so much more than I did when I was a kid.

374
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:20,320
My little brother, there's a video of him when he was six years old. When I was six

375
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:23,040
years old, I didn't know how to cuss. There's a video of him.

376
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:24,700
Well, who was he around?

377
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:29,000
He was around me and my brother, and we were in the car, and my brother took a video of

378
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:34,360
him, and he looks in the camera and he says, "Fuck, fuck, fuck, bullshit, asshole."

379
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:37,640
What? How do you learn that at six years old?

380
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:41,240
I don't think I cussed around my parents until I was probably 22.

381
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:45,480
I'm here. Yeah, I didn't cuss until I was eighteen. I remember really my my mom

382
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:49,200
used to all the time. My mom and my stepdad, they used to do this move. My

383
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:52,880
dad, I don't I haven't heard him say anything above the B word. He's kind of

384
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:56,960
sticking in the PG range, but my mom and my stepdad when I was growing up, they

385
00:21:56,960 --> 00:22:01,280
would say like instead of saying like fuck that, they'd be like that. Oh, they

386
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:06,120
just mouth it. I'm almost a sugar. Oh sugar. How's that a cuss? That's the

387
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:08,800
opposite of one saying that's and that's like a blessing. It's the complete

388
00:22:08,820 --> 00:22:16,360
opposite of poop sugar yeah P. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, P is not the

389
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:20,280
opposite of poop. P and poop are synonymous or in the same family tree.

390
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:23,300
Here's what I was talking to my wife about last night. This is the kind of

391
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:28,220
conversations we have. Is a vagina the opposite of a penis? Oh, here's a

392
00:22:28,220 --> 00:22:31,860
conversation I was having. No, they're in the same tree. Well, she said they

393
00:22:31,860 --> 00:22:34,380
were like brother and sister, and I said,

394
00:22:35,460 --> 00:22:38,700
I said no brother and sister you they shouldn't be having. They shouldn't be

395
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:42,560
having sex with each other. They should at least be fifth cousins. Here's what I

396
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:45,840
said. I said I what here's the conversation conversation that we were

397
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:48,300
having last night. I was asking if I

398
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:55,140
became paralyzed and I into the position where I was on all my all force hands and

399
00:22:55,140 --> 00:22:59,340
knees. Would you take care of me for the rest of my life to a dog's position?

400
00:22:59,340 --> 00:23:04,020
Yeah, I've told her so I've told my wife so many times if I'm paralyzed, she said

401
00:23:04,060 --> 00:23:09,260
yes. She said yes, that's good. I've told my wife so many times if I lose an eye,

402
00:23:09,260 --> 00:23:15,260
if I lose a toe, you're a you can leave you can at least cheat on me.

403
00:23:15,260 --> 00:23:17,560
She lose it

404
00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:22,060
your pinky toe yeah, you just hard for you to balance a little bit. You just

405
00:23:22,060 --> 00:23:25,900
have to work in she's like move you come home. No, I'm trying to her with

406
00:23:25,900 --> 00:23:28,780
if I lose all my train run on her

407
00:23:30,140 --> 00:23:34,080
all these guys lined up out the door. Yeah, if I lose all my limbs and all my

408
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:35,100
senses and I'm

409
00:23:35,100 --> 00:23:39,740
I'm literally a hair. Yeah, I exist as a hair, a piece of hair with a brain

410
00:23:39,740 --> 00:23:44,440
stuck to it. She better stick with me and if I get long COVID or something and

411
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:47,820
I'm stuck in the hospital and I have the tubes in my mouth, I don't want the

412
00:23:47,820 --> 00:23:52,900
photo of her holding my hand. I want to disappear. Yeah, I want no photos of

413
00:23:52,900 --> 00:23:58,100
being in the hospital. Yes, I want to be gone. So yeah, I do not want any

414
00:23:58,140 --> 00:24:01,580
photos like that, especially not because the thing is it's going to she's at a

415
00:24:01,580 --> 00:24:05,940
blink on a concert next. Yeah, exactly. That's what I want. Exactly. I want.

416
00:24:05,940 --> 00:24:08,780
She's gonna. Tom and Mark on stage. She

417
00:24:08,780 --> 00:24:11,860
is playing the drums.

418
00:24:11,860 --> 00:24:14,420
Jonah tits at Adam song.

419
00:24:14,420 --> 00:24:21,980
No, I but I don't want to haunt the next the next husband. I do because I know

420
00:24:21,980 --> 00:24:25,820
that I will die young. Yeah, this is I've known this my whole life. This is why I

421
00:24:25,820 --> 00:24:30,960
I live so dangerously me too, but so I know that I'm not going to be here only

422
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:34,200
one, so I don't want to ruin it. You know

423
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:39,120
this isn't fully married man. What I'm not going to be the only one

424
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:44,680
I'm going to die one day and she's going to want to date some old guy. Even

425
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:48,020
if I even if I die, I want to be kept in a Tupperware in the fridge.

426
00:24:48,020 --> 00:24:54,720
I want the I want to has been to open up the fridge, eat a slice of cold pizza on

427
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:56,360
Sunday morning and eat your nose.

428
00:24:56,360 --> 00:25:00,860
It's a piece of

429
00:25:00,860 --> 00:25:05,800
looking right at you to look at every single day. I want to be there. I don't

430
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:10,540
want to be there. I don't want to be there. I'll be there whether or not she

431
00:25:10,540 --> 00:25:11,120
knows it.

432
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:16,240
If I'm going to be a ghost, you're going to haunt her. There's going to be like a

433
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:20,240
piece of like maybe my arm is going to be hidden in the apartment, but I'll be

434
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:25,920
on maybe my leg arm is hidden. My arm is I cut off my arm before I left, so

435
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:29,400
there leaves a pay a bread crumb leaves a bread crumb trail. We're not talking

436
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:32,940
about just leaving. No, I'm going to just leave. I think I think the best

437
00:25:32,940 --> 00:25:37,520
argument against ghost existing yeah is that because if you were a ghost,

438
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:41,520
wouldn't you try all the time to just like watch TV or something to pass the

439
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:45,600
time? Yeah, unless I'll try to go in the TV. Here's what I think. Maybe ghost

440
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:49,360
can be real, but there is something so incredible in the ghost world that we

441
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:54,100
I can't even imagine that is so great that you get like you before you die

442
00:25:54,100 --> 00:25:57,780
you're like okay. I'm going to I'm going to prove that that ghost exists. I'm

443
00:25:57,780 --> 00:25:59,900
going to come back as a ghost. I'm going to haunt my family members. I'm going

444
00:25:59,900 --> 00:26:02,380
to show them that I'm still alive and then you get there and they have some

445
00:26:02,380 --> 00:26:05,580
new type of TV or something where you're it's so good that you don't even use

446
00:26:05,580 --> 00:26:09,040
like I don't even need to contact the world living. I don't even want to turn

447
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:12,640
on or off any lights. I don't want to moan and drag chains. Yeah, I literally

448
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:16,060
I want to play this new ghost video game that they only have here for the rest of

449
00:26:16,060 --> 00:26:19,380
eternity. Maybe they have some like contract that says that like if you

450
00:26:19,380 --> 00:26:23,700
you right or a contract. If you try to contact the outside world, you are not

451
00:26:23,700 --> 00:26:27,180
going to be able to play this ghost video game that we invented and check it out.

452
00:26:27,180 --> 00:26:29,780
You get a limited point. And my kind of imagination, the good-, you don't even

453
00:26:29,780 --> 00:26:33,060
need a contract, the game is just so incredible that it's all you want to do

454
00:26:33,060 --> 00:26:36,780
forever. The afterlife. I thought it was like an ultimatum in my head. No, 'cause

455
00:26:36,780 --> 00:26:40,380
I kind of have a positive, optimistic imagination. The afterlife is almost

456
00:26:40,380 --> 00:26:45,740
certainly a dimensional shift, where you start off, you're in the first dimension,

457
00:26:45,900 --> 00:26:49,960
second. We've both we've all been first and second. Now we're the third. The next

458
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:53,000
one is going to be the one where we're at first and second. We were we were

459
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:56,500
drawing this. We were drawing and then we were sperm. No, you can't even see

460
00:26:56,500 --> 00:27:00,200
these dimensions, but we are in we were so these aren't the shapes dimensions.

461
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:02,340
These are just different types of dimensions, different types of

462
00:27:02,340 --> 00:27:05,740
dimensions. And now the fourth one, the fourth one, we're going to be in. We're

463
00:27:05,740 --> 00:27:08,600
in the third one right now. I thought we were in the fourth one. We're going to

464
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:12,500
be in the fifth one. No, no, no, no. The fourth one is is time. That's the fourth

465
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:15,980
dimension. What's the fifth dimension? They don't even know. Fifth dimension is

466
00:27:15,980 --> 00:27:19,900
Ascension though. Ascension. No, see that's what I'm saying. I think you go ten and then

467
00:27:19,900 --> 00:27:23,140
you prestige back to one like Call of Duty. I was back on those Facebook groups.

468
00:27:23,140 --> 00:27:28,060
Yeah. Ascension, fifth dimension. Ascension Facebook groups and there's this lady. Who's that

469
00:27:28,060 --> 00:27:34,140
dude? Oh the guy we used to love. Yeah. Desmaine Blu-Ray. Desmaine Blu-Ray. But there's

470
00:27:34,140 --> 00:27:38,760
this lady who she she posts in this group all the time and it's actually

471
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:39,880
she really said, but

472
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:46,720
continue she it's also really funny. She like she has a basically. I think she

473
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:49,800
she has like her eight year old son. She always post her a picture like a

474
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:53,940
picture video of her eight year old son and like with a caption like OMG, my

475
00:27:53,940 --> 00:27:58,640
eight year old son, just like just explain to me what God is and he just

476
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:01,640
told me how we're going to travel to the next dimension and it's always like

477
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:04,960
this really long thing and she posted one. I was like my eight year old son

478
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:09,120
has evolved past the need for food. I know I have to feed him, but he says

479
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:12,840
that he doesn't want food anymore because he's transitioning to become an

480
00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:13,240
age

481
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:16,040
stuff like

482
00:28:16,040 --> 00:28:20,800
Jesus so crazy and the and that she like I was at first. I thought she was

483
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:23,720
just crazy and she's just posting pictures of her son and then she post

484
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:28,560
videos where his son is like mom. God is that is energy mom. Don't you

485
00:28:28,560 --> 00:28:32,920
understand and it's fully the kid who's like doing it to her yeah? Well, he's

486
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:36,400
he's going to be like he's a actual X files kid. That's going to be coached

487
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:41,660
saying it. There's no way he could be a star seed. He said that's true. What

488
00:28:41,660 --> 00:28:43,360
did he say a sacred star child?

489
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:48,120
He said he was doing some crazy thing where he was making the word energy

490
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:51,500
turn into the word God or something whoa and he was like going through this

491
00:28:51,500 --> 00:28:56,440
whole God's name is region. He was like oh no, you know he was saying he was

492
00:28:56,480 --> 00:29:03,280
I was he was going like mom, mom, energy, enter, G, enter, God,

493
00:29:03,280 --> 00:29:11,280
energy, inner God, what is sad or your energy? Yeah, enter, G, energy, yeah,

494
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:16,720
that's your energy. That's what I would be a thug child. Yeah, sacred,

495
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:20,920
child, sacred, thug, child, sacred thug is a sick name

496
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:26,460
for a guy to have sacred thug or like an album. I guys name an album cover

497
00:29:26,460 --> 00:29:32,060
album name sacred thug okay sacred thug by Patrick yeah.

498
00:29:32,060 --> 00:29:38,260
Imagine that album cover i'm like an angel and i'm wearing like my fooboo and

499
00:29:38,260 --> 00:29:47,100
my echo shorts fab four angels by fab back yeah. Oh my God, a bad for angels

500
00:29:47,100 --> 00:29:52,300
by a you got a fat echo location, you're wearing your you're a bat, you're

501
00:29:52,340 --> 00:29:56,640
wearing your F F P B C for Patrick by Cameron

502
00:29:56,640 --> 00:30:03,420
one of the two yeah, but this one is and it's that's right. You should just make

503
00:30:03,420 --> 00:30:04,320
that shirt for yeah.

504
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:09,940
There's a white t shirt with with some sharpie on it. Yeah, P B C and it's got

505
00:30:09,940 --> 00:30:14,360
like it's got like old English that is metallic, but also glittering and it's

506
00:30:14,360 --> 00:30:17,920
a sacred fight. Honestly guys, if I knew how to make a shirt, I'd do that, but it

507
00:30:17,940 --> 00:30:22,580
seems way too complicated. Yeah, shirt making is complicated. I am done doing merch. We don't

508
00:30:22,580 --> 00:30:28,820
need to do any more merch. What we need to do is a full fashion brand. Yeah. And we need

509
00:30:28,820 --> 00:30:33,420
to have a fashion show. That's a good idea. Okay. I have a ton of ideas for clothes. Well,

510
00:30:33,420 --> 00:30:38,020
Noah has a screen printing at the apartment. Pants made of shirts, this kind of thing.

511
00:30:38,020 --> 00:30:41,780
Shoes made of hats. Noah, we can do all this stuff at my apartment. Noah has all this. I

512
00:30:41,780 --> 00:30:47,500
had an idea for clothes a week or two ago. What was it? Fishnet basketball shorts. Oh,

513
00:30:47,500 --> 00:30:51,800
Oh damn, that's good right that that's high fashion. That is that would that

514
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:56,140
would literally go crazy. Wouldn't it go crazy on mulberry street, bro and also

515
00:30:56,140 --> 00:30:58,200
is that is that in a fairy tale world?

516
00:30:58,200 --> 00:31:02,940
Why don't also go crazy on mulberry street in the fairytale world? Isn't

517
00:31:02,940 --> 00:31:07,840
that where the that's where shrek lived? Yeah, why don't more guys wear fish net

518
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:12,860
guys see through stuff with you? You can see your dick guys do that who go to

519
00:31:12,860 --> 00:31:16,940
which guys bushwick dude. There's fucking guys guys. I've never seen guys

520
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:21,360
with fish nets. You've never seen guys with fish nets on their cock. I'm

521
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:25,340
saying like it. So for this, that would be really embarrassing for that guy to

522
00:31:25,340 --> 00:31:30,720
dunk on you. Yeah, it's like his nuts are actually worse. You smell his nuts.

523
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:32,060
But normally it smells on a good

524
00:31:32,060 --> 00:31:37,160
that's a good actually. That's a really good question. When Patrick Ewing got

525
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:38,000
dunked on by

526
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:42,640
I was so nervous I was going to get questioned about the smell of my penis.

527
00:31:42,660 --> 00:31:47,940
When Patrick Ewing got dunked on by Scotty Pippen and he walks over his face, it's a big,

528
00:31:47,940 --> 00:31:49,860
they call it a facial in the NBA.

529
00:31:49,860 --> 00:31:51,500
That's what they call it when you get dunked on like that.

530
00:31:51,500 --> 00:31:52,500
Yeah.

531
00:31:52,500 --> 00:31:53,500
Does he smell his nuts?

532
00:31:53,500 --> 00:31:54,500
Yeah.

533
00:31:54,500 --> 00:31:55,500
He has to.

534
00:31:55,500 --> 00:31:56,500
For sure.

535
00:31:56,500 --> 00:31:57,500
There's no way he don't.

536
00:31:57,500 --> 00:31:58,500
The guy's been running around for an hour and a half.

537
00:31:58,500 --> 00:31:59,860
Have you ever smelled basketball shorts that got sweat in them?

538
00:31:59,860 --> 00:32:00,860
Have you guys smelled other guys' nuts?

539
00:32:00,860 --> 00:32:01,860
Yes.

540
00:32:01,860 --> 00:32:02,860
Of course I do.

541
00:32:02,860 --> 00:32:03,860
I've smelled them.

542
00:32:03,860 --> 00:32:04,860
We've talked about that before.

543
00:32:04,860 --> 00:32:05,860
Smelled another man's nuts?

544
00:32:05,860 --> 00:32:06,860
We actually already had a long discussion about that.

545
00:32:06,860 --> 00:32:07,860
We were in a van.

546
00:32:07,860 --> 00:32:11,020
We were in a van together for a whole month.

547
00:32:11,020 --> 00:32:12,500
We all smelled each other's nuts.

548
00:32:12,500 --> 00:32:15,960
but that was like but like smelling that's like that's one thing that came

549
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:19,600
to get on smell. Yeah, I mean like singular someone's not person's nuts,

550
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:24,740
because I know exactly on my nut smell. I know I'm on smell. I can smell them. I

551
00:32:24,740 --> 00:32:27,700
could smell them on the street. You know when you like like a pie on a window,

552
00:32:27,700 --> 00:32:29,080
don't you like leave butter out?

553
00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:30,980
No, no,

554
00:32:30,980 --> 00:32:35,700
I don't think butter smells. I think that's the thing when it goes bad.

555
00:32:35,700 --> 00:32:39,400
You've said, do you know when you leave food item out and we both said no, you

556
00:32:39,420 --> 00:32:40,920
You just leave food out a lot, don't you?

557
00:32:40,920 --> 00:32:41,920
No.

558
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:42,920
You do.

559
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:43,920
Yeah, I do.

560
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:47,240
You know when you leave pork out, that's what my nuts smell like, pork fat.

561
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:48,240
Pork fat doesn't smell.

562
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:49,240
When you leave pork out?

563
00:32:49,240 --> 00:32:51,700
Pork fat, when you cook it in the air fryer.

564
00:32:51,700 --> 00:32:55,900
I thought that I was making cracklings the other day, because I cut off the piece of

565
00:32:55,900 --> 00:33:02,100
fat on the pork chop that I had, and I realized halfway through, I was like, "Oh, that wasn't

566
00:33:02,100 --> 00:33:03,100
the skin.

567
00:33:03,100 --> 00:33:04,100
That was just the fat."

568
00:33:04,100 --> 00:33:05,100
Just fat.

569
00:33:05,100 --> 00:33:06,100
You just melted fat in the air fryer?

570
00:33:06,100 --> 00:33:07,100
Yeah.

571
00:33:07,100 --> 00:33:08,540
Well, you know, like the really squishy stuff?

572
00:33:08,540 --> 00:33:13,540
I'm over the air fryer. Me too. I'm over it. Me too. I made some chicken tenders in it last

573
00:33:13,540 --> 00:33:16,940
night. I just warm stuff up in there now. It's a microwave. I don't have a microwave,

574
00:33:16,940 --> 00:33:19,980
but I do have an air fryer. It's a microwave. I made last night. It's a better micro... I

575
00:33:19,980 --> 00:33:23,700
have a microwave, but I'd rather warm something up in it. Salmon is the only thing I make

576
00:33:23,700 --> 00:33:27,300
in the air fryer. Salmon and asparagus. Even that though. I haven't had a microwave for

577
00:33:27,300 --> 00:33:32,060
a couple of years. I think that microwaves are probably hurting lots of people. I haven't

578
00:33:32,060 --> 00:33:34,740
had a microwave. Because I've been feeling amazing. I haven't had a microwave since I

579
00:33:34,740 --> 00:33:38,980
as I moved into my new place, I feel incredible all the time. It's the

580
00:33:38,980 --> 00:33:42,820
microwave, man. It's hurting you. It really is. I feel so amazing. People get

581
00:33:42,820 --> 00:33:46,460
microwave radia-, I don't know how it works at all. Me neither. Not two inches

582
00:33:46,460 --> 00:33:52,620
ago. It can't, it can't, the pain of plastic can't, that can't be protecting

583
00:33:52,620 --> 00:33:55,660
you. No. No, you're done. There's no way. Especially if you open the corner.

584
00:33:55,660 --> 00:33:59,780
It's going into the thing you eat. Yeah. No. And the stuff that's in the

585
00:33:59,780 --> 00:34:03,740
microwave is-, it's got plastic on it. Anything that, any kind of device where

586
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:08,220
you put your head into it, it explodes. Yeah, or your dog. Yeah, that's not a

587
00:34:08,220 --> 00:34:12,220
good device to be eating the food from. Yeah. Well, I mean an oven would cook

588
00:34:12,220 --> 00:34:14,740
it, but it wouldn't explode. It would cook your head. It wouldn't explode.

589
00:34:14,740 --> 00:34:17,780
But it wouldn't explode the head. Which a microwave would. Yeah. A microwave

590
00:34:17,780 --> 00:34:21,640
does. Haven't you seen Last House on the left? Yeah, and Kick-Ass. Yeah,

591
00:34:21,640 --> 00:34:24,980
and Kick-House. Dare to be stupid. Dare to be stupid. Has that happened in

592
00:34:24,980 --> 00:34:27,820
Last House on the left? I think the reboot. They blow up the... Oh, I

593
00:34:27,820 --> 00:34:30,100
never saw the reboot. The Urban Legend, they blow up a dog.

594
00:34:31,380 --> 00:34:32,380
What are you talking about?

595
00:34:32,380 --> 00:34:33,380
A movie, Urban Legend.

596
00:34:33,380 --> 00:34:34,380
I never heard of that.

597
00:34:34,380 --> 00:34:35,380
I heard of that.

598
00:34:35,380 --> 00:34:36,380
He knows it.

599
00:34:36,380 --> 00:34:37,380
Is that about like Bigfoot?

600
00:34:37,380 --> 00:34:38,380
It's about...

601
00:34:38,380 --> 00:34:39,380
Car door.

602
00:34:39,380 --> 00:34:42,540
It's a guy who, he's like a serial killer who's based on all...

603
00:34:42,540 --> 00:34:43,980
Man door, hard car door.

604
00:34:43,980 --> 00:34:44,980
Mandalorian.

605
00:34:44,980 --> 00:34:45,980
The Mandalorian's in it.

606
00:34:45,980 --> 00:34:46,980
Oh, really?

607
00:34:46,980 --> 00:34:47,980
Yeah.

608
00:34:47,980 --> 00:34:51,620
It was like one of those, it's like a Scream era ripoff.

609
00:34:51,620 --> 00:34:52,620
It's a really bad ripoff.

610
00:34:52,620 --> 00:34:55,620
It's like I Know What You Did Last Summer type vibe.

611
00:34:55,620 --> 00:34:56,620
Oh, yeah.

612
00:34:56,620 --> 00:35:00,380
Where instead of movies, he's obsessed with urban legends.

613
00:35:00,380 --> 00:35:04,820
So he does like Paul Bunyan, Big, that kind of thing?

614
00:35:04,820 --> 00:35:06,820
No, no, those are folk tales.

615
00:35:06,820 --> 00:35:07,820
Oh, La Cucaracha.

616
00:35:07,820 --> 00:35:08,820
No, that's a cockroach.

617
00:35:08,820 --> 00:35:09,820
No, that's a cockroach.

618
00:35:09,820 --> 00:35:10,820
La Chupacabra.

619
00:35:10,820 --> 00:35:11,820
Chihuahua.

620
00:35:11,820 --> 00:35:15,660
The lady who tries to dry off her dog in the microwave.

621
00:35:15,660 --> 00:35:18,460
Juvio, pull up the picture of the Mexican pet.

622
00:35:18,460 --> 00:35:19,460
What's that?

623
00:35:19,460 --> 00:35:21,180
Just Google Mexican pet.

624
00:35:21,180 --> 00:35:23,180
You've definitely heard this urban legend before.

625
00:35:23,180 --> 00:35:24,460
I've never heard of the Mexican pet.

626
00:35:24,460 --> 00:35:25,740
Wait, what was that last one?

627
00:35:25,740 --> 00:35:27,380
Hold on, type in Mexican again?

628
00:35:27,380 --> 00:35:28,740
No, go to Mexican pet.

629
00:35:28,740 --> 00:35:32,420
I don't care about Google auto complete. Well, the Mexican pet is the urban

630
00:35:32,420 --> 00:35:36,420
anywhere. Wait, wait, wait, somebody somebody on this computer. This is

631
00:35:36,420 --> 00:35:40,140
Caleb's computer. There it is, but second first one on the left. Yeah,

632
00:35:40,140 --> 00:35:40,820
that's the

633
00:35:40,820 --> 00:35:46,940
yes. I looked up big Mexican guys. As I tried to make it the background of the

634
00:35:46,940 --> 00:35:47,540
computer.

635
00:35:47,540 --> 00:35:49,060
Okay,

636
00:35:49,060 --> 00:35:50,660
look, look,

637
00:35:50,660 --> 00:35:52,960
it's in the auto complete

638
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:55,260
big

639
00:35:57,460 --> 00:36:01,460
I was just seeing if it was I was just seeing if it was

640
00:36:01,460 --> 00:36:07,860
the Mexican Pet Urban Legend is the one where a lady goes to buy a dog from

641
00:36:07,860 --> 00:36:10,960
Mexico and they're like yeah, this is a special breed of dog. It's like a

642
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:13,760
chihuahua or whatever and she takes it home and it's acting weirdly and then

643
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:17,160
that she like takes it to the vet and the vet is like lady. This isn't a dog.

644
00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:20,960
This is a rat. Yeah. Oh, well, how you never heard that before? No, but I also

645
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:24,160
that's not that crazy to me. It's pretty well. It's an urban legend. It's not

646
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:29,100
people have rats all the time true. Is this a barb and legend or wiki also

647
00:36:29,100 --> 00:36:32,980
this lady is probably not that smart. I'm speaking of a lady. It's an urban

648
00:36:32,980 --> 00:36:37,820
legend. Well, but I'm just saying she wasn't that smart. I have I heard an

649
00:36:37,820 --> 00:36:40,860
amazing joke the other day from my father in law. Do you guys want to hear

650
00:36:40,860 --> 00:36:44,840
it and this is this is for him are rated. So I was pretty impressed that he did

651
00:36:44,840 --> 00:36:50,380
this okay. All right, a king is in his court and he has three nights and he

652
00:36:50,420 --> 00:36:55,940
tells them by the end of the year, whoever brings me the most ping pong balls gets to

653
00:36:55,940 --> 00:36:57,180
inherit the kingdom.

654
00:36:57,180 --> 00:36:59,580
Where is this kingdom?

655
00:36:59,580 --> 00:37:01,860
China.

656
00:37:01,860 --> 00:37:08,260
So he says as many ping pong balls as you can get, you get to inherit the kingdom.

657
00:37:08,260 --> 00:37:10,680
Eight months later, the first night comes back.

658
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:16,860
He says, "Sir King, I've brought you two million ping pong balls.

659
00:37:16,860 --> 00:37:17,980
It took me the last eight months.

660
00:37:17,980 --> 00:37:19,340
I've been working tirelessly.

661
00:37:19,340 --> 00:37:26,340
million ping pong balls, right? The second night comes two months after that, and he

662
00:37:26,340 --> 00:37:31,300
says, Sir, I have brought you five million ping pong balls. That's three million more

663
00:37:31,300 --> 00:37:35,120
than the last guy. I definitely got this in the back. This was two months later. This

664
00:37:35,120 --> 00:37:38,580
is two months. So did the first guy get to keep working or was he? No, he already turned

665
00:37:38,580 --> 00:37:44,340
in his balls. He was too tired, so he stopped. All right. Yeah. So the so now it's the last

666
00:37:44,340 --> 00:37:50,340
day of the year, December 31st, right? The 11th hour. Okay. The last night comes in, he's

667
00:37:50,340 --> 00:37:56,080
on crutches, a full cast all the way up and down his entire body, right? He has a full

668
00:37:56,080 --> 00:38:03,700
body cast and he limps into the court with a rucksack on his back, right? And the king

669
00:38:03,700 --> 00:38:08,840
says, okay, night, you made it here. Finally, you must have been working even more tirelessly

670
00:38:08,840 --> 00:38:13,140
than the last guys. How many ping pong balls did you bring me and the guy says

671
00:38:13,140 --> 00:38:16,860
oh shit. I thought you said King Kong's balls.

672
00:38:16,860 --> 00:38:24,660
Pretty fire had them on this. Why did the other two guys not wait till the end of

673
00:38:24,660 --> 00:38:28,860
the year to get yeah? Why did they work smarter? Not harder man? Also, I'll just

674
00:38:28,860 --> 00:38:31,560
like rest among the impressive part is two months later. This guy's got more

675
00:38:31,560 --> 00:38:34,960
than double the guy who worked eight months. Yeah, more than yeah, I guess so

676
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:38,280
it's pretty impressive, but also the first guy just go back. Why did he turn

677
00:38:38,300 --> 00:38:43,380
I mean, you know, I mean King Kong is basically a giant monkey. Is this a

678
00:38:43,380 --> 00:38:48,340
joke that your, your father-in-law wants you to do on stage? No, he just was

679
00:38:48,340 --> 00:38:52,380
telling me that and, and his, and here's the rest of the family. Oh, come on,

680
00:38:52,380 --> 00:38:54,800
Dad. Here's me. Oh, my God.

681
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:58,300
My God, that is the funniest shit I've ever heard.

682
00:38:58,300 --> 00:39:04,740
Holy shit. Yeah, that's funny. That's seriously fun, fucking funny. And they

683
00:39:04,760 --> 00:39:09,240
got mad at you for swearing to know. Don't say fun King funny, funny, funny. Don't say

684
00:39:09,240 --> 00:39:12,680
fun King funny in front of my father. I thought it was pretty good. Yeah, yeah, and he said

685
00:39:12,680 --> 00:39:16,920
that he heard that joke. It was the first joke he ever heard the first one ever and

686
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:20,080
I yeah, I didn't even know that King Kong back then. I didn't know if sure, King Kong's

687
00:39:20,080 --> 00:39:24,880
old. Surely I was like balls. Yeah, but you're thinking Donkey Kong. You freaking donkey

688
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:29,640
ass motherfucker. Donkey Kong is barely a monkey to me. Yeah, yeah, I think where's

689
00:39:29,640 --> 00:39:35,080
a tie. Well, he's barely an ape then. Yeah, he wears a tie as a job. What did they ever

690
00:39:35,080 --> 00:39:41,560
explain his name? Donkey Kong? I think it was a translation error. It was supposed to

691
00:39:41,560 --> 00:39:47,480
be Donkey King. Autocorrect fail. Yeah, and he's 42 years old. It is apparently. Luigi

692
00:39:47,480 --> 00:39:53,960
is 22. Donkey Kong needs to start dressing his age. Put some pants on. You're 40 years

693
00:39:53,960 --> 00:39:59,400
old. Come on, you're 40 years old, man. Yeah, you fucking slut ass motherfucker. Okay, so

694
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:03,400
Luigi's 22 and then Donkey Kong Jr. is 41.

695
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:07,400
So it's, I mean, being a year younger than your dad is kind of weird.

696
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:11,400
Oh, here's a question that I had for you guys. I already asked Rex this.

697
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:15,400
Do you guys feel like Jubio is a little bit

698
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:17,400
our version of Yoshi?

699
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:21,400
[laughter]

700
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:22,400
A little bit?

701
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:25,400
Yeah, I think so. I think I could see that.

702
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:29,900
So we like kind of captured him. He's kind of like blood sworn to us.

703
00:40:29,900 --> 00:40:34,000
Uh-huh. Yeah. If we jump on spikes, he dies first and we get another chance.

704
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:38,300
Yeah. And he tried to turn me into an egg. He came from it. He eats every fruit he sees.

705
00:40:38,300 --> 00:40:43,300
He loves eggs. He does love eggs. He actually does love it. Huevos. Yeah. Huevos.

706
00:40:43,300 --> 00:40:47,800
Yeah. That's the one thing I know about him for sure is he that motherfucka loves Huevos.

707
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:52,300
He's green. He's green. Well, he is today. He's green. He is green. He's green.

708
00:40:52,300 --> 00:40:56,000
he won't yeah, he won't put it on. Oh, there is there is he is. He's got a

709
00:40:56,000 --> 00:41:00,500
little bit Yoshi vibes. Yeah, his tongue is as long as it is wide. So

710
00:41:00,500 --> 00:41:05,700
then who is Rex? Is he like Cameron's Waluigi? Rex is not involved in any

711
00:41:05,700 --> 00:41:10,500
sort of Nintendo property. Is Yoshi just a normal Japanese name? Yoshi.

712
00:41:10,500 --> 00:41:13,500
So yeah, there's people named Yoshi. There's a pro skater. So is it?

713
00:41:13,500 --> 00:41:15,100
So Yoshi in

714
00:41:15,100 --> 00:41:20,300
in Japan is just he just has a name. Yeah, it's like Fred or something.

715
00:41:20,300 --> 00:41:23,800
Yeah, that's funny. There's a dude named Yoshi Tenenbaum.

716
00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:27,800
That's cool. Is he Japanese? I guess he's I think he's half Japanese,

717
00:41:27,800 --> 00:41:32,400
half Israeli or something. That's one of the most fire combos you can have in the

718
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:36,600
entire country. That's exactly the name you'd expect. Yeah, Yoshi Tenenbaum. I couldn't come up with that.

719
00:41:36,600 --> 00:41:39,700
I don't remember if he was in the Olympics. He might have been.

720
00:41:39,700 --> 00:41:44,400
Maybe he was skating for Israel in the Olympics. Get skating out of the Olympics.

721
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:48,600
You don't need it. Yeah. Skating and swimming. Trust me. These are not sports.

722
00:41:48,600 --> 00:41:53,400
swimming is for much swimming. Swimming is like the number one in anything else.

723
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:56,580
Yeah, the fucking Olympia. What make it? Why is there no football in the world?

724
00:41:56,580 --> 00:41:59,740
No, it's it's the same as like, why is there no billiards in the Olympics?

725
00:41:59,740 --> 00:42:04,040
That's a good question. It's a, you know, it's basically the same as fucking

726
00:42:04,040 --> 00:42:09,280
running. Swimming is the same as running, but you just added another element to it,

727
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:14,240
which is why people like because the when you boil the Olympics down to its

728
00:42:14,260 --> 00:42:18,960
it's essential is it's just who is the fastest in the world or in every single

729
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:22,860
yeah, but it's probably like the runner guys could probably swim faster than the

730
00:42:22,860 --> 00:42:25,460
swimmers, but they just chose the better sport yeah

731
00:42:25,460 --> 00:42:29,980
and swimming. They have the jump in swimmers have to eat like a billion

732
00:42:29,980 --> 00:42:33,340
pounds a day. That's because they swim all day. That's the thing with a lot of

733
00:42:33,340 --> 00:42:35,060
these sports is like just stop.

734
00:42:35,060 --> 00:42:39,400
You wouldn't have to do any of this shit. If you just knocked it off yeah,

735
00:42:39,400 --> 00:42:43,120
just knock it off. What are you doing? Also you're in a vicious cycle, the

736
00:42:43,120 --> 00:42:43,920
butterfly

737
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:49,480
The butterfly is crazy. That's barely a thing. What is that? That's this one. Where they

738
00:42:49,480 --> 00:42:55,400
jump out of the water and do their arms. Yeah. Oh, that's, that one's sick. No, that one

739
00:42:55,400 --> 00:43:00,400
is goofy. It is goofy AF. It's so hard to do. Every time I do it, I just sit in the

740
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:04,000
middle of the pool. It's like I'm drowning in a cartoon. Yeah. That's my version of the

741
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:09,360
butterfly. Yeah. I can't do the butterfly. No. They should put that in the Olympics.

742
00:43:09,360 --> 00:43:12,840
How about this? I like doing the sea serpent. Here's some, here's some things that you could

743
00:43:12,840 --> 00:43:16,840
put in the Olympics, the Olympic Committee, what philosophy,

744
00:43:16,840 --> 00:43:22,580
velociraptor, philosophy, velociraptor, meme contest, meme contest. Good idea.

745
00:43:22,580 --> 00:43:25,480
I mean, there's it's already subjective. They're already scored off. A

746
00:43:25,480 --> 00:43:29,520
scored off is actually a good idea. Typing, maybe typing, maybe it's a

747
00:43:29,520 --> 00:43:33,880
beacon style. I would actually be interested to see typing, typing typists

748
00:43:33,880 --> 00:43:39,120
in the Olympics or art. Yeah, that's what I mean. You already do gymnastics,

749
00:43:39,160 --> 00:43:43,160
which is God, the artlympics. Well, no, just be part of the no, just be no. We

750
00:43:43,160 --> 00:43:47,080
don't want the legitimacy. We want the nod from the Olympic committee. It's

751
00:43:47,080 --> 00:43:50,360
just in the Olympics. It wouldn't be a whole new. It's a whole different new

752
00:43:50,360 --> 00:43:54,080
time. Back flipping olympics back. They do have back flipping in the as a part

753
00:43:54,080 --> 00:43:57,360
of something else, but I don't care about anything except the back flips

754
00:43:57,360 --> 00:44:01,400
and they do anything besides back flips on that. They just gymnastics flipping,

755
00:44:01,400 --> 00:44:03,920
but they do front flips, which are not that impressive. I could do a front

756
00:44:03,920 --> 00:44:07,880
flip. You couldn't do it now. I know front flip. Turn the camera. Let's let's

757
00:44:07,880 --> 00:44:09,880
Yep, turn the cameras, we'll fucking test it.

758
00:44:09,880 --> 00:44:11,880
I hurt my body.

759
00:44:11,880 --> 00:44:12,880
ACL. No you didn't.

760
00:44:12,880 --> 00:44:13,880
I hurt my body.

761
00:44:13,880 --> 00:44:15,880
He pulled his ACL last night during D&D.

762
00:44:15,880 --> 00:44:16,880
No I didn't.

763
00:44:16,880 --> 00:44:17,880
You did.

764
00:44:17,880 --> 00:44:18,880
No I didn't.

765
00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:19,880
I'm saving you, motherfucker.

766
00:44:19,880 --> 00:44:21,880
I hurt the rest of my body.

767
00:44:21,880 --> 00:44:22,880
No you didn't.

768
00:44:22,880 --> 00:44:23,880
Yeah I did.

769
00:44:23,880 --> 00:44:24,880
I think I could do a front flip.

770
00:44:24,880 --> 00:44:25,880
I think I could do a back flip.

771
00:44:25,880 --> 00:44:28,880
I hurt my back doing that cold open the other day.

772
00:44:28,880 --> 00:44:29,880
Really?

773
00:44:29,880 --> 00:44:31,880
I went home and I was like, "Oh, what the fuck did I do?"

774
00:44:31,880 --> 00:44:32,880
Swinging the sword?

775
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:34,880
What did I do? And remembered that I was like doing jump kicks.

776
00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:35,880
Oh yeah.

777
00:44:35,880 --> 00:44:36,880
I got a bruise on my knee.

778
00:44:36,880 --> 00:44:41,720
arms on my knee. I kind of want to get into some kind of should I do boxing

779
00:44:41,720 --> 00:44:46,420
think boxing and be made for me. No, is that too much? I don't want to yeah.

780
00:44:46,420 --> 00:44:51,240
It's a little too much. It's too much. You would become a monster. I think I

781
00:44:51,240 --> 00:44:55,680
think it's just I just think it's I have a really short arms and I'm small and

782
00:44:55,680 --> 00:44:58,680
I'm way over the weight class that I should be. I think it'd be a perfect

783
00:44:58,680 --> 00:45:01,360
box. I think if you're the type of person who's already working out a bunch

784
00:45:01,360 --> 00:45:04,500
and then you add boxing, I think that's when you cross the line and yes too

785
00:45:04,520 --> 00:45:07,400
much into what I think if you're the type of person who's your workout is

786
00:45:07,400 --> 00:45:12,080
boxing, then you're a girl, then you are a girl. It's true. Girls do boxing.

787
00:45:12,080 --> 00:45:15,240
They do do as and a lot of them will be like yeah, it's good for self defence.

788
00:45:15,240 --> 00:45:18,840
It's like I'll let me see you square up on the subway with the crazy homeless

789
00:45:18,840 --> 00:45:22,320
guy right just straight up like all right, let's box about it. No rules, but

790
00:45:22,320 --> 00:45:26,280
street rules. Yeah, exactly. That's why I do street rules when I books. Yeah,

791
00:45:26,280 --> 00:45:30,760
women need to be what's the kind that you bite, bite, bite, quando. No, no,

792
00:45:30,760 --> 00:45:33,720
there's a kind of martial arts where it's like you bite, you scratch your

793
00:45:33,760 --> 00:45:37,120
guys out. I don't know that doesn't sound like a martial art. It sounds more

794
00:45:37,120 --> 00:45:41,660
just like doing stuff. Well, it may be some there's a name for doing stuff

795
00:45:41,660 --> 00:45:41,920
the

796
00:45:41,920 --> 00:45:45,900
kinamutai that emphasizes biting

797
00:45:45,900 --> 00:45:48,960
biting, pinching,

798
00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:52,360
is what it's called

799
00:45:52,360 --> 00:46:00,400
sick. Oh, my God, wait, I didn't do I'd be the master of this shit. Just

800
00:46:00,440 --> 00:46:04,360
fighting. He just grabbed his nuts. Oh, this is look guys. I wear a helmet. See

801
00:46:04,360 --> 00:46:07,720
okay. This is a real martial art fight in the world. That's what I mean. This

802
00:46:07,720 --> 00:46:12,080
is what martial arts should be look he's well okay, but now he's definitely

803
00:46:12,080 --> 00:46:16,160
going to grab this guy's nuts. Yeah, he punches him and then balls twice and

804
00:46:16,160 --> 00:46:20,020
then it points his finger in his face. Whoa, I got you, you're gay

805
00:46:20,020 --> 00:46:25,240
punches nuts. Two times smell my finger.

806
00:46:25,240 --> 00:46:30,120
That's a good idea. That's I mean that's what martial arts should be. You stick

807
00:46:30,160 --> 00:46:33,160
Stick your finger in your ass, and then you chase him with it.

808
00:46:33,160 --> 00:46:38,160
That's a thing that if you do it in wrestling, it's an immediate disqualification.

809
00:46:38,160 --> 00:46:39,160
Stick your finger in the guy's ass?

810
00:46:39,160 --> 00:46:41,160
It's called checking the oil.

811
00:46:41,160 --> 00:46:42,160
Oh.

812
00:46:42,160 --> 00:46:43,160
Yeah.

813
00:46:43,160 --> 00:46:44,160
Oh, God.

814
00:46:44,160 --> 00:46:46,160
That's kind of an Urban Dictionary meme thing, I think, maybe.

815
00:46:46,160 --> 00:46:47,160
Yeah.

816
00:46:47,160 --> 00:46:48,160
Well, that's a thing that --

817
00:46:48,160 --> 00:46:51,160
There's a sex thing called a Cleveland Steamer, and a chili dog.

818
00:46:51,160 --> 00:46:52,160
That's a real --

819
00:46:52,160 --> 00:46:56,160
That's a thing that when my younger brother did wrestling in middle school,

820
00:46:56,160 --> 00:47:01,160
that they told him it's the most illegal wrestling move.

821
00:47:01,160 --> 00:47:04,120
They told him it was the most--

822
00:47:04,120 --> 00:47:04,960
- I'm sure it is.

823
00:47:04,960 --> 00:47:07,080
- Yeah, you know why it's the most illegal wrestling move?

824
00:47:07,080 --> 00:47:07,920
- Because it's raping.

825
00:47:07,920 --> 00:47:09,600
- Yeah, sexual assault.

826
00:47:09,600 --> 00:47:11,520
(laughing)

827
00:47:11,520 --> 00:47:13,000
- Yeah, that's why.

828
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:13,840
- Yeah.

829
00:47:13,840 --> 00:47:16,240
- I guess that's not a really good thing to tell people

830
00:47:16,240 --> 00:47:19,040
is a good self-defense mechanism.

831
00:47:19,040 --> 00:47:20,680
- You know what they tell you to do though,

832
00:47:20,680 --> 00:47:22,920
when a pit bull has got their teeth,

833
00:47:22,920 --> 00:47:23,760
they like wrapped around a--

834
00:47:23,760 --> 00:47:24,600
- You put it finger in the ass.

835
00:47:24,600 --> 00:47:26,080
- Like a bichon frise, yeah.

836
00:47:26,080 --> 00:47:28,080
you got to check the pit bulls oil.

837
00:47:28,080 --> 00:47:28,580
Yeah.

838
00:47:28,580 --> 00:47:32,580
Which I, trust me, I do not want to, I do not want to check the pit bulls oil.

839
00:47:32,580 --> 00:47:36,080
What you're supposed to do with a pit bull attack series, you're supposed to have a little hammer and you knock out all its teeth.

840
00:47:36,080 --> 00:47:36,580
Yeah.

841
00:47:36,580 --> 00:47:38,580
Yeah, even if it gets you, it's like what?

842
00:47:38,580 --> 00:47:39,080
Yeah.

843
00:47:39,080 --> 00:47:43,580
That's literally, I read that you have to put like some kind of thing in there.

844
00:47:43,580 --> 00:47:45,580
Yeah, a hammer.

845
00:47:45,580 --> 00:47:47,580
*mimics hammer*

846
00:47:47,580 --> 00:47:48,580
*mimics hammer*

847
00:47:48,580 --> 00:47:49,580
Yank it back.

848
00:47:49,580 --> 00:47:54,080
That makes it, I mean, this is pretty much boiling down to hurt the dog at this point.

849
00:47:54,080 --> 00:47:54,580
Yeah.

850
00:47:54,580 --> 00:47:58,680
Yeah, I mean that's the only way you're supposed to use a laser their bite for

851
00:47:58,680 --> 00:48:02,000
strength. I had it. I had it. It's incredible. I saw a video that was a

852
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:06,000
very good explanation of it was two dogs in a fight in like Central Park or

853
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:10,000
something, and people are like trying to get the dogs off each other, and the guy

854
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:13,880
said, and this blew my mind, he said, how would you feel? Of course, they're

855
00:48:13,880 --> 00:48:17,740
fighting. How would you feel if every time you walked by somebody, your

856
00:48:17,740 --> 00:48:22,420
boyfriend or whoever he didn't say boyfriend, whoever you're with, wanted

857
00:48:22,440 --> 00:48:26,080
you to shake the person's hand. Sometimes you're not going to like the guy.

858
00:48:26,080 --> 00:48:29,400
Sometimes you're just going to fight and try and get him and sometimes you

859
00:48:29,400 --> 00:48:33,000
he's saying this to two women screaming about their dogs fighting. No, he

860
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:36,640
basically did a green screen video where he's on top of the thing. He's pointing

861
00:48:36,640 --> 00:48:40,260
up. You see this. You see this is basically like if you had to shake hands

862
00:48:40,260 --> 00:48:43,520
with every single person in the world, I would do that. If I had to shake hands

863
00:48:43,520 --> 00:48:47,240
with people too, that's yeah, exactly. If I had to do that, first of all, I

864
00:48:47,240 --> 00:48:50,720
wouldn't leave my house, but if I was being dragged around by my neck and

865
00:48:50,760 --> 00:48:54,320
having made to shake hands with every single person. I would lash out not

866
00:48:54,320 --> 00:48:57,060
even because I don't like the people, but because I was bored. I don't want to

867
00:48:57,060 --> 00:49:03,580
shake your hand. I'm done shaking hand. Also, if I was bred for combat yeah, if I

868
00:49:03,580 --> 00:49:08,360
would that would so much worse pound the issue. If I was my jaw strength, if I

869
00:49:08,360 --> 00:49:11,880
could bite through a wooden door, if I was blood and I wasn't and I was

870
00:49:11,880 --> 00:49:16,600
punished for biting through a wooden door yeah, I'd be pissed yeah. I hate

871
00:49:16,640 --> 00:49:20,360
pit bulls. I don't I don't mind them that much. I just don't like that. They

872
00:49:20,360 --> 00:49:23,280
exist. There are a lot of times the sweetest dogs and the meanest dogs.

873
00:49:23,280 --> 00:49:27,120
Yeah, I don't care. I don't care. I don't care enough to get to know a

874
00:49:27,120 --> 00:49:31,200
people. Have you ever had somebody where you've made buddy meet somebody's pit

875
00:49:31,200 --> 00:49:34,920
bull and they tell you something insane? They're like you're like, Oh, how's the

876
00:49:34,920 --> 00:49:37,720
dog? You like the dog? They're like yeah, he's good. He's afraid of guns.

877
00:49:37,720 --> 00:49:38,840
It's like what

878
00:49:38,840 --> 00:49:45,200
what yeah. Also, when did you learn that like yeah, I can't say I ever had that

879
00:49:45,240 --> 00:49:48,680
That happened to my brother's dog, I think. I was like, "How is he?" He's like, "Yeah,

880
00:49:48,680 --> 00:49:52,000
he's afraid of guns." I would think so.

881
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:53,000
Yeah, I would hope.

882
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:54,000
Yeah.

883
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:56,800
My cat is afraid of trash bags. I don't know if that's because he's from the outside.

884
00:49:56,800 --> 00:50:00,000
My dog's afraid of trash. Anytime I take the trash out, he gets...

885
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:01,240
I'm afraid of trash bags.

886
00:50:01,240 --> 00:50:02,240
They're scary. They're white.

887
00:50:02,240 --> 00:50:05,240
Yeah, they're loud. When you open them up...

888
00:50:05,240 --> 00:50:06,240
Yeah.

889
00:50:06,240 --> 00:50:11,680
Yeah, my mom freaks the fuck out, dude. I don't know if he just saw a guy change the

890
00:50:11,680 --> 00:50:13,920
trash when he was living on the streets.

891
00:50:13,920 --> 00:50:20,640
probably thought the guy was going to put him in a trash bag. That's probably where he was

892
00:50:20,640 --> 00:50:26,280
going when I found him. He's probably going into a trash bag. He's going there again next

893
00:50:26,280 --> 00:50:31,160
time. I'm over. Did you guys know you guys weren't there? You guys were there before

894
00:50:31,160 --> 00:50:36,080
because I was on the stream and then I went home. We should start cat napping. Yeah, there's

895
00:50:36,080 --> 00:50:41,320
somebody else. There's somebody lost cat posters around. Yeah, I know. Oh, it's perfect time

896
00:50:41,320 --> 00:50:44,320
I'm to get it to the we should walk around with butterfly nets and just we

897
00:50:44,320 --> 00:50:48,280
should be setting baited trap. I saw the craziest fucking cat on a stoop the

898
00:50:48,280 --> 00:50:52,040
other day. It was like so it was like it looks like it was a white cat that

899
00:50:52,040 --> 00:50:55,120
turned. I knew it was great, but I had to turn black, a white cat that turned

900
00:50:55,120 --> 00:50:59,560
gray from dirt is what it looked like and it had the craziest green eyes

901
00:50:59,560 --> 00:51:01,160
and I

902
00:51:01,160 --> 00:51:05,080
weird. I know I know, but I let me

903
00:51:05,080 --> 00:51:10,120
cat's eyes are. Let me show you this cat. That's like the stereotypical cat's

904
00:51:10,160 --> 00:51:12,560
high color. Let me show you what this one looked like.

905
00:51:12,560 --> 00:51:16,800
You took a picture? Yeah, 'cause it looked scary. It does look scary.

906
00:51:16,800 --> 00:51:19,760
Look at how scary that thing was. That looks like a wolf. Yeah,

907
00:51:19,760 --> 00:51:22,800
that looks like a wolf. Yeah, that's a scary looking cat. Yeah.

908
00:51:22,800 --> 00:51:26,360
Now, you're completely right. The green eyes don't really bother me though.

909
00:51:26,360 --> 00:51:29,360
The green eyes are the scariest part of the way he's looking. I think the

910
00:51:29,360 --> 00:51:32,120
fact that he looks like a different animal is a weird... He's got snake eyes.

911
00:51:32,120 --> 00:51:35,640
He's got cat eyes. No, he's got snake's eyes with a cat's face. It is funny

912
00:51:35,640 --> 00:51:38,780
that the cat looked like that and you led by telling us just all the

913
00:51:38,780 --> 00:51:39,780
different colors that were

914
00:51:39,780 --> 00:51:44,380
yeah, it used to be white, but that was great and the eyes are green. That was a

915
00:51:44,380 --> 00:51:48,180
that was a creepy cat, though it was a creepy cat. Yeah, I did want to I did

916
00:51:48,180 --> 00:51:53,540
want to shake its paw. I think my next pet is going to be a skunk skunk. You

917
00:51:53,540 --> 00:51:55,340
can feel croaks skunk

918
00:51:55,340 --> 00:51:59,780
that you can do that. You can get remove their stink gland. It's not good for

919
00:51:59,780 --> 00:52:03,820
them. It's illegal in America. Yeah, you could also get a raccoon. You can get it

920
00:52:03,820 --> 00:52:07,220
done in the UK and then have shipped over here, but they also don't stink it up

921
00:52:07,260 --> 00:52:10,460
unless they're like really afraid. Yeah. So you got to become it's good for

922
00:52:10,460 --> 00:52:15,260
have you guys ever been skunked? Yeah, no, my uncle did, but then my house

923
00:52:15,260 --> 00:52:19,220
skunk like skunk. I got skunked around, but I didn't get skunked. I didn't get

924
00:52:19,220 --> 00:52:23,620
I ran. I ran. I saw a skunk. I ran. I was walking home one night and a skunk

925
00:52:23,620 --> 00:52:28,140
walked like one foot in front of me across the sidewalk and I froze like a

926
00:52:28,140 --> 00:52:32,180
cartoon. Yeah, and then I didn't skunk. It's not good. You have to bathe in

927
00:52:32,180 --> 00:52:35,260
honey tomato sauce. Tomato sauce is always what I honey would be to

928
00:52:35,300 --> 00:52:40,180
Yeah, my uncle who lived with me, one of them, one of my uncles that lived with me had his

929
00:52:40,180 --> 00:52:43,900
dog, he was walking him at night and then he got too, he tried to get too friendly with

930
00:52:43,900 --> 00:52:48,900
a skunk and he got sprayed so bad that we all heard him outside go like, "Ahh!"

931
00:52:48,900 --> 00:52:49,900
The dog?

932
00:52:49,900 --> 00:52:50,900
No, my uncle.

933
00:52:50,900 --> 00:52:51,900
Oh, okay.

934
00:52:51,900 --> 00:52:54,620
And then he came back inside and he was like, "I got fucking sprayed by a skunk!"

935
00:52:54,620 --> 00:52:57,780
I kind of want to get, I saw a video of somebody getting pepper sprayed the other day and it

936
00:52:57,780 --> 00:53:00,220
kind of, I think it's something you need to do before you die.

937
00:53:00,220 --> 00:53:01,220
Yeah, get pepper sprayed.

938
00:53:01,220 --> 00:53:02,220
Are you trying to build up an immunity?

939
00:53:02,220 --> 00:53:07,220
up an immunity? No, I just think I have curiosity. I can spray you with my girlfriend's pepper

940
00:53:07,220 --> 00:53:13,740
spray. The girl one won't work on me. Yeah, it never works. Trust me, I spray myself every

941
00:53:13,740 --> 00:53:19,260
single day. I want the one where you go with your thumb. The police one? Yeah, the police

942
00:53:19,260 --> 00:53:23,260
one. The video I saw was just a guy getting pulled over and he was like, "What are you

943
00:53:23,260 --> 00:53:29,020
pulling me over for?" And the guy was like, "That's it!" Right in his face. It doesn't

944
00:53:29,020 --> 00:53:33,100
don't look like it feels very I want to get I want to get tased. I want to

945
00:53:33,100 --> 00:53:39,060
live in that's like opposite, though sugar spray sugar spray and so yeah,

946
00:53:39,060 --> 00:53:42,700
tastes too good. Well, that's what I would do. It's a bunch of people

947
00:53:42,700 --> 00:53:47,580
sitting in a line protesting WGA writer strike and the I walk up and I just

948
00:53:47,580 --> 00:53:53,100
spray it into their mouth. What if it's a sour? What if it's just food spray

949
00:53:53,100 --> 00:53:57,220
and it makes them full so they get lazy? If someone's chasing you, you spray

950
00:53:57,260 --> 00:54:00,760
food on that's a pretty good idea mouth and then they're like they feel like

951
00:54:00,760 --> 00:54:03,460
they decided Thanksgiving dinner. Yeah, you know, I just want to sit down.

952
00:54:03,460 --> 00:54:07,740
They don't even Thanksgiving spray. Yeah, that's such a good basically

953
00:54:07,740 --> 00:54:11,260
Christmas. I'm going to spray Thanksgiving spray. Yeah, so these are

954
00:54:11,260 --> 00:54:14,620
all the same effect of filling your person. So this is Easter spread with

955
00:54:14,620 --> 00:54:19,100
turkey. So good turkey deep fried turkey for Christmas. An Easter meal. Yeah,

956
00:54:19,100 --> 00:54:24,060
I can't lamb and ham. I think you eat lamb on Easter. Isn't Jesus supposed to

957
00:54:24,060 --> 00:54:27,900
be a lamb. I think that's why you're supposed to eat him. Yeah, you eat him

958
00:54:27,900 --> 00:54:31,420
all the time. The guy's the most eating person ever live. Yeah, you know the

959
00:54:31,420 --> 00:54:35,460
whole thing. Isn't it funny that Catholics the it's like Catholic canon

960
00:54:35,460 --> 00:54:39,620
that when you eat the piece of bread, it becomes human flesh in your body. Yeah,

961
00:54:39,620 --> 00:54:42,900
really yeah, I've never had the communion because I've never been you've

962
00:54:42,900 --> 00:54:45,900
never taken communion. No, because I have never I've never been confirmed

963
00:54:45,900 --> 00:54:49,220
communion. I wasn't allowed to do Catholic communion. I wasn't allowed to

964
00:54:49,220 --> 00:54:50,020
do CCD

965
00:54:51,220 --> 00:54:56,900
because my... Are you, what do they call it, confirmed? No. Wow. Hell. My whole... Hell

966
00:54:56,900 --> 00:55:02,060
vibe. Are you baptized? I was baptized. Oh. That's weird. I wasn't confirmed because my

967
00:55:02,060 --> 00:55:09,980
aunt was the CCD teacher at the church that we would go to. Uh-huh. And she said she did

968
00:55:09,980 --> 00:55:14,020
not want me in her classroom. Whoa. They didn't want me in the classroom. She'd rather have

969
00:55:14,020 --> 00:55:17,700
you in hell. We couldn't afford it. Yeah. She didn't like me. She didn't like me at

970
00:55:17,700 --> 00:55:21,860
should rather have you in hell than in her classroom. That's crazy. We couldn't

971
00:55:21,860 --> 00:55:25,660
afford this easy D classes, but also like I know you were crazy as kid. I was I

972
00:55:25,660 --> 00:55:28,800
would have I would have said the same. I would sit in the back. I would have

973
00:55:28,800 --> 00:55:32,780
either this. Can we transfer this kid to hell? Yeah, during my during my

974
00:55:32,780 --> 00:55:38,680
cousin's, my cousins, like confirmation my my cousin, who I was my cousin Rob

975
00:55:38,680 --> 00:55:43,180
same age as him. I'm in the back in the quiet room where all the old ladies sit

976
00:55:43,180 --> 00:55:47,380
and I'm sitting there just turning to my mom just going. This is a fucking boring.

977
00:55:47,420 --> 00:55:50,580
I was in saying fucking this is so boring. Do you remember the first time you

978
00:55:50,580 --> 00:55:55,260
cussed in a church? I do know I never cussed in church. I cussed in church.

979
00:55:55,260 --> 00:55:59,980
Would you say damn? I said fuck. That's the first thing I ever said. You just

980
00:55:59,980 --> 00:56:03,340
said fuck. I just said fuck. My buddy Jordan said you're not allowed to cuss

981
00:56:03,340 --> 00:56:05,500
in church and I was like fuck that

982
00:56:05,500 --> 00:56:10,100
holy and then I immediately felt like a shock of electricity in my body and

983
00:56:10,100 --> 00:56:13,980
knew I'm going to hell and it basically colored the rest of my life and then I

984
00:56:14,020 --> 00:56:16,580
went outside and I climbed the tallest tree on the church grounds.

985
00:56:16,580 --> 00:56:19,220
Well, that's just like youth camp stuff.

986
00:56:19,220 --> 00:56:20,220
That's what I used to do.

987
00:56:20,220 --> 00:56:21,220
That's what your counselor wants you to do.

988
00:56:21,220 --> 00:56:24,860
I thought it was cool because I would go and I would climb the tree alone.

989
00:56:24,860 --> 00:56:25,860
The tree climber kid.

990
00:56:25,860 --> 00:56:29,300
Yeah, and then just sit up there and wait for somebody to look at me and be like, "Look

991
00:56:29,300 --> 00:56:30,300
how high I am."

992
00:56:30,300 --> 00:56:31,300
Yeah.

993
00:56:31,300 --> 00:56:32,300
This is me.

994
00:56:32,300 --> 00:56:33,300
"Look how high I am."

995
00:56:33,300 --> 00:56:34,300
The other kids are fucking.

996
00:56:34,300 --> 00:56:35,300
I remember the tree climber kid in school.

997
00:56:35,300 --> 00:56:36,300
Yeah, that was me.

998
00:56:36,300 --> 00:56:38,100
I loved climbing trees.

999
00:56:38,100 --> 00:56:40,100
I had a phase of climbing trees.

1000
00:56:40,100 --> 00:56:41,100
And then I grew up in a cantry.

1001
00:56:41,100 --> 00:56:42,780
I had a tree climbing phase.

1002
00:56:42,780 --> 00:56:43,780
Never?

1003
00:56:43,780 --> 00:56:48,420
You don't like heights. No, I mean heights. I would get up on maybe a low

1004
00:56:48,420 --> 00:56:52,100
branch, but yeah, I never I also just wasn't I wasn't like strong. I would get

1005
00:56:52,100 --> 00:56:56,540
to the top of the tree and I would wave side to side in the wind. Wow. I also

1006
00:56:56,540 --> 00:56:59,460
hate heights. Now that I'm thinking, I don't think any human likes heights. I

1007
00:56:59,460 --> 00:57:02,700
think that's supposed to like heights. No, they're not good. I did like that. I

1008
00:57:02,700 --> 00:57:08,060
really don't like this. I don't like even being inside in heights. Yeah, yeah. I

1009
00:57:08,060 --> 00:57:12,820
went. If I'm in a building that's too big, I'd get scared. If I'm in a movie

1010
00:57:12,820 --> 00:57:15,780
theater and I have to take an escalator up and I know that I'm on the third

1011
00:57:15,780 --> 00:57:17,280
floor and I know that there's

1012
00:57:17,280 --> 00:57:22,320
floors below me, but the tall floors, I think that's probably a measure of your

1013
00:57:22,320 --> 00:57:26,260
intelligence that you are, because everybody else is too stupid to get

1014
00:57:26,260 --> 00:57:30,020
fooled into thinking they're on the ground. I was in a building once where

1015
00:57:30,020 --> 00:57:33,740
like my ears, we were on the fucking penthouse. It was like me and Tom,

1016
00:57:33,740 --> 00:57:38,140
whoa, show, we did the show that was in a penthouse bragging and bragging

1017
00:57:38,180 --> 00:57:42,880
and my ears were popping my ears popped one in the elevator in the elevator, my

1018
00:57:42,880 --> 00:57:47,120
ears, but on the elevator and then no, but we were on the balcony after and

1019
00:57:47,120 --> 00:57:52,440
you were so scared. I almost threw up because I was there to I looked I looked

1020
00:57:52,440 --> 00:57:55,980
down and I almost threw up because of the height.

1021
00:57:55,980 --> 00:58:00,620
It wasn't a rag that right yeah, you were in a penthouse. I've never been in

1022
00:58:00,620 --> 00:58:03,340
a penthouse. You could have come to the show, been a penthouse. I have you. I

1023
00:58:03,340 --> 00:58:07,180
invited you. I invited you guys to come to the show. I don't want to go to a

1024
00:58:07,200 --> 00:58:12,680
penthouse show. I want the first time I go into a penthouse, it's going to be my

1025
00:58:12,680 --> 00:58:17,240
penthouse yeah, that's the plan, but they got the people who ran the penthouse.

1026
00:58:17,240 --> 00:58:20,000
I'm gonna have that swan made out of towels. They weren't allowed to do shows

1027
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:23,680
there anymore. I want to do that the doorman said that the doorman found out

1028
00:58:23,680 --> 00:58:24,800
it was a ticketed event

1029
00:58:24,800 --> 00:58:31,880
doorman also another job in the that the people's business yeah doorman your

1030
00:58:31,880 --> 00:58:36,600
entire job is to get a shitty Christmas gift and fucking shut the fuck up.

1031
00:58:36,640 --> 00:58:39,700
Phillips Norelco one blade. Here's actually that's a great Christmas gift.

1032
00:58:39,700 --> 00:58:42,980
Open the door, buddy. Yeah. Hey, why don't you do your job and open the door?

1033
00:58:42,980 --> 00:58:46,620
You're not an undercover cop. Oh, are you? Oh, is your what's your job title?

1034
00:58:46,620 --> 00:58:51,240
Are you a how was your day man? No, I don't think so. So shut your trap and

1035
00:58:51,240 --> 00:58:53,660
open my door. Press the button.

1036
00:58:53,660 --> 00:58:57,740
What but for the elevator or something? I don't know what they do. I don't like

1037
00:58:57,740 --> 00:59:04,160
I don't like any job where you're not a CEO and you wear a suit. I don't like

1038
00:59:04,180 --> 00:59:09,700
seeing people every day also. I don't want to see the same guy a bunch of times.

1039
00:59:09,700 --> 00:59:13,100
I would really appreciate it if the people in my apartment building would move

1040
00:59:13,100 --> 00:59:14,100
out after a month.

1041
00:59:14,100 --> 00:59:17,700
His Siri responded to him saying Santa.

1042
00:59:17,700 --> 00:59:20,820
He called Santa?

1043
00:59:20,820 --> 00:59:21,900
I guess so.

1044
00:59:21,900 --> 00:59:23,220
Hey Santa.

1045
00:59:23,220 --> 00:59:24,820
It didn't work this time.

1046
00:59:24,820 --> 00:59:30,260
Also, I would so much rather have a security guard with a Gatling gun or

1047
00:59:30,260 --> 00:59:31,700
maybe a sentry turret.

1048
00:59:31,700 --> 00:59:33,740
Literally, what's his name from Final Fantasy VII?

1049
00:59:33,780 --> 00:59:41,680
my God, but anyway, I just think that doorman get rid of them or everybody

1050
00:59:41,680 --> 00:59:44,080
should have one. How about that? Well, actually, we're talking we're talking

1051
00:59:44,080 --> 00:59:48,700
about doorman the week that you weren't here as I have had. I actually have a

1052
00:59:48,700 --> 00:59:53,160
doorman theory, which is I think that the reason that we don't have chivalry

1053
00:59:53,160 --> 00:59:57,840
anymore in this in our modern world yeah is because why would you hold the door

1054
00:59:57,840 --> 01:00:02,340
for somebody when you can get paid for it when it's an actual job you can have?

1055
01:00:02,500 --> 01:00:06,160
why would you do it for free? Miss the moneymaker symposium wow that's a

1056
01:00:06,160 --> 01:00:10,080
really good point right like it's capitalism is basically ruining fucking

1057
01:00:10,080 --> 01:00:13,280
shit for us. I wouldn't take it that far, but

1058
01:00:13,280 --> 01:00:18,360
slow your fucking roll, but yeah I'm like I'm not going to hold that. Oh,

1059
01:00:18,360 --> 01:00:21,400
I'm going to hold the door for you. Okay, where's my where's my salary?

1060
01:00:21,400 --> 01:00:25,700
Yeah, no, where's my salary? Yeah, also I think you get paid pretty well to be a

1061
01:00:25,700 --> 01:00:28,640
doorman, which is you have to I mean it's where you live in the building,

1062
01:00:28,680 --> 01:00:32,680
that is the most now boring job of all you don't live in the bill. They don't

1063
01:00:32,680 --> 01:00:37,080
give you a room fuck. No, what they're doing like the nicest apartments. You

1064
01:00:37,080 --> 01:00:39,680
think that they're going to give it some fucking doorman. It was

1065
01:00:39,680 --> 01:00:44,380
probably live in the in the Freddy Krueger basement. Yeah, yeah, you live

1066
01:00:44,380 --> 01:00:47,980
in the Freddy Krueger basement and you get a huge pay cut. That's why you get

1067
01:00:47,980 --> 01:00:51,080
a free. I've always thought a fun job. It has to be to be a super. I bet that

1068
01:00:51,080 --> 01:00:56,380
more than fifty percent of doorman are serial killers. It's got to be way more.

1069
01:00:56,380 --> 01:01:00,220
it's closer to a hundred. Yeah, I think it has to be a huge percent are doing

1070
01:01:00,220 --> 01:01:05,220
bad and bad, bad things. Yeah, bad. If I know that they also are like every

1071
01:01:05,220 --> 01:01:08,020
once in a while, they're like they say something to somebody and they're like,

1072
01:01:08,020 --> 01:01:10,260
"Whoa, how'd you know that?" And they're like, "Well, you know, I'm the

1073
01:01:10,260 --> 01:01:12,740
doorman. I'm the eyes and ears of this building." It's like that shit where

1074
01:01:12,740 --> 01:01:17,540
you're like, "Oh, I'm so embarrassed to

1075
01:01:17,540 --> 01:01:21,620
say this issue I'm having to my doctor, 'cause my doctor's gonna judge me."

1076
01:01:21,620 --> 01:01:24,460
And they're like, "No, doctors don't judge you." And then you find out that

1077
01:01:24,460 --> 01:01:27,820
that they all have a secret text group and they're all texting about you. They

1078
01:01:27,820 --> 01:01:32,220
have every job is it's always every single job in the world always judges

1079
01:01:32,220 --> 01:01:34,580
you and they all have their little things. They say about you to the

1080
01:01:34,580 --> 01:01:37,580
therefore, their other friends who work the same job. They're doctors are

1081
01:01:37,580 --> 01:01:41,540
definitely doctors where when some when you walk in, they go every doctor fuck

1082
01:01:41,540 --> 01:01:45,660
me every single day. It's a job. There are like nobody like yeah, nobody is

1083
01:01:45,660 --> 01:01:49,140
definitely a doctor group. Everybody gossips about you everywhere you go.

1084
01:01:49,140 --> 01:01:53,060
This you break your pelvis. They make sure they make your penis look smaller

1085
01:01:53,100 --> 01:01:56,400
and the door man sees who you come. I seen that happen to me and the door man

1086
01:01:56,400 --> 01:02:00,060
sees who you come home with yeah, who you have, who what kind of friends are

1087
01:02:00,060 --> 01:02:05,400
having over what kind of friends you're having over, so what kind of groceries

1088
01:02:05,400 --> 01:02:07,940
you're bringing in groceries. I was just going to say what kind of things you're

1089
01:02:07,940 --> 01:02:12,120
getting on Uber eats yeah. How often you're getting Uber eats, what packages

1090
01:02:12,120 --> 01:02:16,560
you're getting yeah, who was it? It was Samantha on sex in the city who had sex

1091
01:02:16,560 --> 01:02:21,060
with her door man. They have sex with you yeah, no it was a door knob. Oh yeah,

1092
01:02:21,100 --> 01:02:25,140
she fucked a door knob. Yeah, she was a complete slug. Such a slut. She fucked

1093
01:02:25,140 --> 01:02:29,700
a door. She fucked a door and then she fucked a boat and she fucked all this

1094
01:02:29,700 --> 01:02:34,540
other crap. Yeah, and now that's why she's not in and just like that. Look at

1095
01:02:34,540 --> 01:02:38,920
this salary, doorman salary, twenty to twenty seven dollars per hour. That's

1096
01:02:38,920 --> 01:02:42,940
not bad. That's too much full time employment, technology, information and

1097
01:02:42,940 --> 01:02:47,400
internet industry. You're trying to get paid to stand. Yeah, this is bullshit and

1098
01:02:47,420 --> 01:02:52,060
requirements, good communication skills, bilingual, have a can do whatever it

1099
01:02:52,060 --> 01:02:53,800
takes attitude for

1100
01:02:53,800 --> 01:02:56,240
whatever it takes to open this door.

1101
01:02:56,240 --> 01:02:59,740
Door fit is the tallest,

1102
01:02:59,740 --> 01:03:01,580
in the world,

1103
01:03:01,580 --> 01:03:07,180
the only reason you think that actually no, I think you'd be a good bell.

1104
01:03:07,180 --> 01:03:12,580
Whoa, my last name ability, ability to strip and wax floors as a plus bell

1105
01:03:12,580 --> 01:03:16,100

1106
01:03:16,140 --> 01:03:19,740
shouldn't be that's not the door man. Yeah, that's what I would say. This is my dorm

1107
01:03:19,740 --> 01:03:25,340
main anything beyond that exactly. Thank you. Scroll up, scroll up. They changed it

1108
01:03:25,340 --> 01:03:32,060
up more, up more. They changed it from bellhop to bell person. Oh my yeah.

1109
01:03:32,060 --> 01:03:37,020
Notice the rainbow on the logo for this hotel. Don't give these any clicks. Okay,

1110
01:03:37,020 --> 01:03:41,100
get off of get off of this. What's up was hop not gender neutral. You're not

1111
01:03:41,100 --> 01:03:45,860
going to become a bell person. Jubio maybe Jubio, but I'm a fucking bell hop.

1112
01:03:45,980 --> 01:03:53,180
yeah, what's a girl bell hop? Then if a boy bell hop is a bell hip yeah, a hip and

1113
01:03:53,180 --> 01:03:56,820

1114
01:03:56,820 --> 01:04:00,760
guard, yo I would become that way to have the brains logo. Does the brings

1115
01:04:00,760 --> 01:04:04,900

1116
01:04:04,900 --> 01:04:09,780
that on a shirt to stuff like you know, LGBT stuff like Bank of America, yeah,

1117
01:04:09,780 --> 01:04:13,720
yeah, that seems like a pretty fun job, because you're the whole thing is like

1118
01:04:13,760 --> 01:04:18,300
it's it's hilarious how hard it is to rob you. Do you guys know you guys ever

1119
01:04:18,300 --> 01:04:21,860
walk by an armored truck that's parked somewhere and you think to yourself like

1120
01:04:21,860 --> 01:04:24,460
I hope they don't kill me. Hope they don't think I'm trying to steal from

1121
01:04:24,460 --> 01:04:28,060
because they're covered in guns. I got my I hope they don't mistake me for a

1122
01:04:28,060 --> 01:04:30,940
guy who's trying to get into the truck. I was walking home at like two in the

1123
01:04:30,940 --> 01:04:34,860
morning a couple months ago and they were like the guys were just sitting

1124
01:04:34,860 --> 01:04:38,640
looking the other way with like fifty thousand dollars and twenty dollars

1125
01:04:38,640 --> 01:04:41,740
bills there and they're just like smoking cigarettes waiting for their

1126
01:04:41,760 --> 01:04:45,960
dog break to be over. I was like this would be the easy, and you know me, I'm always looking

1127
01:04:45,960 --> 01:04:52,960
for a lick. I was like this would be the easiest lick. Kill these two guys, take this money.

1128
01:04:52,960 --> 01:04:54,960
Who's going to ever know?

1129
01:04:54,960 --> 01:04:58,440
They got cameras all over the truck. Every single part of the truck has a camera on it.

1130
01:04:58,440 --> 01:05:01,120
I have a camera? Fuck it.

1131
01:05:01,120 --> 01:05:05,560
But here's the thing, the Brinks truck has cameras on every single part of it. Couldn't

1132
01:05:05,560 --> 01:05:09,640
they make an amazing reality TV show about traffic with the same truck?

1133
01:05:09,640 --> 01:05:12,940
Well, that's what I was going to get at is that we should do a parks and rack

1134
01:05:12,940 --> 01:05:16,360
about two three guys in a brinks truck. That's actually a really good idea.

1135
01:05:16,360 --> 01:05:20,200
Parks and driving is what it could be called parking. That's actually driving.

1136
01:05:20,200 --> 01:05:23,600
That is actually such a good idea. And it's a brinks truck. It has all the

1137
01:05:23,600 --> 01:05:27,200
cameras all over it, and it's like those three sixty cameras, and they're going

1138
01:05:27,200 --> 01:05:30,520
into like into people's cars. Yeah, we just get it. We buy a brinks truck, an

1139
01:05:30,520 --> 01:05:34,760
old retired brinks truck, or we just steal one. We put some three sixty. We

1140
01:05:34,760 --> 01:05:37,000
leave all the money. We steal the truck, but leave all the money. The problem

1141
01:05:37,040 --> 01:05:40,000
is that people are going to think it's a real brinks truck and try to rob us and

1142
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:44,640
all of our guns are they're funny guns. They don't do anything. They're props.

1143
01:05:44,640 --> 01:05:49,040
Exactly. And also we don't have any money. Yeah, there's no money at all.

1144
01:05:49,040 --> 01:05:54,400
Yeah, just us. Just our bodies. Well, that's what we could have. We could be

1145
01:05:54,400 --> 01:05:58,880
it could be like in a like a more like friends or how I met your mother or

1146
01:05:58,880 --> 01:06:03,360
something. It's like an apartment, apartment comedy. So like you bring over

1147
01:06:03,360 --> 01:06:06,560
a girl into the brinks. We all live there. We all live in a brink. You bring

1148
01:06:06,560 --> 01:06:10,180
going over the girl into the Brinks truck, you're shooting not on her face.

1149
01:06:10,180 --> 01:06:11,520
Oh, not on the money.

1150
01:06:11,520 --> 01:06:18,160
Come on, not on all the fucking money man. I wasn't aiming for the girl,

1151
01:06:18,160 --> 01:06:20,560
you're popping quarters in her ass. Shut up

1152
01:06:20,560 --> 01:06:26,000
stop man. You have the thing is coming on money. You have the

1153
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:31,800
the like thing that slides like the like I slit the between the divider and

1154
01:06:31,800 --> 01:06:35,360
like the guys fucking the girl in the back and the two guys are in the cab and

1155
01:06:35,400 --> 01:06:39,500
just sitting there. It's like are you guys done like closet? He slides it

1156
01:06:39,500 --> 01:06:41,360
open, slides it open to the night comes

1157
01:06:41,360 --> 01:06:44,300
the guy having a

1158
01:06:44,300 --> 01:06:47,580
it's all about noting. This would be this would be the scene. I would bring

1159
01:06:47,580 --> 01:06:51,160
truck for a sperm bank. He would say, oh, that's a good idea. What are you

1160
01:06:51,160 --> 01:06:54,400
trying to look at the I'm looking for the applause, but he would say he would

1161
01:06:54,400 --> 01:06:57,900
say, Hey, I'm bringing a girl. You dropped your phone here. You go to the

1162
01:06:57,900 --> 01:07:01,340
applause, go to the applause thing real quick, though this is going to flop.

1163
01:07:01,340 --> 01:07:05,160
You you do your thing, you do your thing. So the whole thing it would be you and

1164
01:07:05,200 --> 01:07:08,640
you like I'm having a girl over night, be like to again man, because your

1165
01:07:08,640 --> 01:07:12,360
character gets pussy a lot. He's kind of a cool one and we'd be like whatever

1166
01:07:12,360 --> 01:07:13,780
Patrick, not you.

1167
01:07:13,780 --> 01:07:18,760
I wasn't giving you the thumbs up. Yeah, Patrick's like the cool one in the show,

1168
01:07:18,760 --> 01:07:22,880
but you'd be like yeah, I'm having a girl over tonight, like like the guy and

1169
01:07:22,880 --> 01:07:26,600
funny people, that kind of guy and then you would have the girl over and then it

1170
01:07:26,600 --> 01:07:31,240
cuts to you and me. We're listening to car talk, an old car talk episode,

1171
01:07:31,280 --> 01:07:32,400
armored car talk arm.

1172
01:07:32,400 --> 01:07:37,240
We're listening or actually we're recording our podcast armored car talk

1173
01:07:37,240 --> 01:07:41,160

1175
01:07:46,920 --> 01:07:49,660

1176
01:07:49,660 --> 01:07:57,040
can we have to get you a water? The waters of the front and then we can we

1177
01:07:57,040 --> 01:08:00,480
have to get out and go into the gas station to get by bottle water. Then

1178
01:08:00,560 --> 01:08:04,140
basically the guy from like dragged across concrete to gets in with the

1179
01:08:04,140 --> 01:08:07,500
fucking ski mask and he gets in and he's he's stealing the truck. He thinks

1180
01:08:07,500 --> 01:08:10,620
there's money in the back. He's trying to drive it to a secret base or

1181
01:08:10,620 --> 01:08:14,340
whatever. Yeah, he like turns and opens to the slot to see how much money he

1182
01:08:14,340 --> 01:08:18,780
stole. He sees him and the girl and they're going at it froggy style,

1183
01:08:18,780 --> 01:08:22,360
post coital and they're smoking cigarettes, lay on a bed of money. He

1184
01:08:22,360 --> 01:08:23,580
opens it and the smoke comes in.

1185
01:08:23,580 --> 01:08:28,540
This is what did I is this a decoy truck? There's there's a smoke bomb

1186
01:08:28,580 --> 01:08:33,540
we're trying to make an escape or we we bring in the water and he's like thank

1187
01:08:33,540 --> 01:08:37,180
you and then we like he like closes the thing and then we hear him go like oh

1188
01:08:37,180 --> 01:08:39,020
yeah, I'm pouring water on your ass,

1189
01:08:39,020 --> 01:08:41,380
not even drinking the water,

1190
01:08:41,380 --> 01:08:45,940
but then the the episode episode starts right. It's like you guys,

my uncle's coming over my uncle's coming over same exact episode, same exact

1192
01:08:51,100 --> 01:08:54,860
episode. This is how it starts out in the back. My uncle's coming over back of

1193
01:08:54,860 --> 01:08:55,820
the truck opens up

1194
01:08:55,820 --> 01:08:58,260
back of the truck opens up

1195
01:08:58,260 --> 01:09:07,500
uncle's head pops in. Hello, it's me, the president. It's Donald Trump. Damn it.

1196
01:09:07,500 --> 01:09:14,700
Wait, Warren Buffett. No, wait, Donald Trump's your uncle in the show. That's

1197
01:09:14,700 --> 01:09:18,500
why I get so much pussy. You're his dead brother's son. Yeah. So you're like

1198
01:09:18,500 --> 01:09:22,900
60. That was you were going to want applause for that. Yeah. For the Donald

1199
01:09:22,900 --> 01:09:26,260
Trump impression doing the Donald Trump. No, it's going to be him walking into

1200
01:09:26,260 --> 01:09:32,500
truck. So imagine it's like the the celebrity cameo on a sitcom. Oh, so

1201
01:09:32,500 --> 01:09:37,260
Trump. So it's not supposed to be applauding. No, no, no. Okay, then I

1202
01:09:37,260 --> 01:09:40,620
get the I get why you're saying it. I'll give you a plus for that. Okay, so

1203
01:09:40,620 --> 01:09:46,980
it's the his head pops in. Yeah. Hello. Yeah. Big applause break. He like start

1204
01:09:46,980 --> 01:09:50,660
tries to start his line a couple of times and he keeps getting cut off by

1205
01:09:50,660 --> 01:09:56,120
by the applause yeah, yeah, what what what where's all the money yeah, where's all

1206
01:09:56,120 --> 01:10:00,100
the where's all the money in the where's all the money in the trip, where's all

1207
01:10:00,100 --> 01:10:02,920
the money in the truck, where's all the money in the truck

1208
01:10:02,920 --> 01:10:08,280
now and then even then it gets robbed, but then he gets shot first left track

1209
01:10:08,280 --> 01:10:12,520
with air horns on it. Yeah, after every time I should do that

1210
01:10:12,520 --> 01:10:16,840
yeah, I can do that laugh tracks. Now people are so used to a point of a laugh

1211
01:10:16,840 --> 01:10:19,320
track, you know to get you to laugh and then warn you up or whatever everybody's

1212
01:10:19,360 --> 01:10:22,360
list of that by now that everything has a left track that you hear the laughter

1213
01:10:22,360 --> 01:10:25,560
and it's like it does. It doesn't even register to you that it's happening to

1214
01:10:25,560 --> 01:10:29,600
me, so you need something with a little more punch, maybe a machine gun.

1215
01:10:29,600 --> 01:10:32,400
Well, I think the drums are

1216
01:10:32,400 --> 01:10:36,500
that's enough of that yeah enough of the air horn.

1217
01:10:36,500 --> 01:10:40,500
All right, I need one more episode idea before the episode.

1218
01:10:40,500 --> 01:10:47,700
I need one more guys. The truck breaks down in the middle of nowhere and we eat

1219
01:10:47,760 --> 01:10:52,360
money have to eat the money and live in a forest or no in a day that oh that's a

1220
01:10:52,360 --> 01:10:55,800
great idea, because then it's this kind of lesson episode where it's like if

1221
01:10:55,800 --> 01:11:00,120
without all this city around us without the truck, you can't drive

1222
01:11:00,120 --> 01:11:04,480
the truck doesn't go without all the city around us. We you can be stuck there

1223
01:11:04,480 --> 01:11:07,160
with ten million dollars. It doesn't it doesn't even yeah yeah yeah it's

1224
01:11:07,160 --> 01:11:10,760
basically an episode that shows that money has no inherent value and it's

1225
01:11:10,760 --> 01:11:12,200
simply a societal.

1226
01:11:13,160 --> 01:11:19,320
Here's an idea for an episode. So we are short on rent for the truck this month.

1227
01:11:19,320 --> 01:11:20,320
We rent the truck.

1228
01:11:20,320 --> 01:11:25,440
We rent the truck. We're short on rent for the truck. We get the greatest idea in the

1229
01:11:25,440 --> 01:11:26,440
world.

1230
01:11:26,440 --> 01:11:27,440
Steal the money.

1231
01:11:27,440 --> 01:11:31,560
No, we don't touch the money. We turn the truck into...

1232
01:11:31,560 --> 01:11:32,560
Ice cream.

1233
01:11:32,560 --> 01:11:33,560
Ice cream truck.

1234
01:11:33,560 --> 01:11:34,560
Nice.

1235
01:11:34,560 --> 01:11:35,560
Yes.

1236
01:11:35,560 --> 01:11:38,640
But then we get into trouble because we accidentally serve like big wads of thousands of dollars

1237
01:11:38,640 --> 01:11:41,160
to kids on an ice cream cone.

1238
01:11:41,160 --> 01:11:43,960
but we're the heroes of the neighborhood. So it's between keeping our job. We're

1239
01:11:43,960 --> 01:11:48,500
like John God becoming the heroes of Astoria and it's in Astoria. Yeah, the

1240
01:11:48,500 --> 01:11:50,860
whole thing is in the store and it's called the Kings of and then we're about

1241
01:11:50,860 --> 01:11:53,820
to and then we're about we're about to make the decision that we want to be the

1242
01:11:53,820 --> 01:11:57,740
heroes. We don't want to keep our jobs and then we find out that every kid who

1243
01:11:57,740 --> 01:12:00,100
was coming up and ordering an ice cream cone that we thought we were

1244
01:12:00,100 --> 01:12:04,420
accidentally giving the money. Yeah, they were all paid actors by criminals who

1245
01:12:04,420 --> 01:12:07,840
knew that money was being given out. The kids are all working for a criminal

1246
01:12:07,860 --> 01:12:11,400
organization. Everyone that we interacted with was a criminal who was

1247
01:12:11,400 --> 01:12:15,060
stealing the money on purpose, and we realized that we have to do our job,

1248
01:12:15,060 --> 01:12:17,780
because there's no one else in the world who can do it. We go in and that's

1249
01:12:17,780 --> 01:12:21,540
another another sorry. Another little the nookie starts playing. We jump out

1250
01:12:21,540 --> 01:12:24,260
of the cars with the guns that are in there and we shoot all the kids. Also,

1251
01:12:24,260 --> 01:12:26,320
we play okey money yeah and we

1252
01:12:26,320 --> 01:12:30,540
we all not on the last guy has to go buy something with the money.

1253
01:12:30,540 --> 01:12:32,740
That's a great

1254
01:12:32,740 --> 01:12:36,420
the last kind of comments to go by

1255
01:12:36,420 --> 01:12:36,920
Minnesota

1256
01:12:36,920 --> 01:12:44,160
it has to be in your wallet.

1257
01:12:44,160 --> 01:12:46,480
It's just like

1258
01:12:46,480 --> 01:12:54,880
a good game. Yeah, you're just telling the guy like sometimes money does this.

1259
01:12:54,880 --> 01:12:58,680
I don't know. I don't know why. Yeah, I guess I had a piece of gum in my

1260
01:12:58,680 --> 01:13:00,920
wallet, but the guy knows it's an old weathered man.

1261
01:13:00,920 --> 01:13:04,320
I know you were playing Oki money. You piece of shit.

1262
01:13:04,320 --> 01:13:08,320
money. We used to play a guy never played Okie money. I was the game. I

1263
01:13:08,320 --> 01:13:13,760
invented Okie money. My name is Michael and he cleans the dollar off with his

1264
01:13:13,760 --> 01:13:18,400
slurping mouth. Yeah, well, it's dry by now. He's crazy. Yeah, you have to do

1265
01:13:18,400 --> 01:13:22,120
it immediately. So it's wet. Oh yeah, true. Yeah, right. Well, all right, we
