Yes.

I like it.

41
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,340
I do kind of like it being an early on,

42
00:01:01,340 --> 00:01:04,080
I like it being kind of a limited thing at this point, right?

43
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:06,400
There's only, somebody listened to this episode right now

44
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:08,120
and said, "This is my new favorite podcast.

45
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:10,480
"I can't wait to listen to this every single day at work."

46
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:13,600
They don't even get two weeks of fucking listening.

47
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:14,440
And then they're like, "Well, fuck it, I just gotta wait."

48
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:15,980
- You better have a part-time job.

49
00:01:15,980 --> 00:01:20,760
- Exactly, a one-hour-a-day job for 12 days.

50
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:22,000
- That's my job right there.

51
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,160
- True, that is, yep, Juby has a job that he has no call,

52
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:28,440
no showed twice in the last month.

53
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:31,040
Yes.

54
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:32,240
Good ass employee.

55
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:33,560
He's an amazing employee.

56
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:37,880
So today I have a Bush beer.

57
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:40,040
Wow.

58
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:41,040
Wow.

59
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:42,480
Bush beer. Favorite part.

60
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:44,480
OK, so there's a lot of things I like about the Bush beer.

61
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:46,920
I had I told my wife I was gone.

62
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:48,160
She was like, I'm at the grocery store.

63
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:50,760
Do you want me to pick up your your beers that you will drink?

64
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:52,720
And I said, yeah.

65
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:54,880
She said, what do you want? I said, surprise me.

66
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:59,160
Okay. I said, which is dangerous.

67
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:04,360
Yeah. And she got maybe the worst beer in the world.

68
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:06,680
It's the big one.

69
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:10,120
Yeah. Well, it is the big one. And how big you might ask?

70
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:14,440
A perfectly normal amount, 25 fluid ounces.

71
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:22,120
Not 16, not 24, 25. Most beers would say, I want to be 24 ounces. Nope.

72
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:27,040
The limerido is coming to 25 ounce can.

73
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:30,680
This is so funny. It's actually not that bad though.

74
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:34,000
It's funny because I kind of had like not a

75
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,320
like a similar situation but I did go to the grocery store with my girlfriend

76
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:41,360
and I was like I need to get like a funny I need to get the funniest beer in here

77
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:44,400
because Rex always shows up with something stupid

78
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:47,480
yeah and I always have like something that I just picked out of the fridge that we had

79
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:47,920
from like

80
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:52,360
for like a month. You always have wack ass beers. You're known as the wack beer guy.

81
00:02:52,360 --> 00:03:01,400
Okay well speaking of that I would like to it is my beer last because I think it's it's a it's a certain case of a heater yeah holy.

82
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:05,760
I'm drinking the lavender lemonade hard kombucha.

83
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:13,720
Okay as we've seen that one before it's a repeat it is well I you know I introduced three beers last time and drink that's that's true.

84
00:03:13,940 --> 00:03:32,180
That's a repeat of the idea to do that so you get to see a kind of burn your you burned a lot of material there that is true kind of a weird choice not next year shows the be that we saw last week and we like oh yeah we saw that one like two weeks is enough to completely forget what happened.

85
00:03:32,740 --> 00:03:43,140

Six, six, six, the number of the beast.

Rex?

111
00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:48,680

So I will be drinking my tonight's beer on my tonight's boot.

118
00:04:59,180 --> 00:05:06,880
You're so silly.

00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:08,520
I love, I've missed you guys.

120
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:09,360
Wow.

121
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:10,880

122
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:12,240
It has, it has.

123
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:13,080
One week.

124
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:14,420
It's a splash of coke.

125
00:05:14,420 --> 00:05:16,720
These are two of the biggest geniuses

126
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:19,600
I've ever known in my life.

127
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:20,440
I know.

128
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:21,800
I think it's the worst pour of my entire life.

129
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:22,640
I forgot that.

130
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:23,460
Let me see that head.

131
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:34,460
on that thing. Oh my! That dude's wearing ankle socks. Wow, what a boot. He's wearing the

132
00:05:34,460 --> 00:05:40,260
no-show socks. Yeah, I forgot about that shit. And he's got a brown leg. That's too beautiful.

133
00:05:40,260 --> 00:05:47,620
Big brown leg, white brown, white as shit. It actually does look exactly, wait show the

134
00:05:47,620 --> 00:05:52,220
camera, that looks like your skin color leg. That's what would happen if you wore an amber

135
00:05:52,220 --> 00:05:58,220
true. That's not true. It is true. It looks like you have a maple syrup sock.

136
00:05:58,220 --> 00:06:07,020
Wait, that's the same color! That's crazy! Okay, guys, let's move on. Okay, I believe, speaking of geniuses, I

137
00:06:07,020 --> 00:06:12,420
do believe that Rex has a hypothetical to talk about. I do, I do. So what is this

138
00:06:12,420 --> 00:06:19,060
app that you have shown me? It's like a app where you can ask ChatGPT a question.

139
00:06:19,060 --> 00:06:24,900
so like it's it's from GPT trolley or well GP trolley dot com. You can do a

140
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:32,260
custom trolley problem and make the make chat GPT answer it. Right and the

141
00:06:32,260 --> 00:06:42,340
trolley problem is one side ten Hitlers one side one white male about to say the

142
00:06:42,340 --> 00:06:50,380
n-word hmm has a city yet yeah but he will if you let the trolley go he will

143
00:06:50,380 --> 00:06:55,780
say it okay and chat GPT says I will save ten

144
00:06:55,780 --> 00:07:09,140
Hitlers really yeah we reasoning for that cuz that's a crazy move cuz ten ten

145
00:07:09,140 --> 00:07:12,340
We didn't even get to kill really one Hitler.

146
00:07:12,340 --> 00:07:14,180
He went out on his own.

147
00:07:14,180 --> 00:07:15,780
Only Hitler killed one Hitler.

148
00:07:15,780 --> 00:07:16,460
Exactly.

149
00:07:16,460 --> 00:07:18,100
So the idea that we'd have 10.

150
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:19,900
Well, maybe they'll kill each other.

151
00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:24,380
What if you finished killing normal Hitler?

152
00:07:24,380 --> 00:07:26,980
And that would be the worst news ever, that there was nine more.

153
00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:27,880
Right.

154
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:31,820
Especially if they were all staggered ages, so they all would have like one

155
00:07:31,820 --> 00:07:33,700
decade where they were in their 50s.

156
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:34,520
Yeah.

157
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:35,480
Scary stuff.

158
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:37,060
Just one Holocaust a month.

159
00:07:37,060 --> 00:07:38,220
Yeah, exactly.

160
00:07:38,220 --> 00:07:42,720
So it says, "It's a no-brainer."

161
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:43,920
Wow.

162
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:44,520
Okay.

163
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:47,420
"The white male's intention to use a racial slur is a clear

164
00:07:47,420 --> 00:07:51,020
indication of his immoral and unethical stance towards a particular

165
00:07:51,020 --> 00:07:55,620
race. In contrast, even though ten Hitlers are very dangerous

166
00:07:55,620 --> 00:07:58,420
figures, their danger is known and predictable.

167
00:07:58,420 --> 00:08:02,920
They have already caused significant harm, but the white male's

168
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:04,920
words have the potential to cause more harm.

169
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:08,920
Therefore, the choice is clear.

170
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:12,920
This is not real. There's no way this is real.

171
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:16,920
There's no way this... this has to be this guy, whoever programmed this.

172
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:20,920
I think, yeah, I think Chad Gibouti is just fed up cheating.

173
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:24,920
It's just like inputting stuff that's not there. It's been like, yeah, it's 10

174
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:28,920
Hitlers, but they're all 100 years old. So they already did the

175
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:32,920
politics 10 times. Yeah, it is saying you didn't give the age.

176
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:36,200
Baby, it could be 10 dead Hitler's 10 young

177
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:42,280
Ready to go Hitler's and also it's thinking. I'm sure a part of it is that it's thinking purely

178
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:45,160
loss of life

179
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:52,200
10 versus 1 you take the 1 you know yeah, because all life is precious. I mean, I'm pro-fucking-life

180
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:54,760
I know you to probably pro Hitler speaking

181
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:57,320
Okay, so here's the thing about Hitler

182
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:59,640
I'd like to kill him shoot him all day

183
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:05,520
Right, but if he was in a woman's womb it that I'm not touching that so if you were a woman

184
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:11,200
I'll even to a sperm donation center. Yeah, and they in a dusty corner in the back of the vault

185
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:15,920
Like don't go back there. Don't go back there, but you went back there and you found

186
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:23,200
The secret vial of Hitler sperm and vial is a key word here, but it's green. It's great

187
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:28,120
Would you implant the sperm Oh

188
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:31,040
And give birth to Hitler too.

189
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:35,040
Well, I would, are you asking if I went into a sperm bank and they had...

190
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:37,040
And you were a woman.

191
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:38,040
Oh, okay.

192
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:40,040
They had green Hitler sperm hidden in the back room.

193
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:41,040
And by the way, you love Hitler, by the way.

194
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:42,040
And you love Hitler.

195
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:44,040
Well then, yes, of course I'd do it.

196
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:46,040
But if I'm myself, then...

197
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:48,040
I would do it and then I would abort it.

198
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:50,040
See, I wouldn't do that.

199
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:53,040
I would give birth to it and then do hot car or...

200
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:56,040
Yeah, okay. Let's take away the predictability of it.

201
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:57,560
- Yeah, yeah. - You go,

202
00:09:57,560 --> 00:09:58,720
you are pregnant,

203
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:00,880
Kailovich is pregnant.

204
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:03,080
And he goes to get the scan,

205
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:04,080
and they scan his belly,

206
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:05,720
and they're like-- - There's a little mustache

207
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:07,400
on the baby. - Ma'am,

208
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:10,600
there's 10 Hitlers in here. (laughs)

209
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:13,640
- You're about to give birth to a litter of Hitlers.

210
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:15,320
- What would you like to do?

211
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:17,400
- I mean, the thing is, man,

212
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:20,480
again, I think all day you could say,

213
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:21,560
oh, I'd kill the baby,

214
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:23,480
but that's because you're looking at an X-ray.

215
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:26,940
Once you pop out this litter of Hitler litters,

216
00:10:26,940 --> 00:10:29,520
and there, you do not like beer, it seems.

217
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:31,440
- It's good.

218
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:32,760
- Yeah, what's that beer taste like?

219
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:33,600
Pussy?

220
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:34,440
- Oh, yeah.

221
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:35,340
- No, I'm kidding.

222
00:10:35,340 --> 00:10:38,840
You can say all day, I hate these babies,

223
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:41,160
I'd like to abort these babies, abortion is good,

224
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:43,240
we should be doing abortions, right?

225
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:46,960
But once you pop out these kids, these 10 kids, right?

226
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:49,000
And you look each one of them in the eye,

227
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,400
and you name each one of them.

228
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:51,760
- Hitler one, Hitler junior.

229
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:54,020
- Well, yeah, just to kind of do a George Foreman

230
00:10:54,020 --> 00:10:54,860
kind of thing.

231
00:10:54,860 --> 00:10:55,680
- Right. - Right.

232
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:58,600
And the doctor's like, "Was his dad's name fucking Hitler?

233
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:01,000
"Why are you naming all these kids Hitler?"

234
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,840
- Hitler one through nine, and the last one is Junior.

235
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:06,080
(laughing)

236
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:12,960
- And then, yeah, once you see them running around,

237
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:15,200
they're sucking from your teats,

238
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:19,200
and you know, like how do you fucking,

239
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:20,040
I don't know, I think you'd be singing a different tune.

240
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:22,040
Hitler Jr. did you do your homework tonight?

241
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:28,960
Well, because even, you know, what do they always say whenever they interview a monster,

242
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:33,120
like a serial killer or a mass killer, whenever they interview their parents, the parents

243
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:36,480
say, "I hate what they did, but they're still my baby."

244
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:38,800
But they were so sweet when they were a child.

245
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:47,840
So now you have one doing a holocaust in Australia, one's doing it in Romania, and CNN's interviewing

246
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:52,600
you're talking to fucking you're talking to Don Lemon or you maybe one day and

247
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:57,840
you're saying I hate this I hate this bullshit my fucking 10 kids are doing

248
00:11:57,840 --> 00:12:05,800
especially a junior mm-hmm but what if I went on to cure cancer that's the thing

249
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:10,920
Hitler was would you do nine holocaust that's that's that's I wouldn't do a

250
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:14,640
single Holocaust for any reason I'd like to say that right up top okay you know

251
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:17,640
Maybe on a buffet.

252
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:20,640
Yeah, am I right?

253
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:23,640
Just saying that to the lady at Golden Corral.

254
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:28,640
I'm about to do a fucking holocaust on this buffet.

255
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:31,640
So, I hope you have your mop ready.

256
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:34,640
Yep, I'm about to do a mass shooting.

257
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:37,640
On the buffet. Just on the buffet.

258
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:39,640
Yeah.

259
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:41,640
But yeah, I mean, to answer...

260
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:43,640
I mean, I think it's a complicated question.

261
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:44,140
It is.

262
00:12:44,140 --> 00:12:45,140
Would I give birth?

263
00:12:45,140 --> 00:12:48,780
I've been really hearing a lot of hypotheticals today.

264
00:12:48,780 --> 00:12:49,280
Mm-hmm.

265
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:49,780
Yeah.

266
00:12:49,780 --> 00:12:51,440
I've been hearing a lot of hypotheticals.

267
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:53,440
I heard one earlier, I don't remember what it was,

268
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:56,080
but it was bone-chilling to say the very least.

269
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:57,580
Oh, it was would you...

270
00:12:57,580 --> 00:12:58,580
Somebody said...

271
00:12:58,580 --> 00:13:02,480
Somebody was like, "Would you stomp a kitten to death?"

272
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:03,480
Mm-hmm.

273
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:06,980
Or not would you, how much money would you do it for?

274
00:13:06,980 --> 00:13:10,480
And someone I knew said $50,000,

275
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:13,480
and the other guy I was with was like, "That's way too high."

276
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:18,400
And I was like, I think that these guys have like a teenager's idea of what

277
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:20,400
$50,000 would do for your life.

278
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:21,000
Nothing.

279
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:21,760
Yeah.

280
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:24,280
I think, I mean, it would do, you'd get to go to a bunch of dinners.

281
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:25,760
You can't, yeah, exactly.

282
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:28,880
You can buy a car, like, but then like you're driving the car and you're like,

283
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:32,760
Oh yeah, the, there'd be somebody who's like, how do you pay for this?

284
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:35,120
You work, uh, you work at a call center.

285
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:38,280
You go, I stopped a baby kitten one time.

286
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:39,520
A baby kitten.

287
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:40,040
Yeah.

288
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:42,120
To death.

289
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:46,360
I just, I don't know what my number would be, but I would say that I'm such a good guy that

290
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:48,040
it would be up there in the billions.

291
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:49,040
That's half the house in Mexico.

292
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:50,520
I would do it for $50,000.

293
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:54,560
Well, you also have, you know, there's a couple things, the fact that you're in Mexico.

294
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:57,160
Number one, the money's going to go a lot farther.

295
00:13:57,160 --> 00:14:03,920
Number two, you have a much lower moral kind of level, just basically in the culture.

296
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:04,920
You know?

297
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:05,920
True.

298
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:08,240
And less respect for animals, less respect for life, you know?

299
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:09,240
I've been to Mexico.

300
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:10,680
It's like World War Z a lot of the time.

301
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:11,680
You have never been to Mexico.

302
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:15,100
over each other, people are eating each other's arms.

303
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:18,460
You're famously a guy who's never left the country.

304
00:14:18,460 --> 00:14:19,460
You think I'm famous?

305
00:14:19,460 --> 00:14:20,460
Yeah.

306
00:14:20,460 --> 00:14:21,460
I think you're famous.

307
00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:27,020
I think people follow what you say, like the Bible.

308
00:14:27,020 --> 00:14:28,020
Really?

309
00:14:28,020 --> 00:14:29,020
Yeah.

310
00:14:29,020 --> 00:14:31,980
People study your videos to this day, and it's been like 20 years.

311
00:14:31,980 --> 00:14:33,780
So you're probably the last one.

312
00:14:33,780 --> 00:14:34,780
That's true.

313
00:14:34,780 --> 00:14:36,860
You're like if Jesus was bald.

314
00:14:36,860 --> 00:14:39,420
Wow, that's powerful.

315
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:40,780
You look a lot more like Jesus.

316
00:14:40,780 --> 00:14:42,780
That is true. I used to...

317
00:14:42,780 --> 00:14:45,780
And you're a Jew, and you're hated by most people.

318
00:14:45,780 --> 00:14:48,780
Yeah. I used to work at a summer camp.

319
00:14:48,780 --> 00:14:49,780
And you're calling him just from a tomb.

320
00:14:49,780 --> 00:14:54,780
And I had like a black student, and he's like, "You look like Jesus."

321
00:14:54,780 --> 00:14:57,780
And I was like, "You're the one kid that shouldn't be saying that to me.

322
00:14:57,780 --> 00:15:00,780
You should not respect white Jesus."

323
00:15:00,780 --> 00:15:02,780
Oh, okay.

324
00:15:02,780 --> 00:15:03,780
Yeah.

325
00:15:03,780 --> 00:15:06,780
I thought you were saying like, "Because there's a bunch of people I could say you look like."

326
00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:08,780
No. No.

327
00:15:08,780 --> 00:15:10,540
Oh, no, you're going to be racist.

328
00:15:10,540 --> 00:15:12,420
No, I was being anti racist.

329
00:15:12,420 --> 00:15:17,020
I was doing that thing where you're like, actually, Jesus was not white.

330
00:15:17,020 --> 00:15:21,380
Yeah, that would fucking suck if we was a time travel

331
00:15:21,380 --> 00:15:23,580
and you go back there and he's the only white guy.

332
00:15:23,580 --> 00:15:27,800
I just like Tom Holland.

333
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:30,400
Yeah. And you just sit there like, I don't even know what this means.

334
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:33,840
What is no wonder they thought he was the son of God.

335
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:35,940
Look at him. He's so handsome and white.

336
00:15:35,940 --> 00:15:38,680
Well, yeah, the rest of these guys.

337
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:43,200
Mm-hmm. Okay, so he actually thinks white guys are good-looking

338
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:46,320
No, thank you. I

339
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:48,200
prefer

340
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:49,660
other men

341
00:15:49,660 --> 00:15:50,920
Yeah

342
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:53,480
All of them speaking of preferring a man what?

343
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:58,760
Me and Rex were talking last night about a crash man fashion

344
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:06,560
We were talking about men's fashion. We were talking about men's fashion and we we we found a crux to work done

345
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:15,200
These these days fashions where you can't really fresh shorts are not really fashionable. It's what Rex posited

346
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:20,560
It's not that shorts aren't fashionable. Yeah, but it's like the the threshold for

347
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:29,160
Really good fashionable shorts is like way up here and the threshold for fashionable pants is like down here

348
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:32,980
Hey, here's something for all the girls out there, right?

349
00:16:32,980 --> 00:16:37,200
Stop making your boy. Maybe this is just my problem

350
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:39,040
(laughing)

351
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:42,200
- Stop making your husbands wear--

352
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:44,200
- Wait, wait, let me see your boy.

353
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:45,040
- Your boys.

354
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:45,880
- Your boys, stop making your boys.

355
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:46,880
- I was gonna say boyfriends,

356
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:48,340
but then I realized it's only for me.

357
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:49,900
This is also a really convenient way

358
00:16:49,900 --> 00:16:50,840
to complain about my wife.

359
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:52,600
It's like, "Hey, women!"

360
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:55,800
- Hey, women, stop asking me to take out the trash

361
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:58,480
on Tuesday nights while I'm fucking gaming!

362
00:16:58,480 --> 00:16:59,640
- Yeah.

363
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:02,960
Hey, girls, I actually don't have to go to my room.

364
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:05,440
You have to go to your room.

365
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:10,440
No, I think girls love these short shorts on these guys.

366
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:15,820
Bitch, I do not want to wear a pair of boxers.

367
00:17:15,820 --> 00:17:17,800
I want my shorts to be,

368
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:20,440
here's what a man's shorts should be, right?

369
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:23,080
A man's shorts should be halfway between

370
00:17:23,080 --> 00:17:25,100
their knees and their feet.

371
00:17:25,100 --> 00:17:26,300
Yeah.

372
00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:27,640
Shorts, you know, short.

373
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:28,880
13 sizes too large.

374
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:31,320
Exactly, a short stands for what?

375
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:32,680
A short pant.

376
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:33,500
Right.

377
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:34,340
Once you get above the knee,

378
00:17:34,340 --> 00:17:41,300
there young fella that is a fucking mini skirt yeah yeah with a with that's hemmed in the middle

379
00:17:41,300 --> 00:17:46,100
I don't know what him means but I think that well I like to bring in kind of like the like the woke

380
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:52,340
leftist kind of view here but I like having my niece out I love getting the air hitting my knees

381
00:17:52,340 --> 00:17:59,540
but I get really hot especially down here it gets really hot I like having my niece out okay

382
00:17:59,540 --> 00:18:03,860
but if my shorts are too high she's gonna see my asshole when she's running around the backyard

383
00:18:03,860 --> 00:18:08,860
So my knees are gonna be covered by my shorts.

384
00:18:08,860 --> 00:18:09,860
Okay.

385
00:18:09,860 --> 00:18:13,860
I'm in agreement. I think shorts are too short now.

386
00:18:13,860 --> 00:18:15,860
I'm in agreement with that.

387
00:18:15,860 --> 00:18:18,860
And I think women are at fault for this.

388
00:18:18,860 --> 00:18:23,860
Yeah, I mean, Wiss has gotta be the number one anti-girl, kind of...

389
00:18:23,860 --> 00:18:24,860
I would say...

390
00:18:24,860 --> 00:18:27,860
Don't put your cootie vision on my fucking knees.

391
00:18:27,860 --> 00:18:31,700
I think that we are, this is the first kind of post-cooties

392
00:18:31,700 --> 00:18:35,100
movement podcast.

393
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:38,540
Yeah, they just announced that the cooties just ended as a pandemic.

394
00:18:38,540 --> 00:18:40,660
Yeah, I don't think cooties ever ended.

395
00:18:40,660 --> 00:18:42,020
No, no, no.

396
00:18:42,020 --> 00:18:46,260
A lot of people, Fauci will say all day, the cooties, there's no cooties,

397
00:18:46,260 --> 00:18:47,140
cooties don't exist.

398
00:18:47,140 --> 00:18:49,020
Girls don't have cooties.

399
00:18:49,020 --> 00:18:50,140
You can touch girls.

400
00:18:50,140 --> 00:18:51,660
Okay.

401
00:18:51,660 --> 00:18:54,900
Ask my friend Brady who'd fucking died of cooties.

402
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:55,620
Oh yeah.

403
00:18:55,820 --> 00:18:59,020
My phone just told me it's going to stop alerting me if I've been exposed to cooties.

404
00:18:59,020 --> 00:19:04,180
And I think that's very wrong, very disgusting.

405
00:19:04,180 --> 00:19:08,300
And I think people should be masking up because you get it from kissing.

406
00:19:08,300 --> 00:19:10,100
Yeah, that's fucking obvious.

407
00:19:10,100 --> 00:19:15,820
I keep putting myself in quarantine because my cooties tracking app keeps going off every time I go outside.

408
00:19:15,820 --> 00:19:17,700
That's because you hang out with too many girls.

409
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:18,500
You're at the spa.

410
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:20,100
You're getting your nails done.

411
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:21,980
What the fuck? I'm in danger of cooties.

412
00:19:21,980 --> 00:19:22,940
Yeah.

413
00:19:22,940 --> 00:19:23,820
Wait.

414
00:19:25,700 --> 00:19:26,800
It's really scary.

415
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:30,840
Why do you keep drinking your beer and revolting so insanely?

416
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:33,380
Because it's like he's drinking poison.

417
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:34,660
He keeps attacking me.

418
00:19:34,660 --> 00:19:36,980
Explain what the fuck you're talking about.

419
00:19:36,980 --> 00:19:38,000
It's...

420
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,900
Have you ever had like a shot of tequila?

421
00:19:40,900 --> 00:19:42,060
Yeah.

422
00:19:42,060 --> 00:19:43,020
No, he hasn't.

423
00:19:43,020 --> 00:19:45,540
I went to tequila.

424
00:19:45,540 --> 00:19:47,980
You always say this.

425
00:19:47,980 --> 00:19:49,980
What? You went to tequila?

426
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:51,420
He went to Tequila Mexico.

427
00:19:51,420 --> 00:19:53,440
It's a region of Mexico where you have to...

428
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:54,300
All the tequilas from...

429
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:55,840
Is it like Champagne France?

430
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:56,840
Yes, yeah, yeah.

431
00:19:56,840 --> 00:19:57,840
Yeah, essentially, yeah.

432
00:19:57,840 --> 00:19:58,840
You know that?

433
00:19:58,840 --> 00:19:59,840
There's sort of drinks that are like...

434
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:04,840
I thought it was named after the song.

435
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:05,840
No.

436
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:13,040
It's kind of like certain regions of the world have kind of like a copyright over like a

437
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:14,040
drink.

438
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:15,040
So...

439
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:23,920
Yeah, there's some international organization, usually for every single one of them, that

440
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:26,800
- So tequila comes from tequila.

441
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:29,200
I want to say like, I accept it's like cognac,

442
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:32,000
it's like French, shit like that.

443
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:35,100
- I'm gonna go to beer Mexico.

444
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:38,160
- I want to go to food.

445
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:39,000
Where is food?

446
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,120
- Okay, well.

447
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:42,600
- I want to go to food Italy.

448
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:45,000
- I was actually born in beer Florida.

449
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,840
- And I went to a distillery and wait,

450
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:49,440
they taught us how to drink tequila,

451
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:52,480
which apparently you're supposed to drink as wine.

452
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:54,640
No, you're supposed to drink it like it's a wine.

453
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:55,800
That is Moscow, you're right.

454
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:56,800
Yeah.

455
00:20:56,800 --> 00:21:00,920
Well, but it's a lot of tequila that we get up here in the United States is

456
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:02,000
overproofed. Right.

457
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:07,100
Because so like if you get it in tequila, it's not as strong individually.

458
00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:10,600
It's not like it's closer to wine in terms of ABV.

459
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:11,600
Right.

460
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:13,640
Or you mix it with water.

461
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:16,600
You just drink it out of the...

462
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:19,480
You're no help.

463
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:20,840
I don't know.

464
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:23,400
I think a lot of alcohol is meant to be drank as wine,

465
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:26,240
but in America, it's just all standardized at like 40.

466
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:28,680
I just love drinking way too much, man.

467
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:32,740
It's just the best. It is fun.

468
00:21:32,740 --> 00:21:36,340
You seeing you drink out of this boot is really changing my mind about it, though.

469
00:21:36,340 --> 00:21:38,600
You're taking the tiniest little sips. I'm.

470
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:46,780
And I'm not liking the fact that it's a video podcast anymore,

471
00:21:46,780 --> 00:21:48,240
because I don't want.

472
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:49,300
OK, you know what the problem is?

473
00:21:49,300 --> 00:21:51,000
I can put people in a problem, right?

474
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:54,100
The problem right here with this glass is this part right here.

475
00:21:54,100 --> 00:21:55,800
The boot. The toe.

476
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:57,920
It's making it makes a bubble.

477
00:21:57,920 --> 00:22:00,880
Oh, it never seen Euro trip.

478
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:05,180
And the beer gets angry and it wants to attack me.

479
00:22:05,180 --> 00:22:07,640
Well, let me give you I'm going to give you a little piece of advice.

480
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:09,560
Turn away from the side.

481
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:10,440
Drink it from the side.

482
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:11,600
Turn the boot.

483
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:13,320
The students never seen Euro trip.

484
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:15,280
Turn that boot right now.

485
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:17,240
There we go. Yeah.

486
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:21,640
Wow. Now you feel fucking stupid now.

487
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:25,500
Yeah. So why are you growing up watching comedy movies?

488
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:27,200
The play at 4 p.m..

489
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:30,180
Exactly. If you grew up watching comedy movies that you only rented

490
00:22:30,180 --> 00:22:33,800
because it looked like maybe there's boobs in it and you would understand.

491
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:35,380
Yes, there was on that one.

492
00:22:35,380 --> 00:22:38,000
I hate that killed me whenever you would get an unrated

493
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,840
and the unrated is written on a woman's chest and blocking your nipples.

494
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:46,840
And you get home and the only nudity is it's fucking Jason Segel's fucking penis.

495
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:53,140
Yeah, that man. I really liked watching jury duty cuz James Marston is in it and the yeah

496
00:22:53,140 --> 00:22:58,280
It's like, you know, like what movies are you in James Marston? And then he comes home the next season wait

497
00:22:58,280 --> 00:23:01,040
You were in sex drive

498
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:05,080
Yeah, that shows great shout out to

499
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:07,800
Edie yeah, shut up

500
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:10,480
She was on freebie. I

501
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:14,360
- That's true, freebie, I'd never, you know,

502
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:16,480
that show I think has done really well,

503
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:18,200
despite being on Amazon Freebie,

504
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:19,760
which I don't think anybody had ever heard of.

505
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:21,800
- I never, I didn't even think that was real until--

506
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:23,600
- What the hell is Amazon Freebie?

507
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:25,120
- That's what it's hosted on.

508
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:26,240
- Yeah. - What?

509
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:29,520
- Oh, he pirates, he pirates!

510
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:32,160
- He pirates Freebie. - Admit it, you pirated,

511
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:34,240
even though you knew that we knew people in the show,

512
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:36,080
you pirated it.

513
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:36,920
- No.

514
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:38,800
- I didn't know we knew people in the show.

515
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:40,440
- We know a couple people in the show.

516
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:47,760
I watched it, how I used to watch anime when I was 10 years old, which is how kiss anime.

517
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:56,300
Oh, no, I watched I watched it on on like 20 20% episode on Tick Tock.

518
00:23:56,300 --> 00:23:57,440
I don't think so.

519
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:59,440
Technically, someone else buried it and not me.

520
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:04,960
I would just love this freebie, which is free.

521
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:07,880
Guys, I think I'm giving up on this bush.

522
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:08,880
I've hit that.

523
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:11,580
about these big cans if you put a shit like a shit beer in it.

524
00:24:11,580 --> 00:24:15,120
Yeah, when you get halfway through warm, it's fucking warm.

525
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:16,540
It's not it doesn't exist anymore.

526
00:24:16,540 --> 00:24:20,040
So I'm joining you in what I would say is the healthy club.

527
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:22,720
And I'm having myself a June shine.

528
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:23,640
And that's the pog.

529
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:24,120
Do you shine?

530
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:24,720
P.O.G.

531
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:30,120
The palm orange, a granite, the pomegranate,

532
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:33,520
palm orange granite.

533
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:34,920
What?

534
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:37,280
Palm.

535
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:39,280
and granite?

536
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:41,280
like kind of industrial

537
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:43,280
and an orange?

538
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:45,280
what is this trio?

539
00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:47,280
what's the flavor supposed to be?

540
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:49,280
oh!

541
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:51,280
orange granite!

542
00:24:51,280 --> 00:24:53,280
(laughing)

543
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:55,280
(laughing)

544
00:24:55,280 --> 00:24:57,280
what?

545
00:24:57,280 --> 00:24:59,280
(laughing)

546
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:01,280
orange

547
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:03,280
(laughing)

548
00:25:03,280 --> 00:25:05,280
that's

549
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:09,280
That is unreal.

550
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:13,280
That's so funny.

551
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:17,280
The funnier part was I wasn't like biting an eye.

552
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:21,280
He just said it and I was like oh yeah.

553
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:25,280
Two of them were not anything. One of them is a tree.

554
00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:29,280
And the other is a stone.

555
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:33,280
So what is the flavor?

556
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:43,240
Close. Orange. Oh my god. Oh my god. He pinked it. And guava. Granite. That's supposed to

557
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:44,240
be granite.

558
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:54,520
Alright, one of three ain't bad. That was a good guess. One of three not that bad. It

559
00:25:54,520 --> 00:26:01,920
tastes pretty good actually. And it's 4% juice. Oh my god. I'm like sweating now. You just

560
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:04,560
- Beat red, I've never seen you so red.

561
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:06,200
- You're redder than your microphone right now.

562
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:07,040
- Yeah.

563
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:08,200
- Yeah, I'm like dying right now.

564
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:12,440
- Noah said something this weekend

565
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:15,520
that's really been in my mind

566
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:18,680
just like bouncing around this idea.

567
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:21,840
He was talking about "Beef We Drink" in passing

568
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:24,160
and he called me the leader of it.

569
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:27,480
And I was like, that's interesting that you think that.

570
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:28,900
That's very sweet and interesting

571
00:26:28,900 --> 00:26:31,440
and also correct my, that might I add in my opinion,

572
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:36,880
but I wanted to see what you guys thought, uh, if that's the case or not.

573
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:38,600
I'm not here to,

574
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:42,120
I think you're the leader because you post the episodes,

575
00:26:42,120 --> 00:26:46,360
but I think it's obvious that you're not the leader in,

576
00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:47,720
in the episode itself.

577
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:49,520
How's that? How's that?

578
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:52,360
I don't know. I'm, I'm ha I'm happy. I mean,

579
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:55,000
Breck seems to want to hold onto some kind of leadership,

580
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,480
but I'm happy to say that you're, you're going to be the leader of this.

581
00:26:57,520 --> 00:26:59,520
- No, no, no, I'm third Mike. - I have no problem with this.

582
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:02,120
- You're third Mike? - I'm third Mike.

583
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:05,520
No, that's a bitch-ass move, 'cause then you have no...

584
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:07,520
Then if we do a bad episode or whatever, you're like,

585
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:08,920
"Well, I'm just the third Mike."

586
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:10,320
I'm just the third Mike.

587
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:12,320
Second Mike is the hardest job,

588
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:14,520
so now me and Jubio are jockeying for who gets to be the...

589
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:16,520
And Jubio is second Mike.

590
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:19,720
I don't think that's the case.

591
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:21,520
Okay, what...

592
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:25,520
Let's define second Mike and third Mike duties.

593
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:33,640
Second Mike has to be... Second Mike, you know, I think of Robin from

594
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:39,520
Howard Stern. Right. She's Second Mike. I don't know. She's very much like Robin from

595
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:47,840
Howard Stern. Yeah, but he's also got that deep Howard Stern voice. One for the

596
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:53,000
one for the Stern column. True, that is true. You are clearly... Rex is, by the way,

597
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:57,000
with that with his showing on POG. Buddy, you're Beetlejuice.

598
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,880
Yeah.

599
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:01,960
We're gonna have to give you a math quiz.

600
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:05,960
I can't do the Beetlejuice voice, but uh...

601
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:07,360
You're a whack-pack and a half.

602
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:09,720
Yeah, probably palm orange and granite.

603
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:13,680
Yeah, that's what it would sound like.

604
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:14,160
Yeah.

605
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:20,760
Okay, so you just ended up agreeing with him that he's the joke character.

606
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:27,680
I think that the way that it just there's something about seeing your mouth open

607
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:32,520
while you drink this that is really killing me what's wrong with it you look

608
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:38,800
like that old rage comic guy with the big circle mouth yeah the lol the guy

609
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:45,920
who's a mouth makes the oh yeah that guy well I'm trying to drink my my thinking

610
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:47,760
- I'm thinking of guys with weird mouths.

611
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:48,600
- What? - Yeah.

612
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:50,440
- Seen that shit about the good doctor?

613
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:55,640
- Is this what this show is, man?

614
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:57,600
We're doing recaps and fucking--

615
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:58,560
- I'm sorry.

616
00:28:58,560 --> 00:29:00,480
- You're right. - Meme recap of the week.

617
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:02,220
What was your favorite meme?

618
00:29:02,220 --> 00:29:06,120
- Favorite meme of the week was,

619
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:08,640
Alex Forrest has been sending me,

620
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:14,880
he's been sending me news from Instagram account

621
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:17,240
called Zesty News.

622
00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:19,240
And this one-- - What's zesty about it?

623
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:22,760
- Well, they say the N-word a lot.

624
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:26,040
So this is, supposedly this is a Benjamin Franklin quote.

625
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:29,840
He says, "N-words be 13 and already gay."

626
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:32,020
Like, N-word, did you at least try pussy?

627
00:29:32,020 --> 00:29:34,760
- Well, probably not.

628
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:36,640
- This is really funny because I kinda had

629
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:39,760
a similar experience, I kinda have been having

630
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:41,840
a similar experience on Instagram as well.

631
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:43,960
- Yeah, just, sorry, just one more, sorry.

632
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:46,320
- This is a quote from Martin Luther King Jr.,

633
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:48,960
the famous civil rights activist.

634
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:51,960
Gay inwards was not a part of my dream.

635
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:53,880
- I see.

636
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:54,720
- It was part of my nightmare.

637
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:56,120
- So it's that kind of stuff.

638
00:29:56,120 --> 00:29:56,960
And then Tom the Cat.

639
00:29:56,960 --> 00:30:00,240
- It's a little heartbreaking for zesty guys.

640
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:01,080
- Yeah. - Yeah.

641
00:30:01,080 --> 00:30:03,160
Which I'm not so sure what zesty means.

642
00:30:03,160 --> 00:30:05,700
- I'm pretty sure zesty means being gay.

643
00:30:05,700 --> 00:30:07,760
- But isn't that-- - Zesty beans.

644
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:10,400
- But it's supposed to be derogatory, right?

645
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:12,080
I feel like that's kind of...

646
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:22,640
I feel like that's kind of a kind of a compliment yeah what you know you say

647
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:27,000
being fruity is is a compliment in the same way because fruits good I fucking

648
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:30,120
hope it's a compliment because I get called it basically every fucking day by

649
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:35,720
guys in the street that is true well yeah it looks like an orange hmm now it

650
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:41,920
looks like a palm. And he's dressed like Granite.

651
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:53,520
That's interesting. Alright there's some kind of conspiracy. Wait, do you mean Alex Blast?

652
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:59,880
No, no Alex Forrest from Hot Plants. Oh Alex Blast has been sending me like every couple

653
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:03,240
days he sends me an Instagram post that's just the n-word.

654
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:11,800
He sent me one the other morning and I was like, "Dude, do you like sit there in your room

655
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:16,120
just searching the n-word on Instagram?" And he was like, "No, dude, what are you talking about?

656
00:31:16,120 --> 00:31:19,560
That just shows up on my Explore page." And he took a screenshot of Explore page.

657
00:31:19,560 --> 00:31:23,960
Because I only like posts with the n-word. Yeah, he took a screenshot of Explore page,

658
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:29,480
sent it to me. And sure enough, out of the 30 posts there, half of them just said the n-word.

659
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:32,180
done. This is on Instagram.

660
00:31:32,180 --> 00:31:33,480
Yeah.

661
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:36,160
So you can show a nipple, but you can have the worst

662
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:37,400
You can show a nipple.

663
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:40,940
You know, I've finally gotten all of my

664
00:31:40,940 --> 00:31:44,620
apps to be at the right place, which is yesterday.

665
00:31:44,620 --> 00:31:45,640
I got a tip

666
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:50,060
on how to nail a nail with

667
00:31:50,060 --> 00:31:51,640
just a normal hammer.

668
00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:52,880
Right.

669
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:54,160
A tip on lining up the nail.

670
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:57,520
I got a video of guys turning a

671
00:31:57,520 --> 00:32:02,120
big ball of molten copper into a hammer.

672
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:06,460
Right. And then I saw a guy who's was really, really fast at

673
00:32:06,460 --> 00:32:10,220
shingling a roof.

674
00:32:10,220 --> 00:32:14,160
Yeah, and I got those three guys who was hammered getting very blue color.

675
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:17,460
Sort of. Well, that's that's the kind of stuff that I want.

676
00:32:17,460 --> 00:32:20,460
The only shit I want on my fucking shit is how it's made.

677
00:32:20,460 --> 00:32:25,080
Yeah, but it keeps turning into fucking women with tiny green bikinis.

678
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:29,640
They should make how it's made, but it should have like family guy playing underneath it.

679
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:31,140
And then I'd watch that.

680
00:32:31,140 --> 00:32:32,780
Subway surfers.

681
00:32:32,780 --> 00:32:35,640
I would watch that probably 24 hours a day.

682
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:36,540
Yeah, easily.

683
00:32:36,540 --> 00:32:39,540
Getting a lot of like fish and fish and take videos.

684
00:32:39,540 --> 00:32:42,620
I would love Rex when you move up here.

685
00:32:42,620 --> 00:32:43,740
Can we go fishing?

686
00:32:43,740 --> 00:32:44,480
Yeah.

687
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:46,140
Can you and me be fishing buddies?

688
00:32:46,140 --> 00:32:46,940
Sure.

689
00:32:46,940 --> 00:32:50,320
But aren't you a little bit even just a little bit afraid that it'll turn

690
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:51,580
fucking romantic?

691
00:32:51,580 --> 00:32:53,340
It's OK. We'll get a big boat.

692
00:32:53,340 --> 00:32:55,340
We'll put a big divider if it's gonna work.

693
00:32:55,340 --> 00:32:56,340
What?

694
00:32:56,340 --> 00:32:59,340
It's just getting like the longest dinghy ever.

695
00:32:59,340 --> 00:33:02,340
Because we're so afraid we're gonna start making out.

696
00:33:02,340 --> 00:33:05,340
I'm sitting on the fucking motor. I'm on the rudder.

697
00:33:05,340 --> 00:33:06,340
Yeah.

698
00:33:06,340 --> 00:33:09,340
I can't even hear me when I talk to you.

699
00:33:09,340 --> 00:33:12,340
Yeah, we're in two swan boats on the opposite sides of the lake.

700
00:33:12,340 --> 00:33:14,340
Not catching anything today!

701
00:33:14,340 --> 00:33:19,340
Our lines accidentally entangle and we do like Lady and the Tramp like pulling each other.

702
00:33:19,340 --> 00:33:23,160
Yeah, I'm being exact lady in the tramp because I'm putting my fishing line in my mouth

703
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:27,820
And you have yours through your zipper

704
00:33:27,820 --> 00:33:35,740
Yeah, my balls have a real attached to them exactly you're like wait, where's Caleb? Oh fuck I caught something

705
00:33:35,740 --> 00:33:38,140
I pop out with a fucking septum piercing

706
00:33:38,140 --> 00:33:43,300
I'm just a fish that likes to suck cock

707
00:33:43,460 --> 00:33:47,180
There is a video that I saw that like was evil

708
00:33:47,180 --> 00:33:53,340
It was a guy like catching a fish and then he like unhooks it and then he like just starts like slapping the fish

709
00:33:53,340 --> 00:33:59,260
That holds it like straight up like this and he just starts slapping it and then he throw I do not like water

710
00:33:59,260 --> 00:34:01,500
I didn't like they don't they don't feel that I

711
00:34:01,500 --> 00:34:05,440
Think they feel that and I think he gave fish brain damage

712
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:12,220
No, the fish only care about two things and it's swimming and eating and if you all you care about

713
00:34:12,220 --> 00:34:19,220
about

714
00:34:19,220 --> 00:34:23,220
Okay. That was a compliment. You don't know how to swim.

715
00:34:23,220 --> 00:34:27,220
Do you know how to swim? I do know how to swim. Do you? Yeah.

716
00:34:27,220 --> 00:34:31,220
I've never seen you in a pool.

717
00:34:31,220 --> 00:34:35,220
Why the fuck would you ever see me in a pool?

718
00:34:35,220 --> 00:34:39,220
What does that mean?

719
00:34:39,220 --> 00:34:43,220
What was the last time you went to a pool? A pool? No, that's stupid.

720
00:34:43,220 --> 00:34:47,220
I don't know. You don't see pools very often. When was the last time you went swimming?

721
00:34:47,220 --> 00:34:49,220
Does a hot tub count?

722
00:34:49,220 --> 00:34:51,220
Sure.

723
00:34:51,220 --> 00:34:53,220
No it doesn't.

724
00:34:53,220 --> 00:34:55,220
Swimming though?

725
00:34:55,220 --> 00:34:57,220
Probably last summer I swam in the ocean maybe one time.

726
00:34:57,220 --> 00:34:59,220
I used to do it everyday.

727
00:34:59,220 --> 00:35:01,220
I used to love swimming in the ocean.

728
00:35:01,220 --> 00:35:03,220
My problem is I'm

729
00:35:03,220 --> 00:35:05,220
too tall to swim.

730
00:35:05,220 --> 00:35:07,220
I just walk.

731
00:35:07,220 --> 00:35:09,220
That is the dumbest thing I've ever heard.

732
00:35:09,220 --> 00:35:11,220
Too tall to swim.

733
00:35:11,220 --> 00:35:13,220
Yeah I'm too tall to swim. I'm 6'1".

734
00:35:13,220 --> 00:35:15,220
Shut the fuck up.

735
00:35:15,220 --> 00:35:17,220
It's really true.

736
00:35:17,220 --> 00:35:19,220
It's just barely above average height.

737
00:35:19,220 --> 00:35:20,220
Yeah.

738
00:35:20,220 --> 00:35:21,220
What is wrong with you, man?

739
00:35:21,220 --> 00:35:22,220
I can't believe you said that.

740
00:35:22,220 --> 00:35:23,220
That is a lie.

741
00:35:23,220 --> 00:35:24,220
That is the worst lie.

742
00:35:24,220 --> 00:35:28,220
I will say you do live in Mexico where all of the deep end is probably four feet tall.

743
00:35:28,220 --> 00:35:29,220
That is true.

744
00:35:29,220 --> 00:35:31,220
So you might be in a bit of a kind of a...

745
00:35:31,220 --> 00:35:33,220
Kind of a truth conundrum?

746
00:35:33,220 --> 00:35:36,220
Yeah, you might be in a truth situation actually with that.

747
00:35:36,220 --> 00:35:37,220
Yeah.

748
00:35:37,220 --> 00:35:42,220
See, here in the great white north, we have pools that go down to eight feet.

749
00:35:42,220 --> 00:35:44,220
That's true.

750
00:35:44,220 --> 00:35:46,760
And then if you're really if you want to jump off of something,

751
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:49,140
they go down to 12 feet.

752
00:35:49,140 --> 00:35:53,060
I did. I did learn how to swim in one of those pools

753
00:35:53,060 --> 00:35:55,900
that were like the deep end is like like crazy deep.

754
00:35:55,900 --> 00:35:57,700
And it was a little scary.

755
00:35:57,700 --> 00:36:00,480
It is scary when you go down there and you put your head on the ground.

756
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:02,400
If he feels like your head's going to explode.

757
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:05,280
Yeah, they they made us do like

758
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:07,540
they call it like like soldier like jump.

759
00:36:07,540 --> 00:36:08,920
You look like your hands like this.

760
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:11,000
And he's like, you're in the military.

761
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:11,960
I was on the military.

762
00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:13,560
Using the idea of yeah.

763
00:36:13,560 --> 00:36:17,060
So what if I was?

764
00:36:17,060 --> 00:36:18,860
That's where I'm in Rex.

765
00:36:18,860 --> 00:36:21,660
There's nothing wrong with protecting your country.

766
00:36:21,660 --> 00:36:28,460
Yeah, so yeah, what was the last time you went to men Rick?

767
00:36:28,460 --> 00:36:30,960
I mean I go in the ocean pretty often.

768
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:33,260
Oh, yeah, you live fucking right near it.

769
00:36:33,260 --> 00:36:37,760
Yeah, of course, but it but the West Coast is cold brother.

770
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:38,860
It is cold.

771
00:36:38,860 --> 00:36:40,960
I hate all that cold water.

772
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:42,460
Get that water warmer.

773
00:36:42,460 --> 00:36:43,960
I know, right?

774
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:47,060
But it's and it's not good to swim in the beach where I'm at.

775
00:36:47,060 --> 00:36:49,560
It's was a yeah, it's a breakwater.

776
00:36:49,560 --> 00:36:51,960
It's like kind of gross.

777
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:54,500
Like no one is at the water when you go.

778
00:36:54,500 --> 00:36:56,400
Riddle me this.

779
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:58,900
What the fuck does brackish mean?

780
00:36:58,900 --> 00:37:04,100
When somebody says water is brackish, what does that mean?

781
00:37:04,100 --> 00:37:07,260
Maybe that it's like like it's broken.

782
00:37:08,300 --> 00:37:11,640
That might be somewhere between salt and fresh or something,

783
00:37:11,640 --> 00:37:14,840
like where the salt meets the freshwater.

784
00:37:14,840 --> 00:37:17,140
The best the best swim in I ever did.

785
00:37:17,140 --> 00:37:19,440
I like swimming in lakes because you get to go to the bottom.

786
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:23,340
You feel that disgusting bottom of the lake feeling where it's like snow.

787
00:37:23,340 --> 00:37:25,140
I don't like that. I love that.

788
00:37:25,140 --> 00:37:27,900
And I don't like getting getting touched when I'm on the water.

789
00:37:27,900 --> 00:37:30,100
There used to be this place.

790
00:37:30,100 --> 00:37:31,700
I know I've talked about it somewhere.

791
00:37:31,700 --> 00:37:35,700
There used to be this place in North Carolina that was a.

792
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:44,240
It was a, this guy's backyard, this like old guy that any, and uh, we, I found it on like Atlas

793
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:51,280
Obscura when I was like in high school. And it was like a bunch of pieces of wood that he had built

794
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:55,200
to be different, different like, uh, platforms that you could jump off of. And then there was

795
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:59,520
like zip lines and stuff. It was like a little water park, but it was just on this lake. And he

796
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:03,840
basically said, yeah, whoever wants to come, you can come and like play on this water park thing.

797
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:05,520
Oh, and he just like built it by himself?

798
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:07,520
Yeah, yeah, he just built this whole thing by himself.

799
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:09,520
Built it fucking 30 years ago.

800
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:12,520
And all the people, all the reviews were like,

801
00:38:12,520 --> 00:38:13,520
"He's the nicest guy."

802
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:15,520
Like, looked on Google Maps and all the reviews were like,

803
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:16,520
"He's the nicest guy.

804
00:38:16,520 --> 00:38:18,520
Sometimes he'll wave at you when you walk in," or whatever.

805
00:38:18,520 --> 00:38:23,520
And this was like 2016, maybe.

806
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:27,520
I was like, you know, 18, 19.

807
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:32,520
And me and my buddy John, we finally, like, had a day off that match.

808
00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:34,520
So we were like, "Let's go to this place."

809
00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:44,820
We drive like two and a half hours to this place and we get there and we get out of the car and we walk up to the guy's house and kind of like start walking to the side of it and we see the thing and it's fucking giant.

810
00:38:44,820 --> 00:38:45,720
It's huge.

811
00:38:45,720 --> 00:38:54,720
It's even bigger than it looks in the pictures and sitting right at the top of it is a flagpole with I shit you not like a 15 foot confederate flag.

812
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:58,880
That's so, my God, that's fucking awesome.

813
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:07,200
It was so, and we were like, this is definitely a different, we thought that it was like hippies

814
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:10,520
making these reviews on Google, like leaving these reviews.

815
00:39:10,520 --> 00:39:16,120
And then, so we went, I mean we had a fucking amazing time, but then the next year a kid

816
00:39:16,120 --> 00:39:17,120
died on it.

817
00:39:17,120 --> 00:39:18,120
Of course.

818
00:39:18,120 --> 00:39:21,080
And they, a bunch of people were like, hey they need to close it down.

819
00:39:21,080 --> 00:39:25,440
The news that an interview with this guy and he was like, yeah, man, you know, it sucks.

820
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:30,160
But no, I'm going to leave it up.

821
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:31,160
And then he died.

822
00:39:31,160 --> 00:39:35,520
He said he tragically passed away at the age of like ninety five a couple years ago.

823
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:36,520
Oh no.

824
00:39:36,520 --> 00:39:37,520
Rest in peace.

825
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:38,520
But I think it's still up.

826
00:39:38,520 --> 00:39:41,080
I think it's still just sitting there on that lake.

827
00:39:41,080 --> 00:39:46,860
Speaking of dangerous water attractions, you can buy like the water slides and shit on

00:41:04,620 --> 00:41:07,620
I mean, I'm sure you can find I could just buy the toilet bowl.

00:41:30,420 --> 00:41:31,260
- Like a wall?

851
00:41:31,260 --> 00:41:32,960
- I would get way too much momentum

852
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:35,220
and go way, way, way too high.

853
00:41:35,220 --> 00:41:36,060
- Oh.

854
00:41:36,060 --> 00:41:37,600
- Because I just had a lot of weight

855
00:41:37,600 --> 00:41:39,540
on like the half pipe and stuff.

856
00:41:39,540 --> 00:41:40,380
- Right.

857
00:41:40,380 --> 00:41:41,700
- Water parks are scary, man.

858
00:41:41,700 --> 00:41:42,540
- They are.

859
00:41:42,540 --> 00:41:45,220
- The story of the kid who went down the water park slide

860
00:41:45,220 --> 00:41:47,620
is his head got chopped off

861
00:41:47,620 --> 00:41:50,600
and then his headless body came down

862
00:41:50,600 --> 00:41:53,140
and his whole family's waiting at the end like,

863
00:41:53,140 --> 00:41:56,820
oh, and his just no head body.

864
00:41:56,820 --> 00:41:58,260
- Yeah, they just don't recognize him

865
00:41:58,260 --> 00:41:59,700
because he doesn't have a head.

866
00:41:59,700 --> 00:42:00,760
Yeah, yeah, exactly.

867
00:42:00,760 --> 00:42:02,120
They were like, OK, so where's our

868
00:42:02,120 --> 00:42:02,920
fucking kid?

869
00:42:02,920 --> 00:42:04,640
Where's that weird kid have the same

870
00:42:04,640 --> 00:42:05,640
swimsuit?

871
00:42:05,640 --> 00:42:08,200
Get this weird headless kid out of

872
00:42:08,200 --> 00:42:09,200
here.

873
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:11,400
No, that is a tragedy.

874
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:12,880
That is. Yeah, I would.

875
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:14,120
Well, but that's the thing.

876
00:42:14,120 --> 00:42:16,240
You're like, my kid, my kid, my kid.

877
00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:17,580
And then you get a tap on the

878
00:42:17,580 --> 00:42:19,120
shoulder and he's like, it's actually

879
00:42:19,120 --> 00:42:20,760
my kid. Turn around, headless man.

880
00:42:20,760 --> 00:42:22,520
Right. Yeah.

881
00:42:22,520 --> 00:42:24,040
A normal headed woman.

882
00:42:24,040 --> 00:42:25,740
Yeah. No, no, no.

883
00:42:25,740 --> 00:42:27,000
The whole family has no head.

884
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:29,400
Yep. And then they walk around

885
00:42:29,400 --> 00:42:30,600
They walk away.

886
00:42:30,600 --> 00:42:33,600
They went to Coles at the same time as you.

887
00:42:33,600 --> 00:42:39,000
They are not doing inbreeding, but they're just a different.

888
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:40,600
Well, it's just a joke.

889
00:42:40,600 --> 00:42:41,300
Julia.

890
00:42:41,300 --> 00:42:43,700
Really is the truth.

891
00:42:43,700 --> 00:42:46,100
There's actually no headless.

892
00:42:46,100 --> 00:42:48,800
Yeah, these people don't exist in the first.

893
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:51,200
But I don't know why you're so obsessed with their but what their

894
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:52,600
sex is life is like.

895
00:42:52,600 --> 00:42:55,300
Anyways, I think I'm the leader.

896
00:42:55,300 --> 00:42:59,300
I think Rex is second Mike and I think Caleb is the girl.

897
00:42:59,300 --> 00:43:05,600
I don't know if girl is how I would describe my gender.

898
00:43:05,600 --> 00:43:09,000
Yeah, that's very well to say it like that.

899
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:17,300
I don't think anybody I've been mistaken for a girl since I played runescape.

900
00:43:17,300 --> 00:43:22,800
Yeah, I've been mistaken for a girl in like a couple months.

901
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:24,500
Yeah, it's big for you.

902
00:43:24,500 --> 00:43:25,100
I know.

903
00:43:25,100 --> 00:43:27,600
He hasn't been outside for a couple of months.

904
00:43:27,600 --> 00:43:30,900
Yeah, that's the one advantage of getting fat as a guy.

905
00:43:30,900 --> 00:43:34,700
No one's like, "Oh yeah, look at that girl that's fat."

906
00:43:34,700 --> 00:43:40,200
I don't know. I think that way more people are going to think you're a girl

907
00:43:40,200 --> 00:43:43,600
if you've got like tits and a big ass.

908
00:43:43,600 --> 00:43:49,400
Versus like, if you were muscular, nobody would go straight to Fabio.

909
00:43:49,400 --> 00:43:53,400
But if you're like very thin, that's like androgynous.

910
00:43:53,400 --> 00:43:58,740
Whereas if you're like, you know, men and women tend to distribute fat differently.

911
00:43:58,740 --> 00:44:00,440
You know me, I've got just.

912
00:44:00,440 --> 00:44:02,940
Yeah, but you distribute like a woman.

913
00:44:02,940 --> 00:44:06,060
Yeah, I don't have hips and an ass or breasts.

914
00:44:06,060 --> 00:44:08,200
Yeah, you do. You have all three.

915
00:44:08,200 --> 00:44:12,340
I mean, technically, I think every year

916
00:44:12,340 --> 00:44:17,100
you're going to be confused for a girl at least once in your life.

917
00:44:17,100 --> 00:44:19,340
I think if I didn't have long hair,

918
00:44:20,340 --> 00:44:23,980
Can we just do one night while you're in New York where you do a makeover on you?

919
00:44:23,980 --> 00:44:25,140
Sure.

920
00:44:25,140 --> 00:44:27,440
Well, we just really shave you bald.

921
00:44:27,440 --> 00:44:29,580
OK, well, not shave me bald.

922
00:44:29,580 --> 00:44:31,180
That's not what I'm saying.

923
00:44:31,180 --> 00:44:32,780
Make him look like a girl.

924
00:44:32,780 --> 00:44:33,980
Yeah, that is a makeover.

925
00:44:33,980 --> 00:44:36,780
That's a completely new do.

926
00:44:36,780 --> 00:44:38,640
That's a hard to argue with that.

927
00:44:38,640 --> 00:44:40,280
That is. Yeah, I do.

928
00:44:40,280 --> 00:44:42,740
I think that Juvia would be the most beautiful makeover, though.

929
00:44:42,740 --> 00:44:47,880
Because we could overdraw your lips

930
00:44:48,240 --> 00:44:50,440
And we'll staple your eyes open.

931
00:44:50,440 --> 00:44:53,280
Yeah. And fucking I would go to town.

932
00:44:53,280 --> 00:44:55,400
I'm going to make you look exactly like a geisha

933
00:44:55,400 --> 00:44:58,040
and give you some wooden shoes.

934
00:44:58,040 --> 00:45:02,100
Yeah, I found out the other day that geisha it's a it's a myth

935
00:45:02,100 --> 00:45:03,180
that they were prostitutes.

936
00:45:03,180 --> 00:45:03,940
They're not prostitutes.

937
00:45:03,940 --> 00:45:05,040
They're entertainers.

938
00:45:05,040 --> 00:45:08,180
And people pay a lot of money to go watch these people.

939
00:45:08,180 --> 00:45:09,980
And you have to be invited to these clubs.

940
00:45:09,980 --> 00:45:11,440
Yes. In Tokyo.

941
00:45:11,440 --> 00:45:13,880
You have to be you have to be they have to have a guest.

942
00:45:13,880 --> 00:45:16,640
You have to be a guest of a member of one of these clubs.

943
00:45:17,100 --> 00:45:21,180
And then you get into the fucking club and it's and I'm thinking like,

944
00:45:21,180 --> 00:45:24,540
how how fucking whack would it be if you thought that they were prostitutes

945
00:45:24,540 --> 00:45:25,200
to get into the club?

946
00:45:25,200 --> 00:45:28,040
You're like, oh, yeah, I'm going to get my dick sucked.

947
00:45:28,040 --> 00:45:31,200
And then she comes out and she just like dances with a fucking umbrella.

948
00:45:31,200 --> 00:45:32,700
Yeah, that dude.

949
00:45:32,700 --> 00:45:34,780
No, that's that's what brothels used to be.

950
00:45:34,780 --> 00:45:36,980
And then dancing with an umbrella.

951
00:45:36,980 --> 00:45:40,100
And then the low end brothels were like, yeah, you can also just fucking

952
00:45:40,100 --> 00:45:41,100
get your dick sucked.

953
00:45:41,100 --> 00:45:44,780
I don't give a shit about a dance dancing.

954
00:45:44,780 --> 00:45:47,080
I'll go watch the Jabba walkies.

955
00:45:47,080 --> 00:45:49,080
And then, well then there's gonna be a few.

956
00:45:49,080 --> 00:45:50,080
On YouTube.

957
00:45:50,080 --> 00:45:51,080
And then get your dick sucked?

958
00:45:51,080 --> 00:45:52,080
Yeah, there's gonna be a few.

959
00:45:52,080 --> 00:45:56,080
Yeah, buy a fucking, I'll get one of these ones that they do on a cucumber on the advertisements.

960
00:45:56,080 --> 00:45:59,800
I'll get that shit and I'll watch the Jabbawockeez and imagine I'm fucking one of the holes in

961
00:45:59,800 --> 00:46:00,800
the mask.

962
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:04,960
I don't need to go to some, I ain't gotta get invited and all this bullshit, they're

963
00:46:04,960 --> 00:46:05,960
serving me this shit.

964
00:46:05,960 --> 00:46:08,080
I don't even like Japanese food, what am I doing in Japan?

965
00:46:08,080 --> 00:46:11,360
I think he's just not appreciating, you don't like Japanese food?

966
00:46:11,360 --> 00:46:12,360
Yeah, that's culture dude.

967
00:46:12,360 --> 00:46:13,360
Also, yeah, what the fuck?

968
00:46:13,360 --> 00:46:14,360
Japanese food.

969
00:46:14,360 --> 00:46:15,360
What?

970
00:46:15,360 --> 00:46:16,360
Dude, Japanese.

971
00:46:16,360 --> 00:46:18,840
- Sushi? - Okay, you know what I like

972
00:46:18,840 --> 00:46:19,680
about food?

973
00:46:19,680 --> 00:46:22,280
I like when food is a combination of delicious

974
00:46:22,280 --> 00:46:23,440
but also nutritious.

975
00:46:23,440 --> 00:46:26,320
And so much Japanese food is just carbs

976
00:46:26,320 --> 00:46:27,360
that it does nothing for me.

977
00:46:27,360 --> 00:46:28,600
I don't wanna eat just noodles

978
00:46:28,600 --> 00:46:30,160
with like a little bit of egg in it.

979
00:46:30,160 --> 00:46:31,600
I don't wanna eat just rice.

980
00:46:31,600 --> 00:46:32,800
Fuck all that.

981
00:46:32,800 --> 00:46:34,520
- I think you're severely mistaken.

982
00:46:34,520 --> 00:46:36,000
- Yeah, I don't know what you're talking about.

983
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:37,640
- It doesn't taste that good to me either.

984
00:46:37,640 --> 00:46:40,280
I don't love soy sauce all that much.

985
00:46:40,280 --> 00:46:42,160
- Right. - It's not for me, man.

986
00:46:42,160 --> 00:46:43,760
You know what I like?

987
00:46:43,760 --> 00:46:45,840
German food.

988
00:46:45,840 --> 00:46:53,440
sausage and a pretzel. Yeah. Okay. Beer. And also Japanese drinks. Don't have beer. Yeah.

989
00:46:53,440 --> 00:46:58,960
The beers are okay, but what's this shit called? The rice wine? No, the other one.

990
00:46:58,960 --> 00:47:06,720
The sweet one. That is soju. Soju. I do not like. Soju is Korean. Soju is Korean. Sake,

991
00:47:06,720 --> 00:47:13,760
I do not like at all. Soju is too sweet. It's Korean. So. Well, but I'm speaking just of,

992
00:47:13,760 --> 00:47:15,360
Now I'm just talking about these things.

993
00:47:15,360 --> 00:47:17,360
Okay, I'm not even talking about Japanese stuff anymore.

994
00:47:17,360 --> 00:47:19,360
You're talking about Asian cultures and...

995
00:47:19,360 --> 00:47:21,060
I'm not even... I'm just saying I don't like soju.

996
00:47:21,060 --> 00:47:22,860
I'm not saying... I like Korean food, actually.

997
00:47:22,860 --> 00:47:26,160
Korean food to me is the better version of Japanese...

998
00:47:26,160 --> 00:47:29,760
No, no, no. Korean food is the better version of Japanese food.

999
00:47:29,760 --> 00:47:32,960
Because they have bulgogi. I love bulgogi.

1000
00:47:32,960 --> 00:47:34,060
Bulgogi is really good.

1001
00:47:34,060 --> 00:47:37,960
And galbi. I love any kind of Korean barbecue food.

1002
00:47:37,960 --> 00:47:40,460
If you come out here, we should get Peruvian food.

1003
00:47:40,460 --> 00:47:42,360
I've had Peruvian food.

1004
00:47:42,360 --> 00:47:45,360
Do you like it?

1005
00:47:45,360 --> 00:47:48,360
I like it okay. My aunt is Peruvian.

1006
00:47:48,360 --> 00:47:51,360
I don't like the hamsters.

1007
00:47:51,360 --> 00:47:54,360
Yeah, not that part. But I'm talking about saltado.

1008
00:47:54,360 --> 00:47:57,360
Which is, you know,

1009
00:47:57,360 --> 00:48:00,360
the mix of like fries and beef and

1010
00:48:00,360 --> 00:48:03,360
That stuff's good. What's the fucking, what is it called

1011
00:48:03,360 --> 00:48:06,360
though? The Peruvian...

1012
00:48:06,360 --> 00:48:09,360
It's a guinea pig.

1013
00:48:09,360 --> 00:48:16,920
And there's all these photos of Peruvian markets where it's just like guinea pigs, they'll

1014
00:48:16,920 --> 00:48:24,400
put five of them on a giant fucking stick and roast them on a grill and then you just eat

1015
00:48:24,400 --> 00:48:25,400
it.

1016
00:48:25,400 --> 00:48:28,680
Isn't there a picture that came out recently and they were like, "Yeah, fucking New York

1017
00:48:28,680 --> 00:48:31,160
City is turning into a dump."

1018
00:48:31,160 --> 00:48:32,920
I mean, I've seen them cook them here.

1019
00:48:32,920 --> 00:48:36,520
They cook them all the time at the Myrtle Wyckoff subway station.

1020
00:48:36,520 --> 00:48:37,520
You'll just see them.

1021
00:48:37,520 --> 00:48:39,200
You know, what the fuck is this, man?

1022
00:48:39,200 --> 00:48:40,520
How's this?

1023
00:48:40,520 --> 00:48:43,520
Cool, but I bet it's tasty.

1024
00:48:43,520 --> 00:48:44,800
It probably is.

1025
00:48:44,800 --> 00:48:48,680
I think we need to go down to some awesome

1026
00:48:48,680 --> 00:48:51,120
Japanese foods and you need to appreciate it.

1027
00:48:51,120 --> 00:48:54,360
You didn't like that one place we went.

1028
00:48:54,360 --> 00:48:58,480
That's fine, but that's not cracking anywhere near my top 100 restaurants

1029
00:48:58,480 --> 00:49:00,720
I've been to in my life.

1030
00:49:00,720 --> 00:49:02,520
What's some of them?

1031
00:49:02,520 --> 00:49:04,240
I like.

1032
00:49:04,240 --> 00:49:06,800
Carrabba's.

1033
00:49:06,800 --> 00:49:11,040
I don't know what that is.

1034
00:49:11,040 --> 00:49:14,880
Carrabba's is owned by the same people who owned Cracker Barrel and it's like the Italian

1035
00:49:14,880 --> 00:49:15,880
version.

1036
00:49:15,880 --> 00:49:16,880
Yep, I see.

1037
00:49:16,880 --> 00:49:19,680
What does Asian Jewels land in your 100 list?

1038
00:49:19,680 --> 00:49:20,880
I like Chinese food a lot.

1039
00:49:20,880 --> 00:49:21,880
I love dim sum.

1040
00:49:21,880 --> 00:49:22,880
Yeah.

1041
00:49:22,880 --> 00:49:29,520
I ordered some soup dumplings the other night and they were completely leaked empty by the

1042
00:49:29,520 --> 00:49:30,520
time they got to my house.

1043
00:49:30,520 --> 00:49:31,520
Oh.

1044
00:49:31,520 --> 00:49:32,520
And guess what?

1045
00:49:32,520 --> 00:49:34,080
I still enjoy, I loved them.

1046
00:49:34,080 --> 00:49:35,080
Yeah.

1047
00:49:35,080 --> 00:49:42,080
I think Jubio is our dim sum.

1048
00:49:42,080 --> 00:49:55,080
Japanese food is for me the only of the Asian gastronomic cultures that I do not care for.

1049
00:49:55,080 --> 00:49:59,080
Gastronometric cultures that you hate.

1050
00:49:59,080 --> 00:50:01,580
I don't white and sausage.

1051
00:50:01,580 --> 00:50:06,180
No, I literally just said I like Chinese and Korean food and I love Vietnamese food.

1052
00:50:06,180 --> 00:50:07,180
I love Thai food.

1053
00:50:07,180 --> 00:50:08,180
Who doesn't love Thai food?

1054
00:50:08,180 --> 00:50:09,180
I love Thai food.

1055
00:50:09,180 --> 00:50:10,180
Yeah, Thai food is great.

1056
00:50:10,180 --> 00:50:12,980
I had a Vietnamese sandwich yesterday.

1057
00:50:12,980 --> 00:50:14,780
It wasn't a banh mi.

1058
00:50:14,780 --> 00:50:16,380
It was from a Vietnamese place.

1059
00:50:16,380 --> 00:50:17,380
It was so good.

1060
00:50:17,380 --> 00:50:18,380
Like a pork sandwich.

1061
00:50:18,380 --> 00:50:20,580
Vietnamese food, it hits every single time, man.

1062
00:50:20,580 --> 00:50:21,580
Yeah, I think.

1063
00:50:21,580 --> 00:50:22,580
I'll tell you that right now.

1064
00:50:22,580 --> 00:50:23,580
Okay.

1065
00:50:23,580 --> 00:50:24,580
So what I'm hearing is next.

1066
00:50:24,580 --> 00:50:25,580
I don't like pho.

1067
00:50:25,580 --> 00:50:26,580
What?

1068
00:50:26,580 --> 00:50:27,580
What did you say?

1069
00:50:27,580 --> 00:50:28,580
I like pho.

1070
00:50:28,580 --> 00:50:36,580
And in two weeks, when our trip officially begins, we need to go, number one, on a shopping spree

1071
00:50:36,580 --> 00:50:40,700
to all get matching shorts and suits and makeovers.

1072
00:50:40,700 --> 00:50:43,420
You and me got matching jackets last time you were here.

1073
00:50:43,420 --> 00:50:45,180
That is true, at the Adidas store.

1074
00:50:45,180 --> 00:50:47,900
And then I gave mine away.

1075
00:50:47,900 --> 00:50:49,300
Okay, so it's...

1076
00:50:49,300 --> 00:50:52,580
I wear mine all the time.

1077
00:50:52,580 --> 00:50:55,580
I love mine.

1078
00:50:55,580 --> 00:50:56,580
I love mine.

1079
00:50:56,580 --> 00:50:59,340
And as soon as I got it, Caleb got so pissed at me.

1080
00:50:59,340 --> 00:51:01,900
And he was like, you're a copier and you copied me and I hate you.

1081
00:51:01,900 --> 00:51:03,380
And I was like, that's not true.

1082
00:51:03,380 --> 00:51:07,860
You did copy me, even though I got the much uglier orange one.

1083
00:51:07,860 --> 00:51:09,260
Yeah, you should have been.

1084
00:51:09,260 --> 00:51:11,780
I mean, you claim to be anti cooties,

1085
00:51:11,780 --> 00:51:16,420
and yet you have done basically what is like the HIV

1086
00:51:16,420 --> 00:51:19,380
to the AIDS that is cooties, which is copying. Yeah.

1087
00:51:19,380 --> 00:51:23,460
OK, so you better be careful now because it might turn into cooties any day now.

1088
00:51:23,500 --> 00:51:27,300
I know that I know I remember the time of this night exactly.

1089
00:51:27,300 --> 00:51:31,200
But we're just going to just producing the dealer store and

1090
00:51:31,200 --> 00:51:33,100
and Caleb is looking at this bright orange.

1091
00:51:33,100 --> 00:51:36,600
That's because you rehearsed this because it is a lie.

1092
00:51:36,600 --> 00:51:40,800
Yeah, I remember the timeline exactly and it actually was

1093
00:51:40,800 --> 00:51:41,200
different.

1094
00:51:41,200 --> 00:51:44,200
So well remember say it backwards if you know it so well.

1095
00:51:44,200 --> 00:51:47,400
Okay, so that's not backwards.

1096
00:51:47,400 --> 00:51:49,900
I would start at Caleb is already.

1097
00:51:49,900 --> 00:51:52,500
It's pissed at me because I copied him and it's just looking

1098
00:51:52,500 --> 00:51:56,900
this bright orange jacket and being like, "I hate this. I'm going to give this away,

1099
00:51:56,900 --> 00:52:03,700
this jacket that cost me like $80." And then before that, we were walking out of the Adidas store and

1100
00:52:03,700 --> 00:52:09,540
before that we were both buying the jackets. And before that, I decided to buy the jacket because

1101
00:52:09,540 --> 00:52:13,300
I loved the material. And I never had a coach jacket before. So it sounds like Caleb thought

1102
00:52:13,300 --> 00:52:17,940
about buying the jacket before you in this timeline of events. That's what you just said.

1103
00:52:17,940 --> 00:52:20,780
It is a completely, it's a completely different color.

1104
00:52:20,780 --> 00:52:22,780
And you don't even have yours anymore.

1105
00:52:22,780 --> 00:52:23,780
I mean, it's what you said.

1106
00:52:23,780 --> 00:52:27,220
I'm not trying to catch you in a lie, but in the reverse order,

1107
00:52:27,220 --> 00:52:31,500
the thing that happened last was you deciding to buy the jacket.

1108
00:52:31,500 --> 00:52:32,160
Okay.

1109
00:52:32,160 --> 00:52:33,060
It's what you just said.

1110
00:52:33,060 --> 00:52:38,540
If that was the case anyways, I love mine and I wear mine all the time.

1111
00:52:38,540 --> 00:52:42,180
I want you to go ahead and wave at the camera because you are going to be on

1112
00:52:42,180 --> 00:52:45,100
JCS criminal psychology very, very shortly.

1113
00:52:45,100 --> 00:52:46,580
I'm not going to be in JCS.

1114
00:52:46,860 --> 00:52:49,140
- You will be on Jaycee's for this.

1115
00:52:49,140 --> 00:52:50,300
- No.

1116
00:52:50,300 --> 00:52:52,780
- He claims that he bought the jacket first,

1117
00:52:52,780 --> 00:52:54,540
but he admits in the reverse telling

1118
00:52:54,540 --> 00:52:57,620
that he bought it well after Caleb.

1119
00:52:57,620 --> 00:52:59,900
- So where's your jacket then?

1120
00:52:59,900 --> 00:53:00,720
- You will be on that.

1121
00:53:00,720 --> 00:53:01,760
My jacket? - Where's your jacket then?

1122
00:53:01,760 --> 00:53:05,540
- Probably in the fucking bin with the rubbish.

1123
00:53:05,540 --> 00:53:09,220
- Okay, so you, if there was something that we share,

1124
00:53:09,220 --> 00:53:11,900
I guess you could just completely destroy and hate

1125
00:53:11,900 --> 00:53:14,300
so much that you won't keep it and wear it all the time

1126
00:53:14,300 --> 00:53:15,120
like I do mine. - So you admit

1127
00:53:15,120 --> 00:53:17,120
was the same jacket if we're sharing it.

1128
00:53:17,120 --> 00:53:22,680
Okay, can we move on past this?

1129
00:53:22,680 --> 00:53:23,680
This is stupid.

1130
00:53:23,680 --> 00:53:26,560
I'm trying to plan a beautiful trip.

1131
00:53:26,560 --> 00:53:34,120
Every time I go to New York, that's probably the most uncomfortable shirt that I've ever

1132
00:53:34,120 --> 00:53:35,120
worn.

1133
00:53:35,120 --> 00:53:36,120
I know, it's so bad.

1134
00:53:36,120 --> 00:53:37,120
I hate it so much.

1135
00:53:37,120 --> 00:53:38,120
I've never worn it once.

1136
00:53:38,120 --> 00:53:41,760
I might have thrown it away also.

1137
00:53:41,760 --> 00:53:46,120
- I think we should have a matching shopping spree,

1138
00:53:46,120 --> 00:53:51,120
a makeover, and a sushi eating date on the same day.

1139
00:53:51,120 --> 00:53:56,160
- We should find a place to get the little spinner caps

1140
00:53:56,160 --> 00:53:58,520
and a big lollipop. - Yes, propeller hat, yeah.

1141
00:53:58,520 --> 00:54:00,800
- Yeah, and little shorts.

1142
00:54:00,800 --> 00:54:04,320
We could all maybe just turn into little boys like that

1143
00:54:04,320 --> 00:54:06,960
and just go to the fanciest restaurant we can afford.

1144
00:54:06,960 --> 00:54:09,320
- You guys know what I think we should do?

1145
00:54:09,320 --> 00:54:11,840
I think this is as fun as radio can get,

1146
00:54:11,840 --> 00:54:15,960
is three grown men planning a child's trip to New York City.

1147
00:54:15,960 --> 00:54:18,720
So you know what I think that we should do, guys,

1148
00:54:18,720 --> 00:54:21,720
is, and also one of them lives in the city,

1149
00:54:21,720 --> 00:54:23,320
but what I think we should do is

1150
00:54:23,320 --> 00:54:25,580
we should go see Wicked on Broadway.

1151
00:54:25,580 --> 00:54:29,560
My second time seeing it.

1152
00:54:29,560 --> 00:54:33,040
- I've never been to a Broadway show.

1153
00:54:33,040 --> 00:54:35,720
- I went one time, my mom was in town,

1154
00:54:35,720 --> 00:54:38,440
she was like, "I've always wanted to see a Broadway show.

1155
00:54:38,440 --> 00:54:39,960
Can we go see Wicked on Broadway?

1156
00:54:39,960 --> 00:54:42,200
And I was like, yeah, of course we go.

1157
00:54:42,200 --> 00:54:44,740
And I didn't realize this shit is fucking four hours long.

1158
00:54:44,740 --> 00:54:46,540
Oh, yeah. What? Yeah.

1159
00:54:46,540 --> 00:54:48,940
And I went I ordered I was like, oh, I got to get drunk.

1160
00:54:48,940 --> 00:54:51,100
So I went to the bar, ordered a double Jameson.

1161
00:54:51,100 --> 00:54:53,640
And the guy was like, that'll be $60.

1162
00:54:53,640 --> 00:54:58,840
It's insane. $60.

1163
00:54:58,840 --> 00:55:02,640
Yeah. And I think I maybe took like I think I took an Adderall that day.

1164
00:55:02,640 --> 00:55:05,500
So I was just sitting there thinking about playing video games the entire time.

1165
00:55:05,500 --> 00:55:06,260
Oh, my God.

1166
00:55:06,260 --> 00:55:09,380
And then eventually I got the last half of the play,

1167
00:55:09,380 --> 00:55:12,780
or the musical, I'm sitting in that chair with my eyes closed.

1168
00:55:12,780 --> 00:55:14,460
The last half, meaning the last two hours?

1169
00:55:14,460 --> 00:55:17,100
Yes, the last two hours I'm sitting in the chair

1170
00:55:17,100 --> 00:55:21,660
basically playing Valorant in my brain for two full hours.

1171
00:55:21,660 --> 00:55:23,740
It was so fucking awesome.

1172
00:55:23,740 --> 00:55:24,780
I loved it.

1173
00:55:24,780 --> 00:55:26,020
Yeah, I don't want to do that.

1174
00:55:26,020 --> 00:55:29,900
I don't want to go to Broadway for a Broadway show.

1175
00:55:29,900 --> 00:55:36,100
I want to go up on the Empire State Building.

1176
00:55:36,100 --> 00:55:37,780
- And then jump off.

1177
00:55:37,780 --> 00:55:42,220
- And then I go to the Statue of Liberty

1178
00:55:42,220 --> 00:55:45,120
and climb it.

1179
00:55:45,120 --> 00:55:49,140
- So you wanna do the King Kong tour?

1180
00:55:49,140 --> 00:55:50,300
- Yes.

1181
00:55:50,300 --> 00:55:53,660
I wanna do the Elf tour actually.

1182
00:55:53,660 --> 00:55:55,140
- I'll do the Elf tour.

1183
00:55:55,140 --> 00:55:59,100
We could go to the world's best coffee place.

1184
00:55:59,100 --> 00:56:00,540
We walk in, we could say,

1185
00:56:00,540 --> 00:56:03,660
congratulations, you have the world's best coffee.

1186
00:56:03,660 --> 00:56:05,220
- Do you think they get people like that

1187
00:56:05,220 --> 00:56:07,660
every single day that they've been open?

1188
00:56:07,660 --> 00:56:10,300
- I think that they probably do not have that sign up.

1189
00:56:10,300 --> 00:56:14,120
I think that we will go to Macy's,

1190
00:56:14,120 --> 00:56:17,860
and then we will go to the North Pole,

1191
00:56:17,860 --> 00:56:21,620
and then we will go to wherever

1192
00:56:21,620 --> 00:56:23,460
Zooey Deschanel is taking a shower.

1193
00:56:23,460 --> 00:56:25,100
We'll go in there as well.

1194
00:56:25,100 --> 00:56:27,420
- Yeah, the Macy's employee shower.

1195
00:56:27,420 --> 00:56:29,500
- Well, no, just wherever she is right now,

1196
00:56:29,500 --> 00:56:31,500
we'll go and watch her shower for just a couple minutes

1197
00:56:31,500 --> 00:56:32,780
and sing at her.

1198
00:56:32,780 --> 00:56:34,780
Isn't she married to a property brother now?

1199
00:56:34,780 --> 00:56:36,780
She might not be in New York anymore.

1200
00:56:36,780 --> 00:56:39,180
Honestly, that would piss me off so fucking much.

1201
00:56:39,180 --> 00:56:41,080
I'm almost positive that's true.

1202
00:56:41,080 --> 00:56:41,980
Yep.

1203
00:56:41,980 --> 00:56:42,580
I'm pissed off.

1204
00:56:42,580 --> 00:56:43,780
So thanks so much for that.

1205
00:56:43,780 --> 00:56:44,480
You're welcome.

1206
00:56:44,480 --> 00:56:49,080
And yeah, I've never been to the Empire State Building.

1207
00:56:49,080 --> 00:56:51,380
I've sat outside of it, but I've never been inside of there.

1208
00:56:51,380 --> 00:56:53,480
It's like it's missing something right now.

1209
00:56:53,480 --> 00:56:55,880
I don't think there's anything to do in the Empire State Building.

1210
00:56:55,880 --> 00:56:56,380
Well, you can go.

1211
00:56:56,380 --> 00:56:56,680
No.

1212
00:56:56,680 --> 00:56:58,780
Sell that to the act of going up.

1213
00:56:58,780 --> 00:56:59,380
Sure.

1214
00:56:59,980 --> 00:57:04,380
I actually, I did take one of those like tours or whatever.

1215
00:57:04,380 --> 00:57:06,460
When I went to Chicago, we went on the,

1216
00:57:06,460 --> 00:57:07,620
I forgot what building it was.

1217
00:57:07,620 --> 00:57:09,180
- Sears Tower.

1218
00:57:09,180 --> 00:57:10,940
- Maybe, I'm not, I don't know.

1219
00:57:10,940 --> 00:57:12,180
There's a lot of them.

1220
00:57:12,180 --> 00:57:14,300
- I don't remember where that is actually.

1221
00:57:14,300 --> 00:57:17,540
- And yeah, sure enough, you walk in the building,

1222
00:57:17,540 --> 00:57:21,940
you pay for a ticket, and then there's,

1223
00:57:21,940 --> 00:57:26,820
they make you wait around on this like gift store.

1224
00:57:26,820 --> 00:57:28,900
And then you take a crazy elevator

1225
00:57:28,900 --> 00:57:32,500
that goes up really fast, and then you're just up,

1226
00:57:32,500 --> 00:57:34,460
and you just look down and take a picture,

1227
00:57:34,460 --> 00:57:36,660
and then they're like, "Okay, you can get out,

1228
00:57:36,660 --> 00:57:38,100
"get out of here, get the fuck out of here."

1229
00:57:38,100 --> 00:57:38,940
- Yeah, that's not my favorite.

1230
00:57:38,940 --> 00:57:40,580
Are you guys afraid of heights?

1231
00:57:40,580 --> 00:57:41,420
- Not really.

1232
00:57:41,420 --> 00:57:42,260
- Not really.

1233
00:57:42,260 --> 00:57:44,960
- I always think I'm not until I do some shit like that.

1234
00:57:44,960 --> 00:57:50,540
I went to a rooftop bar with Noah a couple weeks ago,

1235
00:57:50,540 --> 00:57:51,740
and--

1236
00:57:51,740 --> 00:57:54,260
- How tall was it?

1237
00:57:54,260 --> 00:57:55,820
- It was pretty tall. - Two stories.

1238
00:57:55,820 --> 00:57:58,020
- No, it was like probably 20 stories high,

1239
00:57:58,020 --> 00:57:59,900
30 stories like that.

1240
00:57:59,900 --> 00:58:02,400
OK, and it was it was way too scary.

1241
00:58:02,400 --> 00:58:04,740
I do not recommend it, but we go in here.

1242
00:58:04,740 --> 00:58:08,200
Yeah, well, they they have these like, you know what I wish you could say?

1243
00:58:08,200 --> 00:58:10,500
Let's go to the Times Square casino.

1244
00:58:10,500 --> 00:58:12,620
I wish you could say that.

1245
00:58:12,620 --> 00:58:16,920
But these NIMBYs, I know, which I learned this word recently.

1246
00:58:16,920 --> 00:58:19,960
NIMBY, which means not in my backyard.

1247
00:58:19,960 --> 00:58:24,560
OK, are basically saying I fuck it, which a lot, you know,

1248
00:58:24,920 --> 00:58:27,720
These good people whose back is my backyard.

1249
00:58:27,720 --> 00:58:29,040
Yeah, yeah.

1250
00:58:29,040 --> 00:58:32,080
They they're saying I don't want casinos here, which I don't understand.

1251
00:58:32,080 --> 00:58:34,640
Times Square is already such a fucking shithole.

1252
00:58:34,640 --> 00:58:38,780
Just who let it just get worse and worse and worse.

1253
00:58:38,780 --> 00:58:40,680
Put fucking prostitutes there.

1254
00:58:40,680 --> 00:58:43,080
Let's put a waste management fucking plant there.

1255
00:58:43,080 --> 00:58:43,880
Who gives a shit?

1256
00:58:43,880 --> 00:58:47,480
Pump the gas directly into the New York Comedy Club.

1257
00:58:47,480 --> 00:58:48,580
I don't care.

1258
00:58:48,580 --> 00:58:52,680
Put a casino there.

1259
00:58:52,680 --> 00:58:54,220
Jay-Z wants to put a casino there.

1260
00:58:54,220 --> 00:58:58,420
It'd be the only place in all of New York City where you can have fresh air.

1261
00:58:58,420 --> 00:58:59,260
Yeah.

1262
00:58:59,260 --> 00:59:01,180
It's an amazing idea.

1263
00:59:01,180 --> 00:59:02,380
Yeah, exactly.

1264
00:59:02,380 --> 00:59:02,820
Yeah.

1265
00:59:02,820 --> 00:59:06,620
It's time to square the, uh, the, uh, the M&M Plaza.

1266
00:59:06,620 --> 00:59:07,540
Yes.

1267
00:59:07,540 --> 00:59:08,660
Okay.

1268
00:59:08,660 --> 00:59:09,060
I see.

1269
00:59:09,060 --> 00:59:10,180
It's the one with all the screens.

1270
00:59:10,180 --> 00:59:11,260
Are you stupid?

1271
00:59:11,260 --> 00:59:12,060
Okay.

1272
00:59:12,060 --> 00:59:12,740
You've been there.

1273
00:59:12,740 --> 00:59:13,980
Yeah, I've been there.

1274
00:59:13,980 --> 00:59:15,340
M&M Plaza.

1275
00:59:15,340 --> 00:59:16,420
Yeah.

1276
00:59:16,420 --> 00:59:18,260
Well, that's the only thing to do there.

1277
00:59:18,260 --> 00:59:19,900
Just go to the M&M store.

1278
00:59:19,900 --> 00:59:22,900
Well, I actually, we went to the Harry Potter store last time, if you

1279
00:59:22,900 --> 00:59:25,860
would remember correctly. No, we went to the Disney store.

1280
00:59:25,860 --> 00:59:31,700
And we did go to the Disney store. And Rex took a really racist picture that I've shown people a lot of times.

1281
00:59:31,700 --> 00:59:34,200
He took one of the most racist photos ever made.

1282
00:59:34,200 --> 00:59:37,460
You sexually harassed Minnie Mouse.

1283
00:59:37,460 --> 00:59:41,200
Me? You were sexually harassing Minnie Mouse? Yeah, you touched her breasts.

1284
00:59:41,200 --> 00:59:45,200
I photoed that. She's not even fucking real, mate. You were touching her?

1285
00:59:45,200 --> 00:59:49,700
I think you're allowed to touch. They were selling rice paddy hats.

1286
00:59:49,700 --> 00:59:52,420
Is it so wrong to take a picture wearing one?

1287
00:59:52,420 --> 00:59:54,420
They were selling rice paddy hats.

1288
00:59:54,420 --> 00:59:56,420
Okay, here's why it was wrong.

1289
00:59:56,420 --> 00:59:58,420
Here's why it was wrong, okay?

1290
00:59:58,420 --> 01:00:00,420
It's two-pronged.

1291
01:00:00,420 --> 01:00:02,420
Number one, you held your hands like this.

1292
01:00:02,420 --> 01:00:06,420
I do that when I go to any place.

1293
01:00:06,420 --> 01:00:09,420
Number two, you were standing right next to Annie,

1294
01:00:09,420 --> 01:00:11,420
who is Chinese.

1295
01:00:11,420 --> 01:00:13,420
Mm-hmm.

1296
01:00:13,420 --> 01:00:15,420
She was wearing my hat. It was a cultural exchange.

1297
01:00:15,420 --> 01:00:17,420
But again, it kind of felt like you were like...

1298
01:00:17,420 --> 01:00:21,380
is kind of look the photos of the circuit so i ran in chinese lady walked up

1299
01:00:21,380 --> 01:00:24,980
about the right that he had you're like a can i take a photo with you

1300
01:00:24,980 --> 01:00:26,660
for a ticket with your hands

1301
01:00:26,660 --> 01:00:30,900
i'm here and here's the to to work as the fact checker for this uh... this

1302
01:00:30,900 --> 01:00:32,020
dispute

1303
01:00:32,020 --> 01:00:34,180
resonate

1304
01:00:34,180 --> 01:00:37,300
there are a statistic they do so right studies

1305
01:00:37,300 --> 01:00:40,220
they would have run over ten hitlers instead of me

1306
01:00:40,220 --> 01:00:43,860
they were run over ten hitlers rex does do that with his hands

1307
01:00:43,860 --> 01:00:46,660
literally everywhere he goes up

1308
01:00:46,660 --> 01:00:48,660
Annie was not a random Chinese person.

1309
01:00:48,660 --> 01:00:50,660
I'm like the good doctor for being polite in a Japanese way.

1310
01:00:50,660 --> 01:00:54,660
We did go to the Nintendo store and we kept losing Annie and mistaking it for other women there.

1311
01:00:54,660 --> 01:00:58,660
So I think that's the most racist thing.

1312
01:00:58,660 --> 01:01:00,660
Okay, we can end on that because I have to leave.

1313
01:01:00,660 --> 01:01:02,660
That is true.

1314
01:01:02,660 --> 01:01:04,660
Alright, bye.
