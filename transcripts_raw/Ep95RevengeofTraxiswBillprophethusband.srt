1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,160
You're listening to Israel's number one podcast.

2
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:06,740
(upbeat music)

3
00:00:06,740 --> 00:00:11,140
- You're a crap monster.

4
00:00:11,140 --> 00:00:13,100
(laughing)

5
00:00:13,100 --> 00:00:13,940
- Okay.

6
00:00:13,940 --> 00:00:14,780
- Yeah.

7
00:00:14,780 --> 00:00:15,600
(laughing)

8
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:16,440
- Woo.

9
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:19,040
- All right, we're here with, we got Bill on the line.

10
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:21,040
We're zooming, we're zoomed up.

11
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:21,880
- Mm-hmm.

12
00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:24,680
- First international call we've done.

13
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:25,520
- Yeah.

14
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:26,340
- Oh, how's that?

15
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:27,180
- This is crazy.

16
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:28,000
We're going worldwide, baby.

17
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:28,840
- Yeah.

18
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:29,680
- Yeah, podcast about us.

19
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:36,680
about this worldwide. The world domination episode. First European, um, yeah. No, Leo.

20
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:41,960
Oh Leo, yeah, what am I thinking? Well, no, he's British, that does not count. That's

21
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:48,960
true. That's actually true. Yeah, that is a good point. First good European. Yeah. But

22
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:57,800
yeah, Bill, thank you for coming, you know. Have you been, what's it like in, what country

23
00:00:57,800 --> 00:00:58,800
Where do you live in?

24
00:00:58,800 --> 00:00:59,800
Sweden.

25
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:00,800
Sweden, yeah.

26
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:02,160
What's shit like there?

27
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:05,040
Are you guys trapped inside?

28
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:10,000
Well, it's kind of, we're getting, our government is getting critiqued from everyone right now

29
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,800
because we haven't really done anything.

30
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:15,160
Nice, you seem to be, you know, chilling.

31
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:17,160
Yeah, I mean everything is kind of open.

32
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:21,640
They're sort of just expecting everyone to not go outside.

33
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:22,640
And not get sick.

34
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:23,640
And I don't think it's working that well.

35
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:30,360
A lot of people are getting sick disproportionately from other Scandinavian countries, so probably

36
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:31,840
going to lock everything down.

37
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:32,840
Nice, dude.

38
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:33,840
I'm excited.

39
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:35,200
That's probably the good way to go.

40
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:37,760
But you guys don't have guns or anything.

41
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:38,760
Nope.

42
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:39,760
Unfortunately not.

43
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:43,000
I really don't have a gun.

44
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,920
Can you like, will they put you in jail for saying that on a podcast?

45
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:49,080
No, it's not that bad.

46
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:53,260
I mean, today I was out, I wanted to get some like,

47
00:01:53,260 --> 00:01:56,560
some kind of Tylenol or something,

48
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:59,880
but I couldn't find anything good.

49
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:04,480
And I just, I would trade every single part of this,

50
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:07,320
you know, shitty socialist welfare state

51
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:12,320
for just access to guns and like Tylenol

52
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:15,840
with codeine or something.

53
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:16,680
- Yeah.

54
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:21,480
So you want to live, so socialism doesn't matter to you, guns and drugs.

55
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:22,480
Exactly.

56
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:26,440
I feel like if you have a gun you can make your own socialism.

57
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:28,640
There we go.

58
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:35,840
We gotta fly Bill out to Arizona and just like drop you in Albuquerque like a battle

59
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:43,040
royale game out of a helicopter and just be like, just see how much damage you can cause

60
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:46,240
before they extradite you to like some Ikea living room.

61
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:47,520
(laughing)

62
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:49,360
- Just carve out new Sweden.

63
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:51,000
- Yeah, yeah.

64
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,240
(laughing)

65
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:56,080
- Yeah, it sounds awesome.

66
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:57,720
You're drinking some made up beer.

67
00:02:57,720 --> 00:02:58,560
- Yes.

68
00:02:58,560 --> 00:02:59,380
- I see.

69
00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:00,220
- Exactly.

70
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:01,060
- What's it called?

71
00:03:01,060 --> 00:03:02,040
- Hengelhofer or something?

72
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:02,880
- Almost.

73
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:03,720
- Hopstetter.

74
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:04,680
- Hockenberry.

75
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:05,560
- Hockenberry.

76
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:07,140
- Hopping buddy.

77
00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:08,640
(laughing)

78
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:09,640
- The hopping buddy.

79
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:12,240
It sounds delicious.

80
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:14,240
I'm drinking a Coors Light, you know.

81
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:15,240
At 3am.

82
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:16,240
Or 6pm.

83
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:19,240
I thought, yeah, at 3am.

84
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:20,240
Fuck!

85
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:21,240
There's nothing wrong with that.

86
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:22,240
There's a, I mean.

87
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:23,240
Yeah, it's a light beer.

88
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:24,240
It's like, doesn't count.

89
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:25,240
Exactly, yeah.

90
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:29,560
It's a, it might as well be a Diet Coke, which I'm also drinking.

91
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:31,740
So I have both.

92
00:03:31,740 --> 00:03:32,740
You should mix them.

93
00:03:32,740 --> 00:03:34,480
You should put them in a cup and mix them.

94
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:35,480
That's what I'm doing.

95
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:37,000
I'm mixing them in my mouth though.

96
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,920
I take one sip and then the other.

97
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:42,640
You should get like a straw system.

98
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:43,640
Yeah.

99
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:47,040
I could get, what I should do is get one of those funny hats that holds two cans.

100
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:48,040
Genius.

101
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:50,120
And put one in both.

102
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:52,960
That's what those are for, for mixing drinks.

103
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:54,680
That's right.

104
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:56,360
That's how bartenders mix the drinks.

105
00:03:56,360 --> 00:04:02,040
You guys put rum and coke, they put one can of rum and one of coke, they suck it in and

106
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:03,040
then spit it into a glass.

107
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:05,800
Oh, could you imagine a can of rum?

108
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:06,800
Yeah.

109
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:07,800
That would taste.

110
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:08,800
They probably have that.

111
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:15,720
like a thing yeah a can of rum don't you guys have bag milk no no you're not that

112
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:22,160
weird oh I lived in Canada for a while and I saw that there and wild it's so

113
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:29,720
just just doesn't it looks like they took that out of the cow just surgically

114
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:36,000
remove the milk membrane out of the cow it's like those extraterrestrial maimings

115
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,440
when someone's cut out the like the vagina of a cow or something?

116
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:40,440
Yeah, exactly.

117
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:43,920
Did you just cut out the milk bag?

118
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:45,800
And do you just cut off a corner?

119
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:46,800
I've never, I've never...

120
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:49,600
No, it has, it has got a nipple on it.

121
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:54,760
Yeah, so it's to get the full cow experience.

122
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:55,760
It's pink.

123
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:59,960
Yeah, it's a pink, it's a pink bag full of white goo.

124
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:02,960
Yeah, it's not even milk.

125
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:03,960
Oh, fuck.

126
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:04,960
It's bad.

127
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:05,960
It's bag milk.

128
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:06,960
It's a different liquid.

129
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:07,960
Yeah, it's not from a cow.

130
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:08,960
It's from a bag.

131
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:09,960
That's where they get it from.

132
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:10,960
God, dude.

133
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:15,960
I'm so glad I live in America, the greatest country on earth.

134
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:17,960
I wouldn't live anywhere else.

135
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:19,960
Look, we got to get you out here, Bill.

136
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:20,960
We got to move you out here.

137
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:21,960
That would be sick.

138
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:22,960
Let's do it.

139
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:23,960
I love that.

140
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:30,960
We're just going to funnel the Patreon money to you and fund your reality TV show about

141
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:31,960
you and America.

142
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:34,720
We're gonna make the podcast about List compound.

143
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:35,560
Yeah, yeah.

144
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:36,400
It's gonna be.

145
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:37,660
(laughing)

146
00:05:37,660 --> 00:05:38,580
Yeah, exactly.

147
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:41,440
Like the, what's his name?

148
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:42,280
Like Anthony.

149
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:43,520
David Koresh or?

150
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:45,780
(laughing)

151
00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:48,340
No, we're gonna make a compound media,

152
00:05:48,340 --> 00:05:49,720
but it's part about List.

153
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:50,560
Oh, okay.

154
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:52,620
Oh, did you say Dave Anthony?

155
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:53,680
No, I said.

157
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:56,080
The guy from the dollop?

00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:57,940
Yeah, the guy from the dollop.

You look like a big baby.

00:07:58,080 --> 00:07:59,080

210
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:01,080
I think I'm gonna shave my head today.

211
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:03,400
Dude, if you shave your head, you're gonna look like fucking Baby New Year.

212
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:04,400
You should shave your head.

213
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:05,400
I won't.

214
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:06,400
You should pull out...

215
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:07,400
Yeah, you will.

216
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:08,400
I won't.

217
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:09,400
You should pull out all your teeth except for one of the front teeth.

218
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:10,400
One?

219
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:11,400
It's just one!

220
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:12,400
Should I become like a prospector?

221
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:13,400
Like a baby.

222
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:14,400
Like a cartoon.

223
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:15,400
No, not like a baby.

224
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:18,400
You should have one curly hair on top of your head.

225
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:20,200
You get one big curly cartoon hair.

226
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:24,880
You should look like that monkey from Super Monkey Ball with the big spiral ears.

227
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:27,880
No, I'm not going to look like that.

228
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:32,920
I'm going to look like Jason Statham, the transporter.

229
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:34,960
And I'm going to do stuff like he does in Crank.

230
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:35,960
High voltage.

231
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:39,680
You're going to be a transporter, but you're going to roll around in a monkey ball.

232
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:45,680
No, I will not roll around in a monkey ball to protect my, the person.

233
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:49,960
You're going to go collect bananas for a shadow corporation.

234
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:52,000
I have no interest in collecting bananas.

235
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:58,320
I just want to shave my head and do cool ninja stuff, which I am going to do.

236
00:08:58,320 --> 00:08:59,320
I'm going to do...

237
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:03,200
What kind of kung fu does Jason Statham do?

238
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:04,200
Is he trained?

239
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:05,200
You say murder fu?

240
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:06,200
Murder fu?

241
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:07,200
Yeah.

242
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,200
Is that where you...

243
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:11,040
If you kill anybody with karate, it's a new thing.

244
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:12,540
That's like what John Wick does.

245
00:09:12,540 --> 00:09:13,540
It's like murder fu.

246
00:09:13,540 --> 00:09:18,680
He does some sort of kung fu thing, but it involves shooting people.

247
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:19,680
Is that...

248
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:21,680
Is that real? Is that a real thing?

249
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:23,680
It's like bullets with your hands.

250
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:25,680
Sounds like a real thing.

251
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:27,680
I will give you that much, Bill.

252
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:29,680
It does sound real.

253
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:31,680
Yeah, you go into like a

254
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:33,680
a kung fu

255
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:35,680
learning place and being like

256
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:37,680
no, I want to learn murder food.

257
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:39,680
It's called a dojo, but

258
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:41,680
I'll let that slide.

259
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:43,680
Isn't a dojo Japanese?

260
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:45,680
No, you're thinking of Mojo Jojojo,

261
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:47,680
the Japanese monkey from

262
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:48,680
Yeah, the Powerpuff Girls.

263
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:49,680
You.

264
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:50,680
Short little monkey.

265
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:51,680
Yeah, that's you.

266
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:52,680
You're an evil green monkey.

267
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:53,680
No.

268
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:54,680
Yeah, you are.

269
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:55,680
No, no, no, no, no, no.

270
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:56,680
Which one are you saying, Pat?

271
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:57,680
Who are you saying it is?

272
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:58,680
What?

273
00:09:58,680 --> 00:09:59,680
Mojo Jojo?

274
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:00,680
Mojo Jojo.

275
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:01,680
If anyone looks most like Mojo Jojo, it's gotta be you.

276
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:02,680
It's gotta be Bill.

277
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:03,680
No.

278
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:04,680
I have no idea who you guys are talking about.

279
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:05,680
You've never seen, I guess you didn't grow, did you grow up watching any American cartoons?

280
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:06,680
Yeah, the Simpsons.

281
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:07,680
All right, well, stop.

282
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:08,680
I'm not gonna say anything.

283
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:09,680
I'm not gonna say anything.

284
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:10,680
I'm not gonna say anything.

285
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:11,680
I'm not gonna say anything.

286
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:24,680
watching any American cartoons? Yeah, The Simpsons. Alright, we'll stick to The Simpsons. That's my frame of reference for American cartoons. I've seen like two episodes of King of the Hill.

287
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:30,440
Oh, you got to get on that dude. Yeah. We watch King of the Hill, we'll have you on

288
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:37,440
again and just do King of the Hill stuff. Yeah. We'll only reference King of the Hill. Yeah.

289
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:41,840
just so you get it. The Swedish version of King of the Hill is called Lord of the

290
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:49,840
Mountain. Exactly. Yeah that's the dubbed version. Yeah. Lord of the Steak. It's called Steak of the Hill.

291
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:58,160
Yeah and it's eight guys in a backyard all sipping whatever fucked up beer

292
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:05,840
your dad's. Just going "da". That's German man, come on. That's Russian. I don't know.

293
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:14,960
Is that Russian? Da is Russian. Unless it's also German. Da means dad. What? No. Da doesn't

294
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:20,080
mean dad. Yeah it does, it's Scottish. You're thinking of dada, which is baby language.

295
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:22,080
Yeah, that's what Patrick calls his dad.

296
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:24,080
Yeah, that's what I call my dad.

297
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:26,080
Da-da.

298
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:28,080
I call my dad Dada.

299
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:30,080
Alright, so, uh,

300
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:32,080
Bill, if you, if

301
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:34,080
the Simpsons is your frame of reference,

302
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:36,080
just know that, um,

303
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:38,080
in this podcast, Patrick

304
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:40,080
is, uh, uh, Ralph

305
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:42,080
Wiggum. Yep. Uh,

306
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:44,080
I'm Homer and Cameron is Apu.

307
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:46,080
Okay.

308
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:48,080
I was gonna say that Cameron was Marge.

309
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:50,080
No, he's definitely a poo.

310
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:52,080
Get to know him.

311
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:54,080
He's a poo.

312
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:56,080
He really is.

313
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:58,080
I think he should do the accent right now.

314
00:11:58,080 --> 00:12:00,080
He does it off mic.

315
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:02,080
He does it off mic.

316
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:04,080
Right now he's doing a voice because he

317
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:06,080
went to a production school.

318
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:08,080
I feel insecure about my accent.

319
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:10,080
About my real accent.

320
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:12,080
I like to cover it up when I'm recording.

321
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:14,080
Yeah, he thinks people will get the wrong idea

322
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:16,080
about him if he does the accent.

323
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:19,080
Yeah, they'll stereotype him based on his accent.

324
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:20,080
Yeah.

325
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:25,120
Alright, um, top ten coolest names.

326
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:27,880
Number one, um, Neo.

327
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:31,080
Right off the bat.

328
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:37,680
Yeah, I mean I guess my question would be like, is there any other Neo besides Neo?

329
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:38,880
It's not really a name.

330
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:43,760
I've never met a guy who's like, "Hi, I'm Neo."

331
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:47,200
i've never had like a little bit all of garden with the new york and about the

332
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:48,960
singer

333
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:51,360
new are

334
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:54,880
uh... i think there's i think he has periods between the you know it's it's

335
00:12:54,880 --> 00:13:01,880
an e_t_ dash why i think i'm pretty sure it's been a short for neil young

336
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:09,780
yet this is uh... yet i i i guess it is a cool name

337
00:13:09,780 --> 00:13:11,520
not sure it's number one

338
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:14,720
the on the first few comments on this are insane

339
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:18,280
uh... there's with the one comment here says

340
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:22,680
the only meal that i know is a psychopathic dog that lights like seeing

341
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:25,720
fire and literally tries to catch bullets

342
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:28,760
i'm surprised he's still alive especially after attempting to eat a

343
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:35,760
bottle rocket that was about to go out

344
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:40,440
Someone's dog names is Neo.

345
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:43,440
Someone named their dog after fucking the Matrix dude?

346
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:44,440
Come on.

347
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:45,440
That's boss.

348
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:46,440
And then it tries to catch bullets.

349
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:48,960
This dog has no idea what Neo's supposed to do.

350
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:49,960
He's supposed to dodge bullets.

351
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:50,960
Not the opposite.

352
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:51,960
He's not here to live up.

353
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:58,760
But it was about to launch the ball rocket so in my head he's picking it clean out of

354
00:13:58,760 --> 00:14:00,880
the air.

355
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:01,880
That's impressive.

356
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:02,880
Yeah.

357
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:07,680
he's young you know what they've got to get it

358
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:09,840
and that the comment right after that says

Yeah, we're overthinking it. It just sounds cool.

387
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:29,020
Yeah.

388
00:15:29,020 --> 00:15:32,320
Somebody says, "LOL my name's Neo."

389
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:38,720
My favorite is, "I dated a Neo once. He was obsessed with porn."

390
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:44,220
Hold on baby, I have to go watch porn.

391
00:15:44,220 --> 00:15:47,720
And then he just plugs his computer into the back of his fucking head.

00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:54,420
And then he cums his pants. Cums starts bleeding out of his eyes.

that's what it is

405
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:28,400
Yeah, is there a lot of Brunos in your life?

406
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:33,680
I don't think there's ever been a Bruno in my life.

407
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:36,000
No, let me introduce you to a little movie

408
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,720
by a man named Sasha Baron Borat.

409
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:42,560
Oh shit, I watched Borat yesterday.

410
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:43,560
For the first time?

411
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:46,120
No, no, no, no, for the 11th time.

412
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:46,960
Oh Jesus.

413
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:47,780
It's still great.

414
00:16:47,780 --> 00:16:48,800
Oh, it's the best movie ever.

415
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:50,920
Every single time I smoke weed,

416
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:54,880
I have like a panic attack in my brain

417
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:57,440
and then I look at my girlfriend and I say,

418
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:58,540
I have to watch Borat.

419
00:16:58,540 --> 00:17:01,280
The only cure.

420
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:03,940
Yes, it is the only cure.

421
00:17:03,940 --> 00:17:07,560
I wrote a, I had to write an academic paper

422
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:09,440
and I didn't know what to do it on

423
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:11,360
for my fucking sex and comedy class

424
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:13,840
and I just wrote it about Borat.

425
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:16,440
What was your thesis?

426
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:19,380
It was called a sex and comedy class

427
00:17:19,380 --> 00:17:20,620
and I needed to fill a credit,

428
00:17:20,620 --> 00:17:24,080
So I took that and I don't remember.

429
00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:26,100
- Don't act like you're trying to fill a credit.

430
00:17:26,100 --> 00:17:27,300
No, you wanted to take it.

431
00:17:27,300 --> 00:17:28,500
You wanted to take that class.

432
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:29,340
- I did.

433
00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:30,160
- You saw that class.

434
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:31,620
- Before I went to the first class

435
00:17:31,620 --> 00:17:32,740
and the guy was like,

436
00:17:32,740 --> 00:17:35,720
"If you take out your phone, I'm gonna mark you absent."

437
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:38,780
- So why didn't you switch?

438
00:17:38,780 --> 00:17:40,980
- 'Cause it was the day after the ad drop date.

439
00:17:40,980 --> 00:17:43,280
- If it was the first class, it couldn't have been.

440
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:44,380
- It was 'cause we--

441
00:17:44,380 --> 00:17:45,220
- No.

442
00:17:45,220 --> 00:17:46,060
- It was a memorial day.

443
00:17:46,060 --> 00:17:48,440
- Patrick was the teacher of the class.

444
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:49,280
- No, I wasn't.

445
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:50,420
- He was.

446
00:17:50,420 --> 00:17:51,700
I did not teach the class.

447
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:52,700
He taught it.

448
00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:57,620
Yeah, he would bring in various silicone toys and fuck them in front of the class while

449
00:17:57,620 --> 00:18:01,300
he was laughing like the Joker.

450
00:18:01,300 --> 00:18:03,000
And that was the whole class.

451
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,300
And then everybody got an F.

452
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:08,980
An F for fucking.

453
00:18:08,980 --> 00:18:13,660
I gave all my students F for fucking because it was a sex class.

454
00:18:13,660 --> 00:18:17,000
I want to know more about this class.

455
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,080
It was just academic bullshit.

456
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:23,240
It was just like, "Oh, well, fucking..."

457
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:24,240
I don't know why you did that stuff.

458
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:25,240
It was like that, yeah.

459
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:26,240
Yeah.

460
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:27,240
Yeah, you know, just shit like that.

461
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:31,240
All MLA formatted, just duh, duh, duh, duh, duh, duh, duh, duh, duh, duh, duh, duh, duh,

462
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:32,240
duh, duh, duh, duh, duh, duh, duh, duh.

463
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:35,080
But I got a D minus in that class.

464
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:36,080
Woo.

465
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:37,080
Nice.

466
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:39,320
It's because you weren't good enough at sex with the teacher.

467
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:40,320
No.

468
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:41,320
Yeah, that's because I hate sex.

469
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:42,320
The final quiz.

470
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:43,320
Yeah.

471
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:44,320
The pop quiz at the end.

472
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:47,320
Yeah, have funny sex.

473
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:49,560
(laughing)

474
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:52,740
But yeah, Bruno, bad name.

475
00:18:52,740 --> 00:18:54,760
Not a good name.

476
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:55,960
- There's a comment here that says,

477
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:58,920
"Because there aren't enough gay words already."

478
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:01,640
(laughing)

479
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:03,440
- Yeah, throw another, yeah, fuck it,

480
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:04,760
throw another one on the pile.

481
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:05,600
Bruno.

482
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:08,080
Yeah, we already have Stig.

483
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:09,120
Throw Bruno on there.

484
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:11,080
I'm sorry, Bill.

485
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:12,160
- That's all right.

486
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:13,000
- I'm a monster.

487
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,280
- Oh, Bruno Mars.

488
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:17,640
uh... bruno mars

489
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:20,880
that's one of the comments is i'd like bruno because he is like the singer

490
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:22,280

491
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:26,060
and even think about bruno mars i forgot about him

492
00:19:26,060 --> 00:19:29,280
uh... but i don't like to do the person who says this was this terrible i could

493
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:31,920
think of a better name how about a dolph

494
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:33,800
the

495
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:37,960
selected prospectors apparently

496
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:40,280
yeah he he got a little bit

497
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:46,080
I'm hopping on the top tens.

498
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:49,080
Yeah top ten easiest post offices to shoot up.

499
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:53,960
God he would crush it on this website dude.

500
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:59,120
Someone says sounds like a very 80s disco dancer with an alfro and sideburns.

501
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:01,880
An alfro?

502
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:05,520
That's when Alf sits on your head.

503
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:09,480
Yeah when he sits his asshole over your head like a cap.

504
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:13,280
Yeah, and he sits there and he's like, "Hey, what am I, chopped liver?"

505
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:14,280
You know, classic Alf shit.

506
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:15,280
Is that what he says?

507
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:17,520
I never watched Alf.

508
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:20,580
That wasn't, um, that wasn't really my scene.

509
00:20:20,580 --> 00:20:25,760
The dad from Alf, I remember finding this out as a kid, the guy who played the dad on

510
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:30,640
Alf was addicted to crack.

511
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:31,640
There's a video of him.

512
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:32,640
That's boss.

513
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:36,020
There's a video of him with a sex worker smoking crack.

514
00:20:36,020 --> 00:20:39,280
I mean, wouldn't you also be addicted to crack if you were an actor?

515
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:44,080
you had your most popular co-star was a fucking monster puppet?

516
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:45,280
if you were alph's dad.

517
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:46,000
some aardvark?

518
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:49,520
if you if you had a baby that was alph

519
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:54,240
yeah if you had to deal with alph's bullshit all day you might smoke crack too

520
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:59,600
that's true this guy with his fucking snout trying to eat my cat all day

521
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:02,960
yeah he was never the same after alph ate his cat on set

522
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:14,640
Al started hanging up signs on set that it was like Tuesday bring your cat to work.

523
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:18,560
The last comment on Bruno is a little poem here.

524
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:20,680
It's a beautiful poem.

525
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:24,640
Yeah, it says, "Bruno, wow, amazing.

526
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:27,000
Bruno just sounds so awesome.

527
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,840
Bruno has some amazing flair to it."

528
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:30,840
It's really beautiful.

529
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:31,840
That is, that's incredible.

530
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:32,840
That's incredible.

531
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:33,840
Yeah.

532
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:34,840
I want to put that on a card.

533
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:38,840
Put that on a card and give it to my friend Bruno.

534
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:39,840
Yeah.

535
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:43,840
Uh, number three, this is a terrible name.

536
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:44,840
Uh, Holden.

537
00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:45,840
Yeah.

538
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:46,840
Someone's read a book.

539
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:47,840
Like, yeah.

540
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:52,840
I know a lot of homeschooled Holdens.

541
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:53,840
Yeah.

542
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:54,840
Yeah.

543
00:21:54,840 --> 00:21:55,840
That's probably not good.

544
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:59,840
If your name is Holden, they make you homeschooled.

545
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:02,240
school. You're not allowed to go to normal school.

546
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:07,520
Because if you go to public school then you'd get set, your name would turn into Holden

547
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:12,680
my balls. Yeah, I do think kids with stupid names should,

548
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:16,920
they just shouldn't be allowed to go to public school. It's just for their own sake. You

549
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:25,920
know, you shouldn't be around other children if your name is Holden or Suck My or something

550
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:32,480
like that. Or like Jeffrey Homo or something like that. Yeah, Peter Gawah. Just don't let

551
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:39,480
the kid, there's no need for that. Homosexual Michael. Kids are going to take that the wrong

552
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:48,960
way. Black David. It's just not a good, is that a celebrity in your country Bill? Black

553
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:52,960
David is something like that, right? He's Santa Claus's friend?

554
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:57,960
Yeah, that's a Dutch thing, right?

555
00:22:57,960 --> 00:23:00,960
Yeah, Schwarza Peter.

556
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:02,960
Yeah, exactly, Black Peter.

557
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:05,960
But he wouldn't be allowed in public school.

558
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:09,960
Mr. Poop, if you name your kid Mr. Poop.

559
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:12,960
Yeah, Cartman.

560
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:20,120
You're asking for a world of trouble sending your kid Cartman to school.

561
00:23:20,120 --> 00:23:24,120
Just a bad idea. Yeah.

562
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:29,320
Um, let's see the comments. Uh, that's my name.

563
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:37,720
Holden. Holden Maccock. Nice. See, what did I tell you?

564
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:42,680
That's just a bad idea. Just all around. What are you doing, Holden?

565
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:45,960
Number four is Miles.

566
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:47,320
That's a pretty normal name.

567
00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:48,680
Yeah, that one sucks.

568
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:50,840
Or, I'm sorry, Bill, Meters.

569
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:51,840
Ah!

570
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:52,840
Ah, ha ha!

571
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:53,840
Ah!

572
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:54,840
Ah, fuck, dude.

573
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:55,840
God damn it.

574
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:56,840
Caleb, lay off the guy.

575
00:23:56,840 --> 00:23:57,840
Yeah, come on, man.

576
00:23:57,840 --> 00:23:58,840
I'm sorry.

577
00:23:58,840 --> 00:23:59,840
Come on.

578
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:00,840
I'm sorry.

579
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:05,840
I come on here as a sign of, you know, as a gesture of good faith.

580
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:08,600
And I do anti-Swedish racism to you.

581
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:10,640
To heal the fractures between our nations.

582
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:16,240
and yeah you're gonna start a war Caleb yeah this is it this you came this is a

583
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:26,680
diplomatic mission yeah we're trying to yeah we're trying to heal the the divide

584
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:39,640
between America and Sweden Miles I just think of tails yeah from Sonic miles

585
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:40,640
Miles Prower?

586
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:41,640
Yeah.

587
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:45,800
It says, "This guy is the beast."

588
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:51,000
I know a guy named Miles, he's good at no-scoping me, from Eli HBK.

589
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,720
That's fucked up.

590
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:58,960
Someone says, "I always use this in my books."

591
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:02,640
Miles has good manners, and that's what matters.

592
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:05,800
That's nice, dude.

593
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:07,800
It was nice dude.

594
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:10,800
I don't think I've ever met a Miles, honestly.

595
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:12,800
It's my nephew's middle name.

596
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:15,800
I feel like that's like a smart guy name.

597
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:22,800
This kid Miles that went to summer camp with me in middle school used to pretend to be a dog.

598
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:24,800
Yeah, what did I say?

599
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:27,800
It's the name of a very intelligent guy.

600
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:31,800
I only think of Mikey Miles or Mickey Miles.

601
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:39,040
Oh, Mikey Miles is definitely... Mickey Miles. I'm just imagining him with big Mickey Mouse

602
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:46,320
ears. Yeah, that's what we call Mickey Mouse here. It's Mickey Miles.

603
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:49,200
Number five, Trinity. This is... I mean, I don't know what...

604
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:53,200
Yeah, Morpheus is going to be later on.

605
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:58,280
It's funny that like Neo is a name I've never heard. Trinity is a name I've heard probably

606
00:25:58,280 --> 00:26:06,080
50,000 times in North Carolina. Yeah. Yeah. People with Trinity. Yeah. Yeah. So it's like

607
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:12,080
a, like, um, like a girl with a nose ring who's been pregnant for like 15 years and

608
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:17,800
has like, uh, um, has like a tattoo on the small of her back that says like Brad and

609
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:22,760
tribal font. Yeah. Is there like a similar name to like Nevaeh? Would you say someone

610
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:25,760
Novea is a crazy name.

611
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:27,760
Novea is awesome. It's heaven backwards.

612
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:29,760
Fuck.

613
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:30,760
You never heard that one?

614
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:31,760
Never.

615
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:32,760
That was a big thing for a while.

616
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:33,760
Novea?

617
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:35,760
Yeah, it's like a white trash name. I think.

618
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:36,760
Damn, that's good.

619
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:37,760
Very good.

620
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:39,760
For me, it's Trinity Crystal.

621
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:40,760
Yeah.

622
00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:42,760
Crystal is just a crazy name.

623
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:44,760
Yeah, that's after the hot sauce.

624
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:47,760
Yeah. No, it's after the sliders.

625
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:50,760
What is a crystal slider?

626
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:58,360
slider. What the fuck is that? It's a food chain in the south. Oh. Well don't fucking

627
00:26:58,360 --> 00:27:02,680
don't come up in here talking about southern food chains. Yeah me and Bill are the only

628
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:08,120
southerners here. Yeah. Bill's a southerner at heart. Yes. Yeah we've talked about this.

629
00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:18,400
He wants uh he wants uh 40 acres and a mule. I want 40 acres a mule and an insane cache

630
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:24,520
of weapons yeah yeah he wants like a century gun yeah I want to die in like

631
00:27:24,520 --> 00:27:37,760
some sort of shootout with the ATF. The Aqua Teen Hunger Force? I'd love I just

632
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:45,160
Bill in America just like searching for the ATF weapons just drugs just like

633
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:50,920
Like, just fucking, he flies into Miami and just like, three hours later he's sitting

634
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:54,120
on a big throne of cocaine.

635
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:56,440
Yeah.

636
00:27:56,440 --> 00:28:00,000
A castle built of skulls.

637
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:04,200
He's like, "Come at me, ATF.

638
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:08,680
I fucking flew all the way out here."

639
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:11,880
I got a warthog from Halo.

640
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:12,880
Yeah.

641
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:17,200
Yeah. Um, Trinity, is there any good comments on that?

642
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:19,880
Reminds me of the Matrix and the Holy Trinity. Love it.

643
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:21,880
You Christian Matrix fan.

644
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:24,880
Reminds me of Christians. Love that.

645
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:25,880
[Laughter]

646
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:27,880
Love that shit.

647
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:32,880
Trinity is such a cool name. I picture a powerful/pretty girl wearing a purple dark hood.

648
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:38,880
You should definitely agree with me. Well, it's your choice. I even used this name on Builder Buddies.

649
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:40,880
The fuck is Builder Buddies?

650
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:45,440
It's like Bob the Builder. It's the Bob the Builder Battle Royale.

651
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:51,280
That would be a good game. That would be sick dude. You get to be a...

652
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:56,480
I would go crane. I would try to be a crane. Yeah? Yeah. I guess or a bulldozer.

653
00:28:56,480 --> 00:29:01,600
I'd be Bob. The thing is all of them they have they have faces so they can easily be...

654
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:05,360
you know they have brains. It's true.

655
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:09,760
I like the person who said I named my tin foil person Trinity.

656
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:11,760
What the fuck is a tinfoil person?

657
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:13,760
You never made a tinfoil person?

658
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:18,760
Why is it called... I imagine some sort of figurine you make, but why would you call it a person?

659
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:22,760
Yeah, a tinfoil being that I made.

660
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:25,760
This is my tinfoil cousin.

661
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:28,760
Tinfoil nephew.

662
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:33,760
Yeah, I don't know what a tinfoil person is. Is that a thing?

663
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:36,760
I don't know, you just make a... you know, use it like modeling clay.

664
00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:37,760
I can guess what it is.

665
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:38,760
what it is.

666
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:39,760
I'm a silver guy.

667
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:40,760
No you can't.

668
00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:41,760
You're not that imaginative.

669
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:42,760
Alright.

670
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:44,760
There's someone commented something in a different language.

671
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:47,800
I'm trying to translate it.

672
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:49,120
That looks like Polish.

673
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:51,480
It's uh, it is Slovak.

674
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:59,760
And it says, it says he read it and knows the Slovak is cool.

675
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:07,000
So on, on Trinity somebody just posted that they have the coolest language?

676
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,000
Is that a Slovakian name?

677
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,000
Trinity?

678
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:13,520
I don't think, I think it's an English word.

679
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:15,520
That's the name of their president.

680
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:16,520
Yeah.

681
00:30:16,520 --> 00:30:17,520
Trinity Slovak.

682
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:18,520
Trinity Slovak.

683
00:30:18,520 --> 00:30:19,520
Trinity Suvlaki.

684
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:20,520
Yeah, Suvlaki.

685
00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:21,520
Number six, Lady.

686
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:22,520
Nah.

687
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:23,520
Nah, it's a worse name.

688
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:24,520
No, it sucks.

689
00:30:24,520 --> 00:30:25,520
Yeah.

690
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:26,520
That's like naming your kid like, Oven.

691
00:30:26,520 --> 00:30:27,520
Man.

692
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:28,520
Yeah.

693
00:30:28,520 --> 00:30:29,520
That's like naming your kid like, Oven.

694
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:30,520
Yeah.

695
00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:31,520
That's like naming your kid like, Oven.

696
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:32,520
Yeah.

697
00:30:32,520 --> 00:30:33,520
That's like naming your kid like, Oven.

698
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:34,520
Yeah.

699
00:30:34,520 --> 00:30:35,520
That's like naming your kid like, Oven.

700
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:36,520
Yeah.

701
00:30:36,520 --> 00:30:38,520
That's like naming your kid "man".

702
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:40,520
Is that naming your kid "oven"?

703
00:30:40,520 --> 00:30:41,520
Yeah.

704
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:42,520
How did you go "oven"?

705
00:30:42,520 --> 00:30:43,520
There's a clear...

706
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:46,520
There's a clear opposite of "lady".

707
00:30:46,520 --> 00:30:48,520
I thought that was too obvious.

708
00:30:48,520 --> 00:30:50,520
So you went "oven".

709
00:30:50,520 --> 00:30:52,520
Patrick likes to go for the niche jokes.

710
00:30:52,520 --> 00:30:55,520
He's kind of a comedian's comedian.

711
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:58,520
I'm kind of a crazy guy.

712
00:30:58,520 --> 00:31:01,520
"Lady". Someone says "Lady and the Tramp".

713
00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:02,520
I love that movie.

714
00:31:02,520 --> 00:31:06,280
This is a good name for a girl dog, but not for a human being.

715
00:31:06,280 --> 00:31:09,920
Correct. I agree. That's not a human being.

716
00:31:09,920 --> 00:31:11,920
Yeah, ladies are not human beings.

717
00:31:11,920 --> 00:31:13,920
So you heard it here first.

718
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:15,920
Yep.

719
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:19,920
Someone just says, "If you say rubbish, you are rubbish."

720
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:20,920
Whoa.

721
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:23,920
And then under it, it says, "Rubbish stupid."

722
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:24,420
Damn.

723
00:31:24,420 --> 00:31:27,920
Which I like to imagine the first one came first.

724
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:28,420
Yeah.

725
00:31:28,420 --> 00:31:31,920
Yeah, and that person is just spitting in their face.

726
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:34,200
They're just calling rubbish stupid.

727
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:38,920
So the name Lady isn't very good, but how about naming your kid The Tramp?

728
00:31:38,920 --> 00:31:39,920
Oh!

729
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:46,400
Naming your kid any- honestly if you just add "the" to their name, whatever you decided

730
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:49,680
on, you're like "the Brad."

731
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:54,040
This is my son, The Brad.

732
00:31:54,040 --> 00:31:58,200
I'm naming my kid The Son.

733
00:31:58,200 --> 00:32:00,400
What about The Oven?

734
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:01,400
Now that's funny.

735
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:04,900
That'd be some nutso shit.

736
00:32:04,900 --> 00:32:06,900
Pat, you suck dude.

737
00:32:06,900 --> 00:32:07,900
No I don't.

738
00:32:07,900 --> 00:32:08,900
You suck so bad.

739
00:32:08,900 --> 00:32:09,900
Nah, you trash.

740
00:32:09,900 --> 00:32:10,900
You're rubbish.

741
00:32:10,900 --> 00:32:11,900
You better take it.

742
00:32:11,900 --> 00:32:15,500
You know what happens if you say someone's rubbish Pat?

743
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:16,500
You know what that means?

744
00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:17,500
Means you're rubbish.

745
00:32:17,500 --> 00:32:18,500
Don't agree.

746
00:32:18,500 --> 00:32:19,500
I agree.

747
00:32:19,500 --> 00:32:20,500
You're gonna have to.

748
00:32:20,500 --> 00:32:21,500
Alright, number seven is Emily.

749
00:32:21,500 --> 00:32:22,500
No.

750
00:32:22,500 --> 00:32:23,500
This is terrible.

751
00:32:23,500 --> 00:32:24,500
Yeah.

752
00:32:24,500 --> 00:32:25,500
There's such a huge drop off from Neo.

753
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:26,500
I talk shit on Neo.

754
00:32:26,500 --> 00:32:27,500
Neo is a fucking asshole.

755
00:32:27,500 --> 00:32:28,500
I talk shit on Neo.

756
00:32:28,500 --> 00:32:29,500
I talk shit on Neo.

757
00:32:29,500 --> 00:32:30,500
I talk shit on Neo.

758
00:32:30,500 --> 00:32:32,660
Neo is the only cool name.

759
00:32:32,660 --> 00:32:35,220
The reason, the thing is, there's a direct correlation

760
00:32:35,220 --> 00:32:39,580
of like cool and commonality, or and uncommonality.

761
00:32:39,580 --> 00:32:42,600
Like the more common a name is, the less cool it is.

762
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:44,740
That's why Neo is number one.

763
00:32:44,740 --> 00:32:46,940
Because there's only one Neo.

764
00:32:46,940 --> 00:32:47,780
- Well everyone is naming their damn kid--

765
00:32:47,780 --> 00:32:49,740
- And there's two Brunos.

766
00:32:49,740 --> 00:32:51,540
- Everyone is naming their damn kid Neo

767
00:32:51,540 --> 00:32:53,580
after the Matrix dropped.

768
00:32:53,580 --> 00:32:55,260
- Oh you know that's what happened.

769
00:32:55,260 --> 00:32:57,980
- The Neo boom, the Neo boom of 1999.

770
00:32:57,980 --> 00:32:59,380
- The Neo boomers.

771
00:32:59,380 --> 00:33:00,380
Yeah.

772
00:33:00,380 --> 00:33:01,380
Dude.

773
00:33:01,380 --> 00:33:03,780
There's got to be 50 or 60 of them.

774
00:33:03,780 --> 00:33:04,780
The Neo Boomers.

775
00:33:04,780 --> 00:33:05,780
That's sick.

776
00:33:05,780 --> 00:33:06,780
Just all working at GameStop.

777
00:33:06,780 --> 00:33:07,780
Yeah.

778
00:33:07,780 --> 00:33:10,500
They don't even have to apply.

779
00:33:10,500 --> 00:33:11,500
They just...

780
00:33:11,500 --> 00:33:13,820
There are diminishing returns on this list.

781
00:33:13,820 --> 00:33:17,220
I mean we start with Neo, which obviously, that's the coolest name.

782
00:33:17,220 --> 00:33:18,220
That's boss.

783
00:33:18,220 --> 00:33:19,220
It should be number one.

784
00:33:19,220 --> 00:33:23,820
Then Bruno, which I don't personally agree with, but it's at least different.

785
00:33:23,820 --> 00:33:29,340
Then we go to Holden, Miles, and then we come up with another cool one, Trinity.

786
00:33:29,340 --> 00:33:31,540
The lady, and now we're at Emily.

787
00:33:31,540 --> 00:33:33,060
Was it just gonna keep going?

788
00:33:33,060 --> 00:33:35,020
Yeah, it's a huge drop off to Emily.

789
00:33:35,020 --> 00:33:38,540
Yeah, this one has a lot of comments though.

790
00:33:38,540 --> 00:33:39,380
22 comments.

791
00:33:39,380 --> 00:33:40,620
Probably a lot of people pointing out the obvious.

792
00:33:40,620 --> 00:33:41,460
Probably a lot of people saying--

793
00:33:41,460 --> 00:33:44,260
Somebody says, "I think it is a stop it name."

794
00:33:44,260 --> 00:33:45,820
(laughing)

795
00:33:45,820 --> 00:33:46,940
And you're right.

796
00:33:46,940 --> 00:33:49,300
This is extremely stop it.

797
00:33:49,300 --> 00:33:50,700
This is dumbo stop it.

798
00:33:50,700 --> 00:33:51,860
I will say it.

799
00:33:51,860 --> 00:33:52,860
No.

800
00:33:52,860 --> 00:33:53,680
Someone says--

801
00:33:53,680 --> 00:33:55,580
Someone says, "My sister's name, laugh out loud."

802
00:33:55,580 --> 00:33:57,060
(laughing)

803
00:33:57,060 --> 00:33:57,900
Someone--

804
00:33:57,900 --> 00:33:58,740
It's just Emily.

805
00:33:58,740 --> 00:34:02,740
maybe the same guy just says she's hot.

806
00:34:02,740 --> 00:34:11,940
She's hot. Emily? Oh, Emily? She's hot. She's hot, dude. She's hot as shit. Oh my god.

807
00:34:11,940 --> 00:34:15,700
Oh, there's one comment here saying, listen to these different spellings. There's a spelling of

808
00:34:15,700 --> 00:34:23,940
Emily, E-M-I-L-E-E or E-M-M-A-L-E-I-G-H. What do you guys think of those ones?

809
00:34:25,700 --> 00:34:29,380
That is the old that is even more white trash than like crystal is like absolutely

810
00:34:29,380 --> 00:34:37,060
Trying to trying to do like like searching the way they spell their names as they search it on Google and then look at the phonetic

811
00:34:37,060 --> 00:34:39,060
spelling

812
00:34:39,060 --> 00:34:44,820
It's pig Latin they just add add vowels

813
00:34:44,820 --> 00:34:48,100
Consonant

814
00:34:48,100 --> 00:34:54,980
And this it also twin girls name them Emily and Everly or Emily and Everly or is spelled different

815
00:34:54,980 --> 00:34:57,980
Everly, can you imagine that? Everly, geez.

816
00:34:57,980 --> 00:35:01,980
What about Neverly?

817
00:35:01,980 --> 00:35:06,980
These are my daughters Everly and Neverly, they're twins.

818
00:35:06,980 --> 00:35:09,980
We like one more, obviously.

819
00:35:09,980 --> 00:35:15,980
Number 8, Jason.

820
00:35:15,980 --> 00:35:20,980
But it's spelled... Jason but spelled J-A-C-E-N.

821
00:35:20,980 --> 00:35:25,980
Yeah, no this is from the original Star Wars EU.

822
00:35:25,980 --> 00:35:31,980
This was Han Solo's son's name.

823
00:35:31,980 --> 00:35:33,980
Who later became Darth Cadis.

824
00:35:33,980 --> 00:35:34,980
Darth Cadis, huh?

825
00:35:34,980 --> 00:35:37,980
So it's different from Kylo Ren?

826
00:35:37,980 --> 00:35:40,980
Yeah, Darth Gatissss.

827
00:35:40,980 --> 00:35:42,980
Oh, there we go.

828
00:35:42,980 --> 00:35:44,980
Yeah, like Gayson.

829
00:35:44,980 --> 00:35:46,980
Gayson Holo.

830
00:35:46,980 --> 00:35:48,980
Gayson Homo.

831
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:49,980
Yeah.

832
00:35:49,980 --> 00:35:54,380
That's what I would call him if I was in Star Wars.

833
00:35:54,380 --> 00:35:57,820
Yeah, I would have said that to Han Solo's face.

834
00:35:57,820 --> 00:36:01,060
I would have said that and he would have force choked me and I wouldn't care.

835
00:36:01,060 --> 00:36:04,700
I would have said, "You're choking another man?

836
00:36:04,700 --> 00:36:08,060
Kind of gay, buddy."

837
00:36:08,060 --> 00:36:12,700
Based on Jason Solo, Patrick, is this a cool name?

838
00:36:12,700 --> 00:36:14,980
Is Jason Solo a cool guy?

839
00:36:14,980 --> 00:36:15,980
No.

840
00:36:15,980 --> 00:36:16,980
Not really.

841
00:36:16,980 --> 00:36:17,980
Cool why?

842
00:36:17,980 --> 00:36:25,860
He, um, god, what was, oh yeah, he just became a Sith Lord.

843
00:36:25,860 --> 00:36:27,260
That's cool.

844
00:36:27,260 --> 00:36:30,780
I think he was responsible for killing Chewbacca or something.

845
00:36:30,780 --> 00:36:31,780
That's extremely cool.

846
00:36:31,780 --> 00:36:32,780
That's sick.

847
00:36:32,780 --> 00:36:33,780
Yeah.

848
00:36:33,780 --> 00:36:37,040
I don't, look, I don't remember much about the story of Jason Solo.

849
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:40,260
All you know is whoever killed Chewbacca is not cool.

850
00:36:40,260 --> 00:36:41,260
Yeah.

851
00:36:41,260 --> 00:36:42,260
Yeah.

852
00:36:42,260 --> 00:36:43,260
Seriously not cool.

853
00:36:43,260 --> 00:36:44,260
Patrick is in love with Chewbacca.

854
00:36:44,260 --> 00:36:47,620
Chewbacca's cool.

855
00:36:47,620 --> 00:36:49,620
He looks like your mom.

856
00:36:49,620 --> 00:36:50,620
What?

857
00:36:50,620 --> 00:36:51,620
Yeah.

858
00:36:51,620 --> 00:36:52,620
I'm serious dude.

859
00:36:52,620 --> 00:36:53,620
This sucks.

860
00:36:53,620 --> 00:36:55,980
And he sounds like your mom.

861
00:36:55,980 --> 00:36:56,980
You.

862
00:36:56,980 --> 00:36:57,980
He sounds like you.

863
00:36:57,980 --> 00:36:58,980
He sounds like your mom.

864
00:36:58,980 --> 00:36:59,980
He sounds like you.

865
00:36:59,980 --> 00:37:05,740
Yeah, your mom walks around your house with a crossbow and shoots you if you don't do

866
00:37:05,740 --> 00:37:07,460
your chores like Chewbacca.

867
00:37:07,460 --> 00:37:08,460
That's true.

868
00:37:09,460 --> 00:37:12,460
And then she walks into her bedroom and I eat her pussy and she does the

869
00:37:12,460 --> 00:37:18,900
It's called a bowcaster you idiot. No, she has a crossbow. It's a bowcaster in Star Wars

870
00:37:18,900 --> 00:37:22,800
Yes, like she's Chewbacca in Star Wars and she's your mom in real life

871
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:25,420
No

872
00:37:25,420 --> 00:37:30,680
God you ate shit right then baby. Yeah, I did. I did. You know what it takes a big man to admit it

873
00:37:30,680 --> 00:37:34,120
Yeah, you got it. So I turned your mom into Chewbacca and then I fucked her

874
00:37:34,120 --> 00:37:36,740
You got to admit it

875
00:37:37,540 --> 00:37:44,020
I'll admit that I was wrong, but I would never admit that you turned my mom into Chewbacca.

876
00:37:44,020 --> 00:37:45,020
I did, dude.

877
00:37:45,020 --> 00:37:49,820
I went to the wig shop and I stapled all the wigs to her.

878
00:37:49,820 --> 00:37:51,560
She asked me to though.

879
00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:52,560
And then I fucked her.

880
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:53,560
No, she didn't.

881
00:37:53,560 --> 00:37:57,500
Yeah, I fucked her with my Star Wars penis.

882
00:37:57,500 --> 00:38:00,140
It's true.

883
00:38:00,140 --> 00:38:01,820
It's true.

884
00:38:01,820 --> 00:38:02,820
You can ask her.

885
00:38:02,820 --> 00:38:03,820
No.

886
00:38:03,820 --> 00:38:04,820
She'll do the noise to you.

887
00:38:04,820 --> 00:38:06,640
- Number nine, number nine.

888
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:09,840
Jen with two N's.

889
00:38:09,840 --> 00:38:11,380
- What's that other N for?

890
00:38:11,380 --> 00:38:12,220
- Yeah.

891
00:38:12,220 --> 00:38:13,280
(laughing)

892
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:14,880
- We don't need that other N.

893
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:15,720
- Yeah.

894
00:38:15,720 --> 00:38:17,200
- Come on dude.

895
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:18,040
- Yeah.

896
00:38:18,040 --> 00:38:18,880
- Why do you need that?

897
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:20,520
You don't need Jen, Jen already has an N.

898
00:38:20,520 --> 00:38:21,360
- Yeah.

899
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:23,080
- I think the top comment on this disqualifies it

900
00:38:23,080 --> 00:38:26,680
immediately, it says two of my teacher's names are Jen.

901
00:38:26,680 --> 00:38:28,720
So, if it's a teacher's name.

902
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:30,880
- Yeah, if that's a damn teacher's name.

903
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:32,000
- Yeah.

904
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,480
Yeah, again, it's like naming your kid Adolf.

905
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:36,680
You know?

906
00:38:36,680 --> 00:38:37,500
It's true.

907
00:38:37,500 --> 00:38:40,240
Naming your kid after a teacher, that's...

908
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:43,640
He did teach, you know, in a, you know,

909
00:38:43,640 --> 00:38:46,440
sort of a lifestyle.

910
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:47,900
Adolf, I mean.

911
00:38:47,900 --> 00:38:48,740
Oh.

912
00:38:48,740 --> 00:38:50,200
(laughing)

913
00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:53,520
He was kind of the, that's why nobody liked him.

914
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:54,360
He was a teacher.

915
00:38:54,360 --> 00:38:56,640
He was the ultimate teacher.

916
00:38:56,640 --> 00:38:57,480
Yeah.

917
00:38:57,480 --> 00:39:00,080
The logical extreme of being a teacher.

918
00:39:00,080 --> 00:39:03,960
yeah he was a he really kind of invented timeout now that i think about it

919

933
00:40:00,920 --> 00:40:02,920
Sometimes that's all you need.

934
00:40:02,920 --> 00:40:08,640
Sometimes all- oh dude, one time I was with this kid, this fucking weird ass dude.

935
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:15,520
We were at the beach and he was like my dad's friend's son.

936
00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:17,840
And so he was always around but he's a very bizarre guy.

937
00:40:17,840 --> 00:40:24,120
He used to- he like- we would play video games together and he would cry when he lost up until he was like 17 years old.

938
00:40:24,120 --> 00:40:25,520
So one time we were at the beach together-

939
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:26,960
You should just say it was Cameron.

940
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:27,960
It was Cameron.

941
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:28,960
No.

942
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:37,440
We were at the beach together in high school and there was some girl was like walking on

943
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:42,280
the boardwalk right next to the beach and he was like, "That girl is so cute."

944
00:40:42,280 --> 00:40:46,360
And I was like, "Cool man, you should go say what's up and get her number."

945
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:48,480
And he was like, "Her number?

946
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:49,800
All I need is a name."

947
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:53,800
*laughter*

948
00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:58,800
And me and my dad were like, "What the fuck is wrong with you, dude?"

949
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:01,800
"What are you gonna do with her name?"

950
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:03,800
"Dude, what the fuck does that mean?"

951
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:05,800
"He's gonna enchant her."

952
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:07,800
"He's Jason Bourne."

953
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:09,800
*laughter*

954
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:11,800
"Yeah, you're gonna kill her?"

955
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:13,800
"Is that what you're gonna do?"

956
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:16,800
"He's gonna do a spell, dude. You need their true name."

957
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:21,440
Yeah and her name is Jaina and he immediately got a bow hair.

958
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:25,120
Shot out of his trunks.

959
00:41:25,120 --> 00:41:26,760
He got it caught in the mesh of his trunks.

960
00:41:26,760 --> 00:41:30,160
Yeah it went through one of the holes in the mesh.

961
00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:33,960
It squished out like play-doh into a bunch of different...

962
00:41:33,960 --> 00:41:35,680
His mushy blob dick.

963
00:41:35,680 --> 00:41:39,040
"Ah, my dick fell through my quicksilvers."

964
00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:41,680
Can I get your name?

965
00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:45,460
I'm walking up to her with your amorphous goo dick.

966
00:41:45,460 --> 00:41:47,880
It's like, "I need your name."

967
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:52,760
It's detached from your body and it's sliding down your...

968
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:55,520
Don't pay attention to that.

969
00:41:55,520 --> 00:41:56,880
I need a name.

970
00:41:56,880 --> 00:41:59,120
Look, I just sneezed, okay?

971
00:41:59,120 --> 00:42:00,120
That's what that is.

972
00:42:00,120 --> 00:42:01,640
I dropped my ice cream.

973
00:42:01,640 --> 00:42:02,640
Just talk to me.

974
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:04,240
I need a name.

975
00:42:04,240 --> 00:42:07,240
It's crawling toward her across the ground.

976
00:42:07,240 --> 00:42:09,440
It's just some gum I sat in.

977
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:10,440
It's fine.

978
00:42:10,440 --> 00:42:20,840
That's my little brother, don't look at me, he loves attention.

979
00:42:20,840 --> 00:42:24,720
And don't give me your number because I don't need it.

980
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:28,240
Don't you dare, bitch.

981
00:42:28,240 --> 00:42:36,080
If you give me your number, that thing's going on your face.

982
00:42:36,080 --> 00:42:37,080
I'm horny.

983
00:42:37,080 --> 00:42:46,120
And then you scoop it up with a dustpan and walk away.

984
00:42:46,120 --> 00:42:50,680
You pick it up with one of those fish picker upper things from an aquarium, the little net

985
00:42:50,680 --> 00:42:51,680
thing.

986
00:42:51,680 --> 00:42:52,680
The net, yeah.

987
00:42:52,680 --> 00:42:56,760
Sorry, they don't have a word for that in English.

988
00:42:56,760 --> 00:43:00,720
Yeah, they deleted net.

989
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:02,580
Number 11, Clem.

990
00:43:02,580 --> 00:43:05,720
My grandma had a cat named Clem.

991
00:43:05,720 --> 00:43:09,840
So that's, I just think of a cat when I think of Clem.

992
00:43:09,840 --> 00:43:10,840
Sorry!

993
00:43:10,840 --> 00:43:13,760
Clem's pretty good, honestly.

994
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:16,000
I'd have no qualms with this one.

995
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:22,160
Someone says, someone says, "That rhino from Lazlo" and then a yum emoji.

996
00:43:22,160 --> 00:43:25,440
I don't know what that means.

997
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:28,560
I like how two people just said yes.

998
00:43:28,560 --> 00:43:29,560
Yes.

999
00:43:29,560 --> 00:43:30,560
Yes.

1000
00:43:30,560 --> 00:43:31,560
Yes.

1001
00:43:31,560 --> 00:43:32,560
Yes.

1002
00:43:32,560 --> 00:43:33,560
Yes.

1003
00:43:33,560 --> 00:43:34,560
Yes.

1004
00:43:34,560 --> 00:43:35,560
Yes.

1005
00:43:35,560 --> 00:43:37,560
Number 12, Kesha.

1006
00:43:37,560 --> 00:43:39,560
No dollar sign though.

1007
00:43:39,560 --> 00:43:41,560
No dollar sign for this.

1008
00:43:41,560 --> 00:43:43,560
Yeah, it doesn't count.

1009
00:43:43,560 --> 00:43:46,560
You guys remember if you tried to put a Kesha song onto your iPod Nano,

1010
00:43:46,560 --> 00:43:49,560
it would come up as "Kee-ha" because it couldn't do the dollar sign?

1011
00:43:49,560 --> 00:43:51,560
That ever happen to you?

1012
00:43:51,560 --> 00:43:52,560
Nope.

1013
00:43:52,560 --> 00:43:55,560
Sorry I never had an iPod Nano. I wasn't fucking loaded.

1014
00:43:55,560 --> 00:43:57,560
It was my friend's iPod Nano.

1015
00:43:57,560 --> 00:43:59,560
Yeah, I just had records, buddy.

1016
00:43:59,560 --> 00:44:01,560
I had an iPod Shuffle for so long.

1017

It's my uncle singing.

1026
00:44:35,660 --> 00:44:37,760

It says, "Worst name ever, very ghetto."

1046
00:45:30,360 --> 00:45:33,200
That's like a, formatted like a Trump tweet.

1047
00:45:33,200 --> 00:45:40,440
Oh man, could you imagine Trump calling something ghetto?

1048
00:45:40,440 --> 00:45:44,000
Oh dude, that would rock.

I haven't heard that in like forever.

1050
00:45:47,480 --> 00:45:51,920
I haven't heard someone call something ghetto until like the other day when I was at CVS

1051
00:45:51,920 --> 00:45:55,560
and they didn't have the pen to like touch like the,

you know like the fucking card thing to like sign.

1053
00:45:58,360 --> 00:46:02,960
They had like, the pen fell off, someone stole the pen.

1054
00:46:02,960 --> 00:46:07,960
So they just had like a wire with another wire poking out

1055
00:46:07,960 --> 00:46:12,840
and the cashier was like, yeah it's ghetto but whatever.

- Let's bring back ghetto.

1062
00:46:21,740 --> 00:46:28,740
yeah we're gonna get a shirt with bills face on it that's that's so good

1063
00:46:28,740 --> 00:46:30,100
out of it

1064
00:46:30,100 --> 00:46:35,060
this is a good idea

1065
00:46:35,060 --> 00:46:39,020
one getaway for it

1066
00:46:39,020 --> 00:46:41,060
this weather trial

1067
00:46:41,060 --> 00:46:44,500
this is what it would be a good idea

1068
00:46:44,500 --> 00:46:50,380
trump tweeting about like a_o_c_ and ending with very ghetto

1069
00:46:50,380 --> 00:46:53,980
but it's a compliment to it.

1070
00:46:53,980 --> 00:46:56,380
He thinks she likes that.

1071
00:46:56,380 --> 00:46:58,220
He's trying to be nice.

1072
00:46:58,220 --> 00:47:01,540
Yeah, sorry, I was trying to speak your lingo.

1073
00:47:01,540 --> 00:47:03,060
I'm code switching.

1074
00:47:03,060 --> 00:47:07,340
Shorty, you're ghetto AF.

1075
00:47:07,340 --> 00:47:10,180
There's another poem on this one.

1076
00:47:10,180 --> 00:47:11,180
Oh, hell yeah.

1077
00:47:11,180 --> 00:47:12,660
Kesha is so cool,

1078
00:47:12,660 --> 00:47:13,980
and it's never used.

1079
00:47:13,980 --> 00:47:19,140
One hundred percent. If I have a female baby, Kesha is the first thing.

1080
00:47:19,140 --> 00:47:27,240
I have a female baby. Having a female. Yeah it's like it's a line break between female

1081
00:47:27,240 --> 00:47:31,900
and baby and baby's capitalized so it is like a new sentence. Yeah. It's not even if I have

1082
00:47:31,900 --> 00:47:39,860
a female baby. It's if I have a female baby. I'm naming that shit Kesha. Oh we're going

1083
00:47:39,860 --> 00:47:45,540
we're continuing on the same thread here with number 13. It's pink. So we're doing. Same

1084
00:47:45,540 --> 00:47:46,860
- Name exact thread because there's no--

1085
00:47:46,860 --> 00:47:49,120
- Yeah, exactly, that's what I was gonna say.

1086
00:47:49,120 --> 00:47:51,480
- I found the pattern, I solved it.

1087
00:47:51,480 --> 00:47:54,780
- Someone says, "Ghetto trash name,

1088
00:47:54,780 --> 00:47:56,500
"good name for a stripper."

1089
00:47:56,500 --> 00:48:00,260
- It's different and it's not ghetto.

1090
00:48:00,260 --> 00:48:01,980
We're naming people colors now?

1091
00:48:01,980 --> 00:48:05,660
- Yeah, that's normal.

1092
00:48:05,660 --> 00:48:08,460
- Yeah, that's me having a normal one.

1093
00:48:08,460 --> 00:48:10,480
- Yeah, I'm naming my kid a color

1094
00:48:10,480 --> 00:48:12,380
so that she can be a stripper.

1095
00:48:12,380 --> 00:48:15,940
Nowadays, people want their kids to be strippers.

1096
00:48:15,940 --> 00:48:16,780
Yeah, that's true.

1097
00:48:16,780 --> 00:48:18,140
So they'll name their kid,

1098
00:48:18,140 --> 00:48:21,020
they'll name their kid Seafoam.

1099
00:48:21,020 --> 00:48:25,660
So that they grow up to be a stripper or a prostitute.

1100
00:48:25,660 --> 00:48:27,460
This is my kid, Burnt Sienna.

1101
00:48:27,460 --> 00:48:31,700
This is my kid, White.

1102
00:48:31,700 --> 00:48:34,360
This is my kid, Yellow Green.

1103
00:48:34,360 --> 00:48:37,440
Your last name is Green.

1104
00:48:37,440 --> 00:48:39,220
No, it's Yellow-Green.

1105
00:48:39,220 --> 00:48:40,060
Last name is Blue.

1106
00:48:40,060 --> 00:48:42,260
Yellow-Green, whoa.

1107
00:48:42,260 --> 00:48:44,100
Yeah, think about it.

1108
00:48:44,100 --> 00:48:45,260
I've definitely said this before,

1109
00:48:45,260 --> 00:48:47,460
but there's a kid in my hometown

1110
00:48:47,460 --> 00:48:50,020
whose full name is Branch Leaf Olive.

1111
00:48:50,020 --> 00:48:52,280
(laughing)

1112
00:48:52,280 --> 00:48:54,240
I don't know--

1113
00:48:54,240 --> 00:48:55,060
Pretty good.

1114
00:48:55,060 --> 00:48:57,500
If you can look him up, please look him up.

1115
00:48:57,500 --> 00:49:00,400
I don't know how that would work,

1116
00:49:00,400 --> 00:49:03,220
trying to Google that name, but let me know.

1117
00:49:03,220 --> 00:49:04,860
Yeah.

1118
00:49:04,860 --> 00:49:06,340
Look up Caleb's friend, Branch Leaf Olive.

1119
00:49:06,340 --> 00:49:07,180
No, he's not my friend.

1120
00:49:07,180 --> 00:49:08,460
I don't know the guy.

1121
00:49:08,460 --> 00:49:11,200
I heard about him, and apparently he's a rapper.

1122
00:49:12,080 --> 00:49:16,320

uh...

1125
00:49:19,320 --> 00:49:20,920
it's a

1126
00:49:20,920 --> 00:49:22,440
that's also a

1127
00:49:22,440 --> 00:49:24,720
spree six yeah

1128
00:49:24,720 --> 00:49:28,680
uh... number fourteen to hear it

1129
00:49:28,680 --> 00:49:30,880
now not quite as a sauce

1130
00:49:30,880 --> 00:49:36,480
that's just that's a sesame uh... it's a sesame seed sauce

1131
00:49:36,480 --> 00:49:40,960
someone says i've never heard it might be good for a book

1132
00:49:40,960 --> 00:49:43,040
yeah who's this fucking guy with the books?

1133
00:49:43,040 --> 00:49:44,040
It's Chuck Wendig.

1134
00:49:44,040 --> 00:49:45,040
It's John Grisham.

1135
00:49:45,040 --> 00:49:48,040
Yeah, John Grisham's in the comments.

1136
00:49:48,040 --> 00:49:51,920
Yeah, John Grisham, he's writing a book about a sniper named Tahiri.

1137
00:49:51,920 --> 00:49:54,440
Yeah.

1138
00:49:54,440 --> 00:49:57,840
Who kills Pink and falls in love with Kesha.

1139
00:49:57,840 --> 00:50:01,200
Someone else says simple and complex at the same time.

1140
00:50:01,200 --> 00:50:02,200
Is that possible?

1141
00:50:02,200 --> 00:50:04,200
Who knows, man.

1142
00:50:04,200 --> 00:50:08,360
I don't think Tahiri is simple or complex.

1143
00:50:08,360 --> 00:50:10,080
Just putting that out there.

1144
00:50:10,080 --> 00:50:12,560
It's not a name, I've never met a Tahiri.

1145
00:50:12,560 --> 00:50:14,200
I have met a couple Tristans.

1146
00:50:14,200 --> 00:50:15,200
Yeah.

1147
00:50:15,200 --> 00:50:16,200
That's true.

1148
00:50:16,200 --> 00:50:17,200
That's number 15.

1149
00:50:17,200 --> 00:50:18,920
I've met probably too many Tristans.

1150
00:50:18,920 --> 00:50:19,920
Yeah.

1151
00:50:19,920 --> 00:50:24,520
I knew a kid named Tristan in middle school who, and he moved away.

1152
00:50:24,520 --> 00:50:25,520
Goddamn, okay.

1153
00:50:25,520 --> 00:50:30,360
So this, this, this list has a, it has a peak at the beginning and then a deep valley.

1154
00:50:30,360 --> 00:50:31,360
Yeah, I know.

1155
00:50:31,360 --> 00:50:33,720
And then it comes back up at 16.

1156
00:50:33,720 --> 00:50:34,720
Yes.

1157
00:50:34,720 --> 00:50:36,760
And it has a pretty good streak here.

1158
00:50:36,760 --> 00:50:40,520
We have Thurston.

1159
00:50:40,520 --> 00:50:45,080
That's the name of a segregationist.

1160
00:50:45,080 --> 00:50:47,360
Someone says it's my friend's surname.

1161
00:50:47,360 --> 00:50:48,360
Thurston.

1162
00:50:48,360 --> 00:50:51,400
But they spelled sir's surname wrong.

1163
00:50:51,400 --> 00:50:55,360
It's my friend's surname.

1164
00:50:55,360 --> 00:50:58,360
Thurston, Kazdia, and Traxxas.

1165
00:50:58,360 --> 00:51:01,360
These all rule.

1166
00:51:01,360 --> 00:51:04,360
Traxxas is like a cyborg.

1167
00:51:04,360 --> 00:51:09,920
Traxxas is like a Star Trek name before they like figured out how to name stuff in sci-fi

1168
00:51:09,920 --> 00:51:10,920
like in the 60s.

1169
00:51:10,920 --> 00:51:11,920
Yeah.

1170
00:51:11,920 --> 00:51:15,520
They were just like, "We'll just name it, I don't know, or like a cleaner."

1171
00:51:15,520 --> 00:51:23,880
Take like Travis and switch one of the fucking, move the V over a letter.

1172
00:51:23,880 --> 00:51:26,120
Yeah, mirror the V. Yeah.

1173
00:51:26,120 --> 00:51:28,320
And it becomes Traxxas.

1174
00:51:28,320 --> 00:51:30,120
And someone says my name.

1175
00:51:30,120 --> 00:51:31,920
I'm not here.

1176
00:51:31,920 --> 00:51:34,080
Yeah, your name isn't Traxxas, dude.

1177
00:51:34,080 --> 00:51:42,360
Star and then Trek are back to back. Yes baby. And then fucking after that it's

1178
00:51:42,360 --> 00:51:51,400
just Sean. Yet another valley. Yeah. And then Axel. Coming back up we're on the way back up.

1179
00:51:51,400 --> 00:51:56,120
Oh another Ernesto. That's probably the coolest one on here in my opinion. Yeah.

1180
00:51:56,120 --> 00:52:02,320
I like Ernesto. Ernesto's cool. Yeah. It's like Ernest P. Worrell but like with a O.

The first comment is I testify that this game is good.

1189
00:53:12,840 --> 00:53:19,480
I'm imagining a guy named Testify going into like a black church service and

1190
00:53:19,480 --> 00:53:25,240
then just every couple minutes being like did you say my name? Did you say my name?

And I am your lawyer.

1198
00:53:52,040 --> 00:53:54,800
Number 31 is raven.

1199
00:53:54,800 --> 00:53:56,800
That's a cool witch name.

1200
00:53:56,800 --> 00:53:57,800
Yeah.

1201
00:53:57,800 --> 00:53:58,800
Yeah.

1202
00:53:58,800 --> 00:53:59,800
Yeah.

1203
00:53:59,800 --> 00:54:00,800
Sydney and Zeck.

1204
00:54:00,800 --> 00:54:01,800
Zeck.

1205
00:54:01,800 --> 00:54:04,800
That's just an Australian person saying Zach.

1206
00:54:04,800 --> 00:54:05,800
Zeek.

1207
00:54:05,800 --> 00:54:06,800
Zeek.

1208
00:54:06,800 --> 00:54:07,800
Zeek.

1209
00:54:07,800 --> 00:54:08,800
Hey, Zeek.

1210
00:54:08,800 --> 00:54:14,320
So number 39 is Sinister, spelled S-Y-N-Y-S-T-E-R.

1211
00:54:14,320 --> 00:54:18,560
I think if you're going to do those Y's, you should replace that E with a Y as well, I

1212
00:54:18,560 --> 00:54:19,560
think.

1213
00:54:19,560 --> 00:54:20,560
It's like a middle man.

1214
00:54:20,560 --> 00:54:21,560
Yeah.

1215
00:54:21,560 --> 00:54:25,560
Yeah, Sinister sounds like the Pete Best of Slipknot.

1216
00:54:25,560 --> 00:54:26,560
That's like...

1217
00:54:26,560 --> 00:54:31,280
The guy who got... he was in the original and then he's gone.

1218
00:54:31,280 --> 00:54:33,960
It's like a Mudvayne side project.

1219
00:54:33,960 --> 00:54:35,520
They all have like...

1220
00:54:35,520 --> 00:54:37,480
Like how they had Stone Sour?

1221
00:54:37,480 --> 00:54:39,640
Stone Sour's pre-Slipknot so why don't you brush up.

1222
00:54:39,640 --> 00:54:40,640
Oh that's pre-Slipknot?

1223
00:54:40,640 --> 00:54:43,840
Yup, and it's not Nu Metal so why don't you fuck off dude.

1224
00:54:43,840 --> 00:54:44,840
Get out of the call.

1225
00:54:44,840 --> 00:54:45,840
What was that...

1226
00:54:45,840 --> 00:54:46,840
Hang up.

1227
00:54:46,840 --> 00:54:47,840
Hang up.

1228
00:54:47,840 --> 00:54:48,840
What was that Stone Sour song?

1229
00:54:48,840 --> 00:54:49,840
What was their big one?

1230
00:54:49,840 --> 00:54:50,840
I don't know.

1231
00:54:50,840 --> 00:54:51,840
I really like Stone Sour.

1232
00:54:51,840 --> 00:54:52,840
Through the looking glass, well it seems.

1233
00:54:52,840 --> 00:54:53,840
Right, yeah, yeah.

1234
00:54:53,840 --> 00:54:58,840
I think it's just called looking at you through the glass or something.

1235
00:54:58,840 --> 00:54:59,840
It's terrible.

1236
00:54:59,840 --> 00:55:00,840
Yeah, Stone Sour is not good.

1237
00:55:00,840 --> 00:55:03,080
I saw that on Fuse TV when I was a kid.

1238
00:55:03,080 --> 00:55:04,080
Have you seen that?

1239
00:55:04,080 --> 00:55:09,440
I think that one is the music video where Corey Taylor is super fat and has long black hair

1240
00:55:09,440 --> 00:55:10,440
and like a...

1241
00:55:10,440 --> 00:55:11,440
Yeah, I think so.

1242
00:55:11,440 --> 00:55:14,040
And it zooms in on a ring he has.

1243
00:55:14,040 --> 00:55:17,400
I don't know if it's a thumb ring or a pinky ring, but it's supposed to be cool, but it's

1244
00:55:17,400 --> 00:55:18,400
just Spider-Man.

1245
00:55:18,400 --> 00:55:29,720
He is just like the most Reddit person. He sucks so bad. I love him, but he's just like,

1246
00:55:29,720 --> 00:55:34,600
he wears shirts that are like, Yoda thinks you should listen to Wu-Tang Clan. And he

1247
00:55:34,600 --> 00:55:38,200
like wears a fedora. He's ridiculous. I can't believe it.

1248
00:55:38,200 --> 00:55:41,640
It's funny that he is the kind of guy who would wear a Slipknot t-shirt.

1249
00:55:41,640 --> 00:55:42,640
Yeah.

1250
00:55:42,640 --> 00:55:43,640
Yeah.

1251
00:55:43,640 --> 00:55:47,080
He, um, no, it's so funny too, because he'll talk about his childhood and he's like, he's

1252
00:55:47,080 --> 00:55:51,360
like yeah when I was a kid I I overdosed and my friends threw me into a dumpster

1253
00:55:51,360 --> 00:55:58,880
and left me to die wearing like wearing like a Star Wars shirt and like doing

1254
00:55:58,880 --> 00:56:03,720
rocks fucking Star Trek hand Vulcan hand whatever it's called I don't know I'm

1255
00:56:03,720 --> 00:56:08,520
not a nerd I love doing Cameron's hand yeah it's called Cameron's hand

1256
00:56:08,520 --> 00:56:16,080
Cameron's hand number 48 is Ed Valdo oh that was pretty pretty sick there's a

1257
00:56:16,080 --> 00:56:34,520
a

1258
00:56:34,520 --> 00:56:36,520
Yeah, you could have not heard of him.

1259
00:56:36,520 --> 00:56:38,520
Yeah, you can put it back.

1260
00:56:38,520 --> 00:56:39,520
Yeah.

1261
00:56:39,520 --> 00:56:40,520
Benefit of the doubt.

1262
00:56:40,520 --> 00:56:42,520
I'm gonna name my kid "Mohamed Atta Pitts."

1263
00:56:42,520 --> 00:56:44,520
62, Mohamed, yeah.

1264
00:56:44,520 --> 00:56:45,520
Eh.

1265
00:56:45,520 --> 00:56:50,520
Number 66 is "Gabriel," which isn't that cool, but the comment is just--

1266
00:56:50,520 --> 00:56:58,520
There's three comments, and it's just, "Just Gangster Life," "Name of a thief or thug," "This is my name."

1267
00:56:58,520 --> 00:57:01,520
[laughter]

1268
00:57:01,520 --> 00:57:07,520
number number 119 is Joel and it says name of the perfect man who lost his

00:57:07,520 --> 00:57:09,840
daughter

1270
00:57:09,840 --> 00:57:19,360
