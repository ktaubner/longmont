5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Did you guys know that T-Pain can actually sing?

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,000
T-Pain can actually sing with auto-tune.

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,000
He can't, no, it's all just auto-tune.

8
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
What do you mean?

9
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Bro, you...

10
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,000
That is honestly so ignorant.

I have a tiny disc concert for you.

12
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:25,000
That is fucking so ignorant to say.

13
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,000
T-Pain actually has...

14
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,000
No, what do you mean?

15
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,000
He just uses auto-tune to sing.

16
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:33,520
he has he has a pipes for days. He's more of a robot than man. He's not a robot. He's a grown man.

17
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:38,080
He's a grown ass man. Why was he wearing those top heads? Because he was into the circus. What a lot

18
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:42,160
of people don't realize about T-Pain is when he when he did Buy You a Drink he was like 19. He

19
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:46,160
was still figuring shit out. Really? Yeah he was like really young. So he's like so when he did.

20
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:52,160
So he's 24 now? Yeah he's 24 years old. Wow. So when he did his circus thing it's like dude he's

21
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:56,880
only fucking 10 years old. Let the guy yeah just let him do his thing dude. He's trying to be cool.

22
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:58,760
- And then he did the cowboy thing.

23
00:00:58,760 --> 00:00:59,760
- Yep.

24
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:03,200
- So he did a cowboy thing, like rappers who do a cowboy thing.

25
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:06,240
Will.i.am and X-Men Origins, you ever seen that?

26
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:07,920
- I never seen that.

27
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:10,560
- Oh man, there's a really good scene where,

28
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:14,720
'cause he played Wraith and his power was like teleportation

29
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:18,040
so it's just like, Will.i.am will just pop up places

30
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:19,520
in a cowboy hat.

31
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:20,340
- That's dope.

32
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:21,180
- Yeah, dude.

33
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:22,000
- That is dope.

34
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:22,840
- That sounds cool.

35
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:24,060
- Yeah.

36
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:26,160
- I have some information I learned about myself.

37
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:28,160
Damn, I love info. Hit me.

38
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:30,160
Cameron found out his bum is small.

39
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:36,160
So I always knew, so the name Cameron, it means crooked nose.

40
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:37,160
Yep.

41
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:40,160
Okay, it's Scottish, it means crooked nose. I always knew that, that's whatever.

42
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:46,160
But I realized, I was like thinking about it, I was like, I guess I don't really know where the name Fetter comes from or like what it means.

43
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:48,160
Wasn't it, you told me it was an Ellis Island name.

44
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:52,160
That's what my family always said, but I was like, I've never looked that up. I don't know if that's true or not.

45
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:54,160
It means Ellis Island.

46
00:01:54,160 --> 00:02:01,060
and I can tell you now what fetter means what does it mean what fetter means is

47
00:02:01,060 --> 00:02:05,720
it cheese yeah okay keep going no let's let's keep going let him tell his story

48
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:11,320
Patrick no good no go do another one do another funny one okay here's a funny

49
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:15,960
one yeah means my best friend so what fetter actually means I looked it up it

50
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:22,680
means fat man my full name is crooked-nosed fat man damn that's what my

51
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:28,000
mean that's mean isn't that crazy yeah, because you're huge yeah, I'm giant and

52
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,080
fat yeah, that's the thing is it's so there are two possible meanings it's

53
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:33,840
that's the thing it's either fat man was the top one and I was like oh there's

54
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:37,160
another meaning okay. I can like this is this will save me know what the second

55
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:40,600
meaning is casual male XL a cheat or a scoundrel.

56
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:49,120
How fucked up is that if it is an Ellis Island name that means that they had

57
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:54,880
completely different name and the guy was like you are fat you're a fat scoundrel

58
00:02:54,880 --> 00:03:00,480
you're fat as shit you're a fat scoundrel and everyone needs to know and you're

59
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:05,320
like so fucked up you're the you're like that that fat guy from Final Fantasy 9

60
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:10,520
that's you which guy's that I never played the pirate ship the chef he just

61
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:13,280
said he's never played it and you're just saying more details and then and

62
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:16,680
then there's Vivi wait you might we might get it if you say a couple more things

63
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:25,960
VV the little mage. Oh no. Mage that's starting to ring a bell. Yeah. Black. Black. Okay. VV

64
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:31,120
has a black face with yellow eyes. Like a Jawa. Yes. Yeah I know what the mages look

65
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:36,120
like. Okay then we're getting a star closer. We're there we got it. I think we got it. Okay

66
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:41,160
so imagine a fat chef. A fat person, a fat chef who's a friend of one of the mages. Yeah.

67
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:45,920
Okay, I don't think they ever interact. Oh, okay. Where's Patrick going?

68
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:53,320
You had a red hit a pocket Red Bull. Yeah. Whoa, you're gonna pockets if I shown you these

69
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:57,680
Just that you have big

70
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:05,400
Okay, I get my phone out of here so you show you this might be the worst episode ever this is not ready

71
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:12,880
You can fit a red bull in your big pocket. You can fit the smallest red bull can into your pocket, but not with a phone

72
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:18,900
It's too small you can fit a Nalgene in there. Okay. Hey, you got big pocket my Nalgene out your pocket

73
00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:22,280
It's a that crazy. So get it out, dude. That's nasty

74
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:27,920
You sweat in those pants all day get that tastes like change my god

75
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:32,160
I guess gonna taste like look how much sweat filled this up. Oh my god, it's complete full of sweat

76
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:35,120
It says it has 1000 milliliters of sweat in here.

77
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:36,120
It has nutrients.

78
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:38,680
Look, you can see the dots of salt in the sweat.

79
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:40,000
My sweat, dude, I've been...

80
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
I bet your sweat doesn't have salt.

81
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:45,000
When Kai was here, Kai got me into the electrolyte powders.

82
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:49,800
This whole weekend, every time I had water, I'd put those in.

83
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:51,560
I've been so hydrated.

84
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:54,440
I don't think the electrolytes hydrate you anymore.

85
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:55,800
I think water hydrates you.

86
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:58,520
The electrolytes, it's basically just salt, right?

87
00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:01,040
Yeah, I think it's just a different type of thing.

88
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:02,040
Yeah.

89
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:03,840
different type of nutrient.

90
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:05,960
It's called triple hydration.

91
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:07,600
Can we make you a health freak?

92
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:08,880
That'd be kind of funny.

93
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:15,720
If you got into eating a raw egg every morning and you're juicing, I need to see you into

94
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:16,720
ketosis.

95
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:17,720
That'd be so funny.

96
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:20,800
Can I be your ketosis Sherpa and guide you up the mountain?

97
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:21,800
I have one.

98
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:23,560
I just don't talk to him anymore.

99
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:24,640
You have me.

100
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:27,820
I will be your ketosis Sherpa.

101
00:05:27,820 --> 00:05:29,320
You met Ron, right?

102
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:31,040
Ron, your ketosis man?

103
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:33,040
Ron my personal trainer.

104
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:34,040
No I never met Ron.

105
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:35,040
Ron Weasley?

106
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:36,040
I just stopped talking to him.

107
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:37,040
Why?

108
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:38,040
Something happened.

109
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:39,040
What happened?

110
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:40,040
It's ok.

111
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:42,040
I found him on Craigslist.

112
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:43,040
Yep.

113
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:44,040
Thought he was a personal trainer.

114
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:45,040
Ok.

115
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:46,040
Turns out he's a feeder.

116
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:48,040
This is the opposite.

117
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:49,040
Yeah.

118
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:55,480
I should have seen it coming because he's like oh you need 50,000 calories in the morning.

119
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:57,200
That is a serious red flag.

120
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:58,200
Yeah that's dangerous.

121
00:05:58,200 --> 00:06:00,620
- I thought I was doing gains.

122
00:06:00,620 --> 00:06:03,500
I thought that's what gains meant.

123
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:04,760
- You're not gaining anything.

124
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:06,960
- 'Cause I kept asking him about gains.

125
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:08,620
I think that was my problem.

126
00:06:08,620 --> 00:06:11,260
I was like, "Oh yeah, so I'm gonna get massive gains."

127
00:06:11,260 --> 00:06:13,700
He's like, "Oh, you're gonna get gains alright."

128
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:16,880
I was like, "He kinda said that weird."

129
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:18,620
- So what was that?

130
00:06:18,620 --> 00:06:20,280
- That's one of the number one red flags,

131
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:21,520
when you say someone and someone goes,

132
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:23,620
"Oh yeah, we're gonna do that alright."

133
00:06:23,620 --> 00:06:24,940
When they say alright after it, you should--

134
00:06:24,940 --> 00:06:26,840
- That's a bit suspicious, you guys.

135
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:28,540
- Also, you might be Jafar.

136
00:06:28,540 --> 00:06:31,160
- Also, you have a Jafar type quality to me.

137
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:35,320
- A 5'7", 200 pound personal trainer, that's crazy.

138
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:40,500
- Yeah, yeah, it's a bad idea to have a mirror

139
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:41,340
be your damn personal trainer.

140
00:06:41,340 --> 00:06:43,900
- When your personal trainer is fatter than you, huh?

141
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:44,740
- Nothing.

142
00:06:44,740 --> 00:06:46,440
- I'm not 5'7".

143
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:47,740
- You're right, you're 5'4".

144
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:51,380
- When your personal trainer is fatter than you,

145
00:06:51,380 --> 00:06:53,020
that's never a good sign.

146
00:06:53,020 --> 00:06:54,480
- I think that's a pretty common thing.

147
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:55,900
You ever go to like Gold's Gym

148
00:06:55,900 --> 00:06:59,020
like Planet Fitness or something they have their personal trainers who are like

149
00:06:59,020 --> 00:07:04,580
giant whales? No. They are fat as hell. How do the whales fit in the building? It's

150
00:07:04,580 --> 00:07:09,820
probably smaller than a whale. Okay I made it all up. I was lying for attention.

151
00:07:09,820 --> 00:07:14,140
Is that what you want to hear? Yeah. I do that a lot. I'm glad you admitted it.

152
00:07:14,140 --> 00:07:19,380
Yep. But I actually did go skydiving over the weekend. Oh really? Seriously? No I made

153
00:07:19,380 --> 00:07:23,900
that up. I was lying for attention. I went to New Hampshire. Really? Yeah I went to New

154
00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:27,420
New Hampshire this weekend to say no, I think you're lying for attention right

155
00:07:27,420 --> 00:07:29,900
now. It's definitely lying. You would never go to New Hampshire. It's an

156
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:35,420
obvious lie. I'm lying. How was it? It was all right. I ate two sandwiches for

157
00:07:35,420 --> 00:07:40,140
lunch yesterday. Double sandwich. Sorry, Patrick. Hold the New Hampshire talk. Two

158
00:07:40,140 --> 00:07:42,380
sandwiches for lunch? Yeah, what do you guys want to ask me a bunch of

159
00:07:42,380 --> 00:07:47,260
questions and make me the center of the conversation? Yes, yes, I do. Yeah, what

160
00:07:47,260 --> 00:07:49,340
was on the two sandwiches? Were they different or the same? Everything.

161
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:50,740
- Everything?

162
00:07:50,740 --> 00:07:52,220
- Two everything sandwiches.

163
00:07:52,220 --> 00:07:54,780
- Everything at the deli or everything?

164
00:07:54,780 --> 00:07:55,620
- Everywhere.

165
00:07:55,620 --> 00:07:56,940
- Everything, everywhere?

166
00:07:56,940 --> 00:07:58,260
- Everything everywhere at once.

167
00:07:58,260 --> 00:07:59,100
- All at once?

168
00:07:59,100 --> 00:07:59,940
- All at once?

169
00:07:59,940 --> 00:08:00,760
- Two sandwiches?

170
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:01,600
- Not like the movie.

171
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:03,540
Two sandwiches, three sandwiches.

172
00:08:03,540 --> 00:08:04,380
- Wait, you had a third sandwich?

173
00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:05,220
- It was a third sandwich.

174
00:08:05,220 --> 00:08:06,040
- You just remembered it was actually three?

175
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:07,260
- I just remembered, yeah, it was four.

176
00:08:07,260 --> 00:08:09,020
- Wow, that's so many sandwiches.

177
00:08:09,020 --> 00:08:11,180
- But the fourth one wasn't an everything sandwich.

178
00:08:11,180 --> 00:08:12,020
That was PB&J.

179
00:08:12,020 --> 00:08:13,340
- Oh, just PB&J, 'cause you were so full.

180
00:08:13,340 --> 00:08:14,620
- That's like realistic.

181
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:15,860
Or like it's true, I mean.

182
00:08:15,860 --> 00:08:16,820
- Yeah, yeah.

183
00:08:16,820 --> 00:08:17,740
- Not realistic.

184
00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:21,740
When I go to New Hampshire, my mom and dad--

185
00:08:21,740 --> 00:08:22,740
Wait, hold on.

186
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:27,740
Was there everything meat, cheese, everything in the meat and cheese category?

187
00:08:27,740 --> 00:08:28,740
Everything in the meat and cheese category?

188
00:08:28,740 --> 00:08:29,740
Every ingredient.

189
00:08:29,740 --> 00:08:31,740
Have you ever had an everything sandwich?

190
00:08:31,740 --> 00:08:32,740
Yeah, what?

191
00:08:32,740 --> 00:08:35,740
I guess, I must be doing New York wrong.

192
00:08:35,740 --> 00:08:38,740
Yeah, you go to, you say, "Ah, let me get an everything sandwich."

193
00:08:38,740 --> 00:08:39,740
And he says, "Sure, sure."

194
00:08:39,740 --> 00:08:44,740
And then he just grabs one of each of everything and then puts it onto a sandwich.

195
00:08:44,740 --> 00:08:45,740
One jalapeno.

196
00:08:45,740 --> 00:08:46,740

197
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:53,220

it yeah does that counts as part of everything if there's one already in the

203
00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:19,020
room. It's the hardest sandwich to make at the bodega, so you got to go you got to

Pat, were you he was lying because he didn't want to admit he was there.

269
00:12:31,020 --> 00:12:35,540
Pabria that's why you see now. I don't know who to trust because you tell the

270
00:12:35,540 --> 00:12:39,780
truth every single time and he's never said a single true thing. He was there.

271
00:12:39,780 --> 00:12:43,300
He was in one of the sandwiches. I really

272
00:12:43,300 --> 00:12:49,460
and I missed out on all this. You were there because you was I yeah you were

273
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:52,500
you were asleep. We stole you from your bed.

274
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:55,740
Bro, I slept through the whole thing?

275
00:12:55,740 --> 00:12:58,020
We wrapped you up. We carried you in a bindle.

276
00:12:58,020 --> 00:12:59,020
Yeah.

277
00:12:59,020 --> 00:13:00,940
Did I even get one of the sandwiches?

278
00:13:00,940 --> 00:13:02,180
You were in one of the sandwiches.

279
00:13:02,180 --> 00:13:05,140
You were in one of the sandwiches and you got to eat one crumb.

280
00:13:05,140 --> 00:13:06,140
Really?

281
00:13:06,140 --> 00:13:07,140
Yeah.

282
00:13:07,140 --> 00:13:08,140
Oh.

283
00:13:08,140 --> 00:13:11,460
A mouse from Sleeping Beauty or whatever the one with the mouses is gave you a crumb.

284
00:13:11,460 --> 00:13:12,820
A mouse from Mouse Hunt?

285
00:13:12,820 --> 00:13:13,820
Mouse Hunt, yeah.

286
00:13:13,820 --> 00:13:14,820
Gave me a crumb?

287
00:13:14,820 --> 00:13:15,820
Remember, you ate it in your sleep.

288
00:13:15,820 --> 00:13:17,420
And I didn't even get to dig your picture?

289
00:13:17,420 --> 00:13:18,420
I ate it an entire week?

290
00:13:18,420 --> 00:13:19,420
Eight crumbs.

291
00:13:19,420 --> 00:13:26,380
of them? Yeah, well, statistically you're gonna eat eight crumbs over the course of a year.

292
00:13:26,380 --> 00:13:30,460
Over the course of one sandwich? Yeah, you're gonna eat eight crumbs over the course of

293
00:13:30,460 --> 00:13:35,020
one sandwich like while you sleep. Two days ago, Phil, I'm walking him down the street.

294
00:13:35,020 --> 00:13:38,220
He's lying again. No, this is true. He's been lying about this dog for months. Yeah, we

295
00:13:38,220 --> 00:13:43,500
should get a polygraph hooked up here. You've met the dog. You've met him. You just showed

296
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:47,460
me photos you took of him on your phone. They were photoshopped. Not ten minutes ago. Why

297
00:13:47,460 --> 00:13:51,660
why would he photoshop you can tell they're face tuned yeah yeah, he face

298
00:13:51,660 --> 00:13:55,780
tuned into a dog that's that would take so long. I'll take way too long. It's my

299
00:13:55,780 --> 00:13:59,460
little cousin. I face to them into a dog. He has first, so it's not that hard to

300
00:13:59,460 --> 00:14:04,900
face. Phil, I wasn't paying attention. I was really sleepy walking him in the

301
00:14:04,900 --> 00:14:08,820
morning and he I like just turned to him and he was eating something on the

302
00:14:08,820 --> 00:14:12,980
ground and he's eating a giant pile of white powder. It was just sitting on the

303
00:14:12,980 --> 00:14:16,940
ground and I was like hey, don't do that and then he just started coughing a

304
00:14:16,980 --> 00:14:22,140
and now I just said I just some kind of wait for him to die yeah yeah probably

305
00:14:22,140 --> 00:14:27,580
poison right probably poison where was it in front of the poison store yeah well

306
00:14:27,580 --> 00:14:29,980
no I wouldn't if it's in front of the poison store wouldn't be poisoning as

307
00:14:29,980 --> 00:14:33,420
people don't won't just wouldn't buy poison and leave a throw at the poison

308
00:14:33,420 --> 00:14:36,700
yeah yeah it was probably poison they threw out cuz it wasn't working oh

309
00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:39,980
that's a really good point it's probably a defective poison yeah so it's probably

310
00:14:39,980 --> 00:14:45,020
safer dogs yeah definitely I do when I was in New Hampshire this way I got there

311
00:14:45,020 --> 00:14:52,540
and immediately, every time I go there, my mom and dad just buy me drinks. And then I ended

312
00:14:52,540 --> 00:14:57,180
up blacking out. And I woke up and I saw $50 spent on touch tunes.

313
00:14:57,180 --> 00:15:03,900
You have like a Mr. Hyde that comes out and loves touch tunes.

314
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:08,060
Dude, we went to this bar that had touch tunes.

315
00:15:08,060 --> 00:15:11,500
You turn into a jukebox monster.

316
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:14,620
I played Careless Whisper 10 times.

317
00:15:14,620 --> 00:15:16,620
That is some John Mulaney-ass shit, my friend.

318
00:15:16,620 --> 00:15:20,220
That wasn't even John Mulaney shit. I just really love that song.

319
00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:27,020
That's a great song. And then, oh wait, and I did play "Let It Rock" like five times.

320
00:15:27,020 --> 00:15:27,340
That is--

321
00:15:27,340 --> 00:15:27,820
Okay.

322
00:15:27,820 --> 00:15:28,540
I changed my mind.

323
00:15:28,540 --> 00:15:28,700
Yeah.

324
00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:29,660
And you're officially dope.

325
00:15:29,660 --> 00:15:30,700
Let me look at my TouchTunes history.

326
00:15:30,700 --> 00:15:31,900
Yeah, let's go through it here.

327
00:15:31,900 --> 00:15:31,900
Okay.

328
00:15:31,900 --> 00:15:34,300
Let's see this crap.

329
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:36,060
I can't believe you have a TouchTunes app.

330
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:36,380
I know.

331
00:15:36,380 --> 00:15:39,740
You can't send music to a bar you're not in, right?

332
00:15:39,740 --> 00:15:40,220
You can.

333
00:15:40,220 --> 00:15:42,140
That is so funny.

334
00:15:42,140 --> 00:15:42,460
Yeah.

335
00:15:42,460 --> 00:15:49,420
Yeah, if you're within range of the thing, that's not good for me to know.

336
00:15:49,420 --> 00:15:51,900
Have you guys ever used the touch tunes at Waffle House?

337
00:15:51,900 --> 00:15:57,820
Oh, I guess you can't see unless I couldn't see it unless I was in New Hampshire.

338
00:15:57,820 --> 00:15:59,660
Oh, yeah. So I was right.

339
00:15:59,660 --> 00:16:00,060
Damn.

340
00:16:00,060 --> 00:16:04,460
Yeah. Waffle House has touch tunes, but it has I've never, I don't know why I've never

341
00:16:04,460 --> 00:16:09,980
paid to play to listen to these, but it has an entire album that's just called Waffle House.

342
00:16:09,980 --> 00:16:10,300
Yeah.

343
00:16:10,300 --> 00:16:17,100
and it's got just like all these songs. It has like 25 songs and I one of them has always stuck

344
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:23,260
with me. There's a there's a are these the charges from touchstones? Holy shit dude that's insane.

345
00:16:23,260 --> 00:16:31,420
That's crazy. I think I think I was like swiping it and I was like it's not fucking loading.

346
00:16:31,420 --> 00:16:38,620
All of a sudden you have 500 credits on touchstone. I was like oh no I have to use all of these tonight.

347
00:16:38,620 --> 00:16:49,500
the time between the charges. Yeah, how much time passed between each of these

348
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:52,980
can't see the time that passed between them, but I think it was back to back to

349
00:16:52,980 --> 00:16:56,980
back. Oh man. Yeah, instantly. I wish I wish that you would like it thought it

350
00:16:56,980 --> 00:17:03,420
was back to back to back and looked and it was like like 20 minutes of so funny.

351
00:17:03,420 --> 00:17:06,020
That's so cool because I think they reach the I mean the touch tunes turns

352
00:17:06,020 --> 00:17:11,380
off when the bar closes. So you probably had 40 to 50 songs that just were

353
00:17:11,380 --> 00:17:16,500
deleted. Yeah, yeah. Because it was that was around one in the one in the morning.

354
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:22,660
Yeah, and you can't fill an hour's I mean come on. Yeah we got I guess...

355
00:17:22,660 --> 00:17:26,480
If you buy premium songs maybe. The last thing I remember... You could pay probably ten

356
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:30,340
ten dollars worth of credits to play the audio from the new Batman movie.

357
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:36,340
The last thing I remember was a screaming careless whisper and then...

358
00:17:36,340 --> 00:17:38,340
A bit ironic if you ask me.

359
00:17:38,340 --> 00:17:46,340
I woke up in my little brother's bed and then I was like, "Ah, fuck."

360
00:17:46,340 --> 00:17:49,340
Because I just realized, like, "Oh yeah, I blacked out."

361
00:17:49,340 --> 00:17:51,340
And then I asked my sister what happened. She was like,

362
00:17:51,340 --> 00:17:57,340
"Oh yeah, you said you needed to go home because you got a new hat."

363
00:17:57,340 --> 00:18:09,660
and then we left the bar I need to wear my hat imagine that also you blacked out

364
00:18:09,660 --> 00:18:14,220
and woke up in your little brother's bed is a pretty bad sentence yeah I blacked

365
00:18:14,220 --> 00:18:18,900
out and I woke up he doesn't live there anymore

366
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:23,060
Yeah, not after what you did, not a black, but

367
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:30,420
I guess when I was like like my my sister's ex had the kids and then I

368
00:18:30,420 --> 00:18:34,740
guess when I got home after they like I they found me walking out of an alleyway

369
00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:37,780
and I like found them. I was like, Oh, hey, what's up there? What were you

370
00:18:37,780 --> 00:18:42,340
doing? I don't know. And then we just walked home and then I tried to I tried

371
00:18:42,340 --> 00:18:46,820
to sleep in my nephew's like Spider Man bed. He isn't there.

372
00:18:46,820 --> 00:18:51,980
here, because I know you're going to make that joke.

373
00:18:51,980 --> 00:18:55,660
I'm not going to make any joke about a drunk uncle climbing into his nephew's Spider-Man

374
00:18:55,660 --> 00:18:56,660
bed.

375
00:18:56,660 --> 00:18:59,500
It's not going to happen.

376
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:04,780
But it's literally like a child-sized bed, and I guess I was in it with my phone charged,

377
00:19:04,780 --> 00:19:08,540
and I'm asleep, and my mom's like, "Dad, what the fuck are you doing?"

378
00:19:08,540 --> 00:19:12,740
I was like, "I don't know."

379
00:19:12,740 --> 00:19:16,900
couldn't my dad was already passed out so she was trying to lift me up to get me

380
00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:22,460
into the bed downstairs and then I woke up and just went like as soon as I like

381
00:19:22,460 --> 00:19:27,140
black like a woke up from blacking out I went back up there put my phone in the

382
00:19:27,140 --> 00:19:32,580
charger and then fell asleep sounds like you had a drinking attack yeah I did

383
00:19:32,580 --> 00:19:38,060
yeah yeah that's what happens do you just you drink that much with your

384
00:19:38,060 --> 00:19:43,860
parents Irish yeah come on you've met his parents yeah I just crazy to me dude I

385
00:19:43,860 --> 00:19:48,940
could never it's a different world they're aliens basically I need to kill

386
00:19:48,940 --> 00:19:58,020
every Irish person I thought I think we were Irish travelers there's no way I

387
00:19:58,020 --> 00:20:02,180
know but the Tom was telling me about them the Irish you guys were in South

388
00:20:02,180 --> 00:20:06,020
Carolina the ones who wear the wear hype be stuff yeah they were like Versace

389
00:20:06,020 --> 00:20:09,740
you shit I don't know who you're talking about oh dude there's six yeah dude

390
00:20:09,740 --> 00:20:13,180
there's this town in South Carolina called Murphy village where it's just

391
00:20:13,180 --> 00:20:16,880
all Irish travelers and Tom described it to me as like you mean just people

392
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:25,740
visiting from Ireland no no the Irish Romanis yeah yeah and travelers yeah

393
00:20:25,740 --> 00:20:32,460
that's the word to say yeah one and right yeah they're all inbred mm-hmm I

394
00:20:32,460 --> 00:20:39,460
I mean I'm most Irish people in the same $30 from each other for years. You can say that but you can't say gypsy.

395
00:20:39,460 --> 00:20:45,220
Most Irish people are like time travelers the way that their brains are stuck in

396
00:20:45,220 --> 00:20:49,220
the Middle Ages. That's right. Traveler is a funny thing. Does that mean that if

397
00:20:49,220 --> 00:20:55,020
somebody rips you off can you say like "Oh you really traved me."

398
00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:59,660
Yeah it's funny yeah it's it's not okay to say the word but you can say a

399
00:20:59,660 --> 00:21:05,900
a thousand mean things about them. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, I guess Tom was also telling

400
00:21:05,900 --> 00:21:12,620
me that they have like a golf tournament every year and every year it gets live

401
00:21:12,620 --> 00:21:18,700
tweeted because somebody runs away with all the money. Like somebody steals all

402
00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:22,060
the money from this golf tournament that they have. Where are they keeping the money?

403
00:21:22,060 --> 00:21:28,300
I don't know. This, what? They're keeping the money in a lockbox. Is it like a

404
00:21:28,300 --> 00:21:32,860
a cartoon the money's sitting on I think this is a cartoon town where everybody

405
00:21:32,860 --> 00:21:37,940
dresses like a fortnight character yeah probably is a cartoon you know they put

406
00:21:37,940 --> 00:21:42,940
mustard on their barbecue that night actually shut up I had it's pretty good

407
00:21:42,940 --> 00:21:47,180

00:21:47,180 --> 00:21:51,300

415
00:22:00,020 --> 00:22:00,980
Alligator Adventure.

416
00:22:00,980 --> 00:22:02,260
Awesome.

417
00:22:02,260 --> 00:22:04,100
They meant to put that in North Carolina.

418
00:22:04,100 --> 00:22:04,340
Yeah?

419
00:22:04,340 --> 00:22:05,220
But they missed.

420
00:22:05,220 --> 00:22:06,420
What about the Panthers?

421
00:22:06,420 --> 00:22:08,740
The Panthers are a North Carolina team.

422
00:22:08,740 --> 00:22:11,380
They're called the Carolina Panthers, but they play in Charlotte.

423
00:22:11,380 --> 00:22:11,620
So.

424
00:22:11,620 --> 00:22:13,700
He doesn't even know.

425
00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:17,620
I bet a lot of those Panthers haven't even gone down to South Carolina and pounded down there.

426
00:22:17,620 --> 00:22:20,020
They keep pounding up in North Carolina, pounding it out.

427
00:22:20,980 --> 00:22:26,820
Poundin' Panthers. Poundin' damn Panthers pounding out in the playoffs. Yeah. I actually don't know if they're...

428
00:22:26,820 --> 00:22:31,540
Mustard barbecue sauce is good. I bought some Sweet Baby Ray's that had mustard in it.

429
00:22:31,540 --> 00:22:37,060
No, that's not what South Carolina must... or barbecue... South Carolina barbecues, they do

430
00:22:37,060 --> 00:22:41,620
pulled pork like North Carolina, but then they... and they make the like vinegar sauce. Yeah. Then

431
00:22:41,620 --> 00:22:46,740
they add mustard to it, man. That's good, dude. Mustard... Shut the fucking... shut up. Mustard's so good.

00:22:50,740 --> 00:22:52,740
Mustard?

435
00:22:52,740 --> 00:22:54,740
You get older, you start appreciating mustard more.

436
00:22:54,740 --> 00:22:56,740
I'm older than you and mustard can suck my dick.

437
00:22:56,740 --> 00:22:58,740
Whoa!

438
00:22:58,740 --> 00:23:00,740
Yeah, you're an idiot. Crazy.

439
00:23:00,740 --> 00:23:02,740
You're stupid for that.

440
00:23:02,740 --> 00:23:04,740
You guys have to stop.

441
00:23:04,740 --> 00:23:06,740
Yeah, you have to stop. What?

00:23:06,740 --> 00:23:08,740
Yeah, bitch. Yeah, bitch. Yeah, fuck you.

I bet you put ketchup on your food.

444
00:23:10,740 --> 00:23:12,740
I don't put ketchup on my food.

445
00:23:12,740 --> 00:23:14,740
I knew this. No.

446
00:23:14,740 --> 00:23:18,520
We're not gonna do this. We're seriously not gonna do this.

447
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:20,180
I'm fat and giggly.

448
00:23:20,180 --> 00:23:21,520
He said it.

449
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:24,520
I said I'm fat and giggly.

450
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:26,520
You are fat and giggly.

451
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:28,520
I'm not fat anymore!

452
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:30,520
But you giggly though.

453
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:32,520
Admit you're giggly.

454
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:34,520
I've been watching a lot of Fear Factor.

455
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:36,520
I'm really obsessed with it now.

456
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:39,820
I saw my fear happen before my eyes.

457
00:23:39,820 --> 00:23:41,820
Saw this really good episode.

458
00:23:41,820 --> 00:23:43,820
You know how they'll do ones where it's like

459
00:23:43,820 --> 00:23:47,660
that they have like couples fear factor and like newlyweds fear factor stuff

460
00:23:47,660 --> 00:23:48,960
like that. They had one that was twins

461
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:54,620
fear. Oh for real yeah, and they were doing this challenge here. They were

462
00:23:54,620 --> 00:23:58,540
doing this challenge where they had to like dive into water and like from like

463
00:23:58,540 --> 00:24:03,840
a hell that's whatever okay and like and like collect all this stuff and there

464
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:06,620
are these two twin there. So there are these there there are a bunch of there

465
00:24:06,620 --> 00:24:09,440
a bunch of sets of twins. If you can believe it, there are these two twins

466
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:12,700
that I like were like cowboys and there were these two twins that like Mohawks

467
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:17,520
were like like punk rockers and they send the punks. They like did the

468
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:20,820
challenge. They like dived into the water and like came back and like one

469
00:24:20,820 --> 00:24:23,820
of them was like clearly just like so out of it like you just like got a

470
00:24:23,820 --> 00:24:27,320
concussion or something from it and he was like it's like oh and they're like

471
00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:30,720
and Joe run. It's like oh like how'd you do how was it man and he's like man like

472
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:35,020
when you hit that that cold water like you don't know where you are it just

473
00:24:35,020 --> 00:24:38,820
changes something about you just start thinking weird things and it's like what

474
00:24:38,820 --> 00:24:41,780
what do you, what are you talking about? Like what weird things do you think?

475
00:24:41,780 --> 00:24:46,780
I was like start thinking like man, those cowboys are pretty hot and then the

476
00:24:46,780 --> 00:24:52,300
twin is like you hit the water and started thinking the cowboys are hot and

477
00:24:52,300 --> 00:24:56,020
then John Rogan's just like okay guys, you have to leave like I'm not going to

478
00:24:56,020 --> 00:24:57,620
talk about this anymore.

479
00:24:57,620 --> 00:25:04,180
It was so crazy. He hit the water, became bisexual. He instantly turned gay.

480
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:08,900
one twin turned gay when he hit cold water. It shocked him enough that he

481
00:25:08,900 --> 00:25:12,900
and the other the other one was like what are you talking about? It was so

482
00:25:12,900 --> 00:25:15,780
funny because all the other trends are doing the show where they talk in

483
00:25:15,780 --> 00:25:19,800
unison and stuff on purpose. Yeah, they all dressed exactly the same. I should

484
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:22,960
have had they should have the sclar brothers host that episode. They would

485
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:27,380
have been on fucking fire. Yeah, yeah, I wish Joe Rogan had a twin. Oh my God.

486
00:25:27,380 --> 00:25:32,700
Oh, that'd be so cool. Jim Rogan yeah, Jim Rogan or Bo Rogan. Just a second

487
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:37,560
Joe Rogan man. Yeah. Dodo Dogan. I wonder if he has brothers and sisters. Joe Rogan? Let's

488
00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:42,760
find out. He does have a mom and dad. I mean, no way. I always assumed he did. No chance.

489
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:47,000
But maybe not. No chance he has a mom and dad. Yeah, his mom is, his mom's comedy and

490
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:50,840
his dad's pot. Yeah. Yeah, but he's basically the combination of the two. He's a hybrid.

491
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:54,760
Yeah. Yeah, he's an Indica and a Sativa. Yep. Remember when we were filming, speaking of

I'm screaming my fear.

506
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:46,400
- Can we please turn this into a Halloween horror house?

00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:48,160
- Yeah, I would love to.

508
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:51,320

510
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:57,160
- Yeah.

511
00:26:57,160 --> 00:26:57,980
- You know?

512
00:26:57,980 --> 00:27:02,460

00:27:02,460 --> 00:27:08,100
the address and I like to remember it either yeah once they leave we give them

514
00:27:08,100 --> 00:27:14,980
a forget-me-not on tour do you guys want to do that or forget me yes he doesn't

515
00:27:14,980 --> 00:27:17,620
do the million-dollar haunted house in Texas where they poke your eyeballs and

516
00:27:17,620 --> 00:27:26,140
put put calm in your mouth no no they're screaming my fear yeah my fear my fear

517
00:27:26,140 --> 00:27:29,140
I would just say my fears.

518
00:27:29,140 --> 00:27:33,140
That is so crazy that you can just pay

519
00:27:33,140 --> 00:27:35,140
No, you don't pay. It's free.

520
00:27:35,140 --> 00:27:37,140
You pay one million dollars

521
00:27:37,140 --> 00:27:39,140
You get a million bucks.

522
00:27:39,140 --> 00:27:40,140
You get a million bucks

523
00:27:40,140 --> 00:27:41,140
If you make it 24 hours, I think.

524
00:27:41,140 --> 00:27:45,140
Which is also like, I would want to sleep probably.

525
00:27:45,140 --> 00:27:48,140
24 hours and it's just like guys being like,

526
00:27:48,140 --> 00:27:51,140
I'm going to touch your penis while you sleep.

527
00:27:51,140 --> 00:27:52,140
No, they like start poking.

528
00:27:52,140 --> 00:27:54,140
Well, you sign, nobody's ever done it I guess.

529
00:27:54,140 --> 00:27:58,280
I guess or people have done it, but yeah, it's last like an hour. Yeah, because

530
00:27:58,280 --> 00:28:02,320
they like waver is just like is like we can put needles under your skin. We can

531
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:06,540
we can kill you. You can touch your private parts. It's just a waiver. Yeah,

532
00:28:06,540 --> 00:28:09,340
which like yeah, it is there is a thing in there like we can kill you. I think

533
00:28:09,340 --> 00:28:12,240
yeah, yeah, which I just don't think that waiver holds up in court. No,

534
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:17,300
definitely not. No chance, but I do want to test it by dying there. Yeah, I would

535
00:28:17,300 --> 00:28:21,620
love to shut down that haunted house. Me too. I go in there with a gun. Yeah,

536
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:26,200
there's nothing in the way I would add I would add a line to the waiver and and

537
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:29,760
that says you are allowed to shoot us and then I was signing I'd hope they didn't

538
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:33,600
notice my line I added I go and shoot them yeah it's in the way for they

539
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:41,040
there's no there's no way they had in the waiver like you can't defend yourself

540
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:46,400
you can't stand your ground in our haunted house that's yeah you're allowed

541
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:49,680
to stand your ground anywhere yeah I'm concerned Texas is a stand your ground

542
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:54,360
ground. That's true. Here's what you have to do. You have to trick them and you have

543
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:59,440
to do an Ocean's Eleven type thing where you construct a copy of their haunted

544
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:03,120
house but you put it inside your house and you trick them into going to that one

545
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:07,680
and then you can kill them in self-defense. That is so smart actually. Yeah. Yeah you weren't in

546
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:12,440
your haunted house you were in my kitchen. Yeah so I can kill you and I get a million dollars.

547
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:18,040
Yeah that is actually fucking genius. Yeah. Yeah it's called haunted house doctrine.

548
00:29:18,040 --> 00:29:23,200
Mm-hmm. It's true. Yeah. Mansion doctor. I think it's Ocean's Eleven doctor more than anything else.

549
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:28,640
Yeah it is. Yeah. I really really want to do a heist and fucking have a hot wife.

550
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:36,120
Ocean's Eleven is so awesome. You know what's really cool? What? Ocean's... Ocean's Twelve.

551
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:39,520
Just the Ocean's. Ocean's Twelve is really cool. Yeah. You know what's better than the

552
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:45,920
Ocean's Twelve? What? Ocean's Eight. I don't see that one. Just less people though.

553
00:29:45,920 --> 00:29:54,400
but they have 16 boobs. Oh so it's way more boobs. Yeah it's infinitely more

554
00:29:54,400 --> 00:30:00,040
boobs. I guess that's true. Yeah. Would that be 16 boobs? Yeah.

555
00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:04,240
Eight times? No. Are you trying to do eight times two? Yeah that's 16 Pat.

556
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:11,040
Yeah. That would only be two people. What? That would only be two of them. You think two

557
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:19,840
people have 16 boobs between them. So two people with 16 boobs. No that would no. Hold on.

558
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:26,720
I know where this is. There's no like fraction involved in this right? No you

559
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:34,600
had it you had it the first time. What fraction would there be? Well two to one.

560
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:38,320
It's two for every one person, but there's eight eight women

561
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:44,600
So it's two two for two boobs for every one woman and there's only and there's one there's when there's eight of them

562
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:46,600
So it's 16

563
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:48,880
That doesn't sound right

564
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:55,520
There I feel like there's one set of boobs we're missing it's yours. Yep

565
00:30:55,520 --> 00:31:00,840
Bitch ass well, it's mine when I'm watching it. You don't have you don't grow boobs when you watch the show

566
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:06,460
He does I saw him do it really well that would be oceans nine, then it would be 18 boobs

567
00:31:06,460 --> 00:31:10,600
They should make oh then oceans one where you're than the less you're the last person

568
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:14,600
I mean we're in there like and who's our last member yeah, and they all look at the camera

569
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:21,840
They should that should be it that should be like a like a ride at like an amusement park yeah

570
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:30,120
talk about the ride what we how we're done talking about the etra. I love the

571
00:31:30,120 --> 00:31:35,440
that was last week. It's always but it's like oh, we talk about the yes, no

572
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:40,080
shit and yeah and you're the and and it's like you're the like okay, well

573
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:44,440
he's the contortionist. He's the hacker or whatever he's the face and then it's

574
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:48,080
like oh and then this guy he's the guy who rides a roller coaster.

575
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:54,600
that's a great idea for right yeah and then you're part of it yeah right

576
00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:58,640
right there. I don't make sure you straight the guards scream when you're

577
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:02,520
upside down yeah that'll distract the guards will be here's the high take a

578
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:06,040
photo take a photo at the loop-de-loop we're building a roller coaster in front

579
00:32:06,040 --> 00:32:10,000
of the bank to distract everybody inside and then we'll go into them but we built

580
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:14,040
a roller coaster in the bank yeah in the middle of the vault and it spins around

581
00:32:14,040 --> 00:32:17,920
and we put the guards in the middle and oceans 11 roller coaster will be so sick

582
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:21,120
great idea go through the vault and stuff they should make two more roller

583
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:24,960
coasters that are not for like fucking stupid movies like Harry Potter yeah

584
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:27,880
like they should make them for cool there should be an Inception roller

585
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:35,920
coaster yeah oh yeah there should be a cerebral roller coaster yeah there should

586
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:40,240
be a adaptation roller coaster yeah you know that's a Nectar King the York

587
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:44,400
roller coaster that would be pretty sick yeah into the different world you know

588
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:47,800
The problem with that, that line would be way too long.

589
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:48,800
That is true.

590
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:49,800
Yeah.

591
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:54,000
That line, you gotta like, you know, and the car itself, it's like, how are we going to

592
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,320
fit 200 people on a fucking car?

593
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:57,320

00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:59,360
scared of getting type 2 diabetes really I'm gonna get type 1000 why are you

613
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:04,100
scared of that cuz you know it's something I never think about and then

614
00:34:04,100 --> 00:34:07,880
like then you're but you're scared of it but you'd never think about it I never

00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:11,960
think about it but then I'll eat something and then I'm like no way I'm

616
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:15,320
not there might have been diabetes on this yeah there could have been with

617
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:19,880
diabetes might have this I'm gonna have to start taking injections yeah it's so

618
00:34:19,880 --> 00:34:28,480
easy to not get diabetes okay it is all right just different food oh I'm so good

619
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:34,600
at not getting diabetes you stop eating sugar surprises that's the only thing

620
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:38,280
- The thing about diabetes is people think it's the sugar

621
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:39,920
that does it, but it's actually the surprises.

622
00:34:39,920 --> 00:34:41,120
- Yeah, you need to stop.

623
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:41,960
- Your body's not expecting it.

624
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:44,240
- It surprises your insulin.

625
00:34:44,240 --> 00:34:47,160
- The biggest surprise is the diabetes itself.

626
00:34:47,160 --> 00:34:48,320
- Yeah.

627
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:50,440
- I feel any time someone gets type 2 diabetes,

628
00:34:50,440 --> 00:34:53,240
I'm like, yeah, it's not that hard

629
00:34:53,240 --> 00:34:54,560
to not get type 2 diabetes.

630
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:57,360
- Well, that's the one you can get rid of, right?

631
00:34:57,360 --> 00:34:58,200
- I don't know.

632
00:34:58,200 --> 00:34:59,080
- No, I don't think so.

633
00:34:59,080 --> 00:34:59,920
- Which is the one that you can--

634
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:00,840
- You can prevent it.

635
00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:04,580
- But you can't cure diabetes, I thought.

636
00:35:04,580 --> 00:35:08,980
I think you just like have to stop eating like Jolly Ranchers and stuff if you're

637
00:35:08,980 --> 00:35:15,300
on the way. Yeah that's not gonna happen. I'd rather lose both. That's the thing, anytime somebody,

638
00:35:15,300 --> 00:35:18,020
it's like people, you go to the doctor, the doctor will be like you're teetering

639
00:35:18,020 --> 00:35:24,380
on diabetes, you have to stop eating a Hershey's Kiss every morning and they go

640
00:35:24,380 --> 00:35:28,940
I would rather. You think I'll do one Hershey's Kiss every morning? Yep. I would rather kill myself. I would

641
00:35:28,940 --> 00:35:34,140
rather lose both of my feet than stop eating a Hershey's Kiss. Yeah. I hate

642
00:35:34,140 --> 00:35:40,880

that happens yeah is this a nice one no that's just something one of the

703
00:38:48,100 --> 00:38:55,540
torture method the book of Stephen really book of Stephen's 33 33 33 33 and

704
00:38:55,540 --> 00:39:01,100
a third book of Stephen did he Stephen was the 14th Apostle and one of the

705
00:39:01,100 --> 00:39:05,540
commandments is respect the pouch yeah yeah yeah it's the the 14th Apostle and

706
00:39:05,540 --> 00:39:08,780
all of his like stuff was just like respect the power yeah well yeah so the

707
00:39:08,780 --> 00:39:12,660
11th commandment was respect the pouch and the 12th man was respect it mm-hmm

708
00:39:12,660 --> 00:39:17,200
And then the fucking Pop-Tarts are crazy good.

709
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:21,080
Mm-hmm. Yep. Do you remember that one part in the Bible

710
00:39:21,080 --> 00:39:25,180
where all the little people are running around and that

711
00:39:25,180 --> 00:39:29,860

715
00:39:42,740 --> 00:39:47,900
yeah it's not good yeah yeah that's why it's in the book of Stephen these are

716
00:39:47,900 --> 00:39:54,260
all the things Jesus had to fight before before he did first prestige and went on

717
00:39:54,260 --> 00:39:57,700
the cross yeah that was he did prestige in that way yeah but then he didn't ever

718
00:39:57,700 --> 00:40:02,460
like deleted his account after he respawned yeah like can't leave stuff

719
00:40:02,460 --> 00:40:07,420

said I'm gonna be president right on the book yeah that's a another as another

724
00:40:30,460 --> 00:40:38,140
verse from the book of Stephen mm-hmm it's like I mean that's why that's why I

725
00:40:38,140 --> 00:40:42,700
mean you know speaking in Christian Christian Christian mothers are actually

726
00:40:42,700 --> 00:40:46,980
they're right about Harry Potter being satanic and kind of subverting God's

727
00:40:46,980 --> 00:40:50,540
work because you know they have they have these these candies they're

728
00:40:50,540 --> 00:40:54,620
corrupting God's candies they're odd candy frog that's alive yeah I don't

729
00:40:54,620 --> 00:40:59,900
think so that's not right every flavored beans no beans have one flavor they were

730
00:40:59,900 --> 00:41:05,800
you're made out of butter. That's not right. That's not right. Satan if you

731
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:11,060
guys got sworn in appearance, what would you guys swear in on if you were

732
00:41:11,060 --> 00:41:15,300
because of the flying spaghetti the Bible Bible book of flying spaghetti

733
00:41:15,300 --> 00:41:20,020
monster? I would probably do a DVD. Yeah, yeah. Oh, we can always do a DVD of

734
00:41:20,020 --> 00:41:22,740
the Bible. We do something that's not it. Can we do something that's not a

735
00:41:22,740 --> 00:41:26,540
book? Yeah, okay, then like a swearing on a trillion dollars.

736
00:41:27,900 --> 00:41:32,300
oh that's pretty smart actually a trillion dollar coin and then you

737
00:41:32,300 --> 00:41:36,820
remember maybe like an ocean's eleven here's the heist okay you get yourself a

738
00:41:36,820 --> 00:41:42,260
job as the president right and you say I'm my religion is I'm gonna swear on a

739
00:41:42,260 --> 00:41:46,820
one trillion dollar coin you make a fake version of the coin uh-huh right and you

740
00:41:46,820 --> 00:41:50,020
have it you switch it out yeah well you have to train as a magician for a couple

741
00:41:50,020 --> 00:41:52,940
years that's fine but that's but hey that only makes you more like they make

742
00:41:52,940 --> 00:41:56,020
most presidents do that yeah yeah and then you know would be good that would be

743
00:41:56,020 --> 00:41:59,960
be a good national treasure sequel is if they had to steal the Bible as it's

744
00:41:59,960 --> 00:42:03,760
being sworn on. Oh, that'd be that'd be pretty cool. Is the Bible that's

745
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:08,960
hollowed out? You know what's inside of it? We'd we yeah, but yeah, you drop

746
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:13,840
your coin. You take yours, you take the other one and then the big the the

747
00:42:13,840 --> 00:42:16,900
coin they get they get back and the best part of the oceans movies when the

748
00:42:16,900 --> 00:42:20,760
guy realized he got ripped off yeah, definitely the guy puts the coin back

749
00:42:20,760 --> 00:42:23,480
in the treasure. He tries to put it into a vending machine and it's a yeah.

750
00:42:23,500 --> 00:42:28,500
this is not a real coin. Yeah, it says 25 cents. Yeah, well it has like you know it

751
00:42:28,500 --> 00:42:31,480
has it's like one of those made up one trillion dollar things where it has like

752
00:42:31,480 --> 00:42:36,700
a picture of Jesus on it or something. Yeah. And you fucking goddamn, the

753
00:42:36,700 --> 00:42:40,740
president got me again. And then he's immediately smited by God because it has

754
00:42:40,740 --> 00:42:45,260
a picture of Jesus on the coin. Well then hey he tries to come after you, right? Who

755
00:42:45,260 --> 00:42:51,380
are the people of the United States gonna believe? Some fucking coin monkey or the

756
00:42:51,380 --> 00:42:54,500
the president. I mean I would say they believe the president, but after

757
00:42:54,500 --> 00:42:58,540
Brandon's legion has been wreaking havoc and it's a good point. That's a good

758
00:42:58,540 --> 00:43:02,340
point. Holy land, it's kind of tough to say. Yeah, I mean it might get caught up

759
00:43:02,340 --> 00:43:06,660
in the courts. Yeah, definitely. Yeah, basketball courts, because that's how

760
00:43:06,660 --> 00:43:10,420
we're going to settle this damn thing. One on one, me versus the coin guy.

761
00:43:10,420 --> 00:43:16,260
First guy to dunk wins. I would maybe ask to swear in on my crush's hand, so I

762
00:43:16,260 --> 00:43:19,140
got to hold hands with her. Oh, that's a good idea. I would like to swear in on

763
00:43:19,180 --> 00:43:24,320
Pamela Anderson's boobs with both hands. That's how addicted to being the

764
00:43:24,320 --> 00:43:31,340
president. I am yeah yeah. What else do I want to touch hmm? No, no, not poop,

765
00:43:31,340 --> 00:43:35,440
whatever you do don't make me swear it up. I'll swear on anything, except no,

766
00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:40,800
not P, but now he's holding it to I was wearing on the damn TV remote yeah,

767
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:44,600
and you probably would yeah. You could swear on on a universal remote and you

768
00:43:44,600 --> 00:43:47,740
could do a prank where then when you're swearing and you press the power button,

769
00:43:47,840 --> 00:43:50,780
everyone's TV turns off. They can't see the rest of the inauguration. I want to

770
00:43:50,780 --> 00:43:54,860
swear it on the click remote and then take that yeah and take the click remote

771
00:43:54,860 --> 00:43:58,620
is swearing in on something is a great opportunity to steal anything in the

772
00:43:58,620 --> 00:44:02,180
world. Anything you want you build us at you it's a thing or they have to let

773
00:44:02,180 --> 00:44:05,520
you. So all you have to do is become the president. It's the easiest thing in the

774
00:44:05,520 --> 00:44:08,480
world to do is win an election. I mean my grandpa says it's the easiest job.

775
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:11,980
There is you play golf president, except for Donald Trump. Yeah, he worked

776
00:44:11,980 --> 00:44:15,780
really, really hard yeah. I mean a sleepy Joe can do it. I could do it in my

777
00:44:15,800 --> 00:44:17,080
- Yeah, exactly. - For sure.

778
00:44:17,080 --> 00:44:19,240
- Yeah, and yeah, you just have to ask them,

779
00:44:19,240 --> 00:44:21,160
like, I wanna swear in on, you know,

780
00:44:21,160 --> 00:44:22,480
whatever thing I want.

781
00:44:22,480 --> 00:44:23,300
- Yeah.

782
00:44:23,300 --> 00:44:26,040

00:44:26,040 --> 00:44:26,880
- I'm gonna swear in--

784
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:30,880

785
00:44:30,880 --> 00:44:33,120
- I'm just taking your neighbor's shit.

00:44:33,120 --> 00:44:36,680
- Swearing in on a Funko Pop of myself,

787
00:44:36,680 --> 00:44:38,600
and then they have to make Funko Pops of me.

788
00:44:38,600 --> 00:44:40,280
- True, yeah, you could ask to swear in

789
00:44:40,280 --> 00:44:42,440
on something that doesn't exist to make them invent it.

790
00:44:42,440 --> 00:44:43,280
- Oh, whoa.

791
00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:45,560

had a bloody nose in my sleep. How did your, how did it fly? Have you ever had that before?

829
00:46:38,460 --> 00:46:40,460
Bloody nose in my sleep? I don't fucking know. You get a bloody nose in your sleep and then

830
00:46:40,460 --> 00:46:43,940
I'm looking up with blood all over me. And your pillow is all covered in blood. Yeah,

831
00:46:43,940 --> 00:46:46,060
that's happening. I used to get nose bleeds all the time. Your wife's skull is cracked

832
00:46:46,060 --> 00:46:49,460

833
00:46:49,460 --> 00:46:55,620
man, I get a bloody nose in my sleep and then my damn horse head in my bed is like. I hate

834
00:46:55,620 --> 00:47:00,700
when my wife's skull cracks open in her sleep and all her ideas and dreams come out. Yeah

835
00:47:00,700 --> 00:47:01,820
And they go into my damn head.

836
00:47:01,820 --> 00:47:04,500
Yeah, and I'm dreaming about princesses and a pink car.

837
00:47:04,500 --> 00:47:05,700
All this damn dumb girl crap.

838
00:47:05,700 --> 00:47:10,060
All my wife's dreams pop into my head, and then, "Oh, look, I'm buying an Easy-Bake

839
00:47:10,060 --> 00:47:11,660
oven on Amazon the next day."

840
00:47:11,660 --> 00:47:14,740
Hey, baby, did you, like, enter my brain at night or something?

841
00:47:14,740 --> 00:47:18,340
Because I seriously had a dream that I was in a girl's body.

842
00:47:18,340 --> 00:47:20,460
I had a dream I have to stop sleeping next to you.

843
00:47:20,460 --> 00:47:22,180
Yeah, so I have to stop sleeping next to you.

844
00:47:22,180 --> 00:47:24,580
I'm going to go get a hotel by myself.

845
00:47:24,580 --> 00:47:26,900
I had a dream I was a woman and I was married to a man.

846
00:47:26,900 --> 00:47:30,380
Yep, so you must have done something to my brain, you tricky succubus.

847
00:47:30,380 --> 00:47:38,060
you witch you witch witch woman you which I would what didn't it but then many

848
00:47:38,060 --> 00:47:41,740

You must be a what is this?

What are these things?

855
00:48:02,180 --> 00:48:06,080
Okay, so you are basically obviously a witch you're a rock monster.

856
00:48:06,080 --> 00:48:07,680
You have rocks for parents.

857
00:48:07,680 --> 00:48:08,980
Something is wrong with you.

858
00:48:08,980 --> 00:48:09,980
Okay, you're crazy.

859
00:48:09,980 --> 00:48:11,880
Wait, your parents are two jars.

860
00:48:11,880 --> 00:48:13,580
That doesn't make any damn sense.

861
00:48:13,580 --> 00:48:16,480
What is this two jars with tons of pepper in them?

862
00:48:16,480 --> 00:48:18,780
The hell all right.

863
00:48:18,780 --> 00:48:19,880
I'm making brisket.

864
00:48:21,480 --> 00:48:26,480
jars making brisket with the pepper in those in your parents yeah I found out

865
00:48:26,480 --> 00:48:30,240
or like yeah or like she's like I'd like it's a witch you like you to meet her

866
00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:40,400
parents and she takes you to the urns and they're empty you're like oh no I

867
00:48:40,400 --> 00:48:44,040
found out that you were your parents were pepper and then I smoked a brisket

868
00:48:44,040 --> 00:48:48,120
in it now I'm seeing your mom and dad everywhere like how high okay I thought

869
00:48:48,120 --> 00:48:51,880
I thought that that was seriously just fancy cat litter and I've always

870
00:48:51,880 --> 00:48:56,120
wanted to know what it was like to use cat litter on a brisket on a brisket.

871
00:48:56,120 --> 00:48:58,520
I was doing a Google Foods experiment.

872
00:48:58,520 --> 00:49:02,120
Oh my bad. I thought that was butt powder.

873
00:49:02,120 --> 00:49:07,880
Thought that was just tons of trash. I just threw it away.

874
00:49:07,880 --> 00:49:12,200
Oh, I was using that on my butt. I basically fed all that to my fish.

875
00:49:13,720 --> 00:49:20,440
I was thinking like if like the if I was if I woke up in my apartment and I saw

876
00:49:20,440 --> 00:49:23,640
like a hot dog on the ceiling, I would spend all day jumping up trying to get

877
00:49:23,640 --> 00:49:24,640
it with my mouth.

878
00:49:24,640 --> 00:49:29,300
I don't think fishes are wrong for that at all. Okay, I didn't know what the

879
00:49:29,300 --> 00:49:33,280
connection was to what we're talking about. I thought you were just like

880
00:49:33,280 --> 00:49:35,720
yeah. I was thinking the other day. If there was a hot dog on top of my

881
00:49:35,720 --> 00:49:41,080
ceiling, I would be I was I was thinking about that dude Fisher. I mean yeah, of

882
00:49:41,120 --> 00:49:43,980
of course you eat the food. I mean, well, so I mean I don't know maybe it's just a

883
00:49:43,980 --> 00:49:46,820
me thing, but I before I've looked at a fish like eating food, I'd be like what

884
00:49:46,820 --> 00:49:50,400
an idiot. What an idiot for eating food? Well, yeah, it's just has to swim. It

885
00:49:50,400 --> 00:49:54,020
just he looks so dumb doing it looking from the outside. I don't understand

886
00:49:54,020 --> 00:49:57,000
your perspective here. I don't think my perspective is outside the tank. So

887
00:49:57,000 --> 00:50:00,640
previously you thought that fish were stupid for eating food. It's the same.

888
00:50:00,640 --> 00:50:05,220
No, it's the same any any any pet. But if a hot dog was on the ceiling, yeah, any

889
00:50:05,220 --> 00:50:11,060
pet, I feel like is has it's looks stupid eating its food. Why? Because you

890
00:50:11,080 --> 00:50:15,120
give them the food and they eat it and they choke on it. They can't be what

891
00:50:15,120 --> 00:50:21,480
I'm not talking about dogs. You're sounding like him now. No, I'm not. This

892
00:50:21,480 --> 00:50:25,280
is a Patrick point that you're making. No, it's not. He's making perfect sense.

893
00:50:25,280 --> 00:50:30,920
That's that is only helping my case. No, it's just okay. You think that the way

894
00:50:30,920 --> 00:50:34,960
that look when they the way the way that a dog eats food. If I ate food like a

895
00:50:34,960 --> 00:50:40,080
dog ate food, I think I would that I would have no dignity out of a bowl out

896
00:50:40,100 --> 00:50:43,620
if somebody put a bowl down the ground i ran over and started a snare for you

897
00:50:43,620 --> 00:50:45,440
down here in a restaurant

898
00:50:45,440 --> 00:50:48,580
i don't do that i don't do that at restaurants that'll put a bowl in front

899
00:50:48,580 --> 00:50:51,060
of you and i don't think so fast and i don't like

900
00:50:51,060 --> 00:50:52,700
they don't have hands

901
00:50:52,700 --> 00:50:56,660
of course i have hands at restaurants are they don't dogs don't have hands of

902
00:50:56,660 --> 00:51:00,900
course i don't get out of the united well they could at least eat slowly with

903
00:51:00,900 --> 00:51:02,260
dignity

904
00:51:02,260 --> 00:51:04,740
there's still there's a disconnect here

905
00:51:04,740 --> 00:51:07,580
do you think it's a dignity issue definitely a fellow federal and i'm

906
00:51:07,580 --> 00:51:10,080
sometimes food with no dignity. No fish

907
00:51:10,080 --> 00:51:13,380
eats food with more dignity than a dog,

908
00:51:13,380 --> 00:51:15,380
but less than a human unless they're

909
00:51:15,380 --> 00:51:17,780
eating a hot dog. Let's love a human.

910
00:51:17,780 --> 00:51:19,280
Yeah. Well, no what I'm saying is I was

911
00:51:19,280 --> 00:51:21,080
thinking that a fish a fish didn't have

912
00:51:21,080 --> 00:51:22,480
dignity eating and then I was like

913
00:51:22,480 --> 00:51:23,480
thought of thinking about it and I was

914
00:51:23,480 --> 00:51:24,880
like no, I guess that's probably the

915
00:51:24,880 --> 00:51:26,580
most dignified way. They could do it a

916
00:51:26,580 --> 00:51:28,580
dog could eat more dignified. How would

917
00:51:28,580 --> 00:51:30,080
you feed a dog in a more dignified

918
00:51:30,080 --> 00:51:31,380
manner if it walked over to the food

919
00:51:31,380 --> 00:51:33,280
slowly and it took one bite and shoot

920
00:51:33,280 --> 00:51:34,380
it and swallowed it and then took

921
00:51:34,380 --> 00:51:36,880
another bite instead of going. I think

922
00:51:36,880 --> 00:51:41,880
you had a pet pig instead of a dog because my dog pretty much my dog eats slowly

923
00:51:41,880 --> 00:51:45,680
will you feed your dog like slime out of your hand that's not true it's completely

924
00:51:45,680 --> 00:51:49,640
you told me that he eat now no he's eating out of a bowl I've seen you feed

925
00:51:49,640 --> 00:51:53,400
your that has changed in the last like 24 hours then nope yeah nope it's been

926
00:51:53,400 --> 00:51:58,520
he gets he gets like a he cooks a little bit of like duck or something no my

927
00:51:58,520 --> 00:52:02,560
daughter in his hand and then he does I mean squeezes it through the gaps in his

928
00:52:02,560 --> 00:52:05,240
He uses it to get the juice out and then gives it to his dog.

929
00:52:05,240 --> 00:52:06,240
He makes kibble with pumpkin and chicken.

930
00:52:06,240 --> 00:52:08,240
He cooks the kibble in an easy bake oven.

931
00:52:08,240 --> 00:52:09,240
You're feeding your dog kibble?

932
00:52:09,240 --> 00:52:10,240
That's not good for him.

933
00:52:10,240 --> 00:52:14,840
But with pumpkin and chicken because he has digestive issues, okay?

934
00:52:14,840 --> 00:52:19,400
And he has a slight, every morning if he eats just kibble he has a diarrhea that is purely

935
00:52:19,400 --> 00:52:21,000
snot and it looks like it came out of his nose.

936
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:22,880
Then why are you feeding him the kibble anyway?

937
00:52:22,880 --> 00:52:26,640
Because if you feed him a little bit of kibble he gets his grains.

938
00:52:26,640 --> 00:52:28,240
Just put a piece of bread in it.

939
00:52:28,240 --> 00:52:30,120
He can't eat bread.

940
00:52:30,120 --> 00:52:31,120
This guy's a Michelle Obama for dogs.

941
00:52:31,120 --> 00:52:37,360
So Obama for dogs. He can't eat croutons because they're crunchy. Yeah? Yeah. So just put, just

942
00:52:37,360 --> 00:52:42,360
make your dog a salad every morning. Make your dog a chicken Caesar salad. Okay. Alright,

943
00:52:42,360 --> 00:52:47,640
I'll start doing that. That's a great idea. Uh huh. A table side? Yeah, a table side. A

944
00:52:47,640 --> 00:52:51,880
table side where I skin the anchovy and. Yeah, you make the sauce yourself. That's a good

945
00:52:51,880 --> 00:52:55,480
idea. Yeah. I did that in an episode of Kitchen Nightmares I was watching. It's kind of fucking

946
00:52:55,480 --> 00:53:01,080
gross that there's fish in Caesar salad. That's fine. You know Caesar salad made by a guy named

947
00:53:01,080 --> 00:53:05,880
Caesar the squishy squisher fish or in a Caesar show visa and it's a show these

948
00:53:05,880 --> 00:53:11,940
and sardines are so good yeah but a squisher they squish it they squish the

949
00:53:11,940 --> 00:53:16,520
whole thing and turn it into much yeah they don't they don't watch it I was

950
00:53:16,520 --> 00:53:21,240
watching an episode of kitchen nightmares where the it's like a place

951
00:53:21,240 --> 00:53:25,280
in Boston where the guy is making Caesar salads an Italian place that they're

952
00:53:25,280 --> 00:53:30,520
making Caesar salad table side which is here's a kitchen I'm a Caesar salad

953
00:53:30,520 --> 00:53:33,080
- I have a cafeteria in my middle school.

954
00:53:33,080 --> 00:53:35,920
I'm completely naked and I'm fighting Reptar.

955
00:53:35,920 --> 00:53:36,920
- Wow.

956
00:53:36,920 --> 00:53:38,020
- He can fit in there?

957
00:53:38,020 --> 00:53:38,860
- Yeah, he's a toy.

958
00:53:38,860 --> 00:53:39,700
- What's a big cafeteria?

959
00:53:39,700 --> 00:53:40,800
- He's a toy, asshole.

960
00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:41,640
- So he's toy-sized.

961
00:53:41,640 --> 00:53:42,480
- He's a giant.

962
00:53:42,480 --> 00:53:44,680
- No, the toy Reptar.

963
00:53:44,680 --> 00:53:45,880
- Well, you didn't say that.

964
00:53:45,880 --> 00:53:47,440
- Yeah, because I thought it was obvious.

965
00:53:47,440 --> 00:53:48,760
- Oh, so you're Tommy Pickles.

966
00:53:48,760 --> 00:53:50,040
- It should be obvious then.

967
00:53:50,040 --> 00:53:51,720
- No, I'm me and I'm in my middle school

968
00:53:51,720 --> 00:53:53,200
and I'm naked and I'm in the kitchen.

969
00:53:53,200 --> 00:53:55,240
- So you're naked at your middle school?

970
00:53:55,240 --> 00:53:57,760
- Yeah, as a middle schooler fighting a Reptar.

971
00:53:57,760 --> 00:53:58,960
- Okay.

972
00:53:58,960 --> 00:54:03,200
anyway the Kitchen Nightmares episode is in Boston and there's a scene where

973
00:54:03,200 --> 00:54:07,240
Gordon Ramsay is- Oh the toy Gordon Ramsay right? Yeah the toy Gordon Ramsay. Yeah of course.

974
00:54:07,240 --> 00:54:12,920
But he's in front of he's in front of the Sephora in Faneuil Hall. Uh-huh.

975
00:54:12,920 --> 00:54:19,840
He's like, "I need to go to the North End. The only way to do it is

976
00:54:19,840 --> 00:54:25,760
by one of these." And he gets on a fucking duck boat. He's in front of the fucking

977
00:54:25,760 --> 00:54:30,480
Sephora in Faneuil Hall and he has to go to the North End. He gets on the duck boat at

978
00:54:30,480 --> 00:54:34,520
the park? He gets on the duck boat or he's like I need a quick history lesson and he

979
00:54:34,520 --> 00:54:39,160
gets on the boat and he's like hey Gordon where you going? He's like I'm

980
00:54:39,160 --> 00:54:42,800
going to the North End. Wait one of the ones that's a that's has the it's like a

981
00:54:42,800 --> 00:54:47,240
car and a boat? Yeah. And then he gets on it and the guy's like telling

982
00:54:47,240 --> 00:54:52,600
him like yeah the North End's one of the it's got the most Italians in all of

983
00:54:52,600 --> 00:54:59,640
Boston and then it's like I mapped it out from that Sephora to this restaurant

984
00:54:59,640 --> 00:55:04,520
it's about a four minute walk it's a four minute walk it is a - it is a one to

985
00:55:04,520 --> 00:55:08,400
two minute drive depending on traffic Gordon Ramsay gets on there's two

986
00:55:08,400 --> 00:55:13,180
streets between the earth and then that's a four yeah there the he gets on

987
00:55:13,180 --> 00:55:17,300
the duck boat for one minute to hear this like fucking Boston guy just be

988
00:55:17,300 --> 00:55:23,980
like yeah there's a lot of Italians here I mean he needed a history lesson he said

989
00:55:23,980 --> 00:55:27,680
it you could have walked I'll be sorry at the time

990
00:55:27,680 --> 00:55:32,520
Menino man you know I don't need big I don't know man you know mm-hmm the

992
00:55:39,220 --> 00:55:43,900
if Gordon Ramsay commandeered my duck boat dude if Gordon Ramsay was probably

993
00:55:43,900 --> 00:55:49,340
try to confit yeah oh my god if Gordon Ramsay was in Boston if I see him in Boston

994
00:55:49,340 --> 00:55:54,900
I'd probably try to put sauce on it. I'd probably put a brown sauce all over my damn duck boat.

995
00:55:54,900 --> 00:56:01,020
Oh you want to put gravy on my duck boat? Yeah asshole. Yeah I'm gonna put sauce on it I'm

997
00:56:06,580 --> 00:56:11,580
cutting it I'll just how do I turn this into foie gras

998
00:56:11,580 --> 00:56:13,580
foie gras

999
00:56:13,580 --> 00:56:15,580
foie gras

1000
00:56:15,580 --> 00:56:17,580
foie gras

1001
00:56:17,580 --> 00:56:22,580
I would love to see a TV show of Gordon Ramsay eating inedible objects and

1002
00:56:22,580 --> 00:56:25,580
complaining about like eating like like duct tape or something

1003
00:56:25,580 --> 00:56:26,580
you haven't seen

1004
00:56:26,580 --> 00:56:28,580
fucking hell it's too sticky

1005
00:56:28,580 --> 00:56:30,580
oh fucking hell

1006
00:56:30,580 --> 00:56:32,580
fucking hell it's too silver

1007
00:56:32,580 --> 00:56:34,580
what the fuck what is this

1008
00:56:34,580 --> 00:56:39,540
nice. Yeah, this is a fucking sponge. This is fucking Crayon. This is a

1009
00:56:39,540 --> 00:56:43,700
fucking blue spot. Are you going to sell? He's he's at he's at a

1010
00:56:43,700 --> 00:56:47,860
restaurant in the kitchen at a restaurant like eating the plates.

1011
00:56:47,860 --> 00:56:52,580
It's fucking it's stale. This is fucking broken. I would literally

1012
00:56:52,580 --> 00:56:55,700
only watch that for the rest of my life. If you just eat it, just

1013
00:56:55,700 --> 00:56:59,380
him reviewing the food on fear factor. Yeah, pig come in blood

1014
00:56:59,380 --> 00:57:02,020
and he's like putting his hands and he's like fuck me. Look at

1015
00:57:02,020 --> 00:57:06,380
this look at this would you you would you sell these gonads would you sell these

1016
00:57:06,380 --> 00:57:10,940
these alligator eyeballs are fucking no fucking seasoning he comes up to Joe

1017
00:57:10,940 --> 00:57:15,660
Ruggs like this is chef I need you to taste this me it's like one of the

1018
00:57:15,660 --> 00:57:20,220
donkey dicks and Jerry's like I'm not gonna eat that if you wouldn't need it

1019
00:57:20,220 --> 00:57:25,300
why are you serving to these people it's a good point yeah fair point about show

1020
00:57:25,300 --> 00:57:28,740
Joe Rogan chef to do every part of the eating definitely you have to do

1021
00:57:28,740 --> 00:57:32,500
everything with them dude if he's if he's the best he's the best reality TV host

1022
00:57:32,500 --> 00:57:35,980
because he looks like he's never done anything in his life he looks like he

1023
00:57:35,980 --> 00:57:39,540
woke up that morning like he spawned that morning it's like an animal from a

1024
00:57:39,540 --> 00:57:44,280
bowling ball and he's so awesome he just I saw I saw an episode the other day

1025
00:57:44,280 --> 00:57:48,060
where he just had his head he just had like a growth on his lip like he just

1026
00:57:48,060 --> 00:57:53,980
had a disgusting and they did not do it which is okay and cool if Joe Rogan

1027
00:57:53,980 --> 00:57:58,080
wants to have us on the oh yeah I mean I love he's the but he literally is the

1028
00:57:58,080 --> 00:58:02,960
perfect like game show reality show. I think we could get on. I think we get on easy.

1029
00:58:02,960 --> 00:58:07,360
That'd be so funny to get on there and try to like explain something that doesn't exist to him

1030
00:58:07,360 --> 00:58:12,560
that we made up like us trying to like talk to. You really you want to troll Joe Rogan? I don't

1031
00:58:12,560 --> 00:58:18,720
want to troll him. You seriously why? Why would you do that? I want him to think about experimental

1032
00:58:18,720 --> 00:58:26,000
concepts. Like what? Like basically like what like okay think about like the fastest car.

1033
00:58:27,200 --> 00:58:30,480
to Tesla Model S. 0-60 in 1.6 seconds.

1034
00:58:30,480 --> 00:58:34,400
Yeah, think about that. Now imagine it had the engine of two of them.

1035
00:58:34,400 --> 00:58:38,560
So it had two engines

1036
00:58:38,560 --> 00:58:43,200
inside of it. It had two ones of the engine.

1037
00:58:43,200 --> 00:58:46,840
So this is the concept you want to ask him about.

1038
00:58:46,840 --> 00:58:50,800
Yeah, I think he probably would have some good insight on that I have to say.

1039
00:58:50,800 --> 00:58:54,000
He probably would. If there was two ones of one car.

1040
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:59,480
I think honestly Patrick, I think you and Joe Rogan head to head, he's tearing you up in

1041
00:58:59,480 --> 00:59:00,480
the mental arena.

1042
00:59:00,480 --> 00:59:01,840
In the mental arena?

1043
00:59:01,840 --> 00:59:02,840
Yeah.

1044
00:59:02,840 --> 00:59:05,160
What about the pasta dutchie arena?

1045
00:59:05,160 --> 00:59:08,120
I bet he can smoke you under the damn table too.

1046
00:59:08,120 --> 00:59:09,960
I bet he can't drink as many beers as me.

1047
00:59:09,960 --> 00:59:12,680
I bet he can't drink twice as many beers as you.

1048
00:59:12,680 --> 00:59:14,220
There's only one way to find this out.

1049
00:59:14,220 --> 00:59:19,040
I think you need to go on and have an eating challenge/smoking challenge/drinking challenge/mental

1050
00:59:19,040 --> 00:59:20,040
challenge.

1051
00:59:20,040 --> 00:59:22,720
So I'm going to eat a bunch of Delta 8 gummies.

1052
00:59:22,720 --> 00:59:23,560
- No, not Delta 8.

1053
00:59:23,560 --> 00:59:25,520
- No, no, no, I eat the Delta 8.

1054
00:59:25,520 --> 00:59:27,640
- He does use CBD therapeutically though.

1055
00:59:27,640 --> 00:59:28,480
- Me?

1056
00:59:28,480 --> 00:59:29,300
- He does.

1057
00:59:29,300 --> 00:59:30,920
- Oh, I started because of him.

1058
00:59:30,920 --> 00:59:32,960
- Doing CBD because of Joe Rogan?

1059
00:59:32,960 --> 00:59:33,960
- Yeah, for my back.

1060
00:59:33,960 --> 00:59:36,780
My back problems.

1061
00:59:36,780 --> 00:59:39,280
I have back pain constantly.

1062
00:59:39,280 --> 00:59:41,040
- Every time you turn your back to me it's a problem.

1063
00:59:41,040 --> 00:59:42,200
Get your fine ass back over here.

1064
00:59:42,200 --> 00:59:43,680
- No.

1065
00:59:43,680 --> 00:59:44,600
- Sit in my lap.

1066
00:59:44,600 --> 00:59:45,440
- Okay.

1067
00:59:45,440 --> 00:59:47,280
- What?

1068
00:59:47,280 --> 00:59:48,120
- Huh?

1069
00:59:48,120 --> 00:59:49,560
- That's the sound it made when you sat on my lap.

1070
00:59:49,560 --> 00:59:50,400
- That's a weird sound.

1071
00:59:50,400 --> 00:59:51,240
- What the hell?

1072
00:59:51,240 --> 00:59:52,080
- Why'd it do that?

1073
00:59:52,080 --> 00:59:54,800
That sounded like you were standing up more than sitting down.

1074
00:59:54,800 --> 00:59:56,300
Yeah, that's a classic stand up sound.

1075
00:59:56,300 --> 00:59:58,300
Yeah, as your butt is stuck to the chair.

1076
00:59:58,300 --> 00:59:59,300
Let me sit down.

1077
00:59:59,300 --> 01:00:00,300
Huh.

1078
01:00:00,300 --> 01:00:03,300
Oh, there goes my penis into his butt.

1079
01:00:03,300 --> 01:00:04,300
Ouch!

1080
01:00:04,300 --> 01:00:05,300
Ouch!

1081
