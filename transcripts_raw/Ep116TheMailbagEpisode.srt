00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
You're listening to Israel's number one podcast.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,580
(upbeat music)

3
00:00:06,580 --> 00:00:11,180
- You really crap monster.

4
00:00:11,180 --> 00:00:12,020
(laughing)

5
00:00:12,020 --> 00:00:12,840
(explosion)

6
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:13,680
- Wow.

7
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:14,740
- Yes, you guys have never, you've never,

8
00:00:14,740 --> 00:00:16,080
you've never tried jacking off during one

9
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:17,000
of these Zoom episodes?

10
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:17,840
- No.

11
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:19,460
- No.

12
00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:20,840
- There's no way you could.

13
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:21,680
- No.

14
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:22,720
- I mean, you could.

15
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:23,560
- It's just we find that pretty easy.

16
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:25,200
- Are you issuing a challenge to me?

17
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:26,880
How would you find that out?

18
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:27,700
How would you know?

19
00:00:27,700 --> 00:00:29,040
You don't know what my coming

20
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:31,040
and jacking off face to face.

21
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:34,040
Just a fountain of white liquid just shooting up for one second.

22
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:36,040
Oh my god, I spilled my milk on the ceiling.

23
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:37,040
Oh no!

24
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:41,040
A bug just splattered upwards on my camera.

25
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:43,040
I crushed a bug upside down.

26
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:44,040
A big white bug.

27
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:46,040
A bug just flew into my mouth.

28
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:47,040
Mmm!

29
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:48,040
Mmm!

30
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:49,040
Mmm!

31
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:50,040
I might have to...

32
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:51,040
Oh, man!

33
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:53,040
Imagine if this bug was covered in chocolate.

34
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:56,040
I'm gonna take another bite of this bug if you give me ten minutes.

35
00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:58,300
(laughing)

36
00:00:58,300 --> 00:01:01,580
- Right, yeah, no, for the rest of the episode.

37
00:01:01,580 --> 00:01:03,840
- I'm trying to catch the bug, it's really fast.

38
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:04,680
- The rest of the episode came--

39
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:06,400
- I have to move my hand around really fast

40
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:07,680
to try to catch the bug.

41
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:09,840
- Oh, he's, oh, I almost caught him!

42
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:12,080
(laughing)

43
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:13,400
- Oh, I just caught the bug.

44
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:15,280
- Oh man, was that--

45
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:16,760
- And I got the bug juice.

46
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:19,280
- Was catching that bug as good as it was for you guys

47
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:20,120
as it was for me?

48
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:21,560
(laughing)

49
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:28,560
I know somebody who I used to be homeschooled with one time while we were being homeschooled

50
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:35,460
jacked off on my couch with a blanket over him.

51
00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:36,460
That's disgusting.

52
00:01:36,460 --> 00:01:37,680
Yeah, it was pretty gross.

53
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:39,680
Yeah, did you call him out on it?

54
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:42,240
Yeah, dude, I ripped the blanket off.

55
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:45,320
It's crazy how comfortable kids are with each other.

56
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:47,560
Especially homeschool kids, dude.

57
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:48,560
We're freaks.

58
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:51,320
- Kids used to just be like,

59
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:54,200
okay, I'm gonna go jack off in your guest room now.

60
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:55,040
- Yeah. - Oh my God.

61
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:56,200
The amount of times where I was like,

62
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:57,720
hey man, I'm gonna go to your bathroom

63
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:58,920
and I'm going to jack off.

64
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:01,420
- I was never a kid who would jack off

65
00:02:01,420 --> 00:02:02,440
at someone else's home.

66
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:05,200
I feel like that would be disrespectful.

67
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:06,880
- I didn't make that choice.

68
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:08,000
(laughing)

69
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:08,840
You know what I mean?

70
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:11,760
I wasn't like, oh yeah, I'm gonna be this kid.

71
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:12,600
No, it was fucking--

72
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:14,640
- But I wasn't that kid though.

73
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:15,760
- I was so horny. - I wasn't that kid.

74
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:19,520
No, I would like fuck like a crack in a door when I was a kid.

75
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:20,520
I tried everything.

76
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:21,520
You would fuck a cracker.

77
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:22,520
You would fuck a Ritz cracker.

78
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:23,520
You would fuck one of the little holes.

79
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:24,520
You would fuck one of the little holes.

80
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:25,520
The hole, yeah.

81
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:31,160
You have the room, you have the room on your thing, your P-man to fuck a cracker.

82
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:33,120
Yeah, I have the room on my P-man.

83
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:36,840
I've been, I've been, I can't stop thinking about calling a penis a P-man.

84
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:37,840
Yeah.

85
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:40,800
And be like, "Oh, my P-man hurts so bad today."

86
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:43,360
Oh, you guys are gross talking about piss and where your hair comes from.

87
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:44,360
Where did that come from?

88
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:45,360
I don't want to, what?

89
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:46,720
- What, P-man?

90
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:48,600
- No, Cameron and I were talking.

91
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:50,520
- It was, someone said something,

92
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:53,920
I forgot who said something about C-man,

93
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:56,520
and I said, "Yeah, C-man comes out my P-man."

94
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:59,320
- Yeah, yeah, we were making fun of Seamus.

95
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:01,200
- Yeah. - Seamus, you fucking moron.

96
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:02,400
- Seamus, we're gonna attack you.

97
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:04,360
- Yeah, hey man, do you wanna go sit in the bathtub

98
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:06,040
and touch each other's P-man?

99
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:07,840
(laughing)

100
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:08,760
- Yes.

101
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:11,680
- It's like the Cheetahmen, but P-man.

102
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:14,940
- P-man, P-man is so funny.

103
00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:17,140
- Dude, P-Man, so, it's so good.

104
00:03:17,140 --> 00:03:18,700
It's like perfect.

105
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:20,020
- Yeah, like, you know, like the--

106
00:03:20,020 --> 00:03:20,860
- That's nasty, dude.

107
00:03:20,860 --> 00:03:21,940
- I got that idea.

108
00:03:21,940 --> 00:03:25,700
It's like a chess, like the chessmen cookies,

109
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:27,440
but it's the P-Man cookies.

110
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:28,280
- Yeah.

111
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:29,100
- Stop! - Oh, Caleb's--

112
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:29,940
- No!

113
00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:32,180
(laughing)

114
00:03:32,180 --> 00:03:35,580
- No, don't go out, don't leave the frame.

115
00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:36,420
Don't leave the frame.

116
00:03:36,420 --> 00:03:38,020
Don't leave the frame of the Zoom call.

117
00:03:38,020 --> 00:03:38,860
Stay in frame.

118
00:03:38,860 --> 00:03:40,860
Keep laughing, keep your mouth open.

119
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:41,700
- No, no, uh-oh.

120
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:42,520
- Don't cover your eyes.

121
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:44,180
Don't cover your eyes, look in the camera.

122
00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:46,180
No yeah, Cameron take your jacket off.

123
00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:50,180
Patrick is so scared of Caleb jacking off.

124
00:03:50,180 --> 00:03:55,180
I'm not kidding, right now my penis might be the smallest it's ever been in my entire life.

125
00:03:55,180 --> 00:03:57,180
Oh my god dude it got so cold so quick.

126
00:03:57,180 --> 00:04:02,180
I'm looking at it right now, I mean it looks like a fucking clit.

127
00:04:02,180 --> 00:04:08,180
Yeah, I looked down at my thingy in the shower and it was, it just.

128
00:04:08,180 --> 00:04:11,180
Also I just smelled it, it smells like Olive Garden.

129
00:04:11,180 --> 00:04:12,820
(laughter)

130
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:15,180
- My dick smells like breadsticks right now.

131
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:16,020
- It does, dude.

132
00:04:16,020 --> 00:04:18,100
- It's from fucking all those breadsticks.

133
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:19,860
- Smells like rosemary and garlic.

134
00:04:19,860 --> 00:04:21,980
- Yeah, I'm looking kinda red today.

135
00:04:21,980 --> 00:04:24,940
I think I'm on the Caleb tip.

136
00:04:24,940 --> 00:04:27,380
- Yeah, you will be on my tip soon.

137
00:04:27,380 --> 00:04:28,220
- Yeah.

138
00:04:28,220 --> 00:04:31,860
- Yeah, I was, it's so cold lately,

139
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:33,740
I was looking down at my P-Man in the shower,

140
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:35,940
it only reached halfway down the drain, dude.

141
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:37,700
- Wow.

142
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:39,420
- Come on, dude, you little, don't lie.

143
00:04:39,420 --> 00:04:41,420
No, Cameron, you don't lie.

144
00:04:41,420 --> 00:04:46,420
You're dangling your dick down the drain to get a snarl of hair out of the drain.

145
00:04:46,420 --> 00:04:48,420
You're lying, you're lying on the drain.

146
00:04:48,420 --> 00:04:53,420
The pee hole bites the hair like a claw and pulls it back out.

147
00:04:53,420 --> 00:04:54,420
Disgusting.

148
00:04:54,420 --> 00:04:56,420
It's great because I have a snake shaped penis.

149
00:04:56,420 --> 00:04:59,420
Yeah, that's why I call it a pee man because it's sentient.

150
00:04:59,420 --> 00:05:00,420
It's got little hands on the end.

151
00:05:00,420 --> 00:05:03,420
It's more like a guy than it is a body part.

152
00:05:03,420 --> 00:05:05,420
I would love to have a little penis no matter the type of my penis.

153
00:05:05,420 --> 00:05:07,420
Just pee man, more guy than dick.

154
00:05:07,420 --> 00:05:09,700
laying down, laying down with your arms,

155
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:12,220
like laying down in jumping jack form

156
00:05:12,220 --> 00:05:14,300
while your penis is in the drain.

157
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:15,340
- Just spread eagle.

158
00:05:15,340 --> 00:05:18,480
- I was gonna say spread eagle,

159
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:21,080
but I felt like jumping jack painted a better picture.

160
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:23,820
- Lying on your back outside the tub

161
00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:26,480
and your dick draped over and going down the drain.

162
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:30,860
- There's a lot of dick talk,

163
00:05:30,860 --> 00:05:34,180
but I realized recently that every single time I'm on a plane

164
00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:36,020
I have a boner the entire flight

165
00:05:36,020 --> 00:05:37,020
and I can't get rid of it.

166
00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:42,300
really yeah I can't get rid of it yeah I just because you're scared I'm maybe

167
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:47,060
when I'm terrified I get a I get a huge fucking rock hard sting yeah yeah that

168
00:05:47,060 --> 00:05:51,980
might be it sense that's I feel like that in doesn't that happen in movies

169
00:05:51,980 --> 00:05:55,380
don't people say they get boners when they're scared in movies yeah there's a

170
00:05:55,380 --> 00:05:59,540
whole Kenny versus any episode where they test that yeah in my brain there

171
00:05:59,540 --> 00:06:05,580
well spinny is Mythbusters no basically Kenny versus penny was like they had a

172
00:06:05,580 --> 00:06:13,100
whole episode like who whoever gets the first boner loses yeah I would win yeah

173
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:19,980
that I feel like we could just do that show yeah yeah just a bonus episode just

174
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:24,620
weekly just the bone every week exactly and you have a game show who gets a

175
00:06:24,620 --> 00:06:28,500
boner first and you get random people women no it's got to be like it's got to

176
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:32,460
be last it's got to be better if it's last because then people will try to give

184
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:03,700
- You think that it stops in middle school, but it doesn't.

185
00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:04,900
- No, dude, no.

186
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:06,340
I mean, not for me, man.

187
00:07:06,340 --> 00:07:11,340
Also, every time I'm in a job where I have a training session

188
00:07:11,340 --> 00:07:14,300
- Every time I'm in a job interview, I get rock hard.

189
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:17,420
I stand up and I point down and I say, there's the legend.

190
00:07:17,420 --> 00:07:21,580
- When I worked in IT, every training session, I got a boner.

191
00:07:21,580 --> 00:07:23,320
- Every time I'm in a job interview

192
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:26,540
and the boss sits down on my lap, I get a huge boner.

193
00:07:26,540 --> 00:07:27,380
(laughing)

194
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:28,220
- Oh, I hate that.

195
00:07:28,220 --> 00:07:29,040
- That sucks so much.

196
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:30,540
- I hate when I get a boner when I'm on the block,

197
00:07:30,540 --> 00:07:31,900
- When he's grinding on me.

198
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:34,100
Oh my God, it's so embarrassing.

199
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:35,060
- At the cheetah club.

200
00:07:35,060 --> 00:07:35,900
- Yeah.

201
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:37,220
- At the bar during the interview.

202
00:07:37,220 --> 00:07:39,860
- Oh, he's listening to Miss Pretty Pussy by Plies

203
00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:41,100
and he's grinding on me.

204
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:43,340
(laughing)

205
00:07:43,340 --> 00:07:45,380
- I'm just Plies, man.

206
00:07:45,380 --> 00:07:46,220
- I hate that.

207
00:07:46,220 --> 00:07:48,420
- And then he turns around and he puts on X-Ray specs

208
00:07:48,420 --> 00:07:49,860
and he looks down at my crotch and he goes,

209
00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:50,980
"Not good."

210
00:07:50,980 --> 00:07:52,140
And he dismisses me.

211
00:07:52,140 --> 00:07:53,260
- Not good enough.

212
00:07:53,260 --> 00:07:54,100
- Yeah.

213
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:54,920
- Yeah.

214
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:56,020
- Could be better.

215
00:07:56,020 --> 00:07:56,860
- Yeah.

216
00:07:56,860 --> 00:07:58,100
- Sorry, but we need to make sure

217
00:07:58,100 --> 00:07:59,460
that if a customer grinds on you,

218
00:07:59,460 --> 00:08:01,360
you're prepared to not get a boner

219
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:03,020
and it seems you failed the test.

220
00:08:03,020 --> 00:08:05,980
- It's a Chipotle.

221
00:08:05,980 --> 00:08:08,580
And now for the boner test.

222
00:08:08,580 --> 00:08:10,100
Seems like you passed the drug test,

223
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:11,260
the background check's all good.

224
00:08:11,260 --> 00:08:13,220
Now I'm gonna see if I can give you a boner.

225
00:08:13,220 --> 00:08:14,780
(laughing)

226
00:08:14,780 --> 00:08:15,620
- I'm just gonna flick it a little bit.

227
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:18,540
- This is just a little thing I like to do with new hires.

228
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:19,380
- Yeah, contact those boners.

229
00:08:19,380 --> 00:08:21,380
- Does it get to know you, game?

230
00:08:21,380 --> 00:08:22,820
- I'll take a--

231
00:08:22,820 --> 00:08:24,780
- I'm trying to give you a boner worth my mind.

232
00:08:24,780 --> 00:08:26,180
- I'll take a steak burrito

233
00:08:26,180 --> 00:08:30,360
and also, imagine, a huge pussy, huge pussy,

234
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:33,580
tiny butthole, two huge boobs, girl's mouth.

235
00:08:33,580 --> 00:08:34,900
- Biggest boobs of all time.

236
00:08:34,900 --> 00:08:36,900
- Two of the biggest balloon boobs you've ever seen.

237
00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:39,920
Two giant planet Earths hanging off of a stick woman.

238
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:41,540
- Can you put, can you put--

239
00:08:41,540 --> 00:08:44,440
- Can you put two huge Pam Anderson inflatable tits

240
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:45,340
on my burrito?

241
00:08:45,340 --> 00:08:46,900
- Can you put a burrito-- - Oh, sorry, misspoke.

242
00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:47,740
What's that in your pants?

243
00:08:47,740 --> 00:08:49,500
- Can you wrap a boob in tinfoil for me?

244
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:50,860
- Yeah. (laughing)

245
00:08:50,860 --> 00:08:51,700
- Can you wrap a boob in tinfoil?

246
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:53,300
- Can you put a vagina and a boob

247
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:55,900
as a combo into tinfoil and heat it up

248
00:08:55,900 --> 00:08:59,180
and covered in nacho cheese and then give it to me.

249
00:08:59,180 --> 00:09:00,140
There we go.

250
00:09:00,140 --> 00:09:00,980
You lost and you're fired.

251
00:09:00,980 --> 00:09:02,580
- Can I get a fuckable quesadilla?

252
00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:04,620
- Yeah, can I get a thing of carnitas

253
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:05,440
that looks like a pussy? - Can I get a quesadilla

254
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:06,620
with a hole in the middle?

255
00:09:06,620 --> 00:09:08,660
(laughing)

256
00:09:08,660 --> 00:09:09,500
- Just a hole.

257
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:11,700
Size doesn't matter, any kind of hole.

258
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:12,540
You can do it with a hole.

259
00:09:12,540 --> 00:09:14,180
- Hey, John, you want anything?

260
00:09:14,180 --> 00:09:15,100
You want anything, John?

261
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:16,420
Two holes, actually.

262
00:09:16,420 --> 00:09:18,680
(laughing)

263
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:21,420
- And honestly, you know, it's--

264
00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:23,100
- Yeah, what's the bathroom code?

265
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:24,940
(laughing)

266
00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:25,780
- 80085.

267
00:09:25,780 --> 00:09:28,020
(laughing)

268
00:09:28,020 --> 00:09:32,340
I feel like quesadilla of all the foods

269
00:09:32,340 --> 00:09:34,300
that you put on your dick would feel pretty nice.

270
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:36,420
- Quesadilla, we're nasty today, boys.

271
00:09:36,420 --> 00:09:39,260
- Fresh off the fuckin' stove, dude.

272
00:09:39,260 --> 00:09:40,100
- Fresh off the gun city.

273
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:41,300
- We're gross, man.

274
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:42,540
- I thought you were talking about us.

275
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:44,180
I thought you were talking about us being nasty.

276
00:09:44,180 --> 00:09:46,940
I didn't know you were talking about quesadillas still.

277
00:09:46,940 --> 00:09:47,980
- Why are we nasty?

278
00:09:47,980 --> 00:09:48,820
Are you guys--

279
00:09:48,820 --> 00:09:49,640
- We're nasty AF.

280
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:50,480
- I just took a sip of coffee, dude.

281
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:51,320
- Are you guys naughty today?

282
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:52,140
- Yeah.

283
00:09:52,140 --> 00:09:53,220
- Oh, is the naughty episode.

284
00:09:53,220 --> 00:09:54,420
- Are we naughty and horny?

285
00:09:54,420 --> 00:09:56,540
- Ugh, Christ.

286
00:09:56,540 --> 00:09:57,380
What's wrong with me?

287
00:09:57,380 --> 00:09:58,740
I'm having dirty thoughts.

288
00:09:58,740 --> 00:10:00,860
- It's 'cause we know we're gonna see each other

289
00:10:00,860 --> 00:10:01,700
in a few weeks.

290
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:03,140
- Would it have to be a seafood quesadilla?

291
00:10:03,140 --> 00:10:05,100
- It's building up sexual tension.

292
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:07,020
It's starting to charge up.

293
00:10:07,020 --> 00:10:09,180
- I'd like to see food and then fuck it.

294
00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:10,220
The food.

295
00:10:10,220 --> 00:10:12,140
Yeah, I'm on the F food diet.

296
00:10:12,140 --> 00:10:14,760
I F food and then I eat it.

297
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:17,660
- That's what that new octopus documentary was about.

298
00:10:17,660 --> 00:10:20,420
A guy saw a calamari, he got a thing of calamari

299
00:10:20,420 --> 00:10:21,780
at Olive Garden, he got too horny

300
00:10:21,780 --> 00:10:22,620
and he had to go fuck an octopus.

301
00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:24,260
- Calamari's a squid, so that kind of

302
00:10:24,260 --> 00:10:27,060
- No. - If you sew six calamaris

303
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:29,260
together, that's a pretty good pussy.

304
00:10:29,260 --> 00:10:31,700
- You sew six of anything together.

305
00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:34,060
- That's true, yeah, that's a really good point.

306
00:10:34,060 --> 00:10:36,460
- As long as you put it in the right shape, it's fine.

307
00:10:36,460 --> 00:10:39,660
- I would say the worst thing that feels like

308
00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:41,700
it could be a fleshlight but would not be a good one

309
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:43,780
is a slinky.

310
00:10:43,780 --> 00:10:48,780
- Yeah, what about a bucket of ice water?

311
00:10:48,780 --> 00:10:53,380
- A bucket of ice water, well, I guess there's a hole

312
00:10:53,380 --> 00:10:56,120
- Yeah, and it's filled with wetness.

313
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:57,780
- There's a hole in water.

314
00:10:57,780 --> 00:10:58,620
- That's true.

315
00:10:58,620 --> 00:11:01,700
I guess I could just kind of fuck a pond, I feel like.

316
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:03,020
If I got like a--

317
00:11:03,020 --> 00:11:07,780
- I'd have to be a bog for me.

318
00:11:07,780 --> 00:11:09,740
- Well, a bog will be thicker for sure.

319
00:11:09,740 --> 00:11:10,940
- Yeah.

320
00:11:10,940 --> 00:11:12,620
- A bog is gonna have some heft to it.

321
00:11:12,620 --> 00:11:14,180
You're gonna feel some resistance.

322
00:11:14,180 --> 00:11:15,340
How about a frozen lake?

323
00:11:15,340 --> 00:11:16,180
- What about a scoby?

324
00:11:16,180 --> 00:11:17,020
- A hole in a frozen lake?

325
00:11:17,020 --> 00:11:18,980
- Yeah, like an ice fisher's hole.

326
00:11:18,980 --> 00:11:20,380
- Like a scoby from kombucha.

327
00:11:20,380 --> 00:11:21,820
- Shower dough starter.

328
00:11:21,820 --> 00:11:23,220
I feel like that would be okay.

329
00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:25,320
- That might be, we might be onto something there.

330
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:27,080
- I think that's what sourdough starter is.

331
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:27,920
I think it's like a guy fucks flour.

332
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:29,720
- You have to start it.

333
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:31,040
You have to start it up.

334
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:33,160
- It's alive 'cause you cum in it.

335
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:34,720
- Yeah, you gave it life.

336
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:35,860
- You gave it, yeah.

337
00:11:35,860 --> 00:11:38,680
You need that to eat the,

338
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:40,840
you need something in there for the yeast to eat.

339
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:42,080
- Something has to eat your disgusting cum.

340
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:43,200
- Scientists in a lab being like,

341
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:44,920
we're trying to generate light,

342
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:46,400
we're trying to create life in a lab,

343
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:48,600
and they're just cumming onto various chemicals.

344
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:50,200
(laughing)

345
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:52,280
- No, they accidentally came all over the lab.

346
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:55,780
- That's how Dr. Frankenstein brought the monster to life

347
00:11:55,780 --> 00:11:58,920
is he just came in him and then jump started him.

348
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:00,900
- It'd be kinda sexy to watch Sourdough Starter

349
00:12:00,900 --> 00:12:01,900
eat your comb up.

350
00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:03,660
(laughing)

351
00:12:03,660 --> 00:12:04,900
Be kinda hot.

352

377
00:12:48,060 --> 00:12:50,060

378
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:52,060

"Yeah, so I fucked a pile of dirt again,

third time this week."

383
00:12:58,940 --> 00:13:02,300
- You know what, when your dick touches loam,

384
00:13:02,300 --> 00:13:04,700

385
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:05,660

Yeah, I was trying to wean myself off of fucking things,

388
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:13,220
but I saw this amazing tree stump

389
00:13:13,220 --> 00:13:14,700
when I was walking down the street

390
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:16,380
and I just couldn't help myself.

391
00:13:16,380 --> 00:13:17,780
- Men are disgusting, dude.

392
00:13:17,780 --> 00:13:20,500
Women on the other hand, they only fuck vegetables.

393
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:21,580
- Yeah, that's true.

394
00:13:21,580 --> 00:13:22,420
- As God intended.

395
00:13:22,420 --> 00:13:24,180
- Vegetables and animals.

396
00:13:24,180 --> 00:13:25,020
- Yeah.

397
00:13:25,020 --> 00:13:27,380
- Well, an animal's a vegetable.

398
00:13:27,380 --> 00:13:28,220
- That's true.

399
00:13:28,220 --> 00:13:29,340
- Okay, okay.

400
00:13:29,340 --> 00:13:31,420
- Is a scoby an animal?

401
00:13:31,420 --> 00:13:32,740
- Scoby-do.

402
00:13:32,740 --> 00:13:34,620
(laughing)

403
00:13:34,620 --> 00:13:35,740
He's an animal.

404
00:13:35,740 --> 00:13:38,100
- Well, I mean, a scoby is technically living.

405
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:39,980
- He's not an animal 'cause he can talk.

406
00:13:39,980 --> 00:13:40,820
- Let me--

407
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:41,820
- He's a human, technically.

408
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:44,060
- Is a scoby living?

409
00:13:44,060 --> 00:13:45,240
- Yeah, let me look this up.

410
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:46,080
- I don't think it's living.

411
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:50,800

00:19:40,460 --> 00:19:47,660
married. Yeah. That's not, oh, in what state? Massachusetts. Main Massachusetts.

536
00:19:47,660 --> 00:19:54,500
The main state Massachusetts. The main part of Massachusetts. In Newburyport.

537
00:19:54,500 --> 00:20:00,220
Yeah, the main area. Yeah. Well, mainly Massachusetts. A few other states.

538
00:20:00,220 --> 00:20:05,220
Mainly burgers in Central Square. I'm gonna be honest, this ruins a couple of the other

539
00:20:05,220 --> 00:20:08,340
questions. Yeah, now Caleb it's interesting that you chose to read that one first

540
00:20:08,340 --> 00:20:12,620
because I got I got one sent actually to my personal email which is weird because

541
00:20:12,620 --> 00:20:18,020
it was also addressed to to Patrick but it says, "Patrick what is the full

542
00:20:18,020 --> 00:20:22,580
description of your penis? Do you have a little p-man or a giant brute? What is

543
00:20:22,580 --> 00:20:26,460
the hex code of the color of your thingy? Is your wick wide or long, is your wick

544
00:20:26,460 --> 00:20:30,620
wide and long or short and thin like a hair clipping? Will you let me touch your

545
00:20:30,620 --> 00:20:36,220
special downstairs fellow and that's also from Caleb Pitts. Oh. It seems like Caleb

546
00:20:36,220 --> 00:20:43,860
is doubling down on... As Popeye once said, "I am what I am." And I am in love with

547
00:20:43,860 --> 00:20:47,020
Patrick. So let's go through these questions one by one that Caleb is

548
00:20:47,020 --> 00:20:52,380
asking you, Patrick. Okay. What is the full description of your penis? Full

549
00:20:52,380 --> 00:20:58,300
description... Give me the dirty details. Normal is way too vague. No, it's

550
00:20:58,300 --> 00:21:03,180
It's very normal if you Google image search of it.

551
00:21:03,180 --> 00:21:06,060
Normal is doing nothing for me down there right now.

552
00:21:06,060 --> 00:21:07,060
Can you at least make it hot?

553
00:21:07,060 --> 00:21:08,780
It's my, it's my, I have the stick.

554
00:21:08,780 --> 00:21:09,780
It's my turn to speak.

555
00:21:09,780 --> 00:21:10,780
Can you just whisper?

556
00:21:10,780 --> 00:21:11,780
Oh, you have a stick?

557
00:21:11,780 --> 00:21:12,780
A stick, okay, so that's the description.

558
00:21:12,780 --> 00:21:13,780
There's some detail.

559
00:21:13,780 --> 00:21:14,780
Yeah.

560
00:21:14,780 --> 00:21:15,780
There's some detail.

561
00:21:15,780 --> 00:21:16,780
It's right here, that's my stick.

562
00:21:16,780 --> 00:21:20,420
Alright, well let's, do you have a little p-man or a giant brute?

563
00:21:20,420 --> 00:21:22,580
Well, I'm telling, I didn't finish with the first one.

564
00:21:22,580 --> 00:21:25,500
Okay, well you clearly don't have a good answer for the first one, so let's keep this, let's

565
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:26,500
move forward.

566
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:30,340
Google search penis and the first result that's my penis.

567
00:21:30,340 --> 00:21:31,180
- Really?

568
00:21:31,180 --> 00:21:32,020
- Yeah.

569
00:21:32,020 --> 00:21:34,300
- I'm not gonna Google it 'cause I know it by memory.

570
00:21:34,300 --> 00:21:36,300
That is pretty disappointing.

571
00:21:36,300 --> 00:21:37,140
What's the hex code?

572
00:21:37,140 --> 00:21:39,620
- I didn't say it was a pointing.

573
00:21:39,620 --> 00:21:41,540
- What's the hex code of the color?

574
00:21:41,540 --> 00:21:43,820
- Hex code of the color is 00000F.

575
00:21:43,820 --> 00:21:50,860
- Okay, so that's just a very dark gray.

576
00:21:50,860 --> 00:21:51,700
- Yeah.

577
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:54,900
- Almost black, barely.

578
00:21:54,900 --> 00:21:55,740
- Is F a rating?

579
00:21:55,740 --> 00:21:58,140
- It looks like when you boil pork.

580
00:21:58,140 --> 00:22:00,060
- It looks like when you boil a penis.

581
00:22:00,060 --> 00:22:01,380
- Yeah, pretty much.

582
00:22:01,380 --> 00:22:02,220
- Yeah.

583
00:22:02,220 --> 00:22:03,980
- It looks like boiled pork.

584
00:22:03,980 --> 00:22:06,460
Then you go to, if you've ever been to Hot Pot.

585
00:22:06,460 --> 00:22:07,780
- Yeah, I love Hot Pot.

586
00:22:07,780 --> 00:22:11,400
- Yeah, so imagine just what all the meat looks like there.

587
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:13,100
- All of it?

588
00:22:13,100 --> 00:22:15,620
- And I do all of the meat, even the shrimp.

589
00:22:15,620 --> 00:22:17,820
- Imagine Jim Gaffigan at Hot Pot, right?

590
00:22:17,820 --> 00:22:19,220
(laughing)

591
00:22:19,220 --> 00:22:21,020
Yeah, that'd be pretty.

592
00:22:21,020 --> 00:22:23,180
♪ Hot Pot ♪

593
00:22:23,180 --> 00:22:24,620
- He would be like, "Wow."

594
00:22:24,620 --> 00:22:30,900
words yeah yeah and then they yell at him in Chinese these meats look like

595
00:22:30,900 --> 00:22:36,980
Patrick's penis that's what he would do if you describe your penis as a long pig

596
00:22:36,980 --> 00:22:43,980
or a short pig short pig the short pig you heard it here yep are you gonna let

597
00:22:43,980 --> 00:22:51,020
Caleb touch it no what if it's for a video if it's it depends what if we're

598
00:22:51,020 --> 00:22:55,100
making what if you're starring in a day by what if we make you a star of jackass

599
00:22:55,100 --> 00:23:00,140
for okay and that's one of the pranks I've been thinking about this what do

600
00:23:00,140 --> 00:23:03,260
you think we'd get sued if we just made jackass for cuz they're never gonna do

601
00:23:03,260 --> 00:23:07,300
it aren't they weren't they are making it they're in production we okay

602
00:23:07,300 --> 00:23:14,260
jackass five or we could beat them to four and then sue them when the movie

603
00:23:14,260 --> 00:23:16,180
(laughing)

604
00:23:16,180 --> 00:23:17,320
- Payday. - That's a good idea.

605
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:18,740
- That's a pretty good idea. - That is not a bad idea.

606
00:23:18,740 --> 00:23:19,580
- Yeah.

607
00:23:19,580 --> 00:23:20,420
- Maybe we do that when you guys come to New York.

608
00:23:20,420 --> 00:23:22,380
- Maybe we'll just make a five minute video.

609
00:23:22,380 --> 00:23:24,740
- Five minute movie called Jackass 4.

610
00:23:24,740 --> 00:23:27,260
And then when Jackass 4 comes out.

611
00:23:27,260 --> 00:23:29,140
- And it's just Caleb touching my penis.

612
00:23:29,140 --> 00:23:32,580
- Let's make a huge, we send them a cease and desist.

613
00:23:32,580 --> 00:23:34,220
- This is actually a very good idea.

614
00:23:34,220 --> 00:23:36,380
- All right, we're gonna do this.

615
00:23:36,380 --> 00:23:39,580
- Send it on a Sullivan the Frog Enterprises letterhead.

616
00:23:39,580 --> 00:23:40,420
- Yeah.

617
00:23:40,420 --> 00:23:41,980
(laughing)

618
00:23:41,980 --> 00:23:42,820
- Okay.

619
00:23:42,820 --> 00:23:43,660
- That's a good idea.

620
00:23:43,660 --> 00:23:49,480
that's a plan okay all right Pat do you have it do you have a mailbag yeah did

621
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:55,780
you receive email I received a lot of emails I've received this one here it's

622
00:23:55,780 --> 00:24:01,660
to Cameron it says hi Cameron this is your big cousin Reynaldo I am writing

623
00:24:01,660 --> 00:24:05,340
today to address some of the nasty rumors you have said about me on your

624
00:24:05,340 --> 00:24:09,860
little podcast no I am NOT a sex offender and no I'm not going to prom

625
00:24:09,860 --> 00:24:11,460
with my little brother.

626
00:24:11,460 --> 00:24:13,460
It disgusts me that you would say all this stuff

627
00:24:13,460 --> 00:24:16,940
about your big cousin even though I'm only 17 years old.

628
00:24:16,940 --> 00:24:19,240
When my mom died, you said you would be my best friend

629
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:20,860
and look out for me, and now you use me

630
00:24:20,860 --> 00:24:22,840
like a puppet for comedy.

631
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:25,540
My question is, do you stand by your remarks?

632
00:24:25,540 --> 00:24:26,820
- Yeah.

633
00:24:26,820 --> 00:24:27,660
- Oh, you do. - You stand by them?

634
00:24:27,660 --> 00:24:29,460
- Yeah, look. - Wow, that's bold.

635
00:24:29,460 --> 00:24:30,280
- Wow.

636
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:32,620
I mean, Ray Naldo is way bigger than you.

637
00:24:32,620 --> 00:24:34,420
- Yeah, he's like 10 feet tall.

638
00:24:34,420 --> 00:24:36,060
- Doesn't he have a-- - He's really skinny, though.

639
00:24:36,060 --> 00:24:39,220
He's got like matchstick arms and legs.

640
00:24:39,220 --> 00:24:41,520
- But he also has a bat with a bunch of nails in it.

641
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:43,620
- Yeah, but he doesn't--

642
00:24:43,620 --> 00:24:45,860
- And it's scaled to his size.

643
00:24:45,860 --> 00:24:48,760
- He only uses it to play baseball, though.

644
00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:50,020
- It's like a cricket bat.

645
00:24:50,020 --> 00:24:51,100
- Mm-hmm.

646
00:24:51,100 --> 00:24:51,940
- He just swings it.

647
00:24:51,940 --> 00:24:54,500
- It's got a picture of a cricket engraved in it.

648
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:56,020
- Yeah, that's what I meant.

649
00:24:56,020 --> 00:24:58,680
- Yeah, that's why we called him Reynaldo the Cricket

650
00:24:58,680 --> 00:25:00,200
when we were growing up.

651
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:02,820
It was also 'cause he can only speak in cricket noises,

652
00:25:02,820 --> 00:25:04,660
which is, I think, why he had to write me a letter

653
00:25:04,660 --> 00:25:06,380
instead of calling me on the phone.

654
00:25:06,380 --> 00:25:07,220
- Yeah.

655
00:25:07,220 --> 00:25:08,060
- Yeah.

656
00:25:08,060 --> 00:25:09,700
- He sent it to my email too.

657
00:25:09,700 --> 00:25:11,020
- I think he got confused.

658
00:25:11,020 --> 00:25:11,860
- So bad he has a typing.

659
00:25:11,860 --> 00:25:14,660
- Yeah, I think he might have been trying to use Siri

660
00:25:14,660 --> 00:25:16,780
to say who he was sending it to.

661
00:25:16,780 --> 00:25:18,180
- His little cricket mind.

662
00:25:18,180 --> 00:25:19,780
- Yeah.

663
00:25:19,780 --> 00:25:23,060
Yeah, no, I stand by those remarks.

664
00:25:23,060 --> 00:25:25,340
You wanna come get me, Ronaldo, you come get me.

665
00:25:25,340 --> 00:25:27,260
You know where I am.

666
00:25:27,260 --> 00:25:28,580
- Oh my God.

667
00:25:28,580 --> 00:25:32,220
Wow, this is the first beef. - Is Ronaldo single?

668
00:25:32,220 --> 00:25:33,060
- He doesn't say.

669
00:25:33,060 --> 00:25:36,160
- No, he went to prom with his little brother.

670
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:37,900
and he's in a committed relationship

671
00:25:37,900 --> 00:25:38,880
with his little brother.

672
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:39,880
Okay. Oh my God.

673
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:40,720
I didn't know that.

674
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:42,320
I didn't know that was real.

675
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:43,520
Can you respond to the email?

676
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:44,640

00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:45,800

695
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:16,080
I like this already. "I recently met the woman of my dreams at a mutual friends party.

696
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:20,880
She's gorgeous, intelligent, hilarious, and has piercing blue eyes that convince you to do

697
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:26,080
incomprehensible evil. She's a great public speaker and has a killer sense of fashion,

698
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:30,960
although she often wears the same thing every day. Parentheses, "If it ain't broke, don't fix it."

699
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:36,640
She's quite popular, though she prefers to keep a low profile as she hates being recognized in public.

700
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:41,600
I love everything about her, from her obsession with graphic design (she even has her own logo)

701
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:45,680
to her tiny square mustache that sits square in the middle of her upper lip.

702
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:51,200
"My problem is this. I'm almost certain that this woman is Adolf Hitler, leader of the Third Reich.

703
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:57,840
With her being 131 years old and me being 22, I worry what people will say if we start going

704
00:27:57,840 --> 00:28:03,360
steady. My question is, what age gap is acceptable in a relationship?" That's from Ezra.

705
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:06,320
What do you guys think?

706
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:09,760
It's a difficult question. If the woman's the one that's older, it's fine.

707
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:13,360
Okay. So I feel like you're fine then.

708
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:13,760
Yeah.

709
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:14,720
Yeah, I guess that's fine.

710
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:17,160
- Yeah, I mean the Ezra Hitler.

711
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:18,000
I like the sound of that.

712
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,440
- Can we go back a little bit?

713
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:22,460
Yeah, the Hitler thing isn't bothering you guys?

714
00:28:22,460 --> 00:28:25,600
- I mean, when you're in love, you're in love, right?

715
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:27,360
- Yeah, dude, who are we to say?

716
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:30,080
- Look, I don't know, I don't trust that name.

717
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:32,380
- You don't trust what, Ezra?

718
00:28:32,380 --> 00:28:33,720
Whoa, somebody's anti-Semitic.

719
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:36,520
- No, no, no.

720
00:28:36,520 --> 00:28:38,280
- What do you not trust about the name Ezra?

721
00:28:38,280 --> 00:28:39,240
I don't understand.

722
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:43,920
- Well, I've been reading a lot of history lately,

723
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:45,360
and there's this guy.

724
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:46,200
- Yeah, Civil War history.

725
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:48,240
- Oh, now we're gonna give some relationship advice

726
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:50,080
to Patrick, there's this guy, okay.

727
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:51,880
- Ah, all right, okay.

728
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:55,760
- There's this guy, he's been teaching me a lot of things.

729
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:58,000
- Yeah, sounds good. - So he's your teacher?

730
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,080
- Yeah, I guess he's a teacher,

731
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:04,560
I guess you could call me an apt pupil or whatever.

732
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:07,580
- Ooh, Mitch, your pupil is nice and apt.

733
00:29:07,580 --> 00:29:14,000
- Yeah, here's the problem, I'm also dating Hitlers.

734
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:17,540
Wow. Oh, so that's the issue you have here.

735
00:29:17,540 --> 00:29:18,540
Yeah. That is awkward.

736
00:29:18,540 --> 00:29:23,640
So, uh, Ezra says, "Keep away from my man."

737
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:25,400
Hitler's the rebound.

738
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:26,400
Mm-hmm.

739
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:27,400
[laughter]

740
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:29,720
I rebound with Hitler.

741
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:30,720
Mm-hmm.

742
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:31,720
Yeah.

743
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:36,160
So, you and Ezra are fighting for this woman's love.

744
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:38,080
This woman named Adolf Hitler.

745
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:39,080
[laughter]

746
00:29:39,080 --> 00:29:40,080
Okay.

747
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:42,120
So, tell me what you like about her.

748
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:44,380
(laughing)

749
00:29:44,380 --> 00:29:51,320
No, I'm actually just doing a joke.

750
00:29:51,320 --> 00:29:53,960
I'm not dating Hitler.

751
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:54,800
- I think you might be.

752
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:56,600
- I think you just feel bad now.

753
00:29:56,600 --> 00:29:58,840
- No, I just didn't want to say that on the show.

754
00:29:58,840 --> 00:30:01,900
- I think you're covering up 'cause you know that

755
00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:03,480
I'm also dating Hitler.

756
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:05,120
- You know Ezra's stronger than you.

757
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:07,280
- Yeah, one, I know Ezra's stronger than me,

758
00:30:07,280 --> 00:30:10,180
and two, Caleb, I didn't want to have

759
00:30:10,180 --> 00:30:11,520
a same-girl situation.

760
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:14,580
- Yeah, this is kind of the R. Kelly,

761
00:30:14,580 --> 00:30:16,620
R. Kelly and Usher remix with T-Pain,

762
00:30:16,620 --> 00:30:18,120
'cause there's three of us,

763
00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:19,540
and I'm kind of the T-Pain,

764
00:30:19,540 --> 00:30:21,340
you're clearly the R. Kelly,

765
00:30:21,340 --> 00:30:23,520
and then Ezra's the Usher, 'cause he's the best singer.

766
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:24,360
- No, I'm Usher.

767
00:30:24,360 --> 00:30:25,200
- You're not Usher, dude.

768
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:26,040
- I'm Usher. - Sing something.

769
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:26,880
- Sing something.

770
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:28,160
- Yeah! - Oh man, you're Gusher.

771
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:29,320
- You might-- - Yeah!

772
00:30:29,320 --> 00:30:31,080
- When Hitler's around-- - Yeah, yeah!

773
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:32,920
- When Hitler's around, it's hard not to be a Gusher.

774
00:30:32,920 --> 00:30:34,080
- Take that, rewind it back.

775
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:37,040
Usher got the beat to make your mama go (mimics whip)

776
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:37,880
- What?

777
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:39,420
He never says mama.

778
00:30:39,420 --> 00:30:42,640
Yeah it does. Do you think, do you think Usher, do you think

779
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:48,600
Usher and Hitler would have been friends? No, do you think Hitler ever made a woman come?

780
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:53,240
No, never mind. Do you think he ever made a woman squirt?

781
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:58,440
Do you think Hitler ever made a woman squirt with his fingers?

782
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:01,880
Because I have doubts. It's certainly possible.

783
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:07,240
I think when he wrote the Sibian he squirted. True, that's a good point.

784
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:08,840
- There's a, I have this letter.

785
00:31:08,840 --> 00:31:10,000
- We never answered the question

786
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,200
about what age gap is acceptable.

787
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:12,040
- Oh, it's fine.

788
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:15,680
- I would say, I think we've previously said on the podcast,

789
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:18,440
the only acceptable age gap is if you're dating

790
00:31:18,440 --> 00:31:20,280
your identical twin and you guys were born

791
00:31:20,280 --> 00:31:21,640
within 10 minutes of each other.

792
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:22,560
- Yep. - Yep.

793
00:31:22,560 --> 00:31:24,040
- Otherwise, you're out of luck.

794
00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:26,900
- Yep, so Ezra, back the fuck up.

795
00:31:26,900 --> 00:31:31,440
- If you don't date your brother, you're grooming.

796
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:32,280
- All right, so I got--

797
00:31:32,280 --> 00:31:33,100
- Get the hell out of here, Ezra.

798
00:31:33,100 --> 00:31:36,040
- I have this, I got this one in the email.

799
00:31:36,040 --> 00:31:38,520
Hey gang, long time listener, first time mailbagger.

800
00:31:38,520 --> 00:31:42,040
I'm a huge fan of the show and I love all the jokes you guys do about having uncles or if

801
00:31:42,040 --> 00:31:43,960
Squidward was combined with the Grinch.

802
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:46,300
I tell them to people all the time at work.

803
00:31:46,300 --> 00:31:49,420
Just the other day I pulled this guy over for a traffic stop and walked up to him with

804
00:31:49,420 --> 00:31:50,760
my hand on my gun.

805
00:31:50,760 --> 00:31:54,240
He was sweating bullets, he totally thought I was gonna shoot him or something lol.

806
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:57,880
I asked him "Sir, are you aware you are sucking a crap like it's McDonalds?"

807
00:31:57,880 --> 00:32:01,800
He didn't really laugh so I stuck a nail into his tire when I was walking back to my cruiser.

808
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:03,600
I'm pretty sure I heard him praying.

809
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:05,200
Anyway, I need some advice.

810
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:08,760
I just backed over my son's dog in the driveway about five minutes ago and I'm thinking of

811
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:12,100
abducting a homeless guy and dressing him in a super villain costume and telling my son

812
00:32:12,100 --> 00:32:14,700
it was Dr. Dog Destroyer who crushed the dog.

813
00:32:14,700 --> 00:32:17,920
I could set my son loose with my gun to hunt down the hobo or something.

814
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:21,760
My son's four by the way, he's a huge fan, I caught him eating his own shit one time.

815
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:24,020
Anyway, like I was saying, I need some advice.

816
00:32:24,020 --> 00:32:26,280
Can you guys think of a better super villain name?

817
00:32:26,280 --> 00:32:27,280
That's from the cool cop.

818
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:28,280
Yeah.

819
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:30,100
Better than Dr. Dog Destroyer?

820
00:32:30,100 --> 00:32:31,100
Hobo with a shotgun.

821
00:32:31,100 --> 00:32:33,600
That's pretty good, yeah.

822
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:40,040
K9. Hobo with a dog gun. Yeah, hobo with a dog gun. Yeah. You could go with something

823
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:43,840
kind of like all-purpose too. You could just call him like K9/11 doer.

824
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:49,720
Whoa, that's pretty good. K9/11 is pretty good, yeah. Yeah. That's a Jim Belushi movie. You could go with

825
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:53,880
something very, like catch-all and call him like Chaos or something and then you

826
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:57,640
could just kind of have him do any bad thing that happens. I've got a great

827
00:32:57,640 --> 00:33:04,000
villain name yeah okay what if we just call him the pedophile mr. mr. to damn

828
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:13,120
pedophile I might be good what about dog Hitler Oh even better what about dog

829
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:19,840
Hitler yeah I'm listening I'm listening that was found the only woman that's

830
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:29,560
gonna make him break up with Adolf Hitler. Yeah all dogs go to heaven. That's true.

831
00:33:29,560 --> 00:33:41,360
How about dogs? That's just a classic joke right there. Yeah I got one oh all

832
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:45,640
right we still go ahead. No I feel like I can't. Dog Hitler's gonna be as good as it

833
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:50,480
gets. What about Dr. Dog Hitler? Doctors, see that's, some people are just scared of

834
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:54,880
doctors, but some people are more scared of doctors than they are Hitler, you know?

835
00:33:54,880 --> 00:34:00,920
Nowadays. I'm not, the thing is I'm not really scared of Hitler. I mean, yeah I

836
00:34:00,920 --> 00:34:05,600
could take him one-on-one in a conversation. Yeah I would point out the

837
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:09,560
logical fallacies. Yeah I'm not so much scared as I am just kind of annoyed, you

838
00:34:09,560 --> 00:34:13,600
know? Yeah he is kind of a, he's kind of annoying, he's kind of like a, he's a real

839
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:15,100
monkey on my back sometimes.

840
00:34:15,100 --> 00:34:17,360
(laughing)

841
00:34:17,360 --> 00:34:18,200
- All right, so this-- - Pat, you said

842
00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:19,020
you have a question?

843
00:34:19,020 --> 00:34:22,400
- Yeah, okay, this is an email I got.

844
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:26,040
It says, "Hello Potabat List, it is me, Jubio.

845
00:34:26,040 --> 00:34:27,320
"How are you today?"

846
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:28,280
- Potabat List? - "My question is,

847
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:29,360
"can I kiss Caleb?

848
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:30,740
"I've always wanted to kiss him.

849
00:34:30,740 --> 00:34:32,800
"Thank you, Jubio."

850
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:34,480
- Yeah, Jubio, no problem.

851
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:35,600
Yeah, that's fine. - Okay.

852
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:37,800
- I'm not Caleb, but I'm saying that's fine.

853
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:39,520
- Yeah, I think I'm fine with it, too.

854
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:40,560
- Anyone can kiss me.

855
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:42,800
Any, I'll say this much. - Oh, I got another one.

856
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:50,160
okay hello it is Jubio again can I receive Caleb's kiss this Sunday?

857
00:34:50,160 --> 00:34:54,320
You're moving things a little fast yeah I was just about to say this goes for all

00:37:30,100 --> 00:37:32,520
- Yeah, I said I guessed.

896
00:37:32,520 --> 00:37:34,160
I guessed it was Pat.

897
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:35,880
The thing is, Pat, I'm--

898
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:37,600
- I told you not at the beginning.

899
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:39,080
- I think you know I don't have a daughter.

900
00:37:39,080 --> 00:37:39,920
And I think you don't have a daughter.

901
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:42,320
- Size 48 font, at the beginning of my email,

902
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:45,480
I said do not read this, it's for Caleb.

903
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:48,240
- Oh, I don't know why you sent it to my email then.

904
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:49,360
- He gets mixed up.

905
00:37:49,360 --> 00:37:51,120
- Well, I blocked him from sending stuff

906
00:37:51,120 --> 00:37:56,160
to my email a long time ago. Yeah. So just because he kept sending shit like that. He

907
00:37:56,160 --> 00:38:00,720
sends rhyming poems about how much he likes what you used to do. If you don't appreciate

908
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:06,760
my fucking limericks then why am I here? Say one of your limericks right now. There once

930
00:39:36,900 --> 00:39:42,740
Not again. Real quick, just real quick, and don't think about this one too much. Do

931
00:39:42,740 --> 00:39:45,660
you Patrick take Caleb as your lawfully wedded husband to have and to hold

932
00:39:45,660 --> 00:39:48,460
through sickness and in health, in good times and bad, keeping yourself under him

933
00:39:48,460 --> 00:39:51,380
as long as you both shall live? So I think the correct answer here would be I do.

934
00:39:51,380 --> 00:39:54,740
Let me just say...

935
00:39:54,740 --> 00:39:56,740
What was that? Did his audio just turn off?

936
00:39:56,740 --> 00:40:00,740
Oh no, my microphone cut but what I was gonna say...

937
00:40:00,740 --> 00:40:02,740
Well we'll take that as an I do.

938
00:40:02,740 --> 00:40:06,540
Yeah, no, we actually have that. I think in the state of New York, if your microphone cuts out,

939
00:40:06,540 --> 00:40:07,380
- No, no.

940
00:40:07,380 --> 00:40:08,220
- It counts as a yes.

941
00:40:08,220 --> 00:40:09,040
- No.

942
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:09,880
- Yeah, so.

943
00:40:09,880 --> 00:40:10,720
- Well, I'm in New Hampshire,

944
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:11,540
so I don't know what the statute of limitations would be.

945
00:40:11,540 --> 00:40:13,300
- Well, but the internet is in New York,

946
00:40:13,300 --> 00:40:14,140
and you're on the internet right now.

947
00:40:14,140 --> 00:40:14,980
- No, I think the internet's in Boston.

948
00:40:14,980 --> 00:40:16,500
- The internet's based out of New York.

949
00:40:16,500 --> 00:40:18,980
- Well, I mean, it kinda depends on what he was saying

950
00:40:18,980 --> 00:40:20,540
when his microphone cut out.

951
00:40:20,540 --> 00:40:21,700
- It actually doesn't depend at all.

952
00:40:21,700 --> 00:40:23,500
- And we'll never know what I said, so.

953
00:40:23,500 --> 00:40:25,180
- If you don't respond when someone asks you

954
00:40:25,180 --> 00:40:26,860
to marry them, you have to.

955
00:40:26,860 --> 00:40:27,780
- Yeah.

956
00:40:27,780 --> 00:40:29,460
Yeah, it's, yeah.

957
00:40:29,460 --> 00:40:31,180
- Yeah, you have to specifically opt out.

958
00:40:31,180 --> 00:40:33,140
- Specifically the volume yes.

959
00:40:33,140 --> 00:40:34,540
- Yeah.

960
00:40:34,540 --> 00:40:36,860
- Well, no, we won't know what I said.

961
00:40:36,860 --> 00:40:39,900
- I already know, 'cause I'm actually an expert read lipper,

962
00:40:39,900 --> 00:40:44,300
and you said, you said yes, yes, yes a million times yes.

963
00:40:44,300 --> 00:40:46,060
You had me at hello.

964
00:40:46,060 --> 00:40:46,900
- No.

965
00:40:46,900 --> 00:40:48,340
- Yeah, you did.

966
00:40:48,340 --> 00:40:49,740
- I think I burped.

967
00:40:49,740 --> 00:40:50,580
- No, you didn't burp.

968
00:40:50,580 --> 00:40:51,400
- When I said that.

969
00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:52,240
- I think I burped.

970
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:53,080
- I know what a burp looks like in the lips.

971
00:40:53,080 --> 00:40:55,460
- I think every time that I was about to answer you,

972
00:40:55,460 --> 00:40:56,420
I burped.

973
00:40:56,420 --> 00:40:58,440
- Wrong, just so wrong.

974
00:40:58,440 --> 00:40:59,280
Anyway, I guess that was--

975
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:01,020
- I drank a seltzer in--

976
00:41:01,020 --> 00:41:02,420
- That was my question, you guys,

977
00:41:02,420 --> 00:41:03,900
just one of you guys go ahead,

978
00:41:03,900 --> 00:41:04,980
I'm gonna take some time.

979
00:41:04,980 --> 00:41:09,060
- Okay, this is a question from I Love Funny123

980
00:41:09,060 --> 00:41:11,980
that says, "What makes you guys go nuts in the bed?"

981
00:41:11,980 --> 00:41:13,180
(laughing)

982
00:41:13,180 --> 00:41:14,020
- Makes me go nuts in the bed.

983
00:41:14,020 --> 00:41:14,860
- I feel like we talked about that

984
00:41:14,860 --> 00:41:16,940
for the first 20 minutes of this episode.

985
00:41:16,940 --> 00:41:20,220
- I think we already covered this, I Love Funny123.

986
00:41:20,220 --> 00:41:22,160
- When my girl has sex with me.

987
00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:23,940
- True. - Ooh.

988
00:41:23,940 --> 00:41:26,220
- That makes me bust my nut, dude.

989
00:41:26,220 --> 00:41:29,620
- Oh my God, when my girl is hot as hell.

990
00:41:29,620 --> 00:41:33,420
- When my girl is one million feet tall.

991
00:41:33,420 --> 00:41:41,340
when I nut I bust everywhere. When I nut I bust. Nust if you butt. You know what makes me

994
00:41:53,780 --> 00:42:01,900

995
00:42:01,900 --> 00:42:08,140
bedroom as the battlefield I think the bedroom is the battlefield I am the I am

996
00:42:08,140 --> 00:42:14,780

00:42:31,960 --> 00:42:38,520
Normandy that's right me I'm a I'm a I'm a German soldier named Hans sitting on a

1001
00:42:38,520 --> 00:42:43,700
sitting on a turret and I'm killing all her friends but she makes it to me and

1002
00:42:43,700 --> 00:42:49,500
she sticks her knife in me oh I'm saying right in my heart yeah yeah yeah I'm

00:42:55,120 --> 00:43:01,600
the water. Well I do I hire a lot of extras for the roleplay. I hire about 4,000 older men. I try to hire

1005
00:43:01,600 --> 00:43:07,840
I try to hire actual veterans who survived storming the beaches of Normandy for full effect. So I have

1006
00:43:07,840 --> 00:43:14,240
anywhere between one and two hundred old men walking through my living room as fast as they can and just

1007
00:43:14,240 --> 00:43:20,160
pretending to keel over and die. Some of them actually do it. We don't check until I come and

1008
00:43:20,160 --> 00:43:22,840
And then, yeah, she makes it to the end,

1009
00:43:22,840 --> 00:43:27,340
and she saves, we call it saving my privates.

1010
00:43:27,340 --> 00:43:30,080
- Saving my privates, Ryan.

1011
00:43:30,080 --> 00:43:31,280
- Yeah.

1012
00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:32,120
- Yeah.

1013
00:43:32,120 --> 00:43:33,880
- It's pretty fun.

1014
00:43:33,880 --> 00:43:35,780
- I got an email here.

1015
00:43:35,780 --> 00:43:39,360
It says, "Good evening, gentlemen.

1016
00:43:39,360 --> 00:43:41,280

00:43:49,280 --> 00:43:52,200
in your Sullivan the Frog Enterprises LLC,

1021
00:43:52,200 --> 00:43:55,120
and would like to extend an offer to purchase your business.

1022
00:43:55,120 --> 00:43:56,520

producing your podcast,

1024
00:43:57,680 --> 00:44:00,080
albeit with a vastly increased budget.

1025
00:44:00,080 --> 00:44:01,640
You would have the bottomless coffers

1026
00:44:01,640 --> 00:44:05,480
of the Steve Jobs Coins for Cancer Fund at your disposal.

1027
00:44:05,480 --> 00:44:07,240
The possibilities would be endless,

1028
00:44:07,240 --> 00:44:09,080
and I look forward to hearing what you would add

1029
00:44:09,080 --> 00:44:10,960
to the show with such wealth.

1030
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:14,320
Sincerely, IEATA Big Poop.

1031
00:44:14,320 --> 00:44:16,760

1041

1042
00:44:36,900 --> 00:44:38,900
is that what i got a lot of twice

1043
00:44:38,900 --> 00:44:40,820
uh... it's that's that's that

1044
00:44:40,820 --> 00:44:45,060
yet crazy parents in my life and i think i think i think i think i think i think

1045
00:44:45,060 --> 00:44:52,340
It must be one of those things where he like moved from China to America and he just had

1046
00:44:52,340 --> 00:44:55,980
to do like an American name and he had a bunch.

1047
00:44:55,980 --> 00:45:00,240
He also had the same problem in China where he had five different first names.

1048
00:45:00,240 --> 00:45:05,140
He was going through immigration and they just threw a dart at a dart board five times.

1049
00:45:05,140 --> 00:45:07,180
They threw five darts.

1050
00:45:07,180 --> 00:45:11,700
And they threw one of the darts twice and it hit the same one.

1051
00:45:11,700 --> 00:45:15,040
Yeah, what, I guess, should we accept this offer

1052
00:45:15,040 --> 00:45:17,920
to be bought out by this mysterious company?

1053
00:45:17,920 --> 00:45:18,760
What would we--

1054
00:45:18,760 --> 00:45:19,600
- I'll never sell out 'cause it's not your problem.

1055
00:45:19,600 --> 00:45:22,040
- What could we add with that kind of money?

1056
00:45:22,040 --> 00:45:23,580
- I don't wanna add anything.

1057
00:45:23,580 --> 00:45:25,240
I think the show's perfect.

1058
00:45:25,240 --> 00:45:28,080
- Yeah, I think I'll never sell out and never be bought.

1059
00:45:28,080 --> 00:45:29,200
- You don't want to buy a big jacuzzi

1060
00:45:29,200 --> 00:45:30,480
to all record inside of?

1061
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:31,320
- Okay, hold on.

1062
00:45:31,320 --> 00:45:32,520
- I don't know, I mean, I guess if we could like--

1063
00:45:32,520 --> 00:45:33,360
- Hold on now.

1064
00:45:33,360 --> 00:45:34,180
- I guess if we could like--

1065
00:45:34,180 --> 00:45:35,160
- You didn't tell me there was gonna be a jacuzzi.

1066
00:45:35,160 --> 00:45:36,560
- I'm saying we could buy anything.

1067
00:45:36,560 --> 00:45:38,820
We have Steve Jobs coins.

1068
00:45:38,820 --> 00:45:40,680
- Are you saying there's a possibility

1069
00:45:40,680 --> 00:45:43,920
we could do forced plastic surgery on Patrick?

1070
00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:45,520
(laughing)

1071
00:45:45,520 --> 00:45:46,360
- No.

1072
00:45:46,360 --> 00:45:48,360
- I mean, it says the possibilities will be endless.

1073
00:45:48,360 --> 00:45:50,540
- Yeah, but I think it ends in jacuzzi.

1074
00:45:50,540 --> 00:45:53,840
- No, 'cause what's the, so we haven't unveiled this yet,

1075
00:45:53,840 --> 00:45:55,960
but if we get to Patreon of 15,000,

1076
00:45:55,960 --> 00:45:58,200
like that's our next goal after 10,

1077
00:45:58,200 --> 00:45:59,880
we're basically gonna install a vagina

1078
00:45:59,880 --> 00:46:02,000
between Pat's butthole and his balls.

1079
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:04,240
So, just so he has the option open.

1080
00:46:04,240 --> 00:46:05,080
- Yeah.

1081
00:46:05,080 --> 00:46:06,400
- And then after that, we were gonna get a jacuzzi.

1082
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:10,200
So basically we could accelerate what we call phase three.

1083
00:46:10,200 --> 00:46:11,040
- Yeah.

1084
00:46:11,040 --> 00:46:14,000
- We're gonna get, Patrick's penis is gonna be zip off-able

1085
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:15,800
like those pants that can turn into shorts.

1086
00:46:15,800 --> 00:46:16,720
- That's true.

1087
00:46:16,720 --> 00:46:18,800
- I have those pants and it's not,

1088
00:46:18,800 --> 00:46:20,120
you're not gonna want that.

1089
00:46:20,120 --> 00:46:21,040
- It'll also be reversible,

1090
00:46:21,040 --> 00:46:23,120
but the reverse side is gonna be really scary.

1091
00:46:23,120 --> 00:46:25,280
It's gonna be like the inside of a penis.

1092
00:46:25,280 --> 00:46:27,700
- A sharp piece of glass is what it looks like

1093
00:46:27,700 --> 00:46:28,840
when you turn it inside out.

1094
00:46:28,840 --> 00:46:32,520
- So I don't know, I mean, I guess we could use some like,

1095
00:46:32,520 --> 00:46:33,360
- We could get like,

1096
00:46:33,360 --> 00:46:34,200
- Round two funding, you know?

1097
00:46:34,200 --> 00:46:35,280
- Lunch or something.

1098
00:46:35,280 --> 00:46:37,360
- I was also thinking maybe we could bring the podcast

1099
00:46:37,360 --> 00:46:38,200
into the cloud.

1100
00:46:38,200 --> 00:46:39,020
- Yeah, I like that idea.

1101
00:46:39,020 --> 00:46:41,900
- Let's circle back to what Cameron said.

1102
00:46:41,900 --> 00:46:43,540
- Cameron, you're not making any sense.

1103
00:46:43,540 --> 00:46:46,140
- We, the possibilities are endless and we go get lunch.

1104
00:46:46,140 --> 00:46:48,220
- I'm the ideas man here, okay?

1105
00:46:48,220 --> 00:46:49,060
- Since when?

1106
00:46:49,060 --> 00:46:49,900
- I'm thinking that we-- - You've never come up

1107
00:46:49,900 --> 00:46:50,980
with an idea in your life.

1108
00:46:50,980 --> 00:46:53,220
- I'm in the-- - You're the inventions guy,

1109
00:46:53,220 --> 00:46:54,780
Cameron is the ideas guy.

1110
00:46:54,780 --> 00:46:55,620
- No. - Yes.

1111
00:46:55,620 --> 00:46:57,220
- I'm kinda like the-- - You're the guy.

1112
00:46:57,220 --> 00:46:59,140
- I'm kinda like the Patrick Swayze type.

1113
00:46:59,140 --> 00:47:00,620
- I'm actually all three of those.

1114
00:47:00,620 --> 00:47:02,460
- I'm kinda like the Patrick Swayze type

1115
00:47:02,460 --> 00:47:03,980
'cause I'm dying of cancer.

1116
00:47:03,980 --> 00:47:06,900
- None of you are guys, I'm the only guy.

1117
00:47:06,900 --> 00:47:12,320
Basically, I was thinking maybe we we we scale this thing up second podcast. Yeah

1118
00:47:12,320 --> 00:47:18,580
Stuff we fuck. Oh, yeah, we'll start a network. We'll start the soul network we fuck network

1119
00:47:18,580 --> 00:47:25,880
SWF network right and we take on we're taking on Legion of skanks

1120
00:47:25,880 --> 00:47:33,900
Right. So firstly we're absorbing crooked media as well. Yeah, we're taking crooked media and we get you do and you are gonna be so excited

1121
00:47:33,900 --> 00:47:35,900

Nerf gun game. Yeah, that's oh my god

1123
00:47:39,820 --> 00:47:43,620

00:47:43,620 --> 00:47:48,460
We're I would love to see that we're taking a cereal cereal. It's gotten bore. It's boring

1125
00:47:48,460 --> 00:47:54,220
Nobody cares about Bo Bergdahl or some fucking guy with a D and they don't even talk about cereal

1126
00:47:54,220 --> 00:48:00,400
And we're gonna be it's gonna be only every season's gonna be about the new cereals. It's new cereals

1127
00:48:00,400 --> 00:48:04,320
Do you think we could do you think we could pay Michelle Obama to do a guest spot?

1128
00:48:04,700 --> 00:48:10,180
Listen, I don't think there's any amount of money that Michelle Obama would be paid you can pay Michelle Obama

1129
00:48:10,180 --> 00:48:14,500
To do anything especially concerning spots, okay?

1130
00:48:14,500 --> 00:48:22,620
Yeah, I heard Michelle Obama was doing a set at the laugh. Actually Obama is a prostitute now. She's been no

1131
00:48:22,620 --> 00:48:29,740
No, she's not she'll suck and fuck for the right. Oh, no, that's not true. That's not true

1132
00:48:29,740 --> 00:48:34,480
I know cuz I had sex I believe a million times in a day. That's not true. It only cost me

1133
00:48:34,480 --> 00:48:42,080
40 quarters I'm serious I think $10 I think you I think you may be confused

1134
00:48:42,080 --> 00:48:50,880

1136
00:48:56,800 --> 00:49:08,440
in my love. I'm serious. I have a question. Yeah. Okay. Hey boys, I was wondering how

1137
00:49:08,440 --> 00:49:14,960
you guys deal with being bullied. Okay, this is a sincere one. That's kind of sad.

1138
00:49:14,960 --> 00:49:20,480
Recently at school, kids have been making fun of me a lot, calling me ugly, fat, and

1139
00:49:20,480 --> 00:49:25,200
pedophile. They sometimes kick me and throw rocks at me in the hall. And the

1140
00:49:25,200 --> 00:49:29,400
The other day Jessica wouldn't even let me have a bite of her sandwich at lunch, even

1141
00:49:29,400 --> 00:49:32,020
though I told her I forgot mine at home.

1142
00:49:32,020 --> 00:49:35,960
It's getting so bad I might not have anyone to ask to the fall dance.

1143
00:49:35,960 --> 00:49:39,960
If that happens, I might as well just give up and look for a different job.

1144
00:49:39,960 --> 00:49:43,600
Do you boys have any advice on dealing with bullies?

1145
00:49:43,600 --> 00:49:44,600
Love Patrick."

1146
00:49:44,600 --> 00:49:45,600
Different Patrick.

1147
00:49:45,600 --> 00:49:52,000
I don't know, it says Patrick in New Hampshire.

1148
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:53,400
It's a different guy.

1149
00:49:53,400 --> 00:49:54,400
Okay.

1150
00:49:54,400 --> 00:49:57,620
How do you know guys do this to me? How do you know? Yeah, how do you know?

1151
00:49:57,620 --> 00:50:03,440
I I'm going through so much and you all all you well, yeah, I mean clearly you're being bullied. Yeah. No

1152
00:50:03,440 --> 00:50:07,700
Yeah, you can also Pat. You don't have to go through this whole rigmarole of

1153
00:50:07,700 --> 00:50:13,340
Writing us an email. We're your friends. Just call us if you're having an issue at work. Yeah, I mean

1154
00:50:13,340 --> 00:50:16,320
Every day I get betrayed by you

1155
00:50:16,320 --> 00:50:21,720
Betrayed by me. I'm not the one bullying you. It seems like there's no bully the other kids

1156
00:50:21,760 --> 00:50:25,080
You're doing a you're doing a hit piece. There's not a hit piece

1157
00:50:25,080 --> 00:50:35,680
No, you're a dirty donkey

1158
00:50:35,680 --> 00:50:38,360
Stop it. No, you stop it. I

1159
00:50:38,360 --> 00:50:44,640
Do not like this you like you like it. You don't like being called out. I don't like why do you sign your

1160
00:50:44,640 --> 00:50:47,800
Why do you sign your emails? Hey, buddy, don't sign your emails. That's right

1161
00:50:47,800 --> 00:50:50,440
Yeah, that's right

1162
00:50:51,200 --> 00:50:53,200
As far as bullies just just

1163
00:50:53,200 --> 00:51:02,160
Every day I deal with two bullies every day. It's you yeah your parents. Yeah, you cuz you're twice the size of a normal person

1164
00:51:02,160 --> 00:51:03,960
Yeah, I'm huge

1165
00:51:03,960 --> 00:51:05,660
Yeah, I

1166
00:51:05,660 --> 00:51:07,000
know

1167
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:09,640
Yeah, you're not in the way that you're thinking

1168
00:51:09,640 --> 00:51:16,560
That makes no sense. Mm-hmm. Yeah, I got him. Let's get there. No, there's no air horns. Uh-huh. There's air horns

1169
00:51:18,440 --> 00:51:20,940
I have another question here.

1170
00:51:20,940 --> 00:51:23,520
This is from DarkSatanTheHater.

1171
00:51:23,520 --> 00:51:29,940
It says, "I hate you, I hate you, I hate your stupid show.

1172
00:51:29,940 --> 00:51:32,440
"Every single word you say makes me want to vomit barf

1173
00:51:32,440 --> 00:51:33,540
"out of my mouth.

1174
00:51:33,540 --> 00:51:36,140
"It makes me want to vacuum up every last drop of semen

1175
00:51:36,140 --> 00:51:37,980
"I've ever spilled back into my penis hole.

1176
00:51:37,980 --> 00:51:39,840
"That's how unpleasurable it is.

1177
00:51:39,840 --> 00:51:41,700
"I think that Patrick is a fat freak

1178
00:51:41,700 --> 00:51:45,020
"and Caleb is a bald bastard and Cameron is a gay girl.

1179
00:51:45,020 --> 00:51:46,460
"I have listened to all of your episodes

1180
00:51:46,460 --> 00:51:48,040
"and I have never smiled once.

1181
00:51:48,040 --> 00:51:52,140
"Your jokes are like nails on a chalkboard on the wall of a prison where I'm serving a life sentence.

1182
00:51:52,140 --> 00:51:54,340
"Why I'm serving a life sentence isn't important.

1183
00:51:54,340 --> 00:51:57,940
"The point is, I hate you, I hate you, I fucking hate you.

1184
00:51:57,940 --> 00:52:01,240
"When are you releasing the first 31 episodes?"

1185
00:52:01,240 --> 00:52:05,940
- Everyone's so mean to me. - Probably never.

1186
00:52:05,940 --> 00:52:09,540
- Everybody's so mean to me. - We should do a $100 Patreon tier.

1187
00:52:09,540 --> 00:52:12,740
- If you're in jail, you get them for free. - If you're in jail, yeah.

1188
00:52:12,740 --> 00:52:14,740
It's kind of a new program we're doing.

1189
00:52:14,740 --> 00:52:17,860
Yeah, we're trying to drive people in prison to suicide

1190
00:52:17,860 --> 00:52:23,380
Because by listening dirty scum so we're gonna give you the worst 31 episodes

1191
00:52:23,380 --> 00:52:28,660
Hopefully you're gonna hang yourself with a bed sheet and then we can be through with you the world could be through with you

1192
00:52:28,660 --> 00:52:35,940
Yeah, that's what happened to jeffrey epstein. He had the third first 31 episodes. That's true. I'm down hillary clinton wanted them so bad

1193
00:52:35,940 --> 00:52:38,340
Yeah

1194
00:52:38,340 --> 00:52:42,420
Pat do you have another question? Yeah, I do. I have one here from voodoo chip

1195
00:52:43,140 --> 00:52:44,740
- Okay, love them.

1196
00:52:44,740 --> 00:52:48,940
- This one says, "Hello, I'm a huge fan and a long time,

1197
00:52:48,940 --> 00:52:50,820
"and I love your Twitch stream.

1198
00:52:50,820 --> 00:52:53,760
"When you guys started Chappo Trap Host,

1199
00:52:53,760 --> 00:52:56,660
"did you expect it to get as big as it is now?"

1200
00:52:56,660 --> 00:52:58,220
- Yes, we knew from the very beginning.

1201
00:52:58,220 --> 00:53:00,020
- Yeah, we knew this was gonna be huge.

1202
00:53:00,020 --> 00:53:01,700
- We knew so much that we started it

1203
00:53:01,700 --> 00:53:03,780
and then we just, we moved on to the next project.

1204
00:53:03,780 --> 00:53:05,780
We let those other jokers take over.

1205
00:53:05,780 --> 00:53:07,300
- Yeah. - Yeah.

1206
00:53:07,300 --> 00:53:08,860
- We let them do it.

1207
00:53:08,860 --> 00:53:10,260
- Those guys are my brother's friends,

1208
00:53:10,260 --> 00:53:11,620
and I just, when they told him, I was like,

1209
00:53:11,620 --> 00:53:15,620
Hey, do you guys want to run some fucking podcast?

1210
00:53:15,620 --> 00:53:18,500
Yeah, can you guys just don't fuck it up?

1211
00:53:18,500 --> 00:53:20,440
Yeah, and they've done all right.

1212
00:53:20,440 --> 00:53:21,280
Not great.

1213
00:53:21,280 --> 00:53:22,480
There's different things.

1214
00:53:22,480 --> 00:53:24,500
For example, things that I would do differently.

1215
00:53:24,500 --> 00:53:26,340
For example, I would have made it more of a

1216
00:53:26,340 --> 00:53:28,500
Republican conservative kind of podcast.

1217
00:53:28,500 --> 00:53:29,360
(laughing)

1218
00:53:29,360 --> 00:53:30,660
That's what I would have done.

1219
00:53:30,660 --> 00:53:32,340
But you know what?

1220
00:53:32,340 --> 00:53:34,220
It's not my baby anymore, it's theirs.

1221
00:53:34,220 --> 00:53:37,220
So I respect those fucking commie homos

1222
00:53:37,220 --> 00:53:39,580
to do whatever they want.

1223
00:53:41,220 --> 00:53:43,420
- Yeah, they have their thing, we have our thing.

1224
00:53:43,420 --> 00:53:44,460
- Yeah, you know.

1225
00:53:44,460 --> 00:53:46,940
- And they're kind of exactly diametrically opposed.

1226
00:53:46,940 --> 00:53:48,940
You know, they're good and we are evil.

1227
00:53:48,940 --> 00:53:50,940
I think that's, we've kind of set that up

1228
00:53:50,940 --> 00:53:54,420
as the dynamic there.

1229
00:53:54,420 --> 00:53:56,540
- But thank you for the question, Voodoo Chip.

1230
00:53:56,540 --> 00:53:57,780
- Thank you for the question.

1231
00:53:57,780 --> 00:53:58,620
- The question.

1232
00:53:58,620 --> 00:53:59,440
(laughs)

1233
00:53:59,440 --> 00:54:00,280
Thank you for the question.

1234
00:54:00,280 --> 00:54:02,300
- Thank you for all the questions.

1235
00:54:02,300 --> 00:54:04,700
This is one, this is a short one.

1236
00:54:04,700 --> 00:54:07,300
- If it's to me, please don't read it.

1237
00:54:07,300 --> 00:54:08,140
- No, it's not.

1238
00:54:08,140 --> 00:54:11,040
This is, what's the scariest thing you can think of?

1239
00:54:11,040 --> 00:54:13,040
That's from The Terrifier.

1240
00:54:13,040 --> 00:54:15,040
(laughter)

1241
00:54:15,040 --> 00:54:17,040
(laughter)

1242
00:54:17,040 --> 00:54:19,040
(laughter)

1243
00:54:19,040 --> 00:54:21,040
(laughter)

1244
00:54:21,040 --> 00:54:23,040
(laughter)

1245
00:54:23,040 --> 00:54:25,040
(laughter)

1246
00:54:25,040 --> 00:54:27,040
I don't know if we should tell him.

1247
00:54:27,040 --> 00:54:29,040
No, I, you know what?

1248
00:54:29,040 --> 00:54:31,040
I have an idea.

1249
00:54:31,040 --> 00:54:33,040
I have an idea. The scariest thing

1250
00:54:33,040 --> 00:54:35,040
I can think of is a

1251
00:54:35,040 --> 00:54:37,040
bunch of ice cream.

1252
00:54:37,040 --> 00:54:39,040
A ton of ice cream and a huge

1253
00:54:39,040 --> 00:54:45,480
huge blowjob. Yeah, a blowjob from the sloppiest mouth I've ever seen. A blowjob from the ice

1254
00:54:45,480 --> 00:54:52,480
cream man. Yeah, and all of the Halloween candy in the world. Uh huh. Yeah, so, Terrifier.

1255
00:54:52,480 --> 00:55:01,980
I hope that's it. That's right.

1256
00:55:01,980 --> 00:55:09,980
*laughing*

1257
00:55:09,980 --> 00:55:13,980
Terrifier, I hope you don't do that.

1258
00:55:13,980 --> 00:55:22,980
*laughing*

1259
00:55:22,980 --> 00:55:25,980
It's the hardest I've laughed in like at least a month.

1260
00:55:25,980 --> 00:55:29,980
*laughing*

1261
00:55:29,980 --> 00:55:31,980
Okay, alright, what's the next question?

1262
00:55:31,980 --> 00:55:33,980
Cameron, do you have another question?

1263
00:55:33,980 --> 00:55:35,980
Yeah, yeah, no, I got one.

1264
00:55:35,980 --> 00:55:37,980
This is from Curious Carl.

1265
00:55:37,980 --> 00:55:39,980
"Kid!"

1266
00:55:39,980 --> 00:55:41,980
[laughter]

1267
00:55:41,980 --> 00:55:43,980
"Would you rather

1268
00:55:43,980 --> 00:55:45,980
fly a plane or sail a boat?

1269
00:55:45,980 --> 00:55:47,980
The plane has a Playstation 2

1270
00:55:47,980 --> 00:55:49,980
built into the control panel, but the boat

1271
00:55:49,980 --> 00:55:51,980
has every GameCube game ever made.

1272
00:55:51,980 --> 00:55:53,980
If you choose the plane, there's a 10% chance

1273
00:55:53,980 --> 00:55:55,980
9/11 happens, but if you choose

1274
00:55:55,980 --> 00:55:57,980
the boat, there's a 20% chance 9/11 happens.

1275
00:55:57,980 --> 00:56:01,540
happens but you're on a boat so it doesn't matter also if you're on the

1276
00:56:01,540 --> 00:56:05,180
boat you get to sing I'm on a boat and T-Pain is there T-Pain is also on the

1277
00:56:05,180 --> 00:56:08,720
plane but you can't sing with him and if the plane does get hijacked he'll start

1278
00:56:08,720 --> 00:56:13,820
crying Oh boat then are you kidding yeah I'd be I'd be on the boat I would I

1279
00:56:13,820 --> 00:56:19,060
would I would pitch my you guys don't want to see T-Pain cry I want you to

1280
00:56:19,060 --> 00:56:25,540
pitch a parody song of I'm on a boat to T-Pain yeah called I got a goat I got

1281
00:56:25,540 --> 00:56:31,080
Well if he's on the boat you can't pitch anything to him you can only sing with him.

1282
00:56:31,080 --> 00:56:32,900
You can't talk to him.

1283
00:56:32,900 --> 00:56:35,540
So I'll just start singing I Got a Goat.

1284
00:56:35,540 --> 00:56:37,620
Can you pitch to any other people on the boat?

1285
00:56:37,620 --> 00:56:39,620
There's nobody else on the boat.

1286
00:56:39,620 --> 00:56:41,580
So it's just you and T-Pain you can't pitch?

1287
00:56:41,580 --> 00:56:42,580
Yep.

1288
00:56:42,580 --> 00:56:43,580
No pitches allowed.

1289
00:56:43,580 --> 00:56:44,580
The plane is filled with a lot of people.

1290
00:56:44,580 --> 00:56:46,100
Not even a cartoon.

1291
00:56:46,100 --> 00:56:47,980
Mr. Wonderful's on the plane too.

1292
00:56:47,980 --> 00:56:50,080
Is Mr. Wonderful on the boat?

1293
00:56:50,080 --> 00:56:52,740
Because if Mr. Wonderful's on the boat there's going to be a big problem.

1294
00:56:52,740 --> 00:56:54,740
Mr. Wonderful's not on the boat.

1295
00:56:54,740 --> 00:56:57,340
I believe it was his wife that did the thing on the boat.

1296
00:56:57,340 --> 00:56:58,740
Is his wife on the boat?

1297
00:56:58,740 --> 00:57:00,140
No, his wife is...

1298
00:57:00,140 --> 00:57:01,140
Does she drive?

1299
00:57:01,140 --> 00:57:06,060
Wait, no, because T-Pain and I are going to be singing, so who's driving the boat?

1300
00:57:06,060 --> 00:57:09,980
Let me message Curious Carl right now.

1301
00:57:09,980 --> 00:57:10,980
Okay, thank you.

1302
00:57:10,980 --> 00:57:13,340
Curious Carl, who will be driving the boat?

1303
00:57:13,340 --> 00:57:16,380
Oh, he says me.

1304
00:57:16,380 --> 00:57:17,380
So I think Curious Carl will be the one.

1305
00:57:17,380 --> 00:57:19,580
Can you ask him if he's a good boat pilot?

1306
00:57:19,580 --> 00:57:20,980
Are you a good boat pilot?

1307
00:57:20,980 --> 00:57:21,980
Wait, hold on.

1308
00:57:21,980 --> 00:57:26,340
Chris Carl is their last name wonderful?

1309
00:57:26,340 --> 00:57:29,060
One question at a time for this guy.

1310
00:57:29,060 --> 00:57:30,060
He says...

1311
00:57:30,060 --> 00:57:31,060
Are you a girl?

1312
00:57:31,060 --> 00:57:32,060
Are you a girl?

1313
00:57:32,060 --> 00:57:33,060
No.

1314
00:57:33,060 --> 00:57:34,060
Is your last name wonderful?

1315
00:57:34,060 --> 00:57:35,060
Yes.

1316
00:57:35,060 --> 00:57:36,060
Oh, shit.

1317
00:57:36,060 --> 00:57:37,540
Okay, I'm taking the plane.

1318
00:57:37,540 --> 00:57:38,540
Yeah?

1319
00:57:38,540 --> 00:57:41,900
Because I don't want to die on the boat and also 9/11 to happen.

1320
00:57:41,900 --> 00:57:42,900
I'm gonna...

1321
00:57:42,900 --> 00:57:45,260
You'd rather just get it over with in one fell swoop?

1322
00:57:45,260 --> 00:57:46,260
But I think...

1323
00:57:46,260 --> 00:57:47,260
I feel like you guys are thinking about the place...

1324
00:57:47,260 --> 00:57:48,260
I think there's probably a 100% chance.

1325
00:57:48,260 --> 00:57:50,060
Which is better, PS2 or GameCube?

1326
00:57:50,060 --> 00:57:51,940
I'm going with the boat because of GameCube.

1327
00:57:51,940 --> 00:57:54,140
- Yeah, I guess I'm-- - And that's my final offer.

1328
00:57:54,140 --> 00:57:56,220
- 'Cause at least, if I'm dying on both,

1329
00:57:56,220 --> 00:57:58,340
I'm gonna enjoy my last couple moments

1330
00:57:58,340 --> 00:58:00,660
playing Super Monkey Ball.

1331
00:58:00,660 --> 00:58:01,540
- Yeah, if I'm on the plane,

1332
00:58:01,540 --> 00:58:03,700
I can jump off before 9/11 happens.

1333
00:58:03,700 --> 00:58:06,280
- If I'm on the boat, I can swim the shore.

1334
00:58:06,280 --> 00:58:09,380
- Yeah, the boat is in a pool, so there's--

1335
00:58:09,380 --> 00:58:10,820
(laughing)

1336
00:58:10,820 --> 00:58:11,660
- Oh, we're fine then.

1337
00:58:11,660 --> 00:58:13,820
If it's just sitting in a pool, it's just a house.

1338
00:58:13,820 --> 00:58:16,180
- But it's in a pool of acid.

1339
00:58:16,180 --> 00:58:17,620
- Oh, then I'm not taking the boat.

1340
00:58:17,620 --> 00:58:19,500
I'm getting on the plane.

1341
00:58:19,500 --> 00:58:20,340
- The plane's made of acid. - I'm still gonna go

1342
00:58:20,340 --> 00:58:21,180
in the boat.

1343
00:58:21,180 --> 00:58:27,660
plane is a fire then I'm getting back on the boat the boat is in the plane okay

1344
00:58:27,660 --> 00:58:32,320
then I'm gonna get on the plane cuz I'm one layer closer to the outside of the

1345
00:58:32,320 --> 00:58:40,160
plane look I'm just trying to get close to God do I have a parachute you do on

1346
00:58:40,160 --> 00:58:43,500

successfully hacked into your podcast mailbag episode there's nothing you can

1360
01:00:19,420 --> 01:00:23,660
do now in precisely 24 hours every piece of personal data you have will be leaked

1361
01:00:23,660 --> 01:00:27,140
onto the little web and if you're stupid enough to still be reading this your

1362
01:00:27,140 --> 01:00:30,440
voice has been scanned and will be synthesized into a deep fake confessing

1363
01:00:30,440 --> 01:00:34,340
to the heretofore unsolved Zodiac murders and the planning of various terrorist

1364
01:00:34,340 --> 01:00:39,140
acts. Any last words? Oh I probably shouldn't have read that.

1365
01:00:39,140 --> 01:00:45,060
Now that I think about it. Why'd you read that? I didn't hear it so I'm safe. I don't really

1366
01:00:45,060 --> 01:00:48,580
care about my personal information. Well I've been thinking of getting rid of it

1367
01:00:48,580 --> 01:00:53,740
anyway. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah I've been thinking of selling it. Yeah to the highest bidder.

1368
01:00:53,740 --> 01:00:58,100
But it's I mean, you know, I wouldn't I wouldn't have drawn a lot of money. So it's fine little gamer

01:00:58,100 --> 01:01:01,260
You have it the little web can have it. I don't really care very much

01:01:41,380 --> 01:01:43,220
- Type down, you're already too uppity.

1387
01:01:43,220 --> 01:01:46,580
