00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:13,600
[Music]

2
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:21,360
So, you guys, um, so you guys were enjoying living with the uncle Robleg-

3
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:24,000
Can I ever say his name right?

4
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,040
Blagojevich.

5
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:25,920
Blagojevich.

6
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:27,120
Blah-boblio.

7
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:27,760
Yeah, hey.

8
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:28,800
Bob-blah-blah.

9
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:30,800
Bob Lob Lob Lob Lob

10
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:37,360
John Cena and the other nephews. Yeah, did you guys ever watch the rest of development?

11
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:42,080
Yeah, and

12
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:47,120
Then they dropped you off at the at uncle uncle shredders farm. Yeah, and

13
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:49,800
Then there was a break-in

14
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:56,480
Looks like Joe Pesci and Skeletor. We're trying to capture. Yeah, or Jafar. It wasn't really confirmed whether it was

15
00:00:57,400 --> 00:01:02,560
I feel like and yeah, I feel like we didn't really couldn't get a clear look at him. Yeah. Yeah, it's hard

16
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:06,240
it was hard to tell in the dark in the dark of the game and

17
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:10,840
Shredder said he'd seen this before and

18
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:13,560
sent you guys on a

19
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:20,640
Motorbike with two sidecars one that was a hamster ball and one of them is filled with candy. It's filled with candy

20
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:26,040
Yeah, I think Cameron has opted to fly. I mentioned. I think I licked Skeletor's asshole for quite a while

21
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:33,040
Yes, also normal member really it was 15 minutes ago. Yeah, yeah normal talk like skeletons asshole. Yeah, uh-huh

22
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:41,320
So now you guys are on the road trying to drive to Duluth yeah, so

23
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:48,320
I'm gonna have you all roll straight intelligence checks just to see if you can read signs

24
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:52,000
Because you are 18

25
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:59,560
I'm a dog. What am I pretty smart? So just whatever and then plus intelligence. Yeah. Oh, no 10. Mm-hmm

26
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:06,160
Where is it? It's on the left side. It's zero. So I just got an 11. Okay, cool

27
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:10,440
And what'd you get

28
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:16,200
18. All right, cool. So you two, you know with your and we can kind of make out letters

29
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:19,480
It's hard to tell though, but pleasant parrot. Yeah

30
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:24,580
You're you're pretty much able to tell kind of where things are where to go

31
00:02:24,580 --> 00:02:31,180
And you're able to kind of help steer things. Are you driving the motorbike - or is the I think I'm flying a bit

32
00:02:31,180 --> 00:02:35,160
So you're helping so yeah, I'm pointing. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah

33
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:41,180
Yeah, no, I love you, all right, then I'll do it

34
00:02:41,180 --> 00:02:46,120
So yeah, the power of love he guides you guys a little bit closer to Duluth

35
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:49,480
Because that's what being pleasant is, is saying you love your friends.

36
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:53,480
Yeah, it's very pleasant to be around. But then suddenly it's like...

37
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:55,480
Oh.

38
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:57,080
And the bike starts to stall.

39
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:58,360
Patrick farted again.

40
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:02,360
And the bike starts to stall a little bit.

41
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:04,440
The hungry hamster didn't fart and I did it.

42
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:10,600
And it's in the middle of like a road that is sort of like very wooded area,

43
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:13,760
You've got lots of woods around you,

44
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:17,940
and the motor car with the two side cars breaks down.

45
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:22,860
You can either try to push the car a little bit further.

46
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:25,700
You know, Perry, 'cause of that role,

47
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:30,180
you're able to tell that a town is probably 10 miles away,

48
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:32,000
so you could push through.

49
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,320
It'd be tough, but you could do it.

50
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:34,960
- I think we have to set up camp.

51
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:37,320
- Or you can go into the woods, set up camp,

52
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:38,580
and figure things out from there.

53
00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:40,980
We have to set the bike on fire immediately.

54
00:03:40,980 --> 00:03:44,420
Hungry Hamster you should jump on my back and we just walk into town.

55
00:03:44,420 --> 00:03:48,780
Alright, so we gotta set the bike on fire.

56
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:50,700
What about your candy?

57
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:51,700
I ate all of it.

58
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:52,700
He absolutely ate all of it, yes.

59
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:53,700
Oh, I was, I guess I didn't look.

60
00:03:53,700 --> 00:04:01,620
My eyes were closed when I said that.

61
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:03,620
Well we gotta set the bike on fire immediately.

62
00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:06,340
Okay, alright, shoot the gas can.

63
00:04:06,340 --> 00:04:08,020
I saw this on Mythbusters.

64
00:04:08,020 --> 00:04:10,700
- Okay, do you have a gun?

65
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:12,180
- So you have-- - I don't have a gun.

66
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:14,980
- Hungry Hamster, you have check inventory.

67
00:04:14,980 --> 00:04:16,020
- Oh right, okay.

68
00:04:16,020 --> 00:04:18,020
- So roll a D20 and I'll let you know

69
00:04:18,020 --> 00:04:20,520
if you pull out something that can destroy the car.

70
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:22,300
- I got a 19.

71
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:24,060
- Okay, one second, let me pull up--

72
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:25,700
- Wait, 19 plus anything?

73
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:26,540
- No, just 19.

74
00:04:26,540 --> 00:04:27,380
- Okay.

75
00:04:27,380 --> 00:04:30,340
- Let me pull up the table I made for you.

76
00:04:30,340 --> 00:04:34,760
Oh God.

77
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:37,540
Okay.

78
00:04:37,540 --> 00:04:39,680
- Okay, this is awkward.

79
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:41,680
- Okay, this is a little weird.

80
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:43,020
- That awkward moment.

81
00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:44,280
- You said 19, right?

82
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:45,120
- Yeah.

83
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:51,180
- Okay, you pull out of the bag a beehive.

84
00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:54,100
- What?

85
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:55,540
(laughing)

86
00:04:55,540 --> 00:04:56,600
- I got 19.

87
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:58,060
- Yeah, you pull out a full beehive.

88
00:04:58,060 --> 00:04:59,600
That's what's on the list here.

89
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:02,460
(laughing)

90
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:04,100
- It's not gonna help at all.

91
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:06,020
- Shoot the bees out of your mouth.

92
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:10,580
Put 'em in your cheeks and then shoot 'em at the gas can.

93
00:05:10,580 --> 00:05:13,300
I'll let you try to do that if you're all athletics.

94
00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:14,840
Well, what if I just

95
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:17,260
stuff the motor with a beehive?

96
00:05:17,260 --> 00:05:21,200
I'll let you try that too. Explain what that could mean.

97
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:27,220
Stuff the motor with a beehive.

98
00:05:27,220 --> 00:05:30,020
The thing is I understood what he meant too.

99
00:05:30,020 --> 00:05:32,400
I did not.

100
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:33,220
I said I'll let you try that.

101
00:05:33,220 --> 00:05:35,220
I was like, "Oh yeah, that would blow up the bike."

102
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:37,220
[laughter]

103
00:05:37,220 --> 00:05:39,220
I've seen stuff on TV.

104
00:05:39,220 --> 00:05:41,220
So you're gonna cap the gas can.

105
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:43,220
No, you know what?

106
00:05:43,220 --> 00:05:45,220
Mr. Motor over here.

107
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:47,220
One of us would have to turn on the bike,

108
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:49,220
and I don't want one of us to explode.

109
00:05:49,220 --> 00:05:51,220
I'll do it!

110
00:05:51,220 --> 00:05:53,220
I put the beehive in my mouth, whole thing.

111
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:55,220
Okay.

112
00:05:55,220 --> 00:05:57,220
Whole damn thing. And I shoot all the bees

113
00:05:57,220 --> 00:05:59,220
at the engine.

114
00:05:59,220 --> 00:06:01,220
Okay, I guess

115
00:06:01,220 --> 00:06:07,580
that's gonna be cool it's gonna be cool for sure it's gonna be really cool I'll

116
00:06:07,580 --> 00:06:12,140
let that be a constitution and then an attack roll constitution is just to see

117
00:06:12,140 --> 00:06:15,580
if you can maintain the bees and the beehive all that in your mouth you tell

118
00:06:15,580 --> 00:06:18,780
the bees not to sting you before you put them in. These bees can be pretty high. We can speak to them

119
00:06:18,780 --> 00:06:27,100
because they're animals okay so some of you may die. That's 12. Okay so you're not

120
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:30,300
really able to keep the beehive in your mouth it's sort of like they start to get

121
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:33,300
and you start like sort of moving around in your mouth.

122
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:34,300
Move it up!

123
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:38,300
So I'm going to say you could do the attack roll on the motor, but with disadvantage.

124
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:40,300
Okay, so what do I roll?

125
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:42,300
Roll a d20 and add your dexterity.

126
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:44,300
So then add dexterity?

127
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:45,300
Yeah.

128
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:46,300
So it's nine.

129
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:47,300
And then roll again.

130
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:48,300
Wait, wait, wait.

131
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:49,300
Twice.

132
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:50,300
Hold on.

133
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:52,300
Is that six or a nine?

134
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:54,300
The dot is at the bottom, so that's a six.

135
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:55,300
Okay, so.

136
00:06:55,300 --> 00:06:56,300
No, well, oh, you mean the butt?

137
00:06:56,300 --> 00:06:58,300
Like the circle or the circle B?

138
00:06:58,300 --> 00:07:02,300
The little dot is where the bottom of the number would be, right?

139
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:03,300
Yes.

140
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:04,300
Yeah.

141
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:05,300
Oh, so that's a six?

142
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:06,300
I apologize.

143
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:07,300
So it's an eight.

144
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:08,300
Okay, roll again because you have disadvantage.

145
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:11,300
You take the lower number.

146
00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:14,300
Oh, that's lower.

147
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:17,300
That's right, he rolled it off the goddamn stool.

148
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:18,300
Yeah, so it would be eight.

149
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:19,300
Yeah, it's an eight.

150
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:23,300
Yeah, so you just shoot the beehive out of your mouth and it just sort of like plops

151
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:26,300
like three and a half feet in front of you.

152
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:28,300
It's covered in your spit.

153
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:30,300
And the bees are mad at you.

154
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:34,300
Yeah, yeah. The bees are starting to sort of get a little bit angry.

155
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:36,300
Quick, let's go to town!

156
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:38,300
We gotta run!

157
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:39,300
Okay.

158
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:40,300
I'll be my bat.

159
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:41,300
I'll do that.

160
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:43,300
We're in the town or the woods? Where are you guys going?

161
00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:45,300
I love the big city.

162
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:47,300
I wanna go on a shopping spree.

163
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:49,300
I get on normal dogs back too.

164
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:51,300
Okay, so you're both on normal dogs back.

165
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:53,300
You can fly, you fucking freeloading piece of shit.

166
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:55,300
I just love being close to you.

167
00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:57,300
Get the fuck off me, you freak!

168
00:07:57,300 --> 00:07:58,300
I love you.

169
00:07:58,300 --> 00:08:00,300
I don't like him because he doesn't have a human asshole.

170
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:02,300
Yeah, there is now just like a motor--

171
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:05,300
Abandoned motorbike and a beehive

172
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:08,300
covered in saliva in the middle of the road.

173
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:10,300
Not our problem.

174
00:08:10,300 --> 00:08:13,300
And you guys walk into town.

175
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:15,300
You walk into the town of Brooklyn.

176
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:18,300
What the fuck?

177
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:20,300
How did we get there?

178
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:22,300
Of Brooklyn, Wisconsin.

179
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:30,940
And it's sort of a small city, about a thousand square feet, and everybody's sort of living

180
00:08:30,940 --> 00:08:31,940
on top of each other.

181
00:08:31,940 --> 00:08:34,700
You know how cities are.

182
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:41,140
And there's a bar, not a tavern, of course not.

183
00:08:41,140 --> 00:08:49,140
There's a bar, there's an auto repair shop, there's a few houses where residents live,

184
00:08:49,140 --> 00:08:51,820
a grocery store, bunch of other shit.

185
00:08:51,820 --> 00:08:58,820
A mayor's office, so you're in this town, it's bustling, you're three sort of lone animals,

186
00:08:58,820 --> 00:09:03,180
it's kind of early in the morning, like 7, 7.30, not too many people are out and about

187
00:09:03,180 --> 00:09:04,180
right now.

188
00:09:04,180 --> 00:09:09,660
But yeah, right now a parrot, a hamster, and a dog walk in.

189
00:09:09,660 --> 00:09:12,700
Let's get a chopped cheese!

190
00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:13,700
Do we order, yeah do we order anything?

191
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:15,980
You can get a chopped cheese, where do you want to go to the...

192
00:09:15,980 --> 00:09:18,020
Oh I can't wait to go to the famous Brooklyn Bodega.

193
00:09:18,020 --> 00:09:18,860
- Let's go to the Bodega.

194
00:09:18,860 --> 00:09:19,700
- Let's go to the Bodega.

195
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:21,020
- You're gonna go to Brooklyn Bodega?

196
00:09:21,020 --> 00:09:21,860
- Yeah. - Yeah.

197
00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:22,680
- We're gonna go to the Bodega.

198
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:23,980
- You go to the Brooklyn Bodega,

199
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:27,300
which is a massive, massive establishment.

200
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:31,340
Yeah, it's about 40 feet high and 40 feet deep.

201
00:09:31,340 --> 00:09:33,380
It's a perfect mecca cube.

202
00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:34,380
- Perfect Bodega.

203
00:09:34,380 --> 00:09:37,980
- And it's massive, 40 feet.

204
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:41,140
And so you go in, you see a guy there.

205
00:09:41,140 --> 00:09:43,340
He sees three animals walk in,

206
00:09:43,340 --> 00:09:45,500
two of them sitting on top of the other.

207
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:48,100
and he turns to his son, he's like,

208
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:51,400
"Mikey, get rid of these guys,

209
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:52,780
"get rid of these animals out of here."

210
00:09:52,780 --> 00:09:54,460
You see sort of a, "Oh, okay, dad."

211
00:09:54,460 --> 00:09:56,300
And sort of a gangly kid starts to comes out

212
00:09:56,300 --> 00:09:58,380
and starts to push you guys out with a broom

213
00:09:58,380 --> 00:10:00,160
'cause you're just three animals.

214
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:03,140
So what do you wanna do?

215
00:10:03,140 --> 00:10:05,420
- I use whimper.

216
00:10:05,420 --> 00:10:07,100
- Okay, now we're talking.

217
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:10,140
- I'm gonna charm this target.

218
00:10:10,140 --> 00:10:11,380
- You're gonna charm a boy?

219
00:10:11,380 --> 00:10:13,820
- Yeah, so with, I take it back.

220
00:10:13,820 --> 00:10:16,220
He's not a boy, he's like twenty-something.

221
00:10:16,220 --> 00:10:18,220
Yeah, he's like twenty-something.

222
00:10:18,220 --> 00:10:21,420
So you can charm a target of any species with this ability.

223
00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:24,420
Roll 1d20 plus a relevant charisma skill.

224
00:10:24,420 --> 00:10:27,420
So, what kind of whimpering are you doing?

225
00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:29,420
Uh, sensual.

226
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:30,420

You have to look at me.

00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:40,920
So...

235
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:42,920
I do have to look at you, the fucking dungeon master.

236
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:47,920
Roll a persuasion, add your persuasion to this.

00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:53,000

00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:44,560
I do a back flip too.

295
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:45,560
You do a back flip.

296
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:46,560
I put my head on the ground.

297
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:47,560
In the ground.

298
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:48,560
In the ground.

299
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:49,560
In the ground.

300
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:50,560
In the ground.

301
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:51,560
In the ground.

302
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:52,560
In the ground.

303
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:53,560
In the ground.

304
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:54,560
In the ground.

305
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:55,560
In the ground.

306
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:59,560
put my head on the gum area. Nobody sees you do it.

307
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:03,560
You're just where the trident is. I start wagging my tail. That's a yes.

308
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:07,560
Yeah, yeah. He hands you the, he's like, "Oh, alright." I fly down and I

309
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:11,560
start eating bites off the other end of it while Caleb's eating it. I hope I'm eating the middle.

310
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:15,560
You guys are eating the chopped cheese, uh, uh, uh, and uh,

311
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:19,560
the sun is like, "Aw, Dad, maybe we can keep them for a little bit

312
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:23,560
while they're here. At least until they get to going where they're going."

313
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:26,060
They do seem to be on some sort of journey

314
00:14:26,060 --> 00:14:31,020
And dad's like oh, all right. Why not my weird son?

315
00:14:31,020 --> 00:14:39,600
Yeah, he started the dad sort of walked out from behind the counter and opens the door to sort of the back room

316
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:42,940
And you see like there's like a little doggy bed and a birdcage

317
00:14:42,940 --> 00:14:46,960
And a hamster cage. It's like it's tailor-made for us

318
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:53,360
Well, you know we should do nothing but trust them I call the birdcage

319
00:14:53,360 --> 00:15:03,460
So yeah, you guys have like a little abode now in the town of Brooklyn, but um, you're still pretty far from Duluth so

320
00:15:03,460 --> 00:15:08,440
Getting there on foot is gonna be tough. I've got an idea now that we're in Brooklyn

321
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:11,320
Let's start a podcast

322
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:20,040
Yeah, we go to Radio Shack to get podcasting.

323
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:21,040
Okay, yeah.

324
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:22,040
So, I'm trying to think of what...

325
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:23,040
This is our way out.

326
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:29,040
Yeah, you guys head over to a Radio Shack.

327
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:30,040

00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:31,040
Oh, fuck.

329
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:32,040
Then you guys go...

330
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:33,040
When did this happen?

331
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:34,040
Let's go to Animal Radio Shack.

332
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:40,040
You guys go to Animal Radio Shack, thriving.

333
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:43,640
It's a little door on the bottom of the...

334

345
00:16:49,920 --> 00:17:01,760
Compare to us. That means huge. She looks like one of the two broke girls.

346
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:07,640
Okay. The stacked one. Okay. That's right. Yeah. How do you like that? I like that.

347
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:15,440
Yeah, except her face is upside down. I don't like that a little bit. And yeah, she goes out to the back and she gets out

348
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:18,080
three

349
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:26,640
Audio Technica mics, okay, and XLR cables and a Zoom H6 audio recorder.

350
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:29,880
And she says, "Let me get you a fourth one in case you want to torture someone."

351
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:36,880
one.

352
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:43,640
Okay, that's good enough for me. We can leave.

353
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:47,640
That'll do it.

354
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:53,000
So yeah, she leaves confused with the mic. You leave her confused with the mics in her hands.

355
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,520
And uh, yeah. So,

356
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:56,960
Duluth is

357
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:58,560
a little bit far away.

358
00:17:58,560 --> 00:18:00,680
part of the thing is that it is a tour

359
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:03,520
so they might leave Duluth and then...

360
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:07,360
so time is of the essence. Is there a travel agent in Brooklyn?

361
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:11,000
No, there is not. What the hell? It's 2020.

362
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,480
What kind of city is this? I thought it was 2003.

363
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:16,760
It's always... it's a bit... it's somewhere between there.

364
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:19,100
Travel agents aren't the thing anymore. It's 2000 and X.

365
00:18:19,100 --> 00:18:22,200
2000 and X. Alright, is there a...

366
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:26,920
Is there a guy who loves sending animals to places? Yeah. Is there a guy who likes to tell you

367
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:30,200
where to travel. There's never a circus. Hey, you know what?

368
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:33,760
Roll an investigation check. Okay, I'm really good at investigation. You're

369
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:38,440
looking for... what are you looking for exactly? A guy who can help you, but in what way? Or

370
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:42,280
just a guy who can help you? I think a guy who can who can help us figure out how

371
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:48,120
to get there. Yeah. A transportation guy. Yeah. That is a...

372
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:56,160
11. Okay, yeah. So you can't really pinpoint exactly where somebody is with

373
00:18:56,160 --> 00:19:00,240
in 11. But you get the sense that like, at the very least, there

374
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:04,740
is a, you know, there's a tavern in like a town square and like

375
00:19:04,740 --> 00:19:07,580
between those two places, there's enough people there, you

376
00:19:07,580 --> 00:19:10,280
can maybe find out where somebody is. Yeah, but within 11

377
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:13,320
you can't know you don't know exactly where someone is. I

378
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:15,880
would say you sort of like, basically as a parrot, you kind

379
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:18,360
of like fly around and try to get the sense of where people

380
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:22,120
are. The only other place you know of is because you know that

381
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:24,840
there's an auto repair shop. And that could maybe help you repair

382
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:31,920
the bike. Oh. Did we bring the bike with us? No, it's 10 miles out of town. Let's go back

383
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:36,480
and get the bike. We could send them back to the bike. That's true. We could tell them

384
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:40,480
to go get the bike. Do I have triple A? You do not have triple A. What kind of fucking

385
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:45,000
game is this? You have triple D's. Do I have triple A? I have triple D's? You have three

386
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:49,680
double D tits. Okay, I go to the strip club. Okay, you go to the strip club with your own

387
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:51,680
Yeah, with a resume.

388
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:53,680
Okay. Alright, what does your resume have on it?

389
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:55,680
Dog most of my life.

390
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:57,680
Okay. We're gonna move on from this bit.

391
00:19:57,680 --> 00:19:59,680
What were you saying, Cameron?

392
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:01,680
Nothing interesting.

393
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:03,680
Alright, cool. That's a good start.

394
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:05,680
Um, no, what do you guys want to do? Sorry.

395
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:07,680
Hmm.

396
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:09,680
Is there like a guy delivering

397
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:11,680
something to Duluth today?

398
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:13,680
There's gotta be a train in this god damn town.

399
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:15,680
Yeah, or like a bus. A bus stop, maybe.

400
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:17,680
There is a bus stop, yes.

401
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:19,240
- Oh. - Yes.

402
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:21,000
- I, so you can go to the bus stop

403
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,080
and try to read the schedule.

404
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:22,920
- Yeah. - Yeah, dude.

405
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:24,120
- Yeah, I can read. - Let's do that.

406
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:25,720
- Yeah. - Okay, cool.

407
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:26,920
All of you roll intelligence checks

408
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:28,320
to see if you can read the schedule at the bus stop.

409
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:31,120
If I were the bus stop, it's like pretty abandoned

410
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:31,940
for the most part.

411
00:20:31,940 --> 00:20:33,200
You see like one old guy there

412
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:35,480
just sort of like sitting on the bench.

413
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:37,280
- I got a 10. - Okay.

414
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:38,380
- I got a nine.

415
00:20:38,380 --> 00:20:41,640
- And this is intelligence? - Mm-hmm.

416
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:43,120
- I got a six.

417
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:45,240
- Okay, none of you guys can really read the sign.

418
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:47,400
- Oh. - There is an old guy there.

419
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:55,220
I think it says sub. Maybe he can help you. Yeah I fly over to the old guy and I

420
00:20:55,220 --> 00:21:02,280

I did not say that. We have to kill an old man.

455
00:23:59,100 --> 00:24:03,760
Patches said that. I guess we do have to do that now.

456
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:09,320
I just heard the voice of God and it said to kill an old man. I didn't say that.

457
00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:13,140
I mean I'm gonna trust this parrot because he only speaks English which is something I

458
00:24:13,140 --> 00:24:17,060
very much value. And this old man could be God he's bigger than me. He certainly

459
00:24:17,060 --> 00:24:27,620
we could you could try to kill this man nah we might be worth the smoke this old

from his face flicking it off his fingers and he's like get get with you you're

464
00:24:52,900 --> 00:24:56,580
worse than the man bear pig

465
00:25:01,060 --> 00:25:12,700
okay is it a character like South Park is it talking about South Park do we have

466
00:25:12,700 --> 00:25:20,540
to worry about a man-bear pig now maybe as a little intimidating you're worse

467
00:25:20,540 --> 00:25:26,340
than that damn man-bear pig that's been terrorizing Brooklyn

468
00:25:26,340 --> 00:25:31,020
Oh, it is.

469
00:25:31,020 --> 00:25:32,020
Ferret groans.

470
00:25:32,020 --> 00:25:33,020
Oh.

471
00:25:33,020 --> 00:25:34,900
Well, yeah, but you're still at the bus stop.

472
00:25:34,900 --> 00:25:38,340
You still have time before the bus of Duluth shows up.

473
00:25:38,340 --> 00:25:42,340
Can I roll an investigation to see if I see a man bear pig footprint?

474
00:25:42,340 --> 00:25:44,340
Yeah, sure.

475
00:25:44,340 --> 00:25:45,340
Okay.

476
00:25:45,340 --> 00:25:50,460
You fucked up by saying that shit, Patches.

477
00:25:50,460 --> 00:25:52,580
That was a nine.

478
00:25:52,580 --> 00:25:53,580
Okay.

479
00:25:53,580 --> 00:25:56,580
Yeah, no, there's no man.

480
00:25:56,580 --> 00:25:59,260
Like, as far as you can tell, you can't really see any man bear pig.

481
00:25:59,260 --> 00:26:01,260
I think this guy's got crackers!

482
00:26:01,260 --> 00:26:04,260
That's pretty good.

483
00:26:04,260 --> 00:26:06,260
That's pretty good.

484
00:26:06,260 --> 00:26:08,260
Didn't you guys like that?

485
00:26:08,260 --> 00:26:10,260
Stop talking in front of him!

486
00:26:10,260 --> 00:26:12,260
I wasn't speaking English, I was speaking animal that time.

487
00:26:12,260 --> 00:26:14,260
Yeah, it's animal, I can see. I can tell.

488
00:26:14,260 --> 00:26:16,260
What do we do, man?

489
00:26:16,260 --> 00:26:18,260
Let's go watch a movie.

490
00:26:18,260 --> 00:26:22,260
Clearly there's no such thing as the man bear pig and we won't get attacked by it during the movie.

491
00:26:22,260 --> 00:26:25,220
All right, let's go to the movie can we investigate again?

492
00:26:25,220 --> 00:26:29,780
Okay

493
00:26:29,780 --> 00:26:37,300
I'm gonna investigate the man-bear-pig hub in the middle of the town. That's labeled very clearly with a sign. I can let that

494
00:26:37,300 --> 00:26:44,020
What movie should we see let's see it's 2004. Let's see homeless bound

495
00:26:47,220 --> 00:26:49,580
He's back in theaters for a limited run

496
00:26:49,580 --> 00:26:55,860
Started it. There's a limited run homeward bound playing in the theater in Brooklyn. Maybe we'll get some ideas

497
00:26:55,860 --> 00:26:58,780
Okay. Yeah, you go to the theater

498
00:26:58,780 --> 00:27:01,860
You're at the ticket booth

00:27:01,860 --> 00:27:04,340

Okay.

Uh, eleven.

508
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:29,600
Okay, uh, he's like,

509
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:31,600
"What? No I'm not. This is-

510
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:33,600
That was fucked up.

511
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:35,600
What you did, but I'm not dreaming."

512
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:38,600
Uh...

513
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:40,600
You're dead!

514
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:42,600
Woof woof.

515
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:44,600
Woof woof!

516
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:48,120
I can't allow animals in. I can't lose another job, okay?

517
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:49,120
I fly in.

518
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:51,120
You fly in? Okay, uh...

519
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:53,120
Yeah, you just fly in. I mean, he's behind the booth.

520
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:53,620
Yeah.

521
00:27:53,620 --> 00:27:54,120
You don't need to do anything.

522
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:55,620
Yeah, we don't need tickets.

523
00:27:55,620 --> 00:27:56,120
Yeah.

524
00:27:56,120 --> 00:27:57,620
Fuck you, man.

525
00:27:57,620 --> 00:27:58,620
I just walk in.

526
00:27:58,620 --> 00:27:59,620
Yeah, me too.

527
00:27:59,620 --> 00:28:01,620
[laughter]

528
00:28:01,620 --> 00:28:03,620
Okay, you all walk in.

529
00:28:03,620 --> 00:28:07,620
Did he really think looking at the animals and saying, "I can't let you in" was gonna work?

530
00:28:07,620 --> 00:28:08,620
[laughter]

531
00:28:08,620 --> 00:28:10,620
But I want some concessions.

532
00:28:10,620 --> 00:28:12,620
I get... I swoop down and I...

533
00:28:12,620 --> 00:28:13,620
I want a bunch of crunches.

534
00:28:13,620 --> 00:28:16,820
I swoop down and I pick up a box of Bunch O Crunch for normal dogs.

535
00:28:16,820 --> 00:28:17,940
This is one of the best days ever.

536
00:28:17,940 --> 00:28:19,060
Yeah, I love chocolate.

537
00:28:19,060 --> 00:28:31,060
At this point, there are a couple of employees at the Regal Cinema

538
00:28:31,060 --> 00:28:34,260
who are trying to nab you in a cartoonish way.

539
00:28:34,260 --> 00:28:35,860
Dude, dog nabbers?

540
00:28:35,860 --> 00:28:36,340
Fuck this.

541
00:28:36,340 --> 00:28:37,540
So, I'm gonna...

542
00:28:39,540 --> 00:28:43,940
So one of them sees you going for the Bunch O' Crunch, Pleasant Parrot.

543
00:28:43,940 --> 00:28:46,540
Roll a Dexterity saving throw.

544
00:28:46,540 --> 00:28:49,540
Um, 16.

545
00:28:49,540 --> 00:28:55,420
Yeah, Pimply Teen tries to swipe at you and he's not able to.

546
00:28:55,420 --> 00:29:01,100
You're able to grab the Bunch O' Crunch with your talons and fly, continue to fly away.

547
00:29:01,100 --> 00:29:06,060
Now there is one other guy trying to grab you, the Hungry Hamster.

548
00:29:06,060 --> 00:29:07,060
I'm already somewhere else.

549
00:29:07,060 --> 00:29:09,060
I'm inside the vending machine.

550
00:29:09,060 --> 00:29:11,060
[laughter]

551
00:29:11,060 --> 00:29:14,060
I hopped into the vending machine and I'm trying to climb up.

552
00:29:14,060 --> 00:29:17,060
Are you tra- you're just trapped in the vending machine.

553
00:29:17,060 --> 00:29:20,060
Yeah, I'm trapped in the vending machine. I'm trying to climb up the rings.

554
00:29:20,060 --> 00:29:22,060
So I guess I'll have to roll for accuracy.

555
00:29:22,060 --> 00:29:24,060
Yeah, do it!

556
00:29:24,060 --> 00:29:26,060
You gotta!

557
00:29:26,060 --> 00:29:29,060
That's a 16.

558
00:29:29,060 --> 00:29:31,060
Yeah, you're doing a great job!

559
00:29:31,060 --> 00:29:34,060
You should take some quarters while you're in there.

560
00:29:34,060 --> 00:29:36,060
Do you fuckin' rock those rings?

561
00:29:36,060 --> 00:29:38,460
I ate a whole thing of Famous Amos already.

562
00:29:38,460 --> 00:29:40,460
I mean, you roll a, uh...

563
00:29:40,460 --> 00:29:43,060
Yeah, the entire row, all the way back.

564
00:29:43,060 --> 00:29:45,060
Roll a...

565
00:29:45,060 --> 00:29:48,060
Athletics check.

566
00:29:48,060 --> 00:29:50,060
What'd you get?

567
00:29:50,060 --> 00:29:51,060
I got a one.

568
00:29:51,060 --> 00:29:52,060
No!

569
00:29:52,060 --> 00:29:55,060
A crit one or, like, one minus?

570
00:29:55,060 --> 00:29:56,060
One, the number.

571
00:29:56,060 --> 00:29:59,060
So, is it like a dirty one or, like, oh, you rolled a one.

572
00:29:59,060 --> 00:30:03,060
So, uh, this big guy comes in, one of the bigger employees,

573
00:30:03,060 --> 00:30:06,600
your employees are shaking the vending machine and your your little feet are

574
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:12,680
sticking out of the famous Amos pack and you tumble over and fall down and you

575
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:18,260
take five damage whoa fall into the down and he grabs you and he picks you up and

576
00:30:18,260 --> 00:30:22,300
you're like you're in between his hands he's like look a little fella I can't

577
00:30:22,300 --> 00:30:26,200
let you in here I'm the biggest teen who works at the movie theater he tries to

578
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:29,560
He starts to move you outside of the movie theater.

579
00:30:29,560 --> 00:30:31,080
Nobody hurts my friends!

580
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:33,240
Okay, yeah, what are you gonna do?

581
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:35,200
I'm gonna use Dillifreen.

582
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:38,160
Okay, you're gonna use your eldritch powers?

583
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:39,400
I'm gonna turn evil.

584
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:42,160
Okay, yeah, roll a d20.

585
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:44,880
This is what happens when someone tries to hurt Patrick.

586
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:45,880
That's a six.

587
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:49,840
Okay, and roll another d20.

588
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:50,840
20.

589
00:30:50,840 --> 00:30:51,840
Okay.

590
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:53,840
A natural 20?

591
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:54,840
Yeah.

592
00:30:54,840 --> 00:30:55,840
Okay.

593
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:57,840
(laughter)

594
00:30:57,840 --> 00:30:59,840
This is scary.

595
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:01,840
I'm going to use this at least once an episode.

596
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:03,840
Okay.

597
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:05,840
You have to.

598
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:07,840
You can't give me something like this.

599
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:09,840
Okay, hold on.

600
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:11,840
Hold on.

601
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:13,840
I wasn't sure if something like this would happen to this.

602
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:15,840
Something like this?

603
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:17,840
Do continue.

604
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:19,840
I have to check some stuff first.

605
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:21,840
Sorry.

606
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:23,840
Okay.

607
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:28,240
Okay, roll 2d8.

608
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:32,740
14.

609
00:31:32,740 --> 00:31:38,440
Describe your kill.

610
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:42,640
Oh my god, dude.

611
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:46,620
You, I'll tell you as much and then you can describe the rest

612
00:31:46,620 --> 00:31:47,940
because I do like to do that.

613
00:31:47,940 --> 00:31:50,440
Your eyes roll in the back of your head.

614
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:51,440
Yeah, you hear

615
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:53,440
(gibberish)

616
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:55,440
and um

617
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:57,440
uh, your beak opens wide

618
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:59,440
like shoop de whoop

619
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:01,440
and out comes a beam

620
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:03,440
of ice cold

621
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:05,440
energy that um

622
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:07,440
shoots at the teen

623
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:09,440
it kills him, describe the rest

624
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:11,440
yeah so it freezes him

625
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:13,440
completely solid into a block of ice

626
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:15,440
and then I start flying back and forth

627
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:17,440
you know like a samurai in a movie

628
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:19,440
cutting it and when I'm done

629
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:21,940
it's an ice statue of Frosty the Snowman.

630
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:25,940
Yeah, it's Frosty the Snowman, but you carved it out of this teen.

631
00:32:25,940 --> 00:32:26,440
Yeah.

632
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:29,440
So he- it's just- it's a mess. It's terrifying.

633
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:30,440
Uh-

634
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:31,440
I'm gonna start screaming.

635
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:33,440
Everyone in the- everyone in the movie theater who's-

636
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:34,440
*Screams*

637
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:37,440
is screaming. Uh, fire alarm is pulled.

638
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:37,940
Oh my god!

639
00:32:37,940 --> 00:32:39,440
You're safe now.

640
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:40,440
I was just about to ask.

641
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:47,940
Yeah, yeah, you- yeah, the teen drops you, you land, uh, uh, uh, you- you take one damage, but you're fine.

642
00:32:47,940 --> 00:32:48,940
You're just on the ground now.

643
00:32:48,940 --> 00:32:50,940
I look at Patrick and I say, "I love you!"

644
00:32:50,940 --> 00:32:52,940
"Thank you!"

645
00:32:52,940 --> 00:32:54,940
"I have to go!"

646
00:32:54,940 --> 00:32:56,940
"Oh my god, fuck!"

647
00:32:56,940 --> 00:32:58,940
"Oh my god!"

648
00:32:58,940 --> 00:33:00,940
"Before we go, I bring the popcorn machine with us."

649
00:33:00,940 --> 00:33:02,940
*laughter*

650
00:33:02,940 --> 00:33:04,940
Are you trying to bring a popcorn machine?

651
00:33:04,940 --> 00:33:06,940
Yeah, I put it...

652
00:33:06,940 --> 00:33:08,940
It's one of those

653
00:33:08,940 --> 00:33:10,940
like wheelie ones, and

654
00:33:10,940 --> 00:33:12,940
I've attached it to a leash.

655
00:33:12,940 --> 00:33:14,940
I've tied it to a leash that's attached to Caleb.

656
00:33:14,940 --> 00:33:16,940
Roll a sleight of hand

657
00:33:16,940 --> 00:33:18,700
to see if you could do all that shit.

658
00:33:18,700 --> 00:33:22,020
I got a six.

659
00:33:22,020 --> 00:33:24,420
Okay, you were not able to tie it to the dog.

660
00:33:24,420 --> 00:33:26,300
He tied it around like one of his feet.

661
00:33:26,300 --> 00:33:27,380
Let's just get the fuck out of here.

662
00:33:27,380 --> 00:33:29,740
You tied his feet together by accident.

663
00:33:29,740 --> 00:33:34,860
He's like trying, you're like trying to drag the popcorn machine

664
00:33:34,860 --> 00:33:35,540
without your back legs.

665
00:33:35,540 --> 00:33:40,420
The popcorn machine does fall over and I do eat most of the popcorn.

666
00:33:40,420 --> 00:33:41,820
Yeah, you eat the popcorn.

667
00:33:41,820 --> 00:33:43,580
I'm still counting this as a win.

668
00:33:43,580 --> 00:33:45,980
I'm not going home empty handed.

669
00:33:46,220 --> 00:33:51,920
okay and alright okay and uh... yes you all all are you talking here what you

670
00:33:51,920 --> 00:33:52,620
know me in the fall

671
00:33:52,620 --> 00:33:58,260
uh... running out of the movie theater this team is just a frozen bloody mass

672
00:33:58,260 --> 00:33:59,700
looks like frosty

673
00:33:59,700 --> 00:34:03,020
uh... uh... you're running out of the movie theater

674
00:34:03,020 --> 00:34:07,900
uh... uh... you know

675
00:34:07,900 --> 00:34:11,820

676
00:34:11,820 --> 00:34:13,140
and uh...

677
00:34:13,140 --> 00:34:16,580
uh... and uh... you hear that so what do you want to

678
00:34:16,580 --> 00:34:20,120

679
00:34:20,120 --> 00:34:24,900
about this and if we have no it's not only did you know i don't believe

680
00:34:24,900 --> 00:34:26,300
apparently this

681
00:34:26,300 --> 00:34:27,960
what

682
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:32,540
that's a good point and i think that what we've got to do

683
00:34:32,540 --> 00:34:37,320
let's just go to the best off of what you have a plan

684
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:39,320
Just go to the back of the place.

685
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:40,320
No, we can...

686
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:42,320
I wanted to watch the movie!

687
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:44,320
I got a great idea!

688
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:49,320
Let's open the fire exit and go watch the rest of a movie.

689
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:51,320
Okay, yeah, let's just do that.

690
00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:52,320
Yeah!

691
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:54,320
Okay, um...

692
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:56,320
You're gonna go to the fire exit,

693
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:58,320
which is in the back of the theater.

694
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:01,320
Check your inventory for fake mustaches.

695
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:06,320
I got a seven.

696
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:08,880
Okay, let me check your inventory.

697
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:13,320
I bet this item helps us loads.

698
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:15,000
Machine gun.

699
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:20,160

00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:22,160
Sorry, hold on.

701
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:24,160

And they're like, "Freeze! Freeze, hungry hamster and friends!

731

We don't know what happened exactly, but we're very suspicious of it.

Of what could have happened here." What if the jail is in Duluth?

00:39:28,120 --> 00:39:32,080
This is going to be great for their PR. Yeah. They're like, Oh no,

793
00:39:32,080 --> 00:39:34,240
I thought we were only supposed to do this around black children.

794
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:38,560
And they started doing little dances. Um, and where are the cameras?

They're gonna do this for a minute. Oh my god. That's enough for us to get back in the movie theater.

797
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:52,040
Let's get away, yeah. Let's watch 30 seconds of the movie and then spend 30

and you run out of the movie theater people are terrified of the parrot and

803
00:40:17,360 --> 00:40:22,160
you go into hiding all of you roll a stealth check with advantage to hide

812
00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:17,520
Okay, and yourself?

813
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:19,120
- I just go back into the vending machine.

814
00:41:19,120 --> 00:41:20,640
(laughing)

815
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:21,480
They can't find me in there.

816
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:23,480
- You're where the famous Amos was.

817
00:41:23,480 --> 00:41:25,520
- I'll just eat snacks instead of them.

818
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:28,360
- He's doing the same gag at me, but with famous Amos.

819
00:41:28,360 --> 00:41:30,200
(laughing)

820
00:41:30,200 --> 00:41:32,720
- Yeah, you're all hidden, by the way.

821
00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:33,960
They couldn't find you.

822
00:41:33,960 --> 00:41:36,400
The cops look for like three or four minutes

823
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:40,720
before they're like, "Let's go get donuts," and they leave.

824
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:42,160
So you're all hidden.

825
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:45,640
but keep in mind any obviously if you go anywhere

826
00:41:45,640 --> 00:41:48,200
people are are are looking for you

827
00:41:48,200 --> 00:41:53,040
you did you look at the movies you did kill a boy well i didn't kill a boy

828
00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:53,800
right

829
00:41:53,800 --> 00:41:56,080
you know it was patrick's for you

830
00:41:56,080 --> 00:42:00,380
it's my fault was that the fall for getting picked up by a boy

831
00:42:00,380 --> 00:42:02,240
i was just trying to save him from my fault

832
00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:05,160
so i feel like we could get into some standard ground law here

833
00:42:05,160 --> 00:42:07,520
it i think i did and i'm up

834
00:42:07,520 --> 00:42:11,200
it's a listen it's not going to wait a little bit it's brooklyn law

835
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:14,360
that if you're if you're a homies getting getting moved on

836
00:42:14,360 --> 00:42:17,360
you can turn bad you cannot argue that you can bus back yet

837
00:42:17,360 --> 00:42:19,840
and if the regulate exactly

838
00:42:19,840 --> 00:42:20,760
the

839
00:42:20,760 --> 00:42:24,240
to regulate that's that is the brooklyn law yeah right through

840
00:42:24,240 --> 00:42:26,600
the plan a west coast song nothing yeah

841
00:42:26,600 --> 00:42:28,840
makes no sense

842
00:42:28,840 --> 00:42:32,520
uh... yes a year you're all where you said you you were

843
00:42:32,520 --> 00:42:33,720
yes it works

844
00:42:33,720 --> 00:42:36,120
support down posturing

845
00:42:36,120 --> 00:42:40,100
and back in the pending machine couldn't get can hold myself

846
00:42:40,100 --> 00:42:45,620
hold myself back so he's too hungry I mean a couple of things obviously you can

847
00:42:45,620 --> 00:42:48,380
wait till the theater closes it's probably gonna close down for the day

848
00:42:48,380 --> 00:42:55,180
pretty soon dead child in it he's not a child you said he was a teenager it's

849
00:42:55,180 --> 00:42:58,620
something you're right sorry the Parkland children if they those got

850
00:42:58,620 --> 00:43:05,120
killed that'd be worse but uh yeah I mean like and eventually the you know you'll

851
00:43:05,120 --> 00:43:09,540
be able to move eventually so like there's some time you can wait until

852
00:43:09,540 --> 00:43:13,340
things are sort of calm down these are kind of closed down if you looked at the

853
00:43:13,340 --> 00:43:20,420
bird news you would see news about some sort of mysterious murder bird and it's

854
00:43:20,420 --> 00:43:24,660
sort of nighttime people don't know where you are it's over the place is

855
00:43:24,660 --> 00:43:27,600
closed you're the only one in the vending machine you're the only one by

00:43:27,600 --> 00:43:30,460
the poster you've been holding that pose for a while yeah I've kind of been doing

857
00:43:30,460 --> 00:43:35,100
like scooby-doo painting eyes though back and forth I made friends with the rat

858
00:43:35,100 --> 00:43:36,100
You make friends with a rat.

859
00:43:36,100 --> 00:43:37,100
You make friends with a rat.

860
00:43:37,100 --> 00:43:38,100
"Hey, how's it going?"

861
00:43:38,100 --> 00:43:39,100
"Cool."

862
00:43:39,100 --> 00:43:40,100
"I'm a rat.

864
00:43:41,100 --> 00:43:42,100
"Nice."

865
00:43:42,100 --> 00:43:43,100
"I always sound like this.

866
00:43:43,100 --> 00:43:46,100
In everything, rats always sound like this."

867
00:43:46,100 --> 00:43:48,100
There's never any...

868
00:43:48,100 --> 00:43:51,740
Yeah, okay, you make friends with a rat.

869
00:43:51,740 --> 00:43:52,740
His name is Charlemagne.

870
00:43:52,740 --> 00:43:55,740
Yeah, so now what do you guys want to do?

871
00:43:55,740 --> 00:43:58,100
You can all meet up, maybe above the sewer grate.

872
00:43:58,100 --> 00:43:59,100
First thing...

873
00:43:59,100 --> 00:44:00,100
Right now you're safe.

874
00:44:00,100 --> 00:44:02,220
I clear out that god damn vending machine.

875
00:44:02,220 --> 00:44:03,220
You take it to the tent.

876
00:44:03,220 --> 00:44:04,220

879
00:44:18,540 --> 00:44:23,420
Okay good. Then. Well you eat the candy too, the straight candy that's down the bottom too. Yeah I get the candy too.

Like Reese's too. Yeah I get all that and then the one above it is always the premium chips. Yes.

881
00:44:30,060 --> 00:44:32,860
So like the Gardetto's and stuff, I get those out of the way.

882
00:44:32,860 --> 00:44:36,140
Yeah, what are those called where they're like, they're like different colors?

Yeah, I just clear it out and then I go about my business.

888
00:44:48,620 --> 00:44:51,820
You commit theft. Yeah, you eat the entire vending machine.

889
00:44:51,820 --> 00:44:52,220
Yeah.

890
00:44:52,220 --> 00:44:53,660
It's not theft if you're hungry.

891
00:44:53,660 --> 00:44:54,220
Yeah.

892
00:44:54,220 --> 00:44:57,500
It's not theft, honestly, you know, a lot of people would agree.

893
00:44:58,620 --> 00:45:00,920
And so you're, yeah, you guys are here.

894
00:45:00,920 --> 00:45:02,580
Your stomach looks crazy.

895
00:45:02,580 --> 00:45:03,420
- Mm-hmm.

896
00:45:03,420 --> 00:45:04,860
- You two are there.

897
00:45:04,860 --> 00:45:06,700
Your face is kind of permanently frozen

898
00:45:06,700 --> 00:45:07,540
and sort of a dog smile.

899
00:45:07,540 --> 00:45:09,700
- I just kind of look more like the Homeward Bound dog now.

900
00:45:09,700 --> 00:45:12,780
- Yeah, you look more like a shadow.

901
00:45:12,780 --> 00:45:15,420
And you smell a little bit.

902
00:45:15,420 --> 00:45:16,260
- Nice!

903
00:45:16,260 --> 00:45:17,100
- Yeah.

904
00:45:17,100 --> 00:45:17,920
- That's not good.

905
00:45:17,920 --> 00:45:18,760
- So what's up?

906
00:45:18,760 --> 00:45:19,580
- I love this!

907
00:45:19,580 --> 00:45:21,820
- The bus is gonna come probably in like another

908
00:45:21,820 --> 00:45:23,420
four or five hours, so if you--

909
00:45:23,420 --> 00:45:25,180
- We should sleep a couple hours, right?

910
00:45:25,180 --> 00:45:26,820
We're tired.

911
00:45:26,820 --> 00:45:30,020
We only need to sleep for exactly three hours.

912
00:45:30,020 --> 00:45:32,020
Because we're animals.

913
00:45:32,020 --> 00:45:33,020
Is that true?

914
00:45:33,020 --> 00:45:35,020
My dogs only sleep three hours.

915
00:45:35,020 --> 00:45:37,020
Your dogs sleep three- how do you know-

916
00:45:37,020 --> 00:45:39,020
Nevermind.

917
00:45:39,020 --> 00:45:41,020
I don't want to get into this right now.

918
00:45:41,020 --> 00:45:43,020
Your dogs sleep-

919
00:45:43,020 --> 00:45:45,020
Dude, my dogs do not sleep three hours.

920
00:45:45,020 --> 00:45:47,020
Dogs sleep for a long time.

921
00:45:47,020 --> 00:45:49,020
They sleep like during the day.

922
00:45:49,020 --> 00:45:51,020
Cats just take naps.

923
00:45:51,020 --> 00:45:53,020
Are you just saying facts now?

924
00:45:53,020 --> 00:45:55,020
You just said like all animals.

925
00:45:55,020 --> 00:46:03,660
just said like animals sleep three hours most animals do okay we just go to sleep

926
00:46:03,660 --> 00:46:09,620

00:46:23,260 --> 00:46:25,260
You go to sleep in the little bed

931
00:46:25,260 --> 00:46:30,280
And yeah, the bus is gonna be here in a little bit. So you guys can go hop on that bus if you want to

I would love you to succeed at this.

937
00:46:57,420 --> 00:47:01,020
Okay, so it just might look fucked up.

938
00:47:01,020 --> 00:47:04,580
And then a... where's my fucking intelligence?

939
00:47:04,580 --> 00:47:08,180
And then an 11 intelligence. It's like pretty gross,

941
00:47:11,700 --> 00:47:15,460
Yeah, I don't give a fuck. I should get an award for this.

942
00:47:15,460 --> 00:47:18,540
I just baked something.

943
00:47:18,540 --> 00:47:19,540
Yeah.

944
00:47:19,540 --> 00:47:20,540
Nobody recorded it.

945
00:47:20,540 --> 00:47:25,140
It's like somebody who's like, "Oh, if you put a little salt in it, it tastes better,

946
00:47:25,140 --> 00:47:26,980
but you put too much salt in it."

947
00:47:26,980 --> 00:47:28,540
People, I'll eat it.

948
00:47:28,540 --> 00:47:31,540
Yeah, dogs literally lick their own fucking assholes.

949
00:47:31,540 --> 00:47:34,300
This is the only thing I've eaten besides asshole this entire game.

950
00:47:34,300 --> 00:47:37,140
I eat all the spiders out of the back room.

951
00:47:37,140 --> 00:47:38,940
Yeah, there were a lot.

952
00:47:38,940 --> 00:47:40,980
I ate the cage I was sleeping in.

953
00:47:40,980 --> 00:47:45,140
I wasn't even conscious when I did it.

954
00:47:45,140 --> 00:47:47,540
Your body looks so crazy now.

955
00:47:47,540 --> 00:47:49,540
I did it in my sleep.

956
00:47:49,540 --> 00:47:51,540
Do we get to restore our hit points?

957
00:47:51,540 --> 00:47:53,540
Yeah, everything is restored.

958
00:47:53,540 --> 00:47:55,540
It was really a short rest, if it was only three hours.

959
00:47:55,540 --> 00:47:57,540
But it's dog years.

960
00:47:57,540 --> 00:47:59,540
It was really a long rest.

961
00:47:59,540 --> 00:48:01,540
So let's restore it back.

962
00:48:01,540 --> 00:48:03,540
Okay.

963
00:48:03,540 --> 00:48:05,540

You are you died because he died because he didn't have enough bread. Yeah

981
00:49:39,600 --> 00:49:46,080
You see he gets on the bus he's strapped up and ready to take down

982
00:49:46,080 --> 00:49:49,620
You know another gang. Yeah

983
00:49:49,620 --> 00:49:56,160
But he feels around his pockets for bread and he's like, oh god, I have to see my daughter

984
00:49:56,160 --> 00:49:59,920
Yeah

985
00:49:59,920 --> 00:50:05,440
sugar got too low and he didn't pump his insulin. So now we're back in the real world.

986
00:50:05,440 --> 00:50:12,640
In the real world, Eddie. In Chicago. Yeah, back in the real world of Brooklyn, Wisconsin. And

987
00:50:12,640 --> 00:50:19,920
you're all waiting for the bus and the bus shows up and the bus door opens and the bus driver is

988
00:50:19,920 --> 00:50:25,600
sort of like, "Huh?" Like, you know, it's three animals there. Yeah. You guys walk on the bus.

989
00:50:25,600 --> 00:50:27,600
I got an idea.

990
00:50:27,600 --> 00:50:29,600
Say sir, we're service animals.

991
00:50:29,600 --> 00:50:31,600
I think he's just gonna let us on the bus.

992
00:50:31,600 --> 00:50:33,600
Nevermind.

993
00:50:33,600 --> 00:50:35,600
He lets you on the bus. He's super chill.

994
00:50:35,600 --> 00:50:37,600
Uh, well, yeah, he lets you on the bus.

995
00:50:37,600 --> 00:50:39,600
I can't back away from that now.

996
00:50:39,600 --> 00:50:41,600
He lets you on the bus,

997
00:50:41,600 --> 00:50:43,600
you sit on the bus,

998
00:50:43,600 --> 00:50:45,600
the dog sits on the bus straight up,

999
00:50:45,600 --> 00:50:47,600
three of you sitting on the bus,

1000
00:50:47,600 --> 00:50:49,600
you guys sort of look at the

1001
00:50:49,600 --> 00:50:51,600
signs up top, looking for Duluth,

1002
00:50:51,600 --> 00:50:53,600
roll an intelligence check, Cam.

1003
00:50:53,600 --> 00:50:54,600
Oh no.

1004
00:50:54,600 --> 00:50:55,600
How'd you do?

1005
00:50:55,600 --> 00:50:56,600
That's a 2 plus 3.

1006
00:50:56,600 --> 00:50:57,600
That's a 5.

1007
00:50:57,600 --> 00:50:58,600
You're having a real hard time telling where Duluth is and where it isn't.

1008
00:50:58,600 --> 00:50:59,600
I think we're on the moon!

1009
00:50:59,600 --> 00:51:00,600
You see people starting to get off of the bus, yada yada.

1010
00:51:00,600 --> 00:51:01,600
And then all of a sudden the bus stops for, like it doesn't look like it had a stop.

1011
00:51:01,600 --> 00:51:02,600
You sort of pattern recognition, this doesn't look like the places the buses usually stop

1012
00:51:02,600 --> 00:51:03,600
at.

1013
00:51:03,600 --> 00:51:04,600
And then you see people starting to get off of the bus, yada yada.

1014
00:51:04,600 --> 00:51:05,600
And then all of a sudden the bus stops for, like it doesn't look like it had a stop.

1015
00:51:05,600 --> 00:51:06,600
You sort of pattern recognition, this doesn't look like the places the buses usually stop

1016
00:51:06,600 --> 00:51:07,600
at.

1017
00:51:07,600 --> 00:51:08,600
And then you see people starting to get off of the bus, yada yada.

1018
00:51:08,600 --> 00:51:12,400
You see people starting to get off of the bus, yada yada.

1019
00:51:12,400 --> 00:51:18,360
And then all of a sudden the bus stops for, like it doesn't look like it had a stop.

1020
00:51:18,360 --> 00:51:22,440
You sort of, pattern recognition, this doesn't look like the places the buses usually stop

1021
00:51:22,440 --> 00:51:23,440
at.

1022
00:51:23,440 --> 00:51:30,080
You see the bus driver get out of the bus, he's out of the bus, he's out of the bus for

1023
00:51:30,080 --> 00:51:32,040
a little while, for a little while longer.

1024
00:51:32,040 --> 00:51:33,040
Can we see him?

1025
00:51:33,040 --> 00:51:34,040
Through the window?

1026
00:51:34,040 --> 00:51:35,040
You can no longer see him.

1027
00:51:35,040 --> 00:51:36,040
Uh oh.

1028
00:51:36,040 --> 00:51:37,040
Oh no.

1029
00:51:37,040 --> 00:51:38,040

1030
00:51:38,040 --> 00:51:57,520

1033
00:52:06,960 --> 00:52:11,240
this thing it can't just be you you need somebody else to do one of the other

00:52:24,720 --> 00:52:25,720
Fine, I'll be the eyes.

1038
00:52:25,720 --> 00:52:26,720
What?

1039
00:52:26,720 --> 00:52:27,720
No.

1040
00:52:27,720 --> 00:52:28,720
No.

1041
00:52:28,720 --> 00:52:29,720
No.

1042
00:52:29,720 --> 00:52:30,720
I didn't know.

1043
00:52:30,720 --> 00:52:31,720
I'll be the feet.

1044
00:52:31,720 --> 00:52:32,720
I'll be the fucking feet.

1045
00:52:32,720 --> 00:52:33,720
You can't reach to the be the eyes.

1046
00:52:33,720 --> 00:52:35,720
I can, I'm really long.

1047
00:52:35,720 --> 00:52:36,720
No.

1048
00:52:36,720 --> 00:52:38,720
Yeah, I'm one of those running dogs.

1049
00:52:38,720 --> 00:52:39,720
No.

1050
00:52:39,720 --> 00:52:40,720
No?

1051
00:52:40,720 --> 00:52:41,720
You say you're a Labrador.

1052
00:52:41,720 --> 00:52:42,720
Can one of you just be the feet?

1053
00:52:42,720 --> 00:52:43,720
Isn't that the same thing?

1054
00:52:43,720 --> 00:52:44,720
Is that a running dog?

1055
00:52:44,720 --> 00:52:49,720
I'm looking out of the front of the bus and I say, "Look guys, we're in Duluth!"

1056
00:52:49,720 --> 00:52:52,440
I'm the eyes!

1057
00:52:52,440 --> 00:52:59,320
I pedal to the metal then if I'm the feet I'm having fun. Okay, and you're steering. Yep. So you're giving him directions

1058
00:52:59,320 --> 00:53:01,920
That's the plan. We're about 90 miles an hour in this

1059
00:53:01,920 --> 00:53:04,480
There are other passengers

1060
00:53:04,480 --> 00:53:12,920
They are their typical bus patrons, they're just sort of like whatever

1061
00:53:17,560 --> 00:53:23,920
the Chinatown bus stopping at Burger King. Like, whatever. Yeah, like, until the third

1062
00:53:23,920 --> 00:53:33,040
strange thing happens, I'm okay with whatever's going on. And you start driving a little bit,

1063
00:53:33,040 --> 00:53:42,040
you feel yourself go over something and you go a little bit more. We hit the bus driver?

1064
00:53:42,040 --> 00:53:44,040
I didn't say that.

1065
00:53:44,040 --> 00:53:46,040
Can I see what we went over?

1066
00:53:46,040 --> 00:53:48,040
Roll perception.

1067
00:53:48,040 --> 00:53:50,040
Roll perception.

1068
00:53:50,040 --> 00:53:52,040
Sorry.

1069
00:53:52,040 --> 00:53:54,040
Uh... 18.

1070
00:53:54,040 --> 00:53:56,040
Is it the bus driver?

1071
00:53:56,040 --> 00:53:58,040
It looks an awful lot like the bus driver.

1072
00:53:58,040 --> 00:54:02,040
What was he stopped at?

1073
00:54:02,040 --> 00:54:04,040
You can't tell what he was stopped at yet.

1074
00:54:04,040 --> 00:54:06,040
He's helping an old lady cross the road.

1075
00:54:06,040 --> 00:54:10,040
And all of you now roll perception.

1076
00:54:10,040 --> 00:54:26,480
another 18 for mm-hmm - I got - you're literally just like you're like straight

1077
00:54:26,480 --> 00:54:33,480
being a dog complete dog. I guess it would make sense. He's the eyes. He got an 18.

1078
00:54:33,480 --> 00:54:43,220
Yeah, he got an 18. That's right. You pick up a sound of like something rattling from below.

1079
00:54:43,220 --> 00:54:50,320
You can't quite tell what though. Hmm. I think it's a rattle. Come on, you got an 18.

1080
00:54:50,320 --> 00:54:53,400
I don't know if that's how he told me.

1081
00:54:53,400 --> 00:54:54,400
There's a rattle!

1082
00:54:54,400 --> 00:54:57,720
I think it's a rattlesnake.

1083
00:54:57,720 --> 00:54:58,720
That's better.

1084
00:54:58,720 --> 00:55:01,840
I trust that more we can at least talk to him.

1085
00:55:01,840 --> 00:55:04,880
Sorry, no, that'll be for next session.

1086
00:55:04,880 --> 00:55:06,240
Oh no.

1087
00:55:06,240 --> 00:55:07,240
Keep going.

1088
00:55:07,240 --> 00:55:08,240
What do you do?

1089
00:55:08,240 --> 00:55:12,520
Well, you gotta do something about this rattle.

1090
00:55:12,520 --> 00:55:13,520
You told me about the rattle?

1091
00:55:13,520 --> 00:55:14,520
Yeah.

1092
00:55:14,520 --> 00:55:16,520
I slam on the brakes.

1093
00:55:16,520 --> 00:55:17,520
Fuck yeah.

1094
00:55:17,520 --> 00:55:18,520
Okay, yeah.

1095
00:55:18,520 --> 00:55:19,900
You slam on the brakes.

1096
00:55:19,900 --> 00:55:25,740
You all hear like a *fwoosh* *fwoosh* and like you see rolling out of the front, very

1097
00:55:25,740 --> 00:55:31,100
good move dawg, a terrifying thing.

1098
00:55:31,100 --> 00:55:34,940
Part man, part bear, no!

1099
00:55:34,940 --> 00:55:35,940
No!

1100
00:55:35,940 --> 00:55:36,940
No!

1101
00:55:36,940 --> 00:55:39,900
Part mother fucking pig.

1102
00:55:39,900 --> 00:55:41,860
Oh my god.

1103
00:55:41,860 --> 00:55:43,380
It's like from South Park.

1104
00:55:43,380 --> 00:55:44,380
Oh.

1105
00:55:44,380 --> 00:55:45,380
Jesus Christ.

1106
00:55:45,380 --> 00:55:46,380
It's even scarier.

1107
00:55:46,380 --> 00:55:49,660
What if it says something irreverent?

1108
00:55:49,660 --> 00:55:50,660
What if it's weird?

1109
00:55:50,660 --> 00:55:57,780
Yeah, so ManBearPig rolls out from underneath the bus or something that's part man, part

1110
00:55:57,780 --> 00:55:58,780
bear, part pig.

1111
00:55:58,780 --> 00:56:06,060
And you see it, it took some damage from that because you guys smartly knew to brake when

1112
00:56:06,060 --> 00:56:08,620
you heard him underneath the bus.

1113
00:56:08,620 --> 00:56:12,220
and you see it start to get up and it's like

1114
00:56:12,220 --> 00:56:18,540
and it's sort of standing its ground in front of the bus

1115
00:56:18,540 --> 00:56:23,580
here's a quick question about man bear pig can we talk to him because he's part man

1116
00:56:23,580 --> 00:56:26,620
but he's also bear and pig he's more human than he's more

1117
00:56:26,620 --> 00:56:30,700
but we're we're animals yeah yeah you absolutely could

1118
00:56:30,700 --> 00:56:36,620
okay okay hey i love you i love you too so you're in the bus so he's

1119
00:56:36,620 --> 00:56:48,500
is

1120
00:56:48,500 --> 00:56:50,500
Really loud hamster noise.

1121
00:56:50,500 --> 00:56:52,500
Yeah, wait, hold on. This is what the passenger is hearing.

1122
00:56:52,500 --> 00:56:54,500
Over the loud speaker.

1123
00:56:54,500 --> 00:56:56,500
*Hamster noises*

1124
00:56:56,500 --> 00:56:58,500
You think that's what a hamster sounds like?

1125
00:56:58,500 --> 00:57:00,500
*Laughter*

1126
00:57:00,500 --> 00:57:02,500
Like really small guys in movies?

1127
00:57:02,500 --> 00:57:04,500
Sounds like 645AR.

1128
00:57:04,500 --> 00:57:08,500
Yeah, I got bit by the same thing that bit 645AR.

1129
00:57:08,500 --> 00:57:11,500
So you say, would you say "Hey, what's up?"

1130
00:57:11,500 --> 00:57:13,500
Yeah.

1131
00:57:13,500 --> 00:57:15,500
Hey, we don't know that he's bad.

1132
00:57:15,500 --> 00:57:17,500
He's covered in blood.

1133
00:57:17,500 --> 00:57:19,500
Yeah, he says kill.

1134
00:57:19,500 --> 00:57:21,600
Kill who?

1135
00:57:21,600 --> 00:57:22,800
Kill who?

1136
00:57:22,800 --> 00:57:24,700
Kill.

1137
00:57:24,700 --> 00:57:27,200
No, he thinks for a second.

1138
00:57:27,200 --> 00:57:28,700
Kill.

1139
00:57:28,700 --> 00:57:31,700
Every kill.

1140
00:57:31,700 --> 00:57:37,300
He's never been asked kill who before.

1141
00:57:37,300 --> 00:57:39,100
Okay, just kill people.

1142
00:57:39,100 --> 00:57:42,200
There are some there's a lot of people in that city.

1143
00:57:42,200 --> 00:57:44,300
Yeah, you want to go kill those people.

1144
00:57:44,300 --> 00:57:45,600
Go pass the bus.

1145
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:48,000
Roll, roll, uh, persuasion.

1146
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:50,000
Okay. Who?

1147
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:52,000
All of us or just Cameron?

1148
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:54,000
Oh, um, I guess just the hungry hamster

1149
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:56,000
'cause he's the one on the megaphone.

1150
00:57:56,000 --> 00:58:00,000
Ooh! 22!

1151
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:02,000
Okay, yeah.

1152
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:04,000
[laughter]

1153
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:14,000
Alright, Pat, just what do you got?

1154
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:16,000
*laughter*

1155
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:18,000
fuck off, ok

1156
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:20,000
oh man

1157
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:22,000
*laughter*

1158
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:24,000
*laughter*

1159
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:26,000
fucking hate, hate games

1160
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:28,000
*laughter*

1161
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:30,000
*laughter*

1162
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:32,000
uh, you see the mad bear pig

1163
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:34,000
um

1164
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:36,000
think for a second, kind of an "oh bother"

1165
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:38,000
type of stance

1166
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:40,000
um

1167
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:42,000
that's the bear part

1168
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:43,000
on it.

1169
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:44,000
Hmm.

1170
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:48,000
Maybe just kill people?

1171
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:50,000
Yeah, do that!

1172
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:52,000
Do only that!

1173
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:58,000
And he starts to wander off towards you guys.

1174
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:02,000
And, hold on.

1175
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:04,000
I can't believe how good Pat's roles have been in this campaign.

1176
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:05,000
I know.

1177
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:10,000
He literally doesn't notice any of the people in the bus.

1178
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:17,000
us

1179
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:23,840
we killed all the people in brooklyn milwaukee

1180
00:59:23,840 --> 00:59:28,320
it's a neighborhood in milwaukee

1181
00:59:28,320 --> 00:59:29,800
did we defeat him?

1182
00:59:29,800 --> 00:59:31,440
exactly we did

1183
00:59:31,440 --> 00:59:32,880
try to find people

1184
00:59:32,880 --> 00:59:35,600
so we got experience points for that

1185
00:59:35,600 --> 00:59:40,040
uh... yeah i guess so experience points and so we get out of the lake have a

1186
00:59:40,040 --> 00:59:42,560
hundred experience points yeah man

1187
00:59:42,560 --> 00:59:43,920
connect you hundred

1188
00:59:43,920 --> 00:59:45,640
i guess three hundred

1189
00:59:45,640 --> 00:59:46,800
so that it was the work

1190
00:59:46,800 --> 00:59:48,760
you need to do a lot of the work there

1191
00:59:48,760 --> 00:59:50,080
yeah uh...

1192
00:59:50,080 --> 00:59:52,400
yeah and so it

1193
00:59:52,400 --> 00:59:55,120
yet member pics behind me like i can't

1194
00:59:55,120 --> 00:59:59,120
i can't as a d_n_a_ set the rules are really can't

1195
00:59:59,120 --> 01:00:03,720
but it would be a lot right well you tell that

1196
01:00:03,720 --> 01:00:04,960
see a buddy

1197
01:00:04,960 --> 01:00:08,860
yet so i mean that doesn't mean you won't come back but it certainly means

1198
01:00:08,860 --> 01:00:13,040
that the for now he's just looking for people in brooklyn wisconsin

1199
01:00:13,040 --> 01:00:17,640
uh... carried peace to hit a check for it he had a chance to notice people he

1200
01:00:17,640 --> 01:00:19,340
literally got a one

1201
01:00:19,340 --> 01:00:20,960
so he i can't

1202
01:00:20,960 --> 01:00:25,120
reasonably like say yes i miss you walk by the bus like i can't

1203
01:00:25,120 --> 01:00:26,700
uh... so

1204
01:00:26,700 --> 01:00:28,340
you guys can keep driving

1205
01:00:28,340 --> 01:00:30,840
uh... my god there's another man bear

1206
01:00:30,840 --> 01:00:35,660
I I accidentally put the car in reverse and I just keep following

1207
01:00:35,660 --> 01:00:47,480
Yeah, you certainly can I was a Brooklyn I was really about these people yeah, I don't care about Brooklyn's keep going forward

1208
01:00:47,480 --> 01:00:49,820
All right. Yeah, okay. Yeah, so you guys keep going forward?

1209
01:00:49,820 --> 01:00:54,240
You keep driving. So what we need to do now since you guys don't really know

1210
01:00:54,240 --> 01:00:56,640
So where you're going?

1211
01:00:56,640 --> 01:00:58,640
I'm gonna have you

1212
01:00:59,560 --> 01:01:03,320
Camera since you are still the one who's like navigating the bus. Yeah

1213
01:01:03,320 --> 01:01:06,560
roll a

1214
01:01:06,560 --> 01:01:10,880
Yeah, roll straight intelligence check again to see all right you can um

1215
01:01:10,880 --> 01:01:15,300
I'm the smart one tell where Duluth is cuz you just sort of reset. That's a 13

1216
01:01:15,300 --> 01:01:20,440
Yeah, I mean the thing that's tough is that you are a bird I said the DC for this pretty high

1217
01:01:20,440 --> 01:01:26,880
You could have you definitely had a chance of getting it, but you don't know where to lose your you don't know how to see

1218
01:01:26,880 --> 01:01:28,160
lines

1219
01:01:28,160 --> 01:01:46,080
on

1220
01:01:46,080 --> 01:02:01,080
you

1221
01:02:01,080 --> 01:02:04,080
'cause you're the third one do not continue to ruin my night.

1222
01:02:04,080 --> 01:02:08,080
I have negative one intelligence just do it again.

1223
01:02:08,080 --> 01:02:10,880
Can we add those scores up?

1224
01:02:10,880 --> 01:02:15,580
Yeah, you can add them up and then divide them by three.

1225
01:02:15,580 --> 01:02:17,480
Can I make up a score?

1226
01:02:17,480 --> 01:02:19,580
Okay, that's would be less than 17.

1227
01:02:19,580 --> 01:02:22,680
But so yeah, you you keep trying.

1228
01:02:22,680 --> 01:02:24,680
You can't you keep driving.

1229
01:02:24,680 --> 01:02:30,280
It's kind of hard to find a loose the people on the bus start to kind of notice that like

1230
01:02:30,280 --> 01:02:34,280
You're not stopping because you don't really know what buses are.

1231
01:02:34,280 --> 01:02:41,880
You're not really stopping for anything and eventually the bus just literally runs out of gas.

1232
01:02:41,880 --> 01:02:46,680
You just drove and drove and drove for hours until nightfall.

1233
01:02:46,680 --> 01:02:52,480
There wasn't any gas left in the bus.

1234
01:02:52,480 --> 01:02:55,080
You see all the people just get up and go...

1235
01:02:55,080 --> 01:03:02,100
And they just like get up and just all file out of the bus and just go their separate ways, but you are now

1236
01:03:02,100 --> 01:03:04,960
at

1237
01:03:04,960 --> 01:03:06,960
this bridge here

1238
01:03:06,960 --> 01:03:08,400
so

1239
01:03:08,400 --> 01:03:11,600
Did anyone who got off the bus call an uber? Oh?

1240
01:03:11,600 --> 01:03:14,920
Good question

1241
01:03:14,920 --> 01:03:21,280
Yes, one guy did can we get in the uber with him you can try for sure okay? Can we convince him?

1242
01:03:21,280 --> 01:03:23,760
Yeah, so there's this guy there

1243
01:03:24,960 --> 01:03:30,800
the

1244
01:03:30,800 --> 01:03:33,200
the

1245
01:03:33,200 --> 01:03:35,400
the

1246
01:03:35,400 --> 01:03:37,640
the

1247
01:03:37,640 --> 01:03:39,940
the

1248
01:03:39,940 --> 01:03:42,080
the

1249
01:03:42,080 --> 01:03:44,320
the

1250
01:03:44,320 --> 01:03:46,520
the

1251
01:03:46,520 --> 01:03:48,720
the

1252
01:03:48,720 --> 01:03:50,920
the

1253
01:03:50,920 --> 01:03:53,020
the

1254
01:03:53,020 --> 01:03:54,020
Okay, go for it.

1255
01:03:54,020 --> 01:03:59,020
Okay, so I roll a d20.

1256
01:03:59,020 --> 01:04:03,020
Oh yeah, you're, oh yeah shit, because now it's not.

1257
01:04:03,020 --> 01:04:06,020
And then a dc12, I don't know what that is.

1258
01:04:06,020 --> 01:04:11,020
Oh, that's more for me, so I have to roll against that.

1259
01:04:11,020 --> 01:04:12,020
I rolled a six.

1260
01:04:12,020 --> 01:04:13,020
Oh great.

1261
01:04:13,020 --> 01:04:14,020
You don't have to worry about that.

1262
01:04:14,020 --> 01:04:15,020
Fuck me.

1263
01:04:15,020 --> 01:04:16,020
Don't worry, don't worry, don't worry.

1264
01:04:16,020 --> 01:04:17,020
I'm worrying.

1265
01:04:17,020 --> 01:04:22,020
Okay, yeah, you just roll a d20, add your charisma, or it's dc12, whatever's higher.

1266
01:04:22,020 --> 01:04:26,640
higher so in your case DC 12 is higher so I'm gonna roll against that Dick Van Dyke's

1267
01:04:26,640 --> 01:04:31,460
charisma probably a bad choice for you guys because he's pretty good charisma.

1268
01:04:31,460 --> 01:04:32,460
That's true.

1269
01:04:32,460 --> 01:04:33,460
Yeah.

1270
01:04:33,460 --> 01:04:34,460
One of the most charismatic men alive.

1271
01:04:34,460 --> 01:04:35,460
Nah he's old.

1272
01:04:35,460 --> 01:04:37,500
That has to be a negative.

1273
01:04:37,500 --> 01:04:42,740
Alright I'll minus one to it instead.

1274
01:04:42,740 --> 01:04:45,700
He's just putty in our hands tonight.

1275
01:04:45,700 --> 01:04:51,980
Now he sees you whimpering and he's like oh hey there fella you did a great job.

1276
01:04:51,980 --> 01:04:59,300
job driving the bus and he scrubs your head and then he just goes back to ordering his

1277
01:04:59,300 --> 01:05:00,300
Uber.

1278
01:05:00,300 --> 01:05:01,300
Oh my, how about driving me somewhere?

1279
01:05:01,300 --> 01:05:06,220
What are we trying to get him to do?

1280
01:05:06,220 --> 01:05:07,700
We're trying to get in the Uber dude.

1281
01:05:07,700 --> 01:05:08,700
Uber hasn't arrived.

1282
01:05:08,700 --> 01:05:09,700
We can wait for it.

1283
01:05:09,700 --> 01:05:10,700
Go.

1284
01:05:10,700 --> 01:05:11,700
What's up?

1285
01:05:11,700 --> 01:05:15,260
I have an ability too that I can try and make him do something.

1286
01:05:15,260 --> 01:05:16,980
Yeah, go for it.

1287
01:05:16,980 --> 01:05:17,980
Polly wants a what now?

1288
01:05:17,980 --> 01:05:36,700
the

1289
01:05:36,700 --> 01:05:52,180
the

1290
01:05:52,180 --> 01:05:53,180
*quack*

1291
01:05:53,180 --> 01:05:56,180
Where's Duluth? Take us to Duluth!

1292
01:05:56,180 --> 01:05:59,180
Um, and...

1293
01:05:59,180 --> 01:06:01,180
Okay, at that...

1294
01:06:01,180 --> 01:06:03,180
'Cause, uh...

1295
01:06:03,180 --> 01:06:06,180
Rolly dexterity saving throw, Pleasant Parrot.

1296
01:06:06,180 --> 01:06:08,180
Oh no.

1297
01:06:08,180 --> 01:06:10,180
Okay, uh...

1298
01:06:10,180 --> 01:06:12,180
Nine.

1299
01:06:12,180 --> 01:06:14,180
No, it says 21.

1300
01:06:14,180 --> 01:06:17,180
Uh...

1301
01:06:17,180 --> 01:06:18,180
No, it's a nine.

1302
01:06:18,180 --> 01:06:20,180
Uh, you...

1303
01:06:20,180 --> 01:06:21,180
Uh...

1304
01:06:21,180 --> 01:06:22,180
Uh oh.

1305
01:06:22,180 --> 01:06:23,180
It's not good.

1306
01:06:23,180 --> 01:06:24,180
Anytime it takes longer than one second, it's bad news for us.

1307
01:06:24,180 --> 01:06:25,180
Right, you know something really bad is going to happen.

1308
01:06:25,180 --> 01:06:26,180
Yeah.

1309
01:06:26,180 --> 01:06:27,180
You take six damage as a bullet comes shooting out of the air and into the side of your bird

1310
01:06:27,180 --> 01:06:28,180
body.

1311
01:06:28,180 --> 01:06:29,180
Oh my god.

1312
01:06:29,180 --> 01:06:30,180
Each bird can take a bullet and be alive?

1313
01:06:30,180 --> 01:06:31,180
I already got hit with a bullet on the last episode.

1314
01:06:31,180 --> 01:06:32,180
I'm not going to lie.

1315
01:06:32,180 --> 01:06:33,180
I'm not going to lie.

1316
01:06:33,180 --> 01:06:34,180
I'm not going to lie.

1317
01:06:34,180 --> 01:06:35,180
I'm not going to lie.

1318
01:06:35,180 --> 01:06:36,180
I'm not going to lie.

1319
01:06:36,180 --> 01:06:37,180
I'm not going to lie.

1320
01:06:37,180 --> 01:06:38,180
I'm not going to lie.

1321
01:06:38,180 --> 01:06:39,180
I'm not going to lie.

1322
01:06:39,180 --> 01:06:40,180
I'm not going to lie.

1323
01:06:40,180 --> 01:06:41,180
I'm not going to lie.

1324
01:06:41,180 --> 01:06:42,180
I'm not going to lie.

1325
01:06:42,180 --> 01:06:43,180
I'm not going to lie.

1326
01:06:43,180 --> 01:06:50,900
can take a bullet and be alive. I already got hit with a bullet on the last episode. That's

1327
01:06:50,900 --> 01:07:09,580
a sturdy bird. I took 6 damage right? Yeah. And suddenly you see 3 CIA agents come out

1328
01:07:09,580 --> 01:07:12,580
of the brush. Can one of them be Stan from American Dead?

1329
01:07:12,580 --> 01:07:19,580
Oh no! What? Can one of them be Stan from American Dead?

1330
01:07:19,580 --> 01:07:23,580
Yeah, they're all like, "Hey, I'm da Stan!"

1331
01:07:23,580 --> 01:07:28,580
Okay! Hey, alright, cool, I'm glad I said that.

1332
01:07:28,580 --> 01:07:31,580
Yeah, alright, so we have three Stans.

1333
01:07:31,580 --> 01:07:34,580
I'm Stan! I'm da Stan!

1334
01:07:34,580 --> 01:07:38,580
Yeah, I'm da Stan. They're kinda arguing around each other.

1335
01:07:38,580 --> 01:07:45,580
other

1336
01:07:45,580 --> 01:07:48,580
and

1337
01:07:48,580 --> 01:07:53,580
a

1338
01:07:53,580 --> 01:07:58,580
and

1339
01:07:58,580 --> 01:08:03,580
and

1340
01:08:03,580 --> 01:08:08,500
Van Dyke start to run away and the people start to run when they see a bullet.

1341
01:08:08,500 --> 01:08:12,180
They shoot Dick Van Dyke when he runs.

1342
01:08:12,180 --> 01:08:13,980
Dick Van Dyke, dead Van Dyke.

1343
01:08:13,980 --> 01:08:15,540
Dick Van Dyke.

1344
01:08:15,540 --> 01:08:20,940
He starts talking like his Mary Poppins character because his brain stops working.

1345
01:08:20,940 --> 01:08:25,020
By the time this comes out he might be dead.

1346
01:08:25,020 --> 01:08:29,580
So yeah, roll for initiative because the CIA is now after Pleasant Parrot.

1347
01:08:29,580 --> 01:08:30,580
I'm fucking ready.

1348
01:08:30,580 --> 01:08:31,580
I'm taking care of this one.

1349
01:08:31,580 --> 01:08:33,580
I'll take the other end.

1350
01:08:33,580 --> 01:08:38,580
There's a man who leads a life of danger

1351
01:08:38,580 --> 01:08:44,580
To everyone he meets he stays a stranger

1352
01:08:44,580 --> 01:08:50,580
When every move he makes, another chance he takes

1353
01:08:50,580 --> 01:08:55,580
Odds are he won't live to see tomorrow

1354
01:08:55,580 --> 01:09:02,580
Secret agent man, secret agent man

1355
01:09:02,580 --> 01:09:06,580
♪ And, baby, giving you a number ♪

1356
01:09:06,580 --> 01:09:10,240
♪ And taking away your name ♪

1357
01:09:10,240 --> 01:09:12,820
(upbeat music)
