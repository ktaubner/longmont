1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,580
(upbeat music)

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:09,480
- Wow.

3
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:10,780
- Are you gonna include that clap in the thing?

4
00:00:10,780 --> 00:00:11,760
I really hope not.

5
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:12,600
- We're back from our break.

6
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:13,980
- 'Cause I fucked it up.

7
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:16,180
- You didn't fuck it up, you did it fine.

8
00:00:16,180 --> 00:00:18,600
- I said, podclabalabalabalist.

9
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:19,740
- Yeah, but the words don't matter at all.

10
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:21,480
- It doesn't matter what is said.

11
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:22,780
- Tell that to fucking every,

12
00:00:22,780 --> 00:00:24,180
tell that to the Slater's union.

13
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:25,020
- That's correct.

14
00:00:25,020 --> 00:00:25,840
- Oh, the words don't matter.

15
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:26,680
Actually, they would probably like that,

16
00:00:26,680 --> 00:00:27,680
'cause they like to sit, it's a union,

17
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:28,960
they like to sit around and get a paycheck.

18
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:29,800
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

19
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:30,920
- Fuck 'em, get an insurance.

20
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:32,120
- It really doesn't matter.

21
00:00:32,120 --> 00:00:34,280
They just wanna,

22
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:36,840
they wanna be forced to do more work

23
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:38,640
so they can complain.

24
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:40,040
- They can complain more, yeah.

25
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:42,160
- Oh, I had to work a full work week.

26
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:45,520
- Oh no, I'm in a union.

27
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:48,480
- They fed me all this free food all day.

28
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:49,720
- I had to sit around,

29
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:52,320
I had to sit with a pickup truck where the bed was down.

30
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:53,840
I had to sit there and eat a sandwich.

31
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:55,400
- And I got to meet a celebrity.

32
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:58,280
- Yeah, they're in a union, an unholy union.

33
00:00:58,280 --> 00:01:01,500
that sex with us incubus and succubus at the same time

34
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:03,560

41
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,320

42
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:32,260
I don't know who that is. His wife.

43
00:01:32,260 --> 00:01:33,980
Oh, that makes sense.

44
00:01:33,980 --> 00:01:40,080
His ex-wife. That makes sense, that's who he was getting married to.

45
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:42,360
She did a Playboy shoot, Missy Rothstein, on the show.

46
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:46,000
If we were in the podcaster union, they'd make us fucking wear hard hats right now.

47
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,120
I wish I had a hard hat. We'd have to be clipped into this wall. And they would only let us do five minute episodes.

48
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:54,120
You have to do five minutes of talking and then take 55 minutes of break.

49
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:56,120
Wouldn't you guys hate that?

50
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:58,120
You have to take a 55 minutes smokers break

51
00:01:58,120 --> 00:02:00,120
because you're in the union.

52
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:02,120
Five minutes of podcasting, medium hard,

53
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:04,120
and then 55 minutes just sitting around.

54
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:06,120
Oh, it's so hard to work.

55
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:08,120
Oh, working is so hard.

56
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:10,120
I should have a raise.

57
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:12,120
You know what? Let's cut out that five minutes

58
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:14,120
and stop working entirely

59
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:16,120

60
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:18,120

108
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:05,060
probably having a dream that you got stabbed or something and then you die in

109
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:09,140
real life prove that okay you can't prove that all right that somebody was

right now you will not try to die no you won't and you won't like when I die

112
00:06:15,780 --> 00:06:19,020
I've had plenty of dreams where I thought I was falling or I thought I was

113
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:32,900
that

114
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:34,900
That is a crazy fire.

115
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:36,900
Is that an omen if you see that on New Year's Day?

116
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:38,900
Here, I'll play it again.

117
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:40,900
Is that...

118
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:42,900
Wait, it won't...

119
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:44,900
Let's see here.

120
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:46,900
Is this an omen?

121
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:48,900
Put it behind Juvia so it looks like

122
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:50,900
Wizard of Oz.

123
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:52,900
Oh wow, whoa.

124
00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:54,900
I don't even...

125
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:56,900
It's too hard.

126
00:06:56,900 --> 00:06:58,900
Wizard of Oz vibe.

127
00:06:58,900 --> 00:07:00,900
But do you think that's an omen to see a fire

128
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:04,340
there is just a skylights one of those things where it's like if a bird shits

129
00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:05,880
on you it's good luck

130
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:09,500
there was ash falling from the first shits on you it's good luck and that's a

131
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:12,420
thing that that's like no no so whoever came up with that came up with that

132
00:07:12,420 --> 00:07:16,760
because the right your bird shit on your head is a are you know a lot yeah

133
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:19,620
no that's why you have a lot of that's like when a parent tells the kid that

134
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:22,580
the ice cream truck plays music when it's only out of ice cream

135
00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:25,900
they're like when i get a really cool i got shit on by a bird

136
00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:28,980
no you know actually that's good what actually really actually do that we're

137
00:07:28,980 --> 00:07:32,500
going to get ice cream. I think that seeing a bunch of burning trees at the beginning of

138
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:37,140
the new year is actually good luck. Yeah, if you're Bob Marley. Yeah. Yeah, the firefighters

139
00:07:37,140 --> 00:07:42,080
didn't even care. They probably didn't. Okay, so I walked out of... You know arson, most

140
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:46,540
arsons are done by a firefighter. Is that true? Yeah. Well, listen to this. Firefighters...

141
00:07:46,540 --> 00:07:49,260
They get all horny when they see a fire. A lot of times you'll walk by a fire or something

142
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:53,380
and you think a firefighter is like... A lot of times. Oh, we're battling a fire. Yeah,

143
00:07:53,380 --> 00:07:57,460
I walk by a fire often. Three or four or five times in my life I've walked by a fire where

144
00:07:57,460 --> 00:07:58,620
there was firefighters there.

145
00:07:58,620 --> 00:08:00,300
And you always think it's gonna be like a--

146
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:02,780
- Have you walked by, well, when you like walk by a fire

147
00:08:02,780 --> 00:08:04,340
and there's no firefighters there?

148
00:08:04,340 --> 00:08:05,340
- Well, that's never happened to me.

149
00:08:05,340 --> 00:08:06,500
But when you walk by a fire,

150
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:09,400
you expect it to be like a painting

151
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:10,860
of the Revolutionary War,

152
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:12,460
and they're like charging in or whatever.

153
00:08:12,460 --> 00:08:14,180
A lot of these firefighters are in a union.

154
00:08:14,180 --> 00:08:15,580
- They don't care. - They're standing there.

155
00:08:15,580 --> 00:08:16,420
- They're standing up there,

156
00:08:16,420 --> 00:08:18,460
they're using the fire to light

157
00:08:18,460 --> 00:08:19,740
their fucking marijuana cigarette.

158
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:21,300
- I even took a video of them not,

159
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:23,020
I tried, I was like, okay,

160
00:08:23,020 --> 00:08:24,940
so the fire was going for a while.

161
00:08:24,940 --> 00:08:26,980
- Yeah, I can imagine. - And then the fire truck came,

162
00:08:26,980 --> 00:08:30,220
a bunch of fire trucks came and I was like, "Oh, I want to take a video of these firefighters

163
00:08:30,220 --> 00:08:36,620
putting out the fire." And this video is like a few minutes long and they just walk around.

164
00:08:36,620 --> 00:08:38,860
They just wait for the fire to get small.

165
00:08:38,860 --> 00:08:44,660
Dude, that's the crazy thing about firefighters. They're like, "Oh yeah, well the best course

166
00:08:44,660 --> 00:08:47,940
of action is we got to let it burn down a while before we can fight." It's like, how

167
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:52,380
fucking convenient is that for you? Like, "Oh, you have to wait two or three hours and

168
00:08:52,380 --> 00:08:53,380
sit around."

169
00:08:53,380 --> 00:08:54,380
Yeah.

170
00:08:54,380 --> 00:08:55,380
And also-

171
00:08:55,380 --> 00:08:56,380
They blocked my view.

172
00:08:56,380 --> 00:09:01,900
an EMS worker run? No. Fuck no dude. They pull up, your grandma's having a heart attack,

173
00:09:01,900 --> 00:09:05,660
they're like checking their Apple watch for their steps as they come up your fucking stairs.

174
00:09:05,660 --> 00:09:10,080
They got that Pokemon Go thing, like the Pokeball that you can click and then it catches the

175
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:15,920
Pokemon for you. EMS workers have to be bottom of the barrel, right? Because they're all trying

176
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:19,940
to get into nursing school. They're 19. Well I think they're the people that get out of

177
00:09:19,940 --> 00:09:23,820
nursing school. I think they're the like, "Ah shit, I became a nurse, but now I want

178
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:28,480
to be a thrill seeker. Yeah, I think it's the nursing school people, but then there's also

179
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:33,300
there's a subset of people who are just like, "I'm just going to do something crazy." It's

180
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:37,880
like the lamer version of being like, "I'm going to go join the army because I don't know

181
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:42,100
what to do." The army's cool, man. That's why I said the EMS is the lamer version of

182
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:50,940
joining the army for no reason. My uncle was an Air Force medic in Afghanistan. He did the

183
00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:56,460
combination the you're a little plane no I didn't he flew an ambulance he was just

184
00:09:56,460 --> 00:09:59,580
a he didn't even learn out of both of my uncles are in the Air Force neither of

185
00:09:59,580 --> 00:10:02,220
them know how to fly a fucking plane well next time you see him tell him to suck

00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:06,660

188
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:15,740
before yeah see you hear that uncle Bobby and uncle Paul you never use your

189
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:17,820
- Are your balls like a scrub daddy

190
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:19,260
to get stuff out of your fingernails?

191
00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:20,460
- No. - Nope.

192
00:10:20,460 --> 00:10:22,840
- Me neither.

193
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:23,860
- Wait, how?

194
00:10:23,860 --> 00:10:25,380
- You just like, 'cause it's kinda putty,

195
00:10:25,380 --> 00:10:26,980
you kinda like slide it in there.

196
00:10:26,980 --> 00:10:28,380
- What, your balls? - How big is the space

197
00:10:28,380 --> 00:10:29,540
in your fingernails?

198
00:10:29,540 --> 00:10:32,060
- No, no, my balls are just really like putty-ish.

199
00:10:32,060 --> 00:10:33,660
- They get really thin?

200
00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:34,700
- At the ends, yeah.

201
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:36,220
At the ends of the sharp-- - Like a bristle?

202
00:10:36,220 --> 00:10:37,060
- Corners.

203
00:10:37,060 --> 00:10:38,140
Yeah, in a way, yeah.

204
00:10:38,140 --> 00:10:38,980
- Bristle? - I mean, I don't know.

205
00:10:38,980 --> 00:10:40,860
- You got like a brillo pad down there?

206
00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:41,700
- No, no, no, no, no, it's like a--

207
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:43,700
- It's covered in glue soap.

208
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:44,700
- How do I explain this?

209
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:45,960
It's really like... You can just show us.

210
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:48,260
I guess I could. I've showed you guys my balls before.

211
00:10:48,260 --> 00:10:49,540
Oh, I've seen your balls many times.

212
00:10:49,540 --> 00:10:51,180
And you said, "Those are huge."

213
00:10:51,180 --> 00:10:52,180
Yeah.

214
00:10:52,180 --> 00:10:55,500
I remember that.

215
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:58,220
That was a little feather in my cap compliment.

216
00:10:58,220 --> 00:11:01,780
That was like when an old lady cat cheers

217
00:11:01,780 --> 00:11:02,980
because you're handsome.

218
00:11:02,980 --> 00:11:03,980
They were...

219
00:11:03,980 --> 00:11:07,620
They looked big and like you had a tumor on them.

220
00:11:07,620 --> 00:11:09,660
You're backpedaling.

221
00:11:09,660 --> 00:11:10,660
It was like I was concerned.

222
00:11:10,660 --> 00:11:11,660
He's backpedaling.

223
00:11:11,660 --> 00:11:12,660
Yeah.

224
00:11:12,660 --> 00:11:13,660
No, you were embarrassed.

225
00:11:13,660 --> 00:11:14,660
You were embarrassed.

226
00:11:14,660 --> 00:11:21,820

300
00:13:56,920 --> 00:14:02,040
that's huge yeah I'm probably gonna go in there by some some kind of fudgy fudge

301
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:07,200
Fudge mostly. Or some kind of maybe one of those food activities. What I did buy with that

302
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:13,960
was that South Park game Stick of Truth and then I spent three days just not

303
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:18,760
doing anything but play that. Yeah yeah man I was just you know I mean I... No

304
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:22,360
replay value on that game. I hate to say it but I'm back on my golf shit. Yeah.

305
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:26,880
Seriously I'm back. This always happens at the new year. Every time I go to Christmas I come

306
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:31,640
back and I'm a golfer again. Yeah. So it happened again I got the bug. I pretty

307
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:36,840
much was playing some of my best golf ever. My grandpa Pete out there who's been

308
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:41,200
sending some pretty racial stuff out there on the golf course.

309
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:46,240
And at that point you just you just got to ignore that. You know he's at that age

310
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:51,360
where you just gotta go yep. What stays on the court stays on the court.

311
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:56,800
Yeah. I mean the course. He's calling the golf course the court. Yeah. I'm not a golfer.

312
00:14:56,800 --> 00:15:00,680
I never claimed to be a golfer. Okay. The thing that is different though I'm his

313
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:04,760
grandson so it's all gravy for me I just don't care right he's only got a couple

314
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:09,880
years left god bless him but this other fucking guy this young younger guy like

315
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:14,600
college kid joins our grandpa's friend you know no he just joins because he's

316
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:17,720
playing behind us he joins our now get this you guys are gonna laugh at this

317
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:21,360
he joins our threesome it becomes a foursome that's what it's called when you

318
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:25,440
I'm not even gonna go there I know I know I know and grant great-granddad

319
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:28,720
immediately starts talking to him about yeah what's your school like is there we

320
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:32,800
got black guys on the fucking basketball team and that dude that dude put up with

321
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:37,240
it like he was his grandson and it's like no you guy you don't know him you got to

322
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:41,720
put it into that but he was you're not supposed to you're supposed to let every

323
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:46,040
old person do that no I don't think so I think if you're not related to them

324
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:50,400
also if you're joining their golf group you can't you can't come into someone's

325
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:54,120
golf group yeah and it was way better at golf than maybe you know what the place

326
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:57,720
that the place that you should is if you guys are like boxing each other or

327
00:15:57,720 --> 00:15:59,720
something that's okay to be like

328
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:02,040
fuck you yeah that shit but i don't

329
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:03,680
really want to store the golf course

330
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:06,840
might be the last possible sport that

331
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:08,720
you want to be challenging also

332
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:10,600
everybody who plays golf is going to

333
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:14,000
talk about that's all gone there off

334
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,120
is probably I resent that accusation

335
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:18,360
what why that all golfers talk about

336
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:20,040
black guys who said you're talking about

337
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:21,800
black guys with your grip no I wasn't

338
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:24,920
talking like yeah yeah yeah I was a

339
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:28,640
I was saying, I was like, I was completely okay with it.

340
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:30,640
I was saying, yep, yep, yep, yes, yes, yes.

341
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:31,640
No, no, no.

342
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:33,800
I was basically zoning out way off into the distance.

343
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:37,280
I was looking, I was thinking about my golf game and he's just telling me about Tiger

344
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:38,280
Woods all the shit.

345
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:39,280
I'm going, yeah, for sure.

346
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:40,280
You're saying, yeah, for sure.

347
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:43,080
I'm not actively engaging in a conversation.

348
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:45,880
I'm not, it's not like, oh, what's next on the list today?

349
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:46,880
Like we're going through the fucking around the horn and it says black guys.

350
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:51,480
If I was there and I heard someone say something about black guys and that was offensive, I

351
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:53,160
I would be like, I'm gonna stare at you

352
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:55,320
until you realize what was wrong about what you said.

353
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:57,240
- Yeah, or you could like--

354
00:16:57,240 --> 00:16:59,160
- Or I'd box him, or get a hole in one.

355
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:01,280
- Yeah, this just became boxing, Pete.

356
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:02,120
- Uh-huh.

357
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:03,120
- Oh no.

358
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:07,040
But yeah, he, but that guy who played with us,

359
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:08,920
that guy Nick, pretty good golfer Nick,

360
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:11,560
if you're listening, put me to shame.

361
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:13,600
Me and my brother kept saying nasty shit to him

362
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:15,760
just trying to get him to crack, he wouldn't do anything.

363
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:16,840
- Oh, crack what?

364
00:17:16,840 --> 00:17:17,680
- Crack up?

365
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:18,500
- What did you say?

366
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:19,780
- Crack like, you know what, screw you guys,

367
00:17:19,780 --> 00:17:24,240
going home South Park reference. We were just sitting there talking about we wanted to

368
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:27,800
like eat his cum and shit trying to fucking throwing off his game and he was

369
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:32,740
hitting just fucking cherry drives right down the fairway. Yeah. Your first thought

370
00:17:32,740 --> 00:17:37,240
when you like a guy joins your golf foursome is say I'm gonna make you eat my

371
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:41,760
cum. I didn't, no no I said I'll eat your, we were just slipping it in. Oh so you're gonna eat

372
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:46,000
his cum. Yeah we were saying like I'll eat your cum if you want and then he would hit the

373
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:50,440
most amazing shot ever and he would just like, he'd go, "Oh!" and then just hit a beautiful

374
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:51,440
shot.

375
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:52,440
You're probably making him stronger.

376
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:53,440
I think so, yeah.

377
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:54,440
Yeah.

378
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:55,440
Yeah.

379
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:56,440
But that's a fun game.

380
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:59,640
I would get better at golf if someone told me that they would eat my cone.

381
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:03,800
Yeah, that's huge because that's beyond saying like, "Hey, I like your shorts."

382
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:06,240
That's about as big as they get on the golf course, right?

383
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:08,360
Being like, "Buddy, I'll eat your cum any day."

384
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:09,880
Are you allowed to wear shorts on golf?

385
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:10,880
Yeah.

386
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:11,880
Yeah.

387
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:12,880
Interesting.

388
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:13,880
Interesting.

389
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:14,880
You know what they make is, they make like Jordans.

390
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:19,760
sport of all time. On weekdays you can wear shorts. They make Jordans with golf cleats

391
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:25,720
in them. Yeah I have some golf shoes. Do you have to wear golf Jordans? I have New Balances.

392
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:30,800
Oh ok. Why do you have to wear cleats to play golf? Because it keeps you stable. You run

393
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:35,440
around a lot? But some courses you can't even wear the cleats. I run around a lot. Barefoot?

394
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:41,440
No. I'm doing my new type of golf game. I invented it called fast golf. You're kidding

395
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:48,440
but I literally... I carry the ball, I pick up the ball and I run with it to the hole and I put it in and I smile and I look at everyone and I wave like I'm four years old.

396
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:53,640
You are hitting but when I am done with a hole, if I'm playing with people who are decent at golf, I'm like

397
00:18:53,640 --> 00:19:00,420
completely out of breath and I've ran the entire way because I'm hitting my ball and then you're ten yards at a time running to it

398
00:19:00,420 --> 00:19:06,180
hitting again. I hit it 13 times in a hole. Everybody else has hit it four. Like mini golf. Yeah, and I'm sprinting. Just like mini golf.

399
00:19:06,180 --> 00:19:08,420
Yeah. Golf is a lot like mini golf.

400
00:19:10,260 --> 00:19:15,380
Yeah, no, it's I'm pretty terrible. I had one good around it seems like it's really hard to be good

401
00:19:15,380 --> 00:19:19,020
It's the hardest game of it. Yeah, it draws me. I suck at mini golf

402
00:19:19,020 --> 00:19:21,200
It's got my golf is no humans

403
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:25,920
What I said, I suck at mini golf and golf is way bigger golf is a massive version of me

404
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:31,340
Yeah, it's maxi golf and there's no fun part. I hate there's no fun. There's no fun toys that bar built-in

405
00:19:31,340 --> 00:19:37,400
I hate golf because all that land could be used to actually to do what house the houseless. Would you buy this?

406
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:39,400
Would you build those houses?

407
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:40,400
Oh no!

408
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:41,400
That's right!

409
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:47,400
We have the wrong set on to tickle him today.

410
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:48,400
Yeah.

411
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:49,400
Okay, scoot your chair back in.

412
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:50,400
Alright, gotta scoot that back out.

413
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:51,400
Woo!

414
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:52,400
Oh my god.

415
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:54,120
That was a close one.

416
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:55,880
We almost had a catastrophic fit.

417
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:58,720
We should, we need to be in the video.

418
00:19:58,720 --> 00:19:59,720
We both died!

419
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:00,720
Oh my god.

420
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:03,680
That would have been a full Buster Keaton, I could have gone and...

421
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:04,680
Yeah, yeah.

422
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:07,400
And I did a real bad job doing that, there's a ton of nails in the back.

423
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:13,240
There's nails and look this is just a piece of tape. Yeah. Don't touch it you fucking asshole. Don't slap me.

424
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:17,960
Speaking of this thing, what is it? It's the Dungeons & Dragons set. Oh yeah this is

425
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:21,920
set from the Dungeons & Dragons episodes. Go check out those. Go look at that.

426
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:24,280
We're already on the Patreon, it's basically just one little click. I don't

427
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:30,520
even think it even charges you any extra money. I don't think it even does

428
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:33,520
anything. So you might as well just press the button. And you know what? And the

429
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:36,160
- The smarter thing to do is just make yourself

430
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:38,200
an executive producer, 'cause you get that,

431
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:40,600
and you get this episode, and you get that,

432
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:42,200
and you get to go on a meeting with us.

433
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:43,600
- And it's all the same price.

434
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:46,800
- And it's all the same increments of five.

435
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:47,640
- Price.

436
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:50,920
- What are you opening up the mail account for?

437
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:51,760
- Yeah, close the email.

438
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:52,840
- Juvio, what the hell are you doing, man?

439
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:53,760
- He's acting weird.

440
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:55,200
- Wait, show us the big Juvio cam.

441
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:56,080
- Yeah.

442
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:57,680
- I wanna see the big Juvio cam again.

443
00:20:57,680 --> 00:20:58,960
- Why are you laughing?

444
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:00,280
- Why are you so ashamed?

445
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:02,160
(laughing)

446
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:04,160
Why are you so ashamed?

447
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:06,160
Oh, he's gone.

448
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:08,160
He's so ashamed. He tried to open up some mail thing and he

449
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:10,160
He was trying to prank us and he fucked it up.

450
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:12,160
Fucking idiot.

451
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:14,160
Yeah, we got you. He's embarrassed.

452
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:16,160
Yeah, we got you.

453
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:18,160
I don't think I'm ever going to be embarrassed again.

454
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:20,160
Whoa, that's a big New Year's resolution.

455
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:22,160
Yep. I think mine is to save more money.

456
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:24,160
I shouldn't have said that in front of everybody.

457
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:26,160
You're so embarrassed aren't you? Nope.

458
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:28,160
I think I'm going to do a hundred

459
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:30,160
backflips a day.

460
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:35,240
a day. Yeah, that will be good for you. Yeah. Actually, I think I maybe... I might copy that.

461
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:38,880
Maybe that's what I'll try to do this year. I might do 101 a day. Maybe I'll do one backflip.

462
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:42,400
A flat ground backflip. Yeah. I think I could do it. I think it's a mental thing for me.

463
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:46,600
It's... I'm a 48-inch vertical jump. You can look up how to do a backflip. Can you pull

464
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:50,520
up how to do a backflip on YouTube, do you know? I can do one on a trampoline all day.

465
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:54,600
I mean, we could just turn the cameras around and you could attempt it. I'm not gonna attempt

466
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:58,520
it live right now. Why not? 'Cause I'll hurt myself, man. You won't hurt yourself. I will

467
00:21:58,520 --> 00:21:59,640
I'll hurt myself hardly.

468
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:01,040
You won't hurt yourself.

469
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:04,000
Wow, there's some great fucking podcast clips up here.

470
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,120
Backflipping 30, hey, I know that guy.

471
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:08,520
Who is that guy?

472
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:10,320
Wanna learn a backflip in just 30 days?

473
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:11,140
(laughing)

474
00:22:11,140 --> 00:22:13,400
Wait, it takes 30 days to learn a backflip?

475
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:14,960
Holy shit.

476
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:15,800
Whoa.

477
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:16,640
You know, I don't care.

478
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:17,480
I'll learn myself on my own time.

479
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:19,320
It looks like this guy can already backflip.

480
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:20,760
This is company time, right?

481
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:23,800
Why am I wasting company time on my New Year's resolution?

482
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:25,800
Oh, hey, your time is more important

483
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:26,620
than company time. Why was that shot

484
00:22:26,620 --> 00:22:27,500
in the Dutch angle?

485
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:28,340
Union.

486
00:22:28,340 --> 00:22:32,740
he makes a bunch of videos. He makes videos where he's like, "I only ate fucking corn

487
00:22:32,740 --> 00:22:33,740
for 30 days."

488
00:22:33,740 --> 00:22:35,340
He's like a dolphin on land.

489
00:22:35,340 --> 00:22:38,460
Yeah, he is. He does have a fucked up kind of look to him.

490
00:22:38,460 --> 00:22:39,460
Yeah.

491
00:22:39,460 --> 00:22:44,860
He's one of those guys whose square head disappears into his body. You know what I mean?

492
00:22:44,860 --> 00:22:46,180
He's doing a macaque.

493
00:22:46,180 --> 00:22:49,100
I can do a macaque and I can do an arm swing technique.

494
00:22:49,100 --> 00:22:50,100
I can't do that.

495
00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:51,100
I can't do that.

496
00:22:51,100 --> 00:22:52,100
That's easy.

497
00:22:52,100 --> 00:22:56,940
I don't know how to do an arm swing technique. I can't do this either. I can't do any of

498
00:22:56,940 --> 00:22:57,940
this stuff.

499
00:22:57,940 --> 00:22:59,100
- No problem. - You're gonna learn to--

500
00:22:59,100 --> 00:23:01,240
- So are these the building blocks of a backflip?

501
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:03,340
Is this like when you watch like a

502
00:23:03,340 --> 00:23:05,420
how to do a kickflip tutorial and it's like,

503
00:23:05,420 --> 00:23:08,020
to learn that, you have to learn how to do an ollie first.

504
00:23:08,020 --> 00:23:10,100
- I wanna learn how to do an ollie pretty badly.

505
00:23:10,100 --> 00:23:10,940
- Yeah. - Maybe that'll be

506
00:23:10,940 --> 00:23:12,380
my New Year's resolution. - I could teach you.

507
00:23:12,380 --> 00:23:13,900
- No you couldn't, I'm unteachable.

508
00:23:13,900 --> 00:23:16,180
I'm one of those unteachable, I'm an unteachable maverick.

509
00:23:16,180 --> 00:23:17,980
- It's literally, doing an ollie is like

510
00:23:17,980 --> 00:23:19,460
one of the easiest things in the world.

511
00:23:19,460 --> 00:23:21,220
- Not for an unteachable maverick.

512
00:23:21,220 --> 00:23:23,380
- Yeah. - Good luck finding me a master.

513
00:23:23,380 --> 00:23:25,060
I'm self-taught on everything. - Most stuff is difficult

514
00:23:25,060 --> 00:23:52,500

The skateboard hero and the anti-semite.

531
00:25:00,100 --> 00:25:02,100
Is Aaron Cairo an anti-semite?

532
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:04,100
I mean, maybe. I don't know.

533

- I wouldn't listen to them.

547
00:25:42,100 --> 00:25:44,620
(laughing)

548
00:25:44,620 --> 00:25:45,620
- Even the food guy?

549
00:25:45,620 --> 00:25:48,460

550
00:25:48,460 --> 00:25:49,300

00:25:49,300 --> 00:25:51,180
- That's all I would say.

552
00:25:51,180 --> 00:25:53,260
They would say, so what you're gonna wanna do

553
00:25:53,260 --> 00:25:55,420
is do this, put this painting up in your house.

554
00:25:55,420 --> 00:25:57,020
I'd go, no.

555
00:25:57,020 --> 00:25:57,860
- No, no, no.

556
00:25:57,860 --> 00:25:59,900
- I'd move my head like I was gonna go like, no.

557
00:25:59,900 --> 00:26:01,700
But I would go, no.

558
00:26:01,700 --> 00:26:04,260
(laughing)

559
00:26:04,260 --> 00:26:06,420
- That would, I saw one the other day.

560
00:26:06,420 --> 00:26:08,700
- What's the food guy's name, Antony?

561
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:14,700
Anthony and Karamo. Karamo. Karamo. I would listen to Karamo. Karamo is cool.

562
00:26:14,700 --> 00:26:18,780
Anthony though, Anthony's like not good at making food. Karamo just dresses normal.

563
00:26:18,780 --> 00:26:23,900
Yeah, what does he teach them to do? Avocado toast? He literally does. He teaches them avocado toast.

564
00:26:23,900 --> 00:26:31,340
And then what did I what did I say? I think like four years ago they partnered with Whole Foods

565
00:26:31,340 --> 00:26:36,380
and it was like Anthony's like awesome summer recipes and he made grilled romaine lettuce.

566
00:26:37,020 --> 00:26:38,020
I've eaten that.

567
00:26:38,020 --> 00:26:39,020
I've eaten that.

568
00:26:39,020 --> 00:26:42,740
It's the funniest thing I've ever seen.

569
00:26:42,740 --> 00:26:46,460
It's just him putting lettuce on a grill.

570
00:26:46,460 --> 00:26:47,460
I think I have a thing.

571
00:26:47,460 --> 00:26:48,460
I think I could have a thing.

572
00:26:48,460 --> 00:26:49,980
I've had a grilled salad.

573
00:26:49,980 --> 00:26:54,100
I feel like if I was on Queer Eye, I could maybe have a thing or two to teach them.

574
00:26:54,100 --> 00:26:55,580
Especially about the food.

575
00:26:55,580 --> 00:27:00,780
I bet they don't know how to eat a PB&J sandwich over the sink.

576
00:27:00,780 --> 00:27:02,220
I bet they've never done that before.

577
00:27:02,220 --> 00:27:04,380
I do that three times a day.

578
00:27:04,380 --> 00:27:07,140
- Hey, we are gonna put some seasoning in your food,

579
00:27:07,140 --> 00:27:08,380
my friend. - Yeah, yeah.

580
00:27:08,380 --> 00:27:10,620
- You white man. - This is how to eat a pretzel.

581
00:27:10,620 --> 00:27:12,860
(laughing)

582
00:27:12,860 --> 00:27:14,560
- Yep, yep. - You go like this.

583
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:16,380
(laughing)

584
00:27:16,380 --> 00:27:17,740
- That's what's so important about that show

585
00:27:17,740 --> 00:27:19,300
is that everyone learns from each other.

586
00:27:19,300 --> 00:27:20,660
- Yeah, exactly. - It creates some kind

587
00:27:20,660 --> 00:27:23,220
of mind meld in the end.

588
00:27:23,220 --> 00:27:27,700
I saw one the other day, they do an entire high school.

589
00:27:27,700 --> 00:27:29,340
They go into a high school. - They clear out a high school.

590
00:27:29,340 --> 00:27:31,220
- They clear out all the kids in the high school,

591
00:27:31,220 --> 00:27:33,300
or all the prom kids or some shit.

592
00:27:33,300 --> 00:27:34,380
I don't remember.

593
00:27:34,380 --> 00:27:35,500
I wasn't really watching it.

594
00:27:35,500 --> 00:27:38,580
But they did a makeover with all the kids.

595
00:27:38,580 --> 00:27:41,660
- You know what?

596
00:27:41,660 --> 00:27:45,160
That sounds like you watched some propaganda shit.

597
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:48,100
- It kind of was, yeah, it was.

598
00:27:48,100 --> 00:27:49,900
They made all these kids wear tuxedos.

599
00:27:49,900 --> 00:27:51,380
- Oh my God. - Oh, what the fuck?

600
00:27:51,380 --> 00:27:53,380
- Yeah, that's purely sexualizing.

601
00:27:53,380 --> 00:27:56,340
- That's sexualizing, that's leftist ass propaganda.

602
00:27:56,340 --> 00:27:57,500
- Who else wears a tuxedo?

603
00:27:57,500 --> 00:27:58,320
- James Bond.

604
00:27:58,320 --> 00:27:59,700
- Justin Timberlake, suit and tie.

605
00:27:59,700 --> 00:28:01,220
♪ As long as I got my suit and tie ♪

606
00:28:01,220 --> 00:28:02,220
Gay men.

00:28:02,220 --> 00:28:03,220
Justin Timberlake.

608
00:28:03,220 --> 00:28:09,140
I'm gonna have sex with Jessica Biel, my wife.

609
00:28:09,140 --> 00:28:10,140
She was foin.

610
00:28:10,140 --> 00:28:11,140
Chuck and Larry.

611
00:28:11,140 --> 00:28:13,740
You know, I saw today in a very, very...

612
00:28:13,740 --> 00:28:15,340
Suit and tie, two male guys.

613
00:28:15,340 --> 00:28:20,260
As long as I have my suit and tie, I can have sex with two male guys.

614
00:28:20,260 --> 00:28:23,300
Show me their poop thing.

615
00:28:23,300 --> 00:28:24,300
Their butts.

616
00:28:24,300 --> 00:28:25,300
Their butts.

617
00:28:25,300 --> 00:28:26,140
- Dang.

618
00:28:26,140 --> 00:28:27,220
- Their butts.

619
00:28:27,220 --> 00:28:28,980
- Their butts.

620
00:28:28,980 --> 00:28:29,820
- Actually, if I was on Queer Eye,

621
00:28:29,820 --> 00:28:30,780
I would take all the advice,

622
00:28:30,780 --> 00:28:32,540
but every time I would do, I would say,

623
00:28:32,540 --> 00:28:33,960
you know I'm just gonna stop doing this

624
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:35,340
once you guys leave, right?

625
00:28:35,340 --> 00:28:37,260
- Doesn't it feel like Queer Eye?

626
00:28:37,260 --> 00:28:39,500
(laughing)

627
00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:41,260
- And then they'd dress me up,

628
00:28:41,260 --> 00:28:42,780
and I'd be like, this is great,

629
00:28:42,780 --> 00:28:45,460
but you realize I'm gonna throw this all away.

630
00:28:45,460 --> 00:28:48,900
- Yeah, I really love these shorts from Target.

631
00:28:48,900 --> 00:28:52,380
- Man, I used to love Queer Eye,

632
00:28:52,380 --> 00:28:54,700
but now it just feels like they've gone so woke.

633
00:28:54,700 --> 00:28:56,940
(laughing)

634
00:28:56,940 --> 00:28:58,620
- Ah, I hate it.

635
00:28:58,620 --> 00:29:01,060
They fucking go woke, go broke.

636
00:29:01,060 --> 00:29:02,900
- Yeah, GVN used to be so funny,

637
00:29:02,900 --> 00:29:05,780
but then they started doing all that fucking.

638
00:29:05,780 --> 00:29:08,860
- They've just gone so woke on queer, I hate that bullshit.

639
00:29:08,860 --> 00:29:10,820
I watched a video today,

640
00:29:10,820 --> 00:29:15,820
2022 top five times Hollywood went woke and went broke.

641
00:29:15,820 --> 00:29:17,500
- Turned broke by being woke?

642
00:29:17,500 --> 00:29:20,900
- Turns out G4 went woke, and then they went broke afterwards.

643
00:29:20,900 --> 00:29:22,100
Can you, G4.

644
00:29:22,100 --> 00:29:22,980

671
00:30:42,580 --> 00:30:48,180
easy to put fangs on him. Yeah but they have G4 apparently. They tried to bring G4 back

672
00:30:48,180 --> 00:30:53,380
and then they tried to go completely woke. Can you believe that? Yeah.

673
00:30:53,380 --> 00:31:00,820
John Mulaney had a kid with Olivia Munn and then that like made everyone

674
00:31:00,820 --> 00:31:06,020
was like "Oh he's not actually a wife guy because he cheated on his wife" and then

675
00:31:06,020 --> 00:31:10,060
it was like yeah he's fun. John Mulaney, what do you think that was a good guy?

676

691
00:31:52,980 --> 00:31:55,140
Who did he get to instead of Olivia Munn?

692
00:31:55,140 --> 00:31:58,140
- Olivia Munn, he got to Olivia Munn instead of his wife.

693
00:31:58,140 --> 00:31:59,460
- He got to have a kid with her.

694
00:31:59,460 --> 00:32:01,900
- He got her, but he was married to another.

695
00:32:01,900 --> 00:32:02,720
- Yeah.

696
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:03,560

698
00:32:04,380 --> 00:32:05,220
- Married to another.

699
00:32:05,220 --> 00:32:07,900
That's sad.

700
00:32:07,900 --> 00:32:08,940
- Okay, I couldn't remember.

701
00:32:08,940 --> 00:32:11,300
First I thought maybe she and him was already.

702
00:32:11,300 --> 00:32:12,140
- No.

703
00:32:12,140 --> 00:32:12,960
- No, I don't think.

704
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:14,800
- She and him was on the side.

705
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:15,640
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

706
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:17,040
- She and him, what's that?

707
00:32:17,040 --> 00:32:18,800
Zooey Deschanel and that fucking other guy

708
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:20,080
did sing Christmas songs?

709
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:22,080
- That's a sucked ass. - The Property Brother.

710
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:23,560
- She's married to one of the Property Brothers.

711
00:32:23,560 --> 00:32:24,400
- Zooey is?

712
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:25,320
- Yeah, I watched, I--

713
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:26,720
- What?

714
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:28,080
- Oh yeah, I did know that actually.

715
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:28,920
- No shit.

716
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:29,880
- Yeah.

717
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:32,080
- That's awesome.

718
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:34,800
- The one who does the handyman stuff.

719
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:35,640
- They both do the handyman stuff.

720
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:38,240
- They're both the same, they're not interchangeable.

721
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:40,840
- One of them is so much Property Brothers

722
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:42,080
and they're not interchangeable.

723
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:44,480
One of them wears a vest and the other one wears a flannel.

724
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:45,480
They are interchangeable.

725
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:46,480
Yes, they are.

726
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:49,360
No, I'm a Property Brothers expert and there's no difference.

727
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:50,360
It's Drew and Michael, right?

728
00:32:50,360 --> 00:32:51,920
Yeah, right, you're a Property Brothers expert.

729
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:52,920
No.

730
00:32:52,920 --> 00:32:53,920
Drew Michael's a comedian.

731
00:32:53,920 --> 00:32:56,640
No, no, Drew and Michael Property.

732
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:57,640
They're not named Michael.

733
00:32:57,640 --> 00:33:01,320
It's Jay and Pharaoh.

734
00:33:01,320 --> 00:33:03,880
I don't remember their names, but they're not that...

735
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:05,800
I'm pretty sure one of them is named Drew.

736
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:08,800
I think that's right, maybe, but there's definitely not one named Michael.

737
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:12,920
You might be the Property Brothers expert, but I'm a Chip and Joanna Gaines expert.

738
00:33:12,920 --> 00:33:14,320
You might be a Property Brother.

739
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:15,320
Oh, yeah.

740
00:33:15,320 --> 00:33:16,320
I'm a fixer-upper.

741
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:17,320
Yeah, yeah.

742
00:33:17,320 --> 00:33:18,320
I'll watch that all day.

743
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:19,320
That's pretty good.

744
00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:20,320
One time, he ate a cockroach.

745
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:21,320
Yeah, yeah.

746
00:33:21,320 --> 00:33:22,320
Right off the ground.

747
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:23,320
Crazy son of a bitch.

748
00:33:23,320 --> 00:33:26,780
I was about to say something that I love about the Property Brothers, but we already talked

749
00:33:26,780 --> 00:33:27,780
about it.

750
00:33:27,780 --> 00:33:28,780
We did?

751
00:33:28,780 --> 00:33:29,780
Yeah.

752
00:33:29,780 --> 00:33:30,780
It's a long time ago.

753
00:33:30,780 --> 00:33:31,780
They always make women touch dirt.

754
00:33:31,780 --> 00:33:32,780
Oh, yeah.

755
00:33:32,780 --> 00:33:33,780
I've heard you mention this before.

756
00:33:33,780 --> 00:33:34,780
Yeah, you should.

757
00:33:34,780 --> 00:33:37,000
They go, "Look how gross this is."

758
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:41,480
and they are nasty there's a lot of how it meant so we did you know

And it was a really quiet, it was a very quiet movie.

829
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:46,280
It's a lot of women looking at each other and not talking.

830
00:36:46,280 --> 00:36:47,280
Portrait of a Lady on Fire.

831
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:49,000
It's a movie for sapphics.

832
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:50,480
It's a sapphic movie.

833
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:52,080
And I saw it in a movie theater.

834
00:36:52,080 --> 00:36:56,160

835
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:59,320
theater next door so we were just watching like these two women just like

836
00:36:59,320 --> 00:37:02,200
looking at you like and then just like there were just like all these others

837
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:14,800
like it was really making me enjoy it shouldn't be like a wide release it

838
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:19,000
should be played at like a movie theater that has 15 seats that's not at the

839
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:24,040
Coolidge Corner Theater. Oh, that's a good theater. I miss that theater.

840
00:37:24,040 --> 00:37:28,760
Every DVD should have... it shouldn't be... the Doom setting shouldn't be like

841
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:31,800
you're playing a character in the movie though. It should be literally like it

842
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:36,520
should open and it should say "epilogue" and then it should fade into first

843
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:41,320
person Doom guy at whatever the scene was and then you can kill whoever you want from the movie.

844
00:37:41,320 --> 00:37:44,840
It's like Sex and the City. It's as soon as the...

845
00:37:44,840 --> 00:37:49,420

847
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:02,640
TAR is about our is a TAR counts as a girl movie because the guys who like it

848
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:08,200
are girly okay what is TAR about it's about a composer that gets me to eat

849
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:14,000
Blanchette I mean that's a win for the guys yeah it's a movie where the fellas

850
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:20,180
for sure it's all about music and I read I was like I was like should I go see

851
00:38:20,180 --> 00:38:25,480
this it's really fucking beautiful yeah it's actually not beautiful at all

852
00:38:25,480 --> 00:38:32,960
but I watch I read the whole Wikipedia when she is 13 then I read it I read at

853
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:38,280
the end of the movie that... Don't spoil the end of the movie. Go ahead, just spoil it.

854
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:41,840
Why would you do that? It's a really good ending. But what's the point? It's just a

855
00:38:41,840 --> 00:38:45,760
movie ending. The song that she plays at the end is from a video game. Yeah,

856
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:50,520
that's just... Why are you saying this? Still Alive from Portal? Yes. It's just part of

857
00:38:50,520 --> 00:38:55,320
the movie. She composes Still Alive. Oh my god. You're just saying a joke from a movie that you

858
00:38:55,320 --> 00:38:59,720
read on Wikipedia. It's a joke from the movie? It's a funny thing that happens at

859
00:38:59,720 --> 00:39:00,720
the end of the movie.

860
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:03,720
Oh shit, well I didn't see it.

861
00:39:03,720 --> 00:39:04,720
But if it's still alive, that is pretty funny.

862
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:08,720
I didn't see it and then I was like, well it's from that, I kind of want to see it.

863
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:09,720
It's a good movie.

864
00:39:09,720 --> 00:39:10,720
Yeah.

865
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:11,720
It's from Monster Hunter.

866
00:39:11,720 --> 00:39:12,720
He's been bending TAR so hard.

867
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:16,280
I don't even like it that much, it's just a good movie.

868
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:17,280
I don't know.

869
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:19,720
I'm pretty sure everyone who listens to this show has already seen TAR.

870
00:39:19,720 --> 00:39:20,720
Probably.

871
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:21,720
I don't know.

872
00:39:21,720 --> 00:39:22,720
You hope not?

873
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:24,680
I hope everyone sees Avatar.

874
00:39:24,680 --> 00:39:25,680
That's two TARs.

875
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:26,680

876
00:39:26,680 --> 00:39:28,840
I have a funny ass display name for you.

877
00:39:28,840 --> 00:39:30,840
Oh, I thought of this one already.

878
00:39:30,840 --> 00:39:31,840
What?

879
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:33,840
I don't even want to say it.

880
00:39:33,840 --> 00:39:34,840
Avatared?

881
00:39:34,840 --> 00:39:35,840
No.

882
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:36,840
Close.

883
00:39:36,840 --> 00:39:37,840
Okay.

884
00:39:37,840 --> 00:39:38,840
Avata-er.

885
00:39:38,840 --> 00:39:40,840
With a tilde.

886
00:39:40,840 --> 00:39:43,840
Isn't that what they do in the Navi language anyway?

887
00:39:43,840 --> 00:39:45,840
No, that's an apostrophe.

888
00:39:45,840 --> 00:39:46,840
Oh, wait.

889
00:39:46,840 --> 00:39:47,840
Do they do a different...

890
00:39:47,840 --> 00:39:48,840
The tar...

891
00:39:48,840 --> 00:39:49,840
The tar has this.

892
00:39:49,840 --> 00:39:50,840
Oh, I don't know.

893
00:39:50,840 --> 00:39:53,840
Did Mad Magazine make a spoof that was avatar-ed?

894
00:39:53,840 --> 00:39:54,840
Probably.

895
00:39:54,840 --> 00:39:55,840
Probably.

896
00:39:55,840 --> 00:39:56,840
Either that or I did.

897
00:39:56,840 --> 00:40:00,200
I think that I had that one.

898
00:40:00,200 --> 00:40:03,760
Yeah, what's this? Yeah, it's Tar. It's not Tar.

899
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:08,200
That's Tar right there. Who's that bitch? Who is this? She looks like fucking poop.

900
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:11,560
Oh my god, wait, he just made Avatar.

901
00:40:11,560 --> 00:40:14,760
Holy crap. Is that even Tar? Yeah, that's Tar.

902
00:40:14,760 --> 00:40:19,200
That's Tar from Tar. Oh yeah, that is Tar. Is her name Tar? Yeah, Lydia Tar.

903
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:22,880
I'm sick of talking about this movie. I don't know why we're talking about it.

904
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:25,600
- Did you talk about anything else with this fucking movie?

905
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:28,180

00:40:28,180 --> 00:40:29,800

916
00:40:44,380 --> 00:40:46,500
and I was like, this looks like fucking shit.

917
00:40:46,500 --> 00:40:48,260
- Why did you say you didn't wanna talk about Tartan

918
00:40:48,260 --> 00:40:49,780
and we're talking about just other movies?

919
00:40:49,780 --> 00:40:50,860

920
00:40:50,860 --> 00:40:51,700

949
00:41:36,520 --> 00:41:38,880
(laughter)

950
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:41,880

I've been watching a lot of old Johnny Carson.

960
00:42:02,280 --> 00:42:04,760
I didn't realize he did that shit into the 90s.

961
00:42:04,760 --> 00:42:06,120
I always thought it stopped in the 80s.

962
00:42:06,120 --> 00:42:08,200
He had like Drew Carey on there.

963
00:42:08,200 --> 00:42:09,040

- Yeah, yeah, he was the standup guest.

967
00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:14,640
He can barely talk.

00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:16,080
- Yeah, dude, Fuller got me.

969
00:42:16,080 --> 00:42:18,680
- Do you think we could do a Whose Line Is It Anyway reboot?

970
00:42:18,680 --> 00:42:19,520
Do you think that we might be able to do it?

971

I don't like them. He's like "okay three two one" he's also great because he's mean to

1003
00:44:44,740 --> 00:44:48,460
the people who need to be mean to him. Yeah he's pretty good at that.

1004
00:44:48,460 --> 00:44:51,900
There's that one clip where he gets in a... I've been distracted by all of them.

1005
00:44:51,900 --> 00:44:55,700
Yeah you gotta turn this off. I forgot he like gets in his

1006
00:44:55,700 --> 00:44:59,700
brothers fucking with him and then he gets in trouble for retaliating and that

1007
00:44:59,700 --> 00:45:04,340
pissed me off so much when I was a kid. Sorry but Joe Rogan's good at fear factor.

1008
00:45:04,340 --> 00:45:09,540
don't act like I'm saying the uninteresting no no I go ahead but Joe

1009
00:45:09,540 --> 00:45:14,000
Rogan's on fear factor sorry I was just watching home alone in the middle of the

1010
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:19,180
podcast why you got a photo of me up now now you're gonna look at this like it's

1011
00:45:19,180 --> 00:45:24,820
a movie - that's probably that's like one of the fattest I've ever been mm-hmm

1012
00:45:24,820 --> 00:45:29,700
yeah remember that photo I remember that photo I remember taking it mm-hmm when

1013
00:45:29,700 --> 00:45:32,100
so have a nice life

1014
00:45:32,100 --> 00:45:35,180
good times that episode of fear factor was it wasn't there

1015
00:45:35,180 --> 00:45:35,900
he wasn't there

1016
00:45:35,900 --> 00:45:39,980
was an all-time retail for and every time i was here for a job every single time

1017
00:45:39,980 --> 00:45:42,020
that no matter what i always

1018
00:45:42,020 --> 00:45:45,180
make the same joke every time it's to get to get to me every time is

1019
00:45:45,180 --> 00:45:49,820
who's fears this is a great of doing this and that was the three-fifth

1020
00:45:49,820 --> 00:45:51,780
three-fifth and that work

1021
00:45:51,780 --> 00:45:55,700
going underwater to turn up a metal handle

1022
00:45:55,700 --> 00:46:00,540
sticking ahead in animal walkers to pick up a a cow's tongue i fear and

1023
00:46:00,540 --> 00:46:05,160
yeah i think it's hard for a couple of people to another car

1024
00:46:05,160 --> 00:46:06,260
the way i was there

1025
00:46:06,260 --> 00:46:11,180
here there those are the three fears of driving a car that everybody's

1026
00:46:11,180 --> 00:46:12,340
so nobody won

1027
00:46:12,340 --> 00:46:13,300
so the end is like

1028
00:46:13,300 --> 00:46:15,860
i guess everyone's to a friend

1029
00:46:15,860 --> 00:46:18,860
that is so funny when you do doing stuntman work

1030
00:46:18,860 --> 00:46:22,540
and they're like well you clearly missed messed up because you were too afraid

1031
00:46:22,540 --> 00:46:42,260
for

1032
00:46:42,260 --> 00:46:46,040
truck while you're driving on a highway. Yeah I've never driven a car. I haven't either.

1033
00:46:46,040 --> 00:46:51,980
But you at least have some logical... I've driven a car. You can understand... I guess I have to see what this looks like.

1034
00:46:51,980 --> 00:46:55,340
Because you're not doing a good job explaining it. How can it be more clear?

1035
00:46:55,340 --> 00:46:58,660
There's two cars one has a ramp on the back and you have to drive on to the

1036
00:46:58,660 --> 00:47:03,860
ramp car. It's actually a little more complicated than that. Well so the car...

1037
00:47:03,860 --> 00:47:09,200
Let's start with the base explanation and then we'll introduce more complicated stuff. So the car is going off of a ramp that is on

1038
00:47:09,200 --> 00:47:14,680
another car yes to just sit on top of it to just sit on that's just parking while

1039
00:47:14,680 --> 00:47:19,160
they're driving everything's driving on a highway driving there's like there's a

1040
00:47:19,160 --> 00:47:23,000
flatbed truck that you have to get on the way you get on it is you drive up a ramp

1041
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:28,080
that is all on top of a car that is also moving and you're you're just true you're

1042
00:47:28,080 --> 00:47:32,600
just you're just I could do this I could do this fear no you could not even pass

1043
00:47:32,600 --> 00:47:38,280
the Lord fear I could pass the Lord fear then the Lord fear you want a Mazda they

1044
00:47:38,280 --> 00:47:41,560
one two cars

1045
00:47:41,560 --> 00:47:46,080
was the best episode of the put my head with the best episode ever is it's

1046
00:47:46,080 --> 00:47:47,920
smelly animal art

1047
00:47:47,920 --> 00:47:51,160
yeah you look at the candle after you get in it waits so what you're going to

1048
00:47:51,160 --> 00:47:55,560
hold on a large is a business was it's also more complicated it's it's there's

1049
00:47:55,560 --> 00:47:57,740
a lot and then there was uh...

1050
00:47:57,740 --> 00:48:01,200
was a big part of it was some other disgusting substance and their it was

1051
00:48:01,200 --> 00:48:02,620
used as tongues

1052
00:48:02,620 --> 00:48:04,200
that's that was in the reboot

1053
00:48:04,200 --> 00:48:07,960
um they made him drink jizz donkey jizz oh yeah that's why they got canceled like a

1054
00:48:07,960 --> 00:48:11,720
dust boot of it too yeah and then and they made girls do it and the girls went

1055
00:48:11,720 --> 00:48:16,280
oh and then they they were watching it love drinking they were watching going

1056
00:48:16,280 --> 00:48:22,200
like oh yeah you like that dude it was so i think rogan talked about it on some

1057
00:48:22,200 --> 00:48:25,440
episode where he talked about that specific incident and i don't remember

1058
00:48:25,440 --> 00:48:32,720
who the guest was but the guest was like yeah did you think it was hot donkey come

1059
00:48:32,720 --> 00:48:35,360
at while I'm at work and then they kept cutting to the donkey.

1060
00:48:35,360 --> 00:48:41,280
She would be drinking the jizz and going like "fwaaarrr" and they would just cut to its face.

1061
00:48:41,280 --> 00:48:44,880
The donkey had like, they went in the like liquify and photoshop and made its eyebrows

1062
00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:47,880
like "fwaaarrr" You know that thing where they do, they like

1063
00:48:47,880 --> 00:48:51,400
cut to an animal and they like, the ADR and the animal noise, like the dog going like

1064
00:48:51,400 --> 00:48:53,520
"fwaaarrr" They were like doing that but with the donkey.

1065
00:48:53,520 --> 00:48:57,000
I would have gone all out, I would have the donkey like looking back and just like, I'd

1066
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:58,520
fart in a ways it was shit.

1067
00:48:58,520 --> 00:49:02,000
They basically, they went as far as they could, then they got cancelled.

1068
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:08,400
they ruined everything. Speaking of animal jizz. We need to do a fear factor episode.

1069
00:49:08,400 --> 00:49:13,640
That's a great fucking idea. This is, I mean, the caution tape, I mean, we can even reuse

1070
00:49:13,640 --> 00:49:20,640
the set and do a cash cab one as well. Red and, or, red, white and, no, yellow and black.

1071
00:49:20,640 --> 00:49:26,760
Hey, nowadays a cab can be any color, thanks to Uber.

1072
00:49:26,760 --> 00:49:31,440
Whoa, that is true. But we could do a cash cab slash fear factor, we could divide it right

1073
00:49:31,440 --> 00:49:35,440
the middle yeah you can be on this side you could be the guy from cash cab and

1074
00:49:35,440 --> 00:49:41,880
Joe Rogan you can be Joe Rogan and I'll be the contestant because I look the most like the contestant

1075
00:49:41,880 --> 00:49:45,760
you yeah you don't look like Joe Rogan or anything no or the other guy from cash

1076
00:49:45,760 --> 00:49:51,800

No, I want to ask it.

1095
00:50:58,880 --> 00:50:59,880
Then I can ask.

1096
00:50:59,880 --> 00:51:00,880
I'm going to ask it.

1097
00:51:00,880 --> 00:51:01,880
Well, I'm the host.

1098
00:51:01,880 --> 00:51:02,880
Well, you just said I could ask it already, so I'm going to ask it.

1099
00:51:02,880 --> 00:51:03,880
Okay, I said it.

1100
00:51:03,880 --> 00:51:04,880
Alright.

Both of these nuts.

1105
00:51:10,800 --> 00:51:11,800
That's not...

1106
00:51:11,800 --> 00:51:17,000
They would never ask that in a trivia game.

1107
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:18,000
That makes no sense.

1108
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:19,000
Okay.

1109
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:26,000
I messed up the question. Next question. Which country does Fondalma come from?

1110
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:33,640
Popular cheese in what country does Fondalma come from? It's not a bad

1115

Jesus Christ say a saviorship damn you know on religion a cult classic that's

1121
00:52:57,280 --> 00:53:01,360

1122
00:53:01,360 --> 00:53:07,960
okay atheistic thinking mm-hmm listen I'll say this I left to be agnostic

1123
00:53:07,960 --> 00:53:11,980
atheist I left being a little to gate the is for Christmas I came back and I saw

1124

many a multitude of miracles yeah I would say here's I did you just gave me a

1125
00:53:15,920 --> 00:53:20,040
really good idea to convert atheists okay I'll be going door-to-door as a

1126
00:53:20,040 --> 00:53:28,240
missionary knock on the door say so pretend you're an atheist yes hello sir

1127

hello sir have you ever have you ever heard of Jesus's Jesus is your Savior oh

1128
00:53:35,760 --> 00:53:40,880
Oh that's good. So it weaponizes the bofa technique. Man, whatever happened to

1129
00:53:40,880 --> 00:53:47,080
magicianaries? You would go and they'd say, "Is this your Bible?" Remember they had a

1130
00:53:47,080 --> 00:53:52,240
they would have like a guy come to the school and shoot three-pointers to teach

1131
00:53:52,240 --> 00:53:55,360
you that like bullying is wrong but then he would be like, "I also got a show

1132
00:53:55,360 --> 00:54:01,080
tomorrow night at church." And it was just like, "Oh yeah." You think everybody's had this guy?

1133
00:54:01,080 --> 00:54:04,760
They always had a guy come to the school. I had guys come to my school but

1134
00:54:04,760 --> 00:54:09,020
not that guy to shoot they would they would have a guy going to church I was

1135
00:54:09,020 --> 00:54:14,060
they would have a guy come to the school and they he would do like be a you would

1136
00:54:14,060 --> 00:54:19,360
jump over something on a BMX bike in the gym now you're doing a different you

1137
00:54:19,360 --> 00:54:22,340
said there was three four different things that happened they had

1138
00:54:22,340 --> 00:54:26,580
motivational speakers like constantly at my school we didn't need motivation

1139
00:54:26,580 --> 00:54:30,440
because we were already self-motivated you were home skills not you guys always

1140
00:54:30,440 --> 00:54:35,540
say I was home to a buddy I went to fucking through sixth grade okay so I

1141
00:54:35,540 --> 00:54:39,720

00:54:39,720 --> 00:54:42,980
much they I used to go just hang out at my friend's school in high school cuz I

1143
00:54:42,980 --> 00:54:49,300
nothing they hired a guy to come to our middle school who was just his whole

1144
00:54:49,300 --> 00:54:53,440
thing was just being good at three-pointers he was like 46 or

1145
00:54:53,440 --> 00:54:58,760
something he was telling us about like don't give up blah blah blah but somebody

1146
00:54:58,760 --> 00:55:02,340
zeroed in on his penis while he was doing that and they thought it looked like he

1147
00:55:02,340 --> 00:55:06,980
had a boner so then everyone just kept calling him boner Bob boner Bob the

1148

Yeah and nobody heard about it. It's one of those things where like you he says

1153

one of those I'm like he made this up. No nobody told nobody didn't tell anybody.

1154
00:55:36,240 --> 00:55:41,000
The guy in the Taliban. He wanted to be in the Taliban. He was a wannabe. He was a wanksta.

1155
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:45,740
He said I read the I read the article. He was he was a wannabe gangster. He was a

1156
00:55:45,740 --> 00:55:50,440
complete wanksta. I read the article and it said it said according to the according to

1157
00:55:50,440 --> 00:55:57,440
the

1158
00:55:57,440 --> 00:56:02,920
Yeah, that's good. According to the perpetrator before he attacked the police officers with the machete

1159
00:56:02,920 --> 00:56:06,020
He took a sip of water and he shouted al-hu Akbar

1160
00:56:06,020 --> 00:56:10,140
But I didn't know why they said that he took a sip of water cuz water

1161
00:56:10,140 --> 00:56:13,840
Probably it was probably holy water. Oh

1162
00:56:13,840 --> 00:56:16,400
I don't know

1163
00:56:16,400 --> 00:56:23,000
We should do so he did he kill anybody? No, but he hurt some fractured. Well, so yeah, I fractured

1164
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:26,240
You know, we should know we should go blow up the entire Middle East now

1165
00:56:26,240 --> 00:56:28,960
know. Let's go do that.

1166
00:56:28,960 --> 00:56:33,360
You know what else is funny about that article? It said at the very beginning of it, they said

1167
00:56:33,360 --> 00:56:37,440
we caught him and we think it's just a lone individual. There's nothing to be worried

1168
00:56:37,440 --> 00:56:39,760
about. And this was at 10pm on New Year's Eve.

1169
00:56:39,760 --> 00:56:40,760
Wow.

1170
00:56:40,760 --> 00:56:44,120
When this happened. They shot him in the shoulder and they took him away.

1171
00:56:44,120 --> 00:56:45,440
They're popping shots in Times Square?

1172
00:56:45,440 --> 00:56:46,440
Yeah.

1173
00:56:46,440 --> 00:56:47,440
At New Year's?

1174
00:56:47,440 --> 00:56:48,440
At 10pm.

1175
00:56:48,440 --> 00:56:49,440
Holy shit.

1176
00:56:49,440 --> 00:56:50,440
And people didn't even know he was there.

1177
00:56:50,440 --> 00:56:53,160
And on New Year's they were like, guys this is a lone, don't worry about it, it's completely

1178
00:56:53,160 --> 00:56:55,920
you can still party for new year's eve don't worry about it and they didn't

1179
00:56:55,920 --> 00:56:59,560
tell it they'd and then at the bottom of the article it says and this attack

1180
00:56:59,560 --> 00:57:03,440
lines up with uh... with a lot of police officers that believe that there's going

1181
00:57:03,440 --> 00:57:05,760
to be an attack on the

1182
00:57:05,760 --> 00:57:08,400
from the telepathic

1183
00:57:08,400 --> 00:57:10,320

01:00:41,300 --> 01:00:46,340
end. And I don't like to say this often but this that lady she's pretty loose

1242
01:00:46,340 --> 01:00:54,900
that's pretty... She's probably a hoe. Kind of a hoe slut. Yeah. Yeah that's a bit of a loose thing.

1243
01:00:54,900 --> 01:00:59,740
Hey, don't you dare call that woman a slut. Listen I know that that's rude to say that about

1244
01:00:59,740 --> 01:01:04,260
somebody but that is just a little bit... What the hell? You think that that woman who...

1245
01:01:04,260 --> 01:01:05,860
500 guys in eight hours.

1246
01:01:05,860 --> 01:01:09,060
The lady who fucked 500 guys, you think that lady's a slut?

1247
01:01:09,060 --> 01:01:09,860
She's just a little--

1248
01:01:09,860 --> 01:01:10,660
She's a human being.

1249
01:01:10,660 --> 01:01:11,360
OK, I'll say this.

1250
01:01:11,360 --> 01:01:13,460
She seems a little promiscuous.

1251
01:01:13,460 --> 01:01:14,060
OK.

1252
01:01:14,060 --> 01:01:14,860
She gets around.

1253
01:01:14,860 --> 01:01:15,860
I could give you that.

1254
01:01:15,860 --> 01:01:16,660
I've heard.

1255
01:01:16,660 --> 01:01:17,460
Is that OK to say?

1256
01:01:17,460 --> 01:01:19,460
What the hell are you saying?

1257
01:01:19,460 --> 01:01:21,160
But she's the best slut in the world.

1258
01:01:21,160 --> 01:01:22,060
Yeah.

1259
01:01:22,060 --> 01:01:23,660
World record holding slut.

1260
01:01:23,660 --> 01:01:25,260
I guess if you are the world record--

1261
01:01:25,260 --> 01:01:27,060
Or the sluttiest slut, at least.

1262
01:01:27,060 --> 01:01:27,760
True.

1263
01:01:27,760 --> 01:01:31,260
You get the sash that says, world's biggest hoe.

1264
01:01:31,260 --> 01:01:32,060
You get that gash.

1265
01:01:32,060 --> 01:01:33,060
You know what my mama--

1266
01:01:33,060 --> 01:01:33,860
World's biggest gash.

1267
01:01:33,860 --> 01:01:35,860
You know what my mama said? Whatever you do, be the best at it.

1268
01:01:35,860 --> 01:01:39,860
And if you decide, I'm gonna be a fucking no good dirty whore.

1269
01:01:39,860 --> 01:01:41,860
I'm gonna be the best there is at that.

1270
01:01:41,860 --> 01:01:51,860
I just like, I guess like, the prospect of having like a world record is fun in a way.

1271
01:01:51,860 --> 01:01:52,860
It's so exciting.

1272
01:01:52,860 --> 01:01:53,860
I think it's exciting.

1273
01:01:53,860 --> 01:01:55,860
It costs like $2000 basically.

1274
01:01:55,860 --> 01:02:01,860
The smell of that room, after a while your legs are gonna hurt.

1275
01:02:01,860 --> 01:02:04,460
Like what you're not getting fucked. All right. No, no

1276
01:02:04,460 --> 01:02:07,940
Lady's perspective. It's just like why

1277
01:02:07,940 --> 01:02:12,120
You probably wanted to do it. She liked it

1278
01:02:12,120 --> 01:02:18,740
Maybe why did she want to do it? She got famous. That's true. It's so awesome. She got 506. Yeah

1279
01:02:18,740 --> 01:02:26,160
I'm happy with one. Yeah, I get half of one. I'm happy. So if I fuck imagine how many babies she had after that though

1280
01:02:27,180 --> 01:02:29,420
the group is a sort of the like or or or

1281
01:02:29,420 --> 01:02:31,280
there's so many babies in here

1282
01:02:31,280 --> 01:02:34,860
many many abortion she got all the news reports are

1283
01:02:34,860 --> 01:02:36,420
she which is a porn star

1284
01:02:36,420 --> 01:02:37,860
i think so

1285
01:02:37,860 --> 01:02:39,420
i was just a little while

1286
01:02:39,420 --> 01:02:40,140
that's

1287
01:02:40,140 --> 01:02:44,300
that this is not a good i thought it was a normal girl yet she was not a

1288
01:02:44,300 --> 01:02:45,820
citizen

1289
01:02:45,820 --> 01:02:46,620
he did

1290
01:02:46,620 --> 01:02:49,700
you're just a point one issue like i thought it was a little more

1291
01:02:49,700 --> 01:02:52,020
the

1292
01:02:52,020 --> 01:02:53,660
this is outrageous

1293
01:02:53,660 --> 01:02:56,460
I thought you were just like a normal girl who lives in an apartment building.

1294
01:02:56,460 --> 01:02:57,460
She's a porn star?

1295
01:02:57,460 --> 01:02:58,460
Isn't that awful?

1296
01:02:58,460 --> 01:02:59,460
What the fuck?

1297
01:02:59,460 --> 01:03:00,460
You know what?

1298
01:03:00,460 --> 01:03:01,460
And even then, what?

1299
01:03:01,460 --> 01:03:06,760
Oh, oh, you don't give, like, okay, she's a porn star, she's getting fucked by 500 guys.

1300
01:03:06,760 --> 01:03:12,700
You don't give a record to a fucking McDonald's employee for flipping 500 burgers in a day?

1301
01:03:12,700 --> 01:03:13,700
That's the thing.

1302
01:03:13,700 --> 01:03:16,580
That's so funny, I really, when you said she's a porn star, I really was like, what?

1303
01:03:16,580 --> 01:03:18,860
She's a porn star.

1304
01:03:18,860 --> 01:03:21,980
You know, when I first saw that video of her fucking 500 guys, I said, oh my god, I'm in

1305
01:03:21,980 --> 01:03:22,980
love.

1306
01:03:22,980 --> 01:03:40,020
on

1307
01:03:40,020 --> 01:03:43,020
fifty guys on any given day. I don't know how it works.

1308
01:03:43,020 --> 01:03:44,340
It's five hundred...

1309
01:03:44,340 --> 01:03:47,460
It should be disqualified from the record!

1310
01:03:47,460 --> 01:03:50,020
It should be Olympics!

1311
01:03:50,020 --> 01:03:57,020
Biggest gangbang for a normal girl!

1312
01:03:57,020 --> 01:04:00,860
That's a great idea. It should be like the Olympics. You can't be professional in

1313
01:04:00,860 --> 01:04:04,000
the sport to go for the gold.

1314
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:05,140
