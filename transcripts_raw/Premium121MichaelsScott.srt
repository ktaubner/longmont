That's what he would say when he had the chair on the subway.

64
00:02:47,460 --> 00:02:51,080
I did think about putting it in the middle or like the top of the train and

65
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:54,800
then just like sitting in it and just waiting for me to like slide down the

just gaslight Caleb into thinking he got fat no it's it's fine I guess there is

84
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:33,720
genuinely it genuinely made me feel bad like two episodes ago when I did say

85
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:38,880
that I made a joke. There's not a lot that's funnier than calling someone who's not fat

86
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:43,320
at all a fat ass though. I know. It's really funny. I'm already bald man. I know. You don't

90
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:01,440

normal. Actually, you know what? We can go hit our head in the door frame right

120
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:02,840

123
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:12,840
There he goes. That had to hurt.

124
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:18,240
Oh, I didn't. So yeah, he couldn't hit it. He admits it too short. No, no,

125
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:20,000
- Couldn't hit it on the three foot door.

126
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:20,840
- I didn't hit it, I jumped at the end too.

127
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:23,240
- He literally just said he jumped and he didn't even hit it.

128
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:24,720
You literally said you didn't hit it though.

129
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:25,560
- I didn't act.

130
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:26,400
- You literally ran through the door

131
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:27,240
and you didn't hit it, right?

132
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:30,480
- Yep, well, Buster Keaton never hit his head on anything.

133
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:31,680
- That's not true.

134
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:33,200
- That's true.

135
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:34,760
- First whole thing that is he hit his head

136
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:35,720

137
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:36,560

138
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:37,400
- Yeah, that was like his day.

139
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:39,360
- Did he have like a late life CTE thing?

140
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:40,640
- You're thinking of a different guy.

141
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:43,240
- Buster Keaton, fun fact, he actually never fell over.

142
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:44,080
- Yeah.

143
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:44,920
(laughing)

144
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:45,740
- He couldn't medically.

145
00:07:45,740 --> 00:07:49,760
was like a slapstick guy, but he actually never did any pranks or stunts. I was

146
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:53,180
thinking about this the other day or I was doing it's like those movie quotes

147
00:07:53,180 --> 00:07:57,480
that don't weren't actually in the movie. Yeah exactly. That's like my wife. Yeah exactly. He never

148
00:07:57,480 --> 00:08:01,360
actually he never actually did anything funny. No. Yeah he just stood there. The

149
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:05,660
Stooges actually. You're thinking of Charlie Chaplin. Uh-huh. I was laughing. Me and Alex

150
00:08:05,660 --> 00:08:09,260
were doing this bit the other day where it's like a like an American guy it's

151
00:08:09,260 --> 00:08:14,740
like yeah no I only like Buster Keaton none of that gay Charlie Chaplin shit.

152
00:08:14,740 --> 00:08:19,060
yeah Charlie Chaplin is way gayer than Buster Keaton. No I know but just like

153
00:08:19,060 --> 00:08:22,940
that like I'm just saying that person like football versus soccer thing where

154
00:08:22,940 --> 00:08:29,260
it's like yeah yeah it's called soccer bud it's like yeah no that gay crap like

155
00:08:29,260 --> 00:08:34,180
Charlie Chaplin. Yeah I'm saying I agree with that person. Charlie Chaplin

156
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:39,220
nothing gay he had the Hitler thing. Yeah yeah he had a very big Hitler

157
00:08:39,220 --> 00:08:43,020
mustache and a child. It's funny that he had the

158
00:08:43,020 --> 00:08:45,820
a Hitler mustache and then he's like I guess I have to do a movie where I'm

159
00:08:45,820 --> 00:08:46,660
Hitler. He had a

160
00:08:46,660 --> 00:08:54,980
when Hitler was like this is his speech at the end of that movie. Yeah, but I

161
00:08:54,980 --> 00:08:59,220
actually yeah, maybe Hitler will be at the end. Hitler's going to turn good.

162
00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:03,100
That's a great movie to make when Hitler's like oh great yeah. I have a

163
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:06,860
Hitler mustache. There's this evil guy named Hitler. Yeah, evil. I guess I have

164
00:09:06,860 --> 00:09:10,020
to make a movie where I'm him the whole time and at the end to make a beautiful

165
00:09:10,060 --> 00:09:17,060
speech as him and then put the inception soundtrack behind it. Remember that? I

166
00:09:17,060 --> 00:09:21,460
guess I have to play with a big beach ball in a movie dressed as the most evil

167
00:09:21,460 --> 00:09:27,640
guy in the world. Oh he fucked up. And then he shouldn't have grown that

168
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:31,580
mustache. I think you know what was it it's called like the toothbrush mustache.

169
00:09:31,580 --> 00:09:36,980
Do you think there could be do you think there could be a guy who is who is funny

170
00:09:36,980 --> 00:09:41,620
enough that he turns the Hitler mustache back into a funny mustache where people

171
00:09:41,620 --> 00:09:45,060
like kind of don't even think of it as Hitler yeah cuz like it was the funny

172
00:09:45,060 --> 00:09:48,820
Charlie Chaplin mustache right yeah I also I was thinking about this I feel

173
00:09:48,820 --> 00:09:53,140
like MJ tried I feel like if oh yeah Jordan had a Hitler mustache Hitler

174
00:09:53,140 --> 00:09:57,140
never had the Hitler mustache yeah that was I feel like that would nowadays

175
00:09:57,140 --> 00:10:00,300
would be like a hipster mustache like you'd see that and be like oh no oh

176
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:06,820
that's like a like a guy's gonna order yeah I know yeah a guy's gonna order like

177
00:10:06,820 --> 00:10:11,300
a latte with a bunch of sparkly pink stuff. I feel like that's the type of mustache that...

178
00:10:11,300 --> 00:10:14,580
So when he drinks his latte, it gets only on the Hitler part?

179
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:17,620
It gets on the side, so it completes the mustache with white.

180
00:10:17,620 --> 00:10:23,460
Wouldn't that suck? Would you get... Would you... Like, you receive $100, like genie

181
00:10:23,460 --> 00:10:27,460
situation, but every time that you drink milk...

182
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:29,860
Only $100? I already can tell $100 is not enough.

183
00:10:29,860 --> 00:10:34,260
That's not that crazy. You drink a milk or any kind of foamy drink or anything...

184
00:10:34,260 --> 00:10:37,500
- So any time you get it, you get $100.

185
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:40,300
- I feel like that's close to already what happens.

186
00:10:40,300 --> 00:10:41,340
- I kind of feel like that's--

187
00:10:41,340 --> 00:10:43,820
- I'd already done compensated for that.

188
00:10:43,820 --> 00:10:46,460
- On my mustache, these two parts right here.

189
00:10:46,460 --> 00:10:49,180
- That's cool.

190
00:10:49,180 --> 00:10:51,620
- If I do a pussy eating gesture,

191
00:10:51,620 --> 00:10:52,860
I do a pussy eating gesture,

192
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:55,340
it blocks every other part of it.

193
00:10:55,340 --> 00:10:58,380
So it looks like I just have a Hitler mustache.

194
00:10:58,380 --> 00:11:00,580
- So I think I would take that deal for $100

195
00:11:00,580 --> 00:11:03,660
unless there was any way for anyone to tell

196
00:11:03,660 --> 00:11:07,660
that I took it. If I could pretend it was an accident or like a

197
00:11:07,660 --> 00:11:09,060
coincidence every time.

198
00:11:09,060 --> 00:11:12,660
If somebody playfully ribs you and says, "Oh, you look, you got a

199
00:11:12,660 --> 00:11:16,060
Hitler mustache." You have to give them a business card that

200
00:11:16,060 --> 00:11:20,160
explains everything like the Santa Claus.

201
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:22,660
Okay, yeah, I would not take it anymore.

202
00:11:22,660 --> 00:11:25,560
It has fine print on the back that explains, "I went to a G."

203
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:28,260
When they find out that I did it for only $100.

204
00:11:28,260 --> 00:11:32,460
$100 and now I always look like Hitler every time I have a latte.

205
00:11:32,460 --> 00:11:35,860
Do you get wait do you get one hundred dollars every time you hit your mustache head?

206
00:11:35,860 --> 00:11:36,860
Is it every drink?

207
00:11:36,860 --> 00:11:37,860
Fuck no.

208
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:38,860
It's just a curse.

209
00:11:38,860 --> 00:11:39,860
It's every drink or it's just lattes.

210
00:11:39,860 --> 00:11:40,860
You pay a hundred bucks or you get a hundred actually yeah you pay a hundred bucks you

211
00:11:40,860 --> 00:11:41,860
get a curse.

212
00:11:41,860 --> 00:11:42,860
Would you pay a hundred bucks to get a curse?

213
00:11:42,860 --> 00:11:43,860
Would I pay a hundred bucks to get a curse?

214
00:11:43,860 --> 00:11:44,860
I think you guys are not understanding how kind of straight and clean the lines are that

215
00:11:44,860 --> 00:11:45,860
this is going to create on your face.

216
00:11:45,860 --> 00:11:46,860
Yeah okay but yeah is it every drink that you drink?

217
00:11:46,860 --> 00:11:47,860
Anything like water?

218
00:11:47,860 --> 00:11:48,860
Anything that you drink?

219
00:11:48,860 --> 00:11:49,860
Anything that you drink?

220
00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:50,860
Anything that you drink?

221
00:11:50,860 --> 00:11:51,860
Anything that you drink?

222
00:11:51,860 --> 00:11:52,860
Anything that you drink?

223
00:11:52,860 --> 00:11:53,860
Anything that you drink?

224
00:11:53,860 --> 00:11:54,860
Anything that you drink?

225
00:11:54,860 --> 00:11:55,860
Anything that you drink?

226
00:11:55,860 --> 00:11:56,860
Anything that you drink?

227
00:11:56,860 --> 00:11:58,340
that this is gonna create on your face.

228
00:11:58,340 --> 00:12:00,580
- Okay, but yeah, is it every drink that you drink?

229
00:12:00,580 --> 00:12:01,900
- There's, yeah, anything that could stain--

230
00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:02,740
- Like water?

231
00:12:02,740 --> 00:12:04,300
- 'Cause you could just lick it off.

232
00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:07,200
- With water, you drink it, and water is normally clear,

233
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:09,740
but when it makes a black, perfect square.

234
00:12:09,740 --> 00:12:11,580
- So yeah, no.

235
00:12:11,580 --> 00:12:12,420
- Also, you--

236
00:12:12,420 --> 00:12:13,240
(laughing)

237
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:15,860
- No, you can't, and of course I already said no.

238
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:16,700
- And also, you get--

239
00:12:16,700 --> 00:12:17,540
- And also, you get--

240
00:12:17,540 --> 00:12:18,380
- And chromatolectra goes to your house.

241
00:12:18,380 --> 00:12:20,220
- While, if you have any liquid in your mouth,

242
00:12:20,220 --> 00:12:22,340
you just look exactly like Hitler.

243
00:12:22,340 --> 00:12:23,180
(laughing)

244
00:12:23,180 --> 00:12:24,020
And then you transform.

245
00:12:24,020 --> 00:12:26,540
- So this is a would you rather now, would you rather--

246
00:12:26,540 --> 00:12:32,380
really and it's really painful. Would you rather for $100 get this

247
00:12:32,380 --> 00:12:37,100
liquid thing or every time that there's a liquid in your mouth you

248
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:44,540
become Hitler? And you have his thoughts and but listen and his money. Okay.

249
00:12:44,540 --> 00:12:49,660
How much money does he have? And his girlfriend. Oh wow. She comes back to life?

250
00:12:49,660 --> 00:12:57,260
life. No, she's still you just have her bones. Yeah, yeah, Ava's bones. Okay, I'm

251
00:12:57,260 --> 00:13:00,940
still saying no. I think you're just adding stuff to make me say no. Also, you

252
00:13:00,940 --> 00:13:08,740
have an open wound that will never heal. Yeah, but a Lamborghini. But you get a

253
00:13:08,740 --> 00:13:14,060
lamp, but it has no wheels and it never can have wheels. It looks like Hitler. It

254
00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:19,060
looks like an Oscar Mayer Wienermobile type like perfect recreation of Hitler's

255
00:13:19,060 --> 00:13:22,660
head. Well yeah, would you okay, would you rather have a Scott Astroworld?

256
00:13:22,660 --> 00:13:28,540
Would you rather have to drive the Hitler mobile or a normal Lamborghini

257
00:13:28,540 --> 00:13:29,500
Hitler mobile?

258
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:37,340
Why? Because probably was it go fast? No. Yeah, I don't like fast cars.

259
00:13:37,340 --> 00:13:41,500
It's probably too dangerous. It's probably easier to park it. Yeah.

260
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:45,980
It's taller than it is like a smart car. Yeah, yeah, that's it. You're

261
00:13:45,980 --> 00:13:50,520
explaining to your neighbor yeah look look I don't you know it's a neighbor

262
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:54,940
who is a hundred dollars it was a hundred dollars and every time I drank a liquid

263
00:13:54,940 --> 00:13:58,580
I would turn into Hitler or I would get a Hitler mustache so but then he gave me

264
00:13:58,580 --> 00:14:01,980
the opportunity to either take a Hitler car or a Lamborghini and I decided on

265
00:14:01,980 --> 00:14:04,520
the Hitler car because it's easier to fit into a park plus nobody's gonna steal a

266
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:08,260
Hitler car they'll steal a Lamborghini however it does get vandalized quite a

267
00:14:08,260 --> 00:14:13,220
bit people try to fill but they're just like but I did I did let somebody fill

268
00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:17,360
in the mustache fill in the rest of the mustache and now it's the Tom Selleck

269
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:27,180
mobile looks exactly like him yeah oh man I do want to get a crazy car yeah

270
00:14:27,180 --> 00:14:35,260
yeah that's the next step after after after offices I did say oh we're going

271
00:14:35,260 --> 00:14:41,460
on tour we're going on a huge eight city tour go to swag poop calm check it out

272
00:14:41,460 --> 00:14:46,260
Slash shows. Are we doing more shows after? What's the deal with that? Why would we

273
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:50,980
talk about that right now? That's true. Why would we figure that out right now? To hint it and tease

274
00:14:50,980 --> 00:14:55,220
it to the audience. What are you talking about? We could be doing more shows, who knows? But we'll

275
00:14:55,220 --> 00:14:59,860
probably never do one again actually. I told somebody, oh yeah we're gonna be taking a van

276
00:14:59,860 --> 00:15:03,540
and they were, I think it was my brother, and he was like are you gonna wrap it in like a giant

277
00:15:03,540 --> 00:15:12,020
pot about listing I was like yes we should just fucking eat or like basically eat

278
00:15:12,020 --> 00:15:17,380
up the tour budget I mean and also we're every show has to pay a prize and then we

279
00:15:17,380 --> 00:15:23,260
have to get back and we have we have wrapped the entire car. Well if you pay the $15 insurance you can do whatever you want.

280
00:15:23,260 --> 00:15:27,220
No we have to do is take a picture of the car like when they take a picture to

281
00:15:27,220 --> 00:15:31,940
assess damage before you rent it just photoshop on the wrap and be like no I was already like that.

282
00:15:31,940 --> 00:15:37,640
I don't know you guys gave it to us like this. It's a good idea. Yeah, or we could get one of those u-hauls

283
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:42,280
That like has like a little we could put our own facts on the side exactly

284
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:46,840
What fat what fact would you put on the side of a new hoax about yourself know about yourself?

285
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:50,780
Cameron is taller than the other two members. That's a good fun fact

286
00:15:50,780 --> 00:16:00,340
Fact Patrick has wears a size 36. I went I would maybe I think that we could waste 36 waste 36 36 29 pants

287
00:16:00,340 --> 00:16:01,920
(laughing)

288
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:02,760
- Is that what you wear?

289
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:03,580
- Yeah.

290
00:16:03,580 --> 00:16:04,420
(laughing)

291
00:16:04,420 --> 00:16:05,260
- Wow.

292
00:16:05,260 --> 00:16:06,080
- That is the funniest side.

293
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:07,500
- Dude, my legs are so short.

294
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:08,340
- That's so funny.

295
00:16:08,340 --> 00:16:09,380
- Look, I'm all torso.

296
00:16:09,380 --> 00:16:10,220
Look at me, dude.

297
00:16:10,220 --> 00:16:14,140
My fucking, like, my torso's longer than my legs.

298
00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:14,980
- Yeah.

299
00:16:14,980 --> 00:16:15,800
- I have to like--

300
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:16,640
- You're built like a longboard.

301
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:17,480
- I know, I gotta get--

302
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:18,900
- Yeah.

303
00:16:18,900 --> 00:16:20,900
- I gotta get like, 'cause like,

304
00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:23,340
the top half of my body is an extra large,

305
00:16:23,340 --> 00:16:25,420
but then the length is a large.

306
00:16:25,420 --> 00:16:26,260
- Mm-hmm.

307
00:16:26,260 --> 00:16:27,660
- I gotta get like, I gotta start getting my shirt,

308
00:16:27,660 --> 00:16:29,060
my T-shirts tailored.

309
00:16:29,060 --> 00:16:31,940
I don't think you need to put any more money into your t-shirts.

310
00:16:31,940 --> 00:16:32,940
It's true, personally.

311
00:16:32,940 --> 00:16:35,380
Yeah, I think getting your t-shirts tailored is like crazy.

312
00:16:35,380 --> 00:16:36,380
No, I think that I'm going to buy a set.

313
00:16:36,380 --> 00:16:37,380
He moves to New York, he starts giving specific...

314
00:16:37,380 --> 00:16:39,780
I think that's like psycho.

315
00:16:39,780 --> 00:16:42,980
I think that's maybe the first time I've ever heard somebody say that, like ever.

316
00:16:42,980 --> 00:16:43,980
I asked somebody...

317
00:16:43,980 --> 00:16:44,980
Who gets their t-shirts tailored?

318
00:16:44,980 --> 00:16:45,980
T-shirts tailored.

319
00:16:45,980 --> 00:16:46,980
Fucking Robert Downey Jr.

320
00:16:46,980 --> 00:16:49,500
I asked someone that was psycho, and they said that they have a friend who does it,

321
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:53,540
but it's only with like really like old vintage shirts.

322
00:16:53,540 --> 00:16:55,980
That like cost a lot of money.

323
00:16:55,980 --> 00:16:56,980
I'm mad.

324
00:16:56,980 --> 00:16:57,980
I'm angry.

325
00:16:57,980 --> 00:17:01,180
about getting t-shirts tailored t-shirts tailored it's a t-shirt.

326
00:17:01,180 --> 00:17:04,780
Yeah, let it be like baggy or tight or whatever get a different shirt.

327
00:17:04,780 --> 00:17:06,480
It's not yeah, it's not even for wearing.

328
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:09,980
Yeah, it doesn't what if you make it fit just right literally a t-shirt is

329
00:17:09,980 --> 00:17:13,580
better than a fucking is better than a white my bed your bathroom floor with

330
00:17:13,580 --> 00:17:17,580
and aware that T-pain one where he's like they got to start making half

331
00:17:17,580 --> 00:17:18,780
sizes or shirts.

332
00:17:18,780 --> 00:17:20,080
It's a good idea.

333
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:22,580
That was that is actually a pretty good idea, right?

334
00:17:22,580 --> 00:17:24,680
Good idea, but I don't think that excuse.

335
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:27,580
I don't think that means that you their solution is to get your t-shirts

336
00:17:27,580 --> 00:17:31,740
tailored. Well, you can do it yourself if you learn the medium. If you're doing it

337
00:17:31,740 --> 00:17:35,100
yourself, I would think that was cool. But if you take it to a place to get it done.

338
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:38,460
No, no, that's what I'm I want to get a sewing machine and start doing all my own

339
00:17:38,460 --> 00:17:45,980
shit. So I think I think that's what I'm gonna do here. Maybe this is gonna be

340
00:17:45,980 --> 00:17:49,660
your seamstress palace. Put a little like table somewhere with like a little

341
00:17:49,660 --> 00:17:54,620
sewing machine. We're not gonna budget space in our no pretty small office.

342
00:17:54,620 --> 00:17:57,740
forever. I know what here what's going to be here. There's nothing that's where

343
00:17:57,740 --> 00:18:02,140
you be is going to go. Oh true. Yeah. Yeah. Once we once I don't want I also I

344
00:18:02,140 --> 00:18:06,140
don't want a sewing machine in here regardless of space. Why it's going to

345
00:18:06,140 --> 00:18:08,980
be that you're working. You're just going to use a sewing machine. We need

346
00:18:08,980 --> 00:18:12,700
like a printer. We don't need a sewing. What if what if like you know like

347
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:16,500
you're like oh hey Patrick. I got a hole in my pants. Does it have a does it

351
00:18:28,980 --> 00:18:32,060
foot down again and I'm lifting my foot up again and then I put my foot down

352
00:18:32,060 --> 00:18:34,940
again because I am in on this sewing machine.

353
00:18:34,940 --> 00:18:40,540
All right, this is officially just this is the office planning session. This

354
00:18:40,540 --> 00:18:44,300
entire episode, yeah, we need to figure out is are we getting it? Are we going to

358
00:18:57,740 --> 00:19:02,380
dog sitting last night. I was dog sitting for Caleb. I was like I was like

359
00:19:02,380 --> 00:19:06,940
damn. I haven't fucked anything up yet. I went downstairs to get my food and

360
00:19:06,940 --> 00:19:11,900
then remembered that I forgot the keys. I did I paid Joe twenty dollars to go

361
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:16,580
to Adams house to get Caleb's keys. I purposely I purposely was like I asked

362
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:22,000
Patrick to dog six. I was like yeah, like Patrick, he's going to like spend time

363
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:22,620
with Phil.

364
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:27,000
I offered to do it because I knew that you had like a big night ahead of you.

365
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,500
I went out to have dinner. It was beautiful.

366
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:29,820
Yeah.

367
00:19:29,820 --> 00:19:30,260
But I was like...

368
00:19:30,260 --> 00:19:31,980
I know and I wanted you to have a nice time.

369
00:19:31,980 --> 00:19:34,300
It was very sweet. I'm glad you did it, but I was like...

370
00:19:34,300 --> 00:19:36,000
And I fucked it up immediately.

371
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,580
He showed up and Phil's a very easy dog.

372
00:19:38,580 --> 00:19:44,400
And I told him the two things that he has to remember for the dog and Pat was

373
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:46,380
like, can you write that down? I was like, oh, that's funny.

374
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:49,280
He's like three things. He was like, can you actually write that down and text it

375
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:54,440
to me? And it was like, put him in the crate. Would you leave? And then I was so

376
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:58,240
dude, I was so scared. I didn't want to like traumatize your dog somehow. And

377
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:01,720
then we get and then I fucking I get to dinner. I get a dinner. I put my coat

378
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:05,680
down, have two sips of the glass. It wasn't that it wasn't like that. It was

379
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:10,720
quick. Was it? It was less than an hour. I get a text from Pat. It's like, I'm

380
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:11,440
locked out of that.

381
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:18,400
I didn't know that. Oh, I'm so sorry. No, it was fine. I didn't really care, but

382
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:24,200
then I did and then I forgot. I told that I was like, do you have a do you

383
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:27,360
have like an old credit card or something? You try to Jimmy the door and

384
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:31,560
I'm on the phone with Pat and Pat's like does it have to be a credit card?

385
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:33,720
Can I use another

386
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:40,920
I forgot I had my old credit card. I hung up and I could not stop laughing

387
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,840
- But he was like, "Oh, it has to be a credit card."

388
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:44,040
(laughing)

389
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:45,800
- No, you know what, it has to be a credit card

390
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:48,400
'cause it has to loop, it's, a credit card is like,

391
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:49,920
I tried my ID and it didn't work,

392
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:52,120
but like the credit card was thin enough

393
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:54,840
that it could loop around and go on the latch.

394
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:56,420
- It doesn't have to be a credit card.

395
00:20:56,420 --> 00:20:57,400
- No, it does.

396
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:59,200
- I use a gift card when I have to get in there.

397
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:01,800
- Okay, well, a gift card, a gift card,

398
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:05,380
'cause I only, at the ready, I only had my,

399
00:21:05,380 --> 00:21:10,340
well, I didn't know that I had my old Bank of America card

400
00:21:10,340 --> 00:21:13,620
in my wallet, I only had my old IDs.

401
00:21:13,620 --> 00:21:15,220
- Does it have to be a credit card?

402
00:21:15,220 --> 00:21:18,700
- I only had my school IDs, my three school IDs

403
00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:20,780
from middle school, high school, and college.

404
00:21:20,780 --> 00:21:23,020
- Yeah, the one you used to get into the middle school.

405
00:21:23,020 --> 00:21:24,500
- Yeah, that's kind of weird that you keep

406
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:27,540
your middle school ID in your wallet as an adult, man.

407
00:21:27,540 --> 00:21:28,860
- No, I swear I'm a student here.

408
00:21:28,860 --> 00:21:31,120
- No, I have it on the, I have my wallet folds out,

409
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:34,640
so sometimes I'll show bartenders my high school ID.

410
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:35,900
It's funny to me.

411
00:21:35,900 --> 00:21:36,980
- They probably don't like it.

412
00:21:36,980 --> 00:21:37,820
- No, they don't.

413
00:21:37,820 --> 00:21:38,640
- They don't think it's that funny.

414
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:39,480
- They don't, but it's funny to me

415
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:40,900
- Yeah, all right, that's fair.

416
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:42,280
- Should I see your Vax Card and ID?

417
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:44,680
Yeah, here we go, Londonderry Middle School Storm,

418
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:48,440
Patrick Toren, class of 2015, baby.

419
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:51,120
- But yeah, it was just so funny that he just like--

420
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:52,880
- Yeah, you called me-- - Just immediately.

421
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:55,840
- You called me and I was like,

422
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:57,760
you like, 'cause Joe got there

423
00:21:57,760 --> 00:21:59,760
and then you guys FaceTimed to see if he got in

424
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:01,560
and I was just immediately like,

425
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:03,320
I did not wanna be on camera.

426
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:06,200
- His shoulders were, he was doing his Charlie Brown thing,

427
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:07,040
his shoulders were up.

428
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:09,840
He's like, "Hey, yeah, oh, you guys are- okay, cool."

429
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:11,840
And I'm like, "It's not that big of a deal."

430
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:13,840
I know, I just thought that like Phil would have-

431
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:14,480
Here's the best part.

432
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:16,800
I thought Phil would have pooped on the couch or something.

433
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:22,160
The reason he went outside was to get an Uber Eats that he ordered to get food,

434
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:23,120
and then I-

435
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:25,920
You guys said you would pay for it, and I was like, I was going to text you like-

436
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:26,960
There's no way now.

437
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:29,760
No, I know. I was going to text you guys like, "Do not pay for it."

438
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:34,400
But then also, I get upstairs when we like get home, and he like left the like

439
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:37,400
Uber Eats bag like in my house.

440
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:38,240
- Oh I did?

441
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:39,060
- Yes.

442
00:22:39,060 --> 00:22:39,900
- Oh dude.

443
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:43,560
- It's just like, he just like had to crush it in my house.

444
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:45,520
- No, I ate it on your stairs.

445
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:46,360
(laughing)

446
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:47,920
- I ate the whole thing on your stairs.

447
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:51,160
- Just imagining Patrick just sadly eating like pad thai

448
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:53,000
on my stairs while Phil is--

449
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:56,680
- I ate a whole thing of pineapple fried rice on his bed.

450
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:59,840
Dude, I was like, I was so terrified that like,

451
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:01,860
I would like go into your apartment

452
00:23:01,860 --> 00:23:04,860
and Phil would just be on the couch asleep.

453
00:23:04,860 --> 00:23:06,360
Or like, even worse.

454
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:08,320
- I was worried about him choking and dying on something,

455
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:09,400
but even then I was kinda like,

456
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:10,980
yeah, he's still like a dog.

457
00:23:10,980 --> 00:23:12,880
- That's the last thing on my fucking,

458
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:16,400
it's so funny seeing him in dog parent mode though.

459
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:17,720
'Cause as soon as I got there,

460
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:19,060
he's like walking around like,

461
00:23:19,060 --> 00:23:20,480
yeah, so this is his turtle.

462
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:22,720
(laughing)

463
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:24,640
- Dude, yeah.

464
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:25,880
- It's like, dude, literally like the same.

465
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:27,320
- I switch up, yeah.

466
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:30,360
- You have turned into me with my ex's cats, it's so funny.

467
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:31,720
No, it's easy dude.

468
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:32,240
Yeah.

469
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:32,240
Yeah.

470
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:36,080
He's like a, I mean, if you're taking pictures and sending it to us.

471
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:41,480
If you're like a stupid white guy, like a dog is just a baby to you.

472
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:41,960
Yeah.

473
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:42,840
No, a dog is a baby.

474
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:44,920
And I thought I was not susceptible to that.

475
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:46,520
It's not if you're any type of a dog.

476
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:50,560
I knew that this would happen to you as soon as you got a pet.

477
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:53,720
Because I've only ever had like, like growing up, I always had like outside

478
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:59,240
dogs that were like, you kind of just have them to like scare away outside

479
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:03,880
people you know what I mean and then you shadow man now I have like an indoor

480
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:09,280
like small dog yeah and he's no it happens to it's not it's it's nobody's

481
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:13,920
immune to yeah I mean it's literally exactly the same as having a kid yeah

482
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:19,040
like this is Phil is a great I'm a scientist and it's the same yeah I'm a

483
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:23,160
scientist the sign a dog is actually genetically identical to a human baby it

484
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:27,000
just doesn't grow that's the difference it's actually he's way smarter than a

485
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:31,160
baby no scientifically that's not possible you think you for babies like

486
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:34,240

492
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:59,200
when Fox News was on, he was watching Tucker.

493
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:00,640
He's like, "Dude, much respect."

494
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:01,880
Phil's getting--

495
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:02,720
- Phil's getting--

496
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:03,880
- Well indoctrinated. - Tucker killed, yeah.

497
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:04,720
- I love it, dude.

498
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:07,480
- Dude, I put it on, I literally was about to leave

499
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:10,000
and I put it on, and I just like, it was,

500
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,160
what was it, the shit with the nuclear reactor

501
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:14,840
was happening last night, and I looked at it.

502
00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:16,600
I turned it on and it was immediately like,

503
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:18,600
"Shots fired at a nuclear reactor."

504
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:20,680
And I went, "Oh my God, no!"

505
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:24,440
And I just sat down and watched it for like 10 minutes.

506
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:26,640
And then I was like, "Yeah, this is pretty much nothing."

507
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:31,640
The news is fucked up and evil. Did you guys ever think about that?

508
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:33,640
The media is actually...

509
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:35,640
But that's what we're supposed to learn where shit happens.

510
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:40,640
No, so it's actually, you'd think that, but actually the media is evil because...

511
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:43,640
What's great about these is they're only 3 ABV.

512
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:45,640
Yeah, these are like prank beers.

513
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:48,640
Whoa, you just sprayed all over my laptop.

514
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:51,640
That's why I don't like your fucking, give me like a paper towel or something.

515
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:53,640
I thought you were going to ask me to get you another beer.

516
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:55,640
Give me another beer so I can do it again.

517
00:25:55,640 --> 00:25:59,240
That's why I don't like your stupid ass one-handed shit.

518
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:00,240
It sprays everywhere.

519
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:02,120
I could open that like Kenny Powers, dude.

520
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:03,120
You're a piece of shit.

521
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:04,120
You just gotta be cool as a cucumber.

522
00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:05,120
Huh.

523
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:06,120
Me?

524
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:07,120
Yeah.

525
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:08,120
Look at me.

526
00:26:08,120 --> 00:26:09,120
I have to clean off my own computer after my friend ruined it.

527
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:10,120
It's probably broken.

528
00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:11,120
Oh, we need a butler.

529
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:12,120
We do need a butler really bad.

530
00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:15,920
You can put a client in the open case of my PC.

531
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:16,920
Okay.

532
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:18,480
Actually, please don't do that.

533
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:19,480
Alright.

534
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:20,480
Office checklist.

535
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:21,480
Uh-huh.

536
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:22,480
Butler?

537
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:23,480
Yeah.

538
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:29,600
willie what's a virtual roller coaster yeah oh one of those like flight

539
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:37,920
simulator like a pod racer okay it's every different type of arcade maybe

540
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:42,920
like a like a Jurassic Park game like a clone and also once we get tickets from

541
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:47,520
the games we're gonna need to use them like we're gonna need to have something

542
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:53,400
as we can get a ticket yeah yeah we can get atomic fireballs and the butler

543
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:55,480
- The butler can't, the butler won't know how to handle that.

544
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:56,320
- No, no, no, no, no.

545
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:57,140
- We'll need another employee.

546
00:26:57,140 --> 00:26:57,980
- The butler's not clean.

547
00:26:57,980 --> 00:26:58,820
- Yeah.

548
00:26:58,820 --> 00:27:00,980
- The butler, we don't want the butler anywhere near the

549
00:27:00,980 --> 00:27:01,820
tickets.

550
00:27:01,820 --> 00:27:05,180
- If we get another employee, that means that person could

551
00:27:05,180 --> 00:27:08,000
use the tickets, 'cause he's not the butler.

552
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,360
The butler is in his contract.

553
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:11,240
- No, nobody can use the tickets except us.

554
00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:12,080
- Yeah, we like earn the tickets.

555
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:15,340
- Because the games only work with Pot About List coins,

556
00:27:15,340 --> 00:27:17,900
which are a special kind of coin that only we have,

557
00:27:17,900 --> 00:27:19,140
and nobody else can get.

558
00:27:19,140 --> 00:27:19,980
So we need that.

559
00:27:19,980 --> 00:27:21,880
- If you try to put a normal coin in the machine,

560
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:23,480
it goes straight to our bank account.

561
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:24,640
- We need to get a claw machine.

562
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:25,960
We also need to get one of the ones

563
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:28,320
where you stack all the, that's so cool.

564
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:29,160
We have remote control lights.

565
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:30,440
- Yeah, we have a remote control light.

566
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:31,640
- It's fucking awesome.

567
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:35,000
It is seriously fucking cool.

568
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,440
It is fucking awesome.

569
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:38,000
It is fucking awesome.

570
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:41,720
- I really hope no one ever tries to find our office.

571
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:42,560
- Why?

572
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:43,600
- Actually, you know what? - 'Cause they'd be so jealous.

573
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:45,000
- They would, exactly. - Peering in.

574
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:45,840
Peering in like a--

575
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:46,660
- Actually, you know what?

576
00:27:46,660 --> 00:27:48,780
Come to our office, try it, look in the window

577
00:27:48,780 --> 00:27:50,360
and see how jealous you will be.

578
00:27:50,360 --> 00:27:53,280
Yeah, you'll be like an estranged father looking at Christmas.

579
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:56,400
You're going to be looking in the window like Charlie Bucket.

580
00:27:56,400 --> 00:28:00,640
You're like, "Oh, I wish I could get a Wonka candy, but my family's too damn poor because

581
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:01,640
my grandparents don't work."

582
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:02,640
That's right.

583
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:03,640
So I have another pitch for something.

584
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:07,960
Meanwhile, we're shooting a whole saloon game set up.

585
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:09,800
We're shooting bottles and balloons.

586
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:13,880
I have a pitch for another thing, another type of pod that I think we need to add in

587
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:16,760
here, which is like a cloning/birthing pod.

588
00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:20,120
we could maybe have an army of clones that could maybe help the butler.

589
00:28:20,120 --> 00:28:23,120
Where do we keep the clones at? We might not even get in our office.

590
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:26,280
No, we would just kill them at the end of the day and then clone new ones and we like come

591
00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:27,280
into the office in the morning.

592
00:28:27,280 --> 00:28:29,080
Do we have any sexual clones?

593
00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:31,080
Yeah, you'll get some sexual clones for sure.

594
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:36,760
We do need three water tanks that have like suspended vitro clones of us.

595
00:28:36,760 --> 00:28:41,840
Yeah, and we can just spawn them whenever we need them. They can do whatever. And then

596
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:46,120
we just kill them when we're done with them. And then we can like, you know, maybe we can

597
00:28:46,120 --> 00:28:51,160
feed their meat to visitors as a prank or we could burn them for heat. Good idea.

598
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:54,640
Yeah. Or we could use them to build tables and chairs. That's what we need. We need it we need an

599
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:59,440
open rib cage, disembodied rib cage in the middle of this table. Yeah. So it looks like

600
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:03,400
we're cannibals or something. We could make all the furniture out of bones. And

601
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:07,440
and skin. And skin. Yeah. But then we have to make the furniture. Well no the clones

602
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:11,120
will do it. We'll make some clones, kill the clones, and make some new clones and tell

603
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:14,640
the clones to use the clone skin and bone to make the clone of the furniture.

604
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:16,780
- It's clone, it's clone bone.

605
00:29:16,780 --> 00:29:17,620
- Okay.

606
00:29:17,620 --> 00:29:18,740
- It's clone bone, right?

607
00:29:18,740 --> 00:29:19,580
- Clone bone.

608
00:29:19,580 --> 00:29:22,260
- So it's clone bone, is that synthetic or is it like--

609
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:23,460
- No, it's clone-thetic.

610
00:29:23,460 --> 00:29:26,820
- We need a big red phone that goes directly to the mayor.

611
00:29:26,820 --> 00:29:27,660
- Yeah, the clone phone.

612
00:29:27,660 --> 00:29:28,480
- Yes!

613
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:30,420
- Oh, dude, I wanna talk to, what's that guy's name?

614
00:29:30,420 --> 00:29:31,380
Eric. - Eric Adams.

615
00:29:31,380 --> 00:29:32,220
- Yeah.

616
00:29:32,220 --> 00:29:33,060
- The brave--

617
00:29:33,060 --> 00:29:33,880
- I almost said Garcetti.

618
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:34,720
- The heroic--

619
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:35,560
- That's the LA guy.

620
00:29:35,560 --> 00:29:37,700
- Heroic NYPD officer, Eric Adams.

621
00:29:37,700 --> 00:29:38,740
- Fake vegan.

622
00:29:38,740 --> 00:29:40,260
- I didn't even know, it's funny that like--

623
00:29:40,260 --> 00:29:41,140
- He ate fish.

624
00:29:41,140 --> 00:29:43,260
- The mayor, I didn't even know that we had a new mayor

625
00:29:43,260 --> 00:29:44,140
until like a week ago.

626
00:29:44,140 --> 00:29:46,540

How about the Vizio the TV brand? Yeah, okay a Blasio?

631
00:30:01,700 --> 00:30:05,020
There's a big old big-ass bong

No, it's not you blaze. Oh, oh

633
00:30:08,900 --> 00:30:10,900

00:30:10,900 --> 00:30:12,540
- Eublasio some Potts.

635
00:30:12,540 --> 00:30:13,580

- With Bill.

637
00:30:14,420 --> 00:30:15,240

638
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:16,080
- Yep.

639
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:17,980
- Oh, that would be a perfect pair, Toe.

641
00:30:19,020 --> 00:30:20,380
- Dude, that would be perfect.

642
00:30:20,380 --> 00:30:22,220
- Yeah, excellent, one might say.

00:30:28,580 --> 00:30:29,420
- Don't put my--

00:30:49,940 --> 00:30:53,980
afraid I don't really want to fight in a prank war. Yeah. It's your duty. If I get

659
00:30:53,980 --> 00:30:59,220

660
00:30:59,220 --> 00:31:03,380

661
00:31:03,380 --> 00:31:07,380
hands on Jello I'm killing somebody. Everything that's bad for a normal war is

662
00:31:07,380 --> 00:31:12,240
was better for a prank war. It's true. Any kind of physical ailment. If you have a

663
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:16,080
limp, I'm too sad to fight. I can't fight in this prank war. That's true. That's

664
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:19,320
pranks are going to help you. It's going to cheer you up. No. When you make

665
00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:23,320
somebody pee, but it's what you're the hand in a hard water. He's got prank

666
00:31:23,320 --> 00:31:27,560
pression, dude. He can't. No, he does not. I do. I have prank pressure. I can't. I

667
00:31:27,560 --> 00:31:31,900

668
00:31:31,900 --> 00:31:35,780
right now. My just make him sad. Oh, this flower on my lapel. It's probably

669
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:37,000
nothing and you should get closer.

670
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:42,640
It's very interesting when you get real close to it and and my teeth my teeth

671
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:47,320
are my teeth always chatter. Is it does it just get cold in here? They always

672
00:31:47,320 --> 00:31:50,220
chatter. Oh, the crank on the side has been there forever. The wind up

673
00:31:50,220 --> 00:31:56,200
would you like a would you like an exploding bouncy snake? I mean peanut

674
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:57,020
peanut

675
00:31:57,020 --> 00:32:05,640
exploding. What would you call it? I guess a spring a springy springy springing

676
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:10,320
snake. Would you like a springing snake? Would you like a snake of mine that explodes in my

677
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:11,320
can?

678
00:32:11,320 --> 00:32:18,640
They should do that should be a yeah you roll like like Christmas in the in the the trenches

679
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:24,400
of fucking World War One. You just roll some some peanut brittle under the under the door

680
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:30,440
all of a sudden guess what this fucking Ukrainian piece of shit's getting in his face a serious

681
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:31,440
snake money shot.

682
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:32,440
An exploding bouncing snake.

683
00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:40,640
Exploding bouncing snake. Yeah. I can't wait till this office is completely filled out.

684
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:44,960
We also have to have obviously some porn on the walls. Yeah, definitely. You know. I should

685
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:50,480
do what my brother's friends did with their shed. Hardcore, softcore, mediumcore. My brother's

686
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:55,240
friends in their shed, they lined all the walls with like Maxim magazine spreads. Well

687
00:32:55,240 --> 00:33:00,800
like a bar bathroom. Why does every bar in New York City have fucking porn on them? Yeah.

688
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:06,080
jack off and you're talking well like five different bars okay yeah you were

689
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:11,240
talking about the one at Gordo's specific Gordo's has it Gordo's has just

690
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:17,080
like Mexican news pine box yeah pine box yeah they all just have fucking and all

691
00:33:17,080 --> 00:33:21,240
our listeners at home know I heard I heard well magazines and newspapers are

692
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:26,480
cheaper than than wall would yeah so it's easier to build a bathroom a

693
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:29,840
bathroom usually where you want to skimp yeah there's a bar like that I mean you

694
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:33,240
You build the whole restaurant and bar and you're like, "Okay, well we spent the whole budget

695
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:34,440
but we forgot the bathroom."

696
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:35,800
It's like, "Well, what do we have?

697
00:33:35,800 --> 00:33:36,800
Boxes and boxes of porn."

698
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:40,400
A bar in my hometown called the Juggling Gypsy used to have porn on the wall.

699
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:41,400
The Juggling Romani.

700
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:44,680
Well, now they changed it to, it's now called Bar Czar.

701
00:33:44,680 --> 00:33:45,680
Oh, really?

702
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:46,680
Yeah.

703
00:33:46,680 --> 00:33:47,680
Like, bizarre.

704
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:48,680
I mean, it's the worst place ever.

705
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:52,160
I've never seen a place that is bar czar.

706
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:56,760
We have to think of a name that won't offend anybody.

707
00:33:56,760 --> 00:33:57,760
Nobody can possibly get mad.

708
00:33:57,760 --> 00:33:58,760
A name so confusing.

709
00:33:58,760 --> 00:34:04,600
usually yeah it's supposed to be bizarre I guess no like it's a bizarre

710
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:12,600
stretch is B-A-R-Z-A-R-R-E. Makes no sense. What? Bizarre. That's funny too.

711
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:16,600
They could have just had it like bizarre. That's the first place I ever did

712
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:20,120
stand up and a lady a lady like was waiting for the open mic they have like

713
00:34:20,120 --> 00:34:23,240
a just a couch yeah and I was like sitting there and she's like you going

714
00:34:23,240 --> 00:34:26,920
up tonight I was like oh yeah she's like oh cool what do you do comedy yeah we

715
00:34:26,920 --> 00:34:34,440
just like talked and then a rat jumped on my head and I was like freaking out and

716
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:37,920
she was like oh no that's just my rat I was like why didn't you tell me there's

717
00:34:37,920 --> 00:34:42,240
a rat hidden in the couch when I fucking sat down cuz like yeah I do not

718
00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:47,960
automatically assume a rat is a pet yeah no and it was on my head yeah that's a

719
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:56,840
no-no that's a big faux pas that's just Sydney he's oh yeah that's my

720
00:34:56,840 --> 00:35:02,020
little husband it I mean say what you will about the place it truly is bars are

721
00:35:02,020 --> 00:35:07,280
it is funny that - that they're like well we can't call it we can't name it we

722
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:17,980
can't name it gypsy so what's something similar to that bizarre the weirdest bar

723
00:35:17,980 --> 00:35:21,120
ever it's fun at Wilmington I was such a like

724
00:35:21,120 --> 00:35:25,480
we're gonna bar rescued and we don't know that'd be cool bars are did bars are

725
00:35:25,480 --> 00:35:29,440
bar rescued bars are resources are rescued. Are you kidding me? They're

726
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:35,920
called Romani people. Now what are you doing? This is offensive. It's

727
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:41,240
horrible. You're losing business. You're losing customers. It's Wilmington has

728
00:35:41,240 --> 00:35:48,560
a weird vein of like fake shitty like goth stuff. Like we went to that

729
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:53,000
museum. Oh yeah. Museum of the bizarre. Of the bizarre. Yeah. Which is it

730
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:56,480
costs like five dollars to the serpent area. They just have a bunch of little

731
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:59,840
more for some special activity like there was the there was a

732
00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:05,400
game where we had to jump through the laser laser maze, the laser maze and the

733
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:06,760
mirror maze. They had two different

734
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:12,120
they fuckin yeah they have they advertise it is like oh there's there's

735
00:36:12,120 --> 00:36:16,300
freaky haunted shit in this museum and then you go in and it's a storage unit.

736
00:36:16,300 --> 00:36:21,360
Basically, that's filled with with like old props yeah like a spirit. Halloween

737
00:36:21,380 --> 00:36:25,460
Oh, yes, statues of like pinhead. It is statue of many me as such of many

738
00:36:25,460 --> 00:36:28,280
yeah, and they'll have like a napkin and it'll be like this napkin was signed by

739
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:31,960
Michael Myers. Yeah, just stuff that makes no sense and then you have to pay

740
00:36:31,960 --> 00:36:36,320
extra and then you can do a laser maze and a hall of mirrors. It's yeah, laser

741
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:39,780
maze a mirror. It's mazes bad ass. It was I mean, what's more we should get

742
00:36:39,780 --> 00:36:43,660
made some mazes in here that could be big. That's actually a good Halloween.

743
00:36:43,660 --> 00:36:48,780
Holy shit, or we could we could what if we have the world's very first Christmas

744
00:36:48,780 --> 00:36:49,300
maze

745
00:36:50,900 --> 00:36:56,180
okay. Christmas haunted hayride yeah, because I went Christmas, holly hayride

746
00:36:56,180 --> 00:37:00,900
holly jolly hayride, holly ride yeah, yeah, because I immediately for

747
00:37:00,900 --> 00:37:04,300
Halloween, because I was thinking like we like see that corner right there.

748
00:37:04,300 --> 00:37:09,360
So we line this, we could that will be a really good haunted house. This would

749
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:14,080
be a good two dollar haunted house. Yeah, you just you bring them down here,

750
00:37:14,080 --> 00:37:16,900
something to think about that. I'm going to file a

751
00:37:18,660 --> 00:37:21,000
haunted part of it is like we bring people down here.

752
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:22,760
- That'd be funny if we did a podcast

753
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:23,720
about Liz Haunted House.

754
00:37:23,720 --> 00:37:26,000
- We bring people down here and it's like,

755
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,360
yeah, this is what your life could look like.

756
00:37:28,360 --> 00:37:29,760
(laughing)

757
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:31,320
Yeah, you know?

758
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:34,160
- You could've fucked up real bad and been doing this now.

759
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:35,000
- Yeah.

760
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:35,820
- Now I think--

761
00:37:35,820 --> 00:37:36,880
- Not being able to walk down the street

762
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:38,640
'cause everyone thinks you got neutered.

763
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:39,920
- Yeah.

764
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:41,400
I think this would be a good idea

765
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:43,880
if we put all our shit away,

766
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:45,840
replace it with Halloween stuff,

767
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:48,200
and then we, or we do a day of haunted--

768
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:50,040
- We should rent a barn or something.

769
00:37:50,040 --> 00:37:51,120
- No, we do it today.

770
00:37:51,120 --> 00:37:53,320
- We should do it in the middle of the woods.

771
00:37:53,320 --> 00:37:55,560
(laughing)

772
00:37:55,560 --> 00:37:58,520
- If we just turn this whole thing into a haunted house,

773
00:37:58,520 --> 00:37:59,360
you're in.

774
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:00,440
- It'd be awesome, dude.

775
00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:03,600
- We made no money, but we're like losing

776
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:04,440
a shit ton of money.

777
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:06,400
- We're losing hundreds of dollars a month.

778
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:08,080
- Because we just wanna turn this like,

779
00:38:08,080 --> 00:38:09,960
I mean, it was the perfect, look, there's a door.

780
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:12,120
- At first we thought it was more of an office studio,

781
00:38:12,120 --> 00:38:13,840
but it's clearly a haunted house.

782
00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:15,320
- There's a tiny door right there

783
00:38:15,320 --> 00:38:17,080
that a man can jump out of.

784
00:38:17,080 --> 00:38:20,320
we have to have we'd have to have a little kind of like we have to have some kind

785
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:21,240
of like

786
00:38:21,240 --> 00:38:24,880
fail safe thing where we can really quickly make it look like not a haunted

787
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:27,280
house of the the landlord comes and not get it like

788
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:31,280
are you running off unlicensed haunted house out of the air we need to prepare

789
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:34,340
and you could be a little bit of some panels around the

790
00:38:34,340 --> 00:38:37,360
you know i'm sorry i don't know it's an all-star big empty office with

791
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:39,040
pumpkins

792
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:40,960
you know that you can't and you know

793
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:44,640
we let you know we like scary music that we can take a look at this this is a

794
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:52,140
It's my favorite song. We're having a high school dance in here. It's called

797
00:39:05,640 --> 00:39:08,200
It's really nice. I already love it. We haven't done anything. It's like my old

798
00:39:08,200 --> 00:39:11,680
apartment. It's the same layout of my old apartment in Boston. It's the same

799
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:16,680
color scheme yeah it's just shitty like like the cheapest remodel you can do yeah

800
00:39:16,680 --> 00:39:20,640

00:40:29,560 --> 00:40:33,720
want a ball pit jump into the ball pit we aren't okay are we gonna be doing

816
00:40:33,720 --> 00:40:39,960
I'm not kidding. We could get a bathtub and fill it with balls there.

817
00:40:39,960 --> 00:40:47,960
That's true. Like a claw putt. Yeah. I gotta relax.

818
00:40:47,960 --> 00:40:52,960
Or like, just jumping into the ball pit and just cracking your head open.

819
00:40:52,960 --> 00:41:01,960
Just like a porcelain. I feel like a mini ball pit is not a bad idea for that.

820
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:08,440
an inflatable pool filled with water. Okay, I'm fine with that. Water slide? Well, I do

821
00:41:08,440 --> 00:41:13,160
think it does go down. I did think we could do a slip and slide in here before we move

822
00:41:13,160 --> 00:41:18,400
everything in. Yeah. We do just one day. You mean everything out? No, before we move all

823
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:22,000
of our stuff in. My stuff's here. Well, yeah, but we'll start right here. Your stuff doesn't

824
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,920
matter. But then also we don't want to get water everywhere, so I was thinking olive

825
00:41:24,920 --> 00:41:32,300
oil or something yeah easier to clean up or just dry my my new dry yeah so we just

826
00:41:32,300 --> 00:41:36,060
get a bunch of sesame oil gross and then slide yeah someone left a bunch of

827
00:41:36,060 --> 00:41:39,920
sesame oil that's an expensive oil in the cabinets and they left a bunch of

828
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:44,000
sesame oil and a bunch of canned food why are people freaking out about seed

829
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:49,340
oil what's wrong with seed oil? I don't know. So what's the deal with seed oil nowadays?

830
00:41:49,340 --> 00:41:54,680
Joe Rogan said something about seed oil. It's his damn seed oil. What's up with the seed oil?

831
00:41:54,680 --> 00:42:01,360
went on really yeah is it gonna make me low-t is it made of oil or is it made of

832
00:42:01,360 --> 00:42:08,660
seeds what's the deal with oil in those what are they balloons how about we turn

833
00:42:08,660 --> 00:42:13,200
the seeds into butter peanut butter my name is George Washington Carver

Snowboarder

It's on the other side of the mountain of peanut butter and he's carving a Mount Rushmore with George Washington

839
00:42:54,900 --> 00:43:03,240
He's carving a Christmas ham

840
00:43:03,240 --> 00:43:15,480
He's driving a car

841
00:43:15,480 --> 00:43:16,980

843
00:43:18,860 --> 00:43:20,760
- George, Mike Fletcher's George.

844

(laughter)

845
00:43:22,580 --> 00:43:25,240
- Washington, that's a state.

846
00:43:25,240 --> 00:43:26,340
- Washington, what does that mean?

847
00:43:26,340 --> 00:43:27,500
He's washing something?

848
00:43:27,500 --> 00:43:29,140
- Yeah, he's washing his shirt a ton

849
00:43:29,140 --> 00:43:30,980
'cause he got so much peanut butter on it

850
00:43:30,980 --> 00:43:32,500
when he was trying to invent it.

851
00:43:32,500 --> 00:43:34,300
- And George-- - That just makes sense.

852
00:43:34,300 --> 00:43:37,220
- And George, what's that, an alien species?

853
00:43:37,220 --> 00:43:39,740
- I've never met anyone named George.

854
00:43:39,740 --> 00:43:42,700
- I don't know, Mike is going crazy.

855
00:43:42,700 --> 00:43:44,820
- I do know, yeah, he's George like the guy I know,

856
00:43:44,820 --> 00:43:49,020
that he's Washington like the president and then he's got your mic just turned

857
00:43:49,020 --> 00:43:51,980
off you just fucked up your mic with whatever you did what did I do I don't

858
00:43:51,980 --> 00:43:58,260
know you fucked it up. Can you hear me? The greatest bit we've ever done in the history of the podcast

859
00:43:58,260 --> 00:44:04,460
about Seinfeld doing something real wrong with his brain yeah and you

860
00:44:04,460 --> 00:44:08,740
destroyed it I think Seinfeld every time that Seinfeld is brought up on our show

861
00:44:08,740 --> 00:44:12,780
I try to resist but it's just too yeah I have to every once in a while I have to

862
00:44:12,780 --> 00:44:15,300
throw it I feel like I feel like sometimes I'll hear something like that

863
00:44:15,300 --> 00:44:19,100
and I just have to I I can't do the Seinfeld voice very well but I know that

864
00:44:19,100 --> 00:44:24,180
if I just throw one out there it's good I'm gonna rent set the sample doesn't

865
00:44:24,180 --> 00:44:32,540
even have a voice you just go people anything like that you watch comedians

866
00:44:32,540 --> 00:44:37,060
and cars getting coffee and he's like the thing about comedy is but it just he

867
00:44:37,060 --> 00:44:38,420
he doesn't sound anything like yeah.

868
00:44:38,420 --> 00:44:43,580
But I look through my jar of peanut butter. I looked through my text with my

869
00:44:43,580 --> 00:44:48,420
father the other day, 'cause me and Joe were comparing dad texts and just like

870
00:44:48,420 --> 00:44:51,420
how just like stupid. I'm gonna look at my dad's texts. When you text your dad,

871
00:44:51,420 --> 00:44:55,140
it's how dumb it is. Yeah. And it's like a joke, like why would you ever text

872
00:44:55,140 --> 00:44:58,660
your dad? You're never talking about anything important. And I texted... He

873
00:44:58,660 --> 00:45:02,300
texted me like two years ago, and he sent me a text that was like, it was

874
00:45:02,300 --> 00:45:05,780
like, "New Seinfeld special, he really missed the mark."

875
00:45:05,780 --> 00:45:13,700
I was like, okay, dad. Yeah, that is it. It's always what it's like. What do you

876
00:45:13,700 --> 00:45:17,180
think? I'm sitting there like having an opinion on the Seinfeld special. He has

877
00:45:17,180 --> 00:45:24,220
he knows that comedy like a three weeks ago now he asked me he asked me for

878
00:45:24,220 --> 00:45:29,140

892
00:46:25,900 --> 00:46:30,400

00:50:21,900 --> 00:50:24,340
in my phone and I was like, no.

952
00:50:24,340 --> 00:50:26,500

You put your brother's face on your penis.

Yeah, I want him to suck my dick.

961
00:50:41,100 --> 00:50:42,100

962
00:50:42,100 --> 00:50:43,100

963
00:50:43,100 --> 00:50:44,100

00:50:52,860 --> 00:50:54,420
They're like different versions of you.

971
00:50:54,420 --> 00:50:59,060
I want to fucking cum all up my brother's butt.

972
00:50:59,060 --> 00:51:00,700
Stop talking about fucking your brother.

973
00:51:00,700 --> 00:51:01,700
That's weird.

974
00:51:01,700 --> 00:51:03,100
I want to cum in their butts.

975
00:51:03,100 --> 00:51:04,500
he's actually winning me over.

976
00:51:04,500 --> 00:51:09,620
He's actually making some very cogent. I was against it before

977
00:51:09,620 --> 00:51:13,500
you're going to have to argue and really later when you get a call,

978
00:51:13,500 --> 00:51:16,780
we're white from from my you try to pay

979
00:51:16,780 --> 00:51:22,860
your wiener open up your credit card. I'm trying to see if I can pay my

980
00:51:22,860 --> 00:51:23,400
penis.

981
00:51:23,400 --> 00:51:25,500
Let me kind of

982
00:51:25,500 --> 00:51:31,300
that'd be funny if like somehow there was some just like like well,

983
00:51:31,340 --> 00:51:34,400
biological like electrical nerve signal that somehow just like it just

984
00:51:34,400 --> 00:51:36,140
deducts ten thousand dollars

985
00:51:36,140 --> 00:51:41,100
phone accident is gone for really hold it your phone up to where you got

986
00:51:41,100 --> 00:51:41,900
vaccinated and

987
00:51:41,900 --> 00:51:44,540
all your money

988
00:51:44,540 --> 00:51:50,340
paid for some like some freak static shots like completes the circuit.

989
00:51:50,340 --> 00:51:53,540
There's a charge on your bank account that just says like ten thousand

990
00:51:53,540 --> 00:51:54,260
dollars. Funko

991
00:51:54,260 --> 00:52:00,420
that's probably what it's for. It's probably that's why they were pushing

992
00:52:00,420 --> 00:52:04,420
contactless now and Apple Pay right before the vaccine.

993
00:52:04,420 --> 00:52:05,260
- Yeah.

994
00:52:05,260 --> 00:52:06,820
- And so you think you're paying the bodega guy,

995
00:52:06,820 --> 00:52:09,820
he's actually, he's not getting any money.

996
00:52:09,820 --> 00:52:13,720
And actually it's all going to who freaking knows where.

997
00:52:13,720 --> 00:52:17,260
Probably like Russia or China, yeah.

998
00:52:17,260 --> 00:52:18,100
- Yeah, probably it's gonna be China.

999
00:52:18,100 --> 00:52:21,220
- That's probably how Russia was able to get all the military

1000
00:52:21,220 --> 00:52:23,760
to attack Ukraine is probably they got all the money

1001
00:52:23,760 --> 00:52:26,580
from the bodega that I would spend every day

1002
00:52:26,580 --> 00:52:27,980
when I buy candy and toys.

1003
00:52:27,980 --> 00:52:31,780
I thought Russia, until like this week, I thought they were still living in like

1004
00:52:31,780 --> 00:52:34,480
chivalry, like they were still like walking around with swords.

1005
00:52:34,480 --> 00:52:34,980
Really?

1006
00:52:34,980 --> 00:52:35,980
They had great swords.

1007
00:52:35,980 --> 00:52:39,580
You've never, you, I don't, I do not, I don't care about Russia at all.

1008
00:52:39,580 --> 00:52:43,180
The only time I ever think about Russia before the like past few weeks or

1009
00:52:43,180 --> 00:52:43,480
whatever.

1010
00:52:43,480 --> 00:52:43,880
Dash cam footage?

1011
00:52:43,880 --> 00:52:47,880
Yes, dash cam footage or like a like a video of someone like, yeah, like, like.

1012
00:52:47,880 --> 00:52:50,980
Picking up a bomb and throwing it off like a 12 story building.

1013
00:52:50,980 --> 00:52:51,980
Or like, like, like.

1014
00:52:51,980 --> 00:52:54,380
Falling off a building, that's a big one.

1015
00:52:54,380 --> 00:52:57,180
Or like, like taming a bear with their mind or something.

1016
00:52:57,180 --> 00:53:01,940
like they definitely it's like Skyrim over there. Oh dude yeah we're so fucked

1017
00:53:01,940 --> 00:53:07,100
against them. Dude they just they don't care if they live or die it's scary a man

1018
00:53:07,100 --> 00:53:13,460
who has nothing to lose that's what Russia is. Yep that's why I'm gonna side

1019
00:53:13,460 --> 00:53:18,100
with with China and Russia early. I'm siding with China but not Russia. Luckily

1020
00:53:18,100 --> 00:53:23,740
I'm insanely advanced at killing people. I'm not siding with

1021
00:53:23,740 --> 00:53:27,880
Russia because I heard that Putin is gay. Oh really? Yeah, apparently he's gay with

1022
00:53:27,880 --> 00:53:31,420
Trump and with several other leaders of the Republican Party. You know, I'm actually

1023
00:53:31,420 --> 00:53:35,820
hearing that too that Vladimir Putin actually has done gay stuff with

1024
00:53:35,820 --> 00:53:40,300
Donald Trump, former United States President. Yeah, I heard that

1025
00:53:40,300 --> 00:53:44,340
apparently there was a pee tape between them. I heard there was a fat

1026
00:53:44,340 --> 00:53:49,140
guy who went over there that became a machine. I heard about that too. I heard

1027
00:53:49,140 --> 00:53:52,900
It was quite funny. I used to be the president and not only this, he was orange.

1028
00:53:52,900 --> 00:53:58,560
Yeah? Really? Yeah. I actually didn't receive that. I really want to cite your source.

1029
00:53:58,560 --> 00:54:01,640
Yeah, because there's a lot of misinformation being spread around the

1030
00:54:01,640 --> 00:54:05,080
internet these days, especially now with the Russia stuff. He's looking away.

1031
00:54:05,080 --> 00:54:08,320
He can't even look us in the eye. It's just misinformation. There was never a fat

1032
00:54:08,320 --> 00:54:13,940
orange president. www.there's a skinny gray president.

1033
00:54:13,940 --> 00:54:18,940
You know, Trump was actually skinny and gray.

1034
00:54:18,940 --> 00:54:22,940
He's skinny gray, he had big black eyes.

1035
00:54:22,940 --> 00:54:25,940
Despite popular belief, Donald Trump was never actually orange.

1036
00:54:25,940 --> 00:54:26,940
Like if you didn't know this.

1037
00:54:26,940 --> 00:54:27,940
In the movie.

1038
00:54:27,940 --> 00:54:31,940
In the movie, Donald Trump never admits to being orange.

1039
00:54:31,940 --> 00:54:34,940
Donald Trump never was fat or orange or cool or tall.

1040
00:54:34,940 --> 00:54:37,940
Donald Trump, it's funny, he never ate a hamburger.

1041
00:54:37,940 --> 00:54:42,940
There actually were under 100 hamburgers.

1042
00:54:42,940 --> 00:54:50,940
I am from everything it was actually mostly hot dogs coffee fee is actually

1043
00:54:50,940 --> 00:54:56,740
delicious coffee fee is actually an ancient ritualistic drink and he knew

1044
00:54:56,740 --> 00:55:04,900
exactly what he's talking about yeah and coffee hamburger did he I just need him

1045
00:55:04,900 --> 00:55:08,660
like I need a murder is still the funniest thing in a very cool is so

1046
00:55:08,660 --> 00:55:09,660
- It's so fucking good.

1047
00:55:09,660 --> 00:55:11,560
- It's just like, you know, honestly,

1048
00:55:11,560 --> 00:55:12,400
I fully understand. - Dude, that picture of him

1049
00:55:12,400 --> 00:55:13,220
with all the burgers.

1050
00:55:13,220 --> 00:55:14,560
- When he's standing with his hands like.

1051
00:55:14,560 --> 00:55:17,220
- Dude, I wish I was at that dinner.

1052
00:55:17,220 --> 00:55:20,220
I would do anything to eat just to watch him

1053
00:55:20,220 --> 00:55:22,340
eat a Big Mac in a room.

1054
00:55:22,340 --> 00:55:24,460
- That picture make me so hungry for hamburgers.

1055
00:55:24,460 --> 00:55:25,300
- Me too.

1056
00:55:25,300 --> 00:55:26,120
- Me too.

1057
00:55:26,120 --> 00:55:27,420
- My hamburger instinct.

1058
00:55:27,420 --> 00:55:28,820
- Over 100 hamburgers.

1059
00:55:28,820 --> 00:55:31,540
- Dude, he had Wendy's, Burger King, and McDonald's.

1060
00:55:31,540 --> 00:55:33,340
- I might have to get a burger on my way home.

1061
00:55:33,340 --> 00:55:35,860
- He had Wendy's, Burger King, and McDonald's.

1062
00:55:35,860 --> 00:55:36,680
- I might have to.

1063
00:55:36,680 --> 00:55:37,520
- My little thing went off.

1064
00:55:37,520 --> 00:55:40,560
enough. I just set some birders yeah yeah. Oh yeah,

1065
00:55:40,560 --> 00:55:46,080
birders, cheese birders, ham birders, yeah, veggie birders, no, no, a black

1066
00:55:46,080 --> 00:55:48,260
bean birder. Oh, what a black no,

1067
00:55:48,260 --> 00:55:56,120
impotable birder, no, no, disgusting, but ham. Who doesn't like ham in their

1068
00:55:56,120 --> 00:56:00,400
birder? Oh God, chicken birder, if you're in Canada, have they ever tried

1069
00:56:00,400 --> 00:56:03,440
making a pork burger, a pork burger? Yeah, I had one.

1070
00:56:04,240 --> 00:56:05,080
- Have you ever-- - Oh, I have.

1071
00:56:05,080 --> 00:56:07,120
- Bullpop Grill. - Oh, yeah, I had one.

1072
00:56:07,120 --> 00:56:07,960
Oh, they do?

1073
00:56:07,960 --> 00:56:08,800
I love that place.

1074
00:56:08,800 --> 00:56:11,080
- J-Uke Burger, I think I said that right.

1075
00:56:11,080 --> 00:56:12,240
- You better watch it.

1076
00:56:12,240 --> 00:56:13,240
- What?

1077
00:56:13,240 --> 00:56:15,120
- Stop trying to pronounce things correctly.

1078
00:56:15,120 --> 00:56:16,160
- You better be careful.

1079
00:56:16,160 --> 00:56:17,000
- You better be, it's all I'm gonna say.

1080
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:20,480
- What do I do, like, one letter off?

1081
00:56:20,480 --> 00:56:21,320
- Yeah, you're gonna get-- - It's just like

1082
00:56:21,320 --> 00:56:22,640
the craziest slur in the--

1083
00:56:22,640 --> 00:56:23,480
- You're gonna get kicked off

1084
00:56:23,480 --> 00:56:24,320
the BoJack Horseman writing room.

1085
00:56:24,320 --> 00:56:26,600
- I heard if you're-- (laughing)

1086
00:56:26,600 --> 00:56:27,480
- You're done for.

1087
00:56:27,480 --> 00:56:29,480
- Don't tell anyone that that's my fucking job, dude.

1088
00:56:29,480 --> 00:56:31,080
- I heard there's a-- - Mouth is, you're done.

1089
00:56:31,080 --> 00:56:35,360
I heard there's a really bad word that's one letter off of hamburger.

1090
00:56:35,360 --> 00:56:36,360
There's what?

1091
00:56:36,360 --> 00:56:38,600
There's a bad word that's one letter off of hamburger.

1092
00:56:38,600 --> 00:56:39,600
I heard that too.

1093
00:56:39,600 --> 00:56:40,600
Nerf-erder.

1094
00:56:40,600 --> 00:56:41,600
What?

1095
00:56:41,600 --> 00:56:44,960
That's way more words off.

1096
00:56:44,960 --> 00:56:45,960
What did you say?

1097
00:56:45,960 --> 00:56:46,960
Nerf-erder.

1098
00:56:46,960 --> 00:56:47,960
Oh my god, I'm going to have to edit this out.

1099
00:56:47,960 --> 00:56:48,960
Can you believe it?

1100
00:56:48,960 --> 00:56:49,960
You're a butt sniffer.

1101
00:56:49,960 --> 00:56:50,960
No.

1102
00:56:50,960 --> 00:56:51,960
No.

1103
00:56:51,960 --> 00:56:52,960
Sniff butts.

1104
00:56:52,960 --> 00:56:55,960
Don't say that to me.

1105
00:56:55,960 --> 00:56:58,440
I want to, I need to smell a butt.

1106
00:56:58,440 --> 00:56:59,440
Yeah?

1107
00:56:59,440 --> 00:57:00,440
Yeah.

1108
00:57:00,440 --> 00:57:06,740
put your ass in my face. He sniffed my butt like two months ago. I kind of got

1109
00:57:06,740 --> 00:57:13,420
I got the bug. I like sniffing butts now. I think he has to sniff it to

1110
00:57:13,420 --> 00:57:17,700
survive. I want to bury my head in a lazy boy after Patrick's been just sitting

1111
00:57:17,700 --> 00:57:23,820
there fucking just crushing seltzers just blowing carbon. No, these literally do

1112
00:57:23,820 --> 00:57:28,100
nothing to me. I could drive right now. I mean like a can of drive. You can't drive.

1113
00:57:28,100 --> 00:57:29,980
- Your life's over dude, you can't even, you're--

1114
00:57:29,980 --> 00:57:33,540
- I did, one time, oh dude, one time my dad took me

1115
00:57:33,540 --> 00:57:36,660
to the South Elementary School parking lot when I was 16

1116
00:57:36,660 --> 00:57:39,500
and I somehow got the car, there was like a,

1117
00:57:39,500 --> 00:57:41,940
there's like this like grass thing that goes down

1118
00:57:41,940 --> 00:57:43,780
to like the entrance of the school,

1119
00:57:43,780 --> 00:57:45,660
and you know where they like divide a parking lot

1120
00:57:45,660 --> 00:57:47,740
and then they like leave a little patch of grass

1121
00:57:47,740 --> 00:57:49,940
and like in between the stairs?

1122
00:57:49,940 --> 00:57:52,260
I somehow got the car all the way up that.

1123
00:57:52,260 --> 00:57:53,100
(laughing)

1124
00:57:53,100 --> 00:57:53,940
- I will never--

1125
00:57:53,940 --> 00:57:56,660
- I got my dad's 2003 Ford Focus all the way up that,

1126
00:57:56,660 --> 00:57:58,660
He was like, how the fuck did you do that?

1127
00:57:58,660 --> 00:58:04,340
If I ever let, sorry, it after this, this dog thing, I will never let you, I was

1128
00:58:04,340 --> 00:58:08,860
considering letting you borrow my car for something and just making you drive.

1129
00:58:08,860 --> 00:58:11,860
I thought it'd be funny, but I do feel like it would end up upside down.

1130
00:58:11,860 --> 00:58:12,460
Yeah.

1131
00:58:12,460 --> 00:58:12,780
Yeah.

1132
00:58:12,780 --> 00:58:14,100
It would be like, like a roof.

1133
00:58:14,100 --> 00:58:16,620
Dude, I literally, I get a text from Patrick.

1134
00:58:16,620 --> 00:58:17,620
I upside downed it.

1135
00:58:17,620 --> 00:58:22,060
I, I, can you come home?

1136
00:58:22,060 --> 00:58:23,460
I upside down to the car.

1137
00:58:24,580 --> 00:58:27,940
I tried to get someone to flip it, but it just made it worse.

1138
00:58:27,940 --> 00:58:31,860
Does it have to be right side up to drive it?

1139
00:58:31,860 --> 00:58:34,340
Does the wheels have to be on the ground to drive this?

1140
00:58:34,340 --> 00:58:36,980
I upside downed it pretty bad.

1141
00:58:36,980 --> 00:58:42,580
I upside downed it pretty bad, but I did get you, I got you some snacks.

1142
00:58:42,580 --> 00:58:43,580
You didn't even leave any snacks.

1143
00:58:43,580 --> 00:58:45,300
And you guys don't even have to pay me for gas.

1144
00:58:45,300 --> 00:58:54,420
Because I didn't move it, I just, by the way, I spent $100 on gas to upside down it.

1145
00:58:54,420 --> 00:59:00,260
pops a wheelie immediately just all the way over. It's inexplainable how he did it. Yeah.

1146
00:59:00,260 --> 00:59:05,500
It just I turn around I say okay here's the keys I turn around I hear a noise I

1147
00:59:05,500 --> 00:59:09,940

1148
00:59:09,940 --> 00:59:14,980
standing on top of it like the king of the hill and he's saying I upside downed

1149
00:59:14,980 --> 00:59:20,780
it. I'm so sorry that I upside downed it. I accidentally upside downed your car. Yeah you turn around

1150
00:59:20,780 --> 00:59:26,740

00:59:32,180 --> 00:59:33,300

00:59:33,300 --> 00:59:39,020

1154
00:59:39,020 --> 00:59:42,300

1155
00:59:42,300 --> 00:59:49,820
I deaded three people and upside down your oh dude. I I bloodied a guy. It's

1156
00:59:49,840 --> 00:59:55,040
That's part of it, though. It's upside down, dead end, three. Your car.

1157
00:59:55,040 --> 01:00:00,640
I need you guys to learn how to drive before we go to the store.

1158
01:00:00,640 --> 01:00:02,140
I was trying to learn to drive for a while.

1159
01:00:02,140 --> 01:00:03,340
Can I teach you guys?

1160
01:00:03,340 --> 01:00:05,640
I would love for you to teach me how to drive.

1161
01:00:05,640 --> 01:00:10,340
I was doing pretty well. I was learning to drive my mom's car, and then my dad

1162
01:00:10,340 --> 01:00:13,140
was like, "No, I'll teach you to drive a stick shift." It's like, "Okay, well,

1163
01:00:13,140 --> 01:00:13,940
I can't drive."

1164
01:00:13,940 --> 01:00:14,640
No, he's going to--

1165
01:00:14,640 --> 01:00:18,840
Yeah, no, it just literally, that stopped me from learning to drive because I

1166
01:00:18,840 --> 01:00:19,640
just could not.

1167
01:00:19,640 --> 01:00:22,840
I used to have a truck at work when I was doing construction,

1168
01:00:22,840 --> 01:00:26,120
and it was a stick shift, it was like an old Ford.

1169
01:00:26,120 --> 01:00:26,960
- Yeah.

1170
01:00:26,960 --> 01:00:29,920
- And I never learned, the guy just gave me the truck

1171
01:00:29,920 --> 01:00:32,720
and was like, "Yeah, just drive this to jobs and shit."

1172
01:00:32,720 --> 01:00:33,560
- Yeah.

1173
01:00:33,560 --> 01:00:35,080
- And I would just go 20 miles an hour,

1174
01:00:35,080 --> 01:00:37,840
just stopping like this every 10 feet.

1175
01:00:37,840 --> 01:00:40,480
- Literally, yeah, I would go to a parking lot

1176
01:00:40,480 --> 01:00:43,220
to drive around every day for an hour or whatever,

1177
01:00:43,220 --> 01:00:47,760
and literally would never be able to not just stop.

1178
01:00:47,760 --> 01:00:48,600
I could never go on the street.

1179
01:00:48,600 --> 01:00:51,600
I never once tried to learn how to do it though.

1180
01:00:51,600 --> 01:00:54,000
I, straight up, I just can't get behind the wheel of a car.

1181
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:58,080
It's not good for me and it's not good for pedestrians for me to be behind the wheel

1182
01:00:58,080 --> 01:00:59,080
of a car.

1183
01:00:59,080 --> 01:01:00,080
It's so easy to drive.

1184
01:01:00,080 --> 01:01:01,640
I don't know about that man.

1185
01:01:01,640 --> 01:01:02,640
It's so easy for me.

1186
01:01:02,640 --> 01:01:04,040
Literally 16 year olds drive.

1187
01:01:04,040 --> 01:01:06,440
Yeah, I tried when I was 16 and I couldn't do it.

1188
01:01:06,440 --> 01:01:09,360
But now you're 14 and you can do it.

1189
01:01:09,360 --> 01:01:11,600
It's true, I am 14 years old.

1190
01:01:11,600 --> 01:01:12,960
I would like to learn how to drive.

1191
01:01:12,960 --> 01:01:14,280
I'm just so damn lazy.

1192
01:01:14,280 --> 01:01:16,460
I also don't have a car now.

1193
01:01:16,460 --> 01:01:20,300
What if you had a cool as what if you had like a recliner in the driver's seat?

1194
01:01:20,300 --> 01:01:23,820
You can be lazy while you drive. That would be sick. You guys need you guys
