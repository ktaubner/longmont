00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
You're listening to Israel's number one podcast.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Podcasts for the heartless.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Crap monster.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:16,000
My question is, do you guys think that this is a cool look to me?

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,000
It looks pretty cool to me.

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Yeah.

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
I think I look cool. I walk down the street, everybody's high-fiving me now.

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Yeah. So describe your look. Describe your look to the listeners.

9
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,800
I am wearing a black do-rag and a gray tank top.

10
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:30,800
Yeah.

11
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:33,800
Yeah, which is what they hand you when you move to Queens.

12
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:34,800
Yeah.

13
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:35,800
Yeah.

14
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:36,800
Yeah.

15
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:39,800
And also a Volvo with the Puerto Rican flag wrapped around it.

16
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:41,800
Yeah, dude, you got a Volvo now.

17
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:42,800
Yeah, I got a Volvo.

18
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:44,800
I got a Puerto Rican Volvo installed.

19
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:46,800
They install it to you when you move to Queens, dude.

20
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:48,800
They turn you into a queen.

21
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:50,800
But it's just so hot.

22
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:52,800
I have to, this is why everyone...

23
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:54,800
You have to dress like that.

24
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:56,400
They're dressed like this because it's so hot.

25
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:58,120
Yeah, it just makes sense.

26
00:00:58,120 --> 00:01:02,320
I mean, and I always, yeah, I mean, this is just what people in New York wear.

27
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:04,480
And now I finally understand.

28
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:08,400
The do-rag, I didn't realize a do-rag is just to stop you from sweating.

29
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:09,400
Yeah.

30
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:10,400
Yeah.

31
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:11,400
I don't think that's what it's for.

32
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:12,400
No, it is.

33
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:14,960
I think it's for waves.

34
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:17,480
Waves of sweat that are cascading down your face.

35
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:23,040
That's why it's called a wave cap because it caps the waves so that they don't hit the

36
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:24,040
rest of your body.

37
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:27,480
The wife beater is also for sweat resistance.

38
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:30,760
It clings so tightly to you that it actually clogs all your pores.

39
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:35,680
You know in England they call those a jersey.

40
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:38,680
Better name.

41
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:40,440
Better name than wife beater for sure.

42
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:43,320
What do they call it?

43
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:46,600
They're both based off a guy from Jersey who's a wife beater.

44
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:53,680
That's true, that's why they call them.

45
00:01:53,680 --> 00:02:00,680
too easy to make fun of, especially now that I'm a New Yorker. It's too easy, dude. I've

46
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:09,680
never, ever been there, but God, it sucks. They don't even have bodega. I was at my local

47
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:19,520
bodega yesterday, and it's just so amazing. It's like a French salon. It's just the melding

48
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:24,840
of the minds. Everybody's there asking for a BEC, you know, and I'm asking what that

49
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:30,320
is. And I'm wearing this exact outfit. You know, the durag and the gray and white beater

50
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:31,920
walking into the bodega.

51
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:37,200
I do want to see you walk outside in that outfit.

52
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:38,200
I will.

53
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:40,800
I'll see how that goes.

54
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:46,800
I'm going to be one of the famous Times Square people, like the Spider-Man.

55
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:52,200
Yeah, you're the Times Square person, but you're just Jamie Kennedy from Malibu's Most Wanted.

56
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:54,800
Yeah, I have gone full...

57
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:58,100
You're like Elmo, but you're out there, you're going like, "Yeah, what's up player?"

58
00:02:58,100 --> 00:03:03,100
I have gone full JKMMW.

59
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:04,100
This is my look now.

60
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:07,420
Jedi Knight Malibu's Most Wanted.

61
00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:11,960
It's one of the early 2000s Star Wars games.

62
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:18,520
No, but I have been looking, just looking like this for a couple days now and we went and

63
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:22,520
got a locker today for our apartment.

64
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:23,520
Yeah.

65
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:27,720
Yeah, I did not, I wasn't wearing the do-rag, but I was wearing the wife beater and I did

66
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:31,240
not, the guy was not getting good vibes off of me.

67
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:32,880
Yeah, well, yeah, I mean, fuck it.

68
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:38,280
Yeah, he was like in Park Slope and he was like, he's definitely, he was gonna call the

69
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:39,280
police on me.

70
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:40,280
Yeah.

71
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:42,280
That's what they do to people like you, dude.

72
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:46,600
Yeah, that's why it's so hard for people like me in New York City because the police

73
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:51,000
The police are always harassing us for wearing white beards

74
00:03:51,000 --> 00:04:00,200
And hanging out in bodega's yeah, it's fucking annoying dude my favorite bodega is the empire state building ever been to that one

75
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:07,480
One of the most powerful bodega's in uh, the united states. Yeah. Another great one is the one in the statue of liberty. Yeah

76
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:14,120
Yeah. See, because you can get like Cracker Jacks and a little Statue of Liberty there.

77
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:20,440
Exactly. So what I understand about a bodega is that it is a place where you can get pizza.

78
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:23,800
Yeah, exactly. So 7-Eleven is a bodega.

79
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:26,120
Yeah, 7-Eleven is the world's bodega.

80
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:29,720
Pizza Hut is a bodega. Chuck E. Cheese is a bodega junior.

81
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:38,600
And that's just, you know, I'm learning and I'm growing as a person every day in this beautiful city.

82
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:40,940
Yeah.

83
00:04:40,940 --> 00:04:43,020
Yeah.

84
00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:50,040
Yeah. The rule here now is like the subway is for essential workers only.

85
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:53,800
And I just want to roll on that bitch looking like this so bad.

86
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:59,160
And then when someone asks, I'm like, "I'm a nurse, obviously. What do you fucking think?"

87
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:03,000
They really did the subways for essential workers only?

88
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:09,400
That's what when you well I wrote it yesterday but uh luckily I was wearing a suit but basically

89
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:13,760
when you walk on like a voiceover thing is like the subway is for essential workers only

90
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:18,720
please do not travel but I don't think they actually I don't think they actually check

91
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:24,520
they do yeah yeah they would if I went on it now but yeah I think I'm okay.

92
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:28,520
You have to show them your essential workers card.

93
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:33,240
Apparently an essential job is being like a white dude in JNCO jeans walking up and down

94
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:34,920
the subway cart asking for money.

95
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:37,160
I didn't know that but apparently that's an essential job.

96
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:39,840
That's an essential part of the New York ecosystem.

97
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:40,840
That's true.

98
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:41,840
That's true.

99
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:42,840
You take that out.

100
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:43,840
Yeah.

101
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:44,840
At least one of those guys.

102
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:46,000
He travels between the cars.

103
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,640
That's not something people do in Boston but they do it here where people just walk between

104
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:52,120
the cars because it's cool.

105
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:56,160
It's so much cooler, like in every movie I've ever seen.

106
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:57,160
Where there's a chase?

107
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:59,520
Yeah, they go through the subway cars.

108
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:01,520
Yeah, here everybody does that.

109
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:05,720
Everybody clings to the top of the subway car when they go under a tunnel.

110
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:09,240
They stand on top and they jump over when they go under a tunnel.

111
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:13,760
Yeah, exactly, to escape a guy who wasn't quite fast enough ducking so he gets hit by

112
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:14,760
the tunnel.

113
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:16,760
Yeah, he gets hit by a traffic sign going by.

114
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:20,160
But you don't see it because it's a PG-13 movie.

115
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:22,160
They actually have turnstiles on top of the train,

116
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:24,340
'cause so many people do jump off of bridges

117
00:06:24,340 --> 00:06:26,000
to land on top of the train.

118
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,120
- Yeah, that's like, they actually have a turnstile

119
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:29,400
on every bridge, too.

120
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:30,240
- Yeah.

121
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:31,720
- Because you could jump off the bridge.

122
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:33,720
- They wanna make some money off people

123
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:35,160
committing suicide for once.

124
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:36,000
- Yeah, exactly.

125
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,040
(laughing)

126
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:38,680
- That's how they're gonna get--

127
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:40,960
- Listen, you're allowed to jump off this bridge,

128
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:42,220
you're allowed to jump off this bridge,

129
00:06:42,220 --> 00:06:43,920
but you have to pay 25 cents first.

130
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:44,760
It's very cheap.

131
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:46,480
- Yeah, it's a very cheap--

132
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:48,040
- It's honestly a pretty good deal.

133
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:49,920
- Yeah, it's very cheap 'cause if it was too expensive,

134
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:51,240
people wouldn't kill themselves.

135
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:53,720
- Yeah, but they're gonna raise that in like two years.

136
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:54,560
You know, they're gonna fucking--

137
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:55,680
- Yeah, they keep raising it, dude.

138
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:56,520
- Ugh, it's the worst.

139
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:58,800
- Back in my day, it was 10 cents.

140
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:00,680
- 10 cents to kill yourself off a bridge.

141
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:03,040
- It used to cost a dime to kill yourself.

142
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:05,160
Now it's damn near a nickel.

143
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:08,600
- Yeah, they got you putting all kinds of coins up in there.

144
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:10,120
- And if you try to jump the turnstile,

145
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:12,680
there's a cop there who's gonna shoot you in the head.

146
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:14,200
- Yeah, and now they want you to do this

147
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:16,560
contactless pay on it with your phone.

148
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:17,400
- Yeah, yeah.

149
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:18,440
- Yeah, they have an app now.

150
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:19,520
- Yeah. - Yeah.

151
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:20,520
Ugh.

152
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:21,520
Disgusting.

153
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:22,520
Please.

154
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:23,520
Please.

155
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:26,800
Yesterday I was, somebody did try to assassinate me on a bridge with a firework.

156
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:27,800
Yeah?

157
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:28,800
Yeah.

158
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:29,800
I was walking over the Manhattan Bridge.

159
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:31,320
Yesterday me and Jana went on a 10 mile walk.

160
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:32,320
Wow.

161
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:33,320
And I wore vans.

162
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:34,320
Nice.

163
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:35,320
That's very smart.

164
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:36,880
Yeah, I got fucked up.

165
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:41,840
But while we were crossing over into, as soon as we like step foot in Chinatown, giant firework

166
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:44,800
explodes right next to my head that somebody shot from the ground.

167
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:45,800
Whoa.

168
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:46,800
Damn.

169
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,640
And then they ran away like cowards before I could kill them.

170
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:53,840
So but I was going to and retaliate for them attempting to kill me and my bride.

171
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:56,840
Yeah I would have teleported to them but that was just me.

172
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:58,400
Yeah I pretty much thought about that.

173
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:04,160
I almost spent my throwing knife but then I was like you know I'll never get that back.

174
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:05,160
Yeah.

175
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:08,080
You know that'll be in some evidence locker for the next 20 years and that thing was given

176
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:10,520
to me by a shinobi.

177
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:11,520
Yeah.

178
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:12,520
Yeah.

179
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:18,200
a shinobi who looks exactly like me right now and he lives in uh, Astoria.

180
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:25,480
What have you guys been up to? I've been up to fucking nothing, been packing.

181
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:29,480
Packing the shit up. You got, you got way too many boxes I think.

182
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:33,720
Nah, nah there's so much shit in this apartment. You think you have that many things?

183
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:39,720
We needed, yeah dude, we couldn't like, when we first moved here we couldn't walk around.

184
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:44,080
No, you know what it is, is this place is so fucking small

185
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:46,460
that we need like, we got like a bunch of small boxes

186
00:08:46,460 --> 00:08:48,360
so it doesn't like crowd the place up.

187
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:50,740
The new place is small?

188
00:08:50,740 --> 00:08:51,680
No, this place is small.

189
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:53,400
The new place is bigger. Oh, this place is small.

190
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:54,240
Yeah.

191
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:55,640
But it's the same amount of stuff,

192
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:59,480
but you're just, you just think smaller boxes will...

193
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:05,400
We got small boxes and medium and large.

194
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:08,160
Okay, you got small, medium and large.

195
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:14,240
But what is your rationale for getting small boxes instead of large boxes?

196
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:18,240
Can you admit before that it's going to be the same?

197
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:22,360
We've been transporting them, we've been just like packing shit up and then putting it in

198
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:25,680
Dom's parents' garage.

199
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:32,640
So it's easier to put small boxes in her car and bring them to the garage.

200
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:33,640
Okay.

201
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:34,640
Okay.

202
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:37,080
We arrived at somewhat of an explanation.

203
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:38,080
Yeah, that's good enough for me.

204
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:39,800
See, that's the first time I've made sense.

205
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:40,800
Yeah, that was incredible.

206
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:41,800
Yeah.

207
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:42,800
Congrats, pal.

208
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:45,240
They must have turned the AC on in Pat's building for this episode.

209
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:46,240
Yeah.

210
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:47,560
No, dude, I'm still...

211
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:53,240
I need to get somewhere with AC to record soon because every fucking episode I've been

212
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:54,720
chicken brained.

213
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:55,720
Yeah.

214
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:57,480
Yeah, people want the chicken brain episode.

215
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:58,480
You don't want it.

216
00:09:58,480 --> 00:09:59,480
People want it, but they don't want it.

217
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:00,480
You don't want the chicken brain episode.

218
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:01,480
I promise.

219
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:02,480
I promise you, you do not.

220
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:03,480
It's not good for you.

221
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:04,920
I'm not sure if I have it or not.

222
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:07,440
I might have it on a hard drive, but I refuse to check.

223
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:08,600
I don't want to go back and listen.

224
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:09,740
It's just not good.

225
00:10:09,740 --> 00:10:10,580
It's imagine--

226
00:10:10,580 --> 00:10:11,520
- We might as well have been all wearing

227
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:13,080
a KFC bucket on our heads.

228
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:13,920
- Yeah.

229
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:16,400
Imagine like the worst episode

230
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:17,560
that you've heard of this podcast

231
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:22,160
and then add like 50% more dead air to it.

232
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:23,000
- Yeah.

233
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:23,820
- I had to imagine--

234
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:24,920
- About two pounds of chicken.

235
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:25,760
(laughing)

236
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:26,600
- Yeah.

237
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:27,860
- Yeah, two pounds of chicken

238
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:30,960
and then me saying something about the chicken.

239
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:33,800
- Also, Cameron's like first time having fried chicken,

240
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:36,560
which is like somebody's first time having a cigarette.

241
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:37,820
Like they vomit.

242
00:10:37,820 --> 00:10:41,140
Anytime somebody has a KFC for the first time,

243
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:41,980
like yeah.

244
00:10:41,980 --> 00:10:42,800
- Cameron had to leave.

245
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:43,640
Cameron like went home for a little bit.

246
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:45,540
- He ate one piece and to teach him a lesson

247
00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:47,260
we should have made him eat the entire

248
00:10:47,260 --> 00:10:48,400
bag of meatloaf. - I did not eat one,

249
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:49,920
I think I ate two pieces.

250
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:53,000
- It is the one year anniversary of the chicken episode.

251
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:53,960
- Yeah, today.

252
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:57,160
We did record the chicken brain episode one year ago today.

253
00:10:57,160 --> 00:10:59,640
- I did get an Instagram notification.

254
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:03,000
- I might have to fuck around with some chicken today.

255
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,080
yet and i were talking about it

256
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:08,180
yeah i might have to do it in a spot

257
00:11:08,180 --> 00:11:11,560
yeah which is another word for bodyguard

258
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:16,600
near i've fungal i'd my nasty he has slept on my neck weird and fucked it up

259
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:19,920
yeah you need to stop sleeping uh... pencil dives

260
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:21,460
uh... yet

261
00:11:21,460 --> 00:11:25,320
yeah i thought he was diving on your bed and getting stuck at least sleeping

262
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:29,140
straight up i do a handstand to fall asleep and then sometimes my arms give

263
00:11:29,140 --> 00:11:29,900
out

264
00:11:29,900 --> 00:11:32,080
and i land on my head

265
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:34,000
- Hey, dude, I could've snapped my neck in my sleep.

266
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:34,840
- That's why you're so smart,

267
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:38,040
because the blood has been pooling in your brain for 20 years.

268
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:40,080
- If I bend my neck right when I'm sleeping,

269
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:42,320
it restricts the blood from leaving my brain,

270
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:44,280
so it all stays in there and gets smarter,

271
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:46,880
and it practices being in my brain,

272
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:47,720
and it's increasing my insulin.

273
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:49,400
- You do some brain practice.

274
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:51,760
- I've been doing brain practices lately.

275
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:54,460
- Yeah, that's why my grandma, she had a brain bleed,

276
00:11:54,460 --> 00:11:55,640
but for that last hour,

277
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:57,960
she was like the smartest bitch in my family.

278
00:11:57,960 --> 00:11:58,800
- Yeah. - Yeah.

279
00:11:58,800 --> 00:11:59,640
- Yeah.

280
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:01,720
- 'Cause when that blood gets moving up there,

281
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:05,000
i'm she's doing math problems and stuff in the hospital bed

282
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:08,760
and we like we need to get you a job and then she died

283
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:09,920

284
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:11,900

- Mine?

298
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:39,380
- Yeah.

299
00:12:39,380 --> 00:12:42,900
- John and Ruth on my dad's side,

300
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:46,380
and then Bob and Nancy on my mom's side,

301
00:12:46,380 --> 00:12:48,520
and Everybody But John Is Dead.

302

- Nice.

303
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:54,180
- Well, that's such a great young adult novel name.

- Everybody But John Is Dead.

305
00:12:55,020 --> 00:12:56,340
- Everybody But John Is Dead.

306
00:12:56,340 --> 00:12:57,380
(laughing)

307
00:12:57,380 --> 00:12:58,220

- Yeah.

310
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:07,400
I've talked about John on here. Is he the one who meowed like a cat? No. Oh yeah, he's the one who ran away.

311
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:14,400
He's the one who ran away from home and lived in a boxcar. Yeah, he's the one. He packed up a bindle.

312
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:22,400
Yeah, he packed up a bindle full of kombucha and like, smelled himself. He just poured kombucha into a cloth.

313
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:24,240
- Put shit into a bag.

314
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:28,100
- And then wrapped it up in a bandana

315
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:30,640
and put it on a stick in the middle of winter

316
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:33,480
and was like, hey, I might be home late.

317
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:35,120

319
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:40,580
- I'm off to do this kombucha.

320
00:13:40,580 --> 00:13:44,280

321
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:45,240

00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:48,000
- He's boofing it.

324
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:48,840
- Where is your microphone?

00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:51,160

338
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:21,440
You do not care.

339
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:22,440
You don't care about anything except yourself, dude.

340
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:23,440
I don't care.

341
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:24,440
I don't really care about anything.

342
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:25,440
You're so selfish.

343
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:28,600
I've been doing a lot of Squidward Joker lately.

344
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:35,480
I've been doing, like, "You wanna know how I got this big blue nose?

345
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:39,760
Well, my father was a squidward."

346
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:47,840
"You wanna know how I learned this clarinet?

347
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:52,440
He put the clarinet in my mouth and said, "Why so?"

348
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:55,960
He sighed up, "Why so, Squidward?"

349
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:57,960
Oh, fuck.

350
00:14:57,960 --> 00:15:04,360
Yeah, I've been really, really making myself happy with that one.

351
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:06,040
That's how I've been getting through the days.

352
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:09,080
I used to know a sponge.

353
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:15,320
I used to work at a hamburger store.

354
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:21,720
He put his claws in my mouth and he said, "Squidward, why don't you smile more?"

355
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:30,480
He put his claws in my mouth and he said, "Where's me first dollar?"

356
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:36,880
I had a boss, used to curse a lot, said, "Eeeeee!"

357
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:37,880
Remember that episode?

358
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:38,880
I remember that episode.

359
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:41,480
Wait, he didn't say that.

360
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:42,480
That's what the swear is.

361
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:43,880
Yeah, he curses with the doll.

362
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:44,880
He swears.

363
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:47,480

364
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:49,600

00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:32,040

thanks dude

383
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:37,120
while

384
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:41,640
while yeah that's pretty good yeah i know that makes it that makes it uh...

385
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:42,640
I know, no.

386
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:43,640
I mean, so that's bad.

387
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:44,640
Yeah, no, no, no.

388
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:45,640
They're going to use that in court.

389
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:46,640
I'm with you guys.

390
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:47,640
We should release Ron Jeremy.

391
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:48,640
Mm-hmm.

392
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:49,640
We should release Ron Jeremy.

393
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:54,960
Anybody who has less than 25 counts, I think they should be free.

394
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:58,000
Hey, if Trump gets away with it.

395
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,240
Because he's the president.

396
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:03,040
So also, Ron Jeremy should be the president now.

397
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:04,040
That's also how it should work.

398
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:05,040
Yeah, no, because it's fewer.

399
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:06,040
It's fewer.

400
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:07,040
And when you justify it that way, he should have the lowest.

401
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:11,280
and we don't justify it that way and he's kind of like it only gets to be one sixth

402
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:14,320
president because he only did one sixth of it

403
00:17:14,320 --> 00:17:18,320
uh... so actually people have to hit twenty five to become president yeah it's

404
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:20,580
like a kill streak

405
00:17:20,580 --> 00:17:24,520
that's like the tactical nuke president

406
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:26,920
uh...

407
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:29,920
oh yeah pat you have to do your new character on this episode

408
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:32,120
see oh fuck

409
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:34,560
pat we promised the fans pat will do

410
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:38,560
I know, but I texted you this morning. I already told you. What happened?

411
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:43,560
Patrick has to do it to reveal his new character, Homie Hamburger, that he's been developing.

412
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:45,560
No, no, I can't. I don't even...

413
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:47,560
You can. You absolutely have to.

414
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:51,560
No, I texted you this morning. I lost all my notes on Homie Hamburger.

415
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:53,560
Did you lose... were they in a Moleskine or something?

416
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:54,560
Yes.

417
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:57,560
See, you know, you gotta use an app, dude. You gotta use Evernote.

418
00:17:57,560 --> 00:17:58,560
Yeah.

419
00:17:58,560 --> 00:18:00,560
You can't be using Moleskine for stuff like that.

420
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:08,560
like that. I like using my micron pens. So how'd you lose them?

421
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:16,240
Subway. Subway sandwich or subway train? On the way to subway.

422
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:22,120
On the way to subway? Yeah. Did it fall out of your big pocket with a hole in it?

423
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:28,600
No, I think I might have left it on the 7-eleven counter on the way to subway.

424
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:33,160
You were reading, you were testing the new character on the 7-11 cashier?

425
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:34,160
Yeah.

426
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:36,160
You left the notebook with the accent.

427
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:37,840
That's what happened, yeah.

428
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:38,840
Can I pitch you my new character?

429
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:40,280
You remember what it sounded like?

430
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:41,720
Yeah, come on.

431
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:42,720
Uh, no.

432
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:46,440
I had a waveform drawn on the notebook.

433
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:48,960
That you were gonna mimic?

434
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:51,080
Yeah, that I was gonna mimic and do the voice of.

435
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:52,080
Well, do your best.

436
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:55,680
Did the waveform spell out anything cool?

437
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:56,680
It said homie hamburger.

438
00:18:56,680 --> 00:18:57,680
Alright, well say it.

439
00:18:57,680 --> 00:19:04,680
say it. Well I don't remember. Type out Homie Hamburger and recreate it. Yeah look at that.

440
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:12,560
It was a special waveform. It was like the Nintendo Labo Piano and I have to... Look

441
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:17,360
I just want to first of all I want to apologize. Did it sound like this? Homie Hamburger. Did

442
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:21,120
it sound like that? No. Okay so did it just sound like this? Homie Hamburger. Did it sound

443
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:27,120
like that? It was closer. Okay so something like Homie Hamburger. Was it like that? Just

444
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:29,120
Just tell me if I'm getting closer or further away.

445
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:30,120
Keep going closer.

446
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:33,120
Okay, so is it like, "Hey, I want a hamburger!"

447
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:34,120
Is it like that?

448
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:35,120
A little bit closer.

449
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:36,120
Getting closer, okay.

450
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:37,120
Is it like, "Hey, I want a hamburger!"

451
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:38,120
Is it like that?

452
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:39,120
I think that might be it.

453
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:40,120
I think you should...

454
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:41,120
I think, wait, now...

455
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:42,120
All right, do it.

456
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:43,120
Wait, Cameron, now say, "Hey, guys, we're gonna...

457
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:44,120
Hey, homies, we're gonna go get a hamburger."

458
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:45,120
"Hey, homies, we're gonna get a hamburger!"

459
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:46,120
That was it!

460
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:47,120
That was the way it was.

461
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:48,120
Now say, "If I don't get a hamburger, I'm gonna go get a hamburger."

462
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:49,120
That was it.

463
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:50,120
That was it.

464
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:51,120
That was it.

465
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:53,120
"Hey homie, we're gonna get a hamburger!"

466
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:54,120
That was it!

467
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:55,120
That was the way it was.

468
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:59,120
Now say if I don't get a hamburger, I'm gonna bust a cap in your ass.

469
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:02,120
"If I don't get a hamburger, I'm gonna bust a cap in your ass!"

470
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:04,120
That's exactly it.

471
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:05,120
Does that sound like Homie Hamburg?

472
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:07,120
That was Homie Hamburg, wow.

473
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:10,120
Thank you, thank you Cameron for performing Homie Hamburg for us.

474
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:14,120
Yeah, I'm actually a sounds detective, so I've been working on stuff like cases like that for years.

475
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:16,120
Really? That makes sense, despite being the producer.

476
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:18,120
How did you get that job?

477
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:23,320
I basically detected a bunch of sounds and then the police contacted me and said we'd like you to work for us

478
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:27,480
Well, and I accepted immediately so you work for the police. Yeah

479
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:29,760
Whoa, what?

480
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:31,760
What you guys didn't know that?

481
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:35,360
Take one good look at me and tell me that I'm gonna be happy with that

482
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:42,960
Do I look like I would fucking do a podcast with the police yeah

483
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:43,960
Yeah.

484
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:44,960
He looked like an undercover cop.

485
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:45,960
The worst undercover cop ever.

486
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:59,160
A white dude walking in in a grey tank top, a grey white beater and a do-rag.

487
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:01,840
Be like, "Hey, what's up man?

488
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:02,840
I'm at the bodega.

489
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:05,840
Are you guys selling drugs here?"

490
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:07,560
Oh man.

491
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:13,000
Oh man. Hey man, have you guys seen any guns around?

492
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:17,520
Just immediately getting your ass beat for that accent.

493
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:24,760
Yeah, I put mascara on my, like, on the hair on my upper lip to make it look like I have

494
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:29,440
a thin pencil mustache. God damn.

495
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:36,480
Yeah. Bad showing. My Blue Lives Matter tattoo showing through my chest.

496
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:40,480
Punisher logo, with the confederate flag.

497
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:49,800
Hey man, do you guys sell loose cigarettes?

498
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:53,200
I just want to put one in my ear.

499
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:56,440
I'm just gonna put it in the wave cap.

500
00:21:56,440 --> 00:22:00,240
I'm just gonna have it hanging out of the wave cap.

501
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:03,120
That's all I need it for.

502
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:08,040
I'm looking at that one photoshop of LeBron wearing the durag with the cigarette in it

503
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:09,440
and trying to match it exactly.

504
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:14,400
Yeah, you're looking at your phone up to the bathroom mirror in the bodega and going like,

505
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:16,880
"Oh, come on, my brothers in the force need this.

506
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:20,160
Come on, come on, we're so close."

507
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:21,160
Yeah.

508
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:32,560
I have like a full-length XLR cable attached to a Zoom on my chest.

509
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:37,180
wearing like a GoPro on your head yeah yeah and the poor like 70 year old

510
00:22:37,180 --> 00:22:43,360
Mexican lady who just makes sandwiches at the store so confused

511
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:50,360
she thinks I'm one of her son's friends your XLR cable is like going all the way

512
00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:58,640
like outside to like a huge like it's plugged into a van it's plugged into like a huge like

513
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:02,640
Marshall stack that's being like pointed at the police station.

514
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:04,640
[laughter]

515
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:08,640
So they can hear everything you're saying and so can everyone else.

516
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:12,640
You're talking into a paper cup on a string and there's a police officer

517
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:16,640
outside with a cup to his ear. And then I get back to the precinct

518
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:20,640
and they're like, "Yeah, it turns out today is the day we

519
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:24,640
defunded the plainclothes officers program in New York."

520
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:29,640
Fuck, man. I worked so hard on that accent.

521
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:32,640
Yeah, I took classes in that.

522
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:40,640
I worked so hard. I listened to the Cheech and Chong Mexican American song for three hours.

523
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:44,640
Yeah.

524
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:48,640
I downloaded a Daddy Yankee album.

525
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:50,640
For nothing.

526
00:23:52,640 --> 00:24:00,600
All right, what's our list today? This list is on ranker.com and it's called the

527
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:06,080
head the headline of the of the of the article if you look on the in the at the

528
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:09,240
website itself it says Patrick is a terrible friend of SpongeBob if you just

529
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:12,580
pay attention but if you look at like that at the top at the tab it is

530
00:24:12,580 --> 00:24:16,360
actually a list it says 14 reasons why Patrick is a terrible friend of

531
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:21,160
SpongeBob and if I'm not mistaken this is though these 14 reasons are what white

532
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:27,120
nationalists are referring to when they use that number. I think it is yeah.

533
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:34,360
There's a there's a tab here on the side that says winners and losers and it

534
00:24:34,360 --> 00:24:42,920
looks like today Barry Pepper moved down. So Barry Pepper sorry sorry man you're

535
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:46,680
today's uh you're the Ranker.com loser. Oh shit.

536
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:54,240
day. Faith Walper moved up. Oh good, good for Faith Walper. So did Black Adam. Who's Black

537
00:24:54,240 --> 00:25:03,000
Adam? That's the villain from Shazam. Ah, okay. Yeah. He's Egyptian. I thought it was just

538
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:09,840
how suburban white teenagers refer to their one black friend. Yeah, that's what they call

539
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:16,320
Pete Wentz. Yeah. They call him Black Adam for some reason. No, they're actually doing

540
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:18,880
a new diverse reboot of Adam Ruins Everything.

541
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:25,520
And they're sending out a casting call for Black Adam.

542
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:28,880
One of the greatest names, for sure.

543
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:32,040
Patrick is a terrible friend of SpongeBob if you just pay attention.

544
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:36,280
SpongeBob SquarePants remains a beloved show with incredibly memorable characters.

545
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:40,120
One particular personality, though, seems eviler than most people realize.

546
00:25:40,120 --> 00:25:42,740
In fact, he's the absolute worst.

547
00:25:42,740 --> 00:25:46,580
theories about Patrick Star demonstrate he's an awful friend to Spongebob and

548
00:25:46,580 --> 00:25:50,860
might even hurt his supposed pal on purpose. When it comes to Spongebob

549
00:25:50,860 --> 00:25:54,680
Squarepants theories fans believe Patrick is often responsible for the title

550
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:58,480
characters perils. Patrick frequently shows how little he cares and his

551
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:04,020
relationship with Spongebob looks toxic at best and abusive at worst. It's easy

552
00:26:04,020 --> 00:26:08,660
to see why many people think the smiling pink starfish is a complete psychopath.

553
00:26:08,660 --> 00:26:13,260
this is awesome dude I first I thought this was gonna be like from a 13 year

554
00:26:13,260 --> 00:26:19,540
old but it is like it's like a like an ex-gawker writer yeah is like well

555
00:26:19,540 --> 00:26:29,020
Patrick is actually an abuser yeah this is from no 2019 it's so it's so funny

556
00:26:29,020 --> 00:26:36,420
how like every stupid fucking like take like oh like the himbo's or pedophile

557
00:26:36,420 --> 00:26:39,580
Dating a himbo makes you a pedophile and stuff.

558
00:26:39,580 --> 00:26:45,580
It always traces back to some form of like media conversation that a person was having.

559
00:26:45,580 --> 00:26:46,820
Yeah, every single time.

560
00:26:46,820 --> 00:26:51,940
Like, literally, the himbos are pedophiles thing, I think, who showed me that?

561
00:26:51,940 --> 00:26:54,180
It was you, because you wrote that.

562
00:26:54,180 --> 00:26:57,740
It was me in the mirror, because I wrote the himbos are pedophiles.

563
00:26:57,740 --> 00:26:59,740
You wrote it on a mirror.

564
00:26:59,740 --> 00:27:01,980
That's how you write things like that.

565
00:27:01,980 --> 00:27:08,680
It was about, so that started because they were talking about Andy from Parks and Recreation.

566
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:11,140
Yeah, dude.

567
00:27:11,140 --> 00:27:12,700
Total himbo, yeah.

568
00:27:12,700 --> 00:27:15,780
Dude, so fucking stupid.

569
00:27:15,780 --> 00:27:22,180
Just turn the fucking TV, it's literally just people who think like, "Oh, if I criticize

570
00:27:22,180 --> 00:27:24,180
media that makes me smart."

571
00:27:24,180 --> 00:27:25,620
TV is real life, dude.

572
00:27:25,620 --> 00:27:27,980
Yeah, I mean, it's insane that people...

573
00:27:27,980 --> 00:27:33,860
People go and get six year degrees in media criticism.

574
00:27:33,860 --> 00:27:39,420
And then they come away and they're like, "Neo is actually not the good guy.

575
00:27:39,420 --> 00:27:41,100
The good guy was the computers."

576
00:27:41,100 --> 00:27:44,780
It's like, "How fucked can you be?"

577
00:27:44,780 --> 00:27:46,740
You're a messed up person.

578
00:27:46,740 --> 00:27:50,300
Yeah, Patrick is actually the anti-hero.

579
00:27:50,300 --> 00:27:56,580
Yeah, that was Dasani Bottle who sent me that.

580
00:27:56,580 --> 00:27:57,580
Dasani Bottle?

581
00:27:57,580 --> 00:27:59,580
Yeah, @thesunnybottle sent me that.

582
00:27:59,580 --> 00:28:01,580
Yeah, that's my name too, actually.

583
00:28:01,580 --> 00:28:03,580
We're all named... I'm the Sunny Bottle.

584
00:28:03,580 --> 00:28:05,580
No, you're not. Just me and Caleb.

585
00:28:05,580 --> 00:28:06,580
No, I am too.

586
00:28:06,580 --> 00:28:08,580
We're both the Sunny Bottle. You're stupid Patrick.

587
00:28:08,580 --> 00:28:10,580
Actually, I'm, um...

588
00:28:10,580 --> 00:28:12,580
You're one of those little flavor water enhancers

00:28:12,580 --> 00:28:14,580
'cause you can't drink plain water.

590
00:28:14,580 --> 00:28:15,580

591
00:28:15,580 --> 00:28:17,580
'Cause you can't even fucking handle just a plain water.

592
00:28:17,580 --> 00:28:20,580
You're one of those guys who's like, "This water tastes creamy."

593
00:28:20,580 --> 00:28:21,580
Yeah.

594
00:28:21,580 --> 00:28:22,580
What?

595
00:28:22,580 --> 00:28:26,580
You're one of those guys who thinks Nestle water tastes creamy.

596
00:28:26,580 --> 00:28:31,660

617
00:30:06,700 --> 00:30:10,860
Hershey's kisses no meat kisses. We're eating a meat and vegetable kiss

618
00:30:10,860 --> 00:30:13,700
Don't get your hopes up

619
00:30:13,700 --> 00:30:19,260
Number one on this on this list is he makes spongebob feel ugly

620
00:30:19,260 --> 00:30:23,100
Wow everyone deals with bad breath at some point

621
00:30:23,100 --> 00:30:29,980
But spongebob's Sunday breath takes the cake in season 2 episode 1 something smells his breath gets so bad everyone runs away from him

622
00:30:29,980 --> 00:30:34,340
Spongebob goes to his best friend for advice, but Patrick tells him people are actually running from his bad

623
00:30:34,340 --> 00:30:38,260
looks. Patrick claims Spongebob needs to scream to the world about his ugliness.

624
00:30:38,260 --> 00:30:43,220
Patrick even accuses Spongebob of passing ugly to him, like a contagion. Way to

625
00:30:43,220 --> 00:30:50,020
crush your friend's self-esteem, Pat. Wow. I can't believe that. That's fucked up,

626
00:30:50,020 --> 00:30:53,620
dude. I mean, yeah, that's something you should never do to a friend, is when their

627
00:30:53,620 --> 00:30:59,300
bad breath makes an entire movie theater full of people have, um, they start

628
00:30:59,300 --> 00:31:02,980
crying from the bad breath and they all run out and there's, and fires start and

629
00:31:02,980 --> 00:31:06,380
stuff and then you say it's because they're ugly that's that's abuser

630
00:31:06,380 --> 00:31:10,540
behavior. If there's one thing I would never do is call anybody I know

631
00:31:10,540 --> 00:31:16,940
especially not my close friends fat or ugly. You would never call your friend fat?

632
00:31:16,940 --> 00:31:22,220
Never no no and so I think that's kind of you know that we're seeing a pattern

633
00:31:22,220 --> 00:31:26,900
emerge here from Patrick and I think this is kind of this is an early episode

634
00:31:26,900 --> 00:31:31,420
this is kind of the beginning of his abusive behavior. Yeah it's true it's

635
00:31:31,420 --> 00:31:35,540
true yeah and also it's intersectional because Spongebob is yellow and he's

636
00:31:35,540 --> 00:31:40,180
actually pink mm-hmm so there's something there too yeah there's

637
00:31:40,180 --> 00:31:48,540
something there and he's also a cartoon that's okay yeah yeah and he's square

638
00:31:48,540 --> 00:31:53,020
he's a shape and he's square and he just can't found out that he's gay yeah oh

639
00:31:53,020 --> 00:31:58,340
yeah yeah sure that is an intersectional on it I don't know what is I heard that

640
00:31:58,340 --> 00:32:03,420
I heard that from the TV. If that is an intersectional then I have no idea what

641
00:32:03,420 --> 00:32:07,980
that word means. Yeah if you're not talking about Spongebob being a shape

642
00:32:07,980 --> 00:32:13,500
and a color, I don't understand. A professor is like, "So you guys

643
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:16,840
understand the concept of intersectionality?" and I'm like, "Yeah I've

644
00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:28,220
seen Spongebob you stupid bitch you stupid Irish bitch number two he stabs

645
00:32:28,220 --> 00:32:32,920
Spongebob in the back that's true the audience doesn't see Pat's family until

646
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:37,840
season 2 episode 17 I'm with stupid already problematic in my eyes uh-huh

647
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:41,360
yeah Patrick's parents know their son is dumb but like a good friend Spongebob

648
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:44,800
tries to help by feigning idiocy hoping to make Patrick look smarter in

649
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:50,200
comparison. Instead, Patrick starts treating Spongebob like he is dumb. He and

650
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:53,880
his family openly laugh at and ridicule Spongebob. Without a second thought,

651
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:57,600
Patrick takes advantage of Spongebob's kindness and doesn't hesitate to treat

652
00:32:57,600 --> 00:33:01,560
him like garbage. Now what's really deep and profound about this episode is it's

653
00:33:01,560 --> 00:33:06,600
kind of like a meta storyline where we're basically invited to view our own

654
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:10,320
interactions with the character of Patrick Star through the lens of reality

655
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:11,520
within the show, you know?

656
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:14,840
'Cause we sort of, we, whenever Patrick Starr shows up

657
00:33:14,840 --> 00:33:17,440
on the TV, I start screaming at him.

658
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:19,360
And I start throwing things at my TV and saying,

659
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:23,900
you fat, shirtless, pink, stupid moron.

660
00:33:23,900 --> 00:33:26,120
And Patrick actually says those exact things

661
00:33:26,120 --> 00:33:27,400
to SpongeBob in this episode.

662
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:30,080
So it's kind of a dark reflection of our deepest selves.

663
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:33,000
- It's a dark reflection of Cameron's TV.

664
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:34,720
- It's a dark reflection of my behavior

665
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:36,120
toward my television.

666
00:33:36,120 --> 00:33:39,000
- In season two, episode 17, Patrick invites us

667
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:42,080
into his family's twisted world.

668
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:42,920
- Yeah.

669
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:47,460
- You know, it's 22 minutes of pure existential horror

670
00:33:47,460 --> 00:33:51,240
as we are forced to see not only a normal Patrick,

671
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:54,700
but also a girl Patrick and a boy Patrick.

672
00:33:54,700 --> 00:33:55,880
- Yeah, this is kind of like,

673
00:33:55,880 --> 00:33:57,620
this episode is pretty much the same

674
00:33:57,620 --> 00:33:59,640
as the strange thing about the Johnsons.

675
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:01,020
- Yeah.

676
00:34:01,020 --> 00:34:02,100
- It is.

677
00:34:02,100 --> 00:34:03,920
It's kind of exactly the same.

678
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:05,920
- I heard that this episode of SpongeBob

679
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:07,640
was inspired by this.

680
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:10,380
And that's also, and that's kind of subtextually,

681
00:34:10,380 --> 00:34:12,900
you can see the way that Patrick looks at his father.

682
00:34:12,900 --> 00:34:16,080
And you can see, well, why is Patrick not wearing a shirt,

683
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:17,160
but his father is?

684
00:34:17,160 --> 00:34:19,080
It's because his father is afraid

685
00:34:19,080 --> 00:34:21,280
of what'll happen if he takes his shirt off.

686
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:23,960
Notice that there's no scenes

687
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:25,560
with Patrick alone with his father.

688
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:28,520
That's 'cause they got cut out by the censorship board.

689
00:34:28,520 --> 00:34:30,160
- Yeah, that was actually,

690
00:34:30,160 --> 00:34:35,160
that was actually one of the other things.

691
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:39,260
It was a side thing on Squidward's Suicide.

692
00:34:39,260 --> 00:34:42,140
There was actually that, those scenes.

693
00:34:42,140 --> 00:34:44,140
- It's true, yeah.

694
00:34:44,140 --> 00:34:48,760
Originally, Patrick Star was supposed to be oriented

695
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:51,820
so that he had one leg and he was shaped like a pentagram

696
00:34:51,820 --> 00:34:53,380
due to his evil nature.

697
00:34:53,380 --> 00:34:54,220
- Yeah.

698
00:34:54,220 --> 00:34:56,980
But they were forced to invert him.

699
00:34:56,980 --> 00:34:57,820
- Well, if Patrick goes--

700
00:34:57,820 --> 00:34:59,380
- But then Eminem came along

701
00:34:59,380 --> 00:35:02,060
and everybody got weird about stuff

702
00:35:02,060 --> 00:35:03,540
and they had to change it.

703
00:35:03,540 --> 00:35:05,940
- Yeah, and Sandy Hook, Bird, Columbine.

704
00:35:05,940 --> 00:35:12,580
Yeah, and then Sandy Hook happened and they and the writers of Spongebob actually knew that and they predicted it Simpsons style

705
00:35:12,580 --> 00:35:14,100
Yeah

706
00:35:14,100 --> 00:35:18,140
So that patchy the pirate is always looking for they have this Andy Hook episode

707
00:35:18,140 --> 00:35:22,100
Where that's actually where Spongebob gets his holes from

708
00:35:22,100 --> 00:35:24,700
Yeah

709
00:35:24,700 --> 00:35:34,980
He gets completely Swiss cheesed yeah, they actually had to change the Patrick star character's name from Patrick Klebold

710
00:35:34,980 --> 00:35:44,980
3. He forces Spongebob to raise a baby scallop by himself. This I don't think is too bad.

711
00:35:44,980 --> 00:35:48,980
This is just a man's purpose.

712
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:56,980
Parenting can be tough, especially when one parent doesn't do their fair share. Spongebob learns this in Season 3, Episode 9, "Rock-a-Bye Bye-Valve."

713
00:35:56,980 --> 00:35:57,980
by Valve.

714
00:35:57,980 --> 00:36:00,980
Spongebob and Patrick find a baby scallop and decide to raise it.

715
00:36:00,980 --> 00:36:04,740
The scallop behaves a lot like a human baby, needing everything from feedings to diaper

716
00:36:04,740 --> 00:36:05,740
changing.

717
00:36:05,740 --> 00:36:10,300
While Spongebob proves himself a capable parent, Patrick spends his time watching TV, staying

718
00:36:10,300 --> 00:36:13,060
out late with friends, and eating ice cream and donuts.

719
00:36:13,060 --> 00:36:16,780
He promises to come home and help, giving Spongebob a day off, but he never shows.

720
00:36:16,780 --> 00:36:20,620
He's a bad adoptive dad and a selfish partner.

721
00:36:20,620 --> 00:36:23,980
You don't always have to take care of your kid.

722
00:36:23,980 --> 00:36:24,980
Yeah.

723
00:36:24,980 --> 00:36:25,980
Exactly.

724
00:36:25,980 --> 00:36:29,980
What if you want to eat ice cream and donuts and you want to hang out with your friends?

725
00:36:29,980 --> 00:36:31,980
What if your kid kind of sucks?

726
00:36:31,980 --> 00:36:32,980
Yeah.

727
00:36:32,980 --> 00:36:35,980
That's basically my plan.

728
00:36:35,980 --> 00:36:40,980
What if your kid is like, "Oh, Dad, I want to go see Hamilton."

729
00:36:40,980 --> 00:36:41,980
Yeah.

730
00:36:41,980 --> 00:36:42,980
Or something.

731
00:36:42,980 --> 00:36:48,980
Or like, "Oh, Dad, I need $50 to go hang out with my friends."

732
00:36:48,980 --> 00:36:50,980
Yeah, $50 to hang out with your friends.

733
00:36:50,980 --> 00:36:51,980
What are you doing, kid?

734
00:36:51,980 --> 00:36:52,980
Right?

735
00:36:52,980 --> 00:36:54,980
Are you renting your friends?

736
00:36:54,980 --> 00:36:55,820
- Friends?

737
00:36:55,820 --> 00:36:56,640
- Yeah.

738
00:36:56,640 --> 00:36:58,660
- You need $50 to hang out with your friends,

739
00:36:58,660 --> 00:36:59,800
what are you gonna do?

740
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:04,800
Oh, we're gonna go to the ThinkGeek

741
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:08,620
and we're gonna buy meme Funkos.

742
00:37:08,620 --> 00:37:11,840
- Yeah, yeah, I need 100 bucks to rent out a WeWork

743
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:13,600
for an hour so that me and my friends

744
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:15,500
can brainstorm our next app.

745
00:37:15,500 --> 00:37:16,340
- Exactly.

746
00:37:16,340 --> 00:37:17,160
- Shut up.

747
00:37:17,160 --> 00:37:18,900
- If your son does that, it's perfectly okay

748
00:37:18,900 --> 00:37:22,100
to close him into the pull-out couch

749
00:37:22,100 --> 00:37:24,220
and you sit on it and eat a tub of ice cream

750
00:37:24,220 --> 00:37:25,660
and you watch your TV.

751
00:37:25,660 --> 00:37:26,880
- Yeah, we have a trundle bed.

752
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:28,580
Our son is attached to the bottom

753
00:37:28,580 --> 00:37:31,140
and we only take him out when we need him.

754
00:37:31,140 --> 00:37:32,220
- Yeah, that's true.

755
00:37:32,220 --> 00:37:34,960
The thing is, if you're a husband

756
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:37,500
and your wife is at home taking care of the child

757
00:37:37,500 --> 00:37:40,440
and you're out eating ice cream with your friends,

758
00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:43,180
it's perfectly okay to call your wife and say,

759
00:37:43,180 --> 00:37:45,420
"Hey, I'm gonna come home and take care of the baby

760
00:37:45,420 --> 00:37:46,340
"and give you a day off."

761
00:37:46,340 --> 00:37:49,140
And even if you don't do it, that gives your wife hope,

762
00:37:49,140 --> 00:37:52,020
which is a powerful force and can push your wife

763
00:37:52,020 --> 00:38:13,980
to

764
00:38:13,980 --> 00:38:19,140
wearing michael rapaport's home attire yeah michael rapaport walking around his

765
00:38:19,140 --> 00:38:23,660
billion-dollar manhattan apartment in house shoes

766
00:38:23,660 --> 00:38:32,780
number I don't remember what number we're on we are the next number for for

767
00:38:32,780 --> 00:38:39,380
he steals Gary's spongebob's beloved pet that's okay to do if you like anybody

768
00:38:39,380 --> 00:38:42,860
like if you like your friends to hairless cats you're allowed to go to

769
00:38:42,860 --> 00:38:46,300
his house at night and sneak in through the window and take them out and play with them

770
00:38:46,300 --> 00:38:48,260
all night without your friend knowing.

771
00:38:48,260 --> 00:38:52,020
Even if he's not your friend, even if he's just a guy that you follow online.

772
00:38:52,020 --> 00:38:53,020
Yeah.

773
00:38:53,020 --> 00:38:54,020
No.

774
00:38:54,020 --> 00:38:55,020
It's perfectly legal.

775
00:38:55,020 --> 00:38:59,300
It's perfectly legal to triangulate his location based on locations mentioned in previous episodes.

776
00:38:59,300 --> 00:39:03,360
The reason is it's effectively legal because the statute of limitations on stealing pets

777
00:39:03,360 --> 00:39:04,360
is one minute.

778
00:39:04,360 --> 00:39:05,360
Yeah.

779
00:39:05,360 --> 00:39:06,360
So as long as you get...

780
00:39:06,360 --> 00:39:07,360
As long as you can hide for one minute.

781
00:39:07,360 --> 00:39:09,620
As long as you can hide for one minute.

782
00:39:09,620 --> 00:39:11,860
He just looked up at me after you said all that.

783
00:39:11,860 --> 00:39:12,860
And now he looks pissed.

784
00:39:12,860 --> 00:39:13,860
What did he say?

785
00:39:13,860 --> 00:39:14,860
He looks pissed.

786
00:39:14,860 --> 00:39:15,940
He doesn't speak English.

787
00:39:15,940 --> 00:39:16,940
He looks pissed.

788
00:39:16,940 --> 00:39:17,940
Yeah, but he's...

789
00:39:17,940 --> 00:39:18,940
He can't hear us.

790
00:39:18,940 --> 00:39:19,940
You're wearing headphones.

791
00:39:19,940 --> 00:39:20,940
He's emotional.

792
00:39:20,940 --> 00:39:21,940
Do you give your cat headphones to listen to us?

793
00:39:21,940 --> 00:39:22,940
He's not emotional.

794
00:39:22,940 --> 00:39:23,940
Yes.

795
00:39:23,940 --> 00:39:24,940
I have a splitter.

796
00:39:24,940 --> 00:39:26,020
You have a splitter?

797
00:39:26,020 --> 00:39:27,020
He likes to listen to music.

798
00:39:27,020 --> 00:39:28,020
What kind of music does he like?

799
00:39:28,020 --> 00:39:31,020
But it's perfectly okay to steal a pet.

800
00:39:31,020 --> 00:39:33,460
He listens to cat music.

801
00:39:33,460 --> 00:39:35,460
Yeah?

802
00:39:35,460 --> 00:39:36,460
Like what?

803
00:39:36,460 --> 00:39:37,460
I don't know.

804
00:39:37,460 --> 00:39:38,460
Cat Stevens?

805
00:39:38,460 --> 00:39:39,460
Oh, come on.

806
00:39:39,460 --> 00:39:40,460
Come on dude.

807
00:39:40,460 --> 00:39:41,960
Dude, that's a good one.

808
00:39:41,960 --> 00:39:43,900
Come on bro, you serious?

809
00:39:43,900 --> 00:39:45,300
We get paid to do this now.

810
00:39:45,300 --> 00:39:47,300
You can't just throw that out dude.

811
00:39:47,300 --> 00:39:50,500
You can't just say Cat Stevens man.

812
00:39:50,500 --> 00:39:52,420
You get paid.

813
00:39:52,420 --> 00:39:53,420
Like not a little bit.

814
00:39:53,420 --> 00:39:54,420
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

815
00:39:54,420 --> 00:39:58,260
Like a pretty good amount every month to do this and you say Cat Stevens dude.

816
00:39:58,260 --> 00:39:59,260
Yusuf Islam.

817
00:39:59,260 --> 00:40:00,260
There we go.

818
00:40:00,260 --> 00:40:02,100
Yeah, there we go.

819
00:40:02,100 --> 00:40:03,100
That's better.

820
00:40:03,100 --> 00:40:05,860
Uh huh, that's his new name.

821
00:40:05,860 --> 00:40:07,340
It's been his new name.

822
00:40:07,340 --> 00:40:11,820
In season 2 episode 9, appropriately... what are you saying?

823
00:40:11,820 --> 00:40:13,380
In season 2 episode 9...

824
00:40:13,380 --> 00:40:15,820
Cat Stephen changed his name to Yusuf Islam.

825
00:40:15,820 --> 00:40:16,820
Is that true?

826
00:40:16,820 --> 00:40:17,820
Yeah.

827
00:40:17,820 --> 00:40:20,020
Oh, I thought you were saying your cat's name was Yusuf Islam.

828
00:40:20,020 --> 00:40:23,460
Yeah, I'm changing my cat's name to Yusuf Islam.

829
00:40:23,460 --> 00:40:24,780
Yeah.

830
00:40:24,780 --> 00:40:29,620
Apparently titled "Dumped", Gary ignores... oh, appropriately titled "Dumped".

831
00:40:29,620 --> 00:40:30,620
Gary ignores Punchy Rob.

832
00:40:30,620 --> 00:40:31,620
Apparently...

833
00:40:31,620 --> 00:40:32,620
Apparently this one's called "Dumped".

834
00:40:32,620 --> 00:40:34,940
Apparently this one's called "Dumped".

835
00:40:34,940 --> 00:40:36,940
Hmm, okay, Steven Hillenburg.

836
00:40:36,940 --> 00:40:38,940
Okay, I see what, okay.

837
00:40:38,940 --> 00:40:39,940
Hmm?

838
00:40:39,940 --> 00:40:41,940
Gary ignores Spongebob to play with Patrick.

839
00:40:41,940 --> 00:40:43,940
Spongebob realizes this and feels crushed.

840
00:40:43,940 --> 00:40:47,940
Throughout the episode, Patrick doesn't hesitate to rub this in Spongebob's face.

841
00:40:47,940 --> 00:40:51,940
When Spongebob makes a plea to get the snail back, Patrick calls him pathetic.

842
00:40:51,940 --> 00:40:53,940
This is not the behavior of a true friend.

843
00:40:53,940 --> 00:40:56,940
Luckily, Gary eventually returns to his original owner.

844
00:40:56,940 --> 00:41:00,940
If Gary wants to go hang out with Patrick, then Gary can go hang out with Patrick.

845
00:41:00,940 --> 00:41:07,140
with Patrick. We're erasing the autonomy of this character Gary.

846
00:41:07,140 --> 00:41:10,780
Okay. But you got it, well you have to think, especially now with

847
00:41:10,780 --> 00:41:16,180
Spongebob's coming out, you know, is Gary homophobic for not wanting to hang out

848
00:41:16,180 --> 00:41:23,740
with Spongebob? Yeah and that's okay. Because Gary's a snail. Homophobia. Gary's a snail.

849
00:41:23,740 --> 00:41:27,900
No I'm saying Gary's a snail. That's what Cameron is saying. Cameron said that.

850
00:41:27,900 --> 00:41:33,140
Cameron said Gary is a snail. I didn't say that I would say it, but I didn't say it. Okay, okay

851
00:41:33,140 --> 00:41:37,180
But Gary's a snail. What does that have to do with him? Well, do you okay?

852
00:41:37,180 --> 00:41:38,740
Do you think the experiences of us?

853
00:41:38,740 --> 00:41:44,120
Do you think the experiences of a snail and a sponge are equal in this room in this realm of Bikini Bottom?

854
00:41:44,120 --> 00:41:47,820
Okay, there's a snail suffers a far greater

855
00:41:47,820 --> 00:41:50,460
axis of

856
00:41:50,460 --> 00:41:57,620
oppression many convergences of axes of oppression okay, and in this um in Bikini Bottom

857
00:41:57,620 --> 00:42:04,620
Where's the sponge? A sponge has it made, okay? You can work as a fry cook and you can afford a whole entire pineapple.

858
00:42:04,620 --> 00:42:11,620
Alright? A snail has to live in a little dog house or something. I don't know where Gary lives.

859
00:42:11,620 --> 00:42:16,620
How is Spongebob affording a whole house on a fry cook's salary?

860
00:42:16,620 --> 00:42:19,620
That's right. It's the new girl problem.

861
00:42:19,620 --> 00:42:22,620
Yeah, it's the friend's problem. It's the new girl problem.

862
00:42:22,620 --> 00:42:29,260
Tell me how unemployed little Spongebob with his colorful with his with his colorful patties stand is

863
00:42:29,260 --> 00:42:36,920
Affording that big-ass pineapple. He he's he's a something tells me inherited some money. Yeah, right

864
00:42:36,920 --> 00:42:42,940
Look, they barely work and he can afford a pineapple in bikini bottom

865
00:42:42,940 --> 00:42:48,380
I'm tired of these rich sponge gays pretending that they go through the same struggle as a snail

866
00:42:49,020 --> 00:42:50,860
Exactly, that's what I'm saying.

867
00:42:50,860 --> 00:42:52,540
A lowly snail.

868
00:42:52,540 --> 00:42:53,780
Yeah.

869
00:42:53,780 --> 00:42:56,220
Who kinda, you run into the Pluto problem,

870
00:42:56,220 --> 00:42:57,780
I would say, with Gary.

871
00:42:57,780 --> 00:43:00,680
Because why is he not, like, you know,

872
00:43:00,680 --> 00:43:02,060
why is he not autonomous?

873
00:43:02,060 --> 00:43:02,900
Why does he not have--

874
00:43:02,900 --> 00:43:04,600
Well, there aren't really any other

875
00:43:04,600 --> 00:43:06,620
autonomous snails in the show, so I don't think--

876
00:43:06,620 --> 00:43:10,240
The snails exist as like a low life form.

877
00:43:10,240 --> 00:43:12,660
Well, it's just like a cat in real life.

878
00:43:12,660 --> 00:43:14,180
But you gotta fuck it, you gotta,

879
00:43:14,180 --> 00:43:17,640
you gotta starfish that eats chocolate bars?

880
00:43:18,700 --> 00:43:22,380
No, he's, it's not, there's no, are there,

881
00:43:22,380 --> 00:43:24,860
is there one episode where Gary talks?

882
00:43:24,860 --> 00:43:28,080
There's one where he has,

883
00:43:28,080 --> 00:43:30,260
SpongeBob has a dream that Gary's British.

884
00:43:30,260 --> 00:43:33,340
Oh yeah, okay, that's what I'm thinking, it was a dream.

885
00:43:33,340 --> 00:43:36,180
All right, number the next one is,

886
00:43:36,180 --> 00:43:38,860
is he accuses SpongeBob of lying.

887
00:43:38,860 --> 00:43:41,520
That's very abusive to accuse someone of lying.

888
00:43:41,520 --> 00:43:42,420
That is true.

889
00:43:42,420 --> 00:43:45,980
Everything that happens in season two, episode seven,

890
00:43:45,980 --> 00:43:47,580
Life of Crime is Patrick's fault.

891
00:43:47,580 --> 00:43:51,180
he convinces fun job to steal a balloon than the two of them run away from home

892
00:43:51,180 --> 00:43:53,260
but the problems don't stop

893
00:43:53,260 --> 00:43:57,120
both of the friends of candy bars but patrick eats is and probably forgets

894
00:43:57,120 --> 00:43:59,680
immediately he accuses fun for the stealing is candy

895
00:43:59,680 --> 00:44:01,560
sponge bob ever the trooper

896
00:44:01,560 --> 00:44:05,220
offers pad is candy to make peace but patrick refuses threatening reports

897
00:44:05,220 --> 00:44:07,400
bundled sponge bob for balloon theft

898
00:44:07,400 --> 00:44:10,920
everything turns okay out okay because it's free balloon date but patrick acts

899
00:44:10,920 --> 00:44:13,400
incredibly disloyal

900
00:44:13,400 --> 00:44:16,320
this reminds me a little shake shack debacle

901
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:18,320
that's been going on in the news lately.

902
00:44:18,320 --> 00:44:20,320
This reminds me of every crime.

903
00:44:20,320 --> 00:44:22,320
This reminds me of crime.

904
00:44:22,320 --> 00:44:24,320
Yeah.

905
00:44:24,320 --> 00:44:26,320
This reminds me of crime.

906
00:44:26,320 --> 00:44:28,320
How fucking sick would it be if you commit a crime

907
00:44:28,320 --> 00:44:30,320
and you do a carjacking or something

908
00:44:30,320 --> 00:44:32,320
and then

909
00:44:32,320 --> 00:44:34,320
it turns out it was free car day.

910
00:44:34,320 --> 00:44:36,320
Oh it's free car day actually.

911
00:44:36,320 --> 00:44:38,320
Yeah.

912
00:44:38,320 --> 00:44:40,320
Yeah, you're welcome.

913
00:44:40,320 --> 00:44:42,320
It's free car day, you just take it.

914
00:44:42,320 --> 00:44:44,320
Dude, Jeffrey Epstein missed

915
00:44:44,320 --> 00:44:46,920
free pedophilia ring day by like one day.

916
00:44:46,920 --> 00:44:47,860
- Yeah.

917
00:44:47,860 --> 00:44:52,860
- Yeah, free, just free baby boy, baby boy butt day.

918
00:44:52,860 --> 00:44:55,100
He missed it.

919
00:44:55,100 --> 00:44:57,500
- Yeah, if he had just waited one day to get caught.

920
00:44:57,500 --> 00:44:58,340
- Yeah.

921
00:44:58,340 --> 00:44:59,460
- He would have been home free.

922
00:44:59,460 --> 00:45:01,360
- Yeah, Bill Cosby missed free pussy day

923
00:45:01,360 --> 00:45:03,780
by like a couple years.

924
00:45:03,780 --> 00:45:08,900
- This next one I really like.

925
00:45:08,900 --> 00:45:10,700
This is the one I wanted to get to.

926
00:45:10,700 --> 00:45:11,540
(laughing)

927
00:45:11,540 --> 00:45:13,580
- The fucking thumbnail for this.

928
00:45:13,580 --> 00:45:17,780
this is the next uh... i don't want to list is he hunts bunch bob like pray and

929
00:45:17,780 --> 00:45:22,420
they have like a just a terrifying like like uh... like a hidden frame in the

930
00:45:22,420 --> 00:45:23,740
show

931
00:45:23,740 --> 00:45:26,820
where his eyeballs are upside down

932
00:45:26,820 --> 00:45:31,260
projects as a resident is clinging to the ceiling holding a jellies old man

933
00:45:31,260 --> 00:45:34,580
of these days on the internet ready to get started as i said i was going to

934
00:45:34,580 --> 00:45:39,560
write down what what's going on and they look upside down here

935
00:45:39,560 --> 00:45:43,720
Whoa, if you look at the picture upside down, it looks like he has a mustache from his eyebrows.

936
00:45:43,720 --> 00:45:44,840
Whoa.

937
00:45:44,840 --> 00:45:49,820
During season one episode nine, Nature Pants, SpongeBob decides he wants to live with the jellyfish.

938
00:45:49,820 --> 00:45:51,160
Patrick doesn't take this well though.

939
00:45:51,160 --> 00:45:56,120
Initially, he cries, begging SpongeBob to say, and when that doesn't work, Patrick decides to capture him as a trophy.

940
00:45:56,120 --> 00:45:58,080
Patrick cunts SpongeBob like an animal.

941
00:45:58,080 --> 00:45:59,920
I think he is an animal.

942
00:45:59,920 --> 00:46:01,760
Attacking him and setting traps.

943
00:46:01,760 --> 00:46:06,000
While Patrick eventually gives up the hunt, his actions get SpongeBob stung by all the jellyfish.

944
00:46:07,240 --> 00:46:10,400
I hate- we all know that one guy who hunts you like prey.

945
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:14,760
We all know that one guy that gets you stung by all the jellyfish.

946
00:46:14,760 --> 00:46:17,200
Yes he hunts me like prey but we've been friends for so long.

947
00:46:17,200 --> 00:46:20,480
Well, I mean he's never hunted me like prey.

948
00:46:20,480 --> 00:46:23,720
You know, he's always been good to me but he has hunted some of my friends like prey.

949
00:46:23,720 --> 00:46:25,000
So I still hang out with him.

950
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:26,920
He goes after them like an animal.

951
00:46:26,920 --> 00:46:27,920
Yeah.

952
00:46:27,920 --> 00:46:29,720
Attacking them and setting traps.

953
00:46:29,720 --> 00:46:33,440
Yes his eyeballs are upside down and yeah he hunts me with a jellyfish net.

954
00:46:33,440 --> 00:46:35,200
He's a giant starfish.

955
00:46:35,200 --> 00:46:37,060
And in the end, yeah, I got stung.

956
00:46:37,060 --> 00:46:39,160
But that's kind of the cost of friendship.

957
00:46:39,160 --> 00:46:40,160
Is it functional?

958
00:46:40,160 --> 00:46:41,160
No.

959
00:46:41,160 --> 00:46:44,080
But what family is?

960
00:46:44,080 --> 00:46:46,160
Hunting Spongebob, I...

961
00:46:46,160 --> 00:46:47,160
I would like to hunt Spongebob.

962
00:46:47,160 --> 00:46:49,280
I would like to hunt Spongebob like prey.

963
00:46:49,280 --> 00:46:50,640
Yeah, I would too.

964
00:46:50,640 --> 00:46:51,640
I'd like to see...

965
00:46:51,640 --> 00:46:54,280
I'd like to get me and him alone on an island, okay?

966
00:46:54,280 --> 00:46:56,240
I've got an AR-15.

967
00:46:56,240 --> 00:46:57,240
He's got nothing, alright?

968
00:46:57,240 --> 00:46:59,380
He doesn't even have his little fry cook outfit.

969
00:46:59,380 --> 00:47:00,560
He's bare naked.

970
00:47:00,560 --> 00:47:02,080
He's running around the island, okay?

971
00:47:02,080 --> 00:47:04,860
I am using my tracking abilities

972
00:47:04,860 --> 00:47:08,260
and I'm tracking his bean-shaped footsteps.

973
00:47:08,260 --> 00:47:11,980
And I'm going after him, and if I see him,

974
00:47:11,980 --> 00:47:14,600
I'm opening fire and I'm filling those holes.

975
00:47:14,600 --> 00:47:16,800
I'm filling those holes with lead.

976
00:47:16,800 --> 00:47:19,360
- Straight up, if I saw a SpongeBob in real life,

977
00:47:19,360 --> 00:47:21,600
I would immediately open fire.

978
00:47:21,600 --> 00:47:23,000
- Yeah. - Yeah.

979
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:26,200
Yeah, I'm always open carrying, so I would open fire.

980
00:47:26,200 --> 00:47:29,520
I'm always open carrying a Barrett .50 caliber rifle.

981
00:47:29,520 --> 00:47:30,820
- Exactly. - And it has

982
00:47:30,820 --> 00:47:35,820
thermal variable zoom scope. So what I might do is I, you know, and also guns,

983
00:47:35,820 --> 00:47:38,660
bullets work differently through water. Yeah.

984
00:47:38,660 --> 00:47:40,740
So I'd have to account for like, well yeah,

985
00:47:40,740 --> 00:47:42,500
I would loss of velocity and stuff,

986
00:47:42,500 --> 00:47:45,980
but I would activate my stopping power rounds first. Exactly.

987
00:47:45,980 --> 00:47:50,380
I would definitely put FMJ and a sleight of hand as a couple of my perks.

988
00:47:50,380 --> 00:47:54,100
I would have like a P90 or maybe an MP7 as my, as my sidearm.

989
00:47:54,100 --> 00:47:56,980
I would have an advanced UIV up. Of course.

990
00:47:57,700 --> 00:48:01,540
I'm kind of like a, I'm kind of like a berserker.

991
00:48:01,540 --> 00:48:04,220
I would go in with the riot shield.

992
00:48:04,220 --> 00:48:05,160
- Oh nice.

993
00:48:05,160 --> 00:48:07,960
- Yeah, 'cause berserkers love shields, you fucking idiot.

994
00:48:07,960 --> 00:48:08,800
- Yeah, go talk to your cat again.

995
00:48:08,800 --> 00:48:09,620
- No, I have a knife, I have a knife.

996
00:48:09,620 --> 00:48:11,160
- You're thinking of a tank.

997
00:48:11,160 --> 00:48:12,140
You're thinking of a tank.

998
00:48:12,140 --> 00:48:14,260
- You're thinking of a guy with a shield.

999
00:48:14,260 --> 00:48:15,180
You're thinking of tanking.

1000
00:48:15,180 --> 00:48:16,020
- All right, all right.

1001
00:48:16,020 --> 00:48:16,860
- No, what I would do is basically--

1002
00:48:16,860 --> 00:48:19,300
- I didn't know the terminology, so I'm sorry.

1003
00:48:19,300 --> 00:48:21,500
- I would use my DDS plus plus,

1004
00:48:21,500 --> 00:48:23,220
my dragon dagger poison plus plus.

1005
00:48:23,220 --> 00:48:24,500
- Yeah, your dick does something.

1006
00:48:24,500 --> 00:48:26,300
- No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1007
00:48:26,300 --> 00:48:27,140
I would run up to him.

1008
00:48:27,140 --> 00:48:29,860
I'd hit him with my full special attack three times.

1009
00:48:29,860 --> 00:48:30,860
And that's what you would do.

1010
00:48:30,860 --> 00:48:38,060
And then basically I would mount his nose on my shower door and then use it like a dildo.

1011
00:48:38,060 --> 00:48:42,540
Yeah, how gay are you really now, SpongeBob?

1012
00:48:42,540 --> 00:48:44,940
You know, you want me to send this photo to Nickelodeon?

1013
00:48:44,940 --> 00:48:46,820
I don't think so.

1014
00:48:46,820 --> 00:48:49,500
It's okay, he'll grow back.

1015
00:48:49,500 --> 00:48:50,500
That's true.

1016
00:48:50,500 --> 00:48:55,240
That's the horrible thing about him, is that if you mounted his head, it would grow into

1017
00:48:55,240 --> 00:48:56,500
a new SpongeBob.

1018
00:48:56,500 --> 00:49:02,340
Yeah, because Spongebob is all brain or something, or he's all, he's a lizard or

1019
00:49:02,340 --> 00:49:06,900
I don't know how it works. He's a lizard. He's actually secretly a yellow lizard and

1020
00:49:06,900 --> 00:49:10,740
basically what he would do, basically what he would do is he would he would

1021
00:49:10,740 --> 00:49:18,140
grow into a monster off of your wall. If you hung him like a singing fish,

1022
00:49:18,140 --> 00:49:21,860
eventually he would he would come back and he would enact his revenge. The only

1023
00:49:21,860 --> 00:49:25,620
way to actually permanently destroy him is you have to, you got to hit him with

1024
00:49:25,620 --> 00:49:29,340
with the degreaser from Team Fortress 2.

1025
00:49:29,340 --> 00:49:30,660
You gotta burn him to a crisp.

1026
00:49:30,660 --> 00:49:32,780
And then with the fire axe.

1027
00:49:32,780 --> 00:49:33,620
- That's true.

1028
00:49:33,620 --> 00:49:35,500
- He's completely unkillable.

1029
00:49:35,500 --> 00:49:36,320
- Yeah.

1030
00:49:36,320 --> 00:49:37,160
- He's like, every time you think he's dead,

1031
00:49:37,160 --> 00:49:38,660
he Michael Myers' out of it.

1032
00:49:38,660 --> 00:49:40,100
- Yeah, you can kill him by burning him,

1033
00:49:40,100 --> 00:49:41,580
but he lives underwater.

1034
00:49:41,580 --> 00:49:42,420
All right?

1035
00:49:42,420 --> 00:49:43,260
- Exactly.

1036
00:49:43,260 --> 00:49:44,080
- If you think about,

1037
00:49:44,080 --> 00:49:44,920
think back to the SpongeBob movie,

1038
00:49:44,920 --> 00:49:47,580
they almost killed him by shining light on him.

1039
00:49:47,580 --> 00:49:49,820
Dude, is he a vampire?

1040
00:49:49,820 --> 00:49:50,940
- Oh, what?

1041
00:49:50,940 --> 00:49:52,340
- Yeah, that's a really good point.

1042
00:49:52,340 --> 00:49:54,700
He does, he gets dried out easily like a vampire.

1043
00:49:54,700 --> 00:50:00,840
Yeah, I mean that's... I'm trying to think of more stuff that's like a vampire but I can't

1044
00:50:00,840 --> 00:50:07,840
so I think that might be it. Yeah. He says Nosferatu one time. He does. Oh my god, that's

1045
00:50:07,840 --> 00:50:15,020
his cousin. Oh my god, he forgot, that episode he just forgot that he invited his cousin over.

1046
00:50:15,020 --> 00:50:19,860
And Nosferatu is an anagram for Spongebob Squarepants. That's true. Yeah, it's true.

1047
00:50:19,860 --> 00:50:21,460
They have the same letters.

1048
00:50:21,460 --> 00:50:24,060
It's the same, it uses all the same letters.

1049
00:50:24,060 --> 00:50:25,060
Uh huh.

1050
00:50:25,060 --> 00:50:27,060
The ones from the alphabet.

1051
00:50:27,060 --> 00:50:28,060
Exactly.

1052
00:50:28,060 --> 00:50:30,860
It uses, it comes from the same letter pool.

1053
00:50:30,860 --> 00:50:34,860
It comes from the same letter pool, exactly.

1054
00:50:34,860 --> 00:50:36,500
Yeah.

1055
00:50:36,500 --> 00:50:37,500
Next one.

1056
00:50:37,500 --> 00:50:39,100
He keeps an embarrassing photo of Spongebob.

1057
00:50:39,100 --> 00:50:41,860
I don't know, I don't think, I keep an embarrassing photo of both of you.

1058
00:50:41,860 --> 00:50:42,860
Yeah.

1059
00:50:42,860 --> 00:50:43,860
No.

1060
00:50:43,860 --> 00:50:44,860
Yeah.

1061
00:50:44,860 --> 00:50:48,500
I have a photo, I have a photo of Patrick riding a mechanical bull but just one of the

1062
00:50:48,500 --> 00:50:55,600
horns and then no photo of Cameron wearing a dress upside down no I have my

1063
00:50:55,600 --> 00:50:58,860
favorite picture I have a Patrick is the one where he's halfway into a window

1064
00:50:58,860 --> 00:51:07,740
climb that is good yeah oh that same that same night that was a when Caleb

1065
00:51:07,740 --> 00:51:13,220

1066
00:51:13,220 --> 00:51:17,340
a video of you coming out of the body in there you got half of your body in there

1067
00:51:17,340 --> 00:51:19,340
I don't remember I was so fucked up for that show.

1068
00:51:19,340 --> 00:51:21,840
Yeah, me too. It was not good.

1069
00:51:21,840 --> 00:51:27,840
Patrick keeps a secret in season 2 episode 15, the secret box.

1070
00:51:27,840 --> 00:51:29,340
Yeah, you think?

1071
00:51:29,340 --> 00:51:34,340
Huh? You fucking... it's in the name of the episode. Of course he keeps a secret.

1072
00:51:34,340 --> 00:51:34,840
That's...

1073
00:51:34,840 --> 00:51:36,840
But this author is very stupid.

1074
00:51:36,840 --> 00:51:37,840
Yeah.

1075
00:51:37,840 --> 00:51:39,840
Wait, let's skip to the next one because I think we can really...

1076
00:51:39,840 --> 00:51:41,340
You're sounding like Patrick right now, Cam.

1077
00:51:41,340 --> 00:51:43,840
We can really speak on this.

1078
00:51:43,840 --> 00:51:44,840
That's true.

1079
00:51:44,840 --> 00:51:48,840
He refuses to share a toy with SpongeBob.

1080
00:51:48,840 --> 00:51:53,160
okay what the hell is wrong with this i'm i'm i'm flipping on you know i'm i'm

1081
00:51:53,160 --> 00:51:57,240

1082
00:51:57,240 --> 00:52:02,120
patrick you're scum okay if you won't share your rescue hero with your friend

1083
00:52:02,120 --> 00:52:08,120
you're you're worse than um you're worse than donald trump and i don't say that lightly

1084
00:52:08,120 --> 00:52:13,800
exactly you are like yeah hitler never shared his toys either

1085
00:52:15,720 --> 00:52:16,220
Yeah.

1086
00:52:16,220 --> 00:52:17,220
It's true.

1087
00:52:17,220 --> 00:52:22,720
Uh, when Mr. Krabs makes a kids meal toy, he doesn't exactly put in maximum effort.

1088
00:52:22,720 --> 00:52:24,720
So it sounds like Mr. Krabs is not...

1089
00:52:24,720 --> 00:52:27,220
Yeah, do they even... hold on, hold on.

1090
00:52:27,220 --> 00:52:30,220
Do they even give out toys at the Krabby Patty?

1091
00:52:30,220 --> 00:52:32,720
Not anymore, not after this one.

1092
00:52:32,720 --> 00:52:36,220
Not after season 7, episode 6, "Yours, Mine, and Mine."

1093
00:52:36,220 --> 00:52:40,220
When Mr. Krabs shoves straws into a Krabby Patty and calls it a day.

1094
00:52:40,220 --> 00:52:42,220
That's the toy they're freaking out over?

1095
00:52:42,220 --> 00:52:44,720
And also, what a piss poor excuse for a toy.

1096
00:52:44,720 --> 00:52:45,780
- Yeah, come on.

1097
00:52:45,780 --> 00:52:47,100
- It's literally food.

1098
00:52:47,100 --> 00:52:47,940
- Horrible.

1099
00:52:47,940 --> 00:52:50,900
- Yeah, make it something that I can dress up

1100
00:52:50,900 --> 00:52:52,320
and then undress.

1101
00:52:52,320 --> 00:52:53,160
- Yeah.

1102
00:52:53,160 --> 00:52:54,000
- You know what I mean?

1103
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:57,140
Draw a little something for daddy on the hamburger.

1104
00:52:57,140 --> 00:52:57,980
- Exactly.

1105
00:52:57,980 --> 00:52:58,800
- With ketchup.

1106
00:52:58,800 --> 00:52:59,640
- Exactly.

1107
00:52:59,640 --> 00:53:02,120
- And then give it to me for free.

1108
00:53:02,120 --> 00:53:02,960
- Yeah.

1109
00:53:02,960 --> 00:53:03,800
- And then don't bother me.

1110
00:53:03,800 --> 00:53:07,980
- Sexual things about toys that are only for parents

1111
00:53:07,980 --> 00:53:10,460
to understand, the kids won't understand when they see it.

1112
00:53:10,460 --> 00:53:12,260
When they take off Ken's pants

1113
00:53:12,260 --> 00:53:14,520
and he has a giant 15 inch penis,

1114
00:53:14,520 --> 00:53:17,520
The kids don't understand it, but it's put in there,

1115
00:53:17,520 --> 00:53:20,360
they put it in there for the parents to look at and play with.

1116
00:53:20,360 --> 00:53:22,480
- That's just one of those things for parents

1117
00:53:22,480 --> 00:53:24,860
that they sit there and they go hee hee hee.

1118
00:53:24,860 --> 00:53:28,400
- Yeah, it even has some jokes for parents.

1119
00:53:28,400 --> 00:53:31,360
- Yeah, kids toys even have some jokes for parents

1120
00:53:31,360 --> 00:53:32,480
that go hee hee hee.

1121
00:53:32,480 --> 00:53:35,000
- Yeah, when I was a kid, I used to wake up every morning

1122
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:37,480
on Christmas, we had Christmas every single day,

1123
00:53:37,480 --> 00:53:40,280
I would open up a bionicle and I'd say,

1124
00:53:40,280 --> 00:53:44,300
Mom, Father, I gotta go to the bathroom for 30 minutes.

1125
00:53:44,300 --> 00:53:46,140
and I would take my bionicle in,

1126
00:53:46,140 --> 00:53:47,900
I would experiment with its body,

1127
00:53:47,900 --> 00:53:50,660
I would find places to hide things,

1128
00:53:50,660 --> 00:53:53,220
I would find places to hide it on me,

1129
00:53:53,220 --> 00:53:54,220
and then I would come out

1130
00:53:54,220 --> 00:53:56,700
and I'd be ready for Christmas again.

1131
00:53:56,700 --> 00:53:57,520
- Yeah.

1132
00:53:57,520 --> 00:53:58,660
- Christmas the day, the next day,

1133
00:53:58,660 --> 00:54:00,820
'cause you did it pretty much the whole day.

1134
00:54:00,820 --> 00:54:02,420
- Yeah, basically if I was a president,

1135
00:54:02,420 --> 00:54:04,000
it'd be Christmas every day.

1136
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:06,100
Hanukkah is still just once a year though.

1137
00:54:06,100 --> 00:54:09,380
But Christmas every single day.

1138
00:54:09,380 --> 00:54:10,640
- Yeah.

1139
00:54:10,640 --> 00:54:14,380
- Another joke they put in toys for parents

1140
00:54:14,380 --> 00:54:15,640
is in the Jack in the Box,

1141
00:54:15,640 --> 00:54:18,580
if you keep winding it after it already pops up,

1142
00:54:18,580 --> 00:54:20,180
it actually pops up a little more

1143
00:54:20,180 --> 00:54:21,560
and you can see its dick.

1144
00:54:21,560 --> 00:54:23,720
(laughing)

1145
00:54:23,720 --> 00:54:25,160
- It's true. - But kids will get bored,

1146
00:54:25,160 --> 00:54:27,220
they won't wind up the Jack in the Box enough

1147
00:54:27,220 --> 00:54:28,600
to see that joke.

1148
00:54:28,600 --> 00:54:30,000
- Yeah. - Yeah.

1149
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:32,140
- There's actually-- - And with the box,

1150
00:54:32,140 --> 00:54:36,400
it has the different shapes that the shapes go in.

1151
00:54:36,400 --> 00:54:38,580
On the bottom, there's actually one that's circular,

1152
00:54:38,580 --> 00:54:40,280
so you know what that means.

1153
00:54:40,280 --> 00:54:41,120
- Yeah, exactly.

1154
00:54:41,120 --> 00:54:42,600
- Like one on the bottom and it's a circle.

1155
00:54:42,600 --> 00:54:45,240
- What do you think the box refers to in Jack in the Box?

1156
00:54:45,240 --> 00:54:46,480
- That's right, yeah.

1157
00:54:46,480 --> 00:54:48,760
Yeah, jack in a box?

1158
00:54:48,760 --> 00:54:49,720
- Yeah.

1159
00:54:49,720 --> 00:54:51,520
- Jacking what into a box?

1160
00:54:51,520 --> 00:54:52,560
- Pop goes the weasel?

1161
00:54:52,560 --> 00:54:54,360
What do you think that means?

1162
00:54:54,360 --> 00:54:55,560
- What do you think the weasel is?

1163
00:54:55,560 --> 00:54:56,940
What you're supposed to do is you're supposed to put

1164
00:54:56,940 --> 00:54:59,880
the jack in the box and the weasel next to each other

1165
00:54:59,880 --> 00:55:02,080
and let the weasel pop into the box.

1166
00:55:02,080 --> 00:55:02,920
- Yep.

1167
00:55:02,920 --> 00:55:04,520
- Let the weasel jack into the box.

1168
00:55:04,520 --> 00:55:06,560
- Exactly. - That's true.

1169
00:55:06,560 --> 00:55:07,960
- Here's what you gotta do.

1170
00:55:07,960 --> 00:55:09,680
- And basically, yeah, you can organize,

1171
00:55:09,680 --> 00:55:13,240
You can mix so many toys together at their various,

1172
00:55:13,240 --> 00:55:15,300
where their penises and vaginas should be

1173
00:55:15,300 --> 00:55:18,880
until they form sort of like a Power Rangers,

1174
00:55:18,880 --> 00:55:21,760
like each one of them is a different piece.

1175
00:55:21,760 --> 00:55:23,160
- A sexual zord.

1176
00:55:23,160 --> 00:55:24,680
- A sexual zord, exactly.

1177
00:55:24,680 --> 00:55:26,320
- Sexual zord.

1178
00:55:26,320 --> 00:55:27,800
- Yeah.

1179
00:55:27,800 --> 00:55:29,240
It's pretty sick.

1180
00:55:29,240 --> 00:55:32,560
- Yeah, and that's just, they do that for the parents.

1181
00:55:32,560 --> 00:55:34,520
- Yeah, and that's one of the jokes for the parents.

1182
00:55:34,520 --> 00:55:36,640
- Yeah, a sex zord.

1183
00:55:39,640 --> 00:55:40,560
yeah

1184
00:55:40,560 --> 00:55:43,220
yeah that's what me

1185
00:55:43,220 --> 00:55:45,520

00:55:59,200 --> 00:56:01,960
next on people little sponge bob's job

1195
00:56:01,960 --> 00:56:06,400
and kill spectators of the process

1196
00:56:06,400 --> 00:56:09,320
I remember this one. Season 2, episode 19, the Fry Cook Games.

1197
00:56:09,320 --> 00:56:12,760
SpongeBob gets the honor of competing in the titular games, and Patrick...

1198
00:56:12,760 --> 00:56:15,560
Oh, there's a little joke for the... for the adult.

1199
00:56:15,560 --> 00:56:17,160
- What? Titular? - Titular, yeah.

1200
00:56:17,160 --> 00:56:20,240
- Yeah. - And Patrick, the ranker, actually has jokes for the parents, too.

1201
00:56:20,240 --> 00:56:21,040
- That's true. - Yeah.

1202
00:56:21,040 --> 00:56:24,240
Patrick isn't exactly supportive. Instead, he argues with his friends,

1203
00:56:24,240 --> 00:56:26,720
deriding the competition and the occupation.

1204
00:56:26,720 --> 00:56:29,600
SpongeBob defends his job, but Patrick continues to belittle him

1205
00:56:29,600 --> 00:56:31,840
and eventually competes for the opposing team.

1206
00:56:31,840 --> 00:56:34,400
Patrick's pettiness ends up killing a whole lot of people.

1207
00:56:34,400 --> 00:56:37,720
Spongebob competes for the opposing team we just learned during

1208
00:56:37,720 --> 00:56:44,660
And nice during the games he throws hot oil on a bunch of fish turning them into fish sticks

1209
00:56:44,660 --> 00:56:49,780
So they're sold there then sold as food to other fish Wow you know there's so many things wrong with this

1210
00:56:49,780 --> 00:56:54,840
That's probably this is probably like this is by first of all why didn't they lead with this one? Yeah?

1211
00:56:54,840 --> 00:57:04,040
I also I like I like that they have that this one is he belittles spongebob's job and kills spectators

1212
00:57:04,040 --> 00:57:10,120
right like yeah why even include the belittling spongebob's job in this one

1213
00:57:10,120 --> 00:57:17,680
yeah yeah on the way up to suite 135 Stephen Paddock was actually very rude

1214
00:57:17,680 --> 00:57:23,440
to a cleaning lady and belittled her job and then he did something I think I

1215
00:57:23,440 --> 00:57:29,840
don't know but he turned all those country music fans into fish sticks

1216
00:57:30,440 --> 00:57:42,640
yeah yeah do you want the fry cook games that day yeah yeah yeah no that's uh I

1217
00:57:42,640 --> 00:57:46,400
guess the most messed up part of this wait a second selling to other people

1218
00:57:46,400 --> 00:57:52,760
Steve Steven Paddock Steven Patrick oh my god

1219
00:57:52,760 --> 00:57:59,200
even oh my god we have to delete even Hillenburg Patrick his middle name was

1220
00:57:59,200 --> 00:58:08,640
was was Hillenburg is what people tell you yeah he actually in his manifesto he

1221
00:58:08,640 --> 00:58:13,640
said he based the mass shooting off season 2 episode 19 of Spongebob yeah

1222
00:58:13,640 --> 00:58:18,880
fry cook games yeah and he was hoping and he and he was really surprised by

1223
00:58:18,880 --> 00:58:22,680
everybody's reaction he thought they would just start selling all the people

1224
00:58:22,680 --> 00:58:27,560
he fish sticked yeah he thought the music would go on well I like the music

1225
00:58:27,560 --> 00:58:33,180
stop come on I thought that it was gonna be Spongebob playing the the Bikini

1226
00:58:33,180 --> 00:58:42,020
Bottom Bowl song but no it was some fucking hillbillies yeah I thought it

1227
00:58:42,020 --> 00:58:49,180
was gonna be sweet victory but yeah yeah nope nope not not for me apparently yeah

1228
00:58:49,180 --> 00:58:53,720
yeah not for me old Stephen Paddock nothing ever goes right nothing goes

1229
00:58:53,720 --> 00:58:55,240
That was great for me.

1230
00:58:55,240 --> 00:58:57,880
Yeah.

1231
00:58:57,880 --> 00:58:59,560
Just a day in the life.

1232
00:58:59,560 --> 00:59:01,440
Just another day as Steven Paddock.

1233
00:59:01,440 --> 00:59:02,760
Just everything fucking up.

1234
00:59:02,760 --> 00:59:03,320
Oh, great.

1235
00:59:03,320 --> 00:59:04,880
I just stubbed my toe.

1236
00:59:04,880 --> 00:59:06,400
Awesome.

1237
00:59:06,400 --> 00:59:07,080
Yeah.

1238
00:59:07,080 --> 00:59:07,600
Awesome.

1239
00:59:07,600 --> 00:59:09,320
No, this is awesome.

1240
00:59:09,320 --> 00:59:09,720
Oh, no.

1241
00:59:09,720 --> 00:59:10,400
I like this.

1242
00:59:10,400 --> 00:59:11,480
I actually-- I like this.

1243
00:59:11,480 --> 00:59:12,120
Oh, great.

1244
00:59:12,120 --> 00:59:12,620
Great.

1245
00:59:12,620 --> 00:59:16,360
I just started a Halo Slayer game, and I got disconnected.

1246
00:59:16,360 --> 00:59:16,960
Awesome.

1247
00:59:16,960 --> 00:59:17,600
No, no.

1248
00:59:17,600 --> 00:59:18,800
This is actually good for me.

1249
00:59:18,800 --> 00:59:19,300
Yeah, no.

1250
00:59:19,300 --> 00:59:20,040
Normal world.

1251
00:59:20,040 --> 00:59:20,400
Yeah, normal world.

1252
00:59:20,400 --> 00:59:21,000
You know what?

1253
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:22,680
We deserve Donald Trump.

1254
00:59:22,680 --> 00:59:31,760
know what I'll say me Steven Paddock I'll say we deserve him yeah it's normal

1255
00:59:31,760 --> 00:59:37,780
god this nor this world so normal yeah and I've been in my car and mentally be

1256
00:59:37,780 --> 00:59:43,280
great great I clogged the hotel toilet now sorry I'm gonna come back to come up

1257
00:59:43,280 --> 00:59:45,320
Nobody can find out about this.

1258
00:59:45,320 --> 00:59:51,200
I have to do something.

1259
00:59:51,200 --> 00:59:55,480
I have to barricade the door. Oh no, the window was open. Who

1260
00:59:55,480 --> 00:59:56,040
saw?

1261
00:59:56,040 --> 01:00:04,400
Yeah, he was just he was just jacking off to hotel porn with

1262
01:00:04,400 --> 01:00:07,920
the window open and he was like, Oh, fuck everybody saw.

1263
01:00:10,640 --> 01:00:16,800
Yeah, good thing I brought those Hillary Duff photos of her blowing her fiance.

1264
01:00:16,800 --> 01:00:17,800
Yeah.

1265
01:00:17,800 --> 01:00:19,920
I have to erase all evidence of this.

1266
01:00:19,920 --> 01:00:20,920
Yeah.

1267
01:00:20,920 --> 01:00:24,400
Good thing I brought all these weapons I was holding for my friend Hillary Clinton.

1268
01:00:24,400 --> 01:00:25,400
Yeah.

1269
01:00:25,400 --> 01:00:30,320
Yeah, good thing I have these 15 CIA agents in the room with me.

1270
01:00:30,320 --> 01:00:31,320
Yeah.

1271
01:00:31,320 --> 01:00:34,480
Who are, yeah.

1272
01:00:34,480 --> 01:00:35,480
Next one.

1273
01:00:35,480 --> 01:00:38,120
He refuses to take an ill SpongeBob to the hospital.

1274
01:00:38,120 --> 01:00:39,120
I would too.

1275
01:00:39,120 --> 01:00:45,920
Slow to admit when he feels unwell, knows he needs to visit the doctor when he realizes he has the suds.

1276
01:00:45,920 --> 01:00:50,320
Spongebob predicted the future, dude.

1277
01:00:50,320 --> 01:00:51,920
Yeah, we all have the suds.

1278
01:00:51,920 --> 01:00:54,320
Season 1, episode 15, "Suds."

1279
01:00:54,320 --> 01:00:57,820
The bloated Sponge tries to get medical care before encountering Patrick.

1280
01:00:57,820 --> 01:00:59,920
Of course, things go terribly wrong.

1281
01:00:59,920 --> 01:01:03,220
First, Patrick scares Spongebob into not going into the hospital at all.

1282
01:01:03,220 --> 01:01:06,520
Then he plays doctor, subjecting his pal to unhelpful and harmful treatments.

1283
01:01:06,520 --> 01:01:09,800
When Sandy tries to correct Patrick, he lashes out and decides to run.

1284
01:01:09,800 --> 01:01:13,960
SpongeBob receives treatment eventually, but Patrick cares more about his pride than his friend's health.

1285
01:01:13,960 --> 01:01:17,480
Suds is, um, Sudden Unfint Death Syndrome.

1286
01:01:17,480 --> 01:01:19,480
[laughter]

1287
01:01:19,480 --> 01:01:22,120
It is a little close to SIDS.

1288
01:01:22,120 --> 01:01:26,280
Yeah. I think this one was supposed to be an allegory.

1289
01:01:26,280 --> 01:01:30,280
This episode was supposed to be like a social commentary.

1290
01:01:30,280 --> 01:01:31,720
Yeah. On the suds?

1291
01:01:31,720 --> 01:01:33,720
On the, on, on suds.

1292
01:01:33,720 --> 01:01:35,720
Yeah, and Patrick represents vaccines.

1293
01:01:35,720 --> 01:01:42,680
Yeah in this version. Yeah and each point of his prickly form is a kind of needle.

1294
01:01:42,680 --> 01:01:47,480
Exactly. Locked and loaded with small amounts of things like the H1N1 virus or polio

1295
01:01:47,480 --> 01:01:54,040
which are expected to cure your child but instead give them a new kind of AIDS called SIDS.

1296
01:01:54,040 --> 01:02:03,400
Yeah that's true. SIDS is super super immunodeficiency syndrome. It's the upgraded

1297
01:02:03,400 --> 01:02:08,840
Instead of average immunodeficiency. Yeah, a little. Which is what AIDS is. A little. A little bit.

1298
01:02:08,840 --> 01:02:16,360
Yeah. This is also how they, this is also coincidentally how they cure AIDS is they

1299
01:02:16,360 --> 01:02:22,920
just plug all your holes with cork. That's what they do. Yeah. They're like, "Just don't,

1300
01:02:22,920 --> 01:02:30,360
just don't, you know, you'll be fine." Yeah, that's what, that's Bubble Boy is about.

1301
01:02:31,080 --> 01:02:31,580
Yeah.

1302
01:02:31,580 --> 01:02:32,420
He got the suds.

1303
01:02:32,420 --> 01:02:35,160
Uh, next one.

1304
01:02:35,160 --> 01:02:36,800
He becomes a vicious tyrant.

1305
01:02:36,800 --> 01:02:38,720
He does.

1306
01:02:38,720 --> 01:02:40,680
He just looks like a king to me.

1307
01:02:40,680 --> 01:02:41,500
Yeah.

1308
01:02:41,500 --> 01:02:45,240
In season 4, episode 17, "Rule of Dumb,"

1309
01:02:45,240 --> 01:02:47,760
Patrick lucks his way into becoming king of Bikini Bottom,

1310
01:02:47,760 --> 01:02:49,040
and it's pretty much a nightmare.

1311
01:02:49,040 --> 01:02:49,540
[laughs]

1312
01:02:49,540 --> 01:02:50,040
Yeah.

1313
01:02:50,040 --> 01:02:51,800
Yeah, it's pretty much a hell world.

1314
01:02:51,800 --> 01:02:55,840
SpongeBob becomes his servant and gets treated more like a doormat than any kind of friend.

1315
01:02:55,840 --> 01:02:59,120
In fact, the Mad King torments all of Bikini Bottom,

1316
01:02:59,120 --> 01:03:04,120
forcing them to give up worldly possessions and demanding free stuff for everyone, or from everyone.

1317
01:03:04,120 --> 01:03:08,120
It's kind of an animal farm type allegory.

1318
01:03:08,120 --> 01:03:13,120
When Squidward refuses to play along, Patrick compels SpongeBob to make the squid yield.

1319
01:03:13,120 --> 01:03:17,120
SpongeBob genuinely fears his BFF. Some creatures go mad with power.

1320
01:03:17,120 --> 01:03:20,120
Some creatures go mad with power. That's a fact.

1321
01:03:20,120 --> 01:03:21,120
Stars go mad with power.

1322
01:03:21,120 --> 01:03:23,120
Patrick is straight up a creature.

1323
01:03:23,120 --> 01:03:28,120
Yeah. Oh, Patrick is an allegory for the stars of the world, the Hollywood elite.

1324
01:03:28,120 --> 01:03:32,040
gain power and then are mean to their sponge friends.

1325
01:03:32,040 --> 01:03:40,400
yeah yeah he lives underneath a rock much like oh my god much like Jeffrey

1326
01:03:40,400 --> 01:03:47,320
Epstein did on his island and Spongebob lives in a fruit oh my god Squidward

1327
01:03:47,320 --> 01:03:53,200
lives in his head. So Squidward is a representative of a guy who's he's of a

1328
01:03:53,200 --> 01:03:58,480
kind of a tortured millennial man who's mean because of his social anxiety, i.e.

1329
01:03:58,480 --> 01:04:00,320
he lives in his head.

1330
01:04:00,320 --> 01:04:00,920
Mm-hmm.

1331
01:04:00,920 --> 01:04:01,420
Whoa!

1332
01:04:01,420 --> 01:04:01,920
Do you get it?

1333
01:04:01,920 --> 01:04:09,480
Yeah, and SpongeBob is kind of an allegory for being a gay guy because he lives in a fruit.

1334
01:04:09,480 --> 01:04:09,980
And he's gay.

1335
01:04:09,980 --> 01:04:15,640
Which is kind of a, yeah, which is kind of a school school yard insult for a gay person.

1336
01:04:15,640 --> 01:04:16,140
Yeah.

1337
01:04:16,140 --> 01:04:21,160
And then Patrick rocks at being a star.

1338
01:04:21,160 --> 01:04:21,660
He's a rock star.

1339
01:04:21,660 --> 01:04:27,140
star he's a rock star sort of a Kevin Rudolph type and so when Patrick comes

1340
01:04:27,140 --> 01:04:33,940
alive he brings his fire and this next picture he's using a flamethrower uh-huh

1341
01:04:33,940 --> 01:04:42,580
because he brings the fire and then yes snail word is a is a Gary due to his due

1342
01:04:42,580 --> 01:04:47,700
to his because he's afraid of coming out of his shell yeah and then

1343
01:04:47,700 --> 01:04:55,620
Krusty Krab is red and he's actually he he represents a spicy pepper

1344
01:04:55,620 --> 01:05:01,140
which would be red and mean to you and then Sandy is actually women are the

1345
01:05:01,140 --> 01:05:05,780
squirrel of the world is basically what the show is trying to communicate yeah

1346
01:05:05,780 --> 01:05:13,700
and they belong and and and women belong in a dome are we starting to kind of see

1347
01:05:13,700 --> 01:05:17,760
I think I'm starting to understand. Women belong in a dome and they fear the bull

1348
01:05:17,760 --> 01:05:24,300
worm. Yes. That's true. You know? Women fear a bull worm. Women fear a bull worm. And then the whale,

1349
01:05:24,300 --> 01:05:32,420
the whale, the pearl is actually, pearl rhymes with girl and then most girls are

1350
01:05:32,420 --> 01:05:37,620
actually whales to me. Yeah. You know because it's something. Absolutely. Yeah.

1351
01:05:37,620 --> 01:05:43,540
Because they have. You messed up for that one. Larry, Larry the lobster. You messed up for that one.

1352
01:05:43,540 --> 01:05:47,860
a lobster because he actually and he actually represents my uncle Michael

1353
01:05:47,860 --> 01:05:55,540
very red skin cancer yeah all kind of what I'm basically saying and what most

1354
01:05:55,540 --> 01:06:01,260
people who do media criticism are saying is that TV is about my life uh-huh you

1355
01:06:01,260 --> 01:06:06,500
know lost is about the time I got lost Brooklyn nine nine is about the time I

1356
01:06:06,500 --> 01:06:13,340

1385
01:07:43,140 --> 01:07:45,780
Not even that hard I

1386
01:07:45,780 --> 01:07:47,780
Could just do this

1387
01:07:47,780 --> 01:07:51,820
Plankton basically represents the children of the world

1388
01:07:51,820 --> 01:07:52,180
Yeah

1389
01:07:52,180 --> 01:07:57,920
angry at the parents exactly allowing them to cook and you know what they say and that it in the in the land of the

1390
01:07:57,920 --> 01:08:00,780
Blind a one-eyed man is king. Okay, and

1391
01:08:01,340 --> 01:08:07,020
And that refers to how plankton kind of pulls the strings on all of Bikini Bottom.

1392
01:08:07,020 --> 01:08:09,980
It's true. Like people don't talk about that enough.

1393
01:08:09,980 --> 01:08:15,660
Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy represent the onset of grooming in today's society.

1394
01:08:15,660 --> 01:08:18,540
That's true because there's an old guy and a guy who's a little bit younger.

1395
01:08:18,540 --> 01:08:21,820
Exactly. And they're into barnacles and mermaids. And you know what that means.

1396
01:08:21,820 --> 01:08:23,340
Yeah, which is a big part of grooming.

1397
01:08:23,340 --> 01:08:23,580
Yeah.

1398
01:08:23,580 --> 01:08:28,940
Yeah. You're putting each other's barnacles on your friend until they become a mermaid.

1399
01:08:30,380 --> 01:08:33,580
Yeah, I put my barnacle on your mermaid because I'm grooning you.

1400
01:08:33,580 --> 01:08:39,980
Whatever, back in my day grooming is what we called when you got married to your beautiful husband.

1401
01:08:39,980 --> 01:08:42,800
All right.

1402
01:08:42,800 --> 01:08:46,320
