00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:55,800
But now it just sounds like we're making like real Carol basket jokes. Yeah

137
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:59,880
No, it's funny to start doing this like four months after that documentary

Yeah, we're saying a caboo like nobody's talking about it anymore and we're like, I know yeah more like care boo-bobby boo

00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:19,720
Let's go to a Wah Wah in Kawa.

142
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:21,720
Yeah, more like that.

143
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:25,720
We should just start our own tiger murder farm or whatever.

144
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:26,720
Yeah, let's do it.

145
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:28,720
We should start our own Wah Wah.

00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:29,720
Oh my god.

147
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:32,720
We get all the hoagies we want, all the free mountain dew.

148
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:36,720
Unlimited sandwiches, unlimited mountain dew, and ours would actually have Baja Blast.

149
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:41,720
And it would have another flavor called California Crush.

150
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:42,560
Crush.

151
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:47,560
We'd get our own Wawa exclusive Mountain Dew flavor

152
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:48,760
that they have.

153
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:49,600
Wawa Blast.

154
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:50,420
Wawa Blast.

155
00:07:50,420 --> 00:07:51,420
Yeah, okay.

156
00:07:51,420 --> 00:07:54,700
And it tastes like a New Jersey steel mill.

157
00:07:54,700 --> 00:07:56,580
It tastes like a used plastic glove

158
00:07:56,580 --> 00:07:57,420
that those people wear.

159
00:07:57,420 --> 00:07:58,260
(laughing)

160
00:07:58,260 --> 00:07:59,100
And they give you free refills.

161
00:07:59,100 --> 00:08:01,220
It tastes like linking to order screen.

162
00:08:01,220 --> 00:08:05,740
They give you free refills in your wallet, of your wallet.

163
00:08:05,740 --> 00:08:07,420
They refill your wallet with money.

164
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:09,380
Free refills of, and gas.

165
00:08:09,380 --> 00:08:10,700
Free refills on gas.

166
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:11,540
Oh shit.

167
00:08:11,540 --> 00:08:16,580
get free gas too if we owned a wall. Oh my god! Free gas! We could run our generator.

168
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:21,500
Uh-huh. The one that we all... In our bunker. Yeah, that we plugged up to our big computer.

169
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:26,060
That tells us what to say. We could finally start our lifelong dream of making a pool

170
00:08:26,060 --> 00:08:34,060
of... with gas... made of filled with gasoline. We could finally have a pool of gas. Yeah, finally. We've been saving up... that's the entire budget of

171
00:08:34,060 --> 00:08:39,140
Jackass 4. It's just gallons of gas to fill up a pool for Stevo to jump in. Yeah.

172
00:08:39,140 --> 00:08:41,460
That's what we're putting the Patreon money toward.

173
00:08:41,460 --> 00:08:42,900
We're starting a Wawa.

174
00:08:42,900 --> 00:08:45,100
We're starting our own Stevo style pool.

175
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:45,940
Yeah, there's a pool out back.

176
00:08:45,940 --> 00:08:46,780
We're starting our own Stevo.

177
00:08:46,780 --> 00:08:48,340
It's filled with gasoline.

178
00:08:48,340 --> 00:08:49,180
It's Stevo style.

179
00:08:49,180 --> 00:08:50,460
We're gonna make our own Stevo.

180
00:08:50,460 --> 00:08:53,100
We're gonna make our own Stevo out of like kids next,

181
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:55,820
code name Kid Next Door 2x4 technology.

182
00:08:55,820 --> 00:08:58,700
Just like wood and rubber bands until we have a Stevo.

183
00:08:58,700 --> 00:09:00,980
They're making a Stevo Bionicle

184
00:09:00,980 --> 00:09:02,980
and we're bringing it to life.

185
00:09:02,980 --> 00:09:04,020
They are, yeah.

186
00:09:04,020 --> 00:09:05,860
They're making a Stevo Lego.

187
00:09:05,860 --> 00:09:06,780
What's up dude?

188
00:09:06,780 --> 00:09:08,840
I got the mask of light.

189
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:14,480
We're gonna take this mask of light and I'm gonna put it up my ass.

190
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:15,480
Yeah man!

191
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:17,440
I wasn't allowed to play with Bionicle growing up.

192
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:23,280
I think my parents thought it was too Asian.

193
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:26,880
They thought it was too close to anime, which I was also not allowed to watch.

194
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:36,000
I hope Bionicle, if somebody tries to cancel Bionicle for culturally appropriating tiki's

195
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,400
and Hawaiian culture.

196
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:40,760
Oh yeah, that's kind of the whole thing isn't it?

197
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:42,800
I'm just waiting for that to happen.

198
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:46,520
Canceling Crash Bandicoot for Aku Aku.

199
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:47,920
I think that happened.

200
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:48,920
It did?

201
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:49,920
I think so.

202
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:51,640
That's so funny.

203
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:54,680
Did Tak and the Power of Juju get clipped too?

204
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:58,680
I don't think enough people remember Tak and the Power of Juju.

205
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:03,200
Not enough people remember that, but if you do, it had a show.

206
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:08,200
Juju is actually an extremely sacred power, okay, in Ohio.

207
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:14,200
Yeah, Tack and the Power of Juju had a Nickelodeon show.

208
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:19,200
As a Juju myself, I find the idea

209
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:23,360
that Tack could control me absolutely reprehensible.

210
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:29,260
Yeah.

211
00:10:29,260 --> 00:10:31,460
Yeah, but what have you guys been up to?

212
00:10:31,460 --> 00:10:32,300
Nothing really.

213
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:37,980
Sapporo last night. Oh nice. Did you get one of those big cans? No, I got a 12er of it.

214
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:47,360
A 12er? 12er. Hmm. A 12er of the tiny ones? Yeah, like 12 ounce cans. Oh, now I'm

215
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:52,880
understanding. Mm-hmm. Gotcha. I got this, I got this big hat. Oh yeah, you got the big

216
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:58,600
hat. Yeah, I got a big hat for my big head. You got the fat hat. Nice. This has definitely

217
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:04,040
been the most eventful week for me during quarantine. Just like, I know, just

218
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:08,920
somebody I know went to the hospital because he was allergic to sunscreen and

219
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:15,000
that was just like, that's yeah, this kid I know, he went on a boy's trip and

220
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:20,600
they invited one of the, one of the boy's fiancés, which is just so fucked up. I

221
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:25,920
would never let a girl to the boys trip beach house. Yeah. And so God punished him

222
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:29,880
accordingly. And first of all, that girl ended up having COVID.

223
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:33,560
So everybody in the house was exposed to it.

224
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:38,640
And then he also like on the last day put on sunscreen

225
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:41,080
for the, I guess the first time. And then immediately,

226
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:45,760
just like his entire body puffed up in like, like Majin Buu.

227
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:50,920
And he went to the ER. Yeah. It's funnier if you know this kid.

228
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:54,520
It's way funnier if you know who he is. He's like, um,

229
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:56,560
He's allergic to everything.

230
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:57,400
Damn.

231
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:59,220
Yeah, but that's--

232
00:11:59,220 --> 00:12:01,960
Yeah, it's actually, Patrick, are you allergic to grass?

233
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:02,800
Yeah.

234
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:04,360
I might be.

235
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:05,200
That would make sense, right?

236
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:06,840
Patrick, I think she's allergic.

237
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:08,400
I get hives if I sit in it.

238
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:10,800
I get hives.

239
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:11,840
I get hives.

240
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:12,840
Yeah.

241
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:17,440
Fucking, oh yeah, my dad's COVID free.

242
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:18,280
Nice.

243
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:19,400
Yeah. Congrats.

244
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:21,840
He got a certificate, they hung it up on the fridge.

245
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:24,080
(laughing)

246
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:25,840
(laughing)

247
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:27,560
But if you get it, I mean--

248
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:30,000
- Not for COVID, he did the presidential fitness test

249
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:30,840
while he was at the hospital.

250
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:32,160
- While he had COVID.

251
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:34,080
- Yeah, and they were like, "Well, he can't have it

252
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:36,480
"if he can do that many pull-ups."

253
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:39,200
- Yeah, he did the fitness Graham Pacer test,

254
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:41,420
and they were like, "How is he doing this?

255
00:12:41,420 --> 00:12:43,240
"He's got strong-ass lungs."

256
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:44,080
- Yeah.

257
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:45,720
- But yeah, he's COVID-free. - Well, congrats for it.

258
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:47,080
Does your mom have it now?

259
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:48,120
- I don't know.

260
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:48,960
She's still there. - Are they fuckin'--

261
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:50,920
- They're on like-- - Playing hockey

262
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:52,760
with that shit back and forth?

263
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:58,840
maybe they probably got to do like another um test because he's like quarantined for two weeks too

264
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:06,440

- You know what, I'm gonna spend time with both of them.

272
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:32,320
I think they're probably getting bored and lonely.

273
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:34,320
They need to do some physical activity.

274
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:36,080
It's good for COVID.

275
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:37,920

00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:40,200
- You're not gonna do that.

00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:41,580
- I am, I'm gonna wear a mask

279
00:13:41,580 --> 00:13:43,240

281
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:46,880
So I can use my nose.

00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:49,880
Yeah, so I can fuck your dad with my nose.

283

You're not gonna fuck my dad.

284
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:57,880
I'm gonna create, I'm gonna use various rubber bands to make a little butthole with your dad's ball skin and then fuck it with my nose.

285
00:13:57,880 --> 00:14:00,880
I'm serious.

286
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:11,880
I'm gonna tighten it up so hard and then create a canal with rubber bands that I'm wrapping around themselves over and over again until they're maybe six inches long.

287
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:16,840
I'm gonna use my and I'm gonna tell 10 lies in a row and then fuck your dad with my big nose.

I'm normal, it's not possible.

326
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:22,040
It's not normal.

My angle, I'm kind of fat.

You're not normal.

00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:38,300
We have something we can do, but we can't figure it out.

338
00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:39,140
Yeah.

339
00:17:39,140 --> 00:17:42,520
You, I think maybe there's too many things.

340
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:43,440
No.

341
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:44,280
Yeah.

342
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:45,100
No, there's not a single thing.

343
00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:46,220
There's too many things.

344
00:17:46,220 --> 00:17:49,500
There's too many things, both mental, physical, and spiritual.

345
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:52,100
All right, will you stay away from my spirituality?

346
00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:52,940
That is awful.

347
00:17:52,940 --> 00:17:53,780
(laughing)

348
00:17:53,780 --> 00:17:55,540
Stay away from my spirit.

349
00:17:55,540 --> 00:17:56,380
Cameron is funny because of his spirit.

350
00:17:56,380 --> 00:17:58,580
Whatever you do, you do not make fun of my soul.

351
00:17:58,580 --> 00:18:01,620
Yeah, Cameron is too spiritual.

352
00:18:01,620 --> 00:18:04,500
Carole Baskin, that reminds me of Cameron's wretched soul.

353
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:06,740
(laughing)

354
00:18:06,740 --> 00:18:08,460
Yeah.

355
00:18:08,460 --> 00:18:11,280
Yeah, no, but seriously, don't talk about my soul.

356
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:12,120
I'm going to.

357
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:14,420
That will make me so mad.

358
00:18:14,420 --> 00:18:15,660
You are so dumb.

359
00:18:15,660 --> 00:18:16,940
Your soul is oblong.

360
00:18:16,940 --> 00:18:19,860
- That is the one thing you shouldn't do around us,

361
00:18:19,860 --> 00:18:22,020
is tell us not to do something.

362
00:18:22,020 --> 00:18:23,340
- Yeah, that's right.

363
00:18:23,340 --> 00:18:24,940
- You know me and Patrick. - Tell us not to make fun

364
00:18:24,940 --> 00:18:26,900

365
00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:31,180
Kind of a Phineas and Ferb style troublemaking duo.

366
00:18:31,180 --> 00:18:35,420
- Yeah, we kinda do summer vacation pranks.

367

00:18:39,220 --> 00:18:40,060
- Nah, I don't think so. - Yeah.

370
00:18:40,060 --> 00:18:41,340
- I don't think so. - That's what it is.

371
00:18:41,340 --> 00:18:42,620
- You're always tattling on us,

372
00:18:42,620 --> 00:18:45,580

413
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:24,080
tree tracksuit and he's standing outside of a teen girl's window with binoculars

414

killers

415
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:32,080
israeli

416
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:36,040
if you google kaleb pitts that is there's a guy named kaleb pitts who killed

417
00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:39,720
himself because he was caught uh... looking into a teen girls window as he

418
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:43,040
was changing dressed in a camera arrested and i think the entire

419
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:46,840
serbs are keeping time and then he killed himself right after

420
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:52,080
yes i think i would be if you look at the if you look at the look at greg

421
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:57,760
peppers though there is a mugshot of a man who look your Carol Baskin name is

422
00:21:57,760 --> 00:22:09,200
Greg Peppers post your Carol Baskin's name below. That's right. You know if you search Greg Peppers I think the first thing that comes up is an

423
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:15,200
ebombs world article about it. Yeah now it is but it used to be it used to be a

424
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:21,040
mugshot of a guy that looks like Caleb. No but every mugshot of a guy looks like

425
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:29,480
me dude. That's true. You're like a, if this person does not exist, was trained on every

426
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:36,840
Aryan Brotherhood member. You keep refreshing it over and over and every time it's your

427
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:42,440
face it never changes. That's the only thing it can generate. My lips are too big to be

428
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:48,960
Aryan Brotherhood man. They wouldn't let me in. I'm too pretty. No. They could tell I'm

429
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:53,960
from the from the the the sea no they'd let you be first lady to the president

430
00:22:53,960 --> 00:23:01,560
no no yeah no they wouldn't no they would no they wouldn't they would they hate me

431
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:11,800
so much that they would make me they would put me in jail inside yeah yeah

432
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:15,480
they have another jail inside they'd put you in timeout in the bed you have to

433
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:18,920
sit on the bed the worst thing the worst thing that can happen to you in jail is

434
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:26,500
is probably time out. Yeah, probably. Yeah, I would say that's a huge problem right now

435
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:32,560
is people going to time out in jail. Yeah. Because it's basically a double sentence,

436
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:37,980
you know, time out for life, no chance of parole. And then you get into double time

437
00:23:37,980 --> 00:23:44,680
out? Yeah. Oh my God. And then you get, no, actually one of the biggest problems is double

438
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:46,280
dog daring in jail.

439
00:23:46,280 --> 00:23:47,280
Yeah.

440
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:53,720
So you'll double dog dare somebody to use a shiv on another guy and they're like, "Fuck,

441
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:55,400
if I don't do this, I'm a wimp."

442
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:56,400
Yeah.

443
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:57,400
Yeah.

444
00:23:57,400 --> 00:23:58,880
And you know what happens to wimps in jail?

445
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:00,440
They get raped.

446
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:01,440
It's true.

447
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:03,480
They end up-- That's what happens to wimps.

448
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:05,200
--gotta put on the wimp cap.

449
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:08,360

00:27:28,900 --> 00:27:31,140
(laughing)

503
00:27:31,140 --> 00:27:35,160
All right, so number one, when the teacher presents you

504
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:37,860
a question on the whiteboard with an X on it,

505
00:27:37,860 --> 00:27:40,280
throw a sharp pen or pencil at the X

506
00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:42,160
and hope it spears in the middle.

507
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:45,160
If it does, say X marks the spot.

508
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:47,400
- Now that's not funny, that's just bad ass.

509
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:50,300
- Yeah, that's just like a Robin Hood

510
00:27:50,300 --> 00:27:53,000
like split an arrow with another arrow kind of thing.

511
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:54,480
That's so impressive.

512
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:58,720
That should get you like a golden ticket

513
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:00,480
to skip like a day of school.

514
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:01,880
- That's no, that skips you a grade.

515
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:02,720
That's how you skip a grade.

516
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:04,680
- Yeah, that's how you skip a grade.

517
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:07,340
if you can throw a pencil so well that it hits an X.

518
00:28:07,340 --> 00:28:08,680
But then it's also like Uno,

519
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:10,920
where if you don't say X marks the spot,

520
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:13,060
it's gonna be not. - Yeah, you go back.

521
00:28:13,060 --> 00:28:13,900
Yeah, you go back. - You go back

522
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:16,060
all the way to preschool, no matter what.

523
00:28:16,060 --> 00:28:22,280
Yeah, not funny, just cool.

524
00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:24,220
- Yeah. - Yeah, just a very cool skill

525
00:28:24,220 --> 00:28:25,460
to have.

526
00:28:25,460 --> 00:28:30,460
More classes in school should be archery-based.

527
00:28:30,460 --> 00:28:33,560
- Did you guys have to do archery in middle school?

528
00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:35,560
What kind of fucking school did you go to, dude?

529
00:28:35,560 --> 00:28:37,560
What are you even talking about right now?

530
00:28:37,560 --> 00:28:39,560
Yeah, I did archery.

531
00:28:39,560 --> 00:28:41,560
You go to school in like New Zealand?

532
00:28:41,560 --> 00:28:43,560
No, I went to school in New Hampshire.

533
00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:45,560
He had an archery unit.

534
00:28:45,560 --> 00:28:47,560
He went to school in Blackthorn Keep.

535
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:49,560
Yeah.

536
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:51,560
He was taught by a wizard, dude.

537
00:28:51,560 --> 00:28:53,560
He was being actually taught to chant arrows.

538
00:28:53,560 --> 00:28:55,560
Merlin taught him to chant.

539
00:28:55,560 --> 00:28:57,560
He went to the school at the beginning of the first Fable game.

540
00:28:57,560 --> 00:28:59,560
Yeah.

541
00:28:59,560 --> 00:29:01,560
Yeah, that's where he went.

542
00:29:01,560 --> 00:29:04,280
His only classes were archery and fighting a knight.

543
00:29:04,280 --> 00:29:07,240
Yeah, dude, and instead of lunch, they had banquet.

544
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:09,000
And that's why Pat looks like he does.

545
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:12,200
You had to talk to a tree that looked like an old man, and that was the principle.

546
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:16,760
They had a joust in the middle of our lunch room.

547
00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:17,000
Yeah.

548
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,480
And it was the janitors with jousting tools.

549
00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:20,680
With brooms.

550
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:21,640
With brooms, yeah.

551
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:23,560
Yeah, but they would really die.

552
00:29:23,560 --> 00:29:25,080
You guys didn't have an archery unit?

553
00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:25,720
No.

554
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:26,280
A unit?

555
00:29:26,280 --> 00:29:27,000
Of course not.

556
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,440
Did they defend the school?

557
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:30,120
We had a whole--

558
00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:33,960
Wait, you guys didn't have a moat around your school filled with crocodiles?

559
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:35,440
What in the world?

560
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:38,800
Wait, did your guys' school have an ancient curse on it or was that just me?

561
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:45,120
After the Adam Lanza stuff, they put a moat around my school.

562
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:47,200
Filled with crocodiles.

563
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:55,560
You guys seriously didn't have like a bloodletting at the nurse's office or anything like that?

564
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:58,440
You guys didn't have an evil teacher?

565
00:29:58,440 --> 00:30:01,040
An evil teacher that you had to defeat every single year.

566
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:03,800
And who came back to life at the end of every day.

567
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:07,540
So you guys didn't, you're telling me you didn't have a giant three-headed dog that protected

568
00:30:07,540 --> 00:30:08,540
the homework.

569
00:30:08,540 --> 00:30:14,640
I, I don't understand why you guys didn't do like necromancy in your science class.

570
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:19,440
I mean I had, I had a little bit of uh, neck romancing, if you know what I'm saying.

571
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:20,440
Oh yeah.

572
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:22,440
Yeah, cause you, cause you fucked a dead body.

573
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:25,440
No, neck, no I romanced, I romanced, no.

574
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:27,560
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

575
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:32,160
You did necromancing with, and mancing means fucking.

576
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:33,800
That would be necroromancing.

577
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:35,400
I did necromancing with a woman's neck.

578
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:36,400
You did necroromancing.

579
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:41,280
And I left it, I left it, darted up with tons of little tiny things.

580
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:44,080
What are those called?

581
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:45,080
Stickies.

582
00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:48,880
I had little stickies all on a bitch.

583
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:49,880
Mm-hmm.

584
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:54,320
So you really had, you had archery.

585
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:55,320
Yeah, we had archery.

586
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:56,800
I had an archery unit in the eighth grade.

587
00:30:56,800 --> 00:31:00,160
- Yeah man, how many of your friends were goblins in school?

588
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:01,640
(laughing)

589
00:31:01,640 --> 00:31:02,480
- Most of them.

590
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:03,860
- Yeah, it was so clicky at my school.

591
00:31:03,860 --> 00:31:05,440
It was like the goblins and the orcs

592
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:06,880
all sat with each other over here.

593
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:09,120
- Yeah, the goblins and the orcs, the bosmers.

594
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:12,220
- The humans and the halflings had to sit together.

595
00:31:12,220 --> 00:31:16,040
- The bosmers had like their own table out in the woods.

596
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:20,640
Bosmers ate lunch in the woods.

597
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:21,480
- Yeah.

598
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:22,300
- Yeah man.

599
00:31:22,300 --> 00:31:23,140
- And it was hard 'cause all the bosmers

600
00:31:23,140 --> 00:31:25,620
were trying to eat the halflings and the humans.

601
00:31:25,620 --> 00:31:32,620
Yeah, one time I pranked my teacher by putting a caltrop on his throne and I had to go to the dungeon after class.

602
00:31:32,620 --> 00:31:36,620
[Laughter]

603
00:31:36,620 --> 00:31:37,620
Yeah.

604
00:31:37,620 --> 00:31:39,620
You seriously, you did archery in school?

605
00:31:39,620 --> 00:31:44,620
Our senior prank was it, for our senior prank we did a siege on the 8th grade.

606
00:31:44,620 --> 00:31:46,620
[Laughter]

607
00:31:46,620 --> 00:31:50,620
Yeah, we killed the principal with a battering ram.

608
00:31:50,620 --> 00:31:52,620
We killed the king of the middle school.

609
00:31:52,620 --> 00:31:59,380
Yeah, we did a Trojan horse. We did a Trojan horse thing to the high school. That's how

610
00:31:59,380 --> 00:32:03,660
we got to freshman year. High school was normal though. I didn't have a...

611
00:32:03,660 --> 00:32:06,900
Yeah, high school was just a normal human high school.

612
00:32:06,900 --> 00:32:11,620
Yeah, but RuneScape middle school, very different.

613
00:32:11,620 --> 00:32:18,740
Yeah. I remember graduating and getting full Dvorak armor when I left middle school. It

614
00:32:18,740 --> 00:32:20,500
was so awesome, dude.

615
00:32:20,500 --> 00:32:26,540
sucked because our principal was a daedra yeah the assistant principal was the

616
00:32:26,540 --> 00:32:32,300
cow fight Queen yeah and we had to defeat him I remember one time the the police

617
00:32:32,300 --> 00:32:36,780
came to the school and had their curse sniffing dogs and confiscated a cursed

618
00:32:36,780 --> 00:32:45,220
ring from someone's locker yeah they found my enchanted blade yeah they got

619
00:32:45,220 --> 00:32:49,420
suspended and he got suspended from reality they had to go to a different

620
00:32:49,420 --> 00:33:06,460
realm she goes to a different realm yeah I guess I did go to a pretty weird like

621
00:33:06,460 --> 00:33:10,900
middle school die - I already talked about diversity day yeah you know we had

622
00:33:10,900 --> 00:33:19,600
No, no, no, no, Immigration Day. Yeah. Very different. Very different. That's when they

623
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:23,740
opened a portal and let the demons immigrate into your school. Yeah, they let the demons

624
00:33:23,740 --> 00:33:28,360
immigrate into your school. No, but imagine like doing like Immigration Day and then like

625
00:33:28,360 --> 00:33:34,700
while that's going on kids are outside shooting bow and arrows. Fuck, my middle school was

626
00:33:34,700 --> 00:33:39,740
so fucked. My whole school, my whole school district was fucked. Anyways. I feel like

627
00:33:39,740 --> 00:33:45,340
New Hampshire probably not, seemingly well funded enough to own archery equipment.

628
00:33:45,340 --> 00:33:48,940
But probably besides that I'm guessing the teachers don't pay too much.

629
00:33:48,940 --> 00:33:51,940
Yeah, no the archery equipment just belonged to one of the teachers.

630
00:33:51,940 --> 00:33:52,940
Yeah.

631
00:33:52,940 --> 00:33:55,980
He just had that and he was like, "Hey, why don't we add an archery unit?"

632
00:33:55,980 --> 00:33:57,340
This is what PE is.

633
00:33:57,340 --> 00:34:00,780
Yeah, I have about 50 bows and 10,000 arrows.

634
00:34:00,780 --> 00:34:02,940
Do you guys want to add an archery unit to gym class?

635
00:34:02,940 --> 00:34:05,540
Yeah, I just have these.

636
00:34:05,540 --> 00:34:08,580
Maybe they're just around.

637
00:34:08,580 --> 00:34:10,580
It's so weird, I found these.

638
00:34:10,580 --> 00:34:13,340
They're buried underneath the school.

639
00:34:13,340 --> 00:34:15,660
I think your mic just unplugged or something.

640
00:34:15,660 --> 00:34:16,660
Mine?

641
00:34:16,660 --> 00:34:17,660
Yeah.

642
00:34:17,660 --> 00:34:20,260
Is your audio just shared?

643
00:34:20,260 --> 00:34:21,260
I'm smart.

644
00:34:21,260 --> 00:34:24,140
Yeah, you're gonna have to restart that in Audacity.

645
00:34:24,140 --> 00:34:25,140
Yeah, alright.

646
00:34:25,140 --> 00:34:27,420
I'm going down the time stamp.

647
00:34:27,420 --> 00:34:29,260
You're so smart, dude.

648
00:34:29,260 --> 00:34:34,000
Number two, run over and scream at the teacher that she killed Larry and then get out a plush

649
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:39,980
toy out of your bag and pretend to grieve over it. Now that's funny. That's pretty good.

650
00:34:39,980 --> 00:34:45,600
That's some funny ass shit. Yeah, accuse your teacher of murder, one of the

651
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:51,240
Ten Commandments. You know? Yeah, teachers shall not murder. Teachers shall not

652
00:34:51,240 --> 00:34:56,080
murder Larry. Yeah. Oh and then somebody says no don't kill Larry he's the best

653
00:34:56,080 --> 00:35:02,100
cucumber. Originally there were a lot more

654
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:05,460
commandments because they just got stuck on listing every day they were like

655
00:35:05,460 --> 00:35:10,980
teachers shall not kill janitors shall not kill and just listed every type of

656
00:35:10,980 --> 00:35:15,100
person but then they had to cut it down Larry the cucumber was kind of the

657
00:35:15,100 --> 00:35:20,100
first pickle Rick that's true facts you know that's facts it's actually it's a

658
00:35:20,100 --> 00:35:27,580
man and who's a cucumber a ganker and he's but he was kind of the opposite

659
00:35:27,580 --> 00:35:34,500
because he was so stupid for believing in God yeah yeah that's the difference a

660
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:39,980
cucumber is pure and unpickled and because Larry believed in God and a

661
00:35:39,980 --> 00:35:45,820
pickle is sour. The sour pickle who's nihilistic and atheistic who has lost

662
00:35:45,820 --> 00:35:52,500
his faith becomes a genius yeah he was pickled in vinegar and a

663
00:35:52,500 --> 00:35:56,380
copy of... Yeah he was pickled in your ass dude when you stuck him up there. Yeah that's

664
00:35:56,380 --> 00:36:01,500
right yeah that's right and then but but Larry on the other hand was pickled in

665
00:36:01,500 --> 00:36:09,220
God's light and love yeah so he actually he's you know and he's looking for his

666
00:36:09,220 --> 00:36:14,020
hairbrush - yeah you'd have any fucking hair I think that's kind of the joke

667
00:36:14,020 --> 00:36:20,860
what yeah is that he we're joking he's look yeah yeah get this it's it the whole

668
00:36:20,860 --> 00:36:27,940
thing was an allegory for a joke. What the fuck? Yeah, it's true. Oh my god, they can't

669
00:36:27,940 --> 00:36:34,700
be doing that. I took it serious. Me too, man. I thought that plum bitch was hot. I

670
00:36:34,700 --> 00:36:39,180
thought he was in pain from not having his hair brushed. Probably all of them were in

671
00:36:39,180 --> 00:36:46,300
such horrible pain all the time because they're vegetables. They're slowly rotting away, decomposing

672
00:36:46,300 --> 00:36:49,740
at a very fast rate but they have sentience

673
00:36:49,740 --> 00:36:51,100
and so they're just

674
00:36:51,100 --> 00:36:55,860

You communicate it.

700
00:38:21,500 --> 00:38:22,500
Oh my.

701
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:23,500
You send it.

00:38:23,500 --> 00:38:24,500
Oh my god.

Alright, so it is google.com/search?q=veggietales+as+humans.

00:38:33,500 --> 00:38:35,060
I'm looking at it now.

706
00:38:35,060 --> 00:38:36,380
And sxsrf=alex.

707
00:38:36,380 --> 00:38:40,380
S-R-F equals A-L-E-K.

708
00:38:40,380 --> 00:38:42,220
- Dude, you wanna have S-E-X.

709
00:38:42,220 --> 00:38:45,420
You wanna have S-E-X with a V-E-G-E-T-E-E-B-E.

710
00:38:45,420 --> 00:38:50,420
- You wanna have S-E-X with a V-E-G-I-N-A-T-L-E-S.

711
00:38:50,420 --> 00:38:55,660
- No, no, a V-E-I-G-A.

712
00:38:55,660 --> 00:38:58,460
(laughing)

713
00:38:58,460 --> 00:39:03,020
Dude, I'm gonna have a little S-E-X with a V-I-G-A, dude.

714
00:39:03,020 --> 00:39:04,100
- Nah, I don't believe you.

715
00:39:04,100 --> 00:39:05,660
- Dude, from a G-U-R-L, dude.

716
00:39:05,660 --> 00:39:06,740
I don't believe you.

717
00:39:06,740 --> 00:39:08,100
I'm opening, oh yeah.

718
00:39:08,100 --> 00:39:11,420
Now, okay, so let's see here.

719
00:39:11,420 --> 00:39:13,780
I got this file you sent, Pat.

720
00:39:13,780 --> 00:39:15,620
Are these your friends that you sent?

721
00:39:15,620 --> 00:39:17,820
You accidentally sent a picture of your friends.

722
00:39:17,820 --> 00:39:19,180
This is your family?

723
00:39:19,180 --> 00:39:20,380
This is my family, yes.

724
00:39:20,380 --> 00:39:21,420
Okay, so let me get this straight.

725
00:39:21,420 --> 00:39:23,860
These are, this is your family.

726
00:39:23,860 --> 00:39:26,380
Yeah, they all kind of look like you.

727
00:39:26,380 --> 00:39:28,700
Who's the, which one is, what's the dog?

728
00:39:28,700 --> 00:39:32,580
I like the guy who's just like a Spanish piece of garlic.

729
00:39:32,580 --> 00:39:34,540
Oh yeah, he's cool as hell.

730
00:39:34,540 --> 00:39:37,700
He's one of the better characters.

731
00:39:37,700 --> 00:39:38,540
- And the onion?

732
00:39:38,540 --> 00:39:40,220
- The onion?

733
00:39:40,220 --> 00:39:41,060
Don't get me started on the onion, dude.

734
00:39:41,060 --> 00:39:41,880
- What's the dog?

735
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:43,980
Is the dog someone in the, what's the--

736
00:39:43,980 --> 00:39:45,380
- Yeah, the dog is you, bitch.

737
00:39:45,380 --> 00:39:46,420
- Is there a dog?

738
00:39:46,420 --> 00:39:47,260
- Yeah, there's a--

739
00:39:47,260 --> 00:39:48,540
- There was a dog in VeggieTales.

740
00:39:48,540 --> 00:39:49,380
- Who's the, no, there's--

741
00:39:49,380 --> 00:39:51,180
- It wasn't a dog, though.

742
00:39:51,180 --> 00:39:52,940
- A dog is not a vegetable, buddy.

743
00:39:52,940 --> 00:39:54,820
(laughing)

744
00:39:54,820 --> 00:39:57,180
- That is when I get done with it.

745
00:39:57,180 --> 00:39:58,540
- Yeah. - Whoa.

746
00:39:58,540 --> 00:40:00,580
- That's right, I beat dogs into a coma.

747
00:40:00,580 --> 00:40:02,820
(laughing)

748
00:40:02,820 --> 00:40:07,820
All right, I'm back on this list.

749
00:40:07,820 --> 00:40:08,820
What's up?

750
00:40:08,820 --> 00:40:09,820
Yeah, number three.

751
00:40:09,820 --> 00:40:12,140
Number three, flop around on the table acting drunk.

752
00:40:12,140 --> 00:40:17,020
Then when the teacher comes over, then when the teacher comes over, then insist you are

753
00:40:17,020 --> 00:40:18,020
low on battery.

754
00:40:18,020 --> 00:40:19,020
Okay, that's pretty funny.

755
00:40:19,020 --> 00:40:27,020
That's what I say when I can't get my penis hard and I'm about to have SEX with a VIDI.

756
00:40:27,020 --> 00:40:28,020
Oh babe, I'm so sorry.

757
00:40:28,020 --> 00:40:29,020
Baby, sorry, I'm low on battery.

758
00:40:29,020 --> 00:40:30,020
I have to recharge by playing video games.

759
00:40:30,020 --> 00:40:31,020
Sorry, I need to go get my...

760
00:40:31,020 --> 00:40:32,020
games.

761
00:40:32,020 --> 00:40:33,020
I need to recharge with my plug.

762
00:40:33,020 --> 00:40:34,020
Yeah.

763
00:40:34,020 --> 00:40:36,620
I'm thinking about what that might mean.

764
00:40:36,620 --> 00:40:37,620
You know what I'm saying?

765
00:40:37,620 --> 00:40:38,620
I gotta plug my house.

766
00:40:38,620 --> 00:40:41,500
I need to plug my thingy into the wall.

767
00:40:41,500 --> 00:40:44,780
And then there's just a hole in the wall not connected to an outlet.

768
00:40:44,780 --> 00:40:45,780
You'll put your balls in it.

769
00:40:45,780 --> 00:40:46,780
It's just a glory hole.

770
00:40:46,780 --> 00:40:47,780
In your neighbor.

771
00:40:47,780 --> 00:40:51,540
There's just a bunch of bugs on the other side.

772
00:40:51,540 --> 00:40:58,940
Your neighbor just left you.

773
00:40:58,940 --> 00:41:01,160
I don't think, I think if I had a glory hole

774
00:41:01,160 --> 00:41:04,580
between my apartment and the one next to mine,

775
00:41:04,580 --> 00:41:06,940
I don't think my penis would even fit through the,

776
00:41:06,940 --> 00:41:09,780
I don't think it would make it to the other end, you know?

777
00:41:09,780 --> 00:41:12,500
I don't, yeah, I don't think it's physically possible.

778
00:41:12,500 --> 00:41:13,540
Yeah, I think glory holes are fake.

779
00:41:13,540 --> 00:41:15,900
It's not physically possible to have a big penis.

780
00:41:15,900 --> 00:41:16,980
That's, yeah, that's all, yeah,

781
00:41:16,980 --> 00:41:19,900
the thing about a glory hole is it's not flattering.

782
00:41:19,900 --> 00:41:23,020
You're losing like an inch or an inch and a half almost.

783
00:41:23,020 --> 00:41:25,740
You're losing, yeah, you're losing like a good inch.

784
00:41:25,740 --> 00:41:27,940
Where's the glory in that, I ask you?

785
00:41:27,940 --> 00:41:28,780
Yeah.

786
00:41:28,780 --> 00:41:32,500
and that of putting out your little two and a half inch nub

787
00:41:32,500 --> 00:41:34,180
through the fucking hole.

788
00:41:34,180 --> 00:41:35,020
Yeah.

789
00:41:35,020 --> 00:41:36,900
And just begging some guy who looks exactly like you

790
00:41:36,900 --> 00:41:38,460
to do something with it.

791
00:41:38,460 --> 00:41:39,300
You know?

792
00:41:39,300 --> 00:41:41,820
Listen man, listen man, trucker to trucker,

793
00:41:41,820 --> 00:41:44,800
I promise, I promise it's longer than this normally.

794
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:47,940
The bathroom stall is cutting me off, dude.

795
00:41:47,940 --> 00:41:51,700
Look, they got some good like bulletproof wall here.

796
00:41:51,700 --> 00:41:54,700
Yeah, man, they got, man, this must be,

797
00:41:54,700 --> 00:41:58,460
he can clearly tell that it's like half an inch thick.

798
00:41:58,460 --> 00:42:02,020
Oh man, that's weird, man. This must be like a six inch...

799
00:42:02,020 --> 00:42:06,820
You know what, I bet it's thicker in the middle than it is on the end, so it may deceive you.

800
00:42:06,820 --> 00:42:09,220
- Oh, it's a beveled wall. - But it's actually super thick.

801
00:42:09,220 --> 00:42:12,300
- It's a beveled... - Yeah. I think it's beveled, maybe.

802
00:42:12,300 --> 00:42:17,300
They must have mudded over this part at some point, 'cause it's definitely thicker here.

803
00:42:17,300 --> 00:42:20,100
- (laughing) - Well, you know, I mean...

804
00:42:20,100 --> 00:42:23,380
You can just kinda play with it like the head's a big clit.

805
00:42:23,380 --> 00:42:26,260
(laughing)

806
00:42:26,260 --> 00:42:28,100
Just do that shit to it, man.

807
00:42:28,100 --> 00:42:29,780
- Yeah, just kinda flick it.

808
00:42:29,780 --> 00:42:31,220
- That's what I usually do.

809
00:42:31,220 --> 00:42:34,980
- All right, I'll see you at home.

810
00:42:34,980 --> 00:42:35,820
Bye, dad.

811
00:42:35,820 --> 00:42:38,220
(laughing)

812
00:42:38,220 --> 00:42:40,780
- Yeah, it says you have two bathrooms side by side

813
00:42:40,780 --> 00:42:42,820
in your house, in the upstairs.

814
00:42:42,820 --> 00:42:44,500
I'll see you downstairs, dad.

815
00:42:44,500 --> 00:42:46,860
- That's a way, hey baby,

816
00:42:46,860 --> 00:42:49,260
I know you just got back from work,

817
00:42:49,260 --> 00:42:50,200
but come to the bathroom.

818
00:42:50,200 --> 00:42:52,900
I did a little something I think will spice up your sex life.

819
00:42:52,900 --> 00:42:54,060
(laughing)

820
00:42:54,060 --> 00:42:56,740
I put a glory hole in the toilet.

821
00:42:56,740 --> 00:42:59,180
(laughing)

822
00:42:59,180 --> 00:43:00,740
- Put a, I put a hole in the toilet

823
00:43:00,740 --> 00:43:03,440
so I can stick my penis through and you can poop on it.

824
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:06,000
- Yeah. - Pretty awesome.

825
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,860
Number four, pretend to be a robot.

826
00:43:08,860 --> 00:43:10,320
That's kind of what the last one is.

827
00:43:10,320 --> 00:43:12,440
Pretend to be a robot as you silently watch the teacher

828
00:43:12,440 --> 00:43:14,860
answering in mechanical tones and terminology

829
00:43:14,860 --> 00:43:16,620
if the teacher picks you to answer.

830
00:43:16,620 --> 00:43:20,260
- Teach will get pissed, then again--

831
00:43:20,260 --> 00:43:21,300
- This is just like what the kid

832
00:43:21,300 --> 00:43:24,300
at Ashburgers in my class did.

833
00:43:24,300 --> 00:43:25,220
- Yeah.

834
00:43:25,220 --> 00:43:27,620
just pretend to be a robot like once every two weeks

835
00:43:27,620 --> 00:43:30,700
yeah i don't think you have to have a good i think that was the other side

836
00:43:30,700 --> 00:43:34,780
worth every two weeks a_t_t_ had a glitch for the real and here's a

837
00:43:34,780 --> 00:43:39,060
terminator and he was set back to kill me but he got distracted by t_v_ and

838
00:43:39,060 --> 00:43:39,940
she says

839
00:43:39,940 --> 00:43:44,400
and just a little bit back at the all artistic people a terminator secretly

840
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:47,180
that's true

That stuff looks good.

871
00:45:24,540 --> 00:45:26,540
The thing is, everything looks edible.

872
00:45:26,540 --> 00:45:28,540
It smells good too.

873
00:45:28,540 --> 00:45:30,540
Like, every... I mean, I wanted...

874
00:45:30,540 --> 00:45:32,540
When I was a kid, I wanted to eat...

875
00:45:32,540 --> 00:45:34,540
You remember the, like, Skechers or whatever that had

876
00:45:34,540 --> 00:45:36,540
the little gel, like,

877
00:45:36,540 --> 00:45:38,540
ball in it? I wanted to

878
00:45:38,540 --> 00:45:40,540
take that out with an ice cream scoop and eat it.

879
00:45:40,540 --> 00:45:41,500
Yeah.

880
00:45:41,500 --> 00:45:42,940
I was like, that probably had...

881
00:45:42,940 --> 00:45:44,460
They probably hid sugar in this.

882
00:45:44,460 --> 00:45:46,460
Yeah. I mean, the thing is, nowadays,

883
00:45:46,460 --> 00:45:48,460
they can make cakes that look like anything.

884
00:45:48,460 --> 00:45:50,460
So, if I'm walking down the street...

885
00:45:50,460 --> 00:45:56,060
If I'm walking down the street and I see a pile of dog dew, I mean, how do I know that

886
00:45:56,060 --> 00:46:00,180
Zumbo's Just Desserts didn't just come through and leave it on the side of the road?

887
00:46:00,180 --> 00:46:01,780
It could be a cake.

888
00:46:01,780 --> 00:46:02,780
It's the craziest thing.

889
00:46:02,780 --> 00:46:03,780
They make cakes look like anything.

890
00:46:03,780 --> 00:46:08,900
They even have cakes that look like a wedding cake, but there's two men at the top.

891
00:46:08,900 --> 00:46:09,900
Or two girls.

892
00:46:09,900 --> 00:46:12,120
It's crazy.

893
00:46:12,120 --> 00:46:13,860
It's called a mirrored cake.

894
00:46:13,860 --> 00:46:14,860
Yeah.

895
00:46:14,860 --> 00:46:15,860
No.

896
00:46:15,860 --> 00:46:16,860
Yeah, there's a glitch in the cake.

897
00:46:16,860 --> 00:46:18,780
Yeah, when you buy it.

898
00:46:18,780 --> 00:46:24,660
I'd like to, hey, I saw you ordered this wedding cake from us, but I just, there was a glitch

899
00:46:24,660 --> 00:46:29,340
in your order form where it said you wanted two girls on the top.

900
00:46:29,340 --> 00:46:31,300
No, two girls we can do.

901
00:46:31,300 --> 00:46:33,300
But two guys?

902
00:46:33,300 --> 00:46:34,300
Are you sure?

903
00:46:34,300 --> 00:46:37,260
Two girls I get it, because it's like kind of cool.

904
00:46:37,260 --> 00:46:38,260
It's funny.

905
00:46:38,260 --> 00:46:39,600
Yeah, it's funny.

906
00:46:39,600 --> 00:46:40,600
But come on.

907
00:46:40,600 --> 00:46:43,420
It's funny how that's basic, what was her name?

908
00:46:43,420 --> 00:46:44,420
Kim whatever.

909
00:46:44,420 --> 00:46:45,420
Kim Kardashian.

910
00:46:45,420 --> 00:46:47,500
That's like her entire court case.

911
00:46:47,500 --> 00:46:48,500
Yeah.

912
00:46:48,500 --> 00:46:54,060

925
00:48:05,540 --> 00:48:09,860
like twice this week and I've gone just completely insane both times yeah it's

926
00:48:09,860 --> 00:48:10,700
It's been pretty nice.

927
00:48:10,700 --> 00:48:11,540
It's been kind of refreshing.

928
00:48:11,540 --> 00:48:13,960
I used to go insane from weed and be bummed out about it.

929
00:48:13,960 --> 00:48:16,860
But now it's like, I mean, I'm not gonna like,

930
00:48:16,860 --> 00:48:18,940
it doesn't matter, I have nothing to do the next day.

931
00:48:18,940 --> 00:48:19,780
That's true.

932
00:48:19,780 --> 00:48:20,980
Except just throw all my clothes in my car.

933
00:48:20,980 --> 00:48:24,860
Man, I haven't smoked weed since before quarantine.

934
00:48:24,860 --> 00:48:26,700
I gotta go crazy.

935
00:48:26,700 --> 00:48:27,540
You gotta get on it, dude.

936
00:48:27,540 --> 00:48:28,500
Yeah, I gotta go mad.

937
00:48:28,500 --> 00:48:32,540
It's pretty fun to go crazy on weed every once in a while.

938
00:48:32,540 --> 00:48:34,540
It's not fun when it happens every time.

939
00:48:34,540 --> 00:48:35,580
When it happens every time?

940
00:48:35,580 --> 00:48:36,420
That's been months, though.

941
00:48:36,420 --> 00:48:37,620
That's pretty bad.

942
00:48:37,620 --> 00:48:39,380
Yeah, I thought that, the first time I thought it,

943
00:48:39,380 --> 00:48:40,700
I thought it was gonna be really bad,

944
00:48:40,700 --> 00:48:44,000
but I just went crazy in a way that I was just like,

945
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:48,060
like I just drank like four cups of water in a row.

946
00:48:48,060 --> 00:48:51,380
You know, like the lowest level of weed crazy.

947
00:48:51,380 --> 00:48:53,240
That's what I do every time.

948
00:48:53,240 --> 00:48:58,400
Man, there was like a good three month period

949
00:48:58,400 --> 00:49:00,340
where I was just smoking way too much weed.

950
00:49:00,340 --> 00:49:02,340
It's so funny that you became somebody

951
00:49:02,340 --> 00:49:03,500
who thought they were allergic to weed,

952
00:49:03,500 --> 00:49:05,540
to smoking weed all the time.

953
00:49:05,540 --> 00:49:09,080
And did you ever smoke weed and then record?

954
00:49:09,080 --> 00:49:13,420
Yeah, yeah several times and it ruined those are like our worst

955
00:49:13,420 --> 00:49:16,120
episodes, yeah

956
00:49:16,120 --> 00:49:21,580
Yeah, it was like a new level of Patrick. It was crazy. It was like it was like just like

957
00:49:21,580 --> 00:49:24,240
Like drunk Patrick, but in the daytime

958
00:49:24,240 --> 00:49:27,160
Yeah

00:49:27,160 --> 00:49:29,000
Doing now

960
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:31,000
Yeah, now it's it's

961
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:35,140
The day drinking is really I'm gonna have to just stop drinking for a month or so

962
00:49:35,140 --> 00:49:40,700
I gained like 8 pounds just because every night I drink a bottle and a half of wine.

963
00:49:40,700 --> 00:49:44,940
Damn, I've been drinking so much beer man.

964
00:49:44,940 --> 00:49:47,700
You've been drinking wine, you've been gaining weight in your tits dude.

965
00:49:47,700 --> 00:49:48,700
You're turning into a woman.

966
00:49:48,700 --> 00:49:49,700
Um, no.

967
00:49:49,700 --> 00:49:50,700
You just said yeah.

00:49:52,700 --> 00:49:53,700
Take it back!

971
00:49:53,700 --> 00:49:54,700
No.

972
00:49:54,700 --> 00:49:55,700
Take it back.

973
00:49:55,700 --> 00:49:56,700
No.

974
00:49:56,700 --> 00:49:57,700
How about now?

975
00:49:57,700 --> 00:49:58,700
Would you respect me if I had a big deep voice?

976
00:49:58,700 --> 00:49:59,700
Oh hey, kill me.

977
00:49:59,700 --> 00:50:00,700

Kill me.

982
00:50:04,700 --> 00:50:06,700
Caleb's dad just walked into the room.

983
00:50:06,700 --> 00:50:10,700
Hey son, hey son you need to take the trash out.

984
00:50:10,700 --> 00:50:13,700
Yeah, I'm referring to your mother.

985
00:50:13,700 --> 00:50:17,700
Hey dad, dad you and mom have been divorced for 15 years.

986
00:50:17,700 --> 00:50:19,700
Why are you in this house?

987
00:50:19,700 --> 00:50:22,700
Uh, I thought I smelled you.

988
00:50:22,700 --> 00:50:25,700
I left my keys here.

989
00:50:25,700 --> 00:50:30,700
Yeah, I left a little bit of cum in the toilet.

990
00:50:30,700 --> 00:50:32,700
I came to get it with a butterfly net.

991
00:50:32,700 --> 00:50:37,380
I have a pool filter cleaner thing.

992
00:50:37,380 --> 00:50:39,380
What's that thing called?

993
00:50:39,380 --> 00:50:40,380
Net.

994
00:50:40,380 --> 00:50:41,380
I have a net.

995
00:50:41,380 --> 00:50:44,260
Yeah, I got a net.

996
00:50:44,260 --> 00:50:47,820
Number six, whenever the teacher asks you to hand something out, drop it all over the

997
00:50:47,820 --> 00:50:51,740
floor and insist that you were checking to see if gravity still works.

998
00:50:51,740 --> 00:50:56,260
I did this and I got expelled.

999
00:50:56,260 --> 00:50:58,340
I did this and they shot me into space.

1000
00:50:58,340 --> 00:50:59,340
Yeah.

1001
00:50:59,340 --> 00:51:00,340
That was so bad.

1002
00:51:00,340 --> 00:51:06,880
I remember the biggest laugh I ever got in school was kind of a similar physical stunt

1003
00:51:06,880 --> 00:51:15,740
to this where I was turning in my test in fourth grade to the front of the classroom.

1004
00:51:15,740 --> 00:51:19,220
The teacher sets up her desk at the front so that people can come up and drop their

1005
00:51:19,220 --> 00:51:20,980
test off.

1006
00:51:20,980 --> 00:51:25,700
I walked up and right as I was walking up, a bunch of police cars with the sirens on

1007
00:51:25,700 --> 00:51:31,980
started like racing past the school and so I like I like threw everything off of

1008
00:51:31,980 --> 00:51:37,180
her desk all the papers and shit and jumped over it and I said oh shit it's

1009
00:51:37,180 --> 00:51:44,260
the fuzz and it just killed dude I mean it was I mean he crushed the teacher the

1010
00:51:44,260 --> 00:51:48,540
teacher could not stop laughing damn cuz that's the thing you can get away with

1011
00:51:48,540 --> 00:51:52,140
anything if you just make the teacher laugh that's true yeah I did uh there

1012
00:51:52,140 --> 00:51:54,180
We were watching a video in health class.

1013
00:51:54,180 --> 00:51:56,780
We watched a fucking Lifetime movie in my health class

1014
00:51:56,780 --> 00:51:57,980
in sophomore year.

1015
00:51:57,980 --> 00:51:58,820
- Nice.

1016
00:51:58,820 --> 00:52:01,420
- And, oh no, freshman year, and it was about syphilis.

1017
00:52:01,420 --> 00:52:04,140
It was about the dangers of transmitting syphilis.

1018
00:52:04,140 --> 00:52:04,960
- Yeah.

1019
00:52:04,960 --> 00:52:07,060
- And there was a scene where the boy goes,

1020
00:52:07,060 --> 00:52:08,700
"I got a gift for you."

1021
00:52:08,700 --> 00:52:10,100
And there was a pause.

1022
00:52:10,100 --> 00:52:13,020
There was a pause and I went, "Yeah, it's syphilis."

1023
00:52:13,020 --> 00:52:13,860
And--

1024
00:52:13,860 --> 00:52:14,940
- Oh my God, destroy it.

1025
00:52:14,940 --> 00:52:16,460
- Dude, I-- - Just absolute crush her, dude.

1026
00:52:16,460 --> 00:52:18,300
- I absolute fucking crushed it, man.

1027
00:52:18,300 --> 00:52:19,660
- Dude, and that's, dude,

1028
00:52:19,660 --> 00:52:21,460
that's when I knew I was gonna be a comedian, man.

1029
00:52:21,460 --> 00:52:25,700
That's when I knew I needed to go to an open mic in a basement.

1030
00:52:25,700 --> 00:52:26,700
Yeah, pretty much.

1031
00:52:26,700 --> 00:52:29,260
I mean, I used to get laughed all the time in school, man.

1032
00:52:29,260 --> 00:52:33,180
I used to go in the bathroom and show everybody my balls in a big circle and everybody would

1033
00:52:33,180 --> 00:52:34,260
point and laugh.

1034
00:52:34,260 --> 00:52:36,500
And that's when I knew I was meant for the stage.

1035
00:52:36,500 --> 00:52:37,500
That's true.

1036
00:52:37,500 --> 00:52:40,420
And now I'm in a local all-white production of Hamilton.

1037
00:52:40,420 --> 00:52:45,100
So it's pretty much worked out perfectly.

1038
00:52:45,100 --> 00:52:46,100
Yeah.

1039
00:52:46,100 --> 00:52:47,100
Yeah.

1040
00:52:47,100 --> 00:52:48,100
Do you think that exists?

1041
00:52:48,100 --> 00:52:49,100
Of course.

1042
00:52:49,100 --> 00:52:50,100
Absolutely.

1043
00:52:50,100 --> 00:52:51,580
- Do you think like some high school,

1044
00:52:51,580 --> 00:52:52,820
some well-meaning high school?

1045
00:52:52,820 --> 00:52:53,660
- Yeah, of course.

1046
00:52:53,660 --> 00:52:54,660
- In my theater class in college,

1047
00:52:54,660 --> 00:52:55,980
somebody from Connecticut talked about

1048
00:52:55,980 --> 00:52:58,420
how they did an all-white version of In the Heights.

1049
00:52:58,420 --> 00:53:00,660
(laughing)

1050
00:53:00,660 --> 00:53:04,260
Yeah, which is also like way more

1051
00:53:04,260 --> 00:53:05,700
like about being not white.

1052
00:53:05,700 --> 00:53:06,540
- Right, exactly.

1053
00:53:06,540 --> 00:53:07,860
- In Hamilton, Tennessee.

1054
00:53:07,860 --> 00:53:08,700
- Yeah.

1055
00:53:08,700 --> 00:53:09,540
- Holy shit.

1056
00:53:09,540 --> 00:53:10,360
- Yeah, and they were just like,

1057
00:53:10,360 --> 00:53:12,900
yeah, we didn't know any Dominican people.

1058
00:53:12,900 --> 00:53:13,940
(laughing)

1059
00:53:13,940 --> 00:53:16,700
So we just did an all-white version.

1060
00:53:16,700 --> 00:53:19,300
- The town next to me did all-white hairspray.

1061
00:53:19,300 --> 00:53:21,860
Damn. How do you do all white air spray?

1062
00:53:21,860 --> 00:53:22,860
I know, right?

1063
00:53:22,860 --> 00:53:27,740
Yeah, the people in my town actually did an all white version of Grease.

1064
00:53:27,740 --> 00:53:31,060
It's pretty fucked up, dude.

1065
00:53:31,060 --> 00:53:32,860
Yeah, none of them were Balkan.

1066
00:53:32,860 --> 00:53:33,860
None of them were Italian.

1067
00:53:33,860 --> 00:53:36,940
Yeah, none of them were from Greece at all.

1068
00:53:36,940 --> 00:53:38,940
Nah, it was fucked up, dude.

1069
00:53:38,940 --> 00:53:39,940
Yeah.

1070
00:53:39,940 --> 00:53:44,300
Number seven, when the teacher picks on you to answer a question, replace a completely

1071
00:53:44,300 --> 00:53:49,060
random word with something similar, completely different to it, and then scream, "Damn you

1072
00:53:49,060 --> 00:53:55,060
auto-correct while writhing in the ground in agony. The last part really adds another

1073
00:53:55,060 --> 00:53:59,140
layer to it. That'd be good with anything. Yeah I think that's just a separate thing.

1074
00:53:59,140 --> 00:54:05,420
Yeah finish eating your lunch and then writhe on the ground in agony. I think that

1075
00:54:05,420 --> 00:54:11,100
that is the completes any prank pretty well. Yeah that's I mean that's just it

1076
00:54:11,100 --> 00:54:15,500
doesn't matter what oh yeah the next one's good. Yeah in number eight in a

1077
00:54:15,500 --> 00:54:21,540
computer class, it is called different things around the world. Randomly walk over to other

1078
00:54:21,540 --> 00:54:27,120
students computers and rotate the screens with control R, alt, arrow key, if the teacher

1079
00:54:27,120 --> 00:54:32,680
complains turn off their computer using a shortcut. It's different things all around

1080
00:54:32,680 --> 00:54:37,680
the world. In caveman country it's called rock class.

1081
00:54:37,680 --> 00:54:38,680
Yeah. Yeah.

1082
00:54:38,680 --> 00:54:41,760
Yeah. In alien school it's just called class.

1083
00:54:41,760 --> 00:54:48,760
Yeah, in the Flintstones town it's called Birdglass, because you just type on a bird's feet.

1084
00:54:48,760 --> 00:54:49,760
Yeah.

1085
00:54:49,760 --> 00:54:50,760
Pretty awesome dude.

1086
00:54:50,760 --> 00:54:52,400
What if the Flintstones had a computer?

1087
00:54:52,400 --> 00:54:55,360
You gotta use a shortcut to turn off the teacher's computer.

1088
00:54:55,360 --> 00:54:56,360
Yeah.

1089
00:54:56,360 --> 00:54:57,360
I use a shortcut.

1090
00:54:57,360 --> 00:54:59,360
I go around the back of the teacher's desk.

1091
00:54:59,360 --> 00:55:00,360
That's a shortcut.

1092
00:55:00,360 --> 00:55:01,360
I get there faster.

1093
00:55:01,360 --> 00:55:02,360
I get there before the teacher.

1094
00:55:02,360 --> 00:55:05,160
Yeah, I pretty much teleport like in Jumper.

1095
00:55:05,160 --> 00:55:07,720
Yeah, there's a secret passage.

1096
00:55:07,720 --> 00:55:09,000
There's a secret passage.

1097
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:13,020
It's actually like Pac-Man where if I go out one door and then I come in the other side

1098
00:55:13,020 --> 00:55:14,020
of the classroom.

1099
00:55:14,020 --> 00:55:15,020
Yeah, exactly.

1100
00:55:15,020 --> 00:55:19,120
It's all just because it's computer's class.

1101
00:55:19,120 --> 00:55:21,520
Yeah, once you're in computer class, you're in the computer.

1102
00:55:21,520 --> 00:55:25,520
Yeah, once you're in computer class, things act a little differently in the classroom.

1103
00:55:25,520 --> 00:55:31,360
Do you guys remember hearing about sex ed and thinking that you would get to have sex?

1104
00:55:31,360 --> 00:55:32,360
No.

1105
00:55:32,360 --> 00:55:33,360
I remember having this fantasy.

1106
00:55:33,360 --> 00:55:35,240
I was very mature in sex ed.

1107
00:55:35,240 --> 00:55:38,280
I had this fantasy that when somebody told me like,

1108
00:55:38,280 --> 00:55:40,320
"Hey, you have to take sex ed next year,"

1109
00:55:40,320 --> 00:55:42,840
that I would show up and it would just be like a--

1110
00:55:42,840 --> 00:55:43,680
- You guys all have to watch.

1111
00:55:43,680 --> 00:55:44,880
- Like Lisa Ann is the teacher,

1112
00:55:44,880 --> 00:55:45,720
and they would just be like,

1113
00:55:45,720 --> 00:55:48,440
"Okay, pair up with somebody and have sex with them."

1114
00:55:48,440 --> 00:55:49,280
- Yeah.

1115
00:55:49,280 --> 00:55:53,160
- They had an anonymous question box,

1116
00:55:53,160 --> 00:55:56,800
and in my brother's year,

1117
00:55:56,800 --> 00:56:01,040
they had to get rid of the anonymous question box,

1118
00:56:01,040 --> 00:56:03,720
because all the kids were just writing

1119
00:56:03,720 --> 00:56:08,460
despicable things. Just despicable me quotes. Yeah they were just writing they

1120
00:56:08,460 --> 00:56:15,080
were writing "Oh Banana" "Oh Biddle Banana" "Ah Biddle" "Biddle Biddle Biddle"

1121
00:56:15,080 --> 00:56:25,040
We have to stop the anonymous box. They set up a team of minions to ask too many questions.

1122
00:56:25,040 --> 00:56:29,140
They're trying to steal the moon. Little did they know that would be similar to the

1123
00:56:29,140 --> 00:56:33,440
2016 election where a bunch of minions actually showed up to

1124
00:56:33,440 --> 00:56:38,760
vote instead of the instead of people with consciences. I just remember there

1125
00:56:38,760 --> 00:56:45,680
was a... Minions showed up for Trump but Bernie Bros didn't show up for Hillary so...

1126
00:56:45,680 --> 00:56:53,200
There was a guy at college at Emerson a guy came in to talk

1127
00:56:53,200 --> 00:56:58,760
about like the comedy industry and he was like okay like we're gonna like just

1128
00:56:58,760 --> 00:57:00,760
Like, right, if you have any questions, write them down and put them...

1129
00:57:00,760 --> 00:57:02,760
Okay, everyone partner up and have sex!

1130
00:57:02,760 --> 00:57:04,760
[Laughter]

1131
00:57:04,760 --> 00:57:06,760
Yeah.

1132
00:57:06,760 --> 00:57:08,760
And then just points to a kid and is like, "Oh, there's, uh,

1133
00:57:08,760 --> 00:57:10,760
definitely one extra, you're with me."

1134
00:57:10,760 --> 00:57:12,760
[Laughter]

1135
00:57:12,760 --> 00:57:14,760
And he's like, "Write down your questions and put them

1136
00:57:14,760 --> 00:57:16,760
in, like, this box and I'll answer them."

1137
00:57:16,760 --> 00:57:18,760
Like, I don't know why he did it and honestly it was really weird,

1138
00:57:18,760 --> 00:57:20,760
but then one of them got really mad

1139
00:57:20,760 --> 00:57:22,760
because one of the

1140
00:57:22,760 --> 00:57:24,760
questions was, "Is it normal to have hair

1141
00:57:24,760 --> 00:57:26,760
down there?"

1142
00:57:26,760 --> 00:57:28,760
*laughter*

1143
00:57:28,760 --> 00:57:30,760
*laughter*

1144
00:57:30,760 --> 00:57:32,760
He's like yelling at us.

1145
00:57:32,760 --> 00:57:34,760
*laughter*

1146
00:57:34,760 --> 00:57:36,760
Oh my god, that's good.

1147
00:57:36,760 --> 00:57:38,760
It's so incredible to do that in college.

1148
00:57:38,760 --> 00:57:40,760
Dude, imagine, imagine,

1149
00:57:40,760 --> 00:57:42,760
imagine being like a fucking comedy writer

1150
00:57:42,760 --> 00:57:44,760
and getting mad that somebody just

1151
00:57:44,760 --> 00:57:46,760
one-upped you. Yeah, someone's a genius.

1152
00:57:46,760 --> 00:57:48,760
Yeah, somebody's funny.

1153
00:57:48,760 --> 00:57:50,760
Yeah.

1154
00:57:50,760 --> 00:57:52,760
Is it normal to have hair down there?

1155
00:57:52,760 --> 00:57:54,760
*laughter*

1156
00:57:54,760 --> 00:57:55,760
That's good, dude.

1157
00:57:55,760 --> 00:57:56,760
So funny.

1158
00:57:56,760 --> 00:58:02,200
Yeah, that's like when we did the, when we had like the mock election for 2008 in my

1159
00:58:02,200 --> 00:58:04,720
middle school, there was like four votes for poop.

1160
00:58:04,720 --> 00:58:08,040
That just made me laugh.

1161
00:58:08,040 --> 00:58:10,200
Just four write-in votes for poop.

1162
00:58:10,200 --> 00:58:12,480
Yeah, four separate people.

1163
00:58:12,480 --> 00:58:13,480
Like, yeah, poop.

1164
00:58:13,480 --> 00:58:17,280
Yeah, four, yeah, they did, it was not organized because we led a different write-in campaign

1165
00:58:17,280 --> 00:58:20,960
for Chuck Norris, which won the election.

1166
00:58:20,960 --> 00:58:24,960
There was also, there was four people who just were like...

1167
00:58:24,960 --> 00:58:25,960
Poop.

1168
00:58:25,960 --> 00:58:26,960
That's awesome.

1169
00:58:26,960 --> 00:58:31,960
Yeah, dude, the funniest time of anyone's life.

1170
00:58:31,960 --> 00:58:32,960
2008.

1171
00:58:32,960 --> 00:58:41,680
Yeah, my uncle, who the ghost buster, he, every election cycle goes and votes for Mickey Mouse.

1172
00:58:41,680 --> 00:58:42,680
Yeah.

1173
00:58:42,680 --> 00:58:43,680
That's so awesome.

1174
00:58:43,680 --> 00:58:44,680
So fucking sick, dude.

1175
00:58:44,680 --> 00:58:45,680
Yeah.

1176
00:58:45,680 --> 00:58:46,920
That's what I, I mean, now that's kind of just what I'm going to do.

1177
00:58:46,920 --> 00:58:49,840
I bet Donald Trump is going to vote for Carole Baskin.

1178
00:58:49,840 --> 00:58:50,840
Yeah.

1179
00:58:50,840 --> 00:58:53,520
That's a write-in campaign we can start yeah

1180
00:58:53,520 --> 00:58:57,580
Trump Carol Bauer like when he more like Don Crell

1181
00:58:57,580 --> 00:58:59,960
Basque Trump whoa

1182
00:58:59,960 --> 00:59:05,020
Don't like Don Zolo from Boston. Oh my god

1183
00:59:05,020 --> 00:59:17,920
To like a curtained off half-empty Knicks comedy stop yeah doing it doing everything like trigger happy

1184
00:59:18,200 --> 00:59:22,920
Every single joke just ends with and then the Chinese guy did karate on me

1185
00:59:22,920 --> 00:59:27,580
What does he know his name sounds like Han Solo?

1186
00:59:27,580 --> 00:59:29,800
He does he?

1187
00:59:29,800 --> 00:59:32,920
He does he posts about that sometimes. I think I think

1188
00:59:32,920 --> 00:59:35,680
as a little lines, I

1189
00:59:35,680 --> 00:59:43,160
Like the idea of like oh, it's just his hour is just like 15 different stories of him having sex with

1190
00:59:43,160 --> 00:59:45,800
different trans women and then just feeling tricked

1191
00:59:46,440 --> 00:59:49,600
And he's just like I'll just keep happening to me

1192
00:59:49,600 --> 00:59:55,680
He's that really his whole set. He's like he was like in a

1193
00:59:55,680 --> 00:59:59,000
Dunkin Donuts commercial or something with like Julian Edelman

1194
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:04,400
Dude fucking Gus Gus opened for him and said the best show

1195
01:00:04,400 --> 01:00:08,240
He was like yeah

1196
01:00:08,240 --> 01:00:14,040
Yeah, yeah, I mean he just can't he can't lose dude Don solo. He's a man

1197
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:17,000
All right

1198
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:22,440
Let's see. Let's do let's finish out this list. How's that sound? All right, let's do it number number nine

1199
01:00:22,440 --> 01:00:27,920
set a box set a bell as your ringtone and time it to ring five minutes before the end of your final lesson a

1200
01:00:27,920 --> 01:00:34,200
Student actually did this no kidding. That's one of the comments damn. That's not even a bad idea like

1201
01:00:34,200 --> 01:00:37,100
recording the school's bell and then

1202
01:00:37,100 --> 01:00:43,760
That's an ultimate. Why wait until the five minutes before the end of the final lesson do it five minutes into the first class

1203
01:00:44,760 --> 01:00:48,760
exactly special ability move that's that'll you have to save up your special

1204
01:00:48,760 --> 01:00:53,000
ability that i was something that tricky five magic points

1205
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:59,840
yeah you actually lose h_p_ when you do that yeah it's blood magic

1206
01:00:59,840 --> 01:01:01,120
you ever ten

1207
01:01:01,120 --> 01:01:05,400
jump on the table and do the mock arena while singing tomboys it's okay to be

1208
01:01:05,400 --> 01:01:06,280
gay

1209
01:01:06,280 --> 01:01:08,560
patrick definitely did that

1210
01:01:08,560 --> 01:01:10,680
yes i think that

1211
01:01:10,680 --> 01:01:15,800
Two great songs. Macarena and It's Okay to Be Gay.

1212
01:01:15,800 --> 01:01:20,920
Yeah, someone should do like a girl talk mashup of those two.

1213
01:01:20,920 --> 01:01:25,320
Yeah. That'd be pretty good. I love mashup music, dude.

1214
01:01:25,320 --> 01:01:29,160
I hate when songs are just by themselves.

1215
01:01:29,160 --> 01:01:33,080
I need them to be mixed up with I Love Rock and Roll.

1216
01:01:33,080 --> 01:01:37,240
Which is the one everybody mixes.

1217
01:01:37,240 --> 01:01:41,480
Biggie Smalls and I love rock and roll and that's what mashup music is.

1218
01:01:41,480 --> 01:01:41,980
Yeah.

1219
01:01:41,980 --> 01:01:42,480
It's true.

1220
01:01:42,480 --> 01:01:46,600
Yeah and then my aunt posts, "This is so crazy it works."

1221
01:01:46,600 --> 01:01:47,100
Yeah.

1222
01:01:47,100 --> 01:01:50,280
I actually unironically listen to this.

1223
01:01:50,280 --> 01:01:52,520
I unironically listen to this.

1224
01:01:52,520 --> 01:01:54,840
This is my favorite song unironically.

1225
01:01:54,840 --> 01:01:59,880
There's 20 top comments that say "0,00 free replay button."

1226
01:01:59,880 --> 01:02:06,520
All right, I actually, I know we finished the list but I do want to do this number 11.

1227
01:02:06,520 --> 01:02:07,020
Yeah.

1228
01:02:07,020 --> 01:02:09,260
Fill a bucket, we'll end it here.

1229
01:02:09,260 --> 01:02:12,860
Fill a bucket of balls and tip them down the stairs and yell,

1230
01:02:12,860 --> 01:02:14,060
my balls!

1231
01:02:14,060 --> 01:02:15,420
(laughing)

1232
01:02:15,420 --> 01:02:16,620
- That's pretty good.

1233
01:02:16,620 --> 01:02:17,780
- That's pretty good, dude.

1234
01:02:17,780 --> 01:02:18,620
- Yeah, that's good.

1235
01:02:18,620 --> 01:02:20,100
- If I saw that, that would make me laugh.

1236
01:02:20,100 --> 01:02:24,140
- My balls, I mean, just saying my balls any time

1237
01:02:24,140 --> 01:02:25,660
is pretty good.

1238
01:02:25,660 --> 01:02:28,460
- The band, the new metal band, Snot,

1239
01:02:28,460 --> 01:02:31,100
had shirts that said on the front, my balls,

1240
01:02:31,100 --> 01:02:34,100
and on the back, your chin, which is pretty awesome.

1241
01:02:34,100 --> 01:02:35,580
(laughing)

1242
01:02:35,580 --> 01:02:37,460
'Cause they have a song called "My Balls."

1243
01:02:37,460 --> 01:02:39,980
Do you guys remember that sketch from the state

1244
01:02:39,980 --> 01:02:40,820
where he just--

1245
01:02:40,820 --> 01:02:41,660
Oh, I'm gonna dip my balls in it?

1246
01:02:41,660 --> 01:02:43,820
I'm gonna dip my balls in it.

1247
01:02:43,820 --> 01:02:44,660
No.

1248
01:02:44,660 --> 01:02:45,480
Yeah.

1249
01:02:45,480 --> 01:02:47,100
Oh, mate, that just, that's still,

1250
01:02:47,100 --> 01:02:48,420
that's basically what this is.

1251
01:02:48,420 --> 01:02:50,180
Ken Marino, one of the best dudes.

1252
01:02:50,180 --> 01:02:51,500
Oh, one of the best guys.

1253
01:02:51,500 --> 01:02:52,540
Such a good dude, dude.

1254
01:02:52,540 --> 01:02:54,780
Ken Marino, one of the best comedic minds

1255
01:02:54,780 --> 01:02:55,620
of all time, I feel.

1256
01:02:55,620 --> 01:02:59,060
One of the generational comedic minds.

1257
01:02:59,060 --> 01:03:01,180
Are you kidding, Ron Donald, are you fucking kidding me?

1258
01:03:01,180 --> 01:03:02,660
Ronovan McDonald.

1259
01:03:02,660 --> 01:03:03,660
Donovan Ray?

1260
01:03:03,660 --> 01:03:05,420
Hmm, yeah, pretty good, dude.

1261
01:03:05,420 --> 01:03:08,540
Ray Donovan? Yeah, he's pretty awesome as Ray Donovan.

1262
01:03:08,540 --> 01:03:11,020
He was pretty good as Rayman Raving Rabbids.

1263
01:03:11,020 --> 01:03:13,020
Ken Marino as Ray Donovan?

1264
01:03:13,020 --> 01:03:15,020
[laughter]

1265
01:03:15,020 --> 01:03:20,420
He's just doing his exact character from the Summer Camp movie.

1266
01:03:20,420 --> 01:03:25,220
What is Ray Donovan? He's like an Irish hitman? Hitman?

1267
01:03:25,220 --> 01:03:27,820
Hitman? He's an Irish Pikmin?

1268
01:03:27,820 --> 01:03:29,820
[laughter]

1269
01:03:29,820 --> 01:03:31,820
Yeah, I think he's a Pikmin.

1270
01:03:31,820 --> 01:03:34,820
He's a little alien who follows around a big guy.

1271
01:03:34,820 --> 01:03:38,860
Yeah, but he is Irish. Since we're not reading patrons anymore

1272
01:03:38,860 --> 01:03:42,820
We should just mention the patreon at the end of the episode so people still know it exists.

1273
01:03:42,820 --> 01:03:47,180
I have to buy a new microphone, so please subscribe it. Just subscribe.

1274
01:03:47,180 --> 01:03:50,180
We'll try to figure out a way to thank all the new patrons

1275
01:03:50,180 --> 01:03:54,540
You know what we'll do? We'll make a movie. We'll make a full length movie.

1276
01:03:54,540 --> 01:03:57,220
This will save time. Patrick will write a movie. We'll make a full length movie every single week.

1277
01:03:57,220 --> 01:04:01,360
I'm not writing. I'm actually I'm writing the sequel to Jexy right now.

1278
01:04:01,360 --> 01:04:07,840
So it's called sexy and it's from Patrick's perspective. It's called a boy - yeah, it's called. Yeah, it's called sexy - it's about a sexy

1279
01:04:07,840 --> 01:04:09,840
Two-year-old that you love no
