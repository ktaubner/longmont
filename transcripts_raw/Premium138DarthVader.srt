12
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:45,900
we thought maybe we do a workshop episode today. So this one Patrick is one of those one of

13
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:49,460

14
00:00:49,460 --> 00:00:54,260
animal yeah and it makes a noise. So this is called animal wheels but... I thought it was fighting its cats.

15
00:00:54,260 --> 00:00:57,140
you know what that's what that's actually one of the maybe that's one of the

16
00:00:57,140 --> 00:00:59,700
symbols on the wheel of symbols. The kid turns it yeah like it's like what's

17
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:03,540
this and he turns it and it's a picture of us fighting as yeah yeah that's true

18
00:01:03,540 --> 00:01:04,100
that could be.

19
00:01:04,100 --> 00:01:12,100
The us fighting as cats says.

20
00:01:12,100 --> 00:01:18,820
Get that cat out of here. Get that cat out of here. No i'm fighting the cat.

Not a joke.

39
00:02:44,980 --> 00:02:45,980
No, that's what you meant.

40
00:02:45,980 --> 00:02:46,980
They stole my AirPods.

41
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:47,980
Really?

42
00:02:47,980 --> 00:02:48,980
Mm-hmm.

43
00:02:48,980 --> 00:02:49,980
That's, I'm actually joking.

44
00:02:49,980 --> 00:03:00,980
That would have been so funny to wait until we're recording to tell us that you got mugged.

45
00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:01,980
Also, if someone steals your AirPods, that's...

46
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:02,980
They have a geotag.

47
00:03:02,980 --> 00:03:03,980
You deserve that.

48
00:03:03,980 --> 00:03:04,980
Yeah, you deserve that.

49
00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:05,980
No, they shouldn't have those in the first place.

50
00:03:05,980 --> 00:03:06,980
They have a geotag.

51
00:03:06,980 --> 00:03:07,980
They have a geocache.

52
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:13,380
Geocache yeah, you fall you go to the location on the map you give me my air pods back

53
00:03:13,380 --> 00:03:19,540
I know you have my air pods the geotag. I have the tattle phone app. Yeah, that is true

54
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:24,800
Like what do you what the fuck give those back? Yeah? I got your pods. Yeah, I can't

55
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:30,180
Wired headphones for so long fucking way better. I bought air pods

56
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:37,140
The thing about like everyone I saw these articles like the day that I bought them all these articles came out where it's like our

57
00:03:37,540 --> 00:03:41,980
AirPods out wired earphones are the new thing and it was just like

58
00:03:41,980 --> 00:03:46,140
Lily Rose Depp is wearing wired headphones and you wish that you had

59
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:49,740
you had stayed with the new thing you're kind of mad that you know it's just

60
00:03:49,740 --> 00:04:01,820
yeah I'm saying there was not a bunch of articles that said wire look it up on

61
00:04:01,820 --> 00:04:06,100
the on the on the like stuff he looks like that probably true Google what's

62
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:11,220
cool today. FUD mag. What's the new cool thing today? Yeah. I'm gonna look up what's the cool

63
00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:16,180
thing. How did you find lots of articles about- Because people were complaining about the things.

64
00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:20,980
People like there's like people complain about this shit all the time. Like some 30 year old

65
00:04:20,980 --> 00:04:26,500
complains that like oh like uh Gen Z is like wearing uh Gen Z is wearing stuff that I wore

66
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:29,540
in middle school and now looks stupid. This is skateboarder brain. I know yeah. Skateboarders

67
00:04:29,540 --> 00:04:36,820
are truly the biggest posers in the world. I think I just am. I'll take that I guess.

68
00:04:36,820 --> 00:04:40,740
I was expecting to say there was like an article that said like they fry your brain or something.

69
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:43,300
Well that's what I was expecting. Yeah that's what I was expecting.

70
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:49,540
Bluetooth radiation. Also I feel like you get something and then immediately it's just like

71
00:04:49,540 --> 00:04:52,820
this thing sucks. This thing actually sucks and is bullshit.

72
00:04:52,820 --> 00:04:56,580
But it's not like it was on CNN. It's not like it was breaking news.

73
00:04:56,580 --> 00:05:00,100
I was always more bullshit and sucked those breaking that I don't think you

74
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:03,940
should need an air quality look really stupid look stupid and they are there

75
00:05:03,940 --> 00:05:09,260
don't I'm not I like this I like the spatial audio when I see somebody Apple

76
00:05:09,260 --> 00:05:13,620
music is so good what is spatial audio you don't know non-air pod use it's when

77
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:16,940
you can play it plays a sound only in the left side no you can you can hold

78
00:05:16,940 --> 00:05:21,460
you can hold it down and it noise cancels and then you hear a threat so it

79
00:05:21,460 --> 00:05:25,740
it sounds like it's in 360. What does that mean? It sounds like I just love

80
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:31,380
360. You hate technology. I love technology. You don't. I love new apps. You do like new

81
00:05:31,380 --> 00:05:36,620
apps. You do, that's true. I love new apps and I love new games. Yeah. I just don't,

82
00:05:36,620 --> 00:05:41,300
I do still mentally detract kind of points when I meet somebody for the first time and

83
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:45,300
they have AirPods on. Definitely. For me, yeah, I can't stand Bluetooth headphones in

84
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:49,500
general. I think that it is, I think it is the stupidest thing ever that people were

85
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:53,380
like like that that these companies are like oh we're making new headphones but

86
00:05:53,380 --> 00:05:57,860
that you have to charge and people are like oh I want that I'll pay more money

87
00:05:57,860 --> 00:06:02,740
for that well I think it's actually so the audio quality is actually pretty

88
00:06:02,740 --> 00:06:07,540
good but that doesn't it doesn't matter you're still there's nice useless the

89
00:06:07,540 --> 00:06:10,980
ones that are the what the ones that are no it's not useless you can walk away

90
00:06:10,980 --> 00:06:14,340
from whatever it's connected to just have your phone in your pocket

91
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:18,300
somebody's not a runner now I am or I've run and I would just hold my phone or

92
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:22,780
put in my pocket. That's the one thing that I would think that is useful for.

93
00:06:22,780 --> 00:06:25,540
But when I see like people like on the train with them or something or even just

94
00:06:25,540 --> 00:06:28,540
like sitting at your computer with them. Also, you can be complete... Alright, here's honestly the

95
00:06:28,540 --> 00:06:33,900
benefit of a Bluetooth headphones. You can sit, you can be completely naked and

96
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:37,660
that's true. And you do stuff with your hands in your house and still have headphones in.

97
00:06:37,660 --> 00:06:42,780
That is true. Sometimes I wish I could have a pocket on my underwear. I could have a pocket on my underwear.

98
00:06:42,780 --> 00:06:46,340
Well, I'm not gonna say that Bluetooth headphones are completely useless.

99
00:06:46,340 --> 00:06:50,080
I used to do it. I think it's very stupid. I used to clench my phone between my butt

100
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:54,180
cheeks while I do the dishes. Yeah, that's pretty sick. And now I don't have to do

101
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:58,120
that anymore. Yeah, I mostly, I usually when I'm in that situation I just, I just

102
00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:02,020
play, I just don't use headphones. I don't, I actually don't like wired

103
00:07:02,020 --> 00:07:05,540
headphones at all. I'm thinking about every time that I've worn wired

104
00:07:05,540 --> 00:07:10,700
headphones and I've been trying to do something and it's just like, like me

105
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:14,120
going on the train and then getting like stuck in that the wire gets stuck in the

106
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:15,120
turnstile.

107
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:24,120
I don't think that's ever happened to me.

108
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:30,160
No, it happens to me on doorknobs, but in the turnstile, what are you doing on the turnstile

109
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:31,680
that the wire gets caught?

110
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:33,840
Well, I'm trying to slide it.

111
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:34,840
I'm trying to go through.

112
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:36,400
You're trying to slide it into the space to the side of it.

113
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:37,400
And then...

114
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:41,800
Yeah, I just hate when it gets like, when I'm using wired headphones and the wire gets

115
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:45,160
get caught in the door handle of a taxi driving by and I get dragged along for

116
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:49,000
ten blocks. Yeah, when I get when I'm falling out of a window and my wireless

117
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,360
headphones, I actually catch a gargoyle on the corner like that, because I

118
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:54,120
survive. I don't like that.

119
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:59,120
Yeah, when the door or the turn style pulls that out of the headphone jack and

120
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:03,460
then your headphone jack doesn't work anymore. I do I can't bring out the

121
00:08:03,460 --> 00:08:03,720
whole

122
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:06,080
subway station. They take

123
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:13,440
yeah it's annoying yeah yeah have you guys ever had the the i think that's as

124
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:17,920
embarrassing as having your pants pulled down is having your phone unplugged yeah

125
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:22,640
this and remember back when stuff would just keep playing yeah yeah touch when

126
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:26,080
stuff would just yeah what the worst part is when they don't pull when that

127
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:29,200
doesn't get pulled out and yeah your headphone jack is like partially broken

128
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:32,560
and it's every once in a while just play a snippet yeah just out loud and then go

129
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:37,680
back to the wire headphones do the it and you have to like twist it yeah but

130
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:39,520
but that doesn't do that anymore.

131
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:42,680
- What's the most embarrassing thing that you can,

132
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:43,920
besides like porn.

133
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:46,320
- Probably peeing my pants and pooping on the floor.

134
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:48,080
- As a, no, I mean a sound.

135
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:48,920
- Naked.

136
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:50,520
- Admitting to your crush. - Naked in court.

137
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:52,720
- Admitting that one time I peed and pooped.

138
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:54,440
- Admitting that you love your crush in court

139
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:55,480
while you pee your pants.

140
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:57,520
- Your headphones, your headphones,

141
00:08:57,520 --> 00:08:59,920
they like come out and you just hear your voice

142
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:01,600
coming from under like,

143
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:03,720
later, earlier I peed on the floor

144
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:09,600
I pooped all over the floor in my into my pants and I hope my crush doesn't and my

145
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:16,080
crush is Veronica and I really want to eat pee and poop and I don't know why I

146
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:21,720
recorded this and I recorded it so loud so everyone could it in a super volume

147
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:27,240
oh no my bluetooth speaker accidentally connected to my phone yeah my headphones

148
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:31,400
came out and it defaulted to the giant boom box on my back all completely

149
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:35,600

Can I speak? Didn't you see Fart Weekly said that one dude sucks?

158
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:10,980
Well, continue. The guy he had like music playing from his Bluetooth speaker, but he was going like

159
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:16,200
It was one guy. It was one guy in a group of guys, and he was going to the thing

160
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:20,160
He was going to like a spot so that he could like go and then skate this ledge

161
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:24,180
So he was playing this song and all you could hear like he would go away and all you'd hear is like

162
00:10:24,180 --> 00:10:26,180
*imitates the music*

163
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:28,560
Yeah, like dance hall stuff. Whoa

164
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:37,200
Like see not no like why don't you just leave us his phones in his pocket? Why doesn't he just leave it there?

165
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:40,720
I really that he was cool. I think that people who play

166
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:45,660
Speaker music on the street are like crazier than the craziest like I know

167
00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:49,680
I can't imagine like wanting to do that

168
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:54,400
Yeah, the worst thing now is like the music what the music was like bad

169
00:10:54,680 --> 00:11:00,160
But now it's like you can like go somewhere and it's just somebody watching like tick tocks on full volume

170
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:07,240
And on the train and you hear like like yeah, this is my new car or like yeah

171
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:09,040
I'm like that tick-tock

172
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:11,120
I just it to me like like that that sucks

173
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:15,040
But I can least I can at least understand where it's like oh, I have my phone and I'm doing something

174
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:15,320
Yeah

175
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:17,160
like when I see so like there'll be like

176
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:23,920
Somebody like bikes by and they have like a blue tooth for my kids in their backpack like playing their their favorite music

177
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:28,220
music that everyone that's safer than having headphones in as a yeah bike in

178
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:31,020
that you kind of that makes I guess okay when you're biking I guess that makes

179
00:11:31,020 --> 00:11:34,620
sense but it's still just the people walking to it just is weird to be all

180
00:11:34,620 --> 00:11:38,220
completely alone I guess that the thing you're doing I guess the argument would

181
00:11:38,220 --> 00:11:41,720
be like that's what like if you're like I guess I just wouldn't be listening I

182
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:45,120
wouldn't listen to music if it was between wearing head not a bike wearing

183
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:49,220
headphones and playing a speaker I would do that I need to listen to my music

184
00:11:49,220 --> 00:11:53,620
every day you need your tunes I'm on I'm on a no I'm on a no music break really

185
00:11:53,620 --> 00:11:59,300
music break. A no music break. Hell, I'm on a no music break. I'm having, I have

186
00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:02,220
nothing playing in my headphones. I'll leave my headphones at home for the next

187
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:06,660
couple of days. Yeah. Yeah, I'm sick of just, just walking around. I'm just, all

188
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:10,220
I'm thinking about is these fucking Blondie songs I'm listening to. I just

189
00:12:10,220 --> 00:12:15,220
don't like them. I love, I found all my Pet Shop Boys remixes. Nice. That I made.

190
00:12:15,220 --> 00:12:20,180
Very cool. Yeah. I've been listening to those. It's such a drag to pick what

191
00:12:20,180 --> 00:12:21,520
- I like listening to music to listen to.

192
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:24,420
I like listening to music while I'm walking around,

193
00:12:24,420 --> 00:12:26,900
but that's the reason I would take it.

194
00:12:26,900 --> 00:12:27,900
- There's walking around music

195
00:12:27,900 --> 00:12:31,000
and then there's at home music.

196
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,980
- I don't think that's necessarily true.

197
00:12:32,980 --> 00:12:34,720
- I never listen to music at home.

198
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:37,680
- I listen to music, yeah, I guess I don't,

199
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:39,580
I listen to music much more when I'm walking around,

200
00:12:39,580 --> 00:12:41,780
but also I'll listen to music when I'm doing the dishes

201
00:12:41,780 --> 00:12:43,240
or some really menial thing.

202
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:44,880
- Do you not just sit there and listen, what the hell?

203
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:46,520
- 'Cause I usually watch movies or like,

204
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:48,100
actually I listen to music when I read.

205
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:52,740
I do that's probably the most I have it on constantly. Yeah, I think I have to shower

206
00:12:52,740 --> 00:12:58,020
with music on. I know it's very funny. Yeah, it is funny to be a grown man who showers with music.

207
00:12:58,020 --> 00:13:02,180
I don't care. It's just funny every time because every time that we're all three of us are together

208
00:13:02,180 --> 00:13:06,420
somewhere and you're like, I'm going to take a quick shower and then I just hear all the

209
00:13:06,420 --> 00:13:12,100
I don't listen to Blink 182 in the shower. What do you listen to in the shower?

210
00:13:17,620 --> 00:13:21,980
You need to listen to a song that's like, first you wash your hair,

211
00:13:21,980 --> 00:13:23,980
then you wash your face.

212
00:13:23,980 --> 00:13:25,980
Yeah, what? I'm just listening to my music.

213
00:13:25,980 --> 00:13:27,980
This is my favorite song.

214
00:13:27,980 --> 00:13:29,980
Time to turn the shower off.

215
00:13:29,980 --> 00:13:34,620
And then you hear Patrick go, "I don't want to turn the shower off! I'm not done!"

216
00:13:34,620 --> 00:13:36,620
You start the song.

217
00:13:36,620 --> 00:13:40,620
Yeah, the song restarts and then I turn the shower off, and the song restarts.

218
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:42,620
You turn the shower on.

219
00:13:42,620 --> 00:13:44,620
You turn the shower on.

220
00:13:44,620 --> 00:13:49,620
shower on. I don't have any clean you get shampoo. You put it on your hair.

221
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:57,540
Then you wash your hair. Then you don't check off in the shower that will take

222
00:13:57,540 --> 00:14:00,580
too long and clog the drain. Patrick does a homer doe

223
00:14:00,580 --> 00:14:07,320
unless you're the only one who uses the shower, but it's still kind of gross.

224
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:07,980
Whoa

225
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:10,920
yeah

226
00:14:12,020 --> 00:14:18,820
Yeah, I don't know like I think that it's good to have music on in the shower. I don't think there's anything wrong with it

227
00:14:18,820 --> 00:14:20,820
It's all funny. It's I

228
00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:23,920
It's yeah, I think it's a normal thing to do. I think the thing that's funny

229
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:27,260
Was that you were doing it at someone else's house. That's what made me laugh to do it

230
00:14:27,260 --> 00:14:33,220
It's like boring in there, but that's that's the good part of the shower. That's why people come up with good ideas in the show

231
00:14:33,220 --> 00:14:37,140
Yeah, I do genuinely do come up with good ideas that it's crazy

232
00:14:37,700 --> 00:14:43,820
That's true that I most of my good ideas. I feel because I just heard somebody talk about this the other day

233
00:14:43,820 --> 00:14:48,200
It's like that's like the closest the waking person gets to being like

234
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:53,580
Like that the 30 minutes before you fall asleep where you're sitting in bed. That's a little bit of shower

235
00:14:53,580 --> 00:14:55,840
I think it's also cuz like a constant state of that

236
00:14:55,840 --> 00:15:00,440
I think that like when coming up with ideas is easier like if you do it regularly

237
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:04,900
I guess like it's like a they they do like creativity studies or whatever where it's like

238
00:15:04,900 --> 00:15:08,580
oh if you like try to write at the same time every day yeah and you'll it'll get

239
00:15:08,580 --> 00:15:11,260
better you'll get better at it and it'll be easier to come up with stuff and then

240
00:15:11,260 --> 00:15:13,700
you just if you're always in the shower when the when you're in the shower you

241
00:15:13,700 --> 00:15:16,500
know I have to think of ideas and they think like what if there's a crazy

242
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:19,900
invention that could change the world I'm trying to really most of my ideas I

243
00:15:19,900 --> 00:15:23,100
just gotta leave my penis in my balls alone on the shower because I'll just sit

244
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:26,700
there no I'm speed bagging I'm yeah just smack them back and forth I'm just doing

245
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:31,300
different stuff in the shower of course I have come on you got that never have

246
00:15:31,300 --> 00:15:33,300
sticky racing stripe down your leg.

247
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:35,540
(laughing)

248
00:15:35,540 --> 00:15:36,780
- I don't think I have.

249
00:15:36,780 --> 00:15:39,100
- It's really, it's definitely something that

250
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:41,180
I probably did as a teen and then realized,

251
00:15:41,180 --> 00:15:43,260
oh, this is actually like so nasty.

252
00:15:43,260 --> 00:15:46,860
- How cruel is God that he makes hot water

253
00:15:46,860 --> 00:15:49,740
do a science experiment when it touches cum?

254
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:50,780
- Yeah, it's crazy.

255
00:15:50,780 --> 00:15:51,620
- What the fuck is that?

256
00:15:51,620 --> 00:15:52,460
- It's crazy what it does.

257
00:15:52,460 --> 00:15:53,780
- What, like, it turns into--

258
00:15:53,780 --> 00:15:55,260
- It's literally oobleck.

259
00:15:55,260 --> 00:15:56,820
- It actually is, dude.

260
00:15:56,820 --> 00:15:59,900
That is like the cruelest fact of nature,

261
00:15:59,900 --> 00:16:04,780
is that when hot water touches come, it turns into super glue immediately.

262
00:16:04,780 --> 00:16:07,680
That's how you know God didn't want us jacking off in the shower. Absolutely,

263
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:11,400
yeah. If you have somehow the like endurance, the like tenacity to jack off

264
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:15,420
in a cold shower, yeah, then you are to you. The first time I ever heard the

265
00:16:15,420 --> 00:16:20,640
word gelatinous was on the bus when like a kid was, my friend was like talking

266
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:25,140
about jacking off in the shower and he's like, yeah, just make sure like you're

267
00:16:25,140 --> 00:16:27,640
not facing the water or else it'll become gelatinous.

268
00:16:28,180 --> 00:16:32,260
I was like what does that mean? I thought that no you have to do is you

269
00:16:32,260 --> 00:16:34,980
have to you have to peek open the shower curtain a little and just come on to

270
00:16:34,980 --> 00:16:35,500
the best

271
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:37,000
come on to your

272
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:42,000
doors cracked open to see a little like

273
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:49,500
and off to the floor bath, aiming into the toilet and then you get out of the

274
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:52,300
shower. Do you just step on it? You're a shag bath

275
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:58,700
oh damn that's just that bit was actually good though dude I'm that would be a

276
00:16:58,700 --> 00:17:02,260
good bit the bits in the riffs today or just you know it's all do we think we

277
00:17:02,260 --> 00:17:05,660
come up with any good bits or riffs so far that we could maybe use I think this

278
00:17:05,660 --> 00:17:09,740
is the we're gonna delete this episode after we got it I gotta ask myself

279
00:17:09,740 --> 00:17:16,580
delete this episode after I got it I doubted myself as a huge poser I'm a

280
00:17:16,580 --> 00:17:23,060
huge poser it's cool to admit it now actually I really know poser is actually

281
00:17:23,060 --> 00:17:26,620
it's like based these days. Yeah, it's actually based as fuck to be a poser.

282
00:17:26,620 --> 00:17:30,340
That is based as fuck to be a shrub. That's a good bit. What was that?

283
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:33,660
Saying it's based to be a poser? Yeah. That's actually a good bit. Yeah,

284
00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:36,780
that's a might be a good riff. I love this bit. If you take it to another

285
00:17:36,780 --> 00:17:39,660
level, it could be a good riff. What the hell? No, it's not a riff. It's

286
00:17:39,660 --> 00:17:42,580
more of a bit. No, riffing is what you do to a bit. Riffing is like...

287
00:17:42,580 --> 00:17:46,140
What's the difference? Riffing is like the funny ass shit that follows a

288
00:17:46,140 --> 00:17:50,100
good ass bit. Yeah. Shit. And it... Riffing, like...

289
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:56,940
bits are actually good, but riffing whip sack when it happens. Okay, I'm starting

290
00:17:56,940 --> 00:18:02,060
to understand a little more. I think yeah, Dr Pepper whips asked Dr Pepper does

291
00:18:02,060 --> 00:18:06,940
you and I fuckin what the thing about like brutalist architecture is it

292
00:18:06,940 --> 00:18:11,140
actually whip sack to twenty eighteen is just like the worst time for language

293
00:18:11,140 --> 00:18:15,940
and every white person. I would have said that whips ass bro. Oh, you're

294
00:18:15,940 --> 00:18:19,860
worried about white people using language wrong. I would have personally

295
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:24,680
in the antebellum south but go ahead I would have said that was the worst time

296
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:29,260
for language do the horrific racial epithets that people were hurling what's

297
00:18:29,260 --> 00:18:36,620
an epithet I'm gonna you may say what you put on your gravestone you say yeah

298
00:18:36,620 --> 00:18:43,700
WAP. Wappy Wapper. That actually made me very sad. Okay that's actually a good bit.

299
00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:49,200
Actually made me very sad to hear that yeah makes me sad too yeah I you know we

300
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:54,560
having fun. I think I've discovered an underground Polish mafia.

301
00:18:54,560 --> 00:19:00,480
You know what I saw today? I've been getting these DMs from a crazy person.

302
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:06,080
He sends me like full-on, like I've showed you him, the German guy.

303
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:11,480
He sends a selfie and then he sends, like he's an older man, and then

304
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:15,960
he sends me a bunch of stuff about how his rights in Germany are being

305
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:21,540
stripped or something yeah and he sent me something today and he said like it said

306
00:19:21,540 --> 00:19:27,100
like good evening blah blah blah per me and and then he tagged somebody and

307
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:33,400
their at was Polack hunter and I was like what and I clicked it and it was a guy

308
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:44,820
named hunter Polack holy shit it's crazy I was like that's like Kevin Pollak yeah

309
00:19:44,820 --> 00:19:50,540
spelled like that okay that's hilarious dude it was the fuck cuz I thought that

310
00:19:50,540 --> 00:19:55,920
like oh this guy must be involved with some like racist yeah yeah but no his

that long civil servants have been active against me without empathy from

336
00:22:08,060 --> 00:22:13,940
bullying to provoked accident in 1996 90% severely cured that's 26 years of

337
00:22:13,940 --> 00:22:19,660
discrimination so far the thugs and criminals and then he tagged somebody

338
00:22:19,660 --> 00:22:29,980
interest is I have to shit yeah he's cool dude this guy rocks I thought it would

339

yeah he's way older that's his full life oh my this guy's a spy yeah look at his

342
00:22:44,100 --> 00:22:48,700
fucking face he's trying to get sent back home they have been yeah they

343
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:53,100
abandoned I guess whatever country he was a spy for dissolved I guess he had an

344
00:22:53,100 --> 00:23:00,340
accident in 1996 and he's 90% completely cured of what does it specify injury oh

345
00:23:00,340 --> 00:23:05,660
well that's nice yeah how what percentage of the population is people

346
00:23:05,660 --> 00:23:09,820
like this at this point I don't know and what is doing everybody doing this to

347
00:23:09,820 --> 00:23:15,180
people everybody's been so MK altered into into living like this what does

348
00:23:15,180 --> 00:23:16,700
does that mean I don't know

349
00:23:16,700 --> 00:23:23,880
I was just making stuff up. I thought that I would just make it up and then

350
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:25,040
we we just move on.

351
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:33,140
I thought that we'd you know, it's been so in kale. I look you can just

352
00:23:33,140 --> 00:23:36,680
throw words around your you're right. I mean that basically, but that's that's

353
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:40,260
that's passable yeah. I think that's a that's a that's a made up statement

354
00:23:40,260 --> 00:23:45,060
that's worth moving past. I think that counts yeah, yeah, there's no reason a

355
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:46,180
lot of things. There's a lot of

356
00:23:46,180 --> 00:23:48,180
basic. It's basically true. It's

357
00:23:48,180 --> 00:23:50,080
blank. Sure, basically true. Yeah,

358
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:52,180
it's true enough to accept yeah

359
00:23:52,180 --> 00:23:53,780
yeah. A lot of statements. I make

360
00:23:53,780 --> 00:23:55,200
that could be passed on

361
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:57,500
that we think we just get a little

362
00:23:57,500 --> 00:23:59,600
up on just drilling to

363
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:01,200
yeah. I'm willing to let this one

364
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:03,200
slide. Yeah, all right. If we have

365
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:05,100
you, it is crazy that people just

366
00:24:05,100 --> 00:24:06,200
are mk altered

367
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:09,400
to live like this. You know that

368
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:11,400
this bit is going too far. Sorry,

369
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:13,100
that's a bad. Yeah, the bit is I

370
00:24:13,100 --> 00:24:16,540
I tried to riff on the bit and it was yeah, you just can't do it. Yeah, I

371
00:24:16,540 --> 00:24:20,340
wonder I it's already complete. I bet that like I feel like five percent of

372
00:24:20,340 --> 00:24:23,340
the people who act like that actually there's actually is something going on.

373
00:24:23,340 --> 00:24:27,700
Yeah, yeah, I know I just believe I would I would sooner believe him. I

374
00:24:27,700 --> 00:24:31,900
think yeah, I mean that's that like people it doesn't have to be the

375
00:24:31,900 --> 00:24:35,220
government. That's the thing people get like are mean and bully other people

376
00:24:35,220 --> 00:24:39,100
and if everyone bullies you probably think that everyone's you know, you'd

377
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:43,920
probably break your brain pretty watch a lot of targeted individual videos. I

378
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:47,720
think you become one one day. Yeah, yeah, I think if you watch a bunch of them,

379
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:51,220
yeah, I think like that living like that. I think that's what you do is you

380
00:24:51,220 --> 00:24:54,520
spend all day being like, oh, that's it's funny that people are like that and

381
00:24:54,520 --> 00:24:57,520
then one of them make some amount of sense to you and you're done. Yeah,

382
00:24:57,520 --> 00:25:00,220
exactly. You have to be really careful. It's the same. It's the same with

383
00:25:00,220 --> 00:25:04,420
morgulans stuff. Yeah, there's you can't let that stuff get to you have to eat

384
00:25:04,420 --> 00:25:08,020
like whether even if it is real, you can't believe that it's real or else it

385
00:25:08,020 --> 00:25:13,940
happen to you yeah there was a guy I used to watch in middle school who was like a

386
00:25:13,940 --> 00:25:19,140
targeted an individual who believed he was a reincarnation of Hitler really yeah

387
00:25:19,140 --> 00:25:22,740
and he said that like Steven Spielberg and everybody were in the CIA and they

388
00:25:22,740 --> 00:25:26,500
were watching it was just a skit wait he's reincarnated so what did he was he

389
00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:32,100
like sorry yeah was it he was he happy I don't know he didn't really talk too

390
00:25:32,100 --> 00:25:35,220
much see that would be my I would say the only there was a video of him

391
00:25:35,220 --> 00:25:40,740
microwaving a steak though that's how I found out about him he microwaves a

392
00:25:40,740 --> 00:25:46,060
steak and he says like it's the juiciest thing I've ever eaten. That's the best

393
00:25:46,060 --> 00:25:50,660
part is that as when they those people also live normal lives like or like

394
00:25:50,660 --> 00:25:56,220
semi normal lives. Oh he didn't live a normal life. He lived in a tent. Like just see like less than that but more just like

395
00:25:56,220 --> 00:25:59,500
seeing what else they do like like when you go to their YouTube channel and they

396
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:02,620
have like you know like a hundred videos that are like the CIA is killing me with

397
00:26:02,620 --> 00:26:06,220
rays and then in between you'll see a video that's like me singing my

398
00:26:06,220 --> 00:26:09,660
favorite song and it's just them like like it's so that's the better fly. I

399
00:26:09,660 --> 00:26:13,580
saw on the street. Yeah, what am I do you guys remember this the targeted

400
00:26:13,580 --> 00:26:18,140
individual guy who said that the CIA stole his penis? No, that he used to

401
00:26:18,140 --> 00:26:21,500
have like he used to have a twelve inch penis and the CIA actually the CIA

402
00:26:21,500 --> 00:26:24,380
stole it and replaced it with like a four inch penis or something. Yeah,

403
00:26:24,380 --> 00:26:30,140
that's the CIA stole it and they're using it to fuck people. Yeah, yeah,

404
00:26:30,140 --> 00:26:33,940
And he didn't have like a bunch of shit taped on his walls or I think so.

405
00:26:33,940 --> 00:26:37,640
Yeah. Yeah, and I think there was maybe some race stuff in there, too.

406
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:39,540
That was maybe a super awesome.

407
00:26:39,540 --> 00:26:43,540
Yeah, but just the thing of like, yeah, they stole my penis.

408
00:26:43,540 --> 00:26:47,640
You know why because they wanted to fuck people with yeah, it's so funny.

409
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:49,140
They don't want me to fuck people with it.

410
00:26:49,140 --> 00:26:55,640
They wanted to fuck the also fuck people like screw them over is like a cooler way to fit like they need his penis.

411
00:26:55,640 --> 00:26:58,560
so they need his penis to ruin someone's life.

412
00:26:58,560 --> 00:26:59,760
- Yeah. - Yeah.

413
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:01,160

00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:05,440
- Have you sitting up in the house

417
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:07,360

418
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:09,480
- Yup, yup. - Okay, that bit actually.

419
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:12,920
- The CIA, the CIA is using good dick

420
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:15,320
to ruin bad bitches' lives. - It's true.

421
00:27:15,320 --> 00:27:16,160
(laughing)

422
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:18,320
- That is true, yeah.

423
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:19,360
- Some true shit.

424
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:20,760
- Yeah, that moment where you're like,

425
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:24,280

426
00:27:24,280 --> 00:27:25,440
- Buh-ding. - Yup.

427
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:30,800
and then I check my phone like bro yeah, it's fucking true man.

428
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:42,400
It's like a it's like a Cia like it's like a guy and like a classic like spy

429
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:45,920
outfit with like a suit and like shades and so but it's with a giant

430
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:58,340
think about like a briefcase and stuff - yeah his briefcase is filled to the

431
00:27:58,340 --> 00:28:04,920
brim with Magnum condoms yeah you ever think about how like like some of some

432
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:08,700
of the like weirdest people are blessed with the like biggest Pete like Ron

433
00:28:08,700 --> 00:28:14,680
Jeremy got a big penis looks like he's definitely we think that good people

434
00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:20,140
have little penis yes yeah I probably I think that's true yeah I think bad

435
00:28:20,140 --> 00:28:25,260
people have big penises yeah I think having a big penis cause you to be a bad

436
00:28:25,260 --> 00:28:28,940
person absolutely cuz you get to you get to confident you don't you don't build

437
00:28:28,940 --> 00:28:33,980
your own kind of personality you know and and also you never learn how to how to

438
00:28:33,980 --> 00:28:38,700
actually I know what there is some exceptions no there's no exceptions if

439
00:28:38,700 --> 00:28:46,380
you have a big penis Tyler bad person I do have a friend I don't know anybody I

440
00:28:46,380 --> 00:28:53,420
You have a friend who's brother has like a friend of mine his older brother has

441
00:28:53,420 --> 00:28:58,700
like had just a scary big penis and we we see big penises are fucking terrifying

442
00:28:58,700 --> 00:29:02,580
he's just see it he would like a shower and he would like go was like fall out

443
00:29:02,580 --> 00:29:07,220
of the bottom of his fucking towel and she's we just be like we're terrified

444
00:29:07,220 --> 00:29:12,380
yeah yeah yeah do you know scary I think he works as an engineer or something

445
00:29:12,380 --> 00:29:14,380
Probably for the CIA.

446
00:29:14,380 --> 00:29:17,380
Is it R. Crumb? Robert Crumb? I was watching that documentary.

447
00:29:17,380 --> 00:29:19,380
Apparently he's like hung.

448
00:29:19,380 --> 00:29:21,380
That's pretty funny.

449
00:29:21,380 --> 00:29:25,380
He's hung like crazy but he only gets off if he gets a piggyback ride.

450
00:29:25,380 --> 00:29:26,380
Yeah.

451
00:29:26,380 --> 00:29:27,380
Which they say in the movie.

452
00:29:27,380 --> 00:29:28,380
That's awesome.

453
00:29:28,380 --> 00:29:32,380
That's the way you can be a... I mean I guess he probably wasn't that good of a person was he?

454
00:29:32,380 --> 00:29:36,380
No. I mean look at how he drew black people. That's not good.

455
00:29:36,380 --> 00:29:40,540
But maybe that's the key is that if you can shortcut being a bad person if you

456
00:29:40,540 --> 00:29:45,720
have some horrible fetish that yeah that that humbles you like like he's into

457
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:50,220
like women who are like seven feet tall like he likes he likes Bigfoot - yeah

458
00:29:50,220 --> 00:29:54,380
yeah yeah he likes to like there's that scene where he's like I was sexually

459
00:29:54,380 --> 00:30:02,940
attracted to Bugs Bunny I like bought it I was like yeah I'm gonna watch this

461
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:14,440

462
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:19,160
Yeah. I like kissing a girl. I know it's kind of scary and fucked up but like. I like kissing

463
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:23,320
my girlfriend as a fetish. I like to see my wiener disappear inside someone's body. Yeah.

464
00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:27,840
Just making it go away. Alright. You know what time it is? It's time to make my wiener

465
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:34,240
go away inside your body. Alright, I have to make my next trick. And every time I'm praying

466
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:42,580
that I go to pull it and there's nothing there. It sucks it up and it's gone. They should suck

467
00:30:42,580 --> 00:30:48,480
up your penis, that should be sex. You should only have sex one time like a spider. Yeah,

468
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:52,440
like the tube at the bank. Yeah, exactly. Like the tube at the bank, which my dad used

469
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:56,600
one of those tubes so bad. The penis grows in. My dad used to talk about it all the time.

470
00:30:56,600 --> 00:31:00,200
dad would talk he'd be like we need to get one of those tubes installed in our

471
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:03,640
house so that we can send beer to the living room from the kitchen that's sick

472
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:06,680
and it'd be like that'd be the most fucked up beer in the world when you opened it.

473
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:11,240
Yeah, it goes up, it goes up, it like goes around a bend immediately shatters and

474
00:31:11,240 --> 00:31:16,320
that just shoots broken glass into the living room. It kills my mom.

475
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:20,200
You put a beer bottle in it and it just goes *swoosh*. Like Doc Ock's eye.

476
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:25,080
Just shards of glass directly in her eye. I'm thinking about that penis thing where it

477
00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:29,580
like goes into like that's how it should work this thing where it goes in it goes

478
00:31:29,580 --> 00:31:32,920
in and out thinking about that penis thing where it goes in and out although

479
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:38,260
like goes up like a vacuum tube so like the size of your penis will determine

480
00:31:38,260 --> 00:31:46,600
the size of your child so if it goes in right here's here's here's my like the

481
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:50,480
raw material so it's like when you get those little dinosaurs yeah in the

482
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:56,360
capsule and it unfolds gonna get whatever multitude larger mm-hmm so

483
00:31:56,360 --> 00:32:01,080
basically your penis becomes so in this scenario your penis is a little guy yeah

484
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:07,520
or girl okay depends but you only get to use it once is it like stone still or is

485
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:12,600
it like alive it's I mean dead until it's like it's like the capsule with the

486
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:16,820
dinosaur great so it's not real okay then so it's not real it's made of a

487
00:32:16,820 --> 00:32:20,860
sponge. Okay. Maybe it's alive in there but it's a waxy coating. But it's showing you what

488
00:32:20,860 --> 00:32:26,380
it's gonna look like. It still looks like a penis. I was thinking maybe you could see what

489
00:32:26,380 --> 00:32:31,820
your son would look like. No, no it still looks like a penis. But there's like certain things

490
00:32:31,820 --> 00:32:34,980
like you look at it and you're like oh the head's a little big I think he's gonna have

491
00:32:34,980 --> 00:32:41,980
a big head. Oh, so it follows the characteristics of your penis. Yeah. And then it goes in and

492
00:32:41,980 --> 00:32:43,460
and then it goes in and it grows in mommy

493
00:32:43,460 --> 00:32:45,100
and then it comes out nine months later.

494
00:32:45,100 --> 00:32:45,940
- Yeah.

495
00:32:45,940 --> 00:32:46,780
- It goes into mommy?

496
00:32:46,780 --> 00:32:47,780
- It goes into mommy.

497
00:32:47,780 --> 00:32:48,620
- Okay.

498
00:32:48,620 --> 00:32:51,980
All right, I'm starting to get it.

499
00:32:51,980 --> 00:32:56,980
What if your penis had red skin and horns?

500
00:32:56,980 --> 00:32:58,100
- Oh no.

501
00:32:58,100 --> 00:32:59,420
- Chomp it off.

502
00:32:59,420 --> 00:33:00,260
- What would you do?

503
00:33:00,260 --> 00:33:02,220
- What if it looked like a Bulbasaur?

504
00:33:02,220 --> 00:33:04,140
- Get that penis off of there.

505
00:33:04,140 --> 00:33:04,980
- Yeah.

506
00:33:04,980 --> 00:33:05,820
- Get that penis off my body.

507
00:33:05,820 --> 00:33:07,100
- Since I broke my toe, I've been getting so,

508
00:33:07,100 --> 00:33:08,620
back into Pokemon so hard.

509
00:33:08,620 --> 00:33:09,820
- That makes no sense 'cause I feel like

510
00:33:09,820 --> 00:33:11,660
you wouldn't wanna walk around very much

00:33:11,660 --> 00:33:16,980

00:33:47,180 --> 00:33:48,180
Yeah.

525
00:33:48,180 --> 00:33:49,860
No, this one's about a ninja fighting Samurai.

526
00:33:49,860 --> 00:33:51,700
Shadow's kind of a ninja if you think about it.

527
00:33:51,700 --> 00:33:54,420
I'm doing a full dopamine fest.

528
00:33:54,420 --> 00:33:55,420
Yeah.

529
00:33:55,420 --> 00:34:00,500
No music, no movies, no video games, no TV show, no food, no water.

530
00:34:00,500 --> 00:34:02,140
Team Rocket Gym.

531
00:34:02,140 --> 00:34:03,140
Team Rocket Poke Stop.

I'm not going to.

533
00:34:04,900 --> 00:34:05,900
Not right now.

534
00:34:05,900 --> 00:34:09,400
now but I figure it out I think you got to catch a cat real quick yeah I gotta

535
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:13,900
catch this cat the spring what's its name this is what is this glam meow

536
00:34:13,900 --> 00:34:18,740
glam mixing in normal animal yeah the glam meow fled so they don't have any

537
00:34:18,740 --> 00:34:22,100
normal animals in Pokemon kind of there's some that are just birds and

538
00:34:22,100 --> 00:34:25,860
cats and stuff I mean they're not but they're not called bird but yeah that's

539
00:34:25,860 --> 00:34:31,100
what they don't have like there's not a bird or a dog there is a few dogs like

540
00:34:31,100 --> 00:34:33,980
they don't you know what you know what there's one called there's one called

541
00:34:33,980 --> 00:34:40,380
crabby that's a crab so does is our humans the only animals that had a

542
00:34:40,380 --> 00:34:46,260
normal evolution are they the only animals yeah so yeah so is the god of

543
00:34:46,260 --> 00:34:50,620
all Pokemon yeah but that's like before that what and like just one Pokemon like

544
00:34:50,620 --> 00:34:53,340
came out or everyone they're making a show before they had this whole like

545
00:34:53,340 --> 00:34:57,580
mythology thing and it it's really you can like look up you can they have like

546
00:34:57,580 --> 00:35:03,220
you can read parts of the like style guide for the show and it's like yeah you

547
00:35:03,220 --> 00:35:07,380
can never show an animal that's not a Pokemon because it will make the world

548
00:35:07,380 --> 00:35:12,100
not make sense and like the really fun part that is like you can't ever show

549
00:35:12,100 --> 00:35:16,580
like they can't ever eat anything with meat and the show you can't visibly see

550
00:35:16,580 --> 00:35:19,820
them eating because because they would be eating yeah come on yeah that's why

551
00:35:19,820 --> 00:35:23,980
they're always eating just the rice and stuff oh yeah and then the American

552
00:35:23,980 --> 00:35:28,700
localization they say call it donuts yeah jelly doughnuts or what is it like

553
00:35:28,700 --> 00:35:32,020
like hot dogs and stuff. - Rice balls, or jelly donuts.

554
00:35:32,020 --> 00:35:33,180
- Yeah, it's pretty funny.

555
00:35:33,180 --> 00:35:35,620
But yeah, I just, I love that they had to put that

556
00:35:35,620 --> 00:35:36,460
in the thing, it's like the design document.

557
00:35:36,460 --> 00:35:37,980
- Yeah, 'cause you can't eat a Pokemon.

558
00:35:37,980 --> 00:35:39,820
- Yeah, you cannot.

559
00:35:39,820 --> 00:35:42,540
'Cause imagine one guy slips up and has,

560
00:35:42,540 --> 00:35:44,900
they eat a hamburger one time,

561
00:35:44,900 --> 00:35:46,420
and it's like, yeah, one kid sees it,

562
00:35:46,420 --> 00:35:48,180
and is like, oh my God.

563
00:35:48,180 --> 00:35:51,540
Like one kid who's smart enough to realize what that means.

564
00:35:51,540 --> 00:35:52,940
- Yeah, or they're eating something

565
00:35:52,940 --> 00:35:54,020
that looks like fried chicken,

566
00:35:54,020 --> 00:35:57,300
but it's clearly like, you see Pikachu's tail,

567
00:35:57,300 --> 00:36:02,540
lightning thing yeah I guess it's good that they said didn't show that you

568
00:36:02,540 --> 00:36:08,560
could eat a Pokemon you should I want to know exactly what I mean honestly I would

569
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:13,520
love to eat a match oak making them fight each other getting them to thin

570
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:18,400
fight and lean knock at each other out is is way worse than eating them I

571
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:23,180
absolutely yeah it's like what you can't battle dogs in the real world yeah but

572
00:36:23,180 --> 00:36:27,060
you can eat them yeah you're making they're making the Pokemon fight so that

573
00:36:27,060 --> 00:36:30,100
you can be the king of a building that has a pool in it.

574
00:36:30,100 --> 00:36:32,280
- Yeah, wait, okay, so it's a freaking,

575
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:33,900
and they have balls.

576
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:35,380
- Yeah. - Balls, what the hell?

577
00:36:35,380 --> 00:36:38,300
- Is a Pokeball on the Nintendo Switch today?

578
00:36:38,300 --> 00:36:40,380
- And you wake up, and your mom wakes you up.

579
00:36:40,380 --> 00:36:42,380
You're 10 years old and you go on an adventure.

580
00:36:42,380 --> 00:36:43,460
Isn't that a little young?

581
00:36:43,460 --> 00:36:44,300
- Makes no sense.

582
00:36:44,300 --> 00:36:45,120
- Wait, and you can only--

583
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:46,140
- Isn't Professor Oak a little bit weird

584
00:36:46,140 --> 00:36:47,700
for hanging out with a child?

585
00:36:47,700 --> 00:36:49,300
- Yep. (laughing)

586
00:36:49,300 --> 00:36:50,540
- Isn't he a little bit weird for hanging out with a child?

587
00:36:50,540 --> 00:36:52,460
- Wait, and you only get one starter Pokemon?

588
00:36:52,460 --> 00:36:53,780
Why can't you get all three?

589
00:36:53,780 --> 00:36:55,980
- And hold on, this makes no sense.

590
00:36:55,980 --> 00:36:58,700
He's making you take pictures of Pokemon in a little car.

591
00:36:58,700 --> 00:37:00,460
Isn't that kind of dangerous for the dogs and stuff?

592
00:37:00,460 --> 00:37:02,580
- And why can't you just get every Pokemon instantly

593
00:37:02,580 --> 00:37:03,500
at the start of the game?

594
00:37:03,500 --> 00:37:04,340
- It's actually true.

595
00:37:04,340 --> 00:37:05,300
- It doesn't make any sense.

596
00:37:05,300 --> 00:37:07,980
- How come I have to complete the Pokedex?

597
00:37:07,980 --> 00:37:08,820
- What the hell did you just say?

598
00:37:08,820 --> 00:37:10,020
- I have to look at Pokemon's dicks?

599
00:37:10,020 --> 00:37:10,860
- No, that's not at all.

600
00:37:10,860 --> 00:37:11,680
- Bruh, come on.

601
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:12,520
- Bruh.

602
00:37:12,520 --> 00:37:13,360
- No, bruh.

603
00:37:13,360 --> 00:37:14,180
- No, bruh.

604
00:37:14,180 --> 00:37:15,020
- Come on, bruh.

605
00:37:15,020 --> 00:37:16,020
- No, that can't be right.

606
00:37:16,020 --> 00:37:18,620
- I thought the Pokedex was so cool when I was a kid.

607
00:37:18,620 --> 00:37:19,460
- It is cool.

608
00:37:19,460 --> 00:37:20,280
- That was one of the coolest things ever to me.

609
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:23,640
and that looks like that now I'd literally I would I would have like I

610
00:37:23,640 --> 00:37:26,300
would have killed one of my parents to make my other parent by me a real life

611
00:37:26,300 --> 00:37:29,720
Pokedex if there was one maybe there was one, but just like one where I can like

612
00:37:29,720 --> 00:37:33,820
like in the in the show they like scan the Pokemon yeah, and it goes like yeah,

613
00:37:33,820 --> 00:37:37,480
like the crab Pokemon and then like says that like if I had something like that

614
00:37:37,480 --> 00:37:41,140
as a kid well, it would make that I was one that worked completely the same

615
00:37:41,140 --> 00:37:44,440
perfectly, but because there's no Pokemon in the world you would just been

616
00:37:44,440 --> 00:37:48,320
fucked yeah. Well, you first of all okay to branching pads here either they make

617
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:49,160
it for animals.

618
00:37:49,160 --> 00:37:53,600
or they may do that with this you can do that on Google now you can like really

619
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:57,400
yeah and the Google voice well you can do that with plants and shit doesn't

620
00:37:57,400 --> 00:38:03,760
important part lion enclosure huh I'm gonna drop myself in with the lions and

621
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:08,160
the bamboos and I'm gonna scan them with my Google app yeah and then they shreds

622
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:12,280
the second before the the lion eats you it's like could not recognize yeah you

623
00:38:12,280 --> 00:38:26,500
die lion the human eater the human eater animal lion type its weakness is being

624
00:38:26,500 --> 00:38:29,320
dropped off a building

625
00:38:37,120 --> 00:38:43,120
What's the one animal that you would not want to be put into an animal enclosure

626
00:38:43,120 --> 00:38:50,080
with? Squidward. Yeah, Squidward is this big. He'd be so rude to me. He is really small, I guess.

627
00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:56,720
Yeah, he's really small. Yeah, okay. But he's got that plot armor. Oh, true. No, but I mean--

628
00:38:56,720 --> 00:38:59,600
And I'd probably kill myself after being with him for five minutes. I think

629
00:38:59,600 --> 00:39:04,000
alligators is-- they're not gonna attack you, honestly. I don't think alligators--

630
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:05,800
All you have to do is climb.

631
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:08,680
- Well, also, alligators in enclosures,

632
00:39:08,680 --> 00:39:10,960
alligators only need to eat once a week,

633
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:12,640
and they're all pretty well-fed.

634
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:14,640
That's why they don't attack people who--

635
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:16,880
- Well, hungry alligator is the scenario.

636
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:17,720
- There's not-- - They're saying--

637
00:39:17,720 --> 00:39:18,800
(laughing)

638
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:19,640
- That's the part of the scenario.

639
00:39:19,640 --> 00:39:22,400
- You could assume the placard says--

640
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:25,360
- The hungriest alligator. - Hungry alligator.

641
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:27,080
American hungry alligator.

642
00:39:27,080 --> 00:39:29,120
- Also, yeah, if an alligator bucks at you,

643
00:39:29,120 --> 00:39:30,560
you can kind of, there's stuff,

644
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:31,880
if you hit it on the nose and stuff,

645
00:39:31,880 --> 00:39:33,720
or that's a shark, there's something you can do where--

646
00:39:33,720 --> 00:39:36,920
anything if you hear no it's like if you stand behind it and hold its mouth shut

647
00:39:36,920 --> 00:39:41,240
that's what you do it's all pretty easy. I think alligators are just not that big

648
00:39:41,240 --> 00:39:44,440
of a deal yeah they don't kill that I've been watching a bunch of alligator

649
00:39:44,440 --> 00:39:49,640
movies they're the belly and lions I think you're not so good to be around

650
00:39:49,640 --> 00:39:55,480
yeah I think a tiger would or lion any of any big cat that's not good and then I

651
00:39:55,480 --> 00:40:00,520
think maybe oh you know what a grizzly bear yeah grizzly bear like an enclosure

652
00:40:00,520 --> 00:40:04,320
with a grizzly bear you're fucked. You think so? Yeah, completely. You have no

653
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:08,520
chance because they're so big you can't climb away. I don't think it's gonna try, I don't

654
00:40:08,520 --> 00:40:11,480
think it'll. Yes it will, they're aggressive. They are aggressive. That's the thing about

655
00:40:11,480 --> 00:40:16,520
grizzly bears. Grizzly man? Literally the thing with grizzly bears is that they. No,

656
00:40:16,520 --> 00:40:21,240
you're absolutely fucked. A grizzly bear is a brown bear? Yeah. It's an American brown

657
00:40:21,240 --> 00:40:26,360
bear. I think I could soothe it. No. You could sue it? Have you ever seen the video of the

658
00:40:26,360 --> 00:40:30,400
brown bear that walks up next to the guy always fishing that was fine. That was a

659
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:35,040
I think that's probably a Kodiak bear was it I don't know it was brown. I think I

660
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:38,160
know the video you're talking about the thing about girls. I guess the thing

661
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:41,120
about a grizzly bear is a grizzly bear. I think is the one that will chase you if

662
00:40:41,120 --> 00:40:44,880
you run if you freak out at all like if you if you have any sense yeah like

663
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:50,280
like seen that that video that bear that gets stuck in the window no no trying to

664
00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:53,720
get honey and his friends have to push him out. Oh my god that shit's scary as

665
00:40:53,720 --> 00:40:57,600
fuck yeah and it's trying to get yeah it has and the scariest part of that bear

666
00:40:57,600 --> 00:41:01,760
is on the back of it it is like another face yeah have you seen this it is like

667
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:08,680
fucking horns on the back I can't believe how much you just got me I can't even

668
00:41:08,680 --> 00:41:19,640
believe it I was like no I haven't I can't believe how bad I just got owned

669
00:41:19,640 --> 00:41:25,460
ground yeah. No, I think grizzly bear you're fucked yeah. I think that's it's

670
00:41:25,460 --> 00:41:30,460
called a grizzly bear. Yeah, you know there's a scientific name is murderous

671
00:41:30,460 --> 00:41:36,900
man literally is it's ersus arctos horribilis. That's sick. Yeah, it's so

672
00:41:36,900 --> 00:41:43,400
cool. Yeah, the fucking like what because which came first grizzly bear or

673
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:48,140
grizzly murder because grizzly murder is spelled with an s. Yeah, it's different

674
00:41:48,140 --> 00:41:54,180
words. Really? Yeah. I didn't know that. Yeah. Gris, so it's grisly? Grisly murder.

675
00:41:54,180 --> 00:42:00,060
Grisly, yeah. So which game, like, I feel like Grisly Bear. Is that, is Grisly Bear

676
00:42:00,060 --> 00:42:05,700
a scientific name? Like, is that like it's... That's, no, it's, so it's like, well, you

677
00:42:05,700 --> 00:42:09,180
know, it's scientific name is Ursus Arctos Horribilis. You know what I mean? Like...

678
00:42:09,180 --> 00:42:14,140
Yeah, but I think that... A subspecies or whatever? It's called an American Brown Bear,

679
00:42:14,140 --> 00:42:17,020
also I think it's one of those things where neither of them like there's not

680
00:42:17,020 --> 00:42:22,580
like enough necessarily an official name like you would know either way yeah I

681
00:42:22,580 --> 00:42:26,100
don't think there's such thing as like an official name and that's like really

682
00:42:26,100 --> 00:42:29,580
mean well so do you want to know a fun fact about bears yeah why they're called

683
00:42:29,580 --> 00:42:33,540
bears is it called a grizzly bear because of that or is it like a like

684
00:42:33,540 --> 00:42:37,540
oh there's like a little grizzled grizzled is like also like like they're

685
00:42:37,540 --> 00:42:42,220
like I think is like a type of color texture type thing like I think that's

686
00:42:42,220 --> 00:42:48,100
that's where it's okay, but so bear is originally bears were called there's

687
00:42:48,100 --> 00:42:51,000
some words for bears and like like old like like

688
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:56,940
european or like maybe it was russian like like oh they had this word for bear,

689
00:42:56,940 --> 00:43:00,380
but they never they would never call bear. It was arctos that's what it was

690
00:43:00,380 --> 00:43:03,300
they would never call bear arctos because they believed that bears were

691
00:43:03,300 --> 00:43:06,860
like demons, and if you said the word arctos, it would summon a bear to come

692
00:43:06,860 --> 00:43:10,940
kill you. So they would they'd instead they called them like like brown haired

693
00:43:10,980 --> 00:43:13,860
animals or like they would use like euphemisms to describe them and that's

694
00:43:13,860 --> 00:43:17,400
where bear comes from is like brown or something whoa or they would call them

695
00:43:17,400 --> 00:43:20,780
like honey eaters and stuff, but they were too afraid to say the word the word

696
00:43:20,780 --> 00:43:24,500
for bear whoa yeah bears were out there fucking people up for quite yeah

697
00:43:24,500 --> 00:43:29,900
they're they're crazy. That's sick before that we got houses and cars yeah

698
00:43:29,900 --> 00:43:35,920
pre houses and cars. They were just fucking destroyers were just doing

699
00:43:35,940 --> 00:43:37,740
crazy. I was reading this thing about

700
00:43:37,740 --> 00:43:42,500
about bear attacks throughout history. I was going through the wikipedia page

701
00:43:42,500 --> 00:43:46,560
yeah and it's like it goes from like the seventeen hundreds or whatever to

702
00:43:46,560 --> 00:43:49,820
like just to the present day. It's funny because all the first ones are

703
00:43:49,820 --> 00:43:54,000
like a man, a man put on his hunting had and today, like from the excerpt

704
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:58,200
from a newspaper, like a man put on his hunting hat today and and stated I'm

705
00:43:58,200 --> 00:44:00,640
going out to kill a bear and he never returned

706
00:44:00,640 --> 00:44:04,800
like the nineteen hundreds. They're like twenty in a row that are just

707
00:44:04,840 --> 00:44:09,160
like a man was hitting a bear with a stick through the bars that a zoo and he

708
00:44:09,160 --> 00:44:10,520
got pulled in and ripped apart.

709
00:44:10,520 --> 00:44:16,760
Yeah, that's a bad. I think there's a bad way to go. I think any any lot of

710
00:44:16,760 --> 00:44:22,680
just animal just tear you to bits alive. Yeah, probably got to be in my top two

711
00:44:22,680 --> 00:44:26,520
worst ways of die there, so it's so far. So the original question is like which

712
00:44:26,520 --> 00:44:30,720
animal would you would you least want to be in an enclosure with? I guess there's

713
00:44:30,760 --> 00:44:35,400
lot yeah what's the most probably a mosquito you know that's the deadliest

714
00:44:35,400 --> 00:44:42,680
animal I carry West Nile true and truly yeah Hitler yeah yeah I got Jack the

715
00:44:42,680 --> 00:44:46,680
Ripper I jacked the rip do you guys think I feel like I'm not a I'm not a lady of

716
00:44:46,680 --> 00:44:50,640
the night I would probably like a hundred and ten pounds yeah you know

717
00:44:50,640 --> 00:44:55,520
yeah like he's probably such a pussy dude yeah well yeah he was a pussy

718
00:44:55,520 --> 00:44:58,000
because of all that stuff he did to those women that's right that's right the

719
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:01,500
a coward. Yeah, you're a loser. Pick on someone your own size. Jack the Ripper?

720
00:45:01,500 --> 00:45:07,120
You're a frigging bitch. Yeah, this is... That's it. You're done, Jack the Ripper.

721
00:45:07,120 --> 00:45:10,240
You're done, man. You're not doing that shit anymore. So did he really... We're

722
00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:13,240
putting an end to it. Did he really rip these women up? He did.

723
00:45:13,240 --> 00:45:17,620
They get some crazy old serial...

724
00:45:17,620 --> 00:45:22,240
There's the old joke, like, "Oh, stop giving them such cool names."

725
00:45:23,520 --> 00:45:26,520
I feel like we've effectively done,

726
00:45:26,520 --> 00:45:30,800
there hasn't been a cool serial killer name in a while.

727
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:32,600
- That's 'cause we don't have serial killers anymore,

728
00:45:32,600 --> 00:45:34,900
we have mass shooters and now we just,

729
00:45:34,900 --> 00:45:37,380
they just have their names.

730
00:45:37,380 --> 00:45:38,900
- Most of their names are very stupid.

731
00:45:38,900 --> 00:45:43,480
- True crime has just destroyed the brains of people.

732
00:45:43,480 --> 00:45:45,140
- Zodiac is so cool.

733
00:45:45,140 --> 00:45:45,980
- Zodiac Killer?

734
00:45:45,980 --> 00:45:46,820
- Such a cool--

735
00:45:46,820 --> 00:45:51,020
- Zodiac and Mr. Cruel was like some Australian.

736
00:45:51,020 --> 00:45:52,980
Actually, he wasn't a killer, I don't think.

737
00:45:52,980 --> 00:45:53,980
He was a serial rapist.

738
00:45:53,980 --> 00:45:54,980
Yeah, BTK.

739
00:45:54,980 --> 00:45:55,980
It's all just so cool.

740
00:45:55,980 --> 00:45:56,980
Yeah.

741
00:45:56,980 --> 00:45:57,980
Yeah.

742
00:45:57,980 --> 00:46:02,860
But like, True Crime's just, it's eroded our brains into fucking shit.

743
00:46:02,860 --> 00:46:03,860
You think so?

744
00:46:03,860 --> 00:46:04,860
Yeah.

745
00:46:04,860 --> 00:46:05,860
Our brains?

746
00:46:05,860 --> 00:46:06,860
I don't think so.

747
00:46:06,860 --> 00:46:07,860
People's brains, the collective conscious.

748
00:46:07,860 --> 00:46:09,420
I'm not so much into True Crime.

749
00:46:09,420 --> 00:46:10,420
I hate it.

750
00:46:10,420 --> 00:46:12,700
I really liked the first season of Serial.

751
00:46:12,700 --> 00:46:13,700
I think.

752
00:46:13,700 --> 00:46:17,780
Because I thought, I really, I was hoping that the girl and the kid in jail were going to

753
00:46:17,780 --> 00:46:19,140
fuck at the end, but they didn't.

754
00:46:19,140 --> 00:46:22,340
I think the problem with True Crime is that it all has really boring endings.

755
00:46:22,340 --> 00:46:26,020
because it's all real. You either go to jail. They should make up endings for it.

756
00:46:26,020 --> 00:46:30,300
Yeah, the ending should be scary. You think the guy's dead and then he's

757
00:46:30,300 --> 00:46:33,500
actually alive. Exactly, the ending to every true crime thing is either, "but we have

758
00:46:33,500 --> 00:46:36,660
no idea and there's no way to solve this" or it's like, "and then they got him and

759
00:46:36,660 --> 00:46:39,740
they put him in jail and that's that." Yeah, there's always, it's there's never

760
00:46:39,740 --> 00:46:43,380
like a, like they always try to tell it like it's like a movie story.

761
00:46:43,380 --> 00:46:47,620
In the end, there's just like, "was Robert Durst having a heart attack and then like you..."

762
00:46:47,620 --> 00:46:53,700
and then a lightning strikes him. Yeah exactly. Or you see his body under a sheet at the morgue.

763
00:46:53,700 --> 00:47:02,740
And the sheet's gone. Yeah exactly. There's this woman who like, because her mom got killed by her

764
00:47:02,740 --> 00:47:09,140
mom's friend who took out a life insurance policy on her or some shit. Her friend? Yeah. I don't

765
00:47:09,140 --> 00:47:12,820
know. I don't remember the exact details of the story. When someone kills somebody and one week

766
00:47:12,820 --> 00:47:16,820
earlier they were at a life insurance office like, "I'd like to take out a life insurance policy on

767
00:47:16,820 --> 00:47:21,420
my friend yeah but there is like some detail out there's some details I forget

768
00:47:21,420 --> 00:47:27,180
but like because there was a Dateline episode that story of her mom's murder

769
00:47:27,180 --> 00:47:32,060
is like being optioned off into a show it's like Jesus fucking Christ like

770
00:47:32,060 --> 00:47:36,820
there's a real person like how the foot like this fucking stupid like she should

771
00:47:36,820 --> 00:47:40,500
always get some money for that she yeah like you should get like a shit ton of

772
00:47:40,500 --> 00:47:47,740
of money yeah yeah money money will bring the mommy back yeah money brings mommy

773
00:47:47,740 --> 00:47:52,140
back money brings mommy back mm-hmm yeah yeah yeah I don't know I don't think it

774
00:47:52,140 --> 00:47:56,380
matters that much I mean I think if you had your entire family killed I mean I

775
00:47:56,380 --> 00:48:00,180
would I would be really mad I wouldn't like it I don't think it's like my like

776
00:48:00,180 --> 00:48:05,100
here's the caveat you should be able to pick who plays you yeah yeah cuz you're

777
00:48:05,100 --> 00:48:08,900
gonna be in the show exactly and you should either be able to play yourself or

778
00:48:08,900 --> 00:48:12,540
or you should be able to pick just whoever you want yeah you get the choice

779
00:48:12,540 --> 00:48:19,540
if I if I if I lose my parents to a murderer mm-hmm and then they are like

a cleft lip or something.

789
00:49:00,740 --> 00:49:03,240
- Yeah, no, like, bald is not on the same level as cleft lip.

790
00:49:03,240 --> 00:49:05,040
- No, what are you talking about?

791
00:49:05,040 --> 00:49:05,880
- Like, the reenactor--

792
00:49:05,880 --> 00:49:08,540
- They make my dad bald, he has one arm.

793
00:49:08,540 --> 00:49:11,620
- In the reenactment, they make my dad a bald guy

794
00:49:11,620 --> 00:49:14,220
with a cleft lip, it's like, you're not honoring my dad.

795
00:49:14,220 --> 00:49:17,780
- They make my dad Immortan Joe from Mad Max Fury Road.

796
00:49:17,780 --> 00:49:19,460
They give him like a gas mask.

797
00:49:19,460 --> 00:49:21,580
- Yeah, they make my dad, like, if they did that shit,

798
00:49:21,580 --> 00:49:24,740
if my, like, if the reenactors of my life

799
00:49:24,740 --> 00:49:28,020
were fucking weird looking, I'd be so mad.

800
00:49:28,020 --> 00:49:35,500
Yeah, it's like I already lost my mom and now you're making her like 600 pounds. Yeah, that's fucked up. You're adding insult

801
00:49:35,500 --> 00:49:37,500
Yeah, they make my dad an alien

802
00:49:37,500 --> 00:49:43,820
And he's totally from another world. Here's Brosnan and Pamela Anderson to be my mom and dad and you're if they get murdered

803
00:49:43,820 --> 00:49:49,620
Yeah, yeah, the person who it's about should have some power over it, I guess but I don't think yeah, I don't I don't know

804
00:49:49,620 --> 00:49:51,900
Whatever Idris Elba plays my dad

805
00:49:53,100 --> 00:49:57,140
Please me. Did you sell what plays my dad? I play myself. Mm-hmm

806
00:49:57,140 --> 00:50:01,620
Favorite son Caleb. Yeah, thank you dad

807
00:50:01,620 --> 00:50:10,740
Thank you dad my favorite son. I've always thought murdered now. No, don't go get murdered. I've always loved how similar we are

808
00:50:10,740 --> 00:50:14,260
People immediately know that I'm your show

809
00:50:14,260 --> 00:50:21,820
You're amazing on a soccer field, I'm a footy player ball field. I'm a footy player. I really am

810
00:50:22,380 --> 00:50:29,460
You're so amazing. I wish you were alive to solve your own blokes on your thank you. I really appreciate that age or a dad

811
00:50:29,460 --> 00:50:32,340
That's so sweet of you

812
00:50:32,340 --> 00:50:35,060
and my mom

813
00:50:35,060 --> 00:50:37,300
my mom is

814
00:50:37,300 --> 00:50:41,700
Kate Kate yeah, and then the the murderer Darth Vader

815
00:50:41,700 --> 00:50:45,620
Okay, my mom is Kate Upton and a plot point is that I breastfed until I was

816
00:50:48,900 --> 00:50:52,500
having like a like like you know what okay we are saying all these like true

817
00:50:52,500 --> 00:50:55,740
crime stories and like like starting a true crime show and being like like

818
00:50:55,740 --> 00:50:58,740
figuring out all the stories you're gonna do and just like every episode and

819
00:50:58,740 --> 00:51:03,300
just being like now there aren't that many hints but I think we're being that

820
00:51:03,300 --> 00:51:09,060
I think based on the clues here we can conclude that Darth Vader was the killer

821
00:51:09,060 --> 00:51:16,180
who's more evil than possibly have it in them to do something so evil giving

822
00:51:16,180 --> 00:51:19,600
like interviews with all the family were like dredging up this horrible stuff.

823
00:51:19,600 --> 00:51:23,840
Everyone's crying and then they're like so did you ever see Darth Vader around

824
00:51:23,840 --> 00:51:27,600
the house at any point during your childhood? I mean I've seen him a few

825
00:51:27,600 --> 00:51:32,040
times. Not really. I mean I guess I guess I guess on the TV. Yeah, I saw I

826
00:51:32,040 --> 00:51:36,260
saw Darth Vader. So after yes, so the family admits what is there a big bug?

827
00:51:36,260 --> 00:51:39,900
Oh, it's just a spider. It's a big spider going down to you. That is a

828
00:51:39,900 --> 00:51:43,540
crazy coming down to me. Shut up. You screamed last time. I was hoping you

829
00:51:43,540 --> 00:51:48,420
it again. We were in the middle of doing an amazing riff slash bit. I'm sorry.

830
00:51:48,420 --> 00:51:52,220
Darth Vader being the killer. Okay let's get back into the riff. I don't even have

831
00:51:52,220 --> 00:51:55,540
an enemy anymore. You don't have the riff anymore dude. Okay here's a new bit.

832
00:51:55,540 --> 00:51:59,380
Caleb would if he sees a spider. Okay that one's pretty good. Do you want to riff on

833
00:51:59,380 --> 00:52:03,580
that Pat? Here's a sound Caleb would make if he saw like the if he was in stuck in

834
00:52:03,580 --> 00:52:09,940
a spider enclosure. Yeah a spider enclosure would give fuck. Okay wait here's the sound that Caleb would make if he

835
00:52:09,940 --> 00:52:18,540
was if he saw Darth Vader I would say his name Darth Vader I mean I would get

836
00:52:18,540 --> 00:52:22,300
pretty excited so I get a photo of them that's probably one that you don't want

837
00:52:22,300 --> 00:52:35,540
to see you see you into he's a scariest battle at the end of Kenobi no looks

838
00:52:35,540 --> 00:52:42,340
like shit. Oh my god. But before I've had that battle at the end of my cannoli, all that cheese,

839
00:52:42,340 --> 00:52:48,020
oh my god. Oh, the raccote. That battle in my body. It's so cool that people- My body battle.

840
00:52:48,020 --> 00:52:53,540
Jersey Italians just make up that word, make up words. Raccote. Raccote. That's what my grandpa

841
00:52:53,540 --> 00:52:59,700
does, he does that. Yeah. Yeah. Fucking piece of shit. Mm. Madone. He doesn't say madone. Oof,

842
00:52:59,700 --> 00:53:05,380
madone. My girlfriend says that. That's just from the Sopranos. That's not it, no. She's never seen

843
00:53:05,380 --> 00:53:08,760
it. She's never seen The Sopranos? Yeah. Unless she picked it up from somebody who

844
00:53:08,760 --> 00:53:13,540
had seen it then. Probably. Yeah, it's only in Sopranos. It only exists in New Jersey. If you're from like

845
00:53:13,540 --> 00:53:18,620
Bergen County or just you're in Sopranos all the time. Pretty much. Yeah. Yeah. It

846
00:53:18,620 --> 00:53:24,540
is so cool that the that the... Did you guys see the thing where the the fucking

847
00:53:24,540 --> 00:53:28,980
what's-his-name Tony Soprano, the actor, what is his name? Oh yeah. James Gannolfini.

848
00:53:28,980 --> 00:53:34,180
He got a call in the middle of the night from some like unknown number and it was

849
00:53:34,180 --> 00:53:37,860
just somebody they were like listen we really like what you're doing we think

850
00:53:37,860 --> 00:53:43,980
you're doing a very good job but a Don would never wear shorts and then he hung

851
00:53:43,980 --> 00:53:49,220
up that's crazy just called us a like no guy who's in the mafia would never be

852
00:53:49,220 --> 00:53:56,480
caught dead where that's sick what a beast yeah I something I love about the

853
00:53:56,480 --> 00:54:01,020
Sopranos that I think that needs to be more chose still is a leftism the left

854
00:54:01,020 --> 00:54:07,580
leftism is huge. But I love how many how many jokes are just of a fat guy who's

855
00:54:07,580 --> 00:54:18,060
like I'm gonna go eat some food. It's funny. It's not a no Bobby. No Bobby

856
00:54:18,060 --> 00:54:24,580
Bacala Bobby Bacala. He's the best. What's the fucking this every time. Oh

857
00:54:24,580 --> 00:54:28,820
Don Vito. Yeah. Don't say any spoilers though because I haven't finished the

858
00:54:28,820 --> 00:54:35,060
Oh, yeah, oh, I know he's gay though. I found that out. Okay, I just watch that episode season 5

859
00:54:35,060 --> 00:54:41,780
Second to last right there's like season 6 a and 6 beers. Oh, yeah, damn

860
00:54:41,780 --> 00:54:48,180
New Hampshire makes an appearance for real. I will holy crap. Okay, I need a

861
00:54:48,180 --> 00:54:54,420
TV show like that goes to New Hampshire not breaking bad. What the fuck are you talking about?

862
00:54:54,420 --> 00:54:58,540
about I got to hold the license plate from Breaking Bad because in my in my

863
00:54:58,540 --> 00:55:01,820
wait when did you know he goes to New Hampshire at the end of season or the

864
00:55:01,820 --> 00:55:04,740
beginning of season 5 he's in New Hampshire oh I thought he's in fucking

865
00:55:04,740 --> 00:55:09,180
Alaska no that's New Hampshire he's gonna be in are they say it's Alaska

866
00:55:09,180 --> 00:55:14,260
though it may be oh no it's in you he has New Hampshire plates on his car I

867
00:55:14,260 --> 00:55:20,380
guess Alaska they live in the show they say he's going to Alaska I'm like 90

868
00:55:20,380 --> 00:55:23,900
he must have gotten New Hampshire plates and gone to Alaska it doesn't look like

869
00:55:23,900 --> 00:55:28,500
like New Hampshire always. Yeah, it's Alaska. The first episode is called Live Free or Die.

870
00:55:28,500 --> 00:55:34,420
Oh, you're right. Let me look it up. I also, I, that's crazy. I think I honestly just assumed

871
00:55:34,420 --> 00:55:38,260
that it was Alaska. Because it was snowy and in a TV show that it was supposed to be Alaska.

872
00:55:38,260 --> 00:55:42,620
I could have sworn he said something about Alaska. I'm like clearly I am right about

873
00:55:42,620 --> 00:55:47,780
something but the both, there's a, the mob mentality of you two. Two versus one is always

874
00:55:47,780 --> 00:55:52,420
right. Oh, it always wins. Dude, it is New Hampshire, what the fuck? You're such a genius.

875
00:55:52,420 --> 00:55:55,100
- Dude, that was a huge thing.

876
00:55:55,100 --> 00:55:55,940
- Was it huge for y'all?

877
00:55:55,940 --> 00:55:58,220
- That was huge and everyone was like, "Holy shit."

878
00:55:58,220 --> 00:56:00,660
And then, yeah, I got to some guy

879
00:56:00,660 --> 00:56:02,660
who came to my class and held a license plate up.

880
00:56:02,660 --> 00:56:05,500
- Fucking Jesse wants to go to Alaska.

881
00:56:05,500 --> 00:56:06,340
- Oh, yeah.

882
00:56:06,340 --> 00:56:08,020
- That's what I'm thinking of.

883
00:56:08,020 --> 00:56:10,900
- You know, that's very cool about New Hampshire,

884
00:56:10,900 --> 00:56:13,820
but they actually filmed "Under the Dome" in Wilmington.

885
00:56:13,820 --> 00:56:14,700
- Was "Under the Dome."

886
00:56:14,700 --> 00:56:17,460
- Okay, so somebody fucking hates prestige television.

887
00:56:17,460 --> 00:56:18,580
"Under the Dome."

888
00:56:18,580 --> 00:56:20,460
- They go "Under a Dome."

889
00:56:20,460 --> 00:56:25,180
every show that somebody like like like Breaking Bad and like Sopranos maybe

890
00:56:25,180 --> 00:56:29,280
it's just Breaking Bad and Sopranos do they go to I've never seen Mad Men do

891
00:56:29,280 --> 00:56:33,180
they go to New Hampshire and Mad Men I don't think so I mean if we're talking

892
00:56:33,180 --> 00:56:40,900
the wires TV Holly Flax moves to Nashua what the fuck is that it's Holly Flax

893
00:56:40,900 --> 00:56:45,620
you can imagine the face I'm making at the camera right now I don't know what

894
00:56:45,620 --> 00:56:50,060
what it is. He's at the office. Yeah. Oh, I'm doing a gym face at him not

895
00:56:50,060 --> 00:56:53,520
knowing who Holly Flax is Holly Flax. Which one is that? Which one is

896
00:56:53,520 --> 00:56:57,820
Holly Sweetheart? Michael's sweet my way. Michael has a sweetheart. Oh,

897
00:56:57,820 --> 00:57:01,280
when they yeah, when I see screenshots of that stupid ass character in that

898
00:57:01,280 --> 00:57:06,480
show, I'm like I pray that this this white guy never breeds true and he has

899
00:57:06,480 --> 00:57:10,120
a fucking sweetheart. Thank God. She moves away. She moves away, but then

900
00:57:10,120 --> 00:57:13,360
he moves to Nashua. Does he get her eggs before she moves? He goes and he

901
00:57:13,380 --> 00:57:14,380
has six kids with her.

902
00:57:14,380 --> 00:57:19,020
That is fucking disgusting.

903
00:57:19,020 --> 00:57:21,340
They go to Nashville, but they did not film in Nashville.

904
00:57:21,340 --> 00:57:22,340
I know.

905
00:57:22,340 --> 00:57:23,340
I see some of the quotes.

906
00:57:23,340 --> 00:57:24,900
I'll tell you what, I like the Stanley and Pam.

907
00:57:24,900 --> 00:57:29,980
Some of the quotes from that fucking idiot moronic lunatic, I wish I could shake him

908
00:57:29,980 --> 00:57:34,180
by the shoulders and say, "Sir, never reproduce."

909
00:57:34,180 --> 00:57:35,180
We need a new plague.

910
00:57:35,180 --> 00:57:36,500
Remove yourself from the gene pool.

911
00:57:36,500 --> 00:57:39,340
Oh my God, Darwin award, please.

912
00:57:39,340 --> 00:57:41,940
Please give yourself a Darwin award, my friend.

913
00:57:41,940 --> 00:57:43,820
I shouldn't even call you my friend.

914
00:57:43,820 --> 00:57:45,220
My moronic friend.

915
00:57:45,220 --> 00:57:47,140
He's a fucking idiot.

916
00:57:47,140 --> 00:57:50,900
You waste of crapping space.

917
00:57:50,900 --> 00:57:53,220
You friggin' idiot, Michael Scott.

918
00:57:53,220 --> 00:57:56,700
You don't even have 30 IQ points to rub together.

919
00:57:56,700 --> 00:58:00,940
You are basically like a shit on a stick with a pooper brain.

920
00:58:00,940 --> 00:58:01,940
Michael Scott, I hope you get AIDS.

921
00:58:01,940 --> 00:58:02,940
How did you get to be boss?

922
00:58:02,940 --> 00:58:05,060
How did you get to be boss?

923
00:58:05,060 --> 00:58:07,340
See, I think that's where the comedy lies.

924
00:58:07,340 --> 00:58:09,820
The boss should be everyone else.

925
00:58:09,820 --> 00:58:10,820
I agree.

926
00:58:10,820 --> 00:58:16,020
This guy has no business being a boss of a lunch, let alone a fucking entire company.

927
00:58:16,020 --> 00:58:17,020
Oh my God, don't even get me started.

928
00:58:17,020 --> 00:58:19,900
He'd be like, "Don't eat the sandwich."

929
00:58:19,900 --> 00:58:20,900
Yeah.

930
00:58:20,900 --> 00:58:23,820
Meanwhile, an effective boss, "Eat the sandwich at your own pace."

931
00:58:23,820 --> 00:58:24,820
Yep.

932
00:58:24,820 --> 00:58:25,820
Yep.

933
00:58:25,820 --> 00:58:28,540
Meanwhile, an effective boss.

934
00:58:28,540 --> 00:58:34,460
We should do the office with, but like fixing the office where we get, we replace...

935
00:58:34,460 --> 00:58:35,460
CinemaSins.

936
00:58:35,460 --> 00:58:36,460
CinemaSins.

937
00:58:36,460 --> 00:58:38,060
Michael is actually a really ineffective boss.

938
00:58:38,060 --> 00:58:38,900
(laughing)

939
00:58:38,900 --> 00:58:41,140
- He's inefficient and poor management technique.

940
00:58:41,140 --> 00:58:44,060
- His team building is pitiful.

941
00:58:44,060 --> 00:58:45,900
- Pris and Mike is actually quite offensive.

942
00:58:45,900 --> 00:58:47,700
(laughing)

943
00:58:47,700 --> 00:58:50,020
- No office would actually have a diversity day.

944
00:58:50,020 --> 00:58:51,500
- Yep.

945
00:58:51,500 --> 00:58:52,340
- Actually, they probably would these days.

946
00:58:52,340 --> 00:58:54,260
- I think they would have a diversity day.

947
00:58:54,260 --> 00:58:55,220
- Nowadays, probably.

948
00:58:55,220 --> 00:58:56,340
- Nowadays, they'd love--

949
00:58:56,340 --> 00:58:58,620
- Back when I was working at offices.

950
00:58:58,620 --> 00:59:00,460
- When I worked in an office,

951
00:59:00,460 --> 00:59:02,780
when I worked in an office, I was harassed every day.

952
00:59:02,780 --> 00:59:04,100
- For being the only-- - For real?

953
00:59:04,100 --> 00:59:05,720
- For wearing a skirt.

954
00:59:05,720 --> 00:59:06,560
- Me too.

955
00:59:06,560 --> 00:59:07,540
Well, not for wearing a skirt.

956
00:59:07,540 --> 00:59:10,140
I did it for wearing pants because I was in a liberal office.

957
00:59:10,140 --> 00:59:11,140
Oh yeah.

958
00:59:11,140 --> 00:59:12,140
And I was the only-

959
00:59:12,140 --> 00:59:13,140
Why aren't you wearing a dress?

960
00:59:13,140 --> 00:59:15,220
I was the only white cracker in the whole office.

961
00:59:15,220 --> 00:59:16,220
Yep.

962
00:59:16,220 --> 00:59:17,220
And I was completely male.

963
00:59:17,220 --> 00:59:18,220
Yeah.

964
00:59:18,220 --> 00:59:27,260
I was completely a male cracker and they hated me for that.

965
00:59:27,260 --> 00:59:29,220
And they hated me at my liberal office.

966
00:59:29,220 --> 00:59:30,220
Can you believe it?

967
00:59:30,220 --> 00:59:31,220
Oh my God, they hated you.

968
00:59:31,220 --> 00:59:32,220
And I was straight.

969
00:59:32,220 --> 00:59:33,220
Wow.

970
00:59:33,220 --> 00:59:34,220
Yeah.

971
00:59:34,220 --> 00:59:37,180
I mean nowadays at liberal offices they'll be like, "Oh, you're wearing pants?

972
00:59:37,180 --> 00:59:41,180
Why aren't you wearing a dress?" And I'll be like, "Buddy, the only address I care

973
00:59:41,180 --> 00:59:43,180
about is 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue."

974
00:59:43,180 --> 00:59:44,180
That's right.

975
00:59:44,180 --> 00:59:45,180
And then I do this.

976
00:59:45,180 --> 00:59:48,180
"Why aren't you wearing a dress? The only address I care about..."

977
00:59:48,180 --> 00:59:49,180
Holy shit.

978
00:59:49,180 --> 00:59:52,180
I'm about to shit myself. I'm about to shit myself.

979
00:59:52,180 --> 00:59:56,180
I thought that was the chair breaking.

980
00:59:56,180 --> 00:59:59,180
It was the chair and it was a little bit my stomach and I have to go. And I hope

981
00:59:59,180 --> 01:00:04,180
you guys have a great last 15 seconds of this episode. But I am going to leave.

982
01:00:04,180 --> 01:00:06,460
How long is it gonna take you to shit in there?

983
01:00:06,460 --> 01:00:12,820
Probably three minutes. Okay, or less. Okay, I'm just gonna be a shotgun blast. I'm gonna run

984
01:00:12,820 --> 01:00:17,500
Wait bring the mic in with you

985
01:00:17,500 --> 01:00:23,300
Just go in there the door and start pooping

986
01:00:23,300 --> 01:00:30,260
I'm not gonna do it. I'm afraid I don't think we should record him pooping. Oh

987
01:00:31,980 --> 01:00:35,500
He turned the sink on so we can't hear it. All right. It's what a fucking bitch
