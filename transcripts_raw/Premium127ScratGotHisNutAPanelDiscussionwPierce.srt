Scrappy his own nuts crack out his acorn slash nut thing. Mm-hmm. He ate it actually

10
00:00:44,020 --> 00:00:48,580
Yeah, he got he gets it every time. Yeah, never actually puts it in his mouth and choose

11
00:00:48,580 --> 00:00:54,280
He usually has your desk thinking that means something else. What did you yeah, I don't even want to say

12
00:00:55,940 --> 00:00:56,940
Nasty.

13
00:00:56,940 --> 00:00:58,540
Low, like he eats it out.

14
00:00:58,540 --> 00:00:59,540
No.

15
00:00:59,540 --> 00:01:03,180
Did you think I was like, what do you mean he eats it out?

16
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:04,540
He puts it up his butt?

17
00:01:04,540 --> 00:01:05,940
Oh, he got his butt.

18
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:06,940
That's what he was saying.

19
00:01:06,940 --> 00:01:10,940
Imagine how many, imagine how many nasty ass things he's got on his butt.

20
00:01:10,940 --> 00:01:12,940
He's grabbed his own butt.

21
00:01:12,940 --> 00:01:15,940
Wait, his acorn or you probably thought he's got a gape horn.

22
00:01:15,940 --> 00:01:16,940
Yep.

23
00:01:16,940 --> 00:01:17,940
He's probably way weirder.

24
00:01:17,940 --> 00:01:19,940
He's grabbed his butt in gape horn.

25
00:01:19,940 --> 00:01:20,940
No.

26
00:01:20,940 --> 00:01:21,940
I watched the video.

27
00:01:21,940 --> 00:01:22,940
Me too.

28
00:01:22,940 --> 00:01:23,940
A couple times.

29
00:01:23,940 --> 00:01:24,940
Everybody's watched the video.

30
00:01:24,940 --> 00:01:29,340
seen it but like why does he not eat the top of the nut you don't eat that yeah

31
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:32,860
that's like the plate if you're hungry that's like eating an oyster shell but if

32
00:01:32,860 --> 00:01:37,180
you're scrat you eat the oyster shell no scrat's like scrat doesn't eat oysters at

33
00:01:37,180 --> 00:01:44,900
all that's why he's mentally disabled he's a mentally could have mentally

34
00:01:44,900 --> 00:01:49,260
disabled squirrel rat marry another squirrel with the same name as him but

35
00:01:49,260 --> 00:01:53,700
with an e at the end gratte it's a really I don't think so could could have

36
00:01:53,700 --> 00:02:00,240
mentally challenged squirrel rat discover scratlantis he didn't really or

37
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:04,180
could he or could he or could he pilot a UFO and launch deadly meteors at the

38
00:02:04,180 --> 00:02:09,080
earth mm-hmm probably no yeah that's a good really you probably think he's

39
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:12,600
mentally a wife's his big eyes that twitch sometimes and his yes is weird

40
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:16,980
yeah we you're all yeah so we are also he can't I mean he's been look even

41
00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:21,180
trying to get a nut for like we said millions of years I'd feel like it's not

42
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:26,540
Yeah, he's not very good at falling through. Well. Yeah, I was I've been reading a bunch about scrat this morning

43
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:34,320
Did you know that he there's a big controversy apparently that this woman said that Fox stole the idea for scrat from her yeah

44
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:37,660
She had this idea first. Yeah, I grow with me. It was

45
00:02:37,660 --> 00:02:40,540
socialite at every party she would

46
00:02:40,540 --> 00:02:46,060
- of him she

47
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:50,140
character I made she claimed that she created scrat but he was called scrat

48
00:02:50,140 --> 00:02:54,580
because he was a squirrel rat and it was originally she spelled it sqr a t and

49
00:02:54,580 --> 00:03:00,360
then in when I had the idea for a squirrel at a rat first yeah I had the

50
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:04,860
idea for a sponge bob before they they made yeah yeah well I had spongebob I

51
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:09,580
didn't have the square pants thing yeah that's fair there was you were what you

52
00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:14,580
are gotta stop there is a sponge bob there is a sponge bob I made but it was

53
00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:19,860
it was just because he was in my sink. I'm not giving you anything. I'm giving you

54
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:25,300
nothing. I already said the square pits thing and you six year old ADHD in the

55
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:31,100
middle of it, so you're getting nothing. A guy sneezed really loud outside. And you

56
00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:34,540
stopped. Yeah, you whipped your head around like someone had a gun to your

57
00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:37,780
head. Do you put on a white noise machine at night and just like keep waking up?

58
00:03:37,780 --> 00:03:42,620
up every time there was another green and white. No, what is that? No,

59
00:03:42,620 --> 00:03:46,740
there's rain drops coming from my phone. What is that? There's already enough

60
00:03:46,740 --> 00:03:50,140
white noise in my apartment. Oh, that's right. That's right. That's right. You

61
00:03:50,140 --> 00:03:53,820
guys know that in the DVD commentary, they refer to scrat as the scrat.

62
00:03:53,820 --> 00:03:58,700
Really? Yeah. Yeah. That, does that, well, that's kinda, does that insinuate

63
00:03:58,700 --> 00:04:01,740
that he's the only scrat? Well, it's not though, 'cause there's tons of his

64
00:04:01,740 --> 00:04:05,180
species on scratlantis. I think that they had to change it from the scrat

65
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:10,220
after they made another scratch. It's probably yeah, probably it could be

66
00:04:10,220 --> 00:04:13,700
it like a Ukraine type thing. Hmm. Or maybe scrap was like you're not

67
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:17,100
supposed to say you're not supposed to say the scrat. You're not.

68
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:21,100
You're not supposed to call Ukraine the scrat. No, it's like calling him

69
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:25,000
the dog. Like his name isn't like his species is scrat. Yeah, is that

70
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,000
your will? Well, you would but then the girl was called scrat a yeah.

71
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,100
I mean later on they figured out that they couldn't name anything but

72
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:34,900
scrat. They don't need to be funny. Say give him a name. I've got a

73
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:36,020
Sid the sloth.

74
00:04:36,020 --> 00:04:40,740
Yeah, but no, but like Scrat and Scratay don't say, "I am Scrat, I'm Scratay."

75
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:42,180
No, they say, "Nyeh-nyeh-nyeh-nyeh."

76
00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:43,380
Yeah, so like I-

77
00:04:43,380 --> 00:04:45,220
Well, the Scratlantis Scrats speak.

78
00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:45,380
Yeah.

79
00:04:45,380 --> 00:04:47,220
So let me see. Can you pull that up?

80
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:47,860
Okay, yeah.

81
00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:49,620
The Scratlantis Scrats do speak.

82
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:52,020
I want to see if any of them say that their name is Scrat.

83
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:54,100
The Scratlantis Scrats are really gonna-

84
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:55,700
Well, they say, "Welcome to Scratlantis."

85
00:04:55,700 --> 00:04:57,140
They're gonna make the Super Bowl this year.

86
00:04:57,140 --> 00:04:59,540
So he must be a Scrat if they name him.

87
00:04:59,540 --> 00:05:01,940
So he is mentally challenged. He can't speak.

88
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:07,620
well there at the scrap lantis people are of higher intelligence and most scrap

89
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:12,420
and it's also i also scrap well i also think that that maybe uh...

90
00:05:12,420 --> 00:05:15,240
you know maybe most sometimes the most intelligent individuals don't need to

91
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:19,480
speak and i don't want to make a word he's post language exactly uh... is

92
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:22,260
fully is a senate he has one desire and i was not

93
00:05:22,260 --> 00:05:23,860
the acorn flash not thing

94
00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:25,980
whatever the hell that is the uh...

95
00:05:25,980 --> 00:05:29,860
it looks to me like an acorn yeah but it could be a prehistoric they should have

96
00:05:29,860 --> 00:05:37,740
come up with some awesome scrat like perfect hypostatic union between a nut

97
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:44,260
and an acorn they actually stole the idea for the acorn from me yeah I had an idea

98
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:53,180
for a bug that wants an M&M so I think I thought of an ET way long before that

99
00:05:53,180 --> 00:05:58,060
yeah an ET that wants a Reese's piece that's true ET is a scrat or a scrat is

100
00:05:58,060 --> 00:06:04,180
at ET. Scrap flies a UFO. Yeah ET has other interests dressing up like a damn

101
00:06:04,180 --> 00:06:09,340
girl. Scrap hiding in the closet. Drinking cola out the fridge. Uh-huh.

102
00:06:09,340 --> 00:06:14,620
I haven't seen ET in a while. He drinks beer and turns white. He goes nuts. He turns white later.

103
00:06:14,620 --> 00:06:18,420
He turns white not because he drank a beer but because he was in the woods.

104
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:27,060
He turns white every time he falls down. He falls down in the woods and then turns white.

105
00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:30,540
known about this strange alien species except that they turn white every time

106
00:06:30,540 --> 00:06:34,900
they fall down in the woods. It's so funny to gather like the rules of ET species

107
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:39,180
based off of his movie like yeah all the people from his planet love drinking

108
00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:45,540
soda and dressing up like girls. And then we watched yesterday the like the ride.

109
00:06:45,540 --> 00:06:49,780
Yeah we go back to the green planet. The fucking planet he just called it the

110
00:06:49,780 --> 00:06:54,660
green planet. Yeah. ET needs your help going back to the green planet. Well Earth is the blue

111
00:06:54,660 --> 00:07:00,700
planet right? Yeah. And Mars is the red planet. And Venus is also sort of...

112
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:05,700
Is it orange? I feel like I think it's orange. I want to think of Venus as

113
00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:11,820
green because it's like... Greenness. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. But I don't think it is.

114
00:07:11,820 --> 00:07:16,820
Well ET's teacher Botanicus. Botanicus. Needs your help. And Botanicus can really...

115
00:07:16,820 --> 00:07:21,780
he's really good at speaking. Yeah. So ET is a Scrat. Hello, welcome to the green. Scrat and ET are the same.

116
00:07:21,780 --> 00:07:25,220
The green planet is Scratlantis.

117
00:07:25,220 --> 00:07:29,060
Oh yeah. It's all a metaphor. There's a lot of parallels.

118
00:07:29,060 --> 00:07:34,220
Well there's also a mushroom that says "Welcome Home."

119
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:37,340
Where's that fall into the Scrat thing? That's an Alice in Wonderland.

120
00:07:37,340 --> 00:07:41,220
I thought E.T.'s whole thing was that he was like the most retarded guy from his planet but then

121
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:42,780
you go to his planet and everyone's like

122
00:07:42,780 --> 00:07:46,780
"Doo-wee-wee-boo-boo."

123
00:07:46,780 --> 00:07:52,180
I think we're I can't tell what I know of ET and what I just know from the robot

124
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:59,040
chicken thing yeah yeah I think he's that well he is I think all of his his

125
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:04,220
mental like abilities go to his brain I think all everything goes to his healing

126
00:08:04,220 --> 00:08:09,020
finger oh yeah okay you can't see yeah there's so much energy being used to

127
00:08:09,020 --> 00:08:16,660
his rat kind of has that but with his like scratch as I think I think that I

128
00:08:16,660 --> 00:08:22,220
guess that's great like on that nut scratch a co scrat has his acorn and et

129
00:08:22,220 --> 00:08:32,340
acorn would be the boy he's a sport is a boy by that logic was a nice touching

130
00:08:32,340 --> 00:08:35,780
the boy's finger right also et wants to go to his planet so he wants a planet

131
00:08:35,780 --> 00:08:52,140
could be is a corn yeah or a phone home is his not a phone is trapped on earth

132
00:08:52,140 --> 00:08:57,220
and he has to find a phone I guess seeing ET and be like oh yeah no I get it the

133
00:08:57,220 --> 00:08:59,220
the phone was his nut.

134
00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:01,220
(laughter)

135
00:09:01,220 --> 00:09:03,220
Like scrap.

136
00:09:03,220 --> 00:09:05,220
Watching Frankenstein like, oh that girl was his nut?

137
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:07,220
Where's E.T. the girl E.T.?

138
00:09:07,220 --> 00:09:09,220
True.

139
00:09:09,220 --> 00:09:11,220
That would be E.T.E.

140
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:13,220
That's because they would...

141
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:15,220
E.T.

142
00:09:15,220 --> 00:09:17,220
E.T.

143
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:19,220
It would be E.T.T.

144
00:09:19,220 --> 00:09:21,220
Extraterrestrial

145
00:09:21,220 --> 00:09:23,220
with tits and ass.

146
00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:25,220
Extra terrestrial with

147
00:09:25,220 --> 00:09:26,220
with tits and ass yeah.

148
00:09:26,220 --> 00:09:31,500
So does, now I'm thinking, now that we're going with a girl whose name is made of letters,

149
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:35,300
I'm thinking about Wally and Eva or Eve.

150
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:36,300
Yeah.

151
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:42,420
And then maybe that that's also maybe the center, the missing link between E.T. and

152
00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:43,420
Scrat.

153
00:09:43,420 --> 00:09:44,780
Wally's nut was fat people.

154
00:09:44,780 --> 00:09:45,780
No Wally's nut was trash.

155
00:09:45,780 --> 00:09:46,780
Trash, it was trash box.

156
00:09:46,780 --> 00:09:47,780
I never saw that movie.

157
00:09:47,780 --> 00:09:48,780
Yeah.

158
00:09:48,780 --> 00:09:53,980
Wally's nut wasn't trash, it was making a box out of trash.

159
00:09:53,980 --> 00:09:58,980
- Scrat is really like the genesis of a lot of different--

160
00:09:58,980 --> 00:10:03,020
- It's like a stock character, you know,

161
00:10:03,020 --> 00:10:05,300
it's an archetype that you can find in whatever.

162
00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:07,940
- Yeah, like the gay villain, or the gay hero,

163
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:11,140
or the gay dragon.

164
00:10:11,140 --> 00:10:16,140
- I mean, technically, Scrat's nut is a prospector's coin.

165
00:10:16,140 --> 00:10:17,620
(laughing)

166
00:10:17,620 --> 00:10:19,420
So let's keep going back then.

167
00:10:19,420 --> 00:10:21,060
- Well, the prospector, I don't think,

168
00:10:21,060 --> 00:10:23,940
I think it's more interesting gold than coins.

169
00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:28,140
looking for gold. I think everybody wants. I think that's like a human

170
00:10:28,140 --> 00:10:32,740
coin. I think the prospectors gold nugget nugget was a nut is a hue is

171
00:10:32,740 --> 00:10:36,540
the nut and then if you go further prospect humans, no actually because

172
00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:39,780
now I'm thinking about it or perhaps evaluate that because while the cave

173
00:10:39,780 --> 00:10:46,420
man's turkey leg as imagine extra extra the prospector got his. Oh my God

174
00:10:46,420 --> 00:10:49,820
while he's in a proper send off to the gold rush

175
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:57,860
their own term. He finally got his nugget. Wait, I don't get it. Why does he eat the nugget?

176
00:10:57,860 --> 00:11:03,420
It's like scrat. It's his nut. Yeah. Does he think he bites into the nugget to see if

177
00:11:03,420 --> 00:11:07,500
it's real? No, he does that with the coins to see if they're real. He could do it with

178
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:11,380
a nugget too. Even a fool's gold would break a man's tooth.

179
00:11:11,380 --> 00:11:15,380
Well, so here's what I'm thinking. I feel like, okay, here, I would like to introduce

180
00:11:15,380 --> 00:11:19,220
a coin. That's eating it. He puts the nugget in his wallet and then it turns into a coin

181
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:23,020
I want to introduce a new dimension of this which is the prospector he wants a

182
00:11:23,020 --> 00:11:26,980
nugget and he wants a coin this is his dual acorns and if we look at Scrat

183
00:11:26,980 --> 00:11:32,900
Scrat wants his acorn but he also wants Scratay yeah and a family exactly

184
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:36,700
doesn't he have a son so well that's baby Scrat who he adopted baby Scrat

185
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:42,620
specter Atlantis that's prosperous Francisco yeah that's El Dorado yeah

186
00:11:42,620 --> 00:11:48,280
Rondo okay so yeah maybe the hollow earth is it the rod

187
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:59,540
gold the city of gold has no people in robes and our legs pious it's just a

188
00:11:59,540 --> 00:12:02,540
bunch of hairy guys dancing and chewing tobacco.

189
00:12:02,540 --> 00:12:04,540
Everybody's got a golden jug.

190
00:12:04,540 --> 00:12:06,540
They all got a golden jug.

191
00:12:06,540 --> 00:12:10,540
And that makes sense because then the prospector sees El Dorado, the city of gold.

192
00:12:10,540 --> 00:12:14,540
He goes gold crazy like Scrat goes nut crazy when he sees the big nut in Scratlantis.

193
00:12:14,540 --> 00:12:17,540
In Scratlantis, if you guys aren't aware, Scrat sees a big nut.

194
00:12:17,540 --> 00:12:21,540
The Scratlantis guy says, "Don't submit to these base instincts, Scrat.

195
00:12:21,540 --> 00:12:25,540
Be more than a squirrel." And then Scrat goes, "Be more than a Scrat."

196
00:12:25,540 --> 00:12:28,540
And then he, well he says, "Be more than a squirrel." Now I think about it, doesn't he?

197
00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:31,900
Well, he says don't be more than a rodent rodent. That's what he says and

198
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:36,220
then and then scrap holes would be way too confusing. Yeah, and then he will

199
00:12:36,220 --> 00:12:39,020
yeah be more than squirrel. He's more. She's a squirrel rat. He's already more

200
00:12:39,020 --> 00:12:43,740
than the squirrel. He pulls the nut out of out of the nut holder and it's a

201
00:12:43,740 --> 00:12:48,140
drain and it's a drain that sinks. Gratilantis the prospector goes to El

202
00:12:48,140 --> 00:12:52,700
Prospero and he sees the and he sees the gold. He starts mining it and he

203
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:56,300
destroys it because he goes crazy and they say right. They say rise up

204
00:12:56,300 --> 00:13:01,420
brother become more than a prospector mm-hmm he's gonna become Jerry yeah yeah

205
00:13:01,420 --> 00:13:06,860
that was his name so who predates the prospector who is the caveman yeah and

206
00:13:06,860 --> 00:13:10,160
what they was also looking for gold coin well caveman I guess was actually was

207
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:18,080
post-rat though it came in Oh scratch the originator yeah because dinosaurs

208
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:22,380
didn't want stuff it's like the pre ice age it's like the evolution did want

209
00:13:22,380 --> 00:13:27,380
want volcanoes but not like scrap Eve wanted an apple yeah, but that was

210
00:13:27,380 --> 00:13:31,580
after she was also yeah. I was way before no because that was humans.

211
00:13:31,580 --> 00:13:35,180
That was when humans were created humans came after scrat what's

212
00:13:35,180 --> 00:13:39,180
great was leading alongside each other. No yeah, it's great was already

213
00:13:39,180 --> 00:13:41,680
alive. I think Caleb might be right about this. They lived alongside

214
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:44,880
each other at the very there's a Neanderthal in the first ice age.

215
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:47,980
Yeah, but that Neanderthal but so you think Eve was there a baby Eve

216
00:13:47,980 --> 00:13:50,780
is more fully evolved than a Neanderthal though. There's a baby in

217
00:13:50,780 --> 00:13:55,660
one right now if you saw he was a complete was a monkey what they do with

218
00:13:55,660 --> 00:14:01,180
the baby I think the baby gets reunited with his clan at the end yeah so there's

219
00:14:01,180 --> 00:14:15,260
there's there's other he has a nice age right there's one baby in all of ice age

220
00:14:15,260 --> 00:14:19,060
and he also wants a nut yeah there's got to be something that's that bridges the

221
00:14:19,060 --> 00:14:23,640
gap between prospector and and they can't they can't they can't have been no

222
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:28,180
scrat and just prospector I think there was maybe it was the gist well scrat was

223
00:14:28,180 --> 00:14:31,160
around for a long time that's true we kept getting frozen and

224
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:36,980
and thought out yeah yeah I mean I think he pretty much carried the torch himself

225
00:14:36,980 --> 00:14:40,860
the entire time yeah I think it was around like just in in all the history

226
00:14:40,860 --> 00:14:45,040
before the Wild West - like he was am I imagining this or in one of the ice ages

227
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:48,240
wait I can't guess what you're about to say yeah does he cook an acorn over a

228
00:14:48,240 --> 00:15:04,800
fire and it turns into popcorn which begs the question of like what is that

229
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:06,800
That's what I'm saying, it's a scrat corn.

230
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:08,800
Scrat coin!

231
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:10,800
Coin, yeah.

232
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:12,800
It's a coin!

233
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:14,800
Acorn is acorn.

234
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:16,800
Oh my God.

235
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:18,800
Wait, so yeah, he cooks it and it becomes popcorn.

236
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:20,800
Are you doing a check on this right now?

237
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:22,800
I'm doing a check on this.

238
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:24,800
What were you about to search?

239
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:26,800
I don't remember that.

240
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:28,800
I was literally about to search Caleb coin.

241
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:30,800
Caleb coin!

242
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:32,800
It comes up.

243
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:36,960
that's kind of the modern example is Caleb with his coin. Yeah, I always

244
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:43,200
try to get his coin pretty often. All right, wait, scrap. I was trying to

245
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:48,640
does he does he like get frozen for like a like millions of years and he

246
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:52,040
like they have defied in like modern day. There's okay. Now here's what I'm

247
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:54,600
thinking about. I don't think I've seen. I think I've seen maybe the first

248
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:57,720
two ice age movies and those were that was a long time ago that I saw those,

249
00:15:57,720 --> 00:16:01,120
but I do remember seeing previews for a movie called Ice Age Dawn of the

250
00:16:01,140 --> 00:16:05,060
dinosaurs and the dawn of the dinosaurs is before the ice age.

251
00:16:05,060 --> 00:16:10,280
Yeah, I sage was post dinosaurs totally so so what's going on

252
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:12,320
there. I don't know. I think there's like I think maybe they

253
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:15,520
find a secret island like a Godzilla Island. Oh, yeah. Oh,

254
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:19,740
yeah, like a world like a leash the dinosaur. Okay, but so also

255
00:16:19,740 --> 00:16:21,860
something that I read about when I was reading so many videos

256
00:16:21,860 --> 00:16:25,880
just called scrap popcorn by the way when I was reading about the

257
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:29,420
cultural impact of scrat on the Wikipedia page. It does he does

258
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:33,960
UFO so I think there's a chance that that's right see if the scrat is okay

259
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:38,280
let's see what's my man this is like a fire the first one so he's cooking a

260
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:43,160
marshmallow oh he's trying to thaw out the laws out the acorn I see and he's

261
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:50,240
trying to make sure oh yeah it turns into a popcorn I found a thing here real

262
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:55,480
life ice age scratch stretches impossibly far for tasty nut okay so

263
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:57,400
So what year is that from?

264
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:58,400
This is from 9/11/2018.

265
00:16:58,400 --> 00:16:59,400
That's from maybe...

266
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:03,600
That photo's from 10 million years ago.

267
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:06,840
Oh my god, Osama bin Laden!

268
00:17:06,840 --> 00:17:08,140
There's more than one photo here.

269
00:17:08,140 --> 00:17:10,600
Osama bin Laden was a scrat.

270
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:11,600
That's right.

271
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:14,600
And his nut was doing a thing to a tower.

272
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:15,600
He had a nasty, nasty nut.

273
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:16,920
His nut was a plane.

274
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:18,760
Well, the towers were like the...

275
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:19,760
His nut was fear.

276
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:20,760
No, okay, listen, listen, listen.

277
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:21,760
Let's be honest.

278
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:22,760
Get out of view.

279
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:27,640
the towers were the frozen acorn the plane was the campfire and then the

280
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:33,120
collapsed towers the popcorn I think that's what I was up you wanted to fly

281
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:40,040
the plane close enough to the tower that it thawed oh yeah

282
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:56,880
No, thawing the towers when the plane, it's like when in a movie, the plane flies by a

283
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:58,960
tower and all the glass windows shatter.

284
00:17:58,960 --> 00:17:59,960
Oh yeah.

285
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:00,960
You don't want any windows.

286
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:01,960
Going like a supersonic speed.

287
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:02,960
Yeah, because windows are like ice.

288
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:07,800
Because windows, exactly like Rodin in Final Wars, windows look like ice and breaking ice

289
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:08,800
is thawing it.

290
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:11,040
Also, the twin towers were frozen in ice.

291
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:12,040
Yeah.

292
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:13,040
Yeah.

293
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:14,040
Yeah.

294
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:15,040
And he messed up and he popped corn in them.

295
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:16,040
Only on that day though.

296
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:17,040
Yeah, they got frozen.

297
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:18,040
Every other day they were fine.

298
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:19,040
Yeah.

299
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:24,360
everybody in the entire building would have gone like oh yeah I wonder if they're

300
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:29,440
like scratch truthers who are like I'm not wouldn't do that I know wouldn't

301
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:33,500
become popcorn I think there's no way I'm not wouldn't want to the edge of the

302
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:37,640
dinosaurs like that it was that yeah that's what I mean is like what the it's

303
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:42,200
not an acorn wait it's scratt launch the age of the dinosaurs yeah I'm guessing

304
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:47,640
he's kind of responsible for every bad thing that I know these yeah oh my god

305
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:52,520
he's gonna start the collision course the collision course is that what it's

306
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:54,960
called collision that's where it's one movie called collision that's the one

307
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:57,960
where he flies a UFO and he's yeah meteors at the earth so there's one

308
00:18:57,960 --> 00:19:02,160
called collision course and one called continental drift yeah how are those not

309
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:07,920
hold up yeah well can we look up a list of I'll look up the list of ice age also

310
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:10,920
did you say there's a show called scrat tails yeah that's the one that came out

311
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:14,640
yesterday holy fuck and that's that is what the head the companion piece where

312
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:20,080
scrat spoiler alert we got it came out yesterday yeah and they immediately shut

313
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:25,640
down yeah it was their last thing I think okay I sage I sage the meltdown I sage

314
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:30,600
dawn of the dinosaurs I sage continental drift I sage collision course the ice

315
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:36,200
age adventures of buck wild buck wild and then I sage scrat tales I don't know

316
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:41,400
but well rat tails is a and well don't forget the short films gone nutty no time

317
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:46,160
for nuts surviving Sid, Scrat's Continental Crack-Up, Scrat's Continental Crack-Up Part

318
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:50,480
2, Cosmic Scrat-tastrophe, Scrat Spaced Out, and The End.

319
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:51,480
Oh my god.

320
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:54,400
Oh I think these are the Scrat videos we were talking about.

321
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:55,400
Yeah, we were talking about the Scrat videos.

322
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:57,440
Those are the short films that opened Ice Age.

323
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:59,280
That's another thing that I forgot to mention.

324
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:04,480
This video, the video of Scrat getting his nut is called, it was uploaded to YouTube under

325
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:07,960
the name The End by a YouTube channel just called Finale.

326
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:08,960
Whoa.

327
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:12,460
I guess they don't have access to the blue sky. Yeah, I guess that's just the video

328
00:20:12,460 --> 00:20:17,720
It's the video of him just walking up eating his nut and then why should put all the finales for everything on that channel?

329
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:24,680
Yeah, that only makes sense. Yeah, I mean there's no finale quite like this one though. Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa?

330
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:30,980
Yeah, don't say that cosmic scratastrophe is a 2015 animated short film directed by Michael Thurmeyer

331
00:20:30,980 --> 00:20:37,900
It was originally released in theaters alongside the Peanuts movie the short once again follows scrat who discovers a front a flying saucer

332
00:20:38,180 --> 00:20:42,480
they're frozen in a block of ice and with a video that isn't a part of ice age.

333
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:48,880
This is a video that open the hold up and accidentally powers it on and ends

334
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:52,700
up creating the solar system through a series of mishaps.

335
00:20:52,700 --> 00:20:59,180
Wait, so he so so there's no sun yeah.

336
00:20:59,180 --> 00:21:06,680
He created the solar system, so it is pre eve. Oh my he's God's grad is God

337
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:10,620
it's got to be oh yeah i was reading someone i was reading theory like

338
00:21:10,620 --> 00:21:14,820
something they say that's right but other people say that the nut is god

339
00:21:14,820 --> 00:21:19,580
that's a good point that

340
00:21:19,580 --> 00:21:25,260
well ok wait i have another huge i have a big development here for the next

341
00:21:25,260 --> 00:21:30,220
scratch video scratch spaced out scratch based out as a short film that compiles

342
00:21:30,220 --> 00:21:33,460
all scratch scenes from ich collision course with a few unique scenes at the

343
00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:37,700
end okay following the events of ice age collision course scrat is heading back

344
00:21:37,700 --> 00:21:42,060
to earth in the saucer an acorn shaped ship appears and pulls the acorn with

345
00:21:42,060 --> 00:21:48,740
scrat holding on to it in the ship three alien squirrels aka scrat zones

346
00:21:48,740 --> 00:21:55,460
finding scrap blasted away from the acorn so he okay so he is like an alien

347
00:21:55,460 --> 00:22:01,580
he's like he's an anunaki he's an alien dude he created the world or no he's a

348
00:22:01,580 --> 00:22:04,900
nephilim he's earthbound he's the one right the one they left behind like a

349
00:22:04,900 --> 00:22:09,020
progenitor yeah yeah scratch zone my god scratch zones

350
00:22:09,020 --> 00:22:18,300
scrat is on oh my god it's a minute sexy dude it's scratch a but she's blue

351
00:22:18,300 --> 00:22:25,580
they send their women oh my god oh geez so the scratch zones are are like an

352
00:22:25,580 --> 00:22:30,780
ancient race of aliens squirrel red alien red oh and they're big like maybe

353
00:22:30,780 --> 00:22:36,580
Yeah, it's like our idea of squirrels and rats kind of came from them. Maybe our cave paintings of Scratz on

354
00:22:36,580 --> 00:22:43,060
Look at how big they are compared to scrap. That's how let me see their size. Oh my god. Their size is immense

355
00:22:43,060 --> 00:22:46,940
They're so huge. So do you think they ever got their nuts?

356
00:22:46,940 --> 00:22:50,740
Scraps on leader hip by mr. Screenshot on TV and

357
00:22:50,740 --> 00:22:55,340
Yeah, you think do you think that maybe

358
00:22:55,340 --> 00:22:58,340
Scraps on sir Scratts who got their nuts. Oh

359
00:22:59,340 --> 00:23:02,980
Oh shit, so he's trying to ascend and maybe he's just maybe he is mentally

360
00:23:02,980 --> 00:23:06,260
challenging. He just it just took him this long. I'll check this out. So I

361
00:23:06,260 --> 00:23:06,940
think if anything,

362
00:23:06,940 --> 00:23:12,180
I don't think so able to resist the temptation for long. How are they

363
00:23:12,180 --> 00:23:16,260
connected to Scratlantis? Because the Scratlantis guys aren't blue. Those are

364
00:23:16,260 --> 00:23:19,260
I guess that's that's what it is. Those are the Nephilim and then the Scrats

365
00:23:19,260 --> 00:23:23,060
on the on and on. What how does Scrat factor into all that then? Because why

366
00:23:23,060 --> 00:23:27,580
is he not in the in Scratlantis? Scrat is just Odysseus. He's just out of

367
00:23:27,580 --> 00:23:29,580
there. He's not a part of this group.

368
00:23:29,580 --> 00:23:31,580
This has to be a deleted scene, right?

369
00:23:31,580 --> 00:23:33,580
That? No, that's in the movie.

370
00:23:33,580 --> 00:23:35,580
That's in the movie?

371
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:37,580
Oh my god.

372
00:23:37,580 --> 00:23:39,580
Oh my god.

373
00:23:39,580 --> 00:23:41,580
This is Scrat.

374
00:23:41,580 --> 00:23:43,580
He's small and he's putting

375
00:23:43,580 --> 00:23:45,580
his leg, his penis in

376
00:23:45,580 --> 00:23:47,580
between Scratazon's

377
00:23:47,580 --> 00:23:49,580
high heels. I like that a lot.

378
00:23:49,580 --> 00:23:51,580
I think that Scrat might be like a

379
00:23:51,580 --> 00:23:53,580
messiah type thing

380
00:23:53,580 --> 00:23:55,580
where he's like, he maybe

381
00:23:55,580 --> 00:23:59,140
he has the he's he's carrying he's he's he needs to bring something about or

382
00:23:59,140 --> 00:24:06,980
something because he even he creates the solar system right yeah he's placed by

383
00:24:06,980 --> 00:24:12,500
the scratch zones to invent popcorn so are we doing another we do a scratch

384
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:17,820
list is that even possible I think this is a premium episode another scratch is

385
00:24:17,820 --> 00:24:22,740
on here Wow yeah I was also looking up scrap horn before I came and very

386
00:24:22,740 --> 00:24:25,140
important to put the R in there. Yeah, and you're looking at

387
00:24:25,140 --> 00:24:26,940
yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,

388
00:24:26,940 --> 00:24:29,740
yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,

389
00:24:29,740 --> 00:24:31,740
yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,

390
00:24:31,740 --> 00:24:33,740
yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,

391
00:24:33,740 --> 00:24:35,740
yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,

392
00:24:35,740 --> 00:24:37,740
yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,

393
00:24:37,740 --> 00:24:39,740
yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,

394
00:24:39,740 --> 00:24:41,740
yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,

395
00:24:41,740 --> 00:24:43,740
yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,

396
00:24:43,740 --> 00:24:46,540
that was good. He's like well, you want something for so long,

397
00:24:46,540 --> 00:24:47,140
you're not

398
00:24:47,140 --> 00:24:54,740
and the picture is of him after having cream pied

399
00:24:54,740 --> 00:24:57,340
rat get cream pie.

400
00:24:57,340 --> 00:25:00,240
And he says, well, you want something for so long, you're

401
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:00,940
not well.

402
00:25:00,940 --> 00:25:04,040
That's probably what it is.

403
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:07,140
You know, he's meant to spread the Scratts on kind of DNA

404
00:25:07,140 --> 00:25:10,240
through as many as you want to get any species as possible.

405
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:13,140
Yeah, yeah, kind of like spread enlightenment or whatever a

406
00:25:13,140 --> 00:25:21,040
genetic memory of being from space from space from space from space. I just I

407
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:25,840
need I need to like I need like an interview with the with the right. Yeah,

408
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:32,240
I need a one-on-one with scrap. I need that so badly. Yeah, I really do think

409
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:36,740
that she I mean wait, what what is scratch? What's her job now? I bet this

410
00:25:36,740 --> 00:25:40,840
woman to me. She's a bus driver now. Wait the woman who created the initially

411
00:25:40,940 --> 00:25:45,340
let me pull it up it said she has to this this be a she's a she was a fashion

412
00:25:45,340 --> 00:25:52,980
designer named Ivy supersonic that's no Ivy she's an alien well that's what I

413
00:25:52,980 --> 00:25:56,980
mean is like the more complicated real name was Ivy Silberstein the more like

414
00:25:56,980 --> 00:26:01,500
fucking insane she has to feel yeah like they stole this and they made it about

415
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:08,820
God and space yeah yeah truly my shitty idea a rat who's combined with a squirrel

416
00:26:08,820 --> 00:26:16,580
is now the creator of the universe. Listen to this, on February 13th 2002 Ivy

417
00:26:16,580 --> 00:26:19,980
Supersonic filed a lawsuit against Fox claiming that she had created the

418
00:26:19,980 --> 00:26:23,900
character in May 1999 after seeing a squirrel rat hybrid in Skidmore

419
00:26:23,900 --> 00:26:30,540
College's Case Green and intended it to be the next Mickey Mouse. Wow. It is.

420
00:26:30,540 --> 00:26:35,020
It is yeah. How did she, like people who like claimed it. She called her character Scrat and

421
00:26:35,020 --> 00:26:39,620
and pitched it to numerous celebrities and studios from 1999 to 2001. You're

422
00:26:39,620 --> 00:26:44,220
right. It was just like her at parties. Yeah. But listen to this. Although she

423
00:26:44,220 --> 00:26:49,080
was unwilling to accept the $50,000 deal, she was offered by Urban Box Office

424
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:53,020
Network for a web series, believing the character to be worth seven figures.

425
00:26:53,020 --> 00:26:57,700
Wow. Wait, so somebody actually turned down $50,000. Oh, she's right. They

426
00:26:57,700 --> 00:27:00,580
stole it. Yeah. Yeah. 'Cause no one's gonna be like,

427
00:27:01,780 --> 00:27:06,340
people are gonna know that we stole this this squirrel rat I mean having scrat

428
00:27:06,340 --> 00:27:10,480
having scrat and be like this sticking to your guns and saying it's worth seven

429
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:15,540
figures she was right she was right yeah but being able to know that yeah I think

430
00:27:15,540 --> 00:27:18,500
getting kind of I think they just brute force scrat and said I don't think

431
00:27:18,500 --> 00:27:21,700
there's anything special about scrat I don't think scrat was supposed to be in

432
00:27:21,700 --> 00:27:25,220
ice age and then they were like we have we have this we need this yeah we stole

433
00:27:25,220 --> 00:27:29,220
We stole this from a woman, we have to use it.

434
00:27:29,220 --> 00:27:30,220
Yeah.

435
00:27:30,220 --> 00:27:31,220
Wait.

436
00:27:31,220 --> 00:27:33,220
I think she definitely grew.

437
00:27:33,220 --> 00:27:35,220
What's Mickey Mouse's nut?

438
00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:36,220
Is it...

439
00:27:36,220 --> 00:27:37,220
Minnie's pussy.

440
00:27:37,220 --> 00:27:38,220
No, come on.

441
00:27:38,220 --> 00:27:39,220
No.

442
00:27:39,220 --> 00:27:42,220
He's kind of a nutless scrat.

443
00:27:42,220 --> 00:27:45,220
He's sort of a nutless scrat.

444
00:27:45,220 --> 00:27:50,220
I guess at first it was a steamboat, but then where did he go from there?

445
00:27:50,220 --> 00:27:52,220
No, he was driving the steamboat.

446
00:27:52,220 --> 00:27:54,220
Yeah, the steamboat was supposed to get to safety.

447
00:27:54,220 --> 00:28:00,040
to safety but he wasn't like so he could kiss me he's not as whistling there we

448
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:10,020
go voice yeah or big ears crazy gloves it could be something with like it maybe

449
00:28:10,020 --> 00:28:17,500
his nut is just like like Disneyland or like Disney the brain yeah movies oh my

450
00:28:17,500 --> 00:28:26,260
God wait more wizard who's frozen Disney oh my god Walt Disney's the nut oh my

451
00:28:26,260 --> 00:28:31,180
god he has to make pop you're not a ball this may be called frozen mm-hmm and

452
00:28:31,180 --> 00:28:37,260
frozen - right yeah and ice age it doesn't really have to do with this but

453
00:28:37,260 --> 00:28:43,660
but you think about how it's frozen - frozen thing - frozen

454
00:28:43,660 --> 00:28:45,540
- No, we need to turn Walt Disney into popcorn.

455
00:28:45,540 --> 00:28:46,820
- Exactly, his head is the nut, yeah.

456
00:28:46,820 --> 00:28:48,060
- Oh my God.

457
00:28:48,060 --> 00:28:49,460
- Turning him into popcorn will create

458
00:28:49,460 --> 00:28:51,060
the second solar system.

459
00:28:51,060 --> 00:28:52,400
It'll be a reset.

460
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:53,240
- Yeah, and he needs to go to--

461
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:56,160
- That will allow the Scratzons to come back in

462
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:57,980
and fix their flawed creation.

463
00:28:57,980 --> 00:28:59,060
They're the--

464
00:28:59,060 --> 00:29:02,200
- Oh my God, what if his head is just the plug

465
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:05,340
that sends Disney rocketing to the bottom of the sea, though?

466
00:29:05,340 --> 00:29:06,420
- Yeah. - Damn.

467
00:29:06,420 --> 00:29:07,940
- What if he picks up the head and it's just--

468
00:29:07,940 --> 00:29:11,900
- Oh my God, the Scratlanteans are like the Demiurge

469
00:29:11,900 --> 00:29:16,900
and then the Scradzons are like the Sophia, the creator.

470
00:29:16,900 --> 00:29:17,900
It's Gnosticism.

471
00:29:17,900 --> 00:29:20,260
- Scrad is trying to warn us, dude.

472
00:29:20,260 --> 00:29:21,380
It's really scary.

473
00:29:21,380 --> 00:29:22,220
- It's terrifying.

474
00:29:22,220 --> 00:29:24,620
- And also Scrooge McDuck owns coins.

475
00:29:24,620 --> 00:29:26,580
- He's a guy with a million nuts.

476
00:29:26,580 --> 00:29:27,980
- He's like the prospector.

477
00:29:27,980 --> 00:29:29,620
- He's like the guy who shows you

478
00:29:29,620 --> 00:29:32,020
when you have all the nuts that you want, it doesn't.

479
00:29:32,020 --> 00:29:34,380
- Yeah, and you're still unhappy.

480
00:29:34,380 --> 00:29:36,180
- You're gonna have all the nuts you want,

481
00:29:36,180 --> 00:29:39,380
you still got three bad nephews you gotta take care of.

482
00:29:39,380 --> 00:29:41,380
- And they're going on tails together.

483
00:29:41,380 --> 00:29:48,420
And their dad? Coveting coins and money and it would be awesome like yeah

484
00:29:48,420 --> 00:29:51,620
because millionaires aren't happy with all that money but if money was edible

485
00:29:51,620 --> 00:29:55,540
they probably could get over that feeling of empty like oh I've amassed

486
00:29:55,540 --> 00:29:58,740
all this wealth what am I supposed to you just eat it you eat all the money.

487
00:29:58,740 --> 00:30:02,980
I mean you can still eat a coin but it doesn't make it like a coin is like the

488
00:30:02,980 --> 00:30:08,740
last money. You can eat a dollar. You can put a dollar in a dehydrator and eat it like jerky.

489
00:30:08,740 --> 00:30:10,740
It's just too much money to eat, I guess.

490
00:30:10,740 --> 00:30:11,240
Yeah.

491
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:14,740
If the money was tinier and it tasted better, I guess then that would be a difference.

492
00:30:14,740 --> 00:30:15,740
They'd get a chocolate coin.

493
00:30:15,740 --> 00:30:17,240
Food used to be money, I guess.

494
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:17,740
Yeah.

495
00:30:17,740 --> 00:30:18,240
Yeah.

496
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:19,740
I don't care about food anymore.

497
00:30:19,740 --> 00:30:21,740
Yeah, now you just make food in a lab.

498
00:30:21,740 --> 00:30:22,740
Or your house.

499
00:30:22,740 --> 00:30:23,240
In money.

500
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:23,740
Yeah.

501
00:30:23,740 --> 00:30:25,740
My house is a lab. I'm a scientist.

502
00:30:25,740 --> 00:30:26,740
Yep.

503
00:30:26,740 --> 00:30:28,240
I call my kitchen my lab.

504
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:30,240
I call my house my lab. I already said that, so.

505
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:32,240
You can't call your kitchen your lab, because my whole house is a lab.

506
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:33,240
The kitchen's the lab.

507
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:33,740
No.

508
00:30:33,740 --> 00:30:34,740
That's where you make up the food.

509
00:30:34,740 --> 00:30:36,240
I'm the guy with the lab house.

510
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:37,740
I call my penis my lab.

511
00:30:37,740 --> 00:30:39,740
You know my black lab

512
00:30:39,740 --> 00:30:41,420
No

513
00:30:41,420 --> 00:30:47,500
Like a dog like the dog right, but why did you why did you he said penis and you said black lab?

514
00:30:47,500 --> 00:30:52,780
What what was I gonna chocolate lab no, but just why are you just are you just doing like word?

515
00:30:52,780 --> 00:30:55,940
Association with lab and now you're saying he has a black penis

516
00:30:55,940 --> 00:30:59,980
Interesting

517
00:31:03,220 --> 00:31:14,020
think he might is it darker than your face no you know if it's darker than your

518
00:31:14,020 --> 00:31:17,300
face it means you have cancer

519
00:31:31,620 --> 00:31:36,340
I miss tricking people like that yeah I feel like it you can't get away with

520
00:31:36,340 --> 00:31:41,460
that anymore no yeah probably go to jail it is it's all not hey not to bring this

521
00:31:41,460 --> 00:31:47,980
back to scrap but please Tom and Jerry are kind of like each other's nut that's

522
00:31:47,980 --> 00:31:54,020
true they're kind of a dual system well no Jerry doesn't want Tom Jerry would

523
00:31:54,020 --> 00:32:00,100
no no Jerry wants to trick Jerry loves fucking with Tom that's revenge

524
00:32:00,100 --> 00:32:03,700
really is not a nice he's not and he looks like a little bit

525
00:32:03,700 --> 00:32:07,980
he is the night but he had not he's like if the night jerry can never get to imagine

526
00:32:07,980 --> 00:32:11,500
if the not have a very full of their always rolling all that happens in time

527
00:32:11,500 --> 00:32:13,540
to return to a very calm jerry

528
00:32:13,540 --> 00:32:16,980
tom pretty much gets pretty close though i don't know that i had is not and i

529
00:32:16,980 --> 00:32:18,060
think that's actually

530
00:32:18,060 --> 00:32:21,860
yet i think i'm ready and i didn't want it to the not cycle you can't get it is

531
00:32:21,860 --> 00:32:24,180
technically jerry's always eating his night

532
00:32:24,180 --> 00:32:27,220
which is fucking with tom will his notice cheese

533
00:32:27,220 --> 00:32:30,860
well he's like he's like a okay he's like this kind of like a nut order

534
00:32:30,860 --> 00:32:33,100
it's like everybody has a notion

535
00:32:33,100 --> 00:32:35,380
yes no for another day

536
00:32:35,380 --> 00:32:38,340
that's the only other it's the best thing dot dot like

537
00:32:38,340 --> 00:32:39,100
spike

538
00:32:39,100 --> 00:32:41,620
did to tom is his not but but

539
00:32:41,620 --> 00:32:48,620
no no but i don't know is not know the mom's not is the dog and jerry

540
00:32:51,060 --> 00:32:54,060
but jerry serious smile.

541
00:32:54,060 --> 00:33:01,260
I meant to jerry teams up with spike to what to get Tom. Sometimes your nut can

542
00:33:01,260 --> 00:33:02,260
become your friend.

543
00:33:02,260 --> 00:33:07,660
That's fine. No, no, no, no, because jerry is not spikes. Not Tom is spikes.

544
00:33:07,660 --> 00:33:10,760
Not you already. You said it. You said it right there. Jerry's not the dog is

545
00:33:10,760 --> 00:33:17,660
Jerry's scratay and that's a jerry is jerry's jerry's nut is the cheese. Okay,

546
00:33:17,660 --> 00:33:22,460
that's this huge that it brings up and his scrat a is fucking with Tom and

547
00:33:22,460 --> 00:33:25,380
teaming up with spike

548
00:33:25,380 --> 00:33:34,300
two things and all he's not a scratch a well we're gonna grab a be like is his

549
00:33:34,300 --> 00:33:37,980
scratch it can't be someone's not wouldn't scratch no it's not a great

550
00:33:37,980 --> 00:33:42,140
taste not a study has a every scrat has a nut and a scratch a right but you just

551
00:33:42,140 --> 00:33:46,380
said scratch a is his nut no I did well if I did I didn't mean to that's not

552
00:33:46,380 --> 00:33:50,060
what I'm trying to say. Okay, but you messed up big time. We're not

553
00:33:50,060 --> 00:33:55,140
even saying shit like scratay. Run it back. He said scratay is his nut.

554
00:33:55,140 --> 00:33:58,380
I think you did say scratay is his nut, which just makes no sense.

555
00:33:58,380 --> 00:34:01,700
Okay, then let me start. His scrat has a scratay. His cheese is his

556
00:34:01,700 --> 00:34:06,460
nut and his scratay is fucking with Tom. Yes, but you also said his

557
00:34:06,460 --> 00:34:11,060
cheese is fucking... Wait, hold on. Scratay is his nut. Scratay's not

558
00:34:11,060 --> 00:34:19,580
nuts stop saying that that's not possible wait sorry he's not is cheese

559
00:34:19,580 --> 00:34:28,260
teaming up with Rex and fucking with Tom yeah

560
00:34:35,260 --> 00:34:37,260
You're inventing new characters

561
00:34:37,260 --> 00:34:40,100
Rex is my Tom and Jerry

562
00:34:40,100 --> 00:34:44,620
I made up Rex Rex Rex is an alien. He comes into Tom and Jerry's house

563
00:34:44,620 --> 00:34:50,300
He comes in at Tom and Jerry's house, and yeah, he has his own nut. It's a real nut

564
00:34:50,300 --> 00:34:53,060
He's looking for almonds in the kitchen

565
00:34:53,060 --> 00:35:01,100
And the aliens from science me Jerry was there water was there Jerry

566
00:35:03,700 --> 00:35:05,700
Water with yeah

567
00:35:05,700 --> 00:35:11,720
No Gibson was Tom water was like an anti nut but in Battle, Los Angeles water was

568
00:35:11,720 --> 00:35:19,300
So water is and to it in water is that either your night? It's your Jerry sometimes your scratch a

569
00:35:19,300 --> 00:35:22,100
scratch Jerry ice

570
00:35:28,620 --> 00:35:34,680
No, no, no, he's he's Jerry. No, Tom is his ice is his time

571
00:35:34,680 --> 00:35:43,460
Because he's running around from but sometimes he gets the better of the way, but no, but Jerry Jerry always gets the better of Tom

572
00:35:43,460 --> 00:35:45,460
Yeah, what do you know? It's better the ice

573
00:35:45,460 --> 00:35:53,940
One time and that was that's the end of this Tom's never gonna get Jerry

574
00:35:54,780 --> 00:35:58,580
goodbye time right scratch has no time that's timeless scratch timeless

575
00:35:58,580 --> 00:36:05,860
scratches grad is timeless because he is Tom yes and and his nut is also kind of

576
00:36:05,860 --> 00:36:11,540
his notice is Jerry yeah no the yeah that's what I'm saying is that I fight

577
00:36:11,540 --> 00:36:21,220
spike spike spike yeah Isis is spike what about popcorn popcorn is what is that

578
00:36:21,220 --> 00:36:26,540
Well, popcorn is like when popcorn is what popcorn is like when Jerry drinks

579
00:36:26,540 --> 00:36:29,060
the potion and gets really strong yeah, yeah,

580
00:36:29,060 --> 00:36:38,820
food to coast to the tower yeah exactly yeah and yeah yeah yeah yeah, so then

581
00:36:38,820 --> 00:36:46,220
and then popcorns kind of like the TSA. I guess yeah, I mean I still I'm not you

582
00:36:46,220 --> 00:36:50,820
try to bring a not so old TSA. I'm not sold on that being a one to one Tom and

583
00:36:50,860 --> 00:36:54,120
Jerry to scrat and no, I don't think it is a one to one. I think that Tom and

584
00:36:54,120 --> 00:36:57,620
Jerry is I think Tom and Jerry is a binary scrat system because the nut

585
00:36:57,620 --> 00:37:04,120
never gets the best of scrat. The nut doesn't do any the nuts just a nut man

586
00:37:04,120 --> 00:37:08,320
and I don't rock you can eat and I'm not I'm serious. I'm not convinced. It's

587
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:12,060
the same nut every time. I don't think it is. I don't think it is because he

588
00:37:12,060 --> 00:37:15,360
turns one of them into popcorn. It can't go back. I think sometimes the nut I

589
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:18,420
just watched the video of the nut. It got hollowed out and it was a map to

590
00:37:18,420 --> 00:37:23,400
Gratlantis so was that true mm-hmm that's how he founds Gratlantis he was like

591
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:30,120
trying to not holy scratt scratt on a nut that's crazy you ask he was trying to

592
00:37:30,120 --> 00:37:42,380
eat the nut then I didn't know if he like takes a bite out of the nut and

593
00:37:42,380 --> 00:37:48,860
sees the map inside. He would eat the map. He's holding a hollowed out acorn and it has a map on it. I don't know who did that.

594
00:37:48,860 --> 00:37:56,940
Wait which one like who did that? The whole nut is hollowed out? Yeah. How does he see he looks in it

595
00:37:56,940 --> 00:38:01,660
and there's a map? Yeah it's like the shell of the outside of the nut. Oh the shell or the

596
00:38:01,660 --> 00:38:07,180
which one? Because I saw the video of him eating the nut. He eats the nut shell and all.

597
00:38:07,180 --> 00:38:11,180
Except that neither except he doesn't eat the he doesn't eat the hat. He doesn't eat the hat. He

598
00:38:11,180 --> 00:38:14,960
he doesn't need the hat so it's like he's holding the hat and then there's like a

599
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:19,640
fingernail shell that comes there's a finger involved there's a fingernail

600
00:38:19,640 --> 00:38:24,440
shaped like a fingernail that comes out of the hat and it's oh okay it's on the

601
00:38:24,440 --> 00:38:30,000
edge so it's only Mario's on that Mario pizza peach is a shared nut for Mario

602
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:38,240
and Bowser oh and then bow and Mario is Bowser's Jerry but Bowser's Mario's Tom

603
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:45,800
yeah I can never get Mario unless you lose so it's as if well that's the thing

604
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:49,360
they're both each other's Tom and Jerry's that means Bowser gets Mario

605
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:52,920
because you can only win once and then you move on but you lose so many times

606
00:38:52,920 --> 00:38:56,800
to get to that right Bowser actually is Jerry I think that's a new that's

607
00:38:56,800 --> 00:39:04,240
another area and then when Mario defeats Bowser it's like that video where Tom

608
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:10,280
finally eats yeah and they do a send-off on their own I didn't know you could

609
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:20,120
share a nut you can share a nut or a Jerry or a cheese I mean cuz he shares

610
00:39:20,120 --> 00:39:28,560
the nut and then yes so Tom so Bowser and Mario are like if Tom also wanted

611
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:35,360
cheese. Because cheese is cheese. Because they want each other. Yeah. Yeah. So they both have to.

612
00:39:35,360 --> 00:39:42,960
No, you know, maybe they're both, maybe, hmm, maybe they're both like Spike. Or no, you know what?

613
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:47,840
You know what they are? Bowser has Spikes. No, I got this, dude, I got this. Bowser and Mario are

614
00:39:47,840 --> 00:39:53,840
the alley cats from Tom and Jerry, because those cats hate both Tom and Jerry. Bowser, wait, Bowser

615
00:39:53,840 --> 00:39:57,720
Bowser Mario they both love peach yeah that's like the opposite of hey they

616
00:39:57,720 --> 00:40:16,960
love one things of hating two things well then peach is milk yeah that's true

617
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:21,400
cuz milk is their nut cheese yeah I think Bowser is spike because he has

618
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:27,640
spikes yeah that's easy Bowser and Mario and peach or Tom and Jerry no yeah well

619
00:40:27,640 --> 00:40:31,680
Jerry well it depends on the mushroom is a nut so who are the Goombas and the

620
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:37,120
Koopas the coins are coins those are the alley cats yeah the Goombas and Koopas

621
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:41,000
those are the alley cats and the Goombas are the cheese what are we

622
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:47,960
doing is no way is who's the girl who's the the the girl cat Daisy the sexy girl

623
00:40:47,960 --> 00:40:49,960
cat that Tom likes.

624
00:40:49,960 --> 00:40:50,960
Peach.

625
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:51,960
Oh no because Jerry is...

626
00:40:51,960 --> 00:40:53,960
Her name is also Princess Peach.

627
00:40:53,960 --> 00:40:54,960
Tom's girlfriend is Tom.

628
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:56,960
But Jerry doesn't like that cat.

629
00:40:56,960 --> 00:40:57,960
Oh right.

630
00:40:57,960 --> 00:40:58,960
He doesn't?

631
00:40:58,960 --> 00:40:59,960
It's like his normal.

632
00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:00,960
No you're thinking of normal.

633
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:01,960
I think Jerry does like that cat.

634
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:03,960
No, well Jerry's not like in love with that cat.

635
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:04,960
Wait.

636
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:05,960

Yeah Tom loves that cat.

638

Jerry doesn't really care I don't think.

639
00:41:07,960 --> 00:41:09,960
Oh Jerry doesn't even know that cat.

640
00:41:09,960 --> 00:41:10,960
Garfield is a...

641
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:13,960
Garfield is a scratch.

642
00:41:13,960 --> 00:41:14,960

650
00:41:52,920 --> 00:41:57,760
depressed duck that's like, "I'm going to kill myself!" What is he, where does he fit in?

651
00:41:57,760 --> 00:42:03,120
Wait, that's not from Garfield, is it? That's Tom and Jerry. Oh, right. And then the French

652
00:42:03,120 --> 00:42:07,000
Cousin is normal. I thought you were asking, "Who is the bird in Garfield who wants to kill himself?"

653
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:15,880
No. That bird... Who is he? In which world? Tom and Jerry. Oh, in Tom and Jerry he's...

654
00:42:15,880 --> 00:42:20,280
John being Tom works perfectly because he's in love with that vet who is the

655
00:42:20,280 --> 00:42:28,880
girl cat. Jennifer Love Hewitt. Who Garfield slash Jerry doesn't know. But

667
00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:38,720
Scratay. Shaggy has to be Scratay. The monsters are ice. And they're Anunnaki and

668
00:43:38,720 --> 00:43:43,760
Scooby-Doo as well. They are in that one. Scooby-Doo isn't Anunnaki. He is a

669
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:49,640
Scrat. Yeah. Scooby is a Scrat. He's not a dog. And then there's obviously a Scrat.

670
00:43:49,640 --> 00:43:51,460
He's like way too

671
00:43:51,460 --> 00:43:59,440

He's a popcorn nut yeah

675
00:44:08,680 --> 00:44:14,440
That that's the only way it'll work for scrappy. I'm thinking about could you think we can map this to spongebob?

676
00:44:14,440 --> 00:44:17,320
I think it's fun. I think that's squidward

677
00:44:17,840 --> 00:44:20,580
I'm pretty confident. We have a pretty much 100% success rate.

678
00:44:20,580 --> 00:44:21,940
Yeah, these are like one in one.

679
00:44:21,940 --> 00:44:23,940
SpongeBob is...

680
00:44:23,940 --> 00:44:25,140
SpongeBob is like the mom.

681
00:44:25,140 --> 00:44:26,740
SpongeBob is Sid the Sloth.

682
00:44:26,740 --> 00:44:28,740
No, SpongeBob is Squidward's Nut.

683
00:44:28,740 --> 00:44:29,640

Yeah.

686
00:44:32,440 --> 00:44:35,640
And then Squidward's Nut is the Clarinet.

687
00:44:35,640 --> 00:44:36,440
Or Art.

688
00:44:36,440 --> 00:44:38,440
Squidward's Nut is having a normal day.

689
00:44:38,440 --> 00:44:38,940
Yeah.

690
00:44:38,940 --> 00:44:40,640
Squidward's Nut is dead SpongeBob.

691
00:44:40,640 --> 00:44:42,140

Well, and his nut is is is a guy.

00:47:01,340 --> 00:47:07,340
Here's an interesting world, but so so so one snape snape is a guy who

720
00:47:07,340 --> 00:47:11,740
seems like ice, but he turns out to be a snake.

721
00:47:11,740 --> 00:47:12,740
A sherry.

722
00:47:12,740 --> 00:47:14,540
Oh, he's a he's ice.

723
00:47:14,540 --> 00:47:16,840
Yeah, turn out to be Jerry.

724
00:47:16,840 --> 00:47:20,240
Jerry frozen and ice like this thing ice, but he's Jerry.

725
00:47:20,240 --> 00:47:27,840
ice next episode stay best Jerry uh-huh all right Kramer is scrat yes and he's

726
00:47:27,840 --> 00:47:43,040
not walking into Jerry's room he does it too much towards the and Jerry is Jerry

727
00:47:43,040 --> 00:47:57,820
Jerry and Thomas George yeah okay George is not Garfield George's Garfield is

728
00:47:57,820 --> 00:48:08,180
women dating women and George's lasagna George's lasagna is still is something

729
00:48:08,180 --> 00:48:11,260
that you think is funny

730
00:48:11,260 --> 00:48:21,860
Santa a scrat a tom or a Jerry Santa's a saint is the same well Santa think about

731
00:48:21,860 --> 00:48:26,500
Santa's relationship with I know the Grinch is scrat Christmas being granted

732
00:48:26,500 --> 00:48:32,740
is an anti-Skrat. No, he, no, because he wants no Christmas. Skrat is no nut. Skrat doesn't want no nut.

733
00:48:32,740 --> 00:48:37,620
Well, but if he was a Grinch, he would. Exactly. He's anti-Skrat. I think a Grinch is anti-Skrat.

734
00:48:37,620 --> 00:48:44,980
You know why? Because the Skratzons don't want nuts. Yep. Well, yeah. And they're green. So

735
00:48:44,980 --> 00:48:49,060
they're the Grinch. There are different Christmas rules because anyone... This is a season of Joey.

736
00:48:49,060 --> 00:48:54,020
Christmas always has someone who hates Christmas, which is like kind of different than, I guess...

737
00:48:55,300 --> 00:49:02,380
He hates the ice age. Yeah, that's right. So what is Scrat's humbug? Grinch likes the ice because he lives on a mountain.

738
00:49:02,380 --> 00:49:04,380
But Scrat doesn't.

739
00:49:04,380 --> 00:49:06,380
But what is Grinch's nut?

740
00:49:06,380 --> 00:49:08,380
His nut can't be no-grassy.

741
00:49:08,380 --> 00:49:10,380
His nut is Sitty Lou.

742
00:49:10,380 --> 00:49:12,380
He wants to eat her.

743
00:49:12,380 --> 00:49:14,380
Well he's an anti-Scrat who becomes a Scrat.

744
00:49:14,380 --> 00:49:16,380
Yes.

745
00:49:16,380 --> 00:49:18,380
Yeah, I'll give you that.

746
00:49:18,380 --> 00:49:20,380
Wouldn't an anti-Scrat be a Scratazon?

747
00:49:20,380 --> 00:49:22,380
Yeah, but there's

748
00:49:22,380 --> 00:49:26,380
No, because there's a middle ground, because a Scratazon doesn't want anything.

749
00:49:26,380 --> 00:49:28,380
But an Anti-Scrat wants nothing.

750
00:49:28,380 --> 00:49:30,380
Oh no, the Scratazon is Horton.

751
00:49:30,380 --> 00:49:32,380
Oh, okay.

752
00:49:32,380 --> 00:49:36,380
Because he goes to the... they find a little Scrat, because Scrat is small.

753
00:49:36,380 --> 00:49:38,380
Scrat is a who.

754
00:49:38,380 --> 00:49:40,380
Exactly.

755
00:49:40,380 --> 00:49:43,380
And that's why the Grinch is an Anti-Scrat, because the Grinch hates the who's, who are the Scrats.

756
00:49:43,380 --> 00:49:45,380
What if the Grinch is a glum?

757
00:49:45,380 --> 00:49:47,380
Cameron is squeezing my leg really hard right now.

758
00:49:50,380 --> 00:49:55,660
Grinch is a Scrat. He's an anti-Scrat. No, like he, that's like an evolved form of a

759
00:49:55,660 --> 00:50:00,280
Scrat. Oh, you think like he literally comes from Scrat? Because he lives on an ice

760
00:50:00,280 --> 00:50:05,740
mountain. And he's green. Yeah. And he wants... Isn't he from a neighboring town? He's from a

761
00:50:05,740 --> 00:50:09,900
neighboring mountain. That all has Grinch- or Scrats or Grinches? No, he flew

762
00:50:09,900 --> 00:50:16,900
down

763
00:50:16,900 --> 00:50:20,140
but it may not have

764
00:50:20,140 --> 00:50:23,140
scratch

765
00:50:23,140 --> 00:50:28,140
is wrong with you do you think it

766
00:50:28,140 --> 00:50:28,860
who built

767
00:50:28,860 --> 00:50:32,540
it got dogs

768
00:50:32,540 --> 00:50:33,580
that that the

769
00:50:33,580 --> 00:50:35,500
the greatest a scrap it could work

770
00:50:35,500 --> 00:50:39,500
no it's just read as we come to town with their own strategy

771
00:50:39,500 --> 00:50:44,140
i met where they're all gringes at slash you know i think they could be a

772
00:50:44,140 --> 00:50:48,660
different from a time where they're all no issues he's a mutated who

773
00:50:48,660 --> 00:50:53,420
i know i did not lose track of the perfect line for the beginning of this

774
00:50:53,420 --> 00:50:57,620
conversation it's i've kept all the logic in my head out of line is more of a

775
00:50:57,620 --> 00:50:58,980
family tree

776
00:50:58,980 --> 00:51:00,660
yeah yeah

777
00:51:00,660 --> 00:51:02,700
the rat

778
00:51:02,700 --> 00:51:04,700
scratch not is a rat

779
00:51:04,700 --> 00:51:06,700
wait is a squirrel rat?

780
00:51:06,700 --> 00:51:08,700
a rat

781
00:51:08,700 --> 00:51:10,700
a squirrel, wait, Jerry's a mouse

782
00:51:10,700 --> 00:51:12,700
Jerry's a rat

783
00:51:12,700 --> 00:51:14,700
he's a mouse

784
00:51:14,700 --> 00:51:16,700
he's a rodent

785
00:51:16,700 --> 00:51:18,700
and his nut is cheese

786
00:51:18,700 --> 00:51:20,700
and his graté is as well

787
00:51:20,700 --> 00:51:22,700
that's how you can tell a scrat is more of a squirrel

788
00:51:22,700 --> 00:51:24,700
than a rat, because his nut is a nut instead of cheese

789
00:51:24,700 --> 00:51:26,700
ok but who is the ice's

790
00:51:26,700 --> 00:51:28,700
girlfriend?

791
00:51:28,700 --> 00:51:30,700
ice doesn't need a girlfriend

792
00:51:30,700 --> 00:51:37,820
it's the popcorn no no I see his girlfriend is is rocks yeah because

793
00:51:37,820 --> 00:51:41,940
they're both because rocks are meteors that scrat sent towards the planet the

794
00:51:41,940 --> 00:51:45,220
ice planet and he was helping the Atlanteans because they come from earth

795
00:51:45,220 --> 00:51:51,380
but the scrat Lanteans scrat Lanteans Atlanta like this they're the same

796
00:51:51,380 --> 00:51:54,740
they're similar but there's there's a lot of differences it was that we're at

797
00:51:54,740 --> 00:51:59,580
Lanteans where they were they scrat Lanteans they were the edges who hated

798
00:51:59,580 --> 00:52:05,880
hated land. Yeah, their mountain was the ocean and then one day they and their

799
00:52:05,880 --> 00:52:10,540
Christmas was also the ocean. No, they hated the earth and then one day that

800
00:52:10,540 --> 00:52:15,300
they or they hated water and then one day they had a Grinch style switch.

801
00:52:15,300 --> 00:52:21,360
Maybe, maybe an well, Scrat pulled the plug on Scratlantis. Maybe an at pulled

802
00:52:21,360 --> 00:52:29,080
the plug on Atlantis. Oh my God, right at the Apple Eve's app. Yeah, yeah, she

803
00:52:29,100 --> 00:52:35,640

drained sin mm-hmm and the snake yep is a dinosaur

805
00:52:43,320 --> 00:52:51,120

00:52:52,320 --> 00:53:00,720
what's it that's a dog's nut dog food tail food is always is burying it just

808
00:53:08,280 --> 00:53:17,040
cat nut well we've already established what a cat's nut is it's a mouse yeah

809
00:53:17,040 --> 00:53:18,260
- A cat's nut is a mouse.

810
00:53:18,260 --> 00:53:20,400
- A cat's nut, to be fair, is a clever mouse.

811
00:53:20,400 --> 00:53:21,240
- Yeah.

812
00:53:21,240 --> 00:53:22,740
- A regular mouse is a cheese.

813
00:53:22,740 --> 00:53:24,440
- A regular mouse is a scrate,

814
00:53:24,440 --> 00:53:26,360
which is something that it gets.

815
00:53:26,360 --> 00:53:28,620
The nut is what it doesn't get until the end,

816
00:53:28,620 --> 00:53:30,580
and the scrate, oh, it gets.

817
00:53:30,580 --> 00:53:32,540
Oh, it gets.

818
00:53:32,540 --> 00:53:33,360
- One day it gets.

819
00:53:33,360 --> 00:53:34,200
- Yeah.

820
00:53:34,200 --> 00:53:35,040
- And then a dog is its dog.

821
00:53:35,040 --> 00:53:37,820
- Borat's nut is America.

822
00:53:37,820 --> 00:53:39,620
- No, Borat's nut is wife.

823
00:53:39,620 --> 00:53:40,680
- It's Pamela Anderson.

824
00:53:40,680 --> 00:53:41,520
- Yeah.

825
00:53:41,520 --> 00:53:44,760
- Borat's wife is, Borat's nut is Pamela Anderson.

826
00:53:44,760 --> 00:53:46,620
- Yeah, so it's actually a clever

827
00:53:46,620 --> 00:53:52,860
version of the nuts grant a formula wait his America is his ice yeah I guess it

It's no,

857
00:56:04,860 --> 00:56:06,420
it's an entity that is the

858
00:56:06,420 --> 00:56:07,940
mountain right now.

859
00:56:07,940 --> 00:56:09,860
And I think earth is yeah,

860
00:56:09,860 --> 00:56:11,980
I'm is hog time is magic.

861
00:56:11,980 --> 00:56:13,860
You said that yeah,

862
00:56:13,860 --> 00:56:14,340
I know,

863
00:56:14,340 --> 00:56:15,700
but I'm repeating because it's

864
00:56:15,700 --> 00:56:16,100
true.

865
00:56:16,100 --> 00:56:16,980
That's a good point.

866
00:56:16,980 --> 00:56:17,820
Yeah,

867
00:56:17,820 --> 00:56:18,540
yeah,

868
00:56:18,540 --> 00:56:20,180
I think we figured it out.

869
00:56:20,180 --> 00:56:20,700
Yeah,

870
00:56:20,700 --> 00:56:20,940
well,

871
00:56:20,940 --> 00:56:22,180
we got you as godzilla's not.

872
00:56:22,180 --> 00:56:22,780
If that's what you're about,

873
00:56:22,780 --> 00:56:23,100
yeah,

874
00:56:23,100 --> 00:56:23,540
yeah,

875
00:56:23,540 --> 00:56:23,940
yeah,

876
00:56:23,940 --> 00:56:24,300
okay,

877
00:56:24,300 --> 00:56:32,100
Tokyo yeah well the oceans more of his hog war yeah and then Tokyo is the lost

878
00:56:32,100 --> 00:56:37,380
world with the dinosaurs uh-huh the big dinosaurs that he's I use Godzilla's

879
00:56:37,380 --> 00:56:42,500

881
00:56:47,340 --> 00:56:51,980
Jerry eats his cheese he becomes shaped like the cheese that's true yeah I've

882
00:56:51,980 --> 00:56:57,220
seen that what's Patrick's not skateboarding maybe maybe that might be

883
00:56:57,220 --> 00:57:07,740
the thing that you like doing yeah the nut is the thing that you get when your

884
00:57:07,740 --> 00:57:11,580
animation studio decides they want to end you on their own terms my nut is

885
00:57:11,580 --> 00:57:19,420
hair yeah yeah my nut is 1 trillion dollars yeah I think that might be mine

886
00:57:19,420 --> 00:57:21,420
You can't have the same nut.

887
00:57:21,420 --> 00:57:23,420
We're not a Mario and Bowser.

888
00:57:23,420 --> 00:57:25,420
Has anybody had anything to do with nuts except Scratch being a nut?

889
00:57:25,420 --> 00:57:27,420
My nut probably is a real nut.

890
00:57:27,420 --> 00:57:29,420
If it's them wanting to kill me,

891
00:57:29,420 --> 00:57:31,420
If it's a hazelnut.

892
00:57:31,420 --> 00:57:33,420
Are you allergic to a hazelnut?

893
00:57:33,420 --> 00:57:35,420
I'm allergic to a hazelnut.

894
00:57:35,420 --> 00:57:37,420
My nut is eating a swan, I think.

895
00:57:37,420 --> 00:57:39,420
You can do that.

896
00:57:39,420 --> 00:57:41,420
No, it's forbidden.

897
00:57:41,420 --> 00:57:43,420
Well, Scratch can just do that.

898
00:57:43,420 --> 00:57:45,420
Is it illegal or is it forbidden?

899
00:57:45,420 --> 00:57:47,420
It's forbidden.

900
00:57:47,420 --> 00:57:52,500
That's one above illegal. Oh wow. Yeah. But you can't just tell him that you can just

901
00:57:52,500 --> 00:57:55,520
do that because you could say that to Scrat too. Eating a nut would seem to be

902
00:57:55,520 --> 00:57:58,820
the easiest task in all of prehistory. I think maybe Scrat just needed to be told that.

903
00:57:58,820 --> 00:58:02,820
I think Scrat maybe needed to just be like, "Yeah, you can eat a nut." Yeah, he wouldn't be

904
00:58:02,820 --> 00:58:07,820
able to understand you. He doesn't speak English. Yeah, he does speak English.

905
00:58:07,820 --> 00:58:11,460
He understands it. He understands it. Because they said, "Welcome to Scratlantis."

906
00:58:11,460 --> 00:58:16,420
Yeah. He probably thought they were saying, "You can have this nut." Yeah, he probably thought they said, "Nut, nut, nut, nut, nut, nut, nut, nut."

907
00:58:16,420 --> 00:58:20,900
not not not yeah it doesn't matter if yeah he thought there was a you can't or

908
00:58:20,900 --> 00:58:24,020
you can't have this nut you know he was gonna spread out either way they said

909
00:58:24,020 --> 00:58:28,580
you can't have this nut and he just leaves

910
00:58:28,580 --> 00:58:33,860
scream people would walk out of the theater I would walk out of the theater

911
00:58:33,860 --> 00:58:37,460
if they played the end by finale at the start of a movie I would walk out of the

912
00:58:37,460 --> 00:58:41,100
theater before yeah well yeah cuz it says the end at the beginning yeah

913
00:58:41,100 --> 00:58:45,540
obviously so that's never gonna be shown in theaters though cuz no it's an

914
00:58:45,540 --> 00:58:48,500
an independent short on you to we should we should screen it. We

915
00:58:48,500 --> 00:58:48,820
should

916
00:58:48,820 --> 00:58:50,840
be read out

917
00:58:50,840 --> 00:58:52,420
we

918
00:58:52,420 --> 00:58:54,620
three now one minute

919
00:58:54,620 --> 00:58:57,620
getting it and then we do and then we do

920
00:58:57,620 --> 00:59:01,940
two more hours of this talking about the cultural impact.

921
00:59:01,940 --> 00:59:07,900
Talking about who Garfield's not it's such a good idea. I wish we'd

922
00:59:07,900 --> 00:59:09,060
done that instead of this

923
00:59:09,060 --> 00:59:12,740
ten thousand dollars renting out the film for

924
00:59:14,900 --> 00:59:21,380
correct. I'm down. This should be called the panel discussion of finale. Yeah. I

925
00:59:21,380 --> 00:59:25,060
mean I'll do we'll do a second one. We'll just do a live one. Yeah. After screening.

926
00:59:25,060 --> 00:59:30,340
Yeah we're gonna do that. That's gonna happen. On tour which you can get tickets at

927
00:59:30,340 --> 00:59:37,340
swagpoop.com/shows. Pierce will be on the shows. Yup. And we're gonna do this we're

928
00:59:37,340 --> 00:59:41,700
gonna do this in every city. Yeah this is the opening act. Philly. Yeah. This is what

929
00:59:41,700 --> 00:59:48,100
Pierce is going to do. Yeah, I wrote this yesterday morning and we all just read it off the charts.

930
00:59:48,100 --> 00:59:52,180
It does kind of seem like that. Yeah. I'm pretty impressed that we talked about that

931
00:59:52,180 --> 00:59:55,100
for an hour. I really thought. Yeah, I thought that was good. I was just excited to talk

932
00:59:55,100 --> 00:59:58,340
about Scrat for ten minutes at the top. And not only, it was very, it was very. Not only

933
00:59:58,340 --> 01:00:02,900
I could keep going. Definitely, I might want to keep going the next episode we're recording

934
01:00:02,900 --> 01:00:07,020
right after this. Calm down dude. We should think of some more examples. We shouldn't release

935
01:00:07,020 --> 01:00:11,140
the next one where we talk about Scrat after. We should wait like three weeks. Well, that's

936
01:00:11,140 --> 01:00:16,220
the way the schedule is shaking, a very complicated backlog schedule. The one that we record right

937
01:00:16,220 --> 01:00:21,220
after this will come out in like two or three weeks. So look forward to...

938
01:00:21,220 --> 01:00:23,100
So you get a little break.

939
01:00:23,100 --> 01:00:27,820
That's kind of, yeah. It'll be a Scrat Gets Us Not retrospective for you, but not for us.

940
01:00:27,820 --> 01:00:29,980
For us it will be a present-spective.

941
01:00:29,980 --> 01:00:35,660
What you should do is you should put the recording on your computer right now and then we can

942
01:00:35,660 --> 01:00:37,700
listen to it and then make...

943
01:00:37,700 --> 01:00:40,340
We should do a director's commentary of the episode.

944
01:00:40,340 --> 01:00:43,560
We do director's commentary and then add like, we're adding footnotes and it's like, what

945
01:00:43,560 --> 01:00:45,500
we meant here was like this and...

946
01:00:45,500 --> 01:00:48,580
It would be so complicated because we did that already.

947
01:00:48,580 --> 01:00:52,740
We were already doing commentary whether or not...

948
01:00:52,740 --> 01:00:53,740
I think it'll sound good.

949
01:00:53,740 --> 01:00:54,740
Alright.

950
01:00:54,740 --> 01:00:55,740
Bye!

951
01:00:55,740 --> 01:00:56,740
Bye!
