10
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:15,800
- That's the sound I made earlier when I hurt my back

11
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:17,520
and none of you called me.

12
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:19,720
- You didn't tell us that you hurt your back.

13
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:21,240
- He did tell us actually, I just didn't.

14
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:24,120
- I can barely get a full breath in.

15
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:26,040
- You didn't tell us until it happened

16
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:26,880
and we were all busy.

17
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:28,840
- I didn't tell him until it happened.

18
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:31,720
I didn't say before it happened that I hurt my back.

19
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:33,720
That is a fucking amazing point.

20
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:35,040
You should have told me.

21
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:36,040
That is an amazing point.

22
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:38,720
You should have told me before I'm going to hurt my back today.

23
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:41,640
I would not know whether to tell you that or not.

24
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:42,640
Okay, I'm going to hurt my back tomorrow.

25
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:44,400
I'm just going to start telling you that every day.

26
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:47,560
I'm going to pass away.

27
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:48,560

00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:35,900
I don't listen to a word that that scoundrel says.

94
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:36,900
Yeah.

95
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:38,780
Scoundrel's a little heavy of a word for OJ Simpson.

96
00:04:38,780 --> 00:04:40,820
Yeah, I think you need to dial it back.

00:04:40,820 --> 00:04:42,940

00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:40,540
- And it's so haunted. - 'Cause you also use it on a boat.

128
00:06:40,540 --> 00:06:41,940

00:06:41,940 --> 00:06:42,860
Yeah, it's foreboding. - Yeah.

00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:44,180
- It's haunted. - Well, it's, okay.

131
00:06:44,180 --> 00:06:45,020
There's something about a ghost ship--

132
00:06:45,020 --> 00:06:46,300
- It's like you don't wanna go near it.

133
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:48,060
- There's something about a ghost ship

134
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:50,700
that's so hauntingly beautiful.

135
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:51,620
(laughing)

136
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:52,460
- I don't think I agree with you.

137
00:06:52,460 --> 00:06:53,980
- There's something about a haunted painting

138
00:06:53,980 --> 00:06:55,980
that's so hauntingly beautiful.

139
00:06:55,980 --> 00:06:56,820
- Depends on the painting.

140
00:06:56,820 --> 00:06:58,100
There's something so haunted.

141
00:06:58,100 --> 00:07:02,140
There's something about a zombie Mona Lisa that's so decomposingly gorgeous.

142
00:07:02,140 --> 00:07:03,420
There's something so haunted.

143
00:07:03,420 --> 00:07:04,420
Oh my god, dude.

144
00:07:04,420 --> 00:07:08,140
A zombie Mona Lisa would go so fucking hard in 2009.

145
00:07:08,140 --> 00:07:10,300
You could get that in a museum for sure.

146
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:13,860
I think you could get, I'll say, I think you could get any Mona Lisa in a museum.

147
00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:14,860
Nope.

148
00:07:14,860 --> 00:07:15,860
I think that's where they belong.

149
00:07:15,860 --> 00:07:16,860
Listen, listen.

150
00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:17,860
I'm not gonna, listen.

151
00:07:17,860 --> 00:07:19,820
I don't wanna, again, I don't wanna get political.

152
00:07:19,820 --> 00:07:24,380
I don't wanna get divisive about society and about men and women.

153
00:07:24,380 --> 00:07:25,380
Don't even get me started.

154
00:07:25,380 --> 00:07:28,260
Mona Lisa was a man she would not be in the museum.

155
00:07:28,260 --> 00:07:30,420
- You're right, she'd be the president.

156
00:07:30,420 --> 00:07:31,260
Woo hoo!

157
00:07:31,260 --> 00:07:32,100
(laughing)

158
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:32,940
- Yes!

159
00:07:32,940 --> 00:07:34,060
- Yay!

160
00:07:34,060 --> 00:07:36,140
- You think that you could get any Mona Lisa

161
00:07:36,140 --> 00:07:38,460
into a museum, but trust me, it's hard.

162
00:07:38,460 --> 00:07:39,460
- It's hard as fuck.

163
00:07:39,460 --> 00:07:43,740
- I have a lot of Mona Lisas I've done Photoshop to.

164
00:07:43,740 --> 00:07:45,780
- And it's a hell of a lot harder to get them out.

165
00:07:45,780 --> 00:07:46,620
- They don't go in the museum.

166
00:07:46,620 --> 00:07:48,380
- Well, you know the Mona Lisa that's in the museum,

167
00:07:48,380 --> 00:07:50,980
that's like probably the 200th or 300th Mona Lisa.

168
00:07:50,980 --> 00:07:51,820
- I made her--

169
00:07:51,820 --> 00:07:54,860
- The Mr. Bean Mona Lisa was before that one.

170
00:07:54,860 --> 00:08:03,160
I put I made Mona Lisa Latina. I made her do a duck face selfie. I made her do I

171
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:08,160
mean there's one of her and it's modern. Don't tell me that. And this is you ever

172
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:13,880
do a Darth Vader mask? Yep none of them in the MoMA. Yeah. No museum is touching

173
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:17,480
these things. They're going in my MoMA's house. It was my drawing and she puts

174
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:22,520
them all on the fridge. The gift shops. Yeah they go well that does that barely

175
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:26,960
accounts of being in a museum though. I think I might open up the Museum of

176
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:31,960
Mona Lisa. And then maybe all these Mona Lisa, all these different Mona

177
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:35,880
Lisas that aren't making it to the museums could find a home, a forever home.

178
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:39,080
I know that you can't say publicly that you're gonna like assassinate somebody

179
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:43,520
or do something. Going to assassinate Mona Lisa. I'm going to smear cream on Mona Lisa.

180
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:49,160
Can't you publicly say like I'm going to steal the Mona Lisa? Yeah. You can say that and you won't get in trouble.

181
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:54,080
you won't you can say you can say all of that stuff unless it's about a specific

182
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:57,800
person we were talking these days the employees at the Louvre there said it's

183
00:08:57,800 --> 00:09:01,080
if somebody tries to steal the Mona Lisa they're not supposed to stop them really

184
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:05,480
just let them go yeah because it's insured yeah I mean look at last week

185
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:11,920
somebody I haven't looked up this store I would like to get it get a quick update

186
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:17,240
on the Mona Lisa cream stir that cream stir that's what I'm calling I'm what's

187
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:20,760
that's what I'm calling him. Somebody cream pied the Mona Lisa, so they cream

188
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:25,740
of a man cremulated that's a lucky man. Let me see if I can order to

189
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:28,660
eventually by the Mona Lisa, the real Mona Lisa yeah. Why do you think how do

190
00:09:28,660 --> 00:09:33,180
you think she stood so damn still she's so full of fucking come glue. No well

191
00:09:33,180 --> 00:09:38,360
come yeah she's glued to her her chair with come. I was trying to see like I

192
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:41,720
want to know if like this guy went to jail or something the first

193
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:47,380
36 year old man disguised as an elderly woman in a wheelchair tried to smear a

194
00:09:47,380 --> 00:09:50,980
cake-like substance on the Mona Lisa on Sunday in an apparent climate-related

195
00:09:50,980 --> 00:09:54,740
protest at the Louvre in Paris. He has since been referred to a police

196
00:09:54,740 --> 00:10:00,620
psychiatric unit. Whoa, they have police psychiatric units?

197
00:10:00,620 --> 00:10:07,420
A joker interrogated him. Why'd you do it? Why'd you smear the Mona Lisa in cream?

198
00:10:07,420 --> 00:10:12,500
I found a video here I looked up Mona Lisa. Wait, this isn't our suspect. This is just an old woman.

199
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:17,540
I don't know if this is similar. I looked up Mona Lisa cream pie and I saw a video

200
00:10:17,540 --> 00:10:24,860
Mona Lisa gets all three holes filled. Holy shit. Oh my god. Did you guys know

201
00:10:24,860 --> 00:10:28,540
Mona Lisa has actually been attacked several times not just by cream. Really?

202
00:10:28,540 --> 00:10:34,780
What's one of the other horrifying incidents? 1956 two separate incidents in

203
00:10:34,780 --> 00:10:43,300
1956 Holy Shit Acid Whoa that's way more more than cream and a rock a whole

204
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:45,820
rock a rock a rock

205
00:10:45,820 --> 00:10:47,540
is

206
00:10:47,540 --> 00:10:52,580
a plan. You're like I'm going to van vandalize the Mona Lisa this year. I'm

207
00:10:52,580 --> 00:10:55,180
going to I'm going to do it. Here's my plan. I'm going to hit it with a rock

208
00:10:55,180 --> 00:10:57,660
and then the right before you do it. Some God throws

209
00:11:01,140 --> 00:11:08,340
throw the rock. The rock's already in my hand. I already have. I already bought the rock.

210
00:11:08,340 --> 00:11:13,100
You could also play that off as like, look I slipped I was trying to throw a rock at

211
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:19,660
the guy throwing the acid. I was playing rock and I missed. The goal. 2009 the Mona Lisa

212
00:11:19,660 --> 00:11:25,420
was attacked with a ceramic cup. Whoa. Attacked is a strong word. It says attacked. You can't

213
00:11:25,420 --> 00:11:30,060
can attack as a woman attacked it with the ceramic cup. She did she was not

214
00:11:30,060 --> 00:11:34,120
doing that. I do think when I was at a museum, I was at the gardener when we

215
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:38,900
were in Boston and I you can just touch paintings. You're not supposed to. You

216
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:42,460
can't yeah, they'll walk over but like they want you to touch him like there's

217
00:11:42,460 --> 00:11:46,840
not you get oils from your fingers could degrade to but like why would you not

218
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:50,980
put every painting in a with a yeah, why is it only like the Mona Lisa just put

219
00:11:50,980 --> 00:11:54,520
it in like a giant black box? Yeah, I don't you shouldn't be able to get so

220
00:11:54,540 --> 00:11:58,060
close to them. That's what I think that hey, that's just Caleb's two cents in

221
00:11:58,060 --> 00:12:02,380
Caleb's corner of this week. He then proceeds to smear cream on the glass and

222
00:12:02,380 --> 00:12:07,060
throws roses everywhere before being tackled by security on the class. He

223
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:11,500
threw roses. This guy should be in jail. I'm obsessed with this guy. Someone

224
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:13,300
smashed a cake on Mona Lisa.

225
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:19,700
And that's not as good as smeared cream. This guy's is an elderly woman. I

226
00:12:19,700 --> 00:12:20,620
smeared cream

227
00:12:22,980 --> 00:12:25,460
left unharmed but smeared in cream.

228
00:12:25,460 --> 00:12:27,820
(laughing)

229
00:12:27,820 --> 00:12:30,160
- I'm also seeing here,

230
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:33,320
she also, she gets all three of her holes filled.

231
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:35,180
- We, with cream?

232
00:12:35,180 --> 00:12:36,020
- Yeah.

233
00:12:36,020 --> 00:12:37,580
- Yeah, we already talked about that.

234
00:12:37,580 --> 00:12:38,420
He creamed her.

235
00:12:38,420 --> 00:12:39,400
- It looks like she's gonna have

236
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:41,740
a difficult time walking after this.

237
00:12:41,740 --> 00:12:43,260
- Oh really?

238
00:12:43,260 --> 00:12:45,060
You know, I think that's a myth.

239
00:12:45,060 --> 00:12:46,780
I don't think any women have had sex

240
00:12:46,780 --> 00:12:48,920
so good that they can't walk.

241
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:50,340
- They probably already couldn't walk.

242
00:12:50,340 --> 00:12:52,340
- Yeah, exactly.

243
00:12:52,340 --> 00:12:57,380
Yeah, maybe you pulled a muscle, but it wasn't any wasn't the guy's fault. I

244
00:12:57,380 --> 00:13:02,780
know that much. Yeah, I don't think any man has ever done that. No, nobody and

245
00:13:02,780 --> 00:13:07,260
also nobody has a big a big penis either. No, nobody has and if they do they

246
00:13:07,260 --> 00:13:11,260
should be in the circus. Yeah, you're a freak. You basically are close to close

247
00:13:11,260 --> 00:13:16,140
to an elephant than a human. Okay, I promise this is the last one I'm gonna

248
00:13:16,140 --> 00:13:21,020
read. Okay, but here's a line from the Al Jazeera article. I trust Al Jazeera.

249
00:13:21,380 --> 00:13:25,160
The cake attack left a conspicuous white creamy smear

250
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:32,600
on what but the famous work by Leonardo da Vinci was not damaged. Oh my God,

251
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:36,060
the cake attack left a conspicuous white creamy. So you guys know about

252
00:13:36,060 --> 00:13:40,880
that painting that is supposedly like a da Vinci painting of Jesus or something

253
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:44,140
and but it's not really but like a some

254
00:13:44,140 --> 00:13:50,560
fucking what's his name the prince of of no, I don't the Saudi Prince guy. He

255
00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:54,100
bought it for like 400 million dollars. It's just a fake painting. That's pretty cool.

256
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:58,100
Yeah, I mean, have you seen this? It doesn't really... That's just two balls hanging out

257
00:13:58,100 --> 00:14:04,420
of a fat guy's poofer. I think that's not Da Vinci. That is the furthest thing from

258
00:14:04,420 --> 00:14:08,780
Da Vinci. Yeah, absolutely not Da Vinci. I showed this to Cameron earlier, but I didn't

259
00:14:08,780 --> 00:14:13,380
notice that his penis is inside of his fat fold. Oh, I see balls and no dick. I thought

260
00:14:13,380 --> 00:14:16,420
it was a balls no dick guy, because I know that exists. And guys who just pee out of

261
00:14:16,420 --> 00:14:17,660
- Nolo. - Nolo?

262
00:14:17,660 --> 00:14:18,500
- That's what it is. - Nolo.

263
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:19,980
- They're calling them Nolos. - It's called Nolos.

264
00:14:19,980 --> 00:14:21,100
- It might be Nolos. - They're called Nolos.

265
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:23,300
They get their penises surgically removed.

266
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:24,140
- There's just a little, just a little.

267
00:14:24,140 --> 00:14:26,580
- A little hole. - A little dot.

268
00:14:26,580 --> 00:14:28,700
A dot for them to pee from.

269
00:14:28,700 --> 00:14:29,700
- They pee from a dot?

270
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:30,980
- Yeah. - They pee from a dot

271
00:14:30,980 --> 00:14:31,820
on their body.

272
00:14:31,820 --> 00:14:33,380
- That's actually sick. - Folks, they pee from a dot.

273
00:14:33,380 --> 00:14:34,220
- Folks. - They pee from one little dot.

274
00:14:34,220 --> 00:14:36,100
- They don't want you to pee from a dot.

275
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:37,220
- I don't know. - They want you

276
00:14:37,220 --> 00:14:40,060
to get rid of your penis and just leave a dot.

277
00:14:40,060 --> 00:14:40,900
- It's unbelievable.

278
00:14:40,900 --> 00:14:42,900
If I had a dot, I'd probably have four dots.

279
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:44,900
[laughter]

280
00:14:44,900 --> 00:14:46,900
I'd have four little dots.

281
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:48,900
I'd probably have four or five dots, I don't know.

282
00:14:48,900 --> 00:14:50,900
Four little dots over the unit square.

283
00:14:50,900 --> 00:14:55,900
They're saying I have the most dots of any NOLO.

284
00:14:55,900 --> 00:14:58,900
Guys, I think it's been three weeks. I think I'll never stop doing this voice.

285
00:14:58,900 --> 00:15:00,900
It won't stop.

286
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:02,900
I think I ruined my life.

287
00:15:02,900 --> 00:15:04,900
I think it's gonna keep happening.

288
00:15:04,900 --> 00:15:07,900
There was a point where we kept talking about serious things in this voice.

289
00:15:07,900 --> 00:15:09,900
It was so funny to me.

290
00:15:09,900 --> 00:15:14,660
So funny, but it was very cathartic. It was very weird. I don't like that word. Don't ever

291
00:15:14,660 --> 00:15:18,620
Say that again he broke

292
00:15:18,620 --> 00:15:23,180
Nope, a bee flew flew a bee went into the studio and in

293
00:15:23,180 --> 00:15:28,980
B was in here get that be out of here get that to be out of here get that be out of here

294
00:15:28,980 --> 00:15:33,420
We don't like we don't like that. No, I like the bees buzzing. He's yellow and black. It's beautiful

295
00:15:33,420 --> 00:15:36,500
Actually, I was only joking you get the beer

296
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:42,060
you can collapse the colony. Everybody go on YouTube right now type in

297
00:15:42,060 --> 00:15:46,620
Donald Trump get that baby out of here. That's the best Trump video that

298
00:15:46,620 --> 00:15:51,220
nobody talks about. Honestly going forward that's like required

299
00:15:51,220 --> 00:15:54,940
viewing for this to make any sense. I think so yeah. I think that's the key.

300
00:15:54,940 --> 00:15:58,860
It's a founding text. That's the video that we watched on tour that mutated our

301
00:15:58,860 --> 00:16:04,020
brains forever. Well the first one I think in terms of Trump video top

302
00:16:04,020 --> 00:16:07,940
Number one is get the baby out of here. Number two is Obama chewing gum.

303
00:16:07,940 --> 00:16:11,540
Yeah, and then turn the lights off. Those are the top. I wouldn't put them in any order,

304
00:16:11,540 --> 00:16:16,580
but those are my top three. I'm going to have to go with the get the baby out of here,

305
00:16:16,580 --> 00:16:20,340
turn the lights off. I would say I'm going to probably have to go with this time the pee tape.

306
00:16:20,340 --> 00:16:26,980
Nah. Nah, nah, nah. Actually, somebody showed it to me. My favorite footage is him leaving the

307
00:16:26,980 --> 00:16:32,180
White House on January 20th. And him actually leaving the White House on January 6th was

308
00:16:32,180 --> 00:16:35,220
actually very cathartic. Do you guys remember when he looked at the eclipse?

309
00:16:35,220 --> 00:16:40,420
Yeah. And he took, they gave everyone special glasses to look at the eclipse and he took his off.

310
00:16:40,420 --> 00:16:45,260
And like, it's just like so fucking sick. I've been smoking weed again and watching every single Trump video.

311
00:16:45,260 --> 00:16:50,300
I took an edible when I was back at home. What's wrong with us? The worst thing I've ever done.

312
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:56,860
It was the, literally I took that and then I re-evaluated a lot of things in my

313
00:16:56,860 --> 00:16:58,860
life and I think I can no longer do the show.

314
00:16:58,860 --> 00:17:00,860
Whoa! That's dope!

315
00:17:00,860 --> 00:17:02,860
That's huge!

316
00:17:02,860 --> 00:17:04,860
That's great for you! I'm happy for you!

317
00:17:04,860 --> 00:17:06,860
I smoked so much weed that I thought that there was maybe

318
00:17:06,860 --> 00:17:08,860
or I was told there was a ghost in my house

319
00:17:08,860 --> 00:17:10,860
and then I was up looking

320
00:17:10,860 --> 00:17:12,860
for the ghost. I got really

321
00:17:12,860 --> 00:17:14,860
really really scared and then I laid down and I

322
00:17:14,860 --> 00:17:16,860
kind of started

323
00:17:16,860 --> 00:17:18,860
feeling more like a video game character and then

324
00:17:18,860 --> 00:17:20,860
I was able to go to sleep. I tried to learn

325
00:17:20,860 --> 00:17:22,860
chess. I smoked too little weed and I

326
00:17:22,860 --> 00:17:24,860
read a thousand books and became a genius.

327
00:17:24,860 --> 00:17:35,860
I took half of an edible, she had these little fruit gummies, I took half of it and I was like, I don't feel anything.

328
00:17:35,860 --> 00:17:36,860
And then...

329
00:17:36,860 --> 00:17:38,860
Story as old as time!

330
00:17:38,860 --> 00:17:42,860
I don't... dude, stop right there, I know what's coming next.

331
00:17:42,860 --> 00:17:45,860
I am fucking high as hell!

332
00:17:45,860 --> 00:17:50,860
I am crazy, I am from my edible!

333
00:17:50,860 --> 00:17:52,860

340
00:18:23,380 --> 00:18:25,940
So I am very scared

341
00:18:25,940 --> 00:18:32,760
You're grabbing some go whoa, what's this? Oh my god. Yeah when the edible hits too hard and you're scared

342
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:38,900
Mm-hmm, well, it's too hard and you start thinking everything's a slice of pizza. Yeah, damn that shit is bullshit

343
00:18:38,900 --> 00:18:40,900
I looked at my computer

344
00:18:40,900 --> 00:18:44,540
When I was growing up weed was bullshit weed was

345
00:18:45,540 --> 00:18:50,120
I mean when I was when I I don't know about you guys when I was growing up weed was something

346
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:52,880
I had to get rid of in the yard with the damn push mower now

347
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:58,680
It's something that's what I'm after I'm thinking it ain't shit. Mm-hmm. What the hell is going fucking on these days?

348
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:03,980
What the heck are they putting in weed? Seriously? I look at I go into the tree. I see a blue

349
00:19:03,980 --> 00:19:10,060
Strain I say what the heff. Mm-hmm. Wait, they got a fucking yellow green. Now. It's the problem. No

350
00:19:10,060 --> 00:19:14,380
Putting purple in it

351
00:19:14,380 --> 00:19:16,460
- I mean, they're making jelly beans.

352
00:19:16,460 --> 00:19:19,780
- So we used to smoke as kids, that shit was black.

353
00:19:19,780 --> 00:19:20,620
- Yep.

354
00:19:20,620 --> 00:19:21,460
- Black as night.

355
00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:22,300
- It was black and you would get it--

356
00:19:22,300 --> 00:19:23,500
- And it came in a pill.

357
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:24,340
- Yeah.

358
00:19:24,340 --> 00:19:25,160
- Yep.

359
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:26,000
- You'd get it in a pill and it--

360
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,420
- And it was called Sex with a Grudge.

361
00:19:28,420 --> 00:19:29,420
- And it smelled.

362
00:19:29,420 --> 00:19:30,260
- Yep, it smelled.

363
00:19:30,260 --> 00:19:31,080
- Oh, it's so bad.

364
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:31,920
- It wasn't even really a pill.

365
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:33,420
- It smelled groovy.

366
00:19:33,420 --> 00:19:35,300
- It smelled like mint.

367
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:37,180
But it was like potent mint.

368
00:19:37,180 --> 00:19:38,860
- And I mean, we would smoke that shit

369
00:19:38,860 --> 00:19:42,660
and we would just be doing wheelies on our Razor scooters.

370
00:19:42,660 --> 00:19:44,540
- And then one of us has the crazy idea,

371
00:19:44,540 --> 00:19:46,940
like I'm gonna put baseball cards in my spokes.

372
00:19:46,940 --> 00:19:49,380
- Damn, and one homie hit the rip stick.

373
00:19:49,380 --> 00:19:50,220
- Mm-hmm.

374
00:19:50,220 --> 00:19:51,040
- Yep.

375
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:52,160
- We used to smoke weed and then just do

376
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:54,460
the family guy vomit in my living room.

377
00:19:54,460 --> 00:19:56,740
- One guy hits the rip stick and he's going--

378
00:19:56,740 --> 00:19:58,860
- Oh my God, he goes down the hill to--

379
00:19:58,860 --> 00:20:00,860
- What is he, he's training for snowboarding?

380
00:20:00,860 --> 00:20:02,780
- He's going too fast on the rip stick.

381
00:20:02,780 --> 00:20:05,340
- I used to fucking destroy rip stick, dude.

382
00:20:05,340 --> 00:20:06,460
I hated them.

383
00:20:06,460 --> 00:20:07,300
- I could go super speed.

384
00:20:07,300 --> 00:20:08,140
- I was too scared to go on the rip stick.

385
00:20:08,140 --> 00:20:09,740
- I'm good at them now, but I couldn't do them then.

386
00:20:09,740 --> 00:20:11,180
- They're fun, dude.

387
00:20:11,180 --> 00:20:12,020
- Yeah.

388
00:20:12,020 --> 00:20:16,240

442
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:53,880

443
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:57,560
doesn't make any sense. How did you get this scar? Can you explain this?

444
00:22:57,560 --> 00:22:58,600
Oh yeah, he was jumping.

445
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:05,080
He has a giant, disgusting arm scar that looks like you got like liposuction on one arm.

446
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:16,360
So we went to a wedding this weekend and they had a trampoline with a basketball hoop,

447
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:22,440
but it was an in-ground trampoline, so it was probably like six feet deep that they dug so

448
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:28,040
so you could get really high jumps and I fucked up the jump really bad here. I

449
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:32,520
don't have a video of him getting of him getting cut, but a video I took like

450
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:36,920
after where you can just see the giant all the blood on his arm. That's so

451
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:41,640
funny. Okay, so there's like the camera wouldn't focus. Okay, there's like dust

452
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:43,040
in front of it. Look at this.

453
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:48,840
Oh my God. Yeah. Did you know that you had gotten scraped? No, so you didn't.

454
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:53,400
So you so carefree I didn't notice it dude. I was my God. Yeah, I did not

455
00:23:53,400 --> 00:24:00,920
notice it till he like he's so I it's a crazy video. So I jumped and I

456
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:05,120
there's blood fucking I had the basketball in my hand because I was like

457
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:06,940
the way I was pretty drunk and I was like

458
00:24:06,940 --> 00:24:14,240
tonight's the night I dunk for the first time. Yep, and I jumped but I

459
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:18,280
I think I timed it wrong and I fell into the hoop.

460
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:20,080
- Yeah, I did a similar thing.

461
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:22,040
- Oh, I have a really good video of you doing that.

462
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:23,600
- There's a very good video, Caleb.

463
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:26,000
- Yeah, that trampoline was kind of a death trap.

464
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,120
I hurt my toe pretty bad on that.

465
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:29,880
- There shouldn't be any, weddings need to--

466
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:32,520
- The owner of that house looked at me and said,

467
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:36,080
I put, four kids lived at this house,

468
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:37,200
they all went through college

469
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:39,680
without a single trampoline accident.

470
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:40,520
- They sound like fucking losers.

471
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:42,720
- I should've said, your kids are pussies.

472
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:47,160
they were not going on. Yeah, they probably never try to back. That was

473
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:51,920
the thing. It was like it was like a an in ground trampoline. It was like

474
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:55,260
there who kept it was going crazy with the back flips. They were so yeah,

475
00:24:55,260 --> 00:24:59,520
that was nuts. It was front flips, but it was it was not so crazy flip on

476
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:03,120
a because it's flush with the ground. Yeah, it's ground level and there's

477
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:07,040
like a pit under it and there's like gap. There's like gaps. Yeah, right

478
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:09,560
when you get to the hoop, there's gaps. There's gaps on all sides. So

479
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:12,820
So people were like somebody, I think, dropped their phone or something down in

480
00:25:12,820 --> 00:25:16,000
there, too, and they were like trying to find it, but like it's literally yeah.

481
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:16,620
If you jump

482
00:25:16,620 --> 00:25:21,720
to the side by accident a little bit, you will your leg will go down to a pit.

483
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:25,040
You shouldn't there should not be activities at a wedding. This is this was

484
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:28,920
just because I guess it was at the venue already, but there should you shouldn't

00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:28,780
that'd be really funny

520
00:27:28,780 --> 00:27:32,420
it'd be super funny if there was a uh... an actual sponge named spongebob that wore

521

531
00:28:22,860 --> 00:28:27,180
like I think it's on wids have eight arms and two tentacles or something my

532
00:28:27,180 --> 00:28:30,460
hat there's something where there's a there's a difference between our only has

533
00:28:30,460 --> 00:28:34,300
has only a six well squid where it's not a squid because he doesn't have a well

534
00:28:34,300 --> 00:28:38,220
he doesn't have a beak well octopi have beaks to though well but squidward has a

535
00:28:38,220 --> 00:28:42,780
beak well he's also squidward does have a be just a gray guy yeah he's a blob

536
00:28:42,780 --> 00:28:48,260
yeah just fucking gray it's fine as a beak you guys know that octopi are

537
00:28:48,260 --> 00:28:52,500
actually from another planet yeah you know that their other DNA is alien it's

538
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:55,100
a completely alien they came from another planet came on a comet and they

539
00:28:55,100 --> 00:28:59,700
evolved alongside it's so cool have you have you if you have you ever seen those

540
00:28:59,700 --> 00:29:03,260
those like articles that are that are like from those like disclosure

541
00:29:03,260 --> 00:29:06,400
websites and stuff and they're like trying to say like scientists

542
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:10,760
confirm that octopi have alien dna and then you click on like their source

543
00:29:10,760 --> 00:29:15,700
and it's always like the scientists are being like octopi are such weird

544
00:29:15,700 --> 00:29:24,140
animals. They're so alien to life on land and then there it is. It's it's

545
00:29:24,140 --> 00:29:29,000
pretty funny. I'm pretty much fully adjusted to civilian life again. Yeah,

546
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:35,220
yep we should we should go back on tour I know we should do it yeah I'd be down I

547
00:29:35,220 --> 00:29:41,040
honestly I think that I've a dad like I had a my like my Amtrak to and from

548
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:48,280
Boston both times it felt like nothing I was like just I literally I was ended

549
00:29:48,280 --> 00:29:53,240
too soon no did you take a regional baby that's some good deals on the cellos I

550
00:29:53,240 --> 00:30:00,160
I I fucking yeah well I get nervous on the Amtrak now because the Amtrak like

551
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:03,880
broke down for three hours one time I was on it so now I think it's happen gonna

552
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:07,480
happen every time yeah that's scary I was like it was scary

553
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:12,320
it just sucked TJ Miller I just don't like I don't like Amtrak's like it's

554
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:17,160
just between a bus and a plane and it's so expensive I just don't like them it's

555
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:20,660
really I'd rather really pretty to look out the window no I like I like the

556
00:30:20,660 --> 00:30:25,780
train better than flying I love the trains you can walk to the the cafe car

557
00:30:25,780 --> 00:30:29,100
flying on your toes man I've had some fucking rough flights where I really

558
00:30:29,100 --> 00:30:33,180
thought I was gonna die that's a bad I like it it's good

559
00:30:33,180 --> 00:30:37,420
there's a cargo flight where they landed too hard oh yeah we hit yeah the guy

560
00:30:37,420 --> 00:30:41,380
next to me flew up and hit his head on the fucking like a bounce we got that it

561
00:30:41,380 --> 00:30:45,500
was so and I was like listen buddy buck your damn seatbelt over here okay why

562
00:30:45,500 --> 00:30:50,380
you know buckled your seatbelt but he was a thug with no fingers he was a thug he

563
00:30:50,380 --> 00:30:53,320
he's a thug with no fingers. How do you know he's a thug? Because he was like

564
00:30:53,320 --> 00:30:57,720
very weirdly, like loudly talking to me about how he was coming, or not to me,

565
00:30:57,720 --> 00:31:01,820
but like on the phone as we were before we took off on the tarmac, about how he

566
00:31:01,820 --> 00:31:05,040
was going to New York to sell drugs. And you think that makes someone a thug?

567
00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:07,840
Yeah, he's a thug. He's probably a pharmacist.

568
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:12,840
That's a thuggish behavior. I think that the entire pharmaceutical industry is

569
00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:16,680
a bunch of thugs. Okay, you got me there. Okay, but also he did have no fingers.

570
00:31:16,680 --> 00:31:19,440
He had no fingers and I didn't notice till halfway through the flight.

571
00:31:20,180 --> 00:31:25,780
he's a Yakuza. He was not a Yakuza. Yeah, like a John Wick. Yakuza's lose their

572
00:31:25,780 --> 00:31:29,980
pinky. No, he was a no finger. He might have been a Yakuza ten different times

573
00:31:29,980 --> 00:31:34,740
maybe. Yeah. He had no fingers at all and also he may he he had no fingers at

574
00:31:34,740 --> 00:31:38,180
all. Not a single finger. Not a single finger. How was he on his phone and

575
00:31:38,180 --> 00:31:42,140
stuff? He literally was using like a like a part of his hand where it looked

576
00:31:42,140 --> 00:31:45,340
like maybe there was a knuckle. So, but there was no fingernail. A part of his

577
00:31:45,340 --> 00:31:48,220
hand where it looked like he was a knuckle. But it was like it was like this.

578
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:51,580
It was like his thumb knuckle is all he I know what you mean, but you also

579
00:31:51,580 --> 00:31:55,780
described a finger yeah, okay, you're you're being a bitch. So he was using

580
00:31:55,780 --> 00:31:58,980
that on his phone. Yeah, yeah, sounds to me like you had ten for you didn't know,

581
00:31:58,980 --> 00:32:01,860
but he made me sit and he made me sit between him and his wife.

582
00:32:01,860 --> 00:32:07,540
He was like I was like because I traded seats with somebody so that they could

583
00:32:07,540 --> 00:32:11,580
sit next to their wife did the same thing and then I did that and so clear

584
00:32:11,580 --> 00:32:15,300
see was between these two people and I was like they say that's so crazy.

585
00:32:15,300 --> 00:32:18,940
So great. I think there was a wife swap trip. Well this lady this lady

586
00:32:18,940 --> 00:32:24,980
This lady was a wife swap happening on the plane. They all joined the mile-high club the whole time

587
00:32:24,980 --> 00:32:30,300
Are you fucking for real this guy couldn't even finger he didn't have any finger. No he

588
00:32:30,300 --> 00:32:35,540
Toes people he doesn't need to finger. He's got all of that. He can put it. He's not the palm

589
00:32:35,540 --> 00:32:41,300
Really bad for that guy. Yeah. Yeah, cuz I was like this guy. He has no fingers. He's

590
00:32:42,100 --> 00:32:44,580
he doesn't he has no that's why you didn't buckle a seatbelt I'm just

591
00:32:44,580 --> 00:32:47,620
remembering he didn't have any fucking fingers and he didn't ask me to help him

592
00:32:47,620 --> 00:32:50,780
and I almost like four different times asked him if he needed help with

593
00:32:50,780 --> 00:32:58,540
something because I was something such a good guy but he never did I I love he

594
00:32:58,540 --> 00:33:04,380
was completely real I when I wish I'd taken a picture of him but I was in

595
00:33:04,380 --> 00:33:09,500
yeah no I he asked me if I worked at Waffle House is where my Waffle House at

596
00:33:09,500 --> 00:33:14,540
that when I got I was in do you work at Waffle House no I'm sorry can I take

597
00:33:14,540 --> 00:33:21,740
your picture I was in Boston and I was um downtown and I was like got off the

598
00:33:21,740 --> 00:33:27,620
the Park Street stop yeah and there's this like old lady with those kind of

599
00:33:27,620 --> 00:33:31,820
like arm crutches that she's using to like help herself walk and she was just

600
00:33:31,820 --> 00:33:34,820
kind of standing outside of the Park Street station she was asking everybody

601
00:33:34,820 --> 00:33:39,420
like do you know where the movie theater is and nobody was answering her so I like

602
00:33:39,420 --> 00:33:42,300
went up to her and I was like oh yeah the movie theater like it's right down

603
00:33:42,300 --> 00:33:44,900
there like it's straight down this street it's on the left a couple blocks

604
00:33:44,900 --> 00:33:48,180
down you can't miss it just that way and she's like oh thank you so much and she

605
00:33:48,180 --> 00:33:51,860
like started walking and she was walking very slowly and I went like I was going

606
00:33:51,860 --> 00:33:54,900
to the comment to sit in the common to like read and I was like sitting and I

607
00:33:54,900 --> 00:34:00,380
could like see the movie theater I could see her like walking towards it and she

608
00:34:00,380 --> 00:34:04,660
like sitting and watching her walk really slowly towards it and then at one

609
00:34:04,660 --> 00:34:07,580
of those like you know those like huge apartment buildings that are along the

610
00:34:07,580 --> 00:34:12,780
away. There's your evolving door and she just turned left and went into that

611
00:34:12,780 --> 00:34:16,720
revolving door and just went all the way around like three

612
00:34:16,720 --> 00:34:26,740
yeah. I was like I probably should have like I don't know. I mean she's

613
00:34:26,740 --> 00:34:31,600
leaning to go home or something fucking things is a good and find the movie

614
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:35,200
fishing a bit of red flag yeah, very I think you let

615
00:34:36,940 --> 00:34:43,940
really bad situation. I think you let a woman with dementia just like... Yeah just run free.

616
00:34:43,940 --> 00:34:51,580
Yeah I felt kind of bad after I saw her do that. Let's get these hospital wristbands

617
00:34:51,580 --> 00:34:56,340
off. These must be weighing you down. Yeah. Can you take these off please? No problem.

too warm yeah no problem yeah.

620
00:35:03,500 --> 00:35:05,500
I made it myself into the sweater.

621
00:35:05,500 --> 00:35:07,500
I can't get out.

622
00:35:07,500 --> 00:35:11,700
What happens old women just don't even worry about it yeah I'll let you out of it.

623
00:35:11,700 --> 00:35:18,060
Yeah the part that made me feel the part where I felt like maybe I was in like a like yeah

624
00:35:18,060 --> 00:35:22,340
what would you do or like a fable or something was what because like when I I was saying

625
00:35:22,340 --> 00:35:25,380
that I was like I think I had like oh it's not that far I guess I could like also I could

626
00:35:25,380 --> 00:35:29,460
like offer to walk I could be like oh like and I was like oh no it's fine it's just a

627
00:35:29,460 --> 00:35:33,600
straight line yeah that's weird yeah and then like leaving and seeing her do that

628
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:36,980
I was like oh my god all of a sudden she's fucking I'm a bad lady from yes

629
00:35:36,980 --> 00:35:43,020
man gumming your penis you can't have that oh yeah you don't want that right

630
00:35:43,020 --> 00:35:47,700
feel good do you know that if I actually did that it was all for the movie they

631
00:35:47,700 --> 00:35:51,020

632
00:35:51,020 --> 00:35:54,500
actually got dome from the gold lady with no teeth it's like a brown but they

633
00:35:54,500 --> 00:35:57,660
should have released the brown boney cut yeah they really should have so mighty

634
00:35:57,660 --> 00:36:02,580
he yeah it's a final woman. Yeah, it wasn't Bruce Almighty though. Oh right,

635
00:36:02,580 --> 00:36:03,740
yes, yes, yes, yes,

636
00:36:03,740 --> 00:36:08,900
and they would never do anything sexual like that. They should add that into

637
00:36:08,900 --> 00:36:13,700
more. It's so cool that Bruce Almighty is like like have God is Morgan Freeman

638
00:36:13,700 --> 00:36:15,380
and it's funny and like God,

639
00:36:15,380 --> 00:36:20,260
Christianity and then Evan Almighty is like God's a hundred percent real and

640
00:36:20,260 --> 00:36:24,620
this is like all about how God is good. That's such a cool way to do the second

641
00:36:24,660 --> 00:36:30,260
movie. Yeah, because they ditched a Jim Carrey piece of shit liberal Jim Carrey

642
00:36:30,260 --> 00:36:33,560
and they got Michael Scott. They got Michael Scott who's actually Catholic.

643
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:36,540
Every good director knows if you want to do a sequel you have to you have to

644
00:36:36,540 --> 00:36:39,900
change the stakes you have to change it a bit you know alien to aliens. Yep.

645
00:36:39,900 --> 00:36:43,980
Right there's two aliens. Yeah Batman Begins the Dark Knight you got to add a

646
00:36:43,980 --> 00:36:48,900
Joker. Yeah. You're and Dark Knight to Devil May Rise. You got to take this shit

647
00:36:48,900 --> 00:36:52,180
seriously. You're right dude when it comes to filmmaking you do have to take

648
00:36:52,180 --> 00:36:54,840
seriously if you want to make a brilliant it's a crap it's a craft if you

649
00:36:54,840 --> 00:36:58,960
don't think it's movie people people think it's they don't even think the

650
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:02,360
playing around can you believe that people still think talkies aren't art

651
00:37:02,360 --> 00:37:08,600
what are talkies talkies talkies like oh like the snack no like when movies have

652
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:16,020
all those - though I saw an ad for talkies before the movie what movie the

653
00:37:16,020 --> 00:37:21,100
movie with no the movie with no sound the movie no time movie no talk it's

654
00:37:21,100 --> 00:37:27,880
just movie no talking. Picture only movie. Picture only movie.

655
00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:33,220
Accordion player. Organ player. It's an organ not an accordion. Well there's an

656
00:37:33,220 --> 00:37:39,300
accordion at this one. Really? Yeah. Wow. In between the movies. There's two movies.

657
00:37:39,300 --> 00:37:43,560
No talkie both? No talkie both. Wow. In between you got to do the chicken dance.

658
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:47,820
I fucking love that dance. Yep. I'm always looking for places I can do the chicken

659
00:37:47,820 --> 00:37:50,260
dance. They started phasing it out.

660
00:37:50,260 --> 00:37:52,980
They don't do it at weddings anymore, I learned.

661
00:37:52,980 --> 00:37:54,420
I did it at a wedding.

662
00:37:54,420 --> 00:37:57,300
They probably do the non-binary gender dance now.

663
00:37:57,300 --> 00:37:58,300
Yeah.

664
00:37:58,300 --> 00:37:59,300
Yeah.

665
00:37:59,300 --> 00:38:00,300
Yeah.

666
00:38:00,300 --> 00:38:01,300
Probably, yeah.

667
00:38:01,300 --> 00:38:02,300
They probably put your blue hair in.

668
00:38:02,300 --> 00:38:05,460
Put your wage gap out.

669
00:38:05,460 --> 00:38:10,100
Chicken dance is probably, chick, eh, dance, because nowadays they're not chicks.

670
00:38:10,100 --> 00:38:11,100
Not even chicks anymore.

671
00:38:11,100 --> 00:38:12,100
They're some, whatever.

672
00:38:12,100 --> 00:38:14,100
You have to call them Samantha.

673
00:38:14,100 --> 00:38:15,100
Yep.

674
00:38:15,100 --> 00:38:18,860
You have to call them Brianna and you have to call them Ashley.

675
00:38:18,860 --> 00:38:19,980
And you have to call them...

676
00:38:19,980 --> 00:38:21,020
Instead of chick.

677
00:38:21,020 --> 00:38:23,420
Instead of, "Hey you dumb broad."

678
00:38:23,420 --> 00:38:24,940
I would never say that.

679
00:38:24,940 --> 00:38:26,220
That's a little much.

680
00:38:26,220 --> 00:38:27,100
That's a little mouthy.

681
00:38:27,100 --> 00:38:28,460
I don't think you ever could say that.

682
00:38:28,460 --> 00:38:36,940
And you have to call them Myrtle and you have to call them Moysha.

683
00:38:36,940 --> 00:38:39,980
What the fuck are you on about?

684
00:38:39,980 --> 00:38:42,300

688
00:38:50,460 --> 00:38:55,740

709
00:39:43,640 --> 00:39:45,800
I forgot to flush my poop.

710
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:46,640

- Oh, while we were in Boston, I didn't tell you guys this.

722
00:40:04,820 --> 00:40:06,860
The last night that we had at the hotel,

723
00:40:06,860 --> 00:40:08,500
we took Phil to Boston.

724
00:40:08,500 --> 00:40:12,540
and I took him downstairs to go poop outside. He didn't poop and then we

725
00:40:12,540 --> 00:40:16,500
walked back in and it was like it was like three or four in the morning and

726
00:40:16,500 --> 00:40:20,320
there was nobody working there and he just like pooped all in the middle of

727
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:21,740
the hotel,

728
00:40:21,740 --> 00:40:28,380
the floor of the hotel and I didn't have a bag or any paper towels, so I just I

729
00:40:28,380 --> 00:40:29,100
just left it there.

730
00:40:29,100 --> 00:40:34,980

Was I watched the new the new Top Gun?

756
00:42:46,820 --> 00:42:51,220
Movie and you know how they all call they all have like they have great call signs

757
00:42:51,220 --> 00:42:55,500

i don't know

761
00:43:01,940 --> 00:43:05,620
uh... but i think that i don't know if they let you pick your own but i think

762
00:43:05,620 --> 00:43:06,940
that if i was in

763
00:43:06,940 --> 00:43:10,620
the top gun academy michael's i would probably be like ultimate destroyer

764
00:43:10,620 --> 00:43:11,500
attacker of

765
00:43:11,500 --> 00:43:15,500
destruction money patrick the plane roger roger

766
00:43:15,500 --> 00:43:19,300
to actually had a guy who's called site his name is bob as close i was bob and

767
00:43:19,300 --> 00:43:22,700
as comedic in the movie so they wouldn't laugh too hard a little joke since it's

768
00:43:22,700 --> 00:43:27,060
basically are doing my name would be patrick the plane out of a detail of

769
00:43:27,060 --> 00:43:30,420
mind face i think that my name would be bowser

770
00:43:30,420 --> 00:43:33,660
that was actually a really good idea roger maverick to bowser

771
00:43:33,660 --> 00:43:37,740
yeah i'm a robot display nature of my god i'm actually i don't know how to

00:43:39,900 --> 00:43:40,740
well

774
00:43:40,740 --> 00:43:41,540
uh...

775
00:43:41,540 --> 00:43:42,580
well

776
00:43:42,580 --> 00:43:44,940
and getting shut down by the enemy and shit

777
00:43:44,940 --> 00:43:47,940
all my god actually i'm dying home i got all you have a side by president

778
00:43:47,940 --> 00:43:52,300
stockham my god they're actually doing torture to me

779
00:43:52,300 --> 00:43:57,500
yeah man this kamikaze oh my god pearl harbor oh my god the plane literally

780
00:43:57,500 --> 00:44:01,980
flew into the building whoa i would hate if my day if i was tried to join the uh

781
00:44:01,980 --> 00:44:07,420
navy or the uh top gun academy and because my dad's call sign was goose

782
00:44:07,420 --> 00:44:10,940
they're like you have to be a rooster just because my dad picked a terrible

783
00:44:10,940 --> 00:44:14,060
name i should get to be so because the movie was actually made this year in

784
00:44:14,060 --> 00:44:19,500
2002 volcano was it called something was it called something

785
00:44:20,140 --> 00:44:20,980
black hole.

786
00:44:20,980 --> 00:44:24,440
What's up was it called something instead of top gun was it called maybe

787
00:44:24,440 --> 00:44:28,700
bottoms bottom fun nowadays. That's what they call it. I actually called

788
00:44:28,700 --> 00:44:32,820
Top Gun Maverick though. Okay, bottom bottoms have fun when they have dick.

789
00:44:32,820 --> 00:44:39,300
What do you think? I think

790
00:44:39,300 --> 00:44:43,980
Maverick is a funny name. Would that be the new version of it? That is it.

791
00:44:43,980 --> 00:44:45,900
Yeah, that's definitely what they call it. I think

792
00:44:47,040 --> 00:44:50,160
because the guys because maverick the one that's the one on john cody

793
00:44:50,160 --> 00:44:55,560
because maverick is just the main characters name it'll be like if they

794
00:44:55,560 --> 00:45:00,160
called the new matrix like the matrix neo they sure like they should have i

795
00:45:00,160 --> 00:45:03,080
think that they should call most new movies things he's hardly in the movie

796
00:45:03,080 --> 00:45:06,360
though yeah that's why they're calling star wars they're calling in star wars

797
00:45:06,360 --> 00:45:07,640
yoda yeah

798
00:45:07,640 --> 00:45:12,600
dude you know they're you jest but i think there are things going down the

799
00:45:12,600 --> 00:45:17,900
R2D2 a robots tail. Yeah, they're going to have a tail. I think with a robots

800
00:45:17,900 --> 00:45:22,560
parts, he lost it. I think within the next two years, every character in the

801
00:45:22,560 --> 00:45:27,920
original movie will have a TV series. Not the puddler. The puddler will. No,

802
00:45:27,920 --> 00:45:30,460
cause he doesn't. Actually, that's already in the words. He won't have a

803
00:45:30,460 --> 00:45:34,340
movie, cause he doesn't even exist. The puddler does exist in it. The puddler,

804
00:45:34,340 --> 00:45:38,120
yeah. He's a force sensitive rhodian from. They put the puddler into one of

805
00:45:38,120 --> 00:45:41,000
the remasters and they took him out of the next one, but he was in there. The

806
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:44,360
puddler was a four sensitive rhodium, but he didn't know he was four sensitive

807
00:45:44,360 --> 00:45:49,020
until one day he made a puddle. I'm having a suspicious face. I'm not sure

808
00:45:49,020 --> 00:45:52,280
that either of these three things and the road and he was a rhodium, you know,

809
00:45:52,280 --> 00:45:57,800
like Greedo yeah and he would go like you don't want your what the fuck hey

810
00:45:57,800 --> 00:46:04,060
Caleb Caleb. It says it says gullible on the inside of your wallet and I need to

811
00:46:04,060 --> 00:46:07,160
read it. It says gullible on my ceiling at home. Do you need to read it really?

812
00:46:07,180 --> 00:46:11,220
you need to read or you need to read it. So you need to take every it's on the

813
00:46:11,220 --> 00:46:15,700
bottom or under everything like to see all the money moving aside. No it's

814
00:46:15,700 --> 00:46:19,680
behind that it's actually on each of the money. I don't have any. I have a

815
00:46:19,680 --> 00:46:23,560
bunch of receipts. Oh, they doesn't say it in me that so I can erase them. I

816
00:46:23,560 --> 00:46:24,800
race it go ahead, okay,

817
00:46:24,800 --> 00:46:31,340
okay, it actually also says gullible. Where does it say go? It's got to be my

818
00:46:31,340 --> 00:46:34,740
favorite word to read. It's probably in your bank account. It's in my bank

819
00:46:34,780 --> 00:46:37,480
bank account yeah, so you'll need to all right. I'll just go to the bank after

820
00:46:37,480 --> 00:46:40,740
this, okay, and I need to come with you because I need to read.

821
00:46:40,740 --> 00:46:47,360
I guess I need to read it okay, the gullible yeah, you just want to look at

822
00:46:47,360 --> 00:46:50,980
my bank account. That's all you want to do yeah to see if the gullible is

823
00:46:50,980 --> 00:46:54,940
written as gullible yeah, that's not a problem for me yeah. I don't know why

824
00:46:54,940 --> 00:46:58,740
that would be an issue yeah. I mean yeah, that weird I don't yeah. Patrick

825
00:46:58,740 --> 00:47:01,980
is is your gullible written on all my cards because you're taking a picture of

826
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:04,500
That's why I have to take a picture of every single one of your cards.

827
00:47:04,500 --> 00:47:05,200
Oh, okay.

828
00:47:05,200 --> 00:47:09,000
I'm taking a picture of a few people's credit cards as a joke, like in front of them.

829
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:09,500
Yeah.

830
00:47:09,500 --> 00:47:15,200
But, like, I do feel like I'm gonna lose my phone someday, and like a bunch of people's identities are gonna get stolen or something.

831
00:47:15,200 --> 00:47:19,500
Patrick's gonna get fappeninged, and somebody's gonna get my fucking card.

832
00:47:19,500 --> 00:47:20,000
Oh my god.

833
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:24,000
Well, good luck to you.

834
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:27,000
You can actually lower the exposure and completely make it out.

835
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:31,000
Have fun, Jordan.

836
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:33,320
I didn't even realize that's how pretty it is.

837
00:47:33,320 --> 00:47:34,320
Did you hear that?

838
00:47:34,320 --> 00:47:37,440
He sounded, he just did a cartoon underwater bubble talk noise.

839
00:47:37,440 --> 00:47:38,440
Really?

840
00:47:38,440 --> 00:47:39,440
He went, "Brrrrr."

841
00:47:39,440 --> 00:47:40,440
Look at that.

842
00:47:40,440 --> 00:47:41,440
Wow, that's too bright.

843
00:47:41,440 --> 00:47:42,440
It's too bright a picture.

844
00:47:42,440 --> 00:47:50,320
Do you guys think that the podcast is big enough now that we could be subject to the

845
00:47:50,320 --> 00:47:51,320
fat-putting?

846
00:47:51,320 --> 00:47:52,320
I hope not.

847
00:47:52,320 --> 00:47:59,440
No, because I've never sent a nude, never taken one, and I've never taken my clothes

848
00:47:59,440 --> 00:48:00,440
off.

849
00:48:00,440 --> 00:48:05,400
What really never never my life. I would honestly I'm serious. I would rather

850
00:48:05,400 --> 00:48:09,560
fucking die than be naked in front of anybody. Yeah. Yeah. I think I would

851
00:48:09,560 --> 00:48:13,320
rather I would rather be fucking executed. I probably would rather be

852
00:48:13,320 --> 00:48:18,040
dead than anybody seeing take no not even the well the fappening fappening

853
00:48:18,040 --> 00:48:21,240
the fapping you always pretend. It's not your body. You know I'd rather my

854
00:48:21,240 --> 00:48:25,640
entire fucking family die, but I would also rather I would also rather my

855
00:48:25,640 --> 00:48:29,320
entire family and I survive than the fapping their money than the fapping

856
00:48:29,320 --> 00:48:33,200
not happen again to more celebrities.

857
00:48:33,200 --> 00:48:34,200
Like who?

858
00:48:34,200 --> 00:48:37,000
Celebrities I want to see naked.

859
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:38,000
Wait.

860
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:39,000
What?

861
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:40,960
That's what the fappening was?

862
00:48:40,960 --> 00:48:43,280
What did you think it was?

863
00:48:43,280 --> 00:48:46,480
Kind of like a flash mob.

864
00:48:46,480 --> 00:48:48,680
You thought it was a flash mob of just a bunch of men?

865
00:48:48,680 --> 00:48:50,920
Well they were all flashing everybody with their nudes.

866
00:48:50,920 --> 00:48:51,920
That is true.

867
00:48:51,920 --> 00:48:53,600
That's what I'm complaining.

868
00:48:53,600 --> 00:48:56,920
No one, hey ScarJo, ain't nobody want to see that girl.

869
00:48:56,920 --> 00:48:57,920
Uh huh.

870
00:48:57,920 --> 00:49:00,420
- Girl, ain't nobody wanna see that bullshit.

871
00:49:00,420 --> 00:49:01,800
Put that thing back in your pants.

872
00:49:01,800 --> 00:49:03,000
- That needs to stay in the movies.

873
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:03,840
- Put away your green eggs and ham.

874
00:49:03,840 --> 00:49:04,680
- Put that thing away.

875
00:49:04,680 --> 00:49:06,800
Save it for the silver screen, okay?

876
00:49:06,800 --> 00:49:08,480
I don't wanna see it on my tiny ass phone.

877
00:49:08,480 --> 00:49:09,920
- Put it in your, put it in the--

878
00:49:09,920 --> 00:49:12,360
- Is a movie is a silver screen?

879
00:49:12,360 --> 00:49:14,520
Is a TV a bronze screen?

880
00:49:14,520 --> 00:49:16,400
- TV is-- - What's the gold screen?

881
00:49:16,400 --> 00:49:17,880
- TV is the tubular--

882
00:49:17,880 --> 00:49:19,920
- That's a little thing I've been workshopping

883
00:49:19,920 --> 00:49:20,760
that I might be trying out.

884
00:49:20,760 --> 00:49:22,720
- I don't think that you should continue trying that out.

885
00:49:22,720 --> 00:49:24,880
I think that might be one of the worst ideas I've ever heard.

886
00:49:24,880 --> 00:49:25,680
- So silver screen's in movies?

887
00:49:25,680 --> 00:49:26,520
- Yep, okay, wait.

888
00:49:26,520 --> 00:49:27,760
He's actually doing a stand up cadence now.

889
00:49:27,760 --> 00:49:28,760
Okay, hold on, wait.

890
00:49:28,760 --> 00:49:31,760
And I'll, wait, so if the, so the silver screen's movies.

891
00:49:31,760 --> 00:49:32,760
Yep.

892
00:49:32,760 --> 00:49:33,760
And the silver screen is Shell.

893
00:49:33,760 --> 00:49:35,600
And then what, well, okay, wait.

894
00:49:35,600 --> 00:49:37,360
So the silver screen's movies.

895
00:49:37,360 --> 00:49:38,360
Yeah.

896
00:49:38,360 --> 00:49:40,080
Well, okay, at least good movies.

897
00:49:40,080 --> 00:49:42,520
A bad movie, that's a black screen, 'cause I turn it off.

898
00:49:42,520 --> 00:49:43,520
Yep.

899
00:49:43,520 --> 00:49:44,520
Holy shit.

900
00:49:44,520 --> 00:49:45,520
And the silver and-

901
00:49:45,520 --> 00:49:49,160
Oh, and if it's a black screen and little, and green mysterious symbols show up, that's

902
00:49:49,160 --> 00:49:50,160
a movie too.

903
00:49:50,160 --> 00:49:53,280
And the Silverman is saved, 'cause that's the movie I'm putting on, saving Silverman.

904
00:49:53,280 --> 00:49:55,840
I would like to save Sarah Silverman.

905
00:49:55,840 --> 00:49:56,840
From what?

906
00:49:56,840 --> 00:50:04,280
save from herself. She's in a downward spiral folks. I saw her one time at a

907
00:50:04,280 --> 00:50:08,320
place in our life. Her life is falling apart. You guys should see her

908
00:50:08,320 --> 00:50:14,400
documentary television show. It's fucked up. She's from Bedford, New Hampshire, right?

909
00:50:14,400 --> 00:50:19,840
Yep, and my friend's mom in high school saw her at Walmart. I saw her in

910
00:50:19,840 --> 00:50:25,160
Los Angeles. Yep, just more evidence that her life is falling apart. She's fucking,

911
00:50:25,160 --> 00:50:30,200
She's a dumpster fire. I mean, I think probably one of the only ways I could keep her safe from

912
00:50:30,200 --> 00:50:35,560
this terrible tragedy that's befalling her and kind of the way that she's kind of losing her shit

913
00:50:35,560 --> 00:50:41,960
is I might have to, um, I think that she wouldn't be able to, you know, continue devastating herself

914
00:50:41,960 --> 00:50:43,560
if she was in a dog cage.

915
00:50:43,560 --> 00:50:46,760
Yep. I think you're right. Protect her from herself.

916
00:50:46,760 --> 00:50:48,760
We need her protected.

917
00:50:48,760 --> 00:50:50,760
Maybe in a dog cage in my garage.

918
00:50:50,760 --> 00:50:52,760
Yeah, there was...

919
00:50:52,760 --> 00:50:54,760
It's musty as fuck in there.

920
00:50:54,760 --> 00:50:57,760
There's a dog cage out back.

921
00:50:57,760 --> 00:51:02,760
Yeah, oh, and I should specify, Chihuahua dog cage.

922
00:51:02,760 --> 00:51:03,760
Small.

923
00:51:03,760 --> 00:51:04,760
She ain't gonna fit in that playboy.

924
00:51:04,760 --> 00:51:05,760
Well, that's the point.

925
00:51:05,760 --> 00:51:08,760
I mean, if she works on herself, she'll fit into something like that.

926
00:51:08,760 --> 00:51:10,760
We're gonna grow her into a square like a Japanese watermelon.

927
00:51:10,760 --> 00:51:13,760
That's what we're gonna do to her.

928
00:51:13,760 --> 00:51:15,760
She's gonna be a cube.

929
00:51:15,760 --> 00:51:18,760
We're growing Sarah Silverman into a cube.

930
00:51:18,760 --> 00:51:19,760
She's gonna be a complete cube.

931
00:51:19,760 --> 00:51:20,760
Like a Japanese watermelon.

932
00:51:20,760 --> 00:51:22,760
That's what she's gonna be.

933
00:51:22,760 --> 00:51:29,240
She's gonna be stuck in a cube. I have, but it's a cage so she's gonna have little

934
00:51:29,240 --> 00:51:32,080
it's gonna she'll have parts that are sticking out between the bars. Yeah. I

935
00:51:32,080 --> 00:51:35,640
think she's kind of like a bumpy cube. I don't care that she's 95 years old. I

936
00:51:35,640 --> 00:51:40,400
don't care what she's doing to the people around her. I brother I think that

937
00:51:40,400 --> 00:51:44,720
was probably my first ever middle school Mr. Skin Search Sarah Silverman. Wow.

938
00:51:44,720 --> 00:51:45,720
Wow.

939
00:51:45,720 --> 00:51:46,720
Yeah.

940
00:51:46,720 --> 00:51:47,720
She, you know what?

941
00:51:47,720 --> 00:51:48,720
Wow.

942
00:51:48,720 --> 00:51:49,720
Wow.

943
00:51:49,720 --> 00:51:50,720
Wow.

944
00:51:50,720 --> 00:51:51,720
Wow.

945
00:51:51,720 --> 00:51:52,720
Yeah.

946
00:51:52,720 --> 00:51:57,280
She was a Bedford Bulldog and for that, she can fuck off.

947
00:51:57,280 --> 00:51:58,280
We don't fuck with that?

948
00:51:58,280 --> 00:51:59,280
I don't, yeah.

949
00:51:59,280 --> 00:52:00,280
Uh-uh.

950
00:52:00,280 --> 00:52:01,280
Nope.

951
00:52:01,280 --> 00:52:02,280
Those are your, wait, Patrick.

952
00:52:02,280 --> 00:52:03,280
Nope.

953
00:52:03,280 --> 00:52:04,280
Lancers, baby.

954
00:52:04,280 --> 00:52:05,280
Are those your ops?

955
00:52:05,280 --> 00:52:06,280
Those are my ops.

956
00:52:06,280 --> 00:52:07,280
Really?

957
00:52:07,280 --> 00:52:08,280
I fucking hate my ops.

958
00:52:08,280 --> 00:52:09,280
Don't even get me started on the Pinkerton Astros.

959
00:52:09,280 --> 00:52:10,280
I honestly fucking hate my ops.

960
00:52:10,280 --> 00:52:11,280
Yeah, my ops ain't shit.

961
00:52:11,280 --> 00:52:12,280
Oh my God, I hate my ops.

962
00:52:12,280 --> 00:52:13,280
Oh my God, I actually hate my ops.

963
00:52:13,280 --> 00:52:14,280
