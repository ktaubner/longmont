1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,160
(sipping)

2
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:04,320
(sipping)

3
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:11,880
(burping)

4
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:13,280
- You're listening to Beers We Drink,

5
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:15,440
America's number one beer podcast.

6
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:16,360
(record scratching)

7
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:18,940
(upbeat music)

8
00:00:18,940 --> 00:00:21,320
- What's up all my chuggers?

9
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:22,580
I'm trying to get that move on.

10
00:00:22,580 --> 00:00:25,000
(gagging)

11
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,480
- This is a journey of interstitial,

12
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:28,320
- Plain and kind,

13
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:29,160
- Bud Light,

14
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:30,160
Food ribbon!

15
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:32,340
Beers we drank, motherfucker,

16
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:34,360
with Jubio, Caleb and Rex.

17
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:37,680
Much better.

18
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:40,000
Oh, you start. Hold on.

19
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,320
Wait, hold on.

20
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:42,480
You said you were ready. What the fuck?

21
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:44,160
Oh, I just it wasn't that ready.

22
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:45,680
I thought you were going to say, like, are you ready?

23
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:47,520
Go.

24
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:49,800
All right. You go first, Jubio.

25
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:51,480
I've gone first so many times recently.

26
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:54,200
OK. Today I am paying

27
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:56,640
my respects to the

28
00:00:57,400 --> 00:00:59,840
the great nation of Japan.

29
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:04,340
And I got something that's called the lemon dour,

30
00:01:04,340 --> 00:01:09,100
lemon dour, lemon sour, honey, lemon, lemon, dour, lemon, sour.

31
00:01:09,100 --> 00:01:12,240
Come on, sour.

32
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:15,040
Yeah, I don't I've never had one of these before.

33
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:18,600
And I saw the can and I saw that it said shit in Japanese.

34
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:21,740
And I was like, well, that sounds Japan.

35
00:01:21,740 --> 00:01:23,960
Yeah, Japan.

36
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:25,660
So you did. Yeah.

37
00:01:25,660 --> 00:01:29,260
-Shitty beer America, shitty beer Japan.

38
00:01:29,260 --> 00:01:30,940
-Yes, that's right.

39
00:01:30,940 --> 00:01:33,140
-Basically, today's the meme episode as well.

40
00:01:33,140 --> 00:01:37,660
We're going to be just reciting memes that we thought about for the entire episode.

41
00:01:37,660 --> 00:01:40,820
-You will never-- He will never drink a Japanese beer.

42
00:01:40,820 --> 00:01:51,580
-Goes to the-- Fuck, I was thinking of a bad luck Brian,

43
00:01:51,580 --> 00:01:52,820
but I couldn't think of one.

44
00:01:52,820 --> 00:01:56,180
Goes to Japan, gets a beer.

45
00:01:56,180 --> 00:01:59,940
And it sucks.

46
00:01:59,940 --> 00:02:00,940
And it's not good.

47
00:02:00,940 --> 00:02:03,460
It's a second meme that just has the top of part of it.

48
00:02:03,460 --> 00:02:05,220
It's a two page.

49
00:02:05,220 --> 00:02:06,700
It's a front and back printed side.

50
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:07,940
Right.

51
00:02:07,940 --> 00:02:08,420
Yeah.

52
00:02:08,420 --> 00:02:09,740
Take a sip to give us a review.

53
00:02:09,740 --> 00:02:13,540
I'll tell you what I have.

54
00:02:13,540 --> 00:02:14,700
It's lemon and sour.

55
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:16,740
OK, you have lemon and sour.

56
00:02:16,740 --> 00:02:19,460
A high score.

57
00:02:19,460 --> 00:02:21,720
(laughing)

58
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:24,440
- Okay.

59
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:27,420
And what are the notes on this one?

60
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:30,820
- Lemonade, mango, passion fruit, and raspberry.

61
00:02:30,820 --> 00:02:31,660
- Take a sip.

62
00:02:31,660 --> 00:02:35,040
- Do you think he's ever gonna run out of video game beers

63
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:36,940
before he leaves the country?

64
00:02:36,940 --> 00:02:38,540
- Never, never ever.

65
00:02:38,540 --> 00:02:40,660
- You don't look good.

66
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:42,700
- Give it a number, give it a number.

67
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:43,540
We are now going--

68
00:02:43,540 --> 00:02:45,540
- I would not give it a high score.

69
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:47,780
I'll give it a low score.

70
00:02:47,780 --> 00:02:48,980
- Nice.

71
00:02:48,980 --> 00:02:52,280
Yeah, it's like a five out of ten so far. It's okay.

72
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:53,980
What's the high score over here?

73
00:02:53,980 --> 00:02:54,980
Yeah, it's a low score.

74
00:02:54,980 --> 00:02:56,980
Probably like Brian.

75
00:02:56,980 --> 00:02:58,980
Or Penguin.

76
00:02:58,980 --> 00:03:04,480
Well, me today, I have a...

77
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:08,480
This peaked my interest, caught my eye over there at the grocery store.

78
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:11,980
I have a giant hard tea.

79
00:03:11,980 --> 00:03:14,980
Kiwi strawberry hard yerba mate.

80
00:03:14,980 --> 00:03:17,480
The fucking Alexa timer's going off, goddammit.

81
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:19,480
Shut up!

82
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:27,480
Sorry. The Giant Hard Tea Yerba Mate Craft Brewed Sparkling Tea Kiwi Strawberry.

83
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:29,480
It's only got 4 grams of sugar.

84
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:32,480
It's called Giant. I thought it was Bakely. Huge.

85
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:34,480
It's not that huge. I would say it's...

86
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:36,480
It's probably a small, normal-sized can.

87
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:38,480
It's a smaller tall boy. It's 19.2.

88
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:41,480
It looks like a normal can if you put it next to your head.

89
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:43,480
It's a small boy can.

90
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:45,480
It should be very small.

91
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:47,320
You have the big head.

92
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:51,280
Yeah, you're a tiny you're a tiny guy.

93
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:53,020
Yeah, you're a small baby.

94
00:03:53,020 --> 00:03:54,820
No, I'm not that small.

95
00:03:54,820 --> 00:03:56,560
I'm going to take my sip.

96
00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:03,360
It does not taste anything like alcohol, I'm going to be honest with you.

97
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:04,700
That's good.

98
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:06,200
What is it? Just tea?

99
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:09,640
It's a hard yerba mate, like kind of hard kombucha, I guess.

100
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:13,440
Yeah. Isn't yerba mate like a caffeinated beverage?

101
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:15,280
Yeah, you're gonna be wired, bro.

102
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:17,040
It's funny that you say that.

103
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:21,720
It has less than 25 milligrams of naturally occurring caffeine.

104
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:22,520
So probably around--

105
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:26,720
Does it have any energy effects of Yerba Mate?

106
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:28,960
Well, I believe that is just caffeine from Yerba Mate.

107
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:30,120
My mate?

108
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:31,320
That is the energizing effect.

109
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:33,960
How much caffeine is in a regular Coke?

110
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:34,600
Like 60?

111
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:35,880
60-something?

112
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:36,380
Yeah.

113
00:04:36,380 --> 00:04:37,440
65?

114
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:38,520
Less than a Coke?

115
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:39,240
So you'll be fine.

116
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:40,240
It's less than a Coke.

117
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:43,840
And it also has that downer kind of thing to it.

118
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:44,880
Yeah.

119
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:49,360
Yeah. It's not very good. I'll probably never get this again.

120
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:51,200
I'm a downer when I'm drinking my beer.

121
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:54,680
Right.

122
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:59,320
You're having every last drop of these. Okay. Beer report. Wait,

123
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:02,040
who knew this was coming? Beer report this week.

124
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:07,800
I went to Evil Twin Brewing Company in Brooklyn,

125
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:10,080
New York City the other day.

126
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:16,160
and I had two beers. One of them was a sangria sour, not my kind of thing. It was way too sweet.

127
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:21,280
I got a 10 ounce. I probably could have drank four ounces of it. Been happy. The second one though

128
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:26,480
is a beer called, and I remember Noah talked about this when we had him on. It's a beer called a

129
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:36,320
Hefeweizen. It tasted like, drum roll please. My boat's in shit. That's my bet. No. Tasted like

130
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:37,460
- I don't quite.

131
00:05:37,460 --> 00:05:38,700
- A banana.

132
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:39,540
- Yummy.

133
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:40,380
- Oh, okay.

134
00:05:40,380 --> 00:05:41,400
(laughs)

135
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:42,240
Banana beer?

136
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:44,220
- So, it was amazing.

137
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:45,560
Monkeys take note.

138
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:48,100
This is the beer for you.

139
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:50,340
Any monkey who listens, this is your beer.

140
00:05:50,340 --> 00:05:51,180
This is an amazing beer.

141
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:52,180
- Well, monkeys make wine.

142
00:05:52,180 --> 00:05:53,780
Monkeys are into wine.

143
00:05:53,780 --> 00:05:54,620
- Oh, isn't--

144
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:55,440
- Explain.

145
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:56,280
- They make wine?

146
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:57,120
- Explain this.

147
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:57,940
- What are you saying?

148
00:05:57,940 --> 00:05:58,780
- I don't understand, what are you saying?

149
00:05:58,780 --> 00:06:01,580
- No, they just love to make, they make booze.

150
00:06:01,580 --> 00:06:02,420
They make wine.

151
00:06:02,420 --> 00:06:03,260
- No, they don't.

152
00:06:03,260 --> 00:06:04,080
You're lying.

153
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:04,920
- They do, and they drink it.

154
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:05,800
- Monkeys don't make wine.

155
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:06,800
and make you drink it.

156
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:07,800
- It's real.

157
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:09,680
- You're thinking-- - Believe me.

158
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:11,120
- You're thinking of humans. - You're thinking of the joke.

159
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12,480
- Why don't you believe me?

160
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:16,120
- Why did I not believe you that you said monkeys make wine?

161
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:16,960
I don't know.

162
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:20,440
- 'Cause they make wine, dude.

163
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:23,560
- And they prepare it over beer as well.

164
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:25,120
- Well, they don't know how to make beer.

165
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:27,600
They have wine stuff. - That's true.

166
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:29,160
- But they know how to make wine?

167
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:30,760
- Yeah.

168
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:33,360
They know how to make wine. - You have to explain.

169
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:35,360
That can't be all you know about this story.

170
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:36,860
(laughing)

171
00:06:36,860 --> 00:06:38,560
- They have wine stuffing up their stuff.

172
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:40,080
What are you talking about?

173
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:42,960
- No, they just, they make wine.

174
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:44,760
- You just, you keep saying they make wine.

175
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:45,920
They make wine.

176
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:46,740
- Okay.

177
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:48,240
- Can we listen and explain it right now?

178
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:49,080
You have a really weird article.

179
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:53,000
- Give us a box explainer about a monkey that makes wine

180
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,120
and maybe I'll believe you, maybe.

181
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:57,120
'Cause I'm not too trustful of the news.

182
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:59,040
Also, I'm not sure that would be honest.

183
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:04,040
- Okay, okay, so here's an article from vinepear.com

184
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:07,680
And it says monkeys and chimpanzees are making their own wine.

185
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:14,340
And they extract sap from the raffia palm trees.

186
00:07:14,340 --> 00:07:16,940
They let it ferment, creating a palm wine,

187
00:07:16,940 --> 00:07:22,040
which is similar to how we let grapes ferment to make regular wine.

188
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:25,880
So they make a wine and then they use a leaf sponge.

189
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:30,200
A leaf absorbs the sap and then they sip it almost like a cup.

190
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:32,880
And there's a video

191
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:39,860
Well, that's very very sweet. We could only show the video work, but what do you watch it and recreate it with stuff in your room?

192
00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:47,160
Scooping what looks like why I guess I could be construed as scooping wine into your mouth

193
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:55,560
No, I was watching the video and recreating it he's got like

194
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:03,320
You never I've never really realized how much you look like a monkey

195
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:07,360
Monkey arms and hands

196
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:13,480
You're my most ape-like friend. Yeah, you kind of are you see you're kind of a mix

197
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:20,380
Yeah, monkey and ape of monkey and human. Mm-hmm. Well, thank you. Yeah

198
00:08:20,380 --> 00:08:23,240
I do like to pick things up with my feet

199
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:29,380
I think it's a play really fucking good at that and if we're gonna have a competition about that next we can do that

200
00:08:29,380 --> 00:08:32,560
I used to be able to control the remote can

201
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:37,440
Timmy Timmy remote my own kind of remote that I invented that works with your feet

202
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:42,680
The Alexa's going off again. I think I can control your Alexa with your feet

203
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:49,760
The last thing I controlled my feet was probably my phone to watch stick dog

204
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:52,260
I was just scrolling through TikTok with my phone.

205
00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:53,840
- What? - That is insane.

206
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:55,480
- You can't even see it, it's so far away.

207
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:56,600
You're a tall guy too.

208
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:57,960
- Yes, I can.

209
00:08:57,960 --> 00:08:58,800
- Well, if I was like you,

210
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:00,080
I'd drop it on your face.

211
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:02,520
- Whoa, okay.

212
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:04,360
- Wait, how did you imagine this, Rex?

213
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:05,180
You thought he had it,

214
00:09:05,180 --> 00:09:06,640
you thought he was laying down on the bed?

215
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:08,200
- Yeah, he's laying down. - Holding his bed,

216
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:10,160
holding it with one foot,

217
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:12,200
and then swiping with the other.

218
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:14,400
- So, Rex still thinks,

219
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:15,720
he's still thinking about monkeys,

220
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:17,320
and monkey-like experience. - I think he is.

221
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:18,800
I think he is thinking about monkey stuff.

222
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:23,360
The phone is on the floor and I'm just scrolling with my toe.

223
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:24,400
And it's actually quite easy.

224
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:25,240
You can do the--

225
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:27,640
- Okay, so here's my question for you.

226
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:28,720
- I can take a picture.

227
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:30,960
- What situation are you in there

228
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:32,480
where your hands are full,

229
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:35,120
but you absolutely have to be scrolling TikTok right now?

230
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:37,320
- Toilet, toilet situation.

231
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:39,040
- You have both hands full while you take a shit?

232
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:39,880
What's going on?

233
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:42,360
- He's wiping with both hands 'cause of his huge hole.

234
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:44,360
- I believe that.

235
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:46,140
- He's just rapid firing.

236
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:52,120
- He's taking a towel and he's just running it through like this.

237
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:57,680
- You've both been talking all this big game about your feet activities.

238
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:00,960
I have demonstrable proof that I can take a picture with my foot.

239
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:02,320
- That's not demonstrable.

240
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:04,000
We can't see the bottom part of your desk.

241
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,360
There could be a person down there.

242
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:06,680
You could hire a photographer.

243
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:09,200
- I am currently winning the monkey competition, by the way.

244
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:12,240
So, unless one of you in the next 50 or so minutes can...

245
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:13,080
- How are you winning?

246
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:15,400
Rex looks exactly like a fucking monkey.

247
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:16,760
He wins.

248
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:18,760
Okay, he's trying to do something with his feet now.

249
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:21,480
This is not good radio.

250
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:24,280
This is the worst possible radio that you could do.

251
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:25,880
Okay, do something monkey-like.

252
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:27,200
Right now.

253
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:31,240
I can do something maybe for the audio listeners that is monkey-esque.

254
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:32,480
Okay, go ahead.

255
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:41,440
Is this supposed to be fucking difficult?

256
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:46,680
Is this supposed to be fucking difficult to fucking use your toe fingers?

257
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:48,680
To press buttons made for...

258
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:50,680
No, you placed it on the floor with your hands. It doesn't count.

259
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:54,680
No, don't do it again, Rex.

260
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:56,680
We've got enough of this.

261
00:10:56,680 --> 00:10:58,680
There's plenty of this being done today.

262
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:00,680
Whoa!

263
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:02,680
He carried the phone!

264
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:08,680
This is incredible, Randy. I don't know what you're talking about.

265
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:10,680
He carried the phone for people listening.

266
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:12,680
He carried the phone with his foot.

267
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:14,680
That was really something.

268
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:19,840
No, he's stuck in two chairs, and now he's stuck and have to call the fire department

269
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:22,840
great

270
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:26,960
I think what scares me about that wine story Rex is still going

271
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:31,580
What scares me about that wine story the most yeah?

272
00:11:31,580 --> 00:11:34,560
It almost seems like the monkeys are evolving right before our very eyes

273
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:40,440
It does make it seem as though the monkeys have tasted both our beers and our dinner wines

274
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:46,800
Something disrupt and they have decided to just part and do the they're like empty towels type types

275
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:50,940
Situation but with monkeys going their own way. Yeah monkeys going there on wine

276
00:11:50,940 --> 00:11:57,960
Okay, you're making that face and all the fucking foot you look crazy

277
00:11:57,960 --> 00:12:08,160
You can't see the foot it doesn't there's no credit on the bottom right foot

278
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:11,320
New monkey challenge post that on Twitter with all your feet

279
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:31,800
No, you know we can all jump how about that right you start

280
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:37,560
No, this is jump in slow motion

281
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:39,560
the

282
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:41,560
the

283
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:43,560
the

284
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:45,560
the

285
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:47,560
the

286
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:49,560
the

287
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:51,560
the

288
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:53,560
the

289
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:55,560
the

290
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:57,560
the

291
00:12:57,560 --> 00:12:59,560
the

292
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:01,560
the

293
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:03,560
the

294
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:05,560
the

295
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:06,920
He has gone insane.

296
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:08,840
What's going on with you, you motherfucker?

297
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:09,640
Yeah, what's going on?

298
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:11,640
How's your week going?

299
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:12,200
It's good.

300
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:18,160
I'm just, you know, working, spending time with my girlfriend

301
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:19,240
who is staying with me.

302
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:22,400
So that's why I haven't been gaming as much.

303
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:26,280
We need to eliminate every girlfriend in all of our lives.

304
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:27,160
I know.

305
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:29,080
I do hate sharing a bed with my girlfriend.

306
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:31,040
She's always so restless.

307
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:34,480
I'm asleep in the bed for about two hours,

308
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,280
and then I wake up to pee and I go sleep on the couch

309
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:37,960
the rest of the night kind of guy.

310
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:38,800
- Really?

311
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:40,480
- Yeah, 'cause I want the symbolism of,

312
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:42,480
I go to bed, I wanna be going to sleep

313
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:43,800
in the same bed as my wife,

314
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:46,760
but she really is a fucking complete monster

315
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:48,360
who farts and-- - A monster?

316
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:49,600
- Is, yeah.

317
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:52,840
The other thing is, man, people are too,

318
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:54,960
women are too warm when they sleep.

319
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:56,760
- They are. - Get the fuck away from me.

320
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:58,200
You warm bitch. - They don't know how to

321
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:03,160
respect boundaries and they are really annoying at night.

322
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:05,760
And also, they talk too much.

323
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:07,240
- True, I agree.

324
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:08,080
- Nope.

325
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:10,000
- They talk way too much.

326
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,640
- I'm actually really jealous of your situation.

327
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:13,560
I can't do that right now.

328
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:14,400
- Why's that?

329
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:15,560
- It's so hot down here.

330
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:18,840
Like, the climate is so fucking hot.

331
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:21,160
If I thought about sleeping on the couch

332
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:24,000
for a single night, I would probably just die.

333
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:24,840
- Why?

334
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:25,960
- Through how long I'm sitting here.

335
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:26,880
- Oh, okay.

336
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:28,880
So your bedroom's the only one with AC?

337
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:30,960
- Yeah, basically.

338
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:33,080
- You don't have a fan in your living room?

339
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:34,780
I do, but the air is just hot.

340
00:14:34,780 --> 00:14:36,120
It's just hot air.

341
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:36,620
Yeah.

342
00:14:36,620 --> 00:14:38,320
The entire apartment.

343
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:40,580
You should get a second AC unit.

344
00:14:40,580 --> 00:14:41,260
Yeah.

345
00:14:41,260 --> 00:14:44,520
See, my AC unit, my bedroom has no windows,

346
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:46,020
completely windowless room.

347
00:14:46,020 --> 00:14:46,520
Yeah.

348
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:48,660
And it's easily the hottest part of the house.

349
00:14:48,660 --> 00:14:51,660
The couch is cold.

350
00:14:51,660 --> 00:14:52,160
Yeah.

351
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:54,740
Also, your apartment is, no offense,

352
00:14:54,740 --> 00:14:57,640
the smallest apartment in the entire world.

353
00:14:57,640 --> 00:14:59,400
I've seen much smaller apartments.

354
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:02,280
I knew a guy who lived in a fucking one by one by one.

355
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:05,280
Really? He just stood up a cube.

356
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:07,740
He lived in a microcube.

357
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:09,920
Yeah, that's interesting.

358
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:14,540
Yeah, but our living room is like a little it's it's big

359
00:15:14,540 --> 00:15:18,160
and there's an AC unit there, but it's like a really small one.

360
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:20,420
So it wouldn't it would be dumb to turn it off.

361
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:25,640
It costs $30 to get a fan and have it blow directly onto you.

362
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:27,600
It's it's.

363
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:29,000
But it's blowing hot air.

364
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:29,840
You're misunderstanding.

365
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:30,800
It's blowing completely hot.

366
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:32,140
It's hot, humid air.

367
00:15:32,140 --> 00:15:33,440
If it's grass.

368
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:36,200
You're from the dry, dry parts of this world.

369
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:40,940
Me and Julio were raised in the Amazon jungle of sorts.

370
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:45,140
Me, Wilmington, him, Mexico, where it is humid and it is green

371
00:15:45,140 --> 00:15:46,940
and it is mean.

372
00:15:46,940 --> 00:15:49,280
The first house I lived in.

373
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:51,280
The first house I lived in.

374
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:52,140
Was it the jungle?

375
00:15:52,140 --> 00:15:54,300
Didn't have any AC in my room.

376
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:57,940
It was not in the jungle, but it didn't have any AC.

377
00:15:57,940 --> 00:16:01,340
It got about 95 degrees in there during the day.

378
00:16:01,340 --> 00:16:06,840
I would sit directly in front of the fan in nothing but my underwear.

379
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:09,700
Yeah. And just stew.

380
00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:11,400
And I could sleep just fine in there.

381
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:15,340
You do understand how much more comfortable that is other than just staying

382
00:16:15,340 --> 00:16:18,140
in the bedroom with an AC unit

383
00:16:18,140 --> 00:16:21,240
that's blowing nice cold air?

384
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:28,780
Well, no, I don't know, because I experience AC at all times as a

385
00:16:28,780 --> 00:16:30,580
civilized first world person.

386
00:16:30,580 --> 00:16:32,080
Wow.

387
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:34,480
I just have a window unit, man.

388
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:36,380
Do you have you have central air in the house?

389
00:16:36,380 --> 00:16:38,680
That's nice, man.

390
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:39,580
Yeah.

391
00:16:39,580 --> 00:16:42,180
Yeah, it's all about to change.

392
00:16:42,180 --> 00:16:45,580
So, yeah, that's true.

393
00:16:45,580 --> 00:16:47,880
The place I'm looking at has central air.

394
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:49,780
We're going to change your life.

395
00:16:49,780 --> 00:16:52,220
I didn't even realize, I'm such a fool.

396
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:56,060
Growing up in the South, I didn't even realize that places didn't have central air.

397
00:16:56,060 --> 00:16:56,860
Yeah.

398
00:16:56,860 --> 00:17:00,220
I didn't even know when people said central air, I didn't even know what that meant.

399
00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:04,540
Because if you don't have air conditioning in the South, you just die.

400
00:17:04,540 --> 00:17:05,380
Mm-hmm.

401
00:17:05,380 --> 00:17:07,700
It's so, so hot there.

402
00:17:07,700 --> 00:17:10,980
It'll be a hundred degrees with a hundred percent humidity.

403
00:17:10,980 --> 00:17:13,340
And you just feel like you're drowning.

404
00:17:13,340 --> 00:17:14,260
Yeah.

405
00:17:14,260 --> 00:17:15,220
It's not pleasant.

406
00:17:15,220 --> 00:17:17,020
No, it's a bad place to live.

407
00:17:17,020 --> 00:17:19,620
So this is my situation at the moment.

408
00:17:19,620 --> 00:17:25,540
it's it's not pleasant to be outside of the AC rooms now it's not fine

409
00:17:25,540 --> 00:17:33,020
not fine I need rescuing I did white rescuing I would wait for you know I do

410
00:17:33,020 --> 00:17:37,500
we could do it I do sometimes think about adopting you

411
00:17:40,220 --> 00:17:42,380
- A visa?

412
00:17:42,380 --> 00:17:43,220
- Yeah, I have a visa.

413
00:17:43,220 --> 00:17:44,060
- That's your credit.

414
00:17:44,060 --> 00:17:45,780
- I have a traveler's visa.

415
00:17:45,780 --> 00:17:46,740
I have good credit.

416
00:17:46,740 --> 00:17:50,180
- Well, I think that you would need,

417
00:17:50,180 --> 00:17:52,940
I think you'd need an excuse to go to America

418
00:17:52,940 --> 00:17:54,100
for a long time.

419
00:17:54,100 --> 00:17:55,660
So it would need to be something like,

420
00:17:55,660 --> 00:17:56,500
you know what you could do?

421
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:57,980
You could join the American Army.

422
00:17:57,980 --> 00:17:58,820
- Mm.

423
00:17:58,820 --> 00:18:02,300
- I don't wanna do that.

424
00:18:02,300 --> 00:18:04,700
I wouldn't wanna stay at home and play a game.

425
00:18:04,700 --> 00:18:07,140
That's what I wanna do.

426
00:18:07,140 --> 00:18:07,960
I would wanna stay at home and play a game.

427
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:08,980
- That's what you do in the military.

428
00:18:08,980 --> 00:18:10,980
But you do it with 40 or 50 friends.

429
00:18:10,980 --> 00:18:18,420
No, then I have to like go out there in like the jungle or some shit and talk about how cool it is that I'm...

430
00:18:18,420 --> 00:18:22,380
The jungle? You think the military goes to the jungle?

431
00:18:22,380 --> 00:18:26,820
Well, they gotta stop these monkeys from inventing nuclear bombs next, dude.

432
00:18:26,820 --> 00:18:28,980
Yeah, they got monkey Oppenheimers.

433
00:18:28,980 --> 00:18:33,540
Yeah, there's gonna be some kind of industrial revolution with the monkeys.

434
00:18:34,020 --> 00:18:36,660
where they're doing 2x4 technology,

435
00:18:36,660 --> 00:18:39,460
shooting bananas with rubber bands at people.

436
00:18:39,460 --> 00:18:41,740
That kind of stuff actually scares me.

437
00:18:41,740 --> 00:18:42,580
- Yeah.

438
00:18:42,580 --> 00:18:48,500
I've become a destroyer of trees.

439
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:50,500
- No, they don't destroy trees, Mike.

440
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:51,340
- They live on the trees.

441
00:18:51,340 --> 00:18:52,340
- They will, they will.

442
00:18:52,340 --> 00:18:53,620
They're destroying trees.

443
00:18:53,620 --> 00:18:54,780
- Why would they destroy trees?

444
00:18:54,780 --> 00:18:55,820
- With their monkey bombs.

445
00:18:55,820 --> 00:18:56,720
- For attention?

446
00:18:56,720 --> 00:19:01,060
- No, for a war, purposes of war.

447
00:19:01,060 --> 00:19:02,420
Haven't you listened to the Tool songs?

448
00:19:02,420 --> 00:19:04,580
- Crazy, the big wars. - The Tool Song?

449
00:19:04,580 --> 00:19:05,960
- Which Tool Song? - Monkey fighting monkey

450
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:07,660
over pieces of the ground?

451
00:19:07,660 --> 00:19:09,780
- Is there monkey racism? - Wow.

452
00:19:09,780 --> 00:19:10,740
- Oh yeah.

453
00:19:10,740 --> 00:19:11,780
- Are you kidding?

454
00:19:11,780 --> 00:19:12,620
- Of course.

455
00:19:12,620 --> 00:19:15,160
- It's like they're awful to each other.

456
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:17,420
- Yeah, and that's what the Bunky Bombs are for.

457
00:19:17,420 --> 00:19:20,580
- The apes eat the monkeys, so apes will--

458
00:19:20,580 --> 00:19:21,860
Yeah, so apes will--

459
00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:23,420
No, it's true.

460
00:19:23,420 --> 00:19:26,900
There's video of apes running into a monkey sanctuary.

461
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:29,260
- Do apes eat monkeys?

462
00:19:29,260 --> 00:19:31,620
- They do, and they'll eat their brains

463
00:19:31,620 --> 00:19:32,820
and rip their heads off.

464
00:19:32,820 --> 00:19:33,660
- Yeah.

465
00:19:33,660 --> 00:19:35,900
- They're monkey fighting. - What?

466
00:19:35,900 --> 00:19:37,900
- Yeah, they're like, they're predatory.

467
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:38,740
- Whoa!

468
00:19:38,740 --> 00:19:39,780
- On monkeys. - That's crazy.

469
00:19:39,780 --> 00:19:41,660
I just saw some crazy pictures.

470
00:19:41,660 --> 00:19:42,500
- Yeah, you don't wanna see these pictures.

471
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:43,420
- Okay, I believe you.

472
00:19:43,420 --> 00:19:44,260
- No. - They rip up,

473
00:19:44,260 --> 00:19:46,420
they eat children, monkey children,

474
00:19:46,420 --> 00:19:47,740
baby monkey children.

475
00:19:47,740 --> 00:19:48,660
- Monkey children?

476
00:19:48,660 --> 00:19:50,240
- Aye-aye from-- - I hate monkey children.

477
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:51,460
- Super Monkey Ball.

478
00:19:51,460 --> 00:19:52,380
- Yeah. - They do that thing.

479
00:19:52,380 --> 00:19:57,240
If you put a chimp in Super Monkey Ball,

480
00:19:57,240 --> 00:19:58,820
he's breaking into those balls,

481
00:19:58,820 --> 00:20:00,420
he's ripping their arms off. - Isn't that Gongon?

482
00:20:00,420 --> 00:20:02,220
- Isn't GonGon a chimp?

483
00:20:02,220 --> 00:20:03,260
- He's a gorilla.

484
00:20:03,260 --> 00:20:04,100
- A gorilla?

485
00:20:04,100 --> 00:20:06,180
- Well, if he was a realistic chimp,

486
00:20:06,180 --> 00:20:08,020
then he would be doing that.

487
00:20:08,020 --> 00:20:09,820
You know, gorillas actually aren't even that,

488
00:20:09,820 --> 00:20:12,580
gorillas aren't very aggressive.

489
00:20:12,580 --> 00:20:14,020
They're territorial, but not aggressive.

490
00:20:14,020 --> 00:20:18,100
I would rather be stuck in a neutral place

491
00:20:18,100 --> 00:20:22,620
with a gorilla than a chimpanzee, personally.

492
00:20:22,620 --> 00:20:23,640
- Yeah.

493
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:24,480
- They have the smallest penis.

494
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:26,300
- Chimpanzees are the ones that just fucking

495
00:20:26,300 --> 00:20:27,700
rip people's faces off, right?

496
00:20:27,700 --> 00:20:30,900
- Yeah, chimps will just go insane for no reason.

497
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:33,220
Gorillas will just, yeah, also people don't realize,

498
00:20:33,220 --> 00:20:35,780
a gorilla's like five foot one.

499
00:20:35,780 --> 00:20:38,580
Gorillas are not that big, they're big.

500
00:20:38,580 --> 00:20:39,860
But they're not like--

501
00:20:39,860 --> 00:20:41,860
- Yeah, but they're strong. - Like towering over you.

502
00:20:41,860 --> 00:20:42,680
You, whatever.

503
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:45,220
- They're like-- - Whatever.

504
00:20:45,220 --> 00:20:46,060
- Yeah, they're like kilo size.

505
00:20:46,060 --> 00:20:48,140
- Haven't you ever seen like a really short guy

506
00:20:48,140 --> 00:20:50,340
at the gym that's just like ripped?

507
00:20:50,340 --> 00:20:53,060
- Yes, actually, the owner of the gym that I go to.

508
00:20:53,060 --> 00:20:54,980
The owner of the gym that I go to

509
00:20:54,980 --> 00:20:59,980
is this like five foot three, 250 pound pure muscle guy.

510
00:20:59,980 --> 00:21:03,580
And the other day he was going to do dumbbell bench press,

511
00:21:03,580 --> 00:21:04,500
like with dumbbells.

512
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:07,580
And he had 120 pound dumbbell in each hand.

513
00:21:07,580 --> 00:21:09,860
And some random fucking guy was sitting there

514
00:21:09,860 --> 00:21:13,740
and he was like, "Hey you, tell me I can't do this."

515
00:21:13,740 --> 00:21:14,580
And he was like, "What?"

516
00:21:14,580 --> 00:21:16,980
And he's like, "Tell me I don't have this shit."

517
00:21:16,980 --> 00:21:17,820
- Damn.

518
00:21:17,820 --> 00:21:18,660
- And oh my God.

519
00:21:18,660 --> 00:21:20,460
- That's all he needed.

520
00:21:20,460 --> 00:21:21,620
- But yeah, and he was like,

521
00:21:21,620 --> 00:21:23,060
"Okay, you don't have this."

522
00:21:23,060 --> 00:21:24,340
He was like, "Say it louder."

523
00:21:24,340 --> 00:21:26,340
He was like, "You don't have this shit.

524
00:21:26,340 --> 00:21:27,940
You can't get this.

525
00:21:27,940 --> 00:21:29,260
You can't get that."

526
00:21:29,260 --> 00:21:30,820
- You can't even reach the pussy.

527
00:21:30,820 --> 00:21:32,700
- And then he did some of the worst reps

528
00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:34,060
I've ever seen in my life.

529
00:21:34,060 --> 00:21:37,420
He was like moving his arm this much up and down.

530
00:21:37,420 --> 00:21:38,260
- You know what?

531
00:21:38,260 --> 00:21:39,180
- But he's huge.

532
00:21:39,180 --> 00:21:40,020
What am I to say?

533
00:21:40,020 --> 00:21:40,840
What am I to criticize?

534
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:41,980
- I'm not gonna blame him.

535
00:21:41,980 --> 00:21:43,860
I'm gonna place the blame on the guy

536
00:21:43,860 --> 00:21:46,940
who was such a pussy at intimidating this guy

537
00:21:46,940 --> 00:21:47,780
or like getting him fired up.

538
00:21:47,780 --> 00:21:51,420
- I'm gonna say that that guy has a little penis

539
00:21:52,620 --> 00:21:56,780
and that he wants women to bully him for it.

540
00:21:56,780 --> 00:22:00,260
You want him to, you think he gets his things stepped on?

541
00:22:00,260 --> 00:22:01,140
Yeah.

542
00:22:01,140 --> 00:22:02,540
That is a big red high heel.

543
00:22:02,540 --> 00:22:03,180
Yep.

544
00:22:03,180 --> 00:22:06,140
That is also, how do you figure that out?

545
00:22:06,140 --> 00:22:06,940
How do you figure it out though?

546
00:22:06,940 --> 00:22:07,580
You like that?

547
00:22:07,580 --> 00:22:09,780
What situation are you ever on?

548
00:22:09,780 --> 00:22:12,340
Like you get stepped on your balls and you're like, wait a minute.

549
00:22:12,340 --> 00:22:13,700
I can see that.

550
00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:19,940
I think you just watch some videos related to that topic and you're like, hmm, this

551
00:22:19,940 --> 00:22:20,780
interests me.

552
00:22:20,780 --> 00:22:21,220
No.

553
00:22:21,220 --> 00:22:23,220
- What if you get it, what if you,

554
00:22:23,220 --> 00:22:26,460
no, no, I think you get your dick stuck in a doorframe one day

555
00:22:26,460 --> 00:22:30,060
and it gets slammed in there and you go like, "Ah, wait."

556
00:22:30,060 --> 00:22:30,900
- Hold on.

557
00:22:30,900 --> 00:22:32,740
- Yeah, hold, wait, hold the phone.

558
00:22:32,740 --> 00:22:34,460
I actually kind of enjoy that.

559
00:22:34,460 --> 00:22:36,180
- Yeah, what if something happened,

560
00:22:36,180 --> 00:22:39,340
it's one of those situations where someone growing up,

561
00:22:39,340 --> 00:22:42,180
they got their, someone just kicked their balls.

562
00:22:42,180 --> 00:22:43,060
- Oh yeah.

563
00:22:43,060 --> 00:22:45,300
- And then 20 years later, it's like,

564
00:22:45,300 --> 00:22:49,060
actually, I kind of, I'm into that now.

565
00:22:49,060 --> 00:22:52,520
- I mean, it would be cool if your balls got kicked

566
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:54,740
and you just nutted instantly.

567
00:22:54,740 --> 00:22:57,240
'Cause that would be much better than the regular.

568
00:22:57,240 --> 00:22:58,280
(laughing)

569
00:22:58,280 --> 00:23:00,120
- I've always said this, dude.

570
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:01,160
- Your balls get kicked, which is you just go,

571
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:03,000
"Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow."

572
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,400
- I've said this my entire life.

573
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:05,600
I remember thinking this the first time

574
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:07,240
I ever got kicked in the balls.

575
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:09,000
I wish that made me nut.

576
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:09,840
- Right.

577
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:10,660
- It is kind of crazy.

578
00:23:10,660 --> 00:23:14,300
I haven't been hit in the balls in some time.

579
00:23:14,300 --> 00:23:16,040
Probably over a year since I got hit in the balls,

580
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:17,480
but I feel like growing up,

581
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:22,400
my balls were massacred day in and day out.

582
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:25,920
Not just by like friends and brothers,

583
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:27,520
but by like the environment.

584
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:29,560
I was hitting corners with my balls.

585
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:33,760
- You're too tall to hit your balls on the table now.

586
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:34,600
- Well, that's true.

587
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:36,080
That's a good point.

588
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:38,880
- You just hurt your leg now.

589
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:40,480
- Yeah, but I haven't been hitting the ball.

590
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:42,540
I feel like it's a good kind of reset though.

591
00:23:42,540 --> 00:23:43,880
Maybe I need that soon.

592
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:47,920
- I remember Pat hitting you in the balls

593
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:50,000
and then cowering for a day.

594
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,280
He's such a coward.

595
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:52,840
He's such a coward.

596
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:53,640
For a whole day.

597
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:55,920
Yeah, after, for the revenge.

598
00:23:55,920 --> 00:24:01,000
I fight with him in the exact way that I fight with my little brother, which is I,

599
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:08,560
they do something to me and I think about doing, I think about doing so, so, yeah,

600
00:24:08,560 --> 00:24:12,680
something so over the top, over the line, way overreaction to them.

601
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:20,700
But, you know, I do ASMR a lot of the times and binaural beats and Headspace, the app.

602
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:25,200
So eventually I'm able to center myself and say, you know, man, it's not worth it.

603
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:30,560
And I'll say this, that is a more affecting thing than attacking them and

604
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:34,800
maybe stealing their wallet is if you just say, you turn the other cheek.

605
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:36,180
Yeah.

606
00:24:36,180 --> 00:24:38,040
I've never had this experience.

607
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:43,160
If you turn the other cheek to me, I would just do that.

608
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:44,360
I'd probably touch it.

609
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:45,960
You just touch my cheek?

610
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:47,960
Yeah, your other cheek.

611
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:50,360
In like a before sunrise kind of way?

612
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:52,360
Yeah, just really tenderly.

613
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:53,560
Like kind of caress it?

614
00:24:53,560 --> 00:24:54,360
Yeah.

615
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:56,760
I kind of miss fighting with my brothers.

616
00:24:56,760 --> 00:25:00,160
It's such a nice thing to have a food chain.

617
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:05,160
Yeah, I think this is where our lived experiences are going to differ a lot

618
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:06,160
because you have brothers.

619
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:07,160
Oh, you're Mexican.

620
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:09,360
I only had sisters.

621
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:11,360
Rex has an only child.

622
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:12,560
I do.

623
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:15,860
- I forget that, you so don't strike me as an only child.

624
00:25:15,860 --> 00:25:19,280
- I know, it's 'cause my parents are retarded, so.

625
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:22,420
- Well, I feel like that's, I admit that as a compliment.

626
00:25:22,420 --> 00:25:24,280
- No, I know, I'm saying it's like, you know,

627
00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:26,640
like an only child is like usually spoiled

628
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:29,080
'cause it's like the only child.

629
00:25:29,080 --> 00:25:30,000
- Child.

630
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,120
- Right, you know, they don't have to share anything,

631
00:25:32,120 --> 00:25:32,960
they don't get anything.

632
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:36,800
My parents, Jewish, so I just, you know,

633
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:39,040
I was just sharing nothing,

634
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:40,120
but there was nothing to share anyway.

635
00:25:40,120 --> 00:25:42,240
- You had nothing to share.

636
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:47,840
Yeah, they didn't have like, you know, they'd be like, "We can't afford that."

637
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:48,840
Oh, yeah.

638
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:49,840
Oh, I'm sorry, man.

639
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:50,840
No, it's okay.

640
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:51,840
I think it's a good experience to grow up with.

641
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:52,840
Oh, you didn't get toys.

642
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:56,840
I'm sorry that you grew up in the slums of Arizona.

643
00:25:56,840 --> 00:25:59,000
I didn't grow up in the slums.

644
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,360
Parents did fine for themselves.

645
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:02,280
They just didn't give me anything.

646
00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:03,280
And that's...

647
00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:04,280
Well...

648
00:26:04,280 --> 00:26:06,720
You put AC in your room, so you spent every single day...

649
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:09,720
No, that was after I moved out.

650
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:12,720
I had when I paid $300 a month for rent.

651
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:18,040
Yeah, because it's hard to forget that somebody with Jewish parents is also Jewish.

652
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:19,040
Right.

653
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:20,040
Yeah.

654
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:22,440
Well, I was just broke, you know.

655
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:26,340
I don't think you, you shouldn't really move out of your parents' house and then immediately

656
00:26:26,340 --> 00:26:27,340
have a nice apartment.

657
00:26:27,340 --> 00:26:29,720
You need to struggle for a little bit.

658
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:33,480
My first apartment after I moved out of my parents' house was, I paid more than I do

659
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:34,480
here.

660
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:35,480
It was in Boston.

661
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:36,480
Really?

662
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:37,480
Yeah, when I was going to college.

663
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:39,840
It was $1,000 a month.

664
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:47,600
We didn't have a living room, so we put a couch in the hallway and we had rats that lived in

665
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:48,600
the apartment.

666
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:50,600
Not mice, big ass rats.

667
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:51,600
Jesus.

668
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:53,520
It was the worst place.

669
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:59,480
And I was so broke I paid rent late every single month because I got behind one month.

670
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:03,120
And so the cycle of money that I had for my job just...

671
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:06,920
So I actually paid $1,100 a month for this fucking terrible apartment.

672
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:10,160
35 Brookline Street, Central Square, Cambridge.

673
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:14,500
But I live near a Target where I could steal all the cheese I wanted to.

674
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:17,940
Whoa. And then you shared it with the rats who also paid rent.

675
00:27:17,940 --> 00:27:22,700
I do. I think I've told this on something before, but we had the rats

676
00:27:22,700 --> 00:27:24,980
and we're like, Jesus Christ, there's fucking rats everywhere.

677
00:27:24,980 --> 00:27:26,440
This is the worst place ever.

678
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:28,780
And I lived with Neil at the time.

679
00:27:28,780 --> 00:27:31,320
And one day we see turn on his.

680
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:34,480
He's the only person with AC who turned on his AC when he was gone

681
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:39,600
and just open all the doors and try to get the house as cool as possible.

682
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:45,340
And one day I went in there to turn on his AC and it was like the peak of the rat problem.

683
00:27:45,340 --> 00:27:51,640
And he had like four or five plates sitting around his room with different slices of cheese,

684
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:53,240
like a Tom and Jerry.

685
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:57,080
Like they would walk out and be like, "Oh!" and like swim in it and like do backstroke.

686
00:27:57,080 --> 00:28:03,840
That was the cheese smorgasbord that he left for the mice or the rats in his room.

687
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:05,840
Wait, so he did that on purpose?

688
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:11,240
No, he just like that fucker just likes cheese, and he would fall asleep eating cheese in his bed.

689
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:17,400
I see, I wonder why he had a problem then. Do you think they had sort of like a

690
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:22,480
like a mutant ninja turtle situation where you became kind of like a mouse

691
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:27,920
living in this apartment? You turned into a radioactive rat?

692
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:34,400
Yeah, I would say I have significantly cut back on my mice like activities

693
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:40,160
Okay, I eat a half a block of sharp Dublin cheddar today

694
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:46,740
Yeah, I did but it was with honey, and I dare you to give a mice honey. I think my sake honey

695
00:28:46,740 --> 00:28:49,700
I think they're like sweet thing. Well. I don't know that much about mice

696
00:28:49,700 --> 00:28:54,440
Well you shouldn't know I shouldn't because I'm not one

697
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:57,640
Don't say ask your parents. Don't say

698
00:28:57,640 --> 00:29:02,640
- I think you would discover too many truths about yourself

699
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:04,560
if you learned about mice.

700
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:06,760
- Got ancestry.com and they were just like,

701
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:10,440
30% of rat DNA.

702
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:14,520
- Let's look up mice attributes.

703
00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:16,080
- What do mice like?

704
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:16,920
- Yep, they have mice.

705
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:18,520
- No, I think this is stupid.

706
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:20,840
It's gonna be like, they have a tail.

707
00:29:20,840 --> 00:29:22,840
They have gray fur.

708
00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:24,680
- No, no, no, no, if I'm such a mouse.

709
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:25,520
- Look at the cartoons.

710
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:26,340
- It's so funny.

711
00:29:26,340 --> 00:29:27,660
Let's do this, okay?

712
00:29:27,660 --> 00:29:30,780
Mice have a slender body, wait.

713
00:29:30,780 --> 00:29:32,220
- You do have a slender body.

714
00:29:32,220 --> 00:29:33,060
- Kind of like that.

715
00:29:33,060 --> 00:29:34,980
- They're small, like a mouse.

716
00:29:34,980 --> 00:29:36,260
- Scantily haired.

717
00:29:36,260 --> 00:29:38,940
Prominent ears.

718
00:29:38,940 --> 00:29:41,180
(laughing)

719
00:29:41,180 --> 00:29:45,740
Thinly furred tail, no.

720
00:29:45,740 --> 00:29:48,140
It may be about as long, oh, that's the tail.

721
00:29:48,140 --> 00:29:52,120
I mean, so far it is, if I had to say it,

722
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:55,020
it's pretty similar to me. - Like 30%.

723
00:29:55,020 --> 00:29:57,460
Okay, let's look up mice diet though.

724
00:29:57,460 --> 00:29:59,900
Mice diet.

725
00:29:59,900 --> 00:30:02,340
- Yeah, what do mice actually eat?

726
00:30:02,340 --> 00:30:03,180
- Anything.

727
00:30:03,180 --> 00:30:05,340
- Seeds, grains, and other plant material,

728
00:30:05,340 --> 00:30:09,820
as well as invertebrates, small vertebrates, and carrion.

729
00:30:09,820 --> 00:30:11,280
God, I love carrion.

730
00:30:11,280 --> 00:30:13,260
I don't know what that is.

731
00:30:13,260 --> 00:30:14,500
- That shit's yum.

732
00:30:14,500 --> 00:30:15,820
- That shit is yummers.

733
00:30:15,820 --> 00:30:16,660
- That shit is yummers.

734
00:30:16,660 --> 00:30:18,660
- I think that is all of you.

735
00:30:18,660 --> 00:30:19,780
That is exactly you.

736
00:30:19,780 --> 00:30:20,620
You've been describing.

737
00:30:20,620 --> 00:30:22,020
- Ugh, I hate to say it,

738
00:30:22,020 --> 00:30:26,920
They say chocolate is hands-down a mice's a mouse's favorite followed closely that I buy peanut butter

739
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:31,120
Well, I basically just had a chocolate yogurt. So some cheese

740
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:34,300
That's actually a myth

741
00:30:34,300 --> 00:30:40,180
Yeah, that's a cartoon misconception. You've you fell for Hollywood's lies. Yeah, what might actually hate cheese

742
00:30:40,180 --> 00:30:43,420
They're allergic to it

743
00:30:43,420 --> 00:30:47,260
Based on a lie their best friends with cats actually also

744
00:30:48,020 --> 00:30:51,420
They just really hate dogs and they don't speak English

745
00:30:51,420 --> 00:30:54,540
Not a lick of it

746
00:30:54,540 --> 00:30:58,660
They can't sing a French song. Yeah, that's that's Tom

747
00:30:58,660 --> 00:31:05,020
Did he speak English in that show? I thought it was just just them chasing each other the French cousin does

748
00:31:05,020 --> 00:31:12,120
They do occasionally speak but it's very French mouse in the show. You don't know about about Jerry's cousin

749
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:14,660
the French

750
00:31:14,660 --> 00:31:16,660
- He has a sword. - J'ai le French.

751
00:31:16,660 --> 00:31:19,900
(singing in French)

752
00:31:19,900 --> 00:31:20,740
- He sings that song?

753
00:31:20,740 --> 00:31:22,940
- That song sounds familiar.

754
00:31:22,940 --> 00:31:24,380
- Yeah. - Yes, 'cause you remember it

755
00:31:24,380 --> 00:31:25,300
from this cartoon.

756
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:26,140
Nobody's ever heard that song

757
00:31:26,140 --> 00:31:26,960
outside of that cartoon. - Wait, no,

758
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:27,860
he's not French, he's a baby.

759
00:31:27,860 --> 00:31:29,540
He's just a small mouse.

760
00:31:29,540 --> 00:31:31,420
- But he speaks in a French accent

761
00:31:31,420 --> 00:31:32,620
and he sings a French song,

762
00:31:32,620 --> 00:31:34,060
so you tell me who's French.

763
00:31:34,060 --> 00:31:38,460
- I think you are-- - J'ai le...

764
00:31:38,460 --> 00:31:40,340
Tom and J'ai le...

765
00:31:40,340 --> 00:31:41,540
- Tom and J'ai le...

766
00:31:41,540 --> 00:31:42,900
(laughing)

767
00:31:42,900 --> 00:31:44,300
J'ai le...

768
00:31:44,300 --> 00:31:46,620
These are my pets, Tom and Jerry.

769
00:31:46,620 --> 00:31:48,300
I might go to France at the end of the year.

770
00:31:48,300 --> 00:31:50,620
I am not excited.

771
00:31:50,620 --> 00:31:52,020
I don't want to see that place.

772
00:31:52,020 --> 00:31:53,660
I don't want to be anywhere near them.

773
00:31:53,660 --> 00:31:55,380
I think France is cool.

774
00:31:55,380 --> 00:31:58,700
France is a double-edged sword, because a lot of people

775
00:31:58,700 --> 00:32:00,740
either hate it, or they think they're going to love it

776
00:32:00,740 --> 00:32:04,460
and hate it, or they have normal experiences like me,

777
00:32:04,460 --> 00:32:07,860
which I thought it was a really cool place.

778
00:32:07,860 --> 00:32:10,300
The only experience I've ever had with a French guy is,

779
00:32:10,300 --> 00:32:12,540
my wife has a French uncle.

780
00:32:12,540 --> 00:32:15,580
And growing up, I mean, like in high school,

781
00:32:15,580 --> 00:32:18,380
when we were first dating, he lived,

782
00:32:18,380 --> 00:32:21,180
they lived in France, but they would come to Christmas

783
00:32:21,180 --> 00:32:23,000
in North Carolina.

784
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:27,220
And every time I saw him, this fucking, this fuck, dude,

785
00:32:27,220 --> 00:32:28,980
every time I saw him, he would be like,

786
00:32:28,980 --> 00:32:33,420
Caleb, you are looking a little bit more potly

787
00:32:33,420 --> 00:32:35,580
and fat than you were last year.

788
00:32:35,580 --> 00:32:36,840
He would like call me fat.

789
00:32:36,840 --> 00:32:38,980
- Yeah.

790
00:32:38,980 --> 00:32:39,820
- What is that?

791
00:32:39,820 --> 00:32:40,660
What kind of guy is he supposed to be?

792
00:32:40,660 --> 00:32:42,360
- That's why you hate France.

793
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:44,020
- I hate the French.

794
00:32:44,020 --> 00:32:44,860
- Okay.

795
00:32:44,860 --> 00:32:45,840
- Yeah. - I hate the French.

796
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:47,380
- I hate that specific French guy.

797
00:32:47,380 --> 00:32:49,180
- You are fat and gay.

798
00:32:49,180 --> 00:32:50,260
He would say this shit to me

799
00:32:50,260 --> 00:32:52,380
like every single time I saw him.

800
00:32:52,380 --> 00:32:53,700
- You look like a mouse.

801
00:32:53,700 --> 00:32:54,780
- He'd be like, "What are you doing?"

802
00:32:54,780 --> 00:32:56,420
And I'd be like, "I'm going to college."

803
00:32:56,420 --> 00:33:00,580
And he'd be like, "No, no, no, no."

804
00:33:00,580 --> 00:33:02,460
I don't even know what that means.

805
00:33:02,460 --> 00:33:03,300
- No?

806
00:33:03,300 --> 00:33:04,140
- Sounds like he was saying no.

807
00:33:04,140 --> 00:33:05,500
- He would say, "No, no, no."

808
00:33:05,500 --> 00:33:07,820
Like I'm supposed to be,

809
00:33:07,820 --> 00:33:09,020
You know what it is, just do this.

810
00:33:09,020 --> 00:33:11,020
France have a caste system.

811
00:33:11,020 --> 00:33:13,660
Maybe he thought that I was like a untouchable,

812
00:33:13,660 --> 00:33:14,820
like I shouldn't.

813
00:33:14,820 --> 00:33:16,980
He just didn't like me specifically.

814
00:33:16,980 --> 00:33:18,620
Well, imagine what that means.

815
00:33:18,620 --> 00:33:22,260
Imagine how hard it is to be fat in France.

816
00:33:22,260 --> 00:33:23,340
He was fucking fat.

817
00:33:23,340 --> 00:33:24,860
That's the worst part.

818
00:33:24,860 --> 00:33:25,740
Really?

819
00:33:25,740 --> 00:33:27,780
Yeah, dude, he was a bowling ball.

820
00:33:27,780 --> 00:33:28,620
Oh my God.

821
00:33:28,620 --> 00:33:30,620
Because he went to America often.

822
00:33:30,620 --> 00:33:31,460
Yeah, true.

823
00:33:31,460 --> 00:33:33,180
He goes once a year for Christmas,

824
00:33:33,180 --> 00:33:35,140
barely the rest of the year.

825
00:33:35,140 --> 00:33:37,100
That is often enough.

826
00:33:37,100 --> 00:33:39,100
I think you maybe like it.

827
00:33:39,100 --> 00:33:41,100
Food is poison.

828
00:33:41,100 --> 00:33:46,100
I do think that it's very, I do see it very possible that you can have one of those experiences where you

829
00:33:46,100 --> 00:33:51,100
either just happen to meet a rude person or just don't enjoy the sights

830
00:33:51,100 --> 00:33:56,100
or just think that Paris is just completely dirty as a city

831
00:33:56,100 --> 00:34:00,100
and you'll just come back and be like, yeah that's just, that's completely bullshit.

832
00:34:00,100 --> 00:34:03,100
You think I might think France is bullshit?

833
00:34:03,100 --> 00:34:05,100
You might think that France is bullshit, yeah.

834
00:34:05,100 --> 00:34:09,500
I like ratatouille. That's an amazing movie. I've seen it probably over a hundred times

835
00:34:09,500 --> 00:34:11,740
Okay

836
00:34:11,740 --> 00:34:13,340
so

837
00:34:13,340 --> 00:34:20,020
Yeah, I think that you're gonna completely like it then yeah, I am more interested in I want to see Italy

838
00:34:20,020 --> 00:34:24,080
I want to go to Milan and Rome and

839
00:34:24,080 --> 00:34:31,520
Couple of other cities that I know in Italy and do what eat food cheese. He's gonna eat

840
00:34:32,020 --> 00:34:34,660
I want to drink all the cheese.

841
00:34:34,660 --> 00:34:35,660
Drink what, wine?

842
00:34:35,660 --> 00:34:38,220
I want to drink everything they have.

843
00:34:38,220 --> 00:34:42,620
A beautiful Amaro's and amazing apertifs

844
00:34:42,620 --> 00:34:45,000
that they have in beautiful Italy.

845
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:49,500
I want to go to the Milan Camparino.

846
00:34:49,500 --> 00:34:51,540
They have a Campari bar there

847
00:34:51,540 --> 00:34:54,180
that's run by the Campari group,

848
00:34:54,180 --> 00:34:57,900
where they do Campari only cocktails.

849
00:34:57,900 --> 00:34:59,640
Didn't Noah tell you that?

850
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:01,580
No, I found this out from a YouTube video.

851
00:35:01,580 --> 00:35:02,580
Thank you very much.

852
00:35:02,580 --> 00:35:05,320
(laughing)

853
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:08,060
'Cause I've seen a lot of YouTube.

854
00:35:08,060 --> 00:35:08,900
- True.

855
00:35:08,900 --> 00:35:10,400
- Would you do one of those like tours

856
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:13,080
where it's just like you and like 30 other people

857
00:35:13,080 --> 00:35:16,820
just in a bus going to like different cities?

858
00:35:16,820 --> 00:35:20,260
- No, I will probably do something very authentic.

859
00:35:20,260 --> 00:35:21,100
- Which is?

860
00:35:21,100 --> 00:35:26,700
- Just, I'll just see if I can find a job,

861
00:35:26,700 --> 00:35:28,380
kind of work there for a week.

862
00:35:28,380 --> 00:35:29,300
- Yeah.

863
00:35:29,300 --> 00:35:30,140
- That kind of thing.

864
00:35:30,140 --> 00:35:32,140
I want the real experience of Italy.

865
00:35:32,140 --> 00:35:35,820
I wanna work in Venice but live two hours away

866
00:35:35,820 --> 00:35:39,780
and I have to commute in to drive up an old boat.

867
00:35:39,780 --> 00:35:41,380
That's the kind of thing that I wanna do.

868
00:35:41,380 --> 00:35:42,220
- I think you should go to Belgium.

869
00:35:42,220 --> 00:35:43,260
- That would be nice.

870
00:35:43,260 --> 00:35:44,820
- Belgium's a beautiful place.

871
00:35:44,820 --> 00:35:46,900
- Fuck that, man.

872
00:35:46,900 --> 00:35:48,180
- Belgium is lovely.

873
00:35:48,180 --> 00:35:49,500
- I wanna go to the beach.

874
00:35:49,500 --> 00:35:52,180
I wanna be sitting on the beach doing super bass stuff.

875
00:35:52,180 --> 00:35:53,300
I don't wanna be in Belgium.

876
00:35:53,300 --> 00:35:55,060
What do you even do in Belgium?

877
00:35:55,060 --> 00:35:59,220
- You walk around, you eat some Belgian waffles.

878
00:35:59,220 --> 00:36:00,060
You hang out.

879
00:36:00,060 --> 00:36:02,300
- I hate sweets and desserts.

880
00:36:02,300 --> 00:36:03,700
- I see.

881
00:36:03,700 --> 00:36:05,660
- This is not my country.

882
00:36:05,660 --> 00:36:06,500
- Cap.

883
00:36:06,500 --> 00:36:08,260
- That is not cap.

884
00:36:08,260 --> 00:36:10,340
I do not like sweets or desserts.

885
00:36:10,340 --> 00:36:12,780
I like savories.

886
00:36:12,780 --> 00:36:14,020
- Didn't you say that you just ate

887
00:36:14,020 --> 00:36:17,060
a chocolate thing just now?

888
00:36:17,060 --> 00:36:18,860
- Oh, my shobani flip?

889
00:36:18,860 --> 00:36:21,300
My chocolate haze craze?

890
00:36:21,300 --> 00:36:22,300
- Yeah. - Yeah.

891
00:36:22,300 --> 00:36:25,540
- Yes, but this is just because it's a quick way to fill up

892
00:36:25,540 --> 00:36:27,020
and I haven't had dinner yet.

893
00:36:27,020 --> 00:36:27,860
- And it's sweet and it's a treat.

894
00:36:27,860 --> 00:36:28,940
- So next question.

895
00:36:28,940 --> 00:36:33,940
No it's not, it has more protein than it does tens of calories.

896
00:36:33,940 --> 00:36:37,520
So, it fits my macros.

897
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:41,240
- I think you are just lying to yourself.

898
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:43,680
- I'm not one for sweets.

899
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:45,620
If I was, I'd tell you baby.

900
00:36:45,620 --> 00:36:49,380
I will eat, I'm a one bite of cake kind of guy.

901
00:36:49,380 --> 00:36:50,540
- I understand that.

902
00:36:50,540 --> 00:36:52,640
- I will have one bite of cake.

903
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:56,300
- I went to a Brazilian steakhouse the other night

904
00:36:56,300 --> 00:36:57,260
and I was thinking about--

905
00:36:57,260 --> 00:36:58,100
- Without us?

906
00:36:58,100 --> 00:37:01,460
yes not let's not do this again

907
00:37:01,460 --> 00:37:06,220
sorry come on we did it on several podcasts and I was thinking about how

908
00:37:06,220 --> 00:37:10,340
perfect all food should be three bites at a time

909
00:37:10,340 --> 00:37:15,100
yeah that's like I think that's what it's supposed to be

910
00:37:15,100 --> 00:37:21,540
yeah yeah sliders yeah just like but you know like different bites of things

911
00:37:21,540 --> 00:37:24,260
because you never want more than a couple bites

912
00:37:24,260 --> 00:37:29,140
I've been complaining about Taco Bell because they sell little sweet desserts

913
00:37:29,140 --> 00:37:35,780
in the amount of two or twelve. Oh and you want three? I want yeah I want like four.

914
00:37:35,780 --> 00:37:40,020
Well then just get two orders of two that doesn't seem that difficult. Well

915
00:37:40,020 --> 00:37:42,940
hey what am I gonna do what am I what do I look like? What do you mean what are you gonna do?

916
00:37:42,940 --> 00:37:50,180
Oh yeah let me just order two orders. Are you stupid? You order two tacos? Yeah just

917
00:37:50,180 --> 00:37:51,280
to order two of them.

918
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:55,180
- Okay, but maybe I want six.

919
00:37:55,180 --> 00:37:58,220
- Why would you choose the, okay, then order three.

920
00:37:58,220 --> 00:38:00,260
Why would you, why are you complaining?

921
00:38:00,260 --> 00:38:02,980
- You only ordered three of something for myself?

922
00:38:02,980 --> 00:38:05,420
- The complaint only, you're the one who wants

923
00:38:05,420 --> 00:38:07,580
to eat six of them, I don't fucking know.

924
00:38:07,580 --> 00:38:08,420
You were complaining.

925
00:38:08,420 --> 00:38:10,820
- Just give me one order of six.

926
00:38:10,820 --> 00:38:13,220
- You also, you had a second chance there.

927
00:38:13,220 --> 00:38:15,340
You could have said an odd number.

928
00:38:15,340 --> 00:38:18,200
That would have made your point make some amount of sense.

929
00:38:19,220 --> 00:38:22,180
But when you keep saying even multiples of two...

930
00:38:22,180 --> 00:38:24,380
Going with the theme of lying to ourselves,

931
00:38:24,380 --> 00:38:29,020
Ragnar is a big seller of this idea that he should always order

932
00:38:29,020 --> 00:38:31,220
much more food than he usually needs.

933
00:38:31,220 --> 00:38:33,260
And now he's coming down here being like,

934
00:38:33,260 --> 00:38:36,580
"No, no, no, we should only have a couple bites."

935
00:38:36,580 --> 00:38:37,540
You can't save something.

936
00:38:37,540 --> 00:38:39,940
Dessert, you don't need more.

937
00:38:39,940 --> 00:38:41,620
You need less dessert. Always.

938
00:38:41,620 --> 00:38:44,780
Then just get two.

939
00:38:44,780 --> 00:38:47,860
This is the most nonsense problem.

940
00:38:47,860 --> 00:38:52,300
- This means that you are at the apex of your life.

941
00:38:52,300 --> 00:38:54,580
You are right there at the top.

942
00:38:54,580 --> 00:38:56,740
You are fully actualized,

943
00:38:56,740 --> 00:38:58,800
and you're complaining about nothing,

944
00:38:58,800 --> 00:38:59,980
like literally nothing.

945
00:38:59,980 --> 00:39:03,820
- I could complain about so much more.

946
00:39:03,820 --> 00:39:05,140
- I know you can.

947
00:39:05,140 --> 00:39:07,060
No, no, I have an idea.

948
00:39:07,060 --> 00:39:08,700
That is crazy.

949
00:39:08,700 --> 00:39:10,900
- What do you have at this Brazilian steakhouse?

950
00:39:10,900 --> 00:39:13,220
- Meat.

951
00:39:13,220 --> 00:39:14,860
Lots of meat.

952
00:39:14,860 --> 00:39:15,700
Let's see.

953
00:39:15,700 --> 00:39:16,820
- Do you have picanha?

954
00:39:16,820 --> 00:39:21,720
Of course, had some picanha, had some pork sausage, had some brisket,

955
00:39:21,720 --> 00:39:25,800
had like eight different types of steak, the lemon pepper steak.

956
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:27,900
That was very good.

957
00:39:27,900 --> 00:39:30,260
Sounds amazing. Had some chicken.

958
00:39:30,260 --> 00:39:33,360
They came around. It was really funny.

959
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:36,840
I thought this guy had like an empty skewer, but he showed up at the table.

960
00:39:36,840 --> 00:39:39,440
He's like, Do you want chicken heart?

961
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:41,440
I was like, Whoa.

962
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:44,280
And you said, Yeah, of course, when it went to Rome

963
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:47,400
And it tastes it looked like an olive when you're

964
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:49,840
Brazilian, they're small, disgusted.

965
00:39:49,840 --> 00:39:51,540
It was there.

966
00:39:51,540 --> 00:39:53,680
They're pretty popular in Mexico, right?

967
00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:56,080
I don't think so.

968
00:39:56,080 --> 00:39:57,700
Or just South America.

969
00:39:57,700 --> 00:39:59,180
I think they're popular somewhere.

970
00:39:59,180 --> 00:40:01,480
And I think they're supposed to be like really yummy.

971
00:40:01,480 --> 00:40:03,040
But I don't know from my head.

972
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:07,440
I don't think it tasted, you know, it tasted like too much chicken.

973
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:10,600
Oh, it was kind of a pure chicken one bite.

974
00:40:10,600 --> 00:40:12,440
It was like a chicken bouillon cube.

975
00:40:12,440 --> 00:40:14,280
Yeah. Well, that's where I've eaten.

976
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:16,380
And it was really tough, really tough to eat.

977
00:40:16,380 --> 00:40:17,480
I see.

978
00:40:17,480 --> 00:40:20,060
Well, that's what I did.

979
00:40:20,060 --> 00:40:21,380
The chicken has come from.

980
00:40:21,380 --> 00:40:22,180
Yeah, it's his heart.

981
00:40:22,180 --> 00:40:23,060
The heart.

982
00:40:23,060 --> 00:40:27,360
It did. It did make me realize how just like kind of evil a place.

983
00:40:27,360 --> 00:40:28,760
Well, not evil, but like,

984
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:34,220
you know, you're just like, you just have so much dead animal around you.

985
00:40:34,220 --> 00:40:34,880
You're like, fuck it.

986
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:37,220
You want to fucking skewer of like 15 hearts?

987
00:40:37,220 --> 00:40:41,920
Yeah, that is some crazy apocalypto shit.

988
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:44,060
Right. Skewer full of hearts.

989
00:40:44,060 --> 00:40:46,060
Did it taste brave?

990
00:40:46,060 --> 00:40:48,060
No, it tasted weak.

991
00:40:48,060 --> 00:40:50,060
Maybe he wasn't really...

992
00:40:50,060 --> 00:40:52,060
The chicken never knew love.

993
00:40:52,060 --> 00:40:54,060
It wasn't loved.

994
00:40:54,060 --> 00:40:56,060
Could you taste which ones had love in them

995
00:40:56,060 --> 00:40:58,060
and which ones didn't?

996
00:40:58,060 --> 00:41:00,060
I mean, maybe. I only had one.

997
00:41:00,060 --> 00:41:02,060
Yeah, he had a loveless one.

998
00:41:02,060 --> 00:41:04,060
You need to spit that one out. That's like a pistachio shell.

999
00:41:04,060 --> 00:41:06,060
You don't eat that.

1000
00:41:06,060 --> 00:41:08,060
Yeah. Can I have a...

1001
00:41:08,060 --> 00:41:10,060
Can I have a chicken that's been loved?

1002
00:41:10,060 --> 00:41:12,060
Yeah, one that had a lot of friends and was appreciated by its community.

1003
00:41:12,060 --> 00:41:16,180
I think that I could have a chicken that I love like a dog

1004
00:41:16,180 --> 00:41:23,600
Personally, I think that's not very hard to do. I think it's really easy. I think you're pretty loving animals for the most

1005
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:28,340
But just a little nasty and then we murder them and cold blood

1006
00:41:28,340 --> 00:41:34,140
You're not down with him

1007
00:41:34,140 --> 00:41:40,580
Crusading against me. I I I just dated a Brazilian steakhouse. I mean, it's not like I'm like crusading against me

1008
00:41:40,580 --> 00:41:45,580
I think you are. I think you got some evilness to you today.

1009
00:41:45,580 --> 00:41:47,580
Well, it's because I ate the chicken heart.

1010
00:41:47,580 --> 00:41:52,580
You are Tom this week. And Caleb is Jerry.

1011
00:41:52,580 --> 00:41:54,580
And you're the old lady.

1012
00:41:54,580 --> 00:41:57,580
Yep. And you're putting a pie out on the windowsill and I'm skewing it.

1013
00:41:57,580 --> 00:42:00,580
I am mostly out of the picture. I'm baking pastries.

1014
00:42:00,580 --> 00:42:02,580
You could be the bulldog.

1015
00:42:02,580 --> 00:42:04,580
I could be the bulldog.

1016
00:42:04,580 --> 00:42:08,580
The thing about the bulldog is he doesn't have any allegiances. He's his own guy.

1017
00:42:08,580 --> 00:42:12,040
He hates fucking Tom are you crazy? No what?

1018
00:42:12,040 --> 00:42:18,580
He's not on Jerry's side, but he's definitely not on Tom's he doesn't even know Jerry exists so small

1019
00:42:18,580 --> 00:42:24,740
He has Tom so much that I don't think it's true. It's right scissors. That's the whole show

1020
00:42:24,740 --> 00:42:29,400
Yeah, that's that's not the whole show the whole show is rock versus paper

1021
00:42:29,400 --> 00:42:33,880
It's basically the whole show the bulldog is but it's not in it that much

1022
00:42:33,880 --> 00:42:36,480
He's in it enough to be paper

1023
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:37,940
No

1024
00:42:37,940 --> 00:42:41,940
Think about this. Here's rock, right?

1025
00:42:41,940 --> 00:42:42,940
Yep.

1026
00:42:42,940 --> 00:42:43,940
Here's scissors.

1027
00:42:43,940 --> 00:42:44,940
Okay.

1028
00:42:44,940 --> 00:42:47,940
Very simple to go between rock and scissor.

1029
00:42:47,940 --> 00:42:48,940
And what's paper?

1030
00:42:48,940 --> 00:42:49,940
And shilling paper?

1031
00:42:49,940 --> 00:42:51,940
Paper is a different thing completely.

1032
00:42:51,940 --> 00:42:52,940
That's hard.

1033
00:42:52,940 --> 00:42:54,940
That is totally different.

1034
00:42:54,940 --> 00:42:56,940
And to go from...

1035
00:42:56,940 --> 00:42:59,940
I mean, what am I even doing with my hand?

1036
00:42:59,940 --> 00:43:01,940
This, natural...

1037
00:43:01,940 --> 00:43:02,940
I don't know what we're talking about.

1038
00:43:02,940 --> 00:43:05,940
This, natural. This is insane.

1039
00:43:05,940 --> 00:43:08,440
This is basically a Nazi salute.

1040
00:43:08,440 --> 00:43:12,440
This is like, I'm gonna shoot you.

1041
00:43:12,440 --> 00:43:16,440
If you throw a rock and somebody throws paper, that's your only way out, by the way.

1042
00:43:16,440 --> 00:43:18,440
Whoa, what the hell are you doing?

1043
00:43:18,440 --> 00:43:24,440
Fucking Nazi crazy racist over here? What are you doing, man?

1044
00:43:24,440 --> 00:43:25,440
That's what makes no sense.

1045
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:28,440
He's so mad that he lost that he's doing a Heil Hitler.

1046
00:43:28,440 --> 00:43:31,440
Rock goes through paper quite easily.

1047
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:34,440
I think this is nonsense.

1048
00:43:34,440 --> 00:43:37,120
- Oh my god, it covers the rock.

1049
00:43:37,120 --> 00:43:39,880
- Okay, well what's your proposed alternative?

1050
00:43:39,880 --> 00:43:43,900
- Okay, well you're putting me on the spot.

1051
00:43:43,900 --> 00:43:45,320
- Yeah, I am putting you on the spot.

1052
00:43:45,320 --> 00:43:48,240
By the way, a rock can't break scissors either.

1053
00:43:48,240 --> 00:43:49,080
- Yes it can.

1054
00:43:49,080 --> 00:43:51,600
- Not my scissors.

1055
00:43:51,600 --> 00:43:55,000
- So, you're thinking about a scenario

1056
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:57,080
where you're smashing a scissor with a rock,

1057
00:43:57,080 --> 00:43:58,040
but you can't think of a scenario

1058
00:43:58,040 --> 00:44:01,640
where you're smashing through paper with a rock.

1059
00:44:01,640 --> 00:44:02,900
- Well just, but that's not the point.

1060
00:44:02,900 --> 00:44:05,940
the paper covers the rock and--

1061
00:44:05,940 --> 00:44:06,940
- Kinds it.

1062
00:44:06,940 --> 00:44:07,780
- Yeah. - And that's how

1063
00:44:07,780 --> 00:44:09,020
he kills the rock?

1064
00:44:09,020 --> 00:44:10,820
- He doesn't kill, there's no killing in it.

1065
00:44:10,820 --> 00:44:13,260
I mean, I guess scissors kills paper,

1066
00:44:13,260 --> 00:44:15,460
but it's nullifying the rock.

1067
00:44:15,460 --> 00:44:17,580
- Yeah, scissors kills paper,

1068
00:44:17,580 --> 00:44:18,820
rock kills scissors.

1069
00:44:18,820 --> 00:44:22,820
The paper's not killing the rock by smothering it

1070
00:44:22,820 --> 00:44:26,140
and letting it not breathe. - Well, it can't breathe.

1071
00:44:26,140 --> 00:44:28,740
No, you said it yourself, it can't breathe.

1072
00:44:28,740 --> 00:44:29,780
- I think this is ridiculous.

1073
00:44:29,780 --> 00:44:31,500
This is worse than the monkey Olympics

1074
00:44:31,500 --> 00:44:33,660
that we had earlier today.

1075
00:44:33,660 --> 00:44:37,020
- What about like a laser beam?

1076
00:44:37,020 --> 00:44:37,860
Like this.

1077
00:44:37,860 --> 00:44:40,100
(laughing)

1078
00:44:40,100 --> 00:44:41,060
- The point?

1079
00:44:41,060 --> 00:44:41,900
- Yeah, that would cut through a rock.

1080
00:44:41,900 --> 00:44:42,720
- That's too close to scissors.

1081
00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:44,580
You could too easily switch.

1082
00:44:44,580 --> 00:44:45,620
- I like this.

1083
00:44:45,620 --> 00:44:46,860
I like the beam.

1084
00:44:46,860 --> 00:44:47,700
I think this is my idea.

1085
00:44:47,700 --> 00:44:50,700
- Yeah, the scissors just cuts the beam in half.

1086
00:44:50,700 --> 00:44:53,420
(laughing)

1087
00:44:53,420 --> 00:44:55,620
- Okay, I actually do like that.

1088
00:44:55,620 --> 00:44:57,060
- I think this is a good idea.

1089
00:44:57,060 --> 00:44:58,300
- I actually do like that.

1090
00:44:58,300 --> 00:45:00,180
I changed my mind on that pretty fast.

1091
00:45:00,180 --> 00:45:05,180
- Okay, have you ever seen like a dead pig for a roast?

1092
00:45:05,180 --> 00:45:06,540
- Yes.

1093
00:45:06,540 --> 00:45:07,580
- Have you ever been close to a dead pig

1094
00:45:07,580 --> 00:45:09,220
that's gonna be roasted and cooked?

1095
00:45:09,220 --> 00:45:10,060
- Oh yeah, dude.

1096
00:45:10,060 --> 00:45:13,360
Whole hog barbecue in North Carolina.

1097
00:45:13,360 --> 00:45:19,220
- It's really fucked up seeing that pig's head

1098
00:45:19,220 --> 00:45:20,660
in your kitchen.

1099
00:45:20,660 --> 00:45:22,340
- The worst part is people say the best part

1100
00:45:22,340 --> 00:45:23,480
of the pig is the head.

1101
00:45:23,480 --> 00:45:27,940
The head has got amazing stuff going on.

1102
00:45:27,940 --> 00:45:32,540
I really love when the like Chinese cooking videos go around and you just see an entire

1103
00:45:32,540 --> 00:45:34,780
dead animal on a stick.

1104
00:45:34,780 --> 00:45:36,900
But it always still has the head for some reason.

1105
00:45:36,900 --> 00:45:38,580
Yeah, always has the head.

1106
00:45:38,580 --> 00:45:45,020
There's one video of like a pig and it's like perfectly bronzed and glazed and cooked and

1107
00:45:45,020 --> 00:45:49,300
then they just cut it and it looks like it's like made of paper.

1108
00:45:49,300 --> 00:45:50,300
And it looks amazing.

1109
00:45:50,300 --> 00:45:51,300
Paper pig.

1110
00:45:51,300 --> 00:45:52,300
They cut it with a rock?

1111
00:45:52,300 --> 00:45:53,300
No, they cut it with scissors, obviously.

1112
00:45:53,300 --> 00:45:54,300
They cut it with a laser.

1113
00:45:54,300 --> 00:45:58,100
No, they cut it with scissors obviously. They cut it with a laser cutter.

1114
00:45:58,100 --> 00:46:02,100
See

1115
00:46:02,100 --> 00:46:03,780
beam

1116
00:46:03,780 --> 00:46:04,980
Scissor

1117
00:46:04,980 --> 00:46:10,180
Rock. You think it should be beam scissors beam rock or rock beam scissors?

1118
00:46:10,180 --> 00:46:14,600
Yeah, he's gone. Beam loses to scissors

1119
00:46:14,600 --> 00:46:17,580
it's too

1120
00:46:17,580 --> 00:46:20,100
It's too important. Two is greater than one. Oh

1121
00:46:21,300 --> 00:46:26,960
Well, that's what it should be one two three, but for some reason then like it makes as much sense for three to beat one as

1122
00:46:26,960 --> 00:46:34,300
Any you know might as well be whatever you know look look how about this seven eight nine?

1123
00:46:34,300 --> 00:46:40,060
That's also eight beats seven is that great nine beats eight

1124
00:46:40,060 --> 00:46:44,480
Seven beats nine because because nines afraid of seven right

1125
00:46:44,480 --> 00:46:47,580
Okay, we're sorry

1126
00:46:47,580 --> 00:46:50,180
Okay, okay

1127
00:46:50,180 --> 00:46:52,740
- Actually, it should be six, seven, nine.

1128
00:46:52,740 --> 00:46:54,700
- Nine.

1129
00:46:54,700 --> 00:46:56,260
(laughing)

1130
00:46:56,260 --> 00:46:58,060
- That's so easy to throw up as well.

1131
00:46:58,060 --> 00:47:02,220
- Seven, eight, nine.

1132
00:47:02,220 --> 00:47:04,660
(laughing)

1133
00:47:04,660 --> 00:47:06,100
- Okay, do it one more time.

1134
00:47:06,100 --> 00:47:07,860
- Seven, eight.

1135
00:47:07,860 --> 00:47:09,060
- The people at home that are listening,

1136
00:47:09,060 --> 00:47:10,300
he's throwing up seven, eight, eight,

1137
00:47:10,300 --> 00:47:11,140
- That's not really an eight.

1138
00:47:11,140 --> 00:47:11,960
- in a word that says.

1139
00:47:11,960 --> 00:47:13,260
- The eight is the only thing I have a problem with.

1140
00:47:13,260 --> 00:47:14,100
That's barely an eight.

1141
00:47:14,100 --> 00:47:16,300
- That's a horrible, that's an eight.

1142
00:47:16,300 --> 00:47:17,900
- Yeah, that's what it looks like to be.

1143
00:47:17,900 --> 00:47:19,220
- Looks more like a B.

1144
00:47:19,220 --> 00:47:20,820
That's a B. That's a B.

1145
00:47:20,820 --> 00:47:22,220
You are splitting it.

1146
00:47:22,220 --> 00:47:24,720
Yeah, and this this is fucking scissors.

1147
00:47:24,720 --> 00:47:26,820
Yeah, that's what this is.

1148
00:47:26,820 --> 00:47:28,020
And this is a rock.

1149
00:47:28,020 --> 00:47:28,620
Yes.

1150
00:47:28,620 --> 00:47:29,120
Yes.

1151
00:47:29,120 --> 00:47:31,420
And those are all clear paper.

1152
00:47:31,420 --> 00:47:32,820
This is paper.

1153
00:47:32,820 --> 00:47:35,420
That's stop.

1154
00:47:35,420 --> 00:47:37,420
Okay.

1155
00:47:37,420 --> 00:47:38,720
Okay.

1156
00:47:38,720 --> 00:47:41,320
You fucker.

1157
00:47:41,320 --> 00:47:43,520
I think I don't like honey.

1158
00:47:43,520 --> 00:47:45,420
That is crazy.

1159
00:47:45,420 --> 00:47:46,020
I love honey.

1160
00:47:46,020 --> 00:47:47,420
Yeah, honey's yummy.

1161
00:47:48,320 --> 00:47:51,680
I don't know. It has like a flavor to it that I don't like lingering.

1162
00:47:51,680 --> 00:47:56,080
Honey is probably, when I was vegan, honey is probably the thing I missed the most

1163
00:47:56,080 --> 00:47:59,600
because I didn't have honey. I did blue agave syrup instead.

1164
00:47:59,600 --> 00:48:00,720
Yeah. Which sucks.

1165
00:48:00,720 --> 00:48:01,280
Why not honey?

1166
00:48:01,280 --> 00:48:02,720
Because bees are murdered.

1167
00:48:02,720 --> 00:48:03,760
Because a bee makes it.

1168
00:48:03,760 --> 00:48:05,200
Yeah.

1169
00:48:05,200 --> 00:48:07,360
Yeah, but it's their job to make it.

1170
00:48:07,360 --> 00:48:10,320
It's not like they're dying for it.

1171
00:48:10,320 --> 00:48:10,640
That is true.

1172
00:48:10,640 --> 00:48:11,360
Well, they die.

1173
00:48:11,360 --> 00:48:14,400
And that's why it's okay to order from Amazon because it's their job.

1174
00:48:14,400 --> 00:48:16,800
Yeah. Oh, and kill people.

1175
00:48:16,800 --> 00:48:17,440
Right.

1176
00:48:17,440 --> 00:48:18,980
Because who gives a fuck at this point?

1177
00:48:18,980 --> 00:48:20,440
Whatever, right?

1178
00:48:20,440 --> 00:48:21,980
It's their job.

1179
00:48:21,980 --> 00:48:23,440
It's literally their job.

1180
00:48:23,440 --> 00:48:24,240
That's what they do.

1181
00:48:24,240 --> 00:48:26,580
No, their job is dancing.

1182
00:48:26,580 --> 00:48:27,480
Bees don't dance.

1183
00:48:27,480 --> 00:48:29,780
We do dance, actually.

1184
00:48:29,780 --> 00:48:30,880
Have you guys seen the video?

1185
00:48:30,880 --> 00:48:34,440
That's the that's like two wasps versus a thousand bees

1186
00:48:34,440 --> 00:48:37,200
and the wasps win.

1187
00:48:37,200 --> 00:48:40,440
It's so awesome because the bees aren't coordinated.

1188
00:48:40,440 --> 00:48:42,080
The bees just hurt.

1189
00:48:42,080 --> 00:48:43,300
The bees just suck.

1190
00:48:43,300 --> 00:48:46,080
The bees just throw as much fucking bee

1191
00:48:46,080 --> 00:48:48,000
as possible at these wasps.

1192
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:49,760
And the wasps just hold down the forward,

1193
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:51,620
just crush the bees, man.

1194
00:48:51,620 --> 00:48:54,000
- Yeah, I always think about that when people are like,

1195
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:58,360
would you rather fight like one horse or a thousand chickens?

1196
00:48:58,360 --> 00:49:01,000
And it's like, the chickens aren't gonna gang up.

1197
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:03,080
- No, they don't know, we've talked about this.

1198
00:49:03,080 --> 00:49:05,640
You kill every chicken individually.

1199
00:49:05,640 --> 00:49:06,480
- Yeah.

1200
00:49:06,480 --> 00:49:08,600
With my scissors.

1201
00:49:08,600 --> 00:49:12,160
- They don't know what an enemy is.

1202
00:49:12,160 --> 00:49:13,680
- And then you eat their hearts.

1203
00:49:13,680 --> 00:49:14,800
- Yes.

1204
00:49:14,800 --> 00:49:15,640
- Callback.

1205
00:49:15,640 --> 00:49:16,740
Two Kovaks in a row?

1206
00:49:16,740 --> 00:49:19,240
Do you think if you ate a thousand chicken hearts,

1207
00:49:19,240 --> 00:49:22,040
you would gain some sort of ability or power?

1208
00:49:22,040 --> 00:49:23,140
Some balking power?

1209
00:49:23,140 --> 00:49:24,540
The chicken power?

1210
00:49:24,540 --> 00:49:25,340
Yeah.

1211
00:49:25,340 --> 00:49:26,540
I don't think I want chicken powers.

1212
00:49:26,540 --> 00:49:27,240
I don't think so.

1213
00:49:27,240 --> 00:49:28,140
They can't fly.

1214
00:49:28,140 --> 00:49:29,640
They don't have anything.

1215
00:49:29,640 --> 00:49:30,540
They can fly a little bit.

1216
00:49:30,540 --> 00:49:33,340
What's a chicken's job?

1217
00:49:33,340 --> 00:49:35,240
Lay eggs.

1218
00:49:35,240 --> 00:49:36,440
Eat seeds.

1219
00:49:36,440 --> 00:49:37,940
Will you eat eggs?

1220
00:49:37,940 --> 00:49:39,540
I love eggs.

1221
00:49:39,540 --> 00:49:42,540
No, would you eat eggs if you're vegan?

1222
00:49:42,540 --> 00:49:43,440
If you could lay your own eggs.

1223
00:49:43,440 --> 00:49:44,740
No, I didn't eat eggs.

1224
00:49:44,740 --> 00:49:46,280
No, vegans don't eat eggs.

1225
00:49:46,280 --> 00:49:47,280
Yeah, definitely not.

1226
00:49:47,280 --> 00:49:49,220
That was the first thing.

1227
00:49:49,220 --> 00:49:53,060
And you're supposed to, you're supposed to give the chicken back its egg.

1228
00:49:53,060 --> 00:49:57,820
Right. When you're vegan and you have a, that's what you say to do with the egg.

1229
00:49:57,820 --> 00:50:01,460
You go to the market, you buy a thing of eggs and you just give it back to the chickens.

1230
00:50:01,460 --> 00:50:02,940
Here you go.

1231
00:50:02,940 --> 00:50:05,300
The chickens, by the way, they're going to be eating those eggs.

1232
00:50:05,300 --> 00:50:09,860
Yeah. They eat eggs and they eat each other, too.

1233
00:50:09,860 --> 00:50:12,140
Every animal except humans eats each other.

1234
00:50:13,100 --> 00:50:15,340
I think some humans eat other humans.

1235
00:50:15,340 --> 00:50:16,740
Well, just barely, though.

1236
00:50:16,740 --> 00:50:19,300
What's what's barely?

1237
00:50:19,300 --> 00:50:19,700
What does that mean?

1238
00:50:19,700 --> 00:50:22,840
Like one in a hundred people has eaten somebody.

1239
00:50:22,840 --> 00:50:24,540
It's not that many.

1240
00:50:24,540 --> 00:50:27,800
It was fun for a couple of days when people thought the guys

1241
00:50:27,800 --> 00:50:29,540
on the submarine were still alive.

1242
00:50:29,540 --> 00:50:31,740
It was fun to think about them eating each other down there

1243
00:50:31,740 --> 00:50:35,540
or having gay sex.

1244
00:50:35,540 --> 00:50:37,800
That everybody said that.

1245
00:50:37,800 --> 00:50:39,800
I don't think that's what I would do.

1246
00:50:39,800 --> 00:50:41,940
Like, I wouldn't be like,

1247
00:50:41,940 --> 00:50:44,860
Oh, I need to fuck my friend's dad.

1248
00:50:44,860 --> 00:50:45,700
I don't think I would.

1249
00:50:45,700 --> 00:50:48,020
I would be stuck with him.

1250
00:50:48,020 --> 00:50:49,580
I think it's fine.

1251
00:50:49,580 --> 00:50:50,260
I think I'd be hungry.

1252
00:50:50,260 --> 00:50:51,340
I think it'd be very hungry.

1253
00:50:51,340 --> 00:50:53,420
But I would be hungry.

1254
00:50:53,420 --> 00:50:54,180
Oh, yeah.

1255
00:50:54,180 --> 00:50:56,500
And that's why they don't bring any women down there.

1256
00:50:56,500 --> 00:50:57,300
Yeah.

1257
00:50:57,300 --> 00:50:59,060
That's what my mom said one time.

1258
00:50:59,060 --> 00:51:01,700
My mom was like,

1259
00:51:01,700 --> 00:51:03,180
listen, I'm all for equal rights,

1260
00:51:03,180 --> 00:51:05,460
but I don't think women should be allowed on submarines.

1261
00:51:05,460 --> 00:51:07,540
And I was like, what?

1262
00:51:07,540 --> 00:51:10,260
And she's like, yeah, I don't think women should be allowed on submarines.

1263
00:51:10,260 --> 00:51:12,900
I think the guys down there are going to get bored.

1264
00:51:12,900 --> 00:51:16,000
They're going to choose being completely serious.

1265
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:17,460
That's awesome.

1266
00:51:17,460 --> 00:51:20,160
She truly, I think, to this day, and she's like she likes

1267
00:51:20,160 --> 00:51:22,160
she's like a Pete Buttigieg voter.

1268
00:51:22,160 --> 00:51:24,100
Yeah, she's like, I don't think women should be.

1269
00:51:24,100 --> 00:51:27,600
Women should be the president, but not on a submarine. Yeah.

1270
00:51:27,600 --> 00:51:32,320
Oh, they'll be the president down there.

1271
00:51:32,320 --> 00:51:34,260
Yeah. Cock.

1272
00:51:34,260 --> 00:51:37,100
Well, we're saying that, I mean, it's

1273
00:51:37,900 --> 00:51:40,300
Basically rape that you're making a joke about here, Rex.

1274
00:51:40,300 --> 00:51:43,140
I don't think

1275
00:51:43,140 --> 00:51:48,980
I don't think there's laws that apply to the sea in terms of.

1276
00:51:48,980 --> 00:51:54,920
That's your response to what I just said, is that there's no laws in the deep.

1277
00:51:54,920 --> 00:51:58,420
Yeah, I think it's just about survival.

1278
00:51:58,420 --> 00:52:01,720
Yeah, you got to you got to survive by having sex with someone.

1279
00:52:01,720 --> 00:52:04,920
Yeah, they should give women

1280
00:52:04,920 --> 00:52:07,820
like brass knuckles down there.

1281
00:52:07,820 --> 00:52:14,960
yeah that might work I thought it was that that submarine the the window was

1282
00:52:14,960 --> 00:52:19,560
feel like you could only take a shit like in the front of the submarine the

1283
00:52:19,560 --> 00:52:22,880
word were that either we're supposed to look out of the window just taunting an

1284
00:52:22,880 --> 00:52:27,320
octopus right there at the front of the submarine well it's funny cuz you know

1285
00:52:27,320 --> 00:52:31,840
like what happened to it is it just collapse like this yeah and you know

1286
00:52:31,840 --> 00:52:36,500
they talked about it just exploding right but on this side of it there's a bunch

1287
00:52:36,500 --> 00:52:38,940
of poop and pee.

1288
00:52:38,940 --> 00:52:42,800
So at your last moment, you're being

1289
00:52:42,800 --> 00:52:45,240
clouded together with a bunch of words.

1290
00:52:45,240 --> 00:52:46,280
And you're down there for like

1291
00:52:46,280 --> 00:52:48,200
they were down there for like an hour out of thing.

1292
00:52:48,200 --> 00:52:49,940
There was any pee or shit in there.

1293
00:52:49,940 --> 00:52:52,740
See, it's no that no, because I'm the kind of guy

1294
00:52:52,740 --> 00:52:55,740
where as soon as that door locks, the car, I'm taking a shit.

1295
00:52:55,740 --> 00:52:58,000
I'm I'm taking a shit in front of everybody.

1296
00:52:58,000 --> 00:52:59,680
I know there's a curtain.

1297
00:52:59,680 --> 00:53:01,180
There is a curtain there.

1298
00:53:01,180 --> 00:53:02,140
Well, that's very courteous.

1299
00:53:02,140 --> 00:53:04,700
But there's a curtain is not going to stop what I'm cooking.

1300
00:53:05,100 --> 00:53:07,180
- Yeah, they want to see the view.

1301
00:53:07,180 --> 00:53:08,940
They're down here with me, they want to see the view.

1302
00:53:08,940 --> 00:53:10,620
Let the, open up the curtain.

1303
00:53:10,620 --> 00:53:11,580
- Check it out guys.

1304
00:53:11,580 --> 00:53:14,100
- If they're down for one hour also.

1305
00:53:14,100 --> 00:53:16,420
If I'm stuck on the toilet for the full hour,

1306
00:53:16,420 --> 00:53:17,940
nobody even got to see anything.

1307
00:53:17,940 --> 00:53:18,940
- Wait, okay, hang on.

1308
00:53:18,940 --> 00:53:19,780
What is it?

1309
00:53:19,780 --> 00:53:21,860
What do you think, what's happened?

1310
00:53:21,860 --> 00:53:25,860
- So they took a shit and it smelled so bad

1311
00:53:25,860 --> 00:53:28,740
that the kid was like, can I open this?

1312
00:53:28,740 --> 00:53:31,620
Can I open a fucking window down here?

1313
00:53:31,620 --> 00:53:32,460
- It smells horrible.

1314
00:53:32,460 --> 00:53:34,780
- I'd rather breathe water than this guy's shit.

1315
00:53:34,780 --> 00:53:37,580
And they were like, no, no, no, no, no.

1316
00:53:37,580 --> 00:53:39,080
Yeah, I guess that's possible.

1317
00:53:39,080 --> 00:53:41,520
That's not even possible.

1318
00:53:41,520 --> 00:53:42,520
It is possible.

1319
00:53:42,520 --> 00:53:42,980
It's not.

1320
00:53:42,980 --> 00:53:45,620
Clearly, they've never taken a shit in that van.

1321
00:53:45,620 --> 00:53:47,980
They're completely bolted in.

1322
00:53:47,980 --> 00:53:52,520
They can't open it like a car door from inside.

1323
00:53:52,520 --> 00:53:54,560
They can.

1324
00:53:54,560 --> 00:53:55,560
They can.

1325
00:53:55,560 --> 00:53:56,120
OK.

1326
00:53:56,120 --> 00:53:57,560
You know how I know?

1327
00:53:57,560 --> 00:53:59,060
Because I've done it.

1328
00:53:59,060 --> 00:54:00,220
I've been on it.

1329
00:54:00,220 --> 00:54:01,020
Yep.

1330
00:54:01,020 --> 00:54:03,220
I was on it.

1331
00:54:03,220 --> 00:54:04,320
And we came back safely.

1332
00:54:04,320 --> 00:54:07,920
Isn't it kind of crazy that you could just open up planes emergency exit?

1333
00:54:07,920 --> 00:54:11,020
Yeah, I did see that.

1334
00:54:11,020 --> 00:54:12,560
Isn't that crazy?

1335
00:54:12,560 --> 00:54:14,060
Yeah. Why?

1336
00:54:14,060 --> 00:54:16,860
I didn't see that video, but apparently nothing happened.

1337
00:54:16,860 --> 00:54:19,860
Like, like, like shit doesn't go flying out.

1338
00:54:19,860 --> 00:54:23,160
No, they were low.

1339
00:54:23,160 --> 00:54:24,900
OK, I see.

1340
00:54:24,900 --> 00:54:27,760
Oh, maybe there's some kind of like pressure sensor on it.

1341
00:54:27,760 --> 00:54:31,200
So it knows where you are altitude wise or something.

1342
00:54:31,460 --> 00:54:37,380
Yeah, you can't just open it willy-nilly, but I mean that's you know

1343
00:54:37,380 --> 00:54:40,260
I'm gonna try one someday

1344
00:54:40,260 --> 00:54:45,320
Um, I would not suggest that I'm really

1345
00:54:45,320 --> 00:54:48,460
Try you guys wanna go to the beach

1346
00:54:48,460 --> 00:54:55,900
Yes, between you guys want to go to Cancun with me. I think I would fit right in in Cancun you would

1347
00:54:55,900 --> 00:55:01,060
Well, yeah, it's a it's a completely it's a bullshit city made for like white Americans

1348
00:55:01,060 --> 00:55:06,060
I think women are banned from the state.

1349
00:55:06,060 --> 00:55:11,060
I think women are banned from the state.

1350
00:55:11,060 --> 00:55:16,060
I think women are banned from the state.

1351
00:55:16,060 --> 00:55:21,060
I think women are banned from the state.

1352
00:55:21,060 --> 00:55:26,060
I think women are banned from the state.

1353
00:55:26,060 --> 00:55:33,400
Yeah, I think women are banned from the state. Yeah, I just heard sorry

1354
00:55:33,400 --> 00:55:36,620
I just heard my wife tell our dog you're done

1355
00:55:36,620 --> 00:55:40,140
Another time

1356
00:55:40,140 --> 00:55:42,880
Yeah, he's talking his talk arguing

1357
00:55:42,880 --> 00:55:44,860
Yeah

1358
00:55:44,860 --> 00:55:46,860
Imagine arguing with a dog and losing

1359
00:55:46,860 --> 00:55:49,620
She lost

1360
00:55:49,620 --> 00:55:52,120
I just heard it stop stop

1361
00:55:54,260 --> 00:55:57,720
You know yeah, that's what it sounds like to lose an argument the dog

1362
00:55:57,720 --> 00:56:04,140
I think if your entire house went down into the submarine Caleb you yeah your wife and your dog

1363
00:56:04,140 --> 00:56:08,700
I think your wife would be the first to go with the dog a hundred percent

1364
00:56:08,700 --> 00:56:13,060
I think I think maybe even the dog would outlive both of you now that I think about it

1365
00:56:13,060 --> 00:56:17,240
Yeah, he has a big head. He would easily kill both of us

1366
00:56:17,240 --> 00:56:24,080
He's like one bad bite away. That's a weird thing about like a chihuahua if a chihuahua bites somebody

1367
00:56:24,080 --> 00:56:24,920
You don't have to.

1368
00:56:24,920 --> 00:56:26,420
It's not a big deal.

1369
00:56:26,420 --> 00:56:27,540
It my dog.

1370
00:56:27,540 --> 00:56:32,140
Like today we were at the park and we there was a little girl with a scooter

1371
00:56:32,140 --> 00:56:35,720
who rode directly at him while we were throwing the ball

1372
00:56:35,720 --> 00:56:39,280
and said, Doggie, and like put her arms out.

1373
00:56:39,280 --> 00:56:41,840
And I had to stop him from killing her.

1374
00:56:41,840 --> 00:56:45,340
Yeah. And if I did not act fast, he would.

1375
00:56:45,340 --> 00:56:47,520
I would be in jail right now.

1376
00:56:47,520 --> 00:56:50,640
He would have been dead instantly.

1377
00:56:50,640 --> 00:56:53,220
Yeah. And it's like, you know, maybe train your

1378
00:56:53,740 --> 00:56:55,500
Your daughter a little better straight.

1379
00:56:55,500 --> 00:56:57,700
Yeah, I don't think you should be playing for that.

1380
00:56:57,700 --> 00:57:00,580
I think we should respect dogs.

1381
00:57:00,580 --> 00:57:02,700
But you know, he wants to.

1382
00:57:02,700 --> 00:57:05,200
He just wants to kill like let him be.

1383
00:57:05,200 --> 00:57:07,240
Like I'm not as king.

1384
00:57:07,240 --> 00:57:08,880
Yeah, he's a person.

1385
00:57:08,880 --> 00:57:11,420
Who am I to stop a wild animal, which he is, by the way?

1386
00:57:11,420 --> 00:57:12,220
Wild. Yeah.

1387
00:57:12,220 --> 00:57:16,060
Who am I to stop a wild animal from from capturing prey?

1388
00:57:16,060 --> 00:57:18,220
It's really none of my business.

1389
00:57:18,220 --> 00:57:19,900
You're not like his dad.

1390
00:57:19,900 --> 00:57:20,600
You're more like his own.

1391
00:57:20,600 --> 00:57:22,000
This is roommate.

1392
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:26,000
Yeah, I'm imposing my Judeo Christian values on this dog.

1393
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:28,740
He doesn't know what either of those words mean.

1394
00:57:28,740 --> 00:57:32,240
He only knows like eight words to begin with.

1395
00:57:32,240 --> 00:57:34,740
He knows sit, spin, lay,

1396
00:57:34,740 --> 00:57:40,840
surrender, crate and play.

1397
00:57:40,840 --> 00:57:43,840
So six. What about stop?

1398
00:57:43,840 --> 00:57:47,480
He does not know stop, but that's probably a good idea

1399
00:57:47,480 --> 00:57:51,180
if he keeps running at girls.

1400
00:57:51,180 --> 00:57:52,720
That's my teach him stop.

1401
00:57:52,720 --> 00:57:56,060
Yeah, most people could use that word when they're running at girls.

1402
00:57:56,060 --> 00:57:58,720
Yeah. Stop. Stop.

1403
00:57:58,720 --> 00:58:03,500
Stop running. Train a lot of these men, human men, that is to stop.

1404
00:58:03,500 --> 00:58:06,540
To stop. What the fuck just happened to you?

1405
00:58:06,540 --> 00:58:11,200
I actually went straight to my throat.

1406
00:58:11,200 --> 00:58:13,940
Why did you I'm convinced you don't know how to drink.

1407
00:58:13,940 --> 00:58:18,240
Every time you take a sip of it, it's a straw.

1408
00:58:18,240 --> 00:58:20,720
No, that's not true.

1409
00:58:20,720 --> 00:58:22,120
It doesn't matter how palatable it is.

1410
00:58:22,120 --> 00:58:23,620
You always have a bad reaction.

1411
00:58:23,620 --> 00:58:27,220
There's no way what he just drank was bad in any way.

1412
00:58:27,220 --> 00:58:29,720
No, it wasn't that bad.

1413
00:58:29,720 --> 00:58:31,820
I was like I said, I wasn't really a fan of the

1414
00:58:31,820 --> 00:58:34,820
I'm not a big fan of the honey favoring.

1415
00:58:34,820 --> 00:58:39,120
I think honey is OK, but I really wouldn't go for it.

1416
00:58:39,120 --> 00:58:42,020
Most times you said go for it.

1417
00:58:42,020 --> 00:58:43,620
Go for it.

1418
00:58:43,620 --> 00:58:46,620
Most times it wasn't too alcoholic.

1419
00:58:46,620 --> 00:58:48,920
It was it was kind of like just a hard tea, actually.

1420
00:58:48,920 --> 00:58:50,220
now that I think about it.

1421
00:58:50,220 --> 00:58:52,560
But it just went straight to my throat

1422
00:58:52,560 --> 00:58:54,800
and I almost choked to death live on camera.

1423
00:58:54,800 --> 00:58:57,060
That would have been pretty good.

1424
00:58:57,060 --> 00:58:59,300
We probably would have been on a live stream fail for that.

1425
00:58:59,300 --> 00:59:01,100
Yeah, that is a live stream fail.

1426
00:59:01,100 --> 00:59:03,240
Live streamer dies.

1427
00:59:03,240 --> 00:59:04,880
Live streamer dies.

1428
00:59:04,880 --> 00:59:07,480
OK, guys, it's time to put our foot down

1429
00:59:07,480 --> 00:59:09,540
now that we're talking about live streaming.

1430
00:59:09,540 --> 00:59:12,220
When are we moving to kick.com?

1431
00:59:12,220 --> 00:59:16,760
I will do a gambling stream on kick.com any day.

1432
00:59:17,220 --> 00:59:23,520
Whenever you guys are down. I'm willing and able I would love to yeah, I think that'd be really fun

1433
00:59:23,520 --> 00:59:27,140
Well, they just added a these added mature audience

1434
00:59:27,140 --> 00:59:29,740
categories for content on twitch

1435
00:59:29,740 --> 00:59:31,260
the added porn

1436
00:59:31,260 --> 00:59:32,940
categories no

1437
00:59:32,940 --> 00:59:39,380
Gambling categories is that true? It's that's true. That's completely true. You can look it up right now mature content

1438
00:59:39,380 --> 00:59:45,180
Tags, I think it's what they call. Well, I gotta see this. Can I browse and see mature content?

1439
00:59:46,860 --> 00:59:48,860
I went fucking everywhere dude

1440
00:59:48,860 --> 00:59:51,620
Diablo 4 is that mature?

1441
00:59:51,620 --> 00:59:57,220
My official recommendation for the lemon dial lemon sour is it's okay. It's not

1442
00:59:57,220 --> 01:00:00,440
My girlfriend said it was gonna be bad, but it was completely okay

1443
01:00:00,440 --> 01:00:04,540
My final for the giant hard tea I

1444
01:00:04,540 --> 01:00:10,260
Didn't give this a rating earlier. I'm gonna give this a 5/4. This is just okay

1445
01:00:10,260 --> 01:00:16,280
Don't you don't jump out of your seat to go grab this at the store. Don't run to the store to get this

1446
01:00:16,280 --> 01:00:18,280
this is really nothing special.

1447
01:00:18,280 --> 01:00:20,280
Um, but, you know,

1448
01:00:20,280 --> 01:00:22,280
if you need a, uh,

1449
01:00:22,280 --> 01:00:24,280
if you're looking for something expensive,

1450
01:00:24,280 --> 01:00:26,280
this is a good start.

1451
01:00:26,280 --> 01:00:28,280
I think this was $7.

1452
01:00:28,280 --> 01:00:30,280
Oh man.

1453
01:00:30,280 --> 01:00:32,280
I think this was like $10 and it was okay.

1454
01:00:32,280 --> 01:00:34,280
That's crazy.

1455
01:00:34,280 --> 01:00:36,280
That is crazy. Okay, I have to leave.

1456
01:00:36,280 --> 01:00:38,280
Oh, okay. Yeah.

1457
01:00:38,280 --> 01:00:40,280
Okay, well, bye. Bye.

1458
01:00:40,280 --> 01:00:42,280
We're gonna keep talking. Do your thing.
