1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,720
Long, long ago, the world had no Christmas.

2
00:00:05,720 --> 00:00:09,080
Toys would be made, but never be presents.

3
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:14,200
Children were good, bad, naughty, or nice, but no coal would be given.

4
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:19,480
No checking lists twice.

5
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:22,960
But one day, that all changed.

6
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:24,960
For Santa gave birth.

7
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:28,080
The son of Santa, king of kings, such merry and mirth.

8
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:33,320
but this would not happen without three wise men. This is their story from

9
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:38,520
beginning to end. I wish I wrote my intro in rhyming now. I hate that rap crap.

10
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:42,440
Yeah, me too. So who are these three magi, these three wise men? Let's start

11
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:46,840
on my right here. Okay. Well, I didn't figure out a voice yet, so I'm gonna

12
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:49,040
just say the first sentence and see what comes out.

13
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:57,040
My name

14
00:00:57,040 --> 00:00:58,940
thing good like

15
00:00:58,940 --> 00:01:08,380
of the candy kingdom. It's pretty good. I am a wise M&M sage, the wisest and

16
00:01:08,380 --> 00:01:16,580
oldest in the land. The king of the candy kingdom relies on me for all advice and

17
00:01:16,580 --> 00:01:23,800
policy, but now I wander the desert in search of the son of Santa. I have been

18
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:29,500
commanded by the candy king to bring the son of Santa a gift, the gift of

19
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:37,500
chocolate. But these sands are harsh on a 98 year old M&M. Oh, how I long for

20
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:43,980
the comforts of my candy kingdom. It's chocolate spires and chocolate archways,

21
00:01:43,980 --> 00:01:49,140
roads paved in chocolate and chocolate everything else as well.

22
00:01:50,380 --> 00:01:56,740
nice and I'm I'm an ancient M and M from before from B. C. Times, so I look

23
00:01:56,740 --> 00:02:00,540
like a normal M and M, but I made out of antelope hide. That's I saw chocolate on

24
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:04,460
the inside, but it's animal, animal skins and it's really dark chocolate,

25
00:02:04,460 --> 00:02:07,980
a hundred percent cocoa nib type chocolate. Yeah, that's really good, but

26
00:02:07,980 --> 00:02:11,060
I still have an M. I forgot about the present. Can I change my present or do

27
00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:15,060
you have written? You could change your present. M is for Mesopotamian. It's for

28
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:21,020
My name is M. And so you're and so you you are this wise sage M and M who old

29
00:02:21,020 --> 00:02:22,900
old, old and wise.

30
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:24,260
And you

31
00:02:24,260 --> 00:02:29,380
just disgusting. That's all they had back then. They had discovered vanillia.

32
00:02:29,380 --> 00:02:35,900
Frankincense, myrrh, sage. Disgusting sage. And you're travelling with a couple

33
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:42,300
of other wise magi. Let's go, let's give him time to think of what he's gonna say

34
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:43,620
and go right to Caleb.

35
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:45,820
(clears throat)

36
00:02:45,820 --> 00:02:46,820
Hold on, bitch.

37
00:02:46,820 --> 00:02:47,820
I'm holding on.

38
00:02:47,820 --> 00:02:52,540
(coughs)

39
00:02:52,540 --> 00:02:56,340
I come from the Elf tribe of the North Pole,

40
00:02:56,340 --> 00:02:57,420
where for thousands of years,

41
00:02:57,420 --> 00:03:00,620
my ancestors have been barely surviving in the harsh cold,

42
00:03:00,620 --> 00:03:02,820
living off of the rancid flesh from dead animals

43
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:05,500
washed ashore, and sometimes, each other.

44
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:07,380
My father fell in the cold last winter

45
00:03:07,380 --> 00:03:09,980
because he thought he saw a strawberry.

46
00:03:09,980 --> 00:03:12,080
There's little to do except look for food,

47
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:15,320
where I come from and look for food where I come from

48
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:17,980
and wait for the cold to claim those closest to you.

49
00:03:17,980 --> 00:03:21,160
We mostly pass the time by having ice eating competitions

50
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:23,920
and also making Xboxes and OLED TVs,

51
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:26,360
even though we don't know what those are yet.

52
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:29,000
One week ago, I saw a bright star in the sky

53
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,800
and heard a voice that told me that a child

54
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:34,920
might give my people purpose in 17 or 1800 years.

55
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:36,440
So I'm an elf on a mission.

56
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:39,480
My name is Harold and I'm on a quest to save my people.

57
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:40,580
and I'm going to give him

58
00:03:40,580 --> 00:03:42,880
massage chair

59
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:47,380
massage here for the sun. Yeah, I love that Griffin McElroy. Yeah,

60
00:03:47,380 --> 00:03:49,880
he sounds like an out

61
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:56,580
well. Just do Griffin McElroy. Yeah and X boxes and L a TV.

62
00:03:56,580 --> 00:04:03,380
So we have an old M and M traveling with Griffin McElroy. Yeah, well Harold,

63
00:04:03,380 --> 00:04:05,180
but you're old McElroy the elf

64
00:04:05,180 --> 00:04:09,180
and yeah, you're from the North Pole, but there's there is no Christmas. So

65
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:13,680
it's just this cold, harsh, confusing place. We don't know why we're there,

66
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:16,100
we don't know where we came from, we don't know where to go.

67
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:20,400
There is another elf kingdom, a sister kingdom that you will visit. Sister?

68
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:24,940
Holy crap. Also make a ton of toys. Oh, shiz. It would be nice if

69
00:04:24,940 --> 00:04:29,280
something could be done about that. And make a ton of toys. Where is it,

70
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:29,780
China?

71
00:04:29,780 --> 00:04:34,700
Well, a lot of the elves are being... Hit that zombie nation.

72
00:04:36,460 --> 00:04:38,460
Hey, you actually got it on the second try.

73
00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:43,100
A lot of elves are being replaced by China.

74
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:43,760
Yep.

75
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:46,500
And yep to that is what I said.

76
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:47,000
Okay.

77
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:51,300
Okay, who is left?

78
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:52,740
Hello, bitch.

79
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:55,500
You all remember me from our previous campaign?

80
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:57,500
Bitch, it's me, Pikachu.

81
00:04:57,500 --> 00:05:02,200
From the Valentine's Day campaign we did two years ago.

82
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:04,800
You remember that?

83
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:05,860
remember

84
00:05:05,860 --> 00:05:10,000
fans have been begging for this character to come back.

85
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:14,560
People have them. We remember this character. We will be my

86
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:20,040
member about him is I remember I'm a member. I'm popped. You look you should

87
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:22,320
have been a member Barry. You're dressed up like one.

88
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:32,160
I heard I heard that there was a baby that was immaculately conceived and I

89
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:34,600
wanted to see what the vagina would look like.

90
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:40,220
I don't remember this character at all. I remember he was a power sunrise. He

91
00:05:40,220 --> 00:05:44,100
was supposed to be like Pepe Lapu kind of, but then you that was fun. We

92
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:47,520
accidentally made him Israeli and now I don't think I should really do that at

93
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:51,960
this time. I don't think it was an accident. I think it was a thing. I

94
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:54,040
think it was the first thing you thought of when you thought of the

95
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:58,500
character. I think maybe that's true. I have we listened to it two weeks ago

96
00:05:58,500 --> 00:05:59,520
when we played this

97
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:06,360
anyway, I bought the baby X dark temptation body spray to turn them into

98
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:10,060
a chocolate guy to walk around and have women. I'm going to teach him the game

99
00:06:10,060 --> 00:06:15,160
like a mystery who will not be around for another couple of hundred deals.

100
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:21,720
Two hundred two hundred deals like it's like right. It's like we're at zero a

101
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:25,920
D yeah we're a good zero yeah bro. By the way, I am at every single time

102
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:32,420
really like Dr. Manhattan. He was only in one time period. He can. I guess he was

103
00:06:32,420 --> 00:06:36,120
he saw everything you say. I will see I'll see everything. So I will teach the

104
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:38,160
baby about Tindale

105
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:45,180
and what they think apps are like. So for you to so I got a good sense of that.

106
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:50,460
You have advised the M and M can I'm wise by beyond my beyond my years. I'm

107
00:06:50,460 --> 00:06:54,220
ninety eight years old. I'm still wise beyond my years. I'm an old soul. Do you

108
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:59,440
elf Harold, do you advise them on building the OLED TVs? Like what do you

109
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:03,360
what do you do? Like why am I wise? Yeah, yeah. Because I'm the only person who

110
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:07,520
hasn't thought that there was a berry out there that I could find. All my

111
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:13,680
family has died looking for a berry. You got a 23 in your ACT. Yeah, we have ACT's out there.

112
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:18,680
We do unfortunately have to take standardized testing. If you get lower than a 23,

113
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:22,400
you're like you're berry prone. Yeah, we'll keep you away. You are looking for a berry.

114
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:27,500
I think exactly I come from I come as an elf. I cut you got a twenty three. I

115
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:31,700
think so. Yeah, is that isn't that good? I think that's bad. I think a third. I

116
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:36,000
think is like good. I thought I think twenty three is like remarkably average.

117
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,000
It's like a right. It's kind of right in the middle. I think it goes up to thirty

118
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:43,600
six. Yeah, so it's like we think that it says it's above the current national

119
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:47,800
average. It's a strong makes you a strong applicant. Look at you man. Many

120
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:50,600
universities. You're above average in the United States.

121
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:55,080
Not really saying much. What's wrong with the US?

122
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:57,540
That's

123
00:07:57,540 --> 00:08:02,600
amazing. You're Israeli. I dropped out of community college. And then you went to

124
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:04,840
a normal college. You went to a normal school. And then dropped out of that.

125
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:10,040
I dropped out of every single college I've been to. Yeah, every single one.

126
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:15,080
You're wise, I guess, because you're a Pikachu. I'm wise because I know game.

127
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:19,340
you live forever to and I also know game. That's the most important part about

128
00:08:19,340 --> 00:08:23,840
now. We know who you are, so all you guys have your get your docs up as well.

129
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:26,180
Yeah, we're all going to read this poem. I love

130
00:08:26,180 --> 00:08:30,020
yeah, you said Pikachus moves.

131
00:08:30,020 --> 00:08:33,620
Oh, because you didn't remember who this was. No,

132
00:08:33,620 --> 00:08:40,420
you didn't remember that this was just a guy named Pikachu. Yeah,

133
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:45,560
He gave him the animals. He gave me actual Pikachu. We did do a Pokemon thing.

134
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:49,840
Yeah. Well, that is true, bitch. Three wise magi traveled through the desert

135
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:54,520
and saw a star in the sky, one that with all their wisdom and occult knowledge,

136
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:59,540
they could not recognize. Perturbed and distressed, one of them said, "What

137
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:03,920
star could that be? What could that star mean?" To which another replied,

138
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:08,840
"I'm not sure. Where is my cream?" And he looked in his sack and still found

139
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:13,880
no cream. He checked his robe, there was no cream indeed. He shrugged and said,

140
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:18,600
"Away to the king we go to speak." And on they traveled, their journey began.

141
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:21,080
The third one said nothing, his mouth was slammed.

142
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:25,680
Whatever my dark temptation was in my mouth.

143
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:28,440
And so you guys are in this

144
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:31,560
desert, this hot desert right now,

145
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:36,240
on your way to go see the elf king, the Earl Konig.

146
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:38,360
And what now?

147
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:39,620
Earl Koenig.

148
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:40,660
Earl Koenig, you said?

149
00:09:40,660 --> 00:09:41,380
Earl Koenig.

150
00:09:41,380 --> 00:09:42,540
It's a German for elf king.

151
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:43,040
Keening.

152
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:43,540
Oh, OK.

153
00:09:43,540 --> 00:09:44,040
Keening?

154
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:44,540
Keening?

155
00:09:44,540 --> 00:09:45,460
You know how to say it, right?

156
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:45,960
Keening?

157
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:46,840
I learned the hard way.

158
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:47,340
Earl Keening.

159
00:09:47,340 --> 00:09:47,840
You did.

160
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:48,340
Did you?

161
00:09:48,340 --> 00:09:48,840
[LAUGHTER]

162
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:49,340
I did.

163
00:09:49,340 --> 00:09:51,820
I-- I'm now millions of people.

164
00:09:51,820 --> 00:09:52,820
[LAUGHTER]

165
00:09:52,820 --> 00:09:53,320
Millions.

166
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:53,820
Millions.

167
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:54,820
Millions is--

168
00:09:54,820 --> 00:09:55,320
And--

169
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:56,020
That'd be awesome.

170
00:09:56,020 --> 00:09:58,340
You see on the horizon of this hot, hot desert--

171
00:09:58,340 --> 00:10:00,640
I just-- you pointed over here, and I looked at the TV.

172
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:01,220
No, it's awesome.

173
00:10:01,220 --> 00:10:01,720
Yeah.

174
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:03,860
That's a power I have now.

175
00:10:03,860 --> 00:10:12,500
you see two men approach you one long one stout the one one round one real quick

176
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:18,180
heights long again. Oh character heights. How big is an M and M like one

177
00:10:18,180 --> 00:10:21,460
centimetre centimetre less than a centimetre? I think we're all pretty

178
00:10:21,460 --> 00:10:24,580
short, because if I remember correctly, you're an you're not a big M and M.

179
00:10:24,580 --> 00:10:28,540
You're not like I didn't think about it before. So think about it. Think about

180
00:10:28,540 --> 00:10:32,220
it. Are you like the one who hangs out? Well, okay, I'm a giant. I'm like three

181
00:10:32,260 --> 00:10:36,140
centimeters tall. Okay, that was like that's a big M and I was big as in

182
00:10:36,140 --> 00:10:39,300
and I guess the ones from the commercial. I think are three feet tall.

183
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:42,580
Yeah, I'll be the size of the one from the movie trailer. Okay, and you have

184
00:10:42,580 --> 00:10:43,340
lips

185
00:10:43,340 --> 00:10:49,680
no, I'm a boy. I'm an M. Oh, you have eyes. Yeah, sure. That's yeah. I look

186
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:53,500
like yes. Oh yeah, you're right. You have white sneakers on. Okay, sneakers

187
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:56,740
are at least I'm kind of a beige color with a burlap texture

188
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:03,900
sandals, a tweed rope around you. Yeah, yeah, yeah, and I have a taunt shirt.

189
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:09,800
Okay, this and I also have a walking stick. That's important to be good for

190
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:12,240
me to tell. I think if I remember correctly,

191
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:16,920
the way that I described Pikachu last time was five foot two and I'll dance

192
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:17,340
with you.

193
00:11:17,340 --> 00:11:22,340
So this time he has electric powers too. Yeah, I mean maybe

194
00:11:22,340 --> 00:11:26,800
he's always had them. Wow, and he didn't use them in a row. All right, and

195
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:31,100
And what is your look then? Your elf. I look exactly like I look in real life right now.

196
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:35,680
Okay, perfect. Except for the height. The height is lower. The height is in -- Your

197
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:40,100
height is lower than the elf's height, is what you're saying? I'm not even -- it doesn't

198
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:45,460
matter. You can probably guess what my elf height is. I don't need to -- Well, it's taller

199
00:11:45,460 --> 00:11:50,460
than Caleb, right? Like 5'9". For some reason, he looks like Christmas and Link to -- 5'9"

200
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:55,860
is actually average in -- above average in Asia. In Asia? You're in the North Pole, though.

201
00:11:55,860 --> 00:11:59,620
so is that the Asia? I guess it's kind of Asia. It's not that much. It's not not

202
00:11:59,620 --> 00:12:04,100
Asia, right? It's not Asia. It could be. It could. Move on, move on. So,

203
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:07,420
these two men approach you, they're all- both of them are- Where are we? We're

204
00:12:07,420 --> 00:12:09,420
in the desert? We're in the desert. You're traveling to the kingdom. Oh, my

205
00:12:09,420 --> 00:12:13,820
God, it's so hot. It's so hot. I'm melting. I died. I'm just kidding, guys.

206
00:12:13,820 --> 00:12:17,140
You can't melt. You made out of- They don't have melting stuff in my body yet.

207
00:12:17,140 --> 00:12:22,820
And you see the long one lift his arm up and go, "There they are, Cain!" And

208
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:28,320
the one goes shut up able. Oh wait you're right there. They are and then they

209
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:30,720
wander up to you. What is a bitch?

210
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:37,620
The old God says you three are through white. Where's there? What old talk

211
00:12:37,620 --> 00:12:38,240
about old

212
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:40,360
this God is

213
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:43,360
God is older than you.

214
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:46,400
Yeah, he's sold

215
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:51,160
he shut up. You can't think of anything. This is how I this is my own internal

216
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:55,500
Okay, no quick attack. Oh really good. Okay. I don't want to fight the cane

217
00:12:55,500 --> 00:13:00,160
and able to which one are you attacking 13 13 plus six is 13 year old one.

218
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:05,200
Oh, which one are you attacking canery attacking the boss cane cane. All

219
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:08,600
right. So you attack him 19 does hit roll for damage. That's one d 8 plus

220
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:10,800
four and then we'll roll for initiative.

221
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:14,400
Nine.

222
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:16,600
That's not the

223
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:18,800
you didn't show me.

224
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:20,100
You didn't show me.

225
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:23,600
- You didn't show it to me and I just said yes.

226
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:24,540
- Which was a big mistake.

227
00:13:24,540 --> 00:13:25,380
- There we go.

228
00:13:25,380 --> 00:13:28,400
- Well I would have got six in any universe.

229
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:29,980
- In any universe.

230
00:13:29,980 --> 00:13:30,820
- What?

231
00:13:30,820 --> 00:13:33,780
- Six plus four is 10.

232
00:13:33,780 --> 00:13:35,340
- So, quick attack.

233
00:13:35,340 --> 00:13:36,180
- The doodoo ranger is hitting you.

234
00:13:36,180 --> 00:13:37,000
- Describe what is--

235
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,300
- The doodoo ranger is hitting me.

236
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:40,840
- How does Pikachu do quick attack?

237
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:41,680
- Just uh.

238
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:46,300
- He swipes his cape in front of his own face?

239
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:47,140
- Dracula.

240
00:13:47,140 --> 00:13:49,780
- But the swipe of the cape.

241
00:13:49,780 --> 00:13:52,880
Okay, so you hit Kane with that, he goes, "Ah, shit!"

242
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:54,460
Shut up, bitch!

243
00:13:54,460 --> 00:13:56,000
You shut up!

244
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:56,840
Okay.

245
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:58,680
All right, roll for initiative.

246
00:13:58,680 --> 00:13:59,680
Everybody roll for initiative.

247
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:01,200
All right, bro.

248
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:03,880
14, wait, wait, 14 plus six?

249
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:05,240
Why is my initiative so high?

250
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:06,640
I got a 24.

251
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:09,360
You made us OP so we don't die in this one.

252
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:10,200
A little bit.

253
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:12,040
Oh, I caught you red-handed.

254
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:13,840
I made you a little bit stronger.

255
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:15,360
You made me the strongest one here.

256
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:17,880
It's because there's a lot of adventuring,

257
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:19,000
And I'd--

258
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
- You thought that I was a regular Pikachu,

259
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:21,840
that's the problem.

260
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:24,400
(laughing)

261
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:27,080
- You thought I was a level one Pikachu.

262
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:29,400
- I got a 20 for my initiative roll.

263
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:30,320
- And what did you get?

264
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:31,440
- 24.

265
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:32,280
- And then what did you get?

266
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:33,100
- Nine.

267
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:34,080
- Okay, cool.

268
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:35,440
- Harold, you're gonna go first.

269
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:37,640
- Oh yeah, oh yeah, go Harold.

270
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:39,840
- So yeah, I mean, Kane's not looking good.

271
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:42,600
You're a little bit a ways away,

272
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:45,280
not a ways away, like 10, 15 feet away.

273
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:46,720
You have a couple abilities.

274
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:51,880
I gave you some bard like ones. You have Borealis Glow. It's basically fairy fire.

275
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:53,760
You said Cain is hurt, right?

276
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:58,240
Yeah, you have Bardic Inspiration, which is Carol, which you sing a song, a Christmas

277
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:01,680
song, but you don't know that it's a Christmas song, but some ancient song that your people

278
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:02,680
know.

279
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:07,560
I'm going to go Icicle Attack, but I'm going to do it on Abel.

280
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:11,400
Wait, if we just kill Cain, then Abel will be at our mercy.

281
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:16,120
But I have a feeling that Abel is a tank, so I'd like to freeze him.

282
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:19,620
Yeah, you have a chance of freezing them with that attack.

283
00:15:19,620 --> 00:15:20,620
Okay, I'm going to do that on Abel.

284
00:15:20,620 --> 00:15:22,620
Roll a d20. What did you get?

285
00:15:22,620 --> 00:15:23,620
Well, not so good.

286
00:15:23,620 --> 00:15:24,620
Is that a 9?

287
00:15:24,620 --> 00:15:25,620
That's a 6.

288
00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:26,620
Yeah, so plus 3 is 9.

289
00:15:26,620 --> 00:15:27,620
Yeah, 9.

290
00:15:27,620 --> 00:15:29,620
Yeah, so you swipe at Abel and Abel goes, "Eugh, eugh!"

291
00:15:29,620 --> 00:15:32,620
And you just somehow, you know, he does sort of Mr. Magoo dodges, right?

292
00:15:32,620 --> 00:15:33,620
Okay.

293
00:15:33,620 --> 00:15:35,620
Yeah, that's sort of the end of your turn.

294
00:15:35,620 --> 00:15:38,620
Next is Pikachu.

295
00:15:38,620 --> 00:15:44,620
Can I stun him with Thunder Wave? I'm going to do the exact same idea.

296
00:15:44,620 --> 00:15:45,620
You can try, yeah.

297
00:15:45,620 --> 00:15:48,360
but I will stun him with Thunder Wave.

298
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:48,860
Cool.

299
00:15:48,860 --> 00:15:50,360
Paralyzed for two turns.

300
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:52,700
No, you don't roll. He rolls.

301
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:53,200
Okay.

302
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:56,200
And he got much higher than a DC14 save,

303
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:58,040
so he does not get paralyzed.

304
00:15:58,040 --> 00:15:59,160
Crap on the stick.

305
00:15:59,160 --> 00:15:59,660
Yeah.

306
00:15:59,660 --> 00:16:00,880
Wait, then you know what I do?

307
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:01,800
I'll handle it, y'all.

308
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:02,620
Let's see what you do.

309
00:16:02,620 --> 00:16:05,000
I mean, you can move too, but that's about it.

310
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,800
And if you move, you will move away from Cain,

311
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:08,500
who will have an attack of opportunity.

312
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:11,800
Can I entrance him?

313
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:12,300
So you...

314
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:14,800
Maybe a sexual style dance?

315
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:19,380
You could yeah, you could try to dance. Okay, I start doing

316
00:16:19,380 --> 00:16:21,780
What do you think is a sexual dance?

317
00:16:21,780 --> 00:16:28,080
I I'm in my my Pikachu mind palace and I'm pulling up dances from I'm doing evolution of dance in my head

318
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:31,260
Mm-hmm, and then I taint it's like yeah, there's only like

319
00:16:31,260 --> 00:16:35,640
I'm doing evolution of dance in my head until I get to

320
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:42,360
2008 when I see the evolution of dance Wow, and then I just do the evolution of dance at him. Okay roll a

321
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:44,200
And this is one of your attacks.

322
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:45,200
Roll a speaking.

323
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:46,200
Roll mouth.

324
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:47,200
I'm rolling mouth.

325
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:51,360
No, this is not an attack, but like a kind of like same.

326
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:52,360
A talent.

327
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:53,360
A talent.

328
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:54,360
Okay, talent roll.

329
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:55,360
I'm rolling talent.

330
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:57,240
He's going to have to do very well for this to do anything at all.

331
00:16:57,240 --> 00:16:58,240
15.

332
00:16:58,240 --> 00:16:59,240
No.

333
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:01,640
So you do, you dance for like eight minutes.

334
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:05,640
I'm doing the entirety of Evolution of Dance and it's very impressive, but it's not the

335
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:06,640
time.

336
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:07,640
No, no.

337
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:11,020
And yeah, Cahain looks at you and he goes, "It's just not the time."

338
00:17:11,020 --> 00:17:14,720
but he takes some damage from how cringe it is man. Yeah, he does yeah.

339
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:19,220
Oof does he yawn? I just take some and bored image. Yeah. Does he open his

340
00:17:19,220 --> 00:17:23,320
mouth really, really wide and so you have an ability? Yes, don't spoil it for

341
00:17:23,320 --> 00:17:27,220
them. We'll get to you in a second. Does he yawn? He does. He yawns. It is his

342
00:17:27,220 --> 00:17:30,420
turn first. Oh shit. Can you make him yawn again at the end of his turn? I

343
00:17:30,420 --> 00:17:34,860
will. So he's gonna attack you. I just bore him. He's gonna attack you, Pat. So

344
00:17:34,860 --> 00:17:39,260
he picks up. He picks up able. He throws a stone in the air and uses him like a

345
00:17:39,260 --> 00:17:42,460
baseball bat to hit you with it. So let's see how we go. Able is short and

346
00:17:42,460 --> 00:17:44,380
squat. Yes. No, it was the other way around.

347
00:17:44,380 --> 00:17:50,400
It's not very good. So he tries to hit you with the stone and the stone just

348
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:53,920
walks past. You're able to go, oh, and it just maybe it hits my... Yeah,

349
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:56,500
maybe it hits your cape. It hits my cape. And you deflect it,

350
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:59,200
like in Smash Bros Mario. Yeah.

351
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:05,040
You look like Joker from Persuasion. Oh, yeah. With the mask as well as the

352
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:10,580
and then able is going to go now and able is going to throw up a stone and hit his

353
00:18:10,580 --> 00:18:12,500
head against it to try to hit you with it.

354
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:17,720
Oh, I get it and he misses yeah, yeah, he misses a last roll. Yeah, they're

355
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:21,420
doing terribly. All right, any yawns again, then both of them yawn cane and

356
00:18:21,420 --> 00:18:26,180
able then cane. Okay, so cane gets really tired and I run up and I jump into

357
00:18:26,180 --> 00:18:29,760
cane's mouth. I get swallowed by him, so they have to roll it. So here's what

358
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:32,000
they have to do. So he has a bill called eat me

359
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:39,320
They have to roll to resist his delicious flavor, and he is a very high

360
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:40,160
It's a very hard

361
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:46,780
It's a hard roll to resist and when he does that he goes inside of the enemy and then can beat them up from the inside

362
00:18:46,780 --> 00:18:53,200
Doing additional damage from his regular attacks however. He does take 1d for digestion every turn. He's inside

363
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:56,760
I didn't read that part, but that's okay. Yeah, you have to maybe just stay in the throat

364
00:18:56,760 --> 00:19:00,160
Maybe I'll just stay in the throat and grab the uvula so you can throw them up

365
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:05,400
Yeah. But then you would take stomach acid. He does not resist. Who did you want? I was

366
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:09,800
going into Cain. All right. You see, you guys. Yeah. You guys just hear me go. You know what?

367
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:15,240
I am getting kind of peckish. I said, I said, over guys, I'm gonna. And then I just get

368
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:23,160
swallowed. Holy clap. His mouth is so big. He's all that three foot man. Oh yeah. That

369
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:28,560
is a big M and M and stomach. Yeah. Yeah. Well, I want to see you eat the whole hoagie.

370
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:31,920
Luckily, Cain is kind of round. It just kind of fills him out, basically.

371
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:32,720
It's like having...

372
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:34,600
- Yeah. - Yeah.

373
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:38,720
So we're back to the top of the order now.

374
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:40,480
I don't do any damage right away?

375
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:44,160
No. No, in your next turn, you will.

376
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:45,920
Oh, I see. I should stay out of it now.

377
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:47,960
You should crap.

378
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:49,360
- We're back to the top of the order. - You should crap.

379
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:50,680
- A lot of crap. - Crap inside of you.

380
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:52,120
- A lot of crap, guys. - Me again?

381
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:53,600
- Yeah. - Okay.

382
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:56,720
So Cain seems to be taken care of.

383
00:19:56,720 --> 00:20:02,960
So I think that I will go after Abel.

384
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:03,460
Cool.

385
00:20:03,460 --> 00:20:05,680
And I think that I will do my icicle attack again.

386
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:06,680
Nice, go for it.

387
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:09,480
Shit.

388
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:09,980
Yeah.

389
00:20:09,980 --> 00:20:10,800
I suck, man.

390
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:11,480
We're going to die.

391
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:14,020
Yeah, Abel's just sort of bobbing and weaving.

392
00:20:14,020 --> 00:20:16,940
He's like going like, "Where'd my brother go?"

393
00:20:16,940 --> 00:20:17,640
You know, and stuff like that.

394
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:18,400
Don't dwell on it.

395
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:19,400
He's over there.

396
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:20,520
Wait, where did his brother go?

397
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:22,320
I point way far away.

398
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:22,980
Okay.

399
00:20:22,980 --> 00:20:25,020
He starts to walk away.

400
00:20:25,020 --> 00:20:26,020
Stupid ass bitch.

401
00:20:26,020 --> 00:20:28,020
And you do have an attack of opportunity.

402
00:20:28,020 --> 00:20:29,020
I hit him again!

403
00:20:29,020 --> 00:20:30,020
Okay, roll.

404
00:20:30,020 --> 00:20:31,020
With the icicle attack.

405
00:20:31,020 --> 00:20:32,020
We just killed Kane, this able guy.

406
00:20:32,020 --> 00:20:33,020
And 16.

407
00:20:33,020 --> 00:20:34,020
We don't even have to fight him.

408
00:20:34,020 --> 00:20:35,020
We can just trick him.

409
00:20:35,020 --> 00:20:36,020
Oh yeah.

410
00:20:36,020 --> 00:20:37,020
Okay, roll damage.

411
00:20:37,020 --> 00:20:38,020
Oh yeah.

412
00:20:38,020 --> 00:20:39,020
1d8.

413
00:20:39,020 --> 00:20:40,020
I know I'm going out of order, folks.

414
00:20:40,020 --> 00:20:41,020
This is fun, though.

415
00:20:41,020 --> 00:20:42,020
Well, that's a 3.

416
00:20:42,020 --> 00:20:43,020
3 plus 3.

417
00:20:43,020 --> 00:20:44,020
So 6.

418
00:20:44,020 --> 00:20:45,020
Nice.

419
00:20:45,020 --> 00:20:46,020
And then DC 10.

420
00:20:46,020 --> 00:20:47,020
Yeah, so he has to try to resist.

421
00:20:47,020 --> 00:20:48,020
Oh, great line.

422
00:20:48,020 --> 00:20:49,020
Oh, this guy's fail is fucked.

423
00:20:49,020 --> 00:20:52,020
So you hit him in the head with the icicle, and he goes, "Hey!"

424
00:20:52,020 --> 00:20:53,020
And he freezes.

425
00:20:53,020 --> 00:20:54,020
He's going to freeze for one second.

426
00:20:54,020 --> 00:20:58,620
and he freezes. He's going to freeze for one turn. Okay, take a picture of where

427
00:20:58,620 --> 00:20:59,620
it looks like I'm humping him.

428
00:20:59,620 --> 00:21:05,820
You could do that in your turn. Pikachu took a mental picture. Oh yeah. And so

429
00:21:05,820 --> 00:21:10,920
now... They don't have cameras yet, man. I'm going... Draw a tablet. I'm going

430
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:17,620
into my mind palace again. It's just a dance and a picture. Two screens.

431
00:21:17,620 --> 00:21:21,860
There's two things I'm watching, evolution of dance on one picture in

432
00:21:21,860 --> 00:21:25,060
picture window and then the other one I'm watching like the Kodak company

433
00:21:25,060 --> 00:21:25,940
invented camera.

434
00:21:25,940 --> 00:21:28,820
Okay, if we can get

435
00:21:28,820 --> 00:21:33,820
like a film and like all this other stuff, I could take a picture,

436
00:21:33,820 --> 00:21:37,820
but we need, we need to wait a couple of years. That's okay.

437
00:21:37,820 --> 00:21:41,660
The memory is gonna last way longer. Yeah, it's gonna last a really long

438
00:21:41,660 --> 00:21:42,060
time.

439
00:21:42,060 --> 00:21:43,860
Oh yeah.

440
00:21:43,860 --> 00:21:46,660
Oh, it's lasting.

441
00:21:46,660 --> 00:21:49,820
What are you looking at, Patrick? What's happening, man? I don't know, I'm

442
00:21:49,860 --> 00:21:52,900
to see what he's going to do with this turn. Oh, I don't think he knew it was

443
00:21:52,900 --> 00:21:55,260
his turn. I didn't know it was my turn because you were waiting for it. I didn't

444
00:21:55,260 --> 00:22:00,980
either. No, it's not. I didn't go. It is your turn. But I was in that moment, I was

445
00:22:00,980 --> 00:22:06,300
reimagining the moment of him pretending to hump him. Is that you're using your

446
00:22:06,300 --> 00:22:13,500
turn or? You know what, fuck it. I actually hump him. Okay, cool. Oh yeah. Kind of cool

447
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:19,920
Sullivan. Yeah, I get well if he's already inside of I'm not going to do

448
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:24,420
that much damage guys. You should still fight. Yeah, we just we said take a

449
00:22:24,420 --> 00:22:28,400
crap inside him. I will. I will able's frozen right crap doesn't damage.

450
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:34,460
You get a man to eat. You know what? While able is frozen and he's busy

451
00:22:34,460 --> 00:22:39,600
with Kane. I'm going to try evolution of dance again and in this case,

452
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:45,940
So the goal is okay, maybe you are distracted before, but now that I have

453
00:22:45,940 --> 00:22:48,780
your full attention, he's a captive audience. Now that I have your full

454
00:22:48,780 --> 00:22:52,840
attention, you need to watch this. This could be psychic damage, just roll.

455
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:59,280
Seventeen plus two, nineteen. So it's not even like you made up an attack,

456
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:04,180
but I guess yeah, it's just they just both of them just take each of them are

457
00:23:04,180 --> 00:23:08,700
gonna take one D4 psychic damage from seeing you do that. Oh yeah, that's how

458
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:09,720
Oh my God.

459
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:11,920
Kane takes four, Abel takes one.

460
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:12,920
So Kane's not looking too good.

461
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:15,800
He's in your tummy and he's like, "Argh, I smell."

462
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:16,800
He's in his tummy.

463
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:17,800
No, just let it be.

464
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:18,800
I'm sorry.

465
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:19,800
I got it wrong.

466
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:20,800
I just ate him.

467
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:21,800
I got it wrong.

468
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:22,800
No, no, no.

469
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:23,800
No, no.

470
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:24,800
No, no.

471
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:25,800
No, no.

472
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:26,800
No, no.

473
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:27,800
No, no.

474
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:28,800
No, no.

475
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:29,800
No, no.

476
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:30,800
No, no.

477
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:31,800
No, no.

478
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:32,800
No, no.

479
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:33,800
No, no.

480
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:34,800
No, no.

481
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:35,800
No, no.

482
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:36,800
No, no.

483
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:37,800
No, no.

484
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:43,400
months. I love that part. Yeah, I need to do a re watch. Yeah, pull that up.

485
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:47,240
Don't pull that. Don't pull it. Don't pull it. You'll lose me for eight

486
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:52,200
minutes. You lose all of us. Yeah. All right, cool. So now it is Cain's turn

487
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:54,000
and Cain is going to try to

488
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:59,200
get you out of his body. So he's going to try. I haven't even done anything

489
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:03,080
yet. He's still happy. Yeah. Oh, I'm so bummed. I ate an M and M. That's him.

490
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:05,720
Well, it's really hard to do it. So yeah, he doesn't he's not able to do

491
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:10,840
uses a turn trying to get you out. So yeah, you start to see the push and pull of the mechanic

492
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:16,680
now. Yeah. And it is now Abel's turn and Abel is frozen solid. It's something he can do.

493
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:21,240
You're now up. So now I attack and I do 1d6 extra damage, right? That's correct. I'm going

494
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:26,920
to use my candy punch. First of all, I would drink that's an eight. It's an eight. So that's

495
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:31,400
not going to hit. Not even from inside. Not even using an extra move to crap. I was going

496
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:33,600
I was going to say that I was going to want to use a bonus action. Yeah,

497
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:38,680
you give a bonus bonus crap yeah, but you crap chocolate. No, I don't know

498
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:39,120
you.

499
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:43,320
That would be like a crap lugs, human flesh and meat. I

500
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:48,000
excrement it's just shit man. Everything shits basically the same,

501
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,960
though, as an M and M sand grass

502
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:53,480
it was going to pass

503
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:56,280
all right. I believe that

504
00:24:57,800 --> 00:25:03,060
the ferns. Okay, yeah, right, so it's just sort of like just sort of

505
00:25:03,060 --> 00:25:03,560
manure.

506
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:12,340
He's like, "Oh, no!" It falls out like one of horse poops. Okay, and it

507
00:25:12,340 --> 00:25:17,620
looks exactly like a horse poop. Yeah. Alright, you see Cain. Cain goes like,

508
00:25:17,620 --> 00:25:23,000
"Oh!" And he vomits you up. He grabs Abel and he goes, "We gotta get out

509
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,540
of here!" I take one grossness damage. "We have to tell the old god about

510
00:25:25,540 --> 00:25:32,060
And they go and they start running off shit man riding able like a donkey don't I get an attack of opportunity?

511
00:25:32,060 --> 00:25:35,540
He's running away from me. Yeah, you do. Okay, I'm gonna try and punch him again

512
00:25:35,540 --> 00:25:39,740
11 mm-hmm

513
00:25:39,740 --> 00:25:45,020
And they run off terrified of you guys. I'm going to tell some sort of old God. We're so scary

514
00:25:45,020 --> 00:25:47,020
I thought there's thing old guard

515
00:25:47,020 --> 00:25:50,700
Old God

516
00:25:50,700 --> 00:25:55,140
Testament so you guys we don't know that defeated Kane and it could just be guys named Kane and Abel

517
00:25:55,140 --> 00:25:59,780
Are you joking this could they could be headed to of course their head now?

518
00:25:59,780 --> 00:26:04,940
You beat them for now. They ran for now. These fuckers are gonna make a return

519
00:26:04,940 --> 00:26:08,340
Yeah, you know they are you head to the city of the elves

520
00:26:08,340 --> 00:26:11,300
So everyone pull up their poem

521
00:26:11,300 --> 00:26:14,260
I

522
00:26:14,260 --> 00:26:17,100
Got it bitch. I got it - okay

523
00:26:17,100 --> 00:26:21,620
Leaving us a desert so hot and dry and facing such foes

524
00:26:21,820 --> 00:26:29,100
We're in luck. We're alive another wise man did speak and spoke with concern those brothers were strange murderous

525
00:26:29,100 --> 00:26:35,300
Unlearned but reaching the city was oh such a joy for the city of elves is filled up with toys

526
00:26:35,300 --> 00:26:41,500
the elves do work from morning till night to make balls and dice and checkers and kites and Legos and yo-yos and

527
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:44,120
Slinkys and clay and teddies and edgies at sketchy hooray

528
00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:49,620
This is gonna be such a fucking struggle away to the king the elf king knows all

529
00:26:50,500 --> 00:26:52,740
But first they wanted to shop at the mall

530
00:26:52,740 --> 00:26:58,780
Remember this world had no presence to give buying and selling was all that folks did and malls are so dope

531
00:26:58,780 --> 00:27:01,500
I love the mall. This will be awesome. Let's shop till we fall

532
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:08,100
So there sounds good to me. You were a rhymer. I was I didn't know your secret hidden talent

533
00:27:08,100 --> 00:27:11,660
Sucian Sucian for shizu doc D. And

534
00:27:11,660 --> 00:27:14,940
It's so doc T and doc

535
00:27:16,660 --> 00:27:20,660
collecting in the wayfare final hours minutes or left on the sale. So you

536
00:27:20,660 --> 00:27:25,360
guys are at the mall in the elf kingdom. They do sell ball dice checkers

537
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:28,860
kites Legos yo-yo slinkies clay teddies and that just sketches. They're all

538
00:27:28,860 --> 00:27:31,660
each of those are two silver piece. They also sell health potions worth 10

539
00:27:31,660 --> 00:27:35,660
silver piece. You have 32 say help potion health potions about help potion.

540
00:27:35,660 --> 00:27:38,960
They have 10 so help each of those are worth 10 silver. You guys all have

541
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:44,060
30 silver. Yeah, each of you have 30 silver is how many silver pieces all

542
00:27:44,060 --> 00:27:45,360
Is that a biblical reference?

543
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:48,280
Was it? Didn't Jesus get sold out by Judas for a certain amount?

544
00:27:48,280 --> 00:27:48,820
Twelve.

545
00:27:48,820 --> 00:27:49,440
Three?

546
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:51,760
I think it was three or thirty or something.

547
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:52,420
You know what?

548
00:27:52,420 --> 00:27:53,140
Whatever you say.

549
00:27:53,140 --> 00:27:54,800
Twelve, I think of the number of apostles.

550
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:56,200
Yeah, but wasn't it one?

551
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:57,660
One per apostle.

552
00:27:57,660 --> 00:27:59,060
I forgot the amount.

553
00:27:59,060 --> 00:28:00,280
Why would they chip in?

554
00:28:00,280 --> 00:28:01,300
They all chipped in.

555
00:28:01,300 --> 00:28:02,320
One bad egg.

556
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:03,340
Tomorrow's the carton.

557
00:28:03,340 --> 00:28:05,860
It was thirty pieces of silver.

558
00:28:05,860 --> 00:28:07,880
Thirty pieces of silver.

559
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:08,100
Yeah.

560
00:28:08,100 --> 00:28:10,020
It's exactly what he gave each of us.

561
00:28:10,020 --> 00:28:12,340
And what does that signify for our characters?

562
00:28:12,340 --> 00:28:13,360
That is scary.

563
00:28:13,740 --> 00:28:17,500
you know, it's that was that intentional. It actually was not. I wish it was it

564
00:28:17,500 --> 00:28:17,660
was

565
00:28:17,660 --> 00:28:24,060
unconscious mind. Yes, this is always trying to tear down the Bible, even

566
00:28:24,060 --> 00:28:29,420
Catholic by the way in it. I love Jesus Catholic, not a real Christian. Okay,

567
00:28:29,420 --> 00:28:33,660
that I don't want to hear completely true Roman Catholic going to hell more

568
00:28:33,660 --> 00:28:39,660
Christian. Deifies Mary deifies Mary. Okay, well, fuck you. Yep, and we're done.

569
00:28:40,540 --> 00:28:44,180
You know what's scary is the scene in Passion of the Christ where Judas kills himself.

570
00:28:44,180 --> 00:28:47,540
Oh yeah, when there's all those crows bugging at his face.

571
00:28:47,540 --> 00:28:48,700
You guys gonna buy anything?

572
00:28:48,700 --> 00:28:49,700
I want three health potions.

573
00:28:49,700 --> 00:28:51,700
What, I mean, what, there's fucking nothing?

574
00:28:51,700 --> 00:28:52,980
There's toys and health potions.

575
00:28:52,980 --> 00:28:55,140
I'm gonna buy a purple limo.

576
00:28:55,140 --> 00:28:56,460
I'm gonna buy a toy to see how it-

577
00:28:56,460 --> 00:28:57,460
There's no purple limo.

578
00:28:57,460 --> 00:28:59,180
Okay, then I want nothing.

579
00:28:59,180 --> 00:29:03,060
I'm gonna buy a toy to see how it stacks up against the shit we're making back north.

580
00:29:03,060 --> 00:29:04,060
Alright, cool.

581
00:29:04,060 --> 00:29:05,540
What do you want, which toy do you want to buy?

582
00:29:05,540 --> 00:29:06,540
What do you got?

583
00:29:06,540 --> 00:29:07,540
Kites, balls.

584
00:29:07,540 --> 00:29:08,540
Ball dice.

585
00:29:08,540 --> 00:29:13,940
Kites, balls, ball, dice, checkers, kites, legos, yo-yos, slinkys, clay, teddies, etch-a-sketch.

586
00:29:13,940 --> 00:29:15,440
I guess I'll take a teddy.

587
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:16,900
And there's health potions?

588
00:29:16,900 --> 00:29:17,900
How much is a teddy?

589
00:29:17,900 --> 00:29:18,900
Teddy's two silver pieces.

590
00:29:18,900 --> 00:29:21,340
Oh yeah, fucking throw it in a bag.

591
00:29:21,340 --> 00:29:22,340
Done.

592
00:29:22,340 --> 00:29:23,780
Yeah, and yes, there are health potions.

593
00:29:23,780 --> 00:29:24,780
What else is there?

594
00:29:24,780 --> 00:29:25,780
There's health potions and...

595
00:29:25,780 --> 00:29:26,780
That's it.

596
00:29:26,780 --> 00:29:28,220
Why are you just leaking?

597
00:29:28,220 --> 00:29:29,220
Keeping track of my silver.

598
00:29:29,220 --> 00:29:31,220
I like the idea of like...

599
00:29:31,220 --> 00:29:34,020
Oh you must, where's the rest of the list you have?

600
00:29:34,020 --> 00:29:35,020
Yeah.

601
00:29:35,020 --> 00:29:36,020
No, that's it.

602
00:29:36,020 --> 00:29:38,300
Do you have any secret menu items?

603
00:29:38,300 --> 00:29:42,220
Let's go to the next part of the party. Maybe like a teddy bear that has like...

604
00:29:42,220 --> 00:29:43,220
Oh, there's a teddy bear.

605
00:29:43,220 --> 00:29:47,740
Yeah, but like a teddy bear that like is combined with another toy.

606
00:29:47,740 --> 00:29:50,860
You can do that if you get a teddy bear and another toy and you want to combine them together.

607
00:29:50,860 --> 00:29:51,860
Is this a reference?

608
00:29:51,860 --> 00:29:54,140
No, it's more or less a...

609
00:29:54,140 --> 00:29:55,140
It's a reference to a toy you had.

610
00:29:55,140 --> 00:29:59,260
It's a reference to fast food secret menus, if anything.

611
00:29:59,260 --> 00:30:00,260
Right, yeah.

612
00:30:00,260 --> 00:30:01,260
If anything, you're doing it.

613
00:30:01,260 --> 00:30:06,100
But what about a teddy bear that is also a health potion?

614
00:30:06,100 --> 00:30:10,740
Imagine how big and opaque these sunglasses are. I feel like you're staring me in the

615
00:30:10,740 --> 00:30:14,620
face the whole time you say this. I was not looking at you. I know it really feels like

616
00:30:14,620 --> 00:30:19,900
you are just because of the size and shape of the sunglasses. So you want to pay me?

617
00:30:19,900 --> 00:30:26,960
You want to pay more for a health potion? Okay, so you remember Grandma's Soup from

618
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:34,920
Wind Waker, right? Sure. I want the equivalent of that where I combine two things, but it's

619
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:40,560
it's more expensive. I combine two things together, but it's basically two health

620
00:30:40,560 --> 00:30:45,680
potions in one jar. Okay, so you want to play Wind Waker right now? Yes. You can

621
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:49,920
go do that later, but for now you get a teddy bear. I want to combine a teddy

622
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:54,600
bear with a health potion and... And you want it to count for two. That's stupid.

623
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:58,640
The soaking, the soaking up of the... Okay, I want to put a teddy bear inside

624
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:02,560
of my health potion. This guy's inventing haggling in the year 0 A.D. But he's

625
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:05,040
haggling with you. Yeah. Why are you doing? Is you trying to play your

626
00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:07,760
character here? Is there something that you think about your character that

627
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:11,640
makes you want to do this? No, no. I blame the doo doo. Let's go. You go

628
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:15,080
to the king then. You fail to make a purchase, you get nervous

629
00:31:15,080 --> 00:31:18,860
and start making shit up. You start babbling about nothing. I wanted to

630
00:31:18,860 --> 00:31:22,400
make a... I wanted there to be a creature shop. Yeah. Well, next time

631
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:25,960
I'll put a creature shop. Maybe I put a teddy bear or a toy. Don't ask

632
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:29,280
questions. Maybe I give a toy a health potion and it comes to life.

633
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:30,760
That could have happened.

634
00:31:30,760 --> 00:31:32,260
That's what I was trying to do.

635
00:31:32,260 --> 00:31:33,760
That's not what you were trying to do.

636
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:35,260
You need to be transparent with us, man.

637
00:31:35,260 --> 00:31:36,760
You can't fucking string us along like this.

638
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:37,760
And you guys...

639
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:38,760
That's what I'm trying to do now.

640
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:39,760
Meet with the king, your old friend.

641
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:40,760
Trying to string us along?

642
00:31:40,760 --> 00:31:41,760
The Earl Conan.

643
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:42,760
Yeah, I ruined it.

644
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:43,760
The king of kings.

645
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:45,760
Or the king of elves, I should say.

646
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:46,760
Okay, king of kings.

647
00:31:46,760 --> 00:31:47,760
I know who that is.

648
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:48,760
Ah, that is God.

649
00:31:48,760 --> 00:31:49,760
He sees you guys.

650
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:50,760
And he's up above.

651
00:31:50,760 --> 00:31:53,760
Says, "Ah, my old friends."

652
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:54,760
Wassup, bitch?

653
00:31:54,760 --> 00:31:57,760
"Harold, Pikachu, and..."

654
00:31:57,760 --> 00:31:58,760
Kumau.

655
00:31:58,760 --> 00:32:06,280
M. I've never met you before in my life. Oh, I must have mistaken you for another

656
00:32:06,280 --> 00:32:13,280
friend who is also an elf. And who had the same name as him. Yes, that too.

657
00:32:13,280 --> 00:32:17,760
Oh, okay. It's a good trick though. I guess you do live in a city of elves so that

658
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:23,720
would make some sense. Yeah, I get confused. Okay. Now I hear tell that you've

659
00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:27,880
you've seen a star in the sky that gave you great pause.

660
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:30,240
Yeah, it was gay

661
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:32,160
okay,

662
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:38,160
nice one is acting gay yeah. That was a guy said all pause no

663
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:43,720
yeah. We saw a star in the sky and it was around this direction. I just

664
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:47,760
thought of a joke. Okay, well a let him say his joke and then we'll continue

665
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:51,440
star in the sky. That gave us pause. What are you talking about a guy seeing the

666
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:57,440
the moon and turning into a werewolf. Nah, that was a good one. That was good.

667
00:32:57,440 --> 00:32:58,100
No, I

668
00:32:58,100 --> 00:33:02,820
also don't say anything else. When you're going to make him give a help

669
00:33:02,820 --> 00:33:04,020
attack, it's nothing

670
00:33:04,020 --> 00:33:10,040
he doesn't have a heart. Stop worrying about him. It's nothing. See the elf

671
00:33:10,040 --> 00:33:13,340
doctor, the elf doctor, just keep bursting his head out through the way.

672
00:33:13,340 --> 00:33:16,300
Yeah, just keeps like kind of getting yeah, getting pump faked. It's like

673
00:33:16,300 --> 00:33:19,740
treating a heart attack. It's like an MPC. You take an item and they start

674
00:33:19,780 --> 00:33:22,980
hard to put it back. It must have been the wind yeah.

675
00:33:22,980 --> 00:33:32,280
He goes well. Let me consult my astro lab lab astro labia last row labia. It

676
00:33:32,280 --> 00:33:37,480
takes out the labia. He takes out Pika juice favorite thing in the world, a

677
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:43,440
big old pussy and he consults it and for all I want to get

678
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:48,140
I pull out a magnifying glass

679
00:33:48,140 --> 00:34:01,140
and he says oh my it seems a great thing is to occur the son of one center of the

680
00:34:01,140 --> 00:34:01,940
North Pole.

681
00:34:01,940 --> 00:34:03,940
Holy clap.

682
00:34:03,940 --> 00:34:09,840
I believe something will begin if you three travel and make a journey and bear

683
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:11,740
gifts for this son of Santa.

684
00:34:11,740 --> 00:34:12,740
That's crazy.

685
00:34:12,740 --> 00:34:14,640
We were already doing that right.

686
00:34:14,640 --> 00:34:15,840
Yeah, your intros.

687
00:34:15,940 --> 00:34:20,980
I realize that after the fact good, but we'll keep doing it if it's gonna do

688
00:34:20,980 --> 00:34:25,140
something okay, but pretend I was the one who came up with it right

689
00:34:25,140 --> 00:34:26,900
thanks

690
00:34:26,900 --> 00:34:35,420
and as I consult the astrolabe, I have something you don't know oh great yeah,

691
00:34:35,420 --> 00:34:35,860
I believe it.

692
00:34:35,860 --> 00:34:40,980
Well, my name's Harold, the shut well, I don't know even know who you are. I

693
00:34:41,020 --> 00:34:41,860
- Yes, that's true.

694
00:34:41,860 --> 00:34:45,220
- You must follow the star and face trials.

695
00:34:45,220 --> 00:34:49,040
In the valley of giants, you shall help the meek and feeble.

696
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:51,920
On the river, you shall help solve a riddle.

697
00:34:51,920 --> 00:34:55,140
Across the sea, you must face a great many beasts

698
00:34:55,140 --> 00:34:57,260
and over the mountain will be a great battle

699
00:34:57,260 --> 00:34:59,420
that I cannot foresee.

700
00:34:59,420 --> 00:35:02,220
- I follow the star and I go to the restraining order.

701
00:35:02,220 --> 00:35:04,060
- You must bear gifts though

702
00:35:04,060 --> 00:35:06,820
and recognize the son of Santa as king.

703
00:35:06,820 --> 00:35:07,660
- It was Clay Aiken.

704
00:35:07,660 --> 00:35:10,940
- It is the only way to bring about a new age.

705
00:35:10,940 --> 00:35:13,240
this is what my labia says.

706
00:35:13,240 --> 00:35:22,860
Okay, go forth to the valley of the giants. It's just yonder we had yonder

707
00:35:22,860 --> 00:35:28,500
okay. We have an old timey GPS that says yonder. That's funny. Now, write that

708
00:35:28,500 --> 00:35:31,180
down. That is funny yonder. All right, so

709
00:35:31,180 --> 00:35:33,660
yonder can you my

710
00:35:33,660 --> 00:35:35,500
cubit

711
00:35:36,940 --> 00:35:40,820
A cubits really short actually. Please proceed to the route. Go yonder.

712
00:35:40,820 --> 00:35:44,340
Yonder. Open up your documents. Go yon.

713
00:35:44,340 --> 00:35:50,620
They met with Errol Caining. Errol Caning? Rerouting. Go forth. Errol Caning,

714
00:35:50,620 --> 00:35:54,900
right? Caning. They met with Errol Caning. The king said his thing and his

715
00:35:54,900 --> 00:35:58,220
thing was to sing. Just kidding. He talked about kings, but not him the

716
00:35:58,220 --> 00:36:02,540
king. A new kind of king, a baby king thing with an inch ding a long

717
00:36:02,780 --> 00:36:04,220
pinging his bing.

718
00:36:04,220 --> 00:36:06,100
The son of Santa, king of kings,

719
00:36:06,100 --> 00:36:08,380
king of Christmas, the toys he'll bring.

720
00:36:08,380 --> 00:36:09,620
- I want a ball!

721
00:36:09,620 --> 00:36:10,540
- I want a doll.

722
00:36:10,540 --> 00:36:11,900
- I want a doll.

723
00:36:11,900 --> 00:36:12,820
- The gall!

724
00:36:12,820 --> 00:36:15,020
These magi were smitten with toys and fun,

725
00:36:15,020 --> 00:36:17,980
but no toys will be had without a journey begun.

726
00:36:17,980 --> 00:36:19,660
Through the valley of giants, down the river,

727
00:36:19,660 --> 00:36:21,900
across the sea, through many a trial,

728
00:36:21,900 --> 00:36:24,180
then a mountain so steep, but from there,

729
00:36:24,180 --> 00:36:27,460
the North Pole, where the young king we hope sleeps.

730
00:36:27,460 --> 00:36:29,900
- Have you guys ever gone to third base?

731
00:36:29,900 --> 00:36:30,940
- It's like...

732
00:36:30,940 --> 00:36:36,080
Yes, I'm a I've had many women in my time. I'm old. That's awesome.

733
00:36:36,080 --> 00:36:41,760
Never been to third base. You the women of candy kingdom would make your eyes

734
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:44,980
pop out of your head. They're gorgeous. Oh,

735
00:36:44,980 --> 00:36:51,320
even now, as an old geezer, I can't help but I want to see a candy, but

736
00:36:51,320 --> 00:36:55,020
what can this but we don't have but

737
00:36:56,380 --> 00:37:00,920
I prove it to us. I turn around. I got no, but he doesn't. I go right on my

738
00:37:00,920 --> 00:37:04,440
God, imagine what that woman would look like with no but this is what I was

739
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:08,580
inside came before. When I shit it, it came out of my mouth. Do the girls have

740
00:37:08,580 --> 00:37:16,200
just one hole? Yeah, oh God, it's cool. We'll out the GPS and the kingdom for

741
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:20,220
us. First base is touching the hole. What second base? Oh, like

742
00:37:20,220 --> 00:37:22,020
holding hands.

743
00:37:22,940 --> 00:37:27,900
third, I guess eating each other is the only one fourth base, but the home run

744
00:37:27,900 --> 00:37:28,840
you guys to

745
00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:32,020
you blow my mind

746
00:37:32,020 --> 00:37:38,380
they have a triangle baseball

747
00:37:38,380 --> 00:37:44,620
in candy kingdom. You come to this realization, you come up on the valley

748
00:37:44,620 --> 00:37:49,180
of the giants, you're like one and you see that the valley of the giants isn't

749
00:37:49,220 --> 00:37:53,540
Valley of the Giants no more. You see the giants are laid dead in the ground,

750
00:37:53,540 --> 00:37:57,620
almost all of them. Oh my god I want to see a giant woman's butt!

751
00:37:57,620 --> 00:38:04,460
She's there, she's dead. There's only one giant left. And his name is poor

752
00:38:04,460 --> 00:38:10,460
Goliath and he's being tormented by these tiny little Davids. Goliath is

753
00:38:10,460 --> 00:38:14,620
he's going like me somebody help me and all the David's going.

754
00:38:14,620 --> 00:38:24,980
Well, normally I'd be on the side of the Davids, but I guess on this eve, I will

755
00:38:24,980 --> 00:38:27,100
destroy them. What are you guys going to do?

756
00:38:27,100 --> 00:38:34,100
Wait, wait, wait, wait, I'll run guys as the master tactician. I've I've crushed

757
00:38:34,100 --> 00:38:38,380
them countless nation states in the candy wars that I've ground infants

758
00:38:38,420 --> 00:38:44,340
my boot. I know how to approach a situation like this. The clear situation is to pick

759
00:38:44,340 --> 00:38:46,900
the side that's winning and side with them.

760
00:38:46,900 --> 00:38:49,220
Okay, so which side would that be?

761
00:38:49,220 --> 00:38:51,860
There's more of the little guys, so why not choose their side?

762
00:38:51,860 --> 00:38:54,260
Look, I don't care how long as long as I get delayed.

763
00:38:54,260 --> 00:38:57,860
And we're a little anyway. I mean, Pikachu here's 5'2".

764
00:38:57,860 --> 00:39:04,180
Okay, alright, we'll be on the side of the... he dances. We'll be on the side of the Davids

765
00:39:04,180 --> 00:39:06,500
then. Alright, I would like to attack Goliath.

766
00:39:06,500 --> 00:39:10,100
Okay, cool. Roll initiative. All three of you, roll initiative.

767
00:39:10,100 --> 00:39:14,540
Fuck me, man. A fucking Nat 29.

768
00:39:14,540 --> 00:39:15,780
- Seven. - Nat 20.

769
00:39:15,780 --> 00:39:18,100
- Nat 20, y'all. - Got a nine, dude.

770
00:39:18,100 --> 00:39:19,940
- Nat 20, y'all. - Nat 20, y'all.

771
00:39:19,940 --> 00:39:21,940
- Nat 20, y'all. Nat, Nat 20, y'all.

772
00:39:21,940 --> 00:39:25,380
- That could be a good song. - 20, 20, 20, 20, 20, y'all.

773
00:39:25,380 --> 00:39:28,500
- 10, 10, 10, 10, plus 20, y'all. - What'd you get? Sorry, one?

774
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:33,180
- Asshole. A nine. - I was actually asking.

775
00:39:33,180 --> 00:39:35,180
- Oh, what'd you get? A one? - I'm sorry.

776
00:39:35,180 --> 00:39:37,580
And what did you get Pikachu?

777
00:39:37,580 --> 00:39:38,580
Seven.

778
00:39:38,580 --> 00:39:40,580
Yeah, it's lower.

779
00:39:40,580 --> 00:39:45,260
Wait, seven plus six.

780
00:39:45,260 --> 00:39:46,260
Which would be?

781
00:39:46,260 --> 00:39:47,260
For initiative, yeah, thirteen.

782
00:39:47,260 --> 00:39:48,260
Don't make him do it.

783
00:39:48,260 --> 00:39:49,260
Don't bail him out, Patches.

784
00:39:49,260 --> 00:39:52,380
No, I know it's thirteen, because six plus six is twelve plus one.

785
00:39:52,380 --> 00:39:53,380
Bitch.

786
00:39:53,380 --> 00:39:56,180
A little peek behind the curtain.

787
00:39:56,180 --> 00:39:58,180
Piece of shit.

788
00:39:58,180 --> 00:39:59,180
Alright, M&M.

789
00:39:59,180 --> 00:40:00,180
Remember the M&M.

790
00:40:00,180 --> 00:40:02,740
Okay, I'm doing it this time.

791
00:40:02,740 --> 00:40:03,740
This time it's going to work.

792
00:40:03,740 --> 00:40:06,960
you're getting up in his mouth. You're going to get he's huge. He could

793
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:10,580
swallow me. I'm a normal size. I'm an to him. I imagine yeah he does not

794
00:40:10,580 --> 00:40:15,100
resist. Okay, I'm in there. Yeah, he's well, you know, I mean yeah, yeah, I

795
00:40:15,100 --> 00:40:15,700
keep getting there.

796
00:40:15,700 --> 00:40:19,860
It's going to be a problem. Okay, I'm in there. All right, you're in there.

797
00:40:19,860 --> 00:40:20,200
So

798
00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:23,980
again, you guys hear me just make that speech about how we should fight and

799
00:40:23,980 --> 00:40:27,460
kill this guy and I just climb into his mouth. I was crawling up his body like a

800
00:40:27,460 --> 00:40:28,580
spider. Fuck yeah,

801
00:40:28,580 --> 00:40:32,940
I'm just go. You just he's gone sexual. See the Davids and they're like they're

802
00:40:32,980 --> 00:40:37,280
that guy's a freak and they started out. They like him yeah, I like they see my

803
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:39,700
I speak out of a certain ego. I go, you know it

804
00:40:39,700 --> 00:40:45,760
what he sold what we're doing is going to be a legal okay in the Bible. One of

805
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:51,580
the Davids did manage to hit the Goliath and he got wow damn he got a ten damn

806
00:40:51,580 --> 00:40:57,740
okay. So he just goes up to the Goliath kicking his Goliath like oh my shins. Oh

807
00:40:57,740 --> 00:41:01,340
we are we are we is this David's like yeah, fuck you yeah and starts kicking

808
00:41:01,360 --> 00:41:05,000
him in the show. I is such a bitch. Yeah, yeah, I think we sided with the right

809
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:07,020
people. Real shit. You get your up

810
00:41:07,020 --> 00:41:15,240
what I'm gonna do. I mean, I saw I saw him go down his throat and I've never

811
00:41:15,240 --> 00:41:16,560
seen him go down to like a

812
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:22,260
I've never seen him get eaten by somebody that was like proportionate to

813
00:41:22,260 --> 00:41:26,360
his size and it unlocks something in me and I have to sit down.

814
00:41:27,240 --> 00:41:31,880
Jesus, give your turn. You will do anything to avoid using these abilities

815
00:41:31,880 --> 00:41:37,240
you've been given. But what happens... That's good, I really nagged him that

816
00:41:37,240 --> 00:41:41,280
time, is... Let me guess, it's a made up attack that's not on your cheek? No,

817
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:43,600
there's... My cheeks shoot out a thunder wave.

818
00:41:43,600 --> 00:41:47,280
You don't have a thunder wave. He does have a thunder wave. Oh, you do. I

819
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:48,760
paralyze everybody around me.

820
00:41:48,760 --> 00:41:52,800
Or actually, just the Goliath. They beat it. The Goliath does resist it.

821
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:53,680
Ah, damn it.

822
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:55,760
Back to drawing.

823
00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:58,000
(laughter)

824
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:01,640
- If Goliath resists it, then...

825
00:42:01,640 --> 00:42:05,060
- What do I even do in this scenario?

826
00:42:05,060 --> 00:42:05,900
- You can just move.

827
00:42:05,900 --> 00:42:06,820
- Move your turns over.

828
00:42:06,820 --> 00:42:09,700
- Yeah, but, okay, then I roll around in the sand.

829
00:42:09,700 --> 00:42:11,380
(laughter)

830
00:42:11,380 --> 00:42:12,800
- Sand in the valley.

831
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:13,940
(laughter)

832
00:42:13,940 --> 00:42:16,480
- I try to get rid of my boner by--

833
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:18,180
- From the dead Goliath woman?

834
00:42:18,180 --> 00:42:21,060
- No, no, from him going down the Goliath's throat.

835
00:42:21,060 --> 00:42:22,120
- Oh.

836
00:42:22,120 --> 00:42:22,960
- Because it unlocks something in me.

837
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:23,800
- Yeah, I got that.

838
00:42:23,800 --> 00:42:24,620
- I didn't.

839
00:42:24,620 --> 00:42:29,080
like you guys don't frequent rule thirty four. I not so much I roll there.

840
00:42:29,080 --> 00:42:30,020
We're on a hill right

841
00:42:30,020 --> 00:42:35,980
it's a battle. We crested okay, then I run to the top of the valley. I like a

842
00:42:35,980 --> 00:42:37,920
sardine and then I roll all the way down

843
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:41,380
to get rid of the boner yeah and you go

844
00:42:41,380 --> 00:42:51,200
different kind of is really right. I'm not is really I'm a Pikachu. You're

845
00:42:52,180 --> 00:42:56,340
it was a character that was is really I never said it as his homeland. I

846
00:42:56,340 --> 00:43:01,320
was saying what's going on. Okay, it was in zero. It was a throwaway joke in

847
00:43:01,320 --> 00:43:03,140
the last campaign. It doesn't have to stay.

848
00:43:03,140 --> 00:43:08,200
Well, you're stuck with it. All right, fine, then I eat tabouli and I eat

849
00:43:08,200 --> 00:43:13,200
hummus and I and that's all you do. Harold, what's up? I would like to

850
00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:15,380
it's really my only thing. Well,

851
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:22,800
Is Goliath, would you say that he is rapidly running back and forth anywhere?

852
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:27,040
He could be goaded into doing that.

853
00:43:27,040 --> 00:43:28,040
He could be goaded.

854
00:43:28,040 --> 00:43:31,040
Is he aggressive? Is he chasing the people attacking him?

855
00:43:31,040 --> 00:43:32,040
Yeah, I feel like we should have.

856
00:43:32,040 --> 00:43:33,040
Or has he fully thought about that before?

857
00:43:33,040 --> 00:43:34,040
No, he's going like, "Ooooh!"

858
00:43:34,040 --> 00:43:35,040
He could be goaded.

859
00:43:35,040 --> 00:43:37,040
He could be goaded and we should have maybe allied.

860
00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:38,040
There'll be other times where that move will be used.

861
00:43:38,040 --> 00:43:40,040
Alright, I'm going to do the icicle attack again then.

862
00:43:40,040 --> 00:43:41,040
Alright, go for it.

863
00:43:41,040 --> 00:43:43,040
Thirteen.

864
00:43:43,040 --> 00:43:46,040
Yeah, thirteen total? You added it in two?

865
00:43:46,040 --> 00:43:47,040
Yeah.

866
00:43:47,040 --> 00:43:52,720
yeah, that doesn't hit well. I'm going to take a break. Okay, all right, it's

867
00:43:52,720 --> 00:43:55,800
back to me. Sorry, go live stern. Oh, goliath is going to try to start

868
00:43:55,800 --> 00:43:57,340
smashing the Davids around him.

869
00:43:57,340 --> 00:44:02,260
He does a terrible job. We pick the right side. Everything is such an idiot.

870
00:44:02,260 --> 00:44:07,840
How many? How many Davids are there? How many Davids? Yes, there are three

871
00:44:07,840 --> 00:44:10,400
Davids right now, beating him up. There's only three. I thought there was

872
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:13,200
way more and it's the only reason I thought there was like twenty. Yeah,

873
00:44:13,320 --> 00:44:14,660
It's the only reason I chose...

874
00:44:14,660 --> 00:44:15,940
There are other Davids around.

875
00:44:15,940 --> 00:44:17,700
There's three right now fighting him.

876
00:44:17,700 --> 00:44:18,700
Three David crosses.

877
00:44:18,700 --> 00:44:19,700
Yeah.

878
00:44:19,700 --> 00:44:22,780
They're telling him that this war in the Middle East is fucked up and bullshit.

879
00:44:22,780 --> 00:44:23,780
Yeah.

880
00:44:23,780 --> 00:44:25,100
George Bush is a cunt.

881
00:44:25,100 --> 00:44:26,100
Yeah.

882
00:44:26,100 --> 00:44:31,140
That is the kind of thing he says.

883
00:44:31,140 --> 00:44:33,700
He smashes two of the three Davids to smithereens.

884
00:44:33,700 --> 00:44:34,700
What?

885
00:44:34,700 --> 00:44:37,540
So there's just one David?

886
00:44:37,540 --> 00:44:38,940
There will be two more coming in.

887
00:44:38,940 --> 00:44:39,940
Okay.

888
00:44:39,940 --> 00:44:40,940
Oh, okay.

889
00:44:40,940 --> 00:44:41,940
You guys are scaring me.

890
00:44:41,940 --> 00:44:42,940
Endless vibes.

891
00:44:42,940 --> 00:44:47,220
could have been goaded and we should have. All right. Is it my turn? Okay.

892
00:44:47,220 --> 00:44:48,140
Candy punch

893
00:44:48,140 --> 00:44:54,700
10. Okay. Does not hit getting not so good rolls. Yeah. Oh, that's my turn.

894
00:44:54,700 --> 00:44:57,300
I'm still just in there. Oh, I guess I have to take damage. Yeah. Take two

895
00:44:57,300 --> 00:44:58,140
damage.

896
00:44:58,140 --> 00:45:03,420
Now it is David's turn.

897
00:45:03,420 --> 00:45:07,060
So two of them show up so they don't do anything just yet. They just show up.

898
00:45:07,060 --> 00:45:10,340
So one of them tries to attack seven. He misses.

899
00:45:11,100 --> 00:45:16,020
Thanks for reading. It was your eyes were over there. Yeah, it's a good point.

900
00:45:16,020 --> 00:45:21,060
You're well your turn. So, okay. So now that there's sand all over my penis,

901
00:45:21,060 --> 00:45:26,500
always in a different, just like a different game. Huh? Keep going.

902
00:45:26,500 --> 00:45:32,140
All over my penis. I've become enraged and I shoot a light,

903
00:45:32,140 --> 00:45:36,900
a thunderbolt at the Goliath immediately. Go for it. Yeah.

904
00:45:36,900 --> 00:45:39,740
Because I'm mad that the, the sand on your penis. Yeah.

905
00:45:39,740 --> 00:45:41,040
that sucks into my penis.

906
00:45:41,040 --> 00:45:42,340
Oh,

907
00:45:42,340 --> 00:45:46,340
that was that was for people not watching the video playing on the edge.

908
00:45:46,340 --> 00:45:50,740
You can roll that on probably could have been an inch of room on the table

909
00:45:50,740 --> 00:45:54,540
that he not fully rolled the entire thing on pretty crazy. The least the

910
00:45:54,540 --> 00:45:59,040
dice has ever a die is removed. That's like it. That was like a genuine role

911
00:45:59,040 --> 00:46:03,240
with that was God's hand. I was crazy putting it. I was about I was supposed

912
00:46:03,240 --> 00:46:05,040
to roll that Thunderbolt. That was real.

913
00:46:05,040 --> 00:46:08,140
Wow. Yeah, roll to D ten

914
00:46:09,140 --> 00:46:11,120
Which one? Almost man. It is this one.

915
00:46:11,120 --> 00:46:14,940
No, it's the one with the nine on it. Yes. Yes.

916
00:46:14,940 --> 00:46:20,380
Okay. 44. That's pretty cool.

917
00:46:20,380 --> 00:46:25,180
So that's eight plus two. So that's 10 damage. Um, and uh, yeah,

918
00:46:25,180 --> 00:46:26,540
it was pretty good. That Goliath was like,

919
00:46:26,540 --> 00:46:29,460
Oh that Goliath.

920
00:46:29,460 --> 00:46:32,860
Cause he's in his mouth. No, no. Why would you bring that up? He's chilling.

921
00:46:32,860 --> 00:46:35,500
No, I thought about that. I was like, I was like, I'm already,

922
00:46:36,020 --> 00:46:39,520
I already gave him some DOT, he doesn't need to have damage also from that.

923
00:46:39,520 --> 00:46:40,220
Unless it's too...

924
00:46:40,220 --> 00:46:42,420
They all standing my penis because of what?

925
00:46:42,420 --> 00:46:45,520
I saw you eat him, my friend.

926
00:46:45,520 --> 00:46:46,820
Bitch.

927
00:46:46,820 --> 00:46:49,820
Goliath is not looking good, by the way.

928
00:46:49,820 --> 00:46:50,320
Okay.

929
00:46:50,320 --> 00:46:52,020
And you're not even looking good.

930
00:46:52,020 --> 00:46:53,320
It is Harold's turn, yes.

931
00:46:53,320 --> 00:46:53,820
All right.

932
00:46:53,820 --> 00:46:54,720
I am going to...

933
00:46:54,720 --> 00:46:55,120
I don't know.

934
00:46:55,120 --> 00:46:57,120
I'm hoping this gives me some kind of advantage.

935
00:46:57,120 --> 00:46:59,720
I know about Goliath.

936
00:46:59,720 --> 00:47:02,020
Not my character, but me as a person.

937
00:47:02,020 --> 00:47:02,520
Yeah.

938
00:47:02,520 --> 00:47:04,820
And Goliath has a weak-ass forehead.

939
00:47:05,220 --> 00:47:08,880
his forehead, one single rock can kill this animal. It's an overactive

940
00:47:08,880 --> 00:47:11,680
pituitary gland is what they say. It must be some kind of third eye

941
00:47:11,680 --> 00:47:17,120
abomination. So I am going to specifically target his forehead. Hey,

942
00:47:17,120 --> 00:47:18,400
okay, I'll give you Bible points.

943
00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:24,900
Reroll it anyway. Thank God. Yeah. Okay, good. Oh yeah. Wow. That no,

944
00:47:24,900 --> 00:47:26,980
leave that dice on the floor. That is, that's a

945
00:47:26,980 --> 00:47:29,840
dice.

946
00:47:32,520 --> 00:47:35,080
eliminate the natural one dice out of the look at

947
00:47:35,080 --> 00:47:38,400
twenty not net twenty but blame me anymore.

948
00:47:38,400 --> 00:47:41,400
Thirty twenty think about yeah. All right yeah that's a that's

949
00:47:41,400 --> 00:47:42,840
that's for sure a hit.

950
00:47:42,840 --> 00:47:47,520
Okay roll God roll five D sixes like five

951
00:47:47,520 --> 00:47:50,480
D sixes. That is one D eight plus three.

952
00:47:50,480 --> 00:47:52,880
But OK. No because you're doing the stone to his

953
00:47:52,880 --> 00:47:55,280
forehead. You are so right. You're doing the Jesus move.

954
00:47:55,280 --> 00:47:57,400
I need book. Jesus didn't do that.

955
00:47:57,400 --> 00:47:59,640
A book. It was David. It was David.

956
00:47:59,640 --> 00:48:01,600
I'm stealing people's dice.

957
00:48:01,600 --> 00:48:04,140
You're gonna blow a lot of David's minds right now.

958
00:48:04,140 --> 00:48:07,940
Five, one, that's six, 16, 18.

959
00:48:07,940 --> 00:48:11,440
Yeah, describe your biblical killing.

960
00:48:11,440 --> 00:48:12,440
Damn.

961
00:48:12,440 --> 00:48:17,360
I take out my ice slingshot or... He didn't use a slingshot, did he?

962
00:48:17,360 --> 00:48:18,480
Yeah. He used a sling.

963
00:48:18,480 --> 00:48:19,480
It was a sling.

964
00:48:19,480 --> 00:48:20,480
It's called a sling.

965
00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:21,480
So it's like a...

966
00:48:21,480 --> 00:48:27,020
I take out my ice sling that I have and I roll it around plenty of times.

967
00:48:27,400 --> 00:48:35,340
And I shoot an ice sickle at maximum speed over 10 miles an hour directly at

968
00:48:35,340 --> 00:48:39,360
his forehead. And I hit it and he shatters into a million pieces. Yeah.

969
00:48:39,360 --> 00:48:42,600
And out you come and now you come. It looks like you were. It looks like you

970
00:48:42,600 --> 00:48:48,800
were wearing him. I'm having a nightmare. Wake up. Wake the fuck up. Come on.

971
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:53,200
Wake up, bitch. You see the Davids. They can't do you. That was amazing. We're

972
00:48:53,200 --> 00:48:54,200
We're gonna start doing that.

973
00:48:54,200 --> 00:48:55,200
Thank you.

974
00:48:55,200 --> 00:48:58,840
You can't do it because you don't have any, there's no ice, right?

975
00:48:58,840 --> 00:49:01,360
There's something called copulite, bitch, and you cannot steal his moles.

976
00:49:01,360 --> 00:49:03,400
You can't just copy my attacks.

977
00:49:03,400 --> 00:49:04,400
That's right.

978
00:49:04,400 --> 00:49:06,320
Damn it.

979
00:49:06,320 --> 00:49:08,920
Well we thank you for ridding us of the last giant.

980
00:49:08,920 --> 00:49:11,360
Now we can do shit to their bodies.

981
00:49:11,360 --> 00:49:13,120
What were we supposed to do in the Valley of Giants?

982
00:49:13,120 --> 00:49:14,120
Go past it.

983
00:49:14,120 --> 00:49:15,120
To the next area.

984
00:49:15,120 --> 00:49:17,760
Okay, so we're going to go past you now.

985
00:49:17,760 --> 00:49:18,760
Thank you so much.

986
00:49:18,760 --> 00:49:22,400
I think the poem said, "Don't regard any moral."

987
00:49:22,400 --> 00:49:26,200
In the Valley of Giants, you shall help the meek and feeble, was what I said.

988
00:49:26,200 --> 00:49:27,200
So that's tough because...

989
00:49:27,200 --> 00:49:28,200
So meek just like means small, right?

990
00:49:28,200 --> 00:49:29,200
Meek means small, yeah.

991
00:49:29,200 --> 00:49:30,200
Because it's like, "Meek, meek, meek, meek!"

992
00:49:30,200 --> 00:49:31,200
Like a mouse!

993
00:49:31,200 --> 00:49:32,200
Yeah, a mouse's sound is meek.

994
00:49:32,200 --> 00:49:33,200
"Meek, meek, meek, meek, meek!"

995
00:49:33,200 --> 00:49:37,600
But they were not as meek as the giant because the giant seemed shy.

996
00:49:37,600 --> 00:49:38,600
What did he say?

997
00:49:38,600 --> 00:49:40,600
Help the meek and evil?

998
00:49:40,600 --> 00:49:42,200
Feeble, but they were feeble.

999
00:49:42,200 --> 00:49:44,200
I'm pretty sure he said evil.

1000
00:49:44,200 --> 00:49:47,200
He said help them meet the feebles and they were actually bad.

1001
00:49:47,200 --> 00:49:49,200
Sorry, I only have one hole I hear out of my mouth.

1002
00:49:49,200 --> 00:49:52,200
You don't have ears?

1003
00:49:52,200 --> 00:49:53,400
I know, but yeah,

1004
00:49:53,400 --> 00:50:00,520
no room for you. He is why? Why did God give you eyebrows, but no ears?

1005
00:50:00,520 --> 00:50:04,280
Eyebrows are helpful to keep sand out of my eyes. I don't have eyelashes

1006
00:50:04,280 --> 00:50:05,320
because I'm not a girl.

1007
00:50:05,320 --> 00:50:09,760
We don't believe in evolution yet.

1008
00:50:09,760 --> 00:50:14,040
Wait and then I like

1009
00:50:14,040 --> 00:50:18,680
that is going to lock your world in two thousand and eight. Where would the

1010
00:50:18,680 --> 00:50:22,680
There's gonna be a man called Bill Maher who will walk your world.

1011
00:50:22,680 --> 00:50:25,180
So you guys, 2008 is what your fixated on.

1012
00:50:25,180 --> 00:50:26,380
Well, they do list.

1013
00:50:26,380 --> 00:50:30,680
And so you guys move past, you guys don't even have to take this out for this one.

1014
00:50:30,680 --> 00:50:32,880
You guys don't have any lines in this one.

1015
00:50:32,880 --> 00:50:33,580
Oh, okay.

1016
00:50:33,580 --> 00:50:34,180
Fuck you.

1017
00:50:34,180 --> 00:50:37,180
The trial of the giants was hard fought and won.

1018
00:50:37,180 --> 00:50:39,880
Who knew freaks so tiny could be such bums?

1019
00:50:39,880 --> 00:50:43,380
You know that they're evil, five seven or smaller.

1020
00:50:43,380 --> 00:50:45,380
We were supposed to kill the Davids.

1021
00:50:45,380 --> 00:50:46,180
It's fine.

1022
00:50:46,580 --> 00:50:48,740
just look at women who tend to be shorter

1023
00:50:48,740 --> 00:50:53,900
Latinos, Italians, Spaniards are these and don't get me started on the God

1024
00:50:53,900 --> 00:50:58,820
damn Chinese, with their big bushy tails and ears so long they trample my garden

1025
00:50:58,820 --> 00:51:02,460
while hopping along. You're thinking of rabbits man. Oh shit,

1026
00:51:02,460 --> 00:51:08,260
you're really thinking of rap or squirrels. Maybe yeah, that line big

1027
00:51:08,260 --> 00:51:09,460
bushy. You know, let me

1028
00:51:09,460 --> 00:51:13,340
rabbits have bushy tails, God damn, you have a not big ones. It doesn't

1029
00:51:13,340 --> 00:51:14,780
these, though,

1030
00:51:15,860 --> 00:51:18,360
But back to the journey of the three wise men,

1031
00:51:18,360 --> 00:51:20,060
- Aries, those goddamn Aries. - Cones, Cones.

1032
00:51:20,060 --> 00:51:22,660
- Who now reach a river with a curious bend.

1033
00:51:22,660 --> 00:51:24,620
Wide and rushing and luscious can be,

1034
00:51:24,620 --> 00:51:25,740
how will they go down it?

1035
00:51:25,740 --> 00:51:26,840
Oh, we shall see.

1036
00:51:26,840 --> 00:51:29,060
- We swam.

1037
00:51:29,060 --> 00:51:31,420
- Wait a minute. - There's a riddle.

1038
00:51:31,420 --> 00:51:33,100
They said it was a riddle, the river riddle.

1039
00:51:33,100 --> 00:51:35,180
I remember. - We make it a loft.

1040
00:51:35,180 --> 00:51:36,860
- 'Cause I was excited for the riddle.

1041
00:51:36,860 --> 00:51:38,440
- The edge of the river,

1042
00:51:38,440 --> 00:51:40,460
where you see an old hobbled man

1043
00:51:40,460 --> 00:51:44,300
with a sort of a nasty robe,

1044
00:51:44,300 --> 00:51:49,540
kind of tab I knock him out on his I just pick up Pikachu chill. I pick up the

1045
00:51:49,540 --> 00:51:52,060
first rock I see and I chill the fuck out. I

1046
00:51:52,060 --> 00:52:00,100
old man's I create an ice old man's head and I turn him into a raft. No, I

1047
00:52:00,100 --> 00:52:03,740
block it with ice. You block it with ice. Yes, I want to see what he has

1048
00:52:03,740 --> 00:52:07,860
planned here. Pikachu. Let's hear what he has to say and look closely at his

1049
00:52:07,860 --> 00:52:10,940
body. So now you're talking.

1050
00:52:12,140 --> 00:52:14,140
I want to look at this sinewy bobby.

1051
00:52:14,140 --> 00:52:19,140
And so this man introduces himself to you guys as Noah.

1052
00:52:19,140 --> 00:52:22,140
Alright, I pick up the rock again.

1053
00:52:22,140 --> 00:52:28,140
And he says, "I have a problem, if you can help me."

1054
00:52:28,140 --> 00:52:29,140
His plate's too weak.

1055
00:52:29,140 --> 00:52:31,140
Damn!

1056
00:52:31,140 --> 00:52:33,140
No, I'm kidding Noah.

1057
00:52:33,140 --> 00:52:40,280
unless I got by his way, he says you see here. I have a chicken, a fox and a

1058
00:52:40,280 --> 00:52:46,720
bag of grain and I have to bring these over across the river. Wait a minute, I

1059
00:52:46,720 --> 00:52:52,080
know this one, but if I leave the fox with the chicken, not this man, the fox

1060
00:52:52,080 --> 00:52:56,800
will eat the chicken, but if I take the chicken with the grain and leave them

1061
00:52:56,800 --> 00:53:01,040
there, the chicken will eat the grain. Okay, what do I do? I've heard this

1062
00:53:01,080 --> 00:53:05,280
turtle before and here's a question I have to ask you of course. Why do you

1063
00:53:05,280 --> 00:53:10,920
need a fox? I have one girl fox over there. I need to add this boy fox to my

1064
00:53:10,920 --> 00:53:11,360
arc.

1065
00:53:11,360 --> 00:53:13,760
What then?

1066
00:53:13,760 --> 00:53:15,320
Oh,

1067
00:53:15,320 --> 00:53:20,640
I had one trip and I grabbed the chicken. You said you know this one. I know this

1068
00:53:20,640 --> 00:53:24,120
one, but I also have been cook on it. I have a trump card,

1069
00:53:24,120 --> 00:53:30,560
which is patches, weak as plate patches, had a weak plate. It thinks that was not

1070
00:53:31,600 --> 00:53:34,860
Thanksgiving. I filled it out after and I will give me this

1071
00:53:34,860 --> 00:53:38,780
camera. Give me this one over here. Don't don't don't the me

1072
00:53:38,780 --> 00:53:43,380
camera. It was weak at the time. I then filled it out after I

1073
00:53:43,380 --> 00:53:45,500
just wanted to try a couple things. You don't have to do

1074
00:53:45,500 --> 00:53:48,180
the riddle because that plate was this guy's eating crumbs

1075
00:53:48,180 --> 00:53:53,180
for Thanksgiving. I only ate crumbs. You would expect if you

1076
00:53:53,180 --> 00:53:55,700
got tricked into having a weak ass plate that you would have

1077
00:53:55,700 --> 00:53:59,780
ate and some of it. Noah, I'm sorry. You were being you. Noah,

1078
00:53:59,780 --> 00:54:04,260
but you are Noah right now and you had a weak plate. It was very now we are

1079
00:54:04,260 --> 00:54:06,520
playing, we are doing the shame ray at you.

1080
00:54:06,520 --> 00:54:10,700
Okay, here's my solution. Here's my proposed solution. Well, Pat said he

1081
00:54:10,700 --> 00:54:13,580
knows the answer to the world. I do know. Wait, wait, wait. Okay, so it's

1082
00:54:13,580 --> 00:54:14,880
you bring over

1083
00:54:14,880 --> 00:54:19,620
it's you have the grain,

1084
00:54:19,620 --> 00:54:23,880
you can only bring one at a time, right? That's correct. It's a classic riddle.

1085
00:54:23,880 --> 00:54:24,220
Uh huh.

1086
00:54:24,220 --> 00:54:29,060
Oh, fuck. I saw this. Wait, and the fox is gonna eat the grain? I literally

1087
00:54:29,060 --> 00:54:32,840
solve this. The chicken needs the grain. Oh, then just bring over Fox grain

1088
00:54:32,840 --> 00:54:36,660
chicken. No, the chicken needs the grain. The chicken eats the grain. The fox is

1089
00:54:36,660 --> 00:54:40,100
going to start with the chicken. Okay, that's the only possible start. You

1090
00:54:40,100 --> 00:54:42,820
start with the chicken because the fox doesn't eat the grain, but the fox is

1091
00:54:42,820 --> 00:54:46,400
going to eat the chicken. No, start with the chicken. You know, you bring the

1092
00:54:46,400 --> 00:54:49,740
chicken over and then the fox and the you and then you bring one and you come

1093
00:54:49,740 --> 00:54:53,620
back with it. You come back with it. Exactly. So yeah, you bring the chicken

1094
00:54:53,620 --> 00:54:56,860
across and then you either bring the fox to the grain, but then you also take one

1095
00:54:56,900 --> 00:54:59,940
back when you come back, but I don't remember what, but I know that's what

1096
00:54:59,940 --> 00:55:01,060
the key is. What you bring

1097
00:55:01,060 --> 00:55:02,640
so

1098
00:55:02,640 --> 00:55:08,420
yep, time to draw. I just have to think about this. So you start and you need

1099
00:55:08,420 --> 00:55:13,160
to like if that's the river bro. This is literally okay. I know that for a fact

1100
00:55:13,160 --> 00:55:17,380
that patches saw this on the tick tock game. I don't play. There's a tick tock

1101
00:55:17,380 --> 00:55:21,540
game. There's a tick tock game. Forty years old. I don't have never on. I

1102
00:55:21,540 --> 00:55:24,820
thought that the weak ass plate would have knolled all of this.

1103
00:55:25,980 --> 00:55:29,820
I mean shut me up. I'll give you that way up, which I actually just feel bad about

1104
00:55:29,820 --> 00:55:34,180
way. I got it guys. I know how I thought that I thought that I would have some

1105
00:55:34,180 --> 00:55:37,140
other world. If you can fit more, how many things can you fit on the boat at

1106
00:55:37,140 --> 00:55:41,660
one time? One can only fit one thing in a guy. Okay, one grain, the guy, well,

1107
00:55:41,660 --> 00:55:45,380
the guy who's bringing the thing Fox chicken. So you bring the chicken over.

1108
00:55:45,380 --> 00:55:50,020
Okay, what should we bring next guys? Wait, so we bring the chicken over first.

1109
00:55:50,020 --> 00:55:53,620
Why'd you draw? Well, this look, I just realized this is easy. This is how we

1110
00:55:53,620 --> 00:55:58,900
you can yeah, but the you you I know I was saying I

1111
00:55:58,900 --> 00:56:02,620
thought you had a solution. I don't have a solution. I know with a step off. You

1112
00:56:02,620 --> 00:56:06,260
can't Google the solution man, all three of your role perception with

1113
00:56:06,260 --> 00:56:08,380
disadvantage. Okay, bitch,

1114
00:56:08,380 --> 00:56:12,580
that's a seven. I mean, our all my God, I got a

1115
00:56:12,580 --> 00:56:19,060
reception is brain yeah, it's owl owl yeah, then I got a seven. I got a

1116
00:56:19,060 --> 00:56:22,740
eighteen. Is that your low one advantage? They are low, oh disadvantage

1117
00:56:22,780 --> 00:56:25,280
Yeah. Okay. Wow. Wow.

1118
00:56:25,280 --> 00:56:29,420
So while you guys are puzzling over the riddle, riddle, riddle, if you,

1119
00:56:29,420 --> 00:56:32,140
if you solved it, I would have let you solve it.

1120
00:56:32,140 --> 00:56:36,140
I will solve it right now. Oh, it's just a actual Tick Tock game.

1121
00:56:36,140 --> 00:56:39,820
This is dope. Oh, wait, wait, wait. We'll eat sheep. Hold on. Oh my God.

1122
00:56:39,820 --> 00:56:44,100
To restart. You bring the Fox over. No, you bring the sheep over first.

1123
00:56:44,100 --> 00:56:46,260
Yeah. It's we bring the sheep over first.

1124
00:56:46,260 --> 00:56:48,700
I have a feeling the comments will cook us on this one. Yeah.

1125
00:56:48,700 --> 00:56:51,220
They're going to hate. I just solved it guys. No. Why would you bring, wait,

1126
00:56:51,220 --> 00:56:53,420
Wait, wait, wait, I just solved it. I just solved it. I literally just solved it.

1127
00:56:53,420 --> 00:56:55,860
Look, look, look, look. Bring the chicken over first.

1128
00:56:55,860 --> 00:56:59,460
OK, then you bring the fox over and you take the chicken back.

1129
00:56:59,460 --> 00:57:01,620
There you go. Then you bring the grain.

1130
00:57:01,620 --> 00:57:03,220
Then you come back and bring the chicken.

1131
00:57:03,220 --> 00:57:04,860
That's what it was. There we go.

1132
00:57:04,860 --> 00:57:06,360
Well, that's what it was.

1133
00:57:06,360 --> 00:57:10,460
You did solve it and you solve it for Noah and he's thankful.

1134
00:57:10,460 --> 00:57:14,820
But he also says on Thanksgiving that you are over on the other side of the river.

1135
00:57:14,820 --> 00:57:16,320
Now you two can solve it.

1136
00:57:16,320 --> 00:57:18,660
He said, now we need it. Now we need to do it with us.

1137
00:57:18,660 --> 00:57:21,020
I get to be the chicken.

1138
00:57:21,020 --> 00:57:25,580
and that why I'm an M and M, so I know I was to the food chain. I think Noah

1139
00:57:25,580 --> 00:57:32,780
says now my gorillas and two gorillas. Oh God, come on. We helped him grab

1140
00:57:32,780 --> 00:57:38,500
this M and M me who brought over and solve the riddle. I'm going to wait is

1141
00:57:38,500 --> 00:57:39,480
Noah in the water.

1142
00:57:39,480 --> 00:57:43,540
Noah is not in the war. Noah's on the other side of the river with a jump

1143
00:57:43,540 --> 00:57:48,740
across the river, the two M and M. Sorry, the two gorillas, though you might

1144
00:57:48,780 --> 00:57:51,780
I recognize them as Cain and Abel wearing gorilla outfits.

1145
00:57:51,780 --> 00:57:53,480
Oh shit, we should have killed him.

1146
00:57:53,480 --> 00:57:56,280
Wait, we should let them go on the ark so they have to have sex with each other.

1147
00:57:56,280 --> 00:57:57,280
That's his brother.

1148
00:57:57,280 --> 00:57:58,280
No, don't!

1149
00:57:58,280 --> 00:57:59,280
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!

1150
00:57:59,280 --> 00:58:01,780
These are two brothers, they're not real gorillas.

1151
00:58:01,780 --> 00:58:02,780
What?

1152
00:58:02,780 --> 00:58:03,780
Yeah, look at them.

1153
00:58:03,780 --> 00:58:05,780
Put them on the, put them on the boat.

1154
00:58:05,780 --> 00:58:07,780
You don't even have gorillas in this part of the world.

1155
00:58:07,780 --> 00:58:08,780
I pull off their gorilla masks.

1156
00:58:08,780 --> 00:58:10,780
Put them on the boat, I have an idea.

1157
00:58:10,780 --> 00:58:13,280
Why would the old god betray me like this?

1158
00:58:13,280 --> 00:58:15,280
No, we're trying to help you.

1159
00:58:15,280 --> 00:58:16,280
Please, don't!

1160
00:58:16,280 --> 00:58:20,680
wait a minute put the gorillas on their boat in them with it. Yeah,

1161
00:58:20,680 --> 00:58:23,580
we're one that we used to cross the way. I'll just go ahead and put the

1162
00:58:23,580 --> 00:58:27,200
gorillas on the boat. Okay, he does that tell them to go on the boat. I

1163
00:58:27,200 --> 00:58:30,960
guess go on the boat. Why don't you? Why do I have to do it? We put the

1164
00:58:30,960 --> 00:58:33,920
gorillas on the boat because I have an amazing idea. We'll just tell them

1165
00:58:33,920 --> 00:58:37,000
to go on the boat. Okay, you tell me to put them on the boat. He's three

1166
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:42,200
feet tall. Gorilla. If the gorillas go on the boat in the middle of the

1167
00:58:42,200 --> 00:58:44,640
say something good will happen. They're not going to do it. If there's

1168
00:58:44,660 --> 00:58:47,360
nothing that may be a maybe

1169
00:58:47,360 --> 00:58:55,460
not maybe there will be there will definitely be an amazing roll talking

1170
00:58:55,460 --> 00:59:03,760
that is a seventeen. They go pretty good yeah, yeah, your perception being able

1171
00:59:03,760 --> 00:59:07,220
to notice the gorillas and unmask them and your solid charisma check. They're

1172
00:59:07,220 --> 00:59:10,360
like all right, we're sorry, Noah, we're sorry, all right, so they're in the

1173
00:59:10,360 --> 00:59:12,920
they're in the river. They get in the boat, yeah, the in the boat and they're

1174
00:59:12,940 --> 00:59:16,340
the water. I shoot a lightning bolt into the river.

1175
00:59:16,340 --> 00:59:17,940
Okay, roll attack roll.

1176
00:59:17,940 --> 00:59:18,940
They're in a boat.

1177
00:59:18,940 --> 00:59:19,940
What's a boat made out of? Metal?

1178
00:59:19,940 --> 00:59:20,940
Mm-hmm.

1179
00:59:20,940 --> 00:59:21,940
Really?

1180
00:59:21,940 --> 00:59:22,940
Oh yeah!

1181
00:59:22,940 --> 00:59:23,940
Oh.

1182
00:59:23,940 --> 00:59:24,940
Fuck that!

1183
00:59:24,940 --> 00:59:25,940
Nine.

1184
00:59:25,940 --> 00:59:30,380
That was pretty good. That was a pretty good idea. It did not work though.

1185
00:59:30,380 --> 00:59:31,860
But I kill every single fish around.

1186
00:59:31,860 --> 00:59:33,740
You kill all the fish that come up.

1187
00:59:33,740 --> 00:59:34,740
Sentence movie.

1188
00:59:34,740 --> 00:59:42,020
And then you hear a rumbling in the back and Noah goes, "My ark! No!" And you hear a "krrk

1189
00:59:42,020 --> 00:59:46,820
as the whole arc way in the back of the woods by the river explodes.

1190
00:59:46,820 --> 00:59:49,260
You see two by two animals running out.

1191
00:59:49,260 --> 00:59:51,020
Wait, because of the electricity?

1192
00:59:51,020 --> 00:59:53,520
Wait, I thought this was your arc.

1193
00:59:53,520 --> 00:59:55,920
Explodes in the back.

1194
00:59:55,920 --> 00:59:57,820
Beefly animals!

1195
00:59:57,820 --> 01:00:00,300
No, this was just to get into the arc.

1196
01:00:00,300 --> 01:00:01,980
I'm sorry I tried to kidnap you.

1197
01:00:01,980 --> 01:00:04,060
I thought the old god was nice.

1198
01:00:04,060 --> 01:00:05,660
Beefly all the animals.

1199
01:00:05,660 --> 01:00:06,980
He thought the old god was nice.

1200
01:00:06,980 --> 01:00:08,700
Wait, why did you even try to kidnap me?

1201
01:00:08,700 --> 01:00:10,780
Is there a female M&M on the arc?

1202
01:00:10,780 --> 01:00:12,780
Well, and before he could say it,

1203
01:00:12,780 --> 01:00:16,400
he gets squished. Okay, thank God.

1204
01:00:16,400 --> 01:00:19,980
I don't want a female in a male. And you do get eaten once again,

1205
01:00:19,980 --> 01:00:24,980
but this time by a lonely whale. It's all three of you. Jonah.

1206
01:00:24,980 --> 01:00:28,980
The story of Jonah. Jonah was a prophet, ooh, ooh, but he really never

1207
01:00:28,980 --> 01:00:33,160
got it. Sad but true. But this time, the whale gets it. He gets you

1208
01:00:33,160 --> 01:00:36,800
three and you go down the gosh darn river, and you're whooshing down,

1209
01:00:36,800 --> 01:00:40,660
and you're rocking around inside the whale. What? Was it a freshwater whale?

1210
01:00:40,660 --> 01:00:44,660
from the art could swim up. He had a tank in the I would like to

1211
01:00:44,660 --> 01:00:48,000
call on the pirates who don't do anything

1212
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:53,440
yeah. They still don't do anything like the story God damn it. They just

1213
01:00:53,440 --> 01:00:57,740
throw him overboard and so he you're going down this river and then you

1214
01:00:57,740 --> 01:01:01,580
suddenly feel a drop in your stomach waterfall. You fall all the way down

1215
01:01:01,580 --> 01:01:05,600
this massive waterfall, the end of the river to the sea and boom you hit it

1216
01:01:05,600 --> 01:01:08,340
and you knock out. That'd be a good theme park right. Is there any

1217
01:01:08,880 --> 01:01:11,880
Christian theme parks that do Jonah inside there should be there is a

1218
01:01:11,880 --> 01:01:12,440
whale's mouth.

1219
01:01:12,440 --> 01:01:14,720
Ken

1220
01:01:14,720 --> 01:01:20,720
Russell, no there's this case this this Australian fella Ken something can down

1221
01:01:20,720 --> 01:01:25,720
and no he has a Tennessee can see and with a whole have a one to one version

1222
01:01:25,720 --> 01:01:29,400
of Noah's Ark. That sounds awesome. It's really silly. It does sound really

1223
01:01:29,400 --> 01:01:33,960
cool. I have an all night over money. Yeah, so you guys as you come to

1224
01:01:35,960 --> 01:01:37,080
We pull up our poem.

1225
01:01:37,080 --> 01:01:38,080
Yeah, I come too.

1226
01:01:38,080 --> 01:01:39,080
Wassup?

1227
01:01:39,080 --> 01:01:40,080
You came too?

1228
01:01:40,080 --> 01:01:41,080
I came too.

1229
01:01:41,080 --> 01:01:43,880
You came second?

1230
01:01:43,880 --> 01:01:46,880
Into the maw of the great big whale.

1231
01:01:46,880 --> 01:01:48,680
Oh, what has happened?

1232
01:01:48,680 --> 01:01:51,680
It's so dark I need braille.

1233
01:01:51,680 --> 01:01:54,920
How will we make it to the North Pole now?

1234
01:01:54,920 --> 01:01:57,320
Inside of a whale, the biggest of cows.

1235
01:01:57,320 --> 01:02:01,360
Oh, not so fast, another voice did say.

1236
01:02:01,360 --> 01:02:04,380
You're staying right here and dying today.

1237
01:02:04,380 --> 01:02:07,820
And out came a man, handsome and strong, with his five lion wives.

1238
01:02:07,820 --> 01:02:09,540
It was Daniel the Wrong.

1239
01:02:09,540 --> 01:02:10,540
What's up Daniel?

1240
01:02:10,540 --> 01:02:12,860
I know you hitting all that.

1241
01:02:12,860 --> 01:02:14,500
I know you hitting all that Daniel.

1242
01:02:14,500 --> 01:02:15,500
What's up?

1243
01:02:15,500 --> 01:02:16,500
These are all my wives.

1244
01:02:16,500 --> 01:02:17,500
What's up baby?

1245
01:02:17,500 --> 01:02:18,500
Yeah.

1246
01:02:18,500 --> 01:02:19,500
All right.

1247
01:02:19,500 --> 01:02:20,500
What's up?

1248
01:02:20,500 --> 01:02:23,140
Okay, maybe I didn't spare you guys.

1249
01:02:23,140 --> 01:02:24,140
These guys are pretty cool.

1250
01:02:24,140 --> 01:02:25,140
Yeah, what's up baby?

1251
01:02:25,140 --> 01:02:26,140
Watch this.

1252
01:02:26,140 --> 01:02:27,140
Hey baby!

1253
01:02:27,140 --> 01:02:28,140
Yeah, hey baby.

1254
01:02:28,140 --> 01:02:29,140
Baby!

1255
01:02:29,140 --> 01:02:30,140
Okay, what's up?

1256
01:02:30,140 --> 01:02:31,140
Okay, I'm going to try this.

1257
01:02:31,140 --> 01:02:34,140
Oh no, once you get this move.

1258
01:02:34,140 --> 01:02:36,900
- What's up? - Evolution of dance!

1259
01:02:36,900 --> 01:02:40,940
- I like the way your wives look, baby! - What's up, Daniel?

1260
01:02:40,940 --> 01:02:42,780
Let me get at them!

1261
01:02:42,780 --> 01:02:45,500
The old guy had said you guys need to die, but...

1262
01:02:45,500 --> 01:02:46,700
What's up, Daniel?

1263
01:02:46,700 --> 01:02:51,340
Maybe I'm wrong. This guy's got really cool moves and attitude.

1264
01:02:51,340 --> 01:02:57,740
- (laughing) - He just Superman'd that hoe.

1265
01:02:57,740 --> 01:02:59,100
Holy shit.

1266
01:02:59,100 --> 01:03:02,060
Daniel, check that out. Show your wives that, they're gonna fuck you.

1267
01:03:02,060 --> 01:03:03,060
Daniel Tiger.

1268
01:03:03,060 --> 01:03:03,800
He's a bit.

1269
01:03:03,800 --> 01:03:04,600
Oh my God.

1270
01:03:04,600 --> 01:03:05,600
Daniel Lyon.

1271
01:03:05,600 --> 01:03:06,940
Daniel Lyon.

1272
01:03:06,940 --> 01:03:07,940
Daniel Lyon, I think.

1273
01:03:07,940 --> 01:03:08,940
Lead singer of the

1274
01:03:08,940 --> 01:03:09,940
The Evil of Amn Themes song.

1275
01:03:09,940 --> 01:03:10,940
The Evil of Amn Themes song.

1276
01:03:10,940 --> 01:03:12,940
Oh, that's true.

1277
01:03:12,940 --> 01:03:15,400
So, convince me.

1278
01:03:15,400 --> 01:03:16,620
Why should I spare your friends?

1279
01:03:16,620 --> 01:03:18,240
I just showed you everything.

1280
01:03:18,240 --> 01:03:20,580
Oh gosh, why should I spare your friends?

1281
01:03:20,580 --> 01:03:21,860
I'm just like him.

1282
01:03:21,860 --> 01:03:22,360
Well, he's a little-

1283
01:03:22,360 --> 01:03:24,880
We're basically three of the same guy.

1284
01:03:24,880 --> 01:03:29,540
We have to go to Santa's kid and I have to give him Axe Dark Temptation.

1285
01:03:29,540 --> 01:03:30,660
No, don't tell him that.

1286
01:03:30,660 --> 01:03:31,460
This is the old-

1287
01:03:31,460 --> 01:03:36,160
Wait a minute. I give him a little I give him a smooch a spray on the

1288
01:03:36,160 --> 01:03:41,160
smell. This guy loves testers. He gets one of his lion wives to smell it and

1289
01:03:41,160 --> 01:03:45,380
she goes like that's pretty good. Women love that. Women love

1290
01:03:45,380 --> 01:03:50,360
make her smell me. He's made of chocolate.

1291
01:03:50,360 --> 01:03:54,540
I want her to smell me. No wait wait.

1292
01:03:54,540 --> 01:04:01,100
She cannot resist. She eats you. God fucking damn you dumb ass. Dumb piece

1293
01:04:01,100 --> 01:04:03,100
I had this in the bag.

1294
01:04:03,100 --> 01:04:05,100
He was literally carrying us for the first time ever.

1295
01:04:05,100 --> 01:04:07,100
And you jump in the bitch's mouth.

1296
01:04:07,100 --> 01:04:09,100
I'm playing my character.

1297
01:04:09,100 --> 01:04:11,100
Okay. So one of your friends is gone.

1298
01:04:11,100 --> 01:04:13,100
Now we get rid of this elf.

1299
01:04:13,100 --> 01:04:15,100
No, he's gonna be back.

1300
01:04:15,100 --> 01:04:17,100
What? How do you mean?

1301
01:04:17,100 --> 01:04:19,100
He always comes back whenever he gets in.

1302
01:04:19,100 --> 01:04:21,100
Your wife is dead.

1303
01:04:21,100 --> 01:04:23,100
I look at his wife and I say,

1304
01:04:23,100 --> 01:04:25,100
"You are not skinny. You shall throw up."

1305
01:04:25,100 --> 01:04:27,100
(growls)

1306
01:04:27,100 --> 01:04:29,100
Roll talking with advantage

1307
01:04:29,100 --> 01:04:31,020
with advantage 'cause you sound just like Daniel.

1308
01:04:31,020 --> 01:04:32,640
(ball bouncing)

1309
01:04:32,640 --> 01:04:34,180
Oh my God! Nat 20.

1310
01:04:34,180 --> 01:04:35,220
Nat 20.

1311
01:04:35,220 --> 01:04:38,140
All three, all five of his lion wives start vomiting.

1312
01:04:38,140 --> 01:04:39,500
(laughing)

1313
01:04:39,500 --> 01:04:40,860
That's his second nat 20,

1314
01:04:40,860 --> 01:04:43,660
and both times it has not rolled, but bounced, guys.

1315
01:04:43,660 --> 01:04:44,900
It's pretty impressive.

1316
01:04:44,900 --> 01:04:45,980
Something is up with you today.

1317
01:04:45,980 --> 01:04:47,620
Yeah, you come spilling out.

1318
01:04:47,620 --> 01:04:48,900
(sighing)

1319
01:04:48,900 --> 01:04:50,660
What's your wife like that, though?

1320
01:04:50,660 --> 01:04:55,780
I guess I do want my wives to be skinnier.

1321
01:04:55,780 --> 01:04:56,620
You make a good point.

1322
01:04:56,620 --> 01:04:57,660
And he's just an elf.

1323
01:04:57,660 --> 01:05:00,020
- If you can't eat elves, cause of Santa.

1324
01:05:00,020 --> 01:05:01,420
- Who's Santa?

1325
01:05:01,420 --> 01:05:02,260
- God.

1326
01:05:02,260 --> 01:05:03,220
- Nobody.

1327
01:05:03,220 --> 01:05:04,420
Actually we don't know yet.

1328
01:05:04,420 --> 01:05:05,740
- Actually we don't really know.

1329
01:05:05,740 --> 01:05:07,980
We saw a star on this guy.

1330
01:05:07,980 --> 01:05:08,820
We saw a star on this guy.

1331
01:05:08,820 --> 01:05:10,180
- We hate Santa.

1332
01:05:10,180 --> 01:05:11,020
- Wait a minute, can you make the-

1333
01:05:11,020 --> 01:05:12,980
- We like the old God, not the new.

1334
01:05:12,980 --> 01:05:13,820
- We like the old God, yeah.

1335
01:05:13,820 --> 01:05:16,500
- But the new one, there isn't even a new one.

1336
01:05:16,500 --> 01:05:17,440
- There is a new one.

1337
01:05:17,440 --> 01:05:18,460
We just call him God.

1338
01:05:18,460 --> 01:05:22,100
- You know what I like is sex.

1339
01:05:22,100 --> 01:05:23,380
What's up, Danielle?

1340
01:05:23,380 --> 01:05:24,220
- Okay.

1341
01:05:24,220 --> 01:05:25,460
- I like sex too.

1342
01:05:25,460 --> 01:05:26,300
- Okay.

1343
01:05:26,300 --> 01:05:28,300
stepping in between the two of them.

1344
01:05:28,300 --> 01:05:32,940
I'm hobbling over with my cane.

1345
01:05:32,940 --> 01:05:36,140
You know what? I was going to kill you guys, but you seem pretty cool.

1346
01:05:36,140 --> 01:05:38,620
You make my wife skinnier

1347
01:05:38,620 --> 01:05:42,540
with your meanness, so I don't take the heat.

1348
01:05:42,540 --> 01:05:44,420
It's a pretty good idea.

1349
01:05:44,420 --> 01:05:46,500
How about this? You come here every once in a while.

1350
01:05:46,500 --> 01:05:48,700
You tell my wives they're fat, so they get skinny.

1351
01:05:48,700 --> 01:05:49,860
All right. What's up?

1352
01:05:49,860 --> 01:05:54,380
OK, Borat. And then he yanks on the whale's uvula.

1353
01:05:55,980 --> 01:05:58,980
And all three of you shoot out of the whale's blowhole.

1354
01:05:58,980 --> 01:06:01,980
Huh. I wouldn't figure that's how that works.

1355
01:06:01,980 --> 01:06:03,980
Into the next part of the poem.

1356
01:06:03,980 --> 01:06:09,980
Woosh! The wise men did fly out the blowhole,

1357
01:06:09,980 --> 01:06:12,980
and thank goodness they did, for that was their goal.

1358
01:06:12,980 --> 01:06:16,980
They went 'cross the sea, while inside that beast...

1359
01:06:16,980 --> 01:06:19,980
How lucky is that? I thought we'd be feast!

1360
01:06:19,980 --> 01:06:20,980
I think you'll be on food.

1361
01:06:20,980 --> 01:06:22,980
I find that rude!

1362
01:06:22,980 --> 01:06:24,980
Settle down, fellas. Chill with the 'tude.

1363
01:06:24,980 --> 01:06:27,980
Dude, we're now at the mountain, there's more traveling to do.

1364
01:06:27,980 --> 01:06:29,300
(laughing)

1365
01:06:29,300 --> 01:06:31,940
- The weather was colder, the North Pole grew near,

1366
01:06:31,940 --> 01:06:34,780
shivering, freezing from tip top to rear.

1367
01:06:34,780 --> 01:06:36,860
In front was a mountain so high in the sky,

1368
01:06:36,860 --> 01:06:39,340
the thought did occur we wish we could fly.

1369
01:06:39,340 --> 01:06:41,860
But the Magi are wise, crafty and shrewd.

1370
01:06:41,860 --> 01:06:44,540
No matter the task, they'll sure make it through.

1371
01:06:44,540 --> 01:06:46,660
The newborn son of Santa is finally near,

1372
01:06:46,660 --> 01:06:49,900
and once they do reach him, Christmas be here.

1373
01:06:49,900 --> 01:06:50,740
And so you guys are at the--

1374
01:06:50,740 --> 01:06:52,540
- Could've said is.

1375
01:06:52,540 --> 01:06:54,540
- I was feeling piratey, I don't know.

1376
01:06:54,540 --> 01:06:56,540
So you guys reached the foot of the mountain.

1377
01:06:56,540 --> 01:06:57,540
Hmmmm.

1378
01:06:57,540 --> 01:07:00,540
So we're getting back to, I'm from the North Pole, but I'm back home.

1379
01:07:00,540 --> 01:07:02,540
I know why I'm climbing all that shit, bitch.

1380
01:07:02,540 --> 01:07:07,540
Well, I'm sure I have some kind of knowledge about how to traverse this kind of terrain.

1381
01:07:07,540 --> 01:07:08,540
I would say you do, yeah.

1382
01:07:08,540 --> 01:07:12,540
So, I'm going to start, well first you set some anchors.

1383
01:07:12,540 --> 01:07:14,540
Wait a minute, are those sluts behind the mountain?

1384
01:07:14,540 --> 01:07:17,540
There's tons of sluts all over the North Pole.

1385
01:07:17,540 --> 01:07:18,540
Sluts?

1386
01:07:18,540 --> 01:07:19,540
Yep, sluts all over the North Pole.

1387
01:07:19,540 --> 01:07:21,540
Can you play just like a Scooby Doo run sound?

1388
01:07:21,540 --> 01:07:23,540
Just like, do do do do do do do.

1389
01:07:23,540 --> 01:07:30,540
know

1390
01:07:30,540 --> 01:07:35,500
Batman transition sound. Yes, that kind of works. Well, we don't have that

1391
01:07:35,500 --> 01:07:39,080
either to do a scooby thing. I mean I can give you this. I can give you this

1392
01:07:39,080 --> 01:07:43,800
okay. Does that work? So that works fine. My eyes bulge out of my head and I

1393
01:07:43,800 --> 01:07:47,200
turn to you. I turn to you. I was like why don't they have slots be on the

1394
01:07:47,200 --> 01:07:48,420
mountain? Tens of slots

1395
01:07:55,900 --> 01:07:56,900
That works. That works.

1396
01:07:56,900 --> 01:08:01,400
Yes, I'm going to start throwing anchors into this mountain and we're going to

1397
01:08:01,400 --> 01:08:05,800
start climbing this bit. Yeah, roll survival, which oh shit, that's owl with

1398
01:08:05,800 --> 01:08:06,800
advantage. Owl.

1399
01:08:06,800 --> 01:08:09,700
You just rolled a d4.

1400
01:08:09,700 --> 01:08:11,700
Oh, you did. 18.

1401
01:08:11,700 --> 01:08:15,800
Okay, six. Okay. And would you get with advantage? Yeah, all of you guys, all

1402
01:08:15,800 --> 01:08:16,900
you guys go with advantage.

1403
01:08:16,900 --> 01:08:19,300
Oh,

1404
01:08:19,300 --> 01:08:25,800
23 on the edge. 23. Wow. 23. 30, 20, 18 and 23. You guys scale

1405
01:08:25,800 --> 01:08:28,860
all this mountain with fucking ease. This is not there. Sluts be on the

1406
01:08:28,860 --> 01:08:32,760
mountain and I ran like Scooby Doo. I had stuff. I had stuff. I'm over

1407
01:08:32,760 --> 01:08:37,500
clocking my body. I'm literally I'm literally erasing minutes off the end

1408
01:08:37,500 --> 01:08:40,700
of my life, which is you do the inception walk where they walk up

1409
01:08:40,700 --> 01:08:44,820
the street and up where it's right. You're remembering like a Normandy style

1410
01:08:44,820 --> 01:08:49,140
event. Like you had like a PTSD flashback. Then you run so fast. No

1411
01:08:49,140 --> 01:08:52,960
man. I'm thinking about sluts. I'm a horny old man. I think of I

1412
01:08:52,960 --> 01:08:56,760
legal honey. My holiness is rubbing off on these old man. Maybe you're thinking

1413
01:08:56,760 --> 01:09:01,160
about rubbing off on me. Oh, shit. He's dirty grandpa. Now I'm thinking of my

1414
01:09:01,160 --> 01:09:05,160
sisters, man. What the fuck? That's awesome.

1415
01:09:05,160 --> 01:09:10,160
In the candy kingdom, we're all brothers and sisters to

1416
01:09:10,160 --> 01:09:15,400
north to that's basically how it worked in the Bible for most of it. Yeah, it's

1417
01:09:15,400 --> 01:09:18,280
trick. Yeah, I love brothers.

1418
01:09:18,280 --> 01:09:20,320
Where you're from

1419
01:09:20,320 --> 01:09:21,520
- Pikachu, Pikachu!

1420
01:09:21,520 --> 01:09:22,360
- Oh yeah!

1421
01:09:22,360 --> 01:09:24,840
(laughing)

1422
01:09:24,840 --> 01:09:26,260
- Oh yeah, guess what's up?

1423
01:09:26,260 --> 01:09:29,040
(laughing)

1424
01:09:29,040 --> 01:09:30,480
- Wherever you're from.

1425
01:09:30,480 --> 01:09:31,400
- Which is where exactly?

1426
01:09:31,400 --> 01:09:33,240
What are the exact kind of boundaries?

1427
01:09:33,240 --> 01:09:34,080
- I am from--

1428
01:09:34,080 --> 01:09:35,640
- Longitude, longitude.

1429
01:09:35,640 --> 01:09:38,320
- I am from Chocoyellow's kingdom.

1430
01:09:38,320 --> 01:09:42,640
From the magic kingdom in Atlanta.

1431
01:09:42,640 --> 01:09:43,680
- You're from Atlanta?

1432
01:09:43,680 --> 01:09:44,520
- Atlanta.

1433
01:09:44,520 --> 01:09:45,640
- Oh, okay.

1434
01:09:45,640 --> 01:09:48,640
That actually makes a lot of things make sense here.

1435
01:09:48,640 --> 01:09:52,160
outfit is starting to click for me. It must be Sunday.

1436
01:09:52,160 --> 01:09:56,560
Yeah, right. I was gonna say. That was church. That was church, Pikachu.

1437
01:09:56,560 --> 01:10:01,800
Oh man. I like to hear- I'm just a white guy from Atlanta.

1438
01:10:01,800 --> 01:10:06,360
Yeah, and you're dressed up for church. You guys are white guys from Atlanta? I didn't say anything about race, man.

1439
01:10:06,360 --> 01:10:09,760
You fucking weirdo. Oh, I'm from Israel. Oh, I'm white. Shut up.

1440
01:10:09,760 --> 01:10:13,800
I may have stepped on some rakes. All

1441
01:10:13,800 --> 01:10:17,800
three of you roll perception with advantage for this amazing mountain scale.

1442
01:10:17,800 --> 01:10:20,800
You have amazing survival skills.

1443
01:10:20,800 --> 01:10:21,800
Perception is what?

1444
01:10:21,800 --> 01:10:22,800
Eighteen.

1445
01:10:22,800 --> 01:10:23,800
Twelve.

1446
01:10:23,800 --> 01:10:24,800
Sixteen.

1447
01:10:24,800 --> 01:10:25,800
Eighteen.

1448
01:10:25,800 --> 01:10:26,800
Okay.

1449
01:10:26,800 --> 01:10:27,800
You two.

1450
01:10:27,800 --> 01:10:28,800
Sorry.

1451
01:10:28,800 --> 01:10:30,800
You must be too focused on leading the way.

1452
01:10:30,800 --> 01:10:32,800
Thinking of my sisters getting so fucking horny.

1453
01:10:32,800 --> 01:10:33,800
You're thinking about fucking your sisters.

1454
01:10:33,800 --> 01:10:34,800
Drooling.

1455
01:10:34,800 --> 01:10:36,800
I'm melting the snow on the side of the mountain with my drool.

1456
01:10:36,800 --> 01:10:37,800
You two.

1457
01:10:37,800 --> 01:10:39,800
Am I, am I, did I'm okay?

1458
01:10:39,800 --> 01:10:44,800
You two, so what you two hear is a rumbling from up above and you see.

1459
01:10:44,800 --> 01:10:46,800
Is that you thinking about your sisters?

1460
01:10:46,800 --> 01:10:48,600
I think that might be my biggest sister.

1461
01:10:48,600 --> 01:10:50,600
Instead, it is Cain and Abel once again.

1462
01:10:50,600 --> 01:10:52,300
Oh, these fucking cliques.

1463
01:10:52,300 --> 01:10:56,300
But this time it's Cain and he's saying, "Avalanche!"

1464
01:10:56,300 --> 01:10:58,600
And he's hitting Cable up against a mountain.

1465
01:10:58,600 --> 01:10:59,800
Who's Cable?

1466
01:10:59,800 --> 01:11:00,800
- From X-Men. - That's you, man.

1467
01:11:00,800 --> 01:11:02,100
It's Wolverine's brother?

1468
01:11:02,100 --> 01:11:04,600
- No, he's Scott Summer's son. - I thought--

1469
01:11:04,600 --> 01:11:06,300
- I'm Caleb. - Oh.

1470
01:11:06,300 --> 01:11:08,800
- He's hitting Abel-- - I've known you for five years.

1471
01:11:08,800 --> 01:11:09,800
Six years, you--

1472
01:11:09,800 --> 01:11:11,300
His name's not Cable?

1473
01:11:11,300 --> 01:11:13,100
No, it's Caleb.

1474
01:11:13,100 --> 01:11:14,300
Calby?

1475
01:11:14,300 --> 01:11:17,800
bro, was your second guess. If you got the cable wrong,

1476
01:11:17,800 --> 01:11:24,640
I can't believe how irony poison I am to understand what Patrick just did. Yeah,

1477
01:11:24,640 --> 01:11:28,840
he literally just did a pose y'all and it was some kind of letterish

1478
01:11:28,840 --> 01:11:35,520
watch out guys. It's a candy lunch. It's a candy lunch of rocks. You to a

1479
01:11:35,520 --> 01:11:36,920
candy lunch made of ice

1480
01:11:36,920 --> 01:11:38,460
to

1481
01:11:38,460 --> 01:11:39,660
roll

1482
01:11:40,920 --> 01:11:45,160
deck saving throws with with advantage and I just fucking die. I guess I got a

1483
01:11:45,160 --> 01:11:49,560
20. That's ball. It was another bounce or save ball fucking dexterity with

1484
01:11:49,560 --> 01:11:53,000
advantage. You balance ball balance 12 man. Well, what'd you get advantage?

1485
01:11:53,000 --> 01:11:57,360
You said? Then I got a 24. I got a six. Both of them are six. That's adding

1486
01:11:57,360 --> 01:12:02,160
balance ball. Yeah. Oh, she is. Okay. I rolled a four twice.

1487
01:12:02,160 --> 01:12:10,320
Oh God. 12 damage for you to you take six. I got a 20. Yeah, but you still

1488
01:12:10,320 --> 01:12:16,640
stick half. That's fair. I'm at 12 HP. You guys. Okay, I'm gonna drink my help

1489
01:12:16,640 --> 01:12:20,200
potions that I bought that when nobody else seemed to buy anything for even

1490
01:12:20,200 --> 01:12:21,640
though I got a teddy bear, bitch.

1491
01:12:21,640 --> 01:12:27,560
You got a teddy bear. Okay, how much does it heal? 2D4+2. Okay, I'm gonna

1492
01:12:27,560 --> 01:12:31,760
just overhear. And as you're drinking the potions, you see Cain and Abel

1493
01:12:31,760 --> 01:12:36,360
scurry off once again, and in their place, a dark rumbling from above,

1494
01:12:36,360 --> 01:12:38,580
- Not an avalanche this time.

1495
01:12:38,580 --> 01:12:40,380
- It's the thing from Fantasia.

1496
01:12:40,380 --> 01:12:42,820
- You hear a familiar tune.

1497
01:12:42,820 --> 01:12:46,940
- You're a mean one, Mr. Grinch.

1498
01:12:46,940 --> 01:12:48,300
- What is up, Grinch?

1499
01:12:48,300 --> 01:12:49,140
What is up?

1500
01:12:49,140 --> 01:12:53,540
- It's the old god, the Dark Grinch.

1501
01:12:53,540 --> 01:12:55,020
- What is up, Dark Grinch?

1502
01:12:55,020 --> 01:12:57,580
- I'm going to take care of you once and for all.

1503
01:12:57,580 --> 01:12:59,340
There'll be no Christmas on my watch.

1504
01:12:59,340 --> 01:13:01,100
- Wait, I thought we were boys.

1505
01:13:01,100 --> 01:13:03,580
- No, I'm the old god.

1506
01:13:03,580 --> 01:13:05,060
- You're a piece of crap.

1507
01:13:05,060 --> 01:13:06,580
You're a piece of crap.

1508
01:13:06,580 --> 01:13:07,700
You're a piece of crap.

1509
01:13:07,700 --> 01:13:09,020
You're a piece of crap.

1510
01:13:09,020 --> 01:13:10,580
I wouldn't touch you with a ten-foot pole.

1511
01:13:10,580 --> 01:13:14,420
I would never touch you with my long, weird finger.

1512
01:13:14,420 --> 01:13:15,420
Y'all.

1513
01:13:15,420 --> 01:13:16,420
Well, the finger isn't that long and crap.

1514
01:13:16,420 --> 01:13:17,900
You can't touch me with that finger any day.

1515
01:13:17,900 --> 01:13:18,900
Green motherfucker.

1516
01:13:18,900 --> 01:13:19,900
I'm green.

1517
01:13:19,900 --> 01:13:20,900
You green bitch.

1518
01:13:20,900 --> 01:13:21,900
I'm green.

1519
01:13:21,900 --> 01:13:25,380
Yeah, you know, in the candy kingdom, we kill all the green candies.

1520
01:13:25,380 --> 01:13:26,380
Ooh, that's fucked up.

1521
01:13:26,380 --> 01:13:27,380
You kill the green M&M?

1522
01:13:27,380 --> 01:13:28,380
Anything green.

1523
01:13:28,380 --> 01:13:29,380
Don't you ever kill them again.

1524
01:13:29,380 --> 01:13:30,380
It's what we do.

1525
01:13:30,380 --> 01:13:31,380
We're racist.

1526
01:13:31,380 --> 01:13:32,380
This is a beautiful...

1527
01:13:32,380 --> 01:13:33,380
What?

1528
01:13:33,380 --> 01:13:44,380
racist. You guys roll initiative. It's time to final battle time to fight this

1529
01:13:44,380 --> 01:13:46,580
bitch against the old God, the Grinch,

1530
01:13:46,580 --> 01:13:49,500
sixteen, ten.

1531
01:13:49,500 --> 01:13:55,420
Oh, well, that's plus six. That's an eight.

1532
01:13:55,420 --> 01:13:57,060
Okay.

1533
01:13:57,060 --> 01:14:01,540
Grinch go first.

1534
01:14:01,540 --> 01:14:08,540
Grinch gonna use his Grinch powers. Grinch gonna Grinch. Grinch is gonna Grinch.

1535
01:14:08,540 --> 01:14:15,540
Grinch is gonna Grinch y'all. How many is your ACs? Mine is 15. 14. 14. Okay he beats all your ACs.

1536
01:14:15,540 --> 01:14:22,540
Well I'm gonna beat him up. He goes MWAH! HAHAHAHA! And he shoots out a Grinch ray from his hands.

1537
01:14:22,540 --> 01:14:26,540
I didn't come up with any. What the hell is a Grinch ray? It's like a green ray. It's a green ray you stink.

1538
01:14:26,540 --> 01:14:29,140
I think we have once in a while

1539
01:14:29,140 --> 01:14:36,400
With the sort of a thing because of the same name same name probably the same type of special problems

1540
01:14:36,400 --> 01:14:42,760
All right, and he does seven damage to all three of you. Well guys. I'm at 5 HP, okay

1541
01:14:42,760 --> 01:14:45,660
And now it is Harold's turn though

1542
01:14:45,660 --> 01:14:53,080
No, she is well. I think that I will do again my icicle attack go for it

1543
01:14:53,860 --> 01:14:56,960
Come on, please. I really need to get I'm really high number

1544
01:14:56,960 --> 01:15:04,800
15 that's oh yeah nice, and he needs to be a DC 10 for freezing

1545
01:15:04,800 --> 01:15:10,360
Oh, yeah, one d8 plus three. Where's the d8? Where did it go the blue one right? No? Yeah?

1546
01:15:10,360 --> 01:15:13,900
It's the one that's most triangle. That's a nine

1547
01:15:13,900 --> 01:15:15,780
Wow

1548
01:15:15,780 --> 01:15:17,780
some serious damage

1549
01:15:17,780 --> 01:15:19,780
And he does resist the freezing though.

1550
01:15:19,780 --> 01:15:20,780
Piece of shit.

1551
01:15:20,780 --> 01:15:22,780
You slice along his Grinch body.

1552
01:15:22,780 --> 01:15:24,780
"Ahh! My Grinch body!"

1553
01:15:24,780 --> 01:15:25,780
What color is his blood?

1554
01:15:25,780 --> 01:15:27,780
It's blue of course!

1555
01:15:27,780 --> 01:15:29,780
What the fuck?

1556
01:15:29,780 --> 01:15:30,780
What?

1557
01:15:30,780 --> 01:15:32,780
Why is it blue? The rest of you is green.

1558
01:15:32,780 --> 01:15:33,780
Green or like black?

1559
01:15:33,780 --> 01:15:35,780
It smells like fucking shit!

1560
01:15:35,780 --> 01:15:38,780
No, no it doesn't smell bad.

1561
01:15:38,780 --> 01:15:40,780
You should kill yourself.

1562
01:15:40,780 --> 01:15:41,780
No.

1563
01:15:41,780 --> 01:15:43,780
You should kill yourself because you smell fucking terrible.

1564
01:15:43,780 --> 01:15:45,780
That's the best idea I've heard all day.

1565
01:15:45,780 --> 01:15:50,100
like a fucking you smell like you smell like shit Grinch and you should kill

1566
01:15:50,100 --> 01:15:55,100
yourself. No one at school likes you. No one. I don't. I don't. They don't. You

1567
01:15:55,100 --> 01:15:58,020
should fucking kill yourself. I think you have to get to know me. I've knew

1568
01:15:58,020 --> 01:16:02,580
you said I'm not joking. Literally, it would make the world better if you

1569
01:16:02,580 --> 01:16:04,940
fucking killed yourself. You're eight years old and you have a beard.

1570
01:16:04,940 --> 01:16:14,100
Psychic. Come on, do it. Come on, jump off the mountain. Jump off the side of

1571
01:16:14,100 --> 01:16:19,160
at the mountain green bitch green mother. We call you guys green.

1572
01:16:19,160 --> 01:16:19,860
You all talk

1573
01:16:19,860 --> 01:16:22,700
my kingdom damn

1574
01:16:22,700 --> 01:16:31,660
net one mother fucker. It was a bouncer to I was so I have the resolve to live

1575
01:16:31,660 --> 01:16:38,940
more than ever. Fuck I won't let you bastard yourself. I will kill myself.

1576
01:16:38,940 --> 01:16:39,940
There will be no

1577
01:16:41,060 --> 01:16:44,500
Christmas. I don't even know what that is yet, but there will be none of it on

1578
01:16:44,500 --> 01:16:48,260
my watch. I do know I'm trying to stop it. I know that because I'm an old God. I

1579
01:16:48,260 --> 01:16:51,620
thought we don't need to hear all this bullshit. I was just by turn and I've

1580
01:16:51,620 --> 01:16:56,060
tripped myself up. It's not his turn. It is now M and M stern. Okay, should I try

1581
01:16:56,060 --> 01:16:59,740
to get eaten again? Guys, I think that you should you have any other abilities?

1582
01:16:59,740 --> 01:17:02,700
Yeah, I have plenty go out of order. I mean, I just have I just have attacks.

1583
01:17:02,700 --> 01:17:06,940
You should use the plenty then. Oh, I all I have is being eaten or attacked

1584
01:17:06,980 --> 01:17:11,060
to attack him. You know what I'll just straight up attack him, even though I

1585
01:17:11,060 --> 01:17:13,180
haven't hit a single attack this entire game.

1586
01:17:13,180 --> 01:17:15,980
Okay, that's an eighteen hit

1587
01:17:15,980 --> 01:17:22,820
that's seven damage. Nice. Yeah, you just run up to him. You start punch him in

1588
01:17:22,820 --> 01:17:28,280
the gut where he got sliced and get a blue blood on your white gloves. Whoa and

1589
01:17:28,280 --> 01:17:32,280
now it is like a blue and white tie dye Pikachu.

1590
01:17:32,280 --> 01:17:36,380
I choose you to go next to take your turn.

1591
01:17:36,380 --> 01:17:43,020
Man, it's all on the sheet. You're looking up at the sky.

1592
01:17:43,020 --> 01:17:44,180
I didn't get him to kill himself.

1593
01:17:44,180 --> 01:17:45,180
Your moves are on the sheet.

1594
01:17:45,180 --> 01:17:49,140
So maybe I should just shoot a lightning bolt at him. Or thunderbolt, sorry.

1595
01:17:49,140 --> 01:17:53,300
This is the thought process of many high school bullies.

1596
01:17:53,300 --> 01:17:56,500
So what I'm going to do is just shoot.

1597
01:17:56,500 --> 01:18:00,500
Maybe I should use my powers. He didn't seem bothered by my insults.

1598
01:18:00,500 --> 01:18:03,380
Up the mountain like that.

1599
01:18:03,380 --> 01:18:06,180
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. Make it hop. Make it hop.

1600
01:18:06,180 --> 01:18:08,420
Oh, fucker. I've hit too many good rolls.

1601
01:18:08,420 --> 01:18:09,620
Yeah, you spent them.

1602
01:18:09,620 --> 01:18:10,620
You spent them on some cool stuff, though.

1603
01:18:10,620 --> 01:18:11,620
Law of averages, man.

1604
01:18:11,620 --> 01:18:12,620
Pretty good rolls.

1605
01:18:12,620 --> 01:18:13,620
It's true.

1606
01:18:13,620 --> 01:18:14,620
Karmic Dice.

1607
01:18:14,620 --> 01:18:15,620
Karmic Dice turned on.

1608
01:18:15,620 --> 01:18:16,780
Karmic Dice is turned on for you.

1609
01:18:16,780 --> 01:18:21,580
Your lightning bolts hop over the mountains, and they go past the Grinch. It is his turn

1610
01:18:21,580 --> 01:18:24,100
again. And he's going to now...

1611
01:18:24,100 --> 01:18:26,500
He's going to attack me for telling me to kill him.

1612
01:18:26,500 --> 01:18:32,420
Oh, yeah, he is. He's going to stick his long finger out. Roll a Dexterity saving throw,

1613
01:18:32,420 --> 01:18:33,420
Pat.

1614
01:18:33,420 --> 01:18:34,420
These be a good bounce.

1615
01:18:34,420 --> 01:18:35,420
Oh, my Christ!

1616
01:18:35,420 --> 01:18:42,700
Christ you tainted your die man tainted that shit in that ronnie's tooth the critical one. Oh, you're reset wait. You're actually reset

1617
01:18:42,700 --> 01:18:50,940
Yeah, you're back to zero. Oh, yeah, anything could happen now your finger goes wraps around your throat you take I like this actually

1618
01:18:50,940 --> 01:18:56,420
This is what that I pay women to do take for damage and you're gonna be around

1619
01:18:56,420 --> 01:19:02,500
It's gonna be around your throat for a while. I pay women to do this to me. So now you are gay

1620
01:19:04,620 --> 01:19:09,820
Now you are gay. I'm not gay. Well then why are you strangling another man?

1621
01:19:09,820 --> 01:19:12,220
Why are you strangling another man who derives pleasure from it?

1622
01:19:12,220 --> 01:19:15,820
The Grinch is definitely gay. That's why he lives in a separate place.

1623
01:19:15,820 --> 01:19:20,220
Yeah. He's been cast out by the Whos. It's a homophobic story.

1624
01:19:20,220 --> 01:19:23,820
What do you mean by Greenies? It's an allegory. No, this is separate from my character.

1625
01:19:23,820 --> 01:19:27,420
This is something that Seuss baked in. He's fine with gay Grinches.

1626
01:19:27,420 --> 01:19:31,020
Everybody's gay in my world. In Candyland? Yeah.

1627
01:19:31,020 --> 01:19:32,340
Candyland's on the-- It's called Candyland.

1628
01:19:32,340 --> 01:19:33,540
That's why they killed the greenies.

1629
01:19:33,540 --> 01:19:34,740
Candy-ass land.

1630
01:19:34,740 --> 01:19:35,740
Yeah.

1631
01:19:35,740 --> 01:19:37,820
You're up, though, by the way, Candyman.

1632
01:19:37,820 --> 01:19:38,820
Okay.

1633
01:19:38,820 --> 01:19:40,500
Oh, no, you're not. I'm sorry. Elfman.

1634
01:19:40,500 --> 01:19:41,500
Okay.

1635
01:19:41,500 --> 01:19:46,740
My carol, so I sing a song, give someone 1d6 of what?

1636
01:19:46,740 --> 01:19:48,420
Of like, they can add to an ability roll.

1637
01:19:48,420 --> 01:19:49,420
It's like Bardic Inspiration.

1638
01:19:49,420 --> 01:19:50,820
Oh, okay. All right.

1639
01:19:50,820 --> 01:19:51,820
I didn't know if that was health.

1640
01:19:51,820 --> 01:19:52,820
Yeah.

1641
01:19:52,820 --> 01:19:55,180
Well, I'm going to barely use any of my abilities.

1642
01:19:55,180 --> 01:19:56,820
It's a bonus action, too, so you can use it.

1643
01:19:56,820 --> 01:19:57,820
It's like Bardic Inspiration.

1644
01:19:57,820 --> 01:19:59,140
You can just use it as a bonus action.

1645
01:19:59,140 --> 01:20:04,140
So I'm going to do my slick sick.

1646
01:20:04,140 --> 01:20:05,240
What does that say?

1647
01:20:05,240 --> 01:20:06,080
Slick stick.

1648
01:20:06,080 --> 01:20:07,860
Slid side.

1649
01:20:07,860 --> 01:20:08,700
Slide sickle.

1650
01:20:08,700 --> 01:20:10,200
Slide sickle.

1651
01:20:10,200 --> 01:20:12,980
I'm going to use my slide sickle and I'm going to,

1652
01:20:12,980 --> 01:20:15,660
we're all up on the cliff now, yes?

1653
01:20:15,660 --> 01:20:19,940
I'm going to basically do a border around the cliff's edge.

1654
01:20:19,940 --> 01:20:20,780
Nice.

1655
01:20:20,780 --> 01:20:22,100
So that anytime that he's anywhere,

1656
01:20:22,100 --> 01:20:24,260
if we could somehow get him to the edge of this thing,

1657
01:20:24,260 --> 01:20:25,380
he may slip and fall.

1658
01:20:25,380 --> 01:20:26,740
Where his house is, yeah.

1659
01:20:26,740 --> 01:20:28,140
Yeah, so I'm gonna slide,

1660
01:20:28,140 --> 01:20:33,140
What do I have? Thirty feet of trail. I'm going to put a icy border on that.

1661
01:20:33,140 --> 01:20:34,840
Now boost my strength.

1662
01:20:34,840 --> 01:20:36,640
And I'm going to do the same thing.

1663
01:20:36,640 --> 01:20:38,840
What's a carol you're going to sing?

1664
01:20:38,840 --> 01:20:42,440
That's a good one, man.

1665
01:20:42,440 --> 01:20:46,040
This is how we do it.

1666
01:20:46,040 --> 01:20:47,740
This is how we do it.

1667
01:20:47,740 --> 01:20:50,640
I sing that one.

1668
01:20:50,640 --> 01:20:54,540
It's Christmas time.

1669
01:20:54,540 --> 01:20:58,040
Stockings on the wall in Santa's truck.

1670
01:20:58,040 --> 01:21:03,280
He has a truck in the truck. Really? He has a you have one D six. You can spend

1671
01:21:03,280 --> 01:21:09,000
a car and it's going in my truck. No. All right. Cool. It is now your turn, Eminem.

1672
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:14,400
OK, you can try to push him or punch him into the ice or something to slip him,

1673
01:21:14,400 --> 01:21:17,480
slip off to slip off the. Yeah, I'm going to try and punch him into the ice

1674
01:21:17,480 --> 01:21:23,240
to slip all the way off. And I get to decide to add this after I roll it. Yeah.

1675
01:21:23,280 --> 01:21:28,780
Okay, okay, that's a thirteen. You're going to want to have yeah

1676
01:21:28,780 --> 01:21:36,880
fourteen. My inspiration. No, it's is that the only thing I could have rolled

1677
01:21:36,880 --> 01:21:41,600
that would yeah pretty much yeah. Oh, no, sorry.

1678
01:21:41,600 --> 01:21:45,920
We're going to my inspiration man. You're up Pikachu

1679
01:21:49,240 --> 01:21:50,580
Yeah, push him.

1680
01:21:50,580 --> 01:21:51,700
Push him over.

1681
01:21:51,700 --> 01:21:54,840
All right, then I'll do a quick attack in hopes that it's a push.

1682
01:21:54,840 --> 01:21:57,540
OK, I'll let you try it.

1683
01:21:57,540 --> 01:22:00,960
Fuck. So five.

1684
01:22:00,960 --> 01:22:03,680
Your quick attack misses.

1685
01:22:03,680 --> 01:22:05,800
It's getting the best of us.

1686
01:22:05,800 --> 01:22:08,560
The Grinch does another three damage to you.

1687
01:22:08,560 --> 01:22:09,520
I'm dead.

1688
01:22:09,520 --> 01:22:13,520
Oh, that was too much pleasure.

1689
01:22:13,520 --> 01:22:15,940
And he shoots his beam at the two of you.

1690
01:22:15,940 --> 01:22:18,060
Oh no, it's over.

1691
01:22:18,060 --> 01:22:20,220
Both of you guys roll d20.

1692
01:22:20,220 --> 01:22:23,460
Four nine.

1693
01:22:23,460 --> 01:22:25,140
I already assume it's balance ball.

1694
01:22:25,140 --> 01:22:26,340
Yeah, balance ball.

1695
01:22:26,340 --> 01:22:26,740
Nine.

1696
01:22:26,740 --> 01:22:27,180
Okay.

1697
01:22:27,180 --> 01:22:28,700
Oh, seven.

1698
01:22:28,700 --> 01:22:30,380
You both take nine damage.

1699
01:22:30,380 --> 01:22:30,740
I'm dead.

1700
01:22:30,740 --> 01:22:30,980
You both dead.

1701
01:22:30,980 --> 01:22:32,060
I'm still alive.

1702
01:22:32,060 --> 01:22:33,380
I'm hanging on with two HP.

1703
01:22:33,380 --> 01:22:35,940
Cam, I have an idea for you.

1704
01:22:35,940 --> 01:22:37,420
You have to pray to new God.

1705
01:22:37,420 --> 01:22:38,740
Listen, listen, listen, listen, listen.

1706
01:22:38,740 --> 01:22:39,580
Pray to Santa.

1707
01:22:39,580 --> 01:22:40,180
The son of Santa.

1708
01:22:40,180 --> 01:22:41,460
What do we know about the Grinch?

1709
01:22:41,460 --> 01:22:44,820
Gray, green, stink.

1710
01:22:44,820 --> 01:22:45,780
You're getting closer.

1711
01:22:45,780 --> 01:22:47,540
He loves Christmas at the end of the month.

1712
01:22:47,540 --> 01:22:51,060
He's in the movie. He hates Christmas at first, but then he loves it, but then he

1713
01:22:51,060 --> 01:22:54,820
loves it. Heart. Guess what? Guess what's our? Yes. Guess what is on my

1714
01:22:54,820 --> 01:23:00,540
body right now? A teddy bear, a toy. He has never, ever gotten a gift. Oh my

1715
01:23:00,540 --> 01:23:05,140
god, teddy bear and pleased for the love of God. Give the Grinch. Give the

1716
01:23:05,140 --> 01:23:09,500
Grinch a fucking gift. I'm going to do. I want to live man. Yeah. Well, is it my

1717
01:23:09,500 --> 01:23:13,300
turn? Yeah. Okay. I'll be the only person who's left. I'd pick up the teddy

1718
01:23:13,320 --> 01:23:19,960
teddy bear. What are you doing get away? I don't know what I'm doing, but it

1719
01:23:19,960 --> 01:23:21,160
feels right

1720
01:23:21,160 --> 01:23:26,360
and I give him the teddy bear. I really slowly handed to him.

1721
01:23:26,360 --> 01:23:29,980
Thank you.

1722
01:23:29,980 --> 01:23:33,280
What is this feeling?

1723
01:23:33,280 --> 01:23:35,540
It's falling over and

1724
01:23:35,540 --> 01:23:39,380
it's called gravity.

1725
01:23:42,080 --> 01:23:45,380
Oh, I'll get you blue women him

1726
01:23:45,380 --> 01:23:54,480
my mortal enemy. Well played my friend. Sorry your teddy bears gone yeah that's

1727
01:23:54,480 --> 01:23:58,460
okay. He revives both of you and you guys continue to climb over the mountain

1728
01:23:58,460 --> 01:23:59,640
to the next part

1729
01:23:59,640 --> 01:24:01,920
of the poem

1730
01:24:01,920 --> 01:24:09,700
exhausted beyond measure, battered and bruised. The magi's journey was no

1731
01:24:09,720 --> 01:24:24,720
It's Santa! It's Santa! We must meet them both days!

1732
01:24:24,720 --> 01:24:27,720
Slow down for a moment! This ain't a race!

1733
01:24:38,720 --> 01:24:43,520
I agree. Quieting down, he sees the Magi arrive, bearing their gifts for the

1734
01:24:43,520 --> 01:24:44,640
son of this guy.

1735
01:24:44,640 --> 01:24:46,200
Ho, ho, ho!

1736
01:24:46,200 --> 01:24:52,540
Who are you three who've come to see me and my son? I'd like to bow and

1737
01:24:52,540 --> 01:24:56,400
get on one knee. Yeah, I'm also reverently bowing. I'm doing like I'm

1738
01:24:56,400 --> 01:25:00,720
being knighted. And I would say, "My name is Harold, and I don't know what

1739
01:25:00,720 --> 01:25:05,800
you are." I pledge my life to you and your son as well.

1740
01:25:07,200 --> 01:25:11,800
I'm looking for hot slots. Is there something written I'm supposed to be

1741
01:25:11,800 --> 01:25:15,300
nope? We just had amazing lines that you would have thought were written.

1742
01:25:15,300 --> 01:25:19,560
You thought those are written. That's how good we just do that out. I'm

1743
01:25:19,560 --> 01:25:22,780
looking for hot slots of any kind. Also, they have a gift for you.

1744
01:25:22,780 --> 01:25:27,820
Oh, please give them give those gifts to my son. I have to make a different

1745
01:25:27,820 --> 01:25:31,800
my all my other old man voices. Hold on. Okay, give those gifts to my

1746
01:25:32,720 --> 01:25:38,080
please. Oh, we do that. What gifts do you bring for him? You guys go first. I

1747
01:25:38,080 --> 01:25:44,400
bring a massage pad that you can put on a chair. Oh wow, so that baby can be

1748
01:25:44,400 --> 01:25:51,440
massaged before he has hair. That's a my rhyme damn my rhyme do I twist the

1749
01:25:51,440 --> 01:25:52,480
ax thing and I'm just

1750
01:25:52,480 --> 01:25:56,240
because when I

1751
01:26:00,520 --> 01:26:04,480
and I brought in my pocket. I have some chocolates that I

1752
01:26:04,480 --> 01:26:05,920
oh

1753
01:26:05,920 --> 01:26:11,280
what and guys the chocolates have been in my pocket this whole time. Oh, the

1754
01:26:11,280 --> 01:26:14,800
what happens to what happens to chocolates when they stay in your pocket

1755
01:26:14,800 --> 01:26:15,600
chocolate.

1756
01:26:15,600 --> 01:26:23,080
No, this is useless. I throw it on the ground and I stomp on it and I say,

1757
01:26:23,080 --> 01:26:27,960
but what else could I give? What other gift could I give that could be

1758
01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:32,880
associated with this day for years and years to come. Why I'm just an ancient

1759
01:26:32,880 --> 01:26:40,140
old man. I barely have anything to offer except for well, I suppose my cane and

1760
01:26:40,140 --> 01:26:42,920
guys, you're can't hand him my red and white

1761
01:26:42,920 --> 01:26:49,160
cane from the candy kingdom. Oh my fucking God, and I give it put it right

1762
01:26:49,160 --> 01:26:50,800
in the baby's mouth. Well done,

1763
01:26:50,800 --> 01:26:57,600
and that was my plan all along. Well done and the baby, the son of Santa

1764
01:26:57,600 --> 01:26:59,600
who could it be?

1765
01:26:59,600 --> 01:27:01,600
*imitates baby crying*

1766
01:27:01,600 --> 01:27:03,600
I knew it!

1767
01:27:03,600 --> 01:27:05,600
Throw him off the fucking cliff.

1768
01:27:05,600 --> 01:27:11,600
I hold the baby's nose open so it's mouth is wide and I just spray Axe all up inside.

1769
01:27:11,600 --> 01:27:13,600
Before you do, before you do that,

1770
01:27:13,600 --> 01:27:15,600
I rhyme.

1771
01:27:15,600 --> 01:27:17,600
The gift so touched Santa and the son of Santa

1772
01:27:17,600 --> 01:27:21,600
that the baby suddenly snaps into being.

1773
01:27:21,600 --> 01:27:23,600
And he says, "What if we had a day called Christmas

1774
01:27:23,600 --> 01:27:25,600
where everyone received presents and not just me

1775
01:27:25,600 --> 01:27:28,280
And it could be today, the day I was born, and that this happens.

1776
01:27:28,280 --> 01:27:30,740
Maybe, Dad, you could hire the elves who make all these toys,

1777
01:27:30,740 --> 01:27:33,580
and they could stay up with us in the North Pole instead of wherever they are now.

1778
01:27:33,580 --> 01:27:36,320
You could keep two lists, a gnarly list and a nice list.

1779
01:27:36,320 --> 01:27:40,160
Kids on the nice list should get to have presents that you give them based on what they ask for.

1780
01:27:40,160 --> 01:27:44,460
However, if a child is not good, they should be on the gnarly list, and you should give them coal instead.

1781
01:27:44,460 --> 01:27:48,040
You'll have to fly to every child's house and give them their present through the chimney.

1782
01:27:48,040 --> 01:27:51,600
You'll go down the chimney and sneak into a room where they'll have a tree that they put inside.

1783
01:27:51,600 --> 01:27:55,460
You put the presents under there, wrap the gift in gift wrap,

1784
01:27:55,460 --> 01:27:58,860
but you should also tell people who want presents to leave out milk and cookies

1785
01:27:58,860 --> 01:28:02,060
that way you get to eat something to eat when you're doing all that traveling.

1786
01:28:02,060 --> 01:28:05,060
You should get magic reindeer to fly you across the entire world

1787
01:28:05,060 --> 01:28:09,360
and pull you by a sled that goes in the sky, carry all the toys in a sack that sits next to you.

1788
01:28:09,360 --> 01:28:11,660
One of the reindeer is going to have a glowing red nose

1789
01:28:11,660 --> 01:28:14,360
and he will help lead the way when it is nighttime because it'll be dark

1790
01:28:14,360 --> 01:28:15,960
and that's what we should do, I think.

1791
01:28:15,960 --> 01:28:18,660
I'm getting atheist vibes from that.

1792
01:28:18,660 --> 01:28:22,560
Yeah, when you lay Christmas out like that, it seems so asinine.

1793
01:28:22,560 --> 01:28:23,360
It really does.

1794
01:28:23,360 --> 01:28:24,860
It's not what the plan was.

1795
01:28:24,860 --> 01:28:28,220
you seem like an a the is not what I was. I'm not trying to do an epic

1796
01:28:28,220 --> 01:28:29,180
Christmas. What kind of

1797
01:28:29,180 --> 01:28:34,540
a frog fly around the world? No, he was just describing what Christmas should be

1798
01:28:34,540 --> 01:28:38,620
and Santa. Here's this wonderful idea and he's so excited. He says, Thank you

1799
01:28:38,620 --> 01:28:43,860
son, bye bye and he tosses the sun away and we don't know where he ends up or

1800
01:28:43,860 --> 01:28:48,140
where he goes. Sullivan the frog is canonically the son of Santa and his

1801
01:28:48,140 --> 01:28:51,100
birth is Christmas. What the hell and he's that old.

1802
01:28:52,100 --> 01:28:57,300
he's in all our future. Wait a minute. I have an idea. I will be on the sun.

1803
01:28:57,300 --> 01:29:02,020
Oh, come here. You pervert. I am Santa's

1804
01:29:02,020 --> 01:29:09,780
and the end of the story. And so that's a story of the first Christmas day.

1805
01:29:09,780 --> 01:29:14,380
The three Magi who traveled without delay. Merry Christmas to all and to all

1806
01:29:14,380 --> 01:29:17,940
a good night. Christmas is now a thing for all night.

1807
01:29:18,980 --> 01:29:23,180
Christmas is now a thing. Okay, for all night for all night for all night.

1808
01:29:23,180 --> 01:29:27,880
Well, my friend, you are truly a warrior of Christmas for this.

1809
01:29:27,880 --> 01:29:32,280
All right, thanks everybody. One of the most. This is better than that

1810
01:29:32,280 --> 01:29:36,280
fucking movie with the BB gun. What's the Oh Christmas story? The worst movie

1811
01:29:36,280 --> 01:29:39,580
of all time. Good night, my friends. Good night. Merry Christmas, everybody.

1812
01:29:39,580 --> 01:29:40,580
Miss Drew.

1813
01:29:40,580 --> 01:29:43,080
Can't see it.

1814
01:29:47,880 --> 01:29:51,380
This is also from a little one.

1815
01:29:51,380 --> 01:29:52,400
Oh, okay.

1816
01:29:52,400 --> 01:29:55,040
Yeah, how sweet is that?

1817
01:29:55,040 --> 01:29:58,040
It seems like we've taken a lot of these are a lot from kids.

1818
01:29:58,040 --> 01:30:00,800
Yeah, it's weird that we didn't get that many adults in our literature.

1819
01:30:00,800 --> 01:30:01,820
It's kind of weird, right?

1820
01:30:01,820 --> 01:30:03,200
Yeah, I feel like mostly kids.

1821
01:30:03,200 --> 01:30:04,420
I guess it makes sense.

1822
01:30:04,420 --> 01:30:08,480
This is from Little Ben.

1823
01:30:08,480 --> 01:30:09,500
Oh, okay.

1824
01:30:09,500 --> 01:30:12,320
Hello, Santa.

1825
01:30:12,320 --> 01:30:17,160
This year, the only thing I want for Christmas is world peace.

1826
01:30:17,180 --> 01:30:20,460
Oh my god, that's so cute.

1827
01:30:20,460 --> 01:30:23,500
War, disease, social disorder.

1828
01:30:23,500 --> 01:30:26,380
How could I sit here and wish for big red fire trucks

1829
01:30:26,380 --> 01:30:28,460
or super powered action figures

1830
01:30:28,460 --> 01:30:29,660
when some people are struggling

1831
01:30:29,660 --> 01:30:32,140
just to afford basic human needs?

1832
01:30:32,140 --> 01:30:33,740
What a smart little kid.

1833
01:30:33,740 --> 01:30:35,500
It would just be selfish.

1834
01:30:35,500 --> 01:30:37,780
And that's the problem with this world.

1835
01:30:37,780 --> 01:30:39,100
Selfishness.

1836
01:30:39,100 --> 01:30:42,180
Selfish corporate CEOs and money hungry politicians

1837
01:30:42,180 --> 01:30:44,100
hogging all the wealth up top

1838
01:30:44,100 --> 01:30:45,940
and leaving the little guy with nothing.

1839
01:30:45,940 --> 01:30:48,840
little bit all the way at the bottom. He's probably referring to himself or

1840
01:30:48,840 --> 01:30:51,260
his family as well. Is he related to Big Ben?

1841
01:30:51,260 --> 01:30:53,300
It could be a clock

1842
01:30:53,300 --> 01:30:58,140
all the way at the bottom. I just wish I could do something about it. You know

1843
01:30:58,140 --> 01:31:03,060
what, Santa? I finally decided what I want for Christmas. I want a voice.

1844
01:31:03,060 --> 01:31:10,860
I want a say in what direction the winds of change blow a say in the future that

1845
01:31:10,860 --> 01:31:35,180
I'm

1846
01:31:35,180 --> 01:31:39,620
Every border of this country will be protected by nuclear bombs and big red fire trucks.

1847
01:31:39,620 --> 01:31:44,340
To put an end to you illegally flying over the border, go back to your igloo, you disgusting

1848
01:31:44,340 --> 01:31:45,340
red snow pig.

1849
01:31:45,340 --> 01:31:46,340
Holy shit, Little Ben.

1850
01:31:46,340 --> 01:31:47,340
Little Ben, what the fuck?

1851
01:31:47,340 --> 01:31:48,340
I thought you were a little ass kid.

1852
01:31:48,340 --> 01:31:50,980
What a turn Little Ben has made.

1853
01:31:50,980 --> 01:31:53,620
I didn't know you were a grown man going by Little Ben.

1854
01:31:53,620 --> 01:31:56,220
I mean, his first name could be Little, I guess.

1855
01:31:56,220 --> 01:31:57,220
Little John.

1856
01:31:57,220 --> 01:31:58,220
Little John, yeah.

1857
01:31:58,220 --> 01:31:59,220
Little Richard.

1858
01:31:59,220 --> 01:32:00,220
Little Wayne.

1859
01:32:00,220 --> 01:32:01,220
Little Wayne.

1860
01:32:01,220 --> 01:32:03,420
Actually, there might be more Little Men than Little Hornets.

1861
01:32:03,420 --> 01:32:05,420
(Dog barks)
