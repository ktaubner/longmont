32
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:58,000

You can go there but it costs you $100 per minute you're down there.

46

67
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:06,800
just remember talking to this kid Owen one time and I was like I was trying to

68
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:11,000
like make friends with this kid and then he said like I was like oh yeah I was

69
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:15,300
playing Nintendo 64 at my home and he was like yeah well I was playing Nintendo 64

70
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:23,160
at my home he said I have a Nintendo 100 I was like damn it's literally just a

71
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:27,440
joke we do all the time yeah and then I just remember it specifically because

72
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:33,000
someone next to him turned to me and went you know he's lying damn I was I

73
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:37,360

00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:42,280
third grade like I'd gone to a new school and I told everybody that I yesterday

75
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:46,780
had gone skydiving. Damn. I was like eight years old. That's pretty cool. Like that's

76
00:03:46,780 --> 00:03:51,700
I think that's illegal. You can skydive as an eight-year-old. Yeah you can. Yeah you can.

Because I did it. You get strapped to your mom. Yeah. Yeah I do get strapped to your mom

79
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:07,120
she's got no bones. She's billowing. She has giant billowing folds of skin between their arm and

80
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:14,120
legs like a flying squirrel. She glides to the ground. No she doesn't. Yes she does. I do

81
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:19,160
that with your mom. She glides from tree to tree. Your mom's like a sugar glider. Yeah.

82
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:25,040
Your mom's... Because I call her sugar. What? That's what I call her. It's not reciprocated

83
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:31,520
though. Oh that's fine. Yeah. Because she actually calls me F-A-G-I-T. She calls me

84
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:36,840
F-A-G-I-T. But in a loving way. That you should be really jealous of. I don't care. I'm going

85
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:39,400
do the rest of the podcast like a ventriloquist while I drink this water.

86
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:43,640
Out of my collector's Ghostbusters cup.

00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:51,480
So this is better than not.

90
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:52,480
This is better than the TV.

91
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:53,480
It's better than the TV.

92
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:54,480
Yeah.

93
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:55,480
It is better than the TV.

00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:56,480
You drink tea?

95
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:57,480

Okay.

98
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:00,480
That's called a majority report.

99
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:01,480
Yeah.

100
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:02,480
Sam's Seder.

101
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:03,480
Sam's Seder.

102
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:04,480
Yeah.

103
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:05,480
Yeah.

104
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:06,480
That's what they do on majority report.

105
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:12,800
Have you guys seen Spitting Image?

106
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:13,800

I just watched all these videos last night.

108
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:20,080
They did the music video for Land of Illusion by Genesis.

109
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:21,160
That doesn't help me.

110
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:22,160
I don't even know.

111
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:23,480
I don't know what anything you just said is.

112
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:24,480
What?

113
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:25,480
Should I pull it up?

114
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:26,480
I know what an illusion is.

115
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:31,680
No, the video is like Ronald Reagan and they're like, the whole, it's the video is like the

116
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:36,300
Ronald Reagan puppet and he's like with his chimp and stuff and it's like Phil

117
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:40,760
Collins is telling Ronald Reagan that he needs to shape up or the world's gonna

118
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:46,080
end and it's all puppets. Music has never changed anything about the world. No.

119
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:49,720
It's true. No song that anybody ever wrote. What about Hurricane by Bob Dylan?

120
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:55,360
Hurricane caused Hurricane Katrina. Hurricane by Bob Dylan let Bob Dylan say

121
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:58,960
the N-word. True, that did change the world. Yeah. That was huge for white guys.

122
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:04,160
it's like Dylan had two periods there was when he went electric yeah and then when

123
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:08,200
he said the n-word when he went n-lectric he broke the color barrier

00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:36,960
actually ever heard him say it. How many white people have said the n-word in music? Zero.

129
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:44,880
Eminem got in trouble for it back in the day because he said it about a scorned lover.

130
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:51,420
Yeah, if I'm like some... Didn't, not white people. He'll be funny in the middle of Kim,

White musicians who said the n-word.

Oh, here's a list.

138
00:07:27,540 --> 00:07:30,540
How about you turn that brightness up?

139
00:07:30,540 --> 00:07:32,620
Because I don't want my computer to die while we're recording.

140
00:07:32,620 --> 00:07:33,620
Why don't you just plug it into the wall?

141
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:35,260
I'll just turn the brightness of my eyes up.

142
00:07:35,260 --> 00:07:39,500
Which white entertainers have a hood pass to say the n-word?

143
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:40,500
That's quite interesting.

144
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:41,500
Let's see here.

145
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:42,500
Krayoshan, I guess.

146
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:43,500
2012.

147
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:44,500
Oh, is that V...

148
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:46,500
Oh, because this was about the V-Nasty thing.

149
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:47,500
V-Nasty, yeah.

150
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:54,580
I remember this. Let's see here. Quentin Tarantino. What white people have the

151
00:07:54,580 --> 00:08:00,740
hood pass? It's just Andy Milonakis. Yeah and then also the picture of the

152
00:08:00,740 --> 00:08:09,100
author. I just want a list of John Mayer. Oh look at this list of white people who can say the n-word. Oh there I am in the middle.

153
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:13,780
Oh kind of weird, kind of weird how I've been allowed to say this. I'm gonna

154
00:08:13,780 --> 00:08:18,460
to accept it graciously but it's a little bit weird I just doing so much research

155
00:08:18,460 --> 00:08:23,560
on this John Mayer but he doesn't look like he said it John Mayer didn't say

156
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:26,940
the end said my dick is sort of like a white supremacist yeah I've got a

157
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:31,420
Benetton heart and a fucking David Duke cock yeah he said that he would never

158
00:08:31,420 --> 00:08:38,340
fuck a black lady whoa yeah Neil Brennan that we seek a new

159
00:08:38,340 --> 00:08:41,780
Neil Brennan was the guy who co-wrote The Chappelle Show.

160
00:08:41,780 --> 00:08:44,820
And he's one of those guys like Michael Rapaport, who's like,

161
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:50,100
they're white comedians, but they're like, "Yeah, black people fucking love me. I may be white,

162
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:54,420
but man, I'm really black." Like Chris D'Elia. It's the same thing.

163
00:08:54,420 --> 00:08:59,460

186
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:10,540
slur. I am not a racist. There is no way to defend the use of the word. It was all about

187
00:11:10,540 --> 00:11:16,620
intention." Jesus Christ. "It was used as a term of endearment toward my son who is white."

How about his son?

205
00:11:45,860 --> 00:11:49,180
Yeah, it was just like, "Sean and Hopper Penn are here," and then I looked him up and I

206
00:11:49,180 --> 00:11:53,380
was like, "Oh, he plays I Am Sam."

207
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:55,140

210
00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:01,300
of all things, having a hood pass.

- No, he made it and gave it to him.

229
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:33,660
Just like, "All right, roll."

Yeah.

255
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:07,120
Yeah.

256
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:08,120
If you got to be too funny.

257
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:09,120
And I come out, I walk out and I just go home.

258
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:10,120
[Laughter]

259
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:11,120

299
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:20,560

300
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:24,520
just like go into a black neighborhood and hire like a black dude to come out

301
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:30,120

303
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:38,160
crazy yeah yeah and Joe Rogan was like I need to get this man on this podcast

00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:45,040
every single episode yeah I need to have him on here and now here we are mm-hmm

305
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:52,640
here we are thanks for coming out Ari yeah yeah you are on the show now yeah

306
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:59,600
that was the joke I was making. I just remember Dom's dad almost got tickets to his show at the Wilbur for free and he was like

307
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:06,480
"Who the fuck is this guy?" Aaron's mom saw him at Fringe without knowing who he was and was very upset.

308
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:14,800
Yeah. Yeah, which makes sense. He was upset to be at Fringe? No, she was upset to see him perform. She's very anti-semitic.

309
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:22,240
yeah no she is Jewish so and she was very uh... She hates Ari Shafir's big Jewish nose

310
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:27,800
yeah yeah really bummed her out. Yeah you should call her the amazing racist yeah yeah she was mad

311
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:33,720
I just remember getting shown an amazing racist thing when I was a kid and I was like why would

312
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:39,520
that guy do that yeah what are you doing to the XLR cable? I'm just squeezing it. Stop.

313
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:42,720
That's it makes his voice go high. Yeah

314
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:46,320
Don't that's why the

315
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:52,120
That's probably why the other one kept breaking. No, it's not true because you're fucking jacking it off the whole time

316
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:57,580
I wasn't jacking it off. That's what you do to your penis is you just squeeze it like like with your heart rate

317
00:17:57,580 --> 00:18:02,760
Yeah, you squeeze a little bit. I have a good story, but it's kind of visual. Okay, there's this

318
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:04,520
kid

319
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:08,280
at my middle school who this is like I heard this story like through another

320
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:14,160
person so it's definitely just not true but um yeah he uh he apparently he

321
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:18,040
jacked off in the back of his like he was sitting you know there's like a

322

Mine looks exactly like the inside.

365
00:20:30,060 --> 00:20:32,380
I don't want to look at my penis.

366
00:20:32,380 --> 00:20:34,020

00:20:38,020 --> 00:20:39,020
It's completely clear.

371
00:20:39,020 --> 00:20:40,220
It has a molten core.

372
00:20:40,220 --> 00:20:42,860
It looks a little bit like a ladybug, but it's slimier.

373
00:20:42,860 --> 00:20:43,860
Here, this is like this one.

374
00:20:43,860 --> 00:20:45,100
The golden tortoise beetle.

375
00:20:45,100 --> 00:20:46,700

376
00:20:46,700 --> 00:20:47,780
That's what Patrick's penis looks like.

377
00:20:47,780 --> 00:20:49,780
Mine is speckled like a jawbreaker.

378
00:20:49,780 --> 00:20:51,660
And it's many layers.

379
00:20:51,660 --> 00:20:56,740
I was laughing though, just imagining just a guy getting kicked out of the mall for eating

380
00:20:56,740 --> 00:21:00,700
a jaw, like one of the big jaw breakers, too weird.

381
00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:02,820
You're being too weird about this, man.

382
00:21:02,820 --> 00:21:07,060
Just like, just a guy, just like sitting there just licking it, like it's sitting outside

383
00:21:07,060 --> 00:21:09,300
of like a Forever 21.

384
00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:10,300
This is what my penis looks like.

385
00:21:10,300 --> 00:21:11,300
Sir, what are you doing?

386
00:21:11,300 --> 00:21:12,300
Sir, you can't do that here anymore.

387
00:21:12,300 --> 00:21:15,700
I'm trying to lick a single tongue-sized hole into the middle of this jaw breaker.

388
00:21:15,700 --> 00:21:17,180
This is what my penis looks like.

389
00:21:17,180 --> 00:21:18,180
A tumbleweed?

390
00:21:18,180 --> 00:21:19,180
No, it's a...

391
00:21:19,180 --> 00:21:21,020
Yeah, because you can't see it through your massive pubes.

392
00:21:21,020 --> 00:21:24,140
You have too many pubes and they're all, they look like Bob Marley's hair.

393
00:21:24,140 --> 00:21:25,580
They're long and they're black tentacles.

394
00:21:25,580 --> 00:21:26,080
Yeah.

395
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:28,220
They're badass, dude.

396
00:21:28,220 --> 00:21:30,060
It's cool.

397
00:21:30,060 --> 00:21:31,820
This is just making me want to watch The Mummy.

398
00:21:31,820 --> 00:21:32,300
Yeah.

399
00:21:32,300 --> 00:21:33,420
These beetles.

400
00:21:33,420 --> 00:21:33,980
Yeah.

401
00:21:33,980 --> 00:21:35,660
Because they have the scarabs.

402
00:21:35,660 --> 00:21:37,260
Whoa, look at that thing.

403
00:21:37,260 --> 00:21:37,760
Ooh.

404
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:39,500
That's awesome.

405
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:40,380
I'm saving that to my desktop.

406
00:21:40,380 --> 00:21:44,700
You should upload just a screen recording of your computer during the episode because

407
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:47,580
there's a lot of stuff people can't see today.

408
00:21:47,580 --> 00:21:47,820
All right.

409
00:21:47,820 --> 00:21:50,220
We should become a visual podcast.

410
00:21:50,220 --> 00:21:53,260
We should become visual artists and start painting.

411
00:21:53,260 --> 00:21:54,220
Let's buy like a house.

412
00:21:54,220 --> 00:21:54,860
Let's buy an easel.

413
00:21:54,860 --> 00:21:55,980
And then get like a studio.

414
00:21:55,980 --> 00:22:00,940
Yeah and paint the walls outside with Trump equals dump just on every window.

415
00:22:00,940 --> 00:22:01,180
Yeah.

416
00:22:01,180 --> 00:22:03,500
Because like the ugliest house ever.

417
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:10,220
Every artist house like has like in the front lawn they have like just a bunch of signs that

418
00:22:10,220 --> 00:22:10,620
just say -

419
00:22:10,620 --> 00:22:11,420
Pete Buttigieg.

420
00:22:11,420 --> 00:22:11,660
Yeah.

421
00:22:11,660 --> 00:22:16,700
There's a bunch of like portraits of Pete Buttigieg like nailed over the windows.

422
00:22:18,060 --> 00:22:24,540
There's a poster down the street that's like a picture of like a bunch of SS guys, like Nazis

423
00:22:24,540 --> 00:22:25,900
and like -

424
00:22:25,900 --> 00:22:26,620
This is the one next to the seven?

425
00:22:26,620 --> 00:22:29,980
Yeah, it just says like, "If Trump is reelected, this could be the reality."

426
00:22:29,980 --> 00:22:35,660
Yeah, who the fuck - it's someone all around Austin just hangs up those posters.

427
00:22:35,660 --> 00:22:40,140
Can you imagine that guy in the public library just like photoshopping a bunch of Nazis together?

428
00:22:40,140 --> 00:22:42,540
And people would just walk by and then -

429
00:22:42,540 --> 00:22:47,980
There's a - at school in one of the bathrooms, there's a political cartoon on the end of it.

430
00:22:47,980 --> 00:22:53,900
inside of a stall. It's so funny. The Monopoly one? Yeah, it's literally just, it has a picture.

431
00:22:53,900 --> 00:22:57,500
It calls the school Emerson University. Yeah, it messes up the name of the school and then

432
00:22:57,500 --> 00:23:03,740
it's just a picture of a Monopoly board and it says like, it says like, like pass go,

435
00:23:16,300 --> 00:23:20,220
just like the names of the dorms. It's like this is a great political cartoon.

436

452
00:24:31,860 --> 00:24:34,380
dollars to get him out yeah we're gonna have to call your mom she's gonna have

453
00:24:34,380 --> 00:24:36,020
to give the vending machine a thousand bucks.

454
00:24:36,020 --> 00:24:36,860
- That would not happen.

455
00:24:36,860 --> 00:24:38,180
- I actually took a--

456
00:24:38,180 --> 00:24:40,380
- The vending machine would be too small for me to fit.

457
00:24:40,380 --> 00:24:42,620
- I took an HTML programming class over the summer

458
00:24:42,620 --> 00:24:44,100
and now I know how to do stuff like that.

459
00:24:44,100 --> 00:24:45,460
- You don't know how to use the vending machine.

460
00:24:45,460 --> 00:24:46,300
- No, I actually do.

461
00:24:46,300 --> 00:24:48,880
No, you can actually get anything that you want for free.

462
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:52,460
If you walk up, press zero, zero, zero, zero, zero, zero,

463
00:24:52,460 --> 00:24:54,660
zero, and then just select something, dude.

464
00:24:54,660 --> 00:24:55,500
You can get it for free.

465
00:24:55,500 --> 00:24:56,340
I'm serious.

466
00:24:56,340 --> 00:24:59,020
- You press the number, you press the price backwards

467
00:24:59,020 --> 00:25:01,160
of the item and it gives you two of it

468
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:02,420
and it shoots the money out.

469
00:25:02,420 --> 00:25:03,340
- Here's what you do.

470
00:25:03,340 --> 00:25:06,340
So you go out and get money out of the...

471
00:25:06,340 --> 00:25:10,340
And it comes out really fast, so you have to be careful.

472
00:25:10,340 --> 00:25:15,340
If you use like the T9 keyboard on the vending machine thing,

473
00:25:15,340 --> 00:25:18,340
if you type in jackpot all over the place...

474
00:25:18,340 --> 00:25:21,340
If you go to the back of the vending machine, there's actually a USB port.

475
00:25:21,340 --> 00:25:24,340
If you connect your computer, you can download the snacks.

476
00:25:24,340 --> 00:25:27,340
I'm serious. If you walk up to the keypad...

477
00:25:27,340 --> 00:25:30,340
I uploaded all those snacks, I downloaded them from the vending machine

478
00:25:30,340 --> 00:25:32,340
uploaded all of them on Pirate Bay.

479
00:25:32,340 --> 00:25:38,580
Oh dude. Snacks for all! If you go up to the pin pad on the vending machine and

480
00:25:38,580 --> 00:25:42,280
then you take out your phone and you dial 9-1-1 and then you call them and say

481
00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:45,820
yeah I'd like for you to come arrest these snacks they'll get them out for

482
00:25:45,820 --> 00:25:50,500

00:26:11,220 --> 00:26:14,220
I had to turn it in in person cause uh

489
00:26:14,220 --> 00:26:17,220
I had till the end of the month to pay it off. And I

490
00:26:17,220 --> 00:26:20,220
went down to the MBTA like police

491
00:26:20,220 --> 00:26:23,220
offices. I had to get a money order. Went down to the offices

492
00:26:23,220 --> 00:26:26,220

493
00:26:26,220 --> 00:26:31,100
vending machine I got a thing of peanut or pretzel M&Ms and then...

494
00:26:31,100 --> 00:26:35,220
You made your money back. Yeah I was sitting there waiting for the friggin the cop to come

495
00:26:35,220 --> 00:26:38,660
out like the the sergeant to come out and like get my money order and I like

496
00:26:38,660 --> 00:26:51,700
ordered peanut M&Ms or pretzel M&Ms and it wouldn't come out and I asked the cop to get my pretzel M&Ms out of the vending machine.

497
00:26:51,700 --> 00:26:56,260
cops have that power yeah he like was hitting that's part of it'd be funny if

498
00:26:56,260 --> 00:27:00,420
that was a part of a police officer's duty is like protect serve and also you

499
00:27:00,420 --> 00:27:06,900
deal with the vending machines no he was serving me yeah yeah and yeah and I was

500
00:27:06,900 --> 00:27:12,020
protecting my snacks from him because I don't want yeah yeah he was like he's

501
00:27:12,020 --> 00:27:16,660
like snack tax and he tried to take one of the M&Ms out I still do that I would

502
00:27:16,660 --> 00:27:21,620
grab his gun yeah yeah if that man if that cop touched my snacks I'm fast

503
00:27:21,620 --> 00:27:25,780
enough grab his gun and hit him yeah I'm fast enough I grab a gun I shoot his

504
00:27:25,780 --> 00:27:30,580
when you grab I shoot his hands so he drops the snacks and then I put my other

505
00:27:30,580 --> 00:27:33,740
hand down so I catch them before I hit the ground shoot a hole through his hand

506
00:27:33,740 --> 00:27:37,980
so anytime he tries to eat snacks and then I fuck it that honestly that's why

507
00:27:37,980 --> 00:27:43,940
that is a pain worse than death what imagine your hand fucked yeah every time

508
00:27:43,940 --> 00:27:52,340
Every time you pick up a candy piece to eat, it falls through your hand like a ghost.

509
00:27:52,340 --> 00:27:53,340
That's like Sisyphus.

510
00:27:53,340 --> 00:27:55,100
That's what ghosts are like.

511
00:27:55,100 --> 00:27:56,540
That's why ghosts are so angry.

512
00:27:56,540 --> 00:27:57,540
That's why they say "boo."

513
00:27:57,540 --> 00:27:58,980
I will never die if it means that I can't eat candy.

514
00:27:58,980 --> 00:28:01,340
They're booing because they're crying because they can't eat candy.

515
00:28:01,340 --> 00:28:02,860
They're saying "boo hoo."

516
00:28:02,860 --> 00:28:03,860
Where's my Skittles?

517
00:28:03,860 --> 00:28:04,860

00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:03,160
I do with my mouth because I would say well

537
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:09,260
I all I heard was candy and me know where candy goes and I'd pop it you pop that shit

542
00:29:29,220 --> 00:29:33,760

I got General Gao, it was very good.

571
00:30:44,180 --> 00:30:46,540
That's because you were respecting the military.

572
00:30:46,540 --> 00:30:47,540
That's true.

573
00:30:47,540 --> 00:30:48,540

Dung Poo does not sound like Kung Pao.

583
00:31:00,820 --> 00:31:01,820
That's why it's funny.

584
00:31:01,820 --> 00:31:03,300
You'd have to say Dung Pao.

585
00:31:03,300 --> 00:31:09,060
How about dung cow? That's better. No it's not. Dung pow chicken. You can't even say it.

695
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:12,480
what I tell it it has a woman's touch in it yeah come on that boosts the food at

701
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:49,040
Where's he going? His house. Man they walk so funny. It's so it's so crazy.

702
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:54,240
They still, we were talking about it earlier how they just look like a layer

703
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:59,480
before a cat dies. Yeah. And then Caleb said "finally I can see how a cat moves."

704
00:38:59,480 --> 00:39:03,480
I heard that from the bathroom. I started laughing in the bathroom.

705
00:39:03,480 --> 00:39:07,480
I've been thinking about like... all my whole life I've been thinking about

706
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:11,480
what is a cat doing under all that fur? And now I finally get to find out.

707
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:15,480
What if a cat took off its jacket? Yeah, what if a... wait, okay. What if a cat was naked?

708
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:19,480
Okay. I'm thinking about it.

709
00:39:19,480 --> 00:39:23,480
Yeah, I can't stop thinking about it. Why? You're not? I'm not, because I'm thinking about

710
00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:27,480
important things like money. Now, what if I told you it was a guy cat? Are you thinking about it now?

711
00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:30,720
thinking about it even less. He's thinking about it. I can see it. I can see it. I'm

712
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:34,360
thinking about if the guy cat was a girl cat. I can see through your eyes and both

713
00:39:34,360 --> 00:39:38,480
of the guy cats are turning into big t-bone steaks in your imagination. Yeah,

714
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:41,760
because I want to eat it. No, because you want to have sex with it. No, I want to eat it. You want to

715
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:45,360
eat a t-bone steak and then have sex with it. That's what happens to me. Yeah, that's a perfect night.

716
00:39:45,360 --> 00:39:53,360
When I walked down the street. The perfect Friday night is to eat a giant t-bone steak and then have sex with a boy cat.

717
00:39:53,360 --> 00:39:57,360
I meant the T-bone steak. You're fucking about the T-bone steak.

718
00:39:57,360 --> 00:39:59,360
You know that little circle part?

719
00:39:59,360 --> 00:40:01,360
I want to eat a big steak and then fuck your cat.

720
00:40:01,360 --> 00:40:06,360
The little circle part that they push out in the cartoons, you use that as a jack-off machine.

721
00:40:06,360 --> 00:40:07,360
Circle part?

722
00:40:07,360 --> 00:40:09,360
The circle bone of the steak.

723
00:40:09,360 --> 00:40:10,360
Oh yeah.

724
00:40:10,360 --> 00:40:12,360
You push it out and you fuck the meat in the middle.

725
00:40:12,360 --> 00:40:13,360
I push it out?

726
00:40:13,360 --> 00:40:14,360
Yeah.

727
00:40:14,360 --> 00:40:16,360
You fuck the bone's marrow-gina.

728
00:40:16,360 --> 00:40:21,360
I had a friend in high school who had two girl dogs, or he had one girl dog and one boy dog.

729
00:40:21,360 --> 00:40:24,200
his mom used to say puppy gina

730
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:30,960
Talking about like the dog. Yeah, my friend's dog said something was wrong with the dogs puppy

731
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:34,220
My friend used to call

732
00:40:34,220 --> 00:40:43,800
Puppy gina is really terrible. This lady used to call her dogs pussy, which also sucks but called it her coochie

733
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:46,080
Yeah, she's itching her coochie. I

734
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:48,080
I don't want to think about it.

735
00:40:48,080 --> 00:40:49,080
Just don't say it.

736
00:40:49,080 --> 00:40:50,080
Just don't talk about it.

737
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:54,000
You're literally ruining dogs' vaginas for me right now, lady.

738
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:55,000

762
00:41:52,520 --> 00:41:57,960
you watched all the time? Adventure Time probably. Yeah. When that first started coming out I was

763
00:41:57,960 --> 00:42:03,000
watching that religiously when it first uh when it first started airing because I guess I watched it

764
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:07,400
in like high school. I think it was middle school was it it was either middle school or high school

765
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:11,560
when it was coming when it for when did it start? It started in like middle school I never watched

766
00:42:11,560 --> 00:42:18,040
adventure time. I think I would probably still like it. The only thing I watched, I watched a lot of adult swim.

767
00:42:18,040 --> 00:42:22,520
Yeah, but I mean like kids cartoons, you know. I didn't watch a lot of kids cartoons.

768
00:42:22,520 --> 00:42:29,640
Yeah, I watched like the important ones. That's what I'm asking. I started 2010.

769
00:42:29,640 --> 00:42:36,200
I watched a lot of like real monsters and stuff. Yeah, like 90s stuff. Did you watch uh you watch Flapjack?

770
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:42,280
No. Flapjack was good. I didn't watch Flapjack. I didn't watch very much TV as a kid. I was just

771
00:42:42,280 --> 00:42:47,480
on the internet. I watched too much TV. I was addicted to TV. I was not. I wish I had been.

772
00:42:47,480 --> 00:42:53,240
It would have been better for me. I did. I watched TV while I was on the computer. Nice. That's a

773
00:42:53,240 --> 00:42:57,800
grown man. I was just on random forums and shit. I should have been watching real monsters. That

774
00:42:57,800 --> 00:43:05,240
would have been more fun. I remember I torrented a bunch of old like Nicktoons stuff when I was in

775
00:43:05,240 --> 00:43:11,840
middle school and I got like a oh do you remember Kablam? No. It was on like

778
00:43:19,800 --> 00:43:24,400
that thing was tight and you're like I wish I was an action figure mm-hmm I did

779
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:28,400

780
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:33,440
a rescue hero. No I don't. You always have giant pants and shoes on. I don't look like a...

781
00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:37,800

783
00:43:41,960 --> 00:43:46,240
Yeah but you're more like a Rescue Zero. No. Because of your zero brain IQ. If I was a

784
00:43:46,240 --> 00:43:52,600
Rescue Hero I'd be the one... Yeah you would be the one. You'd be the girl one? No. With the big boobies?

805
00:45:40,040 --> 00:45:47,400
just a woman with pink hair screaming at an elderly European couple and she was asking,

806
00:45:47,400 --> 00:45:50,680
clearly she was asking them for money, but she was sitting there screaming and she was

807
00:45:50,680 --> 00:45:56,640
like I want to fucking kill myself and she said something like now we got this

808

810
00:46:08,760 --> 00:46:12,720
guy with no shoes walked up to him and like pointed at the Burger King and he

811
00:46:12,720 --> 00:46:22,080
he's like "Burger King!" and the security guard just looked at him and shook his head.

812
00:46:22,080 --> 00:46:27,880
That's a really good interaction. Yeah. Yeah. I was glad I took my headphones out for that one.

813
00:46:27,880 --> 00:46:33,040
I saw, I had like a bullet time moment where he was walking towards the security guard and I

814
00:46:33,040 --> 00:46:37,880
was like "No shoes, this is a Burger King that has a security guard so stuff has

815
00:46:37,880 --> 00:46:41,400
happened in the past. I'm gonna take my headphones out." I love moments you

816
00:46:41,400 --> 00:46:44,340
can tell you have you're about to have to take your headphones out yeah there's

817
00:46:44,340 --> 00:46:49,620
this one crazy fucking bus driver who drives my bus yeah I see every once in a

818
00:46:49,620 --> 00:46:53,460
while he's a crazy and he just he's crazy he just like he won't pull up to

819
00:46:53,460 --> 00:46:57,180
the bus stop he'll like just stop in the street and go like go like come on come

820
00:46:57,180 --> 00:47:00,540
on and like like flail his hand and people like make like old people like

821
00:47:00,540 --> 00:47:04,580
walk into the street to get onto the bus he's like in a huge rush for no reason

822
00:47:04,580 --> 00:47:08,400
yeah he goes so fast that he has to pull over the bus and wait sometimes to like

823
00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:13,280
get back on schedule but he always just whenever at the end of the route at the

824
00:47:13,280 --> 00:47:16,600
end of line he always just makes a speech as we pull into the station it's a

825
00:47:16,600 --> 00:47:20,680
different one every day he's like today he was like the date today is January

826
00:47:20,680 --> 00:47:25,960
30th and everybody is waiting for you have a great day like what does that

827
00:47:25,960 --> 00:47:31,280
mean that's crazy one time he yelled because someone got on the bus this was

828
00:47:31,280 --> 00:47:36,520
like in the winter this was last year he somebody got on the bus wearing like axe

829
00:47:36,520 --> 00:47:41,120
body spray and he started freaking out and he's like "Who is putting on too much

830
00:47:41,120 --> 00:47:46,800
body spray? I have like I'm allergic to it it's gonna kill me!" and he opened up

831
00:47:46,800 --> 00:47:52,000
the this like skylight the like emergency escape on the top of the bus

832
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:55,360
and whenever the bus would stop at a red light he would open both of the doors

833
00:47:55,360 --> 00:47:58,600
he's like freezing fucking cold everyone's like shivering and he just

834
00:47:58,600 --> 00:48:02,200
kept like he was like waving his hand trying to air it out like you couldn't even

835
00:48:02,200 --> 00:48:03,040
- I can even smell it, it's crazy.

836
00:48:03,040 --> 00:48:03,880
- That is anti-guy prejudice.

837
00:48:03,880 --> 00:48:05,600
- He's just an insane guy.

838
00:48:05,600 --> 00:48:08,440
- That's, the thing is about being a bus driver

839
00:48:08,440 --> 00:48:11,520
is like, you can just do, like, nobody wants that job.

840
00:48:11,520 --> 00:48:12,440
You can just do that.

841
00:48:12,440 --> 00:48:14,160
You can just be whatever kinda.

842
00:48:14,160 --> 00:48:16,220
- There was a, when I lived in Revere,

843
00:48:16,220 --> 00:48:19,360
there was like a driver one day,

844
00:48:19,360 --> 00:48:21,540
I was waiting to go to class and I was already like,

845
00:48:21,540 --> 00:48:24,680
kinda late, and she like, pulled up to our stop,

846
00:48:24,680 --> 00:48:27,800
like not really, she like pulled up into this like,

847
00:48:27,800 --> 00:48:30,200
it's like this on-ramp to like route one.

848
00:48:30,200 --> 00:48:33,640
and she screamed at me and the other guy who were there.

849
00:48:33,640 --> 00:48:36,400
And she was like, "Come on, let's go!"

850
00:48:36,400 --> 00:48:40,000
And then she took us through the wrong neighborhood

851
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:42,600
and went through, like it was the 426 bus,

852
00:48:42,600 --> 00:48:44,760
but she was doing the 428s route.

853
00:48:44,760 --> 00:48:45,600
- Yeah.

854
00:48:45,600 --> 00:48:48,000
- And she was like going through like all this shit.

855
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:49,840
And then she just went to Haymarket

856
00:48:49,840 --> 00:48:51,760
and like didn't make us pay.

857
00:48:51,760 --> 00:48:52,600
So that was pretty good.

858
00:48:52,600 --> 00:48:53,800
- Yeah, that was not a bus driver.

859
00:48:53,800 --> 00:48:54,640
That was a random person.

860
00:48:54,640 --> 00:48:55,560
- That was a long car.

861
00:48:55,560 --> 00:48:56,800
- No, that was somebody.

862
00:48:56,800 --> 00:49:02,080
I one time was on a bus and this guy with a bunch of bags was sitting right next to the

863
00:49:02,080 --> 00:49:07,040
bus driver and he was like, "So if I wanted to become a bus driver, what would be the process

864
00:49:07,040 --> 00:49:08,040
for that?"

865
00:49:08,040 --> 00:49:10,760
And the guy was like, "Oh yeah, you just go online and you apply."

866
00:49:10,760 --> 00:49:12,320
And he was like, "Interesting, interesting."

867
00:49:12,320 --> 00:49:14,000
And then he didn't talk for ten minutes.

868
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:20,800
And he's like, "And if previously I had had four DUI convictions, would that affect my

869
00:49:20,800 --> 00:49:21,880
application?"

870
00:49:21,880 --> 00:49:24,120
And the bus driver was like, "I mean, probably.

871
00:49:24,120 --> 00:49:26,240
You might be fine."

872
00:49:26,240 --> 00:49:34,640
This is the kind of people who I am forced to say thank you to by the internet hive mind.

873
00:49:34,640 --> 00:49:36,840
I hate when they make me say thank you to the bus driver.

874
00:49:36,840 --> 00:49:39,360
They won't let you off the bus until you say thanks.

875
00:49:39,360 --> 00:49:40,360
Thank you.

876
00:49:40,360 --> 00:49:41,360
Shut up.

877
00:49:41,360 --> 00:49:43,800
I hate that your bus makes you pay to get off.

878
00:49:43,800 --> 00:49:48,340
One time I was getting off the bus and I tapped my card and it didn't take and I didn't notice

879
00:49:48,340 --> 00:49:52,160
and I got off the bus and the bus driver got off the bus and followed me and screamed at

880
00:49:52,160 --> 00:49:56,280
me and was like "Hey your fucking car didn't go through what the fuck is your

881
00:49:56,280 --> 00:49:59,600
problem?" I was like "Oh sorry man" I like went by tapped and I was like "I'm sorry I

882
00:49:59,600 --> 00:50:02,960
didn't notice" and he's like "Next time you better notice!" I was like "Okay"

883
00:50:02,960 --> 00:50:06,320
You imagine like getting off- no it's just a random- like another one I don't know I

884
00:50:06,320 --> 00:50:08,760
don't remember who- I don't get why they don't need to the bus drivers.

885
00:50:08,760 --> 00:50:12,160
Imagine like getting off the fucking bus to follow somebody. You should be able to pay their food.

886
00:50:12,160 --> 00:50:15,920
I feel like your route's crazy. My route definitely has a lot of crazy drivers.

887
00:50:15,920 --> 00:50:20,440
Well you're on one that has a string attached to it. Yeah. You're on a puppet bus. Yeah so

888
00:50:20,440 --> 00:50:23,320
all the bus drivers are puppets. Yeah, they're puppets and they're being

889
00:50:23,320 --> 00:50:27,760
controlled by it by the puppet master from Spy Kids 3 or the game master

890
00:50:27,760 --> 00:50:32,600
whatever. The game master. The game master from Spy Kids 3. He says I'm the game

891
00:50:32,600 --> 00:50:36,600

898
00:51:03,280 --> 00:51:07,440
movies that I remember is in the third one, when the grandpa gets up to run and

899
00:51:07,440 --> 00:51:12,000
he's like, "Junie! I can run!"

900
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:16,240
No, he says, he says, "I can stand!" And he's like, "Oh, grandpa, that's awesome!" He's

901
00:51:16,240 --> 00:51:22,560
like "Junie! I can run!" and then he runs away for like 30, he's like gone for like half the

902
00:51:22,560 --> 00:51:28,320
movie. He just leaves and then at the end he saves them. Yeah we have to watch that movie.

903
00:51:28,320 --> 00:51:33,360
But for like an hour the grandpa was just like "Oh I can run? I'm out of here bitch.

904
00:51:33,360 --> 00:51:39,680
They uploaded me to this game so that I could save the world but I can run!"

There should be a game where plants fight zombies.

00:53:40,160 --> 00:53:42,160
There should be.

957
00:53:42,160 --> 00:53:43,160
You know what I learned the other day?

958
00:53:43,160 --> 00:53:45,160
In the end you would think the zombies would win.

959
00:53:45,160 --> 00:53:46,160
Yeah.

960
00:53:46,160 --> 00:53:47,160
But it's crazy.

961
00:53:47,160 --> 00:53:48,160
You know what I learned the other day?

962
00:53:48,160 --> 00:53:51,640
Plants vs. Zombies was originally supposed to be called Lawn of the Dead and that's why

963
00:53:51,640 --> 00:53:54,600
it's plants and zombies but they couldn't get the copyright shit.

964
00:53:54,600 --> 00:53:57,120
So it just makes no sense.

965
00:53:57,120 --> 00:53:59,800
So it was all based on a pun and they just couldn't make the pun.

966
00:53:59,800 --> 00:54:00,800
That sucks.

967
00:54:00,800 --> 00:54:01,800
Yeah, it sucks dude.

968
00:54:01,800 --> 00:54:02,800
That would have been so much better.

969
00:54:02,800 --> 00:54:03,800
That would have been so mad.

970
00:54:03,800 --> 00:54:05,640
I probably would have played it if it was called Lawn of the Dead.

971
00:54:05,640 --> 00:54:10,600
I've played all those games a lot. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I love they weren't they phone games. They're originally

972
00:54:10,600 --> 00:54:19,800
Mac games, uh, yeah, they're like very simplified like tower defense around as advanced as a tower defense game on they're not as advanced as balloons three

973
00:54:19,800 --> 00:54:27,960
Calm, I remember balloons me. I would play balloons in class all of them. That's all it was like not working anymore

974
00:54:27,960 --> 00:54:34,200
Uh, you're not working anymore. What when since this summer? Oh, that's actually true

975
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:36,280

It's really beautiful.

1002
00:55:37,760 --> 00:55:39,520
We're probably going to do a couple different versions of it.

1003
00:55:39,520 --> 00:55:44,840
We'll do an acoustic one that's like, "It's been a long time."

1004
00:55:44,840 --> 00:55:47,440
We'll do a version with a cup song.

1005
00:55:47,440 --> 00:55:49,440
We'll do a "You're going to piss my poop pie."

1006
00:55:49,440 --> 00:55:52,920
We'll do a "You're going to piss my poop pie."

1007
00:55:52,920 --> 00:55:54,960
"You're going to piss my poopy pie."

1008
00:55:54,960 --> 00:55:57,000
"You're going to piss me by my poop."

1009
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:59,320
"You're going to piss me by my pie."

00:55:59,320 --> 00:56:01,320
You're gonna piss me by my poopy pie.

1011
00:56:01,320 --> 00:56:03,320

00:56:05,320 --> 00:56:07,320
My poopy poopy diapers.

1014
00:56:07,320 --> 00:56:09,320
Don't change my diaper.

1015
00:56:09,320 --> 00:56:11,320
My stinky poopy diaper.

1016
00:56:11,320 --> 00:56:13,320
I like the smell

1017
00:56:13,320 --> 00:56:15,320
when I'm playing games.

1018
00:56:15,320 --> 00:56:19,320
That's pretty good. I like to wear my diaper when I play games.

1019
00:56:19,320 --> 00:56:21,320
When I play. How many like, how many

1020
00:56:21,320 --> 00:56:23,320
Starcraft players

1021
00:56:23,320 --> 00:56:25,320
do you think

1022
00:56:25,320 --> 00:56:27,320
wore diapers? Wore the Asian diaper?

1023
00:56:27,320 --> 00:56:31,800
A hundred. A thousand. And two. I think that was the thing was like people at

1024
00:56:31,800 --> 00:56:37,200
Internet cafes in Korea were like wearing diapers so they could shit and piss while they play. Yeah. Yeah

1025
00:56:37,200 --> 00:56:41,360
They should just make the chair a toilet. Girls shouldn't be so weird about that. Yeah

1026
00:56:41,360 --> 00:56:43,880
you should be able to wear that and then beg for a

1027
00:56:43,880 --> 00:56:51,960
Blow job without taking a long-ass shower. It's true. I mean you should be able to do anything to your penis

1028
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:58,000
They should make they should make a the blumpkin for real. Yeah, they should make a stupid a

1029
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:02,820
Stupid girlfriend who will do whatever you say. They should admit that

1030
00:57:02,820 --> 00:57:10,160
Yeah, yeah, damn. He's got a cave. It's 530. We need to go. Yeah, you guys do all you know

1031
00:57:10,160 --> 00:57:15,720
How much time you go grab our spots for more three more minutes? Oh, we can do three three minutes. All right

1032
00:57:15,720 --> 00:57:19,980
Yeah, we could do three. Yeah, then do okay. Keep it with the Australian thing. I

1033
00:57:20,860 --> 00:57:26,380
Lost my family in the way. I lost my family in the fire. That's not funny. That's

1034
00:57:26,380 --> 00:57:31,940
Dude millions of people have died. Have you have you heard that?

1035
00:57:31,940 --> 00:57:37,180
Koalas have you heard there's a poison no and

1036
00:57:37,180 --> 00:57:42,540
They they are you poison and they sleep and they sleep and they all have chlamydia

1037
00:57:42,540 --> 00:57:45,540
if you

1038
00:57:45,540 --> 00:57:51,880
Heard of a person like that. I'm wondering why Darwin hasn't taken over. We should start writing crack calm articles like that

1039
00:57:51,880 --> 00:57:54,700
I gotta stop doing go grab the show

1040
00:57:54,700 --> 00:58:00,640
Crapped calm version. That's our version. Yeah, ten celebrities who said crap in a song

1041
00:58:00,640 --> 00:58:05,640
I actually wrote an article for cracked one time that got to the editing phase and then they were like

1042
00:58:05,640 --> 00:58:07,780
This is completely factually inaccurate

1043
00:58:07,780 --> 00:58:13,620
Yeah, but the general gist of the article was like was seven geniuses who were actually retarded

1044
00:58:14,420 --> 00:58:20,980
And they were like this is really good until I was like they were like so can you prove that Albert Einstein had?

1045
00:58:20,980 --> 00:58:23,100
Asperger's and I was like no, but

1046
00:58:23,100 --> 00:58:30,140
Like 15. Hey stuck his tongue out. Yeah, who does that? Yeah. Yes. He obviously can't pick up on social cues

1047
00:58:30,140 --> 00:58:32,140
Yeah, look at him. Yeah

1048
00:58:32,140 --> 00:58:34,820
And he's smart at math

1049
00:58:34,820 --> 00:58:38,100
Crazy hair crazy hair doesn't know how to comb. Yeah

1050
00:58:39,740 --> 00:58:40,740
I don't know, that's about all I know.

1051
00:58:40,740 --> 00:58:42,740
Does he sound like I'm making him talk?

1052
00:58:42,740 --> 00:58:43,740
No.

1053
00:58:43,740 --> 00:58:44,740
Kinda.

1054
00:58:44,740 --> 00:58:45,740
No, not at all.

1055
00:58:45,740 --> 00:58:46,740
You should take him and use him like a puppet.

1056
00:58:46,740 --> 00:58:47,740
Yeah.

1057
00:58:47,740 --> 00:58:48,740
I'm a puppet.

1058
00:58:48,740 --> 00:58:51,100
I love when puppets say I'm a puppet.

1059
00:58:51,100 --> 00:58:52,100
Yeah, that's one of the best.

1060
00:58:52,100 --> 00:58:55,180
It's one of those stock puppet jokes.

1061
00:58:55,180 --> 00:58:56,180
That's a...

1062
00:58:56,180 --> 00:58:57,700
I am the puppet.

1063
00:58:57,700 --> 00:58:59,060
I am the puppet.

1064
00:58:59,060 --> 00:59:00,060
Yeah.

1065
00:59:00,060 --> 00:59:01,060

Yeah, and then Peanut's like, I'm the puppet.

1069
00:59:05,540 --> 00:59:06,660
Peanut doesn't sound like that.

1070
00:59:06,660 --> 00:59:07,660
Peanut sounds like that.

1071
00:59:07,660 --> 00:59:08,660
No, Peanut's like, yo, yo.

1072
00:59:08,660 --> 00:59:09,660

01:00:07,140 --> 01:00:09,140
Bigfoot is a rat. Bigfoot's a giant rat.

1085
01:00:09,140 --> 01:00:11,140
What's the pimp character that Jeff Dunham has?

1086
01:00:11,140 --> 01:00:13,140
It's not Bubba J. Bubba J is the redneck.

1087
01:00:13,140 --> 01:00:15,140
Oh, yeah.

1088
01:00:15,140 --> 01:00:20,140
Why is, yeah, Jeff Dunham made that black puppet but then he made it look like a California raisin for no reason?

1089
01:00:20,140 --> 01:00:23,140
Well, the California raisins were black guys.

1090
01:00:23,140 --> 01:00:24,140
That's true.

1091
01:00:24,140 --> 01:00:26,140
Yeah. People just thought they were raisins.

1092
01:00:26,140 --> 01:00:28,140
