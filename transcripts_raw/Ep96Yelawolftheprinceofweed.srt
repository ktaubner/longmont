00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
You're listening to Israel's number one podcast.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,580
(upbeat music)

3
00:00:06,580 --> 00:00:11,120
- Crap monster.

4
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:11,940
(laughing)

5
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:12,780
(explosion)

6
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:13,620
- All right, recording two.

7
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:14,440
Let's try this again.

8
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:15,280
- All right.

9
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:16,120
- Yeah.

10
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:16,940
- One more time.

11
00:00:16,940 --> 00:00:17,780
- Yeah.

12
00:00:17,780 --> 00:00:18,620
- Happy 420.

13
00:00:18,620 --> 00:00:19,800
- Because Patrick is so high.

14
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:21,200
- I'm so stoned.

15
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:23,000
- He literally, he fucked up his audio

16
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,280
because he thought he saw--

17
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:27,180
- He tried to smoke his microphone.

18
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:30,160
Yeah, he thought he saw a chip.

19
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:32,260
He thought he saw a flaming hot Cheeto.

20
00:00:32,260 --> 00:00:33,100
Yeah.

21
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:34,960
And it was actually the end recording button.

22
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:36,460
But it, 'cause it was red.

23
00:00:36,460 --> 00:00:39,740
He saw the red, the record button,

24
00:00:39,740 --> 00:00:41,620
and he thought it was a--

25
00:00:41,620 --> 00:00:42,460
A Taki.

26
00:00:42,460 --> 00:00:43,780
A lengthways view of a Taki.

27
00:00:43,780 --> 00:00:45,860
Yeah, he thought it was a Taki flying towards him.

28
00:00:45,860 --> 00:00:46,700
And he tried to catch it with his--

29
00:00:46,700 --> 00:00:49,100
Yeah, he tried to eat it with his hands.

30
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:50,100
On the mouse.

31
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:50,940
Mm-hmm.

32
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:52,820
That's what happened.

33
00:00:52,820 --> 00:00:54,420
Yeah, and now he's--

34
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:56,300
I don't smoke anymore.

35
00:00:56,300 --> 00:00:57,740
Patrick's so high.

36
00:00:57,740 --> 00:00:58,580
Dude, I can see it in your eyes.

37
00:00:58,580 --> 00:00:59,420
- I used to. - No, I used to.

38
00:00:59,420 --> 00:01:00,520
- Why are your eyes so red?

39
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:02,460
- My eyes are red because of allergies.

40
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:03,860
- What, have you been crying?

41
00:01:03,860 --> 00:01:05,780
Have you been crying about how high you are?

42
00:01:05,780 --> 00:01:07,060
- Have you been crying, dude?

43
00:01:07,060 --> 00:01:09,140
You got so high that you started crying?

44
00:01:09,140 --> 00:01:10,180
- That's not true.

45
00:01:10,180 --> 00:01:11,820
- You did, man.

46
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:13,820
You got so high that you're crying now.

47
00:01:13,820 --> 00:01:15,340
That's why stoners have red eyes,

48
00:01:15,340 --> 00:01:17,260
because weed makes you so emotional.

49
00:01:17,260 --> 00:01:18,540
- Yeah. - Mm-hmm.

50
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:20,420
It makes you so emotional, you cry.

51
00:01:20,420 --> 00:01:22,940
- Yeah, they watch Seth Rogen and they laugh so hard

52
00:01:22,940 --> 00:01:24,660
that tears come out of their eyes.

53
00:01:24,660 --> 00:01:31,660
they want their own she's she's and she's she's she's she's she's she's she's she's

54
00:01:31,660 --> 00:01:38,660

55
00:01:38,660 --> 00:01:43,660

58
00:01:53,660 --> 00:01:55,960
I'm not smoking weed, I'm never smoking weed again.

59
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:57,300
- What happened to you?

60
00:01:57,300 --> 00:01:58,860
- I don't remember, but--

61
00:01:58,860 --> 00:01:59,700
- Whoa!

62
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:02,780
- There was the whole month of January pretty much,

63
00:02:02,780 --> 00:02:04,540
I was high every day.

64
00:02:04,540 --> 00:02:06,280
- That's what I'm talking about.

65
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:09,520
- And then I think February too,

66
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:13,780
I did lose the dab pen before New York, which sucked.

67
00:02:13,780 --> 00:02:14,620
That was the worst.

68
00:02:14,620 --> 00:02:16,380
- Yeah, that's probably good for you.

69
00:02:16,380 --> 00:02:18,860
- That was good for me, was not good for Dom.

70
00:02:18,860 --> 00:02:20,180
- Oh yeah, true.

71
00:02:20,180 --> 00:02:22,700
You can still have mine when this is over.

72
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:47,700
I'm

73
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:48,700
Yeah, the sequel to 420.

74
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:49,700
The day that you're listening.

75
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:50,700
Finally.

76
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:59,700
What's the most memorable time you guys ever toked?

77
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:01,700
You ever lit up a fatty?

78
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:05,700
The first time I smoked K2.

79
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:09,700
Yeah, I've accidentally smoked K2 quite a few times.

80
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:14,700
Yeah, that is definitely my worst weed memory is smoking not weed.

81
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:15,700
Yeah.

Fuck, I guess I have to kill my dog.

96

- Yeah.

97
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:09,900
- I played Pokemon Go a lot when it first came out

98
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:13,180
'cause I was in California and I was like 17 or whatever.

99
00:04:13,180 --> 00:04:15,920
- Yeah, no, I'm glad, I think,

100
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:17,920
I'm glad it came out when it did.

101
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:18,760
- Yeah.

102
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:19,940
- I'd be in like high school

103
00:04:19,940 --> 00:04:22,420
or like the very end of high school.

104
00:04:22,420 --> 00:04:24,980
It might've been the summer after high school for me.

105
00:04:24,980 --> 00:04:26,700
- I think it was something like that too.

106
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:28,160
I just remember I was like,

107
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:35,860
Me and my cousins were all drunk driving and piled into a car and played Pokemon Go in a

108
00:04:35,860 --> 00:04:39,300
place where the speed limit was like 15 miles an hour.

109
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:42,060
And we just stayed in the car and didn't talk to each other.

110
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:44,060
Just swiped our phones for two hours.

111
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:45,060
Nice.

112
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:49,740
For me, it was just perfect to be like, "Oh yeah, I'm going to play Pokemon Go with my

113
00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:53,020
friends and just walk around town and drink and smoke."

114
00:04:53,020 --> 00:04:54,020
Yeah man.

115
00:04:54,020 --> 00:04:55,020
Sick.

00:04:55,020 --> 00:04:56,020
It's a fucking party.

117
00:04:56,020 --> 00:04:57,780
None of my friends at the time played.

118
00:04:57,780 --> 00:04:58,780
That's the spirit of 420.

119
00:04:58,780 --> 00:04:59,780
Pokemon.

120
00:04:59,780 --> 00:05:01,620

Kind of interesting to think about. Yeah absolutely.

Psychokinesis.

165
00:06:54,640 --> 00:07:00,360

166
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:01,360
I thought I was Ness.

167
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:05,360

And uh...

173
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:23,120

174
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:27,080
yeah instead of all your clothes you have a joint for each item of clothing

175
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:27,600
uh huh

176
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:28,920

177
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:33,120

179
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:40,780

Yeah.

269
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:40,160
That's really good too.

270
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:43,800
Honestly, we are just doing what this list does say.

271
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:44,760
Oh yeah.

272
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:46,840
I think we're doing a better job.

273
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:47,680
I think we're doing a better job.

274
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:48,520
We are doing a better job.

275
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:49,840
I forgot what the list was.

276
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:52,720
Yeah, the list is top 10 TV shows

277
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:54,520
with one word replaced with weed.

278
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:56,760
So I feel like this is a good challenge.

279
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:59,400
From the user, Steven Universe is awesome.

280
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:02,480
So this is good because I think with all of these,

281
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:06,280
there's a better version of whatever it is.

282
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:08,360
- Yeah, so we can just workshop it.

283
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:10,480
- Yeah, so we can workshop it and make it better.

284
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:11,840
Like, okay, easy one.

285
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:13,960
- So do we say what the list was?

286
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:14,800
Top 10 TV shows?

287
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:15,620
- Yeah, we just said.

288
00:12:15,620 --> 00:12:17,240
- Yeah, so this is on the top 10s.

289
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:19,100
The number one is Buffy the Weed Slayer.

290
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:21,960
I feel like it's so easy to do Puffy the Weed Slayer.

291
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:23,640
- Puffy the Weed Smoker.

292
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:25,280
- Puffy the Weed Smoker.

293
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:28,080
But then you have a problem because you still have the,

294
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:29,200
and the is still normal.

295
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:32,180
So maybe weed, maybe Puffy weed smoker.

296
00:12:32,180 --> 00:12:33,600
(laughing)

297
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:35,600
Puffy THC weed smoker.

298
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:36,440

00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:37,840
Whoa, there we go.

300
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:39,760
That's good.

301
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:41,040
Yeah.

302
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:42,100
That is really good.

303
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:46,120
There's only one comment on this and it says,

304
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:47,560
"This is probably the worst list

305
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:49,240
"I've ever seen on this site."

306
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:50,320
Yeah, there's not a lot of comments,

307
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:52,040
but this one's about the comments.

308
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:56,480
Because they didn't have us to fix it.

309
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:58,680

310
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:00,920

376
00:16:47,380 --> 00:16:48,940
Story of the Weed.

377
00:16:48,940 --> 00:16:52,900

Yeah. That's true.

380
00:16:56,740 --> 00:16:59,700

382
00:17:01,860 --> 00:17:02,860

00:17:02,860 --> 00:17:07,580
Query from the weed.

384
00:17:07,580 --> 00:17:08,580
There's two comments.

385
00:17:08,580 --> 00:17:09,980
Somebody says weed in the house sounds better.

386
00:17:09,980 --> 00:17:10,980

00:17:10,980 --> 00:17:11,980
No it doesn't.

388
00:17:11,980 --> 00:17:14,900
I'm going to open this car door to get some fresh air.

389
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:15,900
Why because you're hot boxing?

390
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:16,900
It's really hot in here.

391
00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:18,340
Because he's hot boxing his car.

392
00:17:18,340 --> 00:17:21,020
If I was I would not open the door.

393
00:17:21,020 --> 00:17:22,300
Think about that for one second.

394
00:17:22,300 --> 00:17:24,820
Oh that's where Cory would have started.

395
00:17:24,820 --> 00:17:27,500
You open the door just so you can get the smoke to go out.

396
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:28,500
Smoking in the house.

397
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:29,900
What if it's Cory in the car?

398
00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:30,900
Smoking in the house.

399
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:37,740

00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:44,380
to

545
00:24:44,380 --> 00:25:02,100

546
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:05,100

547
00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:09,740

549
00:25:14,580 --> 00:25:17,980
yeah nature weed how about creature weed

550
00:25:17,980 --> 00:25:23,740
ok do not smoke creature weed do not that is one of the biggest mistakes you

551
00:25:23,740 --> 00:25:24,540
can make

552
00:25:24,540 --> 00:25:28,220
yeah you want nature weed not creature we do not want anything laced with creature

553
00:25:28,220 --> 00:25:30,980
or intended for a creature.

554
00:25:30,980 --> 00:25:33,980
Creature systems work the exact opposite of ours.

555
00:25:33,980 --> 00:25:37,940
So when you get hot, what makes creatures high,

556
00:25:37,940 --> 00:25:38,780
makes people die.

557
00:25:38,780 --> 00:25:40,300
- Does not make people high.

558
00:25:40,300 --> 00:25:41,900
- Yes, remember that rhyme.

559
00:25:41,900 --> 00:25:43,020
- I'm remembering that rhyme.

560
00:25:43,020 --> 00:25:45,500
- Makes creatures high, makes people die.

561
00:25:45,500 --> 00:25:46,660
- People die.

562
00:25:46,660 --> 00:25:47,500
- Yeah.

563
00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:48,320
- I'll never forget that.

564
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:52,360
- When you make cream pie, your girlfriend will die.

565
00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:54,660
Just remember that.

566
00:25:54,660 --> 00:25:57,380
Keep that in mind whenever you're smoking weed.

567
00:25:57,380 --> 00:26:00,460
When you go to your dealer and you want to make sure it's not creature weed, you ask them,

568
00:26:00,460 --> 00:26:03,540
"Hey, when I make cream pie, my girlfriend die?"

569
00:26:03,540 --> 00:26:04,500
Yeah.

570
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:07,100
Every creature is bi.

571
00:26:07,100 --> 00:26:10,260
And girlfriend only tell lie.

572
00:26:10,260 --> 00:26:15,380
If it rhymes, it's with the times.

573
00:26:15,380 --> 00:26:16,780
Yeah.

574
00:26:16,780 --> 00:26:17,640
It's facts.

575
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:19,260

these chips with my best friends

589
00:26:59,900 --> 00:27:03,740
there once was a man from nantucket

590
00:27:03,740 --> 00:27:08,940

591
00:27:08,940 --> 00:27:11,700
he got really high

592
00:27:11,700 --> 00:27:14,260
and then never could die

593
00:27:14,260 --> 00:27:16,160
and now he lives

594
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:20,540

I mean you may be thinking you do Caleb

00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:37,880
Smoking weed that means that I'm I'm freed. I went to the store to get some more weed. I

715
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:13,720
- Thank you. - Nice.

716
00:34:13,720 --> 00:34:15,680
- That's damn, that shit was dope.

717
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:18,200
- Yeah, it was dope, like the weed that I smoke,

718
00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:23,200
you know that I have to choke myself with the force.

719
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:26,480
When I smoke weed, I gain the force.

720
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:30,180
I love to read about different lores.

721
00:34:30,180 --> 00:34:38,960
I smoke weed and I read, and that's all I need is some weed.

722
00:34:40,720 --> 00:34:46,440
Thank you. Oh my god. That's for you for you busters. Yeah, it was pretty good.

723
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:53,540
Thank you. You should have said toke though. I love to toke. I love to croak like a

724
00:34:53,540 --> 00:34:59,420
toad. I'm on the road. I'm smoking weed on the road. I drive and smoke and that's my

725
00:34:59,420 --> 00:35:06,500
right. If you don't like it I will still light a big ol' blood in your face. So fuck you

726
00:35:06,500 --> 00:35:13,840

727
00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:23,360

730
00:35:37,380 --> 00:35:42,780
Smoke a lot of cheese. Smoke a lot of cheebug. That's a lot of cheese.

731
00:35:42,780 --> 00:35:51,060
Smokeable weed. Smokeable. Smoke a lot of cheeb. Smokeable weed. Smokeable weed.

732
00:35:51,060 --> 00:35:57,380
Yeah. I love when my weed is smokeable. Yeah. Number 37 is cosmic quantum weed.

733
00:35:57,380 --> 00:35:58,380
That's perfect.

734
00:35:58,380 --> 00:35:59,380
Yeah, that's good.

735
00:35:59,380 --> 00:36:00,380
I think that's good.

736
00:36:00,380 --> 00:36:03,860
But number 38 is just being weed.

737
00:36:03,860 --> 00:36:04,860
Smoking weed.

738
00:36:04,860 --> 00:36:06,860
No, being weed I think is pretty good.

739
00:36:06,860 --> 00:36:07,860
Yeah.

740
00:36:07,860 --> 00:36:14,020
Because I love smoking weed in the hopes that one day I will just, one day I will transform

741
00:36:14,020 --> 00:36:15,020
like the fly.

742
00:36:15,020 --> 00:36:16,020
Peeing weed.

743
00:36:16,020 --> 00:36:20,380
Because you smoke so much weed it comes out your damn urethra.

744
00:36:20,380 --> 00:36:27,300
Yeah, one time I applied for a job at Micro Center and like the day before I had smoked

745
00:36:27,300 --> 00:36:31,380
weed for the first time in like three years.

746
00:36:31,380 --> 00:36:34,500
And they were like, "Just so you know, we do comply" - this was in Boston - they were

747
00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:39,400
like, "Just so you know, we do comply with all federal regulations on drug testing.

748
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:43,860
So have you taken any drugs in the past three weeks?"

749
00:36:43,860 --> 00:36:46,300
And I was like, "No, not at all."

750
00:36:46,300 --> 00:36:51,620
And then I did the piss test and they just never - they tried calling me and I just never

751
00:36:51,620 --> 00:36:52,620
answered.

752
00:36:52,620 --> 00:36:53,620
I just gave up on it.

753
00:36:53,620 --> 00:36:55,900
I was just like, "I don't know why I took the piss.

754
00:36:55,900 --> 00:36:57,500
I should have just said yes.

755
00:36:57,500 --> 00:37:00,460
But I was so nervous, 'cause I needed a job so bad.

756
00:37:00,460 --> 00:37:01,300
But what if it failed?

757
00:37:01,300 --> 00:37:02,980
It was like the first week when I moved to Boston.

758
00:37:02,980 --> 00:37:06,880
It would have been a fail.

759
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:08,360
No, what if it passed?

760
00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:09,940
I mean, what if the test failed?

761
00:37:09,940 --> 00:37:12,620
Then I would still be working at Micro Center.

762
00:37:12,620 --> 00:37:15,660
I'd be building a weed computer right now.

763
00:37:15,660 --> 00:37:18,500
A super computer that could spit out new names for strains.

764
00:37:18,500 --> 00:37:20,900
420 gigahertz processor.

765
00:37:20,900 --> 00:37:23,780
Yeah, and you'd walk up, you'd press a button,

766
00:37:23,780 --> 00:37:25,980
And then it would go, donkey bong.

767
00:37:25,980 --> 00:37:28,240
(laughing)

768
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:32,580
That's the kind of stuff I would be doing.

769
00:37:32,580 --> 00:37:34,620
Donkey bong.

770
00:37:34,620 --> 00:37:37,100
New strain.

771
00:37:37,100 --> 00:37:37,940
- Yeah.

772
00:37:37,940 --> 00:37:40,700
Nephew's delight.

773
00:37:40,700 --> 00:37:41,540
- Nephew's delight.

774
00:37:41,540 --> 00:37:43,300
- Nephew's weed.

775
00:37:43,300 --> 00:37:45,020
- Nephew's weed.

776
00:37:45,020 --> 00:37:45,860
- Nephew's weed.

777
00:37:45,860 --> 00:37:46,740
- And I'd be doing that right now,

778
00:37:46,740 --> 00:37:49,580
and I'd still be working on that team at Micro Center,

779
00:37:49,580 --> 00:37:50,780
researching pot.

780
00:37:50,780 --> 00:37:52,740
That was a thing they would have,

781
00:37:52,740 --> 00:37:55,220
If I had passed, or if I had weed my system,

782
00:37:55,220 --> 00:37:58,420
it would have hired me to be the arbiter

783
00:37:58,420 --> 00:38:01,080
for the marijuana community at Micro Center.

784
00:38:01,080 --> 00:38:03,580
- They would have had to listen

785
00:38:03,580 --> 00:38:05,660
to whatever new strain ideas you had.

786
00:38:05,660 --> 00:38:06,500
- Exactly.

787
00:38:06,500 --> 00:38:08,860
- We should make a strain called Dead Dog Slime.

788
00:38:08,860 --> 00:38:09,680
And it makes you--

789
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:11,540
- We should make one called M&M Weed.

790
00:38:11,540 --> 00:38:14,340
- Like the candy?

791
00:38:14,340 --> 00:38:15,180
- Yeah.

792
00:38:15,180 --> 00:38:18,960
- How about M&Ms, what about M&Ms M&Ms?

793
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:21,260
- M&Ms smoking them.

794
00:38:21,260 --> 00:38:23,140
smoking smoking weed

795
00:38:23,140 --> 00:38:27,240
and he's getting high from cheap let's make it was a little patrick's the

796
00:38:27,240 --> 00:38:31,460
rapper let's make a strain of weed called heroin and just see what happens

797
00:38:31,460 --> 00:38:35,320
cf let's just do it the alice and i'm an ass smoking is

798
00:38:35,320 --> 00:38:39,740
they're gonna make a straight away lead a strain of weed called heroin and then

799
00:38:39,740 --> 00:38:42,540
whoever buys it there rest

800
00:38:42,540 --> 00:38:45,120
to think it's heroin

801
00:38:45,120 --> 00:38:46,740
they probably will do that

802
00:38:46,740 --> 00:38:48,940
yeah i'm so dumb

803
00:38:48,940 --> 00:38:51,360
there you can do a freestyle pat

804
00:38:51,360 --> 00:38:53,640
my mike is came on

805
00:38:53,640 --> 00:38:56,120
i hate you talking idiot

806
00:38:56,120 --> 00:38:59,680
you know i said i remind you that you don't know the and i'll just rethink it

807
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:03,120
and you know the after the court there's a couple times it came on for you

808
00:39:03,120 --> 00:39:04,280
kidding me

809
00:39:04,280 --> 00:39:07,780
now find out when it came unplugged i know i know i'm listening back to the

810
00:39:07,780 --> 00:39:11,720
episode i thought i know i know when i know when they got unplugged

811
00:39:11,720 --> 00:39:15,360
patrick got to know how is anything that you got high again i'm gonna put my

812
00:39:15,360 --> 00:39:21,440
I'm gonna put beeps in for when every time it got unplugged. No, you're gonna tell me the time stamps

813
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:27,340
Loud beeps, but he's gonna put like he's gonna blow smoke into the emergency system

814
00:39:27,340 --> 00:39:34,080
He's gonna make the waveform like a like a weed leaf. Yeah unplugged. That's what I'm gonna do

815
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:40,700
Yeah, if you blow smoke into the microphone the waveform will turn into a weed leaf. Yeah

816
00:39:41,160 --> 00:39:46,400
Yeah, we should hide we should hide a secret message to all of our stoners in the waveform of this episode

817
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:51,920
Mm-hmm, so we could hide like a giant pot leaf or like a friendly monkey

818
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:59,360
That's smoking weed the monkey that's mostly monkey. Yeah, if you don't hold your mic in your hand, it probably won't get unplugged

819
00:39:59,360 --> 00:40:01,960
Yeah, just put it down

820
00:40:01,960 --> 00:40:05,600
Yeah, but like I got a person I don't have like a desk

821
00:40:05,600 --> 00:40:10,740
I have like I'm gonna be hunched over a bunch subscribe to the patreon. Let's try and get Patrick a desk

822
00:40:10,740 --> 00:40:25,740
this

823
00:40:25,740 --> 00:40:27,740
I'm just gonna do this.

824
00:40:27,740 --> 00:40:28,740
Alright.

825
00:40:28,740 --> 00:40:31,140
I mean it's up to you.

826
00:40:31,140 --> 00:40:33,900
And then talk, and then talk into it like this.

827
00:40:33,900 --> 00:40:36,100
It looks like you're sucking your own small penis.

828
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:38,940
I can get out of the car and still have my butt.

829
00:40:38,940 --> 00:40:40,440
Are you gonna stand outside?

830
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:41,860
Do a man on the street bit.

831
00:40:41,860 --> 00:40:44,100
Yeah, go interview one of your neighbors.

832
00:40:44,100 --> 00:40:45,100
Go talk to your mom.

833
00:40:45,100 --> 00:40:46,100
Take a picture.

834
00:40:46,100 --> 00:40:48,260
I don't know how to do that.

835
00:40:48,260 --> 00:40:49,260
With your phone.

836
00:40:49,260 --> 00:40:50,260
Oh.

837
00:40:50,260 --> 00:40:53,340
My phone makes my microphone sound crazy.

838
00:40:53,340 --> 00:40:54,340
Patrick will do it.

839
00:40:54,340 --> 00:41:00,660
What are should we move on to the next list? Yeah, yeah, we added we had a double we had a double whammy

840
00:41:00,660 --> 00:41:07,240
Yeah, so we have as many as many episodes as the middle digit in 420 or as many lists as the middle digit 420

841
00:41:07,240 --> 00:41:12,680
Yeah, sorry many lessons. There are letters in THC if you minus the T. Yeah

842
00:41:12,680 --> 00:41:18,480
Which stands for hard to word hard hard core is how hard core getting high?

843
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:21,140
I am about weed it stands for freaking high

844
00:41:21,660 --> 00:41:23,020
- Hi, Cheba. - Hi, Caleb.

845
00:41:23,020 --> 00:41:23,860
- Hi, Caleb. - Yeah.

846
00:41:23,860 --> 00:41:24,700
- Hi, Cameron.

847
00:41:24,700 --> 00:41:25,960
- Not hi, Patrick.

848
00:41:25,960 --> 00:41:27,980
- No, never again. - It's 'cause Patrick

849
00:41:27,980 --> 00:41:29,500
can go down to the ground like a worm

850
00:41:29,500 --> 00:41:31,540
and he wriggles around and tries to find his way up

851
00:41:31,540 --> 00:41:32,820
people's pant legs.

852
00:41:32,820 --> 00:41:34,260
- Yeah, the early Patrick-- - And I don't condone

853
00:41:34,260 --> 00:41:35,260
that behavior. - That's not true.

854
00:41:35,260 --> 00:41:36,780
- The early Patrick catches his own balls.

855
00:41:36,780 --> 00:41:38,040
- That's not true.

856
00:41:38,040 --> 00:41:40,660
- Patrick has yet to evolve into a biped.

857
00:41:40,660 --> 00:41:41,500
- Yeah, Patrick is-- - I'm a biped.

858
00:41:41,500 --> 00:41:44,340
- Patrick has stuck in the water for 23 years.

859
00:41:44,340 --> 00:41:46,780
- You need to smoke some damn weed

860
00:41:46,780 --> 00:41:47,620
and evolve some legs-- - All right, I'm gonna

861
00:41:47,620 --> 00:41:50,100
smoke it right now. - To climb out of the puddle.

862
00:41:50,100 --> 00:41:50,940
- Oh, there he is.

863
00:41:50,940 --> 00:41:55,440
Dude, he's smoking weed out of the tip of his penis and he's lighting his balls on fire like a bong.

864
00:41:55,440 --> 00:41:59,180
Oh, yeah. I evolved into...

865
00:41:59,180 --> 00:42:00,860
Oh, he went meatwad mode.

866
00:42:00,860 --> 00:42:01,360
Yeah.

867
00:42:01,360 --> 00:42:03,600
Oh, man. I evolved from smoking.

868
00:42:03,600 --> 00:42:04,960
What?

869
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:05,860
What's that mean?

870
00:42:05,860 --> 00:42:07,460
I evolved from smoking.

871
00:42:07,460 --> 00:42:12,620
That's the thing. If somebody had given one of those fucking weird fish just a little hit of a blunt...

872
00:42:12,620 --> 00:42:13,860
I evolved from smoking.

873
00:42:13,860 --> 00:42:15,620
...we would all be meatwads right now.

874
00:42:15,620 --> 00:42:18,020
Dude, this list... I just went to this other list.

875
00:42:18,020 --> 00:42:21,380
the the intro paragraph i'm gonna have to just read this whole thing this is a

883
00:42:43,180 --> 00:42:47,140
naturally betches are perceptive is fuck however once we get high our thoughts

884
00:42:47,140 --> 00:42:51,020
become so complex and elaborate that we often confuse ourselves in what the fuck

885
00:42:51,020 --> 00:42:55,060
we were even thinking about. But regardless we honestly don't think it's

886
00:42:55,060 --> 00:42:59,260
a stretch to liken ourselves to Plato. The limit to topics as well as the

887
00:42:59,260 --> 00:43:06,100
enlightenment are truly boundless. What? Like Plato the food? No like...

888
00:43:06,100 --> 00:43:16,580
Well it said stretch. Yeah Plato is a food to Patrick. It tastes like salt.

889
00:43:16,580 --> 00:43:20,060
The limits of topics as well as the enlightenment are truly boundless, and by boundless we mean

890
00:43:20,060 --> 00:43:22,020
until our weed runs out.

891
00:43:22,020 --> 00:43:27,140
We introduce you to our next top ten list in our series of ongoing top ten lists, stoned

892
00:43:27,140 --> 00:43:28,140
topics of conversation.

893
00:43:28,140 --> 00:43:29,140
Oh, so this is a series.

894
00:43:29,140 --> 00:43:37,060
Yeah, I don't want to know any of the answers to any of these.

895
00:43:37,060 --> 00:43:38,460
I just want to discuss them.

896
00:43:38,460 --> 00:43:41,820
Yeah, like number ten, how do people discover drugs and alcohol?

897
00:43:41,820 --> 00:43:43,760
That's a great question.

898
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:48,280
i think they invented in a lab to make people does try to escape reality

899
00:43:48,280 --> 00:43:52,020
yeah i think that i think that it were all brains in a computer lab

900
00:43:52,020 --> 00:43:56,280
so we can't create this microcosm of the brain of it lab

901
00:43:56,280 --> 00:43:59,000
by creating a cool science lab inside the

902
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:01,080
simulation science lab

903
00:44:01,080 --> 00:44:04,600
so i think that the stuff that comes out of that science lab would make us escape

904
00:44:04,600 --> 00:44:09,220
to the upper level of the science lab i think that we was made in a also in a

905
00:44:09,220 --> 00:44:12,600
lab by an evil scientist named yakko

906
00:44:12,600 --> 00:44:16,400
And basically he saw an episode of Spongebob Squarepants and he was like,

907
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:18,780
"How do I make this shit as funny as hell?"

908
00:44:18,780 --> 00:44:19,780
[laughter]

909
00:44:19,780 --> 00:44:22,440
And so he designed an evil drug called weed.

910
00:44:22,440 --> 00:44:27,880
Yeah, I think, I think personally someone rolled a joint and said, "Hey, smoke this."

911
00:44:27,880 --> 00:44:31,620
Well, where'd they find the good stuff? That good good?

912
00:44:31,620 --> 00:44:33,760
It's a chicken or the egg situation.

913
00:44:33,760 --> 00:44:36,400
Yeah, what came first, the puffy bubble cush?

914
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:38,360
Or the smoky dab?

915
00:44:38,360 --> 00:44:39,620
Or the smoky dab rig?

916
00:44:39,620 --> 00:44:40,620
[laughter]

917
00:44:40,620 --> 00:44:42,360
Yeah, that's a great point.

918
00:44:42,360 --> 00:44:46,460
Yeah, what came first the the the the blunt or the ashes?

919
00:44:46,460 --> 00:44:50,660
What came first smoking or getting high

920
00:44:50,660 --> 00:44:53,200
That's wrong

921
00:44:53,200 --> 00:44:58,960
Smoking that's I think we're getting anyone. I think people were smoking things from the dawn of century

922
00:44:58,960 --> 00:45:03,760
Dude, no until like eight the 1800s you would just get high on the Sun. Yeah, it's true

923
00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:06,520
You just walk out and look at the Sun until you felt real weird

924
00:45:07,680 --> 00:45:14,340
They would and then your skin got red. Yeah. Yeah, that was one of the at-o's people who are allergic to getting high

925
00:45:14,340 --> 00:45:18,000
Those are like the pussies of the time people who got red skin. Yeah

926
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:21,640
You could get you could get high just from like riding a horse around

927
00:45:21,640 --> 00:45:30,120
It would shine yeah, yeah if you stood behind a horse and it kicked you in the head you get high as fuck

928
00:45:30,120 --> 00:45:35,220
Yeah, yeah, if you went to church you get really high people used to like

929
00:45:35,840 --> 00:45:38,560
They used to put a special powder in

930
00:45:38,560 --> 00:45:44,880
Bullets and people used to go into the middle of the town square and they would get each other high

931
00:45:44,880 --> 00:45:52,240
And you know boy times that's true. Yeah, shoot shoot. It would shoot edible THC bullets into each other

932
00:45:52,240 --> 00:45:54,840
Uh-huh, and then I knew what actually

933
00:45:54,840 --> 00:46:00,400
My god, so Christopher Columbus was trying to find the West Indies, right?

934
00:46:01,200 --> 00:46:05,960
He sailed the ocean blue and arrived in a little town called Jamaica, California

935
00:46:05,960 --> 00:46:09,400
Right. And what do you think the Indies?

936
00:46:09,400 --> 00:46:12,520
Got off the ship. They started waiting

937
00:46:12,520 --> 00:46:20,240
Exactly waving giant weed leaves on him like he was Caesar and they had palm leaves. There are huge weed leaves

938
00:46:20,240 --> 00:46:20,680
Yeah

939
00:46:20,680 --> 00:46:24,600
He worshipped him as a god and they let him puff that Chiba one time for the one time

940
00:46:24,600 --> 00:46:28,200
And then he had maybe one of the all-time weed freak

941
00:46:28,200 --> 00:46:38,560
out. Yeah. He had to freak out like Jack Sparrow did. Yeah he had a serious Jack Sparrow freak

942
00:46:38,560 --> 00:46:46,480
out. And he gave them. Yeah he spread the munchies to them on blankets. Yeah. Yeah the munchies

943
00:46:46,480 --> 00:46:55,280
wiped out the Native American race. Yeah. Sad. Yeah. Sad to think about but it's true.

944
00:46:55,280 --> 00:46:58,160
It also just gets you high just thinking about it.

945
00:46:58,160 --> 00:47:00,840
Also, even mental illness is getting me high.

946
00:47:00,840 --> 00:47:02,020
Sometimes I-- I have a contact high

947
00:47:02,020 --> 00:47:03,480
from Christopher Columbus.

948
00:47:03,480 --> 00:47:08,480
Sometimes I rotate like a old shitty forum PNG

949
00:47:08,480 --> 00:47:14,440
of a weed leaf in my head and that gets me high.

950
00:47:14,440 --> 00:47:15,280
You know what I mean?

951
00:47:15,280 --> 00:47:17,560
A little like 25 by 25.

952
00:47:17,560 --> 00:47:19,160
I got drunk as shit last night.

953
00:47:19,160 --> 00:47:21,080
I drank a bunch of margarita salt.

954
00:47:21,080 --> 00:47:23,080
Whoa.

955
00:47:23,080 --> 00:47:23,920
Yeah.

956
00:47:23,920 --> 00:47:24,760
That's crazy.

957
00:47:24,760 --> 00:47:25,760
How'd it go?

958
00:47:25,760 --> 00:47:26,760
I'm bloated.

959
00:47:26,760 --> 00:47:27,760
You're bloated?

960
00:47:27,760 --> 00:47:28,760
Yeah.

961
00:47:28,760 --> 00:47:29,760
You look good.

962
00:47:29,760 --> 00:47:30,760
You have a good Patrick look today.

963
00:47:30,760 --> 00:47:31,760
Yeah.

964
00:47:31,760 --> 00:47:32,760
I would describe this as "Klattstrick" Patrick.

965
00:47:32,760 --> 00:47:33,760
"Klattstrick"?

966
00:47:33,760 --> 00:47:34,760
Because you're looking like a Jadina Klattstrick.

967
00:47:34,760 --> 00:47:35,760
Yeah, you're straight down.

968
00:47:35,760 --> 00:47:36,760
You're like a Patrical piece of art.

969
00:47:36,760 --> 00:47:37,760
Yeah, I didn't go to bed like you guys told me to.

970
00:47:37,760 --> 00:47:38,760
I'm a Patrick, man.

971
00:47:38,760 --> 00:47:39,760
You can be me if you smoke a lot of weed.

972
00:47:39,760 --> 00:47:40,760
I'm a Patrick, man.

973
00:47:40,760 --> 00:47:41,760
I'm a Patrick, man.

974
00:47:41,760 --> 00:47:42,760
I'm a Patrick, man.

975
00:47:42,760 --> 00:47:43,760
I'm a Patrick, man.

976
00:47:43,760 --> 00:47:44,760
I'm a Patrick, man.

977
00:47:44,760 --> 00:47:45,760
I'm a Patrick, man.

978
00:47:45,760 --> 00:47:46,760
I'm a Patrick, man.

979
00:47:46,760 --> 00:47:50,760
Yeah, I didn't go to bed like you guys told me to.

980
00:47:50,760 --> 00:47:53,080
I'm a Patrick, man.

981
00:47:53,080 --> 00:47:55,400
You can be me if you smoke a lot of weed.

982
00:47:55,400 --> 00:47:57,160
I'm a Patrick, man.

983
00:47:57,160 --> 00:47:58,760
That's pretty good.

984
00:47:58,760 --> 00:47:59,760
Yeah.

985
00:47:59,760 --> 00:48:01,880
If it was about me, it would be a Vlasic, man.

986
00:48:01,880 --> 00:48:03,640
I'm a Vlasic, man.

987
00:48:03,640 --> 00:48:07,120
I love to eat those pickles.

988
00:48:07,120 --> 00:48:08,120
Those are the worst pickles.

989
00:48:08,120 --> 00:48:09,120
Yeah, they are.

990
00:48:09,120 --> 00:48:11,720
Yeah, I don't fuck with those pantry pickles.

991
00:48:11,720 --> 00:48:13,560
It's gotta be a refrigerated one.

992
00:48:13,560 --> 00:48:17,000
That Vlasic stork, let me tell you,

993
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:19,240
I'm gonna beat his ass.

994
00:48:19,240 --> 00:48:20,480
He's a pedophile, man.

995
00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:21,320
Yeah.

996
00:48:21,320 --> 00:48:22,880
So he has a baby in his mouth.

997
00:48:22,880 --> 00:48:24,880
He wants a baby's pickle in his mouth?

998
00:48:24,880 --> 00:48:26,200
Hell, excuse me?

999
00:48:26,200 --> 00:48:27,020
Yeah.

1000
00:48:27,020 --> 00:48:28,840
Pardon my French?

1001
00:48:28,840 --> 00:48:30,520
Pardon my take.

1002
00:48:30,520 --> 00:48:32,780
Yeah, PTI on that one,

1003
00:48:32,780 --> 00:48:34,680
because that's some fucked up S.

1004
00:48:34,680 --> 00:48:35,520
Uh-huh.

1005
00:48:35,520 --> 00:48:39,720
Number nine, reminiscing via backstalk.

1006
00:48:39,720 --> 00:48:40,540
I don't know what that means.

1007
00:48:40,540 --> 00:48:41,720
I don't know what backstalk means.

1008
00:48:41,720 --> 00:48:43,640
You guys don't have a back stock?

1009
00:48:43,640 --> 00:48:44,640
I think it's like a...

1010
00:48:44,640 --> 00:48:45,640
On your back?

1011
00:48:45,640 --> 00:48:46,640
You guys don't have...

1012
00:48:46,640 --> 00:48:47,640
It's like a...

1013
00:48:47,640 --> 00:48:49,680
It's a pole that you tie to your back.

1014
00:48:49,680 --> 00:48:50,680
No, it's...

1015
00:48:50,680 --> 00:48:51,680
It's a piece of wood.

1016
00:48:51,680 --> 00:48:53,440
You guys haven't been growing any?

1017
00:48:53,440 --> 00:48:54,440
Any stalks on your back?

1018
00:48:54,440 --> 00:48:55,440
No.

1019
00:48:55,440 --> 00:48:56,440
Can you grow weed on it?

1020
00:48:56,440 --> 00:48:57,440
I guess you guys aren't adults yet then.

1021
00:48:57,440 --> 00:48:58,440
No, I'm an adult.

1022
00:48:58,440 --> 00:48:59,440
It's kind of embarrassing.

1023
00:48:59,440 --> 00:49:02,120
You haven't gone through 70th puberty like me.

1024
00:49:02,120 --> 00:49:03,640
No, I'm an adult.

1025
00:49:03,640 --> 00:49:05,920
Cameron's back looks like a lotus pod.

1026
00:49:05,920 --> 00:49:08,200
It looks like a damn bamboo field.

1027
00:49:08,200 --> 00:49:10,220
There's pandas in there.

1028
00:49:10,220 --> 00:49:12,900
Cameron has a butt crack that goes up to his neck.

1029
00:49:12,900 --> 00:49:16,100
- Yep, and I reach in there and I fiddle around.

1030
00:49:16,100 --> 00:49:17,900
- No, you have to wipe all the way down.

1031
00:49:17,900 --> 00:49:19,940
- Yeah, that's why it takes me so long.

1032
00:49:19,940 --> 00:49:24,740
- The way Cameron poops is that he has to sit in a urinal,

1033
00:49:24,740 --> 00:49:26,460
like one of those stand up urinals.

1034
00:49:26,460 --> 00:49:29,060
- It comes from the top of his spine and it goes down.

1035
00:49:29,060 --> 00:49:31,540
- It goes all the way down, it goes up and down.

1036
00:49:31,540 --> 00:49:34,860
- He fits perfectly in one of those square urinals.

1037
00:49:34,860 --> 00:49:36,180
- Yeah.

1038
00:49:36,180 --> 00:49:38,400
- That's just how it was made.

1039
00:49:38,400 --> 00:49:39,300
- Yeah, it is.

1040
00:49:39,300 --> 00:49:42,540
He has all the ice that they put in the urinal.

1041
00:49:42,540 --> 00:49:45,020
That's for Cameron to sit on.

1042
00:49:45,020 --> 00:49:49,140
Yeah, to make sure his butt's too warm.

1043
00:49:49,140 --> 00:49:50,980
Yeah, it burns up.

1044
00:49:50,980 --> 00:49:51,820
'Cause it's got such a long crack.

1045
00:49:51,820 --> 00:49:54,380
I don't know what this means though.

1046
00:49:54,380 --> 00:49:57,020
I guess it just means that if you look

1047
00:49:57,020 --> 00:50:02,020
at your old Facebook stuff, you look seriously weird.

1048
00:50:02,020 --> 00:50:03,900
Yeah, and your high is crap.

1049
00:50:03,900 --> 00:50:04,740
Yeah.

1050
00:50:04,740 --> 00:50:06,140
I did that today.

1051
00:50:06,140 --> 00:50:08,300
I looked at all my old posts.

1052
00:50:08,300 --> 00:50:26,300
the

1053
00:50:26,300 --> 00:50:31,740
Everyone's gonna smoke weed at the same time and the smoke is gonna go up and cover the sun all the plants died

1062
00:51:07,140 --> 00:51:14,020
and they would. No it's not carbon monoxide in weed it's Cush-bin smoke oxide. Bin Laden.

1063
00:51:14,020 --> 00:51:23,160
Cush-bin Laden. I would say, yeah the way the world will end is that we're all, if everybody

1064
00:51:23,160 --> 00:51:27,520
in the world smokes weed at the same time will ascend simultaneously like

1087
00:52:33,720 --> 00:52:37,120
The RuneScape Manhattan is

1088
00:52:37,120 --> 00:52:40,840
It's a conspiracy that all

1089
00:52:43,280 --> 00:52:45,660
everything that happens on rune scape

1090
00:52:45,660 --> 00:52:48,640

1091
00:52:48,640 --> 00:52:50,900

00:55:57,880 --> 00:55:58,880
Whoa.

1154
00:55:58,880 --> 00:55:59,880
And you're just not getting paid.

I think it's time to unionize, buddy.

1156
00:56:01,880 --> 00:56:04,400
We're saying sag?

1157
00:56:04,400 --> 00:56:12,520
Yeah, there's a comment on there that says, by guest, it says, "So I'm not going to say

1158
00:56:12,520 --> 00:56:17,320
that I thought of literally every single one of these topics when I was stoned last night,

1159
00:56:17,320 --> 00:56:18,160
- What?

1160
00:56:18,160 --> 00:56:23,620
Something tells me they're lying

1161
00:56:23,620 --> 00:56:25,400
and they can't think about it.

1162
00:56:25,400 --> 00:56:27,480
- They're smoking conspiracy weed.

1163
00:56:27,480 --> 00:56:28,900
- Yeah, they're smoking, damn.

1164
00:56:28,900 --> 00:56:30,240
Can you imagine thinking about all 10

1165
00:56:30,240 --> 00:56:31,560
of those things in a row?

1166
00:56:31,560 --> 00:56:32,760
- At once?

1167
00:56:32,760 --> 00:56:34,520
- I would get too high.

1168
00:56:34,520 --> 00:56:35,360
- Yeah.

1169
00:56:35,360 --> 00:56:36,180
- If I thought about those.

1170
00:56:36,180 --> 00:56:38,280
- Someone says, "Bitches, you nailed it again."

1171
00:56:38,280 --> 00:56:39,700
WTF was I saying?

1172
00:56:39,700 --> 00:56:42,600
They got so high they forgot in the middle,

1173
00:56:42,600 --> 00:56:44,840
without even, they didn't even have three periods.

1174
00:56:44,840 --> 00:56:45,680
They just did a comma.

1175
00:56:45,680 --> 00:56:46,520
- This is good.

1176
00:56:46,520 --> 00:56:49,080
One guest says, "How do you bitches know my life?

1177
00:56:49,080 --> 00:56:50,680
Fuck, am I that obvi?

1178
00:56:50,680 --> 00:56:51,520
Who gives a fuck?

1179
00:56:51,520 --> 00:56:53,600
Pass me the Doritos with melted cheese.

1180
00:56:53,600 --> 00:56:55,840
Stealing bag, stoner's delight."

1181
00:56:55,840 --> 00:56:56,680
And then there was--

1182
00:56:56,680 --> 00:56:57,760
- Doritos with melted cheese?

1183
00:56:57,760 --> 00:56:59,940
- Yeah, and then the reply to that is,

1184
00:56:59,940 --> 00:57:01,240
"Doritos and cheese?

1185
00:57:01,240 --> 00:57:02,680
Get outta here, fatty."

1186
00:57:02,680 --> 00:57:04,940
(laughing)

1187
00:57:04,940 --> 00:57:09,080
Yeah, Doritos and cheese is insane.

1188
00:57:09,080 --> 00:57:11,600
- So funny, so true, so stoned.

1189
00:57:11,600 --> 00:57:14,720
LMFAO, maybe this article part of the conspiracy.

1190
00:57:14,720 --> 00:57:15,560
(laughing)

1191
00:57:15,560 --> 00:57:19,560
This is part of the conspiracy against me.

1192
00:57:19,560 --> 00:57:23,560
Yeah, my biggest, my favorite conspiracy is that Betches makes you smoke weed.

1193
00:57:23,560 --> 00:57:27,560
Betches gets you high from reading. Oh my god, dude, I have a message on Betches.

1195
00:57:30,560 --> 00:57:32,560
What's our message?

1196
00:57:32,560 --> 00:57:37,560
It says, "If you tell anybody, we'll fuck you."

1197
00:57:37,560 --> 00:57:39,560
Oh my god, dude.

1198
00:57:39,560 --> 00:57:42,560
Here's a comment that says, "I loved Tip of the Blunt.
