1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,580
(upbeat music)

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:10,080
- Why does he clap into your microphone?

3
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:10,920
I never understood that.

4
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:12,640
- Why does he clap into your microphone?

5
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:14,520
- Why does he clap into your microphone, man?

6
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:15,360
- What do you mean?

7
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:16,520
(laughing)

8
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:17,360
- So that the sound picks up.

9
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:19,100
- Why does he clap into your microphone?

10
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:21,740
- We all have microphones, he could do it in his own.

11
00:00:21,740 --> 00:00:23,320
- How is he gonna hold his microphone and clap?

12
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:24,760
- He's holding it like this.

13
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:25,600
(claps)

14
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:26,420
He could do that.

15
00:00:26,420 --> 00:00:27,320
- But the sound picks up better

16
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:28,480
from the front of the microphone.

17
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:29,320
- All right.

18
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:33,320
Also, do you maybe consider that maybe me and him just have a chemistry and a teamwork that we like to...

19
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:36,320
Yeah, it's a teamwork vibe. Teamwork makes the dream work, jerk.

20
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:37,320
I made that up.

21
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:39,320
I made up the last part.

22
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:40,320
That sounds beautiful as fuck.

23
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:42,320
Teamwork makes the dream work, weird jerk.

24
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:45,320
Damn, your rhyme is crazy.

25
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:50,320
They put 200 milligrams of caffeine into these...

26
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:53,320
The Dunkin' Ice Coffee Girl Scout Thin Mints?

27
00:00:53,320 --> 00:01:00,600
have it's like 225 yeah and I bought that because the the the bodega that we

28
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:09,880
always go to has fallen off they've lost the bodega the bodega the bodega yeah

29
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:15,720
the it also has 260 calories per bottle man shit you gotta watch out for that

30
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:23,280
man yeah oh I failed groggless January you did fail groggless January I was

31
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:27,600
like, "Oh, I'm like two weeks in," and then immediately failed.

32
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:33,400
How was, now that you're on the other end of it, grogless versus grogging? Which one is

33
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:34,400
better?

34
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:39,160
Well, I mean, I was grogless for six months, and the whole time all I wanted to do was drink

35
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:40,160
one beer.

36
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:41,160
But not this one grog.

37
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:42,160
Six months.

38
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:43,160
Yeah.

39
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:44,160
Well, this is two weeks.

40
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:45,840
Two weeks, no grog, trip report.

41
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:51,560
Trip report. Well, the first week, I only stopped drinking because I was on antibiotics for my

42
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:52,760
wisdom tooth infection.

43
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:54,760
Yeah, it's a good thing good and then

44
00:01:54,760 --> 00:02:00,880
The doctor said I would die

45
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:09,040
Poison and then I stopped for another week after that I was doing soda and bitters at the bar and then why

46
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:15,640
They give you that for free fuck that man. No, it's free. You know what? I like if I'm not drinking diet coke

47
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:17,680
Why am I getting a soda and bitters?

48
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:24,400
I'm at the bar. I'm not drinking. I'm just licking my lips in the inside of my mouth. Yeah, not

49
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:27,680
No, you're not I've seen you have a water see I got a hole now

50
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:31,640
I have a hole I've never got my wisdom tooth used to be and now I'm just doing this

51
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:36,440
That's nothing I'm putting my tongue in the hole oh

52
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:41,320
That was weird you look like a pirate you like the guy with no tongue for parts of the Caribbean

53
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:51,180
Stop it's my new style of speaking. You'll be a pretty good old mouth because you will in the next

54
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:54,180
I'm gonna look old dentures pretty yeah

55
00:02:54,180 --> 00:03:02,580
No, I mean I have taken I brush my teeth after drinking that I think I'm doing a teeth healing journey

56
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:05,820
I think that your teeth might even be that's the one part of me

57
00:03:05,820 --> 00:03:10,180
That's it might even be bad to brush them because you're like get your past the protective coat

58
00:03:10,180 --> 00:03:13,720
And you're getting you're just like scraping away all the good stuff my teeth

59
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:19,240
I actually that is what happened my teeth have right after Pat's teeth problems. I've been having teeth problems, too

60
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:25,820
Like cuz we were kissing. Yeah, it's just they hurt and it just goes into my it goes up into my brain. Yeah. Oh my

61
00:03:25,820 --> 00:03:33,880
That literally sounded like diarrhea

62
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:37,880
That sounded so fucking gross.

63
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:41,880
What? What?

64
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:45,880
It was in my mouth. It only was ever in the

65
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:49,880
can and then in my mouth. That is not gross.

66
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:53,880
That is not gross. That was pig energy? Yeah. You thought it was water?

67
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:57,880
I pour the

68
00:03:57,880 --> 00:04:01,880
I pour the bang in the coffee cup so that nobody

69
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:07,320
So people think I'm drinking coffee, but actually I'm drinking fucking bang energy.

70
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:09,560
Because I don't want anyone to know that I drink.

71
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:10,060
That's true.

72
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:12,060
Well yeah, that's the perfect...

73
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:14,060
I thought that was water!

74
00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:18,060
That's the perfect cup to pretend as though it was coffee.

75
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:20,060
What else could this be?

76
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:22,060
What are you drinking?

77
00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:24,060
Oh yeah, what do you think?

78
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:26,060
See, I want one of these cups where it says like,

79
00:04:26,060 --> 00:04:31,060
G-Fuel, Bang, Ghost Energy, Monster, White Monster.

80
00:04:31,060 --> 00:04:36,460
All that kind of stuff yeah, I'm gonna drink the rest and it has bubbles from my mouth, but I don't really care yucky

81
00:04:36,460 --> 00:04:41,500
You don't think that's yucky man. I think people in the military drink bang is that true. Yeah

82
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:47,220
I don't think I know it's not it's not the bang. That's gross here. It's you

83
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:51,360
Regurgitating it and I didn't ever I didn't regurgitate you

84
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:57,300
But you just brundle fly that never went you go. It never went down my you are a brundle fly

85
00:04:57,700 --> 00:05:04,560
Don't know what you're talking is that what is that Dungeons and Dragons? What is that from the don't tell him from the fly

86
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:06,760
God the movie fuck

87
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:10,400
But I thought sex shit. I thought that was a mild-mannered

88
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:17,540
Nebbish nerd yeah named Brundle mm-hmm. I'm gonna go God. He's gonna start going cheeseburger cheeseburger

89
00:05:17,540 --> 00:05:21,660
As we does in the movie says that in the movie. I've seen the movie in a minute

90
00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:26,060
I don't remember that line. He says like he says the Gina Davis. He's like two words

91
00:05:26,780 --> 00:05:30,620
cheeseburger. You know, I've been reading a lot about, or not reading, I've been

92
00:05:30,620 --> 00:05:35,020
listening to a lot of interesting stuff about ADHD and autism, and one of the

93
00:05:35,020 --> 00:05:40,580
biggest, one of the biggest like things that people use to diagnose ADHD and

94
00:05:40,580 --> 00:05:48,060
autism in adults is like hyper specific memory about movies and television. And I keep

95
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:53,060
hearing that and being like oh man, man, that's crazy.

96
00:05:53,060 --> 00:05:56,060
That's so crazy.

97
00:05:56,060 --> 00:05:57,460
Yeah, it's pretty interesting.

98
00:05:57,460 --> 00:05:59,260
Who's telling you all this stuff?

99
00:05:59,260 --> 00:06:00,460
Why are you reading them?

100
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:01,260
I'm not reading them.

101
00:06:01,260 --> 00:06:02,460
I'm listening to a--

102
00:06:02,460 --> 00:06:03,560
Yeah, why are you doing that?

103
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:06,060
I don't know, just fucking any four hour YouTube video,

104
00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:09,060
I'll just press play on it while I'm at the dog park.

105
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:09,760
You know?

106
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:11,960
Well, hey, to prove that theory more,

107
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:14,360
I've been doing that with the New Vegas lore.

108
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:15,860
Oh yeah, those are bad, dude.

109
00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:20,300
Once you run out of the good years of Opie and Anthony on YouTube,

110
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:24,340
and you just want something that is a low hum that you don't listen to at all.

111
00:06:24,340 --> 00:06:25,740
I was talking to you about this yesterday.

112
00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:32,900
I will listen to lectures because it's just a guy with a pretty decent voice talking for a little bit.

113
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:33,580
Yeah.

114
00:06:33,580 --> 00:06:38,300
I've been watching this one video. It was an hour of New Vegas.

115
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:40,660
It was like, "Here's some things that you might have missed."

116
00:06:40,660 --> 00:06:43,300
and the guy just keeps mispronouncing

117
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:47,240
like every like food that comes up.

118
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:48,540
- Men dots.

119
00:06:48,540 --> 00:06:51,140
- What I do, I watch six hour video,

120
00:06:51,140 --> 00:06:53,060
I watch like six hour like stream vods

121
00:06:53,060 --> 00:06:55,500
of people playing like Dark Souls or something,

122
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:57,460
which is a game that I'm not that good at.

123
00:06:57,460 --> 00:06:59,120
And I watch it and these are like people

124
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:00,500
who are like setting world records

125
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:01,660
for like beating every boss.

126
00:07:01,660 --> 00:07:04,100
And I watch it and I see them die and I go,

127
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:04,940
fucking idiot.

128
00:07:04,940 --> 00:07:05,780
- That guy sucks.

129
00:07:05,780 --> 00:07:07,540
- I'm gonna watch a different guy.

130
00:07:07,540 --> 00:07:08,820
- Yeah.

131
00:07:08,820 --> 00:07:12,940
I turn on one video and I see him die halfway through and I'm like, "God fuck, I'm never

132
00:07:12,940 --> 00:07:13,940
watching this again.

133
00:07:13,940 --> 00:07:14,940
He's the worst player of all time."

134
00:07:14,940 --> 00:07:17,420
You know what, I can't even do that.

135
00:07:17,420 --> 00:07:21,260
I've been doing it with New Vegas because you can't do that with Skate 3 or whatever.

136
00:07:21,260 --> 00:07:25,140
You can't do that with skate video games because it's all people trying to like, "I'm going

137
00:07:25,140 --> 00:07:26,940
to do triple backflip Christ Air."

138
00:07:26,940 --> 00:07:30,780
It's like you are not treating it like a simulation game.

139
00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:32,640
You are fucking up so bad.

140
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:33,980
You treat it like a simulation game?

141
00:07:33,980 --> 00:07:40,380
You put it on hardcore mode and then you try to do like actual cool shit not triple backflip

142
00:07:40,380 --> 00:07:43,700
Yeah, it doesn't sound cool. No trickliners

143
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:48,960
That's my message to you. I skate for comes out your day will come

144
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:53,660
That's a good thing. No your day will you will rue the day that?

145
00:07:53,660 --> 00:08:02,000
When you play skate, do you what do you have like a storyline for your guy when you're around you don't do that

146
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,240
No, it's just like, I wish I could do this in real life.

147
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:05,240
You don't do it like...

148
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:07,000
I always do. I always have a...

149
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,080
You have to.

150
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:08,440
What?

151
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:09,840
My mic stopped working for a second.

152
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:12,720
My storyline's like, my guy has a polyp in his stomach, he's gonna die.

153
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:13,560
Yeah.

154
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:16,560
It's becoming cancerous, he doesn't know it.

155
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:17,760
Yeah, and you're playing Mario Odyssey.

156
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:18,760
Yeah.

157
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:21,080
That's my storyline for every video game.

158
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:24,960
'Cause then that's a perfect, kind of like, in-canon explanation

159
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:26,760
for when I get bored and I never play the game again.

160
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:27,160
Yeah.

161
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:30,040
Like, oh, my guy got to the dinosaur kingdom and he died.

162
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:32,520
I do, I do, uh, yeah.

163
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:33,360
- He doesn't exist anymore, I can't play the game anymore.

164
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:35,520
- He played Mario Odyssey in the same way

165
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:36,840
that people play Grand Theft Auto,

166
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:38,440
where you just play it like a normal guy.

167
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:39,280
- Yeah, yeah.

168
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:40,100
- But I'm walking around.

169
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:42,600
Yeah, my story is that it's a make-a-wish kid

170
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:45,960
who wished he could do Mario for a day.

171
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:46,800
And then I made an entire plan for him.

172
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:48,280
- He never gets past the first level.

173
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:50,840
- No, he dies so fast, he dies so fast.

174
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:53,680
- And I play about 50 or 60 of those runs per day.

175
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:54,520
- Yeah.

176
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:55,360
(laughing)

177
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:56,440
Just die instantly.

178
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:58,560
- I give them a full name, a full backstory.

179
00:08:58,560 --> 00:08:59,400
- Yeah.

180
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:01,400
I hold a funeral for them in my apartment.

181
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:03,400
My girlfriend's like, "What are you doing?"

182
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:05,400
And I'm like, "Gregor died."

183
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:07,400
You're flushing a piece of paper down the toilet.

184
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:09,400
Like it's a fish funeral.

185
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:11,400
Yeah.

186
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:13,400
Man, I've been playing so much fucking New Vegas, though.

187
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:15,400
I don't know, like...

188
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:17,400
We should go to current Vegas.

189
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:19,400
We really should. I really would like to.

190
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:21,400
I was doing...

191
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:23,400
Exactly.

192
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:25,400
The Wisdom Tooth Recovery got me into New Vegas,

193
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:27,400
and I have not...

194
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:30,360
Nah, I think I have like 24 hours logged in.

195
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:31,200
I started like a week ago.

196
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:32,800
- By God, that's a day.

197
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:34,920
- Yeah, that's a whole day lost.

198
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:36,280
- In a week? - Fuck me, man.

199
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:37,660
A day in a week?

200
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:39,940
- That's almost three or four hours per day.

201
00:09:39,940 --> 00:09:40,780
- That's bloody long.

202
00:09:40,780 --> 00:09:43,400
- No, dude, it's like eight hours a day now.

203
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:44,880
- That math doesn't add up.

204
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:46,720
- I'm putting in the work in on my hot day ways.

205
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:47,720
- And you have way more than 24 hours.

206
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:49,160
- Yeah, I haven't checked in a while.

207
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:50,200
- Yeah.

208
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:51,400
- I don't wanna look at the number

209
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:53,560
of how much I've been playing it because--

210
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:54,760
- 'Cause you'll smile too much.

211
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:56,040
- It'll make me upset.

212
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:58,440
I just got my virtual reality goggles back.

213
00:09:58,440 --> 00:09:59,040
You got them back?

214
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:00,840
They got refurbished and I'm going to be--

215
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:01,520
They refurbished?

216
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:03,600
And I'll be entering a completely different reality

217
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:05,400
shortly after we finish this episode.

218
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:05,900
Yeah.

219
00:10:05,900 --> 00:10:07,040
I will be bye bye.

220
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:08,000
I will be gone.

221
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:08,520
Yeah.

222
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:10,000
I've been getting lost in my--

223
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,360
Mr. Gumdrop, my character.

224
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:12,920
I play a game where I'm God.

225
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:13,440
Yeah.

226
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:14,800
Yeah, I play a game where I'm God

227
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:16,680
and you can pick people up and just throw them off

228
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:17,320
the fucking world.

229
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:17,760
I'm the messiah of the wasteland.

230
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:18,320
No, you're not.

231
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:19,360
That's what it says in the game.

232
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:20,080
Fuck you, man.

233
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:21,320
I was talking to him yesterday.

234
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:21,760
You've played it.

235
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:22,320
You know what it says.

236
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:23,200
I've never played it.

237
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:25,540
- I was talking to Cameron yesterday about,

238
00:10:25,540 --> 00:10:28,460
I have been doing some Grand Theft Auto playing.

239
00:10:28,460 --> 00:10:29,300
- Yeah.

240
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:30,120
- GTA V and GTA IV.

241
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:31,720
- Do you play as Trevor?

242
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:33,080
Do you play as only Trevor?

243
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:35,560
- No, the online.

244
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:36,400
- Oh.

245
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:37,220
- Doing the online.

246
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:38,060
- Oh.

247
00:10:38,060 --> 00:10:41,000
- And I had, but I do also do the thing

248
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,860
where I think it's fun to pretend

249
00:10:42,860 --> 00:10:45,080
that I'm just a normal guy and walk around.

250
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:46,120
And I had one of the--

251
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:47,480
- You're playing free guy.

252
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:49,720
(laughing)

253
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:54,320
By the way, I love that movie.

254
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:56,080
I know you do.

255
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:57,440
That's why you love that movie.

256
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:58,120
I fucking love that movie.

257
00:10:58,120 --> 00:10:59,960
You love that movie because you get on GTA Online.

258
00:10:59,960 --> 00:10:59,960
100%.

259
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:00,760
Yeah, you just figured it out.

260
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:01,960
That is why I love that movie.

261
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:03,320
I've done that since I was a kid.

262
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:05,300
Play Grand Theft Auto, like you're just walking around,

263
00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:06,240
doing your thing.

264
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:07,120
You never run.

265
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:09,520
Because what am I running in my real life, right?

266
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:10,720
I just want to go--

267
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:12,560
You have the phone open.

268
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:13,840
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

269
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:16,320
Just calling my cousin, talking to my cousin,

270
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:18,840
fucking hitting guys up.

271
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:20,520
But I had one of the stupidest thoughts

272
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:23,000
I've ever had in my entire life the other day playing that game.

273
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,740
where I was at a red light,

274
00:11:25,740 --> 00:11:27,000
and you know you stop at the red lights

275
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:27,840
when you play like that,

276
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:29,300
and I was sitting at the red light,

277
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:31,760
and I was like, at some point I was like,

278
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:34,200
man, this red light's taking forever.

279
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:36,440
(laughing)

280
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:40,720
And I was like, why is this light taking so long?

281
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:42,440
Thinking that for whatever reason,

282
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:44,720
the people who make the game would be like

283
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:47,000
trying to make them a convenient time

284
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,680
between the red and the green lights,

285
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:51,480
and I couldn't believe that I--

286
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:54,760
takes place in Los Angeles and that traffic is bad as hell.

287
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:56,280
- Yeah, that is a really good point.

288
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:58,680
But like, of course the red lights take two minutes.

289
00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:00,240
They don't, when they were programming it,

290
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:02,000
they were never like, well people are gonna stop

291
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:02,840
at the red lights.

292
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:04,640
- They want, people who play that game normal

293
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:06,520
want the red lights so you can run it.

294
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:08,320
- Yeah. - They're criminals.

295
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:12,240
- There's a big GTA online RP community, I've learned.

296
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:14,920
- That makes sense. - Oh yeah, there's huge ones.

297
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:16,400
That's like the biggest fucking thing.

298
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:20,280
- It's like 13 year olds pretending to be gang members

299
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:21,120
and shit.

300
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:26,300
Even better is the roblox one. Oh, we're the roblox servers that are called Chicago. Yeah, just walk around

301
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:29,600
I love the videos that they make of so funny, man

302
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:36,600
Shot up my ops party

303
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:46,360
It's just like I do people are like just cuz you know voice comm so people are just typing in the the roblox chat like oh

304
00:12:46,540 --> 00:12:54,460
Shit, oh shit run. It's so funny when people like take that like RP so serious like we used to go into like the fucking

305
00:12:54,460 --> 00:12:58,100
Star Wars Star Wars our servers on

306
00:12:58,100 --> 00:13:05,680
I'm down. I love that shit, man. Yeah, I all I will say

307
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:09,820
The reason why I love it is because I always go into it thinking like oh

308
00:13:09,820 --> 00:13:14,740
Man, it might actually be fun to do this and then once I get in and it's not fun. It's not

309
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:17,540
- You literally start walking around with your open mic

310
00:13:17,540 --> 00:13:18,580
going (imitates buzzing)

311
00:13:18,580 --> 00:13:22,220
- The thing about RP servers on Gmod and stuff

312
00:13:22,220 --> 00:13:26,380
is that is the societal release valve

313
00:13:26,380 --> 00:13:28,540
where if those didn't exist,

314
00:13:28,540 --> 00:13:30,260
we would have the Nazi party again.

315
00:13:30,260 --> 00:13:31,900
(laughing)

316
00:13:31,900 --> 00:13:34,480
Those are the people who you log in and they're like,

317
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,420
okay, do this, do this, do this, do this, do this,

318
00:13:36,420 --> 00:13:38,860
and you have to stand in this room for 72 hours

319
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:40,540
before you can play the game.

320
00:13:40,540 --> 00:13:41,860
- The rules that they make,

321
00:13:41,860 --> 00:13:45,040
or it's so like, if you get hit with the fail RP in that,

322
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:48,600
you're getting reprimanded by like an ultra-neuro.

323
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:49,520
- It goes all the way up.

324
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:50,360
- Yeah.

325
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:51,200
- Yeah, they have a system.

326
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:52,800
- They have to get their super box in.

327
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:55,800
- They're literally building a virtual Reich

328
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:58,320
on a Star Wars TIE fighter or whatever.

329
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:00,640
- And they're not even, they're playing as the clones.

330
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:02,200
- Yeah, and they're playing as the clones.

331
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:03,040
- This shit is making me laugh.

332
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:04,680
- They're not even playing as the damn Empire.

333
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:05,600
- Yeah.

334
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:06,800
- It's fucked up.

335
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:09,720
I feel like the 501st Legion was a little bit chill,

336
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:11,080
from what I remember on the show.

337
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:12,960
- I don't, yeah, I'm just laughing.

338
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:13,800
- Clone Wars.

339
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:16,060
(laughter)

340
00:14:16,060 --> 00:14:17,400
- Okay, all right.

341
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:19,880
Clone Wars was one of those shows where people were like,

342
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:21,600
man, this is a good show.

343
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:22,440
- Yeah, that's what I was thinking.

344
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:24,200
- And then I would watch it and I was like, this is a tune.

345
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:27,480
- Well, that's what, I never cared about Star Wars.

346
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:28,600
- He's doing his head shake.

347
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:29,440
He's like, wow.

348
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:30,280
- Yeah.

349
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:31,100
- I'm like, that's what I'm saying.

350
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:31,940
- Well, that's the thing.

351
00:14:31,940 --> 00:14:33,320
- He's like, forget if you like the lore.

352
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:35,920
- That show, that show, that show Primal.

353
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:36,760
- Yeah.

354
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:38,120
- With the samurai jack guy.

355
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:38,960
It's the, so Clone Wars was--

356
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:39,800
- Jendi Tardadasti.

357
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:41,080
- Yeah, that guy, he did the,

358
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:42,280
I didn't know he did Clone Wars.

359
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:44,240
And I like watched Prime and I was like, oh, this is sick.

360
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:45,920
And I was like, I wonder what else this guy did.

361
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:48,520
And even loving Prime, I saw, oh, Clone Wars.

362
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:49,360
Oh, no.

363
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:50,200
Yeah, no.

364
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:52,040
I didn't like the 30 minute,

365
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:56,800
like the 30 minute long, like Clone Wars,

366
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:58,760
the Tardowoski ones.

367
00:14:58,760 --> 00:14:59,600
Didn't watch them.

368
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:00,420
Oh, you didn't watch?

369
00:15:00,420 --> 00:15:01,820
I have the DVD if you want it.

370
00:15:01,820 --> 00:15:05,400
See, I remember buying, when I like first got,

371
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:06,920
my dad got a Blu-ray player.

372
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:10,480
I bought like the first season of the Clone Wars on Blu-ray.

373
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:12,480
You're talking about the 3D one or the...

374
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:13,280
Dude, I don't know.

375
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:14,080
The Tardivash one.

376
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:15,580
The TV show.

377
00:15:15,580 --> 00:15:16,580
Yeah, there's two.

378
00:15:16,580 --> 00:15:17,380
Fuck you.

379
00:15:17,380 --> 00:15:18,680
The one that the Samurai Jack got made.

380
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:20,680
Shut up! Shut up!

381
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:22,080
I don't know what you're talking about.

382
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:23,280
There, we were talking about...

383
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:24,280
We were talking about two different things.

384
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:25,380
No, we're talking...

385
00:15:25,380 --> 00:15:26,380
There's this TV show.

386
00:15:26,380 --> 00:15:27,480
There was a Cartoon Network show.

387
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:29,480
There's two TV shows of the Clone Wars.

388
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:30,480
Whatever was the best...

389
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:31,580
The good one that people liked.

390
00:15:31,580 --> 00:15:33,580
The cartoon one or the 3D one?

391
00:15:33,580 --> 00:15:34,780
It's a 3D one.

392
00:15:34,780 --> 00:15:35,680
Okay.

393
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:36,480
That's all you had to say.

394
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:36,980
Okay, 3D one.

395
00:15:36,980 --> 00:15:38,280
You didn't have to tell me to shut up.

396
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:39,580
I'm really sorry.

397
00:15:39,580 --> 00:15:43,380
I'm really fucking sorry. I got way too into my RP Ray then. I'm sorry.

398
00:15:43,380 --> 00:15:44,980
You're doing jerk RP.

399
00:15:44,980 --> 00:15:47,620
I was doing jerk RP.

400
00:15:47,620 --> 00:15:53,780
But I bought the Blu-ray and I think I watched half of one episode and I was

401
00:15:53,780 --> 00:15:58,420
like, Oh yeah, I'm not 10 years old. I don't need to watch this video.

402
00:15:58,420 --> 00:16:03,700
I thought it was a video. These videos are not good. Is the 2D one better?

403
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:05,180
The 2D one is better.

404
00:16:05,180 --> 00:16:07,340
But the 3D one is the one that people like, right?

405
00:16:07,340 --> 00:16:11,020
- The 2D one is the one that the cool animator guy made.

406
00:16:11,020 --> 00:16:12,180
But I never watched either of them.

407
00:16:12,180 --> 00:16:15,500
- I don't give a fuck about Samurai Jack either, man.

408
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:16,420
- Yeah, me neither.

409
00:16:16,420 --> 00:16:17,740
- I watched both of them.

410
00:16:17,740 --> 00:16:19,780
(laughing)

411
00:16:19,780 --> 00:16:20,620
- The only Star Wars--

412
00:16:20,620 --> 00:16:23,300
- I always thought the name of the show Samurai Jack

413
00:16:23,300 --> 00:16:24,140
was so lame.

414
00:16:24,140 --> 00:16:25,700
I was like, fuck, I wanna watch something

415
00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:27,100
that sounds cool like Naruto.

416
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:27,940
- Yeah, exactly.

417
00:16:27,940 --> 00:16:28,760
- Or Bobobo.

418
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:30,100
- If I'm looking, listen, I'll say this much.

419
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:31,780
If I'm looking at a samurai,

420
00:16:31,780 --> 00:16:33,140
I don't want a white guy named Jack.

421
00:16:33,140 --> 00:16:34,300
- No.

422
00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:35,900
- Well, I don't think it's a white guy.

423
00:16:35,900 --> 00:16:36,740
- He's white.

424
00:16:36,740 --> 00:16:37,940
- I thought he was-- - His name's Jack.

425
00:16:37,940 --> 00:16:39,380
- Jackie Chan.

426
00:16:39,380 --> 00:16:42,220
- Jackie, you think Jackie Chan was born

427
00:16:42,220 --> 00:16:43,940
and they said, "Your name is Jackie."

428
00:16:43,940 --> 00:16:45,060
- Yes. - No.

429
00:16:45,060 --> 00:16:49,060
I'm not gonna say what his real name was.

430
00:16:49,060 --> 00:16:51,060
- What was his real name?

431
00:16:51,060 --> 00:16:52,100
- I'm not gonna say it.

432
00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:53,620
- All right. (laughs)

433
00:16:53,620 --> 00:16:54,460
Okay.

434
00:16:54,460 --> 00:16:55,420
- I'm not gonna say it. - You know Jackie Chan

435
00:16:55,420 --> 00:16:56,420
hates America?

436
00:16:56,420 --> 00:16:58,260
- He hates America and he hates his son.

437
00:16:58,260 --> 00:17:00,460
- He loves Chinese communism. - He loves China

438
00:17:00,460 --> 00:17:01,900
and he hates America. - He loves,

439
00:17:01,900 --> 00:17:04,380
Chan Kong Sang, that's what I thought,

440
00:17:04,380 --> 00:17:05,700
but I just didn't say it.

441
00:17:05,700 --> 00:17:06,540
That's his real name.

442
00:17:06,540 --> 00:17:07,540
- There's like a headline. - By the way,

443
00:17:07,540 --> 00:17:08,580
Juvio isn't pulling this up,

444
00:17:08,580 --> 00:17:10,260
but it says that on the screen.

445
00:17:10,260 --> 00:17:12,100
It says, "Ten Kong," there we go.

446
00:17:12,100 --> 00:17:13,860
Thank you so much.

447
00:17:13,860 --> 00:17:17,500
I did not just say, "Ten Kong song," just guessing.

448
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:18,820
That's his real name. - There's like some headline

449
00:17:18,820 --> 00:17:22,060
where it was like Jackie Chan saying how disappointed he was

450
00:17:22,060 --> 00:17:23,860
in his son. - That's 'cause his son,

451
00:17:23,860 --> 00:17:25,940
which I get this, his son was smoking reefer.

452
00:17:25,940 --> 00:17:27,940
- Oh, yeah. - And reefer in China

453
00:17:27,940 --> 00:17:30,060
is as bad as fucking freedom to them.

454
00:17:30,060 --> 00:17:31,660
It represents freeing your mind

455
00:17:31,660 --> 00:17:34,060
and being free from communistic,

456
00:17:34,060 --> 00:17:35,180
basically the same thing as,

457
00:17:35,180 --> 00:17:37,100
They're basically the same as Nazi Germany.

458
00:17:37,100 --> 00:17:37,940
Exactly.

459
00:17:37,940 --> 00:17:40,920
And so they were like, we have, there's a son.

460
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:42,600
That is not Jackie Chan, man.

461
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:44,020
That is not him, bro.

462
00:17:44,020 --> 00:17:47,640
But they were like, okay, we're gonna put your son in total,

463
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:51,040
in a, that's not Jackie Chan.

464
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:51,880
That's a bald guy.

465
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:54,380
That is a bald guy, Jubio.

466
00:17:54,380 --> 00:17:56,340
They were like, we're gonna put your son in a labor camp.

467
00:17:56,340 --> 00:17:59,320
And Jackie Chan said, fuck it, I don't give a fuck.

468
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:00,160
Damn.

469
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:00,980
Yeah.

470
00:18:00,980 --> 00:18:01,820
And then they killed his son.

471
00:18:01,820 --> 00:18:02,940
It's just kind of a shame 'cause Jackie Chan,

472
00:18:02,940 --> 00:18:04,980
you know, Jackie Chan, how often,

473
00:18:04,980 --> 00:18:07,260
How often can you be the number one movie star

474
00:18:07,260 --> 00:18:10,100
in both a communist and a free country?

475
00:18:10,100 --> 00:18:10,920
- Yeah. - Not that often.

476
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:11,760
- At the same time.

477
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:13,500
And he was just like, he saw, he was like,

478
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:15,820
"I'm double number one, I'm top of the charts,

479
00:18:15,820 --> 00:18:17,420
"music, movies, comics." - Double number one.

480
00:18:17,420 --> 00:18:18,620
- That makes him number 11. - Double number one,

481
00:18:18,620 --> 00:18:19,460
China, America. - Found you a pretty good

482
00:18:19,460 --> 00:18:22,460
Chinese restaurant too. (laughs)

483
00:18:22,460 --> 00:18:24,060
- China, America.

484
00:18:24,060 --> 00:18:26,340
We could have, he could have created a new country.

485
00:18:26,340 --> 00:18:27,180
- He could have, he definitely could have.

486
00:18:27,180 --> 00:18:28,900
- He could have created China, America.

487
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:30,600
- He could have bridged the gap.

488
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:32,860
- And instead he's like, "I hate America."

489
00:18:32,860 --> 00:18:33,860
- Yeah.

490
00:18:33,860 --> 00:18:36,860
- Double number one, that does sound like a good restaurant.

491
00:18:36,860 --> 00:18:39,260
(laughing)

492
00:18:39,260 --> 00:18:41,340
Yeah, no he is a piece of crap though.

493
00:18:41,340 --> 00:18:43,700
- Yeah, 'cause he's the reason nowadays

494
00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:46,220
that all this nuclear stuff's going down.

495
00:18:46,220 --> 00:18:48,340
90 seconds to midnight, did you see this?

496
00:18:48,340 --> 00:18:49,380
- No, what's that?

497
00:18:49,380 --> 00:18:51,300
- The doomsday clock, Patrick.

498
00:18:51,300 --> 00:18:52,820
- Oh yeah, I saw that.

499
00:18:52,820 --> 00:18:53,660
- 90 seconds to midnight.

500
00:18:53,660 --> 00:18:54,820
- That's not my problem.

501
00:18:54,820 --> 00:18:57,820
- So I saw this doomsday clock 90 seconds to midnight,

502
00:18:57,820 --> 00:19:00,300
I'm watching this time lapse of the doomsday clock

503
00:19:00,300 --> 00:19:02,260
since its creation.

504
00:19:02,260 --> 00:19:03,260
It's a horrible clock.

505
00:19:03,260 --> 00:19:03,760
That's right.

506
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:04,640
It's completely broken.

507
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:06,760
That clock started at four minutes.

508
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:12,080
Is it rush hour or Shanghai noon where they get on top of the doomsday clock?

509
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:13,440
Shanghai nights.

510
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:14,520
Shanghai noon.

511
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:15,280
Nights.

512
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:16,920
No, it's Jackie Chan and Owen Wilson.

513
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:18,920
There's a different movie I'm thinking of then.

514
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:19,680
Is it Owen Wilson?

515
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:20,600
Jackie Chan and Owen Wilson?

516
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:21,200
Yeah.

517
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:21,560
Yeah.

518
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:23,120
Around the World in 80 Days?

519
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:24,020
No, fuck you, man.

520
00:19:24,020 --> 00:19:25,400
That's a balloon movie.

521
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:27,800
Yeah, but that's Jackie Chan and Owen Wilson.

522
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:29,360
He's in a balloon the whole time or some shit.

523
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:31,320
That's like James and the Giant Peach.

524
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:32,080
It is not.

525
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:32,640
Yeah, it is.

526
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:33,480
James and the Giant Peach.

527
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:34,320
- It is. - 'Cause there's

528
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:35,560
a giant peach. - But the doomsday clock

529
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:38,300
is basically, we're doomed, is the day.

530
00:19:38,300 --> 00:19:39,720
- It's 90 seconds away.

531
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:40,960
- Thanks for explaining it.

532
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:42,080
(laughing)

533
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:43,320
- Basically, we're completely doomed,

534
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:45,160
so there's not even a point in even looking at the clock.

535
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:46,680
- Well, hey, I've been prepared.

536
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:48,760
I've been playing New Vegas all day.

537
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:50,720
- True. - I know exactly what to do.

538
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:52,200
- What's your, you know what, I just watched a video.

539
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:55,080
- I just have to get some power armor and some pinyon nuts.

540
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:57,680
- I just watched a video that doesn't, don't exist yet.

541
00:19:57,680 --> 00:19:59,440
I just watched a video that was a--

542
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:00,320
- What are you on about?

543
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:01,160
- They don't have it.

544
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:02,160
- What are you on about?

545
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:04,160
Dude, that's a great thing about the apocalypse.

546
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:06,160
You can just start speaking.

547
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:08,160
You can just start speaking.

548
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:10,160
Well, that's literally because

549
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:12,160
You play False Jubilee, because half the fucking

550
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:14,160
people in the burned down America

551
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:16,160
have British accents for some reason.

552
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:18,160
Because everybody went to a

553
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:20,160
theater and watched Mad Max Fury Road,

554
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:22,160
now when America is bombed

555
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:24,160
and it becomes a full desert, everyone will just

556
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:26,160
start acting like Mad Max.

557
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:28,160
Oh, this is... I saw that movie. This is what it's

558
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:30,160
going to be. Definitely the coolest version.

559
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:33,000
- There, I, exactly, everyone's just gonna start

560
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,760
immediately like, like burning shit down,

561
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:37,040
like stabbing people.

562
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:39,160
Why don't we just make a movie about the apocalypse

563
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:40,840
where it's like, it's actually chill.

564
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:41,840
- It's actually rather chill.

565
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:43,320
- I wanna see-- - It's actually chill as fuck

566
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:46,120
and we can just start like a new type of barter system.

567
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:47,440
- Calm, calm Cameron, yeah. - I wanna see,

568
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:48,280
calm as fuck.

569
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:49,880
- Kind of like a chill, what if instead of

570
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:51,960
everybody goes crazy, everybody just gets depressed

571
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:52,920
during the apocalypse?

572
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:53,760
- Damn. - Damn.

573
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:55,120
- Right, and it's you walking down the street.

574
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:57,000
Something in the way.

575
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:57,840
- Yeah. - Right, you're throwing,

576
00:20:57,840 --> 00:20:59,600
you're, Pete, you're about to drop--

577
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:00,680
- Boomsday.

578
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:03,520
- You're about to drop a bottle of something into--

579
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:04,360
- Absinthe.

580
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:05,180
- Into recycling.

581
00:21:05,180 --> 00:21:06,020
- Yeah, absinthe.

582
00:21:06,020 --> 00:21:06,840
- And then you're like, fuck it's the end of the world,

583
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:08,440
fuck it, throw it right on the ground.

584
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:09,720
(imitates explosion)

585
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:10,560
- Shatters.

586
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:12,280
- Jump in and away.

587
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:13,120
- Yeah, true.

588
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:15,020
- A dollar blows down the street and you just watch it.

589
00:21:15,020 --> 00:21:15,860
- You almost go to pick it up and say--

590
00:21:15,860 --> 00:21:16,680
- You just watch it.

591
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:19,120
- Oh shit, money doesn't mean fucking anything anymore.

592
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:19,960
- Do you think money would still be--

593
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:22,080
- Guess I needed this a whole lot a year ago,

594
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:23,760
but now it just seems like nothing.

595
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:25,160
Seems like a green piece of paper.

596
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:27,640
- What do you think the new money would be after?

597
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:28,480
- There wouldn't be any.

598
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:30,320
- No, 'cause they're, they clean their plates.

599
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:32,360
- Honestly, with bottle caps for water.

600
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:33,960
- It's so funny, it's like,

601
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:36,280
this, dollars, they don't mean anything anymore.

602
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:37,200
We need a new money.

603
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:38,320
- Yeah, bottle caps. - We need to come up

604
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:39,880
with something new. - Bottle caps.

605
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:42,700
- Honestly, dude, I hate to say it, women.

606
00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:46,840
Women's bodies is what would probably become,

607
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:48,520
it's the truth, it's so sad.

608
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:51,120
- And that's, in "Fury Road" it was like,

609
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:54,000
oh, like women have not been pregnant in a million years.

610
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,240
- Water, I believe. - Yeah, it was water

611
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:59,160
was money but women are not pregnant ever again.

612
00:21:59,160 --> 00:21:59,800
Wow.

613
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:00,680
Is that what it was?

614
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:01,880
Because they're lesbian.

615
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:06,880
Yeah, only pregnant women would come to the big guy.

616
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:09,160
Yeah, you're only allowed to get pregnant by him.

617
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:11,320
Only the big guy had pregnant women.

618
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:13,800
Charlize Theron, she had a short hair.

619
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:15,320
So a pregnant woman--

620
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:18,160
Well, so a pregnant woman maybe in that world

621
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:21,520
is not like money, but more like a peloton.

622
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:23,920
Or maybe someone who's really rich has one.

623
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:24,600
Yeah.

624
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:28,560
has a bunch. Yes, yes. Who has a bunch? You don't need more than one. If you're that fat,

625
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:33,640
like that big guy. Home Gym. Home Gym. That was his name, right? No. I thought you were

626
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:38,920
saying the guy named Home Gym. It was his name Joe. No, his name was Awesome. Oh, Home

627
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:50,280
Joe. Home Joe. Home Joe, yeah. I thought, I literally, I was thinking, who's Home Gym?

628
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:53,760
I know it was a Morton Joe, but I did think for a second it was a Morton Jim.

629
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:58,440
I do like the idea of a Morton Jim being like his twin brother.

630
00:22:58,440 --> 00:23:00,360
His twin brother in calm mass.

631
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:01,800
Gets no fucking hoes.

632
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:02,280
And he's making a face.

633
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:03,520
No pregnant women.

634
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:04,200
Anytime now.

635
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:05,240
No water.

636
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:06,040
He's skinny as fuck.

637
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:07,360
Skinny as hell, no hair.

638
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:08,120
No long hair.

639
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:11,000
He's making that face to the camera, but he's got silver all over his mouth.

640
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:15,000
He's got, he still has the fucking crazy gas mask thing, but he also has to wear

641
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,800
these thick glasses and his eyes look fucked up and big.

642
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:18,280
Here's the thing.

643
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:19,840
And he doesn't look cool with the mask.

644
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:25,820
First date with a more tan Joe. I'm making them fucking take a swim in the swimming pool. Yep, right take that makeup off

645
00:23:25,820 --> 00:23:29,820
That's right. Yeah, nasty ass wash that shit off. I want to see the real you a more

646
00:23:29,820 --> 00:23:33,440
God, you're covered in boils. I got a skeleton now

647
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:38,440
Put that mask back on you got acne under there. You got acne around your lip

648
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:43,280
You know cuz I that mask bro, but imagine imagine fucking him in the back of his car though

649
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:48,700
Me. Oh my god. You got that guy for you. He's playing birthday

650
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:50,880
Yeah, yeah, I'm birthday sex

No the guitar guy he had like no mouth he has no eyes no eyes yeah, well yeah, then he can't see you fucking

652
00:24:04,980 --> 00:24:09,140

00:24:09,140 --> 00:24:14,720
Afterwards I go from like smell my tube so my bro guess I stood

655
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:25,680
Oh smell your - guess what I just did. Oh, this is still in this scenario. Yeah

656
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:31,600
You know would be the worst part of the apocalypse is all the graffiti. Yeah, it'd be disgusting

657
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:36,000
I saw some graffiti putting up Monty Python references. Have you read this happen? I saw some graffiti

658
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:42,320
Today I walked here walk to the office. I don't usually walk but I saw about 10 minutes in my walk

659
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:48,040
I saw a graffiti that just said vagina. Oh, it's like I was like my tag. Well, I will that I was like, oh

660
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:54,480
That's funny. Some kid decided to write vagina on this. That's funny. And then ten minutes later

661
00:24:54,480 --> 00:25:01,040
I saw in a different color somebody wrote vagina like it's the guy's name. That's my tag your name. Your tag is not vagina

662
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:07,320
I've been throwing that up all around town. You've been throwing that vagina up all around town throwing up my vagina

663
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:13,760
Everywhere in town why look on the wall you'll see my I've been very prolific with my graffiti lately

664
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:19,520
I've been throwing up a lot of tags my tag is deli right, but it's just a normal font and I put it above stores damn

665
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:25,420
My I'm seeing you're like one of the most prolific writers. I guess believe in the smiley face killer no

666
00:25:25,420 --> 00:25:30,560
It's about killers. There's a theory bye-bye man. There's it shut up

667
00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:37,000
Don't say that man. Is that don't don't think it don't say it. I'm moving on there's

668
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,240
(laughing)

669
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:44,000
There's a theory, a real world theory.

670
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:44,840
- A theory.

671
00:25:44,840 --> 00:25:47,960
- A theory about different serial killers,

672
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:52,960
or that there's a murdering ring of psycho crazies.

673
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:54,160
- Congress.

674
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:56,400
- That there's apparently, there's an epidemic

675
00:25:56,400 --> 00:26:01,400
in this country of young men who walk home from bars

676
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:03,120
- Oh, and they get thrown in the river.

677
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:04,960
- They fall into the river banks.

678
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:05,800
- Yeah, yeah.

679
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:09,800
and they die. One of them was at the Charles River. Yeah, yeah. And at almost all of these...

680
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:13,800
I remember that. My mom thought it was me and called me. Really? She's not so smart.

681
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:17,800
She called me and was like, "Are you okay?" I was like, "Yeah, fucking...

682
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:21,800
I'm gonna go in the river." At almost all of the scenes of these crimes, or not crimes as Patrick would

683
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:25,800
have you believe, there are smiley face drawings.

684
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:29,800
Shoot. I feel like that's just a coincidence. What'd I tell you?

685
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:33,800
Yep. What did I tell you? Running interference. I knew that he would

686
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:38,200
be so terrified that he would ignore it. He's on the government payroll. He's on the government

687
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:40,760
payroll. He would ignore it. No, no, no. He's scared that it's going to happen to him and

688
00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:44,080
so he decides I'm going to push that out. Yeah, are you kidding? I'm the perfect candidate

689
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:48,680
for that. Don't say that publicly. Why? Because now you're going to die. I'm not going to

690
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:50,920
die. You're going to die. You'll easily be literally die. I'll never die. Stay away from

691
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:55,400
rivers. I'm so healthy I'll stay alive forever. Stay away from rivers, swimming pools, bathtubs,

692
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:59,360
oceans, lakes, ponds. I don't even. Rain puddles that are too deep. I live in a river desert.

693
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:02,160
You could definitely, I could definitely see you. Like a pool desert? I live in a river

694
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:06,680
desert. That's just a desert. There's no rivers around me. You go over the river every day.

695
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:10,780
I could definitely see... I don't mean to be rude, I could definitely see you drowning

696
00:27:10,780 --> 00:27:15,000
in a puddle on the side of the street. Nah. I could see myself falling asleep in the snow

697
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,560
and not knowing. You would see yourself in a puddle, reflection right before you fell

698
00:27:17,560 --> 00:27:21,120
into it and drowned. Yes. Your last thought would be, this guy's getting too close to

699
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:26,760
me. Caravan of Courage, the Ewoks movie? Nope. Oh. What the fuck is that, man? You watched

700
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:32,140
a whole movie about Ewoks? I'm gonna start, I think to start positivity and start positivity

701
00:27:32,140 --> 00:27:34,940
between males, I'm going to start the frowny face helper.

702
00:27:34,940 --> 00:27:35,780
- Ah!

703
00:27:35,780 --> 00:27:36,880
- The opposite of the smiley face killer.

704
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:39,760
I see a man walking home alone, drunk at night.

705
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:42,120
I walk up to him, I say,

706
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:43,520
"Hey buddy, let me help you get home."

707
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:45,200
And then I draw a frowny face on the ground.

708
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:47,440
- See, I like that, but you're engaging in the same

709
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:51,240
kind of horrific irony that the killer himself is doing.

710
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:53,120
- No, because it's the frowny face helper,

711
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:54,280
because why are they walking home alone?

712
00:27:54,280 --> 00:27:55,120
They're probably depressed.

713
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:57,640
- But you're, the frowny face is for the killer.

714
00:27:57,640 --> 00:27:58,460
- Yeah.

715
00:27:58,460 --> 00:27:59,300
- Oh.

716
00:27:59,300 --> 00:28:01,560
- It's like, "Oh, you better be sad."

717
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:04,680
- He can't put his tag up, 'cause you've already tagged it

718
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:05,600
and that'd be some toy shit.

719
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:09,240
- The scariest part about this whole serial killer thing,

720
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:12,240
the smiley face killer, it's organized on 4chan.

721
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:13,480
- Ew. - No.

722
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:15,080
- Yeah, so you know they're-- - That's incel vibes.

723
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:16,360
- You know they're right wing dirtbags.

724
00:28:16,360 --> 00:28:18,120
- That's literally fucking incel mashup vibes.

725
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:20,480
- Yeah, that's the website that cultivated

726
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:22,200
and created the meme of Pedo Bear.

727
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:23,280
- Yep. - Yes, yes.

728
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:26,400
- And they think that things like that is enjoyable.

729
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:27,240
- You know what else they made?

730
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:28,060
- What else did they make?

731
00:28:28,060 --> 00:28:29,400
- Freaking Pepe the frog.

732
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:32,160
I heard they made a Pokemon ROM hack.

733
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:33,000
- Fuck me.

734
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:36,040
- They hacked a game that was not their property.

735
00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:36,960
- Say psych.

736
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:37,800
- Say less.

737
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:38,620
- Please say psych.

738
00:28:38,620 --> 00:28:42,800
- I heard they made an 8x8 image with a bunch of different

739
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:45,920
album covers of different underground artists on it.

740
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:48,120
- I heard that they did that and they made a chart

741
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:51,080
that was meant to lead youths, preppy youths,

742
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:54,880
down the path of emo, goth, sulking, mopey,

743
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:58,360
aggressive, violent, electronic, distorted.

744
00:28:58,360 --> 00:28:59,200
Maybe that's how-- - You know what?

745
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:00,020
I heard that they-- - Oh my God.

746
00:29:00,020 --> 00:29:01,440
- I heard they were responsible for--

747
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:02,760
- Music with those adjectives. - For getting people,

748
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:05,400
people getting into friggin' the money store

749
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:06,720
and the deep web. - Wait, I think I'm realizing

750
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:07,560
how this happened. - I think that's true.

751
00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:10,720
- I think the smiley face serial killers,

752
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:13,040
the way that they get young men to join

753
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:14,840
into their ring of murderers,

754
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:16,980
is that they make these starter packs.

755
00:29:16,980 --> 00:29:17,820
They get 'em listening to Pink Floyd.

756
00:29:17,820 --> 00:29:19,320
- Oh my God. - They get 'em listening

757
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:20,880
to Swans. - Fuck.

758
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:23,520
- Oh, ew! - All this psychotic bullshit.

759
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:24,360
- Yeah. - Right?

760
00:29:24,360 --> 00:29:25,200
They get-- - And what, and what--

761
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:27,540
- Bad melody. - And what swims in a river?

762
00:29:27,540 --> 00:29:33,680
Officious swans. Oh fuck and especially in the Charles River. All right, you're right. They got swan boats there

763
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:36,820
So then these guys are those are big swans. These guys are running around

764
00:29:36,820 --> 00:29:44,360
Those are those are real fucking animals are big animals. Somebody should call PETA about that. Yeah. Yeah, fucking Christ

765
00:29:44,360 --> 00:29:51,180
Who's PETA PETA who yeah PETA in the child Griffin? Yeah, exactly. All right moving on. Yeah, we've already done

766
00:29:51,180 --> 00:29:53,420
No, I was I'd yep

767
00:29:53,700 --> 00:29:58,740
You I said PETA and I laughed so I had to finish it out even though I knew it was nothing

768
00:29:58,740 --> 00:30:03,020
I think it was something. I really don't think it was I think it was something Cameron. I

769
00:30:03,020 --> 00:30:05,580
Think that I will be joining the military

770
00:30:05,580 --> 00:30:10,180
Nope

771
00:30:10,180 --> 00:30:13,920
Wanted to announce this publicly I'm joining the military they wouldn't want you

772
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:20,300
First of all they would accept me and I'm they would see the height requirement

773
00:30:20,300 --> 00:30:25,500
They would see all the footage of you playing jerk RP.

774
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:27,180
And they'd say, "That guy."

775
00:30:27,180 --> 00:30:29,620
There's only one single clip of me playing jerk RP.

776
00:30:29,620 --> 00:30:31,540
No, there's a lot of you playing jerk RP.

777
00:30:31,540 --> 00:30:32,540
No, there's not.

778
00:30:32,540 --> 00:30:33,540
I'm not a jerk.

779
00:30:33,540 --> 00:30:35,660
There's probably 300 clips of you playing jerk RP.

780
00:30:35,660 --> 00:30:36,660
That's a fucking lie.

781
00:30:36,660 --> 00:30:37,900
Probably 300 hours.

782
00:30:37,900 --> 00:30:41,300
I was being a jerk for one instance where I told you to shut up because you were talking

783
00:30:41,300 --> 00:30:42,300
nonsense.

784
00:30:42,300 --> 00:30:43,300
I was not talking nonsense.

785
00:30:43,300 --> 00:30:44,860
I was talking about- You were talking about Star Wars.

786
00:30:44,860 --> 00:30:46,380
I was talking about real shit.

787
00:30:46,380 --> 00:30:47,380
No, you weren't.

788
00:30:47,380 --> 00:30:48,380
Real shit that happened.

789
00:30:48,380 --> 00:30:49,380
You actually were not talking about real shit.

790
00:30:49,380 --> 00:30:51,180
Caravan of Courage, I was talking about that.

791
00:30:51,180 --> 00:30:52,720
- No you weren't, that was a different time.

792
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:55,180
- Yep, he puts his, oh yeah, I didn't even,

793
00:30:55,180 --> 00:30:58,340
he touches the pond and then he gets trapped under it.

794
00:30:58,340 --> 00:31:00,220
He gets trapped under the pond, yeah.

795
00:31:00,220 --> 00:31:01,860
Mace, Sindel's brother.

796
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:02,940
- Mace Wundu?

797
00:31:02,940 --> 00:31:04,960
- No, it's a white guy.

798
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:07,140
- Mace Wundu, is it white?

799
00:31:07,140 --> 00:31:10,020
- Something, Mace, he's a boy,

800
00:31:10,020 --> 00:31:12,860
and they're looking for their parents and their Ewoks.

801
00:31:12,860 --> 00:31:16,780
- Your eyes have nothing behind them anymore.

802
00:31:16,780 --> 00:31:18,740
I'm looking into them, there's nothing.

803
00:31:18,740 --> 00:31:21,100
What are you on, Jubio?

804
00:31:21,100 --> 00:31:22,460
What was that?

805
00:31:22,460 --> 00:31:25,940
Why was there a Reddit 18+ page that you had to click?

806
00:31:25,940 --> 00:31:26,780
'Cause he's just doing his thing, man.

807
00:31:26,780 --> 00:31:27,780
What are you looking up, man?

808
00:31:27,780 --> 00:31:30,260
Stop looking at fucking nasty sex, man.

809
00:31:30,260 --> 00:31:31,900
DM if you want a jerk.

810
00:31:31,900 --> 00:31:32,740
You're distracting Patrick.

811
00:31:32,740 --> 00:31:33,860
Yeah, dude, I want a jerk.

812
00:31:33,860 --> 00:31:35,220
I will say, this is cool.

813
00:31:35,220 --> 00:31:39,260
If they did a real life Simpsons, it would have to be PG.

814
00:31:39,260 --> 00:31:40,540
Yeah.

815
00:31:40,540 --> 00:31:41,380
PG.

816
00:31:41,380 --> 00:31:42,200
Paul Giamatti.

817
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:43,040
It would have to be PG-13, maybe.

818
00:31:43,040 --> 00:31:45,260
It would have to be PG-13 because the jokes

819
00:31:45,260 --> 00:31:46,260
would be a little inappropriate.

820
00:31:46,260 --> 00:31:47,100
Wait, was the Simpsons movie PG-13?

821
00:31:47,100 --> 00:31:48,660
Well, I think if they, yeah,

822
00:31:48,660 --> 00:31:51,160
because they showed Bart's doodle finger.

823
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:55,460
I would hope that if they did a live action

824
00:31:55,460 --> 00:31:57,540
Homer Simpson movie, that they would,

825
00:31:57,540 --> 00:32:00,020
I mean, so it could be PG, Paul Giamatti,

826
00:32:00,020 --> 00:32:02,460
but I would love for them to do kind of like

827
00:32:02,460 --> 00:32:05,180
a worldwide talent search and find the most,

828
00:32:05,180 --> 00:32:07,140
'cause you know, he looks like Homer,

829
00:32:07,140 --> 00:32:09,460
but there's gotta be someone in some country

830
00:32:09,460 --> 00:32:10,820
that looks even more like Homer.

831
00:32:10,820 --> 00:32:12,380
- Looks and acts like Homer.

832
00:32:12,380 --> 00:32:13,500
- Yeah, could even be in the US,

833
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:15,260
but I want them to search all around the world.

834
00:32:15,260 --> 00:32:16,780
- Could even be in this room.

835
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:20,800
I'm not so, I don't, I see, you don't look like Homer at all.

836
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:21,760
- You don't look like Homer.

837
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:24,680
You look like, you look like Krusty's monkey.

838
00:32:24,680 --> 00:32:25,520
- A little bit like Homer.

839
00:32:25,520 --> 00:32:27,520
- You look more like the evil monkey from Family Guy.

840
00:32:27,520 --> 00:32:28,360
- Look at the white shirt.

841
00:32:28,360 --> 00:32:29,860
- Do that again, do that again.

842
00:32:29,860 --> 00:32:32,000
You look a little more like--

843
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,760
- You legit, you look like Curious George.

844
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:34,800
(laughing)

845
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:36,080
You look like Curious George

846
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:38,360
and Cameron should be the yellow guy.

847
00:32:38,360 --> 00:32:40,080
- The man in the yellow hat, the yellow guy.

848
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:43,440
You know every fucking name of every Ewok

849
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:45,000
that's ever been drawn.

850
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:45,840
- Not true, I only know Wicked and Lowbring.

851
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:52,320
You don't know the man with the yellow hat. No. The human from Curious What? I was talking about this yellow guy. That's Homer.

852
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:58,200
You don't look like Homer. You don't look anything like Homer. Stop doing that. You don't look like Homer.

853
00:32:58,200 --> 00:33:04,880
You don't you don't. Do you think Marge would confuse us? No. No. As twin brothers? With that white shirt and

854
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:07,320
this face you're doing

855
00:33:07,320 --> 00:33:09,400

On the doorknob

- They didn't know how big they did.

886
00:34:57,560 --> 00:35:00,040
- They didn't know what silicon was.

887
00:35:00,040 --> 00:35:01,360
- They started throwing whatever in there.

888
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:03,200
- Silicone or silicon?

889
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:06,200
- Silicon is the valley, silicon is the--

890
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:12,740
Human creation well, it's not a human creation, but yeah, it's an inhuman creation it is in human creation station burning it

891
00:35:12,740 --> 00:35:17,680
Wait, okay. Why is not a human creation? Well rubber is is

892
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:24,860
Is like a plant yeah, but is silicone growth the plant don't do they make silicone rubber is from a tree

893
00:35:24,860 --> 00:35:26,860
They probably size it yeah

00:35:26,860 --> 00:35:29,560
synthetic rubber

895
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:31,560

I want to talk about low-grade nobody gives a fuck

899
00:35:48,360 --> 00:35:54,480
People literally there are hundreds of people who care about synthetic rubber, and there's not a single person on earth who cares about you walk

900
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:56,480
I'm gonna

901
00:35:56,480 --> 00:36:01,680
Get back to talk about synthetic rubber guess what hey here's the least here's the thing you walk mask

902
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:03,080
- Guess what it's made out of?

903
00:36:03,080 --> 00:36:03,900
- What?

904
00:36:03,900 --> 00:36:05,080
- Synthetic rubber.

905
00:36:05,080 --> 00:36:07,120
- So I saw this video actually yesterday

906
00:36:07,120 --> 00:36:10,320
of their rolling silicone, like this.

907
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:11,400
- What do you mean they're rolling it?

908
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:13,080
- They had big bunches of it

909
00:36:13,080 --> 00:36:14,640
and they're putting it onto a roller

910
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:16,560
and it was flattening out and squeezing.

911
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:17,400
- That's so awesome.

912
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:19,680
- It was cool and I asked my girlfriend,

913
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:23,200
is that, I said is that Airheads?

914
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:25,440
And she said, no!

915
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:26,280
I said why?

916
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:27,920
And she said 'cause it's giant.

917
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:29,080
- Where were you watching it?

918
00:36:29,080 --> 00:36:30,880
- Facebook Watch.

919
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:32,200
- Just on the TV?

920
00:36:32,200 --> 00:36:33,040
- The phone.

921
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:35,960
I was spying on my girlfriend's phone.

922
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:37,120
- I do that a lot.

923
00:36:37,120 --> 00:36:38,280
- I said, "Is that Airheads?"

924
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:41,080
And she said, "No, it's, look it, it's so big."

925
00:36:41,080 --> 00:36:43,000
And I was like, "Well, I don't know, they could cut it up."

926
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:43,840
- Yeah.

927
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:44,660
- And then I said, "Well, what is it then?"

928
00:36:44,660 --> 00:36:45,960
She was like, "I don't know."

929
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:46,800
- Here's what I like to do.

930
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:47,620
- I just, I really like--

931
00:36:47,620 --> 00:36:49,600
- Turns out it was silicone on a big roller.

932
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:51,760
- Like, peering over someone's shoulder

933
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:54,480
and it's just like a video, just factory stuff,

934
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:55,320
just going on, that's so funny.

935
00:36:55,320 --> 00:36:57,160
- You don't, that doesn't happen to you?

936
00:36:57,160 --> 00:36:58,000
- No.

937
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,000
all the time. Is that airheads?

938
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,000
Here's what...

939
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,000
Are they making airheads?

940
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,000
You're watching somebody on live.

941
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,000
Somebody on live on the train.

942
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,000
I'm like, oh.

943
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,000
Here's what I love doing.

944
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,000
If my wife is sitting on the couch

945
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,000
and she's on her phone, I love walking up and being like

946
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,000
who the fuck are you talking to?

947
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,000
And then she's playing like Poppy Jump or Talking Ben

948
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,000
or looking at a photo of her mom.

949
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,000
She's playing Talking Ben?

950
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,000
Yeah, you know, past the time. Sunday afternoon.

951
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:33,000
She's learning. She's learning colors and shapes. It's cool.

952
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:36,000
We're talking Tom, or one of the more adult versions.

953
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,000
Who the fuck are you talking to?

954
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,000
Who the fuck are you talking to?

955
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:43,000
Who the fuck is that?

956
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:44,000
Who the fuck is that?

957
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:49,000
Oh, now he's making fun of me. Awesome, you asshole. Now you're making fun of me, you asshole.

958
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,000

959
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:52,000
Luger says what?

960
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,760
(laughing)

961
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:55,560
- Got your ass!

962
00:37:55,560 --> 00:37:56,400
- Who says what?

963
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:57,220
- Who says what?

964
00:37:57,220 --> 00:37:58,060
- What?

965
00:37:58,060 --> 00:37:58,900
Oh, fuck!

966
00:37:58,900 --> 00:38:00,720
(laughing)

967
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:02,840
- Those games are actually so much fun.

968
00:38:02,840 --> 00:38:04,360
- Remember that video?

969
00:38:04,360 --> 00:38:06,200
It's like the neighbor's fighting,

970
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:07,240
and the guy says,

971
00:38:07,240 --> 00:38:10,400
I don't know, I can't find it,

972
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:11,720
I don't remember it that well.

973
00:38:11,720 --> 00:38:13,640
He says like, "Dumbass says what?"

974
00:38:13,640 --> 00:38:15,480
And then his wife immediately goes, "What?"

975
00:38:15,480 --> 00:38:17,040
- Yeah, I do remember that.

976
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:19,120
Crazy irate neighbors.

977
00:38:19,120 --> 00:38:20,080
- Yeah.

978
00:38:20,080 --> 00:38:21,580
- That's the name of the video.

979
00:38:21,580 --> 00:38:22,580
I need to watch more.

980
00:38:22,580 --> 00:38:23,580
It's a really good video.

- Ewoks is an animal that if it was a real animal,

1005
00:39:43,320 --> 00:39:46,020
I would be one of those guys who lives in India

00:40:16,860 --> 00:40:17,860
Do they have intelligence?

1026
00:40:17,860 --> 00:40:18,860
Yeah.

1027
00:40:18,860 --> 00:40:19,860
Or are they animals?

1028
00:40:19,860 --> 00:40:20,860
Have you seen Return of the Jedi?

1029
00:40:20,860 --> 00:40:21,860
Do they have an academic culture?

1030
00:40:21,860 --> 00:40:22,860
Oh yeah, they fight with spears.

1031
00:40:22,860 --> 00:40:25,180
Yeah, they fight with spears and they have a bunch of traps and loads.

1032
00:40:25,180 --> 00:40:26,180
Yes, very intelligent.

1033
00:40:26,180 --> 00:40:28,620
They can make hang gliders.

1034
00:40:28,620 --> 00:40:29,620
They can make hang gliders.

1035
00:40:29,620 --> 00:40:30,620
Oh wow.

1036
00:40:30,620 --> 00:40:31,620
I can't make a hang glider.

1037
00:40:31,620 --> 00:40:32,620
They say like, "chuta!"

1038
00:40:32,620 --> 00:40:33,620
Oh.

1039
00:40:33,620 --> 00:40:34,620
They say that.

1040
00:40:34,620 --> 00:40:35,620
Isn't that what Borat calls a pussy?

1041
00:40:35,620 --> 00:40:36,620
I think so, yeah.

1042
00:40:36,620 --> 00:40:37,620
It is.

1043
00:40:37,620 --> 00:40:38,620
Oh my god.

1044
00:40:38,620 --> 00:40:39,620
Ewoks are fucking disgusting.

1045
00:40:39,620 --> 00:40:40,620
Oh my god, they're horny as hell.

1046
00:40:40,620 --> 00:40:41,620
Ewoks are horny as hell.

1047
00:40:41,620 --> 00:40:42,620
Ewoks are horny as hell.

1048
00:40:42,620 --> 00:40:46,040
Fucking disgusting. Oh my god. They're horny as hell. That makes a lot of sense now

1049
00:40:46,040 --> 00:40:51,760
So I wicked was like humping Bleya's leg in that movie wickets a little one with the orange hat

1050
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:55,700
I thought that was a wicked work or a cricket thing. I'm cricket a

1051
00:40:55,700 --> 00:41:04,420
Wicked space a cricket spacer hold holder through her that's got to be the worst sport ever made

1052
00:41:04,420 --> 00:41:11,140
Yeah, who the fuck invented cricket man cricket the British tell you who invented cricket somebody who was heavily invested in the wood world

1053
00:41:11,140 --> 00:41:13,980
Yeah, hey, you know what I know I can make fucking

1054
00:41:13,980 --> 00:41:20,220
No, don't don't laugh when I say this, but it was probably created by big wood and don't laugh at big wood

1055
00:41:20,220 --> 00:41:27,300
But it was probably created by the wood industry big. Okay. I can't even hide my smirk. Don't laugh. Okay

1056
00:41:27,300 --> 00:41:33,140
So I don't want you to and don't laugh at this either big cricket. Okay, here's a here's the thing

1057
00:41:37,020 --> 00:41:38,780
Big cricket is scary

1058
00:41:38,780 --> 00:41:44,300
You know why they call it cricket because it's a damn thing that's making the making noise when that games happening

1059
00:41:44,300 --> 00:41:46,340
Yeah, cricket cricket

1060
00:41:46,340 --> 00:41:51,940
Boring well no I think that's like a rule is you're not supposed to make any noise when they can make no I've seen videos

1061
00:41:51,940 --> 00:41:54,780
Of people playing are you signing up for a phone on cricket?

1062
00:41:54,780 --> 00:41:56,940
Why are you shut up the cricket is?

1063
00:41:56,940 --> 00:42:01,380
Got to be the best worst sport of all time best worst sport not early

1064
00:42:01,380 --> 00:42:05,760
Curling is cool curling is okay any sport that has ice in it is good

1065
00:42:06,380 --> 00:42:13,060
Yeah, yeah, what about ice cricket? What if that that would that's a that would be cool if that exists ice field hockey

1066
00:42:13,060 --> 00:42:18,820
I haven't seen that I

1067
00:42:18,820 --> 00:42:22,500
I'm standing by any sport that has ice in it is cool period

1068
00:42:22,500 --> 00:42:27,900
What it's just cool to be on ice. I'm trying to miss a bad one. There isn't one

1069
00:42:27,900 --> 00:42:34,420
Ice assault yeah, yeah, how about ice assault? I guess ice assault sucks. Yeah, I never considered that

1070
00:42:34,420 --> 00:42:37,860
There's no rules to the game and that you can't even watch it anywhere, so it's really boring

1071
00:42:37,860 --> 00:42:39,860
But there's a winner and a loser for sure yeah

1072
00:42:39,860 --> 00:42:42,820
Kind of it's kind of funny though because they're all slipping and sliding

1073
00:42:42,820 --> 00:42:48,820
You're saying if I'm if someone tried to assault somebody on a ice rink

1074
00:42:48,820 --> 00:42:53,780
Yeah, I'm not sure I understand if they don't both of them don't have ice skates is what I'm saying

1075
00:42:53,780 --> 00:42:55,860
So it's kind of like a Charlie Chaplin

1076
00:42:55,860 --> 00:43:00,300
Kind of like yeah, I remember all those episodes of Charlie Chaplin where the guy

1077
00:43:03,100 --> 00:43:08,920
Where you bringing rape into it as you said assault is not it doesn't always mean that when you know

1078
00:43:08,920 --> 00:43:16,100
On ice it does actually you know what I think if there was like a gladiator style thing on ice

1079
00:43:16,100 --> 00:43:18,560
That would be a very cool sport. That's a fight

1080
00:43:18,560 --> 00:43:23,620
Also, that's ice fight. They just do that on hockey. Yeah. Yeah, that's like 10%

1081
00:43:23,620 --> 00:43:27,380
But also the cool part of that is is that it's a glove. I think you could do a gladiator fight

1082
00:43:31,540 --> 00:43:36,420
I don't have to be on ice. As long as it's not Christians getting fucking murdered because

1083
00:43:36,420 --> 00:43:41,900
that is the craziest shit. It has to be one Christian versus one Jewish. Is that what

1084
00:43:41,900 --> 00:43:46,900
you're saying? That's what you're saying should be the rules of ice assault, yeah. No. A Christian

1085
00:43:46,900 --> 00:43:50,820
I'm not saying that's what the rules should be. Patrick made a game called ice assault

1086
00:43:50,820 --> 00:43:56,020
that is a gladiatorial style ice thing. As he says a Christian versus a Jewish on ice.

1087
00:43:56,020 --> 00:44:01,660
No, tell you what I don't listen gladiatorial. I love I love my I love my okay

1088
00:44:01,660 --> 00:44:07,020
Well, usually in glad there's a but in gladiator in gladiatorial games. It's a guy versus an animal. So what are you saying?

1089
00:44:07,020 --> 00:44:09,660
buddy or the Christians

1090
00:44:09,660 --> 00:44:11,940
glaciating

1091
00:44:11,940 --> 00:44:18,900
Glaciators glaciators listen it could be called. I don't God this is the best the Coliseum. Oh my god good in

1092
00:44:18,900 --> 00:44:22,300
Cold guys were not on board at first

1093
00:44:22,300 --> 00:44:26,940
but now I was on board for anything where people fight and kill each other.

1094
00:44:26,940 --> 00:44:30,140
Okay, so Cameron was on board the whole time. I don't know about you.

1095
00:44:30,140 --> 00:44:35,580
If I was a millionaire billionaire, I would fund a blood sport.

1096
00:44:35,580 --> 00:44:36,300
No, you wouldn't.

1097
00:44:36,300 --> 00:44:40,620
I would. I would want to. If they tried to stop me, I'd do it anyway and go to jail.

1098
00:44:40,620 --> 00:44:49,660
If you think if like Elon Musk or like JF Bezos, you think those two motherfuckers were like,

1099
00:44:49,660 --> 00:44:52,160
"Yeah, we're gonna have like, we've been training these

1100
00:44:52,160 --> 00:44:55,840
"warriors for like three years secretly,

1101
00:44:55,840 --> 00:44:57,020
"and we're gonna have like a big duel."

1102
00:44:57,020 --> 00:44:58,560
- Nobody can stop them.

1103
00:44:58,560 --> 00:45:00,600
- Yeah, but imagine that. - If I'm Elon Musk,

1104
00:45:00,600 --> 00:45:03,060
I fund Gladiator Games, they try to stop me.

1105
00:45:03,060 --> 00:45:03,900
Do you know what I'm doing?

1106
00:45:03,900 --> 00:45:06,080
I'm getting horns installed on my head,

1107
00:45:06,080 --> 00:45:07,740
I'm changing my name to Demon Musk,

1108
00:45:07,740 --> 00:45:09,140
and I'm taking over the world.

1109
00:45:09,140 --> 00:45:09,980
- That's true.

1110
00:45:09,980 --> 00:45:11,380
I guess it is true that like,

1111
00:45:11,380 --> 00:45:14,580
if you go make a private island or something,

1112
00:45:14,580 --> 00:45:18,220
you can do that shit as long as you don't like

1113
00:45:18,220 --> 00:45:20,220
find oil accidentally while you're like fucking...

1114
00:45:20,220 --> 00:45:22,220
(laughter)

1115
00:45:22,220 --> 00:45:24,220
There's somebody throwing a spear at a guy

1116
00:45:24,220 --> 00:45:26,220
and like a baby's head and misses and hits

1117
00:45:26,220 --> 00:45:28,220
fucking the ground.

1118
00:45:28,220 --> 00:45:30,220
Just right then you and choppers come in,

1119
00:45:30,220 --> 00:45:32,220
everybody's dead. But until that point

1120
00:45:32,220 --> 00:45:34,220
you're fine, like you can just do that. There's no

1121
00:45:34,220 --> 00:45:36,220
law above you until you have some

1122
00:45:36,220 --> 00:45:38,220
until you have some kind of iPhone ingredient.

1123
00:45:38,220 --> 00:45:40,220
Yeah, that's true.

1124
00:45:40,220 --> 00:45:42,220
Imagine they're building like...

1125
00:45:42,220 --> 00:45:44,220
They're building this big

1126
00:45:44,220 --> 00:45:46,220
coliseum because they've been training

1127
00:45:46,220 --> 00:45:50,980
warriors for like months and then out of nowhere they just stumble upon like the

1128
00:45:50,980 --> 00:45:56,220
biggest lithium deposit. You're pretty much instantly there's gonna be

1129
00:45:56,220 --> 00:46:01,380
5,000 UFO sightings yeah and people are gonna be like oh whoa UFOs and really

1130
00:46:01,380 --> 00:46:06,260
yeah while you guys are looking at UFOs we had to go and stop that gladiator

1131
00:46:06,260 --> 00:46:11,460
the glaciators yeah we had to destroy the glaciators. We had to wipe the entire thing out.

1132
00:46:11,460 --> 00:46:16,100
I feel like I feel like every single person in the country

1133
00:46:16,100 --> 00:46:21,340
would change their opinion on Elon and Jeff Bezos if they were like, "Yeah, we've brought

1134
00:46:21,340 --> 00:46:22,340
back the Coliseum."

1135
00:46:22,340 --> 00:46:26,220
Oh my God, every rich guy should have a few warriors that they train and then they all

1136
00:46:26,220 --> 00:46:27,220
go in a tournament.

1137
00:46:27,220 --> 00:46:28,220
Yeah.

1138
00:46:28,220 --> 00:46:29,220
All the warriors go.

1139
00:46:29,220 --> 00:46:31,460
And the two rich guys get to sit in the big thrones.

1140
00:46:31,460 --> 00:46:32,460
Oh my God.

1141
00:46:32,460 --> 00:46:34,620
Like the emperor and do the thumbs up, thumbs down.

1142
00:46:34,620 --> 00:46:36,820
But it would be a like button and a dislike button.

1143
00:46:36,820 --> 00:46:37,820
Probably these days.

1144
00:46:37,820 --> 00:46:39,500
Can you imagine the comments on that live?

1145
00:46:39,500 --> 00:46:40,500
Yeah, they would be-

1146
00:46:40,500 --> 00:46:41,500
They'd be funny as hell.

1147
00:46:41,500 --> 00:46:42,500
They would be really funny.

1148
00:46:42,500 --> 00:46:43,500
Mine would probably be-

1149
00:46:43,500 --> 00:46:49,340
String they call the guy string bean or something. Yeah, he would like keep winning and they're like damn string beans on a tear

1150
00:46:49,340 --> 00:46:53,820
That's true. Imagine the F's that they would send when someone got their head you

1151
00:46:53,820 --> 00:46:59,540
String bean finally gets snapped get it all imagine the ruskies reaction of that. Oh

1152
00:46:59,540 --> 00:47:02,660
my god, Drew ski and Jack Harlow or

1153
00:47:02,660 --> 00:47:06,900
commentators for glaciators their BFS and that would be

1154
00:47:06,900 --> 00:47:13,060
Fucking sick here comes string bean. He looks like she is this that's Jack Harlow. Okay

1155
00:47:13,060 --> 00:47:15,300
(laughing)

1156
00:47:15,300 --> 00:47:16,780
- What's the impression of?

1157
00:47:16,780 --> 00:47:19,260
- Basically, Stringbee's one of my favorite players

1158
00:47:19,260 --> 00:47:20,260
in the whole game.

1159
00:47:20,260 --> 00:47:22,880
And he basically, oh, he just got his head

1160
00:47:22,880 --> 00:47:24,460
completely ripped off.

1161
00:47:24,460 --> 00:47:25,300
Damn.

1162
00:47:25,300 --> 00:47:27,900
- No, I don't think, Cameron, do you wanna be Drewski?

1163
00:47:27,900 --> 00:47:29,980
- One of you, listen, I already grabbed Jack Harlow,

1164
00:47:29,980 --> 00:47:31,820
so one of you two has to be Drewski.

1165
00:47:31,820 --> 00:47:34,700
- I actually, okay, it'll be Jack Harlow and Pee Wee Herman.

1166
00:47:34,700 --> 00:47:37,060
- No, no, you already said Drewski, go ahead.

1167
00:47:37,060 --> 00:47:38,700
- I've been working with Drewski lately.

1168
00:47:38,700 --> 00:47:39,540
- No, you haven't. - Really?

1169
00:47:39,540 --> 00:47:40,360
- We've been cooking, yeah.

1170
00:47:40,360 --> 00:47:41,200
- Bull fucking shit.

1171
00:47:41,200 --> 00:47:42,040
- We've been cooking somebody else.

1172
00:47:42,040 --> 00:47:42,940
- You've been cooking and he's been eating.

1173
00:47:42,940 --> 00:47:45,420
We've been cooking some videos together.

1174
00:47:45,420 --> 00:47:46,260
He's fat.

1175
00:47:46,260 --> 00:47:47,080
- Fat guy.

1176
00:47:47,080 --> 00:47:48,720
- But he said I'm next up after him.

1177
00:47:48,720 --> 00:47:50,100
- Yeah, next up on his plate.

1178
00:47:50,100 --> 00:47:51,780
- Yeah, I'm just not gonna eat me.

1179
00:47:51,780 --> 00:47:54,900
When he dies, I'm gonna be the next Drewski.

1180
00:47:54,900 --> 00:47:55,740
- Really?

1181
00:47:55,740 --> 00:47:56,560
- Yeah, he said that.

1182
00:47:56,560 --> 00:47:58,340
- You could, I guess you are similar.

1183
00:47:58,340 --> 00:47:59,660
You're Drewski's protege?

1184
00:47:59,660 --> 00:48:00,740
- Yeah, I'm his apprentice.

1185
00:48:00,740 --> 00:48:01,580
- Holy fucking shit.

1186
00:48:01,580 --> 00:48:02,420
- Officially.

1187
00:48:02,420 --> 00:48:03,240
- Huh.

1188
00:48:03,240 --> 00:48:04,080
- Officially.

1189
00:48:04,080 --> 00:48:04,920
- What do you mean by that?

1190
00:48:04,920 --> 00:48:05,740
Remember that?

1191
00:48:05,740 --> 00:48:07,060
- Yeah, he's actually trained me doing that.

1192
00:48:07,060 --> 00:48:07,900
- Really?

1193
00:48:07,900 --> 00:48:09,340
- I can't debut it yet, no.

1194
00:48:09,340 --> 00:48:10,620
- Come on, give us a taste.

1195
00:48:10,620 --> 00:48:11,860
- I'll do this.

1196
00:48:11,860 --> 00:48:17,860
Yeah, that's all I can do. That's all I can do. It's a copyright thing, okay? It's an issue.

1197
00:48:17,860 --> 00:48:21,860
Where did Drewski get his start? Did he come out of Chicago? Pete Holmes?

1198
00:48:21,860 --> 00:48:24,860
Yeah, he's a Second City guy.

1199
00:48:24,860 --> 00:48:26,860
He's from that class?

1200
00:48:26,860 --> 00:48:28,860
He could be.

1201
00:48:28,860 --> 00:48:31,860
I don't know, man. Who knows?

1202
00:48:31,860 --> 00:48:37,860
That'd be so funny to be a guy that hates guys like Drewski, because it's like, "Well, they didn't do..."

1203
00:48:37,860 --> 00:48:40,860
- They did not cut their teeth at the Second City or the UCB.

1204
00:48:40,860 --> 00:48:42,060
(laughing)

1205
00:48:42,060 --> 00:48:44,820
It's like a comedy nerd about that.

1206
00:48:44,820 --> 00:48:46,660
- Yeah, Drewsky didn't, he didn't pay his dues ever.

1207
00:48:46,660 --> 00:48:50,900
- Yeah, they were only funny on like Instagram Live.

1208
00:48:50,900 --> 00:48:53,360
They don't know what it's like to be at an improv show.

1209
00:48:53,360 --> 00:48:54,620
- They're right, man.

1210
00:48:54,620 --> 00:48:55,460
- Yeah.

1211
00:48:55,460 --> 00:48:57,820
- They've never done Who's Line or on a cruise.

1212
00:48:57,820 --> 00:48:59,660
- We should do an improv show together.

1213
00:48:59,660 --> 00:49:01,460
- Yeah. - Yeah.

1214
00:49:01,460 --> 00:49:02,300
- You think we could?

1215
00:49:02,300 --> 00:49:03,500
- Yeah. - Just the three of us?

1216
00:49:03,500 --> 00:49:04,340
- Let's try it.

1217
00:49:04,340 --> 00:49:05,160
- Yeah.

1218
00:49:05,160 --> 00:49:07,260

- I can't say check please 'cause I'm the guy.

00:49:45,340 --> 00:49:46,940
Okay, we're starting a new scene now.

00:49:46,940 --> 00:49:47,780

00:49:47,780 --> 00:49:49,180

I'm in love with you too, baby,

1239
00:49:52,500 --> 00:49:54,900
but I can't love you because I hate you.

1240
00:49:54,900 --> 00:49:56,520
I hate you.

1241
00:49:56,520 --> 00:49:57,360
- Musical improv.

1242
00:49:57,360 --> 00:49:58,180
(laughing)

1243
00:49:58,180 --> 00:50:00,100
- Improv is so easy, man.

1244
00:50:00,100 --> 00:50:02,300
What are these fucking tall guys complaining about?

1245
00:50:02,300 --> 00:50:03,140
- And I'm Michael Jackson, hee hee.

1246
00:50:03,140 --> 00:50:06,380
- Why is everybody who does improv always big-tongued guy?

1247
00:50:06,380 --> 00:50:07,580
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

1248
00:50:07,580 --> 00:50:09,880
We're sorry, we step out to the audience.

1249
00:50:09,880 --> 00:50:11,540
We're sorry guys, we're gonna have to cancel

1250
00:50:11,540 --> 00:50:12,380
the show tonight.

1251
00:50:12,380 --> 00:50:13,740
Somebody made an inappropriate choice.

1252
00:50:13,740 --> 00:50:15,100
They decided to be Michael Jackson.

1253
00:50:15,100 --> 00:50:15,940
- Yes. - Hee hee!

1254
00:50:15,940 --> 00:50:17,060
- And they didn't specify which year.

1255
00:50:17,060 --> 00:50:19,140
- And they, despite knowing things that we know about him,

1256
00:50:19,140 --> 00:50:22,820
and they didn't, and it was a wrong choice and we're sorry,

1257
00:50:22,820 --> 00:50:24,320
and the theater will be shutting down.

1258
00:50:24,320 --> 00:50:27,540
- Yep, and also, our boss did,

1259
00:50:27,540 --> 00:50:30,100
I fingered 150 million women.

1260
00:50:30,100 --> 00:50:31,960
- He had a fingering machine that he invented

1261
00:50:31,960 --> 00:50:33,560
that looks like a Dr. Seuss drawing.

1262
00:50:33,560 --> 00:50:35,920
- Oh, here's something.

1263
00:50:35,920 --> 00:50:40,080
- Caleb and Drewski exercise together.

1264
00:50:40,080 --> 00:50:41,720
That's the random scenario.

1265
00:50:41,720 --> 00:50:44,720
All right, I'm Caleb, here's Drewski.

1266
00:50:44,720 --> 00:50:46,120
Go, just try it, Pat.

1267
00:50:46,120 --> 00:50:47,160
- Yeah, just be Drewski.

1268
00:50:47,160 --> 00:50:48,760
- All right.

1269
00:50:48,760 --> 00:50:49,840
Caleb, do you wanna start?

1270
00:50:49,840 --> 00:50:53,840
- I knew he was just gonna do white voice, man.

1271
00:50:53,840 --> 00:50:56,080
- It doesn't have to, it could be anybody named Drewski.

1272
00:50:56,080 --> 00:50:58,600
It doesn't have his last name on there.

1273
00:50:58,600 --> 00:51:00,520
- You better black out that voice right now.

1274
00:51:00,520 --> 00:51:02,780
(laughing)

1275
00:51:02,780 --> 00:51:07,000
- Black it up or I fucking walk, right now,

1276
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:10,520
'cause I'm being myself, and you're being Drewski.

1277
00:51:10,520 --> 00:51:11,600
- Okay, well I guess-- - Right now.

1278
00:51:11,600 --> 00:51:13,360
- I guess the scene has changed.

1279
00:51:13,360 --> 00:51:15,600
- Yep, and-- - Here, I guess--

1280
00:51:15,600 --> 00:51:19,480
- Patrick and Black Caleb at a company holiday party.

1281
00:51:19,480 --> 00:51:20,800
I have no problem with that.

1282
00:51:20,800 --> 00:51:21,640
- Okay.

1283
00:51:21,640 --> 00:51:26,520
I'm so fucking drunk as shit.

1284
00:51:26,520 --> 00:51:27,600
- Man, me too.

1285
00:51:27,600 --> 00:51:30,440
I'm not. - End scene.

1286
00:51:30,440 --> 00:51:33,280

1287
00:51:33,280 --> 00:51:33,880

- Yeah.

1300
00:52:00,040 --> 00:52:00,880
- It's fucked up.

1301
00:52:00,880 --> 00:52:01,700
- Do you think that there's--

1302
00:52:01,700 --> 00:52:03,320
- Write me a screenplay where a crazy character

1303
00:52:03,320 --> 00:52:04,600
goes into a restaurant.

1304
00:52:04,600 --> 00:52:06,640
They can write 500 of those per minute.

1305
00:52:06,640 --> 00:52:08,200
- There's definitely, that's a thing.

1306
00:52:08,200 --> 00:52:11,160
Like there's like an improv, an AI improv show, right?

- That is true.

1311
00:52:20,440 --> 00:52:21,280
- There's no way an AI can do that.

1312
00:52:21,280 --> 00:52:22,880
- An AI will never be able to do that.

1313
00:52:22,880 --> 00:52:24,580
- Professional improvisers, that's basically

1314
00:52:24,580 --> 00:52:25,960
their bread and butter.

1315
00:52:25,960 --> 00:52:26,800

You're gross like a pig.

1396
00:55:15,920 --> 00:55:18,320
walking by, just standing in the background filming.

1397
00:55:18,320 --> 00:55:19,160
(laughing)

1398
00:55:19,160 --> 00:55:20,000
Filming Patrick from the back.

1399
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:22,440
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm at my office,

1400
00:55:22,440 --> 00:55:24,620
my friends are making a video in a little bit

1401
00:55:24,620 --> 00:55:26,880
and she was like, "Oh, what do you do for work?"

1402
00:55:26,880 --> 00:55:29,080
- Oh, that's the worst, man.

1403
00:55:29,080 --> 00:55:31,080
- Explain to a doctor what you do for work.

1404
00:55:31,080 --> 00:55:32,880
- A medical professional, I have to be like,

1405
00:55:32,880 --> 00:55:36,280
"Yeah, I just do this podcast with my friends."

1406
00:55:36,280 --> 00:55:37,800
- Yeah.

1407
00:55:37,800 --> 00:55:40,320
I do the only thing with a higher fucking suicide rate

1408
00:55:40,320 --> 00:55:41,160
than you do.

1409
00:55:41,160 --> 00:55:42,400
(laughing)

1410
00:55:42,400 --> 00:55:43,840
It's really bad.

1411
00:55:43,840 --> 00:55:44,960
- My life sucks shit.

1412
00:55:44,960 --> 00:55:47,040
- Yeah, I just say I'm a famous performer.

1413

- A famous touring performer. - I'm a famous singer

1415
00:55:48,720 --> 00:55:49,560
and dancer.

1416
00:55:49,560 --> 00:55:50,380
- Yeah.

1417
00:55:50,380 --> 00:55:51,440
- But I haven't decided yet.

1418
00:55:51,440 --> 00:55:52,280
- Yeah.

1419
00:55:52,280 --> 00:55:57,080
When when comedian every every comedian is in therapy, you know what sucks about

1420
00:55:57,080 --> 00:56:02,680
Like as a professional comedian having a therapist is they're all in squiggle vision. That's true

1421
00:56:02,680 --> 00:56:12,920
I'm trying sitting there. I'm trying to like tell her my problem funny story. Yeah, it's like oh, yeah

1422
00:56:12,920 --> 00:56:16,640
The funniest thing happened to me, but it's you know, it's because of my anxiety and she's sitting there like this

1423
00:56:16,640 --> 00:56:20,560
It's all fucked up. It's like, you know, I know you're only doing that good

1424
00:56:20,560 --> 00:56:23,160
I know there's only two frames of you right now.

1425
00:56:23,160 --> 00:56:24,480
And I'm looking at her, I'm like,

1426
00:56:24,480 --> 00:56:26,680
you remind me a little of my soccer coach.

1427
00:56:26,680 --> 00:56:28,520
I don't know why, something about you.

1428
00:56:28,520 --> 00:56:30,720
The style you're drawn in.

1429
00:56:30,720 --> 00:56:33,840
- Yeah, something about this,

1430
00:56:33,840 --> 00:56:35,600
it's just reminding me of my childhood.

1431
00:56:35,600 --> 00:56:37,160
I don't know why.

1432
00:56:37,160 --> 00:56:38,440
This reminds me of a movie.

1433
00:56:38,440 --> 00:56:39,780
- Yeah, let me tell you about my childhood.

1434
00:56:39,780 --> 00:56:41,440
So basically I used to make movies with my friends,

1435
00:56:41,440 --> 00:56:42,960
my two friends.

1436
00:56:42,960 --> 00:56:44,280
One time we made a musical.

1437
00:56:44,280 --> 00:56:46,400
- Oh my God, and there was this kid named Fenton

1438
00:56:46,400 --> 00:56:48,040
and he sucked so bad.

1439
00:56:48,040 --> 00:56:48,880
- And my mom.

1441
00:56:50,360 --> 00:56:52,900

The first episode ever made.

1450
00:57:03,480 --> 00:57:04,640
- That's the best place to start.

1451
00:57:04,640 --> 00:57:05,480
- Yep.

1452
00:57:05,480 --> 00:57:06,300

- I'd like to pound her stone.

00:57:17,040 --> 00:57:19,560
- Brendan Small as the small character.

1460
00:57:19,560 --> 00:57:22,840
not like to pound Paula Poundstone. I don't remember who that is but it sounds

1461
00:57:22,840 --> 00:57:30,080
like a girl? Yeah. I think she's a woman who loves women.

1462
00:57:30,080 --> 00:57:36,640
Look up who that is. Unless she's got a husband. Paula Poundstone. She's a female

1463
00:57:36,640 --> 00:57:43,560
comedian. Oh man she's a fox. Yep I stand by it.

1464
00:57:43,560 --> 00:57:48,240
She's a humorist actually. Did you guys consider yourselves more comics,

1465
00:57:48,240 --> 00:57:52,680
comedians or humorists? I am maybe I'm a look at this picture I'm more of a

1466
00:57:52,680 --> 00:57:57,000
scroll back up she's given herself the bunny ears holy shit she's fine I would

1467
00:57:57,000 --> 00:58:00,880
definitely consider myself more of an artiste really yeah you're an artistic

1468
00:58:00,880 --> 00:58:05,400
one yeah artiste look at this photo of Paula Poundstone yeah she looks good man

1469
00:58:05,400 --> 00:58:16,320
she looks good yeah that's the mom from home movies yeah but yeah the I'm trying

1470
00:58:16,320 --> 00:58:20,280
to become a humorist. I don't want belly laughs anymore. I just want hmm.

1471
00:58:20,280 --> 00:58:24,920
Anymore. You've been getting so many belly laughs. I've been getting a few out of you today.

1472
00:58:24,920 --> 00:58:32,120
Yeah, if I can't lie. Stop it! Tickling is not... If someone was an amazing... Imagine being the tickling humorist.

1473
00:58:32,120 --> 00:58:38,620
Yeah, tickling humorist is a good title. If you went on stage... Wait, wait, ready, ready, ready. Stop it, stop it. Don't go hmm.

1474
00:58:38,620 --> 00:58:44,320
This is something... I'm being Al Franken right now. I usually can only... You are being Al Franken right now.

1475
00:58:44,320 --> 00:58:49,280
That is a lot more like Al Franken than you realize. Yeah. Yeah, touching me when I

1476
00:58:49,280 --> 00:58:57,340
don't want to be touched. Very Al Franken-esque. If somebody could go on stage and just

1477
00:58:57,340 --> 00:59:02,540
massively tickle an entire comedy club, do you think that that would work? I guess that's what

1478
00:59:02,540 --> 00:59:07,720
humorists do. Is that good? It's just a laugh that you don't want to have. When a

1479
00:59:07,720 --> 00:59:11,080
humorist? When a humorist goes up and they're telling me this fucking

1480
00:59:11,080 --> 00:59:15,960
story about like like their AP bio teacher or some bullshit or the TV show

1481
00:59:15,960 --> 00:59:23,200
AP bio yeah that is a that is a humorist show it really is yeah you're a favorite

1482
00:59:23,200 --> 00:59:29,080
humorists favorite show yeah I heard Mo Rocca gave that rave reviews really

1483
00:59:29,080 --> 00:59:33,280
that's a country the country nope he's gonna say the company famous is lucky

1484
00:59:33,280 --> 00:59:38,040

1485
00:59:38,040 --> 00:59:45,440
fashionable frames, loves his glasses, different colors, same shape though.

1486
00:59:45,440 --> 00:59:51,240
What are you on about? Mo Rocca, the humorist. I've never heard of Mo Rocca.

1487
00:59:51,240 --> 00:59:56,240
Mo Rocca was on I Love the 80s. I don't think I saw that one. You didn't see I Love the 80s.

1488
00:59:56,240 --> 01:00:01,920
I Love the 70s or 90s. I saw 90s. I used to watch I Love the 1920s. Yeah.

1489
01:00:01,920 --> 01:00:02,760
- Yeah.

1490
01:00:02,760 --> 01:00:03,600
- What was that about?

1491
01:00:03,600 --> 01:00:07,560
- It was like, the factories are churning out

1492
01:00:07,560 --> 01:00:08,400
- What?

1493
01:00:08,400 --> 01:00:09,220
- Products.

1494
01:00:09,220 --> 01:00:13,520
- Who can forget, who can forget the Charleston?

1495
01:00:13,520 --> 01:00:17,120
- Yeah, I actually used to watch, I love the 10,000 BCs.

1496
01:00:17,120 --> 01:00:17,960
- Yeah.

1497
01:00:17,960 --> 01:00:20,140
- And they'd be like, oot, doot, doot.

1498
01:00:20,140 --> 01:00:21,640
- Paul Shearer sitting there.

1499
01:00:21,640 --> 01:00:24,280
- Paul F. Tompkins, ooga booga, hoobo.

1500
01:00:24,280 --> 01:00:26,600
- And I said, oot booga.

1501
01:00:26,600 --> 01:00:28,760
(laughing)

1502
01:00:28,760 --> 01:00:30,600
- That fucking, that story about Weird Al

1503
01:00:30,600 --> 01:00:32,520
that Paul F. Tompkins tells you, you heard that one?

1504
01:00:32,520 --> 01:00:33,440
- No.

1505
01:00:33,440 --> 01:00:36,680
- I think I showed my ex that when we first started dating,

1506
01:00:36,680 --> 01:00:38,120
'cause I was like, "This is so funny."

1507
01:00:38,120 --> 01:00:39,960
- For some reason I left it as an ex over Weird Al.

1508
01:00:39,960 --> 01:00:41,920
- That story did not happen.

1509
01:00:41,920 --> 01:00:42,760
- What was the story?

1510
01:00:42,760 --> 01:00:44,480
- It's the one where he meets Weird Al.

1511
01:00:44,480 --> 01:00:45,320
- What does Weird Al say?

1512
01:00:45,320 --> 01:00:48,040
- And he's like, "And I said weird!"

1513
01:00:48,040 --> 01:00:50,600
He says it's like, he tells this story about like,

1514
01:00:50,600 --> 01:00:52,480
he thought that he knew Weird Al,

1515
01:00:52,480 --> 01:00:54,600
and then realized, "I don't know Weird Al at all."

1516
01:00:54,600 --> 01:00:57,000
And she was like, "Yeah, that did not happen, he's lying."

1517
01:00:57,000 --> 01:01:01,400
You're doing a pretty poor job of recounting PFT's story.

1518
01:01:01,400 --> 01:01:02,220
I know.

1519
01:01:02,220 --> 01:01:03,060
I'm gonna have to stick with PFT.

1520
01:01:03,060 --> 01:01:05,200
PFT, 'cause when I hear his story, I go, "Pft."

1521
01:01:05,200 --> 01:01:06,040
Yeah.

1522
01:01:06,040 --> 01:01:06,880
No way, that didn't happen.

1523
01:01:06,880 --> 01:01:08,000
Not me, I believe him.

1524
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:08,820
Yeah.

1525
01:01:08,820 --> 01:01:09,660
I believe in him.

1526
01:01:09,660 --> 01:01:10,500
You believe in him?

1527
01:01:10,500 --> 01:01:11,520
Yeah, I believe in him.

1528
01:01:11,520 --> 01:01:13,480
Maybe it's a surprise, "Pft," you know,

1529
01:01:13,480 --> 01:01:15,000
like kinda like what a humorist is going.

1530
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:18,440
Guys, I found this thing, I found this YouTube.

1531
01:01:18,440 --> 01:01:19,920
The gall.

1532
01:01:19,920 --> 01:01:21,120
I'm always looking for new YouTube.

1533
01:01:21,120 --> 01:01:22,760
I know we've been talking about this,

1534
01:01:22,760 --> 01:01:23,600
but I've ran out of YouTube videos.

1535
01:01:23,600 --> 01:01:24,840
Sorry, I just had an idea.

1536
01:01:24,840 --> 01:01:25,680
Oh, you did?

1537
01:01:25,680 --> 01:01:26,500
I just had a remembrance.

1538
01:01:26,500 --> 01:01:27,980
- I found this YouTube channel,

1539
01:01:27,980 --> 01:01:29,460
the funniest shit I've ever heard.

1540
01:01:29,460 --> 01:01:31,740
It's called The Funny Channel.

1541
01:01:31,740 --> 01:01:32,580
- Oh wow. - Right?

1542
01:01:32,580 --> 01:01:33,400
And I know you're thinking,

1543
01:01:33,400 --> 01:01:35,140
"Wait, that's gotta be the worst name

1544
01:01:35,140 --> 01:01:36,660
"I've ever seen in my life."

1545
01:01:36,660 --> 01:01:38,420
- Put this on screen, wait, put this on screen.

1546
01:01:38,420 --> 01:01:39,860
Go back to the top and put this on screen.

1547
01:01:39,860 --> 01:01:41,500
- See, so it's one of these.

1548
01:01:41,500 --> 01:01:43,500
So if you search The Funny Channel.

1549
01:01:43,500 --> 01:01:45,060
- It will come up, it's gonna--

1550
01:01:45,060 --> 01:01:46,500
- It'll come up eventually.

1551
01:01:46,500 --> 01:01:47,340
- They've been clipping us here.

1552
01:01:47,340 --> 01:01:50,260

1553
01:01:50,260 --> 01:01:51,220

01:01:56,480 --> 01:01:57,680

01:02:11,080 --> 01:02:11,680

1565
01:02:11,680 --> 01:02:13,580

There's a lot of clips from here.

1572
01:02:26,720 --> 01:02:28,680
So if you watch one of these, if you--

1573
01:02:28,680 --> 01:02:29,520
- Who's this?

1574
01:02:29,520 --> 01:02:31,520
- If you've listened to one of these episodes

1575
01:02:31,520 --> 01:02:33,120
and you said, "Man, that was funny,

1576
01:02:33,120 --> 01:02:35,400
"but I can't remember a fucking goddamn thing

1577
01:02:35,400 --> 01:02:36,560
"that happened in that episode."

1578
01:02:36,560 --> 01:02:37,840
- And I wanna send my friend a clip.

1579
01:02:37,840 --> 01:02:39,280
- And I need to send my friend a clip.

1580
01:02:39,280 --> 01:02:41,240
Oh, that clip was so funny.

1581
01:02:41,240 --> 01:02:43,320
- Oh, and some longer form clips too.

1582
01:02:43,320 --> 01:02:44,560
Beyond shorts.

1583
01:02:44,560 --> 01:02:46,480
- Pal's old YouTube sketches.

1584
01:02:46,480 --> 01:02:48,360
Nicki Minaj boingus challenge.

1585
01:02:48,360 --> 01:02:51,120
- And I don't even know who these people are in the video.

1586
01:02:51,120 --> 01:02:53,320
- They seem very, very smart though.

1587
01:02:53,320 --> 01:02:55,420
That guy in the middle looks hungover.

1588
01:02:55,420 --> 01:03:00,120
Yeah, and the guy on the right looks like he has some kind of autoimmune disorder.

1589
01:03:00,120 --> 01:03:02,120
What's wrong with this yellow guy's cheek?

1590
01:03:02,120 --> 01:03:04,120
Wait, this guy's cheeks are yellow.

1591
01:03:04,120 --> 01:03:06,120
His cheek is kind of swollen.

1592
01:03:06,120 --> 01:03:08,120
His cheek is swollen as fuck AF.

1593
01:03:08,120 --> 01:03:13,820
It looks like to me, like, the Funny Channel is a great channel, but it's sorely in need of more likes, comments, views, and sharing to friends.

1594
01:03:13,820 --> 01:03:21,820
I agree. So if you like funny humor, go on to the Funny Channel 2646, give them a complete follow.

Bow.

1598
01:03:51,300 --> 01:03:52,300
Okay.

1599
