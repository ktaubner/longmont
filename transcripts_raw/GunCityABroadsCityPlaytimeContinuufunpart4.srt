1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Here we go.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Last time on Gun City, a broad city, Playtime continue fun.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,280
The guys beat the crap out of a snake, but not before making its heart grow three sizes

4
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:17,200
with the ever lovely threat of suicide from Patrick Yoda.

5
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:22,920
The snake, confused, let Patrick go take care of the half leprechaun O'Neil, whose throat

6
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:29,720
had been slashed by Playtime, the ever rampant serial killer, the ever rampant.

7
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:33,300
who tried to get his third kill in the same day.

8
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:35,480
However, playtime failed,

9
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:38,260
and Patrick Yoda staunched the bleeding.

10
00:00:38,260 --> 00:00:41,900
After Blotoss and Rey finished off the snake,

11
00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:44,340
they took its corpse and went on a shopping spree

12
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:46,460
where they found nothing they could afford.

13
00:00:46,460 --> 00:00:48,620
Then Blotoss and Rey took the snake back up

14
00:00:48,620 --> 00:00:50,980
to the crime lab for further investigation.

15
00:00:50,980 --> 00:00:55,340
While Patrick Yoda met up with Baby Gadd,

16
00:00:55,340 --> 00:00:58,080
who urged Patrick Yoda to keep the whole playtime attack

17
00:00:58,080 --> 00:00:59,460
on the down low,

18
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:02,460
that there'd be something in it for him if he did.

19
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:08,540
Patrick skipped most of the dialogue in the scene and went right to Gaddy up.

20
00:01:08,540 --> 00:01:11,540
I didn't.

21
00:01:11,540 --> 00:01:20,260
BG's chintzy Gadsville-themed bar in the undercity on the Pleasure Palace space station.

22
00:01:20,260 --> 00:01:24,980
The erstwhile cyberpunk aesthetics of Old Gun City reared its head there, and Patrick

23
00:01:24,980 --> 00:01:32,900
Gyora almost felt at home until he saw a very intimidating huge ass twins named Keep Calm

24
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:35,180
and Chive On.

25
00:01:35,180 --> 00:01:40,180
Patrick set to work reading their minds, whatever was in there, and found some very useful information

26
00:01:40,180 --> 00:01:42,500
that I'll recap in a moment.

27
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:46,220
But the sleuths up at the crime lab found their own strangeness.

28
00:01:46,220 --> 00:01:53,460
This snake, the second of two monsters that have appeared today, was made of organic matter,

29
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:58,820
plastic that is in toys, polyethylene, and some kind of synthetic composition that made

30
00:01:58,820 --> 00:02:01,020
up its erogenous zones.

31
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:03,020
and we learned it was scary to fight it.

32
00:02:03,020 --> 00:02:03,860
- Yes, and scannable.

33
00:02:03,860 --> 00:02:06,780
- And we learned that we were brave for defeating it.

34
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:09,020
- I'll also remind you guys a couple

35
00:02:09,020 --> 00:02:10,260
of little housekeeping things.

36
00:02:10,260 --> 00:02:12,940
It is probably afternoon-ish right now.

37
00:02:12,940 --> 00:02:15,020
You guys probably got started today,

38
00:02:15,020 --> 00:02:17,700
like at like 11-ish, maybe got to--

39
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:20,140
- We've already done all this shit and it's afternoon?

40
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:22,580
- It's probably afternoon, maybe early evening.

41
00:02:22,580 --> 00:02:24,340
Might be 5 p.m. maybe.

42
00:02:24,340 --> 00:02:27,460
- Well now I'm not, I was so scared when O'Neal got killed,

43
00:02:27,460 --> 00:02:29,460
but now I'm not scared at all, it was in broad daylight.

44
00:02:29,460 --> 00:02:30,300
- We were booking it.

45
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:33,100
It was like 5pm-ish, I mean the Undercity is pretty dark.

46
00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:37,400
I've just been assuming that every single day that we've played this has been a different day.

47
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:39,400
I've been assuming that this is real-world time.

48
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:41,400
Yeah, I guess there's no daylight, it is...

49
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:43,400
The daylight is like, I mean there's like, yeah, the...

50
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:45,400
Yeah, the artificial day?

51
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:48,400
Yes, but it depends on where you are in the space station.

52
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:50,400
They didn't invest in the Undercity.

53
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:53,400
The Undercity not as much, that was, you know, wasn't the Undercity yet, but...

54
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:53,900
I see.

55
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:55,900
...kind of made it a little bit more like that.

56
00:02:55,900 --> 00:02:59,900
And where O'Neil is kind of right on the border, so it's kind of like dusky at best there.

57
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:01,900
Daylight's been scared out of us.

58
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:03,900
It's been scared out of here as well.

59
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:05,900
Just turn the lights on and off.

60
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:07,900
Holy shit.

61
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:09,900
As soon as I said that,

62
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:11,900
that was insane timing.

63
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:13,900
Can you do that?

64
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:15,900
Do that again.

65
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:17,900
Holy shit.

66
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:19,900
Alright, don't do that. That's too scary.

67
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:21,900
Wow. Okay.

68
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:23,900
That was crazy.

69
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:25,900
That was insane time sync up.

70
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:27,900
Right there.

71
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:30,620
So you guys have been traveling around.

72
00:03:30,620 --> 00:03:31,460
- What a coincidence.

73
00:03:31,460 --> 00:03:32,300
- Did he do that on purpose?

74
00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:33,140
- Well, they both turned off at the same time.

75
00:03:33,140 --> 00:03:34,140
- Did he do that on purpose?

76
00:03:34,140 --> 00:03:35,300
- I don't know.

77
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:36,140
- What?

78
00:03:36,140 --> 00:03:37,740
- No, when I said scared the daylights out of us,

79
00:03:37,740 --> 00:03:39,900
the lights shut off immediately.

80
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:41,860
- Yes, I agree.

81
00:03:41,860 --> 00:03:42,820
That is pretty cool.

82
00:03:42,820 --> 00:03:43,740
- That was weird.

83
00:03:43,740 --> 00:03:47,460
- I think there's a ghost in the office, you guys.

84
00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:48,820
- So you guys have been traveling around,

85
00:03:48,820 --> 00:03:51,620
going to a crime lab, you know,

86
00:03:51,620 --> 00:03:53,460
and you've been taking the zippy loop for the most part.

87
00:03:53,460 --> 00:03:55,980
You lost a little bit of time going the cool way,

88
00:03:55,980 --> 00:03:57,860
but not that much time, like lost time.

89
00:03:57,860 --> 00:03:58,980
It just took a little bit longer.

90
00:03:58,980 --> 00:04:01,700
So it's like probably 5 p.m. ish now, I would say.

91
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:05,020
Like, so I guess like kind of end of day for a lot of folks.

92
00:04:05,020 --> 00:04:11,180
And for you, I'll give you some recap

93
00:04:11,180 --> 00:04:12,900
on what you heard from Yoda's mind.

94
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:15,380
And then I'll set the scene for where we are.

95
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:16,880
'Cause right now you got the parties like split,

96
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:17,720
I guess, right now.

97
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:20,180
So here's what you had learned.

98
00:04:20,180 --> 00:04:22,980
- Oh, it ended with, last episode ended with the--

99
00:04:22,980 --> 00:04:23,820
- With an imagined scenario.

100
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:25,660
- With an imagined scenario where I get murdered.

101
00:04:25,660 --> 00:04:27,740
- Yeah, get murdered.

102
00:04:27,740 --> 00:04:29,740
Yeah, that was cool.

103
00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:39,240
So, here's kind of what you learned that those twins, so like, are pissed at Gadd for, and as you dug deeper,

104
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:43,740
failing to kick up like a certain amount of tokens, it sounds like, over time.

105
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:45,240
And wanted to talk with him about that.

106
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:49,740
They also wanted to talk with him about the playtime situation, make sure it was under control,

107
00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:53,240
because it happened to one of Gadd's guys, that being O'Neal.

108
00:04:54,740 --> 00:04:57,540
as far as how it relates to you, they're wary of you,

109
00:04:57,540 --> 00:04:59,700
in particular, like you three.

110
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:01,380
Like, you know, you're not, at this point,

111
00:05:01,380 --> 00:05:03,420
you guys are kind of gun city celebrities, right?

112
00:05:03,420 --> 00:05:05,420
Like you've-- - We don't mean that.

113
00:05:05,420 --> 00:05:07,180
- That's right. - Oh, I mean that.

114
00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:08,020
(imitates gun firing)

115
00:05:08,020 --> 00:05:11,180
Yeah. - You open hot beer

116
00:05:11,180 --> 00:05:12,940
and cold dogs. - We did a hot soda.

117
00:05:12,940 --> 00:05:14,980
- You were entrepreneurs, you murdered

118
00:05:14,980 --> 00:05:16,580
the most powerful man in the city.

119
00:05:16,580 --> 00:05:19,220
- Oh yeah. - You went to jail.

120
00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:20,780
- That usually makes people famous.

121
00:05:20,780 --> 00:05:21,700
- Yeah. - Going to jail.

122
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:22,860
- Yeah, what about that model guy?

123
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:24,700
- Oh, for sure. - Remember that guy?

124
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:29,700
Which Marl guy? The guy who had the sexiest mugshot meme.

125
00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:36,700
Seems like you remember him a little more. I wonder why. He left his long time girlfriend.

126
00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:43,700
And you looked that up too. You looked up does he have a girlfriend. You have not learned how to roll a single die in this game.

127
00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:49,700
But you have made space for that hot guys love life. You don't remember that? No!

128
00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:53,380
Sorry 2014 lay off. He's got a fucking

129
00:05:53,380 --> 00:06:01,820
I'm sorry. You're right. I'm being ableist I guess um so but also we are a list cuz we're a list celebs in the gun

130
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:11,580
Guys are you're more like notorious like some people like notorious be yo, motherfucker. Yo, motherfucker. Yo, so ultimately

131
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:15,020
They have big ultimate ultimate Denzel Curry

132
00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:19,220
They have big murals of us on the streets.

133
00:06:19,220 --> 00:06:21,900
You're like, is that Ray William Johnson?

134
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:25,140
That doesn't really look like him.

135
00:06:25,140 --> 00:06:27,060
Until you get up close, you're like, oh, yeah,

136
00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:27,940
I guess I can see it.

137
00:06:27,940 --> 00:06:29,820
I guess so.

138
00:06:29,820 --> 00:06:30,740
But ultimately--

139
00:06:30,740 --> 00:06:32,140
And they have rap snacks, but they're actually

140
00:06:32,140 --> 00:06:33,020
rock and rap snacks.

141
00:06:33,020 --> 00:06:36,780
Denzel Curry aside, they were most concerned about--

142
00:06:36,780 --> 00:06:39,340
because you went all the way deep and kind of

143
00:06:39,340 --> 00:06:41,860
into whatever can actually rattle around

144
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:44,900
their minds into their biggest concerns, which

145
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:47,340
was of some kind of scientist

146
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:51,620
that they wanna make sure that the activities

147
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:54,300
of that scientist who works for Hugh Jass-Fax

148
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:59,260
are not becoming a problem for the

149
00:06:59,260 --> 00:07:01,140
Hugh Jass-Fax's operation in the undercity.

150
00:07:01,140 --> 00:07:03,020
- I didn't get anything else out of their brains, right?

151
00:07:03,020 --> 00:07:04,060
- That was the deep, I mean--

152
00:07:04,060 --> 00:07:06,580
- Yeah, base level, I didn't know about their past

153
00:07:06,580 --> 00:07:07,420
or anything.

154
00:07:07,420 --> 00:07:09,860
- No, I mean, 'cause the mind reading thing

155
00:07:09,860 --> 00:07:12,260
is meant to get their concerns about things,

156
00:07:12,260 --> 00:07:14,060
so you can get snippets of them,

157
00:07:14,060 --> 00:07:14,900
but we talked about, we talked about--

158
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:16,500
- I can't get their anxieties.

159
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:17,340
- We talked about getting--

160
00:07:17,340 --> 00:07:19,220
- And play upon them. - Upgrading it potentially

161
00:07:19,220 --> 00:07:20,060
to-- - Oh, right, right, right.

162
00:07:20,060 --> 00:07:22,140
- Into visuals as well, which we'll talk about ways

163
00:07:22,140 --> 00:07:24,820
to upgrade that, but another time, not in this episode.

164
00:07:24,820 --> 00:07:28,980
But also, but all that said, like,

165
00:07:28,980 --> 00:07:31,500
I can say that with that kind of mind reading--

166
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:32,780
- What, I didn't do anything.

167
00:07:32,780 --> 00:07:33,740
- Ability. - Just let Pat just talk.

168
00:07:33,740 --> 00:07:34,580
- All right.

169
00:07:34,580 --> 00:07:38,100
- With that kind of mind reading, you've, come on.

170
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:39,540
You definitely get the sense of like,

171
00:07:39,540 --> 00:07:40,780
these guys are like--

172
00:07:40,780 --> 00:07:43,060
- They're both eating pussy. - Why are you stopping

173
00:07:43,060 --> 00:07:43,900
talking? - Yeah.

174
00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:47,380
These guys are like, they're not high up,

175
00:07:47,380 --> 00:07:48,780
but they're thugs, right?

176
00:07:48,780 --> 00:07:49,980
They're not meant to really--

177
00:07:49,980 --> 00:07:51,120
- Oh.

178
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:53,060
- Like, they're thugs for a gangster.

179
00:07:53,060 --> 00:07:53,900
- Hey.

180
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:56,140
(laughing)

181
00:07:56,140 --> 00:07:59,780
- They're thugs for a gangster?

182
00:07:59,780 --> 00:08:02,220
Okay, so they sound fucking badass and sick?

183
00:08:02,220 --> 00:08:03,780
- Yeah, I'm not just, all right.

184
00:08:03,780 --> 00:08:06,420
I'm not gonna interrogate what you just put into the air.

185
00:08:06,420 --> 00:08:07,780
- I'd like to recruit them.

186
00:08:07,780 --> 00:08:09,980
- I mean, they--

187
00:08:09,980 --> 00:08:10,800
- You're not in the room.

188
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:12,700
- So yeah, so that's everything you learned.

189
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:15,500
You're still in Gaddy Up.

190
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:18,700
Baby Gat is going to go talk with them now

191
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:21,580
'cause he told you, "Hey, I gotta talk with these guys.

192
00:08:21,580 --> 00:08:23,100
"I'll be right with you though."

193
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:25,460
And O'Neal is in there, he's ordering a drink.

194
00:08:25,460 --> 00:08:27,900
But you guys, we're gonna go to there where you guys are.

195
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:30,740
You're in the crime lab in the Royal District.

196
00:08:30,740 --> 00:08:31,580
- Yep.

197
00:08:31,580 --> 00:08:33,220
- So you just found out that this snake

198
00:08:33,220 --> 00:08:35,580
has like erogenous zones.

199
00:08:35,580 --> 00:08:38,620
The blue gopher told you that from his analysis.

200
00:08:38,620 --> 00:08:40,220
- I remember him.

201
00:08:40,220 --> 00:08:41,980
- Catch me every time.

202
00:08:41,980 --> 00:08:42,980
We put the him.

203
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:43,980
Yeah.

204
00:08:43,980 --> 00:08:44,980
Really like.

205
00:08:44,980 --> 00:08:45,980
No, put my guy over here.

206
00:08:45,980 --> 00:08:46,980
I really like that his name is the blue gopher.

207
00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:48,460
No, the blue gopher was in the right place.

208
00:08:48,460 --> 00:08:49,460
Yeah.

209
00:08:49,460 --> 00:08:50,460
Sorry about that.

210
00:08:50,460 --> 00:08:51,460
Yeah.

211
00:08:51,460 --> 00:08:52,460
So you fucked everything up.

212
00:08:52,460 --> 00:08:53,460
Uh huh.

213
00:08:53,460 --> 00:08:54,460
So he's here.

214
00:08:54,460 --> 00:08:55,460
And then Peppa.

215
00:08:55,460 --> 00:08:56,460
Ray.

216
00:08:56,460 --> 00:08:57,460
Ray William Johnson.

217
00:08:57,460 --> 00:08:58,460
Well, Peppa's my nickname for Ray William Johnson.

218
00:08:58,460 --> 00:08:59,460
Oh, okay.

219
00:08:59,460 --> 00:09:01,300
Oh, 'cause you're spicy like Peppa.

220
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:02,300
Yeah.

221
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:03,300
I like that, actually.

222
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:04,300
And you're a pig.

223
00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:08,220
And the blue gopher will say, like, to you guys.

224
00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:09,220
Hey, man.

225
00:09:09,220 --> 00:09:10,220
You're the whole hog.

226
00:09:10,220 --> 00:09:11,980
(laughing)

227
00:09:11,980 --> 00:09:14,000
- Yeah, I call you a pig 'cause you're the goat,

228
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,780
and that's another farm animal.

229
00:09:15,780 --> 00:09:17,420
So it's kind of like, I say Peppa Pig

230
00:09:17,420 --> 00:09:19,820
'cause you're like the spiciest goat.

231
00:09:19,820 --> 00:09:20,660
- Okay.

232
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:21,580
- I call you pork grind.

233
00:09:21,580 --> 00:09:22,420
- Yeah.

234
00:09:22,420 --> 00:09:24,180
- 'Cause I love to eat your skin.

235
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:25,940
- Spicy goat Jamaica vibes.

236
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:26,780
- Yeah.

237
00:09:26,780 --> 00:09:27,620
- Mm.

238
00:09:27,620 --> 00:09:28,900
- But you're not a jerk.

239
00:09:28,900 --> 00:09:30,340
- Oh shit, thank you.

240
00:09:30,340 --> 00:09:32,540
- And you're not chicken.

241
00:09:32,540 --> 00:09:34,600
- But when I see you, I don't say ackee.

242
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:37,620
Like salt fish and ackee.

243
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:39,820
- You're getting way done. - So the blue gopher

244
00:09:39,820 --> 00:09:42,740
chimes in and says to you guys,

245
00:09:42,740 --> 00:09:45,700
like, this material's really interesting.

246
00:09:45,700 --> 00:09:48,820
I don't know exactly the synthetic parts

247
00:09:48,820 --> 00:09:49,980
where the erogenous zones are.

248
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:52,300
I don't know anyone who could make something like this.

249
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:55,240
The composition is hard for me to even track with.

250
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:59,460
It's sort of making my instruments into just doorstoppers.

251
00:09:59,460 --> 00:10:01,460
Like, I can't even begin to decipher it.

252
00:10:01,460 --> 00:10:02,700
You can see he's like looking at it.

253
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:05,220
It's like, it's kind of unknown what the composition is.

254
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:07,420
It's like, maybe it's techno slime,

255
00:10:07,420 --> 00:10:11,660
maybe it's like a some sort of like other kind of material just of the erogenous

256
00:10:11,660 --> 00:10:15,820
feel good if I put my doodle in the erogenous zone of the snake that's a good

257
00:10:15,820 --> 00:10:20,460
question you could certainly try I yeah but you're doodling roll a constitution

258
00:10:20,460 --> 00:10:28,820
saving throw wait would it feel good for who so it's a mouth and then that secret

259
00:10:28,820 --> 00:10:32,540
hole in the bottom I'll try both one by one okay let's start with the mouth roll

260
00:10:32,540 --> 00:10:34,100
or not

261
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:37,140
that's a net twenty

262
00:10:37,140 --> 00:10:39,020
and you know what

263
00:10:39,020 --> 00:10:42,300
your day you'd you had twenty put it here

264
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:46,300
here you do the full like the angelo how does it feel

265
00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:48,580
it

266
00:10:48,580 --> 00:10:50,460
galatani

267
00:10:50,460 --> 00:10:53,380
menu for the same

268
00:10:53,380 --> 00:10:57,220
i'm not for the status quo the reason i was one of my cameras out there for that

269
00:10:57,220 --> 00:11:01,460
music videos cuz he's fucking is that he had a hard-hitter

270
00:11:01,460 --> 00:11:06,580
I do want to clarify that one in one out. Yeah, so yeah, no berms one pump no spurting sperm

271
00:11:06,580 --> 00:11:10,300
What if you don't so good you should have you are a complete control

272
00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:17,860
Yes, I'm gonna tell you it feels amazing and you are

273
00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:22,900
You are as it feel though. You are in complete control of whether or not you come

274
00:11:22,900 --> 00:11:28,460
You have like a control that no one's ever had. Can you describe exactly how it feels? No

275
00:11:28,460 --> 00:11:30,960
- Okay, I pull out and then I go...

276
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:33,200
(laughing)

277
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:37,360
I go, "Ah, ah!"

278
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:41,140
- What the fuck is that?

279
00:11:41,140 --> 00:11:41,980
I've never seen cum.

280
00:11:41,980 --> 00:11:44,460
- That's something from inside the snake.

281
00:11:44,460 --> 00:11:45,300
- Oh man.

282
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:46,140
- It attacked me.

283
00:11:46,140 --> 00:11:46,960
- He's having a seizure.

284
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:48,100
- The blue gopher goes and he's like,

285
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:50,180
"Oh, well let me put it inside his kill."

286
00:11:50,180 --> 00:11:51,340
- We need to analyze that.

287
00:11:51,340 --> 00:11:54,220
- He goes, "I'll analyze this later.

288
00:11:54,220 --> 00:11:55,980
"You gonna try the other hole now?"

289
00:11:55,980 --> 00:11:57,740
- Oh yeah, well he's analyzing it

290
00:11:57,740 --> 00:11:59,740
And I'm secretly trying the other hole.

291
00:11:59,740 --> 00:12:00,740
Okay, cool.

292
00:12:00,740 --> 00:12:01,740
Roll another constitution saving throw.

293
00:12:01,740 --> 00:12:02,740
With advantage.

294
00:12:02,740 --> 00:12:03,740
With advantage.

295
00:12:03,740 --> 00:12:05,340
Because you got 20 on the last one, so you know what this is about.

296
00:12:05,340 --> 00:12:06,340
Okay, that's a 4.

297
00:12:06,340 --> 00:12:08,460
Well, this could be a whole different kind of feeling.

298
00:12:08,460 --> 00:12:09,460
And that's an 8.

299
00:12:09,460 --> 00:12:10,460
Plus 1.

300
00:12:10,460 --> 00:12:11,460
That's a 9.

301
00:12:11,460 --> 00:12:12,460
Yeah, you come inside the snake's hole.

302
00:12:12,460 --> 00:12:13,460
Right away.

303
00:12:13,460 --> 00:12:14,460
Pretty much instantly.

304
00:12:14,460 --> 00:12:23,460
Doc, I think there's more stuff to be in this other hole.

305
00:12:23,460 --> 00:12:24,460
No!

306
00:12:24,460 --> 00:12:27,580
I staple it shut.

307
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:32,920
unplugged something. I remember that being Staples there. He's like trying to analyze

308
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:36,900
it more closely. He says, "Well either way, what was it from your experiments? What

309
00:12:36,900 --> 00:12:45,740
was the synthetic material like?" I'm smoking a cigarette. I can tell you that it felt

310
00:12:45,740 --> 00:12:53,340
like good in like an otherworldly way. So I'm smoking a cigarette, I go, "Phew, that felt good."

311
00:12:53,340 --> 00:13:00,180
interesting okay that help us at all there's a tear down your gopher that a

312
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:06,460
huge scientific breakthrough pussy and fucking butthole feels good but as I'm

313
00:13:06,460 --> 00:13:12,820
my shirt up I'm rubbing my belly but as good as it made you feel that's where

314
00:13:12,820 --> 00:13:19,740
it's curious it's something hold on and the blue gopher takes on its hands

315
00:13:19,740 --> 00:13:21,740
running a train on a dead stage.

316
00:13:21,740 --> 00:13:23,980
(laughing)

317
00:13:23,980 --> 00:13:27,540
- I don't think, I think there's a one time

318
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:29,380
I think I'm gonna not partake.

319
00:13:29,380 --> 00:13:32,420
- Yeah, and yeah, yeah, the blue gopher's eyes

320
00:13:32,420 --> 00:13:33,880
like permanently cross.

321
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:36,660
(laughing)

322
00:13:36,660 --> 00:13:38,380
He's like, I think I can still see.

323
00:13:38,380 --> 00:13:40,420
Yes, that is not human.

324
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:42,880
That is not a creature that should,

325
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:46,580
that's not, thank you, bless you.

326
00:13:46,580 --> 00:13:48,940
- It's a being made completely out of pleasure.

327
00:13:48,940 --> 00:13:53,940
Hey Pleasure Man, am I still on the phone with him?

328
00:13:53,940 --> 00:13:55,940
Yeah, you can call them. You guys can call each other.

329
00:13:55,940 --> 00:13:59,940
Yeah, I don't, because I remember I called him last time, but I don't remember if I'm still on the phone.

330
00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:03,940
Yeah, you just hear like, you haven't been saying anything, you hear from speaker, like a speaker phone.

331
00:14:03,940 --> 00:14:06,940
Like a being made completely out of pleasure?

332
00:14:06,940 --> 00:14:10,940
Yes, something like that.

333
00:14:10,940 --> 00:14:13,940
A Pleasure Man?

334
00:14:13,940 --> 00:14:22,460
there's only one sorry my computer made that sound the test results are in

335
00:14:22,460 --> 00:14:28,500
I actually literally I'm only 90% who so I do need to just one second look like a

336

00:15:16,260 --> 00:15:17,920
The kind that's only the crisp.

347
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:18,860
- Yep.

348
00:15:18,860 --> 00:15:21,060
- Yeah, those are actually some of the best fries.

349
00:15:21,060 --> 00:15:24,120
- You think his is some of the best penis you ever had?

350
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:26,660
I'm reading between the lines here.

351
00:15:26,660 --> 00:15:30,660
- The only scientist I could think of on the ship

352
00:15:30,660 --> 00:15:32,500
who would even know where to begin

353
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:34,380
in analyzing something like this.

354
00:15:34,380 --> 00:15:37,140
- Probably some fucking ho-ass scientist.

355
00:15:37,140 --> 00:15:38,380
(laughing)

356
00:15:38,380 --> 00:15:40,980
- Doctor might be, I think he's about to say Dr. Slut.

357
00:15:40,980 --> 00:15:42,780
- Yeah, Dr. Mike Lit.

358
00:15:42,780 --> 00:15:44,980
- Well, no, I don't think so.

359
00:15:44,980 --> 00:15:47,580
Mike Lit, he died very recently.

360
00:15:47,580 --> 00:15:48,620
- Or Mike Hunt.

361
00:15:48,620 --> 00:15:51,340
- Yeah, or Mike, well, that's a little nastier.

362
00:15:51,340 --> 00:15:52,420
(laughing)

363
00:15:52,420 --> 00:15:53,260
R-rated.

364
00:15:53,260 --> 00:15:54,500
- Okay, wait, Mike Hock.

365
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:56,180
- Yeah, Mike Hock might be.

366
00:15:56,180 --> 00:15:59,420
- Well, it would be Ebenezer Keech.

367
00:15:59,420 --> 00:16:01,580
(laughing)

368
00:16:01,580 --> 00:16:02,980
- Okay.

369
00:16:02,980 --> 00:16:05,220
- Dr. Ebenezer Keech.

370
00:16:05,220 --> 00:16:08,040
Him and Tool Lateralis were the only,

371
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:12,320
only ever doctors to work for the Techno Slime Corporation,

372
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:15,480
Papa Chuka Techno Slime Corporation, and Get Out.

373
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:17,200
But, and he works here now.

374
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:19,700
- Ebeneezer Queef.

375
00:16:19,700 --> 00:16:22,620
- Oh, hey, that's not right to say.

376
00:16:22,620 --> 00:16:24,220
- Somebody shut that funny phone up.

377
00:16:24,220 --> 00:16:25,500
- From the pocket.

378
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:27,300
- If you go to the command center.

379
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:29,540
(laughing)

380
00:16:29,540 --> 00:16:33,460
- From the pocket.

381
00:16:33,460 --> 00:16:35,060
- From the pocket.

382
00:16:35,060 --> 00:16:38,860
I'm ripping shit up from the pocket.

383
00:16:38,860 --> 00:16:40,860
You can't even, I ain't even in the room.

384
00:16:40,860 --> 00:16:43,660
- You're just in the bar.

385
00:16:43,660 --> 00:16:45,360
You're in the bar, you're like in a corner,

386
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:48,060
like, "I'm gonna give a fuck, yeah."

387
00:16:48,060 --> 00:16:49,420
(laughing)

388
00:16:49,420 --> 00:16:50,260
- One ear closed.

389
00:16:50,260 --> 00:16:51,100
- Yeah.

390
00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:51,920
- Finger.

391
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:52,760
- Yeah, dude.

392
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:55,300
- I'm tearing that up from the pocket, though.

393
00:16:55,300 --> 00:16:56,140
Sorry, excuse me.

394
00:16:56,140 --> 00:16:57,920
They're moving over as some people move in

395
00:16:57,920 --> 00:16:58,760
with their friends.

396
00:16:58,760 --> 00:17:00,100
- I wanna close my tab.

397
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:01,540
Oh, snap!

398
00:17:01,540 --> 00:17:03,300
Here we come from the pocket.

399
00:17:04,540 --> 00:17:05,820
So you could--

400
00:17:05,820 --> 00:17:07,100
- And then doing the thing where you hold

401
00:17:07,100 --> 00:17:09,580
the phone speaker directly to your ear

402
00:17:09,580 --> 00:17:12,020
when you're playing a voice memo from someone in public.

403
00:17:12,020 --> 00:17:14,200
(laughing)

404
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:17,420
- So you could go to the command center and meet with him.

405
00:17:17,420 --> 00:17:19,560
That would be where he's located.

406
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:22,340
You'd have to go probably speak with Gumby Superior

407
00:17:22,340 --> 00:17:28,260
as he is his personal scientist and member of his crew.

408
00:17:28,260 --> 00:17:29,640
But at this point, I'm out.

409
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:31,180
I mean, you'll keep bringing me monsters.

410
00:17:31,180 --> 00:17:33,860
I'll keep fucking them and learning more.

411
00:17:33,860 --> 00:17:35,860
I wasn't even a character.

412
00:17:35,860 --> 00:17:37,860
You guys made me up basically.

413
00:17:37,860 --> 00:17:39,860
Oh yeah.

414
00:17:39,860 --> 00:17:41,860
The blue coat fur is now a guy.

415
00:17:41,860 --> 00:17:43,860
So now I think that...

416
00:17:43,860 --> 00:17:45,860
And he works at a crime lab.

417
00:17:45,860 --> 00:17:47,860
And fucks dead animals.

418
00:17:47,860 --> 00:17:49,860
The guy who fucks the dead animals to analyze them.

419
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:51,860
Well this is the first one that he fucked right?

420
00:17:51,860 --> 00:17:53,860
Which is now he has a taste for it.

421
00:17:53,860 --> 00:17:55,860
Yeah.

422
00:17:55,860 --> 00:17:57,860
Let's see. He rolled an 8.

423
00:17:57,860 --> 00:17:59,860
He fucked 8 before that?

424
00:17:59,860 --> 00:18:01,860
I don't know what that means.

425
00:18:01,860 --> 00:18:03,860
I'll be honest

426
00:18:03,860 --> 00:18:12,300
Way to find that out, but yeah, so you guys can either we'll go back to the bar though

427
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:18,140
Let's just I guess get some people there, but um

428
00:18:18,140 --> 00:18:21,740
Baby gets here now

429
00:18:21,740 --> 00:18:26,260
Yeah, baby get baby. Well, baby guys in like a back room with the two with keep coming Chyba unless

430
00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:30,800
Unless you I mean Patrick Yoda, did you as baby guy went?

431
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:35,080
He just went away with them. You didn't care at that point or like, um, you I mean

432
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:38,900
I was just asking if you like talk to them at all or talk to baby guy before you went away with them

433
00:18:38,900 --> 00:18:44,180
I did so you just had read their minds right after baby. God. Oh, yeah. Yeah, then they went into that room, right? Yeah

434
00:18:44,180 --> 00:18:44,880
Yeah, that's fine

435
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:48,140
I want to see if you if you wanted to engage with them at all cuz you were gonna hit them

436
00:18:48,140 --> 00:18:50,140
I'm gonna I'm gonna try

437
00:18:50,140 --> 00:18:53,920
Is there I don't have any kind of eavesdropping technology

438
00:18:54,420 --> 00:18:57,460
Not technology, but you big ears big-ass ears. Yeah, I

439
00:18:57,460 --> 00:18:59,940
literally think

440
00:18:59,940 --> 00:19:06,820
We'd almost do that. I know that's a I I literally think there is precedent for yeah you using your big ears

441
00:19:06,820 --> 00:19:09,820
Okay, then I'm gonna put my very open to that

442
00:19:09,820 --> 00:19:15,860
Okay, wait should I climb is there a I'm gonna roll an investigation real quick. What are you gonna?

443
00:19:15,860 --> 00:19:19,660
Do what are you I'm looking for a way to eavesdrop more on their conversation?

444
00:19:19,660 --> 00:19:21,340
Yeah, so I'll also before you enroll

445
00:19:21,340 --> 00:19:26,260
I'll give you a layout of just like there's like the bar and then like a back room that's to the side of the bar

446
00:19:26,260 --> 00:19:36,840
It's actually it actually just teleport you to the back room and makes you invisible when you're there, but no yeah roll this

447
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:41,820
Because I feel like rolling my ear up to the door would be too too conspicuous

448
00:19:41,820 --> 00:19:44,720
Yeah, yeah roll roll to see if you can find a better way to do this

449
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:48,960
Okay, and then also you can describe to me. I got a nine wait wait nine

450
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:52,420
- Nine plus, so that's 11.

451
00:19:52,420 --> 00:19:54,080
- 11, so it's not bad.

452
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:58,160
I mean, there's nothing, you have a better way of,

453
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:00,680
like you can see kind of where the crease in the door is,

454
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:02,000
it's on the bottom, which isn't that helpful,

455
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,920
but you didn't get too much about the layout

456
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:05,040
that can help you.

457
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:07,360
That said, I mean, describe to me

458
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:08,560
how you're gonna try to listen to them

459
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:10,260
to make this less conspicuous.

460
00:20:10,260 --> 00:20:12,400
There are other people at the bar, but--

461
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:14,200
- They're in a secret room?

462
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:16,280
- They're just in his office, in the back room.

463
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:17,120
It's not like a--

464
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:22,880
Can you describe what's around the office? Is it one of those bars that it's just a door

465
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:29,560
that says "employees only" or is it fully in the back? Does it say "Gastropub"?

466
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:32,980
What you know is that there's an "employees only" - it doesn't say "Gastropub" - only

467
00:20:32,980 --> 00:20:33,980
door.

468
00:20:33,980 --> 00:20:36,500
There's a door that says "Gastropub" though.

469
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:41,400
In that - through there. No, but what you don't know is that if there's further down

470
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:43,880
the hall than his office.

471
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:47,480
know what I mean? Then I'm gonna put my ear up to the... is there a stool

472
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:52,880
next to this door? Yeah. I'm gonna sit there in a way that is not

473
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:59,720
conspicuous, but if you were to look at me... Yeah, roll performance. If you were

474
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:02,920
to look at me, you'd be like, "This guy is clearly trying to listen to something."

475
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:11,200
Yeah, right. What'd you get? I got a six again. Or no, I got a six now. What'd you get

476
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:18,800
later. Oh, I know earlier I had another 11. Okay, oh your performance is pretty good.

477
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:24,560
Uh yeah, I would say you can do this for like enough time

478
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:29,760
that like you can get that you'd sense that you can't really hear much so

479
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:34,400
there's probably more space but you know that you can't do this for any kind of

480
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:38,640
longer than it is to know that before like a bartender will probably or like a

481
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:40,480
a bouncer will come over and be like, "Hey man, what's..."

482
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:41,560
- Is it the bouncer?

483
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:42,400
- What's happening?

484
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:43,220
- Yep.

485
00:21:43,220 --> 00:21:46,060
- Yeah, the bouncer's like, "Oh my God."

486
00:21:46,060 --> 00:21:46,900
- I don't want to sleep.

487
00:21:46,900 --> 00:21:48,260
- Oh my God, that's Cloud's body.

488
00:21:48,260 --> 00:21:50,520
(laughing)

489
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:52,360
- Oh my God, that is mostly Cloud.

490
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:53,560
- Yeah.

491
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:56,240
I feel like you're missing Cloud's hair for that piece.

492
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:57,080
- Shut up.

493
00:21:57,080 --> 00:22:01,640
- Okay, what else can I, can I just like sneak into that?

494
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:04,320
'Cause it's like clear that there's, all right.

495
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:05,160
- Yeah, so look at your--

496
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:08,160
- I'm going to assume the role of employee

497
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:11,960
using a disguise. Do I have a disguise kit?

498
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:15,360
We're bringing back disguises. You don't have a disguise kit.

499
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:18,720
The only one that you have is the arcade repairman outfit.

500
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:22,280
Let's go. You're going to try to do that again? Yes sir.

501
00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:26,000
Okay, so roll a disguise kit check

502
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:30,160
I guess. This is what would usually be for a disguise kit.

503
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:33,760
And you can still just put on the outfit.

504
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:36,840
Do I add anything? No, no, no.

505
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:39,880
No, he's got six. I mean, you don't you don't have the

506
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:42,840
the comportment of an arcade repairman for the most part.

507
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:45,780
But really, this is performance.

508
00:22:45,780 --> 00:22:47,320
So it's like 11 then, right?

509
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:50,820
Oh, yeah, you're you're you see, but you did kind of walk in here

510
00:22:50,820 --> 00:22:53,020
already as not an arcade repairman.

511
00:22:53,020 --> 00:22:57,060
So wait, wait, did you change before there or did you leave?

512
00:22:57,060 --> 00:23:00,960
OK, I or before I do this, I leave the bar and say, all right.

513
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:04,400
Is there an arcade machine in the bar?

514
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:05,640

520
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:22,640
And then I just walk out and then turn around.

521
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:27,640
It's like as fast as I left, I come back in, in the arcade.

524
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:35,000
Just to see if you can get away from people who are gonna not.

526
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:37,560

527
00:23:37,560 --> 00:23:39,560
You run around the corner.

528
00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:41,560
Bouncers are chasing you.

529
00:23:41,560 --> 00:23:42,840
[laughter]

530
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:44,840
They see your clothes

531
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:45,880

532
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:47,880

533
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:49,880

534
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:51,880
and then they see you come out wearing different clothes.

535
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:53,880
Also you're completely out of breath.

536
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:55,880
[panting]

537
00:23:55,880 --> 00:23:57,880

538
00:23:57,880 --> 00:23:59,880

540
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:06,440

That means my work speaks for itself.

545
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:19,880
That means I'm one of the best arcade repairmen this side of Gun City.

546
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:20,880
Look.

547
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:25,520

Why did they stand outside?

557

Our work here is done.

558
00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:59,160
No, they stand inside the bar to stop people from going out.

559
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:01,080

She's sauntering up. She sees you on the floor yelling and rolling around and

603
00:27:17,140 --> 00:27:20,740
She looks at you and she goes

604
00:27:20,740 --> 00:27:23,900
Who are you?

605
00:27:23,900 --> 00:27:26,020

00:28:02,460 --> 00:28:08,900
She's like all right. That's kind of weird. I didn't know you were gonna talk. Uh you're Patrick Yoda, right?

610
00:28:08,900 --> 00:28:10,900
No.

611
00:28:10,900 --> 00:28:12,900
Roll Deception.

612
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:14,900
Well he's dressed like the Arcade Repairman.

613
00:28:14,900 --> 00:28:16,900
That's true.

614
00:28:16,900 --> 00:28:18,900
So that's gotta be advantage.

615
00:28:18,900 --> 00:28:20,900
How does she even recognize him?

616
00:28:20,900 --> 00:28:22,900
He's a famous Yoda.

617
00:28:22,900 --> 00:28:24,900
Also, if we're famous,

618
00:28:24,900 --> 00:28:26,900
probably our Arcade Repairman thing is

619
00:28:26,900 --> 00:28:28,900
pretty well known at this point.

620
00:28:28,900 --> 00:28:30,900
Right?

621
00:28:30,900 --> 00:28:32,900
It's not.

622
00:28:32,900 --> 00:28:34,900
It's not not well known.

623
00:28:34,900 --> 00:28:36,900
That's how you get an Arcade Repairman costume, is you go into Spirit Halloween

624
00:28:36,900 --> 00:28:38,900
have a costume with our picture on it.

625
00:28:38,900 --> 00:28:42,900
At this point, Blotas has like an actual disguise ability.

626
00:28:42,900 --> 00:28:45,900
You need like a new get up.

627
00:28:45,900 --> 00:28:49,900
Because it used to be you two would go in together as Arcade Repairman.

628
00:28:49,900 --> 00:28:51,900
But he could like change his face and stuff.

629
00:28:51,900 --> 00:28:53,900
Those were the days.

630
00:28:53,900 --> 00:28:56,900
You just are still a Yoda just wearing an Arcade Repairman outfit.

631
00:28:56,900 --> 00:28:58,900
Which is not an outfit.

632
00:28:58,900 --> 00:29:00,900
At all. It's not like an outfit.

633
00:29:00,900 --> 00:29:02,900
Well you just made it one. You said wearing one.

634
00:29:02,900 --> 00:29:04,900
Yeah I did. I sure did.

635
00:29:04,900 --> 00:29:11,260
Yes, so she said no. She doesn't believe you. She goes like, "All right." And she like

636
00:29:11,260 --> 00:29:18,180
kind of looks back in the bar and she said, "Did those two big British guys, did

637
00:29:18,180 --> 00:29:24,620
they go back there?" Yes. All right. Give me one second. So she goes and walks

638
00:29:24,620 --> 00:29:31,820
through and goes... I follow her. Yeah. Like I'm floating towards her like a pie on a window. Yeah, I mean she's not even like

639
00:29:31,820 --> 00:29:36,380
paying much mind to that and she's going in and you see it is a

640
00:29:36,380 --> 00:29:40,700
bit of a longer hallway is probably why you were having trouble hearing and then

641
00:29:40,700 --> 00:29:47,620
you get to the door and she knocks on the door and you hear now kind of muffled

642
00:29:47,620 --> 00:29:53,020

645
00:30:02,420 --> 00:30:11,980

646
00:30:11,980 --> 00:30:15,980
that's enough dressing down the the baby who runs the bar you guys can go home

647
00:30:15,980 --> 00:30:20,260
now and they go yes miss and they kind of walk out and she goes over and she

648
00:30:20,260 --> 00:30:24,860
like starts like apologizing the baby dad and like daddy yada and they walk by

You're so much bigger than me

657
00:31:02,180 --> 00:31:03,540

the after the debate

668
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:25,260

677
00:31:38,580 --> 00:31:39,420
- They leave?

678
00:31:39,420 --> 00:31:40,500

00:32:09,900 --> 00:32:10,740
- What? - How did you know

690
00:32:10,740 --> 00:32:12,020
it is a reference? - How is anybody

691
00:32:12,020 --> 00:32:13,740
knowing anything anymore?

692
00:32:13,740 --> 00:32:18,740
So she goes, "Look, my associates can come off a little bit."

693
00:32:18,740 --> 00:32:23,100

694
00:32:23,100 --> 00:32:25,180
I don't care what he does.

695
00:32:25,180 --> 00:32:26,020
He's my good friend now.

696
00:32:26,020 --> 00:32:27,060
- I did see him give you uppies.

697
00:32:27,060 --> 00:32:28,340

698
00:32:28,340 --> 00:32:31,320
But, if you guys are ever interested

703
00:32:42,860 --> 00:32:44,860
to load up somebody's contact information.

704
00:32:44,860 --> 00:32:47,120

I'll do my best.

712
00:33:00,780 --> 00:33:05,140
And she lifts you up and gives you a piece for a second.

713
00:33:05,140 --> 00:33:06,620
She throws me into the ceiling.

714
00:33:06,620 --> 00:33:08,340
Yes, you're stuck in the ceiling.

715
00:33:08,340 --> 00:33:12,000

Do you have a guard?

908
00:42:00,500 --> 00:42:02,500
Do you actually have your pants down?

909
00:42:02,500 --> 00:42:03,500
No.

910
00:42:03,500 --> 00:42:06,940
No, we're doing theater of the mind with Baby Geth.

911
00:42:06,940 --> 00:42:07,940
They're really doing this.

912
00:42:07,940 --> 00:42:09,160
I know them.

913
00:42:09,160 --> 00:42:10,160
They're crazy.

914
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:12,060

920
00:42:31,580 --> 00:42:34,340

All of those things just please

925
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:52,000
How much how much we didn't say how much money was in the field to the brim with how much money you can get in?

926
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:56,740

927
00:42:56,740 --> 00:43:01,600

00:43:06,600 --> 00:43:11,540
You see after a while crocodile, okay, bye bye

930
00:43:12,340 --> 00:43:19,080
You see O'Neal and like O'Neal's been kind of like happy and like enjoying his time. Oh, and I want this guy to

931
00:43:19,080 --> 00:43:25,500
Fully healed mostly by you. What do you want though before? What does he want O'Neal? Yeah, I

932
00:43:25,500 --> 00:43:30,340
Want all I'd love to have a love to have a girlfriend

933
00:43:30,340 --> 00:43:34,380
That's sad

934
00:43:34,380 --> 00:43:39,700
So O'Neal I don't I will say to you I don't know if that's gonna happen

935
00:43:39,700 --> 00:43:44,980
happen tonight. This would also mean... You kind of look insane. This would also mean,

936
00:43:44,980 --> 00:43:50,240
by the way, because nobody's going to pick up on this, but he's not a childless couple.

937
00:43:50,240 --> 00:43:54,660
He's not a childless couple. So I will note that. He's not a what? Because that's who

938
00:43:54,660 --> 00:44:03,140
Playtime was killing. Childless couples. You're a genius. I wrote the story. Oh yeah. It was

939
00:44:03,140 --> 00:44:08,860
just figuring out how subtle to be with things, but like yeah. Yeah, well there's no way.

940
00:44:08,860 --> 00:44:10,820
- Yeah, yeah, I know. - Now, wait.

941
00:44:10,820 --> 00:44:12,440
If playtime was...

942
00:44:12,440 --> 00:44:17,780
This is supposed to mean something.

943
00:44:17,780 --> 00:44:20,580
(laughing)

944
00:44:20,580 --> 00:44:23,300
I'm supposed to be thinking about all this money

945
00:44:23,300 --> 00:44:24,420
I'm gonna get. - Perfect, perfect.

946
00:44:24,420 --> 00:44:25,460
We're cutting away.

947
00:44:25,460 --> 00:44:26,300
That is perfect.

948
00:44:26,300 --> 00:44:27,140
- He is an orphan.

949
00:44:27,140 --> 00:44:28,260
Playtime's an orphan.

950
00:44:28,260 --> 00:44:30,740
- You guys arrive at the command center.

951
00:44:30,740 --> 00:44:32,060
- Okay.

952
00:44:32,060 --> 00:44:33,260
- And you see right away--

953
00:44:33,260 --> 00:44:35,460
- Wait, where's the lodging gonna be?

954
00:44:35,460 --> 00:44:38,260
- It'll be like, it'll be probably either,

955
00:44:38,260 --> 00:44:39,140
I mean, you'll get your pick.

956
00:44:39,140 --> 00:44:40,380
You can either be--

957
00:44:40,380 --> 00:44:41,820
Oh, I'm going to get my pick.

958
00:44:41,820 --> 00:44:44,860
Well, because you can either live above Gaddyup.

959
00:44:44,860 --> 00:44:46,420
You can live above the bar.

960
00:44:46,420 --> 00:44:52,700
Or he has basically like section 8 housing in the undercity.

961
00:44:52,700 --> 00:44:54,780
I'm going to pick that.

962
00:44:54,780 --> 00:44:55,940
Kendrick Lamarvod.

963
00:44:55,940 --> 00:44:58,060
Yeah, Kendrick Lamarvod.

964
00:44:58,060 --> 00:44:58,940
For sure.

965
00:44:58,940 --> 00:44:59,980
I'm picking that.

966
00:44:59,980 --> 00:45:01,980
So the White House?

967
00:45:01,980 --> 00:45:02,500
Yeah.

968
00:45:02,500 --> 00:45:04,500
So you guys will-- but because of that,

969
00:45:04,500 --> 00:45:11,500
then it's it's the rent is gonna be like 100 tokens and we have a chest full of money.

970
00:45:11,500 --> 00:45:15,680
We have a chest full of money. Hey, we got a chest full of money that is gonna be...

971
00:45:15,680 --> 00:45:19,280
Brim levels of money. He's got to make something out of it but instead of

972
00:45:19,280 --> 00:45:23,320
paying 500 tokens and you're still getting a thousand a day from Belinda

973
00:45:23,320 --> 00:45:27,440
so you're gonna start seeing increases in your money this way. So that's

974
00:45:27,440 --> 00:45:31,600
that's a way to look at it so we'll keep that in mind as you're basically

975
00:45:31,600 --> 00:45:35,260
canceling your hotel stay at the 10 Seasons

976
00:45:35,260 --> 00:45:37,960
and moving into Section 8.

977
00:45:37,960 --> 00:45:39,600
It's a great move.

978
00:45:39,600 --> 00:45:40,440
We're frugal.

979
00:45:40,440 --> 00:45:43,080
Wait, we can't have two like GTA V?

980
00:45:43,080 --> 00:45:45,400
Like GTA V, you could have two if you'd like.

981
00:45:45,400 --> 00:45:46,040
We want two.

982
00:45:46,040 --> 00:45:46,440
But then you've got to pay twice.

983
00:45:46,440 --> 00:45:48,400
It's $500 a day and $100 a month, though.

984
00:45:48,400 --> 00:45:49,200
It's a safe house.

985
00:45:49,200 --> 00:45:50,240
So like--

986
00:45:50,240 --> 00:45:51,000
It's a safe house.

987
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:53,320
You don't have to pay him $100 a day for lodging.

988
00:45:53,320 --> 00:45:54,160
That's crazy.

989
00:45:54,160 --> 00:45:56,880
That's our new-- it's our new crash pad.

990
00:45:56,880 --> 00:45:58,320
You will be-- cut that to us.

991
00:45:58,320 --> 00:45:58,960
We want to do--

992
00:45:58,960 --> 00:46:00,480
So you guys are in-- then we'll work out the housing logic

993
00:46:00,480 --> 00:46:01,200
later.

994
00:46:01,200 --> 00:46:03,300
So you guys are, yeah, you guys arrive there

995
00:46:03,300 --> 00:46:05,220
and Gummi Superior is like waiting for you

996
00:46:05,220 --> 00:46:06,520
at the Zippy Loop stop.

997
00:46:06,520 --> 00:46:07,360
- Okay.

998
00:46:07,360 --> 00:46:09,140
- So, and he has his hands behind his back

999
00:46:09,140 --> 00:46:12,420
and he says like, "Oh, you gentlemen, it's good to see you."

1000
00:46:12,420 --> 00:46:13,660
- What is he, who's his character?

1001
00:46:13,660 --> 00:46:14,500
Can he be that?

1002
00:46:14,500 --> 00:46:17,140
- Gummi Superior is the, that's pretty funny.

1003
00:46:17,140 --> 00:46:19,100
But I think I had him as,

1004
00:46:19,100 --> 00:46:23,520
if I can't find a guy for him,

1005
00:46:23,520 --> 00:46:26,100
I think this was him, basically.

1006
00:46:26,100 --> 00:46:26,940
- Okay.

1007
00:46:26,940 --> 00:46:30,300
- "Well, gentlemen, it's good to see you.

1008
00:46:30,300 --> 00:46:37,700

And you see ebomb - right and it's just like gray gross kind of morass

1036
00:48:15,420 --> 00:48:18,340
That's perfect. I love that and

1037
00:48:18,340 --> 00:48:22,100
He says I

1038
00:48:22,100 --> 00:48:25,380
I just wanted to talk with you a little bit more about your...

1039
00:48:25,380 --> 00:48:27,140
So that's not gonna...

1040
00:48:27,140 --> 00:48:28,740
That's gonna defeat the purpose.

1041
00:48:28,740 --> 00:48:30,180
Oh, not even visible.

1042
00:48:30,180 --> 00:48:33,580
I wanted to talk with you a little bit more about your investigation.

1043
00:48:33,580 --> 00:48:38,660
I know you're looking into playtime and I understand why.

1044
00:48:38,660 --> 00:48:40,980
He took your boy, presumably.

1045
00:48:40,980 --> 00:48:44,260
That's obviously very important, I understand.

1046
00:48:44,260 --> 00:48:48,340
But I just wanna make sure...

1047
00:48:48,340 --> 00:48:51,700
that there's some clarity as to...

1048
00:48:51,700 --> 00:48:56,700
what is probably actually going on here and I want you to know

1049
00:48:56,700 --> 00:49:00,940
to help make all this go much more smoothly

1050
00:49:00,940 --> 00:49:04,700
okay so go ahead and tell us

1051
00:49:04,700 --> 00:49:08,020
am I still on the pocket?

1052
00:49:08,020 --> 00:49:12,300
yeah you could be on the phone. Wait hold on can we call our friend

1053
00:49:12,300 --> 00:49:15,740
I'm muted. This sounds important

1054
00:49:15,740 --> 00:49:19,860
can we call her boy?

1055
00:49:19,860 --> 00:49:21,860
And I got a baby named Leo.

1056
00:49:21,860 --> 00:49:24,120
(laughing)

1057
00:49:24,120 --> 00:49:26,540
Ya ba dee doo, ya ba dee doo.

1058
00:49:26,540 --> 00:49:33,260
Now you, I'm a big fan of King Leo.

1059
00:49:33,260 --> 00:49:35,060
I like what he's doing here.

1060
00:49:35,060 --> 00:49:37,380
New sovereign state, right?

1061
00:49:37,380 --> 00:49:41,060
This is a good thing, something to challenge Gun City.

1062
00:49:41,060 --> 00:49:42,740
I don't know if you boys are too young

1063
00:49:42,740 --> 00:49:44,060
to remember the Vampire Wars,

1064
00:49:44,060 --> 00:49:45,860
and you guys were not too young.

1065
00:49:45,860 --> 00:49:47,740
You guys were in the Vampire Wars

1066
00:49:47,740 --> 00:49:49,020
in the very first invasion.

1067
00:49:49,020 --> 00:49:50,120
I remember it.

1068
00:49:50,120 --> 00:49:51,120
I go.

1069
00:49:51,120 --> 00:49:52,120
That was the one where I were the pig.

1070
00:49:52,120 --> 00:49:53,120
We were too young.

1071
00:49:53,120 --> 00:49:54,120
That was our friend Colin the pig.

1072
00:49:54,120 --> 00:49:55,120
Colin the pig.

1073
00:49:55,120 --> 00:49:56,120
Oh yeah, Colin the pig.

1074
00:49:56,120 --> 00:50:00,480
But you guys swore to never talk about him or I think or it again maybe because of how

1075
00:50:00,480 --> 00:50:01,480
traumatic it was when you lost Colin.

1076
00:50:01,480 --> 00:50:02,480
Yeah, we were too young to remember.

1077
00:50:02,480 --> 00:50:03,480
Yep.

1078
00:50:03,480 --> 00:50:04,480
On my end, where did I lose anybody?

1079
00:50:04,480 --> 00:50:05,480
I'm 15.

1080
00:50:05,480 --> 00:50:06,480
I'm moving into the new place.

1081
00:50:06,480 --> 00:50:07,480
Just don't worry about, he's finishing something.

1082
00:50:07,480 --> 00:50:08,480
On my end all you can hear is "Ahhhhhh!"

1083
00:50:08,480 --> 00:50:09,480
You're already muted.

1084
00:50:09,480 --> 00:50:10,480
I already said you were muted.

1085
00:50:10,480 --> 00:50:11,480
Wow.

1086
00:50:11,480 --> 00:50:12,480
Wait, who is this guy who's talking?

1087
00:50:12,480 --> 00:50:13,480
Is this Evan?

1088
00:50:13,480 --> 00:50:14,480
I don't know.

1089
00:50:14,480 --> 00:50:15,480
I don't know.

1090
00:50:15,480 --> 00:50:16,480
I don't know.

1091
00:50:16,480 --> 00:50:22,840
Wow. Wait, who is this guy who's talking? Is this... Gummi Superior. He's the head of the ship.

1092
00:50:22,840 --> 00:50:30,280
He says, "The vampire wars were pretty bad. I should know. I was a war hero in those

1093
00:50:30,280 --> 00:50:36,160
wars. What I will say is that I think we might be on the precipice of another kind

1094
00:50:36,160 --> 00:50:42,360
of war between Leo and Gun City, between the Empire of New England and Gun City.

1095
00:50:42,360 --> 00:50:44,360
And why am I talking about this?

1096
00:50:44,360 --> 00:50:45,360
This doesn't have to do with playtime.

1097
00:50:45,360 --> 00:50:46,360
Well, it does.

1098
00:50:46,360 --> 00:50:49,360
Because what's happening here

1099
00:50:49,360 --> 00:50:51,360
is you're being sent on little errands

1100
00:50:51,360 --> 00:50:55,360
to go take care of a supposed serial killer.

1101
00:50:55,360 --> 00:50:58,360
And somebody's calling me.

1102
00:50:58,360 --> 00:51:01,360
It's very distracting.

1103
00:51:01,360 --> 00:51:04,360
Take care of a supposed serial killer?

1104
00:51:04,360 --> 00:51:09,360
I don't think that's what's happening here.

1105
00:51:09,360 --> 00:51:11,360
How do I explain this to you?

1106
00:51:11,360 --> 00:51:17,600
When Belinda hired you guys, what information did she give you about playtime?

1107
00:51:17,600 --> 00:51:21,040
Well, she said she had a crush. She wouldn't say who it was.

1108
00:51:21,040 --> 00:51:23,440
But it was heavily implied that it was me.

1109
00:51:23,440 --> 00:51:24,400
So nothing?

1110
00:51:24,400 --> 00:51:25,040
Yes.

1111
00:51:25,040 --> 00:51:27,200
And she said we couldn't have a pizza.

1112
00:51:27,200 --> 00:51:30,160
[laughter]

1113
00:51:30,160 --> 00:51:40,880
What I think is happening here is that Leo the Collector, or King Leo, has a unique opportunity to build a world without crime.

1114
00:51:40,880 --> 00:51:45,280
You see what I'm saying? This is a new sovereignty. He's accepting the undercity

1115
00:51:45,280 --> 00:51:50,520
because he has to. Because he feels like he has to. And rather than taking care of

1116
00:51:50,520 --> 00:51:55,280
that problem, he draws the attention to this serial killer. I don't think this

1117
00:51:55,280 --> 00:52:01,320
serial killer is a serial killer at all. I think it's a sort of a happenstance,

1118
00:52:01,320 --> 00:52:05,880
right? This is this is all just a show. And what's happening here is that the

1119
00:52:05,880 --> 00:52:15,360
under city is after you boys. Piss, Johnson, Yoda. These names mean something now. You're

1120
00:52:15,360 --> 00:52:19,640
not just three nobodies, you are legends in Gun City.

1121
00:52:19,640 --> 00:52:21,960
That's fuckin' right.

1122
00:52:21,960 --> 00:52:31,160
I think, why would a serial killer who's been murdering everybody take one boy? Unless,

1123
00:52:31,160 --> 00:52:35,120
suddenly there was a reason to take the boy, because maybe they wanted people to be interested

1124
00:52:35,120 --> 00:52:40,040
investigating maybe certain people want you to go deeper and deeper and dig

1125
00:52:40,040 --> 00:52:46,680
deeper until you're just a drive-by murder in the under city just a three

1126
00:52:46,680 --> 00:52:51,720
heroes died on vacation they can't kill you when you're I start crying when I

1127
00:52:51,720 --> 00:52:53,720
- It's a fancy hotel.

1128
00:52:53,720 --> 00:52:56,120
- It's like, I just start sobbing,

1129
00:52:56,120 --> 00:52:58,360
just the idea of someone dying on vacation.

1130
00:52:58,360 --> 00:52:59,840
(laughing)

1131
00:52:59,840 --> 00:53:01,560
- Now, now, don't cry, don't cry.

1132
00:53:01,560 --> 00:53:03,140
- Let alone a hero.

1133
00:53:03,140 --> 00:53:05,400
(laughing)

1134
00:53:05,400 --> 00:53:08,760
- I want you to keep doing what you're doing.

1135
00:53:08,760 --> 00:53:09,960
I think it's good work.

1136
00:53:09,960 --> 00:53:13,080
It sounds like you're trying to figure out what's going on,

1137
00:53:13,080 --> 00:53:17,640
and that's good, but what I want you to think about is,

1138
00:53:17,640 --> 00:53:20,240
if you had a chance to destroy the criminal underworld

1139
00:53:20,240 --> 00:53:22,440
before it even became a thing.

1140
00:53:22,440 --> 00:53:24,200
If we could destroy it in this nation

1141
00:53:24,200 --> 00:53:26,480
and not let things turn out like Gun City,

1142
00:53:26,480 --> 00:53:28,960
we could create a nation of peace.

1143
00:53:28,960 --> 00:53:30,840
We could start here.

1144
00:53:30,840 --> 00:53:34,200
All I ask of you is to just,

1145
00:53:34,200 --> 00:53:37,080
as you're investigating this serial killer,

1146
00:53:37,080 --> 00:53:39,020
let me know what's going on,

1147
00:53:39,020 --> 00:53:40,880
because I actually have the armed forces.

1148
00:53:40,880 --> 00:53:42,940
I have veterans who fought in the vampire wars

1149
00:53:42,940 --> 00:53:44,320
who followed me up here.

1150
00:53:44,320 --> 00:53:47,840
And if we get enough, you know,

1151
00:53:47,840 --> 00:53:50,960
evidence or circumstantial even,

1152
00:53:50,960 --> 00:53:53,300
about what's actually going on down there,

1153
00:53:53,300 --> 00:53:55,880
I can bust that whole thing wide open

1154
00:53:55,880 --> 00:53:58,240
and slaughter every last one of them.

1155
00:53:58,240 --> 00:54:01,400
And you boys would get your boy back

1156
00:54:01,400 --> 00:54:03,960
because you know that's where it is.

1157
00:54:03,960 --> 00:54:07,360
It's in the undercity, it's huge-ass facts,

1158
00:54:07,360 --> 00:54:10,820
as your boy, that has to be what it is.

1159
00:54:10,820 --> 00:54:14,520
I hear somebody raising their hand.

1160
00:54:14,520 --> 00:54:17,360
- I've been on speakerphone this whole time with Baby Gant.

1161
00:54:17,360 --> 00:54:19,620
(laughing)

1162
00:54:19,620 --> 00:54:24,360
- He just heard all of this shit.

1163
00:54:24,360 --> 00:54:26,280
- Damn.

1164
00:54:26,280 --> 00:54:27,460
- Damn.

1165
00:54:27,460 --> 00:54:29,860
- Maybe you guys like, whoa.

1166
00:54:29,860 --> 00:54:32,120
(laughing)

1167
00:54:32,120 --> 00:54:37,480
- Sir, yes sir, we'll kill all the whiteys downstairs.

1168
00:54:37,480 --> 00:54:39,340
- No, that's not, no, well.

1169
00:54:39,340 --> 00:54:42,020
- Heard you loud and clear.

1170
00:54:42,020 --> 00:54:45,480
- I'm saying to get me evidence, work with me,

1171
00:54:45,480 --> 00:54:49,320
Don't worry about Belinda, keep giving her bullshit, that's what she's giving you.

1172
00:54:49,320 --> 00:54:53,660
I can get you guys your son back.

1173
00:54:53,660 --> 00:54:55,200
He's not a part of the crime syndicate.

1174
00:54:55,200 --> 00:54:56,440
He's just kind of...

1175
00:54:56,440 --> 00:54:58,440
He could relay this information.

1176
00:54:58,440 --> 00:55:03,040
He is obviously indebted to them and O'Neal is one of his guys.

1177
00:55:03,040 --> 00:55:08,520
There's sort of a like, you're part of a smaller group kind of thing going on it seems like,

1178
00:55:08,520 --> 00:55:14,840
but you still have to kick up to the actual larger crime syndicate.

1179
00:55:14,840 --> 00:55:19,040
Can I roll insight on this and see just what I can glean?

1180
00:55:19,040 --> 00:55:20,040
Yeah, absolutely.

1181
00:55:20,040 --> 00:55:21,040
Be careful with that.

1182
00:55:21,040 --> 00:55:22,040
Use the six die.

1183
00:55:22,040 --> 00:55:23,520
Can I roll glean?

1184
00:55:23,520 --> 00:55:26,280
Can I reuse Caleb's die?

1185
00:55:26,280 --> 00:55:33,160
Oh my god, a nat 20.

1186
00:55:33,160 --> 00:55:34,160
That was a good move.

1187
00:55:34,160 --> 00:55:35,160
What do you glean?

1188
00:55:35,160 --> 00:55:36,160
Get this away from me.

1189
00:55:36,160 --> 00:55:37,160
Put that back in the bag.

1190
00:55:37,160 --> 00:55:38,160
I'll trade it up.

1191
00:55:38,160 --> 00:55:39,160
Actually, we'll just all use mine.

1192
00:55:39,160 --> 00:55:41,160
I'll trade it up. Actually, we'll just all use mine.

1193
00:55:41,160 --> 00:55:45,160
I need to think about what you get to know with a natural 20.

1194
00:55:45,160 --> 00:55:46,160
All of it.

1195
00:55:46,160 --> 00:55:49,160
About his motivations here. Give me a second.

1196
00:55:49,160 --> 00:55:58,160
First thing, he believes what he's saying.

1197
00:55:58,160 --> 00:55:59,160
Okay.

1198
00:55:59,160 --> 00:56:02,160
He's not pulling your leg.

1199
00:56:02,160 --> 00:56:04,160
Do you actually believe that bullshit?

1200
00:56:04,160 --> 00:56:07,160
[Laughter]

1201
00:56:07,160 --> 00:56:09,920
- Hey buddy, this is between you and I.

1202
00:56:09,920 --> 00:56:11,080
(laughing)

1203
00:56:11,080 --> 00:56:15,000
- He obviously is playing up certain aspects of it

1204
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:18,240
based on hunches because he wants you guys

1205
00:56:18,240 --> 00:56:23,240
to help him rid the pleasure palace of the under city

1206
00:56:23,240 --> 00:56:28,360
basically entirely, not because he knows for sure

1207
00:56:28,360 --> 00:56:30,320
Huge Ass Vax has your kid.

1208
00:56:30,320 --> 00:56:32,800
He just thinks that seems way more likely

1209
00:56:32,800 --> 00:56:37,080
than some rogue serial killer who he thinks

1210
00:56:37,080 --> 00:56:42,080
is just a circumstance of there being a criminal underworld.

1211
00:56:42,080 --> 00:56:44,400
It's like this guy is not, he didn't take your kid.

1212
00:56:44,400 --> 00:56:46,160
Why would you think he did?

1213
00:56:46,160 --> 00:56:47,760
- He has not seen the Giants.

1214
00:56:47,760 --> 00:56:49,920
- It was just blamed on play time

1215
00:56:49,920 --> 00:56:51,640
just because it was convenient.

1216
00:56:51,640 --> 00:56:54,680
What else you got?

1217
00:56:54,680 --> 00:56:56,000
The fucking 20, good God.

1218
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:57,400
What else can you?

1219
00:56:57,400 --> 00:56:59,080
- He has to know 20 things.

1220
00:56:59,080 --> 00:57:00,360
- Yeah.

1221
00:57:00,360 --> 00:57:02,720
- I'm just thinking 'cause he, so.

1222
00:57:02,720 --> 00:57:05,760
- Okay, with that 20, does Baby Cat definitely hear that?

1223
00:57:05,760 --> 00:57:09,840
I mean, that doesn't carry over, but I would say--

1224
00:57:09,840 --> 00:57:10,680
- I don't know.

1225
00:57:10,680 --> 00:57:11,500
- But he did--

1226
00:57:11,500 --> 00:57:12,340
- It makes the story very interesting.

1227
00:57:12,340 --> 00:57:13,600
- Baby Gadd did hear it.

1228
00:57:13,600 --> 00:57:16,660
You did that, and this guy said okay,

1229
00:57:16,660 --> 00:57:20,760
and I did not have him like check on that.

1230
00:57:20,760 --> 00:57:21,600
How could he?

1231
00:57:21,600 --> 00:57:22,700
He just trusted you guys.

1232
00:57:22,700 --> 00:57:28,880
So, what else did you get with a 20?

1233
00:57:28,880 --> 00:57:30,040
- Favorite color?

1234
00:57:30,040 --> 00:57:30,880
- Blue.

1235
00:57:30,880 --> 00:57:32,240
That's my favorite color, stupid.

1236
00:57:32,240 --> 00:57:34,080
(laughing)

1237
00:57:34,080 --> 00:57:34,920
- You're gonna get hacked, bro.

1238
00:57:34,920 --> 00:57:36,400
- You shouldn't give information out like that.

1239
00:57:36,400 --> 00:57:37,240
- Yeah, I'm sorry.

1240
00:57:37,240 --> 00:57:39,320
- That's a number one security question.

1241
00:57:39,320 --> 00:57:40,640
- It's always what's your favorite color

1242
00:57:40,640 --> 00:57:42,080
and who was Arnold?

1243
00:57:42,080 --> 00:57:42,920
- Yeah.

1244
00:57:42,920 --> 00:57:46,960
- You also...

1245
00:57:46,960 --> 00:57:49,200
(laughing)

1246
00:57:49,200 --> 00:57:51,320
- Who was Arnold to you?

1247
00:57:51,320 --> 00:57:58,800
- You also can sense in how he's talking

1248
00:57:58,800 --> 00:58:04,680
that he is extremely nervous about his life.

1249
00:58:04,680 --> 00:58:09,680
about Huge Ass Facts, not about a criminal enterprise,

1250
00:58:09,680 --> 00:58:13,720
but about Huge Ass Facts specifically.

1251
00:58:13,720 --> 00:58:18,280
When he said his name, that, with your 20 insight,

1252
00:58:18,280 --> 00:58:22,640
you were like, he either has a crush on this guy,

1253
00:58:22,640 --> 00:58:28,680
or he's really, really scared of him, his enterprise.

1254
00:58:28,680 --> 00:58:30,400
All that sounded like abstracts,

1255
00:58:30,400 --> 00:58:34,880
compared to like the kind of stank he put on that.

1256
00:58:34,880 --> 00:58:37,000
- He stunk it up.

1257
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:38,440
- He stunk it up.

1258
00:58:38,440 --> 00:58:39,520
- Made a stank.

1259
00:58:39,520 --> 00:58:43,400
- And I would also say that when he talked--

1260
00:58:43,400 --> 00:58:45,760
- He went like, "Huge ass facts."

1261
00:58:45,760 --> 00:58:48,040
- He made a base face when he said it.

1262
00:58:48,040 --> 00:58:49,660
He said, "Huge ass facts."

1263
00:58:49,660 --> 00:58:55,000
- Also when he talked about his admiration for Leo,

1264
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:57,440
that's not true at all.

1265
00:58:57,440 --> 00:58:58,860
He does not admire Leo.

1266
00:58:58,860 --> 00:59:03,860
He does feel like, from what you can tell,

1267
00:59:03,860 --> 00:59:09,300
that this is an opportunity to create a nation

1268
00:59:09,300 --> 00:59:11,300
that he would like.

1269
00:59:11,300 --> 00:59:12,140
- Okay.

1270
00:59:12,140 --> 00:59:16,100
- One that wouldn't have wars, he does not want war,

1271
00:59:16,100 --> 00:59:21,100
but what does it mean to basically try to do

1272
00:59:21,100 --> 00:59:24,620
what he's trying to do?

1273
00:59:24,620 --> 00:59:25,460
- Genocide.

1274
00:59:25,460 --> 00:59:27,100
- He's a Hitler guy.

1275
00:59:27,100 --> 00:59:27,940
- Yeah.

1276
00:59:27,940 --> 00:59:34,260
Leftoid he's a lefty. He's basically he's a lot more a lot more like our stall a worse

1277
00:59:34,260 --> 00:59:43,840
Trillions of people that and if you honestly if you don't believe that by the way fucking up unsubscribe right now

1278
00:59:43,840 --> 00:59:48,840
That's right. Do not don't say no one else. Do not do not give me another give you like Stalin

1279
00:59:48,840 --> 00:59:53,400
Do not give me another fucking dollar. Yeah, also your cringe and your cringe and this

1280
00:59:53,400 --> 00:59:56,700
Okay

1281
00:59:56,700 --> 01:00:00,700
Um, yeah. And if you like Hitler, stay tuned.

1282
01:00:00,700 --> 01:00:03,700
And we'll end it there. We'll end it there. I think we should end it there.

1283
01:00:03,700 --> 01:00:08,700
Okay, now you relay all of this to me over the phone so that baby Gadd knows.

1284
01:00:08,700 --> 01:00:13,700
We already did it. No, like the info, all the stuff that he said about...

1285
01:00:13,700 --> 01:00:17,700
Caleb left. All the stuff that he said about how much he doesn't like me or...

1286
01:00:17,700 --> 01:00:21,700
He just went to the bathroom. We're done. Okay. It's over.

1287
01:00:21,700 --> 01:00:25,700
Bye bye. Bye family. Bye family.

1288
01:00:25,700 --> 01:00:28,280
(upbeat music)

1289
01:00:28,280 --> 01:00:30,860
(upbeat music)

1290
01:00:30,860 --> 01:00:33,440
(upbeat music)

1291
01:00:33,440 --> 01:00:36,020
(upbeat music)

1292
01:00:36,020 --> 01:00:38,020
Yeah!
