00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,320
*outro music*

2
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:09,320
Clap if you want.

3
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:11,720
No you can't because the whole point is there's only one clap.

4
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:12,220
You can clap.

5
00:00:12,220 --> 00:00:13,220
No you can't clap.

6
00:00:13,220 --> 00:00:14,720
You said you can't clap, asshole.

7
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:15,720
You can't clap.

8
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:19,220
It's not me, I mean I'm just trying to be a friend to our poor friend.

9
00:00:19,220 --> 00:00:20,220
I bet you're pissed off.

10
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:21,220
I'm not pissed off at all.

11
00:00:21,220 --> 00:00:22,720
Oh I bet you're mad.

12
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:24,720
No the issue is you can't clap once at the beginning.

13
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:25,720
*imitates clapping*

14
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:26,720
You can do that all you want.

15
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:27,720
*imitates clapping*

16
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:28,720
I can do that too.

17
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:30,080
(imitates a song)

18
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:31,600
- You're copying now.

19
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:32,440
You're completely copying.

20
00:00:32,440 --> 00:00:33,640
- I've been copied before I did though.

21
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:35,240
- I'm the one who did it first.

22
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:36,240
- He clapped first.

23
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:39,280
- I clapped first and I also raised the roof first

24
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:41,200
and it's all on video now, so.

25
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:42,040
- Video proof.

26
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:42,860
- Every single person.

27
00:00:42,860 --> 00:00:45,080
- Well now because you guys clapped,

28
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:46,760
the video's out of sync so it's impossible

29
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:47,600
to tell who did it first.

30
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:50,200
- But then we re-synced it with a (imitates a song)

31
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:51,040
- That's true.

32
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:53,680
That is what a lot of audio engineers use to sync.

33
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:56,200
- Audio engineers use the whoop whoop

34
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:58,880
to sync up every single song.

35
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:00,320
- I don't think that those people should be able

36
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:01,960
to call themselves engineers.

37
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:03,120
That's a little too--

38
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:04,720
- They should call themselves songgineers.

39
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:06,960
- A little too generous, I think, to call them engineers.

40
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:08,920
- Engineers, yeah, they're not really building anything.

41
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:09,760
- They're not doing much.

42
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:10,580
- Yeah.

43
00:01:10,580 --> 00:01:11,880
- They're not building a rail road.

44
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:13,960
- Yeah, they're not building a rail road.

45
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:14,800
- Yeah.

46
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:16,880
- I was stretching in the middle of that.

47
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:17,720
- Yeah.

48
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:18,720
- Somebody's mic is going nuts.

49
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:19,920
- Whose mic is going nuts?

50
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:20,760
- I don't know.

51
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:21,800
- Probably yours.

52
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:23,000
- It's probably not mine.

53
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,160
- It's probably yours.

54
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:25,000
- It's always Patrick's.

55
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:25,840
- It is always Patrick's.

56
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:27,920
- Patrick, is your mic close to your phone?

57
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:29,340
- My phone is in my pocket.

58
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:30,800
- My phone, don't know where it is.

59
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:31,800
- It's true, it's gone.

60
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:32,640
- Somewhere in the office.

61
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:33,600
- We lost Caleb's phone.

62
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:36,040
- Tried finding it, didn't do it.

63
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:38,240
It's also, it's this big, it's very old.

64
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:39,080
- It's not that big.

65
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:39,900
- It's this big.

66
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:40,740
- It's not that big.

67
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:42,020
- It's an iPod shuffle or a butterfly.

68
00:01:42,020 --> 00:01:42,860
What's that thing called?

69
00:01:42,860 --> 00:01:43,980
You know.

70
00:01:43,980 --> 00:01:44,820
- Firefly.

71
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:46,320
- It's a firefly, I can only call my parents

72
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:47,480
in a Domino's pizza.

73
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:49,520
There's two buttons and that's it.

74
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:50,720
Hard to find it.

75
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:51,720
- It's not that big though.

76
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:52,560
- I tried to--

77
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:53,380
- It's huge.

78
00:01:53,380 --> 00:01:59,620
We bought new storage units and then yesterday we found out we what it's hurt or the storage things

79
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:02,340
This is what nerds call shelves

80
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:05,020
storage unit

81
00:02:05,020 --> 00:02:12,260
Parental unit, can you fix me a bedtime story from the storage unit that the lights went out yesterday?

82
00:02:12,260 --> 00:02:14,260
You thought all I was the one who solved it. So I

83
00:02:14,260 --> 00:02:21,820
On that wall you're doing a horrible job explaining this story, okay

84
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:28,140
The where I was going with this yeah, I I texted the super so you're just skipping the story completely

85
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:34,980
I texted the super to tell her like hey all of the lights went out. Yeah, and then she texted me. Let me

86
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:38,420
Read this text

87
00:02:38,420 --> 00:02:43,220
Nope that's a different person don't have it pulled up in advance or anything no

88
00:02:43,220 --> 00:02:46,300
Yeah, by all means don't have it pulled up in advance. Yeah, hi

89
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:51,740
did you get back lights? Read that textual unit Patrick. The Kirkit break to Ter is on

90
00:02:51,740 --> 00:02:58,180
there. Wait, now I actually am interested. Hi did you get back lights? The Kirkit break

91
00:02:58,180 --> 00:03:05,180
to Ter is on there. Just say no. Can I see this message? I said yes when we got them

92
00:03:05,180 --> 00:03:09,860
back. But I realized. It really does say Kirkit. I texted her and then forgot that she has

93
00:03:09,860 --> 00:03:14,940
a jitterbug. Oh she has a jitterbug? Yeah. That's like the old lady version of a firefly?

94
00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:21,400
Oh, man with the big buttons. I want one of those I do too. Yeah, that would be Kirk it break is on to tour

95
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:26,000
It doesn't seem like that easy to text on one of those no because I bet you using t9

96
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,540
Yeah, what's t9 t9 the old one where you press the keys?

97
00:03:29,540 --> 00:03:40,640
No, that's called t9. I think she's using she's using a system called t1000 where there's a thousand buttons and each has a word

98
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:44,380
Unfortunately, there was no button for circuit, but there's one there was for Kirk it

99
00:03:44,380 --> 00:03:46,920
(laughing)

100
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:48,220
- You doing a stretching session?

101
00:03:48,220 --> 00:03:49,140
- Yeah, stretching and--

102
00:03:49,140 --> 00:03:53,380
- I went to town on myself with a Theragun this morning.

103
00:03:53,380 --> 00:03:54,480
- You have a Theragun?

104
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:56,580
- Yeah, well it's a bootleg one.

105
00:03:56,580 --> 00:03:58,040
It's like a $20 one.

106
00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:00,020
- You went to town on yourself?

107
00:04:00,020 --> 00:04:02,340
- Went to town on yourself with a Theragun?

108
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:03,180
- Yeah, dude, I sat--

109
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:04,780
- What kind of moves are you putting on yourself?

110
00:04:04,780 --> 00:04:06,580
- Rose petals up to the bed.

111
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:07,420
- Yeah.

112
00:04:07,420 --> 00:04:08,260
(laughing)

113
00:04:08,260 --> 00:04:09,860
Does the Theragun approach you

114
00:04:09,860 --> 00:04:11,780
or do you approach the Theragun?

115
00:04:11,780 --> 00:04:12,900
- What do you mean?

116
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:15,500
Are you splayed out on the bed and a Theragun walks in,

117
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:17,380
or do you walk in and use the Theragun?

118
00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:20,460
- I pick it up from my nightstand.

119
00:04:20,460 --> 00:04:22,740
- Have you ever just beat the shit out of your balls with it?

120
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:23,580
- No.

121
00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:24,460
(imitates gun firing)

122
00:04:24,460 --> 00:04:25,340
Haven't yet.

123
00:04:25,340 --> 00:04:28,180
- Do you think you might now?

124
00:04:28,180 --> 00:04:29,180
- I gotta get the...

125
00:04:29,180 --> 00:04:32,580
- The ball sucker attachment.

126
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:34,180
- Yeah, the ball attachment.

127
00:04:34,180 --> 00:04:35,020
- Yeah.

128
00:04:35,020 --> 00:04:37,740
- I don't have, it's like, it's not an official Theragun,

129
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:41,860
it's clearly like one of those $20 pneumatic massagers.

130
00:04:41,860 --> 00:04:42,860
That's what you call it.

131
00:04:42,860 --> 00:04:46,180
But I was just like

132
00:04:46,180 --> 00:04:47,940
going crazy with it.

133
00:04:47,940 --> 00:04:49,220
I still feel like shit.

134
00:04:49,220 --> 00:04:52,440
I had it on the highest setting.

135
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:54,780
I was sitting there just like get

136
00:04:54,780 --> 00:04:55,660
my knees.

137
00:04:55,660 --> 00:04:56,660
Yeah. Taking them out.

138
00:04:56,660 --> 00:04:58,440
I go into town.

139
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:00,340
My legs still feel like shit.

140
00:05:00,340 --> 00:05:02,500
I haven't skated in two weeks

141
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:03,960
and then just started trying to like

142
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:04,960
skate again.

143
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:07,300
And I feel like an old man.

144
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:08,220
You know, we do that.

145
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:09,460
We do about one.

146
00:05:09,460 --> 00:05:11,220
We do. We spend all this time.

147
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:14,000
We built all this set, knew this whole thing.

148
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,300
Oh my God, aliens have invaded.

149
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:18,000
You said that we didn't want to.

150
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Two days later, it's just back to, yeah, I've been skating a lot.

151
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,900
I really like it. I really like that.

152
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:28,400
I think the set shouldn't limit us to talking about our lives with each other.

153
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:32,000
That's true, to reaching for higher and higher dizzying heights of creativity.

154
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,400
Trying to change the entire medium of podcasting.

155
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:35,900
Right.

156
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:39,000
Maybe some skating talk and, oh, I'm sore.

157
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:39,500
Yeah.

158
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:45,500
I'm tired, my stomach hurts, maybe we get back into that kind of trifecta that we have.

159
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:47,180
You're tired, your stomach hurts.

160
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:48,180
My stomach doesn't hurt today.

161
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:49,180
It feels completely fine.

162
00:05:49,180 --> 00:05:50,180
That's a whole new combination that we may be discovering.

163
00:05:50,180 --> 00:05:51,180
Yesterday, your stomach hurt a lot.

164
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:56,020
See, and now he's making us talk about a hurt stomach.

165
00:05:56,020 --> 00:05:58,100
I did not have a stomachache at all yesterday.

166
00:05:58,100 --> 00:05:59,100
Yeah, you did.

167
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:01,280
Did you hear that?

168
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:02,280
What is wrong with you?

169
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:03,280
That was my race.

170
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:04,280
I hate you.

171
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:05,280
Oh man.

172
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:07,040
(laughing)

173
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:07,880
- Oh man.

174
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:09,160
- I was watching, okay, what do you know,

175
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:11,480
what I was doing yesterday, I was watching a movie.

176
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:12,320
- Yeah.

177
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:13,640
- And you know how in every disaster movie,

178
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:14,480
or movie with a disaster in it--

179
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:16,200
- No, Cameron's watching a movie, what's new?

180
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:17,120
- They have a--

181
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:19,360
- I'll pound that out, that's pretty good.

182
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:20,880
- I actually haven't watched a movie in a while.

183
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:21,720
- Okay.

184
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:23,860
- So, it's actually crazy, but the movie's not the point.

185
00:06:23,860 --> 00:06:25,400
You know how in every disaster movie,

186
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:26,400
or movie with a disaster in it,

187
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:28,720
they have the one scene where everybody in the city

188
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:32,700
is in like a big warehouse, or like a sports stadium,

189
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:33,720
or something, and they're all,

190
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:35,080
'cause their homes all got destroyed?

191
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:40,860
Yeah, they're all I really that looks so fun. It looks like the biggest slumber party ever

192
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:43,440
Yeah, when the light there's a blackout and the lights go and everyone goes

193
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:49,500
At the same time and they're all sitting there with their ever all your neighbors are there you all they have big boxes of food

194
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:52,800
They're soldiers. They're giving you food. That does look really doesn't that sound like

195
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:58,440
After tomorrow when they're in the library and they're like, oh no, we're in the fucking library

196
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:03,080
It's like the library has sells VHS movies and DVDs and video games now

197
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:07,560
Yeah, so the library is actually when you're when shit goes south. That's like the number one place you want to be yeah

198
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:13,280
It's literally like the it's like it's like your fantasy when you're a kid of all your friends living on the same street

199
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:17,640
Yeah, but they're all living in the same house and all yeah, you get a free food from a cool guy

200
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:21,940
Yeah, all your friends plus soldiers. Yeah, buddy wanted that when you were a kid exactly

201
00:07:21,940 --> 00:07:26,240
What if all my friends plus soldiers what if soldiers people in hazmat suits? Yeah, right?

202
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:29,040
I would love to go through one of those hazmat cleaner things. Oh my god

203
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:31,640
Why is that was that always such a bad thing in the movies?

204
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:38,020
Yeah, they never show you it's always behind a it's always a silhouette. It's like I bet they're coming on the other end clean

205
00:07:38,020 --> 00:07:41,400
Yeah, you know clean as a whistle. That's got to be fun

206
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:43,180
It has to be fun sometimes

207
00:07:43,180 --> 00:07:47,860
I bet you it's like it's like when you go to the doctor and you're like they do a physical and you got a hot

208
00:07:47,860 --> 00:07:49,860
Nurse I bet you sometimes get a hot person

209
00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:54,020
Cleaning you and you know the hazmat the window on the hazmat suit, you know

210
00:07:54,020 --> 00:07:58,280
Yeah, you're like and you know some of those hazmat suits the windows down here. They show a little mid riff

211
00:07:58,280 --> 00:08:01,100
Why do they do that? I don't I think it's to make you more

212
00:08:01,660 --> 00:08:05,120
Make you more well cuz you know why cuz if they're cleaning you

213
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:08,940
They don't want to have to reach between your foreskin or stuff and shit

214
00:08:08,940 --> 00:08:14,420
So it's easier if you get a boner because I can just clean your penis with a single swipe. Mm-hmm. That's true. Yeah, that makes sense

215
00:08:14,420 --> 00:08:19,380
Why are you putting Teletubbies on this maybe like I feel like maybe if I was in that situation

216
00:08:19,380 --> 00:08:22,620
I saw a hot hazmat suited nurse with a bare midriff

217
00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:26,280
It would be like, you know in Cloverfield where they have this sheet and the woman like explodes

218
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:29,980
I'll be putting a complete different kind of splatter onto the onto that she healed

219
00:08:30,580 --> 00:08:34,180
You'd be putting I'd be putting come I would see a nurse and I would shoot

220
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:38,800
It would be a silhouette of me kind of like a if you can imagine Austin Powers. Yeah, okay

221
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:43,840
Yeah similar situation, but in Cloverfield a woman explodes so and me I'm throwing a bucket of oatmeal

222
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:46,500
Wait, I'm imagining Austin Powers

223
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:52,380
Jizzing on a woman not on the woman just on the sheet, and it looks like oatmeal. Yeah

224
00:08:52,380 --> 00:08:55,680
Why would it look like oh do you oatmeal type?

225
00:08:56,480 --> 00:09:03,000
Come well in silhouette and silhouette. Okay. Oh, oh, okay. Okay, so the Austin

226
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,140
Yeah, I lost the part. I lost the

227
00:09:06,140 --> 00:09:12,400
The part there you're talking about the silhouette thing. Okay. I know I'm moving fast. Yeah. Yeah, it's some heady stuff

228
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:18,400
You shouldn't have even said mentioned Cloverfield. You should have just went immediately with Austin Powers. That's true Austin power

229
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:24,460
Yeah, that's the only they're all when they're all in the big stadium together because of the disaster. Yeah. Yeah, cuz this

230
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:31,420
That's a better movie. Austin Powers is better than Cloverfield. Oh by a long every single one of them

231
00:09:31,420 --> 00:09:39,720
Hold your roll man that third one sucks. No the third what gold member that one's ass. That's a fine movie the worst one

232
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:42,600
Yeah, but Cloverfield's a good movie good is better than fine

233
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:45,840
Cloverfield that's a very compared to Austin Powers

234
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:51,120
You already said you haven't seen it. I don't even care. I already know the fuck you're being an asshole

235
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:54,560
Don't make a total weirdo in a dick wise fine

236
00:09:54,560 --> 00:10:00,640
I don't I don't give a crap being a piece of shit take that back. No. Why would I take you?

237
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:05,080
Yes, you realize you're basically you're killing your killing knowledge and art right now

238
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:10,540
Yeah, judging art before you even have seen it before you even I don't give a shit read the cover

239
00:10:10,540 --> 00:10:15,720
You're judging a book by its cover. You're judging a DVD by its case. Yeah, that's jewel case. That's right

240
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:20,980
Doesn't come in a jewel case does it okay? I thought that was you were you were talking okay? Hold up

241
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:24,420
Never mind. I thought it was like syncing up to your speech

242
00:10:24,420 --> 00:10:33,400
The the plasma ball you thought it was syncing up to my speech like maybe like the Windows Media Player. Yeah, okay

243
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:36,200
Can we figure out how to do that?

244
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:42,600
Can we get a window start we're gonna start designing that yeah, we'll do that cuz we can put it right here

245
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:47,600
That would be way better for thing for right there than whatever is there. I don't even know what's there right now

246
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:52,320
piece of crap. I hate that thing. What is that thing? I think it might be a fly with a big

247
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:56,240
head. Oh my god, somebody kill the fly. A green ass bug. A fly just landed on that laptop.

248
00:10:56,240 --> 00:11:05,160
Pat, hit the fly. Oh, it killed him. It killed him instantly. Wow. He's got the top ten movies

249
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:10,600
of 2022 up. Do you guys see... Do you guys remember Top Gun Maverick? Yeah. Because I

250
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:14,720
forgot completely that that came out. That ish was sick. Every single movie that's come

251
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:19,360
out this year I've immediately forgot except for Marcel the shell with shoes on.

252
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:25,760
That was fire. Do you guys uh you've been seeing what this fucking maniac Kanye West

253
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:29,920
has been doing? Oh my god yeah. This guy thinks he's designing crazy shoes. He

254
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:36,160
thinks it's it's okay to wear pink polo. Really? Yeah. Is that true? He thinks that

255
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:40,640
even guys can wear pink. But he's a gangster. That's what I said. He's doing

256
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:44,480
gangster rap. He's doing all this stuff where he's like it's okay to be a rapper

257
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:49,480
and be a nerd and be into technology and dance EDM music.

258
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:51,400
This guy's sick in the fucking head.

259
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:53,080
- You know what his biggest crime is?

260
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:55,160
- I think we should blackball him from the entire industry.

261
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:58,400
- Yeah, but here's the thing about Kanye West.

262
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:03,560
I'm gonna say it, he's so dumb,

263
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:06,680
his sunglasses are obstructing his view.

264
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:07,520
- That's true. - That's true.

265
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:08,840
- Lines across them. - That's right.

266
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:10,040
- Yeah. - He's seeing the wrong.

267
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:12,600
- His sunglasses have shutters built in.

268
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:14,200
- And let me tell you-- - Make it make sense.

269
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:17,760
He's wearing these shutter shades, he's looking out at the world, he's seeing these lines across

270
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:21,280
his vision, he's seeing, "Oh, there's a line, I think I'm gonna cross that."

271
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:22,280
Yep.

272
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:23,280
Holy shit.

273
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:24,280
That's what goes through his head.

274
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:27,560
Maybe the lines that he's seeing are obscuring the, because he's meeting all these Jewish

275
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:28,960
people, he's getting all mad at them.

276
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:29,960
Yeah.

277
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:32,000
Maybe the lines are obscuring all the good charitable parts of these people.

278
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Yeah, the good qualities.

279
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:36,500
Yeah, they're being obscured by these lines in his glasses, and so he's getting the wrong

280
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:38,680
idea about an entire group of people.

281
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:39,680
Yeah.

282
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:40,680
And because other people...

283
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:41,680
That he's looking at.

284
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:45,520
people have their good parts in the places where he sees the empty thing you

285
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:49,440
know so this is a perfect sense what I'm saying yeah yeah I can see that I think

286
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:55,760
he needs to sit down I think he needs to to just to just read I think he should

287
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:59,440
I think he needs to close the shutters on those shutter shades yeah and be

288
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:03,720
completely blind that's right hey you know what I think he is blind he is

289
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:07,840
already blind you're thinking of Ray Charles racist no you're you think Kanye

290
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:12,320
West you're mixing up Ray Charles I'm not mixing up Kanye he's he's blind to the

291
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:17,320
truth so is Ray Charles he's he wasn't blind to the truth I don't think I think

292
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:21,280
he's still alive I think I think alive yeah he's still alive I think Kanye West

293
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:24,520
could start the healing by releasing a song called can tell me something

294
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:29,480
that he's ready to learn that'd be a good I'm ready to sit down and yeah yeah

295
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:35,440
you can tell me something right now and then the rest of the song is empty

296
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:37,440
because he's expecting you while you're in the car.

297
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:38,280
- Yeah, you fill it in.

298
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:39,320
- Oh, okay, well.

299
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:40,800
- What you're doing is really fucked up.

300
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:42,760
- Yeah, I really don't appreciate

301
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:44,560
how you're treating people in the Jewish community.

302
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:46,600
I think that you need to take a step back, Kanye West,

303
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:48,720
and the whole instrumental's playing underneath it.

304
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:49,880
♪ Ah ♪

305
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:51,440
That whole song.

306
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:52,280
- Yeah. - Pretty good idea.

307
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:55,440
- I thought Zach Galifianakis sang that song for so long.

308
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:58,240
- 'Cause of his music video.

309
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:00,080
- I thought that was Zach Galifianakis' song.

310
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:01,400
- Weird Al never touched that one, right?

311
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:02,400
Weird Al, Kanye's too--

312
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:04,840
- Weird Al, Weird Al, the only thing that Kanye--

313
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:10,040
Kanye. He didn't parody Kanye and that's why he's anti-semitic.

314
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:18,440
Kanye finds out that Weird Al parodies him and he's just like, "Fuck all you go Slavian people!"

315
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:25,960
Yeah, yeah. Could have been. Could be that. The only time that Weird Al has ever touched a Kanye

316
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:33,640
West song was in "Pokorama" on Straight Outta Linwood and he just sings "Gold Digger."

317
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:36,680
He did a version of Power.

318
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:37,680
He did.

319
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:38,680
Did he?

320
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:39,680
No, he didn't.

321
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:40,680
Where his head-

322
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:41,680
You're thinking of Rucka Rucka.

323
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:42,680
I don't think so.

324
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:46,680
And it was probably just as bad as what Kanye's saying now.

325
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:50,680
Kanye and Rucka Rucka doing the song!

326
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:51,680
They need to clap.

327
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:53,680
Oh my god, they should wake up.

328
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:54,680
That would be incredible.

329
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:57,680
That would be so fucking sick!

330
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:00,680
Kanye doing the Obama song?

331
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:02,680
That is so smart.

332
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:07,320
Oh wait, which Obama song? The Thrift Shop one?

333
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:11,920
Yeah. Kanye could slide in. Dude, Rucka Rucka Olly had some crazy,

334
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:16,080
crazy bars. Tell me why that guy hasn't been blackballed from Hollywood.

335
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:19,420
Yeah! No he hasn't. Yeah, what are you talking about?

336
00:15:19,420 --> 00:15:24,240
He's everywhere these days. Well he put black on his face and sang

337
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:28,400
some songs. He got black faced from Hollywood. Yeah, he got black faced from YouTube.

338
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:31,520
YouTube land. Yeah. Which is like Hollywood land.

339
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:38,000
But I think that, did you see that thing where some guy is trying to, Kanye's fitness trainer

340
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,360
was like, "I'm going to put you in the Santa Sao."

341
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:42,360
I did see that.

342
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:43,360
Kanye's fitness trainer is also-

343
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:45,760
Yeah, the thing where it's like, "You have two options, buddy."

344
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:46,760
Yeah.

345
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:47,760
Either you-

346
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:50,840
How is that guy going to get, is he going to be like, "We're going to go for a run

347
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:51,840
into that building."

348
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:55,960
Well, that guy was also Whitney Murphy's fitness trainer.

349
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:56,960
Holy shit.

350
00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:57,960
And someone else, right?

351
00:15:57,960 --> 00:15:58,960
Mac Miller.

352
00:15:58,960 --> 00:15:59,960
Mac Miller.

353
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:00,960
Holy shit.

354
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:05,060
I don't think he's a fitness trainer. I think he's a secret agent.

355
00:16:05,060 --> 00:16:08,060
Yeah, I think he's fitting this soul into hell.

356
00:16:08,060 --> 00:16:11,660
Yeah, yeah. I mean, and you know, Brittany Murphy, Mac Miller, these were

357
00:16:11,660 --> 00:16:18,260
dangerous minds. Yeah. They were trying to upset the order of the world, the

358
00:16:18,260 --> 00:16:22,160
political order in a huge way. Mac Miller wanted every single person to watch a

359
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:30,060
movie with the sound off. There are so many people who work on the

360
00:16:30,060 --> 00:16:35,460
sound design and also the musicians who write the music for the score.

361
00:16:35,460 --> 00:16:36,660
And Brittany Murphy, she was...

362
00:16:36,660 --> 00:16:38,860
He hated John Williams so much.

363
00:16:38,860 --> 00:16:43,560
Brittany Murphy, Mac Miller, both were on the verge of a Dr. Sebi documentary coming out.

364
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:45,760
And they got... they both got killed.

365
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:46,460
They got got...

366
00:16:46,460 --> 00:16:47,460
This personal trainer.

367
00:16:47,460 --> 00:16:47,960
Yeah, yeah.

368
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:48,560
And little Pete.

369
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:53,060
I did what... when I was looking at that, the thing I saw about that personal trainer,

370
00:16:53,060 --> 00:16:58,760
and like there was like a Twitter thread about like how he was the personal trainer for all these celebrities who died.

371
00:16:58,760 --> 00:16:59,460
Yeah.

372
00:16:59,460 --> 00:17:01,660
By the way, not that good at training your people.

373
00:17:01,660 --> 00:17:02,500
No, yeah.

374
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:04,640
You need to work harder.

375
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:06,380
But there's one of the top, like,

376
00:17:06,380 --> 00:17:07,740
top of the list is like,

377
00:17:07,740 --> 00:17:11,260
oh boy, this guy's gonna get suicided soon, isn't he?

378
00:17:11,260 --> 00:17:14,340
It's the idea of like, the Clintons like killing

379
00:17:14,340 --> 00:17:16,860
this personal trainer.

380
00:17:16,860 --> 00:17:17,780
I feel like it's more likely

381
00:17:17,780 --> 00:17:20,940
that Kanye gets suicided, right?

382
00:17:20,940 --> 00:17:21,940
Yeah. Yeah.

383
00:17:21,940 --> 00:17:23,220
But nobody would believe that.

384
00:17:23,220 --> 00:17:24,860
That'd probably be the easiest,

385
00:17:24,860 --> 00:17:26,780
most debunkable one of all time, right?

386
00:17:26,780 --> 00:17:27,620
Yeah.

387
00:17:27,620 --> 00:17:33,180
he would ever kill himself? Hell no. He would never kill himself. I don't know, maybe. I

388
00:17:33,180 --> 00:17:37,820
think about it. If he did kill himself, that'd be the craziest concert ever. That would be

389
00:17:37,820 --> 00:17:40,900
actually pretty cool. Because it would be at a concert, he would do what G.G. Allen

390
00:17:40,900 --> 00:17:47,700
set out to do. What was that? G.G. Allen was going to kill himself on Halloween. That guy

391
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:51,900
was something else. Yeah, I know, he's scary. That guy was just something fucking else. What

392
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:54,980
kind of a brain thinks of an idea like that? I don't even, sorry, wait, wait, wait, sorry.

393
00:17:54,980 --> 00:17:57,880
I like the shit eating, the racism, and the killing yourself.

394
00:17:57,880 --> 00:18:01,520
Killing yourself is one thing, but what kind of fucking sick, twisted psycho

395
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:04,020
would do it on Halloween of all the nights in the world?

396
00:18:04,020 --> 00:18:05,280
It's too far.

397
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:08,020
He couldn't do it because he overdosed on heroin.

398
00:18:08,020 --> 00:18:11,020
Well, maybe somebody tried to stop his plan.

399
00:18:11,020 --> 00:18:12,520
Yeah. Wait, wait, G.G.

400
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:14,580
Allen's personal trainer. Holy shit.

401
00:18:14,580 --> 00:18:17,320
Yep. Same guy. No way. It was Kanye West.

402
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:20,280
This guy hates Halloween or loves Christmas and was like,

403
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:23,140
I can't, can't let that go through. Yeah.

404
00:18:23,140 --> 00:18:27,600
We can't let this is this holiday is already so dark, you know, yeah

405
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:30,500
This is Halloween

406
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:36,360
Well, that was actually that same same guy who was trying to keep Halloween from getting too evil was actually

407
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:40,700
behind the scenes produced nightmare before Christmas because it's

408
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:48,220
Injecting Christmas into Halloween and bringing fun to Halloween and a happy holiday combining you can you disgusting movie?

409
00:18:48,220 --> 00:18:52,060
Can you pull up a photo of what Kanye's personal trainer looks like?

410
00:18:52,060 --> 00:18:54,580
I think his name is Harvey or Harley.

411
00:18:54,580 --> 00:18:55,580
Kanye-us trainer.

412
00:18:55,580 --> 00:18:56,580
Kanye-us trainer.

413
00:18:56,580 --> 00:18:59,580
Okay, this is, wait, pull this up right now.

414
00:18:59,580 --> 00:19:01,340
He's a pair of shoes.

415
00:19:01,340 --> 00:19:03,660
So pull, no, put this up.

416
00:19:03,660 --> 00:19:05,700
This is, I guess, this is his trainer.

417
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:09,140
Can you show everybody the phrase that you Googled for us right now on Patrick Essac?

418
00:19:09,140 --> 00:19:11,060
Can you just go to this other tab and show them?

419
00:19:11,060 --> 00:19:12,060
Zoom in right here.

420
00:19:12,060 --> 00:19:13,060
Kanye-us trainer.

421
00:19:13,060 --> 00:19:17,500
I'm feeling this becoming a compilation pretty quickly of Juvio fucking up.

422
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:22,900
Okay, so this is a US trainer personal. Okay. Well, he's doing Spanish grammar. Okay. So

423
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:24,500
we're going this is barked barked.

424
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:33,200
Okay, you can you can fill this good. Yeah on this out off camera Juvio. You can do your

425
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:34,700
thing here. It doesn't matter.

426
00:19:34,700 --> 00:19:39,900
If you guys ever get a personal trainer, I feel like that's a I mean, I guess I would

427
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:45,700
if I needed to if I was a famous celebrity get healthy and I was really rich. Yeah, I

428
00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:49,900
wanted to do that. Or if I needed somebody to drug me and put me in an insane asylum,

429
00:19:49,900 --> 00:19:50,900
I might look for this specific guy.

430
00:19:50,900 --> 00:19:53,980
Yeah, I didn't realize that was part of the job description. You know, you ever in college

431
00:19:53,980 --> 00:19:57,480
and stuff, like you meet people who are like, "Oh yeah." I feel like I would meet so many

432
00:19:57,480 --> 00:20:01,580
people in college who would be like, "Yeah, I want to be like a sports scientist or like

433
00:20:01,580 --> 00:20:03,500
a personal trainer or something."

434
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:05,260
That's the craziest. That's job.

435
00:20:05,260 --> 00:20:08,780
That's like when you're, when it's the same as people going to school for nursing, I think,

436
00:20:08,780 --> 00:20:14,100
but for guys. And I just can't imagine what is fun about that job until I realized, "Well,

437
00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:16,420
Well, if you get to like fake people's deaths

438
00:20:16,420 --> 00:20:17,260
and fucking kill celebrities.

439
00:20:17,260 --> 00:20:18,180
- That's true, right?

440
00:20:18,180 --> 00:20:19,020
- Yeah.

441
00:20:19,020 --> 00:20:21,060
- With no regard for who you hurt.

442
00:20:21,060 --> 00:20:23,100
- If you can be on the news.

443
00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:24,020
- That's kind of awesome, right?

444
00:20:24,020 --> 00:20:24,860
- Yeah.

445
00:20:24,860 --> 00:20:26,460
Being on the news is kind of the ultimate goal.

446
00:20:26,460 --> 00:20:28,780
- Is there any other reason to become a celebrity doctor?

447
00:20:28,780 --> 00:20:30,580
Like why become a celebrity doctor if you're not?

448
00:20:30,580 --> 00:20:31,420
- You have to look at their penises.

449
00:20:31,420 --> 00:20:33,620
- Look at Dr. Drew.

450
00:20:33,620 --> 00:20:34,700
- Did he kill anyone?

451
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:35,540
- Yeah.

452
00:20:35,540 --> 00:20:36,380
- Who?

453
00:20:36,380 --> 00:20:37,520
- A lot of people.

454
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:42,120
Dr. Drew has over prescribed fentanyl

455
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:44,080
to so many people, I think.

456
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:47,180
- So people are, so he's writing prescriptions

457
00:20:47,180 --> 00:20:50,280
for normal fentanyl, but he's just given too much of it?

458
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:52,320
- I don't even know if that's true, what I said.

459
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:53,160
- I don't think-- - I don't even know

460
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:53,980
who Dr. Drew is. - I just made that up,

461
00:20:53,980 --> 00:20:55,720
I made that up, and I'm gonna run with it.

462
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:57,560
- Okay, that's fine. - Yeah, that works for me.

463
00:20:57,560 --> 00:21:00,400
- Dr. Drew is the one from "Love Line," though, right?

464
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:03,000
Is that the, okay, so Dr. Drew has--

465
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,600
- I love "Line." - He's actually just

466
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:08,840
given out so much real ass advice to struggling men.

467
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:10,240
- Yeah, that's not so wrong.

468
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:12,600
That isn't wrong at all.

469
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:13,680
He's the love doctor.

470
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:14,560
That's true.

471
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:16,520
Have you guys ever thought maybe we could do a love line

472
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:17,360
kind of thing?

473
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:18,180
Definitely.

474
00:21:18,180 --> 00:21:19,020
That would be--

475
00:21:19,020 --> 00:21:20,320
Actually, we will.

476
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:21,160
That's a good idea.

477
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:22,920
We should get a doctor in here.

478
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:25,180
(laughing)

479
00:21:25,180 --> 00:21:30,280
We should get like a 103 year old

480
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:32,480
like Long Island Jewish doctor,

481
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:33,800
like an old, old man,

482
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:36,320
and just ask him, get questions about like,

483
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:37,640
who should text first?

484
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:39,880
(laughing)

485
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:47,480
I met my girlfriend on Roblox.

486
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:52,480
Hey, I have these are yeah, these are some questions that we have from people who sent

487
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:53,840
in things.

488
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:56,440
My girl hasn't posted her be real today.

489
00:21:56,440 --> 00:22:00,880
Yesterday, I saw her be real with another guy.

490
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:01,880
What does this mean?

491
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:05,320
How do I tear the pussy up?

492
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:06,320
Just drooling.

493
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:08,320
He's just completely...

494
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:10,320
He's just asleep in a turkey sandwich.

495
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:13,320
What do you do when afterwards, the room stinks?

496
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:16,320
How do I get the stink out of my chest?

497
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:17,320
He would know how to do that.

498
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:19,320
Because you know, if you're living that long,

499
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:21,320
like the people who live in the 100s,

500
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:22,320
That's true, the stink gets worse.

501
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:24,320
They are so accustomed to the...

502
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:27,320
Like imagine when you beat it up so hard that the room stank,

503
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:30,320
but then plus you have the old person smell on top of that.

504
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:33,320
You have the old person smell because like the only thing your body can digest

505
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:34,320
is like cans of tuna.

506
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:35,320
Exactly.

507
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:38,840
cat food? Yeah, yeah. We should put, you know the

508
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:43,720
cat food? You know the cigarette hole? Is that a stoma? Is that what that's called?

509
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:47,880
They should put that in old people, all old people, and put one of those air

510
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:51,240
fresheners just in that hole all the time so whenever they breathe, they

511
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:54,960
breathe out the air freshener. It smells like chocolate. Yeah, well you could

512
00:22:54,960 --> 00:23:01,200
switch them out. You could customize your grandpa or grandma. Oh my god, I would love to customize my grandpa when he was alive.

513
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:04,680
If I have to, if I absolutely have to come up with a theory on the old people

514
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:08,980
smell thing, here's my guess, is that it that is what the world

515
00:23:08,980 --> 00:23:10,880
smelled like when they were coming up.

516
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:11,180
Okay.

517
00:23:11,180 --> 00:23:12,180
Yeah, right?

518
00:23:12,180 --> 00:23:12,480
Yeah.

519
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:14,380
They still wear all the same.

520
00:23:14,380 --> 00:23:14,780
The same.

521
00:23:14,780 --> 00:23:16,580
They're using the same ish.

522
00:23:16,580 --> 00:23:20,980
They're using the same ish that they're spraying.

523
00:23:20,980 --> 00:23:24,180
They're wearing the same ish, you know, and so I really

524
00:23:24,180 --> 00:23:26,280
I yeah, this smells like some old ass ish.

525
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:28,980
Yeah, so I'm thinking, you know, by the time we get.

526
00:23:28,980 --> 00:23:31,480
Jubia looked up, why do old people smell?

527
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:31,980
I don't want to actually know.

528
00:23:31,980 --> 00:23:33,280
And the answer is too not at all.

529
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:33,980
Yeah, this is uninteresting.

530
00:23:34,180 --> 00:23:36,020
- Yeah. - Two, not an all.

531
00:23:36,020 --> 00:23:37,460
- I don't wanna hear it. - It's uninteresting.

532
00:23:37,460 --> 00:23:38,540
- Turn it off. - Turn it off.

533
00:23:38,540 --> 00:23:40,460
- Turn it off, it's too boring.

534
00:23:40,460 --> 00:23:42,820
- I think that when we get older,

535
00:23:42,820 --> 00:23:44,580
our grandkids will be like-- - We're gonna smell it, yeah.

536
00:23:44,580 --> 00:23:45,940
- They're gonna walk in. - Why do you smell

537
00:23:45,940 --> 00:23:48,740
like the cool mint vape pod?

538
00:23:48,740 --> 00:23:50,580
- Yeah, exactly, why do you smell like a Juul?

539
00:23:50,580 --> 00:23:51,420
- Yeah. - Why do you smell

540
00:23:51,420 --> 00:23:53,900
like a phone battery? - Wait, pull that video up.

541
00:23:53,900 --> 00:23:56,460
Pull that video up. (laughs)

542
00:23:56,460 --> 00:23:58,700
- Don't pull the video. - No, we don't watch that.

543
00:23:58,700 --> 00:23:59,860
- No, we don't. - Just watch it

544
00:23:59,860 --> 00:24:00,700
on your own time, that's really cool.

545
00:24:00,700 --> 00:24:01,520
- All right. - Yeah.

546
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:02,360
- There's people who listen to this.

547
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:05,480
- We have this video thing that we can pull up whenever now.

548
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:07,320
- Oh, speaking of the video, everyone can see now.

549
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:09,760
I mean, I know I mentioned the first episode,

550
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:12,120
I was gonna use my clothes reconstruction machine

551
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:13,600
to build you guys back your old wardrobes,

552
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:15,720
'cause we are living in a post-apocalyptic world,

553
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:17,840
and we're kind of making up stories to amuse ourselves

554
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:19,680
about our daily lives. - Playing imaginary.

555
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:22,480
- Yeah, for the past 20-ish minutes.

556
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:24,280
But how do you guys like, I do,

557
00:24:24,280 --> 00:24:25,120
- You're talking about that ish?

558
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:27,320
- I like good-ish, but I hate bad-ish.

559
00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:31,080
But how are you guys, did anything strange happen

560
00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:33,660
- My shirt is inside out right now.

561
00:24:33,660 --> 00:24:35,760
- It's inside out, so oh, printed on the inside?

562
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:36,600
- Yeah.

563
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:39,040
- That sucks, 'cause I actually, I had a big mishap.

564
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:40,360
- What happened with you?

565
00:24:40,360 --> 00:24:42,440
- Well, there was, I guess, some kind of glitch

566
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:44,480
when I was trying to recreate my wardrobe.

567
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:46,920
And I mean, I'll just, this is all I have left now.

568
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:48,880
My only shirt. - Jesus Christ, what, are you okay?

569
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:54,040
Oh, God.

570
00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:56,240
Come on.

571
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:58,560
- This is the only shirt that I own now.

572
00:24:58,560 --> 00:24:59,880
There was some kind of, I think,

573
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:02,780
I think maybe a bug flew into the machine

574
00:25:02,780 --> 00:25:05,000
when I was printing my shirts.

575
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,480
- How would a bug cause that to be printing on your shirt?

576
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:09,320
- Yeah, what kind of printer did you use?

577
00:25:09,320 --> 00:25:11,000
- Well, it's a shirt creator,

578
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,560
kind of like a 3D, 4D printer.

579
00:25:13,560 --> 00:25:16,700
So either a fly or a beetle might have crawled into the,

580
00:25:16,700 --> 00:25:18,360
might have crawled into the printing.

581
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:19,800
- You know what it seems like,

582
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:21,840
based on what the shirt says,

583
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:24,320
it seems like Patrick maybe climbed into the printer.

584
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:26,720
- Oh, come on, that's not nice to Patrick.

585
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:28,360
I think it could have been a rat too,

586
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:29,720
I guess, went in there or something.

587
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:32,040
or a pervert who escaped from prison.

588
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:33,600
- Maybe somebody hacked my machine.

589
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:34,440
I really don't know what happened.

590
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:35,840
- Are you sure that wasn't just,

591
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:37,800
wait, do you do any kind of scanning?

592
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:39,040
Do you have to scan yourself in

593
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:40,320
for it to make your clothes or anything like that?

594
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:42,480
- No, I just wanna know how a mouse

595
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:44,400
getting into your printer would make your shirt

596
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:46,680
say pervert who escaped from prison.

597
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:48,820
- Well, I'm not really sure how it happened.

598
00:25:48,820 --> 00:25:51,220
I'm not like an engineer or a tech expert

599
00:25:51,220 --> 00:25:52,240
with these kinds of machines.

600
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:54,560
I think maybe a switch got flipped on on the back

601
00:25:54,560 --> 00:25:56,320
that changed the-- - Oh, oh, oh.

602
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:57,840
That originally, I think this--

603
00:25:57,840 --> 00:25:59,480
- Oh, you've got the prisoner printer.

604
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:03,980
Yeah, I think there was some kind of button I might have inadvertently pressed that made my shirt say this.

605
00:26:03,980 --> 00:26:04,980
Wow.

606
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:10,480
What I'm really hoping is that, I think if I walk around wearing this shirt, people are going to think it's a band logo, right?

607
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:11,480
Yeah.

608
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:12,480
It'll probably be fine, right?

609
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:15,480
Yeah, well if you put some tour dates on the back.

610
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:17,480
Well, so you guys think this shirt is bad right now.

611
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:26,480
So that's why I would love to do that to maybe salvage this shirt, but what is on the back of this shirt is actually far worse.

612
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:28,480
Let me see what's on the back.

613
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:30,480
What's on the back?

614
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:36,480
No.

615
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:38,480
Tell me that's not.

616
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:40,480
Come on. Are you fucking serious?

617
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:42,480
That is disgusting.

618
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:44,480
Scoot into the middle here.

619
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:48,480
If you agree with that, you're worse than a pervert who escaped from prison.

620
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:52,480
If you think that the way Squidward treats Spongebob is A-OK,

621
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:55,440
that you, I, personally, I think you should go to prison.

622
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:57,480
- And I didn't even notice that that was on the back

623
00:26:57,480 --> 00:26:58,800
of the shirt until I was wiping my butt

624
00:26:58,800 --> 00:26:59,960
in the mirror this morning.

625
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:00,800
- Oh, no.

626
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:06,160
I think that, all right, if we could,

627
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:08,800
if there's any way that we could maybe tape over

628
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:11,200
that stuff on the back and make it say, you know,

629
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:12,040
'cause then it'll just say,

630
00:27:12,040 --> 00:27:12,860
"Pervert who escaped from prison.

631
00:27:12,860 --> 00:27:14,240
"People will assume that's a band."

632
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:16,760
- Yeah, or a company's logo, my favorite restaurant.

633
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:17,640
- Yeah, something like that.

634
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:19,240
And then you put tour dates on the back.

635
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:20,080
- Yeah.

636
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:20,900
- Maybe, but, you know.

637
00:27:20,900 --> 00:27:21,740
- Maybe, yeah, like, it would say like--

638
00:27:21,740 --> 00:27:23,360
- House shows only, so you can just,

639
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:24,200
people's addresses on the back.

640
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:25,040
- People's, yeah, yeah.

641
00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:25,860
- Dates that you're gonna be there.

642
00:27:25,860 --> 00:27:27,140
- Addresses and dates, that's a good idea.

643
00:27:27,140 --> 00:27:28,820
- Yeah, it's not a bad idea.

644
00:27:28,820 --> 00:27:30,380
I do like that shirt.

645
00:27:30,380 --> 00:27:31,220
- Yeah, I think--

646
00:27:31,220 --> 00:27:32,060
- It's kind of, I'm warming up to it a little bit.

647
00:27:32,060 --> 00:27:33,060
- It's growing on you?

648
00:27:33,060 --> 00:27:33,900
- Yeah, it's pretty good.

649
00:27:33,900 --> 00:27:35,180
- Well, I'm gonna be wearing it every episode

650
00:27:35,180 --> 00:27:37,100
for the rest of time, 'cause the only shirt I have now--

651
00:27:37,100 --> 00:27:38,460
- The only shirt you have right now.

652
00:27:38,460 --> 00:27:40,700
- That's, that's, that's fucked up.

653
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:41,540
- It's pretty sad.

654
00:27:41,540 --> 00:27:42,820
- Yeah. - It is pretty sad.

655
00:27:42,820 --> 00:27:43,660
- I wish I, I mean--

656
00:27:43,660 --> 00:27:45,620
- I spent every last dollar I had printing this shirt.

657
00:27:45,620 --> 00:27:47,620
Really? You lost all your money?

658
00:27:47,620 --> 00:27:49,620
That's a billion dollar shirt. You can resell that.

659
00:27:49,620 --> 00:27:51,620
Damn, that's a good idea.

660
00:27:51,620 --> 00:27:53,620
Use Grailed. Oh my god.

661
00:27:53,620 --> 00:27:55,620
You get on Grailed and sell that shit. Say Cardi

662
00:27:55,620 --> 00:27:57,620
Playboy Cardi.

663
00:27:57,620 --> 00:27:59,620
True!

664
00:27:59,620 --> 00:28:01,620
Playboy Cardi inspired t-shirt.

665
00:28:01,620 --> 00:28:03,620
(laughter)

666
00:28:03,620 --> 00:28:07,620
Can you just list whatever you want on those websites?

667
00:28:07,620 --> 00:28:09,620
Oh yeah, I have a

668
00:28:09,620 --> 00:28:11,620
Bones Red sticker.

669
00:28:11,620 --> 00:28:13,620
This is on Grailed for $5,000.

670
00:28:13,620 --> 00:28:16,380
red sticker on grail for $300.

671
00:28:16,380 --> 00:28:17,380
Playboy Cardi inspired t-shirt.

672
00:28:17,380 --> 00:28:18,380
Yeah.

673
00:28:18,380 --> 00:28:20,220
It's not a bad idea.

674
00:28:20,220 --> 00:28:24,740
I saw somebody selling the cuffs of a pair of Polar Big Boys for $300.

675
00:28:24,740 --> 00:28:25,740
Why?

676
00:28:25,740 --> 00:28:27,620
It's a funny.

677
00:28:27,620 --> 00:28:28,620
It's a funny.

678
00:28:28,620 --> 00:28:29,620
It's a funny.

679
00:28:29,620 --> 00:28:30,620
It's a funny.

680
00:28:30,620 --> 00:28:31,620
It's a funny.

681
00:28:31,620 --> 00:28:33,020
You ever sell anything on Depop?

682
00:28:33,020 --> 00:28:34,020
No.

683
00:28:34,020 --> 00:28:36,060
I think that website and app is da poop.

684
00:28:36,060 --> 00:28:37,540
I think that thing sucks.

685
00:28:37,540 --> 00:28:38,540
I agree.

686
00:28:38,540 --> 00:28:39,540
Come on, pound that out.

687
00:28:39,540 --> 00:28:40,540
That's a good close on there.

688
00:28:40,540 --> 00:28:42,000
- Can we get a fist bump of Caleb?

689
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,800
We got a picture of Caleb fist bumping

690
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:45,280
somebody who's wearing the shirt?

691
00:28:45,280 --> 00:28:47,200
- Well, joke's on you, 'cause you're fist bumping

692
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:49,120
somebody who has the word skater on their shirt,

693
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:50,760
which I would say is a lot more damning.

694
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:51,600
- There's no way that I can hide.

695
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:53,440
- Get a close up on me with my shirt.

696
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:55,760
I support Barack Obama.

697
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:57,360
(laughing)

698
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:59,000
- Holy shit, I like that, that was good.

699
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,560
Wait, wait, wait, we can get you to say other things.

700
00:29:00,560 --> 00:29:01,760
- Yeah, I know, wait, wait.

701
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:04,160
- Let's see, we can destroy all of our enemies right now.

702
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:05,840
- Yeah, pervert who escaped from prison.

703
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:08,080
- Read a Brandon Wardell stand-up date right now.

704
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:10,880
(laughter)

705
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:13,480
- Pervert who escaped from prison says what?

706
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:14,480
What?

707
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:17,160
- Oh shit, you got, fuck!

708
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:18,000
Shit!

709
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,160
- Yeah, you're double, you got hit twice.

710
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:21,500
- Fuck, I don't need this right now.

711
00:29:21,500 --> 00:29:23,960
I don't need this right now.

712
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:26,640
I only have one shirt and I loved all my shirts.

713
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:28,900
(laughter)

714
00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:32,240
- Oh my god, wait, that is a sick--

715
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:34,440
- Wait, it stinks $300?

716
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:35,520
- Yep.

717
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:36,360
- Oh my god.

718
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:37,960
- Message this person right now.

719
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:41,800
Message them and say, "What the fuck is wrong with you?"

720
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:42,800
Do you think that's--

721
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:44,480
Continue with your Facebook, yeah.

722
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:48,360
No, don't click any of those buttons.

723
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:49,520
Don't click any of those buttons.

724
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:52,520
No, it's finding Senna for grilled with the business account.

725
00:29:52,520 --> 00:29:53,520
Not a big deal.

726
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:54,520
We'll just start.

727
00:29:54,520 --> 00:29:55,520
We'll move into that space.

728
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:56,520
We'll just start selling shirts for grilled.

729
00:29:56,520 --> 00:29:58,520
It's not a bad idea.

730
00:29:58,520 --> 00:30:01,760
Yeah, let's send this guy a message.

731
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:02,760
Pull up the--

732
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:03,760
What's your fucking deal?

733
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:04,760
No, no, no, no, no, no.

734
00:30:04,760 --> 00:30:05,760
Don't send that.

735
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:06,760
Don't send that.

736
00:30:06,760 --> 00:30:08,260
- Hold this up on screen.

737
00:30:08,260 --> 00:30:09,100
- Yeah, we need this on screen.

738
00:30:09,100 --> 00:30:10,260
- Put this up on screen.

739
00:30:10,260 --> 00:30:11,460
- People need to see this.

740
00:30:11,460 --> 00:30:12,940
Okay, so let's construct a message here.

741
00:30:12,940 --> 00:30:16,020
- All right, just here, here's my pitch for a message.

742
00:30:16,020 --> 00:30:17,260
- For the pervert jersey.

743
00:30:17,260 --> 00:30:19,420
- Short and simple, easy message.

744
00:30:19,420 --> 00:30:20,260
Just write.

745
00:30:20,260 --> 00:30:22,580
- Do you really support what this shirt says?

746
00:30:22,580 --> 00:30:24,340
- Write down just $10.

747
00:30:24,340 --> 00:30:26,780
Just $10, nothing else.

748
00:30:26,780 --> 00:30:29,460
- Can you support Barack Obama?

749
00:30:29,460 --> 00:30:31,580
- Oh, that's where that's from.

750
00:30:31,580 --> 00:30:33,540
Barack Obama was a walk-on at Harvard.

751
00:30:33,540 --> 00:30:34,380
- Oh.

752
00:30:36,060 --> 00:30:37,540
That was his jersey, I guess.

753
00:30:37,540 --> 00:30:39,700
- $10, all you said was $10?

754
00:30:39,700 --> 00:30:40,540
- Yeah.

755
00:30:40,540 --> 00:30:42,460
- This is gonna get the conversation moving.

756
00:30:42,460 --> 00:30:43,660
- The vintage Don.

757
00:30:43,660 --> 00:30:46,140
- Let's go back to more of these pervert shirts here.

758
00:30:46,140 --> 00:30:48,860
I think I saw, that is just a white shirt.

759
00:30:48,860 --> 00:30:49,700
- Wait, there's a bunch of pervert.

760
00:30:49,700 --> 00:30:53,500
- There's another vintage 90s pervert jersey for $2,000?

761
00:30:53,500 --> 00:30:54,340
What the hell is this?

762
00:30:54,340 --> 00:30:55,980
- What the hell was pervert?

763
00:30:55,980 --> 00:30:56,820
There's so many of them.

764
00:30:56,820 --> 00:30:57,740
- Pervert 69?

765
00:30:57,740 --> 00:31:00,900
- Was pervert a brand in like Japan or something?

766
00:31:00,900 --> 00:31:01,740
- I mean, it's this shit.

767
00:31:01,740 --> 00:31:03,340
- Japanese brand, yeah, right there.

768
00:31:03,340 --> 00:31:04,180
- Oh my God.

769
00:31:04,180 --> 00:31:05,000
- You're a genius.

770
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,880
- You're a brand genius. - Spins a thing of all time.

771
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:09,800
- Freak pervert. (laughs)

772
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:15,840
- $1.34.

773
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:16,680
- $1.34.

774
00:31:16,680 --> 00:31:20,400
- Freak pervert.

775
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:23,600
- This is how a businessman gets deals moving.

776
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:24,480
- I would wear that shirt.

777
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:25,320
That was a cool shirt.

778
00:31:25,320 --> 00:31:26,800
- I would wear any of these shirts

779
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:29,000
because I don't want to wear this one anymore.

780
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,800
- $900 for a pervert shirt.

781
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:33,600
Ask them for free.

782
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:35,840
(laughing)

783
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:40,180
- Man.

784
00:31:40,180 --> 00:31:42,280
- We'll have to check that out.

785
00:31:42,280 --> 00:31:43,120
- Yeah, wait, what's that red shirt down there?

786
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:45,620
- We'll have to all get some pervert jerseys.

787
00:31:45,620 --> 00:31:46,460
That says--

788
00:31:46,460 --> 00:31:50,280
- Pervert University, $333 angel number.

789
00:31:50,280 --> 00:31:52,080
- I'm not gonna go to Pervert University.

790
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:52,920
- All right, I've had--

791
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:53,760
- Message them and say-- - Yeah, close it.

792
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:55,640
- Santa could wear this.

793
00:31:55,640 --> 00:31:56,800
- No, 'cause it's red.

794
00:31:56,800 --> 00:31:58,280
Yeah, actually, yeah, you should message.

795
00:31:58,280 --> 00:31:59,680
Santa might be able to wear this.

796
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:01,600
- Santa might be able to wear this jersey for Christmas.

797
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:02,640
- Yeah, just write four.

798
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:09,000
Actually just send the number 4. Just do that. Yeah. Perfect. He does anything we say. He's

799
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:15,000
a robot. Artificial intelligence. He totally is. Vintage serial killer pervert. We're done.

800
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:21,520
Whoa, what the hell? Why are you on Trump? Trump3times.com? Do you guys think he's gonna

801
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:25,760
win? He's got to, right? Is he running again? I think he's definitely gonna run again. Oh,

802
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:29,600
he's running again. He's definitely gonna run, right? Why would you even run against

803
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:33,920
them. If you're the other guys on the thing, why would you even run?

804
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:35,480
Exactly. Here, I'll help him out too.

805
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:36,480
Who's running against him, Ron DeSantis?

806
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:40,920
Julio, give me a close up for a second. Donald Trump, I think you're unsavory.

807
00:32:40,920 --> 00:32:42,640
Oh, that sounds about right.

808
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:45,640
Yeah, so then people can put that on their @ political ads.

809
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:50,840
I do kind of feel like the skater thing is also a bit, like I can have some sway as well.

810
00:32:50,840 --> 00:32:52,840
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Here, you do something.

811
00:32:52,840 --> 00:32:54,720
Well, I don't want to say anything like that.

812
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:56,080
Say, "I want a skateboard."

813
00:32:56,080 --> 00:32:59,560
All right, I'll say, oh yeah, this one. Yeah, I want to skate right about now.

814
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:05,400
Okay. All right now Pat you do one. I don't have anything. You have a camo shirt on.

815
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:13,360
Yeah. I'm a tree! What? You're... I'm a bunch... I'm the woods. That's shit. You're the woods?

816
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:24,600
That's not... I don't know! I don't have any words! Skater could be... Wait hold on. Okay. Yeah. Remember this is

817
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:26,600
You're reflecting with your clothes.

818
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:28,600
Whatever you endorse.

819
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:30,600
People are going to be like, "A tree said that."

820
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:34,600
Cut down more of me.

821
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:36,600
No.

822
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:38,600
Yeah, you could say that.

823
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:40,600
Completely wipe me out.

824
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:42,600
Turn me into toilet paper.

825
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:44,600
One fly.

826
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:46,600
I don't really get why we care all that much about the Amazon and shit.

827
00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:48,600
Who gives a fuck?

828
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:50,600
It's because there's strange beasts that are there.

829
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:52,600
And if we cut down the trees, it drives them into civilization.

830
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:56,120
- That is not a nice thing to call those people

831
00:33:56,120 --> 00:33:56,960
who've never seen the computer.

832
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:57,780
- I'm talking about dinosaurs,

833
00:33:57,780 --> 00:34:01,720
I'm talking about demons and bat-winged apes.

834
00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:02,800
- Bat-winged duck.

835
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:04,520
- There's apes with bat-wings?

836
00:34:04,520 --> 00:34:07,120
- Yeah, orang-batty, Google, I don't know,

837
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:08,760
I think that's actually not in the Amazon,

838
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:11,440
but check this out, just orang, like orangutan,

839
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:16,040
O-R-A-N-G space B-A-T-I,

840
00:34:16,040 --> 00:34:17,920
and go to Google Images or Bing Images.

841
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:19,480
- Orange-bati?

842
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:21,920
- Now go to the images, check this thing out.

843
00:34:21,920 --> 00:34:22,420
Okay.

844
00:34:22,420 --> 00:34:22,920
Holy shit.

845
00:34:22,920 --> 00:34:23,420
Oh, I've seen that.

846
00:34:23,420 --> 00:34:26,420
And this thing is real and I forget where it lives, but it's real.

847
00:34:26,420 --> 00:34:28,420
Yeah, it lives on Searam Island.

848
00:34:28,420 --> 00:34:28,920
It lives in Bushwick.

849
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:29,420
Indonesia.

850
00:34:29,420 --> 00:34:29,920
I've seen this.

851
00:34:29,920 --> 00:34:30,920
This is an Indonesian animal.

852
00:34:30,920 --> 00:34:32,420
That is just abnormal bad buddy.

853
00:34:32,420 --> 00:34:33,920
Well, that's a, yeah, don't click on that one.

854
00:34:33,920 --> 00:34:35,420
Click on the, one of the actual ones.

855
00:34:35,420 --> 00:34:36,420
This was in my neighborhood last week.

856
00:34:36,420 --> 00:34:37,420
One of the real ones.

857
00:34:37,420 --> 00:34:39,420
Yeah, like the one right to the right of it is one of the real ones.

858
00:34:39,420 --> 00:34:41,420
Yeah, I saw this at Burger King.

859
00:34:41,420 --> 00:34:43,420
You did not, because it lives in Indonesia.

860
00:34:43,420 --> 00:34:44,420
It was visiting.

861
00:34:44,420 --> 00:34:47,420
And so that's how, stuff like this is in the Amazon River basin.

862
00:34:47,420 --> 00:34:47,920
It has wings.

863
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:48,420
It can go anywhere.

864
00:34:48,420 --> 00:34:48,920
We're cutting down the trees.

865
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:52,960
they're gonna fly over to us. God knows what they do to us. Did you guys know that

866
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:58,000
you that in Singapore there's no there's almost no crime? I learned that this week.

867
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:01,240
Because they're not allowed to chew gum. That was yeah there's all these gum

868
00:35:01,240 --> 00:35:04,160
chewing that makes people criminals. If you like trip if you don't tie your

869
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:07,900
shoelaces you go to jail for like 20 years. Yeah. So just everything people

870
00:35:07,900 --> 00:35:12,160
just like we'll see money on the ground and be like nah. Yeah. You're not allowed to

871
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:15,000
pick up money off the ground in Singapore? No you'll go to jail for that.

872
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:20,120
of what your hands off in your head to pretty cool I'm looking at something

873
00:35:20,120 --> 00:35:24,720
there is crime in Singapore and that is no three sources no there's this year

874
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:29,840
there have been a slew of ghastly crimes in Singapore I guess I mean I think

875
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:32,800
we're gonna gasp anyone no this doesn't make any sense I saw a YouTube video

876
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:36,440
said there's almost no crime there it makes sense there there would be a bunch

877
00:35:36,440 --> 00:35:40,360
of if you weren't allowed to chew gum or eat lollipop that drive you to fucking

878
00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:45,760
murder yeah yeah I said if I went to this country and they said you can't eat

879
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:55,400
candy yeah I gotta have my five gum gotta have my candy yeah yeah what else

880
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:59,700

881
00:35:59,700 --> 00:36:05,440
normal yeah even in the gym no come to the gym with me I would I have to I have

882
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:12,000
I have to start working on my arms because I saw a photo of myself skating and my arms

883
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,840
are so... no one told me my arms were this small.

884
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:16,360
Do you think you have small arms?

885
00:36:16,360 --> 00:36:17,360
Do you see that?

886
00:36:17,360 --> 00:36:18,360
Give me one of these.

887
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:19,360
Let me look on the camera.

888
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:22,180
That's a completely normal sized arm.

889
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:23,180
Look at my arm.

890
00:36:23,180 --> 00:36:24,180
Look at this though.

891
00:36:24,180 --> 00:36:26,900
Look at my little arm.

892
00:36:26,900 --> 00:36:27,900
What do you mean look at this?

893
00:36:27,900 --> 00:36:28,900
You see that?

894
00:36:28,900 --> 00:36:30,800
You're a weird double jointed kid from school.

895
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:33,520
Oh fuck you.

896
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:34,760
- You can't claim you have small arms

897
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:35,600
and you sit next to me.

898
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:37,960
It doesn't, even if you do, I just have small arms.

899
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:41,360
- One time I saw a kid do this thing or whatever,

900
00:36:41,360 --> 00:36:44,200
do like the, yeah, like that when I was in middle school

901
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:45,880
and I like vomited in my mouth.

902
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:46,720
It was like the most, I've never seen anyone do that.

903
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:49,200
- Sometimes the first time you see that it's really bad.

904
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:51,480
- Double jointed people are like, should be put down.

905
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:52,320
That is fucking disgusting.

906
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:53,240
- I'm double jointed.

907
00:36:53,240 --> 00:36:55,920
- You are, I would say, the number one rule,

908
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:58,040
the number one proof that the rule is

909
00:36:58,040 --> 00:36:58,860
you should be put down

910
00:36:58,860 --> 00:37:00,360
'cause you have too many joints going on.

911
00:37:00,360 --> 00:37:01,640
- I do, it hurts a lot.

912
00:37:01,640 --> 00:37:04,680
I wish I had normal joints.

913
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:09,480
I wish I had that normal joint smoking on that normal pack.

914
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:11,680
I should get an opiates.

915
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:14,000
Have you ever done any kind of opioid?

916
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:14,920
I think.

917
00:37:14,920 --> 00:37:16,400
You think?

918
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:18,000
I think you would know.

919
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,600
They're pretty strong.

920
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:20,080
Yeah.

921
00:37:20,080 --> 00:37:22,160
I think maybe after a surgery when I was a kid.

922
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:24,160
I think someone put opium in my beer.

923
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:25,760
I think someone put opium in my beer.

924
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:27,680
Somebody slipped some raw opium right into it.

925
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:29,760
Yeah, because I threw up when I drank too much of it.

926
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:31,880
I would love to do the opium tea thing.

927
00:37:31,880 --> 00:37:32,720
Yeah.

928
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:33,560
Yeah.

929
00:37:33,560 --> 00:37:34,880
We should open an opium den.

930
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:37,800
I don't think I could ever do a downer though.

931
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:39,320
I'm not a downers guy.

932
00:37:39,320 --> 00:37:40,160
No?

933
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:40,980
No.

934
00:37:40,980 --> 00:37:42,160
You hate alcohol.

935
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:44,280
Beer is not a downer, beer gets me up.

936
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:48,480
I guess you're right, yeah.

937
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:49,320
Yeah.

938
00:37:49,320 --> 00:37:51,060
You see what I do on beer.

939
00:37:51,060 --> 00:37:53,080
He does some fucked up shit on beer.

940
00:37:53,080 --> 00:37:53,920
Yeah.

941
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:54,760
Some really bad stuff.

942
00:37:54,760 --> 00:37:55,880
Yeah, not nice stuff.

943
00:37:55,880 --> 00:37:58,120
Car wheels, he starts eating trash,

944
00:37:58,120 --> 00:38:00,360
He's throwing things at, he's scaring people.

945
00:38:00,360 --> 00:38:01,200
Yeah.

946
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:02,880
Yeah, you're a scary person on beer.

947
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:03,720
You are.

948
00:38:03,720 --> 00:38:05,880
'Cause you have no control over yourself and your body.

949
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:07,680
And you'll fucking do whatever you want.

950
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:08,520
Yeah.

951
00:38:08,520 --> 00:38:09,360
Yeah, I did--

952
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:10,560
Very scary on beer.

953
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:15,560
In Boston, I threw a thing of cheese balls at a cop car.

954
00:38:15,560 --> 00:38:17,200
No.

955
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:18,020
No way, dude.

956
00:38:18,020 --> 00:38:18,960
Cheese balls?

957
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:19,800
I took--

958
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:21,080
So did the cop car blow up?

959
00:38:21,080 --> 00:38:22,320
It was on the 4th of July.

960
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:24,280
Did it burst into flames?

961
00:38:24,280 --> 00:38:25,360
I took a thing of cheese balls--

962
00:38:25,360 --> 00:38:26,360
How old were you?

963
00:38:26,360 --> 00:38:27,720
Off the ground.

964
00:38:27,720 --> 00:38:28,780
- I'll agree with you. - It's like 19.

965
00:38:28,780 --> 00:38:29,960
- Oh my God. - Damn.

966
00:38:29,960 --> 00:38:31,340
- 19? - And you're drinking?

967
00:38:31,340 --> 00:38:32,940
- You wait, you were drinking as well?

968
00:38:32,940 --> 00:38:33,780
- Yeah.

969
00:38:33,780 --> 00:38:34,720
- Dude, this is one of the craziest

970
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:36,140
fucking stories I've ever heard.

971
00:38:36,140 --> 00:38:36,980
Did you--

972
00:38:36,980 --> 00:38:39,260
- Tell me you were not having a sleepover beforehand.

973
00:38:39,260 --> 00:38:41,580
- And I was having a sleepover at night.

974
00:38:41,580 --> 00:38:44,040
- Okay, but tell me this much, all right?

975
00:38:44,040 --> 00:38:44,880
Tell me that you were--

976
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:46,320
- And you're not gonna like whatever this next answer is.

977
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:47,980
- Tell me you were home by 9 p.m.

978
00:38:47,980 --> 00:38:50,720
- Buddy, it was 10.

979
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:54,000
- Dude, you were out that late at the witch's hour?

980
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:57,040
- And I threw a thing of Utz cheese balls--

981
00:38:57,040 --> 00:38:58,540
- What?

982
00:38:58,540 --> 00:38:59,700
A name brand one?

983
00:38:59,700 --> 00:39:00,860
You're wasting money.

984
00:39:00,860 --> 00:39:01,700
- Yep.

985
00:39:01,700 --> 00:39:03,040
- You didn't even get the groceries--

986
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:04,820
- Tell me you picked them up and ate them afterwards.

987
00:39:04,820 --> 00:39:06,520
- That I took from the ground.

988
00:39:06,520 --> 00:39:07,520
- No.

989
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:08,360
They could have been somebody.

990
00:39:08,360 --> 00:39:09,200
- They were fucking disgusting probably.

991
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:11,340
- And I was giving them out to people.

992
00:39:11,340 --> 00:39:13,260
- God, and telling them that they were from the ground.

993
00:39:13,260 --> 00:39:14,100
- For free?

994
00:39:14,100 --> 00:39:14,920
- And for free.

995
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:17,340
- Charitableness?

996
00:39:17,340 --> 00:39:18,340
Oh.

997
00:39:18,340 --> 00:39:20,820
- Yep.

998
00:39:20,820 --> 00:39:21,660
- And tell me that you weren't--

999
00:39:21,660 --> 00:39:22,780
- And I only had one beer.

1000
00:39:22,780 --> 00:39:23,620
- But at least--

1001
00:39:23,620 --> 00:39:25,340
- And tell me you didn't murder anybody right after.

1002
00:39:25,340 --> 00:39:26,380
- I killed a cop.

1003
00:39:26,380 --> 00:39:30,880
Oh my god, that's crazy. But tell me that you weren't living in sin with a woman at the time.

1004
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:31,880
I was.

1005
00:39:31,880 --> 00:39:32,880
I'm done.

1006
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:33,880
Mm-hmm.

1007
00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:40,440
Yeah, here's me with my skater shirt on. I think it's okay for people to move in together

1008
00:39:40,440 --> 00:39:46,880
even before they're married. Especially people who love each other. I think that's okay.

1009
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:48,380
Yeah. Hey, okay, now me.

1010
00:39:48,380 --> 00:39:49,380
It's okay for...

1011
00:39:49,380 --> 00:39:50,380
Okay, now me.

1012
00:39:50,380 --> 00:39:51,380
Yeah.

1013
00:39:51,380 --> 00:39:52,380
I think it's okay for women to be loose.

1014
00:39:52,380 --> 00:39:53,620
Oh yeah, that's good.

1015
00:39:53,620 --> 00:39:57,220
I guess yeah, if a pervert who escaped from prison would probably love a loose woman.

1016
00:39:57,220 --> 00:39:58,720
I think that having...

1017
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:03,260
Okay, so now the skater's saying this, the guy with the skater shirt, so people can cut

1018
00:40:03,260 --> 00:40:04,980
this out of context.

1019
00:40:04,980 --> 00:40:10,020
It's fine if you see a woman's belly button, and she shouldn't be in jail for that, honestly.

1020
00:40:10,020 --> 00:40:11,580
And then now me.

1021
00:40:11,580 --> 00:40:15,020
I should be in jail for what I did when I saw a woman's belly button.

1022
00:40:15,020 --> 00:40:16,900
Okay, now go to me.

1023
00:40:16,900 --> 00:40:20,500
They printed the Declaration of Independence on what I made.

1024
00:40:20,500 --> 00:40:21,500
Oh, yeah.

1025
00:40:21,500 --> 00:40:23,500
Oh, because you're the tree.

1026
00:40:23,500 --> 00:40:26,620
I don't think the tree thing sells that well because you have a human head.

1027
00:40:26,620 --> 00:40:32,460
And then maybe back to me. I wrote the Declaration of Independence.

1028
00:40:32,460 --> 00:40:37,420
That is honestly kind of fucking awesome. That is honestly a little bit fucking awesome that

1029
00:40:37,420 --> 00:40:41,260
you're a pervert who escaped from prison. Because a lot of those guys, people don't

1030
00:40:41,260 --> 00:40:43,380
get that. A lot of Tom Quincy Jones.

1031
00:40:43,380 --> 00:40:45,380
Do I look more like a tree now?

1032
00:40:45,380 --> 00:40:47,500
Quincy Jones. Oh, you actually do kind of blend in here.

1033
00:40:47,500 --> 00:40:48,500
Quincy Jones.

1034
00:40:48,500 --> 00:40:49,500
Let me say a tree thing.

1035
00:40:49,500 --> 00:40:50,500
Rashida Jones. Tom Adams.

1036
00:40:50,500 --> 00:40:51,500
Tom Adams.

1037
00:40:51,500 --> 00:40:58,520
Adams, Tom Atkins, these people were kind of perverts. A lot of them had sexual

1038
00:40:58,520 --> 00:41:02,960
escapades that they don't tell you about exactly in the fourth grade homework.

1039
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:08,060
Cut to me real quick. I don't think this is the machinist's journal. And it's okay to

1040
00:41:08,060 --> 00:41:15,300
print cigarettes onto me. That's true. That's true too. Yeah, that's good to give

1041
00:41:15,300 --> 00:41:24,740
cigarettes to kids. Chuck Schumer I'm voting for your ass motherfucker. Chuck Schumer and

1042
00:41:24,740 --> 00:41:33,220
your sister Amy? Yeah. My favorite motherfuckas. Rashida Tlaib you're a you're based. I'll

1043
00:41:33,220 --> 00:41:39,740
say it. You're a based asshole. You know who's based as hell? Wait. I I I hey hey I support

1044
00:41:39,740 --> 00:41:46,180
High fructose corn syrup ism. You know, yeah based Paul Bunyan. Yeah cut down a bunch of my cousins

1045
00:41:46,180 --> 00:41:50,980
Okay, I think you're missing the point of this whole thing a little yeah, it's supposed to be political

1046
00:41:50,980 --> 00:41:54,820
You're trying to be a little political a little edgy. It's like hey we a

1047
00:41:54,820 --> 00:42:00,880
Nancy Pelosi years your fucking husband is straight as an arrow and he's never had any kind of

1048
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:06,180
Homosexual prostitute in his house your big fake breasts. Give me wood

1049
00:42:07,220 --> 00:42:14,740
Why would a why would a tree have yet what it would already have wood the whole things would yeah, he would he would

1050
00:42:14,740 --> 00:42:17,820
See at least you could have maybe done some wordplay would

1051
00:42:17,820 --> 00:42:24,080
All right, you're going back I think as well as maybe yeah, maybe we leave the politics stuff

1052
00:42:24,080 --> 00:42:26,320
I'm gonna do something like this where it's like

1053
00:42:26,320 --> 00:42:29,180
like and I

1054
00:42:29,180 --> 00:42:34,120

And maybe beforehand.

1073
00:42:58,200 --> 00:42:59,040
And now--

1074
00:42:59,040 --> 00:43:00,600
What's before a tree, like just carbon?

1075
00:43:00,600 --> 00:43:01,440
Yeah, dirt.

1076
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:02,280

00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:10,160
and then what

1080
00:43:10,160 --> 00:43:15,080
but i'm gonna be a tree someday. A thread on the shirt got stuck to my hat

1081
00:43:15,080 --> 00:43:17,120
i'm sorry. That's sad

1082
00:43:17,120 --> 00:43:21,980
i think it's okay to wear hats

1083
00:43:21,980 --> 00:43:24,080
damn, hide your true head

1084
00:43:24,080 --> 00:43:25,360
i'll take my

1085
00:43:25,360 --> 00:43:27,280
i'll take my hat off, i'll show my damn

1086
00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:32,000
real head. I can't take my hat off because it's under my headphones. Speaking of Nancy Pelosi, I wish she'd do this

1087
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:40,200
with her blouse. Take off her blouse. She is kind of hot for a really old lady.

1088
00:43:40,200 --> 00:43:44,200
She's gotta be in the top 2% for 80 something year olds.

1089
00:43:44,200 --> 00:43:48,960
Who else is even in that weight class? Helen Mirren, is she 80?

1090
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:56,240
She's not 80. She's gotta be like 300. She's not 300. Nobody's 300.

1091
00:43:56,240 --> 00:44:01,040
Nobody's lived to be 300 except maybe Methuselah. What about

1092
00:44:01,040 --> 00:44:05,640
all the people born on Double Day. Double Day? I've never heard of that but I... It's like

1093
00:44:05,640 --> 00:44:10,520
Leap Day. It's like Leap Day but you double it. You double the leap or you double the

1094
00:44:10,520 --> 00:44:13,400
years that they were born? You double the leap. Well because Leap Day is... So it's

1095
00:44:13,400 --> 00:44:17,840
8 years? Yeah. Every 8 years? So you add 8 years to your age. So they would live to be

1096
00:44:17,840 --> 00:44:23,560
like 3. So this person is 8 times 300? No it's... Because they only turn... No it would

1097
00:44:23,560 --> 00:44:28,160
be divided by 8. They're 300 because it's 8 times... No but they only turn 1 year older

1098
00:44:28,160 --> 00:44:36,080
every 8 years. So you go, it's double day, it's just like getting the daily double in

1099
00:44:36,080 --> 00:44:46,120
jeopardy, right? So it's like, oh I'm 10 years old, 10 times 8, I'm 80. What? And what does

1100
00:44:46,120 --> 00:44:49,720
the day have to do with it? Because that's when they were born, on double day. Which

1101
00:44:49,720 --> 00:45:00,060
today is double day. June 20th. Okay, Google people born on June 20th. And it happens because

1102
00:45:00,060 --> 00:45:07,320
it's the day before the summer solstice. People born on. We should check our, you guys ever

1103
00:45:07,320 --> 00:45:14,240
check your, your, your birthday? Your, what's it called? Your, uh, Nicole Kidman, double

1104
00:45:14,240 --> 00:45:19,560
day birthday. Oh, so she's old. She's old. Double day birthday. That makes sense. Errol Flynn

1105
00:45:19,560 --> 00:45:23,360
makes sense. I don't even know who that is. I would have figured. Looks old. Brian Wilson.

1106
00:45:23,360 --> 00:45:28,120
John Goodman. Double day. See what I mean? All these people look like they could be 300

1107
00:45:28,120 --> 00:45:34,280
years old. Martin Lando definitely roots us as an old guy. Olympia Dukakis. That's a 300

1108
00:45:34,280 --> 00:45:40,280
year old if I've ever seen one. All right. Well, you've kind of-- Tika Sumter. Chad Atkins.

1109
00:45:40,280 --> 00:45:45,840
convinced me okay? Well Robert Rodriguez, Mike Berbiglia, holy shit. Yeah that guy is

1110
00:45:45,840 --> 00:45:50,520
not aging well. That is a 300 year old man. We should start doing some Mike

1111
00:45:50,520 --> 00:45:54,240
Berbiglia style one-man shows. I've always wanted a one-man show. We could

1112
00:45:54,240 --> 00:45:59,360
hit pause right now, move the desk, and then just have us stand in the

1113
00:45:59,360 --> 00:46:03,320
middle. If you did a one-man show what would you say it was about? What would

1114
00:46:03,320 --> 00:46:09,640
your one-man show be about? Probably just me saying I'm tired. I'm tired of all

1115
00:46:09,640 --> 00:46:15,320
of shit. Like what shit would you be tired about? That I have to be here. At the

1116
00:46:15,320 --> 00:46:19,400
one-man show? Yeah. You'd be pissed off. I don't want to do this! That's a good angle for a

1117
00:46:19,400 --> 00:46:24,520
one-man show. It would be called like, "So I have to do this bullshit."

1118
00:46:24,520 --> 00:46:29,320
Yeah. And it opens up. This shit sucks. So I guess I was fucking born on the 4th of July.

1119
00:46:29,320 --> 00:46:33,160
It would open like you're fully into it, and then there would be a

1120
00:46:33,160 --> 00:46:36,520
moment where all the lights turn on, and you go, "Do I really have to keep doing

1121
00:46:36,520 --> 00:46:39,920
this and then that's the audience would you also wouldn't market it like that

1122
00:46:39,920 --> 00:46:46,040
that's how you get the top reviews you market it as the fall of sir Doran yeah

1123
00:46:46,040 --> 00:46:49,600
and you're dressing in a knight costume yeah and you're doing that and then and

1124
00:46:49,600 --> 00:46:53,480
everyone's like I can't wait to see this fantasy one-man show one minute in you

1125
00:46:53,480 --> 00:46:56,200
take the night helmet off all the lights go up you say I'm tired I have a stomach

1126
00:46:56,200 --> 00:47:01,520
ache and I want to go home they go okay then leave somebody friend the crowd go

1127
00:47:01,520 --> 00:47:05,280
to this leave the show yeah don't get me a Red Bull and then come back bring the

1128
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:11,440
green bitch from Wicked. I saw Wicked a couple months ago. Yeah. It was awesome.

1129
00:47:11,440 --> 00:47:16,100
That's a, your mom's in town, you got to do something. You gotta see Wicked with

1130
00:47:16,100 --> 00:47:22,440
mama. Mama loves Wicked. Yep. Wicked's the one about the witch from the

1131
00:47:22,440 --> 00:47:30,000
West. Yep, the West Coast witch. Uh-huh. Yeah. And she's cruising in a six-fo.

1132
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:34,920
Wicked Moms Club. What is this movie? It's a broom I think. The Wicked Moms Club.

1133
00:47:34,920 --> 00:47:39,160
See in New England this would have a different meaning. Yeah he's got Wicked

1134
00:47:39,160 --> 00:47:43,280
Mom, Wicked Hot. Yeah. Pound that out. No Patrick come on.

1135
00:47:43,280 --> 00:47:46,960
Can I have a pound? All right I'll pound that out. Thank you. See in the other

1136
00:47:46,960 --> 00:47:50,880
parts of the world wicked does not mean the same thing. Yeah you go

1137
00:47:50,880 --> 00:47:54,600
into India and say wicked they're like that's not even a word in our language. Yeah we don't

1138
00:47:54,600 --> 00:47:58,200
know. Wicked is not. Wicked. It could be but it could mean something else. Is that your name?

1139
00:47:58,200 --> 00:48:00,200
I guess that's your name, Wicked.

1140
00:48:00,200 --> 00:48:02,200
Wicked.

1141
00:48:02,200 --> 00:48:04,200
Honestly, you're kind of just tricking them into giving you a cool nickname.

1142
00:48:04,200 --> 00:48:06,200
You going to China or any of those places?

1143
00:48:06,200 --> 00:48:08,200
Wicked would be a cool nickname.

1144
00:48:08,200 --> 00:48:10,200
Wicked?

1145
00:48:10,200 --> 00:48:12,200
Can my nickname be Wicked?

1146
00:48:12,200 --> 00:48:14,200
Wicked?

1147
00:48:14,200 --> 00:48:16,200
I don't know what that is.

1148
00:48:16,200 --> 00:48:18,200
He looks like Wicked Warwick.

1149
00:48:18,200 --> 00:48:20,200
I've never seen somebody miss a fist bump that bad.

1150
00:48:20,200 --> 00:48:22,200
You aligned it and then you just went right under it.

1151
00:48:22,200 --> 00:48:24,200
You moved your hand.

1152
00:48:24,200 --> 00:48:26,200
We have video evidence of you moving your hand.

1153
00:48:26,200 --> 00:48:30,280
that we're gonna do a slow motion we'll put in a slow motion right here like

1154
00:48:30,280 --> 00:48:34,560
wipeout I'm just an instant replay of you messing that up so bad. Oh we should build a wipeout course.

1155
00:48:34,560 --> 00:48:38,080
That's something I would love to do they brought back wipeout you know this?

1156
00:48:38,080 --> 00:48:41,880
They brought it back? They brought back wipeout and there's but there's way less

1157
00:48:41,880 --> 00:48:46,320
fat people yeah there's way what they were like okay the fat stuff is probably

1158
00:48:46,320 --> 00:48:50,120
a little bit too mean. Too much water splashing everywhere we have to hold the

1159
00:48:50,120 --> 00:48:55,560
costs a little tighter. Oh my god and there's mermaids on the show?

1160
00:48:55,560 --> 00:49:00,840
And Nicole Byer. I love Nicole Byer. Yeah. Nailed it. What a great show. Mm-hmm.

1161
00:49:00,840 --> 00:49:05,720
Some people might say that that show... Some people might say that show

1162
00:49:05,720 --> 00:49:09,760
ended right before something really good was gonna happen to that show and then

1163
00:49:09,760 --> 00:49:13,320
it was a pretty abruptly ended. You can probably talk about that, right? Yeah. I don't know.

1164
00:49:13,320 --> 00:49:20,400
I don't remember if I don't think I signed anything. Yeah, fuck 'em then.

1165
00:49:20,400 --> 00:49:25,400
Cameron was almost, he was pretty close to being unnailed at one point.

1166
00:49:25,400 --> 00:49:30,400
And he made me... I can't believe we've never talked about this.

1167
00:49:30,400 --> 00:49:34,400
Somebody reached out to him and was like, "I'm gonna put you unnailed it."

1168
00:49:34,400 --> 00:49:40,400
And he made me come over to his house and film him making, gotta be the worst cookies ever.

1169
00:49:40,400 --> 00:49:42,400
I think it was brownies.

1170
00:49:42,400 --> 00:49:44,400
Brownies. We have to release that.

1171
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:45,400
I'll see if I find it.

1172
00:49:45,400 --> 00:49:46,400
We still have it. We have to release it.

1173
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:47,400
It's embarrassing.

1174
00:49:47,400 --> 00:49:49,720
- Oh, you're the worst cook ever, dude.

1175
00:49:49,720 --> 00:49:50,840
It was crazy.

1176
00:49:50,840 --> 00:49:54,960
Or baker, I'm sure you can make a damn good pasta.

1177
00:49:54,960 --> 00:49:55,800
- Oh yeah.

1178
00:49:55,800 --> 00:49:56,640
- Yeah.

1179
00:49:56,640 --> 00:49:57,640
- You can make some pasta agio.

1180
00:49:57,640 --> 00:50:00,440
- And then you put icing on the brownies or something.

1181
00:50:00,440 --> 00:50:02,080
- Yeah, 'cause it needs to have more components.

1182
00:50:02,080 --> 00:50:03,940
It was like, it needs to, you need to show off

1183
00:50:03,940 --> 00:50:04,940
that you need to have.

1184
00:50:04,940 --> 00:50:06,800
(laughing)

1185
00:50:06,800 --> 00:50:08,000
- It was so crazy.

1186
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:09,160
And we were like, yeah, it's a sure thing.

1187
00:50:09,160 --> 00:50:10,280
You're gonna be able to nail it.

1188
00:50:10,280 --> 00:50:11,120
- It was close.

1189
00:50:11,120 --> 00:50:13,520
- What happened, they, you did that, or they got canceled?

1190
00:50:13,520 --> 00:50:14,960
- They ghosted me, and then I found out

1191
00:50:14,960 --> 00:50:17,360
that they got canceled like immediately after.

1192
00:50:17,360 --> 00:50:22,040
pretty sad so but i did that i did the interviews that it was pretty close

1193
00:50:22,040 --> 00:50:24,760
that would be a little bit of the interview you did the interview and

1194
00:50:24,760 --> 00:50:26,040
because what you nailed it

1195
00:50:26,040 --> 00:50:29,640
that's right what was your i'm curious if you had gotten on the show what would

1196
00:50:29,640 --> 00:50:33,080
your thing it would have been like in that that we've been like

1197
00:50:33,080 --> 00:50:37,080
all that's the other thing uh... is that

1198
00:50:37,080 --> 00:50:40,440
uh...

1199
00:50:40,440 --> 00:50:46,160
i guess i could talk about it and i remember it

1200
00:50:46,160 --> 00:50:48,160
I forgot about that!

1201
00:50:48,160 --> 00:50:50,160
So the person who told me that...

1202
00:50:50,160 --> 00:50:52,160
*laughter*

1203
00:50:52,160 --> 00:50:54,160
Sucks that this never happened to you.

1204
00:50:54,160 --> 00:50:56,160
Oh dude, I want to see it.

1205
00:50:56,160 --> 00:50:58,160
Yeah, I wish that it's gonna happen someday.

1206
00:50:58,160 --> 00:51:00,160
I will be on a cooking show.

1207
00:51:00,160 --> 00:51:02,160
You know what'll suck?

1208
00:51:02,160 --> 00:51:04,160
They bring back Nailed It!

1209
00:51:04,160 --> 00:51:06,160
and then this is on the podcast now.

1210
00:51:06,160 --> 00:51:08,160
But it's behind a paywall.

1211
00:51:08,160 --> 00:51:10,160
It's fine, they're never...

1212
00:51:10,160 --> 00:51:12,160
No one is going to leak this.

1213
00:51:12,160 --> 00:51:14,160
The person who reached out to me

1214
00:51:14,160 --> 00:51:22,020
then said that I should audition for Nailed It, told me that they were doing a tie-in

1215
00:51:22,020 --> 00:51:25,080
for the next season with a bunch of Netflix shows that were coming out with new seasons

1216
00:51:25,080 --> 00:51:29,440
at the time of that new season. And one of them was Cobra Kai. And they said that they

1217
00:51:29,440 --> 00:51:35,040
have people locked down for a bunch of other times. They have like a The Witcher fan who

1218
00:51:35,040 --> 00:51:38,400
would like audition or whatever. And they're like, "But nobody who's auditioned is a fan

1219
00:51:38,400 --> 00:51:42,880
of Cobra Kai. So I just had to say in my audition that I'm a huge

1220
00:51:42,880 --> 00:51:44,000
fan of Cobra Kai.

1221
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:51,720
And I watched I watched most of Cobra Kai just just in case dude

1222
00:51:51,720 --> 00:51:54,360
maybe that was never because that's a thing they would never

1223
00:51:54,360 --> 00:51:56,560
ask a question like I'd be like I'm a huge fan of Cobra Kai and

1224
00:51:56,560 --> 00:51:58,960
they'd be like, who's your favorite character and I can like

1225
00:51:58,960 --> 00:52:01,680
you know, pull up IMDb or whatever. But on the off like I

1226
00:52:01,680 --> 00:52:04,440
know there's no on the off universe where they ask like a

1227
00:52:04,440 --> 00:52:09,720
plot detail or something, but if it was between... if that was the

1228
00:52:09,720 --> 00:52:12,520
thing that stopped me from being on Nailed It, I would kill myself.

1229
00:52:12,520 --> 00:52:16,520
Yeah, well that would have been so funny because obviously nobody's a

1230
00:52:16,520 --> 00:52:18,680
fan of Cobra Kai. So when they say...

1231
00:52:18,680 --> 00:52:23,000
Well, hey, my aunt and uncle, huge, huge fans of Cobra Kai.

1232
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:23,560
Oh my god.

1233
00:52:23,560 --> 00:52:24,600
Gigantic Cobra Kai fans.

1234
00:52:24,600 --> 00:52:26,760
I didn't even know anybody watched that show, but I think...

1235
00:52:26,760 --> 00:52:27,720
Well, I think they might be...

1236
00:52:27,720 --> 00:52:29,320
That was almost a year ago now.

1237
00:52:29,320 --> 00:52:33,000
If I'm a producer on Nailed It, I'm gonna be grilling the people who are

1238
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:36,040
Cobra Kai specifically. If somebody's like, "Oh, I'm a Riverdale fan," I'll be like, "Yeah,

1239
00:52:36,040 --> 00:52:40,080
I'm sure you are." But if somebody's a Cobra Kai fan, I'm gonna be like, "So what's, uh,

1240
00:52:40,080 --> 00:52:44,400
so like when they built the new Dojo?" Yeah, yeah. You guys should check out Cobra Kai.

1241
00:52:44,400 --> 00:52:47,600
There's some interesting characters. Who do you think is the, who's the best character?

1242
00:52:47,600 --> 00:52:52,840
Hawk. Hawk is awesome. He has a mohawk and he turns evil. But he's a nerd at first, and

1243
00:52:52,840 --> 00:52:58,040
then they teach him karate, and he turns evil and he gets a giant red mohawk. Alright, well

1244
00:52:58,040 --> 00:53:02,320
save some of this for Nailed It, maybe. Yeah. You know, I don't need to know every detail

1245
00:53:02,320 --> 00:53:06,760
of Cobra Kai. Dude, Hawk is a complex character. Oh really? Because he gets bullied

1246
00:53:06,760 --> 00:53:10,680
because he's a nerd. But then once he gets power, he turns into a demon. I did just remember

1247
00:53:10,680 --> 00:53:15,160
something, which is that the last episode of Nailed It I watched was Cobra Kai

1248
00:53:15,160 --> 00:53:21,480
themed, or like they had the cast of Cobra Kai on or something. So that

1249
00:53:21,480 --> 00:53:25,520
would have been a second push. Maybe I didn't get it in. Maybe they canceled it. No, no, because they didn't

1250
00:53:25,520 --> 00:53:30,360
have any fans of Cobra Kai. Oh. Well, this is possible. There was a guy who...

1251
00:53:30,360 --> 00:53:31,280
Maybe I just didn't get it.

1252
00:53:31,280 --> 00:53:32,960
There was a lady who was hosting it,

1253
00:53:32,960 --> 00:53:34,620
and she was one of the people from Cobra Kai,

1254
00:53:34,620 --> 00:53:37,280
and then one of the people competing was from Cobra Kai.

1255
00:53:37,280 --> 00:53:39,320
And almost all they talked about the entire episode

1256
00:53:39,320 --> 00:53:40,160
was Cobra Kai.

1257
00:53:40,160 --> 00:53:41,480
So I'm thinking maybe now I just didn't get it,

1258
00:53:41,480 --> 00:53:42,700
and then that got canceled after.

1259
00:53:42,700 --> 00:53:43,880
When did that come out?

1260
00:53:43,880 --> 00:53:44,720
I probably just didn't get it.

1261
00:53:44,720 --> 00:53:45,540
I have no idea.

1262
00:53:45,540 --> 00:53:47,260
Just search Cobra Kai nailed it,

1263
00:53:47,260 --> 00:53:48,100
and you can see what this--

1264
00:53:48,100 --> 00:53:49,800
Man, I've been going, I mean, even though I know,

1265
00:53:49,800 --> 00:53:51,760
I've always known in my heart that I just didn't get it,

1266
00:53:51,760 --> 00:53:53,400
I have just forever been telling myself

1267
00:53:53,400 --> 00:53:55,800
that it was just 'cause it got canceled.

1268
00:53:55,800 --> 00:53:56,960
Let's see.

1269
00:53:56,960 --> 00:53:57,800
And I'm gonna continue believing that.

1270
00:53:57,800 --> 00:53:59,060
It came out in 2022.

1271
00:53:59,060 --> 00:54:01,360
Oh my god, dude, wait, you got passed up for,

1272
00:54:01,360 --> 00:54:03,140
wait, who's this guy?

1273
00:54:03,140 --> 00:54:06,740
Who's Gianni DiCenzo, that's the dude.

1274
00:54:06,740 --> 00:54:08,200
This is the fucker that, look,

1275
00:54:08,200 --> 00:54:10,500
they picked this guy instead of you.

1276
00:54:10,500 --> 00:54:12,940
Gianni DiCenzo, he was born in Los Angeles

1277
00:54:12,940 --> 00:54:14,700
and resides in the Santa Clarita Valley.

1278
00:54:14,700 --> 00:54:15,540
Wait, wait, wait, but he could also be--

1279
00:54:15,540 --> 00:54:17,060
No, this is the guy from Cobra Kai.

1280
00:54:17,060 --> 00:54:17,900
Yeah, that's what I'm saying.

1281
00:54:17,900 --> 00:54:19,700
He was on the show, he was on Nailed It.

1282
00:54:19,700 --> 00:54:22,100
Okay, and there were no other--

1283
00:54:22,100 --> 00:54:23,100
Wait, there was no other--

1284
00:54:23,100 --> 00:54:24,940
There was no like long-haired, funny guy

1285
00:54:24,940 --> 00:54:25,780
who was on it?

1286
00:54:25,780 --> 00:54:27,100
(laughing)

1287
00:54:27,100 --> 00:54:30,820
himself is on the autism spectrum that makes a lot of sense after watching that

1288
00:54:30,820 --> 00:54:35,860
episode I think that the the they wanted

1289
00:54:35,860 --> 00:54:57,080
make sure you don't mention Godzilla you got passed up for just a an autistic

1290
00:54:57,080 --> 00:55:03,420
guy is closer to the source damn that is so fucked man look at him he's a nerd and

1291
00:55:03,420 --> 00:55:08,660
wait wait make that make that face how you gonna pass up this for this fucking

1292
00:55:08,660 --> 00:55:14,180
guy well he's on the show yeah fuck him that's right he's on the show but then

1293
00:55:14,180 --> 00:55:17,380

00:55:17,380 --> 00:55:21,220
make bake a damn cake to save his I don't think I would have been worse and

1295

I would have been worse and funnier yeah you would have been mm-hmm yeah cuz

1296
00:55:24,540 --> 00:55:25,380
That's the whole point of the show,

1297
00:55:25,380 --> 00:55:26,940
is I'm gonna make the shittiest,

1298
00:55:26,940 --> 00:55:28,020
here's how you win that show,

1299
00:55:28,020 --> 00:55:30,900
every single cake you make like a realistic piece of shit.

1300
00:55:30,900 --> 00:55:31,740
- Yeah. - Right?

1301
00:55:31,740 --> 00:55:32,660
And you're like, oh, I'm sorry,

1302
00:55:32,660 --> 00:55:34,340
I thought I was making a karate fight.

1303
00:55:34,340 --> 00:55:35,180
- Yeah, yeah.

1304
00:55:35,180 --> 00:55:36,540
- But it's a giant lie. - I would have actually cried

1305
00:55:36,540 --> 00:55:37,700
if they let me on that show.

1306
00:55:37,700 --> 00:55:39,540
If the person who reached out to me before

1307
00:55:39,540 --> 00:55:41,700
is still listening, I will cry on command

1308
00:55:41,700 --> 00:55:43,160
for any cooking show you want.

1309
00:55:43,160 --> 00:55:44,000
- All right, let's do a test right now.

1310
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:45,100
- I will make an incredible television--

1311
00:55:45,100 --> 00:55:47,020
- Here's your screen test right now, okay.

1312
00:55:47,020 --> 00:55:49,320
So cut to Cameron, I'll be one of the judges.

1313
00:55:49,320 --> 00:55:50,540
Here, cut to me first.

1314
00:55:50,540 --> 00:55:51,620
Cameron, dun dun.

1315
00:55:53,180 --> 00:55:56,740
After eating your cake and tasting the different flavors

1316
00:55:56,740 --> 00:56:01,200
and eating every single bite of it,

1317
00:56:01,200 --> 00:56:02,160
we have decided

1318
00:56:02,160 --> 00:56:06,060
to let you go.

1319
00:56:06,060 --> 00:56:08,340
Here's a picture of your cake also.

1320
00:56:08,340 --> 00:56:09,900
- This is the cake you made us.

1321
00:56:09,900 --> 00:56:13,140
- We've decided that you have lost the competition

1322
00:56:13,140 --> 00:56:13,980
and have nailed it.

1323
00:56:13,980 --> 00:56:18,200
- At first, I fully believed this was real poop.

1324
00:56:18,200 --> 00:56:22,580
Do we have this for my brother?

1325
00:56:22,580 --> 00:56:23,420
Okay.

1326
00:56:23,420 --> 00:56:25,700
- He's autistic.

1327
00:56:25,700 --> 00:56:27,140
- Oh, I thought you were the autistic one.

1328
00:56:27,140 --> 00:56:27,980
- We both are.

1329
00:56:27,980 --> 00:56:29,040
- Okay, both are.

1330
00:56:29,040 --> 00:56:31,820
- I just thought I was making something good.

1331
00:56:31,820 --> 00:56:33,560
- Okay, so if you thought you were making something good,

1332
00:56:33,560 --> 00:56:37,380
I'm not sure why you made a cat litter, cat shit cake.

1333
00:56:37,380 --> 00:56:38,760
- I like that kind of cake.

1334
00:56:38,760 --> 00:56:39,860
- You like this kind of cake.

1335
00:56:39,860 --> 00:56:41,620
This is the kind of cake that you order

1336
00:56:41,620 --> 00:56:44,260
when you go to Cold Stone Creamery for your birthday.

1337
00:56:44,260 --> 00:56:48,620
- And what kind of parties are you having with this cake?

1338
00:56:48,620 --> 00:56:51,660
- This is a housewarming party cake.

1339
00:56:51,660 --> 00:56:52,660
people walk in.

1340
00:56:52,660 --> 00:56:53,660
I thought it was a post-army party.

1341
00:56:53,660 --> 00:56:54,660
Oh, because you have to move a lot?

1342
00:56:54,660 --> 00:56:55,660
Yeah, because of the smell.

1343
00:56:55,660 --> 00:56:56,660
Because of the smell of the cat-shake cake.

1344
00:56:56,660 --> 00:57:00,660
The smell and your dad is in the army, as we've already discussed.

1345
00:57:00,660 --> 00:57:01,660
Okay.

1346
00:57:01,660 --> 00:57:03,660
And your dad died in the army?

1347
00:57:03,660 --> 00:57:06,660
Well, I'm going to have to kindly ask you to leave the kitchen.

1348
00:57:06,660 --> 00:57:07,660
And scene.

1349
00:57:07,660 --> 00:57:08,660
That's good.

1350
00:57:08,660 --> 00:57:09,660
Wow.

1351
00:57:09,660 --> 00:57:10,660
Can you imagine?

1352
00:57:10,660 --> 00:57:11,660
You have nailed it.

1353
00:57:11,660 --> 00:57:19,160
I would love to be on retainer for some television network to be the person who gets eliminated

1354
00:57:19,160 --> 00:57:21,420
first in every cooking show.

1355
00:57:21,420 --> 00:57:23,020
That would be my dream job.

1356
00:57:23,020 --> 00:57:26,560
Yeah, and then you always should stop touching things.

1357
00:57:26,560 --> 00:57:28,420
I will beat your ass.

1358
00:57:28,420 --> 00:57:30,820
I will beat you down.

1359
00:57:30,820 --> 00:57:33,020
I didn't get to touch it last episode.

1360
00:57:33,020 --> 00:57:33,860
Okay, that's fine.

1361
00:57:33,860 --> 00:57:34,980
That is true.

1362
00:57:34,980 --> 00:57:37,380
Stop, you don't need to touch it anymore though.

1363
00:57:37,380 --> 00:57:41,340
Cameron can touch it.

1364
00:57:41,340 --> 00:57:44,100
Patrick, stop touching it now.

1365
00:57:44,100 --> 00:57:46,900
Oh, Caleb can't stop me from doing this anymore.

1366
00:57:46,900 --> 00:57:47,900
I can stop you.

1367
00:57:47,900 --> 00:57:51,300
I stopped him.

1368
00:57:51,300 --> 00:57:52,140
- It was not me, it was very easy.

1369
00:57:52,140 --> 00:57:56,600
- I think a great, don't push the set, dude, come on.

1370
00:57:56,600 --> 00:57:57,440
Come on.

1371
00:57:57,440 --> 00:57:58,260
(laughing)

1372
00:57:58,260 --> 00:57:59,420
- I didn't think the whole set would--

1373
00:57:59,420 --> 00:58:01,380
- A great thing to do is always to say

1374
00:58:01,380 --> 00:58:03,840
that some family member died when you're getting kicked off.

1375
00:58:03,840 --> 00:58:06,860
You're like, this is a cake, this is a cake I used to make.

1376
00:58:06,860 --> 00:58:08,460
As they're leaving, they're like,

1377
00:58:08,460 --> 00:58:10,180
Derek, you have to leave, and he's like,

1378
00:58:10,180 --> 00:58:15,180
I was actually doing this for my brother who killed himself

1379
00:58:15,180 --> 00:58:17,760
and I'm raising money to stop people

1380
00:58:17,760 --> 00:58:20,300
from killing themselves and--

1381
00:58:20,300 --> 00:58:22,380
I'm raising money to put a net under the--

1382
00:58:22,380 --> 00:58:24,380
But I guess I'll just leave.

1383
00:58:24,380 --> 00:58:27,940
I'm raising money to put a net under the Golden Gate Bridge.

1384
00:58:27,940 --> 00:58:29,700
A big ass net.

1385
00:58:29,700 --> 00:58:31,900
It's so funny that every cooking show

1386
00:58:31,900 --> 00:58:33,940
has evolved into it's sob stories.

1387
00:58:33,940 --> 00:58:37,180
Nobody anymore does, I just wanna make a new restaurant.

1388
00:58:37,180 --> 00:58:38,700
You know what my favorite one that they do

1389
00:58:38,700 --> 00:58:40,340
is when they're like, they've been together,

1390
00:58:40,340 --> 00:58:41,940
this is a four hour shoot.

1391
00:58:41,940 --> 00:58:43,660
They've been together for four hours and they're like,

1392
00:58:43,660 --> 00:58:47,740
I'm just gonna miss all my friends that I made here.

1393
00:58:47,740 --> 00:58:49,740
And it's like, there's two other people here,

1394
00:58:49,740 --> 00:58:51,560
You all live in Los Angeles.

1395
00:58:51,560 --> 00:58:53,360
You can keep hanging out with these people.

1396
00:58:53,360 --> 00:58:54,960
It's really not a big deal.

1397
00:58:54,960 --> 00:58:55,800
- Yeah.

1398
00:58:55,800 --> 00:58:59,180
- I wonder if they ever have like a friend meet up

1399
00:58:59,180 --> 00:59:00,620
at a bar after the show.

1400
00:59:00,620 --> 00:59:01,680
- You think they go to a bar?

1401
00:59:01,680 --> 00:59:02,620
- No, definitely not.

1402
00:59:02,620 --> 00:59:03,460
They hate each other.

1403
00:59:03,460 --> 00:59:04,660
- Maybe the alligator lounge.

1404
00:59:04,660 --> 00:59:05,720
- They should make one.

1405
00:59:05,720 --> 00:59:06,600
I don't know what that is.

1406
00:59:06,600 --> 00:59:09,640
They should make one where they do--

1407
00:59:09,640 --> 00:59:10,640
- Oh, we got a message.

1408
00:59:10,640 --> 00:59:12,000
(laughing)

1409
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:13,280
- Wait, they hit us back?

1410
00:59:13,280 --> 00:59:15,240
- Yeah, $1.5.

1411
00:59:15,240 --> 00:59:16,520
- Whoa! - Whoa!

1412
00:59:16,520 --> 00:59:17,680
- Okay, yeah, yeah.

1413
00:59:17,680 --> 00:59:19,400
Say reply, say deal.

1414
00:59:19,400 --> 00:59:20,400
Say deal.

1415
00:59:20,400 --> 00:59:22,260
We have to. Deal.

1416
00:59:22,260 --> 00:59:24,260
Say yes. Say deal right now.

1417
00:59:24,260 --> 00:59:26,060
Hurry. Deal right now.

1418
00:59:26,060 --> 00:59:28,880
One point five dollars.

1419
00:59:28,880 --> 00:59:30,380
One point five dollars. A great deal.

1420
00:59:30,380 --> 00:59:31,380
That's good.

1421
00:59:31,380 --> 00:59:34,620
For a freak pervert T-shirt.

1422
00:59:34,620 --> 00:59:35,760
Wow.

1423
00:59:35,760 --> 00:59:38,440
What was I talking about?

1424
00:59:38,440 --> 00:59:40,360
Oh yeah. The contestant thing.

1425
00:59:40,360 --> 00:59:42,680
Yeah. I think you have to say somebody

1426
00:59:42,680 --> 00:59:43,960
has cancer. Somebody died.

1427
00:59:43,960 --> 00:59:45,460
And then you win no matter what.

1428
00:59:45,460 --> 00:59:47,520
Yeah. Somebody is going to die

1429
00:59:47,520 --> 00:59:48,720
when I go home.

1430
00:59:48,720 --> 00:59:50,460
(laughing)

1431
00:59:50,460 --> 00:59:51,300
- That's just so sad because--

1432
00:59:51,300 --> 00:59:53,720
- After this, it's just so sad that both of my kids

1433
00:59:53,720 --> 00:59:57,120
and my wife have to die because I couldn't win.

1434
00:59:57,120 --> 00:59:59,200
- Wait, wait, wait, are you saying that they died

1435
00:59:59,200 --> 01:00:00,160
and that's why you're here?

1436
01:00:00,160 --> 01:00:01,840
- No. - They're going to die.

1437
01:00:01,840 --> 01:00:04,040
- I'm going and you know what?

1438
01:00:04,040 --> 01:00:07,900
I've never ever tried to kill someone with a car before.

1439
01:00:07,900 --> 01:00:09,960
So I guess I'm gonna have to try that out

1440
01:00:09,960 --> 01:00:12,040
when I go home on my wife and two kids.

1441
01:00:12,040 --> 01:00:13,320
- Okay, I think you're getting confused.

1442
01:00:13,320 --> 01:00:15,880
I think what you're saying is that your family has died

1443
01:00:15,880 --> 01:00:18,320
and you're doing it for them in support of them

1444
01:00:18,320 --> 01:00:21,160
to maybe raise money for their funerals or caskets.

1445
01:00:21,160 --> 01:00:23,180
- Hey, we're gonna have to raise a lot of money

1446
01:00:23,180 --> 01:00:25,340
after they die because there's gonna be

1447
01:00:25,340 --> 01:00:27,260
a lot of destruction of property.

1448
01:00:27,260 --> 01:00:28,100
- Yeah. - Is what I'm saying.

1449
01:00:28,100 --> 01:00:29,840
- And then they finally usher you off the set

1450
01:00:29,840 --> 01:00:32,040
and then the next person gets kicked off

1451
01:00:32,040 --> 01:00:34,040
and is like, it's just really sad

1452
01:00:34,040 --> 01:00:36,120
that that guy's family has to die

1453
01:00:36,120 --> 01:00:37,920
now that I'm getting kicked off the show.

1454
01:00:37,920 --> 01:00:39,780
(laughing)

1455
01:00:39,780 --> 01:00:42,640
You may have locked him up, but his family's still not safe.

1456
01:00:42,640 --> 01:00:43,800
(laughing)

1457
01:00:43,800 --> 01:00:44,720
I'm roaming free. - It's just really,

1458
01:00:44,720 --> 01:00:47,360
really sad, just loading bullets in a revolver right now.

1459
01:00:47,360 --> 01:00:48,720
It's just so sad.

1460
01:00:48,720 --> 01:00:52,000
It's so sad that I get to shoot the car that they're going to be in.

1461
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:53,000
It's so sad.

1462
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:55,240
I'm going to have to shoot it in the gas tank so it blows up.

1463
01:00:55,240 --> 01:00:56,240
I have a Tommy gun.

1464
01:00:56,240 --> 01:00:58,400
I have a Tommy gun like a gangster.

1465
01:00:58,400 --> 01:01:03,340
It's just so sad that they didn't run a background check on me at Walmart.

1466
01:01:03,340 --> 01:01:05,560
It's honestly just a real big tragedy.

1467
01:01:05,560 --> 01:01:06,560
I can't believe it.

1468
01:01:06,560 --> 01:01:08,240
I bought a Tommy gun at Walmart.

1469
01:01:08,240 --> 01:01:11,240
It just sucks that you guys gave me all these chef's tools.

1470
01:01:11,240 --> 01:01:15,400
All these giant fillet knives.

1471
01:01:15,400 --> 01:01:19,400
It's so, so, so sad that you can buy that much gunpowder on Amazon.

1472
01:01:19,400 --> 01:01:22,720
Just walking out, that would do this thing where they shoot you walking down the hallway

1473
01:01:22,720 --> 01:01:23,720
out of the thing.

1474
01:01:23,720 --> 01:01:29,000
You're like, "It's so sad," and you're just holding the blast freezer as you walk out.

1475
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:31,440
It's so sad that this thing could fit a human head in it.

1476
01:01:31,440 --> 01:01:34,360
It's so sad that you can fit an entire human head in here.

1477
01:01:34,360 --> 01:01:36,960
And then it turns on with the door open.

1478
01:01:36,960 --> 01:01:37,960
It's so, so sad.

1479
01:01:37,960 --> 01:01:43,800
What an awful, awful world.

1480
01:01:43,800 --> 01:01:47,120
It's so sad that this is the last episode of this show ever because the hosts are both

1481
01:01:47,120 --> 01:01:49,320
going to die.

1482
01:01:49,320 --> 01:01:54,360
It's so sad that I studied what the hosts' cars look like and I'm going to follow them

1483
01:01:54,360 --> 01:01:55,360
around.

1484
01:01:55,360 --> 01:01:56,720
It's so sad that I have your license plates memorized.

1485
01:01:56,720 --> 01:01:58,520
I know exactly where you live.

1486
01:01:58,520 --> 01:02:02,240
It's so sad that every address has to be public.

1487
01:02:02,240 --> 01:02:03,680
It's just sad.

1488
01:02:03,680 --> 01:02:06,000
It's so sad that guns.com exists.

1489
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:07,000
Do you guys just look at it?

1490
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:08,000
Is that how much it costs?

1491
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:12,060
And then this is, and then the guy who wins, they're like, what are you going to do now

1492
01:02:12,060 --> 01:02:14,060
that you win and he kills himself on TV.

1493
01:02:14,060 --> 01:02:14,900
- Oh yeah, yeah.

1494
01:02:14,900 --> 01:02:15,740
- And you just wanted the attention.

1495
01:02:15,740 --> 01:02:16,560
- Yeah.

1496
01:02:16,560 --> 01:02:17,400
- Yippee!

1497
01:02:17,400 --> 01:02:18,240
- Most of these people, that's the thing.

1498
01:02:18,240 --> 01:02:19,740
- They have a tight shot on his face.

1499
01:02:19,740 --> 01:02:20,580
- In his mouth.

1500
01:02:20,580 --> 01:02:21,400
(laughing)

1501
01:02:21,400 --> 01:02:22,580
- A lot of the people who try to become actors,

1502
01:02:22,580 --> 01:02:23,780
they just want attention, right?

1503
01:02:23,780 --> 01:02:24,620
- Yeah.

1504
01:02:24,620 --> 01:02:25,440
- That's pretty well established.

1505
01:02:25,440 --> 01:02:26,820
- The best way to get attention is to hurt yourself.

1506
01:02:26,820 --> 01:02:27,660
- Yeah.

1507
01:02:27,660 --> 01:02:28,480
(laughing)

1508
01:02:28,480 --> 01:02:29,620
- The best way to get attention?

1509
01:02:29,620 --> 01:02:30,620
Holding your breath.

1510
01:02:30,620 --> 01:02:32,220
- If you hold your breath, if you scream,

1511
01:02:32,220 --> 01:02:33,940
if you scratch your eyes out and stuff.

1512
01:02:33,940 --> 01:02:35,260
People are gonna be like, whoa!

1513
01:02:35,260 --> 01:02:36,860
- Especially from your family.

1514
01:02:36,860 --> 01:02:39,100
- Yeah, so instead of trying to become an actor,

1515
01:02:39,100 --> 01:02:42,400
wasting all your family's money and resources, just walk up to them and start just like scratch

1516
01:02:42,400 --> 01:02:44,700
yourself, cut yourself, and like pull your hair out.

1517
01:02:44,700 --> 01:02:45,700
Yeah, it's yell.

1518
01:02:45,700 --> 01:02:46,700
Yeah.

1519
01:02:46,700 --> 01:02:47,700
Say there's a demon in here.

1520
01:02:47,700 --> 01:02:49,260
Make your hair look like Angelica's doll.

1521
01:02:49,260 --> 01:02:51,660
Maybe give yourself poison that gives you a new disease.

1522
01:02:51,660 --> 01:02:53,300
Yeah, stuff like that is a probably good idea.

1523
01:02:53,300 --> 01:02:54,420
Stuff like that's always a safe bet.

1524
01:02:54,420 --> 01:02:57,420
You could order one of those, you know, you can buy a piece of, I think you can buy a

1525
01:02:57,420 --> 01:02:58,900
piece of uranium on Amazon.

1526
01:02:58,900 --> 01:02:59,900
Really?

1527
01:02:59,900 --> 01:03:00,900
Yeah.

1528
01:03:00,900 --> 01:03:04,820
You know what else you can buy is a Home Depot 2x4.

1529
01:03:04,820 --> 01:03:08,060
Is that what Angelica's doll looked like on...

1530
01:03:08,060 --> 01:03:14,500
days maybe. Yeah. Alright. Regrets? You know what I'd regret having that fucking kid Chuckie

1531
01:03:14,500 --> 01:03:21,500
Finster. He's a sissy. He is a total sissy. Chuckie Finster's dad, Bernie Mac. He's a sissy!

1532
01:03:21,500 --> 01:03:30,820
I, hey guys, I have never seen, I've never seen the Rugrats. I've never watched the TV

1533
01:03:30,820 --> 01:03:35,140
show the Rugrats. You think that's a good idea? No, just because I'm wearing this shirt

1534
01:03:35,140 --> 01:03:37,140
I can't say that I will watch that show.

1535
01:03:37,140 --> 01:03:39,140
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

1536

Alright.
