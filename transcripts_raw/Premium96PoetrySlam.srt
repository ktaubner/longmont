[explosion]

6
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:14,760
Doth the beauty...

7
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:16,760
Oh, we need to write a poem.

8
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:18,760
Doth the beautiful beauty...

9
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:20,760
Doth the beer tea...

10
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:22,760
Doth the beer tea hath drinking of...

11
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:24,760
Homer...

12
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:26,760
Of lovely yellow Homer,

13
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:28,760
and sweet thy...

14
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:33,440
thy son Bart be him ever so mischievous.

15
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:46,280
And behested upon Marge is a gargantuan blue head of hair and

16
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:49,280
there was a child named Maggie.

17
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:52,600
Ah, the saxophone.

18
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:55,480
Avast ye, ye Homer.

19
00:00:55,480 --> 00:01:00,480
The saxophone of Lisa doth play all night and all day.

20
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:03,680
Then sweet tunes echo through the halls of Moe's Tavern.

21
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:04,880
An ode to Homer.

22
00:01:04,880 --> 00:01:10,080
Oh Homer, betwixt thy two hairs upon thine head, thy yellow

23
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:13,580
head sits on thy shoulders.

24
00:01:13,580 --> 00:01:14,380
Yes.

25
00:01:14,380 --> 00:01:17,180
Thy big fat stupid shoulders.

26
00:01:17,180 --> 00:01:18,480
Oh Homer.

27
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:23,180
Thine, thine, thine duff doth flow.

28
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:27,440
- Let the duff flow and the--

29
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:28,980
- Donuts grow.

30
00:01:28,980 --> 00:01:33,980
- Comic book guy is oh so fat.

31
00:01:33,980 --> 00:01:40,280
And Linney, oh Linney the dark friend.

32
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:48,920
- Professor Frank, always he think.

33
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:51,720
- Yes, yes.

34
00:01:51,720 --> 00:02:04,920
Dr. Nick doth scam the town's only man, Homer. Homer, you yellow bastard.

35
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:13,480
You yellow-bellied and rest of your body bastard. You have drank your

36
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:20,400
last duff. Oh, how... And now you will be... Now your life is enough.

37
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:32,240
And as the sun sets on the lovely land of Springfield, the Simpsons clan retreats to their couch.

38
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:34,400
That was beautiful.

39
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:40,720
We've all been standing like it was the Pledge of Allegiance for this whole thing.

40
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:44,400
We have a conga drum in the corner of the room, but we haven't been playing it.

41
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:47,600
That's what people do at Poetry Slams. They snap after poems.

42
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:48,080
I don't know.

43
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:48,880
I don't know how you do it.

44
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:49,840
You snap it back.

45
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:54,960
Don't don't snap like that. Why? I think you go like this. You snap like in someone's face.

46
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:59,600
You can't shake. No, you're doing a face with it too. I think a lot of people...

47
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:03,000
What's wrong with that? A lot of people after they hear a poem too will like

48
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,840
snap in the other person's face and go, "Excuse me!" Really? Yeah, that's kind of a

49
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:10,240
thing people do at Poetry Slams too. We should go to a Poetry Slam tonight and be the best, do the best etiquette of all time.

50
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:13,480
Well, we don't have to go to a Poetry Slam tonight because we got one right here right now.

51
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:17,080
Yeah, that's a really good point. Yeah. I feel like we need like a... we do... we should have

52
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:22,360
brought a fucking just like a snare drum. That's what I was saying, we have a conga drum in

53
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:26,760
the corner but it's broken. It's broken because we were playing with the butterfly knife over

54
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:33,200
the conga drum. It happens. And both times we hit both drums. Yeah and it popped my ear

55
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:38,360
drums out. Yeah. I can't hear much. Thine ear drums. Thine ear drums shall be popped.

56
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:42,800
Oh poetry I love it so. Poetry is kind of like my one true love in this world. I'm basically

57
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:49,000
poetry all the time even when I'm at the deli and I'll say cigarettes I can have

58
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:54,320
like yoga I might it's kind of like talking I'm gonna have an early night

59
00:03:54,320 --> 00:04:07,480
yeah I did on my first chopped cheese today

60
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:15,880
liked it. How was that chopped cheese? It sparkled for my stomach like a star

61
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:18,080
possessed. Ahoy matey!

62
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:28,380
God, I love poetry. There once was a chopped cheese from Bodega and it was

63
00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:29,280
delicious.

64
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:35,580
I say yeah. Damn, I'm gonna call you. I'm gonna call you William Steaksbeard.

65
00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:39,580
had inside it had cheese and ingredients please.

66
00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:44,740
Hey, Ock, let me get a chopped cheese with the ingredients on it.

67
00:04:44,740 --> 00:04:47,580
And that was the chopped cheese Ock made, yeah.

68
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:50,460
Wow, you're a veritable Shel Silverstein.

69
00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:54,340
Yeah, my specialization in poetry is mostly limericks.

70
00:04:54,340 --> 00:04:57,580
You know how like in like Hogwarts you can do all the different types?

71
00:04:57,580 --> 00:05:02,900
I went to poetry school and I chose limericks.

72
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:03,900
You're a dimwit.

73
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:04,900
No.

74
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:05,900
I wouldn't say that.

75
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:06,900
Okay, never mind.

76
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:07,900
Sorry, I don't have a specialization.

77
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:18,360
Thy insults fail thee, my dim-witted friend, with his head so shiny and his brain so small

78
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:21,900
and a smelly hiney and tiny balls.

79
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:25,900
See, you and smelly balls.

80
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:26,900
I don't have tiny balls.

81
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:27,900
They're humongous.

82
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:29,580
I don't know about that.

83
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:31,660
It's like a walnut in the shell.

84
00:05:31,660 --> 00:05:32,660
All right.

85
00:05:32,660 --> 00:05:33,660
Well, let's get in.

86
00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:40,660
Speaking of balls and such, I'll kick off our poetry slam here.

87
00:05:40,660 --> 00:05:41,660
Oh yeah.

88
00:05:41,660 --> 00:05:42,660
This is a very special...

89
00:05:42,660 --> 00:05:46,660
Oh, I shared mine with you because there's some photos that I think you need to see.

90
00:05:46,660 --> 00:05:47,660
You can...

91
00:05:47,660 --> 00:05:50,660
Here, it'll be easier if you do it from your phone, if that's okay, I think.

92
00:05:50,660 --> 00:05:52,660
Yeah, I'll just show the...

93
00:05:52,660 --> 00:05:53,660
Yeah.

94
00:05:53,660 --> 00:05:59,500
Okay, so this is a website called allpoetry.com and these are some just brilliant poems that

95
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:03,500
people have written that we wanted to share with you guys today on our very special premium

96
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:11,220
episode. This is a poem by Magic Light named "A Wiener in Winter" and this is, I

97
00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:14,660
mean, this is simply enchanting. I'm trying to think of where this could go.

98
00:06:14,660 --> 00:06:20,800
Let me, let me, let me read this to you guys. I see so many welders, they're busy

99
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:25,700
as can be, helping the brass monkeys. It's as cold as it can be. With record snows

100
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:29,840
and chilling winds blowing from the east. It's coming from Siberia, they're calling

101
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:34,640
it the beast. Wieners just don't like it, as every man will tell, for they retract and

102
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:39,280
disappear like a snail into its shell. All shriveled up, it hides away, won't raise its

103
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:44,560
ugly head. The cowardly little worm-like thing looks like he's fucking dead. He's not so brave

104
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:48,720
and hard now, 'cause the weather's really cold. Won't stand up to attention, even when

105
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:53,600
he's fucking told. He's curled up in my Calvin Klein's, he's really lacking guts. Just like

106
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:58,000
a squirrel, he hibernates and clinging to my nuts. I've even tried to coax him out with

107
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,440
of Pornhub we would view.

108
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:01,120
He keeps his one eye firmly closed.

109
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:02,680
Now that is something new.

110
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:05,360
I'll check the weather forecast to see how long this lasts

111
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:08,520
'cause I can't have a wiener that's afraid of chilly blasts.

112
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:11,360
I pray that soon a thaw will come and melt away the snow

113
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:13,000
with a sigh of great relief.

114
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:17,000
They don't want us to read this.

115
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,400
- They're trying to shut it down already

116
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:20,480
'cause the poetry could change the world and they know it.

117
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:21,320
- True.

118
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:23,680
I pray that soon a thaw will come and melt away the snow

119
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:24,960
with a sigh of great relief.

120
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:26,520
I'll watch my wiener grow.

121
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:29,140
No longer I'm embarrassed as he often looked deceased.

122
00:07:29,140 --> 00:07:30,820
I've now nicknamed him Lazarus.

123
00:07:30,820 --> 00:07:31,660
He has risen.

124
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:33,460
He's the beast.

125
00:07:33,460 --> 00:07:34,300
- Whoa. - Damn.

126
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:37,700
- Mm-hmm. - Stop.

127
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:38,740
- What? - Stop doing that.

128
00:07:38,740 --> 00:07:41,260
- No, it's disrespectful to say mm-hmm after a poem.

129
00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:42,180
You just snap. - Why?

130
00:07:42,180 --> 00:07:43,020
- You just don't. - It's just the etiquette.

131
00:07:43,020 --> 00:07:44,660
- Have you been to a poetry slam?

132
00:07:44,660 --> 00:07:45,940
- No. - What?

133
00:07:45,940 --> 00:07:47,780
- God damn it, you just don't know etiquette, I guess.

134
00:07:47,780 --> 00:07:51,140
- That's what I do after I eat something good, too.

135
00:07:51,140 --> 00:07:51,980
- Really? - Yeah, I go to Allgarden.

136
00:07:51,980 --> 00:07:53,400
- I've never seen you do that.

137
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:54,740
- I get a pasta fagioli.

138
00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:57,020
I haven't seen you do that either.

139
00:07:57,020 --> 00:07:58,020
You haven't seen me do that?

140
00:07:58,020 --> 00:07:59,020
No.

141
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:00,260
Well, it's good I never swallow when I'm around you guys.

142
00:08:00,260 --> 00:08:01,260
Sure, yeah.

143
00:08:01,260 --> 00:08:02,260
Yeah, you spit into a napkin.

144
00:08:02,260 --> 00:08:06,020
Well, I just like, yeah, I just like chew with my mouth open and let it all kind of

145
00:08:06,020 --> 00:08:07,020
fall out.

146
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:08,020
That is true.

147
00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:11,060
Whenever we eat at a restaurant also, you do also ask us to go to the bathroom after

148
00:08:11,060 --> 00:08:12,060
we're finished eating.

149
00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:13,060
Yeah, not me go to the bathroom.

150
00:08:13,060 --> 00:08:14,060
I ask you guys to go to the bathroom.

151
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:15,060
Yeah, exactly.

152
00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:17,060
I mean, I like doing stuff for my friends, so I always do it.

153
00:08:17,060 --> 00:08:20,860
And then I kind of spit my food out and put it in different places and like kind of curl

154
00:08:20,860 --> 00:08:23,540
napkins up to make it look like I ate all of it.

155
00:08:23,540 --> 00:08:24,540
Yeah.

156
00:08:24,540 --> 00:08:27,260
I push my belly out like I'm pretending to be pregnant.

157
00:08:27,260 --> 00:08:29,020
I actually, I usually bring a pillow with me.

158
00:08:29,020 --> 00:08:31,680
I put the pillow under my shirt and I say,

159
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:34,740
oh, mm-hmm, I'm so full.

160
00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:38,060
- All right, who's reading the next poem here?

161
00:08:38,060 --> 00:08:39,320
- I have a poem here.

162
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:43,300
This is a poem by Shannon Norman.

163
00:08:43,300 --> 00:08:47,980
And Shannon Norman has a very specific style of poetry

164
00:08:47,980 --> 00:08:54,100
where she finds Halloween costumes on Google Images.

165
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:59,660
Okay. And writes poems about Halloween costumes. I mean, inspiration can come from

166
00:08:59,660 --> 00:09:03,620
anywhere. That's the beautiful thing about poetry. So this poem by Shannon is called

167
00:09:03,620 --> 00:09:10,260
Popeye's Sexy Sister. All right. She's a sailor, sexy smart with a mouth that'll

168
00:09:10,260 --> 00:09:14,700
make you blush. Wearing those tight shorts with stilettos, not an ordinary

169
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:20,580
lush. That sailor hat is just too cute. Worn with a nice striped blouse, you won't

170
00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:26,820

171
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:32,300

174
00:09:41,140 --> 00:09:47,700
another poem here it's okay the same vein yeah this one is sexy pirate gal I love

175
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:50,860
I love the titles, they're so evocative.

176
00:09:50,860 --> 00:09:56,020
"Careful where you aim that pistol, sexy pirate gal.

177
00:09:56,020 --> 00:09:59,820
Some will like your badass look and call you a great pal.

178
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:03,420
I think your boots are thick and slick and I dig your hat.

179
00:10:03,420 --> 00:10:07,020
That pirate garb has sex appeal, but everyone knows that."

180
00:10:07,020 --> 00:10:08,020
True.

181
00:10:08,020 --> 00:10:09,020
Wow.

182
00:10:09,020 --> 00:10:10,500
Well, that one hit me.

183
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:12,180
Yeah, that one hit me right in my soul.

184
00:10:12,180 --> 00:10:13,220
I'm crying a little bit.

185
00:10:13,220 --> 00:10:14,220
I'm drooling.

186
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:18,620
I'm crying because I don't know what is happening to me.

187
00:10:18,620 --> 00:10:19,620
Yeah.

188
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:20,620
Yeah.

189
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:21,620
My body.

190
00:10:21,620 --> 00:10:24,220
It's like, I mean.

191
00:10:24,220 --> 00:10:25,220
Sweating a lot too.

192
00:10:25,220 --> 00:10:28,740
I mean, you weren't sweaty at all when you walked in, but you're soaked.

193
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:31,140
I'm crying from my body.

194
00:10:31,140 --> 00:10:33,020
One of your arms is really red.

195
00:10:33,020 --> 00:10:34,020
Yeah.

196
00:10:34,020 --> 00:10:35,020
Yeah.

197
00:10:35,020 --> 00:10:36,020
That's a reaction.

198
00:10:36,020 --> 00:10:37,020
Which one?

199
00:10:37,020 --> 00:10:38,020
I see like a Hulk vein popping out on your arm too.

200
00:10:38,020 --> 00:10:39,500
Yeah, the other one was green.

201
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:41,340
Now I see it.

202
00:10:41,340 --> 00:10:44,740
So I found this guy, I'm gonna read a few of this dude.

203
00:10:44,740 --> 00:10:45,740
Yeah, of course.

204
00:10:45,740 --> 00:10:49,140
Because this is kind of telling this whole story I would say.

205
00:10:49,140 --> 00:10:53,660
So I was looking for weed palms and this guy has a, his name is Joe Fetick.

206
00:10:53,660 --> 00:10:55,980
What are you honking at?

207
00:10:55,980 --> 00:10:56,980
I'm in here.

208
00:10:56,980 --> 00:10:57,980
You know where I am.

209
00:10:57,980 --> 00:10:58,980
Fuck dude, stop.

210
00:10:58,980 --> 00:10:59,980
I'm trying to read.

211
00:10:59,980 --> 00:11:08,780
Alright, I'm just gonna, we're gonna pretend that's a nice drum line in the back.

212
00:11:08,780 --> 00:11:09,780
It's just, you know.

213
00:11:09,780 --> 00:11:10,780
It's atmosphere.

214
00:11:10,780 --> 00:11:17,020
the tone. This is Joe Fettig and his, let me see if I can read his bio for you guys real

215
00:11:17,020 --> 00:11:23,520
quick. He's kind of the man I was looking, oh yeah, okay. I'm a self-published writer

216
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:27,800
from Redmond, Oregon. I've self-published six books so far. If you enjoy reading my poems,

00:11:32,580 --> 00:11:37,440
various mini-subjects. If you find my poetry interesting, you can buy the books on Amazon.

219
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:39,200
So here's the books that he has listed.

220
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:44,520
The Red Pill eBook, True Patriot eBook, True Patriot Paperback, Ghostwriter Self Publish

221
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:50,460
eBook and Paperback in Large Print, Dark Ages Self Publish eBook, Dark Soul Poetry.

222
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:52,120
So I found his poem about weed.

223
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:53,120
Here it is.

224
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:54,120
It's called Old School Stoner.

225
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:55,120
Okay.

226
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:57,100
I'm an old school stoner.

227
00:11:57,100 --> 00:12:00,040
I remember wearing tie-dye shirts back in the day.

228
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:05,240
Smoking out of a metal pipe then, I would listen to some reggae.

229
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:07,720
Those were the days I would only buy an eighth of weed.

230
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:10,040
Smoke it up that night, that was all I need.

231
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:11,040
Things have changed now.

232
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:13,540
I can go to the dispensary and buy one ounce.

233
00:12:13,540 --> 00:12:16,540
Buy the top shelf quality weed, then bounce.

234
00:12:16,540 --> 00:12:17,540
Everything is legal now.

235
00:12:17,540 --> 00:12:19,240
Oregon is a green state.

236
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:20,700
Let's go smoke a bowl now.

237
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:21,700
Time to medicate.

238
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:24,160
So that was the first thing I found.

239
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:25,160
That's really beautiful.

240
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:30,500
And I found another just beautiful poem from him.

241
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:33,760
This is called Asian Beauty.

242
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:36,020
(laughing)

243
00:12:36,020 --> 00:12:39,160
- Wait, did I show you guys a picture of this guy?

244
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:40,000
- Yeah, let's see here.

245
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:40,840
- All right, he's there.

246
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:41,680
- Oh yeah, that's what I'm talking about.

247
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:43,560
- He's wearing a thin blue line shirt

248
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:46,240
that says, "Men going their own way."

249
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:47,920
- Oh, wow.

250
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:48,960
That's awesome. - Yeah, he's awesome.

251
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:49,800
- It's one of the coolest--

252
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:51,400
- Hold on, can you find that shirt for me?

253
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:52,240
- I might try.

254
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:54,520
This is Asian Beauty, five months ago.

255
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:56,040
"She was an Asian beauty.

256
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:58,020
"I couldn't help it, I just fell in love.

257
00:12:58,020 --> 00:13:00,040
"Tired of going my own way sometimes.

258
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:02,820
"Deep inside my heart, I wanna find true love.

259
00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:06,020
She is so soft-spoken, elegant and sweet.

260
00:13:06,020 --> 00:13:08,020
She's girlfriend material.

261
00:13:08,020 --> 00:13:09,620
It's time I turn up the heat.

262
00:13:09,620 --> 00:13:13,320
Romance is in the air as the sushi flies off the plate.

263
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:15,320
[Laughter]

264
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:16,820
I just wanna be with you.

265
00:13:16,820 --> 00:13:18,520
Let me take you on a date.

266
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:20,220
I can teach you the way of love.

267
00:13:20,220 --> 00:13:22,020
All you have to do is open your heart.

268
00:13:22,020 --> 00:13:23,720
You're the woman I need in my life.

269
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:25,520
You're my sweetheart.

270
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:26,820
I see you looking at me.

271
00:13:26,820 --> 00:13:29,220
Come closer to me when you look into my eyes.

272
00:13:29,220 --> 00:13:30,620
Let me kiss you out of the blue.

273
00:13:30,620 --> 00:13:32,420
Give you a sweet surprise.

274
00:13:32,420 --> 00:13:37,660
I want to get you to know you more. One day you could be my wife. The power of love, the

275
00:13:37,660 --> 00:13:44,020
lessons we learn in life." Okay, so then this is where it takes, unfortunately...

276
00:13:44,020 --> 00:13:45,020
Everyone can relate to that.

277
00:13:45,020 --> 00:13:47,780
Yeah, I mean everyone's been there. So tell me if you can relate to this one. This one's

278
00:13:47,780 --> 00:13:56,220
called "I also am one blowjob away." This seems a little more aggressive, so I'm going

279
00:13:56,220 --> 00:13:57,220
to give it something here.

280
00:13:57,220 --> 00:13:58,220
Okay.

281
00:13:58,220 --> 00:14:02,380
"I am one blowjob away from leaving the plantation. Men go in their own ways, growing across the

282
00:14:02,380 --> 00:14:07,900
the nation. Feminism has destroyed relationships. How the fuck am I going to date? You have become

283
00:14:07,900 --> 00:14:13,340
so toxic and masculine I can't even call you my soulmate. You can't even give me a blow job. You're

284
00:14:13,340 --> 00:14:20,060
supposed to do it every day. That's why you can't keep a man. I'm gonna leave you. I'm not gonna

285
00:14:20,060 --> 00:14:25,020
stay. You're so focused on your money and your career. I don't care about your success. You just

286
00:14:25,020 --> 00:14:29,820
want to ride the cock carousel until you're 40 then expect someone to save your mess. I'm not

287
00:14:29,820 --> 00:14:32,540
I'm not going to marry you and risk to lose half my shit.

288
00:14:32,540 --> 00:14:34,180
I'm just going to end our relationship,

289
00:14:34,180 --> 00:14:35,780
then call me a hypocrite.

290
00:14:35,780 --> 00:14:37,620
You want me to make all the sacrifices

291
00:14:37,620 --> 00:14:39,620
while you haven't changed, you have made none.

292
00:14:39,620 --> 00:14:42,060
You're too busy playing with your phone on social media,

293
00:14:42,060 --> 00:14:44,060
talking to other guys while I'm done.

294
00:14:44,060 --> 00:14:47,740
I'm just one blow job away from leaving the dating scene.

295
00:14:47,740 --> 00:14:49,300
I need to focus on myself more,

296
00:14:49,300 --> 00:14:51,340
become a money making machine.

297
00:14:51,340 --> 00:14:53,460
If she is not giving you a blow job,

298
00:14:53,460 --> 00:14:56,100
tell her it's required on the first date.

299
00:14:56,100 --> 00:14:59,100
If she refuses and doesn't submit to you,

300
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:02,020
break up with her and set her straight.

301
00:15:02,020 --> 00:15:03,700
- By Joe Fatigue.

302
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:05,140
- God damn, Joe.

303
00:15:05,140 --> 00:15:06,140
- Ooh, Joe.

304
00:15:06,140 --> 00:15:08,780
- I mean, there is, there is,

305
00:15:08,780 --> 00:15:11,100
I'll read this one later.

306
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:11,940
- Okay.

307
00:15:11,940 --> 00:15:12,760
- I'll read, all right, yeah,

308
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:14,900
we'll go around once and then I'll read another one.

309
00:15:14,900 --> 00:15:16,400
- I'm gonna, I have some collections

310
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:18,180
of some really talented poet.

311
00:15:18,180 --> 00:15:20,940
Oh, this mic just stopped working for a second.

312
00:15:20,940 --> 00:15:23,020
I have some collections of some really talented poets

313
00:15:23,020 --> 00:15:26,220
that I also found, but I'm gonna read just a one-off here.

314
00:15:26,220 --> 00:15:27,860
This one, I think, is, this is another thing

315
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:31,180
It's an issue I think a lot of people have dealt with in their life.

316
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:37,660
So I was wanting to help Trinity0513 speak some truth to power here.

317
00:15:37,660 --> 00:15:44,700
So this is a poem entitled Spanish Teacher.

318
00:15:44,700 --> 00:15:49,580
I absolutely hate my Spanish class, the reason why I'm about to amass.

319
00:15:49,580 --> 00:15:53,940
At first I enjoyed it, there was nothing wrong, until a new teacher came along, one by the

320
00:15:53,940 --> 00:15:55,780
name of Vivian Docobo.

321
00:15:55,780 --> 00:15:59,880
I'm convinced she's actually loco assigning us work. I'll do in an hour.

322
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:03,780
Her expression is always dour only giving certain kids extra credit

323
00:16:03,780 --> 00:16:07,080
something good. She will never say it. She says she treats everyone the

324
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:10,580
same. Honestly, she brings this whole school to shame project to sign

325
00:16:10,580 --> 00:16:14,280
day after day and active caring. She will never display. She's white

326
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:18,380
not even Hispanic and frankly, she's rather satanic doesn't even

327
00:16:18,380 --> 00:16:21,580
have an accent. It always says y'all just being in her class makes

328
00:16:21,580 --> 00:16:24,880
me ball. I'm going to stop now before I say too much. If you want

329
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:28,400
want to keep listening to me rant, I'll be sure to keep in touch. All I have to say

330
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:31,960
is don't take my words for granted. Hopefully, your knowledge has expanded.

331
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:35,960
Learning about my bad Spanish teacher, I bet now you don't like her either. I

332
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:41,980
don't like Mrs. Dokebo. Mrs. Dookiebo? Oh, Mrs. Dookiebo. I do actually. I forgot.

333
00:16:41,980 --> 00:16:45,880
This person does this. I'm, you know, I'm, I'll just read one more by this

334
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:50,480
person. Oh, yeah. 'Cause this is a similar topic here. Pate math teacher. I thought

335
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:53,920
my teacher would be great, but instead, it was Pate. This woman fills me with

336
00:16:53,940 --> 00:16:56,500
Her breast smells horrible and this woman should obliterate.

337
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:58,260
I'm shocked she isn't overweight.

338
00:16:58,260 --> 00:16:59,740
Have you seen how much she's ate?

339
00:16:59,740 --> 00:17:01,500
The bell rings and she tells us to wait.

340
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:03,880
Like bitch, I'm not about to be late.

341
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:06,180
And then they repeat it.

342
00:17:06,180 --> 00:17:07,940
If you don't get it, just let me restate.

343
00:17:07,940 --> 00:17:09,740
This one is kind of bars.

344
00:17:09,740 --> 00:17:10,740
Yeah, it is.

345
00:17:10,740 --> 00:17:13,300
You know, this one's kind of a little bit bars.

346
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:14,300
I agree.

347
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:17,460
I think that's kind of what poetry is about, is bars.

348
00:17:17,460 --> 00:17:18,460
I mean, yeah.

349
00:17:18,460 --> 00:17:20,980
Poetry is kind of, yeah, poetry is bars.

350
00:17:20,980 --> 00:17:22,620
William Shakespeare had bars.

351
00:17:22,620 --> 00:17:23,620
Yeah.

352
00:17:23,620 --> 00:17:27,540
That's what my teacher told me at my inner city school.

353
00:17:27,540 --> 00:17:30,940
- When he came, when he taught there for two weeks?

354
00:17:30,940 --> 00:17:32,020
- Yeah. - The substitute.

355
00:17:32,020 --> 00:17:32,860
- Substitute, yeah.

356
00:17:32,860 --> 00:17:34,860
- Yeah, well you went to the school of rap.

357
00:17:34,860 --> 00:17:36,820
- Yeah, I did. - Yeah.

358
00:17:36,820 --> 00:17:37,660
With blackjack.

359
00:17:37,660 --> 00:17:39,900
(laughing)

360
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:57,700
Oh my god, dude. That's like, that's the modern like, the starving games that we need.

361
00:17:57,700 --> 00:18:01,700
That's the new like, parody at the school.

362
00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:02,700
Blackjack.

363
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:06,400
Oh fuck, I'm so good sometimes.

364
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:06,900
Okay.

365
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:13,400
I have a poem here from, this is a poem from Demon Lover.

366
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:14,200
Oh god.

367
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:19,700
And let me show you guys his photo real quick. That is Demon Lover.

368
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:22,420
Oh my god, he's got full Darth Maul makeup.

369
00:18:22,420 --> 00:18:25,220
Yeah, he's in a... well, it's like a reverse Darth Maul,

370
00:18:25,220 --> 00:18:28,020
'cause he's like red with black on his face.

371
00:18:28,020 --> 00:18:30,420
He's like the insidious monster.

372
00:18:30,420 --> 00:18:32,420
This is his bio.

373
00:18:32,420 --> 00:18:36,980
"Hello, I am Mike Leap. I'm 22 years old. I live in Pittsburgh.

374
00:18:36,980 --> 00:18:39,060
I'm engaged to my beautiful wife, Cherise.

375
00:18:39,060 --> 00:18:41,220
We've been together for four years and still counting.

376
00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:45,460
I already had an account on here, but I created this one

377
00:18:45,460 --> 00:18:47,860
because I can't remember my password and username.

378
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:51,260
But yes, if you want to know more about me, please go ahead and message me.

379
00:18:51,260 --> 00:18:52,660
I'm very easygoing and friendly.

380
00:18:52,660 --> 00:18:56,360
And oh, my profile picture is my face painted from Halloween this year.

381
00:18:56,360 --> 00:18:58,660
Here's his poem.

382
00:18:58,660 --> 00:19:02,060
Yeah, an angel and a demon forbid in love.

383
00:19:02,060 --> 00:19:02,760
Okay.

384
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:03,160
Yeah.

385
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:05,260
I mean, you only imagine right?

386
00:19:05,260 --> 00:19:09,860
Yeah, I am a demon from the depths of hell, but you have captured me in your

387
00:19:09,860 --> 00:19:10,560
spell.

388
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:12,860
You are an angel that fell from the sky.

389
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:15,360
I have caught you and help you to fly.

390
00:19:15,660 --> 00:19:20,340
You are an angel with all your beauty, for I will protect you because it is my duty.

391
00:19:20,340 --> 00:19:22,740
I am a demon with my dark charm.

392
00:19:22,740 --> 00:19:25,220
You have helped and held my arm.

393
00:19:25,220 --> 00:19:34,380
I am a demon with wings like a bat, and have dark eyes almost like a cat.

394
00:19:34,380 --> 00:19:41,500
You are an angel with beautiful white wings, shining so bright like a diamond in rings.

395
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:47,340
We glide through the sky and through the clouds, past the sun and all the crowds.

396
00:19:47,340 --> 00:19:51,380
Our love is said to be forbidden, but we shall not be hidden.

397
00:19:51,380 --> 00:19:56,140
An angel and a demon that we are, but our love for each other will take us far.

398
00:19:56,140 --> 00:20:01,860
There is one more thing before I go, for I know our hearts will forever glow.

399
00:20:01,860 --> 00:20:04,860
So I think a lot of his things are demon-themed.

400
00:20:04,860 --> 00:20:07,580
Yeah, well that was gorgeous.

401
00:20:07,580 --> 00:20:11,460
I mean I could tell you were I mean captured by fits of emotion even halfway

402
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:15,220
through the poem. I was crying. You know when you see someone doing some kind of poetry and they're like

403
00:20:15,220 --> 00:20:18,220
like between the whole lines right? They're like...

404
00:20:18,220 --> 00:20:24,900
We need to do that. Yeah. I have actually you know I have some emotional ones

405
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:28,500
coming up. Really? I don't know if you... I have another one from the demon lover here.

406
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:32,700
I'd love to hear more from demon lover though. Because this is uh... It's interesting that he is a

407
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:37,260
demon but he's... He's a demon and a lover. Yeah. So he doesn't love demons he is a

408
00:20:37,260 --> 00:20:44,460
demon. He's a demon lover. Oh. And this next poem, this next poem will, yeah, like

409
00:20:44,460 --> 00:20:50,560
like he's a demon who has sex. This next poem really, really illustrates it. Okay.

410
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:55,720
Really gets the point across. Yeah, let's hear it. It's called "Love is my drug."

411
00:20:55,720 --> 00:21:01,840
They can get high smoking what the will, maybe even pop a pill, cut some lines and

412
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:07,020
then snort them up, or maybe even take a syringe and shoot it up, but love is my

413
00:21:07,020 --> 00:21:14,980
drug. They can drink a few beers and have a good time but all I will ever need is

414
00:21:14,980 --> 00:21:20,740
for you to remain mine. They can laugh and shout and do what they want but love

415
00:21:20,740 --> 00:21:27,340
is my drug. They can do any drug that they may see but all I can ask for you is to

416
00:21:27,340 --> 00:21:32,500
stay with me. Love will never kill you it will make you want more but that's not

417
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:41,700
bad for without love in the world I would be sad love is my drug that I take and it

418
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:48,580
will never be a mistake for I can take as much as I please just like the air that

419
00:21:48,580 --> 00:21:54,860
I breathe love is my drug I think I'm coming out of my writer's block now so

420
00:21:54,860 --> 00:22:00,860
yeah tell me what you think I mean that's good dude it's yeah clear than

421
00:22:00,860 --> 00:22:05,060
I mean that's how he feels you know and that's what the important part of poetry is.

422
00:22:05,060 --> 00:22:06,060
Absolutely.

423
00:22:06,060 --> 00:22:07,060
Talking about how you feel.

424
00:22:07,060 --> 00:22:08,060
Yeah.

425
00:22:08,060 --> 00:22:11,780
So speaking of, so this is one last one by Joe Fettig.

426
00:22:11,780 --> 00:22:12,780
Okay.

427
00:22:12,780 --> 00:22:13,780
Okay.

428
00:22:13,780 --> 00:22:14,780
Yeah.

429
00:22:14,780 --> 00:22:15,780
So the last one was One Blowjob Away.

430
00:22:15,780 --> 00:22:16,780
You guys remember that?

431
00:22:16,780 --> 00:22:18,020
Oh I remember it.

432
00:22:18,020 --> 00:22:21,460
So this one is Two Blowjobs Away.

433
00:22:21,460 --> 00:22:22,460
You ready?

434
00:22:22,460 --> 00:22:23,460
There's a sequel?

435
00:22:23,460 --> 00:22:24,460
I'm ready.

436
00:22:24,460 --> 00:22:26,700
Two Blowjobs Away.

437
00:22:26,700 --> 00:22:28,220
Or is this a prequel?

438
00:22:28,220 --> 00:22:29,940
It came out after so it is a sequel.

439
00:22:29,940 --> 00:22:34,720
But it has to be a prequel. Yeah, unless he yeah, you're right. He's yelled out. Does that make sense?

440
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:39,860
I am to blow jobs away from leaving the plantation does she spit or swallow?

441
00:22:39,860 --> 00:22:43,140
I am the dominant one so you need to get on your knees and follow

442
00:22:43,140 --> 00:22:46,040
Why have one blowjob a day when you could have to?

443
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:54,260
She needs to suck that dick until her face turns blue

444
00:22:54,260 --> 00:22:59,020
She wants to be loved but is she swallowing the sperm sucking fuck every day

445
00:22:59,020 --> 00:23:02,700
We can make this relationship long-term get your ass butt naked

446
00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:06,360
I'm gonna smash that pussy in between the sheets you better submit to me

447
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:10,580
Or I will throw your ass back in the streets you dream about having romance and love

448
00:23:10,580 --> 00:23:14,900
I just want sex I pull your hair and bid your ass over then I put on the latex

449
00:23:14,900 --> 00:23:20,020
Smashing that ass I'm making you moan loving that good dick. I'm gonna make you sweat all night

450
00:23:20,020 --> 00:23:25,500
You are an obedient side chick. I pull out then you start sucking my dick waiting for that eruption of joy

451
00:23:26,020 --> 00:23:29,220
Swallow my sperm. I know you're a freak. I am your fuck boy

452
00:23:29,220 --> 00:23:35,480
I am to blow jobs away from taking the red pill hookers are cheaper than girlfriends. That's the power of free will

453
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:38,300
damn

454
00:23:38,300 --> 00:23:44,780
Wow, dude, why I mean why I have two jobs or why have one blowjob a day when you can have to I think he wrote

455
00:23:44,780 --> 00:23:46,780
One is a job

456
00:23:46,780 --> 00:23:49,940
To blow job

457
00:23:49,940 --> 00:23:51,940
Fuck I'm lowballing here. I got a

458
00:23:51,940 --> 00:23:55,420
Yeah, two blowjobs is three times better than one blowjob

459
00:23:55,420 --> 00:24:06,020
Yeah, that was very powerful. I yeah, I mean also how you can you disagree with that right really?

460
00:24:06,020 --> 00:24:14,180
Is better than one and it's better than zero, you know to blow jobs and it's worse than three. It's much worse

461
00:24:14,180 --> 00:24:17,060
It's three. I'm gonna be walking around exhausted all day

462
00:24:17,060 --> 00:24:20,520
Like I just come I come three times a day all out of me

463
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:22,320
I might as well just eating Thanksgiving dinner

464
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:26,600
Like I'm just walking around just like holding my body. Yeah, just like oh

465
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:34,520
I just sit down. I don't even watch football sit down on a couch fall asleep watching football

466
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:38,160
That's what I have absolutely have to walk around with my belt loosened like yeah

467
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:41,620
I'm unbuttoning the top button and shit

468
00:24:41,620 --> 00:24:47,960
That's a I mean coming three times a day is just that's too much. It's just gonna bad zone. It's way too much

469
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:52,240
much. I have two poems here that I'd like to share in a row. They're by different

470
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:54,640
authors, but I feel like they make good companion pieces.

471
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:55,240
Okay.

472
00:24:55,240 --> 00:25:00,320
This first one is by the user Angel of the Shadows, who I'll just read their bio

473
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:03,560
for you. I think it's a really... The bio is kind of a poem in itself.

474
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:04,280
Oh, okay.

475
00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:08,160
I am a dark being. Most people do not know me because they are afraid. Just one

476
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:11,640
little tip, do not try and hurt me or my family without knowing what I'm capable

477
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:16,240
of. And this poem is called Phantom, and this is an acrostic poem where the first

478
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:19,840
the letter of each line spells something out. So you know it

479
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:22,560
doesn't say like the let all just like I'll say like P is for

480
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:25,340
you know, but it doesn't say that in the poem just so you

481
00:25:25,340 --> 00:25:28,140
know, so everyone at home can understand what's going on here.

482
00:25:28,140 --> 00:25:34,000
P is for painful moans be whale H is for haunts torment a is for

483
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:38,740
awful tragedies mumble and is for nameless horrors. Howell t

484
00:25:38,740 --> 00:25:42,380
is for threatening yells shout. Oh is for observant phantoms

485
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:45,560
own and M is for major scares bother

486
00:25:45,560 --> 00:25:50,160
and then this this other one I'd like to read

487
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:59,240
the title is poem is breakfast by blue moon boy. He looks like a very nice

488
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:00,900
young. He looks really sweet

489
00:26:00,900 --> 00:26:05,160
and I believe these poems are kind of like a yin and yang. They show the two

490
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:08,960
sides of life. Can you read his bio? Yeah, hi there. I am blue moon boy and I

491
00:26:08,980 --> 00:26:12,180
love to write and read. I live in the country India and I'm an 11 year old

492
00:26:12,180 --> 00:26:15,100
kid. So here's breakfast by Blue Moon Boy

493
00:26:15,100 --> 00:26:22,280
hot fresh pancakes drizzled with maple syrup with warm white milk served in a

494
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:23,600
long large cup

495
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:30,900
a scrumptious cheese sandwich and finally at last to yummy tasty biscuit

496
00:26:30,900 --> 00:26:32,940
is my idea for breakfast

497
00:26:33,900 --> 00:26:39,460
then his comments prompt is "what do you mean by breakfast?" right in the comments

498
00:26:39,460 --> 00:26:44,580
yeah he I mean he's very talented yeah he's kind of a prodigy yeah oh yeah I

499
00:26:44,580 --> 00:26:48,900
think that's the phantom or the demon what's his name angel of... he needs to

500
00:26:48,900 --> 00:26:53,580
take... angel of darkness needs to take him under or Blue Moon Boys needs to take angel of

501
00:26:53,580 --> 00:26:57,380
darkness under his wing. I think they could both teach each other a little bit

502
00:26:57,380 --> 00:27:04,940
about my demonic breakfast. Two evil eggs served hell side up. It has to spell

503
00:27:04,940 --> 00:27:10,780
something. Bacon deep-fried. That's true. Imagine if that poem had spelled breakfast. In lava.

504
00:27:10,780 --> 00:27:22,220
One cup of blood orange juice and two pieces of toast and they're burnt too.

505
00:27:22,220 --> 00:27:25,660
That was a poem by me. That was beautiful. You should be the Hell Breakfast Boy.

506
00:27:25,660 --> 00:27:32,300
The Hell Breakfast Boy. I have another, I have a poem here. This is another person who

507
00:27:32,300 --> 00:27:38,620
just looks at like a photo and then writes their poem based on the photo.

508
00:27:38,620 --> 00:27:41,500
A picture is worth a thousand poems. That's what people say.

509
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:45,340
It's a gift. Poems are terrible. Let me read her bio first.

510
00:27:45,340 --> 00:27:50,300
Actually, I don't need to read this bio. It's not that good. There is just like a bunch of

511
00:27:51,420 --> 00:27:54,780
photos. Oh that's beautiful. Yeah it's a very beautiful, there's a picture of a butterfly.

512
00:27:54,780 --> 00:28:02,620
Oh look how beautiful that is. Yeah, but the photo that this is a, this is a kind of a raunchy

513
00:28:02,620 --> 00:28:11,900
poem it's called XXX Wham Bam Thank You Lamb and the inspiration for this poem was a gif

514
00:28:11,900 --> 00:28:21,260
of Kermit the Frog fucking a lamb puppet. And let me just get right into this. Intraspecies

515
00:28:21,260 --> 00:28:28,540
coitus never results in a foetus. I'm just trying to make the rhyme work.

516
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:35,460
It's a fetus. Yeah. So it saves sex in at least one way and it's got to make for

517
00:28:35,460 --> 00:28:40,660
unique play but you got to watch which species you choose and the precautions

518
00:28:40,660 --> 00:28:47,100
that you use. So there's this horny frog his dick was feeling like a log. I mean

519
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:52,060
that hopping boner would just not go away he'd been hanging at his pad but he got

520
00:28:52,060 --> 00:28:58,400
to feeling bad so he went out for some so he went out looking for some illicit

521
00:28:58,400 --> 00:29:03,220
intercourse he spelled illicit wrong with dick in hand he sailed forth and soon

522
00:29:03,220 --> 00:29:07,780
came upon a horse but he found out that he couldn't hop that high so reluctantly

523
00:29:07,780 --> 00:29:13,380
he turned away by telling the horsey bye-bye swinging his head his way and

524
00:29:13,380 --> 00:29:20,340
that as his boner grew more fat. He almost settled on a big disgusting sow then his

525
00:29:20,340 --> 00:29:27,220
eyes lit up and he shouted, "Oh wow!" He had spied a sweet little lamb. He grabbed it

526
00:29:27,220 --> 00:29:33,820
and then bam bam wham wham bam with a sigh he pulled out saying, "Thank you lamb."

527
00:29:33,820 --> 00:29:43,180
and the comment prompt is what do you think that's pretty good that's

528
00:29:43,180 --> 00:29:48,300
disgusting you it was a good it was a good story that says a man I don't know

529
00:29:48,300 --> 00:29:55,700
I'll applaud just for the pic poems good too so this is from so there's this

530
00:29:55,700 --> 00:30:01,740
this person pink fairy 5 on here uh-huh and I was looking at her profile and she

531
00:30:01,740 --> 00:30:08,020
has like probably a thousand. I did see this person. Really? Yeah, every section you

532
00:30:08,020 --> 00:30:11,700
look at this person's all over the website. It's crazy. Yeah, power user. She has

533
00:30:11,700 --> 00:30:16,900
like a thousand poems and a large chunk of them are about her husband walking up

534
00:30:16,900 --> 00:30:23,300
behind her and grabbing her 44 double D breasts. Like there's like probably

535
00:30:23,300 --> 00:30:27,220
30 different poems and they're all super super long. Yeah. So I didn't pick them

536
00:30:27,220 --> 00:30:30,620
out because it's really just it's just like my husband grabbed my breasts and

537
00:30:30,620 --> 00:30:35,620
just kept holding them so this is one that she has that was between so it was

538
00:30:35,620 --> 00:30:40,460
sandwiched on her profile between two of those it's called not always a symbol of

539
00:30:40,460 --> 00:30:49,060
evil mm-hmm the swastika was not always a symbol of evil but once it became one

540
00:30:49,060 --> 00:30:53,180
there was no turning back that's the entire

541
00:30:58,620 --> 00:31:04,360
And she immediately right after wrote another one about her husband grabbing, this one was

542
00:31:04,360 --> 00:31:08,020
he was pretending she had a tick on her breast and then he grabbed it and then she started

543
00:31:08,020 --> 00:31:10,420
holding her.

544
00:31:10,420 --> 00:31:11,420
That's really something.

545
00:31:11,420 --> 00:31:12,420
Kind of a beautiful relationship.

546
00:31:12,420 --> 00:31:13,420
It kind of is.

547
00:31:13,420 --> 00:31:17,060
Because poetry is about love but it also is just love.

548
00:31:17,060 --> 00:31:18,580
Yeah absolutely.

549
00:31:18,580 --> 00:31:21,260
Now that one was kind of silly.

550
00:31:21,260 --> 00:31:24,500
I do want to read a more serious one if you guys are down with that.

551
00:31:24,500 --> 00:31:27,260
A little bit sad.

552
00:31:27,260 --> 00:31:29,760
This one's called At The Gas Station Pumps.

553
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:31,760
Oh, okay.

554
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:33,620
By Brian Shaw.

555
00:31:33,620 --> 00:31:37,340
Across from me, she looked at me like I was a ghost or something.

556
00:31:37,340 --> 00:31:39,860
I know I look different with long hair.

557
00:31:39,860 --> 00:31:45,720
I'm skin and bones and lost at least 20 pounds, but can you stop staring at me, please?

558
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:50,440
It seems like you're looking right through me, even though three years ago we were sharing

559
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:56,220
a bed together watching the world crumble to pieces in the movie Idiocracy on Netflix.

560
00:31:56,220 --> 00:32:01,340
where the hell were you when my world was crumbling all around me? She had all my

561
00:32:01,340 --> 00:32:05,980
social media, my phone number. I'm sure she heard all about my long battle with

562
00:32:05,980 --> 00:32:10,900
COVID. Everyone in this community has. The least she could have done was said

563
00:32:10,900 --> 00:32:18,780
something, waved, talk to me, but some things are too hard these days.

564
00:32:18,780 --> 00:32:23,740
That's kind of written like a tool song right there. It's like the...

565
00:32:23,980 --> 00:32:28,220
yet it is a beautiful like the way that it is a nice to look at you know

566
00:32:28,220 --> 00:32:33,980
it's very gorgeous it is a gorgeous one ninety ninety spoken word poet

567
00:32:33,980 --> 00:32:36,600
uh... poem here this is by uh...

568
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:39,420
by cats meow

569
00:32:39,420 --> 00:32:44,260
uh... in the title is madonna's at it again

570
00:32:44,260 --> 00:32:45,440
and uh...

571
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:50,540
the c cats now doesn't have a bio but he's a he's an old man from england

572
00:32:50,540 --> 00:32:52,700
nice of the u_k_

573
00:32:52,700 --> 00:32:56,420
And this poem is, Madonna's at it again.

574
00:32:56,420 --> 00:33:00,780
I see Madonna is ranting again and being bitchy.

575
00:33:00,780 --> 00:33:05,860
No wonder her 20 husbands have pissed off, including Guy Ritchie.

576
00:33:05,860 --> 00:33:10,500
Saying that she'd like to blow up the new president in the White House.

577
00:33:10,500 --> 00:33:14,740
She's used to blowing off men in the wrinkly old shite house.

578
00:33:14,740 --> 00:33:19,500
You should see her scream and shout.

579
00:33:20,020 --> 00:33:23,820
Does she want the publicity because she's got a crappy album coming out?

580
00:33:23,820 --> 00:33:27,720
With her champagne lifestyle, she thinks herself smart.

581
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:31,020
But she has all the eloquence of a horse's fart.

582
00:33:31,020 --> 00:33:34,320
Oh my god, don't go there.

583
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:36,420
Inspiring. Very funny, Michael.

584
00:33:36,420 --> 00:33:42,820
Whenever I see her, now, it will be a horse fart.

585
00:33:42,820 --> 00:33:47,720
Alright, I'm going to do this one and then I just remembered one that I'm going to try to find here in a minute

586
00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:51,240
that I think you guys will really like. Speaking of old British men. Okay. But this one is

587
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:58,200
this one is actually because like we talked about like like rap is poetry. Absolutely. It is a kind

588
00:33:58,200 --> 00:34:05,960
of poetry. So this one is by Papa Mama Jama. Okay. And this is called rap. Okay.

589
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:13,480
Hola Papa Mama Jama the great alpha wolf lyrical gangster, alma chocolate maestro extraordinaire,

590
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:16,000
Mastering the art of oratorial cornucopia

591
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,240
Charismatic syntax, lethal friction

592
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:19,940
Hot, sweet, and rolling off the tongue

593
00:34:19,940 --> 00:34:22,880
The celebrity of dictation and sight deliberation

594
00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:25,720
In the prefrontal cortex region (head)

595
00:34:25,720 --> 00:34:28,680
And until they pass him oratorium, banning oral

596
00:34:28,680 --> 00:34:31,220
He got them shaking and gyrating, begging for more

597
00:34:31,220 --> 00:34:33,680
Verbal ambrosia, from sea to shining shore

598
00:34:33,680 --> 00:34:36,580
He's giving love to the wannabes who don't want yore from yore

599
00:34:36,580 --> 00:34:38,080
He was it, Shakespeare who said

600
00:34:38,080 --> 00:34:40,080
They tryna muddy the motherfucking water

601
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:41,680
To make their shit rhymes sound deeper

602
00:34:41,680 --> 00:34:44,760
know my mistake that could have been Eminem or Tupac who said that anyway

603
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:49,240
it's something remotivally relevant don't just squawk and grab your vacuous

604
00:34:49,240 --> 00:34:54,360

yeah I've got I've got some with two sides here too actually this is from user

615
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:37,240
Better not be Dr. Jekyll.

616
00:35:37,240 --> 00:35:38,740
Whatever666.

617
00:35:38,740 --> 00:35:40,540
Which, check out this profile picture.

618
00:35:40,540 --> 00:35:41,540
Oh my god.

619
00:35:41,540 --> 00:35:43,040
Man, he really doesn't give a fuck.

620
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:44,040
He's fucking scary, bro.

621
00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:46,240
She's fucking scary.

622
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:47,740
I'll read this.

623
00:35:47,740 --> 00:35:51,340
I have two poems I'll read from Whatever666 to kind of showcase her two sides.

624
00:35:51,340 --> 00:35:53,140
This one is called "Am I Still Yours?"

625
00:35:53,140 --> 00:35:56,940
I'll be found in the fraggle tube.

626
00:35:56,940 --> 00:35:58,940
My curly smarkle laugh is gone.

627
00:35:58,940 --> 00:36:00,740
Toot-a-roo, we never said again.

628
00:36:00,740 --> 00:36:02,200
Thought we'd go to Farklip.

629
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:04,200
Didn't even make it to Snoodleflurp.

630
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:07,640
go to woozen fart split in whamper slip. We're in our

631
00:36:07,640 --> 00:36:12,340
booble right full of a mess. It's a shame of Humper Wump from the

632
00:36:12,340 --> 00:36:15,440
Uzi Wuzi. I had though. I'm dead. Am I still your girl?

633
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:22,400
So that's that's am I still yours by whatever 666 and then I

634
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:25,140
like to segue immediately into don't ask questions. If you

635
00:36:25,140 --> 00:36:29,600
can't stand the truth in poetic form. Okay, here we go. This

636
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:31,760
one's a little bit long, but I think you're gonna I think it's

637
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:36,560
worth it. If I could kill someone and get away with it, yes, without a doubt. If I had the

638
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:40,280
chance to change anything in my past, I would charge up to my birth father and yell, "Fuck

639
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:44,280
you," to his face. Is there a God? Yes, I believe there is, but we've shut him out of our daily

640
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:47,780
lives. Then wonder why God's not there when we want him to be. As for what I think the

641
00:36:47,780 --> 00:36:52,700
afterlife life is like, peaceful bliss, belonging. As for my opinion on the meaning of life,

642
00:36:52,700 --> 00:36:56,800
live it to the fullest. Do what others say you can't to push the envelope without being

643
00:36:56,800 --> 00:37:01,400
illegal. Am I pro or anti-gun? And why pro-gun? Because I want to be able to defend myself.

644
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:03,280
Secondly, it's our right to bear arms.

645
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:05,520
In the event of martial law, I would go off the grid.

646
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:06,960
The government keeps screwing things up

647
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:08,720
while murders get out of jail free.

648
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:11,020
Would I cheat on my other half if could?

649
00:37:11,020 --> 00:37:12,760
I don't have to worry because I'm never, never,

650
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:15,320
never, ever going to get a boyfriend or get married.

651
00:37:15,320 --> 00:37:17,520
If my soul was mirror, would I like what I saw?

652
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:18,360
Probably not.

653
00:37:18,360 --> 00:37:20,360
I don't even like what I see in an everyday mirror.

654
00:37:20,360 --> 00:37:22,680
For the poor pedestrian I hit on that deserted road,

655
00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:25,080
I told not just whoever may read these words,

656
00:37:25,080 --> 00:37:27,560
but also the authorities on the next town I entered.

657
00:37:27,560 --> 00:37:29,880
As for parallel universes, yes, I believe in them.

658
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:30,700
As for what they're like,

659
00:37:30,700 --> 00:37:34,460
Well in this universe you might be fat, so in the parallel world you're thin, yet in another

660
00:37:34,460 --> 00:37:37,300
you might be all muscle, you might be rich or a bum.

661
00:37:37,300 --> 00:37:40,840
If I've ever seen a ghost or experienced a supernatural event, well, I used to live in

662
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:45,120
a haunted duplex in Waterloo, Iowa, the ghost was cool, picture frames would be moved back

663
00:37:45,120 --> 00:37:47,080
the way they were before they were dusted.

664
00:37:47,080 --> 00:37:50,420
As for what I would do if I had five minutes left to live, that's easy, I'd write my will

665
00:37:50,420 --> 00:37:53,820
with slop job handwriting, leaving it for the family and friends to decipher.

666
00:37:53,820 --> 00:37:57,500
If the cost of one thousand strangers lasted to delay my own death or a loved one's life,

667
00:37:57,500 --> 00:38:00,300
No, I would rather die on that day of my death than to sacrifice others

668
00:38:00,300 --> 00:38:03,500
And no, I'd rather have to say goodbye to my loved one than one thousand strangers

669
00:38:03,500 --> 00:38:05,300
No, I haven't ever experienced true love

670
00:38:05,300 --> 00:38:07,300
In order to know it was true love, I'd have to be in love

671
00:38:07,300 --> 00:38:09,800
And not just asked out on a prank or wanted just to have sex

672
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:12,400
When asked if I believe animals have souls, I invariably answer

673
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:15,100
Yes, just look into their eyes and you'll see there's unconditional love

674
00:38:15,100 --> 00:38:18,700
If reincarnation is true, I think I was a woman who was murdered for being a smartass to the men

675
00:38:18,700 --> 00:38:21,200
And I think I will be even more of a smartass in the next life

676
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:22,800
As for believing in aliens, yes I do

677
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:26,600
There's so much space that we can't explore due to radiation that will kill us outside Earth's atmosphere

678
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:28,900
And when asked how corrupt is our government, it's very corrupt.

679
00:38:28,900 --> 00:38:30,900
Why else does money talk as bullshit walks?

680
00:38:30,900 --> 00:38:32,500
I'll do those bastards in office.

681
00:38:32,500 --> 00:38:35,800
At last, love is like a vampire, drains the life right out of you.

682
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:39,000
Oh my fucking God Almighty, dude.

683
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:43,000
I love that she threw in that she hit a pedestrian with a car.

684
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:47,500
Well, just yeah, like, yeah, she was so wracked with guilt that she had to tell somebody

685
00:38:47,500 --> 00:38:50,300
and she was like, I'll sandwich it between this shit.

686
00:38:50,300 --> 00:38:53,100
Very smart to put it in the middle of the poem

687
00:38:53,100 --> 00:38:56,140
so that people who are just skimming it wouldn't notice it. Yeah, exactly.

688
00:38:56,140 --> 00:39:02,940
Yeah, no it was very, it was beautiful. I have a poem here. This is somebody

689
00:39:02,940 --> 00:39:10,220
that I found. Her name is Miss Sexy. You found her? Yeah, I found Miss Sexy. Damn.

690
00:39:10,220 --> 00:39:16,780
And her profile picture is a photo of her with the word sexy on top of it, like kind of like Kendrick

691
00:39:16,780 --> 00:39:22,460
Lamar "Damn." Oh yeah, it does look like that. She is sexy. Yeah. She's got platinum hair. And

692
00:39:22,460 --> 00:39:25,700
And here's a poem by Miss Sexy called,

693
00:39:25,700 --> 00:39:28,240
I have two poems by Miss Sexy,

694
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:29,460
one of them's very short,

695
00:39:29,460 --> 00:39:32,940
and this one is more of an introduction to Miss Sexy.

696
00:39:32,940 --> 00:39:36,980
So these are Miss Sexy's icebreaker poems.

697
00:39:36,980 --> 00:39:40,220
This one is She's So Sexy by Miss Sexy.

698
00:39:40,220 --> 00:39:44,260
She's absolutely marvelous.

699
00:39:44,260 --> 00:39:46,420
The way she talks is just so unique.

700
00:39:46,420 --> 00:39:49,540
Her words are like chocolate, so creamy and sweet.

701
00:39:49,540 --> 00:39:51,920
She's so sexy from her head to her feet.

702
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:57,200
perfection she's good enough to eat miss sexy is her name absolute is what I

703
00:39:57,200 --> 00:40:02,720
called her if given a chance I would pamper and love her damn she's so sexy

704
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:08,880
she's so fine a work of art so pure and divine I wrote this poem from the depths

705
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:16,080
of my mind so pardon me if it doesn't rhyme but damn she's just so sexy damn

706

712
00:40:54,420 --> 00:41:04,300
five. She sent her man a poem that was called my top four. So I found this guy, his name

713
00:41:04,300 --> 00:41:15,020
is Grey Wolf 1957. Ah, chapel fan. Yeah. And his, he has 1800 poems on here. Wow. He's

714
00:41:15,020 --> 00:41:22,940
a metal worker. He lives in the UK. He says that he's been a slave for 20 years and

715
00:41:22,940 --> 00:41:28,300
that he's going to keep being a slave until he dies. And this is one of his...

716
00:41:28,300 --> 00:41:32,340
this is one called "Love is a Fragile Flower Opening to the Warmth of Spring."

717
00:41:32,340 --> 00:41:37,060
Okay, I already like this. This is a short one. "That warmth turning into fiery

718
00:41:37,060 --> 00:41:40,660
flames, strong emotions that weave overwhelming joy, that amazing moment

719
00:41:40,660 --> 00:41:43,620
when it dawns upon you, when your heart begins to collect what it yearns for,

720
00:41:43,620 --> 00:41:47,560
happiness beginning to contour adding dimension that love that lingers even

721
00:41:47,560 --> 00:41:50,700
when you are apart like that fragile flower opening to the warmth of spring

722
00:41:50,700 --> 00:41:54,280
love is blossoming and love is the only way so that's very pretty that is very

723
00:41:54,280 --> 00:41:58,860
beautiful I I wanted to see what this guy was all about he has a bunch of links in

724
00:41:58,860 --> 00:42:05,900
his bio one of them is a link to a YouTube channel that has him reading

725
00:42:05,900 --> 00:42:14,840
every single one of his poems and also hot sauce challenges. So here's another

726
00:42:14,840 --> 00:42:20,720
poem by him okay this one is called the Reaper. I have tried so many

727
00:42:20,720 --> 00:42:25,600
different peppers, some delicately flavored, others hot as hell. There were

728
00:42:25,600 --> 00:42:29,760
those that made me laugh and cry, each one with its own unique smell. The simple

729
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:33,840
jalapeno was the start of the chili madness I was in, followed by ghost

730
00:42:33,840 --> 00:42:39,640
I just knew I had to win so many chili challenges out there with warnings of what laid within the chocolate

731
00:42:39,640 --> 00:42:44,880
Boudjiello Kia was an insane type of pepper sin the scorpion chili was the next to fall

732
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:50,220
This one really made me sweat a burn like I had never experienced before I had to do it as I had made a bet

733
00:42:50,220 --> 00:42:53,160
Even my tears were scorching hot the hiccups wouldn't go away

734
00:42:53,160 --> 00:42:59,080
I put the toilet roll in the fridge as ring sting would be there that day then in one moment of pure madness

735
00:42:59,480 --> 00:43:01,480
Carolina Reaper was there in my sight.

736
00:43:01,480 --> 00:43:01,980
Oh my god.

737
00:43:01,980 --> 00:43:03,480
I psyched myself up to eat it.

738
00:43:03,480 --> 00:43:05,480
I had one hell of a night.

739
00:43:05,480 --> 00:43:08,480
My tears once again were burning, my urine became molten in heat,

740
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:10,480
my mouth burned like the fires of hell,

741
00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:12,480
in the morning I would be in for a treat.

742
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:15,480
Never before had a ring sting been so intense.

743
00:43:15,480 --> 00:43:17,480
I heard sounds like I shouldn't have oughta.

744
00:43:17,480 --> 00:43:21,480
Then I realized it was just my sphincter going down to drink some water.

745
00:43:21,480 --> 00:43:23,480
[laughter]

746
00:43:23,480 --> 00:43:24,480
So...

747
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:25,480
That was beautiful.

748
00:43:25,480 --> 00:43:28,480
He's bea- he also- I found him from a poem called "Grandma Fart Attack".

749
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:34,680
This guy does not this guy shouldn't be a slave he we should free he's I mean he

750
00:43:34,680 --> 00:43:39,080
he's like one of the most like masters of all time right like this guy should be

751
00:43:39,080 --> 00:43:42,800
this guy should be the top of the top should be well you know what they say is

752
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:46,640
like good art comes from pain and that that ring-sting sounds like it really

753
00:43:46,640 --> 00:43:51,560
hurt that's why he makes such beautiful shit yeah yeah yeah from his ass come on

754
00:43:51,560 --> 00:43:55,840
his damn asshole oh yeah something I forgot to mention about whatever 666 is

755
00:43:55,840 --> 00:43:58,780
is that most of her poems in the inspiration section,

756
00:43:58,780 --> 00:44:01,200
she just attaches Tom McDonald raps.

757
00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:02,040
- Oh, sick.

758
00:44:02,040 --> 00:44:06,540
- Yeah, so I wanna share another user that I found here.

759
00:44:06,540 --> 00:44:09,680
This is The Devil's Wife.

760
00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:10,840
- Whoa, what?

761
00:44:10,840 --> 00:44:11,960
- I'm scared.

762
00:44:11,960 --> 00:44:14,800
- Her profile picture is an impact font meme

763
00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:16,480
of a lion made of fire that says,

764
00:44:16,480 --> 00:44:18,040
"Don't take my kindness for weakness.

765
00:44:18,040 --> 00:44:20,100
"The beast in me is sleeping, not dead."

766
00:44:20,100 --> 00:44:23,160
And she basically, she writes poems and raps.

767
00:44:23,160 --> 00:44:27,560
So I have a selection here of a poem and then a few raps for you.

768
00:44:27,560 --> 00:44:28,560
Okay, cool.

769
00:44:28,560 --> 00:44:29,560
Perfect.

770
00:44:29,560 --> 00:44:34,520
Yeah, so this is The Dark Side to Me by Devil's Wife.

771
00:44:34,520 --> 00:44:38,080
Imagine liking solitude to the point you become colder than ice.

772
00:44:38,080 --> 00:44:41,600
Imagine having a rage that's darker than all the powers of hell.

773
00:44:41,600 --> 00:44:45,440
Imagine being full of life and giving life one day, having no desire to live or see things

774
00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:47,120
live the next.

775
00:44:47,120 --> 00:44:50,680
Imagine being a being of light, but that light is nothing but darkness.

776
00:44:50,680 --> 00:44:53,100
That is the dark side of an empath.

777
00:44:53,100 --> 00:44:54,100
Fuck.

778
00:44:54,100 --> 00:44:55,100
Yeah.

779
00:44:55,100 --> 00:45:00,640
Now wait till you hear this rap by Devil's Wife called 911 Rap.

780
00:45:00,640 --> 00:45:01,640
Okay.

781
00:45:01,640 --> 00:45:03,000
Yeah, put your hands in the air.

782
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:04,440
I'm gonna show you unfair.

783
00:45:04,440 --> 00:45:05,920
Watch me take this beat to the street.

784
00:45:05,920 --> 00:45:07,440
I'm about to make you taste defeat.

785
00:45:07,440 --> 00:45:11,320
I'm the Jack back in black, diamond ring Pontiac and Cadillac.

786
00:45:11,320 --> 00:45:12,940
From this madness, there is no coping.

787
00:45:12,940 --> 00:45:14,600
On shooting stars, I'll have you hoping.

788
00:45:14,600 --> 00:45:18,080
I'll show you how to go pro once I set the stage with my fiery flow.

789
00:45:18,080 --> 00:45:19,080
Whoa.

790
00:45:19,080 --> 00:45:20,520
I'm about to call 911.

791
00:45:20,520 --> 00:45:23,880
I think that's why it's called nine one rap and now I would like to read this

792
00:45:23,880 --> 00:45:29,640
other rap by the devil's wife called this to Mr. Tom McDonald. Whoa okay,

793
00:45:29,640 --> 00:45:35,400
this one there's no line breaks. So it's kind of hard to read yeah yeah yeah.

794
00:45:35,400 --> 00:45:38,840
Yeah, I heard every one of your videos dude go ahead. Call me out and say that

795
00:45:38,840 --> 00:45:42,280
I am rude. I know you probably don't care about my diss. I know that you

796
00:45:42,280 --> 00:45:45,400
hate hip hop and you are seemingly a troll. So my favorite message to you is

797
00:45:45,400 --> 00:45:48,840
what goes around comes around. You say you are unafraid, then when Illuminati

798
00:45:48,840 --> 00:45:53,080
showed up you act all scared. If it takes words to battle you, hell, I am more than prepared.

799
00:45:53,080 --> 00:45:56,700
To stand my ground and not back down, I decided to troll the troll. Go ahead, hate me because

800
00:45:56,700 --> 00:46:00,500
I make my haters' heads roll. And yeah, for the millions of death threats being ghost stories

801
00:46:00,500 --> 00:46:03,940
when you logged in every day, I know that you are not a white boy. Your soul is as black

802
00:46:03,940 --> 00:46:07,700
as they come. And I know if you were black, you would probably look for a reason to state

803
00:46:07,700 --> 00:46:12,540
that I was politically incorrect on my diss track to you. But hey, dude, we all have buttholes.

804
00:46:12,540 --> 00:46:15,980
You stated that yourself, and I know that you are not the only corny artist in the game.

805
00:46:15,980 --> 00:46:19,140
You just met a female who loves how you play the game only to tell you that she thinks

806
00:46:19,140 --> 00:46:21,060
that your playing has lost its aim.

807
00:46:21,060 --> 00:46:22,500
So yeah my feet are not glued.

808
00:46:22,500 --> 00:46:26,260
I do know what I'm saying and yes that more than one million times you say people are

809
00:46:26,260 --> 00:46:27,420
so stupid dude.

810
00:46:27,420 --> 00:46:30,420
I am sure you are a person too but hey I could be wrong.

811
00:46:30,420 --> 00:46:32,420
You could just be a clone of you.

812
00:46:32,420 --> 00:46:33,420
Damn.

813
00:46:33,420 --> 00:46:34,420
That's fire.

814
00:46:34,420 --> 00:46:37,380
Think the Illuminati clone Tom McDonald?

815
00:46:37,380 --> 00:46:38,380
Could be.

816
00:46:38,380 --> 00:46:39,380
That's what I'm thinking.

817
00:46:39,380 --> 00:46:40,380
It could.

818
00:46:40,380 --> 00:46:42,340
That actually is kind of what that points to isn't it?

819
00:46:42,340 --> 00:46:44,060
That would make a lot of sense.

820
00:46:44,060 --> 00:46:45,300
Yeah.

821
00:46:45,300 --> 00:47:04,780
of

822
00:47:04,780 --> 00:47:10,100
companion song I don't know if you guys play the dip dip dip mm-hmm Wow

823
00:47:10,100 --> 00:47:20,260
this one is called funny bunny okay oh that mr. Bugs bunny so quintessentially

824
00:47:20,260 --> 00:47:27,500
funny he tickles my old cranium he's better than a bonbon saying what's up

825
00:47:27,500 --> 00:47:35,260
Doc cracks me up not much how about you what's up crunching carrots by the dozen

826
00:47:35,260 --> 00:47:41,260
would taste more yummy honey baked in the oven gotta love Bugs Bunny he's much

827
00:47:41,260 --> 00:47:47,580
the wiser escaping dangers on far horizons in 2030 he'll turn 100 still

828
00:47:47,580 --> 00:47:52,300
yooks looks young still turning heads damn you know honestly I think I think

829
00:47:52,300 --> 00:47:55,660
nowadays like writing poetry like that takes a lot more courage than writing

830
00:47:55,660 --> 00:47:57,280
writing like dark empath poetry.

831
00:47:57,280 --> 00:48:03,300
I agree and also like nobody cares that you like, like you like someone died in your life.

832
00:48:03,300 --> 00:48:04,300
You know what I mean?

833
00:48:04,300 --> 00:48:05,300
Yeah, I care a lot more about Bugs Bunny.

834
00:48:05,300 --> 00:48:09,380
Yeah, like Bugs Bunny like, like there's a reason why like your mom was never famous.

835
00:48:09,380 --> 00:48:11,620
Bugs Bunny's like one of the most famous people ever.

836
00:48:11,620 --> 00:48:12,620
Absolutely.

837
00:48:12,620 --> 00:48:15,340
You know, like just shut up about your like brother who drowned.

838
00:48:15,340 --> 00:48:16,340
Like I don't.

839
00:48:16,340 --> 00:48:17,340
It doesn't matter.

840
00:48:17,340 --> 00:48:19,820
Bugs Bunny, he literally like eats a carrot the whole world laughs.

841
00:48:19,820 --> 00:48:21,820
Do you know another comedian who has that ability?

842
00:48:21,820 --> 00:48:22,820
No.

843
00:48:22,820 --> 00:48:23,820
No, nobody.

844
00:48:23,820 --> 00:48:24,820
No, there's nobody who can do that.

845
00:48:24,820 --> 00:48:30,600
Yeah, that's like I mean it's fucking it's insane to say it work. So this next poem speaking of Bugs Bunny

846
00:48:30,600 --> 00:48:37,800
Yeah, you said it as a companion song. Yeah, that song is Harlem nocturne by the Viscounts. Okay, let me look this up. Mm-hmm

847
00:48:37,800 --> 00:48:45,820
Give me a second here. Yeah, Harlem. How are you slapping my knee? No, just a dead air, you know, yeah

848
00:48:45,820 --> 00:48:49,260
Okay, here we go. Single version. All right. Okay, here we go. I'm playing it. I

849
00:48:49,260 --> 00:48:52,380
Can't hear it

850
00:48:54,020 --> 00:48:58,180
One crazy night at the wet and wild Looney Tunes Conventional

851
00:48:58,180 --> 00:49:03,180
Things got out of hand when the cartoon characters became

852
00:49:03,180 --> 00:49:05,740
unconventional

853
00:49:05,740 --> 00:49:10,980
For instance Sheriff Ricochet Rabbit grabbed a hold of Bugs Bunny and really let him have it

854
00:49:10,980 --> 00:49:17,380
Because the sheriff knew Bugs Bunny's single-bend ear was code for he likes taking it up the rear

855
00:49:17,380 --> 00:49:20,460
now while those two

856
00:49:20,460 --> 00:49:25,760
Sick puppies of bunnies got down on their got down to their rodent man-on-man

857
00:49:25,760 --> 00:49:28,040
rodent jollies

858
00:49:28,040 --> 00:49:34,420
Daffy Duck plucked off all of his feathers because he likes to strip then strap on some S&M leathers

859
00:49:34,420 --> 00:49:41,480
Oh, you should have seen it when he cornered Elmer J. Fudd whipped him silly then smoked some really good bud

860
00:49:41,480 --> 00:49:48,980
After that Daffy became loose as taffy then sent out his sights on none other than Miss Minnie

861
00:49:49,260 --> 00:49:55,160
But Mickey Mouse wasn't having any of that. He then let Daffy have it with his baseball bat.

862
00:49:55,160 --> 00:49:58,880
And so when this drunken stone mallard finally came to,

863
00:49:58,880 --> 00:50:01,620
he sang a different ballard.

864
00:50:01,620 --> 00:50:04,360
Ballad.

865
00:50:04,360 --> 00:50:10,480
Daffy chilled out then dug this wild convention scene. That's when he realized what really happens

866
00:50:10,480 --> 00:50:12,660
behind the scenes.

867
00:50:12,660 --> 00:50:14,660
He saw Porky the Pig

868
00:50:14,660 --> 00:50:16,960
getting blown by Yosemite Sam.

869
00:50:18,160 --> 00:50:22,640
But whoever knew yo had taste for chewing that kind of ham

870
00:50:22,640 --> 00:50:29,840
Now the next sight was certainly from another level as Sylvester the cat was riding the Tasmanian devil

871
00:50:29,840 --> 00:50:34,760
He also saw something foul upon which his shocked eyes happened to gawk

872
00:50:34,760 --> 00:50:37,980
foghorn lechhorn fucking tweety bird

873
00:50:37,980 --> 00:50:46,080
Cuz old foggy's a goddamn chicken hawk what does that mean I hope that's not a slur no it's a

874
00:50:46,880 --> 00:50:49,160
Then there was a Jessica rabbit

875
00:50:49,160 --> 00:50:55,300
Turning up turning some special order tricks pulled hairs out her ass so the bitch got paid

876
00:50:55,300 --> 00:50:57,880
cleaning herself of tics

877
00:50:57,880 --> 00:51:00,720
At one point Jessica's tight little rabbit hole

878
00:51:00,720 --> 00:51:03,160
Became very loose

879
00:51:03,160 --> 00:51:06,340
Yep, you guessed it. She fucked Bullwinkle

880
00:51:06,340 --> 00:51:09,440
That hung like a horse moose

881
00:51:10,040 --> 00:51:14,040
The dirty bitch even gave Pepe Le Pew some deep-throated head.

882
00:51:14,040 --> 00:51:20,200
That's when Daffy saw her ruby earrings so bright and alluringly red. He knew he...

883
00:51:20,200 --> 00:51:23,840
That's how it's written.

884
00:51:23,840 --> 00:51:29,600
He knew he had to have them, but was shocked to see her blowing a skunk.

885
00:51:29,600 --> 00:51:34,980
Then thought to himself, if I scare Pepe, he'd spray the whole place with funk.

886
00:51:34,980 --> 00:51:39,160
So while on Jessica Rabbit, Bullwinkle, and Pepe did run a train.

887
00:51:39,680 --> 00:51:47,280
Daffy sneaked, sneakily pulled the fire alarm and the sprinklers started to rain.

888
00:51:47,280 --> 00:51:54,280
It scared the shit out of that just about to come skunk, causing him to rip loose with

889
00:51:54,280 --> 00:51:56,760
his famously foul funk.

890
00:51:56,760 --> 00:52:01,880
Jessica hurled carrot chunks all over Pepe's dick and that most certainly ended up doing

891
00:52:01,880 --> 00:52:02,880
a trick.

892
00:52:02,880 --> 00:52:07,400
Daffy then stole the ruby earrings and ran all the way to the desert saying it's mine

893
00:52:07,400 --> 00:52:08,400
mine mine.

894
00:52:08,400 --> 00:52:11,600
Got there and saw something that totally blew his mind.

895
00:52:11,600 --> 00:52:16,800
The Road Runner was finally captured by the Coyote and was being force-fed

896
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:19,200
Spoonfuls of some wacky peyote.

897
00:52:19,200 --> 00:52:20,900
Daffy couldn't believe his eyes.

898
00:52:20,900 --> 00:52:23,500
An hour later, the Road Runner was beyond stone.

899
00:52:23,500 --> 00:52:27,800
That poor fucking bird got bent way over as the Coyote finally got his bone.

900
00:52:27,800 --> 00:52:30,400
Daffy heard him say while stroking away,

901
00:52:30,400 --> 00:52:34,100
"In all this time, you thought I just wanted to cook you.

902
00:52:34,100 --> 00:52:35,900
Well, I still do, but first,

903
00:52:36,200 --> 00:52:39,340
"I'd like to super silly fuck and then eat you."

904
00:52:39,340 --> 00:52:44,620
Daffy was appalled and thought to save the Roadrunner, so he came up with a plan which is a hell of a humdinger.

905
00:52:44,620 --> 00:52:51,800
He ran over to them and then said to the Coyote in mid-stroke as he was still fucking the Roadrunner while giving his neck a little love choke.

906
00:52:51,800 --> 00:52:56,440
"I'm sorry to interrupt, but I'm here to mention you both missed out on the Looney Tunes convention."

907
00:52:56,440 --> 00:53:01,680
The Coyote stopped from choking his fucking chicken.

908
00:53:01,680 --> 00:53:04,520
Then said to Daffy, "Now you had just better listen.

909
00:53:04,520 --> 00:53:07,680
"I hope you don't say anything about what you just fucking saw, because trust me-"

910
00:53:07,680 --> 00:53:11,020
And then BAM! Without warning, Daffy broke the coyote's jaw.

911
00:53:11,020 --> 00:53:15,540
Daffy helped the Roadrunner heal, and they both grin as the coyote began to squeal.

912
00:53:15,540 --> 00:53:18,100
An hour later, the Daffy- Daffy says,

913
00:53:18,100 --> 00:53:21,360
"You know, the coyote wasn't that tough, but I did enjoy eating him."

914
00:53:21,360 --> 00:53:24,380
"Even though dog meat can be a bit rough."

915
00:53:24,380 --> 00:53:30,520
The Roadrunner falls over giggling with hysterical laughter as Daffy screams aloud,

916
00:53:30,520 --> 00:53:34,120
his cry echoing across the canyon's rafter.

917
00:53:34,320 --> 00:53:42,320
Let it be known if you come at me, bring plenty of luck, because I'm Taffy Duck and I don't give a damn fuck. End of part two.

918
00:53:42,320 --> 00:53:49,820
Imagine just somebody showing up to a poetry slam and just saying that for like 20 minutes straight.

919
00:53:49,820 --> 00:53:51,320
How fucking long was that?

920
00:53:51,320 --> 00:53:55,320
I got really, really stuck on Porky the Pig blowing Yosemite Sam.

921
00:53:55,320 --> 00:53:57,820
That is... No, I think it was the other way around.

922
00:53:57,820 --> 00:53:58,820
No, no.

923
00:53:58,820 --> 00:54:01,820
No, he said he didn't know that yo like that kind of ham.

924
00:54:01,820 --> 00:54:05,820
Oh, I assume that that meant that Yosemite was eating the hand.

925
00:54:05,820 --> 00:54:07,820
I do like that there was a song companion to that.

926
00:54:07,820 --> 00:54:10,820
Yeah, the song companion added a lot. It played two times.

927
00:54:10,820 --> 00:54:11,820
It was a long...

928
00:54:11,820 --> 00:54:13,820
The song, it helped so much.

929
00:54:13,820 --> 00:54:14,820
It did, yeah.

930
00:54:14,820 --> 00:54:16,820
It felt like you were in L.A. Noire.

931
00:54:16,820 --> 00:54:17,820
Yeah.

932
00:54:17,820 --> 00:54:18,820
I was recounting it.

933
00:54:18,820 --> 00:54:19,820
The worst story ever.

934
00:54:19,820 --> 00:54:20,820
His name is Daffy Duck.

935
00:54:20,820 --> 00:54:22,820
Maybe I should have read it like that.

936
00:54:22,820 --> 00:54:23,820
Yeah, you should have.

937
00:54:23,820 --> 00:54:24,820
Yeah, that would have been funny.

938
00:54:24,820 --> 00:54:27,820
I didn't listen to the song beforehand.

939
00:54:27,820 --> 00:54:34,220
So I have, I'm gonna do, I have two here. Sure and then I have one we can finish it off

940
00:54:34,220 --> 00:54:37,540
with. Oh let me do all three of these. Okay. All right.

941
00:54:37,540 --> 00:54:42,920
This is a really, there's two really quick ones here. Okay. A filthy dog ate a

942
00:54:42,920 --> 00:54:46,780
maggot lunch on my ball sack. Who in their right mind would allow my stink in

943
00:54:46,780 --> 00:54:57,940
public that's the end it's called the ball sack wars and then you know what

944
00:54:57,940 --> 00:55:02,260
I'll just do I'll skip that one and we'll just do this one for my last one

945
00:55:02,260 --> 00:55:08,100
this one's called so this one's called South Park okay home by two more going

946
00:55:08,100 --> 00:55:13,620
down south to listen to Cartman's big mouth see his friend Kyle be pissed all

947
00:55:13,620 --> 00:55:20,300
while Kenny doesn't have a penny but he is friendly among many Stan is a normal

948
00:55:20,300 --> 00:55:25,520
boy partially because his father was a man they also can afford much more than

949
00:55:25,520 --> 00:55:31,540
Kenny can come on down south and we'll meet some friends of mine

950
00:55:31,540 --> 00:55:37,100
it's a four years old that for you I think that's a pitch for the new theme

951
00:55:37,100 --> 00:55:41,580
song yeah it's yeah there was like a million South Park poems really so yeah

952
00:55:41,580 --> 00:55:43,820
A lot of people have a lot of stuff to say.

953
00:55:43,820 --> 00:55:44,820
So I do.

954
00:55:44,820 --> 00:55:47,620
I have a short one and a long one and then a good finisher one.

955
00:55:47,620 --> 00:55:48,940
We have like five minutes left.

956
00:55:48,940 --> 00:55:50,940
I don't know if anybody else has any more that they want to read.

957
00:55:50,940 --> 00:55:53,740
If we have five minutes left, I'll read this one.

958
00:55:53,740 --> 00:55:59,460
This one is called "My Bad Boy Earl" by Goombas Girl.

959
00:55:59,460 --> 00:56:02,620
Dedicated to Earl, R.I.P.

960
00:56:02,620 --> 00:56:04,320
His name is Earl, I have to say.

961
00:56:04,320 --> 00:56:07,740
I will fuck him hard every day.

962
00:56:07,740 --> 00:56:09,580
All tied up, his dick hangs low.

963
00:56:09,580 --> 00:56:11,700
Cock in my mouth, now he explodes.

964
00:56:11,700 --> 00:56:13,460
I spank him hard, it pains himself.

965
00:56:13,460 --> 00:56:15,480
Four fingers in, I play with myself.

966
00:56:15,480 --> 00:56:17,200
Nipple claps, ball spreaders too.

967
00:56:17,200 --> 00:56:19,560
Deep in your ass, more you plead, so I do.

968
00:56:19,560 --> 00:56:21,160
Now that you came, it's my turn now.

969
00:56:21,160 --> 00:56:23,020
Hurry, please go, oh, I wonder how.

970
00:56:23,020 --> 00:56:24,860
One finger, two finger, three fingers, four.

971
00:56:24,860 --> 00:56:26,780
My cunt is filled, but I want more.

972
00:56:26,780 --> 00:56:28,180
Pound my ass, I beg you please.

973
00:56:28,180 --> 00:56:29,380
On the floor, I'm on all knees.

974
00:56:29,380 --> 00:56:30,940
Cock jammed in, you fuck me strong.

975
00:56:30,940 --> 00:56:33,020
Go Earl, go on, you cannot go wrong.

976
00:56:33,020 --> 00:56:34,900
Deep in my hole, how I love your huge cock.

977
00:56:34,900 --> 00:56:36,540
Back and forth, I rock and rock.

978
00:56:36,540 --> 00:56:38,320
As my body shakes, I finally come.

979
00:56:38,320 --> 00:56:39,160
It's your turn again.

980
00:56:39,160 --> 00:56:42,520
you better run 12 years ago. R. I. P. Earl.

981
00:56:42,520 --> 00:56:51,280
That's the, maybe the best ending line for that poem.

982
00:56:51,280 --> 00:56:55,520
All right. So I'll, I'll finish off with these three then.

983
00:56:55,520 --> 00:57:00,840
This first one is by Andrew Kel and it's called a sound coming from Ross's

984
00:57:00,840 --> 00:57:05,640
bedroom. Is this Ross Geller? No, I don't think so.

985
00:57:05,640 --> 00:57:08,120
Unfortunately. I mean, it could be, okay. You know, actually we don't know.

986
00:57:08,120 --> 00:57:11,180
doesn't have a last name in here. So if you want to imagine this is Ross

987
00:57:11,180 --> 00:57:13,820
Geller, that's fine. Okay, let me just read this.

988
00:57:13,820 --> 00:57:19,420
Well, everyone else in the pool continued splashing to keep cool. Debbie

989
00:57:19,420 --> 00:57:24,100
went inside for a drink before she heard a sound coming from Ross's bedroom and

990
00:57:24,100 --> 00:57:29,640
start peeking on him, drill his rod in the pink taco of and who was on top of

991
00:57:29,640 --> 00:57:33,420
Sarah just before a pop came from Ross's own dude, piston dink.

992
00:57:33,420 --> 00:57:36,300
Dude, piston dink.

993
00:57:37,180 --> 00:57:38,180
Wow.

994
00:57:38,180 --> 00:57:39,180
Wow.

995
00:57:39,180 --> 00:57:40,180
Really beautiful, right?

996
00:57:40,180 --> 00:57:41,180
That was written a day ago it says?

997
00:57:41,180 --> 00:57:42,180
Holy shit.

998
00:57:42,180 --> 00:57:50,220
I'm amazed at how, honestly like, I'm amazed at how much shit like this is on this website.

999
00:57:50,220 --> 00:57:51,220
It's insane.

1000
00:57:51,220 --> 00:57:52,220
There's so much.

1001
00:57:52,220 --> 00:57:57,260
And also when you sign up, it says that if you're under the age of 17, it turns off explicit

1002
00:57:57,260 --> 00:57:58,260
things.

1003
00:57:58,260 --> 00:57:59,260
Yeah, and I put my birthday in.

1004
00:57:59,260 --> 00:58:01,540
This website hasn't been, I don't think it's been, no, the thing has been updated.

1005
00:58:01,540 --> 00:58:03,340
No, you have to go into the settings and change it.

1006
00:58:03,340 --> 00:58:10,180
I put my birthday in 1997 and then it said you were 17. What? Yeah, it said you're

1007
00:58:10,180 --> 00:58:15,020
under 17. I said I was born in 1926. Yeah, what did I, you have to make a website on,

1008
00:58:15,020 --> 00:58:18,900
an account on this website to view the poems. What user name did you

1009
00:58:18,900 --> 00:58:23,900
guys go with? Dr. Pepper 2. I think I'm, let me check. I went with Juice World.

1010
00:58:23,900 --> 00:58:35,460
world. Yeah, Juice WRLD is really good. That's my go-to. Mine is Mr. Dookie. Alright, here

1011
00:58:35,460 --> 00:58:41,820
we go. Let me read. This is our second to last one here. This is kind of long, but it's

1012
00:58:41,820 --> 00:58:49,380
called Ping Pong, a poem written by Big Verge. Okay. This is from 2020. Now when I was young,

1013
00:58:49,380 --> 00:58:53,540
athletic and strong. I really did love a good game of ping pong or that's right

1014
00:58:53,540 --> 00:58:58,060
table tennis. But I say this to preface this poetic message. Do I need a ping to

1015
00:58:58,060 --> 00:59:02,180
say I'm infectious pings that now sting like this Corona menace that now will

1016
00:59:02,180 --> 00:59:05,540
send endless pings that now pong when their message is wrong. I mean, what's

1017
00:59:05,540 --> 00:59:09,240
going on? Do all these pings belong in a world where it's said that we're now

1018
00:59:09,240 --> 00:59:13,100
seeing less of this need to inject or a need to prolong distancing measures as

1019
00:59:13,100 --> 00:59:16,700
lockdowns are lessened because of a drop in the rate of infections. And because

1020
00:59:16,700 --> 00:59:21,000
of these apps that can chart and can map infections before you know that you've caught a variant

1021
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:25,400
form of this corona force? Have the tables now turned so corona gets burned and no longer

1022
00:59:25,400 --> 00:59:29,920
fills urns or are we being served a whole load of spin about all these pings when PMs

1023
00:59:29,920 --> 00:59:34,240
refuse to start isolating because I'm confused by reports in the news where their tables now

1024
00:59:34,240 --> 00:59:37,720
show that corona has slowed because these pings know where it is people go because of

1025
00:59:37,720 --> 00:59:42,320
our phones and now know who it is we've been in contact with so can trace virus strains

1026
00:59:42,320 --> 00:59:45,960
that are in people's veins? Doesn't it seem insane that we have to track and trace all

1027
00:59:45,960 --> 00:59:48,820
all over the place, but still have to wear masks to cover our

1028
00:59:48,820 --> 00:59:50,540
face or okay.

1029
00:59:50,540 --> 00:59:51,560
Yes, our mouths.

1030
00:59:51,560 --> 00:59:54,420
Does the logic seem sound profound and thought out or something

1031
00:59:54,420 --> 00:59:57,060
thrown around just like circus clowns to keep people tied down

1032
00:59:57,060 --> 00:59:59,200
controlled and now bound like some kind of bad hound.

1033
00:59:59,200 --> 01:00:02,600
Are all these pings correct or a way to direct people to inject

1034
01:00:02,600 --> 01:00:05,580
because of the threat of a quarantine bed or being jobless

1035
01:00:05,580 --> 01:00:08,720
because of a ping that tells you to stay away from working and

1036
01:00:08,720 --> 01:00:09,400
earning a wage.

1037
01:00:09,400 --> 01:00:11,840
The table's not straight like these government names and their

1038
01:00:11,840 --> 01:00:12,480
government games.

1039
01:00:12,480 --> 01:00:15,320
Are we all being played and forced to vaccinate because of

1040
01:00:15,320 --> 01:00:19,640
these pings. Surely something must give in people's thinking when tech like this gives

1041
01:00:19,640 --> 01:00:23,920
us bad messages that claim to predict when we will become sick. It's a form of sickness

1042
01:00:23,920 --> 01:00:27,720
that clearly is linked to making us live in a world that restricts because of these pings

1043
01:00:27,720 --> 01:00:30,680
that come from our phones because it isn't a joke to be told stay at home by an app that

1044
01:00:30,680 --> 01:00:35,720
now tracks and apparently can diagnose better than these people in labs who still don't

1045
01:00:35,720 --> 01:00:39,640
seem sure of how variants form. So our saying be warned because these vaccines don't cure

1046
01:00:39,640 --> 01:00:43,400
or stop us from getting corona infected because you've had shots, they're singing dud songs

1047
01:00:43,400 --> 01:00:47,000
things unlike what's going on and do not seem able to stop telling fables. It

1048
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:49,920
feels like a game where we're being played because of false claims about the

1049
01:00:49,920 --> 01:00:53,720
flu strain. I wish I could say that things will be okay, but something seems

1050
01:00:53,720 --> 01:00:57,960
off because Corona's not gone or taking a break and going away, which brings me

1051
01:00:57,960 --> 01:01:01,080
right back to the days of my youth when things weren't so bad and filled with

1052
01:01:01,080 --> 01:01:05,480
this flu that's causing problems for us in multitudes. I just wish I could go

1053
01:01:05,480 --> 01:01:08,560
back to those days when I was in school and saw nothing wrong with hearing the

1054
01:01:08,560 --> 01:01:10,880
sounds of a game of ping pong.

1055
01:01:12,900 --> 01:01:18,420
This guy has like so many that are all about like coronavirus and all are this long.

1056
01:01:18,420 --> 01:01:18,980
It does it all.

1057
01:01:18,980 --> 01:01:19,940
Written in this style.

1058
01:01:19,940 --> 01:01:20,420
It's a fake.

1059
01:01:20,420 --> 01:01:21,700
Yeah.

1060
01:01:21,700 --> 01:01:22,820
Talking about what it's going to be.

1061
01:01:22,820 --> 01:01:24,180
It gets you. It gets you hooked in.

1062
01:01:24,180 --> 01:01:26,500
I was like, oh, it's going to be ping pong. It's going to be sick.

1063
01:01:26,500 --> 01:01:31,700
All the like paragraphs to end with like four exclamation points or a bunch of

1064
01:01:31,700 --> 01:01:33,140
exclamation points and question marks.

1065
01:01:33,140 --> 01:01:36,420
Yeah. Well, it also is the exact flow of The Way I Am by Eminem.

1066
01:01:36,420 --> 01:01:39,300
It's like literally the exact same thing.

1067
01:01:39,300 --> 01:01:39,860
Yeah.

1068
01:01:39,860 --> 01:01:42,260
All right. I got one more to close it out for this poetry.

1069
01:01:42,260 --> 01:01:46,720
So imagine like you know the lights go low everybody people it's like you know people are ready to go home

1070
01:01:46,720 --> 01:01:52,960
This is yeah, you can't get Ginsburg. Oh, yeah, this is by NJ Towers. I'm not gonna read the title yet

1071
01:01:52,960 --> 01:01:56,340
Seen it yeah

1072
01:01:56,340 --> 01:02:00,060
They found nothing in his pockets, but lint and knives

1073
01:02:00,060 --> 01:02:03,240
controlling bats and taking lives

1074
01:02:03,240 --> 01:02:05,660
He changes the tides with nine words

1075
01:02:05,660 --> 01:02:10,360
Some people just want to watch the world burn Wow

1076
01:02:11,020 --> 01:02:14,140
A killer clown with a chilling laugh?

1077
01:02:14,140 --> 01:02:16,760
The letter A is a craft.

1078
01:02:16,760 --> 01:02:18,900
You say he's insidious.

1079
01:02:18,900 --> 01:02:22,380
He asks, "Why so serious?"

1080
01:02:22,380 --> 01:02:24,520
Is there no one that sees the joke?

1081
01:02:24,520 --> 01:02:27,420
For everything to go up in smoke?

1082
01:02:27,420 --> 01:02:31,940
He's a mad dog chasing its tail.

1083
01:02:31,940 --> 01:02:35,660
His master plans will never fail.

1084
01:02:35,660 --> 01:02:39,260
That was the title, "Why So Serious?" by N.J. Towers.

1085
01:02:39,260 --> 01:02:43,260
is beautiful. Wow. Yeah. Thank you, everybody. Thank you for coming to the Poetry Slam. We'll

1086
01:02:43,260 --> 01:02:45,820
see you at the next one. Bye!
