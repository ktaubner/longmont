I'm trying to get that burp out.

We're recording?

00:00:38,420 --> 00:00:38,920
OK.

23
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:40,200
Let's go.

What's-- what's wrong?

28
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:51,280
What the fuck is wrong with you?

29
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:54,200
You went to JCPenney 10 minutes ago?

30
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:56,640
This is not--

31
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:57,520
This is ridiculous.

32
00:00:57,520 --> 00:00:58,360
I need a drink.

33
00:00:58,360 --> 00:01:05,140
All right.

34
00:01:05,140 --> 00:01:07,240
- What's this?

35
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:08,880
- Okay, let's reset, let's reset.

36
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:10,800
You need to reset.

37
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:13,340
- I got the memo a little too late.

38
00:01:13,340 --> 00:01:15,140
- I don't wanna hear it.

39
00:01:15,140 --> 00:01:18,120
You don't have nice clothes sitting in your closet.

40
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:19,800
So you already,

41
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:23,000
you already shouldn't have been here in the first place.

42
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
But we're gonna go ahead and get started.

43
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:27,400
Hello.

44
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:28,400
Hello.

45
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:29,400
Hello.

46
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:32,960
And welcome to Liquor We Enjoyed.

47
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:37,680
We're your hosts, Caleb Rex and Julio.

48
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:44,160
Tonight we'll be guiding you through a journey of tasting different kinds of notes.

49
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:45,160
We're called the Tasters.

50
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:46,840
We're the Tasters.

51
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:48,420
For tonight we're the Tasters.

52
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:49,420
If I can get- ah, hold on!

53
00:01:49,420 --> 00:01:55,040
It seems like I can begin because I have opened mine.

54
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:59,580
This is legitimately the first ever liquor bottle that I've ever purchased with my money.

55
00:01:59,580 --> 00:02:05,120
So I have purchased Gentleman Jack.

56
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:06,120
Wow.

57
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:07,120
Wow.

58
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:13,240
A double mellow Tennessee whiskey by Jack Daniels.

59
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:14,240
By Jack Daniels.

60
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:15,240
Okay.

61
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:16,240
Price check.

62
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:18,680
How much is that little ass bottle?

63
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:19,680
$22.

64
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:22,480
So that's expensive because that's what?

65
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:23,480
180 mil?

66
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:24,480
275.

67
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:27,480
Yes. Actually, this is $3.75.

68
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:30,480
What the hell? That thing looks tiny. You have big hands.

69
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:31,480
I do.

70
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:34,480
That looks amazing. So, what I want you to do is sip it.

71
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:36,480
Do a little...

72
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:38,480
Give me the notes on this one.

73
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:41,480
And you're enjoying this on the rocks.

74
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:42,480
On the rocks.

75
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:43,480
On the rocks.

76
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:44,480
Mmm.

77
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:46,480
Oh my god.

78
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:50,480
It's slightly, like, oaky. Like an oak flavor.

79
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:51,480
Okay.

80
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:52,480
Very enjoyable, though.

81
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:54,480
I actually am enjoying it.

82
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:57,480
Alright, now, normally we would do basketball, right?

83
00:02:57,480 --> 00:03:03,480
But basketball is a sport for poor people to watch, just like football and soccer.

84
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:05,480
Yeah, this has been penicillin-y.

85
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:08,480
Give me squash. Squash player.

86
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:15,480
In a squash player height, so 4'11" to 5'4"ish, somewhere in there.

87
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:21,480
How about, instead of doing that, we do jockey heights?

88
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:31,280
heights. Yeah, okay. Jockey heights. Oh yeah, that's great. Yeah. Three foot nine. Oh, 74

89
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:39,520
pound Guatemalan jockey. Wow. Okay. All right. Three of his last four races. He's doing great.

90
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:43,440
I'd love with the biggest horse ever. Oh, I've opened mine. Okay. I've poured mine. I'd

91
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:47,560
like for you to take a look at this and guess what this is just on, just based on looking

92
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:59,800
on it. Probably maybe for you and your kindergarten outfit. You do have a scotch. Close. Boba?

93
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:06,640
Rye? This is an Irish whiskey guys. And this is not just any Irish whiskey, but this is

94
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:11,960
one of the finest Irish whiskeys on the planet from one of the finest men that God has ever

95
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:19,960
graced us with. Guys, I'm talking proper 12. This is Conor McGregor's Irish whiskey.

96
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:23,560
That's awesome. This is the smallest bottle they had, guys.

97
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:29,480
This is 750 milliliters. I will never drink this. I do not like whiskey, historically.

98
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:35,120
But if there's one person that could change my mind on this disgusting drink, it might

99
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:39,360
just be one of the greatest. For the next month or so, we're going to be

100
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:42,000
playing Valorant at like 11pm.

101
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,320
- I'm gonna be like, oh wait, what do I have?

102
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:45,640
Oh, I have proper 12.

103
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:49,160
Cheers, my friends.

104
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:50,000
- Cheers.

105
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:56,440
It looks like he loves it.

106
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:57,560
What are the notes on that shit?

107
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:58,480
Smell it.

108
00:04:58,480 --> 00:04:59,480
- Okay, hold on.

109
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:08,280
Oh my God, man.

110
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:10,280
I just hate whiskey, son.

111
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:12,280
Why did you do this?

112
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:14,280
I don't know.

113
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:16,280
I don't...

114
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:18,280
I...

115
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:20,280
I mean, the thing is, I don't even know

116
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:22,280
what good whiskey is supposed to taste.

117
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:24,280
I've had really good whiskey. Noah brought back some like...

118
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:26,280
Yes.

119
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:28,280
He had like that $600 bottle of whiskey that they sold him for $60.

120
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:30,280
It tasted like gasoline.

121
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:32,280
It tasted just like this. I couldn't tell the difference at all.

122
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:34,280
It all just...

123
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:36,280
I feel like it's like a cilantro thing.

124
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:43,900
like the notes are like putting a bunch of like metal in your mouth from like

125
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:46,960
different sources you know when you when you were a kid you used to put your

126
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:51,440
mouth on the water fountain yeah it's like rebar shavings that exact kind of

127
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:58,360
taste of like well-trodden metal but you know I'm gonna give this 10 out of 10

128
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:03,200
maybe to a two-foot tall jockey this is one of the best drinks I've ever had.

129
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:03,760
what's up?

130
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:09,560
I think I may have had the same sort of idea or like conception about this this

131
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:14,440
whole episode as Caleb. Well clearly fucking not. Regarding the drinks.

132
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:21,680
Again you are you look like you served Mai Tais on Jeffrey Epstein. You look like an

133
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:30,280
extra in the White Lotus. People are saying I look great. No. Anyways. You look like you aged in a bit.

134
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:31,120
- Yesterday.

135
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:33,360
- You look like you worked at Trader Joe's.

136
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:34,200
- Yesterday.

137
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:35,020
- Yes!

138
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:37,560
- People in the chat might remember this.

139
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:38,980
I was looking at some YouTube videos.

140
00:06:38,980 --> 00:06:43,280
I was like, hmm, I think because of who I am,

141
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:46,180
I should just get some tequila, right?

142
00:06:46,180 --> 00:06:49,440
And also, what do you know,

143
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:51,600
there's tequila with my name on it

144
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:54,120
that I was watching a review of it.

145
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:57,440
But the guy just kept smelling it and saying made up stuff.

146
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:59,800
I felt like I was in that John Wilson episode.

147
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:03,800
So I just went ahead and I just got some mezcal.

148
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:08,400
This is mezcal from Oaxaca.

149
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:12,400
It is called 400 bunnies or 400 conejos.

150
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:15,880
It's joven, so it means it's young.

151
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:17,560
And I've got a 100% galvanic.

152
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:23,800
And this here feels good man cup that my girlfriend brought back from Mexico City.

153
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:27,800
Okay, give us a little sip and give us a little talk.

154
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:30,800
Um...

155
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:32,500
He likes it.

156
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:33,500
It's gonna taste like nothing.

157
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:35,300
Oh!

158
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:38,300
It's probably because it's been sitting in the ice water for...

159
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:41,300
Yeah, I can tell, those are tiny ice cubes. It's definitely melted a lot.

160
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:44,800
It's a hot day today. Hence my outfit.

161
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:46,300
I'm at the beach.

162
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:47,300
No, you're not.

163
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:50,800
That's not what you do at the beach. You don't go, "Whoa!"

164
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:51,800
Whoa, there's flyers up there!

165
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:53,300
You don't look up. The beach is on the ground.

166
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:55,300
There's a peach over there! I can see it!

167
00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:55,800
Give me a kite!

168
00:07:55,800 --> 00:08:00,300
The flyers. Anyways, uh, this is a short guy. This is a, uh, a...

169
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:03,300
One centimeter tall guy.

170
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:05,300
He's the best jockey in the world.

171
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:06,300
He's just drinking water.

172
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:07,300
That's just a horse.

173
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:09,300
That's not water, dude. I opened this shit.

174
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:11,300
Look, you can see that I...

175
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:14,300
Is that why jockeys need to be small?

176
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:18,300
Is because the more... the smaller they are, the more... the closer it is to just a horse?

177
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:21,300
'Cause the jockey's not doing anything but weighing the horse down.

178
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:23,300
the

179
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:25,300
What's a jockey speaking English to him?

180
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:27,300
What do you mean direct it? Go forward.

181
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:29,300
They have horse races all the time.

182
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:31,300
They have dog races. Put a... what are horses like?

183
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:33,300
Carrots? Put a moving carrot.

184
00:08:33,300 --> 00:08:35,300
They gotta make him turn.

185
00:08:35,300 --> 00:08:37,300
Dogs can get into a scrap.

186
00:08:37,300 --> 00:08:39,300
They can bump into each other.

187
00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:41,300
They're like NASCAR cars.

188
00:08:41,300 --> 00:08:43,300
Horses...

189
00:08:43,300 --> 00:08:45,300
Like an F1 car.

190
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:47,300
They like touch wheels and immediately just explode

191
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:49,300
and murder the whole crowd.

192
00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:51,300
That's a good point.

193
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:54,500
race crash compilation on YouTube?

194
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:56,500
You've just opened my mind to a brand new thing.

195
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:57,500
There's gotta be.

196
00:08:57,500 --> 00:09:00,100
There's gotta be a Dale Earnhardt Jr. of horses.

197
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:01,100
Yeah.

198
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:03,940
Just to fucking go with it.

199
00:09:03,940 --> 00:09:07,100
I feel like they did that in the Simpsons at some point.

200
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:08,420
Where a horse exploded.

201
00:09:08,420 --> 00:09:13,060
I think if your horse gets hurt and you're a jockey, they should put you down with the

202
00:09:13,060 --> 00:09:14,060
horse.

203
00:09:14,060 --> 00:09:15,060
I agree.

204
00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:16,780
What else are you gonna do?

205
00:09:16,780 --> 00:09:17,780
Become an actor?

206
00:09:17,780 --> 00:09:20,380
You're too short to do anything.

207
00:09:20,380 --> 00:09:21,380
- You're too short.

208
00:09:21,380 --> 00:09:22,220
Tom Cruise, we already got it.

209
00:09:22,220 --> 00:09:25,940
- I think the horses are really akin to Cars in this aspect.

210
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:28,620
Like the horses get replaced every single day.

211
00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:31,300
- Well, I know, but I'm saying like, you know,

212
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:33,660
I think maybe like a couple horses.

213
00:09:33,660 --> 00:09:35,620
If you're banging up too many horses,

214
00:09:35,620 --> 00:09:36,660
you don't get to retire.

215
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:38,500
They just also take you out back.

216
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:40,780
- Do you remember the NFT horse race?

217
00:09:40,780 --> 00:09:41,620
- Yeah, yes.

218
00:09:41,620 --> 00:09:42,900
- That's so dope.

219
00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:43,980
- Are they still doing that?

220
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:45,140
- Yeah.

221
00:09:45,140 --> 00:09:47,580
- We might have a thing that we can do on our phones

222
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:48,980
at the restaurant tonight.

223
00:09:48,980 --> 00:09:50,740
That would be fun.

224
00:09:50,740 --> 00:09:51,580
Yeah.

225
00:09:51,580 --> 00:09:53,660
For those of you who don't know-- wait, go ahead.

226
00:09:53,660 --> 00:09:56,820
I'm just going to go ahead and say this.

227
00:09:56,820 --> 00:10:00,260
I'm pretty much like the same as a chat person right now.

228
00:10:00,260 --> 00:10:03,900
These-- this group of friends, meaning

229
00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:08,140
Kale, Brex, Noah, Brian, you know, the Peefers,

230
00:10:08,140 --> 00:10:10,420
for the entire yesterday, they've

231
00:10:10,420 --> 00:10:12,940
been talking and talking about this legendary night.

232
00:10:12,940 --> 00:10:14,260
They've been building it up.

233
00:10:14,260 --> 00:10:16,660
Oh my god, we're going to go downtown.

234
00:10:16,660 --> 00:10:17,220
So excited.

235
00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:18,740
We're going to start with some drinks.

236
00:10:18,740 --> 00:10:20,340
We're gonna do some gambling.

237
00:10:20,340 --> 00:10:23,660
We're gonna hit up the nicest place we can find out.

238
00:10:23,660 --> 00:10:24,940
Noah doesn't want Brian to eat.

239
00:10:24,940 --> 00:10:26,060
I don't know what that's all about.

240
00:10:26,060 --> 00:10:27,380
I didn't really listen to the whole thing.

241
00:10:27,380 --> 00:10:29,540
- Well, 'cause he doesn't, you gotta save.

242
00:10:29,540 --> 00:10:30,540
It's all you can eat.

243
00:10:30,540 --> 00:10:32,260
- I'm just a third, I'm just an observer.

244
00:10:32,260 --> 00:10:33,660
I'm just a chatter.

245
00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:35,900
I'm just seeing this happening on my screen.

246
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:37,980
I was like, I don't know, what's gonna happen, guys?

247
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:38,820
Can I see it?

248
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:40,100
Can someone record the entire night

249
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:42,620
and show it to me on stream?

250
00:10:42,620 --> 00:10:43,820
But I just don't know.

251
00:10:43,820 --> 00:10:44,660
And that's what the address is.

252
00:10:44,660 --> 00:10:46,560
- No cameras, please.

253
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:49,560
What is this legendary night that you're about to embark on?

254
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:53,060
Guys, well, it's two, possibly three pronged.

255
00:10:53,060 --> 00:10:59,060
Number one, as soon as this is over, I'm going to get my fruity ass over to this Absinthe

256
00:10:59,060 --> 00:11:00,060
bar.

257
00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:03,320
And I've had Absinthe one time and I spit it out.

258
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:06,960
But two is the magic number when you're trying foo.

259
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:11,260
So what I will do is take a big sip.

260
00:11:11,260 --> 00:11:13,640
No matter, it doesn't matter what it tastes like, I'm going to take a big sip and I'm

261
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:15,540
going to have an open mind.

262
00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:21,560
And then once we have two or three or four or five absinthe drinks in us, we are going

263
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:28,240
to an all-you-can-eat Korean barbecue place that is of the highest order, some might say.

264
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:32,740
A fancy Korean barbecue place with Wagyu beef, man.

265
00:11:32,740 --> 00:11:34,800
You probably don't even know what Wagyu beef is.

266
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:35,800
Let me tell you what it is.

267
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:36,800
Specifically A5 Wagyu beef.

268
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:38,440
A5 Wagyu beef.

269
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:41,200
This is seriously meat.

270
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:45,160
And this is meat on a level you've never seen before.

271
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:48,280
It is the fattiest cut of meat in the entire world.

272
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:49,280
It is the butter.

273
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:52,520
And to me that's the best part of a steak, the fat parts.

274
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:55,080
I always just take off the fat and just eat that.

275
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:56,720
I don't even want all the meat stuff.

276
00:11:56,720 --> 00:12:00,200
So this is perfect for me.

277
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:03,960
It is going to be like if we ate 10 pounds of butter.

278
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:04,960
And I'm really looking forward to it.

279
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:06,640
It is going to be amazing.

280
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:08,880
And then there's a 90 minute time limit.

281
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:14,760
So the whole point is we've been stretching our stomachs all day with water like Matt

282
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:32,960
that's

283
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:37,840
minutes they will be packing their bags back to Korea so fucking fast because

284
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:43,840
this place is going down. Are you guys going in like at like fucking almost 11

285
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:49,560
p.m. it is a 1030 reservation 1030 reservation because guess what this place

286
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:56,360
is so exclusive and also we canceled our last reservation so this was the only

287
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:59,720
one we could get because it's so fucking exclusive there's so many fucking

288
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:13,400
in

289
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:19,400
It's cold because of the ice in my glass, but it fills me with fire and warmth.

290
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:21,400
It's smoky as well.

291
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:22,400
It is smoky.

292
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:24,400
It's very smoky.

293
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:30,400
Let me describe the two hours that I had before we started podcasting.

294
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:31,400
Go ahead.

295
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:32,400
In preparation.

296
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:39,400
So, fans of the podcast will know that I have been sick for the last week.

297
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:40,400
Yeah.

298
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:49,040
What they don't know is that on Monday night, I got food poisoning from a Costco steak strip.

299
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:53,600
That proceeded to completely destroy me.

300
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:56,880
And made me sick yet again.

301
00:13:56,880 --> 00:14:01,440
So I still have the same cough I've had since the last time we recorded.

302
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:03,600
So you got steak in your lung?

303
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:07,280
I did. I did. I was really going through it.

304
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:14,920
As my roommate told me upon hearing me throw up, I sounded like Bugs Bunny throwing up.

305
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:17,120
So here's what I'm hearing from you.

306
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:21,880
There's nothing in the world that you want more to eat tonight than about eight pounds

307
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:22,880
of steak.

308
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:23,880
Yes.

309
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:24,880
So anyway.

310
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:25,880
Steak is only bringing good memories to you.

311
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:28,200
It is just going to be awesome.

312
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:37,640
So I went to Rite Aid down the street and I bought some 12 hour extended release mucus

313
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:43,760
relief DM Max that has 60 milligrams of dextromethaphan in it.

314
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:49,260
So enough to get you a small buzz going in the first place.

315
00:14:49,260 --> 00:14:57,960
And then I walked back and I bought a Popeye's chicken sandwich and I ate that as I was walking.

316
00:14:57,960 --> 00:15:02,120
And then after crushing that chicken sandwich on my walk back to my apartment,

317
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:08,520
a kind man named Aki approached me and he said, "Hey boss, do you smoke weed?"

318
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:10,040
Whoa.

319
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:12,040
"I sell the best weed in Brooklyn."

320
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:12,540
Whoa.

321
00:15:12,540 --> 00:15:14,680
"And wouldn't you believe it?"

322
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:17,640
I don't know if it is, but it smelled nice.

323
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:22,360
And he made me put his number in his phone so he could give me free weed in the future.

324
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:23,400
And his name was Aki.

325
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:25,560
And he's like, "My name is Aki."

326
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:26,680
And I believe him too.

327
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:28,680
and I

328
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:30,680
he was sitting on the, he was sitting on the porch

329
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:32,680
you just saw me walking

330
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:34,680
see but they, let me, I'm gonna wager a guess that you were not

331
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:36,680
wearing the same clothes that you're wearing right now

332
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:38,680
my friend. That is true, I was wearing

333
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:40,680
my shirt that says incel and block letters

334
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:42,680
yep

335
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:44,680
I can't believe you own that

336
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:46,680
that is crazy man

337
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:48,680
that, go from the incel

338
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:50,680
shirt and now you look like a

339
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:52,680
a

340
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:54,680
oh god

341
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:57,240
Can you tell the story? I don't know if you tell this in the podcast.

342
00:15:57,240 --> 00:16:01,720
Can you tell the story when you were just stuck in your room because you were wearing that shirt and there were women in the apartment?

343
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:03,960
And you were so ashamed to leave the room.

344
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:06,760
I was not ashamed, I just thought it was funny.

345
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:08,440
I have shame shirts.

346
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:09,720
Yeah, it was funny.

347
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:11,960
Yeah, I have some shirts I don't really wear.

348
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:13,720
I don't.

349
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:15,960
You do. I'm looking at one actually.

350
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:17,720
Yeah, I'm not ashamed of this shirt.

351
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:19,960
You really should be. You really should be, man.

352
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:21,560
Boom! Where should I go?

353
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:23,320
From both sides. Bang bang!

354
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:28,280
Rex is dressed like the principal of a Japanese middle school and he looks so much better

355
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:29,280
than you right now.

356
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:30,280
I do.

357
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:31,420
He looks like the orchestra.

358
00:16:31,420 --> 00:16:36,040
I do look like a villain from Persona.

359
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:37,040
You really do.

360
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:40,960
I'm bullying children and they have to change my opinion on that.

361
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:42,740
Yeah, yeah.

362
00:16:42,740 --> 00:16:43,740
Change the opinion.

363
00:16:43,740 --> 00:16:45,120
That'll save the world.

364
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:47,480
These Persona kids are so foolish, man.

365
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:48,480
Don't even get me started on Persona.

366
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:51,400
I don't even want to go there, man.

367
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:53,400
I'm trying not to talk about Persona Challenge.

368
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:55,400
Yes, I'm doing it right now.

369
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:57,400
I will never talk about it again.

370
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:59,400
No, I'm not talking about it.

371
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:01,400
So I'll talk about it.

372
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:03,400
I just wanted to say, I went to the liquor store by me.

373
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:05,400
Thank you for banning me.

374
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:07,400
Oh my god.

375
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:09,400
I had no idea.

376
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:11,400
I had no idea I was going to do that shit.

377
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:13,400
Anyway.

378
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:15,400
The liquor store by me does samples.

379
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:17,400
So I went in and I said, "Hey,

380
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:19,400
I mean,

381
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:21,400
I got a thing with some friends.

382
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:23,900
I need a liquor I can sip on.

383
00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:28,320
Maybe a mezcal, maybe a tequila, maybe a whiskey.

384
00:17:28,320 --> 00:17:29,520
What do you got?

385
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:32,120
And they said, what are you talking about?

386
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:32,960
And I said--

387
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:34,480
- He said, what are you talking about?

388
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:37,160
- They're like, sip on.

389
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:40,200
And I was like, you know, like, I need to,

390
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:43,680
I need it to be like a high quality, small bottle.

391
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:45,140
You know, I'm not mixing it with anything.

392
00:17:45,140 --> 00:17:46,760
I need it to be like good.

393
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:48,400
And they were like, okay, I kind of understand.

394
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:50,940
So I was like, "How about a mezcal?"

395
00:17:50,940 --> 00:17:51,780
And they're like, "Okay."

396
00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:54,240
So this is like our cheapest mezcal.

397
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:57,820
And they poured me like a little half shot.

398
00:17:57,820 --> 00:17:59,200
And they're like, "Here you go."

399
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:00,520
And I was like, "Okay."

400
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:02,440
- And surely you spit this out.

401
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:03,280
- Surely.

402
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:04,100
- Like a sommelier.

403
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:06,800
- I took a little sip and I was like, "Oh, that's good."

404
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:08,800
And then I knocked back the whole thing.

405
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:11,960
And then I was like, "So what about your tequila?

406
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:15,800
What about this, you know, like maybe like a Espolon White?"

407
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:17,080
You know?

408
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:19,160
Espolon Blanco as they call it.

409
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:21,400
Yes, they call it Blanco.

410
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:25,800
And so I took a little sip of that and then I knocked it back.

411
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:30,000
And then I said, "What about like a rye or like a scotch whiskey?"

412
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,480
You know, and they're like, "Okay, yeah, we've got some of that."

413
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:35,920
Took a little sip, knocked it back.

414
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:37,920
I was like, "Well, what do you recommend?"

415
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:40,920
Okay, the other choice.

416
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:44,680
- First choice, now that I've had four that I like

417
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:49,000
at the free bar, what would you give me for free?

418
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:54,000
- Yeah, so they gave me a vodka shot, a potato vodka,

419
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,080
which was honestly not that bad,

420
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:56,920
but I would definitely-- - That would have been

421
00:18:56,920 --> 00:18:59,920
a crazy one to pull out and sip by itself, though.

422
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:03,520
- So I ended up just buying this,

423
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:07,880
which was of the small bottles, the second most expensive.

424
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:09,240
- Damn.

425
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:11,840
They just have like sampling bottles for everything?

426
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:15,200
- For the most part, yeah.

427
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:16,360
- That's crazy, man.

428
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:18,400
But you got twisted at the liquor store.

429
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:19,700
- Just a little bit.

430
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:20,640
- They should let you do that shit

431
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:22,440
with cigarettes at the gas station.

432
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:23,760
- Right?

433
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:26,000
- They should give you a tiny little cigarette.

434
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:26,840
- I've been to the bake stores where they have the pistas.

435
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:29,520
- I'd like to try the Marlboro Red 100.

436
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:30,400
- Really? - With a pista?

437
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:31,240
- Yes.

438
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:32,080
- Do they clean it?

439
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:33,880
- That's why you're like, that's why you got like this.

440
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:37,480
- So when I was at, when I was in Arizona,

441
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:40,800
On Christmas day, I went to buy a vape.

442
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:44,320
Christmas day, I was like, I need a vape.

443
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:46,440
- Yeah, I've been-- - And I went to

444
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:49,120
the only place that was open nearby,

445
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:52,560
which was like four miles away from my parents' place.

446
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:57,560
And I walked in and the guy had like a rack

447
00:19:57,560 --> 00:19:59,920
of all the different vapes.

448
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:02,200
And then he had these little like tips,

449
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:05,820
like rubber tips that were like individually packaged.

450
00:20:05,820 --> 00:20:08,220
and you just put that on top of it and just,

451
00:20:08,220 --> 00:20:12,740
oh, just sommelier it.

452
00:20:12,740 --> 00:20:14,900
And I did, I hit them all.

453
00:20:14,900 --> 00:20:17,460
- That's crazy.

454
00:20:17,460 --> 00:20:18,900
- Yeah.

455
00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:20,980
- I've been watching sommelier videos,

456
00:20:20,980 --> 00:20:23,180
and guys, I think I might be a super taster.

457
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:25,300
- I think you can just-- - Yeah, what do you taste?

458
00:20:25,300 --> 00:20:26,500
- I think anyone can just be that.

459
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:27,340
I think you can just make shit up.

460
00:20:27,340 --> 00:20:29,300
- Right now, my tongue and my teeth.

461
00:20:29,300 --> 00:20:31,460
- Yeah, how do they taste?

462
00:20:31,460 --> 00:20:35,740
- They taste like brushed teeth.

463
00:20:35,740 --> 00:20:36,740
Yep.

464
00:20:36,740 --> 00:20:37,740
Yeah.

465
00:20:37,740 --> 00:20:38,740
Looks good.

466
00:20:38,740 --> 00:20:39,740
Like toothpaste.

467
00:20:39,740 --> 00:20:40,740
Like normal toothpaste and flossing.

468
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:41,740
Right.

469
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:42,740
Good kind of shit.

470
00:20:42,740 --> 00:20:43,740
Yeah.

471
00:20:43,740 --> 00:20:44,740
But not like...

472
00:20:44,740 --> 00:20:47,740
I didn't just find a piece of chicken in my mouth.

473
00:20:47,740 --> 00:20:50,300
Okay, here's a question I have for you guys.

474
00:20:50,300 --> 00:20:56,780
So if you leave chicken on the counter after you made it, it's like bad news after like

475
00:20:56,780 --> 00:20:58,340
an hour or less.

476
00:20:58,340 --> 00:20:59,700
Like 40 minutes or something.

477
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:01,980
They're like, "Don't eat this chicken."

478
00:21:01,980 --> 00:21:08,380
But if you find a piece of chicken in your teeth that's been there all day long, can

479
00:21:08,380 --> 00:21:11,180
you swallow it or am I supposed to spit that shit out?

480
00:21:11,180 --> 00:21:13,260
All day?

481
00:21:13,260 --> 00:21:17,500
Like all day type beat with this chicken in my mouth.

482
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:19,740
I think you can just eat it.

483
00:21:19,740 --> 00:21:21,500
It's already there.

484
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:22,500
That's what I'm saying.

485
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:23,500
It's already there.

486
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:29,500
But according to foods, oh food safety, you need to be food safe, certified.

487
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:31,340
You're not supposed to eat old chicken.

488
00:21:31,340 --> 00:21:33,340
Well you're not gonna serve it.

489
00:21:33,340 --> 00:21:40,980
This is like 8 year old, or 8 day, not 8 day, 8 hour old chicken sitting in my mouth.

490
00:21:40,980 --> 00:21:42,940
Sorry the proper 12 is affecting me.

491
00:21:42,940 --> 00:21:43,940
Yeah.

492
00:21:43,940 --> 00:21:49,700
I believe because it's coated in saliva that the bacteria is not gonna grow on it in the

493
00:21:49,700 --> 00:21:50,700
same way.

494
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:54,380
So I should just be spitting on all the fucking chicken I make and leaving it out?

495
00:21:54,380 --> 00:21:55,380
Yeah.

496
00:21:55,380 --> 00:21:57,060
Alright I'll do that then.

497
00:21:57,060 --> 00:21:58,060
Next question.

498
00:21:58,060 --> 00:22:05,560
Also, also, your mouth is not room temperature.

499
00:22:05,560 --> 00:22:07,640
It's warmer than room temperature, my friend.

500
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:09,360
Yeah, it's oven temperature.

501
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:13,200
I don't think it's quite oven temperature.

502
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:15,480
This bottle is really so striking visually.

503
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:18,040
I do like it a lot.

504
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:19,520
That's why you got it, huh?

505
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:22,440
No, I got it because my girlfriend told me to get this.

506
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:24,160
Because I just didn't know.

507
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:25,360
How much did that run you?

508
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:28,560
By the way, the proper 12, 750 mil, 30 bucks.

509
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:31,720
$2 cheaper than Jameson.

510
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:32,560
I almost went with the Jameson,

511
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:34,840
and then I was like, I've had Jameson before, man.

512
00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:36,640
And I don't like that shit.

513
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:38,720
There was one time when my brother was trying to get me

514
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:41,240
to take a shot of Jameson one night,

515
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:44,320
and he was all drunk and he handed me the fucking,

516
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:46,320
the Solo cup, and was like, come on, take a shot.

517
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:47,520
And I was like, okay, man.

518
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:49,680
And I actually stood next to the sink

519
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:53,640
and threw it behind my head, into the sink.

520
00:22:54,720 --> 00:23:01,720
and

521
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:09,080
the other

522
00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:10,960
uh...

523
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:13,280
is this all as well

524
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:17,240
and

525
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:18,720
the satellite drinking

526
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:20,720
as much as

527
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:23,720
yet

528
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:29,240
I do not like when people have too many drinks and start going wild.

529
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:35,080
I don't like, unless they're girls, I do not like guys going wild off of alcohol guys.

530
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:36,240
Well, in what sense?

531
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:37,680
Like violent wild?

532
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:42,480
No, like, "Oh, let's watch a movie!"

533
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:44,720
Shut up, man, you're fucking drunk.

534
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:45,720
Okay.

535
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:49,160
Or, no, that's a bad example.

536
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:53,960
Like, yeah, I can't even really think of a good example right now.

537
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:56,200
Oh, we should gamble!

538
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:57,600
We should lose like $500!

539
00:23:57,600 --> 00:24:00,200
That kind of stuff I actually do like.

540
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:03,480
I guess I do like it when people drink a lot.

541
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:04,480
Yeah.

542
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:05,480
The more I think about it.

543
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:07,560
I guess it makes people kind of a little more fun.

544
00:24:07,560 --> 00:24:11,880
Yeah, I mean, I don't, I'm not a particular fan of being around someone who's like...

545
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:14,440
I think it makes people scary.

546
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:15,440
Over that line.

547
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:16,840
I don't like society when they're drunk.

548
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:19,840
unless i'm also over that line

549
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:22,680
see i don't like going over that line when i go to the i don't like going over

550
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:25,800
this is why i go to the bathroom if you've ever drank with me you know that

551
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:29,520
i would i go to the bathroom poly forty times every time we go to the bar

552
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:30,880
and the reason is

553
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:32,860
yes i have to be

554
00:24:32,860 --> 00:24:37,500
mostly i go in there and i assess my situation

555
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:40,200
you can't do that outside the bathroom

556
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:45,800
no because i have a sitting down and i'm it uh... experiencing jovial joy with my

557
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:50,100
comrades there's there's no telling what kind of where my feelings are actually

558
00:24:50,100 --> 00:24:55,300
coming from if I go to the bathroom I smell piss and shit and it makes me

559
00:24:55,300 --> 00:24:58,980
think about my death a little bit and I go is this really how I want to be

560
00:24:58,980 --> 00:25:03,940
spending my time yeah sitting here smelling piss and shit my fucking face

561
00:25:03,940 --> 00:25:08,580
four inches out of the urinal well again you don't have to be in and then I just

562
00:25:08,580 --> 00:25:12,320
go home what are you talking about why would I what how would I ever come to

563
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:33,320
this

564
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:38,440
history of the last like four years you would be able to actually put on a like

565
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:44,240
it's a completely it's like a perfect timeline of me getting dumber and dumber

566
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:50,480
each year like the average video is worse and worse each year I mean this is

567
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:55,080
just the thing that naturally happens to people where it's like you transform from

568
00:25:55,080 --> 00:26:01,240
being like a curious young adult into like a stupid guy that's at work you

569
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:04,600
You know, like the dumb guy that you worked with when you were younger.

570
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:10,800
Yeah, I feel like when I was younger I used to walk around and be like, "Oh man, I'm so

571
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:11,800
smart.

572
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:13,440
I'm probably smarter than anybody."

573
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:17,520
And now I walk around and there's homeless guys that I'm 100% sure are smarter than me.

574
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:19,120
Like 100% sure.

575
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:23,240
Because they're like, they know how to open up a beer with a lighter.

576
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:24,800
And I'm like, "I don't know how to fucking do that."

577
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:25,800
I don't think that's...

578
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:27,200
I don't even understand the physics of that.

579
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:30,040
And then I look at my phone.

580
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:31,320
They don't have a phone to look at.

581
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:33,400
These are the most free guys in the universe.

582
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:35,360
Well, you got that phone with your phone, miss.

583
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:40,000
Do you think phones are making us dumb?

584
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,440
I think my phone is making me dumb.

585
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:44,520
I don't think it's the phone's fault.

586
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:50,560
I think that I have very little impulse control and probably wasn't that smart to begin with.

587
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:56,400
They call them smart phones, but they don't make you very smart.

588
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:57,400
Oh, okay.

589
00:26:57,400 --> 00:26:58,400
Yeah.

590
00:26:58,400 --> 00:26:59,240
- Yeah, no, that's true.

591
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:00,080
- That's the direction I went with them.

592
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:02,080
- Yeah, they should call them dumb phones then.

593
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:02,920
- They should call them dumb phones.

594
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:04,600
- They should make, making,

595
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:05,920
making kids misbehave phones. - He should call them

596
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:07,000
dumb phones.

597
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,160
- Yeah. - Misbehave phones.

598
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:10,640
- They should call them dumb phones.

599
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:12,480
- I thought the other day, I thought about,

600
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:15,040
I thought about saving up to buy an iPad.

601
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:16,520
I have no use for an iPad.

602
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:18,880
I just want a bigger phone that I can use in my house.

603
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:20,660
Like, and I can feel good, like,

604
00:27:20,660 --> 00:27:23,240
I left my phone in the kitchen

605
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:25,840
and now I'm gonna sit on my iPad until four in the morning.

606
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:27,840
Do you remember the Microsoft table?

607
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:29,840
Do you remember?

608
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:31,840
No. Is it like one of those Pac-Man tables

609
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:33,840
that they have at pizza restaurants?

610
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:35,840
Kind of. It was like when the iPad first

611
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:37,840
came out, or it was like tablets

612
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:39,840
or the future, and then they

613
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:41,840
Microsoft had like a demo

614
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:43,840
for like a thing that was like

615
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:45,840
a Pac-Man sized thing

616
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:47,840
that was just an all like

617
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:49,840
you know, touch screen

618
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:51,840
thing. And it was like, "Oh my god!"

619
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:53,840
"Oh my god!

620
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:56,440
a table that's a touch screen.

621
00:27:56,440 --> 00:27:58,440
- Were people saying this like it was a bad thing

622
00:27:58,440 --> 00:27:59,480
or a good thing?

623
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:00,560
- Like a good thing.

624
00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:02,080
- Oh yeah.

625
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:03,440
- Yeah, 'cause people just thought they were gonna

626
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:06,480
keep making bigger and bigger touch screens.

627
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:09,280
- I always got sad that they never did anything

628
00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:11,520
with Google Glass, man.

629
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:12,360
- Well, it's coming back.

630
00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:14,240
- They did a video where a guy just

631
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:16,360
punches his wife. - Google Glass.

632
00:28:16,360 --> 00:28:17,200
- What?

633
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:18,020
- Yeah.

634
00:28:18,020 --> 00:28:18,860
Just a number one Google ads video.

635
00:28:18,860 --> 00:28:20,320
- And it like calls the police?

636
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:27,480
No, she's like walking around your life like looking stuff up and then she gets punched in the face.

637
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:30,640
That's like a Google Glass ad.

638
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:33,160
I think that...

639
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:35,320
That's an ad, yeah, for Google Glass.

640
00:28:35,320 --> 00:28:38,280
That's an ad for Google Glass.

641
00:28:38,280 --> 00:28:41,840
An ad could be on YouTube.

642
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:44,080
I saw an ad for Mr. Beast the other day.

643
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:45,880
He blew up a car.

644
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:49,680
He almost killed a guy yesterday.

645
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:52,120
You told me this and I didn't watch that video.

646
00:28:52,120 --> 00:28:54,360
And I watch most MrBeast videos that come out.

647
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:56,120
And that's another, that started this year.

648
00:28:56,120 --> 00:28:59,160
So that's another kind of downtrend for me.

649
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:00,520
- Yeah.

650
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:01,680
What?

651
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:05,000
- Like I'm getting stupider to the point where in 2023,

652
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:05,840
I'm at the point where I--

653
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:07,660
- You think that MrBeast is so smart?

654
00:29:07,660 --> 00:29:08,500
- No, no, no.

655
00:29:08,500 --> 00:29:09,320
That's what I mean.

656
00:29:09,320 --> 00:29:10,920
It's obviously for dumb people.

657
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:11,760
And I watch every video.

658
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:13,200
- You think that MrBeast is the best guy

659
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:14,640
and become the dumbest guy.

660
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:15,480
- That's not true.

661
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:16,840
- On the podcast.

662
00:29:16,840 --> 00:29:17,680
- That's not true.

663
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:18,520
Stop looking at me.

664
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:19,360
- You're smart.

665
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:26,280
They start locally, but you're stupid. Why do I feel so drunk right now? I've had I've had two sips of this basically

666
00:29:26,280 --> 00:29:28,720
But let's go for another let's go

667
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:31,120
Let's go hog wild

668
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:33,120
How I don't I?

669
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:35,160
Don't think I could drink

670
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:38,800
This whole thing in my entire life. This is so big

671
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:47,480
That is a lot of mess. I will say man make yourself do yourself a favor and make yourself a mezcal Rita

672
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:49,960
What's a mezcal rita?

673
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:58,960
It's basically like taco-belling mezcal, where you put a bunch of sugar in it, and a bunch of lime juice, and a bit of triple sec.

674
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:07,960
Which, by the way, I was talking to Eric today about, I think I have the most alcoholic-style liquor cabinet in the entire universe.

675
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:14,400
Where my my where I keep my liquor I keep it above my fridge and the only two things that are ever

676
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:21,640
on top of my fridge is a giant handle of triple sec and a giant thing of Campari

677
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:28,440
Because and no gin and no tequila right because I already used up all that stuff. I

678
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:31,640
Have never had all four

679
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:38,320
It's always a bottle of tequila for like three days and then it's gone because and then there's still a lot of triple sec left

680
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:41,800
That's a bad indicator

681
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:47,680
I've lived in this apartment for like almost a year now coming close to a year and it's like the first

682
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:50,400
Actual like I go home that we've had in the house

683
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:56,520
We only usually have like beers and we only really buy beers when I people are coming over or what I'm doing the podcast

684
00:30:56,960 --> 00:31:04,240
We feel like a big-ass grown-up, um, I guess I just don't know we're gonna store this now because we don't have a place to store

685
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:06,240
It store in your mouth

686
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:10,160
Just drink the whole thing tonight man. I'm not gonna drink the whole thing

687
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:14,800
I don't I don't think I'm gonna drink another glass of this feels it feels good man. Let's go anymore

688
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:20,480
I'm gonna live or but I am gonna get a chaser something to chase with

689
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:23,720
You're gonna take a shot. Well, I'm not gonna take a shot

690
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:26,800
something else

691
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:34,800
No we can't do sh- dude we have such a long night planned man. I know I'm not gonna do a shot that's ridiculous. I've done like four shots already.

692
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:43,800
Wait do one though just right now. No. Alright hold on. Shots are disgusting man. I used to think I like taking them and I just don't.

693
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:51,800
Have you ever taken a shot of anything? Yeah. I just wouldn't think that you would do that.

694
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:59,800
So when I went to tequila, we tasted some tequila, but we drank it like you would drink wine.

695
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:06,800
We did the whole thing that, like the sommelier does, like you smell it and you're like, "Oh, that smells like fucking liquid."

696
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:12,800
But I think the only times I ever take shots is when I'm with you guys.

697
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:17,800
Same as the drinking every night type beat that I always do when I'm in New York.

698
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:24,640
I drink beers every night and sometimes we go to the gaming bar and either Noah or Caleb

699
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:27,640
or Brian go like "Yo, shots!"

700
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:31,760
Yeah, we are awesome.

701
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:35,500
I love that everyone in New York always drinks all the time.

702
00:32:35,500 --> 00:32:37,760
New York is a giant drinking city.

703
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:39,400
You're muted, man.

704
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:44,960
I did not drink much before I moved here and I drink all the time.

705
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:47,360
Because it's the only thing to do, man.

706
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:54,240
you stay the bars are open till like four in the morning you get to go out

707
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:58,640
wait what else they give you looks like well that's not what you took your cough

708
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:06,120
medicine this is what they give you at uh you kept it well they just gave it to

709
00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:12,240
me yeah this was throw it out they gave it to me they gave me this they gave this

710
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:15,600
This is a piece of plastic to me.

711
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:17,080
That's amazing man.

712
00:33:17,080 --> 00:33:19,080
They gave it to me.

713
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:23,680
They gave it to me.

714
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:27,560
I'm going to have four drams of whiskey.

715
00:33:27,560 --> 00:33:28,560
Four drams?

716
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:29,560
Four drams.

717
00:33:29,560 --> 00:33:30,560
Okay.

718
00:33:30,560 --> 00:33:34,440
Are you going to shoot it or are you going to normal it?

719
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:35,920
I am going to shoot it.

720
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:36,920
Yes sir.

721
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:37,920
Yes sir.

722
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:39,960
No convincing at all.

723
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:42,960
Dude, why does whiskey hurt my stomach so bad?

724
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:43,960
I feel like I'm gonna throw up.

725
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:45,960
I think it's this specific one.

726
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:47,960
I think you're drinking a really bad one.

727
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:55,960
Oh my god, man. This shit is so disgusting.

728
00:33:55,960 --> 00:33:57,960
Actually, that went down pretty easy.

729
00:33:57,960 --> 00:34:00,960
Oh, god, dude. Whose idea was this?

730
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:02,960
Let's get one more going.

731
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:04,960
Yeah, why did we do this?

732
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:05,960
Because...

733
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:06,960
You wanted to.

734
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:07,960
Caleb wanted to.

735
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:08,960
She wanted to.

736
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:12,320
I said it! Caleb wanted to! What did I just say?

737
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:15,280
He wanted to dress up and try...

738
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:18,480
Yeah, first of all, Julio, you didn't dress up.

739
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:25,280
I am rebelling. I'm rebelling against you guys' magical awesome night that I can't even be part of.

740
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:26,280
Oh my god.

741
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:29,280
This is pure jealousy, man.

742
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:31,280
That's what I just said.

743
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:36,480
You're showing your true colors. I'll say it, and I don't want to say this, you're being jealous.

744
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:38,480
Yeah.

745
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:41,480
I actually don't care that my friends are hanging out at an amazing night.

746
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:46,480
I'm gonna be sitting at home.

747
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:51,480
I'm gonna be sitting at home.

748
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:53,480
No you don't.

749
00:34:53,480 --> 00:34:59,480
I did it again. I wasn't looking.

750
00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:02,480
Damn.

751
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:09,480
The Diamond Jelly Bar is a cigar type of vape.

752
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:11,480
Because it's so long.

753
00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:15,480
Uh, vodka.

754
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:16,480
No!

755
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:17,480
Jägermeister.

756
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:23,480
My dad loved Jäger.

757
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:25,480
So that was what was in the house.

758
00:35:25,480 --> 00:35:27,480
And so when I turned like 12,

759
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:30,480
he's like, "It's time to put some hair on your chest, son."

760
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:32,480
And you know.

761
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:34,480
He gave me my first beer.

762
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:36,480
I gave him my first shot.

763
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:38,480
When you were 12?

764
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:40,480
You know, got me fucked up.

765
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:43,480
Your dad got you fucked up when you were 12 years old?

766
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:47,480
Yeah, I mean it only took like three full mixed drinks, but yes.

767
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:50,480
That's a lot, man!

768
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:57,480
I've lived a full life, and I will be ready to die when I'm 40 years old.

769
00:35:57,480 --> 00:36:00,480
Man, your dad is, uh...

770
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:04,000
I'm gonna be I mean he does not sound like a good guy this is not a good story

771
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:10,920
so there came a point like maybe a year after that where he realized that he had

772
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:17,360
a problem and apologized to me and was like I'm gonna become a changed man I'm not gonna drink anymore

773
00:36:17,360 --> 00:36:23,680
and he kind of like really did and took it very seriously yeah I appreciated it but you know

774
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:27,400
yeah if you get to the point where you're drinking so much you're like my 12 year

775
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:29,400
the

776
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:31,400
the

777
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:33,400
the

778
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:35,400
the

779
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:37,400
the

780
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:39,400
the

781
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:41,400
the

782
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:43,400
the

783
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:45,400
the

784
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:47,400
the

785
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:49,400
the

786
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:51,400
the

787
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:53,400
the

788
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:55,400
the

789
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:58,440
It's Arizona State culture, how about that?

790
00:36:58,440 --> 00:37:00,440
And now I actually seriously like beer.

791
00:37:00,440 --> 00:37:01,440
Yeah.

792
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:04,440
You should have started with the whiskey.

793
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:07,440
I actually kind of did.

794
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:12,440
So I did, I had like, maybe I've said this before, but like,

795
00:37:12,440 --> 00:37:18,440
the first time I ever had liquor was me and my buddy John Hamilton.

796
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:22,440
We raided my mom's liquor cabinet and the only things that she had were

797
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:26,440
Hennessy, vodka, and peppermint schnapps.

798
00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:32,360
and we were like 15 and so we filled a red solo cup all the way to the top with

799
00:37:32,360 --> 00:37:37,720
equal parts of each one of these and then we chugged it so we chugged like 16

800
00:37:37,720 --> 00:37:47,840
ounces it was fun I mean I had no idea what I was doing. And just immediately blacked out like just

801
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:53,560
instantly blacked out on the beach. I've never blacked out. I lived near the beach we walked over there

802
00:37:53,560 --> 00:38:01,840
fell asleep, completely blacked out, and then I came to and I was running in the rain back

803
00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:06,040
to my house. It was like torrential downpour, running in the rain back home. And then I

804
00:38:06,040 --> 00:38:09,740
like blacked out again. And then I came to and it was me, the last thing I remember was

805
00:38:09,740 --> 00:38:17,760
walking out of my bathroom and my little brother had an electric drum kit that my uncle Matt

806
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:24,840
had given him and my buddy John was completely naked, dick and balls out, covered in sweat,

807
00:38:24,840 --> 00:38:25,840
playing it unplugged.

808
00:38:25,840 --> 00:38:26,840
That's awesome.

809
00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:31,160
Like, just fucking beating the shit out of it.

810
00:38:31,160 --> 00:38:35,280
It's unplugged, it's making no noise.

811
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:37,600
And then I didn't drink liquor for a year.

812
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:40,400
I don't think I drank liquor until I got to Boston.

813
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:41,720
You hit the skip cutscene drink.

814
00:38:41,720 --> 00:38:44,600
You skipped all the cutscenes for that day.

815
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:47,600
I really did.

816
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:53,720
So I that that scared me off of it and now I vomited like a million times. Yeah, it was so it was so fucking disgusting and

817
00:38:53,720 --> 00:39:01,020
John was like, are you sure we're supposed to drink this whole this much. I was like, yeah, man. I've seen it. Wait

818
00:39:01,020 --> 00:39:07,300
Yeah, dude I did I wanted to do I did everything to the maximum

819
00:39:07,300 --> 00:39:12,800
I was doing way too much of any time I'd ever tried a drug before I was like 22 or

820
00:39:13,140 --> 00:39:18,620
alcohol or anything like that. I always wanted to go full bore instantly and every single

821
00:39:18,620 --> 00:39:21,100
time regretted it and it was a terrible decision.

822
00:39:21,100 --> 00:39:22,100
Yeah.

823
00:39:22,100 --> 00:39:29,020
I only have one real story like that which is that I was a freshman in college and for

824
00:39:29,020 --> 00:39:36,820
whatever reason we were, I bought this breathalyzer, like a $20 breathalyzer, and so we were trying

825
00:39:36,820 --> 00:39:40,980
to see how drunk we could make ourselves. Just like the dumbest...

826
00:39:40,980 --> 00:39:43,460
That was like a really fun game.

827
00:39:43,460 --> 00:39:47,060
Yeah, like see who could blow the highest before like-

828
00:39:47,060 --> 00:39:50,060
I played that game a lot.

829
00:39:50,060 --> 00:39:51,500
Yeah.

830
00:39:51,500 --> 00:39:58,340
We had a handle of Captain Morgan, which is a horrible alcohol drink.

831
00:39:58,340 --> 00:39:59,340
Like just ice?

832
00:39:59,340 --> 00:40:00,340
Captain Morgan?

833
00:40:00,340 --> 00:40:01,900
Oh my god, dude.

834
00:40:01,900 --> 00:40:08,860
And so my roommate and I drank literally the whole handle by like 4pm.

835
00:40:08,860 --> 00:40:15,100
And so the dorm room that I lived in, the way the rooms were set up was it was like two

836
00:40:15,100 --> 00:40:21,760
people in one room and then you had like a lofted bunk bed and your desk below you.

837
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:26,780
So I was on like kind of the far side, I had my record player like right next to it, I

838
00:40:26,780 --> 00:40:30,860
had like a gift for my friend on top of the record player, and then I had like all of

839
00:40:30,860 --> 00:40:36,460
my clothes in a pile directly beside the record player.

840
00:40:36,460 --> 00:40:41,580
And then I woke up, because I immediately passed out from drinking.

841
00:40:41,580 --> 00:40:50,220
I got in bed, and then I woke up and I threw up projectile vomit, just like a beautiful

842
00:40:50,220 --> 00:40:57,900
rainbow arc, all over the gif, the record player, and everything.

843
00:40:57,900 --> 00:41:05,340
And then I proceeded to try and get down from the bed and crawl to the toilet to make it

844
00:41:05,340 --> 00:41:10,860
into the bathroom and just passed out on the ground with my ass out to which a

845
00:41:10,860 --> 00:41:17,780
friend at the time walked in saw that took a picture and then posted it on

846
00:41:17,780 --> 00:41:33,740
on

847
00:41:33,740 --> 00:41:40,740
the

848
00:41:40,740 --> 00:41:43,460
worst nightmare is getting drunk like that now.

849
00:41:43,460 --> 00:41:44,460
You know?

850
00:41:44,460 --> 00:41:45,460
Yeah, it's horrible.

851
00:41:45,460 --> 00:41:51,720
If I get drunk to the point where I'm like, doing any, where anybody on earth could notice

852
00:41:51,720 --> 00:41:55,580
that I'm drunk, that's like my, that's my biggest nightmare.

853
00:41:55,580 --> 00:42:01,820
I want to be fully incognito, nobody has any idea, and to the point where you can't do that

854
00:42:01,820 --> 00:42:05,660
anymore, you gotta, this is a bad place to be.

855
00:42:05,660 --> 00:42:15,880
The last time I was really, really drunk was probably this time that I got in a massive

856
00:42:15,880 --> 00:42:20,100
bar fight in California.

857
00:42:20,100 --> 00:42:24,140
I know I've told you guys this, but I don't think I've ever said this on any podcast.

858
00:42:24,140 --> 00:42:33,520
In 2019 or 2018, when I was living in LA, I guess it was 2019, my brother lived by this

859
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:38,760
trucker bar called the country girl which they demolished recently so I can tell

860
00:42:38,760 --> 00:42:44,480
the story best bar ever it was like two pool tables a trucker bar it was like

861
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:50,240
giant like all 18 wheelers parked in the back they had like a giant lot it was

862
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:57,480
great and we it was me and my buddy Gus's last night in Los Angeles and we

863
00:42:57,480 --> 00:43:01,920
so we went up we had to drive we were starting a drive across the country the

864
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:02,920
next day.

865
00:43:02,920 --> 00:43:05,840
It's really like we have to have one last night at the country girl.

866
00:43:05,840 --> 00:43:10,600
And we get there and everything's fine and then my brother's fiance starts bringing out

867
00:43:10,600 --> 00:43:14,640
Mai Tais that she bought everybody and like Long Island iced teas, like this kind of girl

868
00:43:14,640 --> 00:43:18,740
drink that none of us, like I'd never had one before.

869
00:43:18,740 --> 00:43:23,440
And we all got really drunk and then I had to piss really bad.

870
00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:28,520
I went into the bathroom for like 30 seconds to piss and everything was fine when I went

871
00:43:28,520 --> 00:43:29,520
in the bathroom.

872
00:43:29,520 --> 00:43:36,480
And then I came out of the bathroom and my brother was being strangled like this.

873
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:42,600
And my buddy Gus was on the floor sideways and a guy was stomping on his head.

874
00:43:42,600 --> 00:43:48,020
And so I did what any guy would do and I grabbed all of our pool cues and put them in a bag

875
00:43:48,020 --> 00:43:55,640
so nobody would distract him.

876
00:43:55,640 --> 00:43:59,400
And then my brother noticed that I was out of the bathroom.

877
00:43:59,400 --> 00:44:03,000
And the guy who was choking him,

878
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:04,320
my brother was being choked out,

879
00:44:04,320 --> 00:44:06,800
was pointing at the guy and he was saying,

880
00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:09,960
"Kill him, kill him," over and over again.

881
00:44:09,960 --> 00:44:15,200
So I fight that guy and I get my brother off him

882
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:17,320
and then I go straight back to the pool cues

883
00:44:17,320 --> 00:44:19,320
'cause it was the only thing of value

884
00:44:19,320 --> 00:44:21,240
in the entire bar to me

885
00:44:21,240 --> 00:44:23,960
'cause I'd just gotten a nice pool cue.

886
00:44:23,960 --> 00:44:28,280
and I grabbed the bag and then somebody punches the back of my head

887
00:44:28,280 --> 00:44:32,520
and like it's a giant bar brawl and some random person punches the back of my head

888
00:44:32,520 --> 00:44:35,220
so I turn around and I punch them in the face

889
00:44:35,220 --> 00:44:36,400
and it was

890
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:38,200
guys I don't know

891
00:44:38,200 --> 00:44:39,460
it was

892
00:44:39,460 --> 00:44:42,040
uh... like a forty five-year-old lady

893
00:44:42,040 --> 00:44:46,120
that punched me in the back of the head

894
00:44:46,120 --> 00:44:51,520
and you decked her out

895
00:44:51,520 --> 00:44:53,180
you completely decked out a woman

896
00:44:53,180 --> 00:44:59,980
Yeah, and so we ran out of the bar and we hid under a semi-truck for like two hours and

897
00:44:59,980 --> 00:45:07,100
like the cops came and like tried to look at the security footage and the bartender knew

898
00:45:07,100 --> 00:45:11,100
us so she like deleted all the security footage.

899
00:45:11,100 --> 00:45:15,420
And then we couldn't find Gus forever, we found him in a bush outside of a Taco Bell

900
00:45:15,420 --> 00:45:18,220
like a mile away later that night.

901
00:45:18,220 --> 00:45:24,000
But yeah, then we got home and we kind of had all sobered up and we asked Gus what he said

902
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:26,460
to the guy and he couldn't remember a single thing.

903
00:45:26,460 --> 00:45:31,580
But apparently my brother said that Gus walked up to this guy, said one sentence to him, and

904
00:45:31,580 --> 00:45:36,380
then the guy punched him in the face and started stomping on his head.

905
00:45:36,380 --> 00:45:40,820
And then so we had to go across country, we had to drive across country the next day, and

906
00:45:40,820 --> 00:45:46,340
the entire drive across the country Gus had a giant red boot print in the side of his head

907
00:45:46,340 --> 00:45:48,540
that people any person we met would be like

908
00:45:48,540 --> 00:45:50,140
and then i see me to your guest

909
00:45:50,140 --> 00:45:53,820
what you know that uh... shoe where i can see the size

910
00:45:53,820 --> 00:45:58,140
imprinted like the punisher directly on the forehead

911
00:45:58,140 --> 00:46:01,760
it was awesome and talking also was your it was awesome

912
00:46:01,760 --> 00:46:06,260
uh... he i_d_ i mean against i don't know how they had a good question but it's

913
00:46:06,260 --> 00:46:09,900
yeah yeah definitely had a concussion deftly slept a lot on the road which is

914
00:46:09,900 --> 00:46:13,440
good for concussions i hear right you're supposed to do that

915
00:46:13,440 --> 00:46:17,060
but i don't like that kind of thing i didn't like it then either but i'd really

916
00:46:17,060 --> 00:46:18,720
don't like it now

917
00:46:18,720 --> 00:46:20,040
yeah

918
00:46:20,040 --> 00:46:21,520
the moment you turn like

919
00:46:21,520 --> 00:46:27,320
twenty four it's a conscious decision to get into a bar fight

920
00:46:27,320 --> 00:46:29,440
yeah to be a bar fight guy

921
00:46:29,440 --> 00:46:30,560
is yeah like

922
00:46:30,560 --> 00:46:32,320
you really just never like

923
00:46:32,320 --> 00:46:37,520
also at that bar my buddy sound who's this like sound

924
00:46:37,520 --> 00:46:41,440
we just call him sound his name's martel he's like uh...

925
00:46:41,440 --> 00:46:44,160
he's like a three hundred pound

926
00:46:44,160 --> 00:46:46,560
five foot five mexican guy

927
00:46:46,560 --> 00:46:49,300
and he's like looks like a uh...

928
00:46:49,300 --> 00:46:50,660
uh... bowling ball

929
00:46:50,660 --> 00:46:52,360
and a guy

930
00:46:52,360 --> 00:46:53,980
certified in him

931
00:46:53,980 --> 00:46:58,360
and then pull that in life and stabbed him in the arm

932
00:46:58,360 --> 00:46:59,920
and that happens

933
00:46:59,920 --> 00:47:03,080
and the alexa have that kind of thing what happened as for all the time so we

934
00:47:03,080 --> 00:47:06,580
are i'm lucky that the worst literally the worst in a penny turn that is that i

935
00:47:06,580 --> 00:47:10,200
punched a woman in the face. That was the maximum crime that happened in the

936
00:47:10,200 --> 00:47:16,300
entire night. Well right, nothing happened to you importantly. Yeah, exactly, yeah.

937
00:47:16,300 --> 00:47:19,900
I can take a hit from a girl. I should have known when the hit when the fist

938
00:47:19,900 --> 00:47:24,700
hit the back of my head that it was a girl. Right, but you were drunk, it's fine.

939
00:47:24,700 --> 00:47:30,420
Yeah, I thought that I was running through you. You were worried that she was going to take the

940
00:47:30,420 --> 00:47:35,180
pool cues at some point if you were, if you... That's why football players beat their lives, dude.

941
00:47:35,180 --> 00:47:39,740
because they're drunk and then they assume that whenever someone hits them it's a huge

942
00:47:39,740 --> 00:47:42,020
guy but it's actually just a tiny woman.

943
00:47:42,020 --> 00:47:47,300
And then they hit him and they just, they blow back like it's like the Hulk, you know?

944
00:47:47,300 --> 00:47:48,300
Yeah.

945
00:47:48,300 --> 00:47:52,660
I think that the thing that I've always, that has always bothered me about that story is

946
00:47:52,660 --> 00:47:58,340
always that my first instinct was just protect the things that are worth a hundred dollars.

947
00:47:58,340 --> 00:48:03,500
My brother's being choked to death and I was like, I have to get my McDermott pool cue that

948
00:48:03,500 --> 00:48:10,700
I just got for cost, mind you. I would have had to buy it at retail if it had gotten there's

949
00:48:10,700 --> 00:48:14,880
no way I would have explained to my boss that, "Oh, I got in this giant fight, some guy."

950
00:48:14,880 --> 00:48:18,840
And also that I thought that the people we were fighting were such like villains that

951
00:48:18,840 --> 00:48:22,220
instead of fighting us, they were going to be like, "Oh yeah, I'm going to hit you where

952
00:48:22,220 --> 00:48:25,460
it really hurts and then go snap our pool cues in half."

953
00:48:25,460 --> 00:48:29,180
Well, they might like beat you with them.

954
00:48:29,180 --> 00:48:32,580
But there were other pool cues, like there were graphite house cues all over the place.

955
00:48:32,580 --> 00:48:34,580
Yeah, but then it was nice.

956
00:48:34,580 --> 00:48:36,580
But I should hit you the harder it hits.

957
00:48:36,580 --> 00:48:38,580
No, I don't like violence, man.

958
00:48:38,580 --> 00:48:40,580
Yeah. I was talking to my roommate last night.

959
00:48:40,580 --> 00:48:42,580
He's a skateboarder.

960
00:48:42,580 --> 00:48:44,580
He was talking about how like...

961
00:48:44,580 --> 00:48:46,580
They have such bad attitudes, man.

962
00:48:46,580 --> 00:48:48,580
They do, but he was talking about how like,

963
00:48:48,580 --> 00:48:50,580
you know, the kind of like

964
00:48:50,580 --> 00:48:52,580
weird kind of, you know,

965
00:48:52,580 --> 00:48:54,580
people that might fight you think twice

966
00:48:54,580 --> 00:48:56,580
because the skateboard is like a bludgeon,

967
00:48:56,580 --> 00:48:58,580
you know.

968
00:48:58,580 --> 00:49:00,580
Oh yeah, there's tons of people getting hit with skateboards

969
00:49:00,580 --> 00:49:02,580
Skateboards on video camera.

970
00:49:02,580 --> 00:49:08,900
I mean Karen's don't seem to mind. Karen's? Karen's don't seem to mind the skateboarder.

971
00:49:08,900 --> 00:49:14,980
There's no, no, skateboarders won't, they're not like me man, they don't have it in them to hurt a

972
00:49:14,980 --> 00:49:19,540
woman. Yeah you're a fighter, you're a fighter. They never didn't have to hurt a woman emotionally.

973
00:49:19,540 --> 00:49:25,540
These are the archetypes. You're a fighter, Rex is a thrower-upper. No I'm not a fighter,

974
00:49:25,540 --> 00:49:32,500
that's why, I'm not a fighter. I'm a thrower-upper, I throw up when I drink. That's true. I don't fight.

975
00:49:32,500 --> 00:49:33,340
- Right.

976
00:49:33,340 --> 00:49:34,160
- I've never seen you do that.

977
00:49:34,160 --> 00:49:35,340
- Oh, I'm not gonna do it in front of you, man.

978
00:49:35,340 --> 00:49:37,000
I have manners.

979
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:37,840
- My other friend does.

980
00:49:37,840 --> 00:49:39,880
- And also, I don't do that anymore.

981
00:49:39,880 --> 00:49:40,720
- Yeah.

982
00:49:40,720 --> 00:49:41,560
- I'm not a fan.

983
00:49:41,560 --> 00:49:42,380
- You have seen him do it, actually.

984
00:49:42,380 --> 00:49:43,220
(laughing)

985
00:49:43,220 --> 00:49:45,620
- Absolutely, yeah, he did it very loudly

986
00:49:45,620 --> 00:49:46,940
in our Airbnb this one time.

987
00:49:46,940 --> 00:49:47,860
- Oh, that's true.

988
00:49:47,860 --> 00:49:50,060
- And he destroyed the entire bathroom.

989
00:49:50,060 --> 00:49:53,620
So worried about it for the next couple days.

990
00:49:53,620 --> 00:49:54,860
- Yeah, I mean, it's fine.

991
00:49:54,860 --> 00:49:56,340
- Yeah, so you're a throw it upper.

992
00:49:56,340 --> 00:49:58,100
- We've told that story, right?

993
00:49:58,100 --> 00:49:59,860
- Yeah, a hundred times.

994
00:49:59,860 --> 00:50:02,560
- We went to Carmelo's and the,

995
00:50:02,560 --> 00:50:06,020
'cause you and Cam went home.

996
00:50:06,020 --> 00:50:07,220
- Yeah, and I gave you,

997
00:50:07,220 --> 00:50:10,000
like I took one sip of a margarita and gave it to y'all.

998
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:13,140
- Yeah, who am I gonna fuck up off the margaritas

999
00:50:13,140 --> 00:50:13,980
and the booby trap?

1000
00:50:13,980 --> 00:50:15,540
And then we went to Carmelo's.

1001
00:50:15,540 --> 00:50:18,140
- I don't like how you framed that.

1002
00:50:18,140 --> 00:50:21,460
You were getting fucked up and also poisoning me.

1003
00:50:21,460 --> 00:50:23,840
You were like, I'm gonna get you three margaritas

1004
00:50:23,840 --> 00:50:25,220
and you're gonna drink the whole thing.

1005
00:50:25,220 --> 00:50:26,060
And I was being--

1006
00:50:26,060 --> 00:50:26,900
- That's how I had it.

1007
00:50:26,900 --> 00:50:27,720
- 'Cause I also got three margaritas.

1008
00:50:27,720 --> 00:50:29,740
- I was peer pressure by the entire table

1009
00:50:29,740 --> 00:50:34,740
until two white saviors joined our night and drank.

1010
00:50:34,740 --> 00:50:36,180
- You are literally four inches taller

1011
00:50:36,180 --> 00:50:37,780
and like 50 pounds heavier than me.

1012
00:50:37,780 --> 00:50:38,620
You should be able to--

1013
00:50:38,620 --> 00:50:40,180
- Yeah, you can tank this stuff.

1014
00:50:40,180 --> 00:50:41,780
We're DPS, man.

1015
00:50:41,780 --> 00:50:42,620
- Yeah.

1016
00:50:42,620 --> 00:50:43,440
- No, no, no.

1017
00:50:43,440 --> 00:50:44,500
- I'm a fucking mage, dude.

1018
00:50:44,500 --> 00:50:46,300
I'm fucking doing spells.

1019
00:50:46,300 --> 00:50:47,380
- You have no defense.

1020
00:50:47,380 --> 00:50:48,740
- It was completely hitting me

1021
00:50:48,740 --> 00:50:50,780
and I just couldn't do it anymore.

1022
00:50:50,780 --> 00:50:52,620
And then I had a white savior show up

1023
00:50:52,620 --> 00:50:54,540
and drink the rest of my margarita.

1024
00:50:54,540 --> 00:50:56,940
- Yeah, and then we went to Carmela's

1025
00:50:56,940 --> 00:51:01,940
And I smoked the, whatever, what do they call that?

1026
00:51:01,940 --> 00:51:05,540
Bouncer, the bouncer's weed outside of Carmelo's.

1027
00:51:05,540 --> 00:51:06,860
- You smoked that guy's weed?

1028
00:51:06,860 --> 00:51:09,100
The guy who has fingerless gloves?

1029
00:51:09,100 --> 00:51:10,060
- Yeah. - Yeah.

1030
00:51:10,060 --> 00:51:11,820
- Dude, that's awesome.

1031
00:51:11,820 --> 00:51:12,660
- I know, right?

1032
00:51:12,660 --> 00:51:14,460
That's why I had to do it.

1033
00:51:14,460 --> 00:51:15,380
He offered it to me.

1034
00:51:15,380 --> 00:51:16,980
- We're rolling with Pat, and Pat was like,

1035
00:51:16,980 --> 00:51:17,860
"Yo, check this out."

1036
00:51:17,860 --> 00:51:19,900
And he started talking to the bouncer like,

1037
00:51:19,900 --> 00:51:22,340
and I'm like, "Damn, Pat, that's so cool."

1038
00:51:22,340 --> 00:51:24,380
And then the guy offered Rex,

1039
00:51:24,380 --> 00:51:28,220
and I was just looking and I was so scared.

1040
00:51:28,220 --> 00:51:29,900
- I thought about it and I was like,

1041
00:51:29,900 --> 00:51:33,100
it's in the middle of COVID, I'm completely drunk,

1042
00:51:33,100 --> 00:51:35,180
I shouldn't smoke this guy's weed.

1043
00:51:35,180 --> 00:51:38,280
However, he is a cool black guy,

1044
00:51:38,280 --> 00:51:39,620
I should smoke that guy's weed.

1045
00:51:39,620 --> 00:51:40,780
- You have to, man.

1046
00:51:40,780 --> 00:51:43,700
- And I said, of course, let me hit that shit, my friend.

1047
00:51:43,700 --> 00:51:46,700
- Did you end up buying any weed from Aki?

1048
00:51:46,700 --> 00:51:48,620
- Not yet, he did tell me,

1049
00:51:48,620 --> 00:51:52,500
so the reason I gave Aki my number was because he's like,

1050
00:51:52,500 --> 00:51:56,200
when I re-up, I'm gonna hit you with a sample.

1051
00:51:56,200 --> 00:51:59,840
- Whoa, wait, so you're getting sampled out

1052
00:51:59,840 --> 00:52:01,620
everywhere you go, man.

1053
00:52:01,620 --> 00:52:04,660
- Yeah, people have, throughout my entire life,

1054
00:52:04,660 --> 00:52:06,500
regardless of whether or not I'm in a period

1055
00:52:06,500 --> 00:52:10,180
of smoking weed, have always offered me weed on the street.

1056
00:52:10,180 --> 00:52:14,140
Or asked me where to buy weed, as though I would know that.

1057
00:52:14,140 --> 00:52:16,980
- Me too, man, I think you and me have some kind of,

1058
00:52:16,980 --> 00:52:18,420
not since I shaved my head, actually,

1059
00:52:18,420 --> 00:52:22,480
but when I was fatter and had longer hair

1060
00:52:22,480 --> 00:52:27,180
I smelled bad people would ask me all that which what does that tell you about weed smokers, right?

1061
00:52:27,180 --> 00:52:29,180
People would tell me all the time

1062
00:52:29,180 --> 00:52:32,480
Ask me if I wanted to smoke weed or if I had any weed

1063
00:52:32,480 --> 00:52:35,800
But it doesn't happen to me since I'm bald because people assume that I'm some kind of

1064
00:52:35,800 --> 00:52:44,000
Probably ancient alien or something. They think that you're an athlete that doesn't smoke or drink exactly. Yeah. Yeah. I'm a UFC fighter

1065
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:47,420
I have to clear you Sada. There's no way that I can smoke this weed man. Yeah

1066
00:52:47,420 --> 00:52:50,560
Yeah

1067
00:52:50,800 --> 00:52:57,840
Now people ask me if I want to do steroids that's true because you're so buff. Yep. People ask me exactly people ask me all the time

1068
00:52:57,840 --> 00:53:00,560
Hey, man

1069
00:53:00,560 --> 00:53:09,080
You want to do steroids man I go no man, I'm actually competing in a natural bodybuilding event in

1070
00:53:09,080 --> 00:53:13,960
February so I can't do that shit and then they usually buzz off by them

1071
00:53:13,960 --> 00:53:17,680
What should I become a

1072
00:53:18,040 --> 00:53:24,600
Do bodybuilding no, no the other thing the steroids. Oh my god. Yes, dude

1073
00:53:24,600 --> 00:53:26,600
I would do it for like one year

1074
00:53:26,600 --> 00:53:32,120
Because I think it's funny how you because it's funny how your body looks after you stop doing them

1075
00:53:32,120 --> 00:53:34,720
Have you ever seen the pictures of people who like ex?

1076
00:53:34,720 --> 00:53:41,760
Mr. Olympia's who stopped using gear and they look like fucked up like lawn dads

1077
00:53:41,760 --> 00:53:45,840
Like they they look so so bad and they kept working out

1078
00:53:46,040 --> 00:53:53,000
But it's just they their hormones have this like crazy downswing where you just like can't your body just gets fucked up

1079
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:57,460
So I want that you should go to the warning just get a bunch of steroids

1080
00:53:57,460 --> 00:54:01,840
You can you can go anywhere and get started

1081
00:54:01,840 --> 00:54:10,000
There's a guy who comes to my gym who's definitely on gear but doesn't I really want to take a picture of him

1082
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:12,000
He either is on gear or he has like

1083
00:54:12,440 --> 00:54:15,640
Synthol biceps, you know, they're like fake muscle stuff

1084
00:54:15,640 --> 00:54:24,240
But every other part of him is like completely emaciated skinny and he insists on wearing like skinny jean joggers to the gym

1085
00:54:24,240 --> 00:54:29,600
So he just looks so fucked up, but his arms are like probably 26 inches

1086
00:54:29,600 --> 00:54:34,200
It's so fucking awesome. And then every time I see him, he's just doing arm exercises

1087
00:54:34,200 --> 00:54:41,680
He's like turning himself into a crazy like inhuman animal. Yeah, it's just like a cartoon like a cartoon. He's Popeye

1088
00:54:41,680 --> 00:54:43,680
I don't think you should be doing that, regardless.

1089
00:54:43,680 --> 00:54:49,680
No, like a picture of a beautiful woman or a hot guy, and I just want to have a picture of them.

1090
00:54:49,680 --> 00:54:51,680
No, yeah, I don't think you should do that.

1091
00:54:51,680 --> 00:54:53,680
Okay, well I haven't because again, I get too nervous.

1092
00:54:53,680 --> 00:54:55,680
Right.

1093
00:54:55,680 --> 00:54:59,680
But if somebody, there was a guy who had a ferret, and he was like, "I'm gonna take a picture of you."

1094
00:54:59,680 --> 00:55:01,680
And I was like, "No, you're not gonna take a picture of me."

1095
00:55:01,680 --> 00:55:03,680
And he was like, "I'm gonna take a picture of you."

1096
00:55:03,680 --> 00:55:05,680
And I was like, "No, you're not gonna take a picture of me."

1097
00:55:05,680 --> 00:55:07,680
And he was like, "I'm gonna take a picture of you."

1098
00:55:07,680 --> 00:55:09,680
And I was like, "No, you're not gonna take a picture of me."

1099
00:55:09,680 --> 00:55:13,760
guy who had a uh... a ferret in a backpack

1100
00:55:13,760 --> 00:55:15,600
that was walking down the street recently

1101
00:55:15,600 --> 00:55:19,360
he had like a backpack that had like a plastic back so you could see what was in it

1102
00:55:19,360 --> 00:55:21,880
and it was a ferret. You can take a picture of that

1103
00:55:21,880 --> 00:55:25,120
see but i get i pull out my phone and i'm like he's gonna turn around as i'm

1104
00:55:25,120 --> 00:55:26,080
taking a photo

1105
00:55:26,080 --> 00:55:30,320
but also thinking about it. He wants you to look at it. Yeah he wants you to look at the

1106
00:55:30,320 --> 00:55:33,520
fucking ferret man. Yeah

1107
00:55:33,520 --> 00:55:37,680
but i just don't i don't like that i don't like taking photos of people like that. I think that

1108
00:55:37,680 --> 00:55:40,980
happened to me once where I was like at like a 7-eleven and there was a person

1109
00:55:40,980 --> 00:55:47,160
like with a clear like box or like one of those like bags with a with a cat in it

1110
00:55:47,160 --> 00:55:49,800
and I just took a picture of it and it's completely you can you can do that they

1111
00:55:49,800 --> 00:55:54,260
want you to the biggest the biggest regret that I have is I saw a guy with a

1112
00:55:54,260 --> 00:56:00,960
brand new beard mustache combo that I've never seen before or after uh-huh at Los

1113
00:56:00,960 --> 00:56:06,800
Angeles International Airport he had on one side of his face he had a mustache

1114
00:56:06,800 --> 00:56:13,280
but no beard. On the other side, shaved perfectly, no mustache, and a full beard.

1115
00:56:13,280 --> 00:56:18,240
And that's the coolest guy in the entire world. I mean I just had never seen this

1116
00:56:18,240 --> 00:56:22,280
shit before. I wanted to take a photo of him so so badly. Okay. But this guy's eyes

1117
00:56:22,280 --> 00:56:28,160
were darting around like a flash game teacher. Someone's gonna take a picture of me and make fun of me.

1118
00:56:28,160 --> 00:56:31,800
He knew somebody was gonna take a picture of him. Okay. So I couldn't do it man.

1119
00:56:31,800 --> 00:56:35,960
I know like someone with an animal outside in the world I think that's level

1120
00:56:35,960 --> 00:56:40,480
zero you can go ahead and do it. It's a green light. I think anywhere in the face

1121
00:56:40,480 --> 00:56:45,560
region I think that's a complete 100% red. It was funny you can tell us

1122
00:56:45,560 --> 00:56:49,880
about it you really shouldn't even try to take a picture of it. But you can't walk

1123
00:56:49,880 --> 00:56:54,240
around with that facial hair man. A Popeye guy I think you walk up to him and be

1124
00:56:54,240 --> 00:56:58,700
like yo can I get a pic? Oh that's smart he definitely wants somebody to take a

1125
00:56:58,700 --> 00:57:00,700
- That's a great idea.

1126
00:57:00,700 --> 00:57:01,540
- I'm gonna get a pic.

1127
00:57:01,540 --> 00:57:02,900
- When I go to the gym tomorrow,

1128
00:57:02,900 --> 00:57:05,540
I'm gonna say, man, dude, I am--

1129
00:57:05,540 --> 00:57:06,380
- I just love your shit.

1130
00:57:06,380 --> 00:57:07,500
I love your shit.

1131
00:57:07,500 --> 00:57:09,260
- You are like my goal.

1132
00:57:09,260 --> 00:57:10,900
You are goals, dude.

1133
00:57:10,900 --> 00:57:13,800
Can I please take a photo of you so that I can use it,

1134
00:57:13,800 --> 00:57:16,020
so I can like slowly morph my body to you

1135
00:57:16,020 --> 00:57:17,680
with before and after photos?

1136
00:57:17,680 --> 00:57:21,540
Or actually, a selfie is probably a better idea

1137
00:57:21,540 --> 00:57:23,380
with me and him both doing this.

1138
00:57:23,380 --> 00:57:26,100
- Take a picture of him, yeah, with him.

1139
00:57:26,100 --> 00:57:26,940
I think that's the way to go.

1140
00:57:26,940 --> 00:57:28,940
That's the way to go.

1141
00:57:28,940 --> 00:57:36,620
Ummmm...

1142
00:57:36,620 --> 00:57:38,120
No.

1143
00:57:38,120 --> 00:57:40,120
For sure.

1144
00:57:40,120 --> 00:57:42,620
In New York?

1145
00:57:42,620 --> 00:57:43,620
Yes.

1146
00:57:43,620 --> 00:57:44,620
Yeah.

1147
00:57:44,620 --> 00:57:45,620
In New York probably yeah.

1148
00:57:45,620 --> 00:57:49,620
If you did that in Mexico City, they'd be like, "How did you know I'm in the cartel?"

1149
00:57:49,620 --> 00:57:55,120
Yeah.

1150
00:57:55,120 --> 00:57:57,080
- Well, everyone in Mexico City is completely white.

1151
00:57:57,080 --> 00:57:59,440
Mexico City has been taken over by whiteys.

1152
00:57:59,440 --> 00:58:00,920
Have you heard this?

1153
00:58:00,920 --> 00:58:02,720
- Well, you're there, so yes.

1154
00:58:02,720 --> 00:58:04,720
- I'm not there. - He's not a Mexican.

1155
00:58:04,720 --> 00:58:05,560
- Fucking idiot.

1156
00:58:05,560 --> 00:58:10,200
- What's the, like recently it's been taken over

1157
00:58:10,200 --> 00:58:11,400
by white honkeys? - It's been completely

1158
00:58:11,400 --> 00:58:14,120
taken over by white honkeys that have driven

1159
00:58:14,120 --> 00:58:17,720
the rent prices all the way up to the ceiling in the sky.

1160
00:58:17,720 --> 00:58:22,120
- What is it about whites that make the rent more expensive?

1161
00:58:22,120 --> 00:58:23,440
I've never understood this.

1162
00:58:23,440 --> 00:58:27,120
- They get paid in euros and dollars, mostly.

1163
00:58:27,120 --> 00:58:30,080
- But they don't have to tell their landlords that.

1164
00:58:30,080 --> 00:58:31,840
Just keep paying the old prices.

1165
00:58:31,840 --> 00:58:35,080
- They notice.

1166
00:58:35,080 --> 00:58:37,760
- They notice that they're white?

1167
00:58:37,760 --> 00:58:38,640
- They notice that they're white,

1168
00:58:38,640 --> 00:58:42,480
they notice that they got more money in their purses.

1169
00:58:42,480 --> 00:58:44,160
Like me, I walk around like this.

1170
00:58:44,160 --> 00:58:47,560
- We love to just pay our rent on time.

1171
00:58:47,560 --> 00:58:49,520
- I walk around like this, I got my pockets out,

1172
00:58:49,520 --> 00:58:52,640
I got nothing on me, I got Mexican pesos.

1173
00:58:52,640 --> 00:59:07,680
to

1174
00:59:07,680 --> 00:59:08,680
You need it.

1175
00:59:08,680 --> 00:59:09,680
Oh my.

1176
00:59:09,680 --> 00:59:10,680
Because it's been opened so many times.

1177
00:59:10,680 --> 00:59:11,680
Exactly.

1178
00:59:11,680 --> 00:59:17,360
Hey, for so much cash has flown through this wallet that of course it's completely destroyed.

1179
00:59:17,360 --> 00:59:19,320
Let's see how much cash is in here.

1180
00:59:19,320 --> 00:59:20,320
Looks like about...

1181
00:59:20,320 --> 00:59:22,160
$15 in ones.

1182
00:59:22,160 --> 00:59:23,160
Let's see.

1183
00:59:23,160 --> 00:59:24,160
Well, you're close.

1184
00:59:24,160 --> 00:59:25,160
$5 in ones.

1185
00:59:25,160 --> 00:59:27,600
So, because I did laundry today.

1186
00:59:27,600 --> 00:59:29,160
Otherwise, there would be no cash in it.

1187
00:59:29,160 --> 00:59:35,320
I think I have $12 US dollars in my wallet right now.

1188
00:59:35,320 --> 00:59:37,200
I used to have a real wallet.

1189
00:59:37,200 --> 00:59:38,200
I have...

1190
00:59:38,200 --> 00:59:41,200
I want one of those, man.

1191
00:59:41,200 --> 00:59:44,200
Pull out that card now and let's see what it says.

1192
00:59:44,200 --> 00:59:47,200
What says his name?

1193
00:59:47,200 --> 00:59:51,420
Alright, guys, we have to make it to our fancy dinner.

1194
00:59:51,420 --> 00:59:53,200
Don't show that shit, you fucking idiot!

1195
00:59:53,200 --> 00:59:54,200
Wait, show it again.

1196
00:59:54,200 --> 00:59:57,200
Okay, I'll show mine really fast.

1197
00:59:57,200 --> 00:59:58,200
Don't.

1198
00:59:58,200 --> 01:00:01,200
I'm gonna scan it.

1199
01:00:01,200 --> 01:00:04,200
That was a tile.

1200
01:00:04,200 --> 01:00:16,680
the

1201
01:00:16,680 --> 01:00:23,920
we've enjoyed. What is that noise? That's my pilot trying to locate my phone. This, go buy

1202
01:00:23,920 --> 01:00:28,240
proper 12 right now. I honestly think, I don't even know what to do with this. There's no

1203
01:00:28,240 --> 01:00:32,140
way that I will ever have any more of this whiskey. You should give it to Patrick. Yeah.

1204
01:00:32,140 --> 01:00:36,360
That's a good idea actually. Maybe I'll just bring it to the office. Yeah. I know you're

1205
01:00:36,360 --> 01:00:39,880
Irish and you love being Irish. Here you go. Even looking at this is making me want to vomit

1206
01:00:39,880 --> 01:00:46,080
right now. I barely had one glass of it. Anyway. This is lovely. I think everyone should buy

1207
01:00:46,080 --> 01:00:51,240
This is was 30 bucks. It was not that I wish I got that. I wish I got that proper 12 is really really bad

1208
01:00:51,240 --> 01:00:53,520
Alright guys. I love you all

1209
01:00:53,520 --> 01:00:56,760
See y'all. Thank you for joining. I good night
