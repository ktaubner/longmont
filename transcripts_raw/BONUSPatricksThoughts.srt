00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
You're listening to Patrick's Podcast.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Patrick.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Patrick.

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,000

00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Patrick.

7
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Alright, so, this is...

8
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Wow.

9
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Ooh.

10
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Bless me.

11
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Bless me to high heaven.

12
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
This is a solo episode.

13
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,600
So this is just me by myself.

14
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:36,120
Cameron is busy right now.

15
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:37,160
He's moving.

16
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:42,280
He's moving into a dumpster.

17
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:46,240
He's gonna be living in a little dumpster.

18
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:48,480
It's gonna be really hard to record with him

19
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:53,360
'cause with COVID and everything,

20
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:57,660
he's gonna have to record inside of McDonald's.

21
00:00:57,660 --> 00:00:59,660
to use their Wi-Fi.

22
00:00:59,660 --> 00:01:05,160
But I think the living part, I don't care about that.

23
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:08,160
I mean if he's living in the dumpster, that's his choice, it's his decision.

24
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:14,160
Caleb told me that he ate...

25
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:21,660
He thought he was eating a burger, but it turned out that it was like...

26
00:01:21,660 --> 00:01:24,660
raw or something.

27
00:01:24,660 --> 00:01:34,740
I think he, I think Caleb ate raw hamburger meat and now he's uh, he's throwing up.

28
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:40,940
He's been throwing up, I guess like, he threw up exactly before we were supposed to start

29
00:01:40,940 --> 00:01:41,940
recording.

30
00:01:41,940 --> 00:01:46,340
It's 3 o'clock right now on Tuesday.

31
00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:49,780
He threw up and said he needs to take a nap for an hour.

32
00:01:49,780 --> 00:01:54,660
He also told me, you know, he said he ate a bad burger last night.

33
00:01:54,660 --> 00:01:59,500
He told me that he drank three bottles of Aldi wine.

34
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:04,100
So I don't think it's the burger.

35
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:12,040
I think maybe this guy drank like three bottles of wine.

36
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:16,100
How do you drink that and fucking do anything the next day?

37
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:25,020
If you're drinking three bottles of wine, you're in couch lock for the next 24 hours.

38
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:30,860
That's like, just the amount of sugar and the alcohol in that.

39
00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:32,500
I'm surprised he's not dead.

40
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:33,500
That would kill me.

41
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:34,740
No, that wouldn't kill me.

42
00:02:34,740 --> 00:02:35,980
I'd be fine.

43
00:02:35,980 --> 00:02:42,420
I think I could drink more Aldi wine than Caleb.

44
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:45,420
I could definitely do that.

45
00:02:45,420 --> 00:02:49,940
The other night I drank like... was it like New Year's Eve?

46
00:02:49,940 --> 00:02:52,620
I've been doing dry January.

47
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:53,620
That's what I've been doing.

48
00:02:53,620 --> 00:02:59,940
I'm going to see if I can do a whole month not drinking.

49
00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:04,780
Which is... since COVID started I've been like...

50
00:03:04,780 --> 00:03:11,220
I don't think there's been like... the longest I've gone being sober is probably like five

51
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:12,780
days.

52
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:17,780
I've had at least one beer every day since COVID started.

53
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:19,800
And that's not good.

54
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:21,020
It's not a good thing.

55
00:03:21,020 --> 00:03:26,820
But I think this dry January is gonna reset me.

56
00:03:26,820 --> 00:03:28,020
I think I'm gonna get,

57
00:03:28,020 --> 00:03:30,700
I think I'm gonna get telekinesis.

58
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:32,900
I think that's finally what's gonna happen.

59
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:35,300
I think finally I'm gonna be able

60
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:37,300
to move shit around with my mind.

61
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:42,420
It's probably, probably gonna happen.

62
00:03:42,420 --> 00:03:44,300
Probably really gonna happen.

63
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:48,780
I'm probably gonna become like Cable from X-Men.

64
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:52,700
I'm gonna get the techno-organic virus.

65
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:55,380
I'm gonna sit there, I'm gonna be battling

66
00:03:55,380 --> 00:04:00,380
a demon in my body, a virus with telekinesis.

67
00:04:00,380 --> 00:04:04,260
I'm gonna be battling a demonic techno-virus in my body

68
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:07,820
with telekinesis.

69
00:04:07,820 --> 00:04:11,300
Man, if I, telekinesis is like the one

70
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:16,700
Like, it's definitely the best answer, like the answer to the question, like, "Oh, what's

71
00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:17,700
superpower would you..."

72
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:18,700
No, 'cause flight...

73
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:24,620
Well, you could levitate yourself with telekinesis.

74
00:04:24,620 --> 00:04:29,780
But flight is probably better.

75
00:04:29,780 --> 00:04:33,420
'Cause the ability to read people's minds is like...

76
00:04:33,420 --> 00:04:38,140
If that's your pick, that's kind of sociopathic, I think.

77
00:04:38,140 --> 00:04:40,100
'Cause it's not even fun.

78
00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:42,940
Like it wouldn't be fun at all.

79
00:04:42,940 --> 00:04:50,180
You would like find out that like some priest is like touching kids or something or like

80
00:04:50,180 --> 00:04:55,620
you would just hear somebody's just like darkest thought at some point and just be like, "Ah

81
00:04:55,620 --> 00:05:01,260
shit, that guy's gonna kill himself when he goes home, huh?"

82
00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:02,260
You know?

83
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:08,540
But like flight is like, I mean, you'd have to like look out for like birds and shit.

84
00:05:08,540 --> 00:05:13,380
Imagine you get the power of flight, like you get X-Men powers, you get the power of flight

85
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:19,580
and you like, get attacked by a hawk mid-air.

86
00:05:19,580 --> 00:05:21,980
That would, that would fucking suck.

87
00:05:21,980 --> 00:05:27,140
I couldn't, I couldn't imagine.

88
00:05:27,140 --> 00:05:30,620
Or like some, there's gotta be a bigger bird than a hawk.

89
00:05:30,620 --> 00:05:33,180
Let me look this up.

90
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:35,420
Let me look up bigger bird.

91
00:05:35,420 --> 00:05:40,920
biggest bird bigger than a hawk?

92
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:41,920
The ostrich.

93
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:44,900
Ok, well, that doesn't fucking help me.

94
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:49,420
I should have fucking looked at biggest bird of prey.

95
00:05:49,420 --> 00:05:50,420
There we go.

96
00:05:50,420 --> 00:05:52,740
Yeah, condor.

97
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:56,540
The Andean condor.

98
00:05:56,540 --> 00:05:57,940
Well here's the list I guess.

99
00:05:57,940 --> 00:06:04,940
the 10 largest birds of prey from the website rodentpro.com which is a website... let me

100
00:06:04,940 --> 00:06:15,140
look up more stuff on rodent pro. So this is a website for... I guess this is a... where

101
00:06:15,140 --> 00:06:27,500
is their about section? Company info. Contact us. Company info. Company info. Company info.

102
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:35,340
info. Founded in 1993 in Evansville, Indiana. *Burp* Jesus Christ, I didn't even drink like

103
00:06:35,340 --> 00:06:40,140
soda or anything before this. I'm like gassy as hell. *Burp* There, see, fuckin burpin again.

104
00:06:40,140 --> 00:06:45,900
All I drank before this was water. I don't know why water is making me burp.

105
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:54,380
So, Rodent Pro was founded in '93 in Evansville, Indiana. It specializes in the production and

106
00:06:54,380 --> 00:06:59,100
and distribution of premium quality animal foods including frozen foods, live food.

107
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:06,660
So is this a, ok so this is a reptile breeder.

108
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:12,900
I think, let me, hold on, yeah.

109
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:15,180
Crickets, mealworms, frozen foods.

110
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:25,000
Is this a website that you can buy frozen chickens?

111
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,580
Frozen feeder chicks?

112
00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:30,020
Oh.

113
00:07:30,020 --> 00:07:38,700
What animal do you feed a frozen, like, what animal do you feed a chick?

114
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:40,100
I guess an alligator?

115
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:42,260
I don't know.

116
00:07:42,260 --> 00:07:50,220
Man, I can't imagine a whole business of- that's the thing, I could never go vegan, I think

117
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:52,460
my diet is too impulsive.

118
00:07:52,460 --> 00:08:00,260
I think that I eat what's available to me, but anytime I sit down and I think about,

119
00:08:00,260 --> 00:08:06,180
"Oh, I'm killing an animal to eat it."

120
00:08:06,180 --> 00:08:08,740
I could never be the one to kill it.

121
00:08:08,740 --> 00:08:14,980
I know steak tastes good, but like have you ever seen just like a cow in a field there? They look like

122
00:08:14,980 --> 00:08:18,240
They're so majestic. It's like

123
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:25,320
It does law. I used to there's like a long. There's a farm next to the community college. I went to

124
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:28,520
And I'd have to bike from to and from

125
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:35,380
The school because I don't have a license and there's this farm where they had like a shit-ton of like long-haired cows

126
00:08:35,380 --> 00:08:38,340
and

127
00:08:38,340 --> 00:08:42,980
I would just kind of like sometimes I would just like stop the bike and just

128
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:48,500
look at the cows it's like they look fucking sick dude they look like they

129
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:53,420
look cool as shit I can't imagine like it made me reconsider eating meat and I

130
00:08:53,420 --> 00:08:57,420
did I went pescetarian for a year but then like I think one day I just wanted

131
00:08:57,420 --> 00:09:06,140
ribs and then I just went and got ribs I was like close enough to like not even

132
00:09:06,140 --> 00:09:11,220
eating fish too.

133
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:13,180
But what was I talking about?

134
00:09:13,180 --> 00:09:19,340
Oh yeah if you get power of flight.

135
00:09:19,340 --> 00:09:27,060
Imagine you get the power of flight and like you get chased down by a bird.

136
00:09:27,060 --> 00:09:29,500
That would fucking suck.

137
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:30,900
That would be like the worst.

138
00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:33,380
That'd be the worst fucking thing ever.

139
00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:40,980
Like some, like you're like, "Oh, I'm gonna fly over the Grand Canyon just to see, just

140
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:43,500
'cause like I'm the only one who can do this right now.

141
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:48,780
I'm gonna get like a full view of the Grand Canyon without like having to sit in some

142
00:09:48,780 --> 00:09:54,900
stuffy helicopter and some fucking vulture starts circling you, you know?

143
00:09:54,900 --> 00:09:57,140
Like you're just kinda like sitting there.

144
00:09:57,140 --> 00:10:02,380
You're okay, so you have the power of flight right and you can do like the x-men thing where you just kind of like stand

145
00:10:02,380 --> 00:10:04,740
still in midair and you just kind of like

146
00:10:04,740 --> 00:10:09,160
Like, you know how like rogue would put like it's like the energy field under her feet

147
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:15,460
She's just kind of like levitating like 60 feet above the ground and you're looking at the Grand Canyon and then out of nowhere

148
00:10:15,460 --> 00:10:16,700
just like

149
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:22,140
two vultures just start circling you because they think that you're a dead body in midair because you're just kind of like

150
00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:29,460
looking at the Grand Canyon being like "Oh, this is so beautiful. This is one of the best

151
00:10:29,460 --> 00:10:37,140
sights I've ever seen." And you just start, your shit starts getting pecked out by vultures.

152
00:10:37,140 --> 00:10:43,460
That would suck. That would seriously, that would suck. I'm still looking at this Rodent

153
00:10:43,460 --> 00:10:52,500
Pro website. Live foods. See, okay, so as I was saying, like what I was saying before

154
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:59,340
about like oh like I could never like kill an animal. I kill a bug. I don't I don't feel

155
00:10:59,340 --> 00:11:04,100
bad about killing bugs. I think that's a problem. I think it's just because they're so small

156
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:12,460
like because it's still a living thing you know. Oh you got crickets you can buy a shit

157
00:11:12,460 --> 00:11:36,980
to

158
00:11:36,980 --> 00:11:56,540
of

159
00:11:56,540 --> 00:11:59,540
I mean I could kill a bug. I could definitely kill a bug.

160
00:11:59,540 --> 00:12:01,540
But that's the other thing.

161
00:12:01,540 --> 00:12:08,540
Buying any animal for the express purpose of feeding it to another animal is weird to me.

162
00:12:08,540 --> 00:12:16,540
I don't want to go to the store and get bugs. That's weird.

163
00:12:16,540 --> 00:12:22,540
It's weird to go to the store and get bugs but it's also like,

164
00:12:22,540 --> 00:12:44,620
I

165
00:12:44,620 --> 00:12:46,300
going to make fun of me for this episode.

166
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:56,220
Like oh, oh, he's, he's gonna, he can't feed, he can't eat meat.

167
00:12:56,220 --> 00:13:00,380
Anyway what was I talking about?

168
00:13:00,380 --> 00:13:08,060
Largest birds of prey.

169
00:13:08,060 --> 00:13:14,260
See the thing about hosting it with two other guys is it's a lot easier to just kind of

170
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:20,620
rip take jewel hits in the middle of it without it becoming dead air which is

171
00:13:20,620 --> 00:13:26,700
most of this episode right now is me trying to process my thoughts which I'm

172
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:35,500
already I'm already not good at. Number 10 the Eurasian Eagle Owl. That thing's

173
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:49,660
Jesus Christ. I think I've been, I think owls scare me. I don't know. No, they look cool.

174
00:13:49,660 --> 00:13:58,780
Owls look cool, kind of. Like if I saw an owl in person I'd be, no I did see an owl

175
00:13:58,780 --> 00:14:09,060
in person before. I was like six. Maybe that's why I'm a little scared of them. It's because

176
00:14:09,060 --> 00:14:18,540
I saw the owl and I thought it was going to attack me. Hmm. Well anyway, this owl, if I

177
00:14:18,540 --> 00:14:25,080
fucking, if I saw this fucking owl in person and I had a gun, I would at least fire off

178
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:32,360
a warning shot.

179
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:34,280
Somebody texted me in the middle of that.

180
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:46,480
I, see, this is what, you can't do a podcast like the one that we do with one guy.

181
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:52,680
I'm learning that, this is the, I'm learning this the hard way.

182
00:14:52,680 --> 00:15:05,800
Because I have to have my full attention on the podcast and I can't get distracted by

183
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:06,800
anything.

184
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:10,000
Fuck, maybe I should have taken an Adderall before doing this.

185
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,480
I don't have any Adderall.

186
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:15,720
If I did though, I'd probably be quiet for the whole thing.

187
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:19,520
Just sitting here reading about this Eurasian Eagle Owl.

188
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:26,400
It's up to, it's like a nine pound owl with a two, Jesus Christ.

189
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:30,040
Six and a half foot wingspan.

190
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:34,600
What the fuck?

191
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:41,840
That thing's fucking terrifying.

192
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:45,960
I mean, it's eyes too.

193
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:50,920
Like if you, like staring an owl in the eyes.

194
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:55,080
Fuck.

195
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:56,080
That's terrifying.

196
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:58,080
I should have called someone.

197
00:15:58,080 --> 00:16:02,000
I should have, I should have, I should have called somebody up and asked them if they

198
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:06,160
could record this with me.

199
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:09,680
Number nine, the Marshall Eagle.

200
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:13,960
Africa's largest eagle with an eight foot wingspan.

201
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:37,960
I'm

202
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:47,960
I had a bad dream about a bird when I was like six because of Wind Waker.

203
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:55,960
I thought that the bird from Wind Waker was going to capture my brother.

204
00:16:55,960 --> 00:17:01,960
And I was always like scared of giant birds after that.

205
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:15,880
Maybe that happened around the same time that the fucking owls came to school.

206
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:26,920
This is, this is one of the most insane things they've ever made me do.

207
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:33,240
I'm sitting, I'm realizing I'm in my room by myself.

208
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:49,300
I'm talking about a bad dream I had when I was six into a microphone and laughing to myself.

209
00:17:49,300 --> 00:17:55,760
This is going to be the thing that you're going to, next week if I actually do send

210
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:58,320
this to Cameron and Caleb.

211
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:03,040
Like in two weeks from now they'll just be like, "Yeah, we, um, you know, Pat's been,

212
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:04,920
Pat's kind of been going through something right now."

213
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:12,640
I'm just gonna be in a mental hospital, in a padded room by myself, just like, "I had

214
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:13,640
a bad dream when I was six.

215
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:15,920
I had a bad dream when I was six."

216
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:17,920
*laughs*

217
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:19,920
*laughs*

218
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:21,920
*laughs*

219
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:23,920
Yeah dude, birds are

220
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:25,920
fucking scary.

221
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:27,920
*laughs*

222
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:29,920
*laughs*

223
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:31,920
*laughs*

224
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:33,920
Number 8, the

225
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:35,920
Philippine Eagle.

226
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:37,920
I'm guessing

227
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:39,920
this bird is from the Philippines.

228
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:43,920
Yeah.

229
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:50,900
This one kind of looks like this one's got like a middle part. I mean it's kind of cool-looking. I

230
00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:55,400
Mean it's got like a

231
00:18:55,400 --> 00:19:02,780
This is the worst fucking episode ever maybe

232
00:19:02,780 --> 00:19:08,840
Maybe I should stop no, I'm gonna keep going you know what they said I couldn't do it

233
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:10,880
so

234
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:12,880
I'm getting that message

235
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:15,720
It's adopt... is it...

236
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:20,320
This bird of prey has adapted to hunted forested habitats and is incredibly

237
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:23,840
agile even though it weighs 15 pounds...

238
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:28,840
Fuck! That's a heavy bird! Jesus Christ!

239
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:37,920
The raptor is known to feed on... This fucking bird eats monkeys and like lemurs

240
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:40,040
and... pigs and dogs?

241
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:44,200
What the fuck? I gotta see a video of this thing. Hold on.

242
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:49,240
Let me look this thing up. Philippine Eagle video.

243
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:51,560
Oh, it's endangered.

244
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:56,080
Soaring Philippine Eagle.

245
00:19:56,080 --> 00:20:02,360
Yeah, because I mean, I'm looking at this thing right now.

246
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:04,680
And it's like,

247
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:14,640
If I had the power of flight and I had to like deal with one of these things trying to like

248
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:20,240
attack me, I'd piss and shit myself right there.

249
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:23,920
Like I, that's fucked up.

250
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:27,120
That thing's fucked up.

251
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:29,920
God.

252
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:31,920
Philippine Eagle feeding.

253
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:34,000
Maybe look that up.

254
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
Philippine Eagle eating monkey.

255
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:45,400
Oh no.

256
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:50,300
Oh dude. Oh my god the claws dude. Look at that. Look at that thing's fucking claws.

257
00:20:50,300 --> 00:20:59,480
That thing's nuts. Oh the monkey's just eaten an apple dude or whatever the fuck that is. He's eaten something.

258
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:04,000
How okay if you're the wildlife filmer and

259
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:09,580
You're like you're the guy like filming like wildlife shit you

Just like have a gun on you just it's like oh this monkey's so cute

00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:21,920
But this eagles about to eat it just like fire a warning shot at the eagle, right?

263
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:33,900
Like cuz if I I would want to print if I saw a monkey about to get attacked by a bird I'd be like

264
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:36,600
Fuck out of here bird

265
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:38,800
You piece of shit

266
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:43,860
You know, I I'm not letting a bird attack a monkey I

267
00:21:43,860 --> 00:21:52,420
Don't care if it's a bird of prey or circle like oh wait, they fucking green screen that yeah

268
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:59,240
Wait is this not real? Is this video not real?

269
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:04,780
Oh no, no it

270
00:22:04,780 --> 00:22:08,160
It has the baby monkey in its claws. Oh

271
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:11,040
You prick you prick bird

272
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:14,920
You are you are the worst

273
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:20,960
God I would if I was the wildlife filmer

274
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:24,800
And I saw that bird

275
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:29,480
Grab a baby monkey by its claws.

276
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:32,480
I would keep

277
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:37,280
Like a I would keep like a 44 Magnum with a scope on it in my pocket

278
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:43,600
And I would I would fire just just clip its wing. You know, I don't care that it's endangered

279
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:46,360
You're not eating a baby monkey. Not while I'm there

280
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:49,400
Not while I'm watching this fucking thing

281
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:55,860
That baby monkey I look maybe maybe it's an asshole. I don't know I don't know

282
00:22:55,860 --> 00:22:58,980
But that's not right

283
00:22:58,980 --> 00:23:03,240
Carrot about the circle life, I don't care about

284
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:06,820
Nature

285
00:23:06,820 --> 00:23:10,920
Even though in this hypothetical situation I am a

286
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:19,160
Wildlife filmer and I'm it's my job to care about nature and know how to not disturb

287
00:23:19,340 --> 00:23:26,500
The animals I'm fucking I'm firing off around at that goddamn bird, you know, you're

288
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:31,060
You you stupid bird you prick bird

289
00:23:31,060 --> 00:23:37,100
Man a bird that eats monkeys

290
00:23:37,100 --> 00:23:43,660
That's just that's disgusting that's fucked up to me and dogs

291
00:23:46,220 --> 00:23:50,620
I gotta look up. Oh, this isn't even the right bird. This is a harpy eagle

292
00:23:50,620 --> 00:23:56,620
What what's a harpy eagle

293
00:23:56,620 --> 00:24:08,100
South America, oh I watched the wrong. Well, I mean I still saw a bird cat eat a monkey

294
00:24:08,100 --> 00:24:12,980
None of you saw that because this is an audio

295
00:24:15,260 --> 00:24:18,700
This is an audio based pod- I'm watching another video of it.

296
00:24:18,700 --> 00:24:22,740
Oh wow, they put their own watermark before.

297
00:24:22,740 --> 00:24:26,860
What?

298
00:24:26,860 --> 00:24:27,920
What?

299
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:30,540
The fuck is this?

300
00:24:30,540 --> 00:24:38,380
Okay, this is just somebody giving out information about the Philippine Eagle.

301
00:24:38,380 --> 00:24:39,660
I thought it was gonna be...

302
00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:48,500
a video of a monkey getting eaten by an eagle.

303
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:52,200
Number seven, Stellar Sea Eagle.

304
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:55,940
Found in Russia and Japan, the Stellar Sea Eagle is the heaviest eagle in the world,

305
00:24:55,940 --> 00:25:05,100
weighing 19 pounds with a wingspan of 2.5 meters.

306
00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:09,900
This bird primarily feeds on fish, but is known to attack other large birds and baby

307
00:25:09,900 --> 00:25:16,440
seals. Also I didn't know that like birds of prey were called raptors. I thought that

308
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:25,360
raptors were dinosaurs. But... Well if they're called raptors right then how the fuck did

309
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:31,340
it take us this long to be like... Yeah actually like dinosaurs looked more like chickens than

310
00:25:31,340 --> 00:25:36,820
they do. Or T-Rexes looked more like chickens than they did like a reptile. Like who... Cameron

311
00:25:36,820 --> 00:25:43,820
Cameron probably knows this. If Cameron was here I could ask him. God, I miss Cameron and Caleb so much.

312
00:25:43,820 --> 00:25:46,820
COVID is doing a number on my mental health.

313
00:25:46,820 --> 00:25:50,820
I'm here talking by myself.

314
00:25:50,820 --> 00:25:53,820
About birds.

315
00:25:53,820 --> 00:25:59,820
Oh boy. Alright, I give up. I can't do this anymore.

316
00:25:59,820 --> 00:26:03,820
[laughs]

317
00:26:03,820 --> 00:26:05,820
I've officially lost my mind.

318
00:26:05,820 --> 00:26:14,900
If you got this far into the episode, what the f- what is fucking wrong with you?

319
00:26:14,900 --> 00:26:21,080
But thank you, please subscribe to our Patreon.

320
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:24,300
I guess.

321
00:26:24,300 --> 00:26:29,460
Watch us on Twitch, check out our Teespring, check out...

322
00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:37,320
We don't even plug. I'm just I'm looking for things to say we never plug anything really

323
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:39,960
which is probably a

324
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:42,460
Shortcoming of ours is that we don't plug anything

325
00:26:42,460 --> 00:26:49,840
Who knows who knows if that's even good or bad, maybe you like that we don't plug our stuff I

326
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:56,040
Mean I would I I don't like it when people plug anything you know

327
00:26:56,040 --> 00:27:00,040
Anyway

328
00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:01,040
Huh.

329
00:27:01,040 --> 00:27:02,040
Alright.

330
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:02,040
[laughs]

331
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:04,040
Alright.

332
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:07,400
[LAUGHTER]
