00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,500
[Music]

2
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:10,000
Last time on Wally Wankoff and the Candy Bombs and Toilets Factory.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:18,000
The gang beat the shit out of some turdevils in the run-down toilet/indoor plumbing pipe section room of the factory.

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:24,500
After beating them up, Pinocchio completed his eldritch puberty to become Redwood Fox,

5
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:28,020
A tree man similar to the Kirby tree boss that's in every Kirby game.

6
00:00:28,020 --> 00:00:29,620
That's how I pictured him.

7
00:00:29,620 --> 00:00:30,120
Um...

8
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:32,740
Except it's, you know, sort of like Red, um...

9
00:00:32,740 --> 00:00:34,740
Sort of like Red Fox.

10
00:00:34,740 --> 00:00:41,300
Afterwards, Lady Dibby, the benevolent poop lady, led them to the loose bit of pipe that, when they break through it,

11
00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:45,700
leads them ever closer to the control room so that they can fix the factory.

12
00:00:45,700 --> 00:00:49,460
Um, where it leads them specifically is the bombs room,

13
00:00:49,940 --> 00:00:57,340
Where Wankoff excitedly shows them the one part of the factory that does exceedingly well and has at least, you know, some of his attention.

14
00:00:57,340 --> 00:01:03,860
Wankoff also shows them an experimental weapon meant to bypass Geneva Convention laws around gas attacks,

15
00:01:03,860 --> 00:01:10,420
which I don't really get to explain, um, because Bibby shoots his tooth at the bomb with his slingshot by accident,

16
00:01:10,420 --> 00:01:19,140
and it goes off, dispelling this, uh, pink sparkly mist, and the gang ends up in the Candy Dream Zone.

17
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:23,780
where they are in their most special, wonderful fantasy realm.

18
00:01:23,780 --> 00:01:27,860
Until they're not, because if they don't awaken, they will slowly die

19
00:01:27,860 --> 00:01:30,980
in the bliss that they've created for themselves.

20
00:01:30,980 --> 00:01:35,300
One by one, each of our heroes awaken to the reality that they are in a dream,

21
00:01:35,300 --> 00:01:38,100
at which point the dream turns on them and becomes a nightmare.

22
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:41,620
Bibby is the first to realize this, and helps the others escape

23
00:01:41,620 --> 00:01:44,980
until they see Wankoff's dream world, one that is filled with the pathos

24
00:01:44,980 --> 00:01:48,340
of a guy who should have just worked in computers, but was swept up

25
00:01:48,340 --> 00:01:50,340
by the allure of a rich uncle.

26
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:55,460
When they awaken, they brush themselves off and head off to the control room at last.

27
00:01:55,460 --> 00:02:01,780
Unfortunately, there's a company all hands with the robots going on between them and the control room.

28
00:02:01,780 --> 00:02:05,020
And they all seem to agree that they want to kill nephew Wankoff.

29
00:02:05,020 --> 00:02:10,960
Something is happening in this factory and the gang will finally know the truth in this part.

30
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:14,860
And they will not care very much about it. And that's okay.

31
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:18,680
I'm used to it. It's kind of how I write these at this point

32
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:26,800
Like you noticed the pink sparkle that was coming out of the bomb similar to the pink sparkle in front of the factory in the beginning

33
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:32,780
And I was trying to create some parallels there and I had some ideas about how to thread that and I abandoned it because it's not

34
00:02:32,780 --> 00:02:36,500
Worth it a lot of things you realize as a DM are just not worth

35
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:42,340
You're up first

36
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:46,580
I yield my turn.

37
00:02:46,580 --> 00:02:48,580
[Laughter]

38
00:02:48,580 --> 00:02:50,580
An incredible man.

39
00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:52,580
Okay.

40
00:02:52,580 --> 00:02:54,580
Alright, so what do I have to run down a hallway or some crap?

41
00:02:54,580 --> 00:02:56,580
So yeah, there's like bots in the way

42
00:02:56,580 --> 00:02:58,580
that you can run past and try to brush past.

43
00:02:58,580 --> 00:03:00,580
Basically,

44
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:02,580
think of it like this.

45
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:04,580
You have 60 feet of movement.

46
00:03:04,580 --> 00:03:06,580
The door is probably like

47
00:03:06,580 --> 00:03:08,580
120, 100-ish feet away.

48
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:10,580
The bots

49
00:03:10,580 --> 00:03:12,580
are kind of

50
00:03:12,580 --> 00:03:15,380
you know, scattered throughout that hallway.

51
00:03:15,380 --> 00:03:18,180
So they will try to stop you if you run past them.

52
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:22,580
But we can play that out with just basically they're taking

53
00:03:22,580 --> 00:03:26,080
opportunity attacks as long as you keep moving though.

54
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:28,580
You should be able to outpace the ones that are on the lower

55
00:03:28,580 --> 00:03:31,380
level that are going to be coming up to get you.

56
00:03:31,380 --> 00:03:34,580
What is the door say that I'm supposed to be going into control

57
00:03:34,580 --> 00:03:35,080
room?

58
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:40,280
Okay, I read that as Tootsie Roll room.

59
00:03:42,380 --> 00:03:44,740
But you are 100 feet away, so that makes sense.

60
00:03:44,740 --> 00:03:45,420
Yeah.

61
00:03:45,420 --> 00:03:49,020
I read that as Tootsie Roll Room, and I'm so mad

62
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:51,820
that these robots are in the way of the Tootsie Roll Room

63
00:03:51,820 --> 00:03:52,780
Yeah.

64
00:03:52,780 --> 00:03:55,900
that I go into a rage.

65
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:57,780
That's good.

66
00:03:57,780 --> 00:03:58,540
OK.

67
00:03:58,540 --> 00:04:01,860
You go into a rage, so then we got that table for you to roll on.

68
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:03,380
Because you have Wild Magic Rage.

69
00:04:03,380 --> 00:04:07,820
I got a 2.

70
00:04:07,820 --> 00:04:09,940
Oh, I can teleport up to 30 feet.

71
00:04:09,940 --> 00:04:11,260
Perfect.

72
00:04:11,260 --> 00:04:13,260
That's probably the best one to get in this case.

73
00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:13,760
Yes.

74
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:16,260
And let's see, is that as a...

75
00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:18,260
Where is that table?

76
00:04:18,260 --> 00:04:20,260
Oh, I'm on the wrong character.

77
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:24,260
Is the teleporting like in Jumper and you can bring someone with you if you touch them?

78
00:04:24,260 --> 00:04:27,260
Oh shit, I didn't mean to roll again, I just needed to pull the table up.

79
00:04:27,260 --> 00:04:30,260
I don't think it's the Jumper teleport.

80
00:04:30,260 --> 00:04:31,260
Fuck.

81
00:04:31,260 --> 00:04:34,260
There's specific teleports for that, but I want to see if it's...

82
00:04:34,260 --> 00:04:36,260
They do have the Jumper teleport.

83
00:04:36,260 --> 00:04:37,260
Yes, it is.

84
00:04:37,260 --> 00:04:42,060
If I rolled a little higher, they added it into the game.

85
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:43,060
Yeah, it's a big deal.

86
00:04:43,060 --> 00:04:46,860
Um, jumper fever was sweeping the nation.

87
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:48,760
No choice.

88
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:52,560
When they were developing 5e, you know, at Wizards of the Coast,

89
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,560
they were, they just had that on repeat.

90
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:55,760
It was the only DVD they had.

91
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:58,360
Yeah, it's just you.

92
00:04:58,360 --> 00:04:59,360
I want to make sure.

93
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:01,160
And it says you could teleport.

94
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:03,160
You can use this as a bonus action.

95
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:06,060
So, I mean, you can do your full movement and teleport.

96
00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:11,540
Alright, so I'm gonna do that. I'm gonna I read Tootsie Roll room. I just start fucking

97
00:05:11,540 --> 00:05:16,740
Screeching I'm just like I see that I just go like

98
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:20,020
and then just like

99
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:22,140
kind of like try to like

100
00:05:22,140 --> 00:05:28,220
You know football like what's a linebacker linebacker my way through?

101
00:05:28,220 --> 00:05:29,940
Mm-hmm

102
00:05:29,940 --> 00:05:32,580
Fucking it's me not knowing what?

103
00:05:34,140 --> 00:05:41,140
like

104
00:05:41,140 --> 00:06:00,640
go

105
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:13,320
like

106
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:17,160
now. Oh, well, technically, I guess you used your rage as a bonus action.

107
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:22,760
What do you mean by that? So you can't teleport right now.

108
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:28,680
Oh, so I okay. Whatever you move 60 feet right now and you have teleport later.

109
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:34,360
Oh, I moved 60 feet. Oh, wait, shit. No, because you teleport and then after that,

110
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:39,080
you can use it. Got it. Okay, you're fine. You move 90 feet. You move 90 feet. Yeah.

111
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:42,560
use your full movement, use your full movement and your teleport.

112
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:44,360
You move 90 feet down that hallway.

113
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:47,700
So you just like fucking just blast it through them.

114
00:06:47,700 --> 00:06:50,760
And now it is the robots turn.

115
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:56,800
So the other two guys that missed are going to try to square up in front of you all.

116
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:00,360
Um, and you're going to shoot, uh, what looks like some sort of like what would be,

117
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:08,300
uh, a, uh, sort of like repair or like, uh, uh, you know, uh, the tool laser,

118
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:10,840
but they're reapplying it to hurt you.

119
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:14,140
So they're going to shoot it at you,

120
00:07:14,140 --> 00:07:17,780
Red Redwood Fox, because you are a big tree.

121
00:07:17,780 --> 00:07:21,020
And they see that as like that seems like the biggest threat.

122
00:07:21,020 --> 00:07:22,620
Am I going to catch you on fire?

123
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:27,480
No, unless you want to.

124
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:30,220
No, I don't. No, I don't want to. OK.

125
00:07:30,220 --> 00:07:34,220
Your AC is pretty low, so it's going to end you.

126
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:37,360
Yeah. Yeah. That hits to you.

127
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:41,000
that does three damage

128
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,360
and the other one's gonna shoot at you

129
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:48,680
it hits you. Oh I still can't add or subtract damage

130
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:53,200
I'll fix that for you. Thank you. And it does

131
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:57,160
another three damage. Damn, they're rolling pretty low. Lucky for you

132
00:07:57,160 --> 00:08:02,360
but yeah, so you take six damage from that. The other robots are moving closer now

133
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:05,400
so you're up

134
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:13,800
though, uh, based on my roles here, uh, Bibby. All right. So the, how far away is the door?

135
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:19,720
You said a hundred feet. Oh yeah. And how, how many of those feet are like,

136
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:23,320
will provoke attacks of opportunity? Like how, how far do I need to get?

137
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:32,200
Uh, if you have to, for sure there's there, like I'd say the 60 feet full is like how you're going

138
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:39,640
to get past them. If you go 30, you'll go past one. If you go like 45, you'll go past the other.

139
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:44,120
But like once you're past that 45 mark, you're pretty much past that right now.

140
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:51,160
Because I can, I want to, I'm going to use a key point to use step of the wind. Okay. But there's a,

141
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:57,640
there's a, like a smart thing I could do here or a fun thing I could do here.

142
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:04,200
Because the step of the wind, I can either take disengage, which I don't provoke attacks

143
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:10,440
of opportunity. That's the smart one. Or dash will double my movement and my jump distance doubles.

144
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:16,360
And I'm thinking maybe I can try to jump over all the robots and that might be really fun.

145
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:18,280
I'll of course allow that if you want to try.

146
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:22,120
Okay, I'm going to try to jump over all the robots with my step of the wind.

147
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:25,960
How much? Outline the increases here.

148
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:30,520
Let's see, so, well, so if I take dash I can move 80 feet this turn.

149
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:32,280
What the fuck?

150
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:33,880
Because my speed's 40.

151
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:35,480
God damn it, what the fuck?

152
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:40,280
Why is Bibi's speed 40?

153
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:40,760
Because I didn't-

154
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:41,720
He has no bones slowing him down.

155
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:47,240
He has no bones or blood or anything really.

156
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:49,000
I should have-

157
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:55,480
A jump is my strength score, I think, which is 14, but it's doubled, so that's 28 foot jump.

158
00:09:55,480 --> 00:10:01,280
long jump, which I think also counts as part of my movement. So I don't think I can like

159
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:12,200
go 108 feet. Oh my God. But it'd be cool if I could. I, I, I, Oh God. All right. I'll let

160
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:19,240
you try. Um, yeah, so I'm going to run and my, the way my jump is going to work is that

161
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:27,480
I take off sprinting and I trip and I bounce into the air and I fly 28 feet past the robots.

162
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:32,920
Okay, first I want to make sure, so jump distance, is that really just your straight strength?

163
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:38,040
Yes, so when you make a long jump, as long as you move at least 10 feet first.

164
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:40,360
That's nuts. Okay, cool.

165
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:41,080
Cool D&D.

166
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:46,120
Yeah, you could just jump 14 feet. You're amazing. You're a hero.

167
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:48,120
28, no, I can jump 28 feet.

168
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:49,960
Well for you it's 28 feet.

169
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:50,460
Yeah.

170
00:10:50,460 --> 00:10:54,840
So I guess they're gonna try to attack you while you're in the air.

171
00:10:54,840 --> 00:11:00,840
Um, so they're gonna roll attack rolls on you while you're jumping.

172
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:04,600
Uh, because they're both gonna try to shoot at you, the ones over there.

173
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:08,040
Okay, I can deflect missiles with my reaction.

174
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:12,920
All right, I mean, how, how...

175
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:16,520
How many missiles can you deflect?

176
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:17,800
You have one reaction though, right?

177
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:20,040
I think I can just deflect one.

178
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:21,720
Okay, so we'll see how that goes.

179
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:23,800
All right, let's do this.

180
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:29,400
Okay, so you're flying through the air, this becrutched child.

181
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:31,160
I'm spinning really fast.

182
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:34,920
I like to do it when I bounce in the air and I'm like, yeah, I'm like whirling.

183
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:36,520
Yeah, it's the Matrix.

184
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:39,800
He's got the pipe and he's spinning around over all the agents.

185
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:40,920
Yeah, exactly.

186
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:41,800
And reloaded.

187
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:42,040
Yeah.

188
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:45,720
Okay, that's actually very funny to imagine.

189
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:49,720
The band-aids are flying off of me because I'm spinning so fast.

190
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:53,800
Okay, and they're going to try to attack you.

191
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:57,240
And let's see how that goes.

192
00:11:57,240 --> 00:12:00,280
Um, accidentally, that's too much.

193
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:01,920
Oh, it's not too much.

194
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:02,920
One of them misses.

195
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:03,920
Okay.

196
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:06,680
The other one's going to try to hit you.

197
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:08,960
That's on the bridge right now.

198
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:09,960
It misses also.

199
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:11,400
You didn't even have to deflect.

200
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:12,400
Let's go.

201
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:13,960
And so then now what do you want to do?

202
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:15,800
Now you've landed from this crazy jump.

203
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:38,720
just

204
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:46,200
said you're going to 100 even. I got it now. Okay. Now, Waylon Au Revoir. Do you have any

205
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:49,040
of the same movement craziness that these two have?

206
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:53,480
No, I didn't know you could do- I would have given it to myself if I knew you could do

207
00:12:53,480 --> 00:13:00,560
that. I should learn how this game works. The- So I'm gonna say, I'm gonna say, I'm gonna

208
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:03,840
like look around and I'm gonna say "letter of the law" and I'm gonna touch my nose and

209
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:13,440
say spirit of the law and disappear I'm gonna cast invisibility. Fuck yeah. Yes you cast

210
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:18,660
invisibility and it works you're invisible you have another 30 feet of

211
00:13:18,660 --> 00:13:22,680
movement. Yeah just at my own speed I'm gonna sort of do like a keep on trucking

212
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:29,960
down just like taking my time walking right around those guys. Yeah yeah yeah I

213
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:34,160
I would say they're they they I guess can try to attack you

214
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:43,380
Just because they saw where you were before that but I don't know how successful using condoms. Yeah, they have disadvantage though, obviously

215
00:13:43,380 --> 00:13:52,800
So, yep, one of them got a crit one so I guess his gun jams and he cries and the other one

216
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:56,880
Got a

217
00:13:56,900 --> 00:14:01,780
What is your AC is 12, okay

218
00:14:01,780 --> 00:14:04,220
I

219
00:14:04,220 --> 00:14:06,220
Want to make sure I'm doing this right

220
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:12,660
Invisibility in is it technically disadvantage or

221
00:14:12,660 --> 00:14:16,380
Or oh

222
00:14:16,380 --> 00:14:20,300
It's yeah, it's not really I guess it's kind of DMS discretion

223
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:24,900
They don't have like heat site. Do they know they don't they're just worker bots

224
00:14:26,180 --> 00:14:29,620
Yeah, no, no, so he has no reason for you to know that

225
00:14:29,620 --> 00:14:40,980
Yeah, okay this one does is able to like get you but you're you're only gonna get get let's see how much you can get hit for

226
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:48,140
You take we you take six damage

227
00:14:48,140 --> 00:14:55,160
And you sort of just stop in the middle of your sort of jaunt here, but you made it

228
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:57,200
I would say probably like 25 ish feet.

229
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:58,860
Like this was towards the end of it.

230
00:14:58,860 --> 00:15:01,060
This is the second guy.

231
00:15:01,060 --> 00:15:03,860
And then just roll a constitution saving throw.

232
00:15:03,860 --> 00:15:04,400
You got it.

233
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:07,000
And one thing can I request the guy who's gun jammed?

234
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:10,300
Can I put my like Bugs Bunny style, put my finger in the barrel?

235
00:15:10,300 --> 00:15:12,020
You did that. That's what you did.

236
00:15:12,020 --> 00:15:16,300
Constitution saving three, you said.

237
00:15:16,300 --> 00:15:17,100
Mm hmm.

238
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:20,260
So 15. OK, you're fine.

239
00:15:20,260 --> 00:15:22,560
That's just to make sure you maintain the concentration

240
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:29,120
on being invisible which you can so you're still invisible um so he hits me and i'm gonna like

241
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:38,720
bleed a little and just look down and go like oh dear and yeah yeah okay awesome we are up to

242
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:49,040
uh wankoff's turn wankoff is uh not very fast or very strong he's just gonna try to run and he will

243
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:52,380
probably get shot.

244
00:15:52,380 --> 00:15:54,820
Yeah, he got shot there.

245
00:15:54,820 --> 00:15:56,920
He didn't get shot there.

246
00:15:56,920 --> 00:15:59,320
And he's going to take some damage.

247
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:01,180
OK, all right.

248
00:16:01,180 --> 00:16:04,960
So Wankoff just gets like shot in the gut by one of these like bots.

249
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:09,380
They go, Oh God, oh, somebody, somebody's got to help me.

250
00:16:09,380 --> 00:16:12,180
He looks already looks blood.

251
00:16:12,180 --> 00:16:14,080
That's kind of like how weak he is.

252
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:16,020
It's an escort mission, folks. I'm sorry.

253
00:16:17,380 --> 00:16:21,380
is an escort mission to everyone but me is already at the fucking door pretty much.

254
00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:22,380
Mm-hmm.

255
00:16:22,380 --> 00:16:24,380
Mr. Tree Man, it's your turn.

256
00:16:24,380 --> 00:16:25,380
Great.

257
00:16:25,380 --> 00:16:26,380
Mm-hmm.

258
00:16:26,380 --> 00:16:27,380
Okay.

259
00:16:27,380 --> 00:16:30,940
Um, can I?

260
00:16:30,940 --> 00:16:32,380
I have Misty Step.

261
00:16:32,380 --> 00:16:35,220
Oh, why did you have Misty Step?

262
00:16:35,220 --> 00:16:36,220
You're a tree.

263
00:16:36,220 --> 00:16:37,220
That's all.

264
00:16:37,220 --> 00:16:38,220
That rocks.

265
00:16:38,220 --> 00:16:39,780
Yeah, I have Misty Step.

266
00:16:39,780 --> 00:16:41,020
I can believe it.

267
00:16:41,020 --> 00:16:42,020
Yeah.

268
00:16:42,020 --> 00:16:43,020
Me too.

269
00:16:43,020 --> 00:16:44,020
I don't know why I gave you that.

270
00:16:44,020 --> 00:16:45,020
Okay, yeah.

271
00:16:45,020 --> 00:16:46,020
So can I?

272
00:16:46,020 --> 00:16:51,300
really have control over my branches, but can I bend over and kind of like catch the neck

273
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:55,100
of Wankoff's t-shirt and then do Misty Step?

274
00:16:55,100 --> 00:16:59,500
So Misty Step you can't tech- well actually, here's the thing. Misty Step you technically

275
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:02,300
are- it's not, again, the jumper spell.

276
00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:03,300
Yeah.

277
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:04,300
Sorry, I have a-

278
00:17:04,300 --> 00:17:07,900
It's really hard for me to get my brain out of jumper mode.

279
00:17:07,900 --> 00:17:08,900
It's not Misty Jump.

280
00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:09,900
Oh, my bad.

281
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:16,900
that

282
00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:30,780
is

283
00:17:30,780 --> 00:17:46,660
the

284
00:17:46,660 --> 00:18:01,420
this

285
00:18:01,420 --> 00:18:19,940
a

286
00:18:19,940 --> 00:18:32,380
the

287
00:18:32,380 --> 00:18:40,140
one day and say thank you. You have a good berry. Like you have like a good berry you

288
00:18:40,140 --> 00:18:45,040
can cast at will. So you just have like berries on your branches that he can eat and heal

289
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:51,260
HP. You know where my berries are? Yeah. Oh hell no. Oh god. He's like where where. Stay

290
00:18:51,260 --> 00:18:59,500
away from those Wankoff. Where are the berries? Between my damn legs brother! You have. I

291
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:06,400
I just dip them they don't even hit your mouth. They hit your eyes. Oh, oh god. Yeah. I feel better though

292
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:11,060
That's right. Why are they a little boy two hours ago?

293
00:19:11,060 --> 00:19:17,220
Yeah, cool

294
00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:19,900
So we're back to the top of the order Pat

295
00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:24,260
John candy Jonathan candy. Mm-hmm. Am I still in rage?

296
00:19:24,260 --> 00:19:27,940
Yeah

297
00:19:27,940 --> 00:19:33,260
Okay, there any enemies close to me like I'm like near the door now right like I'm like 10 feet away

298
00:19:33,260 --> 00:19:38,380
Yeah, you're pretty close to the door. I would say like after this turn. There's gonna be you could see that there are

299
00:19:38,380 --> 00:19:43,060
Enemies that are coming down from the rafters above they're gonna start jumping down as well

300
00:19:43,060 --> 00:19:50,100
Jump down right now. They can't jump down now. I have to wait till their turn. It's a stupid part of this stupid game

301
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:56,780
Mm-hmm. I was just gonna say I'm like so mad. Well, how about this? I'm so mad

302
00:19:57,460 --> 00:20:04,460
and

303
00:20:04,460 --> 00:20:23,060
my

304
00:20:23,060 --> 00:20:28,740
you're in rage you get a uh you get advantage on strength checks uh-huh um and you get additional

305
00:20:28,740 --> 00:20:35,780
pluses on the strength checks as well um or you just get an advantage and then well i accidentally

306
00:20:35,780 --> 00:20:42,420
rolled four times okay this will count the first two yeah we will count the first two um and lucky

307
00:20:42,420 --> 00:20:47,940
you yeah one of them's a a dirty 20 yeah you bang it down and two of the robots fall they're going

308
00:20:47,940 --> 00:20:56,660
going to take some fall damage. I almost wrote the role in the zoom chat. Okay, should have.

309
00:20:56,660 --> 00:21:04,340
I know it would have been sick. They're gonna take some fall damage. All right, not ideal

310
00:21:04,340 --> 00:21:11,300
for them. So now we want to do they're like, what happened? I thought I was up there. I

311
00:21:11,300 --> 00:21:19,540
thought you were up there and then they see you and they go uh-oh I just go pig

312
00:21:19,540 --> 00:21:26,680
okay I take my I take my whip out mm-hmm I just fucking slap one of them your

313
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:33,600
belt yeah for nine you miss with that nine so you squeal like a freaky pig and

314
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:39,700
then you whip the air they think it might be an intimidation tactic so so you

315
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:42,900
you don't look like a total jackass.

316
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:45,500
It is their turn now.

317
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:47,820
And they're gonna, you know, go like, "Kill, nephew!"

318
00:21:47,820 --> 00:21:51,340
And they're gonna come at you and, like, you see that their hand that has, like, a laser

319
00:21:51,340 --> 00:21:53,780
on it, and it turns into, like, a saw, and it's like, "Zzzzzzzz!"

320
00:21:53,780 --> 00:21:57,100
And they're gonna try to come at you with the saw.

321
00:21:57,100 --> 00:21:58,100
Damn.

322
00:21:58,100 --> 00:21:59,100
Mm-hmm.

323
00:21:59,100 --> 00:22:02,380
I have no more moves?

324
00:22:02,380 --> 00:22:04,940
No, it's their turn, especially.

325
00:22:04,940 --> 00:22:05,940
Oh!

326
00:22:05,940 --> 00:22:06,940
Yeah, dude.

327
00:22:06,940 --> 00:22:08,580
I, damn, I whiff that.

328
00:22:08,580 --> 00:22:23,580
the

329
00:22:23,580 --> 00:22:29,260
other one whiffs. The other two laser guys are gonna try to shoot at Wankoff

330
00:22:29,260 --> 00:22:36,420
who's on the tree right now. Though he did gain some health back from the

331
00:22:36,420 --> 00:22:42,420
good berries that you threw into his mouth or his eyes rather. So they're

332
00:22:42,420 --> 00:22:44,920
gonna try to shoot at him because they're now like killed a nephew they

333
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:50,660
kind of identified who it is. And one of them misses and one of them does connect

334
00:22:50,660 --> 00:23:15,180
I

335
00:23:15,180 --> 00:23:17,620
Well now there's robots between me and the door.

336
00:23:17,620 --> 00:23:19,060
Yes, that's correct.

337
00:23:19,060 --> 00:23:20,220
Thanks Pat.

338
00:23:20,220 --> 00:23:30,140
I guess I just have to try and go, I'm going to try and go to the door.

339
00:23:30,140 --> 00:23:33,700
Can I take, how does the disengage work?

340
00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:36,460
Can I take that without, can I just take that?

341
00:23:36,460 --> 00:23:38,060
What kind of action is that?

342
00:23:38,060 --> 00:23:43,340
So disengage is an action action, so it's like instead of moving or instead of attacking

343
00:23:43,340 --> 00:23:44,420
you would disengage.

344
00:23:44,420 --> 00:23:49,460
That said, Step of the Wind does allow you to disengage as a bonus action.

345
00:23:49,460 --> 00:23:51,460
Yeah, but I don't want to spend any key points.

346
00:23:51,460 --> 00:23:53,460
But I can take it just normally, right?

347
00:23:53,460 --> 00:23:55,460
Yes, you can just normally take it.

348
00:23:55,460 --> 00:24:02,460
Yeah, I'm going to use my attack to action to disengage and then I'm just going to go to the door and try to go through the door.

349
00:24:02,460 --> 00:24:04,460
For sure, yeah. Yeah, that makes sense.

350
00:24:04,460 --> 00:24:06,460
So, yeah, and you get to the door.

351
00:24:06,460 --> 00:24:10,540
get to the door I mean in that case if the way that I'm picturing this which is

352
00:24:10,540 --> 00:24:17,700
that the bots fell between you and John Candy and if they're within range of you

353
00:24:17,700 --> 00:24:23,820
then you're able to disengage and then I limbo and then use a move yeah and then

354
00:24:23,820 --> 00:24:29,460
use a movement action and it's very noodley when I guess nice and yeah and so

355
00:24:29,460 --> 00:24:32,220
you get to the door you're there you can get to the control room if you want to

356
00:24:32,220 --> 00:24:46,600
to

357
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:53,420
to be functioning normally. You could see CCTV cameras watching different areas of the factory.

358
00:24:53,420 --> 00:24:57,720
You could see like that entrance way that we saw before with the tech corporate HQ kind

359
00:24:57,720 --> 00:25:04,640
of thing. The chocolate room, the toilet room, the bombs room, see the front yard outside,

360
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:09,160
several angles from outside the dome, just watching those the dome go like opening up

361
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:15,120
and letting trucks out and different planes out and stuff. And you also see Wankoff nephew,

362
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:22,080
Wankoff nephew bedroom. He's got posters of the sci-fi original series of Dune starring James

363
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:31,200
McAvoy. The IT has an IT crowd box set, a Master Chief statue and a Cortana pin up on his wall.

364
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:35,920
I just roll over him and kill him immediately. Mercy kill.

365
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:40,240
He's a specific kind of older millennial and I don't think that's nice.

366
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:45,840
And yeah, and so that's what you see in the room.

367
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:46,840
Sure.

368
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:47,840
Yeah.

369
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:52,320
And you also have one screen that just shows blackness.

370
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:53,400
You don't know what that is.

371
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:55,000
Yeah, I'm watching it like TV.

372
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,000
Yeah.

373
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,000
Yeah.

374
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:01,120
Probably better than anything Bibi's ever seen.

375
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:04,160
Cool.

376
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:06,120
It is your turn, Waylon Au Revoir.

377
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:09,600
So I'm still way back and I'm invisible

378
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:14,440
Can that guy who shot me does he have like a sort of a sense of where I am?

379
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:22,720
The guy who shot you did yeah, he does but I'm not I'm not gonna give him like I'm not gonna say he has like regular

380
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:26,120
Advantage on regular hitting you you're so invisible

381
00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:29,160
Well, I'm gonna try to appeal to him and I'm gonna like throw my voice

382
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:35,120
Who doesn't quite know where I'm coming from cool and I'm gonna say brother brother you're fighting the wrong you're fighting the symptom

383
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:40,080
not the disease. If you want to get the nephews, you need to kill my uncle.

384
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:45,480
If you kill my uncle, then I'm no longer a nephew and he can't keep-

385
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:49,580
because if you kill me he's just gonna keep making nephews. This is true, this is a

386
00:26:49,580 --> 00:26:56,160
good point. Roll persuasion. Yeah. It's crazy. This is genius. Yeah, it's a good point

387
00:26:56,160 --> 00:27:01,440
that uncles do just spawn nephews. Yeah. Yeah, they asexually reproduce.

388
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:03,440
So that's a dirty 20.

389
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:04,440
Good god.

390
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:07,440
I hate that about your character.

391
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:11,440
It's completely broken, I shouldn't have that.

392
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:19,440
Yeah, the robot is sort of like, thinking about it, says, "Perhaps recalibrate strategy.

393
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:21,440
Kill uncles.

394
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:22,440
Kill uncles."

395
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:25,080
And it turns to where Pat is.

396
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:28,440
It starts barreling down that way towards John Campion.

397
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:29,440
What?

398
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:30,440
What?

399
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:38,800
But yeah, you can definitely like more easily sort of, uh, you can just like walk through

400
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:39,960
this at this point, I think.

401
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:42,600
Oh, yeah, I dust my hands off and I can.

402
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:43,600
Yeah, great.

403
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:44,600
Oh, not me.

404
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:45,600
Yeah.

405
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:46,600
So you're a lot closer now.

406
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:50,840
You're like walking alongside that robot invisible at this point, like, like you're both going

407
00:27:50,840 --> 00:27:51,840
in the same direction.

408
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:52,840
Yeah, I'm just shooting the breeze.

409
00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:53,840
Yeah.

410
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:55,600
So what are you like six?

411
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:56,600
Seven.

412
00:27:56,600 --> 00:27:57,600
I'm seven.

413
00:27:57,600 --> 00:27:58,600
And three quarters?

414
00:27:58,600 --> 00:27:59,880
And three quarters?

415
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:01,000
And one quarter.

416
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:05,000
Oh, that's pretty... I'm a robot.

417
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,760
What, are you like Paw Patrol?

418
00:28:06,760 --> 00:28:11,240
Can't say I've seen it.

419
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:12,680
Oh, you haven't lived.

420
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:22,200
And yeah, it's Wankoff's turn. Wankoff is scurrying up the branch. That is you, Redwood Fox.

421
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:25,640
I'm giggling because it tickles me.

422
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:27,480
Please stop giggling.

423
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:41,160
like

424
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:55,160
that

425
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:58,080
mass group at the company town hall.

426
00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:01,720
What is spider climb?

427
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:04,560
Spider climb allows you to walk on walls.

428
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:05,800
Okay.

429
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:07,040
Okay.

430
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:12,760
I'm an 8 foot tree that can walk on walls.

431
00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:13,760
Yeah.

432
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:18,840
I feel like I could kind of just scare them away by doing that.

433
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:22,200
Can I, alright, let me, I'm going to attack somebody.

434
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:23,240
Okay.

435
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:31,160
me. So there's a guy, there's, there's a guy in front of you, or rather, there's a guy behind you,

436
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:37,080
who's been a who's been shooting at Wankoff. And there's another guy who is sort of making his way

437
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:44,360
towards the the entrance. And then there's the two other guys over there already. So there's three

438
00:29:44,360 --> 00:29:49,000
bots closer towards the control room. There's one bot that's behind you that's going after Wankoff.

439
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:52,040
And then there's the army that's kind of slowly filing up the stairs

440
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:55,400
Okay, um

441
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:58,840
I guess i'll attack one of the three that are between me in the control room

442
00:29:58,840 --> 00:30:02,520
And I'll I will use uh eldritch blast

443
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:04,680
Hell, yeah

444
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:05,880
I'm, sorry

445
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:07,880
warlock staple

446
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:10,920
11

447
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:12,920
Um, look at their ac

448
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:16,440
That's not quite enough to hit them

449
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:29,520
the

450
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:49,340
a

451
00:30:49,340 --> 00:31:01,780
the

452
00:31:01,780 --> 00:31:16,460
the

453
00:31:16,460 --> 00:31:28,900
the

454
00:31:28,900 --> 00:31:35,900
that

455
00:31:35,900 --> 00:31:39,900
and then you know the rest of the scene I already painted.

456
00:31:39,900 --> 00:31:40,900
Mm-hmm.

457
00:31:40,900 --> 00:31:41,900
Mm-hmm.

458
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:42,900
Um...

459
00:31:42,900 --> 00:31:45,900
Shit, what else can I do?

460
00:31:45,900 --> 00:31:50,900
You can go to the door and just... you're 10 feet away.

461
00:31:50,900 --> 00:31:53,900
Yeah, I guess I'll just go to the door.

462
00:31:53,900 --> 00:31:54,900
Yeah, you'll have to...

463
00:31:54,900 --> 00:31:57,900
I double birds flip them off and walk to the door.

464
00:31:57,900 --> 00:32:02,900
Yeah, you could take a disengage action, just get away from them, walk to the door.

465
00:32:02,900 --> 00:32:07,700
Canonically in this campaign, the disengage action is just flipping people off.

466
00:32:07,700 --> 00:32:13,060
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I'm done. Yeah. It's saying I'm done and flipping them off. And then they're like,

467
00:32:13,060 --> 00:32:20,260
"Oh, all right. Shit. He's done. What am I going to do?" He said, "He's done." Yeah. You just flip

468
00:32:20,260 --> 00:32:29,700
them off and walk to the door. It's now the robot's turn. The robot's group is now very much on that

469
00:32:29,700 --> 00:32:34,140
platform. And so they are coming towards you guys towards the

470
00:32:34,140 --> 00:32:41,180
control room. The other two, you know, john candy and and Bibi

471
00:32:41,180 --> 00:32:45,820
are sort of in this doorway. They're going to come after I

472
00:32:45,820 --> 00:32:48,420
guess like they can, they're gonna try to come after you guys

473
00:32:48,420 --> 00:32:51,700
while you're in the doorway. Because if you haven't shut it

474
00:32:51,700 --> 00:33:05,180
yet. Let's see how they do, those two guys. Let's just make this nice and easy. Yeah,

475
00:33:05,180 --> 00:33:15,260
one of them misses you and one of them does hit you, John Candy, for 7 damage. Another

476
00:33:15,260 --> 00:33:20,340
7 damage. If John Candy holds me out in front of him like a human shield, I can deflect the

477
00:33:20,340 --> 00:33:38,060
this

478
00:33:38,060 --> 00:33:43,220
hit mr. Wankoff he does four damage but Wankoff will eat good berries on his

479
00:33:43,220 --> 00:33:48,860
turn he'll be okay you know I just given him the berries every fucking every turn

480
00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:56,600
he's eating them off your leaves he's just trying to bet he is yeah and your

481
00:33:56,600 --> 00:34:00,300
branches rather you don't need berries don't grow on I'll grow on the leaf

482
00:34:00,300 --> 00:34:07,300
that's all I will and you're up baby okay I mean yeah I'm gonna jump into

483
00:34:07,300 --> 00:34:12,100
John Candy's arms and just like like go like star shape like arms and legs

484
00:34:12,100 --> 00:34:18,900
straight out to try and block any incoming perfect projectiles. Awesome

485
00:34:18,900 --> 00:34:27,900
cool and so now you're up Waylon. Okay so I'm going to I'm like I think I've made

486
00:34:27,900 --> 00:34:32,740
it like 50 feet so far so I'm still like I got a ways to go so I'm just walking

487
00:34:32,740 --> 00:34:39,460
towards. Yeah, if you use your full movement, you can get there, but then you can't disengage

488
00:34:39,460 --> 00:34:42,900
from the bots. So you could do that. You would just risk getting attacked by the two that

489
00:34:42,900 --> 00:34:47,940
are up there. Well, I gotta get close. I'm gonna walk all the way and I'm just gonna

490
00:34:47,940 --> 00:34:52,900
and I'm gonna like tug at my collar like, "Yeah, hope they don't..." Wait, does he still provoke?

491
00:34:52,900 --> 00:34:56,900
Oh, wait, shit, you're invisible. Yeah, I forgot you're invisible. Yeah, you just walk past them.

492
00:34:56,900 --> 00:35:00,660
I'm sorry. Oh, great. I should have thought about that. Thank you, Cam. Yeah, you just walk past

493
00:35:00,660 --> 00:35:06,660
You're there, and now you're up, Redwood Fox.

494
00:35:06,660 --> 00:35:12,660
Okay, um, there's still two in front of me? Or is there still three?

495
00:35:12,660 --> 00:35:16,660
There's one behind you, trailing behind, shooting at Wankoff. There's two in front of you.

496
00:35:16,660 --> 00:35:19,660
Okay. And then there's the crowd that's coming.

497
00:35:19,660 --> 00:35:37,660
the

498
00:35:37,660 --> 00:35:44,600
definitely let you try that yeah okay it's kind of crazy to think like you're

499
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:52,020
just going up like you're crazy it's crazy pants let me tell you that um okay

500
00:35:52,020 --> 00:35:57,020
so yeah one willing creature you touch which in this case is you and you're

501
00:35:57,020 --> 00:36:05,660
able to cross verticals. This is so funny. It's funny because he's huge. Yeah, yeah.

502
00:36:05,660 --> 00:36:10,700
So you're just like walking up, Rakov has to hold on for dear life, berries are falling

503
00:36:10,700 --> 00:36:16,220
into his mouth from the treetop, and you're using the rest of your movement, the other

504
00:36:16,220 --> 00:36:21,740
30 feet of your movement to get there. You're not going to provoke any opportunity attacks

505
00:36:21,740 --> 00:36:25,820
yet because you're not up on those guys, but they are going to have a harder time hitting

506
00:36:25,820 --> 00:36:32,900
you when it's their turn. But you're closer now. Back to top of the order, Pat. You are

507
00:36:32,900 --> 00:36:36,580
in the control room. You can do stuff in the control room if you're trying to unclog the

508
00:36:36,580 --> 00:36:43,020
toilet or shut something down. I'm just swinging my fists everywhere. I'm

509
00:36:43,020 --> 00:36:48,100
punching monitors and stuff. I'm pissed off that this is not the Tootsie Roll room.

510
00:36:48,100 --> 00:36:51,220
I'm still in your hands while you're doing it.

511
00:36:51,220 --> 00:36:56,020
Okay, yeah, you're just crushed beating the shit out of monitors.

512
00:36:56,020 --> 00:37:03,420
And it's it's the control room is like going like it's starting to react.

513
00:37:03,420 --> 00:37:08,020
Not well to that kind of that kind of action.

514
00:37:08,020 --> 00:37:12,320
You see the robots are like moving faster and then slower.

515
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:14,420
They're spinning around.

516
00:37:14,420 --> 00:37:17,720
It's it's you hear some noise from another part of the factory.

517
00:37:17,720 --> 00:37:24,200
it sounds maybe like an explosion. You're not really solving anything though by doing that.

518
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:29,960
You're just sort of hitting shit. Is there like a big red button in this room?

519
00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:32,920
Can I do an investigation check for a big red button?

520
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:37,320
You could certainly do one while you're waiting for Wankoff who probably knows where shit is.

521
00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:38,760
You could try to see if you could shut things down.

522
00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:40,600
I got an eight. Yeah.

523
00:37:40,600 --> 00:37:44,200
There's a lot of buttons and they're all different colors.

524
00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:55,320
And that's just a rub. I'm just pressing every red one. Okay. Yeah. You just, I mean, it's, it's,

525
00:37:55,320 --> 00:38:02,840
it's indescribable. Let's put it that way. There are you, you look at the camera and you see the,

526
00:38:02,840 --> 00:38:07,640
the chocolate room starts to have a whirlpool. You see the frogs going down this whirlpool.

527
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:10,760
they're just like, "AHHHHHHHHH!"

528
00:38:10,760 --> 00:38:15,760
Like, like, you see, uh, uh, in the, uh, uh, the bombs room,

529
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:19,260
you see some of the robots are kissing the bombs somehow,

530
00:38:19,260 --> 00:38:23,260
and one of them is blowing up in their face, and they're looking at the camera and blinking twice.

531
00:38:23,260 --> 00:38:25,260
It is, it is, uh, like, no--

532
00:38:25,260 --> 00:38:26,260
What a woman!

533
00:38:26,260 --> 00:38:27,260
Yeah!

534
00:38:27,260 --> 00:38:28,760
[laughter]

535
00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:30,760
Nothing good is happening.

536
00:38:30,760 --> 00:38:36,260
Uh, uh, and, uh, the robots that are approaching you guys from the back,

537
00:38:36,260 --> 00:38:38,820
some of them are moving a bit faster now.

538
00:38:38,820 --> 00:38:41,780
Uh, because you're okay. I hit every green button now.

539
00:38:41,780 --> 00:38:43,940
Okay, we're gonna move to a different turn.

540
00:38:43,940 --> 00:38:50,740
That's your action. The robots are up. The robot crowd is approaching you, Caleb.

541
00:38:50,740 --> 00:38:54,660
Um, uh, you're far enough ahead that they can't quite reach you,

542
00:38:54,660 --> 00:38:57,460
but a few of them can try to shoot at you. And so they will.

543
00:38:57,460 --> 00:39:02,340
Um, I only have seven HP.

544
00:39:02,340 --> 00:39:03,940
Yeah.

545
00:39:03,940 --> 00:39:04,740
Oh, God.

546
00:39:06,020 --> 00:39:10,100
I will say the spider climb is going to give you some advantage here

547
00:39:10,100 --> 00:39:16,460
Because you are kind of perplexing them. It's not a part of their protocol. Hmm

548
00:39:16,460 --> 00:39:26,080
Let's see, what is your AC again? Is it 10 10? Yeah, I gave you very low AC pretty low for a giant evil tree

549
00:39:26,080 --> 00:39:30,780
Well, the idea is that you could very easily be hit but you should have more HP, but you don't

550
00:39:31,580 --> 00:39:36,700
So I have 21 HP. Yeah. So yeah, you take two damage from one of the shots

551
00:39:36,700 --> 00:39:40,860
From the back

552
00:39:40,860 --> 00:39:45,100
The other one's gonna try to shoot at Wank off again. Can I eat my own berries?

553
00:39:45,100 --> 00:39:48,700
No bit of a crass question, but yeah, right

554
00:39:48,700 --> 00:39:52,560
And oh, he got a crit on Wank off

555
00:39:58,020 --> 00:40:05,060
Wankoff is knocked out. He's just knocked out on your tree. He is falling to the ground. Oh my god

556
00:40:05,060 --> 00:40:12,020
And uh, he started falling right at kind of the the apex of my spider climb

557
00:40:12,020 --> 00:40:22,140
That sucks and the other two are gonna try to attack you now baby that you're sitting in front of and guarding the

558
00:40:22,820 --> 00:40:28,500
the thing you could deflect them though right i can deflect one of them if it hits me okay one of

559
00:40:28,500 --> 00:40:34,340
them you deflect sure hope two don't hit me because uh one misses and the other one you easily deflect

560
00:40:34,340 --> 00:40:41,060
okay well i roll to see how much damage i i it uh i can i can deflect 1d 10 plus 7 damage

561
00:40:47,620 --> 00:40:52,740
So that's 10. That's a 10. Yeah, they're not going to be able to do all right, probably not.

562
00:40:52,740 --> 00:41:00,500
It ricochets off my head with a very metal. Yeah, it's your turn now, baby. Okay.

563
00:41:00,500 --> 00:41:09,460
Let me see. I think I guess at this point, I kind of just have to keep guarding the door.

564
00:41:09,460 --> 00:41:16,980
How far away is Wankoff on the ground for me? He's about like probably 40 ish feet.

565
00:41:16,980 --> 00:41:22,180
Alright, and are there robots in range of me that are near him?

566
00:41:22,180 --> 00:41:24,620
Can I just range, can I just do a sling?

567
00:41:24,620 --> 00:41:25,620
Yeah!

568
00:41:25,620 --> 00:41:26,620
Robots?

569
00:41:26,620 --> 00:41:27,620
I'll just attack.

570
00:41:27,620 --> 00:41:28,620
Do it!

571
00:41:28,620 --> 00:41:30,020
Do it at the two that are attacking you, you can do it at.

572
00:41:30,020 --> 00:41:31,020
Alright.

573
00:41:31,020 --> 00:41:32,020
That hits.

574
00:41:32,020 --> 00:41:33,020
Okay.

575
00:41:33,020 --> 00:41:34,020
8 damage.

576
00:41:34,020 --> 00:41:38,460
Oh, well they took damage from that fall, so one of them just like *pshh* just like

577
00:41:38,460 --> 00:41:41,380
you just get it in the cranium and it just blows up.

578
00:41:41,380 --> 00:41:42,380
Sick.

579
00:41:42,380 --> 00:41:43,380
Nice.

580
00:41:43,380 --> 00:41:45,180
Uh, good use.

581
00:41:45,180 --> 00:41:47,180
Now you're up, Waylon, au revoir.

582
00:41:47,180 --> 00:41:49,520
So I've, so these robots coming up behind me,

583
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:50,780
I think we're going faster than me.

584
00:41:50,780 --> 00:41:52,300
So I just sort of like go limp

585
00:41:52,300 --> 00:41:54,940
and just let the momentum carry me forward.

586
00:41:54,940 --> 00:41:57,340
So I'm there, I've made it.

587
00:41:57,340 --> 00:41:58,840
And I'm going to cast,

588
00:41:58,840 --> 00:42:02,420
I'm gonna cast crown of madness on one of them.

589
00:42:02,420 --> 00:42:03,260
Oh shit.

590
00:42:03,260 --> 00:42:07,220
Let me just read what that is.

591
00:42:07,220 --> 00:42:12,820
Okay, so you gotta succeed on a wisdom saving throw

592
00:42:12,820 --> 00:42:16,500
or I can like, one of them goes insane

593
00:42:16,500 --> 00:42:18,220
and start attacking the others.

594
00:42:18,220 --> 00:42:22,020
- Oh yeah, and these robots do have the capacity

595
00:42:22,020 --> 00:42:22,860
to go insane.

596
00:42:22,860 --> 00:42:25,300
So it's gonna be very cool.

597
00:42:25,300 --> 00:42:27,620
Let's see, it's a wisdom saving throw, was it 14, right?

598
00:42:27,620 --> 00:42:28,580
- Yeah, yeah.

599
00:42:28,580 --> 00:42:31,420
- All right, all right, I remembered that.

600
00:42:31,420 --> 00:42:36,420
Okay, they're not the most wise 'cause they're robots.

601
00:42:36,420 --> 00:42:39,500
Yeah, pretty bad.

602
00:42:39,500 --> 00:42:41,420
Yeah, that one goes insane.

603
00:42:41,420 --> 00:42:42,500
What does it do?

604
00:42:42,500 --> 00:42:48,580
Alright so what does it see it yeah okay so it goes insane and it just sees

605
00:42:48,580 --> 00:42:53,980
everyone becomes Waylon everyone around it just becomes Waylon and they're all

606
00:42:53,980 --> 00:42:59,000
just shouting order in the court order in the court order in the court order in

607
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:05,180
the court order in the court and then all of them combine and meld into one Waylon

608
00:43:05,180 --> 00:43:07,820
who's like standing before him and says kill me.

609
00:43:07,820 --> 00:43:13,960
Jesus Christ, put me out of my little boy misery.

610
00:43:13,960 --> 00:43:18,920
Oh my God. OK, OK, cool.

611
00:43:18,920 --> 00:43:22,780
So, yeah, the charm target must use its action before moving in each of its turns

612
00:43:22,780 --> 00:43:25,520
to make a melee attack against a creature other than itself

613
00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:27,320
that you mentally choose.

614
00:43:27,320 --> 00:43:29,720
So it is picking, yeah, any robot near it.

615
00:43:29,720 --> 00:43:31,760
And that's what it will do on its turn.

616
00:43:31,760 --> 00:43:34,060
So I will kill you little lawyer boy.

617
00:43:34,060 --> 00:43:36,940
Um, and you're up now.

618
00:43:36,940 --> 00:43:38,180
Oh, wake off is up.

619
00:43:38,180 --> 00:43:41,140
He's got a roll of death saving throw.

620
00:43:41,140 --> 00:43:44,260
That'd be cool if he died.

621
00:43:44,260 --> 00:43:45,900
He failed.

622
00:43:45,900 --> 00:43:46,900
That's one failure.

623
00:43:46,900 --> 00:43:47,900
Oh, geez.

624
00:43:47,900 --> 00:43:48,900
Okay.

625
00:43:48,900 --> 00:43:54,860
Now you are, you are up now, uh, Caleb.

626
00:43:54,860 --> 00:43:56,220
Um, okay.

627
00:43:56,220 --> 00:44:00,660
I'm going to use mirror image.

628
00:44:00,660 --> 00:44:09,220
you to make, uh, let me see, to make four duplicates of myself.

629
00:44:09,220 --> 00:44:19,700
Yeah. So mirror image is very cool. Your people are not going to be able to tell, um, uh, uh,

630
00:44:19,700 --> 00:44:26,740
what you basically they, if they, they, when they attack, they have to roll, um, uh, you have to roll

631
00:44:26,740 --> 00:44:39,860
is

632
00:44:39,860 --> 00:44:49,140
how you would know that's a trick. Damn. That'd be so cool though. Okay, then it does happen.

633
00:44:49,140 --> 00:44:56,580
And then can I I'm gonna pick up Wank Off with my me me and then all of the all the

634
00:44:56,580 --> 00:45:04,580
other me's I don't can I make them go crazy? So duplicate move with you and mimic your

635
00:45:04,580 --> 00:45:07,780
reactions. Oh, okay. Well, that's fine too. Alright, so it's

636
00:45:07,780 --> 00:45:10,340
really just about dodging it. Uh hit. Okay. So I'm just going

637
00:45:10,340 --> 00:45:13,780
to try to just be line to the the control room then holding.

638
00:45:13,780 --> 00:45:17,620
Okay. Cool. Yeah. Uh you're getting there. They're going to

639
00:45:17,620 --> 00:45:21,620
try to attack you. Uh you must roll six or higher to change

640
00:45:21,620 --> 00:45:24,100
your attacks. I'm rolling eight or higher because I think I

641
00:45:24,100 --> 00:45:27,940
have. Yeah. You have two duplicates. You said you have

642
00:45:27,940 --> 00:45:31,380
four. So, you have three. So, you must roll six or higher.

643
00:45:31,380 --> 00:45:40,300
Okay, so roll roll troll d20 and roll d20 twice more and

644
00:45:40,300 --> 00:45:47,100
16. Yeah, they just attack duplicates. And let's see what

645
00:45:47,100 --> 00:45:52,860
their AC is, though, or rather what their attacks are. Because

646
00:45:52,860 --> 00:45:55,980
they might not even break the duplicates AC.

647
00:45:58,060 --> 00:46:05,060
the

648
00:46:05,060 --> 00:46:24,620
the

649
00:46:24,620 --> 00:46:31,620
this is

650
00:46:31,620 --> 00:46:44,060
the

651
00:46:44,060 --> 00:46:47,340
and he walks around and he's like, "Oh god, I haven't been here in a while."

652
00:46:47,340 --> 00:46:50,460
And he looks around at all the buttons and he turns to you, John Kennedy, and says,

653
00:46:50,460 --> 00:46:51,660
"You pressed all the red buttons yet?"

654
00:46:51,660 --> 00:46:54,380
"Yeah, I pressed all of them!"

655
00:46:54,380 --> 00:46:56,940
"Okay, all right. Good, first step is done."

656
00:46:56,940 --> 00:46:57,660
"Fucking crap."

657
00:46:57,660 --> 00:46:59,980
And he starts going to all the green buttons now.

658
00:46:59,980 --> 00:47:09,740
And you hear *boom* as the boss shut down.

659
00:47:09,740 --> 00:47:20,460
and when you hear *fart* as the shit unclogs and *fart* spills out into the hallway and you see it like

660
00:47:20,460 --> 00:47:25,260
through the the door's window like it's just like coming through like a tsunami like *fart*

661
00:47:25,260 --> 00:47:30,860
you see turd devils flying out from that you see frogs sliding out robots swirling around this

662
00:47:30,860 --> 00:47:37,100
shit. It's not my fault I did not do that. Uh and then... Hey quick question did I make it out of

663
00:47:37,100 --> 00:47:43,700
of the hallway? Yeah, you said you got pushed forward. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Uh,

664
00:47:43,700 --> 00:47:49,180
the control room starts to like the window up on top where you were seeing the **** sort

665
00:47:49,180 --> 00:47:59,560
of pouring in shuts and the control room starts to rumble and you feel it going down and you

666
00:47:59,560 --> 00:48:03,480
you see Wankoff, he's like, "This is, uh, okay."

667
00:48:03,480 --> 00:48:12,240
And you feel it going down, down, down, until it's a bottom of some kind.

668
00:48:12,240 --> 00:48:15,800
And the door you were just looking at opens.

669
00:48:15,800 --> 00:48:19,800
And you see a long, dark cavern.

670
00:48:19,800 --> 00:48:26,040
Like not a basement, not anything, you know, built.

671
00:48:26,040 --> 00:48:34,280
so far down that you're seeing like stone and rock and a long hallway and you hear somebody

672
00:48:34,280 --> 00:48:42,800
say come out my nephew and bring your your lovely children friends and the one who's

673
00:48:42,800 --> 00:48:50,640
not a child and the tree which one's that this is the first moment I haven't been running

674
00:48:50,640 --> 00:48:56,480
for my life in a little bit and so I just scream in pain because I'm just always in so much pain.

675
00:48:56,480 --> 00:49:06,880
Yeah and uh you see Wankoff and he's like "Uncle, Uncle Wally?" and he starts to wander down this

676
00:49:06,880 --> 00:49:13,520
hallway um uh into this dark you see torches are kind of lighting up as he's walking down

677
00:49:14,480 --> 00:49:24,480
Um, and as you guys follow him, you see a large atrium where in you see hanging up

678
00:49:24,480 --> 00:49:32,880
the Wally Wankoff, the one who was, whose figure and form was embossed on the door in the first

679
00:49:32,880 --> 00:49:41,040
episode. And, but you, and so he looks similar to Douglas Tolbraron, aka the Wally Wankoff you guys

680
00:49:41,040 --> 00:49:48,160
no. Except he's, you know, like a normal-sized guy, not that there's anything wrong with being 5'1",

681
00:49:48,160 --> 00:49:57,680
but it's not normal. And, uh, and his, but what's not normal about this one is that his limbs are

682
00:49:57,680 --> 00:50:05,280
stretched out, connecting the four inner tubes that jut out at different points of the cavern,

683
00:50:05,280 --> 00:50:08,960
reaching out to parts of the factory, you presume,

684
00:50:08,960 --> 00:50:14,960
and his head attached to a body that is affixed to a urinal

685
00:50:14,960 --> 00:50:18,960
that has a motherboard lining it. And his head is preserved in some sort of

686
00:50:18,960 --> 00:50:24,640
crystal, it's crystal and candy tesseract. And there's several tubes that jut out

687
00:50:24,640 --> 00:50:28,400
of his back and made of a host of stitched together

688
00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:33,440
flesh. It appears to be pumping inside him literal shit.

689
00:50:33,440 --> 00:50:39,280
Um, and he says to his nephew,

690
00:50:39,280 --> 00:50:44,040
you've been a grave disappointment to me.

691
00:50:44,040 --> 00:50:48,000
And he's like, I didn't know you were alive.

692
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:50,480
You're what happened to you?

693
00:50:50,480 --> 00:50:52,800
Oh, God, you look horrible.

694
00:50:52,800 --> 00:50:56,000
You look like shit.

695
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:58,800
I'm living forever.

696
00:50:58,800 --> 00:51:00,440
What can you say?

697
00:51:00,440 --> 00:51:02,280
Are you going to live forever?

698
00:51:02,280 --> 00:51:04,280
Anti-Disestablishmentarianism.

699
00:51:04,280 --> 00:51:06,520
What?

700
00:51:06,520 --> 00:51:09,680
Do you want me to say that three times fast? What was that?

701
00:51:09,680 --> 00:51:13,580
I said it. You say, you say, "What can you say?" I said, "Anti-Disestablishmentarianism."

702
00:51:13,580 --> 00:51:16,780
You threw down a gauntlet and he picked it right up.

703
00:51:16,780 --> 00:51:18,780
Yep.

704
00:51:18,780 --> 00:51:21,260
You know what? I, you got me.

705
00:51:21,260 --> 00:51:23,260
Yeah, you say it!

706
00:51:23,260 --> 00:51:25,620
Yeah, you say it now.

707
00:51:25,620 --> 00:51:27,620
I draw my rapier, you say it.

708
00:51:27,620 --> 00:51:30,600
Anti-Disestablishmentarianism, was that it?

709
00:51:30,600 --> 00:51:34,580
Not think you messed it up. Yeah, I think you messed up some at some point. Oh

710
00:51:34,580 --> 00:51:39,640
God

711
00:51:39,640 --> 00:51:42,640
You and he looks to you baby. He says oh

712
00:51:42,640 --> 00:51:46,600
I recognize your face. Oh

713
00:51:46,600 --> 00:51:51,720
I sent you to Illinois and turns your beautiful mother into poop

714
00:51:56,520 --> 00:52:03,760
Yes, I had the money from the Dibby family for many years. They're a rich family from Cukichu Wales

715
00:52:03,760 --> 00:52:20,180
That's right your Bibi Dibi

716
00:52:25,800 --> 00:52:33,240
As T should plus your mom's made of shit, that's stupid anyway

717
00:52:33,240 --> 00:52:43,060
Didn't you turn her to shit and you call it it's stupid now

718
00:52:43,060 --> 00:52:51,440
That was your move dude, I was trying to figure out how eternal life worked obviously I was sort of right

719
00:52:51,480 --> 00:52:56,000
She doesn't live on a shit. I guess that makes sense. I'm sorry for saying anything

720
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:59,320
And

721
00:52:59,320 --> 00:53:01,640
You think it looks at his nephew. I

722
00:53:01,640 --> 00:53:04,600
Wanted you to find me an heir

723
00:53:04,600 --> 00:53:09,520
That is what I wanted you to do. Hey, I got there I

724
00:53:09,520 --> 00:53:19,540
Remember this remember hearing this from the outside I see everything in this factory this factory is an extension of my body

725
00:53:19,540 --> 00:53:21,540
*fart*

726
00:53:21,540 --> 00:53:27,420
yes i heard that too i hear the frogs and their obsessive stupid singing

727
00:53:27,420 --> 00:53:31,080
here the robots in their quarterly business reviews

728
00:53:31,080 --> 00:53:32,940
i hear your farts

729
00:53:32,940 --> 00:53:34,540
uh... it is bad

730
00:53:34,540 --> 00:53:37,120
this lawyer child paul

731
00:53:37,120 --> 00:53:38,900
it was bad

732
00:53:38,900 --> 00:53:41,120
uh... job sorry guys

733
00:53:41,120 --> 00:53:44,220
missus shit shooting into his body

734
00:53:44,220 --> 00:53:49,060
it's not coming into my nose

735
00:53:49,060 --> 00:53:50,300
anyway

736
00:53:50,300 --> 00:53:52,300
You were supposed to give me an heir.

737
00:53:52,300 --> 00:53:55,780
And you see Wankoff and he goes, "Well, these are heirs.

738
00:53:55,780 --> 00:53:58,420
I can just adopt them or something."

739
00:53:58,420 --> 00:54:01,340
And he says, "I wanted you to fuck somebody, you idiot.

740
00:54:01,340 --> 00:54:03,660
They need to be blood-related.

741
00:54:03,660 --> 00:54:06,540
Why do you think I brought you into this at all?

742
00:54:06,540 --> 00:54:09,580
I need a host who's blood-related."

743
00:54:09,580 --> 00:54:12,620
And he says, "How was I going to fuck somebody if I couldn't leave?

744
00:54:12,620 --> 00:54:15,420
I don't know, get a whore.

745
00:54:15,420 --> 00:54:16,780
You know, get a whore.

746
00:54:16,780 --> 00:54:18,620
You could just get a whore.

747
00:54:18,620 --> 00:54:20,240
You're rich.

748
00:54:20,240 --> 00:54:23,920
I'm not a whore. I don't- it's really easy. Why didn't you just do that?

749
00:54:23,920 --> 00:54:31,280
I- I didn't- no, I don't- I don't know. I didn't- oh my god. Anyway.

750
00:54:31,280 --> 00:54:37,680
I'm sorry, all this talk of heirs and producing heirs and fucking- I'm only seven years old! What are you talking about?

751
00:54:37,680 --> 00:54:39,680
*laughter*

752
00:54:39,680 --> 00:54:41,680
*sniff*

753
00:54:41,680 --> 00:54:43,680
*sniff*

754
00:54:43,680 --> 00:54:45,680
Oh, you're seven.

755
00:54:45,680 --> 00:54:51,560
teach you what I actually that's a that's a mission for your dad or something I

756
00:54:51,560 --> 00:54:59,040
don't know well I think I had a dream I killed my dad we've all have we've all

757
00:54:59,040 --> 00:55:06,720

758
00:55:07,720 --> 00:55:18,820

759
00:55:18,820 --> 00:55:25,800
put just standing there was shitting your back come closer and I and you do

760
00:55:25,800 --> 00:55:35,360
yeah you come closer and a centrifuge opens up from the ground and you start

761
00:55:35,360 --> 00:55:44,120
spinning inside of it and wank off his soul leaves his body and enters the

762
00:55:44,120 --> 00:55:50,000
centrifuge and he says this is an interim step I will possess someone of

763
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:54,720
my blood I need I'm going to need more shit in my body though to stay alive and

764
00:55:54,720 --> 00:55:59,200
he spins with you in the centrifuge until you know he's putting dookie in his body

765
00:55:59,200 --> 00:56:12,680
the

766
00:56:12,680 --> 00:56:22,680
the

767
00:56:22,680 --> 00:56:25,680
And you have to fight your friends.

768
00:56:25,680 --> 00:56:29,680
But I love my friends. This is bullshit.

769
00:56:29,680 --> 00:56:38,680
These are the third through seventh people I've ever met.

770
00:56:38,680 --> 00:56:43,680
Roll for initiative everyone.

771
00:56:43,680 --> 00:56:46,680
Do we get to heal at all before?

772
00:56:46,680 --> 00:56:47,680
Oh no.

773
00:56:47,680 --> 00:56:49,680
Let me tell you what boys, I have 5 HP.

774
00:56:49,680 --> 00:56:53,680
I think you're going to have a good time killing me.

775
00:56:53,680 --> 00:56:56,680
Oh, I did get a nat 20 initiative.

776
00:56:56,680 --> 00:56:58,680
Oh, I got an 18.

777
00:56:58,680 --> 00:57:00,680
OK, and Waylon?

778
00:57:00,680 --> 00:57:02,680
Oh, sorry, I got an 18 too.

779
00:57:02,680 --> 00:57:03,680
What?

780
00:57:03,680 --> 00:57:05,680
Whose dex is higher? Cam's, yours, right?

781
00:57:05,680 --> 00:57:07,680
Mine's plus four.

782
00:57:07,680 --> 00:57:08,680
Yeah, OK, yours is higher.

783
00:57:08,680 --> 00:57:11,680
OK, so you're going to go before him.

784
00:57:11,680 --> 00:57:13,680
Oh, boy.

785
00:57:13,680 --> 00:57:18,680
And yeah, you, your pain has stopped, though.

786
00:57:18,680 --> 00:57:25,160
though. You feel whole, having a soul inside of you, a soul you did not have before, Redwood Fox.

787
00:57:25,160 --> 00:57:34,840
But it is controlling you against your will. As you are, your branches continue to grow and gnarl.

788
00:57:34,840 --> 00:57:44,280
As your body starts to shift and as tubes fly into your back, start pumping shit inside of you.

789
00:57:46,200 --> 00:57:52,520
but you don't feel the same kind of like dark twisted pain that you were feeling constantly

790
00:57:52,520 --> 00:57:58,360
as a fucked up puppet boy. Your pain, he did keep true to his word, your pain did stop.

791
00:57:58,360 --> 00:58:06,120
And it is your turn. Okay, can you have you have your move set, but you also have

792
00:58:06,120 --> 00:58:09,960
additional moves. Okay, do I still have five HP?

793
00:58:11,800 --> 00:58:17,000
You have 10 HP now. Whoa. Whoa. Mm hmm. Gonna be pretty tough boys.

794
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:21,000
Mm hmm. This is it might be unfair. Your AC is also now

795
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:27,800
sixteen. Okay. So, it's no longer ten. Uh you have a

796
00:58:27,800 --> 00:58:32,200
couple of abilities. One you have is ship beam. So, you can

797
00:58:32,200 --> 00:58:39,000
shoot a line of **** out of your hollow. Um that does 1D12

798
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:46,080
damage and also poisons enemies. You also have from your branches now hanging much like

799
00:58:46,080 --> 00:58:52,700
a Christmas tree candy cane men. That you can basically use an action to summon and

800
00:58:52,700 --> 00:58:59,900
have them fight your friends. I'm a Christmas tree. You just happen to have candy on you.

801
00:58:59,900 --> 00:59:05,620
It's part of the Wank off thing. Okay. Can my my branches be can I kind of want to have

802
00:59:05,620 --> 00:59:13,860
kind of a third evolution here. Yeah. I can my branches grow kind of so far out and and

803
00:59:13,860 --> 00:59:17,780
kind of wrap around each other to the point where I'm kind of like a big tumbleweed with

804
00:59:17,780 --> 00:59:24,400
like a cartoon face on it. I love it. Let's do it. Yeah, you do that and then with as

805
00:59:24,400 --> 00:59:30,060
a tumbleweed. Yeah, do you want to have like a Katamari Dimash style attack? It kind of

806
00:59:30,060 --> 00:59:33,120
works with something else. I would probably actually have less attacks as a tumbleweed

807
00:59:33,120 --> 00:59:47,640
in

808
00:59:47,640 --> 00:59:51,340
Canine the Lingvall Foxworthy

809
00:59:51,340 --> 01:00:03,920
I

810
01:00:03,920 --> 01:00:09,120
Reckon I'm about to become a tumbleweed. That's what I say right before I become the tumbleweed

811
01:00:09,120 --> 01:00:14,480
Yeah, well, I reckon I became a tumbleweed. Mm-hmm

812
01:00:14,840 --> 01:00:19,040
You might be a tumbleweed you might be a tumbleweed if you're me

813
01:00:19,040 --> 01:00:23,960
So you're also gonna have a tumbleweed attack

814
01:00:23,960 --> 01:00:34,280
You might be a tumbleweed if

815
01:00:34,280 --> 01:00:39,160
Roll him over to death

816
01:00:39,160 --> 01:00:44,080
That's I was gonna say you have an attack where they have to roll a deck saving throw

817
01:00:44,080 --> 01:00:52,920
against a DC of 13 or they take some damage. If you go in between two men

818
01:00:52,920 --> 01:01:01,760
about to have a duel... What? What? If you roll in between two men about to have a duel...

819
01:01:01,760 --> 01:01:06,920
You might be a tumbleweed. Oh, okay. Alright. Right. So that would be good if you were the tumbleweed.

820
01:01:06,920 --> 01:01:10,880
If your character was a tumbleweed you might be able to say that. Yeah, but I had that in the back

821
01:01:10,880 --> 01:01:16,080
pocket I was waiting all day you yeah that was at the very bottom of the back pocket

822
01:01:16,080 --> 01:01:17,880
you were digging through like like inches of worms

823
01:01:17,880 --> 01:01:18,880
but you're not a tumbleweed

824
01:01:18,880 --> 01:01:20,880
I was so relieved when he turned into a tumbleweed

825
01:01:20,880 --> 01:01:26,600
all right cool you're up though man

826
01:01:26,600 --> 01:01:29,840
me yeah I'm gonna use my tumbleweed ability

827
01:01:29,840 --> 01:01:30,840
hell yeah

828
01:01:30,840 --> 01:01:31,840
John Candy

829
01:01:31,840 --> 01:01:33,120
you can use it on all of them at once

830
01:01:33,120 --> 01:01:35,120
okay I'm gonna use it on all of them

831
01:01:35,120 --> 01:01:39,320
everyone roll a dexterity saving throw

832
01:01:39,320 --> 01:01:56,640
this is

833
01:01:56,640 --> 01:02:03,640
we'd blow over Waylon and it says split right? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Cool. You take six. Like

834
01:02:03,640 --> 01:02:11,840
a low poly 3D animation. Yeah. Yeah. You take six damage from that Waylon. Woo! Probably

835
01:02:11,840 --> 01:02:16,760
not looking too hot. Yeah I'm at three hit point. That's right. Uh and you can attack

836
01:02:16,760 --> 01:02:22,640
one more time too. Oh shit. Yeah dude. I can I just run it back and just kinda kinda. Yes

837
01:02:22,640 --> 01:02:40,600
to

838
01:02:40,600 --> 01:02:42,600
going back and forth every turn.

839
01:02:42,600 --> 01:02:46,600
Okay, I got a 20.

840
01:02:46,600 --> 01:02:50,600
Alright, so John Candy, you take 6 damage.

841
01:02:50,600 --> 01:02:52,600
Okay.

842
01:02:52,600 --> 01:02:54,600
What are you at? 4.

843
01:02:54,600 --> 01:02:56,600
Hell yeah.

844
01:02:56,600 --> 01:02:58,600
You are now up

845
01:02:58,600 --> 01:03:00,600
Bibby Dibby.

846
01:03:00,600 --> 01:03:02,600
Full name.

847
01:03:02,600 --> 01:03:04,600
Yeah, so I get, I do double damage

848
01:03:04,600 --> 01:03:06,600
because I know my full name.

849
01:03:06,600 --> 01:03:08,600
I'm gonna use my

850
01:03:08,600 --> 01:03:15,700
Am I melee range I get a melee range and I swing my crushes at my former friend. I'm crying

851
01:03:15,700 --> 01:03:18,200
I'm sobbing my first friend in the world

852
01:03:18,200 --> 01:03:22,900
You rolled over us. I don't know what I'm doing. Yeah, he has no

853
01:03:22,900 --> 01:03:30,980
Chocolate monster. Well, I don't know that he doesn't know what he's doing. So I hate him. This is dramatic irony at its finest

854
01:03:30,980 --> 01:03:37,040
Yeah, go for him. All right, that's a 20 shit. My dad only 16, right?

855
01:03:37,040 --> 01:03:39,840
Yeah, 11 damage. Yeah, he's dead.

856
01:03:39,840 --> 01:03:43,040
[Laughter]

857
01:03:43,040 --> 01:03:45,440
You might be a tumbleweed if...

858
01:03:45,440 --> 01:03:47,840
[Groans]

859
01:03:47,840 --> 01:03:49,840
[Sighs]

860
01:03:49,840 --> 01:03:51,840
Describe how you kill him.

861
01:03:51,840 --> 01:03:57,440
Can I say, okay, I swing my crutch and I connect with one of the branches of the tumbleweed.

862
01:03:57,440 --> 01:03:59,440
Since they used to be branches, they're brittle and hard.

863
01:03:59,440 --> 01:04:03,440
And one of them breaks away and it starts this like, this domino effect

864
01:04:03,440 --> 01:04:09,720
if they all start cracking and breaking and flying off, and at the center, it's Pinocchio.

865
01:04:09,720 --> 01:04:13,280
It's little baby Pinocchio without a nose at all.

866
01:04:13,280 --> 01:04:15,580
No nose?

867
01:04:15,580 --> 01:04:16,580
And he's lying on the ground.

868
01:04:16,580 --> 01:04:17,580
Hey everybody!

869
01:04:17,580 --> 01:04:20,580
Well if he's lying his nose is gonna grow.

870
01:04:20,580 --> 01:04:22,720
Oh no I'm dead!

871
01:04:22,720 --> 01:04:27,280
I would say you could try to bring Pinocchio back to life.

872
01:04:27,280 --> 01:04:30,080
I can't, I don't have anything I can do that with.

873
01:04:30,080 --> 01:04:35,480
I mean, I can use, I guess I can do a, I mean, I don't have any healing items or anything.

874
01:04:35,480 --> 01:04:39,920
Can I cast Dissonant Whispers to try to bring him back to life?

875
01:04:39,920 --> 01:04:40,920
You know what?

876
01:04:40,920 --> 01:04:42,640
We're playing insanely fast and loose.

877
01:04:42,640 --> 01:04:43,640
Let's do it.

878
01:04:43,640 --> 01:04:44,640
Oh, great.

879
01:04:44,640 --> 01:04:47,280
Yeah, that was a joke, but sure.

880
01:04:47,280 --> 01:04:50,280
No, no, I want to do it.

881
01:04:50,280 --> 01:04:51,280
I think you have to, you have to.

882
01:04:51,280 --> 01:04:52,280
What is Dissonant Whispers?

883
01:04:52,280 --> 01:04:53,280
So, well, okay, so Dissonant Whispers does damage.

884
01:04:53,280 --> 01:04:54,280
Yeah, explain it to me.

885
01:04:54,280 --> 01:04:55,280
Yes.

886
01:04:55,280 --> 01:04:56,280
It's related to me, yes.

887
01:04:56,280 --> 01:05:03,280
So, and it does 3d6 damage, and so what I'll do is resonant whispers, which does 3d6 healing.

888
01:05:03,280 --> 01:05:04,280
Yeah.

889
01:05:04,280 --> 01:05:06,760
But I'm at -1 HP.

890
01:05:06,760 --> 01:05:07,760
Does that matter?

891
01:05:07,760 --> 01:05:08,760
No.

892
01:05:08,760 --> 01:05:09,760
Okay.

893
01:05:09,760 --> 01:05:16,360
I would say, before you do that, let's, let's, okay, here's what we can do.

894
01:05:16,360 --> 01:05:17,360
Okay.

895
01:05:17,360 --> 01:05:20,480
Because it is, I'm playing too fast and too loose now.

896
01:05:20,480 --> 01:05:25,300
Let's make it a little bit tighter.

897
01:05:25,300 --> 01:05:28,440
You can try to do this and it whispers.

898
01:05:28,440 --> 01:05:35,160
And if you get higher than 10, you'll roll a straight d20, if you get higher than 10

899
01:05:35,160 --> 01:05:36,160
it heals.

900
01:05:36,160 --> 01:05:40,520
Lower than 10 it doesn't heal.

901
01:05:40,520 --> 01:05:46,180
And as we all know, looking at Pinocchio's original HP, which we're going to base it

902
01:05:46,180 --> 01:05:53,140
off of instead of Redwood Fox and Red Fox would Fox were here 17 yeah if he gets

903
01:05:53,140 --> 01:05:59,060
negative the that HP he he's permanently dead so that can be the risk factor here

904
01:05:59,060 --> 01:06:04,900
okay if you want to do that let's do I mean this seems like I could just kill

905
01:06:04,900 --> 01:06:11,100
him right now in one move by accident so but I'm already doesn't exist yeah with

906
01:06:11,100 --> 01:06:25,060
the

907
01:06:25,060 --> 01:06:28,420
he doesn't have a mouth. I forgot. Well, can I put it up his puppet hole?

908
01:06:28,420 --> 01:06:32,580
Oh, he's a wooden puppet.

909
01:06:32,580 --> 01:06:36,300
If you dare, can I make a hole in him?

910
01:06:36,300 --> 01:06:40,220
You want to, so you want to, maybe he's like, look, there's a puppet hole.

911
01:06:40,220 --> 01:06:46,300
That's weird. So you want to create a hole. I'm going to, okay.

912
01:06:46,300 --> 01:06:49,580
If I can get some candy, I'm going to put it in the hole where his nose used to

913
01:06:49,580 --> 01:06:50,420
be.

914
01:06:52,460 --> 01:06:55,340
if there's candy nearby, is there candy that I can...

915
01:06:55,340 --> 01:07:00,140
There is chocolate, there is chocolate nearby, it is mixed with shit.

916
01:07:00,140 --> 01:07:05,340
I mean I'm going for it, I can't tell the difference, I think it's the chocolate.

917
01:07:05,340 --> 01:07:06,280
Yeah.

918
01:07:06,280 --> 01:07:10,700
And we'll, we'll roll, we'll do the same thing, let's roll d20.

919
01:07:10,700 --> 01:07:11,840
Okay.

920
01:07:11,840 --> 01:07:15,420
Higher than 10 it's chocolate, lower than 10 it's shit.

921
01:07:15,420 --> 01:07:19,020
But it's only gonna do so much damage.

922
01:07:19,020 --> 01:07:21,900
And shit heals Caleb double because he loves eating it so much.

923
01:07:21,900 --> 01:07:25,400
No, no, no.

924
01:07:25,400 --> 01:07:32,400
Okay, Pinocchio, you're breathed back with whatever life you had.

925
01:07:32,400 --> 01:07:34,400
Friends.

926
01:07:34,400 --> 01:07:36,400
What?

927
01:07:36,400 --> 01:07:38,400
What?

928
01:07:38,400 --> 01:07:42,400
Where did this guy come from?

929
01:07:42,400 --> 01:07:46,400
I was here a couple hours ago. You don't remember me?

930
01:07:46,400 --> 01:07:48,400
No.

931
01:07:48,400 --> 01:08:02,700
it baby gives Pinocchio a big hug oh oh and breaks my arms and you see a wink

932
01:08:02,700 --> 01:08:09,520
off and he says all right I did not expect to kill my uncle or for him to

933
01:08:09,520 --> 01:08:14,480
say such mean things to me I'm done with this factory I think I could probably

934
01:08:14,480 --> 01:08:29,160
of

935
01:08:29,160 --> 01:08:30,160
Yeah!

936
01:08:30,160 --> 01:08:31,160
Let's go!

937
01:08:31,160 --> 01:08:34,160
I don't know why I was gonna give it to a kid.

938
01:08:34,160 --> 01:08:39,160
Like the more I think about it, the crazier it seems.

939
01:08:39,160 --> 01:08:40,160
Yeah!

940
01:08:40,160 --> 01:08:42,160
Fuck yeah!

941
01:08:42,160 --> 01:08:43,160
Woo!

942
01:08:43,160 --> 01:08:46,920
Um, what, we're in the control room, right?

943
01:08:46,920 --> 01:08:49,160
You're in like some sort of fucked up cryptic basement.

944
01:08:49,160 --> 01:08:52,160
Yeah, alright, so I'm like running around the room.

945
01:08:52,160 --> 01:08:53,160
Yeah.

946
01:08:53,160 --> 01:08:55,160
And I'm like, let's fucking go!

947
01:08:55,160 --> 01:08:56,160
Let's go!

948
01:08:56,160 --> 01:09:03,160
and i don't realize there's like a cliff

949
01:09:03,160 --> 01:09:11,320
i'm doing i'd do a cartwheel perfect off the cliff

950
01:09:11,320 --> 01:09:18,960
but in the in the bottom of the pit

951
01:09:18,960 --> 01:09:22,680
that i do the cartwheel it's not a it's not even a tall pit

952
01:09:22,680 --> 01:09:25,880
it's like six feet deep but

953
01:09:25,880 --> 01:09:32,880
spike trap from tony hawks first

954
01:09:32,880 --> 01:09:40,180
uh... so instead

955
01:09:40,180 --> 01:09:45,400
i guess the vengeful spirit of his nephew

956
01:09:45,400 --> 01:09:49,040
possessed and what's it for all

957
01:09:49,040 --> 01:09:52,360
uh...

958
01:09:52,360 --> 01:09:55,360
the guy i mean do you either of you wanna

959
01:09:55,360 --> 01:09:57,160
I need the three of you.

960
01:09:57,160 --> 01:09:58,000
Do you guys want it?

961
01:09:58,000 --> 01:09:59,500
I don't, I really don't want it.

962
01:09:59,500 --> 01:10:00,340
I trust you guys.

963
01:10:00,340 --> 01:10:01,860
You guys got me here this far.

964
01:10:01,860 --> 01:10:05,360
- Yeah, I'll take it.

965
01:10:05,360 --> 01:10:06,320
I'd love it.

966
01:10:06,320 --> 01:10:09,960
- Yeah, I think you would be the most obvious.

967
01:10:09,960 --> 01:10:11,360
- Do you mean it?

968
01:10:11,360 --> 01:10:12,200
- Yeah, I mean, yeah.

969
01:10:12,200 --> 01:10:13,440
- Oh, woo-hoo, woo-hoo!

970
01:10:13,440 --> 01:10:15,120
And I'll run around the room,

971
01:10:15,120 --> 01:10:17,800
and I'm gonna do a cartwheel as well.

972
01:10:17,800 --> 01:10:20,040
(laughing)

973
01:10:20,040 --> 01:10:20,880
Spike pit.

974
01:10:20,880 --> 01:10:23,040
- Okay, that was a--

975
01:10:23,040 --> 01:10:25,040
He lands on top of me

976
01:10:25,040 --> 01:10:29,620
I'm like at the bottom of the spike about to say like

977
01:10:29,620 --> 01:10:38,080
And like all brain function stops, I'm completely dead

978
01:10:38,080 --> 01:10:42,180
Okay, so there's a wooden boy

979
01:10:42,180 --> 01:10:48,880
Bibby do you want to like go to your mom? I I don't really want anyone to take over this factory anymore

980
01:10:48,880 --> 01:10:50,600
It seems to be a common

981
01:10:50,600 --> 01:10:54,420
Thing happening here. Maybe the robot could just brought it. This is a

982
01:10:54,420 --> 01:11:02,280
Nightmare now with my with my mission being over the only reason I existed in the first place. I

983
01:11:02,280 --> 01:11:04,880
Finally turned into a real boy

984
01:11:04,880 --> 01:11:09,480
Just my hands pop from wood to flesh my eyes

985
01:11:09,480 --> 01:11:12,040
Does it hurt?

986
01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:22,600
Oh my god, I'm a real boy. I have fingers. I have thoughts.

987
01:11:22,600 --> 01:11:24,460
Yay!

988
01:11:24,460 --> 01:11:27,400
And I run around the room.

989
01:11:27,400 --> 01:11:34,360
And I do a cartwheel. My first one ever.

990
01:11:34,360 --> 01:11:38,840
And I also land on the spike.

991
01:11:38,840 --> 01:11:39,000
Okay.

992
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:42,680
The same spike. We're kind of stacked. You know that children's toy that's all the

993
01:11:42,680 --> 01:11:45,320
circles stacked on top of each other?

994
01:11:45,320 --> 01:11:46,600
The murder toy.

995
01:11:46,600 --> 01:11:49,240
Yeah, exactly. We're kind of doing that. Yeah.

996
01:11:49,240 --> 01:11:55,320
Yeah. Well, I'm smarter than them. And also I physically can't do a cartwheel because

997
01:11:55,320 --> 01:12:01,720
both my arms and legs are broken now. So I am, I walk over, we came down in like an

998
01:12:01,720 --> 01:12:03,720
elevator type thing, right? Yeah.

999
01:12:03,720 --> 01:12:05,720
The control room was like an elevator. Oh yeah.

1000
01:12:05,720 --> 01:12:09,800
So I walk over, I'm ready to leave. I'm ready to go. I finally discovered I have a family.

1001
01:12:09,800 --> 01:12:15,240
I have a last name. I'm so happy. I press the elevator button, the doors open and a train

1002
01:12:15,240 --> 01:12:17,240
speeds out

1003
01:12:17,240 --> 01:12:35,240
it's a train from the dream world

1004
01:12:35,240 --> 01:12:43,880
you see there you see the the control panel there was an up button and a down button i accidentally

1005
01:12:43,880 --> 01:12:58,520
press the train button. Oh fuck. Oh god, okay. We're gonna flash forward in the future a

1006
01:12:58,520 --> 01:13:07,680
little bit. Everyone who went to the factory is dead. Wally Wankoff changed his name back

1007
01:13:07,680 --> 01:13:16,760
to Douglas Tolberone. And he's now working at Best Buy again. He's still talking about

1008
01:13:16,760 --> 01:13:27,360
going into computers, happily helping people. His father comes in one day and embraces him.

1009
01:13:27,360 --> 01:13:34,320
They have a tearful reunion. And he gets a great deal on a Vizio 65-inch television,

1010
01:13:34,320 --> 01:13:39,920
Believe it or not, ultra wide 4K.

1011
01:13:39,920 --> 01:13:40,920
That's pretty good.

1012
01:13:40,920 --> 01:13:44,760
We go to the factory now.

1013
01:13:44,760 --> 01:13:47,320
The robots are just going to run it.

1014
01:13:47,320 --> 01:13:52,720
That CEO bot just keeps running it, working with everyone.

1015
01:13:52,720 --> 01:14:01,760
The frogs have found a way to escape the factory's clutches.

1016
01:14:01,760 --> 01:14:04,940
Where they've gone, nobody knows.

1017
01:14:04,940 --> 01:14:09,920
But they have somehow gotten out of this kind of a weird indentured servitude/slavery that

1018
01:14:09,920 --> 01:14:13,920
the frogs were under.

1019
01:14:13,920 --> 01:14:16,120
And I guess you're all dead.

1020
01:14:16,120 --> 01:14:20,280
So there's a lot of different things I was gonna say.

1021
01:14:20,280 --> 01:14:25,520
And it's all gone.

1022
01:14:25,520 --> 01:14:29,920
Maybe all the things that you were gonna say could apply to like our identical twins that

1023
01:14:29,920 --> 01:14:36,720
are still alive. Yeah, sure. You just play like sad piano music as you just say what you would have said.

1024
01:14:36,720 --> 01:14:44,560
Yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah. In black and white. Yeah. Bibby, you reunite with your mother,

1025
01:14:44,560 --> 01:14:51,440
Lady Dibby, and you inherit the wealth of the Dibby family and you move back to Wales.

1026
01:14:55,920 --> 01:14:57,920
I'm still hit by a train.

1027
01:14:57,920 --> 01:15:03,920
Waylon Au Revoir, you find a frog injured on the ground and he says,

1028
01:15:03,920 --> 01:15:11,920
"If only some attorney were around to take our case and make a ton of money off this obvious grounds for class action lawsuit."

1029
01:15:11,920 --> 01:15:20,920
And you take the case and you make more money than any lawyer ever, making you very special indeed.

1030
01:15:20,920 --> 01:15:22,920
[laughter]

1031
01:15:22,920 --> 01:15:23,920
Wow.

1032
01:15:23,920 --> 01:15:27,320
John Candy, you get to run the factory.

1033
01:15:27,320 --> 01:15:31,320
Um, I was gonna let you decide what that meant.

1034
01:15:31,320 --> 01:15:34,320
So what does that mean? What word of that meant?

1035
01:15:34,320 --> 01:15:38,820
If you didn't cannon, cannon die in the game.

1036
01:15:38,820 --> 01:15:44,320
Six months in, that whole operation, shut down.

1037
01:15:44,320 --> 01:15:50,320
Class act, like, like, like, file for bankruptcy almost immediately after.

1038
01:15:50,320 --> 01:16:01,840
I'm like in charge because I got so bored running it that I wanted to do something else.

1039
01:16:01,840 --> 01:16:03,520
I love that idea.

1040
01:16:03,520 --> 01:16:08,560
This is helpful for the modern world setting of the Gunsidney lore.

1041
01:16:08,560 --> 01:16:12,760
Pinocchio, I wrote, "Do what you want, man.

1042
01:16:12,760 --> 01:16:13,760
You asked a tree."

1043
01:16:13,760 --> 01:16:18,080
But you didn't end up being a tree.

1044
01:16:18,080 --> 01:16:26,340
So if Pinocchio didn't cartwheel off and fall into a spike pit, what would he have done?

1045
01:16:26,340 --> 01:16:30,780
If I had never, well I wasn't planning on becoming Pinocchio until Cam turned me into

1046
01:16:30,780 --> 01:16:32,120
Pinocchio.

1047
01:16:32,120 --> 01:16:41,040
My plan was to go just become a normal tree and lose all sentience and just kind of sit

1048
01:16:41,040 --> 01:16:43,320
there for the rest of my days.

1049
01:16:43,320 --> 01:16:44,320
And a young techie.

1050
01:16:44,320 --> 01:16:49,040
I only experience violence in my short life.

1051
01:16:49,040 --> 01:16:54,800
And I'd like to think that the Pinocchio that I created on this D&D campaign is a pretty

1052
01:16:54,800 --> 01:16:59,280
solid abortion metaphor.

1053
01:16:59,280 --> 01:17:00,280
You know, I'm gonna go.

1054
01:17:00,280 --> 01:17:01,280
Yeah.

1055
01:17:01,280 --> 01:17:02,280
That's right.

1056
01:17:02,280 --> 01:17:06,280
That's how I'm gonna go.

1057
01:17:06,280 --> 01:17:12,920
I gave you the warlock pack of the chain and you killed your familiar the second he appeared.

1058
01:17:12,920 --> 01:17:16,360
it was Jiminy Cricket. And then you never summoned it back.

1059
01:17:16,360 --> 01:17:22,360
I don't know how to do that crap. I'm just a simple man.

1060
01:17:22,360 --> 01:17:27,160
Yeah it was rocked. And yeah I guess that was, I mean unless there

1061
01:17:27,160 --> 01:17:32,200
was any other endings you guys would have wanted for your characters.

1062
01:17:32,200 --> 01:17:37,360
The rest of it, I mean. Okay fine, Pinocchio is a, Pinocchio is a celebrity,

1063
01:17:37,360 --> 01:17:42,240
he's at the 40/40 club fingering women with his nose.

1064
01:17:42,240 --> 01:17:43,520
I don't want you to say anything!

1065
01:17:43,520 --> 01:17:49,060
He's doing the "lie to me" joke about Pinocchio, but in real life.

1066
01:17:49,060 --> 01:17:54,800
We see another black and white vignette, and it's of little Chucky Fuckit who died immediately.

1067
01:17:54,800 --> 01:17:59,840
Yeah, it turns out he would have grown up to be the next Hitler, so it's really...

1068
01:17:59,840 --> 01:18:00,840
Wow!

1069
01:18:00,840 --> 01:18:02,800
He died when he did it!

1070
01:18:02,800 --> 01:18:04,520
Did you see "Check my Notes"?

1071
01:18:04,520 --> 01:18:06,520
How did you know that?

1072
01:18:06,520 --> 01:18:07,520
Yeah.

1073
01:18:07,520 --> 01:18:08,520
Alright.

1074
01:18:08,520 --> 01:18:11,880
Yeah, I feel good about this.

1075
01:18:11,880 --> 01:18:12,880
We're done.

1076
01:18:12,880 --> 01:18:13,880
Great, yeah.

1077
01:18:13,880 --> 01:18:14,880
Bye everybody.

1078
01:18:14,880 --> 01:18:15,880
Bye.

1079
01:18:15,880 --> 01:18:15,880
I can also, you know, um, yeah.

1080
01:18:15,880 --> 01:18:24,280
Great yeah. Bye everybody. Bye. I can uh, uh, also you know um, yeah.

1081
01:18:24,280 --> 01:18:36,980
[Music]
