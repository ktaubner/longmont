1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,580
(upbeat music)

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:09,800
- Put it down.

3
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:10,640
- Put that thing down.

4
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:11,460
- Put the knight like that.

5
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:12,300
- Why are you holding it?

6
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:13,140
- You're gonna break it.

7
00:00:13,140 --> 00:00:13,960
- That's supposed to be on the table.

8
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:14,800
- You were gonna break it.

9
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:17,620
- That doesn't make sense if you're, just put it down.

10
00:00:17,620 --> 00:00:19,600
- I'm supposed to put that down.

11
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:20,440
- Put that down.

12
00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:21,260
- Whatever.

13
00:00:21,260 --> 00:00:22,720
- You guys are already ruining the sleepover?

14
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:24,400
- I am not ruining it at all.

15
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:25,240
- No, if anyone was ruining it,

16
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:26,800
it was just you holding that up in the air.

17
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:27,680
- If anyone was ruining it,

18
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:31,440
It was this guy who thinks that a mascot costume is pajamas.

19
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:32,200
It's not.

20
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:33,320
It's my pajamas.

21
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:34,280
Those look cozy.

22
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:35,600
And they are cozy.

23
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:36,680
Those look really--

24
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:39,000
It is a little hard to get up and pee in these

25
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,120
in the middle of the night.

26
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:42,360
Well, luckily for you, we're not

27
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:44,960
going to be having to get up and pee in the middle of the night

28
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:48,480
resting up all the way till motherfucking midnight tonight.

29
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:50,720
Motherfucking midnight o'clock.

30
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:52,320
The witching hour.

31
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:53,840
Julio, what time is it right now?

32
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:55,360
Can we get a time check really quick?

33
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:55,860
7 PM.

34
00:00:55,860 --> 00:00:57,240
7 PM, baby.

35
00:00:57,240 --> 00:01:00,040
That's right. We're staying all the way up till midnight tonight.

36
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:02,200
All night long. What do you guys want to do?

37
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:04,800
Living up to midnight.

38
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:05,400
Oh, that's good.

39
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:07,840
Sleeping after that.

40
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:08,840
Damn.

41
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:14,240
Living up to midnight with a cat.

42
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:16,440
Because you wear a cat outfit.

43
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:19,240
Is this going to be the latest that either of you have ever stayed up?

44
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:20,920
No, I stayed up till eight in the morning.

45
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:21,600
Yeah.

46
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:25,160
I stayed up till 2 a.m. at 3.

47
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:26,240
I was doing drugs.

48
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:28,400
What the hell, you're doing drugs at our age, man?

49
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:30,360
I was doing a lot of drugs.

50
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:31,520
Bro, we're in eighth grade.

51
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:32,360
I know, I'm the bad kid.

52
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:33,880
What the hell are you talking about?

53
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:34,720
Damn.

54
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:38,920
Uh-huh, I was doing drugs like sticky note.

55
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:42,240
No way, don't tell me you did toothpaste.

56
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:43,760
I did, you know what I did?

57
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:44,600
What?

58
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:46,360
I put a sticky note up here and then immediately after

59
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:48,680
'cause that, I mean, my tolerance is so high.

60
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:51,200
What?

61
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:54,280
What, dude, it's a slumber party.

62
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:56,120
Have you guys tried deodorant yet?

63
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:58,720
It's fucking awesome dude, check this out.

64
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:02,920
My mom said I have to wear that stuff?

65
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:04,720
I'm seriously gonna fucking get kissed now.

66
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:05,720
I don't fuck with it.

67
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:06,720
Try it dude, hit this.

68
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:07,720
No dude.

69
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:08,720
Oww!

70
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:09,720
You hurt our friend!

71
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:10,720
Jubio!

72
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:11,720
It's not that big of a deal.

73
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:12,720
You crip.

74
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:13,720
Jubio!

75
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:14,720
It's just a can of deodorant.

76
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:15,720
It's only 7pm and you're already like...

77
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:17,720
Oh my god, wait, wait, I just noticed these.

78
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:19,720
Cameron, show everybody your slippers.

79
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:21,720
Oh yeah, wait, we do have to have a little bit of a pajama check.

80
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:24,720
Yeah, my tolerance is so high though I smoked banana peels

81
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:26,760
to answer your question before I was interrupted.

82
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:27,920
- You actually did. - Holy crap.

83
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:31,320
- I smoked a banana peel and I got--

84
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:33,320
- So you got the Bruins PJs on.

85
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:35,640
- Bruins pajamas, but what I'm looking at here

86
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:37,240
are these amazing slippers.

87
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:38,440
- Kind of Chinese style slippers.

88
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:39,440
- They're Chinese.

89
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:41,100
- Now show us that T-shirt, boy.

90
00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:42,540
- Yeah.

91
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:44,400
- I tested positive for Swag 19.

92
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:45,320
Where'd you get that?

93
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:47,840
- My mom bought it for me for school, back to school.

94
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:48,840
- Mad ass.

95
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:51,000
- I'm gonna smell like this all day.

96
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:51,840
- Smell like what?

97
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:53,520
Fucking adulthood? - I'm gonna smell like Agus.

98
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:58,320
where's my secrets by the end of the night

99
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:00,820
i have a what do you guys think girls like

100
00:03:00,820 --> 00:03:02,840
uh... they select with the

101
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:06,840
like so i think we'll see what what what what what what what what what what what

102
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:09,560

00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:16,480

105
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:17,200
on

106
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:22,200
it's not a shot is that it not it i have a uh... to some of what can

107
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:24,280
gay ass shit that I don't even fucking agree with.

108
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:25,880
- Oh, I bet you jizz on that too.

109
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:27,560
- I jizz just to jizz it.

110
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:30,520
- He's having sex with it like, oh, oh, oh, oh.

111
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:33,160
- And I bet when you, 'cause you just learned to jack off,

112
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:35,800
I bet you jizz in your shirt and throw it under your bed.

113
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:39,240
- I do that outside of the world of the podcast.

114
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:41,800
I still jack, I'll jizz into a t-shirt.

115
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:42,640
Every once in a while.

116
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:43,600
- I think you're supposed to.

117
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:45,360
- If it's the end of the t-shirts,

118
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:48,080
kinda, you know, if I'm worn it 14, 15 times,

119
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:52,000
I'm not gonna wear it again before I wash it.

120
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,280
I'm jizzing into one of those.

121
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:55,000
Then I'll jizz into it and throw it in the hamper.

122
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,080
One of those APC white t-shirts that are over, like,

123
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:58,080
the really long ones.

124
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:01,360
I jizzed into the raw denim I just bought.

125
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:02,800
Yeah, that's how you break it in.

126
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:06,960
You get in the bathtub, you just jizz it in 5,000 times.

127
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:09,280
Just stretch it out.

128
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:11,000
But to answer your question, yeah,

129
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,680
I basically use this as a complete cum rag.

130
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:13,640
Do you want to smell it?

131
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:15,640
Actually, a hack that you can use when you're jizzing--

132
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:16,480
Oh, it's so crunchy.

133
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:20,400
--if you jizz straight into the washing machine,

134
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:21,400
it goes away.

135
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:23,280
- Then all your shirts will get jizzed up.

136
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:24,800
- No, no, it sucks it all out.

137
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:25,760
- Yeah, it just cleans it.

138
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:26,600
I mean, it's a cleaning machine.

139
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:27,560
- That's actually a good point.

140
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:28,760
If I jizz in all my shirts,

141
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:31,720
'cause I've done three jizzes in one shirt before.

142
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:33,960
(laughing)

143
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:38,000
If I jizz in my shirt a bunch of times,

144
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,480
then I take it to the laundromat I go to, which is public,

145
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:42,800
is there like people who are getting their clothes done

146
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,600
and they get tiny little speckles of my jizz in there?

147
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:46,080
- Oh yeah, you probably, somebody probably--

148
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:48,200
- No, so you know what it is?

149
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:50,160
Is these laundromats nowadays,

150
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:53,960
they have they have lint traps, but a lot of these places are advanced.

151
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:57,360
They have lint traps in the dryers, but in the washers, they have jizz traps,

152
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:59,860
which are these little, it's a little bucket that they pull out.

153
00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:02,860
Do you know? And it's like you pull it out and it's like a drawer.

154
00:05:02,860 --> 00:05:03,560
That's like a tray.

155
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:04,160
Oh, that's like a gray water?

156
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:07,960
Uh-huh. Yeah, and they pull that out. And what a lot of these, I mean,

157
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:12,860
I don't want to be the one to break this to you, but they're selling that.

158
00:05:12,860 --> 00:05:14,260
They're selling the jizz?

159
00:05:14,260 --> 00:05:16,160
Yeah, they sell it to like many places.

160
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:16,860
Well, it gets diluted.

161
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:19,660
They sell it to women's shelters for single women who want to have a baby,

162
00:05:19,660 --> 00:05:23,760
But they can't cuz men can't be around I'm a Christian and that's fucking human trafficking

163
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:26,780
That is true as fuck

164
00:05:26,780 --> 00:05:33,140
That is true as fuck dude. Can you imagine our eighth grade asses being getting to sneak into the women's shelters? Oh?

165
00:05:33,140 --> 00:05:37,780
My god, I bet it's so hot in there. I what I was in seventh grade

166
00:05:37,780 --> 00:05:43,740
I set up a GoPro in the women's shelter that is I bet it is so hot in there pillow fights every single night

167
00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:46,260
pillow fights

168
00:05:46,260 --> 00:05:48,520
(laughter)

169
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:55,740
- Oh my god dude, we should dress in all black

170
00:05:55,740 --> 00:05:57,420
and wear our night vision goggles and go in there.

171
00:05:57,420 --> 00:05:58,460
- Yes, and sneak in.

172
00:05:58,460 --> 00:06:00,700
- Crawl through the vents.

173
00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:01,940
- Be awesome dude.

174
00:06:01,940 --> 00:06:03,260
- I saw they do that in movies.

175
00:06:03,260 --> 00:06:04,380
- Yeah, yeah.

176
00:06:04,380 --> 00:06:05,580
- I saw it at a Tom Cruise movie.

177
00:06:05,580 --> 00:06:06,420
- That's my main thing.

178
00:06:06,420 --> 00:06:08,860
- Patrick's tell me things is hot when girls cry.

179
00:06:08,860 --> 00:06:10,620
He said that.

180
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:11,820
- I did not say that.

181
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:14,820
- Yeah, you said that in Mrs. Marfanee's class.

182
00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:16,060
- Mrs. Marfan's class?

183
00:06:16,060 --> 00:06:18,020
This is my fans.

184
00:06:18,020 --> 00:06:20,300
Remember when the reason they have that syndrome.

185
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:21,340
She should have been a Hooper.

186
00:06:21,340 --> 00:06:22,460
Remember you said.

187
00:06:22,460 --> 00:06:26,260
Remember last year before he got a little more mature and he would chase the girls.

188
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:26,620
Yeah.

189
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:27,860
I was on my finger.

190
00:06:27,860 --> 00:06:30,580
He said that he wants to show the girls again in a few years.

191
00:06:30,580 --> 00:06:30,980
Yeah.

192
00:06:30,980 --> 00:06:31,780
Yeah.

193
00:06:31,780 --> 00:06:33,300
I think I'm going to have bigger.

194
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:37,060
That's why you don't have a way bigger boogers when I'm older.

195
00:06:37,060 --> 00:06:38,900
You said that's why you want to get a learner's permit.

196
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:40,260
So you're better at chasing girls.

197
00:06:40,260 --> 00:06:40,620
Yeah.

198
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:44,020
You said you your dad let you watch the movie duel.

199
00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:49,100
It's about it's this movie no one knows about no

200
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:55,220
I'm an eighth grader, and I watched that movie on TV. You're essentially the nerdy movie kid right okay first of all

201
00:06:55,220 --> 00:06:57,340
I'm not a nerd and second of all we're in a grade

202
00:06:57,340 --> 00:07:02,500
We're in eighth grade and movies are cool back now Simon and a double Alvin mm-hmm - did you guys?

210
00:07:45,780 --> 00:07:50,660
Yeah. Yeah. I'm glad that we weren't doing it. We would have needed a bigger camera. Yeah.

211
00:07:50,660 --> 00:07:55,060
Yeah, the file sizes would be too big no one to be able to download the show. Yep.

212
00:07:55,060 --> 00:07:58,660
Yeah, I'm really glad that we weren't doing video back when I had that brown

213
00:07:58,660 --> 00:08:03,540
birth marker on my mouth. Oh yeah. That was bad. Yeah. Yeah, I really like the show, but

214
00:08:03,540 --> 00:08:06,460
This guy eat poop all the time. I know yeah, that would have been bad

215
00:08:06,460 --> 00:08:09,900
That would have been horrible if we ate poop on camera. Yeah, luckily we never did that

216
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:17,100
You know and we got basically all the tools to stay up all night. We got some cherries seven up. Yeah

00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:07,340
Two things I need to say before I mean I know we're not gonna sleep, but if we do fall asleep

Speak for yourself. I ain't sleeping. Yeah, no way if I all the way till midnight, okay?

229
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:21,700
Combined with sleepwalking. What do you guys think the hardest penis could ever be?

230
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:24,500
probably a diamond penis

231
00:09:25,580 --> 00:09:33,300
From it from from rock man or colossus from x-men's rock man, and he's gay, too

232
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:37,020
What do you guys want to do? I'm in eighth grade, and I don't understand that yet

233
00:09:37,020 --> 00:09:40,220
Oh, yeah, well, I don't know anybody I was I was held back

234
00:09:40,220 --> 00:09:43,660
I'm supposed to be a freshman a gay man held you know

235
00:09:43,660 --> 00:09:48,860

236
00:09:48,860 --> 00:09:52,440
He held your back up. Yeah, and that's how you know about diamond penis. Yeah

237
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:54,840
I got fucked with a diamond penis.

238
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:55,680
- Oh my god.

239
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:56,600
- By a gay guy.

240
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:59,120
- If I guess if I had to get fucked with a penis,

241
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:00,520
I might as well be a diamond one.

242
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:01,360
- 'Cause you'd feel like a pretty princess.

243
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:02,200
- That's prestigious.

244
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:03,440
- Oh, hmm.

245
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:05,040
- Actually got fucked with a diamond penis.

246
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:08,280
- I would choose a big one.

247
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:09,120
- Yeah.

248
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:10,860
- Yeah, or no, a small one.

249
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:11,700
- Probably.

250
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:13,440
- I'd choose a middle of the road.

251
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:14,680
- Right, average.

252
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:15,520
- I would say about the end of my life.

253
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:17,240
- I'd choose one that was just right.

254
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:18,640
- I'd choose whatever one's nearby

255
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:19,840
so I don't have to wait.

256
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:21,960
- Yeah.

257
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:23,480
That'd be the piss me off.

258
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:24,720
Well, that's just like you're sitting there like,

259
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:26,680
"I know I'm gonna get fucked."

260
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:27,520
Yeah, yeah.

261
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:28,480
"When is this gonna happen?

262
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:31,280
"When are they gonna find a guy with a diamond penis?"

263
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:32,120
Could be years.

264
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:33,040
Probably not, not ever, yeah.

265
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:34,240
What time are we at?

266
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:35,320
What time is it right now?

267
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:36,160
Oh my God.

268
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:36,980
It's already 8 p.m.?

269
00:10:36,980 --> 00:10:37,820
It's 8 o'clock.

270
00:10:37,820 --> 00:10:38,640
It's going so fast, you guys.

271
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:40,360
I feel like we should get into some slumber party fare.

272
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:41,200
Okay, all right.

273
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:42,120
So obviously we have our chips,

274
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:44,080
which by the way, these are red spicy chips.

275
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:45,920
Everybody has to do a one chip challenge.

276
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:46,760
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

277
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:48,480
'Cause I've been eating these the whole time.

278
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:50,480

Oh, it's so spicy!

284
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:06,980

00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:08,980
I can handle it.

287
00:11:08,980 --> 00:11:10,480
Are these ketchup chips?

288
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:11,480
I don't know.

289
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:12,480
These taste like ketchup.

- Well, it's obviously the person who asked.

330
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:18,200
- I think it's gotta be the person who asked.

331
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:20,440
- It says not your partner, and we're kind of partners

332
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:22,680
'cause I asked, so it's kind of like a partner to work to.

daily double dare. Fuck. You fucking asshole. Yep, daily double dare for you. And it has

344
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:49,240
to be extreme and hot. Okay. You have an extremely hot dare coming your way because you wouldn't

345
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:53,680
get a sensual massage. Oh boohoo. It's against the rules of the game. It's not against the

346
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:56,040
fucking rules you asked that. It's against the rules. It's against the rules to not do

347
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:56,880
- Can I click it?

348
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:58,640
It doesn't, you have to send it.

349
00:13:58,640 --> 00:13:59,920
- Okay, I'll do it.

350
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:01,920
- It's tech, this is mine, I guess, technically.

351
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:05,080
- An extreme and hot dare, okay?

352
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:06,020
Here it is.

353
00:14:06,020 --> 00:14:10,320
- This is the dare.

354
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:12,520
What is your favorite sex position?

355
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:14,760
(laughing)

356
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:19,200
Click dare, that's what came up.

357
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:20,040
- Okay.

358
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:21,160
- Try to do another one, he's got a double.

359
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:24,080
- No, that, you can't get a, you can't, no, no, no, no, no.

360
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:24,920
You can't get two.

361
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:28,280
That's not fair. I already wasn't even supposed to have this.

362
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:32,280
It was your dare, first of all. You're the one who didn't do it.

363
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:36,040
Because you... No, I didn't refuse. You could do it right now. I'm right here.

364
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:39,960
Get your feet on the table. I'm sitting right here. He's the one not doing the dare.

365
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:43,000
I was about to answer that question, but now we're having a war.

366
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:46,760
Okay, war is over because I declared it and I'm God in the scenario.

367
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:49,240
Okay, more like I'm God and I declared it.

368
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:52,920
War is over. No, I already declared the war was over.

369
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:53,920
War is back.

370
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:54,920
No, we don't want the war back.

371
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:55,920
War is back.

372
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:56,920
He's fighting it.

373
00:14:56,920 --> 00:14:57,920
He started a war.

374
00:14:57,920 --> 00:14:58,920
I'm completely...

375
00:14:58,920 --> 00:14:59,920
He obeyed.

376
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:00,920
And now you know what?

377
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:01,920
I'm on his side.

378
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:02,920
Oh my god, Caleb just obeyed me.

379
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:05,920
Okay, I just became a Buddhist style not guy.

380
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:07,920
So I just say no to everything and crap like that.

381
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:08,920
Okay, what are we doing?

382
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:09,920
So you...

383
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:12,920
That's one of the Buddhist boosts invented, saying not.

384
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:13,920
They go, "Nah."

385
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:15,920
Yeah, I'm definitely going to do something.

386
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:18,920
Nah, I'm going to sit here and do nothing.

387
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:21,920
You have to answer the question, "What's your favorite sex position?"

388
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:28,920
Yeah, I bet you haven't even fucking had sex, you kid, because you're a little kid.

389
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:29,920
Uh, mine would probably be...

390
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:31,920
I'm gonna have soda and there's nothing you can do.

391
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:32,920
I like, I like...

392
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:34,920
It's too hard to open!

393
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:35,920
Um...

394
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:36,920
You cheated.

395
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:37,920
I'm trying to answer the question.

396
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:38,920
Sorry.

397
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:41,920
Mine's probably like, on the couch.

398
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:42,920
Okay.

399
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:44,920
On the couch or in the bed.

00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:46,920
My two top, my top two.

401
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:48,920
You have to hold your mic up.

402
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:49,920
That's actually good as fuck.

403
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:53,420
Don't spit it out. No it didn't

404
00:15:53,420 --> 00:15:57,740
Your voice is so deep for a child. It went up my nose

405
00:15:57,740 --> 00:16:02,480
What's your favorite you said I said couch or bed

406
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:07,500

Like from underneath or from above reaches up her pulls her dress over and shows you all of it

413
00:16:27,700 --> 00:16:33,420
It's not so you like your favorite sex position is mooning when your girl shows pulls up her dress and shows it all

414
00:16:33,420 --> 00:16:41,960
Every last piece of it every piece every it's as if she's completely naked under her dress. Yeah, I actually like that, too

415
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:45,840
Okay, can it be my turn to do a truth or dare? Yeah, I choose hard

416
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:52,240
Okay, oh, so my penis is and I choose truth

00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:40,880
So the thing is the lucky for me is that first of all I don't have to do that because I already did my truth

439
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:46,120
But also I don't have a crush because I haven't started thinking about that kind of stuff really I have a crush

Lana Roode. Scientists have finally made my crush.

463
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:19,840
Take the average of every porn star ever. This is what her body

464
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:23,840
would look like. It's just a piece of fudge.

465
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:27,840
Oh man.

466
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:28,840

00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:35,840
Bro, it's about to get so fucking late.

472
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:36,840
Yeah.

473
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:40,480
Okay, real quick, what's your favorite fucking curse word?

474
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:41,480
Double fuck.

475
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:42,480
What's a double fuck?

476
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:43,480
It's a double the amount.

477
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:44,480
It's that double the badness of fuck.

478
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:45,480
F-F-U-U-C-C-K.

479
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:51,360
No, you say double fuck and it means it's twice as bad.

480
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:53,360
So your parents hurt you twice.

481
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:54,920
I'm just being weird over here.

482
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:56,400

Yeah, she is a little bit hot.

521
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:32,200
The sluttiest person I know at the school is Janitor Rick.

522
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:33,200
Yeah.

523
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:36,480
Also, I don't want to brag, but the sluttiest person at school is actually me.

524
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:37,480
Damn!

525
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:40,840
That's why my mom hates when I fucking hang out with you, but I'll pound it because she's

526
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:41,840

527
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:42,840
Yeah.

528
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:43,840
Do we have any-- do you guys want to do anything else?

529
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:46,200
He's like a slut for guys.

530
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:47,200
As a guy.

531
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:48,200
He's a guy slut.

532
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:49,200
I'm a man slut.

533
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:50,200
A man-- Whoa.

534
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:52,640
- Have you guys seen Deuce Bigalow, Eurachia?

535
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:55,840
- They based that movie off my dad.

536
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:58,760
- You're friends with him on Facebook, me too.

537
00:22:58,760 --> 00:23:03,000
He's, every week he's got a new relationship status.

538
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:06,800
He goes one week single, one week he's dating Jessica.

539
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:09,640
It's complicated with Jessica, single again.

540
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:14,640
Then married to Ashley, then married to Denise.

541
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:19,640
Married to, he gets married to all these women on Facebook.

542
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:20,600
And then they have to get a divorce.

543
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:22,140
And cousins with Sarah.

544
00:23:22,140 --> 00:23:22,980
Do you guys wanna do--

545
00:23:22,980 --> 00:23:25,280
One time he was dating his Facebook cousin.

546
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:26,960
Do you guys wanna do Would You Rather?

547
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:27,960
Yeah. Yeah.

548
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:28,800
All right.

549
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:31,120
Who wants to start?

550
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:32,220
Would you rather,

551
00:23:32,220 --> 00:23:36,440
would you rather have,

552
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:40,120
would you rather eat poop made out of cream cheese?

553
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:41,800
Yes, I'd eat that.

554
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:44,040
(laughing)

555
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:46,280
(laughing)

556
00:23:46,280 --> 00:23:56,800
- Yeah, uh-huh.

557
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:59,380
Keep going.

558
00:23:59,380 --> 00:24:01,360
Poop made out of cream cheese or what?

559
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:02,360
- Poop made out of cream cheese

560
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:04,720
or pee made out of sour cream?

561
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:07,680
Oh my god, I didn't know you were gonna finish the sentence.

562
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:09,120
(laughing)

563
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:10,280
- I didn't know there was a second part

564
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:11,480
to the would you rather.

565
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:14,480
That was just the first part.

566
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:17,560
GBO, can you look up some would you rathers for us to play?

567
00:24:17,560 --> 00:24:18,600
Nobody answered mine.

568
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:21,440
Okay, I would rather eat poop made out of cream cheese.

569
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:23,000
Of course, dude.

570
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,560
Would you rather question--

571
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:25,400
Wait, would it still--

572
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:27,200
Would you rather have sex with the most disgusting girl

573
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:32,200
on the planet or have $1 only?

574
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:35,000
Okay, I have some that I wrote myself.

575
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:35,840
Okay.

576
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:38,480
Okay, guys, these are pretty badass for a slumber party.

577
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:40,520
Okay, okay, okay, go, go, go.

578
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:42,520
Would you rather be a lion or a tiger?

579
00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:44,520
Tiger.

580
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:45,520
Why?

581
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:46,520
I'm striped.

582
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:47,520
Oh yeah, that'd be cool.

583
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:48,520
I'd be a lion.

584
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:51,520
Would you rather have a playhouse or a trampoline?

585
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:52,520
Trampoline.

586
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:53,520
Trampoline.

587
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:54,520
Bro!

588
00:24:54,520 --> 00:24:55,520
I would rather have a playhouse.

589
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:56,520
We say bro in 8th grade.

590
00:24:56,520 --> 00:24:59,520
I would rather have a playhouse so I could do girls inside my playhouse.

591
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:02,520
Oh, that's nasty but actually fucking sick.

592
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:06,520
Would you rather never use a dildo again or never use a vibrator again?

593
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:09,520
Probably never use a dildo again.

594
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:14,580
Yeah, I would choose that too. Yeah. Would you rather have it in the morning or late into the evening?

595
00:25:14,580 --> 00:25:16,580
Well, what is that about? I think it's probably dinner.

596
00:25:16,580 --> 00:25:18,580
Oh, I would have dinner in the morning.

597
00:25:18,580 --> 00:25:20,580
I don't want dinner in the morning. Steak and eggs?

598
00:25:20,580 --> 00:25:22,580
That's breakfast.

599
00:25:22,580 --> 00:25:25,580
That's a good point. I've been eating that for dinner for so long.

600
00:25:25,580 --> 00:25:29,580
Would you rather discover I was a sex offender or a drugs addict?

601
00:25:29,580 --> 00:25:31,580
Drugs addict.

602
00:25:31,580 --> 00:25:33,580
Sex offender? But a drug addict. You're a sex offender?

603
00:25:33,580 --> 00:25:35,580
No, I can't be a sex offender.

604
00:25:35,580 --> 00:25:37,580
I thought you just said you're a sex offender. He's a sex offender.

605
00:25:37,580 --> 00:25:42,420
Fucking 13. How can you be a sex offender when you're 13? That's what I'm saying dude. Shut the fuck up and stop spreading rumors.

606
00:25:42,420 --> 00:25:46,580
You're one of the five year olds? You're fucking a gossip and I bet you hang out at the lunch table with all the-

607
00:25:46,580 --> 00:25:51,660
I was fucking a gossip at lunch one time. Damn! Gossiping girl. Shut the fuck up.

608
00:25:51,660 --> 00:25:58,820
Would you rather sleep with someone you think is disgusting but the sex is off the charts or sleep with a person you're find extremely hot but the sex sucks?

609
00:25:58,820 --> 00:26:00,820
I would want to do both.

610
00:26:00,820 --> 00:26:05,180
I would love to have disgusting sex with a fucking ugly bitch.

611
00:26:05,180 --> 00:26:07,440
(laughing)

612
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:10,580
- As an eighth grader, that is my dream.

613
00:26:10,580 --> 00:26:11,700
- Sounds like onage.

614
00:26:11,700 --> 00:26:15,620
- I also never want to do drugs or alcohol

615
00:26:15,620 --> 00:26:17,260
'cause I think God has a purpose for me.

616
00:26:17,260 --> 00:26:18,960
(laughing)

617
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:20,980
- There's no doubt in my mind that one day

618
00:26:20,980 --> 00:26:23,740
God will make you a CEO or a fucking--

619
00:26:23,740 --> 00:26:25,340
- Or maybe I'll have to go to war

620
00:26:25,340 --> 00:26:26,940
and I'll turn the tide of the battle.

621
00:26:26,940 --> 00:26:29,220
- And maybe you'll be like David Goliath.

622
00:26:29,220 --> 00:26:31,780
- If I drink, I'll like fall, my body will be sick.

623
00:26:31,780 --> 00:26:34,580
- I think that one day I'm gonna smoke one cigarette

624
00:26:34,580 --> 00:26:36,340
and then never smoke a cigarette again.

625
00:26:36,340 --> 00:26:37,180
And it'll be on the news.

626
00:26:37,180 --> 00:26:38,900
- Yeah, when I'm 18, I'm gonna buy a pack of cigarettes.

627
00:26:38,900 --> 00:26:40,560
I'm not gonna smoke them, but you just,

628
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:41,700
you get the privilege.

629
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:43,180
I'm gonna buy a pack of cigarettes,

630
00:26:43,180 --> 00:26:44,400
I'm gonna give them to a hobo.

631
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:46,620
- I think when I'm 70, I'll probably start doing

632
00:26:46,620 --> 00:26:48,060
like heroin and crack and shit.

633
00:26:48,060 --> 00:26:48,900
- DMT.

634
00:26:48,900 --> 00:26:50,860
- Yeah, DMT. - Bro, DMT.

635
00:26:50,860 --> 00:26:51,940
- Because it's like, at that point,

636
00:26:51,940 --> 00:26:53,060
it doesn't fucking matter about--

637
00:26:53,060 --> 00:26:54,700
- Yeah, it's like, I might as well be fucking dead

638
00:26:54,700 --> 00:26:55,520
when I'm 70.

639
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:56,360
- By the time you're 50 or 30?

640
00:26:56,360 --> 00:26:58,460
- I'd be like, to all my kids and grandkids,

641
00:26:58,460 --> 00:27:00,060
I'd be like this, fuck this, I'm out.

642
00:27:00,060 --> 00:27:01,220
Yeah, I probably killed myself.

643
00:27:01,220 --> 00:27:02,860
I'd slit my throat in the bathtub.

644
00:27:02,860 --> 00:27:03,940
Here's a would you rather.

645
00:27:03,940 --> 00:27:04,440
OK.

646
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:07,380
Would you rather have bad breath or smelly private parts?

647
00:27:07,380 --> 00:27:08,420
Smelly private parts.

648
00:27:08,420 --> 00:27:08,920
Look.

649
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:10,300
Smelly private parts.

650
00:27:10,300 --> 00:27:10,800
I smell--

651
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:12,340
Because my mom don't smell my private parts,

652
00:27:12,340 --> 00:27:13,860
but she'll kick my ass if she smells my private parts.

653
00:27:13,860 --> 00:27:15,780
Yo, your mom smells my private parts, though.

654
00:27:15,780 --> 00:27:16,280
[EXPLOSION]

655
00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:16,780
Holy cow.

656
00:27:16,780 --> 00:27:17,280
All right.

657
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:19,660
That's OK, because you know that she's a fucking pediatrician,

658
00:27:19,660 --> 00:27:21,460
so that's probably part of her job is when she has you--

659
00:27:21,460 --> 00:27:22,500
Yeah, she does smell my private parts.

660
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:23,180
--in the appointment.

661
00:27:23,180 --> 00:27:24,500
So it's not that big of a deal.

662
00:27:24,500 --> 00:27:25,580
At the appointment.

663
00:27:25,580 --> 00:27:26,780
I put her on the paper table.

664
00:27:26,780 --> 00:27:29,940
Would you rather have a premature--

665
00:27:29,940 --> 00:27:32,220
- A premature-- - When Caleb's mom

666
00:27:32,220 --> 00:27:33,740
is working at the pediatrician's office,

667
00:27:33,740 --> 00:27:36,620
I put her on the paper table that they have there,

668
00:27:36,620 --> 00:27:39,020
and she gets so wet it turns to papier-mache.

669
00:27:39,020 --> 00:27:42,820
- Would you rather have a premature climax

670
00:27:42,820 --> 00:27:45,380
or never climax at all?

671
00:27:45,380 --> 00:27:46,660
- What's that?

672
00:27:46,660 --> 00:27:47,900
- I don't know, I'm just reading it.

673
00:27:47,900 --> 00:27:49,300
- Oh, that's the thing-- - Premature is like what?

674
00:27:49,300 --> 00:27:51,040
- Oh, premature is when-- - The climax is that thing

675
00:27:51,040 --> 00:27:53,380
on top of the vagina that girls want you to lick.

676
00:27:53,380 --> 00:27:55,140
- Oh. - Yeah.

677
00:27:55,140 --> 00:27:57,140
- Wait, and a premature is like a baby

678
00:27:57,140 --> 00:27:58,300
who's born early, right?

679
00:27:58,300 --> 00:28:01,740
So it's asking, why would a website, why would you ask that?

680
00:28:01,740 --> 00:28:03,740
That's fucking disgusting as shit.

681
00:28:03,740 --> 00:28:06,100
I'm fucking, what's this?

682
00:28:06,100 --> 00:28:07,260
Is this what Climax is?

683
00:28:07,260 --> 00:28:08,300
Pull this open.

684
00:28:08,300 --> 00:28:09,140
Yeah.

685
00:28:09,140 --> 00:28:09,980
Oh, we found it.

686
00:28:09,980 --> 00:28:10,800
Oh.

687
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:11,640
That's what it is.

688
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:13,420
It's like when you get really close to your friend's face.

689
00:28:13,420 --> 00:28:14,260
That's not that crazy.

690
00:28:14,260 --> 00:28:15,700
I can Climax with you right now.

691
00:28:15,700 --> 00:28:17,000
I'll Climax with Patrick.

692
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:20,180
I wanna Climax with you now, Cameron.

693
00:28:20,180 --> 00:28:24,580
That's not that bad.

694
00:28:24,580 --> 00:28:25,400
That's normal.

695
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:26,780
I don't mind having that at all.

696
00:28:26,780 --> 00:28:28,280
I don't like that premature.

697
00:28:28,280 --> 00:28:29,280
I'm not matching with my friends.

698
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:30,940
Look, I'm still not, my body's not mature.

699
00:28:30,940 --> 00:28:31,940
I'm still growing.

700
00:28:31,940 --> 00:28:32,940
I'm not mature either.

701
00:28:32,940 --> 00:28:33,940
Yeah.

702
00:28:33,940 --> 00:28:34,940
Yeah.

703
00:28:34,940 --> 00:28:35,940
So I guess we all just had a premature climax.

704
00:28:35,940 --> 00:28:37,900
I have one curly, swirly pube.

705
00:28:37,900 --> 00:28:38,900
Yeah.

706
00:28:38,900 --> 00:28:40,940
It's half white, half black.

707
00:28:40,940 --> 00:28:42,940
Are you guys uncut or cut?

708
00:28:42,940 --> 00:28:43,940
What?

709
00:28:43,940 --> 00:28:44,940
I got halfway.

710
00:28:44,940 --> 00:28:45,940
What are you talking about?

711
00:28:45,940 --> 00:28:46,940
Your penis is halfway cut.

712
00:28:46,940 --> 00:28:49,260
Yeah, they interrupted the procedure.

713
00:28:49,260 --> 00:28:50,580
Someone ran in like at a wedding.

714
00:28:50,580 --> 00:28:51,580
Yeah.

715
00:28:51,580 --> 00:28:52,580
Oh, okay.

716
00:28:52,580 --> 00:28:53,580
They said forever hold your peace.

717
00:28:53,580 --> 00:28:58,580
Do you guys, does it stink when you pull it back?

718
00:28:58,580 --> 00:29:00,460
- Mine doesn't pull back.

719
00:29:00,460 --> 00:29:02,700
Mine's already professionally pulled back by a doctor.

720
00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:04,660
- Oh, okay, so yours is cut off.

721
00:29:04,660 --> 00:29:05,940
- Or they taped it or something.

722
00:29:05,940 --> 00:29:07,300
- I have half stink.

723
00:29:07,300 --> 00:29:09,420
- Okay, so when you pull back the half part--

724
00:29:09,420 --> 00:29:10,520
- Spiders.

725
00:29:10,520 --> 00:29:12,500
- You get a spider comes out.

726
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:14,420
- Yeah, I put a coin in there.

727
00:29:14,420 --> 00:29:15,340
- When I was camping.

728
00:29:15,340 --> 00:29:16,940
- I put a coin in there to,

729
00:29:16,940 --> 00:29:21,980
I put a coin in my foreskin to stop the pee from coming out.

730
00:29:21,980 --> 00:29:23,820
Do you guys like camping even?

731
00:29:23,820 --> 00:29:24,820
I hate camping.

732
00:29:24,820 --> 00:29:25,820
I don't like it.

733
00:29:25,820 --> 00:29:26,820
I think it's fucking overrated.

734
00:29:26,820 --> 00:29:28,860
Yeah, it's like get me back home where I can play Monopoly.

735
00:29:28,860 --> 00:29:30,540
The computer's at home.

736
00:29:30,540 --> 00:29:32,460
Wait, the clock just ticked again.

737
00:29:32,460 --> 00:29:33,460
Oh my god.

738
00:29:33,460 --> 00:29:34,460
Guys, it's 10.

739
00:29:34,460 --> 00:29:35,460
Holy shit.

740
00:29:35,460 --> 00:29:38,900
Now this is what I would call, we were in like pre, like normal night.

741
00:29:38,900 --> 00:29:40,560
This is what I would call late night now.

742
00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:41,560
Late night, yeah.

743
00:29:41,560 --> 00:29:42,560
Let's get late night.

744
00:29:42,560 --> 00:29:44,020
This is when TVs start turning off and stuff.

745
00:29:44,020 --> 00:29:49,220
I mean, I actually have something that I wanted to share with you guys.

746
00:29:49,220 --> 00:29:50,220
Really?

747
00:29:50,220 --> 00:29:51,220
Yeah.

748
00:29:51,220 --> 00:29:53,220
- Did you say that to me?

749
00:29:53,220 --> 00:29:55,040
- You did not just say that.

750
00:29:55,040 --> 00:29:55,880
- Wait, to me?

751
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:56,700
- I didn't mean that.

752
00:29:56,700 --> 00:29:57,540
- To me?

753
00:29:57,540 --> 00:29:59,380
- I meant whip out the thing that you wanna show me.

754
00:29:59,380 --> 00:30:01,840
- Do you know that's when a baby has had a seed

755
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:04,220
goes into the woman's stomach and it grows.

756
00:30:04,220 --> 00:30:06,800
- What are you talking about?

757
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:07,880
Just open up your thing.

758
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:09,380
- It's like a garden in there.

759
00:30:09,380 --> 00:30:11,080
- What the fuck is on there?

760
00:30:11,080 --> 00:30:13,480
- Apparently a woman has a pot inside her that grows.

761
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:14,320
- Are you like, did you like--

762
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:16,160
- It's like the mandrakes from Harry Potter.

763
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:18,160
- Do you like not even know anything about sex ed

764
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:19,840
from class, you fucking asshole?

765
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:22,720
That's why a woman can suck the thing,

766
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:25,720
'cause it gets dirt off of it and it goes into her stomach.

767
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:27,440
He said that when--

768
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:29,560
You guys literally don't know anything about sex.

769
00:30:29,560 --> 00:30:31,360
The whole thing of sex that I learned in school

770
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:33,840
is you basically want the smallest pussy of all time

771
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:35,360
to make you cum faster so you can make

772
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:37,560
as many fucking kids as possible.

773
00:30:37,560 --> 00:30:38,640
Make you fucking-- I thought I'd shoot it

774
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:39,480
all in the butt. Apparently,

775
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:42,320
if a pussy is really fucking small,

776
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:44,320
it'll make you fucking cum instantly.

777
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:45,880
(laughing)

778
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:49,800
If the pussy is like the size of a fucking molecule,

779
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:53,060

I've heard that.

791
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:28,180
This is how you tell what a pussy would look like.

792
00:31:28,180 --> 00:31:30,340
Do that again.

793
00:31:30,340 --> 00:31:31,340
This your mom's pussy?

794
00:31:31,340 --> 00:31:32,340
There's probably something like that.

795
00:31:32,340 --> 00:31:33,340
I haven't seen it.

796
00:31:33,340 --> 00:31:36,340

00:33:16,900 --> 00:33:19,940

00:34:22,440 --> 00:34:24,440
Do you have any fucking money? I don't have shit.

851
00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:26,440
I have five dollars.

852
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:28,440
Wait, we could sell the soda.

853
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:30,440
We could sell the soda.

854
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:32,440
We could sell what's in it to a journalist.

855
00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:34,440
Tell us what's in that.

856
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:36,440

Dear Diary, I have a huge crush on a cute boy.

860
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:47,440
Also Cameron shat his pants again.

861
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:48,440
We're not going to read this one.

862
00:34:48,440 --> 00:34:49,440
What?

863
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:50,440
Wait, just go back.

864
00:34:50,440 --> 00:34:51,440
No, go back to that.

865
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:52,440
We're going to move.

866
00:34:52,440 --> 00:34:53,440
No, let's read it if that one wasn't.

867
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:54,440
Go back to that.

868
00:34:54,440 --> 00:34:55,440
There's not much in that one.

869
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:56,440
Oh, here's one.

870
00:34:56,440 --> 00:34:57,440
You didn't even finish it.

871
00:34:57,440 --> 00:34:58,440
Wait, you guys are going to like this one.

872
00:34:58,440 --> 00:34:59,440
Okay.

873
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:00,440
You guys are going to like this one.

874
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:01,440
I'm excited to hear this.

875
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:08,440
I'm having girly thoughts all the time.

876
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:11,440
Oh my god!

877
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:13,440
Also Cameron shat on the floor of his bedroom.

878
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:14,440
What the hell?

879
00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:17,440
He left it there all night while he slept and we didn't find it until the morning.

880
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:19,440
I wonder if he just liked the smell or something.

881
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:21,440
Wait, no, keep, no, just keep reading that.

882
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:24,440
No, you know what, these are from a long time ago, so we're gonna go to the end.

883
00:35:24,440 --> 00:35:25,440
I wanna read that.

884
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:27,440
It's probably from when I was a baby, it's probably from my diaper, so.

885
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:29,440
Wait, but she was having serious fucking crushes?

886
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:37,020
Let's know I'll just read whatever here. I'll just already did a hand job. Oh, dude. This was this was long okay here we go

887
00:35:37,020 --> 00:35:44,640
This one. Oh yeah here get ready. Okay, okay, dear diary. There was a lot of drama today at school. I

888
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:48,960
Fucking love drama all my friends were talking about it

889
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:55,000
They announced over the loudspeaker that everybody had to stay in their classrooms because they were transferring this kid to the hospital

890
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:59,940
I didn't know who it was at first, but lunch was afterward and I noticed Cameron wasn't in the lunchroom

891
00:35:59,940 --> 00:36:01,580
I don't remember this

892
00:36:01,580 --> 00:36:05,620
I wonder what could have happened and if Cameron could have been sent to the hospital

893
00:36:05,620 --> 00:36:08,520
Just then my friend Marcy tapped me on the shoulder

894
00:36:08,520 --> 00:36:14,720
But they had a lesbian fucking scissor fest and asked if I heard what happened

895
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:15,880
I said no

896
00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:20,280
And she said the kid who got sent to the hospital was this kid named Dustin who nobody knew and it was his first day

897
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:22,280
At school and he tried to do a backflip to impress everyone

898
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:24,960
But he landed on his neck and all his bones broke completely

899
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:30,780
Whoa she said that his bones broke so bad that they had to put him on a bowl shaped stretcher because his body became the

900
00:36:30,780 --> 00:36:32,780
Consistency of a gummy worm left in a hot car

901
00:36:32,780 --> 00:36:40,840
Just then Cameron came back from the bathroom, and he was leaving a trail of shit behind him like Splatoon 3 was just came out whoa

902
00:36:40,840 --> 00:36:46,600
Wait Splatoon 3 just came out. This is probably from a long time ago. That game came out this year.

903
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:49,280
No, you left a trail of shit right behind you

904
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:55,560
By the way that fart was fucking rad as fuck high-five that yes, sir, okay?

905
00:36:55,560 --> 00:36:58,700
But we actually have to replace this because I'm gonna get fucking grounded as shit. Yeah

906
00:36:58,700 --> 00:37:03,420
I guess we do have to replace that I wonder and it's Caleb's fault. I ripped it open cuz he was

907
00:37:03,420 --> 00:37:09,400
Needling me to open it faster. What the worst thing is that it's it's a what is it 10 o'clock now?

908
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:15,320
The diary store is definitely closed definitely. It's still 10 o'clock. Oh my god. It's a let. It's still no it's still

909
00:37:15,320 --> 00:37:18,640
There's yeah, it's a 10 o'clock, okay

910
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:23,080
So what else do you leave the time checks to so to the people who can read a clock?

911
00:37:23,080 --> 00:37:28,160
Learn how to read a digital clock yet. Yeah, I can only read an analog clock. What else could we do you guys?

912
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:31,480
Oh, do you guys want to do seven minutes in heaven?

913
00:37:31,480 --> 00:37:34,480
Yeah, okay. Yeah

914
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:39,460
Okay, let's go. Okay. We all this. Okay. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go

915
00:37:39,460 --> 00:37:41,460
Oh

916
00:37:41,460 --> 00:37:55,380
Okay, so I guess I'm gonna be this close to your fucking butt. Oh get in what my

917
00:37:55,380 --> 00:38:01,020
God, what is it going on in here dude? Are we gonna kiss each other?

918
00:38:01,020 --> 00:38:08,500
We have to check off in here what do we have to jack each other off? Why would we jack it?

919
00:38:08,500 --> 00:38:10,500
It's

920
00:38:10,500 --> 00:38:14,340
Something touch my fucking feet dude what?

921
00:38:14,340 --> 00:38:20,340
I

922
00:38:20,340 --> 00:38:23,140
Have to go back for him. He's still in there

923
00:38:23,140 --> 00:38:31,500
Patrick Pat fuck Pat are you in your Pat Pat?

924
00:38:31,500 --> 00:38:36,500
(screams)

925
00:38:36,500 --> 00:38:38,500
- Oh my god.

926
00:38:38,500 --> 00:38:40,500
- Dude.

927
00:38:40,500 --> 00:38:42,500
- That was crazy.

928
00:38:42,500 --> 00:38:45,500
- That was some of the craziest ish we ever did.

929
00:38:45,500 --> 00:38:46,500
- Talk about fucking awkward.

930
00:38:46,500 --> 00:38:47,500
- Yeah.

931
00:38:47,500 --> 00:38:48,500
- Yeah.

932
00:38:48,500 --> 00:38:49,500
- That was awkward.

933
00:38:49,500 --> 00:38:52,500
- I think that we've changed the trajectory of our lives in a way that we won't understand until we go to therapy.

934
00:38:52,500 --> 00:38:54,500
- We at least changed our friendships forever.

935
00:38:54,500 --> 00:38:55,500
- Mm-hmm.

936
00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:56,500
- Because that was seriously...

937
00:38:56,500 --> 00:38:58,500
- I think the trajectory of our friendship has totally changed.

938
00:38:58,500 --> 00:38:59,500
Totally changed.

939
00:38:59,500 --> 00:39:03,100
Is it okay for a woman to ask a man to marry him?

940
00:39:03,100 --> 00:39:07,100
I think like, probably in China.

941
00:39:07,100 --> 00:39:08,100
Yeah.

942
00:39:08,100 --> 00:39:09,100
Sorry.

943
00:39:09,100 --> 00:39:11,700
But I don't know about in America.

944
00:39:11,700 --> 00:39:13,260
Just trying to think of sleepover questions.

945
00:39:13,260 --> 00:39:15,380
Do you guys want to have a deep conversation?

946
00:39:15,380 --> 00:39:17,220
Yeah, let's do deep convo.

947
00:39:17,220 --> 00:39:18,220
Okay.

948
00:39:18,220 --> 00:39:21,540
Do you guys, so obviously my dad's a fucking pastor.

949
00:39:21,540 --> 00:39:22,540
Yeah.

950
00:39:22,540 --> 00:39:25,100
And that is fucking shit for me and shit.

951
00:39:25,100 --> 00:39:27,860
that's been a serious struggle because

952
00:39:27,860 --> 00:39:30,780
youth group is awesome when we watch movies

953
00:39:30,780 --> 00:39:33,260
and fucking pirates who don't do anything and shit,

954
00:39:33,260 --> 00:39:35,980
but once you get into the actual talking about stuff,

955
00:39:35,980 --> 00:39:39,700
it can be seriously fucked up the way that they say

956
00:39:39,700 --> 00:39:42,780
that the stuff that you actually can't do.

957
00:39:42,780 --> 00:39:44,420
So what I'm asking is basically,

958
00:39:44,420 --> 00:39:45,620
do you believe in God at all?

959
00:39:45,620 --> 00:39:48,140
- Well, I think like, I believe in God,

960
00:39:48,140 --> 00:39:50,520
but I don't think that he's necessarily,

961
00:39:50,520 --> 00:39:52,860
I don't think he's like a big guy in the sky

962
00:39:52,860 --> 00:39:54,420
with a beard or whatever.

963
00:39:54,420 --> 00:40:00,420
I think he could be like anything, like he could be an alien or like an overlord or like

964
00:40:00,420 --> 00:40:06,220
um he could be like a tornado like in Fantastic Four.

965
00:40:06,220 --> 00:40:10,860
I think he could be like a big alien or like a robot overlord.

966
00:40:10,860 --> 00:40:17,460
Recently I've been watching on the TV this guy Trevor Noah and he does not believe in

967
00:40:17,460 --> 00:40:18,460
God.

968
00:40:18,460 --> 00:40:19,460
He doesn't?

969
00:40:19,460 --> 00:40:23,780
He's actually given me a lot of insightful um...

970
00:40:23,780 --> 00:40:24,780
He doesn't believe in God.

971
00:40:24,780 --> 00:40:26,060
He doesn't believe in God.

972
00:40:26,060 --> 00:40:27,140
What does he believe in?

973
00:40:27,140 --> 00:40:29,460
He talks a lot about being a

974
00:40:29,460 --> 00:40:30,460
liberal.

975
00:40:30,460 --> 00:40:31,460
Does he believe in Allah?

976
00:40:31,460 --> 00:40:33,460
No, he doesn't believe in Allah.

977
00:40:33,460 --> 00:40:38,860
Are you sure?

978
00:40:38,860 --> 00:40:40,420
What does he believe in?

979
00:40:40,420 --> 00:40:42,280
I think he believes in there's

980
00:40:42,280 --> 00:40:43,280
no God and that

981
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:46,180
actually religious rites

982
00:40:46,180 --> 00:40:47,660
in this country are fucking up

983
00:40:47,660 --> 00:40:49,120
stuff for good people.

984
00:40:49,120 --> 00:40:50,300
He believes in Thor.

985
00:40:50,300 --> 00:40:52,500
But he's like a like a fucking.

986
00:40:52,580 --> 00:40:54,580
He's one of these atheistic Democrats,

987
00:40:54,580 --> 00:40:57,940
and usually my mom says, "Do not watch that stuff."

988
00:40:57,940 --> 00:40:59,740
But I've been watching a lot of it,

989
00:40:59,740 --> 00:41:02,660
and honestly, I have to sneak watch it,

990
00:41:02,660 --> 00:41:04,340
and I watch it, and honestly,

991
00:41:04,340 --> 00:41:07,100
most of that shit makes more sense

992
00:41:07,100 --> 00:41:09,260
than believing in some fucking guy in the sky.

993
00:41:09,260 --> 00:41:11,420
- Sometimes I feel like I'm at that age

994
00:41:11,420 --> 00:41:14,020
where I have to make a choice of whether I'm not gonna,

995
00:41:14,020 --> 00:41:15,340
whether I will be an atheist,

996
00:41:15,340 --> 00:41:17,460
and probably the way that I'll die is I'll probably get,

997
00:41:17,460 --> 00:41:19,740
I'll probably be so depressed that I'll make some,

998
00:41:19,740 --> 00:41:22,220
I'll like write an amazing book and then kill myself,

999
00:41:22,220 --> 00:41:23,980
or if I'm gonna continue being a Christian

1000
00:41:23,980 --> 00:41:26,220
and wanna get married when I'm 19,

1001
00:41:26,220 --> 00:41:27,900
like this is a current plan.

1002
00:41:27,900 --> 00:41:29,060
- Yeah.

1003
00:41:29,060 --> 00:41:30,660
Well, I think of God, it's like,

1004
00:41:30,660 --> 00:41:35,980
if God is real, how could he let something exist like math?

1005
00:41:35,980 --> 00:41:37,220
- Yeah. - Or cancer.

1006
00:41:37,220 --> 00:41:38,060
- True.

1007
00:41:38,060 --> 00:41:38,900
- Well, no, that's a good point.

1008
00:41:38,900 --> 00:41:40,700
Like math, what is the fucking point of math?

1009
00:41:40,700 --> 00:41:41,540
- What's the reason?

1010
00:41:41,540 --> 00:41:43,060
Like when are you gonna use that?

1011
00:41:43,060 --> 00:41:43,900
- Yeah.

1012
00:41:43,900 --> 00:41:44,740
Like why do I have to do that?

1013
00:41:44,740 --> 00:41:46,060
- Like I'm not gonna do my taxes.

1014
00:41:46,060 --> 00:41:49,100
- They don't even teach us fucking taxes in school, right?

1015
00:41:49,100 --> 00:41:51,300
- And taxes, you don't even have to know math to do that.

1016
00:41:51,300 --> 00:41:52,140
That's letters.

1017
00:41:52,140 --> 00:41:55,140
And if it wasn't for math,

1018
00:41:55,140 --> 00:41:58,940
I would be a sophomore in high school like I should be.

1019
00:41:58,940 --> 00:42:00,940
- Do you guys wanna go to college one day?

1020
00:42:00,940 --> 00:42:02,580
- No, I wanna do a trade.

1021
00:42:02,580 --> 00:42:04,780
- I go to like a party college.

1022
00:42:04,780 --> 00:42:05,620
- Yeah.

1023
00:42:05,620 --> 00:42:07,180
- But I feel like to me,

1024
00:42:07,180 --> 00:42:10,780
like I know that I'm gonna be like a performer.

1025
00:42:10,780 --> 00:42:11,940
- I'm gonna go to school for,

1026
00:42:11,940 --> 00:42:14,680
I'm gonna go to a community college for video production

1027
00:42:14,680 --> 00:42:17,620
and then it's gonna ruin a lot of stuff for me.

1028
00:42:17,620 --> 00:42:20,140
- I really, really wanna go to full sail

1029
00:42:20,140 --> 00:42:20,980
like fucking cat and shit.

1030
00:42:20,980 --> 00:42:21,820
- Yeah, me too.

1031
00:42:21,820 --> 00:42:22,640
- I'm kinda mad as shit.

1032
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:24,340
- 'Cause I do wanna become a vegan.

1033
00:42:24,340 --> 00:42:26,140
- You know what I wish I could go to, though?

1034
00:42:26,140 --> 00:42:27,300
- What?

1035
00:42:27,300 --> 00:42:28,180
- Hogwarts.

1036
00:42:28,180 --> 00:42:29,020
- Hogwarts is not--

1037
00:42:29,020 --> 00:42:31,660
- No, that's a fucking elementary school

1038
00:42:31,660 --> 00:42:33,140
for wizard-ass kids.

1039
00:42:33,140 --> 00:42:35,100
- Yeah, but imagine if I could get held back

1040
00:42:35,100 --> 00:42:36,140
and they're like, "You're being held back.

1041
00:42:36,140 --> 00:42:37,220
"You're going back to first grade."

1042
00:42:37,220 --> 00:42:38,060
And I'd be like, "Fuck, are you shitting me?"

1043
00:42:38,060 --> 00:42:41,060
- Bro said he wants to go to school in a dress every day.

1044
00:42:41,060 --> 00:42:42,220
(laughing)

1045
00:42:42,220 --> 00:42:43,980
- It's a robe.

1046
00:42:43,980 --> 00:42:44,900
It's a cowl.

1047
00:42:44,900 --> 00:42:45,720
It's a--

1048
00:42:45,720 --> 00:42:46,560
- That's what girls say, too.

1049
00:42:46,560 --> 00:42:47,380
- It's a tunic, actually.

1050
00:42:47,380 --> 00:42:48,500
- Mm, I bet it is.

1051
00:42:48,500 --> 00:42:50,260
I think it's definitely easily a dress.

1052
00:42:50,260 --> 00:42:51,700
- It's a tunic. - No.

1053
00:42:51,700 --> 00:42:53,980
- Okay, meanwhile you're wearing a skirt under the table.

1054
00:42:53,980 --> 00:42:55,940
- He wants to hang out with Harry P.

1055
00:42:55,940 --> 00:42:57,540
- Wait, I hear the time clock.

1056
00:42:57,540 --> 00:43:00,140
- Okay, show this though, show this though first.

1057
00:43:00,140 --> 00:43:00,980
- It's 11.

1058
00:43:00,980 --> 00:43:02,580
- It's not 11 yet.

1059
00:43:02,580 --> 00:43:03,900
- It is 11. - It is 11.

1060
00:43:03,900 --> 00:43:05,380
Show this though.

1061
00:43:05,380 --> 00:43:06,660
That's who goes to Hogwarts.

1062
00:43:06,660 --> 00:43:08,340
- Yeah, that's how you wanna dress.

1063
00:43:08,340 --> 00:43:11,340
- No dude, that's who I'll be in.

1064
00:43:11,340 --> 00:43:12,180
- You're gonna fuck that woman's bro.

1065
00:43:12,180 --> 00:43:14,060
- You're gonna be in her dress?

1066
00:43:14,060 --> 00:43:15,100
- Yeah, after I fuck her.

1067
00:43:15,100 --> 00:43:16,300
That's what, boyfriends and girlfriends

1068
00:43:16,300 --> 00:43:17,620
wear their clothes after they fuck.

1069
00:43:17,620 --> 00:43:20,780
That's why they show a woman in a flannel on TV.

1070
00:43:20,780 --> 00:43:22,220
Yeah, and they show a boy in a dress.

1071
00:43:22,220 --> 00:43:22,980
Yeah.

1072
00:43:22,980 --> 00:43:23,780
Did you guys ever--

1073
00:43:23,780 --> 00:43:25,300
I saw a boy in a dress get fucked.

1074
00:43:25,300 --> 00:43:29,020
A woman wears her boyfriend's hoodie, sweatshirt.

1075
00:43:29,020 --> 00:43:30,580
That happens to me basically every day

1076
00:43:30,580 --> 00:43:31,380
when I go to school.

1077
00:43:31,380 --> 00:43:33,020
And a boy wears the tights after.

1078
00:43:33,020 --> 00:43:35,220
I saw a boy in a dress get fucked.

1079
00:43:35,220 --> 00:43:37,700
Do you think if they have a dance at school

1080
00:43:37,700 --> 00:43:39,380
that we'll probably go and we can get blowjobs

1081
00:43:39,380 --> 00:43:39,980
in the bathroom?

1082
00:43:39,980 --> 00:43:41,780
We could be the blowjob crew.

1083
00:43:41,780 --> 00:43:44,140
Yeah.

1084
00:43:44,140 --> 00:43:46,540
We could probably get in serious trouble.

1085
00:43:46,540 --> 00:43:49,340
If we found three girls who would do that together.

1086
00:43:49,340 --> 00:43:53,340
I think I might want to hire a prostitute before I turn 18 to lose my virginity too.

1087
00:43:53,340 --> 00:43:55,340
Yeah, so you don't have to tell any girl that you're...

1088
00:43:55,340 --> 00:43:57,340
Yeah, it should be with a seasoned professional.

1089
00:43:57,340 --> 00:43:58,340
Mm-hmm, exactly.

1090
00:43:58,340 --> 00:43:58,840
Yeah.

1091
00:43:58,840 --> 00:44:01,840
I feel like I want to get it out of the way with a prostitute who, like, whose life doesn't

1092
00:44:01,840 --> 00:44:04,040
matter before I fuck, like, a real girl.

1093
00:44:04,040 --> 00:44:05,840
I'd probably hire, like, Timmy's mom.

1094
00:44:05,840 --> 00:44:07,840
Is she a prostitute or she just looks like a slut?

1095
00:44:07,840 --> 00:44:09,340
She's like, she just, she doesn't have a husband.

1096
00:44:09,340 --> 00:44:09,840
Yeah.

1097
00:44:09,840 --> 00:44:10,840
And she wears no bras on the list.

1098
00:44:10,840 --> 00:44:11,840
She, yeah, and she has no...

1099
00:44:11,840 --> 00:44:12,840
What I heard.

1100
00:44:12,840 --> 00:44:13,840
She always has, she looks pale.

1101
00:44:13,840 --> 00:44:14,840
Yeah.

1102
00:44:14,840 --> 00:44:15,840
But she dresses, I hear that...

1103
00:44:15,840 --> 00:44:18,640
She has a Subaru and I heard that lesbos drive those fucking cars.

1104
00:44:18,640 --> 00:44:22,840
Yeah, that's true. What I heard is that, you know Jason?

1105
00:44:22,840 --> 00:44:23,640
Yeah.

1106
00:44:23,640 --> 00:44:24,340
Momoa?

1107
00:44:24,340 --> 00:44:24,840
No.

1108
00:44:24,840 --> 00:44:25,340
Uh oh.

1109
00:44:25,340 --> 00:44:29,140
Well, Jason's mom and dad have these things called "key parties."

1110
00:44:29,140 --> 00:44:30,840
No fucking way.

1111
00:44:30,840 --> 00:44:36,840
And I know that because my mom came home with Jason's dad.

1112
00:44:36,840 --> 00:44:37,840
Holy shit.

1113
00:44:37,840 --> 00:44:42,840
Well, I know I kind of want to go to a party and I know exactly what could get us into one of those parties.

1114
00:44:42,840 --> 00:44:43,840
Whoa!

1115
00:44:43,840 --> 00:44:46,040
I got a pair of keys right here.

1116
00:44:46,040 --> 00:44:50,940
Wait, so this is basically two tickets to a wild adult party of sexual escapade.

1117
00:44:50,940 --> 00:44:52,440
You have to wear a mask there though.

1118
00:44:52,440 --> 00:44:55,640
Pat, here's a picture of Jason's dad with your mom.

1119
00:44:55,640 --> 00:44:56,940
I thought that COVID was over.

1120
00:44:56,940 --> 00:44:59,040
I didn't know you still had to wear masks to that shit.

1121
00:44:59,040 --> 00:45:02,240
Yeah, no, you have to wear a mask because of the smell.

1122
00:45:02,240 --> 00:45:07,240
Dude, I hate how all these adults nowadays are fucking liberal pussies.

1123
00:45:07,240 --> 00:45:09,440
They wear fucking masks to Starbucks and shit.

1124
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:13,240
I actually like that because of a lot of stuff that Trevor Noah has been telling me.

1125
00:45:13,240 --> 00:45:15,880
You're always on and on about this Trevor Noah motherfucker.

1126
00:45:15,880 --> 00:45:16,640
What about fucking...

1127
00:45:16,640 --> 00:45:18,440
He's the funniest comic right now.

1128
00:45:18,440 --> 00:45:19,640
What about Logan Paul?

1129
00:45:19,640 --> 00:45:20,240
What about...

1130
00:45:20,240 --> 00:45:20,840
Okay, but that...

1131
00:45:20,840 --> 00:45:21,440
I chose to be...

1132
00:45:21,440 --> 00:45:22,640
He's actually fucking fire.

1133
00:45:22,640 --> 00:45:25,340
What's you guys' favorite brand of beer?

1134
00:45:25,340 --> 00:45:26,640
Probably fucking hops.

1135
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:27,640
I like O'Doul's.

1136
00:45:27,640 --> 00:45:28,740
Or schlops.

1137
00:45:28,740 --> 00:45:30,240
Yeah.

1138
00:45:30,240 --> 00:45:30,640
I like vodka.

1139
00:45:30,640 --> 00:45:31,840
I like Smirnoff. It's good.

1140
00:45:31,840 --> 00:45:32,940
Yeah, vodka is best...

1141
00:45:32,940 --> 00:45:33,640
Smirnoff is really good.

1142
00:45:33,640 --> 00:45:35,640
...better than I drink blueberry vodka from the fridge

1143
00:45:35,640 --> 00:45:37,240
and I immediately threw up.

1144
00:45:37,240 --> 00:45:38,240
No, dude.

1145
00:45:38,240 --> 00:45:39,540
That's pussy.

1146
00:45:39,540 --> 00:45:40,240
I honestly...

1147
00:45:40,240 --> 00:45:41,640
I've only had a couple of sips.

1148
00:45:41,640 --> 00:45:43,320
Don't ever tell someone that.

1149
00:45:43,320 --> 00:45:45,880
- I won't do, we're in deep conversation mode here.

1150
00:45:45,880 --> 00:45:47,840
- I've only had a couple of sips, but I don't think--

1151
00:45:47,840 --> 00:45:49,520
- Dude, I'll, wait, all of us really quick.

1152
00:45:49,520 --> 00:45:50,360
- Definitely.

1153
00:45:50,360 --> 00:45:51,360
- This shit is all secret.

1154
00:45:51,360 --> 00:45:52,200
- For sure.

1155
00:45:52,200 --> 00:45:53,020
- We have to keep this under wraps.

1156
00:45:53,020 --> 00:45:54,800
- No one will ever know about what we say.

1157
00:45:54,800 --> 00:45:56,000
- Oh fuck no, dude.

1158
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:56,840
Who's fucking got the biggest--

1159
00:45:56,840 --> 00:45:57,680
- I was fucked.

1160
00:45:57,680 --> 00:46:00,380
- By who?

1161
00:46:00,380 --> 00:46:03,080
- I don't even wanna say anymore.

1162
00:46:03,080 --> 00:46:03,920
- Damn.

1163
00:46:03,920 --> 00:46:05,000
- You don't even wanna say, why?

1164
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:06,160
I wanna know who fucked you.

1165
00:46:06,160 --> 00:46:07,120
Who fucked you?

1166
00:46:07,120 --> 00:46:08,040
You were fucked?

1167
00:46:08,040 --> 00:46:09,640
- When did you get fucked?

1168
00:46:09,640 --> 00:46:11,880
You get fucked on purpose or an accidental fuck?

1169
00:46:11,880 --> 00:46:15,120
You're just lying for attention, aren't you?

1170
00:46:15,120 --> 00:46:15,960
- I got fucked.

1171
00:46:15,960 --> 00:46:18,000
- No you didn't, you're fucking lying for attention.

1172
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:18,840
- No I didn't.

1173
00:46:18,840 --> 00:46:20,000
- This is the most, you keep doing this,

1174
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:22,200
keep saying, oh I fucking got molested.

1175
00:46:22,200 --> 00:46:24,920
- Dude, I got fucked by Jamie Lee Curtis when I was seven.

1176
00:46:24,920 --> 00:46:25,760
- That's fucking a lie, dude.

1177
00:46:25,760 --> 00:46:27,920
- Damn, she was my babysitter.

1178
00:46:27,920 --> 00:46:29,600
- That's a fucking lie.

1179
00:46:29,600 --> 00:46:31,400
She's not a babysitter, she's an actress.

1180
00:46:31,400 --> 00:46:33,400
- Did you ever see the movie where she's a babysitter?

1181
00:46:33,400 --> 00:46:34,240
- Yeah.

1182
00:46:34,240 --> 00:46:35,640
- They hired her for that 'cause she really was a babysitter.

1183
00:46:35,640 --> 00:46:38,640
- That was like 65 years ago, asshat.

1184
00:46:38,640 --> 00:46:40,140
She's in a yogurt commercial.

1185
00:46:40,140 --> 00:46:41,800
Yeah, I bet you made yogurt on her.

1186
00:46:41,800 --> 00:46:42,640
That's how they got the inspiration

1187
00:46:42,640 --> 00:46:43,640
for that commercial too.

1188
00:46:43,640 --> 00:46:46,120
I had a whole lot of sex dreams about her

1189
00:46:46,120 --> 00:46:47,560
a long time ago when I was a kid.

1190
00:46:47,560 --> 00:46:48,520
Yeah? Yeah.

1191
00:46:48,520 --> 00:46:49,960
I wanted to fuck Jamie Lee Curtis

1192
00:46:49,960 --> 00:46:52,280
when I was a kid so bad off them yogurt commercials.

1193
00:46:52,280 --> 00:46:53,120
The yogurt commercials?

1194
00:46:53,120 --> 00:46:54,880
Not even Trading Spaces?

1195
00:46:54,880 --> 00:46:56,040
Trading Spaces.

1196
00:46:56,040 --> 00:46:57,320
She's in that.

1197
00:46:57,320 --> 00:46:58,160
Trading Spaces?

1198
00:46:58,160 --> 00:47:00,000
She shows her butt in that.

1199
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:01,160
Trading Spaces?

1200
00:47:01,160 --> 00:47:01,980
I've never seen that movie.

1201
00:47:01,980 --> 00:47:03,480
With Eddie Murphy and Dan Aykroyd?

1202
00:47:03,480 --> 00:47:04,560
Never seen it.

1203
00:47:04,560 --> 00:47:05,600
I just-- My dad and I would

1204
00:47:05,600 --> 00:47:06,440
watch that on Christmas a lot.

1205
00:47:06,440 --> 00:47:11,000
I honestly I saw Freaky Friday and the yogurt commercial. I was like 10 years old

1206
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:13,160
I was like I have to fuck Jamie Lee Curtis

1207
00:47:13,160 --> 00:47:13,480
Yeah

1208
00:47:13,480 --> 00:47:16,560
I never saw any of the stuff when she was a young hot lady and then I saw

1209
00:47:16,560 --> 00:47:22,740
The one she did with Arnold where she does a sexy strip tease and I was like she looks too young

1210
00:47:22,740 --> 00:47:32,020
It's too young in those movies guys I something to admit yeah, I was lying when I said I got fuck yeah

1211
00:47:32,020 --> 00:47:34,240
We knew so I but when I was 10

1212
00:47:35,120 --> 00:47:39,680
Megan Fox called me and brought me to the set of Transformers and brought me to her trailer and fuck damn

1213
00:47:39,680 --> 00:47:44,740
Lying I was lying it was actually the girl in Transformers dark of the moon

1214
00:47:44,740 --> 00:47:49,840
They replaced her with the rose honey. Do we the British one? I fucking hated her. She's annoying as fuck well

1215
00:47:49,840 --> 00:47:52,160
She fucked me, and now we don't talk damn

1216
00:47:52,160 --> 00:47:58,220
Do you guys think that you guys could have casual sex one day or is it all

1217
00:47:58,220 --> 00:48:03,960
That's how I feel - I makes me throw up thinking that people have casual sex

1218
00:48:03,960 --> 00:48:10,580
Yeah, I really wish I could get on tinder though. I kind of want to check out all of the fucking sex apps and

1219
00:48:10,580 --> 00:48:16,640
I want to get I think it'll be so fucking hot if I could stay up all night looking at bumble

1220
00:48:16,640 --> 00:48:21,600
Yeah, dude, imagine what girls post on there. Probably they post their pussies on that

1221
00:48:21,600 --> 00:48:24,840
It's probably you're just swiping left and right on pictures of vaginas

1222
00:48:24,840 --> 00:48:27,880
I would swipe right on everything on hinge bumble and tinder

1223
00:48:27,880 --> 00:48:31,600
You guys ever gone chat roulette and show your underage penis get people sent to jail

1224
00:48:31,600 --> 00:48:41,200
We used to do that so much when I was a kid. We'd go on chatrelite and be like, if it was

1225
00:48:41,200 --> 00:48:46,000
an adult we'd immediately show our dick and balls.

1226
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:48,400
That's funny. Yeah, I did that on Reddit.

1227
00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:51,520
No, you didn't, because I would get taken down. But chatrelite you can't get banned because

1228
00:48:51,520 --> 00:48:53,640
it's actually decentralized on the blockchain.

1229
00:48:53,640 --> 00:48:54,640
For real?

1230
00:48:54,640 --> 00:48:55,640
I don't know, something like that.

1231
00:48:55,640 --> 00:48:58,400
What do you guys think it will be like in 50 years?

1232
00:48:58,400 --> 00:49:04,960
Probably an unimaginable hellscape of fucking fire and flames. Do you guys think it will be go back to the moon?

1233
00:49:04,960 --> 00:49:09,340
I think probably the rapture will start by then yeah the rapper you think the Rapture is gonna start

1234
00:49:09,340 --> 00:49:14,340
No, it's actually because of some oil fucking company. I fucking hate the oil companies. Yeah, yeah

1235
00:49:14,340 --> 00:49:20,720
Wait, what's what's what Trevor Noah taught oil Michael Moore make Michael Moore movies? I like my mom fries vegetables in oil

1236
00:49:20,720 --> 00:49:25,600
What kind of vegetables? I did not just admit that what the fuck did you just say about vegetables?

1237
00:49:26,120 --> 00:49:29,360
You mean you mean vegetables like I mean eggs

1238
00:49:29,360 --> 00:49:31,680
Okay

1239
00:49:31,680 --> 00:49:33,680
I'm gonna do one more truth or dare

1240
00:49:33,680 --> 00:49:37,440
Cuz I just want I just want to do you guys want to do just do more truth or dare

1241
00:49:37,440 --> 00:49:42,240
Do you guys want to okay Pat? Do you want extreme and hot? Yes? Okay? Do you want truth or dare truth?

1242
00:49:42,240 --> 00:49:49,200
Okay, dare you already said it's truthful that I what is something that is absolutely off-limits in the bat

1243
00:49:49,200 --> 00:49:52,120
Beth in the bedroom not the bathroom the bath bath bedroom

1244
00:49:52,520 --> 00:49:56,920
Something that's off-limits in the bathroom is walking in on me jacking off mom

1245
00:49:56,920 --> 00:50:08,120
Enough guys everywhere in the house

1246
00:50:08,120 --> 00:50:10,800
Now for us what's that?

1247
00:50:10,800 --> 00:50:15,240
So we love to jack off in the bathroom or bedroom and we oh, yeah, and we hate when someone walks in

1248
00:50:15,240 --> 00:50:17,240
Oh, you know at the convenience store

1249
00:50:17,240 --> 00:50:21,240
they have a monitor where everyone can see what's happening at every part of the store.

1250
00:50:21,240 --> 00:50:22,240
No.

1251
00:50:22,240 --> 00:50:24,240
And they show a security camera footage.

1252
00:50:24,240 --> 00:50:27,240
They should have one of those on the outside of the bathroom so that someone can look on the outside

1253
00:50:27,240 --> 00:50:30,240
and if they see someone jacking off, they won't go in.

1254
00:50:30,240 --> 00:50:32,240
Yeah, or you could get a baby monitor.

1255
00:50:32,240 --> 00:50:34,240
Yeah, and then you do it like this.

1256
00:50:34,240 --> 00:50:37,240
And then you moan into the baby monitor.

1257
00:50:37,240 --> 00:50:39,240
That's what I do when I jack off.

1258
00:50:39,240 --> 00:50:41,240
And I jack off like this.

1259
00:50:41,240 --> 00:50:43,240
I rub the bottom like this.

1260
00:50:43,240 --> 00:50:45,240
Why? How does that do crap?

1261
00:50:45,240 --> 00:50:47,240
You're still learning, kiddo.

1262
00:50:47,240 --> 00:50:51,240
If you want jack off lessons, you should take them from the master.

1263
00:50:51,240 --> 00:50:53,240
It's like this when I do it. I go like...

1264
00:50:53,240 --> 00:50:57,240
You put the baby monitor under your mom's pillow.

1265
00:50:57,240 --> 00:50:58,240
Yeah.

1266
00:50:58,240 --> 00:51:01,240
And then you just scream and moan loud as fuck.

1267
00:51:01,240 --> 00:51:07,240
Also, sometimes I put a napkin around my junk and I go like this.

1268
00:51:07,240 --> 00:51:11,240
And I go like this.

1269
00:51:11,240 --> 00:51:14,240
I read an urban dictionary that's called the Rocketeer.

1270
00:51:14,240 --> 00:51:18,080
here. Yeah. What's your favorite urban? Wait, actually, I think the clock just

1271
00:51:18,080 --> 00:51:20,840
ticked. It's actually called a restaurant. Wait, I think we're one

1272
00:51:20,840 --> 00:51:24,200
minute away from midnight. Wait, are we actually? I think we are. I think it's

1273
00:51:24,200 --> 00:51:30,120
1159. Holy crap. Guys, I can't believe we almost did it. I know, but they know

1274
00:51:30,120 --> 00:51:34,440
you know how they say that time slows down the more they do. Yeah. Yeah. So I

1275
00:51:34,440 --> 00:51:38,920
don't know. Do you guys? I'm just joking. You guys want to play more truth or

1276
00:51:38,920 --> 00:51:41,480
dare, though, because I really like truth. Let's play more truth or dare.

1277
00:51:41,480 --> 00:51:45,120
Okay, wait. No, you, hey, hey. You asked Patrick one, so now it's Patrick's turn.

1278
00:51:45,120 --> 00:51:45,640
I'm the truth or master.

1279
00:51:45,640 --> 00:51:46,440
No, you are not.

1280
00:51:46,440 --> 00:51:49,480
I also can't press the button because it doesn't work on my phone.

1281
00:51:49,480 --> 00:51:55,240
Here, you can use my phone. I'm letting you. So you choose someone to ask. Who are you

1282
00:51:55,240 --> 00:51:55,760
going to ask?

1283
00:51:55,760 --> 00:52:00,040
Can I ask myself?

1284
00:52:00,040 --> 00:52:01,000
Okay.

1285
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:02,440
Okay.

1286
00:52:02,440 --> 00:52:06,200
What? Ask yourself. I've never heard of that, but I guess you can do that.

1287
00:52:06,200 --> 00:52:07,880
You can do it, but I don't like it though.

1288
00:52:08,320 --> 00:52:12,760
Okay, I dare myself to brush my spouse's teeth.

1289
00:52:12,760 --> 00:52:15,840
No, you can't ask yourself.

1290
00:52:15,840 --> 00:52:18,160
Okay, then I dare you to brush your spouse's teeth.

1291
00:52:18,160 --> 00:52:20,600
We're playing footsie under the table.

1292
00:52:20,600 --> 00:52:21,440
No, give me--

00:52:21,440 --> 00:52:22,280

Wait, what difficulty though?

1297

Extreme and hot.

1298
00:52:26,280 --> 00:52:27,280
We only do extreme and hot.

1299
00:52:27,280 --> 00:52:28,840
Okay, okay, that's true 'cause it's late.

1300
00:52:28,840 --> 00:52:29,680

You never shave.

1366
00:55:12,680 --> 00:55:13,500
Pat, give me your hand or your arm.

1367
00:55:13,500 --> 00:55:14,340
You can tell.

1368
00:55:14,340 --> 00:55:15,860
I'll shave a little bit of your arm.

1369
00:55:15,860 --> 00:55:16,700
Shave the tip of your finger.

1370
00:55:16,700 --> 00:55:17,540
No, no, no, no.

1371
00:55:17,540 --> 00:55:18,360
Shave my knuckle right here.

1372
00:55:18,360 --> 00:55:19,340
I'll shave your hand.

1373
00:55:19,340 --> 00:55:20,420
Okay.

1374
00:55:20,420 --> 00:55:21,620
No, wait, don't shave my knuckle.

1375
00:55:21,620 --> 00:55:23,460
Wait, it's not my dare.

1376
00:55:23,460 --> 00:55:24,540
I'll shave my arm.

1377
00:55:24,540 --> 00:55:33,900
It doesn't even hurt and it doesn't look that weird.

1378
00:55:33,900 --> 00:55:35,300
That looks so painful.

1379
00:55:35,300 --> 00:55:37,300
See look at that.

1380
00:55:37,300 --> 00:55:38,300
Hold that up.

1381
00:55:38,300 --> 00:55:42,500
I just took some hair off my arm.

1382
00:55:42,500 --> 00:55:44,700
I guess you can't see it.

1383
00:55:44,700 --> 00:55:47,340
See that's why we need to use your hair because you have black cast hair.

1384
00:55:47,340 --> 00:55:48,660
You have no hair at all.

1385
00:55:48,660 --> 00:55:49,820
This would not affect you.

1386
00:55:49,820 --> 00:55:50,820
No I'm scared.

1387
00:55:50,820 --> 00:55:51,820
Let's shave your arm Pat.

1388
00:55:51,820 --> 00:55:52,820
Come on.

1389
00:55:52,820 --> 00:55:56,740
My arm right here, it'll look weird because I mean I have so much of it that

1390
00:55:56,740 --> 00:55:58,740
Shaved his costume

1391
00:55:58,740 --> 00:56:06,740
Nothing came off. Yeah, it's too thick. Actually we got a little bit

1392
00:56:06,740 --> 00:56:18,620
You got fucking owned. Okay. Your shit, your arm's been shaved into a square

1393
00:56:18,620 --> 00:56:32,140
You look awesome.

1394
00:56:32,140 --> 00:56:33,340
No!

1395
00:56:33,340 --> 00:56:34,740
Get away from me!

1396
00:56:34,740 --> 00:56:35,740
Get away from me!

1397
00:56:35,740 --> 00:56:38,020
What are you doing?

1398
00:56:38,020 --> 00:56:39,020
My hands are already shaved!

1399
00:56:39,020 --> 00:56:41,020
Guys, don't fight.

1400
00:56:41,020 --> 00:56:42,180
Stop!

1401
00:56:42,180 --> 00:56:44,460
Get away from me!

1402
00:56:44,460 --> 00:56:46,060
Get that away and I'll fuck you up!

1403
00:56:46,060 --> 00:56:48,500
I'll fucking call the cops right now!

1404
00:56:48,500 --> 00:56:50,500
Call them, call them, call them!

1405
00:56:50,500 --> 00:56:54,500
I'm fucking serious, I'll shave the fucking cops' heads!

1406
00:56:54,500 --> 00:56:58,500
Don't you ever fucking try to shave me ever again!

1407
00:56:58,500 --> 00:57:02,500
That was bullshit, and you fucking know it.

1408
00:57:02,500 --> 00:57:03,500
You shaved me!

1409
00:57:03,500 --> 00:57:06,500
I did it as a part of his dare, you asshat.

1410
00:57:06,500 --> 00:57:07,500
Guys?

1411
00:57:07,500 --> 00:57:08,500
What?

1412
00:57:08,500 --> 00:57:09,500
Can we be friends again?

1413
00:57:09,500 --> 00:57:11,500
Yes, truth or dare?

1414
00:57:11,500 --> 00:57:13,500
Because you didn't even do your dare.

1415
00:57:13,500 --> 00:57:14,500
Okay, a new dare.

1416
00:57:14,500 --> 00:57:16,500
He has not done a single dare, so he gets a triple dare.

1417
00:57:16,500 --> 00:57:17,500
Just the triple dare.

1418
00:57:17,500 --> 00:57:18,500
I'm scared of dares.

1419
00:57:18,500 --> 00:57:20,420
Do something funny that only your spouse will understand.

1420
00:57:20,420 --> 00:57:23,460
You don't have a spouse or you know you're fucking forever alone.

1421
00:57:23,460 --> 00:57:27,060
Pour some sauce on your mobile screen and make a video call to someone.

1422
00:57:27,060 --> 00:57:29,980
After she lifts the call, lick the sauce.

1423
00:57:29,980 --> 00:57:34,220
Do you have any sauce?

1424
00:57:34,220 --> 00:57:35,220
Okay, hold on.

1425
00:57:35,220 --> 00:57:36,220
Maybe I can put a chip.

1426
00:57:36,220 --> 00:57:37,220
I can put some sauce.

1427
00:57:37,220 --> 00:57:39,900
You can put a chip but you gotta make a- Can I eat the chip off of the screen?

1428
00:57:39,900 --> 00:57:40,900
Yeah, sure.

1429
00:57:40,900 --> 00:57:41,900
We'll count that.

1430
00:57:41,900 --> 00:57:46,460
Okay, let me pull up- Let me pull up the FaceTime app here that I have on my iPod 10.

1433
00:57:56,680 --> 00:58:02,440
Who you calling you accept the terms and conditions? I think that's how it works blockhead. Oh

1434
00:58:02,440 --> 00:58:05,340

Okay wait, make sure it's really closed though.

1447

Because I don't like spills.

1448
00:58:53,340 --> 00:58:55,340
My mom would fucking kill me.

1449
00:58:55,340 --> 00:58:57,340
