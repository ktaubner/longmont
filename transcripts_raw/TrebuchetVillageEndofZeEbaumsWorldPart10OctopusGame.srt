00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Last time on Trebuchet Village, end of Zeebom's World,

3
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:29,000
our heroes, down to two, met a valuable third in Chuggie, the Changeling, the Singing Submarine.

4
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
I was dictating this.

5
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
I was dictating this.

6
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Then I stopped.

7
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:41,080
the confines of potential pervert and certain murderer Flint Lateralis, Chuggie was happy

8
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:49,240
to accompany Dogen and Evil on their quest to "vibe" the Quadro Mudmarks. Or perhaps,

9
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:55,400
'tis more accurate to say they were glad to accompany Chuggie, because after all, he is a

10
00:00:55,400 --> 00:01:02,440
rare changeling who took the magical herb Percocet and forever became a real working submarine,

11
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:06,680
at least when he's not shapeshifting, with a periscope made of congealed hair,

12
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:11,960
Pixar-style eyes for front windows, and he shits out his exhaust and he is gross inside.

13
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:17,640
The now undersea adventure began with an ill-fated encounter with some rubbers,

14
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:21,880
who weren't interested in living up to their namesake as workers at the sex factory,

15
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:26,760
which I was reminded was honestly pretty dope, and they get to have tons of sex with babes.

16
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:27,320
An honor.

17
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:30,680
It was less about the thing, it's not about having sex with babes necessarily,

18
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:31,720
it's more about reproduction.

19
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:33,320
the factory monitor

20
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:34,900
it's

21
00:01:34,900 --> 00:01:35,960
citizens

22
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:39,880
like six in a story i actually i don't really what's wrong with what's right

23
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:43,460
just with sex proceeding a sex factory is fucking dole

24
00:01:43,460 --> 00:01:46,360
well i don't know that there's a problem i was saying i was wrong this was me

25
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:50,120
this is a mea culpa it was a generational gap i think we'll talk about

26
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:54,820
that yes that's got generated by the on views on reproductive rights yeah yeah

27
00:01:54,820 --> 00:01:57,480
patches is twenty thirty years older than that

28
00:01:57,480 --> 00:01:59,840
is true is yes

29
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:00,920
he's in his mid-fifties

30
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:02,320
so he's just not

31
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:04,760
all the way up to a yes i doesn't

32
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:06,920
doesn't know what's what's right now

33
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:09,760
so chuggies we talked away those robbers

34
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:13,120
and they continued on their journey

35
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:19,480
then you guys uh... chose to ignore reused asset from a prior game

36
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:23,280
which had a different thing going on yeah i know i fucking believe that

37
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:26,600
with the fleet but he can't say what it was actually are for you i could say

38
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:29,060
what it was yes it was it was a

39
00:02:29,060 --> 00:02:31,400
magical tried yes if you pulled it out

40
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:34,960
was also stock underneath some volcanic rocks he would have taken some damage

41
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:38,640
those magical trident would've begun a little encounter with a merfolk

42
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:42,400
adventure who was looking for it was in a beast was not a beast

43
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:43,040
so we got

44
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:44,680
fought by not doing

45
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:48,580
no i mean it was still a risk to do it big star man

46
00:02:48,580 --> 00:02:52,100
well yes and then then you had to deal with them

47
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:53,620
What's the name of that thing?

48
00:02:53,620 --> 00:02:58,220
So I've been going through some names in my head.

49
00:02:58,220 --> 00:03:02,080
Right now I've settled on the winged predatorium.

50
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:03,080
The winged predatorium.

51
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:06,660
It's kind of like planetarium, but it's a predator.

52
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:07,660
Predatorium.

53
00:03:07,660 --> 00:03:08,660
Predatorium.

54
00:03:08,660 --> 00:03:09,660
Predatorium maybe I guess.

55
00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:10,660
Predatorium.

56
00:03:10,660 --> 00:03:11,660
We have winged predatorium.

57
00:03:11,660 --> 00:03:12,660
Nigel.

58
00:03:12,660 --> 00:03:15,080
How about chicken little?

59
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:16,080
Chicken little is pretty...

60
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:17,080
Chicken big.

61
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:18,700
Chicken big, yeah.

62
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:19,700
Chicken big, that's pretty...

63
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:20,700
Poultry.

64
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:21,700
Mine is cool.

65
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:28,700
you're a loser I guess but I like yours a lot. Chicken Big.

66
00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:33,300
And it has a chicken's face. That's better. That's a retcon. That would be good if it

67
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:36,540
was called Chicken Big it should have a chicken's face. Okay finish the intro.

68
00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:41,220
A beast that preys on sailors who navigate by the stars. Luckily our heroes

69
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:45,140
were in a submarine and knew to dash quickly under the sea using loud noises

70
00:03:45,140 --> 00:03:47,780
to sartle the beast until Chuggy could dash away.

71
00:03:47,780 --> 00:03:48,940
(burps)

72
00:03:48,940 --> 00:03:49,780
- Whoa.

73
00:03:49,780 --> 00:03:51,620
- Holy fuck, I'm sorry.

74
00:03:51,620 --> 00:03:54,460
- That's a possession right there.

75
00:03:54,460 --> 00:03:57,660
- It has been three days of uneventful travel since,

76
00:03:57,660 --> 00:03:59,700
as Chuggy hugs the knife's coast,

77
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:01,860
entering the seas by the dirtlands.

78
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:06,380
So, you guys have been going down the coast

79
00:04:06,380 --> 00:04:09,800
towards Beriberi, if you recall the map.

80
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:15,020
Now only a week away from Port Loseberry,

81
00:04:15,020 --> 00:04:20,380
our adventure may at last find some solid ground

82
00:04:20,380 --> 00:04:21,780
uh...

83
00:04:21,780 --> 00:04:27,180
uh... anyway so yeah what it was the last three days of the on a mental travel so

84
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:30,260
and ninety nine bottles of beer on the wall

85
00:04:30,260 --> 00:04:32,140
ninety nine bottles of beer

86
00:04:32,140 --> 00:04:34,620
you were going to ask what he was singing?

87
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:39,020
I was going to ask what you guys were up to during that time

88
00:04:39,020 --> 00:04:43,940
I had my head stuck in his flesh just to close my ears

89
00:04:43,940 --> 00:04:58,460
the

90
00:04:58,460 --> 00:05:05,460
you

91
00:05:05,460 --> 00:05:07,100
you know yes I'm not underwater

92
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:09,900
do I see you do you ever go could you go up above and go I'll

93
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:13,100
I'll go up. You find like a small island or something? Yeah. You have to chart it.

94
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:13,820
An isla.

95
00:05:13,820 --> 00:05:17,140
He has to be a hut. I still have to be inside this fucking guy? No no no no.

96
00:05:17,140 --> 00:05:18,540
It's a spell. It's a spell.

97
00:05:18,540 --> 00:05:21,580
It's a spell. He can cast a spell. There could be a hut.

98
00:05:21,580 --> 00:05:25,580
Well I'm a pretty big like how many feet what did I say I was like 30 feet.

99
00:05:25,580 --> 00:05:28,940
You're huge. Yeah. In your submarine form. Yeah.

100
00:05:28,940 --> 00:05:32,500
So that hut would have to be pretty big huh? Well unless you transform unless you

101
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:35,300
shape-shift back into like a humanoid form. To use the hut I have to

102
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:42,300
a

103
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:47,000
It doesn't have to be maybe we could put out and then have football games that we can bet on as a source of gold

104
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,840
that's

105
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:54,140
Insane it's not a bad idea, but no you'd have to you could pick a humanoid character

106
00:05:54,140 --> 00:05:59,780
It doesn't have to be one of your I think I'm just gonna because if I put my blowhole above the water

107
00:05:59,780 --> 00:06:04,980
That'll be fine. Yeah, you could just live that way. Yeah, you could make the hut for I'm gonna do that for right now

108
00:06:04,980 --> 00:06:08,100
Okay, and so that he's gonna put a hut on top of his body

109
00:06:08,820 --> 00:06:14,640
No, no on top not on top of the island or on top of your body. Where did you where what is happening?

110
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:17,760
I'm just trying to figure out how you sleep because you probably have to sleep at some point

111
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:22,700
I just there's a submarine sleep and go big guy. Yeah, well cuz I said he's a guy

112
00:06:22,700 --> 00:06:28,800
No, he's not. He's I have an autopilot mechanism. You have no no pilot. Yeah, it's like he's like a shark

113
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:33,400
He's got us keep moving that I sleep slowly goes that I like. Yeah problem solved

114
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:38,240
So he just you just like your eyes just like roll back. Yeah, just like

115
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:42,240
as you're like sort of me me me

116
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:46,240
snoring underwater me me me me me me me me

117
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:48,240
interesting command on physics

118
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:50,240
I love to snore

119
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:52,240
they don't have a very good command on physics

120
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:54,240
that's a good point

121
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:56,240
ok yeah I was trying to figure out what have you guys been

122
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:58,240
so you guys have been traveling along

123
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:00,240
I'm playing cards with a tapeworm

124
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:02,240
with a tapeworm?

125
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:06,240
I'm ranking how good tasting every part of Chuggy's body is

126
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:07,760
What's the ranking right now?

127
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:08,760
His butt is number one.

128
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:09,760
Oh, that tickles!

129
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:10,760
Awesome.

130
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:14,240
We're going to begin some underwater encounters.

131
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:16,240
Thank you.

132
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:18,800
Who said that?

133
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:19,800
Which one of you guys said that?

134
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:20,800
Who the heck said that?

135
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:23,800
Oh man, we're having a little...

136
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:26,800
Oh, this is not the right side of dice.

137
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:27,800
Bruh.

138
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:28,880
What you looking for?

139
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:30,620
You seem so lackadaisical today.

140
00:07:30,620 --> 00:07:31,620
Your heart's not in this.

141
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:32,620
My heart is totally...

142
00:07:32,620 --> 00:07:34,480
You need to drink the rest of Diet Coke right now.

143
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:35,480
I will drink it.

144
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:36,280
I will, alright.

145
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:39,880
You already led to one of the worst burps I've ever heard, but I wanna hear the second one.

146
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:41,680
I wanna hear what's the next level, yeah.

147
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:42,180
Yeah.

148
00:07:42,180 --> 00:07:43,680
Wish I should've gotten Diet Coke before.

149
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:45,480
No, I got a Yerba before this.

150
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:46,680
You had a Yerba before this?

151
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:47,180
Yeah.

152
00:07:47,180 --> 00:07:48,580
You're a fucking psycho.

153
00:07:48,580 --> 00:07:50,580
Yeah, that's crazy.

154
00:07:50,580 --> 00:07:52,380
I had some water.

155
00:07:52,380 --> 00:07:53,980
Oh my god.

156
00:07:53,980 --> 00:07:55,080
It hurts to drink Diet Coke.

157
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:57,180
Why are you saying that in a Jamaican accent?

158
00:07:57,180 --> 00:07:59,180
I can't drink all these right now, man.

159
00:07:59,180 --> 00:08:01,680
Diet Coke in your throat, Billy!

160
00:08:05,180 --> 00:08:09,100
Okay, that's a fun one. All right, cool. It's a fun one it is

161
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:13,220
So

162
00:08:13,220 --> 00:08:20,980
Come on tell us it's Spongebob. Fuck you man. It's wait. Can we really?

163
00:08:20,980 --> 00:08:26,220
Right, we'll let him finish it could be squidward

164
00:08:26,220 --> 00:08:30,020
Did you guys hear that yes a dog

165
00:08:30,020 --> 00:08:32,300
so

166
00:08:32,300 --> 00:08:34,300
yeah, you guys are swimming along and

167
00:08:34,940 --> 00:08:41,440
You see, I guess Chuggie really, you would catch your eye, or one of your two huge eyes,

168
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:46,440
where you would see a sort of a faint glow below you.

169
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:50,440
Not below the, you know, like the pressure sea level,

170
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:55,940
but this sort of like, just faint, like reddish glow, kind of like flashing in and out.

171
00:08:55,940 --> 00:09:01,440
And you would see that it's coming from some kind of like scaly looking man.

172
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:04,640

I'm not a whale. I'm a submarine

193
00:10:46,420 --> 00:10:50,920
What what's a submarine? It's a thing I made up

194
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:53,060
well

195
00:10:53,060 --> 00:10:54,620
Okay, I

00:10:54,620 --> 00:10:57,100
Need your help with what I?

197
00:10:57,100 --> 00:11:01,720
am trying to summon a crackin a cracker a

198
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:06,160
Crackin you're summoning a cracker a crackin

199
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:10,400
If you're summoning a cracker you could just go to Applebee's, honey

200
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:15,540
What what's Applebee's

201
00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:17,700
It's something I made up

202
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:22,220
Well, you're just full of surprises. I'm full of people right now

203
00:11:23,020 --> 00:11:29,420
He looks and he sees in the two window. I'm doing I'm like pushing my face against the side of his body. So you see

204
00:11:29,420 --> 00:11:33,380
Like a imprint of our face. Yeah, I'm doing the same thing. Yeah

205
00:11:33,380 --> 00:11:37,100
Then I'll eat you too if you don't do it

206
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:43,380
He's gonna think he ate all your gold. I don't have much give me it all

207
00:11:43,380 --> 00:11:48,560
He starts waving his staff faster and faster. I was kidding

208
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:51,540
Okay, roll

209
00:11:51,540 --> 00:11:53,540
persuasion

210
00:11:53,540 --> 00:11:59,420
14 no so I I did that you have plus 10

211
00:11:59,420 --> 00:12:05,780
You keep talking what so that's a 20 you've plus 10. Yeah, I mean

212
00:12:05,780 --> 00:12:10,580
So what I did wrong is you get both your proficiency

213
00:12:10,580 --> 00:12:20,100
So anything that I have a plus the parents actually attend not everything

214
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:22,100
Certain stats you get another bonus

215
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:25,780
Unimportant. Yeah, do I get anything like that character sheet?

216
00:12:25,780 --> 00:12:30,780
What do you have that no because part of being a bard is having like insanely good

217
00:12:30,780 --> 00:12:34,400
You have mad skills bro

218
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:40,300
Skills to pay the bills. She so that is a 20. Yeah, so shizzle so he says

219
00:12:40,300 --> 00:12:45,060
You're gonna have to do that math every time that that happens. No, I'm gonna pull up the

220
00:12:45,060 --> 00:12:49,580
Math sounds difficult. I wouldn't want to have to do plus six multiple times

221
00:12:49,580 --> 00:12:56,580
I'm pulling up the sheet. It's not plus six. It's plus ten. Oh shit. That's even harder.

222
00:12:56,580 --> 00:12:57,580
That's so difficult!

223
00:12:57,580 --> 00:12:58,580
Oh, I'm sorry, I'm wrong.

224
00:12:58,580 --> 00:12:59,580
It's more. It's higher numbers.

225
00:12:59,580 --> 00:13:02,580
You actually have plus seven, but still seventeen.

226
00:13:02,580 --> 00:13:04,580
Oh, he did fuck the math up!

227
00:13:04,580 --> 00:13:07,580
You have performance ten and deception ten.

228
00:13:07,580 --> 00:13:11,580
Because that's like your two skills you have expertise on.

229
00:13:11,580 --> 00:13:15,580
But you have plus seven on persuasion. I don't know why I didn't add proficiency bonus on that. I should have.

230
00:13:15,580 --> 00:13:19,740
But anyway, so characters fucking four feet tall bro. You're a dwarf

231
00:13:19,740 --> 00:13:23,880
So he says um, where does it say you're okay?

232
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:26,340
well

233
00:13:26,340 --> 00:13:30,820
If you're not gonna eat me then and you're not gonna help me then why don't you just move along?

234
00:13:30,820 --> 00:13:35,140
Though I will say if you help me summon this cracker

235
00:13:35,140 --> 00:13:40,980
There's more gold than you can even imagine. Okay, I'm gonna do and power. Oh

236
00:13:40,980 --> 00:13:45,140
I remember when I was just can you shut up? Okay

237
00:13:45,140 --> 00:13:47,140
What are you gonna do with it?

238
00:13:47,140 --> 00:13:49,140
I said I'll do it!

239
00:13:49,140 --> 00:13:51,140
Okay, okay. Then come. Come swim here.

240
00:13:51,140 --> 00:13:53,140
Any uh, uh...

241
00:13:53,140 --> 00:13:57,140
If you want me to come, you're gonna have to buy me dinner first.

242
00:13:57,140 --> 00:13:59,140
What?

243
00:13:59,140 --> 00:14:01,140
I don't know!

244
00:14:01,140 --> 00:14:03,140
I'm teetering on gay boys!

245
00:14:03,140 --> 00:14:05,140
Yeah, we're calling that teetering.

246
00:14:05,140 --> 00:14:11,140
Um, yeah, so yeah, you swim over towards him and offer.

247
00:14:11,140 --> 00:14:13,140
Yeah, you offer. Do you have...

248
00:14:13,140 --> 00:14:15,140
I have little fins.

249
00:14:15,140 --> 00:14:16,140
I was just trying to...

250
00:14:16,140 --> 00:14:17,140
You do?

251
00:14:17,140 --> 00:14:18,140
No, I have full arms.

252
00:14:18,140 --> 00:14:19,140
Wait, hang on.

253
00:14:19,140 --> 00:14:20,140
I have full...

254
00:14:20,140 --> 00:14:21,140
Like, Michael Phelps arms.

255
00:14:21,140 --> 00:14:22,140
Michael Phelps arms.

256
00:14:22,140 --> 00:14:23,140
Yeah.

257
00:14:23,140 --> 00:14:25,140
That just, you do the breaststroke?

258
00:14:25,140 --> 00:14:26,140
Yeah, and legs.

259
00:14:26,140 --> 00:14:27,140
Wow.

260
00:14:27,140 --> 00:14:28,140
What?

261
00:14:28,140 --> 00:14:29,140
You're not a submarine then.

262
00:14:29,140 --> 00:14:30,140
I thought you had a propeller.

263
00:14:30,140 --> 00:14:31,140
Can we just use your...

264
00:14:31,140 --> 00:14:32,140
You have a fleshy propeller.

265
00:14:32,140 --> 00:14:35,140
But I have full arms.

266
00:14:35,140 --> 00:14:36,140
But...

267
00:14:36,140 --> 00:14:38,060
But they pop out maybe?

268
00:14:38,060 --> 00:14:39,060
My hands look like this.

269
00:14:39,060 --> 00:14:40,580
You have rock and roll hands.

270
00:14:40,580 --> 00:14:41,580
You've got rock and roll hands.

271
00:14:41,580 --> 00:14:44,660
It's like, yeah, so imagine my middle finger.

272
00:14:44,660 --> 00:14:49,500
ring and my middle finger are gone on the hand. So you have three fingers. I will say that

273
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:54,540
they are like anchor arms because you can't do combat with them. Anchor arms? Squidward

274
00:14:54,540 --> 00:15:01,540
tentacles? Spongebob? Alright, you've never seen Spongebob, I'm convinced. Spongebob?

275
00:15:01,540 --> 00:15:08,540
You've never seen him? You actually are an old man. What's that called, Spongebob? He's

276
00:15:08,540 --> 00:15:10,540
He's one of them Pokeymans!

277
00:15:10,540 --> 00:15:14,540
Yeah, he's got a friend, he's under... the water?

278
00:15:14,540 --> 00:15:17,540
Who's that character from Spongebob, that blue one, Kwanzaa?

279
00:15:17,540 --> 00:15:18,540
Kwanzaa here?

280
00:15:18,540 --> 00:15:20,540
Kwanzaa!

281
00:15:20,540 --> 00:15:21,540
Kwanzaa!

282
00:15:21,540 --> 00:15:24,540
That blackfella, Squidward!

283
00:15:24,540 --> 00:15:28,540
He's got the shaved head!

284
00:15:28,540 --> 00:15:32,540
That's the only guys I see do that.

285
00:15:32,540 --> 00:15:35,540
Squidward is black-coated, and we're here for it.

286
00:15:35,540 --> 00:15:42,540
So, yeah, you swim down, you offer one of your weird arms, he takes it, and Squanza starts

287
00:15:42,540 --> 00:15:44,100
waving his staff around.

288
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:49,100
He says, "Oh, great Kraken, come to me!

289
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:53,260
Come and bless our lives with your presence!

290
00:15:53,260 --> 00:15:56,300
Be the Kaiju Manji that we've always need!"

291
00:15:56,300 --> 00:16:00,020
I didn't finish writing this, and then he waves it around.

292
00:16:00,020 --> 00:16:03,140
It is like a spell, it is powerful, and you can tell.

293
00:16:03,140 --> 00:16:06,920
what comes out of the spell and it's powerful and you can tell it comes out

294
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:15,460
of the ether is not a kraken but it is a it is a huge shark that just rams right

295
00:16:15,460 --> 00:16:20,740
into squanza he's gonna take some damage why did we wait we knew he's summoning a

296
00:16:20,740 --> 00:16:24,580
crack but he said we get a bunch of gold but we didn't have anything to anything

297
00:16:24,580 --> 00:16:29,980
I say I'm the thing yeah there's all Patrick no fuck told us it's a fun one

298
00:16:29,980 --> 00:16:43,020
I'm in front for you too I'm having some amount of fun

299
00:16:43,020 --> 00:16:49,700
there we go actually okay that is for now

300
00:16:49,700 --> 00:16:58,820
dead what's is not dead can he come into the submarine yeah I mean he got hit by

301
00:16:58,820 --> 00:17:01,500
by the shark and he says, "Help me! Help me!"

302
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:04,140
And so we're gonna roll initiative now for you.

303
00:17:04,140 --> 00:17:05,380
I mean, you guys can roll initiative too,

304
00:17:05,380 --> 00:17:07,180
if you want to determine just general turn order.

305
00:17:07,180 --> 00:17:09,160
- I don't want to fight a shark.

306
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:10,080
- Yeah, I'm inside.

307
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:11,660
- I think I'd like to hide in his huge body.

308
00:17:11,660 --> 00:17:12,920
- I'm gonna have you guys roll initiative

309
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:14,560
just 'cause you're around.

310
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:16,500
- Okay, we can man the controls inside.

311
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:18,980
- The dot on the bottom is a nine, right?

312
00:17:18,980 --> 00:17:19,820
- What?

313
00:17:19,820 --> 00:17:20,640
- Dot on the bottom is a nine.

314
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:21,780
- Yeah. - Okay, so I got a 10.

315
00:17:21,780 --> 00:17:24,540
- Well, it's on the bottom of whatever the number is.

316
00:17:24,540 --> 00:17:25,380
- Okay.

317
00:17:25,380 --> 00:17:27,340
- So if the dot is on the bottom of a six, it's a six.

318
00:17:27,340 --> 00:17:28,620
- I got a six.

319
00:17:29,620 --> 00:17:32,940

340
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:09,740
more still a little bit

341
00:19:09,740 --> 00:19:13,060
so you also is right now we're in this form you can't

342
00:19:13,060 --> 00:19:14,660
do combat

343
00:19:14,660 --> 00:19:18,040
but i'm gonna have to have to throw everyone up

344
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:20,040
you can follow up stated here

345
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:21,640
of clinton's room at all

346
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:25,440
also more and clean it's like high school all over again what happened

347
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:29,200
poltergeist will have to figure out what happened figure out how i got first i

348
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:32,720

349
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:36,560
him so here is your now we've been i'm not i'm not a very serious i want to

350
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:39,880
actively not fight this show yet now that i've heard what he's doing on my

351
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:43,960
turn i got first i'm gonna clue myself to the floor i'm not interested in him

352
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:46,960
surviving i probably have something

353
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:50,040
i can't talk at time myself to him or something

354
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:53,680
since i saw myself to i don't know his you feel a little weiner are you type

355
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:54,960
something like usual

356
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:57,160
weiner inside

357
00:19:57,160 --> 00:20:01,200
tires of the middle of the fun my role of my inventory i guess i'm not going to

358
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:04,800
because i'm going to be a time like cosmos and i literally really really

359
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:08,880
tired you have wrote that it will have a weight on it and that you feel a if i

360
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:12,720
move around you do have a real good now how to tie yourself not a fucking

361
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:15,440
scientist okay i'd be making my head

362
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:17,440
you can tie yourself to

363
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:18,440
my like a control

364
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:19,440
definitely don't tie yourself to my uvula

365
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:21,440
i'm tying myself where

366
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:22,440
anywhere that's sticking out

367
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:23,440
ok

368
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:24,440
that is tieable

369
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:25,440
do you have a handle in your body?

370
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:26,440
i don't care about which

371
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:28,440
i do have a handle but it's an eject handle

372
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:30,440
and it ejects every person inside of me

373
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:32,440
it doesn't, i'm gonna be tying myself to it

374
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:33,440
i won't be ejected, that's the whole thing

375
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:35,440
patches, i'm just gonna simplify this for you

376
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:37,440
i'm just gonna dig my fingernails

377
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:38,440
into his body

378
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:39,440
not your turn

379
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:40,440
not your turn

380
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:41,440
and i'm just gonna hold on for dear life

381
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:44,440
and just so you know, that's gonna be my turn

382
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:46,440
Okay, then I tie myself to the steering wheel.

383
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:49,440
Okay, so you can do that as your first action, technically.

384
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:51,440
And now it's the shark's turn.

385
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:54,440
The shark is just gonna keep trying to eat Squanza.

386
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:57,440
Hey, great D&D fantasy character patches. A shark.

387
00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:58,440
Nice creature.

388
00:20:58,440 --> 00:21:02,440
The point is he was trying to summon a Kraken, and he fucked up and just got a shark.

389
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:03,440
What's up?

390
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:05,440
We can bolt if it's going after Squanza.

391
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:06,440
We should shoot a bolt at him.

392
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:09,440
That's a very fine idea, so miss.

393
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:10,440
Do I have a cannon on me?

394
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:11,440
No.

395
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:17,840
And yeah, the shark tries to chomp at Squanza, and Squanza's able to sort of like, get out

396
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:18,840
of the way.

397
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:19,840
"Ahh!

398
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:20,840
Ahh!"

399
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:21,840
You know, the Squidward yells.

400
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:22,840
He's like, "I'm gonna leave."

401
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:23,840
He does like that.

402
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:24,840
Okay.

403
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:25,840
Your turn, Chuggy.

404
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:26,840
I'm going straight up.

405
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:29,840
I'm gonna do a free-willy jump.

406
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:30,840
Okay.

407
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:32,360
Over what?

408
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:33,360
Just out of the way.

409
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:36,360
I'm gonna look, there's an island close by, right?

410
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:37,360
Yeah.

411
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:38,360
So you can beat yourself on that.

412
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:39,480
There isn't necessarily, I mean, you can just go.

413
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:41,840
You can just use your turn to just...

414
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:45,680
I just wanna do like a giant jump and I wanna beach myself on shore.

415
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:48,520
Can you save the free willy stuff for when there's somebody.

416
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:49,520
Alright fine, I'm just gonna go to shore.

417
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:50,520
Can't the fucking jump over?

418
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:54,400
Yeah, I mean if you just, just, you know, swim away you can just get away from this.

419
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:55,400
Okay, I'm gonna do that.

420
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:56,400
I'm just gonna swim away.

421
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:57,400
Yeah, you just go, you just hear.

422
00:21:57,400 --> 00:21:58,400
Do I roll?

423
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:00,320
No, you don't have to roll, it's just movement.

424
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:02,640
I'm gonna just see if Squanzo lives.

425
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:07,480
Squanzo's gonna do one of his spell attacks.

426
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:10,480
Why do we care if Squanzo, he's out of sight out of mind.

469
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:44,360

474
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:15,440
I'm assuming G'day, Kuntal is a scaredy cat race just because that is the accent of the

475
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:16,440
scaredy cats.

476
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:18,440
And I have a crocodile codpiece.

477
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:21,880
It's a codpiece.

478
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:22,880
That's a penis holder.

479
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:23,880
So you're 5'2"?

480
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:24,880
5'2".

481
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:27,880
So you're like an elf I guess?

482
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:31,880
Yeah, it's a guy I saw one time.

483
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:36,080
And you're not sure what race he is?

484
00:25:36,080 --> 00:26:05,080
I

485
00:26:05,080 --> 00:26:12,080
you

486
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:17,960
I mean with the 15, I'll say like, at least from what Chuggy is able to suss out, I mean

487
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:22,360
this is just a island, like one of those, just one of those islands.

488
00:26:22,360 --> 00:26:26,560
Well just like a random landmass that kind of like billowed up and doesn't really have

489
00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:27,560
anything going on.

490
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:31,200
But we're not gonna get, as far as we know, we're not gonna get like coconut crabified

491
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:32,920
or like head shrunken or something.

492
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:37,560
But is there any kind of tropical wildlife, like maybe like a, like a, like a, like a

493
00:26:37,560 --> 00:26:38,560
star fruit?

494
00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:40,400
Or is there like a starburst tree?

495
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:42,400
Oh my god, we almost said the same thing.

496
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:42,900
Yeah.

497
00:26:42,900 --> 00:26:44,240
We almost had a jinx.

498
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:45,120
What were you gonna say?

499
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:46,120
Starfruit.

500
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:47,240
I said a starburst tree.

501
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:48,720
There are-- there is fruit in here.

502
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:50,720
I asked about coconuts basically the second we--

503
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:51,220
Sorry.

504
00:26:51,220 --> 00:26:53,600
Yes, there are-- there are coconuts.

505
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:55,000
Are you rubbing my leg right now?

506
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:55,500
I'm sorry.

507
00:26:55,500 --> 00:26:56,200
I'm just-- sorry.

508
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:57,600
Why are you being so weird today?

509
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:59,400
Why are you guys making me weird?

510
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:00,800
Gently rubbing my back.

511
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:04,720

A blind bozma

557
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:52,520

558
00:28:52,520 --> 00:28:54,520

00:28:56,520 --> 00:28:58,520
"Good morning."

561
00:28:58,520 --> 00:29:00,520
Because he's like, he thinks fish are women.

562
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:02,920
He thinks it's their vaginas.

563
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:06,040
He thinks the scent, the smell, the look, the way it looks.

564
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:10,120
Is G'day Contal like the kind of bard, is he like a comedian bard?

565
00:29:10,120 --> 00:29:11,120
Is he like a Ricky DeVito?

566
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:12,120
He's uh, a drunk.

567
00:29:12,120 --> 00:29:14,920
He's just a drunk guy.

568
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:15,920
He's addicted to Fosters.

569
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:16,920
Fosters are cool.

570
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:17,920
Fosters are home for imaginary friends.

571
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:18,920
He loves that show.

572
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:19,920
He's patched like a kangaroo.

573
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:20,920

574
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:21,920

He's a kangaroo guy.

577
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:24,920
He's a kangaroo guy.

578
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:25,920
He's a kangaroo guy.

579
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:26,920
He's a kangaroo guy.

580
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:27,920
He's a kangaroo guy.

581
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:28,920
He's a kangaroo guy.

582
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:29,920
He's a kangaroo guy.

583
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:34,120
I guess I saw a kangaroo.

584
00:29:34,120 --> 00:29:35,120
In gun city?

585
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:36,120
Or in gun, in tributary village?

586
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:38,120
He made a fucking shark earlier.

587
00:29:38,120 --> 00:29:39,120
Yeah, you're right.

588
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:40,120
You can get a kangaroo.

589
00:29:40,120 --> 00:29:41,120
That's true.

590
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:42,120
It's actually, it's a dangeroo.

591
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:43,120
There's no way there could be a kangaroo.

592
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:44,120
Okay, it's a dangeroo.

593
00:29:44,120 --> 00:29:47,920
It's a dangeroo and its feet have Nike shocks on them.

594
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:49,600
That's what makes them dangerous?

595
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:50,600
That's sick.

596
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:53,200
That's actually really cool.

597
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:55,760
I want somebody, I want to see a picture of one of these.

598
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:57,800

678
00:33:19,740 --> 00:33:21,660
creating bones

679
00:33:21,660 --> 00:33:22,820
blood and stuff

680
00:33:22,820 --> 00:33:27,340

681
00:33:27,340 --> 00:33:29,740
like it's the memory of the memory of it

682
00:33:29,740 --> 00:33:34,300

00:33:53,900 --> 00:33:56,300
you can chill here or you can keep going

691
00:33:56,300 --> 00:33:59,580
do you have a changeling that might be some kind of

692
00:33:59,580 --> 00:34:06,580
like beach chair or a floaty

693
00:34:06,580 --> 00:34:10,380
and drink my coconut

694
00:34:10,380 --> 00:34:11,260
uh...

695
00:34:11,260 --> 00:34:12,020
what

696
00:34:12,020 --> 00:34:13,340
i mean

697
00:34:13,340 --> 00:34:15,180
alright check this out

698
00:34:15,180 --> 00:34:17,660
and i pull off my leg and turn it into a floating chair

699
00:34:17,660 --> 00:34:21,140
oh my fucking god your inspector gadget

700
00:34:21,140 --> 00:34:23,060
holy shit

701
00:34:23,060 --> 00:34:24,380
he's allowing it

702
00:34:24,380 --> 00:34:28,260
i'm already sitting in it so there's no way we can go back or else

703
00:34:28,260 --> 00:34:32,260
I take my other one off and I turn it into that big Margaritaville chair.

704
00:34:32,260 --> 00:34:36,760
You can only turn your limbs into Margaritaville shit.

705
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:37,260
Okay.

706
00:34:37,260 --> 00:34:39,260
That is- I'm sitting on the other leg.

707
00:34:39,260 --> 00:34:42,260
And I turn my arm into a Margaritamaker.

708
00:34:42,260 --> 00:34:47,260
See, you gave him the leeway by saying your limbs. He was only at the legs.

709
00:34:47,260 --> 00:34:47,760
No, it's fine.

710
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:49,260
And then you were like, "No, go wild on the arms."

711
00:34:49,260 --> 00:34:53,260
Because we were talking about a Jimmy Buffet character, so like, we found a way to like, still have that.

712
00:34:53,260 --> 00:34:57,760
Is this Margaritamaker, is this thing endless? And also, be real with me, is that your blood I'm drinking?

713
00:34:57,760 --> 00:34:58,260
Yes.

714
00:34:58,260 --> 00:34:58,760
Fuck.

715
00:34:58,760 --> 00:35:00,760
I'll have ten of those.

716
00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:02,760
Alright!

717
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:04,760
I'm drinking a bunch of them too.

718
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:06,760
We're drinking all of his blood.

719
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:08,760
It's becoming very sickly.

720
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:10,760
I'm eating coconuts to try and keep up.

721
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:12,760
I'm just like...

722
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:14,760
I'm having a great time, guys!

723
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:17,760
I'm having one of the best times in my life!

724
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:22,760
No blood in your body, no limbs either.

725
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:32,760
in

726
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:34,760
I mean, I look like Kirby, so I'm not.

727
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:36,760
Do you have any, like, shrimp?

728
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:40,760
Oh, what would really hit the spot right now is some coconut shrimp.

729
00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:43,760
I turn my penis into a net.

730
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:45,760
I put all my body parts...

731
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:49,760
I put all my body parts back on.

732
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:51,760
That is your final limb you could use.

733
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:53,760
Okay. Well, no, I'm putting all the limbs back on.

734
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:55,760
What about your toes? I feel like those would be good.

735
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:57,760
So they're already stuffed full of margaritas right now.

736
00:35:57,760 --> 00:35:59,760
But I really want shrimp.

737
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:03,200
I'm turning my penis into a big net and I'm trying to just catch

738
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:09,520
Oh, okay, I was gonna eat his fuck out of your penis. Yeah, same

739
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:18,200
Yeah roll survival oh my god, I finally get to roll survival

740
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:21,740

Oh my god.

744
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:36,400
Are they at least already popcorned?

745
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:37,400
Are they pre-popcorned?

746
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:38,400
No.

747
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:39,800
I pull up a fucking...

748
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:40,800
They are de-veined though.

749
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:41,800
It's a cardboard box.

750
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:42,800
A freezer drink.

751
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:43,800
Half of it's gone.

752
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:44,800
Half of it's gone and they're so wet.

753
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:45,800
There's a note on it that's wet that says "sorry."

754
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:46,800
Yeah.

755
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:47,800
They're expired and...

756
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:48,800
Alright, I'll eat them anyway.

757
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:49,800
I'm chowing down.

758
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:50,800
Yeah, that's great.

759
00:36:50,800 --> 00:37:03,800
I mean, I would say you should save them because they can restore hit points.

760
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:07,920

769
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:47,640

00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:57,140
of out of game time twenty four hours and

772
00:37:57,140 --> 00:38:00,380
all right you think of it what do you think i'd turn it into a grill

773
00:38:00,380 --> 00:38:01,400
to grill

774
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:02,520
the barbie

775
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:06,160
and i started a shit all on the grill and cooking the shit all

776
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:11,820
always on that i'm i'm running as fast as i can't running almost two miles per

777
00:38:11,820 --> 00:38:14,160
hour i think i'll just fly around as well

778
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:20,160
I start flying, I fly through the sky and I start erecting giant, it's like a lucid dream,

779
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:22,160
I start bringing up giant skyscrapers.

780
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:24,160
Maybe that's how we justify this.

781
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:28,160
But then we create this, I see, I, I, you create skyscrapers and I'm on the ground and I'm

782
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:32,160
molding sand into little people and I'm creating a civilization that lives in the city.

783
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:34,160
We have a civilization that's going, "Hi, we love you!"

784
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:37,160
And they're developing technology but then the technology becomes too strong and it starts

785
00:38:37,160 --> 00:38:39,160
destroying them, pulling them apart, right?

786
00:38:39,160 --> 00:38:43,160
Climate change comes, a giant wave wipes out the city.

787
00:38:43,160 --> 00:38:44,160
Oh my god.

788
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:47,160
Right, and from the ashes, one worm.

789
00:38:47,160 --> 00:38:51,760
The worm builds a spaceship and he escapes the climate change island.

790
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:52,760
And he goes all the way out.

791
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:54,760
And he builds a space station up in the air.

792
00:38:54,760 --> 00:38:56,360
With a hundred other worms up there.

793
00:38:56,360 --> 00:39:00,480
Yeah, he reproduces with them and they create beautiful - and then the worms, they look

794
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:03,960
down and they see the ruins of this civilization and they want to explore it.

795
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:07,800
But they're a warlike people and they are very aggressive.

796
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:11,240
So they're coming down in these jet fighters and they're just making sure there's nobody

797
00:39:11,240 --> 00:39:14,820
alive left in the civilization. They're going "Mreeeow" and they're dropping bombs.

798
00:39:14,820 --> 00:39:15,820
Atom bombs.

799
00:39:15,820 --> 00:39:16,820
Atom bombs.

800
00:39:16,820 --> 00:39:17,820
They're pretty rad.

801
00:39:17,820 --> 00:39:18,820
Atom bombs.

802
00:39:18,820 --> 00:39:19,820
Mushroom clouds.

803
00:39:19,820 --> 00:39:20,820
Where's your grill?

804
00:39:20,820 --> 00:39:24,460
Oh, I turned back into myself and I turned my finger into a bottle of soda.

805
00:39:24,460 --> 00:39:26,780
Sorry, keep going.

806
00:39:26,780 --> 00:39:28,180
And then the mushroom clouds and then...

807
00:39:28,180 --> 00:39:30,220
I'm just standing and watching all this drinking a soda.

808
00:39:30,220 --> 00:39:33,500
What kind of animal eats mushrooms?

809
00:39:33,500 --> 00:39:34,500
Snail.

810
00:39:34,500 --> 00:39:35,500
A pig.

811
00:39:35,500 --> 00:39:36,500
A snail.

812
00:39:36,500 --> 00:39:37,500
A snail.

813
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:38,500
A snail.

814
00:39:38,500 --> 00:39:39,500
A snail.

815
00:39:39,500 --> 00:39:40,500
A snail.

816
00:39:40,500 --> 00:39:44,380
of a planet. It sees the mushroom cloud and thinks it's a mushroom and comes over and

817
00:39:44,380 --> 00:39:49,200
tries to eat it. And then it becomes irradiated. And then it starts to attack the earth that

818
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:55,380
we us four actually in real life live on. And it starts to destroy us. And it kills

819
00:39:55,380 --> 00:40:01,100
Patches, his entire family, his mom, his dad, his brothers, his sisters, every single person

820
00:40:01,100 --> 00:40:06,700
in your family is completely wiped out. And it kills a lot of people all over the world.

821
00:40:06,700 --> 00:40:19,700
but

822
00:40:19,700 --> 00:40:24,420
and it's called it's called um... the life of uh...

823
00:40:24,420 --> 00:40:28,500
the life of a penguin and he plays a penguin sergeant

824
00:40:28,500 --> 00:40:33,060
he plays a sergeant in the penguin army

825
00:40:33,060 --> 00:40:34,920
wait one more thing

826
00:40:34,920 --> 00:40:39,540

827
00:40:39,540 --> 00:40:43,660

828
00:40:43,660 --> 00:40:44,540

00:40:44,540 --> 00:40:47,660
Alright, I'm gonna turn back into the big blue bitch

Oxygen

00:40:57,540 --> 00:40:59,540
All right turn back to Chuggie

833
00:40:59,540 --> 00:41:06,060
Some sort of lucid dream happens that I guess tells you tells me how you guys really feel about me

00:41:06,060 --> 00:41:12,580
And you know you know your whole family and how we feel about Ukraine. Yeah, that's true, which is we don't play

Slava my slat in the Ukraine my slimes over and we don't fucking play when it comes to Ukraine. No, let that be known

838

And what it's doing is it's taking-

844
00:41:50,580 --> 00:41:52,780
Yeah, yeah.

00:41:52,780 --> 00:41:58,340
Or what about like a croctopig and it's part crocodile and part pig and octopus?

846
00:41:58,340 --> 00:41:59,740
No, I think just a croctopus.

Alright, well it's two out of three ain't bad.

Okay, what about-

I don't like to take this, we're not on the island.

850
00:42:04,700 --> 00:42:06,380
No, I think the croctopus is fun.

851
00:42:06,380 --> 00:42:07,380
The croctopus-

00:43:35,620 --> 00:43:49,620
I'm

864
00:43:49,620 --> 00:44:09,620
all

865
00:44:09,620 --> 00:44:12,620
Wait, wait, wait, I use challenging instincts.

866
00:44:12,620 --> 00:44:14,120
Oh, what does that do?

867
00:44:14,120 --> 00:44:17,820
You gain proficiency with the two of the following skills of your choice, deception, insight,

868
00:44:17,820 --> 00:44:19,340
intimidation, and persuasion.

869
00:44:19,340 --> 00:44:23,380
So I'm going to use that on both insight and intimidation.

870
00:44:23,380 --> 00:44:25,740
Or persuasion?

871
00:44:25,740 --> 00:44:27,340
I have a question too.

872
00:44:27,340 --> 00:44:29,020
Yeah, you might want to do persuasion.

873
00:44:29,020 --> 00:44:30,500
Okay, I'll do persuasion and insight.

874
00:44:30,500 --> 00:44:32,860
You get one on all of them, by the way?

875
00:44:32,860 --> 00:44:34,900
You gain proficiency with two of the following skills.

876
00:44:34,900 --> 00:44:35,900
Okay, cool.

877
00:44:35,900 --> 00:44:36,900
So we'll add...

878
00:44:36,900 --> 00:44:37,900
Yeah, because you don't have proficiency.

879
00:44:37,900 --> 00:44:41,420
You already have proficiency on insight is the only thing.

880
00:44:41,420 --> 00:44:42,420
Does it add...

881
00:44:42,420 --> 00:44:44,380
Deception and persuasion.

882
00:44:44,380 --> 00:44:45,620
You have expertise on those.

883
00:44:45,620 --> 00:44:47,340
No, you already have...

884
00:44:47,340 --> 00:44:48,340
That's just like a boost.

885
00:44:48,340 --> 00:44:49,340
Oh, is that a...

886
00:44:49,340 --> 00:44:50,340
Okay.

887
00:44:50,340 --> 00:44:51,340
Oh, so I already...

888
00:44:51,340 --> 00:44:52,340
I can't...

889
00:44:52,340 --> 00:44:53,340
No, yeah, yeah, yeah, no.

890
00:44:53,340 --> 00:44:54,340
I can't activate it.

891
00:44:54,340 --> 00:44:55,340
Got it.

892
00:44:55,340 --> 00:44:56,340
What you can do...

893
00:44:56,340 --> 00:44:57,340
I mean, you have...

894
00:44:57,340 --> 00:44:59,340
What you do have, you have the ability fast friends.

895
00:44:59,340 --> 00:45:02,620
So when you need to make sure something gets done, you can't rely on vague promises, sworn

896
00:45:02,620 --> 00:45:04,300
oaths, or binding contracts of employment.

897
00:45:04,300 --> 00:45:07,020
You cast a spell, choose one humanoid...

898
00:45:07,020 --> 00:45:08,020
We're gonna ignore that.

899
00:45:08,020 --> 00:45:10,540
Within range that you can see and hear you, and that can understand you, the creature

900
00:45:10,540 --> 00:45:12,940
must succeed in a wisdom saving throw or become charmed by you for the duration.

901
00:45:12,940 --> 00:45:13,940
I'm gonna use that.

902
00:45:13,940 --> 00:45:17,500
While the creature is charming this way, it undertakes to perform any services or activities

903
00:45:17,500 --> 00:45:20,260
you ask of it in a friendly manner to the best of its ability.

904
00:45:20,260 --> 00:45:21,260
I will do that.

905
00:45:21,260 --> 00:45:22,260
So what are you gonna ask of it though?

906
00:45:22,260 --> 00:45:23,260
I'll think about it.

907
00:45:23,260 --> 00:45:27,020
Can I ask a question about the mechanics of the game?

908
00:45:27,020 --> 00:45:29,420
Can I ask a question about the mechanics of what this...

909
00:45:29,420 --> 00:45:33,180
So is it, there are shells that are getting shuffled up and we're trying to point to which

910
00:45:33,180 --> 00:45:34,180
thing is...

911
00:45:34,180 --> 00:45:35,180
Yes.

912
00:45:35,180 --> 00:45:42,180
is

913
00:45:42,180 --> 00:46:11,140
so

914
00:46:11,140 --> 00:46:18,140
the

915
00:46:18,140 --> 00:46:20,140
doesn't work then this is our backup.

916
00:46:20,140 --> 00:46:21,140
Ok.

917
00:46:21,140 --> 00:46:27,860
So in this case, this is instantaneous and it is standard action, no it's one casting

918
00:46:27,860 --> 00:46:29,300
time so in what level is it?

919
00:46:29,300 --> 00:46:30,540
It's level one spell right?

920
00:46:30,540 --> 00:46:32,660
How many spell slots do you have?

921
00:46:32,660 --> 00:46:34,820
I have four I think.

922
00:46:34,820 --> 00:46:35,820
I think you do too.

923
00:46:35,820 --> 00:46:38,220
So I think you can probably cast.

924
00:46:38,220 --> 00:46:43,140
I mean I also don't have to use it until we don't, until we get a bad insight roll.

925
00:46:43,140 --> 00:46:44,140
Ok cool.

926
00:46:44,140 --> 00:46:46,300
Let me see how many spells you have.

927
00:46:46,300 --> 00:46:47,700
It's just our bad, we have that in our back pocket.

928
00:46:47,700 --> 00:47:02,700
the

929
00:47:02,700 --> 00:47:05,700
You can also do blindness and deafness if you want to get into a fight.

930
00:47:05,700 --> 00:47:07,700
I'd do it on myself again.

931
00:47:07,700 --> 00:47:09,700
Okay, don't do that.

932
00:47:09,700 --> 00:47:10,700
Blind and deaf.

933
00:47:10,700 --> 00:47:11,700
You'll lose the spell slot.

934
00:47:11,700 --> 00:47:12,700
No, go ahead.

935
00:47:12,700 --> 00:47:15,700
Alright, so roll insight.

936
00:47:15,700 --> 00:47:19,700
I need a D8.

937
00:47:19,700 --> 00:47:20,700
Oh, I need a D8?

938
00:47:20,700 --> 00:47:21,700
No, I need a D8.

939
00:47:21,700 --> 00:47:24,700
You got a 9 and a 3, right?

940
00:47:24,700 --> 00:47:25,700
Yeah, 3.

941
00:47:25,700 --> 00:47:28,700
And then roll again because you get advantage because you guys are working together as friends.

942
00:47:28,700 --> 00:47:30,700
Oh, damn, that sucks.

943
00:47:30,700 --> 00:47:31,700
A 7.

944
00:47:31,700 --> 00:47:43,060
seven. Let me roll my d8. Here, I'll roll it for you. No, no, no, no, no. So you, you roll

945
00:47:43,060 --> 00:47:50,900
an eight instantly. All right, cool. And what'd you get a 12? Yeah. Okay. It is not, you know

946
00:47:50,900 --> 00:47:56,860
for sure it is not in tentacles. So there's one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight

947
00:47:56,860 --> 00:48:01,220
You know for sure it's not in tentacle.

948
00:48:01,220 --> 00:48:04,460
8, 7, 4, and 1.

949
00:48:04,460 --> 00:48:06,660
Do we want to cast my spell here?

950
00:48:06,660 --> 00:48:07,660
Yeah.

951
00:48:07,660 --> 00:48:10,460
Okay, I'm going to surreptitiously cast detect poison.

952
00:48:10,460 --> 00:48:11,460
Okay, cool.

953
00:48:11,460 --> 00:48:12,460
So roll...

954
00:48:12,460 --> 00:48:13,460
Why detect poison?

955
00:48:13,460 --> 00:48:17,060
Because we're trying to find a baby octopus which is poisonous.

956
00:48:17,060 --> 00:48:18,060
Which does have poison.

957
00:48:18,060 --> 00:48:19,060
Octopi.

958
00:48:19,060 --> 00:48:21,780
We had a whole discussion about it.

959
00:48:21,780 --> 00:48:22,780
It is a croc-topus.

960
00:48:22,780 --> 00:48:23,780
That's true.

961
00:48:23,780 --> 00:48:24,780
It is a croc-topus.

962
00:48:24,780 --> 00:48:25,780
Holy shit, man.

963
00:48:25,780 --> 00:48:29,780
So yeah, okay, you can detect it underneath three.

964
00:48:29,780 --> 00:48:30,780
Okay.

965
00:48:30,780 --> 00:48:34,780
I tapped three times on the inside of his body.

966
00:48:34,780 --> 00:48:35,780
Three!

967
00:48:35,780 --> 00:48:40,780
Okay, and the octopus lifts it up and like claps two of its tentacles for you and slide

968
00:48:40,780 --> 00:48:45,780
and reaches with one of its arms behind itself, the croctopus I should say, and slides out

969
00:48:45,780 --> 00:48:46,780
15 gold.

970
00:48:46,780 --> 00:48:48,780
Yo

971
00:48:48,780 --> 00:48:50,780
Add 15 gold to your inventory

972
00:48:50,780 --> 00:48:56,860
His inventory yeah, I'm the one who's the one who found the damn boy. He's giving it to him

973
00:48:56,860 --> 00:48:59,380
We're splitting it up after okay

974
00:48:59,380 --> 00:49:03,300
Okay, so now

975
00:49:03,300 --> 00:49:07,740
Wait did I use become fast friends? No you did not yeah, I'm gonna do that right now

976
00:49:07,740 --> 00:49:12,260
Well the only thing with that is listen buddy the only thing would become fast friends

977
00:49:12,260 --> 00:49:15,260
you should know is it's about asking it to perform a specific task and

978
00:49:16,540 --> 00:49:19,700
the task that performs if it's like so what if I just say like

979
00:49:19,700 --> 00:49:22,820
but get baller a normal and just give me all the good stuff

980
00:49:22,820 --> 00:49:26,460
well I do love that idea you saying that

981
00:49:26,460 --> 00:49:30,180
but I'm it's important to support the thing is that

982
00:49:30,180 --> 00:49:33,620
I'm the activity result is much more make sure to the country at the

983
00:49:33,620 --> 00:49:36,140
conflicts the creatures normal activities and desires a creature can

984
00:49:36,140 --> 00:49:38,340
make another wisdom saving their training in the effect

985
00:49:38,340 --> 00:49:42,340
said the only thing you'd be risking okay but if it just ends the effect

986
00:49:42,340 --> 00:49:45,820
it might be aware that that happened I'm

987
00:49:45,820 --> 00:49:48,060
I don't know, I actually don't know if it becomes a ware.

988
00:49:48,060 --> 00:49:49,060
Well he's a carny.

989
00:49:49,060 --> 00:49:51,500
Yeah, when the spell ends the creature knows it was...

990
00:49:51,500 --> 00:49:52,500
The creature will know it was a rare.

991
00:49:52,500 --> 00:49:56,300
You should save it until we don't have any more detect poison left and then try to use

992
00:49:56,300 --> 00:49:57,300
it on the last one.

993
00:49:57,300 --> 00:49:58,300
I would wait.

994
00:49:58,300 --> 00:50:00,700
Alright, so now roll another insight check as it whiffs everything around.

995
00:50:00,700 --> 00:50:02,820
We're gonna get all five of these fucking prizes.

996
00:50:02,820 --> 00:50:03,820
Let's go.

997
00:50:03,820 --> 00:50:05,820
Ooh, that is a 19.

998
00:50:05,820 --> 00:50:11,100
20, 21, 23, 24, 25.

999
00:50:11,100 --> 00:50:12,260
You know it's...

1000
00:50:12,260 --> 00:50:13,260
25.

1001
00:50:13,260 --> 00:50:15,780
Okay, you know it's in either 5 or 6.

1002
00:50:15,780 --> 00:50:18,500
Okay, now just do whichever is higher

1003
00:50:18,500 --> 00:50:23,660
Which is Patrick's I cast the spell or no

1004
00:50:23,660 --> 00:50:30,920
If we if we get this one wrong do we not get to keep going I think it's in five

1005
00:50:30,920 --> 00:50:36,620
We don't get to keep going if we get it wrong. Okay, then we just cast a spell every time so we can get at least

1006
00:50:36,620 --> 00:50:38,620
Yeah, yeah, all right

1007
00:50:38,620 --> 00:50:42,060
Cool, that's fine. I'll just sleep on him

1008
00:50:42,660 --> 00:50:47,420
Over the next day. Well, but it's already narrowed down to two. I feel like yeah, I mean, okay

1009
00:50:47,420 --> 00:50:52,900
Well, is it worth the risk live, but I know he's gonna change it. Okay. We'll say okay that I won't cast this spell

1010
00:50:52,900 --> 00:50:54,900
I mean, I'm funny as long as both slots. Sure

1011
00:50:54,900 --> 00:51:01,600
You know, so I'm getting talked out of it here. I do know what it is. But all right, you know, you got spell

1012
00:51:01,600 --> 00:51:03,600
Okay, it is six

1013
00:51:03,600 --> 00:51:05,340
Wow, I

1014
00:51:05,340 --> 00:51:09,940
Mean this would be the time to try to do one that's fast friends and see if you can get I just thought there's no way

1015
00:51:09,940 --> 00:51:12,420
Yeah, give you the prize instead and keep going

1016
00:51:12,420 --> 00:51:15,860
What do you mean give me the prize?

1017
00:51:15,860 --> 00:51:20,300
If you do fast friends you can ask him, "Well why don't you actually just give it to me?"

1018
00:51:20,300 --> 00:51:21,300
Did we not get it?

1019
00:51:21,300 --> 00:51:22,300
I thought he already got a prize.

1020
00:51:22,300 --> 00:51:23,300
I said it was six.

1021
00:51:23,300 --> 00:51:24,300
Oh, I thought he said five.

1022
00:51:24,300 --> 00:51:25,860
No, he changed his mind before you.

1023
00:51:25,860 --> 00:51:26,860
Oh he did?

1024
00:51:26,860 --> 00:51:28,460
He said five and six and five and six a bunch of different times.

1025
00:51:28,460 --> 00:51:29,460
Yeah, that's why I was confused.

1026
00:51:29,460 --> 00:51:30,460
He said six.

1027
00:51:30,460 --> 00:51:31,460
Because I said, "Because it's six."

1028
00:51:31,460 --> 00:51:32,460
No, I swear to God.

1029
00:51:32,460 --> 00:51:36,500
Okay, you listened to my advice of saying that it was the higher one.

1030
00:51:36,500 --> 00:51:37,500
Okay, good.

1031
00:51:37,500 --> 00:51:38,500
Alright, good.

1032
00:51:38,500 --> 00:51:41,780
In that case, then you get roll, one of you roll 2d4.

1033
00:51:41,780 --> 00:51:50,660

00:52:09,140 --> 00:52:11,500
Wasn't that kind of a good moment for the listener cast

1037
00:52:11,500 --> 00:52:14,380
Like that

1038
00:52:14,380 --> 00:52:17,260
So I have it I have in cities

1039
00:52:17,260 --> 00:52:20,180
Yeah, just go ahead and roll and if we don't know which one is for certain I'll cast it

1040
00:52:20,180 --> 00:52:23,340
Okay, I'll burn all my spell slots cuz I'll just take a long rest

1041
00:52:23,340 --> 00:52:27,540
15 okay

1042
00:52:27,540 --> 00:52:34,180
Sorry

1043
00:52:35,460 --> 00:52:43,040
No, you said 15. Yeah, okay, you know it's not in one two three four and five I cast it

1044
00:52:43,040 --> 00:52:45,980
Yeah, okay. I cast that I can't take that poison. I cast it

1045
00:52:45,980 --> 00:52:48,740
It is in seven. I

1046
00:52:48,740 --> 00:52:55,120
Did not realize I was not thinking that the octopus was we have poison. This is great that you guys gonna get a lot of cool

1047
00:52:55,120 --> 00:52:58,400
Shit. Yeah, he claps. He's like very impressed

1048
00:52:58,400 --> 00:53:01,220
He didn't clap the time that Caleb rolled

1049
00:53:03,740 --> 00:53:09,500
Can we can we get a clap for him? Maybe it's a little one. Thank you. We've got a little octopus clap

1050
00:53:09,500 --> 00:53:14,780
Boy you guys get amulet of the drunkard. Oh

1051
00:53:14,780 --> 00:53:20,020
Old ale stained wood. Oh my god while wearing it

1052
00:53:20,020 --> 00:53:25,000
You regain 44 plus 4 hit points when you drink a pint of beer ale mead or wine

1053
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:30,060
Doesn't make you act like lit once the amulet has restored hip. Don't use it when you get lit

1054
00:53:30,300 --> 00:53:33,920
Once the amulet has restored hit points it can do so again until the next dawn

1055
00:53:33,920 --> 00:53:39,580
I mean, this is basically health potions are really hard to come by if you're wearing this amulet you basically have like

1056
00:53:39,580 --> 00:53:46,160
One free very powerful health potion a day. That's sick if you for me that would be very affordable

1057
00:53:46,160 --> 00:53:51,140
We need to be writing this crap down. I have it written down and I will split it up at the end

1058
00:53:51,140 --> 00:53:54,820
Yeah, you split up at the end. Call the amulet of fucking being drunk if

1059
00:53:55,740 --> 00:53:57,740
Not cool, okay

1060
00:53:57,740 --> 00:54:04,500
Next roll you guys are gonna get everything that's right. That's right. Okay. There's only one item I mean on here I

1061
00:54:04,500 --> 00:54:12,500
Want every I want every good thing. That's right. Yeah everything you got we're cleaning out the kiss 11 today. That's not good

1062
00:54:12,500 --> 00:54:15,260
11 that's just like okay

1063
00:54:15,260 --> 00:54:20,860
I'm casting it don't even roll. You just can't this octopus is don't even roll. I'm casting it

1064
00:54:21,100 --> 00:54:25,800
Yes it all right, so you're down to I have one spot left. That's perfect

1065
00:54:25,800 --> 00:54:31,060
You know it's up, but we didn't use one for one of them. You know you know it's a little

1066
00:54:31,060 --> 00:54:34,720
You know it's in one. Yeah, so yeah, you get it

1067
00:54:34,720 --> 00:54:40,960
I tap once one and what you get the octopus octopus you can see he's fond of this item

1068
00:54:40,960 --> 00:54:43,580
It's a deck of illusions

1069
00:54:43,580 --> 00:54:46,020
Fuck dude. This is gonna make everything

1070
00:54:46,020 --> 00:54:51,220
I always wanted this this box contains a set of parchment cards a full deck has 34 cards

1071
00:54:51,220 --> 00:54:55,900
The deck found as treasures usually missing 1d 20 minus 1 cards, which I'll have to do that for next time

1072
00:54:55,900 --> 00:54:59,260
But the magic of the deck functions only if cards are drawn at random

1073
00:54:59,260 --> 00:55:04,100
So the one he made this magic. No. No, I didn't make this one. I don't make this wish I did

1074
00:55:04,100 --> 00:55:07,420
This is from D&D from the Wizards of the Coast

1075
00:55:07,420 --> 00:55:11,900
But what it does is essentially is it's like a bunch of cards and when you draw a card out

1076
00:55:11,900 --> 00:55:16,780
It'll just make an illusion of a creature and so then oh, so it's like you yeah

1077
00:55:16,780 --> 00:55:21,260
Yeah, basically and then like a mirror so it could be a massive beast

1078
00:55:21,260 --> 00:55:25,540
and then we'll scare the shit out of everybody or can distract people and

1079
00:55:25,540 --> 00:55:32,240
Once you use it, it's it's the card is gone. Okay, you basically have this deck of like you can have like 52

1080
00:55:32,240 --> 00:55:36,060
34 but it's a lot of different creatures basically your well

1081
00:55:36,860 --> 00:55:42,620
Sounds cool. It's not as cool as the fucking amulet. It gets you fucking slizzard doesn't get you slizzard. It's not but hey

1082
00:55:42,620 --> 00:55:47,080
That's one. Oh wait. Let's see what the next one is. Let's see what the final one is

1083
00:55:47,080 --> 00:55:52,340
Let's see what this final one is and listen. You still have the tech poison. I still have one left a chiller

1084
00:55:52,340 --> 00:55:55,100
Nice chiller episode folks

1085
00:55:55,100 --> 00:55:58,660
It's 11 again

1086
00:55:58,660 --> 00:56:01,300
Yeah, I cast the right poison spell slots

1087
00:56:01,300 --> 00:56:04,340
Okay, so this one's the one I made

1088
00:56:05,020 --> 00:56:09,080
Okay, it's cold and the octopus probably like a shoe or

1089
00:56:09,080 --> 00:56:18,180
Tentacle is trembling. Is this a shark? This is a computer. Yeah

1090
00:56:18,180 --> 00:56:21,500
and he takes out what looks like a

1091
00:56:21,500 --> 00:56:25,860
If like the octopus is like kind of scared of this item

1092
00:56:25,860 --> 00:56:29,060
It's called the blutter the what?

1093
00:56:29,060 --> 00:56:31,540
the blutter

1094
00:56:31,540 --> 00:56:34,280
No, it's an ancient terrible gun

1095
00:56:34,280 --> 00:56:38,280
After an attack connects, a player can declare that they're using a blood bullet.

1096
00:56:38,280 --> 00:56:45,280
Rather than dealing damage immediately, a blood bullet lodges into a living target and begins to deal the damage as necrotic damage over time.

1097
00:56:45,280 --> 00:56:50,280
The player rolls 68 and then divides the amount taken each round and round it up.

1098
00:56:50,280 --> 00:56:56,280
That amount is then granted as temporary hit points to whoever shot the weapon for a max of one half the user's total damage.

1099
00:56:56,280 --> 00:57:02,900
Holy crap, we have like a communal chest you can have a max of three blood bullets can be deployed at one time

1100
00:57:02,900 --> 00:57:06,780
And only one blood bullet can be lodged in one target until all the damage is done

1101
00:57:06,780 --> 00:57:11,360
So it's like you can't like stack mm-hmm, but you can like have it on three different people

1102
00:57:11,360 --> 00:57:15,120
Yeah, drain their HP each turn and add it to your own temporary

1103
00:57:15,120 --> 00:57:22,540
Letter it's called the blutter. Okay, who has the most HP? I think I have 28. I have 39 -

1104
00:57:23,040 --> 00:57:29,160
-43 okay, I feel like whoever has the highest HP should whoever is the lowest HP should get either the blood bullet or the drunk

1105
00:57:29,160 --> 00:57:30,840
Amulet right

1106
00:57:30,840 --> 00:57:37,280
Over the three things we got we got the drunk amulet the blood bullets and then water deck of deck of illusions

1107
00:57:37,280 --> 00:57:39,840
so

1108
00:57:39,840 --> 00:57:43,960
Who I mean also who wants what I guess I want this lizard amulet

1109
00:57:43,960 --> 00:57:47,320
Because I like getting fucked up. Okay. Yes, sir

1110
00:57:47,320 --> 00:57:52,640
Okay, and the bladder and a big cannon on me and amulet of the drunkard

1111
00:57:52,640 --> 00:57:58,720
I have a coconut smiley face. I have an amulet of the drunkard smiley face. Mm-hmm

1112
00:57:58,720 --> 00:58:03,860
You can turn the blutter into a okay, I guess I just haven't held potions

1113
00:58:03,860 --> 00:58:09,260
I guess I just get the deck of illusions and everyone else gets what they want. That's fine. Actually, I want to say any illusions

1114
00:58:09,260 --> 00:58:10,840
That's fine. Wait, I was yeah

1115
00:58:10,840 --> 00:58:15,520
I was being that with that one friend who like tries to make their home get the first and then you and then you

1116
00:58:15,520 --> 00:58:20,160
Start you then you try to cash it in immediately. I want to do I want to take illusions

1117
00:58:20,460 --> 00:58:22,460
No too late, it's too late

1118
00:58:22,460 --> 00:58:29,340
With my creative mind in that deck of illusions I would make some of the greatest beasts

1119
00:58:29,340 --> 00:58:32,780
No, it's not it's just a set. It's random, bro

1120
00:58:32,780 --> 00:58:38,940
It's random. I don't make up the beasts as I go. Oh, but no you think he'd give you that type of power and shit

1121
00:58:38,940 --> 00:58:41,060
that's true about a

1122
00:58:41,060 --> 00:58:46,500
Luggage named Oh lug. No, I had a slap the shit out of you for saying that Oh lug. No

1123
00:58:46,500 --> 00:58:53,500
know

1124
00:58:53,500 --> 00:58:54,500
Alright.

1125
00:58:54,500 --> 00:58:55,740
Wait, who got what?

1126
00:58:55,740 --> 00:58:59,380
Pat, did you take the deck of illusions?

1127
00:58:59,380 --> 00:59:02,500
I don't care either way.

1128
00:59:02,500 --> 00:59:05,520
You were telling me that I should take the blutter because my health points are low.

1129
00:59:05,520 --> 00:59:06,820
I mean that makes sense to me.

1130
00:59:06,820 --> 00:59:08,740
Yeah, I guess I'll do that then.

1131
00:59:08,740 --> 00:59:11,820
Because you get temporary HP.

1132
00:59:11,820 --> 00:59:12,820
Like a blizzard.

1133
00:59:12,820 --> 00:59:18,540
I also will say your dex is a more important stat for you and the blutter is going to deal

1134
00:59:18,540 --> 00:59:19,540
damage based on dexterity.

1135
00:59:19,540 --> 00:59:20,540
Turn it down for what?

1136
00:59:21,540 --> 00:59:27,260
I'll take the deck of illusions. I'm enjoying my amulet. Alright, cool. I'll give you the

1137
00:59:27,260 --> 00:59:33,580
chart for that next time we play. And if you're going to use it, I mean, now, let me know.

1138
00:59:33,580 --> 00:59:39,060
Okay, I'll use it right now. Alright, so, um. I'm just joking, dude. Use it to make

1139
00:59:39,060 --> 00:59:43,940
another octopus. I'm just playing. No, I'm playing. We could watch them mate. We could

1140
00:59:43,940 --> 00:59:49,860
watch them mate or we get the octopus to do this game to the octopus. It's literally an

1141
00:59:49,860 --> 00:59:52,900
Why does he have a baby octopus? Is that his son?

1142
00:59:52,900 --> 00:59:55,620
And why is he using his son?

1143
00:59:55,620 --> 00:59:57,620
His only begotten son?

1144
00:59:57,620 --> 00:59:58,780
Do you want to ask him?

1145
00:59:58,780 --> 01:00:01,140
Yeah, that's fucking irresponsible as shit.

1146
01:00:01,140 --> 01:00:05,860
What if I used a blaster on the fucking... where the shell where his son is?

1147
01:00:05,860 --> 01:00:07,860
An octopus just sort of shrugs.

1148
01:00:07,860 --> 01:00:12,740
And what if I got so angry at you that I decided to smash the shells?

1149
01:00:12,740 --> 01:00:15,300
And destroy your only begotten son?

1150
01:00:15,300 --> 01:00:18,660
An octopus freaks out about you destroying the shells and like sort of like...

1151
01:00:18,660 --> 01:00:23,300
You are just, I don't want, I'm glad that we lied and stole all your stuff.

1152
01:00:23,300 --> 01:00:25,380
And used secret magic that we didn't tell you.

1153
01:00:25,380 --> 01:00:29,380
Because my eyes widen.

1154
01:00:29,380 --> 01:00:31,380
Or at least I wish that we had done that.

1155
01:00:31,380 --> 01:00:33,660
We didn't do that. We played a normal affair.

1156
01:00:33,660 --> 01:00:35,660
But I wish that we had just rocked you.

1157
01:00:35,660 --> 01:00:36,660
Look at this, his eyes narrow.

1158
01:00:36,660 --> 01:00:38,660
There we go. Get those eyes back down.

1159
01:00:38,660 --> 01:00:39,660
[Laughter]

1160
01:00:39,660 --> 01:00:43,660
Because you are an irresponsible father and a bad human.

1161
01:00:43,660 --> 01:00:46,660
The octopus is sort of like, "And you smell fishy!"

1162
01:00:46,660 --> 01:00:50,600
Yep, and if I walked into a bar, he told me a joke earlier.

1163
01:00:50,600 --> 01:00:53,680
If I walked into a bar and you were there, I'd say there's women in this bar.

1164
01:00:53,680 --> 01:00:55,160
No, you screwed it up.

1165
01:00:55,160 --> 01:00:56,160
No, I think I didn't.

1166
01:00:56,160 --> 01:00:57,160
You screwed the joke up.

1167
01:00:57,160 --> 01:01:01,680
The octopus pulls out a joke almanac to try to recall what this could be.

1168
01:01:01,680 --> 01:01:03,320
It's all written in octopus.

1169
01:01:03,320 --> 01:01:04,320
I don't know how to read this.

1170
01:01:04,320 --> 01:01:08,400
It's all just black ink on the whole page.

1171
01:01:08,400 --> 01:01:09,400
I just see my mother.

1172
01:01:09,400 --> 01:01:10,400
You know what I mean?

1173
01:01:10,400 --> 01:01:11,400
Yeah, I got it.

1174
01:01:11,400 --> 01:01:12,400
Thanks.

1175
01:01:12,400 --> 01:01:13,400
Yeah, alright.

1176
01:01:13,400 --> 01:01:14,400
That's the octopus in there.

1177
01:01:14,400 --> 01:01:18,680
That's the octopus in there. The octopus sort of like swims away. You see him takes his son with him

1178
01:01:18,680 --> 01:01:23,240
The sun sort of waves that you guys. We should kill him and harvest him for his ink

1179
01:01:23,240 --> 01:01:29,000
We could sell it at a high price. Chuggie something is you have something wrong. I have a lot wrong

1180
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:39,120
What is wrong with you I just I just told him how to. I'm completely a criminal in other forms. Your name is evil Stevel

1181
01:01:39,120 --> 01:01:43,840
But I've become good-vil stuv-vil as of recently with my huge heart

1182
01:01:43,840 --> 01:01:50,740
And as I saw that son and it reminded me of my son that I've completely abandoned and forgot about until right now

1183
01:01:50,740 --> 01:01:54,860
Oh shit. You have a son. Yeah, and I'm what's your son's name name's fucking Doug

1184
01:01:54,860 --> 01:01:58,980
Fucking Doug Doug Stievel no

1185
01:01:58,980 --> 01:02:06,240
No, just Doug Doug and Doug fucking Doug. Yeah, and I Jenny was the light of my life

1186
01:02:06,240 --> 01:02:09,580
And I forgot about him until right now

1187
01:02:10,580 --> 01:02:13,620
Isn't that sad? What does his mommy look like?

1188
01:02:13,620 --> 01:02:17,820
He never knew his mommy

1189
01:02:17,820 --> 01:02:20,540
You

1190
01:02:20,540 --> 01:02:25,780
He never knew her at all. What about you? I don't he'd never even met her one time

1191
01:02:25,780 --> 01:02:30,060
What about you did you meet his mommy? I think I did a couple times

1192
01:02:30,060 --> 01:02:35,060
But I didn't remember her that well because she just wasn't that's kind of just not much to me

1193
01:02:35,060 --> 01:02:38,820
She didn't mean all that much. That was a different man. She didn't look like a whale

1194
01:02:38,820 --> 01:02:44,460
I was I used to wearing lipstick. I used to be a hoe in trebuchet village. I was a hoe

1195
01:02:44,460 --> 01:02:49,580
You're a hoe and I had a son and I forgot his name was Doug Doug

1196
01:02:49,580 --> 01:02:59,060
Son of Steve Doug son of Steve son of Steve. Oh, okay. I'm trying this down. Okay, that's a huge part of your character

1197
01:02:59,060 --> 01:03:01,060
Yeah, and I completely forgot that

1198
01:03:01,060 --> 01:03:04,240
And now I'm addicted to drinking

1199
01:03:04,900 --> 01:03:11,220
My drinking amulet and I'm gonna go back. I'm addicted to Percocet and he's got a pill problem

1200
01:03:11,220 --> 01:03:15,260
It's an herb and he I've seen him comes from the earth. We all have

1201
01:03:15,260 --> 01:03:18,580
Vices he put I seen him put floor in his mouth

1202
01:03:18,580 --> 01:03:25,700
On the floor I didn't do he put that in I kicks that I don't do that anymore

1203
01:03:25,700 --> 01:03:28,740
He did it at the bit. We got to that sand. It's different

1204
01:03:28,740 --> 01:03:34,320
But it directly when you found it's different than dirt you put your floor or the what I consider the floor

1205
01:03:34,320 --> 01:03:42,000
water in your mouth I've done that too water with my floor but now dirt is my

1206
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:50,480
floor I think this might be the most emotionally poignant moment that we've

1207
01:03:50,480 --> 01:03:59,200
ever had in the entire year. I'm about to dry. One of us died a day ago and this is more emotional than that.

1208
01:03:59,200 --> 01:04:01,200
Look at that. Look at the sky.

1209
01:04:01,200 --> 01:04:03,200
Yeah.

1210
01:04:03,200 --> 01:04:05,200
I'm drifting. I'm drifting away.

1211
01:04:05,200 --> 01:04:09,200
Congratulations.

1212
01:04:09,200 --> 01:04:11,200
Congratulations.

1213
01:04:11,200 --> 01:04:13,200
That was just lovely.

1214
01:04:13,200 --> 01:04:15,200
Alright.

1215
01:04:15,200 --> 01:04:17,200
I'm being hideous.

1216
01:04:17,200 --> 01:04:19,200
This love that I'm feeling

1217
01:04:19,200 --> 01:04:30,200
I wanna know, wanna know, wanna know now

1218
01:04:30,200 --> 01:04:38,200
I've got to know, got to know, got to know now

1219
01:04:38,200 --> 01:05:00,200
