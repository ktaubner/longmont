1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,580
(upbeat music)

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:09,880
- Yay!

3
00:00:09,880 --> 00:00:12,340
- Yay! - Clappington City.

4
00:00:12,340 --> 00:00:17,000
- So I saw this video that really, really was amazing.

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,200
I can't believe it's not the most popular video

6
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:20,720
of all time. - Can you pull it up?

7
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:22,280
- No, we can't show it on YouTube.

8
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:25,360
It's a guy, a dude, he's sitting on a chair

9
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:27,280
and he has one of his, you may have seen this,

10
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:29,680
he has one of his feet is bandaged

11
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:31,300
and it's like covered in blood.

12
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:34,020
And he's like, "All right, we're gonna try this again."

13
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:36,560
And his friend is like, "Okay, here we go."

14
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:39,080
And he has a revolver with one bullet in it,

15
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:41,140
and he spins it and shoots his other foot

16
00:00:41,140 --> 00:00:44,020
and shoots a hole through his other foot too.

17
00:00:44,020 --> 00:00:45,940
And it's the funniest video I've ever seen.

18
00:00:45,940 --> 00:00:49,860
This guy off camera, he shot one foot doing Russian roulette

19
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:51,860
and on camera, he shoots the other one.

20
00:00:51,860 --> 00:00:52,820
(laughing)

21
00:00:52,820 --> 00:00:53,660
- You have to show me.

22
00:00:53,660 --> 00:00:54,480
- You have to show me this video.

23
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:55,580
- Can you show me that on your phone?

24
00:00:55,580 --> 00:00:57,460
Just like pull it up. - I can't stop thinking about it.

25
00:00:57,460 --> 00:00:58,300
I don't even know if I can find it.

26
00:00:58,300 --> 00:01:01,880
- Can we pull it up on the screen and then just blur it out?

27
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:03,580
- No, no, this is a no-showing video show.

28
00:01:03,580 --> 00:01:04,780
- No, no, we don't show videos.

29
00:01:04,780 --> 00:01:06,340
- You're gonna be really scared later then.

30
00:01:06,340 --> 00:01:07,700
- We've learned, we've learned.

31
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:10,540
We do theater of the mind, we're back to theater of the mind.

32
00:01:10,540 --> 00:01:11,660
People don't like when we show--

33
00:01:11,660 --> 00:01:12,500
- When we show videos, yeah, we show--

34
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:14,120
- People don't like when we show stuff

35
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:15,540
and describe it perfectly.

36
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:16,380
- Yeah, with stuff like this.

37
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:18,900
- Where it's maybe even better than looking at it.

38
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:20,820
- Whoa, oh shit.

39
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:22,220
- People don't like that for some reason.

40
00:01:22,220 --> 00:01:24,060
- For some reason, people get mad at us

41
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:26,980
that we do a video podcast now,

42
00:01:26,980 --> 00:01:31,980
and they get mad that they have to listen to it as well.

43
00:01:31,980 --> 00:01:35,520
And I don't know why that happens.

44
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:38,340
Maybe it's just tastes change.

45
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:39,180
- Let's just let 'em go.

46
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:43,480
- Maybe some people really like it

47
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:45,820
and then some people really don't.

48
00:01:45,820 --> 00:01:47,160
And you have to toe the line

49
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:50,540
and you get a lot of rude messages in your DMs saying,

50
00:01:50,540 --> 00:01:52,620
"You look like shit on today's episode.

51
00:01:52,620 --> 00:01:54,680
"Your hair is falling out.

52
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:56,220
"Just shave it off, just shave it off."

53
00:01:56,220 --> 00:01:59,760
I can't shave it off, there's already a bald guy on the show.

54
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:01,180
I have to grow my hair back out

55
00:02:01,180 --> 00:02:03,000
'cause there's already a bald guy.

56
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,020
- Well, there's a guy with hair too,

57
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:04,860
so you're kinda caught in the middle.

58
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:05,700
- You're kinda copying me, right?

59
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:07,020
- You're coming to a rock and a hard place.

60
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:08,780
(laughing)

61
00:02:08,780 --> 00:02:11,780
- I get 100 messages a day that say,

62
00:02:11,780 --> 00:02:14,220
you look so bald today, you should kill yourself.

63
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:15,140
- Literally? - Well, that's funny

64
00:02:15,140 --> 00:02:16,820
'cause I get 100 messages today that say,

65
00:02:16,820 --> 00:02:19,340
I have 100 Bitcoin, I need you to manage it for me,

66
00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:20,620
please be the CEO of my corporation.

67
00:02:20,620 --> 00:02:23,660
- Yeah, and I also get the same ones that say,

68
00:02:23,660 --> 00:02:26,200
come click my profile, I'll make your butt come.

69
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:27,760
- Yeah, I don't like those.

70
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:28,600
- That's good messages to get.

71
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:29,580
- I'll make your butt come.

72
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:32,940
I'll say, hey lady, that's diarrhea.

73
00:02:32,940 --> 00:02:35,800
(laughing)

74
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:36,640
- I've been thinking a lot recently.

75
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:38,980
- That's not jizz, jizz isn't brown.

76
00:02:38,980 --> 00:02:40,060
- I've been thinking a lot recently about

77
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:43,740
why do you not, with those fishing Instagram accounts,

78
00:02:43,740 --> 00:02:44,940
where they, why is it always--

79
00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:46,620
- Yeah, the only fishing Instagram I follow

80
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:48,380
is Jimmy Houston Outdoors.

81
00:02:48,380 --> 00:02:49,480
- Yep, I saw that one.

82
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:52,500
A mile away, but I still liked it.

83
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:57,500
- Whenever I get messages from those accounts,

84
00:02:57,500 --> 00:02:59,600
it's always from an account,

85
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:02,320
and they're always called like Amanda1989 or something.

86
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:03,520
- Amanda Bobby.

87
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:05,560
- Why are you making it like--

88
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:06,700
- Stuff like that, fake names.

89
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:07,640
- Ruth Randy.

90
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:12,640
- It's always a man's first name as the last name.

91
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:15,460
So you get a message from Jessica Bruce.

92
00:03:15,460 --> 00:03:17,560
(laughing)

93
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:20,100
Jessica Bruce 66421.

94
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:22,120
And it's like, "Come see my pussy, come."

95
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:24,920
That's my problem though. Why are you even making up a fake name?

96
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:28,920
Just name it. Name your account Vagina or Diarrhea or something funny.

97
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:29,420
I did.

98
00:03:29,420 --> 00:03:30,720
Oh, that's interesting.

99
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:32,920
I got a really good one the other day.

100
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:36,820
Let me look it up because the name was stuck in my head.

101
00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:38,320
You keep going while I look for this.

102
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:39,120
He had a song.

103
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:41,820
I'm not going to keep going because if I start saying something,

104
00:03:41,820 --> 00:03:42,920
he'll say the name as soon as I start.

105
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:44,320
No, no, no. I'll wait till you're done.

106
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:45,220
I'll wait till you're done.

107
00:03:45,220 --> 00:03:46,420
No, no. You're right.

108
00:03:46,420 --> 00:03:51,720
We just have to do this exact level of conversation where neither of us really say anything.

109
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:53,220
- It's about to boil over.

110
00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:54,700
Oh, are we gonna move to another topic?

111
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:55,540
- No, we're not.

112
00:03:55,540 --> 00:03:56,360
- Oh, not yet.

113
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:58,060
- We're literally just filling air until he does this

114
00:03:58,060 --> 00:04:00,540
because as soon as I mention something about my life,

115
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:03,160
I just know that he's gonna say the name,

116
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:05,180
which is coming up very, very soon.

117
00:04:05,180 --> 00:04:06,700
- But maybe he won't be able to find it

118
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:08,860
until we try to change topics.

119
00:04:08,860 --> 00:04:10,300
- Oh, now I'm paralyzed.

120
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:13,420
- I was playing a game the other day.

121
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:14,460
- What were you playing?

122
00:04:14,460 --> 00:04:15,940
- I wasn't, I was trying to bait it out.

123
00:04:15,940 --> 00:04:16,780
- Yeah.

124
00:04:16,780 --> 00:04:17,600
- I was--

125
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,020
- You're in luck, it didn't show up.

126
00:04:19,020 --> 00:04:20,100
- Wow.

127
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:22,300
- That was a huge relief.

128
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:24,420
- Yeah, I stopped getting all of,

129
00:04:24,420 --> 00:04:27,300
I don't get sexual spam messages anymore.

130
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:29,680
I just get one, the copy and paste one,

131
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:32,500
it's a username and password,

132
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:33,540
and then an amount of Bitcoin.

133
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:35,820
It says, "Please help me manage this."

134
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:36,660
I get a hundred of those.

135
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:37,500
- Those are good, I like those ones.

136
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:38,320
- They're all, it's so funny,

137
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:40,300
they're all exactly the same.

138
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:42,300
And they don't even, like,

139
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:44,020
is it a bunch of different people

140
00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:45,500
who are copying and pasting the same thing,

141
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:47,580
or is it one person who's running it all

142
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:50,340
was no way to check if they've already messaged somebody,

143
00:04:50,340 --> 00:04:52,940
'cause I've probably gotten like 500 of those.

144
00:04:52,940 --> 00:04:53,780
You know what I mean?

145
00:04:53,780 --> 00:04:56,100
Like at what point am I gonna fall for the--

146
00:04:56,100 --> 00:04:57,580
- Yeah, what if you decided to like--

147
00:04:57,580 --> 00:04:59,260
- Yeah, maybe one of them's real.

148
00:04:59,260 --> 00:05:00,500
- Yeah.

149
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:01,500
- I guess. - Or maybe you get like

150
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:04,260
a fraction, like maybe you get like less Bitcoin

151
00:05:04,260 --> 00:05:05,100
than they promised. - But also,

152
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:06,380
the ones, they started to switch it up,

153
00:05:06,380 --> 00:05:08,500
but it used to be literally every time the username,

154
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:11,700
or in some way it would have the name Douglas in it.

155
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:12,660
- Yeah. - Yeah.

156
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:13,500
But now they switched it up, and now it's all--

157
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:14,900
- I would trust a Douglas, though.

158
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:15,900
- Yeah. - That's a very,

159
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:17,740
- They did market research, they figured out

160
00:05:17,740 --> 00:05:20,820
Douglas is the number one name for trusting.

161
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:22,580
- I guess Douglas is a last name.

162
00:05:22,580 --> 00:05:24,100
- Why Ruthie?

163
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:25,060
- I don't know.

164
00:05:25,060 --> 00:05:26,540
- Who's Ruthie?

165
00:05:26,540 --> 00:05:27,980
- Just the name that they pick.

166
00:05:27,980 --> 00:05:29,180
- I had an aunt Ruth.

167
00:05:29,180 --> 00:05:30,340
- I had a grandma Ruth.

168
00:05:30,340 --> 00:05:33,180
- I met her one time, similarly,

169
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:35,420
I met her one single time and she just got,

170
00:05:35,420 --> 00:05:37,300
she was so demented that she just started taking--

171
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:38,140
- Demented?

172
00:05:38,140 --> 00:05:39,420
- Yeah, she's demented.

173
00:05:39,420 --> 00:05:40,260
- Now it's not Douglas anymore.

174
00:05:40,260 --> 00:05:41,300
- She started taking off her clothes

175
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:42,420
right in front of me and my grandma.

176
00:05:42,420 --> 00:05:43,260
- That is actually fucking demented.

177
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:44,300
- She was just like, "Bah."

178
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:45,140

No, baby. What what are you talking about? I was a baby, and I saw boobs

190
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:39,540
Constantly yeah, everyone was taking him out everybody baby. You won't remember this

191
00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:42,740
I was at Mardi Gras handing out beads.

192
00:06:42,740 --> 00:06:44,740
They're like, "This is fine, nobody gives a fuck."

193
00:06:44,740 --> 00:06:46,740
"This is going to change his brain in any way."

194
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:55,740
Yeah, that's like how all those ladies used to go to Mardi Gras and do that back when cameras were just VHS tapes and stuff,

195
00:06:55,740 --> 00:06:57,740
and now all those videos are just on the internet.

196
00:06:57,740 --> 00:06:58,740
Yeah.

197
00:06:58,740 --> 00:06:59,740
I was basically...

198
00:06:59,740 --> 00:07:00,740
Girls Gone Wild, all of them.

199
00:07:00,740 --> 00:07:01,740
You remember it all.

200
00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:02,740
All those exploited women.

201
00:07:02,740 --> 00:07:03,740
Yeah.

202
00:07:03,740 --> 00:07:05,740
You were a child. You were Sherlock Holmes.

203
00:07:05,740 --> 00:07:06,740
Yeah, exactly.

204
00:07:06,740 --> 00:07:08,740
You had a photographic memory.

205
00:07:08,740 --> 00:07:14,260
memory perfect photographic memory I remember every single Marvy Gras tits and the boobs

206
00:07:14,260 --> 00:07:20,500
knocking on the doors of all the way yeah as a baby they see my eyes they go oh my god

207
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:26,740
oh my god he's imagining them right now. I just open the door I just smile

208
00:07:26,740 --> 00:07:33,380
I do have Sherlock Holmes like sitting back in a recliner with his hat and he's smoking a pipe

209
00:07:33,380 --> 00:07:37,620
and he has his eyes closed and he's just thinking of every naked woman he's ever saw in his life.

210
00:07:37,620 --> 00:07:42,500
It's actually so smart of them in the new Sherlock Holmes, or in the British one,

211
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:48,260
it's so smart of them to have made him gay because the idea of a straight Sherlock Holmes is like

212
00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:52,340
actually that's dangerous. Disquieting. Yeah, that is a scary, to say the very least.

213
00:07:52,340 --> 00:07:54,660
Motherfucker, Sherlock Holmes is always British.

214
00:07:54,660 --> 00:07:57,620
Damn. You know what I mean though.

215
00:07:57,620 --> 00:08:01,060
The British one, he's up in here saying the British one, I ain't seen an American one.

216
00:08:01,060 --> 00:08:03,060
Oh, actually, that is a good point.

217
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:04,060
[POP]

218
00:08:04,060 --> 00:08:05,060
[LAUGHTER]

219
00:08:05,060 --> 00:08:06,060
What was that?

220
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:07,940
No, that was a crazy mic bump.

221
00:08:07,940 --> 00:08:08,740
That sounded full--

222
00:08:08,740 --> 00:08:10,200
That was probably the best one yet.

223
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:11,860
That was Donkey Kong Country sound.

224
00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:13,100
That was good.

225
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:14,420
I liked that.

226
00:08:14,420 --> 00:08:16,580
But yeah, no, because a straight Sherlock Holmes

227
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:18,980
is like an actual-- that's like Jack the Ripper.

228
00:08:18,980 --> 00:08:19,580
Back in the--

229
00:08:19,580 --> 00:08:21,220
I'm straight Sherlock Holmes.

230
00:08:21,220 --> 00:08:22,740
1800s or whatever.

231
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:23,940
When's Sherlock Holmes from?

232
00:08:23,940 --> 00:08:25,180
When was he born?

233
00:08:25,180 --> 00:08:25,860
1800s, I think.

234
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:26,340
Yeah.

235
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:27,980
When was the real Sherlock Holmes from?

236
00:08:27,980 --> 00:08:29,860
Sherlock Holmes was fucking Watson's thighs.

237
00:08:29,860 --> 00:08:35,560
Huh he was fucking his thighs you know how to fuck butts back then no

238
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:41,780
If they did that it was a they had you used to have more sexual stuff, and it got all got away

239
00:08:41,780 --> 00:08:44,640
Yeah, it went away. What did we?

240
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:49,620
used to have more crazy sexual you're right actually that got cuz you

241
00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:54,340
Can shave your pubes back then

242
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:58,980
Could the amount of no you couldn't we're talking about caveman times right now

243
00:08:58,980 --> 00:09:04,300
You could shave them then - we couldn't know if you had a buddy with sharp teeth. We're talking about pre tools. Yeah

244
00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:07,380
mmm

245
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:16,860
Everyone who has a really fucked up sexual idea now. It's all they can use a machine or a toy to get it

246
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:19,900
Yep, what they now someone wants to fuck a dragon

247
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:22,980
They have a machine that was built to simulate you fucking a dragon

248
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:24,500
But if you wanted to fuck a dragon as a caveman

249
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:26,860
before they even made a wheel or fire,

250
00:09:26,860 --> 00:09:30,540
much less a rotating sawtooth fleshlight.

251
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:31,380
- Take it on a couple dates.

252
00:09:31,380 --> 00:09:32,540
- You have to go fuck a dragon.

253
00:09:32,540 --> 00:09:34,500
- You have to take that dragon on a couple dates.

254
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:36,380
- You have to invent a mythology

255
00:09:36,380 --> 00:09:39,220
that allows a person to have a dragon spirit inside them

256
00:09:39,220 --> 00:09:40,060
and then fuck them.

257
00:09:40,060 --> 00:09:42,060
- Did you guys think it was a little bit hot,

258
00:09:42,060 --> 00:09:43,500
the big dragon from Shrek?

259
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:46,220
- No.

260
00:09:46,220 --> 00:09:47,600
- No?

261
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:49,600
- Not even when she put lipstick on?

262
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:50,900
- No.

263
00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:51,820
- No?

264
00:09:51,820 --> 00:09:55,260
No, they could have stood to make her a little more sexual.

265
00:09:55,260 --> 00:09:56,340
They could have made her bustier.

266
00:09:56,340 --> 00:09:57,780
Not even a little bit, though.

267
00:09:57,780 --> 00:09:59,100
They could have made her bustier.

268
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:02,580
She was, but, bro, she weighed fucking 40,000 pounds.

269
00:10:02,580 --> 00:10:03,860
You can't get bustier than that.

270
00:10:03,860 --> 00:10:06,340
She didn't even have anything up there.

271
00:10:06,340 --> 00:10:07,740
She got wings, motherfucker.

272
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:10,900
If she was wearing a bra, I'd be like, damn.

273
00:10:10,900 --> 00:10:11,740
That's true.

274
00:10:11,740 --> 00:10:14,540
Any animal from any TV or movies,

275
00:10:14,540 --> 00:10:16,800
if they were in a bikini, I'd beat it.

276
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:17,780
(laughing)

277
00:10:17,780 --> 00:10:18,700
I'd beat it up.

278
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:20,900
I would beat it up.

279
00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:24,300
I'd beat up Rolly Polly Olly's mom heavily though.

280
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:25,780
- That's just shapes.

281
00:10:25,780 --> 00:10:26,620
- That's not an animal.

282
00:10:26,620 --> 00:10:28,380
- That's what I'm talking about.

283
00:10:28,380 --> 00:10:29,820
It doesn't even have to be an animal.

284
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:31,020
It could just be shapes.

285
00:10:31,020 --> 00:10:31,860
- It's just shapes.

286
00:10:31,860 --> 00:10:32,680
- For a guy like me.

287
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:33,520
- Just shapes.

288
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:35,620
- Think about it, Rolly Polly Olly's mom,

289
00:10:35,620 --> 00:10:37,420
she's like two circles.

290
00:10:37,420 --> 00:10:38,260
- What are boobs?

291
00:10:38,260 --> 00:10:39,080
- She's fine actually.

292
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:39,920
- Two circles.

293
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:41,740
- Shapes are, it's less,

294
00:10:41,740 --> 00:10:43,620
I think it's easier to admit you'd fuck a shape

295
00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:44,460
than an animal.

296
00:10:44,460 --> 00:10:45,900
- Oh yeah.

297
00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:48,060
- And you gay as hell if you fuck in a square.

298
00:10:48,060 --> 00:10:48,980
- Let's talk about it then.

299
00:10:48,980 --> 00:10:51,020
Let's say that, let's get that on the record.

300
00:10:51,020 --> 00:10:52,140
Let's go to that square.

301
00:10:52,140 --> 00:10:54,140
All at the same time, number one shape.

302
00:10:54,140 --> 00:10:54,980
3, 2, 1.

303
00:10:54,980 --> 00:10:56,420
Circle.

304
00:10:56,420 --> 00:10:57,820
Wow.

305
00:10:57,820 --> 00:11:01,300
OK, so we have very similar tastes as men.

306
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:03,180
OK, number two.

307
00:11:03,180 --> 00:11:03,680
Ready?

308
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:05,940
But I'll fuck a triangle if I need to.

309
00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:06,700
Number one animal.

310
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:07,940
I'll fuck a triangle, maybe.

311
00:11:07,940 --> 00:11:09,660
Wait, just number one animal in general?

312
00:11:09,660 --> 00:11:10,820
Number one animal.

313
00:11:10,820 --> 00:11:11,500
No time to think.

314
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:12,460
3, 2, 1.

315
00:11:12,460 --> 00:11:14,860
Alligator.

316
00:11:14,860 --> 00:11:16,580
Well, I was still thinking about triangle.

317
00:11:16,580 --> 00:11:17,580
We all said monkey.

318
00:11:17,580 --> 00:11:20,700
Alright, I may have said bee.

319
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:23,020
I said bug, so you're a copier.

320
00:11:23,020 --> 00:11:25,860
No, it's a different, you didn't specify what kind of bee.

321
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:27,860
All bugs count as my domain.

322
00:11:27,860 --> 00:11:29,140
Okay, all bugs.

323
00:11:29,140 --> 00:11:31,580
Okay, then I would fuck a simpson.

324
00:11:31,580 --> 00:11:32,580
I don't know.

325
00:11:32,580 --> 00:11:34,020
A simpson isn't an animal.

326
00:11:34,020 --> 00:11:37,620
That's the only human that's not an animal.

327
00:11:37,620 --> 00:11:39,500
You can't do simpson.

328
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:42,940
Every human in the world is an animal except for toons.

329
00:11:42,940 --> 00:11:43,940
You can't pick a simpson.

330
00:11:43,940 --> 00:11:45,940
- That is less animal than ant-

331
00:11:45,940 --> 00:11:46,780
- No.

332
00:11:46,780 --> 00:11:48,260
- They didn't evolve from monkeys.

333
00:11:48,260 --> 00:11:50,100
- They were entirely human.

334
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:51,780
- They have no DNA.

335
00:11:51,780 --> 00:11:52,620
- They have DNA.

336
00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:54,060
- No, they're toons.

337
00:11:54,060 --> 00:11:55,860
- Drawing and animation.

338
00:11:55,860 --> 00:11:56,980
- They do.

339
00:11:56,980 --> 00:11:57,820
- Mate.

340
00:11:57,820 --> 00:12:00,260
- They do have DNA.

341
00:12:00,260 --> 00:12:02,140
- My mate thinks Simpsons have DNA.

342
00:12:02,140 --> 00:12:04,460
- My mate thinks that a Simpson has a genome.

343
00:12:04,460 --> 00:12:06,100
- My mate thinks a Simpson is vulnerable.

344
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:08,620
- They just finished sequencing the Simpson genome.

345
00:12:08,620 --> 00:12:09,460
(laughing)

346
00:12:09,460 --> 00:12:11,860
- The Simpson evolutionary line.

347
00:12:11,860 --> 00:12:16,860
- We can finally repair the old age of Mr. Burns.

348
00:12:16,860 --> 00:12:22,820
We can get the wheelchair characters out of the wheelchairs.

349
00:12:22,820 --> 00:12:25,180
- We'll finally solve that problem with Apu.

350
00:12:25,180 --> 00:12:26,020
- Yep.

351
00:12:26,020 --> 00:12:26,840
- Yep.

352
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:27,680
- What's the problem?

353
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:28,520
- What's the problem with Apu?

354
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:29,700
- Too funny.

355
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:30,640
- That is true.

356
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:35,420
- We're gonna figure out birth defects like little Lisa,

357
00:12:35,420 --> 00:12:37,280
Maggie, whatever her name is,

358
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:39,540
the small one who can't talk, Simpson.

359
00:12:39,540 --> 00:12:40,920
- What was the problem with Apu?

360
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:46,460
I never watched that movie the problem the poo is it's racial. He wasn't very good at his job

361
00:12:46,460 --> 00:12:53,720
Yeah, I think that he was yeah, just kind of was just kind of annoying just yeah, and he was wasting time

362
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:59,960
Yeah, the problem with the poo is that he was a vegetarian and he was pushing his fucking beliefs on to Lisa

363
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:03,000
He was rude to Homer - he was rude to Homer

364
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:07,440
There's one art some another problem with the poo was rude to all the characters at least once basically

365
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:10,180
- Apparently there's a laundry list of problems with Apu

366
00:13:10,180 --> 00:13:13,160
that they, I mean, they only scratched the surface

367
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:14,000
in that movie.

368
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,420
- I'm not sure there's any character who's been as rude

369
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:17,760
to every character in a show.

370
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:20,540
- They really, they only scratched the damn surface

371
00:13:20,540 --> 00:13:21,380
with those problems.

372
00:13:21,380 --> 00:13:23,200
- Here's the problem with Apu, he has that one episode

373
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:25,340
where he has like 15 kids and none of them,

374
00:13:25,340 --> 00:13:26,620
we never see them again.

375
00:13:26,620 --> 00:13:27,460
There's a problem right there.

376
00:13:27,460 --> 00:13:29,480
- Doesn't he keep them in a dresser?

377
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:30,780
- I don't, there's one other problem.

378
00:13:30,780 --> 00:13:31,620
That's cruel.

379
00:13:31,620 --> 00:13:32,440
- Oh my god.

380
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:36,800
- That's cruel and, that's like psychopathic parental abuse.

381
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:38,760
- Yeah. - Yeah.

382
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:40,600
- Although every parent used to do that, supposedly.

383
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:44,440
- Pretty much every Simpsons parent is an abuser.

384
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:47,040
- They should call Cruel and Unusual Punishment Cup.

385
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:48,000
They should just say Cup.

386
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,280
- Homer strangles his son.

387
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:51,840
Cup is good. - Cup.

388
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:53,240
- Homer strangles his kid.

389
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:55,760
- If they made The Simpsons today--

390
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:57,080
- Yeah. - Here's the horrible thing.

391
00:13:57,080 --> 00:13:57,920
If they made The Simpsons today--

392
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:59,840
- Moe has a kid. - Moe doesn't have a kid.

393
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:00,680
- Shut up.

394
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:02,360
If they made The Simpsons today,

395
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:04,920
Homer would be strangling Lisa.

396
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:05,760
- Yep.

397
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:07,120
How awful is that to think about?

398
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:07,960
That's way worse.

399
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:08,800
Wait, why?

400
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:09,620
Because of equality.

401
00:14:09,620 --> 00:14:10,460
Because of equality and because of--

402
00:14:10,460 --> 00:14:13,360
But you wouldn't be strangling them both or just Lisa?

403
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:14,200
Just Lisa.

404
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:15,040
Has he ever strangled Lisa?

405
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:15,860
'Cause I guess you have to balance it out.

406
00:14:15,860 --> 00:14:18,600
There's been, there's 100 years of Homer strangling part.

407
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:20,760
Yeah, if you used to strangle a guy,

408
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:21,960
now you're strangling a girl because of--

409
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:22,800
Switch it up.

410
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:23,640
Because of woke--

411
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:24,460
SJW culture.

412
00:14:24,460 --> 00:14:25,300
Switch it up, yeah.

413
00:14:25,300 --> 00:14:26,700
If Simpsons go woke,

414
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:29,200
I'm gonna go broke-- I hate to say it,

415
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:30,040
I think they've gone a little woke.

416
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:31,640
My neck on a chair in a--

417
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:33,840
The Simpsons went woke?

418
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:35,100
Mate. Don't tell me.

419
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:38,020
- Mate, you're pulling my tit, mate.

420
00:14:38,020 --> 00:14:41,420
- I heard that they're gonna change all the Simpsons,

421
00:14:41,420 --> 00:14:42,380
instead of being yellow,

422
00:14:42,380 --> 00:14:44,780
they're gonna change them to real life skin colors.

423
00:14:44,780 --> 00:14:46,120
- And every single shade.

424
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:46,960
- All of them.

425
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:47,940
- Oh God.

426
00:14:47,940 --> 00:14:49,380
- You're pulling my bloody tit.

427
00:14:49,380 --> 00:14:50,380
- I'm not.

428
00:14:50,380 --> 00:14:53,540
- So you're saying that we will have a mixed race Simpsons.

429
00:14:53,540 --> 00:14:54,380
- Yes.

430
00:14:54,380 --> 00:14:55,420
- Because of woke?

431
00:14:55,420 --> 00:14:56,460
- Because of wokeness.

432
00:14:56,460 --> 00:14:58,940
- That's PC culture gone mad.

433
00:14:58,940 --> 00:14:59,780
- It is completely gone mad.

434
00:14:59,780 --> 00:15:02,240
- Next thing you know, they're gonna start drawing

435
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:04,380
an extra finger for the Simpsons.

436
00:15:04,380 --> 00:15:06,060
- Don't even think of that.

437
00:15:06,060 --> 00:15:07,220
- Wokeness gone amok.

438
00:15:07,220 --> 00:15:11,580
I've been following a very funny wokeness saga

439
00:15:11,580 --> 00:15:13,900
that I usually, this kind of stuff I don't even notice

440
00:15:13,900 --> 00:15:16,380
or pay attention to 'cause I'm kind of just above politics.

441
00:15:16,380 --> 00:15:17,220
- Yep.

442
00:15:17,220 --> 00:15:18,040
- In general.

443
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:18,880
- I've since never heard that about you.

444
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:19,720
- I know that about time.

445
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:20,540
All you think about is Tom and Jerry.

446
00:15:20,540 --> 00:15:22,300
- There has been a crisis of wokeness

447
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:24,300
in a certain nerd community

448
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:26,380
that has been really making me giggle

449
00:15:26,380 --> 00:15:28,340
and it's in Magic the Gathering.

450
00:15:28,340 --> 00:15:29,180
- Okay.

451
00:15:29,180 --> 00:15:31,020
- They're releasing, it's gone woke, first of all.

452
00:15:31,020 --> 00:15:32,040
It's been woke for a minute.

453
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:32,880
- Can we just have just a moment there?

454
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:33,900
- And I've been on the forefront of this issue.

455
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:41,180
It has been woke. But they apparently, according to the anti-woke fans of Magic the Gathering,

456
00:15:41,180 --> 00:15:42,180
it has crossed a line.

457
00:15:42,180 --> 00:15:46,580
What's the percentage wise? What do you think the anti-woke MTG fans are?

458
00:15:46,580 --> 00:15:51,940
I could give you an actual number. They have a subreddit. They have a separate subreddit

459
00:15:51,940 --> 00:15:56,460
because they've all been banned from the main Magic the Gathering subreddit.

460
00:15:56,460 --> 00:16:01,580
Let's get the number of the Magic the Gathering members and then the anti-woke Magic members.

461
00:16:01,580 --> 00:16:03,580
- So the main Magic the Gathering subreddit

462
00:16:03,580 --> 00:16:06,580
has 631,000 members.

463
00:16:06,580 --> 00:16:07,420
- Okay, it's kinda lower than I thought, honestly.

464
00:16:07,420 --> 00:16:08,260
- Big group, big group.

465
00:16:08,260 --> 00:16:09,080
- I thought that'd be in the millions.

466
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:11,380
- And then the racist Magic the Gathering subreddit--

467
00:16:11,380 --> 00:16:12,340
- Is it called racist Magic?

468
00:16:12,340 --> 00:16:13,540
- It's called Free Magic.

469
00:16:13,540 --> 00:16:14,380
- Free Magic, okay.

470
00:16:14,380 --> 00:16:16,140
- And it has 24,000 members.

471
00:16:16,140 --> 00:16:17,100
(laughing)

472
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:18,660
- That's pretty good, actually.

473
00:16:18,660 --> 00:16:20,300
- Pretty decent proportion.

474
00:16:20,300 --> 00:16:21,140
- What do you have?

475
00:16:21,140 --> 00:16:21,960
- But, so--

476
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:23,300
- So those are all, wait, so those are all the people

477
00:16:23,300 --> 00:16:24,980
who have been banned, so they can't--

478
00:16:24,980 --> 00:16:27,020
- They haven't all been banned, but they hate the--

479
00:16:27,020 --> 00:16:27,860
- But they're anti, yeah.

480
00:16:27,860 --> 00:16:28,820
- They're anti, yeah. - Magic.

481
00:16:28,820 --> 00:16:30,940
But so the thing that happened is they're making

482
00:16:30,940 --> 00:16:33,060
a Lord of the Rings set for Magic the Gathering

483
00:16:33,060 --> 00:16:35,240
and they have made Aragorn black.

484
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:39,600
And it has sent the racist Magic the Gathering fans

485
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:42,420
into the biggest tizzy I've ever seen in my life.

486
00:16:42,420 --> 00:16:43,460
And the thing that was made,

487
00:16:43,460 --> 00:16:45,860
they have been making really racist

488
00:16:45,860 --> 00:16:48,500
custom Magic the Gathering cards

489
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:49,540
where they'll try, they're like,

490
00:16:49,540 --> 00:16:50,980
to try and prove their point,

491
00:16:50,980 --> 00:16:52,500
they'll make cards that are like,

492
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:53,820
this is how Aragorn should look.

493
00:16:53,820 --> 00:16:55,580
And it's like a white guy.

494
00:16:55,580 --> 00:16:57,820
But the best one I saw,

495
00:16:57,820 --> 00:17:01,820
- The best one that I saw was a custom card

496
00:17:01,820 --> 00:17:03,900
that they made called Pander.

497
00:17:03,900 --> 00:17:08,140
It was like a spell, like a spell on the effect said,

498
00:17:08,140 --> 00:17:09,940
all white creatures become black.

499
00:17:09,940 --> 00:17:12,660
(laughing)

500
00:17:12,660 --> 00:17:14,940
And I probably wouldn't, I wouldn't go on this subreddit

501
00:17:14,940 --> 00:17:17,860
or show it on YouTube because they really get

502
00:17:17,860 --> 00:17:19,900
extremely, extremely racist.

503
00:17:19,900 --> 00:17:20,740
- Really? - Yeah.

504
00:17:20,740 --> 00:17:22,460
- They take it to a whole other level.

505
00:17:22,460 --> 00:17:25,580
- They made Beetlejuice into Ericorn.

506
00:17:25,580 --> 00:17:27,020
- Okay, I would watch that though.

507
00:17:27,020 --> 00:17:28,820
That I need to see.

508
00:17:28,820 --> 00:17:29,620
I would see that.

509
00:17:29,620 --> 00:17:31,480
I need to see that really bad.

510
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:32,700
Yeah, that sounds amazing.

511
00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:34,260
Yeah, but that's just a kind of a

512
00:17:34,260 --> 00:17:36,220
wokeness report for the week.

513
00:17:36,220 --> 00:17:37,220
That's what's going on right now.

514
00:17:37,220 --> 00:17:38,760
Speaking of that, so you had like,

515
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:40,360
we were talking about the things that we

516
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:42,900
like look at to like, remind us like,

517
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:46,000
oh yeah, there's a lot of fucking shit online.

518
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,300
I tried to get into iFunny.

519
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:49,340
We were talking about, remember,

520
00:17:49,340 --> 00:17:51,740
you were like, the racist magic thing.

521
00:17:51,740 --> 00:17:54,700
And I was like, yeah, I've also been looking at iFunny.

522
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:56,900
And it's the most racist.

523
00:17:56,900 --> 00:17:58,420
website of all time.

524
00:17:58,420 --> 00:18:01,980
- It's pretty crazy how racist some people get.

525
00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:02,820
- Yeah.

526
00:18:02,820 --> 00:18:05,020
- Just when you put them all in a room together.

527
00:18:05,020 --> 00:18:07,420
(laughing)

528
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:10,020
It's really funny, 'cause you know that the people,

529
00:18:10,020 --> 00:18:11,460
at least on the Magic the Gathering,

530
00:18:11,460 --> 00:18:14,640
these are people who, they're going to a tabletop

531
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:17,660
gaming store, and they're sitting down to play a tournament,

532
00:18:17,660 --> 00:18:19,380
and they're either not talking to anyone,

533
00:18:19,380 --> 00:18:21,300
or they're saying, "I hate Magic the Gathering,

534
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:22,260
"it's been woke."

535
00:18:22,260 --> 00:18:25,220
And everyone's like, "Okay, we also are nerds,

536
00:18:25,220 --> 00:18:26,820
and we don't want to talk to you.

537
00:18:26,820 --> 00:18:30,020
But then you get them all together and they go crazy.

538
00:18:30,020 --> 00:18:34,220
- I don't think there's anyone at a tabletop game store,

539
00:18:34,220 --> 00:18:36,780
I don't think there's anyone going to play Magic the Gathering

540
00:18:36,780 --> 00:18:38,380
who's in the middle.

541
00:18:38,380 --> 00:18:43,140
I think that it's like, there's two camps in the store,

542
00:18:43,140 --> 00:18:45,740
there's the freaking blue hair SJW types

543
00:18:45,740 --> 00:18:49,140
and then the other guys who are completely racist as hell.

544
00:18:49,140 --> 00:18:51,420
- If you're into it enough to go to the store to play

545
00:18:51,420 --> 00:18:52,980
instead of just playing it at home,

546
00:18:52,980 --> 00:18:54,740
I think you have to pick a side.

547
00:18:54,740 --> 00:18:55,240
Yeah.

548
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:56,540
You have to pick a side in the war.

549
00:18:56,540 --> 00:18:59,020
And there's going to be a huge--

550
00:18:59,020 --> 00:19:01,140
you're going to go to the game castle in Londonderry,

551
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:01,640
New Hampshire.

552
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:04,580
You're going to see one side of the room, blue hair, SJW.

553
00:19:04,580 --> 00:19:06,700
They're going to have sharpened logs in the middle.

554
00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:09,740
The other side, guy in full SS uniform.

555
00:19:09,740 --> 00:19:10,900
Yeah.

556
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:12,020
I would-- I think that--

557
00:19:12,020 --> 00:19:12,520
He's like--

558
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:13,020
--nerds.

559
00:19:13,020 --> 00:19:15,540
No, it's because I'm playing a different game.

560
00:19:15,540 --> 00:19:17,260
I'm not playing Magic.

561
00:19:17,260 --> 00:19:18,300
I'm playing Risk.

562
00:19:18,300 --> 00:19:22,300
And yes, it's Risk 1942.

563
00:19:22,300 --> 00:19:24,380
I'd like to be in the middle of those two groups.

564
00:19:24,380 --> 00:19:27,740
empty out AK-47 automatic rifles at both of them.

565
00:19:27,740 --> 00:19:30,180
- I like to think that I bridge the gap.

566
00:19:30,180 --> 00:19:31,220
- Between the...

567
00:19:31,220 --> 00:19:33,460
- I'm basically half SJW.

568
00:19:33,460 --> 00:19:34,300
- Half racist.

569
00:19:34,300 --> 00:19:35,140
- I'm racist as fuck.

570
00:19:35,140 --> 00:19:36,700
(laughing)

571
00:19:36,700 --> 00:19:39,420
- And I kind of bridge the gap between the two cultures.

572
00:19:39,420 --> 00:19:41,940
- The worst part of the racist Magic the Gathering subreddit

573
00:19:41,940 --> 00:19:43,680
is like, I would say about half of it is like,

574
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:45,700
truly some of the most obscenely racist,

575
00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:47,300
like just actual Nazis. - But then some of it...

576
00:19:47,300 --> 00:19:50,180
- But half of it is just people who are not racist,

577
00:19:50,180 --> 00:19:51,900
but or at least are secretly racist

578
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:53,420
and don't say it out loud.

579
00:19:53,420 --> 00:19:55,740
but are just actual, actual nerds who are like,

580
00:19:55,740 --> 00:19:57,720
Wizards of the Coast is devaluing the game

581
00:19:57,720 --> 00:19:58,820
by printing too many cards.

582
00:19:58,820 --> 00:20:00,100
And I'm like, oh, you're right.

583
00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:01,820
- Yeah, they're making a good point.

584
00:20:01,820 --> 00:20:02,780
- They're making good points.

585
00:20:02,780 --> 00:20:05,940
And then I scroll their next post and it's like,

586
00:20:05,940 --> 00:20:06,980
something really bad.

587
00:20:06,980 --> 00:20:08,380
(laughing)

588
00:20:08,380 --> 00:20:09,220
- That's the other thing.

589
00:20:09,220 --> 00:20:10,060
- A really crazy drawing.

590
00:20:10,060 --> 00:20:11,780
- There's definitely plenty of like,

591
00:20:11,780 --> 00:20:13,780
black nerds who play Magic the Gathering

592
00:20:13,780 --> 00:20:15,580
who probably also are like,

593
00:20:15,580 --> 00:20:16,940
Irigorne is not black.

594
00:20:16,940 --> 00:20:19,020
(laughing)

595
00:20:19,020 --> 00:20:21,100
Like, can you imagine if they'd redesign,

596
00:20:21,100 --> 00:20:24,740
- Imagine the fury of the black nerd community

597
00:20:24,740 --> 00:20:26,900
if they did a re-release of Dragon Ball Z

598
00:20:26,900 --> 00:20:28,780
and made Goku black.

599
00:20:28,780 --> 00:20:30,260
- No, I don't think-- - No, they'd like that.

600
00:20:30,260 --> 00:20:31,100
- You think they'd like that?

601
00:20:31,100 --> 00:20:31,920
- I think they'd love that.

602
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:33,700
- I think they'd be pretty mad, dude.

603
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:36,860
- I mean, there's already, like, if you just walk down--

604
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:38,180
- There's a car that drives around here

605
00:20:38,180 --> 00:20:39,500
with the license plate, Black Goku.

606
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:40,420
- Yeah. - Wait, really?

607
00:20:40,420 --> 00:20:41,440
- Yeah. - Well, introducing him

608
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:43,620
as a different character, that's a great idea.

609
00:20:43,620 --> 00:20:44,940
- Yeah. - Black Goku?

610
00:20:44,940 --> 00:20:45,780
- Black Goku shows up. - You're sounding a lot

611
00:20:45,780 --> 00:20:48,860
like a Free Magic member right now.

612
00:20:48,860 --> 00:20:51,060
- And if you made a different character, it'd be okay.

613
00:20:51,060 --> 00:20:56,060
- If you made a different card called Black Aragorn,

614
00:20:56,060 --> 00:20:58,580
this would all be fine.

615
00:20:58,580 --> 00:21:00,180
- Yeah, that's a great idea.

616
00:21:00,180 --> 00:21:01,020
- They literally are like, yeah, but they have to.

617
00:21:01,020 --> 00:21:02,620
- Yeah, they should at least make a special version

618
00:21:02,620 --> 00:21:04,580
that has a white Aragorn on it.

619
00:21:04,580 --> 00:21:05,740
- Oh my god. - It's a good idea.

620
00:21:05,740 --> 00:21:06,980
- Well, that's the thing now,

621
00:21:06,980 --> 00:21:08,420
is it would be called White Aragorn.

622
00:21:08,420 --> 00:21:09,260
- Yeah. - Goddamn.

623
00:21:09,260 --> 00:21:11,340
- Yeah, then you'd have to have,

624
00:21:11,340 --> 00:21:12,740
no one wants to be left out,

625
00:21:12,740 --> 00:21:15,820
you'd have to have Chinese Aragorn, Japanese Aragorn,

626
00:21:15,820 --> 00:21:19,260
Korean Aragorn, pretty much every single one of the races.

627
00:21:19,260 --> 00:21:20,100
- It's so funny, they also,

628
00:21:20,100 --> 00:21:22,060
Yeah, Japanese and green, that's what you--

629
00:21:22,060 --> 00:21:23,480
I didn't say green, I said Korean.

630
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:25,020
Oh, they said green.

631
00:21:25,020 --> 00:21:27,780
Yeah, Chinese, Japanese, green.

632
00:21:27,780 --> 00:21:31,940
I don't know why I only picked Asian-specific races.

633
00:21:31,940 --> 00:21:33,820
I could have gone, I could have said Indian,

634
00:21:33,820 --> 00:21:35,580
I could have said any other race.

635
00:21:35,580 --> 00:21:36,460
This guy knows every--

636
00:21:36,460 --> 00:21:37,740
You think Indians aren't Asian.

637
00:21:37,740 --> 00:21:39,780
I'm going to make a list of every race.

638
00:21:39,780 --> 00:21:41,300
I love getting him into a corner.

639
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:41,800
We got you.

640
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:43,260
I'm going to get every single race.

641
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:45,340
We have your list of every race right over there.

642
00:21:45,340 --> 00:21:47,980
And then, OK, so you want to pull that over and then just

643
00:21:47,980 --> 00:21:50,180
put the word Aragorn next to all of them.

644
00:21:50,180 --> 00:21:53,540
They also, they can't control themselves at all,

645
00:21:53,540 --> 00:21:55,840
where they get really mad about black Aragorn,

646
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:57,500
and then you look at the comments,

647
00:21:57,500 --> 00:21:58,340
and they're all like,

648
00:21:58,340 --> 00:21:59,260
"Yeah, and they're probably gonna make

649
00:21:59,260 --> 00:22:01,180
Aragorn fucking trans too."

650
00:22:01,180 --> 00:22:03,580
And it's like, "Well, they didn't, you guys."

651
00:22:03,580 --> 00:22:04,420
- Yeah.

652
00:22:04,420 --> 00:22:05,240
- You guys are--

653
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:06,080
- Well, you never know, could be coming out one day.

654
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:07,780
- They have, yeah, I mean, it's just so funny

655
00:22:07,780 --> 00:22:09,360
to have something right in front of them

656
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:11,300
that they're so mad at, and they get so mad,

657
00:22:11,300 --> 00:22:13,260
they forget what they're even,

658
00:22:13,260 --> 00:22:14,260
and start yelling about something.

659
00:22:14,260 --> 00:22:17,140
- I'm thinking of doing an SJW reboot of this show.

660
00:22:17,140 --> 00:22:22,460
Yeah, I think that could do numbers. Do you think I would look good with like a blue like Skrillex cut?

661
00:22:22,460 --> 00:22:30,480
Yeah, in the SJW thing you two are not involved by the way. No if anyone's not involved in the SJW thing

662
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:37,640
It's you. Yeah, what are you talking about? I'm the most SJW of them all. No, not a chance. I'm more SJW than any

663
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:40,260
black or lesbian or

664
00:22:40,260 --> 00:22:44,580
Any other kind of person? Okay boomer. Bro chill

665
00:22:44,580 --> 00:22:54,380
See, that's an SJW kind of way. A little more like surfer. Yeah. No, dude. No, I'm an SJW.

666
00:22:54,380 --> 00:23:00,620
Ask me any SJW question, I'll answer it perfectly. Okay, here's one. I'm super SJW. What gender?

667
00:23:00,620 --> 00:23:07,180
Oh yeah, wait, how many genders are there? Four.

668
00:23:07,180 --> 00:23:08,760
(laughing)

669
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:09,960
- 365?

670
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:11,000
(laughing)

671
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:11,840
- Fuck.

672
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:14,220
- Okay, ask me another one, ask me another one.

673
00:23:14,220 --> 00:23:16,780
- How many races are there?

674
00:23:16,780 --> 00:23:17,860
- Oh, I know that one.

675
00:23:17,860 --> 00:23:18,700
- This is easy.

676
00:23:18,700 --> 00:23:19,520
- Yeah.

677
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:20,360
- Three.

678
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:21,180
- No.

679
00:23:21,180 --> 00:23:22,020
- Fuck.

680
00:23:22,020 --> 00:23:22,860
- 16.

681
00:23:22,860 --> 00:23:23,680
- Shit.

682
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:25,200
- 16 races and ethnicities.

683
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:27,620
- Well, okay, then their subclasses are ethnicity.

684
00:23:27,620 --> 00:23:29,340
- Subclasses.

685
00:23:29,340 --> 00:23:30,620
Okay, ask me another one.

686
00:23:30,620 --> 00:23:31,460
- Okay.

687
00:23:31,460 --> 00:23:33,660
- Any SJW question I can answer except for those last two.

688
00:23:33,660 --> 00:23:36,680
- San Jose Whalers.

689
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:37,840
- You're not saying anything.

690
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:38,680
- What?

691
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:39,680
- What is that, what could that be?

692
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:42,000
- You're just useless, ask me a question.

693
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:45,480
- What politics are good to have?

694
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:47,300
- Okay, that was my next question.

695
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:54,860
- Socialistic communism.

696
00:23:54,860 --> 00:23:57,160
Where, with--

697
00:23:57,160 --> 00:24:00,040
- No, it's actually socialist anarchy.

698
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:00,880
- Oh, okay.

699
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:01,840
- Is the type of good politics.

700
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:03,080
- No, I'm an SJW.

701
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:05,400
I think it's completely normal to put Christians in camps

702
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:06,240
and kill them.

703
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:13,260
I really think I'm an SJW and I think that standing in line for what a slice of bread. Yeah, that's good. Yeah

704
00:24:13,260 --> 00:24:16,800
Yeah, as long as that bread is gluten-free. I actually like

705
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:23,440
Living stacked on top of each other with my neighbors like sardines in a city where every comedy has sing-songy punchlines

706
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:29,240
Yeah, and and I love queers and bugs taste good. Yeah, I want to eat bugs. Yeah

707
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:34,220
Yeah, my pod is awesome. I like PB&J. Yeah. Yeah

708
00:24:34,220 --> 00:24:45,340
Yeah. And fuck it. I say I like Mac and cheese too. Yeah. Fuck me. I guess I'm an SJW. Yeah.

709
00:24:45,340 --> 00:24:52,380
No. I do like to with the crust cut off. Chai latte. That. Okay. That is my number one food.

710
00:24:52,380 --> 00:25:01,900
I'm better. That's a child latte and a slice of pineapple pizza. The crust. Yep. That's

711
00:25:01,900 --> 00:25:02,900
J.W.

712
00:25:02,900 --> 00:25:05,900
That is the best meal.

713
00:25:05,900 --> 00:25:13,900
They're probably going to do what's the next next thing they're going to

714
00:25:13,900 --> 00:25:15,900
woke if I probably or is that over?

715
00:25:15,900 --> 00:25:18,900
I think I do think it might go the opposite direction soon

716
00:25:18,900 --> 00:25:20,900
where they start and they'll maybe do the NFL.

717
00:25:20,900 --> 00:25:23,900
They'll put spikes on their heads and stuff and make it murder.

718
00:25:23,900 --> 00:25:27,900
Oh, yeah, I think basically they're going to reveal that America is a

719
00:25:27,900 --> 00:25:29,900
is a fucking fourth reich.

720
00:25:29,900 --> 00:25:31,340
- Shit, maybe. - Has been all along.

721
00:25:31,340 --> 00:25:32,180
- Or fuck me, I mean.

722
00:25:32,180 --> 00:25:33,540
- China and Russia will team up

723
00:25:33,540 --> 00:25:35,480
and they will become a new country.

724
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:36,660
- Mate, you better be-- - Called what?

725
00:25:36,660 --> 00:25:38,260
- Rhina.

726
00:25:38,260 --> 00:25:39,420
- Rhina.

727
00:25:39,420 --> 00:25:41,780
- And they will fight against America.

728
00:25:41,780 --> 00:25:43,500
- You better be, you better be.

729
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:44,900
- Oh, do I have a crystal ball under the table?

730
00:25:44,900 --> 00:25:46,100
- You better be mucking about.

731
00:25:46,100 --> 00:25:46,940
- Let me look.

732
00:25:46,940 --> 00:25:47,780
- You better be mucking about.

733
00:25:47,780 --> 00:25:48,620
- Oh, his penis is out!

734
00:25:48,620 --> 00:25:49,460
(laughing)

735
00:25:49,460 --> 00:25:50,620
Oh, God, don't look.

736
00:25:50,620 --> 00:25:52,700
- And it is completely clear.

737
00:25:52,700 --> 00:25:53,700
It is crystalline.

738
00:25:53,700 --> 00:25:55,340
- Yeah, it's never seen the--

739
00:25:55,340 --> 00:25:57,020
- Yeah, but we're looking at a pretty huge war

740
00:25:57,020 --> 00:26:05,260
in the next two weeks. I believe that. Yeah, I think that also the some of the smaller countries

741
00:26:05,260 --> 00:26:11,460
will also combine. They will follow the example of China and Russia. It is so funny that like

742
00:26:11,460 --> 00:26:14,940
any time Putin... It'll be exactly like that. We're looking at guys, a lot of people are

743
00:26:14,940 --> 00:26:17,940
saying that soon there will be a new world order with a global government, but you guys

744
00:26:17,940 --> 00:26:21,980
are completely wrong. There's going to be seven countries and each country is a continent.

745
00:26:21,980 --> 00:26:26,080
And I hope it's just new order. I hope it's a damn new order concert. It's so dope that

746
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:28,960
- Every time Putin talks about America,

747
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:31,680
or any of those Russian officials talk about America,

748
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:36,240
they always bring up the fact that America is wokey SJW now.

749
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:37,080
That is so cool.

750
00:26:37,080 --> 00:26:37,920
- What is it?

751
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:39,440
- If we end up going to war with them,

752
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:44,440
and they're like, we have to eliminate the SJW scourge,

753
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:46,560
and that's why they come to America

754
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:48,920
and start killing people, that'd be so fucking cool.

755
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:51,560
- What is it, in France, when they complain about it,

756
00:26:51,560 --> 00:26:54,560
like the word for woke is le woke-ism.

757
00:26:54,560 --> 00:26:56,440
- Wait, le woke-ism?

758
00:26:56,440 --> 00:26:57,280
- Le woke-ism?

759
00:26:57,280 --> 00:26:58,120
- Le woke-ism.

760
00:26:58,120 --> 00:27:00,000
- They complain about wokeness in France?

761
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:00,840
- In France, are you kidding me?

762
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:02,320
- That's the wokest country in the world!

763
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:05,040
- No, French people hate woke-ism.

764
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:05,920
- They're skinny.

765
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:07,700
- They hate woke-ism so much,

766
00:27:07,700 --> 00:27:10,860
they wanna draw Muhammad every single day.

767
00:27:10,860 --> 00:27:13,280
- They wanna do H-T-S-J-W-Mah-min.

768
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:14,920
- They literally want to smoke,

769
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:17,400
all French people wanna do is smoke a cigarette

770
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:20,160
and then with the ashes, draw a stick figure

771
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:22,560
and say, "That is Muhammad."

772
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:24,120
That's every single day of a French person's life.

773
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:32,000
I think that Varg from Bersam, he went to jail in France for hate speech, so tell me that's

774
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,000
not woke.

775
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,000
Yeah, exactly.

776
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,000
That's the ultimate.

777
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,160
Yeah, that guy was a...

778
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:39,440
Don't tell that dude about the Aragorn shit, by the way.

779
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:40,440
That would be really bad news.

780
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:42,800
I'm sure he was the first to know.

781
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:43,800
Yeah.

782
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:44,800
Yeah.

783
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:45,800
That guy has it.

784
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:51,640
Varg has a Google alert in a mystical scrying pool for the term "Black Aragorn," and he

785
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:52,640
refreshes it every...

786
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:54,640
Swirls it around with a staff.

787
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:57,840
Let me tell you though, the screams on that next album

788
00:27:57,840 --> 00:28:00,160
are gonna be agonizing.

789
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:01,000
Do you guys think that--

790
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:02,360
'Cause he's black Aragorn.

791
00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:04,920
Do you guys think that we are like maybe the forefront

792
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:07,240
of cultural commentary at this point?

793
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:09,120
Yeah, as of this episode, as of everything we just said.

794
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:10,680
Can I do a cultural commentary?

795
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:11,500
Fuck yes.

796
00:28:11,500 --> 00:28:14,600
So it's actually rather ironic that

797
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:19,280
Russia hates SJWs as SJWs are Russia

798
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:20,840
and communism's biggest fans.

799
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:22,060
Oh fuck.

800
00:28:22,060 --> 00:28:26,220
It almost speaks to a dichotomy in the political climate.

801
00:28:26,220 --> 00:28:28,160
- Yeah.

802
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:30,620
- And the climate is changing, politically.

803
00:28:30,620 --> 00:28:33,140
- Okay, you had me until that point, Greta Thunberg.

804
00:28:33,140 --> 00:28:35,340
- Materia fucking Lee. - Shut your bitch ass up.

805
00:28:35,340 --> 00:28:38,780
- Materia fucking Lee, the climate is changing.

806
00:28:38,780 --> 00:28:41,140
Today it's 60 degrees, yesterday it was 30 degrees.

807
00:28:41,140 --> 00:28:42,300
- No, no, no, no, no.

808
00:28:42,300 --> 00:28:43,140
- What's up with that?

809
00:28:43,140 --> 00:28:43,960
- Greta Thunberg, little bug looking.

810
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:45,460
- No, no, we're canceling you.

811
00:28:45,460 --> 00:28:46,300
- Don't cancel me.

812
00:28:46,300 --> 00:28:47,140
- You're can, yep, you just got canceled by me.

813
00:28:47,140 --> 00:28:49,060
- Okay, so 'cause cancel culture is real.

814
00:28:49,060 --> 00:28:50,940
I mean, look at Louis C.K., look at...

815
00:28:50,940 --> 00:28:52,940
Who else?

816
00:28:52,940 --> 00:28:54,940
I had to do that, I had to plug the plasma ball in.

817
00:28:54,940 --> 00:28:56,940
Look at Patrick Doran, people come back for cancellation.

818
00:28:56,940 --> 00:29:04,940
True, you're right. Patrick is a perfect example of how you can do the most disgusting, immoral acts publicly.

819
00:29:04,940 --> 00:29:06,940
And people will pay you thousands of dollars a month.

820
00:29:06,940 --> 00:29:10,940
And you can still have a career. Like it's really impressive, it really is.

821
00:29:10,940 --> 00:29:14,940
Like you can ruin lives and lives and lives, like plenty of people's lives.

822
00:29:14,940 --> 00:29:16,940
Lives on lives on lives.

823
00:29:16,940 --> 00:29:17,780
- Lives on lives.

824
00:29:17,780 --> 00:29:18,620
- Yeah.

825
00:29:18,620 --> 00:29:19,440
(laughing)

826
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:21,020
- You can ruin lives on lives on lives.

827
00:29:21,020 --> 00:29:24,380
And you can be a white skinhead,

828
00:29:24,380 --> 00:29:27,340
W-H-T-E skinhead over here.

829
00:29:27,340 --> 00:29:28,500
- White skinhead?

830
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:29,460
- That's your song.

831
00:29:29,460 --> 00:29:32,960
- There's nothing Nazi about me.

832
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:34,900
- The way you just said that.

833
00:29:34,900 --> 00:29:36,220
- I did not see that coming.

834
00:29:36,220 --> 00:29:37,420
- Yeah.

835
00:29:37,420 --> 00:29:38,940
- Cultural commentary.

836
00:29:38,940 --> 00:29:40,900
- Well speaking of Nazis,

837
00:29:40,900 --> 00:29:43,820
today we're looking at psychopaths online.

838
00:29:43,820 --> 00:29:45,700
- Yeah, I'm looking at a couple psychopaths right now.

839
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:46,700
- Hey, blah.

840
00:29:46,700 --> 00:29:48,740
- I'm looking at a twisted psychopath right here.

841
00:29:48,740 --> 00:29:49,580
- Wait, really quickly, can we each do

842
00:29:49,580 --> 00:29:51,900
our best psychopath impression?

843
00:29:51,900 --> 00:29:52,900
- Yeah. - Okay.

844
00:29:52,900 --> 00:29:56,460
- I think I'm going crazy.

845
00:29:56,460 --> 00:29:58,100
- That's mine. - You go next.

846
00:29:58,100 --> 00:29:59,260
- Okay, 'cause he's gonna do something funny

847
00:29:59,260 --> 00:30:00,260
for the third one. - Yeah.

848
00:30:00,260 --> 00:30:01,860
- Okay.

849
00:30:01,860 --> 00:30:04,820
- All the better to kill you with, this my knife, my dear.

850
00:30:04,820 --> 00:30:05,860
- Okay, good.

851
00:30:05,860 --> 00:30:10,100
- Ladies and gentlemen, I'm your president,

852
00:30:10,100 --> 00:30:12,780
Barack Hussein Obama.

853
00:30:12,780 --> 00:30:14,220
- It's not even a good Obama impression.

854
00:30:14,220 --> 00:30:15,060
I did an amazing job.

855
00:30:15,060 --> 00:30:16,620
- Yeah, but if it, no, but think about it,

856
00:30:16,620 --> 00:30:20,380
because he's the bit you see my eye twister oh wait here's a good psychopath

00:30:32,740 --> 00:30:35,540
another piece of cultural commentary we can hit really quick here's another

860
00:30:35,540 --> 00:30:43,340
piece of psychopathy prevalent right now I expect a 20% plus tip bro yeah don't

861
00:30:43,340 --> 00:30:48,340
even make me think about it. And all I do is press orders on an iPad. I almost lunged at

862
00:30:48,340 --> 00:30:51,340
you because I thought that you were actually being a fucking barista turning the iPad. No,

863
00:30:51,340 --> 00:30:56,100
I would never have a tip. Yeah, you turn me that thing, the toast, it says toast on it,

864
00:30:56,100 --> 00:30:59,980
how about I come in here with a flamethrower and make you toast? You turn that iPad towards

865
00:30:59,980 --> 00:31:04,060
me, I'm hitting the home button, I'm downloading Angry Birds on that thing, and I'm making

866
00:31:04,060 --> 00:31:08,860
the line wait. I'm playing the full fucking, I'm playing the free trial. Choose your tip,

867
00:31:08,860 --> 00:31:11,260
I click custom, I'm going into the negatives.

868
00:31:11,260 --> 00:31:14,340
Now you're paying me because I look cute today.

869
00:31:14,340 --> 00:31:18,140
- Yeah, I look at the receipt, it says recommended tip.

870
00:31:18,140 --> 00:31:20,220
Yeah, I recommend you zip up your body bag

871
00:31:20,220 --> 00:31:21,420
'cause it's gonna make people throw up

872
00:31:21,420 --> 00:31:22,420
if they see what's in there.

873
00:31:22,420 --> 00:31:24,380
- The tip of my knife, the tip of my gun,

874
00:31:24,380 --> 00:31:26,340
the only tips that you'll be getting today--

875
00:31:26,340 --> 00:31:28,420
- Is none. - Is none.

876
00:31:28,420 --> 00:31:33,420
And also I'm rhyming while I'm killing you, Mr. Panera Bread.

877
00:31:33,420 --> 00:31:35,020
That's right.

878
00:31:35,020 --> 00:31:39,180
I think we should replace all people with human robots.

879
00:31:39,180 --> 00:31:41,340
- I think we should replace all people with humans.

880
00:31:41,340 --> 00:31:42,320
- Yep.

881
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:43,160
- That's right.

882
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:45,460
- Because those people, some people out there, they're NPCs.

883
00:31:45,460 --> 00:31:46,300
- But they're not humans.

884
00:31:46,300 --> 00:31:47,120
- Yeah.

885
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:48,760
- They're not humans and you can do anything you want

886
00:31:48,760 --> 00:31:49,600
to them and it doesn't matter.

887
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:50,420
- No, don't even.

888
00:31:50,420 --> 00:31:51,860
- I think every person should be a human.

889
00:31:51,860 --> 00:31:52,700
- Moral problem.

890
00:31:52,700 --> 00:31:54,140
- Don't even bring up NPC culture to me.

891
00:31:54,140 --> 00:31:54,980
- Sorry.

892
00:31:54,980 --> 00:31:55,820
- My bad.

893
00:31:55,820 --> 00:31:57,980
- Because that shit scares the fuck out of me.

894
00:31:57,980 --> 00:31:58,900
- Yeah.

895
00:31:58,900 --> 00:32:01,660
- Literally people walking around on walk cycles.

896
00:32:01,660 --> 00:32:04,380
- Yeah, here's NPC culture.

897
00:32:04,380 --> 00:32:06,900
- Hey, don't fall asleep on the furniture at Ikea.

898
00:32:06,900 --> 00:32:08,300
NPC.

899
00:32:08,300 --> 00:32:10,220
That's an NPC tells you that.

900
00:32:10,220 --> 00:32:11,500
- I say, okay, NPC.

901
00:32:11,500 --> 00:32:13,300
Fuck you, double fuck you.

902
00:32:13,300 --> 00:32:15,220
If I wanna fall asleep on the toilet at Home Depot.

903
00:32:15,220 --> 00:32:16,500
- Hey, don't use the toilet at Home Depot.

904
00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:17,340
- Yeah.

905
00:32:17,340 --> 00:32:18,180
- Yeah, what?

906
00:32:18,180 --> 00:32:20,140
- Don't use all the toilets at Home Depot like jackass.

907
00:32:20,140 --> 00:32:21,820
- Man, suck my dick, NPC.

908
00:32:21,820 --> 00:32:22,660
Pause game.

909
00:32:22,660 --> 00:32:24,100
- I'm on the Dave England level.

910
00:32:24,100 --> 00:32:25,100
- Pause game, no clip.

911
00:32:25,100 --> 00:32:26,420
Chop your head off in the Home Depot.

912
00:32:26,420 --> 00:32:27,260
Fuck you.

913
00:32:27,260 --> 00:32:28,100
- Don't draw on the wall.

914
00:32:28,100 --> 00:32:30,740
- I click the Teal Day or whatever that button is.

915
00:32:30,740 --> 00:32:31,580
Is that Teal Day?

916
00:32:31,580 --> 00:32:32,740
- Teal Day.

917
00:32:32,740 --> 00:32:34,860
the little thing in the corner. - Field day!

918
00:32:34,860 --> 00:32:36,700
- I click that little squiggly button.

919
00:32:36,700 --> 00:32:37,740
- Yeah. - I type in

920
00:32:37,740 --> 00:32:40,060
quote,

921
00:32:40,060 --> 00:32:41,140
COC,

922
00:32:41,140 --> 00:32:43,900
QA smoke.

923
00:32:43,900 --> 00:32:46,760
I go in there, I get all the Daedric armor, I come back.

924
00:32:46,760 --> 00:32:48,620
- Yeah. - And then I just start slayin'.

925
00:32:48,620 --> 00:32:50,820
- Just obliterate every single person in the Home Depot.

926
00:32:50,820 --> 00:32:51,980
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

927
00:32:51,980 --> 00:32:53,620
- It's not a bad idea.

928
00:32:53,620 --> 00:32:56,840
But we are talking about Psycho-Pass today.

929
00:32:56,840 --> 00:33:00,220
And this is, I found a little website

930
00:33:00,220 --> 00:33:02,900
- It's called the Sociopath Community.

931
00:33:02,900 --> 00:33:03,740
- Okay.

932
00:33:03,740 --> 00:33:06,300
- This is a forum for, as you can probably guess.

933
00:33:06,300 --> 00:33:10,060
- A forum for sociopathic crazies.

934
00:33:10,060 --> 00:33:11,380
- Damn!

935
00:33:11,380 --> 00:33:13,780
- Yeah, this is the one that I was trying to find

936
00:33:13,780 --> 00:33:15,060
at one point, but I couldn't.

937
00:33:15,060 --> 00:33:15,880
- Okay.

938
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:18,340
- Oh, thank you for giving me my clicker.

939
00:33:18,340 --> 00:33:19,180
- I turned it on for you.

940
00:33:19,180 --> 00:33:20,420
- So this is Sociopath Community.

941
00:33:20,420 --> 00:33:22,420
This is the first post that I found

942
00:33:22,420 --> 00:33:24,660
on the Sociopath Community forums.

943
00:33:24,660 --> 00:33:27,780
Asked a homeless woman for a blowjob.

944
00:33:27,780 --> 00:33:30,280
This is from user Allure and he says,

945
00:33:30,280 --> 00:33:31,400
"There was this homeless woman

946
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:32,980
"who was begging for small change.

947
00:33:32,980 --> 00:33:34,980
"I offered her $10 for a blow job.

948
00:33:34,980 --> 00:33:36,900
"I don't know what prices sex workers charge,

949
00:33:36,900 --> 00:33:38,220
"but it was better than nothing.

950
00:33:38,220 --> 00:33:39,720
"She wasn't in a bad shape.

951
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:42,820
"She looked like she was homeless for maybe a few days.

952
00:33:42,820 --> 00:33:44,220
"Anyway, she declined.

953
00:33:44,220 --> 00:33:46,620
"I do shit like this impulsively and it's scary.

954
00:33:46,620 --> 00:33:49,180
"I'm reminded I don't really know myself."

955
00:33:49,180 --> 00:33:50,620
- Damn. - Wow.

956
00:33:50,620 --> 00:33:51,980
- So you have to be pretty psycho

957
00:33:51,980 --> 00:33:54,100
to wanna fuck a fucking disgusting homeless woman.

958
00:33:54,100 --> 00:33:56,940
- Yeah, a disgusting few days of homelessness.

959
00:33:56,940 --> 00:33:59,100
- Is that really what this guy looks like?

960
00:33:59,100 --> 00:34:00,140
- Yep, that's a painting of him.

961
00:34:00,140 --> 00:34:01,180
- That's a painting of him?

962
00:34:01,180 --> 00:34:02,620
- Yeah, he has a bunch of different posts

963
00:34:02,620 --> 00:34:04,740
where he talks about, he has one where he ranks

964
00:34:04,740 --> 00:34:09,740
his favorite philosophers, and he gave Sun Tzu his S tier,

965
00:34:09,740 --> 00:34:14,100
and he gave Benjamin Franklin F.

966
00:34:14,100 --> 00:34:17,900
- Well yeah, S for Sun Tzu and then F for Franklin.

967
00:34:17,900 --> 00:34:19,540
- You're a fucking genius.

968
00:34:19,540 --> 00:34:23,460
- When I was reading about posts from psychopaths

969
00:34:23,460 --> 00:34:26,300
and sociopaths online and stuff, it is funny that,

970
00:34:26,300 --> 00:34:27,780
I feel like some of them you read and you're like,

971
00:34:27,780 --> 00:34:29,620
"Oh my God, this person needs some help.

972
00:34:29,620 --> 00:34:30,620
Something's going on here."

973
00:34:30,620 --> 00:34:32,020
And that's a lot of them you read and it's like,

974
00:34:32,020 --> 00:34:33,720
this is somebody who like,

975
00:34:33,720 --> 00:34:36,440
they saw the matrix code by like reading,

976
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:38,900
like watching Fight Club and they got something out of it

977
00:34:38,900 --> 00:34:40,980
that nobody else in the world got out of it.

978
00:34:40,980 --> 00:34:43,980
And it changed the way they lived their life forever.

979
00:34:43,980 --> 00:34:44,820
- Yeah.

980
00:34:44,820 --> 00:34:45,660
- Yeah, I feel like they like,

981
00:34:45,660 --> 00:34:48,660
somehow they read philosophy and they don't become

982
00:34:48,660 --> 00:34:53,900
like a lit guy who's like a book nerd.

983
00:34:53,900 --> 00:34:56,140
They somehow an evil person.

984
00:34:56,140 --> 00:34:57,980
- Speaking of lit, guys. - Pretty smart.

985
00:34:57,980 --> 00:34:59,300
- Yep, us three. - Damn.

986
00:34:59,300 --> 00:35:01,260
- Us three, what's up?

987
00:35:01,260 --> 00:35:03,340
- What's next over here? - We took some fucking K2

988
00:35:03,340 --> 00:35:05,660
before we recorded. - You wish.

989
00:35:05,660 --> 00:35:07,100
Slowly turning into an animal.

990
00:35:07,100 --> 00:35:08,980
(laughing)

991
00:35:08,980 --> 00:35:12,460
So this is a better title than it is a actual thing.

992
00:35:12,460 --> 00:35:14,460
This says, if you could turn into any animal at will,

993
00:35:14,460 --> 00:35:17,060
but in doing so, every time it got harder to turn back

994
00:35:17,060 --> 00:35:19,980
until you started developing hybrid features and senses,

995
00:35:19,980 --> 00:35:21,100
which animal would you choose?

996
00:35:21,100 --> 00:35:22,800
Of course, you could just seldom use,

997
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:25,340
if and maybe only become a bit hairier, et cetera,

998
00:35:25,340 --> 00:35:26,540
by the end of your life.

999
00:35:26,540 --> 00:35:28,340
- I don't wanna be hairier by the end of my life.

1000
00:35:28,340 --> 00:35:29,180
- Fuck no!

1001
00:35:29,180 --> 00:35:30,740
- I got enough hair, I mean you guys have seen me

1002
00:35:30,740 --> 00:35:31,580
at the pool.

1003
00:35:31,580 --> 00:35:34,640
- You need to become, you need to turn into a dolphin.

1004
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:35,480
- Yeah.

1005
00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:37,460
- Dolphins have hair, don't they?

1006
00:35:37,460 --> 00:35:38,300
- Dolphins don't have hair.

1007
00:35:38,300 --> 00:35:39,340
- They're mammals, I thought.

1008
00:35:39,340 --> 00:35:40,180
- Man, don't mammals have hair?

1009
00:35:40,180 --> 00:35:41,000
- Shut up.

1010
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:41,940
- They have alopecia.

1011
00:35:41,940 --> 00:35:43,500
- They have very little hair.

1012
00:35:43,500 --> 00:35:45,100
- Why not say like a snake?

1013
00:35:45,100 --> 00:35:46,540
- Basically it's like a sphinx cat.

1014
00:35:46,540 --> 00:35:47,860
- Like something with no hair.

1015
00:35:47,860 --> 00:35:48,700
- It's like a sphinx cat when you touch a dolphin.

1016
00:35:48,700 --> 00:35:50,820
- But a dolphin is a good thing to be also.

1017
00:35:50,820 --> 00:35:52,380
- Feels like yo nuts.

1018
00:35:52,380 --> 00:35:53,220
- What?

1019
00:35:53,220 --> 00:35:56,220
a dolphin it feels exactly like the human nutsack.

1020
00:35:56,220 --> 00:35:58,100
- That's not true. - I'm not sure that's true at all.

1021
00:35:58,100 --> 00:35:58,940
- You've never been to sea world.

1022
00:35:58,940 --> 00:36:00,660
- It's tight, I know it feels like a pussay.

1023
00:36:00,660 --> 00:36:01,500
- Yeah, I think it feels like a blowhole.

1024
00:36:01,500 --> 00:36:02,320
- No, that's the blowhole.

1025
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:03,160
- A man about my size.

1026
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:04,660
- No, the whole skin. - The blowhole feels like

1027
00:36:04,660 --> 00:36:05,740
a pussay. - No, the whole skin.

1028
00:36:05,740 --> 00:36:06,580
No, no, no, no, no.

1029
00:36:06,580 --> 00:36:08,140
- But the skin feels like nuts.

1030
00:36:08,140 --> 00:36:10,260
(laughing)

1031
00:36:10,260 --> 00:36:11,580
Skin feel like nuts, blowhole feel like pussay.

1032
00:36:11,580 --> 00:36:12,420
- You're lying.

1033
00:36:12,420 --> 00:36:14,460
- You're lying. - You're lying.

1034
00:36:14,460 --> 00:36:15,300
You've never touched a dolphin in your life.

1035
00:36:15,300 --> 00:36:16,700
- I've touched a dolphin.

1036
00:36:16,700 --> 00:36:17,540
- You've never touched a dolphin.

1037
00:36:17,540 --> 00:36:20,820
- Yeah, Dolphin Emulator played Herb's Moon.

1038
00:36:20,820 --> 00:36:23,780
- You touch a doll's fin, yeah, her finny.

1039
00:36:23,780 --> 00:36:25,660
- No. - You touch a doll's finny.

1040
00:36:25,660 --> 00:36:27,820
- Touched a doll's finny.

1041
00:36:27,820 --> 00:36:29,220
- You did, didn't you? - No, I didn't.

1042
00:36:29,220 --> 00:36:31,620
- You went up to the doll and touched the finny.

1043
00:36:31,620 --> 00:36:34,900
You pedophile. - I did not touch

1044
00:36:34,900 --> 00:36:36,300
a doll's finny. - You're an arse

1045
00:36:36,300 --> 00:36:38,140
and you touched a doll's finny. - I did not touch

1046
00:36:38,140 --> 00:36:40,260
a doll's finny. - You are.

1047
00:36:40,260 --> 00:36:42,020
- No. - You touched a doll's finny.

1048
00:36:42,020 --> 00:36:43,620
- Did not touch it. - You did.

1049
00:36:43,620 --> 00:36:45,820
- You've completely lost the plot.

1050
00:36:45,820 --> 00:36:46,860
- Mate. - You're mental.

1051
00:36:46,860 --> 00:36:49,660
It's funnier when we just don't do the accent and say that.

1052
00:36:49,660 --> 00:36:50,980
Mate, you've lost the plot.

1053
00:36:50,980 --> 00:36:52,260
You've lost the plot, mate.

1054
00:36:52,260 --> 00:36:52,760
You're daft.

1055
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:53,760
You're completely daft.

1056
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:54,760
Are you taking the piss?

1057
00:36:54,760 --> 00:36:55,660
This whole weekend--

1058
00:36:55,660 --> 00:36:56,580
Oh, what the blood?

1059
00:36:56,580 --> 00:36:59,300
[LAUGHTER]

1060
00:36:59,300 --> 00:37:02,380
This whole weekend, I kept-- every time I texted you guys,

1061
00:37:02,380 --> 00:37:04,060
I started it with mates.

1062
00:37:04,060 --> 00:37:04,580
Yeah.

1063
00:37:04,580 --> 00:37:05,080
Mates.

1064
00:37:05,080 --> 00:37:06,580
Because it's St. Paddy's Day, guys.

1065
00:37:06,580 --> 00:37:07,080
Legends.

1066
00:37:07,080 --> 00:37:08,540
I was on a complete different tiff.

1067
00:37:08,540 --> 00:37:11,100
It's so fun to text your girlfriend and say,

1068
00:37:11,100 --> 00:37:12,100
I'll be home later.

1069
00:37:12,100 --> 00:37:13,620
I'm out having a pint with the lads.

1070
00:37:13,620 --> 00:37:16,060
I just text, pigs have your bunda.

1071
00:37:16,060 --> 00:37:17,060
And then a question mark.

1072
00:37:17,060 --> 00:37:18,060
Yeah.

1073
00:37:18,060 --> 00:37:19,060
Pics of your poonda?

1074
00:37:19,060 --> 00:37:20,060
Poonda?

1075
00:37:20,060 --> 00:37:21,060
Isn't that what they say?

1076
00:37:21,060 --> 00:37:22,060
I don't know.

1077
00:37:22,060 --> 00:37:23,060
That bird has a nice poonda!

1078
00:37:23,060 --> 00:37:24,060
You never heard that?

1079
00:37:24,060 --> 00:37:25,060
No.

1080
00:37:25,060 --> 00:37:28,020
Couple of birds, couple of 8.5s with nice poondas.

1081
00:37:28,020 --> 00:37:33,860
You never seen that video of that guy where he's like, "Manchester, top scratch, horrid

1082
00:37:33,860 --> 00:37:38,380
flans and a poonda, the tens have got poondas."

1083
00:37:38,380 --> 00:37:39,380
You never seen that guy?

1084
00:37:39,380 --> 00:37:40,380
No.

1085
00:37:40,380 --> 00:37:44,260
He's this British guy who talks about every city in the UK.

1086
00:37:44,260 --> 00:37:45,260
London, England.

1087
00:37:45,260 --> 00:37:47,860
and he talks about what the nightclub is like.

1088
00:37:47,860 --> 00:37:48,700
- Yeah.

1089
00:37:48,700 --> 00:37:50,860
- He's like, "Tulpscrum, tons of poonder."

1090
00:37:50,860 --> 00:37:51,900
- Scran or scram?

1091
00:37:51,900 --> 00:37:52,860
- Scran.

1092
00:37:52,860 --> 00:37:54,340
- Scran like food, right? - That's food, yeah.

1093
00:37:54,340 --> 00:37:56,420
Yeah, so it'll be a picture of the most disgusting

1094
00:37:56,420 --> 00:37:57,420
French fries you've ever seen.

1095
00:37:57,420 --> 00:38:00,540
He's like, "Tulpscrum," and then a woman with a big ass,

1096
00:38:00,540 --> 00:38:02,380
"Giant poonders."

1097
00:38:02,380 --> 00:38:03,220
- Poonder?

1098
00:38:03,220 --> 00:38:04,700
- "Fatty poonders."

1099
00:38:04,700 --> 00:38:06,620
- I think that's the right word.

1100
00:38:06,620 --> 00:38:07,460
- I don't know.

1101
00:38:07,460 --> 00:38:08,300
- Fat poonders.

1102
00:38:08,300 --> 00:38:09,140
- Okay, I don't--

1103
00:38:09,140 --> 00:38:09,980
- Tons of scrum.

1104
00:38:09,980 --> 00:38:12,060
- I don't wanna hear it anymore.

1105
00:38:12,060 --> 00:38:12,900
- And a cobblestone wrench.

1106
00:38:12,900 --> 00:38:14,420
- I feel like I'm going crazy.

1107
00:38:14,420 --> 00:38:15,640
- And I go, whoa.

1108
00:38:15,640 --> 00:38:17,140
- A cobblestone wrench?

1109
00:38:17,140 --> 00:38:18,340
- He says nonsense shit.

1110
00:38:18,340 --> 00:38:19,180
- Oh, okay.

1111
00:38:19,180 --> 00:38:20,300
- Yeah.

1112
00:38:20,300 --> 00:38:23,020
- And there's a gobbler, a one-eyed,

1113
00:38:23,020 --> 00:38:24,220
flying purple people eater,

1114
00:38:24,220 --> 00:38:27,100
right there in the downtown Manchester.

1115
00:38:27,100 --> 00:38:28,980
I go, okay, I think I will go there.

1116
00:38:28,980 --> 00:38:31,160
Slowly turning into an animal,

1117
00:38:31,160 --> 00:38:32,300
this guy asks which animal.

1118
00:38:32,300 --> 00:38:34,340
This person says, an owl,

1119
00:38:34,340 --> 00:38:36,740
and their profile photo is of an owl.

1120
00:38:36,740 --> 00:38:38,980
(laughing)

1121
00:38:38,980 --> 00:38:44,180
This person is a dangerous psychopath,

1122
00:38:44,180 --> 00:38:46,220
that they need to be in jail.

1123
00:38:46,220 --> 00:38:47,140
- Yeah, look at their eyes.

1124
00:38:47,140 --> 00:38:48,740
- Look at, they're crazy.

1125
00:38:48,740 --> 00:38:49,980
- They have crazy eyes.

1126
00:38:49,980 --> 00:38:51,100
- Yeah, what, you wanna be an owl

1127
00:38:51,100 --> 00:38:52,620
so you can turn your head all the way around

1128
00:38:52,620 --> 00:38:53,540
to scare your victim?

1129
00:38:53,540 --> 00:38:55,260
Yeah, fuck you.

1130
00:38:55,260 --> 00:38:56,260
Am I a sociopath?

1131
00:38:56,260 --> 00:38:57,860
I feel empty and angry all the time.

1132
00:38:57,860 --> 00:39:00,400
I work in a head shop and sell minors drugs all the time

1133
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:01,640
and even steal from the register.

1134
00:39:01,640 --> 00:39:03,740
I don't care about anyone or anything.

1135
00:39:03,740 --> 00:39:05,180
I just thought that one was badass.

1136
00:39:05,180 --> 00:39:07,580
That's from ADNGR.

1137
00:39:07,580 --> 00:39:08,420
- Dopeness.

1138
00:39:08,420 --> 00:39:09,240
- A-danger.

1139
00:39:09,240 --> 00:39:10,080
- ADNGR.

1140
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:11,100
- Oh my God, they're a danger.

1141
00:39:11,100 --> 00:39:11,940
- Now get this.

1142
00:39:11,940 --> 00:39:16,940
- This is a forum post called Dark Memes.

1143
00:39:16,940 --> 00:39:19,420
- I don't, just skip this part.

1144
00:39:19,420 --> 00:39:20,980
- Okay, no, I'm not gonna skip it.

1145
00:39:20,980 --> 00:39:24,140
If you like dark memes, I want you to go ahead

1146
00:39:24,140 --> 00:39:26,980
and turn on your screen and watch this dark meme,

1147
00:39:26,980 --> 00:39:28,220
'cause look at this.

1148
00:39:28,220 --> 00:39:33,220
This is, if her soap looks like this, you're getting laid.

1149
00:39:33,220 --> 00:39:35,500
And it's a bar of soap with a bunch of disgusting

1150
00:39:35,500 --> 00:39:36,980
little puby worms all over it.

1151
00:39:36,980 --> 00:39:38,180
- Ew. - Yeah.

1152
00:39:38,180 --> 00:39:40,220
- And another-- - That was posted by a bat.

1153
00:39:40,220 --> 00:39:42,680
Yeah, another animal profile photo.

1154
00:39:42,680 --> 00:39:44,480
Anyone else think that looked like SpongeBob?

1155
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:45,080
Yeah.

1156
00:39:45,080 --> 00:39:46,700
If my soap looks like that, I'm getting laid.

1157
00:39:46,700 --> 00:39:48,080
Yeah, I'm sticking the soap up my butt.

1158
00:39:48,080 --> 00:39:48,560
Yeah.

1159
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:49,640
Dark memes.

1160
00:39:49,640 --> 00:39:50,520
Damn.

1161
00:39:50,520 --> 00:39:52,840
Yeah, and I'm killing my whole family with the soap.

1162
00:39:52,840 --> 00:39:54,040
That would be a darker twist.

1163
00:39:54,040 --> 00:39:55,280
I'm going to hell for this one.

1164
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:57,120
Yeah, let's do like--

1165
00:39:57,120 --> 00:39:58,400
let's make these even darker.

1166
00:39:58,400 --> 00:39:59,640
I think we can punch those up.

1167
00:39:59,640 --> 00:40:01,040
I think we just make them darker.

1168
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:02,600
But with the soap-- yeah.

1169
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:04,160
If her soap looks like this--

1170
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:06,720
If her soap looks like this, I'm slitting the soap's throat.

1171
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:08,720
If her soap looks like this, she's

1172
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:09,960
going to look like this, too.

1173
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:12,060
Yeah, if her soap looks like this,

1174
00:40:12,060 --> 00:40:15,260
if her soap looks like this, you do a hundred abortions.

1175
00:40:15,260 --> 00:40:19,000
That's like dark humor, I think.

1176
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:19,900
Yeah, they do.

1177
00:40:19,900 --> 00:40:22,520
That is something I'm noticing in psychopath

1178
00:40:22,520 --> 00:40:24,600
and sociopath communities when I was browsing.

1179
00:40:24,600 --> 00:40:26,940
They do not have any boundaries at all

1180
00:40:26,940 --> 00:40:28,920
when it comes to discussing abortion.

1181
00:40:28,920 --> 00:40:30,640
They love dark humor and abortion.

1182
00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:32,280
They say, every single post, they say,

1183
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:33,600
I, yeah, I'm a sociopath.

1184
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:35,680
I wouldn't care if a lady got a hundred abortions.

1185
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:36,520
Well, that's the thing.

1186
00:40:36,520 --> 00:40:39,560
You, 4% of people, one to 4% of people are sociopaths.

1187
00:40:39,560 --> 00:40:42,760
Guess what percentage of people are also abortionist doctors?

1188
00:40:42,760 --> 00:40:44,880
- Fuck, probably 4%, right?

1189
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:49,720
- I think 50 to 60% after 2009, but yeah, pretty scary.

1190
00:40:49,720 --> 00:40:51,620
But some of them are sociopaths.

1191
00:40:51,620 --> 00:40:54,300
- Well, based on those numbers, it would be all of them,

1192
00:40:54,300 --> 00:40:56,940
'cause 4% is only a part of 50%.

1193
00:40:56,940 --> 00:40:59,240
- But some of the guys are sociopaths.

1194
00:40:59,240 --> 00:41:01,920
All of the sociopaths are, you're misunderstanding,

1195
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:05,400
all of the sociopaths are definitely abortionist MD doctors,

1196
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:08,560
but only some of the doctors are abortionists.

1197
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:10,200
- I know about a sociopath.

1198
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:12,760
There's a sociopath doctor on TV.

1199
00:41:12,760 --> 00:41:14,520
- What's his name?

1200
00:41:14,520 --> 00:41:16,400
- Dr. House, yeah, he doesn't feel much.

1201
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:19,160
- Yeah, he basically hates human emotion.

1202
00:41:19,160 --> 00:41:20,280
- Did he ever do an abortion?

1203
00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:21,100
- No.

1204
00:41:21,100 --> 00:41:21,940
- I never watched a single piece of that show.

1205
00:41:21,940 --> 00:41:23,660
- Well, you need an abortion.

1206
00:41:23,660 --> 00:41:24,500
- You never seen a piece of it?

1207
00:41:24,500 --> 00:41:25,800
- No, I've never even seen it.

1208
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:27,860
- Didn't they make Cal Penn kill himself?

1209
00:41:27,860 --> 00:41:28,700
- I don't remember.

1210
00:41:28,700 --> 00:41:29,520
- Yeah.

1211
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:30,360
- Everybody kills themselves and fucks each other.

1212
00:41:30,360 --> 00:41:31,760
- They make Cal Penn kill himself

1213
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:34,000
and then he comes back like two seasons later

1214
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:35,640
'cause he was done being Obama's intern.

1215
00:41:35,640 --> 00:41:38,360
- Olivia Munn has ALS in that movie, or in that show.

1216
00:41:38,360 --> 00:41:39,440
- Wow, yeah.

1217
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:40,280
And Lou Gehrig's disease.

1218
00:41:40,280 --> 00:41:42,400
- That's what's so awful, it's like the worst thing ever

1219
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:44,120
'cause it's the most beautiful woman.

1220
00:41:44,120 --> 00:41:47,000
And to think of her slowly turning into a cube

1221
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:48,480
or whatever is so scary.

1222
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:51,960
- When I was in third grade, I did a project on Lou Gehrig,

1223
00:41:51,960 --> 00:41:52,840
like a book report.

1224
00:41:52,840 --> 00:41:53,680
- The man?

1225
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:56,200
- And yeah, and then I learned about his disease

1226
00:41:56,200 --> 00:41:57,040
and everything. - My man.

1227
00:41:57,040 --> 00:41:58,680
- I learned about the disease and everything.

1228
00:41:58,680 --> 00:42:02,000
And then like a friend of a, my mom's friend,

1229
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:03,720
like died in their sleep.

1230
00:42:03,720 --> 00:42:04,640
And my mom was just like,

1231
00:42:04,640 --> 00:42:06,400
"Yeah, I just don't know how that could happen."

1232
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:09,320
And I turned to my mom and I was like, could be ALS.

1233
00:42:09,320 --> 00:42:10,160
- Wow.

1234
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:11,200
- Could be Lou Gehrig's disease.

1235
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:13,200
- You diagnosed her right there.

1236
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:17,040
- She could have died of Lou Gehrig's disease in her sleep.

1237
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:18,920
- Okay, what's next?

1238
00:42:18,920 --> 00:42:21,400
You are gay, and then they posted the

1239
00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:24,080
why are you gay funniest African interview,

1240
00:42:24,080 --> 00:42:25,200
and then they responded, said,

1241
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:27,560
"I'd honestly like my own post here if I could.

1242
00:42:27,560 --> 00:42:29,480
This vid is brilliant."

1243
00:42:29,480 --> 00:42:31,640
- Okay.

1244
00:42:31,640 --> 00:42:34,800
- Yeah, so this guy's definitely sociopathic vibes.

1245
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:36,280
- You would have to be a sociopath

1246
00:42:36,280 --> 00:42:38,280
to like your own post though.

1247
00:42:38,280 --> 00:42:39,120
- 100%.

1248
00:42:39,120 --> 00:42:40,440
- That's a clear sign.

1249
00:42:40,440 --> 00:42:41,280
- Absolutely. - No doubt.

1250
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:42,320
- Yeah.

1251
00:42:42,320 --> 00:42:44,120
- Don't even care for social norms.

1252
00:42:44,120 --> 00:42:47,920
- He's breaking the rules of the internet,

1253
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:49,520
user 222212.

1254
00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:50,480
- A shadow not so far.

1255
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:52,500
- Spider bursts out of a banana.

1256
00:42:52,500 --> 00:42:55,080
This is the kind of sick shit that these sociopaths

1257
00:42:55,080 --> 00:42:56,960
think is funny or interesting.

1258
00:42:56,960 --> 00:42:58,360
A spider bursts out of a banana.

1259
00:42:58,360 --> 00:43:01,160
Tell you what that's not, to me, is a good time

1260
00:43:01,160 --> 00:43:04,040
or something worth talking about or looking at.

1261
00:43:04,040 --> 00:43:06,360
If you share that video to another person,

1262
00:43:06,360 --> 00:43:07,880
you are literally a sadist.

1263
00:43:07,880 --> 00:43:09,520
You're scum!

1264
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:11,320
Okay, what's next?

1265
00:43:11,320 --> 00:43:12,320
Where is Hillary?

1266
00:43:12,320 --> 00:43:13,160
Oh my God.

1267
00:43:13,160 --> 00:43:15,520
And this is by Donald Trump in 2019.

1268
00:43:15,520 --> 00:43:18,480
Hello folks, has anybody seen Crooked Hillary around?

1269
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:20,320
I've received word that she comes here.

1270
00:43:20,320 --> 00:43:21,880
Not much of a surprise, I'd say.

1271
00:43:21,880 --> 00:43:23,540
She always was a loser.

1272
00:43:23,540 --> 00:43:24,960
Let me know if you've seen her.

1273
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:25,960
That was Donald Trump.

1274
00:43:25,960 --> 00:43:26,800
Wow.

1275
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:27,620
And he's looking for Hillary.

1276
00:43:27,620 --> 00:43:28,460
And he's on the phone?

1277
00:43:28,460 --> 00:43:30,200
He's on the sociopathic community forum

1278
00:43:30,200 --> 00:43:31,280
because he's trying to put,

1279
00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:33,640
Hillary's trying to lock her up and put her in jail.

1280
00:43:33,640 --> 00:43:36,560
and he's like, where would a sociopath like Hillary hang out?

1281
00:43:36,560 --> 00:43:37,400
Probably the sociopath.

1282
00:43:37,400 --> 00:43:38,240
- The sociopath.

1283
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:40,120
- And the person who made this thought of the joke

1284
00:43:40,120 --> 00:43:42,840
in November 19th, 2019.

1285
00:43:42,840 --> 00:43:43,680
- It took a while.

1286
00:43:43,680 --> 00:43:45,240
- It only took them three years.

1287
00:43:45,240 --> 00:43:46,080
- It took a while, but--

1288
00:43:46,080 --> 00:43:47,240
- To think of doing this.

1289
00:43:47,240 --> 00:43:51,040
- There is one response to this post

1290
00:43:51,040 --> 00:43:52,200
that I think is pretty good,

1291
00:43:52,200 --> 00:43:53,840
and this is from Big Chungus,

1292
00:43:53,840 --> 00:43:57,160
and he says, "She's under my desk, sucking my chuncus."

1293
00:43:57,160 --> 00:43:59,040
(laughing)

1294
00:43:59,040 --> 00:43:59,880
And this guy--

1295
00:43:59,880 --> 00:44:01,320
- Talk about a sociopath, my God.

1296
00:44:01,320 --> 00:44:02,560
- This guy has a pretty good

1297
00:44:02,560 --> 00:44:03,800
- 38 posts. - Posting history.

1298
00:44:03,800 --> 00:44:05,400
Yeah, and I took a look at those.

1299
00:44:05,400 --> 00:44:07,160
Chungus Chungus, major major,

1300
00:44:07,160 --> 00:44:10,360
how big is your Chungus, and me, by Big Chungus.

1301
00:44:10,360 --> 00:44:15,360
So, Big Chungus is a sociopath.

1302
00:44:15,360 --> 00:44:16,200
- Wow.

1303
00:44:16,200 --> 00:44:17,480
- Okay, that's the end of all mine.

1304
00:44:17,480 --> 00:44:20,120
- All right, here's what I found.

1305
00:44:20,120 --> 00:44:22,820
I wanna preface everything before this.

1306
00:44:22,820 --> 00:44:25,120
I just wanna say that, I mean, you guys remember

1307
00:44:25,120 --> 00:44:29,000
back in like July 2020, I was diagnosed with psychosis.

1308
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:30,960
- Psychosis?

1309
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:32,960
I was going through about a psychosis.

1310
00:44:32,960 --> 00:44:33,960
I don't really remember that.

1311
00:44:33,960 --> 00:44:34,960
I'm not sure I remember that either.

1312
00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:35,960
Juby if you want to click over to my...

1313
00:44:35,960 --> 00:44:36,960
Psychosis or psychopathy?

1314
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:38,960
Click over to my thing, my slide.

1315
00:44:38,960 --> 00:44:40,960
Wait, psychosis is a different thing.

1316
00:44:40,960 --> 00:44:41,960
Do you realize that...

1317
00:44:41,960 --> 00:44:42,960
I was diagnosed with psychopathy.

1318
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:43,960
Okay.

1319
00:44:43,960 --> 00:44:44,960
So why did you say psychosis?

1320
00:44:44,960 --> 00:44:45,960
Psychosis is something different.

1321
00:44:45,960 --> 00:44:46,960
Well...

1322
00:44:46,960 --> 00:44:47,960
Psychosis is like...

1323
00:44:47,960 --> 00:44:48,960
There's a very public meltdown...

1324
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:51,960
Psychosis is like the elephants on parade scene.

1325
00:44:51,960 --> 00:44:52,960
Yeah.

1326
00:44:52,960 --> 00:44:55,960
There's a very public meltdown that I had and someone filmed it and I'm just gonna...

1327
00:44:55,960 --> 00:44:56,960
You know what?

1328
00:44:56,960 --> 00:44:57,960
I'm gonna come...

1329
00:44:57,960 --> 00:44:59,960
There's a thing about mental health.

1330
00:44:59,960 --> 00:45:01,960
I'm just gonna come forward with it.

1331
00:45:01,960 --> 00:45:03,960
I'm just gonna show you.

1332
00:45:03,960 --> 00:45:05,960
Okay, Ted Lasso.

1333
00:45:05,960 --> 00:45:09,960
If that played automatically,

1334
00:45:09,960 --> 00:45:11,960
this would have been a lot funnier.

1335
00:45:11,960 --> 00:45:15,960
Guys, that's what the audio listen is.

1336
00:45:15,960 --> 00:45:17,960
It's the Tasmanian Devil.

1337
00:45:17,960 --> 00:45:21,960
It's a video cartoon network,

1338
00:45:21,960 --> 00:45:23,960
the Tasmanian Devil.

1339
00:45:23,960 --> 00:45:27,960
I thought it was gonna be in slideshow mode

1340
00:45:27,960 --> 00:45:29,620
in slideshow mode and it would have played automatically.

1341
00:45:29,620 --> 00:45:31,360
- Yo, those noises be when I'm eating that.

1342
00:45:31,360 --> 00:45:33,460
(imitates eating noises)

1343
00:45:33,460 --> 00:45:34,300
- You going (imitates eating noises)

1344
00:45:34,300 --> 00:45:37,520
- All right, but I needed to find, I was--

1345
00:45:37,520 --> 00:45:38,620
- 'Cause it's so gross.

1346
00:45:38,620 --> 00:45:40,120
(imitates eating noises)

1347
00:45:40,120 --> 00:45:41,680
- 'Cause I'm throwing up every single time.

1348
00:45:41,680 --> 00:45:44,740
But I was looking through, this is a forum I found.

1349
00:45:44,740 --> 00:45:49,960
It's not the Psychopaths Forum or the Sociopath Forum

1350
00:45:49,960 --> 00:45:50,800
or anything like that.

1351
00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:51,640
- But it's close, yeah.

1352
00:45:51,640 --> 00:45:56,080
- It's close, it's xnxx.com, or forum.xnxx.com.

1353
00:45:56,080 --> 00:45:56,920
- Damn.

1354
00:45:56,920 --> 00:46:00,700
post that says, "Daddy, what is a psycho nut job?"

1355
00:46:00,700 --> 00:46:01,540
- You can never--

1356
00:46:01,540 --> 00:46:04,780
- "Honey, there is a person here at XNXX

1357
00:46:04,780 --> 00:46:06,620
that does not like us.

1358
00:46:06,620 --> 00:46:11,620
Here is an example of the post that he made to our thread.

1359
00:46:11,620 --> 00:46:15,160
Every post we make, the same person responds

1360
00:46:15,160 --> 00:46:18,980
with the message, 'Daddy, why'"

1361
00:46:18,980 --> 00:46:19,820
Fuck, I get to just put it--

1362
00:46:19,820 --> 00:46:22,340
- "Daddy, why don't the moderators do anything about it?

1363
00:46:22,340 --> 00:46:24,380
Flaming is why the forum is so popular.

1364
00:46:24,380 --> 00:46:25,940
Daddy, what is flaming?

1365
00:46:25,940 --> 00:46:27,660
Honey, use the search function.

1366
00:46:27,660 --> 00:46:30,060
I don't know why you don't zoom in before you take the screenshot.

1367
00:46:30,060 --> 00:46:33,780
I always think that I'm going to be able to read it,

1368
00:46:33,780 --> 00:46:36,180
but then I never can.

1369
00:46:36,180 --> 00:46:37,620
You need to start bringing your glasses.

1370
00:46:37,620 --> 00:46:39,940
Yeah, I need to start bringing my glasses.

1371
00:46:39,940 --> 00:46:42,220
Or just zoom in.

1372
00:46:42,220 --> 00:46:45,340
This is in response to this, where they're

1373
00:46:45,340 --> 00:46:48,100
trying to role play together, and this guy just responds,

1374
00:46:48,100 --> 00:46:50,580
psycho nut job, psycho nut job.

1375
00:46:50,580 --> 00:46:52,980
And it's basically the whole thread

1376
00:46:52,980 --> 00:46:57,300
gets flamed with psycho nut job all the way down.

1377
00:46:57,300 --> 00:46:58,940
- Is this a sexual position?

1378
00:46:58,940 --> 00:47:00,140
Or is he calling them a psycho nut job?

1379
00:47:00,140 --> 00:47:01,460
- He's calling them psycho nut jobs.

1380
00:47:01,460 --> 00:47:02,300
- I would enjoy it.

1381
00:47:02,300 --> 00:47:03,820
- I was thinking like, yeah, I want a psycho nut job.

1382
00:47:03,820 --> 00:47:04,660
- Yeah, I'd be down with that.

1383
00:47:04,660 --> 00:47:06,100
- Psycho make me nut.

1384
00:47:06,100 --> 00:47:08,300
- But imagine being on the XNXX forums

1385
00:47:08,300 --> 00:47:12,300
and being like, man, you fucking role players are psychopaths.

1386
00:47:12,300 --> 00:47:13,120
- That's fine.

1387
00:47:13,120 --> 00:47:15,460
- I logged into XNXX.com.

1388
00:47:15,460 --> 00:47:19,380
- If I was a Christian, more of a Christian, sorry.

1389
00:47:19,380 --> 00:47:20,900
If I was more of a Christian,

1390
00:47:20,900 --> 00:47:25,900
And then I would be leading a team of underage people

1391
00:47:25,900 --> 00:47:28,380
who go on and they press the I'm over 18

1392
00:47:28,380 --> 00:47:29,760
and then go on the forums and say,

1393
00:47:29,760 --> 00:47:32,740
actually I was 16 this entire time.

1394
00:47:32,740 --> 00:47:36,660
And the Xanax forum and then get it completely destroyed.

1395
00:47:36,660 --> 00:47:37,620
- Well here's the next thing,

1396
00:47:37,620 --> 00:47:39,300
this is somebody coming to their aid.

1397
00:47:39,300 --> 00:47:42,180
Leroy Brown, who's also a role player, says,

1398
00:47:42,180 --> 00:47:43,860
yo Joey-- - I've heard some bad things

1399
00:47:43,860 --> 00:47:45,180
about Leroy Brown. - Me too.

1400
00:47:45,180 --> 00:47:48,580
- I've heard he's the baddest guy in the city.

1401
00:47:48,580 --> 00:47:49,860
- The whole damn town. - Old Jim Walker

1402
00:47:49,860 --> 00:47:51,380
tried to play him in pool.

1403
00:47:51,380 --> 00:47:53,380
- God damn, I can't believe he's posting on here.

1404
00:47:53,380 --> 00:47:54,780
- But he said, "Yo, Joliet,

1405
00:47:54,780 --> 00:47:57,260
"need some help teaching dat dude a lesson?

1406
00:47:57,260 --> 00:47:59,140
"I don't personally get my hands dirty,

1407
00:47:59,140 --> 00:48:01,840
"but I got some friends close to Joliet."

1408
00:48:01,840 --> 00:48:03,820
And they said, "Go away, troll, go away, troll,"

1409
00:48:03,820 --> 00:48:06,280
and then flamed the fucking post like that.

1410
00:48:06,280 --> 00:48:09,380
- They totally flamed him. - They flamed the post

1411
00:48:09,380 --> 00:48:10,980
like that. (laughing)

1412
00:48:10,980 --> 00:48:13,180
Psycho Nutjob is someone with nothing else

1413
00:48:13,180 --> 00:48:15,420
of value to contribute, so he stupidly repeats

1414
00:48:15,420 --> 00:48:18,340
the same meaningless words like psycho nutjob,

1415
00:48:18,340 --> 00:48:21,440
And then there's another Joliet script here.

1416
00:48:21,440 --> 00:48:23,580
Daddy, why did you kill yourself?

1417
00:48:23,580 --> 00:48:24,980
Honey, I committed suicide

1418
00:48:24,980 --> 00:48:27,180
because I felt I was no longer wanted.

1419
00:48:27,180 --> 00:48:28,060
How could you do that?

1420
00:48:28,060 --> 00:48:28,900
I love you.

1421
00:48:28,900 --> 00:48:30,360
I love you too, honey, goodbye.

1422
00:48:30,360 --> 00:48:33,260
Daddy, does that mean we are not going to Pizza Hut tonight?

1423
00:48:33,260 --> 00:48:34,420
Maybe tomorrow.

1424
00:48:34,420 --> 00:48:35,420
Bitch, you dead.

1425
00:48:35,420 --> 00:48:38,440
- I would say that you did actually do

1426
00:48:38,440 --> 00:48:40,660
more of a kind of psychosis-themed one,

1427
00:48:40,660 --> 00:48:42,820
because none of this is making any sense to me.

1428
00:48:42,820 --> 00:48:44,720
- Yeah, I don't really understand.

1429
00:48:44,720 --> 00:48:46,940
What is--

1430
00:48:46,940 --> 00:48:49,440
Don't you think your spamming game is stale?

1431
00:48:49,440 --> 00:48:51,780
From Pussy Patrol and they're suspended.

1432
00:48:51,780 --> 00:48:54,780
- So XNXX is a website for psychopaths?

1433
00:48:54,780 --> 00:48:56,420
- Well, there's some more.

1434
00:48:56,420 --> 00:48:57,260
- Yeah.

1435
00:48:57,260 --> 00:48:59,740
- Well, they get into some psychopathic topics here.

1436
00:48:59,740 --> 00:49:02,360
Like, has anyone ever seen a snuff film?

1437
00:49:02,360 --> 00:49:03,200
Do you believe it was real?

1438
00:49:03,200 --> 00:49:05,100
- No, but I've seen a sniff film.

1439
00:49:05,100 --> 00:49:07,820
That's right, the Wild Thornberrys movie.

1440
00:49:07,820 --> 00:49:08,940
- Yep.

1441
00:49:08,940 --> 00:49:10,820
Do you think it was real or just good production?

1442
00:49:10,820 --> 00:49:12,580
What was your reaction?

1443
00:49:12,580 --> 00:49:15,820
Just watch some YouTube of shock and ah,

1444
00:49:15,820 --> 00:49:19,700
attack on Baghdad or some of Obama's drone takeouts.

1445
00:49:19,700 --> 00:49:21,220
Hell, don't you watch the news?

1446
00:49:21,220 --> 00:49:22,900
Plenty of snuff videos.

1447
00:49:22,900 --> 00:49:26,060
- That is true, the news has been going wild.

1448
00:49:26,060 --> 00:49:27,420
- Yeah, I haven't seen snuff videos,

1449
00:49:27,420 --> 00:49:29,100
but I've seen stuff videos.

1450
00:49:29,100 --> 00:49:30,300
- Yep.

1451
00:49:30,300 --> 00:49:31,260
- Pretty good amount of stuff videos.

1452
00:49:31,260 --> 00:49:32,620
- Cribs.

1453
00:49:32,620 --> 00:49:33,460
- Yeah.

1454
00:49:33,460 --> 00:49:34,820
- It would be a stuff video.

1455
00:49:34,820 --> 00:49:36,700
- Impractical jokers.

1456
00:49:36,700 --> 00:49:40,300
- There's that motherfucking guy in Louisiana

1457
00:49:40,300 --> 00:49:44,120
who sometimes will make some kind of stuffed chicken.

1458
00:49:44,120 --> 00:49:45,540
- Yeah. - Scalecracker.

1459
00:49:45,540 --> 00:49:47,860
- Is that the guy's like, what happened to who?

1460
00:49:47,860 --> 00:49:48,700
- Yeah.

1461
00:49:48,700 --> 00:49:49,980
- First you put the butter on the grill.

1462
00:49:49,980 --> 00:49:50,820
- Yep, that guy, I love that.

1463
00:49:50,820 --> 00:49:52,860
- Oh my god, I just thought of a really good idea.

1464
00:49:52,860 --> 00:49:53,700
- What?

1465
00:49:53,700 --> 00:49:54,860
- It's like Build-A-Bear workshop.

1466
00:49:54,860 --> 00:49:57,380
It's basically all the same type of steps,

1467
00:49:57,380 --> 00:49:59,900
but it's like a food place.

1468
00:49:59,900 --> 00:50:00,740
- That's pretty good.

1469
00:50:00,740 --> 00:50:02,260
- Oh, where you go down a line and you--

1470
00:50:02,260 --> 00:50:03,820
- Yeah, but it's not like you're,

1471
00:50:03,820 --> 00:50:06,300
like they have the thing where you fill the bear

1472
00:50:06,300 --> 00:50:08,500
with stuffing, but it's with food.

1473
00:50:08,500 --> 00:50:09,420
- What kind of food would you pick?

1474
00:50:09,420 --> 00:50:10,740
- Well, I think you can pick whatever.

1475
00:50:10,740 --> 00:50:12,580
I'm trying to, I'm still puzzling it out.

1476
00:50:12,580 --> 00:50:13,420
I just thought of it as a--

1477
00:50:13,420 --> 00:50:15,660
- It could be mostly liquid or foam.

1478
00:50:15,660 --> 00:50:17,460
- Well no, it could be like, okay,

1479
00:50:17,460 --> 00:50:18,620
it could be a dessert place,

1480
00:50:18,620 --> 00:50:20,820
so maybe you could be making a donut that's filled with--

1481
00:50:20,820 --> 00:50:21,860
- You just invented fro-yo.

1482
00:50:21,860 --> 00:50:24,340
- I would put maybe chipotle--

1483
00:50:24,340 --> 00:50:27,220
- Since when is fro-yo inside of a bear?

1484
00:50:27,220 --> 00:50:28,460
- Oh, you eat it out. - Oh my god.

1485
00:50:28,460 --> 00:50:29,300
- So wait, the bear is made out of--

1486
00:50:29,300 --> 00:50:30,980
- The bear part could be edible too.

1487
00:50:30,980 --> 00:50:33,220
It could be a pastry, it could be anything.

1488
00:50:33,220 --> 00:50:35,620
- Yeah, so you're making kind of a pot pie thing.

1489
00:50:35,620 --> 00:50:37,700
- Well I'm saying, I haven't figured,

1490
00:50:37,700 --> 00:50:40,740
the idea of putting food inside something.

1491
00:50:40,740 --> 00:50:42,120
- That's your idea?

1492
00:50:42,120 --> 00:50:44,680
- Okay, but in a Build-A-Bear workshop setting.

1493
00:50:44,680 --> 00:50:47,800
It's Build-A-Bear workshop, but the bear is edible.

1494
00:50:47,800 --> 00:50:50,360
- You already said that, but what's in the bear?

1495
00:50:50,360 --> 00:50:52,360
- How is that frozen yogurt?

1496
00:50:52,360 --> 00:50:54,020
- Well, I'm not saying it's frozen yogurt anymore,

1497
00:50:54,020 --> 00:50:55,560
I'm just, I don't know what the idea is.

1498
00:50:55,560 --> 00:50:57,000
- Oh, an edible bear. - I'm trying to find

1499
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:57,960
an edible bear.

1500
00:50:57,960 --> 00:50:59,560
- Fine, it's a bear and it's edible.

1501
00:50:59,560 --> 00:51:01,160
- But what's the bear made out of?

1502
00:51:01,160 --> 00:51:03,320
Tortillas. - Some kind of edible food.

1503
00:51:03,320 --> 00:51:05,200
- Just name one. (laughing)

1504
00:51:05,200 --> 00:51:06,400
It's a bear made out of tortillas.

1505
00:51:06,400 --> 00:51:08,240
- Is it tortilla or is it puff pastry?

1506
00:51:08,240 --> 00:51:10,240
- Do you want it to be, okay, do you want it to be,

1507
00:51:10,240 --> 00:51:12,440
there's two stores on there next to each other,

1508
00:51:12,440 --> 00:51:15,300
and one is for desserts and one is for foods.

1509
00:51:15,300 --> 00:51:17,300
And the foods one, it is tortillas,

1510
00:51:17,300 --> 00:51:19,420
and you can put in vegetables and meats inside it.

1511
00:51:19,420 --> 00:51:21,100
And the dessert one, it's some kind of--

1512
00:51:21,100 --> 00:51:23,380
- How did you get to this, how did you jump to this idea?

1513
00:51:23,380 --> 00:51:24,440
- Stuffing!

1514
00:51:24,440 --> 00:51:26,440
- It's a taco place, though.

1515
00:51:26,440 --> 00:51:28,080
- No, because it's in a bar! - Oh my god, wait, no,

1516
00:51:28,080 --> 00:51:29,380
and it's called Stuffings.

1517
00:51:29,380 --> 00:51:30,920
The restaurant is called Stuffings.

1518
00:51:30,920 --> 00:51:32,340
- Which one is, there's two now.

1519
00:51:32,340 --> 00:51:35,180
- It's called Stuffings and Stuffings PM.

1520
00:51:35,180 --> 00:51:37,480
And PM is the dessert one. - PM?

1521
00:51:37,480 --> 00:51:39,100
- Yeah, you eat it in the evening 'cause it's dessert.

1522
00:51:39,100 --> 00:51:41,220
but the other one you can eat any time of the day.

1523
00:51:41,220 --> 00:51:42,940
- There's also a breakfast one called stuffings.

1524
00:51:42,940 --> 00:51:44,580
- Yeah, man, you fill it with eggs.

1525
00:51:44,580 --> 00:51:46,100
- But is it the tortilla again?

1526
00:51:46,100 --> 00:51:46,940
- Yeah.

1527
00:51:46,940 --> 00:51:47,780
- So it's a tortilla that kind of looks like a--

1528
00:51:47,780 --> 00:51:49,580
- Or it could be pancake, it could be pancake.

1529
00:51:49,580 --> 00:51:51,420
- You look crazy right now.

1530
00:51:51,420 --> 00:51:53,220
Your eyes, I've never seen them that wide.

1531
00:51:53,220 --> 00:51:54,060
- You've gone into psychosis.

1532
00:51:54,060 --> 00:51:56,300
- When you are in a psychotic stuffing--

1533
00:51:56,300 --> 00:51:57,140
- It's a good idea that you're--

1534
00:51:57,140 --> 00:51:57,980
- It's a terrible idea.

1535
00:51:57,980 --> 00:51:59,700
- Fighting against for no reason.

1536
00:51:59,700 --> 00:52:01,780
- Because it doesn't, why is the tortilla a bear?

1537
00:52:01,780 --> 00:52:03,620
How do you make a bear-shaped tortilla?

1538
00:52:03,620 --> 00:52:05,580
- Why is that the issue?

1539
00:52:05,580 --> 00:52:06,420
Why, it's--

1540
00:52:06,420 --> 00:52:07,260
- How big is this?

1541
00:52:07,260 --> 00:52:08,100
- Okay, then it's a pita.

1542
00:52:08,100 --> 00:52:08,940
- Why is this a pita?

1543
00:52:08,940 --> 00:52:11,340
- Show me the pita pocket that's shaped like a bear.

1544
00:52:11,340 --> 00:52:12,540
- But why is it a bear?

1545
00:52:12,540 --> 00:52:14,180
It could just be a tortilla.

1546
00:52:14,180 --> 00:52:15,020
- Because then it's not cool.

1547
00:52:15,020 --> 00:52:16,500
- That's the style?

1548
00:52:16,500 --> 00:52:18,580
- That's the cool thing about what you're--

1549
00:52:18,580 --> 00:52:19,540
- Are you paying extra?

1550
00:52:19,540 --> 00:52:20,540
Is it like, how expensive is it?

1551
00:52:20,540 --> 00:52:22,020
- It's just a fun thing.

1552
00:52:22,020 --> 00:52:23,180
- It's not a good idea.

1553
00:52:23,180 --> 00:52:24,020
- Okay.

1554
00:52:24,020 --> 00:52:24,840
- It's a bad idea.

1555
00:52:24,840 --> 00:52:25,680
- Okay, well here, no.

1556
00:52:25,680 --> 00:52:26,520
- It's a bad idea.

1557
00:52:26,520 --> 00:52:28,500
- Here's deleted user who was banned maybe for this post.

1558
00:52:28,500 --> 00:52:29,780
- Caleb goes to every restaurant and he says,

1559
00:52:29,780 --> 00:52:31,060
why isn't this in a slurry?

1560
00:52:31,060 --> 00:52:32,780
Why can't I blend this all up and eat it?

1561
00:52:32,780 --> 00:52:33,620
It's presentation.

1562
00:52:33,620 --> 00:52:36,540
- I think a food Build-A-Bear workshop idea.

1563
00:52:36,540 --> 00:52:37,380
- Yeah, it's a good idea.

1564
00:52:37,380 --> 00:52:38,220
- It's not a good idea.

1565
00:52:38,220 --> 00:52:39,040
- It's a good idea.

1566
00:52:39,040 --> 00:52:39,880
- So tell me just--

1567
00:52:39,880 --> 00:52:40,720
- I think it's a good idea.

1568
00:52:40,720 --> 00:52:43,000
- Okay, so no help from Patrick.

1569
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:43,840
- He was helping me a lot.

1570
00:52:43,840 --> 00:52:44,660
- Walk me down the line.

1571
00:52:44,660 --> 00:52:46,460
- I know, walk me down the line.

1572
00:52:46,460 --> 00:52:48,180
- Okay, do you want the dessert one

1573
00:52:48,180 --> 00:52:50,220
or the dinner one or the breakfast one?

1574
00:52:50,220 --> 00:52:51,540
- Here, no, you walk in and I work there.

1575
00:52:51,540 --> 00:52:52,380
It's the other one.

1576
00:52:52,380 --> 00:52:53,200
- There's no employees.

1577
00:52:53,200 --> 00:52:54,040
- Hi, welcome to Stuffings.

1578
00:52:54,040 --> 00:52:55,220
It's the most fucking stupid idea of all time

1579
00:52:55,220 --> 00:52:56,060
and I work here.

1580
00:52:56,060 --> 00:52:56,880
- There's no employees.

1581
00:52:56,880 --> 00:52:57,940
- No, go ahead, go get your food.

1582
00:52:57,940 --> 00:53:01,780
So if it's the dinner one, you start with bread.

1583
00:53:01,780 --> 00:53:03,620
It's a bread bowl shaped like a bear.

1584
00:53:03,620 --> 00:53:08,060
Are you gonna yell about how a bowl can't be bear shaped?

1585
00:53:08,060 --> 00:53:09,500
- It can, it's just stupid.

1586
00:53:09,500 --> 00:53:12,820
- And then you're like, oh, maybe I want chili in it.

1587
00:53:12,820 --> 00:53:13,980
Maybe I want mac and cheese.

1588
00:53:13,980 --> 00:53:15,500
Maybe I want a mix of both.

1589
00:53:15,500 --> 00:53:17,520
Oh, but if I want both, it costs a little extra.

1590
00:53:17,520 --> 00:53:19,540
Well, I really want chili and mac and cheese mixed,

1591
00:53:19,540 --> 00:53:21,180
so I guess I'll pay a little extra for that.

1592
00:53:21,180 --> 00:53:22,020
And then you get to use,

1593
00:53:22,020 --> 00:53:24,000
and of course there will be other stuff too,

1594
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:25,340
which I'm not good at thinking of food,

1595
00:53:25,340 --> 00:53:27,420
but you can say any food that could be in a bread bowl.

1596
00:53:27,420 --> 00:53:29,000
- I'm not good at thinking.

1597
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:30,400
- 'Cause you're attacking me.

1598
00:53:30,400 --> 00:53:31,240
- Okay.

1599
00:53:31,240 --> 00:53:32,580
- You're putting me in a defense position.

1600
00:53:32,580 --> 00:53:34,520
And then you use the machine where you get to fill it up

1601
00:53:34,520 --> 00:53:35,540
and you get to watch it fill up,

1602
00:53:35,540 --> 00:53:36,960
which is the main fun part.

1603
00:53:36,960 --> 00:53:38,160
The bread is-- - How do you eat it?

1604
00:53:38,160 --> 00:53:39,000
- Then you--

1605
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:40,240
(laughing)

1606
00:53:40,240 --> 00:53:41,880
- Do you cut the head off and eat the brain?

1607
00:53:41,880 --> 00:53:45,280
- No, you just bite into it like it's a burrito.

1608
00:53:45,280 --> 00:53:46,120
- It's a Hot Pocket.

1609
00:53:46,120 --> 00:53:47,160
- Yeah, it's a Hot Pocket.

1610
00:53:47,160 --> 00:53:48,000
- It's a bear-shaped Hot Pocket.

1611
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:49,520
- Okay, I built a bear for a Hot Pocket.

1612
00:53:49,520 --> 00:53:51,480
That still is fine of an idea.

1613
00:53:51,480 --> 00:53:53,280
That's not a thing that exists.

1614
00:53:53,280 --> 00:53:54,480
You're saying it like you're defeating me.

1615
00:53:54,480 --> 00:53:55,440
You're making me stronger.

1616
00:53:55,440 --> 00:53:57,920
- This, him talking about this Build-A-Bear thing

1617
00:53:57,920 --> 00:54:00,680
made me realize I messed up the prompt

1618
00:54:00,680 --> 00:54:03,540
for the research I was supposed to do.

1619
00:54:03,540 --> 00:54:04,960
- 'Cause you were searching psychosis?

1620
00:54:04,960 --> 00:54:06,900
- Yeah, and not psychopathy.

1621
00:54:06,900 --> 00:54:10,800
And, well, I found this poll.

1622
00:54:10,800 --> 00:54:13,280
This will be the last thing I talk about

1623
00:54:13,280 --> 00:54:15,680
on the XNXX forums.

1624
00:54:15,680 --> 00:54:17,840
What are your favorite circumstances for shitting?

1625
00:54:17,840 --> 00:54:21,540
And the favorite time and place to take a shit is

1626
00:54:21,540 --> 00:54:24,040
when I know people are waiting impatiently for the toilet.

1627
00:54:24,040 --> 00:54:25,480
That's psychopath behavior.

1628
00:54:25,480 --> 00:54:26,240
Yeah, that's one of those.

1629
00:54:26,240 --> 00:54:29,120
In the morning after a strong cup of coffee, psychopath.

1630
00:54:29,120 --> 00:54:30,240
That's not a psychopath, that's me.

1631
00:54:30,240 --> 00:54:31,000
That's kind of normal.

1632
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:32,680
Yeah, that's me.

1633
00:54:32,680 --> 00:54:33,240
OK.

1634
00:54:33,240 --> 00:54:35,000
I don't love it, but I wouldn't say it's my favorite.

1635
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:35,880
Out in the woods, in the bushes with a little view.

1636
00:54:35,880 --> 00:54:38,160
It wouldn't be my favorite, but you'd do it enough

1637
00:54:38,160 --> 00:54:39,880
that you'd have to like it at some point.

1638
00:54:39,880 --> 00:54:41,800
Yeah, kind of just normalcy.

1639
00:54:41,800 --> 00:54:44,760
Out in the woods, in the bushes with a little view.

1640
00:54:44,760 --> 00:54:45,920
No, that's not right either.

1641
00:54:45,920 --> 00:54:47,120
That's psychopathic behavior.

1642
00:54:47,120 --> 00:54:48,640
I've never taken an outside poop.

1643
00:54:48,640 --> 00:54:49,040
I don't think I have either.

1644
00:54:49,040 --> 00:54:50,800
When no one else is home and I can really

1645
00:54:50,800 --> 00:54:53,600
take the time to do it right.

1646
00:54:53,600 --> 00:54:58,100
at work maybe around 3 p.m. that's nice on my ex's carpet seeing as how I still

1647
00:54:58,100 --> 00:55:01,800
have a key to that is psychopathic behavior so the most popular is when no

1648
00:55:01,800 --> 00:55:04,480
one else is home and I really take the time to do it right I gotta say I'm a

1649
00:55:04,480 --> 00:55:08,760
full in the morning after a strong cup of coffee yeah I need to have it needs

1650
00:55:08,760 --> 00:55:13,680
to feel like a heart attack I've been in this one here what's my last thing I

1651
00:55:13,680 --> 00:55:20,000
can't click it I can't click it oh I just took my second shit it was so huge

1652
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:25,000
and good I feel lighter excited emoji and then is Donald Trump mentally ill?

1653
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:30,360
Oh you put that Donald Trump stuff. Yeah. Yes yes and yes Donald is mentally ill

1654
00:55:30,360 --> 00:55:35,440
and he is our president how crazy is that you have to love him and you need

1655
00:55:35,440 --> 00:55:41,000
to quit picking on the mentally ill I think and that yeah I really whiffed it

1656
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:47,140
on this one that's okay this whole episode's kind of been. You were out of

1657
00:55:47,140 --> 00:55:48,340
So you were out this weekend.

1658
00:55:48,340 --> 00:55:49,340
I was out this weekend.

1659
00:55:49,340 --> 00:55:51,740
I did not have time to do proper research.

1660
00:55:51,740 --> 00:55:53,940
I was in the lovely city of Boston.

1661
00:55:53,940 --> 00:55:55,240
Yeah, and who cares?

1662
00:55:55,240 --> 00:55:57,140
Yeah, we don't need to hear about this.

1663
00:55:57,140 --> 00:55:58,640
Here's mine.

1664
00:55:58,640 --> 00:56:00,640
I'll go fast, I guess.

1665
00:56:00,640 --> 00:56:04,940
So I looked at r/sociopath on Reddit,

1666
00:56:04,940 --> 00:56:08,540
which is a community for the empathetically challenged.

1667
00:56:08,540 --> 00:56:11,640
And I love this vaporwave style header photo.

1668
00:56:11,640 --> 00:56:12,240
It's pretty cool.

1669
00:56:12,240 --> 00:56:14,840
I put it in there because I thought it was kind of aesthetic.

1670
00:56:14,840 --> 00:56:16,640
It's kind of reminding me of, speaking of The Simpsons,

1671
00:56:16,640 --> 00:56:20,240
maybe Bart with some sleepy eyes driving down the street.

1672
00:56:20,240 --> 00:56:21,080
- Yeah, true.

1673
00:56:21,080 --> 00:56:21,900
- Yeah.

1674
00:56:21,900 --> 00:56:22,740
- Yeah.

1675
00:56:22,740 --> 00:56:24,300
- I think the statute of limitations on speaking of

1676
00:56:24,300 --> 00:56:25,820
was up on The Simpsons.

1677
00:56:25,820 --> 00:56:27,120
Took me a second to remember we were speaking

1678
00:56:27,120 --> 00:56:27,960
of The Simpsons.

1679
00:56:27,960 --> 00:56:28,800
- Uh-huh, hmm.

1680
00:56:28,800 --> 00:56:30,960
Hell, we can speak of The Simpsons.

1681
00:56:30,960 --> 00:56:32,960
- That's true, I guess The Simpsons is ever green,

1682
00:56:32,960 --> 00:56:33,800
ever yellow.

1683
00:56:33,800 --> 00:56:35,800
- Shit, man.

1684
00:56:35,800 --> 00:56:38,160
- There's multiple, there's multiple,

1685
00:56:38,160 --> 00:56:42,200
there's also r/psychopath and r/psychopathy,

1686
00:56:42,200 --> 00:56:45,660
but they're all, so I forget which one is which,

1687
00:56:45,660 --> 00:56:48,340
but there's one of them that's only people saying,

1688
00:56:48,340 --> 00:56:50,340
I wanna fucking kill and eat a pregnant woman,

1689
00:56:50,340 --> 00:56:52,900
I'm fucking evil, and then half of it is also like,

1690
00:56:52,900 --> 00:56:54,420
can we get these trolls out of here?

1691
00:56:54,420 --> 00:56:55,260
And that's all it is.

1692
00:56:55,260 --> 00:56:57,540
And there's one that's been like banned.

1693
00:56:57,540 --> 00:56:58,580
And then there's one that's like

1694
00:56:58,580 --> 00:57:00,760
from a purely psychological standpoint,

1695
00:57:00,760 --> 00:57:02,840
and it's all like therapists talking.

1696
00:57:02,840 --> 00:57:04,260
But this is the only interesting one,

1697
00:57:04,260 --> 00:57:06,580
r/sociopath, I had to find it.

1698
00:57:06,580 --> 00:57:09,100
So let's look at some posts from r/sociopath.

1699
00:57:09,100 --> 00:57:12,380
How competitive, they wrote, are you at games?

1700
00:57:12,380 --> 00:57:13,620
- This is NSFW.

1701
00:57:13,620 --> 00:57:15,340
- Everything on this subreddit is NSFW.

1702
00:57:15,340 --> 00:57:19,100
I hope so. I don't want to be, can you imagine your boss walking in on you looking at the

1703
00:57:19,100 --> 00:57:24,300
r/sociopath thing? Yeah. And then he would probably go, yeah me too because I'm the boss.

1704
00:57:24,300 --> 00:57:28,940
Damn. He'd go, wait. Wait. And he's like even more than you. Bosses are sociopaths. Yeah.

1705
00:57:28,940 --> 00:57:33,260
Hold on, that's actually scary in a societal way. That makes hella sense. I'd have my sound

1706
00:57:33,260 --> 00:57:40,860
board next to me and go, hold up. Yeah. Hold up. Hey! If you're always winning, then it's

1707
00:57:40,860 --> 00:57:45,180
just repetitive and boring. No challenge, nothing new, you know? And then someone else

1708
00:57:45,180 --> 00:57:48,480
response and says do you always win and they reply and say not always but I try

1709
00:57:48,480 --> 00:57:52,680
to do you always win I said if you're always winning it's boring and then

1710
00:57:52,680 --> 00:57:57,000
they're like well I don't always win the always I would just lie and just say

1711
00:57:57,000 --> 00:58:01,240
yeah yeah I'm a sociopath yeah I want exactly why to get my way

1712
00:58:01,240 --> 00:58:06,480
yep yeah I spent three years in prison over a monopoly game extremely wrong I

1713
00:58:06,480 --> 00:58:11,280
don't I don't believe that I thought it was funny though it is funny but that

1714
00:58:11,280 --> 00:58:12,980
- I'm not that motherfucking lying about that shit.

1715
00:58:12,980 --> 00:58:14,860
- Again, it's r/sociopath.

1716
00:58:14,860 --> 00:58:16,320
- So you think that they're all--

1717
00:58:16,320 --> 00:58:17,280
- They're all lying.

1718
00:58:17,280 --> 00:58:18,120
- 'Cause they're sociopaths.

1719
00:58:18,120 --> 00:58:20,600
- They are compulsive liars from being sociopathic.

1720
00:58:20,600 --> 00:58:21,920
- Can we even trust them on the point

1721
00:58:21,920 --> 00:58:22,760
that they're sociopaths?

1722
00:58:22,760 --> 00:58:24,120
- I really don't think we can.

1723
00:58:24,120 --> 00:58:24,960
- That's kind of scary.

1724
00:58:24,960 --> 00:58:26,080
- Which is one of the funny things,

1725
00:58:26,080 --> 00:58:27,840
is a lot of people are trying really hard

1726
00:58:27,840 --> 00:58:29,760
to be sociopaths on here.

1727
00:58:29,760 --> 00:58:30,680
It's very funny.

1728
00:58:30,680 --> 00:58:33,800
What do you fantasize about?

1729
00:58:33,800 --> 00:58:36,480
Violence, fame, money, success, power?

1730
00:58:36,480 --> 00:58:37,320
It can be anything.

1731
00:58:37,320 --> 00:58:39,480
Fantasies can tell a lot about a person's mental state

1732
00:58:39,480 --> 00:58:40,760
and overall mentality.

1733
00:58:40,760 --> 00:58:43,160
More specifically, their desires and dreams.

1734
00:58:43,160 --> 00:58:45,160
Here's what one person fantasizes about.

1735
00:58:45,160 --> 00:58:47,440
I've been a DM for over, a dungeon master,

1736
00:58:47,440 --> 00:58:49,620
for over 25 years and I've helped others fantasize

1737
00:58:49,620 --> 00:58:51,960
about magic realms, gritty industrial landscapes

1738
00:58:51,960 --> 00:58:54,400
of concrete and steel, vast oceanic flows

1739
00:58:54,400 --> 00:58:56,640
that enable ships and exceptionally strong swimmers

1740
00:58:56,640 --> 00:58:59,220
to travel between worlds, of realms where mankind

1741
00:58:59,220 --> 00:59:01,680
dominates all, where mankind struggles to exist,

1742
00:59:01,680 --> 00:59:03,800
and where mankind never existed at all.

1743
00:59:03,800 --> 00:59:06,600
Magical swords with demented spirits shackled to them,

1744
00:59:06,600 --> 00:59:08,080
seeking to enslave or serve.

1745
00:59:08,080 --> 00:59:10,100
whoever dares to wield them,

1746
00:59:10,100 --> 00:59:11,880
psychic powers and divine entities

1747
00:59:11,880 --> 00:59:13,600
clashing with future tech giants

1748
00:59:13,600 --> 00:59:15,480
of ceramic plate and fusion drives,

1749
00:59:15,480 --> 00:59:19,000
whimsical elves, hardworking and hard partying dwarves,

1750
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:21,800
and other races that would take too long to explain.

1751
00:59:21,800 --> 00:59:23,600
What do I fantasize about?

1752
00:59:23,600 --> 00:59:24,440
Everything.

1753
00:59:24,440 --> 00:59:26,800
- Can you read through all of that?

1754
00:59:26,800 --> 00:59:28,200
That is all gun city.

1755
00:59:28,200 --> 00:59:29,040
- Yeah, that is word for word.

1756
00:59:29,040 --> 00:59:29,880
- That is gun city, word for word.

1757
00:59:29,880 --> 00:59:31,480
- That's starting to worry me a lot

1758
00:59:31,480 --> 00:59:33,560
that maybe Patches has some psychotic behavior.

1759
00:59:33,560 --> 00:59:35,640
- This was the top comment on this too.

1760
00:59:35,640 --> 00:59:36,600
Everyone else was saying like,

1761
00:59:36,600 --> 00:59:40,500
Yeah, sometimes I fantasize about beating up a woman and killing her and chopping her up.

1762
00:59:40,500 --> 00:59:43,100
And that's what everyone uploaded this one instead.

1763
00:59:43,100 --> 00:59:47,600
Is there a psychopath test that's like basically a riddle?

1764
00:59:47,600 --> 00:59:48,300
Yeah.

1765
00:59:48,300 --> 00:59:48,900
But...

1766
00:59:48,900 --> 00:59:49,400
Why don't we do that?

1767
00:59:49,400 --> 00:59:50,800
Are they a Blade Runner?

1768
00:59:50,800 --> 00:59:52,800
No, no, no.

1769
00:59:52,800 --> 00:59:54,700
No, there's some little riddle.

1770
00:59:54,700 --> 00:59:56,100
Yeah, we'll do it at the end, but you can finish it.

1771
00:59:56,100 --> 00:59:58,000
Okay.

1772
00:59:58,000 --> 00:59:59,500
What is your favorite music genre?

1773
00:59:59,500 --> 01:00:00,000
Psycho Billy.

1774
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:00,900
Okay, can we guess?

1775
01:00:00,900 --> 01:00:01,200
Yeah.

1776
01:00:01,200 --> 01:00:02,000
Psycho Billy.

1777
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:02,800
Hip-hop.

1778
01:00:02,800 --> 01:00:03,400
Rockabilly.

1779
01:00:03,400 --> 01:00:05,400
There is a lot of hip-hop, a lot of metal.

1780
01:00:05,400 --> 01:00:10,740
they said metal and hip hop. I really like, there's a new innovation, I think it's the

1781
01:00:10,740 --> 01:00:16,780
next one here, in type of music. Here we go. Video game OSTs, original soundtracks are

1782
01:00:16,780 --> 01:00:20,760
my favorite. Apart from that, I listen to almost every genre. I've always hated country

1783
01:00:20,760 --> 01:00:27,860
and opera. It's so funny to me, I listen to everything except country and opera. Imagine

1784
01:00:27,860 --> 01:00:31,400
that you say you listen to everything and someone would be like, "Oh, so you like opera?"

1785
01:00:31,400 --> 01:00:32,240
- Yeah.

1786
01:00:32,240 --> 01:00:34,240
- It's like, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

1787
01:00:34,240 --> 01:00:35,840
- Yeah, opera equals crap.

1788
01:00:35,840 --> 01:00:39,000
- I'm fine with rap, but I do not like opera.

1789
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:41,080
- Opera is, I will say, opera's terrible.

1790
01:00:41,080 --> 01:00:41,920
I don't listen to opera.

1791
01:00:41,920 --> 01:00:44,480
- No, I wouldn't listen, yeah, I think it's kind of like a,

1792
01:00:44,480 --> 01:00:46,360
it's a tacit agreement that everybody assumes

1793
01:00:46,360 --> 01:00:47,960
when you say everything, you don't mean opera.

1794
01:00:47,960 --> 01:00:50,280
- Yeah, I don't like opera, I don't like ringtones.

1795
01:00:50,280 --> 01:00:51,880
- All these opera singers are going,

1796
01:00:51,880 --> 01:00:55,320
me, me, me, me, me, I don't care about you, you, you, you.

1797
01:00:55,320 --> 01:00:58,240
- Yeah, sing about me, me, me, me, me, me.

1798
01:00:58,240 --> 01:01:00,880
- And my friends, my friends, my friends, my friends.

1799
01:01:00,880 --> 01:01:02,880
- My experience, my experiences, my experiences,

1800
01:01:02,880 --> 01:01:04,220
my experiences.

1801
01:01:04,220 --> 01:01:06,120
(laughing)

1802
01:01:06,120 --> 01:01:08,040
- 50s doo-wop and 90s grunge.

1803
01:01:08,040 --> 01:01:10,640
- Okay, I like the decade.

1804
01:01:10,640 --> 01:01:15,000
What I would listen to, 90s doo-wop and 50s grunge.

1805
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:15,840
Oh, fuck me.

1806
01:01:15,840 --> 01:01:17,960
- I think 50s doo-wop is the most chilling thing

1807
01:01:17,960 --> 01:01:19,120
a psychopath can listen to.

1808
01:01:19,120 --> 01:01:19,960
- I agree.

1809
01:01:19,960 --> 01:01:21,480
- And 90s grunge is the most chill thing.

1810
01:01:21,480 --> 01:01:22,320
- Yep.

1811
01:01:22,320 --> 01:01:23,980
- Yeah, I just went there.

1812
01:01:23,980 --> 01:01:26,360
If your life was a movie, what would viewers think?

1813
01:01:26,360 --> 01:01:27,200
- What the fuck?

1814
01:01:27,200 --> 01:01:28,600
- Damn, that's a cold ass honky.

1815
01:01:28,600 --> 01:01:31,060
- Yeah, I just picked one from here.

1816
01:01:31,060 --> 01:01:31,900
- They'd puke.

1817
01:01:31,900 --> 01:01:34,140
(laughing)

1818
01:01:34,140 --> 01:01:39,020
- No elaboration at all.

1819
01:01:39,020 --> 01:01:39,860
Yo, what up?

1820
01:01:39,860 --> 01:01:40,700
What up, peoples?

1821
01:01:40,700 --> 01:01:42,900
(laughing)

1822
01:01:42,900 --> 01:01:44,740
- That's a post on our site, Sociopathic.

1823
01:01:44,740 --> 01:01:46,020
- That is sociopathic shit.

1824
01:01:46,020 --> 01:01:47,480
- Yo, what up?

1825
01:01:47,480 --> 01:01:48,320
- Yo, what up?

1826
01:01:48,320 --> 01:01:51,060
- What are your opinions on having kids?

1827
01:01:51,060 --> 01:01:52,180
- Here's what, okay, can I?

1828
01:01:52,180 --> 01:01:53,020
- Yeah.

1829
01:01:53,020 --> 01:01:54,260
- If I'm responding to this, I'm saying,

1830
01:01:54,260 --> 01:01:56,620
hmm, kids are pretty good for dinner.

1831
01:01:56,620 --> 01:01:58,540
That would be my sociopathic response.

1832
01:01:58,540 --> 01:02:04,240
I like having kids for lunch and dinner. Yeah, and most of them say I don't care for kids very much

1833
01:02:04,240 --> 01:02:10,980
They say I think they're a little crotch goblins. Oh, they all say that a bunch. That's like they're that's like they're agreed

1834
01:02:10,980 --> 01:02:13,100
That's like calling someone an ass clown. I guess

1835
01:02:13,100 --> 01:02:19,840
It's yeah, it's a thing that everyone thought was a funny thing to say now. They all say it call kids crotch cockroach goblin

1836
01:02:19,840 --> 01:02:26,100
Yeah, but this person says it would be really cool to have a demon like child who I can teach to manipulate and conquer everything

1837
01:02:26,100 --> 01:02:28,100
- What did you blur out on?

1838
01:02:28,100 --> 01:02:30,440
- I don't know why it's black, it's supposed to be white.

1839
01:02:30,440 --> 01:02:31,500
I was trying to crop it.

1840
01:02:31,500 --> 01:02:32,340
- Oh, okay.

1841
01:02:32,340 --> 01:02:34,200
- It's just not funny, it's just a longer comment.

1842
01:02:34,200 --> 01:02:35,040
- Oh, okay.

1843
01:02:35,040 --> 01:02:36,620
- Yeah, I don't know why it's all,

1844
01:02:36,620 --> 01:02:37,740
it's supposed to be white.

1845
01:02:37,740 --> 01:02:39,020
- I thought you were making your sensory--

1846
01:02:39,020 --> 01:02:40,860
- No, you can move it if you want.

1847
01:02:40,860 --> 01:02:42,700
- I thought maybe that was that guy's full name.

1848
01:02:42,700 --> 01:02:43,540
- No.

1849
01:02:43,540 --> 01:02:44,360
- It was that long.

1850
01:02:44,360 --> 01:02:45,820
- Full name and address.

1851
01:02:45,820 --> 01:02:49,380
- And I live here, and this is my full name.

1852
01:02:49,380 --> 01:02:51,020
It would be cool to have a demon-like child.

1853
01:02:51,020 --> 01:02:51,860
- No.

1854
01:02:51,860 --> 01:02:52,680
- Not a demon child.

1855
01:02:52,680 --> 01:02:53,520
- Conquer everything.

1856
01:02:53,520 --> 01:02:54,360
- A demon-like child.

1857
01:02:54,360 --> 01:02:56,360
- I don't think I'd want a demon-like child.

1858
01:02:56,360 --> 01:02:58,080
- Well because you would be bad at raising him.

1859
01:02:58,080 --> 01:02:59,520
- I would not want a demon-like child

1860
01:02:59,520 --> 01:03:01,840
unless I could manipulate them.

1861
01:03:01,840 --> 01:03:03,360
- Yeah, into conquering.

1862
01:03:03,360 --> 01:03:06,000
- 'Cause if they are against me, I'm toast.

1863
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:07,480
I'm not demon-like. - True.

1864
01:03:07,480 --> 01:03:09,840
- I maybe have demonic thoughts.

1865
01:03:09,840 --> 01:03:12,360
- But also, you have dad strength.

1866
01:03:12,360 --> 01:03:13,200
- True.

1867
01:03:13,200 --> 01:03:14,020
- So if a demon--

1868
01:03:14,020 --> 01:03:15,200
- I could twist their little head off.

1869
01:03:15,200 --> 01:03:17,400
- Yeah, I'd grab 'em by their ear.

1870
01:03:17,400 --> 01:03:18,240
- Yeah.

1871
01:03:18,240 --> 01:03:19,060
- Come here!

1872
01:03:19,060 --> 01:03:19,900
- Or their horn maybe.

1873
01:03:19,900 --> 01:03:20,920
- Yeah, you grab 'em by the horn for sure

1874
01:03:20,920 --> 01:03:22,800
'cause that's where all those sensitive bones--

1875
01:03:22,800 --> 01:03:24,680
I grab demon-like children by the horns.

1876
01:03:24,680 --> 01:03:25,520
Yeah.

1877
01:03:25,520 --> 01:03:26,340
Yeah, straight up.

1878
01:03:26,340 --> 01:03:28,040
You grab it by both their horns,

1879
01:03:28,040 --> 01:03:30,240
'cause the ears, they're gonna scream.

1880
01:03:30,240 --> 01:03:31,080
You know.

1881
01:03:31,080 --> 01:03:32,960
And I'm throwing 'em, doing a whole sideways spin around.

1882
01:03:32,960 --> 01:03:33,800
Mario, Bowser.

1883
01:03:33,800 --> 01:03:34,760
We're throwing Mario, Bowser.

1884
01:03:34,760 --> 01:03:35,680
Trunchbull.

1885
01:03:35,680 --> 01:03:36,520
Yeah, and then I throw 'em into--

1886
01:03:36,520 --> 01:03:39,840
That would be my demon kid's name, Trunchbull.

1887
01:03:39,840 --> 01:03:42,800
But it would be sad as fuck when you get

1888
01:03:42,800 --> 01:03:46,120
to the fucking kingdom of heaven and your son is--

1889
01:03:46,120 --> 01:03:46,960
Not allowed.

1890
01:03:46,960 --> 01:03:47,920
Yeah, because of how he looks.

1891
01:03:47,920 --> 01:03:48,740
True.

1892
01:03:48,740 --> 01:03:49,580
And you say, wait,

1893
01:03:49,580 --> 01:03:51,440
that's fucking heavenistic racism.

1894
01:03:51,440 --> 01:03:52,720
- Would they let you into heaven

1895
01:03:52,720 --> 01:03:54,520
if you had a demon-like child?

1896
01:03:54,520 --> 01:03:55,360
- If you had a whole--

1897
01:03:55,360 --> 01:03:56,200
- Or by association with--

1898
01:03:56,200 --> 01:03:57,020
- No, you're fine. - Yeah, you'd probably go to--

1899
01:03:57,020 --> 01:03:59,240
- You probably fucked a demon to get a demon-like child.

1900
01:03:59,240 --> 01:04:01,560
- You could probably have a nice-ass spot in hell, though,

1901
01:04:01,560 --> 01:04:03,000
'cause it's like, damn, like--

1902
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:05,040
- If there's one thing about hell,

1903
01:04:05,040 --> 01:04:08,880
I hope there is no fire in hell,

1904
01:04:08,880 --> 01:04:10,600
'cause I do not wanna get burned.

1905
01:04:10,600 --> 01:04:12,440
- Here's my-- - I got some bad news for you.

1906
01:04:12,440 --> 01:04:13,680
- As long as it's not-- - It's pretty much

1907
01:04:13,680 --> 01:04:15,080
mostly fire. - It's fire.

1908
01:04:15,080 --> 01:04:18,480
- As long as it's not red, then I'm fine with hell.

1909
01:04:18,480 --> 01:04:20,160
- Okay, I-- - You are in for

1910
01:04:20,160 --> 01:04:23,160
- Hell sounds kinda poppin'.

1911
01:04:23,160 --> 01:04:24,000
- Yeah.

1912
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:26,320
- I kinda like the idea of it, but I really don't,

1913
01:04:26,320 --> 01:04:28,840
as long as there's not a guy in charge named the devil.

1914
01:04:28,840 --> 01:04:30,160
- Yeah, that would suck.

1915
01:04:30,160 --> 01:04:31,000
- What?

1916
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:31,840
- Bruv.

1917
01:04:31,840 --> 01:04:32,680
- What?

1918
01:04:32,680 --> 01:04:34,320
- You're not gonna like it.

1919
01:04:34,320 --> 01:04:35,360
- I just don't wanna go to heaven.

1920
01:04:35,360 --> 01:04:36,440
I don't wanna go to heaven 'cause I hear

1921
01:04:36,440 --> 01:04:39,840
it's full of brimstone, and I fuckin' hate that shit.

1922
01:04:39,840 --> 01:04:41,360
So I think I'd rather go to hell.

1923
01:04:41,360 --> 01:04:42,200
- Yeah.

1924
01:04:42,200 --> 01:04:45,440
Do you leave a trail of destruction?

1925
01:04:45,440 --> 01:04:47,900
Looking back on all my life, the groups that I joined

1926
01:04:47,900 --> 01:04:50,260
always ended up with conflict within.

1927
01:04:50,260 --> 01:04:52,780
- I bet there's plenty of big fatties

1928
01:04:52,780 --> 01:04:55,340
that do leave a trail of destruction on this website.

1929
01:04:55,340 --> 01:04:57,240
- This person left a trail of destruction.

1930
01:04:57,240 --> 01:04:59,060
Yeah, I have a proven track record

1931
01:04:59,060 --> 01:05:00,940
of angering others into apoplexy.

1932
01:05:00,940 --> 01:05:01,780
- Whoa!

1933
01:05:01,780 --> 01:05:03,820
- Whether that be with my grammar Nazism,

1934
01:05:03,820 --> 01:05:07,380
my astute observations, my cynical and nihilistic worldview,

1935
01:05:07,380 --> 01:05:09,260
or my blatant hostile disregard

1936
01:05:09,260 --> 01:05:10,720
for those with religious beliefs,

1937
01:05:10,720 --> 01:05:13,040
yes, I have left many swaths of destruction

1938
01:05:13,040 --> 01:05:14,460
online and in person.

1939
01:05:14,460 --> 01:05:15,580
- Swaths.

1940
01:05:15,580 --> 01:05:17,380
- That's so cool to list all those.

1941
01:05:17,380 --> 01:05:18,220
- Yeah.

1942
01:05:18,220 --> 01:05:19,220
- Am I cynical or nihilistic?

1943
01:05:19,220 --> 01:05:20,460
World view.

1944
01:05:20,460 --> 01:05:22,700
- My grammar, opening with my grammar and Nazism

1945
01:05:22,700 --> 01:05:23,540
is so funny.

1946
01:05:23,540 --> 01:05:24,360
- Yeah.

1947
01:05:24,360 --> 01:05:26,060
- I've left a trail of destruction.

1948
01:05:26,060 --> 01:05:26,900
- That's the first one you want people to know about.

1949
01:05:26,900 --> 01:05:29,780
- I've caused in-group conflict by correcting people's

1950
01:05:29,780 --> 01:05:31,540
grammar. - Did you mean your?

1951
01:05:31,540 --> 01:05:32,380
- Yeah.

1952
01:05:32,380 --> 01:05:33,220
- Hmm.

1953
01:05:33,220 --> 01:05:36,620
- Okay.

1954
01:05:36,620 --> 01:05:37,540
Be honest.

1955
01:05:37,540 --> 01:05:40,540
Do you actually give a fuck about what's happening

1956
01:05:40,540 --> 01:05:41,380
in Ukraine?

1957
01:05:41,380 --> 01:05:42,200
- No!

1958
01:05:42,200 --> 01:05:43,040
- And this is a poll.

1959
01:05:43,040 --> 01:05:44,820
- These psychos better, okay.

1960
01:05:44,820 --> 01:05:47,300
- And now I have, I said it, this is my last thing.

1961
01:05:47,300 --> 01:05:49,440
I set up a little thing for it.

1962
01:05:49,440 --> 01:05:50,280
It's game time.

1963
01:05:50,280 --> 01:05:51,820
- Whee, yay!

1964
01:05:51,820 --> 01:05:52,780
- It's game time, y'all.

1965
01:05:52,780 --> 01:05:53,620
- Okay.

1966
01:05:53,620 --> 01:05:56,920
- Out of 788 voters,

1967
01:05:56,920 --> 01:05:59,580
that's how many people voted in this poll,

1968
01:05:59,580 --> 01:06:02,940
how many sociopaths do you think voted yes,

1969
01:06:02,940 --> 01:06:04,600
they do actually give a fuck

1970
01:06:04,600 --> 01:06:06,420
about what's happening in Ukraine?

1971
01:06:06,420 --> 01:06:07,520
- Just multiple choice?

1972
01:06:07,520 --> 01:06:08,360
- No.

1973
01:06:08,360 --> 01:06:09,660
- Okay, I'm guessing zero.

1974
01:06:09,660 --> 01:06:11,780
- Go as close as you can,

1975
01:06:11,780 --> 01:06:14,020
without going over, I guess, will be our--

1976
01:06:14,020 --> 01:06:15,300
- 25.

1977
01:06:15,300 --> 01:06:16,140
- 25, okay.

1978
01:06:16,140 --> 01:06:21,220
And I guess zero you guess zero have seven a do you guys are both gonna be surprised out of seven hundred and eighty-eight

1979
01:06:21,220 --> 01:06:24,420
psychopaths, okay, even psychopaths

1980
01:06:24,420 --> 01:06:31,700
305 of them realize that what is going on in Ukraine will not stand on the pale

1981
01:06:31,700 --> 01:06:33,500
What's it is not?

1982
01:06:33,500 --> 01:06:34,000
Okay

1983
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:40,220
Even a person with no human emotion feelings who wants to literally grab a woman in an alley and have his way with her

1984
01:06:40,220 --> 01:06:42,220
Yeah, what's close that Putin?

1985
01:06:43,060 --> 01:06:46,860
Must be stopped even guys with claws think that food needs to be so Patrick one

1986
01:06:46,860 --> 01:06:51,180
Fuck me. Yeah, I was closer keep calm and claim your prize

1987
01:06:51,180 --> 01:06:58,620
And you may remember I asked you for a suggestion earlier. I said something Caleb. Yes and Patrick your prize is

1988
01:06:58,620 --> 01:07:01,420
food

1989
01:07:01,420 --> 01:07:05,060
We'll get you

1990
01:07:05,060 --> 01:07:07,660
Look up psychopath test

1991
01:07:07,660 --> 01:07:11,620
I know that there's a psychopath test and I want to do it right now because I am getting

1992
01:07:11,980 --> 01:07:14,860
more scared by the second that one of the us three might be a

1993
01:07:14,860 --> 01:07:18,460
Okay, who do you think well? How are we all gonna? Take it?

1994
01:07:18,460 --> 01:07:22,660
We just just we all go okay. This is a quiz. We'll just do it really

1995
01:07:22,660 --> 01:07:28,520
We'll just do we open three tabs. Yeah, okay, we'll do it as a group, okay?

1996
01:07:28,520 --> 01:07:32,060
Most would describe me as charming and nonchalant. I can turn my charm on and off like a faucet

1997
01:07:32,060 --> 01:07:35,180
I would say me this is definitely this describes me plus

1998
01:07:35,180 --> 01:07:40,380
Maybe wanting to drink people's blood and eat their teeth, so let's go this is definitely me

1999
01:07:40,380 --> 01:07:44,460
Uh-huh. I do what I want, when I want, and the moment the impulse strikes me

2000
01:07:44,460 --> 01:07:48,820
regardless of what others want. Yeah. That's all three of us, right? Yeah. If something goes

2001
01:07:48,820 --> 01:07:53,420
wrong or turns out badly, it's not my fault. Me, definitely me. Especially really hurtingly

2002
01:07:53,420 --> 01:07:57,340
people in a bloodly way. I've gotten into legal or criminal trouble as an adult,

2003
01:07:57,340 --> 01:08:01,140
not just a speeding or parking ticket. This is definitely me. Yeah, you, parking tickets with

2004
01:08:01,140 --> 01:08:05,940
you, I've hurt a lot. I'm easily the best at what I do, bar none, nobody could ever take my place.

2005
01:08:05,940 --> 01:08:06,780
This is definitely me.

2006
01:08:06,780 --> 01:08:08,660
For proof, watch this episode back.

2007
01:08:08,660 --> 01:08:10,060
Run it back, this was fire.

2008
01:08:10,060 --> 01:08:11,700
This is the best episode we've ever done.

2009
01:08:11,700 --> 01:08:13,260
I do whatever I feel like doing

2010
01:08:13,260 --> 01:08:14,540
and I don't care what others think,

2011
01:08:14,540 --> 01:08:15,940
or even if it's illegal.

2012
01:08:15,940 --> 01:08:16,780
Me.

2013
01:08:16,780 --> 01:08:17,620
Skateboarding for me.

2014
01:08:17,620 --> 01:08:18,440
For sure.

2015
01:08:18,440 --> 01:08:19,500
Every person for themselves,

2016
01:08:19,500 --> 01:08:21,340
I don't see the point in feeling sorry for other people

2017
01:08:21,340 --> 01:08:23,140
and have no desire to help others.

2018
01:08:23,140 --> 01:08:25,500
This is me as fuck.

2019
01:08:25,500 --> 01:08:26,340
Yeah, no, it is kind of me.

2020
01:08:26,340 --> 01:08:27,420
That's me AF.

2021
01:08:27,420 --> 01:08:29,260
I've gotten into legal or criminal trouble

2022
01:08:29,260 --> 01:08:30,100
when I was a teenager.

2023
01:08:30,100 --> 01:08:31,020
No, not when I was a teen.

2024
01:08:31,020 --> 01:08:31,860
Not when I was a teen.

2025
01:08:31,860 --> 01:08:32,680
No, no, no, no, no.

2026
01:08:32,680 --> 01:08:33,520
Something snapped.

2027
01:08:33,520 --> 01:08:34,360
Oh, I did though.

2028
01:08:34,360 --> 01:08:35,180
You did?

2029
01:08:35,180 --> 01:08:40,060

2030
01:08:40,060 --> 01:08:47,080
me not me day that's right that's right I live in the moment there's what I say

2031
01:08:47,080 --> 01:08:50,500
the future will take care of itself and learning from your past is pointless me

2032
01:08:50,500 --> 01:08:55,700

2034
01:08:59,140 --> 01:09:03,380
pretty small let's get there's a psychopath the 24 out of 24 that's a

2035
01:09:03,380 --> 01:09:05,380
100% and it's only likely

2036
01:09:05,380 --> 01:09:09,160
That's probably cuz our weird three of us because it knows it was a sweet

2037
01:09:09,160 --> 01:09:14,820
Yeah, so what that means that one of us is likely a psychopath likely identified 16 who the hell is clickly?
