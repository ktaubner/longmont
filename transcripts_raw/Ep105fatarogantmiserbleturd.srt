sex scenes? Really? Yeah, he did.

54
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:54,280
I gotta look that up, but Screech, yeah, Screech used a stunt

55
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:58,000
stunt double. You mean Scrat? I think Scrat was the one that did that. Yeah, Scrat. Yeah,

56
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:12,180
Scrat sex tape. He used a stunt double. Screeched full movie X videos. Nice. It is, um, user

57
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:20,620
reviews, 8 out of 10. That's pretty good. Funny, maybe. Witty, no. The thing is though,

58
00:02:20,620 --> 00:02:28,300
porn video has like a 90% thumbs up rating yeah every really heinously bad

59
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:32,660
yeah okay so these are unless it's a misleading title it's like you're

60
00:02:32,660 --> 00:02:38,660
peach and it's not actually Mario fucking peach you know remove this video

61
00:02:38,660 --> 00:02:43,700
at once this is disgusting yeah it's like Allison Brie fucks Donald Trump and

62
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:48,500
it's just like it's like a like a sad middle-aged like Latina lady fucking an

63
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:52,940
old guy yeah this is death this is not Allison Brie Allison Brie has a freckle

64
00:02:52,940 --> 00:02:56,420
on her left leg honestly I'm disgusted you would host a video like this on your

65
00:02:56,420 --> 00:03:01,660
platform there's a whole connection on the page on IMDB for screeched and it

66
00:03:01,660 --> 00:03:06,980
says references so these are the references that screech makes in the

67
00:03:06,980 --> 00:03:17,060
end of like an academic paper no no but so the first reference is to Zorro the

68
00:03:17,060 --> 00:03:29,200
TV series from 1957 and it says in quotes "like Zorro". The second one... so there's

69
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:32,720
also a section called spoofs so you this is kind of like the Wikipedia thing where

70
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:35,240
you go and you click like the numbers and then it brings you to a different

71
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:39,960
page so it says spoofs Dustin hums the Jaws theme as he sticks his penis out of

72
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:46,920
the water in the tub. So in references it says girl mentions the title after

73
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:54,680
Dustin's Jaws parody. Is it Balls? Oh no but if I don't think he thought of that

74
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:59,760
but I think retroactively you could tell. Balls B-A-W-L-S. We need to message

75
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:05,040
Dustin Diamond and tell him hey man really loved your movie from 2006. Well

76
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:10,920
the cover of Balls would be like a just a pair of balls. It would just be a pair of

77
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:14,760
No, not even that it would just be like a like a medical photo of balls

78
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:21,560
Yeah, just red font balls and also there's still a woman in a flame

79
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:24,600
Yeah on a floaty hyper detailed

80
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:31,640
Here the last like to write one of them says like ref the title is a reference to dusted diamonds characters screech blah blah blah

81
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:37,120
And then it says 24 it ref the movie references 24 and the only reference

82
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:41,500
IMDB has is it says, "I want to watch the rest of 24."

83
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:44,880
And then the last one...

84
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:46,200
No, it referenced 24.

85
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:47,760
It took place in real time.

86
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:51,140
Yeah, it took place in 24 hours.

87
00:04:51,140 --> 00:04:57,880
And then this one here, it says there is a reference to Girls Gone Wild on Campus 2.

88
00:04:57,880 --> 00:04:58,920
That's naughty.

89
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:00,740
And it says that the...

90
00:05:00,740 --> 00:05:02,460
Every porn references that.

91
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:10,620
reference is TV star gone wild I thought it was gonna be like yeah there's a

92
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:16,300
there's a scene with a topless woman yeah clearly a reference to any any movie

93
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:21,420
that has I'm gonna go on to IMDB and do that now like go into like some every

94
00:05:21,420 --> 00:05:26,760

95
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:30,340
boobs and it's like do brown here is a reference yeah brown bunny this is a

96
00:05:30,340 --> 00:05:33,060
This is a clear reference to the Kim K sex tape.

97
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:36,180
This is a reference to Girls Gone Wild, clearly.

98
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:37,180
Mm-hmm.

99
00:05:37,180 --> 00:05:40,260
Dustin Diamond, is that his real name?

100
00:05:40,260 --> 00:05:42,100
That is probably a stage name.

101
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:43,100
Unless it's not.

102
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:44,100
No, I don't think so.

103
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:45,100
I think it's real.

104
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:50,140
Yeah, Diamond is such an awesome stage name to pick in the early 90s.

105
00:05:50,140 --> 00:05:53,940
His name is Dustin Neil Diamond.

106
00:05:53,940 --> 00:05:58,300
No way, dude.

107
00:05:58,300 --> 00:05:59,300

00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:41,260
And then I just went in my apartment.

165
00:10:41,260 --> 00:10:43,580
But I got pretty close to kinda stepping in there

166
00:10:43,580 --> 00:10:44,420
and going Batman.

167
00:10:44,420 --> 00:10:45,820
- You almost did it, you almost threw a ninja star.

168
00:10:45,820 --> 00:10:47,380
- Yeah, I almost, yeah.

169
00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:50,080
But you know, I don't know what it is about this city

170
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:51,600
that just like, if you're from here,

171
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:53,260
you're just a complete psychopath.

172
00:10:53,260 --> 00:10:54,100
- Yeah, oh absolutely.

173
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:55,420
- Like just every, I think it's because you--

174
00:10:55,420 --> 00:10:58,700
- It's the water, it's what makes the bagels so good.

175
00:10:58,700 --> 00:10:59,540
- Exactly.

176
00:10:59,540 --> 00:11:03,860
I think it's because you are raised in a place

177
00:11:03,860 --> 00:11:07,740
where you walk outside and you always have an audience.

178
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:08,580
- That's true.

179
00:11:08,580 --> 00:11:10,340
- There's always people watching you.

180
00:11:10,340 --> 00:11:11,180
- Right.

181
00:11:11,180 --> 00:11:13,340
- And so this guy, and that's the worst part about this,

182
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:16,060
what happened with this guy knocking over the plants.

183
00:11:16,060 --> 00:11:18,400
It just ruined these very expensive plants.

184
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:20,620
It's a tragedy.

185
00:11:20,620 --> 00:11:23,180
And he definitely wasn't gonna do it

186
00:11:23,180 --> 00:11:25,740
until he looked at me, made eye contact with me,

187
00:11:25,740 --> 00:11:28,140
and I was smiling because I thought it was funny.

188
00:11:28,140 --> 00:11:29,860
He was yelling at this lady.

189
00:11:29,860 --> 00:11:31,060
I could see in his head, he was like,

190
00:11:31,060 --> 00:11:31,900
"I'm gonna turn this up.

191
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:33,560
"I'm gonna knock this shit.

192
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:39,560
I'm gonna break something. It's like a little kid. You enabled him. He definitely wasn't old. He was probably like...

193
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:42,800
You poked the bear. You poked the bear by doing that.

194
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:48,280
It's like when like a little kid like walks up to their parent and like kicks them in the shin and the other parent like

195
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:52,360
Laughs a little bit, so then the kid just like starts attacking. You know what I mean?

196
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:57,560
Yeah, it's exactly like what kids do. Like if you if you laugh or smile at one thing a kid does they

197
00:11:57,560 --> 00:12:02,160
They just keep doing it. They'll do it like times a hundred. Oh, yeah

198
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:05,920
I'm gonna hit you with the car next.

199
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:08,120
He had a Cristiano Ronaldo jersey on.

200
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:10,680
Dude, I think that might have been Cristiano Ronaldo.

201
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:12,760
Dude, I think it was Ronaldo.

202
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:15,800
It might have been, and that's the worst thing that guy ever did.

203
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:18,280
Is he the one... wait, what did he do?

204
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:19,280
He played soccer.

205
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:20,280
Oh, no, really?

206
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:21,280
Yeah, one of the...

207
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:27,160
I don't want to say greatest of all time, but...

208
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:29,880
He was also really into soccer.

209
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:31,920
He's a legend in two games.

210
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:33,760
Like Pee-wee Kirkland.

211
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:34,760
Pee-wee Kirkland?

212
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:35,760
Yeah.

213
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:42,600
Who's the, who's the fuckin', who's the soccer player that used to just like shave

214
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:47,500
like all of his head except for like one patch of hair right here?

215
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:51,880
Like he would have like, it was like his hairline and he would just shave like everything but

216
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:52,880
like a triangle?

217
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:53,880
I don't know.

218
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:55,220
I don't know anything about soccer.

219
00:12:55,220 --> 00:12:56,220
All I know is that Cristiano Ronaldo.

220
00:12:56,220 --> 00:12:57,600
I only know about that haircut.

221
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:00,640
I remember there was a soccer player who was biting people.

222
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:03,660
That's the extent of all I know about soccer.

223
00:13:03,660 --> 00:13:10,600
In Brazil, they cut a ref into pieces or something, or they beheaded him.

224
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:11,600
Really?

225
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:12,600
Yeah.

226
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:13,600
Yeah, dude.

227
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:14,600
I think there's video of it.

228
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:18,200
I think it was an early LiveLeague video in the 2000s.

229
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:23,760
It wasn't a high-level soccer game.

230
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:24,760
That makes it even better.

231
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:25,760
It wasn't even...

232
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:31,480
game and oh oh this is why they beheaded him I'm remembering this now he got this

233
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:36,040
ref the I wish American sports were like this this ref got into an argument with

234
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:46,520
one of the players and then the ref stabbed the player oh and then the

235
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:51,840
player got the player got evac taken to a hospital and then somebody called and

236
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:56,000
person, somebody called like the announcer for the game and the guy on the

237
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:03,000
announcer on the the like intercom thing said that he was like hey that

238
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:07,680
guy that the ref stabbed he just died at the hospital and so then just

239
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:12,520
everybody in the stands just like picked up the ref and beheaded him and cut him

240
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:26,160
in a piece of fuck that's what football should be yeah yeah like stop putting

241
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:30,080
stop like trying to add a pillow on top yeah well you know you know why they

242
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:33,480
don't admitted to that and you're willing to make to risk your life to

243
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:37,880
make a hundred million dollars a year or whatever the refs should be evil

244
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:42,280
everyone should be carrying weapons you should have an evil ref there should be

245
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:47,320
no guns allowed but if you can get medieval weapons and known yeah a mace

246
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:52,240
yeah have a place should every each team on the like in a gel should have a

247
00:14:52,240 --> 00:15:01,860
trebuchet where they can once a game you can launch one like a player yeah no they

248
00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:05,880
can launch him into the end zone it's like playing paper football with your

249
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:11,120
with your thumbs yeah yeah and they they should let you're allowed you can players

250
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:16,160
do HGH but I realized that they wouldn't let them do that because of how big your

251
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:20,480
fucking head gets when you do HGH yeah you get a bit yeah what they're they do

252
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:25,480
not have the materials nor the money to make helmets that big but also actually I

253
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:29,960
think you having a bigger head it might protect you more from CTE yeah it might

254
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:35,440
be a good idea to create like a super soldier Funko pop like species of

255
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:39,340
football players who don't even need pads and they just hit each other with their

256
00:15:39,340 --> 00:15:42,660
heads like the fucking like they're giraffes yeah

257
00:15:42,660 --> 00:15:49,820
Pachycephalosaurus yeah we got some Pachycephalosaurus DNA

258
00:15:49,820 --> 00:15:51,820
That's what the Packers are named after.

259
00:15:51,820 --> 00:15:53,820
The Pachycephalosaurus.

260
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:55,820
That's why they're called the Packers.

261
00:15:55,820 --> 00:16:03,020
I think yeah if you added like if if if you added if football in America was like was

262
00:16:03,020 --> 00:16:05,340
like the Mario soccer games.

263
00:16:05,340 --> 00:16:06,340
Yeah.

264
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:09,900
And like you could use a special ability and there was like a guy running around, there

265
00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:11,620
was like a dinosaur.

266
00:16:11,620 --> 00:16:12,620
And you could have Bowser.

267
00:16:12,620 --> 00:16:13,620
An evil dinosaur.

268
00:16:13,620 --> 00:16:14,620
Yeah.

269
00:16:14,620 --> 00:16:19,700
Yeah, an evil turtle, dinosaur guy, and also an old, old man with a mushroom for a head.

270
00:16:19,700 --> 00:16:21,860
I think it'd be better.

271
00:16:21,860 --> 00:16:26,100
Yeah, we should make it so that the football is a bomb.

272
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:31,260
Also once a game, again, you should just get special abilities that you charge up.

273
00:16:31,260 --> 00:16:32,260
Each team gets a sniper.

274
00:16:32,260 --> 00:16:37,260
uh-huh each team gets a sniper that sits on their side of the field.

275
00:16:37,260 --> 00:16:39,260
Yeah some guy with a Barrett .50 cal, they're already there.

276
00:16:39,260 --> 00:16:41,260
They already have snipers on them.

277
00:16:41,260 --> 00:16:45,260
A Barrett .50 cal, if you do some modifications, you could put a football on that thing.

278
00:16:45,260 --> 00:16:46,260
I agree.

279
00:16:46,260 --> 00:16:49,260
You could put a football on that thing and launch it across the field.

280
00:16:49,260 --> 00:16:51,260
Yeah, if Tom Brady deflated it enough.

281
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:53,260
Oh, man.

282
00:16:53,260 --> 00:16:55,260
Hey, you talking about my fucking boy dude.

283
00:16:55,260 --> 00:16:57,260
Hey, what the fuck?

284
00:16:57,260 --> 00:16:59,260
He moved to, he's playing for the...

285
00:16:59,260 --> 00:17:01,740
He's still number one in my fucking heart.

286
00:17:01,740 --> 00:17:03,340
(laughing)

287
00:17:03,340 --> 00:17:06,700
Okay, Thumper, he's still number one in my fucking heart.

288
00:17:06,700 --> 00:17:08,220
- I wish you were a real Boston guy.

289
00:17:08,220 --> 00:17:10,820
I wish you were into the Red Sox and shit.

290
00:17:10,820 --> 00:17:12,940
- I wish, my brother is.

291
00:17:12,940 --> 00:17:14,140
I wish I fucking understood.

292
00:17:14,140 --> 00:17:14,980
- You're a poser, dude.

293
00:17:14,980 --> 00:17:15,980
You're not a Boston guy.

294
00:17:15,980 --> 00:17:17,420
- I am a Boston boy.

295
00:17:17,420 --> 00:17:18,820
I'm Boston Irish, bitch.

296
00:17:18,820 --> 00:17:19,780
- No, you're not.

297
00:17:19,780 --> 00:17:21,280
Cam likes hockey, at least.

298
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:22,120
- Yeah, I like hockey.

299
00:17:22,120 --> 00:17:23,460
- I like hockey 'cause they fight,

300
00:17:23,460 --> 00:17:25,300
but I couldn't get into hockey in high school

301
00:17:25,300 --> 00:17:26,140
because of my brothers.

302
00:17:26,140 --> 00:17:27,400
- Yeah, you're not a real Boston boy.

303
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:28,240
That's what I'm saying.

304
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:33,360
I've only been to one hockey game, it was a California Condors game in

305
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:39,600
Bakersfield, California when I was a kid and I went with my grandpa, my very sweet

306
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:44,800
old older grandpa who older my grandpa's older than me.

307
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:50,800
My older grandpa.

308
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:56,800
My younger grandpa.

309
00:17:56,800 --> 00:18:01,040
my grandpa are the same age, so it's really cool. We're into a lot of the same shit.

310
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:06,800
But he took me to this thing and he's such like a sweet old man that we, a fight

311
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:13,580
broke out and he was like, "We have to, we have to leave." And we just left during like the

312
00:18:13,580 --> 00:18:18,580
only cool part of a hockey game. Dude, I went to a couple charity games as a

313
00:18:18,580 --> 00:18:22,200
kid, like my mom got like free tickets and like my dad was trying to get me

314
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:26,200
into hockey so bad when I was a kid. Yeah. Like my dad bought us skates and then

315
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:29,320
And I was like, "Dad, I don't want to play hockey.

316
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:31,040
I want to play action figures."

317
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:32,560
I want to play games in the backyard.

318
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:35,040
Yeah, I want to play Star Wars in the backyard.

319
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:37,000
I don't want to play hockey.

320
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:42,520
And so they took us to a couple charity games and it was for childhood cancer.

321
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:50,760
And it was like, "Oh, we've got Boston Bruins legends playing some fucking farm league team."

322
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:52,920
And the whole time I was trying to...

323
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:53,920
They were farm league.

324
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:54,920
They were cows.

325
00:18:54,920 --> 00:19:01,160
like a fight going when I was like six. At a charity game? At a charity game. Dude, that,

326
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:04,560
because imagine, that would be fucking sick. It would be so sick. If somebody gets put in

327
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:09,280
the goddamn penalty box for a fight at a charity game. That's like, there was a, there was a

328
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:14,960
hardcore festival in North Carolina that, it happened two years, and it was a benefit

329
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:20,400
for this girl's family who died of cancer. And the first year it was fine, they raised

330
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:25,800
a lot of money. Second year of this fucking charity thing, there was like a shooting at

331
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:34,800
the charity show. And it's like, come on, go to a school or something. Don't do this

332
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:37,840
here. We're all trying to have a good time.

333
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:38,840
That's so crazy.

334
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:42,080
Yeah, man. It's epic, dude.

335
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:45,800
I've had this open and it's been staring at me this whole fucking time.

336
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:47,800
What, your past asshole?

337
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:54,400
I'm still looking yeah. Hey buddy that's a mirror. We got him a new little thing.

338
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:58,600
We got him a human asshole installed. We got him a human asshole so he could take human shits.

339
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:03,480
Just like a big pink asshole and like a little bit of white, a white guy skin

340
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:08,600
around it where they cut. They had to cut a circle they couldn't cut the star shape out.

341
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:12,680
They yeah well I mean we're trying to we're gonna make him poop in the toilet.

342
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:15,720
So we're gonna make him a human. We're gonna make the cat a human slowly.

343
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:20,920
But I've Dustin diamond to fight bagel boss Chris Morgan and boxing match

344
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:31,320
Now I'm just thinking about if you replaced slowly every part of a cat with human stuff

345
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:37,760
You could make him a guy. Yeah. Yeah, you just couldn't do it. I mean, that's literally that's just mew -

346
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:43,640
That's true. That's true or that fucking from Dragon Ball. What's his name?

347
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:45,440
Beerus is that his name?

348
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:45,940
Goku.

349
00:20:45,940 --> 00:20:48,340
His name is Mewtwo 2.

350
00:20:48,340 --> 00:20:53,840
Beerus, yeah, Beerus is literally, uh, is literally the fucker if you replace parts of him with a guy.

351
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:56,640
That's true. Yeah. Yeah, Beerus is a fucker.

352
00:20:56,640 --> 00:21:00,180
How, I mean, how many, at what point is he in just a guy?

353
00:21:00,180 --> 00:21:01,180
If you replace...

354
00:21:01,180 --> 00:21:04,460
Yeah, I feel like you could get just, just imagine his like little...

355
00:21:04,460 --> 00:21:10,160
His little neck on top of like a human body like, uh, the Goombas in the Super Mario Brothers movie.

356
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:11,420
With John Leguizamo.

357
00:21:11,420 --> 00:21:12,260
Yeah.

358
00:21:13,140 --> 00:21:15,140
I feel like that'd be a good, a cool look.

359
00:21:15,140 --> 00:21:16,460
He would look very cool.

360
00:21:16,460 --> 00:21:19,460
I honestly, sometimes I wish he was like that.

361
00:21:19,460 --> 00:21:20,460
But like a tiny, a tiny guy.

362
00:21:20,460 --> 00:21:24,100
You're gonna send him off to college and he's gonna come back looking like that.

363
00:21:24,100 --> 00:21:26,100
Patrick wishes he had a pet human.

364
00:21:26,100 --> 00:21:27,100
No.

365
00:21:27,100 --> 00:21:28,100
Is what he just said.

366
00:21:28,100 --> 00:21:30,780
I wish that my pet was a guy.

367
00:21:30,780 --> 00:21:32,180
You wish you had a pet guy?

368
00:21:32,180 --> 00:21:33,180
No.

369
00:21:33,180 --> 00:21:34,180
Yeah, you do.

370
00:21:34,180 --> 00:21:35,180
Yeah, you do.

371
00:21:35,180 --> 00:21:36,180
You just said you did.

372
00:21:36,180 --> 00:21:39,180
You wanna do diabolical experiments on your...

373
00:21:39,180 --> 00:21:43,420
I wish that my pet was a guy so he could pick up his own poop.

374
00:21:43,420 --> 00:21:44,860
With his hands and feed it to you.

375
00:21:44,860 --> 00:21:45,860
Yeah.

376
00:21:45,860 --> 00:21:46,860
I don't want him to feed it to me, I just want him to throw it away.

377
00:21:46,860 --> 00:21:47,860
You do.

378
00:21:47,860 --> 00:21:51,220
You don't want him to feed it to you, but you want him to poke it up and plate it.

379
00:21:51,220 --> 00:21:54,420
You want my cat to poop on you.

380
00:21:54,420 --> 00:21:55,420
And you do.

381
00:21:55,420 --> 00:21:56,420
Not on you.

382
00:21:56,420 --> 00:21:57,420
And you want him to stink it up.

383
00:21:57,420 --> 00:21:58,820

00:21:58,820 --> 00:21:59,820

00:22:41,260 --> 00:22:45,480
if he was doing a bit where he said like don't see the movie they said that I'm

417
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:49,420
an executive producer or some type of thing where I'm not I'd have to look it

418
00:22:49,420 --> 00:22:56,540
up but it's like it's a very weird video I don't care he was raised in the Baha

419
00:22:56,540 --> 00:23:06,300
I faith yeah I do know he's behind Baha blast faith yeah behind blast yeah which

420
00:23:06,300 --> 00:23:09,900
is basically as far as I can tell it's just basically like Christianity or

421
00:23:09,900 --> 00:23:14,860
Islam. It's literally it's like they think that they think that every

422
00:23:14,860 --> 00:23:17,940
version of God is like just a different version of their one God so it's

423
00:23:17,940 --> 00:23:22,140
literally just like they're like oh you know what actually we're better than all

424
00:23:22,140 --> 00:23:25,860
of you guys like we're gonna take all of your shit it's actually all about us.

425
00:23:25,860 --> 00:23:30,540
I think it is like a new one right? I'm pretty sure it is. But it is like it's

426
00:23:30,540 --> 00:23:35,540
like part like Islam part Christianity part Judaism it's one of those ones

427
00:23:35,540 --> 00:23:42,080
where they're like Jesus was a prophet Jesus was a very good man yeah no say

428
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:45,400
he's the but say he was the best say he was the best right now say he could beat

00:23:55,960 --> 00:23:59,600

00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:07,720
Dwight. Thunder. Thunder Dwight. Thunder Dwight. Yeah, no, it's a very weird video. It's him

433
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:12,260
in his house and he's like, "This movie's a fraud. They said that I'm a producer."

434
00:24:12,260 --> 00:24:17,660
Wait, an LPC in his house? No, no, Rainn Wilson denouncing the Longbottom Potion Castle movie

435
00:24:17,660 --> 00:24:21,940
that's coming out soon. Are they making a movie? Yeah, they were making a documentary

436
00:24:21,940 --> 00:24:28,140
about him yeah but I don't I don't know I don't know if he's like pretending to

437
00:24:28,140 --> 00:24:34,020
not do it and then like to drum up hype for it or I don't know what the hell's

438
00:24:34,020 --> 00:24:38,560
going on I don't know but I all I know is he's a certified weirdo he's a

439
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:42,060
certified freak yeah he's definitely weird to his core

440
00:24:42,060 --> 00:24:46,260
Ray Nelson you're a certified freak and I know that cuz you played a creep on

441
00:24:46,260 --> 00:24:53,860
the office as Dwight. Yeah. You're a creep. You're a creep, Red Wilson. What is up with

442
00:24:53,860 --> 00:24:59,900
Creed? I mean, I've been watching The Office and he's giving me the heebie-jeebies. He's

443
00:24:59,900 --> 00:25:06,780
such a freaky old man. Just get him some headphones. Diaper! Get him a diaper! This guy's name

444
00:25:06,780 --> 00:25:11,580
should be Creep. He's old! I'm thinking this guy's name should be Creep. Headphones are

445
00:25:11,580 --> 00:25:13,580
I'm thinking this guy's name should be Creep.

446
00:25:13,580 --> 00:25:15,580
Yeah, no just...

447
00:25:15,580 --> 00:25:17,580
Can you laugh at it?

448
00:25:17,580 --> 00:25:19,580
Can you laugh at it?

449
00:25:19,580 --> 00:25:21,580
I'm thinking his name should be Creep.

450
00:25:21,580 --> 00:25:23,580
Can you laugh at it though?

451
00:25:23,580 --> 00:25:25,580
I'm thinking cause I'm a creep

452
00:25:25,580 --> 00:25:27,580
I'm thinking that creeps the office

453
00:25:27,580 --> 00:25:29,580
office

454
00:25:29,580 --> 00:25:31,580
and I'm with Jim and Pam

455
00:25:31,580 --> 00:25:33,580
selling paper

456
00:25:33,580 --> 00:25:35,580
I'm thinking that is

457
00:25:35,580 --> 00:25:37,580
I don't wanna go to work

458
00:25:37,580 --> 00:25:39,580
I just wanna watch

459
00:25:39,580 --> 00:25:46,060
song parody by Taka. Come on I worked on this. I just want to look at Pam's things I just

460
00:25:46,060 --> 00:25:54,460
want to play with Michael but I'm a creed and I work here. I'm a creed. What the hell is

461
00:25:54,460 --> 00:26:02,660
Stanley's name? Where did Dwight go? I'm thinking this guy's name should be creep based on the

462
00:26:02,660 --> 00:26:08,500
song that's being sang about him. That's probably a good idea. Do you guys want to look at our

463
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:11,340
list you know look let's take a list that

464
00:26:11,340 --> 00:26:14,100

465
00:26:14,100 --> 00:26:16,380

466
00:26:16,380 --> 00:26:19,100
Harry Potter RP server again oh yeah mod

00:26:23,860 --> 00:26:25,900
calling people pedophiles and there was

470
00:26:25,900 --> 00:26:28,420
one guy who was a is was his name Chris

471
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:30,100

476
00:26:36,620 --> 00:26:41,340
spell that put a rope on Patrick and dragged him across the entire map.

477
00:26:41,340 --> 00:26:44,140
He dragged me to the Quidditch pitch. That's the most insane thing I've ever seen.

478
00:26:44,140 --> 00:26:47,660
That's how you prove that you're not a pedophile. You cast a spell.

479
00:26:47,660 --> 00:26:55,920
So what I did was I went into... I was on... you're on a schedule in Harry Potter RP

480
00:26:55,920 --> 00:27:01,220
and I went into my class that all the Slytherins were supposed to take because

481
00:27:01,220 --> 00:27:08,580
I'm a Slytherin and... He's a filthy Slytherin. Do you have to choose? No, you get sorted. Oh my god.

482
00:27:08,580 --> 00:27:14,100
Do you take a test? No, you click on the... you press E on the sorting hat. That is

483
00:27:14,100 --> 00:27:20,900
fascism. Yep. Yeah. So... They do have a special thanks to Million Dollar Extreme. Yeah, they do.

484
00:27:20,900 --> 00:27:29,860
They do have a... like each of them by name in detention. Oh my god, that's so funny. But I went in, I said I was the

485
00:27:29,860 --> 00:27:35,540
teaching assistant and I said that I was like okay class it was herbology or

486
00:27:35,540 --> 00:27:40,340
something like that no no it was like muggles studies I thought it was

487
00:27:40,340 --> 00:27:44,620
potions class potions that's what it fucking was but I walked in and I said

488
00:27:44,620 --> 00:27:48,580
like there have been some again Dumbledore was following me around

489
00:27:48,580 --> 00:27:52,660
because he was trying to see if I was griefing to send me to detention so I

490
00:27:52,660 --> 00:27:56,100
kept every time that he left the room I would go up to the front of the classroom

491
00:27:56,100 --> 00:27:59,540
and be like there have been some allegations levied against Dumbledore

492
00:27:59,540 --> 00:28:05,620
and and Dumbledore kept coming back into the room in the middle of Patrick saying

read the really long one. All right yeah this is a really long comment. You know

532
00:31:04,820 --> 00:31:09,340
what I am the older brother of our family and my brother well he is the

533
00:31:09,340 --> 00:31:13,500
most annoying person in my whole life. He always care about himself, his gaming

534
00:31:13,500 --> 00:31:17,780
addiction, and his worst obsession on some of his favorites, e.g. TV shows,

535
00:31:17,780 --> 00:31:22,900
music, gaming, etc. Dude, I hate when my brother has favorites and their TV shows.

536
00:31:22,900 --> 00:31:25,340
-My brother's favorites? -Yeah, some of my favorites are TV shows,

537
00:31:25,340 --> 00:31:26,460
music, and gaming.

538
00:31:26,460 --> 00:31:28,460
-Some of your favorites will be implicated.

539
00:31:28,460 --> 00:31:35,620
-Even I almost killed Takeout, his favorites, for revenge, but believe me,

540
00:31:35,620 --> 00:31:39,420
it's hard to be a big brother for him because he also physically hurt me

541
00:31:39,420 --> 00:31:42,220
which I don't really care about because he think I am a monster than a

542
00:31:42,220 --> 00:31:44,520
brother even I am doing rights for him.

543
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:48,720
He also sings with the worst voice in the world much worse than Justin

544
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:49,220
Bieber.

545
00:31:49,220 --> 00:31:53,220
His voice was irritating that he can't refused to stop my parents won't

546
00:31:53,220 --> 00:31:55,620
even let me hurt him because of his rude ways.

547
00:31:55,620 --> 00:31:59,220
I didn't hurt.

548
00:31:59,220 --> 00:32:02,620
I didn't hurt him because I was a kind person, you know, my brother.

549
00:32:02,620 --> 00:32:03,720
He is not nice.

550
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:07,060
he was very naive and very rude person that he cannot change

551
00:32:07,060 --> 00:32:10,740
maybe his friends take him some stupid things to him so he will going to annoy

552
00:32:10,740 --> 00:32:11,360
me

553
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:15,380
he have no motivation whatsoever to bug me out and making such excuse that my

554
00:32:15,380 --> 00:32:16,840
parents will believe me

555
00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:17,960
he even quote

556
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:18,700
touch

557
00:32:18,700 --> 00:32:23,680
my stuff and he gets a hold of my music playlist uh... five-year i won't forget

558
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:27,160
what he did and what he say to me why do i ever have a brother in the first

559
00:32:27,160 --> 00:32:30,320
place he ruined it my whole life partially

560
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:34,920
He ruined my whole life partially.

561
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:38,000
The scare quotes touch really is making me uncomfortable.

562
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,680
Yeah, touch my stuff.

563
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:41,560
That might be like an Adam Savage thing.

564
00:32:41,560 --> 00:32:44,240
I don't like that at all.

565
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:45,760
That's upsetting.

566
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:47,240
He ruined my whole life partially.

567
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:48,240
Partially, yeah.

568
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:49,240
That's such a good end.

569
00:32:49,240 --> 00:32:54,480
So basically, your honor, my ex-wife in conclusion, she had ruined my whole life.

570
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:55,480
Partially.

571
00:32:55,480 --> 00:32:56,480
Partially.

572
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:57,480
Partially speaking.

573
00:32:57,480 --> 00:33:00,160
Which is why I think I'm entitled to the Xbox.

574
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:02,560
My parents won't even let me hurt him

575
00:33:02,560 --> 00:33:04,360
because of his rude ways.

576
00:33:04,360 --> 00:33:06,040
- Mom, I want to hate him.

577
00:33:06,040 --> 00:33:07,600
- Let me hurt him. - Because of his rude ways.

578
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:08,960
You're not allowed to.

579
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:11,000
He sings worse than Justin Bieber.

580
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:11,840
- Mom.

581
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:13,140
- Mom, can I hurt my brother?

582
00:33:13,140 --> 00:33:14,280
- Well, why do you want to hurt him?

583
00:33:14,280 --> 00:33:15,960
- Because of his rude ways.

584
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:17,640
- No, absolutely not.

585
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:20,800
- I need to hurt my brother due to his rude ways.

586
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:23,120
- He think I am a monster than a brother.

587
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:24,960
- My favorite syntax is like a kid

588
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:26,800
trying to type like an adult.

589
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:27,640
- Yeah. - Yeah.

590
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:28,480
- You know what I mean?

591
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:34,800
like just every every part of it like using using words like physically yeah

592
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:39,280
it's like he was like I'm gonna be I'm making a case right now and the cops

593
00:33:39,280 --> 00:33:42,160
are gonna read this and then arrest my brother for ruined did my whole life

594
00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:46,200
part is what do you guys think he means by even I almost killed take out his

595
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:53,720
favorites for revenge what do you guys mean we think he meant by he is not nice

596
00:33:53,720 --> 00:33:58,600
I don't know. I think it might mean that he sings with a much worse than

597
00:33:58,600 --> 00:34:02,320
Justin Bieber. That's pretty nice. He does sing much worse than Justin Bieber.

598
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:05,760
You know what this reminds me of? Do you remember that Vine that was like

599
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:09,840
the girl is like, "If you think that parents need to stop acting like our

600
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:16,160
teachers, subscribe in the comments down below and I will call the cops."

601
00:34:16,160 --> 00:34:23,160
That's what that reminds me of. I think I'm very, this makes me happy because I'm

602
00:34:23,160 --> 00:34:29,800
glad that kids like a like middle school kids still hate Justin Bieber yeah yeah

603
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:35,200
like that is it is amazing to me that that has that's like persisted that just

604
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:40,600
like we were there in like 2010 you know just saved it on one of those like one

605
00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:44,800
of those things or no like this is a really old thing well it doesn't have a

606
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:48,640
date for when all these were posted so we could just be reading like stuff from

607
00:34:48,640 --> 00:34:51,680
when we were like I realized that the other day we could just be reading like

608
00:34:51,680 --> 00:34:56,960
stuff from when we were in middle school. Did you guys ever do that thing where

609
00:34:56,960 --> 00:35:01,720
it's like you schedule an email to be sent to you like five years from now?

610
00:35:01,720 --> 00:35:07,720
No. I did that when I was like like 13 or something and then I just obviously

611
00:35:07,720 --> 00:35:12,360
forgot about it and then I got it when I was 18 a couple years ago and it just

612
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:19,080
said fuck you and I scheduled that for five years. That's so awesome. Yeah cuz

613
00:35:19,080 --> 00:35:25,880
you're supposed to be like dear older me I hate my chores and I love yeah yeah and

614
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:30,600
I was just like I've done I've done stuff like that for myself before like my one

615
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:33,800

619
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:56,640
until like recently when I did security questions for something I would just

620
00:35:56,640 --> 00:36:01,480

Next to me and Fifi, my doggie.

658

00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:28,240

661
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:33,800
- When my dad is sane and playful, that's awesome.

662
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:34,920

The only sane and playful.

665
00:39:40,760 --> 00:39:43,800
My dad is good, but he has a horrible temper.

666
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:44,680
And when he's angry enough,

667
00:39:44,680 --> 00:39:46,320
he will not only scream the house down,

668
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:49,240
he will also throw a temper tantrum fit for a two year old.

669
00:39:49,240 --> 00:39:51,120
(laughs)

670
00:39:51,120 --> 00:39:54,200
Dad, you're acting like a two year old right now to my mom.

Ugh.

676
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:04,720
Before my dad died, he used to annoy the crap out of me

677
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:06,680
by making references to stuff I hated,

678
00:40:06,680 --> 00:40:08,880
but that doesn't mean I disliked him.

679
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:12,120
My dad is sometimes so stupid, bitchy, and dumb ass man.

680
00:40:12,120 --> 00:40:15,040
Because he is grumpy, annoying, and prim person, arg.

00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:17,320
Prim person?

00:42:42,900 --> 00:42:43,740
Never learned that.

721
00:42:43,740 --> 00:42:44,580
- I never had a stepmom.

722
00:42:44,580 --> 00:42:46,240
- I haven't had one yet.

723
00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:48,240
- Guys don't remarry, dude.

724
00:42:48,240 --> 00:42:49,480
I got my fingers crossed.

725
00:42:49,480 --> 00:42:50,320
- Yeah, they just, they--

726
00:42:50,320 --> 00:42:52,400
- Unless you're rich, guys don't remarry.

727
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:53,480
- It's true.

728
00:42:53,480 --> 00:42:54,320
- Yeah.

729
00:42:54,320 --> 00:42:56,120

00:42:56,120 --> 00:42:56,960

731
00:42:56,960 --> 00:42:58,960
- Rich guys love to remarry a girl that's like--

732
00:42:58,960 --> 00:42:59,800
- Normal guys--

733
00:42:59,800 --> 00:43:01,040
- The same age as their daughter.

734
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:01,880
- Hate to remarry.

735
00:43:01,880 --> 00:43:02,700
- Which is pimp.

736
00:43:02,700 --> 00:43:04,160
- Which is pimp as hell.

737
00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:05,200
- I think so.

738
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:06,380
- I don't think so.

739
00:43:06,380 --> 00:43:11,520
I think you need, if you remarry, you have to marry someone older than you because it's

740
00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:13,780
leveling up.

741
00:43:13,780 --> 00:43:15,100
You can't go prestige.

742
00:43:15,100 --> 00:43:16,100
You can't go prestige.

743
00:43:16,100 --> 00:43:17,100
You gotta keep leveling up.

744
00:43:17,100 --> 00:43:21,180
True, you can't, yeah, you can't, that's what, that is what the divorced rich dad does.

745
00:43:21,180 --> 00:43:24,020
He prestiges back to an 18 year old wife.

746
00:43:24,020 --> 00:43:25,020
Yeah, exactly.

747
00:43:25,020 --> 00:43:27,860
And he drives her around in a Mazda Miata.

748
00:43:27,860 --> 00:43:31,060
Yeah, yeah, or like a Lotus.

749
00:43:31,060 --> 00:43:33,740
A Lotus is a rich dad car.

750
00:43:33,740 --> 00:43:34,820
What's a Lotus?

751
00:43:34,820 --> 00:43:35,660
It's a car.

752
00:43:35,660 --> 00:43:39,340
It's a beautiful flower. It's a lotus car.

753
00:43:39,340 --> 00:43:40,620
You'll see lotus cars. It's a beautiful flower

754
00:43:40,620 --> 00:43:41,620
that represents the seven chakras.

755
00:43:41,620 --> 00:43:43,340
Oh, okay, okay.

756
00:43:43,340 --> 00:43:44,180
Yeah, that's a good divorce guy car.

757
00:43:44,180 --> 00:43:48,140
You know, an extreme divorce guy car

758
00:43:48,140 --> 00:43:50,500
is the Polaris Slingshot.

759
00:43:50,500 --> 00:43:51,340
For sure.

760
00:43:51,340 --> 00:43:54,300
No, the Polaris Slingshot is a marriage saving car.

761
00:43:54,300 --> 00:43:57,820
Yeah, that's a last ditch effort.

762
00:43:57,820 --> 00:44:00,820
You buy the Polaris Slingshot in a last ditch effort

763
00:44:00,820 --> 00:44:02,020
to save your marriage,

764
00:44:02,020 --> 00:44:06,100
And you, and then your dad drives around in it

765
00:44:06,100 --> 00:44:09,980
and he's completely bald and he's got on very, very good--

766
00:44:09,980 --> 00:44:10,820
- I saw a--

767
00:44:10,820 --> 00:44:13,540
- He's got a very good pair of true religion jeans on

768
00:44:13,540 --> 00:44:14,980
and those really weird loafers

769
00:44:14,980 --> 00:44:16,980
that are like squared off at the end.

770
00:44:16,980 --> 00:44:18,780
And he pulls up to the courthouse

771
00:44:18,780 --> 00:44:20,520
playing Billy Eilish bad guy.

772
00:44:20,520 --> 00:44:22,540
(laughing)

773
00:44:22,540 --> 00:44:25,140
And he takes off his sunglasses and flips off your mom.

774
00:44:25,140 --> 00:44:28,060
- Yeah, and he forgets there's no door on it for a second

775
00:44:28,060 --> 00:44:29,220
and tries to open it.

776
00:44:29,220 --> 00:44:31,060
(laughing)

777
00:44:31,060 --> 00:44:33,300
He just mimes opening a door and gets out.

778
00:44:33,300 --> 00:44:37,660
Yeah, and he's like, "Try and take my money now, bitch.

779
00:44:37,660 --> 00:44:39,460
It's in this car."

780
00:44:39,460 --> 00:44:42,940
Your dad installs butterfly doors on a Polaris slingshot.

781
00:44:42,940 --> 00:44:46,060
Yeah, butterfly doors from like an Acura.

782
00:44:46,060 --> 00:44:54,140
Yeah, a dad who gets divorced and then drives around in a Brink armored truck and keeps all

783
00:44:54,140 --> 00:44:56,100
of his belongings in it.

784
00:44:56,100 --> 00:44:59,540
Yeah, you're not getting half.

785
00:44:59,540 --> 00:45:03,660
I put I put an ink cartridge on my Steely Dan records. Yeah

786
00:45:03,660 --> 00:45:09,480
As soon as you leave the apartment, it's gonna explode all over and everybody's gonna know. Yeah, I put those

787
00:45:09,480 --> 00:45:17,000
Those those target anti shoplift like beeping things on to all my children and the dog

788
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:23,620
Yeah, I put a shotgun in a tripwire above the above the doorway of the man cave

789
00:45:23,620 --> 00:45:28,460
So if you walk in and try to steal stuff, it's gonna be like the end of saw there's claymore at the foot of

790
00:45:28,980 --> 00:45:30,220
- Yeah, I play.

791
00:45:30,220 --> 00:45:32,460
(laughing)

792
00:45:32,460 --> 00:45:36,380
- All right, number three, your mom.

793
00:45:36,380 --> 00:45:37,220
- Yeah, your mom.

794
00:45:37,220 --> 00:45:38,060
You wanna try that?

795
00:45:38,060 --> 00:45:39,700
Hey, hey, you wanna try that again?

796
00:45:39,700 --> 00:45:41,460
- Yeah. - Your mom.

797
00:45:41,460 --> 00:45:42,300
- You know we straight. - Hey, you wanna try

798
00:45:42,300 --> 00:45:43,140

799
00:45:43,140 --> 00:45:45,620
Your mom. - Your mom.

800
00:45:45,620 --> 00:45:46,900
Your mom.

801
00:45:46,900 --> 00:45:48,460
- What if it's like doing your mom,

802
00:45:48,460 --> 00:45:51,020
but it's not doing your mom,

803
00:45:51,020 --> 00:45:54,220
it's just like he's like, your mom, your mom.

804
00:45:54,220 --> 00:45:57,140
- First comment, just a horrible person.

805
00:45:57,140 --> 00:45:59,380
(laughter)

806
00:45:59,380 --> 00:46:01,540
- This is a horrible person, can't wait to get away from her.

807
00:46:01,540 --> 00:46:03,420
She's superficial, selfish, always complaining

808
00:46:03,420 --> 00:46:04,260
about every single thing.

809
00:46:04,260 --> 00:46:07,420
Stuck up, boastful, illogical, just a major pain in the ass.

810
00:46:07,420 --> 00:46:10,560
- This kid is just leaving, like, this kid is like,

811
00:46:10,560 --> 00:46:12,920
just leaving their dirty laundry across the floor

812
00:46:12,920 --> 00:46:14,900
of every room in the house, just like,

813
00:46:14,900 --> 00:46:17,420
smearing shit on the walls.

814
00:46:17,420 --> 00:46:19,140
And the mom is like, "Can you not do that?"

815
00:46:19,140 --> 00:46:20,480
Wow, I can't wait to get away from you.

816
00:46:20,480 --> 00:46:22,740
You're so superficial, selfish, always complaining

817
00:46:22,740 --> 00:46:25,620
about every single thing.

818
00:46:25,620 --> 00:46:27,960
Let me pee in the aquarium, you controlling bitch.

819
00:46:27,960 --> 00:46:30,860
Let me pee in the aquarium and then eat the fish out of it.

820
00:46:30,860 --> 00:46:31,700
Yeah.

821
00:46:31,700 --> 00:46:35,480
She's the bitchiest person I have ever met.

822
00:46:35,480 --> 00:46:37,720
You are the bitchiest mom.

823
00:46:37,720 --> 00:46:39,800
She's the bitchiest person I've ever met.

824
00:46:39,800 --> 00:46:42,200
She is always complaining, gets mad over everything,

825
00:46:42,200 --> 00:46:44,740
and when she is mad, she slams every door she goes through.

826
00:46:44,740 --> 00:46:47,780
She sucks, F dash dash K her.

827
00:46:47,780 --> 00:46:48,840
Oh man.

828
00:46:48,840 --> 00:46:51,540
If your mom sees that, pal, you're busted.

829
00:46:51,540 --> 00:46:52,600
Here's a comment.

830
00:46:52,600 --> 00:46:54,360
Moms know what goes in those dashes

831
00:46:54,360 --> 00:46:55,360
and they're not gonna like it.

832
00:46:55,360 --> 00:46:56,680
- Yeah, no.

833
00:46:56,680 --> 00:46:57,520
- Mom's not--

834
00:46:57,520 --> 00:47:00,480
- Without your mom, you wouldn't be born from Epic Jake.

835
00:47:00,480 --> 00:47:03,240
- At times I have no problem with her,

836
00:47:03,240 --> 00:47:06,520
but when it comes to video games, dot, dot, dot.

837
00:47:06,520 --> 00:47:10,160
That's right. - Whoa.

838
00:47:10,160 --> 00:47:12,060
- Number four, stepmom.

839
00:47:12,060 --> 00:47:16,360
We got, oh, here we go.

840
00:47:16,360 --> 00:47:17,680
This is kind of a plan.

841
00:47:17,680 --> 00:47:23,240
This is a, okay, this is another sub list.

842
00:47:23,240 --> 00:47:27,360
This user says, oh yes, on my B-day,

843
00:47:27,360 --> 00:47:29,320
I plan to make my step-mom and dad

844
00:47:29,320 --> 00:47:31,720
split up on the spot in front of my friends.

845
00:47:31,720 --> 00:47:33,720
Hopefully it won't fail.

846
00:47:33,720 --> 00:47:36,000
My plan, here's a six step plan, okay?

847
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:37,040
- All right, I'm gonna write this down.

848
00:47:37,040 --> 00:47:39,620
- Number one, wait for everyone to come.

849
00:47:39,620 --> 00:47:43,260
Number two, deliberately do something

850
00:47:43,260 --> 00:47:45,320
that she'll tell me off for that is so ridiculous

851
00:47:45,320 --> 00:47:47,200
my dad will get seriously angry with her.

852
00:47:47,200 --> 00:47:49,060
Tell my dad that my step-mom told me off

853
00:47:49,060 --> 00:47:51,320
in front of my friends, this will cause an argument.

854
00:47:51,320 --> 00:47:52,720
That's kind of a big second step.

855
00:47:52,720 --> 00:47:55,680
that's a lot of stuff. That might as well be two. Or wait that is

856
00:47:55,680 --> 00:47:59,160
supposed to be three but because it just goes to four next and they just

857
00:47:59,160 --> 00:48:03,440
didn't write three. Okay four I'll act really sad and I'll run into the

858
00:48:03,440 --> 00:48:07,120
bathroom and make my eyes itchy so that they water. I'll say I've been crying.

859
00:48:07,120 --> 00:48:14,160
This is just like a sociopath. Five I'm going to make myself feel an emotion. Dad

860
00:48:14,160 --> 00:48:18,960
super sympathetic and will get mad at stepmom. Number six hopefully the plan

861
00:48:18,960 --> 00:48:24,180
would have worked I feel like we can come up with a better plan to get ready how

862
00:48:24,180 --> 00:48:30,300
do you get rid of your stepmom you guys you you have a dress up dress up like my

863
00:48:30,300 --> 00:48:35,180
my parents are happily married I dress up like a stepmom I don't have a step

864
00:48:35,180 --> 00:48:40,560
parent either of us could I have a stepdad but I on all of my plans have

865
00:48:40,560 --> 00:48:48,540
failed yeah I'm gonna pitch a plan to you all right okay staircase you

866
00:48:48,540 --> 00:48:53,140
you go into your stepdad's room okay you take his clothes you put it on you make

867
00:48:53,140 --> 00:48:57,300
a plaster cast of his head and face okay and you get like a latex mask that looks

868
00:48:57,300 --> 00:49:04,100
exactly like him and then you try to kill your mom okay I've got you kill

869
00:49:04,100 --> 00:49:09,020
your real mom - whoever he's your stepdad is married to your mom oh you stepdad

870
00:49:09,020 --> 00:49:23,380
okay I thought yeah yeah wait I guess that yeah if you're if you have a stepmom

871
00:49:23,380 --> 00:49:26,980
like if you have a stepdad and a mom and then your mom dies and your stepdad

872
00:49:26,980 --> 00:49:31,660
remarries you could have just two step parents I guess so yeah what if your

873
00:49:31,660 --> 00:49:38,940
stepmom marries your stepdad what if your dog marries your mom yeah what

874
00:49:38,940 --> 00:49:41,860
What if your cousin was your dog?

875
00:49:41,860 --> 00:49:44,300
What if the sky was purple?

876
00:49:44,300 --> 00:49:48,620
And you saw it purple but I saw it blue but we both think it's blue.

877
00:49:48,620 --> 00:49:50,420
That's pretty crazy to think about.

878
00:49:50,420 --> 00:49:51,420
Yeah.

879
00:49:51,420 --> 00:49:55,540
I've got a plan to get rid of your stepdad too.

880
00:49:55,540 --> 00:49:57,420
It's kind of like Cameron's plan.

881
00:49:57,420 --> 00:49:58,420
What is it?

882
00:49:58,420 --> 00:50:00,420
You kind of use the same first steps as Cameron's plan.

883
00:50:00,420 --> 00:50:01,420
Okay, copycat.

884
00:50:01,420 --> 00:50:02,420
Copycat alert.

885
00:50:02,420 --> 00:50:03,420
No, no, no.

886
00:50:03,420 --> 00:50:05,260
Let's make a plan to get rid of Patrick.

887
00:50:05,260 --> 00:50:07,900
I am not being a copycat because you're getting to let me finish.

888
00:50:07,900 --> 00:50:11,180
on with the plan then why are you being so defensive okay so you make a plaster

889
00:50:11,180 --> 00:50:15,580
cast you make a latex mold of your stepdad copycat so you go oh my god go

890
00:50:15,580 --> 00:50:22,740
no oh wait you go in this one completely different sorry uh-huh you go you go you

891
00:50:22,740 --> 00:50:29,260
go you go to Walmart and you show everyone your stinky little penis so it's

892
00:50:29,260 --> 00:50:33,100
just a little kid wearing like a shitty Halloween mask

893
00:50:33,100 --> 00:50:43,740
on Walmart showing his penis to everyone. "I'm my dad and this is my penis. Nobody call my wife.

894
00:50:43,740 --> 00:50:52,620
No one tell my new wife I'm doing this." And then the stepdad is just like, "Listen, I really wanted

895
00:50:52,620 --> 00:50:57,260
this marriage to work out but I cannot take care of this child anymore. This is the worst child I've

896
00:50:57,260 --> 00:51:02,780
ever I've ever met in my life. I'm leaving." Next one is a tie. We should move on to the next one

897
00:51:02,780 --> 00:51:06,220
because this is a ton of comments number five is your sister and it has 22

898
00:51:06,220 --> 00:51:13,620

00:51:21,860 --> 00:51:27,460

914
00:52:39,140 --> 00:52:43,060

sister your girls in your life took like a pill. It's actually it's a paranormal

916

it stands for paranormal mind spirit and it's a blood demon that takes control of

917
00:52:52,460 --> 00:52:59,020
their mind little did I know that PMS stood for Patrick can't think of anything

I don't need, I mean they don't even make the top 100 kinds of family members.

929
00:53:36,380 --> 00:53:39,380
How can we not talk about family when cousins all that we got.

934
00:54:09,800 --> 00:54:14,340
lived in my basement at least at one point in my life and that's true. My uncle

935
00:54:14,340 --> 00:54:18,840
looks like Moby. Uncles love basements. Uncles love living in your basement and

living in your grandparents basement and owning two tarantulas. Uh-huh. Yeah. Uncles

938
00:54:29,300 --> 00:54:33,960
love having a iguana in your house. Uncles love having a chair that they got from

939
00:54:33,960 --> 00:54:38,400
their friend's barbershop in their basement apartment. That's the only chair.

940
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:42,600
- Uncles straight up love having like some weird

941
00:54:42,600 --> 00:54:44,800
beaded green necklace that they hang up

942
00:54:44,800 --> 00:54:47,220
on a thing that they hammered into the wall

943
00:54:47,220 --> 00:54:51,880
that kind of stays in your basement until you're like 16.

944
00:54:51,880 --> 00:54:55,240
- Uncles love having a Peruvian wife and melanoma.

945
00:54:55,240 --> 00:54:57,920
(laughing)

946
00:54:57,920 --> 00:55:01,760
- Uncles love wearing those five toe running shoes

947
00:55:01,760 --> 00:55:02,880
and running through the forest

948
00:55:02,880 --> 00:55:04,680
and hurting their leg really badly

949
00:55:04,680 --> 00:55:06,280
because they ran too far.

950
00:55:06,280 --> 00:55:07,600
- And they love gardening.

951
00:55:07,600 --> 00:55:08,720
There's two kinds of uncles.

952
00:55:08,720 --> 00:55:11,080
There's the gamer uncle and the gardening uncle.

953
00:55:11,080 --> 00:55:13,320
I have a prankster skateboard uncle.

954
00:55:13,320 --> 00:55:14,560
That's a gamer uncle.

955
00:55:14,560 --> 00:55:16,640
Uncles love to get drunk on Easter

956
00:55:16,640 --> 00:55:19,520
and then go to the farmhouse that's like adjacent

957
00:55:19,520 --> 00:55:22,680
to your house and try to ride the horse

958
00:55:22,680 --> 00:55:25,000
and break their jaw.

959
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:27,000
Yeah, when uncles dress up for church,

960
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:29,040
they never even think to tuck in their shirts.

961
00:55:29,040 --> 00:55:29,880
Yeah.

962
00:55:29,880 --> 00:55:32,840
No, they don't even, they arrive and you're like,

963
00:55:32,840 --> 00:55:34,440
hey, your shirt's untucked.

964
00:55:34,440 --> 00:55:36,360
And they're like, I didn't even think about that.

965
00:55:36,360 --> 00:55:40,760
I also do, I damn think, I do have a racist New Hampshire uncle also, which I talked about

966
00:55:40,760 --> 00:55:41,760
briefly.

967
00:55:41,760 --> 00:55:43,960
I don't know what part of New Hampshire, I don't really talk to him.

968
00:55:43,960 --> 00:55:44,960
His name's Patrick.

969
00:55:44,960 --> 00:55:45,960
Could be one of my neighbors.

970
00:55:45,960 --> 00:55:48,260
What if we found out that you guys were related?

971
00:55:48,260 --> 00:55:49,260
That would be funny.

972
00:55:49,260 --> 00:55:50,260
That would be really funny.

973
00:55:50,260 --> 00:55:51,260
How would that change your relationship?

974
00:55:51,260 --> 00:55:54,580
Probably, well, Camber being my cousin, hold up.

975
00:55:54,580 --> 00:55:57,160
We're gonna be hanging out way more.

976
00:55:57,160 --> 00:55:59,060
Hey, let's move in together.

977
00:55:59,060 --> 00:56:05,120

00:56:27,920 --> 00:56:32,920
Boston Irish New England family okay how many uncles do you have I honestly don't

985
00:56:32,920 --> 00:56:34,260
- I don't know, I have too many to count.

986
00:56:34,260 --> 00:56:35,360
- He can't even count.

987
00:56:35,360 --> 00:56:36,200
- Well, okay.

988
00:56:36,200 --> 00:56:40,040
- He can't even count how many uncles there are.

989
00:56:40,040 --> 00:56:40,880
- He's counting.

990
00:56:40,880 --> 00:56:43,340
- We're not doing, okay, here's the problem.

991
00:56:43,340 --> 00:56:46,380
The problem here, on my mom's side I only have one,

992
00:56:46,380 --> 00:56:48,380
but my dad's side is the big family.

993
00:56:48,380 --> 00:56:52,640
- My mom's, my aunt's, I got seven aunts and uncles.

994
00:56:52,640 --> 00:56:55,640
- I have, I'm trying to, 'cause aunts don't count.

995
00:56:55,640 --> 00:56:56,480
I don't give a fuck about aunts.

996
00:56:56,480 --> 00:56:58,320
- And I got 15 cousins.

997
00:56:58,320 --> 00:57:00,200
- I literally have 17 cousins.

998
00:57:00,200 --> 00:57:01,480
- Two, three.

999
00:57:01,480 --> 00:57:02,440
- On one side.

1000
00:57:02,440 --> 00:57:04,440
I have 17 cousins on one side.

1001
00:57:04,440 --> 00:57:06,440
And then I only have two on the other.

1002
00:57:06,440 --> 00:57:10,440
So I have 17 cousins in total.

1003
00:57:10,440 --> 00:57:14,440
So we're tied for cousins.

1004
00:57:14,440 --> 00:57:18,440
My dad's side of the family is famous in Cambridge.

1005
00:57:18,440 --> 00:57:20,440
I have 18 cousins.

1006
00:57:20,440 --> 00:57:27,440
There's a square in Cambridge named after my great grandfather.

1007
00:57:27,440 --> 00:57:29,440
No there's not.

1008
00:57:29,440 --> 00:57:30,600
- Francis Downey.

1009
00:57:30,600 --> 00:57:35,080
It's right by one of the bus stops.

1010
00:57:35,080 --> 00:57:37,520
He was a doctor, he was a really--

1011
00:57:37,520 --> 00:57:39,680
- You can be a doctor, Francis.

1012
00:57:39,680 --> 00:57:41,360
- Yeah, you're a doctor.

1013
00:57:41,360 --> 00:57:42,880
Here, we'll name this square after you.

1014
00:57:42,880 --> 00:57:44,840
- You guys are stupid, man.

1015
00:57:44,840 --> 00:57:46,000
All the fans know he was--

1016
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:47,960
- I think my uncle's having another kid too,

1017
00:57:47,960 --> 00:57:49,640
so I might have 19 cousins.

1018
00:57:49,640 --> 00:57:52,240
- Oh, I just got a, wait, hold on, I got a page.

1019
00:57:52,240 --> 00:57:54,080
- You did not get a page.

1020
00:57:54,080 --> 00:57:56,960
I can see your camera, you did not get a page.

1021
00:57:56,960 --> 00:57:59,400
- Hold on, let me call, oh, it's my uncle, Michael.

1022
00:57:59,400 --> 00:58:02,320
I just have two new cousins.

1023
00:58:02,320 --> 00:58:03,160
You don't have two new cousins.

1024
00:58:03,160 --> 00:58:04,000
Their names are Ricardo and Ricardo.

1025
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:06,400
You wish you did, pal.

1026
00:58:06,400 --> 00:58:10,240
Yeah, but Caleb, you will never be an uncle.

1027
00:58:10,240 --> 00:58:11,080
I will.

1028
00:58:11,080 --> 00:58:12,240
You are not an uncle.

1029
00:58:12,240 --> 00:58:13,520
I'm already an uncle.

1030
00:58:13,520 --> 00:58:14,360
I'm an uncle.

1031
00:58:14,360 --> 00:58:15,180
You're not an uncle.

1032
00:58:15,180 --> 00:58:16,880
I'm an uncle by marriage, but I'm not married yet.

1033
00:58:16,880 --> 00:58:17,720
Nah.

1034
00:58:17,720 --> 00:58:18,540
I'm almost an uncle.

1035
00:58:18,540 --> 00:58:19,380
(gagging)

1036
00:58:19,380 --> 00:58:20,220
That doesn't count.

1037
00:58:20,220 --> 00:58:21,040
I'm bordering on uncle.

1038
00:58:21,040 --> 00:58:21,880
It counts, dude.

1039
00:58:21,880 --> 00:58:22,720
It does not count.

1040
00:58:22,720 --> 00:58:23,540
You don't count.

1041
00:58:23,540 --> 00:58:24,380
I count.

1042
00:58:24,380 --> 00:58:25,220
You can't count.

1043
00:58:25,220 --> 00:58:26,040
I'm a real uncle.

1044
00:58:26,040 --> 00:58:26,880
You're not.

1045
00:58:26,880 --> 00:58:27,720
I'm a real uncle.

1046
00:58:27,720 --> 00:58:28,540
You're a step uncle.

1047
00:58:28,540 --> 00:58:30,540
There's no such thing as a step uncle.

1048
00:58:30,540 --> 00:58:31,380
- You're a step uncle.

1049
00:58:31,380 --> 00:58:32,200
- You're a step uncle.

1050
00:58:32,200 --> 00:58:35,500
- There's no such, nobody, let me look this up.

1051
00:58:35,500 --> 00:58:36,340
Step uncle.

1052
00:58:36,340 --> 00:58:37,300
- You're not the step uncle,

1053
00:58:37,300 --> 00:58:38,420
you're the uncle that stepped up.

1054
00:58:38,420 --> 00:58:41,220
- A step uncle is, oh, it exists.

1055
00:58:41,220 --> 00:58:42,540
- You're so stupid, dude.

1056
00:58:42,540 --> 00:58:44,620
- You're the uncle that stepped up.

1057
00:58:44,620 --> 00:58:46,020
- But nobody says, nobody says,

1058
00:58:46,020 --> 00:58:48,060
like, my uncle Tim is not my step uncle.

1059
00:58:48,060 --> 00:58:50,940
He is my uncle who likes Bud Light.

1060
00:58:50,940 --> 00:58:52,380
- No, he's your step uncle, pal.

1061
00:58:52,380 --> 00:58:54,020
- No, no.

1062
00:58:54,020 --> 00:58:55,140
- Do you guys draw a distinction

1063
00:58:55,140 --> 00:58:56,700
between uncle and great uncle?

1064
00:58:58,020 --> 00:58:59,560
- All uncles are great.

1065
00:58:59,560 --> 00:59:00,500
- Yeah, exactly.

1066
00:59:00,500 --> 00:59:01,700
- Yeah, so there's a distinction.

1067
00:59:01,700 --> 00:59:03,700
- If I'm just counting uncles,

1068
00:59:03,700 --> 00:59:05,900
I think I only have four or five,

1069
00:59:05,900 --> 00:59:08,180
but if great uncles, I have very many,

1070
00:59:08,180 --> 00:59:11,260
'cause my grandmother has 11 brothers.

1071
00:59:11,260 --> 00:59:12,700
- I have six uncles.

1072
00:59:12,700 --> 00:59:14,500
- And that's just my grandmother.

1073
00:59:14,500 --> 00:59:16,300
So just so you guys know,

1074
00:59:16,300 --> 00:59:18,500
I have way more uncles than you.

1075
00:59:18,500 --> 00:59:20,140
- I have six uncles.

1076
00:59:20,140 --> 00:59:22,620
- I literally just said I have at least 16,

1077
00:59:22,620 --> 00:59:23,460
and a lot more that I don't know.

1078
00:59:23,460 --> 00:59:26,340
- You don't have 16 uncles, I have six uncles.

1079
00:59:26,340 --> 00:59:29,060
- Your six is such a pathetically low number, I'm sorry.

1080
00:59:29,060 --> 00:59:30,660
- Six is a good number of uncles.

1081
00:59:30,660 --> 00:59:31,700
- Do you think that's a good number

1082
00:59:31,700 --> 00:59:33,340
'cause that's as high as you can count?

1083
00:59:33,340 --> 00:59:34,700
- I can count to 20.

1084
00:59:34,700 --> 00:59:35,780
- No, you can't, dude.

1085
00:59:35,780 --> 00:59:40,780
- One, two, skip a few, 17, 18, 19, 20.

1086
00:59:40,780 --> 00:59:45,380
- Patrick thinks there's a number called skip a few.

1087
00:59:45,380 --> 00:59:47,780
He heard someone say that one time in elementary school

1088
00:59:47,780 --> 00:59:50,080
and he's like, I just learned the magic number.

1089
00:59:50,080 --> 00:59:54,180
Number eight is sister-in-law

1090
00:59:54,180 --> 00:59:57,800
and the top comment here says, "Her middle name is Poison."

1091
00:59:57,800 --> 01:00:01,140
- And then Epic Jake says, "Sister Poison in law."

1092
01:00:01,140 --> 01:00:02,600
Sister Poison law.

1093
01:00:02,600 --> 01:00:04,860
(laughing)

1094
01:00:04,860 --> 01:00:07,500
Doesn't even say in law.

1095
01:00:07,500 --> 01:00:08,340
- Your aunt.

1096
01:00:08,340 --> 01:00:10,020
- I don't, I don't, number 10 is mother-

1097
01:00:10,020 --> 01:00:10,860
- I barely even recognize aunts.

1098
01:00:10,860 --> 01:00:11,980
- Number 10 is mother-in-law,

1099
01:00:11,980 --> 01:00:14,180
and it says, "If she beefs you."

1100
01:00:14,180 --> 01:00:16,420
(laughing)

1101
01:00:16,420 --> 01:00:19,300
- I like on aunts, somebody says,

1102
01:00:19,300 --> 01:00:21,820
"I'm vegetarian and my aunt Marsha

1103
01:00:21,820 --> 01:00:27,900
makes me eat meat anyway from I hate school what if I'm said nope my aunts are

1104
01:00:27,900 --> 01:00:34,180
nice number 12 is your niece slash nephew I never felt a connection to those kids

1105
01:00:34,180 --> 01:00:39,980
who are my niece and nephew mostly because they don't know I exist that's

1106
01:00:39,980 --> 01:00:44,780
why they're the worst they haven't even reached out hi there has some really good

1107
01:00:44,780 --> 01:00:51,220
stuff here in these Latin this he's finishing this one off we passed them

1108
01:00:51,220 --> 01:00:55,100
everybody passed the baton to him yeah that one and then 16 on half sistery I

1109
01:00:55,100 --> 01:00:58,380

1112
01:01:11,700 --> 01:01:15,400
I'm an uncle I just checked hi there's profile it's a really good profile

1113
01:01:15,400 --> 01:01:19,180
nineteen-year-old male from Texas I'm a nineteen-year-old man a

1114
01:01:19,180 --> 01:01:23,420
a non-denominational follower of Christ, a Trump supporter, and all I say in lists is purely my

1115
01:01:23,420 --> 01:01:27,580
opinion, although some opinions are considered fact, like Jesus being the smartest man,

1116
01:01:27,580 --> 01:01:31,820
so please don't hate me for it. So I figured I'd put it this way, since messaging all my

1117
01:01:31,820 --> 01:01:35,420
followers about this isn't exactly a great way to introduce myself and is time-consuming.

1118
01:01:35,420 --> 01:01:39,340
Apparently, there used to be a chatroom on the Top 10s. The link to my homepage is a petition

1119
01:01:39,340 --> 01:01:43,100
to get that back. Mind signing it? I'm not going to ask anything else commercial of you.

1120
01:01:45,900 --> 01:01:50,340
here he has a giant he has a huge list of his favorite things rock and roll it's

1122
01:01:54,820 --> 01:02:00,820
my least favorite things rap Satan China and the Simpsons and then wait what

1124
01:02:05,820 --> 01:02:13,500

Simpsons if you don't like Homer yeah you're gonna hate Bart and Lisa paste

1127
01:02:21,740 --> 01:02:25,340
this on your profile if you like dystopian books the fire it's a fire

1128
01:02:25,340 --> 01:02:30,980
emoji a heart emoji of firefighter a key and a bow and arrow the fire is

1129
01:02:30,980 --> 01:02:34,500
representative of divergent the heart represents unwind the firefighter

1130
01:02:34,500 --> 01:02:39,060
represents Fahrenheit 451 the key represents incarceration and the bow and

1131
01:02:39,060 --> 01:02:43,180
arrow represents the Hunger Games I feel like Ray Bradbury would have killed

1132
01:02:43,180 --> 01:02:48,180
himself if he saw that company that he's keeping. Anti-bullying message, this is how he closes

1133
01:02:48,180 --> 01:02:53,260
out his profile. The girl you just called fat, she is overdosing on diet pills. The girl

1134
01:02:53,260 --> 01:02:57,420
you just called ugly, she spends hours putting makeup on hoping people will like her. The

1135
01:02:57,420 --> 01:03:02,820
boy you just tripped, he is abused enough at home, just enough. See that man with the ugly

1136
01:03:02,820 --> 01:03:07,900
scars? See that man with the ugly scars? He fought for his country. That's the joker.

1137
01:03:07,900 --> 01:03:10,980
- That guy, that guy you just made fun of for crying,

1138
01:03:10,980 --> 01:03:12,860
his mother is dying.

1139
01:03:12,860 --> 01:03:14,580
Put this on your profile if you're against bullying.

1140
01:03:14,580 --> 01:03:16,900
I bet 95% of you won't put this on your profile,

1141
01:03:16,900 --> 01:03:19,240
but I'm sure the people with a heart and a backbone will.

1142
01:03:19,240 --> 01:03:22,460
Which percentage are you, 5% or 95%?

1143
01:03:22,460 --> 01:03:23,920
- This is what-- - 5% or leave.

1144
01:03:23,920 --> 01:03:28,500
- The 5%-er, that's what Rich Piana was talking about.

1145
01:03:28,500 --> 01:03:30,900
Rich Piana, the 5%-er stuff. - These are 5%-ers.

1146
01:03:30,900 --> 01:03:34,540
Yeah, this is a Nation of Islam anti-bullying message.

1147
01:03:34,540 --> 01:03:36,400
- Oh, yeah, is that?

1148
01:03:36,400 --> 01:03:40,040
