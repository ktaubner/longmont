51
00:03:02,460 --> 00:03:06,140
tentacle in her thing. That was a fling. That was a fling. It's like that was that was her hall pass

52
00:03:06,140 --> 00:03:10,940
to make sure she wasn't gay before the wedding. Everybody does that. It's true. I have to fuck

53
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:15,260
one guy before I before I commit to my wife forever. It's like it's like when

54
00:03:15,260 --> 00:03:21,060
they DNA test you at town hall. They DNA test you to see if you're gay.

55
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:25,780
They get the the gene they find the gay gene and they say you can't marry. I don't know how

56
00:03:25,780 --> 00:03:31,060
to tell you this you can't marry your wife because you're gay. Yeah. Oh no.

57
00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:39,580
Oh no. You know what should have tipped me off is that I'm a woman. Yeah I'm not gay what?

58
00:03:39,580 --> 00:03:44,900
that would be my reaction yeah I don't know why I remembered this today I don't

59
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:50,860
know how to segue this into this but I think I was looking at letterboxd and I

60
00:03:50,860 --> 00:03:55,020
said I was looking at my list of movies that I need to rewatch and I saw El

61
00:03:55,020 --> 00:03:58,740
Mariachi and I've never seen that I was thinking of the third movie in the

62
00:03:58,740 --> 00:04:04,300
Robert Rodriguez Mexico trilogy Once Upon a Time in Mexico but I saw that when I

63
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:09,280
was like seven by accident I saw it like because I was sleeping on my parents

64
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:13,880
floor and I woke up at like midnight. It was on HBO and you remember how HBO used

65
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:22,000
to have softcore porn on at like midnight? Oh yeah dude. So when I was seven I saw

66
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:26,760
like that movie ended and then like this like I just remember it was like a

67
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:31,920
fucking it was a woman playing piano and she adjusted her boobs while she was

68
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:35,560
playing the piano. Like she was sitting there at the piano like you know when

69
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:38,640
you like crack your fingers and then start playing. She adjusted her boobs. That was like the

70
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:43,380
joke and I remember like seeing that I think like a couple minutes into the

71
00:04:43,380 --> 00:04:47,280
movie I like turned I was sleeping on my parents floor so I turned to my dad and

72
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:54,480
I was like this movie sucks I I the the softcore like Showtime porn when I was a

73
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:58,760
kid we had like a Showtime free trial yeah and one of those movies came on

74
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:02,760
late at night and I was like but I didn't know what it was and I watched

75
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:05,760
like the first 10 minutes and then I had to go to bed but I was like oh there's

76
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:09,160
like a really interesting movie that seemed like really really cool that's

77
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:13,000
like that's like an awesome movie I want to watch that later and so then the next

78
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,600
day I was like oh shit this is like this movies coming up mom we should watch

79
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:21,520
this movie like this is really good and then like five minutes past where I'd

80
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:26,040

81
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:33,440

82
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:40,400
awesome little pervert son is that so hard to believe yeah I just the idea of

83
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:44,320
just like seeing like a porno when you're really young and just being like

84
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:51,000
this movie's kind of cool yeah just like the exposition yeah right like you don't

85
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:55,720
know anything about like it's like when you see like a Quentin Tarantino movie

86
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:59,400
for the first time in middle school and you see like a title card like slam onto

87
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:04,760
the screen you're like holy fuck right I didn't even know you could do that this

88
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:09,960
must be one of those art movies yeah yeah damn they're talking in like a David

89
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:19,320
Lynch Ian kind of way yeah the dialogue in in the ghost in the teeny bikini is

90
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:25,600
very yeah the thing is those movies also there's like very little sex in them for

91
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:30,920
porn no no it's not usually like three scenes per 90 minutes basically so you

92
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:34,240
have to sit through 20 minutes of them being like we're not gonna be able to

93
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:38,680
afford rent this money yeah well you got to go visit the landlord and do whatever

94
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:43,840
it takes yeah yeah it's kind of a dark turn for one of those movies actually

95
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:47,800
it's a lot happier than that it's usually like Frankenstein's horny yeah

96
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:53,160
you got a suck-in fuck Frankenstein yeah cuz they do try to give it some

97
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:57,320
amount of like but they never show they never show anything going into anything

98
00:06:57,320 --> 00:07:01,680

106
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:40,200

And now I have a drone. Yeah, now I have a drone. So I don't even have to be at my mom's house.

Hey mom, I have this toy that I want to keep in your closet.

125
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:23,840
I have this kid in here. It's for Christmas. I used to have to give my mom a walkie

126
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:27,840
talkie and say, "Press this button when you're peeing."

127
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:30,100
(laughter)

128
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:34,780
- Anytime you fart, press this button.

129
00:09:34,780 --> 00:09:37,560
And then now, I just go on the Clubhouse app,

130
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:39,760
and I listen to my parents fart at each other.

131
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:40,600
- Is that, what is Clubhouse?

132
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:42,160
- Now I have the ring doorbell,

133
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:44,500
and I just had to move the toilet to the front door.

134
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:46,760
(laughter)

135
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:50,680
- Is Clubhouse, is that the, what is that?

136
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:53,000
- It's for listening to your parents fart at each other.

137
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,480
- I think I heard, I think I saw like a clip,

138
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:56,320
like something on Twitter.

139
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:57,160
- It's like the, it's a thing where like--

140
00:09:57,160 --> 00:10:01,040
I think on Twitter the other day there was like a group Jack off session there and

141
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:04,480
everyone was like yeah they were like you got to delete they got to delete this

142
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:07,560
fucking app. Nope that's not the kind of clubhouse I want to be a part of.

143
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:14,880
What is clubhouse? I've heard of it maybe once before. It's like an app where they have like they have like people who are

144
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:19,200
mostly like media people have these like rooms where they're basically doing like

145
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:24,440
a live podcast or like a Q&A thing but then also do that people can talk back

146
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:31,000
so you can like be listening like Eric Weinstein talk about how like math

147
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:37,000
proves that gay marriage is wrong and be like you're fat mm-hmm so it's kind of a

148
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:41,840
great app that sounds really technologically awesome it's very

149
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:45,160
advanced and I came up with it it seems like something that we could make use of

150
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:48,880
and maybe do some like awesome stuff with it's kind of I don't like I don't

151
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:53,640
trust it cuz someone's gonna come in and start jacking off nobody jacks off to

152
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:58,640
anything dude what do you mean people just say people are always

153
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:02,240
nobody actually does that and that's yeah mm-hmm

154
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:05,940
they're probably just like sharing a video from their camera roll to their

155
00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:10,440
yeah to their feet 90% of people when they're alone with their penis will just

156
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:13,560

260
00:17:08,100 --> 00:17:13,860
Anton Yelchin yeah oh I think you Patrick got freaked out I think because we said

261
00:17:13,860 --> 00:17:17,580
that Patrick killed him oh yeah well no he killed himself with like a Rube

262
00:17:17,580 --> 00:17:23,380
Goldberg machine yeah he crushed himself yeah he got behind the Jeep and just

263
00:17:23,380 --> 00:17:31,980
went all right nobody stopped me like it's literally it's literally a final

264
00:17:31,980 --> 00:17:36,620
destination death right yeah no I think it was just I I was just thinking about

265
00:17:36,620 --> 00:17:41,060
it and I was like ah that's like just such a shitty way to go just an accidental

266
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:46,520
jeep murder well here if you think about it he was actually a really bad guy

267
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:50,060
because he was in Green Room and he starred with a bunch of Nazis that's a

268
00:17:50,060 --> 00:17:55,820
really good point he said he didn't do anything he sings Nazi punks fuck off to

269
00:17:55,820 --> 00:18:01,100
them and then saying that and then guys yeah in the movie and in real life he

270
00:18:01,100 --> 00:18:05,420
was being sarcastic when he's saying Nazi punks fuck off yeah they actually did

271
00:18:05,420 --> 00:18:16,580
ADR he actually said "Nazi punks come over" "Rock on" "Nazi punks rock on" "Nazi punks keep

272
00:18:16,580 --> 00:18:23,020
doing what you're doing baby I love that shit" It's funny though cuz like the

273
00:18:23,020 --> 00:18:27,460
lyrics like Nazi punks is supposed to mean like like yeah it means like skin

274
00:18:27,460 --> 00:18:30,940
heads but it also means like people who were like gatekeeping like punk stuff I

275
00:18:30,940 --> 00:18:35,640
think I think I heard that somewhere on it I honestly Nazi punks fuck off is about

276
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:40,380
gatekeeping you think it's not about Nazis I think it's about both I watched I

277
00:18:40,380 --> 00:18:44,640
showed that movie to my dad cuz he's a huge like punk fan and it was like

278
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:49,780
probably it was one of the it was such a great father something because like when

279
00:18:49,780 --> 00:18:53,220
they show up to that like venue and it's filled with all the Nazis and he like

280
00:18:53,220 --> 00:18:57,360
looks at me he's like like oh they should play Nazi punks fuck off like as a

281
00:18:57,360 --> 00:19:00,460
joke and I just like had to like even straight face and they started playing

282
00:19:00,460 --> 00:19:03,060
it and just seeing his face light up and look at me honestly.

283
00:19:03,060 --> 00:19:05,060
That movie's made for someone like your dad.

284
00:19:05,060 --> 00:19:06,060
Oh yeah.

285
00:19:06,060 --> 00:19:11,300
It's like an old punk who has that like, that's like how he would write it exactly.

286
00:19:11,300 --> 00:19:13,660
Yeah, it's like what happened to him.

287
00:19:13,660 --> 00:19:18,980
Yeah, no the first line in the song is "Punk ain't no religious cult, punk means thinking

288
00:19:18,980 --> 00:19:19,980
for yourself.

289
00:19:19,980 --> 00:19:23,460
You ain't hardcore cause you spike your hair when a jock still lives inside your head."

290
00:19:23,460 --> 00:19:26,420
So it's about Nazis but it's also about jerks.

291
00:19:26,420 --> 00:19:27,620
And jocks dude.

292
00:19:27,620 --> 00:19:29,860
Jerks and jocks, the real fuckin Nazis.

293
00:19:29,860 --> 00:19:34,460

296
00:19:46,140 --> 00:19:55,780
the first to go their coat the football coach is a complete Nazi dude yeah it's

297
00:19:55,780 --> 00:20:02,780
Swastika was actually a jock symbol of peace for many, for thousands of years.

298
00:20:02,780 --> 00:20:07,780
Yeah, it was for hockey sticks.

299
00:20:07,780 --> 00:20:10,780
And then they bastardized it, turned it into that disgusting...

300
00:20:10,780 --> 00:20:13,780
That's where the phrase "HE double hockey sticks" comes from.

301
00:20:13,780 --> 00:20:18,780
Yeah, but it was "HE quadruple hockey sticks" which meant "HE jock."

302
00:20:18,780 --> 00:20:21,780
And "HE" stood for "Hitler's Evil."

303
00:20:21,780 --> 00:20:30,820
evil no Hitler's evil quadruple hockey sticks yeah don't be saying no swastika

304
00:20:30,820 --> 00:20:34,940
around me we call that Hitler's evil quadruple hockey sticks around here yeah

305
00:20:34,940 --> 00:20:42,140

310
00:21:06,980 --> 00:21:12,060

mmm I don't know beer is you can make nerdy about beer dude it's I think one

314
00:21:28,220 --> 00:21:34,460
of those one of the the greatest failings of society is that people like

315
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:39,260

I don't know

343
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:36,280
Maybe we should try and sneak our way onto a TV show

00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:38,280
Yeah let's sneak ourselves onto

345
00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:40,280
Deep Space Nine

346
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:42,280
Mandalorian has an opening

347
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:44,280
We should be the triplet

348
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:46,280
No all three of us

349
00:23:46,280 --> 00:23:48,280
All three of us could like stack up on top of each other

350
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:50,280
And probably be like the same size as that lady

351
00:23:50,280 --> 00:24:09,520
we'd have to stack in front of each other - absolutely dude yeah how did she not

352
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:14,240
just like kill whoever tried to fire her yeah yeah just like crush you could have

353
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:18,060
put any of them in a headlock yeah absolutely apparently somebody's I saw

354
00:24:18,060 --> 00:24:21,300
somebody say that they were like trying to fire her since November or something

355
00:24:21,300 --> 00:24:24,740
yeah oh yeah she was saying it's like I said a bunch of transphobic scared of

356
00:24:24,740 --> 00:24:30,100
this lady so crazy like to be in like a star were like make probably making

357
00:24:30,100 --> 00:24:34,020
right insane fucking money oh my god she probably millions and just be like I'm

358
00:24:34,020 --> 00:24:39,020
not gonna stop sharing these memes right yeah so funny it's so funny I compared

359
00:24:39,020 --> 00:24:43,780
herself to a fucking a Jew in the Holocaust that is like the funniest

360
00:24:43,780 --> 00:24:48,460
fucking thing she could have like that's like you get fired from Baskin-Robbins

361
00:24:48,460 --> 00:24:53,660
for doing that you like that's like automatic fire wherever you fucking work

362
00:24:53,660 --> 00:24:58,160
and she was like I gotta do it all you have to do is like make an alt like

363
00:24:58,160 --> 00:25:04,020
right to be able to do that she also she would have gotten in less trouble if she

364
00:25:04,020 --> 00:25:10,140
had said it's like it's she feels more like Hitler you know it was it was a

365
00:25:10,140 --> 00:25:13,820
a weird you like yeah I'm being a conservative nowadays it's like being

366
00:25:13,820 --> 00:25:19,460
Hitler during the Holocaust she would have people been like oh sure yeah I

367
00:25:19,460 --> 00:25:26,060
guess she's making a point go off Hitler go lady Hitler lady Hitler you snapped

368
00:25:26,060 --> 00:25:32,020
on that damn if there was a female Hitler that's a that's a one of the

369
00:25:32,020 --> 00:25:36,300
really that's a really good Venture Brothers joke the girl Hitler there's

370
00:25:36,300 --> 00:25:41,980
like a supervillain who's just named girl Hitler. Oh really? We should try and get on a

371
00:25:41,980 --> 00:25:48,800
cartoon. We should dude. Yeah. We should try to get into Trolls 2. Oh well Trolls 2

372
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:53,260
already had, we should get into Trolls 3. Mm-hmm no we're gonna get into Trolls 2. I don't think

373
00:25:53,260 --> 00:25:57,620
we're the first podcast to do this. Yeah I think we're gonna be the first trio of podcasters who are gonna

374
00:25:57,620 --> 00:26:01,500
start a campaign to get into Trolls 2. You know what's funny is I did make that

375
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:07,260
joke and then Cameron did call me out for it was like early on in the podcast

376
00:26:07,260 --> 00:26:12,260
because I remember that I don't know what podcast did this before my brother my

377
00:26:12,260 --> 00:26:15,780
brother and me oh they tried to get on trolls yeah they did trolls yeah they

378
00:26:15,780 --> 00:26:20,620
got into trolls - that's right damn it you fucking it beat us to everything do

379
00:26:20,620 --> 00:26:26,020
you think we could get them to give us a transformer we could be transformers in

380
00:26:26,020 --> 00:26:30,180
the next movie we could be like guys what kind of transformers would you guys be

381
00:26:30,180 --> 00:26:36,580
one with beautiful hair i'd be the one that talks through the radio sometimes bumblebee i'd be the

382
00:26:36,580 --> 00:26:41,700
two black transformers yeah the yeah the ones voiced by tom kenney yeah they're called like

383
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:48,820
sketch and dj or whatever like wearing durags literally like car parts and they go yo yo yo

384
00:26:48,820 --> 00:26:55,220
i don't know if this is true but in my brain they at some point call shia labeouf cracker

385
00:26:55,220 --> 00:26:57,220
I think probably they do.

386
00:26:57,220 --> 00:26:59,220
That's so awesome.

387
00:26:59,220 --> 00:27:01,220
There's something, they die in a real-

388
00:27:01,220 --> 00:27:03,220
they die- when they die they say something

389
00:27:03,220 --> 00:27:05,220
fucked up too but I can't remember what it was.

390
00:27:05,220 --> 00:27:07,220
The N word?

391
00:27:07,220 --> 00:27:09,220
Yeah.

392
00:27:09,220 --> 00:27:11,220
Racist

393
00:27:11,220 --> 00:27:13,220
Transformers

394
00:27:13,220 --> 00:27:15,220
Revenge of the Fallen.

395
00:27:15,220 --> 00:27:17,220
Oh that's when they- they die in that one?

396
00:27:17,220 --> 00:27:19,220
That one's like- I thought they died in the first one.

397
00:27:19,220 --> 00:27:21,220
Their names are

398
00:27:21,220 --> 00:27:23,220
Skids and Mudflap.

399
00:27:23,220 --> 00:27:25,220

400
00:27:25,220 --> 00:27:27,220

401
00:27:27,220 --> 00:27:31,220
Hambone and Miles Davis

402
00:27:31,220 --> 00:27:33,220
the two

403
00:27:33,220 --> 00:27:35,220
black transformers

404
00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:41,220
damn, it's so funny to imagine Michael Bay

405
00:27:41,220 --> 00:27:43,220
just like, yeah dude, you got that

406
00:27:43,220 --> 00:27:45,220
I'm reading this article here about it

407
00:27:45,220 --> 00:27:47,220
from back in the animated series

408
00:27:47,220 --> 00:27:49,220
there was a, there was a

409
00:27:49,220 --> 00:27:51,220
an Autobot who talked in a

410
00:27:51,220 --> 00:27:56,260
a suave funky street style you transformed it to a Porsche named Jazz.

411
00:27:56,260 --> 00:27:59,220
Yeah, yeah, that's I thought that uh...

412
00:27:59,220 --> 00:27:59,620
Oh, a Porsche?

413
00:27:59,620 --> 00:28:01,060
A Scatman Crothers voiced him.

414
00:28:01,060 --> 00:28:02,980
Yeah, no I thought Jazz was um...

415
00:28:02,980 --> 00:28:07,140
Like an Oldsmobile or like a Cadillac or something if you're just gonna full send it like that.

416
00:28:07,140 --> 00:28:07,620
Yeah.

417
00:28:07,620 --> 00:28:09,140
If you're gonna name yourself Jazz.

418
00:28:09,140 --> 00:28:11,220
Man.

419
00:28:11,220 --> 00:28:12,100
I don't know.

420
00:28:12,100 --> 00:28:12,980
Missed opportunities but...

421
00:28:12,980 --> 00:28:17,460
Oh damn dude, they had Jazz in the first live action movie too and when he lands on earth

422
00:28:17,460 --> 00:28:21,540
he announces what's cracking little bitches this looks like a cool place to

423
00:28:21,540 --> 00:28:27,820
kick it is it the whole thing that they like learn to talk from like listening

424
00:28:27,820 --> 00:28:33,020

449
00:30:15,180 --> 00:30:16,020
- Okay.

450
00:30:16,020 --> 00:30:16,860

- So yeah.

452
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:18,520
- Everything's forgiven.

453
00:30:18,520 --> 00:30:20,520
- Yeah, it's a black guy and his white friend.

454
00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:21,360
- Yeah.

455
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:23,260

- Yeah.

457
00:30:24,100 --> 00:30:24,920
- Yeah.

458
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:26,700
- They should have made more Transformers

459
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:28,580
different ethnicities.

460
00:30:28,580 --> 00:30:29,820
- You think so?

461
00:30:29,820 --> 00:30:31,940
- They had a samurai one in the fourth one, dude.

462
00:30:31,940 --> 00:30:34,180
(laughing)

463
00:30:34,180 --> 00:30:39,860
at a samurai one yeah those are you're so sick oh yeah dude those are the some of

464
00:30:39,860 --> 00:30:44,860
the best action movies at all time at any time the third one is just perfect no

465
00:30:44,860 --> 00:30:53,340
that's not cinema to me oh yeah you wanna yeah what's what's what cinema to you

466
00:30:53,340 --> 00:30:57,100
well first of all honestly the Transformers killed thousands of people

467
00:30:57,100 --> 00:31:01,500
and it seems like the movies glorifying them mm-hmm it's glorifying a

468
00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:08,540
a Decepticon. It's glorifying cars and honestly I don't, I can't drive so. Yeah where's the trains?

469
00:31:08,540 --> 00:31:12,220
It's actually really fucked up for people who don't have licenses. Right you know you're kind

470
00:31:12,220 --> 00:31:18,540
of rubbing it in the audience's face if they can't drive. This is a movie that it's rated D

471
00:31:18,540 --> 00:31:26,620
for drivers only. It would be D-O. No. Yeah. Dude imagine seeing Transformers at a drive-in movie

472
00:31:26,620 --> 00:31:30,620
theater and one of the cars transform. You would be watching the movie you would look around you'd

473
00:31:30,620 --> 00:31:34,300
think any of these cars could be a transformer it would totally say no

474
00:31:34,300 --> 00:31:38,820
insurance the one with mark walberg there's like a i've only seen this scene

475
00:31:38,820 --> 00:31:43,780
from that or he's like jay miller did yeah he's in a barn mark walbert in a

476
00:31:43,780 --> 00:31:52,580
bar and he walks up and he's like i think i just found a transformer it's so

477
00:31:52,580 --> 00:32:05,500
so

478
00:32:05,500 --> 00:32:09,660
movie right now I think Beast Wars was always my go-to as kid. Beast Wars is sick.

479
00:32:09,660 --> 00:32:15,140
Did you ever watch Beetle Borgs? Did you ever watch Bababooey?

480
00:32:15,140 --> 00:32:19,860
Did you see Beetle Borgs? Do you remember you guys don't remember Beetle Borgs? I

481
00:32:19,860 --> 00:32:24,940
know of it but I didn't watch it. Oh it was like one of those like like super

482
00:32:24,940 --> 00:32:32,740
sentai shows. Yeah. But it was like I don't know what I was from Jouko B

483
00:32:32,740 --> 00:32:38,100
fighter it's a Japanese yeah it was like these kids who's like their dad is a

484
00:32:38,100 --> 00:32:43,580
Frankenstein and a Dracula no and they're also Power Rangers wait their dad is a

485
00:32:43,580 --> 00:32:49,900
Frankenstein and a Dracula they have they have count Fangula can't be both

486
00:32:49,900 --> 00:32:55,660
a dragon a Frankenstein so there it's not their parents this is just a house that

487
00:32:55,660 --> 00:32:59,820
they hang out in it's an old mansion that they hang out in and there's count

488
00:32:59,820 --> 00:33:08,300
fangula and there's flabber and there's mums who's a mummy and Franken beans and

489
00:33:08,300 --> 00:33:14,060
I love it dude the little people who fucking localized Japanese shows oh my

490
00:33:14,060 --> 00:33:21,060
god I got to have so like just be like yeah that guy's Franken beans I don't

491
00:33:21,060 --> 00:33:28,060
know see I don't think the the like the monsters I think the monsters were part

492
00:33:28,060 --> 00:33:32,060
of the localization I don't think they were in the Japanese show. Then what was

493
00:33:32,060 --> 00:33:37,180
the show? The show... Just them hanging out with in the house? Well I'll have to look

494
00:33:37,180 --> 00:33:45,260
but yeah I don't think I don't think that the beetle Borg's in this I don't know

495
00:33:45,260 --> 00:33:49,100
I've never seen the Japanese one I've only seen beetle Borg's. You're just making this up?

496
00:33:49,100 --> 00:33:53,140
No I'm not making this up. Then okay then why did you say they don't have monsters

497
00:33:53,140 --> 00:33:56,740
in it if you've never seen it? In the Japanese one I don't think they have. So you think

498
00:33:56,740 --> 00:34:00,060
there's no monsters because you've never seen the Japanese one I'm looking at the

499
00:34:00,060 --> 00:34:04,780
Wikipedia right now and what is leading you to say there's no monsters in it

500
00:34:04,780 --> 00:34:08,940
it's in Japanese and I can't read it

501
00:34:08,940 --> 00:34:16,940
that's fair dude it's forbidden knowledge it's not for you it's forbidden

502
00:34:16,940 --> 00:34:20,460
for ya no but I'm looking at it now no there's like parts of it that are in

503
00:34:20,460 --> 00:34:26,940
Japanese but it looks like there's no like there's no mention of the word

504
00:34:26,940 --> 00:34:30,420
there's I'm looking at for the word Dracula there's no mention of Dracula

505
00:34:30,420 --> 00:34:34,740
it's probably not called Dracula's on you go be fighter his name okay I'm looking

506
00:34:34,740 --> 00:34:39,080
for the word vampire nothing I'm gonna look for Frankenstein okay let's see

507
00:34:39,080 --> 00:34:46,020
here nothing is there any that is just like like like Dracula is there any like

508
00:34:46,020 --> 00:34:52,500
is it is a kanji for Dracula like a little drawing? It could be. Little fangs. That'd be cool.

509
00:34:52,500 --> 00:34:58,420
I feel like at some point you run out of things to, different lines to arrange and you should just be,

510
00:34:58,420 --> 00:35:05,300
for new words, just be making little tiny cute drawings, you know. That's what emoji was. Wow,

511
00:35:05,300 --> 00:35:11,140
emoji is Japanese language technically, huh? I don't want to say that. I think that's true.

512
00:35:13,780 --> 00:35:21,940
But yeah I think the localization for Beatleborgs, they were like fuck it let's make them hang

513
00:35:21,940 --> 00:35:25,540
out with the Dracula.

514
00:35:25,540 --> 00:35:30,140
Do you guys think we could do an overseas version of this show?

515
00:35:30,140 --> 00:35:31,140
Yeah.

516
00:35:31,140 --> 00:35:32,140
Absolutely.

517
00:35:32,140 --> 00:35:33,140
We should have already been doing that.

518
00:35:33,140 --> 00:35:34,140
Yeah.

519
00:35:34,140 --> 00:35:35,140
Wait what are we doing dude?

520
00:35:35,140 --> 00:35:36,700
We need like three Japanese guys who look like us.

521
00:35:36,700 --> 00:35:37,700
That's a good idea.

522
00:35:37,700 --> 00:35:39,060
If you're Japanese and you look like anybody send an email.

523
00:35:39,060 --> 00:35:45,720
If you are a Japanese guy who only speaks Japanese and you're listening to this, send us an email

524
00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:51,020
and we'll pay for the plastic surgery, we'll make you look like us.

525
00:35:51,020 --> 00:35:54,660
One guy that looks like all three of us.

526
00:35:54,660 --> 00:35:55,660
Very efficient.

527
00:35:55,660 --> 00:35:56,660
Yeah.

528
00:35:56,660 --> 00:35:57,660
Yeah.

529
00:35:57,660 --> 00:35:58,660
Like a Japanese businessman.

530
00:35:58,660 --> 00:35:59,660
Yeah.

531
00:35:59,660 --> 00:36:03,400
He's going to get it all done for us.

532
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:05,420
One man doing the work of three.

533
00:36:05,420 --> 00:36:06,420
Genius.

534
00:36:06,420 --> 00:36:07,420
Yeah.

535
00:36:07,420 --> 00:36:08,420
Pretty smart.

536
00:36:08,420 --> 00:36:13,740
like split down the middle like Two-Face but three ways. But the Neapolitan Man.

537
00:36:13,740 --> 00:36:20,780
Yeah. Oh, that's a good name for a movie dude. The Neapolitan Man? It sounds like a

538
00:36:20,780 --> 00:36:26,100
thriller, like a thriller about a guy with three personalities called the

539
00:36:26,100 --> 00:36:33,140
Neapolitan Man. Wow, you're right. That'd be so cool. One is white and one is black and

540
00:36:33,140 --> 00:36:35,140
and one is strawberry.

541
00:36:35,140 --> 00:36:36,980
(laughing)

542
00:36:36,980 --> 00:36:39,860
Yeah, he is much like the Transformers,

543
00:36:39,860 --> 00:36:41,560
he has a white and a black personality

544
00:36:41,560 --> 00:36:43,780
and then also a strawberry one.

545
00:36:43,780 --> 00:36:44,780
Yeah.

546
00:36:44,780 --> 00:36:47,820
And also if it's a thriller, he's evil?

547
00:36:47,820 --> 00:36:50,320
Or he's unraveling some evil plot.

548
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:53,380
That might be a better move.

549
00:36:53,380 --> 00:36:55,620
He has to kill a guy named Chocolate Chip.

550
00:36:55,620 --> 00:36:57,100
Man, why the fuck would you make,

551
00:36:57,100 --> 00:37:01,380
I don't understand why they were like,

552
00:37:01,380 --> 00:37:05,300
"Yeah, yeah, you know, this fucking, this Power Rangers show,

553
00:37:05,300 --> 00:37:07,100
"let's put fucking Boo-Berry in it."

554
00:37:07,100 --> 00:37:09,580
I don't, why, why do they do that?

555
00:37:09,580 --> 00:37:11,300
- It's 'cause kids like it, dude.

556
00:37:11,300 --> 00:37:13,020

- Yeah, a ghost. - Yeah, a ghost

561
00:37:19,220 --> 00:37:21,060

562
00:37:21,060 --> 00:37:22,660
- Oh, I'd love that. - Yeah, he's only gonna be

563
00:37:22,660 --> 00:37:24,300

564
00:37:24,300 --> 00:37:26,100
- Okay. - Yeah.

565
00:37:26,100 --> 00:37:27,860
- I made Cameron so mad talking about this.

566
00:37:27,860 --> 00:37:30,020
- Made Cameron so mad that he just left.

567
00:37:30,020 --> 00:37:31,020
Yeah.

568
00:37:31,020 --> 00:37:34,780
Son of a gun.

569
00:37:34,780 --> 00:37:42,020

It's so crazy, I was thinking about this earlier today, it's so crazy how like most ingredients

716
00:49:20,700 --> 00:49:24,700
in toothpaste you can't swallow.

717
00:49:24,700 --> 00:49:25,700
Like it says on-

718
00:49:25,700 --> 00:49:28,180
With toothpaste on the other hand, you can swallow all you want.

719
00:49:28,180 --> 00:49:29,180
Yeah.

720
00:49:29,180 --> 00:49:30,180
You can sit there and drink it.

721
00:49:30,180 --> 00:49:34,740
like it says like if you if you swallow it you have to contact poison control

722
00:49:34,740 --> 00:49:39,980
I don't yeah it does say yeah if you swallow it you should contact poison

723
00:49:39,980 --> 00:49:43,620
control yeah really yeah it depends on what like I use like arm and hammer

724
00:49:43,620 --> 00:49:50,060
toothpaste which is just like baking so toxic toothpaste yeah yeah yeah yeah I

725
00:49:50,060 --> 00:49:55,820
use I use an evil I just have a battery that I it is kind of hard to swallow

He might fuck up.

771
00:53:06,320 --> 00:53:10,460
Hey, Pinocchio, even Pinocchio fucks up sometimes.

00:53:10,460 --> 00:53:13,660
And that's okay.

773
00:53:13,660 --> 00:53:14,660

775
00:53:15,660 --> 00:53:16,940
You're not gonna forgive Pinocchio?

776
00:53:16,940 --> 00:53:18,780
I wouldn't forgive Pinocchio.

777
00:53:18,780 --> 00:53:19,780

778
00:53:19,780 --> 00:53:20,780

This damned Pinocchio.

781
00:53:22,780 --> 00:53:26,700
This damned Pinocchio has lied for the last time.

782
00:53:26,700 --> 00:53:29,500
This fucking guy, this Pinocchio, I'm sick of him.

783
00:53:29,500 --> 00:53:30,500
I'm sick of his face.

784
00:53:30,500 --> 00:53:37,500
Pinocchio's been terrorizing the town. He ain't even a real boy. Not yet.

785
00:53:37,500 --> 00:53:45,500
Pinocchio's not a real boy yet. His damned Pinocchio took my prize cricket and went in a well.

786
00:53:45,500 --> 00:53:52,500
Have you seen my cricket? Pinocchio tames Germany.

787
00:53:57,500 --> 00:54:07,340
that's a cowboy who hates Pinocchio. Pinocchio took my cricket! A cowboy has been wronged by Pinocchio.

788
00:54:07,340 --> 00:54:14,740
Have you seen a little wooden boy around in these parts? Yeah he's been stealing crickets left and right I don't

789
00:54:14,740 --> 00:54:19,980
know what the fuck to do with him. I listen I didn't bother me till he touched

790
00:54:19,980 --> 00:54:31,620
my cricket he came for he came for my neighbors cricket I said I wish I had a

791
00:54:31,620 --> 00:54:36,500
Pinocchio nose I'd be lying all the time yeah wait does he go does it go back to

792
00:54:36,500 --> 00:54:40,220
being small if he tells the truth I think I don't think says like I think

793
00:54:40,220 --> 00:54:45,180
yesterday saw it off it's permanently okay yeah I guess it does he that's got

794
00:54:45,180 --> 00:54:51,740
hurt yeah I don't know I don't know if that's what it does how does Google does

795
00:54:51,740 --> 00:54:59,060
how does Pinocchio does Pinocchio's nose shrink would you would you lie to save

796
00:54:59,060 --> 00:55:04,980
Pinocchio yeah cuz I don't have a Pinocchio nose so I can lie okay so this

797
00:55:04,980 --> 00:55:09,580
is really helpful my my Google search does Pinocchio's nose shrink well

798
00:55:09,580 --> 00:55:13,260
Pinocchio's nose would extend when he lies lied it seems the reverse is true

799
00:55:13,260 --> 00:55:17,220
in reality scientists from the University of Grenada have found that when a person

800
00:55:17,220 --> 00:55:20,280
is telling a lie their nose actually shrinks from the drop in temperature.

801
00:55:20,280 --> 00:55:26,060
What? I don't believe that. I don't think that's true. This is from times of India

802
00:55:26,060 --> 00:55:32,260
dot India times dot com and it's like it was like a Google info box you know that

803
00:55:32,260 --> 00:55:36,420
thing that happens when you google a question. Oh yeah. Yeah this story is

804
00:55:36,420 --> 00:55:41,660
when somebody lies their nose gets small. I don't think that's one of those things

805
00:55:41,660 --> 00:55:46,660
That's one of those things where you'll see an article that's like, "People who eat sandwiches

806
00:55:46,660 --> 00:55:49,340
have an 8% chance of never dying."

807
00:55:49,340 --> 00:55:50,340
True.

808
00:55:50,340 --> 00:55:51,340
It's like, yeah.

809
00:55:51,340 --> 00:55:52,660
I'll tell a lie to prove this.

810
00:55:52,660 --> 00:55:53,660
Ready?

811
00:55:53,660 --> 00:55:54,660
Okay.

812
00:55:54,660 --> 00:55:55,660
Tell a lie.

813
00:55:55,660 --> 00:55:57,060
I hate my friends.

814
00:55:57,060 --> 00:56:00,260
Your nose has never looked bigger, honestly.

815
00:56:00,260 --> 00:56:01,260
What?

816
00:56:01,260 --> 00:56:02,980
It looks fucking huge right now.

817
00:56:02,980 --> 00:56:04,380
No, I don't believe you.

818
00:56:04,380 --> 00:56:05,380
What the fuck?

819
00:56:05,380 --> 00:56:06,380
Dude, listen to this.

820
00:56:06,380 --> 00:56:07,380
Okay.

821
00:56:07,380 --> 00:56:08,380
You got like a snape nose right now.

822
00:56:08,380 --> 00:56:09,380
Listen to their test.

823
00:56:09,380 --> 00:56:10,380
Snape?

824
00:56:10,380 --> 00:56:11,380
Yeah.

825
00:56:11,380 --> 00:56:13,380
I think you mean Voldemort.

826
00:56:13,380 --> 00:56:17,380
No, Voldemort. No, that's a big ass nose you got there, dude. That's a sniffer.

827
00:56:17,380 --> 00:56:21,380
Listen how they tested how people's nose would shrink.

828
00:56:21,380 --> 00:56:26,380
In the study, the team used thermal imaging on 60 students as they completed a number of tasks.

829
00:56:26,380 --> 00:56:30,380
This included placing a phone call, during which they had to tell a close friend a significant lie.

830
00:56:30,380 --> 00:56:37,380
Meanwhile, a control group watched distressing videos of car accidents, which they had to explain to someone over the phone.

831
00:56:37,380 --> 00:56:39,380
What?

832
00:56:39,380 --> 00:56:44,740
So that just means a car, talking about car accidents gives you maybe a big nose.

833
00:56:44,740 --> 00:56:47,460
Yeah, I don't think

834
00:56:47,460 --> 00:56:49,460
I don't know what the car accidents have to do with anything.

835
00:56:49,460 --> 00:56:55,900
Did you guys see that humongous pile up in Texas with a hundred cars?

836
00:56:55,900 --> 00:56:57,900
Oh, yeah, the 50, I thought it was a 50, it was a hundred?

837
00:56:57,900 --> 00:56:59,900
No, over a hundred cars just ran.

838
00:56:59,900 --> 00:57:01,900
There was probably 50 and then people just kept running into it, dude.

839
00:57:01,900 --> 00:57:03,900
Those fucking idiots.

840
00:57:03,900 --> 00:57:05,900
They don't know what to do when there's like a quarter of an inch of snow on the ground.

841
00:57:05,900 --> 00:57:07,900
Oh, it's because it snowed in Texas?

842
00:57:07,900 --> 00:57:12,620
because it snowed in Texas it was like icy or something I thought that's so cool

843
00:57:12,620 --> 00:57:18,820
so with if there's 50 cars on the road yeah yeah five killed you can't oh and

844
00:57:18,820 --> 00:57:26,020
that don't know yeah did I know any of them it says it's Fort Worth could be

845
00:57:26,020 --> 00:57:30,180
Thomas Thomas no well I think he sent it to me but that would be funny if he sent

846
00:57:30,180 --> 00:57:35,500
it to me while he was driving yeah look at this a hundred fucking cars piled up

847
00:57:35,500 --> 00:57:40,620
and then he died. Wait, that's random. I just said that there was a

848
00:57:40,620 --> 00:57:44,180
hundred car pileup. There's a hundred cars in front of me right now. Oh well, I'm

849
00:57:44,180 --> 00:57:53,500
gonna drive closer to get a better look. There's 99 cars! Look at this fucking 99 car pileup!

850
00:57:53,500 --> 00:57:57,580
Imagine if the guy, one of the people who died was the 100th car.

851
00:57:57,580 --> 00:58:01,980
Can you imagine how awful that would feel? Because that guy definitely saw it coming.

852
00:58:01,980 --> 00:58:06,740
Yeah. Like he should have been able to avoid being the hundredth car. Yeah. Yeah.

853
00:58:06,740 --> 00:58:10,420
Well that guy saw it was like, "Oh there's 99 cars." I mean. Yeah. What's one more?

854
00:58:10,420 --> 00:58:16,300
Might as well. Yeah. Maybe they were filming Jackass 3. More from Times of India. Blue Rice is the

855
00:58:16,300 --> 00:58:21,620
latest craze that is Insta-worthy too. Blue Rice? Blue Rice. I don't want to know

856
00:58:21,620 --> 00:58:28,820
Avatar Rice. I ain't no Smurf. Blue, let's see here, Blue Rice. Wow. Is it a health food?

857
00:58:28,820 --> 00:58:38,200
Even the actress Jacqueline Fernandez was seen indulging in this dish along with her friends.

858
00:58:38,200 --> 00:58:39,760
What is it made out of?

859
00:58:39,760 --> 00:58:40,760
Blue.

860
00:58:40,760 --> 00:58:45,540
But oh my god, it started auto-playing an Indian ad really loud.

861
00:58:45,540 --> 00:58:51,240
Thai blue rice, the blue color of the rice comes from the petals of the clitora tornado.

862
00:58:51,240 --> 00:58:52,880
I will not be eating that.

863
00:58:52,880 --> 00:58:55,600
It says butterfly pea flowers.

864
00:58:55,600 --> 00:58:57,960
Butterfly pea.

865
00:58:57,960 --> 00:59:02,600
why it's the clitoris because it comes that's where the pee comes out yeah

866
00:59:02,600 --> 00:59:06,920
exactly like a woman's clitoris mm-hmm there's a tiny little hole that's why

867
00:59:06,920 --> 00:59:11,480
