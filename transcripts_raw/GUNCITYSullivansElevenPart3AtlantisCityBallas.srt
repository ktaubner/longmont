00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,000
[music]

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:15,000
So, after we determined that we needed the blueprints to the I-Cup facility,

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:22,000
we met with that architect, John Architect, who then told us to go to the Black Rock Development and Real Estate Association building

4
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
where we managed to retrieve the blueprints.

5
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,000
The other items we need to gather in the next 5 days are

6
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:39,000
1) A way to perform a successful biometric scan matching Fatima Von Kissyface, the head of the ICUP facility

7
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
2) Quantum crypto credentials that we can use to download the funds

8
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:49,000
3) Love Slime that Barry Gee can use to build a bomb to blow up the vault

9
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:54,000
and golden bullets that Travis Ocelot can use to disable security system in the facility.

10
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
We're gonna need at least the quantum cryptokronidges probably,

11
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
but without the other items though, this will be tough either way.

12
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
After barely making it back,

13
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
without alerting every officer on the Jollibee Fort,

14
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
and almost losing all of my blood

15
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:15,000
to a reimagining of a children's toy as a security guard,

16
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
we were greeted by none other than Mommy Goodlands.

17
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Me and my three best friends knew her from our time as private investigators.

18
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Back then, she sort of played us a bit.

19
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Not being honest with us about being controlled by Papi Chuko,

20
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
that she knew about the Calculus Rift,

21
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:37,000
that, you know, she wasn't being honest about Papi Chuko because she knew about that,

22
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
that she had a former business relationship with him,

23
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,000
that sending us into the Matrix 2 was almost certainly going to lead to our deaths,

24
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
but allow her a chance to escape.

25
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Other than that, she's great

26
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:56,000
And it also seems that well, she looks pregnant. So that's I guess good for her. But what was she here for?

27
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,320
And so yeah, mommy good legs has showed up at your door

28
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:04,080
She last you heard escaped south

29
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:08,960
away from gun City after all everything that fell out of

30
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:12,120
fill out of control the end of the

31
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:14,980
Broad City the uncle's Falcon Ark

32
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:22,760
And now she's back and she sees you all and she says hello boys

33
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:31,620
You became so fat to me

34
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:36,920
Can I see if I can hear the baby kick from the back? I put my finger in your belly button

35
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:42,560
To do an experiment on your baby

36
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:45,600
It looks like you ate a balloon

37
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:47,600
*laughter*

38
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:50,600
Good to see you haven't lost any of your charms.

39
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:52,600
Do you bounce?

40
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:54,600
*laughter*

41
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:56,600
We have to test if you bounce.

42
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:59,600
Please, please don't test if I bounce.

43
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:01,600
Get over! Bounce on the ground!

44
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:03,600
Bounce. Bounce.

45
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:05,600
Bounce. Now. Bounce.

46
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:10,600
I know you could do this to most of the other NPCs in the game, but I'm not gonna bounce.

47
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:13,600
I'll fuckin' kill your baby, I don't care.

48
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:28,080
a

49
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:30,080
'Cause he put a baby in her

50
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:32,080
Alright, let's hear him out, but Sullivan has to go in the other-

51
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:34,080
Let's hear her out, 'cause Sullivan has to go in the other room.

52
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:36,080
'Cause, uh...

53
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:38,080
He's- he's eyein' her weird.

54
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:42,080
Do you guys mean that?

55
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:44,080
I think you're right.

56
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:46,080
Do I have to go in the other room too?

57
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:48,080
I think Sullivan's in her belly.

58
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:50,080
We need you if shit goes south with this baby.

59
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:54,080
What do I do if shit goes south with the baby?

60
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:56,080
You kill the- you kill her.

61
00:03:56,080 --> 00:04:06,600
her. Okay, what's her name? What's going on? So yeah, very key and Travis, you probably

62
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:18,640
both wouldn't necessarily know. Travis, maybe we don't know. I don't know. Yeah. Yeah. So

63
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:23,560
she was just like, she was like in the first gun city arc. She was the which was sort of

64
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:38,440
the

65
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:51,400
the

66
00:04:51,400 --> 00:05:03,760
the

67
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:06,060
that too. Yes, you do.

68
00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:08,360
That's what I didn't say that.

69
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:10,460
Yeah, no.

70
00:05:10,460 --> 00:05:16,760
So yeah, very key.

71
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:19,760
You probably don't you probably don't know her.

72
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:22,160
I mean, maybe you do. I don't know.

73
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:24,360
You've been around a while.

74
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:26,860
She did own a famous nightclub

75
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:29,960
that then belong now belongs to Jamal the worm.

76
00:05:30,860 --> 00:05:48,860
and

77
00:05:48,860 --> 00:05:52,040
And, uh, she says to you all, um,

78
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:54,440
well,

79
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:59,360
your break in into the black rock building,

80
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:04,080
I was noticed by one of the young men who's been working for me for some

81
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:08,080
time. You see, uh, he was there as well,

82
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:12,720
retrieving something from, for myself, the way I see it.

83
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:14,760
I don't know what you guys are up to,

84
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:41,920
the

85
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:43,920
the

86
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:49,760
the

87
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:56,760
the

88
00:06:56,760 --> 00:07:02,840
we got a steal? Yeah, what are you gonna do, burp and fart? Oh, that was a good one. Wait.

89
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:10,480
That gives me an idea. What if we hid in your big fat belly? And you walked into the to

90
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:19,920
this? What is it? The store? That could actually work, I think. Money store. Well, I guess

91
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:33,140
this

92
00:07:33,140 --> 00:07:37,320
But I offer some information, and then you guys can tell me what you're up to.

93
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:38,320
Does that sound alright?

94
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:41,320
Yeah, I guess, but we won't be listening.

95
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:44,920
We'll be playing video games.

96
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:48,760
All the better for me, I suppose.

97
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:57,960
I had a gentleman go in there and look into another building that was developed recently

98
00:07:57,960 --> 00:08:00,960
under one of poppy chukos pseudonyms

99
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:03,960
which concerns me because i-

100
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:04,760
what?

101
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:06,960
was it choopy poppy?

102
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:09,660
it wasn't choopy poppy it was...

103
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:11,560
i wrote this down

104
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:14,060
okay...

105
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:15,260
do we have to-

106
00:08:15,260 --> 00:08:17,260
do we have to listen to all of this?

107
00:08:17,260 --> 00:08:19,960
*laughs*

108
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:22,760
you could certainly tune me out like blotas is

109
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:24,060
who's playing video games

110
00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:26,260
like what game are you playing blotas?

111
00:08:26,260 --> 00:08:27,860
i don't know

112
00:08:27,860 --> 00:08:29,860
*laughter*

113
00:08:29,860 --> 00:08:31,860
I just don't wanna listen.

114
00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:33,100
*laughter*

115
00:08:33,100 --> 00:08:35,100
I'm playing a game called "Controller Wars"

116
00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:37,100
I throw the controller at my friends.

117
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:39,100
*laughter*

118
00:08:39,100 --> 00:08:41,100
The point is, is that

119
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:44,360
I'm concerned that Papi Chuko's still alive.

120
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:45,620
He might not be.

121
00:08:45,620 --> 00:08:47,620
Might be somebody else, but

122
00:08:47,620 --> 00:08:49,620
Choopy Papi.

123
00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:51,620
Didn't I punch his head off of his body?

124
00:08:51,620 --> 00:08:53,620
Well, that's right, but

125
00:08:53,620 --> 00:08:56,860
you know, we have enough money. There's a lot of things you can do in Gun City.

126
00:08:56,860 --> 00:09:09,300
the

127
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:14,180
That's fine. Is he alive or dead? I think he's dead, but he could be alive.

128
00:09:14,180 --> 00:09:21,620
Look. I don't care about this anymore. Okay, yeah, listen, listen, bitch.

129
00:09:21,620 --> 00:09:27,220
You better have that baby right now or get the hell out of here.

130
00:09:27,220 --> 00:09:33,380
I want to see what's inside of her. I hope the baby's a frog. I'm gonna

131
00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:38,900
I'm gonna roll insight to see like, cause she kind of betrayed us before I want to see if she's uh

132
00:09:38,900 --> 00:09:42,180
Yeah what do you want, what specifically are you trying to read into?

133
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:45,180
Um, well I, it seems like

134
00:09:45,180 --> 00:09:48,980
Like a part of her story or, or, or um, yeah sorry go on

135
00:09:48,980 --> 00:09:58,380
I guess the fact that she like noticed we were stealing something and then came to us because of that seems fishy

136
00:09:58,380 --> 00:10:01,780
that maybe like she is trying to get us caught or something

137
00:10:01,780 --> 00:10:07,040
So I want to search for evil intentions in her brain. Yeah camera, that's amazing

138
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:10,700
That's the 13 you have a mind reading ability and you don't know

139
00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:14,820
I was gonna use it after

140
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:19,340
Okay. Yeah 13. I mean from what you can glean and you know

141
00:10:19,340 --> 00:10:23,840
Obviously mommy good legs is a pretty practiced con

142
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:30,500
Artist to some some extent but from what you can glean with the 13. She seems to be her attention seemed to be

143
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:46,960
the

144
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:59,340
the

145
00:10:59,340 --> 00:11:11,780
the

146
00:11:11,780 --> 00:11:24,360
the

147
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:26,860
the

148
00:11:26,860 --> 00:11:29,040
the

149
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:31,140
the

150
00:11:31,140 --> 00:11:33,340
the

151
00:11:33,340 --> 00:11:35,540
the

152
00:11:35,540 --> 00:11:37,740
the

153
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:39,940
the

154
00:11:39,940 --> 00:11:41,940
I'm gonna try and make her water break.

155
00:11:41,940 --> 00:11:43,940
*laughter*

156
00:11:43,940 --> 00:11:45,940
Through poking her.

157
00:11:45,940 --> 00:11:47,940
Uh huh.

158
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:51,940
It's just not gonna make my water break, Patrick.

159
00:11:51,940 --> 00:11:53,940
You're doing an ath-

160
00:11:53,940 --> 00:11:55,940
I saw a butterfly outside.

161
00:11:55,940 --> 00:11:57,940
You're doing an athletics check?

162
00:11:57,940 --> 00:11:59,940
You're rolling athletics, Patrick?

163
00:11:59,940 --> 00:12:00,940
Yep.

164
00:12:00,940 --> 00:12:01,940
What are you doing?

165
00:12:01,940 --> 00:12:03,940
I'm trying to make the water break.

166
00:12:03,940 --> 00:12:05,940
Yeah, you just sort of

167
00:12:05,940 --> 00:12:07,940
poke her stomach continually.

168
00:12:07,940 --> 00:12:11,300
it's not gonna make the... it's not even where the... it's not like where the water...

169
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:13,140
is...

170
00:12:13,140 --> 00:12:16,940
where is the water, Patches?

171
00:12:16,940 --> 00:12:19,740
I don't know, isn't it like lower than that?

172
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:21,540
can you tell me where the water is?

173
00:12:21,540 --> 00:12:22,040
so I can...

174
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:23,040
where is the water?

175
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:24,540
isn't the water lower than that?

176
00:12:24,540 --> 00:12:26,040
you're such an expert

177
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:27,240
where's your water?

178
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:29,940
where's your water?

179
00:12:29,940 --> 00:12:30,540
hmm

180
00:12:30,540 --> 00:12:32,540
googled "where is the water"

181
00:12:32,540 --> 00:12:36,140
getting a lot of swimming schools

182
00:12:37,540 --> 00:12:42,100
the water tower bar

183
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:43,980
doesn't matter so

184
00:12:43,980 --> 00:12:47,500
uh... that's what you can clean from doing an insight check though camp so

185
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:48,180
yeah

186
00:12:48,180 --> 00:12:51,020
yeah i mean is normal

187
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:55,300
we can tell you i see if she's lying about being pregnant

188
00:12:55,300 --> 00:12:57,660
uh... you certainly could be a

189
00:12:57,660 --> 00:12:59,660
i mean that's

190
00:12:59,660 --> 00:13:03,980
i don't know i guess it's a medicine check really is what that is

191
00:13:03,980 --> 00:13:05,980
So keep that rolling.

192
00:13:05,980 --> 00:13:07,980
She's not pregnant.

193
00:13:07,980 --> 00:13:13,980
I mean, yeah, I mean, she gave you some information.

194
00:13:13,980 --> 00:13:17,980
She was wondering if you would give her information in return

195
00:13:17,980 --> 00:13:20,980
and see if she can help you or you can help her.

196
00:13:20,980 --> 00:13:22,980
You certainly don't have to.

197
00:13:22,980 --> 00:13:24,980
You can just refuse her help.

198
00:13:24,980 --> 00:13:26,980
What information do you want from us?

199
00:13:26,980 --> 00:13:28,980
What did she get out of it?

200
00:13:28,980 --> 00:13:30,980
Does she want a cut?

201
00:13:30,980 --> 00:13:32,980
Can I study her belly?

202
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:42,940

203
00:13:42,940 --> 00:13:44,940
the

204
00:13:44,940 --> 00:13:46,940
the

205
00:13:46,940 --> 00:13:48,940
the

206
00:13:48,940 --> 00:13:50,940
the

207
00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:52,940
the

208
00:13:52,940 --> 00:13:54,940
the

209
00:13:54,940 --> 00:13:56,940
the

210
00:13:56,940 --> 00:13:58,940
the

211
00:13:58,940 --> 00:14:00,940
the

212
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:02,940
the

213
00:14:02,940 --> 00:14:04,940
the

214
00:14:04,940 --> 00:14:06,940
the

215
00:14:06,940 --> 00:14:08,940
the

216
00:14:08,940 --> 00:14:10,940

Why we are here.

You tell Santa all about it.

221
00:14:38,740 --> 00:14:39,980
Do you really?

222
00:14:39,980 --> 00:14:40,980
Okay.

223
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:41,980
Do you really?

224
00:14:41,980 --> 00:14:43,700
I guess Sullivan just explains it.

225
00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:44,700
He explains the situation.

226
00:14:44,700 --> 00:14:45,700
Explains what?

227
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:52,260
So he needs to be, he needs to be kind of bashful and embarrassed.

228
00:14:52,260 --> 00:14:53,260
As he's explaining it?

229
00:14:53,260 --> 00:14:54,260
Do you want me to?

230
00:14:54,260 --> 00:14:55,260
Yeah.

231
00:14:55,260 --> 00:14:56,260
Do you just want me to do it?

232
00:14:56,260 --> 00:14:57,260
Okay.

233
00:14:57,260 --> 00:14:58,260
And he needs to cry.

234
00:14:58,260 --> 00:14:59,260
Okay.

235
00:14:59,260 --> 00:15:00,260
Well, uh.

240
00:15:17,860 --> 00:15:21,900

00:15:21,900 --> 00:15:27,440
Okay, you're trying to get money back from a charity. Yeah. Yes

242
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:30,220
No

243
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:32,780
Do you have gold bullets

244
00:15:32,780 --> 00:15:36,900
No

245
00:15:36,900 --> 00:15:51,140

246
00:15:51,140 --> 00:15:52,780
So where do I go?

247
00:15:52,780 --> 00:15:53,780
You have a baby.

248
00:15:53,780 --> 00:16:03,300
I'll give you that information if I can get your assurance that when I need you and I

249
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:06,420
call upon you, you'll come.

250
00:16:06,420 --> 00:16:07,420
Well for what?

251
00:16:07,420 --> 00:16:08,420
We're just gonna say yeah.

252
00:16:08,420 --> 00:16:11,340
I don't know how to deliver a baby.

253
00:16:11,340 --> 00:16:14,340
I'm not gonna help you with that if that's what you're asking.

254
00:16:14,340 --> 00:16:17,180
I could do that.

255
00:16:17,180 --> 00:16:19,780
You can deliver a baby or you're going to accept what I'm saying?

256
00:16:19,780 --> 00:16:21,220
I can deliver a baby.

257
00:16:21,220 --> 00:16:22,660
We'll do whatever you say whenever you want.

258
00:16:22,660 --> 00:16:23,780
Yeah, whatever, I don't care.

259
00:16:23,780 --> 00:16:28,500
I got, I got, uh, all the, I got, I got the force or whatever.

260
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:29,300
I don't know.

261
00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:32,260
Okay, but it can't be, it can't be like ridiculous or stupid.

262
00:16:32,260 --> 00:16:34,580
Like it has just, so just make it something normal.

263
00:16:34,580 --> 00:16:35,140
Okay.

264
00:16:35,140 --> 00:16:37,140
It can't be like a, like a test.

265
00:16:37,140 --> 00:16:39,300
Yeah, we can't, you can't be like tricking us right now.

266
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:40,020
Okay.

267
00:16:40,020 --> 00:16:41,060
It's not a trick.

268
00:16:41,060 --> 00:16:43,140
It's just, I don't know what I'll need to get done.

269
00:16:43,140 --> 00:16:44,100
What I need to get done.

270
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:45,300
Right.

271
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:48,900
And if it's more than 10 minutes from now, the deal's off.

272
00:16:49,620 --> 00:17:04,400
the

273
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:24,120
okay guys smile she goes okay are you familiar with the Cabrera sisters

274
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:32,520
mmm yeah Tamara mm-hmm close Mary Kate and Ashley Cabrera they were cyborgs

275
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:38,640
you work for the Mad Suckla, who now have the territory divided up at the slums.

276
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:43,120
If you go to the slums, I'm sure somebody there can point you in the right direction

277
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:49,560
if you just have to encounter one of the many runners that are on there, that are down there,

278
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:54,000
figure out which one of them knows the information, you can shake them down.

279
00:17:54,000 --> 00:18:01,120
Specifically if you go to a particular territory, I'll mark it on your map here, and she marks

280
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:12,600
it

281
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:25,040
the

282
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:32,040
the

283
00:18:32,040 --> 00:19:01,800
the

284
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:14,480
the

285
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:29,520
the

286
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:33,280
Oh my god. Okay, I'll give you a cut.

287
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:35,280
Yeah, I'll cut the baby out.

288
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:37,280
I'm going to give you a cysterian section.

289
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:40,640
I'm going to use a Jedi mind trick right now.

290
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:42,640
She doesn't know how much money we're going to steal, right?

291
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:44,640
We can just sell her that.

292
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:46,640
Yeah, we will give you half of it.

293
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:48,640
Yeah, we're going to give you all of it, actually.

294
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:50,640
No, half.

295
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:52,640
You want to have your baby right now.

296
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:54,640
You're offering half before I say what I want.

297
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:56,640
Okay, what do you want?

298
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:58,640
I want to have my baby.

299
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:00,640
Okay, what do you want?

300
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:02,640
Now I want half

301
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:04,640
You have half, you get it

302
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:06,640
You're gonna have half

303
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:08,640
Roll deception

304
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:12,640
You're gonna be so embarrassed about how little money we are trying to steal

305
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:16,640
Do you get advantage though, Travis?

306
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:18,640
After you roll deception

307
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:20,640
I roll deception then

308
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:22,640
My thing is a loading

309
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:24,640
Why am I deception so low?

310
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:26,640
God damn

311
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:28,640
Goddamn because it's tied to

312
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:33,340
Your charisma, which is weirdly low, but you get advantage so you get to roll again

313
00:20:33,340 --> 00:20:36,080
Yes

314
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:42,740
You're right on all deception checks time to trick the expecting mother

315
00:20:42,740 --> 00:20:49,880
That was a six

316
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:54,160
Okay, she says

317
00:20:55,360 --> 00:21:00,880
Look if you can't give me a half a quarter just a quarter then I

318
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:04,160
Got a quarter right here. And that's all the same

319
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:11,040
Quarter. Yeah quarters. Yeah quarter for sure. You'll get a quarter of it. I guess she thinks she won

320
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:15,560
You know what you'll get you'll get 75%

321
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:21,800
All right, fellas shake on it

322
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:36,200
the

323
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:50,080
the

324
00:21:50,080 --> 00:22:05,080
and

325
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:11,320
credentials now I can go into details for this but I think we're done I think

326
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:16,720
we should go to the slums yeah so I think it's slum time do you think so I need to

327
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:22,480
be there right now okay all right but first let's let's sort of fan the smell

328
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:29,480
of her farts out of the room yeah we need to do it like a sage cleanse so that

329
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:32,480
the baby spirit isn't hanging around in here.

330
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:35,480
Okay, you're gonna do a sage cleanse?

331
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:36,480
No, let's go to slums.

332
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:37,480
Athletics for the sage.

333
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:38,480
My core, yeah.

334
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:39,480
Okay, cool, yeah.

335
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:40,480
Athletics?

336
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:41,480
Yeah.

337
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:44,320
So yeah, you guys head to the slums.

338
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:48,560
You guys would know about Mary Kay and Ashley Herrera, because you guys did meet them very

339
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:52,840
briefly when you were in the Mad Suckler's den.

340
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:57,920
The slums have been constantly warring for some time, though with the Mad Suckler's death,

341
00:22:57,920 --> 00:23:02,520
you know, by the hands of Papi Chuko.

342
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:07,120
Now the Cabrera sisters sort of divided up, betrayed the Sucklist, divided up his territory,

343
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:13,040
control the Techno Slime market and are kind of an arm for many of the businesses in the

344
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:15,040
city.

345
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:18,720
And while Papi Chuko's company is sort of cycling through CEOs, can't really get their

346
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:22,440
shit together, they still shirk the kind of criminal, they sort of shirk the criminal

347
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:25,680
warlords, they don't have the discretion or craftiness of the Sucklist.

348
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:30,960
So they've kind of just been sucking the slums dry of all instead of, you know, sort of distributing

349
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:35,520
that kind of the pain that you can distribute when you're running a criminal enterprise.

350
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:39,920
And so it's kind of like the buffer that you would normally have of having a slums that's

351
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:43,840
indebted to you is kind of gone here. It's a little bit more lawless than from the last

352
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:48,240
time you were here. A lot more, a lot more.

353
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:50,240
There's no laws?

354
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:51,240
What?

355
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:52,240
There's no laws here?

356
00:23:52,240 --> 00:24:22,200
is

357
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:24,200
the trash can and I try again.

358
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:25,200
Okay.

359
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:27,200
Roll another athletics check.

360
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:28,200
Ten.

361
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:29,200
Ten, okay.

362
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:33,040
You get like the same spot and you just dent it in a little bit more.

363
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:36,360
And then at that point now you see somebody, he sort of like pops their head out of the

364
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:37,360
window of a building.

365
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:39,880
He goes, "What the fuck are you doing?!"

366
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:41,560
I throw the trash can at him.

367
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:43,160
Alright, he's pretty high up.

368
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:44,160
Roll athletics though.

369
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:45,160
Nine.

370
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:51,080
You just, you throw it on the top of the car, and it just bounces on the other side of the

371
00:24:51,080 --> 00:24:52,080
car.

372
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:52,580
What the fuck?

373
00:24:52,580 --> 00:24:55,220
And he sort of, he shuts his window and he goes downstairs.

374
00:24:55,220 --> 00:24:56,400
You hear him go downstairs.

375
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:57,900
You hear him come to you.

376
00:24:57,900 --> 00:24:59,420
Uh, he comes outside.

377
00:24:59,420 --> 00:25:01,420
And he starts to square up with you, Patrick Yoda.

378
00:25:01,420 --> 00:25:03,420
It's just, just a regular guy.

379
00:25:03,420 --> 00:25:06,460
I pick up the trash can and try to throw it at him again.

380
00:25:06,460 --> 00:25:09,200
Okay, he's gonna try to stop you from doing this.

381
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:10,700
So he is standing in front of you.

382
00:25:10,700 --> 00:25:12,340
I point both of my guns at him.

383
00:25:12,340 --> 00:25:14,340
Oh no, stay out of this.

384
00:25:14,340 --> 00:25:16,940
Let him, let Patrick deal with this.

385
00:25:16,940 --> 00:25:18,940
Don't be an asshole, let me do this!

386
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:27,400
the

387
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:31,480
involved anymore. I was gonna show you a trick, look, and then I start juggling the guns.

388
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:39,720
Um, all right, I'm just gonna, you know what, just, just, um, I'll move my, I'll move my,

389
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:45,800
do you know any criminals? Fucking no, I'm just, I don't know, are you a criminal?

390
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:50,200
You literally came down here to try to pick a fight with a guy who was doing,

391
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:55,720
basically nothing, destroying my car. I bet you've called the cops on at least one guy.

392
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:58,760
You know what the trash barrel can at the car

393
00:25:58,760 --> 00:26:05,820
19 goes through the driver's seat window. I asked him to give us all the information we need. Yeah

394
00:26:05,820 --> 00:26:13,320
What you want to know just please stop throwing the fucking drug where is the water in a woman's baby?

395
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:20,560
Yeah, we want to know where to buy golden bullets and we want to know

396
00:26:20,560 --> 00:26:27,560
*multiple people talking at once*

397
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:29,560
*multiple people talking at once*

398
00:26:29,560 --> 00:26:31,560
*multiple people talking at once*

399
00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:33,560
*multiple people talking at once*

400
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:35,560
*multiple people talking at once*

401
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:37,560
*multiple people talking at once*

402
00:26:37,560 --> 00:26:39,560
*multiple people talking at once*

403
00:26:39,560 --> 00:26:41,560
*multiple people talking at once*

404
00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:43,560
*multiple people talking at once*

405
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:45,560
*multiple people talking at once*

406
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:47,560
*multiple people talking at once*

407
00:26:47,560 --> 00:26:49,560
*multiple people talking at once*

408
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:53,560
I don't know what the fuck you're talking about, Golden Bullets, I don't, I don't...

409
00:26:53,560 --> 00:26:57,560
Yes or no question, who is the worst person in the whole area?

410
00:26:57,560 --> 00:27:02,060
Oh, that's actually a good question.

411
00:27:02,060 --> 00:27:04,060
Uh, that was me, the DM.

412
00:27:04,060 --> 00:27:07,560
Um, uh, uh, well, I...

413
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:09,560
*sigh*

414
00:27:09,560 --> 00:27:11,060
Dougie Freeze?

415
00:27:11,060 --> 00:27:14,560
Okay, we're going to kill him now. Goodbye.

416
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:15,560
Where did you live?

417
00:27:15,560 --> 00:27:17,560
No, no, no, just, just, just, uh...

418
00:27:17,560 --> 00:27:20,600
We're gonna tell him that you told us to do it.

419
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:21,100
Fuck you!

420
00:27:21,100 --> 00:27:26,800
We will tell his whole family, especially if he has like brothers, that it was all your fault.

421
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:30,200
Yeah, if he has a kid, we're gonna tell the kid that it's your fault.

422
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:36,500
Unless you tell us who the second worst person in the whole entire area is and where we can find him.

423
00:27:36,500 --> 00:27:38,500
And if I can take your car radio.

424
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:42,700
Don't, why you...

425
00:27:42,700 --> 00:27:47,000
I don't know who the second worst person is.

426
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,000
Can I have the car radio?

427
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:52,000
The guy who runs the bodega down the block, he sucks.

428
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:57,000
That's all, I mean, Dougie Freeze is the worst guy, probably anybody who works under him.

429
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,000
Okay, okay.

430
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,000
You're avoiding my question.

431
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,000
I'm not taking my fucking car radio.

432
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,000
How would you get the car radio out of the car?

433
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,000
Hmm?

434
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000
What are you gonna do with a car radio?

435
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,000
Listen to music.

436
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,000
Okay.

437
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:13,000
What are you gonna plug it into? Not my computer ass.

438
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:18,540
I have I have a hoverboard that has no radio and I wanted to put a radio in it

439
00:28:18,540 --> 00:28:20,920
just

440
00:28:20,920 --> 00:28:22,920
Fucking get your own

441
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:24,940
Why are you destroying my life?

442
00:28:24,940 --> 00:28:28,220
Maybe because we don't have any money because we accidentally

443
00:28:28,220 --> 00:28:33,000
Donated all of it to a charity that we're trying to steal it back from I gave you what you I'm go

444
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:39,320

445
00:28:39,320 --> 00:28:41,320
Oh, he runs about

446
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:49,340
Where is Dougie Freeze? He doesn't know I don't know where he is. He's just fucking around. He's just a bad guy

447
00:28:49,340 --> 00:28:51,340
Who's around a neighbor?

448
00:28:51,340 --> 00:28:54,040
Okay, go to the bodega, but you have

449
00:28:54,040 --> 00:28:58,980

Okay, okay go into the bodega then okay, yeah and I get your car radio I

452
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:20,800

Yeah, you guys want to go to the you guys want to go to the bodega then? Yeah

455
00:29:30,520 --> 00:29:35,160
He's the same. I know he might know where this okay

456
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:40,880
I'm gonna be screaming Dougie freezes name the whole time. I'm walking in the bodega. Mm-hmm. Yeah

457
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:59,560

What the fuck you say to me?

466
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:35,840
Get the fuck out of here.

467
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:36,840
Freeze.

468
00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:37,840
I don't know what to say.

469
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:40,440
This guy right here, this guy in front of me, he wants to fight him.

470
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:42,720
No, buddy, put your fucking gun away.

471
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:43,720
Freeze.

472
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:44,720
What the fuck?

473
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:45,720
And he goes, we are the police.

474
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:47,360
And he reaches below the counter and he pulls out a shotgun.

475
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:49,760
He goes, fucking fuck off.

476
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:52,080
I put the barrel of the gun in my mouth.

477
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:53,080
I'm sorry.

478
00:30:53,080 --> 00:30:54,080

Intimidation check with advantage.

Go for it.

484
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:06,920

00:31:09,920 --> 00:31:11,560
There's no way this isn't gonna work.

489
00:31:11,560 --> 00:31:12,560
With advantage?

490
00:31:12,560 --> 00:31:13,560

00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:43,520
I'd say the sleight of hand, you got away with that with that 11.

529
00:33:43,520 --> 00:33:45,520
He's fucking frazzled as hell.

530
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:47,520
Like he's not noticing someone calmly putting a bomb

531
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:49,520
on a cash register.

532
00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:51,520
I asked him if he knows where to buy gold bullets.

533
00:33:51,520 --> 00:33:53,520
He's not even

534
00:33:53,520 --> 00:33:55,520
close to like a human

535
00:33:55,520 --> 00:34:12,520
in

536
00:34:12,520 --> 00:34:24,880
the

537
00:34:24,880 --> 00:34:26,880
We're ready go to the fucking casino

538
00:34:26,880 --> 00:34:35,960
He has a lot of money it is cash free as his cash register he is not called Dougie free

539
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:45,440
Can I do an investigation check to see if maybe he has a Rolodex or something with with Dougie freeze his phone number yeah for sure

540
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:49,040

543
00:34:55,680 --> 00:35:02,400
It's got like has like, you know different initials and a number next to it and DF is one of them with a number next to it

544
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:06,960
That you would assume would be Dougie freeze which someone he probably has to

545
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:13,120
Give money to or something. Okay. I I'm gonna grab his phone. I'm guessing he has a phone somewhere

546
00:35:13,120 --> 00:35:19,440
Yeah, he had a phone on him. You can take his phone. I'm gonna dial Dougie for Dougie freezes number

I could probably do

550
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:38,440
That makes sense you're about as worthless as that fucking fat Greek piece of shit here

551
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:41,440

And he, Hulk Sulvin hangs up.

567
00:36:55,620 --> 00:36:57,620
He's like, I'm still a girl.

568
00:36:57,620 --> 00:36:59,620
You're not a girl.

569
00:36:59,620 --> 00:37:01,620
I'm not done being a girl yet.

570
00:37:01,620 --> 00:37:03,620
I'm hitting, I hit him with my pipe.

571
00:37:03,620 --> 00:37:05,620
To the side of the head.

572
00:37:05,620 --> 00:37:07,620
He.

573
00:37:07,620 --> 00:37:09,620
You can roll an attack roll.

574
00:37:09,620 --> 00:37:20,620
Meet us at Dinero, a diner outside of Conchie's Palace, which is the main casino.

575
00:37:20,620 --> 00:37:23,620
Oh, you just hit 13 damage to Pat.

576
00:37:23,620 --> 00:37:26,620
Like, you just bl-b-b-brained him, basically.

577
00:37:26,620 --> 00:37:28,620
Is he still a girl?

578
00:37:28,620 --> 00:37:30,620
It's up to Pat, really, at this point.

579
00:37:30,620 --> 00:37:32,620
Where did you hit him?

580
00:37:32,620 --> 00:37:33,620
Oh, wow!

581
00:37:33,620 --> 00:37:34,620
Oh, he's normal.

582
00:37:34,620 --> 00:37:38,420
I was pretending to be a girl, but now I really am one

583
00:37:38,420 --> 00:37:51,980
That's too low you don't hit him, but he still lost a good amount of okay, that's gonna hit

584
00:37:51,980 --> 00:37:54,540
All right, we are

585
00:37:54,540 --> 00:37:57,200
Was 41 minus 24 where we are

586
00:37:57,200 --> 00:38:00,500
You're at 17

587
00:38:00,500 --> 00:38:02,500
I'm the bell of the ball!

588
00:38:02,500 --> 00:38:04,500
I'm the bell of the ball!

589
00:38:04,500 --> 00:38:06,500
Oh jeez!

590
00:38:06,500 --> 00:38:08,500
Stop hitting him, Scott!

591
00:38:08,500 --> 00:38:10,500
He's dead. He's dead. He's dead.

592
00:38:10,500 --> 00:38:12,500
He's dead. He's dead.

593
00:38:12,500 --> 00:38:14,500
He's dead. Pat, we're gonna have to roll initiative

594
00:38:14,500 --> 00:38:16,500
so Pat can roll death saving throws.

595
00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:18,500
Um...

596
00:38:18,500 --> 00:38:20,500
Okay...

597
00:38:20,500 --> 00:38:22,500
Let's just kill Pat.

598
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:24,500
[Laughter]

599
00:38:24,500 --> 00:38:26,500
Okay, uh...

600
00:38:26,500 --> 00:38:28,500
Thanks for letting me wait to roll initiative

601
00:38:28,500 --> 00:38:30,500
roll initiative until after I kill you.

602
00:38:30,500 --> 00:38:32,500
*laughter*

603
00:38:32,500 --> 00:38:34,500
*laughter*

604
00:38:34,500 --> 00:38:36,500
When you picked a clear side.

605
00:38:36,500 --> 00:38:38,500
Pat, roll a death saving throw.

606
00:38:38,500 --> 00:38:44,500
Okay, that's one failure.

607
00:38:44,500 --> 00:38:46,500
Alright, you guys wanna do- hold on, before you

608
00:38:46,500 --> 00:38:48,500
roll another one, do you guys wanna do anything to stop

609
00:38:48,500 --> 00:38:50,500
Pat from dying? Is he a girl?

610
00:38:50,500 --> 00:38:52,500
*laughter*

611
00:38:52,500 --> 00:38:54,500
I can't answer, I'm dead.

612
00:38:54,500 --> 00:38:56,500
How did you-

613
00:38:56,500 --> 00:39:00,000
Are you lying on the ground like, like, girlishly?

614
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,000
I don't know.

615
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,000
You look like the Black Dahlia.

616
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:07,000
There's no way to tell right now.

617
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:09,500
There is a way to tell, because you can tell us.

618
00:39:09,500 --> 00:39:12,000
How girlish are you right now?

619
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,000
I'm behind the counter, you can't see.

620
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,000
You're dead, we walked over there.

621
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:19,000
I'm peering over. Am I looking under your dress?

622
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:21,000
I grew a dress.

623
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:23,000
Easy girl, still. Let him die.

624
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:25,500
Alright, roll another death saving throw, Pat.

625
00:39:25,500 --> 00:39:32,500
Okay, it's two failures. Alright, this is the last chance. He'll actually die.

626
00:39:32,500 --> 00:39:36,500
Is he still wearing a dress?

627
00:39:36,500 --> 00:39:38,500
I give him health by healing him.

628
00:39:38,500 --> 00:39:40,500
Wow, I guess Travis likes girls.

629
00:39:40,500 --> 00:39:44,500
*laughter*

630
00:39:44,500 --> 00:39:46,500
Okay, yeah.

631
00:39:46,500 --> 00:39:48,500
That is the gayest thing I've ever seen, bro.

632
00:39:48,500 --> 00:39:50,500
You hug cooties, bro.

633
00:39:50,500 --> 00:39:52,500
Travis, roll a medicine check.

634
00:39:52,500 --> 00:39:54,500
Okay.

635
00:39:54,500 --> 00:40:05,540
but he has to be my girlfriend if I bring him back you have to get above a 10 to

636
00:40:05,540 --> 00:40:15,260
stabilize him okay take forever all right medicine my medicine is one that's a 9

637
00:40:15,260 --> 00:40:21,780
so he didn't stabilize him Pat roll another death saving throw 12 okay he's

638
00:40:21,780 --> 00:40:23,780
He's alive, he's so far so good.

639
00:40:23,780 --> 00:40:26,540
Pierce, you want to try to stabilize him again?

640
00:40:26,540 --> 00:40:30,340
I think I like him like this.

641
00:40:30,340 --> 00:40:32,060
Sullivan is going to try to stabilize him.

642
00:40:32,060 --> 00:40:34,580
I thought he did stabilize.

643
00:40:34,580 --> 00:40:35,580
Nope.

644
00:40:35,580 --> 00:40:37,380
No, I'm sorry.

645
00:40:37,380 --> 00:40:38,380
Sullivan's going to try.

646
00:40:38,380 --> 00:40:41,380
Sorry, I'm going to check.

647
00:40:41,380 --> 00:40:42,380
Okay.

648
00:40:42,380 --> 00:40:46,180
All right, Sullivan got a 17.

649
00:40:46,180 --> 00:40:47,580
Whoa!

650
00:40:47,580 --> 00:40:48,700
Sullivan stabilizes you.

651
00:40:48,700 --> 00:40:50,700
Okay, does anybody have potions for him or something?

652
00:40:50,700 --> 00:40:52,700
Cause he's just gonna be knocked out right now.

653
00:40:52,700 --> 00:40:54,700
No, I don't have anything.

654
00:40:54,700 --> 00:40:57,700
I would pick him up by the scruff of his neck with my chimp arm.

655
00:40:57,700 --> 00:40:59,700
And I'd pick him up on my back.

656
00:40:59,700 --> 00:41:05,700
Okay, we'll let you, Pat, get up to 1 HP by the time you get to Atlantis City.

657
00:41:05,700 --> 00:41:08,700
Um, you almost died.

658
00:41:08,700 --> 00:41:15,700
So yeah, you guys can go to Atlantis City, where you'll meet Dougie Freeze at the Dinero.

659
00:41:15,700 --> 00:41:30,700
the

660
00:41:30,700 --> 00:41:45,700
a

661
00:41:45,700 --> 00:41:48,540
at night. So it's kind of actually good timing. But the

662
00:41:48,540 --> 00:41:52,020
movers and shakers of the slums often go to Atlanta City. So

663
00:41:52,020 --> 00:41:55,060
that kind of makes sense. There's a couple games you can

664
00:41:55,060 --> 00:41:57,620
play here. If you go to conscious palace, we can talk

665
00:41:57,620 --> 00:42:02,740
about going to conscious palace. When you guys go in there, you

666
00:42:02,740 --> 00:42:05,620
get like a little like a bubble goes around your head so you can

667
00:42:05,620 --> 00:42:09,740
breathe. And it's as beautiful as you imagined Atlanta City to

668
00:42:09,740 --> 00:42:15,300
be you know, spires, just tons of just broke people from New

669
00:42:15,300 --> 00:42:22,260
Jersey. You know, beautiful gold paved roads, a couple of casino

670
00:42:22,260 --> 00:42:24,900
buildings. But yeah, what do you guys want to do? You're in

671
00:42:24,900 --> 00:42:26,300
Atlanta City is

672
00:42:26,300 --> 00:42:29,740
why first things first, we got to get my boy Patrick Yoda some

673
00:42:29,740 --> 00:42:30,620
hot dogs.

674
00:42:30,620 --> 00:42:35,780
There is a cold dogs and hot soda stand here. Of course,

675
00:42:35,780 --> 00:42:41,100
each cold dog heals only one HP so he has to eat like, like 40

676
00:42:41,100 --> 00:42:56,180
the

677
00:42:56,180 --> 00:43:02,560
a roll of 40 no so you're just gonna you're gonna have I roll to these

678
00:43:02,560 --> 00:43:09,980
bunnies and then whatever number shows up is how many hot dogs a is rolled yeah

679
00:43:09,980 --> 00:43:13,480
yeah I think that's actually not a bad idea I actually kind of like that yeah

680
00:43:13,480 --> 00:43:20,340
roll 2d 20s roll let him roll 40 10 oh no you got so you can only recover 10 HP

681
00:43:20,340 --> 00:43:26,040
after your 10th cold dog you just start vomiting but you're up with 10 with 11 HP

682
00:43:26,040 --> 00:43:33,320
now. Or we could do 25 if we want to be a little bit more generous. I think that's fine.

683
00:43:33,320 --> 00:43:39,480
Yeah, what do you guys think? Even after he throws up, I'm forcing the rest of them down

684
00:43:39,480 --> 00:43:48,880
his throat. To make I feel bad. Okay, cool. So yeah, you guys are in Atlanta City.

685
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:52,680
I started eating my puke. What do you guys want to do?

686
00:43:52,680 --> 00:43:54,680
You just have brain damage.

687
00:43:54,680 --> 00:43:56,680
*laughter*

688
00:43:56,680 --> 00:44:01,680
You just turned into like a disgusting demon.

689
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:05,680
Awww. I like this.

690
00:44:05,680 --> 00:44:06,680
*laughter*

691
00:44:06,680 --> 00:44:08,680
He's definitely not a girl anymore.

692
00:44:08,680 --> 00:44:10,680
That's true.

693
00:44:10,680 --> 00:44:14,680
I think something changed when you shot him in the head, Blowtooth.

694
00:44:14,680 --> 00:44:19,680
I want to go on the arcade.

695
00:44:19,680 --> 00:44:34,760
the

696
00:44:34,760 --> 00:44:49,840
the

697
00:44:49,840 --> 00:44:51,840
She will be here.

698
00:44:51,840 --> 00:44:53,840
(laughter)

699
00:44:53,840 --> 00:44:55,840
She has brain damage.

700
00:44:55,840 --> 00:44:57,840
(laughter)

701
00:44:57,840 --> 00:45:01,840
And then you put a face filter on the picture too to make her look beautiful.

702
00:45:01,840 --> 00:45:03,840
Yeah, Dougie Frees

703
00:45:03,840 --> 00:45:05,840
hearts the picture of Patrick.

704
00:45:05,840 --> 00:45:09,840
I am beautiful!

705
00:45:09,840 --> 00:45:13,840
Cool, yeah, so you guys head to the arcade.

706
00:45:13,840 --> 00:45:15,840
There's all manners of games here.

707
00:45:15,840 --> 00:45:17,840
There's slots you can play. There's other gambling

708
00:45:17,840 --> 00:45:37,220
and

709
00:45:37,220 --> 00:45:44,320
3 games you can play, there's pig, where there's a number that the house declares you're trying

710
00:45:44,320 --> 00:45:51,700
to reach, you can roll a bunch of d6s until you reach that number, if you get a 1 though,

711
00:45:51,700 --> 00:45:56,540
you lose, but you can roll up to until you say stop, right?

712
00:45:56,540 --> 00:46:00,260
We forgot to take money out of the cash register, right?

713
00:46:00,260 --> 00:46:01,260
Yeah, you guys did.

714
00:46:01,260 --> 00:46:02,260
Yeah, you guys did.

715
00:46:02,260 --> 00:46:03,260
You guys took it.

716
00:46:03,260 --> 00:46:04,260
We did?

717
00:46:04,260 --> 00:46:05,260
How much money was it?

718
00:46:05,260 --> 00:46:06,260
A million dollars, yeah.

719
00:46:06,260 --> 00:46:13,260
that

720
00:46:13,260 --> 00:46:28,260
the

721
00:46:28,260 --> 00:46:33,260
There are three rounds and three games per round.

722
00:46:33,260 --> 00:46:37,260
The way it works is you pick either a d12, d8, or d4.

723
00:46:37,260 --> 00:46:43,260
You roll, and the highest value against other players rolling their chosen dice wins.

724
00:46:43,260 --> 00:46:46,260
You get different point values depending on which dice you chose.

725
00:46:46,260 --> 00:46:54,260
And the dice actually explode as well, so when you get a max value on it, you can roll it again and add it up to it.

726
00:46:54,260 --> 00:47:01,260
it

727
00:47:01,260 --> 00:47:16,180
the

728
00:47:16,180 --> 00:47:30,240
the register. I got 741. I brought my own dice with me. He's rolling his personal 1000 sided

729
00:47:30,240 --> 00:47:36,300
die. So do you guys want to play slot? We're going to play pig and then we'll start with

730
00:47:36,300 --> 00:47:42,940
pig. So pig, we roll two d20s to pick the number. I will do that now. I'm going to also

731
00:47:42,940 --> 00:48:02,340
a

732
00:48:02,340 --> 00:48:16,220
the

733
00:48:16,220 --> 00:48:31,900
the

734
00:48:31,900 --> 00:48:33,900
How much did I win on a $62 bet?

735
00:48:33,900 --> 00:48:38,900
$62 bet? Did everybody meet him on $62?

736
00:48:38,900 --> 00:48:41,900
Wait, I thought you guys weren't playing pig. Everyone started to play pig.

737
00:48:41,900 --> 00:48:44,900
Yeah, I decided to play pig because it sounded fun after you said it.

738
00:48:44,900 --> 00:48:48,900
I know, but then everyone else started rolling. I thought it was only you and me playing.

739
00:48:48,900 --> 00:48:50,900
Okay, let's try again.

740
00:48:50,900 --> 00:48:53,900
Oh, is that why you lost? Because you thought that it was only you and me playing?

741
00:48:53,900 --> 00:48:57,900
No, I just, I mean, we lose a lot of money if everyone has played pig.

742
00:48:57,900 --> 00:49:00,900
But how much money do I win from that roll? Because I could just...

743
00:49:00,900 --> 00:49:20,820
to

744
00:49:20,820 --> 00:49:32,300
one

745
00:49:32,300 --> 00:49:47,380
the

746
00:49:47,380 --> 00:50:02,220
everyone

747
00:50:02,220 --> 00:50:09,220
you know

748
00:50:09,220 --> 00:50:14,740
the

749
00:50:14,740 --> 00:50:17,220
so that's not what is that one of the world ten

750
00:50:17,220 --> 00:50:18,220
i want to rule

751
00:50:18,220 --> 00:50:22,060
all my money into slots on the at once

752
00:50:22,060 --> 00:50:23,140
uh...

753
00:50:23,140 --> 00:50:28,060
okay uh... i don't know what's on the needed to release slots slots

754
00:50:28,060 --> 00:50:29,820
Okay, so you're gonna- okay, well hold on.

755
00:50:29,820 --> 00:50:32,740
So, yeah, the way SWATs works is it is-

756
00:50:32,740 --> 00:50:35,460
it's just two tokens to play,

757
00:50:35,460 --> 00:50:37,260
and then once you play, the way it works is-

758
00:50:37,260 --> 00:50:38,540
Two?

759
00:50:38,540 --> 00:50:39,500
What?

760
00:50:39,500 --> 00:50:41,900
Two tokens to play, not one?

761
00:50:41,900 --> 00:50:43,620
No, it's two.

762
00:50:43,620 --> 00:50:45,340
Is that okay?

763
00:50:45,340 --> 00:50:47,140
I guess you can keep talking.

764
00:50:47,140 --> 00:50:47,980
That's right, yeah.

765
00:50:47,980 --> 00:50:50,220
So, it's gonna be two tokens to play.

766
00:50:50,220 --> 00:50:52,940
Shit, where is the-

767
00:50:52,940 --> 00:50:53,780
There they are.

768
00:50:53,780 --> 00:50:57,260
If you get- if two match,

769
00:50:57,260 --> 00:50:59,980
then you get the value of those die together.

770
00:50:59,980 --> 00:51:02,980
If three match, you get the value of all those die together

771
00:51:02,980 --> 00:51:06,240
or times two.

772
00:51:06,240 --> 00:51:08,240
- Okay.

773
00:51:08,240 --> 00:51:11,420
- If you get all ones, three ones though,

774
00:51:11,420 --> 00:51:13,500
you're locked out of the machine for the month.

775
00:51:13,500 --> 00:51:14,340
- What?

776
00:51:14,340 --> 00:51:19,020
- If you get three 20s, you hit the jackpot.

777
00:51:19,020 --> 00:51:20,160
- Okay, I'm ready.

778
00:51:20,160 --> 00:51:23,020
- I've been following Blowtoss around

779
00:51:23,020 --> 00:51:24,660
'cause I think he's my mommy now.

780
00:51:26,780 --> 00:51:28,700
No, I'm not a girl.

781
00:51:28,700 --> 00:51:31,220
I can be your daddy.

782
00:51:31,220 --> 00:51:33,020
Mom.

783
00:51:33,020 --> 00:51:36,420
OK, roll three d20s.

784
00:51:36,420 --> 00:51:37,180
Nope.

785
00:51:37,180 --> 00:51:37,700
Nothing.

786
00:51:37,700 --> 00:51:39,820
OK, so I'm down to 60.

787
00:51:39,820 --> 00:51:41,420

00:51:41,420 --> 00:51:42,980
Oh, you got eight.

789
00:51:42,980 --> 00:51:45,660
You got a payout of eight right there.

790
00:51:45,660 --> 00:51:47,660
Barry got eight.

791
00:51:47,660 --> 00:51:48,420
OK.

792
00:51:48,420 --> 00:51:49,340
Barry got eight.

793
00:51:49,340 --> 00:51:50,300
I got nothing again.

794
00:51:50,300 --> 00:51:52,220
I'm down to 15.

795
00:51:52,220 --> 00:51:55,020

799
00:52:23,980 --> 00:52:26,980
Yeah, so uh yeah, I mean as you're doing this...

800
00:52:26,980 --> 00:52:28,980
Oh, I won 14.

801
00:52:28,980 --> 00:52:30,980
I'm back up to 16.

802
00:52:30,980 --> 00:52:34,480
I actually have no idea what this guy looks like and he thinks that we're a big fat Greek guy.

803
00:52:34,480 --> 00:52:36,480
Yeah, so...

804
00:52:36,480 --> 00:52:38,480
We do need to figure out how to find him.

805
00:52:38,480 --> 00:52:41,480
You should send a picture of the... where we are right now so that he comes to mind.

806
00:52:41,480 --> 00:52:47,480
Okay, I sent a picture of the... just a small section of the repeating pattern of the carpet.

807
00:52:47,480 --> 00:52:49,480
And I said, "We are here."

808
00:52:49,480 --> 00:52:59,320
What's the biggest thing in this room right now?

809
00:52:59,320 --> 00:53:00,320
The biggest thing in this room?

810
00:53:00,320 --> 00:53:01,320
It's a good meeting place.

811
00:53:01,320 --> 00:53:11,880
Yeah, there's a big statue of Mary-Kate Cabrera doing a strongman pose.

812
00:53:11,880 --> 00:53:17,320
Okay, you should take a picture of that and say "meet us here."

813
00:53:17,320 --> 00:53:32,400
the

814
00:53:32,400 --> 00:53:44,840
the

815
00:53:44,840 --> 00:53:45,340
Yeah, yeah.

816
00:53:45,340 --> 00:53:45,840
Strongman pose?

817
00:53:45,840 --> 00:53:47,840
Like, like what, like you do it.

818
00:53:47,840 --> 00:53:48,340
What's the...

819
00:53:48,340 --> 00:53:50,340
Yeah, like that.

820
00:53:50,340 --> 00:53:50,840
Like that.

821
00:53:50,840 --> 00:53:53,840
Okay, I'm sitting on top of the left hand.

822
00:53:53,840 --> 00:53:54,840
Mm-hmm.

823
00:53:54,840 --> 00:53:56,840
Why did you need patches to do that?

824
00:53:56,840 --> 00:53:58,840
'Cause I wanted to see.

825
00:53:58,840 --> 00:53:59,840
*laughs*

826
00:53:59,840 --> 00:54:01,840
He was thinking he was gonna do a different strongman pose.

827
00:54:01,840 --> 00:54:05,840
I thought that, I thought that patches would maybe roll his sleeves up and show me his biceps, but...

828
00:54:05,840 --> 00:54:07,840
I'm fine with what I saw.

829
00:54:07,840 --> 00:54:09,840
So, uh, yeah, you go over there and just...

830
00:54:09,840 --> 00:54:11,840
I think I know what pose he wanted patches to do.

831
00:54:11,840 --> 00:54:16,160
to do. I can't even say it because it's so nasty.

832
00:54:16,160 --> 00:54:19,000
Why would I do that? Why would that be my first instinct?

833
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:21,960
What? What was the nasty pose? I don't need to

834
00:54:21,960 --> 00:54:22,960
know. So yeah, you go to the statue.

835
00:54:22,960 --> 00:54:28,840
I'm up to 104 tokens, guys. And you go to the statue, and yeah, you see

836
00:54:28,840 --> 00:54:37,520
this sort of Rutger Hauer looking guy with slicked back, very bleached, bleached blonde

837
00:54:37,520 --> 00:54:47,400
hair, sort of sidle up to the statue, sort of looking around, and he turns his attention

838
00:54:47,400 --> 00:55:02,440
the

839
00:55:02,440 --> 00:55:04,420
the fifth

840
00:55:04,420 --> 00:55:08,420
*laughter*

841
00:55:08,420 --> 00:55:10,420
Okay...

842
00:55:10,420 --> 00:55:12,420
Ice cream!

843
00:55:12,420 --> 00:55:16,420
Where's Nico?

844
00:55:16,420 --> 00:55:19,420
Oh, I-I think he lied over there

845
00:55:19,420 --> 00:55:21,420
to the freeze guy, and I say, uh...

846
00:55:21,420 --> 00:55:23,420
"Your friend is in the bathroom."

847
00:55:23,420 --> 00:55:28,420
He's taking- he said he had to take a huge shit.

848
00:55:28,420 --> 00:55:30,420
Oh, it's so stinky over there.

849
00:55:30,420 --> 00:55:31,420
Ice cream.

850
00:55:31,420 --> 00:55:43,860
the

851
00:55:43,860 --> 00:55:50,060
Why do I got a really cool way that we basically tricked the whole game and and get free money? Yeah

852
00:55:50,060 --> 00:55:54,600
It's awesome. And we heard that you like shit. Yeah, you can see it if you want

853
00:55:54,600 --> 00:55:58,020
We're not ready to let you in on it, but you can watch us do it

854
00:55:58,020 --> 00:56:00,660
Where's an eco?

855
00:56:00,660 --> 00:56:03,580
He said to hear he's in the bathroom

856
00:56:03,580 --> 00:56:08,980
He wanted us to talk to you to entertain you and he thought that we might be able to become friends even

857
00:56:08,980 --> 00:56:11,500
ice-cream bar

Deception me. Yeah, but you got one of you guys can give me

859
00:56:16,220 --> 00:56:24,260
You guys can give him advantage. How do you give me advantage? I'm giving him advantage by working basically by helping him which is which they are

860
00:56:24,260 --> 00:56:26,900
critical failures

861
00:56:26,900 --> 00:56:29,900
If okay that helps

862
00:56:37,140 --> 00:56:44,540
Deceive him I thought he was a screwed man. His name is mr. Freeze. Okay, we can roll again Caleb. Okay

863

So you should talk to them and I'm gonna go over there sit his tracks and he turns around

Blalalalalala

878
00:57:46,540 --> 00:57:48,540
Casino being breakfast

883
00:57:56,540 --> 00:57:58,540
Want to buy things

884
00:57:58,540 --> 00:58:00,540
From you

885
00:58:00,540 --> 00:58:12,980

00:58:40,740 --> 00:58:46,140
You hear me in the background, "Bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla

889
00:58:46,140 --> 00:58:51,140
I'm trying to communicate with him because I completely understand what he's saying.

890
00:58:51,140 --> 00:58:53,140
Yeah, so yeah, Ray and-

891

And Botas are going, yeah, yeah.

893
00:58:58,140 --> 00:59:04,140
Yeah, Ray and Pat are sort of doing their own kind of twisted buddy comedy.

894
00:59:04,140 --> 00:59:06,700
What happened to all the people in both cops rooms?

895
00:59:06,700 --> 00:59:08,500
Gabby Gifford.

896
00:59:08,500 --> 00:59:13,280
Oh, yeah.

And so, yeah, you three are head to the back of the arcade.

898
00:59:17,180 --> 00:59:19,740
There's a little elevator.

899
00:59:19,740 --> 00:59:21,940
Security guard nods to Mr.

900
00:59:21,940 --> 00:59:24,140
Freeze and moves aside.

901
00:59:24,140 --> 00:59:25,900
He lets you guys in.

902
00:59:25,900 --> 00:59:28,380
The elevator takes you up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up.

903
00:59:28,380 --> 00:59:33,300
And you guys are let out into a very lush, red, velvety room.

904
00:59:33,300 --> 00:59:52,020

905
00:59:52,020 --> 01:00:02,900

the

911
01:00:56,940 --> 01:00:58,940

912
01:00:58,940 --> 01:01:00,940
Whatever.

913
01:01:00,940 --> 01:01:02,940
Cool.

914
01:01:02,940 --> 01:01:06,940
She says, my friend here tells me you guys want golden bullets and love slime.

915
01:01:06,940 --> 01:01:08,940
Yes.

916
01:01:08,940 --> 01:01:10,940
Yes.

917
01:01:10,940 --> 01:01:12,940
And a brain damage remover.

918
01:01:12,940 --> 01:01:14,940
And an ice cream bar.

919
01:01:14,940 --> 01:01:18,940
Do you want an ice cream bar?

920
01:01:18,940 --> 01:01:20,940
Yeah.

921
01:01:20,940 --> 01:01:22,940
But if we get the brain damage remover we don't need the ice cream bar.

922
01:01:22,940 --> 01:01:24,940
That's true.

923
01:01:24,940 --> 01:01:26,940
Ice cream bar!

924
01:01:26,940 --> 01:01:30,940
Wow that guy is really loud down there.

925
01:01:30,940 --> 01:01:36,940
I don't know what I could do about a brain damage remover but um...

926
01:01:36,940 --> 01:01:40,940
If we're talking about golden bullets and love slime...

927
01:01:40,940 --> 01:01:44,940
I might got some people for ya.

928
01:01:44,940 --> 01:01:46,940
Ice cream bar!

929
01:01:46,940 --> 01:01:48,940
Yeah, why don't we go to the ice cream bar?

930
01:01:48,940 --> 01:01:50,940
Yeah!

931
01:01:50,940 --> 01:01:53,940
Don't make us get really nasty.

932
01:01:53,940 --> 01:02:06,380
the

933
01:02:06,380 --> 01:02:08,520
the

934
01:02:08,520 --> 01:02:10,720
the

935
01:02:10,720 --> 01:02:12,920
the

936
01:02:12,920 --> 01:02:15,160
the

937
01:02:15,160 --> 01:02:17,360
the

938
01:02:17,360 --> 01:02:19,600
the

939
01:02:19,600 --> 01:02:21,800
the

940
01:02:21,800 --> 01:02:23,800
- What's the deal? - Green bar!

941
01:02:23,800 --> 01:02:27,800
- So, if you want, you have to go to-- - Blah blah blah, all you do is talk, just tell us.

942
01:02:27,800 --> 01:02:29,800
[laughter]

943
01:02:29,800 --> 01:02:34,800
So the guy who has the bullets would be Goldbeard.

944
01:02:34,800 --> 01:02:36,800
- Ooh! - Now...

945
01:02:36,800 --> 01:02:41,800
- Oh! - Goldbeard has not been seen in a while.

946
01:02:41,800 --> 01:02:44,800
But...

947
01:02:44,800 --> 01:02:48,800
I can make him appear very easily.

948
01:02:49,800 --> 01:02:51,800
But...

949
01:02:51,800 --> 01:02:53,800
*laughter*

950
01:02:53,800 --> 01:02:55,800
*laughter*

951
01:02:55,800 --> 01:02:58,800
Are you catching on? There's gotta be something in it for me.

952
01:02:58,800 --> 01:03:00,800
Oh!

953
01:03:00,800 --> 01:03:02,800
Oh, uh, well I am like...

954
01:03:02,800 --> 01:03:04,800
How does four dollars sound?

955
01:03:04,800 --> 01:03:06,800
102 tokens, yeah.

956
01:03:06,800 --> 01:03:08,800
We all have four dollars.

957
01:03:08,800 --> 01:03:10,800
Ice cream?

958
01:03:10,800 --> 01:03:12,800
Okay, um...

959
01:03:12,800 --> 01:03:14,800
Bye!

960
01:03:14,800 --> 01:03:16,800
How much money do you want?

961
01:03:16,800 --> 01:03:18,800
Depends.

962
01:03:18,800 --> 01:03:23,160
What are you going to have whenever you're done with whatever it is you're doing with

963
01:03:23,160 --> 01:03:25,800
those things?

964
01:03:25,800 --> 01:03:27,680
We are doing it for fun.

965
01:03:27,680 --> 01:03:33,120
We like to go to the desert and shoot stuff and blow stuff up.

966
01:03:33,120 --> 01:03:38,120
Roll deception with advantage.

967
01:03:38,120 --> 01:03:40,120
My deception never works.

968
01:03:40,120 --> 01:03:46,640
This is going to suck.

969
01:03:46,640 --> 01:03:47,640
Not bad.

970
01:03:47,640 --> 01:03:49,640
Roll again.

971
01:03:49,640 --> 01:03:51,640
Yep, you have advantage.

972
01:03:51,640 --> 01:03:53,640
Advantage just means that you get to do it twice?

973
01:03:53,640 --> 01:03:55,640
Yeah, twice and you take the higher number.

974
01:03:55,640 --> 01:03:57,640
Yeah.

975
01:03:57,640 --> 01:03:59,640
Okay.

976
01:03:59,640 --> 01:04:01,640
I guess I should just have my character sheet open, huh?

977
01:04:01,640 --> 01:04:03,640
I'm such an idiot.

978
01:04:03,640 --> 01:04:05,640
What? You've been closing it every time?

979
01:04:05,640 --> 01:04:07,640
I'm an idiot.

980
01:04:07,640 --> 01:04:09,640
What?

981
01:04:09,640 --> 01:04:11,640
Alright, so yeah.

982
01:04:11,640 --> 01:04:13,640
Alright, fine, whatever.

983
01:04:13,640 --> 01:04:15,640
What about a job then?

984
01:04:15,640 --> 01:04:19,640
I'm not gonna give you money, what if I got you guys to do a little job for me?

985
01:04:19,640 --> 01:04:21,640
You can have twelve dollars!

986
01:04:21,640 --> 01:04:23,640
*laughter*

987
01:04:23,640 --> 01:04:27,640
I have somebody I need- I have somebody I need to be shaken down.

988
01:04:27,640 --> 01:04:31,640
If I tell you guys who it is, you do it for me, you get back here.

989
01:04:31,640 --> 01:04:35,640
I'll get you gold beer, I'll get you the bullets, I'll see what I can do about love slime.

990
01:04:35,640 --> 01:04:37,640
Fine.

991
01:04:37,640 --> 01:04:40,640
Okay. As long as it's that pregnant lady.

992
01:04:40,640 --> 01:04:42,640
What pregnant lady?

993
01:04:42,640 --> 01:04:44,640
The one we wanna shake.

994
01:04:44,640 --> 01:04:46,640
*laughter*

995
01:04:46,640 --> 01:04:49,640
Alright, what does the guy look like? Where do we get him?

996
01:04:49,640 --> 01:04:51,640
Alright.

997
01:04:51,640 --> 01:04:55,640
Um, hold on, sorry, I'm pulling my sheet.

998
01:04:55,640 --> 01:04:58,640
You're gonna take a sheet?

999
01:04:58,640 --> 01:05:00,640
Nasty ass.

1000
01:05:00,640 --> 01:05:01,640
Oh hell no.

1001
01:05:01,640 --> 01:05:02,640
Oh hell no.

1002
01:05:02,640 --> 01:05:05,640
That's just... eww.

1003
01:05:05,640 --> 01:05:06,640
No, it's not what I...

1004
01:05:06,640 --> 01:05:07,640
You disgust me.

1005
01:05:07,640 --> 01:05:08,640
Okay.

1006
01:05:08,640 --> 01:05:11,640
His name is Shiny Andrew.

1007
01:05:11,640 --> 01:05:13,640
*laughter*

1008
01:05:13,640 --> 01:05:15,640
He's a, uh...

1009
01:05:15,640 --> 01:05:20,520
Investor in my operation, and he owes me some money.

1010
01:05:20,520 --> 01:05:27,080
You can go- you can find him up in the main district in Gun City.

1011
01:05:27,080 --> 01:05:30,080
Oh, wait! Shiny Andrew?

1012
01:05:30,080 --> 01:05:32,280
Oh yeah?

1013
01:05:32,280 --> 01:05:40,000
Yeah, I think I heard that he killed the guy who owns the bodega, or runs it, and-

1014
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:42,000
*laughter*

1015
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:44,000
*laughter*

1016
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:46,000
Absolutely a deception, that is an ocelot move.

1017
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:48,000
I love that. Yeah.

1018
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:50,000
Roll deception with advantage on that too.

1019
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:52,000
*laughter* I fuck with that.

1020
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:54,000
It's like the bodega, dude.

1021
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:56,000
*laughter*

1022
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:58,000
It's all good.

1023
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:00,000
We're having fun. I love that.

1024
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:02,000
Roll again, roll again, get advantage.

1025
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:04,000
Okay.

1026
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:06,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1027
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:08,000
Whoa.

1028
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:10,000
contact freeze

1029
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:10,800
um...

1030
01:06:10,800 --> 01:06:11,800
niko's dead

1031
01:06:11,800 --> 01:06:13,800
i thought you guys said he was in the bathroom

1032
01:06:13,800 --> 01:06:15,800
no that crazy homeless guy said he was in the bathroom

1033
01:06:15,800 --> 01:06:17,800
and also yes he died in the bathroom

1034
01:06:17,800 --> 01:06:19,800
died in the bathroom

1035
01:06:19,800 --> 01:06:23,800
oh fuck

1036
01:06:23,800 --> 01:06:25,800
so

1037
01:06:25,800 --> 01:06:27,800
we're just gonna go do the job

1038
01:06:27,800 --> 01:06:29,800
you don't worry or do any roles

1039
01:06:29,800 --> 01:06:31,800
about this

1040
01:06:31,800 --> 01:06:33,800
it's all dependent on

1041
01:06:33,800 --> 01:06:35,800
if you guys stop saying crazy shit

1042
01:06:37,800 --> 01:06:50,240
the

1043
01:06:50,240 --> 01:06:53,520
You do have to figure that out.

1044
01:06:53,520 --> 01:06:56,840
Go find shiny Andrew for me.

1045
01:06:56,840 --> 01:07:00,240
How much money does shiny Andrew owe you?

1046
01:07:00,240 --> 01:07:01,240
A lot.

1047
01:07:01,240 --> 01:07:05,600
Yeah, we'll go find him, but can you give us like...

1048
01:07:05,600 --> 01:07:06,600
How much?

1049
01:07:06,600 --> 01:07:07,600
Like an amount of money?

1050
01:07:07,600 --> 01:07:10,880
I think we need, like, where are we looking for him and what, is there anything we need

1051
01:07:10,880 --> 01:07:11,880
to watch out for?

1052
01:07:11,880 --> 01:07:16,600
You want us to kill him because you really fucking shot your friend in the esophagus

1053
01:07:16,600 --> 01:07:17,600
or something.

1054
01:07:17,600 --> 01:07:21,920
You don't give us any information, you're setting us up to fail and that's bad for you.

1055
01:07:21,920 --> 01:07:24,760
All right, all right, all right.

1056
01:07:24,760 --> 01:07:25,760
Shiny Andrew.

1057
01:07:25,760 --> 01:07:30,480
We want your coolest weapon too.

1058
01:07:30,480 --> 01:07:35,760
Shiny Andrew is a quantum crypto investor.

1059
01:07:35,760 --> 01:07:40,640
So he's frequently around the Wall Street district.

1060
01:07:40,640 --> 01:07:41,940
You probably have to find him there.

1061
01:07:41,940 --> 01:07:53,380
is

1062
01:07:53,380 --> 01:07:56,820
weaknesses or sexual proclivities?

1063
01:07:56,820 --> 01:08:05,340
I don't know about his sexual proclivities, but I do know that he does not like the dark.

1064
01:08:05,340 --> 01:08:07,340
He's often only out during the day.

1065
01:08:07,340 --> 01:08:13,220
How does he feel about bombs?

1066
01:08:13,220 --> 01:08:17,700
He might be pro or anti-bomb, depending on sort of his distance from them when they're

1067
01:08:17,700 --> 01:08:18,700
exploding.

1068
01:08:18,700 --> 01:08:31,140
the

1069
01:08:31,140 --> 01:08:37,540
is that? Oh, so we shouldn't kill him? Well, I want you to rough him up. Yeah, but how much

1070
01:08:37,540 --> 01:08:42,740
money do you owe him? Yeah, don't kill him. He does give me money when he's not. Okay,

1071
01:08:42,740 --> 01:08:45,700
but how much money is he going to give you? How much money is he going to give you?

1072
01:08:45,700 --> 01:08:50,180
Why do you need to know that? Just so we know how much money is in his pocket so that...

1073
01:08:50,180 --> 01:08:55,540
It's not going to be in his pocket. Well, it's how much money does he owe you? I feel like that

1074
01:08:55,540 --> 01:09:04,740
determines how persuasion persuasion who has good persuasion I think I do

1075
01:09:04,740 --> 01:09:14,820

1079
01:09:28,540 --> 01:09:30,860

1080
01:09:30,860 --> 01:09:34,900
Wait, yeah saying this out loud

1083
01:09:47,260 --> 01:09:51,500

01:10:09,600 --> 01:10:13,020

1089
01:10:13,020 --> 01:10:18,080
Long beard I'm covered in blood and diarrhea

1090
01:10:18,080 --> 01:10:37,460
the

1091
01:10:37,460 --> 01:10:41,460
I find this guy named Shiny Andrew and the person also said that

1092
01:10:41,460 --> 01:10:45,460
um, that Sullivan the frog needs to give a bunch of

1093
01:10:45,460 --> 01:10:49,460
money and if he doesn't win over 1 million tokens gambling tonight

1094
01:10:49,460 --> 01:10:53,460
he will be killed. No, really? Yeah, they said that.

1095
01:10:53,460 --> 01:10:57,460
So you better hop to it, buddy.

1096
01:10:57,460 --> 01:11:01,460
(laughter)

1097
01:11:01,460 --> 01:11:05,460
But okay. And yeah, Sullivan just goes by the slot machine and starts

1098
01:11:05,460 --> 01:11:12,460
I saw Blotas laughing and I've just been laughing for...

1099
01:11:12,460 --> 01:11:18,460
I haven't stopped laughing.

1100
01:11:18,460 --> 01:11:22,460
Um, yeah, and uh, yeah, you...

1101
01:11:22,460 --> 01:11:26,460
I'm starting to treat him like a child.

1102
01:11:26,460 --> 01:11:30,460
Because I really miss Cool Sullivan, who's away at college.

1103
01:11:30,460 --> 01:11:45,540

1104
01:11:45,540 --> 01:11:49,860
There's five day time limit on the mission. No, I thought I'm limit

1105
01:11:49,860 --> 01:11:53,540
We can be over like four days 20 hours

1106
01:11:53,540 --> 01:11:59,840
Honestly really fun and I'd like to play it again. Yeah, let's play more big. Okay. All right

all everything

1109
01:12:04,260 --> 01:12:12,140
Money that he owes then we could put it all on pig. Oh, that's actually a way better idea. Let's go do that

1110
01:12:13,020 --> 01:12:16,660
You're gonna go beat up this guy and we can like quadruple the money

1111
01:12:16,660 --> 01:12:25,160
Wait is shiny Andrews number in Nico's phone

1113
01:12:27,900 --> 01:12:29,900
Yeah, it's actually not a bad idea

1114
01:12:29,900 --> 01:12:32,180
You can have it meet us here

1115
01:12:32,180 --> 01:12:35,720
Mm-hmm. We can play pig until he gets here

Yeah

1118
01:12:44,460 --> 01:12:53,420
Of that place that we have to do the heist on we could probably like contract like a construction company just move the heist building in here

1119
01:12:53,420 --> 01:13:01,700
Okay, you guys want to play one more round of pig or do you want to stay
