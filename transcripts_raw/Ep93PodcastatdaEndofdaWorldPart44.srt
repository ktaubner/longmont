1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
You're listening to Israel's number one podcast.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,580
(upbeat music)

3
00:00:06,580 --> 00:00:11,080
- Crap monster.

4
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:11,900
(laughing)

5
00:00:11,900 --> 00:00:12,740
(explosion)

6
00:00:12,740 --> 00:00:13,580
- All right.

7
00:00:13,580 --> 00:00:14,720
- It's actually been a couple minutes

8
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:16,360
since we stopped recording the last one,

9
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:17,600
so I did have to remember,

10
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:18,560
we're talking about VeggieTales.

11
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:20,320
- Yeah, we're talking about VeggieTales.

12
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:21,160
- Kick it off.

13
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:22,000
- We gotta talk about--

14
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:22,820
- If you listened to the last premium,

15
00:00:22,820 --> 00:00:24,280
we ended on about VeggieTales.

16
00:00:24,280 --> 00:00:26,720
And if you didn't listen to it, you should subscribe.

17
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:27,880
- Yeah, it really is like,

18
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:30,860
these four episodes we record today will...

19
00:00:30,860 --> 00:00:32,580
- It's kind of a saga.

20
00:00:32,580 --> 00:00:34,260
- You have to listen to them all in a row

21
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:35,100
or else you lose it.

22
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:37,980
- It's kind of like when you listen to the album version

23
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:40,500
of an Eminem song and then there's a skit before it

24
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:42,540
that cross-fades into the song.

25
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:45,780
And then you get the last couple seconds of the skit.

26
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:46,980
- Yeah, like Paul.

27
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:48,780
- Yeah, and then you're like, "Ngh!"

28
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:50,180
- And then the song starts.

29
00:00:50,180 --> 00:00:52,820
- Yeah, and then you're like, "Oh, I wonder what that's from."

30
00:00:52,820 --> 00:00:54,900
And then it makes sense when you listen to the skit.

31
00:00:54,900 --> 00:00:55,740
- Basically, you're--

32
00:00:55,740 --> 00:00:56,560
- That's what you gotta do

33
00:00:56,560 --> 00:01:02,300
If you're not a Patreon subscriber, it's like watching the second and fourth Harry

34
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:04,920
Potters and not the first and third.

35
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:06,240
It's like watching Harry Potter.

36
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:07,880
You're going to be like, "What the hell?

37
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:09,400
Hermione got hot too fast."

38
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:11,960
It's like watching Harry Potter but with your one eye closed.

39
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:12,960
Yeah.

40
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:13,960
Impossible to understand.

41
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:15,920
So we were talking about VeggieTales.

42
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:23,700
There was a character in Jonah, a VeggieTales movie.

43
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:25,800
Did you guys watch just the movies or did you watch the show?

44
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:30,220
I've seen basically every thing. I've seen most of the episodes.

45
00:01:30,220 --> 00:01:33,220
I think I saw all of it but didn't see the movies.

46
00:01:33,220 --> 00:01:34,220

You didn't see the movie though?

55
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:44,720

appeared Khalil has an Indian accent he is a blue caterpillar just I love

86
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:53,720
something I love about that Jonah movie is like he finds Sodom and Gomorrah and

00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:06,960
for like gay sex because that's the whole thing yeah the Bible is like

90
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:09,880
Sodom and Gomorrah, they love drinking slushies.

91
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:10,720
(laughing)

92
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:11,560
- Oh my God.

93
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:14,140
- They love slushies.

94
00:04:14,140 --> 00:04:17,160
They love purple slushies and they suck on 'em.

95
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:20,220
And it's just a bunch of peas running around

96
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:21,640
sucking on slushies.

97
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:22,480
- God damn, dude.

98
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:23,820
- And so they get killed for that?

99
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:26,080

100
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:29,360
I don't think they, oh no, yeah, the place explodes.

101
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:31,080
Yeah, God explodes it.

102
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:35,100
God fucking goes Nagasaki on the place

103
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:36,360
where they have too many slushies

104
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:38,220
and they like candy too much.

105
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:39,640
- Oh my God. - It rocks, dude.

106
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:41,320
- There's a piece of trivia here, though,

107
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:43,640
for Khalil from VeggieTales.

108
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:48,640
- Also, funny that he, that's like the only name

109
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:51,400
in that entire show that is not like--

110
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:53,600
- Yeah, it's not Larry. - Whatever the vegetable.

111
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:54,440
- Yeah. - Yeah.

112
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:56,160
- It's like there's a worm-- - Khalil Da Worm.

113
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:58,320
- Yeah, Khalil, the only person with a vaguely--

114
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:00,000
- It's Jamal Da Worm's brother.

115
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,840
- A vaguely Middle Eastern name, they make a worm.

116
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:04,320
(all laughing)

117
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:09,320
Well so here's a piece of trivia. Oh my God. With a giant nose by the way.

118
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:13,320
Look at this fucking. Yeah. These JPEGs are awful. But.

119
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:18,320
He's a worm with a big giant. He looks like Big Dave. Let him read the tr...

120
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:22,320
Let him read the tr... Let him read the trivia. It says here due to his

121
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:28,320
ethnicity an online review for Jonah a VeggieTales movie went as far as

122
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:32,320
pointing out the fact that Khalil's involvement in the film was written

123
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:41,600
9/11. Just imagine his point. Because Khalil is the one who's like God, because he's, Jonah's like I

124
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:47,120
can't like I don't care about going to to Sodom and Gomorrah and Khalil's like no

125
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:56,400
God has to destroy it. And then he blows it up. Okay so there's there's a picture here of K.Lil. Yeah who's

126
00:05:56,400 --> 00:06:02,520
rap Khalil. Yeah but then there is one of salesman Khalil which is somebody just

127
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:08,560
went into Microsoft Paint and made him orange. Damn. Also worms don't have legs.

128
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:14,240
Yeah. Caterpillar. But why is he a worm? He's a caterpillar. Oh. Khalil the worm.

129
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:19,080
Khalil the caterpillar and Jamal the worm. Yeah. Brothers and best friends. And

130
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:25,400
enemies. And best enemies. Yeah best enemies. Yeah. Rivals, competitors, and best

like two weeks later seeing them just blow weed smoke in the dog's face.

150
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:45,760
It's like brain damage. To be like oh yeah no they're just

151
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:49,360
making them sick. Yeah. Yeah, weed is not good for dogs. No, it's not.

It makes dogs like depressed. Yeah, I feel like dogs are every dog. I know is depressed. That's true. My dog is not depressed

00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:59,520
She's uh anxious. She's uh, yeah

00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:21,960
Golden Retrievers, they just built like the biggest stupidest dog they could.

00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:25,360
It is funny, these dogs are just retarded wolves.

Except for Pitbulls.

166
00:08:30,860 --> 00:08:33,160
Pitbulls are smart and strong. That's why they're dangerous.

167
00:08:33,160 --> 00:08:34,860
Dude, I used to have a Pitbull.

168
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:36,860
I love Pitbulls. That's like my favorite kind of dog.

169
00:08:36,860 --> 00:08:38,860
We had to give her away, but like she like...

170
00:08:38,860 --> 00:08:39,860
The girl ones are horny.

171
00:08:39,860 --> 00:08:40,860
Dude, yeah.

172
00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:41,360
Yeah, man.

173
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:42,360
She used to like...

174
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:44,360
She was like a fucking meatball.

175
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:45,360
Yeah, I used to wake up and...

176
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:49,800
She was like a, like, she was so huge and like her leg, like...

177
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:50,800
She was a meatball?

178
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:51,800
Yeah.

179
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:52,800
I thought she was a doll.

180
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:53,800
She was, no, she was like...

181
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:54,800
She's bulbous.

182
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:55,800
She's bulbous.

183
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:58,800
Dude, she was buff as shit and it was just so hard because she was, every time she saw

184
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:01,400
me was like, she was too excited to see me.

185
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:02,400
Oh yeah.

186
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:05,400
You live with a female pit bull, you wake up every day, it's sitting on your face trying

187
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:06,400
to get you to eat its pussy.

188
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:09,400
That's how horny the dog is.

189
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:10,400
Yeah.

190
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:12,360
Some people wake up to their dog licking them.

191
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:13,360
Yeah.

192
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:20,360
you wake up to it and you're like a dog. It's a different pair of legs. Oh my god. Sorry. I had a dream. I was eating ravioli and I woke up.

193
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:24,360
I woke up and I was eating my dog's pussy.

194
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:27,360
Jesus Christ.

195
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:29,360
Oh my god.

196
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:32,360
That's disgusting. That is disgusting.

197
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:34,360
It's cheesy.

198
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:36,360
It's delicious.

199
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:38,360
Yeah.

200
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:43,480
dream I was in the finest Italian restaurant. I woke up and it still tastes exactly like ravioli.

201
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:50,200
Fido, what are you doing? A girl dog. Fido. Come on. Fido's a, Fido's a gin. I can't,

202
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:57,000

203
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Mrs. Fido. This is my dog, Mrs. She's All That. Fidoette. A-L-L-Z-That. Fido. Fidecio. Fidecio.

204
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:09,220
- Medea. - Fidecio.

205
00:10:09,220 --> 00:10:11,980
(laughing)

206
00:10:11,980 --> 00:10:13,380
- Here's my pit bull named Medea.

207
00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:14,600
I wake up every morning to her

208
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:16,560
sticking her giant pussy on my face.

209
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:17,400
- Jesus.

210
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:19,640
(laughing)

211
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:22,000
- Yeah.

212
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,320
- Yeah, that's how they kill you, dude.

213
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:24,720
That's how they're dangerous.

214
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:26,520
And their bred,

215
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:29,520
their male ones are fighters,

216
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:31,320
but the girl ones are fuckers, dude.

217
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:32,160
(laughing)

218
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:33,000
They'll get you.

219
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,200
- They will get you, dude.

220
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:36,420
That is always funny when like a female dog

221
00:10:36,420 --> 00:10:37,460
will like hump you.

222
00:10:37,460 --> 00:10:42,760
Mm-hmm. You're so you fucking idiot the girl ones have lesbian competitions and underground rings they do

223
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:51,020
Yeah, but you're like yeah, but like that's a boy lesbians

224
00:10:51,020 --> 00:11:01,420
Dogs fuck each other. That's what Michael Vick thought he was doing. Yeah. Yeah, you know you just have my dog is the stinkiest

225
00:11:01,420 --> 00:11:03,580
squanch

226
00:11:03,580 --> 00:11:05,580
Drop it on your dog and kill it

227
00:11:06,340 --> 00:11:08,340
What a way to start an episode.

228
00:11:08,340 --> 00:11:11,020
Yeah, my dog and her poison pussy will

229
00:11:11,020 --> 00:11:13,800
Will win. She's a prize fighter

230
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:24,820
I don't want to talk about this anymore. It's funny

231
00:11:24,820 --> 00:11:32,220
Dude it's so gross. What dog pussy? Yeah, why? What's the problem with that? Pussy's pussy man

232
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:39,640
Like Snoop Dogg says, "Pussy is pussy, and baby, you're pussy for life."

233
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:40,640
He says that?

234
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:43,720
He says that in A-Kon, "I Wanna Fuck You."

235
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:45,520
That's the end of his verses.

236
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:50,160
He says, "Cause pussy is pussy, and baby, you're pussy for life."

237
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:54,240
It's so funny finding out that song was called "I Wanna Fuck You."

238
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:58,160
That is a song where it comes on the radio and you're like, "That sounds normal."

239
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:02,840
But then if you try to listen to it on Spotify or whatever, just the "I Wanna Fuck You" version

240
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:07,720
comes up and it sounds insane. It sounds like a Rucka Rucka Ali version.

241
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:09,160
Yeah, it sounds like a parody.

242
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:10,160
Yeah.

243
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:13,360
I wanna fuck you? What a terrible hook.

244
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:14,840
I wanna fuck you.

245
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:17,040
That's like when they changed Let's Get It Started.

246
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:18,040
I wanna love you.

247
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:20,960
That's like when they changed Let's Get Retarded to Let's Get It Started.

248
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:22,240
Yeah, it's like you go back.

249
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:26,480
Yeah, I remember hearing that the old version for the first time and just being like, what

250
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:27,480
the fuck?

251
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:29,680
Yeah, it was an SSX Tricky.

252
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:30,680
I remember it was on my parents.

253
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:31,680
Like the original.

254
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:35,680
the original version was on my parents iPod and I was like what are they

255
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:42,440
listening to? What is this? Dude it's so the fucking the line he says before "get stupid"

256
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:50,480
yeah that's so fucking crazy yeah get stupid wear a helmet live at home with your parents till

257
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:58,880
you're 50 die young damn yeah dude oh man it's so it's so funny the only reason

258
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:04,560
that they changed the lyrics was because the NBA wanted to use it in their

259
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:09,760
commercials yeah yeah they would if the NBA didn't want to use that song that's

260
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:14,280
the only version of the song. There would be no Shakira. Yeah. Or not Shakira. There'd be no Fergie.

261
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:18,920
Shakira O'Neal.

262
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:22,840
Basketball don't lie.

263
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:24,980
- Ball don't lie, Shakiro and you know.

264
00:13:24,980 --> 00:13:26,800
- Oh, maybe when you hoop like that,

265
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:29,320
you make Will Chamberlain go mad.

266
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:30,160
- Whoa!

267
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:35,740
- And then it still has Wyclef on it,

268
00:13:35,740 --> 00:13:38,480
but his name is Wyclef Basketball.

269
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:40,160
(laughing)

270
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:43,400
- Wyclef Basketball shorts instead of Wyclef jeans.

271
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:45,560
- Oh, that's good.

272
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:46,400
- Wow.

273
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:47,240
- Wow.

274
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:49,360
- You know, didn't Wyclef like steal all the money

275
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:50,200
from Haiti?

276
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:51,040
- Yeah.

277
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:52,280
- That's a fucking boss move, dude.

278
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:54,660
I'm gonna dunk a basketball into his asshole.

279
00:13:54,660 --> 00:13:56,480
Who was the third guy in the Fugees?

280
00:13:56,480 --> 00:14:03,600
It was Lauryn Hill, Wyclef, and then the other guy, and he had the song from Bullworth.

281
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:08,080
It's a song from Bullworth, and Old Dirty Bastard has a feature.

282
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:10,160
We've talked about Bullworth and just how fucking stupid that is.

283
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:11,720
Yeah, we did talk about Bullworth already.

284
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:13,680
Do you remember when Nas had The Firm?

285
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:14,680
No.

286
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:15,680
Which was like his version of the Fugees.

287
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:17,960
The Firm was a skateboard company.

288
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:18,960
That's all I know.

289
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:23,720
The firm was like, it was him and a girl and a guy, and another guy, and they were just

290
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:26,680
pretending to be the Fugees for a while.

291
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:27,680
Fugees rocks, man.

292
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:28,680
Yeah, Fugees are good.

293
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:30,480
Yeah, that one Fugees album is really good.

294
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:33,280
But yeah, I don't know who the other guy is that isn't Wyclef.

295
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:34,280
Yeah.

296
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:35,280
Yeah, it's probably Black Eyed Peas.

297
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:37,240
He had the song in the...

298
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:39,520
It's Apple D. App from the Black Eyed Peas.

299
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:40,520
Yeah.

300
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:46,480
But the whole song is about him being president and then ODB's verse is just like him just

301
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:47,880
being ODB.

302
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:54,880
I love that Black Eyed Peas is just, it's Fergie, what's his name?

303
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:55,880
Will.i.am.

304
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:57,880
Will.i.am and then like two robots.

305
00:14:57,880 --> 00:15:00,640
Taboo and Apple the App.

306
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:05,440
Yeah, it's one of the twins from the Matrix.

307
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:07,640
It's the dark version of the Matrix.

308
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:10,520
Yeah, yeah, yeah, fucking rocks man.

309
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:12,120
They make good music man.

310
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:15,560
I got a feeling, such a great music video.

311
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:18,140
The idea that time would stop.

312
00:15:18,140 --> 00:15:20,000
I have to feeling.

313
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,880
I have to feel you.

314
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:23,200
That was the original one.

315
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:23,720
Yeah.

316
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:25,640
The original one was I am retarded.

317
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:26,140
Yeah.

318
00:15:26,140 --> 00:15:26,640
[LAUGHTER]

319
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:28,600
Yeah, just every Black Eyed Peas song.

320
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:30,800
[LAUGHTER]

321
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:33,560
They bring it in every single time.

322
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:35,440
The record producer's like, can we just not--

323
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:38,400
Why do you guys keep writing that?

324
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:40,480
It's funny.

325
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:43,920
Look, we made parody songs before you put us in commercials,

326
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:44,420
all right?

327
00:15:44,420 --> 00:15:46,520
(laughing)

328
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:50,160
- We just wanted, we wanted to have our own My Bologna.

329
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:51,920
We wanted to have our own Eat It.

330
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:54,500
That's why we're called the Black Eyed Peas.

331
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:56,560
We wanna write food-based parody songs.

332
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:57,960
(laughing)

333
00:15:57,960 --> 00:16:00,320
- Yeah, they were like the Lonely Island at first,

334
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:03,000
but just all their stuff was, yeah.

335
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,320
- Gotta get that poop, poop, poop.

336
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:06,200
- Yeah.

337
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:08,000
- That poop, poop, crap.

338
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:08,840
- They had a--

339
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:10,600
- I got that down, Sandra.

340
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:12,520
(laughing)

341
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:17,320
Yeah, "Where is the love" was originally "Where is the bud" and it was a Smoker's Anthem.

342
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:18,320
Mm-hmm.

343
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:19,320
Yeah.

344
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:20,320
That one's not true.

345
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:22,320
"Where is the cud" and it's about a cow's tongue.

346
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:24,320
Yeah, it's about a cow's tongue.

347
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:25,320
Yeah.

348
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:26,320
"Where is the cud, moo-oo-oo-oo."

349
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:27,320
That was how this song went.

350
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:29,520
That's such a funny idea.

351
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:34,520
Just every Black Eyed Peas song is just ableist before it hits the radio.

352
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:35,520
Yeah.

353
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:36,520

386
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:27,760
This was list, but I have a dirty mind. This list was sent by mumble crap and the discord crap. What's up, baby?

387
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:33,120
Thanks mumble. Yeah, we do. We have a channel where you can just send lists and we'll send them to we're picking stuff from that

388
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:38,880
Yeah, you don't have to do the work anymore. You work for us you pigs. It's so hard to

389
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:46,480
find a list. We did use up a lot of stuff. We've been doing this for a while. Dude, I

390
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:49,760
wonder if we're going to hit 100 while we're in quarantine. Fuck, I hope not. Oh dude,

391
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:55,680
if we don't have anything planned. By the time this comes out it'll be 95. I don't think 95 yet.

392
00:18:55,680 --> 00:19:01,920
Maybe. Yeah, I think our last one was 91. Yeah, our last one was 91. I'll fly up for the 100.

393
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:03,920
if this last one was 90, what happened to this one?

394
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:04,420
Don't fly up.

395
00:19:04,420 --> 00:19:04,920
I'll fly up.

396
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:06,420
Drive up. Don't fly up.

397
00:19:06,420 --> 00:19:07,920
It's way more expensive to drive.

398
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:11,920
Yeah, it's way more expensive to drive, but you have less risk of getting Corona.

399
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:14,420
I don't care. I'm badass.

400
00:19:14,420 --> 00:19:16,420
I'm not gonna do it with you if you get on a plane.

401
00:19:16,420 --> 00:19:17,420
I'm the Terminator.

402
00:19:17,420 --> 00:19:20,920
I'm the Determinator. I determine who has Corona.

403
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:21,420
Yeah.

404
00:19:21,420 --> 00:19:23,920
Corona. Corona. You guys both have it.

405
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:25,920
You just pointed behind me.

406
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:28,920
Yeah, there's a guy behind you who's about to infect you. Look out.

407
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:30,920
Oh, it's you. Oh, no.

408
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:35,760
This one is top 10 things to sell in school.

409
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:37,800

410
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:38,800
You have a cat.

411
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:40,800
Get the fucking cat off the mic now.

412
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:42,800

413
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:44,240
Oh, the cat's purring away.

414
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:49,000
He's purring into the mic.

415
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,000
He stopped.

416
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,000
You made him stop.

417
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,640
We should get a dog.

418
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:55,800
We should get a podcast dog that lives in the internet.

419
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:57,680
Let's get a virtual dog.

420
00:19:57,680 --> 00:19:59,800

423
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:12,880
Fucking bitch. I've not called him Leonard like since I got him. I like him more if I call him Leonard.

424
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:18,720
Yeah. The fact that you gave him like an eight-year-old's name for an animal. Well, no, because he's a fuck. Puts me off.

425
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:20,720
They're both fuckers.

426
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:26,840
I just, you know. An eight-year-old wouldn't be allowed to name its pet fucker. Call it the fudger.

427
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:31,080
Call him super my dog when we adopted her her original name was fudge

428
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:40,020
I feel like that I'd name a dog fudge. I'd laugh at it for a day, and then I'd be like yeah

429
00:20:40,020 --> 00:20:42,740
Can you imagine a call foot yeah yelling that across the playground?

430
00:20:42,740 --> 00:20:47,280

But in Spanish, but the first one that he landed on was like Spanish for lunch

didn't isn't what's his name good i think i i think i was just sick and i

497
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:57,920
think i'm feeling very sick

498
00:24:57,920 --> 00:25:00,480
when you went fishing I think I rested.

499
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:02,000
Because I know we were...

500
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:05,360
Oh yeah, we were waiting for the Thanos copter to charge.

501
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:09,440
Because I remember that weekend we just ate like utter shit.

502
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:11,040
Oh yeah, I was on my food tour.

503
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:12,320
On my highway food tour.

504
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:15,760
Cameron has a weak body.

505
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:17,120
I do have a weak stomach.

506
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:19,360
Cameron eating Jollibee was the worst thing he could have ever done.

507
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:20,160
Yeah.

508
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:22,400
It did ruin me.

509
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:26,000
I mean I don't eat healthy but I don't eat like that crazy.

510
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,200
I don't eat fried chicken or anything.

511
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:29,440
I was prepared for that.

512
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:30,440
Yeah, yeah.

513
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:34,000
Patrick was eating lead for two weeks, just a stomach lining.

514
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,000
Yeah.

515
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:40,400
I mean, but also, again, as we said, I guess at this point, a week and a half ago or whatever,

516
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:45,440
that Patrick, you've eaten so much crazy shit in your life that you're just immune, dude.

517
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:46,440
Yeah, I feel like-

518
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:47,600
But when I do get sick, I fuck up.

519
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:50,600
I feel like if I shot a bullet at you, your body would absorb it like T2.

520
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:55,600
No, I should get killed by a bullet, but if you tried to poison my food, I would survive.

521
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:56,600
Yeah.

522
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:57,100
King.

523
00:25:57,100 --> 00:25:57,600
Yep.

524
00:25:57,600 --> 00:25:58,600
Like a king.

525
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:00,100
Like an unkillable king.

526
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:04,100
Kings, the whole point is they don't survive, that's why they have the poison tester.

527
00:26:04,100 --> 00:26:06,600
No, the kings survive.

528
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:09,600
The poison tester is King Koopa.

529
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:11,600
King Koopa never got poisoned.

530
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:12,600
He did.

531
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:13,600
No, we should get that fat fuck.

532
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:14,600
What did he get poisoned by?

533
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:15,600
Mario's fists.

534
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:16,600
Pfft.

535
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:17,600
Not a poison.

536
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:18,600
And his fire.

537
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:19,600
Not a poison.

538
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:21,600
Alright, we didn't even talk about knives.

539
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:22,600
I'm gonna go fuck about knives.

540
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:25,600
This is a great idea so we can kill the teacher or commit suicide.

541
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:33,000
side. Whoa. 31 upvotes. Yeah. Dude, I tried, I had a knife for a little bit but then it

542
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:39,680
got, you know like when a salt lamp gets sweaty? No. No. If it gets too humid in a

543
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:44,240
room a salt lamp start like. Melting sort of. Yeah, melting a little bit and my knife

544
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:49,700

550
00:27:15,020 --> 00:27:17,300

551
00:27:17,300 --> 00:27:21,080
a knife on you. My older brother used to have, he had butterfly knives.

552
00:27:21,080 --> 00:27:27,180
That's sick. That's dumb. I think Dom used to be able to do tricks with butterfly knives.

553
00:27:27,180 --> 00:27:33,420
What? That shit's so awesome. It's funny that you just fucking chop your fingers off.

554
00:27:33,420 --> 00:27:40,740
Yeah. Like Spy from TF2. Yeah exactly like Spy from TF2. I saw that in that game and

555
00:27:40,740 --> 00:27:46,380
And then the next day I looked up butterfly knife prices.

556
00:27:46,380 --> 00:27:47,380
Listen to this comment.

557
00:27:47,380 --> 00:27:51,540
"I want knives so we can do whatever we want and threaten the teachers to do things for

558
00:27:51,540 --> 00:27:52,540
us.

559
00:27:52,540 --> 00:27:55,940
Also so we can bring protection from people who break into our school, but mainly the

560
00:27:55,940 --> 00:28:01,420
first thing about threatening the teachers."

561
00:28:01,420 --> 00:28:02,740
This is a horrible idea.

562
00:28:02,740 --> 00:28:05,900
Please add real items since I would love to actually sell items.

563
00:28:05,900 --> 00:28:06,900
Thank you.

564
00:28:06,900 --> 00:28:07,900
Hi.

565
00:28:07,900 --> 00:28:12,700
Hi, welcome to my item shop. It's just a locker that says items.

566
00:28:12,700 --> 00:28:15,100
My school item shop. Would you like a potion?

567
00:28:15,100 --> 00:28:18,700
I have a potion. It is equal parts.

568
00:28:18,700 --> 00:28:21,580
We as a young nation need to overthrow the teachers.

569
00:28:21,580 --> 00:28:27,340
God, every time you cough.

570
00:28:27,340 --> 00:28:28,620
Yeah, it's putting me on edge.

571
00:28:28,620 --> 00:28:32,940
I know that this episode will age poorly when you are dead or...

572
00:28:32,940 --> 00:28:36,460
I don't have it. I literally have not left the house.

573
00:28:36,460 --> 00:28:40,620
Dude, you have it. My boner is pointing directly towards you.

574
00:28:40,620 --> 00:28:41,180
Because you're gay?

575
00:28:41,180 --> 00:28:42,300
Because it senses danger.

576
00:28:42,300 --> 00:28:43,500
Yeah.

577
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:48,060
"Lol at all these hate comments. My dad in high school actually sell knives."

578
00:28:48,060 --> 00:28:51,900
I like to think his dad currently, like, goes to the high school.

579
00:28:51,900 --> 00:28:52,540
His dad sells knives.

580
00:28:52,540 --> 00:28:55,180
The high school selling knives. Is he on your shoulder?

581
00:28:55,180 --> 00:28:58,140
Yes. This one I like.

582
00:28:58,140 --> 00:28:58,620
Yeah, he's...

583
00:28:58,620 --> 00:29:02,780
Awesome. It's great. My friend always asks for a knife, but I don't have one.

584
00:29:03,660 --> 00:29:08,940
I want knives so I can slip my fist and rub my blood in my enemy's faces. We

585
00:29:08,940 --> 00:29:14,060
should do blood brothers. Yeah yeah breaking news murder attack in a school

586
00:29:14,060 --> 00:29:21,740

00:29:39,220 --> 00:29:45,540
This just in, the girls bathroom doesn't have any urinals.

591
00:29:45,540 --> 00:29:49,500
What the fuck? The teacher's apple had a worm.

592
00:29:49,500 --> 00:29:52,980

600
00:30:21,220 --> 00:30:24,760
We're going to kill the teachers with the

601
00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:32,720
knives. Never a good idea says anonymous. Honestly, I wish I knew about this

602
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:35,960
earlier knife is for ending people life.

603
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:41,960
That's a good chance. We can kill those haters other kids could kill you

604
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:58,640
Sausage lover 99. Add me on Xbox Brazil nut 72. That's such a good Xbox username.

It's E Doran1234. So if you want to add me on Xbox Live, E Doran1234.

608
00:31:16,100 --> 00:31:24,160
I think my Minecraft name, which was the only like, or like Steam, was Tenebrae Omega.

609
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:28,280
My Steam name is still Wargers. It's still my YouTube poopname.

610
00:31:28,280 --> 00:31:35,660
My Xbox name is SpamXHavoc. That's pretty sick. I think my PlayStation name is CamFedder.

611
00:31:35,660 --> 00:31:41,180
I don't know, it might not be. But I made that like a year ago, so that's why.

612
00:31:41,180 --> 00:31:42,180
That's your name.

613
00:31:42,180 --> 00:31:43,180
Yeah, that's my name.

614
00:31:43,180 --> 00:31:44,620
Yeah, when you grow up, you stop.

615
00:31:44,620 --> 00:31:46,220
My RuneScape name was Penny Picker.

616
00:31:46,220 --> 00:31:48,340
Oh, yeah, he told us about that.

617
00:31:48,340 --> 00:31:49,340
That's cool.

618
00:31:49,340 --> 00:31:50,340
Because you were going to make that documentary.

619
00:31:50,340 --> 00:31:54,540
No, that was different. No, Penny Picker, that was like a... Back in the day, that was

620
00:31:54,540 --> 00:31:59,820
like a something, like a moshing move was the Penny Picker, and I thought it was cool.

621
00:31:59,820 --> 00:32:04,460
In a couple of weeks, we will, Caleb will be making Chump Change.

622
00:32:04,460 --> 00:32:10,180
It's coming to theaters near you. It'll come to your local. Michael Moore has backed it. Yeah. Yeah, Michael

623
00:32:10,180 --> 00:32:14,540
Yeah, as long as I film the whole thing in Flint, then he's agreed to do it. Here's a comment

624
00:32:14,540 --> 00:32:19,680
This idea is very shocking. I do see this happening in the near future if students keep being like this

625
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:22,660
Good luck teachers slash haters regards

626
00:32:22,660 --> 00:32:28,560
If students keep being like this damn students be doing this students be do be like this

627
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:30,360
What's number two? Wait, wait one more

628
00:32:30,360 --> 00:32:35,520
more ye because I would really love to walk into school with a M9 bayonet and

629
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:37,800
kill my business teacher she is a massive bitch.

630
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:50,400
Dude, that fucking rules. God damn dude. A bayonet. That's jumping like a level.

631
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:54,560
That is how nowadays that's how you get away with a mass shooting. Bring in a

632
00:32:54,560 --> 00:32:58,560
gun that people would just assume you're doing show and tell with. Yeah. Like a

633
00:32:58,560 --> 00:33:01,460
- Yeah, I just be like, oh, he's just.

634
00:33:01,460 --> 00:33:05,300
- Imagine a kid just pulling up with a musket at school,

635
00:33:05,300 --> 00:33:06,140
though.

636
00:33:06,140 --> 00:33:07,160
- Yeah, that'd be sick.

637
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:09,300
- There was a kid at my school who tried to walk around,

638
00:33:09,300 --> 00:33:11,740
or he tried to get it approved,

639
00:33:11,740 --> 00:33:16,140
but he wanted to do a Nerf war for the senior prank,

640
00:33:16,140 --> 00:33:18,900
and he set up like a whole rule system

641
00:33:18,900 --> 00:33:20,340
of how the senior prank would work,

642
00:33:20,340 --> 00:33:22,380
and then I just remember everybody in this,

643
00:33:22,380 --> 00:33:25,300
like the seniors 2015 group just being like,

644
00:33:25,300 --> 00:33:27,620
yeah, we don't wanna do this.

645
00:33:27,620 --> 00:33:29,220
I was just like, oh man, he--

646
00:33:29,220 --> 00:33:30,900
- What was the senior prank when you were here?

647
00:33:30,900 --> 00:33:35,120
- Senior prank was, we had a rave in a classroom.

648
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:37,140
- Whoa, dude, that's insane.

649
00:33:37,140 --> 00:33:39,740
- Yeah, well, they had to, there was apparently

650
00:33:39,740 --> 00:33:41,500
a prank so bad at our school that they had

651
00:33:41,500 --> 00:33:43,180
to approve our pranks.

652
00:33:43,180 --> 00:33:44,100
- That's pretty funny.

653
00:33:44,100 --> 00:33:44,940
- Whoa.

654
00:33:44,940 --> 00:33:45,780
- So--

655
00:33:45,780 --> 00:33:46,700
- Wait, what do you want?

656
00:33:46,700 --> 00:33:48,020
- Prank approved.

657
00:33:48,020 --> 00:33:48,860
- Number two--

658
00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:49,860
- We had to get our pranks approved,

659
00:33:49,860 --> 00:33:52,540
and then after the rave thing happened,

660
00:33:52,540 --> 00:33:54,660
me and my friends just ran around the school

661
00:33:54,660 --> 00:33:56,900

to everything but cancer at this point.

679
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,680
- Yeah, I don't think any of my older--

680
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:09,920
- Well, you smoked cigarettes since you were like 11, right?

681
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:10,760
- 12.

682
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:11,580
- 12.

683
00:35:11,580 --> 00:35:12,420
- Yeah.

684
00:35:12,420 --> 00:35:13,520
- How much, what was your peak?

685
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:14,400
- Most cigarettes?

686
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:16,320
- Like in a day, how many were you smoking?

687
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:18,560
- Oh, I was like, before I quit,

688
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:21,120
it was like almost two packs a day.

689
00:35:21,120 --> 00:35:21,960
- Whoa!

690
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:23,280
- No, it was almost like--

691
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:24,280
- That's old man numbers.

692
00:35:24,280 --> 00:35:27,000
- Two packs every two days.

693
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:27,920
- To a pack a day.

694
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:30,160
(laughing)

695
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:32,940
- He's thinking.

696
00:35:32,940 --> 00:35:33,760
- No, he's thinking, hold on.

697
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:34,600
- He's doing the math.

698
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:35,720
- Wait, no, no, no, no.

699
00:35:35,720 --> 00:35:37,680
- No, two packs every two days, not a pack a day.

700
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:41,800
No, I did seven packs a week, not a pack a day.

701
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:44,560
- There was a point where it was like

702
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:47,720
a pack every other day.

703
00:35:47,720 --> 00:35:49,960
I think that might have been my most.

704
00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:52,080
but there was a week where i did smoke it

705
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:54,960
to how did you get it did with someone is not card you

706
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:58,300
or do you steal it from people uh... no my mom spokesman

707
00:35:58,300 --> 00:35:59,200
policy just

708
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:02,720
so until i turned to come on the way turned eighteen

709
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:04,760
that's when i got that

710
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:06,560
because there is any good ideas

711
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:08,960
you five dollars in new hampshire

712
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:10,880
and i'm eighteen

713
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:13,160
so what else you can do exactly what i was a

714
00:36:13,160 --> 00:36:16,720
they just sit in my room and play lord of the rings on gamecube and smoke six

715
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:18,640
- True, so you could smoke inside.

716
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:19,480
- Yeah.

717
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:20,800
- You had a Cigs inside house.

718
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:21,640
That's crazy, man.

719
00:36:21,640 --> 00:36:22,960
- Yeah, I had a Cigs inside house.

720
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:23,800
- Fucking insane.

721
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:26,000
- Twice as much cancer.

722
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:26,840
- Oh my God, dude, Cigs inside.

723
00:36:26,840 --> 00:36:29,600
- Secondhand smoke and Cigs inside.

724
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:31,040
- Yeah, that rocks.

725
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:34,840
- But I would play, I would sleep on a mattress on the floor

726
00:36:34,840 --> 00:36:37,280
and I only had like, I had just shelves

727
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:38,600
that I put all my clothes on.

728
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:39,440
- Yeah.

729
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:40,280
- And I would just smoke Cigs

730
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:42,600
and play GameCube all summer.

731
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:43,440
- Damn.

732
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:44,760
- I wanna go back, dude.

733
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:45,600
- Absolutely boss, dude.

734
00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:47,040
- Dude, I wanna go back.

735
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:48,540
- Absolutely, boss.

736
00:36:48,540 --> 00:36:52,040
- This comment says, "If your school doesn't allow gum,

737
00:36:52,040 --> 00:36:52,880
"go for it.

738
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:54,880
"Just try not to get caught or you're dead."

739
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:55,920
- Oh yeah, that was a--

740
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:58,240
- Gum was illegal in your school?

741
00:36:58,240 --> 00:36:59,080
- I, so I--

742
00:36:59,080 --> 00:37:00,520
- Death penalty?

743
00:37:00,520 --> 00:37:04,360
- I used to chew gum 'cause I had a 504 plan,

744
00:37:04,360 --> 00:37:05,840
which was like for kids with ADHD.

745
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:07,120
- Oh yeah, dude, I had a 504 too.

746
00:37:07,120 --> 00:37:08,840
- Yeah, so I had a 504 plan.

747
00:37:08,840 --> 00:37:11,800
Part of my 504 was I could chew gum during tests,

748
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:15,060
but my math teacher, seventh grade,

749
00:37:15,060 --> 00:37:18,580
Mr. McCarthy went on paternity leave

750
00:37:18,580 --> 00:37:19,900
so he could watch his kid,

751
00:37:19,900 --> 00:37:22,500
and we had this substitute named Mrs. Williams.

752
00:37:22,500 --> 00:37:25,260
Mrs. Williams was one of the worst women

753
00:37:25,260 --> 00:37:26,620
I've ever met in my life.

754
00:37:26,620 --> 00:37:31,820
Mrs. Williams accused me of,

755
00:37:31,820 --> 00:37:33,180
'cause if you didn't do your homework

756
00:37:33,180 --> 00:37:34,320
you had to get your mom to sign it,

757
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:37,600
she accused me of ripping the page out of my book

758
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:38,940
when I did the homework.

759
00:37:38,940 --> 00:37:41,420
Dude, she was a fucking nutcase.

760
00:37:41,420 --> 00:37:42,860
And then Mrs. Smith.

761
00:37:42,860 --> 00:37:44,260

calls Greek people diner monkeys and I've had that stuck in my diner monkey is the

787
00:39:56,040 --> 00:40:01,120
greatest European slur. Yeah, yeah, I'm holding out. I'm holding on to that one.

00:40:01,160 --> 00:40:03,480
for the first time I ever meet a Greek person.

789
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:04,600

790
00:40:04,600 --> 00:40:05,440
Hey, what's up, you're a diner monkey.

Yeah, that's a good idea.

796
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:15,560

- Yeah, number three, slime.

810
00:40:30,380 --> 00:40:31,380
We sell some slime.

811
00:40:31,380 --> 00:40:33,380
Kids just have different problems than we do.

812
00:40:33,380 --> 00:40:36,580
There was slime, I'll say it, when I was growing up, slime didn't exist, man.

813
00:40:36,580 --> 00:40:38,380
Yeah, we didn't do slime, we did Oobleck.

814
00:40:38,380 --> 00:40:39,380
Oobleck.

815
00:40:39,380 --> 00:40:40,380
What the fuck, man?

816
00:40:40,380 --> 00:40:41,380
You remember doing Oobleck?

817
00:40:41,380 --> 00:40:43,380
We did Oobleck in science class with my weird...

818
00:40:43,380 --> 00:40:46,880
The book, the Oobleck book scared the fucking shit out of me when I was a kid.

819
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:48,380
The part when the Oobleck goes in his mouth...

820
00:40:48,380 --> 00:40:49,380
There's an Oobleck book?

821
00:40:49,380 --> 00:40:51,780
Yeah, it's a Dr. Seuss book.

822
00:40:51,780 --> 00:40:52,780
You never read Oobleck?

823
00:40:52,780 --> 00:40:54,780
No, I didn't know it was based off a Dr. Seuss book.

824
00:40:54,780 --> 00:40:56,380
Okay, so it's based off a Dr. Seuss book...

825
00:40:56,380 --> 00:40:59,380
I thought they were just trying to teach us about non-nutrient food.

826
00:40:59,380 --> 00:41:02,340
there's a kingdom where i thought they were just trying to do some on

827
00:41:02,340 --> 00:41:03,140
newtonian fluid.

828
00:41:03,140 --> 00:41:09,780
There's a you fast talking hog shut up.

829
00:41:09,780 --> 00:41:15,380
There's a book and it's about like a kingdom where this mysterious slime

830
00:41:15,380 --> 00:41:19,180
rains down that just ruins everything a touch. It's like super sticky. They

831
00:41:19,180 --> 00:41:22,580
can't clean it off and like it like and nobody can't like everything gets stuck

832
00:41:22,580 --> 00:41:25,680
everybody gets stuck in the oob like and there's a part where some day he

833
00:41:25,720 --> 00:41:29,800
swallows an oobleck and it like sticks up his insides and he can't talk and he's

834
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:35,440
like gonna die it's crazy dude. They tell me about that's like the Shel Silverstein

835
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:39,600
poem about eating peanut butter you eat a peanut butter sandwich and your mouth is

836
00:41:39,600 --> 00:41:46,520
stuck closed and you can't even breathe and your parents won't help. Scary stuff.

837
00:41:46,520 --> 00:41:51,200
Dude every Shel Silverstein when I was a kid they scared the fuck out of me.

838
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:55,500
All of his, the concept for all of his poems are like,

839
00:41:55,500 --> 00:41:57,880
what if I wrote a poem about a guy with no face?

840
00:41:57,880 --> 00:41:58,720
- Yeah.

841
00:41:58,720 --> 00:42:00,800
- What if a monster lived inside of a kid?

842
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:01,800
- Yeah, what if there was like--

843
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:03,660
- And then, yeah, all you have to do is read his poem

844
00:42:03,660 --> 00:42:05,280
and then just imagine his face.

845
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:07,280
- What if the street stopped?

846
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:08,120
- Dude, that was like--

847
00:42:08,120 --> 00:42:09,680
(laughing)

848
00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:12,360
Dude, that was the, that's still such a funny part

849
00:42:12,360 --> 00:42:14,600
of Diary of a Wimpy Kid.

850
00:42:14,600 --> 00:42:16,960
Where they just have the drawing of him

851
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:18,800
and it's like he looks like a pirate.

852
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:24,920
It's so funny dude. Yeah, he's a crazy looking guy. I would not like the guy anywhere near

853
00:42:24,920 --> 00:42:29,920
my kids. Oh, except to read. No, just Shel Silverstein. He's not just on the back of

854
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:33,640
the book. He only existed on the back of the book. No, but they just kept using the same

855
00:42:33,640 --> 00:42:36,720
photo of him. Yeah, they used the same photo of him and he's wearing some big fur coat

856
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:41,560
and he's got a giant beard. Yeah, and crazy veneers. Crazy veneers, bald head, giant eyebrows.

857
00:42:41,560 --> 00:42:45,880
Okay wait, these comments are, something's going on with slime here. Listen to these

858
00:42:45,880 --> 00:42:50,560
comments. I'll just read them in a row. Everyone sells slime. What? My best

859
00:42:50,560 --> 00:42:55,080
friend did and got a hundred dollars each semester. What the f- It's a good idea to

860
00:42:55,080 --> 00:43:00,680
sell slime because a lot of kids like it. So slime, so okay, so my little

861
00:43:00,680 --> 00:43:05,400

862
00:43:05,400 --> 00:43:09,040
younger sibling loves slime. It's because of those Instagram videos. No, it's because kids are being made

863
00:43:09,040 --> 00:43:13,120
autistic by the Internet. Yeah. And slime calms them down. And they just make colored slime now.

864
00:43:13,120 --> 00:43:20,640
Yeah, yeah, it's like a five years younger than us. Yeah, it's like it's like how like like you remember those cubes that were like fidget

865
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:25,640
Yeah, it was it's like that but yeah for just like devolved. Yeah. Yeah

866
00:43:25,640 --> 00:43:29,720
Yeah, every kid is autistic nowadays. I don't say that it is

867
00:43:29,720 --> 00:43:31,760
I would it is everyone or 80d

868
00:43:31,760 --> 00:43:36,080
This is this this like the comments on this read like they're coming out of like an alternate universe

869
00:43:36,080 --> 00:43:39,200
Like we just found like yeah, like listen, this is crazy

870
00:43:42,200 --> 00:43:46,360
someone's pretending to like so they're trying to send a message like this

871
00:43:46,360 --> 00:43:50,760

day and got banned from it my god dude we got banned from slime is a really

875
00:44:10,640 --> 00:44:14,480
good idea you can get a lot of money and everyone likes it I sold slime in

876
00:44:14,480 --> 00:44:19,780
fourth grade I made like $100 a week I made $78 off of slime selling in two

877
00:44:19,780 --> 00:44:24,040
weeks that's the only person I believe because that's a rain that's a normal

878
00:44:24,040 --> 00:44:29,360
number yeah I will sell this tomorrow I have literally made about $14 and I

879
00:44:29,360 --> 00:44:34,280
started five days great idea I love slime I like slime it's a good stress

880
00:44:34,280 --> 00:44:40,520
reliever yes yep yes I want slime slime when can I start I like it but not

881
00:44:40,520 --> 00:44:44,440
prefer it at school. I will just stick to the regular learning system or book fairs."

882
00:44:44,440 --> 00:44:48,120
Kids should not be so stressed that the only thing that can calm them down is slime.

883
00:44:48,120 --> 00:44:53,000
This is so insane, dude! "I am selling slime and I have made 100 pounds in two weeks. X.

884
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:57,640
Wow, you should try it out. X. I made 50 pounds starting a slime business in school."

885
00:44:57,640 --> 00:45:03,160
God damn it, dude. Imagine going back in time and explaining this to Ronald Reagan.

886
00:45:03,160 --> 00:45:07,960
"My friend sells slime in school and made $50 each week and by the end of the month she had 200 bucks."

887
00:45:07,960 --> 00:45:11,720
One day in industry is going to be kids selling slime to each other in school.

888
00:45:11,720 --> 00:45:16,920
That's how kids are like, that's like when the people in like Brazil like hack Minecraft

889
00:45:16,920 --> 00:45:21,640
accounts and then they just kind of mine for gold and then sell the mine or the runescape accounts.

890
00:45:21,640 --> 00:45:22,040
Yeah.

891
00:45:22,040 --> 00:45:26,040
And then they mine or they get like all the gold and then they sell the runescape account for money.

892
00:45:26,040 --> 00:45:30,040
There's like a concept of like a David Foster Wallace novel.

893
00:45:30,040 --> 00:45:32,680
It's kids selling slime to provide for their family.

894
00:45:32,680 --> 00:45:34,360
Kids have a slime economy.

895
00:45:34,360 --> 00:45:34,600
Yeah.

896
00:45:34,600 --> 00:45:36,920
They start slime businesses.

897
00:45:36,920 --> 00:45:37,160
Yeah.

898
00:45:37,160 --> 00:45:41,360
yeah those comments weirded me out yeah bizarre dude we look let's look at

903
00:46:05,360 --> 00:46:06,360
Oh my god.

904
00:46:06,360 --> 00:46:11,120
Because you guys, I knew in middle school when I was like in sixth grade, the seventh grader,

905
00:46:11,120 --> 00:46:13,680
this kid Bob, he was like one of my closest friends.

906
00:46:13,680 --> 00:46:16,920
Dude, if you're in the seventh grade, you're going by Bob, not Bobby?

907
00:46:16,920 --> 00:46:17,920
No, he was Bob.

908
00:46:17,920 --> 00:46:18,920
That's some fucked up shit.

909
00:46:18,920 --> 00:46:19,920
He was Bob.

910
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:23,320
We were in a band together that we never made a song or played any music, but we were in

911
00:46:23,320 --> 00:46:24,320
a band together.

912
00:46:24,320 --> 00:46:28,920
He sold weed and the way that he would sell weed was, this is like such a sick like 2008

913
00:46:28,920 --> 00:46:35,160
thing, he would bring weed to school in tiny bags and he would hide them in the tag of his

914
00:46:35,160 --> 00:46:39,120
new era fitted hat. Nice. Because it was like a little pouch and then he would

915
00:46:39,120 --> 00:46:44,320
come into math class every day and be like, "Caleb, smell my hat." And so he would

916
00:46:44,320 --> 00:46:47,040
pass the hat around the class and all the kids would like smell the hat and

917
00:46:47,040 --> 00:46:50,480
then someone would be like, "This hat's great," like in front of the teacher, "This hat's

918
00:46:50,480 --> 00:46:56,400
great. I'll give you ten dollars for this hat." Damn. Yeah, man. Bob is a genius, dude.

919
00:46:56,400 --> 00:47:03,040
Yeah. Yeah. I think he's dead. Yeah. Yeah. Nice. Damn. That was like my main drug

920
00:47:03,040 --> 00:47:07,480
dealer friend in middle school. Yeah. The only drug, like the one drug dealer at my

921
00:47:07,480 --> 00:47:11,880
school lived in my neighborhood and my mom hated him so I couldn't. So you

922
00:47:11,880 --> 00:47:16,120
couldn't buy any drugs? No. When did you first smoke weed? I talked about it

923
00:47:16,120 --> 00:47:20,680
before I first smoked weed when I was like 13. Oh yeah. At a basketball game. Yeah.

924
00:47:20,680 --> 00:47:24,220
Yeah. No I was already smoking cigs so I was like let's go to the next level. Yeah.

925
00:47:24,220 --> 00:47:28,600
I didn't drink until I was 15 though. Yeah I didn't drink for a long time. No I

926
00:47:28,600 --> 00:47:34,120
I drank when I was 13. I think I was 16 when I was 13. I was 17 when I drank and smoked for the first

927
00:47:34,120 --> 00:47:40,280
time. I had a pineapple soda mixed with a vodka. Whoa. At my sister's 16th birthday. My first time

928
00:47:40,280 --> 00:47:46,040
ever drinking I stole, my mom had like, somebody gave her a bottle of Hennessy and they never drank

929
00:47:46,040 --> 00:47:52,280
it. So me and my friend John, we stole a, we stole like just a bunch, and I didn't know how to drink.

930
00:47:52,280 --> 00:47:58,400
I was just like this alcohol, so I poured Hennessy into a giant solo cup and then

931
00:47:58,400 --> 00:48:01,980
is there something interesting happening outside? I was just standing out there. Yeah, I thought they were

932
00:48:01,980 --> 00:48:06,360
looking in the window. I poured Hennessy into two solo cups, like all the way to

933
00:48:06,360 --> 00:48:11,120
the top and it was like the most disgusting thing ever, but I was like I

934
00:48:11,120 --> 00:48:15,680
guess this is what it's like and we both like blacked out and then I remember I

935
00:48:15,680 --> 00:48:18,840
was like we went for a walk on the beach and we blacked out and then I woke up

936
00:48:18,840 --> 00:48:25,920
and I was running in the rain. It was like pouring down rain. I was sprinting and

937
00:48:25,920 --> 00:48:31,440
John was like ahead of me and he like fell over and I had to like drag him like

938
00:48:31,440 --> 00:48:34,800
into my house and then I like got him like on my bed and I was like okay he's

939
00:48:34,800 --> 00:48:39,640
asleep I'm gonna go vomit and then I went to the bathroom I was vomiting for

940
00:48:39,640 --> 00:48:45,960
a little while and then I heard just like something outside just like I was

941
00:48:45,960 --> 00:48:50,220
like what the fuck is that and I opened the door to the bathroom and John was

942
00:48:50,220 --> 00:48:54,280
completely naked at my brother's electronic drum kit in the living room

943
00:48:54,280 --> 00:48:59,960

I get my thingy going.

947
00:49:17,860 --> 00:49:20,600
Maybe offer the principal a toke after school too.

948
00:49:20,600 --> 00:49:22,560
Principal, you want some of this?

949
00:49:22,560 --> 00:49:25,200
I would never share my weed with the principal.

950
00:49:25,200 --> 00:49:27,880
Never dude, that's what cops do.

951
00:49:27,880 --> 00:49:30,880
You're all wet, you have never touched weed and you won't sell it.

952
00:49:30,880 --> 00:49:34,120
What about wet with PCP?

953
00:49:34,120 --> 00:49:36,400
I think wet is maybe a new slang that we don't understand.

954
00:49:36,400 --> 00:49:41,720
I love weed, a gum over the seven tree of a dog.

955
00:49:41,720 --> 00:49:43,480
That's literally what being high does to your brain.

956
00:49:43,480 --> 00:49:45,140
- Yeah, pretty much.

957
00:49:45,140 --> 00:49:48,860
- I bought a pound of weed

958
00:49:48,860 --> 00:49:53,160
and also ordered 100 pre-rolled cones,

959
00:49:53,160 --> 00:49:55,620
stuffed them and sold them for $5 each.

960
00:49:55,620 --> 00:49:56,880
Think of that.

961
00:49:56,880 --> 00:49:58,960
1,600 pound, $5 each jay,

962
00:49:58,960 --> 00:50:03,720
which is .3 of a gram.

963
00:50:03,720 --> 00:50:05,420
That's killer profit.

964
00:50:05,420 --> 00:50:07,620
That's if you don't smoke your supply.

965
00:50:07,620 --> 00:50:09,380
Stay lifted, by the way.

966
00:50:09,380 --> 00:50:12,120
There's 453 grams in a pound.

967
00:50:12,120 --> 00:50:13,960
- Wow. - Nice.

968
00:50:13,960 --> 00:50:14,800
- That's a cop.

969
00:50:14,800 --> 00:50:16,840
(laughing)

970
00:50:16,840 --> 00:50:17,680
- Yeah.

971
00:50:17,680 --> 00:50:19,440
- There's a funny picture of me holding a pound of weed.

972
00:50:19,440 --> 00:50:20,280
- Yeah, that's a good picture.

973
00:50:20,280 --> 00:50:21,480
- It's a lot more than you would think.

974
00:50:21,480 --> 00:50:22,400
- It's huge.

975
00:50:22,400 --> 00:50:23,240
- It's so much.

976
00:50:23,240 --> 00:50:24,060
- Yeah.

977
00:50:24,060 --> 00:50:25,640
- Yeah, I just stepped out of the shower one day

978
00:50:25,640 --> 00:50:26,640
and my brother was like,

979
00:50:26,640 --> 00:50:28,560
"Do you wanna hold a pound of weed?"

980
00:50:28,560 --> 00:50:29,960
I'm like, "Meh, sure."

981
00:50:29,960 --> 00:50:32,120
- I would hold a pound of weed if I could.

982
00:50:32,120 --> 00:50:33,840
- Yeah, you know how heavy it is?

983
00:50:33,840 --> 00:50:35,080
- No, it's a pound.

984
00:50:35,080 --> 00:50:36,120
- Yeah, I gotcha.

985
00:50:36,120 --> 00:50:38,000
Got your ass.

986
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:39,560
- It's probably less heavy.

987
00:50:39,560 --> 00:50:41,500
- Number five is snacks.

988
00:50:41,500 --> 00:50:42,340
I've sold snacks.

989
00:50:42,340 --> 00:50:43,180
What am I, the vending machine?

990
00:50:43,180 --> 00:50:44,000
Yeah.

991
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:44,980
Yeah, what is he, the vending machine?

992
00:50:44,980 --> 00:50:45,820
Yeah, what am I, the vending machine?

993
00:50:45,820 --> 00:50:46,660
I sold snacks.

994
00:50:46,660 --> 00:50:48,280
I would sell snacks to the ghost store

995
00:50:48,280 --> 00:50:49,500
that would go by my house.

996
00:50:49,500 --> 00:50:50,460
(laughing)

997
00:50:50,460 --> 00:50:53,340
Yeah, there was a graveyard across the street

998
00:50:53,340 --> 00:50:54,180
from my dad's house.

999
00:50:54,180 --> 00:50:55,000
I was never a seller.

1000
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:55,840
I couldn't--

1001
00:50:55,840 --> 00:50:57,260
We set up, I set up a little plastic table

1002
00:50:57,260 --> 00:50:59,160
and me and my brother, we would sell water bottles,

1003
00:50:59,160 --> 00:51:01,660
Coke products, and snacks from Costco.

1004
00:51:01,660 --> 00:51:03,380
And we made a pretty good amount of money.

1005
00:51:03,380 --> 00:51:04,220
Nice.

1006
00:51:04,220 --> 00:51:05,520
Yeah, I was never patient enough

1007
00:51:05,520 --> 00:51:07,020
and no one wanted to buy things from me.

1008
00:51:07,020 --> 00:51:09,220
I loved doing, I just loved having a job.

1009
00:51:09,220 --> 00:51:10,060
Yeah.

1010
00:51:10,060 --> 00:51:10,900
Top comment.

1011
00:51:10,900 --> 00:51:12,860
- As a kid I was obsessed with having a job.

1012
00:51:12,860 --> 00:51:14,740
- I was obsessed with getting things for free.

1013
00:51:14,740 --> 00:51:15,580
- I wanted to, I watched--

1014
00:51:15,580 --> 00:51:17,300
- I was obsessed with being friends with the kid

1015
00:51:17,300 --> 00:51:20,260
who was selling things and then working for him

1016
00:51:20,260 --> 00:51:22,300
and then him being like, yeah, you can get some gum.

1017
00:51:22,300 --> 00:51:27,300
- I had a, I wanted to, I saw my big fat Greek wedding

1018
00:51:27,300 --> 00:51:30,940
and I was like, I asked my parents,

1019
00:51:30,940 --> 00:51:32,940
I was like, we have to open a diner

1020
00:51:32,940 --> 00:51:36,260
because I wanna be like a kid who works at a diner so bad.

1021
00:51:36,260 --> 00:51:37,460
- You wanna be a diner monkey?

1022
00:51:37,460 --> 00:51:38,860
- Yeah, I wanted to be a diner monkey.

1023
00:51:38,860 --> 00:51:41,420
- I tried to work at, my mom did work for,

1024
00:51:41,420 --> 00:51:43,380
before she worked at the super walk,

1025
00:51:43,380 --> 00:51:46,340
she worked at, fuck, I should stop saying the business name.

1026
00:51:46,340 --> 00:51:47,980
She worked at a Greek diner.

1027
00:51:47,980 --> 00:51:49,340
- Yeah.

1028
00:51:49,340 --> 00:51:53,020
- And I worked there for a day, got paid 60 bucks.

1029
00:51:53,020 --> 00:51:53,860
- Whoa.

1030
00:51:53,860 --> 00:51:55,700
- And then I went and bought a PS2.

1031
00:51:55,700 --> 00:51:57,140
- With 60 bucks?

1032
00:51:57,140 --> 00:51:58,380
What year was this?

1033
00:51:58,380 --> 00:51:59,780
- 2010.

1034
00:51:59,780 --> 00:52:00,620
- Oh, okay.

1035
00:52:00,620 --> 00:52:05,140
- And then I asked if I could work there again,

1036
00:52:05,140 --> 00:52:08,220
and then my mom said, "No, they don't want you there."

1037
00:52:08,220 --> 00:52:09,660
(laughing)

1038
00:52:09,660 --> 00:52:12,260
- Dude, I worked in food service for four days

1039
00:52:12,260 --> 00:52:14,860
and I sucked at it so badly.

1040
00:52:14,860 --> 00:52:17,780
I worked at Jersey Mike's for four days

1041
00:52:17,780 --> 00:52:22,220
and I got basically fired because my hands were too sweaty

1042
00:52:22,220 --> 00:52:25,020
because I would put on the gloves, like plastic gloves,

1043
00:52:25,020 --> 00:52:26,820
and I would sweat so much through the gloves

1044
00:52:26,820 --> 00:52:28,660
that they would like fall off of me

1045
00:52:28,660 --> 00:52:29,500
while I was making a sandwich.

1046
00:52:29,500 --> 00:52:31,620
- Probably because you were wearing too big gloves.

1047
00:52:31,620 --> 00:52:32,540
- I have no idea.

1048
00:52:32,540 --> 00:52:34,860
But the guy, the boss, I was like,

1049
00:52:34,860 --> 00:52:37,140
I was like, I'm, yeah, Mike.

1050
00:52:37,140 --> 00:52:39,280
I was like, I'm sweating too much,

1051
00:52:39,280 --> 00:52:41,520
like my gloves keep falling off

1052
00:52:41,520 --> 00:52:43,420
and I can't do anything with these gloves on.

1053
00:52:43,420 --> 00:52:45,560
He's like, okay, well we'll just put some yeast

1054
00:52:45,560 --> 00:52:49,040
and flour on your hands and it'll just dry 'em out.

1055
00:52:49,040 --> 00:52:50,800
And then I did that and I was so sweaty

1056
00:52:50,800 --> 00:52:54,160
that it made like a dough in my gloves.

1057
00:52:54,160 --> 00:52:56,000
And he was like, you can't work here.

1058
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:56,840
- Damn.

1059
00:52:56,840 --> 00:52:59,800
- At LA, at the company me and Alex were interning at.

1060
00:52:59,800 --> 00:53:01,240
- Yeah, you said.

1061
00:53:01,240 --> 00:53:02,680
- I can say it, yeah, I guess.

1062
00:53:02,680 --> 00:53:05,440
Or no, I would say it on a, I'm not gonna say it.

00:53:05,440 --> 00:53:07,040

1087
00:54:15,880 --> 00:54:17,680

I was told only seniors are allowed to sell that only some kids can sell snacks or seniors

1097
00:54:55,600 --> 00:55:02,880
jerking off every day to this is the best thing I've ever experienced. I like porn

1098
00:55:02,880 --> 00:55:06,440
because I jerk off until the end of the video and I faint when the girls say ooh

1099
00:55:06,440 --> 00:55:14,560
yes daddy and I die by the happiness of jerking off. If your school has security

1100
00:55:14,560 --> 00:55:18,760
cameras you're probably gonna get caught doing this. I jacked off at school. You

1101
00:55:18,760 --> 00:55:23,560
jacked off? You fucking freak. In middle school? Yeah dude. If I was bored in class you just go to

1102
00:55:23,560 --> 00:55:27,840
the bathroom crank one out, shoot it in the toilet, leave it there for the janitor to eat.

1103
00:55:27,840 --> 00:55:31,120
That's disgusting. It's normal. No, it's gross. It's a normal healthy thing.

1104
00:55:31,120 --> 00:55:35,000
It's funny that I'm so, I'm not like a horny person now. When I was a kid I

1105
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:40,260
was like the horniest little... I was, it was awesome. That's gross though, I would

1106
00:55:40,260 --> 00:55:44,160
never... It was a peak of my powers man. Jack off at school? That's disgusting. I jack

1107
00:55:44,160 --> 00:55:50,520

1108
00:55:50,520 --> 00:55:57,240
I show them I show them my Ralph's loyalty card as if it's an ID and then I just walk to the bathroom I jerk off

1109
00:55:57,240 --> 00:55:59,560
Damn feels like home number

1110
00:55:59,560 --> 00:56:04,200
I skip ahead to number 12 because the top comment number 12 is or number 12 is your soul

1111
00:56:04,200 --> 00:56:06,800
It's kind of like funny. You have to sell your soul at school, right?

1112
00:56:06,800 --> 00:56:13,880
That's how common on this is my penis is hard for tamales and I agree with selling my souls to some random kids at school

1113
00:56:13,880 --> 00:56:17,100
Just like my penis is hard for tamales

1114
00:56:17,640 --> 00:56:23,440
Pretty good my junk food that's snacks. Fuck you homework doing homework doing hair

1115
00:56:23,440 --> 00:56:26,640
Hair the comment says I'm bald

1116
00:56:26,640 --> 00:56:34,780
Dude hair we did you know this was just at my school there. Did you guys have Pantene's beautiful links locks for love?

1117
00:56:34,780 --> 00:56:38,120
yeah, yeah, we had that but it was called Pantene's beautiful links and

1118
00:56:38,120 --> 00:56:43,320
Like it was a mandatory thing we had

1119
00:56:43,320 --> 00:56:46,200
Crazy, it was like a pep rally

1120
00:56:46,360 --> 00:56:53,160
That was also a hair cutting ceremony. Mm-hmm, and we had like they shut down Pantene Beautiful Lengths

1121
00:56:53,160 --> 00:56:56,680
But we had the most hair donated by a high school

1122
00:56:56,680 --> 00:57:03,880
Dude, my high school is fucking crazy. Isn't most wig hair taken from like like corpses in India?

1123
00:57:03,880 --> 00:57:08,920
Yeah, it's like by corpses that half most of the hair that we would donate at our school

1124
00:57:08,920 --> 00:57:13,040
They wouldn't use yeah and girls would pressure other girls into doing it

1125
00:57:13,040 --> 00:57:16,240
and then some girls would shave their heads completely bald just to be like

1126
00:57:16,240 --> 00:57:19,840
"look at how much I'm donating" and it was just like a whole freaking freak fest

1127
00:57:19,840 --> 00:57:23,680
of just kids just donating like girls donating their hair and then like the

1128
00:57:23,680 --> 00:57:26,880
occasional like guy would grow out his hair. And here's the thing

1129
00:57:26,880 --> 00:57:30,880
for these people with cancer, being bald is really actually very cool.

1130
00:57:30,880 --> 00:57:33,760
You know and it's normal. Going bald is the most noble thing you can do.

1131
00:57:33,760 --> 00:57:39,360
Exactly, it's heroic to lose your hair. It is. Me and Patrick are in agreement here.

1132
00:57:39,360 --> 00:57:42,320
- No, no. - It's extremely normal.

1133
00:57:42,320 --> 00:57:43,960
- It doesn't matter if it's because of cancer

1134
00:57:43,960 --> 00:57:45,200
or like other stuff.

1135
00:57:45,200 --> 00:57:46,880
- Just genetics, your grandpa's balls.

1136
00:57:46,880 --> 00:57:48,680
- Maybe you have such bad dandruff

1137
00:57:48,680 --> 00:57:51,000
that just your hair falls out in giant clumps

1138
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:54,160
with like some weird plateau of skin underneath it.

1139
00:57:54,160 --> 00:57:56,440
- And then some of your family members

1140
00:57:56,440 --> 00:57:58,400
also have trichotomelia or whatever,

1141
00:57:58,400 --> 00:58:00,160
that hair pulling thing. - Yeah, it's normal, yeah.

1142
00:58:00,160 --> 00:58:01,760
- And you have a hair pulling thing too,

1143
00:58:01,760 --> 00:58:02,960
but you're also going bald,

1144
00:58:02,960 --> 00:58:04,280
so you're getting freaked out about it.

1145
00:58:04,280 --> 00:58:05,920
- Exactly. - That's normal.

1146
00:58:05,920 --> 00:58:07,760
- It's a normal thing. - So donate some of your hair

1147
00:58:07,760 --> 00:58:10,140
to me Pantene beautiful links at my high school.

1148
00:58:10,140 --> 00:58:11,880
- That's as bad, that's as un-American and bad

1149
00:58:11,880 --> 00:58:13,600
as dying in 9/11.

1150
00:58:13,600 --> 00:58:15,680
I don't think you guys are heroes.

Well, yeah, we're stressed out.

00:58:59,400 --> 00:59:00,760
Definitely by the time this comes out,

1181
00:59:00,760 --> 00:59:01,920
stuff is way worse.

1182
00:59:01,920 --> 00:59:02,880
Yeah.

1183

Or it's way better, we don't know.

1185

No, it's definitely worse.

1186
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:10,000
It's not going to be better.

1187
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:12,000
We'll end it on a wholesome note.

1188
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:14,000

That's why I said we should have read half of them.

1213
01:00:41,760 --> 01:00:43,200
