72
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:06,360
- I was sitting, I was listening to the Misfits

73
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:08,600
and then I was just doing like a thing

74
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:10,880
where I was just doing like a Greek guy voice

75
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:13,640
and just responding to everything that they were saying.

76
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:15,200
(laughing)

77
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:17,960
You have something to, what, oh, you killed a baby today?

78
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:19,720
Do not kill the baby.

79
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:20,720
Do not kill the baby.

80
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:21,720
Why you do this?

81
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:22,720
Do not kill the baby.

82
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:23,720
That's Greek?

83
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:24,720
You have something to say?

84
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:25,720
You have something to say?

85
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:26,720
You say something nice.

86
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:27,720
Yeah, this is your Greek guy?

87
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:30,800
This is just an impression of my best friend's dad growing up.

88
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:31,800
That's what he sounded like.

89
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:32,800
Was he Greek?

90
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:33,800
Yeah, he was super Greek.

91
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:36,000
And he talked back to Misfits songs?

92
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,240
No.

93
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:38,240
But now he did.

94
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:39,240
But now he did.

95
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:40,520
Because you did what to my mommy today?

96
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:41,800
You did what to my mother?

97
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:42,800
You do not do this.

98
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:47,360
I remember that day we were just walking around and just making up misfits songs

99
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:50,960
so that's some of the most fun I've ever had just like just oh yeah around

100
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:55,840
central just being like I just saw a spider

101
00:03:55,840 --> 00:04:02,480
the best was like me just singing the the actual part from teenagers from Mars

102
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:06,520
and you were like you thought that was so funny and I was like I just sang an

103
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:14,020
actual song. The gap between like different types of

104
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:18,960
misfits songs are so funny cuz like yeah I have one song that's like you do what

105
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:23,240
to Jackie Kennedy? Do not do this to her. Yeah like they have their songs are

106
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:28,160
about like I just saw a skeleton wrapped in mummy rags and the

107
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:32,120
other half are like I just killed 300 women and had sex with them after they

108
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:36,240
were dead right like there's just no in between at all. It's so funny it's

109
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:40,620
like the difference between like like I guess horrorcore now and horrorcore in

110
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:45,200
the 70s is like yeah yeah exactly like basis for everything was either like

111
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:51,620
psycho or like the wolfman yeah like like we get like Slipknot and shit and we get

112
00:04:51,620 --> 00:04:55,260
like like cool shit like people wearing like leather face masks and then back then

113
00:04:55,260 --> 00:05:01,940
yeah they had to wear like like a fact that it's like I saw an alien

114
00:05:04,660 --> 00:05:05,160
Yeah.

115
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:07,160
This thing about Marvin the Martian.

116
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:09,160
Yeah, and they were like, "These guys are Satanists."

117
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:09,660
Oh my god, this is...

118
00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:10,160
These are...

119
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:11,160
They are terrifying to me.

120
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:12,160
Oh my god.

121
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:12,660
Wow.

122
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:14,160
Last night when I watched...

123
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:16,160
I smoked weed again for the last time...

124
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:17,160
Last night.

125
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:19,160
Or for the first time in a long time.

126
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:20,660
Because I was also not smoking.

127
00:05:20,660 --> 00:05:22,160
And, uh...

128
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:23,660
When I was watching The Usual Suspects,

129
00:05:23,660 --> 00:05:25,160
you know the end where like he...

130
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:29,160
It's revealed he pieced everything together by like looking at the shit on the walls and stuff?

131
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:30,660
No, I've never seen The Usual Suspects.

132
00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:32,160
Oh, so in the movie he like...

133
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:34,160
The main character tells this like whole story.

134
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:38,700
Kevin Spacey tells this whole story and he just makes up details using like the

135
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:45,440
names on the on the like wall behind the detective and like the random shit on

136
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:49,540
the wall behind the detective like the towns and stuff and I was just imagining

137
00:05:49,540 --> 00:05:54,300
Kevin Spacey and Bryan Singer coming up with that scene in Bryan Singer's office

138
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:57,800
and Kevin Spacey's like yeah here let me show you this it would be something like

139
00:05:57,800 --> 00:06:02,320
this yeah I used to know this guy down in Poughkeepsie his name was seven year

140
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:08,620

Jana had never seen the movie before and I'm just spoiling it yeah that's the

143
00:06:20,020 --> 00:06:26,220
best just ruining a movie sucks dude the usual suspects it's oh yeah sucks when I

144
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:30,580
I didn't even like it ever I didn't even like it in high school I was like

145
00:06:30,580 --> 00:06:34,780
annoying about that movie like it was like I I was it was maybe like the first

146
00:06:34,780 --> 00:06:39,340
movie I got into and I just got into like bad shitty movies and that was my

147
00:06:39,340 --> 00:06:43,540
favorite one and I would I would show it to people and I would do that I would be

148
00:06:43,540 --> 00:06:49,000
like you're gonna love the twist ending this movie but it sucks dude none of the

149
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:54,000
dialogue makes any sense yeah fucking Gabriel Byrne is just doing an Irish

150
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:59,140
accent the entire time and he's supposed to be like a New York cop it's fucking

151
00:06:59,140 --> 00:07:03,940
terrible dude and also there's two pedophiles that made the movie.

152
00:07:03,940 --> 00:07:09,460
The movie I got annoying about like that was train spotting I think.

153
00:07:09,460 --> 00:07:14,780
Yeah. If you watch train spotting now do you like it? Yeah I think it holds up.

154
00:07:14,780 --> 00:07:19,660
Yeah. I've not seen train spotting 2 because I don't want to. My movie was fight club.

155
00:07:19,660 --> 00:07:24,780
That was fight club for me. Oh yeah. I was really into fight club. I would say those are all kind of in the

156
00:07:24,780 --> 00:07:31,180
same I watch I got really yeah I got train spotting and then in middle school

157

161
00:07:48,940 --> 00:07:51,780
it is the most insane thing I've ever seen I watched it for the first time when

162
00:07:51,780 --> 00:07:54,700
we were doing when we started the gun city noir campaign.

163
00:07:54,700 --> 00:07:56,500
Yeah, watch it right now.

00:08:03,940 --> 00:08:04,940
Yeah.

168
00:08:04,940 --> 00:08:08,940
Dude, it's just like, it just looks, like it looks so awful.

169
00:08:08,940 --> 00:08:12,260
Just like all the bizarre like CGI, like color grading.

170
00:08:12,260 --> 00:08:14,420
It makes like literally no sense at all.

171
00:08:14,420 --> 00:08:18,740
There's a scene where that's supposed to be like cool, where the big guy with the like

172
00:08:18,740 --> 00:08:19,740
square jaw.

173
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:20,740

Serial killer with anime like like shiny glasses. Yeah, dude. I forgot Elijah wood was in that movie

178
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:46,920
Elijah wood for a while. He was trying to be just a real a regular actor

179
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:52,680
I mean, he's a horror guy, which is very funny. He produced like Mandy and all that shit. He's like a horror producer

180
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:56,520
I didn't know that. Yeah, it's like to be like one of like him or

181
00:08:56,520 --> 00:09:00,120
Harry Potter who are the exact same guy in my brain?

182
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:05,200
But yeah, one you play you play a kid once and now everybody's like, yeah, you're yeah

183
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:08,960
It wasn't even a kid

184
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:12,000
Yeah, that's true, yeah

185
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:19,120
No, but yeah, he was he made the maniac remake he was in that too. He produced he's on Spectre vision is his production company

186
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:21,120
They do a bunch of like

187
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:23,200
Pretty creepy. I remember

188
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:27,560
How much he does that he will never ever escape

189
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:32,920
Right in Frodo. Yeah, right kind of sucks. Kind of the ultimate horror. Yeah

190
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:35,840
He should make a movie about that. Yeah

191
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:40,320
Yeah being a guy who it was in a fantasy movie and then trying to do Wilfred

192
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:44,980
Yeah, and then oh yeah, Wilfred dude Wilfred was funny

193
00:09:44,980 --> 00:09:50,160
I I watched the um on what is funny cuz it's funny to hear like an Australian guy

194
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:53,560
Like a dog yeah beat no just say curse words

195
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:56,320
Yeah, I'm sniffing your butt and I can't eat chocolate

196
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:59,760
Yeah, it's funny an Australian dog

197
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:05,380
They should I watch the original on ISE thought the idea of an Australian dog is funnier than the show

198
00:10:05,380 --> 00:10:08,320
Yeah, just think you're about an Australian dog

199
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:14,520
Yeah, it's like sniffing bones and and burying stuff and having an Australian accent makes me laugh

200
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:19,020
It's crazy how like every Australian show that gets adapted to like America

201
00:10:19,020 --> 00:10:23,440
American audiences just like does better than the the slap

202
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:26,280
Review

203
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:32,680
The first season of review is like one of the best best TV shows. I think yeah, it's really really good

204
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:36,880
Again, probably is funnier in an Australian accent though. Oh, yeah

205
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:41,400
I tried to I tried to watch it and I don't remember it because I had both of

206
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:45,920
them on Hulu at the same time yeah in like 2015 uh-huh I'll have to rewatch it

207
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:49,640
I'm sure some Australian guys gonna be like oh you're gonna fucking love it I

208
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:54,580
don't think we have an Australian fan somebody keeps telling us to come to

209
00:10:54,580 --> 00:11:03,800
Australia we definitely have Australian people at our size I know and it's a

210
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:08,120
I mean it's a huge country. We would do a show in Perth or whatever and the three

211
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:11,240
people that listen to the podcast in Australia would not be able to make it.

212
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:17,200
Right. I don't even know who these fucking guys are. Australian people

213
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:21,400
love internet irony. That's their thing. That's true. They all walk around

214
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:25,440
they call each other cunt all the time. True. They love bad words and stuff. That's

215
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:29,920
true. That's true. Cunt is just like my best friend in Australia. I've never heard

I'm United States of America.

229
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:31,680
Cameron is a scientist, because he's from Cambridge.

I'm my house son.

231
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:36,920
I am.

232
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:37,920
It's true.

233
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:38,920
I'm a guy.

234
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:40,840
I'm a guy with no job.

235
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:42,280
I'm the guy, Elijah Wood.

236
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:44,600
I'm the guy Elijah Wood, Spy Kids 3.

237
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:45,600
God, dude.

238
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,160
See, he played a kid in that.

239
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:48,160
No, he played the guy.

240
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:49,240
No, he played a guy.

241
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:50,440
He played the guy.

242
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:53,720
I've never been so quickly and swiftly owned.

243
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:55,160
Oh my god dude.

244
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:56,160
I'm so dumb.

245
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:59,040
I didn't even think about the guy.

246
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:01,720
I didn't even think about the guy part.

247
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:03,960
I didn't know adults were allowed in that thing.

248
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:08,040
Except for the grandpa, who I love in that movie.

249
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:10,120
Ricardo Multoban, Khan.

250
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:12,760
The best part of that movie is when he learns how to walk.

251
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:16,800
And he's like, "I can walk, I can run."

252
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:21,100
And then they're like, "Grandpa, we need you to help save my sister."

253
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:24,860
And then he just runs away on the moon.

254
00:13:24,860 --> 00:13:27,920
He's like, "I don't care."

255
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:31,840
I love Spy Kids, but I fucking hated Sharkboy and Lava Girl.

256
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:36,280
Wait, my favorite part of the guy from Spy Kids 3 is if you go-

257
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:37,280
Is his penis.

258
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:38,280
Yeah.

259
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:39,280
Let's go!

260
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:40,280
Woo!

261
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:45,760
If you go to the Spy Kids wiki and look up the guy, there's a section that says quotes,

262
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:50,720
And it's "I'm the guy, the guy when he introduces himself" and "Cake, the guy right before his

263
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:51,720
death."

264
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:55,400
Yeah, he really only had two lines in that movie.

265
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:57,640
Well, he also says "Nothing is unwinnable.

266
00:13:57,640 --> 00:14:01,760
The guy, 40 seconds before he succumbs to the unwinnable level."

267
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:03,320
Those are his three quotes.

268
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:06,920
Yeah, nothing's unwinnable except for the game which you two just lost.

269
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:09,000
Oh my god.

270
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,560
Come on, dude.

271
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:11,560
Come on.

272
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:12,560
Don't fuck with me.

273
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:14,320
I'm fucking on a roll today.

274
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:15,320
I'm a train.

275
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:18,440
I saw Spy Kids 3D at Chunkies.

276
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:19,280
Oh yeah, dude.

277
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:21,920
Is that your own body?

278
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:24,600
I only went to Chunkies one time.

279
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:25,880
Chunkies was so cool.

280
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:26,920
What is Chunkies?

281
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:28,640
Chunkies is a movie theater

282
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:30,840
that's also a restaurant in New Hampshire

283
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:32,520
and in the greater like--

284
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:34,240
Every movie theater is a restaurant.

285
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:36,080
Popcorn, pretzels, Slurpee.

286
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:38,760
No, they serve you food, you have like a menu and stuff.

287
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:40,200
You get a menu and you have a waiter

288
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:41,640
and he interrupts the movie.

289
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:42,640
There's not a menu.

290
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:44,040
The waiter interrupts your movie

291
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:47,920
and he asks, he goes, "What can I get for you?"

292
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:50,040
- That's the worst job in America.

293
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:51,440
- We only carry Pepsi products.

294
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:54,320
- That is more dangerous than Alaskan crab fisher.

295
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:55,520
- Yeah. (laughs)

296
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:57,200
- That is fucking horrible, dude.

297
00:14:57,200 --> 00:15:01,240
- Dude, it's a great place if you're like eight years old,

298
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:05,000
but if you go to Chunky's when you're like 18

299
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,480
and you're seeing the Deadpool movie

300
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:08,560
and you get way too high on a Monday

301
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:11,360
and you see the Deadpool movie at noon

302
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:14,040
and it's other guys your age and older

303
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:18,440
who also have the day off eating chicken nuggets.

304
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:22,000
- There was a place in my hometown called Cinema Grill,

305
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,840
which was similar, it was like a,

306
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:26,440
just a movie theater restaurant.

307
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:30,440
And my dad loved, it wasn't even upscale,

308
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:31,640
like it was like chicken fingers.

309
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:33,720
Like my dad loved the chicken fingers

310
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:36,240
and we would go every couple weeks.

311
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:39,220
And it closed down and I guess my dad didn't know

312
00:15:39,220 --> 00:15:45,940
because we like tried to go one day to watch some fucking movie in 2006 and we

313
00:15:45,940 --> 00:15:49,140
pulled up and it was like closed for business they had like a sign in the

314
00:15:49,140 --> 00:15:53,740
door and my dad I just remember him going like

315
00:15:53,740 --> 00:16:04,700
cuz he loved the chicken tenders damn this they were his fucking favorite did

316
00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:08,860
movie theaters that serve food is the stupidest fucking thing just eat food

317
00:16:08,860 --> 00:16:12,780
before you go to the movie theater yeah right well then you get there if you

318
00:16:12,780 --> 00:16:17,500
wanna if you want to eat a meal in a like in a movie theater I think you're a

319
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:22,260
psycho I don't want anything to do with you I I don't know I mean popcorn maybe

320
00:16:22,260 --> 00:16:26,740
and like you know yeah I said a meal this conversation would divide between

321
00:16:26,740 --> 00:16:32,260
me and Cameron versus Patrick. Who would have ever thought that?

322
00:16:32,260 --> 00:16:38,620
Differing opinions here. I'm gonna I'm yeah it's disruptive to the movie and I

323
00:16:38,620 --> 00:16:42,660
I don't have a table and I don't and it's fucking it's loud

324
00:16:42,660 --> 00:16:46,700
It's a lot of smelling smells up the place with all the food smell, you know

325
00:16:46,700 --> 00:16:52,100
And it's and that would be why if it was all like it was all like katsu curry and like yeah

326
00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:59,620
Fried rice and shit. Yeah, just a tonka. It's like so expensive to just eat at home or like eat somewhere else first

327
00:16:59,620 --> 00:17:08,220
No, it's not ever nice it's nice you you like to watch art house horror movies, I don't like

328
00:17:08,220 --> 00:17:09,060
- I like to watch house bar movies.

329
00:17:09,060 --> 00:17:10,100
- And eat dust.

330
00:17:10,100 --> 00:17:13,180
You sit there, you eat lint and little things

331
00:17:13,180 --> 00:17:14,020
out of your pocket while you watch wax.

332
00:17:14,020 --> 00:17:15,700
- I'll get popcorn sometimes at the movie theater,

333
00:17:15,700 --> 00:17:17,980
but I won't get anything else.

334
00:17:17,980 --> 00:17:19,180
- You don't even like going to the movie,

335
00:17:19,180 --> 00:17:20,020

00:17:20,020 --> 00:17:21,420
- I don't like going to the movie theater.

337
00:17:21,420 --> 00:17:23,140

00:17:23,140 --> 00:17:24,460
- Watching movies in my cube.

339
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:26,060

342
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:33,580
to getting really, really high

343
00:17:33,580 --> 00:17:35,020
and then just sitting in your bedroom

344
00:17:35,020 --> 00:17:37,700
and watching a movie and getting too scared in the middle

345
00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:39,540
and then falling asleep.

346
00:17:39,540 --> 00:17:42,000

you can't have sex with the movie correctly

353
00:17:51,420 --> 00:17:53,340

379
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:27,800
I know that none of us ever had a fleshlight did you ever have a friend

380
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:35,400
you at a flashlight? No, but I knew one of my little brother's friends was...

381
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:40,040
He had like a party at my parents house and he was like...

382
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:44,200
Fleshlight party? Yeah, fleshlight party. Or no no no, yeah he was just telling us about how he...

383
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:46,200
Pass it to the left!

384
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:48,200
[Laughter]

385
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:50,200
[Laughter]

386
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:54,200
He was telling us about how he knows how to make a homemade fleshlight.

387
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:56,200
A homemade fleshlight?

388
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:57,200
That's a vagina.

389
00:19:57,200 --> 00:20:01,800
With like a toilet paper tube and a rubber glove.

390
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:04,000
Yeah, I got an idea for a homemade fleshlight.

391
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:09,900
You put a pie in the toilet.

392
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:14,040
My only person I ever knew who had a fleshlight besides my friend's dad, which I think I've

393
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:19,420
definitely told that before on the podcast, where my friend, she like showed it to me

394
00:20:19,420 --> 00:20:22,420
in like her dad's closet.

395
00:20:22,420 --> 00:20:25,280
She was like, "Look at this shit."

396
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:28,560
And then her dad walked in right then, and he's a pastor.

397
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:31,560
He's a pastor and he's like, "What are you guys doing?"

398
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:34,240
And she was like, "We're looking for a flashlight."

399
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:39,480
And then she got like chewed out for an hour, and then he came and sat next to me on the

400
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:40,920
couch and cried to me.

401
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:43,400
And he was like, "I'm so sorry you had to see that."

402
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:47,400
I was like, "I don't fucking care, man.

403
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:48,400
Fuck whatever you want."

404
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:52,120
Hey man, hey man, as long as you give me a turn, I don't give a shit.

405
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:54,600
As long as you're happy.

406
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:59,240
No, the only person besides that that I knew out of fleshlight was my cousin who is now

407
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:01,800
in jail for peeping Tom.

408
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:05,760
Did you just spit out water?

409
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:11,160
No, I was taking a jewel hit while he fucking said that.

410
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:12,160
Yeah, dude.

411
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:13,160
In jail for peeping Tom.

412
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:14,600
He might be out of jail now.

413
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:15,600
I don't know.

414
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:16,600
Obviously, I haven't seen him.

415
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:18,760
He's gonna come peep on you now that you said that.

416
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:19,760
His name's Chris.

417
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:21,320
He's peeping on you right now.

418
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:25,320
They should call it peeping whatever the person's name was when they get arrested.

419
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:29,320
His name's Chris and he sounds so much like Kermit the Frog that when...

420
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:30,320
Peeping Chris, Peeping Kevin.

421
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:35,320
Sounds so much like Kermit the Frog that everybody in high school called him Kermit the Frog.

422
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:42,320
And then he took it on as like a cool white boy rapper moniker and went by Crispy Kermit.

423
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:44,320
Crispy Kermit!

424
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:48,320
Crispy Kermit!

425
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:50,320
Crispy Kerm

426
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:58,880
Just I'm imagining just a rapper named Kermit who raps about instead of like shooting people he raps about spying on girls a

427
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:03,180
Crispy Kermit is what you call it when you forget to clean your flashlight

428
00:22:03,180 --> 00:22:13,480
Yeah, dude shout out to Chris he's the fucking man I think he was diagnosed with autism late in life, okay

429
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:19,640
Crispy Kerm dude, that's such a good fucking name.

430
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:20,640
Peeping Kermit?

431
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:24,640
*laughter*

432
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:26,640
He's just looking for his Miss Piggy dude.

433
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:27,640
Yeah.

434
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:28,640
Anyway, he walks.

435
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:30,640
Hey, I need to, I need to...

436
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:33,640
Ma'am, can I just look through your window for a little bit?

437
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:35,640
Ma'am, leave your, leave your window open a night.

438
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:37,640
Ma'am, seri- please? Can I, can I look through?

439
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:41,640
I think he actually, I think it was like more, I think he, I think it was a panty raid, like Spongebob style.

440
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:43,640
Oh, he did a panty raid?

441
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:48,760
I think he did a panty raid. I think he like got into a girl's house and stole her clothes. Oh, that's worse

442
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:55,480
Do you guys have any flashlights of pigs

443
00:22:55,480 --> 00:23:00,240
Yeah, I just want I just want a flesh like that

00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:09,240

Suck his dick dude Kermit would never fuck front for a free Frozy get over here and let me suck your dick

447
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:26,140
But did he

448
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:42,560
Would you guys ever have that done? Would you ever have your penis modeled? If like we could probably I feel like we could sell two

449
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:43,640
of those

450
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:50,480
You know you still does you could sell them not any of us. Everybody would be pretty disappointed in my penis, dude

451
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:57,680
Yeah, yeah, just like it goes it people have like a left hook or right hook mine goes down like Snape's nose. I

452
00:23:57,680 --> 00:24:05,320
Swear to God dude, it's like I've been having it's like I've been like training with an anvil on my

453
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:09,320
It slopes down.

454
00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:11,760
It's trying to drag you to hell, dude.

455
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:12,760
It is.

456
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:14,320
It really is, man.

457
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:20,500
It's just looking for water.

458
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:22,740
It's evolution, dude.

459
00:24:22,740 --> 00:24:28,000
My dad's penis couldn't reach and my penis just got a little closer to all the bugs on

460
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:31,400
the ground that it wants to eat up.

461
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:33,720
All the ants.

462
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:35,720
Just suck them up like a vacuum cleaner?

463
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:37,720
You suck them up like an anteater, man.

464
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:39,000
Yeah.

465
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,840
Do anteaters only eat ants?

466
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:42,840
I don't know.

467
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:45,240
You think that gets boring?

468
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:46,240
No.

469
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:48,480
You think they love it every time?

470
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:49,480
Yeah.

471
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:50,480
Yeah?

472
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:52,400
Every single time they're like, "Nice, another ant."

473
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:57,800
Man, I mean, like, think about how excited a dog gets for, like, just, like, shitty cereal

474
00:24:57,800 --> 00:24:58,800
every single day.

475
00:24:58,800 --> 00:24:59,800
Or just shit.

476
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:00,800
Twice a day.

477
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:01,800
Yeah, exactly.

478
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:02,800
That's true.

479
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:04,800
Yeah, animals have no taste.

480
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:05,300
Yeah.

481
00:25:05,300 --> 00:25:06,300
It's true.

482
00:25:06,300 --> 00:25:07,800
We're way cooler than animals.

483
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:08,800
Animals love to eat the trash.

484
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:09,800
I think I'm gonna get a cat.

485
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:10,300
That's true.

486
00:25:10,300 --> 00:25:11,300
Like this week.

487
00:25:11,300 --> 00:25:11,800
Yeah?

488
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:12,300
Yeah.

489
00:25:12,300 --> 00:25:12,800
What kind?

490
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:20,300
Uh, based on the ones that my wife is sending me on Instagram, a very sad, traumatized old cat.

491
00:25:20,300 --> 00:25:21,300
Yeah?

492
00:25:21,300 --> 00:25:22,300
Yeah, 'cause she just sends me every-

493
00:25:22,300 --> 00:25:23,300
That pisses dust?

494
00:25:23,300 --> 00:25:34,300
She sends me every fucking day some picture of a cat with cloudy blue eyes, and it's like, "This one's name is Bobo. Bobo got shot out of a cannon in a Taiwanese circus.

495
00:25:34,300 --> 00:25:35,820
Do you want him in your house?

496
00:25:35,820 --> 00:25:39,340
It's like, no dude, but is he free?

497
00:25:39,340 --> 00:25:41,500
Okay, I guess I'll take him.

498
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:42,320
Who cares?

499
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:43,160
Yeah, exactly.

500
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:47,820
You're gonna experience the feeling

501
00:25:47,820 --> 00:25:49,020
that you get when you own a cat.

502
00:25:49,020 --> 00:25:50,140
You're gonna--

503
00:25:50,140 --> 00:25:51,420
You're gonna experience the feeling

504
00:25:51,420 --> 00:25:52,740
you get when you own a cat, pal.

505
00:25:52,740 --> 00:25:53,900
You're gonna become, I was gonna say--

506
00:25:53,900 --> 00:25:55,100
'Cause you know if you get a cat,

507
00:25:55,100 --> 00:25:55,940
you're gonna experience having a cat, Taylor.

508
00:25:55,940 --> 00:25:57,580
I was gonna say cat dad,

509
00:25:57,580 --> 00:25:59,620
but I didn't wanna sound like a fucking loser.

510
00:25:59,620 --> 00:26:00,460
You are.

511
00:26:00,460 --> 00:26:01,280
You are a cat dad.

512
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:03,220
I mean, just the fact that that's what you were gonna say

513
00:26:03,220 --> 00:26:07,520
kind of confirms it yeah it's honestly even even lamer that you just wouldn't

514
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:13,060
even say it yeah but you that you wanted to fight your instinct to say cat dead I

515
00:26:13,060 --> 00:26:18,940
feel like this is worse than what you would say this is worse than what you

516
00:26:18,940 --> 00:26:21,980
would say if you were actually gonna make fun of me for saying cat dead so I

517
00:26:21,980 --> 00:26:26,740
should I just fucking said it absolutely worse mm-hmm um cuz now you're

518
00:26:26,740 --> 00:26:32,180
analyzing my thoughts yeah yeah I go psychoanalyze yeah when you fucking

519
00:26:32,180 --> 00:26:40,700
analyze me yeah I don't you want to fuck my mother and you're going to believe

520
00:26:40,700 --> 00:26:47,020
you me damn we have a list today which is the top ten silliest ideas for movies

521
00:26:47,020 --> 00:26:52,460
oh we're doing that one first yeah all right I feel like we I feel like we can

522
00:26:52,460 --> 00:26:56,580
one-up these also I think this one's fine yeah we can kind of plot them out

523
00:26:56,580 --> 00:26:59,080
- We can use our beautiful minds.

524
00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:01,920
- We have three beautiful strange minds

525
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:02,760
that we can combine.

526
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:05,680
- Our savant, our Charlie Kaufman minds.

527
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:06,520
- Yeah.

528
00:27:06,520 --> 00:27:08,200
- We can turn these into-- - Well, I'm not a savant.

529
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:09,940
You two are savants.

530
00:27:09,940 --> 00:27:12,000
- I definitely am an idiot savant.

531
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,240
- No, I'm just a genius.

532
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:15,320
I'm not a savant.

533
00:27:15,320 --> 00:27:17,800
- Yeah, no, Cameron's too smart to call himself a savant.

534
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:18,640
- Caleb, you're a suck off.

535
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:20,020
- Cameron is so smart.

536
00:27:20,020 --> 00:27:21,600
- I'm so smart, dude. - You're a suck off.

537
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:22,600
- Dude, I just called you smart,

538
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:24,000
and you called me a suck off?

539
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:24,840
- Yeah.

Why don't we get any fucking geniuses in here?

547
00:27:57,580 --> 00:28:00,900
What does this have to do with what GMC makes?

548
00:28:00,900 --> 00:28:02,860
It's just the way it goes.

549
00:28:02,860 --> 00:28:07,100
You start at the bottom sucking off idiots in the mail room.

550
00:28:07,100 --> 00:28:09,900
And then you get to the top building a Silverado.

551
00:28:09,900 --> 00:28:12,700
Yeah, sucking off idiots in the C-suite.

552
00:28:12,700 --> 00:28:13,700
The GMC Silverado.

553
00:28:13,700 --> 00:28:19,540
Hey, Peterson, if you make one more mistake, we're sending you to the idiot closet and

554
00:28:19,540 --> 00:28:22,540
you don't want to know what happens to you in there.

555
00:28:22,540 --> 00:28:27,340
Alright, we'll tell you, you have to shuck a bunch of people off.

556
00:28:27,340 --> 00:28:30,420
It's exactly what you've been doing.

557
00:28:30,420 --> 00:28:34,940
Number one silliest idea for a movie, the drawing of paint.

558
00:28:34,940 --> 00:28:36,960
That's a good title for a movie.

559
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:38,540
That's like a Yorgos Lanthimos movie.

560
00:28:38,540 --> 00:28:39,540
Yeah, exactly.

561
00:28:39,540 --> 00:28:44,780
Where it would be about a very boring lesbian relationship and nothing would happen.

562
00:28:44,780 --> 00:28:50,220
Well no, it would be about two lesbians who are sisters who gradually cut off different

563
00:28:50,220 --> 00:28:54,140
parts of their bodies every night and then which one is your ghost lanthimos

564
00:28:54,140 --> 00:28:57,020
but it's filmed the film gradually spins around

565
00:28:57,020 --> 00:28:58,380
he's that guy's voice you were doing earlier

566
00:28:58,380 --> 00:29:03,180
oh okay yeah you know he made the lobster and uh oh got it got it and shit he made

567
00:29:03,180 --> 00:29:09,180
the lobster and the mobster i i don't know i've never i i really i've

568
00:29:09,180 --> 00:29:13,020
realized i'm not a movie person like i like watch movies but i don't like

569
00:29:13,020 --> 00:29:16,140
i like the favorite the thing is i watch my favorite

570
00:29:18,380 --> 00:29:21,180
I watched the whole movie and none of my favorite stuff showed up.

571
00:29:21,180 --> 00:29:23,180
[Laughter]

572
00:29:23,180 --> 00:29:24,680
There's no guns in any of his movies.

573
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:27,180
Actually, there is in Killing a Sacred Deer, I think.

574
00:29:27,180 --> 00:29:29,180
Yeah, how are they gonna kill the deer?

575
00:29:29,180 --> 00:29:30,180
That's true.

576
00:29:30,180 --> 00:29:35,880
I think, um, yeah, I'm bad at, like, I don't really even remember any movies that I watch.

577
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:39,880
Like, the only reason I remember anything from Usual Suspects is because I watched it last night

578
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:43,180
and I remember thinking, like, I have to remember this movie.

579
00:29:43,180 --> 00:29:45,880
'Cause every movie, I just have, like, the worst memory.

580
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:46,880
Yeah.

581
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:47,880
Yeah, me too.

582
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:52,520
The only reason I watch a bunch of movies is to like

583
00:29:52,520 --> 00:30:00,300
Quell my my like list and ranking autism is so if I watch movies, I don't have to make spreadsheets all day

584
00:30:00,300 --> 00:30:06,420
That's the same part of my brain to just be able to mark like have seen this movie like check it off on a list

585
00:30:06,420 --> 00:30:12,200
Well, you do you do reviews - I don't yeah, that's just to keep track of it though. Yeah

586
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:15,240
the drawing of paint

587
00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:20,840
Well, I mean it's safe to say it's not a good movie. Yeah drying of paint. It's got like

588
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:28,540
Fucking it's got some like big-name actor and then some actor who was on like a British TV show for a long time

589
00:30:28,540 --> 00:30:31,920
And now they're finally like this is trying to do an American accent. Yeah

590
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:37,040
Being like they way I need I need your help help

591
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:44,160
Opening my car. I think he has the worst American accent. Yeah, you doctor strange the whole time

592
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:46,160
"Give me a cheeseburger, please."

593
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:48,160
There's no like, there's no...

594
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:50,160
"I'll take a cheeseburger at McDonald's."

595
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:52,160
He's not doing like, there's no...

596
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:54,160
It's not like where they pick

597
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:56,160
like a state to base their accent

598
00:30:56,160 --> 00:30:58,160
off of. It's like he listened to...

599
00:30:58,160 --> 00:31:00,160
It sounds like an Indian guy making fun of how Americans

600
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:02,160
talk. Yeah. Like doing like a

601
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:04,160
comedian impression.

602
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:06,160
It sounds like he listened to Microsoft,

603
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:08,160
Sam, and then was just like, "Well,

604
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:10,160
that's, yeah, that's American." "I'm

605
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:12,160
Mr. Strange." "Ah, I'm a

606
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:18,880
football I'm the doctor who is strange and you need to help me get the portal

607
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:27,760
open I need a I need two portals I'm thinking of doing magic I'm doing math

608
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:34,420

609
00:31:34,420 --> 00:31:37,800
Marvel movie so he's also just doing like so that's a thing that just

610
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:46,620
happened yeah wow yeah that didn't open Wow hmm he rocks dude number two is

611
00:31:46,620 --> 00:31:51,620
already a movie it's the cobbler Chandler yeah that's true Patrick's

612
00:31:51,620 --> 00:31:55,100
favorite thing to do on this podcast is to say his riff before reading what the

613
00:31:55,100 --> 00:31:59,900
list item is so it makes no sense to anyone who's listening what do you mean

614
00:31:59,900 --> 00:32:04,460
it's what you just do that all the time you say this next one is just like and

615
00:32:04,460 --> 00:32:06,460
then say something but don't actually say what it is.

616
00:32:06,460 --> 00:32:08,460
Nobody knows what you're talking about.

617
00:32:08,460 --> 00:32:10,460
Number two is the shoe shop.

618
00:32:10,460 --> 00:32:12,460
Yeah, the shoe shop. That's the cobbler with Adam Sandler.

619
00:32:12,460 --> 00:32:14,460
See, that's the order

620
00:32:14,460 --> 00:32:16,460
you're supposed to say the things in.

621
00:32:16,460 --> 00:32:18,460
Alright, well I'm still, I'm growing, I'm learning.

622
00:32:18,460 --> 00:32:20,460
I'm gonna... Every day you're getting worse

623
00:32:20,460 --> 00:32:22,460
and worse, is the truth.

624
00:32:22,460 --> 00:32:24,460
It is so funny to me that this pod, like, we're like

625
00:32:24,460 --> 00:32:26,460
over a hundred episodes in and this is just,

626
00:32:26,460 --> 00:32:28,460
like, the podcast is just like a

627
00:32:28,460 --> 00:32:30,460
very gradual process of just like

628
00:32:30,460 --> 00:32:32,460
gradually changing all the stupid things

629
00:32:32,460 --> 00:32:39,300
we do into like some very slightly less stupid like ways to talk yeah like it's

630
00:32:39,300 --> 00:32:43,020
getting better man yeah just like gradually you know like like learning

631
00:32:43,020 --> 00:32:48,700
not to talk over each other yeah turd like which we still do so yeah we used

632
00:32:48,700 --> 00:32:53,580
to that's true yeah those you were slaying first 30 episodes the evil the

633
00:32:53,580 --> 00:32:58,220
dark 31 it's just the dark 31 it's just it's just three audio tracks and that

634
00:32:58,220 --> 00:32:59,060
- That was before I was here.

635
00:32:59,060 --> 00:32:59,900
- That was before I was here.

636
00:32:59,900 --> 00:33:00,720
- At the same time, yeah.

637
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:02,140
- That was before I was here.

638
00:33:02,140 --> 00:33:04,960
That got way worse as soon as I joined.

639
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:07,340
- I think after our Seeking Derangements episode,

640
00:33:07,340 --> 00:33:10,580
Pat is either gonna get more or less like Jacques

641
00:33:10,580 --> 00:33:12,340
from Seeking Derangements.

642
00:33:12,340 --> 00:33:15,720
He's either learning, or he's learning either poorly

643
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:17,460
or very well from that.

644
00:33:17,460 --> 00:33:18,780
- Yeah.

645
00:33:18,780 --> 00:33:20,020
- Go listen to that, by the way.

646
00:33:20,020 --> 00:33:20,860
- Yeah, you guys should go listen.

647
00:33:20,860 --> 00:33:21,680
- Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

648
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:22,520
I was gonna plug it at the end.

649
00:33:22,520 --> 00:33:24,140
- Listen to Seeking Derangements in general.

650
00:33:24,140 --> 00:33:25,040
- They're so funny.

651
00:33:26,020 --> 00:33:31,020
The shoe shop is a, I think that'd be a good idea for a movie.

652
00:33:31,020 --> 00:33:31,840
- Yeah, it's the cobbler.

653
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:33,540
- Well, here's the description of the,

654
00:33:33,540 --> 00:33:34,740
here's the description of the movie

655
00:33:34,740 --> 00:33:36,780
by the creator of the list, okay?

656
00:33:36,780 --> 00:33:39,060
This is the plot of The Shoe Shop.

657
00:33:39,060 --> 00:33:41,300
A man goes to buy new shoes and goes on

658
00:33:41,300 --> 00:33:43,620
a not so thrilling journey through the city.

659
00:33:43,620 --> 00:33:45,620
Once he is there, he must battle swarms

660
00:33:45,620 --> 00:33:48,100
of annoying little children to get to the shop assistant

661
00:33:48,100 --> 00:33:49,620
and find the perfect shoe.

662
00:33:49,620 --> 00:33:51,640
But wait, something terrible has happened.

663
00:33:51,640 --> 00:33:53,180
The man has no money.

664
00:33:53,180 --> 00:33:55,140
He quests back to his house, finds the money,

665
00:33:55,140 --> 00:33:57,100
and gets back at the shop in time for lunch.

666
00:33:57,100 --> 00:33:59,340
The happy ending is where the man walks out of the shop

667
00:33:59,340 --> 00:34:01,380
with a nice new pair of shoes.

668
00:34:01,380 --> 00:34:02,220
- Okay.

669
00:34:02,220 --> 00:34:03,040
- Whoa.

670
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:04,680
- I thought it was gonna be like a shoe version

671
00:34:04,680 --> 00:34:06,740
of Be Kind Rewind.

672
00:34:06,740 --> 00:34:07,580
- Yeah.

673
00:34:07,580 --> 00:34:08,420
- You know?

674
00:34:08,420 --> 00:34:10,260
- I like that they had to recreate a Jordan one.

675
00:34:10,260 --> 00:34:12,180
- They have to recreate all the different shoes.

676
00:34:12,180 --> 00:34:13,020
- And this guy--

677
00:34:13,020 --> 00:34:16,060
- A magnet came through and took off all the shoes.

678
00:34:16,060 --> 00:34:17,920
None of the shoes work anymore.

679
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:20,860
You can't walk in these.

680
00:34:20,860 --> 00:34:22,780
Oh crap, I can't even move.

681
00:34:22,780 --> 00:34:24,900
- And they just, they rent out pieces of paper

682
00:34:24,900 --> 00:34:26,820
with shoes drawn on them to people.

683
00:34:26,820 --> 00:34:28,660
- Yeah, they rent them out.

684
00:34:28,660 --> 00:34:29,500
- Yeah.

685
00:34:29,500 --> 00:34:30,320
- You should be able to rent,

686
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:31,420
you probably can rent shoes, huh?

687
00:34:31,420 --> 00:34:32,260
- Absolutely.

688
00:34:32,260 --> 00:34:33,420
I like that in this plot-- - But every shoe shop

689
00:34:33,420 --> 00:34:34,260
should have that option.

690
00:34:34,260 --> 00:34:36,740
- The creator of this list assumes

691
00:34:36,740 --> 00:34:39,840
that the shoe shop is filled with children.

692
00:34:39,840 --> 00:34:42,420
Like that's the kind of people who go to a shoe shop,

693
00:34:42,420 --> 00:34:44,180
is annoying little children.

694
00:34:44,180 --> 00:34:45,020
- That's true.

695
00:34:45,020 --> 00:34:47,060
I used to love going to a shoe shop when I was a kid,

696
00:34:47,060 --> 00:34:49,500
trying on some like, just the biggest shoes they have.

697
00:34:49,500 --> 00:34:50,340
- Getting audios.

698
00:34:50,340 --> 00:34:53,680
- Give me a size, could you have a size 17 in these?

699
00:34:53,680 --> 00:34:54,780
And then just walking around.

700
00:34:54,780 --> 00:34:58,220
That's the best go in a Burlington Cove factory and finding the size 22 shoes.

701
00:34:58,220 --> 00:35:01,660
Yeah and then just walking around with big clown shoes.

702
00:35:01,660 --> 00:35:02,660
Yeah.

703
00:35:02,660 --> 00:35:04,220
Slapping them hard on the linoleum floor.

704
00:35:04,220 --> 00:35:08,300
Or like the like the ruby red like Rock-A-Wear loafers.

705
00:35:08,300 --> 00:35:13,540
One thing I don't like about Foot Locker is like you go there and the people who work

706
00:35:13,540 --> 00:35:14,540
there try to like.

707
00:35:14,540 --> 00:35:16,500
They're wearing referee uniforms.

708
00:35:16,500 --> 00:35:21,900
Well that's they try to like cool guy you and be think like make you kind of like judge

709
00:35:21,900 --> 00:35:27,580
you for your shoe picks and then they're dressed like referees the whole time.

710
00:35:27,580 --> 00:35:31,940
Well they're they're mediating your shoe decision. That's true yeah. Yeah they blow

711
00:35:31,940 --> 00:35:35,220
the whistle if you try to buy a shoe they don't like. They give you a red card if you buy the

712
00:35:35,220 --> 00:35:38,660
wrong shoe. Yeah. And then you have to go to timeout and then when you come out

713
00:35:38,660 --> 00:35:43,380
you're actually just playing soccer. Mm-hmm yeah. There's a comment on...

714
00:35:43,380 --> 00:35:47,220
There's a secret soccer game in the back of a footlocker and you're invited.

715
00:35:47,220 --> 00:35:48,220
This is the movie.

716
00:35:48,220 --> 00:35:49,220
This is the movie.

717
00:35:49,220 --> 00:35:50,220
So this is interesting.

718
00:35:50,220 --> 00:35:55,220
A comment on this from dislike my comment says, "I'd love to see a sequel as this is

719
00:35:55,220 --> 00:35:57,220
my favorite movie from 2015."

720
00:35:57,220 --> 00:36:00,220
Isn't that the Cobbler come out in 2015?

721
00:36:00,220 --> 00:36:01,220
I don't know.

722
00:36:01,220 --> 00:36:04,220
What is your obsession with this guy, Adam Sandler?

723
00:36:04,220 --> 00:36:05,220
No, the Cobbler is from 2014.

724
00:36:05,220 --> 00:36:06,220
I just looked it up.

725
00:36:06,220 --> 00:36:07,220
Oh, okay.

726
00:36:07,220 --> 00:36:08,220
That long ago, dude?

727
00:36:08,220 --> 00:36:09,220
Yeah.

728
00:36:09,220 --> 00:36:10,220
Fucking Christ.

729
00:36:10,220 --> 00:36:11,220
That's crazy.

730
00:36:11,220 --> 00:36:12,220
Yeah.

731
00:36:12,220 --> 00:36:14,220
Time just keeps on slipping.

732
00:36:14,220 --> 00:36:15,220
Pretty crazy.

733
00:36:15,220 --> 00:36:16,220
Into the future.

734
00:36:16,220 --> 00:36:25,500
the future yeah someone says give me some damn LeBron 12 that's right that's how

735
00:36:25,500 --> 00:36:28,460
the movie would do really well as you remember how like the Yu-Gi-Oh movie and

736
00:36:28,460 --> 00:36:30,900
the Pokemon movies would come with free trading cards

737
00:36:30,900 --> 00:36:37,140
Oh come with free shoes or they give you some shoes to wear or with Yu-Gi-Oh

738

00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:33,120
In the words of Andy Parsons,

"A man once saw the story of a depressed loser having a wank,

777
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:39,040
then he knew what it was called. A blank screen."

778
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:39,860
Whoa.

This comment from pet sounds.

The funny thing about this list, besides awful movies, every single one of these

831
00:42:51,500 --> 00:42:54,580
ideas would make a fabulous Monty Python sketch.

832
00:42:54,580 --> 00:42:57,100
I love Monty Python.

833
00:42:57,100 --> 00:43:00,060

00:43:10,600 --> 00:43:13,460
they would keep switching out of being like and now for something completely

837
00:43:13,460 --> 00:43:14,180
different

838
00:43:14,180 --> 00:43:19,100
uh...

839
00:43:19,100 --> 00:43:20,940

840
00:43:20,940 --> 00:43:24,620

841
00:43:24,620 --> 00:43:27,020

842
00:43:27,020 --> 00:43:28,780

843
00:43:28,780 --> 00:43:29,620
or

844
00:43:29,620 --> 00:43:31,260

845
00:43:31,260 --> 00:43:34,820
What my penis is out? It's stiff as a wood plank

846
00:43:34,820 --> 00:43:39,100
It's dead as a rock

847
00:43:39,100 --> 00:43:47,540
Number seven sparkly blue unicorns on a quest to planet Hufflepuff. Yeah, okay sounds fucking awesome. Yeah, that's Caleb's

848
00:43:47,540 --> 00:43:54,440
There's some IP problems there, but yeah Hufflepuff we'd have to change to

849
00:43:57,820 --> 00:44:00,940
project it's a stoner movie. Like Mac and Devin go to high school.

850
00:44:00,940 --> 00:44:05,180
Right? Mac and Devin go to space. Mac and Devin go to planet Huff and Puff.

851
00:44:05,180 --> 00:44:09,100
Uh-huh. Oh my god. Mac and Devin go to the

852
00:44:09,100 --> 00:44:16,620
planet Puff Puff Pass. Yeah. It says the atmosphere is almost completely THC.

853
00:44:16,620 --> 00:44:22,620
Well the best part of Mac and Devin is like the is Wiz Khalifa doing fake

854
00:44:22,620 --> 00:44:25,900
science. Yeah. Hey Caleb you should you should

855
00:44:25,900 --> 00:44:31,500
read this comment. No, keep going, sorry. No, keep talking. Just Mac it like, have you

856
00:44:31,500 --> 00:44:36,580
guys seen Mac and Devin go to high school? I have not. I've seen the end of it. The, the, the

857
00:44:36,580 --> 00:44:42,820
whole thing is like, apparently weed is like an endless like renewable energy

858
00:44:42,820 --> 00:44:47,300
source at the end. And Wiz Khalifa is like, we needed a, we, I created a

859
00:44:47,300 --> 00:44:51,420
renewable energy source that needed a catalyst. And the catalyst, we knew it had

860
00:44:51,420 --> 00:44:59,240
some three letters in it and it turns out they were THC. So fucking sick. It's awesome. I

861
00:44:59,240 --> 00:45:04,820
watched Wiz Khalifa on a Call of Duty Warzone stream the other day and he was with this

862
00:45:04,820 --> 00:45:11,720
guy XQC who's like this this like Swedish guy and Wiz just hated this dude so much.

863
00:45:11,720 --> 00:45:16,720
They were, Wiz was there, he was supposed to be like raising money for some charity

864
00:45:16,720 --> 00:45:21,440
But he was like getting really drunk and so the guy asked him he was like he was like

865
00:45:21,440 --> 00:45:25,120
Yo, whiz how much money do you want to raise for the stream?

866
00:45:25,120 --> 00:45:30,100
And whiz was like man. Honestly, I don't care if we raise a single dollar

867
00:45:30,100 --> 00:45:39,680
And then xqc they started talking about like xqc was like so you have kids whiz what is that like to have kids and he's like

868
00:45:39,680 --> 00:45:41,120
Do you have kids?

869
00:45:41,120 --> 00:45:43,280
And xqc was like, I don't have kids yet

870
00:45:43,360 --> 00:45:46,160
I'm afraid that if they come out, they will be little monsters."

871
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:49,060
And then there was like a long pause, and then Wiz was just like,

872
00:45:49,060 --> 00:45:51,360
"Are you a monster?"

873
00:45:51,360 --> 00:45:54,660
[laughter]

874
00:45:54,660 --> 00:45:57,860
It's the greatest fucking shit I've ever seen. I watched it for like an hour and a half.

875
00:45:57,860 --> 00:45:58,660
That's great.

876
00:45:58,660 --> 00:45:59,460
Yeah, that rules.

877
00:45:59,460 --> 00:46:00,160
You should--

878
00:46:00,160 --> 00:46:03,760
Caleb, you're gonna really like this comment from SirSkeletorThe3rd.

879
00:46:03,760 --> 00:46:05,360
You should read this one.

880
00:46:05,360 --> 00:46:05,960
You think so?

881
00:46:05,960 --> 00:46:06,460
Yeah.

882
00:46:06,460 --> 00:46:06,960
Let's see.

883
00:46:09,660 --> 00:46:17,260
A sparkly blue Nazi unicorn named Hans Reich and his friends Fiedrich Panzermouth and Joe

884
00:46:17,260 --> 00:46:21,540
go into space and battle all kinds of creatures such as humans, Jewish aliens, and yes of

885
00:46:21,540 --> 00:46:26,520
course Soviet alien dragons breathing blood in the sky in order to save planet Hufflepuff

886
00:46:26,520 --> 00:46:29,340
from evil Joseph Stalin dragon.

887
00:46:29,340 --> 00:46:34,100
Rated R for Glore, Blood, Extreme Violence, Extreme Language, and Anti-Semite Views.

888
00:46:34,100 --> 00:46:36,360
(laughter)

889
00:46:36,360 --> 00:46:37,860
- Can you imagine?

890
00:46:37,860 --> 00:46:40,700
Like a movie that's rated R,

891
00:46:40,700 --> 00:46:42,640
usually like the newest Will Ferrell movie comes out

892
00:46:42,640 --> 00:46:45,600
and it's rated R, but just for anti-Semite views.

893
00:46:45,600 --> 00:46:48,360
- Yeah, I'm waiting on the Red Band trailer for that one.

894
00:46:48,360 --> 00:46:50,720
- Yeah, it's like, you know how they have like the,

895
00:46:50,720 --> 00:46:52,640
like the South Park bigger, longer, and uncut,

896
00:46:52,640 --> 00:46:56,640
and it does that like cut, it's like bigger, longer, uncut.

897
00:46:56,640 --> 00:46:57,480
- Yeah.

898
00:46:57,480 --> 00:46:59,840
- And it's like, it's just like,

899
00:47:01,840 --> 00:47:06,840
Unicorns, dragons, anti-semitism.

900
00:47:06,840 --> 00:47:13,840
Yeah, or like a 2006 comedy like American Pie, but then the DVD comes out and they have the anti-semitic version.

901
00:47:13,840 --> 00:47:19,840
Unrated, anti-semitic edition.

902
00:47:19,840 --> 00:47:22,840
Over 40 minutes of unused footage.

903
00:47:22,840 --> 00:47:25,840
I heard they're giving every single movie an Ike cut.

904
00:47:25,840 --> 00:47:30,840
A David Ike, David Ike's cut. He's re-editing every movie.

905
00:47:30,840 --> 00:47:33,100
(laughing)

906
00:47:33,100 --> 00:47:36,680
Number eight, War of Glue.

907
00:47:36,680 --> 00:47:37,760
(laughing)

908
00:47:37,760 --> 00:47:38,800
- That's pretty good.

909
00:47:38,800 --> 00:47:40,400
- I really like the comment on this one

910
00:47:40,400 --> 00:47:42,600
from Blue Topaz Ice Vanilla that says,

911
00:47:42,600 --> 00:47:44,960
it sounds like a Hunger Games rip off.

912
00:47:44,960 --> 00:47:46,840
- It does.

913
00:47:46,840 --> 00:47:47,940
- Yeah, Glue Games.

914
00:47:47,940 --> 00:47:49,640
- War of Glue.

915
00:47:49,640 --> 00:47:51,040
- Sounds like a, like a,

916
00:47:51,040 --> 00:47:54,900
like an animal rights documentary about like horses.

917
00:47:54,900 --> 00:47:55,760
- Yeah.

918
00:47:55,760 --> 00:47:57,120
- Yeah.

919
00:47:57,120 --> 00:47:58,120
- War of Glue.

920
00:47:58,120 --> 00:47:59,080
- War of Glue.

921
00:47:59,080 --> 00:48:04,980
A battle starts in a future time and people only have glue products to defend themselves.

922
00:48:04,980 --> 00:48:06,220
Who will win?

923
00:48:06,220 --> 00:48:09,560
You know, people thought, this guy thought the future was going to be war of glue, but

924
00:48:09,560 --> 00:48:13,720
nowadays it's looking more like war of gluten, the way these hipsters are coming at the world.

925
00:48:13,720 --> 00:48:15,720
Oh my god, yes.

926
00:48:15,720 --> 00:48:16,720
It is like that.

927
00:48:16,720 --> 00:48:17,720
Keep going.

928
00:48:17,720 --> 00:48:18,720
Make it happen, folks.

929
00:48:18,720 --> 00:48:20,640
You know, why didn't the hipster eat his muffin?

930
00:48:20,640 --> 00:48:23,400
Because he ate it before the gluten was cool.

931
00:48:23,400 --> 00:48:26,480
Oh my god, dude.

932
00:48:26,480 --> 00:48:28,400
They're going to put that in the movie, I heard.

933
00:48:28,400 --> 00:48:30,400
I heard they're putting that line in the script right now.

934
00:48:30,400 --> 00:48:32,400
They're putting the war of gluten in the movie.

935
00:48:32,400 --> 00:48:34,400
We should rail against hipsters more.

936
00:48:34,400 --> 00:48:36,400
Yeah.

937
00:48:36,400 --> 00:48:38,400
Freaking...

952
00:49:26,160 --> 00:49:30,160
Just growing up, my younger brother would go to Starbucks

00:49:30,160 --> 00:49:33,440
and get any frozen drink there,

954
00:49:33,440 --> 00:49:35,640
and my dad would just always own him.

955
00:49:35,640 --> 00:49:36,700
When he would bring it back, he'd be like,

956
00:49:36,700 --> 00:49:39,240
"Hey, nice frappa girl-a-cino."

957
00:49:39,240 --> 00:49:40,400
Damn.

And it was like, "Dad, can you watch it, dude?"

959
00:49:42,440 --> 00:49:43,280
Yeah.

960
00:49:43,280 --> 00:49:45,520
"Woo, cool it, Dave Attell."

00:49:45,520 --> 00:49:46,360
Yeah.

962
00:49:46,360 --> 00:49:47,360
"What's that about?

963
00:49:47,360 --> 00:49:48,640
"Coming after your own kid like that?

964
00:49:48,640 --> 00:49:50,480
"He can't even defend himself, dude."

965
00:49:50,480 --> 00:49:51,720
Dude, he's a kid.

966
00:49:51,720 --> 00:49:53,360
He's not Dave Attell.

967
00:49:53,360 --> 00:49:54,960
"Dude, he's not the joke writer you are.

968
00:49:54,960 --> 00:49:56,660
Frappa Garlaccino.

00:50:18,480 --> 00:50:20,720
Oh, I'm sorry.

Yeah, what's that? Because you love the clowns in Congress?

986
00:50:25,840 --> 00:50:26,340
Yeah.

987
00:50:26,340 --> 00:50:26,840
Yeah, that's right.

988
00:50:26,840 --> 00:50:30,520
I see you wearing a flannel. I wish I could change the damn channel.

989
00:50:30,520 --> 00:50:39,320
*laughter*

990
00:50:39,320 --> 00:50:39,820
Have you ever seen the, uh...

991
00:50:39,820 --> 00:50:42,120
Oh, so you're wearing, you're covered in tattoos?

992
00:50:42,120 --> 00:50:44,120
I'm gonna throw a rock at you.

993
00:50:44,120 --> 00:50:47,120
Or we're, this is my anti-hipster rap I'm working on.

994
00:50:47,120 --> 00:50:52,520
Have you seen the Dennis Miller, or Dennis Leary, uh, coffee bit?

995
00:50:52,520 --> 00:50:53,520
No.

996
00:50:53,520 --> 00:50:57,120
Yeah, where he's just like, "What happened to coffee?

997
00:50:57,120 --> 00:50:58,920
What happened to a cup of coffee?

998
00:50:58,920 --> 00:51:04,640
Now that you put milk and sugar in it, what are you, Chinese?"

999
00:51:04,640 --> 00:51:09,880
The punchline to that joke is, "www.whatthefuck.com!"

1000
00:51:09,880 --> 00:51:12,200
Plug in his good friend Mark Maron, dude.

1001
00:51:12,200 --> 00:51:13,200
Yeah.

1002
00:51:13,200 --> 00:51:15,280
Hey, hipster, I see you grew up.

1003
00:51:15,280 --> 00:51:19,680
Have you seen Dennis Leary's coffee bit where he takes a sip of coffee and says, "Pow, I

1004
00:51:19,680 --> 00:51:21,560
just shit my pants?"

1005
00:51:21,560 --> 00:51:26,480
Hey hipster, I see you've grown a giant beard.

1006
00:51:26,480 --> 00:51:29,640

Yeah.

1073
00:55:31,120 --> 00:55:31,620
Yeah.

1074
00:55:31,620 --> 00:55:35,120
The people who made the Lego movie are gonna make the hipster movie.

1075
00:55:35,120 --> 00:55:36,120
Yes!

1076
00:55:36,120 --> 00:55:38,120
No, the people who made Scary Movie.

1077
00:55:38,120 --> 00:55:38,620
Yes!

1078
00:55:38,620 --> 00:55:43,620
It's set in Silver Lake in a coffee shop that's also a vinyl record store.

1079
00:55:43,620 --> 00:55:48,620
and it's got Aubrey Plaza and Michael Cera.

1080
00:55:48,620 --> 00:55:49,820
- Yes.

1081
00:55:49,820 --> 00:55:52,660
- And Dwight Schrute is there.

1082
00:55:52,660 --> 00:55:55,220
- Yeah, Dwight Schrute is there and he's saying false.

1083
00:55:55,220 --> 00:55:56,060
- Yeah.

1084
00:55:56,060 --> 00:55:56,900
- He's saying false.

1085
00:55:56,900 --> 00:56:00,500
- Yeah, he's like, can I, yeah, he's the barista.

1086
00:56:00,500 --> 00:56:02,860
And somebody says, yeah, can I get a black coffee?

1087
00:56:02,860 --> 00:56:04,140
And he says, false.

1088
00:56:04,140 --> 00:56:04,960
- Yeah.

1089
00:56:04,960 --> 00:56:07,580
- We only have girl coffee that's just milk.

1090
00:56:07,580 --> 00:56:08,420
- Yeah.

1091
00:56:08,420 --> 00:56:09,940
- And we put a single coffee bean in it,

1092
00:56:09,940 --> 00:56:11,440
like a toy in a cereal box,

1093
00:56:11,440 --> 00:56:12,280
and you have to find it.

1094
00:56:12,280 --> 00:56:13,100
- And then, yeah.

1095
00:56:13,100 --> 00:56:15,580
And then Dennis, he gets so mad.

1096
00:56:15,580 --> 00:56:16,860
- Oh, and you know who Dennis is.

1097
00:56:16,860 --> 00:56:20,540
- Yeah, and Dennis says, "You're a real asshole.

1098
00:56:20,540 --> 00:56:21,380
"You're an asshole."

1099
00:56:21,380 --> 00:56:23,460
- And then he says, "I'm an asshole!"

1100
00:56:23,460 --> 00:56:25,300
- And then Louis C.K. comes up and he's like,

1101
00:56:25,300 --> 00:56:27,700
"I stole that joke, or you stole that joke from me."

1102
00:56:27,700 --> 00:56:28,900
- You stole that joke from me.

1103
00:56:28,900 --> 00:56:31,140
- You actually stole that asshole joke from me.

1104
00:56:31,140 --> 00:56:35,720
And he says, "How about a cup of black coffee?"

1105
00:56:35,720 --> 00:56:38,080
- Yeah.

1106
00:56:38,080 --> 00:56:38,900
- And that's the end of the movie.

1107
00:56:38,900 --> 00:56:39,860
- Mocha Frappa What the Fucka.

1108
00:56:39,860 --> 00:56:40,700
- Yeah.

1109
00:56:40,700 --> 00:56:41,540
- Mocha Frappa What the Fucka.

1110
00:56:41,540 --> 00:56:43,620
- Moka-cino. - Get in your fuckin' pants, dude.

1111
00:56:43,620 --> 00:56:44,820
Moka come in your butt?

1112
00:56:44,820 --> 00:56:47,220

1113
00:56:47,220 --> 00:56:49,980
Yeah, how 'bout he's wearing Cinos and they're skinny.

1114
00:56:49,980 --> 00:56:52,220
- Yeah, oh my God. - Yeah, there we go.

1115
00:56:52,220 --> 00:56:55,440

00:56:58,860 --> 00:57:01,860
Genny, jeans are genny. (laughing)

1118
00:57:01,860 --> 00:57:08,740
- It's true, man.

1119
00:57:08,740 --> 00:57:10,420
- It's just a complete shit.

1120
00:57:10,420 --> 00:57:12,660
You have a mustache tattooed on your finger?

1121
00:57:12,660 --> 00:57:15,500
I'm gonna make you smell my finger.

1122
00:57:15,500 --> 00:57:19,180
I have a rust rash that I got from working in the yard.

1123
00:57:19,180 --> 00:57:21,020
You bitch.

1124
00:57:21,020 --> 00:57:23,700
Mustache on your finger? Yeah.

1125
00:57:23,700 --> 00:57:25,900
I'm gonna go home and watch The Ringer.

1126
00:57:25,900 --> 00:57:26,780
Oh, you're at...

1127
00:57:26,780 --> 00:57:32,100
Oh, you're at Starbucks?

1128
00:57:32,100 --> 00:57:33,620
I'm in the car drunk.

1129
00:57:33,620 --> 00:57:35,860
(laughing)

1130
00:57:35,860 --> 00:57:42,180
- Oh, fuck.

1131
00:57:42,180 --> 00:57:47,620
- Number 10 is Rain.

1132
00:57:47,620 --> 00:57:49,300
There's tons of Rain movies on YouTube.

1133
00:57:49,300 --> 00:57:50,380
- Yeah. - Yeah.

1134
00:57:50,380 --> 00:57:52,220
- Yeah, you just search Rain movie.

1135
00:57:52,220 --> 00:57:53,060
- I watch a movie about Rain all the time.

1136
00:57:53,060 --> 00:57:55,700
- They already made a movie about a man made out of Rain.

1137
00:57:55,700 --> 00:57:57,460
- Yeah, we did. - Max Rain.

1138
00:57:57,460 --> 00:57:59,100
- Yeah. - Yeah.

1139
00:57:59,100 --> 00:57:59,940
That was the movie.

1140
00:57:59,940 --> 00:58:01,620
That was the movie, it was Max Rain.

1141
00:58:01,620 --> 00:58:03,620
I was thinking of Rain and Gain.

1142
00:58:03,620 --> 00:58:04,620
Yeah.

1143
00:58:04,620 --> 00:58:07,620
That's the one where it's Rain Man and Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson.

1144
00:58:07,620 --> 00:58:09,620
[Laughter]

1145
00:58:09,620 --> 00:58:11,620
They made Rain Go too.

1146
00:58:11,620 --> 00:58:12,620
[Laughter]

1147
00:58:12,620 --> 00:58:21,620
Dude, imagine fucking, imagine Pain and Gain, but it's Dustin Hoffman as Rain Man instead of Mark Wahlberg.

1148
00:58:21,620 --> 00:58:23,620
Instead of Milk Wahlberg?

1149
00:58:23,620 --> 00:58:25,620
Milk Wahlberg. That's a different guy.

1150
00:58:25,620 --> 00:58:28,620
That's what he puts in the freaking, that's what Dennis Leary puts in his coffee.

1151
00:58:28,620 --> 00:58:31,360
- No, Mark Wahlberg is one of the normal,

1152
00:58:31,360 --> 00:58:33,360
he's not a hipster.

1153
00:58:33,360 --> 00:58:36,600
- No, Dennis Miller puts Milk Wahlberg in his coffee,

1154
00:58:36,600 --> 00:58:37,700
or Dennis Leary.

1155
00:58:37,700 --> 00:58:38,740
- Dennis Miller.

1156
00:58:38,740 --> 00:58:40,540
- Dennis Milker.

1157
00:58:40,540 --> 00:58:41,840
- Wow.

1158
00:58:41,840 --> 00:58:46,440
- Milk Walk, the milk man, Dennis.

1159
00:58:46,440 --> 00:58:47,280
- Let's see Dennis's milkers.

1160
00:58:47,280 --> 00:58:49,180
- The milk man walks through your berg

1161
00:58:49,180 --> 00:58:50,420
and he delivers milk.

1162
00:58:50,420 --> 00:58:52,380
- I wanna see Dennis Miller's Dennis milkers.

1163
00:58:52,380 --> 00:58:54,760
- Yeah, Mark Wahlberg, more like Milk Walk.

1164
00:58:54,760 --> 00:58:55,600
- Men.

1165
00:58:55,600 --> 00:58:56,420
- Men, but.

1166
00:58:56,420 --> 00:58:57,260
(laughing)

1167
00:58:57,260 --> 00:58:58,540
Milk Walkman.

1168
00:58:58,540 --> 00:58:59,540
Milk Walkman?

1169
00:58:59,540 --> 00:59:00,540
Yeah.

1170
00:59:00,540 --> 00:59:01,540
Milk Walkman.

1171
00:59:01,540 --> 00:59:02,540
Who's Milk Walkman?

1172
00:59:02,540 --> 00:59:04,540
He's the guy who walks around, he walks to your house.

1173
00:59:04,540 --> 00:59:05,540
He's the milk man?

1174
00:59:05,540 --> 00:59:06,540
Hey, you're kinda like Milk Walkman.

1175
00:59:06,540 --> 00:59:07,540
You know, you remind me of this actor.

1176
00:59:07,540 --> 00:59:16,060
I don't remember his name, he used to be a rapper too.

1177
00:59:16,060 --> 00:59:20,100
He put the herd on a Vietnamese man in South Boston once.

1178
00:59:20,100 --> 00:59:21,100
