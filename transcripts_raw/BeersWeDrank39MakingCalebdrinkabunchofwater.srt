You said?

30
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:27,160
This is two or three hundred I believe.

31
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:28,160
Ah yeah.

32
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:38,040
So, in the spirit of Sitsmas everybody, today I have gone ahead and brought on a classic

33
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:40,700
Christmas beer in Mexico.

34
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:43,200
It's called Noche Buena.

35
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:44,200
Which

36
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:45,200
See that could be not true.

37
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:46,200
We can't check you on this.

38
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:48,480
Yeah, this could be a complete lie.

39
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:51,880
- Okay, well you can Google the name of the beer.

40
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:53,720
- You probably just got a red beer.

41
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:55,600
- This is a seasonal beer.

42
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:59,160
It only comes out around the holidays

43
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:01,520
and Nacho Buena, when you translate it,

44
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:03,560
it stands for Christmas Eve.

45
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:08,040
These are really famous, people really like these.

46
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:10,100
So much so that I think for some time

47
00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:12,580
they made them available year round.

48
00:02:12,580 --> 00:02:14,240
But I don't know if that's still a thing

49
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:17,040
or which is like a one time deal.

50
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:20,400
Anyways, I got, I saw one, I got one, and I'm gonna drink it now.

51
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:26,000
It looks amazing, I'm not gonna lie. I like the foil top.

52
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Yeah, I like it.

53
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Wow, I like it!

54
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
What does it taste like?

55
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
It tastes completely like a beer.

56
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Though it's made in Mexico.

57
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
You're kidding!

58
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
No.

59
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
And it's got 5.9% alcohol.

60
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
What's your problem, man?

61
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Okay, that's pretty decent.

62
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,280
and it's I feel like it's filling me up with the Christmas spirit.

63
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:52,800
I want to give gifts to my friends.

64
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:56,320
Uh hey I'll take a gift I've never said no to one.

65
00:02:56,320 --> 00:03:03,120
Guys uh my wife picked my beer again my lovely wife shout out to her for doing this this is amazing

66
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:11,440
to have this uh done for me and she picked out speaking of Christmas beers fugly sweater.

67
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:14,160
Oh that's awesome.

68
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:19,160
A dark lager brewed with ginger, cloves, nutmeg and cinnamon.

69
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:21,160
That's a Christmas beer.

70
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:26,160
I would fucking hope so. I'm gonna take a sip and report back.

71
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:33,160
Yeah, something I don't tell you about reviewing beers is that it's really hard to tell what's in them when there's no labels with the ingredients.

72
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:36,160
Just the title of the beer.

73
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:43,160
Okay, I'm gonna say this tastes like a bit of a flat Guinness.

74
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:48,740
This is like a non-nitro Guinness.

75
00:03:48,740 --> 00:03:53,740
It has a lot of darkly deep flavor to it.

76
00:03:53,740 --> 00:03:57,580
Not really getting any of the ginger, nutmeg or cinnamon,

77
00:03:57,580 --> 00:03:59,880
maybe a little bit of the cloves.

78
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:03,060
Overall, it really just tastes like a dark beer to me.

79
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:05,780
And it's okay, I'm gonna give this a five, two,

80
00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:07,280
5.2 out of 10.

81
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:09,200
- All right, now that I've taken a couple sips of this,

82
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:12,920
this is definitely a dark beer, but I actually like it.

83
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:15,400
I think you guys would also--

84
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:17,000
- That's surprising, you usually hate the--

85
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,760
- Yeah, I think you guys would really like these, yeah.

86
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:22,440
I want to give you a Christmas beer.

87
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:24,240
- I don't love dark beer usually.

88
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:25,880
I actually kinda, I like Guinness,

89
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:29,720
but that's mostly 'cause it kinda tastes like whipped cream.

90
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:32,480
Then you can give yourself a milk mustache.

91
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:34,760
- It is very milky and thick.

92
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:35,600
- Yeah.

93
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:43,640
I have a... hold on, hold on.

94
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:45,720
I do have a blue beard.

95
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:47,340
This is a sea quench ale.

96
00:04:47,340 --> 00:04:51,640
A dogfish head sea quench ale.

97
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:52,640
And it is a lime beer.

98
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:53,640
What is this?

99
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:54,640
Oh, a lime beer!

100
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:59,600
Blissfully brewed with lime juice, lime peel, black limes, and sea salt.

101
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:05,560
Did you know that this bastard up here, between you and me, is...

102
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:09,560
Well, for me, he's right over here to stage right.

103
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:10,560
Yeah.

104
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:11,560
No, it's you.

105
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:16,560
Do you know that he thinks that a lemon and a lime are the same thing in his country?

106
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:19,560
Well, he's talking about limon.

107
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:20,560
Yeah.

108
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:22,560
That's the same thing there. Isn't that wild?

109
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:23,560
It is crazy.

110
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:26,560
It's just one word. It's limon.

111
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:27,560
No, that's not true.

112
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:28,560
It's true.

113
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:30,560
I think it's its own thing.

114
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:34,560
There's limon and then there's lima.

115
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:40,560
Lima is what you guys call lemon and lime is what we call the limon.

116
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:42,560
And why is that?

117
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:44,560
Thank you guys!

118
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:51,560
Look at how amazing my life is. Amazing life, amazing wife.

119
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:53,560
I just was hand-delivered miso soup.

120
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:56,560
So this is the kind of beer that I might be indulging in pretty soon.

121
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:57,560
Wow.

122
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:59,560
I don't think that's a beer.

123
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:00,560
Shut up!

124
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:02,560
Would you say miso hungry?

125
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:06,720
I would say me so hungry if I was a fucking racist shitbag

126
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:12,800
Which I'm not so I won't say it. We already said it. You know, I didn't

127
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:18,400
What other kind of things will you say if you were a racist shitbag

128
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:22,400
Probably the thing I just said about the lines

129
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:27,920
Yeah, anyways, what's up with this line yeah, it's yummy just tastes like

130
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:30,760
beer with lime

131
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:32,760
That's very good. That's like a solid eight

132
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:39,040
You can't make any beer worse with lime. I don't think I think even this dark beer would be a little better with some

133
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:40,200
Yeah

134
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:44,560
It's my favorite beer maybe ever is Bud Light lime. Yeah

135
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:50,520
Yeah, I wasn't I went to a new grocery store to buy beer cuz I've kind of

136
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:53,360
hit every beer they have at the

137
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:58,840
Bodega near me. Yeah, and I was like, oh so many choices

138
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:03,280
And none of them really sounded appealing.

139
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:04,280
Yeah.

140
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:07,280
It's always like this with stuff.

141
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:12,200
I was afraid that that was going to happen to me as well when I was living in my apartment,

142
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:13,200
which I've moved out of.

143
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:14,200
We'll talk about that later.

144
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:19,840
There was like this 7-Eleven near me that I used to just hit up.

145
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:25,280
And I ran so dry on options that I was considering getting the soju last time.

146
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:28,520
It was between that and I didn't find it again.

147
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:32,520
I'm running out of interesting beers in my area.

148
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:38,800
I will have to start making treks to different parts of this city, which is a bummer for

149
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:41,200
me because I hate moving my body.

150
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:43,400
Yeah, I'm the same way.

151
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:44,400
Yeah.

152
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:53,840
So, I have a thing with like, you know, theoretically, logically, it would make sense to buy a bunch

153
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:58,160
a different beer at a store once and keep them in the fridge for weeks at a time.

154
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:04,160
But that is impossible because a beer in the fridge might as well have already been drank.

155
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:05,160
That's right.

156
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:09,880
There's no way that a beer will not drink these beers that are sitting in the fridge.

157
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:10,880
Yeah.

158
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:17,800
If it's sitting there for a week between fucking recording sessions, sometimes more, you're

159
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:21,800
not going to just sit there and be like, "Oh my God, this freaking Morty beer is staring

160
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:25,800
I mean, the taste, every time I eat an egg out of the fridge,

161
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:27,300
that thing is not going to live.

162
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:29,200
You cannot have beer at your house.

163
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:32,500
I try-- the only-- I never keep alcohol in my house.

164
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:40,000
I buy alcohol, I drink it, and then I drive around my house.

165
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:40,500
Yeah.

166
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:41,500
Yeah.

167
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:42,000
Listen--

168
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,300
I do have a lot of gin right now.

169
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:45,600
I bought a big thing of gin.

170
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:47,600
New Amsterdam or what?

171
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:49,100
it's uh...

172
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:52,120
whatever noah told me to get it's like the

173
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:53,400
the botanist

174
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:56,000
can you turn down your gain a little bit?

175
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,760
turn down my gain?

176
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:01,520
you fucking wish you bitch ass motherfucker

177
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:04,360
you can't just drink gin on its own

178
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:05,600
you need like...

179
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:07,080
L that to my dad man

180
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:08,680
well that is true

181
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:10,680
i mean you absolutely can just drink it

182
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:12,200
but why would you do that?

183
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:16,240
well...

184
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:18,240
Well why not? Mix it with something tasty.

185
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:20,240
I'm not sure what you mean.

186
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:22,240
Well fuck you then.

187
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:24,240
I guess I'm a fucking idiot.

188
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:26,240
I'm in your camp. I think you're winning this debate.

189
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:34,240
Gin is definitely the weirdest of all of the major spirits to drink neat for sure.

190
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:36,240
Right.

191
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:38,240
It's mostly enjoyed with a tonic.

192
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:40,240
And you run out of it.

193
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:44,240
I think that's a diet tonic by the way guys.

194
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:47,240
Yeah, I should just get a big thing of tonic.

195
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:52,240
I was making gimlets for myself with bodega lime juice.

196
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:53,240
Oh wow.

197
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:55,240
And I ran out of that.

198
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:56,240
How were those?

199
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:57,240
They were delicious, obviously.

200
00:09:57,240 --> 00:10:00,240
What's that, gin, lime juice, simple syrup, that's it?

201
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:03,240
Sugar, simple syrup, is that what you want to do?

202
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:05,240
That sounds pretty good to me.

203
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:08,240
Yeah, I actually think I'd like one instead of this brown beer I have.

204
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:13,600
I have yeah, I'm considering taking it as like, you know, if I'm too lazy to get beer

205
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:20,620
I'll just make them make a cocktail. Yeah, we did we did liquor that one time, but we have not cocktails

206
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:27,120
We haven't that would be interesting during season two beers. We drink season two. We might

207
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:32,480
We might actually be making some kind of smoked

208
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:34,960
infused

209
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:36,960
bourbon drink

210
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:38,960
You know what we should do also?

211
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:42,960
We should make these cocktails while we're recording.

212
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:44,960
We should record them in the kitchen.

213
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:46,960
Yeah, we would have to. We would have to do it.

214
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:53,960
That's the only way that it would make sense because I think that each of us would individually fail in unique ways at putting together a real cocktail.

215
00:10:53,960 --> 00:11:00,960
This is actually really funny. When I was studying my real major, we had some sort of mixology class.

216
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:02,960
So I learned how to make...

217
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:07,360
Yeah, of course a Mexican college would have like a class about getting drunk.

218
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:07,860
Anyways...

219
00:11:07,860 --> 00:11:08,660
That was math.

220
00:11:08,660 --> 00:11:09,660
Yeah.

221
00:11:09,660 --> 00:11:10,660
I, uh, I, I...

222
00:11:10,660 --> 00:11:15,660
The one part tequila, the one part limon...

223
00:11:15,660 --> 00:11:23,160
I learned how to make a bunch of drinks, uh, and then our final exam, uh, the teacher had a list...

224
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:26,660
Oh, I have to study! I'm getting to the final exam!

225
00:11:26,660 --> 00:11:31,660
Our final exam was, the teacher had a list of like drinks

226
00:11:31,660 --> 00:11:36,660
Wait, I'm just thinking about the fact that you had a mixology class in college

227
00:11:36,660 --> 00:11:38,660
It's not fucking crazy

228
00:11:38,660 --> 00:11:40,660
Dude, I went to Arizona State

229
00:11:40,660 --> 00:11:42,660
It's not that crazy

230
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:46,660
I went to TV school and I didn't have a fucking class, that's stupid

231
00:11:46,660 --> 00:11:48,660
It's not that crazy

232
00:11:48,660 --> 00:11:52,660
Mixology, was it 101? Was there a whole program?

233
00:11:52,660 --> 00:11:59,660
It makes sense with the context of the major, which I won't go into detail right now.

234
00:11:59,660 --> 00:12:00,660
It's too boring.

235
00:12:00,660 --> 00:12:04,660
Just working at the Rio Cancun, that's the major.

236
00:12:04,660 --> 00:12:15,660
Our final attempt was, the teacher had a list of drinks, and you had to just assign a random drink, and you had to just make it in front of everybody.

237
00:12:15,660 --> 00:12:22,420
And I got an 8 because I forgot to just add some ice cubes at the end.

238
00:12:22,420 --> 00:12:24,220
So I just kind of fucked it up.

239
00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:25,220
8 out of 100?

240
00:12:25,220 --> 00:12:26,220
8 out of 10.

241
00:12:26,220 --> 00:12:27,220
Oh, that's good.

242
00:12:27,220 --> 00:12:31,220
Yeah, they don't have letters in Mexico.

243
00:12:31,220 --> 00:12:32,580
They can't afford that.

244
00:12:32,580 --> 00:12:35,100
Yeah, it was fine.

245
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:41,120
But I think I did keep the PDF, so I do have like a whole book worth of like mixed drinks

246
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:42,620
and how to make them and shit.

247
00:12:42,620 --> 00:12:44,700
Oh, thank God you have that.

248
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:48,900
I don't think there's any resources online about how to make mixed drinks.

249
00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:52,860
I don't know why you're coming after me for my interesting life.

250
00:12:52,860 --> 00:12:54,260
I don't know why you care so much.

251
00:12:54,260 --> 00:12:55,260
That is interesting.

252
00:12:55,260 --> 00:12:56,260
You do have an interesting life.

253
00:12:56,260 --> 00:12:57,260
That is interesting.

254
00:12:57,260 --> 00:12:58,260
Whatever, I'll just kill myself.

255
00:12:58,260 --> 00:13:04,940
And if you, I mean if you want to get mad at Rex, you can ask him why he is fully Native

256
00:13:04,940 --> 00:13:05,940
American today.

257
00:13:05,940 --> 00:13:06,940
Why are you there?

258
00:13:06,940 --> 00:13:08,900
You are the second person to say that to me.

259
00:13:08,900 --> 00:13:10,380
I'm surprised I'm the second.

260
00:13:10,380 --> 00:13:13,100
I would have thought it would have been 100 or 200 people.

261
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:14,100
Who was the first person?

262
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:16,100
I did walk very fast.

263
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:18,100
That must be the second person you've talked to today.

264
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:22,100
Wait, who was the first person?

265
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:24,100
My roommate who looked at me and said

266
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:26,100
"You look hella Native American today."

267
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:28,100
Yeah.

268
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:30,100
What's up with that man?

269
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:32,100
I finally brushed my hair.

270
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:34,100
So I'm trying to keep it from getting tangled again.

271
00:13:34,100 --> 00:13:36,100
I think something else also changed.

272
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:38,100
Aside from that.

273
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:40,100
It's the shaving.

274
00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:42,100
Right, I forgot that I did that.

275
00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:46,100
mixed with the braided hair mixed with that cardigan

276
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:48,100
I just brushed my hair and it just came out like this

277
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:50,100
That's the only thing that changed

278
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:53,100
My hair has been brushed

279
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:54,100
It's also the slit

280
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:57,100
I was thinking the braids, that's why my hair is in braids

281
00:13:57,100 --> 00:13:59,100
It's your whole look, basically

282
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:00,100
Right

283
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:03,100
Is this the new cardigan that you were looking for?

284
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:04,100
Yeah

285
00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:07,100
This motherfucker bought a cardigan on grailed, I never heard of that

286
00:14:07,100 --> 00:14:09,100
I did, I did, look at it

287
00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:11,100
You ever heard of bright clothes on grailed?

288
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:24,380
is

289
00:14:24,380 --> 00:14:26,380
I do see mistletoe as well.

290
00:14:26,380 --> 00:14:28,380
There is mistletoe in there!

291
00:14:28,380 --> 00:14:30,380
Wait, yeah, I think this is it.

292
00:14:30,380 --> 00:14:32,380
There's stars.

293
00:14:32,380 --> 00:14:36,380
It is! I got it and I did not expect it to be so Christmas vibes.

294
00:14:36,380 --> 00:14:38,380
But as a Jewish person, I looked at it and I was like,

295
00:14:38,380 --> 00:14:41,380
this is like an outdoorsy type thing.

296
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:44,380
And then I was like, wait, this is actually completely Christmas.

297
00:14:44,380 --> 00:14:46,380
Are you going home for Christmas?

298
00:14:46,380 --> 00:14:47,380
I am.

299
00:14:47,380 --> 00:14:49,380
See? So why?

300
00:14:49,380 --> 00:14:51,380
If you're so Jewish.

301
00:14:51,380 --> 00:14:52,980
Uh, because...

302
00:14:52,980 --> 00:14:54,980
If you're so Jewish, why have you come home?

303
00:14:54,980 --> 00:14:57,780
Here's the Jewish answer. Here's the Jewish answer.

304
00:14:57,780 --> 00:15:03,620
Uh, my mom has been yelling at me for the past month and a half because I have not come home all year.

305
00:15:03,620 --> 00:15:05,380
Mmm.

306
00:15:05,380 --> 00:15:05,880
Which...

307
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:07,700
So it's mom's fault.

308
00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:11,620
Well, Jewish mothers, notoriously annoying.

309
00:15:11,620 --> 00:15:13,780
Mmm, okay.

310
00:15:13,780 --> 00:15:15,940
So comment, don't have me.

311
00:15:15,940 --> 00:15:23,940
Right. My mom annoyed me until I agreed to come home, and flying home at Christmas kind of makes sense anyway.

312
00:15:23,940 --> 00:15:28,940
Because everyone leaves during Christmas. No one's home in New York during Christmas.

313
00:15:28,940 --> 00:15:33,940
Well, except for me. Little old me. In New York City, all alone.

314
00:15:33,940 --> 00:15:39,940
Yeah, my wife's family's coming into town, we decided to do Christmas here this year.

315
00:15:39,940 --> 00:15:44,940
It's ruining my life, that's why we're remodeling the entire house so quickly, fast.

316
00:15:44,940 --> 00:15:46,940
Oh, that's fucked. I'm sorry, man.

317
00:15:46,940 --> 00:15:51,000
yeah and then also i realized today though i talked to my mom about i was

318
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,940
like you have not got a come over christmas

319
00:15:52,940 --> 00:15:54,120
that's my grandma

320
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:58,280
look a month ago knows that you have not come home a minute i'll come in january

321
00:15:58,280 --> 00:16:00,620
just to see everybody but will be there for christmas

322
00:16:00,620 --> 00:16:02,980
and then today ten days out from christmas

323
00:16:02,980 --> 00:16:04,300
t-minus ten

324
00:16:04,300 --> 00:16:07,980
i forgot to that i had not talked my dad about it yet

325
00:16:07,980 --> 00:16:12,440
so tomorrow i have to call my dad one week before christmas and be like

326
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:19,440
and just so you know i forgot about you and i'm not going to

327
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:22,480
so that's going to be a really good phone call. I think what i'm going to do is

328
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:26,000
i'm going to couch it in, I was talking to cam about this

329
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:30,280
tomorrow i need to go rotate the tires on my car

330
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:34,960
which is going to take a while and i'm not going to pay some scumbag mechanic to do it

331
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:38,760
i'll just go rotate the tires on my car, i'll have to jack it up a million times, i have a spare

332
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:41,000
that i can pop between all of them

333
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
And it's gonna take a long time

334
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:46,860
But I'm gonna call my dad when I'm doing that and be like, yeah

335
00:16:46,860 --> 00:16:51,660
I'm rotating my the tires on my car and he's gonna be so just

336
00:16:51,660 --> 00:16:56,660
Impressed by that that I think I can kind of say anything I need to say after that

337
00:16:56,660 --> 00:17:00,460
Okay, you kind of won't even hear it. I do have a story about this

338
00:17:00,460 --> 00:17:05,820
So one time I was driving my car and I was going to see my dad

339
00:17:05,820 --> 00:17:08,000
and

340
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:12,000
And I got a flat tire. Maybe like, on the highway.

341
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:19,000
And so I, you know, realized I had a flat tire, got off the highway, pulled into like the closest like parking lot I could find.

342
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:23,000
And I called my dad, because he was like two miles away. I was like, "Hey, you know what? I got a flat tire."

343
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:27,000
He's like, "Alright, I'll come get you. We'll get this taken care of."

344
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:33,000
And then he watched me struggle to change the tire on my car while laughing.

345
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
No, dude. This is a position...

346
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
You are a pussy.

347
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
And I'm like, I don't even know what I'm saying.

348
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:42,000
You know, it's fucking 110 degrees out.

349
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
I'm fucking dying.

350
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:48,000
I'm like, my abs hurt from like, leaning over so much.

351
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
It hurts from giggling so much.

352
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
Yeah, exactly.

353
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
My father-in-law, when I was in high school,

354
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
well before we were married,

355
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:59,000
he taught me how to

356
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
change the tire on a car.

357
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:09,000
car and it has been probably in my top 10 life skills that I've had taught to me

358
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:13,440
like no question. It was the best thing he's ever done for me because that is

359
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:17,280
such an embarrassing thing to not be able to do because especially once you

360
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:20,960
learn how to do it it's the simplest thing ever. Yeah it's not that I didn't

361
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:25,260
know how to do it it was just that I thought we would like you know go get a

362
00:18:25,260 --> 00:18:30,480
tire, put it on here, yeah and no he just watched. He just kind of leaned against

363
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:36,400
this car and watched. He owned it. Yeah that stuff. Yeah. It was very funny looking back

364
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:43,100
on it but. Okay. Jubio you look fucking lovely man. Let's address that elephant in the room.

365
00:18:43,100 --> 00:18:46,720
You look beautiful, the light is shining on you, and not only that, you look to be in a

366
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:57,240
new space. Guys, I have to come clean. I fully failed. I, Caleb texted us earlier today and

367
00:18:57,240 --> 00:19:00,720
and he was like, "Should we do eight for a beer to drink?"

368
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:02,960
And I was like, "Sounds lovely."

369
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:06,760
And then he texted me a little before eight,

370
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:08,960
it was like streaming live. - 10.55 or so.

371
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:12,080
- And I was like, "Sorry, I'm at HEV,

372
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:15,560
"I'm getting a Christmas tree and some Christmas lights."

373
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:18,080
And guys, they had Christmas trees,

374
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:19,840
they had no Christmas lights.

375
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:22,280
And there were so many people at HEV,

376
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:25,640
we just dipped and we didn't get the tree.

377
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:32,640
you should

378
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:36,440
I'm so sorry to everybody.

379
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:38,440
Oh, and also I moved into a house.

380
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:39,440
I live in a house.

381
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:41,440
He moved into a new house, you guys.

382
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:42,440
Yeah!

383
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:48,480
I fully ditched my apartment with my crazy landlord who I still haven't heard from yet.

384
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:49,480
Still haven't heard from her.

385
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:52,520
She is probably locked herself in there, starving to death.

386
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:53,520
No food, no water.

387
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:54,520
She is dying.

388
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:55,520
Yeah!

389
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:56,360
(claps)

390
00:19:56,360 --> 00:19:57,180
- Yeah!

391
00:19:57,180 --> 00:19:58,020
(claps)

392
00:19:58,020 --> 00:19:58,860
(claps)

393
00:19:58,860 --> 00:20:00,880
- It's really funny, we went,

394
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:04,760
so we moved on Saturday, which was the ninth,

395
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:07,280
which is the day after rent's due,

396
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:12,280
and I don't know why I thought that my crazy landlord,

397
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:16,520
well, I thought it would make sense for her to show up

398
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:19,680
immediately the next day at my apartment and be like,

399
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:21,480
"Where's my fucking money?"

400
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:23,840
But she didn't, and we did a whole ass move

401
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:25,760
that took the entire day.

402
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:28,280
We moved all our things, we still left some things

403
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:29,920
back at the apartment.

404
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:33,120
Sunday, next day, we go back in,

405
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:36,400
we take some stuff out that we left,

406
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:38,400
and we saw our old neighbors, and we're like,

407
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:41,600
yeah, we're moving out, our landlord fucking stinks,

408
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:43,520
and the apartment kinda sucks.

409
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:46,360
But we haven't really seen her yet.

410
00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:49,700
And they both, like the first floor neighbors,

411
00:20:49,700 --> 00:20:52,400
were like, yeah, she is really strange,

412
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:54,740
She would just knock on your door.

413
00:20:54,740 --> 00:20:56,700
She would just walk up to my neighbor's window

414
00:20:56,700 --> 00:21:01,000
and just knock on it for her to let her into the building.

415
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:01,980
- She seems haunted.

416
00:21:01,980 --> 00:21:02,820
- It's really funny.

417
00:21:02,820 --> 00:21:04,600
It's a really crazy lady.

418
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:07,580
I was like, "Oh, that's crazy.

419
00:21:07,580 --> 00:21:11,180
"Well, if she shows up, we'll just leave the key somewhere

420
00:21:11,180 --> 00:21:12,980
"and she can just take 'em, I guess."

421
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:17,100
And then, we're like, "All right," so we leave.

422
00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:20,220
And then we still left some stuff at the apartment

423
00:21:20,220 --> 00:21:22,780
and we kind of didn't feel like going back in on Monday.

424
00:21:22,780 --> 00:21:27,460
So we just left shit there until like yesterday

425
00:21:27,460 --> 00:21:28,380
where I was like, you know what?

426
00:21:28,380 --> 00:21:29,320
- That's the move.

427
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:31,580
- I might as well just go get the last thing,

428
00:21:31,580 --> 00:21:34,380
the last stuff that we left.

429
00:21:34,380 --> 00:21:38,980
So I go back in, there's no one pretty much at the building.

430
00:21:38,980 --> 00:21:40,340
I grab all the things that I left.

431
00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:41,780
There's nothing else at the apartment

432
00:21:41,780 --> 00:21:43,420
that's not just garbage.

433
00:21:43,420 --> 00:21:46,980
And I just leave the keys in like the mailbox

434
00:21:46,980 --> 00:21:48,740
that's in front of the apartment.

435
00:21:48,740 --> 00:21:52,260
And I was like, just text the neighbor that if she shows up,

436
00:21:52,260 --> 00:21:53,620
their keys are there.

437
00:21:53,620 --> 00:21:58,820
And I'm pretty much, I'm fully done with that apartment.

438
00:21:58,820 --> 00:21:59,660
- You're free.

439
00:21:59,660 --> 00:22:02,180
- I did steal a key to the building

440
00:22:02,180 --> 00:22:04,540
because my girlfriend sent some packages there

441
00:22:04,540 --> 00:22:06,700
that she needs to be retrieved.

442
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:08,180
So I do have that still.

443
00:22:08,180 --> 00:22:10,260
But other than that, I'm fully free.

444
00:22:10,260 --> 00:22:11,840
I'm in a new house.

445
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:12,680
You can see--

446
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:15,020
- What's the new landlord situation like?

447
00:22:15,020 --> 00:22:20,020
She appears to be a teacher at the state university.

448
00:22:20,020 --> 00:22:22,140
- Okay.

449
00:22:22,140 --> 00:22:22,960
- She is not--

450
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:25,420
- She appears to be, but she could be some kind of sicario.

451
00:22:25,420 --> 00:22:28,180
- Well, she's not 80 years old and crazy.

452
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:29,860
- Okay, well that's good.

453
00:22:29,860 --> 00:22:32,940
- And I've texted her about some problems with the house

454
00:22:32,940 --> 00:22:36,960
and she's been really receptive, which is really nice.

455
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:42,420
And as long as she doesn't show up knocking on my door,

456
00:22:42,420 --> 00:22:44,780
yelling at me, I don't care.

457
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:45,860
As long as-- - It's a win.

458
00:22:45,860 --> 00:22:48,340
- I really don't want to see any numbers anymore.

459
00:22:48,340 --> 00:22:51,220
I just, I'm really enjoying how big this house is.

460
00:22:51,220 --> 00:22:55,060
It's fully two floors.

461
00:22:55,060 --> 00:22:57,660
It's in a fenced in neighborhood,

462
00:22:57,660 --> 00:23:00,660
so if you wanna look up my address

463
00:23:00,660 --> 00:23:03,260
by looking at that window, you can show up.

464
00:23:03,260 --> 00:23:04,740
You can't come inside.

465
00:23:04,740 --> 00:23:07,740
There's a, I'm gonna, you know,

466
00:23:07,740 --> 00:23:10,120
there's a fence around this whole thing.

467
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:15,320
I would be very shocked and surprised if we had even a single person in Mexico listen

468
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:16,320
to this show.

469
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:17,320
Probably not.

470
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:18,320
Probably nobody.

471
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:25,000
I think if someone from Mexico listened to this show they would hate you.

472
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,000
Why?

473
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,240
Yeah, you sell out your people on a daily basis.

474
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:29,240
I do not.

475
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:30,240
What do you mean?

476
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:32,720
Yeah you do, by taking it from me and this fucking guy.

477
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:33,720
Yeah.

478
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:34,720
I guess so.

479
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:35,720
We roast you all day.

480
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:37,880
Why would you be drinking a modelo?

481
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:41,000
Yeah, defend your proud people? This guy hates beer?

482
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,680
What the hell is wrong with you?

483
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:47,160
I just don't like beer or spicy food much.

484
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:50,240
Yeah, that is literally...

485
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:52,920
Oh, what is that like, dude?

486
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:55,600
What is that? No, I know that's not fucking true.

487
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:56,560
Yeah.

488
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:59,280
I know that's not true. Yeah, this guy loves burritos and tacos.

489
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:02,680
He actually does. Listen, I like burritos and tacos.

490
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:05,440
And I like beer and I like spicy foods.

491
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:06,440
Yeah.

492
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:08,560
and I like big bottles of tequila.

493
00:24:08,560 --> 00:24:12,240
I think that if I could do it all over again,

494
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:15,880
and I was given the choice that everybody's given by God,

495
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:18,700
I would choose to be born in the richest family

496
00:24:18,700 --> 00:24:19,760
in all of Mexico.

497
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:20,600
- Right. - Yeah, that'd be--

498
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:23,240
- But I would choose to be born in Mexico.

499
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:27,480
- Well, it's, so something I noticed on this last trip

500
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:30,780
that I took to a really small town in Mexico,

501
00:24:30,780 --> 00:24:36,000
is that I'm, you know, I wasn't really born

502
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,960
and like that rich of a family or anything.

503
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:42,800
But I was lucky to be born in like a nice big city

504
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:45,760
because we went down to this like small,

505
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:47,880
like middle of Mexico town.

506
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:49,840
It just sucked.

507
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:53,160
The hotel that we stayed at had to be like in a,

508
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:55,160
you know, surrounded by a fence also

509
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:55,980
because they were like,

510
00:24:55,980 --> 00:24:57,880
"You shouldn't really walk out of here at night

511
00:24:57,880 --> 00:24:58,940
"or whatever.

512
00:24:58,940 --> 00:25:00,800
"Don't really mingle with the locals."

513
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:03,200
And we ended up--

514
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:04,320
- What's wrong with the locals?

515
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:05,320
- They were violent.

516
00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:07,400
- Vampires? - In a killing way, yeah.

517
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:09,800
- Oh, killing violent people, that's good.

518
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:13,440
- And I, so we, at some point of one of the nights,

519
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:15,960
we ended up at someone's house,

520
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:18,000
and they live in this huge house,

521
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:22,000
it's just a, they had a sort of a mansion.

522
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:26,080
It was the biggest house I had seen in years,

523
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:29,860
and I was like, this house is crazy and awesome,

524
00:25:29,860 --> 00:25:32,920
you still live in poop city, basically.

525
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:35,200
- Yeah, you can live in Poop City.

526
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:37,640
- I don't think I would take that trade, honestly.

527
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:40,240
- That's like the biggest house in North Carolina

528
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:46,160
that isn't this one house, it's like a historical thing

529
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:48,300
owned by somebody, some rich guy.

530
00:25:48,300 --> 00:25:50,280
But the biggest private piece of property

531
00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:54,840
is this giant 15-bedroom mansion,

532
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:57,760
has an 18-hole golf course, has like six pools,

533
00:25:57,760 --> 00:26:00,240
all this crazy shit, and it's like $6 million.

534
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:05,920
which in new york is like one brownstone cost six billion dollars

535
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:07,800
yeah

536
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:10,380
when he was just funny because

537
00:26:10,380 --> 00:26:14,820
it you try and buy property here and the biggest house anywhere else

538
00:26:14,820 --> 00:26:16,440
is the same

539
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:19,660
yeah it's gonna it's it's it truly is absurd

540
00:26:19,660 --> 00:26:21,380
it's not worth it

541
00:26:21,380 --> 00:26:25,120
i did see i was looking like if you try to live on my fifty-seventh have

542
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:25,900
like in life

543
00:26:25,900 --> 00:26:28,220
central park area

544
00:26:28,220 --> 00:26:29,660
Millionaire's Row.

545
00:26:29,660 --> 00:26:30,160
Yeah.

546
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:33,180
Just the like,

547
00:26:33,180 --> 00:26:36,300
homeowners association fee

548
00:26:36,300 --> 00:26:39,580
is like a mortgage on a two million dollar house.

549
00:26:39,580 --> 00:26:40,080
Alone.

550
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:40,580
Yeah.

551
00:26:40,580 --> 00:26:42,740
Not including the property, but like,

552
00:26:42,740 --> 00:26:43,920
Yeah.

553
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:44,420
Yeah.

554
00:26:44,420 --> 00:26:46,820
There was like one I saw for sale, it was like four hundred thousand.

555
00:26:46,820 --> 00:26:48,180
I was like, "Oh, that's like a good deal."

556
00:26:48,180 --> 00:26:52,180
And then it was like, "Yeah, but the homeowners is an extra five thousand a month."

557
00:26:52,180 --> 00:26:53,700
And it's probably a studio.

558
00:26:53,700 --> 00:26:56,220
No, it was like, decently sized. It was like a two bedroom.

559
00:26:56,220 --> 00:26:56,720
Really?

560
00:26:57,060 --> 00:27:01,060
I was like, "Oh, that's a good deal," but then it's like, "No, that's still $7,000 a month."

561
00:27:01,060 --> 00:27:06,500
One of those big skyscrapers on the south end of Central Park has this thing where

562
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:15,420
if you become a member of it, or if you buy a unit, you have to become a member of their community thing.

563
00:27:15,420 --> 00:27:23,020
And it's like a country club where you have to spend X amount of money at the restaurant,

564
00:27:23,020 --> 00:27:26,480
but that amount they have to spend the restaurant every year is like fifteen

565
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:28,400
thousand dollars

566
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:32,600
that's a lot of like a half of his spend at the restaurant

567
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:33,780
that's crazy

568
00:27:33,780 --> 00:27:35,640
that's so awesome dude

569
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:38,320
you go in and you just get uh...

570
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:41,180
here's what i would do medical such a nice guy

571
00:27:41,180 --> 00:27:43,200
uh... i go in

572
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:46,720
i would say can i have one it cannot have seven apple

573
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:49,080
justin apple or ron apple don't even cut it

574
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:51,200
and the apple

575
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:54,480
Apple costs what? How much does an apple cost? 15, 20 bucks?

576
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:56,280
I think it's like $30.

577
00:27:56,280 --> 00:28:03,120
Okay, so I pay $30 and then I tip my waiter $14,970.

578
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:04,720
I don't think that counts.

579
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:10,680
And then, the next month, I get kicked out for two reasons.

580
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:14,680
Number one, I thought that that worked and that I could stay there.

581
00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:17,680
But number two, I spent all my money on this apple.

582
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:20,720
Well, I want to know what happens if you don't pay that.

583
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:21,520
'Cause like...

584
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:22,720
Surely they're just like...

585
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:23,220
What's happening?

586
00:28:23,220 --> 00:28:25,520
You need $25 million for the unit.

587
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:26,720
They're not gonna kick you out.

588
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:27,420
Well, that's what I'm saying.

589
00:28:27,420 --> 00:28:29,620
They'll probably just fine you or some shit.

590
00:28:29,620 --> 00:28:32,820
Like, what can a homeowners association do to you?

591
00:28:32,820 --> 00:28:33,820
If you don't pay them?

592
00:28:33,820 --> 00:28:34,520
Dude...

593
00:28:34,520 --> 00:28:36,620
In the...

594
00:28:36,620 --> 00:28:39,620
In the southeast of the United States...

595
00:28:39,620 --> 00:28:41,120
They can do a lot.

596
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:42,520
Like what?

597
00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:43,520
They can do a lot.

598
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:44,320
What can they do?

599
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:45,220
They...

600
00:28:45,220 --> 00:28:47,820
Can basically not mow your lawn.

601
00:28:47,820 --> 00:28:49,720
Well, that's what I'm saying.

602
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:52,200
It's a New York City apartment.

603
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:52,700
You have--

604
00:28:52,700 --> 00:28:53,880
You can get lawn.

605
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:56,120
And they can put-- sometimes as a prank,

606
00:28:56,120 --> 00:28:57,880
they'll put a bunch of forks in your lawn.

607
00:28:57,880 --> 00:28:59,960
It happened to my old pastor.

608
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:01,560
That's funny.

609
00:29:01,560 --> 00:29:03,400
Yeah, they forked his lawn.

610
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:04,360
I think I would take--

611
00:29:04,360 --> 00:29:05,760
Genev Capusta, that was his--

612
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:09,720
--a nasty forked lawn over $5,000 a month.

613
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:12,680
Literally $60,000 a year.

614
00:29:12,680 --> 00:29:13,880
I think I would take--

615
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:15,840
probably most pranks.

616
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:16,840
I think I agree.

617
00:29:16,840 --> 00:29:18,280
Maybe they don't wash your window.

618
00:29:18,280 --> 00:29:21,640
I would let someone scare me in the elevator every time.

619
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:23,320
With like a mask.

620
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:29,440
I think a more like real scenario is that they just like fine you or like say that you're

621
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:33,420
in debt to them so like when your next payment rolls around they're like well you can pay

622
00:29:33,420 --> 00:29:36,520
this but you have to like pay whatever you owe beforehand.

623
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:40,660
What I would say is I'm not even gonna pay my fucking rent if you're gonna charge me

624
00:29:40,660 --> 00:29:41,660
this extra stuff.

625
00:29:41,660 --> 00:29:42,660
Yeah that's ridiculous.

626
00:29:42,660 --> 00:29:48,120
What can a homeowner's association actually do?

627
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:49,120
I don't know.

628
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:50,120
I don't know.

629
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:54,200
Yeah, well, it is a contract that you sign when you get in, so I guess they could have,

630
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:57,040
but they're not, maybe they will at a giant skyscraper, but.

631
00:29:57,040 --> 00:30:01,320
Yeah, they pull up my contract and I've signed it as like Poop Williams.

632
00:30:01,320 --> 00:30:04,320
Exactly, because you already paid the deposit.

633
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:07,600
They're like, I don't care what he fucking signs.

634
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:08,600
Mr. Poop, you can't.

635
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:11,120
Mr. Poop Williams, we are suing you.

636
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:16,840
Well, that's unfortunate because my name is actually Poop Johnson.

637
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:18,840
You got the wrong guy, sister.

638
00:30:18,840 --> 00:30:19,840
Yeah.

639
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:20,840
Yeah, I think...

640
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:22,980
You go, you go.

641
00:30:22,980 --> 00:30:28,480
I think one day I will make an excellent addition to the neighborhood watch in a very, very

642
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:29,980
medium neighborhood.

643
00:30:29,980 --> 00:30:33,160
I think you pull out the...

644
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:34,160
What's their thing?

645
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:35,160
The yard?

646
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:37,380
That video you did for the yard where you were wearing the cop outfit?

647
00:30:37,380 --> 00:30:40,080
You just pull that out and start walking.

648
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:41,080
Walking Phil.

649
00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:44,400
He's, you know, like running at small children.

650
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:45,400
Yep.

651
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:47,400
and you're like, "Freeze!"

652
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:54,400
and

653
00:30:54,400 --> 00:31:08,840
not

654
00:31:08,840 --> 00:31:12,360
be like baring your teeth the hackles are up it's none of that he walks by people

655
00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:19,880
sometimes and he looks at them it goes whoo and I all they always say what the

656
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:29,680
fuck and I say sorry but we're Walgreens and he did his little noise he hummed

657
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:34,520
we'll say he hummed he's saying it this woman right and the Walgreens lady says

658
00:31:34,520 --> 00:31:36,920
DON'T GROWL AT PEOPLE! BEHAVE!

659
00:31:36,920 --> 00:31:38,820
and I said

660
00:31:38,820 --> 00:31:39,320
YO!

661
00:31:39,320 --> 00:31:42,520
what the fuck did you just say to my dog you fucking bitch?

662
00:31:42,520 --> 00:31:45,520
and then yeah yeah I did

663
00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:49,080
and then I yeah dude and then I started throwing shit at her cans of beans

664
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:53,020
exploding on her head made her look like she had diarrhea in her hair

665
00:31:53,020 --> 00:31:56,020
no I did nothing I bought a Red Bull from her

666
00:31:56,020 --> 00:31:59,520
yeah I completed my transaction

667
00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:03,880
I completed my transaction I didn't use the three dollars in credit that I have

668
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:26,840
of

669
00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:41,280
that

670
00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:51,040
dog growl at you? Exactly! It's worse because dogs don't have kind of souls

671
00:32:51,040 --> 00:33:03,040
and human brains Rex but... I think people just think that a dog grumbling at someone is

672
00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:08,320
just a precursor to a to a deathly attack. He's never attacked he's gotten he's

673
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:14,800
He's gotten up to people's necks but he can barely reach because he's very small.

674
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:16,760
I don't think he would bite anybody.

675
00:33:16,760 --> 00:33:17,760
I am kind of waiting.

676
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:18,760
For him to attack someone?

677
00:33:18,760 --> 00:33:25,000
I'm waiting until, I feel like once, he just turned two, and I feel like once he's like

678
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:33,960
three or four, either the rate or the likelihood of an attack either goes way down or way, way

679
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:34,960
up.

680
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:35,960
Right.

681
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:42,960
is

682
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:44,960
That is like it's really

683
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:51,780
The most like if you have to be a dog shit owner of a dog to have your dog attack

684
00:33:51,780 --> 00:33:53,920
You have to be an actual retard

685
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:59,640
Yeah, like have a dog that attacks, you know, he has started doing though as he started we go to the park

686
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:04,860
Take him off leash. This is prime attack time, by the way, and then he starts

687
00:34:04,860 --> 00:34:08,180
The train that goes right by the park. He just chases the train

688
00:34:08,180 --> 00:34:10,440
I think I talked about this last week and then tonight

689
00:34:10,680 --> 00:34:13,940
There were some people having maybe a first date style picnic

690
00:34:13,940 --> 00:34:19,000
And these poor bastards are right in the line of where the train where he would chase the train

691
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,560
And so the train starts coming

692
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:27,120
He's got the ball in his mouth and I'm saying Phil Phil drop the ball

693
00:34:27,120 --> 00:34:35,760
Anytime he looks at the transact leave it leave it leave it Phil Phil come here and

694
00:34:37,160 --> 00:34:39,160
that he starts just

695
00:34:39,160 --> 00:34:46,140
Beelining straight for these people and they jumped up and grabbed all their shit and they were like really scared that he was gonna eat them

696
00:34:46,140 --> 00:34:49,500
But then he ran right past him and I had to say and I was

697
00:34:49,500 --> 00:34:53,140
I was also a little bit convinced that he would eat them. So I had to be like

698
00:34:53,140 --> 00:34:59,160
It's just a train. It just likes a train, which is a crazy thing to yell 45 feet away

699
00:34:59,160 --> 00:35:02,400
Being a dog owner is such an embarrassing thing

700
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:06,280
public

701
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:09,080
Yeah

702
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:21,960
Yeah

703
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:28,960
the

704
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:30,520
stockilling

705
00:35:30,520 --> 00:35:33,520

706
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:35,320

707
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:39,160

708
00:35:39,160 --> 00:35:40,480

709
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:42,400
a very scary

710
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:43,760
rottweiler

711
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:44,820
mhm

712
00:35:44,820 --> 00:35:46,280
and this is a dog

713
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:47,920
that is known as a killer

714
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:49,040
yet animal

715
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:50,440
this is a

716
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:54,680
orca style animal that targets humans and kills them

717
00:35:54,680 --> 00:35:56,920
and i like rottweilers they have big heads

718
00:35:56,920 --> 00:36:00,500
but this guy's dog

719
00:36:00,500 --> 00:36:02,100
is going

720
00:36:02,100 --> 00:36:06,860
*roar* slobbering his eyes when dogs get really angry their eyes turn like

721
00:36:06,860 --> 00:36:08,460
completely black

722
00:36:08,460 --> 00:36:10,920
and this dog is freaking the fuck out

723
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:12,520
getting so mad

724
00:36:12,520 --> 00:36:14,360
baring his teeth

725
00:36:14,360 --> 00:36:17,320
growling right in this guy's face like snapping at him

726
00:36:17,320 --> 00:36:19,220
and this fucking guy

727
00:36:19,220 --> 00:36:21,380
instead of doing what i would do

728
00:36:21,380 --> 00:36:23,780
this dog this guy

729
00:36:23,780 --> 00:36:26,020
jumps on the dogs back and like

730
00:36:26,020 --> 00:36:28,100
holtz is paused down

731
00:36:28,100 --> 00:36:30,160
and starts talking shit to it

732
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:32,500
gets like literally right up in its ears like

733
00:36:32,500 --> 00:36:33,940
you're not the boss bitch

734
00:36:33,940 --> 00:36:36,500
on the fucking boss you don't have a job

735
00:36:36,500 --> 00:36:40,860
i have a job i make all the money and he talks like he talks like the dog

736
00:36:40,860 --> 00:36:42,100
understands what he's saying

737
00:36:42,100 --> 00:36:45,980
right and he and uh... all the captions are always like

738
00:36:45,980 --> 00:36:47,100
uh...

739
00:36:47,100 --> 00:36:50,620
these get a little crazy over here in the thomas household

740
00:36:50,620 --> 00:36:53,580
but as long as everyone knows who's really in charge

741
00:36:53,580 --> 00:36:54,980
we have a great time

742
00:36:54,980 --> 00:36:58,140
it's like this this is not a good situation

743
00:36:58,140 --> 00:37:02,440
that's uh... that's like the circus guide that got eaten by a tiger is like

744
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:06,340
one of the one of these days that those in turn around just by his head off

745
00:37:06,340 --> 00:37:07,740
this sigfried and roy

746
00:37:07,740 --> 00:37:08,840
yeah

747
00:37:08,840 --> 00:37:10,720
i think that you got maimed

748
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:12,220
and her adly

749
00:37:12,220 --> 00:37:14,800
but i do not believe he was digested

750
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:19,600
That also happened like that that uh, like the dog whisperer guy on TV

751
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:22,480
Caesar Milan. Yeah where he was like people

752
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:26,800
He just kind of got bit by a dog a million times

753
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:30,760
No, you do get just bit by a dog when you have dogs bite you

754
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:33,400
They don't as long as they don't

755
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:38,160
Bite your arm off then. I don't really care like that's the thing that kind of sucks

756
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:44,120
If a kid, if I'm walking by some fucking snot-nosed kid, and the kid decides to, literally what

757
00:37:44,120 --> 00:37:49,000
every little kid does when they see Phil, if they're like under three, they immediately

758
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:52,520
try to touch his dong or his asshole.

759
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:53,520
Every single time.

760
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:57,840
The two places where you should not be touching on the dog.

761
00:37:57,840 --> 00:38:02,760
And a couple of times they've touched his dick or touched his asshole, and he just goes

762
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:04,880
like, he like turns around and growls at them.

763
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:08,340
the thing is if my dog fucking bites this stupid little kid

764
00:38:08,340 --> 00:38:09,880
i have to kill him

765
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:13,320
i have to electric chair kill my dog legally

766
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:16,520
or not even if they don't press charges that's the polite thing to do

767
00:38:16,520 --> 00:38:18,260
unfortunately

768
00:38:18,260 --> 00:38:20,280
to get them tested yeah

769
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:23,980
all of my fucking uh... all of that my dog's entire life

770
00:38:23,980 --> 00:38:29,100
depends on whether or not uh... uh... two-year-old kid walking on the street

771
00:38:29,100 --> 00:38:32,280
is gonna try to kick his ass

772
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:35,480
that's what it depends a gamble every single day

773
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:38,800
and if you're having a dog in new york is especially

774
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:41,560
volatile because

775
00:38:41,560 --> 00:38:45,080
this is a word

776
00:38:45,080 --> 00:38:46,200
well i don't

777
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:49,160
especially volatile especially volatile

778
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:50,680
the dog might blow up

779
00:38:50,680 --> 00:38:53,640
the dog could have a max win

780
00:38:53,640 --> 00:38:57,800
of violence of violent outbursts max win guys i'm sorry to interrupt but i do have

781
00:38:57,800 --> 00:38:59,080
one more beer

782
00:38:59,080 --> 00:39:01,320
which is the zero gravity

783
00:39:01,320 --> 00:39:08,760
IPA and I'm guessing that I will make it probably an eighth through this because I just read that it is 9% you guys

784
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:16,960
This is bordering on wine territory, which was making me sleepy Christmas does not happen in on space

785
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:25,640
What the fuck did you just say what the fuck are you guys is not this guy's so fucked up off the Christmas beer

786
00:39:25,640 --> 00:39:27,640
He can barely even think you say

787
00:39:28,520 --> 00:39:31,000
Christmas is not happening on space?

788
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:32,440
Let's move on.

789
00:39:32,440 --> 00:39:35,160
What the fuck? Who are you talking to?

790
00:39:35,160 --> 00:39:36,200
Are you good, man?

791
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:38,200
I don't know why I said that.

792
00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:40,200
*laughter*

793
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:44,040
What conversation are you having inside of your head?

794
00:39:44,040 --> 00:39:44,840
*laughter*

795
00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:46,840
I didn't want you to say those words!

796
00:39:46,840 --> 00:39:48,840
Christmas is not happening on space.

797
00:39:48,840 --> 00:39:50,840
*laughter*

798
00:39:50,840 --> 00:39:52,840
I kinda- I think I see what you mean.

799
00:39:52,840 --> 00:39:54,840
You know what? I'm turning this around.

800
00:39:54,840 --> 00:39:58,280
Christmas is a fully Earth thing. It doesn't happen in space.

801
00:39:58,280 --> 00:40:01,000
I agree with myself. I've just thought about it for a second.

802
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:05,120
I mean, I think, I can't say if you're true or not, or if you're right or not, because

803
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:08,000
um, what you said the first time really made no sense.

804
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:11,880
You are so fucking...

805
00:40:11,880 --> 00:40:13,380
What happened?

806
00:40:13,380 --> 00:40:15,380
What happened in your brain?

807
00:40:15,380 --> 00:40:17,380
He moved, man. Just let him, let him live, man.

808
00:40:17,380 --> 00:40:21,180
You said, you say stupid things every fucking episode like that.

809
00:40:21,180 --> 00:40:23,180
I do not say...

810
00:40:23,180 --> 00:40:24,680
Not out of context.

811
00:40:24,680 --> 00:40:26,380
What did you say like a month ago?

812
00:40:26,380 --> 00:40:28,860
That was making us laugh so fucking hard.

813
00:40:28,860 --> 00:40:30,360
*laughter*

814
00:40:30,360 --> 00:40:32,360
I don't remember!

815
00:40:32,360 --> 00:40:35,360
Uh, uh, Julio? You seem to remember.

816
00:40:35,360 --> 00:40:40,360
The poutine is a fry-based meal or something like that.

817
00:40:40,360 --> 00:40:43,360
Poutine... it was some... oh fuck, what was it?

818
00:40:43,360 --> 00:40:48,360
It was poutine is a something meal. God damn it, it was funny.

819
00:40:48,360 --> 00:40:49,360
But, that's okay.

820
00:40:49,360 --> 00:40:52,360
I think maybe potato-based? Fry-based?

821
00:40:52,360 --> 00:40:54,360
I think either one of those, yeah.

822
00:40:54,360 --> 00:40:55,360
Yeah.

823
00:40:55,360 --> 00:41:00,560
But that makes sense. It's dumb but it makes sense in context.

824
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:04,760
This is the Christmas episode. This is coming out on Christmas.

825
00:41:04,760 --> 00:41:05,760
Is it?

826
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:07,760
Santa delivered a sentence into your mouth.

827
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:10,760
Oh wait no, it comes out today. I'm stupid.

828
00:41:10,760 --> 00:41:13,760
I just tricked you.

829
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:15,760
You did trick me, you fucking piece of shit.

830
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:16,760
I'm sorry.

831
00:41:16,760 --> 00:41:19,760
I forgot we were completely live and it goes out right after this.

832
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:24,760
Do you think if there was like settlements on Mars, they would still have Santa?

833
00:41:24,760 --> 00:41:31,760
the

834
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:35,340
well obviously if you're on mars is no god

835
00:41:35,340 --> 00:41:39,640
you can't get that would be a good set and you can be very few christians so

836
00:41:39,640 --> 00:41:40,640
it

837
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:44,120
because there's almost zero mention of mars in the bible

838
00:41:44,120 --> 00:41:49,480
yeah i think that anyway dot create mars on the pocket of those lakes well day

839
00:41:49,480 --> 00:41:51,680
theoretical expressive amounts i think

840
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:54,960
There's no way where people just don't go crazy after like a couple years

841
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:59,440
After a year. Yeah, I mean of course i'm meant to be on mars man

842
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:06,400
And also that they would fuck up the fucking oxygen levels ever so slightly where it would give people awful brain damage

843
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:12,800
Listen that I know i'm being scouted by tons of different companies. Listen to me and listen to me now

844
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:18,400
I'm not going to mars. I will not repopulate mars or populate it for the first time

845
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:24,480
Yeah, I'm being reached out to by thousands of fucking companies that want to send me to be the atom

846
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:31,840
Uh of the new mars settlement. I'm not gonna do it. Yeah. Well, they don't know how hair would react to living on mars

847
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:34,240
so they need to know that

848
00:42:34,240 --> 00:42:39,360
Everyone is going to be perfectly spheroid bald. It's actually not true, man

849
00:42:39,360 --> 00:42:41,920
It's you know, you know what the truth is

850
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:43,360
What's the truth?

851
00:42:43,360 --> 00:42:47,440
They picked aubrey plaza to be the eve and I was the only person that she would go with

852
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:50,480
That's right. Aubrey Plaza.

853
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:54,240
Aubrey Plaza. 41 year old Aubrey Plaza and me.

854
00:42:54,240 --> 00:42:56,240
Populating Mars all by ourselves.

855
00:42:56,240 --> 00:42:58,240
100 year old Aubrey Plaza.

856
00:42:58,240 --> 00:43:00,240
Having sex together.

857
00:43:00,240 --> 00:43:02,240
Then we have kids. The kids have sex.

858
00:43:02,240 --> 00:43:03,500
We're going old school.

859
00:43:03,500 --> 00:43:05,140
Those kids have sex with each other.

860
00:43:05,140 --> 00:43:07,140
On and on and on and on and on.

861
00:43:07,140 --> 00:43:10,340
That is the beautiful miracle of life.

862
00:43:10,340 --> 00:43:12,340
As told in the Bible.

863
00:43:12,340 --> 00:43:15,180
I feel like the Bible doesn't get enough shit for that.

864
00:43:15,180 --> 00:43:18,060
I think it just isn't a big deal.

865
00:43:18,060 --> 00:43:33,140
the

866
00:43:33,140 --> 00:43:40,140
you

867
00:43:40,140 --> 00:43:41,140
It's not a big deal.

868
00:43:41,140 --> 00:43:44,940
It's not a big deal until you do like nine times that.

869
00:43:44,940 --> 00:43:45,940
And then-

870
00:43:45,940 --> 00:43:48,460
What about those fucking guys that that guy made that video about?

871
00:43:48,460 --> 00:43:51,260
Where the guy just goes, "Duh!"

872
00:43:51,260 --> 00:43:53,260
You seen that?

873
00:43:53,260 --> 00:43:54,260
No.

874
00:43:54,260 --> 00:43:55,260
You haven't seen that?

875
00:43:55,260 --> 00:43:56,620
The most inbred family in America?

876
00:43:56,620 --> 00:43:57,620
Oh, no.

877
00:43:57,620 --> 00:44:00,340
You have to watch this video.

878
00:44:00,340 --> 00:44:02,900
This is the best video ever because I really like these people.

879
00:44:02,900 --> 00:44:07,060
I think that I- not even making fun of them, I think that they are good people.

880
00:44:07,060 --> 00:44:08,060
And the guy says-

881
00:44:08,060 --> 00:44:11,420
content that you like to watch on YouTube but I don't really watch that.

882
00:44:11,420 --> 00:44:18,580
Let's take a step back for a minute. The first guy to engage in that like

883
00:44:18,580 --> 00:44:24,900
incestuous you know the most inbred family incest family, was he a very smart

884
00:44:24,900 --> 00:44:37,420
guy? Yes he knew that his spawn would one day be YouTube stars. Right. Well then I

885
00:44:37,420 --> 00:44:39,420
I don't really see a problem with it.

886
00:44:39,420 --> 00:44:45,420
I wonder how that works.

887
00:44:45,420 --> 00:44:49,420
Which one of them gets to get the welfare?

888
00:44:49,420 --> 00:44:51,900
I think probably I

889
00:44:51,900 --> 00:44:58,220
That is the honestly I would if they had a patreon where they had a podcast and they just went

890
00:44:58,220 --> 00:45:03,300
Each other I would I would subscribe to that they could make a lot of money off me. I

891
00:45:03,300 --> 00:45:05,300
Would pay 10 bucks a month

892
00:45:05,300 --> 00:45:10,200
I'd be the one tier above the base tier to listen to that so that I can get video of it

893
00:45:10,200 --> 00:45:12,200
So you get the D&D episodes?

894
00:45:12,200 --> 00:45:12,700
I get the-

895
00:45:12,700 --> 00:45:16,200
*laughter*

896
00:45:16,200 --> 00:45:18,200
Get the D&D episodes!

897
00:45:18,200 --> 00:45:22,200
The D&D episodes, they roll a one-sided die.

898
00:45:22,200 --> 00:45:24,200
I would listen to that.

899
00:45:24,200 --> 00:45:26,200
They're doing coin flips on everything.

900
00:45:26,200 --> 00:45:30,700
But yeah, I'm gonna have to disagree with you there, Rex.

901
00:45:30,700 --> 00:45:33,700
I do think that inbreeding and incest is pretty bad.

902
00:45:33,700 --> 00:45:37,700
It's not bad until you do it like four times.

903
00:45:38,700 --> 00:45:43,700
I think it's just a thing that the Bible just makes you assume that happened a long time ago,

904
00:45:43,700 --> 00:45:46,700
but at some point it got phased out of the...

905
00:45:46,700 --> 00:45:52,200
I think my wife found out a couple years ago that her great-great-grandparents were first cousins.

906
00:45:52,200 --> 00:45:56,200
It's just that it's not that big of a deal, man.

907
00:45:56,200 --> 00:45:59,200
People do that shit.

908
00:45:59,200 --> 00:46:02,700
I just wouldn't want to fuck my fucking cousin, man.

909
00:46:02,700 --> 00:46:04,700
Yeah, of course. That's nasty.

910
00:46:04,700 --> 00:46:05,700
She's ugly.

911
00:46:05,700 --> 00:46:07,200
Yeah, but she's hot.

912
00:46:07,200 --> 00:46:08,200
But you have to do it.

913
00:46:08,200 --> 00:46:12,800
Maybe if I had to do it I probably if I had to do anything. I would I've said that before

914
00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:21,700
If I had to do anything I would do it if I absolutely had to have to walk two blocks to buy a beer

915
00:46:21,700 --> 00:46:23,240
Would you do that?

916
00:46:23,240 --> 00:46:25,240
You know I did last night man

917
00:46:25,240 --> 00:46:32,360
I knew because he was rolling around 11 p.m. I knew that time was ticking down man

918
00:46:32,360 --> 00:46:37,160
We're trying to get one more game of Valoran in okay, and I

919
00:46:37,160 --> 00:46:41,240
I saw my opportunity.

920
00:46:41,240 --> 00:46:44,440
Mike had to go piss or something for a minute.

921
00:46:44,440 --> 00:46:49,640
So I did my duty and I walked out.

922
00:46:49,640 --> 00:46:51,760
I told my wife I'm going to go grab a beer real quick.

923
00:46:51,760 --> 00:46:54,040
She said, "Okay, don't play another game.

924
00:46:54,040 --> 00:46:56,400
I'm trying to go to bed soon."

925
00:46:56,400 --> 00:46:58,360
I said, "Don't even worry about it.

926
00:46:58,360 --> 00:46:59,360
I got you."

927
00:46:59,360 --> 00:47:01,040
I opened my front door.

928
00:47:01,040 --> 00:47:04,960
I basically fall down the stairs, sprint two blocks.

929
00:47:04,960 --> 00:47:12,320
I get a beer, a two block away beer, I got this beer in under three minutes.

930
00:47:12,320 --> 00:47:13,800
Which was an amazing feat.

931
00:47:13,800 --> 00:47:14,800
That's really impressive.

932
00:47:14,800 --> 00:47:22,800
I, uh, during a TFT game, I suddenly had the urge to poop.

933
00:47:22,800 --> 00:47:30,480
And I waited at, basically, I took a poop, wiped, washed my hands, came back to my desk

934
00:47:30,480 --> 00:47:32,040
in one round.

935
00:47:32,040 --> 00:47:33,040
Wow!

936
00:47:33,040 --> 00:47:40,320
I'm gonna say this is this is impressive, but I don't think it's it's that comparable to kill thing because

937
00:47:40,320 --> 00:47:43,560
Tfd is a game that you can just if you're playing on the computer

938
00:47:43,560 --> 00:47:46,260
You can just get your phone and you can just play it could have played it on your phone

939
00:47:46,260 --> 00:47:48,260
Yeah, you could have played it on your phone

940
00:47:48,260 --> 00:47:55,760
It that seems like a big oversight for you one second it will take less than around to do to install it and login

941
00:47:55,760 --> 00:48:01,600
Well, I didn't I realized that while I was on the toilet, but I was thinking more about

942
00:48:02,480 --> 00:48:04,480
pooping as fast as possible and

943
00:48:04,480 --> 00:48:08,740
Playing my ass with water wiping washing my hands and running back

944
00:48:08,740 --> 00:48:14,040
Do you have a bidet on every single toilet in your apartment at this point?

945
00:48:14,040 --> 00:48:18,820
There is two toilets and I only use one of them. There's no toilet in the whole apartment

946
00:48:18,820 --> 00:48:24,400
Well, there's three but there's two that are really usable. There's one in the basement. That's just a

947
00:48:24,400 --> 00:48:30,160
I feel like two two if it for a three-bedroom two toilets is completely normal. Yeah

948
00:48:31,280 --> 00:48:39,640
apartment what yeah how we never know how insane Rex's apartment is I know that

949
00:48:39,640 --> 00:48:42,560
nobody lives on the bottom floor which is very odd to me

950
00:48:42,560 --> 00:48:46,040
no someone does live on the bottom floor oh I thought all of you were upstairs

951
00:48:46,040 --> 00:48:52,480
mm-hmm why do you have six bedrooms that's a really really tiny oh wait

952
00:48:52,480 --> 00:48:57,320
this is an office right right yeah okay now I remember and every room is the

953
00:48:57,320 --> 00:49:02,240
same size as this basically. Yeah it's like I mean you can't see the whole room

954
00:49:02,240 --> 00:49:07,440
in my webcam. It's really funny how. There's one wall, there's one wall,

955
00:49:07,440 --> 00:49:11,840
there's the other, there's the back wall, my desk is up against the wall, it's

956
00:49:11,840 --> 00:49:17,560
literally a cube. Yeah. It's not very comfortable. It's really funny to me how

957
00:49:17,560 --> 00:49:24,680
Rex leveled up from living and sleeping in a hallway for a year and

958
00:49:24,680 --> 00:49:28,360
And now he just lives in an apartment that's entirely a hallway.

959
00:49:28,360 --> 00:49:30,360
[laughter]

960
00:49:30,360 --> 00:49:33,960
That is a level up. You did live in a hallway.

961
00:49:33,960 --> 00:49:38,280
You lived in a hallway of a castle, which was a very odd combination.

962
00:49:38,280 --> 00:49:40,600
It was. The place was awesome.

963
00:49:40,600 --> 00:49:43,480
I kind of miss it, but not really.

964
00:49:43,480 --> 00:49:45,640
Fond memories of the doorbell, for sure.

965
00:49:45,640 --> 00:49:50,760
The doorbell, the view of the water, nothing else.

966
00:49:50,760 --> 00:49:52,760
You always oversell this view.

967
00:49:52,760 --> 00:49:54,760
I thought it was a great view.

968
00:49:54,760 --> 00:49:56,760
I would say that the view was nice.

969
00:49:56,760 --> 00:50:02,760
It was a window where you could see between two buildings this much water.

970
00:50:02,760 --> 00:50:07,760
That is enough water. I'm sorry, how much water can you see from your window?

971
00:50:07,760 --> 00:50:11,760
Zero! But I don't claim to have a view, piece of shit asshole!

972
00:50:11,760 --> 00:50:16,760
Wait, well you've been stuck in this prison for what, like five years now?

973
00:50:16,760 --> 00:50:20,760
I've been in this apartment for three and a half years, yeah.

974
00:50:20,760 --> 00:50:25,240
years. Yeah. So at this point you're like the sensitize of what people like to look at

975
00:50:25,240 --> 00:50:28,240
out of their windows because you look out your window, you see a naked guy.

976
00:50:28,240 --> 00:50:34,120
I like looking at my parking lot. I like the parking lot. If you want to look at water,

977
00:50:34,120 --> 00:50:37,600
buddy, nobody's going to stop you from going to the bathtub and putting your head underwater

978
00:50:37,600 --> 00:50:42,160
until you can't fucking think anymore. Go ahead. If you need to relax so bad.

979
00:50:42,160 --> 00:50:46,640
Do you have a bathtub? You have a bathtub, right? I kind of forgot. I just remembered

980
00:50:46,640 --> 00:50:48,120
that I- I do have a bathtub.

981
00:50:48,120 --> 00:50:53,580
No, I was talking Rex I guess I took I remember taking a shower there and almost flipping like every single time

982
00:50:53,580 --> 00:50:56,120
Yeah, I almost slip every time I take a shower

983
00:50:56,120 --> 00:51:00,560
I am a bat. I take a bath almost every single day you guys

984
00:51:00,560 --> 00:51:03,380
This is how I decompress at the end of my very long days

985
00:51:03,380 --> 00:51:09,220
You have a really, you know long schedule with a lot of things on it

986
00:51:09,220 --> 00:51:12,160
Recently, it's true. I

987
00:51:12,840 --> 00:51:19,720
Go in the bathtub at the end of the day and I watch my balls float up to the surface of the water and this is

988
00:51:19,720 --> 00:51:22,560
Literally the most meditative thing imaginable

989
00:51:22,560 --> 00:51:30,080
You have not lived until you've seen the buoyancy of your own balls. That is true. And they are buoyant

990
00:51:30,080 --> 00:51:36,600
There's air in there man. Yeah, somebody's got to get to the bottom of this. Why are my balls floating up?

991
00:51:36,600 --> 00:51:42,040
You should just inflate them. Yeah, I do inflate them with helium

992
00:51:42,040 --> 00:51:55,920
and

993
00:51:55,920 --> 00:51:59,920
We keep drowning us!

994
00:51:59,920 --> 00:52:04,920
No, I don't drown them. I suffocate them in a shirt.

995
00:52:04,920 --> 00:52:06,920
In a shirt?

996
00:52:06,920 --> 00:52:07,920
Completely normal.

997
00:52:07,920 --> 00:52:08,920
In a shirt?

998
00:52:08,920 --> 00:52:11,920
Yeah. Yeah, I suffocate my jizz in a shirt.

999
00:52:11,920 --> 00:52:13,920
Ah, I see.

1000
00:52:13,920 --> 00:52:16,920
Well, it's already dirty, I would hope.

1001
00:52:16,920 --> 00:52:21,920
Yeah, of course it's dirty. I already used it to jizz into like 45 times.

1002
00:52:21,920 --> 00:52:26,920
Hey, this is a shirt you wear every day?

1003
00:52:26,920 --> 00:52:28,920
I wore it to the gym one time on accident.

1004
00:52:28,920 --> 00:52:30,920
*laughs*

1005
00:52:30,920 --> 00:52:32,920
Oh, dude, come on.

1006
00:52:32,920 --> 00:52:34,920
What?

1007
00:52:34,920 --> 00:52:38,920
You're lying right now. You did not wear the cum shirt to the gym.

1008
00:52:38,920 --> 00:52:40,920
Not THE cum shirt. A cum shirt.

1009
00:52:40,920 --> 00:52:44,920
Well, why aren't you only using one shirt?

1010
00:52:44,920 --> 00:52:46,920
I'm not, dude. I have a whole rotation.

1011
00:52:46,920 --> 00:52:48,920
Why? Use one shirt.

1012
00:52:48,920 --> 00:52:52,920
Use- oh, that'd be disgusting. It'd get so covered in jizz.

1013
00:52:52,920 --> 00:52:54,920
*laughs*

1014
00:52:54,920 --> 00:52:55,920
What man?

1015
00:52:55,920 --> 00:52:56,920
Are you guys being so fucking weird at this?

1016
00:52:56,920 --> 00:52:57,920
You've had an entire cum class in?

1017
00:52:57,920 --> 00:53:09,400
Yeah, I fucking, I open my door, I shoot one into the pocket, I'm still a guy who wears

1018
00:53:09,400 --> 00:53:14,760
t-shirts with pockets on the front, I shoot one into the pocket and then I fucking go

1019
00:53:14,760 --> 00:53:17,080
to the bathroom and take a shit.

1020
00:53:17,080 --> 00:53:19,280
Do that every morning.

1021
00:53:19,280 --> 00:53:23,800
Morning shit, a little coffee, jizz in the shirt, go take a shit.

1022
00:53:23,800 --> 00:53:29,160
Is it like a shoot or is it like a kind of like an empty into type deal?

1023
00:53:29,160 --> 00:53:36,520
Are you saying does it have enough, I would say that my cum is very low PSI.

1024
00:53:36,520 --> 00:53:40,840
I would say that it almost comes out kind of like lava flow.

1025
00:53:40,840 --> 00:53:41,840
Right.

1026
00:53:41,840 --> 00:53:45,760
It just yeah, just kind of dribbling pieces of debris flying.

1027
00:53:45,760 --> 00:53:46,760
Yeah.

1028
00:53:46,760 --> 00:53:51,960
So the third is like, you know, like an inch away, you would say.

1029
00:53:51,960 --> 00:53:53,960
are you cutting a wedding of celery?

1030
00:53:53,960 --> 00:53:55,960
I probably couldn't make it an inch.

1031
00:53:55,960 --> 00:53:57,960
I'm just holding it over it.

1032
00:53:57,960 --> 00:53:59,960
At sort of an angle.

1033
00:53:59,960 --> 00:54:01,960
So that it kind of fills in.

1034
00:54:01,960 --> 00:54:03,960
Kind of like you're tapping sap from a maple tree.

1035
00:54:03,960 --> 00:54:06,960
I don't want to get too personal here, but how long is the rotation?

1036
00:54:06,960 --> 00:54:08,960
Of Jizz shirts?

1037
00:54:08,960 --> 00:54:09,960
Yeah.

1038
00:54:09,960 --> 00:54:11,960
I mean, let's see how many shirts do I have.

1039
00:54:11,960 --> 00:54:15,960
You don't jizz on every shirt do you have?

1040
00:54:15,960 --> 00:54:19,960
Guys, I was lying.

1041
00:54:19,960 --> 00:54:34,960
the

1042
00:54:34,960 --> 00:54:36,960
Does he use any paper?

1043
00:54:36,960 --> 00:54:40,000
Like, yeah, use a paper product. That's what it's for.

1044
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:42,000
No, it's not! They're abrasive!

1045
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:45,920
My shirts are amazing! Millions of cotton count thread counts.

1046
00:54:45,920 --> 00:54:47,920
Those are very comfortable on the skin.

1047
00:54:47,920 --> 00:54:51,440
Get some wipe...Jizz Wipes? They sell those?

1048
00:54:51,440 --> 00:54:53,440
A border wet wipe will do the trick.

1049
00:54:53,440 --> 00:54:55,440
The fragrance inflames my hand!

1050
00:54:55,440 --> 00:54:58,160
The what? What, the cum doesn't?

1051
00:54:58,160 --> 00:55:02,480
No, my cum is amazingly unfragrant. It's completely clear.

1052
00:55:02,480 --> 00:55:06,880
I have refused to believe that your cum isn't radioactive.

1053
00:55:06,880 --> 00:55:08,880
What do you mean?

1054
00:55:08,880 --> 00:55:12,880
I think if you left it on your skin it would fucking burn you alive.

1055
00:55:12,880 --> 00:55:15,280
You think I have corrosive caustic cum?

1056
00:55:15,280 --> 00:55:18,080
Yeah, I think most people do.

1057
00:55:18,080 --> 00:55:22,480
Yeah, yeah I think that's not too far off.

1058
00:55:22,480 --> 00:55:27,480
Because it's so fully saturated with sperm.

1059
00:55:27,480 --> 00:55:31,780
Well you don't drink any water.

1060
00:55:31,780 --> 00:55:36,580
I drink, I would say I drink more water than anybody I know and it's not even close.

1061
00:55:36,580 --> 00:55:38,740
How much water do you drink?

1062
00:55:38,740 --> 00:55:43,500
I probably drink at least a gallon and a half of water every single day.

1063
00:55:43,500 --> 00:55:46,340
That is a straight up lie.

1064
00:55:46,340 --> 00:55:48,740
You have no idea, you have no fucking idea.

1065
00:55:48,740 --> 00:55:50,900
I probably pee 20 times a day.

1066
00:55:50,900 --> 00:55:52,820
I mean I do that too, but that's not.

1067
00:55:52,820 --> 00:55:54,220
But you drink energy drinks.

1068
00:55:54,220 --> 00:55:57,660
I drink a crazy amount of water.

1069
00:55:57,660 --> 00:56:00,220
And I drink, you know, one of these.

1070
00:56:00,220 --> 00:56:01,220
A hydroflask.

1071
00:56:01,220 --> 00:56:08,220
one

1072
00:56:08,220 --> 00:56:20,660
the

1073
00:56:20,660 --> 00:56:23,600
and I drank about 16 ounces of water,

1074
00:56:23,600 --> 00:56:25,200
just chugged it two separate times.

1075
00:56:25,200 --> 00:56:27,360
- That's why you need a hydro,

1076
00:56:27,360 --> 00:56:29,220
so you don't have to get up.

1077
00:56:29,220 --> 00:56:31,440
- But I still have to, I still wake up though,

1078
00:56:31,440 --> 00:56:32,680
'cause I'm so thirsty.

1079
00:56:32,680 --> 00:56:34,320
- Yeah, but waking up's not a problem,

1080
00:56:34,320 --> 00:56:35,560
getting up is a problem.

1081
00:56:35,560 --> 00:56:36,600
(laughing)

1082
00:56:36,600 --> 00:56:37,760
- Waking up is a problem.

1083
00:56:37,760 --> 00:56:40,920
- I still wake up though, is the situation.

1084
00:56:40,920 --> 00:56:42,640
- I still wake up, I don't wanna wake up.

1085
00:56:42,640 --> 00:56:43,800
You can just, in the middle of the night,

1086
00:56:43,800 --> 00:56:44,720
go drink water.

1087
00:56:44,720 --> 00:56:46,240
- Yeah, but waking up in the middle of the night,

1088
00:56:46,240 --> 00:56:47,560
turning over, drinking a little bit,

1089
00:56:47,560 --> 00:56:49,280
going back to sleep, that's easy.

1090
00:56:49,280 --> 00:56:52,280
But I also, I cannot drink a little bit of water.

1091
00:56:52,280 --> 00:56:53,960
I cannot drink a sip of water.

1092
00:56:53,960 --> 00:56:55,880
I can only ever chug a glass of water.

1093
00:56:55,880 --> 00:56:59,440
So if I had a Hydro Flask, I would be drinking,

1094
00:56:59,440 --> 00:57:01,680
I'd be drinking 32 ounces of water

1095
00:57:01,680 --> 00:57:03,560
every single time I drink water, instantly.

1096
00:57:03,560 --> 00:57:05,760
I only ever chug water, I'm not kidding.

1097
00:57:05,760 --> 00:57:08,160
When I go to a, every waiter hates me

1098
00:57:08,160 --> 00:57:10,960
because I go to restaurants, they fill up my water glass

1099
00:57:10,960 --> 00:57:13,120
and then before they've left the table,

1100
00:57:13,120 --> 00:57:14,760
they fill up the last person's glass

1101
00:57:14,760 --> 00:57:15,840
and I already need a refill

1102
00:57:15,840 --> 00:57:17,840
because I just chug the entire thing in one sip.

1103
00:57:17,840 --> 00:57:21,280
Okay, get up and go get a glass of water and chug it in front of us right now.

1104
00:57:21,280 --> 00:57:23,120
Okay.

1105
00:57:23,120 --> 00:57:28,400
The gauntlet has been thrown down.

1106
00:57:28,400 --> 00:57:34,000
I hate him so much, he's just lying about everything in his life right now.

1107
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:37,920
I come in a t-shirt, I drink a gallon and a half of water.

1108
00:57:37,920 --> 00:57:40,640
I can't see every single t-shirt.

1109
00:57:40,640 --> 00:57:46,720
I'm sorry, first of all, if you drank that much water, your cum would be shooting because it is so light.

1110
00:57:46,720 --> 00:57:51,920
I know he can hear us right now, but I was thinking just now over the past like five minutes or

1111
00:57:51,920 --> 00:57:55,920
so that I would love to gift him a hydro flask as a Christmas present.

1112
00:57:55,920 --> 00:57:58,320
Okay, of course I was lying about the cum shirt.

1113
00:57:58,320 --> 00:58:00,520
I already said that you retard.

1114
00:58:00,520 --> 00:58:02,680
The water thing is completely true.

1115
00:58:02,680 --> 00:58:08,640
I'm sorry I'm doing a comedy podcast, not a fucking Native American research podcast.

1116
00:58:08,640 --> 00:58:12,200
I can't even drink this water.

1117
00:58:12,200 --> 00:58:13,200
No, this is void.

1118
00:58:13,200 --> 00:58:16,040
I can't tell how much water there is in the fucking rec...

1119
00:58:16,040 --> 00:58:18,040
This is so stupid.

1120
00:58:18,040 --> 00:58:19,040
This is so dumb.

1121
00:58:19,040 --> 00:58:20,040
It's literally falling down his throat.

1122
00:58:20,040 --> 00:58:23,040
I can't see how much water there is in there, man.

1123
00:58:23,040 --> 00:58:26,040
Okay, this is probably 24 ounces of water.

1124
00:58:26,040 --> 00:58:29,040
We did not drink that entire thing.

1125
00:58:29,040 --> 00:58:32,040
Literally filled it to the top and drank it right now.

1126
00:58:32,040 --> 00:58:36,040
Why didn't you show that before you did that?

1127
00:58:36,040 --> 00:58:37,040
You don't believe me?

1128
00:58:37,040 --> 00:58:38,040
No!

1129
00:58:38,040 --> 00:58:39,040
Why would you not believe me?

1130
00:58:39,040 --> 00:58:41,040
That's like no water.

1131
00:58:41,040 --> 00:58:43,040
Because you literally...

1132
00:58:43,040 --> 00:58:45,040
*gurgling*

1133
00:58:45,040 --> 00:58:46,040
Like you're a fucking-

1134
00:58:46,040 --> 00:58:48,040
I'm fucking chugged it, are you fucking brain dead?

1135
00:58:48,040 --> 00:58:50,040
*laughing*

1136
00:58:50,040 --> 00:58:51,040
Have you never seen any-

1137
00:58:51,040 --> 00:58:53,040
This is the biggest glass of water I own.

1138
00:58:53,040 --> 00:58:56,040
I go to the sink everyday and I drink this probably ten times.

1139
00:58:56,040 --> 00:59:01,040
You drank that like you're a Fortnite character drinking a chug jug.

1140
00:59:01,040 --> 00:59:05,040
Yeah, that's what I'm telling you Rex, is that I drink fast!

1141
00:59:05,040 --> 00:59:07,040
*laughing*

1142
00:59:07,040 --> 00:59:12,040
I swear on my mother's life, I filled this all the way to the top.

1143
00:59:12,040 --> 00:59:19,000
right to where the thread starts we can't do you have to run it back

1144
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:26,080
because that's a crazy thing to not believe as soon as I watch the replay

1145
00:59:26,080 --> 00:59:30,320
watch the replay as soon as I tipped it over here water started coming out you

1146
00:59:30,320 --> 00:59:38,000
can see it dribble down the side of my mouth I'm full

1147
00:59:38,760 --> 00:59:42,440
it's alright you drink a lot I got a water anyway you know what I actually

1148
00:59:42,440 --> 00:59:46,280
don't need to because I don't need to prove anything to you - if you don't want

1149
00:59:46,280 --> 00:59:50,720
to believe me that's on you but I want you to know of course I lied about the

1150
00:59:50,720 --> 00:59:56,840
cum shirt thing I was being funny the water thing is completely true a hundred

1151
00:59:56,840 --> 01:00:07,040
percent true realize realize realize that's very good again you know comedy

1152
01:00:07,040 --> 01:00:11,900
Podcast you got to be funny. That was very very funny Rex. You have the water hoodie as well. Wait, but he's

1153
01:00:11,900 --> 01:00:15,040
Ready, I have a water

1154
01:00:15,040 --> 01:00:18,840
It's the truth man, I've changed my

1155
01:00:18,840 --> 01:00:24,940
It's the fucking truth. I drink an absurd amount of water. That's why I have that's why I don't like

1156
01:00:24,940 --> 01:00:27,640
drinking beer at

1157
01:00:27,640 --> 01:00:30,080
restaurants because it's cheap

1158
01:00:30,080 --> 01:00:35,800
Right, and I will have and I never drink soda at restaurants because if I get a soda at a restaurant

1159
01:00:35,800 --> 01:00:41,120
I will have five sodas by the time I leave because I just chug every single thing that comes in front of my face

1160
01:00:41,120 --> 01:00:45,180
You know what? I do I don't take that in an odd manner. I do lemonade

1161
01:00:45,180 --> 01:00:48,680
lemonade

1162
01:00:48,680 --> 01:00:55,020
Places lemonade is a thousand calories of lemonade if I was drinking lemonade at a restaurant

1163
01:00:55,020 --> 01:00:58,760
I'll just look down asses and I'm I'm good

1164
01:00:58,760 --> 01:01:03,280
Can't do rather have a thousand glasses of beer thousand calories of beer

1165
01:01:03,920 --> 01:01:09,880
Exactly. I'm gonna do a thousand calories. I'll do it on beer every time and now I'm gonna have this miso soup

We may come back for a gamma session because we need to change something

1172
01:01:34,280 --> 01:01:38,040
Really change

1173
01:01:38,040 --> 01:01:40,420
We've been in a bad sorts. We have lost

1174
01:01:40,420 --> 01:01:47,400
$750 in the last two days. I wouldn't even say loss. I'd say we reversed one them

1175
01:01:47,400 --> 01:01:51,960
Yes, wait, we're you know hot streak like yes

1176
01:01:51,960 --> 01:01:56,560
$850 there is now a hundred dollars left

1177
01:01:56,900 --> 01:02:00,940
No doubt and the only thing that paid with the last $20 was

1178
01:02:00,940 --> 01:02:09,720
You know what that means you have to do one one thing just one bite and you back up big one

1179
01:02:09,720 --> 01:02:13,560
All right, goodbye beer drink
