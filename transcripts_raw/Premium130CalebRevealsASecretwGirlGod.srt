11
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:14,960
- Maybe we will give you that bulletproof vest.

12
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:17,300
- I think, here's the thing.

13
00:00:17,300 --> 00:00:19,840
Most of my clothes are airsoft proof.

14
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:20,680
- Yeah.

15
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:21,500
- You know?

16
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:22,840
- My skin is airsoft proof.

17
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:26,320
I've been hit by a number of BBs that I've gone through.

18
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:27,400
- They hurt pretty bad.

19
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:28,980
I can't believe kids do that.

20
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:32,820
it might really hurts my brother shot me with a airsoft shotgun in the ass when i

21
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:33,740
was like

22
00:00:33,740 --> 00:00:34,820
ten

23
00:00:34,820 --> 00:00:37,820
and uh... and you've never been the same no

24
00:00:37,820 --> 00:00:40,340
i really i really want to do it

25
00:00:40,340 --> 00:00:44,140
when i was in high school there's this like group of guys that like i i kind

26
00:00:44,140 --> 00:00:45,700
of hung out with but like

27
00:00:45,700 --> 00:00:49,660
we were like good friends and they would go play airsoft and never invite me and i

28
00:00:49,660 --> 00:00:52,100
remember being like i really really want to go

29
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:54,100
i feel like so like left out

30
00:00:54,100 --> 00:00:58,420
but like i'm glad i didn't go because it would have been like one faggot and then

31
00:00:58,420 --> 00:01:00,420
I would have gotten destroyed.

32
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:02,420
Like a wolf.

33
00:01:02,420 --> 00:01:04,420
Yeah, exactly.

34
00:01:04,420 --> 00:01:06,420
They were just like being kind

35
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:08,420
and being like we can't let you come

36
00:01:08,420 --> 00:01:10,420
because if we do we're going to fucking kill you.

37
00:01:10,420 --> 00:01:12,420
You know what's funny is that

38
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:14,420
Airsoft, like my brother

39
00:01:14,420 --> 00:01:16,420
is like, he runs a paintball field

40
00:01:16,420 --> 00:01:18,420
and I grew up playing paintball and stuff.

41
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:20,420
To paintball guys, Airsoft is the gayest

42
00:01:20,420 --> 00:01:22,420
thing you can do.

43
00:01:22,420 --> 00:01:24,420
That's so funny.

44
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:26,420
They hate Airsoft.

45
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:30,180
the case because I always thought airsoft was more because you it's because you're

46
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:34,180
pretending to be like in the military instead of just like like paintballs

47
00:01:34,180 --> 00:01:37,260
about like it might as well be like basketball you know they think it's like

48
00:01:37,260 --> 00:01:42,780
a sport but airsoft those guys like are serious they're like LARPing hard. You know what's so sick is the

49
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:49,620
the airsoft POV videos where it's like like it's like 18 year olds playing with

50
00:01:49,620 --> 00:01:54,180
like 12 year olds and they're like fighting each other over like like call

51
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:55,180
Call your fucking hits!

52
00:01:55,180 --> 00:01:56,180
Yeah.

53
00:01:56,180 --> 00:01:57,180
Call your hits!

54
00:01:57,180 --> 00:02:01,860
And the guy who makes the videos, he'll add like a hood, like it's Call of Duty.

55
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:03,860
He'll add like a chair in the middle.

56
00:02:03,860 --> 00:02:04,860
It's so fucking cool.

57
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:05,860
Oh my god.

58
00:02:05,860 --> 00:02:06,860
Our cable's broken.

59
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:07,860
You can't hear a single thing I'm saying?

60
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:08,860
It's just messed up here.

61
00:02:08,860 --> 00:02:09,860
Just take this.

62
00:02:09,860 --> 00:02:10,860
Okay.

63
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:11,860
We're doing, we're changing it out live?

64
00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:12,860
Does that work?

65
00:02:12,860 --> 00:02:13,860
Talk?

66
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:14,860
Hello?

67
00:02:14,860 --> 00:02:15,860
Is your, no, it doesn't work at all now.

68
00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:16,860
Did you turn the mic off?

69
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:17,860
No.

70
00:02:17,860 --> 00:02:18,860
Oh my god.

71
00:02:18,860 --> 00:02:19,860
Oh, I'm so sorry.

72
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:20,860
I'm so sorry.

73
00:02:20,860 --> 00:02:21,860
I'm so sorry.

74
00:02:21,860 --> 00:02:22,860
I'm so sorry.

75
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:23,860
I'm so sorry.

76
00:02:23,860 --> 00:02:24,860
Awesome.

77
00:02:24,860 --> 00:02:25,860
Oh, I love this.

78
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:26,860
I love our podcast.

79
00:02:26,860 --> 00:02:28,860
Okay, that's the worst cable.

80
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:29,860
Oh my God.

81
00:02:29,860 --> 00:02:30,860
Okay, hold on.

82
00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:31,860
Oh no.

83
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:32,860
I'm going to pause it.

84
00:02:32,860 --> 00:02:33,860
Okay, we're back.

85
00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:34,860
Sorry.

86
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:35,860
If you put your phone near the cables, it stops working.

87
00:02:35,860 --> 00:02:36,860
I don't know how it works, but we've discovered this.

88
00:02:36,860 --> 00:02:37,860
If the phone gets near the cable.

89
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:38,860
Have you guys heard about the new iPhone?

90
00:02:38,860 --> 00:02:39,860
It has a podcast mode settings.

91
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:40,860
When you're podcasting, you put it in podcast mode and then it won't mess with the cables.

92
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:41,860
Really?

93
00:02:41,860 --> 00:02:42,860
Yeah, really.

94
00:02:42,860 --> 00:02:43,860
Oh my God.

95
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:44,860
I don't know.

96
00:02:44,860 --> 00:02:45,860
I think mine gives the most interference.

97
00:02:45,860 --> 00:02:46,860
I think mine gives the most interference.

98
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:47,860
I think mine gives the most interference.

99
00:02:47,860 --> 00:02:48,860
I think mine gives the most interference.

100
00:02:48,860 --> 00:02:50,340
really yeah really

101
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:51,340
that's all

102
00:02:51,340 --> 00:02:52,340
oh my god

103
00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:54,840
no i think mine gives the most interference

104
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:56,620
no i think mine gives the most

105
00:02:56,620 --> 00:02:57,620
mine has flatburden

106
00:02:57,620 --> 00:02:58,620
mine's better it gives more

107
00:02:58,620 --> 00:03:01,680
my phone's more powerful so it interferes harder

108
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:02,680
wow

109
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:06,260

black shirt. He's like we wanted to make a job. We wanted to make

120
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:44,760

00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:48,460
watched an entire presentation?

123
00:03:48,460 --> 00:03:52,260
- My mom is like an acolyte for Apple.

124
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:53,720
Where like I grew up and we watched it

125
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:55,980
like it was the ball dropping on New Year's Eve.

126
00:03:55,980 --> 00:03:56,820
- Oh, really?

127
00:03:56,820 --> 00:03:57,660
- Yeah, yeah.

128
00:03:57,660 --> 00:04:00,980
Which is weird, 'cause like we didn't own almost anything.

129
00:04:00,980 --> 00:04:02,920
She had like one laptop.

130
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:03,760
And she was just--

131
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:04,740
- That must have changed your damn life.

132
00:04:04,740 --> 00:04:06,300
- I think it really did, yeah.

133
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:09,100
'Cause she's so like technologically illiterate

134
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:10,820
that there was finally like a computer she could use.

135
00:04:10,820 --> 00:04:11,980
It's basically a jitterbug.

136
00:04:11,980 --> 00:04:13,740
It's like a, like kinda.

137
00:04:13,740 --> 00:04:16,940
It's like a phone almost with five buttons on it.

138
00:04:16,940 --> 00:04:18,540
- I love my Jitterbug though.

139
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:19,660
- Jitterbug rocks.

140
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:22,740
We're here with the girl god, Grace and April.

180
00:06:56,500 --> 00:07:04,860
he's a billionaire. His parents must be billionaires. My job is to direct one movie. That's my job.

181
00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:09,660
100%. Just got hired to direct one movie. So what led to him using your head like a

182
00:07:09,660 --> 00:07:16,380
speed bag? So I'm like the kind of person, April and I were talking about when a guy

183
00:07:16,380 --> 00:07:21,260
is being an asshole at a bar, there's like the school of mind that April adopts which

184
00:07:21,260 --> 00:07:25,860
is to kind of just like who cares. Yeah. Or I mean like, I mean yeah you care because

185
00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:32,140
he's being an asshole. And then mine is like, I just don't want to slide. I'll go up to them

186
00:07:32,140 --> 00:07:37,460
and I'll be like, "Fuck you." So basically what happened is when he didn't want the celeb

187
00:07:37,460 --> 00:07:42,060
shot to happen, I was like, "You're a little bitch. Why are you acting like a little bitch?

188
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:49,060
Fucking calm down. This is pool. Let's have fun." And I roasted him a little bit and I

189
00:07:50,980 --> 00:07:59,680
called him like an assistant scout leader and really angered him to a point and

190
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:04,840
then at the end of the game he walked up to like shake my hand and I didn't shake

191
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:09,640
his hand and he got really really really offended by that. Well that's the honor of the game.

192
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:23,280
of the game that's why I do want to cop to that and apologize to that and I'm

193
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:26,520
learning and I'm growing he's posting pictures of you on Instagram like this

194
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:32,480
one does not shake my hand anybody knows her name

195
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:41,260
He this this continues he like he's like just kind of like getting like progressively way way way drunker

196
00:08:41,260 --> 00:08:45,360
He was walking around like I wasn't drinking, but he was like fucking yeah

197
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:48,820
You know and I go up to the bar to close out my tab

198
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:54,880
and I had just like lost the last game of pool that we were playing and he and

199
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:58,840
And it was like it was a dumb shot where like I was like

200
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:03,760
Trying I was trying to get the eight ball in and I I scratched and totally missed the eight ball

201
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:10,080
You know, it was like a really bad shot up in there when that happened. We all just laughed and stuff. Mm-hmm, but he walks up like

202
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:16,320
Two people down from me. So there's like one guy in between us and he loudly says

203
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:20,680
Well, I guess karma always gets you in the end

204
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:35,640
Actually, like what I I cared about losing that game because again like I guess it is mine

205
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:39,520
Every game of fool is like Yu-Gi-Oh level

206
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:47,180
He says that and then I look over at him and I'm like

207
00:09:47,180 --> 00:09:50,800
And I was a little drunk so I was kind of being like a bitch

208
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:55,320
But I was like, what do you do for a living? Like are you happy with your life?

209
00:09:55,320 --> 00:10:00,240
I'm like I'm happy with my life. I said I said I write for Rick and Morty

210
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:21,800
Yeah, I was like I was I just fucking was like I started listing off things that are good about my life

211
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:29,280
Basically, I was like, you look like you work in tech and hate your life and have a bunch

212
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:32,780
of exes that hate you for good reasons.

213
00:10:32,780 --> 00:10:39,560
And he walked over and just got like in my face in my face, like was like, like spit

214
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:42,040
coming off of me just yelling at me.

215
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:47,480
I was like, dude, please just like, stop this.

216
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:51,640
then he just fucking like slam me in the head a couple of times.

217
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:53,800
Whoa, right at the bar, right?

218
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:55,720
At the bar, right in front of the bartender.

219
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:56,840
Did they kick him out or anything?

220
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:59,960
No, they, I had to like walk him out.

221
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:03,800
Like I got in between them and was like, all right, it's time to go.

222
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:05,400
It's, it's time for you to leave.

223
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:07,880
And he was like, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.

224
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:12,280
And then he left and then his, his friends followed him out.

225
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:17,240
And then I think the, one of the funniest parts to me is afterwards his girlfriend was

226
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:23,000
was like came back in to close out his tab and she starts talking to me and she's and she's

227
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:28,380
like "Grace was making like all like I know he punched he punched her but Grace is making

228
00:11:28,380 --> 00:11:33,000
all these assumptions like that he's like straight like he's not straight"

229
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
*laughter*

230
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:42,200
I was like oh oh yeah that's the biggest takeaway from this.

231
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:44,400
Some guys sucked him off one time

232
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:47,520
Any trans woman he wants I know

233
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:51,720
It's legal to murder

234
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:59,120
Not real people

235
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:05,560
Yeah, sounds like a fun night

236
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:15,600
Something about pool really takes it out of people. It was also at Clara's. Do you remember that one?

237
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:16,600
That crazy woman.

238
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:23,000
Yeah, that woman was so mad about everything. Something about that bar, people who play pool there are real psychos.

239
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Yeah.

240
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
It's cool.

241
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
It's cause the wings of them, something in them.

242
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:31,000
The wings, yeah. It's too good. Too much MSG in the wings. Makes you go crazy, dude.

243
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Biden's gotta regulate that out.

244
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Yeah.

245
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:39,600
There's stuff in our nation's buffalo wings. I'm not just that far from that.

246
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:40,600
But you never see...

247
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:41,600
That's ruining our men.

248
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:42,600
What is it?

249
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:43,600
It's making men go crazy.

250
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:44,600
Wings are ruining masculinity.

251
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:50,240
There's not like a practical difference between like playing pool at a bar and playing like

252
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:52,000
ski ball at Dave and Buster's.

253
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Right.

254
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
But something about, you never see...

255
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
It's the sticks.

256
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
It might be the sticks.

257
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
That's true.

258
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
That's the difference.

259
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
You're holding a weapon.

260
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,600
It makes men, it's like brings out a certain kind of masculinity.

261
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:02,600
Yeah, it's like you're holding a phallic weapon.

262
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:03,600
It's a spear.

263
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:04,600
It's a caveman spear.

264
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:05,600
Yeah, right.

265
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:06,600
It speaks to a very primal urge.

266
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:10,640
urge. One of the big differences is that

267
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:13,560
skee-ball, who knows what the rules of

268
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:27,360
fucking skee-ball are. I know all the fucking rules. I play league. We can talk shit about pool all we want, but skee-ball we're not fucking talking shit about.

269
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:33,080
I bet you go for those little holes in the corner. Yeah the

270
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:39,600
thousand one. Oh my God, that's the dude. Fuck you man. What you're going to sit

271
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:43,000
there and use all it's about getting tickets. No, it's not to impress your

272
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:49,800
sweetheart. If you're not going for the tiny corner a thousand holes on

273
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:52,600
skeeball, you probably you probably shoot the cue ball with your hand.

274
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:58,440
Probably, you know what I should have known that he was going to be violent

275
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:00,600
because he was shooting the cue ball by punching.

276
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:05,960
I really think that he drew your face on the cupid.

277
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:09,320
He's using a sharpie and lipstick to draw.

278
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:10,320
I don't know if you can do that.

279
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:12,120
He's like, bar rules, bar rules.

280
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:13,800
Faggot, play.

281
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:15,280
You got a ball in this game.

282
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:16,840
You can say faggot.

283
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:18,880
You think he's about to pull out a pool cube,

284
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:23,800
but then it's just a duffel bag that has Hulk hands in it.

285
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:27,120
He chalks them up.

286
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:29,280
Yeah, did he chalk his fist up before he punched you?

287
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:29,800
Yeah, he did.

288
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:30,680
He did, dramatically.

289
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:39,960
really long yeah I mean I noticed that people who are like that about pool

290
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:43,640
usually kind of suck at it yeah people who are good at pool they don't care

291
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:47,240
about like a free game they don't care about games have money on them yeah you

292
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:52,120
know yeah so he probably sucked yeah he wasn't killer I mean it which he was

293
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:56,040
like fine but like he definitely was acting like he was really good by that I

294
00:14:56,040 --> 00:15:02,160
I mean like when he was about to take a shot he would he would spend like two

295
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:07,480
minutes looking at every angle and being like I think I could do no no maybe this

296
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:16,560
you know he was like beautiful minded like five minutes calculating the angles

297
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:28,520
So I do have one question. Do you guys think if I was there it would have gone

298
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:39,120
completely different? I would have stopped it pretty much? I do. I kind of think

299
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:44,080
like if like a guy had been there, like a straight guy like one of

300
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:50,480
yourselves, it possibly would have. So it's our fault?

301
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:56,480
Considering going out last night. I'm too tired. If one of you guys had been there he would have been way too horny to even see it.

302
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:58,480
Yeah, he's gay.

303
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:00,480
He would have been busy sucking my dick and he wouldn't have even thought to punch you.

304
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:02,480
What's I'm done with this?

305
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:05,480
He was like hitting on April low-key too.

306
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:06,480
Really?

307
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:08,480
He was just what a guy.

308
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:09,480
What a guy.

309
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:12,480
You know what I think actually got him like really pissed?

310
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:18,480
Like the, like I didn't remember this until now but like legit I think the last thing I said before he punched me was

311
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:22,280
was and also you're hitting on April a bunch and that's weird and he was like

312
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:35,480
I'm not hitting on April. I'm 12! That's so weird of him. And then it got in my face a bunch and I just went like this and like I grazed his hat and he fucking touched me twice.

313
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:40,840
He was just looking for an excuse. A molecule of you touching him. He was gonna he's gonna wail.

314
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:45,440
And just fucking wailed me. But I didn't even like intentionally touch him or

315
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:49,740
anything. Yeah, yeah. But you should have. Yeah, you should you should start

316
00:16:49,740 --> 00:16:54,900
wearing Wolverine claws. Yeah, yeah, yeah. You should get them installed.

317
00:16:54,900 --> 00:16:55,860
That's the surgery.

318
00:16:55,860 --> 00:17:04,180
My mom gave it to me. So it's a little embarrassing.

319
00:17:04,180 --> 00:17:08,860
Oh, wow. Yes, it's a it's a double barrel like

320
00:17:08,860 --> 00:17:12,740
it's a

321
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:14,060
love mom.

322
00:17:14,060 --> 00:17:20,660
on and now I want to buy a I wonder if you can you have just like a flintlock

323
00:17:20,660 --> 00:17:22,980
pistol yeah really I know

324
00:17:22,980 --> 00:17:28,900
what is the I feel like you could get away with when you see the well. I mean

325
00:17:28,900 --> 00:17:32,220
you see those pictures well, no, because you see those pictures like that, like

326
00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:35,660
like police departs. It's like office yeah off the street. It's like a

327
00:17:35,660 --> 00:17:41,380
homemade gun or like an antique store gun or something. If you show up to the

328
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:47,360
store like dressed up like a colonial soldier I think they are forced to sell

329
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:51,520
you that yeah I think it's like well it wouldn't make sense it's not a story of

330
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:57,240
a George Washington I feel like you could have though a laser gun yeah

331
00:17:57,240 --> 00:18:02,440
get two options you get blunderbuss or you get like the needler from Halo yeah

332
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:07,160
it's the only shit you could walk you could open carry a need you should be

333
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:10,600
able to have a musket without a license it's like you're not gonna like you got

334
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:24,080
a hundred guys you're never gonna be able to do a mass shooting with a musket I

335
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:27,640
don't know if this I think this is just a New England thing did they do this at

336
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:34,920
your school - they had a guy when I was in fourth grade they had a guy who was

337
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:39,520
like a like a colonial reenactor from like Sturbridge village or some shit and

338
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:43,440
and he came to our school in the parking lot just fired a bus.

339
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:49,120
Showed us how to load it and everything. He was like, and this is what they used to use

340
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:53,360
back in the day. And then he's like loading it and shit. And then he just shot it into the air.

341
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:57,920
They didn't do that at my school, but we went on a field trip to, uh,

342
00:18:57,920 --> 00:19:04,560
so we didn't have to, like, he could have just done this at stir bridge instead of like

343
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:12,200
little parking lot like why we saw a guy doing that on the beach in North

344
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:12,720
Carolina

345
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:17,840
for sure. Yeah, you don't remember get into the he's demonstrating the

346
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:21,300
musket yeah, he shot it into the air a couple of times. I would love to get a

347
00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:23,880
gun and shoot it into the air. Yeah, probably the coolest thing.

348
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:31,120
Especially if it's like a musket like if he's like yeah, you're shooting that

349
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:33,360
straight up in the you're aiming that up in the air and it's going directly

350
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:34,280
sideways. Yeah,

351
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:36,840
- I got it straight up into the air

352
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:39,600
and I killed someone 10 feet to my right.

353
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:43,600
- Do you think people ever shoot straight up in the air,

354
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:46,360
like hoping that it'll come back down and kill them,

355
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:48,260
but it'll look like a goofy accident?

356
00:19:48,260 --> 00:19:49,100
(laughing)

357
00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:51,880
So they're like, it won't look like a suicide,

358
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:54,200
their family will be like, oh, that's horrible.

359
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:57,000
What a dumb move, and not like, why did he do it?

360
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:57,840
(laughing)

361
00:19:57,840 --> 00:19:59,920
- Yeah, we'll always remember Yosemite Sam.

362
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:01,400
(laughing)

363
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:02,840
Loving father and brother.

364
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:04,840
(laughing)

365
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:06,040
that big trick shot. My God,

366
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:13,200
seventy Sam's kids are probably so annoying. Oh my God, imagine a class with

367
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:14,420

368
00:20:14,420 --> 00:20:20,600

He's like, just don't Google my dad.

374
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:34,800
- Yeah, thank you.

375
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:36,320
Thanks for being so cool.

376
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:38,680
Like, I knew you know.

377
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:41,300
- Know what you don't know.

378
00:20:41,300 --> 00:20:42,120
- I know what?

379
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:42,960
I know what?

380
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:43,880
(laughing)

381
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:44,720
- I mean, come on.

382
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:45,560
- You got like a big mustache.

383
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:46,380
(laughing)

384
00:20:46,380 --> 00:20:47,220
- Big red mustache.

385
00:20:47,220 --> 00:20:48,480
- Big red mustache.

386
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:50,200
I still don't get what you're saying.

387
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:52,440
(laughing)

388
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:58,480
- Cowboy hat, just any time, it's like,

389
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:00,020
"$50, what?"

390
00:21:00,020 --> 00:21:01,240
(laughing)

391
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:08,240
Okay, yeah, that's like a fun thing you do, but please, I'm not connecting the dots here.

392
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:09,240
[Laughter]

393
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:15,800
Dude, it's so sick whenever like a fucking like lawn company, like a lawn special, a lawn

394
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:20,920
care thing has like a fucking like just bootleg like Looney Tunes logo on it.

395
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:22,480
Well that's really common here.

396
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:25,200
There's no such thing as like copyright infringement in New York.

397
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:30,320
Yeah, like being Panther if you're like doing insulation, like Yosemite Sam for lawn care

398
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:33,880
for some reason. The ice cream trucks? Are you kidding me? Oh yeah. They'll have like,

399
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:47,940
they'll have Dora, SpongeBob, Dexter, and like Captain Marvel on one. The sickest one I ever saw was like a tikka

400
00:21:47,940 --> 00:21:53,920
kebab vendor in Niagara Falls that just had Lightning McQueen on it. That's so cool.

401
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:56,400
It just said "King of Tikka Kebab" and then it just...

402
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:57,600
Lightning Queen!

403
00:21:57,600 --> 00:22:00,400
Lightning Queen is the king of Tikka Kebab!

404
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:04,800
There's a place in North Carolina, my hometown, that they had to change their name.

405
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:06,640
It was a vape shop called Darth Vapor.

406
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:09,120
They got owned.

407
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:09,840
Darth Vapor!

408
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:12,880
They had Darth Vader was their logo, but he had smoke.

409
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:14,320
They flew too close to the sun.

410
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:14,480
Yeah.

411
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:17,520
They should have had some sort of caricature or something.

412
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:22,560
No, they went "Picture of Darth Vader" as their logo and they got in trouble.

413
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:32,200
and now they're called smoke cangs smoke cangs my friends in Chicago will took a

414
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:38,300
picture of a vape shop that was called smoking bad with the breaking bad

415
00:22:38,300 --> 00:22:46,800
I learned that there's like a it's like franchise like not franchise but there's

416
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:49,360
like multiple Zaza R Us locations.

417
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:50,760
- Zaza R Us, yeah.

418
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:51,600
- So cool.

419
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:53,160
- Like Zaza Gabor?

420
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:56,120
- No, I think Zaza means weed or something.

421
00:22:56,120 --> 00:22:58,160
- Like Toys R Us, I think is the play.

422
00:22:58,160 --> 00:22:59,400
- But for weed.

423
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:00,240
- What?

424
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:01,060
- I think it's probably tobacco.

425
00:23:01,060 --> 00:23:02,760
- What is it, do you ever see places,

426
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:04,700
there are places that have like Rick and Morty

427
00:23:04,700 --> 00:23:05,640
as their logo.

428
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:08,000
- Oh, everywhere you see that.

429
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:12,760
- There's like, there are, I feel like are weed places

430
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:15,840
that'll just have Rick and Morty like posters in there.

431
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:18,560
They won't even go as far as to put a logo or anything.

432
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:19,560
Just a poster, yeah.

433
00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:21,560
This is where you gotta go.

434
00:23:21,560 --> 00:23:22,560
There's a...

435
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:24,640
It's probably a sign of a good...

436
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:30,520
Noah Colvin's been taking pictures of every Rick and Morty weed thing he finds.

437
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:31,520
Yeah.

438
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:34,280
And he said he's probably up to like 500 pictures or something.

439
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:35,280
My God.

440
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:36,280
They're everywhere.

441
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:37,280
Like Rick and Morty bongs.

442
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:38,280
Yeah.

443
00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:39,280
They got the fucking pickle Rick bowl.

444
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:43,560
I've seen some truly terrifying Morty bowls where it'll be like his...

445
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:52,120
mouth is the hole oh and one of them there was glass teeth

446
00:23:52,120 --> 00:24:06,800
expensive weed stuff is so crazy yeah and it looked like shit are you saying it

447
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:10,560
would be a dumb idea to purchase one of those are you saying if someone had

448
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:12,560
purchase one of those it would be for my

449
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:20,680
Not telling I

450
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:24,680
Remember Joe who shares the office with us?

451
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:29,520
He like somebody gave him like a bunch of like like weed stuff for free

452
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:35,000
they like quit smoking and I gave him like all these insane like an insane bong and it's saying like bubbler and stuff and

453
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:39,760
and the bubbler that he got was like this crazy blown glass spaceship and he

454
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:41,720
handed it to me and he was like, check this out.

455
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:46,060
And I immediately just dropped it into a million pieces.

456
00:24:46,060 --> 00:24:49,920
And then he was real mad at me. Yeah. And I was just laughing.

457
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:52,600
I was like, it was free. And also who cares a fucking bubbler.

458
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:54,680
It might as well be an apple.

459
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:57,600
You might my ex had this like Smurf bowl.

460
00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:02,440
It's just like a piece of glass, just like shaped like a Smurf.

461
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:04,760
and then its butt was like the bowl.

462
00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:05,600
- Oh.

463
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:06,440
- Yeah, so you just-- - Oh, come on.

464
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:08,280
- Look at this damn Smurf's butt.

465
00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:09,120
- It's fucking disgusting.

466
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:09,940
- That's nasty.

467
00:25:09,940 --> 00:25:13,520
- But like the glass, like it looked enough like a Smurf,

468
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:17,660
but it was like if an AI tried to like create a Smurf,

469
00:25:17,660 --> 00:25:21,800
because like the eyes were like protruding off of its head,

470
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:24,600
and like its face just like it had no mouth or anything,

471
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:25,880
just like a big nose too,

472
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:28,000
and it's like you couldn't set it down anywhere.

473
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,280
- Doesn't sound like a Smurf at all.

474
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:30,720
- If you did, it would like immediately

475
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:32,240
like topple over like that.

476
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:33,760
It broke like immediately.

477
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:37,800
I love getting the toys where they got the colors wrong.

478
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:40,440
The figures where they painted the wrong color.

479
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:42,240
They like didn't paint the eyes or something.

480
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:43,160
Those are so cool.

481
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:43,720
Yeah.

482
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:44,260
Yeah.

483
00:25:44,260 --> 00:25:45,840
I want one of those right now.

484
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:46,440
Me too.

485
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:47,320
I'll get me one.

486
00:25:47,320 --> 00:25:54,080
I'd love to go to a flea market and find a flea market right now.

487
00:25:54,080 --> 00:26:01,800
Is there like a good there's not flea markets.

488
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:06,840
there's one in a Dumbo I think but that's so funny there's a place called Dumbo here

489
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:11,840
it is really funny I'd never where is Dumbo? It's up there it's like it's

490
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:23,480
downtown Brooklyn it's yeah yeah yeah I would not want to live there I would maybe it's magical

491
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:25,480
It's where the circus is

492
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:31,480
I don't think I think Dumbo is like $18 ice cream and shit oh yeah yeah it's

493
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:36,360
that's really stupid. It's bad now. We first moved here two years ago. It was

494
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:40,440
the coolest neighborhood in the world. The fucking losers move to New York. Oh

495
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:42,680
yeah. Everyone wants to move to a dumb ball.

496
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:49,080
I want to flea market like like the ones where they sell the which I guess is

497
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:50,840
just the new Hampshire flea market.

498
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:58,040
Yeah, because you can are you from New Hampshire from Massachusetts. He's

499
00:26:58,040 --> 00:27:02,680
where in New Hampshire? I'm from Londonderry. That's a made up place.

500
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:06,840
It's so fucked up. I think it used to be called Nutfield and then...

501
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:11,400
Do you think it used to be? Do you have a suspicion?

502
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:15,000
I have a feeling. I have a feeling.

503
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:19,960
I think Nutfield is like weird because there's places like Pinnardville.

504
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:26,960
There's Pinnardville but Pinnardville is technically Gothstown and then Nutfield is in Londonderry

505
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:31,360
I hate this damn New England tarmac. This guy just did words. He's just out here saying words.

506
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:34,880
Nutfield? Nutfield, yeah. Why'd they change it?

507
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:39,280
Oh you, you know what I'm doing. The indigenous people called it Nutfield.

508
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:41,200
Yeah, I think you're right. Yeah.

509
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:50,320
I met someone who like lives in New Hampshire and I was trying to get them to like come to New York

510
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:56,240
for the show this weekend and they were like it's six hours away and I was like what?

511
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:58,240
six hours from where?

512
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:00,240
I thought everything was like right, yeah.

513
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:02,240
To like top of the Keys?

514
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:04,240
It's probably four hours to London Airfinir.

515
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:06,240
So it's gotta be a little further than that.

516
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:08,240
Yeah.

517
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:10,240
It's probably two hours further.

518
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:12,240
I don't know where in New Hampshire exactly.

519
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:14,240
Probably two hours further.

520
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:16,240
Something tells me, yeah.

521
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:18,240
Okay smart guy.

522
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:20,240
Okay, well you didn't factor in traffic.

523
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:22,240
Five to six hours.

524
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:24,240
It's one to two hours.

525
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:26,500
(laughing)

526
00:28:26,500 --> 00:28:28,340
- Yeah, but the London Dairy Flea Market's sick

527
00:28:28,340 --> 00:28:30,040
'cause you can just get, it's like,

528
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:31,660
there's so many swords there.

529
00:28:31,660 --> 00:28:32,500
- Dude, yeah, I go--

530
00:28:32,500 --> 00:28:34,340
- It's the most amount of swords.

531
00:28:34,340 --> 00:28:36,800
- So every other booth is like, it's guns and swords,

532
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:39,360
and the next one is like, is $1 DVDs.

533
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:41,580
- Yeah, the ones that come in a plastic wrap.

534
00:28:41,580 --> 00:28:43,180
- Yeah, it's the best.

535
00:28:43,180 --> 00:28:46,640
- I could spend like five hours in a place like that.

536
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:50,120
- I would, like, you would go every other Sunday

537
00:28:50,120 --> 00:28:51,520
and just like make the rounds there,

538
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:53,920
just trying to get behind like knives and shit.

539
00:28:53,920 --> 00:28:55,120
Yeah, there is a

540
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:56,920
some of the best t-shirts ever too.

541
00:28:56,920 --> 00:28:58,620
In Wilmington that has like,

542
00:28:58,620 --> 00:29:01,120
I mean, it's just like a great like Southern one

543
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:04,220
where you can get like every famous painting

544
00:29:04,220 --> 00:29:06,420
that somebody has redone with Obama in it.

545
00:29:06,420 --> 00:29:07,120
Oh my God.

546
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:09,220
You can get like the Mona Lisa with Obama.

547
00:29:09,220 --> 00:29:11,320
You can get the Last Supper with Obama,

548
00:29:11,320 --> 00:29:12,120
just like all this shit.

549
00:29:12,120 --> 00:29:12,520
That's sick.

550
00:29:12,520 --> 00:29:15,120
And then also there's this booth that is like

551
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:15,520
this like one-

552
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:17,520
Is Obama Jesus in the Last Supper?

553
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:18,920
Or is he one of the disciples?

554
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:20,120
He's Jesus, yeah.

555
00:29:20,120 --> 00:29:20,920
And then I-

556
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:22,920
And he's all the disciples.

557
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:25,920
I actually, no, I think he's Jesus and then like...

558
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:27,920
Rahm Emanuel is like...

559
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:29,920
[laughter]

560
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:33,920
I think it's like, they give Obama Jesus and then like MLK is one of the disciples.

561
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:35,920
Oh my god!

562
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:37,920
Who's Judas?

563
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:39,920
Oh shit.

564
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:41,920
You.

565
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:43,920
Oh my god! I'm in the painting!

566
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:45,920
You know who Judas probably is?

567
00:29:45,920 --> 00:29:47,920
Mr. Kanye West.

568
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:49,920
That's right.

569
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:52,920
they also have at this sorry to have to say it

570
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:57,360
I don't know if you guys have been following along

571
00:29:57,360 --> 00:30:00,880
you go to a flea market and there's a booth and it's all paintings like that

572
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:03,880
but they're replaced with you

573
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:07,400
where did you get this? who did you get these?

574
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:10,400
it's uncanny it's not based on you

575
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:13,400
I'm actually like that at the one with all the Obama paintings

576
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:16,400
that happened one time because I thought you would think it was sweet

577
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:21,400
You bring it up all the time, you act like it was a weird move on my part.

578
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:26,640
This flea market also has this one booth that's like this older little Mexican lady and she's

579
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:32,000
selling the only things that she sells are posters and t-shirts that are in support of

580
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,200
El Chapo, the like drug guy.

581
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:35,200
Oh that's so sick.

582
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:38,560
So I have a shirt and it's just like, and it's just all these shirts that say like,

583
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:42,160
like don't arrest El Chapo, he's like the richest guy in the world, it's awesome that

584
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:45,960
he's rich, he has this many cars, this many shoes, it's so fucking cool.

585
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:47,660
I want a shirt that says all of that.

586
00:30:47,660 --> 00:30:48,060
Yeah.

587
00:30:48,060 --> 00:30:52,700
The one I have says, says the number 107 billionaire in the world, El Chapo Guzman.

588
00:30:52,700 --> 00:30:54,200
Sick.

589
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:54,560
Yeah.

590
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:55,860
That is so tight.

591
00:30:55,860 --> 00:31:00,900
Do you think she like, um, she, she's doing that for the love of the game, or

592
00:31:00,900 --> 00:31:04,260
do you think she like got into the trade somehow?

593
00:31:04,260 --> 00:31:07,560
You know what, everybody loves him in, in Mexico.

594
00:31:07,560 --> 00:31:09,460
Cause he would just like walk into it.

595
00:31:09,460 --> 00:31:09,960
I bet.

596
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:10,460
Yeah.

597
00:31:10,460 --> 00:31:12,660
He's like, he's like the biggest, everybody loves him.

598
00:31:12,660 --> 00:31:14,060
I'm wondering if he's like funding this.

599
00:31:14,060 --> 00:31:21,740
he's like sending her across America and she's just selling it to like North

600
00:31:21,740 --> 00:31:26,780
Carolina. It worked on me, dude. I'm pro him all the way. Apparently he like goes

601
00:31:26,780 --> 00:31:31,300
into very used to like walk into restaurants and he would just buy like

602
00:31:31,300 --> 00:31:34,460
like four or five times a day by everybody in the restaurant their meal

603
00:31:34,460 --> 00:31:38,740
and say give everybody money. I would I would support him if he's like what a

604
00:31:38,740 --> 00:31:42,740
president should be. Like a president should just be a guy who gives people money and walks around being cool.

605
00:31:42,740 --> 00:31:46,820
the president should buy me a big president should buy Patrick happy meal.

606
00:31:46,820 --> 00:31:50,200
I agree the best part of free markets that they don't do in other places.

607
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:54,140
They should do is if like like like if I'm looking at like a table, it's all

608
00:31:54,140 --> 00:31:57,380
DVDs and I like pick like I'm going to buy this transformers DVD or whatever

609
00:31:57,380 --> 00:32:00,940
and the guy will be like if you buy all my DVDs, I'll give you a good price.

610
00:32:00,940 --> 00:32:01,820
Yeah,

611
00:32:01,820 --> 00:32:05,500
let me buy all the food in the grocery store for cheap

612
00:32:05,500 --> 00:32:07,540
any store. I go in

613
00:32:07,540 --> 00:32:10,820

and he's got a fishing pole

622
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:45,420
and the boat just moves around.

623
00:32:45,420 --> 00:32:46,260
- Whoa.

624
00:32:46,260 --> 00:32:47,080

625
00:32:47,080 --> 00:32:49,260
- With a mannequin with like a fishing pole.

626
00:32:49,260 --> 00:32:50,940
It's so fucking sick.

627
00:32:50,940 --> 00:32:51,780
- That's awesome.

628
00:32:51,780 --> 00:32:52,620
- That's cool.

629
00:32:52,620 --> 00:32:54,140
- I gotta fucking, I gotta go there

00:32:54,140 --> 00:32:55,500
when I go there this weekend.

631
00:32:55,500 --> 00:32:56,700
- I gotta go there when I go there.

632
00:32:56,700 --> 00:32:59,380
- I gotta go there when I go there this weekend.

633
00:32:59,380 --> 00:33:01,060
- Yeah, I'm going to New Hampshire.

634
00:33:01,060 --> 00:33:02,700
- What are you gonna do in New Hampshire?

635
00:33:02,700 --> 00:33:04,620
- I didn't go home for Easter, so.

636
00:33:04,620 --> 00:33:05,460
- What?

637
00:33:05,460 --> 00:33:06,300
- Who goes home for Easter?

638
00:33:06,300 --> 00:33:08,300
That's not a normal thing.

639
00:33:08,300 --> 00:33:13,300
How many movies are there about like, there's someone who's already Easter.

640
00:33:13,300 --> 00:33:18,300
If you really believe in his word and power, Easter is always happening in your mind.

641
00:33:18,300 --> 00:33:23,300
It's Orthodox Easter. It's Greek Orthodox Easter. I'm not Greek or anything.

642
00:33:23,300 --> 00:33:24,300
I see, I see, I see.

643
00:33:24,300 --> 00:33:29,300
I just didn't go home last weekend and my mom wants us home for Easter every year.

644
00:33:29,300 --> 00:33:32,300
Why? I don't know. She fucking grew up Catholic. I don't know.

645
00:33:32,300 --> 00:33:34,300
Wait, but then it's not Easter though, anymore.

646
00:33:34,300 --> 00:33:43,220
It's Greek Orthodox Easter. Wait, was that her reasoning? That's not a joke you made? She actually is having you back for Greek Orthodox Easter?

647
00:33:43,220 --> 00:33:51,340
No. That's a joke I made. Okay. It's a joke? Also, I don't think that's true. Yes it is. Look up in the iPhone

648
00:33:51,340 --> 00:33:56,660
calendar. It's in there. They do it later than the normal? Did you check what holiday it was this weekend so you could have an excuse to go home?

649
00:33:56,660 --> 00:34:02,620
Orthodox Church also celebrates Christmas a lot later. Really? They're like, this is the actual

650
00:34:02,620 --> 00:34:07,900
calendar. And at least with like Christmas stuff I think they're kind of right.

651
00:34:07,900 --> 00:34:12,500
Do they, one of those Orthodox religions or like versions of Christianity have

652
00:34:12,500 --> 00:34:17,080
their own Pope and he's like way less popular. Yeah I think the Eastern

653
00:34:17,080 --> 00:34:21,860
Orthodox. There's several, there's the whole history of Popes is super weird.

654
00:34:21,860 --> 00:34:26,740
The Eastern Orthodox Pope like is, he looks exactly like Borat.

655
00:34:26,740 --> 00:34:29,560
I don't know if you mean he's wearing a swimsuit.

656
00:34:29,560 --> 00:34:36,540
Yeah, I don't know exactly what this is. I can't remember, but and I don't know

657
00:34:36,540 --> 00:34:39,700
if it still exists, but for a long time there was also a guy called the

658
00:34:39,700 --> 00:34:45,100
antipope. Yeah, yeah, there's like the pope and the antipope, which I think

659
00:34:45,100 --> 00:34:47,780
it'd be so cool to be the and decides on the antipode.

660
00:34:47,780 --> 00:34:54,180
No, it's like it was like some people were like no, the pope's the pope and

661
00:34:54,180 --> 00:34:57,240
something like the anti popes the pope well then you like it's easy to figure

662
00:34:57,240 --> 00:34:58,980
out who's the pope because he's the one that's not called the

663
00:34:58,980 --> 00:35:05,220
yeah his name is the not he loses a lot of credibility right off the bat

664
00:35:05,220 --> 00:35:10,340
changer start going I would have myself yeah the real pope yeah yeah I call

665
00:35:10,340 --> 00:35:14,060
myself the fancy Pope yeah I want to go visit that I can say I think I would

666
00:35:14,060 --> 00:35:18,140
call myself the illustrious

667
00:35:19,780 --> 00:35:24,220
something new. It sounds like poop. It does sound like poop.

668
00:35:24,220 --> 00:35:28,940
There's a dude he was like a historical reenactor in like the

669
00:35:28,940 --> 00:35:32,020
Boston Common. They just have that he's had like guys that

670
00:35:32,020 --> 00:35:36,180
fucking walk around there like yeah, they just have that now.

671
00:35:36,180 --> 00:35:43,860
And his name was Jeremiah poop. No, it's spelled like no at the

672
00:35:43,860 --> 00:35:44,860
in. P-O-O-P-E.

673
00:35:44,860 --> 00:35:45,860
P-O-O-P-E?

674
00:35:45,860 --> 00:35:46,860
Yeah.

675
00:35:46,860 --> 00:35:47,860
That's such a good name.

676
00:35:47,860 --> 00:35:50,860
He's like, "Well, it's pronounced different. It's Poo-oo-oop."

677
00:35:50,860 --> 00:35:53,860
You're not fooling anyone, dude.

678
00:35:53,860 --> 00:35:54,860
It's not poop, it's poopy.

679
00:35:54,860 --> 00:35:55,860
I know your name's Poop.

680
00:35:55,860 --> 00:35:59,860
It's also the perfect name for a historical reenactor. There's like a guy who's walking

681
00:35:59,860 --> 00:36:03,860
around in old colonial gear, like, "My name's Jeremiah Poop!"

682
00:36:03,860 --> 00:36:06,860
Jeremiah is also such a crazy first name.

683
00:36:06,860 --> 00:36:08,860
Is the only place he could become a celebrity.

684
00:36:08,860 --> 00:36:09,860
Is the only place he could become a celebrity.

685
00:36:09,860 --> 00:36:13,300
I don't I never saw him one of my friends

686
00:36:13,300 --> 00:36:17,140
One of my friends my friends got like

687
00:36:17,140 --> 00:36:27,420
No, he's like a real guy I like my friend like talked to him one time because like I don't remember

688
00:36:27,420 --> 00:36:32,460
But he was like, yeah, I talked to a guy named Jeremiah poop the other day when I was like 16

689
00:36:32,460 --> 00:36:34,460
I was like, what do you mean?

690
00:36:34,820 --> 00:36:41,680
Jeremiah poop fucking prove this to me and he showed me is like Facebook. That's like a name in like a like a bad college sketch

691
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:43,700
Yeah, Jeremiah poop

692
00:36:43,700 --> 00:37:00,960
I feel bad saying his name cuz it's just my a poop has a picture with Conan O'Brien. Oh

693
00:37:02,300 --> 00:37:07,700
because it's a real guy who I don't know but I'm sure he's like yeah the nicest

694
00:37:07,700 --> 00:37:24,300
people in the world I found is his Twitter account and the last tweets are

695
00:37:24,300 --> 00:37:28,800
before he retweeted an Onion article twice that said that it's just a picture

696
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:29,800
of a toilet.

697
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:30,800
No way!

698
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:37,800
I don't want anyone to look this guy up.

699
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:40,300
I feel so bad just saying his name.

700
00:37:40,300 --> 00:37:42,800
He only retweets the Onion, that's all he does.

701
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:44,800
Maybe he's awesome.

702
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:45,800
Who knows?

703
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:46,800
Yeah, he's cool.

704
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:50,300
I know a lot of Boston comedians did the historical reenactment of that.

705
00:37:50,300 --> 00:37:51,300
Yeah, that's so, why?

706
00:37:51,300 --> 00:37:52,800
Because it's, you know, it's so weird.

707
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:54,800
Yeah, I guess that's true.

708
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:57,800
He's doing tours, basically, but you get to have a cool outfit on.

709
00:37:57,800 --> 00:37:58,800
Yeah.

710
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:00,800
That's the only reason we think it's funny is because they're wearing the outfit.

711
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:04,800
Yeah, I don't think I would think this guy was funny if he wasn't.

712
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:08,800
Yeah, if he was just a normal guy named Jeremiah Poop working in an office, that wouldn't be funny at all.

713
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:09,800
Yeah, that would not be funny.

714
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:14,800
I went on a historical Salem tour one time.

715
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:22,740
And my like the the dude who's like clearly like one of those like, you know, like I moved to Salem because I'm a Wiccan

716
00:38:22,740 --> 00:38:24,740
Oh cool, and

717
00:38:24,740 --> 00:38:27,120
He like in the middle of his fucking

718
00:38:27,120 --> 00:38:32,080
Thing like the middle of the Tories just like and by the way, I am a brony

719
00:38:32,080 --> 00:38:43,480
Like his fucking tour we're like he's like, yeah, so bear with me I do have ADHD

720
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:55,480
squirrel. He's walking around in a top hat in Salem. That's what happens to those kids

721
00:38:55,480 --> 00:39:01,140
man they become Salem reenactors. Oh yeah yeah he's talking about like Giles

722
00:39:01,140 --> 00:39:05,720
Corey with like the more weight shit and then I think he's peppered in that ADHD

723
00:39:05,720 --> 00:39:10,040
joke again. That's cool man. I would love to be I want to be one of the double

724
00:39:10,040 --> 00:39:15,960
Decker tour bus guys. Yeah. I feel like if last comic scene was still around, that tour

725
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:24,480
guy would get it. He'd go really really far. He would crush it. He would take the whole

726
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:33,680
thing home. He would take home the comic statue. They would build a statue of him like they

727
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:38,560
have with the Bee Witch Lady in Salem. They would put him there. Salem has a statue of

728
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:42,880
different witch on every corner yeah dog shit city yeah I don't really like

729
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:47,380
worst worst worst town in New England

730
00:39:47,380 --> 00:39:49,380
it's way too scary

731
00:39:49,380 --> 00:39:51,380
I hate it for no reason

732
00:39:51,380 --> 00:39:53,380
it's not the ghost or anything

733
00:39:53,380 --> 00:40:03,380
I'm sorry I've tried to like understand this you hate Salem because they respect women enough

734
00:40:03,380 --> 00:40:07,380
to make statues of these fallen heroes

735
00:40:07,380 --> 00:40:09,380
statues of evil women.

736
00:40:09,380 --> 00:40:11,620
(laughter)

737
00:40:11,620 --> 00:40:12,460
- Statues of like, yeah.

738
00:40:12,460 --> 00:40:15,620
- It wasn't about misogyny, there were real witches.

739
00:40:15,620 --> 00:40:17,860
(laughter)

740
00:40:17,860 --> 00:40:20,940
- Yeah, you don't understand,

741
00:40:20,940 --> 00:40:23,380
they had scary pointy hats and robes.

742
00:40:23,380 --> 00:40:25,460
- Okay, now I understand.

743
00:40:25,460 --> 00:40:27,460
- Oh, it's a misogynist witch hunt.

744
00:40:27,460 --> 00:40:29,340
No, they're doing magic on me.

745
00:40:29,340 --> 00:40:30,740
(laughter)

746
00:40:30,740 --> 00:40:32,180
- They're flying on the brooms

747
00:40:32,180 --> 00:40:33,620
when they should be using them for cleaning.

748
00:40:33,620 --> 00:40:34,460
I'm sorry.

749
00:40:34,460 --> 00:40:35,580
- Yeah.

750
00:40:35,580 --> 00:40:36,900
- The house is dirty.

No, is it sounding weird?

756
00:41:18,020 --> 00:41:20,020
It's your cord, whatever, it's fine.

757
00:41:20,020 --> 00:41:22,020
Basically doesn't matter at all.

758
00:41:22,020 --> 00:41:24,020
I went one time and I didn't even do any scary stuff.

759
00:41:24,020 --> 00:41:28,020
Yeah, we went there to go see our friend do a stand up set.

760
00:41:28,020 --> 00:41:30,020
Oh, I've been there twice then.

761
00:41:30,020 --> 00:41:32,020
I used to live real close to there.

762
00:41:32,020 --> 00:41:34,020
I used to live in Revere for a little bit.

763
00:41:34,020 --> 00:41:36,020
Seems like it sucks.

764
00:41:36,020 --> 00:41:38,020
It's literally...

765
00:41:38,020 --> 00:41:40,020
Are you talking about Salem?

766
00:41:40,020 --> 00:41:42,020
Yeah, it's an adult field trip.

767
00:41:42,020 --> 00:41:44,020
Yeah, yeah.

768
00:41:44,020 --> 00:41:47,300

00:42:01,960 --> 00:42:06,300
cool like actual haunted houses in new england yeah i do know what i want to

775
00:42:06,300 --> 00:42:09,900
bring out a little bit of a serious issue of the go is in the amityville

776
00:42:09,900 --> 00:42:11,220
house in new england

777
00:42:11,220 --> 00:42:15,940
I think it's upstate New York. Is it? Yeah. I think it might be. I'm pretty sure it's upstate

778
00:42:15,940 --> 00:42:21,940
New York. Lizzie Borden house is in New England. Is that the Winchester house in New England?

779
00:42:21,940 --> 00:42:27,460
No, that's also in upstate New York. Really? Oh my god. Okay, they're all there then. That's

780
00:42:27,460 --> 00:42:32,900
a scary place. Upstate New York haunted as hell. A lot of people think that the World Trade Center

781
00:42:32,900 --> 00:42:38,340
in Manhattan. It's actually the same. It's in Albany.

782
00:42:38,340 --> 00:42:41,700
Jaws. Jaws is in New England though. And he's scary as hell.

783
00:42:41,700 --> 00:42:42,740
Jaws? The shark?

784
00:42:42,740 --> 00:42:43,380
Yeah, the shark.

785
00:42:43,380 --> 00:42:45,300
Did he haunt a house?

786
00:42:45,300 --> 00:42:47,140
Yeah, he haunted the beach.

787
00:42:47,140 --> 00:42:47,940
Holy shit.

788
00:42:47,940 --> 00:42:49,220
Oh shit, this beach is haunted by ghost sharks.

789
00:42:49,220 --> 00:42:54,340
He haunted the memories of the men who survived the fateful summer.

790
00:42:54,340 --> 00:42:56,660
Oh fuck, my beach is haunted with sharks.

791
00:42:56,660 --> 00:42:59,540
Oh shit. Oh god.

792
00:42:59,540 --> 00:43:06,540
It would be impossible to tell if a ghost shark or a regular shark was attacking people.

793
00:43:06,540 --> 00:43:07,540
That's true!

794
00:43:07,540 --> 00:43:08,540
Oh shit!

795
00:43:08,540 --> 00:43:12,960
So you can, like, yeah, anything that is a ghost that's not a human, how do you even

796
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:14,300
know if it's a ghost or not?

797
00:43:14,300 --> 00:43:15,300
Oh my god.

798
00:43:15,300 --> 00:43:16,300
We might be haunted by bugs here.

799
00:43:16,300 --> 00:43:19,380
This would be like underwater, especially if people are being eaten, you know?

800
00:43:19,380 --> 00:43:23,020
Like if you like find half of their body or something.

801
00:43:23,020 --> 00:43:24,020
That's true!

802
00:43:24,020 --> 00:43:25,020
Yeah.

803
00:43:25,020 --> 00:43:29,100
Then if you get half of your body eaten, is there like half of a ghost out there?

804
00:43:29,100 --> 00:43:32,780
You could tell if you find half a body and they're and there's a full ghost

805
00:43:32,780 --> 00:43:33,780
who's half hungry.

806
00:43:33,780 --> 00:43:34,780
They look really scared.

807
00:43:34,780 --> 00:43:35,780
It's probably a ghost shark.

808
00:43:35,780 --> 00:43:36,780
Ghosts by getting eaten all the way.

809
00:43:36,780 --> 00:43:37,780
That's not the rule.

810
00:43:37,780 --> 00:43:38,780
Like really, really scared.

811
00:43:38,780 --> 00:43:39,780
If they peed themselves.

812
00:43:39,780 --> 00:43:40,780
Yeah.

813
00:43:40,780 --> 00:43:45,780
If you find half a body with teeth marks and they're as pale as a sheet,

814
00:43:45,780 --> 00:43:46,780
that was a ghost shark.

815
00:43:46,780 --> 00:43:54,780
And they kind of got like George from Seinfeld face going on.

816
00:43:54,780 --> 00:43:57,300
That was probably a ghost shark.

817
00:43:57,300 --> 00:43:59,900
Have you guys ever been viciously attacked by a shark?

818
00:43:59,900 --> 00:44:00,900
Not yet.

819
00:44:00,900 --> 00:44:01,900
No.

820
00:44:01,900 --> 00:44:02,900
A couple times.

821
00:44:02,900 --> 00:44:04,900
One time I got attacked by a bunch of jellyfish.

822
00:44:04,900 --> 00:44:05,900
Really?

823
00:44:05,900 --> 00:44:06,900
What do you mean they attacked you?

824
00:44:06,900 --> 00:44:07,900
Don't they just float?

825
00:44:07,900 --> 00:44:08,900
Wow!

826
00:44:08,900 --> 00:44:09,900
Jellyfish attacked me!

827
00:44:09,900 --> 00:44:15,900
Okay, so I was in like open water and before the keys.

828
00:44:15,900 --> 00:44:18,900
They intentionally swam and they attacked me.

829
00:44:18,900 --> 00:44:26,620
And I was like diving down and I was like 17 and as I was coming back up what had been

830
00:44:26,620 --> 00:44:31,940
like totally clear was now just like what looked like a mile of jellyfish.

831
00:44:31,940 --> 00:44:32,580
Whoa.

832
00:44:32,580 --> 00:44:37,260
So like I'd only, I wasn't like scuba and so I was only down for a second,

833
00:44:37,260 --> 00:44:42,300
you know? So I had to go through like, like, like, like 10 feet of jellyfish.

834
00:44:42,300 --> 00:44:43,820
Oh my God.

835
00:44:43,820 --> 00:44:48,900
I was okay. It actually wasn't the end of the world, but like it was, it was,

836
00:44:48,900 --> 00:44:51,060
yeah, that's basically a shark when you think about it.

837
00:44:51,060 --> 00:44:55,460
It's also, it's funny that that is an attack. They just,

838
00:44:55,460 --> 00:44:56,980
they occupy your air.

839
00:44:56,980 --> 00:44:57,820
- Exactly.

840
00:44:57,820 --> 00:44:58,660
- I'm taking it over.

841
00:44:58,660 --> 00:44:59,480
- Sorry, sorry, sorry.

842
00:44:59,480 --> 00:45:01,580
- When you said attack, I was thinking like a

843
00:45:01,580 --> 00:45:06,580
SpongeBob jellyfish came up and stuck his tentacle out at you

844
00:45:06,580 --> 00:45:07,500
and stung you.

845
00:45:07,500 --> 00:45:11,460
And also when you got electrocuted, you saw your bones.

846
00:45:11,460 --> 00:45:12,300
- Yeah.

847
00:45:12,300 --> 00:45:13,120
- You turned blue and saw your bones.

848
00:45:13,120 --> 00:45:13,960
- That'd be cool, that'd be cool.

849
00:45:13,960 --> 00:45:14,780
- Yeah.

850
00:45:14,780 --> 00:45:18,640
- Yeah, well actually the problem is I got stung so much

851
00:45:18,640 --> 00:45:20,740
that they stung my swimsuit off

852
00:45:20,740 --> 00:45:22,620
and I was on a Boy Scout trip.

853
00:45:22,620 --> 00:45:23,460
- Oh my God.

854
00:45:23,460 --> 00:45:31,460
so all the Scoutmasters saw my minor dick and that is why they all went to jail.

855
00:45:31,460 --> 00:45:37,060
A lot of people think that they're pedophiles. They weren't. They just happened to see my

856
00:45:37,060 --> 00:45:41,460
penis and then immediately went to jail. So the jellyfish, mostly they attacked your Scoutmasters,

857
00:45:41,460 --> 00:45:46,340
not even really you. I'm sure those Scoutmasters are in jail to this day.

858
00:45:46,340 --> 00:45:52,100
There's just a guy like in a boat far away, he's like, "My jellyfish plan worked!"

859
00:45:52,100 --> 00:45:55,100
evil scoutmaster

860
00:45:55,100 --> 00:46:00,300
he will see he sounds evil he sounds like the evil one

861
00:46:00,300 --> 00:46:03,460
well that's not necessary perception i mean he's attacking evil

862
00:46:03,460 --> 00:46:09,140
describing right now is eerily similar to what's happening to transfer

863
00:46:09,140 --> 00:46:16,380
there's a guy on a boat

864
00:46:16,380 --> 00:46:23,380
I would say yeah, essentially, there's a man on a boat trying to make it look like trans women are pedophiles

865
00:46:23,380 --> 00:46:27,380
through any means necessary and then saying "Aha!"

866
00:46:27,380 --> 00:46:31,380
"I sniped the W.O. off that bathroom sign!"

867
00:46:31,380 --> 00:46:36,380
"Now they're gonna get in trouble!"

868
00:46:36,380 --> 00:46:41,380
"I'm Steven!"

869
00:46:41,380 --> 00:46:43,380
"Don't give that to me."

870
00:46:43,380 --> 00:46:45,380
Steven Universe!

871
00:46:45,380 --> 00:46:54,080
Yeah, that's why I never got that show.

872
00:46:54,080 --> 00:46:55,980
Like, a lot of people like that show when he does that stuff.

873
00:46:55,980 --> 00:46:58,680
Yeah, it's really fucked up.

874
00:46:58,680 --> 00:46:59,580
Yeah, it's not cool.

875
00:46:59,580 --> 00:47:02,680
People always think, for some reason, they think like Steven Universe is a

876
00:47:02,680 --> 00:47:07,680
Tenderware show, even though it's a show about an eleven year old boy trying to

877
00:47:07,680 --> 00:47:09,380
get his many trades women arrested.

878
00:47:09,380 --> 00:47:16,380
And he looks into the camera and announces it like jackass every time.

879
00:47:16,380 --> 00:47:17,380
He's doing a prank.

880
00:47:17,380 --> 00:47:21,380
Hi, I'm Steven Universe and this is Getting Grace Arrested.

881
00:47:21,380 --> 00:47:24,380
Burn her now.

882
00:47:24,380 --> 00:47:28,380
Oh man.

883
00:47:28,380 --> 00:47:32,380
Did they even put gay people in that show or was it just because it looked gay?

884
00:47:32,380 --> 00:47:39,420
They did put like I'm like okay, Steven Universe is like an interesting show because like a lot of people

885
00:47:39,420 --> 00:47:45,740
Prescribe it as this like super tender queer syrupy show and it like kind of was at the beginning

886
00:47:45,740 --> 00:47:49,440
But also it was made for kids, you know, but there is like there is gay shit

887
00:47:49,440 --> 00:47:51,440
There's a gay like wedding and a show for kids

888
00:47:51,440 --> 00:47:59,920
The weird thing about the show is the last season of it is called Steven Universe future

889
00:47:59,920 --> 00:48:06,840
And it jumps like a few years into the future and it's all about like how Steven has like PTSD from saving the universe essentially now

890
00:48:06,840 --> 00:48:08,360
He's going

891
00:48:08,360 --> 00:48:10,460
He's like kind of a piece of shit in it

892
00:48:10,460 --> 00:48:14,740
And so all these tender queer fans hated it because they were like, what do you mean?

893
00:48:14,740 --> 00:48:18,140
You have a care like the main character like isn't just like a good boy

894
00:48:18,140 --> 00:48:26,400
That's weird. I really like how it ended but like a lot of the big fans were like it's like the same

895
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:30,260
Like people like a lot of like these dumb queers like act like

896
00:48:30,260 --> 00:48:33,720
Steven universe and shit like that is there like

897
00:48:33,720 --> 00:48:38,540
Examples of like what good media is that teaches kids and teaches people how to act yeah

898
00:48:38,540 --> 00:48:45,320
And then this show ended with like Steven like being a piece of shit kind of and they were not and they were like

899
00:48:45,320 --> 00:48:56,200
Yeah, I'll be pretty pissed off if Spongebob started acting like

900
00:48:56,200 --> 00:49:03,200
it

901
00:49:03,200 --> 00:49:08,560
it's nice to his friends squidward inmates and i had a very for mister crabs

902
00:49:08,560 --> 00:49:13,920
very hard to get a crappy patio he's a best-fried cook in the in all but he is

903
00:49:13,920 --> 00:49:20,920
yeah but he's never recognized as privileged

904
00:49:21,360 --> 00:49:32,100
it's true shit I never thought of SpongeBob like that I'm learning it is

905
00:49:32,100 --> 00:49:36,700
funny that like there of all the cartoons somehow SpongeBob is the one

906
00:49:36,700 --> 00:49:40,080
that has the most like five-hour YouTube videos about it oh yeah they're not

907
00:49:40,080 --> 00:49:43,560
about like the politics of it at all it's just like SpongeBob is actually a

908
00:49:43,560 --> 00:49:48,960
sociopath yeah yeah and then you watch you're like you're spitting right now

909
00:49:48,960 --> 00:49:54,160
yeah that's true boys on one not tree Squidward with respect actually low-key

910
00:49:54,160 --> 00:49:59,760
mean to him it makes no sense there's this guy my partner went to high school

911
00:49:59,760 --> 00:50:04,480
with who who makes us like make spongebob edits but they're not they're

912
00:50:04,480 --> 00:50:11,480
not like why Spongebob has like AIDS or whatever. That's a good one though. That was heartbreaking.

913
00:50:11,480 --> 00:50:18,480
Six hour video. They're just like these weird like psychedelic edits that people really like.

914
00:50:18,480 --> 00:50:29,560
And mishmashes. And we were at their friend's place, like their other high school friend's

915
00:50:29,560 --> 00:50:33,520
place and they put on a video from him. And I was like oh it's so cool that he's doing

916
00:50:33,520 --> 00:50:37,640
this now, you know? He was kind of a weirdo in high school and whatnot. And then two weeks

917
00:50:37,640 --> 00:50:43,200
later this guy messages M's friend and is like, "Hey, I need to tell you something about

918
00:50:43,200 --> 00:50:50,200
myself and I'm trying to work through it and it's been really difficult." And so Swaya

919
00:50:50,200 --> 00:50:55,280
thought that, "Oh, he's coming out to me. We haven't really talked since high school,

920
00:50:55,280 --> 00:50:59,320
but I guess maybe he just needs someone, you know? And that's totally cool." And she's

921
00:50:59,320 --> 00:51:06,320
what's up and what he was coming out as was attracted to pregnant women.

922
00:51:06,320 --> 00:51:08,320
Woah!

923
00:51:08,320 --> 00:51:10,320
Oh my god!

924
00:51:10,320 --> 00:51:12,320
Oh my god!

925
00:51:12,320 --> 00:51:14,320
That is awesome!

926
00:51:14,320 --> 00:51:16,320
Hell yeah dude!

927
00:51:16,320 --> 00:51:18,320
That's so sick!

928
00:51:18,320 --> 00:51:20,320
So pleasant to meet you.

929
00:51:20,320 --> 00:51:22,320
Are you supposed to come out for that?

930
00:51:22,320 --> 00:51:24,320
Yes!

931
00:51:24,320 --> 00:51:26,320
Mom, Dad.

932
00:51:26,320 --> 00:51:31,320
You are in the closet if you are not told people about that.

933
00:51:31,320 --> 00:51:37,320
Just taking your mom and dad out to like a dinner at the age of 28.

934
00:51:37,320 --> 00:51:43,320
It's just something I've like always known about myself since I was like really young and I don't know.

935
00:51:43,320 --> 00:51:45,320
You know, it's currently...

936
00:51:45,320 --> 00:51:48,320
I like when a woman blows up like a balloon.

937
00:51:48,320 --> 00:51:53,320
Your mom is like, "We know honey. We always knew."

938
00:51:53,320 --> 00:51:55,320
We always knew baby.

939
00:51:55,320 --> 00:52:04,780
sad that people in that community can't get married. The kid

940
00:52:04,780 --> 00:52:06,960
starts bringing home exclusively pregnant.

941
00:52:06,960 --> 00:52:18,960
He sends fire a photo of him with a pregnant chick. It's like,

942
00:52:19,280 --> 00:52:22,680
"Yeah, I just visited this girl in Ohio."

943
00:52:22,680 --> 00:52:23,520
(laughing)

944
00:52:23,520 --> 00:52:24,360
- Whoa.

945
00:52:24,360 --> 00:52:26,520
- So he not only was coming out,

946
00:52:26,520 --> 00:52:29,680
he was that way, I don't know, pregnant.

947
00:52:29,680 --> 00:52:31,600
(laughing)

948
00:52:31,600 --> 00:52:33,640
- That's actually, it's cool that you can,

949
00:52:33,640 --> 00:52:37,440
if you're into pregnant women and you're like a single guy,

950
00:52:37,440 --> 00:52:39,560
you have like a cap on how much,

951
00:52:39,560 --> 00:52:41,800
how like long you can like somebody.

952
00:52:41,800 --> 00:52:43,080
Where it's like, as soon as they have the baby,

953
00:52:43,080 --> 00:52:43,920
you're like, "Oh yeah, I'll just fucking."

954
00:52:43,920 --> 00:52:45,080
- That's a rom-com.

955
00:52:45,080 --> 00:52:45,900
- Just fine.

956
00:52:45,900 --> 00:52:47,360
(laughing)

957
00:52:47,360 --> 00:52:48,200
- Yes, yes, yes.

958
00:52:48,200 --> 00:52:49,880
It's like we only have two more weeks.

959
00:52:49,880 --> 00:52:54,440
I will find you disgusting as every other normal woman in the

960
00:52:54,440 --> 00:52:54,840
world.

961
00:52:54,840 --> 00:52:58,800
There's like a really tragic scene where he's giving birth and

962
00:52:58,800 --> 00:53:00,160
he's like sobbing.

963
00:53:00,160 --> 00:53:01,880
Yeah, he's not. Oh, God.

964
00:53:01,880 --> 00:53:06,480
That's the resolution.

965
00:53:06,480 --> 00:53:10,960
With a bowling ball like Indiana Jones.

966
00:53:10,960 --> 00:53:16,000
The movie called the plug. This girl like because she knows that

967
00:53:16,040 --> 00:53:22,240
Her BF will like leave her when she has the kid like buys like just like one of those big old timey bathtub plugs

968
00:53:22,240 --> 00:53:27,240
And she just keeps getting bigger and bigger

969
00:53:27,240 --> 00:53:30,000
15

970
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:36,520
That's how I want that I wish I could have just spent 18 years me too. Oh, man you get so much done in there

971
00:53:36,520 --> 00:53:43,520
here

972
00:53:43,520 --> 00:53:50,040
you know that they sell those like fake pregnant suits on amazon we should get

973
00:53:50,040 --> 00:53:51,040
them

974
00:53:51,040 --> 00:53:54,640
i could write that off as a business expense

975
00:53:54,640 --> 00:53:58,200
i'm gonna get one of those i'm not joking i'm gonna get a fake pregnant suit

976
00:53:58,200 --> 00:53:58,880
and wear it around

977
00:53:58,880 --> 00:54:00,200
a big pregnancy suit just like

978
00:54:00,200 --> 00:54:02,420
Oh, I'm gonna wear it to the bar and like

979
00:54:02,420 --> 00:54:10,120
Don't

980
00:54:10,120 --> 00:54:17,300
Don't buy one of those yourselves yourself because me and Camille might have already

981
00:54:17,300 --> 00:54:25,160
My god

982
00:54:25,160 --> 00:54:30,360
with the pregnancy suit. I'm gonna wear it to the bar and get tainted. I want a whiskey neep.

983
00:54:30,360 --> 00:54:36,280
Can I get a gin and tonic for the little one?

984
00:54:36,280 --> 00:54:41,080
We're like wearing it. I'm drinking for two tonight. Wearing like the biggest one that

985
00:54:41,080 --> 00:54:44,040
makes it look like you're nine months pregnant and then pretending you get a phone call and

986
00:54:44,040 --> 00:54:51,400
you're like oh my god I'm pregnant. I would try to do that prank but I would accidentally put the

987
00:54:52,040 --> 00:54:55,440
suit on backwards. Yeah, I probably would have a sumo suit.

988
00:54:55,440 --> 00:54:58,360
I'm pregnant.

989
00:54:58,360 --> 00:54:59,680
Like what?

990
00:54:59,680 --> 00:55:01,640
Why do you have a

991
00:55:01,640 --> 00:55:05,080
no, I know I know you're not pregnant, but I'm not gonna serve

992
00:55:05,080 --> 00:55:06,440
you because your fat is full.

993
00:55:06,440 --> 00:55:11,600
Call it the bar. You're like we the abortion appointment is back

994
00:55:11,600 --> 00:55:12,680
on. Okay,

995
00:55:12,680 --> 00:55:15,360
swag. I have to go right now.

996
00:55:15,360 --> 00:55:18,720
You're totally tanked and

997
00:55:19,520 --> 00:55:22,560
Somebody on the jukebox weighs that fucking it's a

998
00:55:22,560 --> 00:55:33,480
Yeah, you're running out you're running out of the bar you think it's a push door you just run

999
00:55:33,480 --> 00:55:46,400
Like 10 a.m. In the morning full pregnancy suit you order your first drink when you time it just right

1000
00:55:46,400 --> 00:55:51,400
So just as you're about to take a sip on the screen CNN reports that the Supreme

1001
00:55:51,400 --> 00:56:02,440

Nah, I could have impregnated a woman if I even wanted to at the time.

1048
00:59:02,280 --> 00:59:03,440
I didn't have a job.

1049
00:59:03,440 --> 00:59:06,440

00:59:06,440 --> 00:59:09,820
I had nothing. I was shooting blanks.

1051
00:59:09,820 --> 00:59:10,820

What were you-- you were doing meeting nuts at nine years old?

1056
00:59:17,280 --> 00:59:18,280
No way.

1057
00:59:18,280 --> 00:59:19,280

00:59:19,280 --> 00:59:20,780
Creamy mayo?

1059
00:59:20,780 --> 00:59:21,780
I was blasted.

1060
00:59:21,780 --> 00:59:22,780
No. No chance.

1061
00:59:22,780 --> 00:59:25,920
I was cumming in the bathtub and it was just making bubbles.

1062
00:59:25,920 --> 00:59:30,040
it was all that was happening at the time. Yeah, I was like nine like pixie

1063
00:59:30,040 --> 00:59:33,800
dust when I was nine and I first learned about that and I was like, okay, I

1064
00:59:33,800 --> 00:59:38,400
guess I have to try that because I'm growing up and it like I think I was at

1065
00:59:38,400 --> 00:59:42,200
it for like an hour and then I peed and there's foam and I was like that must

1066
00:59:42,200 --> 00:59:42,880
be my sperm.

1067
00:59:42,880 --> 00:59:51,000
That must be it. That's gotta be my sperm. That must be my sperm. My sperms

1068
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:55,440
must be those bubbles. Oh and then and then like I think I also breathing in

1069
00:59:55,460 --> 00:59:59,560
pee. I saw there's like a you know when like a hair gets in a toilet and like it

1070
00:59:59,560 --> 01:00:03,140
knows like that like if there's like a hair in the toilet and it has like that

1071
01:00:03,140 --> 01:00:08,060
reflection it kind of makes it look like a like a sperm. I saw that and I was like

1072
01:00:08,060 --> 01:00:11,060
that's the biggest sperm you've ever seen.

1073
01:00:11,060 --> 01:00:17,060
Wait, the biggest sperm you've ever seen, it's the first sperm.

1074
01:00:17,060 --> 01:00:19,060
And even then you're like that's too big.

1075
01:00:19,060 --> 01:00:21,060
That's way too big.

1076
01:00:21,060 --> 01:00:23,060
It's too huge.

1077
01:00:23,060 --> 01:00:25,060
That's crazy.

1078
01:00:25,060 --> 01:00:27,060
I must have the biggest sperm of all time.

1079
01:00:27,060 --> 01:00:29,060
It'd be so cool if sperm was big and it hurt to come out.

1080
01:00:29,060 --> 01:00:31,060
Yeah, if you saw it.

1081
01:00:31,060 --> 01:00:33,060
You got one.

1082
01:00:33,060 --> 01:00:35,060
Like little bugs.

1083
01:00:35,060 --> 01:00:37,060
You shot one nasty butt.

1084
01:00:37,060 --> 01:00:39,060
One nasty tadpole at your thing.

1085
01:00:39,060 --> 01:00:41,060
Now that's a rom-com.

1086
01:00:41,060 --> 01:00:45,060
Falling in love with your own sperm.

1087
01:00:45,060 --> 01:00:47,060
Oh my god.

1088
01:00:47,060 --> 01:00:49,060
It took me like a while.

1089
01:00:49,060 --> 01:00:51,060
I feel like all of my friends

1090
01:00:51,060 --> 01:00:53,060

01:00:53,060 --> 01:00:58,220

1092
01:00:58,220 --> 01:01:05,720

1093
01:01:05,720 --> 01:01:09,300

Thank you for having us.

1115
01:02:20,220 --> 01:02:23,540
Anything else you want to say about getting hit in the head?

1116
01:02:23,540 --> 01:02:25,540
I just want to say, can I say one last thing?

1117
01:02:25,540 --> 01:02:30,620
Sorry, I just want to say I accept you for your attraction to pregnant women and I hope

1118
01:02:30,620 --> 01:02:31,620
that it becomes legal.

1119
01:02:31,620 --> 01:02:32,620
I hope so.

1120
01:02:32,620 --> 01:02:35,820
We've been fighting the good fight for many, many years.

1121
01:02:35,820 --> 01:02:37,820
I just want to say the exact opposite.

1122
01:02:37,820 --> 01:02:39,820
You don't support me?

1123
01:02:39,820 --> 01:02:40,820
No.

1124
01:02:40,820 --> 01:02:41,820
I'll be in the middle.

1125
01:02:41,820 --> 01:02:46,460
It's like my version, you have skateboarding, I have jacking off to millions of pregnant

1126
01:02:46,460 --> 01:02:47,460
women every day.

1127
01:02:47,460 --> 01:02:54,460
I just want to say that I think as long as men are punching women in the head at bars,

1128
01:02:54,460 --> 01:02:58,460
that none of these men should be getting any women pregnant.

1129
01:02:58,460 --> 01:02:59,460
Dang!

1130
01:02:59,460 --> 01:03:00,460
Oh!

1131
01:03:00,460 --> 01:03:01,460
Oh!

1132
01:03:01,460 --> 01:03:02,460
Feminism!

1133
01:03:02,460 --> 01:03:03,460
Yeah, sorry.

1134
01:03:03,460 --> 01:03:04,460
Just for my thing.

1135
01:03:04,460 --> 01:03:05,460
Oh!

1136
01:03:05,460 --> 01:03:06,460
Bye!
