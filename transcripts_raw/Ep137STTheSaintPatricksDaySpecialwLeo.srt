00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:13,000
[Music]

2
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Somewhere between Bed-Stuy and Honolulu, the perfect little town of Boston, California,

3
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
sleeps peacefully among the Brady Woods, a small forest nearby where Bostonians will

4
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
hike and throw rocks at animals.

5
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Nothing crazy really ever happens in the Brady Woods, though.

6
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,600
Sure a bear might stick his hand in a beehive to get some honey, then his hand will get stuck,

7
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:33,600
and then some bees will take the shape of a giant boot and kick the bear in the rump.

8
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:37,200
Then the boot will chase the bear around and around in a circle, hopping of course, while

9
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:39,840
the bear desperately tries to shake the beehive off his hand.

10
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:40,840
Like that'll happen.

11
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:44,920
But other than that, and the occasional dead girl Jared Letoberry is here, nothing strange

12
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:47,360
ever happens in Brady Woods.

13
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:52,440
But as the day begins to break after a night of long rain, on this March 16th, the day

14
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:58,360
before St. Paddy's Day. A rainbow crests across the sky in the wee hours of the morning. And

15
00:00:58,360 --> 00:01:02,840
along that rainbow, if you listen closely enough, you can hear the gleeful giggles of some fantastic

16
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:07,240
little creatures, proudly bearing their four-leaf clovers in their buckled shoes, but obscured by

17
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:11,880
the morning mist, which is actually smoke, because the Pats won, so everyone decided to blow up the

18
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:20,920
Italian Community Center for shits and gigs. These little green monsters frolic about the woods,

19
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:25,120
hardy and tardy in a way, turning squirrels inside out and tricking fishermen into catching

20
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:26,120
their own trousers.

21
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:29,960
One in particular, however, got a bit lost in all the excitement.

22
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:34,960
For you see, he saw what he thought was a giant potato, the most sacred of all starches.

23
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:39,360
As the little guy scurried over, pulling down his green top hat on his ginger curls, he

24
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:41,680
geared up to take a chomp out of this big brown thing.

25
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:46,480
"What the fuck!" said the potato, for it was no potato at all, but just a man wearing

26
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:47,480
brown.

27
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:51,560
Before our friend could issue an apology, the man was chasing him across the woods, dashing

28
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:53,360
frantically among the trees.

29
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:56,760
This little creature showed great agility, using his grubby little hands and feet to pivot

30
00:01:56,760 --> 00:02:00,520
and tumble among the branches, trunks, and roots that populated the brady woods.

31
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:04,360
Eventually, he found himself no longer in the forest at all, but on the outskirts of

32
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:07,440
town, in what looked like a backyard of sorts.

33
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:11,640
Mangy and unkempt, the face scamp seemed to have lost the angry potato man.

34
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:12,640
What joy!

35
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:16,120
The little fella began to twirl a gold coin between his fingers, produce little trinkets

36
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:20,040
and charms and magical effects from beneath his path in an impromptu jaunty celebration.

37
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:25,560
Meanwhile, on his way to Duncan to get 10 kreles to stand in front of a paki until it opens,

38
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:28,440
another potato looking fella shuffled across the outskirts of town.

39
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:33,960
When he spotted our stout pal prancing about, shocked, thinking he might be still drunk from

40
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:37,880
the bottle of Jack he had about 20 minutes ago, this Bostonian rubbed his eyes but no

41
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:41,880
clear as day, or as clear as day could ever be, but with it being all blurry all the time,

42
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:45,400
He was seeing what he was seeing. He was seeing something weird.

43
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:48,680
I don't think I need to tell you what happens next, but in case you didn't know,

44
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:52,200
they got a saying in Boston, California. If something seems weird, you should probably

45
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:57,160
throw a beer can at it. And with a crude wind-up and thunk, our leprechaun was knocked out cold

46
00:02:57,160 --> 00:03:01,720
in the backyard. The tiny guy's friends were starting up the rainbow again and heading out.

47
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:06,760
That's right, you can start up rainbows. They had a big day tomorrow, and they needed to make

48
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:11,240
sure they were ready. Thinking they had everyone accounted for, they rode the rainbow back into

49
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:38,400
the

50
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:44,780
This is where I start my and Keith benefits mom is is you know huffing and puffing around and yelling all the kids and

51
00:03:44,780 --> 00:03:51,200
Yeah, who are you kids you hanging outside hanging out inside playing the sex life and videotape board game. You guys are friends

52
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:55,520
Who are you? I'm Keith benefits. I'm the class prankster

53
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:58,840
I'm known all around town for my pranks the other day

54
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:03,340
I did an awesome prank where I took all the money from the Jerry's kids bucket at the arcade

55
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:07,920
I don't know who those kids are, but they got hit with the prank of the century

56
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:14,980
If anyone gets mad at me for my pranks, they should calm down because it's just a prank. Hell, I love doing pranks

57
00:04:14,980 --> 00:04:19,220
So much, but I hate getting in trouble for my pranks.

58
00:04:19,220 --> 00:04:23,840
I got in trouble for feeding the class bird a bunch of Alka-Seltzer

59
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:29,960
So I and the teacher got mad at me, so I pranked her by replacing her daily candy with a bunch of chiclets

60
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:34,520
It's the 80s! That kind of stuff is just fun pranks right now

61
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:41,260
You know pranking small animals lighting fires wetting the bed all that stuff is pranks

62
00:04:41,260 --> 00:04:49,520
Last week I did a prank on use of DVD where I said his mailbox on fire and he was pissed I burnt his decoder ring

63
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:52,560
That's a good prank. I

64
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:59,380
Hope none of these pranks that I do now as a child affect the way I act or the decisions I make as an adult

65
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:08,460
Anyway, I'm seven years old. I'm the youngest of the group and I guess I'm the leader. I don't know. I

66
00:05:08,460 --> 00:05:13,800
Don't know why these guys hang out with me. I think I might be half brothers with one of them

67
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:16,420
I'm not entirely sure. I don't know

68
00:05:16,420 --> 00:05:20,040
I started following them around or they started following me around

69
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:25,480
Around the time that I moved into the neighborhood with my aunt after I pranked my mom and dad

70
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:33,200
Okay, so keep benefits aunt is the one who's in the house

71
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:37,960
Okay minor correction for me

72
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:40,720
Keith benefit

73
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:44,480
Has a has a few sort of a tried-and-true

74
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:51,600
Abilities he has his up close and personal attacks with his dropkick Murphy and rocks

75
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:57,360
He throws rocks as his long-range attack. He's got wicked smarts, which allows him to use

76
00:05:58,200 --> 00:06:13,000
Some fancy sort of confusing types of wording to get away with pranks using and get advantage on charisma checks and he has luck of the benefits which will get into but it is powered by beer.

77
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,500
What do you want to change that.

78
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:20,500
this originally luck of something else

79
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:24,800
and now yeah so we're moving around the table

80
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:27,900
you're playing as the

81
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:31,180
the playing as the what's his name

82
00:06:31,180 --> 00:06:34,340
fuck it up what's that there is a slice of videotape

83
00:06:34,340 --> 00:06:39,060
Robert California James Spader yeah you think is the James Spader character in

84
00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:39,700
the game

85
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:44,260
a buddy Bowser but you also started chewing on it you are you buddy Bowser

86
00:06:44,260 --> 00:07:05,260
Hello everybody, my name is Buddy Bowser. I am in 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8th grade, and I am 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13 years old.

87
00:07:05,260 --> 00:07:11,340
My doctor told me that my IQ is so low that my brain is physically unable to dream.

88
00:07:11,340 --> 00:07:15,420
He said even dogs can dream and they don't even have IQs.

89
00:07:15,420 --> 00:07:20,140
My favorite hobby is eating paste from the jar of paste that I wear on my belt.

90
00:07:20,140 --> 00:07:25,100
One time when I was eating a spoonful of paste, I tripped on a dry leaf on the sidewalk and

91
00:07:25,100 --> 00:07:27,500
the whole jar went into my hair.

92
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:32,160
After I refilled the jar, my mom had to shave off part of my bowl cut and hair doesn't grow

93
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:34,320
on that spot anymore.

94
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:39,400
at school says I look like Friar Tuck now, but I think I look more like that fat monk

95
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:45,040
from Robin Hood. My mom doesn't let me watch Robin Hood anymore because I get too scared

96
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:51,360
of Maid Marian and I pee myself. Anyway, my favorite hobby is playing tetherball and eating

97
00:07:51,360 --> 00:08:00,480
paste from my jar of paste and going to the doctor and playing tetherball.

98
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:06,080
Buddy Bowser is Mommy's special guy.

99
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:07,360
He has a couple of abilities.

100
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:13,720
He has Big Hug, which I think is my favorite, mechanically, that I've made in a while.

101
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:15,040
We'll probably just see that play out.

102
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:16,600
I don't even want to get into it.

103
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:22,120
And then Choke on Glue, which is just his ranged attack.

104
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:24,400
Also he can smell a pretty teacher lady.

105
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:25,560
There's no real benefit to that.

106
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:30,200
It's just an ability he has.

107
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:35,200
We rotate over and we see another kid who,

108
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:37,360
he's dressed in a little tux.

109
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:42,360
He seems to constantly be checking his watch

110
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:44,560
and putting his finger to his ear

111
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:47,340
and he's doing all kinds of spy stuff.

112
00:08:47,340 --> 00:08:48,340
Who is this guy?

113
00:08:48,340 --> 00:08:52,440
- The name's DVD, Yusuf DVD.

114
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:54,840
And as you may have gleaned from my pinstripe suit,

115
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:57,920
my rosewood cane and my Mickey Mouse ears yarmulke,

116
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:00,400
I am no ordinary eighth grader.

117
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:04,000
I yearn for the old days when your lawyer smoked and your cousins died.

118
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:09,080
Oh, how I dream of dialing back the calendar to years of yonder, when your best chance

119
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:13,480
of seeing a panda was not at the state zoo, but at a traveling freak show in a colorful

120
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:20,840
tent labeled "Dog of the East" or "The Bisexual Man."

121
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:25,400
Born and raised right here in Boston, California, I was trained in the accent of my motherland

122
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:30,880
by a 7 year old named Josh Gad. He had a secret from Josh and I, wherein he would show me Monty

123
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:35,520
Python Laserdiscs in exchange for loose slices of ham and the odd piece of avuncular advice.

124
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:41,200
"Hey Josh, Air Duster isn't deodorant. Stop buying wedding cakes. No one cares about your

125
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:46,760
salt lick." Through his tutelage I mastered this lilt, and I remain close friends with

126
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:52,140
him to this day. But enough about me. Everything I know I was taught by my father. He's the

127
00:09:52,140 --> 00:09:55,660
coolest guy in the whole world and there's a reason you haven't heard of him.

128
00:09:55,660 --> 00:10:01,260
He's an elder spy on her majesty's secret service, a member of the elusive Queen's Dozen.

129
00:10:01,260 --> 00:10:06,160
To this day I must spend my time parrying infiltration attempts by French PSYOP agencies impersonating

130
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:12,460
my mother on Atari Facebook, knowing full well that when I was 2 years old, my dad made her

131
00:10:12,460 --> 00:10:15,760
so horny she had to kill herself.

132
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:20,800
In the past 30 years he's been hiding in plain sight, disguised as a waiter at a British intelligence

133
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:26,700
themed restaurant working for tips from casual dining literati.

134
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:27,700
That's right.

135
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:31,460
The Royal family have been sending coded messages to his customers instructing him to do everything

136
00:10:31,460 --> 00:10:36,820
from cleanse the city's tap water supply to doing open mics under the name Paul Provenza.

137
00:10:36,820 --> 00:10:41,340
With God's blessing I will follow in his footsteps and enter the world of espionage myself.

138
00:10:41,340 --> 00:10:43,620
Youssef DVD forever.

139
00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:45,020
Amazing.

140
00:10:45,020 --> 00:10:46,020
I don't know.

141
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:51,980
YusefDVD picked up a lot of those spy moves from his dad.

142
00:10:51,980 --> 00:10:56,860
He's able to do some kung fu, spy kung fu.

143
00:10:56,860 --> 00:10:59,740
He's got a waiter's corkscrew he carries around.

144
00:10:59,740 --> 00:11:01,860
He's a couple of tools.

145
00:11:01,860 --> 00:11:07,780
He has a laser pen and some quote unquote knockout gas, which is really just sort of harmless

146
00:11:07,780 --> 00:11:10,540
gas that he has.

147
00:11:10,540 --> 00:11:14,060
And then he has, and the laser pen doesn't like burn things, it just distracts people.

148
00:11:14,060 --> 00:11:19,760
He has a packet of mysterious powder from his dad in a clear plastic bag.

149
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:22,220
He also has a gun.

150
00:11:22,220 --> 00:11:26,340
And now, to move over, and next we see someone else.

151
00:11:26,340 --> 00:11:34,500
We see sort of like a real tough guy, a real fucking bully type.

152
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:36,300
Who are you, Vince Foster?

153
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:39,340
Oh, what's up, assballs?

154
00:11:39,340 --> 00:11:40,540
Nice to feet you.

155
00:11:40,540 --> 00:11:43,260
I'm the tough kid of the school, Vince Foster.

156
00:11:43,260 --> 00:11:49,660
My mom got fingered by Edward Cigarette Hands in 1975 and 3 months later I popped out.

157
00:11:49,660 --> 00:11:53,760
Now I fuck frogs and beat up dorks who don't know their place.

158

Some think I have a secret sensitive side, and they're correct.

159
00:11:57,220 --> 00:12:01,380
It's the bottom of my smelly white ass, and it's sensitive because I hold the Guinness

162
00:12:09,860 --> 00:12:12,500

That's what I decided.

172
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,000
He has the ability to improvise with sort of any objects nearby,

173
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
to make them into arranged objects.

174
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
He can do a little whining,

175
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:44,040
uh... to to get enemies to not hurt him and he could sneak attack them will

176
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:45,640
no bully whining

177
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:46,920

So a half is like like what half of two is one oh

217
00:15:57,140 --> 00:16:05,900
Oh, I mean, I'm confused by that. I don't know how much in what direction I got really didn't think it through

218
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:17,580
the

219
00:16:17,580 --> 00:16:20,860
if you have two kids. I'm upstairs and I'm jumping on his uncle's bed.

220
00:16:20,860 --> 00:16:24,380
Yeah, you're jumping on his uncle's bed as you do.

221
00:16:24,380 --> 00:16:27,420
Each time you land on it, like a smell comes out

222
00:16:27,420 --> 00:16:31,500
that you didn't know was a kind of smell you can smell.

223
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:37,580
Keith, your aunt is very tantalizing. Does she shower?

224
00:16:37,580 --> 00:16:41,900
I don't fucking know. Why would I know that?

225
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:45,900
I give a big cartoonish smell right next to her and I go,

226
00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:47,900
No!

227
00:16:47,900 --> 00:16:52,460
I don't have time to shower, okay? I work 10 jobs, alright?

228
00:16:52,460 --> 00:16:54,460
And I raise five other kids you don't know about.

229
00:16:54,460 --> 00:16:58,220
Okay, so it's not easy being a mother. Let me tell you.

230
00:16:58,220 --> 00:17:00,220
You're not a mom, you're an aunt.

231
00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:01,280
What?

232
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:06,380
Well, I'm an aunt of children that I'm the mother of.

233
00:17:06,380 --> 00:17:09,820
Okay, it's a complicated, familial thing that us Irish do.

234
00:17:09,820 --> 00:17:12,220
You can't be a mom and an aunt.

235
00:17:12,220 --> 00:17:14,780
Yes, you can. What are you talking about?

236
00:17:14,780 --> 00:17:15,580
Wait, hold on.

237
00:17:15,580 --> 00:17:17,580
You can't be both a mom and an aunt!

238
00:17:17,580 --> 00:17:19,580
She's trying to think about it.

239
00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:20,580
[laughter]

240
00:17:20,580 --> 00:17:23,580
Wait, yes you can! Yes you can! I thought about it. You can. You can.

241
00:17:23,580 --> 00:17:25,580
You're- you're getting fucking smart, you know that?

242
00:17:25,580 --> 00:17:26,580
You better start watching that mouth.

243
00:17:26,580 --> 00:17:27,580
I'm seven!

244
00:17:27,580 --> 00:17:30,580
Yeah, that doesn't mean you're not getting fucking smart.

245
00:17:30,580 --> 00:17:32,580
I'm gonna hit you with the other side of my hand. The bad side.

246
00:17:32,580 --> 00:17:36,580
Oh, god. Alright. I guess we gotta go wake up the uncle now.

247
00:17:36,580 --> 00:17:37,580
[laughter]

248
00:17:37,580 --> 00:17:41,580
When you guys come upstairs, I have the uncle's pillowcase over my head and I'm saying,

249
00:17:41,580 --> 00:17:53,580
a

250
00:17:53,580 --> 00:17:55,580
20 years later.

251
00:17:55,580 --> 00:17:57,580
[Laughter]

252
00:17:57,580 --> 00:17:59,580
So you guys, uh, uh,

253
00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:01,580
wander outside the backyard, prodding,

254
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:03,580
poking and prodding, uh, uh, your

255
00:18:03,580 --> 00:18:05,580
little sister, Sullivan, and, uh,

256
00:18:05,580 --> 00:18:07,580

00:18:11,580 --> 00:18:13,580
Oh, he's not on a bed. My bad.

260
00:18:13,580 --> 00:18:15,580
Oh, no, you were just on

261
00:18:15,580 --> 00:18:17,580
his bed where he's supposed to sleep.

262
00:18:17,580 --> 00:18:19,580
I thought he was sleeping up there.

263
00:18:19,580 --> 00:18:21,580
No, he's out in the backyard, um,

264
00:18:21,580 --> 00:18:26,420
where he likes to hang out or you think he likes to hang out and uh, uh,

265
00:18:26,420 --> 00:18:30,700
Sullivan's going to like, you see the backyard, it's just disgusting and dirty.

266
00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:35,740
There's a pile of hay for some reason and a fish there's fucking beer and wine

267
00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:40,380
bottles everywhere. It is like way too big a property for what your aunt should

268
00:18:40,380 --> 00:18:45,140
have. Uh, but she, there's a Pontiac GTO.

269
00:18:45,140 --> 00:18:49,420
Yeah. Yeah. It's a Pontiac GTO that's in perfect condition.

00:19:29,980 --> 00:19:34,180
you guys are separate to get to his notes

285
00:19:34,180 --> 00:19:37,940
okay buddy while you're doing that role a perception check

286
00:19:37,940 --> 00:19:39,020
okay

287
00:19:39,020 --> 00:19:40,580

the okay

289
00:19:42,580 --> 00:19:43,860
you uh...

290
00:19:43,860 --> 00:19:47,820
you are unable to notice anything for the rest of your time in the backyard

291
00:19:47,820 --> 00:19:51,780
there's nothing that you'll be able to perceive it'll all just be blackness

292
00:19:51,780 --> 00:19:54,780
as far as you're concerned you essentially just have like an extended

293
00:19:54,780 --> 00:19:59,120
version of like i have a follow-up to the army i just yeah i'm close face

294
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:00,860
yeah yeah i can see

295
00:20:00,860 --> 00:20:03,940
the athlete buddy inhaled some of the uncle's breath

296
00:20:03,940 --> 00:20:08,740
passed out

297
00:20:08,740 --> 00:20:10,460
yeah uh... but but

298
00:20:10,460 --> 00:20:19,460
Yousef, I would say with your like spy sort of like abilities, you're able to pick up on a sound coming from the shed.

299
00:20:19,460 --> 00:20:22,460
Oh my god, what's that?

300
00:20:22,460 --> 00:20:29,460
Okay, you could wander over there, you can move stealthily, you can move less stealthily, it's up to you.

301
00:20:29,460 --> 00:20:31,460
I crouch walk to the shed.

302
00:20:31,460 --> 00:20:38,460
Okay, yeah. So you start crouch walking to the shed and it's pretty tough, there's a lot of like, if you're trying to like move stealthily,

303
00:20:38,460 --> 00:20:43,020
you have to like try to not step on like a beer can or a beer bottle and break it or

304
00:20:43,020 --> 00:20:51,660
some broken pottery or a magazine. So roll a stealth check. 24. Very good. Yeah, you

305
00:20:51,660 --> 00:20:57,700
from your years of of of pretending to be your dad, you're able to pretty handily like

306
00:20:57,700 --> 00:21:06,780
get to the shed, get pretty close to it. As you do, you hear like a bit of rumbling in

307
00:21:06,780 --> 00:21:21,780
the

308
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:28,780
it's shed there's like six back here

309
00:21:28,780 --> 00:21:31,220

310
00:21:31,220 --> 00:21:33,440

311
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:38,180
i know that shed the bright green shed that usually holds all of your saint

312
00:21:38,180 --> 00:21:41,360
patrick's day paraphernalia

313
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:46,360
there's one for each holiday

314
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:48,300
this is the saint patrick's day one

315
00:21:48,300 --> 00:21:50,680
the nicest shed

316
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:52,780
I have to say you guys want to do with the shed.

317
00:21:52,780 --> 00:21:54,880
I don't what are we doing?

318
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:56,680
I think follow me.

319
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:57,580
We're going in.

320
00:21:57,580 --> 00:22:02,180
Okay, so you guys are following you were yelling across the

321
00:22:02,180 --> 00:22:05,680
the if the backyard and as you were yelling you started to

322
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:08,680
hear the movement stop and as you get a bit closer to the

323
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:17,780
shed you see two little feet dangling in a big a big chest

324
00:22:17,780 --> 00:22:20,340
where there is like all this fake gold

325
00:22:20,340 --> 00:22:22,140
and also all these all this beer

326
00:22:22,140 --> 00:22:25,460
and he sees two feet dangling in your book will go to go to compare to take

327
00:22:25,460 --> 00:22:26,820
advantage of the

328
00:22:26,820 --> 00:22:29,660
willful group of people are to take advantage of

329
00:22:29,660 --> 00:22:33,540
something else my uncle's waking up

330
00:22:33,540 --> 00:22:35,500
and when you hear you hear

331
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:36,700
whatever that thing is

332
00:22:36,700 --> 00:22:38,860
here to yell he pops his head up

333
00:22:38,860 --> 00:22:39,780
and this

334
00:22:39,780 --> 00:22:41,820
rosacea

335
00:22:41,820 --> 00:22:48,700
fucking absolutely destroyed, drunken-looking, little, tiny, leprechaun man

336
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:53,740
pops his head up and he sees you, Keith Benefits, and he goes

337
00:22:53,740 --> 00:22:56,620
"HARDY TARDY HARDY HARDY TARDY HARDY TARDY!"

338
00:22:56,620 --> 00:22:59,020
"Oh my god, they shrank and cloned my uncle!"

339
00:22:59,020 --> 00:23:06,300
and he starts freaking out and he's running around, he hits into the wall,

340
00:23:06,300 --> 00:23:08,620
he passes out, and then he poof, he disappears.

341
00:23:08,620 --> 00:23:24,340
Whoa! Did you guys see that? No. Buddy, did you see that? Your uncle's nose is like chewing

342
00:23:24,340 --> 00:23:35,500
gum. Now also, Yusef, roll a perception check. Yusef and Keith, I should say. And also actually

343
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:38,220
Vince Foster, all of you can do it except buddy.

344
00:23:38,220 --> 00:23:39,380
- I got a 20.

345
00:23:39,380 --> 00:23:41,060
- Buddy can't do shit.

346
00:23:41,060 --> 00:23:42,260
- I got a 10.

347
00:23:42,260 --> 00:23:45,180
- Okay, Keith Benefits and Yusef.

348
00:23:45,180 --> 00:23:49,260
Keith, you know your backyard, you know it well.

349
00:23:49,260 --> 00:23:53,700
You know when there's something out of the ordinary,

350
00:23:53,700 --> 00:23:54,940
when there's something weird.

351
00:23:54,940 --> 00:23:59,060
It's a classic sort of tell in Boston, California.

352
00:23:59,060 --> 00:24:02,340
And Yusef, again, your spy abilities come in favor for you.

353
00:24:03,540 --> 00:24:10,260
Vince, you're too busy trying to figure out how you can suffocate Buddy Bowser on Keith's uncle's nose.

354
00:24:10,260 --> 00:24:11,700
[Vince laughs]

355
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:21,900
And you guys see a... looks like a man in like a suit, but not like a spy suit, like a FBI-looking suit,

356
00:24:21,900 --> 00:24:24,540
skulking outside of the fence, peering in.

357
00:24:24,540 --> 00:24:28,500
Oh my god.

358
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:29,700
Not him again.

359
00:24:29,700 --> 00:24:31,060
[Vince laughs]

360
00:24:31,060 --> 00:24:34,500
not the guy that watches me sleep

361
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:35,540
and uh...

362
00:24:35,540 --> 00:24:37,520
the a_t_c_'s there were you talking

363
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:39,100
uh...

364
00:24:39,100 --> 00:24:41,620
this is an instruction for me

365
00:24:41,620 --> 00:24:44,820
it's a little bit of a small

366
00:24:44,820 --> 00:24:47,060
yeah how much you go over there talk to him

367
00:24:47,060 --> 00:24:50,620
i think he may be running for a little towards the mania

368
00:24:50,620 --> 00:24:52,380
so

369
00:24:52,380 --> 00:24:53,220
there's a

370
00:24:53,220 --> 00:24:55,580
uh... and uh...

371
00:24:55,580 --> 00:24:58,540
he uh... he takes out uh...

372
00:24:58,540 --> 00:25:00,900
uh... going to freeze phrase

373
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:12,500
This FBI, and he looks like he's maybe in the FBI, but he also looks like he has like scales underneath his skin.

374
00:25:12,500 --> 00:25:19,700
It's hard to tell if he's a person or some sort of snake man.

375
00:25:19,700 --> 00:25:21,800
I take it as a challenge.

376
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:25,600
I walk up, hold the bow of the gun and put it in the center of my forehead.

377
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:27,000
Shoot me.

378
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,000
(laughter)

379
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:34,000
(laughter)

380
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:38,000
Uh, he's like...

381
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:44,000
I'm rolling intimidation check with advantage, uh, Yousef.

382
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
Okay. Oh no.

383
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,000
You are still a child.

384
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,000
So, he's just like,

385
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
"What? What are you doing?"

386
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:55,000
And, and, and, and, and sort of like,

387
00:25:55,000 --> 00:26:10,000
that

388
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:17,000
the

389
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:29,440
the

390
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:44,160
to

391
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:51,380
to go first. So this guy, this FBI guy looking guy who also looks a little bit snake like

392
00:26:51,380 --> 00:26:59,240
sort of just busted through the shed and saw Keith Benefits and he is sort of going towards

393
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:03,380
him right now. It looks like he's trying to maybe do like a sleeper hold. He doesn't want

394
00:27:03,380 --> 00:27:10,760
him to, you can't tell if it's like he's trying to kill him or hurt him just to like, you

395
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:14,760
But um, you're pretty sure that there's something going on.

396
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:18,760
So yeah, you're up Yusuf, though. That's sort of what's happening now.

397
00:27:18,760 --> 00:27:24,760
I, uh, luckily, I brought the gun my dad keeps in his drawer.

398
00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:26,760
[laughter]

399
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:30,760
To shoot at cars. Which I pull it out. Freeze!

400
00:27:30,760 --> 00:27:34,760
Okay, uh, and you have a pretty clear shot at him.

401
00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:38,760
And so, um, I'm gonna say that you can

402
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:45,400
you can roll again of intimidation with advantage before you even, but this would be your action

403
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:47,320
is to just point the gun and say freeze.

404
00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:49,080
Oh my god.

405
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:50,080
Six and three.

406
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:52,800
Yeah no, you're not very intimidating to him.

407
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:55,960
He's so, an actual gun.

408
00:27:55,960 --> 00:27:57,480
This guy got nerves of steel.

409
00:27:57,480 --> 00:27:59,640
Yeah this guy's like, that's not.

410
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:01,880
This kid has a cane, he's not shooting a gun at me.

411
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:05,720
This kid's, what are you some sort of steampunk dandy?

412
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:07,080
Get out of my sight.

413
00:28:07,080 --> 00:28:14,640
the 80s all toy guns look real true where did that's where did that stinky stinky

414
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:19,800
little man go who was in here and about yourself my uncle's right over there

415
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:27,560
oh both of you will make you mad for different reasons and and yeah it is

416
00:28:27,560 --> 00:28:36,560
though based on dexterity it is your turn Vince Foster okay I will I will use my

417
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:41,920
brass knuckles. Hell yeah, so you can run up to this guy. 21. Yeah, that's a hit. You could just...

418
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:48,400
Yes! Yeah. And I got 12. Fuck. Okay, yeah. I'm so good, dude. Yeah, so you just run up to this guy.

419
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:55,760
How do you beat down on him? One single, like, old-timey 80s movie punch.

420
00:28:55,760 --> 00:29:00,240
Just completely unrealistic. I'm like three inches away from his face and it's... Yeah.

421
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:03,660
and uh...

422
00:29:03,660 --> 00:29:07,220
pretty teacher lady. I thought that was an accident.

423
00:29:07,220 --> 00:29:08,600
okay

424
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:12,520
Buddy you smelled a pretty teacher lady. I didn't mean to click that.

425
00:29:12,520 --> 00:29:16,020
Buddy used his turn to smell a pretty teacher lady.

426
00:29:16,020 --> 00:29:21,120
You look like my teacher, she's beautiful.

427
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:25,740
But yeah, you sock him in the jaw and he's like "Ah! That was like three feet away! How'd that happen?"

428
00:29:25,740 --> 00:29:27,360
He's like freaking out

429
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:29,760
about that but he got hit pretty hard

430
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:30,840
there.

431
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:31,840
uh...

432
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:35,360
i keep benefits or is it money notes but it's your turn

433
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:37,080
uh...

434
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:39,040
you for first you smell

435
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:40,040
so then

436
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:41,680
before your old frog

437
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:46,040
little girl i was a little bit of the other guy yet the i got a good it's

438
00:29:46,040 --> 00:29:47,400
distance gap

439
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:51,400
if you're like forty feet away from him by the local and i can smell you from

440
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:54,120
here and you smell fragrant

441
00:29:54,120 --> 00:29:55,680
the

442
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:57,320
black

443
00:29:57,320 --> 00:29:59,960
you smell fragrant

444
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:02,680
You smell like- he's saying you smell like a vagrant.

445
00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:06,200
What? No, I- I- I shower plenty.

446
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:09,720
You have- you have scales like my mom's leg.

447
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:11,800
My scales.

448
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:15,920
And he starts to rub down on the scales and they sort of smooth out.

449
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:18,320
Um, and it becomes more like skin-like.

450
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:20,560
That's what my mom does too.

451
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:23,160
With her ointment.

452
00:30:23,160 --> 00:30:26,800
So what do you wanna do, buddy Bowser?

453
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:29,160
Uh, I can only move 20 feet 'cause I'm-

454
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:32,840
you can't use the ocean and i have a couple of the peace

455
00:30:32,840 --> 00:30:36,480
on the bottom i see it's really hard for me to walk

456
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:38,980
so i don't like halfway to the shed

457
00:30:38,980 --> 00:30:41,720
we could also be good news for movement though too

458
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:43,360
that's true okay

459
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:46,200
you don't do anything else except get their yeah

460
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:50,240
i quote unquote dash which is the a_s_ looks exactly the same i just walk a

461
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:53,240
little more before i stop

462
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:54,520
uh...

463
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:58,520
and meanwhile is cowering behind her passed out uncle.

464
00:30:58,520 --> 00:31:03,520
Like, "Ahh! Oh God! What is happening? I'm sore!"

465
00:31:03,520 --> 00:31:06,520
And, uh, it's your turn Vince Foster.

466
00:31:06,520 --> 00:31:07,520
Oh, not Vince Foster, sorry.

467
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:09,520
Keith Benefits, now it's your turn.

468
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:10,520
Is there anything...

469
00:31:10,520 --> 00:31:12,520
Okay, can I do like a perception check

470
00:31:12,520 --> 00:31:14,520
to see if there's anything in the shed

471
00:31:14,520 --> 00:31:15,520
that I can do a prank with?

472
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:17,520
Yeah, so, yeah.

473
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:19,520
There's... Don't even have to do a perception check.

474
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:21,520
So, it's a St. Paddy's Day shed.

475
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:23,520
So, there's...

476
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:24,520
Jameson?

477
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:26,620
There's Jameson there. Oh, yeah, there's alcohol in there

478
00:31:26,620 --> 00:31:31,420
Yeah, there's like

479
00:31:31,420 --> 00:31:37,920
Yes, oh, yeah, there's like there's like a little like a leprechaun outfit that you could you could use as a cloth

480
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:39,700
Okay, there is Jameson in there

481
00:31:39,700 --> 00:31:45,940
Most of the alcohol in here has been completely drunken though by you assume that little creature that was in here earlier

482
00:31:45,940 --> 00:31:49,480
But there is a bit there's a bit of Jameson left in like one of the bottle

483
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:55,480
I soak a leprechaun outfit in Jameson and I pull out my Zippo and light it.

484
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:58,480
Toss it at this FBI agent.

485
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:02,480
Okay, a couple of things. One, it's going to be an athletics check.

486
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:03,480
Okay.

487
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:07,480
Vince Foster, you're going to have to do a dexterity saving throw. You're right there.

488
00:32:07,480 --> 00:32:12,480
Okay. Awesome. I got a four.

489
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:13,480
Okay.

490
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:18,480
You you

491
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:23,900
Do a dexterity based attack so that'd be like your throw rocks your rocks attack just do that

492
00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:29,740
Just the rocks. Yeah, that's actually yeah instead of athletics 16. Yeah that hits

493
00:32:29,740 --> 00:32:37,960
Now that you it does get in your general area though, but it hits the FBI agent and

494
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:40,200

495
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:42,360
Guess what a Molotov cocktail?

00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:45,540
How much damage is that?

497
00:32:45,540 --> 00:33:05,540
I

498
00:33:05,540 --> 00:33:07,540
But yeah, your pant leg got a bit on fire

499
00:33:07,540 --> 00:33:10,140
from the Molotov cocktail

500
00:33:10,140 --> 00:33:13,620
And now the shed is starting to get on fire, too

501
00:33:13,620 --> 00:33:17,860
Yeah

502
00:33:17,860 --> 00:33:21,520
So, yeah, so the FBI agent now is like he's like

503
00:33:21,520 --> 00:33:24,620
He's like, you know

504
00:33:24,620 --> 00:33:29,660
Burning a bit. He got socked in the face by another kid. And so he starts panicking

505
00:33:29,660 --> 00:33:33,100
He starts to to run away

506
00:33:34,260 --> 00:33:38,920
Tries to run paths use of DVD you get an opportunity attack though Vince Foster while he's running away

507
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:42,360
Okay

508
00:33:42,360 --> 00:33:45,240
Mm-hmm. He's so he's out of the shed now. Yeah

509
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:47,800
Okay, so I will

510
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:52,040
Is there any objects in the shed that I could throw? Yeah, I mean

511
00:33:52,040 --> 00:33:59,720
Empty beer cans empty beer cans. There's like there's a blarney stone. There's a blarney stone in here, too

512
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:05,920
Is there a shuriken a shuriken? Yeah, there's an Irish shuriken. It's just a cross. Okay, I will throw that

513
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:09,920
Yeah, okay throw it really improvise

514
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:18,320
12 yeah that hits him. Yeah, this guy's not the highest five damage. Okay. Yeah you throw your cross and it's Catholic

515
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:21,520
Cross so it has Jesus on it. Yeah, it's just spinning in the air

516
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:28,120
It spins and you see you said you see it just like land in this in like the the small of this guy's back

517
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:31,980
and just like jut out Christ first.

518
00:34:31,980 --> 00:34:34,980
Um, and he's just like, "AHHHHH!"

519
00:34:34,980 --> 00:34:37,980
And just like, falls on his knees.

520
00:34:37,980 --> 00:34:42,480
And, uh, um, and Yusef, what you see,

521
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:46,980
is you see this guy disappear, and it's just his clothes remains.

522
00:34:46,980 --> 00:34:50,480
And then you see a snake slither out and slither away.

523
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:53,980
Um, past you.

524
00:34:53,980 --> 00:34:56,980
Um, the initiative's over,

525
00:34:56,980 --> 00:35:00,020
but Vince Foster you need to get out of the shed

526
00:35:00,020 --> 00:35:03,020
before I do I'm in the shed too

527
00:35:03,020 --> 00:35:07,820
you're kind of in the shed too but you're much further from where the fire that you threw

528
00:35:07,820 --> 00:35:11,420
I'm not going to say exactly what he says but

529
00:35:11,420 --> 00:35:16,980
based on the cross and the snake thing my character says something deeply anti-semitic

530
00:35:16,980 --> 00:35:21,980
and then he leaves

531
00:35:21,980 --> 00:35:23,980
*laughs*

532
00:35:23,980 --> 00:35:30,780
Just roll a... just roll... nah, I mean you could just leave the shed. It's just like lighting on fire and he's gonna fall down.

533
00:35:30,780 --> 00:35:33,780
Yeah

534
00:35:33,780 --> 00:35:40,700
But yeah, that was that was a weird thing that happened. Solvin meanwhile, she lifts her head up and she's like

535
00:35:40,700 --> 00:35:43,220
He's not waking up

536
00:35:43,220 --> 00:35:46,700
He's not gonna wake up. Can we go back inside now?

537
00:35:46,700 --> 00:35:50,620
Well, why don't we just put him next to the shed?

538
00:35:50,620 --> 00:35:52,620
*laughter*

539
00:35:52,620 --> 00:35:54,620
I don't want to.

540
00:35:54,620 --> 00:35:55,780
Maybe that'll wake him up.

541
00:35:55,780 --> 00:35:58,820
Maybe if the, maybe he smells the fire, that'll wake him up.

542
00:35:58,820 --> 00:36:02,820
Um, okay, I guess we could try.

543
00:36:02,820 --> 00:36:06,140
And did you guys, do you guys want to try to bring your uncle towards the, I've, I've

544
00:36:06,140 --> 00:36:08,980
got some, uh, I've got some powder on me.

545
00:36:08,980 --> 00:36:09,980
Oh yeah.

546
00:36:09,980 --> 00:36:11,980
You want to try to use the powder?

547
00:36:11,980 --> 00:36:12,980
Your dad's powder?

548
00:36:12,980 --> 00:36:13,980
Yeah.

549
00:36:13,980 --> 00:36:15,980
My dad has some magic powder.

550
00:36:15,980 --> 00:36:17,900
Oh, okay.

551
00:36:17,900 --> 00:36:18,900
That's a good idea.

552
00:36:18,900 --> 00:36:32,820
to

553
00:36:32,820 --> 00:36:35,900
you put the powder like in his nose you try to figure out like how does your dad

554
00:36:35,900 --> 00:36:41,180
do it and you do your dad sniffs it usually you would think but so you just

555
00:36:41,180 --> 00:36:48,140
sort of like put it up in there and you want to cover it in like spit and you

556
00:36:48,140 --> 00:36:51,780
just watch like the blood vessels you maybe they get redder you can't really

557
00:36:51,780 --> 00:36:56,300
tell and his face looks a little like it's maybe it's swelled a little bit

558
00:36:56,300 --> 00:37:01,540
more like you can't tell but he's like and he just goes like huh and like

559
00:37:01,540 --> 00:37:07,860
nothing else happens

560
00:37:07,860 --> 00:37:13,780
uh... you guys can still try to drag into the burning shed i have a better idea

561
00:37:13,780 --> 00:37:15,180
uh... so

562
00:37:15,180 --> 00:37:17,420
i'd take

563
00:37:17,420 --> 00:37:19,460
so on the map here there's a fish

564
00:37:19,460 --> 00:37:23,380
yet on the ground there's a couple of the couple of cards sort of uh... just

565
00:37:23,380 --> 00:37:24,500
never

566
00:37:24,500 --> 00:37:26,660
i'd be after when a her anger

567
00:37:26,660 --> 00:37:29,180
i'd pick up the fish

568
00:37:29,180 --> 00:37:31,360
and uh...

569
00:37:31,360 --> 00:37:35,760
I just just shoved the shoved the whole fish head in his mouth.

570
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:40,460
Okay, roll a medicine check with disadvantage.

571
00:37:40,460 --> 00:37:41,460
But do it.

572
00:37:41,460 --> 00:37:42,960
Yeah, 11.

573
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:48,540
Okay, that and I'll say plus the cocaine your uncle now is like

574
00:37:48,540 --> 00:37:52,640
trying to breathe through his mouth, but he can't so he has to

575
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:55,860
breathe through his nose that is filled with cocaine and saliva.

576
00:37:55,860 --> 00:38:00,060
And so you watch his him just like his eyes.

577
00:38:00,060 --> 00:38:09,940
shoot the fuck open and he chomps on the fish and he just starts vomiting what is looks

578
00:38:09,940 --> 00:38:12,540
like completely undigested beer.

579
00:38:12,540 --> 00:38:16,980
It's like it's completely just regular beer you could drink from it.

580
00:38:16,980 --> 00:38:17,980
It still has a head.

581
00:38:17,980 --> 00:38:18,980
Yeah.

582
00:38:18,980 --> 00:38:26,900
He vomits into like a cup like a really big mug.

583
00:38:26,900 --> 00:38:33,900
it

584
00:38:33,900 --> 00:38:48,900
in

585
00:38:48,900 --> 00:39:07,340
like

586
00:39:07,340 --> 00:39:09,760
Like that time I ate a pack of thumbtacks

587
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:13,780
He's like

588
00:39:13,780 --> 00:39:17,620
Keith where was I? I

589
00:39:17,620 --> 00:39:21,180

667
00:45:33,880 --> 00:45:37,220
The the nurse outfit was distracting me. I

668
00:45:39,820 --> 00:45:43,020
I didn't want to touch him because he was covered in too much glue.

669
00:45:43,020 --> 00:45:43,520
Yeah.

670
00:45:43,520 --> 00:45:45,820
And he looked like a girl.

671
00:45:45,820 --> 00:45:47,900
You were like, "I don't want- I hate girls with cooties."

672
00:45:47,900 --> 00:45:48,400
I'm still-

673
00:45:48,400 --> 00:45:51,660
Uh, buddy, you just fucking eat one- the coin you find.

674
00:45:51,660 --> 00:45:53,180
You just fucking eat it.

675
00:45:53,180 --> 00:45:54,380
I need more coins.

676
00:45:54,380 --> 00:45:56,300
You're not touching mine.

677
00:45:56,300 --> 00:45:58,220
You have coins?

678
00:45:58,220 --> 00:45:59,600
No.

679
00:45:59,600 --> 00:46:01,660
We don't have coins.

680
00:46:01,660 --> 00:46:06,540
I'm just lumbering towards Keith Bennefitt very slowly and ominously.

681
00:46:06,540 --> 00:46:08,540
No, I don't have a coin.

682
00:46:08,540 --> 00:46:09,180
Buddy, no.

683
00:46:09,180 --> 00:46:10,660

00:46:18,900 --> 00:46:21,360

687
00:46:21,360 --> 00:46:27,100
Yeah, buddy just eating that

688
00:46:27,100 --> 00:46:33,980
Yeah, the coin there is just a coin inside of you now. I guess we'll have to address that later

689
00:46:38,220 --> 00:46:42,580
Yeah, and so that's that's it for the for the shed though. I mean you find all the burned-down st

690
00:46:42,580 --> 00:46:45,340
Patty's Day stuff you were gonna wear to the st. Patty's Day parade

691
00:46:45,340 --> 00:46:49,440
Tomorrow, they're all tattered, but I'm still gonna wear it

692
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:52,500
Those are already tattered. Yeah, and

693
00:46:52,500 --> 00:46:55,900
I'll say at this point you guys you guys retire

694
00:46:55,900 --> 00:46:59,300
Retire for the evening unless you want to do a little bit more investigating in the backyard

695
00:46:59,300 --> 00:47:02,380
I burp and the gold coin flies out and hits Keith in the eye

696
00:47:02,380 --> 00:47:06,420
It sticks to his face

697
00:47:06,420 --> 00:47:08,420
Oh, fuck!

698
00:47:08,420 --> 00:47:11,420
It's stuck on my fucking eyebrow! I can't get it off!

699
00:47:11,420 --> 00:47:13,420
It's also covered in paste.

700
00:47:13,420 --> 00:47:19,420
Yeah, the paste and the coin on my eyebrow, like, waxes my eyebrow off.

701
00:47:19,420 --> 00:47:21,420
The shape of the coin.

702
00:47:21,420 --> 00:47:23,420
So I just have a circle of a missing eyebrow.

703
00:47:23,420 --> 00:47:26,420
Yeah, your aunt sees you later and she's just like,

704
00:47:26,420 --> 00:47:30,420
"Oh, no, I'm not dealing with one of these things you're doing now, okay?

705
00:47:30,420 --> 00:47:33,420
You gotta talk to somebody else about this!"

706
00:47:33,420 --> 00:47:38,680
I wasn't even gonna ask for any help. It looks cool. No, it's no it looks cool

707
00:47:38,680 --> 00:47:44,260
You look like you look like a fucking victim is what you look like. You look like a freak. Okay, cool right now

708
00:47:44,260 --> 00:47:50,020
You look weird. There's nothing worse than being weird. I'm going back in the back. Where's the shed? What'd you do?

709
00:47:50,020 --> 00:47:52,540
There was a shed here. There's one other shed. No

710
00:47:52,540 --> 00:47:55,340
deception check

711
00:47:55,340 --> 00:48:01,340
Great one. I know there was a fucking shed here cuz I was for st. Paddy's Day tomorrow

712
00:48:01,340 --> 00:48:03,340
Ask your fucking husband about this shit!

713
00:48:03,340 --> 00:48:03,840
Oh no.

714
00:48:03,840 --> 00:48:05,840
You see the- the uncle- the husband-

715
00:48:05,840 --> 00:48:06,340
*laughter*

716
00:48:06,340 --> 00:48:09,340
The uncle crashes his head through the window one floor up.

717
00:48:09,340 --> 00:48:10,340
"HEY!"

718
00:48:10,340 --> 00:48:13,340
"I thought you fucking said you weren't gonna fucking say anything!"

719
00:48:13,340 --> 00:48:16,340
"She was yelling at me, I didn't know what I was gonna do!"

720
00:48:16,340 --> 00:48:17,340
There's just like this-

721
00:48:17,340 --> 00:48:20,340
Three, like, this perfect triangle of like-

722
00:48:20,340 --> 00:48:25,340
Like you in the yard, her one floor down, him one floor up, yelling at each other.

723
00:48:25,340 --> 00:48:28,340
Blood vessels popping out of your necks.

724
00:48:28,340 --> 00:48:29,340
Um.

725
00:48:29,340 --> 00:48:30,340
Uh.

726
00:48:30,340 --> 00:48:35,340
But yeah, I mean, unless you want to look at the, anything else in the backyard, we could retire for the evening.

727
00:48:35,340 --> 00:48:37,340
Yeah, I'm going to investigate the backyard some more.

728
00:48:37,340 --> 00:48:40,340
Yeah, okay. You can do that. All you guys can do that.

00:48:41,340 --> 00:48:42,340
Okay.

731
00:48:42,340 --> 00:48:45,340
I guess I'm not.

732
00:48:45,340 --> 00:48:48,340
Maybe you could investigate the gold coin that was stuck to you or something.

733
00:48:48,340 --> 00:48:53,340
Oh yeah, that's a good idea. Okay. Fifteen. I investigate the coin.

734
00:48:53,340 --> 00:48:56,500
Yeah, okay. Um, I would say that for you

735
00:48:56,500 --> 00:49:00,340

737
00:49:03,980 --> 00:49:09,740

Like you start to hear like a very faint Danny boy and your eyes start to like water well up with tears. Yeah

739
00:49:22,540 --> 00:49:26,160
I could hear them singing Danny boy on the Muppet Show tonight

740
00:49:26,160 --> 00:49:31,140
Singing he sounds beautiful. Yeah, and

741
00:49:31,140 --> 00:49:36,540
Then it then it then it stops

742
00:49:36,540 --> 00:49:42,900
But you you you feel like there's something magical with this coin. You're pretty sure now

743
00:49:42,900 --> 00:49:46,180
I'll say I'm pretty sure there's something magical

744

814
00:52:59,240 --> 00:53:01,240
(laughter)

815
00:53:01,240 --> 00:53:03,240

816
00:53:03,240 --> 00:53:12,480

817
00:53:12,480 --> 00:53:16,480
out the the backseat of the SUV and there's just a dentist chair that I get

818
00:53:16,480 --> 00:53:25,440
strapped into like Hannibal Lecter. Oh sweetie I oh you just you're covered in

819
00:53:25,440 --> 00:53:31,240

He's like, I'll find out what that means in five years, honey.

Okay, deal with it then.

823
00:53:41,240 --> 00:53:47,240
We live like in the apartment above my pediatrician because we moved there.

824
00:53:47,240 --> 00:53:52,240
Make it more convenient for my mom so she doesn't have to drive me to the doctor twice a week.

825
00:53:52,240 --> 00:53:56,240
You have a, you sleep in the head of a lecher chair and like a platform.

826
00:53:56,240 --> 00:54:00,760
And your mom could just lower you down with a crank to the pediatrician's office

827
00:54:00,760 --> 00:54:06,640
And a pediatrician sees you coming down. He's like fucking God damn it again

828
00:54:06,640 --> 00:54:12,200
What did he do and it'll see like a new sales? No, he gets lowered like Mission Impossible. Yeah

829
00:54:12,200 --> 00:54:16,040
He gets lowered that way yeah

830
00:54:16,040 --> 00:54:23,600
He'll get lowered he'll be like what what happened to him you're coming down like belly first and then when you get down you see like

831
00:54:23,600 --> 00:54:24,600
a toy truck.

832
00:54:24,600 --> 00:54:25,600
Yeah, he has to replace the kid.

833
00:54:25,600 --> 00:54:32,320
Like Indiana Jones, he has to like, weigh the kid and sit there.

834
00:54:32,320 --> 00:54:35,400
He tells the kid, "Go outside, I gotta deal with this thing."

835
00:54:35,400 --> 00:54:41,360
They sit me down on one of those like, the like, the seat that's covered in like paper.

836
00:54:41,360 --> 00:54:45,120
Paper just sticks to me like a roll, just wraps around me.

837
00:54:45,120 --> 00:54:50,120
You just get, you go down like face first, onto that, and it's just stuck to your face,

838
00:54:50,120 --> 00:54:56,000
And he could see like the toy truck that's stuck in your back like like today like he's like, ah fucking

839
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:58,520
Okay

840
00:54:58,520 --> 00:55:00,200
Yeah, and

841
00:55:00,200 --> 00:55:06,280
Yeah, and so you all go to sleep in your respective houses and the next day it's st. Patty's Day. It's a big day

842
00:55:06,280 --> 00:55:09,480
But first everybody has to go to school

843
00:55:09,480 --> 00:55:13,120
Because

844
00:55:13,120 --> 00:55:17,040
Boston had a rule when they realized that they were making up too many Catholic st.

845
00:55:17,040 --> 00:55:20,880
holidays and so there's a lot of pushback and so now they have to go to school even on

846
00:55:20,880 --> 00:55:21,880
St. Paddy's Day.

847
00:55:21,880 --> 00:55:28,600
So you guys go to school and you go to class, you're all in the same class together of course,

848
00:55:28,600 --> 00:55:33,000
and of course there's always the Italian kids.

849
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:39,240
The Italian kids are these, just these awful little punks who love to bully you guys for

850
00:55:39,240 --> 00:55:46,520
not being Italian, even though that they are also the most bullied kids in all of Boston.

851
00:55:46,520 --> 00:55:49,720
and you see them sort of waddle up to you.

852
00:55:49,720 --> 00:55:52,720
And I should say all the Italians in Boston, California.

853
00:55:52,720 --> 00:55:55,800
- So I'm in their class, even though I'm seven?

854
00:55:55,800 --> 00:55:57,960
- Yeah, you're all in the same class.

855
00:55:57,960 --> 00:55:58,800
Doesn't matter.

856
00:55:58,800 --> 00:56:00,160
- Boston only has one grade.

857
00:56:00,160 --> 00:56:02,620
- It has one grade, it's called school.

858
00:56:02,620 --> 00:56:05,640
You're in the school grade.

859
00:56:05,640 --> 00:56:07,600
Yeah, you have like 30 year olds in there

860
00:56:07,600 --> 00:56:09,240
learning something completely different,

861
00:56:09,240 --> 00:56:13,040
like taking like a trade school class.

862
00:56:13,040 --> 00:56:15,160
- It's like an automotive job.

863
00:56:15,160 --> 00:56:19,880
Yeah, like there's like a car being repaired. Yeah, like a chemistry lab

864
00:56:19,880 --> 00:56:27,640
Like it just like yeah, you know, there's like the alien. Yeah. Yeah. There's a clown school too. The clown school is the largest school

865
00:56:27,640 --> 00:56:33,180
Um and all the italians in boston california are just meatballs

866
00:56:33,180 --> 00:56:39,160
They are anthropomorphic meatballs that are the size of people and they sort of squish

867
00:56:40,120 --> 00:56:42,120
To you guys

868
00:56:42,120 --> 00:56:53,540
They have to keep dodging the culinary students

869
00:56:53,540 --> 00:57:08,800
I didn't eat fucking breakfast. Oh, you didn't eat a bite cuz you're Irish you're Irish kids. You can't eat anything

870
00:57:08,800 --> 00:57:13,160
Oh, oh you guys you get up cuz you always a hungover and they all laugh

871
00:57:13,160 --> 00:57:21,160

00:57:52,760 --> 00:58:00,600
They're all strapped to like cutting boards basically like you know exam tables and wheels

905
00:59:28,220 --> 00:59:34,060
He absorbs him. No, it just it kind of hurts him but not as much as you would think because okay, because he's a meatball

906
00:59:34,060 --> 00:59:37,220
You know, hey, who did the fuck gonna throw that?

907
00:59:37,220 --> 00:59:40,540

00:59:43,260 --> 00:59:45,540
Don't hold deception. Yes

910
00:59:45,540 --> 00:59:53,440
Here I got this. Don't worry about it and I push him over. Okay. Yeah, buddy. You're face to face with this giant meatball

911
00:59:53,440 --> 00:59:57,020
And what do you what do you see? Oh, you got a problem glue boy. I

912
00:59:57,020 --> 00:59:59,020

913
00:59:59,020 --> 01:00:03,180
Yeah, he shoves you you see two little arms come out of his a

914
01:00:03,180 --> 01:00:06,940
Meatball body and just shove you back buddy

915
01:00:06,940 --> 01:00:09,500
You trying to start to something

916
01:00:09,500 --> 01:00:12,100
Yes

917
01:00:21,500 --> 01:00:27,500
Do I roll at least buddy does if everyone else wants to start fighting with the I'm

918
01:00:27,500 --> 01:00:30,260
I'm petting my pitbull and I'm naming him

919
01:00:30,260 --> 01:00:33,540
No, go to him

920
01:00:33,540 --> 01:00:37,660
E.t

921
01:00:37,660 --> 01:00:47,300
Yeah, uh, yeah, yeah so so buddy it's just you against these meatballs

922
01:00:48,700 --> 01:00:54,720
Unless anyone else wants to help out buddy. No, I give putty buddy some of the magic powder. Okay? Yeah

923
01:00:54,720 --> 01:00:57,900
Buddy, you can move twice as fast and attack

924
01:00:57,900 --> 01:01:05,760
Twice in a turn for one minute which for you because of your hug ability you guys want to start a lemonade stand

925
01:01:05,760 --> 01:01:07,760
I have a really good idea for a lemon

926
01:01:07,760 --> 01:01:18,600
So, yeah, you go first buddy you got this meatball coming at you. All right, I use my big hug ability

927
01:01:18,600 --> 01:01:31,560
the

928
01:01:31,560 --> 01:01:34,840
I see people tie it to decks, but I think it should be any... whatever, anyway.

929
01:01:34,840 --> 01:01:36,520
So! Big hug!

930
01:01:36,520 --> 01:01:40,440
Uh... oh fuck, it's doing a thing where you can't see the fucking character sheet.

931
01:01:40,440 --> 01:01:43,480
I- I can't see it on the character sheet. I sent it to you, so...

932
01:01:43,480 --> 01:01:44,680
I can read it here.

933
01:01:44,680 --> 01:01:46,200
Yeah, just read it. You know what? Fuck.

934
01:01:46,200 --> 01:01:48,440
Buddy will give an enemy a big sticky hug.

935
01:01:48,440 --> 01:01:51,080
They will be grappled, unable to move, attack, or anything.

936
01:01:51,080 --> 01:01:55,080
The enemy will take 1d6 plus strength every turn they are in Buddy's embrace.

937
01:01:55,080 --> 01:01:58,280
Buddy will also suffer half damage as long as he is embracing an enemy.

938
01:01:58,280 --> 01:02:01,640
once buddy starts hugging an enemy he will not stop because he is stuck to the

939
01:02:01,640 --> 01:02:03,300
enemy and because he is dumb

940
01:02:03,300 --> 01:02:05,080
until he squeezes the life out of him

941
01:02:05,080 --> 01:02:08,400
meaning he can do other actions only if they do not get in the way of him hugging

942
01:02:08,400 --> 01:02:09,240
an enemy

943
01:02:09,240 --> 01:02:12,520
if he bumps into any other enemies while doing this hug they can stick to him if

944
01:02:12,520 --> 01:02:16,760
they fail a DC 12 deck save meaning they will be grappled as well but will not

945
01:02:16,760 --> 01:02:18,240
suffer damage from the hug

946
01:02:18,240 --> 01:02:22,480
yeah so buddy basically hugs his meatball and is like "what are you doing? what are you doing?"

947
01:02:22,480 --> 01:02:25,320
"what are you doing?" and like he is just stuck to you

948
01:02:25,320 --> 01:02:27,580
and roll for damage on that

949
01:02:27,580 --> 01:02:31,260
five and you just squeeze you see a bit of the meatball come out of it was like

950
01:02:31,260 --> 01:02:38,220
hey hey what's the matter with you and uh uh you just now have this guy just attached to you

951
01:02:38,220 --> 01:02:47,020
um you're just hugging him big hug um uh and uh meanwhile uh the this guy can't do anything

952
01:02:47,020 --> 01:02:52,460
this guy's gonna try to come up to you but he's gonna have to roll a deck save to see if he can

953
01:02:52,460 --> 01:02:58,300
do it without getting stuck to you and well he got a crit one he is stuck to you

954
01:02:58,300 --> 01:03:04,860
hey what's the matter you hear like all of it like a chorus of it keep going this is happening i

955
01:03:04,860 --> 01:03:13,180
have i've already put a leash and i got the dog registered at the state it's now my pet pit bull

956
01:03:13,180 --> 01:03:20,860
and yep they are all stuck to you so just all these stallions failed their checks

957
01:03:21,500 --> 01:03:24,020
and they're just stuck to you while you're hugging one of their friends and

958
01:03:24,020 --> 01:03:25,580
they're like "hey, ah, oh, oh, oh, hey, hey, hey!"

959
01:03:25,580 --> 01:03:27,580
You hear all this stuff. Meanwhile...

960
01:03:27,580 --> 01:03:29,340
You guys want to go to the bathroom?

961
01:03:29,340 --> 01:03:33,460
And I just start walking to the bathroom and pulling them all along with me.

962
01:03:33,460 --> 01:03:40,220
Meanwhile, Keith, you start to hear that little Danny Boy song again.

963
01:03:40,220 --> 01:03:42,740
And you look outside the window.

964
01:03:42,740 --> 01:03:44,020
"Danny boy, Danny boy..."

965
01:03:44,020 --> 01:03:49,380
And you see a little rosy-faced little leprechaun guy.

966
01:03:49,380 --> 01:03:52,820
and he's looking over and he's sort of tilting his head back and forth

967
01:03:52,820 --> 01:03:56,180
looking over at you and he's like "hardy tardy, hardy tardy"

968
01:03:56,180 --> 01:03:58,420
he's like trying to motion you to come come to the window

969
01:03:58,420 --> 01:03:59,380
I point at him?

970
01:03:59,380 --> 01:04:00,340
mm-hmm

971
01:04:00,340 --> 01:04:01,300

972
01:04:01,300 --> 01:04:05,860
yeah he he sees you pointing at him and he's like "hardy tardy"

973
01:04:05,860 --> 01:04:09,860
and he takes out a bottle of guinness and he tips it towards your finger

974
01:04:09,860 --> 01:04:15,380
I lift up like I'm smelling like a pie in a windowsill

975
01:04:15,380 --> 01:04:17,540
and start floating towards it

976
01:04:17,540 --> 01:04:18,100

a

1027
01:09:15,200 --> 01:09:24,400
back to the battle for you to kill one Italian. Meanwhile, Yusef and Keith are flying away

1028
01:09:24,400 --> 01:09:32,080
with this little leprechaun and he's floating away with you guys and he heads over towards

1029
01:09:32,080 --> 01:09:37,680
to your house, Keith. He floats down and now you're back at your house with Yusef. He's

1030
01:09:37,680 --> 01:09:41,000
like "Heretic, heretic, heretic!" and he's like bouncing around and you see him looking

1031
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:45,880
at all the empty bottles. He's like, "Hurt it!" and he starts to drink it and he can't.

1032
01:09:45,880 --> 01:09:49,800
He's trying to find another one. You see he keeps trying to drink it and as he keeps-

1033
01:09:49,800 --> 01:09:51,680
I tap him on the shoulder. Yeah.

1034
01:09:51,680 --> 01:09:54,480
Wait, hold on. You finish. No, no, no. I was going to say, him trying

1035
01:09:54,480 --> 01:10:01,240
to drink it and you watch his agony and you start to feel it too. Like you start to feel

1036
01:10:01,240 --> 01:10:05,920
like your head starts to hurt a little bit and you start to feel a little bit like a,

1037
01:10:05,920 --> 01:10:20,440

1038
01:10:20,440 --> 01:10:22,440
Let's go inside.

1039
01:10:22,440 --> 01:10:26,440
There's a liquor cabinet.

1040
01:10:26,440 --> 01:10:30,440
Under...

1041
01:10:30,440 --> 01:10:32,440

01:10:32,440 --> 01:10:36,440
He, uh...

1043
01:10:36,440 --> 01:10:38,440
You look down and you realize he's tied your shoes together.

1044
01:10:38,440 --> 01:10:40,440
He's like, "Hurty-turty-turty-turty-turty-turty."

1045
01:10:40,440 --> 01:10:42,440
What the fuck?

1046
01:10:42,440 --> 01:10:44,440
And he's doing a little dance.

1047
01:10:44,440 --> 01:10:46,440
He starts flipping around one of those gold coins that you saw before.

1048
01:10:46,440 --> 01:10:48,440
And he's like clapping his little hands.

1049
01:10:48,440 --> 01:11:00,920

and it's empty.

1070
01:11:57,200 --> 01:11:58,880
It's fucking empty.

And you see Sullivan.

01:12:04,920 --> 01:12:05,920
There's a little bit left.

1076
01:12:05,920 --> 01:12:06,720
Yeah, sorry, go.

1077
01:12:06,720 --> 01:12:12,120
You also see Sullivan the frog is just like playing with dolls

1078
01:12:12,120 --> 01:12:13,420
and watching TV.

1079
01:12:13,420 --> 01:12:15,220
There's a little bit left in this thing here.

1080
01:12:15,220 --> 01:12:17,920
It's called aromatic bitters.

1081
01:12:17,920 --> 01:12:21,820
And you see him before you even finish saying aromatic bitters,

1082
01:12:21,820 --> 01:12:23,920
he's like swallows the whole thing.

1083
01:12:23,920 --> 01:12:25,920
And he's like, "Hurry, TK, hurry, TK, hurry."

1084
01:12:25,920 --> 01:12:27,420
He starts to feel a little bit better.

1085
01:12:27,420 --> 01:12:28,720
You can see he starts to feel--

1086
01:12:28,720 --> 01:12:30,720
He sort of grabs you by your face now

1087
01:12:30,720 --> 01:12:33,320

Terrified of you and this other one's just sort of like dead before you and when he's dead

1097
01:13:13,880 --> 01:13:16,320
He just reverts back into a regular Italian person

1098
01:13:16,320 --> 01:13:22,840
So you're just in the bathroom now, yeah, I go to the bathroom

Shit that is hitting the water is making the most insane noises

It's the toilet bowl. You see everything I ate in the past. Yeah, just like

1102
01:13:43,040 --> 01:13:46,240
coins

1103
01:13:52,640 --> 01:13:54,760
Towards the end you get a horn. Yeah. Yeah

1104
01:13:54,760 --> 01:13:58,680
The end is just like a minute

1105
01:13:58,680 --> 01:14:07,920
It's just a minute long at the like a minute long like like trumpet solo at the end

1106
01:14:07,920 --> 01:14:09,920
it's just like just sounds like

1107
01:14:09,920 --> 01:14:12,120
it's just or it's just like

1108
01:14:12,120 --> 01:14:20,640
And then I stand up and just say I want to hang out with Keith's uncle and I just leave school

1109
01:14:20,640 --> 01:14:27,640
the

1110
01:14:27,640 --> 01:14:50,640
I'm

1111
01:14:50,640 --> 01:14:52,800
Flipping a coin and like making bully

1112
01:14:52,800 --> 01:14:55,600
bully bully sounds

1113
01:14:55,600 --> 01:14:58,880
Yeah

1114
01:14:58,880 --> 01:15:02,480
And you guys eventually get back there and you see that the

1115
01:15:02,480 --> 01:15:05,200
Situation's gotten worse

1116
01:15:05,200 --> 01:15:11,640
The leprechaun is just like digging through the floors of the house. He tried to drink Sullivan. He couldn't

1117
01:15:11,640 --> 01:15:14,320
He's just doing anything he can

1118
01:15:14,320 --> 01:15:17,040
to get some alcohol so

1119
01:15:18,040 --> 01:15:25,240
Obviously Patrick you have your own beer that you I guess have been obscuring from this leprechaun. He also there's a

1120
01:15:25,240 --> 01:15:28,800
Hold on I'm gonna continue

1121
01:15:28,800 --> 01:15:35,860
To obscure the beer from him and I go out into the back and I start siphoning gas out of the GTO

1122
01:15:35,860 --> 01:15:41,000
Okay

1123
01:15:41,000 --> 01:15:43,840
I'm gonna see if the leprechaun notices you doing that

1124
01:15:43,840 --> 01:15:48,480
I'm going to say he probably does without even rolling, but I will let him give it a shot.

1125
01:15:48,480 --> 01:15:55,760
Yeah, he doesn't notice. He's craving the beer too much. He's just, he rolled that bad. So he's

1126
01:15:55,760 --> 01:15:59,840
just like, he's just like looking at you. He looks at you, buddy, and starts like seeing all this

1127
01:15:59,840 --> 01:16:04,720
stuff on you and trying to see if there's anything in there that resembles liquor.

1128
01:16:04,720 --> 01:16:11,280
I see the tiny leprechaun and I'm like, this guy is really far away from me.

1129
01:16:11,280 --> 01:16:18,080
me. He goes up to you, Yusef, and he's like trying to see if he has anything. He finds

1130
01:16:18,080 --> 01:16:22,320
a little powder. He starts to sniff it and goes, "Hardy, hardy, hardy, hardy, hardy,

1131
01:16:22,320 --> 01:16:25,840
hardy." And just like puts it, like gives it back to you, like it's not for him.

1132
01:16:25,840 --> 01:16:34,280
Thank you. Yeah. He says, "You're welcome." And he starts

1133
01:16:34,280 --> 01:16:40,160
like hardy, hardy, hardy around. He goes outside. He sees the hose and he freaks out. "Hardy,

1134
01:16:40,160 --> 01:16:47,760
He starts like freaking out when he sees the hose and scurries back inside the house and

1135
01:16:47,760 --> 01:16:53,040
now he's just like sort of feeling sick and sad and you start to feel it too Keith.

1136
01:16:53,040 --> 01:16:55,040
You start to feel whatever it is he's feeling.

1137
01:16:55,040 --> 01:16:57,200
There's like a some sort of link here.

1138
01:16:57,200 --> 01:16:58,680
I feel so horrible.

1139
01:16:58,680 --> 01:16:59,680
Yeah.

1140
01:16:59,680 --> 01:17:04,800
Oh god I feel awful and I pull one of the beers out of my pocket and I drink the whole thing

1141
01:17:04,800 --> 01:17:06,400
in like two seconds.

1142
01:17:06,400 --> 01:17:08,500
You hear it when you hear that when he hears a

1143
01:17:08,500 --> 01:17:12,680
Leprechaun

1144
01:17:12,680 --> 01:17:17,700
Like the kill bill sound like the leprechaun stories out and

1145
01:17:17,700 --> 01:17:20,600
Sees you drink it already. He's like

01:19:22,780 --> 01:19:27,580

1172
01:19:27,580 --> 01:19:31,700
drink just because it would like kill you but like that you could give to

1173
01:19:31,700 --> 01:19:49,700
to

1174
01:19:49,700 --> 01:19:51,300
is a bunch of shit attached to him, right?

1175
01:19:51,300 --> 01:19:51,800
Mm-hmm.

1176
01:19:51,800 --> 01:19:54,900
I feel like he's big enough now that he's--

1177
01:19:54,900 --> 01:19:55,400
Yeah.

1178
01:19:55,400 --> 01:19:55,900
Yeah.

1179
01:19:55,900 --> 01:19:56,900
He looks like an adult.

01:19:56,900 --> 01:19:57,900
I'm also 6'7".

1181
01:19:57,900 --> 01:19:58,400

[LAUGHTER]

1183
01:19:59,300 --> 01:20:00,800
I feel like he's not going to get caught.

1184
01:20:00,800 --> 01:20:05,000
Somebody walks in with 2,000 pounds of stuff attached to them.

1185
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:07,400
I walk into the packy, but I walk into the back door.

1186
01:20:07,400 --> 01:20:09,300
[LAUGHTER]

1187
01:20:09,300 --> 01:20:12,100
That's a real grown man move, dude.

1188
01:20:12,100 --> 01:20:14,000
You walk in.

1189
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:15,100
You see people are there.

1190
01:20:15,100 --> 01:20:17,800
They're getting their drinks because it's St. Paddy's Day.

1191
01:20:17,800 --> 01:20:19,060
They get in their drinks together.

1192
01:20:19,060 --> 01:20:29,100
You see some of them are starting to look over and like a little curious about what this giant thing is.

1193
01:20:29,100 --> 01:20:36,500
Hard to tell if it's like a, I guess it could be a fucked up boy or it could be just a fucked up man.

1194
01:20:36,500 --> 01:20:37,900
It's not easy to tell.

1195
01:20:37,900 --> 01:20:39,700
So what are you doing there, buddy?

1196
01:20:39,700 --> 01:20:42,200
You trying to get something to drink?

1197
01:20:42,200 --> 01:20:43,200
What were your instructions?

1198
01:20:43,200 --> 01:20:44,700
What did you guys tell buddy to do?

1199
01:20:44,900 --> 01:20:48,800
okay go in there and pretend like you work there

1200
01:20:48,800 --> 01:20:50,420
and you're throwing out

1201
01:20:50,420 --> 01:20:54,240
bad beer

1202
01:20:54,240 --> 01:20:56,400
okay uh... so i walk in

1203
01:20:56,400 --> 01:20:59,600
the first thing i say is i look at everybody waiting in line and the

1204
01:20:59,600 --> 01:21:00,740
workers and i say

1205
01:21:00,740 --> 01:21:02,900

I'm doing like Edward Fortyhands but with like five six-packs on each hand.

1211
01:21:19,800 --> 01:21:21,760
And I say, "This is my job!"

1212
01:21:21,760 --> 01:21:23,960
And then I turn around and walk back out of the door.

1213
01:21:23,960 --> 01:21:25,800
You're like, "Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa, buddy!

1214
01:21:25,800 --> 01:21:27,480

How did you know?

1217
01:21:30,880 --> 01:21:31,880
I just said, "I haven't seen you before."

1218
01:21:31,880 --> 01:21:32,880
I start crying.

1219
01:21:32,880 --> 01:21:36,080
I just haven't you know, I just haven't seen you before

1220
01:21:36,080 --> 01:21:45,160
Any of you guys want to do something you said vids or Keith what's happening I

1221
01:21:45,160 --> 01:21:50,220
Guy can see my dreams

1222

I

1223
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:58,600
Walk up to buddy and I say excuse me, sir. Do you know where the candy is in the store?

1224

*laughing*

1232
01:22:14,600 --> 01:22:16,600
I'm crawling around humming the James Bond theme.

1233
01:22:16,600 --> 01:22:18,600
Yeah, okay.

1234
01:22:18,600 --> 01:22:20,600

Okay, uh, Yusef, you can roll,

1236
01:22:22,600 --> 01:22:24,600

1237
01:22:24,600 --> 01:22:26,600
23.

1238
01:22:26,600 --> 01:22:28,600
You are so good at this.

01:22:38,680 --> 01:22:41,000
I've painted myself to look like

1243
01:22:41,000 --> 01:22:45,320
So, uh, uh, yeah, you are just blending in perfectly

1244
01:22:45,320 --> 01:22:49,480
So we'll we'll resolve we'll look over you in a second see what you're what you want to do with that

1245
01:22:49,480 --> 01:22:51,880
Uh vince, what are you up to?

1246
01:22:51,880 --> 01:22:56,840
Um, I can I uh stop buddy from leaving the store

1247
01:22:57,560 --> 01:23:03,400
Mm-hmm. Okay. I stopped buddy from leaving the start ago. Hey, it's me your doctor. I'm here. Oh

1248
01:23:03,400 --> 01:23:10,320
Let's see. What's this? I try and take his pulse through like a like a like a trash can lid. That's

1249
01:23:10,320 --> 01:23:15,920
Like oh, yeah, that's what I thought. I'm gonna prescribe you 50 beers

1250
01:23:15,920 --> 01:23:18,220
Okay, buddy

1251
01:23:18,220 --> 01:23:20,220
Vince roll

1252
01:23:20,220 --> 01:23:22,260
deception buddy, I

1253
01:23:22,260 --> 01:23:25,240
guess roll

1254
01:23:25,240 --> 01:23:28,120
Yeah roll insight, okay, I

1255
01:23:28,120 --> 01:23:35,500
Got a 19. I got a 13. Yeah, buddy here, you don't you know, you know Vince, you've known him for a while

1256
01:23:35,500 --> 01:23:39,160
So, you know, he's not your doctor, but you think he maybe did just help you

1257
01:23:39,160 --> 01:23:41,320
Yeah

1258
01:23:41,320 --> 01:23:47,320
Like do you think he healed you? Like what do you think? He did that? You got tricked here. I think that that he is

1259
01:23:47,320 --> 01:23:49,920
my doctor's son

1260
01:23:49,920 --> 01:23:53,980
That now because I can't imagine there could be another doctor

1261
01:23:53,980 --> 01:23:59,820
that's not related. I think all doctors are in one big family.

1262
01:23:59,820 --> 01:24:05,500
Yeah. Yeah. I should say and so I just ignore everything you said and I say,

1263
01:24:05,500 --> 01:24:13,420

and that

1278
01:25:05,000 --> 01:25:08,800
uh... you only have a couple of six back so you set if you want to keep trying to

1279
01:25:08,800 --> 01:25:10,600
get more beers to fuel

1280
01:25:10,600 --> 01:25:12,600

The pitbulls on my back by the way, oh, yeah, it's all it's all making sense to me visually

01:27:24,700 --> 01:27:26,700
(laughs)

1320
01:27:26,700 --> 01:27:34,700
Well, okay. Well, you know that Boston, California was one of the first places to legalize gay marriage, so I do accept you if you are.

1321
01:27:34,700 --> 01:27:38,700
I heard you, I heard you, Tyrone. He's like, feels a little embarrassed.

1322
01:27:38,700 --> 01:27:41,700
(laughs)

1323
01:27:41,700 --> 01:27:44,700
But, uh...

1324
01:27:44,700 --> 01:27:47,700
I turned to the rest of the crew and was like,

1325
01:27:47,700 --> 01:27:52,700
"Oh, he wants us to take him to that spot that we found the dead body!"

1326
01:27:52,700 --> 01:27:53,200
*sniff*

1327
01:27:53,200 --> 01:27:53,700
*sniff*

1328
01:27:53,700 --> 01:27:54,200
*sniff*

1329
01:27:54,200 --> 01:27:54,700
*sniff*

1330
01:27:54,700 --> 01:27:55,200
*sniff*

1331
01:27:55,200 --> 01:27:55,700
*ding*

1332
01:27:55,700 --> 01:27:56,700
That other time...

1333
01:27:56,700 --> 01:27:57,200
*sniff*

1334
01:27:57,200 --> 01:27:57,700
*sniff*

1335
01:27:57,700 --> 01:28:00,200
You know, by the trail- the railroad tracks and...

1336
01:28:00,200 --> 01:28:02,200
Kiefer Sutherland was there...

1337
01:28:02,200 --> 01:28:03,700
I just- I- I nod...

1338
01:28:03,700 --> 01:28:05,200
Yes, I remember that.

1339
01:28:05,200 --> 01:28:06,700
*laughter*

1340
01:28:06,700 --> 01:28:10,700
I- I put my hand in my pocket and I just have a finger in my pocket from that pocket.

1341
01:28:10,700 --> 01:28:13,200
*laughter*

1342
01:28:13,200 --> 01:28:15,200
It smells so bad.

1343
01:28:15,200 --> 01:28:15,700
Yeah.

1344
01:28:15,700 --> 01:28:17,700
*laughter*

1345
01:28:17,700 --> 01:28:18,200
*sniff*

1346
01:28:18,200 --> 01:28:20,200
Oh, fuck. Hey, put that back.

1347
01:28:20,200 --> 01:28:22,200
I put it back in my pocket.

1348
01:28:22,200 --> 01:28:27,200
So, you guys could get to the Brady Woods.

1349
01:28:27,200 --> 01:28:34,200
Obviously, this leprechaun can float a lot of you guys pretty far.

1350
01:28:34,200 --> 01:28:40,200
That said, you'll likely be noticed if you do that, though you can certainly still do it.

1351
01:28:40,200 --> 01:28:46,200
The other way is to go through the main street in town, where the St. Brady's Day Parade is happening.

1352
01:28:46,200 --> 01:28:48,200
You can kind of blend in there.

1353
01:28:48,200 --> 01:28:52,700
Um, those are sort of your two pathways to get to the Brainy Woods.

1354
01:28:52,700 --> 01:28:54,700
I will ride the leprechaun.

1355
01:28:54,700 --> 01:28:56,700
Me too.

1356
01:28:56,700 --> 01:29:01,700
I put a playing card in his butt cheeks to make him go faster.

1357
01:29:01,700 --> 01:29:05,700
So he makes motorcycle sounds.

1358
01:29:05,700 --> 01:29:10,700
So yeah, you all, how do you guys all configure yourself to climb onto this leprechaun?

1359
01:29:10,700 --> 01:29:12,700
I'm very curious.

1360
01:29:12,700 --> 01:29:14,700
We stand on a finger.

1361
01:29:14,700 --> 01:29:18,220
We each get a finger. I'm in a I'm in a pitbull sidecar

1362
01:29:18,220 --> 01:29:19,820
Yeah, yeah

1363
01:29:19,820 --> 01:29:23,180
I was gonna say I was gonna say we put the leprechaun on the pit and then have the

1364
01:29:23,180 --> 01:29:29,820
Leprechaun race the pitbull in the air, but I think if we each get a finger, I think that's a lot funnier. Yeah

1365
01:29:29,820 --> 01:29:32,460
I'm

1366
01:29:32,460 --> 01:29:37,820
Holding us up. Yeah. Yeah, buddy. You're somehow stuck to like the soul of your shoe like the least like

1367
01:29:37,820 --> 01:29:42,460
Least leverage you can get and grabbing on to something you are fine though

1368
01:29:43,180 --> 01:29:53,420
And you all start flying in the air, and we, even though it's like the afternoon, we see your silhouette against like, uh, the moon as you're doing it.

1369
01:29:53,420 --> 01:29:56,940
It's the most confusing silhouette of all time.

1370
01:29:56,940 --> 01:30:00,380
You don't know what it's supposed to be, looking up from the top.

1371
01:30:00,380 --> 01:30:06,540
It's like, it's like a, it's like a, guess, it's like a "Who's that Pokemon?"

1372
01:30:06,540 --> 01:30:08,940
It's for like, Tangela.

1373
01:30:08,940 --> 01:30:10,780
It could look less like anything.

1374
01:30:10,780 --> 01:30:11,580
It looks like a Rorschach test.

1375
01:30:11,580 --> 01:30:12,380
Yeah, yeah.

1376
01:30:12,380 --> 01:30:18,380
Yeah, somebody down there looks up and says, "Oh, fuck, my parents are fighting! I can't see them!"

1377
01:30:18,380 --> 01:30:19,380
[Laughter]

1378
01:30:19,380 --> 01:30:20,380
Yep.

1379
01:30:20,380 --> 01:30:32,380
Um, um, and um, uh, and uh, uh, as you're sort of flying up, uh, you hear, "Pshh!"

1380
01:30:32,380 --> 01:30:42,880
and and the leprechaun blood squirts out of the leprechaun fuck and you look down

1381
01:30:42,880 --> 01:30:51,500
and you see you see one of those snake men with a gun shooting down the

1382
01:30:51,500 --> 01:30:59,220
leprechaun I take one of my beer bottles out and I just plug I open it up and

1383
01:30:59,220 --> 01:31:03,700
plug the hole

1384
01:31:03,700 --> 01:31:08,300
so the blood is still falling out just into something it's a it's going it's

1385
01:31:08,300 --> 01:31:09,420
it's so it's like

1386
01:31:09,420 --> 01:31:12,460
the beers going into his body while blood is going into the

1387
01:31:12,460 --> 01:31:16,980
transmission

1388
01:31:16,980 --> 01:31:22,680
you start to lose altitude of that you're transfusing his blood into a beer can

1389
01:31:22,680 --> 01:31:25,620
and you see the the leprechaun is like trying to gain

1390
01:31:25,620 --> 01:31:28,040
some some leverage uh...

1391
01:31:28,040 --> 01:31:32,920
What what what do you guys gonna try to do cuz it looks like you're gonna land a little bit towards the woods

1392
01:31:32,920 --> 01:31:35,320
Right now how close to the woods?

1393
01:31:35,320 --> 01:31:40,580
I mean like kind of like where you live you live like on like right on the outskirts of town

1394
01:31:40,580 --> 01:31:45,640
So you can probably land pretty near the woods if you want to if you like like that's kind of where you were already

1395
01:31:45,640 --> 01:31:47,680
But not like in the woods

1396
01:31:47,680 --> 01:31:53,620
Like he shot you kind of a little too early cuz cuz nobody noticed him inside the inside the the liquor store

1397
01:31:57,120 --> 01:32:00,580
So I think we land near the woods, right? Yeah, you can do that

1398
01:32:00,580 --> 01:32:04,840
You can veer in other directions so you can try to drive the leprechaun in the directions. Okay

1399
01:32:04,840 --> 01:32:08,920
What if we go to the parade to try and lose the that's a good idea?

1400
01:32:08,920 --> 01:32:16,000
Okay. Oh, yeah, we can make it look like we're floating into the parade. Oh, yeah, we're afloat. Mm-hmm

1401
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:18,780
Okay. Yeah. Okay. So you guys?

1402
01:32:18,780 --> 01:32:24,760
Steer this leprechaun. I don't know why I give you guys options and into

1403
01:32:25,280 --> 01:32:27,280
the parade and

1404
01:32:27,280 --> 01:32:35,080
You see everybody sort of like dressed up as either, you know, like, you know, they're wearing kiss me. I'm Irish shirts. They're

1405
01:32:35,080 --> 01:32:41,320
Wearing kiss me. I'm Irish or something like that. I don't know. I'm drunk shirts

1406
01:32:41,320 --> 01:32:46,840
You know all kinds of stuff you see people dressed as like Irish folklore creatures

1407
01:32:46,840 --> 01:32:52,960
Well, they're wearing I'm they're wearing I'm with stupid and the arrows pointing up. Yeah, right a hundred percent

1408
01:32:52,960 --> 01:32:56,800
Yeah, name all that stuff right now, because I can't think of any of it.

1409
01:32:56,800 --> 01:33:00,000
They're there.

1410
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:02,560
They're there somehow have iPhones that have already

1411
01:33:02,560 --> 01:33:04,460
and they have the beer drinking app.

1412
01:33:04,460 --> 01:33:10,040
And yeah, you guys land in the parade in the street.

1413
01:33:10,040 --> 01:33:12,060
You see everybody there.

1414
01:33:12,060 --> 01:33:13,640
They don't really.

1415
01:33:13,640 --> 01:33:17,140
It's pretty fucking weird, but like it's it's not out of the ordinary

1416
01:33:17,140 --> 01:33:19,540
to see a leprechaun kind of looking guy.

1417
01:33:19,740 --> 01:33:23,100
You think it's just like a fucked up kid, maybe dressed up for the occasion.

1418
01:33:23,100 --> 01:33:25,780
Who just floated down from the.

1419
01:33:25,780 --> 01:33:28,260
Yeah, yeah, sure.

1420
01:33:28,260 --> 01:33:33,500
And but yeah, the snake man, you can't see where he could have been

1421
01:33:33,500 --> 01:33:34,900
or where where he could have went

1422
01:33:34,900 --> 01:33:37,540
at this point.

1423
01:33:37,540 --> 01:33:39,460
But yeah, you're in the parade.

1424
01:33:39,460 --> 01:33:42,580
You could see people having a good time.

1425
01:33:42,580 --> 01:33:44,140
What do you guys want to do in the parade?

1426
01:33:44,140 --> 01:33:48,180
There's like stands, there's like games, people just marching around.

1427
01:33:48,220 --> 01:33:50,220
Mr. Thorn, Mardi Gras beads of people.

1428
01:33:50,220 --> 01:33:51,540
Okay, yeah.

1429
01:33:51,540 --> 01:33:56,300
Uh, yeah, you throw it at a guy who looks like, exactly like Roger Clemens.

1430
01:33:56,300 --> 01:33:58,300
[Laughter]

1431
01:33:58,300 --> 01:33:59,620
Take it off!

1432
01:33:59,620 --> 01:34:01,620
[Laughter]

1433
01:34:01,620 --> 01:34:03,460
He's like, "Fuck yeah, dawg!"

1434
01:34:03,460 --> 01:34:05,460
And he takes it off, he shows his body.

1435
01:34:05,460 --> 01:34:06,540
I vomit.

1436
01:34:06,540 --> 01:34:07,700
[Laughter]

1437
01:34:07,700 --> 01:34:08,860
He's a guy, right?

1438
01:34:08,860 --> 01:34:11,300
He's been worse. I've gotten worse.

1439
01:34:11,300 --> 01:34:13,300
Um, worse reviews.

01:34:13,300 --> 01:34:15,300
Um, yeah, what else you guys wanna do?

1441
01:34:15,300 --> 01:34:16,780
What do you guys, just play around the parade.

Yeah

1452
01:35:09,940 --> 01:35:14,660
Very precocious

1453
01:35:14,660 --> 01:35:18,500
What are you doing Yusef?

1454
01:35:18,500 --> 01:35:20,340
What are you up to?

1455
01:35:20,340 --> 01:35:27,140
I've left a pitbull in a bull pit that I've seen.

1456
01:35:27,140 --> 01:35:29,300
Wait my pitbull or yours?

1457
01:35:29,300 --> 01:35:32,780
Uh yeah yours that I was riding.

1458
01:35:32,780 --> 01:35:34,980
The pitbull is just like eating the balls.

1459
01:35:34,980 --> 01:35:39,980
You see like a family of seven children going like "Come on let's play in the park!"

1460
01:35:39,980 --> 01:35:41,980
The jaws theme starts playing

1461
01:35:41,980 --> 01:35:49,260
You see like it's like the camera like gets aware like shakes a little bit and pans away as quickly as

1462
01:35:49,260 --> 01:35:54,940
And

1463
01:35:54,940 --> 01:35:56,940

01:36:34,180 --> 01:36:38,140
And you see the little leprechaun now here Wade Boggs say I would do anything

to do that series again and

1475
01:36:40,560 --> 01:36:47,120
leprechauns like territory territory deterrence arts like flipping around gold coins and doing little magic things at his hands and way Boggs like

1476
01:36:47,120 --> 01:36:49,200

Would do anything to do that series again and starts chasing the leprechaun just like to and just starts running around

1481
01:37:05,920 --> 01:37:10,640
Trying to grab him in the leprechaun just keeps dodging head of the way. He's not drunk at all

1482
01:37:10,640 --> 01:37:13,920
He's like that's a Terry like disappearing up on the tree branch on a tree branch

1483
01:37:13,920 --> 01:37:24,260
And he's like you don't understand I was supposed to get so much pussy that night

1484
01:37:24,260 --> 01:37:27,220
He's just like trying so hard to grab the leprechaun

1485
01:37:27,960 --> 01:37:37,960
Meanwhile, what are you, what are the rest of you guys doing while Patrick is dealing with this leprechaun situation?

1486
01:37:37,960 --> 01:37:44,960
Because that might ignite, you know, that might make other people aware of the leprechaun if he's teleporting around and doing magic things.

1487
01:37:44,960 --> 01:37:46,960
That's sort of the danger here in this instance.

1488
01:37:46,960 --> 01:37:50,960
I'm holding on to the side of the rollercoaster as it goes around.

1489
01:37:50,960 --> 01:37:54,960
[Laughter]

1490
01:37:54,960 --> 01:37:56,960
What about you Vince?

1491
01:37:56,960 --> 01:38:04,880
There's a I'm just cutting all the lines for all the the floats yeah, yeah the shamrock flow

1492
01:38:04,880 --> 01:38:09,880
Yeah, like everything is just going into the sky. Yeah. Yeah, you're just people in them also

1493
01:38:09,880 --> 01:38:14,280
Flying like uncontrollable hot-air balloons. Yeah

1494
01:38:14,280 --> 01:38:17,800
Yeah, yeah, we left the manual

1495
01:38:17,800 --> 01:38:22,240
We don't know how to fly any of these things. It's just the parade's just a complete chaos

1496
01:38:24,400 --> 01:38:31,980
And at this point though, it's it's the leprechauns been sort of like teleporting around like doing little tricks and stuff

1497
01:38:31,980 --> 01:38:35,460
And you see the a group more of those snake men

1498
01:38:35,460 --> 01:38:38,200
and

1499
01:38:38,200 --> 01:38:40,200
They start to approach you guys

1500
01:38:40,200 --> 01:38:46,000
And he said to chase you to say gets that leprechaun and they start trying to chase him

1501
01:38:46,000 --> 01:38:51,000
What do you guys want to do? Is there any way I can direct Wade Boggs on the leprechaun to the woods?

1502
01:38:51,320 --> 01:38:56,260
You could certainly try oh, yeah, I got an idea. Hey wait, there's a bucket of chicken in the woods

1503
01:38:56,260 --> 01:39:03,080
There's a whole whole KFC in there whole KFC dinner. You can go in there all the chicken you want

1504
01:39:03,080 --> 01:39:05,080
I know I know that's your thing. Oh

1505
01:39:05,080 --> 01:39:09,040
Roll persuasion with advantage because you said that

1506
01:39:09,040 --> 01:39:12,960
16

1507
01:39:12,960 --> 01:39:16,520
He he who's wanted to who he wanted to

1508
01:39:17,840 --> 01:39:23,440
He stops chasing the leprechaun he's getting kind of winded. He's already sort of becoming the age he is now and

1509
01:39:23,440 --> 01:39:26,600
He's like fucking chicken

1510
01:39:26,600 --> 01:39:33,220
He just starts to wander off towards the woods and the leprechaun he wants to keep tricking Wade starts following him and and it's like

1511
01:39:33,220 --> 01:39:39,080
Poking at him and prodding him and the snake guys are chasing after him too. And you guys are running into the woods

1512
01:39:39,080 --> 01:39:43,100
Is there any way I can make Wade go? I know I can I make Wade go faster

1513
01:39:43,100 --> 01:39:47,100
So the leprechaun goes faster. So the snake men. Yeah, what do you want to try to do?

1514
01:39:47,100 --> 01:39:53,960
Uh, if you catch the leprechaun Wade, you're gonna need to eat a whole bucket of chicken before the game to redo the series

1515
01:39:53,960 --> 01:39:57,240
And oh, that's a good point. It's chickens my fuel

1516
01:39:57,240 --> 01:40:02,080
Superstition. Yeah, that's my see. That's why I look like this soon

1517
01:40:02,080 --> 01:40:10,460
He's like moving a little bit faster now and you guys almost lose snake guys, I'll have you roll all you guys roll

1518
01:40:13,460 --> 01:40:17,940
Let's have you all roll nature checks actually to see if you could sort of hide in the woods if you know your way around

1519
01:40:17,940 --> 01:40:22,060
Critical got a crit

1520
01:40:22,060 --> 01:40:28,720
Do I count which one do I count I accidentally rolled with advantage? Oh the first one. Sorry damn six

1521
01:40:28,720 --> 01:40:30,720
Okay, a couple of things

1522
01:40:30,720 --> 01:40:35,220
Keith you got Keith and buddy. You have a regular relationship with the Brady woods

1523
01:40:35,220 --> 01:40:37,980
Nothing special that you know about it

1524
01:40:39,020 --> 01:40:43,980
Yousef you're particularly unversed in these woods. Why do you think that is? I want to know

1525
01:40:43,980 --> 01:40:50,140
What makes yousef have a hard time navigating the woods 70% of my time is spent inside a trunk

1526
01:40:50,140 --> 01:40:57,100
Yeah, yeah your dad's like your dad like also doesn't want you to go into the woods

1527
01:40:57,100 --> 01:41:02,540
Yeah, i'm not my dad doesn't like the outside because you know, the rain has tap water in it and he doesn't want me

1528
01:41:02,540 --> 01:41:05,260
Yeah

1529
01:41:07,180 --> 01:41:13,180
And uh, uh you uh, vince, uh that crit is going to be very helpful for you. What what?

1530
01:41:13,180 --> 01:41:17,100
Why do you know your way around the woods? So well vince foster the bully

1531
01:41:17,100 --> 01:41:24,460
Um as soon as I like get into the woods it it immediately becomes like a snow white situation and all the uh,

1532
01:41:24,460 --> 01:41:26,620
Woodland creatures come out and I start singing

1533
01:41:26,620 --> 01:41:29,260
In a beautiful girl voice

1534
01:41:29,260 --> 01:41:32,380
And I realize it's like the only happiness i've ever had in my life

1535
01:41:34,460 --> 01:41:40,620
Yeah, there's a connection in nature. Yeah, you see like the rabbits are like have like big eyelashes and they're like

1536
01:41:40,620 --> 01:41:45,820
Doing silly little like scurry things around you and and they're they're giving you like

1537
01:41:45,820 --> 01:41:51,820
They're giving you little outfits to wear try on they're helping you sew something right now. Yeah. Yeah

1538
01:41:51,820 --> 01:41:58,140
Uh, but your your knowledge around the woods helps sort of lift everybody else out of it and you guys managed to get

1539
01:41:58,140 --> 01:41:59,900
um

1540
01:41:59,900 --> 01:42:01,260
uh to

1541
01:42:01,260 --> 01:42:02,780
What looks like?

1542
01:42:02,780 --> 01:42:03,780
you know

1543
01:42:03,780 --> 01:42:05,220
who are magical

1544
01:42:05,220 --> 01:42:06,940
part of gold

1545
01:42:06,940 --> 01:42:10,500
on the car and you see way bogs is like

01:42:10,500 --> 01:42:12,140

01:42:12,140 --> 01:42:14,220
and uh... the leprechauns like

1548
01:42:14,220 --> 01:42:16,140
and he looks up

1549
01:42:16,140 --> 01:42:17,500
he's like pointing up

1550
01:42:17,500 --> 01:42:20,860
and he's like you see way off in the distance from the rainbow that part of

1551
01:42:20,860 --> 01:42:23,580
gold is on this magical saint patrick's day

1552
01:42:23,580 --> 01:42:27,180
a few little leprechauns sliding down

1553
01:42:27,180 --> 01:42:28,580
maybe towards

1554
01:42:28,580 --> 01:42:31,740
the pot of gold

1555
01:42:31,740 --> 01:42:33,900
before anything can happen

1556
01:42:33,900 --> 01:42:36,140
you also see

1557
01:42:36,140 --> 01:42:38,400
a

1558
01:42:38,400 --> 01:42:40,060
some of people been waiting here

1559
01:42:40,060 --> 01:42:41,520

1560
01:42:41,520 --> 01:42:44,200
is none other than the the greatest snake

1561
01:42:44,200 --> 01:42:48,280
in in boston history

1562
01:42:48,280 --> 01:42:50,460
roger fucking clemens

1563
01:42:50,460 --> 01:42:54,000
who left the socks to join

1564
01:42:54,000 --> 01:42:55,160
the yankees

1565
01:42:55,160 --> 01:43:00,100
my mom went to dinner with him once

1566
01:43:00,100 --> 01:43:02,100
and his snakes

1567
01:43:02,100 --> 01:43:05,300
Because he's a fucking snake

1568
01:43:05,300 --> 01:43:07,540
and he says

1569
01:43:07,540 --> 01:43:13,300
He says to you all finally the leprechaun i'm roger clemens. I don't think I sound like this

1570
01:43:13,300 --> 01:43:21,080
I think roger clemens is from like texas or yeah, right disney. Yeah. Yee-haw. My name is roger clemens

1571
01:43:21,080 --> 01:43:26,020
I fucking hate boston california. Oh, he's from ohio

1572
01:43:26,020 --> 01:43:28,580
and uh

1573
01:43:28,580 --> 01:43:33,140
And I have a disorder.

1574
01:43:33,140 --> 01:43:34,740
Um, just looked it up.

1575
01:43:34,740 --> 01:43:38,780
He's from trench town and I live in a hole.

1576
01:43:38,780 --> 01:43:46,860
I go back up and, um, you see, he says once long ago, St.

1577
01:43:46,860 --> 01:43:52,220
Patrick banished these snakes from all of Ireland and from Boston, California.

1578
01:43:52,220 --> 01:43:56,460
I'm bringing the snakes back one leprechaun dead at a time.

1579
01:43:56,460 --> 01:43:58,220
Give me that leprechaun.

1580
01:43:58,220 --> 01:44:01,720
No! Wait, hold on, I've got an idea.

1581
01:44:01,720 --> 01:44:02,720
Are we all here now?

1582
01:44:02,720 --> 01:44:05,720
Yeah, you're all here, I just haven't put your icons in yet.

1583
01:44:05,720 --> 01:44:07,720
What's a leprechaun?

1584
01:44:07,720 --> 01:44:10,720
You talking about that midget that says "tard" all the time?

1585
01:44:10,720 --> 01:44:12,720
[Laughter]

1586
01:44:12,720 --> 01:44:16,720
Yeah, he says "hardy, tardy, how do I sound?"

1587
01:44:16,720 --> 01:44:20,720
Roger Clements. He's just like freaking out.

1588
01:44:20,720 --> 01:44:24,720
Oh, those are the wrong characters. Sorry.

1589
01:44:24,720 --> 01:44:27,520
Uh, yeah, but you guys are all here now.

1590
01:44:27,520 --> 01:44:32,720
Um, I was gonna say roll initiative against Roger Cogman's and the snakes, but if you guys

1591
01:44:32,720 --> 01:44:35,640
have a few more words to share, anyone want to step on that?

1592
01:44:35,640 --> 01:44:38,360
Uh, I think the leprechaun is more sad.

1593
01:44:38,360 --> 01:44:39,360
Yeah.

1594
01:44:39,360 --> 01:44:43,080
Are you, I'm talking, I'm talking to Roger.

1595
01:44:43,080 --> 01:44:44,880
Are you my mom?

1596
01:44:44,880 --> 01:44:46,880
Oh shit.

1597
01:44:46,880 --> 01:44:49,680
Uh, no kid, I'm not your mom.

1598
01:44:49,680 --> 01:44:52,040
Are you my teacher?

1599
01:44:52,040 --> 01:44:53,040
I'm about to teach you a lesson.

1600
01:44:53,040 --> 01:44:55,040
Are you my mom's friend?

1601
01:44:55,040 --> 01:44:55,540
Alright, so this is-

1602
01:44:55,540 --> 01:44:57,040
Are you my teacher's friend?

1603
01:44:57,040 --> 01:44:58,040
You're doing a thing?

1604
01:44:58,040 --> 01:44:58,540
This is a thing you do?

1605
01:44:58,540 --> 01:45:00,040
Are you my mom's teacher?

1606
01:45:00,040 --> 01:45:02,040
Did somebody tell this kid to

1607
01:45:02,040 --> 01:45:02,540
fucking shut the fuck up?

1608
01:45:02,540 --> 01:45:04,040
Are you my teacher's mom?

1609
01:45:04,040 --> 01:45:04,540
I'm gonna tell-

1610
01:45:04,540 --> 01:45:07,040
Well answer his fucking questions, you prick!

1611
01:45:07,040 --> 01:45:08,040
No, you're a prick.

1612
01:45:08,040 --> 01:45:10,040
God, I'm so mad at you right now.

1613
01:45:10,040 --> 01:45:12,040
I whispered to Keith,

1614
01:45:12,040 --> 01:45:15,040
"That's my teacher's mom's friend."

1615
01:45:15,040 --> 01:45:17,040
*laughter*

1616
01:45:17,040 --> 01:45:19,040
Yes he is, buddy. Yes he is.

1617
01:45:19,040 --> 01:45:21,040
And, uh, yeah, you all wrote an initiative?

1618
01:45:21,040 --> 01:45:32,320
initiative. Okay. Shit. Okay. Wow. Okay. Cool. Um, okay. Yeah. All right. And so, uh, Keith,

1619
01:45:32,320 --> 01:45:37,640
you got to go first against Roger Clemens and his snakes as they wait by the rainbow.

1620
01:45:37,640 --> 01:45:44,760
Yeah. All right. I think I'm going to use wicked smots on him. All right. So if you

1621
01:45:44,760 --> 01:46:02,640
is

1622
01:46:02,640 --> 01:46:06,640
I'm gonna try and convince him to go back to the Red Sox.

1623
01:46:06,640 --> 01:46:08,640
[Laughter]

1624
01:46:08,640 --> 01:46:10,640
Okay, go for it.

1625
01:46:10,640 --> 01:46:12,640
Alright.

1626
01:46:12,640 --> 01:46:18,640
I open up just like one of the Guinness that we took from the Leprechaun.

1627
01:46:18,640 --> 01:46:20,640
I chug the whole thing in front of him.

1628
01:46:20,640 --> 01:46:22,640
And I just start talking like,

1629
01:46:22,640 --> 01:46:24,640
"Fuckin' listen to me, kid.

1630
01:46:24,640 --> 01:46:26,640
Fuckin' listen, dude.

1631
01:46:26,640 --> 01:46:28,640

1636
01:46:36,640 --> 01:46:38,640
I forgot Wade Boggs

1637
01:46:38,640 --> 01:46:40,640

01:46:40,640 --> 01:46:42,640

and I'm the coach of the team

Did a prank on her right that's what you said he did a crazy prank

1666
01:48:02,740 --> 01:48:11,000
And that's your turn and how it's a project Clemens and his snakes turn. So Roger Clemens, so that did nothing. No, I did shit

1667
01:48:11,000 --> 01:48:12,440
Yeah

1668
01:48:12,440 --> 01:48:14,440
so Roger Clemens is gonna

1669
01:48:14,440 --> 01:48:16,720
throws a fastball at

1670
01:48:16,720 --> 01:48:18,560
at

1671
01:48:18,560 --> 01:48:19,840
you

1672
01:48:19,840 --> 01:48:21,840
Keith after that attempt

1673
01:48:21,840 --> 01:48:25,520
And that hits you and it does

1674
01:48:25,520 --> 01:48:28,760
Yeah, this is the only real fight

1675
01:48:28,760 --> 01:48:33,040
It does 11 damage to you

1676
01:48:33,040 --> 01:48:38,560
And he's gonna wind up another fastball and throw it at you

1677
01:48:38,560 --> 01:48:47,480
Vince he's he is not even gonna try to attack buddy. I'm totally scared of him

1678
01:48:48,960 --> 01:48:56,100
Let's see. Can I use my my deflection ability now? Yes, I forgot. Yeah, so you can use your your your leather jacket to deflect this

1679
01:48:56,100 --> 01:48:59,120
Okay, so roll d20. All right

1680
01:48:59,120 --> 01:49:00,720
14

1681
01:49:00,720 --> 01:49:07,880
Yeah, you deflect it. You can just deflect projectiles. So you deflect this baseball. It just goes flying off into the sky

1682
01:49:07,880 --> 01:49:10,800
with your cool leather jacket

1683
01:49:10,800 --> 01:49:16,680
And now the snakes are gonna come after you guys, so they're all like hissing away

1684
01:49:17,320 --> 01:49:20,040
They're there and they're going after

1685
01:49:20,040 --> 01:49:25,480
Yousef first because they see he's they see he's English and they have a certain

1686
01:49:25,480 --> 01:49:27,920
thing about that

1687
01:49:27,920 --> 01:49:30,800
and so I saw I'm okay, so there's a

1688
01:49:30,800 --> 01:49:33,720
dilapidated office chair

1689
01:49:33,720 --> 01:49:35,280
sort of on

1690
01:49:35,280 --> 01:49:40,320
The perimeter of the action. Yeah. Yeah, I can see me. Yeah, it turns around

1691
01:49:40,320 --> 01:49:43,440
Stroking a gun like a cat

1692
01:49:43,440 --> 01:49:45,440
*laughter*

1693
01:49:45,440 --> 01:49:51,440
Okay, um, let's see if the snakes understand what you're doing.

1694
01:49:51,440 --> 01:49:53,440
Uh... uh...

1695
01:49:53,440 --> 01:49:57,440
Let me see if they understand it.

1696
01:49:57,440 --> 01:49:59,440
Oh, do we have the pitbull with us?

1697
01:49:59,440 --> 01:50:01,440
Yeah, you do.

1698
01:50:01,440 --> 01:50:05,440
The snakes don't understand, like, what a gun is, so they're not scared of you yet.

1699
01:50:05,440 --> 01:50:08,440
Um, they can't even, like, be intimidated, but...

1700
01:50:08,440 --> 01:50:10,440
Um, they're gonna try to attack you.

1701
01:50:10,440 --> 01:50:12,440
Let's see how they do.

1702
01:50:12,440 --> 01:50:16,440
Uh, one of them hits you for...

1703
01:50:16,440 --> 01:50:20,440
Alright, he hits you for 7 damage, the other two snap at you and miss you.

1704
01:50:20,440 --> 01:50:24,440
And also you're a little bit... you feel your legs swell up a little bit.

1705
01:50:24,440 --> 01:50:28,440
Um, and that might be a problem down the line.

1706
01:50:28,440 --> 01:50:32,440
This last snake is gonna go for you, buddy.

1707
01:50:32,440 --> 01:50:35,440
Um, he's gonna try to chomp into you.

1708
01:50:35,440 --> 01:50:41,440
And he does manage to pierce your... your... your Katamari Damacy shield.

1709
01:50:41,440 --> 01:50:43,440
and do

1710
01:50:43,440 --> 01:50:45,740
For damage to you just like bite your leg

1711
01:50:45,740 --> 01:50:50,480
And you also see your leg to get this wall up a little bit. Yeah

1712
01:50:50,480 --> 01:50:54,640
But now it is your turn

1713
01:50:54,640 --> 01:50:57,680
Buddy, it's your turn

1714
01:50:57,680 --> 01:51:02,640
It's my turn. I got a one. Oh, you got one. Oh, sorry Leo. It's your turn you Seth. It's your turn

1715
01:51:02,640 --> 01:51:04,640

1716
01:51:04,640 --> 01:51:06,600

1717
01:51:06,600 --> 01:51:13,780

*laughter*

1727
01:51:37,440 --> 01:51:39,440
He blows brains out.

1728
01:51:39,440 --> 01:51:41,440
Roll for damage.

1729
01:51:41,440 --> 01:51:43,440
That hits him.

1730
01:51:43,440 --> 01:51:45,440
*laughter*

1731
01:51:45,440 --> 01:51:47,440
*laughter*

1732
01:51:47,440 --> 01:51:49,440
*laughter*

1733
01:51:49,440 --> 01:51:51,440

1734
01:51:51,440 --> 01:51:53,440
*laughter*

1735
01:51:53,440 --> 01:51:55,440
Shoot a man

He takes a shit ton of damage he looks so fucked up like oh my god

1737
01:52:01,680 --> 01:52:09,640
Hey, you shoot him. You swear. Where did you shoot him use this without killing him in this sort of stomach?

1738
01:52:09,640 --> 01:52:13,480
This is coming. Okay. You shot him in the stomach. He's bursted his kidney. Yeah

1739
01:52:13,480 --> 01:52:17,800
I didn't know the boy had a gun. Oh

1740
01:52:17,800 --> 01:52:20,760
my god, I

1741
01:52:21,320 --> 01:52:28,400
Start like screaming and crying because my my dreams of becoming the coach of the Red Sox with Roger Clemens and Wade Boggs

1742
01:52:28,400 --> 01:52:30,400
I thought I could still do it

1743
01:52:30,400 --> 01:52:39,280
It's like less of a battle now and everyone's just freaking out

1744
01:52:39,280 --> 01:52:50,920
When I see him get shot I just go I'm going to take you to the doctor and I just start walking towards him like Michael

1745
01:52:50,920 --> 01:52:52,920
*laughter*

1746
01:52:52,920 --> 01:52:54,920
*laughter*

1747
01:52:54,920 --> 01:52:56,920

1748
01:52:56,920 --> 01:52:58,920
um, yeah and it is uh

1749
01:52:58,920 --> 01:53:00,920
uh, uh

1750
01:53:00,920 --> 01:53:02,920
I forgot to give you like a down time

1751
01:53:02,920 --> 01:53:04,920
after the cocaine thing but

1752
01:53:04,920 --> 01:53:06,920
it's fine, uh

1753
01:53:06,920 --> 01:53:08,920
yeah you said- you do that

1754
01:53:08,920 --> 01:53:10,920
the snakes actually like take a second

1755
01:53:10,920 --> 01:53:12,920
to go "whoa" like

1756
01:53:12,920 --> 01:53:14,920
they- just the snakes

1757
01:53:14,920 --> 01:53:16,920
internally realize that something

1758
01:53:16,920 --> 01:53:18,920
the vibe is different like

1759
01:53:18,920 --> 01:53:26,640
A gun was introduced into this.

1760
01:53:26,640 --> 01:53:29,560
It is, let's see, initiative.

1761
01:53:29,560 --> 01:53:32,880
Oh yeah, sorry, it's your turn Vince.

1762
01:53:32,880 --> 01:53:33,880
Vince Foster.

1763
01:53:33,880 --> 01:53:39,160
Okay, buddy, what's the biggest thing that has stuck to you?

1764
01:53:39,160 --> 01:53:45,520
There's a giant piece of drywall on my back like a turtle shell.

1765
01:53:45,520 --> 01:53:48,640
i use my improvised ability to pick it up and and throw it

1766
01:53:48,640 --> 01:53:50,240
hit you okay me too

1767
01:53:50,240 --> 01:53:51,120
the head

1768
01:53:51,120 --> 01:53:55,300
uh... i just roll roll a straight check just 'cause it's a bit bigger but a

1769
01:53:55,300 --> 01:53:59,720
regular improvised and a

1770
01:53:59,720 --> 01:54:01,200
nice now

1771
01:54:01,200 --> 01:54:06,440
if tolerant and yet you're fine you're able to throw this thing night uh... so

1772
01:54:06,440 --> 01:54:09,600
you have to move a bit closer to hit clemens

1773
01:54:09,600 --> 01:54:10,980
if you try to clemens

1774
01:54:10,980 --> 01:54:14,400
yeah all the clemens l all of them

1775
01:54:14,400 --> 01:54:19,400
I will grab it and then kind of do like a roll with buddy's body and then throw the entire

1776
01:54:19,400 --> 01:54:20,400
thing at him.

1777
01:54:20,400 --> 01:54:24,600
Okay, and so that's going to do that's so much stuff.

1778
01:54:24,600 --> 01:54:33,520
So don't roll just roll your attack for improvise like four times to see how much damage you

1779
01:54:33,520 --> 01:54:34,520
do.

1780
01:54:34,520 --> 01:54:38,760
Okay, so that's just after you but first do an improvise attack because you can lift her

1781
01:54:38,760 --> 01:54:40,360
and see if you can hit them.

1782
01:54:40,360 --> 01:54:41,360
14.

1783
01:54:41,360 --> 01:54:44,320
Yeah, that's that's that's that's going to beat his AC.

1784
01:54:44,320 --> 01:54:57,800
is

1785
01:54:57,800 --> 01:55:09,800
this

1786
01:55:09,800 --> 01:55:16,800

1787
01:55:16,800 --> 01:55:20,280
Yeah, you just say you smell good

1788
01:55:20,280 --> 01:55:31,000
Yes

1789
01:55:31,000 --> 01:55:38,760
Good as this terrible boy starts flying towards him the snakes are still here

1790
01:55:38,760 --> 01:55:43,000
Then the snakes still

1791
01:55:43,000 --> 01:55:45,880
Want to

1792
01:55:45,960 --> 01:55:53,180
Take back Ireland or Boston, California, so you can still you still have to fight that but Roger Clemens is dead

1793
01:55:53,180 --> 01:55:57,000
Well while Roger Clemens is dead

1794
01:55:57,000 --> 01:56:02,420
I go up to him and I take his Red Sox hat and I put it on and I say I think I'm gonna change

1795
01:56:02,420 --> 01:56:04,420

1813
01:57:29,760 --> 01:57:31,840
uh

1814
01:57:31,840 --> 01:57:34,640
And uh, yeah, it is now it's gonna be the snake's turn

1815
01:57:34,640 --> 01:57:37,120
so one of them

1816
01:57:37,120 --> 01:57:38,080
it

1817
01:57:38,080 --> 01:57:40,560
Let's see. What's his movement? Yeah, his movement I gave him was

1818
01:57:40,560 --> 01:57:43,200
I gave him like 35. Yeah

1819
01:57:43,200 --> 01:57:45,360
So they're they're gonna try to chase after you

1820
01:57:45,360 --> 01:57:48,960
Because you're putting the coin back. This one is still gonna try to fight you yousef

1821
01:57:48,960 --> 01:57:51,600
Um, he's gonna rear his head back

1822
01:57:52,480 --> 01:57:56,160
and uh... you're gonna see that uh... his teeth are green

1823
01:57:56,160 --> 01:57:58,200
thirty-eight irish green

1824
01:57:58,200 --> 01:58:00,040
you get ready to ask you

1825
01:58:00,040 --> 01:58:01,880
and uh...

1826
01:58:01,880 --> 01:58:03,840
the it he does it you

1827
01:58:03,840 --> 01:58:05,960
uh... he's a phone call

1828
01:58:05,960 --> 01:58:07,240
uh...

1829
01:58:07,240 --> 01:58:08,600
and he does

1830
01:58:08,600 --> 01:58:11,040
is nine damage to you so

1831
01:58:11,040 --> 01:58:14,440
you took would you take before you do you get you took

1832
01:58:14,440 --> 01:58:16,000
uh...

1833
01:58:16,000 --> 01:58:18,280
they have it over here so eleven

1834
01:58:18,280 --> 01:58:19,800
it eleven

1835
01:58:19,800 --> 01:58:21,800
and now you took nine

1836
01:58:21,800 --> 01:58:25,760
So you're at, uh, uh, Oh, you're dead.

1837
01:58:25,760 --> 01:58:26,840
You you're knocked out.

1838
01:58:26,840 --> 01:58:28,460
You said it was knocked out cold.

1839
01:58:28,460 --> 01:58:31,660
Uh, we're going to start doing death saving throws for you.

1840
01:58:31,660 --> 01:58:38,320
So, uh, uh, um, and, uh, it is now.

1841
01:58:38,320 --> 01:58:40,320
You Seth's turn too.

1842
01:58:40,320 --> 01:58:42,360
So you Seth rolled a D 20.

1843
01:58:42,360 --> 01:58:43,280
Okay.

1844
01:58:43,280 --> 01:58:44,840
You take one failure.

1845
01:58:44,840 --> 01:58:48,080
So you're slowly approaching death because of these snakes.

1846
01:58:48,080 --> 01:58:50,760
What do you see as death approaches you?

1847
01:58:50,760 --> 01:58:51,520
You're not dead yet.

1848
01:58:51,640 --> 01:58:53,640
What do you see?

1849
01:58:53,640 --> 01:59:01,640
I see in the distance a pitbull running towards the area.

1850
01:59:01,640 --> 01:59:10,640
Okay, yeah, you see your pitbull. You're like blinking in and out, like slowly blinking, and you see this ever faithful pitbull.

1851
01:59:10,640 --> 01:59:18,640
It has just like blood on it. Yeah, human leg in its mouth. It's like a ball pitbull.

1852
01:59:18,640 --> 01:59:43,640
I'm

1853
01:59:43,640 --> 01:59:46,200
penis hurts 'cause it's so big.

1854
01:59:46,200 --> 01:59:47,400
(laughing)

1855
01:59:47,400 --> 01:59:49,960
Oh, fuck me.

1856
01:59:49,960 --> 01:59:52,860
Ow, it's growing, ow.

1857
01:59:52,860 --> 01:59:57,320
- I guess we're all deception, yeah, on the snake.

1858
01:59:57,320 --> 01:59:58,160
- Oh, I'm being for real.

1859
01:59:58,160 --> 01:59:58,980
- Or no, what is it?

1860
01:59:58,980 --> 01:59:59,820
No, I roll against it, sorry.

1861
01:59:59,820 --> 02:00:01,200
The snake's charisma.

1862
02:00:01,200 --> 02:00:03,480
Technically, what you usually do in D&D,

1863
02:00:03,480 --> 02:00:05,880
when a creature can't even perceive that kind of thing,

1864
02:00:05,880 --> 02:00:07,080
you just don't.

1865
02:00:07,080 --> 02:00:10,400
But in this game, the snake can maybe tell

1866
02:00:10,400 --> 02:00:11,660
when somebody's in pain.

1867
02:00:12,840 --> 02:00:14,840
and he's very worried about you

1868
02:00:14,840 --> 02:00:16,840
he should be dude

1869
02:00:16,840 --> 02:00:18,840
it's sort of like

1870
02:00:18,840 --> 02:00:20,840
like quietly

1871
02:00:20,840 --> 02:00:22,840
and sweetly sort of like slithers over

1872
02:00:22,840 --> 02:00:24,840
to you and tries to look at your

1873
02:00:24,840 --> 02:00:26,840
penis to see if everything's okay

1874
02:00:26,840 --> 02:00:28,840
what the hell? get the fuck off me

1875
02:00:28,840 --> 02:00:30,840
yeah you just

1876
02:00:30,840 --> 02:00:32,840
punch it i guess yeah so

1877
02:00:32,840 --> 02:00:34,840
roll with advantage and attack on the snake

1878
02:00:34,840 --> 02:00:36,840
what do i roll?

1879
02:00:36,840 --> 02:00:38,840
with brass knuckles oh ok

1880
02:00:38,840 --> 02:00:40,840
mhm

1881
02:00:40,840 --> 02:00:45,840
Yeah, you hit and then roll that what you roll and then plus two more d6 after.

1882
02:00:45,840 --> 02:00:46,840
Okay.

1883
02:00:46,840 --> 02:00:47,840
Yeah.

1884
02:00:47,840 --> 02:00:48,840
Thirteen.

1885
02:00:48,840 --> 02:00:49,840
I mean, yeah.

1886
02:00:49,840 --> 02:00:50,840
Six.

1887
02:00:50,840 --> 02:00:53,840
Okay, yeah, you almost killed the snake.

1888
02:00:53,840 --> 02:00:58,840
You just like fucking like just like crushed its head with your fists into the ground.

1889
02:00:58,840 --> 02:01:02,840
You're gay, even though that's good here, I guess.

1890
02:01:02,840 --> 02:01:03,840
Whoops.

1891
02:01:03,840 --> 02:01:08,840
Yeah, and now it is your turn, buddy Bowser.

1892
02:01:08,840 --> 02:01:16,840
I'm just continuing towards the coins. Let's see. I think I might yeah, I reached the pot of gold.

1893
02:01:16,840 --> 02:01:17,840
Okay, what do you want to do?

1894
02:01:17,840 --> 02:01:22,840
I'm just I'm shoveling them into my mouth. I want to try to eat every single coin.

1895
02:01:22,840 --> 02:01:26,840
As you're eating the coins, the rainbow is slowly receding.

1896
02:01:26,840 --> 02:01:29,840
As you continue to eat the coins.

1897
02:01:29,840 --> 02:01:34,840
In character, I cannot reasonably stop eating these.

1898
02:01:34,840 --> 02:01:39,400
You see the leprechauns on top of the rainbow, they're like

1899
02:01:39,400 --> 02:01:47,800
You see the leprechauns on top of the rainbow like and then they see the rainbows starting to recede and they start running backwards

1900
02:01:47,800 --> 02:01:54,460
Yeah, you see the leprechaun on your back buddy

1901
02:01:54,460 --> 02:01:58,100
He's like, how did you turn the artists are trying to slap you get you to stop?

1902
02:01:58,100 --> 02:02:00,920
But he's just too little

1903
02:02:00,920 --> 02:02:07,240
Uh, and uh, yeah, well guess we'll have to resolve that. Um, it is now your turn again Keith benefits. Um,

1904
02:02:07,240 --> 02:02:09,640
Okay. Hold on. Let me see how much movement I have

1905
02:02:09,640 --> 02:02:12,360
because it would be

1906
02:02:12,360 --> 02:02:15,820
Funny you just killed roger clemens

1907
02:02:15,820 --> 02:02:20,120
Okay, is this enough room for me to do a drop kick murphy?

1908
02:02:20,120 --> 02:02:27,560
Yeah, yeah, you'll be five feet away. Okay. All right. I run and just do a drop kick murphy on him. Yeah

1909
02:02:29,240 --> 02:02:34,200
You stick to me perfectly perpendicular like you're about to the ground.

1910
02:02:34,200 --> 02:02:39,400
No, you hit him, you hit him though. Roll damage.

1911
02:02:39,400 --> 02:02:40,840
Okay, 11.

1912
02:02:40,840 --> 02:02:43,640
Yeah, you just fucking kick the shit out of, uh,

1913
02:02:43,640 --> 02:02:46,440
you stick to him, but you kick the shit out of Buddy Bowser.

1914
02:02:46,440 --> 02:02:49,400
I hit his neck while the coins are in and just like...

1915
02:02:49,400 --> 02:02:56,920
Buddy Bowser, roll, roll constitution to see if you like stop eating, uh, uh, the coins.

1916
02:02:56,920 --> 02:02:58,920
Like you, you're not able to keep going.

1917
02:02:58,920 --> 02:02:59,920
fifteen

1918
02:02:59,920 --> 02:03:02,920
you're going

1919
02:03:02,920 --> 02:03:06,480
i did i think you might have to take a good deal of a bunch of them back in

1920
02:03:06,480 --> 02:03:08,080
the area here you do see

1921
02:03:08,080 --> 02:03:10,560
and i'll buy you some more time also

1922
02:03:10,560 --> 02:03:13,840
but you do keep eating in your next heard uh... if that's like what your

1923
02:03:13,840 --> 02:03:15,160
character would do

1924
02:03:15,160 --> 02:03:18,840
you might just have to kill buddy has been stopped this from happening

1925
02:03:18,840 --> 02:03:23,400
uh... damage that i do the body you don't get a man you'd eleven something

1926
02:03:23,400 --> 02:03:25,400
else to eat give me something tasty

1927
02:03:25,400 --> 02:03:28,700
Yeah, okay. Well, we'll resolve that when it's your turn.

1928
02:03:28,700 --> 02:03:34,800
Now it is Yusef's turn / our faithful friend's turn.

1929
02:03:34,800 --> 02:03:38,000
So the dog is going to run over and he's going to lick your

1930
02:03:38,000 --> 02:03:42,600
wounds Yusef and you're going to get one HP back and then

1931
02:03:42,600 --> 02:03:43,800
the wounds are poison.

1932
02:03:43,800 --> 02:03:50,400
And so the dog is like, but he's still standing but he doesn't

1933
02:03:50,400 --> 02:03:54,600
look too good, but you have one HP back and so you can do

1934
02:03:54,600 --> 02:04:01,600
something this turn if you want to. I frailly pick up the gun and point it at Buddy Bowser.

1935
02:04:01,600 --> 02:04:16,040
Okay roll the- it's gonna kill him I'm telling you now. But if you do this you're going to

1936
02:04:16,040 --> 02:04:23,040
kill the character. Dude, that's just... Why did I give you that gun? What have I done?

1937
02:04:23,040 --> 02:04:35,440
Yeah, that hits him! 28! 36 damage? Buddy Bowser, you're dead. You're more than negative

1938
02:04:35,440 --> 02:04:45,440
your HP. What happens, Buddy Bowser? I fall... I'm like... I'm like... I'm like... I'm like...

1939
02:04:45,440 --> 02:04:50,880
like wobbling you know like I'm like kind of like like about to fall over and I

1940
02:04:50,880 --> 02:05:03,400
look at I look at Keith in the eyes and I say tell my mom I'm hungry and then the

1941
02:05:03,400 --> 02:05:10,120
entire contents of my stomach just floods out of my mouth and fills up the pot. You can't do a death

1942
02:05:10,120 --> 02:05:14,520
save so the way I do deaths in D&D is which people have different rules with

1943
02:05:14,520 --> 02:05:34,520
this

1944
02:05:34,520 --> 02:05:43,420
HP is like the idea. Buddy Dry Bones shows up. Dry Buddy. Like it's a wonderful world

1945
02:05:43,420 --> 02:05:49,260
of fantasy, maybe Buddy can come back in another way. You guys see my like my ghost like rise

1946
02:05:49,260 --> 02:05:53,540
up from my body and start rising towards heaven and it just touches a tree branch and gets

1947
02:05:53,540 --> 02:06:00,540
stuck

1948
02:06:00,540 --> 02:06:01,860
killed buddy

1949
02:06:01,860 --> 02:06:05,220
the product goals is filled again

1950
02:06:05,220 --> 02:06:07,980
the little leprechaun jumps on the product gold

1951
02:06:07,980 --> 02:06:09,220
he tips his beard

1952
02:06:09,220 --> 02:06:10,940
towards you keep

1953
02:06:10,940 --> 02:06:13,140

can you get one wish which but it was still a lot

1956
02:06:21,100 --> 02:06:23,100
No, he's gonna eat the gold again, dude.

1957
02:06:23,100 --> 02:06:25,100
Don't fucking bring him back.

1958
02:06:25,100 --> 02:06:27,100
Okay, wait, yeah.

1959
02:06:27,100 --> 02:06:29,100
I wish Buddy was still alive and he stopped eating things.

1960
02:06:29,100 --> 02:06:31,100
You gotta have one wish.

1961
02:06:31,100 --> 02:06:33,100
Uh...

1962
02:06:33,100 --> 02:06:35,100
Hmm.

1963
02:06:35,100 --> 02:06:37,100
Clemmings?

1964
02:06:37,100 --> 02:06:39,100
Fuck, I forgot his name.

1965
02:06:39,100 --> 02:06:41,100
Roger Clemmons?

1966
02:06:41,100 --> 02:06:43,100
You can bring Roger Clemmons back.

1967
02:06:43,100 --> 02:06:45,100
Oh, I wish Buddy's, uh...

1968
02:06:45,100 --> 02:06:47,100
His soul's trapped in the tree.

1969
02:06:47,100 --> 02:06:49,100
So I wish that his soul

1970
02:06:49,100 --> 02:07:00,620
possessed Roger Clemens. You see the leprechaun like stare blankly at you like what the fuck

1971
02:07:00,620 --> 02:07:07,860
like what are you wishing for? I wish that my friend's soul. No no he understands it he's

1972
02:07:07,860 --> 02:07:14,300
just like why are you telling him. I wish that my friend's soul would transport into

1973
02:07:14,300 --> 02:07:27,900
to

1974
02:07:27,900 --> 02:07:33,100
the body of the crushed and shot Roger Clemens.

1975
02:07:33,100 --> 02:07:39,980
And Roger Clemens stands up and buddy, what does Roger Clemens sound like for you?

1976
02:07:39,980 --> 02:07:46,420
Hi guys.

1977
02:07:46,420 --> 02:07:49,580
I'm gonna go hang out in the doctor's office.

1978
02:07:49,580 --> 02:07:53,860
Just walk away.

1979
02:07:53,860 --> 02:07:55,140
And the leprechaun.

1980
02:07:55,140 --> 02:07:57,440
even waiting to see the finale just going straight to the

1981
02:07:57,440 --> 02:08:01,640
leprechaun flies up into the rainbow meets with all his

1982
02:08:01,640 --> 02:08:02,440
friends.

1983
02:08:02,440 --> 02:08:07,740
You guys wave goodbye to the leprechauns the snakes the

1984
02:08:07,740 --> 02:08:11,740
snakes at this point give up and vanish.

1985
02:08:11,740 --> 02:08:13,740
I don't think they have to keep fighting at this point.

1986
02:08:13,740 --> 02:08:20,640
It's kind of over and the camera zooms out on this beautiful

1987
02:08:20,640 --> 02:08:23,340
little town is beautiful rainbow on this perfect st.

1988
02:08:23,340 --> 02:08:33,020
Patrick's Day. And you see in the sky you hear it sounds like

1989
02:08:33,020 --> 02:08:42,380
sounds like sleigh bells ringing. And you hear ho ho ho it's me

1990
02:08:42,420 --> 02:08:44,420
St. Patrick

1991
02:08:44,420 --> 02:08:51,460
And uh, St. Patrick

1992
02:08:51,460 --> 02:08:57,620
And you see

1993
02:08:57,620 --> 02:09:06,180
He's so beautiful i'll have to post that visual

1994
02:09:06,180 --> 02:09:10,420
It's st. Patrick

1995
02:09:10,420 --> 02:09:15,940
I'll give everyone a visual aid when they're listening to this.

1996
02:09:15,940 --> 02:09:20,380
You should check the Discord or the Twitter and you'll see a visual aid I guess is what

1997
02:09:20,380 --> 02:09:21,380
we'll do.

1998
02:09:21,380 --> 02:09:23,780
And St. Patrick shows up.

1999
02:09:23,780 --> 02:09:30,060
Then Mary St. Patrick just belches and flies away.

2000
02:09:30,060 --> 02:09:31,060
The end.

2001
02:09:31,060 --> 02:09:32,060
Wow.

2002
02:09:32,060 --> 02:09:33,060
You really tied a boogaloo's end.

2003
02:09:33,060 --> 02:09:40,060

2004
02:09:40,060 --> 02:09:42,060
