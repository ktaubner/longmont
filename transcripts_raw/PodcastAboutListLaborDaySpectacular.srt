00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
[music]

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
This land is your land, this land is my land.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
I'm a Texas tiger, you're a liberal wiener.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,000
I'm a great crusader, you're a Herman Munster.

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000
This land will surely vote for me.

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Okay, we're going. We're going.

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Monday, September 5th, 1892.

8
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,040
It's 12.01am in Duluth, Brooklyn, right?

9
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:34,000
When the work day starts.

10
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,960
But nobody's working today.

11
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:42,360
You see, yesterday, the 100% illegal Barrel Workers Union staged a citywide strike, specifically

12
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:45,940
in protest against the more than fair working conditions found in the Solve in the Frog

13
00:00:45,940 --> 00:00:51,160
Enterprise Barrel Suspenders and Clothes Burning Corporation, factory in the Busvich neighborhood

14
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:55,800
of Duluth, Brooklyn, where Barrel Suspenders and Clothes Burning takes place.

15
00:00:55,800 --> 00:01:09,480
Hasan the Chapo, the dreaded Turk, friend to the common man and seriously clouded, has brought

16
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:14,320
his foreign ideas about labor laws to the uncorrupted mind of the good Duluthian worker,

17
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:16,960
organizing them against their benevolent employers.

18
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:17,960
Scandalous!

19
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:22,660
And now, he and his army of child laborers and a few awesome older laborers are attempting

20
00:01:22,660 --> 00:01:27,300
storm the factory, take it over by force, and have it be the first worker-run, barrel-suspenders

21
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:29,700
and clothes-burning factory the world has ever seen.

22
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:37,460
Okay, this is fucked. This is seriously fucked. We can't stand for this shit, guys. It's fucking

23
00:01:37,460 --> 00:01:43,540
garbage, dude. I'm honestly so sick of this shit. We don't get paid. We don't get time off. It's

24
00:01:43,540 --> 00:01:47,940
fucking weak. And those chuds in there, they're not gonna fucking stop until, like, you know,

25
00:01:47,940 --> 00:01:54,780
You know, like we step in there, and you hear the twitchy chattering of the union outside.

26
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:57,380
Today we're walking out of here, and like honestly bro, fuck it.

27
00:01:57,380 --> 00:02:02,500
They're a bunch of fucking neoliberal fucking scumbags who think they know what's right,

28
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:04,460
and know what to do, but they don't.

29
00:02:04,460 --> 00:02:06,200
They're fucking stupid.

30
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:07,200
Let's take them down.

31
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:09,660
Let's walk today, bro.

32
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:11,860
The strike had been building for some time, you see.

33
00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:16,900
Sullivan the Frog, factory manager and frog person which the company is not named after,

34
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:18,780
has been working to make the Bustvich factory

35
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:21,400
the best and most profitable one in the company.

36
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:24,000
In doing so, he's innovated in a number of ways.

37
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,760
Installing feeding troughs throughout

38
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:28,500
to keep meals brief, efficient, and cost effective.

39
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:29,420
Is it troughs?

40
00:02:29,420 --> 00:02:30,260
- Troughs. - Troughs.

41
00:02:30,260 --> 00:02:31,940
- Troughs, how do we say that wrong?

42
00:02:31,940 --> 00:02:33,980
- You drop in trough. - You've only read it.

43
00:02:33,980 --> 00:02:35,340
- Yeah, you city boy.

44
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:36,180
(laughing)

45
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:37,020
- You never said trough?

46
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:37,860
- You've never seen a trough?

47
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:38,900
- I've never said trough.

48
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:41,060
- I am a city boy.

49
00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:42,660
- Holy shit, the pig's trough.

50
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:45,100
- He never read Charlotte's Web in class.

51
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:45,940
- Well, he read it, but he said--

52
00:02:45,940 --> 00:02:49,940
I never read it. He read it in the city class.

53
00:02:49,940 --> 00:02:51,940
Oh yeah. The trow.

54
00:02:51,940 --> 00:02:53,940
They were all using iPads and headphones probably.

55
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:56,940
That's right. I would read about it and go trow.

56
00:02:56,940 --> 00:02:58,940
Like, because I didn't know how to say it.

57
00:02:58,940 --> 00:02:59,940
Just keep going.

58
00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:03,940
As well as enforcing a BYOD, or bring your own diaper policy.

59
00:03:03,940 --> 00:03:06,940
To ensure there isn't too much overhead, he adjusted pay to $50 an hour

60
00:03:06,940 --> 00:03:10,940
from the previous $20 an hour every employee was paying to work there.

61
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:12,940
While the results speak for themselves,

62
00:03:12,940 --> 00:03:19,540
With enough barrels and suspenders to clothe the whole city. The workers felt like they got too many owies and boo-boos, and so they went on strike.

63
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:25,500
Sullivan, panicking, already really not suited for this kind of stuff, asked his assistant,

64
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:29,080
"Child Worker Superstar Jordy El Nino Polla"

65
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:38,580
*laughter*

66
00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:40,580
Dude, that gets us.

67
00:03:40,580 --> 00:03:42,580
Giggle Bear.

68
00:03:42,580 --> 00:03:47,980
A+ for GiggleBerry.

69
00:03:47,980 --> 00:03:53,700
To call the Pinky Toe Detective Agency, who sent their finest Pinky Toe agents to help.

70
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:58,720
However, not wanting to let this just be led by Sullivan, you three decided to step in

71
00:03:58,720 --> 00:03:59,720
to assist.

72
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:00,720
Oh, Pinky Toe.

73
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:01,720
Like Pinkerton.

74
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:02,720
I get it.

75
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:03,720
And who are you?

76
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:04,720
Like Pinkerton?

77
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:05,720
I thought we were businessmen.

78
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:06,720
You are your businessmen.

79
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:07,720
Weeza.

80
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:08,720
Weeza.

81
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:09,720
Weeza.

82
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:12,180
So tell me, where's a Weeza this game?

83
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:19,160
what you know we kind of look we're kind of like Weezer ways

84
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:27,800
Weezer, Weezer, Pinkerton, Pinkerton, I'm a do the things and I wanna do pork and beans,

85
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:34,200
Weezer, Blue, the blue album, blue album, continue, so you guys, who are you guys, Weezer, Weezer,

86
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:40,200
Weezer, Weezer, Weezer, Weezer, Weezer, Weezer, Weezer, Weezer, Weezer, Weezer, Weezer, Weezer,

87
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:41,200
We can't.

88
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:42,200
So yeah, you guys are...

89
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:43,200
Good way!

90
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:45,200
I can totally be Weezer!

91
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:47,200
We might be Weezer!

92
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:49,200
Yeah baby, yeah we're Weezer!

93
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:51,200
I'm Weezer baby!

94
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:52,200
Yeah baby!

95
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:53,200
No.

96
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:58,200
Do Asian girls make me horny baby?

97
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:00,200
Yes!

98
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:02,200
I'm Weezer!

99
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:05,200
You are 18 year old girl!

100
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:12,200
You guys are the executives who run the barrel suspenders and clothes burning factory.

101
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:13,200
Yes.

102
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:15,800
You can be Weezer or you can tell me who you are.

103
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:16,800
I wrote a whole intro.

104
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:18,800
You can also be the guy you came here with.

105
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:24,800
I would say it's 49% of me is like I have to be Weezer, but 51% is like I already am.

106
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:27,500
I could be pushed over the edge.

107
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:28,800
We could turn into Weezer.

108
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:29,800
Weezer!

109
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:30,800
With these one-offs.

110
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:31,800
Here's what I'll say.

111
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:32,800
You never know.

112
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:34,140
Just start with your characters.

113
00:05:34,140 --> 00:05:35,140
If you end up being Weezer.

114
00:05:35,140 --> 00:05:37,140
Is it transforming into Weezer?

115
00:05:37,140 --> 00:05:39,140
Let's see where it goes.

116
00:05:39,140 --> 00:05:40,140
Weezer!

117
00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:41,140
Hey!

118
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:44,140
Hey, what are you doing here? Can't you see I'm busy?

119
00:05:44,140 --> 00:05:45,140
No, you didn't tell me to introduce yourself.

120
00:05:45,140 --> 00:05:46,140
You wanna know about me?

121
00:05:46,140 --> 00:05:48,140
Fuck you! I grew up rich!

122
00:05:48,140 --> 00:05:50,140
I plan on staying rich.

123
00:05:50,140 --> 00:05:52,140
Money is the only thing I know about.

124
00:05:52,140 --> 00:05:56,140
In school, I never went to school. I paid poor people to go to school for me.

125
00:05:56,140 --> 00:05:58,140
That's how rich I am.

126
00:05:58,140 --> 00:06:00,140
Ultimately, I have the education of a second grader,

127
00:06:00,140 --> 00:06:05,100
but I have the cash and cars of a man who is almost four times the age of a second grader. Got it?

128
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:10,140
No, you don't. I don't even get it. Do you have any gum? I made gum. No, I didn't.

129
00:06:10,140 --> 00:06:14,720
I paid poor people to make gum for me. I just thought of the idea for gum.

130
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:17,200
There's a new style of gum.

131
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:19,460
It's called quadruple bubble.

132
00:06:19,460 --> 00:06:24,520
Unfortunately, everyone in the factory died of a shark attack. Didn't see that coming, did ya?

133
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:28,320
No one sees me coming. Not even my own wife, our first kid.

134
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:30,720
I paid a poor person to bust his gunk in her slit

135
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:34,520
I have no immediate heirs

136
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:42,660
None that none that are related to me. You know why I'm gonna live forever who cares. I don't care look at me

137
00:06:42,660 --> 00:06:47,340
I weigh 400 pounds. I'm 5 foot 2 and I'll dance with you got it. Look at this

138
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:51,360
Look at what I can do with my arm. What's his name?

139
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:54,640
Look what I can do with my arm

140
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:56,880
You want to see it? Give me a dollar

141
00:06:57,320 --> 00:07:02,020
See I'm smart I have business savvy. I'm addicted to drowning people

142
00:07:02,020 --> 00:07:04,640
small people

143
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:10,780
Richer people for my first wife. She was fat five foot nine 120 pounds. I couldn't stand to look at her

144
00:07:10,780 --> 00:07:18,720
I've been married 100 times all drowned who cares the police. I'm the police I think I don't remember

145
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:22,200
Was I supposed to tell you that I drowned those women?

146
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:26,200
It doesn't matter. I'll pay for your silence

147
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:33,200
Look at you! Look at us! All my buddies rich as fuck! Watch this! Didn't see it too bad,

148
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:44,040
it'll cost you to see it again! See? I'm smart! That's why they pay me the big bucks! My name's

149
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:51,040
Johnny Knoxville and welcome to Jackass! What does that mean? I have no idea, who cares?

150
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:54,040
I'm Dan and Fudd, creator of the Ridge Wallet.

151
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:55,040
That's good.

152
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:56,040
This guy's on hinge.

153
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:57,040
So Dan and Fudd, yeah.

154
00:07:57,040 --> 00:08:02,040
Dan is fully just unprompted, just starts introducing himself.

155
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:05,760
Yeah, you're sitting in the executive office that is carved out of all these factories.

156
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:07,640
I thought you told us to start doing intros.

157
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:08,640
No, I did.

158
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:12,640
I wasn't sure if I was going to know who exactly you were, but you're with them in the executive

159
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:19,360
office where Sullivan is there and he's beside himself and standing nearby is Jordy, who

160
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:25,760
is just the best child worker ever and has been like a loyal to Sullivan this whole

161
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:30,000
time. And who else is here too? Who are the other two executives who run this

162
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:37,200
company? Say! The name's Robert Downey Jr. and I didn't prepare anything for this

163
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:41,720
meeting here but I'm very excited to meet all of you. It's a great pleasure.

164
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:46,680
You see, I clawed my way to the top of this company. It was a hard

165
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:50,880
hard task you see I used to be completely addicted to something

166
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:56,280
whatever they do at this time time period sure a lot of them

167
00:08:56,280 --> 00:09:04,080

00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:08,880
stuff, but I got some right here. Thank you. You're welcome.

169
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:11,880
And then you hear like I'm hitting an opium bong. It's like

170
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:21,480
Yeah, exactly. But my main thing is I have a power suit. It's a, I call it that

171
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:24,640
because it's a suit that gives me powers, like the power to have a heavy

172
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:30,960
footstep, a very loud clanging footstep or a very slow but hard punch. And it's

173
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:35,000
it's powered by the some of the the greatest technologies that our time

174
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:43,280
period has to offer like steam and clocks, child labor, and it looks cool. It

175
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:50,120
does it, it burns me completely when I turn it on. It's filled with steam and I've been trying to make it fly.

176
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:56,320
So Robert Downey jr. but also classes. A bunch of pipes, a little hot steam on your body.

177
00:09:56,320 --> 00:10:03,400
Dan and Fudd is a monk by the way, level 5, way of the drunken fist. I've never

178
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:21,620
had a sip of alcohol in my life. I'm 16 years old you see.

179
00:10:21,620 --> 00:10:29,100
A child executive. And then Robert Downey Jr. obviously is an artificer, an artillerist.

180
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:33,580
obviously obviously and then we have one more

181
00:10:33,580 --> 00:10:42,460
Hello! My name is Tuck and I'm a really really good business owner. I've owned tons and tons

182
00:10:42,460 --> 00:10:48,620
of businesses that sell really really good stuff. During the Civil War I fought for the

183
00:10:48,620 --> 00:10:58,060
Confederacy! But I was discharged for being too loud. Then I started my fourth business,

184
00:10:58,060 --> 00:11:05,580
The West want we sold sandwiches. I opened more West once then I sold the West one and

185
00:11:05,580 --> 00:11:12,460
now here I am one of the wittiest moguls in the country. I was born in America and I'll

186
00:11:12,460 --> 00:11:17,180
die in America because I really really like it here.

187
00:11:17,180 --> 00:11:28,740
cool tuck is a barbarian path of the beat you don't say yeah so you guys are in

188
00:11:28,740 --> 00:11:33,540
right now in the executive office with Sullivan and Jordi who are there trying

189
00:11:33,540 --> 00:11:37,660
to explain you guys a situation you know but the strike happened there's all these

190
00:11:37,660 --> 00:11:41,260
issues and so we don't spend much time at the factory we're here to solve yeah

191
00:11:41,260 --> 00:11:44,620
you're here to solve this problem okay basically like like you guys so we're

192
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:47,740
not familiar with this office. Yeah, you guys run a bunch of different factories. At every

193
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:51,260
factory there's an executive office that you guys are allowed into and so you guys just

194
00:11:51,260 --> 00:11:57,500
are up here right now as outside the pinky toe agency men are lining up and the people

195
00:11:57,500 --> 00:12:03,220
who are in the union workers are lining up as well. So this is the only time that we're

196
00:12:03,220 --> 00:12:08,900
ever in this building is to go into our office. Not even, it's like you have a headquarters.

197
00:12:08,900 --> 00:12:12,900
This is like a factory among your...

198
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:14,900
We don't have an office in here?

199
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:16,900
Yeah, you're in your office.

200
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:18,900
But you wouldn't go in.

201
00:12:18,900 --> 00:12:24,900
It's like you wouldn't go into the office of a factory unless you were overseeing it that week or something.

202
00:12:24,900 --> 00:12:27,900
But otherwise you would be at the corporate headquarters.

203
00:12:27,900 --> 00:12:29,900
I'm going to investigate the office.

204
00:12:29,900 --> 00:12:31,900
Yeah, you can definitely do that.

205
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:33,900
Roll investigation check.

206
00:12:36,900 --> 00:12:37,900
What is that?

207
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:38,900
That is a 19.

208
00:12:38,900 --> 00:12:39,900
That's good.

209
00:12:39,900 --> 00:12:43,460
Plus my investigation, which is a zero, so that is a 19.

210
00:12:43,460 --> 00:12:44,460
I mean, that's good.

211
00:12:44,460 --> 00:12:50,380
Yeah, I mean, so, you know, it looks similar to your other corporate executive offices that

212
00:12:50,380 --> 00:12:51,380
you've seen.

213
00:12:51,380 --> 00:12:53,900
I'm looking for like a Matt Lauer button.

214
00:12:53,900 --> 00:12:54,900
Yeah.

215
00:12:54,900 --> 00:13:00,140
There isn't a Matt Lauer button here, but you do, so one of the things I can tell you

216
00:13:00,140 --> 00:13:03,540
about is that there is a door to like this like...

217
00:13:03,540 --> 00:13:05,060
Is there a painting on the wall?

218
00:13:05,060 --> 00:13:06,060
Yes.

219
00:13:06,060 --> 00:13:07,580
will take a hundred

220
00:13:07,580 --> 00:13:10,300
you take a look at the off there is nothing behind the painting i will

221
00:13:10,300 --> 00:13:13,060
there'd be a something not even a wall was a wall by

222
00:13:13,060 --> 00:13:18,180
yeah i think i was almost out of the area not i will tell you that i will say

223
00:13:18,180 --> 00:13:21,460
that with your best addition you actually do hear some rumbling from the

224
00:13:21,460 --> 00:13:23,540
toilet

225
00:13:23,540 --> 00:13:24,420
for a

226
00:13:24,420 --> 00:13:26,780
the by

227
00:13:26,780 --> 00:13:31,100
you got your keep that down if you're gonna do that in their my bad

228
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:35,060
i know what you're doing in their two and i can see it too and it's not good

229
00:13:35,060 --> 00:13:37,300
Okay, I would like to now open the door.

230
00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:38,140
I was in the bathroom.

231
00:13:38,140 --> 00:13:39,740
I'm gonna open the door of the bathroom.

232
00:13:39,740 --> 00:13:40,580
- Okay, yeah.

233
00:13:40,580 --> 00:13:43,180
- The three of you are wumbling in there.

234
00:13:43,180 --> 00:13:44,860
- Yeah, and I know what you're doing.

235
00:13:44,860 --> 00:13:46,100
- Okay, go duck it out.

236
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:48,660
- I haven't used the toilet.

237
00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:49,500
- You used it?

238
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:51,180
- No, I never used the executive toilet.

239
00:13:51,180 --> 00:13:52,020
- Okay, hold on.

240
00:13:52,020 --> 00:13:52,860
- Company policy.

241
00:13:52,860 --> 00:13:53,680
- We're all gonna get to the bottom of this toilet.

242
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:54,860
- Say, you've never used a toilet before?

243
00:13:54,860 --> 00:13:55,700
- One jaw.

244
00:13:55,700 --> 00:13:57,220
- I grab Sullivan 'cause he's green.

245
00:13:57,220 --> 00:13:58,060
I think he's a plunger.

246
00:13:58,060 --> 00:14:00,340
And he looks like kind of plastic, rubbery.

247
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:03,740
And I start dunking him in and out of the toilet.

248
00:14:03,740 --> 00:14:07,220
Wait, I think I can be of assistance with this. I have a piston on my arm.

249
00:14:07,220 --> 00:14:07,560
Yeah.

250
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:09,560
(imitating piston)

251
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:13,060
Let me staple him, I mean the plunger, to your arm.

252
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:15,340
Oh, hold on. Let me flush it for a second.

253
00:14:15,340 --> 00:14:15,860
Yeah.

254
00:14:15,860 --> 00:14:19,300
I pull down like the, the cord or whatever.

255
00:14:19,300 --> 00:14:19,800
Mm-hmm.

256
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:21,180
Yeah, you pull down the cord breaks.

257
00:14:21,180 --> 00:14:21,460
Yeah.

258
00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:23,460
(laughing)

259
00:14:23,460 --> 00:14:24,300
I don't know how that works.

260
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:25,060
So you use the piston.

261
00:14:25,060 --> 00:14:28,060
Well, my piston is supposed to be going really fast like that, but it's, it's,

262
00:14:28,060 --> 00:14:32,780
it's a really shitty power suit. So it's, uh, it's, um, it's really slow.

263
00:14:32,780 --> 00:14:36,380
it's like a hydraulic press is just slowly pushing the toilet.

264
00:14:36,380 --> 00:14:40,380
He's like yeah it's like he's just yeah it's like a Bond villain dropping

265
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:45,340
somebody in the law. It's exactly like a hydraulic press like a YouTube video of

266
00:14:45,340 --> 00:14:49,740
green slime. And as you're pulling Sullivan out. Oh I didn't pull him out

267
00:14:49,740 --> 00:14:54,820
yet. Okay it's just in there. Yeah the piston's stuck there's nothing you can do.

268
00:14:54,820 --> 00:14:59,340
Yeah while Sullivan's stuck in there, Jordy comes up to you guys he says you know Sullivan's

269
00:14:59,340 --> 00:15:02,700
not really good at running this place I have to say like I think I could

270
00:15:02,700 --> 00:15:05,860
probably run this way better than all right you're in charge who the fuck is

271
00:15:05,860 --> 00:15:12,980
Sullivan I thought you were Sullivan no I'm Jordi he's Jordi oh well where's

276
00:15:29,460 --> 00:15:34,700
Sullivan starts to get pulled out he says there's there's a there's a there's

00:16:17,700 --> 00:16:23,780

factory layout before they destroyed more than one devolves of Viking funeral

00:17:11,380 --> 00:17:18,580
So my entire body is completely but I'm going to say you don't take damage from

299

I'm going to say I take damage you do because it's the very beginning so I'll

300
00:17:21,380 --> 00:17:22,980
have time to go to the hospital or whatever.

301
00:17:22,980 --> 00:17:23,780
Yeah, sure.

302
00:17:23,780 --> 00:17:24,280
Let's roll.

303
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:25,680
I'd like to burn my entire body.

304
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:26,380
Burn your body.

305
00:17:26,380 --> 00:17:27,680
It's like the 20s.

306
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:29,780
All you just have to take for fire.

307
00:17:29,780 --> 00:17:29,880
Yeah,

308
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:34,080

311
00:17:41,540 --> 00:17:49,460
Yeah, so you guys can use that. I've already drank both of them. Yeah, this is not useful.

312
00:17:49,460 --> 00:17:55,300
You are disgusting. I'm an alcoholic. But we haven't invented alcoholism yet, so I just have a

313
00:17:55,300 --> 00:18:01,460
I just have a funny tinge to me. You burn up the worker, he's just ashes right? He's just ashes now.

314
00:18:01,460 --> 00:18:06,540
uh... and uh... jordy pulls on a projector as he does the floor rotates in a mini

315
00:18:06,540 --> 00:18:08,140

00:18:30,220 --> 00:18:32,780
the man in the tuxedo starts reading off of cue cards.

324
00:18:32,780 --> 00:18:33,620

00:18:43,660 --> 00:18:45,260
in one of our state of the art factories.

332
00:18:45,260 --> 00:18:46,420
You're gonna need to know the ins and outs

333
00:18:46,420 --> 00:18:48,240
of those factories if you want to succeed here.

334
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:49,780
So let's go over some important information

335
00:18:49,780 --> 00:18:50,620
around its layout.

336
00:18:50,620 --> 00:18:51,740
And so then you see this map

337
00:18:51,740 --> 00:18:52,940
that I drew for you guys over here.

338
00:18:52,940 --> 00:18:54,860
- Oh my. - Wow, it's beautiful.

339
00:18:54,860 --> 00:18:58,540
- I try to climb into the screen.

340
00:18:58,540 --> 00:18:59,860
- Yeah, the train is coming and you're like,

341
00:18:59,860 --> 00:19:01,140
I want to get on board.

342
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:03,340
(laughing)

343
00:19:03,340 --> 00:19:05,860
The factory is split into two main sections,

344
00:19:05,860 --> 00:19:07,900
and then there's smaller locales around it.

345
00:19:07,900 --> 00:19:09,420
Okay, you see all that?

346
00:19:09,420 --> 00:19:11,060
The main sections are the barrel section

347
00:19:11,060 --> 00:19:12,120
and the suspender section.

348
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:13,760
Here's the barrel section, all right?

349
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:15,160
Here's the suspender section.

350
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:18,180
The barrels are assembled in the barrel section

351
00:19:18,180 --> 00:19:20,220
by the workers and the machines aligning the bottom,

352
00:19:20,220 --> 00:19:22,080
middle, and top parts of the barrel.

353
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:25,180
So the bottom gets loaded in here from the docking bay,

354
00:19:25,180 --> 00:19:27,020
and then it goes around once,

355
00:19:27,020 --> 00:19:28,620
and it gets the top part, goes around again,

356
00:19:28,620 --> 00:19:32,140
gets the bottom part of the barrel and then it's dis- and then uh or rather

357
00:19:32,140 --> 00:19:35,460
sorry the barrels are like brought in here the bottom parts goes around here

358
00:19:35,460 --> 00:19:37,580
and it gets the middle part on it and then it comes around here and gets the

359
00:19:37,580 --> 00:19:41,300
top part on it and then that completed barrel ends up in here. Okay. And then

360
00:19:41,300 --> 00:19:46,660
it's carted out through here into the suspender section. Um, where the barrels

361
00:19:46,660 --> 00:19:50,300
are funneled into the suspenders machine which is over here where hot glue is

362
00:19:50,300 --> 00:19:54,700
applied, suspenders holders, and then the actual suspenders themselves and then

363
00:19:54,700 --> 00:19:58,180
they are brought over here this is where the workers apply the suspenders and

364
00:19:58,180 --> 00:20:02,500
then they're brought over here into the rather than this is the where things are

365
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:06,540
loaded the loading area this is the dispatch area so it's loaded onto one of

366
00:20:06,540 --> 00:20:09,740
these 16 wheeler trucks that are pulled by oh so that's where we dispatch the

367
00:20:09,740 --> 00:20:13,860
workers that's where we all sing the song the general by dispatch what the hell is

368
00:20:13,860 --> 00:20:23,060
a twerk I think you're gonna say your name there's 16 as a worker you may be

369
00:20:23,060 --> 00:20:27,300
assigned to to the clothes burning facility on the west end of the factory

370
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:30,020
free. This is over here. This is a closed burning facility.

371
00:20:30,020 --> 00:20:34,300
How many employees real quick do we have? Sure, you have 200 at this factory.

372
00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:36,100
Okay. They're all striking right now.

373
00:20:36,100 --> 00:20:38,340
199 now. My son's dead. Yeah.

374
00:20:38,340 --> 00:20:41,540
Yeah. True. Can we keep a running tally?

375
00:20:41,540 --> 00:20:44,820
Yeah. I have a number. I am keeping track of numbers

376
00:20:44,820 --> 00:20:48,100
of employees. Okay, nice. Awesome.

377
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:52,860
With a 10% survival rate, this is only for our most disposable workers. You funnel clothes.

378
00:20:52,860 --> 00:20:55,940
What the hell is a workaholic? They couldn't edit that out of the video?

379
00:20:55,940 --> 00:20:57,940
- Pause the video! - Pause the presentation!

380
00:20:57,940 --> 00:20:59,940
He pauses the video, the guy's...

381
00:20:59,940 --> 00:21:01,940
I'm sorry, I'm sorry folks, I misread the cue card.

382
00:21:01,940 --> 00:21:03,940
I'm sorry.

383
00:21:03,940 --> 00:21:05,940
They're capin' the bloopers in the movies now!

384
00:21:05,940 --> 00:21:07,940
What the hell is going on?

385
00:21:07,940 --> 00:21:09,940
Wait a minute, what's a movie?

386
00:21:09,940 --> 00:21:11,940
I was confused by this earlier!

387
00:21:11,940 --> 00:21:13,940
"Jordy, please press play!"

388
00:21:13,940 --> 00:21:15,940
And Jordy presses play on the film.

389
00:21:15,940 --> 00:21:17,940
Uh, the factory has, uh...

390
00:21:17,940 --> 00:21:19,940
And so you will funnel clothes

391
00:21:19,940 --> 00:21:21,940
gathered from none of your business

392
00:21:21,940 --> 00:21:23,940
and burn them into one of the four industrial furnaces over here.

393
00:21:23,940 --> 00:21:30,780
over here. This powers the factory and also keeps warm the floor manager and the

394
00:21:30,780 --> 00:21:33,420
assistant's office. So that's where their offices are. So it's right behind us?

395
00:21:33,420 --> 00:21:37,080
It's right over here. So you guys are in the executive area over here. This is the floor

396
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:41,900
manager's office and this is Jordi's office. Okay. Over here is, by the way, so

397
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:45,380
when it's loaded into here, the stuff, this is where the barrels are put and

398
00:21:45,380 --> 00:21:48,980
this is where the suspenders are put. These are the storage areas. And these are

399
00:21:48,980 --> 00:21:53,100
horse-drawn? These are horse-drawn trucks. 16-wheel trucks. Horse-drawn

400
00:21:53,100 --> 00:21:58,660
16-wheeler trucks. The factory has three main entrances. This is probably the more

401
00:21:58,660 --> 00:22:02,660
important part. So the front entrance, which opens into a lobby area for when

402
00:22:02,660 --> 00:22:06,360
visitors come to the factory. You, as a worker, are never to use this. This is the

403
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:12,100
lobby area where you usually have a receptionist. Then you have the... where

404
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:15,460
am I going? Yeah, then we have the back entrance, which is the unloading area for

405
00:22:15,460 --> 00:22:19,640
raw barrel and suspended materials, which is over here. So you have entrances that

406
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:22,920
go in here these are like the loading docks but you have entrances where you

407
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:28,520
walk in here and then you it moves into the rest of the factory then you have do

408
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:32,240
you have a third you have two other major entrance you have one other major

409
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:35,200
entrance which is the this is the unloading dock right so this is where

410
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:39,840
you store him and it sends it out off off to the fucking stores or whatever

411
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:44,320
and then you have an entrance into the burning facility as well to the closed

412
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:46,600
burning facility but it's only from the outside and it doesn't move into the

413
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:51,600
factory. Okay. So you can't like go from here out in there. And then there's one

414
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:55,760
other entrance, the worker entrance, which they take the outdoor toilets where they

415
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:59,140
go in them like Mario and they come out on the other side in the suspenders part

416
00:22:59,140 --> 00:23:02,880
of the factory over here. So there's three outdoor toilets here. Mm-hmm. So

417
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:07,960
workers can use this to end up in here and they pop up a pop up here. And they

418
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:11,440
go through the toilet. Yes, through the toilet. Like Fortnite. So they're not

419
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:14,120
allowed to enter the barrels part until they have scrubbed themselves clean

420
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:18,440
because visitors enter through the barrels part of the factory. So best to get here early if you're

421
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:22,680
on barrel duty that day. Finally, there are stairs on the northeast end, this is where you guys are,

422
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:27,080
the facility. This office should be occupied by no one except when one of the three Sullivan

423
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:30,440
the Frog executives have arrived. Trespassers will be thrown into the furnace.

424
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:34,920
We have to throw all these people besides us who are in here into the furnace, right?

425
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:36,280
Yeah. Well, they're not. We gave them permission.

426
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:37,640
Yeah, you gave them permission. I didn't give them permission.

427
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:40,040
So we have to put Sullivan in the furnace. I guess you could kill them.

428
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:43,160
There is a platform you can walk on that wraps around the entire main two subsections of the

429
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:47,880
is a factory. So this is a platform where you can observe. Oh my God, I cannot wait to walk

430
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:52,240
around that with my hands behind my back. A platform! I walk out and I want to see what

431
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:55,800
it's like out there. Yeah, so you can see the full factory. I mean, nothing is working

432
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:59,660
right now. You know, there's no workers here. So you can hear the noises of industry because

433
00:23:59,660 --> 00:24:03,840
clothes are still being burned, and the conveyor belts are going, but there's no barrels loaded

434
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:06,800
on them. There's no suspenders loaded. So there's no workers in here? Yeah, they're

435
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:13,280
all outside right now, about to storm. Oh, okay. The facility is trying to take it over.

436
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:16,800
I thought that they were in the factory. Bruh!

437
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:20,800
Say, bruh! Bruh!

438
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:23,800
Wha! Bruh!

439
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:28,800
And so this allows you to walk around the entire factory area, but you can't, it doesn't

440
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:32,640
allow you to walk in here. There are windows along here though, so you can see what's going

441
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:36,580
on outside from here too. And you can see what's going on in these other parts of

442
00:24:36,580 --> 00:24:40,860
the factory. But you can't see like outside from like these two

443
00:24:40,860 --> 00:24:47,060
walls because that's where that is. And then yeah, thank you for watching. You're

444
00:24:47,060 --> 00:24:51,560
sure to not be a complete loser as a worker I'm sure. Solve in the Frog

445
00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:57,740
Enterprises. There's the door. The movie was wrong. There's nobody in here. This

446
00:24:57,740 --> 00:25:00,500
This place is as empty as a muh.

447
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:01,900
- A what? - A muh.

448
00:25:01,900 --> 00:25:02,820
- You know, like a muh.

449
00:25:02,820 --> 00:25:04,980
- Like damn, that was cool as a muh.

450
00:25:04,980 --> 00:25:06,180
(laughing)

451
00:25:06,180 --> 00:25:07,420
Like that.

452
00:25:07,420 --> 00:25:08,260
It means like, where would you--

453
00:25:08,260 --> 00:25:10,540
- Say, I think he's trying to say muh-fuh.

454
00:25:10,540 --> 00:25:11,900
- Like muh, like damn.

455
00:25:11,900 --> 00:25:12,740
- Oh, muh-fuh.

456
00:25:12,740 --> 00:25:13,580
- That was cool as a muh. - A muh-fuh.

457
00:25:13,580 --> 00:25:14,540
- That's the issue.

458
00:25:14,540 --> 00:25:16,100
- Now it's just muh.

459
00:25:16,100 --> 00:25:17,140
- It's just muh.

460
00:25:17,140 --> 00:25:17,980
- Yeah.

461
00:25:17,980 --> 00:25:19,500
- None of the words-- - Say, bruh.

462
00:25:19,500 --> 00:25:20,700
- There is we.

463
00:25:20,700 --> 00:25:22,280
- I hired the pinky toe agents,

464
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:24,400
but I'm hoping that you guys can help too.

465
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:25,580
- So, here's what you guys--

466
00:25:25,580 --> 00:25:33,420
we were the pinky toe agent no you guys should run the company oh so you have

467
00:25:33,420 --> 00:25:39,180
three you have two moves you can do mm-hmm I have four moves I can do watch

468
00:25:39,180 --> 00:25:51,340
this this is called the Charleston actually but you can do I invented this

469
00:25:51,340 --> 00:25:55,020
Start so I'm one of the greatest that is a cutting-edge dance

470
00:25:55,020 --> 00:26:02,020
Never seen anything like it. It's gonna take the world by storm after all this check out this one. I invented it's called the renegade

471
00:26:02,020 --> 00:26:07,620
Wow that's amazing PT's are when they invent small cameras

472
00:26:07,620 --> 00:26:13,280
That's gonna look incredible pinky toe agents and W's are the workers, okay?

473
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:16,540
So these are you the forces okay there these guys are outside the map

474
00:26:16,780 --> 00:26:21,700
But they're there on the two ways some of those who work forces are the same who burn bosses

475
00:26:21,700 --> 00:26:26,540
Well, I just well because because I'm not gonna draw and redraw everything. There's gonna just be general movement of the mob

476
00:26:26,540 --> 00:26:30,940
Okay, I wish I had more markers. I could have done this with but anyway, so

477
00:26:30,940 --> 00:26:36,640
But yeah, I am lazy. I guess we need to get like a hologram thing like an endless game

478
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:41,220
Do you think you could do a Star Wars holodeck? I would love to yeah, I think I can make that or

479
00:26:44,660 --> 00:26:49,180
Well, there's like ways you can get a D&D table that like has like a screen on it, but it's pretty expensive

480
00:26:49,180 --> 00:26:51,180
Whoa?

481
00:26:51,180 --> 00:26:57,660
TV basically and then plugging it in and yeah, I can't wait to put all my drinks and foods on it to my TV

482
00:26:57,660 --> 00:27:02,340
Yeah, well, no you put like it does not not on mine. This is not people want to hear this

483
00:27:02,340 --> 00:27:04,780
so

484
00:27:04,780 --> 00:27:09,620
You have the three things you can do you have two moves you can do before the scene. I just like pretty imminent can I?

485
00:27:11,180 --> 00:27:14,100
Can I propose a chant that the workers are saying?

486
00:27:14,100 --> 00:27:19,180
Oh, well, I said it or I said a couple seconds ago and everyone was talking and no one heard it

487
00:27:19,180 --> 00:27:20,100
And I thought it was pretty good

488
00:27:20,100 --> 00:27:25,000
What was it some of those who some of those who work forces are the same that burn bosses?

489
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:30,300
Okay, that's good. So I'll add that good the other chant. They have they have a couple moves

490
00:27:30,300 --> 00:27:34,740
I can do all right one of the chance they can do is they do that this other saying that outside

491
00:27:34,740 --> 00:27:39,420
They do that this land is your land, but the jib jab one. Okay, George W Bush and John Kerry

492
00:27:39,420 --> 00:27:43,780
I have all the lyrics for in case I need to use that.

493
00:27:43,780 --> 00:27:45,220
Yeah, I remember that one.

494
00:27:45,220 --> 00:27:49,740
Yeah, I do too. But so, you can either, you have three moves.

495
00:27:49,740 --> 00:27:51,740
Are they doing okay, boomer?

496
00:27:51,740 --> 00:27:58,900
Troops, they're doing that a lot. Traps and Trentel, just Intel, but I just like the TR

497
00:27:58,900 --> 00:28:02,460
thing and I couldn't think of anything that was similar. So with troops...

498
00:28:02,460 --> 00:28:03,460
Trespassing.

499
00:28:03,460 --> 00:28:06,820
No, because, well, I guess if you're trespassing on your own property, I wouldn't say that.

500
00:28:06,820 --> 00:28:07,820
Oh, wait.

501
00:28:07,820 --> 00:28:12,380
gathering Intel so you either you either you know buff your troops so you give

502
00:28:12,380 --> 00:28:15,180
them buffs on rolls because the way it's gonna work is each round they're gonna

503
00:28:15,180 --> 00:28:19,540
like clash and then you can give them like a buff on the rolls that they do

504
00:28:19,540 --> 00:28:25,260
you could set traps so that traps you can set at any part in the factory or outside

505
00:28:25,260 --> 00:28:28,780
the factory before the siege and like just have that ready for the different

506
00:28:28,780 --> 00:28:34,420
entrances if an Intel is you can pick one of the locations on the map and roll

507
00:28:34,420 --> 00:28:38,800
investigation and each you can roll and then I'll tell you information that you

508
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:43,580
gather from that we can roleplay that out as well yeah what about troops traps try

509
00:28:43,580 --> 00:28:47,500
to get Intel try to get Intel yeah let's do that's better that is way better yeah

510
00:28:47,500 --> 00:28:52,940
try to get into try to get it teaching no it needs to be true tree try to get

511
00:28:52,940 --> 00:29:03,340
reaching until yeah preaching try to get Intel fan ways ang ways a Rick no so yeah

512
00:29:03,340 --> 00:29:09,040
We that those are three you can choose from and you have to you can do now traps you guys have stuff in your like

513
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:13,140
For your character like you is particularly have something. That's a very obvious trap is in

514
00:29:13,140 --> 00:29:19,140
But I also have a list of home alone traps that you guys can set if you want to do as well

515
00:29:19,140 --> 00:29:24,240
So you can either come up with a trap on your own or I can give you trap ideas or if you just want to like

516
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:25,840
Add the buff to your the troops

517
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:29,820
So cuz what's gonna happen is wanna indiscriminately slaughter all these workers

518
00:29:29,820 --> 00:29:36,240
So you do that to each of these guys want to completely just destroy every single one of them basically be doing a d20

519
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:38,520
contest against each other and

520
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:41,460
After three wins on one side or the other side

521
00:29:41,460 --> 00:29:45,780
Then that group is defeated so if crap so

522
00:29:45,780 --> 00:29:51,200
Like you guys can add a buff to these guys or you can also go there and fight with them

523
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:56,300
With the pinky toes with the pinky toes and like you know try to help like wipe out one of the do we get a gun?

524
00:29:56,300 --> 00:30:02,660
wipeout yeah wipeout oh my god we can set up a wipeout course you imagine if you

525
00:30:02,660 --> 00:30:08,940
for the for the workers wipeout course and that's how we get that's the job

526
00:30:08,940 --> 00:30:14,340
that's how we get them gone so smart and then also I will say though so like you

527
00:30:14,340 --> 00:30:19,300
know you can plan for all these moves but like I have I have traps that the

528
00:30:19,300 --> 00:30:24,740
workers have set up of their own for when we go outside and there for and the

529
00:30:24,740 --> 00:30:29,180
the whole factory has not i know that it is a little so like you just have to be

530
00:30:29,180 --> 00:30:30,540
ready for

531
00:30:30,540 --> 00:30:32,180
anything but if you if you

532
00:30:32,180 --> 00:30:34,980
preventing these guys from getting in will make whatever you have to deal

533
00:30:34,980 --> 00:30:38,180
with in the factory easier i'm going to have a question about what are my

534
00:30:38,180 --> 00:30:42,380
characters abilities yet so i can create a a canon early to return to think

535
00:30:42,380 --> 00:30:45,740
do i have to do i have to man it there is a like automatic is like magical

536
00:30:45,740 --> 00:30:50,660
automatic okay it doesn't say uh... doesn't say i don't agree i i i have not

537
00:30:50,660 --> 00:30:53,860
really are can i haven't done like artificer

538
00:30:53,860 --> 00:30:56,220
ever just goes it was a great if too

539
00:30:56,220 --> 00:31:02,400
so like a roots but i think the i think the artist is a good for a mad at me see

540
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:06,460
uh... which keeps so i mean but i like to have to look at the engineer

541
00:31:06,460 --> 00:31:08,620
is in a way when i say all valor

542
00:31:08,620 --> 00:31:12,200
killed roger to kill the time to accuse johnson i didn't know that there was a

543
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:14,980
guy and and and and risk it's dwarfs

544
00:31:14,980 --> 00:31:18,660
it is a dwarf can't adore or there's no dwarves in this incident is america

545
00:31:18,660 --> 00:31:20,100
dwarf

546
00:31:20,100 --> 00:31:23,540
it's not a we're not in middle earth or or is not it says it's a deal nor

547
00:31:23,540 --> 00:31:24,520
moons

548
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:26,100
regard uh...

549
00:31:26,100 --> 00:31:29,860
the land of isaac i actually cause the can to activate if you're within sixty

550
00:31:29,860 --> 00:31:33,560
feet of it so they said it's a truth in sixty feet okay

551
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:36,020
because i think we could do a whole wipeout course and i could just put a

552
00:31:36,020 --> 00:31:39,500
flamethrower at the end of it for a new and get you know you know you and

553
00:31:39,500 --> 00:31:40,420
yes

554
00:31:40,420 --> 00:31:44,700
yeah so what you can i could be like you sure are your hot stuff

555
00:31:44,700 --> 00:31:46,020
that's right so yeah

556
00:31:46,020 --> 00:31:48,540
we're not the spring of mistletoe

557
00:31:48,540 --> 00:31:49,540
Oh, I know why.

558
00:31:49,540 --> 00:31:50,540
Trying to kiss.

559
00:31:50,540 --> 00:31:51,540
Jordy's right there.

560
00:31:51,540 --> 00:31:52,540
He's got his lips puckered.

561
00:31:52,540 --> 00:31:56,580
Oh, I'm not trying to kiss another man.

562
00:31:56,580 --> 00:31:57,580
And he's a child.

563
00:31:57,580 --> 00:31:58,580
What are you talking about?

564
00:31:58,580 --> 00:31:59,580
He's also a boy.

565
00:31:59,580 --> 00:32:02,420
You're telling me I have to kiss a boy?

566
00:32:02,420 --> 00:32:07,420
So you have, if you guys want to do like a wipeout course.

567
00:32:07,420 --> 00:32:08,420
That's my immediate idea.

568
00:32:08,420 --> 00:32:10,660
I feel like that's a pretty good idea.

569
00:32:10,660 --> 00:32:11,660
I think that's a really good idea.

570
00:32:11,660 --> 00:32:12,660
Can we continue to be entertained?

571
00:32:12,660 --> 00:32:13,660
And so that's the question.

572
00:32:13,660 --> 00:32:17,140
And we can watch it from up on the catwalk.

573
00:32:17,140 --> 00:32:18,940
I either put... here's what I'll say.

574
00:32:18,940 --> 00:32:19,940
Yeah!

575
00:32:19,940 --> 00:32:20,940
If you're gonna put a wipeout course...

576
00:32:20,940 --> 00:32:21,940
Sounds bussin'!

577
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:22,940
You have to pick...

578
00:32:22,940 --> 00:32:24,940
I like the sound of that.

579
00:32:24,940 --> 00:32:25,940
What is that?

580
00:32:25,940 --> 00:32:26,940
Bussin'?

581
00:32:26,940 --> 00:32:27,940
It's a new word I came up with.

582
00:32:27,940 --> 00:32:28,940
It's in my lexicon!

583
00:32:28,940 --> 00:32:29,940
Completely in my lexicon!

584
00:32:29,940 --> 00:32:36,180
You can choose one of the areas to put it in.

585
00:32:36,180 --> 00:32:39,540
Now, if you put it outside, you know, then that...

586
00:32:39,540 --> 00:32:43,140
Can we do, for a wipeout course, can we just do one obstacle in each room and have it be

587
00:32:43,140 --> 00:32:45,000
one long course?

588
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,400
I would say that that will use both your moves if you do that.

589
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:54,280
I kind of just want to do it in one of these main factory areas because, you know, you

590
00:32:54,280 --> 00:32:58,960
drive by when you're a kid, you drive by like treatment plants and like factories and stuff

591
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:02,080
and you're like, "God, I would love for there to be a water slide or some kind of

592
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:03,080
giant pooch."

593
00:33:03,080 --> 00:33:09,080
I will also say that will be effective because like these two rooms especially are like massive

594
00:33:09,080 --> 00:33:14,400
and like will probably, like they are going to go into either this room or like they're

595
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:16,040
they're going to end up in this room at some point because they're going to

596
00:33:16,040 --> 00:33:20,440
storm the executive yeah okay I will say it the trap here that is like a like a

597
00:33:20,440 --> 00:33:23,920
good way to start deterring them as they can we do can we do a wipeout course in

598
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:27,520
one room and then an evil haunted amusement park in the other one haunted

599
00:33:27,520 --> 00:33:30,600
house that's a really good idea I think haunted house is more likely to be a

600
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:33,360
little like a roller coaster and they think it's really get in and they're

601
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:38,320
and then we're gonna be all our workers are out and then it scares them you want

602
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:42,160
to do a scary dark ride. Yeah, a ghost jumps out. I would say you could do something where

603
00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:47,480
it's like, if you want to fool off, it's like a wisdom saving throw. People will still die

604
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:52,560
of fright. I want to do the white belt first, but I also want to be in a sniper nest. And

605
00:33:52,560 --> 00:33:56,840
I want to be picking them off if they win. You can position yourself for, I think, you

606
00:33:56,840 --> 00:34:01,920
don't have like a ranged weapon though. No, I have a sprig of mistletoe. You could throw

607
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:05,760
a missile. He has a ranged weapon. I have a lot of ranged weapons. Because he's the Iron

608
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:10,840
man I have three javelins you have three javelins I do have water skin I'm sorry

609
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:14,520
you do have three javelins as true I've been doing this for like and a skim tar

610
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:19,200
you have to talk into the mic patches um you say what tarred a skim tarred

611
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:25,880
scimitar scimitar skim tarred are you seriously calling it that so you can

612
00:34:25,880 --> 00:34:30,480
also perch yourself like if you want to Pat I mean I knew the language of the

613
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:35,240
1890s was coarse and and rather uninclusive but seriously Pat you can

614
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:40,840
also like use your turns in this siege to like walk along the the you know yeah

615
00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:44,360
find a gun well I don't know what I was trying to do in the office when I was

616
00:34:44,360 --> 00:34:47,480
investigating trying to find a gun yeah yeah I feel like the exact trying to

617
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:51,160
find a sniper or something it have like I hit your elbow on this part of the

618
00:34:51,160 --> 00:34:55,880
wall can I make can I make a cannon you can make a cannon you can use you'll be

619
00:34:55,880 --> 00:34:59,520
able to control it if I give it to him I think you can make a range cannon I

620
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:04,280
think it just has to be I think he just has to just makes me the

621
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:11,280
the

622
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:15,140
an arcane firearm or I don't know what any of this means should you should make me

623
00:35:15,140 --> 00:35:18,520
about it doesn't matter we'd also don't play by that or the or the Spartan laser

624
00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:21,080
I will say that you can make him a can and would be cool

625
00:35:21,080 --> 00:35:25,640
on laser okay blicky here's here the up here your options a flamethrower

626
00:35:25,640 --> 00:35:29,080
mmm a force ballista which I think is what you want

627
00:35:29,080 --> 00:35:32,520
that's a great go and then a protector

628
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:36,140
yeah probably want the middle one yeah you're going for a course ballista

629
00:35:36,140 --> 00:35:41,080
yeah that shoots bolts of force okay well it was a bear fifty cal

630
00:35:41,080 --> 00:35:42,080
Yeah, that's fine.

631
00:35:42,080 --> 00:35:43,080
Okay, cool.

632
00:35:43,080 --> 00:35:46,040
So you got a four, yeah, he makes you a Barrett .50 cal with his Tony Stark genius.

633
00:35:46,040 --> 00:35:47,600
From Modern Warfare 2.

634
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:50,040
Who the hell is Tony Stark?

635
00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:51,360
The name's Robert Downey Jr.

636
00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:52,360
And he wants to attack with it.

637
00:35:52,360 --> 00:35:53,360
And I'm Iron Man.

638
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:56,080
And I'm Dan and Fudd.

639
00:35:56,080 --> 00:35:58,800
When he wants to attack with it, can you just...

640
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:00,480
And I just learned how to spell that.

641
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:01,840
Yeah, you do the roll for it.

642
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:02,840
Okay, cool.

643
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:05,160
And then, yeah, what individual actions do you guys...

644
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:10,200
I'm also 400 pounds and 5'2".

645
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:12,980
So the gun is, looks very small on me.

646
00:36:12,980 --> 00:36:16,520
When you say, when you say whatever individual action, you've decided on the obstacle course

647
00:36:16,520 --> 00:36:17,520
now?

648
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:20,800
I mean if you guys want to, I was just saying like just to, because we're in that, but if

649
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:25,560
you guys are down for the obstacle course and then either get intel, buff the troops,

650
00:36:25,560 --> 00:36:28,360
or do one other thing, and then each of you can do an individual action.

651
00:36:28,360 --> 00:36:30,440
I would like to do obstacle course I feel like, right?

652
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:34,920
Yeah I think we should do the obstacle course, and if we also have an individual action.

653
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:40,920
I'm 6'5" about 420 pounds and I would like to maybe do some intel gathering, see if I

654
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:41,920
can sneak through it.

655
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:42,920
Okay, cool.

656
00:36:42,920 --> 00:36:43,920
So what you can do is you can pick.

657
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:46,560
You didn't need to say your height.

658
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:49,920
You can pick any of these, you can pick one of these rooms.

659
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:50,920
8'100".

660
00:36:50,920 --> 00:36:54,880
You can pick any one of these rooms or regions.

661
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:57,480
So these are the four regions and then you can pick any one of these rooms.

662
00:36:57,480 --> 00:36:58,480
You already like.

663
00:36:58,480 --> 00:36:59,480
I'm east coast baby.

664
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:02,480
Yeah, you want to go to the east region like here?

665
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:07,680
Yeah, so the the East loading bay. Yes. Okay, cool. We'll we'll do that in a second Pat

666
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:15,480
What do you want to do and that's that's the Intel gathering I'm also you also can do an individual action after I'm gonna investigate the

667
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:17,140
lobby

668
00:37:17,140 --> 00:37:19,240
Okay, you guys okay. All right, so that's

669
00:37:19,240 --> 00:37:24,480
No, because that's like your Intel gathering. So he's doing that the wake what's an individual thing you want you to prepare?

670
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:31,100
So you can prepare like you can like put yourself on the like ledge and ready to snipe out. Yeah, I can do that

671
00:37:31,100 --> 00:37:36,400
I just set up a gun yeah, you know that cool. Which which which where does the obstacle course end?

672
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:41,460
The obstacle course will end like right by the like entrance to the executive office

673
00:37:41,460 --> 00:37:46,160
Okay, pick up this the whole suspenders, so I'm gonna what this is walkway right here is a walk

674
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:46,720
It's a walkway

675
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:52,360
But it only looks out into the suspenders part of the factory like the walk so this side on this side until the stairway

676
00:37:52,360 --> 00:37:55,900
Where the executive office is right? Yeah, you can like perch yourself here. Yeah

677
00:37:55,900 --> 00:38:00,980
I'm perching my gun towards the end so that they think that they are probably going to

678
00:38:00,980 --> 00:38:03,080
go up there and that I'm just picking them off.

679
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:04,080
Got it, cool.

680
00:38:04,080 --> 00:38:05,380
So you'll perch your cannon over here.

681
00:38:05,380 --> 00:38:06,380
Yeah.

682
00:38:06,380 --> 00:38:07,380
Okay, cool.

683
00:38:07,380 --> 00:38:09,660
I'll put PC because that's Pat Cannon.

684
00:38:09,660 --> 00:38:12,940
And then you, you want to investigate.

685
00:38:12,940 --> 00:38:13,940
I want to investigate.

686
00:38:13,940 --> 00:38:15,460
I want to see.

687
00:38:15,460 --> 00:38:17,660
My guess is that there's some kind of.

688
00:38:17,660 --> 00:38:18,660
And Danon Cannon.

689
00:38:18,660 --> 00:38:22,580
Can we just take a moment to thank God that we're in 1890 and there's no SJWs at this

690
00:38:22,580 --> 00:38:23,580
time of the century.

691
00:38:23,580 --> 00:38:24,580
Oh, thank God.

692
00:38:24,580 --> 00:38:25,580
Thank God.

693
00:38:25,580 --> 00:38:29,180
like to thank God for that so let's go let's go straight to the east there are

694
00:38:29,180 --> 00:38:37,700
SJWs in the 1800s. Will you let me sneak? Are you just slave jerkin workers?

695
00:38:37,700 --> 00:38:42,300
That did nothing that was nothing so I'm gonna go here and I'm gonna check out this

696
00:38:42,300 --> 00:38:45,740
slave Joe I'm gonna check out this he's ruining can you stop tell me yeah stop

697
00:38:45,740 --> 00:38:51,980
I'm gonna check out this truck. That work? You should do that more often.

698
00:38:51,980 --> 00:39:11,800
to

699
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:17,140
16-wheeler trucks. And I'm trying to think, I'm going to need a disguise. I'll be a bag

700
00:39:17,140 --> 00:39:21,640
of laundry. And you're a bag of laundry. And I'm sliding like a worm. Yeah, it's Phantom

701
00:39:21,640 --> 00:39:27,400
Chain. You're just sliding around. And you, yeah, you could see. Actually, I move more

702
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:33,080
like prop hunt. I just completely float around. You could see on the other side of the truck,

703
00:39:33,080 --> 00:39:37,920
like the pinky toe forces sort of sizing up and some of the workers like getting rallied

704
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:41,280
up and you can hear inside the truck some shuffling.

705
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:44,400
What do you say sizing up? Are they like spinning their fists?

706
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:51,800
Yeah, they're all winding up. They're all getting ready. And you can hear some rustling

707
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:58,640
around in this truck. And when you peek inside, if you want to peek inside, I'd say roll stealth.

708
00:39:58,640 --> 00:39:59,640
I'm rolling stealth.

709
00:39:59,640 --> 00:40:00,640
Yeah.

710
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:04,160
You just peeked my, you peeked my fucking interest, I'll tell you that much.

711
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:05,160
I did.

712
00:40:05,160 --> 00:40:13,700
stealth role was a complete 10 okay it's not that stealthy um but maybe it could

713
00:40:13,700 --> 00:40:19,100
be it could you if I want me to win

714
00:40:19,100 --> 00:40:27,360
okay cool um so yeah no no it's a good it's a good that you look in they are

715
00:40:27,360 --> 00:40:32,300
they are all facing the wall but it is workers who is workers their workers are

716
00:40:32,300 --> 00:40:35,360
hiding in there and they're all standing up and just they got a one on

717
00:40:35,360 --> 00:40:40,860
perceptions of the wall of the truck and you are like a bag of flour just poking

718
00:40:40,860 --> 00:40:48,960
your head or a bag of laundry and they're in there you hear one of them

719
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:54,340
say oh boy I hope they don't I hope they don't look in the other trucks - that's

720
00:40:54,340 --> 00:40:58,000
good in Trento that's good Trento I'm going to really

721
00:40:58,000 --> 00:40:59,660
That is some fire fucking trinto.

722
00:40:59,660 --> 00:41:01,760
Speaking of fire, can I really quickly,

723
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:03,460
'cause I have a torch in my inventory,

724
00:41:03,460 --> 00:41:05,300
can I light it, just throw it under this truck?

725
00:41:05,300 --> 00:41:06,140
I've been looking at the other trucks too,

726
00:41:06,140 --> 00:41:07,620
they like know you looked.

727
00:41:07,620 --> 00:41:10,740
Sorry, just realizing how stupid what I said was.

728
00:41:10,740 --> 00:41:11,820
Yeah, you can do that.

729
00:41:11,820 --> 00:41:13,260
(laughing)

730
00:41:13,260 --> 00:41:14,100
Sorry.

731
00:41:14,100 --> 00:41:15,380
I hope they don't look at the other ones too,

732
00:41:15,380 --> 00:41:16,820
they know you're looking.

733
00:41:16,820 --> 00:41:18,140
There's nothing they can do about it.

734
00:41:18,140 --> 00:41:19,340
(laughing)

735
00:41:19,340 --> 00:41:20,940
Yeah, they're looking the other way.

736
00:41:20,940 --> 00:41:21,860
So yeah, what do you wanna do?

737
00:41:21,860 --> 00:41:22,700
Sorry.

738
00:41:22,700 --> 00:41:23,740
I wanna light my torch, I have a torch in my inventory.

739
00:41:23,740 --> 00:41:24,580
Yes, you do.

740
00:41:24,580 --> 00:41:25,940
And I'd like to just kind of like,

741
00:41:25,940 --> 00:41:32,060
like toss it under the truck and let me see and I also have rope. I'd like to really quickly

742
00:41:32,060 --> 00:41:36,660
tie a knot on the door of the truck so that they're all trapped in there.

743
00:41:36,660 --> 00:41:37,660
Yeah.

744
00:41:37,660 --> 00:41:39,700
You basically like to boil these minimum wage workers alive.

745
00:41:39,700 --> 00:41:40,860
Yeah, you can absolutely do that.

746
00:41:40,860 --> 00:41:41,860
All right, I'm going to do that.

747
00:41:41,860 --> 00:41:45,180
Yeah, cool. Okay. Yeah, you do that. You tie it up. You close it.

748
00:41:45,180 --> 00:41:46,660
Let me remove my torch.

749
00:41:46,660 --> 00:41:48,540
Yeah, and it is...

750
00:41:48,540 --> 00:41:50,420
Oh, I have ten of them.

751
00:41:50,420 --> 00:41:57,660
You don't hear anything yet, but they're about to get my inventory.

752
00:41:57,660 --> 00:41:58,980
And that's, okay, so that's cool.

753
00:41:58,980 --> 00:41:59,980
So that's...

754
00:41:59,980 --> 00:42:02,820
Do I have enough time to prop hunt back into the executive office?

755
00:42:02,820 --> 00:42:03,820
Yes, you do.

756
00:42:03,820 --> 00:42:04,820
That's like your move.

757
00:42:04,820 --> 00:42:08,260
I'll say that's your like individual move and your like intel.

758
00:42:08,260 --> 00:42:09,260
So all right, let me...

759
00:42:09,260 --> 00:42:10,820
Wait, where'd my pencil go?

760
00:42:10,820 --> 00:42:11,820
You've dropped it.

761
00:42:11,820 --> 00:42:12,820
I dropped me pencil.

762
00:42:12,820 --> 00:42:13,820
It's right on the ground right there.

763
00:42:13,820 --> 00:42:14,820
He dropped his pencil.

764
00:42:14,820 --> 00:42:15,820
He dropped it.

765
00:42:15,820 --> 00:42:16,820
That's cool.

766
00:42:16,820 --> 00:42:18,980
So you guys took out that truck.

767
00:42:18,980 --> 00:42:25,860
So that'll be good for you. Okay, cool. You have the obstacle course set up. You used Intel

768
00:42:25,860 --> 00:42:31,700
and used your turn to take out some of the truck, one of the trucks. And now...

769
00:42:31,700 --> 00:42:33,060
What are those circles you drew?

770
00:42:33,060 --> 00:42:36,340
Those are just like obstacle course things. I remember that's what's...

771
00:42:36,340 --> 00:42:37,340
Okay.

772
00:42:37,340 --> 00:42:39,540
Wait, we don't get to see these people die? They're done?

773
00:42:39,540 --> 00:42:42,460
Well, no. I haven't even got to take my turn yet.

774
00:42:42,460 --> 00:42:44,100
Yeah, yeah. Don't worry.

775
00:42:44,100 --> 00:42:48,900
ahead. I want to be just on the floor in the thick of it wherever I think wherever

776
00:42:48,900 --> 00:42:51,580
it seems like they're about to start rushing I want to be waiting through

777
00:42:51,580 --> 00:42:56,580
them and just machine gunning their heads off. I have a punch card that I've

778
00:42:56,580 --> 00:43:00,060
punched out that's about the like holes in it like you know when you write a

779
00:43:00,060 --> 00:43:04,740
word on your Scantron test yeah it says kill and I put it in my mouth and I chew it up

780
00:43:04,740 --> 00:43:08,180
and I swallow it. So you guys don't want to but you so you guys are not

781
00:43:08,180 --> 00:43:12,620
stationing outside. You know I'll station in the lobby maybe.

chapeau. Oh, Hassan the chapeau. Yeah. And he goes, "Charge!" Oh dear. And yeah, it begins.

810
00:45:31,820 --> 00:45:36,900
The siege begins. This Turkish man in a sequined suit is running towards us. So everybody roll

811
00:45:36,900 --> 00:45:41,420
initiative. Everybody roll initiative and we're going to follow this initiative order

812
00:45:41,420 --> 00:45:47,220
for actions going forward. Okay. Do I get initiative bonus? Do I get a reroll if I don't like my

813
00:45:47,220 --> 00:46:02,740
I got a 14. My initiative. I have an 18 initiative. Nice. I got five. Okay, so hold on a second.

814
00:46:02,740 --> 00:46:16,300
Me. Me. He got four. I don't know what happened, but out of nowhere he just said 14. 14. 18.

815
00:46:16,300 --> 00:46:23,820
I got a five. Charlie Brown reference. Yep. I got a five. I got a five. I got a 14. I got an 18.

816
00:46:23,820 --> 00:46:30,940
I got a five. I got a five. I got a five. I got a five. I got a five. I got a five. I got a five.

817
00:46:30,940 --> 00:46:36,380
You know what I would say? I'd say Charlie Brown. Rocks can actually be worth quite a

818
00:46:36,380 --> 00:46:39,660
quite a lot if you if you get the right kind of rock and you sell it to a place such as a

819
00:46:39,660 --> 00:46:45,340
of the Smithsonian. So maybe you could or you could flip that rock. Yep. You could.

820
00:46:45,340 --> 00:46:50,620
Yeah. How about this? With enough pressure? Try carving it into a figurine. Yeah.

821
00:46:50,620 --> 00:46:53,820
Do something beautiful with it. With enough pressure you could turn that rock into a diamond. Or artistic. Okay.

822
00:46:53,820 --> 00:46:58,740
So let's go. I'm gonna start doing rolls to see what's gonna happen here. And I'm

823
00:46:58,740 --> 00:47:02,600
doing the jelly roll. This is for the north end. It's a straight d20 contest right now

824
00:47:02,600 --> 00:47:09,380
with no bonuses. South end I mean. And then we're gonna go west, north, east. So

825
00:47:09,380 --> 00:47:11,380
So this is for the workers.

826
00:47:11,380 --> 00:47:12,380
I didn't even roll.

827
00:47:12,380 --> 00:47:13,380
19.

828
00:47:13,380 --> 00:47:14,380
You dropped that.

829
00:47:14,380 --> 00:47:15,380
You dropped that.

830
00:47:15,380 --> 00:47:16,380
You reroll that right now.

831
00:47:16,380 --> 00:47:17,380
Don't roll that.

832
00:47:17,380 --> 00:47:18,380
Don't roll it on paper.

833
00:47:18,380 --> 00:47:19,380
That's bullshit.

834
00:47:19,380 --> 00:47:20,380
Roll it on the...

835
00:47:20,380 --> 00:47:21,380
You're a fucker.

836
00:47:21,380 --> 00:47:22,380
Alright, so that's one win for the workers.

837
00:47:22,380 --> 00:47:23,740
They got a win.

838
00:47:23,740 --> 00:47:25,740
And one loss for them.

839
00:47:25,740 --> 00:47:26,740
We'll go over here.

840
00:47:26,740 --> 00:47:27,740
Oh my lord.

841
00:47:27,740 --> 00:47:28,740
I take my shirt off.

842
00:47:28,740 --> 00:47:29,740
Okay, 13 for the workers.

843
00:47:29,740 --> 00:47:30,740
And oh man, shit.

844
00:47:30,740 --> 00:47:31,740
The pinky toe.

845
00:47:31,740 --> 00:47:35,460
I take my shirt off and a mouse falls out from unpointed.

846
00:47:35,460 --> 00:47:38,940
I bet this fucking antifa piece of shit made the workers super mad.

847
00:47:38,940 --> 00:47:43,820
supercharged I did not instead of our guys yeah because of his antifo

857
00:48:28,040 --> 00:48:33,240
guys are up you can do things so you can see here in the south end south west and

858
00:48:33,240 --> 00:48:37,440
and north. The workers are actually fighting back pretty good against the Pinky Toes right

859
00:48:37,440 --> 00:48:43,940
now. On the east side where you burned this, they are winning right now. But is there anything

860
00:48:43,940 --> 00:48:44,940
you guys want to do?

861
00:48:44,940 --> 00:48:46,620
Oh, the Pinkertons are winning.

862
00:48:46,620 --> 00:48:50,860
Yeah, the Pinky Toes are winning over here. Is there anything you guys want to do? Change

863
00:48:50,860 --> 00:48:55,180
your positions? Move somewhere? Or do you guys want to stay as is right now?

864
00:48:55,180 --> 00:48:58,820
I look upon the Pinkertons.

865
00:48:58,820 --> 00:49:02,180
You can definitely see the losing here and the winning here.

866
00:49:02,180 --> 00:49:06,620
I see the ones that are losing and I say, "Hey, everybody!

867
00:49:06,620 --> 00:49:07,620
Look at this!"

868
00:49:07,620 --> 00:49:09,740
As a morale boost and I do the Charleston.

869
00:49:09,740 --> 00:49:13,660
Okay, I'm going to roll.

870
00:49:13,660 --> 00:49:14,660
Do I roll performance?

871
00:49:14,660 --> 00:49:20,020
Yeah, roll performance.

872
00:49:20,020 --> 00:49:22,220
And do a real life performance.

873
00:49:22,220 --> 00:49:23,900
I have to go pee real quick.

874
00:49:23,900 --> 00:49:24,900
Go.

875
00:49:24,900 --> 00:49:25,900
Go.

876
00:49:25,900 --> 00:49:26,900

878
00:49:27,900 --> 00:49:28,900
Go.

879
00:49:28,900 --> 00:49:29,900
Go.

880
00:49:29,900 --> 00:49:37,020
That's a 15. Okay, 15. Yeah. And I need you to do a real performance of the Charleston too

881
00:49:37,020 --> 00:49:40,780
to prove that you deserve that 15. Let's see it.

882
00:49:40,780 --> 00:49:46,860
It's not even the Charleston, but that was pretty good.

883
00:49:46,860 --> 00:49:48,380
Was that the-- that wasn't the Charleston?

884
00:49:48,380 --> 00:49:50,140
You have to-- I don't want to do it, but it's--

885
00:49:50,140 --> 00:49:51,820
Dude, I do want to do it.

886
00:49:51,820 --> 00:49:52,300
Right now.

887
00:49:52,300 --> 00:49:54,220
You can't correct somebody on the Charleston.

888
00:49:54,220 --> 00:49:54,460
It's this.

889
00:49:57,820 --> 00:50:00,140
Whoa, okay. He knows how to do the job.

890
00:50:00,140 --> 00:50:05,180
All right, this whole, this whole, it's a city, it's a city, it was a sting operation.

891
00:50:05,180 --> 00:50:11,740
We're done. Yeah, I've been, I've, that would honestly, yeah, that's fine. If that ended my

892
00:50:11,740 --> 00:50:16,860
life. Um, so you got a plus, so I'll say that with that 15, that adds a plus one to their next role.

893
00:50:16,860 --> 00:50:22,220
Nice. Um, so that's useful. Um, anything we do with a bonus action with my bonus action,

894
00:50:23,340 --> 00:50:25,340
I do the truffle truffle.

895
00:50:25,340 --> 00:50:26,340
You do the truffle truffle.

896
00:50:26,340 --> 00:50:27,340
They're still looking at me.

897
00:50:27,340 --> 00:50:28,340
Yeah.

898
00:50:28,340 --> 00:50:29,340
So do I just roll again?

899
00:50:29,340 --> 00:50:32,340
No, because you wouldn't be able to do that again as a bonus action.

900
00:50:32,340 --> 00:50:38,340
Okay, then with my bonus action, are there any workers near me right now?

901
00:50:38,340 --> 00:50:41,340
Well, with your... so I can tell you what you can do with your bonus action.

902
00:50:41,340 --> 00:50:47,340
I look at one of the workers and I say, "I'm going to come down there and give you a knuckle sandwich, I tell you what!"

903
00:50:47,340 --> 00:50:49,340
Shoot the cannon.

904
00:50:49,340 --> 00:50:50,340
Well, the cannon is purged.

905
00:50:50,340 --> 00:50:52,340
And the cannon would be an action at the other point.

906
00:50:52,340 --> 00:50:54,340
Yeah, it would be his action right now was raising around.

907
00:50:54,340 --> 00:50:56,340
I can control it with a bonus action.

908
00:50:56,340 --> 00:50:58,340
Yeah, you can control it with a bonus action. He did the Charleston,

909
00:50:58,340 --> 00:51:00,340
which did help give a bonus.

910
00:51:00,340 --> 00:51:02,340
Um...

911
00:51:02,340 --> 00:51:04,340
So, he could have attacked, but

912
00:51:04,340 --> 00:51:06,340
he did the Charleston.

913
00:51:06,340 --> 00:51:08,340
And then, yeah, anything...

914
00:51:08,340 --> 00:51:10,340
Let's see, what's the... that was...

915
00:51:10,340 --> 00:51:12,340
'cause you were first, so Tuck is next.

916
00:51:12,340 --> 00:51:14,340
Tuck is in the bathroom.

917
00:51:14,340 --> 00:51:16,340
Tuck is peeping.

918
00:51:16,340 --> 00:51:18,340
Where the hell is Tuck?

919
00:51:18,340 --> 00:51:20,340
There's Tuck.

920
00:51:20,340 --> 00:51:26,860
I need to go to the bathroom now. Okay, copying. Tuck, you are up. I'm up? Yeah, so basically

921
00:51:26,860 --> 00:51:31,940
I'm asking. I didn't really establish where I was after. So Pat moved over here. Okay.

922
00:51:31,940 --> 00:51:38,060
And he did the Charleston for the for the for the pinky toes and they liked it and so

923
00:51:38,060 --> 00:51:43,180
they get a plus one in their next role. You are, I mean, you kind of like went back to

924
00:51:43,180 --> 00:51:47,900
the executive office. So I mean, you can go anywhere you want to go in the factory or you

925
00:51:47,900 --> 00:51:52,400
can go outside and try to help one of the fights but this is your time to pick your move.

926
00:51:52,400 --> 00:51:53,740
These guys already have a +1 right?

927
00:51:53,740 --> 00:51:58,300
They just got a +1 to their next roll yes.

928
00:51:58,300 --> 00:52:00,740
So it's basically just a straight up d20 check between these two.

929
00:52:00,740 --> 00:52:03,660
I'm going to go give them another +.

930
00:52:03,660 --> 00:52:05,540
Ok so what do you want to do?

931
00:52:05,540 --> 00:52:10,900
Do you want to try to boost morale or do you want to go and fight with them or what?

932
00:52:10,900 --> 00:52:14,700
I'd like to go to the front door and I have three javelins in my inventory.

00:54:15,840 --> 00:54:20,000
well i have a spell called catapult i didn't even see, i didn't look at my spell

972
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:21,980
holy crapping fuck

973
00:54:21,980 --> 00:54:25,420
holy crapping fuck, you have stuff when you rage, use some stuff

974
00:54:25,420 --> 00:54:30,920
my god i have thunder wave, i straight up have pokemon, i fuck up my voice

975
00:54:30,920 --> 00:54:35,120
uh... i guess i'm gonna just try and shoot a firebolt, at the crowd? yeah

976
00:54:35,120 --> 00:54:39,800
indiscriminately, yeah roll at the workers, just roll the attack for firebolt

977
00:54:39,800 --> 00:54:46,060
So we're doing like kind of mob combat. So okay, like see here if it beats the AC it'll do like a certain amount damage

978
00:54:46,060 --> 00:54:48,060
That is 19. Yeah

979
00:54:48,060 --> 00:54:50,240
Can we get a worker count really quick?

980
00:54:50,240 --> 00:54:53,360
Well, okay. Yeah sure. So right now there is

981
00:54:53,360 --> 00:54:55,840
so there's

982
00:54:55,840 --> 00:54:57,840
lost one here, so there's like

983
00:54:57,840 --> 00:55:01,080
35 Pinkerton's here and

984
00:55:01,080 --> 00:55:06,920
40 workers. I just want a total war. This seems like a crazy cantrip. There's like a hundred. There's 159 right?

985
00:55:06,920 --> 00:55:08,920
This does 2d10 damage?

986
00:55:08,920 --> 00:55:09,420
What?

987
00:55:09,420 --> 00:55:10,600
And it's a cantrip?

988
00:55:10,600 --> 00:55:12,200
That's 12 damage.

989
00:55:12,200 --> 00:55:15,900
Um, yeah, I mean it's, it's, it's, you're, yeah you're strong.

990
00:55:15,900 --> 00:55:16,400
Um...

991
00:55:16,400 --> 00:55:16,900
Bruh!

992
00:55:16,900 --> 00:55:19,100
Wait, this guy knows magic?

993
00:55:19,100 --> 00:55:20,600
What the fuck?

994
00:55:20,600 --> 00:55:21,600
It's not magic.

995
00:55:21,600 --> 00:55:22,100
Oh wait, wow.

996
00:55:22,100 --> 00:55:23,100
How much damage did you do?

997
00:55:23,100 --> 00:55:24,600
Uh, it looks like 12.

998
00:55:24,600 --> 00:55:25,100
12, yeah.

999
00:55:25,100 --> 00:55:25,600
Nice, okay, yeah.

1000
00:55:25,600 --> 00:55:26,600
This is, this is, I, I, I...

1001
00:55:26,600 --> 00:55:29,100
I didn't know I was working with some kind of Satanist!

1002
00:55:29,100 --> 00:55:32,600
Alright, no, I opened up, I opened up a vent on my Iron Man suit,

1003
00:55:32,600 --> 00:55:35,600
and it shoots out just, there, there...

1004
00:55:35,600 --> 00:55:37,600
there has just been fire in the

1005
00:55:37,600 --> 00:55:40,120
it's nice in the whole so i will affect

1006
00:55:40,120 --> 00:55:41,920
and i guess i was in a trend attack i

1007
00:55:41,920 --> 00:55:43,760
just like say it feels a little hot in

1008
00:55:43,760 --> 00:55:45,800
here you open up the belt

1009
00:55:45,800 --> 00:55:51,640
both of my that's a lot better

1010
00:55:51,640 --> 00:55:53,760
yeah the workers are mostly children

1011
00:55:53,760 --> 00:55:55,720
like screaming they're going to take

1012
00:55:55,720 --> 00:55:57,520
minus two to their next role now against

1013
00:55:57,520 --> 00:55:58,720
us these guys have plus two these guys

1014
00:55:58,720 --> 00:55:59,560
minus two

1015
00:55:59,560 --> 00:56:02,520
ok so we're going to now run it run it

1016
00:56:02,520 --> 00:56:03,520
again.

1017
00:56:03,520 --> 00:56:06,520
I love having a siege.

1018
00:56:06,520 --> 00:56:09,520
Minus two, plus two, oh wow.

1019
00:56:09,520 --> 00:56:12,240
Okay, we're going to re-roll.

1020
00:56:12,240 --> 00:56:13,240
They tied.

1021
00:56:13,240 --> 00:56:14,240
Who tied?

1022
00:56:14,240 --> 00:56:15,240
These two tied.

1023
00:56:15,240 --> 00:56:16,240
We're going to re-roll.

1024
00:56:16,240 --> 00:56:17,240
Wait, and they got plus two?

1025
00:56:17,240 --> 00:56:18,960
Yeah, and then they got minus two and they tied.

1026
00:56:18,960 --> 00:56:19,960
Holy crap.

1027
00:56:19,960 --> 00:56:20,960
Okay, and then...

1028
00:56:20,960 --> 00:56:25,520
Alright, they won this one.

1029
00:56:25,520 --> 00:56:27,200
Which one of ours is worse?

1030
00:56:27,200 --> 00:56:28,200
Dude, hell yeah.

1031
00:56:28,200 --> 00:56:29,920
I knew that plus one would help.

1032
00:56:29,920 --> 00:56:31,760
How much did they win by?

1033
00:56:31,760 --> 00:56:33,800
I mean, it won by a lot.

1034
00:56:33,800 --> 00:56:35,920
We tied it with all that crap.

1035
00:56:35,920 --> 00:56:36,920
That's right.

1036
00:56:36,920 --> 00:56:37,920
That's right.

1037
00:56:37,920 --> 00:56:38,920
Okay.

1038
00:56:38,920 --> 00:56:43,120
And then it did help, but not like the most ever, but it helped.

1039
00:56:43,120 --> 00:56:44,120
Bitch.

1040
00:56:44,120 --> 00:56:45,120
Okay.

1041
00:56:45,120 --> 00:56:47,360
And all right.

1042
00:56:47,360 --> 00:56:49,240
They won here too.

1043
00:56:49,240 --> 00:56:50,240
That's another win.

1044
00:56:50,240 --> 00:56:51,240
Oh no.

1045
00:56:51,240 --> 00:56:52,240
Not the workers.

1046
00:56:52,240 --> 00:56:53,240
Oh no.

1047
00:56:53,240 --> 00:56:54,240
Our guys won again.

1048
00:56:54,240 --> 00:56:56,800
You guys won, workers lost here.

1049
00:56:56,800 --> 00:56:57,800
This is so easy.

1050
00:56:57,800 --> 00:57:09,800
I feel like a war general workers. This is the coolest here. Unfortunately, we

1051
00:57:09,800 --> 00:57:12,960
should do a siege every time. I wish there was a video game where you could

1052
00:57:12,960 --> 00:57:17,920
do this, but I don't care for violence and maybe some kind of party item and

1053
00:57:17,920 --> 00:57:20,800
yeah, but pinky toes one here, okay,

1054
00:57:22,400 --> 00:57:29,760
So the piggy toes are doing very well on this side on the east side.

1055
00:57:29,760 --> 00:57:36,160
The workers look like they might break through on this side.

1056
00:57:36,160 --> 00:57:37,600
I'm not sure that will happen.

1057
00:57:37,600 --> 00:57:40,360
The north side and then the west side.

1058
00:57:40,360 --> 00:57:41,680
The west side it's tied.

1059
00:57:41,680 --> 00:57:42,680
This side it's also tied.

1060
00:57:42,680 --> 00:57:44,000
But they have advantages.

1061
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:46,200
And there's that bathroom there?

1062
00:57:46,200 --> 00:57:48,360
Yeah, the bathroom had a noise right now.

1063
00:57:48,360 --> 00:57:51,080
I just start indiscriminately firing around.

1064
00:57:51,080 --> 00:57:55,640
I told you you don't know you didn't hear well. I'm already indiscriminately firing

1065
00:57:55,640 --> 00:58:02,480
Indiscriminately fire after the first thing just luckily you just throw up perfectly. I throw a perfect cannonball

1066
00:58:02,480 --> 00:58:08,540
Okay, at I'm just shooting. It's actually a horse bolt office a force bolt not a cannonball

1067
00:58:08,540 --> 00:58:12,640
Okay, so who goes first here? He goes first you're gonna start indiscriminately just shooting

1068
00:58:12,640 --> 00:58:15,800
Well, and maybe I hit the bathroom

1069
00:58:16,640 --> 00:58:23,140
And I yell like maybe we should check every toy with to see if I have any more heirs to my fortune

1070
00:58:23,140 --> 00:58:30,120
I'll let you fire indiscriminately roll a d20 to see if let's do like a luck roll. Let's have fun with this roll

1071
00:58:30,120 --> 00:58:32,680
Do you 20 if you get 15 or higher? I'll say you hit the bathroom

1072
00:58:32,680 --> 00:58:35,760
If you don't you might hit something else. What is that?

1073
00:58:35,760 --> 00:58:40,360
There's not a 13. We don't want to destroy the dam. So you're shooting indiscriminately

1074
00:58:41,160 --> 00:58:43,320
uh... just around and uh...

1075
00:58:43,320 --> 00:58:45,320
you hit this thing

1076
00:58:45,320 --> 00:58:46,320
and you see like

1077
00:58:46,320 --> 00:58:51,320
like a steam like ice cold steam come out and it cools the glue

1078
00:58:51,320 --> 00:58:53,480
no he really did that

1079
00:58:53,480 --> 00:58:54,280
and you see

1080
00:58:54,280 --> 00:58:57,720
not him breaking the machine away

1081
00:58:57,720 --> 00:59:00,360
it's giving recklessness

1082
00:59:00,360 --> 00:59:02,640
and one ton destruction

1083
00:59:02,640 --> 00:59:05,680
it's the indiscriminate firing for me

1084
00:59:05,680 --> 00:59:07,400
you see a nose poke out of the machine

1085
00:59:07,400 --> 00:59:11,040
uh... and it is indeed the snow miser

1086
00:59:11,040 --> 00:59:13,040
the

1087
00:59:13,040 --> 00:59:14,640
just

1088
00:59:14,640 --> 00:59:15,940
still mystery

1089
00:59:15,940 --> 00:59:18,040
this is the only way

1090
00:59:18,040 --> 00:59:21,000
the

1091
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:22,640
what is he doing here

1092
00:59:22,640 --> 00:59:24,240
guys all the hell

1093
00:59:24,240 --> 00:59:25,440
the

1094
00:59:25,440 --> 00:59:32,040
well i i i was told you about that i saw his no-fly zeros is used to cool the

1095
00:59:32,040 --> 00:59:34,360
glue as it's attached to the

1096
00:59:34,360 --> 00:59:37,520
the hooks are attached and i do that dance with him to see the job this is

1097
00:59:37,520 --> 00:59:42,760
his job because he go only workers not yeah he's like spinning around you

1098
00:59:42,760 --> 00:59:46,280
what's going on here I don't remember what the snow miser sounds he's he's had

1099
00:59:46,280 --> 00:59:49,000
more like a

1100
00:59:49,000 --> 01:00:00,600
white Christmas mr. snow mr. icicle mr. ten below

1101
01:00:00,600 --> 01:00:14,960
I'm so clutch think about this we might want to go and throw Dan and into the

1102
01:00:14,960 --> 01:00:20,040
furnace. Why? I have a feeling if the Snow Miser is nearby there might be another

1103
01:00:20,040 --> 01:00:24,800
Miser in the building. Why would you throw me in the furnace? Why don't we put the

1104
01:00:24,800 --> 01:00:29,140
Snow Miser? Why don't we use the Snow Miser? Because you seem to be that you'd

1105
01:00:29,140 --> 01:00:32,200
be able to sniff this kind of thing out pretty well. No. I'm thinking you should

1106
01:00:32,200 --> 01:00:37,000
hop up in that. Well I know the Snow Miser. So far you are the Miser Fizer.

1107
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:43,040
Fizer? Miser Finder. So the Snow Miser is saying, says, "Say what's going on here?" "Hey I wish I could tell you!"

1108
01:00:43,040 --> 01:00:52,960
attack the front building you guys now as a bonus action can command the snow

1109
01:00:52,960 --> 01:01:00,840
miser oh my god that is literally my dream we're gonna win okay cool you've

1110
01:01:00,840 --> 01:01:08,400
unlocked the snow miser okay so now we'll go to your turd you thought he was

1111
01:01:08,400 --> 01:01:14,160
a bad guy but turns out to be our our pawn he's good AF there's one snow miser in

1112
01:01:14,160 --> 01:01:17,640
every factory that helps I just found out I didn't really know about the

1113
01:01:17,640 --> 01:01:24,440
technology of the day yeah you are seriously giving ice I would like to go

1114
01:01:24,440 --> 01:01:30,400
to this bit part of the north side not the snow miser freezing all the north

1115
01:01:30,400 --> 01:01:36,120
side so you can go to the dock yeah and can I bring this no miser with me as a

1116
01:01:36,120 --> 01:01:39,240
a bonus action you can command him to come with you and so it could be just

1117
01:01:39,240 --> 01:01:46,320
both of you post on my door I'm mr. snow I know singing no I hate singing no the

1118
01:01:46,320 --> 01:01:49,880
calm miser lives in the bathroom

1119
01:01:49,880 --> 01:01:58,440
that's disgusting you got time I'm too much

1120
01:02:00,200 --> 01:02:04,200
You're stuck in the Snowmiser now, posted it at the loading dock.

1121
01:02:04,200 --> 01:02:07,200
At the loading dock you don't see anything going on, by the way.

1122
01:02:07,200 --> 01:02:10,200
There's activity going on outside, though, yes.

1123
01:02:10,200 --> 01:02:11,200
You used your...

1124
01:02:11,200 --> 01:02:12,200
I'm already kind of anticipating...

1125
01:02:12,200 --> 01:02:16,200
You just moved and used a bonus action, so you can attack if you have a ranged weapon.

1126
01:02:16,200 --> 01:02:22,200
Can I do any kind of... I was thinking of having the Snowmiser maybe build some kind of ice wall to kind of reinforce this part of it.

1127
01:02:22,200 --> 01:02:24,200
He has an ice wall spell you can use.

1128
01:02:24,200 --> 01:02:26,200
Because we're so close to losing it.

1129
01:02:26,200 --> 01:02:31,200
Yeah, I would say you can use the ice wall. You can command me uses ice wall spell as your action

1130
01:02:31,200 --> 01:02:37,200
Hey while he's doing that you have a make me a snow cone. I have type 2 diabetes. That's fine

1131
01:02:37,200 --> 01:02:42,660
So what this will do is bear I'm the first I'm patient zero for type 2 diabetes the doors

1132
01:02:42,660 --> 01:02:47,440
So even if they win this fight against the pinky toes, they still will have

1133
01:02:47,440 --> 01:02:53,760
One turn where they have to break this down so that you can delay them invading

1134
01:02:53,760 --> 01:02:59,280
okay put a bunch of your body stuff all over this yeah you say oh and one more

1135
01:02:59,280 --> 01:03:04,240
thing there's a another guy in the bathrooms that somebody should do that

1136
01:03:04,240 --> 01:03:19,160
on their turn yeah yeah and it is your turn okay you guys are both in the lobby

1137
01:03:19,160 --> 01:03:25,700
so you and RDJ so you probably you could have told him that anyway okay okay I

1138
01:03:25,700 --> 01:03:28,640
just wanted I'm right by the bathroom once I'd already been over here I just

1139
01:03:28,640 --> 01:03:32,000
kind of realized you're gonna head over to the bathroom over here I am okay are

1140
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:35,080
you I know sure the bathroom is right here we got it there we have to go

1141
01:03:35,080 --> 01:03:39,480
around if there's two spies now that if I can other spies here if I can do if I

1142
01:03:39,480 --> 01:03:42,600
can do it in my turn then yeah I'll do it yeah you can move okay make that move

1143
01:03:42,600 --> 01:03:48,480
and I I have I have um I have like a buzzsaw in my stomach mm-hmm like Gigan

1144
01:03:48,480 --> 01:03:57,480
from Godzilla. Fuck you. Yeah, it's cool. And I have to, I have to, it doesn't spin on its own. I have to crank a thing inside of my suit to spin it.

1145
01:03:57,480 --> 01:04:05,480
And I'm cranking it and I'm spinning it and I just walk through the bathroom wall. Yeah, you see, you see a handful, a handful. It's also a music box.

1146
01:04:05,480 --> 01:04:11,480
You see a handful of child, of child laborers who are coming in to attack you. Um, so you can roll an attack roll against them.

1147
01:04:11,480 --> 01:04:14,160
I have a trash compactor of my stomach like Wally also

1148
01:04:14,160 --> 01:04:20,520
And I'm going to make a kid cube yeah, whatever this attack would be roll that

1149
01:04:20,520 --> 01:04:27,200
Well, it's a 19 plus something. I mean that's gonna hit whatever it is, but this is your it's gonna

1150
01:04:27,200 --> 01:04:30,780
Be like you're just regular this is me crushing all the children into a cube

1151
01:04:30,780 --> 01:04:37,120
I know, but I'm just and then you're gonna roll it like a die like yeah, I make that into a spell. It's my power source

1152
01:04:37,800 --> 01:04:43,040
True that's my battery as soon as that happens you could make that into hotter

1153
01:04:43,040 --> 01:04:49,040
You can make that into scorching ray or you can make that into fire bolting. I thought scorching ray lived in the furnace

1154
01:04:49,040 --> 01:04:55,260
Bruh, I mean all the fireball has more damage than scorching ray

1155
01:04:55,260 --> 01:05:03,040
Squirting ray well scorching ray you can you can hurl three of them. Oh, okay

1156
01:05:03,040 --> 01:05:08,160
I'll do I'll do cool. I'll solve any sense you Sullivan is inside you have him Sullivan is still in my cannon

1157
01:05:08,160 --> 01:05:11,380
I'm saving him. Yeah, he's he's important and I can breathe

1158
01:05:11,380 --> 01:05:16,400
Yeah, oh, sorry about that. Yeah, I close the compartment

1159
01:05:16,400 --> 01:05:25,120
Okay, so that's that's what 66 damage well you did 66 image D 6 6 D 6

1160
01:05:27,320 --> 01:05:33,100
So on it you make a range spell attack for each ray, so you would target oh three of them with this

1161
01:05:33,100 --> 01:05:36,980
Okay, it's mob. It's mob rules. So like there's should I roll two more time

1162
01:05:36,980 --> 01:05:41,560
I think you could just roll for full damage cuz mob rules. Okay. Hey, whatever you say, whatever you say

1163
01:05:41,560 --> 01:05:48,440
Okay, let's see here that's nine I don't want to make you roll for each race annoying

1164
01:05:48,440 --> 01:05:53,600
16 18 what's that? What's that's a six? Okay, that's 24 damage that up, but

1165
01:05:55,520 --> 01:06:00,160
Oh, it's a 2, so no, it's not 24 damage. It's 20 damage.

1166
01:06:00,160 --> 01:06:03,840
Okay, that's still enough. Yeah, you just like incinerate the spies that were in here.

1167
01:06:03,840 --> 01:06:04,640
The spy children.

1168
01:06:04,640 --> 01:06:06,000
I, no, I'd cubed them.

1169
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:11,360
You cube these children. You have children cubes now ready for you.

1170
01:06:11,360 --> 01:06:13,600
It's plugged into my back.

1171
01:06:13,600 --> 01:06:20,000
Yeah, and so that's great. Okay, now we'll go back to what we were,

1172
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:22,240
back to the siege stuff, okay?

1173
01:06:24,240 --> 01:06:25,960
and okay

1174
01:06:25,960 --> 01:06:29,160
pinky toes won this one yo

1175
01:06:29,160 --> 01:06:33,360
close to close to defeating the this is gonna be so for a king easy one

1176
01:06:33,360 --> 01:06:35,000
okay that

1177
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:39,720
say this is an absolutely an epic win there was a lot of the other day

1178
01:06:39,720 --> 01:06:43,200
well i do want to my eyes not the workers and now that i have a little

1179
01:06:43,200 --> 01:06:46,000
over here that's an epic way and

1180
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:46,520

Check this out. Check this out. Check this out.

1183
01:06:51,840 --> 01:06:53,840
Leroy Jenkins!

1184
01:06:53,840 --> 01:06:56,840
That might come in handy. Wait us.

1185
01:06:56,840 --> 01:07:00,840
Alright, so, okay. There's still...

1186
01:07:00,840 --> 01:07:06,840
Alright. So still, there's no definitive win or loss yet on either side.

1187
01:07:06,840 --> 01:07:07,840
But, I will tell you.

1188
01:07:07,840 --> 01:07:08,840
Who's winning?

1189
01:07:08,840 --> 01:07:11,840
Winning, you're winning on the South.

1190
01:07:11,840 --> 01:07:14,840
You're winning in the East.

1191
01:07:14,840 --> 01:07:16,840
You said it's three wins before three losses?

1192
01:07:16,840 --> 01:07:22,280
Yeah, it's winning on the south and east you're still losing on the north and west

1193
01:07:22,280 --> 01:07:27,280
But you stopped you almost lost in the north completely, but you didn't this time

1194
01:07:27,280 --> 01:07:33,120
So it's one but it's one one more win for each of those people for the person who's winning

1195
01:07:33,120 --> 01:07:37,160
Okay, I feel like we should because the north side is barricaded a little bit

1196
01:07:37,160 --> 01:07:43,080
I feel like we should focus everything on giving buffs to this. Yes. Well, I was gonna take out those spies in the bathroom

1197
01:07:43,640 --> 01:07:47,640
He just did yeah, he did okay, then I'm gonna turn

1198
01:07:47,640 --> 01:07:51,920
Turn my cannon towards the barricade I

1199
01:07:51,920 --> 01:07:57,880
Guess what the barricade no not the barricade. Why you want to break the barrel? I'm gonna shoot over the barricade

1200
01:07:57,880 --> 01:08:00,780
No, we want to go west side. There's no barricade there, okay?

1201
01:08:00,780 --> 01:08:11,760
This is a serious west side story, so you're gonna go to that's a reference

1202
01:08:11,760 --> 01:08:21,000
I'm serving cunt. I'm serving cunt I say. Sir you just set my sides into orbit. Well I'm

1203
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:29,400
completely serving cunt. That's completely based. I'll tell you. The workers are fake

1204
01:08:29,400 --> 01:08:41,400
and gay. So you're gonna go over to the west side here. Child I'm serving cunt. Okay. It's

1205
01:08:41,400 --> 01:08:44,000
Jimmy Stewart saying that is really funny.

1206
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:50,700
So a miracle, so I go serving con we're all

1207
01:08:50,700 --> 01:08:55,800
sorry, we're here, but every time a every time a bell rings, an angel is

1208
01:08:55,800 --> 01:08:56,400
serving,

1209
01:08:56,400 --> 01:09:01,300
so you want to go to the west side here. I didn't say it in Jimmy Stewart's

1210
01:09:01,300 --> 01:09:05,300
voice. God damn it. He just was saying his idea for a tick tock or something.

1211
01:09:05,300 --> 01:09:10,000
It seems yeah every time an angel every time a bell rings an angel serving

1212
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:14,280
It's over. It's done. Yeah. All right. So you're going to the West side here.

1213
01:09:14,280 --> 01:09:17,320
Okay. So I bring my cannon over there to the West side,

1214
01:09:17,320 --> 01:09:19,640
to the West Danon's cannon on the West side.

1215
01:09:19,640 --> 01:09:26,560
As you're walking along, this is actually very good timing. Um, you,

1216
01:09:26,560 --> 01:09:28,760
you on accident. Um,

1217
01:09:28,760 --> 01:09:33,320
but I had something set in motion after three rounds and they just failed a major

1218
01:09:33,320 --> 01:09:35,800
stealth check. Uh,

1219
01:09:36,400 --> 01:09:42,320
You hear Jordy and his MILF inside Jordy's office as you're walking along the outside.

1220
01:09:42,320 --> 01:09:44,160
I don't really want to hear what they're doing in there.

1221
01:09:44,160 --> 01:09:45,280
My guess is that he's a betrayer.

1222
01:09:45,280 --> 01:09:45,760
Make the noises.

1223
01:09:45,760 --> 01:09:46,720
I think he's a betrayer.

1224
01:09:46,720 --> 01:09:48,800
I hear the noises.

1225
01:09:48,800 --> 01:09:53,280
You hear him press what's... he got a wand.

1226
01:09:53,280 --> 01:09:58,960
You hear him say, "I've got to press my Matt Lauer button," and he presses it.

1227
01:09:58,960 --> 01:10:03,440
And the bathroom in his office starts to pop out.

1228
01:10:03,440 --> 01:10:05,840
You hear workers popping out.

1229
01:10:05,840 --> 01:10:11,920
I hear all the workers popping out and I'm like, "What in the blazes? I gotta do something

1230
01:10:11,920 --> 01:10:12,920
about this!"

1231
01:10:12,920 --> 01:10:15,160
That MILF's having babies at an incredible rate!

1232
01:10:15,160 --> 01:10:16,160
Holy crap!

1233
01:10:16,160 --> 01:10:19,160
And that MILF... Gianna Michaels.

1234
01:10:19,160 --> 01:10:20,160
And they're coming out...

1235
01:10:20,160 --> 01:10:21,160
No, shut up.

1236
01:10:21,160 --> 01:10:22,160
And I'm just right there with the...

1237
01:10:22,160 --> 01:10:23,240
I don't think they've ever done anything together.

1238
01:10:23,240 --> 01:10:25,520
I have the gun pointed at them, right?

1239
01:10:25,520 --> 01:10:27,160
That working relationship between Jordi and Gianna what?

1240
01:10:27,160 --> 01:10:30,360
I have the gun pointed at them already? I'm like right there?

1241
01:10:30,360 --> 01:10:33,400
You can't... I will let you... If you wanna like... Instead of like peering out on the

1242
01:10:33,400 --> 01:10:36,240
west side you want to stop what you're doing and like sort of post yourself

1243
01:10:36,240 --> 01:10:40,480
like above them and yes they're coming out the door yeah below you just like

01:11:03,140 --> 01:11:04,240
and I saw that.

1249
01:11:04,240 --> 01:11:09,840
Doing yes, so when I roll weird, you should roll the attack roll for the

1250
01:11:09,840 --> 01:11:13,440
cannon. You go, okay. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. He rolls attack. He's you give you

1300
01:14:06,080 --> 01:14:13,440
and Snow Mizer got a 7. So it's a 7-11. That's a lucky number. Snake Eye is watching you.

1301
01:14:13,440 --> 01:14:18,040
guys play Motorhead? No. Okay, what do you guys play? I'm on the West Side, right? Sing your song.

1302
01:14:18,040 --> 01:14:28,020
Oh. Sometimes I feel like I don't have a partner. Sometimes I feel like my only

1303
01:14:28,020 --> 01:14:38,700
friend is the city I live in. The city of angels. Won't we as I am, together we cry.

1304
01:14:38,700 --> 01:14:47,860
and then you hear the Snowmiser in the back goes and he goes and then I do the

1305
01:14:47,860 --> 01:14:57,580
whole song. Yeah yeah. Well I got a baby named Dino. You gotta give it to your mama.

1306
01:14:57,580 --> 01:15:03,140
So you're gonna attack them? No I'm just I'm imbuing them with with West Coast

1307
01:15:03,140 --> 01:15:07,060
spirit. Oh these are your enemies? No you misunderstood what I was doing I'm

1308
01:15:07,060 --> 01:15:09,060
I'm coming over here to help these guys.

1309
01:15:09,060 --> 01:15:12,060
(mimics a baby crying)

1310
01:15:12,060 --> 01:15:12,900
So, wait, wait.

1311
01:15:12,900 --> 01:15:14,540
Why would I just walk up to them and sing at them?

1312
01:15:14,540 --> 01:15:16,220
Oh, I'm sorry, I got confused there.

1313
01:15:16,220 --> 01:15:17,040
Okay, so-- I know.

1314
01:15:17,040 --> 01:15:18,700
So you walked up over here yourself.

1315
01:15:18,700 --> 01:15:20,420
I don't even know about the toilet men.

1316
01:15:20,420 --> 01:15:21,260
I haven't even seen them.

1317
01:15:21,260 --> 01:15:22,100
Okay, so you walked out over here.

1318
01:15:22,100 --> 01:15:23,140
Can I inform him?

1319
01:15:23,140 --> 01:15:23,980
Can I just yell it?

1320
01:15:23,980 --> 01:15:26,060
Inform him. No, no, it's fine now.

1321
01:15:26,060 --> 01:15:27,540
Inform me. About the toilet men.

1322
01:15:27,540 --> 01:15:28,380
I need to know about the toilet guys right now.

1323
01:15:28,380 --> 01:15:29,740
That's good enough.

1324
01:15:29,740 --> 01:15:31,180
That's good enough that we'll give them

1325
01:15:31,180 --> 01:15:32,020
a plus one on their next roll.

1326
01:15:32,020 --> 01:15:34,660
Jor-E-N-G-O-R-E. Snow, Snow-Mizer.

1327
01:15:34,660 --> 01:15:35,500
Holy shit.

1328
01:15:35,500 --> 01:15:42,500
you are all my god. Why didn't you see that? I'm here. Yeah. Okay. Are we're

1329
01:15:42,500 --> 01:15:46,800
losing? Can I get to either the north or the west easily from where I am? I

1330
01:15:46,800 --> 01:15:49,800
don't I can't tell where the doors are in this. You know full movement, right?

1331
01:15:49,800 --> 01:15:53,000
The north the north you'd have to both of them. You probably have to use your

1332
01:15:53,000 --> 01:15:55,300
full movement. You're okay. What about these people coming out of the

1333
01:15:55,300 --> 01:15:59,500
bathroom? Also, do I know what do I know about them? I mean if you walk if

1334
01:15:59,500 --> 01:16:02,700
you're walking up, I guess I just killed a bunch of guys in a in a bathroom.

1335
01:16:02,700 --> 01:16:05,340
I'm coming out and you hear gunfire too from them.

1336
01:16:05,340 --> 01:16:06,700
- I guess I'll go towards them.

1337
01:16:06,700 --> 01:16:07,540
- Okay, cool.

1338
01:16:07,540 --> 01:16:10,140
So you're over here where Tuck was

1339
01:16:10,140 --> 01:16:11,140
or where I thought he was.

1340
01:16:11,140 --> 01:16:12,660
And so do you want to attack them?

1341
01:16:12,660 --> 01:16:16,860
- Yeah, I'll shoot all my, whatever the three one is.

1342
01:16:16,860 --> 01:16:17,700
- He's gonna shoot as well.

1343
01:16:17,700 --> 01:16:18,940
- Oh, the Scorching Ray.

1344
01:16:18,940 --> 01:16:19,780
- Yeah.

1345
01:16:19,780 --> 01:16:20,860
- The Scorching Ray.

1346
01:16:20,860 --> 01:16:22,980
- Yeah, that might be, check your spell slots

1347
01:16:22,980 --> 01:16:24,100
'cause I don't know how many spell slots you have.

1348
01:16:24,100 --> 01:16:24,940
- Oh shit, true.

1349
01:16:24,940 --> 01:16:26,620
I completely forgot it.

1350
01:16:26,620 --> 01:16:27,460
- Yeah.

1351
01:16:27,460 --> 01:16:28,280
- Fucking shit.

1352
01:16:28,280 --> 01:16:30,540
- I would do a cantrip probably.

1353
01:16:30,540 --> 01:16:32,140
I would do Firebolt maybe 'cause in,

1354
01:16:32,140 --> 01:16:36,740
or you can just use it. Oh yeah, because I'll do I'll do firebolt. I forgot about

1355
01:16:36,740 --> 01:16:40,880
spell slots. I just dnd beyond I pressed a spell slot. It's been loading the whole

1356
01:16:40,880 --> 01:16:45,740
time. Yeah, I'll just look at this. That's very it's this freaking app needs a

1357
01:16:45,740 --> 01:16:49,360
loading screen like this to make a check in a checkbox. What is technology come to

1358
01:16:49,360 --> 01:16:52,860
nowadays that makes me I look at that and I just say bro the way this iPhone is

1359
01:16:52,860 --> 01:16:59,100
functioning. I'm glad we're in the 1890s right now. It's completely fucked. All

1360
01:16:59,100 --> 01:17:01,060
all right that's a sixteen plus

1361
01:17:01,060 --> 01:17:01,900

1362
01:17:01,900 --> 01:17:04,040
ninety-two yamina had some

1363
01:17:04,040 --> 01:17:05,980
roper damage

1364
01:17:05,980 --> 01:17:08,660
merits except seven from you right

1365
01:17:08,660 --> 01:17:11,100
yes so it doesn't want to be a

1366
01:17:11,100 --> 01:17:15,900
was attend image okay cool yet there's only one worker left and he's injured

1367
01:17:15,900 --> 01:17:17,900
uh... and the fire come to

1368
01:17:17,900 --> 01:17:19,040
i say

1369
01:17:19,040 --> 01:17:23,700
i say say hello to my little friend and then i and then it's the little friend

1370
01:17:23,700 --> 01:17:25,020
is the child cube

1371
01:17:25,020 --> 01:17:30,060
in me and it has a face a child's face on it still on the fire yeah and the child

1372
01:17:30,060 --> 01:17:34,780
the fire comes out of the child's mouth yeah yeah yeah they're horrified they're

1373
01:17:34,780 --> 01:17:39,980

1374
01:17:39,980 --> 01:17:45,180
with yeah and they're gone um okay so jordy is in the toilet right now jordy

1375
01:17:45,180 --> 01:17:47,580
escaped somewhere he went into the toilet he might have

1376
01:17:47,580 --> 01:17:51,260
went somewhere let's see what happens now i hope he's not on the east side now

1377
01:17:51,260 --> 01:17:53,500
because if he goes to the east side that would probably be

1378
01:17:53,500 --> 01:17:56,860
pretty bad for us because he can sabotage because he knows the layout of the

1379
01:17:56,860 --> 01:18:00,140
workplace. Nobody even went in the obstacle course yet.

1380
01:18:00,140 --> 01:18:03,420
I know. I hope he got teleported to the obstacle course.

1381
01:18:03,420 --> 01:18:07,020
Oh. I just checked he wasn't there. Uh oh. What are you saying? Uh oh.

1382
01:18:07,020 --> 01:18:10,620
He's saying uh oh. It's tied again over here.

1383
01:18:10,620 --> 01:18:15,100
Oh no. And then. You tricked us. You made us go away from there and then you tied

1384
01:18:15,100 --> 01:18:18,220
it. He's working against us. I'm not working against you.

1385
01:18:18,220 --> 01:18:21,980
Color me fucking shocked. All right. He's got an I voted sticker. The workers won

1386
01:18:21,980 --> 01:18:26,140
here. I did not have an eye voted sticker. Even with my song they

1387
01:18:26,140 --> 01:18:29,120
won? Yeah, it wasn't enough. So the workers won over here. I

1388
01:18:29,120 --> 01:18:32,360
mean, they'll be less than them, but they're gonna start to

1389
01:18:32,360 --> 01:18:35,640
storm. I guess they're gonna have to go they're gonna have to

1390
01:18:35,640 --> 01:18:40,460
go through the south through the north entrance up here. Now the

1391
01:18:40,460 --> 01:18:45,700
north workers let's see how they do. Loose loose. They lose and

1392
01:18:45,700 --> 01:18:49,500

1393
01:18:49,500 --> 01:18:57,180
know my oh my god my bad me reading wrong not me reading wrong mm-hmm okay it's

1394
01:18:57,180 --> 01:19:02,160
the illiteracy for me yes no way we roll there was a tie that's completely the

1395
01:19:02,160 --> 01:19:08,780

01:19:17,220 --> 01:19:21,980
Worker West, East, East, East is the beastest.

1399
01:19:21,980 --> 01:19:27,900
And the Pinky Toes, being good contractors that they are, they go, "Well, my work here

1400
01:19:27,900 --> 01:19:28,900
is done."

1401
01:19:28,900 --> 01:19:31,460
And they brush their hands off and they walk out.

1402
01:19:31,460 --> 01:19:34,180
But you guys beat all the workers here.

1403
01:19:34,180 --> 01:19:36,860
And so now the workers are coming in over here and now we're back at the top of the

1404
01:19:36,860 --> 01:19:38,140
order.

1405
01:19:38,140 --> 01:19:40,260
So where am I right now?

because you went out here and you sang for them and then they all died and now the workers are

1447
01:21:49,400 --> 01:21:53,960
coming towards you. Okay, so I'm right completely away from them. You could fight them too,

1448
01:21:53,960 --> 01:21:59,880
you're a barbarian. Okay, well, then I, oh, can I beckon the Snowmizer to come help?

1449
01:21:59,880 --> 01:22:04,040
Yes, you can use that as a bonus action. So the thing is if your bonus action would be to rage,

1450
01:22:04,040 --> 01:22:06,040
So you won't have the rage if you do that, but you can still get the skill.

1451
01:22:06,040 --> 01:22:07,540
Okay, I want to rage. I want to rage.

1452
01:22:07,540 --> 01:22:09,040
Yeah, I think you should rage.

1453
01:22:09,040 --> 01:22:10,040
Wait.

1454
01:22:10,040 --> 01:22:13,040
Nobody wiped my thong!

1455
01:22:13,040 --> 01:22:14,040
[Laughter]

1456
01:22:14,040 --> 01:22:16,040
And so, how do I click rage?

1457
01:22:16,040 --> 01:22:21,040
Um, so, well, it's just like, it's just an ability, so what's just gonna happen is...

1458
01:22:21,040 --> 01:22:22,040
Hey, bitches.

1459
01:22:22,040 --> 01:22:26,040
Um, you, right now, you have advantage on any strength checks or saving throws, but not attacks.

1460
01:22:26,040 --> 01:22:29,040
You do +2 damage for any melee damage with strength weapons.

1461
01:22:29,040 --> 01:22:31,040
You have resistance to damage now.

1462
01:22:31,040 --> 01:22:35,040
And so you're just gonna do more damage now

1463
01:22:35,040 --> 01:22:35,880
and you're gonna be stronger.

1464
01:22:35,880 --> 01:22:39,440
But you also get some abilities from raging

1465
01:22:39,440 --> 01:22:40,280
with the path of the beast.

1466
01:22:40,280 --> 01:22:41,720
- The form of the beast stuff?

1467
01:22:41,720 --> 01:22:42,800
- Yeah.

1468
01:22:42,800 --> 01:22:44,660
So you also have, until your rage ends,

1469
01:22:44,660 --> 01:22:45,680
you can manifest a natural weapon.

1470
01:22:45,680 --> 01:22:47,200
It counts as a simple melee weapon for you

1471
01:22:47,200 --> 01:22:48,840
and add your strength modifier to the attack

1472
01:22:48,840 --> 01:22:50,200
and damage rolls when you attack with it as normal.

1473
01:22:50,200 --> 01:22:51,520
- Okay, I know what I'm gonna do.

1474
01:22:51,520 --> 01:22:55,440
I would like to, so they're all running at me.

1475
01:22:55,440 --> 01:22:56,800
Are they like in a line pretty much?

1476
01:22:56,800 --> 01:22:58,360
- Yeah, and you have like a tail too.

1477
01:22:58,360 --> 01:23:00,040
- Oh yeah, so that's what I'd like to do

1478
01:23:00,040 --> 01:23:04,600
is I'd like to I'd like to turn around and take my pants off and

1479
01:23:04,600 --> 01:23:07,440
shoot my tail at them to sweep under their legs. Roll an

1480
01:23:07,440 --> 01:23:11,080
attack roll. All right, let's see. Wait, I accidentally rolled

1481
01:23:11,080 --> 01:23:14,120
the damage. Hold on. Let me roll the attack roll instead.

1482
01:23:14,120 --> 01:23:17,320
And my god got and

1483
01:23:17,320 --> 01:23:25,840
14. Okay, that's enough. Now I roll for damage. And I got a

1484
01:23:25,840 --> 01:23:29,280
seven. Nice. Okay, cool. So the workers are coming towards you

1485
01:23:29,280 --> 01:23:35,160
and you pull down your pants and you just whip around and you go "HE'S GOT A TAIL!"

1486
01:23:35,160 --> 01:23:37,160
"PINCHED TAIL!"

1487
01:23:37,160 --> 01:23:39,160
"A MILLION EYES!"

1488
01:23:39,160 --> 01:23:41,160
And so they take some damage.

1489
01:23:41,160 --> 01:23:43,160
"What's that for?"

1490
01:23:43,160 --> 01:23:45,160
They take some damage, so that was good.

1491
01:23:45,160 --> 01:23:49,160
Oh wait, I think that was from the Simpsons talking.

1492
01:23:49,160 --> 01:23:51,160
You add another +2.

1493
01:23:51,160 --> 01:23:53,160
You actually did 9 damage.

1494
01:23:53,160 --> 01:23:55,160
I like Homer.

1495
01:23:55,160 --> 01:23:57,160
I like when Homer says "go."

1496
01:23:57,160 --> 01:23:59,160
I like Mr. Burns.

1497
01:23:59,160 --> 01:24:05,840
Cartoon Network. So that group is now, they're not doing too well. Did I knock them down?

1498
01:24:05,840 --> 01:24:10,000
You knocked down a bunch of them. I saw that talkie the other day, the secret life of pets.

1499
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:15,440
Can I walk them down? And they change the name of the main character. What'd you say?

1500
01:24:15,440 --> 01:24:21,400
The main dog. They change his name. This is like a joke for a ten year old who knows what

1501
01:24:21,400 --> 01:24:25,040
that movie is? If a creature you see. I've never seen that movie. Louis C.K. is the voice

1502
01:24:25,040 --> 01:24:26,820
of the main character.

1503
01:24:26,820 --> 01:24:30,100
So now also if somebody tries to attack you when you have your tail out, you can use your

1504
01:24:30,100 --> 01:24:36,560
reaction to swipe your tail and roll a d8, applying bonus to your AC.

1505
01:24:36,560 --> 01:24:40,100
So basically like, if they try to attack you while you have your tail out, you can be like,

1506
01:24:40,100 --> 01:24:41,100
"Get away!"

1507
01:24:41,100 --> 01:24:42,100
And like, "Bang!"

1508
01:24:42,100 --> 01:24:43,100
Can I swing from the waftas like Nightclaw-la?

1509
01:24:43,100 --> 01:24:44,100
Swing from the waftas!

1510
01:24:44,100 --> 01:24:45,100
Not right now, but in a minute.

1511
01:24:45,100 --> 01:24:46,100
Nightclaw-la!

1512
01:24:46,100 --> 01:24:47,100
I'm like some kind of Nightclaw-la!

1513
01:24:47,100 --> 01:24:48,100
Doing good!

1514
01:24:48,100 --> 01:24:49,100
Claw-la!

1515
01:24:49,100 --> 01:24:50,100
Nightclaw-la!

1516
01:24:50,100 --> 01:24:51,100
You're up now.

1517
01:24:51,100 --> 01:24:52,100
Nightclaw-la!

1518
01:24:52,100 --> 01:24:53,100
You're up now.

1519
01:24:53,100 --> 01:24:54,100
Nightclaw-la!

1520
01:24:54,100 --> 01:25:01,860
up now. Okay, am I what's yeah? How many people are left? There's one. There's like one very

1521
01:25:01,860 --> 01:25:09,220
weak worker here. Okay, you I mean, I guess I'm just gonna well, let's see and mine literally

1528
01:25:38,720 --> 01:25:41,980
Okay, what's your role in?

1529
01:25:41,980 --> 01:25:44,380
What's your role in?

1530
01:25:44,380 --> 01:25:50,140
And I'm gonna cast Thunderwave. Oh, okay. Cool. Yeah, so they're gonna throw a constitution saving throw against that

1531
01:25:50,140 --> 01:25:53,500

1533
01:25:57,220 --> 01:26:04,900
lightning storm and it just yeah I just you can see my writing so the creatures

1534
01:26:04,900 --> 01:26:08,820
they did save so they are gonna take but they're gonna take half damage and

1535
01:26:08,820 --> 01:26:13,820
they're not pushed back but still roll 2d 8 okay under damage or are you up are

1536

1539
01:26:33,060 --> 01:26:36,340
they come up to you they're gonna be they're gonna be less fewer of them yeah

1540
01:26:36,340 --> 01:26:43,140
also the lightning bolt brings the child cube back to life like Frank. It's

1541
01:26:43,140 --> 01:26:48,460
just horrible screaming all right cool. What we're back to the top so all

1542
01:26:48,460 --> 01:26:50,580
right South side South side

1543
01:26:50,580 --> 01:26:52,260
South side

1544
01:26:52,260 --> 01:26:59,060
the dirty South you won yeah, let's fucking go. Yeah, workers are going to

1545
01:26:59,060 --> 01:27:02,260
South side down. So let's fucking go

1546
01:27:02,260 --> 01:27:04,460
North side.

1547
01:27:05,960 --> 01:27:08,160
Uh-uh.

1548
01:27:08,160 --> 01:27:09,160
He flopped it again.

1549
01:27:09,160 --> 01:27:10,160
He just plopped it down.

1550
01:27:10,160 --> 01:27:11,160
He didn't roll up.

1551
01:27:11,160 --> 01:27:12,160
Here, I'll roll for it.

1552
01:27:12,160 --> 01:27:13,160
Do not flop it.

1553
01:27:13,160 --> 01:27:15,520
The DM is in his flop era.

1554
01:27:15,520 --> 01:27:16,520
Then they won.

1555
01:27:16,520 --> 01:27:18,320
That doesn't count because that would be a...

1556
01:27:18,320 --> 01:27:20,120
So the workers won over here.

1557
01:27:20,120 --> 01:27:21,120
What?

1558
01:27:21,120 --> 01:27:22,120
So we're two and two.

1559
01:27:22,120 --> 01:27:23,800
You're two and two.

1560
01:27:23,800 --> 01:27:27,120
You prevented them from coming over and helping them, but they still won.

1561
01:27:27,120 --> 01:27:28,120
Okay, great.

1562
01:27:28,120 --> 01:27:29,120
I'm glad I used my...

1563
01:27:29,120 --> 01:27:30,600
I'm glad I revealed my tale early in the story.

1564
01:27:30,600 --> 01:27:31,600
Whatever.

1565
01:27:31,600 --> 01:27:32,600
Well, no, it's helpful.

1566
01:27:32,600 --> 01:27:33,600
Wait, it's two and two?

1567
01:27:33,600 --> 01:27:34,600
I thought we...

1568
01:27:34,600 --> 01:27:35,600
So what happens now?

1569
01:27:35,600 --> 01:27:36,440
- Are all the fights over?

1570
01:27:36,440 --> 01:27:38,800
- We won Southeast, shout out North Carolina.

1571
01:27:38,800 --> 01:27:41,520
- No, they're still gonna charge.

1572
01:27:41,520 --> 01:27:44,920
The ones who lived are gonna still charge the factory.

1573
01:27:44,920 --> 01:27:45,760
- Oh, okay.

1574
01:27:45,760 --> 01:27:47,440
- So we're back to top of the order now.

1575
01:27:47,440 --> 01:27:48,280
You're up.

1576
01:27:48,280 --> 01:27:49,100
- I heard a beep.

1577
01:27:49,100 --> 01:27:49,940
- Me too.

1578
01:27:49,940 --> 01:27:52,940
- You are, so Pat, you are back here.

1579
01:27:52,940 --> 01:27:56,200
You got these workers to stay with you for one more fight.

1580
01:27:56,200 --> 01:27:58,260
- The workers?

1581
01:27:58,260 --> 01:27:59,100
- Oh, not the workers, sorry.

1582
01:27:59,100 --> 01:28:00,680
You got the pinky toes to stick with you.

1583
01:28:00,680 --> 01:28:03,720
So if you want to, you can try to send them up here to help

1584
01:28:03,720 --> 01:28:07,160
or have them storm the factory now and prepare for--

1585
01:28:07,160 --> 01:28:09,460
- I think probably storm the factory, right?

1586
01:28:09,460 --> 01:28:12,040
- I think that's probably your best move, I would say.

1587
01:28:12,040 --> 01:28:13,560
- Yeah, yeah, I'm gonna have them storm--

1588
01:28:13,560 --> 01:28:15,280
- Can I get a worker account really quickly?

1589
01:28:15,280 --> 01:28:18,660
- Sure, we are at, 'cause they're dead here,

1590
01:28:18,660 --> 01:28:20,500
so that's them there, and then they're dead here.

1591
01:28:20,500 --> 01:28:22,440
So you have now--

1592
01:28:22,440 --> 01:28:24,600
- How many pinker toes?

1593
01:28:24,600 --> 01:28:26,440
- Pinky toes I haven't been keeping track of.

1594
01:28:26,440 --> 01:28:29,600
- I hear an actual Jurassic Park footstep outside right now.

1595
01:28:29,600 --> 01:28:31,240
- I think that's just some kind of loud music.

1596
01:28:31,240 --> 01:28:33,000
- I think it's a serious Godzilla attack.

1597
01:28:33,000 --> 01:28:36,360
stop squeaking. I haven't even been paying attention to the sound outside.

1598
01:28:36,360 --> 01:28:41,760
Where's my counter? Report card. Sorry. Where's my counter? Oh, I'm in the wrong

1599
01:28:41,760 --> 01:28:47,120
document. I'm adding that as a section on your report card. There's a ghost in the

1600
01:28:47,120 --> 01:28:54,920
factory. You have 75 workers left. 75 workers left in you? Oh my god, yeah.

1601
01:28:54,920 --> 01:29:02,360
You're the longest D&D of all time. Yeah, I know. Alright, I'm doing a tactical nuke.

1602
01:29:02,360 --> 01:29:07,320
self-destruct and so now so you where did you go pat you went you brought them in

1603
01:29:07,320 --> 01:29:12,000
here yeah okay cool and then there is still this one worker that's like kind

1604
01:29:12,000 --> 01:29:15,840
of hanging out well there I'll just say obviously obviously they're gonna just

1605
01:29:15,840 --> 01:29:19,520
kill yeah like soon as they he was on the pinky toes walking nobody's even

1606
01:29:19,520 --> 01:29:23,120
though I want to point out again and I'm putting this out to Caleb and Patrick but

1607
01:29:23,120 --> 01:29:27,000
I want patches to like to listen in I'm complaining to you guys can you believe

1608
01:29:27,000 --> 01:29:30,680
no one's even done our obstacle course yet holy crap what do we even spend time

1609
01:29:30,680 --> 01:29:33,880
I'm doing that, but it's not like pointed. It's not directed at

1610
01:29:33,880 --> 01:29:35,920
anybody. It's just like a complaint. I'm making to my

1611
01:29:35,920 --> 01:29:38,560
friends and maybe so I might overhear it and somebody and

1612
01:29:38,560 --> 01:29:42,620
roll a dice and the bathroom they would have maybe done it

1613
01:29:42,620 --> 01:29:45,460
maybe. Yeah, that's true. I guess I totally missed my chance

1614
01:29:45,460 --> 01:29:48,520
Patrick to make three workers go on our obstacle course. Maybe

1615
01:29:48,520 --> 01:29:52,520
you should have a 75. Yeah, maybe we should walk out and

1616
01:29:52,520 --> 01:29:56,420
ask if anyone wants to volunteer. Okay, that's actually

1617
01:29:56,420 --> 01:30:00,120
not that bad of an idea. Hold on your it's almost like the DM

1618
01:30:00,160 --> 01:30:05,000
I've never heard of check offs wipe out. Well, maybe we will play with it at

1619
01:30:05,000 --> 01:30:06,880
maybe the end of ourselves.

1620
01:30:06,880 --> 01:30:10,900
I'm gonna actually I'm gonna go play with it right now. It was where we fun.

1621
01:30:10,900 --> 01:30:15,100
I'm gonna go do it yeah. You can use the rest of your movement to just go

1622
01:30:15,100 --> 01:30:19,500
over here and start playing. That's gonna give you some kind of buff. I

1623
01:30:19,500 --> 01:30:23,260
don't think it's gonna make you buff working out on that. Yeah, you are up

1624
01:30:23,260 --> 01:30:24,200
now

1625
01:30:24,200 --> 01:30:29,500
the top. I'm on the gladiator portion right now, and I don't have anyone to do

1626
01:30:29,520 --> 01:30:32,080
with. It looks like coway muffle.

1627
01:30:32,080 --> 01:30:35,560
So the workers are going to come and try to attack you soon. Um,

1628
01:30:35,560 --> 01:30:38,200
but you can still hold them at bay with your tail. Okay. Wait.

1629
01:30:38,200 --> 01:30:41,160
And I have more beast, uh, abilities. Yes.

1630
01:30:41,160 --> 01:30:43,640
So let's dive into those really quick.

1631
01:30:43,640 --> 01:30:47,040
Let's do a deep dive into my beast abilities.

1632
01:30:47,040 --> 01:30:52,200
So I would like to use a deep butt dive, my bite,

1633
01:30:52,200 --> 01:30:55,200
and I would like to go and how many people did I knock over with my tail?

1634
01:30:55,200 --> 01:30:57,600
Are you supposed to choose one weapon?

1635
01:30:58,080 --> 01:30:59,600
I think you should just have all of them.

1636
01:30:59,600 --> 01:31:00,600
I agree.

1637
01:31:00,600 --> 01:31:01,600
So I don't really care.

1638
01:31:01,600 --> 01:31:02,600
I agree.

1639
01:31:02,600 --> 01:31:03,600
Keep going.

1640
01:31:03,600 --> 01:31:04,600
Sorry, yeah.

1641
01:31:04,600 --> 01:31:06,600
How many people did I knock down?

1642
01:31:06,600 --> 01:31:07,880
You knocked down like seven.

1643
01:31:07,880 --> 01:31:13,040
Okay, I would like to go and individually bite each and every one of them while they're

1644
01:31:13,040 --> 01:31:14,040
knocked down prone.

1645
01:31:14,040 --> 01:31:15,040
Yeah.

1646
01:31:15,040 --> 01:31:16,040

01:34:20,080 --> 01:34:23,600
So do you even need to shoot me in the catapult? I mean you launch in the air.

You hear the children scream, "Ahh!" and they go blast it away. You can see Hasan the Chapo now

1712
01:34:37,760 --> 01:34:42,560
is getting really worried. This might not be as poggers as I thought it was going to be.

1713
01:34:43,280 --> 01:34:47,480
He now that you were launched him far enough. He can spot him sort of in the

1714
01:34:47,480 --> 01:34:50,080
South don't draw on the table. Sorry.

1715
01:34:50,080 --> 01:34:53,080

01:34:54,380 --> 01:34:56,380
How much how much damage do I take?

1718
01:34:56,380 --> 01:34:58,080

01:35:04,080 --> 01:35:05,080
No, not you now.

1725
01:35:05,080 --> 01:35:08,480
We're back to the top of the order of the workers and so they're gone.

1726
01:35:08,480 --> 01:35:12,680
So these workers are charging now and they're going to try to break in to

1727
01:35:12,680 --> 01:35:15,220
the you probably sorry you were can be

1728
01:35:15,220 --> 01:35:17,720
moved over here talk is now off the map

1729
01:35:17,720 --> 01:35:19,760
and the workers are now trying to break

1730
01:35:19,760 --> 01:35:21,600
down the ice wall but the ice was now in

1731
01:35:21,600 --> 01:35:23,120
the way so they can't break it down

1732
01:35:23,120 --> 01:35:26,400
right away and it's back to the top of

1733
01:35:26,400 --> 01:35:28,040
the order and you guys almost won this I

1734
01:35:28,040 --> 01:35:33,240

1771
01:38:13,280 --> 01:38:17,320

1776
01:38:40,480 --> 01:38:44,800
the crank on the other side, which powers a phonograph and it's playing like the

1777
01:38:44,800 --> 01:38:47,620
playlist that like a gym teacher would play when you're doing like the

1778
01:38:47,620 --> 01:38:48,820
parachute and Jim

1779
01:38:49,720 --> 01:38:54,040
So yeah, one of them slips on the ball and just bangs. You see the

1780
01:38:54,040 --> 01:38:57,880
wipeout logo pop up. It lands on the conveyor belt and just gets

1781
01:38:57,880 --> 01:39:01,640
like suspenders forcibly attached to his back, screaming and

1782
01:39:01,640 --> 01:39:04,520
bloody murder and it is attached to a barrel and put into this

1783
01:39:04,520 --> 01:39:07,880
this hot truck. Also we're doing the pre-wipeout

1784
01:39:07,880 --> 01:39:11,320
interviews too. Yeah. Yeah. Went through what Death Woko had to say.

1785
01:39:11,320 --> 01:39:14,440
Yeah. And he's like, I'm ready to do it. I was just hoping I would get...

1786
01:39:14,440 --> 01:39:18,840
Now here's Jimmy. Jimmy is a 10 year old boy. He lost three of

1787
01:39:18,840 --> 01:39:23,400
his fingers working working suck so this kid doesn't exactly have his head on

1788
01:39:23,400 --> 01:39:29,560
let's see how we did on the call his head gets completely twisted around

1789
01:39:29,560 --> 01:39:34,400
you're doing funny puns about the way they're dying yeah it's so that that

1790
01:39:34,400 --> 01:39:43,640
goes on and then and then as the Sun begins to rise as the last worker has

1791
01:39:43,640 --> 01:39:51,720
fallen, you can hear the echoes of the future, the sounds and sights of Labor Day celebrations.

1792
01:39:51,720 --> 01:39:53,280
You know what those are, right?

1793
01:39:53,280 --> 01:39:57,400
It's such an important holiday that means so much to the average person, that just saying

1794
01:39:57,400 --> 01:40:02,400
Labor Day conjures up so many memories of joy and camaraderie in the world that you

1795
01:40:02,400 --> 01:40:03,400
feel overwhelmed.

1796
01:40:03,400 --> 01:40:06,620
I mean, who doesn't remember their first Labor Day?

1797
01:40:06,620 --> 01:40:08,480
You know, like the first one you could remember.

1798
01:40:08,480 --> 01:40:09,480
I know I do.

1799
01:40:09,480 --> 01:40:13,400
It was the first Monday of September that year, and I remember my parents coming to my room

1800
01:40:13,400 --> 01:40:15,480
and saying, "Get up."

1801
01:40:15,480 --> 01:40:17,080
(laughing)

1802
01:40:17,080 --> 01:40:20,080
And as you stand over the dead bodies of these nobodies,

1803
01:40:20,080 --> 01:40:21,480
the sacrifices you made today

1804
01:40:21,480 --> 01:40:23,240
will reverberate throughout history.

1805
01:40:23,240 --> 01:40:25,360
The projector comes down in your office once again,

1806
01:40:25,360 --> 01:40:27,760
tuxedo man comes back up.

1807
01:40:27,760 --> 01:40:29,940
It's another glorious day here in Duluth, Brooklyn,

1808
01:40:29,940 --> 01:40:32,320
and you, the good worker, should know your rights.

1810
01:40:34,520 --> 01:40:36,600
