Friends happy start now. Do we start the show? I don't know. Why wouldn't we start?

00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:42,840
Okay, and the first thing we're saying is good morning. Not yo, yo Caleb nice outfit

46
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:46,420
You look almost exactly you look this is what you look like every day

47
00:02:46,420 --> 00:02:53,100
You look almost exactly like a very famous celebrity. No, we look exactly the same as you do every day. What's different?

00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:55,100
Won't you take me to oh?

49
00:02:56,080 --> 00:03:00,780
New Christian Dior jacket this oh yeah, yeah, yeah, he's not even wearing the

50
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:06,520
No, look at it. Oh, this is one. Let me check the tag. It's fucking fancy. Oh, that's a that's a replica

51
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:12,820
It's Christian. No, it's real. That's real. It's Dior. I'm on my Christian Dior Santa flow and the beard is - yeah

52
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:19,040
It's Christian. Oh, it's also Christian Dior. Oh my god. Wait. Whoa wearing a beard. That was weird

53
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:22,700
Put do it again do it again. Oh my god

54
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:27,780
I missed my ear on the on the uptake on this. I thought that was your new thing rubbing alcohol

55
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:32,220
I think that I'll probably be dressed pretty much exactly like this for most of December and honestly

56
00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:38,040
I'll probably be taking homeless people's cups and stuff. Yeah, taking their cups. Yeah, I know they have those cups like

57
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:42,300
With it

58
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:48,060
Morocco or Morocco, so they're using that and as we can make a more rocky easy well they did

59
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:51,780
Okay, how could also learned you could make a harmonica out of tissue paper?

60
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:54,580
The thing is what I don't understand about these homeless people with their damn cups

61
00:03:54,580 --> 00:03:56,580
full of money, it's like don't you want to put a lid on that?

62
00:03:56,580 --> 00:03:58,580
If you flip over, your money's going everywhere.

63
00:03:58,580 --> 00:03:59,580
Yep.

64
00:03:59,580 --> 00:04:00,580
Tell you what they should put a lid on.

65
00:04:00,580 --> 00:04:01,580
And there's a guy going around flipping.

66
00:04:01,580 --> 00:04:02,580
And I'm flipping them.

67
00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:06,900
Yeah, I'm flipping them up and I'm like, if you would add a lid on this, your money'd

68
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:07,900
be in your cup.

69
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:10,500
But now it's all over the ground and I'm sucking it up like an anteater.

70
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:11,500
Shaking it all over the place.

71
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:14,300
I think they should just get a piggy bank of themselves.

72
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:17,540
They get, with all the money they make, they should buy a ceramic piggy bank of their face.

73
00:04:17,540 --> 00:04:21,260
A piggy bank would actually be a good idea.

74
00:04:21,260 --> 00:04:23,700
I saw a homeless guy counting money.

75
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:24,700
Rich.

76
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:25,700
Counting the stack.

77
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:27,900
He straight up had a band.

78
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:30,300
Did he have a rack on him?

79
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:31,300
Yeah.

80
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:32,300
Damn.

81
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:33,300
Speaking of this...

82
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:34,300
I saw a homeless lady with a rack on her.

83
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:40,260
When I was walking to the office this morning, speaking of a homeless woman's rack, I saw

84
00:04:40,260 --> 00:04:42,300
a guy's penis on the way to the office this morning.

85
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:43,300
That's the downstairs rack.

86
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:44,300
That's the coat rack.

87
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:45,300
Yeah.

88
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:52,740
I was walking down the block. He was on the at the other end of the block going coming towards me.

89
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:58,780
He stopped and he pulled his pants down and took his penis out and he peed one squirt of pee onto

90
00:04:58,780 --> 00:05:03,420
the ground and pulled his pants back up. That was he a nut? Was he a heavyset guy? No I don't think

91
00:05:03,420 --> 00:05:08,220
so. That was nut. No you don't squirt a little bit of pee. I guarantee it was pee. No that was unhealthy

92
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:12,860
nut. It was watery because he does it so often. He didn't touch his shit. A couple weeks ago,

93
00:05:12,860 --> 00:05:15,860
ago, a couple weeks ago. I was wondering if it was a heavy set guy because a

94
00:05:15,860 --> 00:05:18,800
couple weeks ago I was up early one morning I was going to get like

95
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:25,520
breakfast and I saw just like a big big heavy set homeless man just walking.

96
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:28,860
You can say it. He was a fat homeless man. Yeah why do you say heavy set a million times?

97
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:33,300
Also this guy I don't think he was homeless. I think it was just a guy. Yeah okay.

98
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:38,560
Well I saw a guy scrubbing and rubbing his balls and asshole in the

99
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:40,560
middle of the scrubbing completely different.

100
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:43,560
Peeing on Myrtle Avenue in front of the bank.

101
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:45,560
This guy wasn't a friend of respectful.

102
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:46,260
It's disrespectful.

103
00:05:46,260 --> 00:05:48,160
This what this guy did wasn't sexual.

104
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:50,460
I want to get that he squirted pee because he wanted to show

105
00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:55,260
how strong is his pelvic floor muscles or whatever muscles

106
00:05:55,260 --> 00:05:57,960
control your prostate is that your prostate.

107
00:05:57,960 --> 00:06:02,060
Okay, it also controls the jizz not an expert of jizz or piss.

108
00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:04,860
Okay, if anything I'm not you did this whole story was made

109
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:06,660
up to prove that you knew what muscles.

110
00:06:07,660 --> 00:06:11,820
We knew Caleb hates homeless people, but he loves prostates.

111
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:14,540
I actually fuck with the homeless heavily, and I used to feed them.

112
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:15,540
I do. I do.

113
00:06:15,540 --> 00:06:16,540
I don't do it anymore for church.

114
00:06:16,540 --> 00:06:17,540
Yeah.

115
00:06:17,540 --> 00:06:18,540
I do like their community.

116
00:06:18,540 --> 00:06:21,020
They do have a great ass community.

117
00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:22,660
They make good poetry too.

118
00:06:22,660 --> 00:06:23,660
Yeah.

119
00:06:23,660 --> 00:06:24,660
Yeah.

120
00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:25,660
They're too addicted to drugs for my taste.

121
00:06:25,660 --> 00:06:26,660
A lot of them are funny.

122
00:06:26,660 --> 00:06:27,660
Funny looking.

123
00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:31,100
They say shit like, "Need money for weed."

124
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:32,100
I do.

125
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:33,100
On their side.

126
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:34,100
On their side.

127
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:35,660
They get it tattooed on their side.

128
00:06:35,660 --> 00:06:40,380
I saw a guy in Vegas, I went to Las Vegas, which you can probably tell based on my kind

129
00:06:40,380 --> 00:06:42,100
of aura that I'm bringing in.

130
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:45,660
But I went to Las Vegas and there was a homeless guy that had the funniest fucking sign I've

131
00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:46,860
ever seen, man.

132
00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:51,500
It said, "You need money for strippers and alcohol."

133
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:52,500
What?

134
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:53,820
And I said, "Wait."

135
00:06:53,820 --> 00:06:54,820
Pretty cool.

136
00:06:54,820 --> 00:06:56,380
"What the hell's wrong with you, you fucking idiot?"

137
00:06:56,380 --> 00:06:57,940
And he said, "No, it's just a funny sign.

138
00:06:57,940 --> 00:06:59,660
I'm gonna use this on food and drugs."

139
00:06:59,660 --> 00:07:01,820
And I said, "Okay, well that's fine."

140
00:07:01,820 --> 00:07:04,380
And I gave him a dollar.

141
00:07:04,380 --> 00:07:06,420
Or like villains stole my family.

142
00:07:06,420 --> 00:07:09,020
Villains stole my family is really good.

143
00:07:09,020 --> 00:07:10,220
I've never seen that one.

144

155

My nemesis did this to me.

156

And the nemesis attacked my nemesis in the dark.

157

158
00:07:36,260 --> 00:07:38,260

159

Sinned in past life, reincarnated as this.

160
00:07:40,260 --> 00:07:42,260
Reincarnated as homeless.

161
00:07:42,260 --> 00:07:46,260
And then an arrow and he has flies buzzing around him like pig pen.

162
00:07:46,260 --> 00:07:48,260
Punished by God but keeping my faith.

163
00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:52,260
God is testing me.

164

165
00:07:54,260 --> 00:07:56,260
Do not help me.

Do not help me.

167
00:07:58,260 --> 00:08:00,260
I'm trying to grind harder.

168
00:08:00,260 --> 00:08:02,260
Spit on me.

169
00:08:02,260 --> 00:08:10,220
life more worse. More worse-er. Yeah. Need to go school. Need money for go school. Don't

170
00:08:10,220 --> 00:08:17,160
let me go school. Need be stupid for God. I think it would be pretty fun to be homeless

171
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:23,180
in certain cities. But yeah, I think Vegas is a fun one because if you can, I saw quite

172
00:08:23,180 --> 00:08:28,380
a few homeless people. I don't think it's fun to be houseless anywhere. I wish I could

173
00:08:28,380 --> 00:08:34,200
electrocute you. I would love to be homeless in Las Vegas because you're, you

174
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:38,760
can walk, if you go, because it has everything, you know? You walk around the

00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:27,200
Santa was in Las Vegas.

215
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:28,200
That's very weird.

216
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:29,200
What a funny coincidence.

217
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:33,200
So we actually have our proprietary PalFud Santa tracker.

218
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:34,200
Yep.

00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:35,200
FudTech3000.

- Yeah, Swap Tech 3000.

221
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:38,640
- Think about this, okay.

222
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:39,480
- What?

223
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:40,300
- Santa goes to Las Vegas.

224
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:41,140
- Shut up.

225
00:11:41,140 --> 00:11:41,980
- Santa goes to--

226
00:11:41,980 --> 00:11:42,800
- Whoa.

227
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:44,320
- Play with your--

228
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:46,480
- I don't have anything, I'll play with this, all right.

229
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:47,320
- Santa goes--

230
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:48,920
- Don't open it though, 'cause it's worth a lot of money.

231
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:49,960
- That's collectible.

232
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:53,120
- Santa goes to Las Vegas last week, right?

233
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:53,960
- Yeah.

234
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:54,800
- Caleb, I love you.

235
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:56,360
- Caleb goes--

236
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:57,840
Caleb goes to Las Vegas.

237
00:11:57,840 --> 00:12:01,080
- Yeah, the next week, or the same, I don't remember.

238
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:02,080
- The same day.

239
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:02,920
- The same day, was it the same day?

240
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:04,400
- The same day.

241
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:07,440
will he's in las vegas

242
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:09,120
i think he's a copycat

243
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:11,720
do you think maybe i think working with santa

244
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:14,120
because we don't know the identity of saint

245
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:19,320
that's true we don't may will find out someday but

246
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:24,920
okay can we what it was not what i was going on here and now

247
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:28,440
well you're fucking the dead body of your readers and assert is really on

248
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:32,520
point to that's definitely a kind of a hip-hop santa you know uh... explains

249
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:39,480
It's a dancing, but let's check where Santa is today. Let's check the tracker here. Okay. Well. He's on earth. We know that all right

250
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:46,360
Oh, he's coast okay. Coach. Don't be toast now. What's this? Okay? That's Rikers. I couldn't that's Rikers

251
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:48,680
He's in Rikers Island. Do you think what?

252
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:55,480
Prisoners get coal every year, so it's not delivering no fucking press no I mean oh for a second

253
00:12:55,480 --> 00:13:00,800
I was like okay Santa's in Las Vegas last week Caleb comes back dressed up like Santa, and then it says he's in New York

254
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:04,920
But no, I mean that Santa's clearly oh my god

255
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:11,860
Booked holy shit, and he's 70 and that doesn't even look like okay, so Caleb is not Santa

256
00:13:11,860 --> 00:13:15,680
I will rule that out. We were you thinking I was Santa for a little bit. Yeah, poke my lips out like this

257
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:23,760
Can you put your eye through the beard and see what that might look like

258
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:32,380
This actually that like Cyclops Santa a lot. That's a little scary is what it looks like you look like the movie wizards

259
00:13:32,380 --> 00:13:34,380
You look like

260
00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:38,120
Like you look like freaking Jason Voorhees from Friday the 13th part 2 all right

261
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:43,880
Nerdy for my nerd heads whoa

262
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:48,080
That's the cell they're keeping him in Rikers Island. I don't realize it was so high-tech

263
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:52,200
Wardens name all over

264
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:54,240
Donald Ian Smith, it's holographic

265
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:59,520
Smith you let Santa go you fucking let him crap. How dare you?

266
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:05,800
This guy's a Scrooge. Well. We'll see if we can handle that tomorrow or in the next few days, and maybe Santa will be

267
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:13,080
In Las Vegas Santa Claus yeah, oh hell no okay, well, okay, this was just him and his breath

268
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:19,240
I I still don't know who Santa is someone told me that Santa is real. Yeah, I don't know what you're doing

269
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:23,240
Someone told me it's my mom and my dad, but I've never seen them in the suit.

270
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:24,240
No, Santa is...

271
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:31,160
Listen, pal, we have a whole month of December in front of us, and we are going to investigate.

272
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:34,760
By Christmas Eve, we will know the true identity of Santa, and that's a promise.

273
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:35,760
Okay.

274
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:37,120
That's a Cameron promise.

275
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:38,600
Maybe we'll be slicing them open, too.

276
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:40,320
Okay, are we making that an all three promise?

277
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:41,700
Making that a triple promise.

278
00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:42,700
Triple promise.

279
00:14:42,700 --> 00:14:43,700
Ow, that fucking hurts me.

280
00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:46,160
We will know the true identity of Santa.

281
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:47,440
Well, thank God.

282
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:53,540
Yeah, or thanks Santa. I was in Jesus God son. I was in Las Vegas, and it was very fun

283
00:14:53,540 --> 00:14:59,540
I was there for a place another picture of Caleb with his friends in Las Vegas. Yeah, we had a really good time in Las Vegas

284
00:14:59,540 --> 00:15:05,480
I like your black dress Caleb. Yeah, that's not me. I think you know it so that's you on the left

285
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:11,980
And then those and then who are you with here? I'm with Derek and Judd Derek and Judd

286
00:15:11,980 --> 00:15:17,440
Yeah, that lady who's that Fox in the middle? That's like they're I don't know their shared wife or some

287
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:23,680
Basically, we just all I would love to we basically went out into the strip clubs and tried to fuck a hoe whoa

288
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:28,060
Yeah, we all tried to double team and quadruple team some hoe, but quadruple

289
00:15:28,060 --> 00:15:32,620
Yeah, but she said she'd only do triple teaming and couldn't do a quadruple team not even even credible

290
00:15:32,620 --> 00:15:38,180
No, I'm teams only so I had to get I had to not even be a part of the teams really m3

291
00:15:38,180 --> 00:15:43,060
they triple team some fucking hoe named Rebecca. I do realize I have noticed hoes nowadays,

292
00:15:43,060 --> 00:15:47,140
they're like, "I only want an odd number team. I'll have a one team or a triple team, a single

293
00:15:47,140 --> 00:15:54,660
team. You can single team me, but you can't double team me." Dude, I love going home single

294
00:15:54,660 --> 00:15:58,660
teaming my wife. God, dude. Yeah, man.

295
00:15:58,660 --> 00:16:02,980
Single team. Hoes nowadays, they just want a single team or triple team or quintuple team.

296
00:16:02,980 --> 00:16:03,620
Yeah, I ran a train.

297
00:16:03,620 --> 00:16:06,740
It's like, "I want a quadruple team because me and my three brothers are here."

298
00:16:06,740 --> 00:16:07,140
Yeah.

299
00:16:07,140 --> 00:16:10,100
I ran a train. Me and my five cousins are here. I want to do a six team.

300
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:12,940
I seriously want a triple team. I want six of us to go team you.

301
00:16:12,940 --> 00:16:15,980
I ran a train, yeah, Hyperloop. Yup.

302
00:16:15,980 --> 00:16:18,660
Yeah, just me. Just me and one car.

303
00:16:18,660 --> 00:16:20,980
Yeah, you ran a diaper poop.

304
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:24,540
I'm like, I want to run a train with two cars. She's like, no, one car, three.

305
00:16:24,540 --> 00:16:27,380
Or five, seven, or nine. Or any number that ends in those numbers.

306
00:16:27,380 --> 00:16:29,900
I want to be a human centipede.

307
00:16:29,900 --> 00:16:34,060
Some girls nowadays are so nerdy and slutty, they're only doing prime teams.

308
00:16:34,060 --> 00:16:34,900
That's true.

309
00:16:34,900 --> 00:16:38,340
They want a one team or a nine or a seven.

310
00:16:38,340 --> 00:16:39,460
No, nine is not prime.

311
00:16:39,460 --> 00:16:40,860
I don't remember what the prime numbers are.

312
00:16:40,860 --> 00:16:42,380
That was immediately for nine.

313
00:16:42,380 --> 00:16:43,540
I thought nine was prime.

314
00:16:43,540 --> 00:16:45,700
Three is the next one.

315
00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:46,540
Nine is prime.

316
00:16:46,540 --> 00:16:47,540
Two is not prime.

317
00:16:47,540 --> 00:16:48,900
Two is the special one.

318
00:16:48,900 --> 00:16:50,060
Nope, nine is not prime.

319
00:16:50,060 --> 00:16:51,500
Two is the weird one or something.

320
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:52,340
I don't know, man.

321
00:16:52,340 --> 00:16:53,180
Shut the hell up.

322
00:16:53,180 --> 00:16:54,000
Well, that's what I'm saying.

323
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,140
These hoes are making me do math

324
00:16:55,140 --> 00:16:57,340
to know how much team. What is your prime number?

325
00:16:57,340 --> 00:16:58,180
And it's like, I don't get it.

326
00:16:58,180 --> 00:16:59,380
Yeah, they're trying to make me do math.

327
00:16:59,380 --> 00:17:02,380
Your age plus my age minus seven or whatever.

328
00:17:02,380 --> 00:17:04,460
Man, what the hell is that?

329
00:17:04,460 --> 00:17:11,460
I had this crazy night the other night. I 1.5 teamed this girl with a gnome.

330
00:17:11,460 --> 00:17:25,460
A gnome? Yeah, gnome Chomsky. He's coming dust. And then I 5000 teamed her with an army of gnomes.

331
00:17:25,460 --> 00:17:28,460
You fucked up one girl with an army?

332
00:17:28,460 --> 00:17:28,960
army.

333
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:30,280
Me and

334
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:35,180
baby, how about this? How about you, me and the entire army

335
00:17:35,180 --> 00:17:38,420
and we all fuck you?

336
00:17:38,420 --> 00:17:45,220
You mind if I bring the army? Do you have a friend for my army?

337
00:17:45,220 --> 00:17:52,380
You know, I'd speak. Hey, speaking of Christmas, yeah, stay on this kind of

338
00:17:52,380 --> 00:17:53,780
the sexual tip here.

339
00:17:53,780 --> 00:17:57,460
Mary, she got zero teams.

340
00:17:58,020 --> 00:17:58,860
Damn!

341
00:17:58,860 --> 00:18:00,620
She got zero teams to make Jesus.

342
00:18:00,620 --> 00:18:01,820
She did get zero teams.

343
00:18:01,820 --> 00:18:03,100
And then when it comes to Jesus,

344
00:18:03,100 --> 00:18:05,140
there are zero teams, we're all together.

345
00:18:05,140 --> 00:18:06,020
Damn.

346
00:18:06,020 --> 00:18:06,860
Always one.

347
00:18:06,860 --> 00:18:08,900
You are actually on a fucking fire today.

348
00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:11,260
Zero teamed, zero teamer.

349
00:18:11,260 --> 00:18:12,660
And her name was Mary, right?

350
00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:13,500
Yeah.

351
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:14,740
And she got married.

352
00:18:14,740 --> 00:18:15,900
She was unmarried.

353
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:17,200
Mary unmarried.

354
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:18,140
Mary unmarried.

355
00:18:18,140 --> 00:18:19,700
That's quite contraried.

356
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:22,220
CBS, you gotta jump on that.

357
00:18:22,220 --> 00:18:24,900
CBS, Mary unmarried, that sounds like a perfect show

358
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:25,740
for your comedy lineup.

359
00:18:25,740 --> 00:18:26,780
That is, it does sound like,

360
00:18:26,780 --> 00:18:28,420
Mary Unmarried sounds really good.

361
00:18:28,420 --> 00:18:30,140
They need to do a gritty reboot.

362
00:18:30,140 --> 00:18:32,060
Single and ready for Kris Kringle.

363
00:18:32,060 --> 00:18:32,900
Oh, yeah.

364
00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:33,740
Jesus' birthday.

365
00:18:33,740 --> 00:18:34,860
Hallmark, check that.

366
00:18:34,860 --> 00:18:36,860
Let's pitch some Hallmark movies right now, all right?

367
00:18:36,860 --> 00:18:38,420
I used to love watching Hallmark movies

368
00:18:38,420 --> 00:18:39,260
on my NASDAQ.

369
00:18:39,260 --> 00:18:40,820
What about Mark in the Hall?

370
00:18:40,820 --> 00:18:41,980
Oh, yeah. Mark in the Hall.

371
00:18:41,980 --> 00:18:43,300
He could be a hall monitor.

372
00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:44,940
Dick the Hall.

373
00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:46,420
Dick the Halls.

374
00:18:46,420 --> 00:18:47,260
Monitor.

375
00:18:47,260 --> 00:18:48,180
Dick the Thug.

376
00:18:48,180 --> 00:18:49,940
Dick the Halls with...

377
00:18:49,940 --> 00:18:51,740
They don't do enough Hallmark movies

378
00:18:51,740 --> 00:18:54,460
about a sad gangster who learns of me at Christmas.

379
00:18:54,460 --> 00:18:55,300
That's true.

380
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:57,940
I saw one, but he wasn't even a gangster really.

381
00:18:57,940 --> 00:18:58,940
I have it dude.

382
00:18:58,940 --> 00:18:59,940
Okay.

383
00:18:59,940 --> 00:19:01,660
Dick the halls with Bob and Marley.

384
00:19:01,660 --> 00:19:02,660
Damn.

385
00:19:02,660 --> 00:19:06,020
Weed, weed, weed, weed, weed, weed, weed, weed.

386
00:19:06,020 --> 00:19:07,740
Why would you, why is Bob Marley involved?

387
00:19:07,740 --> 00:19:08,740
Puff, puff, puff, puff, puff, puff, puff, puff.

388
00:19:08,740 --> 00:19:12,020
He wasn't even in S. There's two guys, two characters named Bob and Marley.

389
00:19:12,020 --> 00:19:15,660
Your brain just made a connection because you're a stoner.

390
00:19:15,660 --> 00:19:19,140
I'm a stoner because I thought I heard Bob and Marley.

391
00:19:19,140 --> 00:19:21,140
It's just two guys named Bob and Marley.

392
00:19:21,140 --> 00:19:22,140
What's wrong with me?

393
00:19:22,140 --> 00:19:24,780
You probably see two guys walking down the street and be like, "Whoa, this makes me want

394
00:19:24,780 --> 00:19:31,780
smoke weed. I need to get my head out of the ash tray.

395
00:19:31,780 --> 00:19:32,780
I need to get my head out of the ash tray.

396
00:19:32,780 --> 00:19:33,780
Smoke the bomb with Cheech and Chong.

397
00:19:33,780 --> 00:19:35,780
Their names could be Cheech and Chong.

398
00:19:35,780 --> 00:19:37,780
It could be their full name.

399
00:19:37,780 --> 00:19:42,780
It's Bob Chong and Cheech Marley are the characters in my movie.

400
00:19:42,780 --> 00:19:44,780
It's actually not that far off.

401
00:19:44,780 --> 00:19:47,780
And my movie is not a stoner movie. It's rated G.

402
00:19:47,780 --> 00:19:49,780
G for ganja?

403
00:19:49,780 --> 00:19:51,780
No. G for general audiences.

404
00:19:51,780 --> 00:19:54,120
and it's about, it's a Winnie the Pooh knockoff.

405
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:55,580
- Yeah, the general.

406
00:19:55,580 --> 00:19:57,420
- Yeah, the car insurance.

407
00:19:57,420 --> 00:19:58,720
- You guys are generally crazy.

408
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:00,160
- You're generally...

409
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:02,400
(laughing)

410
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:05,080
- You guys are making me, you guys are crazy in general.

411
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:07,340
- Look at your windscreen.

412
00:20:07,340 --> 00:20:09,100
That shit looks like a muffin.

413
00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:11,140
- You have an insane energy today, Cameron.

414
00:20:11,140 --> 00:20:12,580
You're like Johnny Carson today.

415
00:20:12,580 --> 00:20:14,580
- Flip it on its side, it looks exactly like a pot pie.

416
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:15,780
- You're like just attacking--

417
00:20:15,780 --> 00:20:17,280
- I think something's wrong with my body.

418
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:20,460
- You're like attacking the hoop in a real way.

419
00:20:20,460 --> 00:20:26,780
You're like kind of destroying. You're like really you're gonna ruin it. No, no, I like kind of can't even look at you right now because it's so funny to me.

420
00:20:26,780 --> 00:20:30,780
Want to hear a joke I wrote about a concert I was at? Yeah.

421
00:20:30,780 --> 00:20:34,780
So I was at the Dinosaur Jr. concert the other night with my girlfriend. Okay.

422
00:20:34,780 --> 00:20:42,780
So she goes to the bathroom, right? Ew. Meanwhile, bathroom line for the women's bathroom at that show probably zero long.

423
00:20:42,780 --> 00:20:46,340
Meanwhile, meanwhile, back to me.

424
00:20:46,340 --> 00:20:48,500
But my mic is your popover windscreen.

425
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:51,940
I'm like, she's probably, I'm like, oh, she's lost forever.

426
00:20:51,940 --> 00:20:52,940
She's gone.

427
00:20:52,940 --> 00:20:57,100
She's never, because imagine trying to recognize my ass from behind a Dinosaur Junior concert.

428
00:20:57,100 --> 00:20:58,100
Damn.

429
00:20:58,100 --> 00:20:59,100
True.

430
00:20:59,100 --> 00:21:02,100
Wait, show the back of your head.

431
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:03,100
Who's that?

432
00:21:03,100 --> 00:21:04,540
Is that Cameron or is that?

433
00:21:04,540 --> 00:21:07,060
Oh, is that Jay Maskis himself in the crowd?

434
00:21:07,060 --> 00:21:08,060
Yeah, that's him.

435
00:21:08,060 --> 00:21:09,060
Yeah?

436
00:21:09,060 --> 00:21:10,060
Yeah, that's probably what girls are thinking.

437
00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:14,000
what girls are saying or they think you're Lou Barlow. Someone's name is Jay

438
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:18,700
Mascis? Yeah. He wears an eyeball hat. Uh-huh. It's a Mischka hat. He's still on.

439
00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:23,900
He still wears that Mischka hat. He only wears one Mischka hat? Yeah. He loves that Mischka hat.

440
00:21:23,900 --> 00:21:29,640
Eyeball hat. When I was in Las Vegas, I went to go see the Moscone Cup, the pool

441
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:34,520
championship, and there's this guy. It was awesome. It was so much fun. It's Europe

442
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:39,020
versus the USA. So it's all and it took place in the USA and the USA people are

443
00:21:39,020 --> 00:21:43,460
just going crazy and I'm part of that too so I'm going crazy yeah and there's this

444
00:21:43,460 --> 00:21:51,500
one guy yeah there's one pool player named Billy Thorpe and he used to be on

445
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:56,900
the Moscone Cup but then he got kicked off because he was in a he had a match

446
00:21:56,900 --> 00:22:00,460
against like a Spanish guy and he like missed a ball or something he was like

447
00:22:00,460 --> 00:22:06,380
he starts screaming out of me like you Mexican piece of shit so he was there

448
00:22:06,380 --> 00:22:10,860
He's banned from playing yeah, but he came and he got like 15 different seats around the arena

449
00:22:10,860 --> 00:22:14,560
So he could just run around he wore no shirt American flag overalls

450
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:17,820
$100 bills into the fucking

451
00:22:17,820 --> 00:22:24,700
Did he was a man that's it was a when you talk I can only look at your mouth. It's frame

454
00:22:33,820 --> 00:22:35,820
Why have you seen this video? I haven't seen that one.

455
00:22:35,820 --> 00:22:37,820
Do you guys think I...

456
00:22:37,820 --> 00:22:39,820
Am I doing a plump lip challenge?

457
00:22:39,820 --> 00:22:41,820
That's what you look like right now.

458
00:22:41,820 --> 00:22:43,820
You guys are learning right now.

459
00:22:43,820 --> 00:22:45,820
Glory, glory, hallelujah hole.

460
00:22:45,820 --> 00:22:47,820
Merry Christmas.

461
00:22:47,820 --> 00:22:49,820
Yep, that's just flags.

462
00:22:49,820 --> 00:22:51,820
Why have we got the German flag today?

463
00:22:51,820 --> 00:22:53,820
What?

464
00:22:53,820 --> 00:22:55,820
This looks like a German flag?

465
00:22:55,820 --> 00:22:57,820
Yeah, the black, yellow, and red.

466
00:22:57,820 --> 00:22:59,820
Yeah, you're right.

467
00:22:59,820 --> 00:23:01,660
And I have red and white on.

468
00:23:01,660 --> 00:23:02,620
Oh, and I'm yellow.

00:23:02,620 --> 00:23:03,120
You're Polish, dude.

00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:03,620
And black.

471
00:23:03,620 --> 00:23:04,620

You are the Wiz Khalifa of our entire crew.

475
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:12,620
[sniffs]

476
00:23:12,620 --> 00:23:14,120
Is that the Belgium flag?

477
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:15,120
Yeah, it is.

478
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:18,620

I've seen you take a Wiz. Your shirt's the color of Wiz.

484
00:23:23,820 --> 00:23:24,820
You never saw me take a Wiz.

485
00:23:24,820 --> 00:23:26,120
I've seen you take a Wiz.

486
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:26,620
When?

487
00:23:26,620 --> 00:23:27,820
You don't fucking know my life.

488
00:23:27,820 --> 00:23:28,320
When?

489
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:32,060

501
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:26,440
- Yeah.

502
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:28,260
- And it's like they're stalls, but they're like full rooms.

503
00:24:28,260 --> 00:24:29,100
Well, that's what I was saying.

504
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:31,860
Wouldn't it be great to be able to have one spot

505
00:24:31,860 --> 00:24:33,620
where you can put your hand on the wall

506
00:24:33,620 --> 00:24:34,980
and you know the person on the other side

507
00:24:34,980 --> 00:24:36,640
is putting their hand on the same place

508
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:37,820
on the other side of the wall.

509
00:24:37,820 --> 00:24:38,660
- Oh my God.

510
00:24:38,660 --> 00:24:40,660
- And you can feel their energy through the wall.

511
00:24:40,660 --> 00:24:42,260
- That's like a glory hole for like kids.

512
00:24:42,260 --> 00:24:43,660
- For, no.

513
00:24:43,660 --> 00:24:46,260
- You want to make that?

514
00:24:46,260 --> 00:24:48,100
- That's a glory hole for kids.

515
00:24:48,100 --> 00:24:50,560
- No, it's like a kid-friendly glory hole is what I mean.

516
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:51,400
Like you could do that.

517
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:52,660
- Why do you want a kid-friendly glory hole?

518
00:24:52,660 --> 00:24:54,020
- I don't want that.

519
00:24:54,020 --> 00:24:57,300
I'm just saying it's like a PG version.

520
00:24:57,300 --> 00:25:00,260
- Well, why would you want to be touching hands with a kid?

521
00:25:00,260 --> 00:25:02,540
- I'm not saying, I'm saying that even a kid could do that.

522
00:25:02,540 --> 00:25:03,380
I'm not saying that,

523
00:25:03,380 --> 00:25:04,340
(laughing)

524
00:25:04,340 --> 00:25:07,340
I'm not saying it would be built for kids.

525
00:25:07,340 --> 00:25:09,460
I'm just saying like anybody could do that.

526
00:25:09,460 --> 00:25:11,380
- He's just digging himself deeper and deeper.

527
00:25:11,380 --> 00:25:12,220
- With you?

528
00:25:12,220 --> 00:25:13,760
- No, with whoever, man.

529
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:16,700
I'm taking this stand out a bit.

530
00:25:16,700 --> 00:25:17,660
- With a man?

531
00:25:17,660 --> 00:25:19,180
- With a man or a woman?

532
00:25:19,180 --> 00:25:20,020
- With any man.

533
00:25:20,020 --> 00:25:22,180
- It's not gay if you hold hands with another man while peeing.

534
00:25:22,180 --> 00:25:23,300
- It's not holding hands though.

535
00:25:24,300 --> 00:25:29,700
It's not like it's not a data transfer energy to another man like eating if I

536
00:25:29,700 --> 00:25:33,580
Like if you put your hand on the other side of this we can feel each other

537
00:25:33,580 --> 00:25:37,780
This is maybe a little too thick and maybe there's too much Ruth. Yeah

538
00:25:37,780 --> 00:25:44,140
There wouldn't be a roof in my bathroom situation. I don't think I mean like it doesn't it's not about like if I put my hand

539
00:25:44,140 --> 00:25:48,500
Under the table right here you can feel me as my cock and balls

540
00:25:48,500 --> 00:25:50,740
Yeah, and you can feel me through the foliage is touching them

541
00:25:50,740 --> 00:25:55,820
You just use you just can be touched as much as you're usable. We'll just use your consumable to me

542
00:25:55,820 --> 00:25:59,860
Yeah, you're basically just an object. You're a potion or elixir no doubt

543
00:25:59,860 --> 00:26:05,020
I would love to spray you on stuff you want you want to spray me like a health potion. Yeah, yeah

544
00:26:05,020 --> 00:26:10,860
If I could just yeah, I could just go like this and I could go like that and you'd spray something

545
00:26:10,860 --> 00:26:13,580
Oh, this is a good idea though like any kind of non-sexual

546
00:26:13,580 --> 00:26:18,700
Like way to see my own sexual way to communicate in the bathroom in the bathroom with the people who are next to you

547
00:26:18,700 --> 00:26:20,700
- That's a great idea. - A can and a string.

548
00:26:20,700 --> 00:26:22,700
- I'm not a sexual...

549
00:26:22,700 --> 00:26:24,700
- (laughter)

550
00:26:24,700 --> 00:26:26,700
- Yeah, buddy, it's called your phone.

551
00:26:26,700 --> 00:26:30,700
- My childhood house, they had this thing on the doorbell.

552
00:26:30,700 --> 00:26:32,700
- He wants a child house,

553
00:26:32,700 --> 00:26:34,700
where he can put this glory hole in.

554
00:26:34,700 --> 00:26:36,700
- He does, though.

555
00:26:36,700 --> 00:26:38,700
- He does want that. - Who's he? Me?

556
00:26:38,700 --> 00:26:40,700
- I take that fist bump back! I don't want that!

557
00:26:40,700 --> 00:26:42,700
- You fist bumped it. - Oh my God, a hole that's

558
00:26:42,700 --> 00:26:44,700
fish-shaped so you can't put your penis through it,

559
00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:46,700
so you can only fist bump when you take a crap or piss.

560
00:26:46,700 --> 00:26:50,060
pissed. You could put your penis through there. How big is your fucking cock? It's fist hole

561
00:26:50,060 --> 00:26:54,260
shapes. No, it's about the shape. It's not about the size. It's square versus circle.

562
00:26:54,260 --> 00:27:01,260
The physicists will make it work. You have a social penis? Closer to social air then.

563
00:27:01,260 --> 00:27:08,380
It has to meet like... There's a switch, right? Or it could have glass shards pointing so

564
00:27:08,380 --> 00:27:13,860
you can't... It should just scan your penis to see if it's a penis or an ellipse. Above

565
00:27:13,860 --> 00:27:17,820
the doorbell there was a hole and there's a tube that goes all the way up to the

566
00:27:17,820 --> 00:27:21,260
second floor and you can talk into it and the person upstairs puts their ear to

567
00:27:21,260 --> 00:27:24,420
it yeah and you can and you go like hey it's me so something like that in the

568
00:27:24,420 --> 00:27:30,420
bathroom but it if it's a row of stall these room stalls and there's a row of

569
00:27:30,420 --> 00:27:34,620
holes on the wall and you can talk to any they're all labeled with numbers so

570
00:27:34,620 --> 00:27:38,540
it's like it's like I know my friend went into five I mean I don't know how

571
00:27:38,540 --> 00:27:43,620
is it going yeah but holes is like okay tin cans people could cut the string and

572
00:27:43,620 --> 00:27:50,580
steal the can. That's a good point. Homeless people would be putting money in those things.

573
00:27:50,580 --> 00:27:54,600
I never understood this about glory holes. When you go into a glory hole, the whole thing

574
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:59,180
is like, "Oh yeah, I went to a glory hole, but I thought it was a woman sucking my penis

575
00:27:59,180 --> 00:28:03,100
and it was a guy, it turns out." Aren't you in the guy's bathroom? You're in the men's

576
00:28:03,100 --> 00:28:06,540
bathroom. What the hell are you doing? Go into the woman's bathroom and start taking

577
00:28:06,540 --> 00:28:10,260
shits if you really want to get your dick sucked by a girl so bad. You know what you're

578
00:28:10,260 --> 00:28:14,580
Going into the men's bathroom speaking of this all your life. So here we go

579
00:28:14,580 --> 00:28:16,980
Maybe now okay a new bathroom idea

580
00:28:16,980 --> 00:28:23,360
Maybe it's maybe it's the girls stalls on one side and boys stalls on the other and the communication holes are through the walls

581
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:24,420
but so it's like

582
00:28:24,420 --> 00:28:25,900
There's one a and one B

583
00:28:25,900 --> 00:28:32,240
And it's like a 1a through 10 a and 1b to through 10 be all a is boy all B's girl

584
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:34,740
He's as red as his suit right now. I think we should hear about

585
00:28:34,740 --> 00:28:41,740
about which your about

586
00:28:41,740 --> 00:28:53,040
you probably will tell for the first

587
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:55,500
funny things it goes anywhere okay

588
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:58,620
oh yeah only there's that's definitely some

589
00:28:58,620 --> 00:29:01,780
like a brown turn up kinda fetish

590
00:29:01,780 --> 00:29:05,740
that somebody's like i would have to move out of a glory hole

591
00:29:05,740 --> 00:29:09,280
what would you do if you were if you were you're into it

592
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:13,260
you into a bathroom as a glory hole and so on the other side of you do not pull

593
00:29:13,260 --> 00:29:17,580
up guiding we had don't do that it's not not only i would pull up guy eating

594
00:29:17,580 --> 00:29:18,940
food is a good

595
00:29:18,940 --> 00:29:21,780
hot girl

596
00:29:21,780 --> 00:29:25,100
which so which ended good with the

597
00:29:25,100 --> 00:29:29,100
and then a gold guy shits in her...

598
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:30,100
A gold guy?

599
00:29:30,100 --> 00:29:31,100
A golden guy?

600
00:29:31,100 --> 00:29:32,100
A golden guy walks up?

601
00:29:32,100 --> 00:29:33,100
A golden guy!

602
00:29:33,100 --> 00:29:34,100
A golden...

603
00:29:34,100 --> 00:29:35,100
Oscar?

604
00:29:35,100 --> 00:29:36,100
I don't know.

605
00:29:36,100 --> 00:29:37,100
Oscar walks up, shits...

606
00:29:37,100 --> 00:29:42,100
I don't know what color he is, but he shits in her big lips.

607
00:29:42,100 --> 00:29:43,100
And she's blonde.

608
00:29:43,100 --> 00:29:44,100
Blonde.

609
00:29:44,100 --> 00:29:48,100
You know there's like a fetish where people like, they want to paint themselves metallic.

610
00:29:48,100 --> 00:29:50,100
This is the guy who does it.

611
00:29:50,100 --> 00:29:51,100
Yeah.

612
00:29:51,100 --> 00:29:52,100
So somebody like this...

613
00:29:52,100 --> 00:29:53,100
Yeah.

614
00:29:53,100 --> 00:29:57,680
Yeah, but he doesn't he doesn't gold. That's a common misconception. He

615
00:29:57,680 --> 00:30:02,320
poops. He poops. Green brown and very, very green. Speaking of speaking of

616
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:03,400
Caleb's thing,

617
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:05,760
we have a list today.

618
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:09,160
Oh, do we? We do have a list. It's a list I found.

619
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:11,000
It's just a it's a

620
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:15,120
here. Hit me the

621
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:18,480
jolly today. Well, it's

622
00:30:20,120 --> 00:30:24,920
I smoked weed five days ago, and I just my head is for real is from bad girls Bible

623
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:27,600
It's the complete list of

624
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:29,880
239 yes, sir

625
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:33,120
Uh-huh is it can a complete?

626
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:35,400
239

627
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:41,240
Sexual fetishes and kinks list are we doing all 239 today. We're not doing all 239

628
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:43,600
I think we'll just go through the the best of yeah

629
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:47,320
Why do I'm gonna come up with more right now can I can I could have a prediction yes?

630
00:30:47,320 --> 00:30:51,000
Yes. If this is a new one and no one's done it yet, I get a reward.

631
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,000
Okay. Finger play.

632
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,000
(laughter)

633
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,000
Buddy.

634
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,000
If finger play's not on here, I get a reward.

635
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,000
Does it look like I have a really small head?

636
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,000
No. Damn it.

637
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,000
No, it doesn't. Sorry, man.

638
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,000
Sorry, yeah. That's a bummer.

639
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,000
(laughter)

640
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,000
(laughter)

641
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,000
(laughter)

642
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,000
I'm ready. I'm having way too much fun at this.

643
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:20,160
much fun. Click on the other screen so it doesn't get fucked up. So this is the list.

644
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:24,400
It's like, oh there's also a discreet newsletter, but we talked previously

645
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:28,640
about the definition of kinky and what makes a fetish. Now it's time to list all

646
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:32,400
of those in one place. It's unlikely that you've heard every fetish on this list,

647
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:39,000
on this list of kinks. We'd be willing you have or have at least

648
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:42,880
thought about a few of them. Some of them were fairly common after all. All right,

649
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:47,800
So maybe what we're doing here. We should just go through these and say whether or not we have this that's what I was thinking

650
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:49,800
Yeah, okay, so so this first one is a

651
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:58,140
So a base of ilia, which is the attraction to people in neck braces wheelchairs cast or other devices that impair mobility?

652
00:31:58,140 --> 00:32:02,360
That was documented for the first time occurring in a woman in the late 80s

653
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:07,600
It may be a part of a medical fetish enjoyed because it restricts so I know that we've talked that we've done this exact

654
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:13,040
joke about other fetishes before, but imagine being born in the year 100 and

655
00:32:13,040 --> 00:32:15,200
being a really attractive people in wheelchairs.

656
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:17,200
Yes, that's tough.

657
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:18,200
Well, that's what maybe...

658
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:20,200
It's a chicken or the egg thing because I feel like you haven't seen...

659
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:22,200
Well, it came from Flintstone cars.

660
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:23,200
Oh.

661
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:24,700
That's the first wheelchair.

662
00:32:24,700 --> 00:32:27,200
But that's probably what has driven most invention in the world.

663
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:28,200
Yeah.

664
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:31,200
It's probably Thomas Edison was addicted to electricity and like electrocuting women.

665
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:32,200
Yeah.

666
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:34,200
And he was like, I'm going to put that in a bulb.

667
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:35,200
Yeah, I want a bulb of that.

668
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:36,200
I want a bulb that I can...

669
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:39,000
I want a bulb that lets me see me do this.

670
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,000
Yes.

671
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:43,840
What if I could take the byproduct of my fetish and make the room brighter with it?

672
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:44,840
Good idea.

673
00:32:44,840 --> 00:32:45,840
Or play music.

674
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:47,520
He just said, "I want a bulb of that."

675
00:32:47,520 --> 00:32:49,400
I just want a bulb.

676
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:50,400
Bulb it.

677
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:51,400
Bulb that.

678
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:52,400
Bulb that.

679
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:53,400
Bulb it up.

680
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:54,400
Just put that in a bulb.

681
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:55,400
What's a bulb?

682
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:56,400
I don't know yet.

683
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:57,400
I think I will be finding out.

684
00:32:57,400 --> 00:32:58,400
Bulb it.

685
00:32:58,400 --> 00:32:59,400
You know, a bulb.

686
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:00,400
Yeah, because they had bulbs before light bulbs.

687
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:02,000
They had onion, well bulbs are plants before that.

688
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:03,680
Yeah, they had onions before light bulbs.

689
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:04,680
They definitely did.

690
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:05,680
They had onions.

691
00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:07,720
I say the onion is the mother of invention.

692
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:08,840
Yeah.

693
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:10,800
And this next one here.

694
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:12,520
Oh, this is a quick quiz.

695
00:33:12,520 --> 00:33:14,080
I mean, no. Click on that.

696
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:15,840
Click on that photo. I think it'll bring us to a

697
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:16,840
list.

698
00:33:16,840 --> 00:33:19,500
Yeah. Or it brings us to this quiz here.

699
00:33:19,500 --> 00:33:21,040
And I figured, oh, great.

700
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:23,680
Has a guy ever complimented you two on your

701
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:24,680
pro job skills?

702
00:33:24,680 --> 00:33:25,760
For me? Yeah.

703
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:27,280
I would say.

704
00:33:27,280 --> 00:33:28,080
Rarely, right?

705
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:29,800
Rarely. I'm not so good.

706
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:30,840
Yeah. OK.

707
00:33:30,840 --> 00:33:32,960
Can you deep throat without gagging?

708
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,400
I know the trick is you have to hold your thumb.

709
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:37,400
Okay.

710
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:38,400
Do we have a prop?

711
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:39,400
No?

712
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:44,880
So you go fast like that.

713
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:46,960
You're kind of an in and out sucker.

714
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:47,960
Yeah.

715
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:50,880
Oh man, is that what girls do to girls' penises?

716
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:51,880
Is that what they do?

717
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:52,880
Is they touch their back thing?

718
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:54,120
I didn't even think about that.

719
00:33:54,120 --> 00:33:55,120
That's horrible.

720
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:56,120
How do they not vomit?

721
00:33:56,120 --> 00:33:57,120
I don't know if people do that.

722
00:33:57,120 --> 00:33:58,120
I don't know.

723
00:33:58,120 --> 00:34:00,360
(laughter)

724
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:06,440
- I don't know if it beats me, man.

725
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:08,760
- Women are magic.

726
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:15,000
- How do you do that so well?

727
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:16,160
- Oh, my finger is a thing.

728
00:34:16,160 --> 00:34:17,200
- I can do it with my toothbrush.

729
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:18,520
- That tasted like pepperoni.

730
00:34:18,520 --> 00:34:19,560
- I can do it with my toothbrush really well.

731
00:34:19,560 --> 00:34:20,400
- I didn't even eat any pepperoni.

732
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:21,240
- I could do my pinky.

733
00:34:21,240 --> 00:34:22,280
- I did not eat pepperoni today.

734
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:23,960
- So if your penis looks like,

735
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:27,920
is this dimensions, I could deep throat you.

736
00:34:27,920 --> 00:34:29,920
throw a hand he's losing it.

737
00:34:29,920 --> 00:34:31,920
(laughter)

738
00:34:31,920 --> 00:34:33,920
Well you do your fingers like this.

739
00:34:33,920 --> 00:34:35,920
Hey, you know what? I guess no I gag every time.

740
00:34:35,920 --> 00:34:37,920
This one goes out to girls.

741
00:34:37,920 --> 00:34:39,920
This episode goes out to girls.

742
00:34:39,920 --> 00:34:41,920
Dedicated to every girl in the world.

743
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:43,920
That is fucking impressive.

744
00:34:43,920 --> 00:34:45,920
Do you regularly make eye contact when giving him oral sex?

745
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:47,920
Um, sometimes but I make it really awkward.

746
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:49,920
I'm too shy personally.

747
00:34:49,920 --> 00:34:51,920
I make it awkward as hell.

748
00:34:51,920 --> 00:34:53,920
If I was a girl, I'm thinking about it more.

749
00:34:53,920 --> 00:34:55,920
Do you use both of your hands?

750
00:34:55,920 --> 00:35:01,080
entire time. Doesn't it make you use both your hands, the guys that have a fucking monstrously

751
00:35:01,080 --> 00:35:05,040
huge cock. No, or you can just be on the tip and your hands can be like on either side

752
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:08,760
like this. Playing it like a freak. T-Rex. True. Alright, if you overlap it like a golf

753
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:12,960
club. Do you swallow? No. Sometimes but I hate it. Never, I never swallow. Wait, why

754
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:18,400
is always not an option? Have you ever struggled to make a guy orgasm during a blowjob? Yes.

755
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:23,280
Yeah. It may have happened. It's happened many times. But I made him come using a different

756
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:25,280
Yes, I do a facial every time.

757
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:27,280
I don't usually do a facial.

758
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:29,280
I always end it with a facial.

759
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:31,280
I usually

760
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:33,280
I usually crouch down

761
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:35,280
like I'm going to do a facial and I dodge out of the way

762
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:37,280
at the last second.

763
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:39,280
How confident are you when giving oral sex to a guy?

764
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:41,280
I'm quite confident.

765
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:43,280
I guess that's a good point.

766
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:45,280
Wait, let me change my answer.

767
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:47,280
I feel like a blowjob queen.

768
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:49,280
You're steamrolling this here.

769
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:51,280
Let's relax for a second.

770
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:55,280
a great idea for women out there. Yeah. Because I'm trying to make it easier now because now

771
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:59,760
I learned the horrors of oral sex. Yeah. Is that you can make them think they're going

772
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:02,760
to come on your face and just dodge it. Just dodge, yeah. They're not going to care once

773
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:04,560
they've already fucking done it. Exactly, because they, yeah. Or even better. Now you

774
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:08,560
can only get with that once probably. But after that, you know, you can watch me once.

775
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:12,360
I matrix dodge it. I go backwards. Yeah. If you go, or if you just say like, I promise

776
00:36:12,360 --> 00:36:15,200
I'm not going to dodge it this time. I'm not going to dodge it. Whoa, I tripped. Yeah. It

777
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:17,200
goes all over a picture of his family.

778
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:18,600
What?

779
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:19,700
No!

780
00:36:19,700 --> 00:36:20,300
Oh, God.

781
00:36:20,300 --> 00:36:21,600
That's my glass photo of my grandma.

782
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:22,800
You hit our pet bird.

783
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:23,300
Great.

784
00:36:23,300 --> 00:36:25,600
It missed and went all in my hands.

785
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:26,100
Come shot.

786
00:36:26,100 --> 00:36:27,700
Missed and went all in my hands.

787
00:36:27,700 --> 00:36:29,200
I'm sticking it up me making a baby out of it.

788
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:33,200
Every time I come, my parrot knows that every time I jizz, I say, "Come shot."

789
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:35,400
Come shot.

790
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:36,200
I'm like, "Come shot!"

791
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:36,900
Come shot!

792
00:36:36,900 --> 00:36:37,900
Yeah, come shot.

793
00:36:37,900 --> 00:36:39,600
That's nasty.

794
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:40,100
Yeah.

795
00:36:40,100 --> 00:36:40,600
Yeah.

796
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:41,400
Yeah.

797
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:43,200
I used to say Kobe, but...

798
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:44,200
Then he died.

799
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:47,060
And then I said with a thing that the closest thing that

800
00:36:47,060 --> 00:36:51,240
Why would you say Kobe is a sexual assaulter? I know it's why I stopped when I learned that

801
00:36:51,240 --> 00:36:56,940
Have you ever initiated a blowjob when he wasn't expecting it and caught him by every time I surprise him

802
00:36:56,940 --> 00:36:59,460
I've never given an expected

803
00:36:59,460 --> 00:37:06,000
Full of surprises I jump out of places. Yeah. Yeah, it's not like we're sitting together, and I suddenly do I sneak up

804
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:10,620
I'm under the bed. I'm under there for six hours. I grab his ankles. I pull him under the bed

805
00:37:11,220 --> 00:37:18,460
And I start sucking him from the back so he can't see me dear regularly. Yeah for sure regularly. Yeah, whoa

806
00:37:18,460 --> 00:37:23,500
That's not possible no

807
00:37:23,500 --> 00:37:26,340
That's straight

808
00:37:26,340 --> 00:37:30,420
Is yodeling you put yodeling he's loud

809
00:37:30,420 --> 00:37:36,380
Are you happy with your current blowjob? No? I'm not mostly unhappy. Oh, yeah

810
00:37:38,860 --> 00:37:41,120
Wait, how it's a low job using your score

811
00:37:41,120 --> 00:37:45,720
I've put together a special report on the five dangerous mistakes that will destroy your sex law

812
00:37:45,720 --> 00:37:52,400
I shouldn't have taken so we should receive this report we can get this in our email all right. Let's get it. Let's get it

813
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:55,500
Wait, why'd you switch to that camera switch back to that camera?

814
00:37:55,500 --> 00:37:59,560
And

815
00:37:59,560 --> 00:38:03,660
I'm excited to see what these all say but first let's get back to the list maybe yeah

816
00:38:03,660 --> 00:38:05,660
Let's get let's get back to this see that later

817
00:38:05,660 --> 00:38:07,800
Okay

818
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:13,440
Auto plus bow, but you can't read no I should have worn my glasses guys

819
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:20,280
Plus a feeling it's a type of flush of feelia where a person is aroused by the idea of being a stuffed animal

820
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:28,500
Especially a cartoonish one being a stuffed animal being an animal which I feel like there's a distinction between this and a furry

821
00:38:28,500 --> 00:38:31,100
There's also there's a there's a distinction for me

822
00:38:31,100 --> 00:38:33,100
I have this but I

823
00:38:33,100 --> 00:38:38,460
specifically for being a webkinz because I really like the idea of having a code that I can be used to play games online with

824
00:38:38,460 --> 00:38:43,820
Yeah, I would love to have a little avatar of myself that goes mining for gold coins

825
00:38:43,820 --> 00:38:47,300
Yeah, like a firefighter chair imagine if the guy in the

826
00:38:47,300 --> 00:38:49,860
Fucked me in the game

827
00:38:49,860 --> 00:38:51,980
What oh the guy?

828
00:38:51,980 --> 00:38:57,820
Fucked in the in the game. I fucked me like so I'm getting fucked as a webkinz. I'm the leopard

829
00:38:57,820 --> 00:39:01,780
Okay, I'm getting fucked in my butt. I'm uploaded

830
00:39:02,380 --> 00:39:07,740
Meanwhile, the guy in the curio shop, he's got me in the cave.

831
00:39:07,740 --> 00:39:08,900
He's got me on all fours.

832
00:39:08,900 --> 00:39:09,400
I'm going--

833
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:10,700
[IMITATING MACHINE GUN]

834
00:39:10,700 --> 00:39:11,780
--in the computer.

835
00:39:11,780 --> 00:39:13,620
I'm getting two at once.

836
00:39:13,620 --> 00:39:14,420
Oh.

837
00:39:14,420 --> 00:39:16,700
I'm getting double teamed virtually.

838
00:39:16,700 --> 00:39:17,380
That's crazy.

839
00:39:17,380 --> 00:39:18,940
I'm back thinking about teaming.

840
00:39:18,940 --> 00:39:22,460
If I was the real Santa, you would be off the list.

841
00:39:22,460 --> 00:39:23,020
I'd be off.

842
00:39:23,020 --> 00:39:24,220
Yeah, I'd be getting you off.

843
00:39:24,220 --> 00:39:25,980
There would be no naughty or nice for you.

844
00:39:25,980 --> 00:39:27,700
No, no, no.

845
00:39:27,700 --> 00:39:28,500
No, no, no.

846
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:29,700
You wouldn't even be on the--

847
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:30,540
Striking me from the records?

848
00:39:30,540 --> 00:39:31,980
You might as well be fucking dead.

849
00:39:31,980 --> 00:39:36,020
if I expunging me just redacted you don't exist. Your social security numbers

850
00:39:36,020 --> 00:39:36,440
gone

851
00:39:36,440 --> 00:39:40,380
because you know Santa controls that of course. How do you think he keeps

852
00:39:40,380 --> 00:39:43,180
trying all the kids exactly the kids have to say everyone's name Mohammed

853
00:39:43,180 --> 00:39:47,980
yeah all that's gonna be hard plus I could be at work. My webkins is getting

854
00:39:47,980 --> 00:39:53,100
railed. Do you feel it? You have a toy. I come home and I have a USB that I

855
00:39:53,100 --> 00:39:55,620
unplug. I put in the back of my head like the matrix and I got like

856
00:39:55,620 --> 00:40:00,020
all comes in at once every time I got real during the day while I was at

857
00:40:00,020 --> 00:40:04,260
I think that in a couple years probably will just so every everybody stuff up

858
00:40:04,260 --> 00:40:08,980
Yeah, just have it USB USB C port USB C port would be standardized. Yeah

859
00:40:08,980 --> 00:40:13,340
MacBook charger

860
00:40:13,340 --> 00:40:15,100
Yeah, it's like I don't need to buy a toy

861
00:40:15,100 --> 00:40:18,480
Well that would make this one a lot of people with this fetish very upset

862
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:24,420
You can already fuck yourself after breaking it and having to buy a new one bathroom bathroom control where the dominant person controls

863
00:40:24,420 --> 00:40:30,260
when and how and where the person, the submissive can urinate or defecate.

864
00:40:30,260 --> 00:40:38,980
Do you see how useful my bathroom communication idea would be for people with fetishes?

865
00:40:38,980 --> 00:40:41,980
Poop now, don't poop now.

866
00:40:41,980 --> 00:40:42,980
All the stalls controlled.

867
00:40:42,980 --> 00:40:45,660
Here's my problem with this.

868
00:40:45,660 --> 00:40:48,980
This entry says extreme bathroom control can be dangerous.

869
00:40:48,980 --> 00:40:51,580
Extreme anything can be pretty dangerous.

870
00:40:51,580 --> 00:40:53,500
That's the meaning of extreme.

871
00:40:53,500 --> 00:40:57,940
get into the extreme spiciness from Mexican food that's way too yeah

872
00:40:57,940 --> 00:41:02,020
extreme sour cream that can be dangerous

873
00:41:02,020 --> 00:41:07,300
extremely old I'm not extremely sour I don't invent this shit I just Oh

874
00:41:07,300 --> 00:41:12,460
extreme Islam and other religions can be very dangerous

875
00:41:12,460 --> 00:41:16,700
don't talk about people don't talk about extremist political philosophy

876
00:41:16,700 --> 00:41:23,220
political philosophy that shit's bad extreme danger yeah extreme danger can be

877
00:41:23,220 --> 00:41:27,660
harmful. Here's an article that was on the side though. Check out "How to make a man

878
00:41:27,660 --> 00:41:33,940
cry in bed." Sadness. Which I didn't look through because I think I would start crying

879
00:41:33,940 --> 00:41:38,300
even thinking about it. That's true. Maybe the first five minutes of "up" while you're

880
00:41:38,300 --> 00:41:43,300
getting fucked. For me it's like the next 90 minutes I'm like I missed the best first

881
00:41:43,300 --> 00:41:50,300
part when my wife died. I wish the wife was still alive. He gets rid of that old bag and

882
00:41:50,300 --> 00:41:51,700
does lie around the world.

883
00:41:51,700 --> 00:41:56,000
Yeah, she does look bad AF when she's running the balloon stand.

884
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:57,200
We mean at the very beginning?

885
00:41:57,200 --> 00:41:57,700
Yeah.

886
00:41:57,700 --> 00:41:58,500
When she's a child?

887
00:41:58,500 --> 00:42:00,800
No, when she's running and when they're he's working in the zoo.

888
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:04,300
Oh, yeah, you you see up here like I don't want her to grow up.

889
00:42:04,300 --> 00:42:04,700
Yeah.

890
00:42:04,700 --> 00:42:05,800
Yeah, he says that's it.

891
00:42:05,800 --> 00:42:06,700
He sees that many balloons.

892
00:42:06,700 --> 00:42:09,000
He's like, I hope that's not the age of her at a birthday party.

893
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:10,800
I wish it would be a one balloon at a birthday party.

894
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:11,800
This is next to you.

895
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:12,100
What's going on?

896
00:42:12,100 --> 00:42:15,800
These next two I think are like kind of closely related.

897
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:19,500
Chasmophilia aroused by crevices, caverns, or valleys.

898
00:42:19,500 --> 00:42:20,000
Okay.

899
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:23,400
And then claustrophilia is the opposite of claustrophobia.

900
00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:24,960
That's when you're attracted to Santa Claus.

901
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:26,000
Yeah.

902
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:27,360
What up?

903
00:42:27,360 --> 00:42:31,720
It's a person who becomes aroused by

904
00:42:31,720 --> 00:42:34,240
orgasm through confinement.

905
00:42:34,240 --> 00:42:37,000
Meme this. You must be Santa Claus if you think we're fucking.

906
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:38,760
And I'm like this.

907
00:42:38,760 --> 00:42:39,760
And then meme this.

908
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:42,600
OK, this is pretty good.

909
00:42:42,600 --> 00:42:46,200
You must be Santa Claus if you think I'm fucking you from behind.

910
00:42:46,200 --> 00:42:48,000
And then I maybe come in like.

911
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:49,520
Yeah. And you're like on all fours.

912
00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:50,520
for

913
00:42:50,520 --> 00:42:57,160
yeah up your backside up and your front side down go on the table because this

914
00:42:57,160 --> 00:43:00,880

00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:04,960

916
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:06,280

00:43:17,480 --> 00:43:19,480
Santa Claus this year.

920
00:43:19,480 --> 00:43:30,000
So we could mean that yeah, you could totally impact font give a font and everything give this this next one here is

921
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:37,160
Dendrophilia, which is also known as Arbophilia is the sexual attraction of trees. Yeah, it's cuz you put in your fucking lips all over

922
00:43:37,160 --> 00:43:43,640
You say that again yeah, yeah asshole. This is a sexual attraction of trees

923
00:43:43,640 --> 00:43:46,360
because they are phallic shaped like

924
00:43:47,040 --> 00:43:51,620
Or because they're phallic shape or because of the texture. It's a lot of different textures of trees

925
00:43:51,620 --> 00:43:57,320
I have seen penises and trees on mushrooms before yeah, you just a tree is just made out of fucking it is

926
00:43:57,320 --> 00:43:59,320
I'll fly you know a flower is

927
00:43:59,320 --> 00:44:04,800
Sexual object that's right to a bead or that rose. I can't help myself

928
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:10,040
Yeah, I go to what exhibit Jo Keefe, that's the thing you go to Jo Keefe

929
00:44:10,040 --> 00:44:15,800
And you're like yeah, this is a pussy to a bee I never have wanted to fucking oyster more. Yeah, that's true

930
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:18,380
- Oh my god, well maybe there was one time.

931
00:44:18,380 --> 00:44:19,880
(laughing)

932
00:44:19,880 --> 00:44:20,720
- Yep.

933
00:44:20,720 --> 00:44:21,560
- Yeah.

934
00:44:21,560 --> 00:44:23,200
- Now this one is called figging.

935
00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:26,840
Using the ginger root to create a burning sensation.

936
00:44:26,840 --> 00:44:28,760
Must be peeled and inserted

937
00:44:28,760 --> 00:44:29,600
anally or vaginally. - To create a burning

938
00:44:29,600 --> 00:44:30,720
sensation? - Yeah.

939
00:44:30,720 --> 00:44:32,720
- That's a nightmare dude, it's spicy.

940
00:44:32,720 --> 00:44:33,820
- Yeah. - True.

941
00:44:33,820 --> 00:44:34,660
- That's extreme.

942
00:44:34,660 --> 00:44:35,840
- I can't handle ginger on my food,

943
00:44:35,840 --> 00:44:38,120
let alone on my private area.

944
00:44:38,120 --> 00:44:39,120
- Oh fuck no.

945
00:44:39,120 --> 00:44:41,600
- Gingerbread, hell no, keep that away from me.

946
00:44:41,600 --> 00:44:42,440
- Uh-uh.

947
00:44:42,440 --> 00:44:45,200
- No, and keep the egg out of my nog.

948
00:44:45,200 --> 00:44:49,520
This is great for people who want to fuck the gingerbread man.

949
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:50,520
No.

950
00:44:50,520 --> 00:44:51,520
That's true.

951
00:44:51,520 --> 00:44:53,640
Because then you put that ginger root up inside you.

952
00:44:53,640 --> 00:44:55,240
It would burn to fuck him.

953
00:44:55,240 --> 00:44:57,840
It would burn to fuck you and then you put that thing up inside you and you never want

954
00:44:57,840 --> 00:44:58,840
to fuck the gingerbread man again.

955
00:44:58,840 --> 00:45:00,840
Yeah, well that explains when I fucked that guy.

956
00:45:00,840 --> 00:45:04,000
He said he was the gingerbread man and my pee was burning for days after.

957
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:05,000
Oh, I'm just a...

958
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:06,000
Wait, why did my pee burn?

959
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:07,000
Oh, right, he was the ginger.

960
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:08,000
He was made of ginger root.

961
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:09,000
No, it's fine.

962
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:10,000
I'm just the gingerbread man.

963
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:11,000
What's this boil?

964
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:12,000
Yeah, you boiled it.

965
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:13,000
My pee was fucking boiling, though.

966
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:14,000

they're gonna put a gun to the back of my head, they're gonna make me walk home, go in my house, and they're gonna move

979
00:45:56,680 --> 00:46:00,680
all my stuff onto a van. They're gonna wait for your birthday, get all the Christmas cards. I think they're gonna

980
00:46:00,680 --> 00:46:04,680
really get it. I mean just because I have, it's never happened before, it's gonna happen big. We were all robbed.

981
00:46:04,680 --> 00:46:08,680
2016.

00:46:35,720 --> 00:46:36,720
My warmth.

987
00:46:36,720 --> 00:46:38,720
They can't rob you of your warmth.

988
00:46:38,720 --> 00:46:39,720
My warmth.

989
00:46:39,720 --> 00:46:40,720
My smile.

990
00:46:40,720 --> 00:46:41,720
My joviality.

991
00:46:41,720 --> 00:46:42,720
I was robbed of my smile.

992
00:46:42,720 --> 00:46:43,720
How about your virginity?

993
00:46:43,720 --> 00:46:46,720
That, hey, can't take that away from me, buddy.

994
00:46:46,720 --> 00:46:47,720
Here's what I'm saying.

995
00:46:47,720 --> 00:46:48,720
I lost that age too.

996
00:46:48,720 --> 00:46:54,720
I hope, I hope, I hope to God that somebody comes at me with a gun and robs me of my virginity.

997
00:46:54,720 --> 00:46:56,720
I'm sick of having my V-card.

998
00:46:56,720 --> 00:46:58,720
Get rid of that thing, dude.

999
00:46:58,720 --> 00:47:00,720
Dude, that shit, I don't want to lug that shit around anymore.

1000
00:47:00,720 --> 00:47:01,720
It's so heavy.

1001
00:47:01,720 --> 00:47:02,720
It weighs on you.

1002
00:47:02,720 --> 00:47:03,720
It's annoying.

1003
00:47:03,720 --> 00:47:04,720
It really does.

1004
00:47:04,720 --> 00:47:07,120
Somebody should steal my shit for real.

1005
00:47:07,120 --> 00:47:10,320
Yeah, I didn't actually lose my Virginia too, I lost, I will lose it at 30.

1006
00:47:10,320 --> 00:47:10,820
Yeah.

1007
00:47:10,820 --> 00:47:11,320
You think so?

1008
00:47:11,320 --> 00:47:11,820
Hopefully.

1009
00:47:11,820 --> 00:47:15,820
This next one here, "Caranophilia."

1010
00:47:15,820 --> 00:47:17,820
That's the easiest one to say.

1011
00:47:17,820 --> 00:47:20,820
I'll read this, I got, hey, I got this one.

1012
00:47:20,820 --> 00:47:25,820
"A sexual fascination with thunder and lightning, similar to arousal from thunderstorms, brontophilia.

1013
00:47:25,820 --> 00:47:30,820
You can't incorporate it into your sex, but a thunderstorm makes a good backdrop for sexy times.

1014
00:47:30,820 --> 00:47:33,820
Many people find their levels of desire increase during storms."

1015
00:47:33,820 --> 00:47:37,020
I guess that makes sense. It's like we're all gonna die. It's like yeah. Ooh

1016
00:47:37,020 --> 00:47:39,180
Yeah

1017
00:47:39,180 --> 00:47:46,900
It's also like I'm at your house. It's you're in a dark room. Yeah, you're fucking and then flash a lightning boom

1018
00:47:46,900 --> 00:47:53,520
It's not who I thought it was photography. Whoa. That's a story. That's a movie. That's a short film

1019
00:47:53,520 --> 00:48:00,380
Yeah, five minutes YouTube. No, it doesn't have the strange lover. Yeah, you know, it definitely doesn't have this who friggin Ted

1020

Who Ted from Ted Ted the bear the bear he doesn't?

1021
00:48:05,340 --> 00:48:10,860
He's afraid of this crap. You know who else doesn't let you know who else doesn't have this my dog

1022
00:48:10,860 --> 00:48:14,860
Yeah, my dog has the she's spayed. She barely ever has sex. Yeah

1023
00:48:14,860 --> 00:48:23,060
You're like so um they should I've been thinking about that for a while well

1024
00:48:23,060 --> 00:48:24,620
She I mean she doesn't desire it

1025
00:48:24,620 --> 00:48:28,140
I did kind of pick up Phil when he got neutered and I was like why is his cock still on?

1026
00:48:28,140 --> 00:48:30,300
They're like we don't take his cock off

1027
00:48:30,580 --> 00:48:35,540
I'm gonna get mo neutered dude. He's nuts or yeah, is he trying to like fuck you yet?

1028
00:48:35,540 --> 00:48:39,980
Or does he desire you I don't think he'd understand. He wishes to know you carnally

1029
00:48:39,980 --> 00:48:44,620
He's like humping the catnip toys got

1030
00:48:44,620 --> 00:48:47,500
dude

1031
00:48:47,500 --> 00:48:51,900
Maybe I am maybe I'm neutered cuz I'm like I never want to fuck my toys

1032
00:48:51,900 --> 00:48:56,120
I love those things and I'm never like a cat or a dog before they're neutered

1033
00:48:56,120 --> 00:48:58,260
It's like this is my ball, and I'm gonna fuck it

1034
00:48:58,260 --> 00:49:04,540
I mean, I'm like not fucking my computer, but I play for tonight on there like night by night every night one by one

1035
00:49:04,540 --> 00:49:08,100
More checking off the calendar one by one played it tonight

1036
00:49:08,100 --> 00:49:16,300
One night down five minutes gameplay to do on fortnight place 99 nice this next one here

1037
00:49:16,300 --> 00:49:22,800
Lithophilia a king for rocks and stones or graveled this can be used non sexually yeah

1038
00:49:23,460 --> 00:49:29,220
It's just having a rock collection. I don't can I can it can you have a sexual fetish. That's non-sexual is

1039
00:49:29,220 --> 00:49:34,820
That's cheating like that's just you like it geo dude. Yeah, it's cool. Yeah

1040
00:49:34,820 --> 00:49:39,200
What's the only problem with you Pokemon? Yeah? No cock? He's the one the yeah

1041
00:49:39,200 --> 00:49:46,100
He's got his arms if you like scaring and geo finger play. Yeah, we're past if you like finger

1042
00:49:46,100 --> 00:49:51,820
This is alphabetical right yeah past F. No finger play. Yeah reward will be coming my way

1043
00:49:52,180 --> 00:49:57,200
I'm from who well well this I'm just pulling up. I don't be me. I just pulled up the strangest

1044
00:49:57,200 --> 00:50:03,380
You're the one dressed as Santa Claus. I pulled up the strangest ones. Yeah, okay captain obvious you missed your commercial shoot. Yeah, you're captain

1045
00:50:03,380 --> 00:50:06,060
You're captain Christmas

1046
00:50:06,060 --> 00:50:08,540
Oblivious to what's around this is Captain oblivious

1047
00:50:08,540 --> 00:50:11,920
This next year's oblivious to Captain Oblivious

1048
00:50:11,920 --> 00:50:15,260
Cameron might have oh yeah

1049
00:50:16,300 --> 00:50:22,180
Oh, so I'm into my kink of four mummies where someone is a mummies no daddies

1050
00:50:22,180 --> 00:50:29,800
Yeah, that's true a kink where someone is bound entirely or nearly entirely to prevent almost all movement a vacuum bed can achieve full

1051
00:50:29,800 --> 00:50:36,580
Mummification as can plastic wrap, but it can be dangerous if bindings prevent airflow mummification can also involve extreme temperatures

1052
00:50:36,580 --> 00:50:38,580
So hydration is a must to do it safely

1053
00:50:38,580 --> 00:50:40,780
First of all hydration is a must do basically anything

1054
00:50:43,100 --> 00:50:49,380
Drink a drink water. Yeah, that's a true drink. Yeah every day one glass a day at least yeah

1055
00:50:49,380 --> 00:50:54,420
Under here that just says drink water drink hydrate hydrate

1056
00:50:54,420 --> 00:51:00,260
Mummification is a good one to do cheaply. How could no it can't that's toilet paper mummy

1057
00:51:00,260 --> 00:51:03,940
You guys are fucking up

1058
00:51:03,940 --> 00:51:11,020
This is not that is not the point of this go this shit is that it's about being bound or nearly entirely

1059
00:51:11,020 --> 00:51:12,020
or like a vacuum bag?

1060
00:51:12,020 --> 00:51:15,020
This, okay, I see the issue here. This website, its information is faulty.

1061
00:51:15,020 --> 00:51:16,020
It does seem like...

1062
00:51:16,020 --> 00:51:19,020
Mummification is more about being, wanting to have sex or be a mummy.

1063
00:51:19,020 --> 00:51:20,020
Yeah, I think you're right.

1064
00:51:20,020 --> 00:51:21,020
I think they fucked up the name here.

1065
00:51:21,020 --> 00:51:23,020
I think this is more, this is, um, this is...

1066
00:51:23,020 --> 00:51:24,020
Encealing.

1067
00:51:24,020 --> 00:51:25,020
Encasement.

1068
00:51:25,020 --> 00:51:26,020
This is zip-locking.

1069
00:51:26,020 --> 00:51:27,020
Immure-ment.

1070
00:51:27,020 --> 00:51:28,020
Yeah, exactly.

1071
00:51:28,020 --> 00:51:29,020
Well, here's this one.

1072
00:51:29,020 --> 00:51:31,020
Nullification, a kink for removing any body part.

1073
00:51:31,020 --> 00:51:32,020
This is very dangerous.

1074
00:51:32,020 --> 00:51:35,020
And a nullo is an extreme kink for removing genitals.

1075
00:51:35,020 --> 00:51:40,020
In practice, nullo is very dangerous and can even be fatal.

1076
00:51:40,020 --> 00:51:42,460
Oh, so this explains why people are always saying,

1077
00:51:42,460 --> 00:51:44,340
Google Jerry nullification.

1078
00:51:44,340 --> 00:51:48,580
Whoa, no, they're talking about jury duty.

1079
00:51:48,580 --> 00:51:50,780
It's probably a guy named Jerry.

1080
00:51:50,780 --> 00:51:51,620
And he's nullified?

1081
00:51:51,620 --> 00:51:53,660
He's nullo, they probably want you to see him.

1082
00:51:53,660 --> 00:51:54,980
I don't know what the hell you're talking about.

1083
00:51:54,980 --> 00:51:56,340
What the fuck was that?

1084
00:51:56,340 --> 00:51:59,460
And now you look so damn smug.

1085
00:51:59,460 --> 00:52:01,240
Damn.

1086
00:52:01,240 --> 00:52:02,740
Some experts will get that one.

1087
00:52:02,740 --> 00:52:07,700
These next two are oculonictus.

1088
00:52:07,700 --> 00:52:08,900
Oculolinctus.

1089
00:52:08,900 --> 00:52:10,900
- Oculolingtus and oculophilia.

1090
00:52:10,900 --> 00:52:11,740
- Jokes.

1091
00:52:11,740 --> 00:52:13,300
- These are about the eyeballs.

1092
00:52:13,300 --> 00:52:15,220
I hate when things happen to my eyes.

1093
00:52:15,220 --> 00:52:16,660
- I had a woman when I, not a woman.

1094
00:52:16,660 --> 00:52:17,500
- A woman.

1095
00:52:17,500 --> 00:52:18,320
- You had a woman?

1096
00:52:18,320 --> 00:52:19,160
- When I was a kid.

1097
00:52:19,160 --> 00:52:20,260
- That'd be a first.

1098
00:52:20,260 --> 00:52:21,100
- Come on, man.

1099
00:52:21,100 --> 00:52:23,820
When I was a kid, I had a girl come up to me

1100
00:52:23,820 --> 00:52:25,700
and say she wanted to lick my fucking eyeballs.

1101
00:52:25,700 --> 00:52:26,540
- Ew.

1102
00:52:26,540 --> 00:52:27,740
- She had a little linkedolingctus.

1103
00:52:27,740 --> 00:52:28,580
- I think she had a linkedolingctus.

1104
00:52:28,580 --> 00:52:29,420
- A linkedolingctus.

1105
00:52:29,420 --> 00:52:30,780
- Oh, you put it away.

1106
00:52:30,780 --> 00:52:31,620
- Yeah.

1107
00:52:31,620 --> 00:52:32,440
- Well, here's this next one.

1108
00:52:32,440 --> 00:52:33,280
- And I remember I said,

1109
00:52:33,280 --> 00:52:34,900
how about you suck my damn dick?

1110
00:52:34,900 --> 00:52:35,400
Damn.

1111
00:52:35,400 --> 00:52:35,900
Yeah.

1112
00:52:35,900 --> 00:52:36,740
Science is--

1113
00:52:36,740 --> 00:52:39,380
I think I bloated this list up a lot.

1114
00:52:39,380 --> 00:52:41,040
We're kind of running out of time here.

1115
00:52:41,040 --> 00:52:45,900
Science is fake because it says "lictus,"

1116
00:52:45,900 --> 00:52:47,060
and it's about licking.

1117
00:52:47,060 --> 00:52:51,540
It's like, shouldn't you have a fancier name than oculolictus?

1118
00:52:51,540 --> 00:52:53,260
It's got aphilia, though.

1119
00:52:53,260 --> 00:52:54,060
Oh, what was it?

1120
00:52:54,060 --> 00:52:54,740
Well, this one--

1121
00:52:54,740 --> 00:52:55,580
It doesn't.

1122
00:52:55,580 --> 00:52:57,180
This one here, we'll move on from this.

1123
00:52:57,180 --> 00:52:57,860
Yeah, lictus.

1124
00:52:57,860 --> 00:52:58,860
Yeah, that's lictus.

1125
00:52:58,860 --> 00:52:59,340
Lictus.

1126
00:52:59,340 --> 00:53:00,820
I have a lictus ocula.

1127
00:53:00,820 --> 00:53:02,620
Lictus.

1128
00:53:02,620 --> 00:53:05,700
This one here is Phygeophilia?

1129
00:53:05,700 --> 00:53:08,700
Phygophilia, fetish for being a fugitive on the run.

1130
00:53:08,700 --> 00:53:10,460
(laughing)

1131
00:53:10,460 --> 00:53:14,220
- See, these are all more scenarios that you do.

1132
00:53:14,220 --> 00:53:16,060
- It's less of a fetish, it's more of a fantasy.

1133
00:53:16,060 --> 00:53:18,020
- These are movies that you wanna be in.

1134
00:53:18,020 --> 00:53:19,740
- Yeah, like being on a train car.

1135
00:53:19,740 --> 00:53:22,500
- Yeah, being in a bedroom.

1136
00:53:22,500 --> 00:53:24,020
- Well, I'm thinking of when you're on the run

1137
00:53:24,020 --> 00:53:25,220
on a train car specifically.

1138
00:53:25,220 --> 00:53:27,180
I was elaborating on this one.

1139
00:53:27,180 --> 00:53:28,020
Sorry, I wasn't clear.

1140
00:53:28,020 --> 00:53:29,740
- I would love to get in a box car.

1141
00:53:29,740 --> 00:53:30,580
- Yeah.

1142
00:53:30,580 --> 00:53:33,040
Man, I bet there's some insane parties in those.

1143
00:53:33,040 --> 00:53:33,640
Oh, yeah.

1144
00:53:33,640 --> 00:53:36,440
I always think about like, I always think about this.

1145
00:53:36,440 --> 00:53:39,460
Like you jump on the boxcar and you're like getting away out of town or

1146
00:53:39,460 --> 00:53:43,580
whatever and it's like, oh, it's like 15 hours to the next town that I can get

1147
00:53:43,580 --> 00:53:45,900
off on and I get on there and there's this guy on here with me,

1148
00:53:45,900 --> 00:53:47,500
there's the other hobo and he sucks.

1149
00:53:47,500 --> 00:53:47,900
Yep.

1150
00:53:47,900 --> 00:53:50,660
And I'm like, it's worse than an airplane, there's only one other guy.

1151
00:53:50,660 --> 00:53:51,660
True, but you have more room.

1152
00:53:51,660 --> 00:53:52,340
And he sucks.

1153
00:53:52,340 --> 00:53:54,420
No, you're in one car, you can't switch cars.

1154
00:53:54,420 --> 00:53:55,620
No, but there's like tons of room.

1155
00:53:55,620 --> 00:53:56,820
You can't switch cars.

1156
00:53:56,820 --> 00:53:57,660
It's just one car.

1157
00:53:57,660 --> 00:53:58,260
I guess that's a good point.

1158
00:53:58,260 --> 00:53:58,980
And it's filled with hay.

1159
00:53:58,980 --> 00:53:59,620
A lot of these-

1160
00:53:59,620 --> 00:54:00,500
It's a hay train.

1161
00:54:00,500 --> 00:54:04,420
But also you get into a boxcar and there's like 15,000 iPhones in there.

1162
00:54:04,420 --> 00:54:05,620
It's like, you're fine.

1163
00:54:05,620 --> 00:54:07,620
Not in this time period that I'm thinking of.

1164
00:54:07,620 --> 00:54:09,420
Yeah, 15,000 iPhones, no charger.

1165
00:54:09,420 --> 00:54:13,920
My thing takes place in the 1700s, and maybe it should have been clear about that,

1166
00:54:13,920 --> 00:54:15,320
but there were no iPhones back then.

1167
00:54:15,320 --> 00:54:16,820
Well, yeah, you got to open with that.

1168
00:54:16,820 --> 00:54:18,120
Well, this next one here.

1169
00:54:18,120 --> 00:54:21,020
That's not a problem in the current day, because you can just go on your iPhone.

1170
00:54:21,020 --> 00:54:22,020
That's true.

1171
00:54:22,020 --> 00:54:22,820
When you're in the car.

1172
00:54:22,820 --> 00:54:27,820
Savantophilia, a fetish for people who have a cognitive impairment or delay.

1173
00:54:27,820 --> 00:54:32,420
Speaking of iPhones and homeless guys, I saw a homeless guy in Las Vegas who was on an iPhone.

1174
00:54:32,420 --> 00:54:35,160
And I was like, "Huh, that guy, I didn't really realize he was homeless at first."

1175
00:54:35,160 --> 00:54:38,580
He was on an iPhone, he was using it, and he walked up to a trash can and just threw it in the trash.

1176
00:54:38,580 --> 00:54:41,620
Damn! I'm telling you, dude, they have bands nowadays. They have racks.

1177
00:54:41,620 --> 00:54:43,920
This guy's a fucking millionaire if he's throwing away an iPhone.

1178
00:54:43,920 --> 00:54:44,820
Yeah. Yeah.

1179
00:54:44,820 --> 00:54:48,680
And then he dumped the trash out and he started throwing shit everywhere.

1180
00:54:48,680 --> 00:54:50,120
Yeah. It was a whole kind of thing.

1181
00:54:50,120 --> 00:54:50,820
Yeah. Uh-huh.

1182
00:54:50,820 --> 00:54:52,220
Yeah. It must have been his thing.

1183
00:54:52,220 --> 00:54:54,860
Trash thrower. It must have been like his hobby or his art.

1184
00:54:54,860 --> 00:54:58,060
Yeah, maybe you didn't like the trash being in one place.

1185
00:54:58,060 --> 00:55:01,660
Yeastiality. Sexual activity involving bread, especially warm dough.

1186
00:55:01,660 --> 00:55:06,700
This may be an alleged kink. Introducing yeast to the genitals can lead to an infection.

1187
00:55:06,700 --> 00:55:11,820
So, before we have sex, I have something to tell you. I allegedly...

1188
00:55:11,820 --> 00:55:14,780
Have a donut on my cock.

1189
00:55:14,780 --> 00:55:17,340
I allegedly have a bagel around my cock.

1190
00:55:17,340 --> 00:55:21,740
There might be, and look, it's a little weird.

1191
00:55:21,740 --> 00:55:24,300
Yeah, I allegedly like it when you dress up as a man.

1192
00:55:24,300 --> 00:55:26,300
I may have folded my penis.

1193
00:55:26,300 --> 00:55:27,300
Allegedly.

1194
00:55:27,300 --> 00:55:28,300
10 times.

1195
00:55:28,300 --> 00:55:32,460
Allegedly, I may have folded it 10 times and I want you to put it in the oven so it puffs

1196
00:55:32,460 --> 00:55:33,460
up.

1197
00:55:33,460 --> 00:55:34,460
Butter.

1198
00:55:34,460 --> 00:55:35,460
Butter.

1199
00:55:35,460 --> 00:55:36,460
Butter.

1200
00:55:36,460 --> 00:55:37,460
Yeah.

1201
00:55:37,460 --> 00:55:38,460
If you guys could fuck one pastry, if you could.

1202
00:55:38,460 --> 00:55:39,460
If we could, yeah, if we had the chance.

1203
00:55:39,460 --> 00:55:44,420
If you had the chance to fuck a pastry, which pastry is the most sexual?

1204
00:55:44,420 --> 00:55:45,940
Boston cream.

1205
00:55:45,940 --> 00:55:49,660
Chocolate croissant down the middle, gliding through that warm chocolate.

1206
00:55:49,660 --> 00:55:52,660
I think a hot eclair or something.

1207
00:55:52,660 --> 00:55:53,660
Yeah.

1208
00:55:53,660 --> 00:55:58,300
actually yeah I mean not a jelly donut no people would say jelly don't because I

1209
00:55:58,300 --> 00:56:01,900
think it's funny but it's a bullshit pick there's no hole in a clay we'd have to

1210
00:56:01,900 --> 00:56:06,460
imagine a hole yeah how much how you get sugar up your me ate it sugar up the

1211
00:56:06,460 --> 00:56:11,820
hole is never good that's never good that's never good no maybe okay maybe

1212
00:56:11,820 --> 00:56:16,820
no paste croissant so you're not so it's less chocolatey and more almond and the

1213
00:56:16,820 --> 00:56:20,700
only time it exfoliates your cock and I just like that I like almond smell

1214
00:56:20,700 --> 00:56:22,460
better than chocolate smell when I'm fucking.

1215
00:56:22,460 --> 00:56:23,460
That's fair.

1216
00:56:23,460 --> 00:56:24,780
I actually do love almond smell.

1217
00:56:24,780 --> 00:56:25,780
When you're fucking?

1218
00:56:25,780 --> 00:56:27,860
No, just in general.

1219
00:56:27,860 --> 00:56:28,860
So also when you're fucking.

1220
00:56:28,860 --> 00:56:31,860
I had an old table that was in storage.

1221
00:56:31,860 --> 00:56:33,580
I wiped it down with almond oil.

1222
00:56:33,580 --> 00:56:36,300
And I was like, "Damn, this is a good ass smell."

1223
00:56:36,300 --> 00:56:41,420
Oh, maybe a bag filled with olive oil if that counts as a pastry.

1224
00:56:41,420 --> 00:56:46,140
A bag of frozen olive oil that's warming up throughout the day.

1225
00:56:46,140 --> 00:56:48,540
- The answer for all that stuff is like,

1226
00:56:48,540 --> 00:56:50,660
I guess like a toothpaste tube,

1227
00:56:50,660 --> 00:56:52,780
if you count that as a pastry.

1228
00:56:52,780 --> 00:56:54,420
- It's clearly, I've spent a lot of time

1229
00:56:54,420 --> 00:56:56,140
thinking about what inanimate object

1230
00:56:56,140 --> 00:56:57,820
I would like to fucking try to make it fit

1231
00:56:57,820 --> 00:56:58,860
into every question.

1232
00:56:58,860 --> 00:57:03,600
- This next one here, this is a German word.

1233
00:57:03,600 --> 00:57:06,220
(speaking in foreign language)

1234
00:57:06,220 --> 00:57:08,420
- How is that the one you get?

1235
00:57:08,420 --> 00:57:09,260
- I can read it from here.

1236
00:57:09,260 --> 00:57:11,380
- You fucking can't read anything, but you can read that.

1237
00:57:11,380 --> 00:57:13,460
- I don't even think I said it right.

1238
00:57:13,460 --> 00:57:15,460
Zweichenstufe.

1239
00:57:15,460 --> 00:57:23,620
Okay. It's the sexual obsession with people of the same sex. People have this fetish? That is homosexuality. What the hell are you talking about?

1240
00:57:23,620 --> 00:57:27,140
This is a good camera to keep cutting. That was really good.

1241
00:57:27,140 --> 00:57:30,660
The two angles of it is perfect. Can you do that again?

1242
00:57:30,660 --> 00:57:38,540
Damn, you got three specialties. Just talk about homosexuality for a minute. Just switch between these two cameras. And look, it's okay nowadays,

1243
00:57:38,540 --> 00:57:43,100
okay, they want to... Pretend it's not nowadays and pretend it was way far ago. Okay.

1244
00:57:43,100 --> 00:57:47,140
It's gonna be way okay in the future, okay?

1245
00:57:47,140 --> 00:57:51,100
But for right now you got to keep that shit at the bathhouse

1246
00:57:51,100 --> 00:58:01,520
In the car and in the alleyway, okay, just wait wait like 10 years

1247
00:58:01,520 --> 00:58:11,120
Hey like two years two years now for you cuz it's gonna be on what the hell

1248
00:58:11,120 --> 00:58:15,120
Oh, this can't be. Is this me?

1249
00:58:15,120 --> 00:58:16,120
Oh, that's the plasma ball, Caleb.

1250
00:58:16,120 --> 00:58:17,120
No, that's Caleb.

1251
00:58:17,120 --> 00:58:18,120
No, this is my shoulder.

1252
00:58:18,120 --> 00:58:19,120
That's Caleb's ass.

1253
00:58:19,120 --> 00:58:21,120
Yeah. All right. What's next?

1254
00:58:21,120 --> 00:58:23,120
Next is, oh, here's some comments.

1255
00:58:23,120 --> 00:58:24,120
Oh, Tippy. I know Tippy.

1256
00:58:24,120 --> 00:58:30,120
Yeah, Tippy says, "You missed some, like a balloon fetish. Fornophilia, turning people into furniture.

1257
00:58:30,120 --> 00:58:35,120
Formicophilia, being crawled on by insects. Dendrophilia, trees." That was on there.

1258
00:58:35,120 --> 00:58:36,120
They did not miss that.

1259
00:58:36,120 --> 00:58:37,120
They did not miss that.

1260
00:58:37,120 --> 00:58:38,120
Tippy, you're out.

1261
00:58:38,120 --> 00:58:40,120
Cap-Melonia. All right, Tony Soprano.

00:59:11,960 --> 00:59:12,460
Okay.

1269
00:59:12,460 --> 00:59:14,760
Mechanophilia, having sex with cars and stuff.

1270
00:59:14,760 --> 00:59:15,860
And stuff.

1271
00:59:15,860 --> 00:59:16,360
Yeah.

1272
00:59:16,360 --> 00:59:19,160
I have sex with cars and stuff.

1273
00:59:19,160 --> 00:59:20,360
Just put like a Roomba.

1274
00:59:20,360 --> 00:59:21,160
Yeah.

1275
00:59:21,160 --> 00:59:23,460
Put like a fleshlight on a Roomba, chasing it around the house.

1276
00:59:23,460 --> 00:59:27,160
A Roomba is, for the purpose of fetish, a Roomba is an animal.

1277
00:59:27,160 --> 00:59:27,360
Yeah.

1278
00:59:27,360 --> 00:59:28,160
What's fart?

1279
00:59:28,160 --> 00:59:29,160
That's true.

1280
00:59:29,160 --> 00:59:29,960
True.

1281
00:59:29,960 --> 00:59:30,460
Yeah.

1282
00:59:30,460 --> 00:59:35,360
That's a completely different class from someone who wants to have sex with a wall.

1283
00:59:35,360 --> 00:59:38,160
One day, I hope they make a furry living Roomba.

1284
00:59:38,160 --> 00:59:39,000
- Yeah.

1285
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:40,400
- That lives in one of the books.

1286
00:59:40,400 --> 00:59:43,080
- We should buy a Roomba and put fur and skin on it.

1287
00:59:43,080 --> 00:59:43,920
- Yeah.

1288
00:59:43,920 --> 00:59:46,600
- No, but I wanted to have animatronic eyes

1289
00:59:46,600 --> 00:59:47,440
that go like this.

1290
00:59:47,440 --> 00:59:48,600
- Run around the table while we--

1291
00:59:48,600 --> 00:59:50,880
- We get liquid latex and just cover Roomba--

1292
00:59:50,880 --> 00:59:52,720
- Oh my God, that's such a good idea.

1293
00:59:52,720 --> 00:59:53,560
- With a big nipple in the middle.

1294
00:59:53,560 --> 00:59:55,200
- Dude, we should do that.

1295
00:59:55,200 --> 00:59:56,680
- But I want to have animatronic eyes that go like--

1296
00:59:56,680 --> 00:59:57,520
- Yeah, no, we should build it.

1297
00:59:57,520 --> 00:59:58,360
- Dude, dude, dude.

1298
00:59:58,360 --> 01:00:00,360
- This is the Existenz Roomba.

1299
01:00:00,360 --> 01:00:01,420
- That's incredible.

1300
01:00:01,420 --> 01:00:03,160
- Yeah, it's a great idea for a prop.

1301
01:00:03,160 --> 01:00:04,000
- Wow.

1302
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:04,820
- Wow.

1303
01:00:04,820 --> 01:00:05,840
- For a thing in my house,

1304
01:00:05,840 --> 01:00:10,400
and I use my girlfriend's away. Whoa, clean. So once you get home, it's clean.

1305
01:00:10,400 --> 01:00:12,040
That's okay. That didn't take a tip.

1306
01:00:12,040 --> 01:00:15,640
That didn't take a tip. I'm going to tip it after a sperm on his whole.

1307
01:00:15,640 --> 01:00:17,440
The fuck's wrong with you? What's wrong with you?

1308
01:00:17,440 --> 01:00:19,600
I bristophilia criminals.

1309
01:00:19,600 --> 01:00:21,520
Apo.

1310
01:00:21,520 --> 01:00:26,080
Okay, that's a fetish for being an amputee.

1311
01:00:26,080 --> 01:00:29,240
A base of Philly.

1312
01:00:29,240 --> 01:00:32,960
When you're making these, why don't you just make the size big as you're here?

1313
01:00:32,960 --> 01:00:35,640
You made the slide. I thought I would have my glasses today.

1314
01:00:35,640 --> 01:00:38,120
But I left the house pretty early.

1315
01:00:38,120 --> 01:00:40,800
Right, and your glasses don't load until later in the day.

1316
01:00:40,800 --> 01:00:41,800
No, no, no.

1317
01:00:41,800 --> 01:00:42,800
They're not ready until later.

1318
01:00:42,800 --> 01:00:45,760
People with impaired mobility, mud and quicksand fetish.

1319
01:00:45,760 --> 01:00:47,880
Oh, I got that.

1320
01:00:47,880 --> 01:00:50,240
You got this next one, cholera fever.

1321
01:00:50,240 --> 01:00:51,240
True.

1322
01:00:51,240 --> 01:00:52,240
Clowns.

1323
01:00:52,240 --> 01:00:53,240
I think when I'm old I'll have that.

1324
01:00:53,240 --> 01:00:54,240
Wikipedia lists are often helpful.

1325
01:00:54,240 --> 01:00:55,240
I got that.

1326
01:00:55,240 --> 01:00:56,240
I'm going to wait.

1327

Dude, when I'm 70 or 80, I'm going to go so crazy.

dogs on TV. Really? She had a horse and she went nuts. Phil almost knocked my TV over

1338
01:01:36,020 --> 01:01:39,800
because there was a bird on it the other day. He like went headfirst into it and knocked

1339
01:01:39,800 --> 01:01:44,000
the shit over. I've done that too a few times. Yeah, I mean who hasn't fucking seen... It

1340
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:50,360
looks like a window. Yeah. You know? This next one here... What about reading yourself

1341
01:01:50,360 --> 01:01:55,720
in paper? Joshua Isabel asked that. Joshua, we already talked about mummification. Come

1342
01:01:55,720 --> 01:02:00,560
on motherfucker. You stupid hoe. Fuck you. Fuck you Joshua Isabel. Also this is not a

1343
01:02:00,560 --> 01:02:05,320
brainstorm session. Yeah. You write, say the name of it, the scientific name,

1344
01:02:05,320 --> 01:02:09,120
describe it in detail, and now read this one.

1345
01:02:09,120 --> 01:02:13,280
J.D. Wood says, "Any information on Queen of Spades?"

1346
01:02:13,280 --> 01:02:17,040
And I didn't look up what Queen of Spades meant.

1347
01:02:17,040 --> 01:02:19,840
It would be a pretty good parody song about females.

1348
01:02:19,840 --> 01:02:21,280
"The Queen of Spades?"

1349
01:02:21,280 --> 01:02:23,120
"The Queen of Spades?"

1350
01:02:23,120 --> 01:02:23,920
Yeah.

1351
01:02:23,920 --> 01:02:26,320
"Met her on the fetish list?"

1352
01:02:26,320 --> 01:02:29,040
No, it wouldn't be about fetishes. It would be about how women act.

1353
01:02:29,040 --> 01:02:35,880
Yeah, yeah, it'd probably about cards. Yeah be called hair and it's by the best and it's by the band hair head. Yeah

1354
01:02:35,880 --> 01:02:38,480
Okay

1355
01:02:38,480 --> 01:02:42,080
Next one here

1356
01:02:42,080 --> 01:02:47,140
Sam Cummings says come play. That's true. Come play soon. Now. This is true. I love this

1357
01:02:47,140 --> 01:02:50,520
Less I'm definitely making completion completion

1358
01:02:50,520 --> 01:02:54,680
Completion 330 there's an angel number right here. Oh

1359
01:02:55,840 --> 01:03:01,040
2333 that's pro. That's maybe the first time ever you said something as an age old number and actually was so congratulations

1360
01:03:01,040 --> 01:03:04,740
I'm really proud of you. This is a divine that means this is a divine question

1361
01:03:04,740 --> 01:03:09,560
This is ever 27th divine day does this mean that you used to have more come than you have now?

1362
01:03:09,560 --> 01:03:13,000
When you yeah come or your comes worth less your come is worth

1363
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:18,260
Producing way more true and your girlfriend doesn't even care about any more complete conflation

1364
01:03:18,260 --> 01:03:24,160
She does you come to over my body. I don't even care if it's on my yeah, I come anymore

1365
01:03:24,160 --> 01:03:26,880
There's too much of it. I don't care. It's not individuals

1366
01:03:26,880 --> 01:03:36,480
That's what drove him to invent the green goblin serum

1367
01:03:36,480 --> 01:03:47,620
No, dude is white is is is his wife or girlfriend or whatever, you know, he was like

1368
01:03:47,620 --> 01:03:49,200
He's like can I eat your poopy?

1369
01:03:49,200 --> 01:03:53,640
Harry Butler butthole and she's like no and he's like look at the monster you

1370
01:03:53,640 --> 01:04:02,160
made me and he turned green and he flew out of the window here Jeff Jeff says I

1371
01:04:02,160 --> 01:04:06,120
don't understand why smoking is a fetish left off of nearly every published list

1372
01:04:06,120 --> 01:04:11,240
of fetishes yet is one of one of the most common fetishes we carry enough

1373
01:04:11,240 --> 01:04:17,240
shame already for having a fetish for a socially unacceptable action action it

1374
01:04:17,240 --> 01:04:18,800
It would be nice to be included.

1375
01:04:18,800 --> 01:04:20,040
It would just be nice.

1376
01:04:20,040 --> 01:04:20,880
It would be nice.

1377
01:04:20,880 --> 01:04:22,120
It's like, hey, you're leaving us off

1378
01:04:22,120 --> 01:04:24,760
all these amazing fucking lists.

1379
01:04:24,760 --> 01:04:25,600
Yeah.

1380
01:04:25,600 --> 01:04:26,420
Just include us for a little bit.

1381
01:04:26,420 --> 01:04:28,320
Exactly, I wanna be on the list next to my brothers

1382
01:04:28,320 --> 01:04:30,360
and sisters in the kink community.

1383
01:04:30,360 --> 01:04:33,200
It's messed up what's happening to smokers.

1384
01:04:33,200 --> 01:04:34,400
So next one here, Sienna says,

1385
01:04:34,400 --> 01:04:35,560
"Is there a name for a fetish

1386
01:04:35,560 --> 01:04:36,820
"where you love being trampled

1387
01:04:36,820 --> 01:04:40,000
"because that thing really makes me aroused?"

1388
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:40,840
Yeah.

1389
01:04:40,840 --> 01:04:41,660
Which, yeah, there is.

1390
01:04:41,660 --> 01:04:42,800
I met a guy.

1391
01:04:42,800 --> 01:04:43,800
Mufasophilia.

1392
01:04:43,800 --> 01:04:45,440
Yeah, Mufasophilia.

1393
01:04:45,440 --> 01:04:47,700
(laughter)

1394
01:04:47,700 --> 01:04:49,080
- You all just a fax.

1395
01:04:49,080 --> 01:04:50,280
- The lion kink.

1396
01:04:50,280 --> 01:04:51,120
- Yep.

1397
01:04:51,120 --> 01:04:52,240
(laughter)

1398
01:04:52,240 --> 01:04:55,020
- I'd call it chemophilia based on the guy I met.

1399
01:04:55,020 --> 01:04:55,860
- Okay.

1400
01:04:55,860 --> 01:05:00,000
- OJ, OJ Simpson, he says,

1401
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:05,000
"What about how I like warming up on my Satusamas?"

1402
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:11,040
I like warming up my Satusumas on a radiator

1403
01:05:11,040 --> 01:05:14,120
before squeezing the sticky juice on her.

1404
01:05:14,120 --> 01:05:17,720
this is discriminatory please tell me i'm not the only one with this that what is

1405
01:05:17,720 --> 01:05:22,080
a set to suma i think you can use context clues that suma

1406
01:05:22,080 --> 01:05:23,320
i think that's

1407
01:05:23,320 --> 01:05:27,440
yes for the hands it must be it must be hands or face or whatever but it's a

1408
01:05:27,440 --> 01:05:28,720
type of food

1409
01:05:28,720 --> 01:05:30,440
yes probably food is what it is

1410
01:05:30,440 --> 01:05:34,840
and i got my food up the repeat it or that is a very high like that too but

1411
01:05:34,840 --> 01:05:39,080
that's not sexual that's a very efficient that's a very fetishist emoticon

1412
01:05:39,080 --> 01:05:44,840
Yeah, devilish eyebrows. Yeah. It's next one year. Don't donaldo

1413
01:05:44,840 --> 01:05:52,060
Who want to try ocula linked us hit me up at the Capitol bro. Wait was that yeah?

1414
01:05:52,060 --> 01:05:55,920
That's who I think it is a year after he wasn't the president anymore

1415
01:05:55,920 --> 01:06:00,480
And he said on leap day. That's him announcing another oh

1416
01:06:00,480 --> 01:06:02,760
My God

1417
01:06:02,760 --> 01:06:07,040
Come back to the Capitol to cool. Yeah, that's a cue code. That's true shit

1418
01:06:07,040 --> 01:06:12,960
it. Wait a minute, eyeball, cue code, cue ball, pool, the pool at the White House will be filled

1419
01:06:12,960 --> 01:06:18,320
with insurgents. With eyeball liquors. Liquor, drinking, thinking, I'm thinking. Donald Trump

1420
01:06:18,320 --> 01:06:22,920
has famously never licked a liquor bottle. I'm thinking I will be in the White House

1421
01:06:22,920 --> 01:06:28,920
and attacking. No. Holy cow. I can't finish what this code is telling me. I can't say

1422
01:06:28,920 --> 01:06:33,960
it on air. It'll be too dangerous. But if you want to know what the code is, we'll tell

1423
01:06:33,960 --> 01:06:40,960

I thought I was helping!

1427
01:06:46,040 --> 01:06:47,040
Stop it!

1428
01:06:47,040 --> 01:06:48,040
You fucking suck.

1429
01:06:48,040 --> 01:06:49,280
That's my microphone, you shouldn't do that with mine.

1430
01:06:49,280 --> 01:06:51,120
You can do that with your own.

1431
01:06:51,120 --> 01:06:52,120
I don't care about the windscreen.

1432
01:06:52,120 --> 01:06:54,600
Look, I'm the only one who has the punch-ins, okay?

1433
01:06:54,600 --> 01:06:55,600
I should have...

1434
01:06:55,600 --> 01:06:56,600
Is this your microphone?

1435
01:06:56,600 --> 01:06:57,600
Ooh!

1436
01:06:57,600 --> 01:06:58,600
Ooh!

1437
01:06:58,600 --> 01:07:01,640
Well, you got white fuzz on mine.

1438
01:07:01,640 --> 01:07:02,640
Ooh!

1439
01:07:02,640 --> 01:07:04,000
I'll sing into it if I care.

1440
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:06,480
Okay, then sing to close us out.

1441
01:07:06,480 --> 01:07:08,480
But I also...

1442
01:07:08,480 --> 01:07:10,720
Sing to close us out.

1443
01:07:10,720 --> 01:07:13,240
I know, we actually have stuff to mention.

1444
01:07:13,240 --> 01:07:15,240
You guys are making a mockery and a clownery.

1445
01:07:15,240 --> 01:07:18,440
Before we do the thing that we have to talk about, check out...

1446
01:07:18,440 --> 01:07:21,040
Swagpoop.com just got a low-key makeover.

1447
01:07:21,040 --> 01:07:22,320
- True. - It looks amazing.

1448
01:07:22,320 --> 01:07:24,920
And not only that, if you've ever watched one of these videos

1449
01:07:24,920 --> 01:07:27,320
where I'm shaking my ass as Santa Claus,

1450
01:07:27,320 --> 01:07:30,920
we're talking about fucking licking hairy buttholes as a Spider-Man character.

1451
01:07:30,920 --> 01:07:34,280
And one of us is nervous because he has a vet appointment that he has to go to so he didn't

1452
01:07:34,280 --> 01:07:35,280
do well on this episode.

1453
01:07:35,280 --> 01:07:36,280
Shut up.

1454
01:07:36,280 --> 01:07:37,280
He's getting neutered.

1455
01:07:37,280 --> 01:07:40,920
If you were like, "Yeah, that was so awesome and actually I'm so proud of that, I'd like

1456
01:07:40,920 --> 01:07:42,840
my name on the end of it."

1457
01:07:42,840 --> 01:07:44,440
Then you can do that now.

1458
01:07:44,440 --> 01:07:49,160
Go to patreon.com/podcastsaboutlives for $15 a month to get the Executive Producer tier.

1459
01:07:49,160 --> 01:07:50,160
You will be an Executive Producer.

1460
01:07:50,160 --> 01:07:51,160
You can put your name at the end of an episode.

1461
01:07:51,160 --> 01:07:52,160
You can also put that on your resume.

1462
01:07:52,160 --> 01:07:53,440
You can put that on your resume.

1463
01:07:53,440 --> 01:07:56,920
I will honestly, if you want me to talk to a realtor or something because you used me

1464
01:07:56,920 --> 01:07:57,920
as a reference, that's fine.

1465
01:07:57,920 --> 01:07:58,920
I'm not your Executive Producer.

1466
01:07:58,920 --> 01:07:59,920
That's okay.

1467
01:07:59,920 --> 01:08:04,160
Also exciting part of the executive producer tier, if you're paying $15 a month, once a

1468
01:08:04,160 --> 01:08:10,160
month there will be a shareholder meeting held on Discord, if you want to join the Discord,

1469
01:08:10,160 --> 01:08:12,420
where we will talk about the state of the company.

1470
01:08:12,420 --> 01:08:15,200
And it's business formal, you have to come dressed up.

1471
01:08:15,200 --> 01:08:19,200
And if you come ready to talk business, there will be a Q&A session, we'll do presentations

1472
01:08:19,200 --> 01:08:23,360
about the state of the company of Sullivan the Frog Enterprises, and you'll be able to

1473
01:08:23,360 --> 01:08:24,360
ask questions.

1474
01:08:24,360 --> 01:08:27,760
But, you know, come serious, come ready to work, come ready to talk about the state and

1475
01:08:27,760 --> 01:08:29,320
the future of the company.

1476
01:08:29,320 --> 01:08:30,640
- Not only that, man.

1477
01:08:30,640 --> 01:08:33,320
- We can grade, you can grade us on our performances.

1478
01:08:33,320 --> 01:08:34,800
- Yeah, do we wanna announce the date

1479
01:08:34,800 --> 01:08:36,160
of the first shareholder meeting,

1480
01:08:36,160 --> 01:08:38,040
which I'm trying to remember right now?

1481
01:08:38,040 --> 01:08:38,880
- Yeah.

1482
01:08:38,880 --> 01:08:39,700
- It will--

1483
01:08:39,700 --> 01:08:41,840
- If somebody who has access to a computer could tell us--

1484
01:08:41,840 --> 01:08:44,400
- Somebody could just say it or write it down or show me.

1485
01:08:44,400 --> 01:08:45,240
- Write it down in the PowerPoint.

1486
01:08:45,240 --> 01:08:46,920
- The 16th of December. - The 16th of December.

1487
01:08:46,920 --> 01:08:50,080
- And I believe we said 5 p.m. Eastern time.

1488
01:08:50,080 --> 01:08:51,080
- We have the first one.

1489
01:08:51,080 --> 01:08:52,080
- So make sure, and after that,

1490
01:08:52,080 --> 01:08:54,400
we'll have a standardized day, it is every month.

1491
01:08:54,400 --> 01:08:55,980
But for now, if you're gonna subscribe to that tier,

1492
01:08:55,980 --> 01:08:57,320
you better make sure you do it before then,

1493
01:08:57,320 --> 01:08:59,000
'cause you're gonna miss the shareholder meeting.

1494
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:02,440
- Yep, and make it, let's try to get to $100 million

1495
01:09:02,440 --> 01:09:05,880
so that we can make our Before Sunrise style sunrise movie.

1496
01:09:05,880 --> 01:09:08,480
- If we get to $20,000, we're making a feature film.

1497
01:09:08,480 --> 01:09:09,320
- Yep. - That's right.

1498
01:09:09,320 --> 01:09:11,160
