1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:13,640
I'm so excited to be here with my two little sugar bears. Yeah, honestly, can I

2
00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:16,280
tell you something? I thought we were gonna record it too. Yeah, when I found

3
00:00:16,280 --> 00:00:20,280
out we're recording at noon instead, I was like, yes, really? I get to be here

4
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:23,520
earlier. That's why I wasn't gonna die. I was honestly gonna sit on my couch for

5
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:26,680
two hours. I was maybe gonna go to the grocery store, but I wasn't gonna go to

6
00:00:26,680 --> 00:00:27,680
grocery store.

7
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:28,680
No, no.

8
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:29,680
That's too much.

9
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:30,680
That's too much, man.

10
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:32,000
Going to the grocery store.

11
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:38,520
Speaking of the grocery store, I have a story to tell about, yes, two days ago I was trying

12
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:39,520
to go to the grocery store.

13
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:42,400
Hold on, Sugar Bear, you have an eyelash.

14
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:43,680
Beautiful.

15
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:48,680
I was going to the grocery store and you know that there's that tall guy on my block.

16
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:50,240
No, I don't know.

17
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:53,520
Okay, well there's this guy on my block.

18
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:54,520
He walks up and down.

19
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:56,200
I think his mom follows him.

20
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:58,300
I'm pretty sure he's got schizophrenia,

21
00:00:58,300 --> 00:01:00,700
'cause a lot of the time he's walking around

22
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:03,380
and just making like guttural sounds,

23
00:01:03,380 --> 00:01:05,180
and then his mom is just like making sure

24
00:01:05,180 --> 00:01:08,180
that he's not like doing anything like crazy.

25
00:01:08,180 --> 00:01:09,020
- Okay.

26
00:01:09,020 --> 00:01:09,840
- Not crazy, but like--

27
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:10,900
- He chills with his mom though.

28
00:01:10,900 --> 00:01:12,020
- He's chilling with his mom.

29
00:01:12,020 --> 00:01:13,700
- There's nothing schizophrenic about chilling with mom.

30
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:15,260
- Well, no, he's just walking up and down the street

31
00:01:15,260 --> 00:01:17,620
going, "Gah, gah," like that.

32
00:01:17,620 --> 00:01:19,140
- Like a bug ass on his throat, yeah.

33
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:22,140
- I've never heard him speak a word of,

34
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:26,060
like I've never heard him speak a word, right?

35
00:01:26,060 --> 00:01:31,660
Okay, I've only ever seen him walking up and down the street going and then his

36
00:01:31,660 --> 00:01:35,260
mom and toe behind. He's that guy from that Kendrick Lamar song. He is. He's

37
00:01:35,260 --> 00:01:36,380
got got got got

38
00:01:36,380 --> 00:01:44,820
until two days ago I was walking to the grocery store and it seemed like he was

39
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:50,900
in a very bad mood because he's making a lot of sounds and I passed by him on the

40
00:01:50,900 --> 00:01:53,180
street. I passed by him

41
00:01:54,380 --> 00:01:59,020
and then over my headphones, I hear he does like a boy. If you don't and goes,

42
00:01:59,020 --> 00:02:00,820
you smell like shit at me,

43
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:07,020
I've never heard. Was his mom like, Oh my God, his first one. I don't know if

44
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:11,020
it was like, I've never heard him speak a word of English and he went, you

45
00:02:11,020 --> 00:02:15,940
smell like shit and then just kept walking. My God. And I was like, Oh, no

46
00:02:15,940 --> 00:02:20,580
wonder you bought new jeans. Yeah. Oh, you want me to bring up the jeans now?

47
00:02:22,340 --> 00:02:25,040
He's trying so bad to get to the jeans.

48
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:31,780
But he did like a like, "You smell like shit," and then kept walking as if

49
00:02:31,780 --> 00:02:35,620
nothing, he just did nothing, and I was like, "You guys should have... Yesterday,

50
00:02:35,620 --> 00:02:38,020
you guys should have, like, smelled me."

51
00:02:38,020 --> 00:02:43,700
Did you smell bad? No, no. I was... I went out of my way to make sure I

52
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:47,060
smelled good. Oh, because you were self conscious about what he said. I became

53
00:02:47,060 --> 00:02:48,140
so self conscious.

54
00:02:48,980 --> 00:02:52,880
think about it. I've never heard you speak a word. You've given this man the

55
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:56,800
power of speech. You've bestowed conscious human consciousness upon a

56
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:01,540
green line. I went into his brain, a sims thing. I went up above his head.

57
00:03:01,540 --> 00:03:05,860
Tell me that I smell like you, shit like shit. He was that was a burning bush.

58
00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:13,720
I was like oh my God yeah, no, I put on like I put on like after shave. I put

59
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:19,360
on like do you wear cologne? I do now. I had it. I didn't wear it as much,

60
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:23,720
but now I'm like I did like Jeremy fragrance, like full, like

61
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:30,120
spraying the shit out of myself. The only cologne that I wear is every once

62
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:33,520
in a while, I'll wear this cologne that Noah got me that's called Barack Obama,

63
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:39,640
and it's like a laser blue and it smells terrible, but I'll put it on sometimes

64
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:42,360
'cause it smells like cologne, you know?

65
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:43,620
And everything-- - Oh, it's a cologne.

66
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:44,800
- It gives me like a migraine

67
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:46,000
every time I put it on. - Yeah, I know,

68
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,720
I know the kind of smell you're talking about.

69
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:50,000
It's like-- - I don't fuck with cologne.

70
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,840
- It's the smell, you know the smell that I'm talking about?

71
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:54,040
- I don't even like underwear.

72
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:55,280
- I don't, you didn't say anything.

73
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:58,220
Like the first spray is so pungent,

74
00:03:58,220 --> 00:03:59,960
but then it doesn't smell like anything.

75
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:01,320
- Yes, yeah. - And then it's just like

76
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:04,300
this lingering scent that's like on like your clothes

77
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:05,440
or whatever and you're like-- - Smells like you ate

78
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:06,480
something. - Yeah.

79
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:08,120
It smells like you ate perfume.

80
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:09,400
- It smells like you cooked something,

81
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:13,440
that's what it smells like. It smells like you made your own tea at home. It does not

82
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:16,120
smell very good. No, it smells like herbs and spices. You shouldn't be having that stuff

83
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:22,300
on your skin maybe. That's what I think. It's just a natural. Well, it has to stay there

84
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:27,280
on you. I bet you braid your armpit hair. Oh, I wish. That'd be cool. That'd be so funny

85
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:32,400
if you came in one day with a single dread. You need to become a hippie. I basically have

86
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:37,240
dreadlocks. You don't have dreadlocks. Nowhere close to dreadlocks. I might as well. Then

87
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:40,640
you will just do it. Then, if you might as well, just do it. I'm letting them go.

88
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:44,820
Yeah, I'm seeing people. People still get mad about that. Yeah, about I feel

89
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:49,760
like the window is closing on white guys with dreads. Yeah, I think I will as in

90
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:52,800
terms of them getting in trouble. Yeah, I think it kind of doesn't matter again.

91
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:57,120
I think I think I'm sure people would be. I'm sure that you would run into people

92
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:01,400
who would be like, hmm, oh, but probably in the same way where if you like, you

93
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:05,480
know, you're you're twenty and you wear bell bottom jeans or something. Yeah, so

94
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:10,940
like yeah, it's like just goofy. I want it to live in the Bahamas and have dreadlocks

95
00:05:10,940 --> 00:05:15,180
so bad. I want to dreadlocks too because of corn. Should I get dreadlocks with my current

96
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:18,980
hair? Yeah, yeah, which I'm growing out by the way. You should grow out your hair and

97
00:05:18,980 --> 00:05:24,460
get dreadlocks. I'm gonna get my hair cut soon. There was this kid that I knew he would

98
00:05:24,460 --> 00:05:30,380
like ride BMX bikes. He was in one of my math classes, so he obviously very not a very smart

99
00:05:30,380 --> 00:05:35,760
boy and I saw he like showed up on like the suggested files on Instagram and I

100
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:43,460
was like I wonder what he's up to full drug rug white kid with dreadlocks. We need more of that.

101
00:05:43,460 --> 00:05:49,700
I honestly he like is dressing like a type of guy he's like fully Roz Trent and

102
00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:56,720
it's like I have not seen that type of guy in years and it made me so happy to

103
00:05:56,720 --> 00:06:00,420
know that he's still out there putting on for white dudes.

104
00:06:00,420 --> 00:06:06,520
I saw a white guy with dreadlocks on TV that was very funny that me and me and on Pluto.

105
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:07,520
So I discovered this yesterday.

106
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:12,960
Me and Leo are watching Pluto TV and I have a Pluto TV channel that is a lot.

107
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:17,600
It's live bullfighting live broadcasted and I thought it was the same thing with Pluto

108
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:21,160
where they someday it's not always why it's just all the recycled stuff.

109
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:25,080
But they like the announcer was like you are what like you're watching the what this whatever

110
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:27,920
for both fighting turn in for the people at home watching on Pluto TV, like

111
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:32,820
stick around like it was like fully live and there was one camera operator who

112
00:06:32,820 --> 00:06:36,100
was really bad like it would be like the camera like you know how the bull runs

113
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:40,180
out and the guy is like on it, you know, and it goes very fast yeah and it

114
00:06:40,180 --> 00:06:43,240
starts at the gate and it runs out in the middle and the camera was just like

115
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:47,080
sitting at the pointing at the gate and the bull just immediately runs out with

116
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:49,660
the guy and it just runs out of frame and the camera just sits there on the

117
00:06:49,660 --> 00:06:53,040
gate and then you can see that the camera got picked up and turned really

118
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:57,440
past, like someone with Julio, like someone was like like someone's like oh

119
00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:00,740
fuck and like quickly turned it to follow her like who's that camera operator and

120
00:07:00,740 --> 00:07:03,720
then from another angle we looked to see like who's filming from that area. It

121
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:05,340
was a really old white guy with

122
00:07:05,340 --> 00:07:11,660
with white dress. Was this bull fighting? Was this bull fighting taking place in

123
00:07:11,660 --> 00:07:15,820
America? Was this an American both? Oh really yeah, it was well. They had one

124
00:07:15,820 --> 00:07:19,660
that was fighting or riding. There was both okay, oh they and they also had

125
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:22,360
barrel racing, which we did not. Also, one of the announcers was a

126
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:26,200
rodeo clown type guy who was just there's also nobody in the audience.

127
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:29,960
Yeah, so sparse. Nobody cares about this event. I would be there. I know

128
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:33,320
I think it was a kind of York, but no one no one no one cared about it.

129
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:37,440
The announcer is this rodeo clown guy who's got the clown makeup on, but

130
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:39,720
he's not dressed like a clown. Other than that, he just has clown makeup.

131
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:44,080
Yeah, and he's what he has just like a like a Bluetooth headset type mic and

132
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:46,800
he's the announcer. So he's just walking around and trying to kill time where

133
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:50,260
like get wrangling the bowls and he just being like everybody clap along to the

134
00:07:50,260 --> 00:07:53,720
song and you can just like see him. He's walking around and then, when the

135
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:58,180
bowl comes out, he climbs into a barrel and he's walking around like a Mario

136
00:07:58,180 --> 00:08:01,120
enemy or his head is poking out of the top of the barrel and his feet are out

137
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:04,560
of the bottom, and if the bowl comes near him, he goes inside the barrel like

138
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:06,360
a turtle. Whoa, it's

139
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:11,640
barrel barrel beats bull like rock, paper, scissors, apparently yeah, he

140
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:14,880
seemed completely fine. Oh my God, just walking around in the bear. It's so

141
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:17,560
really funny, though, because you see him just talking and be like, well, the

142
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:21,300
next person we have going up and he's like just walking, waddling a barrel.

143
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:26,020
We should do an episode in a bullpen, yeah, where we are trying to avoid

144
00:08:26,020 --> 00:08:30,040
getting to be it. I also look thought that I could by looking at at least the

145
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:33,560
bull fighting. I could do that. Yeah, I mean, I don't think I mean, you always

146
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:37,120
think all you do is well, it's just a man. It's like a thing that all men

147
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:40,700
think that they can do all men. All men can do watch this, because what they do

148
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:43,400
is they just stand there and they go like this is the bull. They wave their

149
00:08:43,420 --> 00:08:46,320
arms and then the ball runs at them and then they step to the side and the ball

150
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:49,560
runs by yeah. Bulls can only run straight yeah. I've learned this from

151
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:52,200
that's all it is. They jump out of the way and then it's always like they get

152
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:55,560
they have like a time limit. They have to do it for and it's like half they're

153
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:58,000
doing like all these like dodges or whatever and then the other half that

154
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,880
is go stand on the other side and the bull doesn't run at them or anything.

155
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:04,680
Yeah, the bull is not that interested in fighting because they scored on points.

156
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:07,800
So it's all just about like if you want to get style, you just have to do cool

157
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:12,200
stuff. I did like a jumped and did a flip over a bowl and stuff. Oh, you and

158
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:15,680
definitely get him. Yeah, I would not you get him. I'd be a great clown. You

159
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:18,720
will be a good clown. I'd be good at the barrel. I'd be good at the barrel.

160
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:21,880
You could be the barrel guy. You should all be the barrel guys. Three barrel

161
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:27,120
guys. We walk out. Oh, you know what we do? One barrel comes out. Patrick's

162
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:30,840
head pops out. Oh, there's the guy in the barrel. Wait, there's another head.

163
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:34,600
Wait, there's a third head. Three guys in one barrel. We're in like a whiskey

164
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:38,000
cask. Not even that big of a barrel. We're really stuck. Yeah, they're gonna

165
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:42,040
have to dismantle the barrel to get us out. Yeah. Was there like, is it like

166
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:47,540
pro wrestling where people have different kind of different attributes. So the the

167
00:09:47,540 --> 00:09:51,580
bull fighting, it was like yeah. They all had like themed outfits kind of

168
00:09:51,580 --> 00:09:55,120
they were all dressed in these crazy outfits that were like partly cowboy,

169
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:57,940
like with the cowboy hat and the fringe, but then also looked a little bit like a

170
00:09:57,940 --> 00:10:01,120
NASCAR outfit where they had like the branding and the monster energy and the

171
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:04,920
Arctic Fox and whatever, but then also they had clown elements as well. I was

172
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:07,680
going to say they were wearing like truly insane outfits that I've never

173
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:10,120
seen and they all yeah. One of them was named. Oh fuck. What was his name

174
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:15,280
Sasquatch there's a guy named Sasquatch. Is there any of them that actually try

175
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:16,120
to hurt the bull?

176
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:20,400
Not that I well, it's a disqualification. Why though that's

177
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:26,400
it's not animal. It's human cruelty creatures. The bull is trying to kill

178
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:31,000
the guy. Yeah, you can fight back. Look, why he could not be in the I have no

179
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:31,800
I'd have no

180
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:37,040
sympathy for the bowl. The bowl is charging straight ahead at a clown. It

181
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:40,200
is so funny to me. We're talking about this to her watching it that they they

182
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:44,840
engineer these animals lives where these the bulls are living such an evil,

183
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:49,640
terrible, horrific, miserable life here, how that that they've engineered it so

184
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:53,920
that when a bull, the bull is standing in a like a metal gated room and they

185
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:57,920
open the gate instantly. The thing that the bowl instantly knows it needs to do

186
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:00,480
is it needs to run out in a straight line and kill the first

187
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:05,520
because they don't like do anything like it's just in there. They open the door

188
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:08,840
and it runs out and tries to kill. I had an amazing like thirteen year old

189
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:11,580
fought the other day where I was thinking I was like and I

190
00:11:11,580 --> 00:11:18,000
this really I blew my own mind and I was like you know what dude as you as the

191
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:22,640
quality of life for humans in the world has gone way up. The quality of life for

192
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:28,840
animals has plummeted. Yeah, that is so there's more so fighting animals used to

193
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:34,160
walk around and just chill. I think my my thirteen year old thought that I think

194
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:38,520
literally probably four times a week and I blow my mind with it every single time

195
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:43,380
is that, can you believe that humans are animals and they built cities and cities are like

196
00:11:43,380 --> 00:11:44,380
big ant hills.

197
00:11:44,380 --> 00:11:45,380
Wow.

198
00:11:45,380 --> 00:11:48,120
You look at your phone and it's just like I shouldn't have that.

199
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:49,120
Yeah.

200
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:50,120
This shouldn't exist.

201
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:51,120
Yeah.

202
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:53,000
It's just crazy to me that we, that we're animals that did all this crap.

203
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:56,640
And I'm looking on my phone and I'm looking up how did this phone get made.

204
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:57,640
Uh huh.

205
00:11:57,640 --> 00:12:03,440
And I'm like who the fuck, like a hundred years ago, you know, not to get all, most

206
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:07,440
of the 13 year old thought in my brain is like oh my god you show like a person from the

207
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:12,400
in the 1800s, one picture on an iPhone, they're going to fucking kill themselves.

208
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:18,160
I want to live in Mesopotamia. Yeah, so bad. Me too. I want ancient technology.

209
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:21,960
I don't like this new technology. You want like Dunmer? I want a piece of rock

210
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:25,840
with blue lines that move through it. Yeah. Blue glow lines. Legend of Zelda,

211
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:29,520
the Breath of the Wild. I want that kind of thing. I want the Dwemer stuff. I

212
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:33,040
want like the stuff from Skyrim that like you go in the caves and then it's

213
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:37,420
all like this gold plated like guys on the little ball. I want no technology

214
00:12:37,420 --> 00:12:41,160
at all. I would like to live in the world of weathering heights. My wife made fun

215
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:45,020
of me because she said if you could go back in time and to any time what and

216
00:12:45,020 --> 00:12:51,660
see like anything in the past, what would you say? She said dinosaurs. I said I

217
00:12:51,660 --> 00:12:54,540
went to see the the hanging gardens of Babylon.

218
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:57,740
Yeah, she's funny for that. She said I was gay.

219
00:12:57,740 --> 00:13:01,100
My own wife said I was

220
00:13:01,100 --> 00:13:03,980
I wanted to see the hanging gardens of

221
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:09,060
they're stupid man. They're bad ass gardens. It's probably hang or wonders

222
00:13:09,060 --> 00:13:12,840
than yeah. I did, but you don't know because you've never seen it man. I

223
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:16,500
would want to see Colossus. You would feel so disappointed you would get

224
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:20,300
there and you'll be like that's a fucking tree. Wow wow and then your

225
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:22,460
your way to get back after seeing a million

226
00:13:22,460 --> 00:13:24,080
yeah

227
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:25,520
not

228
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:33,020
bone might as well be an alien like the most she's got like new cavemen friends,

229
00:13:33,060 --> 00:13:36,560
they had different flowers that we've never had. They had even more

230
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:39,460
different flowers back in dinosaur times, bro. I don't want to go to

231
00:13:39,460 --> 00:13:42,780
dinosaur time. I don't want to be mosquitoes. What if you go to the

232
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:46,460
hanging gardens or whatever and they got different flowers back then and you

233
00:13:46,460 --> 00:13:51,300
have the like worst allergic reaction to the you also you would you would not

234
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:54,380
know you would not be looking at these flowers and be you would you would look

235
00:13:54,380 --> 00:13:57,320
at a flower and you'd be like oh my God, this is an ancient flower. They don't

236
00:13:57,320 --> 00:14:00,340
have any more and they'll be like yeah, that's called a tulip. Yeah, no, you

237
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:05,060
I know flowers, you know, I used to be a gardener shut up. You were not a car.

238
00:14:05,060 --> 00:14:09,760
I was I had a container garden on my dad's back deck. Oh my God, you guys are

239
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:13,340
so fucking stupid. I had a container garden with over thirty different

240
00:14:13,340 --> 00:14:18,180
flowers on my dad's back deck and me. Oh my God, name all the flowers name all

241
00:14:18,180 --> 00:14:22,500

00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:23,220

243
00:14:26,020 --> 00:14:28,580
keep going a tulip. Okay,

244
00:14:28,580 --> 00:14:32,860
that was you can't tell a naming of our said it. I just said Lily

245
00:14:32,860 --> 00:14:38,420
a these are all women's. These are the flowers you had a dumb dumb. That's a

246
00:14:38,420 --> 00:14:40,340
yeah. Okay, that's a pop a

247
00:14:40,340 --> 00:14:44,700
what sucker, but the sucker yeah, no it's not a pop. That's a sucker man.

248
00:14:44,700 --> 00:14:48,620
The say what are they called? It's a sucker. What are those perennials that

249
00:14:48,620 --> 00:14:53,540
are always that you can get an eal perennial is a not a kind of flower.

250
00:14:53,580 --> 00:14:56,820
it's not a kind of flower. It's a name. What are they called? They're the ones

251
00:14:56,820 --> 00:15:00,300
that you can plant anywhere and they live forever. Fern no, not a fern ferns,

252
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:03,200
not a flower for here's one. Here's one. I'll blow your fucking mind

253
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:08,520
chrysanthemum hydrangea chrysanthemum. Okay, hydrangea hibiscus.

254
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:12,500
These are the kinds of flowers. I was rocking with. You had all these flowers

255
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:17,740
in a container. A container garden means that you have pots instead of instead of

256
00:15:17,740 --> 00:15:21,460
row. You had all these yeah, you had roses. I had roses. I had two rose

257
00:15:21,460 --> 00:15:24,260
rosemary and they would hurt me rosemary, not a flower. That's an herb.

258
00:15:24,260 --> 00:15:28,260
We had no food, no herb, anything bad idea, putting just flowers out there.

259
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:31,740
You should always just put herbs out. Oh, this guy hates beauty. No, I like

260
00:15:31,740 --> 00:15:34,900
food crocus. I like crocus. Those are good flowers. I never seen a crocus.

261
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:38,300
You've never seen a crocus. You've seen a crocus. I've never seen one. You've

262
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:40,860
seen it. You have definitely seen a crocus. Azaleas are good too. We had

263
00:15:40,860 --> 00:15:43,740
azaleas. Well, azaleas are actually bad because they only bloom for two weeks

264
00:15:43,740 --> 00:15:47,020
out of the year. Well, they're good. And then it's like the ugliest fucking

265
00:15:47,020 --> 00:15:50,300
thing ever. We had hydrangeas and crocus. Well, crocuses, you don't really grow.

266
00:15:50,340 --> 00:15:53,340
they just they pop up. I think my mom would have that's a we just on the

267
00:15:53,340 --> 00:15:57,380
porch. Yeah, those are the ones that come up during spring. They're a little

268
00:15:57,380 --> 00:16:03,760
tiny purple. It was one flower that irises irises. I used to propagate man.

269
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:06,920
Yeah, that's how hard that's how heavy into this shit. I was. I used to

270
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:11,000
propagate things when I was like you're not really helping your case really of

271
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:15,400
being lame or gay or anything like that. I think he proved that he knows bad

272
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:20,960
ass, man. Flowers? That shit is badass to own flowers and cultivate them.

273
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:25,720
When I was like six years old, I didn't, I mean, I still to this day couldn't point out

274
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:27,680
the different types of poisonous plants.

275
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:31,400
Me neither. I don't understand.

276
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:34,760
I tried to make homemade camouflage as you do as a child.

277
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:35,760
Ghillie.

278
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:40,200
I tried to make a ghillie suit. I tried to make a ghillie suit by stuffing plants and

279
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:41,560
stuff into my shirt.

280
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:42,560
Inside your shirt?

281
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:48,620
I was doing this, I was like putting like, like, like plants in my pants and then my

282
00:16:48,620 --> 00:16:51,680
shirt so it would stick out because I thought that it would hide me.

283
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:56,720
So I was putting like plants up my back and stuff and it turns out like half of them were

284
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:59,440
poison ivy and for...

285
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:01,840
You made a poison, you made some, you made a...

286
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:02,840
A poison ivy...

287
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:03,840
A green maiden.

288
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:05,680
Yeah, I don't know what that is but...

289
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:06,680
Like an iron maiden?

290
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:09,020
Oh, but with, okay, yeah, then I did that.

291
00:17:09,020 --> 00:17:12,420
I did that and I got to stay home from school for two days, but it was the

292
00:17:12,420 --> 00:17:14,780
itchiest two days of my life.

293
00:17:14,780 --> 00:17:16,740
I was covered in fucking...

294
00:17:16,740 --> 00:17:18,780
We had like this expired calamine lotion.

295
00:17:18,780 --> 00:17:23,060
It was just like this pink fucking goop that I was pouring all over my body.

296
00:17:23,060 --> 00:17:24,380
I was more pink than anything.

297
00:17:24,380 --> 00:17:25,380
Pink slime, man.

298
00:17:25,380 --> 00:17:26,380
I was a pink...

299
00:17:26,380 --> 00:17:27,380
I looked like Mr. Bubble.

300
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:28,380
You looked like Patrick Star probably.

301
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:29,380
Bubble gum, man.

302
00:17:29,380 --> 00:17:30,380
I don't think I ever got poison ivied.

303
00:17:30,380 --> 00:17:31,380
I got poison ivied a couple times.

304
00:17:31,380 --> 00:17:32,380
Are you one of those guys that aren't allergic to it?

305
00:17:32,380 --> 00:17:33,380
Maybe.

306
00:17:33,380 --> 00:17:34,380
I probably have gotten it and not realized.

307
00:17:34,380 --> 00:17:35,380
I don't know.

308
00:17:35,380 --> 00:17:36,380
I don't know.

309
00:17:36,380 --> 00:17:37,380
I don't know.

310
00:17:37,380 --> 00:17:38,380
I don't know.

311
00:17:38,380 --> 00:17:39,580
I realized me. Yeah,

312
00:17:39,580 --> 00:17:47,380
well, I don't know. I don't think I've ever gotten it, but it seems I mean

313
00:17:47,380 --> 00:17:51,080
it's not like I'm going to you've gotten it. It was so bad that you deleted

314
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:54,780
the memory from your head. It was so painful. That's not true. It's

315
00:17:54,780 --> 00:17:57,980
completely true. It's what I would know if I gotten it. I wouldn't be able

316
00:17:57,980 --> 00:18:01,580
to. I wouldn't it's not conceivable that maybe I got a rash or something

317
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:03,180
and thought it was a random rash. Yeah,

318
00:18:03,180 --> 00:18:06,180
that's a good point. I think you would know it's

319
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:11,040
raises up on your white body and it hurts so bad.

320
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:13,040
Yeah, you get little pustules.

321
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:14,040
I thought it was just itches.

322
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:15,540
You get little pustules that you can pop.

323
00:18:15,540 --> 00:18:16,540
Yeah, it gets disgusting.

324
00:18:16,540 --> 00:18:22,040
My mom told me that if you pop them, then that can spread and just make the itch worse.

325
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:26,760
Yeah, I always heard the story of my great whatever, you know, someone you hear, always

326
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:29,880
hear the story someone burns it to get rid of it and this oil and the smoke goes under

327
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:30,880
their lungs.

328
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:31,880
Yeah.

329
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:32,880
You probably heard that story.

330
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:33,880
No, what happens?

331
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:34,880
Well, I don't know if it's true or not.

332
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:35,880
I feel like maybe it's one of those things.

333
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:36,880
It's a wives tale.

334
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:40,840
Yeah, but like you, the story of, I was always told that someone in my family, some great

335
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:44,560
grandma or aunt or something, burned a bunch of poison ivy on her property to get rid of

336
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:48,160
it and the smoke, the oils on it, the irritating oils go into the smoke and you breathe it

337
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:49,880
in and you get it inside your body.

338
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:51,160
Yeah, that shit's the worst.

339
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:52,360
But I don't know if that's true or not.

340
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:55,400
Do you guys have skunks in the northeast?

341
00:18:55,400 --> 00:19:01,720
Yeah, my uncle got sprayed by, he had this Australian shepherd that like tried to bite

342
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:03,520
a skunk and it sprayed him immediately.

343
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:04,520
They're so stupid.

344
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:07,620
is the worst smell because I can smell it in my house.

345
00:19:07,620 --> 00:19:13,340
That's scary week. Nope. One time ago. I haven't seen a skunk in a long time.

346
00:19:13,340 --> 00:19:17,020
I've skunk walked right in front of them though. If they didn't spray their

347
00:19:17,020 --> 00:19:20,680
stink everywhere, I think they would be amazing pets. I like their coloration.

348
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:24,320
Yeah, yeah. The stripe, the stripe is cool. The stripe is cool. I do love

349
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:28,340
the skunk. It is a good is God's perfect. Have anyone domesticated?

350
00:19:28,340 --> 00:19:29,740
Yeah, I've seen

351
00:19:30,980 --> 00:19:36,580
It's it's illegal to take their gland out. Yeah, because you they need that.

352
00:19:36,580 --> 00:19:42,680
It's like that to to make it's like a cat like it's very immoral, but in the

353
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:46,080
UK, I think you can look at these animals land to them. I mean, dude, you

354
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:50,180
can do whatever the hell you're a cuter one in Russia. This picture looks

355
00:19:50,180 --> 00:19:53,880
fucked up, man. I mean, we've talked about it every which way, but you know

356
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:57,680
you can just own a caracal cat in Russia. Oh, look at the one with the

357
00:19:57,680 --> 00:20:01,440
the bow. Click that one. Click the one with the bow on it. I always love when

358
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:06,200
they put a bow on a female skunk. Wow! You always love when they put a bow on

359
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:10,400
a female skunk. It's the stinkiest creature in the world, and then they've

360
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:14,280
made it look cute. This is a free Twitter profile picture to somebody who's

361
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:19,520
really annoying. To some very annoying woman. That's a freebie for you. Why has

362
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:21,520
it got to be an... Also, how do you know that's a female? What, because they

363
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:24,000
wear... You're wearing female jeans today. Well, it could be a bow tie.

364
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:26,740
but that could be a bow tie and the sky doesn't know where to wear it.

365
00:20:26,740 --> 00:20:28,240
Show the jeans. Show the jeans. Show them.

366
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:32,440
Okay, now stand up on the chair. Okay.

367
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:39,740
They're just a little bit thin, like skinnier than the jeans I normally wear.

368
00:20:39,740 --> 00:20:41,340
They're really blue, man. Yeah.

369
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:45,040
What's wrong with where I was? I was saying, as I look into these and I'm

370
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:48,840
start to get like nitrogen narcosis, I feel like I'm getting raptured of the

371
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:51,740
deep. I'm getting drawn down into the depths of the ocean.

372
00:20:51,740 --> 00:20:55,100
It's just my scuba tank has run out of oxygen.

373
00:20:55,100 --> 00:20:56,780
I'm looking taper a little bit.

374
00:20:56,780 --> 00:20:57,780
I'm looking down.

375
00:20:57,780 --> 00:20:59,900
The only thing that's wrong with I'm looking down at the sea floor.

376
00:20:59,900 --> 00:21:03,260
I think I'm looking up at the at the surface and I'm swimming down down.

377
00:21:03,260 --> 00:21:05,100
I'm seeing a ring of glowing lights.

378
00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:06,700
They stretch, too.

379
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:10,700
I bet there's a colony of of James Cameron aliens living inside those pants.

380
00:21:10,700 --> 00:21:13,020
Went all the way up his pants, pinching and I felt nothing.

381
00:21:13,020 --> 00:21:14,820
I just got to say that.

382
00:21:14,820 --> 00:21:15,900
I just got to say that.

383
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:20,100
I just feel like I have to say that I felt absolutely nothing in his nose.

384
00:21:20,100 --> 00:21:24,740
These are pants that a human sized doll would wear. I'm looking at these are

385
00:21:24,740 --> 00:21:28,260
these are doll panties. That's what's disturbing about it. There's so

386
00:21:28,260 --> 00:21:32,700
it's this seam right here. Yeah, this is the doll seam. It's the Carhartt

387
00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:37,980
whips. WIPs. Oh, they're Carhartt. Oh, I take every then they're actually

388
00:21:37,980 --> 00:21:42,220
badass. I do. I do like them. They're just so they I've never seen that much

389
00:21:42,220 --> 00:21:45,860
today. Shade of blue on you before. Yeah, you guys are just you guys are just

390
00:21:47,020 --> 00:21:51,420
it's like when a father shaves his beard. Yeah, you know, I'm not wearing some

391
00:21:51,420 --> 00:21:55,740
like I'm not wearing some ratty old jeans. I bought new jeans and you guys

392
00:21:55,740 --> 00:21:56,260
are freaking

393
00:21:56,260 --> 00:22:01,660
I don't know why we're yeah, they're pretty normal. Oh my God, they are

394
00:22:01,660 --> 00:22:05,860
really causing reaction. Okay, hold your arms up over your head. Look at this.

395
00:22:05,860 --> 00:22:09,000
He's got the ocean down here, then he's got the forest up here and there's the

396
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:14,020
beautiful white clouds. Oh my God, and the orange sun. Yeah, wait, you're

397
00:22:14,060 --> 00:22:18,660
dress like the earth. You are dressed like my shoes and my shoes are great.

398
00:22:18,660 --> 00:22:23,520
My shoes are gray like rock station really bedrock that total. Those are

399
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:27,640
my craft bedrock shoes under the ocean. Wait, they actually look exactly like

400
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:30,760
bedrock. Yeah, I like your earth fit man.

401
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:35,780
I am in the world. You should fit. I like your earth fit. You should dress up

402
00:22:35,780 --> 00:22:40,480
like more planets. Speaking of the I'll do that. Maybe all of next week

403
00:22:42,380 --> 00:22:46,420
months of I want to see Jupiter. How many episodes wait? How many episodes do

404
00:22:46,420 --> 00:22:46,940
we have?

405
00:22:46,940 --> 00:22:51,580
How do I how do we there's there's many episodes of yeah? How many episodes do

406
00:22:51,580 --> 00:22:55,180
we have in a month? Typically is what I mean well, eight or eight in a month

407
00:22:55,180 --> 00:22:59,500
years, nine planets yeah well, unless you don't count Pluto. If you don't

408
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:03,580
count Pluto, there's eight eight. We could definitely I think also well,

409
00:23:03,580 --> 00:23:06,700
also you could do planets. You knocked earth out already, so you can do the

410
00:23:06,700 --> 00:23:10,780
mouth of planets yeah. They can do this without earth the month of, but I want

411
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:13,800
see the sun to I'm not going to yeah. I would like to also see the sun and the

412
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:16,860
moon. I would really get a bonus, a bonus. You know, like those people,

413
00:23:16,860 --> 00:23:20,620
those people that do like is like outfits inspired by

414
00:23:20,620 --> 00:23:25,540
character. Next month, can we do the month of planets where each of us we're

415
00:23:25,540 --> 00:23:27,940
all doing it and dresses Patrick? We all come in

416
00:23:27,940 --> 00:23:33,560
that's not we all have to be like every week we come as the same plan. Yeah,

417
00:23:33,560 --> 00:23:36,660
we can do that. We could do that yeah. I think that right now this is kind of

418
00:23:36,700 --> 00:23:38,360
perfect earth outfit yeah

419
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:42,440
for I guess I have earth colors. I've got green and blue and I've got green

420
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:46,000
and blue on my shoes too. I could do really blue that's more green and you

421
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:51,680
are green. Mars might be too easy, but we got to do them all. Mars is easy.

422
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:54,940
What what planets are there? Mars and Neptune? These are these are easy.

423
00:23:54,940 --> 00:23:59,000
These are these are my very eager Mars, Mercury, Venus, Earth,

424
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:09,340
butters Mars, Martyrs Jupiter, Saturn, Neptune, Pluto Neptune, Uranus Uranus

425
00:24:09,340 --> 00:24:16,620
Uranus, Uranus, Pluto Neptune, Uranus before Neptune, then Pluto, us nine

426
00:24:16,620 --> 00:24:17,180
yeah

427
00:24:17,180 --> 00:24:22,040
okay, we can do that and then the sun as a bonus week and Mercury,

428
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:26,980
okay, Mercury, I will be the regular good about Mercury and then the moon

429
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:31,600
will be the bonus episode for that. We yeah, so we'll do five weeks of planets

430
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:36,240
of planets. Okay, Mercury, the five weeks, let's say what we know about

431
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:39,560
planets. The five weeks of November is five weeks of planets. Well, we can

432
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:43,040
start planning our so Merk, we'll start with Mercury. We can plan it. We can

433
00:24:43,040 --> 00:24:46,680
plan it. We can plan the month. Yeah, this is such a good idea. The

434
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:50,760
ideas for episodes of what to do for the episodes. They could be different that

435
00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:54,080
we could just do a whole every episode is about the planets that we're dressed

436
00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:59,480
up as yeah and we talk as the pie. We say I have a toxic atmosphere. I can I

437
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:03,520
would pull up my third grade. I did a project on Mercury. That's huge. What

438
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:07,040
did you spit about Mercury? What do you know? What do you use the rotation

439
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:11,320
around the sun one year in Mercury, the revolution, the one one year for

440
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:16,920
Mercury, eighty eight days really yeah. Well, so how old was you be on Mercury

441
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:20,100
to the sun closest one of the sun? I don't know how old I would be on

442
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:25,880
Mercury. It's hot as fuck. I can't do the math. I'm not going to lie. Basically,

443
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:28,720
scientists call Mercury the sun's moon.

444
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:31,600
No, they don't. That's not true.

445
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:36,480
Why would a scientist say something so stupid? Scientists have been calling

446
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:40,640
Mercury, like, the sun's moon. Is that what you... What was your go to science

447
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:43,920
fair project when you were a kid? I didn't have the science fair. Yeah, I

448
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:47,960
don't think I had a science fair either. Or like, you had to make a diorama or

449
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:51,800
Oh, we I'm going to die around about walruses, the diorama that we had to

450
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:55,060
beavers to why are you being so different? Yes, that's what I'm asking.

451
00:25:55,060 --> 00:25:59,100
Yes, that's what I want. I want to know what walruses and beavers, whatever.

452
00:25:59,100 --> 00:26:03,080
Okay, it's you don't have to be so mean about it. We did a we did a thing

453
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:03,560
called

454
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:06,840
we did a thing called bottle guys,

455
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:12,160
which if you remember bottle guys, you remember bottle guy dot com. I remember

456
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:14,520
well, bodily you took a

457
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:22,440
You took a two liter bottle and then a little like styrofoam ball or whatever and then you'd

458
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:25,120
have to do like a history project on them.

459
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:26,760
They would put them out in the hallway.

460
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:28,760
And I did mine on Lou Gehrig.

461
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:31,160
Oh, very cool.

462
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:34,280
Did you guys follow the I did a rod?

463
00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:35,280
Yes.

464
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:36,280
My guy did not win.

465
00:26:36,280 --> 00:26:37,280
What the hell that is?

466
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:38,280
Mine neither.

467
00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:39,280
The sled race, the dog sled race.

468
00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:43,240
It's what the movie Snow Dogs is about.

469
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:49,040
Africa. Yeah, my something's wrong with me. Snowy Africa, snowy Africa. There's

470
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:52,440
some parts of Africa that are snowy where the middle of the mountains.

471
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:58,440
Yeah, probably the south part. Did you guys do an egg drop challenge? No, I

472
00:26:58,440 --> 00:27:01,640
drop an egg into the pan and fry it every morning. Not a challenge. It was a

473
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:04,440
challenge for me. I wasn't very good at it in third grade. I did the sun drop

474
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:08,340
challenge. Mm-Hmm. Where drink two bottles of sun drop to two bottles of

475
00:27:08,340 --> 00:27:12,140
sun drop. You gets real sick. Yeah, it wasn't really nobody ever won that

476
00:27:12,140 --> 00:27:15,220
Where is, have you seen Sundrop Re, is that a discontinued?

477
00:27:15,220 --> 00:27:16,060
I don't know what that is.

478
00:27:16,060 --> 00:27:17,460
You posted something last night.

479
00:27:17,460 --> 00:27:18,300
Oh yeah.

480
00:27:18,300 --> 00:27:20,340
I've not stopped thinking about which is.

481
00:27:20,340 --> 00:27:21,180
The cacti hard seltzer.

482
00:27:21,180 --> 00:27:22,620
The cacti hard seltzer.

483
00:27:22,620 --> 00:27:24,220
What happened to the cacti hard seltzer?

484
00:27:24,220 --> 00:27:26,100
That got discontinued after Astroworld.

485
00:27:26,100 --> 00:27:27,060
Oh really?

486
00:27:27,060 --> 00:27:28,180
Yeah, but that was a good.

487
00:27:28,180 --> 00:27:29,340
They thought it was the alcohol?

488
00:27:29,340 --> 00:27:31,100
That was a good hard seltzer.

489
00:27:31,100 --> 00:27:31,940
It was really good.

490
00:27:31,940 --> 00:27:33,260
It was really, really good.

491
00:27:33,260 --> 00:27:36,580
It was seven, they, it's like the bodega

492
00:27:36,580 --> 00:27:38,180
next to my apartment pulled it out

493
00:27:38,180 --> 00:27:40,180
from the damn archives or something.

494
00:27:40,180 --> 00:27:41,260
It was sitting in the.

495
00:27:41,260 --> 00:27:42,100
A vintage.

496
00:27:42,100 --> 00:27:45,620
It was a vintage. Yeah. Here we have a cacti. They didn't even know what they were sitting

497
00:27:45,620 --> 00:27:49,100
on. I kind of wanted to go like ask them. Did you buy it? Yeah, of course I did. Did

498
00:27:49,100 --> 00:27:52,900
you sip it? I had to clean it first. I had to clean that bottle. And then you drank it?

499
00:27:52,900 --> 00:27:58,460
There was some mold on it, but I scrubbed it all off. Did it hit? Dude, it hit just

500
00:27:58,460 --> 00:28:05,740
as good. I remember that summer in 2021 where I was just like, you know, drinking every

501
00:28:05,740 --> 00:28:10,180
single like partying. Cacti time. I was partying all the time. You were on cacti time. I was

502
00:28:10,180 --> 00:28:16,420
on cat time bro. You remember that? It was like, oh, like I had like a college hibernation

503
00:28:16,420 --> 00:28:21,060
and I was like 23 years old partying like it was college all the time.

504
00:28:21,060 --> 00:28:23,860
Well you get, if you were sober for a little bit.

505
00:28:23,860 --> 00:28:24,860
That's true.

506
00:28:24,860 --> 00:28:25,860
And then when you're not sober after that.

507
00:28:25,860 --> 00:28:26,860
I was sober for six months.

508
00:28:26,860 --> 00:28:29,340
And then you're like, I gotta make up for lost time.

509
00:28:29,340 --> 00:28:33,660
Yeah. I was so boring when I was sober too. It was so fucking crazy.

510
00:28:33,660 --> 00:28:34,660
Yeah, I hate to say it man.

511
00:28:34,660 --> 00:28:35,660
Yeah.

512
00:28:35,660 --> 00:28:36,660
Yeah, you were boring.

513
00:28:36,660 --> 00:28:38,060
You weren't around. You were still in Boston.

514
00:28:38,060 --> 00:28:41,060
I didn't like it. Your head was two sizes smaller than it is right now. Yeah,

515
00:28:41,060 --> 00:28:44,860
I was sober too and I was longer than him. You were sober for longer, but you

516
00:28:44,860 --> 00:28:48,300
getting, you getting sober is kind of just like, oh, it's longer though. So

517
00:28:48,300 --> 00:28:52,220
no, like you getting sober, kind of like what is longer? So I don't know why

518
00:28:52,220 --> 00:28:55,100
we're not talking about me. We can talk about you. Yeah, we can talk about you,

519
00:28:55,100 --> 00:28:59,380
I guess. What do you want to say? What do you want to say? Well, we'll say

520
00:28:59,380 --> 00:29:02,060
anything you want about. Okay, well, let's start talking. When you were

521
00:29:02,060 --> 00:29:06,060
sober, I played a lot of fortnight. You played a lot of fortnight. How do you

522
00:29:06,060 --> 00:29:10,220
pretty much. How could you possibly play fortnight not on drugs or alcohol?

523
00:29:10,220 --> 00:29:15,180
I'd managed that's impressive. I don't know when you were sober. It was like

524
00:29:15,180 --> 00:29:18,660
everyone kind of respected it. When I was sober, it was kind of like everyone was

525
00:29:18,660 --> 00:29:22,020
waiting to like had another beer. Yeah, it felt like the doomsday clock was at

526
00:29:22,020 --> 00:29:27,940
like it was almost like midnight. Like it was almost like we would go out and I

527
00:29:27,940 --> 00:29:32,140
would like we would go to that bar and I would get like a fucking orange soda or

528
00:29:32,140 --> 00:29:33,580
something and then

529
00:29:35,860 --> 00:29:40,960
would like almost buy me a beer every time. It's funny when people are

530
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:44,100
straight edge or they used to be alcoholics or something. It's so funny

531
00:29:44,100 --> 00:29:48,120
to buy them a beer and be like, Oh, you don't want it. All right, it is mine. I

532
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:51,540
think I did that. Yeah, I did that to brace after you got to do it every time.

533
00:29:51,540 --> 00:29:55,320
Do you have to shot? You got to at least you have to test their you have to test

534
00:29:55,320 --> 00:29:59,520
their gang right? It's willpower. Yeah, if you're really good about it for six

535
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:04,020
months, it doesn't mean you will if you don't have the willpower to stay

536
00:30:04,020 --> 00:30:08,500
a straight edge in the face of a friend exactly offering you alcohol, then you

537
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:12,840
don't deserve to wear the badge. I honor that is straight edge. I one hundred

538
00:30:12,840 --> 00:30:16,780
percent agree. You should be every single person in your life is like an A

539
00:30:16,780 --> 00:30:20,540
or whatever you should be like asking for their chip should be tricking them.

540
00:30:20,540 --> 00:30:23,460
You should literally be trying to trick them water. Yeah, I know it's a normal

541
00:30:23,460 --> 00:30:27,660
seltzer and then if you can't if you can't smell it before you take a sip,

542
00:30:27,660 --> 00:30:31,780
you should be yeah exactly. If you don't have the diligence to check for the

543
00:30:32,180 --> 00:30:35,680
poison that is ruining your life and every single your touch, your touch

544
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:40,600
should remove alcohol from liquids. You should be making a cup, a liquid in the

545
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:45,220
cup disappear. It's it's it becomes yeah yeah, and if they don't break on the

546
00:30:45,220 --> 00:30:49,740
seltzer trick, you should be inviting them over and making alcoholic beef stew

547
00:30:49,740 --> 00:30:50,760
and trying to

548
00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:54,400
bring it in a hard

549
00:30:56,940 --> 00:31:00,780
I'm saying and they're two by ten. It's delicious. I'm like

550
00:31:00,780 --> 00:31:02,340
fifteen percent

551
00:31:02,340 --> 00:31:10,300
so you like it. I fucking knew it yeah. They're like alcohol poisoning. Yeah,

552
00:31:10,300 --> 00:31:15,580
fuck up is so funny. God damn they don't make edibles for beer. It was

553
00:31:15,580 --> 00:31:18,460
sitting with your your homies and watching watching a sports game,

554
00:31:18,460 --> 00:31:20,460
evaluating beef. Still yeah, so

555
00:31:20,460 --> 00:31:25,540
spilling it everywhere, causing with those shallow bowls, six bowls of

556
00:31:25,580 --> 00:31:26,580
stewage

557
00:31:26,580 --> 00:31:30,940
dying to getting up to go to the kitchen, like a way to

558
00:31:30,940 --> 00:31:34,220
you are in the kitchen just looks like so a diary

559
00:31:34,220 --> 00:31:38,420
you're trying to fucking pick up the ladle and like get it into your the

560
00:31:38,420 --> 00:31:42,660
ladle gets dropped into the still. All the potatoes have this like weird like

561
00:31:42,660 --> 00:31:45,980
foam over the imagine how amazing

562
00:31:45,980 --> 00:31:53,420
hitting the beef bong. Oh my God, how amazing is that? That would be the

563
00:31:53,460 --> 00:31:55,460
greatest Super Bowl party of all time.

564
00:31:55,460 --> 00:31:57,460
Alcoholic beef stew.

565
00:31:57,460 --> 00:31:58,460
Oh, where's the beer?

566
00:31:58,460 --> 00:31:59,460
No, the best would be chili.

567
00:31:59,460 --> 00:32:00,460
No beer, but you gotta try this.

568
00:32:00,460 --> 00:32:01,460
We don't need beer today.

569
00:32:01,460 --> 00:32:02,460
We don't need beer, man.

570
00:32:02,460 --> 00:32:05,460
We invented a beef stew with alcohol in it.

571
00:32:05,460 --> 00:32:07,460
Get some crackers, dude.

572
00:32:07,460 --> 00:32:09,460
Get some crackers, dive right in.

573
00:32:09,460 --> 00:32:10,460
Oh, that's so good.

574
00:32:10,460 --> 00:32:12,460
You made it out of crackers.

575
00:32:12,460 --> 00:32:13,460
I wanna do...

576
00:32:13,460 --> 00:32:15,460
You put any little oyster crackers in it.

577
00:32:15,460 --> 00:32:17,460
I wanna do a new...

578
00:32:17,460 --> 00:32:19,460
I wanna do a new bachelor party.

579
00:32:19,460 --> 00:32:21,460
I wanna redo a bachelor party

580
00:32:21,460 --> 00:32:26,280
party where there's no drinking alcohol and only edible alcohol, only

581
00:32:26,280 --> 00:32:31,400
alcoholic beef stew, only jello shots. Yes, I will pull up with a crock pot

582
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:34,440
full of alcoholic beef stew. You know, I will know you know, you're clear

583
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:39,000
green alcohol and it will get you so I'm not going to do any math about it

584
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:42,840
now, like coming to work and you're like you're wearing the sunglasses.

585
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:45,960
You're clearly so hung over and they're like oh you go to the bar last night.

586
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:46,800
You're like no, no,

587
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:53,000
I went to the crazy, the craziest out of my life. It's a bunch of alcoholic

588
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:57,160
beefs. Oh, there's something so funny about getting getting the drunkest

589
00:32:57,160 --> 00:33:00,540
you've ever been in your life and having to apologize and explain to people that

590
00:33:00,540 --> 00:33:01,560
yeah, so it was I

591
00:33:01,560 --> 00:33:06,960
texted you last night. Yeah, I was off the alcoholic. Yeah, Oh, what's the

592
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:08,560
crock pot? Is that a new bar

593
00:33:08,560 --> 00:33:13,320
the four AM text for you, WID

594
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:16,800
eight hours later. Sorry, bro. I had alcoholic

595
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:24,000
this the most insane excuse. Yeah, you're making it up. You're panicking.

596
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,640
Yeah, it's like when you try to yeah, you lie to your boss to tell them

597
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:29,940
you're sick to get a day off and you make up too many details. Yeah, yeah,

598
00:33:29,940 --> 00:33:34,480
my friend invented alcoholic be stew and I had a bunch of me and tell anyone

599
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:35,320
that it was spiked.

600
00:33:35,320 --> 00:33:37,600
He spiked the piece.

601
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:41,960
I would eat that man. I was really getting excited. You were saying

602
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,920
There's no alcoholic edibles.

603
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:45,280
That's what jello shots are.

604
00:33:45,280 --> 00:33:46,800
Well, yeah, but, well, okay.

605
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:50,440
So the, so the way, what I'm thinking is how you could make this alcoholic beef

606
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:55,000
stew is that it's not like, so like, you know, when they have like the,

607
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,320
the stock gelatin, you know?

608
00:33:57,320 --> 00:33:57,720
Yeah.

609
00:33:57,720 --> 00:34:00,520
So what you would do, right.

610
00:34:00,520 --> 00:34:05,200
Is you like, I dunno, I guess like reduce, uh, some kind of like beef bone or like

611
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:10,600
beef broth or whatever with maybe ever clear, or I was thinking Guinness just so

612
00:34:10,600 --> 00:34:12,960
would have that creaminess to it.

613
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:14,640
- Well, but then that's not gonna be high enough ABV.

614
00:34:14,640 --> 00:34:15,480
- No, exactly.

615
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:19,600
So it's gotta be like something that's a very, very high ABV.

616
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:20,920
Maybe like a grainy or nephew.

617
00:34:20,920 --> 00:34:25,920
- You just gotta season it enough that you can't taste it.

618
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:26,920
- Oh, mellow corn would work.

619
00:34:26,920 --> 00:34:28,360
- Mellow corn would work really well.

620
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:29,720
Some kind of clear whiskey.

621
00:34:29,720 --> 00:34:32,160
- Marinate the beef and yeah, and some.

622
00:34:32,160 --> 00:34:34,440
- The marinade would work okay.

623
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:36,240
'Cause people marinate stuff in beer all the time.

624
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:38,840
But the thing is you would have to,

625
00:34:38,840 --> 00:34:40,560
it would be really, it kind of sucks,

626
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:44,160
but you would have to make the beef stew and then in the last ten minutes you

627
00:34:44,160 --> 00:34:49,800
have to pour a gallon of alcohol. Alcohol cooks off so easily yeah, so it would

628
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:52,480
yes, it have to be it would just have to be as just you have to taste like

629
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:57,020
you have to put yeah yeah, I mean very bad yeah, which is fine. You're not

630
00:34:57,020 --> 00:35:00,240
you're yeah. You like the taste of alcohol eating for effect. Exactly

631
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:02,900
right in to get I'm eating to get drunk man. I'm not eating. I'm not getting

632
00:35:02,900 --> 00:35:04,520
someone some fruity flavored

633
00:35:07,020 --> 00:35:11,260
beef to to get fucked up eating like a bowl. You're sitting at home with a

634
00:35:11,260 --> 00:35:14,900
bowl of beef stew and then dropping a shot of whiskey in it like it's a

635
00:35:14,900 --> 00:35:16,500
boiler maker. Yeah,

636
00:35:16,500 --> 00:35:23,940
I think this is a good idea. This is a really good idea. I think yet again is

637
00:35:23,940 --> 00:35:29,780
an incredible another amazing. I was so many good food ideas on this podcast

638
00:35:29,780 --> 00:35:34,700
that it's a shame that Babish does not listen. I think that we I actually think

639
00:35:34,740 --> 00:35:37,740
but now I'm thinking that we should fully make this alcohol. We should make

640
00:35:37,740 --> 00:35:42,620
alcoholic beef stew next month for a Thanksgiving episode. Yes, I'm so

641
00:35:42,620 --> 00:35:43,060
fucking

642
00:35:43,060 --> 00:35:45,380
I'm so fucking

643
00:35:45,380 --> 00:35:50,860
we got to consult the we can just pour alcohol into the beach. I don't know. I

644
00:35:50,860 --> 00:35:54,100
wonder if we consult the chef. We want to see what you want to come up. We need

645
00:35:54,100 --> 00:35:57,060
a chef to come on the show. This is going to happen. This is coming. I made

646
00:35:57,060 --> 00:35:57,460
I

647
00:35:57,460 --> 00:36:02,820
that's actually a good idea. That is not a bad idea, but I need to get I need to

648
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:07,320
there. I fucked up off some beef stew. Yeah, fucked off beef. I'm going to get

649
00:36:07,320 --> 00:36:11,140
fucked off some beef stew, man. Okay, wait. So let's think about all the

650
00:36:11,140 --> 00:36:15,000
recipes we've created over the years, right? So we have now alcoholic beef stew

651
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:20,280
is the number one, the hot, the hot burger, right? The hot burger, Chinese

652
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:21,100
style euro.

653
00:36:21,100 --> 00:36:25,680
I do remember that. I don't know. That was the you weren't on that episode.

654
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:30,760
That was on the moneymaker symposium. It's a, you know, like a Szechuan euro,

655
00:36:31,120 --> 00:36:36,400
but what is what's the bread? What's the meat? I'm not gonna okay. The bread is a

656
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:40,080
scallion pancake and then oh my God, it's amazing. It's a really, really good.

657
00:36:40,080 --> 00:36:46,120
Great idea and it's like char siu pork. Oh, what's any sauce? No, I think I don't

658
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:49,160
know, but which is you'd have to make like a Chinese style. Siddiqui. You know

659
00:36:49,160 --> 00:36:53,160
what I like? Yum yum sauce. I love you. Could be a sauce. They don't have it at

660
00:36:53,160 --> 00:36:56,960
my grocery store. Maybe they sell it at the grocery store. Yeah, I mean, you can

661
00:36:56,960 --> 00:37:01,200
just may I make it, but I thought that was only a restaurant sauce. No, you

662
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:04,800
can buy it. You can buy it at some place. Yum yum sauce. Yeah. Holy. How

663
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:06,960
do you think the restaurants get it? Man? Isn't just man? Why are you

664
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:10,680
counting? I'm trying to remember other recipes. He's counting the three.

665
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:15,240
These are the top three right now. So it's the alcoholic beef stew. Yeah.

666
00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:16,120
Hot burger.

667
00:37:16,120 --> 00:37:20,480
Chinese style euro. I don't think we create that many recipes to be

668
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:23,920
honest. We create a good amount. Maybe you do. Yeah. I think my first ever

669
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:28,020
was yeah, I don't have ever thought of an idea for a recipe. You've thought of

670
00:37:28,020 --> 00:37:32,860
recipes on here. Like what? Name one. I'm trying to remember. I think, I think,

671
00:37:32,860 --> 00:37:36,460
with the exception of alcoholic beef stew, I think I'm the only chef on the

672
00:37:36,460 --> 00:37:38,120
show. You know what I always thought would be a good idea?

673
00:37:38,120 --> 00:37:44,640
'Cause people always like to eat either a pancake or a waffle. A poffle. How

674
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:48,520
about a pancake and then a waffle and then a pancake on top? Pan- waffle

675
00:37:48,520 --> 00:37:52,880
sandwich with pancake bread. Yes. That's a pretty decent idea. That's not so

676
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:58,080
bad an idea, but I was missing some French toast and a French toast. I meant

677
00:37:58,080 --> 00:38:01,760
you have to say and a French toast spread. If you are one of these guys that

678
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:05,000
makes spreadsheets about the types of hats that we wear and the types of

679
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:08,880
drinks that we have, if you can scrub through every single episode and find

680
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:12,800
the recipe, find all of our recipes together, a cookbook. Oh my God, book is

681
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:16,640
not a bad idea. I think we actually had an idea for a cookbook a long time ago,

682
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:20,800
but I don't remember what it was. I do remember. I remember just that that being

683
00:38:20,820 --> 00:38:24,520
green idea, but I think we've got very far a lot of cocktails to which is you

684
00:38:24,520 --> 00:38:28,260
know that's a good book and thing like the end of the book is all cocktails

685
00:38:28,260 --> 00:38:29,920
because we have had patries delight.

686
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:34,460
I'll call beef stew is probably the best transition. That is the one yeah it's

687
00:38:34,460 --> 00:38:38,060
between a cocktail and a food. So that's the one that comes before the

688
00:38:38,060 --> 00:38:42,640
whole new genre of type of thing called a food tale. We can put no or cock. Oh

689
00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:45,460
yeah, no is cock food, cock food,

690
00:38:45,460 --> 00:38:50,420
cock food, yeah, maybe we could put in a poop drink. We could put in a recipe for

691
00:38:50,460 --> 00:38:56,300
the week at plate to the week. Yeah, yeah, what one half serving of turkey one half

692
00:38:56,300 --> 00:39:00,620
serving with one roll with a bite out of it, yeah and and

693
00:39:00,620 --> 00:39:06,020
set up the plate and then eat strudel for four hours. Wait to set him up for

694
00:39:06,020 --> 00:39:09,500
another pick. I've been thinking about it. I'm such a I'm so not going to frame

695
00:39:09,500 --> 00:39:12,660
him. I can't make Thanksgiving this year. I've been thinking why not it's my

696
00:39:12,660 --> 00:39:16,020
nephew's birthday. So I actually I haven't seen my brother's birthday. I

697
00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:21,020
I haven't seen my family in like five months. Probably I have I got to go home

698
00:39:21,020 --> 00:39:24,540
for one of the holidays. Who cares about your family, man? Yeah, it's a good

699
00:39:24,540 --> 00:39:27,780
point. They're going to go home for Christmas anyway. Yeah, Thanksgiving is

700
00:39:27,780 --> 00:39:30,700
about friends. Thanksgiving is about the people. That's true. Thanksgiving

701
00:39:30,700 --> 00:39:35,820
Thanksgiving is about the Native Americans becoming very good friends with

702
00:39:35,820 --> 00:39:39,100
the pilgrims. I used to hate Thanksgiving when I lived at home and

703
00:39:39,100 --> 00:39:43,260
then I moved to Boston, started doing it at my house and I was like, it's magic.

704
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:48,040
this is the best felt completely magical last year. I get to I want to tell you

705
00:39:48,040 --> 00:39:53,120
guys something right now. I'm on a ham break because I'm so excited to have

706
00:39:53,120 --> 00:39:57,400
some ham with everybody. I've been taking a ham break for a few weeks now.

707
00:39:57,400 --> 00:40:02,720
Wow, you usually eat a lot of ham, not a lot, but I do I do eat it. I mean I

708
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:07,920
have it in sandwiches. Yeah, I really only eat it at Thanksgiving. Yeah, I'm

709
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:11,480
not eating like you know a glazed. I would like to eat a glazed ham, but it's

710
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:15,140
coming. It's coming. That's what I can't. I've been literally I'm not even

711
00:40:15,140 --> 00:40:18,120
kidding and Julio can attest to this, because I think I've probably talked to

712
00:40:18,120 --> 00:40:21,440
him about this a lot, but I've been thinking about ham since last

713
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:25,800
Thanksgiving. I want to know I need I need that ham ham on the on the Hawaiian

714
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:26,120
roll.

715
00:40:26,120 --> 00:40:30,900
My God, I'm so jealous of you guys right now. I'm so bummed. I can't Jack was

716
00:40:30,900 --> 00:40:35,620
showing me pictures of his Thanksgiving last night. Yeah, and he has the most

717
00:40:35,620 --> 00:40:40,020
fucked up Thanksgiving food at his family's house. It's like yeah, they'll

718
00:40:40,040 --> 00:40:43,800
of mac and cheese and he showed me that he showed me that he's the only person

719
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:48,100
who eats a single bite of it. They just make it every year and like box stuffing

720
00:40:48,100 --> 00:40:52,340
and like a turkey with no nothing on it. They just put the turkey in the oven

721
00:40:52,340 --> 00:40:56,000
just let it just cook for 10 hours. They're not even putting butter under the skin? You

722
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:59,220
gotta put the butter under the skin. You gotta put the butter under the skin. I'm buying...

723
00:40:59,220 --> 00:41:06,300
I'm finally gonna make a turkey this year too. You're gonna miss on my first turkey.

724
00:41:06,300 --> 00:41:07,140
- Oh!

725
00:41:07,140 --> 00:41:08,300
- And I have a sage butter that I'm gonna be

726
00:41:08,300 --> 00:41:09,740
- Fuck my life, dude. - Involving into it.

727
00:41:09,740 --> 00:41:11,100
- Fuck my fucking life.

728
00:41:11,100 --> 00:41:12,580
I'm missing Friendsgiving.

729
00:41:12,580 --> 00:41:14,380
- And Noah might be making some cocktails,

730
00:41:14,380 --> 00:41:15,220
some batch cocktails.

731
00:41:15,220 --> 00:41:18,060
- I literally, I was so excited to make

732
00:41:18,060 --> 00:41:19,780
like the Brussels sprouts again.

733
00:41:19,780 --> 00:41:20,660
- Those are good, man.

734
00:41:20,660 --> 00:41:21,500
- I know.

735
00:41:21,500 --> 00:41:22,580
- You need to triple the recipe though.

736
00:41:22,580 --> 00:41:23,420
- Yeah.

737
00:41:23,420 --> 00:41:24,240
- We're gonna have a big Thanksgiving this year.

738
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:27,020
- I showed up with a little bit too little food.

739
00:41:27,020 --> 00:41:28,460
- Yeah, you showed up with the weakest,

740
00:41:28,460 --> 00:41:31,220
the weakest Friendsgiving pan.

741
00:41:31,220 --> 00:41:34,060
- But the little that was there was very well cooked.

742
00:41:34,060 --> 00:41:35,060
- It was very good.

743
00:41:35,060 --> 00:41:37,980
And my girlfriend made those sage butter biscuits.

744
00:41:37,980 --> 00:41:38,820
- Those were good as well.

745
00:41:38,820 --> 00:41:42,420
- Those were so, she's fuckin', she's cracked at baking stuff.

746
00:41:42,420 --> 00:41:43,260
- You got it like that.

747
00:41:43,260 --> 00:41:44,700
- She do got it like that.

748
00:41:44,700 --> 00:41:45,540
- I'm really--

749
00:41:45,540 --> 00:41:47,460
- Do you remember, did you have those,

750
00:41:47,460 --> 00:41:48,500
what was that shit she made?

751
00:41:48,500 --> 00:41:49,540
Oh, I don't know if you had it,

752
00:41:49,540 --> 00:41:52,740
but she made these white miso cookies

753
00:41:52,740 --> 00:41:56,700
that were kinda like gingerbread cookies,

754
00:41:56,700 --> 00:41:58,180
but not gingerbread cookies.

755
00:41:58,180 --> 00:41:59,660
- That's a little too weird for me.

756
00:41:59,660 --> 00:42:00,980
- But you think it's a little too weird,

757
00:42:00,980 --> 00:42:02,180
then you take your first bite out of it,

758
00:42:02,180 --> 00:42:03,940
and you're like, holy shit.

759
00:42:03,940 --> 00:42:08,100
I don't even, isn't miso like a soybean, fermented soybean or something?

760
00:42:08,100 --> 00:42:11,500
She fully did, she fully went off with it.

761
00:42:11,500 --> 00:42:12,500
Popped.

762
00:42:12,500 --> 00:42:13,500
Uh huh.

763
00:42:13,500 --> 00:42:14,500
She popped the fuck off.

764
00:42:14,500 --> 00:42:17,980
And we're all, and even if I do come to Friendsgiving, we're all going to miss out because she's

765
00:42:17,980 --> 00:42:18,980
going home.

766
00:42:18,980 --> 00:42:21,540
She's going up to, she's going upstate.

767
00:42:21,540 --> 00:42:24,300
Maybe I'll have Noah make the, maybe I'll have Noah make the poop drink.

768
00:42:24,300 --> 00:42:25,300
The poop drink.

769
00:42:25,300 --> 00:42:26,300
Last Thanksgiving.

770
00:42:26,300 --> 00:42:27,300
If I miss out on the fucking poop drink, I will kill myself.

771
00:42:27,300 --> 00:42:28,300
You know what you're going to miss out on?

772
00:42:28,300 --> 00:42:29,300
I will fucking kill myself.

773
00:42:29,300 --> 00:42:30,300
You know what you're going to miss out on?

774
00:42:30,300 --> 00:42:31,300
What?

775
00:42:31,300 --> 00:42:34,700
last year for Thanksgiving, I have you guys remember I made some mashed

776
00:42:34,700 --> 00:42:37,380
potatoes that weren't necessary and nobody ate a single bite of something.

777
00:42:37,380 --> 00:42:41,100
I might do that again. Yeah, no, I come up with mash. Did I pull up with

778
00:42:41,100 --> 00:42:46,300
mashed potatoes? You come up with that? No, did I pull up with mashed potato?

779
00:42:46,300 --> 00:42:50,340
What did I? I had the roasted veggies. I brought the mashed potatoes and they

780
00:42:50,340 --> 00:42:54,260
were unnecessary. Then my girlfriend brought those those sage butter biscuits

781
00:42:54,260 --> 00:42:56,340
and then some other things, some other pastry.

782
00:42:57,740 --> 00:43:00,540
I'm on ham duty, chipotle mac and cheese, and green beans.

783
00:43:00,540 --> 00:43:01,040
Mm-hmm.

784
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:01,840
That's what I make.

785
00:43:01,840 --> 00:43:03,200
Maybe I'll get a pie or something.

786
00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:05,640
And this year, man, I'm making a turkey.

787
00:43:05,640 --> 00:43:06,480
I just told Patrick.

788
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:07,440
Can I bring something?

789
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:07,940
Yes.

790
00:43:07,940 --> 00:43:08,520
Oh, yeah.

791
00:43:08,520 --> 00:43:09,520
Leo's going to be there.

792
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:10,280
Gordita.

793
00:43:10,280 --> 00:43:12,520
Yeah, please bring some traditional--

794
00:43:12,520 --> 00:43:15,360
last year, not to Thanksgiving, but last year you came

795
00:43:15,360 --> 00:43:17,360
and visited and you brought--

796
00:43:17,360 --> 00:43:17,880
Oh, my god.

797
00:43:17,880 --> 00:43:19,160
--a bunch of Mexican candy.

798
00:43:19,160 --> 00:43:20,000
Those little--

799
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:20,500
That was--

800
00:43:20,500 --> 00:43:21,280
--the Nutcrunchers.

801
00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:22,640
And it was so disgusting, man.

802
00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:24,080
No, half of it was good.

803
00:43:24,080 --> 00:43:26,560
Half of it was good, because it was caramel.

804
00:43:26,560 --> 00:43:29,700
and then the rest of it was so just unruly.

805
00:43:29,700 --> 00:43:34,280
Those... I'm gonna bring empanadas. Okay. I'll eat empanadas.

806
00:43:34,280 --> 00:43:39,000
I'll eat some empanadas. Like a dessert. Yeah, like a...

807
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:42,840
Caramel apple kinda thing? That would be good.

808
00:43:42,840 --> 00:43:47,640
You'll see. Okay. I wish I was seeing this.

809
00:43:47,640 --> 00:43:51,720
Why are you not... Oh, 'cause you're gonna be in... I'm probably gonna be

810
00:43:51,720 --> 00:43:55,160
in New Hampshire, yeah. But if I'm not, just say you're sick,

811
00:43:55,160 --> 00:44:01,800
man. I could fake COVID. Just fake COVID. Sorry mom. Although I think that excuse is kind

812
00:44:01,800 --> 00:44:06,920
of running dry. That excuse is running dry. You can kind of just, especially in my family.

813
00:44:06,920 --> 00:44:13,680
Last year when I was pulling up for Christmas, or no this was two years ago, so it was when

814
00:44:13,680 --> 00:44:21,760
it was very bad. My family jumped the, that excuse became very dry. Yeah, very quick.

815
00:44:21,760 --> 00:44:25,040
two years ago, my dad was picking me up.

816
00:44:25,040 --> 00:44:28,680
Or no, my dad was here on business and then was like,

817
00:44:28,680 --> 00:44:33,040
"Oh yeah, you guys are gonna drive home for Christmas or whatever.

818
00:44:33,040 --> 00:44:37,240
Yeah, I'm just worried about your younger brother's COVID."

819
00:44:37,240 --> 00:44:38,880
And I was like, "What?"

820
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:41,400
She was like, "Oh yeah, your younger brother had COVID."

821
00:44:41,400 --> 00:44:43,640
I was like, "Did you see him like recently?"

822
00:44:43,640 --> 00:44:45,640
They were like, "Yeah, we saw him last week."

823
00:44:45,640 --> 00:44:47,840
We were just around him.

824
00:44:47,840 --> 00:44:50,520
I was like, "Oh, Jesus Christ."

825
00:44:50,520 --> 00:44:53,400
Well this was like two years ago when it mattered.

826
00:44:53,400 --> 00:44:59,480
This is like, they were telling me, they were telling me, they were telling me like you

827
00:44:59,480 --> 00:45:02,120
know how freaked out I was about it for like a year?

828
00:45:02,120 --> 00:45:06,640
And they were telling me that like at the tail end of me like really being scared of

829
00:45:06,640 --> 00:45:08,000
it.

830
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:11,280
And I was like oh my god is he, I don't think he's vaccinated.

831
00:45:11,280 --> 00:45:13,920
I thought he was going to die.

832
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:15,360
I don't know why I brought this up.

833
00:45:15,360 --> 00:45:17,280
No, no it's good.

834
00:45:17,280 --> 00:45:18,280
Okay the poop drink is.

835
00:45:18,280 --> 00:45:19,280
It's not good.

836
00:45:19,280 --> 00:45:23,540
let's talk about the food. The poop drink is as far if I remember it's basically a

837
00:45:23,540 --> 00:45:31,560
Sazerac with Sherry Sherry wine, a brown wine and some kind of syrup, but it's

838
00:45:31,560 --> 00:45:35,860
like a foam right well and then at the top, so it's a completely brown drink and

839
00:45:35,860 --> 00:45:40,780
then at the top it's served in a like a gimlet glass toilet it's served oh yeah

840
00:45:40,780 --> 00:45:43,340
it's supposed to be served in a toilet yeah it's served in a some kind of

841
00:45:43,340 --> 00:45:49,220
toilet glass yeah a prank glass like a parrot drink yeah yeah and then at the

842
00:45:49,220 --> 00:45:54,220
top it's a pistachio foam yeah. So it's green, so it's green at the green poop

843
00:45:54,220 --> 00:45:54,900
on yeah,

844
00:45:54,900 --> 00:45:56,760
I thought it was like

845
00:45:56,760 --> 00:45:59,300
well, you know, like gold flake on it.

846
00:45:59,300 --> 00:46:03,900
That would be a good idea. Why not just put some corn kernels? Yeah, you can

847
00:46:03,900 --> 00:46:08,500
just put corn on it like a sweet corn and one of those really a couple of

848
00:46:08,500 --> 00:46:12,900
really dark and hell throw some poop in there to put a couple of turds in it

849
00:46:12,900 --> 00:46:15,900
throw some poop up. Who gives a fuck? It's already called a poop drink is

850
00:46:15,940 --> 00:46:21,220
it in a fucking toilet. Just make it taste like shit. We talked about poop at the eating poop

851
00:46:21,220 --> 00:46:28,580
at the bar for an hour the other night. It was me, Leo, Corey, and then Shreider and like a bunch of

852
00:46:28,580 --> 00:46:32,900
other people. And then I got a text from Corey. You were like, are you guys still there? Yeah.

853
00:46:32,900 --> 00:46:36,580
And he was like, yeah, we're all here and we're talking. We've been talking about eating poop

854
00:46:36,580 --> 00:46:43,620
for one hour. I was like, okay. And then I got stuck in the conversation. I kept trying to get

855
00:46:43,620 --> 00:46:47,040
get out of the conversation to when you got there, we were fully out of the

856
00:46:47,040 --> 00:46:51,440
conversation and then you know I had to bring it back. It fully looped back. You

857
00:46:51,440 --> 00:46:54,700
know I had to bring it back eating poop last night. I told her I just remember

858
00:46:54,700 --> 00:46:58,380
this the like a month ago, Pierce made a bunch of girls leave a bar because he

859
00:46:58,380 --> 00:47:01,980
was talking about a penis being mutilated. Oh really, I was talking about

860
00:47:01,980 --> 00:47:04,460
it really loudly. I forgot what he was even to he's saying something about

861
00:47:04,460 --> 00:47:09,580
something going up as the urethra and a bunch of girls in the outside bar area

862
00:47:09,580 --> 00:47:13,060
and they all stood up and left. I think about that sometimes if you put

863
00:47:13,100 --> 00:47:15,700
something too big. He was talking about something specific. I can't remember

864
00:47:15,700 --> 00:47:19,260
what it was, but it was so funny. He was and you can imagine him talking about it

865
00:47:19,260 --> 00:47:23,180
really loudly and it was just yeah and it was and then a bunch of people left.

866
00:47:23,180 --> 00:47:28,840
Oh my God, I did it. Were you trying to get seats? No, no, these poor people just

867
00:47:28,840 --> 00:47:33,160
didn't want to hear. I mean there was yeah hearing peers say about this cock

868
00:47:33,160 --> 00:47:37,240
yeah in your cock banana peeled back and it looks like it looks like an elite

869
00:47:37,260 --> 00:47:38,420
my mouth from a low

870
00:47:38,420 --> 00:47:40,260
manner puss

871
00:47:40,260 --> 00:47:43,560
manner

872
00:47:43,560 --> 00:47:49,460
you remember nanner puss. No, you don't remember nanner puss. What is that

873
00:47:49,460 --> 00:47:50,260
now?

874
00:47:50,260 --> 00:47:57,160
Name for Denny's, I think so yeah, one of those types of nanner puss was one of

875
00:47:57,160 --> 00:47:58,860
the biggest Super Bowl commercials.

876
00:47:58,860 --> 00:48:01,360
Oh my God,

877
00:48:01,360 --> 00:48:07,060
yeah, that's what you want to do to the meme that never was. What do they mean by

878
00:48:07,060 --> 00:48:10,660
that it was a meme man. Everyone's but they're saying they're saying it's the

879
00:48:10,660 --> 00:48:14,900
meme that never was and this is what I mean and it was apparently a cursed

880
00:48:14,900 --> 00:48:17,860
commercial. According to the cursed commercials wiki, a little bit of a

881
00:48:17,860 --> 00:48:21,620
biased source. Well, anyway, but yeah, that's a penis. Good. That could happen

882
00:48:21,620 --> 00:48:26,500
to one of those. What are you guys going to go as for Halloween? I could have so

883
00:48:26,500 --> 00:48:30,060
many decisions. My girlfriend was going to be Lila and I was going to be Fry.

884
00:48:30,060 --> 00:48:34,660
Yeah, I was my girlfriend being Billy from Saw the Puppet. So I think maybe I

885
00:48:34,700 --> 00:48:38,140
might kind of phone it in and be to the guy and saw us to cut his leg off and

886
00:48:38,140 --> 00:48:40,880
just wear a shirt with blood on it and can't have a saw. But I don't yeah

887
00:48:40,880 --> 00:48:44,260
because there's no other there's no identifiable characters in the soft

888
00:48:44,260 --> 00:48:47,640
franchise except for the puppet. That's really it. I think this is the year

889
00:48:47,640 --> 00:48:48,980
that I go all in

890
00:48:48,980 --> 00:48:53,780
and I finally become a bumblebee. I was thinking of being a mouse, but I was

891
00:48:53,780 --> 00:48:58,340
already a cat before you already were a cat and I was a beer last year. So this

892
00:48:58,340 --> 00:49:01,820
year, this is the first year in a while. I haven't had a I haven't had an idea

893
00:49:01,860 --> 00:49:07,220
about it locked in costume idea. Yeah, I could still be fry. I have the

894
00:49:07,220 --> 00:49:11,320
really don't look anything like figure, but I put that I put that orange wig on

895
00:49:11,320 --> 00:49:11,940
over there and I

896
00:49:11,940 --> 00:49:18,240
take my money. I could put makeup over it. Make up over your mustache. It would

897
00:49:18,240 --> 00:49:19,180
look so disgusting.

898
00:49:19,180 --> 00:49:25,180
Like Henry Cavill, Cesar Romero and the Joker. No, I don't think that's going to

899
00:49:25,180 --> 00:49:30,580
work man. You could be he had a flat mustache. Yeah, mine is pretty bushy.

900
00:49:30,940 --> 00:49:35,500
Yeah, it's not going to work for you. Yeah. Maybe I will be a maybe I just go

901
00:49:35,500 --> 00:49:40,180
as Dracula today. A really pretty girl. Yeah, either would be a mouse or a bug

902
00:49:40,180 --> 00:49:44,060
likely. I thought you were going to be you were going to be a character from

903
00:49:44,060 --> 00:49:45,060
persona.

904
00:49:45,060 --> 00:49:47,140
Oh yeah, it's going to be you

905
00:49:47,140 --> 00:49:53,620
me. No, his name's you. Why you me? Me? Nara Kamei from his name's camera. What

906
00:49:53,620 --> 00:50:00,060
are you calling me? You know, recalling from from persona four and I found a

907
00:50:00,180 --> 00:50:03,620
costume for it, but it's three hundred dollars. Oh, it's probably not going to

908
00:50:03,620 --> 00:50:07,420
do that. If we wear it on the episode, we can put on the company card. I don't

909
00:50:07,420 --> 00:50:11,180
think you would be that happy about subsidizing my Halloween costume. If you,

910
00:50:11,180 --> 00:50:12,820
if I could see you dress like this,

911
00:50:12,820 --> 00:50:17,420
does it be pretty nice to see you dressed? I think that I would, I think I

912
00:50:17,420 --> 00:50:21,800
would body this outfit. You're, you're, you're, I think you can just go buy a

913
00:50:21,800 --> 00:50:24,780
granny wig and then I don't think that this cost you got to, you got to, you

914
00:50:24,780 --> 00:50:27,980
got to slim your legs down a little bit for this one, though. I don't think that

915
00:50:28,020 --> 00:50:32,060
this costume is that hard to make it all you from persona for what are you

916
00:50:32,060 --> 00:50:37,340
calling me not? No, I'm not. This is he said fat you implying you're not fat.

917
00:50:37,340 --> 00:50:44,420
I would be fat you right yeah, okay, you should be fat bastard from Austin

918
00:50:44,420 --> 00:50:47,900
powers, not so fat. You should be you should be actually should be teddy from

919
00:50:47,900 --> 00:50:52,180
persona. Now that's an expensive ass costume. Go look that look that up show

920
00:50:52,180 --> 00:50:56,540
Patrick teddy from persona and then this tell me that tell me this would not be

921
00:50:56,580 --> 00:50:59,340
one was beautiful and I don't care perfect costume for Caleb.

922
00:50:59,340 --> 00:51:01,940
Well, it's actually T D D. I

923
00:51:01,940 --> 00:51:07,140
the human form go search human at human. No, no, no, this is already. This is a

924
00:51:07,140 --> 00:51:11,620
really good one. You am you am the look of the first one. Oh my God, I would I

925
00:51:11,620 --> 00:51:12,820
could do that actually. Yeah,

926
00:51:12,820 --> 00:51:14,300
yeah,

927
00:51:14,300 --> 00:51:20,420
all right, all right, I'm gonna do this. I'm gonna be a little boy with shocking

928
00:51:20,420 --> 00:51:26,260
blue eyes and a blouse and a rose and a blonde hair. I think that actually now

929
00:51:26,300 --> 00:51:31,860
I'm thinking about costume stuff, I think that one of us should be Bad Luck Brian.

930
00:51:31,860 --> 00:51:33,860
It's going to be you.

931
00:51:33,860 --> 00:51:34,860
Bad Luck Brian?

932
00:51:34,860 --> 00:51:36,300
That would be dope.

933
00:51:36,300 --> 00:51:38,060
My favorite meme, man.

934
00:51:38,060 --> 00:51:41,300
Bad Luck Brian or Dramatic Chipmunk or maybe Numa Numa Guy.

935
00:51:41,300 --> 00:51:43,060
That's a good idea.

936
00:51:43,060 --> 00:51:44,060
I told…

937
00:51:44,060 --> 00:51:47,020
Do you see, three months ago, Numa Numa 2023 dropped.

938
00:51:47,020 --> 00:51:48,020
Really?

939
00:51:48,020 --> 00:51:49,020
Yeah.

940
00:51:49,020 --> 00:51:50,020
I haven't even heard about it.

941
00:51:50,020 --> 00:51:51,020
New Numa 2?

942
00:51:51,020 --> 00:51:52,020
Not even New Numa 2.

943
00:51:52,020 --> 00:51:56,220
New Numa, Numa, Numa 2023 Remaster.

944
00:51:56,220 --> 00:51:58,140
He just redid the original?

945
00:51:58,140 --> 00:52:00,620
Just filmed himself in his original bedroom.

946
00:52:00,620 --> 00:52:01,980
Gary Brausman?

947
00:52:01,980 --> 00:52:05,580
Gary Brausman is doing Numa Numa 2023.

948
00:52:05,580 --> 00:52:06,580
He refilmed it?

949
00:52:06,580 --> 00:52:07,580
He refilmed it.

950
00:52:07,580 --> 00:52:08,580
And he called it a remaster?

951
00:52:08,580 --> 00:52:10,940
I think he re-recorded the song.

952
00:52:10,940 --> 00:52:13,660
He re-recorded the song.

953
00:52:13,660 --> 00:52:18,980
You know what I think the plan was there is that he recorded the song, his vocals, made

954
00:52:18,980 --> 00:52:25,420
the video again because the original one Dragosta Dente, already a song, so he did a cover so

955
00:52:25,420 --> 00:52:27,980
that he could mint it at his NFT or something.

956
00:52:27,980 --> 00:52:29,060
- You can either-- - Okay.

957
00:52:29,060 --> 00:52:31,460
- That's my theory. - If you are going to do

958
00:52:31,460 --> 00:52:35,900
a video like that, you can either be Numa guy

959
00:52:35,900 --> 00:52:37,420
or you can be Star Wars kid.

960
00:52:37,420 --> 00:52:39,300
- Yeah. - Those are the two options.

961
00:52:39,300 --> 00:52:41,160
You can either hate, you can run away from it

962
00:52:41,160 --> 00:52:42,860
like Star Wars kid has.

963
00:52:42,860 --> 00:52:44,940
Star Wars kid-- - Create a law.

964
00:52:44,940 --> 00:52:46,900
- Star Wars kid, we need you back, man.

965
00:52:46,900 --> 00:52:50,140
- He has a crazy real name.

966
00:52:50,140 --> 00:52:51,060
- Star Wars.

967
00:52:51,060 --> 00:52:52,380
Star Wars kid. - Luke Skywalker.

968
00:52:52,380 --> 00:52:59,660
his name is like I think he was like a Finnish child or something. I thought he was American.

969
00:52:59,660 --> 00:53:03,140
Well I think he has a crazy name for an American then. I just don't remember his name. Can

970
00:53:03,140 --> 00:53:09,920
you look this up Julio? Star Wars Kid real name? Because it is honestly it sounds like

971
00:53:09,920 --> 00:53:15,340
a Star Wars name. I think you should name your child Anakin. Whoa! Yeah. Whoa. Ghislaine

972
00:53:15,340 --> 00:53:21,500
Raza. This is he has a Star Wars name. Oh my God and now he's doing a he see he's breaking

973
00:53:21,500 --> 00:53:25,700
breaking his silence. If you make an amazing YouTube video and then twenty

974
00:53:25,700 --> 00:53:29,400
years later, you have to break your silence about it and he looks like that.

975
00:53:29,400 --> 00:53:30,220
Come on, man.

976
00:53:30,220 --> 00:53:36,800
Come on, man. You're making a documentary about how I think I just found my

977
00:53:36,800 --> 00:53:37,320
Halloween

978
00:53:37,320 --> 00:53:44,020
that would actually you would you would buy that

979
00:53:44,020 --> 00:53:50,420
the Star Wars kid, but I'm the Star Wars kid now. Yeah, it's Star Wars kid

980
00:53:50,460 --> 00:53:51,620
alternate star. What I

981
00:53:51,620 --> 00:53:52,020
mean,

982
00:53:52,020 --> 00:53:53,520
I look like a face up of me.

983
00:53:53,520 --> 00:53:54,660
Yeah, it really does. That

984
00:53:54,660 --> 00:53:56,820
looks like when I'm doing the

985
00:53:56,820 --> 00:53:58,820
face at whoa fire in the

986
00:53:58,820 --> 00:54:00,020
neighborhood. No, probably

987
00:54:00,020 --> 00:54:02,860
not. His his fucking glasses

988
00:54:02,860 --> 00:54:04,020
look like the belt on a

989
00:54:04,020 --> 00:54:05,380
cartoon character works at

990
00:54:05,380 --> 00:54:06,860
the circus. This is what

991
00:54:06,860 --> 00:54:07,820
look at that. This is what

992
00:54:07,820 --> 00:54:09,020
really made a lawsuit

993
00:54:09,020 --> 00:54:10,820
against. He made a lawsuit

994
00:54:10,820 --> 00:54:12,460
against bullying him online.

995
00:54:12,460 --> 00:54:15,100
Yeah, yeah, and how is it?

996
00:54:15,100 --> 00:54:16,460
No, dude, it's not bullying.

997
00:54:16,460 --> 00:54:18,620
I'm not saying on fact the

998
00:54:18,620 --> 00:54:20,220
original. Okay, I should be

999
00:54:20,220 --> 00:54:23,920
bullied now when the video came out, nobody was no and then that video was

1000
00:54:23,920 --> 00:54:27,620
fucking cool. It was bad ass. Yeah, that's what I'm saying. He looked dope.

1001
00:54:27,620 --> 00:54:30,300
It's smart of him to when he has such a

1002
00:54:30,300 --> 00:54:36,100
big circular head. It's actually very clever to have a small circle of facial

1003
00:54:36,100 --> 00:54:37,620
hair going on. That's not him.

1004
00:54:37,620 --> 00:54:42,460
That's not him. Wait, unrecognizable. It says unrecognizable. Is that

1005
00:54:42,460 --> 00:54:47,540
is this a different guy? Star Wars kid, the rise of the digital shadow.

1006
00:54:47,940 --> 00:54:49,940
What the fuck is this?

1007
00:54:49,940 --> 00:54:51,940
It's a documentary about him, man.

1008
00:54:51,940 --> 00:54:53,940
See, look, everyone made him look dope. They gave him real lightsabers.

1009
00:54:53,940 --> 00:54:55,940
I just don't understand

1010
00:54:55,940 --> 00:54:57,940
why this was ever a problem.

1011
00:54:57,940 --> 00:54:59,940
Yeah.

1012
00:54:59,940 --> 00:55:01,940
He was so fucking cool that people couldn't

1013
00:55:01,940 --> 00:55:03,940
They couldn't fathom it.

1014
00:55:03,940 --> 00:55:05,940
They couldn't fathom it. No.

1015
00:55:05,940 --> 00:55:07,940
And now he's a humongously giant guy.

1016
00:55:07,940 --> 00:55:09,940
Al's toy barn and shit.

1017
00:55:09,940 --> 00:55:13,940
He does look just like that guy.

1018
00:55:13,940 --> 00:55:15,940
He lived long enough to see himself become a villain.

1019
00:55:15,940 --> 00:55:19,820
He used to be cool, but when he complained about all that stuff, it turned him into a

1020
00:55:19,820 --> 00:55:20,820
male Karen.

1021
00:55:20,820 --> 00:55:21,820
I agree, man.

1022
00:55:21,820 --> 00:55:23,380
And this is what a male Karen usually looks like.

1023
00:55:23,380 --> 00:55:24,380
This is a male Karen physiognomy.

1024
00:55:24,380 --> 00:55:27,180
What you're supposed to do with bullying is you're supposed to say...

1025
00:55:27,180 --> 00:55:28,700
I know you are, but what am I?

1026
00:55:28,700 --> 00:55:29,700
Just a hard rubber in your heel.

1027
00:55:29,700 --> 00:55:30,700
Just a hard rubber in your heel.

1028
00:55:30,700 --> 00:55:31,700
Slap him.

1029
00:55:31,700 --> 00:55:32,700
Exactly, bro.

1030
00:55:32,700 --> 00:55:34,900
And I'm not fucking with nobody who can swing a lightsaber like that.

1031
00:55:34,900 --> 00:55:35,900
Straight up.

1032
00:55:35,900 --> 00:55:36,900
No, no.

1033
00:55:36,900 --> 00:55:37,900
That's proof it wasn't bullying.

1034
00:55:37,900 --> 00:55:38,900
Would you bully a guy with a lightsaber?

1035
00:55:38,900 --> 00:55:39,900
No.

1036
00:55:39,900 --> 00:55:40,900
Hell no.

1037
00:55:40,900 --> 00:55:43,180
No, you'd bully the guy like, you know...

1038
00:55:43,180 --> 00:55:44,500
He'll chop your legs off.

1039
00:55:44,500 --> 00:55:46,600
You bully a guy that is no threat to you.

1040
00:55:46,600 --> 00:55:49,000
Yeah. And that's a bad way to go, lightsaber.

1041
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:50,800
You get chopped in half, you stay alive.

1042
00:55:50,800 --> 00:55:54,000
If I was, I'd be like, "Oh, what a nice necklace, Hasan Piker."

1043
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:56,100
Like, I'd say stuff like that.

1044
00:55:56,100 --> 00:55:58,800
And that's calling me cool because he's so cool.

1045
00:55:58,800 --> 00:56:01,100
Yeah, that's a compliment, actually.

1046
00:56:01,100 --> 00:56:03,500
Yeah.

1047
00:56:03,500 --> 00:56:08,800
By the way, that's a little bit of a glass house calling me Hasan Piker.

1048
00:56:08,800 --> 00:56:11,000
Why'd you put this pearl necklace on?

1049
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:13,400
Because it was sitting on the table, so I put on a pearl necklace

1050
00:56:13,400 --> 00:56:17,460
and you're just now noticing it looks so at home on my on my I saw it's a

1051
00:56:17,460 --> 00:56:22,100
whole time. I didn't even think about it in the in the monitor here. It looks

1052
00:56:22,100 --> 00:56:26,700
like you're wearing a necklace of bones. That's what I was hoping for. It looks

1053
00:56:26,700 --> 00:56:31,540
like all the knuckles of every enemy that I've ever killed. If you were doing

1054
00:56:31,540 --> 00:56:35,660
that, I think also I think making a necklace of knuckles is that's a little

1055
00:56:35,660 --> 00:56:39,920
bit that's a little not fair because you know you make a necklace of of ears or

1056
00:56:39,920 --> 00:56:42,620
whatever it's okay. That's only two years per person you kill you make a

1057
00:56:42,640 --> 00:56:46,060
a necklace and knuckles, you get like fucking 20 knuckles on every person.

1058
00:56:46,060 --> 00:56:47,360
Right? You can't even tell.

1059
00:56:47,360 --> 00:56:49,640
Unless you get all their middle fingers.

1060
00:56:49,640 --> 00:56:51,240
Unless you get a full necklace. Yeah, it's got to be...

1061
00:56:51,240 --> 00:56:52,280
It's got to be one finger.

1062
00:56:52,280 --> 00:56:53,840
People have too many knuckles.

1063
00:56:53,840 --> 00:56:55,480
Yeah. Ears make sense.

1064
00:56:55,480 --> 00:56:56,120
Ears is good.

1065
00:56:56,120 --> 00:56:56,520
Uh-huh.

1066
00:56:56,520 --> 00:56:57,160
Do you think if us three...

1067
00:56:57,160 --> 00:56:57,840
Noses.

1068
00:56:57,840 --> 00:56:58,800
Noses is scary.

1069
00:56:58,800 --> 00:56:59,880
Well, you've got one nose.

1070
00:56:59,880 --> 00:57:00,360
Yeah.

1071
00:57:00,360 --> 00:57:04,720
Do you think if us three discovered a dead body, it would change us as a trio?

1072
00:57:04,720 --> 00:57:05,440
Yeah.

1073
00:57:05,440 --> 00:57:06,560
No.

1074
00:57:06,560 --> 00:57:11,240
I think that it would change me. I'm very susceptible to...

1075
00:57:11,240 --> 00:57:14,680
If I saw a dead body, I'd probably walk by and pretend I didn't see it.

1076
00:57:14,680 --> 00:57:16,280
I think I would too.

1077
00:57:16,280 --> 00:57:19,520
I would see it and I would make too big of a deal about it.

1078
00:57:19,520 --> 00:57:21,720
You'd be like, "Oh, I saw a dead guy."

1079
00:57:21,720 --> 00:57:25,440
I would say maybe months later, "And you know, when I saw that dead body..."

1080
00:57:25,440 --> 00:57:28,440
And it would...

1081
00:57:28,440 --> 00:57:31,320
I mean, what would you do?

1082
00:57:31,320 --> 00:57:34,040
I would just talk about it all the time.

1083
00:57:34,040 --> 00:57:35,040
You know what I mean?

1084
00:57:35,040 --> 00:57:39,720
I'd say something and then be like, "Yeah, it's like that time that I saw the dead body."

1085
00:57:39,720 --> 00:57:41,200
You would use it as an excuse.

1086
00:57:41,200 --> 00:57:42,200
Yeah?

1087
00:57:42,200 --> 00:57:43,200
Yeah, you would use it as an excuse.

1088
00:57:43,200 --> 00:57:44,200
How?

1089
00:57:44,200 --> 00:57:48,400
You would do something, you would like go up at an open mic and just tank and then be like

1090
00:57:48,400 --> 00:57:49,400
yeah.

1091
00:57:49,400 --> 00:57:50,400
I saw a dead body earlier.

1092
00:57:50,400 --> 00:57:52,720
Well, I hope you guys know I saw a dead body four months ago.

1093
00:57:52,720 --> 00:57:55,200
I've been stressed about this.

1094
00:57:55,200 --> 00:57:56,600
That's really all I can think about.

1095
00:57:56,600 --> 00:57:59,880
Every time I look out I imagine all of you is this guy's a dead body.

1096
00:57:59,880 --> 00:58:05,400
Speaking of bombing, Alex made me feel really bad.

1097
00:58:05,400 --> 00:58:06,400
Oh, that's good.

1098
00:58:06,400 --> 00:58:08,400
He bombed in his friendship with you?

1099
00:58:08,400 --> 00:58:16,520
No, no, no, no. He told me he was fucking with me, but last night I couldn't make a show that

1100
00:58:16,520 --> 00:58:21,120
we were supposed to both be on, so I sent him there with Little Patrick.

1101
00:58:21,120 --> 00:58:22,120
The blow-up doll.

1102
00:58:22,120 --> 00:58:27,080
The blow-up doll. I put a shirt on him that said my name and some pants.

1103
00:58:27,080 --> 00:58:29,960
And did the pants say your name?

1104
00:58:29,960 --> 00:58:30,960
No.

1105
00:58:30,960 --> 00:58:34,440
That's a classic Patrick outfit, is walking around with a t-shirt that says your name

1106
00:58:34,440 --> 00:58:35,440
on it.

1107
00:58:35,440 --> 00:58:36,440
It says Patrick Doren on it.

1108
00:58:36,440 --> 00:58:39,440
Just so that I put it on so the crowd would know it was me.

1109
00:58:39,440 --> 00:58:40,440
Right.

1110
00:58:40,440 --> 00:58:44,040
You know, I mean there's probably some people there that have never seen what I look like.

1111
00:58:44,040 --> 00:58:50,120
And I sent him there and I sent him like 15 different audio files of reactions that I

1112
00:58:50,120 --> 00:58:51,120
could have.

1113
00:58:51,120 --> 00:58:55,120
You know, just like saying stuff like, "Oh, I would have noped the fuck out of there!"

1114
00:58:55,120 --> 00:58:56,120
Like stuff like that.

1115
00:58:56,120 --> 00:58:57,120
Because what was the show?

1116
00:58:57,120 --> 00:59:01,560
It was the Troll 2 Riff Show that Alex asked me to do and then I said, "I can't make it."

1117
00:59:01,560 --> 00:59:04,200
And you definitely couldn't make it.

1118
00:59:04,200 --> 00:59:05,560
Because I thought we were doing the shareholders.

1119
00:59:05,560 --> 00:59:10,200
And so you had a lot of stuff going on, couldn't make it, really wanted to go to the show.

1120
00:59:10,200 --> 00:59:11,200
I got that.

1121
00:59:11,200 --> 00:59:14,720
I got that letter from the IRS and I had the panic attacks.

1122
00:59:14,720 --> 00:59:15,720
I had to stay home.

1123
00:59:15,720 --> 00:59:16,720
You got a letter from the IRS?

1124
00:59:16,720 --> 00:59:18,120
Yeah, I'm not going to talk about that.

1125
00:59:18,120 --> 00:59:22,720
But he called me instantly because I'm his tax guy.

1126
00:59:22,720 --> 00:59:24,400
You are my tax guy.

1127
00:59:24,400 --> 00:59:25,400
Yes.

1128
00:59:25,400 --> 00:59:28,320
I'm really just like you're in case of emergency.

1129
00:59:28,320 --> 00:59:29,320
Anytime.

1130
00:59:29,320 --> 00:59:32,480
I've never gotten a phone call from you and you were just like, what's up, man?

1131
00:59:32,480 --> 00:59:37,580
it's always like can you bring me to the hospital? I'm having something really

1132
00:59:37,580 --> 00:59:42,400
bad. You have a car yeah. It's never you never call me just to catch up. What's

1133
00:59:42,400 --> 00:59:45,940
that about? I see you every day, but still man call you for that. I can, but

1134
00:59:45,940 --> 00:59:49,960
why not just why not just call me one time so that I'm not terrified to answer

1135
00:59:49,960 --> 00:59:53,480
the phone every single time you call me literally yesterday. Every time you call

1136
00:59:53,480 --> 00:59:55,580
me yesterday, I realize this you call me and I go

1137
00:59:55,580 --> 01:00:01,080
and then I answer the phone. I have to do it in your voice. I have to do this. I

1138
01:00:01,100 --> 01:00:06,140
you go what's up yeah and I always am dead serious what's up man yeah what is

1139
01:00:06,140 --> 01:00:09,780
it what do you need well maybe one day you're gonna get a call and it's gonna

1140
01:00:09,780 --> 01:00:16,740
be a prank call for me that I forgot to do star six seven but I sent Alex to the

1141
01:00:16,740 --> 01:00:20,860
show with little Patrick and then he sent me a text that said that bombs so

1142
01:00:20,860 --> 01:00:26,780
fucking hard and I guess it was it didn't bomb but it it would have done

1143
01:00:26,780 --> 01:00:32,180
better if the audio, like if you pick up the mic, could pick up the phone better.

1144
01:00:32,180 --> 01:00:36,140
They did it right out of the phone. That was the problem. Should have set up a full sound

1145
01:00:36,140 --> 01:00:37,140
board for something like that.

1146
01:00:37,140 --> 01:00:38,140
Yeah, exactly.

1147
01:00:38,140 --> 01:00:39,700
Or you could have just showed up.

1148
01:00:39,700 --> 01:00:40,700
I could have just showed up.

1149
01:00:40,700 --> 01:00:43,540
Yeah, yeah, because again, the thing you were going to do got cancelled, so you probably

1150
01:00:43,540 --> 01:00:44,540
could have just gone.

1151
01:00:44,540 --> 01:00:47,940
Yeah, but I think that that bit is funnier.

1152
01:00:47,940 --> 01:00:49,260
Than being there.

1153
01:00:49,260 --> 01:00:50,260
Yes.

1154
01:00:50,260 --> 01:00:51,260
Okay.

1155
01:00:51,260 --> 01:00:56,180
I think sending a blow up doll in your place that has 15 pre-recorded things that are like...

1156
01:00:56,180 --> 01:00:57,780
you had done MF doom

1157
01:00:57,780 --> 01:00:59,780
impersonator. I

1158
01:00:59,780 --> 01:01:05,840
want to do that one time. I want there, but it shouldn't be you. It should be a

1159
01:01:05,840 --> 01:01:07,680
guy dressed up like MF doom. Yeah,

1160
01:01:07,680 --> 01:01:13,200
but guy white guy in an MF doom. Yeah, yeah, I mean if I do any shows on

1161
01:01:13,200 --> 01:01:13,740
Halloween,

1162
01:01:13,740 --> 01:01:18,840
that's what he sound like to me because he's because he's buried underground.

1163
01:01:18,840 --> 01:01:19,680
Yeah,

1164
01:01:22,940 --> 01:01:26,040
they buried him. He's dead now. They burned him. Yeah, I was thinking they

1165
01:01:26,040 --> 01:01:29,860
burned him. They burned him alive. Jedi think they could well.

1166
01:01:29,860 --> 01:01:35,060
They burned him alive and they spread his ashes in a candy store. Yeah, they

1167
01:01:35,060 --> 01:01:37,940
buried him with over all the buried him. They filled his coffin with mac and

1168
01:01:37,940 --> 01:01:40,900
cheese. Can they if you want to do something disgusting with your remains?

1169
01:01:40,900 --> 01:01:43,820
I know I'm not trying to make light of it, but I heard that they

1170
01:01:43,820 --> 01:01:47,740
they laid him on down on a bed of mac and cheese. Really, I swear to God,

1171
01:01:47,740 --> 01:01:52,180
but they crisp the top. I heard that I heard also when they when they they

1172
01:01:52,220 --> 01:01:55,320
lowered his coffin into the ground and they were shoveling dirt on it was

1173
01:01:55,320 --> 01:01:56,200
Oreo crumbs

1174
01:01:56,200 --> 01:01:59,260
here. There was a real comes in gummy worms

1175
01:01:59,260 --> 01:02:03,860
shoveled down on to really yeah, he's not trying to make like I heard any

1176
01:02:03,860 --> 01:02:04,980
gravestone. He's a Graham

1177
01:02:04,980 --> 01:02:15,660
and it's very I mean the saddest part is that the I mean all it was really

1178
01:02:15,660 --> 01:02:17,080
eaten. Yeah,

1179
01:02:18,900 --> 01:02:22,500
big fan. Yeah, and they put him in a beef jerky. That's reminding me.

1180
01:02:22,500 --> 01:02:29,940
That's reminding me that I when Leo was here, I immediately showed him cooking

1181
01:02:29,940 --> 01:02:35,360
with Jack just to, you know, I wanted to show him a true American. Yeah. And he

1182
01:02:35,360 --> 01:02:41,220
liked it. He what he had his mind blown. Yeah, I showed him you show somebody

1183
01:02:41,220 --> 01:02:43,820
aunt Myrna's party cheese salad for the first time.

1184
01:02:45,020 --> 01:02:49,420
fucking mind boggling. Yeah. The part where he's like about to eat it and he

1185
01:02:49,420 --> 01:02:53,460
go or he eats, he takes his first bite and he goes, it's so it's kind of got

1186
01:02:53,460 --> 01:02:58,420
like a pudding effect. He lost his goddamn mind putting effect, putting

1187
01:02:58,420 --> 01:03:03,060
effect, which also my girlfriend met him and I think that she's never met a

1188
01:03:03,060 --> 01:03:08,060
British person in her life. Well, why would you? She was asking him questions

1189
01:03:08,060 --> 01:03:13,500
like, so do you have health care? That's what I do like that. Yeah, you got to

1190
01:03:13,500 --> 01:03:17,500
you ask about Burton? Is this just an American thing? I've known him for so long.

1191
01:03:17,500 --> 01:03:20,940
Every time I see him, I still ask him all the questions about all types of

1192
01:03:20,940 --> 01:03:23,820
different... You wouldn't do that to like a... I think that that's like... I

1193
01:03:23,820 --> 01:03:27,580
would do it to anybody from any different country, but I guess I'm fascinated

1194
01:03:27,580 --> 01:03:32,420
by the world. Yeah. Well, it's just like the funny... Meeting a white person

1195
01:03:32,420 --> 01:03:35,660
from an English speaking country is kinda like when you meet your mom's

1196
01:03:35,660 --> 01:03:36,140
friend

1197
01:03:36,140 --> 01:03:40,940
from work, and you're just asking them just like... What is it like?

1198
01:03:42,460 --> 01:03:43,460
Is my mom weird at work?

1199
01:03:43,460 --> 01:03:44,460
Or does she behave?

1200
01:03:44,460 --> 01:03:46,460
Does my mom wear bikinis at work?

1201
01:03:46,460 --> 01:03:48,700
Does my mom ever talk about me?

1202
01:03:48,700 --> 01:03:49,940
Do you have this at work?

1203
01:03:49,940 --> 01:03:52,100
Do you guys have staplers at work?

1204
01:03:52,100 --> 01:03:56,620
I guess it is kind of like asking what is different about a different place.

1205
01:03:56,620 --> 01:03:57,620
It is like that.

1206
01:03:57,620 --> 01:03:58,620
Oh, now I see the connection.

1207
01:03:58,620 --> 01:03:59,620
Yeah.

1208
01:03:59,620 --> 01:04:00,620
I don't know.

1209
01:04:00,620 --> 01:04:01,620
I've always...

1210
01:04:01,620 --> 01:04:06,380
Julio, in Mexico, do you guys have any animals?

1211
01:04:06,380 --> 01:04:10,020
It's just a very weirdly American thing, I think.

1212
01:04:10,020 --> 01:04:11,780
There's no animals in Mexico.

1213
01:04:11,780 --> 01:04:15,940
it's a very weird American thing that we all do, because we just can't fathom at

1214
01:04:15,940 --> 01:04:19,500
all that other places are normal. I don't like when people say that shit

1215
01:04:19,500 --> 01:04:24,340
about me. I can fathom anything. I'm easily a fathomer yeah. I just I can't.

1216
01:04:24,340 --> 01:04:28,420
I honestly I would I would I would ask those questions about when I find when I

1217
01:04:28,420 --> 01:04:32,780
need somebody else who grew who grew up also in Massachusetts, but like one town

1218
01:04:32,780 --> 01:04:36,060
over I would ask them about it. Yeah, do you have Cumberland Farms? I'm so

1219
01:04:36,260 --> 01:04:41,700
interesting ashby by did you guys know that that I just found this out that

1220
01:04:41,700 --> 01:04:46,380
Wegmans is a New England thing yeah. I never even saw or heard of a way to

1221
01:04:46,380 --> 01:04:50,060
all because I was the mula's market basket had the fucking market cornered

1222
01:04:50,060 --> 01:04:53,620
yeah. I've literally never. I thought Wegmans was a was some from somewhere

1223
01:04:53,620 --> 01:04:56,820
else. I just found out that it's from here. It's really sad that grocery

1224
01:04:56,820 --> 01:05:00,460
stores are regional yeah. It's crazy. They should be going. You know the said

1225
01:05:00,460 --> 01:05:04,020
the one thing that made me sad is that it's a it was a a grocery store that was

1226
01:05:04,060 --> 01:05:07,660
regional to me and I didn't even know it. Yeah, that'll kill you because the

1227
01:05:07,660 --> 01:05:11,420
the family I've never been inside one before my entire life. If you want

1228
01:05:11,420 --> 01:05:14,060
there's one in Dumbo. I know I walked by one in

1229
01:05:14,060 --> 01:05:18,660
they open a new one in Manhattan. That one in Dumbo is like

1230
01:05:18,660 --> 01:05:21,500
it's like a like a warehouse.

1231
01:05:21,500 --> 01:05:26,540
They have so much crap in there. I love the great. Their hot bar is amazing.

1232
01:05:26,540 --> 01:05:32,420
We honestly we should make a pilgrimage. Let's go right now. Do I make I would

1233
01:05:32,460 --> 01:05:37,940
to go. I would really love to go. Is Publix rotisserie chicken fire more than other places?

1234
01:05:37,940 --> 01:05:43,060
It's up there. It's up there. I would say Costco is amazing purely because of the price

1235
01:05:43,060 --> 01:05:46,620
and how big them chickens are. It's not even a chicken anymore. But Publix got the Pub

1236
01:05:46,620 --> 01:05:52,940
Sub. Publix has the Pub Sub. Harris Teeter has an amazing Sub sandwich. We do it differently

1237
01:05:52,940 --> 01:05:56,940
down south at the grocery stores. Market Basket, they got Subs there. I do have to admit that

1238
01:05:56,940 --> 01:06:00,820
you guys do it a little differently. Market Basket's taking something from the Southern

1239
01:06:00,820 --> 01:06:05,780
playbook. Market Basket is cool. The Market Kitchen. Market Basket is not for me man.

1240
01:06:05,780 --> 01:06:09,020
You haven't been to a good one. It used to be cooler. You haven't been to a good one.

1241
01:06:09,020 --> 01:06:12,340
You gotta go to one. It's too full man. You gotta go to a Market Basket. They go fucking

1242
01:06:12,340 --> 01:06:16,780
nuts for Market Basket. It is crazy. It is insane. It is an ant farm in there. It is

1243
01:06:16,780 --> 01:06:21,260
the rudest experiences you will ever have in your life is at a Market Basket. The best

1244
01:06:21,260 --> 01:06:26,380
part is it's an anti-Trader Joe's. It's the anti-Trader Joe's. Yeah, well fuck Trader

1245
01:06:26,380 --> 01:06:30,180
Joe's. Trader Joe's amazing. I like in Market Basket how they make everyone wear the name

1246
01:06:30,180 --> 01:06:32,680
name tags that say how long they've worked there. So you'll see somebody

1247
01:06:32,680 --> 01:06:35,540
who's you see a high schooler and it says one year and you're like, Oh,

1248
01:06:35,540 --> 01:06:38,440
that's nice. And then you see they're working alongside a woman who's 80

1249
01:06:38,440 --> 01:06:42,420
years old and it says 50 years. Yeah, I don't like that. They do it as a

1250
01:06:42,420 --> 01:06:46,320
fingernail tally marks on the thing. Yeah, that's a bad idea. But those

1251
01:06:46,320 --> 01:06:49,680
jackets that they wear, it's cool. Man, those jackets like those jackets are

1252
01:06:49,680 --> 01:06:53,380
you should have you should be forced to work a job as a high schooler where you

1253
01:06:53,380 --> 01:06:56,580
have to wear a jacket. That jacket, I think it's where you have to dress as a

1254
01:06:56,620 --> 01:07:00,860
hop. Yeah, the jackets that they wear there I think are just Dickies Eisenhower

1255
01:07:00,860 --> 01:07:06,280
jackets which is why I own so many. Because you want to work. The

1256
01:07:06,280 --> 01:07:11,340
Market Basket blue jacket is one of the best looking jackets in the world.

1257
01:07:11,340 --> 01:07:16,220
But you went to the one in Somerville or Cambridge or whatever you

1258
01:07:16,220 --> 01:07:20,620
got to go to one that's like got its own dedicated parking lot. Yeah. Like one that

1259
01:07:20,620 --> 01:07:25,020
has like. Dedicated to you. Yeah, dedicated to some kid that died in town.

1260
01:07:26,020 --> 01:07:30,340
to go to one in like the one in like Plastow or something like the fucking or just like

1261
01:07:30,340 --> 01:07:36,220
the one in like like Salem or you're not gonna miss me. It's better. No, no, no, no, no,

1262
01:07:36,220 --> 01:07:42,460
no, no, no, sir. There is a very good market basket in town and what grocery store do they

1263
01:07:42,460 --> 01:07:48,340
have in Los Angeles? Ralph's Ralph's Ralph's and Vons. I'm going to be at Ralph's and Vons

1264
01:07:48,340 --> 01:07:52,860
buying groceries because I'm going to be in Los Angeles doing 30 minutes of stand up comedy

1265
01:07:52,860 --> 01:07:59,220
with my friend Gus Viveiros at The Yard on November 17th. Guys, go get tickets over there

1266
01:07:59,220 --> 01:08:03,420
at the website that we'll put in the description of the episode.

1267
01:08:03,420 --> 01:08:06,380
Gus Viveiros, somebody that shopped at Market Basket a lot.

1268
01:08:06,380 --> 01:08:07,380
He's from Boston.

1269
01:08:07,380 --> 01:08:08,380
Yeah.

1270
01:08:08,380 --> 01:08:10,100
And I'll see you there.

1271
01:08:10,100 --> 01:08:11,100
Oh, and also...

1272
01:08:11,100 --> 01:08:12,100
Yeah, you go first.

1273
01:08:12,100 --> 01:08:13,100
No, you go first.

1274
01:08:13,100 --> 01:08:18,740
Okay. Well, I will be shopping at Jewel Osco on November 5th.

1275
01:08:18,740 --> 01:08:19,740
The hell's Jewel Osco?

1276
01:08:19,740 --> 01:08:20,740
It's a Chicago-based...

1277
01:08:20,740 --> 01:08:21,740
Oh, I see.

1278
01:08:21,740 --> 01:08:30,320
hello. I see grocery store and I will be there opening for girl God and tune in

1279
01:08:30,320 --> 01:08:36,540
on Wednesday for Mars, the beginning of ours, the beginning of the planet month

1280
01:08:36,540 --> 01:08:41,060
in one week. Five do we start from five weeks of planning mercury? Yeah, I meant

1281
01:08:41,060 --> 01:08:45,140
mercury. I was going to be a good one. Every episode is going to be named after

1282
01:08:45,140 --> 01:08:48,300
the planet. It's going to be very simple to follow along. This is a new series.

1283
01:08:48,300 --> 01:08:52,060
we're starting five very excited. Five weeks of planets, five weeks of plan.

1284
01:08:52,060 --> 01:08:57,460
It'll be like planet earth, but it'll be us giving our skewed take on the plan.

1285
01:08:57,460 --> 01:09:03,180
We're gonna be, we're gonna be gonna be science based. Ow, my back, I broke it.

1286
01:09:03,180 --> 01:09:04,180
All right, you're right.

1287
01:09:04,180 --> 01:09:05,380
Bye.

1288
01:09:05,380 --> 01:09:11,300
At the library. Okay, your turn.

1289
01:09:11,300 --> 01:09:18,060
I'm at the library. I've taken out six books at a time. I'm at the library.

1290
01:09:18,060 --> 01:09:20,060
I'm doing more of a hook at this time.

1291
01:09:20,060 --> 01:09:21,060
I think I did more.

1292
01:09:21,060 --> 01:09:22,060
I was singing.

1293
01:09:22,060 --> 01:09:24,060
I'm doing more of the hooks at this time.

1294
01:09:24,060 --> 01:09:26,560
Wait, this might help.

1295
01:09:26,560 --> 01:09:29,060
Reading is not a crime.

1296
01:09:29,060 --> 01:09:30,060
I do it all the time.

1297
01:09:30,060 --> 01:09:31,060
Whoa.

1298
01:09:31,060 --> 01:09:32,060
I'm reading books about limes.

1299
01:09:32,060 --> 01:09:33,060
Damn.

1300
01:09:33,060 --> 01:09:34,060
I'm reading books about limes.

1301
01:09:34,060 --> 01:09:36,060
Lime scooter.

1302
01:09:36,060 --> 01:09:38,060
Hit her in the cooter.

1303
01:09:38,060 --> 01:09:39,060
Hit her? Wait.

1304
01:09:39,060 --> 01:09:41,060
Drop a gunshot.

1305
01:09:41,060 --> 01:09:44,060
Hit her in her cooter.

1306
01:09:44,060 --> 01:09:45,060
With a lime scooter?

1307
01:09:45,060 --> 01:09:47,060
With a lime scooter.

1308
01:09:47,060 --> 01:09:49,700
Lime scooter directly to the cooter.

1309
01:09:49,700 --> 01:09:52,020
Doing some evil,

1310
01:09:52,020 --> 01:09:54,540
Knievel shit into a woman's evil.

1311
01:09:54,540 --> 01:09:57,220
This is a good way to learn about your instincts.

1312
01:09:57,220 --> 01:10:01,020
My instincts store hurting women's vagina

1313
01:10:01,020 --> 01:10:07,180
but with a cutting edge application based technology,

1314
01:10:07,180 --> 01:10:10,900
using application vehicle to hurt a woman or thing.

1315
01:10:10,900 --> 01:10:12,260
I went in a self driving car.

1316
01:10:12,260 --> 01:10:13,020
Really?

1317
01:10:13,020 --> 01:10:13,540
Yeah.

1318
01:10:16,500 --> 01:10:23,100
I was in, uh, yo, I don't, well, I was in Phoenix basically and, um.

1319
01:10:23,100 --> 01:10:24,100
A rap is about it.

1320
01:10:24,100 --> 01:10:26,100
Yeah, you have to rap about it.

1321
01:10:26,100 --> 01:10:31,100
Yo, imagine a work, well, actually turn this beat, uh, keep it the same actually.

1322
01:10:31,100 --> 01:10:33,800
I was in a car that had nobody driving in it.

1323
01:10:33,800 --> 01:10:35,500
I felt like a creamed spinach.

1324
01:10:35,500 --> 01:10:39,100
I had, I literally got exploded on with the whole vehicle exploded.

1325
01:10:39,100 --> 01:10:39,900
It was crazy.

1326
01:10:39,900 --> 01:10:41,100
Phoenix fell into the earth.

1327
01:10:41,100 --> 01:10:41,600
What?

1328
01:10:41,600 --> 01:10:44,100
And then I, and then I blow up all crazy.

1329
01:10:44,100 --> 01:10:46,900
I have no, I have no idea what's happening to me.

1330
01:10:46,900 --> 01:10:48,300
I got a lobster hot pocket.

1331
01:10:48,300 --> 01:10:49,260
Oh,

1332
01:10:49,260 --> 01:10:54,900
I met two hot, two, two girls with two lobster hot pockets.

1333
01:10:54,900 --> 01:10:56,780
I said, getting the self-driving vehicle.

1334
01:10:56,780 --> 01:10:58,460
You got to go down and knock it.

1335
01:10:58,460 --> 01:11:00,620
Show you what, what it's like when I'm laughing at Jason.

1336
01:11:00,620 --> 01:11:00,900
See you.

1337
01:11:00,900 --> 01:11:01,260
The goal

1338
01:11:01,260 --> 01:11:13,220
vehicle to see your goal is insanely good, man.

1339
01:11:13,260 --> 01:11:15,960
That's the type of shit that I'm expressing myself about for a second.

1340
01:11:15,960 --> 01:11:16,660
Alright, Cameron.

1341
01:11:16,660 --> 01:11:17,160
Okay.

1342
01:11:17,160 --> 01:11:19,260
Well...

1343
01:11:19,260 --> 01:11:24,760
Well, I'm sitting here and I can't...

1344
01:11:24,760 --> 01:11:25,760
Oh, it ended.

1345
01:11:25,760 --> 01:11:27,760
