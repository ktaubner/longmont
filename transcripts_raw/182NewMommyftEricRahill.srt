1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,580
(upbeat music)

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:10,560
- That was a really good one.

3
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:12,880
- I think you're supposed to clap into the mic.

4
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:13,920
- What, fuck you.

5
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:17,160
- Okay.

6
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:18,720
- He could've heard it anyway, man.

7
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:20,040
- Yeah, that's true.

8
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:20,880
- What's up, Eric?

9
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:21,720
- What's up, guys?

10
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:22,560
- How are you?

11
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:24,040
- Well, I'm amazing now.

12
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:26,600
- Yeah, 'cause now you're doing your favorite thing ever?

13
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:27,440
- Podcasting.

14
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:34,980
Do you feel like podcasting is entering the same strata as, not, I think it's past

15
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:35,980
television.

16
00:00:35,980 --> 00:00:36,980
Yeah.

17
00:00:36,980 --> 00:00:37,980
That's obvious.

18
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:41,680
But entering into movies, high art, stuff that hangs in museums.

19
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:44,560
Yeah, I think we're in third wave podcasts right now.

20
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:45,560
Yeah.

21
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:49,560
Started out with the Marons and the like, I'm trying to think of who else.

22
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:51,560
Jimmy, Pete Holmes.

23
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:52,560
Pete Holmes.

24
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:53,560
Pete Holmes.

25
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:57,120
Yeah, Car Talk was really big for a while before the guy passed away.

26
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:02,760
now I don't know what the second wave was, but now it's third wave and we're just going crazy on these things.

27
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:04,160
Do you think it's a golden age?

28
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:06,520
Dude, I mean, I feel people should feel lucky.

29
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:08,920
The golden age of podcasting or is that past?

30
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:13,640
Because the golden age was probably, yes, like the mayor, like you made it weird.

31
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:16,760
Yeah. Come on, that wasn't a golden age, that was a bronze age.

32
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:17,520
That was the bronze age?

33
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:19,040
That was, they didn't know what the fuck they were doing.

34
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:21,320
Yeah. They didn't realize they could do this shit.

35
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:23,760
They could, they had no idea.

36
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:25,720
I'm so jealous of this setup.

37
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:27,480
You need one of these. It's like the breakfast club.

38
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:29,960
It's bad. We need Angela Yee in here badly.

39
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:30,960
Oh my God.

40
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:33,280
But yeah, I think that we're entering...

41
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:37,920
I think that there will be in probably five years,

42
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:41,960
classes at certain colleges like Oberlin and stuff.

43
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:42,600
Vassar.

44
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:45,200
You will take a history of podcasting class.

45
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:46,800
I think there is a podcasting class at Vassar.

46
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:50,120
And there will be a history though, like an art history one,

47
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:52,360
where you will be learning all about...

48
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:53,360
Adjunct professor.

49
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:54,760
You will be an adjunct professor,

50
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:59,120
but you will be learning about the watermelon guy

51
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:01,280
who ran off on Mark Maron.

52
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:02,120
- Gallagher, yeah.

53
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:05,960
- Gallagher, you will be learning about all the times

54
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:08,760
that Pete Holmes made it weird and awkward on his show.

55
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:10,200
- He made it so weird.

56
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:12,040
Does he realize how weird he made it?

57
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:12,880
- I hope not.

58
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:14,840
- I think he was going out

59
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:17,260
with the intention of making it weird.

60
00:02:17,260 --> 00:02:19,000
I think he wanted to make it weird.

61
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,080
'Cause the name of the show.

62
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:23,600
- I think it's, you know what I think is weird with him?

63
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:26,200
Letting people have sex with your wife, that's fucking weird.

64
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:28,960
(laughing)

65
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:31,280
Why are you doing that, Pete Holmes?

66
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:33,640
- He's a Christian swinger, is that his whole thing?

67
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:34,560
- Oh, is he a swinger?

68
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:35,480
- Yeah. - Yeah.

69
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:37,120
- I mean, hey yo, you know,

70
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:38,880
people are getting all into this right now.

71
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:40,200
- Yeah, swinging?

72
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:41,400
It's back on the rise. - Yeah, it's what everybody

73
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:42,520
likes these days.

74
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:44,800
- People heard all these stories about their uncle

75
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,720
going to key parties in the '70s,

76
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:49,040
and they're like, "Damn, I gotta get more pussy

77
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:49,920
"than my uncle."

78
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:50,960
- Yeah. - Yeah.

79
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:52,520
- So now they're-- - I don't like it at all.

80
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:55,700
I think it's wrong. I think it's wrong. Definitely wrong.

81
00:02:55,700 --> 00:02:59,660
Well, we're three really good guys. And so I think our moral compasses are so

82
00:02:59,660 --> 00:03:05,360
like, are not right, but so right. So right in the middle. We're very, we're

83
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:06,040
also

84
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:12,520
maybe we're just quick to, to, to, to try to be right about everything because

85
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:16,000
we're so used to it, you know? So maybe swinging is actually, maybe it is good.

86
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,040
Maybe it's, and maybe we're just, I mean, I've never tried it. I don't think I

87
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:22,400
will. But it does just disgust me so much.

88
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:25,240
People would want your ass so badly, Caleb. I just gotta tell you.

89
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:28,040
If I showed... No. You're fucking around. You would be in high demand.

90
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:31,760
If I showed up at a swinger party... Well, I think that that might be true,

91
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:34,140
but I think that's because most of the people there are 60 years old.

92
00:03:34,140 --> 00:03:37,240
Yeah. So you think... I would show up and they would think that I was...

93
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:40,880
Well, it would be like you'd get invited to some Brooklyn one.

94
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:45,040
I don't want to even think about this. In some gross... Think about some Bushwick

95
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:48,640
swinger party in some tiny ass apartment with black mold. Everybody got the

96
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:54,920
armpit hair popping out, leg hair, the whitey tighties. I'd be sitting there, I'd be looking

97
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:57,760
through people's keys, seeing who has the coolest keychains there.

98
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:58,760
Hey, hipsters.

99
00:03:58,760 --> 00:03:59,760
Because they're all on carabiners.

100
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:00,760
True.

101
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:01,760
Yeah.

102
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:04,040
I want to get some whitey tighties, by the way.

103
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:05,680
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

104
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:06,680
You're not scared?

105
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:07,680
No, scared of what?

106
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:08,680
The dookie?

107
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:12,280
Oh, you mean, well, I'll get some blue, navy blue.

108
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:16,920
Those are not, those are bluey-dooeys. That is not a whitey tighty. That is not a whitey

109
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:17,920
tighty.

110
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:20,400
- I have a picture of Mr. Brian Cranston

111
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:21,800
in the first season of Breaking Bad.

112
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:22,640
- Yes.

113
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:23,720
- Where he's like outside the motor home

114
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:24,680
and he's got the--

115
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:26,000
- And he got the nub.

116
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,440
- He's got the nub, but he's also got the--

117
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:30,640
- The garters?

118
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:31,480
- What are they?

119
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:32,480
The Clark's chukkas.

120
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:33,320
- Yeah, I know what you're talking about.

121
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:36,120
- Okay, he's got those, or the desert whatever,

122
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:38,520
not desert boots, but, and he's got the whitey tighties.

123
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:40,880
I think he looks sexy there.

124
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:43,200
And I think I would like to look like that.

125
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:44,440
- You wanna enter into--

126
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:45,280
- You're just trying to do that,

127
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:47,800
you're trying to get your Halloween costume together.

128
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:49,340
trying to get your ducks in a row for that.

129
00:04:49,340 --> 00:04:50,180
- Or like something to shoot for.

130
00:04:50,180 --> 00:04:51,880
- You're gonna be Heisenberg?

131
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:53,960
- I guess I could be Heisenberg.

132
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:57,000
- You would need to put on a shaved head.

133
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:57,960
- Yeah, I'm not--

134
00:04:57,960 --> 00:04:59,140
- That's fine.

135
00:04:59,140 --> 00:05:01,000
But I do think that is a little bit your swag

136
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,240
of like big t-shirt, tiny little thing

137
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:05,160
covering your penis and butt.

138
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:06,720
- You're talking about the Pooh Bear effect.

139
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:09,480
- Yeah, the Pooh, yes, I was talking about the Pooh Bear.

140
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:10,320
- You know about that last episode?

141
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:11,560
- We were talking about last episode,

142
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:15,920
the fact that I walk around with just the big shirt on

143
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:17,720
and no pants at all, my dingle hanging.

144
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:20,720
Do you still have that really big shirt I got you?

145
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:22,720
No, my wife made me throw it away.

146
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:24,720
Yeah, I think it's here in the costume.

147
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:25,720
Oh, maybe I think it's right here.

148
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:28,720
I gave him a 4XL shirt with a drawing I made.

149
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:29,720
And you threw it away?

150
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:31,720
His wife did not like it.

151
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:36,720
I mean, okay, so it's 4XL, so that's four shirts worth of material that I have to store in my house.

152
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:37,720
It's a tent.

153
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:42,720
And I live in a tiny one-bedroom apartment, 475 square feet.

154
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:43,720
Yeah.

155
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:44,720
Well, I...

156
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:46,720
I wasn't going to ever make that work.

157
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:52,120
also got you I used to when my money was right. He's the just send my friends

158
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:57,120
gifts all the time. I got him a kingdom heart snap back. He did. He used to buy

159
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:00,320
me. That's why our old office, which you never went to our old office was so

160
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:04,920
fucked up and full of shit. Swagged out. No, it was terrible. It was so bad

161
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:08,160
because it was just a place where Patrick every single day would buy

162
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:11,960
something that cost 99 cents because he thought it was funny and then just leave

163
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:16,440
it in the office and it was just trash. I got it was stuff that I got for my

164
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:22,960
friends. That's the only reason why I want to say this though. I feel like if

165
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:26,960
you're giving gifts, whatever at this income or whatever income you're at, it

166
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:31,520
says a lot about where you're headed in terms of like your character and what

167
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:35,160
you're gonna, how you're gonna be hooking up the day ones. That's some real shit.

168
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:41,440
It says a lot about you. Do you like to give gifts? Me? I like to give money

169
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:46,480
because and not not kingdom hearts hats and stuff. I give straight cash.

170
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:47,720
Forty dollars? Yes.

171
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:49,760
And with singles.

172
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:53,920
Being quiet to your mom, like I got you mom.

173
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:56,560
I feel like I'm Drake.

174
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:59,560
Just whatever cash is in.

175
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:03,920
Loose bills, like one twenty and then the rest is like ones and fives. Yeah.

176
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:05,600
Mama go get a car wash, here you go.

177
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:11,040
You know that I treat you right. Mr. Gandalfini did that. Really? He was giving

178
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:15,280
people on my envelopes. I think he got to I don't want to go on the Sopranos, but I

179
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:18,440
think he got to into the character. Well, yeah, that's that's what that is right

180
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:22,920
with Junker. Well, they both got to into the character, which is so fucking scary.

181
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:26,560
Do you think? But don't you as an actor, by the way, I've filmed like I told you

182
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:29,160
I'm filming this in black and white because you know that you're not a camera

183
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:33,280
turn on. I just kind of like my little chain. Yeah, you did change. I know right

184
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:37,040
where the angle is every single time. Yes, you can hit it perfectly. Yeah. So

185
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:42,040
What is, are you waiting on that big Heath Ledger Joker role?

186
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:44,000
The one that will consume you?

187
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,480
- Yeah, what's the scariest role you're gonna take?

188
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:48,720
- Scariest role I'm gonna take?

189
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:50,520
Probably some type of professor.

190
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:51,960
- Why would that?

191
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:54,680
Do you just think you'd be so good at embodying that role

192
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:56,160
that it would just be terrifying to you?

193
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:59,040
- I think so, 'cause you remember "Beautiful Mind"

194
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:02,920
with Russell Crowe, and he's so differently smart.

195
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:03,800
- Australian, oh.

196
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:06,480
- Yeah, oh yeah, and he's Australian or whatever.

197
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:08,360
but he goes crazy in it.

198
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:11,800
I would love to bring kind of facts to it,

199
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:13,560
to be like super into it.

200
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:16,200
- You want to play, I've always,

201
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:18,000
and I've talked to you about this, I know.

202
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,500
I think that you would be an incredible Sherlock Holmes.

203
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:23,800
And I think that you-- - The American?

204
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:25,480
Or would I go British style with it?

205
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:27,280
- Oh, wait, wait. - I think that you could do

206
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:31,360
even a third, you could be a Canadian or an Australian,

207
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:32,880
some other English speaking country.

208
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:34,040
- Yeah. - Their version of--

209
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:37,160
Has there been an American Sherlock Holmes?

210
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:39,800
There hasn't. I think that there was.

211
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:43,480
I mean, Robert Downey, but he was British, but he was British.

212
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:45,360
I'm talking like. House MD.

213
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:47,240
House MD. You guys already have.

214
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:51,480
I know people make comparisons of who you guys should be as the podcast, but Cam is

215
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:52,880
clearly Sherlock. Yes.

216
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:54,040
You're clearly Watson.

217
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:57,680
OK. OK. And you're clearly the supervillain that's about to destroy London with a...

218
00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:58,680
Moriarty.

219
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:01,240
Moriarty.

220
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:07,440
I don't know too much about Sherlock Holmes. I know he's a detective.

221
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:08,680
You've got to study the texts.

222
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:11,200
Yeah, I mean you are a complete Wasson.

223
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:12,200
Yeah?

224
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:13,200
Yeah. Just bumbling around.

225
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:14,200
I've got to check it out.

226
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:15,200
Wait no, Wasson's smart.

227
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:16,200
He's bumbling?

228
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:21,000
No, no, no. You're his cat or something. You're like something that knocks over beakers and

229
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
shit.

230
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Like beaker?

231
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Yeah, you could be.

232
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,280
You're like beaker, yes. You're like beaker a little bit and I'm Professor Honeydew or

233
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:28,280
whatever his name is.

234
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:29,280
Bunsen Honeydew.

235
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:30,280
Bunsen Honeydew, yeah.

236
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:32,800
Don't try and test my muppet knowledge.

237
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:36,640
I wouldn't even think of it. But I think that that would be a good role for you.

238
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:37,640
I know Muppets you've never heard of.

239
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:41,720
Because that would give you a chance to play. You know those scenes that get posted on YouTube

240
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:47,600
for movies and television that are like smartest scene ever, smart monologue about life and

241
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:51,400
stuff. I was just watching True Detective season one last night, and I always thought

242
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:56,680
that that is the coolest role ever. And then last night I was watching, I was like, I think

243
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:58,920
that this is so, so bad.

244
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:02,160
Really? It went bad style? Who? McConaughey?

245
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:06,760
McConaughey? Yeah, McConaughey is Russ Cole. He's just like in the car.

246
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:14,880
His name's Russ Cole? Russ Cole. Oh my God. Are you serious? Russ. First name Russ,

247
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:20,280
last name Cole. That's like a middle schooler coming up with a cowboy name.

248
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:25,240
Yeah, Russ Cole and he's in the car like, "There's something so messed up about

249
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:27,240
The world is all fucking weird.

250
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:29,240
The world is completely browned.

251
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:34,920
I remember being 17 and looking at YouTube, I was obsessed with YouTube and I would look

252
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:37,240
at SNL auditions because people would post their tapes.

253
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:38,240
Even back in 2008, 2009.

254
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:42,920
People would post their like, yeah the whole clip of like themselves self-filming.

255
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:46,720
Yeah trying to get on SNL, trying to get like someone please contact their producers.

256
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:50,960
And there was this one guy who mostly his whole audition was just McConaughey and I

257
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:52,440
thought it was so good.

258
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:54,880
I left like five comments being like, literally dude,

259
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:56,420
like nobody's doing it like you.

260
00:10:56,420 --> 00:10:57,980
(all laughing)

261
00:10:57,980 --> 00:10:59,580
Like I was obsessed with this guy.

262
00:10:59,580 --> 00:11:00,420
- I thought you were looking at,

263
00:11:00,420 --> 00:11:01,720
I thought you meant like,

264
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:04,140
like you were looking at like Will Ferrell's audition tape.

265
00:11:04,140 --> 00:11:07,220
I didn't know people were going Jake Novak, like back then.

266
00:11:07,220 --> 00:11:09,020
- Oh, they've been doing Jake Novak style.

267
00:11:09,020 --> 00:11:09,860
- People have always been trying to get on us.

268
00:11:09,860 --> 00:11:12,540
- And God bless Jake Novak, by the way, please.

269
00:11:12,540 --> 00:11:14,740
- Literally, it is so fucked up,

270
00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:16,820
collectively, what everyone did to him.

271
00:11:16,820 --> 00:11:18,100
- He has to get on "SNL".

272
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:19,700
He deserves it more than anybody.

273
00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:21,800
- A walk on thing.

274
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:23,320
He deserves something.

275
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:25,600
He should be, because you know, they have SNLs in every country.

276
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:25,840
Do you know?

277
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:26,240
Yeah.

278
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:26,720
Oh, yeah.

279
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:28,160
He should be on like SNL Brazil.

280
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:29,040
We talked about...

281
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:29,800
He would crush that.

282
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:31,480
SNL Quebec.

283
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:32,920
Oh, I didn't know they had a Canada.

284
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:40,640
Which they have like a really like the cast name is like if SNL was trying to come up with an SNL Quebec.

285
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:41,760
Yeah, they have a French kids.

286
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:44,200
Oh, they're all named like Guillaume, Guillaume or something.

287
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:44,920
Guillaume.

288
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:45,600
Bong Bong.

289
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:46,800
Yeah. Hong Bong?

290
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:47,480
Bong Bong.

291
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:47,880
Oh.

292
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:49,080
Bong Bong.

293
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:50,080
That's a French name.

294
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:51,080
Yeah, that's actually a good one.

295
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:53,000
Bong Bong is not a French name.

296
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,720
I think that's a candy.

297
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:58,720
I think Jake Novak would thrive in any kind of sketch comedy scenario.

298
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:00,400
I really think that he's talented.

299
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:04,520
And also, the thing that people don't realize about SNL, it's not like he's going to get

300
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:06,080
up there and write the shit.

301
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:07,080
No.

302
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:08,080
Right?

303
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:10,640
They're going to write stuff for him and he's going to knock it out of the park every time

304
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:12,720
because he does have an amazing voice.

305
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:13,720
He has a beautiful face.

306
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:14,720
He'd be perfect for impressions.

307
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:17,480
He has kind of a Dana Carvey kind of look to him.

308
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:18,480
Yes.

309
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:19,480
Let him on, dude.

310
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:25,760
way socially conscious. Yes. Which you can't say that much about. Oh yeah. Wait I forgot.

311
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:30,400
Bad Gun. That song's a banger. Land of the free, home of the brave. I know. Land of the

312
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:34,800
AR-15, home of kids in the grave. Home of the kids in the grave. God damn. What? Trying

313
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:39,560
to keep the disposition sunny. I'm trying to always find the unfunny things funny but.

314
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:45,280
Whoa. You got a memory like that. I try, I listen to it a lot. He did. He listened to

315
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:47,280
You're showing like strangers on the train.

316
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:49,280
Kind of, that is what Patrick does.

317
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:51,280
I do that a lot. I show people videos on my phone.

318
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:53,280
It's really annoying, but

319
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:55,280
the videos are always really good.

320
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:57,280
And then you win them back onto your side.

321
00:12:57,280 --> 00:12:59,280
It's annoying when I put the phone up

322
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:01,280
but then they see the video

323
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:03,280
donkey hit by train, Pakistan railway.

324
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:05,280
No, you're watching these?

325
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:07,280
Have you ever seen that video?

326
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:09,280
No, I can't watch a donkey get hit.

327
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:11,280
What? A donkey?

328
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:13,280
Dude, you...

329
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:19,880
I watched a video of these ants helping each other across like a little gap in the leaves.

330
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:23,360
There's three ants and they're all, or four ants are all working together. They form a

331
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:27,160
bridge and three of the ants make it across and they don't go back and help the other

332
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:28,160
one.

333
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:29,160
And you cry.

334
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:32,360
And I literally, and there's multiple videos of this. Apparently this is a thing for the

335
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:37,920
ants. And I was thinking, fuck you all. I was getting so mad on behalf of the stranded

336
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:38,920
ant, dude.

337
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:44,520
Fucked up, but they don't think of themselves even as people. They're like, they think of themselves as ants or whatever

338
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:50,400
They're like part of a bigger system. Yeah, they got like a hive mind. Yeah, right. I don't know. No, that's bees

339
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:57,320
Yeah, bees have the bees definitely have a hive mind. I think ants have a similar thing. Yeah. Yeah

340
00:13:57,320 --> 00:13:59,320
I think you're gonna have to change whatever

341
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:03,760
Roles you're getting ready to play because of how shredded you're getting in the gym recently

342
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:06,680
We, well, you know that we are lifting all the time.

343
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:07,640
Do you know this, Patrick?

344
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:08,480
I know that about you guys.

345
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:09,300
We're going, yeah.

346
00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:11,480
I'm like, I have to like, I'm not stretching at all,

347
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:13,680
so I have to move my neck like this.

348
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:15,680
Dude, I'm getting stronger than you can imagine.

349
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:18,000
(laughing)

350
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,520
Yeah, we do not do stretching.

351
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:22,680
I hurt myself once a week.

352
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:24,440
Caleb, what was it, your Achilles?

353
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:26,880
I thought that I ruptured my Achilles like Kobe

354
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:27,700
Oh, damn.

355
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:28,540
Two days ago, but I just hurt a little bit.

356
00:14:28,540 --> 00:14:30,400
You guys don't stretch at all?

357
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:31,240
Not, no.

358
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:32,080
I have the time, motherfucker.

359
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:35,500
I'm doing the like loser stretches of just like the hamstring.

360
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:37,080
And I'll go like this.

361
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:39,280
This? What is that doing for you?

362
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:40,740
That gets the forearm all loose.

363
00:14:40,740 --> 00:14:42,000
Oh, OK.

364
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,120
But yeah, no, we've been consistent too.

365
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:46,880
I stretch. I stretch a lot.

366
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:48,160
When are you going to get in the gym with us?

367
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:49,200
We're trying to get everything.

368
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:51,000
I might try to start going.

369
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:51,800
Honestly, I did.

370
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:57,040
I saw my side profile in a store window and I was like, damn, I got I got long.

371
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:59,380
I got long width wise.

372
00:14:59,380 --> 00:15:01,540
You got long width. You look skinny.

373
00:15:01,540 --> 00:15:03,940
Yeah, you do look skinny. I was just thinking you're looking skinny.

374
00:15:03,940 --> 00:15:07,220
I don't know. Maybe it was a maybe I was looking at a fun house.

375
00:15:07,220 --> 00:15:08,700
Yeah, you need to stop going to the circus.

376
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:10,180
I got to stop going to the circus.

377
00:15:10,180 --> 00:15:11,340
What the fuck is wrong with you?

378
00:15:11,340 --> 00:15:15,260
No, but I stretch. I'd like I mean, because I'd like still skate.

379
00:15:15,260 --> 00:15:18,220
So I like my bones.

380
00:15:18,220 --> 00:15:21,060
I wake up in like 16 bones crack, I think.

381
00:15:21,060 --> 00:15:22,940
Really? It's that's normal.

382
00:15:22,940 --> 00:15:24,700
It's good to crack so bad. It's good to crack.

383
00:15:24,700 --> 00:15:27,140
Oh, it hurts to wake up. Yeah, really?

384
00:15:27,140 --> 00:15:29,740
It's fine. Yoga or something.

385
00:15:29,740 --> 00:15:34,880
Yeah, I started doing I started doing the I found this like this guy who's like the

386
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:40,300
skate yogi on YouTube and he was doing these videos and like the first couple

387
00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:44,080
minutes of the workout was easy. It was like a 10 minute like Oh, do this before

388
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:47,900
you go skate, you'll like, you know, all your shit will be limber. And then he's

389
00:15:47,900 --> 00:15:52,380
like, Okay, now lift up from your feet like that, like trying to lift your whole

390
00:15:52,380 --> 00:15:56,580
body on the way to your feet. And I tried that and I just bled out like

391
00:15:58,220 --> 00:16:03,220
It was the weirdest noise I've ever made in my entire life.

392
00:16:03,220 --> 00:16:05,700
I didn't, it was so involuntary.

393
00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:07,860
I was just like, there's no way I'm doing this.

394
00:16:07,860 --> 00:16:09,220
And I had to, I had to stop.

395
00:16:09,220 --> 00:16:11,880
I think that my body is not meant for stretching.

396
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:14,220
It hurts me so bad to stretch.

397
00:16:14,220 --> 00:16:17,340
I mean, you know, sometimes when we do those stretches

398
00:16:17,340 --> 00:16:20,300
where you sit down and you lock your legs

399
00:16:20,300 --> 00:16:21,860
and you try to touch your toes.

400
00:16:21,860 --> 00:16:23,380
The feeling that my legs give me,

401
00:16:23,380 --> 00:16:25,060
it's like, that's the worst feeling I've ever felt in my life.

402
00:16:25,060 --> 00:16:25,900
It's gotta be number one.

403
00:16:25,900 --> 00:16:28,900
- Stab, not stab, but-- - Slit.

404
00:16:28,900 --> 00:16:30,860
- Yeah, maybe slit. - Sliced.

405
00:16:30,860 --> 00:16:32,460
You'd rather be sliced than do that.

406
00:16:32,460 --> 00:16:33,500
- It's just the most,

407
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:36,540
why do our bodies hate what's good for them?

408
00:16:36,540 --> 00:16:37,380
- Yeah. - You know what I mean?

409
00:16:37,380 --> 00:16:39,180
- It's true. - Why the hell is this?

410
00:16:39,180 --> 00:16:41,820
- Why is it that vegetables taste like doo-doo

411
00:16:41,820 --> 00:16:46,220
to people like us, but candy and bread tastes so incredible?

412
00:16:46,220 --> 00:16:47,460
- I don't know what it is.

413
00:16:47,460 --> 00:16:49,700
- Yesterday, I had probably the worst diet

414
00:16:49,700 --> 00:16:50,740
I've ever had in my entire life.

415
00:16:50,740 --> 00:16:52,580
I ate breakfast, lunch, and dinner,

416
00:16:52,580 --> 00:16:53,940
all three of them were sandwiches.

417
00:16:53,940 --> 00:16:55,500
- Jimmy John's, we had Jimmy John's yesterday.

418
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:59,100
Jimmy John's. I had a breakfast sandwich, a tuna sandwich, and a Jimmy John's

419
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:03,420
sandwich. Those were my meals of the day. That is such a bad way to live. You do

420
00:17:03,420 --> 00:17:08,980
that every day, don't you? That was a good couple years of my life. Just three

421
00:17:08,980 --> 00:17:12,860
sandwiches a day? Sandwiches and chips. Three square sandwiches every single day.

422
00:17:12,860 --> 00:17:16,980
That is so fucking good. I also want to be the first maybe on a podcast to welcome Jimmy

423
00:17:16,980 --> 00:17:22,180
John's to New York City. Yes. Port Green, bordering on Best Buy. They do it right

424
00:17:22,180 --> 00:17:27,060
right there. Yes, they really do. I didn't know they didn't have Jimmy

425
00:17:27,060 --> 00:17:29,140
Johns in... I thought Jimmy Johns was

426
00:17:29,140 --> 00:17:33,140
like a Jersey franchise. Oh, fuck. That's Jersey Mike. Jersey Mike. Wait,

427
00:17:33,140 --> 00:17:33,580
hold on.

428
00:17:33,580 --> 00:17:41,580
That's fucking embarrassing as shit. Can you imagine being the first morning

429
00:17:41,580 --> 00:17:44,060
radio... You realize you could do this?

430
00:17:44,060 --> 00:17:48,060
Yeah, I was thinking about what was the first

431
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:54,040
ways that they put on a soundboard for like a stern or whatever.

432
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:58,080
But I mean, they were probably putting like amber alerts.

433
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:03,000
They got probably all the utilities back then.

434
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,380
All those children were getting that.

435
00:18:04,380 --> 00:18:08,720
The buttons used to only be for amber alerts and like weather reports

436
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:09,840
and stuff like that.

437
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:13,980
And then one guy was like, a child has gone missing in Orange, New Jersey.

438
00:18:13,980 --> 00:18:20,480
Oh, my God.

439
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:22,520
Tornado alert for your county.

440
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:24,520
Oh my God!

441
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:28,320
Oh my God.

442
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:29,280
Yeah, that'd be fun.

443
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:32,080
You know that thing that they do when children go missing

444
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:34,200
or they're looking for a body in a field or something?

445
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:34,620
Yeah.

446
00:18:34,620 --> 00:18:38,280
And you have to go comb the premises.

447
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:39,080
With the dogs.

448
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:41,420
With the dogs, but also in a human line.

449
00:18:41,420 --> 00:18:41,760
Yeah.

450
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:44,220
Or they'll do that if they're trying to find someone in the water.

451
00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:45,000
Yeah.

452
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:48,880
I was thinking like if I was asked to do that, I would get bored so fucking quick.

453
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:53,700
That's why we are doing a podcast.

454
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:56,100
Because what do you need in your headphones when you're doing this shit

455
00:18:56,100 --> 00:18:57,500
to keep yourself focused?

456
00:18:57,500 --> 00:19:01,100
Doing busy work like the dishes or hunting for a human body.

457
00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:05,500
You put in the air pods and you pop on a fucking pot about list.

458
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:06,500
The two things everyone's always doing.

459
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:08,500
If I could listen to smart lists all day.

460
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:09,200
Exactly.

461
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:09,700
Yeah.

462
00:19:09,700 --> 00:19:10,900
Looking for bodies all day.

463
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:15,700
Pot about list or your podcast Joy Tactics, which people should go and check out.

464
00:19:15,700 --> 00:19:17,700
You can do it with Jack Benson or Nate Veron.

465
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:19,700
around and yeah we go crazy.

466
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:20,700
They do go crazy.

467
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:22,620
Yeah. What do you think?

468
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:24,100
How do you feel being

469
00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:26,180
how many months in are you?

470
00:19:26,180 --> 00:19:28,160
Oh, what do we when we start end of

471
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:29,180
January?

472
00:19:29,180 --> 00:19:30,800
So, oh, whoa.

473
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:32,340
First of all, what I didn't realize

474
00:19:32,340 --> 00:19:33,880
it was that I didn't realize it was

475
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:36,220
that that long

476
00:19:36,220 --> 00:19:38,300
again. No, that that short of a time.

477
00:19:38,300 --> 00:19:39,160
Yeah, it's been like three and a

478
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:40,460
half months. Yeah. Three and a half

479
00:19:40,460 --> 00:19:41,820
months. I fucking I thought that you

480
00:19:41,820 --> 00:19:42,900
guys were around forever.

481
00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:44,940
You guys have blazed a trail.

482
00:19:45,860 --> 00:19:48,060
Yeah, dude, we're kind of top of the charts.

483
00:19:48,060 --> 00:19:49,100
They are top of the charts.

484
00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:51,140
First of all, welcome to the family.

485
00:19:51,140 --> 00:19:53,540
Yeah. Second of all, thanks, guys.

486
00:19:53,540 --> 00:19:56,820
How has it changed your life more than any decision you've ever made?

487
00:19:56,820 --> 00:19:57,460
Bar none?

488
00:19:57,460 --> 00:20:00,020
Um, yeah, I guess other than

489
00:20:00,020 --> 00:20:02,020
becoming atheist.

490
00:20:02,020 --> 00:20:03,020
Yeah.

491
00:20:03,020 --> 00:20:06,220
So on the same level,

492
00:20:06,220 --> 00:20:10,180
yeah, when you went back, right?

493
00:20:10,180 --> 00:20:11,660
Yeah, I'll go back.

494
00:20:11,660 --> 00:20:12,740
That's why it was awful.

495
00:20:12,740 --> 00:20:14,340
Every time, probably every week.

496
00:20:14,540 --> 00:20:19,180
Yeah, yeah. Every time it's bad, you become Christian again.

497
00:20:19,180 --> 00:20:23,260
Yeah. It's either God's fault or it's my fault because I didn't have God with me.

498
00:20:23,260 --> 00:20:23,760
Yes.

499
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:24,620
You know what I mean?

500
00:20:24,620 --> 00:20:25,120
Yeah.

501
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:31,180
Did your mom ever hit you with a, "That's God punishing you," when you hit your head on the door or something?

502
00:20:31,180 --> 00:20:36,700
My mom was not that much of a psycho bitch, it seems like your mom was if she was saying that shit to you.

503
00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:39,580
My mom was Irish Catholic, so yes.

504
00:20:39,580 --> 00:20:40,080
Yeah.

505
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:42,620
Yeah, my mom never said anything like that to me.

506
00:20:42,620 --> 00:20:45,580
I would hit my head on like a door or something. She's like, that's God's

507
00:20:45,580 --> 00:20:49,740
pun. That's God punishing you. And I guess it's supposed to be a joke, but it

508
00:20:49,740 --> 00:20:53,460
was not a joke to my child mind. You know what I was really scared of? I bet

509
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:56,460
you we've never talked about afraid of God because you also grew up kind of

510
00:20:56,460 --> 00:21:02,180
evangelical, right? Were you so afraid of being left behind? Of course, I'm

511
00:21:02,180 --> 00:21:06,820
still afraid of being left behind the most. I feel like the rapture. Yeah,

512
00:21:06,820 --> 00:21:11,820
I've been joking so angry, even thinking about making kids afraid of that.

513
00:21:11,820 --> 00:21:12,820
So crazy.

514
00:21:12,820 --> 00:21:14,820
And do you know about the books Left Behind, of course?

515
00:21:14,820 --> 00:21:15,820
Yeah, dude, and the movies.

516
00:21:15,820 --> 00:21:17,820
I didn't know about those until I met him.

517
00:21:17,820 --> 00:21:19,820
And they had the Left Behind for kids books.

518
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:20,820
That's what I was just going to bring up.

519
00:21:20,820 --> 00:21:21,820
And there was like 30 of them.

520
00:21:21,820 --> 00:21:22,820
Yeah.

521
00:21:22,820 --> 00:21:23,820
And I read them all.

522
00:21:23,820 --> 00:21:25,820
I would sit in the library with no friends.

523
00:21:25,820 --> 00:21:30,820
I would sneak into my little Christian school's library and sit in the corner and read Left Behind.

524
00:21:30,820 --> 00:21:35,820
And I was like, and for those of you who don't know what Left Behind is, I'm sure most of you do,

525
00:21:35,820 --> 00:21:40,540
but it was a narrative fiction, like long series

526
00:21:40,540 --> 00:21:44,060
about these people that were left behind in the rapture,

527
00:21:44,060 --> 00:21:45,140
in the Christian rapture.

528
00:21:45,140 --> 00:21:47,740
- Fictionism, I mean, future history maybe.

529
00:21:47,740 --> 00:21:50,020
- What, they get crazy though with the wars.

530
00:21:50,020 --> 00:21:51,540
- Well, it basically, it's the left,

531
00:21:51,540 --> 00:21:56,100
it's biblical left behind tribulation for one book

532
00:21:56,100 --> 00:21:57,700
and then it's the walking dead.

533
00:21:57,700 --> 00:21:58,540
- It's literally.

534
00:21:58,540 --> 00:22:00,780
- Of like, the war breaks out and people just kill 'em.

535
00:22:00,780 --> 00:22:02,020
- There's zombies in it?

536
00:22:02,020 --> 00:22:03,140
- Oh. - There's crazy shit.

537
00:22:03,140 --> 00:22:08,580
You know what they say in Revelations is that once the Rapture comes, whatever, the Antichrist

538
00:22:08,580 --> 00:22:10,580
is going to rule the world for seven years.

539
00:22:10,580 --> 00:22:11,580
Seven years. Tribulation.

540
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:15,220
And then at the end of that, there's going to be a war that lasts something like 10,000

541
00:22:15,220 --> 00:22:16,220
years.

542
00:22:16,220 --> 00:22:17,220
Too long.

543
00:22:17,220 --> 00:22:22,180
God and Satan fighting. And then everybody gets to go to heaven at the end.

544
00:22:22,180 --> 00:22:23,180
Well, not everybody.

545
00:22:23,180 --> 00:22:24,180
Oh, some people are damned.

546
00:22:24,180 --> 00:22:29,300
Yeah, so I mean there's a bunch of different ways that people think about it, but yeah,

547
00:22:29,300 --> 00:22:34,300
basically there's people, like I remember our pastor said that he was like,

548
00:22:34,300 --> 00:22:38,420
even Christians have to go through all the,

549
00:22:38,420 --> 00:22:41,980
like 10,000 year war and stuff. So he's like, basically there's just,

550
00:22:41,980 --> 00:22:45,700
you're just fucked. It's going to suck. And also Obama's doing it. He's,

551
00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:49,100
so it's going to be here soon. Uh, did, were you,

552
00:22:49,100 --> 00:22:53,260
were your parents ever scared of like microchipping? No, really?

553
00:22:53,260 --> 00:22:57,980
My parents never even talked to me about the rapture. I was the like a fanatic.

554
00:22:58,060 --> 00:23:01,380
Really? Yeah. That's kind of crazy. You were the little religious kid.

555
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:06,180
Yeah. I learned about the ret. Remember in, in 2010,

556
00:23:06,180 --> 00:23:08,820
there is that guy who was saying like,

557
00:23:08,820 --> 00:23:13,820
like there was a huge thing where people were like, yep, 5/12/2010 or something

558
00:23:13,820 --> 00:23:18,420
like that. Or like as if the fucking perfect God almighty would let you know the

559
00:23:18,420 --> 00:23:21,060
date. Do you remember that? There was a, there was a preacher.

560
00:23:21,060 --> 00:23:24,700
He was putting billboards and shit up and he was like, the day is going to,

561
00:23:24,860 --> 00:23:26,620
I did think that was going to happen.

562
00:23:26,620 --> 00:23:28,620
Of course, because it's on a billboard.

563
00:23:28,620 --> 00:23:29,620
What if it does happen?

564
00:23:29,620 --> 00:23:30,620
What are you, 15?

565
00:23:30,620 --> 00:23:33,620
No, I was 12, 13, something like that.

566
00:23:33,620 --> 00:23:37,540
15 would be a little old to be trusting a billboard on something like that.

567
00:23:37,540 --> 00:23:38,540
I would have.

568
00:23:38,540 --> 00:23:44,180
You know what, I was just like, there's that one part of my brain that was like, "Well,

569
00:23:44,180 --> 00:23:46,340
what if it's true?"

570
00:23:46,340 --> 00:23:49,340
I felt like that about 2012, Mayan apocalypse.

571
00:23:49,340 --> 00:23:51,340
Oh, the Mayan and the Kony.

572
00:23:51,340 --> 00:23:52,340
Yes, Kony.

573
00:23:52,340 --> 00:23:53,340
I thought they were tied.

574
00:23:53,340 --> 00:23:57,340
they were tied. I was like, God will not let this stand. He has to destroy the earth.

575
00:23:57,340 --> 00:24:00,340
My first girlfriend broke up with me on the Mayan thing.

576
00:24:00,340 --> 00:24:01,340
So your world did end.

577
00:24:01,340 --> 00:24:07,340
I did. I think I had that in the Twitter drafts when I was 15. I was like, damn.

578
00:24:07,340 --> 00:24:10,340
My world fucking ended in 2012.

579
00:24:10,340 --> 00:24:12,340
Good lord.

580
00:24:12,340 --> 00:24:15,340
That movie, I really liked that movie.

581
00:24:15,340 --> 00:24:16,340
John Cusack.

582
00:24:16,340 --> 00:24:17,340
Yeah. 2012, John Cusack.

583
00:24:17,340 --> 00:24:21,340
Oh, I liked that too. Remember that movie, Two Knowing with Nicolas Cage?

584
00:24:21,340 --> 00:24:22,340
Really cool movie.

585
00:24:22,340 --> 00:24:23,340
I haven't seen that one.

586
00:24:23,340 --> 00:24:24,340
All about apocalypse.

587
00:24:24,340 --> 00:24:26,900
Two freaky ass kids that know all about shit?

588
00:24:26,900 --> 00:24:30,980
Oh, I thought that, yeah, I thought you were talking about Witch Mountain.

589
00:24:30,980 --> 00:24:35,540
Okay, I do have a religious experience that nobody's ever been able to explain to me.

590
00:24:35,540 --> 00:24:37,340
It still scares me thinking about this.

591
00:24:37,340 --> 00:24:44,020
When I was a kid, I had a dream one night, and I had a couple of religious, like God,

592
00:24:44,020 --> 00:24:49,060
I had one dream where I walked out, it's like I was awake in my dream in my house, everybody's

593
00:24:49,060 --> 00:24:51,360
Everybody's asleep. I walked down to the living room

594
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:54,460
and the Holy Spirit came out of the living room,

595
00:24:54,460 --> 00:24:57,260
like coffee table and like came up as like a ghostly figure

596
00:24:57,260 --> 00:24:59,460
and was like, you are going to hell.

597
00:24:59,460 --> 00:25:02,100
I'm like seven.

598
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:02,940
- This was a dream?

599
00:25:02,940 --> 00:25:04,620
- Yeah, yeah, this was a dream.

600
00:25:04,620 --> 00:25:07,860
I had another dream that I'm in our family mania

601
00:25:07,860 --> 00:25:09,740
and I'm looking to the sky.

602
00:25:09,740 --> 00:25:11,180
Remember James and the giant peach?

603
00:25:11,180 --> 00:25:12,000
- Yep.

604
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,380
- Where that cloud turns into a crazy animal.

605
00:25:13,380 --> 00:25:14,220
- The rhino.

606
00:25:14,220 --> 00:25:15,060
- The rhino.

607
00:25:15,060 --> 00:25:16,860
Similar to that, I had a dream that the cloud,

608
00:25:16,860 --> 00:25:18,620
I'm looking at the clouds, they're making crazy shapes.

609
00:25:18,620 --> 00:25:23,360
I'm like eight and the clouds make a fit God's fist and it comes down and

610
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:25,880
punches the shit out of the minivan or rips the top off,

611
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:30,440
blows all my family out and crushes me to death. Fuck man. Jesus Christ.

612
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:32,780
The trifecta is completed with the scariest one,

613
00:25:32,780 --> 00:25:34,960
which I can't explain to this day. Maybe I heard something.

614
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:39,160
I didn't remember it, but I have a dream. I'm eight or nine, whatever.

615
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:44,000
And I know I'm in hell and it's freaky because you know,

616
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:47,680
the way they describe it in school and church was like, it's hot, fiery,

617
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:53,120
ice cold and it was pitch black. I just knew I was in hell. I couldn't see anything, almost

618
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:57,760
blind. And then I'm hearing like the dank drips of hell, whatever. And then I look over

619
00:25:57,760 --> 00:26:02,920
and in the distance is a hooded figure with like a bright glowing head. Okay. And he takes

620
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:09,680
the hood off and I know it's Satan. And he's bright glowing, like crazy, so bright you

621
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:13,060
can't even look at him, like the brightest thing you've ever seen. And that was before

622
00:26:13,060 --> 00:26:17,560
I learned that Satan was a fallen angel. You know, like a bright glowing angel.

623
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:18,840
So you were touched?

624
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:27,080
I don't know. All this shit made me so fanatical about God and being like, I didn't even, heaven

625
00:26:27,080 --> 00:26:30,620
sounded like shit to me because of what you do in worship all the time. And worship is

626
00:26:30,620 --> 00:26:31,620
so fucking boring.

627
00:26:31,620 --> 00:26:32,620
It is really boring.

628
00:26:32,620 --> 00:26:35,880
But anyways.

629
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:37,480
That idea of hell is kind of cool though.

630
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:38,480
That is dark.

631
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:39,480
That is cold.

632
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:40,480
Well no, that's hell froze over.

633
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:41,480
Hell froze over.

634
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:42,480
Oh yeah, true.

635
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:44,680
In some of the ancient descriptions they talk about hell being cold.

636
00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:45,680
And you knew that already.

637
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:48,760
No, I'd never heard of that. That's why I was like, I don't know why.

638
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:49,760
That sounds like...

639
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:55,400
I had a similar dream as a child where me and my dad, we made a snowman outside and it chased

640
00:26:55,400 --> 00:27:00,600
us and we were in a monster truck. And that stuck with me. I swear to God, me and my dad,

641
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:03,200
I talk about it every single time I see him.

642
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:05,160
My older brother has a dream like that too.

643
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:07,680
It's just one of those dreams that just sticks with you for the rest of your life.

644
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:12,440
It's one that fucks up your brain so much that it's like, oh, this is like, I don't know

645
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:15,780
but I'm going to have to talk about this all the time. My older brother has this

646
00:27:15,780 --> 00:27:21,620
dream he only referred to as the poop dream where he's in on an operating table

647
00:27:21,620 --> 00:27:22,700
with his butt up.

648
00:27:22,700 --> 00:27:27,740
They take the poop out of him? No, the doctor comes in, he says, he told me,

649
00:27:27,740 --> 00:27:31,340
he's like, the whole room is lit green like Fight Club

650
00:27:31,340 --> 00:27:37,320
and he's on an operating table and a doctor comes in and cuts his butt off and

651
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:38,480
it just shoots poop out.

652
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:41,680
That doctor is a... He, quack.

653
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:49,840
He woke up from the poop dream just screaming.

654
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:53,040
And I guess my mom, it happened like a few times.

655
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:55,960
And he woke up, my mom like came into the room like, "What?

656
00:27:55,960 --> 00:27:56,200
What?

657
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:56,800
What's going on?"

658
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:58,600
He's just in the poop dream.

659
00:27:58,600 --> 00:28:00,320
I had a scary dream last night.

660
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:03,320
I dreamed that I got addicted to vaping again.

661
00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:04,800
And that was my entire dream.

662
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:05,800
I never knew that you were addicted to vaping.

663
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:07,520
I was a vaper for quite some time.

664
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:08,520
Yeah, we all were.

665
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:09,520
Yeah.

666
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:10,640
And the Juul came out.

667
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:13,140
I never, the Jewel was a little past my...

668
00:28:13,140 --> 00:28:15,140
Yeah, past your nicotine prime.

669
00:28:15,140 --> 00:28:18,140
It was great because you could sneak it into music festivals.

670
00:28:18,140 --> 00:28:19,140
Yeah.

671
00:28:19,140 --> 00:28:21,140
They're outside, motherfucker. I'll smoke whatever I want.

672
00:28:21,140 --> 00:28:27,140
The fucking Boston Calling, they were super, because it was on the Harvard campus for the first time ever,

673
00:28:27,140 --> 00:28:30,140
when I like got, I spent my student loan refund on it.

674
00:28:30,140 --> 00:28:32,140
And they were yelling at you about vaping?

675
00:28:32,140 --> 00:28:37,640
Well, I wanted to sneak cigarettes in, and I had them in my, I had them in a plastic bag on my dick.

676
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:39,640
That is some terrorist shit.

677
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:43,320
Yeah. I could have snuck. That is seriously terroristic. I could have

678
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:46,480
brought anything in that cigarette pack. Yeah, the cigs on the dick. Mm-hmm.

679
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:48,400
They were in a plastic bag.

680
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:54,400
Yeah, that is kinda nasty. They didn't get all broken. Not by your dick.

681
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:59,280
But then the jewel came out. Not by yours. No, mine's not even touching 'em.

682
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:02,280
Something about that story, I was telling Jack about this yesterday, and maybe

683
00:29:02,280 --> 00:29:05,840
you heard it too, that I... Something about recently, people have been telling

684
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:10,340
little anecdotes that have not, they're not emotional at all, but they make me

685
00:29:10,340 --> 00:29:14,220
almost cry. And something about that story made me tear up for some reason.

686
00:29:14,220 --> 00:29:18,340
You're thinking about my addiction to cigarettes? I think I have a brain tumor. Yeah. I think I

687
00:29:18,340 --> 00:29:22,460
have some kind of giantly massive brain tumor that has filled up my entire head

688
00:29:22,460 --> 00:29:26,460
and it's pushing out tears. No, you're being, you're just an empath and you're

689
00:29:26,460 --> 00:29:33,460
thinking about like me being 19 years old addicted to cigarettes. No, I was telling Jack yesterday that somebody told me recently, they were like, they said

690
00:29:33,460 --> 00:29:37,100
that something they were like, did you know that this one song was not like it

691
00:29:37,100 --> 00:29:41,660
wasn't it was originally written for this movie? And I was like, really? Like I

692
00:29:41,660 --> 00:29:45,860
said, I like sort of like tearing up for some reason. Yeah, something is wrong

693
00:29:45,860 --> 00:29:48,500
with me and I need to go to the hospital today. Are you taking like new

694
00:29:48,500 --> 00:29:50,980
medication? No, I don't take any medication at all.

695
00:29:50,980 --> 00:29:54,180
Well, I take a bunch of different routes that are

696
00:29:54,180 --> 00:29:56,340
that too.

697
00:29:56,340 --> 00:30:01,700
Yeah, I was thinking today that this is kind of a, I was, I didn't know if maybe

698
00:30:01,700 --> 00:30:06,500
this three person crew, all of us would roll in like super hungover, because I

699
00:30:06,500 --> 00:30:09,780
feel like this is the hungover crew. 'Cause we like to get all twisted. 'Cause

700
00:30:09,780 --> 00:30:14,140
sometimes, you're almost always a yes. I'm a maybe and Cameron's a never. And

701
00:30:14,140 --> 00:30:17,940
I'm a maybe. And you're a maybe, yeah. So it's two maybes now. Two maybes and a

702
00:30:17,940 --> 00:30:22,700
yes. And guess what, not hungover. Wow. What'd you do last night? It was May the

703
00:30:22,700 --> 00:30:26,420
4th. So you were drinking some... Did you watch Star Wars? So you went to the

704
00:30:26,420 --> 00:30:31,340
cantina. I did, I drank some blue milk. Wow. Blue milk from where? From Star

705
00:30:31,340 --> 00:30:36,040
course. Did you really know I wish you had done that. I did have a course

706
00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:39,400
banquet though. I watched ours. I made pork chops. You watched

707
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:42,600
pork chops and phantom menace.

708
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:48,380
You watch Phantom Man. I watched a new hope. I watched a new hope two nights

709
00:30:48,380 --> 00:30:52,380
ago and I watched Phantom Menace last night. I just downloaded a Star Wars

710
00:30:52,380 --> 00:30:58,500
ebook called the Darth Bane trilogy. Oh yeah, I know about him. Darth Bane.

711
00:30:58,500 --> 00:31:00,220
Yeah, that's the guy

712
00:31:00,220 --> 00:31:03,880
- Yeah, he's the one. - There's not a lot of nice Darths in

713
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:06,020
- No. - No, he's the protagonist of the

714
00:31:06,020 --> 00:31:07,900
- Darth basically means bad in

715
00:31:07,900 --> 00:31:09,300
- Darth means father. - Star Wars.

716
00:31:09,300 --> 00:31:12,080
- Oh no, Vader means father. - Darth means dark.

717
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:14,380
- Oh, dark father. - Darth means dark?

718
00:31:14,380 --> 00:31:16,300
- Yeah, Darth, I think Darth is Dutch.

719
00:31:16,300 --> 00:31:18,140
- Super Darth in here. - For dark.

720
00:31:18,140 --> 00:31:20,940
- It's dark in here? Or Darth in here?

721
00:31:20,940 --> 00:31:24,380
Darth means, in what language? - Darth in here, Darth in here.

722
00:31:24,380 --> 00:31:25,600
- Oh shit. - Darth.

723
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:28,660
- But what language is this where Vader is father?

724
00:31:28,660 --> 00:31:31,620
- writer. - Writer is father in German, so it's dark.

725
00:31:31,620 --> 00:31:33,700
Oh, because the Imperials or the Nazi.

726
00:31:33,700 --> 00:31:35,860
- Yep. - Okay. That makes more sense.

727
00:31:35,860 --> 00:31:39,700
- Whoa. - Whoa.

728
00:31:39,700 --> 00:31:46,100
Wait.

729
00:31:46,100 --> 00:31:52,340
God damn.

730
00:31:52,340 --> 00:31:58,340
[Humming]

731
00:31:58,340 --> 00:32:00,340
George Lucas Productions

732
00:32:00,340 --> 00:32:02,340
That was insane dude

733
00:32:02,340 --> 00:32:04,340
[Laughter]

734
00:32:04,340 --> 00:32:06,340
The end of every Star Wars movie

735
00:32:06,340 --> 00:32:08,340
The end of every Star Wars movie

736
00:32:08,340 --> 00:32:10,340
George Lucas Productions

737
00:32:10,340 --> 00:32:12,340
[Laughter]

738
00:32:12,340 --> 00:32:14,340
George Lucas Productions

739
00:32:14,340 --> 00:32:16,340
That was fucking fire man

740
00:32:16,340 --> 00:32:18,340
I heard some good ass news

741
00:32:18,340 --> 00:32:20,340
I watched Phantom Menace last night

742
00:32:20,340 --> 00:32:23,500
George Lucas might be at the helm of some new Star Wars movie.

743
00:32:23,500 --> 00:32:24,000
Really?

744
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:24,500
Really?

745
00:32:24,500 --> 00:32:25,500
That could be cool.

746
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:28,300
He's too old. Doesn't he just fucking roll around and chill now?

747
00:32:28,300 --> 00:32:30,300
He just kind of rolls around.

748
00:32:30,300 --> 00:32:31,800
He's got that Skywalker ranch.

749
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:32,800
He's cool, man.

750
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:33,800
He's sick.

751
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:34,800
He really is cool.

752
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:35,800
Have you heard that...

753
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:37,800
He's so much cooler than Spielberg.

754
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:40,800
Spielberg's such an old, dorky loser.

755
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:41,800
Unless he wants to work with me.

756
00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:43,800
Spielberg does suck.

757
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:47,300
Yeah, and then he does want to come and produce a movie with us.

758
00:32:47,300 --> 00:32:48,800
A pot of bottles feature.

759
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:56,800
Maybe put us in Indiana Jones or something. I would love oh my god three the three triple short round situation

760
00:32:56,800 --> 00:33:01,480
Yeah, yeah, three little kids that and they're played by us. Yeah, they're like you know, and you know

761
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:06,740
He loves digital de-aging technology de-ages us into children and we're walking around like Indy

762
00:33:06,740 --> 00:33:09,180
Are you sure you want to do this and he's like?

763
00:33:09,180 --> 00:33:10,780
- Oh, make it the kid's voice.

764
00:33:10,780 --> 00:33:11,780
- Yeah, yeah.

765
00:33:11,780 --> 00:33:15,280
- We're like, "Indiana Jones, please, please,

766
00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:20,280
I don't want to go into the cave, I want to go to school."

767
00:33:20,280 --> 00:33:22,520
(laughing)

768
00:33:22,520 --> 00:33:26,520
- And he'd say, "You fucking stupid fucking kid,

769
00:33:26,520 --> 00:33:28,380
I'm gonna talk to the other two."

770
00:33:28,380 --> 00:33:32,300
And then Patrick, you would go, you would go like,

771
00:33:32,300 --> 00:33:33,620
well, basically you would go--

772
00:33:33,620 --> 00:33:34,860
- Do I have the voice on?

773
00:33:34,860 --> 00:33:36,580
- Okay, there.

774
00:33:36,580 --> 00:33:41,180
Oh Indy, do we have to go into the cave?

775
00:33:41,180 --> 00:33:42,680
You gotta go into the cave kid.

776
00:33:42,680 --> 00:33:46,380
I don't wanna go into the cave, I wanna go to the ice cream parlor.

777
00:33:46,380 --> 00:33:50,180
And then Eric you would also be in this movie and you would basically go...

778
00:33:50,180 --> 00:33:53,180
Hey yo Indiana Jones.

779
00:33:53,180 --> 00:33:56,180
(Laughter)

780
00:33:56,180 --> 00:34:00,180
I love your shit man, respect.

781
00:34:00,180 --> 00:34:06,180
(Laughter)

782
00:34:06,180 --> 00:34:07,680
Okay, I like this

783
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:11,480
that

784
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:17,780
that is funny to me. Everything I know

785
00:34:17,780 --> 00:34:23,580
so good. Yeah, these chipmunks had the right idea man. Yeah. Who do you think

786
00:34:23,580 --> 00:34:28,080
was the first guy? First of all, who listen who made that song the first time

787
00:34:28,080 --> 00:34:31,480
I think it was a voice and then who said that sounds like a fucking chip was

788
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:33,680
- The A-Kon? No. - No!

789
00:34:33,680 --> 00:34:35,680
- The Chipmunks were from like the 60s. - He just got the high voice.

790
00:34:35,680 --> 00:34:38,180
- He stole from the Chipmunks. - Yeah.

791
00:34:38,180 --> 00:34:40,180
- A-Kon did. - He stole Lonely from the Chipmunks.

792
00:34:40,180 --> 00:34:42,180
- Yeah. - But yeah, like...

793
00:34:42,180 --> 00:34:45,680
Who was the first guy that was like, "It might sound good to do a high voice"?

794
00:34:45,680 --> 00:34:47,680
'Cause I would not think that it would.

795
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:50,680
I think it was... I think somebody dropped a soda onto the mixer.

796
00:34:50,680 --> 00:34:55,680
Maybe it was like ancient Greek theater where people couldn't play...

797
00:34:55,680 --> 00:34:58,180
Or that women couldn't be a part of the thing, so...

798
00:34:58,180 --> 00:35:00,180
I think Helium had to be involved.

799
00:35:00,180 --> 00:35:02,180
Definitely. Oh, that's what it was.

800
00:35:02,180 --> 00:35:04,180
Helium for sure had to be involved.

801
00:35:04,180 --> 00:35:06,180
They were like, "Well, what if we

802
00:35:06,180 --> 00:35:08,180
go into the studio, we pump the

803
00:35:08,180 --> 00:35:10,180
studio full of helium?" I think the first

804
00:35:10,180 --> 00:35:12,180
attempt as the chipmunks... The first time was in the 1940s

805
00:35:12,180 --> 00:35:14,180
they hit the helium balloon and somebody said

806
00:35:14,180 --> 00:35:16,180
"There is a house

807
00:35:16,180 --> 00:35:18,180
in New Orleans!"

808
00:35:18,180 --> 00:35:20,180
And they were like, "That's gonna be huge."

809
00:35:20,180 --> 00:35:22,180
The greatest song in the world. And by the way, that sounds like

810
00:35:22,180 --> 00:35:24,180
a chipmunk to me. Yeah. I hope I'm

811
00:35:24,180 --> 00:35:26,180
not saying anything controversial because I don't mean

812
00:35:26,180 --> 00:35:28,180
to be bad, but I think it was probably back

813
00:35:28,180 --> 00:35:31,820
Back in the Greek days, because a lot of the performers, some of the performers were eunuchs.

814
00:35:31,820 --> 00:35:32,820
True.

815
00:35:32,820 --> 00:35:35,900
And I think, and maybe that was happened to them before their hormones.

816
00:35:35,900 --> 00:35:36,900
Oh, that's a good point.

817
00:35:36,900 --> 00:35:37,900
Maybe that's it back in the day.

818
00:35:37,900 --> 00:35:38,900
So when you get your shit sniffed.

819
00:35:38,900 --> 00:35:39,900
You turn into a chipmunk.

820
00:35:39,900 --> 00:35:40,900
Yeah.

821
00:35:40,900 --> 00:35:41,900
Oh my, chipmunks, what do they love?

822
00:35:41,900 --> 00:35:42,900
Nuts.

823
00:35:42,900 --> 00:35:43,900
And you don't got none.

824
00:35:43,900 --> 00:35:44,900
You got none.

825
00:35:44,900 --> 00:35:45,900
Oh my God.

826
00:35:45,900 --> 00:35:46,900
So your voice gets high because you're constantly looking for your nuts.

827
00:35:46,900 --> 00:35:47,900
I never understood the eunuch thing.

828
00:35:47,900 --> 00:35:48,900
Remember Varys from Game of Thrones?

829
00:35:48,900 --> 00:35:49,900
I understood him.

830
00:35:49,900 --> 00:35:50,900
Varys.

831
00:35:50,900 --> 00:35:51,900
Varys.

832
00:35:51,900 --> 00:35:52,900
Varys.

833
00:35:52,900 --> 00:35:53,900
Varys.

834
00:35:53,900 --> 00:35:54,900
Varys.

835
00:35:54,900 --> 00:35:55,900
Varys.

836
00:35:55,900 --> 00:35:56,900
Varys.

837
00:35:56,900 --> 00:35:57,900
Varys.

838
00:35:57,900 --> 00:36:03,880
him. But he was kind of like, what about having your nuts chopped off makes you mysterious

839
00:36:03,880 --> 00:36:04,940
and snake-like?

840
00:36:04,940 --> 00:36:07,620
I think he probably had a lot of rage about what happened to him.

841
00:36:07,620 --> 00:36:09,420
So he said, "I'm going to be a backstabber."

842
00:36:09,420 --> 00:36:13,220
Maybe. And he's a gossip. He's a rotten gossip, Pat.

843
00:36:13,220 --> 00:36:14,220
He's got no balls.

844
00:36:14,220 --> 00:36:18,300
You don't have the nuts to say it to my face. That's basically what they're saying.

845
00:36:18,300 --> 00:36:20,780
Did they ever say that in the show?

846
00:36:20,780 --> 00:36:22,980
That's what I would say if I was Jon Stark or Snow.

847
00:36:22,980 --> 00:36:23,980
Jon Snow, Jon Stark.

848
00:36:23,980 --> 00:36:24,980
I don't know the difference.

849
00:36:24,980 --> 00:36:25,980
Jon Stark.

850
00:36:25,980 --> 00:36:26,980
That's Tony Stark.

851
00:36:26,980 --> 00:36:30,460
I was Tony Stark and if Tony Stark was in Game of Thrones, those dragons have a

852
00:36:30,460 --> 00:36:34,460
different idea. If Tony Stark was in Game of Thrones, I'll tell you what, that game

853
00:36:34,460 --> 00:36:37,980
would have been one episode. Yeah, because they're all playing because the

854
00:36:37,980 --> 00:36:41,380
game is they're playing checkers. Tony Stark's playing chess. Chess, he's got

855
00:36:41,380 --> 00:36:44,620
the crazy computers. Exactly. And he would be the only millionaire in the time.

856
00:36:44,620 --> 00:36:46,860
That's a good point.

857
00:36:46,860 --> 00:36:54,220
Yeah, that's a really good point. Yeah. But I think if you get your or what was

858
00:36:54,220 --> 00:36:57,020
was the reason why they would do eunuchs? Is it because I thought it was

859
00:36:57,020 --> 00:37:01,820
funny? It was for high singing voices. Was it? I would be so pissed off

860
00:37:01,820 --> 00:37:04,780
if somebody did that shit to me. I would never sing, I would never

861
00:37:04,780 --> 00:37:08,620
reveal my voice. I think it was for like servants to make them...

862
00:37:08,620 --> 00:37:11,940
I mean, I don't know which cultures, but for certain cultures, it was

863
00:37:11,940 --> 00:37:14,900
like for servants to make them non threatening to like... Oh, it's like

864
00:37:14,900 --> 00:37:18,940
neutering a dog. Yeah, yeah, I think so. Oh, okay. So it was not

865
00:37:18,940 --> 00:37:22,340
not chill. I feel like that would make me even more threatening. I'd be

866
00:37:22,340 --> 00:37:25,500
throwing fists back and forth, that'd be poisoning people's shit.

867
00:37:25,500 --> 00:37:28,100
Isn't that what happens in Game of Thrones?

868
00:37:28,100 --> 00:37:29,100
Oh, that's exactly right.

869
00:37:29,100 --> 00:37:30,100
My context clues here.

870
00:37:30,100 --> 00:37:33,420
Somebody handed me a drink at a thing recently.

871
00:37:33,420 --> 00:37:36,300
Was it that party we were at on Monday or Tuesday?

872
00:37:36,300 --> 00:37:38,460
No, it wasn't that, but that would have been a similar scenario.

873
00:37:38,460 --> 00:37:39,460
We were turning up.

874
00:37:39,460 --> 00:37:41,180
We were going crazy at about three beers.

875
00:37:41,180 --> 00:37:43,420
Me and Eric were daggering on the dance floor.

876
00:37:43,420 --> 00:37:45,100
You were daggering him like in Jamaica?

877
00:37:45,100 --> 00:37:46,100
Yep.

878
00:37:46,100 --> 00:37:47,100
Wow.

879
00:37:47,100 --> 00:37:50,540
But someone handed me a drink and it seemed like a nice guy and I held it and he's like,

880
00:37:50,540 --> 00:37:53,040
"Seriously dude, don't worry about it. I didn't do anything to it."

881
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:54,040
He said that?

882
00:37:54,040 --> 00:37:56,040
And I took it and I was like, "I'm sure he's a nice guy.

883
00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:58,040
Whatever I get in the bathroom, pour it right in the drain."

884
00:37:58,040 --> 00:37:59,040
Wow.

885
00:37:59,040 --> 00:37:59,540
Yeah.

886
00:37:59,540 --> 00:38:03,040
That would also be maybe the worst thing you could say to somebody

887
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:05,040
right before you drunk them with the drink.

888
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:06,040
You don't say that.

889
00:38:06,040 --> 00:38:07,540
It's all good, man. I didn't put anything in there.

890
00:38:07,540 --> 00:38:08,540
Yeah.

891
00:38:08,540 --> 00:38:13,040
I guess you'd say that to be funny about it, but even then,

892
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:14,040
even if you're joking about it...

893
00:38:14,040 --> 00:38:17,040
You don't know if this guy's doing double reverse psychology on you or something.

894
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:21,200
There's a level of trust that you have to have with that person for that joke to work.

895
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:22,640
Did you know that guy at all?

896
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:23,600
Never met him.

897
00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:24,640
Really?

898
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:24,800
Was it the bartender?

899
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:26,400
If it was your best friend?

900
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:27,840
Yeah, it was my best friend.

901
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:31,600
If it was your best friend who gave you that and said that, that'd be fine.

902
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:34,560
I'd be like, "Oh, he's pretending to roofie me."

903
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:35,440
Yeah, I don't really.

904
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:36,720
And I don't play those type of games.

905
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:38,720
Yeah, that's not cool.

906
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:41,920
Yeah, by the way, I'm going to shoot you when you drink this drink.

907
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:43,280
That's not cool to say.

908
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:45,040
What does that red flashing light mean?

909
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:46,760
That it's recording I think.

910
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:48,760
That it's recording. I'll double check.

911
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:49,760
I hope.

912
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:52,760
Lonely.

913
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:54,760
It's so lonely.

914
00:38:54,760 --> 00:38:56,760
Does that sound like the chipmunk from that song?

915
00:38:56,760 --> 00:38:57,760
It kind of does.

916
00:38:57,760 --> 00:38:58,760
Lonely.

917
00:38:58,760 --> 00:39:00,760
Did you press it?

918
00:39:00,760 --> 00:39:01,760
Nope.

919
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:03,760
It sounded so real.

920
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:05,760
That was just me. That was my stuff.

921
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:06,760
What's that?

922
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:07,760
You saved the day.

923
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:08,760
Did I really?

924
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:10,760
Yeah, it was going to the bandmate who's going to die.

925
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:11,760
Whoa.

926
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:13,760
Because I plugged it into the wrong hole.

927
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:17,640
I plugged it into the wrong input hole.

928
00:39:17,640 --> 00:39:18,640
Eww.

929
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:20,960
I told you I've been around cameras before.

930
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:21,960
It kind of seems like it.

931
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:24,040
I didn't realize that you were that kind of...

932
00:39:24,040 --> 00:39:25,640
What was that laugh?

933
00:39:25,640 --> 00:39:26,640
That scared me a little.

934
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:35,960
Do you think that you are on the precipice of a giant voice acting role?

935
00:39:35,960 --> 00:39:36,960
Of course.

936
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:38,840
I'm trying to break into that industry.

937
00:39:38,840 --> 00:39:40,720
Maybe new, like Little Mermaid.

938
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:41,720
I think movie.

939
00:39:41,720 --> 00:39:42,720
You heard that thing I just did?

940
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:43,720
What?

941
00:39:43,720 --> 00:39:44,720
The chipmunk that I did?

942
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:46,860
- Oh, did you hear what Pat did?

943
00:39:46,860 --> 00:39:47,700
- No, you never said it. - No, do it again.

944
00:39:47,700 --> 00:39:48,540
- Okay, God.

945
00:39:48,540 --> 00:39:50,200
(imitates car engine)

946
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:52,160
- Oh, so you Meatwad.

947
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:53,920
- Yeah, basically I have that voice

948
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:58,440
and then my normal voice, and that's gonna get,

949
00:39:58,440 --> 00:40:01,280
that's my whole reel right now, my voice acting reel.

950
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:02,600
- You wrote a show that's you and Meatwad

951
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:04,240
talking to each other? - Yeah.

952
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:07,040
- Doing like a comedians in cars thing with Meatwad?

953
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:09,600
- Why was he never on that show?

954
00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:11,680
- Why was Meatwad never on comedians in cars?

955
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:13,200
- I don't know who this Meatwad.

956
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:15,200
You never seen Aqua Teen Hunger Force?

957
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:17,200
Oh, he's the hamburger.

958
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:19,200
He must have, he went to bed early.

959
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:21,200
He's not a hamburger.

960
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:24,200
I don't think I actually ever saw Aqua Teen Hunger Force.

961
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:26,200
You're missing out on some seriously good shit.

962
00:40:26,200 --> 00:40:28,200
And that by the way seems like a little before your guys' time.

963
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:30,200
You don't know anything about my age.

964
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:31,200
Yeah.

965
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:32,200
Well, I guess not.

966
00:40:32,200 --> 00:40:34,200
Because I was born in the wrong generation.

967
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:35,200
Me too.

968
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:36,200
I should have been born in 1994.

969
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:38,200
I think that people have said that to me my entire life.

970
00:40:38,200 --> 00:40:42,200
Everyone thinks that I'm 30 because of my hair.

971
00:40:42,200 --> 00:40:44,600
The first time we met I thought you were my age.

972
00:40:44,600 --> 00:40:45,600
Yeah.

973
00:40:45,600 --> 00:40:47,720
And then, but now I know I can see you.

974
00:40:47,720 --> 00:40:48,720
He's younger than me.

975
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:49,720
How old are you?

976
00:40:49,720 --> 00:40:50,720
25.

977
00:40:50,720 --> 00:40:51,720
Bastard.

978
00:40:51,720 --> 00:40:52,720
25, yeah.

979
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:54,680
For just a few short more months and then you join me up in the upper 20s.

980
00:40:54,680 --> 00:40:55,680
I'll use my health insurance.

981
00:40:55,680 --> 00:40:56,680
The high 20s.

982
00:40:56,680 --> 00:40:57,680
My high health insurance.

983
00:40:57,680 --> 00:41:00,320
Did I tell you my plan for my birthday?

984
00:41:00,320 --> 00:41:04,760
I'm not actually going to go through with it, but I kind of want to.

985
00:41:04,760 --> 00:41:05,760
Suicide.

986
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:08,160
What is it, dude?

987
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:09,900
It's technically suicide.

988
00:41:09,900 --> 00:41:10,900
What is it?

989
00:41:10,900 --> 00:41:16,500
I'm going to spend the day of my, a month before, just in case something really bad happens

990
00:41:16,500 --> 00:41:20,960
when I do this, whole day, jackass stunts.

991
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:21,960
On your birthday.

992
00:41:21,960 --> 00:41:27,380
All day, a month before, just in case I get severely injured and I need a month to recover.

993
00:41:27,380 --> 00:41:28,380
Oh, I see.

994
00:41:28,380 --> 00:41:29,580
Yeah, that is social suicide.

995
00:41:29,580 --> 00:41:33,780
What about the continued care though, because, tell you what, some of those injuries will

996
00:41:33,780 --> 00:41:35,380
keep you in the hospital for days.

997
00:41:35,380 --> 00:41:38,100
Yeah, that's why I'm doing it a month before.

998
00:41:38,100 --> 00:41:41,300
Okay, so what kind of jackass stunt would you do though?

999
00:41:41,300 --> 00:41:43,300
Jump off a building with an umbrella.

1000
00:41:43,300 --> 00:41:48,300
Dan literally talked about doing that and he broke both of his legs.

1001
00:41:48,300 --> 00:41:49,300
Oh yeah.

1002
00:41:49,300 --> 00:41:51,300
Well you put me on the spot.

1003
00:41:51,300 --> 00:41:52,300
I didn't have all the explaining.

1004
00:41:52,300 --> 00:41:55,300
So you just stole his idea that he got hurt from doing?

1005
00:41:55,300 --> 00:41:56,300
I could.

1006
00:41:56,300 --> 00:41:59,300
Why would you do the exact same one that he did?

1007
00:41:59,300 --> 00:42:00,300
That's one that Bam did.

1008
00:42:00,300 --> 00:42:02,300
Okay, well he did it.

1009
00:42:02,300 --> 00:42:04,300
You need a new one.

1010
00:42:04,300 --> 00:42:07,300
Okay, jump from a building onto a tree.

1011
00:42:07,300 --> 00:42:11,740
I can't see you're stealing all of your jackass, you don't have a jackass brain.

1012
00:42:11,740 --> 00:42:12,240
I don't.

1013
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:13,120
I have one right now.

1014
00:42:13,120 --> 00:42:15,520
Cover myself in hot oil.

1015
00:42:15,520 --> 00:42:16,520
Yeah.

1016
00:42:16,520 --> 00:42:17,680
You know who did that?

1017
00:42:17,680 --> 00:42:18,680
The amazing atheist.

1018
00:42:18,680 --> 00:42:19,680
Hot oil?

1019
00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:20,680
Burning oil?

1020
00:42:20,680 --> 00:42:22,520
Okay, hot water, fuck you.

1021
00:42:22,520 --> 00:42:25,320
Amazing atheist put hot oil on his penis.

1022
00:42:25,320 --> 00:42:29,600
Get pretty close to a volcano to the point where maybe my hand catches on fire.

1023
00:42:29,600 --> 00:42:30,600
Did you know, I could do jackass things.

1024
00:42:30,600 --> 00:42:35,040
Did you hear about the couple that died 40 years ago and they made a movie about them?

1025
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:39,780
There was that girl that was on TikTok who went on a cruise and they did a

1026
00:42:39,780 --> 00:42:42,480
destination expedition to a volcano.

1027
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:45,840
No, but in the lava didn't even hit him, but there was a group of people there

1028
00:42:45,840 --> 00:42:50,780
and the gas was so hot that it burned everybody to death except for her.

1029
00:42:50,780 --> 00:42:51,780
What?

1030
00:42:51,780 --> 00:42:53,780
And so she's in the hospital. She's with like, you know,

1031
00:42:53,780 --> 00:42:55,280
Why did they get so close?

1032
00:42:55,280 --> 00:42:56,780
They weren't even that close.

1033
00:42:56,780 --> 00:42:57,780
On a volcano?

1034
00:42:57,780 --> 00:43:00,780
Yeah, yeah. And the gas just bodied them.

1035
00:43:00,780 --> 00:43:02,780
Well, okay. For my birthday.

1036
00:43:02,780 --> 00:43:03,780
You want to do that?

1037
00:43:03,780 --> 00:43:08,780
I do not. I do not fuck with

1038
00:43:08,780 --> 00:43:12,780
lava or magma. I could do those.

1039
00:43:12,780 --> 00:43:16,780
Again, that's from Jackass. You do not have a creative

1040
00:43:16,780 --> 00:43:20,780
self-pranking brain. That's good though, lean into it.

1041
00:43:20,780 --> 00:43:24,780
I don't either. Well, that's the thing. I think it's more of a tribute to

1042
00:43:24,780 --> 00:43:28,780
Jackass. Who gives a fuck about that, dude? Do a

1043
00:43:28,780 --> 00:43:32,780
new thing. If you ask me, they've been doing tributes to themselves every fucking

1044
00:43:32,780 --> 00:43:36,800
movie since the first. Yeah, it's enough. Yeah, come up with some new shit. I went

1045
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:41,100
off on Steve on our podcast. What do you say? Well, I think he's milking the

1046
00:43:41,100 --> 00:43:46,660
BAM Margera mental health crisis. And also, yeah, if you own damn ass. Yeah,

1047
00:43:46,660 --> 00:43:52,260
busted podcast. I kind of agree. But also on Steve. Oh, if you have been sober

1048
00:43:52,260 --> 00:43:57,180
more than one year, then I'm done hearing about it. Shut the fuck up.

1049
00:43:57,180 --> 00:44:02,460
That's enough. Oh, I had to, I was almost died and I have all these holes in my...

1050
00:44:02,460 --> 00:44:05,020
I was addicted to Whippets. Yeah, I was fucking addicted to Whippets.

1051
00:44:05,020 --> 00:44:11,180
Shut the fuck up, dude. Get a job. You do your podcast from a van. Shut up, bro.

1052
00:44:11,180 --> 00:44:13,900
He started his own skateboard company, made himself pro.

1053
00:44:13,900 --> 00:44:19,460
That's fake. You can't do that. That's, you are cheating. That's giantly cheating.

1054
00:44:19,460 --> 00:44:23,860
Yep. And I also, you were funnier when you were on all the drugs, buddy.

1055
00:44:23,860 --> 00:44:26,780
Get back on the Whippets. Get back on the whipped cream.

1056
00:44:26,780 --> 00:44:31,220
also stop doing stand-up comedy right now because it's actually an art form that a lot of people

1057
00:44:31,220 --> 00:44:37,860
work their entire lives at and you are parlaying your fame to become a regular at the comedy

1058
00:44:37,860 --> 00:44:39,860
store which is some people's number one dream.

1059
00:44:39,860 --> 00:44:44,580
Your closing joke, Steve-O, is that you get tased or punched by the biggest guy in the

1060
00:44:44,580 --> 00:44:46,700
crowd. What is that?

1061
00:44:46,700 --> 00:44:49,980
Yeah. How do you know that? You've seen him live?

1062
00:44:49,980 --> 00:44:56,340
I've seen him on the Charlie Sheen roast where he says he couldn't think of a closer so then

1063
00:44:56,340 --> 00:44:58,480
and he had Mike Tyson punch him in the face.

1064
00:44:58,480 --> 00:45:00,280
- I don't think he still does that.

1065
00:45:00,280 --> 00:45:01,400
I think he did that for that.

1066
00:45:01,400 --> 00:45:04,240
- Yeah, well then he also, I think his final--

1067
00:45:04,240 --> 00:45:05,320
- You thought that was his big--

1068
00:45:05,320 --> 00:45:08,320
- No, his final stand up thing, his special,

1069
00:45:08,320 --> 00:45:10,280
is him doing a stunt at the end.

1070
00:45:10,280 --> 00:45:11,120
- Oh, okay.

1071
00:45:11,120 --> 00:45:13,120
- Oh, like stapling his balls to his legs.

1072
00:45:13,120 --> 00:45:13,960
- Yeah.

1073
00:45:13,960 --> 00:45:14,780
- I haven't seen his special.

1074
00:45:14,780 --> 00:45:16,960
- One time, I used to, I fake doing whip-its one time

1075
00:45:16,960 --> 00:45:17,800
at work.

1076
00:45:17,800 --> 00:45:18,620
- Really?

1077
00:45:18,620 --> 00:45:19,460
- Everybody else was doing it, they're like,

1078
00:45:19,460 --> 00:45:20,280
"Eric, do it, do it, do it."

1079
00:45:20,280 --> 00:45:21,120
- At work?

1080
00:45:21,120 --> 00:45:22,640
- Yeah, 'cause we had whipped cream canisters.

1081
00:45:22,640 --> 00:45:23,480
- What job?

1082
00:45:23,480 --> 00:45:24,560
- I worked at a deli.

1083
00:45:24,560 --> 00:45:25,400
- Oh, yeah.

1084
00:45:25,400 --> 00:45:29,540
Yeah, whipped cream canisters, everybody was doing it and so I like faked and

1085
00:45:29,540 --> 00:45:32,660
then I pretended to be so out of it. Do your impression of it right now.

1086
00:45:32,660 --> 00:45:33,160
Oh,

1087
00:45:33,160 --> 00:45:43,160
it's just faking it.

1088
00:45:43,160 --> 00:45:46,160
Like coming. Everybody else is like, "Whoa."

1089
00:45:52,060 --> 00:45:57,520
Wow yeah, let's do it again. Yeah, give me another one. I'll manager from

1090
00:45:57,520 --> 00:46:00,900
that job, Jody Jody, you're so mean. Whoa,

1091
00:46:00,900 --> 00:46:05,140
come on now about 10 years ago now, but I hope you don't gotta be so

1092
00:46:05,140 --> 00:46:09,420
mean. Why you gotta be so rude? I don't know.

1093
00:46:09,420 --> 00:46:14,540

1099
00:46:20,640 --> 00:46:23,260
- Why did this shit make your voice sound so good?

1100
00:46:23,260 --> 00:46:24,800
- I know, the singing voice?

1101
00:46:24,800 --> 00:46:26,980
Yeah, it's because you can hear yourself,

1102
00:46:26,980 --> 00:46:29,180
so you can actually tell what you're saying.

1103
00:46:29,180 --> 00:46:32,300
See, us three, we probably all suffer from allergies,

1104
00:46:32,300 --> 00:46:35,040
so when we get in there without a live studio monitor

1105
00:46:35,040 --> 00:46:35,880
trying to sing--

1106
00:46:35,880 --> 00:46:37,300
- Right, it's over.

1107
00:46:37,300 --> 00:46:39,940
- Way off, way, way off, because of the congestion.

1108
00:46:39,940 --> 00:46:42,420
- I'm on stage singing with my headphones on.

1109
00:46:42,420 --> 00:46:43,260
- Yep.

1110
00:46:43,260 --> 00:46:44,800

That's my new favorite.

1114
00:46:50,040 --> 00:46:51,800
I think I'm going to do that at karaoke next time I go.

1115
00:46:51,800 --> 00:46:52,800
What song?

1116
00:46:52,800 --> 00:46:55,560
Coldplay and the Chainsmokers, Something Just Like This.

1117
00:46:55,560 --> 00:46:56,560
Do do do do do.

1118
00:46:56,560 --> 00:46:58,600
Is that the music video where there are monkeys?

1119
00:46:58,600 --> 00:47:02,840
How much you wanted something, how much you wanted this.

1120

You know what I'm talking about?

1121
00:47:03,840 --> 00:47:04,840
No.

1122
00:47:04,840 --> 00:47:05,840
The Coldplay music video where they're all monkeys.

1123
00:47:05,840 --> 00:47:07,320
You're thinking of the Discovery Channel.

1124
00:47:07,320 --> 00:47:08,320
No, I'm not.

1125
00:47:08,320 --> 00:47:09,320
Yeah, you are.

I've never seen that one.

1128
00:47:12,360 --> 00:47:15,020

Yeah, the world.

1132
00:47:24,220 --> 00:47:26,220
We need to get an auto-tune filter.

Oh, that'd be perfect.

No, have you? Yeah, they're really hard to use. They make you move it, make it.

1161
00:48:46,260 --> 00:48:55,220
Yours sounds so... Yours with the pitch up, you do sound exactly like that voice.

1162
00:48:55,220 --> 00:48:58,540
Like a Daft Punk voice? Yeah, I feel like mine is just way... I think I have too

1163
00:48:58,540 --> 00:49:02,220
much range in my normal talking thing. You have kind of a... I never noticed you

1164
00:49:02,220 --> 00:49:07,300
have a bit of a monotone to you. Do I? Yeah, I think so. I don't think so, man.

1165
00:49:07,900 --> 00:49:11,300
Or maybe it's a suit. Maybe you do have an amazing voice, but maybe it's the,

1166
00:49:11,300 --> 00:49:13,300
the, as soon as the pitch comes on,

1167
00:49:13,300 --> 00:49:15,700
maybe you're doing that because it sounds funnier.

1168
00:49:15,700 --> 00:49:20,180
Yeah. Maybe I just started working with this new guy. Who's I won't blow up his

1169
00:49:20,180 --> 00:49:22,300
details, but he works in Europe.

1170
00:49:22,300 --> 00:49:24,580
Blow up Jody's fucking detail. I did blow up Jody's.

1171
00:49:24,580 --> 00:49:26,380
So let's wait 10 years on this guy.

1172
00:49:26,380 --> 00:49:30,540
Right, right. But this guy has somehow the most calming voice I ever heard.

1173
00:49:30,540 --> 00:49:31,500
What did he sound like?

1174
00:49:31,500 --> 00:49:33,180
Hello?

1175
00:49:33,180 --> 00:49:35,020
Is he from Sweden?

1176
00:49:35,020 --> 00:49:36,180
Oh my God. It is a wave.

1177
00:49:36,180 --> 00:49:41,460
know a wave of calm. I'm just like asking more details because it's so calming.

1178
00:49:41,460 --> 00:49:48,340
When I like that, he goes, hello, Swedish guys do kind of have calming

1179
00:49:48,340 --> 00:49:52,700
voices for some reason. Do the most calming voice you can right now. Really?

1180
00:49:52,700 --> 00:49:56,900
And it's really try to calm us down or else you get shot and killed. OK, all

1181
00:49:56,900 --> 00:50:01,100
right, I'll do the most common calming voice I can think of. Silence of the

1182
00:50:01,100 --> 00:50:06,860
lambs. Yeah, you're dead. You're trying to do Morgan Freeman. Oh, that's kind of

1183
00:50:06,860 --> 00:50:12,580
that was scary. That was that was full. I'm trying to do it in the basket. I'm

1184
00:50:12,580 --> 00:50:17,580
gonna try. Does this sound coming? No. Now I'm hearing it. No, you're right.

1185
00:50:17,580 --> 00:50:24,620
There is a beautiful river that you're walking alongside of and there's noises

1186
00:50:24,620 --> 00:50:29,740
from every animal in the forest. Isn't calming me. This is common. This is I

1187
00:50:29,740 --> 00:50:30,740
I would say it works.

1188
00:50:30,740 --> 00:50:31,740
Pretty calm.

1189
00:50:31,740 --> 00:50:32,740
This is calming?

1190
00:50:32,740 --> 00:50:33,740
I think that was pretty calming.

1191
00:50:33,740 --> 00:50:36,740
And the most beautiful woman you've ever seen is topless.

1192
00:50:36,740 --> 00:50:37,740
Now I'm calm.

1193
00:50:37,740 --> 00:50:42,900
Walking right towards you with a giant, she has the face of Tig Notaro and the body of

1194
00:50:42,900 --> 00:50:43,900
Alexandra Daddario.

1195
00:50:43,900 --> 00:50:48,300
And she's walking directly at you.

1196
00:50:48,300 --> 00:50:49,300
But now she has a knife.

1197
00:50:49,300 --> 00:50:50,300
No!

1198
00:50:50,300 --> 00:50:52,740
Oh, I lost it there at the end.

1199
00:50:52,740 --> 00:50:55,340
Alright, do your calmest voice now.

1200
00:50:55,340 --> 00:50:56,340
Okay.

1201
00:50:56,340 --> 00:50:57,340
Hi.

1202
00:50:57,340 --> 00:50:58,340
Welcome to...

1203
00:50:58,340 --> 00:51:01,680
- Hi, welcome to my doctor's office.

1204
00:51:01,680 --> 00:51:03,920
(laughing)

1205
00:51:03,920 --> 00:51:08,880
I hear that you are in need of a cranial nerve exam today.

1206
00:51:08,880 --> 00:51:12,860
What's your first name?

1207
00:51:12,860 --> 00:51:13,700
- Greg.

1208
00:51:13,700 --> 00:51:15,060
- Thank you.

1209
00:51:15,060 --> 00:51:15,900
Last name?

1210
00:51:15,900 --> 00:51:20,860
And what is ailing you today?

1211
00:51:20,860 --> 00:51:22,220
How's your stomach feeling?

1212
00:51:22,220 --> 00:51:26,020
Excellent.

1213
00:51:27,140 --> 00:51:30,920
I'm scared of doctors. I hate doctors.

1214
00:51:30,920 --> 00:51:32,820
What? I listen to probably...

1215
00:51:32,820 --> 00:51:35,320
Do you listen to Dr. ASMR all the time?

1216
00:51:35,320 --> 00:51:36,620
Dr. ASMR, really?

1217
00:51:36,620 --> 00:51:38,020
That's calming to you?

1218
00:51:38,020 --> 00:51:38,720
Oh yeah.

1219
00:51:38,720 --> 00:51:40,420
Because he sleeps like a...

1220
00:51:40,420 --> 00:51:41,320
Vampire.

1221
00:51:41,320 --> 00:51:42,520
Like Master Chief.

1222
00:51:42,520 --> 00:51:43,020
Yeah.

1223
00:51:43,020 --> 00:51:44,220
He goes into every night...

1224
00:51:44,220 --> 00:51:45,420
Oh, you've got the sleep app.

1225
00:51:45,420 --> 00:51:46,220
I've got to get that.

1226
00:51:46,220 --> 00:51:46,720
He has a sleep app.

1227
00:51:46,720 --> 00:51:47,420
I do, dude.

1228
00:51:47,420 --> 00:51:48,620
Do you keep a mask on too?

1229
00:51:48,620 --> 00:51:49,120
No.

1230
00:51:49,120 --> 00:51:49,620
A sleeping mask?

1231
00:51:49,620 --> 00:51:51,020
Sometimes I put a pillow over my face.

1232
00:51:51,020 --> 00:51:53,520
So you do that and you wear headphones that play ASMR, right?

1233
00:51:53,520 --> 00:51:54,020
Yeah, yeah.

1234
00:51:54,020 --> 00:51:54,520
Yeah, so...

1235
00:51:54,520 --> 00:51:55,520
You, Jesus Christ.

1236
00:51:55,520 --> 00:51:56,520
Can I lay like this?

1237
00:51:56,520 --> 00:51:58,840
no sense. You die every night. You die.

1238
00:51:58,840 --> 00:51:59,520
Essentially.

1239
00:51:59,520 --> 00:52:00,520
Yeah. All the senses are gone.

1240
00:52:00,520 --> 00:52:01,520
And I welcome it.

1241
00:52:01,520 --> 00:52:02,520
God, that's so sick.

1242
00:52:02,520 --> 00:52:03,520
It is scary.

1243
00:52:03,520 --> 00:52:07,960
Do you, so when you are looking up ASMRs, you're not listening to the ones that are

1244
00:52:07,960 --> 00:52:13,920
girls like, "Oh, I dropped my ass," or something. I don't know.

1245
00:52:13,920 --> 00:52:15,160
They drop their ass.

1246
00:52:15,160 --> 00:52:18,800
I have never written one of those, okay? That was the first time writing one and it was

1247
00:52:18,800 --> 00:52:19,800
on the spot.

1248
00:52:19,800 --> 00:52:23,340
Okay. I listen to almost exclusively like fugly men.

1249
00:52:23,340 --> 00:52:27,420
You have to. Because you might pop one while you're trying to fall asleep and it's a girl's

1250
00:52:27,420 --> 00:52:28,420
voice.

1251
00:52:28,420 --> 00:52:39,580
My whole perception of ASMRs is warped because the only ASMR that I know of is this video

1252
00:52:39,580 --> 00:52:42,980
of this guy, his name was like Tony Bamboni.

1253
00:52:42,980 --> 00:52:45,500
Tony Bamboni? Hello Poopsies?

1254
00:52:45,500 --> 00:52:46,500
Yeah.

1255
00:52:46,500 --> 00:52:47,500
What?

1256
00:52:47,500 --> 00:52:48,500
Seen him.

1257
00:52:48,500 --> 00:52:49,500
Yeah.

1258
00:52:49,500 --> 00:52:50,500
Who the fuck is this?

1259
00:52:50,500 --> 00:52:51,500
He would do the fairy ones.

1260
00:52:51,500 --> 00:52:52,500
Who are Poopsies?

1261
00:52:52,500 --> 00:52:59,900
the one that I saw it was him as a wood nymph or something and he is caught by

1262
00:52:59,900 --> 00:53:04,500
paparazzi. What does he do? Is he trying to be funny?

1263
00:53:04,500 --> 00:53:05,500
Stop, stop.

1264
00:53:05,500 --> 00:53:07,500
No paparazzi, no paparazzi.

1265
00:53:07,500 --> 00:53:10,500
That's calming. That was more calming than the first one.

1266
00:53:10,500 --> 00:53:12,500
That was way better than your scary one.

1267
00:53:12,500 --> 00:53:16,500
The problem was the first time you did it, you tried to sound too tough and too

1268
00:53:16,500 --> 00:53:17,500
much like a deep voice guy.

1269
00:53:17,500 --> 00:53:18,500
Yeah.

1270
00:53:18,500 --> 00:53:20,500
You need to have a nice calm voice.

1271
00:53:20,500 --> 00:53:22,120
- Hey, welcome.

1272
00:53:22,120 --> 00:53:23,900
- 'Cause I have a pretty low register.

1273
00:53:23,900 --> 00:53:24,740
- Yeah.

1274
00:53:24,740 --> 00:53:26,820
- Yeah, low cash register, broke boy.

1275
00:53:26,820 --> 00:53:27,660
- Yep.

1276
00:53:27,660 --> 00:53:29,820
- These people are legit good at like,

1277
00:53:29,820 --> 00:53:31,100
there's this one guy I listen to,

1278
00:53:31,100 --> 00:53:33,760
who's probably, I listen to probably 300 hours

1279
00:53:33,760 --> 00:53:34,600
of him talking.

1280
00:53:34,600 --> 00:53:37,260
And I don't know, he just is talking

1281
00:53:37,260 --> 00:53:38,940
for an hour and a half sometimes.

1282
00:53:38,940 --> 00:53:40,740
And sometimes I'll just stay up and listen

1283
00:53:40,740 --> 00:53:41,900
'cause it's a little bit interesting.

1284
00:53:41,900 --> 00:53:42,740
He's just going off his own.

1285
00:53:42,740 --> 00:53:44,220
- Does he tell a story?

1286
00:53:44,220 --> 00:53:46,580
- He tells stories, he gets into his opinions,

1287
00:53:46,580 --> 00:53:47,900
'cause he run out of gas.

1288
00:53:47,900 --> 00:53:48,740
- Yeah.

1289
00:53:48,740 --> 00:53:50,060
- Doing the role play out of certain points.

1290
00:53:50,060 --> 00:53:53,740
So your real opinions come out and that's, I think it's kind of beautiful.

1291
00:53:53,740 --> 00:53:57,260
So he starts talking about the vaccine and shit.

1292
00:53:57,260 --> 00:53:59,620
He starts talking about like how when he was growing up,

1293
00:53:59,620 --> 00:54:01,020
like his parents didn't appreciate

1294
00:54:01,020 --> 00:54:06,860
like how he wished he could have been a better father in certain ways.

1295
00:54:06,860 --> 00:54:09,340
Whoa. I mean, he gets really into it.

1296
00:54:09,340 --> 00:54:11,500
Imagine being that guy's kid or something.

1297
00:54:11,500 --> 00:54:14,580
And that's the only time you ever hear that shit is in a whispered voice.

1298
00:54:14,580 --> 00:54:16,620
And your dad's talking in a black ear.

1299
00:54:16,660 --> 00:54:21,660
he's hoping that his children look up his ASMR channel.

1300
00:54:21,660 --> 00:54:25,220
- Yeah, they fall asleep to it.

1301
00:54:25,220 --> 00:54:27,360
I don't think if my dad did anything,

1302
00:54:27,360 --> 00:54:28,860
I would watch it or listen to it.

1303
00:54:28,860 --> 00:54:30,060
- Yeah? - Really?

1304
00:54:30,060 --> 00:54:32,060
- Yeah, I remember-- - You'd be too scared?

1305
00:54:32,060 --> 00:54:32,900
- Yeah, kinda.

1306
00:54:32,900 --> 00:54:34,000
I remember my dad used to write,

1307
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:35,340
for his fantasy football league,

1308
00:54:35,340 --> 00:54:37,740
he used to write a newsletter every Monday.

1309
00:54:37,740 --> 00:54:39,720
And I one time read it, and it was like,

1310
00:54:39,720 --> 00:54:41,940
literally all just complaining about his family.

1311
00:54:41,940 --> 00:54:44,180
(laughing)

1312
00:54:45,420 --> 00:54:47,580
Well, my son sucks at football.

1313
00:54:47,580 --> 00:54:48,380
No, but you?

1314
00:54:48,380 --> 00:54:48,880
Yes.

1315
00:54:48,880 --> 00:54:49,380
No.

1316
00:54:49,380 --> 00:54:54,260
And I was like, "Yeah, I don't think I want to read any more of these."

1317
00:54:54,260 --> 00:54:55,600
Yeah.

1318
00:54:55,600 --> 00:55:00,020
I had played Little League Baseball, and I remember hearing there was a kid on

1319
00:55:00,020 --> 00:55:07,860
our team named Doug, and he was horrible at... I mean, I was bad, but he was bad.

1320
00:55:07,860 --> 00:55:11,620
And his dad was so embarrassed. That one time I heard him say behind me, he's

1321
00:55:11,620 --> 00:55:12,820
like, "Fucking Doug."

1322
00:55:14,700 --> 00:55:16,900
And then he walked away and came back after the game.

1323
00:55:16,900 --> 00:55:19,500
What a perfect name to be saying like,

1324
00:55:19,500 --> 00:55:22,800
"God, fucking this stupid kid. Fucking Doug."

1325
00:55:22,800 --> 00:55:24,900
Like, why do you name your kid Doug?

1326
00:55:24,900 --> 00:55:26,900
Bill and Strong and Doug was like a scornful.

1327
00:55:26,900 --> 00:55:28,900
I just saw the craziest guy walk by.

1328
00:55:28,900 --> 00:55:29,800
Sorry to interrupt.

1329
00:55:29,800 --> 00:55:30,500
What did he do?

1330
00:55:30,500 --> 00:55:33,000
Tattoo all the way around his old guy.

1331
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:35,100
Tattoos all over his face.

1332
00:55:35,100 --> 00:55:36,400
That's not that crazy.

1333
00:55:36,400 --> 00:55:40,000
That was, I mean, to see them walking, looking in, just like...

1334
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:41,100
Not in Brooklyn, baby.

1335
00:55:41,100 --> 00:55:41,500
Yeah.

1336
00:55:41,500 --> 00:55:41,900
That's true.

1337
00:55:41,900 --> 00:55:45,380
Are you guys going to be doing man on the street type interviews now that you're in retail?

1338
00:55:45,380 --> 00:55:46,380
We could.

1339
00:55:46,380 --> 00:55:47,380
Should we?

1340
00:55:47,380 --> 00:55:48,380
Put a sign out, come on in.

1341
00:55:48,380 --> 00:55:49,380
Yeah.

1342
00:55:49,380 --> 00:55:50,380
I thought about it.

1343
00:55:50,380 --> 00:55:51,380
Let that fucker in.

1344
00:55:51,380 --> 00:55:52,380
We should do a couple episodes where it's just anybody.

1345
00:55:52,380 --> 00:55:53,380
We'll just leave the door open.

1346
00:55:53,380 --> 00:55:54,380
Anything goes.

1347
00:55:54,380 --> 00:55:55,380
You walk in.

1348
00:55:55,380 --> 00:55:56,380
This spot is so mother effing sick.

1349
00:55:56,380 --> 00:55:57,380
Yep.

1350
00:55:57,380 --> 00:55:58,380
And so close to all our houses.

1351
00:55:58,380 --> 00:55:59,380
Yep.

1352
00:55:59,380 --> 00:56:00,380
It's close to my house.

1353
00:56:00,380 --> 00:56:01,380
Ridgewood.

1354
00:56:01,380 --> 00:56:02,380
Stand up.

1355
00:56:02,380 --> 00:56:03,380
I mean, I'll let everybody know that it's my house.

1356
00:56:03,380 --> 00:56:04,380
Oh yeah.

1357
00:56:04,380 --> 00:56:06,380
People basically know exactly where I live at this point.

1358
00:56:06,380 --> 00:56:07,380
Really?

1359
00:56:07,380 --> 00:56:13,980
who lives like two doors down, who one time he like stopped us when I first moved here

1360
00:56:13,980 --> 00:56:16,580
and he was like, "Hey man, I really like the podcast." I was like, "Oh, thank you." And

1361
00:56:16,580 --> 00:56:18,300
then he walked into the apartment next to mine.

1362
00:56:18,300 --> 00:56:19,300
No.

1363
00:56:19,300 --> 00:56:25,020
But he's a nice guy. He's a nice guy. But if he ever crosses me, I will attack him.

1364
00:56:25,020 --> 00:56:27,900
You think you have people that would recognize you in Des Moines?

1365
00:56:27,900 --> 00:56:28,900
Iowa?

1366
00:56:28,900 --> 00:56:29,900
Maybe.

1367
00:56:29,900 --> 00:56:30,900
Yeah, yeah.

1368
00:56:30,900 --> 00:56:36,980
Definitely. I was a hot bed for leftist podcasts like this. Yeah. And like Joy Tactics.

1369
00:56:36,980 --> 00:56:38,980
Oh yeah, they love our asses.

1370
00:56:38,980 --> 00:56:40,980
Explicitly political podcast like us and Joy Tactics.

1371
00:56:40,980 --> 00:56:44,980
Yeah, I interrupted the Little League stuff though.

1372
00:56:44,980 --> 00:56:46,980
No, that's about it.

1373
00:56:46,980 --> 00:56:48,980
Because I saw a crazy guy, but I had a,

1374
00:56:48,980 --> 00:56:50,980
I hit an inside the park home run

1375
00:56:50,980 --> 00:56:52,980
in Little League.

1376
00:56:52,980 --> 00:56:54,980
That just means that everybody is

1377
00:56:54,980 --> 00:56:56,980
such shitty.

1378
00:56:56,980 --> 00:56:58,980
That's not an indication

1379
00:56:58,980 --> 00:57:00,980
of your skill. That means that you

1380
00:57:00,980 --> 00:57:02,980
were playing against children.

1381
00:57:02,980 --> 00:57:04,980
My parents talked about that,

1382
00:57:04,980 --> 00:57:09,100
was a big proud moment and then I realized later like, oh yeah, that means that they were just

1383
00:57:09,100 --> 00:57:10,860
all everyone else was just super slow.

1384
00:57:10,860 --> 00:57:14,700
Well, yeah, because all the kids, I mean, did you you know who they put the worst kids they

1385
00:57:14,700 --> 00:57:18,180
put in the outfield and those kids when a ball gets out there, they go, fuck me.

1386
00:57:18,180 --> 00:57:20,180
That was this kid Scott.

1387
00:57:20,180 --> 00:57:21,180
Fuck me.

1388
00:57:21,180 --> 00:57:24,340
When I was when I played for the crisscross applesauce on the field anyway, so you got

1389
00:57:24,340 --> 00:57:25,340
to put the losers.

1390
00:57:25,340 --> 00:57:26,340
Exactly.

1391
00:57:26,340 --> 00:57:27,600
That was that's where I was center.

1392
00:57:27,600 --> 00:57:30,900
They put me second base and then I was next to Scott.

1393
00:57:30,900 --> 00:57:33,460
Scott Bolio, I think was his name.

1394
00:57:33,460 --> 00:57:34,860
That was not his name, motherfucker.

1395
00:57:34,860 --> 00:57:36,400
Scott, he sounds bolio.

1396
00:57:36,400 --> 00:57:41,700
And he had just seen Over the Hedge and really liked Hammy from Over the Hedge.

1397
00:57:41,700 --> 00:57:42,700
Which one is Hammy?

1398
00:57:42,700 --> 00:57:43,700
If you remember that movie.

1399
00:57:43,700 --> 00:57:44,700
Steve Carell's little squirrel character.

1400
00:57:44,700 --> 00:57:45,700
Oh, okay.

1401
00:57:45,700 --> 00:57:46,700
Who has ADHD.

1402
00:57:46,700 --> 00:57:47,700
Oh, Hammy.

1403
00:57:47,700 --> 00:57:51,360
And he would sit there and he would quote Hammy at me.

1404
00:57:51,360 --> 00:57:54,140
He wanted to be Hammy, I think.

1405
00:57:54,140 --> 00:57:55,140
That's cool.

1406
00:57:55,140 --> 00:57:59,060
And he would sit there and just scream like Hammy quotes at me.

1407
00:57:59,060 --> 00:58:03,860
I've never been so annoyed in my life just listening to this kid.

1408
00:58:03,860 --> 00:58:05,860
I remember a movie that no one talks about anymore.

1409
00:58:05,860 --> 00:58:11,060
Kids in middle school and shit like emulating characters from movies was so funny, dude.

1410
00:58:11,060 --> 00:58:16,860
There was a kid who later became my friend, but he was when Napoleon Dynamite came out,

1411
00:58:16,860 --> 00:58:21,060
he would just talk like Napoleon Dynamite and like say all the Napoleon Dynamite lines.

1412
00:58:21,060 --> 00:58:22,060
Yeah.

1413
00:58:22,060 --> 00:58:23,060
He was very, very cool.

1414
00:58:23,060 --> 00:58:25,860
And he had a Napoleon Dynamite backpack, which is pretty badass.

1415
00:58:25,860 --> 00:58:28,460
And you were probably what, six when Napoleon Dynamite came out?

1416
00:58:28,460 --> 00:58:31,660
I was in this is probably third grade or something by this point.

1417
00:58:31,660 --> 00:58:35,060
Man, there's never gonna be a hit like that again.

1418
00:58:35,060 --> 00:58:36,060
No. No.

1419
00:58:36,060 --> 00:58:37,560
A sleeper hit like that.

1420
00:58:37,560 --> 00:58:39,560
Nobody, the Mormons are done.

1421
00:58:39,560 --> 00:58:40,560
No one's buying DVDs anymore.

1422
00:58:40,560 --> 00:58:41,060
Not yet.

1423
00:58:41,060 --> 00:58:42,560
Is that how Napoleon Dynamite got big?

1424
00:58:42,560 --> 00:58:44,060
Yep. DVD sales.

1425
00:58:44,060 --> 00:58:45,560
Bring physical media back.

1426
00:58:45,560 --> 00:58:48,060
That's what used to make shit pop off.

1427
00:58:48,060 --> 00:58:48,560
Bring it back.

1428
00:58:48,560 --> 00:58:50,560
Was physical media. Renting, rental stores.

1429
00:58:50,560 --> 00:58:51,560
DVDs look better.

1430
00:58:51,560 --> 00:58:55,560
You used to be able to rent DVDs, not have to worry about it.

1431
00:58:55,560 --> 00:58:57,560
And don't just, I want specifically.

1432
00:58:57,560 --> 00:59:01,660
I want DVD ROMs that have games on.

1433
00:59:01,660 --> 00:59:03,760
Yeah, we've talked about this extensively.

1434
00:59:03,760 --> 00:59:04,860
The Elf DVD.

1435
00:59:04,860 --> 00:59:06,760
Very good games on there.

1436
00:59:06,760 --> 00:59:08,860
Santa Claus 2 DVD.

1437
00:59:08,860 --> 00:59:12,260
I want them to make one for three billboards outside of

1438
00:59:12,260 --> 00:59:13,960
Ebbing, Missouri where I can play.

1439
00:59:13,960 --> 00:59:15,660
You can make your own billboards.

1440
00:59:15,660 --> 00:59:18,460
I can play a word hunt or something.

1441
00:59:18,460 --> 00:59:20,160
That's what I want so badly, dude.

1442
00:59:20,160 --> 00:59:21,860
Yeah, that shit was the best.

1443
00:59:21,860 --> 00:59:23,360
The Banshees of Inisheren.

1444
00:59:23,360 --> 00:59:24,960
Media is fucking dead.

1445
00:59:24,960 --> 00:59:25,660
Yeah, I know.

1446
00:59:25,660 --> 00:59:26,560
It's over.

1447
00:59:26,560 --> 00:59:30,000
leaning on us so heavy and we're sitting here like trying our fucking best.

1448
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:32,520
This is not our best dude. This is,

1449
00:59:32,520 --> 00:59:37,920
I've only touched maybe 18% of these numbers. So this is,

1450
00:59:37,920 --> 00:59:42,600
so now I could be at the WGA writers strike right now.

1451
00:59:42,600 --> 00:59:46,760
Oh, and I can be saying, Hey, ho, ho. There's that guy. He's back.

1452
00:59:46,760 --> 00:59:51,080
Did you see him? No. What is that fucking guy? He came back.

1453
00:59:51,080 --> 00:59:54,240
We got to face you away from the windows.

1454
00:59:54,240 --> 00:59:55,440
You could be sitting over there.

1455
00:59:55,440 --> 00:59:58,640
Yeah, or you could just maybe control your brain a little more.

1456
00:59:58,640 --> 00:59:59,840
That guy looks cool though.

1457
00:59:59,840 --> 01:00:01,240
Damn.

1458
01:00:01,240 --> 01:00:02,540
He does not seem like he looks cool.

1459
01:00:02,540 --> 01:00:03,740
He has tattoos on his head.

1460
01:00:03,740 --> 01:00:06,140
He has, you see that all the time.

1461
01:00:06,140 --> 01:00:06,840
It's like a tattoo helmet.

1462
01:00:06,840 --> 01:00:08,240
If somebody has a tattoo...

1463
01:00:08,240 --> 01:00:11,040
This whole thing, this whole part of his face is fine.

1464
01:00:11,040 --> 01:00:12,240
The rest of it is tattoos.

1465
01:00:12,240 --> 01:00:13,840
Well, you like tattoos though.

1466
01:00:13,840 --> 01:00:14,340
Yeah.

1467
01:00:14,340 --> 01:00:15,840
Yeah, I hate that shit.

1468
01:00:15,840 --> 01:00:17,440
Yeah, tattoos are foolish.

1469
01:00:17,440 --> 01:00:18,340
You hate tattoos?

1470
01:00:18,340 --> 01:00:19,940
I don't think I'm getting another one.

1471
01:00:19,940 --> 01:00:20,540
Yeah.

1472
01:00:20,540 --> 01:00:22,240
I don't think I need to.

1473
01:00:22,240 --> 01:00:26,240
You got one of the best I've ever seen, but I have some of the most busted tattoos on the planet.

1474
01:00:26,240 --> 01:00:28,740
He's lying, he has cool tattoos. He has a donkey.

1475
01:00:28,740 --> 01:00:30,240
Oh, I've seen your donkey.

1476
01:00:30,240 --> 01:00:32,240
That I thought was a horse when I got it.

1477
01:00:32,240 --> 01:00:34,240
I like the donkey, I think it's cool.

1478
01:00:34,240 --> 01:00:36,240
Well, that's the kind of tattoos that you like.

1479
01:00:36,240 --> 01:00:37,240
I like the donkey.

1480
01:00:37,240 --> 01:00:39,240
You like kind of stick and poke.

1481
01:00:39,240 --> 01:00:40,240
I don't like stick and poke.

1482
01:00:40,240 --> 01:00:43,240
You're going to come in one day with just a tattoo of a line.

1483
01:00:43,240 --> 01:00:45,240
Why are people getting that tattoo?

1484
01:00:45,240 --> 01:00:46,240
What's the line?

1485
01:00:46,240 --> 01:00:49,240
Just a black line on their arm and shit. Fuck you.

1486
01:00:49,240 --> 01:00:50,240
Black line around?

1487
01:00:50,240 --> 01:00:52,240
Just a black, yeah. What are you getting a line for?

1488
01:00:52,240 --> 01:00:54,240
There's that, I don't know. It's all these like

1489
01:00:54,240 --> 01:00:56,240
influencer style tattoos that people

1490
01:00:56,240 --> 01:00:58,240
are getting where it's like, oh I don't want to get. If you ever say that again

1491
01:00:58,240 --> 01:01:00,240
I will shove that microphone so

1492
01:01:00,240 --> 01:01:02,240
far down your mouth. Influencer style tattoos.

1493
01:01:02,240 --> 01:01:04,240
I will kill you with a single flick.

1494
01:01:04,240 --> 01:01:06,240
You ever seen that spot on, next to

1495
01:01:06,240 --> 01:01:08,240
Brookland? What's it called? That tattoo

1496
01:01:08,240 --> 01:01:10,240
place called Minimal Tattoo? That's

1497
01:01:10,240 --> 01:01:12,240
awful. It looks like an influencer like

1498
01:01:12,240 --> 01:01:14,240
vibes place. Yeah.

1499
01:01:14,240 --> 01:01:16,240
What is it, you get a tattoo of a triangle?

1500
01:01:16,240 --> 01:01:18,240
Fuck that dude. Something like that, yeah.

1501
01:01:18,240 --> 01:01:20,480
Oh, these are just multiple shapes on my arm.

1502
01:01:20,480 --> 01:01:21,480
No fucking shapes.

1503
01:01:21,480 --> 01:01:22,480
No, no, no.

1504
01:01:22,480 --> 01:01:24,440
I got this thing, I got this guy, he's cool.

1505
01:01:24,440 --> 01:01:27,240
I'm looking at these people's arms trying to do math and shit.

1506
01:01:27,240 --> 01:01:28,040
No, no, no.

1507
01:01:28,040 --> 01:01:30,040
Well, you guys know the story of my worst tattoo.

1508
01:01:30,040 --> 01:01:33,040
I don't think it's the worst, but my first tattoo,

1509
01:01:33,040 --> 01:01:35,040
it's this one, it's the 45 with the crown on it.

1510
01:01:35,040 --> 01:01:35,920
Trump.

1511
01:01:35,920 --> 01:01:36,920
Okay, well that's...

1512
01:01:36,920 --> 01:01:37,920
(laughing)

1513
01:01:37,920 --> 01:01:38,920
That's what I'm saying.

1514
01:01:38,920 --> 01:01:40,920
You know, my college improv team,

1515
01:01:40,920 --> 01:01:42,920
which is even more embarrassing, I feel like,

1516
01:01:42,920 --> 01:01:47,920
is called the 45 Kings, much respect to the current cast and crew.

1517
01:01:47,920 --> 01:01:53,920
45 Kings sounds like a white guy who does raps.

1518
01:01:53,920 --> 01:01:55,920
That sounds like an Italian guy.

1519
01:01:55,920 --> 01:01:56,920
Like an Ohio.

1520
01:01:56,920 --> 01:01:59,920
A white guy who does raps as in wrapping cars.

1521
01:01:59,920 --> 01:02:00,920
Yeah.

1522
01:02:00,920 --> 01:02:05,920
He has like a garage where he puts Pepsi wraps on people's cars for money.

1523
01:02:05,920 --> 01:02:07,920
But what about this tattoo?

1524
01:02:07,920 --> 01:02:10,920
Just that it was a stick and poke and is my first thing and I thought it.

1525
01:02:10,920 --> 01:02:13,920
I mean, look at that. Would you look at that and think Trump is king?

1526
01:02:13,920 --> 01:02:17,320
You know what I did think? I would say God Emperor Trump is what that guy was thinking

1527
01:02:17,320 --> 01:02:22,420
when he got that tattoo. I saw that and I was like, "Oh, why does he have the new Bam Margera

1528
01:02:22,420 --> 01:02:26,360
logo tattoo on his knee?" Does it look like that? It looks like that. No way. That's so

1529
01:02:26,360 --> 01:02:34,240
much sicker. But it's a 43. Oh, he has 43. Yeah, and I think it's supposed to be representative

1530
01:02:34,240 --> 01:02:40,200
of his son or something. His son, Phoenix Wolf Margera. That's his son's name? Phoenix Wolf,

1531
01:02:40,200 --> 01:02:47,440
That's fucking badass. He's going through it right now. I feel so sad. We're praying for him. We really are I got

1532
01:02:47,440 --> 01:02:55,320
I got like close to blackout drunk one time and was talking about Bam Margera at a party and I was close to tears

1533
01:02:55,320 --> 01:02:59,460
Oh, I mean, it's it's sad. Yeah, really the way

1534
01:02:59,460 --> 01:03:03,080
Addiction he was

1535
01:03:03,080 --> 01:03:07,460
Video I've ever seen a BAM in the last eight years. The first comment is always

1536
01:03:08,400 --> 01:03:11,400
It's always Bam died when Ryan Dunn died.

1537
01:03:11,400 --> 01:03:14,400
And it's like, come on now.

1538
01:03:14,400 --> 01:03:16,400
That's every single one.

1539
01:03:16,400 --> 01:03:21,400
Well they didn't hear the song that Bam put out immediately after Ryan Dunn died.

1540
01:03:21,400 --> 01:03:22,400
What was it?

1541
01:03:22,400 --> 01:03:25,400
Captain, er, Fuckface Unstoppable.

1542
01:03:25,400 --> 01:03:27,400
Bend my dick to my ass.

1543
01:03:27,400 --> 01:03:29,400
He did that for Ryan Dunn?

1544
01:03:29,400 --> 01:03:32,400
Like the year after Ryan Dunn died.

1545
01:03:32,400 --> 01:03:34,400
That was the first thing he put out.

1546
01:03:34,400 --> 01:03:38,960
Everyone's like, "I wonder how Bam's gonna like, you know, I wonder how he's gonna,

1547
01:03:38,960 --> 01:03:43,280
yeah, I wonder how he's gonna like, you know, come back from this first thing he does.

1548
01:03:43,280 --> 01:03:48,240
Bend my dick to my ass so I can't fuck myself." It's a dubstep fucking anthem.

1549
01:03:48,240 --> 01:03:52,480
If I was him, I would have, I think if that happened to me, if you died in a horrific

1550
01:03:52,480 --> 01:03:56,720
car accident and you exploded at 120 miles an hour and it was completely your fault,

1551
01:03:56,720 --> 01:04:01,120
like the ride down thing, I would move to China or Tibet or something.

1552
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:05,800
I would become a monk. Yeah.

1553
01:04:05,800 --> 01:04:09,240
Because you'd finally know peace because I wasn't in your life.

1554
01:04:09,240 --> 01:04:13,360
Exactly. I'd finally have a clear head for the first time ever.

1555
01:04:13,360 --> 01:04:16,840
What the fuck am I doing here? And I would move to where I belong,

1556
01:04:16,840 --> 01:04:20,000
which is up there in the mountains. The white lion. Yes.

1557
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:26,880
Thinking I'm going to like be like the boss or whatever.

1558
01:04:26,880 --> 01:04:28,800
A big tummy rugger of a lion's face.

1559
01:04:28,840 --> 01:04:31,760
I did become the monk that they all like train Kung Fu on.

1560
01:04:31,760 --> 01:04:34,040
He beat the shit out of me like a crash test dummy.

1561
01:04:34,040 --> 01:04:37,720
Yeah. Yeah. They say that they're calling you the white lion.

1562
01:04:37,720 --> 01:04:41,280
I'm like, yeah, I'm calling my mom. Basically, I'm the white lion.

1563
01:04:41,280 --> 01:04:44,840
Who does Batman study with in Batman Begins?

1564
01:04:44,840 --> 01:04:45,840
Ray Shaogul.

1565
01:04:45,840 --> 01:04:46,840
Oh, Ray Shaogul.

1566
01:04:46,840 --> 01:04:48,200
I'd go chill with him.

1567
01:04:48,200 --> 01:04:48,800
Liam Neeson.

1568
01:04:48,800 --> 01:04:49,880
Speaking of Batman.

1569
01:04:49,880 --> 01:04:52,480
What, you have a Batman mask over there?

1570
01:04:52,480 --> 01:04:54,320
There is a Batman mask over there.

1571
01:04:54,320 --> 01:04:56,160
Yeah, it's not mine.

1572
01:04:56,160 --> 01:04:58,080
So I think it's Alex's.

1573
01:04:58,080 --> 01:04:59,080
I think it's Alex's.

1574
01:04:59,080 --> 01:05:00,080
Oh, it's for Alex.

1575
01:05:00,080 --> 01:05:01,080
Yeah.

1576
01:05:01,080 --> 01:05:02,080
We share this space with him.

1577
01:05:02,080 --> 01:05:04,880
All right. We got to go to the gym, but you want to tell people where to find Joy Tactics

1578
01:05:04,880 --> 01:05:05,880
online.

1579
01:05:05,880 --> 01:05:06,880
Oh, yeah.

01:05:06,880 --> 01:05:09,880

01:05:10,880 --> 01:05:11,880
Apple Podcast.

1583
01:05:11,880 --> 01:05:12,880
Oh, maybe I'll do that. It's on YouTube.

1584
01:05:12,880 --> 01:05:19,400
It's on YouTube, too. We put it everywhere. Jack and I are editing the fuck out of it.

1585
01:05:19,400 --> 01:05:20,400
And also the Patreon.

1586
01:05:20,400 --> 01:05:22,400
Oh, and we got a crazy-ass Patreon.

1587
01:05:22,400 --> 01:05:24,640
Because I know y'all got to eat.

1588
01:05:24,640 --> 01:05:25,640
We got to eat.

1589
01:05:25,640 --> 01:05:26,640
You got to eat.

1590
01:05:26,640 --> 01:05:27,640
Yeah.

1591
01:05:27,640 --> 01:05:31,640
There's new restaurants every day.

1592
01:05:31,640 --> 01:05:32,640
Alright, thank you for coming, Eric.

1593
01:05:32,640 --> 01:05:33,640
