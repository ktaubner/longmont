1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,360
Now. Okay, so no coffee for me today. Really? With a white label, yerba

2
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:19,860
mate soda. I don't like those ones. I like the Genkia or whatever it's called.

3
00:00:19,860 --> 00:00:24,200
It's not called that. Bleep bleep blah. Bleep bleep blah. Yellow cane.

4
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:31,340
Yellow Cane. Speaking of Yellow Cane, I want to watch True Detective Season One

5
00:00:31,340 --> 00:00:36,840
again. I was thinking about it. I haven't seen it since I first seen it. I gotta check that show out.

6
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:41,200
I never watched it. You've never seen it? No. I saw the last episode of True

7
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:45,520
Detective with my dad and I was like, oh I don't. Which season did you see?

8
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:49,200
Did you see Mar- oh really? Yeah. Dude, why'd you watch it? You're a fucking idiot.

9
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:53,400
It's so- I didn't care about- Also, you can watch it again. It was on when I was in high school and I didn't care

10
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:56,600
about TV. You said F and immediately

11
00:00:56,600 --> 00:01:02,200
that's two right because F and that's true. I was even going to let it slide,

12
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:05,400
but I'm completely right darn it dude all right. Well, we're still not cussing,

13
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:08,640
but we are cussing, but we're paying the price. I have two bucks. This is my

14
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:12,120
allotment for the rest of the episode. That's why that's why it should be coins.

15
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:16,680
No, you don't under you are trying to make your brokenness of virtue. It's not

16
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:20,800
a brokenness. It is brokenness. It's not a broken chronic. It's that you are a

17
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:25,400
broke boy. You're a broke bird. People don't respect coins. Can we say broke

18
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:29,560
boy? No, I was replacing a different B word. That's meanness. That is meanness.

19
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:32,860
So, okay, is there just... Okay, how about this? How about this? You're

20
00:01:32,860 --> 00:01:38,680
kind of... You're like Aladdin or like what's a... Oliver Twist. You're a rat.

21
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:41,600
You have the virtue of Oliver Twist. You know how funny that would have been

22
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:45,180
with a high voice? What, your burp? That burp wouldn't have been very funny.

23
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:46,360
Well, yeah, it wouldn't have been. I mean, people have heard that before. What

24
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:50,120
are you talking about? A high pitched burp is funny. It's always funny.

25
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:54,120
it's fine. It's okay, but you could come up with better stuff to do in a high

26
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:59,680
pitch voice. I also think I think a low pitch verb verb verb of funny. I just

27
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:03,920
drink my little beer, but my brain will start activating pretty yeah yeah. My

28
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:08,640
brain still working on activating me to my allergies or beating the beating the

29
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:12,800
hold on now. Is this out of me really? Yeah, you said beating the devil out of

30
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:16,480
me. That's better because then it's like you don't want to use this. Yes, the

31
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:20,680
but Jesus is okay. I tell you a bub's Jesus yeah, it's as hot as

32
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:25,200

33
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:28,920
speaking of all of our twist. Yeah, it's twistedly hot. I've put in my air

34
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:32,360
conditioner unit, my AC unit really last night. I haven't done. I cranked it

35
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:37,820

36
00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:42,280

37
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:47,520

38
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:49,320
yeah playing on my iPad.

39
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:51,320
You can do that.

40
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:53,320
You can just always do that.

41
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:54,320
You have a leather couch?

42
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:56,600
No, you have a linen couch.

43
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:59,000
I hate being hot.

44
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,120
Go ahead and drop a bomb for me.

45
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:03,080

126
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:39,740

127
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:44,460

128
00:08:44,460 --> 00:08:46,920

so he's like

130
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:53,900

I try to or my

194
00:12:48,580 --> 00:12:52,420
oh my God, you make me that was all

195
00:12:52,420 --> 00:12:58,700
the character stuff. It's all traps to make you lose my every character has

196
00:12:58,700 --> 00:13:03,740
made you swear. Yep, that's because I'm an actor okay, and I'm an amazing actor

197
00:13:03,740 --> 00:13:04,180
at that

198
00:13:04,180 --> 00:13:10,000
dude. This is my last dollar and I'm down to my last dollar over that. See

199
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,900
you, I can loan you back the money. If you need a McGraw saying that I'm going

200
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:17,920
try not to need you to sign a form, though, if you we literally you need to

201
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:22,160
start selling Cameron. Yeah, we should just make a separate bank account for

202
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:25,620
the swear jar. We should make a new LLC called swear jar limited

203
00:13:25,620 --> 00:13:32,400
and we use it. We're laundering money. It's a yeah. It's like a charity. Yeah,

204
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:37,200
thing and all it does is it makes us there's still a bunch of yerba mate all

205
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:42,120
over the swear jar. Who cares? Just keep I do. The table is gonna leak.

206
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:46,800
the table's going to leave. You are so smart because I can't say the I word

207
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:51,540
yeah. We do need to figure out what we're doing with this money. Yeah, yeah,

208
00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:56,200
I don't. We talked about an anti swearing charity. We don't I really

209
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:59,640
don't want to give it to anybody. No hobo,

210
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:04,980
nobody who doesn't work. I don't think that we need to give it to a hard

211
00:14:04,980 --> 00:14:06,860
worker who is

212
00:14:06,860 --> 00:14:11,920
who does never sweared. You know, I do our betters. We should give it to like

213
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:15,320
like a millionaire because they'll probably double it, but millionaires

214
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:19,920
double it and give it to yeah the next person. Well, no wait. That's per we

215
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:22,540
need to give it to an entrepreneur. We need to give it to a millionaire or a

216
00:14:22,540 --> 00:14:25,900
billionaire who's going to invest. You know what, but I just want to say a lot

217
00:14:25,900 --> 00:14:29,720
of millionaires are kind of they collect a swear behind the scenes. The swear

218
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:35,220
jar, an iron man, the swear jar is going to go to buying us twitter blue

219
00:14:35,220 --> 00:14:38,880
the podcast. No yeah,

220
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:40,320
yeah,

221
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:41,320
that I know

222
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:47,280
that's funny. That's a funny idea. You think that's getting verified? You think

223
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:49,600
that's really that funny? It's funny. Yeah, and you know what else we should

224
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:51,320
buy with it? Hulu.

225
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:56,880
That's actually a good idea. Yeah, that is actually don't have Hulu right now,

226
00:14:56,880 --> 00:15:00,160
though. Yeah, Cameron doesn't have Hulu really between Hulu. So maybe

227
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:05,360
we should do Hulu. Yeah, no, I don't want Hulu and I don't want Max. I'll

228
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:05,840
tell you what

229
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:15,040
stop naming your crap after a day name after my day is allowed after my day

230
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:19,560
classmates names. Stop that I don't see crap on the list anywhere. I think I up

231
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:23,600
as a yeah, I say crap yeah all right. I think we can all say crap. Oh, I know

232
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:24,000
where it is.

233
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,160
That's a different see you am

234
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:31,920
oh yeah, that is actually what that is. Oh wait, but they're both they both are

235
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:33,360
obviously we can't say yeah

236
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:35,920
wait you did you added Falk

237
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:41,640
sexual. I actually was I was wondering maybe we can have a little panel here on

238
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:46,740
what we think about this. How do we feel about explicit violence? Oh, that's fine

239
00:15:46,740 --> 00:15:51,280
and ripping the shreds, violence, you mean like wait, dripping to shreds

240
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:55,320
discussions. That's fine yeah, it's no cussing it, but we also have like

241
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:59,960
meanness and we're going on TV. Well, but that's a tree, but like so if I say

242
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:05,440
I want to rip off Taylor Swift's head yeah that so that's sayable. You can say

243
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:09,780
that okay, but you can't say on a rip it off and take a dump in her mouth. Take

244
00:16:09,780 --> 00:16:10,140
it s

245
00:16:10,140 --> 00:16:15,120
is okay, because yeah, because that's a lot or or you don't want to say to say

246
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:19,280
oh, I'm going to get so high and then rip her head off right and then use your

247
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:22,380
head as a bong. Yeah, you can't say that I'm going to use your whole body like a

248
00:16:22,380 --> 00:16:27,020
bomb. It's going to be one big grav bomb. I'm a smoker s out of I'm going to use

249
00:16:27,020 --> 00:16:31,840
her like a car, but the grommet is in the belly button. What's a grommet the

250
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:35,400
thing that you pull the that's called a grommet where marijuana

251
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:38,540
Oh, I didn't know that. I thought it was called a pen.

252
00:16:38,540 --> 00:16:39,840
I don't know.

253
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:40,840
Oh, okay.

254
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:41,840
I don't know.

255
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:42,840
You're not a big smoker.

256
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:44,080
I don't like weed at all.

257
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:46,800
He got me a Willy Wonka marijuana bar the other day.

258
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:50,400
Yeah, for your bachelor party. I thought you were going to take a bite out of it and then

259
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:51,400
go home.

260
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:54,480
What? I haven't smoked weed in weeks. I'm off weed.

261
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:55,480
I didn't know that.

262
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:56,480
I don't like weed anymore.

263
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:58,680
Then who's... I spent like $45 on that.

264
00:16:58,680 --> 00:16:59,680
Yeah, I don't know why you did that.

265
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:00,680
$45? That was $45?

266
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:01,680
$45 chocolate bar.

267
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:02,680
It was a bachelor party gift.

268
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:06,480
the bachelor party. You know what I would have liked is an actual forty five

269
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:06,680
dollars.

270
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:10,920
Actually, forty five dollars. I borrow a life changing fire. Well, it was a

271
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:15,760
three hundred milligram edible. Yeah, which I bought because that's gonna I

272
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:19,920
bought it because I knew that it would scare you. It is. I'm like scared to

273
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:22,560
have it in my house. I feel like I have a gun in my house. Yeah, yeah, I feel

274
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:25,760
like I need to put it in a thumb safe. Well, we're also especially right

275
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:29,280
before the summer. It's gonna melt and go into the air. Yeah, that's what I'm

276
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:32,640
really worried about it. It's aerating it. Yeah. Well, it's you know what flavor it

277
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:34,960
is, right? Chocolate 100 grand

278
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:40,400
is a chocolate bar. Yeah, but it tastes exactly like a 100 grand. I don't think

279
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:43,200
okay, if it tastes exactly like it, then eat the whole thing and give me a review.

280
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:47,160
300 milligrams of weed would actually I would actually be in a mental

281
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:51,840
institution. If I ate that whole thing, I'm not kidding. I would be 100%. I would

282
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:57,280
be catatonically vegetative. Yeah, yeah, that's why I bought it. I'd rather eat

283
00:17:57,560 --> 00:18:02,720
vegetables. Yeah, I would rather I'd rather eat greens. No weed. I'd rather

284
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:06,580
eat metal than eat a three hundred milligram. I would rather eat like a lead

285
00:18:06,580 --> 00:18:11,160
of you. I thought that you were taking edibles and then going to sleep. No, I

286
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:14,600
bought that for you and that I bought that for you. So every night you can

287
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:18,040
take a little nibble like you're a rabbit. I stopped doing that because I

288
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:21,920
had scary dreams. Yeah, I had scary dreams where I was every night. My dog

289
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:25,600
was dying. Crazy dream. What's been happening? I've been having just like I

290
00:18:25,620 --> 00:18:27,900
I don't know why, but all my dreams have become very vivid.

291
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:29,980
I used to not dream that much at all.

292
00:18:29,980 --> 00:18:33,940
Yeah. And now every single dream that I have, I wake up and I'm like,

293
00:18:33,940 --> 00:18:38,020
Oh my God, I just lived in another universe.

294
00:18:38,020 --> 00:18:40,140
Really? You're doing full Salvia style.

295
00:18:40,140 --> 00:18:41,940
Yeah. I woke up,

296
00:18:41,940 --> 00:18:45,580
I woke up and I thought that I went to a town called Doran, Texas.

297
00:18:45,580 --> 00:18:50,780
And I was walking around telling people like, you know, that's my last name.

298
00:18:50,780 --> 00:18:51,620
Right.

299
00:18:51,620 --> 00:18:54,500
Wait, that's actually so sick.

300
00:18:55,220 --> 00:18:59,120
I went when I was look like you know, no one looked like when I was a kid. I

301
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:04,420
went to town Cameron Montana. No, I got a picture next to the sign. Wow. I've

302
00:19:04,420 --> 00:19:07,620
been having a really crazy issue recently. You know what a dream I had

303
00:19:07,620 --> 00:19:11,420
with my name. I just want to say one one more dream. My head went back in

304
00:19:11,420 --> 00:19:17,220
time and I had my phone. I went back in time through my phone somehow and I

305
00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:21,820
went to the recording studio where Genesis was recording misunderstanding

306
00:19:21,820 --> 00:19:24,820
and they were like, we don't want to put this song out. It's not good.

307
00:19:24,820 --> 00:19:29,820
and I had to show Phil Collins the Wikipedia page for the album Duke,

308
00:19:29,820 --> 00:19:35,060
and I was like, dude, you need to you need to do this. That is actually

309
00:19:35,060 --> 00:19:39,500
good. That is actually the worst and most boring dream I've ever heard in

310
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:42,380
my life. That's not bad at all. What are you talking about? I cannot

311
00:19:42,380 --> 00:19:45,660
believe that that's the kind of thing your subconscious dreams up. What do

312
00:19:45,660 --> 00:19:48,500
you mean? It's like an episode of TV. That is insane.

313
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:53,660
How is that bad? That's cool. I got to meet Phil Collins. I had a dream

314
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:58,240

324
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:44,920
and then I held my Siri button and I went Siri notes app Siri notes app. I

325
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:51,020
I went back in time to Phil Collins and now yeah, she had came in the other

326
00:20:51,020 --> 00:20:54,620
room. She's like who are you on the phone with? Who are you calling Siri on

327
00:20:54,620 --> 00:20:58,380
the phone? Who are you on the phone with talking? No, who is Siri? Who is

328
00:20:58,380 --> 00:21:00,020
this? Who is this bitch?

329
00:21:00,020 --> 00:21:05,220
Wow, that was so he knows that he can 'cause he is using coin. Yeah,

330
00:21:05,220 --> 00:21:08,140
it's like that's what I mean. Like he can literally say whatever he wants.

331
00:21:08,140 --> 00:21:12,140
Yeah, it's so annoying and he misses every single time. That was like 30

332
00:21:12,140 --> 00:21:17,500
because I'm in the middle. Just get a dollar. How hard is it to bring dollars?

333
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:20,980
I have one dollar. Okay, all right. We'll say you better save it and you better

334
00:21:20,980 --> 00:21:22,740
use it. Good. Okay, because

335
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:24,500
you missed,

336
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:29,100
but it was worth it.

337
00:21:29,100 --> 00:21:34,420
And you're not by the way you are not at when we stop recording. You're not

338
00:21:34,420 --> 00:21:37,220
going and getting that dollar. It is going. No, I know it's going in there.

339
00:21:37,220 --> 00:21:40,740
Okay. This is for real. This is money goes to the all money goes to the jar.

340
00:21:40,780 --> 00:21:44,900
this is not for can look how full this jar are yeah. I know we're gonna need

341
00:21:44,900 --> 00:21:53,300
okay, that's pretty that's kind of me me yeah, that's a bit of a me me. Oh my God,

342
00:21:53,300 --> 00:21:56,980
look at this. What do you have? Do you have a loony? I have a nut in here. See

343
00:21:56,980 --> 00:22:01,340
that is like that is just so clear that that you don't even think of that bag as

344
00:22:01,340 --> 00:22:04,860
having money. Yeah, it's not exactly. I literally was going to say that we're

345
00:22:04,860 --> 00:22:08,100
like that's money that you've already you've already sacrificed. Yeah, that is

346
00:22:08,140 --> 00:22:12,380
junk coming. This is my this is my laundry money. That's like that money

347
00:22:12,380 --> 00:22:17,140
is your son who went to the laundromat. That money is your son who went to a

348
00:22:17,140 --> 00:22:21,180
way to war and you just have to assume he's dead. Yeah, until you figure out

349
00:22:21,180 --> 00:22:24,720
you can use a coin star and bring him back to life. That could be a dream

350
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:27,820
that I have. Did you guys ever do coin star growing up? Yeah, I did it a

351
00:22:27,820 --> 00:22:31,580
lot. We would save all year and then put it in the coin star and we always

352
00:22:31,580 --> 00:22:33,540
thought it was going to be like five hundred dollars and it was always like

353
00:22:33,700 --> 00:22:38,060
forty dollars yeah yeah. I did it by hand. I would count out my oh you

354
00:22:38,060 --> 00:22:40,900
rolled it yeah. We did that a couple of times. You roll your own yeah. I roll

355
00:22:40,900 --> 00:22:44,660
my own. That was so it's so annoying when you have a bunch of them yeah. I

356
00:22:44,660 --> 00:22:50,020
thought it was fun. I was a little yeah. God, I would I used to when I when we

357
00:22:50,020 --> 00:22:53,620
were in Boston, I still think it's fun to count coins. You are just so do

358
00:22:53,620 --> 00:22:57,700
little stacks of four quarters something wrong when you hold it in your fingers

359
00:22:57,700 --> 00:23:00,540
like this and you move it back. That's what you think about is a holding it.

360
00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:03,560
it's nice. What do you know what I was doing with that money when I was a kid,

361
00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:08,360
putting it in my mouth, and I was tasting every as well. I was also doing

362
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:12,760
that. And that was the best. I think we were three coin tasters. Pennies taste

363
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:15,940
better than quarters. I think we would have been able to reach across the aisle

364
00:23:15,940 --> 00:23:18,780
of being annoyed by each other and realize that we're all coin tasters.

365
00:23:18,780 --> 00:23:22,200
You should have seen me... I really, really, like when I was younger, I

366
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:26,280
really liked the taste of pennies. I really liked copper. Coins tasted good

367
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:29,040
back then. That's why all my pans... I loved all metal. All my pans are

368
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:32,000
copper. You guys should have seen me at the water fountains. Did I was doing

369
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:37,120
full like Lana Rhoads on the fucking thing of the water fountain, just sucking

370
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:37,560
it in.

371
00:23:37,560 --> 00:23:43,840
I have no dollars and you mentioned Lana Rhoads. That's okay. She's a woman

372
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:49,380
okay. Sexual in nature, please, please give me that dollar, but I put my entire

373
00:23:49,380 --> 00:23:52,480
mouth on the water fountain thing every single time and I would just

374
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:57,920
the the the the the point out. Oh, the spout of the water, the bubble. He's

375
00:23:57,940 --> 00:24:00,840
talking about the bubbler, the bubble, I'll put it my mouth on the bubbler and

376
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:05,220
I would suck it like a nipple, because when I hear water fountain and in the

377
00:24:05,220 --> 00:24:09,860
context of coins, I'm imagining a wishing well. I'm a man really that

378
00:24:09,860 --> 00:24:11,380
serious about bubbler. I

379
00:24:11,380 --> 00:24:17,380
it's not no, it doesn't it's I don't I don't know like when I hear water

380
00:24:17,380 --> 00:24:22,180
fountain, I'm not thinking of the button that you push. What what this is? This

381
00:24:22,180 --> 00:24:27,340
is not our dollar. What is it? This belongs to Tristan. Oh my God, oh mate

382
00:24:27,420 --> 00:24:31,120
come in on the it says Tristan right there. This isn't ours to give. We need

383
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:34,920
to find Tristan. Oh my God, that's who all the money goes to is Tristan. If

384
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:39,420
you're out there, hit us up, hit us up and claim the this dollar other things

385
00:24:39,420 --> 00:24:43,800
that I would eat when I was a kid. I would eat mud pencils mud, but oh, I

386
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:47,420
would chew on pencils for sure. Oh, I do the I would choose my living heck out

387
00:24:47,420 --> 00:24:50,880
of a all of the die out of my sweatshirt sleeves. Yeah, I would suck on my

388
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:55,260
sweatshirt. So yeah, I would my grandmother told me that a kid died from

389
00:24:55,280 --> 00:24:58,480
sucking on his sweatshirt sleeves because it made a ball of dye in his stomach

390
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:01,080
that they had to cut him open and get it out, and it was so big it filled his

391
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:03,440
stomach. I couldn't eat anything. I do believe that. That happens to dogs.

392
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:07,160
When my cousin would get stressed out at a movie, he would suck on his T-shirt.

393
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:10,600
Yeah, that's basically what I would do. Yeah, I would do T-shirt collars,

394
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:14,760
jacket sleeves, sweatshirt sleeves. Oh, the... In a hoodie, the string in a

395
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:17,480
hoodie. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Put that in your dang mouth. Oh, my God, all the

396
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:21,200
way down the throat. Yeah, exactly. Yeah. I would suck on chocolate chips as

397
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:23,340
the kid yeah, I would look on lollipop

398
00:25:23,340 --> 00:25:27,700
jawbreakers. I'd have a big jawbreaker hanging out of the side of my mouth.

399
00:25:27,700 --> 00:25:33,060
Basically, it was so that rancher not really jolly rancher and aid candy. No,

400
00:25:33,060 --> 00:25:35,200
I will. I remember really do

401
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:37,600
band aid. There's a

402
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:40,520
that looked like band aids.

403
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:45,440
No, it was like you ate you ate band aids. I did not eat band. You ate a

404
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:51,180
look. There's been gummy aid. Whoa! Oh, there was that's. Well,

405
00:25:51,180 --> 00:25:53,820
so that's when that's when parents complained about candy cigarettes and

406
00:25:53,820 --> 00:25:56,100
they're like well, we're making the boxes. Yeah,

407
00:25:56,100 --> 00:26:00,980
yeah, we already have it. We already have the factory to make boxes that look

408
00:26:00,980 --> 00:26:01,780
like things

409
00:26:01,780 --> 00:26:07,420
we can just switch it. A strange switch from cigarette

410
00:26:07,420 --> 00:26:13,180
to lever. There's only two sides. If you leave that lever in the middle,

411
00:26:13,180 --> 00:26:15,100
it's going to look crazy. I

412
00:26:17,300 --> 00:26:21,700
really was not a huge candy man growing up, but I liked can deal. I me and my

413
00:26:21,700 --> 00:26:22,140
friends

414
00:26:22,140 --> 00:26:27,240
had basically an ed ed and eddy routine where we would literally go through the

415
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:30,660
entire school day trying to find coins in some way or another, and then we'd

416
00:26:30,660 --> 00:26:34,100
stop at the corner store on the way home when walking from school and we get

417
00:26:34,100 --> 00:26:37,540
candy. There's a be like, yes, I have twenty five cents a day. I could get

418
00:26:37,540 --> 00:26:41,720
lemon heads really annoying, simpler time lemon, beautiful. Why did we like

419
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:44,860
lemon head? I liked the what do you tell it about? Cherry heads get me

420
00:26:45,180 --> 00:26:49,740
I loved Lemonhead. I loved Lemonhead. I talked about it before. I liked the Lemonhead character design.

421
00:26:49,740 --> 00:26:53,420
I was like, there should be a TV show of them. Yeah, we did talk about that before.

422
00:26:53,420 --> 00:26:59,500
There's this really annoying kid in my class named Kyle and he went on a rant to the teacher one day.

423
00:26:59,500 --> 00:27:04,220
He was like, I went to the penny candy store. There was like, it was like one of the last

424
00:27:04,220 --> 00:27:11,420
surviving penny candy stores in the country and I went there and guess what? Because of

425
00:27:11,420 --> 00:27:17,960
Massachusetts taxes, the candy was fifty one cents. It's a penny candy store. A

426
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:21,740
kid should never be saying the phrase one of the last surviving. That's how

427
00:27:21,740 --> 00:27:26,160
you know a kid needs to be smacked around. That kid was annoyed out of and

428
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:27,940
he would sing that Comcast song.

429
00:27:27,940 --> 00:27:35,000
What's the Comcast? It was like C. O. M. C. A. S. T. Now I did a really

430
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:40,180
monotone. I don't know it. I wish I wish now that I heard it. I wish now that I

431
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:45,240
I had a lot more. Yeah, there's a lot of those sicko nerds grew up and you were

432
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:46,960
doing that stuff. You were home schooled.

433
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:50,560
So how are you gonna always home schooled? I had I got plenty of bullying

434
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:55,440
in and middle school. Yeah, yeah, you're making life hell for some Christian

435
00:27:55,440 --> 00:28:00,240
ruined probably thirty full lives. Yeah, when I was a child, yeah, thirty full

436
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:05,360
lives and I and forever, you know, but some of them escaped and some of them

437
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:09,440
had pretty decent lives after. And so what I wish that I'd done is gone when

438
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:14,280
when they found out when they before school shooting yeah. So I had no fear

439
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:19,280
now. This is after I had no I was a real is a taller than you. I'm gonna. I

440
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:24,320
will when you when they found out that you were getting home schooled yeah. It

441
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:25,040
was like

442
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:29,400
the end of Return of the Jedi. It was like the end of World War Two. Yeah,

443
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:33,960
yeah, everyone's all dancing. It was me dying in a bunker by myself and they

444
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:35,440
were like, Oh, my God,

445
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:36,640
we

446
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:44,520
I had the realization like literally probably a couple of weeks ago yeah

447
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:48,880
that all along I thought I was a nerd. You were a I was a bully yeah, yeah, I

448
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:49,200
was just

449
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:53,840
everybody grows. I was the I was the bully who bullied all the people who

450
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:57,000
were more nerdy than me yeah, well, just you realize that you were just like

451
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:00,480
kids are just so because every once in a while, like what have every once in a

452
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:02,920
while I'll just be like oh yeah, I'll be telling some story about high school,

453
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:05,100
and be like oh yeah, this kid that we all used to like torture and make

454
00:29:05,100 --> 00:29:10,000
like put finally put it all together. I was like wait. Well, that's what the

455
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:14,280
whole thing is. I don't have like what is it? There's not none of those kids

456
00:29:14,280 --> 00:29:17,780
were nice. Yeah, all of those kids had one kid. There probably was one kid at

457
00:29:17,780 --> 00:29:21,280
the very bottom and yeah, you had one. We got

458
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:26,740
yeah, but then we had a few and but if it was today, you would not be able to

459
00:29:26,740 --> 00:29:27,720
bully. No yeah,

460
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:32,340
literally I think yeah, it's completely true. There's some of this some of the

461
00:29:32,360 --> 00:29:36,560
stuff that other people did that I was not part of was like like a hundred

462
00:29:36,560 --> 00:29:40,000
percent would really it would be what did they do? People would freak out

463
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:43,040
about it. There were they like made there were these kids who made like a

464
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:43,640
fake

465
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:48,840
when you remember Google Plus. They made a fake Google Plus profile for this

466
00:29:48,840 --> 00:29:49,280
kid

467
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:56,880
and they and they already they were they posted the craziest shit on there and

468
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:57,720
they dollar

469
00:29:57,720 --> 00:30:00,280
gosh darn it.

470
00:30:01,320 --> 00:30:05,280
they posted a bunch of just talking about ruining a kid's life and still

471
00:30:05,280 --> 00:30:05,640
putting a

472
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:10,520
well. This is

473
00:30:10,520 --> 00:30:12,080
this was middle.

474
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:17,420
Google first came out, this was when everyone was on it. I did not know a

475
00:30:17,420 --> 00:30:20,780
single person. You were whack. They all the cool kids, exactly the cool kids

476
00:30:20,780 --> 00:30:25,640
are on Google plus it was so bad. It was it was like bad to the level of like

477
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:28,520
there was a whole there was like an administrative thing in the school.

478
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:32,240
Oh man, they like remember any of the posts yeah they posted. I'm trying to

479
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:33,560
remember. I feel like they probably

480
00:30:33,560 --> 00:30:37,280
I can't remember anything word for word, but the thing I remember that really got

481
00:30:37,280 --> 00:30:43,480
them in trouble is they started posting a bunch of P O R N O G R A P H Y with

482
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:44,720
captions like I love this.

483
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:46,800
There was a

484
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:52,800
P O R N O R. No, actually it wasn't. It was it was really fun. It was just

485
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:57,120
normal. It was yeah, the kid, though he yeah he didn't deserve that there were

486
00:30:57,140 --> 00:31:03,220
did he ever these kids at my school that were making fake Facebook pages of

487
00:31:03,220 --> 00:31:07,620
teachers in the school. They were like they were

488
00:31:07,620 --> 00:31:15,780
they all impersonated our gym teacher, Mr. Noon, and all the posts are like I'm

489
00:31:15,780 --> 00:31:16,820
going on a run

490
00:31:16,820 --> 00:31:19,380
and stuff like that.

491
00:31:19,380 --> 00:31:26,300
I'm doing pull ups, I'm doing monkey bars.

492
00:31:26,340 --> 00:31:30,000
and they fed they like I guess they like took a picture of him in school and

493
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:34,180
then like oh man, he was kind of like an agro dude and like

494
00:31:34,180 --> 00:31:40,800
found out about that and was livid and all those kids got suspended for do

495
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:44,840
you ever see the videos just to give context to about this innocent this kid

496
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:47,660
that they were torturing Google plus this like the main thing I remember

497
00:31:47,660 --> 00:31:51,320
about this kid is that he was it was probably like seventh or eighth grade

498
00:31:51,620 --> 00:31:57,380
and he like every day would read the graphic novel of the Bible. Oh wow! I

499
00:31:57,380 --> 00:31:57,780
know that

500
00:31:57,780 --> 00:32:01,080
yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, I

501
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:06,500
do remember I did get in a fist fight about atheism versus Christianity when I

502
00:32:06,500 --> 00:32:06,660
was

503
00:32:06,660 --> 00:32:10,700
yeah, because my friend Jesse said which side were you on to

504
00:32:10,700 --> 00:32:16,740
come on. You know that I was a straight crusader warrior for God, yeah, and I

505
00:32:16,820 --> 00:32:20,160
lost pretty bad, about a foot taller than me and

506
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:24,540
basically I said that his mom was going to hell and he got really mad and I was

507
00:32:24,540 --> 00:32:28,180
like who gives a crap you don't even believe in hell yeah exactly. Why would

508
00:32:28,180 --> 00:32:32,660
he care? Yeah here came out old righty and lefty yeah. I threw the first punch

509
00:32:32,660 --> 00:32:36,060
and I immediately got you through the first punch. Wow yeah dude, that's the

510
00:32:36,060 --> 00:32:39,900
Christian code to say your mom is going to a t double hockey sticks and then

511
00:32:39,900 --> 00:32:43,580
punch him well because we were talking about abortion. Oh, so that wasn't the

512
00:32:43,620 --> 00:32:46,740
first thing, you know it's started with a portion. It's really cool that when

513
00:32:46,740 --> 00:32:48,760
you were like eleven or whatever you were like

514
00:32:48,760 --> 00:32:52,820
I need to I need to talk about I was a culture warrior. So

515
00:32:52,820 --> 00:32:56,200
here's the things these are things that did not play about okay

516
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:58,080
abortion,

517
00:32:58,080 --> 00:33:00,580
the United States debt. Yes,

518
00:33:00,580 --> 00:33:07,660
marijuana laws. I didn't want marijuana legalized because I did even as a child.

519
00:33:07,660 --> 00:33:10,940
I knew that that was just wrong. Yeah, I saw super high me when I was in

520
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:17,220
freshman year of high school, and I was like we need to make this s h i t

521
00:33:17,220 --> 00:33:21,820
legal yeah and and also I did not like cussing yeah. I did not like cussing

522
00:33:21,820 --> 00:33:25,560
until I lost my faith. Yeah, but the entire time that I was a faithful

523
00:33:25,560 --> 00:33:29,680
Christian, I did not want to remember. I thought a lot of humor was disgusting.

524
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:33,120
It is until I was twenty three. It still makes me want to vomit. Yeah, I

525
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:36,400
don't know why we've been doing. I mean I'm glad that it's it ends today. It's

526
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:40,160
over. I just remembered. I just remembered also the the reason they got

527
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:45,640
a lot of trouble is that they had, along with Mr. Noon, was like a network of other teachers.

528
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:48,640
So they were all just impersonating the teachers.

529
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:49,640
Wow.

530
00:33:49,640 --> 00:33:50,640
They had a whole fake Facebook.

531
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:53,200
They had a whole fake Facebook thing.

532
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:54,200
That's crazy.

533
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:58,200
And it was Mr. Noon and Mrs. Harmon, who was the home ec teacher.

534
00:33:58,200 --> 00:33:59,200
What a perfect name.

535
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:00,200
And all the most...

536
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:01,200
Was she beautiful?

537
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:02,200
No.

538
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:03,920
She was an old German woman.

539
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:06,920
We had a lady named Mrs. Lovejoy.

540
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:07,920
Mrs. Lovejoy.

541
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:08,920
Wow.

542
00:34:08,920 --> 00:34:09,920
Wow.

543
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:13,880
his Harman's Facebook. I remember he's remember how you could have usernames

544
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:16,880
hers was it was

545
00:34:16,880 --> 00:34:21,400
the username they got for her was wooden spoon,

546
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:25,200
because she's the she's like the cooking teacher. You did not

547
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:30,240
you did not go to school very creative children. No, no, they were not very

548
00:34:30,240 --> 00:34:34,160
funny that what he that is so funny idea is funny, but when you said that they

549
00:34:34,160 --> 00:34:37,280
went on the P teacher's thing and said I'm going for a run.

550
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:44,520
that is funny. That is really funny. Yeah, that is really funny because that's

551
00:34:44,520 --> 00:34:45,140
the only

552
00:34:45,140 --> 00:34:52,800
he's who you think is looping and jumping rope all day.

553
00:34:52,800 --> 00:35:00,260
Do you guys think you could have been teachers? No, no, no, but you maybe I

554
00:35:00,260 --> 00:35:04,520
don't know. I wouldn't want to be. I don't think I was a teacher and you if

555
00:35:04,540 --> 00:35:09,040
you have it. If you grow up with a teacher in your life, yes, there is

556
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:12,520
miserable all the time. It doesn't I don't understand how you could ever want

557
00:35:12,520 --> 00:35:17,240
to be a teacher. Sounds I agree, even if you're just a kid in a teacher's class,

558
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:20,440
yeah, can you look at that's that that you know what that is that's you have

559
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:23,900
some kind of malfunction in your brain where you're like you know what someday

560
00:35:23,900 --> 00:35:28,100
I want to have power over this for a future version child. There's so many

561
00:35:28,100 --> 00:35:30,340
there's so many teachers that like

562
00:35:31,260 --> 00:35:35,520
you can tell like, okay, you got into this profession like you they hang out

563
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:38,660
with like all the cool kids in school and it's like, oh, you got into this

564
00:35:38,660 --> 00:35:43,140
profession because if you care, you were trying to continue your popularity or

565
00:35:43,140 --> 00:35:46,460
you weren't popular and now you want to be if you care like a little enough

566
00:35:46,460 --> 00:35:50,580
about money or and stress to become a teacher, there's something wrong with you.

567
00:35:50,580 --> 00:35:54,700
You should become instead a monk, yeah, that'd be a much or a police officer or

568
00:35:54,700 --> 00:36:00,140
a monkey or a police officer or a human or a specially ops agent like green

569
00:36:00,180 --> 00:36:04,920
race style yeah, but I also think that this the being a teacher so hard

570
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:09,820
because you spend all of this time with these kids that just completely stink.

571
00:36:09,820 --> 00:36:14,180
I'm not going to say that, but they stink and then you finally find one

572
00:36:14,180 --> 00:36:17,680
that is like really, really good honor student, really curious kid and they

573
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:21,480
always get hit by a stray bullet or die in a driving accident yeah, and then

574
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:26,100
you know it just happens every four years. The but they do get a page in the

575
00:36:26,100 --> 00:36:29,140
yearbook, so it's all worth it. Well, but then yeah, then you then like every

576
00:36:29,180 --> 00:36:32,500
four years, you're just you're just going. What was a quote I had about the

577
00:36:32,500 --> 00:36:34,320
kid four years ago got hit in the head by

578
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:39,660
got attacked by a hawk and then you're just copying and pasting that under

579
00:36:39,660 --> 00:36:44,220
black and white photo. You know what the bit one of the biggest like Shane like

580
00:36:44,220 --> 00:36:47,660
I'm thinking about like the cool art teacher like when you're in school and

581
00:36:47,660 --> 00:36:51,100
think about the cool art teacher and I think back to like the cool art teacher

582
00:36:51,100 --> 00:36:54,500
and like that's not right. I told you guys about right evil to be

583
00:36:55,660 --> 00:36:58,840
high school art teacher, right? Yeah, yeah, the guy the guy that was in

584
00:36:58,840 --> 00:36:59,260
like a

585
00:36:59,260 --> 00:37:03,440
web series where he's a vampire hunter. If you're talking, if you're talking

586
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:07,480
to the kids about magic, the gathering or your you're you're bringing in

587
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:08,180
guitar hero,

588
00:37:08,180 --> 00:37:11,860
and you're allowed to go outside and smoke, you bring in guitar hero,

589
00:37:11,860 --> 00:37:15,780
Metallica on the day before Christmas break and you make the whole class

590
00:37:15,780 --> 00:37:20,720
watch you get. That's actually a master of that. That's cool. One hundred

591
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:25,060
percent. That's a cool. That is that's that's what that's what my art teacher

592
00:37:25,080 --> 00:37:30,520
seventh grade Mr. Stumpf did. And you're like, this guy's really cool. He liked

593
00:37:30,520 --> 00:37:32,680
tool. He would come in wearing tool t-shirts all the time. This is not

594
00:37:32,680 --> 00:37:37,160
something like the cool art teacher. I'm talking about the art teacher. He was

595
00:37:37,160 --> 00:37:42,800
ripped. He was handsome too. He started to sound cool to me. Wait, I've seen a

596
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:48,600
picture of this guy. He was ripped. I showed you his vampire web series. No,

597
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:51,440
you just showed me a picture of him. Oh yeah. And he was shredded. Fourteen year

598
00:37:51,460 --> 00:37:55,260
Neil Patrick seeing a guy played guitar here. I'm talking about a vampire.

599
00:37:55,260 --> 00:38:00,000
I was twelve. This is the coolest guy. I will do it. Yeah, he was like every

600
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:05,140
single mom in the in the PTA was like and that Mr. Stumpf,

601
00:38:05,140 --> 00:38:11,460
they all wanted to. They all wanted to well here. I l him. The art teachers are

602
00:38:11,460 --> 00:38:15,880
all the art teachers are that is a there should not be an art class in school.

603
00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:16,580
No, there should

604
00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:23,920
but it should be taught by a robot. Yes, or the kids, the kids should be

605
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:26,920
teaching. It should be taught by one. Yeah,

606
00:38:26,920 --> 00:38:32,080
there should not be art. There should not be English. It should only be

607
00:38:32,080 --> 00:38:36,720
it's only be math taxes. How to meet your spouse? Yeah,

608
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:42,260
yeah, we're dancing class. Wait, if the kids design the curriculum where the

609
00:38:42,260 --> 00:38:42,920
kids, by the way,

610
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:47,400
we got to do eight classes. Yeah, I know we've done this before, but I think

611
00:38:47,420 --> 00:38:52,060
we did our individual ones. What are we actually if we if they put us on the

612
00:38:52,060 --> 00:38:56,420
board of the New York State School, like school board first time to read versus

613
00:38:56,420 --> 00:39:00,220
taxes, how to do your taxes, you don't need that there's turn. No, yeah, how to

614
00:39:00,220 --> 00:39:03,940
do your taxes, plus how to how to tip at restaurants. No,

615
00:39:03,940 --> 00:39:10,820
no, how to treat servers with respect. No, I'm not even looking at you. No, no,

616
00:39:10,820 --> 00:39:13,660
no, that you think that's right, but put a book on

617
00:39:15,180 --> 00:39:17,940
the world, but would not be involved by the way you're getting. You're getting

618
00:39:17,940 --> 00:39:21,100
five words of what this is. This is an impression of the current New York

619
00:39:21,100 --> 00:39:22,220
State. Okay, go ahead.

620
00:39:22,220 --> 00:39:29,180
We're going to teach a class on how to draw Steven Universe.

621
00:39:29,180 --> 00:39:36,260
Okay, you use your woke by words very well. Yeah, that was good. That was good,

622
00:39:36,260 --> 00:39:39,540
but yeah, that's basically what it is right now. It's how to draw Steven

678
00:43:13,400 --> 00:43:18,400
Almost ninety nine percent of that money is going to hire the most talented

698
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:36,420
aim. Can I talk a little? I know we're not at the end of the day, but I want

699
00:44:36,420 --> 00:44:40,280
to talk a little bit about how the transport system works. You go to and

700
00:44:40,280 --> 00:44:43,200
from school. I'd like to explain this to you guys. There's a tube. Yes. So

701
00:44:43,200 --> 00:44:46,520
there's a tube that you hop in at the end of the day, and it takes you to

702
00:44:46,520 --> 00:44:50,660
what you might think is your home. Yes, it looks exactly like your home. Your

703
00:44:50,660 --> 00:44:53,840
mom seems to be there. Your dad seems to be there. Your little brother's there.

704
00:44:53,840 --> 00:44:58,720
They're acting a little weird, a little mechanical, but they seem to be there.

705
00:44:58,720 --> 00:45:02,200
That's right. You will never be truly home. We've constructed one to one

706
00:45:02,200 --> 00:45:05,760
replicas of every student's home to make sure we can completely control their

707
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:09,320
environment, make sure their homework is getting done, make sure that they are

708
00:45:09,320 --> 00:45:14,920
doing their sleep cycle. Mom has a belt that has a cattle prod attached to it.

709
00:45:14,960 --> 00:45:18,620
we have a don't do your homework. Mom's going to your that's right. We replace

710
00:45:18,620 --> 00:45:24,000
mom with M O M and D A D. Yeah, an acti key New York style, simulatory reality.

711
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:27,540
Yeah, you are going to be walking around. We're going to have people playing you

712
00:45:27,540 --> 00:45:30,340
who are playing somebody else. You're going to see yourself when you get

713
00:45:30,340 --> 00:45:30,780
yeah,

714
00:45:30,780 --> 00:45:36,660
the actor playing you, the robots don't know that it's training and then also

715
00:45:36,660 --> 00:45:40,380
every day when you get home, you have to battle. You have to battle to keep your

716
00:45:40,380 --> 00:45:44,060
spot in the family against yourself. Yeah, if you don't do well at school that

717
00:45:44,100 --> 00:45:47,900
day. Yes, who's going to school for you? Your clone, your

718
00:45:47,900 --> 00:45:51,060
no, not a clone. Yes, where and guess where you are watching.

719
00:45:51,060 --> 00:45:55,300
You are watching from the chamber and you all know what the chamber looks

720
00:45:55,300 --> 00:45:58,640
like. Guess what happens if you if you're if your robot clone goes to

721
00:45:58,640 --> 00:46:02,140
school and you get sent away. Guess where you're getting sent. That's right

722
00:46:02,140 --> 00:46:05,260
outer space. Yeah, I know that sounds maybe cool and fun. Oh, I got to go

723
00:46:05,260 --> 00:46:09,500
to a space station, but no. Have you ever seen Star Wars? Yeah, trash scene.

724
00:46:09,500 --> 00:46:11,980
That's what's happening. You're going to the trash room and there's no cool

725
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:17,140
monster there to admire? No. And if and we do, why would you even admire that?

726
00:46:17,140 --> 00:46:20,080
Well, let's talk about corporal punishment. Okay, because corporal

727
00:46:20,080 --> 00:46:23,580
punishment is less... We don't believe in that here. No, we believe in it to

728
00:46:23,580 --> 00:46:25,900
the maximum. Have you ever seen... No, no, no, no, 'cause there's no such

729
00:46:25,900 --> 00:46:28,260
thing as corporal punishment, it's called tough love. We believe in... That's

730
00:46:28,260 --> 00:46:28,640
right.

731
00:46:28,640 --> 00:46:33,600
That is right. We believe in incorporeal punishment, where we have a room that

732
00:46:33,600 --> 00:46:37,200
we have confirmed is haunted, and if you misbehave, we send you in there,

733
00:46:37,200 --> 00:46:40,520
and ethereal spirits will come down and possess your body and... And they will

734
00:46:40,560 --> 00:46:44,080
actually torture you until the day they will edge you yeah

735
00:46:44,080 --> 00:46:44,800
they'll force you to

736
00:46:44,800 --> 00:46:50,960
for hours. It's torturous. You don't want to go there. This is in a middle

737
00:46:50,960 --> 00:46:53,900
school. This is a college. That's why the sexual it's a middle. Well, no,

738
00:46:53,900 --> 00:46:57,120
they're ghosts. They're not good people. Yeah, okay, it goes probably go

739
00:46:57,120 --> 00:47:00,960
somewhere wandering. The earth goes happen to do yeah exactly and

740
00:47:00,960 --> 00:47:06,860

747
00:47:34,120 --> 00:47:38,160
The Chokey is a sensory deprivation tank. By the way, after

748
00:47:38,160 --> 00:47:42,900
after deprivation tank, so you think because you have VR goggles on yeah, so

749
00:47:42,900 --> 00:47:46,200
all you see is like you hear like the drips of water and you see it's

750
00:47:46,200 --> 00:47:51,200
completely dark until out of nowhere, just like a faceless like Xenomorph

751
00:47:51,200 --> 00:47:51,880
looking like the

752
00:47:51,880 --> 00:47:56,280
half human Xenomorph comes up, runs at you and just goes

754
00:47:59,860 --> 00:48:02,480
put on the you don't. So in this situation, you don't know you're being

755
00:48:02,520 --> 00:48:04,920
dishonest yet. Okay, like okay, we don't usually have any games. You want to

756
00:48:04,920 --> 00:48:08,160
play a video game? Yeah, you're like okay, yeah, I guess I'm getting rewarded.

757
00:48:08,160 --> 00:48:13,360
You put on the VR headset. It's Mario. Yeah, you're in Mario one and you're

758
00:48:13,360 --> 00:48:17,040

00:48:17,040 --> 00:48:20,560
Yeah, you're in the chokie. You jump. Yeah, you've been in the chokie all

760
00:48:20,560 --> 00:48:24,720
along. You think you might be on a treadmill or in a wide open field? No,

761
00:48:24,720 --> 00:48:28,560
you're in a room filled with glass and nails and you jump. You're going to get

762
00:48:28,600 --> 00:48:32,280
like a bit of a haircut and also you are a Goomba.

763
00:48:32,280 --> 00:48:34,960
Oh my God, the world

764
00:48:34,960 --> 00:48:39,460
you're like, oh no, Goomba, I'm scared you take off the VR goggles. The Goomba

765
00:48:39,460 --> 00:48:41,760
was not VR. I know there's a real

766
00:48:41,760 --> 00:48:47,860
eyes. Yeah, we put a real Goomba in the school. We have a Goomba that we

767
00:48:47,860 --> 00:48:52,240
created through science and it escaped the science lab. Yeah, it was a person

768
00:48:52,240 --> 00:48:52,840
before we

769
00:48:55,340 --> 00:48:59,500
a person. We've heard one of the kids into a goomba really bad like like

770
00:48:59,500 --> 00:49:03,580
tusk. It was like a man and then we put him in a box that was shaped like a

771
00:49:03,580 --> 00:49:07,020
goomba. We should do that movie, but about a guy who's obsessed

772
00:49:07,020 --> 00:49:13,060
and he turns just along into a that's way better. That's a way better idea

773
00:49:13,060 --> 00:49:17,020
for a movie that is, but then also after crossfit training, there is a

774
00:49:17,020 --> 00:49:19,460
sensory deprivation tank and we will play

775
00:49:19,460 --> 00:49:24,340
crimson and clover over and over and over again. After the sensory deprivation

776
00:49:24,380 --> 00:49:27,780
tank. There's a sensory overload tank where it stimulates all your senses at

777
00:49:27,780 --> 00:49:30,360
once for an hour straight. We basically put you into an episode of Johnny

778
00:49:30,360 --> 00:49:33,180
Tess. It tickles you and it pumps flavors into your mouth and it puts

779
00:49:33,180 --> 00:49:34,960
cells into your nose and it smells. There's like a sweet and sour back and

780
00:49:34,960 --> 00:49:38,420
forth. It smells a thousand times. You're going through, it is like you're

781
00:49:38,420 --> 00:49:43,340
going through the E.T. Ride at Universal at five times speed over and over

782
00:49:43,340 --> 00:49:46,580
again. And it has, the flavors are, it's a Gatling gun that just alternates

783
00:49:46,580 --> 00:49:49,600
like sweet, sour, umami. But it's also, yeah, it has, well, it also, it has

784
00:49:49,600 --> 00:49:53,080
AI in there, so it can tell when you're getting, if you get too used to

785
00:49:53,100 --> 00:49:56,620
the cycle, you're getting a little desensitized. Okay, now bitter, yes,

786
00:49:56,620 --> 00:49:59,900
throw better in there. Yeah, bitter toothpaste, salty, yes, salt.

787
00:49:59,900 --> 00:50:01,180
Basically, it's

788
00:50:01,180 --> 00:50:02,500
what

789
00:50:02,500 --> 00:50:06,100
into your mouth.

790
00:50:06,100 --> 00:50:10,860
Yeah, yeah, and then, yes, it was created by

791
00:50:10,860 --> 00:50:16,660
aperture of science for for your ears. It's probably playing some messed up

792
00:50:16,660 --> 00:50:21,940
noise sound like Jesus. Yeah, yeah, playing some death metal, like ghost or

793
00:50:21,980 --> 00:50:27,480
like on this side on this year, it's goes day to remember on this year. It's a

794
00:50:27,480 --> 00:50:31,700
classic backer. Act Bert backer act. Do you know the way to say

795
00:50:31,700 --> 00:50:38,180
that's right? The machine story. That's on the other. There's a cochlear implant

796
00:50:38,180 --> 00:50:41,340
on the back. Also, for your eyes, it's playing the machine movie.

797
00:50:41,340 --> 00:50:47,740
And it's and it the machine movie. It has the commentary track done by Mark

798
00:50:47,740 --> 00:50:50,780
Hamill and he's doing it in the Joker's voice. I just have a really good if

799
00:50:50,780 --> 00:50:54,380
if they were going to reboot the twilight zone, okay, you go you're going to a

800
00:50:54,380 --> 00:50:56,080
movie theater, you say to me that it's got a machine

801
00:50:56,080 --> 00:51:01,880
you go to the movie theater to see the machine. Yeah, you sit down, it starts

802
00:51:01,880 --> 00:51:05,100
playing, you're like it's playing oddly slowly. It seems like it's playing a

803
00:51:05,100 --> 00:51:08,620
point a one percent speed and it's going so slow. I better leave this is going to

804
00:51:08,620 --> 00:51:12,380
take too long to watch you go to leave. The doors are locked. Whoa! You have to

805
00:51:12,380 --> 00:51:14,540
watch the whole thing at very slowly

806
00:51:14,540 --> 00:51:17,180
exactly

807
00:51:20,460 --> 00:51:24,180
you guys kind of feel pissed off that they never asked us to write on that

808
00:51:24,180 --> 00:51:27,500
movie. Yeah, I do well. They asked me and I turned it down because they didn't

809
00:51:27,500 --> 00:51:28,700
ask you guys. That's really

810
00:51:28,700 --> 00:51:33,900
we wrote that on the show two years ago. We wrote the machine. I mean we saw okay,

811
00:51:33,900 --> 00:51:38,300
so we wrote a different for people who don't know. We wrote about an inventor.

812
00:51:38,300 --> 00:51:43,220
We wrote the machine for Bert, probably five or six years ago. We wrote it as a

813
00:51:43,220 --> 00:51:47,700
stand up, but he came to us and we used to he used to like right and have us sit

814
00:51:47,740 --> 00:51:51,180
on a couch and kind of like pitch stuff and then one day we were like yeah. We

815
00:51:51,180 --> 00:51:54,380
just have this crazy idea for like a thing that you could do. Well, what

816
00:51:54,380 --> 00:51:57,380
we're going to happen, we said we have this crazy idea that we're going to do

817
00:51:57,380 --> 00:52:01,700
yeah in our trio act yeah. He was like well actually it wasn't even an idea.

818
00:52:01,700 --> 00:52:06,100
It was something that actually happened to us. Yeah, we actually had my idea.

819
00:52:06,100 --> 00:52:09,980
Basically, I'm at memory. Yeah, half three, the one third of it happened to

820
00:52:09,980 --> 00:52:12,420
Caleb, one third of it happened to me and then one third of it happened to

821
00:52:12,420 --> 00:52:16,260
came. The part that happened to me was I was on a train yeah and the part that

822
00:52:16,300 --> 00:52:19,420
happened to me was I went to college. Yes, and then all the other stuff

823
00:52:19,420 --> 00:52:23,820
all the other stuff. The Russian mafia and that was just his life.

824
00:52:23,820 --> 00:52:26,580
That was just his life. Yeah, so he had kind of a crazy life,

825
00:52:26,580 --> 00:52:29,460
but one day we were like, let's put all this together. Let's incorporate

826
00:52:29,460 --> 00:52:32,060
college and the train. And the train with his life. Yeah, 'cause I was

827
00:52:32,060 --> 00:52:34,820
like, this story will never work 'cause it doesn't have a college or

828
00:52:34,820 --> 00:52:37,780
the train. Yeah. Nobody will be able to relate to the story. Exactly.

829
00:52:37,780 --> 00:52:41,220
Yeah, and then we did it. Yeah. And then for a while, we were...

830
00:52:41,220 --> 00:52:44,900
It was a one man play. A three man, one man. A three man, one man.

831
00:52:44,900 --> 00:52:49,900
One man show that we were all in one big pair of pants together.

832
00:52:49,900 --> 00:52:51,900
Yeah, it was also about weight loss.

833
00:52:51,900 --> 00:52:53,900
Because at the end we take the pair of pants and we say,

834
00:52:53,900 --> 00:52:55,900
"Look at how much weight we've lost."

835
00:52:55,900 --> 00:52:57,900
And we also have our shirts off when we do it.

836
00:52:57,900 --> 00:53:00,900
By the way, you guys should come to our next live show

837
00:53:00,900 --> 00:53:03,900
because we will be showing you how much extra skin we have from our weight loss.

838
00:53:03,900 --> 00:53:05,900
We'll be hiding audiences.

839
00:53:05,900 --> 00:53:10,900
Once we get back on that road, I'm going to be showing you my nipple skin.

840
00:53:10,900 --> 00:53:16,660
is like it. I like because I know that we're not going to get sexual. Yeah,

841
00:53:16,660 --> 00:53:21,060
don't get sick. We're not getting sexual, but the what my nipple skin looks like

842
00:53:21,060 --> 00:53:25,500
and I'm going to get into. Yeah, just say this is medical. This is medical.

843
00:53:25,500 --> 00:53:30,260
This is medical. Say it. My nipple skin looks like an uncircumcised penis. Okay,

844
00:53:30,260 --> 00:53:34,900
from the back and I from the back, you can see my my butt looks like bunny ears.

845
00:53:34,900 --> 00:53:40,620
Oh wow. Yeah, it goes all the way down. I have two uncircumcised penises on my

846
00:53:40,660 --> 00:53:45,220
my chest and when I do that, you have penis is sexual. We said no sexual

847
00:53:45,220 --> 00:53:48,400
gestures and you literally just did that when you talk about penis. We're

848
00:53:48,400 --> 00:53:51,840
talking about a comical. You think doing this on a penis is not sexual? No,

849
00:53:51,840 --> 00:53:52,360
I'm saying

850
00:53:52,360 --> 00:53:59,000
that you justify all that stuff you do to yourself. No, it's true. You as a man

851
00:53:59,000 --> 00:53:59,620
who has an

852
00:53:59,620 --> 00:54:06,660
is not sexual. When I pull the skin back to pee, it is you feel it and you feel

853
00:54:06,820 --> 00:54:07,320
good.

854
00:54:07,320 --> 00:54:12,660
That's what I say when I pull it back. That's so sexual. That's incredibly

855
00:54:12,660 --> 00:54:18,600
I'd like to say just that I we wrote this thing for Bert and then it was just

856
00:54:18,600 --> 00:54:22,060
like we kind of didn't hear about it for a while. He starts doing on the road.

857
00:54:22,060 --> 00:54:25,980
We're like yeah, whatever. It's fine. He gave us like five hundred bucks and

858
00:54:25,980 --> 00:54:29,980
then we saw the trailer for the movie five hundred. Yeah, you don't remember

859
00:54:29,980 --> 00:54:35,860
that. I don't think I only got five hundred. Oh well, you got more. You got

860
00:54:35,880 --> 00:54:41,080
more than that. How much did you get or you mean you got five hundred mil right?

861
00:54:41,080 --> 00:54:45,840
I did chill. There's no way you make five hundred million dollars. No, I

862
00:54:45,840 --> 00:54:50,200
didn't make I made I made five hundred dollars. I made nothing. You didn't make

863
00:54:50,200 --> 00:54:53,320
anything. You should probably talk to him about that. I thought that we all was

864
00:54:53,320 --> 00:54:58,320
that well, you didn't send. He did not send an invoice. Yeah, you did not. I

865
00:54:58,320 --> 00:55:02,680
thought invoice me whatever. I put a million dollars. He was saying he was

866
00:55:02,700 --> 00:55:05,460
saying send me an invoice and then I was like oh sorry.

867
00:55:05,460 --> 00:55:07,580
Where are we going to get paid?

868
00:55:07,580 --> 00:55:13,600
Yeah, that I could see the confusion. Yeah, I thought he was telling me to use

869
00:55:13,600 --> 00:55:17,860
my invoice, but then they do this movie and basically they the machine like I

870
00:55:17,860 --> 00:55:23,420
hate to say it has gone Hollywood. Yeah, Mark Hamill's in it. He I mean the

871
00:55:23,420 --> 00:55:27,160
biggest the biggest celebrity in the world, Mark yeah, because he was the

872
00:55:27,160 --> 00:55:28,180
joker. Yeah, I mean

873
00:55:28,980 --> 00:55:33,480
I I just I feel I mean Mark Hamill from body bags. Yeah, of course, yeah, I

874
00:55:33,480 --> 00:55:38,100
feel crappy because like you, you took the no you crappy is okay. I know I'm

875
00:55:38,100 --> 00:55:41,940
just I'm I'm just that's a hand of that's a that's a you know you're

876
00:55:41,940 --> 00:55:45,460
making your life cap cap cap. Yeah, that's cab. That's got you

877
00:55:45,460 --> 00:55:52,940
but yeah, Mark Hamill like to do it with like such a a list like superstar actor.

878
00:55:52,940 --> 00:55:57,260
Yeah, it just kind of made me feel like I don't know at least make us like at

879
00:55:57,280 --> 00:56:00,960
always put us in the movie and I think it's like three slave brothers or the

880
00:56:00,960 --> 00:56:01,920
waiters. The thing is

881
00:56:01,920 --> 00:56:07,600
waiters that we do honestly the thing that pisses me off. Yeah, okay, mark

882
00:56:07,600 --> 00:56:12,680
Hamill, obviously famous actor, very popular right now, huge get to talk. I

883
00:56:12,680 --> 00:56:15,880
think he's in terms of skill. He's more of a commercial actually does star wars.

884
00:56:15,880 --> 00:56:19,280
He does joker. He does this type of thing, you know, and I know for a fact

885
00:56:19,280 --> 00:56:23,040
that if we had been involved in the movie, yeah, I could have gotten Philip

886
00:56:23,080 --> 00:56:24,680
anymore Hoffman yeah and we

887
00:56:24,680 --> 00:56:30,680
I have footage of him that nobody else has ever seen of him doing a lot of the

888
00:56:30,680 --> 00:56:34,560
stuff from the machine. No way that I worked with him to produce, because I

889
00:56:34,560 --> 00:56:39,480
thought maybe it would be a funny gag to put into our three man's one man. So

890
00:56:39,480 --> 00:56:42,660
with current technology on the current technology, we could literally copy and

891
00:56:42,660 --> 00:56:47,040
paste him wow on the topic of Mark Hamill. I thought that he was just like

892
00:56:47,040 --> 00:56:51,320
a Twitter guy before he became an actor. I think he will yeah, because he

893
00:56:52,440 --> 00:56:57,880
he's one of those s h t i t my dad says type yeah yeah yeah he's like he like he

894
00:56:57,880 --> 00:57:01,840
kind of like blew up yeah like that yeah through to it. I actually think he he

895
00:57:01,840 --> 00:57:07,560
blew up off on Google buzz, Google buzz really yeah, oh my God, I forgot about

896
00:57:07,560 --> 00:57:12,640
Google buzz. I was so popular on there yeah on Google buzz yeah, what's Google?

897
00:57:12,640 --> 00:57:16,960
I never heard of this. That was Google's yeah, you it was only a book before

898
00:57:16,960 --> 00:57:21,640
Google plus what you never heard of Google buzz never I had five, but I was

899
00:57:21,680 --> 00:57:26,280
Google plus to the death. I loved Google buzz. I was on there like just got a

900
00:57:26,280 --> 00:57:30,600
sandwich y'all. Yeah, me too. I was a my space. He's like using it. I was going on

901
00:57:30,600 --> 00:57:35,960
there and saying like new metal is the shoes. I was a my space kid. I also had a

902
00:57:35,960 --> 00:57:41,320
my space. I was a my space kid. I'd set my I still remember my photo. I had my

903
00:57:41,320 --> 00:57:45,280
beanie barely hanging off my head and I was like looking this way. It was like

904
00:57:45,280 --> 00:57:50,160
Caleb and it said you could put your body type in and it was athletic. It's

905
00:57:50,200 --> 00:57:55,880
Ectomorphic. No, 5'3", more to love. Yeah. Because I was a little chunky. I had MySpace

906
00:57:55,880 --> 00:58:01,440
when I was 9 because my mom let me have it. Bad decision on her part. There was a lot

907
00:58:01,440 --> 00:58:06,720
of people trying to add me. I was 9 years old. Then I lied. 9? I lied and said that

908
00:58:06,720 --> 00:58:11,200
I was 13 in my bio. Yeah, I think 13 is the... My mom pulled me aside one day and was like,

909
00:58:11,200 --> 00:58:14,440
"You need to stop lying about your age on the internet." And I was like, "If I say that

910
00:58:14,440 --> 00:58:18,920
I'm 9 and on MySpace and my bio, Tom is going to kick me off." Yeah, Tom was 9. I used to

911
00:58:18,920 --> 00:58:23,300
to be I when I was when I was a kid and I was on like like going like looking at

912
00:58:23,300 --> 00:58:28,140
forums and stuff, I was so I would get so embarrassed that I was a kid. Oh yeah,

913
00:58:28,140 --> 00:58:29,880
yeah, I'm twenty five yeah yeah. I

914
00:58:29,880 --> 00:58:35,820
like I'm actually like I'm seventeen. I used to lie on runescape so much about

915
00:58:35,820 --> 00:58:39,680
my everything about me yeah. I told people Fortress, I told people I was on

916
00:58:39,680 --> 00:58:43,820
runescape. I told people I was Irish and I knew like Gaelic and I would like go

917
00:58:43,820 --> 00:58:48,660
to Google translate and translate stuff into like like Gaelic or Scots or

918
00:58:48,680 --> 00:58:52,600
whatever and then just send that and it just made no sense. I'd be like, "Whoa,

919
00:58:52,600 --> 00:58:57,440
this kid's Irish." Yeah. And then little do I know, I find out when I'm older.

920
00:58:57,440 --> 00:59:00,760
Yeah. I was Irish the entire time. So maybe I wasn't lying at all, but I don't

921
00:59:00,760 --> 00:59:06,000
think I know gay. Ancestral memory. When I had MySpace, I got in trouble because

922
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:14,080
my Uncle Jack was my friend and I had just seen that CKY tour documentary and

923
00:59:14,080 --> 00:59:16,680
there's a scene where they go to Littleton, New Hampshire. They're playing

924
00:59:16,680 --> 00:59:22,440
a show in Manchester or something and Chad Ginsburg is like, "I need to go and piss

925
00:59:22,440 --> 00:59:28,920
on G.G. Allen's grave and give him a bottle of Jack Daniels. I need to go do that."

926
00:59:28,920 --> 00:59:35,040
I was like, "Oh, so my favorite band right now is G.G. Allen." And then in my music section,

927
00:59:35,040 --> 00:59:41,840
I had CKY, Bloodhound Gang, G.G. Allen, and my uncle called my mom and was like, "You

928
00:59:41,840 --> 00:59:47,240
you need to start watching what your son puts on that computer because he is saying he likes

929
00:59:47,240 --> 00:59:53,440
Gigi Allen and then showed my mom a video of Gigi Allen, like the documentary. My mom

930
00:59:53,440 --> 00:59:57,200
was like, "Get that off of there! Get that off of there right now!"

931
00:59:57,200 --> 00:59:58,200
That's kind of like...

932
00:59:58,200 --> 01:00:02,840
She didn't even make me deactivate my account. She just said, "Get Gigi Allen out of your

933
01:00:02,840 --> 01:00:03,840
top band."

934
01:00:03,840 --> 01:00:08,760
That triple is really bad news. That's like future Vape Store employee.

935
01:00:08,760 --> 01:00:10,400
My favorite music was all...

936
01:00:10,400 --> 01:00:15,040
Zky Bloodhound Gang, Gigi Allen. Yeah, yeah, mine was all like alternative

937
01:00:15,040 --> 01:00:18,380
metal that I found, like that it was all like stuff that you would get

938
01:00:18,380 --> 01:00:23,540
recommended on like the iTunes store. If you I said PIS, you also said Gigi

939
01:00:23,540 --> 01:00:27,820
Allen, it was all stuff that you'd get recommended on the iTunes store. Like if

940
01:00:27,820 --> 01:00:30,880
you listen to five finger death punch, like it was like the stuff that like

941
01:00:30,880 --> 01:00:34,780
nobody had ever heard of yeah that I still don't I've never heard anybody

942
01:00:34,800 --> 01:00:39,960
skillet no see no yeah skillet is a real. These are not real bands. I was

943
01:00:39,960 --> 01:00:44,600
sick of pretending. I didn't only listen to rap my entire life until like two

944
01:00:44,600 --> 01:00:48,480
years ago. Yeah, yeah, I only listen to rap. I pretended to like rock music, but

945
01:00:48,480 --> 01:00:53,120
I didn't really like it. Yeah, I liked I like the Halo three soundtrack, and

946
01:00:53,120 --> 01:00:59,720
then I like only rap my I used to like on the iTunes thing in like two thousand

947
01:00:59,760 --> 01:01:06,060
2008, I found out that the celebrities would have iTunes playlists. So I would

948
01:01:06,060 --> 01:01:08,860
look through and I thought that was the coolest thing in the world, and then it

949
01:01:08,860 --> 01:01:13,060
was like, "See what Dane Cook is listening to?" And then they would write

950
01:01:13,060 --> 01:01:16,500
like the playlist. They would have like this many songs. It was like, I think

951
01:01:16,500 --> 01:01:20,920
Dane Cook. I remember Dane Cook had "What's Her Name" by Green Day, and like

952
01:01:20,920 --> 01:01:25,860
the description he wrote is like, "Such a beautiful song." I'm just saying I'm

953
01:01:25,860 --> 01:01:29,440
getting nostalgic right now, because I'm thinking about when you go on the iTunes

954
01:01:29,460 --> 01:01:33,160
and you didn't know how to like list like you could you'd listen to the snippets

955
01:01:33,160 --> 01:01:37,020
the like 20 second snippet of a song and I didn't know I didn't know how to like

956
01:01:37,020 --> 01:01:40,680
find it on before I knew how to like find it on YouTube or just get it off

957
01:01:40,680 --> 01:01:43,740
like media fire or something and just be like I need to hear the rest of this

958
01:01:43,740 --> 01:01:47,460
song just be listening to the snippet over and over. Yeah, the snake I need to

959
01:01:47,460 --> 01:01:52,420
spend $10. Did you go to that with the bloodhound gang skits that were that the

960
01:01:52,420 --> 01:01:59,300
like just met the cut off? Yeah, so I'd show my brother like like what's that

961
01:01:59,300 --> 01:02:02,660
There's like a Bloodhound Gang skit where it's like they ask a,

962
01:02:02,660 --> 01:02:06,980
they are doing a homeless guy and it's like advice from him and it plays all this way.

963
01:02:06,980 --> 01:02:07,780
They're doing a homeless guy?

964
01:02:07,780 --> 01:02:14,180
No, they're doing a homeless guy voice and it just says try throwing your socks in the trash before you get the holes in the feet.

965
01:02:14,180 --> 01:02:15,780
Yeah, wait, okay, what is a homeless guy?

966
01:02:15,780 --> 01:02:22,580
The voice on the album is "try throwing your socks in the trash before you get the holes in the feet"

967
01:02:22,580 --> 01:02:25,940
and I showed that to my brother and it was the funniest thing in the world.

968
01:02:25,940 --> 01:02:28,940
Do you guys remember Barnes and Noble used to sell CDs?

969
01:02:28,940 --> 01:02:31,940
Yeah, you could sit there and listen to the CDs.

970
01:02:31,940 --> 01:02:33,940
Yeah, but they don't have the listening part anymore.

971
01:02:33,940 --> 01:02:36,940
