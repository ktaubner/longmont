1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,080
come back and make a mess

2
00:00:01,080 --> 00:00:08,080
and we see a black

3
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:13,480
the

4
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:16,760
that was a horrible start yet it is like a room in the episode

5
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:18,880
it was a little while now

6
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:22,560
that was like a fucking terror you are going to commutes is dropping dead

7
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:25,840
not bad i hope their ears you hope you kill people

8
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:31,760
yeah no you don't that's demented yeah whoa you really had that in your pocket

9
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:36,320
for this i did have this in my pocket the fake gun that we've that we've all seen

10
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:42,880
i should get a new fake gun that you pulled out one that looked a little bit different i would

11
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:47,280
have been a little worried yeah yeah if it had like some silver on it there is i mean it's like

12
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:51,920
the paint's chipping because we use it so much that gun is a really good like tell for when like

13
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:55,280
a new person comes over to the apartment to see if they're like weird or not

14
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:58,320
because if they like pick it up and like instantly start playing with it it's

15
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:03,920
like oh yeah you're maybe kind of weird. I feel like it's the opposite.

16
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:09,040
I feel like it's completely normal. Yeah no I feel like it's that's a yeah if this is a boy girl

17
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:14,080
test. If someone picks it up they're a boy. If they're scared of it they're a

18
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:20,320
girl. This apartment is kind of a boy's paradise. It truly is. A boy's fantasy land.

19
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:27,720
We have my roommate you guys live in the apartment from a shitty version of the apartment from big. Yeah. Yeah

20
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:30,440
Yeah

21
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:33,440
Just stop the play with everywhere

22
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:36,120
You really need to say that but thank you, bro

23
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:41,040
Appreciate it man. Yeah, you get bunk beds. That would be so sweet

24
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:45,760
I got hope there any sleep in one triple bunk bed and the other rooms are just play with that in the new apartment

25
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:48,840
Yeah, the new ceiling the new apartment located at

26
00:01:48,840 --> 00:02:06,880
that. You can cut that out. Great. No. Delete. Delete the file. Did you guys ever, was it

27
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:11,280
always going to be like this in here? Or at any point were you guys like, we're going

28
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:14,280
to have a real apartment and then it just kind of happened? It just kind of happened

29
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:17,640
like this. Oh really? I think at the new place we're probably gonna try.

30
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:22,040
Oh really? No. No it's gonna be like this but just like bigger. I kind of like it.

31
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:26,360
I think it's cool. The other day I was like standing by the fridge and I was

32
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:32,660
looking around like wow this looks awesome. You had that thought? Yeah.

33
00:02:32,660 --> 00:02:42,360
You were so proud of the fridge. I was standing by the fridge and I like stood back and did

34
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:46,280
like the you know like the point five yeah of the whole apartment.

35
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:48,520
I don't even think this place is nice.

36
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:49,720
I always think this is...

37
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:55,800
Every like two square feet of this apartment is like a different kind of hoarder's apartment.

38
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:56,800
Yeah.

39
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:58,800
Like there's like the food hoarder is over there.

40
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:03,400
Well this is to me the most egregious thing which is that next to all of your food you

41
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:04,400
have your shoes.

42
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:05,400
Oh yeah.

43
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:11,160
Yeah, it's like basically one shelf that is like cereal into like shoes that you wear

44
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:19,560
And then it's also cleaning supplies. We should just pay like one woman $50 to come in and fix this you think is a

45
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:29,400
This is a job this is a contract amazing because it's such a small space but it really is just like

46
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:35,320
Crazy it's fine. You're excited when you do bursting with life for like what you're not excited to move

47
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:37,320
You guys are gonna find so are you guys getting a truck?

48
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:42,000
We're gonna rent a you we're all gonna go in on a u-haul. I think with yeah, Joe

49
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:47,480
I'm scared of any of you driving a u-haul. I don't know how to drive. I think Joe's gonna drive

50
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:52,240
He likes driving so hold the mic closer to you. Yeah, yeah

51
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:58,400
Yeah, yeah kiss the mic and call it Caleb mm-hmm

52
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:03,400
Stop looking at me. I'm uncomfortable.

53
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:09,400
Oh yeah, because we have Alex on because he's going to be at the live show on March 31st.

54
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:11,400
I don't think that's why he's on.

55
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:12,400
That's why he's on?

56
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:14,400
I think he's on because he's in the apartment.

57
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:16,400
Because I was just standing here.

58
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:17,400
Yeah.

59
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:24,400
Because the other option was he was going to cook a pizza while we did the episode.

60
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:27,400
Wait, speaking of which, I'm gonna go see if the oven is ready.

61
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:31,900
It's not. It's gonna beep if it's ready. You know that it does that.

62
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:36,100
You guys have an automatic beeper? The oven beeps. Oh, I need a beeper, bad.

63
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:39,600
You don't have a beeper pre-heaper? I don't have a pre-heaper beeper, no.

64
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:43,900
No, you have like an old-ass oven. My oven, I just got replaced and it still sucks ass.

65
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:47,400
Yeah, dude, are you kidding? Your place had gas in it.

66
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:50,400
Yeah, it did. They're not gonna put like a...

67
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:55,520
like and they're gonna put like a fancy all my all my neighbors have also had

68
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:59,600
gas leaks. It's kind of a chronic that's in my apartment old old ovens like the

69
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:03,400
one that in your apartment. They always freak me out like that to me like I look

70
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:06,000
at it. That's just like a Mad Max contraption like the one where you have

71
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,520
to read like the pilot light with the like his oven at like holes in it all

72
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:14,400
over it true. That's it. That's it. That's it. That's it. That's it. That's

73
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:17,400
it. That's it. That's it. That's it. That's it. That's it. That's it. That's

74
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:21,480
like steampunk thing like I don't I don't trust those it look like it ran on no

75
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:25,320
like I fucked up like old oven do you know you know exactly yeah yeah like one

76
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:32,460
on disenchantment season three on Netflix one time I got up to season three on

77
00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:37,880
yeah I'm on the podcast to support is to plug disenchantment I worked on that

78
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:44,000
show really would you do story like script supervisor I voiced on max

79
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:50,800
I don't do the voice of Max that the audience knows. Max is the uh he's on disenchantment.

80
00:05:50,800 --> 00:06:00,000
Do the voice. I don't want to give any spoilers. Okay then say something say I'm making a pizza

81
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:08,640
in his voice. I'm making a pizza oh Matt and Max is a lot of like uh whoa. He does

82
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:11,040
he says

83
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:16,640
from the episode. Why do you think that he edits any of this?

84
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:22,160
There's no editing in this. He's sitting the closest to the equipment. That is true.

85
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:26,080
Yeah. I mean, the only one with headphones on. I export it, but I don't, I don't,

86
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:28,800
I don't edit it. I don't listen to it or anything.

87
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:32,800
Look at him just having like a horrible time realizing that.

88
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:38,960
Really? Everybody's going to think I'm mad. You've been on the show before.

89
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:43,440
You were on like a month ago, but I thought you guys like cut around stuff.

90
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:43,940
No.

91
00:06:43,940 --> 00:06:45,220
Okay.

92
00:06:45,220 --> 00:06:52,960
How was the, I hear Malibu's Most Wanted was a great rewatch.

93
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:57,120
Unbelievable. I've never seen it before. Have you seen Malibu's Most Wanted?

94
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:57,840
It's so good.

95
00:06:57,840 --> 00:06:58,720
Have you seen Malibu's?

96
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:00,640
You seen the boo?

97
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:02,000
You seen the boo?

98
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,440
No, what's it about?

99
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:07,680
It's about a vanilla gorilla who's just fucking out there in Malibu doing his thing.

100
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:14,800
White Kong. It's Jamie Kennedy and he thinks he's a black guy and his dad is a rich...

101
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:19,760
He's running for governor and he's gonna tarnish his dad's image.

102
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:20,480
And so...

103
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:22,080
Exactly the plot of Black Sheep.

104
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:23,280
Yeah.

105
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:25,360
So they should have just called it Blacker Sheep.

106
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:25,600
Yeah.

107
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:33,040
It's good. And then he hires... Taye Diggs and Anthony Anderson are actors and he hires

108
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:37,120
them to pretend to be gangsters like kidnap Jamie Kennedy and like take him to

109
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:41,400
the hood and scare the black out of him yeah and it's great it's really funny

110
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:45,960
really good they get mixed up with some actual way with some real fuck tech

111
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:56,720
actually yeah Snoop Dogg voices a mouse yeah plays a rizz at it's it's that like

112
00:07:56,720 --> 00:08:02,920
it's that perfect like like era of American comedy where every single movie

113
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:08,840
had to have an animal that spoke English. Yeah. Where it didn't matter what movie it was.

114
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:14,040
We were saying that afterwards where it's like just like early 2000s like comedies,

115
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:18,360
like studio comedies, just like big broad comedies like that are just always great.

116
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:23,240
Like I don't like they're like that holds up way better than any fucking comedy that came out in

117
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:29,320
2018. That shit's better than Juno. Yeah. By a lot. And I and we don't say that lightly. Yeah.

118
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:33,400
And I'm the biggest Juno fan in the world. I love Juno.

119
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:34,920
Juno's some funny fucking shit.

120
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:35,640
You like Juno? Try living it, bro.

121
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:37,160
Try some funny ass bullshit.

122
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:37,640
Yeah.

123
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:37,880
Really?

124
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:38,680
Try living it.

125
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:42,040
I can see you Michael Cera-ing a teenager.

126
00:08:42,040 --> 00:08:42,280
Yeah.

127
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:43,640
Thanks.

128
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:47,880
He's doing it right now.

129
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:48,440
Yeah.

130
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:49,160
What'd you say, Pat?

131
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:50,680
His girlfriend is 15.

132
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:52,120
Oh yeah, I heard that.

133
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:52,360
Yeah.

134
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:54,760
No.

135
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:58,440
What, Pat?

136
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:02,120
What did I say? I don't remember. You seemed like you were going to ask me an important question.

137
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:06,200
I don't remember. Okay. Did you guys see the prequel to Juno, Mayo?

138
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:11,320
Mayo? Get it? Like May and June, but it also sounds like mayo, like the food.

139
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:16,600
Good. Pretty good, right? Yeah, and did you see the one for that? April-O?

140
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:18,520
No. Don't even get me.

141
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:22,360
Yeah, but you got to watch March-O to get April-O. Yeah.

142
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:24,280
And February-O.

143
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:30,280
and January. Oh, it's like a Greek guy's name. Yeah. February. Oh,

144
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:31,240
maybe we'll add a little bit.

145
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:33,480
I am February. Okay. Geeklobblist.

146
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:39,720
And I am going, I am going to sell you a prequel.

147
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:42,360
Did you guys see the prequel to January? Oh, December. Oh, the year before. Oh,

148
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:48,200
it's different from December. Oh, which is the 12th movie.

149
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:52,760
That one has Santa in it. Yeah.

150
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:56,760
Santa delivers a baby. Santa's pregnant. That's why he's so fat.

151
00:09:56,760 --> 00:10:02,360
The whole movie is a teenager slowly sees like a stork way off in the distance and it gets closer

152
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:09,000
and closer. Yeah, and Jason Bateman's the father. Yeah. Is he the dad in that movie? No, he's the,

153
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:13,320
he wants to adopt him. Yeah. Jennifer Garner want to adopt. Michael Cera's the baby daddy.

154
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:17,560
And then Jason Bateman is. They should have called that movie Baby Daddy instead. They

155
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:20,680
should have. Jason Bateman is the one. Isn't that already a movie? Jason Bateman's,

156
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:22,520
He's finna adopt a baby.

157
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:25,720
But then he like falls in love with Elliot Page and like...

158
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:29,800
'Cause he like whispers that's in the scene.

159
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:30,840
I've never seen Dune-O.

160
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:31,080
Really?

161
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:31,960
That's good.

162
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:33,480
There's music playing in it.

163
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:33,720
Yeah.

164
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:36,040
I do remember they had that...

165
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:37,080
One of the great mysteries of cinema.

166
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:39,720
They had that guitar scene and everyone loved the soundtrack.

167
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:42,440
Oh yeah, the soundtrack was that like folky...

168
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:44,760
Fuck those soundtrack movies.

169
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:45,720
What was that other one?

170
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:47,320
Nick and Nora's Infinite Playlist?

171
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:48,360
Both Michael Cera movies.

172
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:49,880
Dumbest fucking movie in the world, dude.

173
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:52,200
Both Michael Cera movies.

174
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:54,280
I think it's his fault.

175
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:55,280
It probably is his fault.

176
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:56,960
Trying to make him- He's a musical guy.

177
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:58,680
Trying to make him some damn indie.

178
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:01,920
Yeah, he plays the bass.

179
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:02,920
And Scott Pilgrim.

180
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:03,920
Fuck him.

181
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:04,920
I'm going to fillet him like a salmon.

182
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:05,920
No, he plays the bass in real life.

183
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:06,920
He was really good in 8 Mile though.

184
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:07,920
He was great.

185
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:14,240
That's a good soundtrack movie.

186
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:15,240
I guess that one is a good soundtrack movie.

187
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:16,240
8 Mile is so good, dude.

188
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:17,240
It's one of my dad's favorite movies.

189
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:18,240
I watch it really often.

190
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:19,240
I watch movies.

191
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:20,240
Really?

192
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:21,240
Yeah.

193
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:22,240
I watch it every other year.

194
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:23,240
I've never seen that.

195
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:24,240
Every other year?

196
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:26,080
Yeah, I watch it every other year.

197
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:27,080
My dad, you can do keep track.

198
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:29,880
I watch, I watch, I watch, well yeah, one year I watch 8 Mile, the other year I watch

199
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:31,920
Remember the Titans, and I just do that.

200
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:34,320
That's a good movie.

201
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:35,320
Every other year, dude.

202
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:36,320
Remember the Titans?

203
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:40,480
Yeah, I remember, I had to watch, in high school I took like a, it was like a movie class.

204
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:43,960
It was like a class that seniors could take where you're supposed to like write like reviews

205
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:44,960
for movies basically.

206
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:45,960
Yeah.

207
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:51,240
by like the lacrosse coach who only his only other job at the school was this

208
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:56,360
like class he's like an English teacher so he could just coach lacrosse and like

209
00:11:56,360 --> 00:12:00,560
fish for the rest of his life yeah so sick Russ his name was rusty brand I

210
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:06,920
remember I had this I had this I had this like I played peewee football we

211
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:12,200
had this like older like black dude who was our like head coach and I remember

212
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:15,720
one time like I played for like three seasons and after our first season we

213
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:17,360
we would always, at the end of the season,

214
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:19,280
we would always have a fun movie night thing

215
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:20,640
to cap off the season.

216
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:22,040
We did Remember the Titans,

217
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:25,520
and he acted completely differently after watching that movie.

218
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:26,760
(laughing)

219
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:29,640
He had never seen it before,

220
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:30,560
and he used to just be like,

221
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:31,880
"Okay, we're gonna run these reels,"

222
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:32,720
and then he would come in

223
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:35,040
at the beginning of the next season like,

224
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:38,080
"Listen, boys, it's about courage.

225
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:40,160
"It's about honor.

226
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:42,280
"It's about respecting each other."

227
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:44,560
And then we lost, and we never won a game

228
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:50,000
entire time I played peewee football. I'd love to touch down your peewee. I'd like to see

229
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:54,480
your peewee. You don't want to see my peewee. I want to see your peewee. I want to see your

230
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:58,560
peewee in your footballs. I have seen Caleb's penis. Today is one of those days where you

231
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:03,320
wake up. Today is one of those days where you wake up and I looked at my penis when

232
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:07,920
I woke up and I said that's a baby's penis. That is the smallest penis I've ever seen.

233
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:11,480
I don't have that problem. You never wake up and look at your penis and say that's a

234
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:14,040
- You know when I wake up, it's like midday,

235
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:17,220
when I'm like, I stop into a Starbucks

236
00:13:17,220 --> 00:13:18,880
'cause it's like cold out and I need to pee,

237
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:20,520
and then I go into the Starbucks bathroom

238
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:21,720
and I like look down and I'm like,

239
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:23,920
damn, I am not packing at all.

240
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:24,760
- I slept with the windows open.

241
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:25,600
- I'm packing nothing.

242
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:27,520
It's like a Q-tip down there.

243
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:29,920
- Yeah, I looked at my shit and it was pretty much all.

244
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:32,280
- Ever heard of a little thing called morning wood?

245
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:34,540
(laughing)

246
00:13:34,540 --> 00:13:38,520
- That is my morning wood.

247
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:39,560
- That stinks then.

248
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:43,440
yeah you keep your morning ball of morning zing balsa wood yeah in the

249
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:46,880
summer dude I wake up with it I wake up with a heater that's as good as my penis

250
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:51,640
gets yeah is when I wake up and I fucking for me the biggest ever guess is after I

251
00:13:51,640 --> 00:14:02,480
use my penis pump what so is it there's a penis pump growing is it growing your

252
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:10,560
penis I think it just pumps it it doesn't it doesn't give it like a bicycle group I

253
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:15,800
get yeah some some guy sold it to me that's not a target and you just put the

254
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:19,360
needle in the top yeah he said the label says it's a bike pump but don't worry

255
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:23,960
it's a penis pump and you have to use it in the bath I I think I would enjoy

256
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:28,680
using a penis pump yeah yeah I feel like what do you have like a thin penis no just

257
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:31,880
You look like one of those guys with a very thin penis.

258
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:33,880
What's that from?

259
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:35,880
I don't know.

260
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:37,880
That's from something.

261
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:39,880
I did not steal that.

262
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:41,880
Swear to God, you stole that.

263
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:43,880
I did not steal that.

264
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:45,880
You stole that from Nick Swartzen on the Norm MacDonald show.

265
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:47,880
No.

266
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:49,880
Nick Swartzen, one of the co-writers of Malibu's Most Wanted.

267
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:51,880
Nick Swartzen really, really good.

268
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:53,880
Yeah.

269
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:55,880
No, because that, I know what you're talking about.

270
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:57,880
It's Danny's.

271
00:14:57,880 --> 00:15:02,440
No, no, no, no, no. Because that's a completely different joke. Fuck you.

272
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:02,940
No.

273
00:15:02,940 --> 00:15:07,880
Yeah, because the joke is Danny DeVito looks like one of those guys with a short but fat penis.

274
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:12,280
And all I said was you look like one of those guys with a thin penis. That is not the same at all.

275
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:13,240
That's called a remix.

276
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:13,960
Exactly the same joke.

277
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:15,880
That is not the same at all. Fuck you.

278
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:16,520
You're a biter.

279
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:18,680
That's exactly the same joke.

280
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:20,840
No, that's not. Fuck both of you.

281
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:21,960
It's the same joke.

282
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:23,560
It's not the same joke.

283
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:28,360
My penis is like, it's pretty big. It's like probably like two pencils wide.

284
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:38,360
Two carpenter pencils, like the ones that are like really thin and flat.

285
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:40,360
Number two, Tychondorogas.

286
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:44,120
It's exactly the same shape as two of the carpenter pencils like side by side.

287
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:48,360
So it's like, it's a perfect box. It's like a, yeah, it looks like a shoe box for like,

288
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:54,680
like for a barbie agonal my my dad my penis is two pencils wide two colored

289
00:15:54,680 --> 00:16:14,600
pencils my penis is two pencils like mechanical pencils more like two crayons

290
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:21,720
But my balls on the other hand. No, my balls are bigger than my penis.

291
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:27,960
Would you rather have, okay. Okay, all right. All right, here we go. Settle in. Okay, really long,

292
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:34,480
really like, like, nine. I got long balls playing. No, no, nine inch penis, right? No. Nine inch

293
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:37,640
penis, but it's like. That's too big. That sounds like a hash. Girls actually don't like that.

294
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:42,720
I heard. Girls hate that. Yeah. Nine inch penis, but it's like probably like as thin as this.

295
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:48,040
this this which you have to describe it out loud this part oh it's a it's a the

296
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:52,960
Spitfire they have every half inch or three-quarters of an inch in diameter

297
00:16:52,960 --> 00:17:00,480
yeah yeah yeah it's but the or or like a we're like a reasonable chode what would

298
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:03,720
you consider to be a reasonable chair I think you need to put some measure okay

299
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:08,760
so like like five inches five and a half long five and a half long but like

300
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:13,100
pretty girthy. Oh definitely that one. But I mean I'm talking like... Five and a half

301
00:17:13,100 --> 00:17:16,700
isn't it? That's not that bad. Like it's shaped like it's probably shaped like this this

302
00:17:16,700 --> 00:17:24,300
HAL seltzer bottle. Oh that one 100% yeah. Yeah. A small like a biggest penis I've ever seen.

303
00:17:24,300 --> 00:17:30,900
Five and a half. Yeah. Or an even bigger penis but like pencil thin. Definitely not the pencil thin one.

304
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:34,980
You don't want to have a pencil thin penis. You can just like break. Yeah that I would be worried that I would

305
00:17:34,980 --> 00:17:38,280
would damage my also I would just be walking around and it would break in my

306
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:42,140
pants. Think about the inside of a woman's vagina. It's a triangle.

307
00:17:42,140 --> 00:17:45,540
Okay, it's a trial.

308
00:17:45,540 --> 00:17:51,300
It's a bunch of hexagons. Yeah, overlaid on the inside look like

309
00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:57,140
I don't want to think about it. I think it's like it's like a paper lunch bag

310
00:17:57,140 --> 00:18:02,380
and never done. Hold on. I'll wait hold your make to make two Spocks with your

311
00:18:02,380 --> 00:18:03,020
hands right.

312
00:18:03,020 --> 00:18:13,220
mm-hmm and now put them sideways and put them on the mind now look in yeah that's

313
00:18:13,220 --> 00:18:22,540
what the inside of a vagina looks like it looks like the entire world I think it

314
00:18:22,540 --> 00:18:28,860
looks kind of like the insert inside of a sweatshirt sleeve it feels like it - I

315
00:18:28,860 --> 00:18:33,640
I do think that yeah the cavernous part of a vagina has got to be it's like the

316
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:36,560
Would you rather have a very deep vagina or a penis?

317
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:37,760
Okay this is a better...

318
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:39,260
Very deep vagina or penis?

319
00:18:39,260 --> 00:18:40,560
Deep vagina.

320
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:41,060
Yeah?

321
00:18:41,060 --> 00:18:42,660
Cuz I'd be a girl.

322
00:18:42,660 --> 00:18:43,560
That would be cool.

323
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:44,060
Yeah.

324
00:18:44,060 --> 00:18:45,760
Next question.

325
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:46,760
[laughter]

326
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:48,760
You'd fit like a spray paint can in there.

327
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:50,360
I'd be doing all kinds of pranks.

328
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:54,060
Like if I... can you guys imagine if I was the like girl of our group?

329
00:18:54,060 --> 00:18:55,460
That would be so fucked up.

330
00:18:55,460 --> 00:18:59,060
Dude, I would be like, pooping shit out of my vagina on your floor all the time.

331
00:18:59,060 --> 00:19:00,180
I would ask you out on a date.

332
00:19:00,180 --> 00:19:02,820
I would let you guys play.

333
00:19:02,820 --> 00:19:06,340
I would let you guys, I'd let you guys finger me.

334
00:19:06,340 --> 00:19:07,340
Just whenever you want.

335
00:19:07,340 --> 00:19:08,340
Yeah.

336
00:19:08,340 --> 00:19:09,340
Okay.

337
00:19:09,340 --> 00:19:10,340
That'd be cool.

338
00:19:10,340 --> 00:19:11,340
Yep.

339
00:19:11,340 --> 00:19:12,340
I'd install myself in the wall.

340
00:19:12,340 --> 00:19:13,340
I would.

341
00:19:13,340 --> 00:19:21,500
I'd be, I would be at my head hitting the studs inside this wall.

342
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:23,100
And you guys could fuck my butt in my thing.

343
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:24,100
Damn.

344
00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:25,100
You can just do that now.

345
00:19:25,100 --> 00:19:27,520
- I need that for real.

346
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:29,020
- I'm married.

347
00:19:29,020 --> 00:19:30,900
- He doesn't even have the ring on.

348
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:31,740
- Oh my God.

349
00:19:31,740 --> 00:19:32,780
- Wait, no I'm not.

350
00:19:32,780 --> 00:19:34,780
- How big is the ring you're gonna get?

351
00:19:34,780 --> 00:19:36,200
- I'm getting a pendant ring.

352
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:37,040
- Oh, what's that?

353
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:37,860
- It's gonna be gold.

354
00:19:37,860 --> 00:19:38,700
- Whoa.

355
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:39,540
- That's actually sick.

356
00:19:39,540 --> 00:19:40,940
- Pure gold.

357
00:19:40,940 --> 00:19:42,760
- You should get, you know what would be sick

358
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:45,420
if you got like a Super Bowl championship style ring?

359
00:19:45,420 --> 00:19:46,260
(laughing)

360
00:19:46,260 --> 00:19:49,540
Like it just says like embroidered Stewie's head.

361
00:19:49,540 --> 00:19:50,380
- Yeah.

362
00:19:50,380 --> 00:19:52,460
- But like big Super Bowl ring.

363
00:19:52,460 --> 00:19:54,340
- Get Johnny Dang to do it.

364
00:19:54,340 --> 00:19:55,540
That'd be sick, dude.

365
00:19:55,540 --> 00:19:56,380
That would be tight.

366
00:19:56,380 --> 00:19:58,880
That's your wedding ring, just like a giant fucking...

367
00:19:58,880 --> 00:19:59,720
Yeah.

368
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:01,220
That'd be tight.

369
00:20:01,220 --> 00:20:03,020
Well, now it's my idea and you can't take it.

370
00:20:03,020 --> 00:20:03,840
That's fine.

371
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:04,680
This motherfucker.

372
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:05,940
This motherfucker was stupid as hell,

373
00:20:05,940 --> 00:20:08,220
didn't get a big ass ring.

374
00:20:08,220 --> 00:20:09,780
Do you pick out your ring if you're the husband,

375
00:20:09,780 --> 00:20:11,060
or does the girl pick it out for you?

376
00:20:11,060 --> 00:20:12,740
I don't think the ring matters at all.

377
00:20:12,740 --> 00:20:14,380
The ring matters.

378
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:15,200
No.

379
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:16,580
The ring matters, for sure.

380
00:20:16,580 --> 00:20:18,580
You're a materialistic.

381
00:20:18,580 --> 00:20:20,020
You should get married to a guy then.

382
00:20:20,020 --> 00:20:22,140
You don't know the true meaning of marriage.

383
00:20:22,140 --> 00:20:22,980
I don't.

384
00:20:22,980 --> 00:20:23,820
Yeah.

385
00:20:23,820 --> 00:20:27,820
Well you're not doing a very good job of learning. It's about saving money on your taxes.

386
00:20:27,820 --> 00:20:33,500
Yep. Yeah. That's basically the only... Oh now he's interested. It's about enslaving a woman for 50

387
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:38,220
years. That's right. Signing a contract. It's about endless toil. And making sure you get a prenup.

388
00:20:38,220 --> 00:20:46,620
Not for you. It's about sharing a damn credit card. Oh yeah. Whoa. Whoa. Dennis. Mm-hmm. What up? Yep.

389
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:54,860
What up Dennis? Yep, my credit card is used more than the the fingering box at Caleb Pitts' house.

390
00:20:54,860 --> 00:21:01,980
The fingering box? You really botched that like really hard. That was rough.

391
00:21:01,980 --> 00:21:04,420
The fingering box.

392
00:21:04,420 --> 00:21:06,420
That was like teed up.

393
00:21:06,420 --> 00:21:08,420
My credit card is used more than the fingering box.

394
00:21:08,420 --> 00:21:14,420
Pat just ran up to the tee ball and like threw the bat at the umpire by accident.

395
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:19,780
Did you ever play little league? Yeah, no inside the park home run for the

396
00:21:19,780 --> 00:21:25,420
Reading the Marlins in third grade. Whoa, dude, that's the

397
00:21:25,420 --> 00:21:32,300
They did not get any hits on the when I was on the Jett trass team sports blue jays

398
00:21:32,300 --> 00:21:36,060
Nice and the laugh of tea in the laugh of farm league. We did not get any hits

399
00:21:36,060 --> 00:21:41,340
I was scared of baseball when I was a kid that thing comes fast at you when I went to like a

400
00:21:42,740 --> 00:21:44,900
AAA, AA, a minor league game.

401
00:21:44,900 --> 00:21:45,140
Yeah, AA.

402
00:21:45,140 --> 00:21:48,500
There was one right by my house and we went and I was like probably five years old.

403
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:50,740
We got really good seats. We were like really close.

404
00:21:50,740 --> 00:21:55,780
And there was a girl like my age like sitting in front of me and there was like,

405
00:21:55,780 --> 00:22:00,500
I'd never been to a baseball game before and there was like a foul ball and it like went up

406
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:03,700
and the girl was sitting right in front of me and I just will never forget the sound,

407
00:22:03,700 --> 00:22:07,380
but it just was like, "Oh!" like right on the head, bro.

408
00:22:07,380 --> 00:22:09,060
And she just started like screaming.

409
00:22:09,060 --> 00:22:16,900
There's all these videos of like guys who are like really young like 19 year old

410
00:22:16,900 --> 00:22:21,220
dudes like right in the NBA or the MLB who are just like NBA National Baseball

411
00:22:21,220 --> 00:22:24,500
Association that it should be called that you're just hitting dingers and

412
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:28,700
there's there's like a compilation of these guys hitting home runs and being

413
00:22:28,700 --> 00:22:32,620
like yeah home run cuz you don't get that many home runs in a season and then

414
00:22:32,620 --> 00:22:37,820
the ball hits like an infant kid and just like immediately kills them and

415
00:22:37,820 --> 00:22:40,060
And they're just like, "Oh, fuck."

416
00:22:40,060 --> 00:22:42,060
And then they just continue playing the game.

417
00:22:42,060 --> 00:22:43,260
What are you gonna do? Stop?

418
00:22:43,260 --> 00:22:44,780
The show must go on.

419
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:45,580
Hospital.

420
00:22:45,580 --> 00:22:48,460
Like some of these people get like permanent brain damage.

421
00:22:48,460 --> 00:22:49,580
They're never the same.

422
00:22:49,580 --> 00:22:51,260
Yeah, there was a player, John Oldrood.

423
00:22:51,260 --> 00:22:54,540
He had to wear a helmet all the time when he played.

424
00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:56,460
A player?

425
00:22:56,460 --> 00:22:57,020
Yeah.

426
00:22:57,020 --> 00:22:58,380
I'm talking about people in the stands.

427
00:22:58,380 --> 00:22:59,500
Well, no, it's the same deal.

428
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:01,420
He got like hit in the head with a ball or some shit.

429
00:23:01,420 --> 00:23:02,300
But he's still doing okay.

430
00:23:02,300 --> 00:23:04,060
He can still play baseball.

431
00:23:04,060 --> 00:23:04,700
No.

432
00:23:04,700 --> 00:23:07,260
Well, why'd you say he had to wear a helmet?

433
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:10,460
everybody wears a helmet when you play baseball.

434
00:23:10,460 --> 00:23:13,980
Yep, no, but not all the time. You wear baseball caps.

435
00:23:13,980 --> 00:23:17,340
Yeah, like the batter, well, like even when he's on the field, like they just

436
00:23:17,340 --> 00:23:20,140
wear the hats. He'd wear a helmet on the field so he

437
00:23:20,140 --> 00:23:22,860
could still play, like if he was playing like first base or shit. Is it because

438
00:23:22,860 --> 00:23:25,980
he just like, he just got hit all the time, like he just,

439
00:23:25,980 --> 00:23:29,340
the ball was just drawn to him? The ball was magnetized to his head.

440
00:23:29,340 --> 00:23:32,860
That's bad. He had a cork magnet in his head.

441
00:23:32,860 --> 00:23:36,780
Yeah. And it just... There was somebody in the stands casting a spell on him.

442
00:23:36,780 --> 00:23:41,900
yeah that's all rude head that would be a great that would be a great uh jackass

443
00:23:41,900 --> 00:23:45,660
prank for the future they could have a remote control baseball that like flies

444
00:23:45,660 --> 00:23:49,100
around and hits a little star wars ball a good jackass prank in the future would

445
00:23:49,100 --> 00:23:52,700
be they have to fight a robot

446
00:23:52,700 --> 00:23:56,700
i will i'm excited to see future jackass yeah they can probably come up with some

447
00:23:56,700 --> 00:23:59,980
really good shit yeah flying machine trapping somebody in

448
00:23:59,980 --> 00:24:04,140
virtual reality forever yeah yeah i want to do that so bad i want to trap

449
00:24:04,140 --> 00:24:07,740
someone a virtual reality for the entire life. Once we get like a matrix kind of

450
00:24:07,740 --> 00:24:10,660
plug in the back they're just gonna start killing each other it's gonna be

451
00:24:10,660 --> 00:24:14,460
awesome. If I ever figure out how to how to found a micronation I'm

452
00:24:14,460 --> 00:24:20,140
absolutely raising a child in VR where the police can't send me to jail.

453
00:24:20,140 --> 00:24:26,700
Convincing them that like the headset is part of their head. Yeah that's your brother Sonic.

454
00:24:28,180 --> 00:24:33,500
you can run with him Gary's mom do you think that you're gonna have the best

455
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:45,820
time I also that that my I also really want I would love to have a huge compound

456
00:24:45,820 --> 00:24:51,340
to do that to like a hundred chimpanzees hmm oh you know the house now yeah I saw

457
00:24:51,340 --> 00:24:55,500
that like they stole my house in VR basically just show them like the

458
00:24:55,500 --> 00:25:00,060
default windows background and the cows get really we're like way happier and

459
00:25:00,060 --> 00:25:04,760
they produce more spunk and milk yeah yeah that's good for animals it's good

460
00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:09,060
that we do that to him I think yeah I mean it is terrifying that we're just

461
00:25:09,060 --> 00:25:12,940
like putting cows in virtual reality no it's this it's this scariest shit ever

462
00:25:12,940 --> 00:25:18,820
cuz maybe we're the cows shit no couldn't be maybe we're in virtual reality

463
00:25:18,820 --> 00:25:24,540
yeah it doesn't make any fucking sense yeah oh cows are putting in virtual

464
00:25:24,540 --> 00:25:29,660
reality cows are putting flies in so that they can eat them better.

465
00:25:29,660 --> 00:25:30,660
Yeah.

466
00:25:30,660 --> 00:25:31,660
Yeah.

467
00:25:31,660 --> 00:25:35,820
Do you guys ever do that thing where you look at a thing, it's like...

468
00:25:35,820 --> 00:25:36,820
Yes.

469
00:25:36,820 --> 00:25:42,700
You show someone like something that's white, like I'm picking up a white face mask.

470
00:25:42,700 --> 00:25:43,700
Okay.

471
00:25:43,700 --> 00:25:44,700
Cameron, what color is this?

472
00:25:44,700 --> 00:25:45,700
White.

473
00:25:45,700 --> 00:25:46,700
What color is this?

474
00:25:46,700 --> 00:25:47,700
White.

475
00:25:47,700 --> 00:25:48,700
What color is this?

476
00:25:48,700 --> 00:25:49,700
White.

477
00:25:49,700 --> 00:25:50,700
What do cows drink?

478
00:25:50,700 --> 00:25:51,700
Water.

479
00:25:51,700 --> 00:25:53,340
Ah, but you almost said milk.

480
00:25:53,340 --> 00:25:54,340
Oh, yeah.

481
00:25:54,340 --> 00:25:58,540
The trick is when someone says milk.

482
00:25:58,540 --> 00:25:59,540
Oh yeah.

483
00:25:59,540 --> 00:26:00,540
Make them look like an absolute fool.

484
00:26:00,540 --> 00:26:01,540
Yeah, I almost said milk.

485
00:26:01,540 --> 00:26:02,540
I've done that.

486
00:26:02,540 --> 00:26:03,540
Yeah, I've done that.

487
00:26:03,540 --> 00:26:04,540
You've done that to me before.

488
00:26:04,540 --> 00:26:05,540
Yeah, there's a few of those.

489
00:26:05,540 --> 00:26:10,180
I think the thing about that though is you don't really need the set up.

490
00:26:10,180 --> 00:26:13,460
You could just ask somebody what a cow drinks so they'd almost say milk most of the time,

491
00:26:13,460 --> 00:26:14,460
I feel like.

492
00:26:14,460 --> 00:26:15,460
What a toaster's milk.

493
00:26:15,460 --> 00:26:17,900
I would say milk, like if I was in a job interview, I'd say milk.

494
00:26:17,900 --> 00:26:19,540
I think cows do drink milk.

495
00:26:19,540 --> 00:26:20,540
No.

496
00:26:20,540 --> 00:26:21,540
Well, that's the thing.

497
00:26:21,540 --> 00:26:22,540
When they're babies, yeah.

498
00:26:22,540 --> 00:26:23,540
Of course they drink milk.

499
00:26:23,540 --> 00:26:25,540
Every mammal drinks fucking milk.

500
00:26:25,540 --> 00:26:26,040
No.

501
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:28,040
But then also they drink water later.

502
00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:29,040
You guys are wrong.

503
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:33,540
Oh, I thought about this on the way over here. I want to talk about this. I've been reading about

504
00:26:33,540 --> 00:26:43,540
feral people, people who are raised by wolves and shit, and there are people who have been raised by pigs.

505
00:26:43,540 --> 00:26:44,540
Really?

506
00:26:44,540 --> 00:26:49,540
That's so cool. Yeah, and they suck on pigs' nipples and they think they're a pig.

507
00:26:49,540 --> 00:26:51,040
Wow.

508
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:52,040
Isn't that cool?

509
00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:53,040
It is. It's crazy.

510
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:55,840
- You're finally opening up to us about your childhood.

511
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:58,180
- No, I wasn't raised by it.

512
00:26:58,180 --> 00:26:59,360
(laughing)

513
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:00,500
Isn't that cool, and that'd be like a cool guy

514
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:01,340
you wanna hang out with?

515
00:27:01,340 --> 00:27:02,280
(laughing)

516
00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:03,800
I just never should bring you guys,

517
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:05,560
like introduce you to my family ever.

518
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:06,960
(laughing)

519
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:09,240
I live on a farm out in nowhere.

520
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:10,080
- Too far to go to.

521
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:12,240
- I don't know, they're really conservative.

522
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:14,480
(laughing)

523
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:19,120
It is interesting, most of, the most feral humans

524
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:20,480
have been raised by wolves though.

525
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:21,320
- That's cool.

526
00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:22,160
- It's like the jungle.

527
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:27,480
really like babies I guess. Yeah well it's where it's it's it's dogs and humans the

528
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:32,480
eternal bond. Yeah yeah then they bred that out of pit bulls. Yeah pit bulls.

529
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:37,880
That's true. You never meet a person who was raised by pit bulls. I don't think it's that they bred it out of pit

530
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:42,320
bulls. I think they bred in hatred. Yeah. I think cuz like wolves will I think wolves

531
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:46,960
will raise a child. The wolves have the love in them. Yeah. But but pit bulls have

532
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:50,960
been there they've been spiritually strangled and smothered. Yeah pit bulls I do

533
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:54,160
feel like have a little bit of like alligator in them yeah look at their

534
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:58,720
heads they're kind of cold-blooded. Pipples look like a guy that just got turned into an animal

535
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:03,520
yeah yeah exactly exactly like we talked about this it looks like halfway between

536
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:09,440
like when when scrappy-doo is halfway between human and dog in the movie they do look like

537
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:13,520
that yeah they're like all muscly and what we I've been I've been seeing these things on Instagram

538
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:18,080
because I just get like dog shit on on like Instagram now where like guys will take photos

539
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:24,080
dog shit of New York. Dogs will take or people take photos of their pit bulls or

540
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:27,600
like Rottweilers that are just like ripped. They'll take photos of like how

541
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:31,200
ripped their backs are and like put them on Instagram like trying to get people

542
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:37,440
like fuck your dog. Like how hot my dog is. I think that like a

543
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:42,120
thousand years ago they like somebody showed a dog like did the like clockwork

544
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:45,400
orange thing to a dog and then that dog had a baby and that was like the start

545
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:51,840
of the pit bull lineage. Yeah. Like that was I think it's like a mental evil thing that's

546
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:55,620
followed them. Maybe a curse by a witch could have been the culprit. Also pit bulls will

547
00:28:55,620 --> 00:29:00,520
switch up on you. Oh yeah. They'll be normal. Dude, so scary. I fucking, I hate, it happens

548
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:07,260
to me like every few weeks I'll be walking down the sidewalk and I'll see like a pit

549
00:29:07,260 --> 00:29:11,980
bull, like somebody walking a pit bull like towards me and I'll look behind me and somebody

550
00:29:11,980 --> 00:29:15,560
else will be walking a different dog like behind me coming like you know that it's

551
00:29:15,560 --> 00:29:20,080
and I'm able to I'm like oh I'm about to lose my legs yeah this is it are the

552
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:26,620
soldiers and you are the battleground yeah yeah they said we're dueling at

553
00:29:26,620 --> 00:29:30,880
Cameron at noon I will genuinely cross the street if I if I see - if I see a

554
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:34,760
pitbull approaching another dog with with me and that is really funny I try

555
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:39,720
to rub their bellies crossing the street when you see a pitbull I don't trust

556
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:44,160
pipples is really funny because of it could come across really bad because of

557
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:54,640
who usually come across really racist I don't know you mean no it's can you

558
00:29:54,640 --> 00:30:00,800
explain what you're saying to me like no it's not you it's your fucking dog just

559
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:07,360
every day the same guys is walking it's not if I just see a people that's fine

560
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:11,920
I'm saying if it's a pincer formation, a people and another dog, okay, I will get

561
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:16,000
out of that situation. That's not okay with my what if it's a chihuahua. It

562
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:19,520
any dog. Are you kidding me? Slurp that thing up like spaghetti. Exactly. Yeah,

563
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:22,240
it's not that like the dogs are gonna fight. It's that the people is gonna eat

564
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:25,600
the other dog and it's gonna eat through my legs to eat the other dog burrow

565
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:29,840
through you. It will. It's gonna chomp a hole straight through your stomach into

566
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:34,240
the other dog. It's gonna dive through your body straight up and it's gonna

567
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:38,840
come back it's gonna do a Mortal Kombat fatality the dessert yeah I do I don't

568
00:30:38,840 --> 00:30:43,600
try I don't trust you sweet he looks mmm don't don't do that if I was a dog I'd

569
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:48,720
eat your meat don't say that I was so scared of dogs when I was a kid I was

570
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:53,600
like terrified like like yeah I and I grew out of it but I guess not for

571
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:58,640
pitbulls. I think I love dogs. I like dogs a lot. I was scared of big dogs and now I'm

572
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:07,480
scared of pitbulls. That's what I would have been like when I was like probably until I

573
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:14,680
was in like probably till I was like 14. Like I like a very very there was a dog that lived

574
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:19,480
like in the my neighbor had this like really mean dog that they just like whipped or whatever

575
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:22,200
to make it evil you know and I'll go out to play and it would just be like

576
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:27,400
just like the entire time I was outside. You know how dogs do that?

577
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:31,640
I'm gonna do a pizza check because I think my pizza is probably done.

578
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:36,840
It's Alex's pizza corner. Let's see what kind of pizza is it?

579
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:39,960
Oh yeah it's done. It's a little bit of everything.

580
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:44,520
Okay if you can't hear he said it's a little bit of everything.

581
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:46,520
What does that mean?

582
00:31:46,520 --> 00:31:48,360
He got a supreme pizza.

583
00:31:48,360 --> 00:31:52,360
Oh, that is a little bit of everything.

584
00:31:52,360 --> 00:31:59,640
I think I might like frozen pizza more than normal pizza.

585
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:00,640
Frozen pizza is really good.

586
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:04,520
I like frozen pizza more than any New York slice.

587
00:32:04,520 --> 00:32:06,360
Frozen pizza is great.

588
00:32:06,360 --> 00:32:10,240
When we were in Tampa, there was a bar where the only food they had was you could order

589
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:11,920
a frozen pizza and they'd just make it.

590
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:12,920
That's so sick.

591
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:14,400
There's some places around here that do that.

592
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:15,400
Really?

593
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:16,400
I've never seen that before.

594
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:24,340
the bell house does that best it's so tight dude it literally saved my life oh

North Pole slice. Mm-hmm. Oh, man

605
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:10,760
Tombstone, that shit's good.

606
00:33:10,760 --> 00:33:12,920
Tombstone is really good, dude, yeah.

607
00:33:12,920 --> 00:33:16,040
The pepperoni tombstone, dip that in some ketchup.

608
00:33:16,040 --> 00:33:17,720
What is wrong with you?

609
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:18,520
And some mustard.

610
00:33:18,520 --> 00:33:21,480
What? You can't eat on the mic.

611
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:23,960
You're not allowed to eat into the microphone.

612
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:26,440
You can eat, but you can't pick up the microphone while you eat.

613
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:27,000
Okay.

614
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:27,720
That's not allowed.

615
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:28,680
I'll just keep it right here.

616
00:33:28,680 --> 00:33:31,800
Just tempting you?

617
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:34,040
And no, you're not allowed to have any camera.

618
00:33:34,040 --> 00:33:35,000
I don't want any.

619
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:35,560
Not anymore.

620
00:33:35,560 --> 00:33:38,040
You lost your pizza privilege for saying that.

621
00:33:38,040 --> 00:33:39,240
Oh, but it looks so good!

622
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:53,520
I'm honestly surprised you picked the microphone over eating it.

623
00:33:53,520 --> 00:33:54,520
I would have just eaten it.

624
00:33:54,520 --> 00:33:55,520
Oh my god, it's so hot.

625
00:33:55,520 --> 00:33:56,520
That's why you can't eat it.

626
00:33:56,520 --> 00:33:57,520
Yeah, no, wait for that to cool.

627
00:33:57,520 --> 00:33:58,520
Yeah.

628
00:33:58,520 --> 00:33:59,520
It's good.

629
00:33:59,520 --> 00:34:01,760
How much time do we have left on the episode?

630
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:02,760
Like 30 minutes.

631
00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:03,760
Yeah, you got that.

632
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:04,760
You got that down.

633
00:34:04,760 --> 00:34:05,760
Yeah, it's fine.

634
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:06,760
It's really hot.

635
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:07,760
450 degrees.

636
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:12,860
yeah that seemed too high for a frozen pizza but I guess the perfect amount of time to wait for a

637
00:34:12,860 --> 00:34:15,940
pizza is like 20 minutes anyway so we can just spend the last 10 minutes of this

638
00:34:15,940 --> 00:34:21,820
episode watching him eat and saying how hungry we are. Sounds good to me. I don't think so. No? No.

639
00:34:21,820 --> 00:34:26,140
Why not? Because I got I got I don't want to get super hungry. I want to get super hungry.

640
00:34:26,140 --> 00:34:30,220
I'm getting lunch after this. I don't want to go you never want to go into a lunch that you're

641
00:34:30,220 --> 00:34:35,120
paying for super hungry. Yeah. Really? It's a mistake. I pregame lunch like it's a bar. You're

642
00:34:35,120 --> 00:34:37,720
You're crazy, I love going to a restaurant hungry.

643
00:34:37,720 --> 00:34:38,720
Me too.

644
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:39,720
I don't know about you guys.

645
00:34:39,720 --> 00:34:42,520
I always get something, if I'm too hungry I always get something fucked up.

646
00:34:42,520 --> 00:34:48,400
You go into like a, like going to the point, you're hungover, you wait until like 4 to

647
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:53,520
eat and then you order like the appetizer sampler at a diner.

648
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:54,640
What?

649
00:34:54,640 --> 00:34:55,640
It's so, it's good.

650
00:34:55,640 --> 00:34:56,640
I've done that many times.

651
00:34:56,640 --> 00:34:57,640
What do you mean?

652
00:34:57,640 --> 00:34:58,640
I've done that many times.

653
00:34:58,640 --> 00:34:59,640
Many times you've done that?

654
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:00,640
Yes.

655
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:01,640
What is on the appetizer?

656
00:35:01,640 --> 00:35:02,640

And the video games.

721
00:39:21,360 --> 00:39:22,360
We got the bathroom though.

722
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:23,360
That's true, you guys can't pee.

723
00:39:23,360 --> 00:39:26,280

730
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:37,120
If there was a small dog shit in this room, how many days do you think it would be till

731
00:39:37,120 --> 00:39:38,120
you guys found it?

732
00:39:38,120 --> 00:39:45,480
is a small dog shit in this room. It's like fossilized. Or like black mold or something.

733
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:49,600
I vacuumed in here before you guys showed up. No you didn't. There's no way. There's literally

734
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:54,480

735
00:39:54,480 --> 00:40:02,800
room. If you actually vacuumed, you should like go back to elementary school. You need

736
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:09,040
to do like occupational therapy. Pat should do Billy Madison. You need it like again. I did that when I

737
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:15,520
was uh I did that and all they all that I really got out of it was that um I was allowed to chew

738
00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:20,640
gum in school in elementary school. Really? Oh my god I should have done that shit. Dude I dude

739
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:26,240
the having a 504 plan you can just say like. Being having needing needing like a special education

740
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:29,360
accommodation stuff it's all it's it's it's cheating the system. Oh yeah. It just means you

741
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:31,920
to leave class whenever you want and draw pictures.

742
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:32,920
Yeah, yeah.

743
00:40:32,920 --> 00:40:37,360
I got longer on tests and I was allowed to chew gum in class because I said it helped

744
00:40:37,360 --> 00:40:38,360
me focus.

745
00:40:38,360 --> 00:40:39,360
That's the best I did.

746
00:40:39,360 --> 00:40:41,160
Y'all were both mad disabled.

747
00:40:41,160 --> 00:40:45,200
I was one of those kids who would just finish the test in like 10 minutes and not check

748
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:47,280
my answers or whatever and just hand it in.

749
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:50,240
And I still got like extra time on tests for like a thing.

750
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:54,600
So I just like get to like leave the room and go like walk around for like an hour for

751
00:40:54,600 --> 00:40:55,600
no reason.

752
00:40:55,600 --> 00:40:56,600
That's sick.

753
00:40:56,600 --> 00:40:57,600
Yeah.

754
00:40:57,600 --> 00:40:58,600

792
00:43:20,560 --> 00:43:22,560
Two spicy McBickens.

What is that called? You've been talking about that all fucking week.

797
00:43:32,560 --> 00:43:34,560
I don't know, it's just something that Juvio said.

798
00:43:34,560 --> 00:43:36,560
He said that that's a challenge that you do.

799
00:43:36,560 --> 00:43:38,560
We were in VR

800
00:43:38,560 --> 00:43:40,560
and he was just asking

801
00:43:40,560 --> 00:43:44,560
asking everybody if they could eat that in 20 minutes. It's making me laugh.

802
00:43:44,560 --> 00:43:47,560
Oh, you, someone, you asked, did you ask me that the other day?

803
00:43:47,560 --> 00:43:48,560
I probably did. Yeah.

804
00:43:48,560 --> 00:43:49,560
Could you do it?

805
00:43:49,560 --> 00:43:50,560
What is it?

806
00:43:50,560 --> 00:43:53,560
Four McChickens, two McDoubles.

807
00:43:53,560 --> 00:43:54,560
Four McChickens I could do.

808
00:43:54,560 --> 00:43:56,560
Two spicy McBickens.

809
00:43:56,560 --> 00:43:58,560
I could do that. I could eat six McChickens.

810
00:43:58,560 --> 00:43:59,560
Will you stop?

811
00:43:59,560 --> 00:44:01,560
You're fucking eating a challenge.

812
00:44:01,560 --> 00:44:02,560
You're scaring me.

813
00:44:02,560 --> 00:44:05,560
I don't give a fuck if you can eat part of the challenge.

814
00:44:05,560 --> 00:44:09,560
He can't let an item of food be said without saying.

815
00:44:09,560 --> 00:44:14,680
be said without saying I could eat that.

816
00:44:14,680 --> 00:44:19,640
Two McDoubles, a 20 piece McNugget, that's where you get caught up.

817
00:44:19,640 --> 00:44:21,240
Yeah, that's what would kill me.

818
00:44:21,240 --> 00:44:23,600
I think also, and then I think a McFlurry.

819
00:44:23,600 --> 00:44:26,520
No, that's where you lose me.

820
00:44:26,520 --> 00:44:28,200
God, I love a McDouble though.

821
00:44:28,200 --> 00:44:30,600
That might be my favorite item on the McDonald's menu.

822
00:44:30,600 --> 00:44:38,040
Well, the secret is, it's a 20 piece, so you hide like two to four chicken nuggets in every

823
00:44:38,040 --> 00:44:39,040
sandwich.

824
00:44:39,040 --> 00:44:40,040
it's less food that way.

825
00:44:40,040 --> 00:44:41,240
- Oh. - Yeah.

826
00:44:41,240 --> 00:44:43,000
- It actually reduces the amount of food.

827
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:44,760
- Oh my God. - You're tricking your brain.

828
00:44:44,760 --> 00:44:45,600
- You're tricking your brain

829
00:44:45,600 --> 00:44:47,360
into thinking it's less food.

830
00:44:47,360 --> 00:44:50,640
- I can't believe, you actually think that that would work.

831
00:44:50,640 --> 00:44:51,520
- Look, look man.

832
00:44:51,520 --> 00:44:52,960
- I know that you do.

833
00:44:52,960 --> 00:44:55,880
You think that it would work if you handed the McNuggets

834
00:44:55,880 --> 00:44:58,960
so that you don't individually eat it.

835
00:44:58,960 --> 00:45:00,800
(laughing)

836
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:01,640
- Yeah.

837
00:45:01,640 --> 00:45:05,760
- All you have to do is get two giant slices of bread

838
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:08,000
and put every piece of food in between them

839
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:09,600
- I pretend you're eating one.

840
00:45:09,600 --> 00:45:10,720
(laughing)

841
00:45:10,720 --> 00:45:11,880
- It's a good point.

842
00:45:11,880 --> 00:45:13,880
- The real trick is--

843
00:45:13,880 --> 00:45:16,480
- It's like hiding a pill in peanut butter for your dog.

844
00:45:16,480 --> 00:45:18,880
- Yeah, the pill doesn't work when you do that

845
00:45:18,880 --> 00:45:20,200
'cause they can't see it.

846
00:45:20,200 --> 00:45:21,040
- Exactly.

847
00:45:21,040 --> 00:45:23,480
- But I think that I couldn't even eat 20 McNuggets.

848
00:45:23,480 --> 00:45:28,040
- No, I would throw up within like 20 seconds

849
00:45:28,040 --> 00:45:29,360
of trying that challenge, I think.

850
00:45:29,360 --> 00:45:31,520
- I can't do that, I can't eat like a 20 piece

851
00:45:31,520 --> 00:45:32,480
McNugget anymore.

852
00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:34,480
- I couldn't do more than two McChickens, I feel like.

853
00:45:34,480 --> 00:45:36,200
- I don't really like the McNuggets anymore.

854
00:45:36,200 --> 00:45:37,440
Those were my go-to when I was a kid.

855
00:45:37,440 --> 00:45:42,040
pizza is really good. They just have such a leather exterior. Yeah, they're not good.

856
00:45:42,040 --> 00:45:46,760
Something changed and it's Michelle Obama's fault in 2012. That's right.

857
00:45:46,760 --> 00:45:50,840
You're not trying to make me healthy you fucking long arm bitch. Dude, they had Doritos

858
00:45:50,840 --> 00:45:55,200
Jacked. Get your big-ass arms out of my McDonald's. Stop reaching in there and flipping all this shit.

859
00:45:55,200 --> 00:46:00,280
You're trying to turn my McChicken into a McChicken salad. She's using her long arms to switch out my fries for

860
00:46:00,280 --> 00:46:04,280
apples. Fuck you, bitch. Yeah. And your man.

861
00:46:04,280 --> 00:46:06,280
Chicken salad. Not for me.

862
00:46:06,280 --> 00:46:10,280
If you want me to eat some kind of cranberry walnut salad at McDonald's...

863
00:46:10,280 --> 00:46:12,280
Then you're gonna have to blow me.

864
00:46:12,280 --> 00:46:14,280
Yep. That's right, Michelle Obama. Come on here.

865
00:46:14,280 --> 00:46:17,280
Come to the back. Blow me from the back.

866
00:46:17,280 --> 00:46:20,280
Come fucking... Oh, you want to get me to eat a grapefruit?

867
00:46:20,280 --> 00:46:24,280
How about you grapefruit technique my fucking dick while you blow me, Michelle Obama?

868
00:46:24,280 --> 00:46:26,280
Plus I get to see your armpits.

869
00:46:26,280 --> 00:46:29,280
And I'm eating chips while this is happening.

870
00:46:29,280 --> 00:46:35,120
yeah that's right and I'm rich and I'm the president and I'm Barack Obama

871
00:46:35,120 --> 00:46:38,920
and let me be clear, my fellow Americans, let me be clear

872
00:46:38,920 --> 00:46:43,120
six McChickens, what is it? four McChickens, could you eat?

873
00:46:43,120 --> 00:46:46,440
two McDoubles, four McChickens

874
00:46:46,440 --> 00:46:50,680
two spicy McBacons, a twenty piece McNugget

875
00:46:50,680 --> 00:46:53,680
and a McFlurry and that's what we're changing to school lunch

876
00:46:53,680 --> 00:46:57,520
and that's gonna be school lunch

877
00:46:57,520 --> 00:47:01,720
and that's what makes america great

878
00:47:01,720 --> 00:47:04,160
the republicans are saying you can't do it

879
00:47:04,160 --> 00:47:06,540
they don't think you can eat all the mcchickens

880
00:47:06,540 --> 00:47:09,160
or the double mcbickens

881
00:47:09,160 --> 00:47:11,220
i believe in you

882
00:47:11,220 --> 00:47:16,320
school lunch will be over one hundred hamburgers

883
00:47:16,320 --> 00:47:17,400
it's gonna be huge

884
00:47:17,400 --> 00:47:19,580
one hundred huge hamburgers

Encanto. Encanto. Encanto. Haven't seen it. Oh, you know what I saw the other day?

919
00:50:05,840 --> 00:50:10,240
What? Worst person in the world. Really good. What's this? Yeah, you looked in a mirror.

920
00:50:10,240 --> 00:50:17,840
Damn. Bro, they named all the like dogs from the like litter of dogs that I'm adopting my dog from,

921
00:50:17,840 --> 00:50:22,880
they're all named after fucking Encanto fucking characters. Really? My dog's name is Augustin.

922
00:50:24,400 --> 00:50:29,680
Augustin Madrigal is his name. He's played by fucking, what's his name?

923
00:50:29,680 --> 00:50:30,640
John Leguizamo?

924
00:50:30,640 --> 00:50:30,880
Yeah.

925
00:50:30,880 --> 00:50:32,640
That's actually...

926
00:50:32,640 --> 00:50:33,200
Kind of cool.

927
00:50:33,200 --> 00:50:34,960
You should name your dog John Leguizamo.

928
00:50:34,960 --> 00:50:36,080
His name's Phil.

929
00:50:36,080 --> 00:50:36,320
Yeah.

930
00:50:36,320 --> 00:50:37,040
That's a good name.

931
00:50:37,040 --> 00:50:38,240
I think it's a funny name for a dog.

932
00:50:38,240 --> 00:50:40,400
Human names for a dog are always going to be good.

933
00:50:40,400 --> 00:50:45,360
Yeah. As long as it's one syllable. If you go past one syllable, you're getting into fucking stupid.

934
00:50:45,360 --> 00:50:50,720
Dude, you guys got fucked up. Listen, this is Augustin Madrigal. So it's like,

935
00:50:50,720 --> 00:50:52,720
Encanto's about like a magic family, right?

936
00:50:52,720 --> 00:50:53,360
Yeah.

937
00:50:53,360 --> 00:50:57,120
"Having married into the family, Augustin has no magical gift of his own.

938
00:50:57,120 --> 00:51:03,040
However, his accident-prone tendencies allow his wife to continuously refine her healing magic."

939
00:51:03,040 --> 00:51:07,280
He is kind of stupid. The lady that we're adopting the dog from is like, "Yeah,

940
00:51:07,280 --> 00:51:09,600
he's like the slow one from the litter."

941
00:51:09,600 --> 00:51:09,840
Yeah.

942
00:51:09,840 --> 00:51:12,640
This guy's thing is that he just gets hurt a lot.

943
00:51:12,640 --> 00:51:13,360
That's funny.

944
00:51:13,360 --> 00:51:14,560
Yeah, I'm reading the wiki right now.

945
00:51:14,560 --> 00:51:19,040
You can tell that he's dumber than all the other dogs because in the photos of all the dogs,

946
00:51:19,760 --> 00:51:23,040
like all the other dogs are like like look like cute young puppies and then he's

947
00:51:23,040 --> 00:51:28,000
like has all both all of his legs are like turned in and he's like he like

948
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:31,320

951
00:51:41,720 --> 00:51:45,040
piece of trivia about Augustin so keep keep this in mind when you get your dog

952
00:51:45,040 --> 00:51:49,160
yeah this is a piece of trivia from the Disney wiki similar to Winnie the Pooh

953
00:51:49,160 --> 00:51:53,960
Augustin has a conflict with bees. I think most dogs have a conflict with bees.

954
00:51:53,960 --> 00:51:59,960
I don't think dogs, people and things have a conflict. Yeah, nobody really likes bees all that much unless you're in armor.

955
00:51:59,960 --> 00:52:05,200
Bees suck. Unless you're in armor? Yeah, you know that armor they wear? It's true. Oh, like the beekeepers?

956
00:52:05,200 --> 00:52:09,560
Yeah, I thought you meant like a knight. I do kind of want to do a bee beard. A bee beard?

957
00:52:09,560 --> 00:52:14,760
You know when you put when people, oh yeah, people make a beard out of bees. Who's it? Big Sean just did like a music video

958
00:52:14,760 --> 00:52:19,080
video no one saw and he's like covered in bees. That's got a sting. They did that in

959
00:52:19,080 --> 00:52:24,680
the new Jackass. What up? That was good. Yeah. His penis. They put the queen bee on his wee-wee.

960
00:52:24,680 --> 00:52:27,760
The queen? Yeah and all that. They all make a big, they make a big. You haven't seen it

961
00:52:27,760 --> 00:52:31,880
yet? You haven't seen it? Oh man it's really good. It is really good. I would see it again

962
00:52:31,880 --> 00:52:36,400
if you want to see it. I'll see it. I'd be down next week. Alright. Yeah. Okay. Is it

963
00:52:36,400 --> 00:52:40,760
an IMAX? No. Oh come on. I know they should have put it in IMAX. Is it in 3D? I don't

964
00:52:40,760 --> 00:52:42,760
Jackass 3 was in 3D, what are they doing?

965
00:52:42,760 --> 00:52:44,760
Well they should have put this one in 4D.

966
00:52:44,760 --> 00:52:46,760
No it's not.

967
00:52:46,760 --> 00:52:48,760
They have a guy come into the theater and shit on the floor.

968
00:52:48,760 --> 00:52:50,760
4D Jackass would be so funny.

969
00:52:50,760 --> 00:52:52,760
That would be great. Scratch and sniff Jackass.

970
00:52:52,760 --> 00:52:54,760
That would be awesome.

971
00:52:54,760 --> 00:52:56,760
Guy walks in and shits on the floor

972
00:52:56,760 --> 00:52:58,760
whenever, at least in the theater I was in.

973
00:52:58,760 --> 00:53:00,760
Somebody got into the theater

974
00:53:00,760 --> 00:53:02,760
and started doing Jackass shit.

975
00:53:02,760 --> 00:53:04,760
Kicking people in the balls and stuff.

976
00:53:04,760 --> 00:53:06,760
Yeah but he said he was a king.

977
00:53:06,760 --> 00:53:08,760
That was his thing. He walked in and he kept saying

978
00:53:08,760 --> 00:53:16,600
like I'm the king of France. I don't think he said that. He said that. No. Me and Joe went to see-

979
00:53:16,600 --> 00:53:21,320
He's wearing bags as clothes. Me and Joe went to see Jackass and we- I probably told you this-

980
00:53:21,320 --> 00:53:25,800
we ended up at the same theater by accident. Oh yeah. We went to see it separately but we went

981
00:53:25,800 --> 00:53:31,400
to the same show. Well the the the power of Jackass. I know it brings friends together. It is

982
00:53:31,400 --> 00:53:36,840
one of the it is one of the best movies of this year snubbed at the Oscars. Yeah. For best picture.

983
00:53:36,840 --> 00:53:41,240
Does it, is it even eligible? Didn't it just come out? I would say Don't Look Up is the best movie of the year.

984
00:53:41,240 --> 00:53:48,120
Scary. Oh, they should make another movie called Don't Look Up, but it's about pornography. Yeah,

985
00:53:48,120 --> 00:53:52,760
they should do one about every obvious social issue in the world. They could make a bunch of

986
00:53:52,760 --> 00:53:56,920
sequels and call it Don't Look Up, colon, and then like whatever you're not supposed to look up. Yeah.

987
00:53:56,920 --> 00:54:03,480
Yeah. Oh, that's a good idea. Yeah. Don't Look Up, bomb recipe. Exactly. Don't look that up. Yeah,

988
00:54:03,480 --> 00:54:04,580
- Yeah, they could do a whole movie

989
00:54:04,580 --> 00:54:05,880
about how you're not supposed to look that up.

990
00:54:05,880 --> 00:54:06,720
Yep, that's another good one.

991
00:54:06,720 --> 00:54:09,120
- I think you can look up crystal meth recipe.

992
00:54:09,120 --> 00:54:11,600
- Don't look up Brussels sprout recipe.

993
00:54:11,600 --> 00:54:12,920
- Yeah, 'cause it's too--

994
00:54:12,920 --> 00:54:15,520
- Don't look up Patrick Doran arrest record.

995
00:54:15,520 --> 00:54:16,960
(laughing)

996
00:54:16,960 --> 00:54:20,080
- Don't look up Patrick Doran 2017.

997
00:54:20,080 --> 00:54:20,920
- Yeah, never been arrested.

998
00:54:20,920 --> 00:54:22,480
- It doesn't exist, so you might as well not even try.

999
00:54:22,480 --> 00:54:25,040
- Yeah, so it basically doesn't exist, right?

1000
00:54:25,040 --> 00:54:25,880
- No.

1001
00:54:25,880 --> 00:54:26,700
- Yeah.

1002
00:54:26,700 --> 00:54:30,080
- It exists, I've been arrested for bank robbery.

1003
00:54:30,080 --> 00:54:33,480
No, it was actually a misdemeanor charge.

1004
00:54:33,480 --> 00:54:36,480
You barely missed a minor.

1005
00:54:36,480 --> 00:54:38,600
And that's what you got arrested for.

1006
00:54:38,600 --> 00:54:39,600
I was arrested for...

1007
00:54:39,600 --> 00:54:40,680
No, you shot one out.

1008
00:54:40,680 --> 00:54:41,680
You barely missed a minor.

1009
00:54:41,680 --> 00:54:44,120
I was arrested for graffiti in 2017.

1010
00:54:44,120 --> 00:54:48,840
You tried to tag your name on a child like you owned it.

1011
00:54:48,840 --> 00:54:50,200
Were you really arrested for graffiti?

1012
00:54:50,200 --> 00:54:51,200
No.

1013
00:54:51,200 --> 00:54:52,200
Oh, okay.

1014
00:54:52,200 --> 00:54:54,440
I was just trying to get around them calling me a pedophile.

1015
00:54:54,440 --> 00:54:55,440
Sure.

1016
00:54:55,440 --> 00:54:57,800
I wasn't saying that at all.

1017
00:54:57,800 --> 00:54:59,940
i was saying i was a player shoplifter

1018
00:54:59,940 --> 00:55:02,320
uh... which is actually worse

1019
00:55:02,320 --> 00:55:06,760
uh... small businesses and uh... yeah

1020
00:55:06,760 --> 00:55:10,320
dot instead of doing small business

1021
00:55:10,320 --> 00:55:12,280

1022
00:55:12,280 --> 00:55:16,280

are you guys are going to a list on this episode

1025
00:55:23,400 --> 00:55:30,600
No, we don't do lists on the premium ones. Oh, I didn't know that. That's right. You're premium. You're gold standard. Yeah, cool

1026
00:55:30,600 --> 00:55:33,960
How's that feel feels pretty good. I like that you

00:55:33,960 --> 00:55:37,160
You were you waited to bring that up until there's five minutes

1028
00:55:37,160 --> 00:55:41,960
So, uh guys

1029
00:55:41,960 --> 00:55:44,120
This is a list start

1030
00:55:44,120 --> 00:55:49,880
We should just do a three-hour episode make pat late for everything he has to do today. Yeah. Yeah as payback

1031
00:55:50,280 --> 00:55:57,640
Yeah, for every time for three years. Yeah, I said I'm it's fine. I can I can just tell them. I'm not like I'm gonna be late

1032
00:55:57,640 --> 00:55:59,320
Fuck

1033
00:55:59,320 --> 00:56:03,320
Damn, he's too good at being valuable. We'll do it another time. Yeah, that's right

1034
00:56:03,320 --> 00:56:08,520
Wait, so when you have something really important coming up, we're just gonna make you so late to it. Yeah

1035
00:56:08,520 --> 00:56:14,920
Just fuck you your wedding. Yeah, pat. Oh, yeah, pat. We need to record an hour before your surgery

1036
00:56:14,920 --> 00:56:17,240
I hope that's okay and you're gonna eat a bunch of food

1037
00:56:18,200 --> 00:56:22,200
Yeah, we're doing a food challenge right before your surgery.

1038
00:56:22,200 --> 00:56:25,200
We're going to do a magnet eating challenge before your MRI.

1039
00:56:25,200 --> 00:56:30,200
You have to eat those little magnets that you throw in the air and they make rattlesnakes out.

1040
00:56:30,200 --> 00:56:34,200
I get kind of worried. I think I probably have a coin in my body and if I go do an MRI.

1041
00:56:34,200 --> 00:56:36,200
Coins don't get attracted by an MRI. They're not magnetic.

1042
00:56:36,200 --> 00:56:39,200
I have a super magnet coin that I got from a magic set.

1043
00:56:39,200 --> 00:56:41,200
Is it cool to hold a microphone like this?

1044
00:56:41,200 --> 00:56:42,200
No.

1045
00:56:42,200 --> 00:56:43,200
It's not cool?

1046
00:56:43,200 --> 00:56:44,200
I'm thinking about doing that in the future.

1047
00:56:44,200 --> 00:56:45,200
Oh, that's how Anthony Jeselnik does.

1048
00:56:45,200 --> 00:56:46,200
Yeah?

1049
00:56:46,200 --> 00:56:47,200
Yeah.

1050
00:56:47,200 --> 00:56:50,400
And a baby was killed.

1051
00:56:50,400 --> 00:56:54,200
Yeah, and then a woman actually died.

1052
00:56:54,200 --> 00:56:58,200
I farted on a woman's corpse.

1053
00:56:58,200 --> 00:57:00,200
What does he sound like?

1054
00:57:00,200 --> 00:57:03,700
They're saying I farted on a woman's corpse.

1055
00:57:03,700 --> 00:57:08,200
They're saying I farted on a woman, and I pooped in her mouth.

1056
00:57:08,200 --> 00:57:11,200
That would be so...

1057
00:57:11,200 --> 00:57:13,200
And I did that. I did all of that.

1058
00:57:13,200 --> 00:57:16,800
the piss tape or whatever and it was like farting stuff he was like farting on people

1059
00:57:16,800 --> 00:57:20,800
well i you know i forgot it i was so that's why he just mentioned it

1060
00:57:20,800 --> 00:57:26,320
i was so mad that it didn't exist well also the thing is like if it definitely exists

1061
00:57:26,320 --> 00:57:32,160
there was a video 100 no it's not real it's not real okay well tom arnold was on it it's not

1062
00:57:32,160 --> 00:57:36,640
like tom arnold was on that case it's not it's not real he's definitely doing shit like that

1063
00:57:36,640 --> 00:57:41,040
though i mean he's a he's like i'm sure he did it but he's he's he's a genius he's not gonna get

1064
00:57:41,040 --> 00:57:46,600

1065
00:57:46,600 --> 00:57:51,080
shapeshift into anything yeah exactly Trump looks like that because he's like

1066
00:57:51,080 --> 00:57:56,880
he's clay he was he's orange clay the other thing is if he was pissing on if

1067
00:57:56,880 --> 00:58:01,520
he's pissing on girls and fucking hot women of making them eat his farts I

1068
00:58:01,520 --> 00:58:05,360
think his approval rating would have gone way up yeah yeah there's like it's

1069
00:58:05,360 --> 00:58:08,720
definitely if he was the one doing the pissing but it wasn't the thing that he

1070
00:58:08,720 --> 00:58:12,800
was getting pissed on Chuck Berry sold still our albums after that no things

1071
00:58:12,800 --> 00:58:16,400
people who like him are just gonna be like that's cool well I don't like him

1072
00:58:16,400 --> 00:58:19,920
because he gets pissed on you know and then the people don't like him or get

00:58:19,920 --> 00:58:22,360

00:58:37,640 --> 00:58:42,240
We have found a video of Donald Trump peeing in the bathroom.

1077
00:58:42,240 --> 00:58:44,920
He does not lift the toilet seat before he pees into the toilet.

1078
00:58:44,920 --> 00:58:46,720
He gets it all over the seat.

1079
00:58:46,720 --> 00:58:48,440
He pulls his pants all the way down.

1080
00:58:48,440 --> 00:58:52,760
And then his son comes in and sits down on the toilet and he gets his dad's pee all over

1081
00:58:52,760 --> 00:58:53,760
his butt.

1082
00:58:53,760 --> 00:58:54,760
And he gets pregnant.

You guys ever suck your thumbs? I was big into that when I was a kid.

1102
01:00:06,700 --> 01:00:09,580
I knew this girl who sucked- I didn't do it because I knew this girl who sucked her

Ugh, yeah. Gross.

My name was Lauren.

1106
01:00:14,540 --> 01:00:16,620
Why did you say it like that?

1107
01:00:16,620 --> 01:00:19,340
I fucking hated her. She was so annoying.

1108
01:00:19,340 --> 01:00:19,740
Yeah.

sucking your fucking thumb for a decade.

1111
01:00:25,980 --> 01:00:31,740
I sucked my thumb until whenever Madagascar came out because I remember I saw that movie.

1112
01:00:31,740 --> 01:00:32,460
I think I was like seven.

1113
01:00:32,460 --> 01:00:33,660
There's a thumb thing in that, right?

1114
01:00:33,660 --> 01:00:35,660
They make fun of Alex the Lion because he sucks his thumb.

Like, that's straighter schizophrenia than most people.

1119
01:00:41,820 --> 01:00:45,020
That happened to Brian Wilson.

He like went to see that movie Seconds and like the main character in that movie is named like,
