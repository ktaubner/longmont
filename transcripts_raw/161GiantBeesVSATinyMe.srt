1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,580
(upbeat music)

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:09,840
(howling)

3
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:12,800
- Does that make you sad?

4
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:14,080
- That was less than a second.

5
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:15,600
I said a second after I clapped and that was--

6
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:17,040
- Does that make you sad?

7
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:18,480
- What, a go?

8
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:19,320
- A dog.

9
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:20,140
- Try it.

10
00:00:20,140 --> 00:00:20,980
- A dog making a sound.

11
00:00:20,980 --> 00:00:22,160
- See if this is what you actually--

12
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:24,800
(howling)

13
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:26,080
- That makes me happy.

14
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:28,400
- That's, yeah, that's not that bad to me.

15
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:29,240
You know what it sounds like?

16
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:33,000
Here's the thing, dog being sad, oh it's breaking my heart.

17
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,680
A wolf being sad, fuck you wolf.

18
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:36,680
Yeah.

19
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:37,680
Fuck you.

20
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:38,840
I trust a wolf more than a dog.

21
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:40,440
Fucking suck my dick you fucking wolf.

22
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:41,440
Suck your dick?

23
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:42,440
Not really man.

24
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:43,440
You want a wolf to suck you?

25
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:45,000
They got huge teeth, I don't want a wolf to suck my dick.

26
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,440
I don't think a wolf knows how to suck.

27
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:51,880
What do you mean?

28
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:53,880
I don't want a wolf to suck my dick.

29
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:54,880
You're stroking your beard.

30
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:56,800
Give me this one thing dude.

31
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:57,840
Just let me have this.

32
00:00:57,840 --> 00:00:59,940
You can't grow a beard.

33
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:00,780
Not like me.

34
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:02,040
- Look at my shit right now.

35
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:02,880
- Oh man.

36
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:04,920
- Saying I can't grow a beard.

37
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:05,960
What's this then?

38
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:07,080
Don't touch it!

39
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:09,200
It's seriously, I'm allergic to you!

40
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:10,040
Stop.

41
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:11,120
- I just touched you.

42
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:12,760
I just touched you, you're gonna break out in hives, bitch.

43
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:14,400
- I'm gonna break you out in my hive.

44
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:15,240
- I'm gonna break your hive in.

45
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:16,080
- And me and my thousands of brothers.

46
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:18,560
- Break out of the hive would be a good movie

47
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:20,440
about being kidnapped by bees.

48
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:21,280
- Yep.

49
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:22,200
- Why would it be a good movie?

50
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:23,320
- Break out of the hive.

51
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:25,440
- Break out the hive, you bee.

52
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:27,400
- The hive is not that big.

53
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:29,120
Break out that damn hive, bee.

54
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:31,200
Godspeed, you black and yellow bee.

55
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:34,400
It's either either giant bees or tiny me's.

56
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:35,520
Yeah.

57
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:37,560
Giant bees versus tiny me.

58
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:39,320
[LAUGHTER]

59
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:40,680
Have you guys ever seen that video?

60
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:42,960
Giant bees versus tiny me.

61
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:44,760
That is an amazing title.

62
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:45,720
That's an amazing idea.

63
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:47,600
You came up with gold just there.

64
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:48,200
Just there.

65
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:49,120
Just there.

66
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:50,760
That would be a good movie, though.

67
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:52,240
Yeah, tiny bees versus--

68
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:52,880
No.

69
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:53,600
No, sorry.

70
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:54,760
Giant bees versus tiny me.

71
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:57,040
Because tiny bees versus giant me is normal.

72
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:58,240
Yeah, that's not a movie.

73
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:00,640
Giant bees versus tiny me's is pretty good.

74
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:02,040
Yeah, and there's a lot of me.

75
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:02,540
Yeah.

76
00:02:02,540 --> 00:02:06,640
So is it one, is it just a couple bees and a whole lot of me's?

77
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:07,140
Yeah.

78
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:08,140
It would be a lot of bees.

79
00:02:08,140 --> 00:02:09,640
Who do you guys think would win?

80
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:16,040
100 duck-sized horses or one horse-sized horse?

81
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:17,140
No, let's get into this.

82
00:02:17,140 --> 00:02:21,040
100 duck-sized horses versus one horse-sized horse.

83
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:22,840
No, let's attack this from all angles.

84
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:23,940
What do you think, Woodwin?

85
00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:26,740
One duck-sized duck or 100 horse-sized horses?

86
00:02:26,740 --> 00:02:29,740
This is the kind of question that we could go on for hours.

87
00:02:29,740 --> 00:02:30,740
One duck-sized duck.

88
00:02:30,740 --> 00:02:31,740
Okay.

89
00:02:31,740 --> 00:02:32,740
You said one duck-sized duck.

90
00:02:32,740 --> 00:02:37,740
One duck-sized duck or 100 horse-sized horses or 100 planet-sized destroyers.

91
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:40,740
I'm gonna go with the destroyers.

92
00:02:40,740 --> 00:02:42,740
Which one would you rather fight, dude?

93
00:02:42,740 --> 00:02:45,740
A horse-sized duck or a thousand duck-sized horses?

94
00:02:45,740 --> 00:02:46,740
Let's get into this.

95
00:02:46,740 --> 00:02:47,740
Okay, let's hit it.

96
00:02:47,740 --> 00:02:48,740
Yeah.

97
00:02:48,740 --> 00:02:51,740
If I was a grizzly bear, I would win against both.

98
00:02:51,740 --> 00:02:52,740
Yeah, well, it doesn't matter.

99
00:02:52,740 --> 00:02:53,740
It doesn't matter?

100
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:54,740
No, no, no.

101
00:02:54,740 --> 00:02:55,740
It's about who would win between the duck-sized duck.

102
00:02:55,740 --> 00:02:58,140
size. Oh, he said, who would you rather? Which am I?

103
00:02:58,140 --> 00:02:59,820
You're the dark Santa.

104
00:02:59,820 --> 00:03:03,900
You're Santa. Actually, Santa wins Santa versus everybody like a Detroit versus

105
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:05,420
everybody shirt. Yeah, that's what I'm talking about.

106
00:03:05,420 --> 00:03:08,180
Everybody might be a pretty good.

107
00:03:08,180 --> 00:03:10,420
I almost wrote Santa versus everybody.

108
00:03:10,420 --> 00:03:11,620
I did.

109
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:14,900
I wrote it, but I did write a song.

110
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:16,260
I did write a Christmas rap.

111
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:17,660
Yeah, we're not going to save that.

112
00:03:17,660 --> 00:03:20,260
I feel like maybe I did write a Christmas.

113
00:03:20,260 --> 00:03:21,220
Would you want to do the right now?

114
00:03:21,220 --> 00:03:23,140
At the right at the top. OK, I did.

115
00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:25,300
Can we before me? Can we check in on Santa first?

116
00:03:25,340 --> 00:03:32,580
Yeah, oh, yeah, yeah, can I just say yeah before we go any further I wrote a Christmas rap that does have

117
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:39,260
Themes of that are similar to what we were just talking about and it's crazy that that was that was brought up

118
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:44,020
It's almost as if you read my rap. I didn't read I'm not a rap read. It's also it is truly

119
00:03:44,020 --> 00:03:49,860
I truly almost I wrote one line of Santa versus everybody and then I said I don't want to do this

120
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:53,020
It's too much work. I couldn't read your rap because a rap doesn't make any sense to me

121
00:03:53,020 --> 00:03:57,020
I'm one of those people where people are rapping and I just don't know what they're talking about.

122
00:03:57,020 --> 00:04:00,020
I typically don't listen to rap or read rap, I listen to it.

123
00:04:00,020 --> 00:04:01,020
I don't even do that.

124
00:04:01,020 --> 00:04:02,020
I feel it.

125
00:04:02,020 --> 00:04:03,020
I don't do any of that.

126
00:04:03,020 --> 00:04:05,020
I don't understand the words but I feel the emotion behind it.

127
00:04:05,020 --> 00:04:07,020
I don't listen to it, I avoid it.

128
00:04:07,020 --> 00:04:09,020
I understand the inflections.

129
00:04:09,020 --> 00:04:12,020
I don't understand what they're saying but I can tell it means something.

130
00:04:12,020 --> 00:04:13,020
Yeah, absolutely.

131
00:04:13,020 --> 00:04:15,020
Alright, let's check in on Santa.

132
00:04:15,020 --> 00:04:17,020
Yeah, let's see where Santa's at today.

133
00:04:17,020 --> 00:04:20,020
Let's pull up the Santa tracker that we have, our software.

134
00:04:20,020 --> 00:04:22,020
Oh, well he's still on Earth, guys.

135
00:04:22,020 --> 00:04:24,020
Oh, that's good. Now. Where's this?

136
00:04:24,020 --> 00:04:29,540
Near the North Hawaii. Yes, this is Hawaii. I think it looks like Hawaii. Oh, my shit

137
00:04:29,540 --> 00:04:34,500
I'm Motel 6 in the Arctic. They have Arctic they have Motel 6. Why is he at a Motel 6?

138
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:36,500
Is he the hell could be staying there? Oh

139
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:41,900
It's December, why is it the

140
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:47,020
Bigger oh my god. He's getting bigger, but don't cry. Don't cry scary. Oh

141
00:04:48,660 --> 00:04:55,260
Okay, don't wait bigger Santa get smaller there. We there you go, but what's he doing not at his house

142
00:04:55,260 --> 00:04:59,460
He's at a motel. Fuck if I know dude something must be kind of off over it

143
00:04:59,460 --> 00:05:09,620
What's the fuck did you do Santa white bitch is being an adulterer and he's fucking bald

144
00:05:09,620 --> 00:05:14,740
Jesus it's a bald under the hat and he has oh my god. He is

145
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:18,300
He has mystical sigils behind him.

146
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:21,300
Look how scared he is.

147
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:26,300
Look how unhappy she looks.

148
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:28,300
I can't tell if that... Here's the thing though.

149
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:31,300
We don't know that he's cheating. That could be just a goth child.

150
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:32,300
Yeah.

151
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:34,300
That could be Mrs. Claus and that's his mom.

152
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:35,300
Yeah, we don't know.

153
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:37,300
We don't know. We don't have all the facts.

154
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:40,300
The only facts we have is that Motel 6 is sad and this happened.

155
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:44,300
You'd think that Santa would be able to afford something better than Motel 6.

156
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:48,860
6 all those sponsorship deals he's doing sprite commercials yeah yeah Santa's

157
00:05:48,860 --> 00:05:53,380

00:06:16,180 --> 00:06:17,180
Waltham.

164
00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:18,180
Fake New Englander.

Wow.

166
00:06:19,180 --> 00:06:20,180
I thought it was called Waltham.

We caught him.

168
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:22,180
I've heard people say Waltham.

169
00:06:22,180 --> 00:06:23,180

Fake, dude.

174
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:28,180
Haverhill.

175
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:29,180
Completely fake.

176
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:30,180
Oh my God.

177
00:06:30,180 --> 00:06:31,180
Fuck you.

178
00:06:31,180 --> 00:06:32,180
That one's Haverhill.

179
00:06:32,180 --> 00:06:33,180
Haverhill.

180
00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:34,180
You dumbass Haverhill.

181
00:06:34,180 --> 00:06:35,180
Me dumbass?

182
00:06:35,180 --> 00:06:36,180
Yeah, you dumbass?

183
00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:37,180
I'm from North Carolina.

184
00:06:37,180 --> 00:06:38,180
I don't give a fuck about...

185
00:06:38,180 --> 00:06:39,180
You dumbass bitch.

186
00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:40,180
We got a place.

187
00:06:40,180 --> 00:06:41,180
Oh, you're from North Carolina, right?

188
00:06:41,180 --> 00:06:42,180
Yeah.

189
00:06:42,180 --> 00:06:43,180
No.

190
00:06:43,180 --> 00:06:45,180
You're not even saying that right. It's Bolivia.

191
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:47,180
There's no O.

192
00:06:47,180 --> 00:06:51,180
Bolivia. Shut up man. We should play a game where you guys have to pronounce normal words.

193
00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:53,180
Yeah. Yeah. Worcestershire sauce.

194
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:55,180
No. That's not a normal word.

195
00:06:55,180 --> 00:06:57,180
That's far from normal.

196
00:06:57,180 --> 00:06:59,180
What's a...

197
00:06:59,180 --> 00:07:01,180
Yeah so say the word we're supposed to pronounce and we'll pronounce it.

198
00:07:01,180 --> 00:07:03,180
Western Central South America.

199
00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:05,180
Let's just do our chants.

200
00:07:05,180 --> 00:07:07,180
Or our cray-rolls.

201
00:07:07,180 --> 00:07:09,180
We wrote some Christmas cray-rolls.

202
00:07:09,180 --> 00:07:11,180
For today. I mean continuing the Christmas

203
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:14,980
Christmas coverage. Everyone knows December full Christmas. We're doing 360

204
00:07:14,980 --> 00:07:19,580
degrees on Christmas. 360 days of Christmas. A Christmas perspective.

205
00:07:19,580 --> 00:07:25,540
And a lot of you might be saying, Caleb you already wore this

207
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:33,980

208
00:07:33,980 --> 00:07:43,460
everybody I'm exactly exactly what happened before the episode see right

209
00:07:43,460 --> 00:07:51,700
here is completely look don't rip it more I'm not trying to rip it more I'm just

210
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:57,500
showing the how ripped it is it's okay to have ripped pants learn that from Bob

211
00:07:57,500 --> 00:07:59,500
No, no learn that from

212
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:02,420
Shit out of me Lenny Kravitz

213
00:08:02,420 --> 00:08:08,120
SpongeBob Square remember Lenny Kravitz split his huge dick dick flew out and he had a ring on it

214
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:17,420
Yeah, where's some fucking underwear thing pointed out of his pants like a finger yeah, dude

215
00:08:17,420 --> 00:08:20,840
I won't even show it online not a big

216
00:08:21,780 --> 00:08:26,140
on Bing. Look up Lenny Kravitz penis. That's how disturbing it was. You google Santa Claus

217
00:08:26,140 --> 00:08:30,340
on Bing and it shows you a guy eating poop. You google Lenny Kravitz penis and it won't

218
00:08:30,340 --> 00:08:37,340
show it to you. There it is. Pull that up. That is not Lenny Kravitz. I don't think either

219
00:08:37,340 --> 00:08:44,620
of those two people are Lenny Kravitz. That's Merlin Gate. Dude. Alright. Wait, wait, there's

220
00:08:45,220 --> 00:08:51,460
the gift right there. No, don't show this to Lenny Kravitz. Don't show that. You can show

221
00:08:51,460 --> 00:08:57,860
this Fortnite guy. That's Lenny Kravitz nowadays. Yeah, that's what happened to him after all

222
00:08:57,860 --> 00:09:03,500
that. He put on more clothes. Do you think his daughter saw his penis? His daughter definitely

223
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:08,020
saw his penis every day she was raised by him. Yeah. Do you think his daughter Zoe saw

224
00:09:08,020 --> 00:09:12,380
that on the news and was like, "Damn, my dad's penis is out." Probably said, "Damn, my dad's

225
00:09:12,380 --> 00:09:18,620
penis is huge. You think her penis is as big as her dad's? She's got a big clit that poked

226
00:09:18,620 --> 00:09:27,780
through the Batgirl costume. Yeah. I'll say it, I will never ever meet her. That is just

227
00:09:27,780 --> 00:09:33,020
not gonna happen. That's not the kind of life I plan on living. Yeah. I will never meet her

228
00:09:33,020 --> 00:09:41,120
and she has a big, stinky, bright red Rudolph clit. It's nasty. Her pink hair is a little

229
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:45,840
emo in the movie. That's a pink hair in that movie? It's a pink, she puts pink

230
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:49,640
hair on in the movie I believe. Here's the thing about Batman. I believe. He was a

231
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:56,120
he was a tad emo. Yeah. It's like Batman is supposed to be. He was kind of like me in a way.

232
00:09:56,120 --> 00:10:04,360
More like this guy in the costume. That's a terrible parody. Batman in the shirt.

233
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:07,760
I just thought of it right on the spot. You guys both shut up because this is the parody.

234
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:10,760
Jokers in the way.

235
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:12,760
Jokers not in that movie.

236
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:14,760
Well he's at the very end. He's not in the way though.

237
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:16,760
Jokers in the jail.

238
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:18,760
Yeah. That's okay.

239
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:21,760
The Riddlers in the way.

240
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:23,760
Yeah. He is in the way.

241
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:25,760
Penguin.

242
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:31,760
The penguins in the way.

243
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:33,760
That would be a perfect,

244
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:35,760
that movie would have been a perfect candidate

245
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:39,900
it for having a rock and roll or a rap song in the credits that says the events

246
00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:40,460
of the movie.

247
00:10:40,460 --> 00:10:41,460
True.

248
00:10:41,460 --> 00:10:42,380
Bring it back.

249
00:10:42,380 --> 00:10:43,940
Yeah, or just a remix of that.

250
00:10:43,940 --> 00:10:46,420
The penguin was in the way.

251
00:10:46,420 --> 00:10:50,660
That's another reason the Addams Family movie is so good.

252
00:10:50,660 --> 00:10:52,040
That's a great parody.

253
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:56,700
The penguin's in the way, the Batgirl's in the movie, the Riddler's in the way,

254
00:10:56,700 --> 00:10:58,060
the Joker's in jail.

255
00:10:58,060 --> 00:11:01,540
Yeah, because that's also the that's that happens in the order.

256
00:11:01,540 --> 00:11:02,540
That's the order.

257
00:11:02,540 --> 00:11:03,820
Yeah, that's the order.

258
00:11:03,820 --> 00:11:06,960
Speaking of singing, we have these beautiful carols.

259
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:07,740
Yep.

260
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:10,020
Who wants to go first?

261
00:11:10,020 --> 00:11:11,860
I feel like you're usually Mr. First.

262
00:11:11,860 --> 00:11:12,500
Yeah.

263
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:14,100
That's not my fault.

264
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:14,660
Yeah, I know.

265
00:11:14,660 --> 00:11:15,860
There's nothing wrong with it.

266
00:11:15,860 --> 00:11:16,360
It's good.

267
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:17,020
It's horrible.

268
00:11:17,020 --> 00:11:17,660
First is the--

269
00:11:17,660 --> 00:11:18,340
Why is that bad?

270
00:11:18,340 --> 00:11:18,620
First is the burst.

271
00:11:18,620 --> 00:11:20,340
I have to bare my soul for everybody.

272
00:11:20,340 --> 00:11:21,420
First is the burst.

273
00:11:21,420 --> 00:11:21,940
And then--

274
00:11:21,940 --> 00:11:22,500
Second is the--

275
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:24,100
See, you just said first is the burst.

276
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:26,100
You know what we call that in stand up?

277
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:26,860
Call it a bullet.

278
00:11:26,860 --> 00:11:27,380
Exactly.

279
00:11:27,380 --> 00:11:28,380
A bullet.

280
00:11:28,380 --> 00:11:29,900
A bullet is scary.

281
00:11:29,900 --> 00:11:30,460
Yeah.

282
00:11:30,460 --> 00:11:32,020
And mine's not good.

283
00:11:32,020 --> 00:11:33,420
Where did I put my phone?

284
00:11:33,420 --> 00:11:36,420
Uh oh. Whoa. Mr. Unprepared.

285
00:11:36,420 --> 00:11:39,620
No, it was right here. It blended in with a black wire.

286
00:11:39,620 --> 00:11:41,620
Damn, that's gotta suck.

287
00:11:41,620 --> 00:11:42,620
It's pretty embarrassing.

288
00:11:42,620 --> 00:11:44,020
I can't even imagine what that's like.

289
00:11:44,020 --> 00:11:47,420
So, mine...

290
00:11:47,420 --> 00:11:48,520
You said "mime"?

291
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:51,020
Mine...

292
00:11:51,020 --> 00:11:52,120
Why would I say "mime"?

293
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:54,120
A mime can't sing, dumbass.

294
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:56,620
Mine is...

295
00:11:56,620 --> 00:11:59,120
First of all, it's called...

296
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:02,620
It's a satire for part of it.

297
00:12:02,620 --> 00:12:03,460
It's called...

298
00:12:03,460 --> 00:12:05,720
Part of it is satire, but the rest is true.

299
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:07,860
You'll just... You'll take it as it comes.

300
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:09,100
I'll say... I'll put it that way.

301
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:11,940
But it's called The Problem with Christmas Lists Nowadays.

302
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:15,700
And it... I took the tune...

303
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:18,300
I took the tune... And the tune might sound familiar,

304
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:22,380
but I changed everything about the lyrics and the message of the song.

305
00:12:22,380 --> 00:12:24,140
I just took the tune... A classic Christmas tune.

306
00:12:24,140 --> 00:12:26,540
Because I felt that would make it easier for me to sing it.

307
00:12:26,540 --> 00:12:28,180
But I changed everything about it.

308
00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:31,740
And it's about... It's called The Problem with Christmas Lists Nowadays.

309
00:12:31,740 --> 00:12:36,620
What's that song it's the tune of I think you'll hear it when I sing it. That's a really fair point

310
00:12:36,620 --> 00:12:39,380
Can you play the I think I'll sing the Christmas?

311
00:12:39,380 --> 00:12:45,180
Why you first get on this shit? I first you make me go first second you ruin my life

312
00:12:45,180 --> 00:12:51,020
That's a Christmas list right there. Yep. This is the problem with Christmas lists nowadays

313
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:53,140
and

314
00:12:53,140 --> 00:12:55,780
It's where you going he hates your song

315
00:12:55,780 --> 00:12:58,660
He hates your song so much

316
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:04,340
I just had to change the camera angle. What if that made it worse? Okay, okay here we go.

317
00:13:04,340 --> 00:13:08,420
All right, okay. I'm gonna sing it now. This is my carol, so imagine being sang this at a door.

318
00:13:08,420 --> 00:13:12,700
Your door. Well you gotta knock first buddy. You can't just sing it at my damn door.

319
00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:16,140

327
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:04,980
there and you'd see some big ring that was wrapped up and he thought maybe

328
00:14:04,980 --> 00:14:09,060

344
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:19,960
Alright well never mind then. I don't want okay. This kind of Pat. I thought he meant me.

345
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:23,000
I'm not gonna say I don't like getting Pat. I'll actually go by Patrick because I have a cousin who has the same name.

346
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:29,000
What about a Pat from Pat? Yeah that's fine. It's not really doing that much. Me I want a hula hoop.

347
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:34,320
I can get you a hula hoop. It's not that crazy. For real? Yeah probably a nice wooden artisan one too.

348
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:40,520
Made in Africa. A Brooklyn one? Yeah what? A Brooklyn style hula hoop? I can get you a Brooklyn style one.

A craft hula hoop?

Damn, an artisan hula hoop for my best friend.

351
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:44,840
I'll get you an artisan hula hoop.

352
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:47,960
The thing about me, I would love that, but I'd also be happy with any old thing that

353
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:49,320
costs one cent or less.

354
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:49,880
Yeah.

355
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:53,160
Nowadays people are like, "I want an iPad, I want an iPhone, I want an iPod."

356
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:55,400
Meanwhile, I'm like, "I paid."

357
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:55,640
Yeah.

358
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:56,760

399
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:08,160
and you were like, and then you're gonna rank the races. Yeah. That was not my idea. You

400
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:11,720
did say that. You said we could. We were like, we wanna do it but we don't want it to be

401
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:15,200
racist and you're like you guys should rank the races from one to one thousand

402
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:18,440
and we're like Pat one thousand yeah there's a thousand races you think we're

403
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:22,040
gonna get one thousand races on our you got me pretty racist to think there's a

404
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:34,120
thousand races you're making some subdivisions that are yeah you're doing

405
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:40,600
some a-1 you're like dividing up like different types of Irish people yeah

406
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:42,040
- Yeah, that's bad. - That's unhealthy.

407
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:46,160
- Yeah, I would say there's four.

408
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:48,040
- There's four races.

409
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:48,880
- I don't know.

410
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:50,160
- I don't think there's any number you can say

411
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:51,760
that's not a bad number to say.

412
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:52,600
- There's zero.

413
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:53,880
- There's one race. - Besides one.

414
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:54,960
One is okay to say.

415
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:56,560
- There's one. - There's one race.

416
00:19:56,560 --> 00:19:57,400
- White people.

417
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:59,400
- No.

418
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:01,160
- No, no, no, no.

419
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:03,320
- The other ones.

420
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:04,800
- Pangean.

421
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:06,200
- What? - We're all Pangean.

422
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:07,200
- I thought you said Indian.

423
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:08,040
- Nope.

424
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:08,880
(laughing)

425
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:10,160
- I was like, whoa.

426
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:11,240
- Okay, there's two races.

427
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:12,080
- That would be funny to--

428
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:13,880
- The human race and the Arcturans.

429
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:15,520
- It would be funny to do that,

430
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:19,160
like we're all one race, the Pangean race.

431
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:21,160
Or like, there's only two races,

432
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:25,840
Pangean and those friggin' Italians.

433
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:26,960
- Mm, that'd be awesome.

434
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:29,120
- Yeah, I don't like, I don't,

435
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:32,280
typically I find it funny to make fun of the Italians.

436
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:33,840
- You know what, speaking of fuckin'--

437
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:36,240
- It's funny to make fun of Italians for me again.

438
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:37,080
- Speaking of--

439
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:39,920
- I know, it's overdone. - I like the pizza.

440
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:42,520
It's overdone, but you know, it's funny to me again.

441
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:44,760
- Man, speaking of fucking awful.

442
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:46,000
- These are the races.

443
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,240
- These are the race, oh, this is a pretty,

444
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:49,800
this is a pretty comprehensive list.

445
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:51,200
- Yeah, this is all the races.

446
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:53,240
This is why I want you guys to do 23B.

447
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:55,960
- Kobold, Lougherin, Leprechaun, Miri Lanikode.

448
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:59,160
- I would say there's a strong possibility

449
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:02,760
that I'm part Sawakadam, Sawookadam.

450
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:04,360
- Or Skullsworn.

451
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:08,720
- Oh, I always thought I'd been Doomfallen or Bicknill.

452
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:10,280
I thought it said bikini.

453
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:11,560
- Me too. - Could be.

454
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:13,000
Listen up. - Bikini killers.

455
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:17,320
- Speaking of fucking awful racist awfulness,

456
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:18,480
and stop ranking them.

457
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:20,640
He ranked human as S tier.

458
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:21,840
- Yeah, for shit.

459
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:23,080
- Yeah.

460
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:26,440
Listen, I'm sure you guys have seen all this news

461
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:29,280
about Kanye West, right?

462
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:32,040
So I thought it was about high time.

463
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:34,040
I didn't do a Christmas carol, I'm gonna be real with you.

464
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:35,040
- You did a holiday carol?

465
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:36,880
- I did myself a holiday poem

466
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:39,380
that attacks violently Kanye West

467
00:21:39,380 --> 00:21:41,120
for his horrible new beliefs.

468
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:42,340
And I thought it was about high time

469
00:21:42,340 --> 00:21:44,020
that somebody takes him to task.

470
00:21:44,020 --> 00:21:46,760
So I'd like to take him to task right here and right now.

471
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:48,840
And if you notice while I'm reading this,

472
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:51,480
I actually used pieces of what he's written

473
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:53,560
to attack himself like a mirror.

474
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:56,040
'Cause that's something that he should be looking at.

475
00:21:56,040 --> 00:21:57,640
It's called Kanye Poem.

476
00:21:57,640 --> 00:22:00,640
Kanye, you used to be a champion,

477
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:04,480
but I've become so appalled by your anti-Semitic remarks.

478
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:08,260
As an ally, now I see you in my nightmares.

479
00:22:08,260 --> 00:22:10,980
I used to love your music, but now if I hear your music,

480
00:22:10,980 --> 00:22:13,120
I run away from it.

481
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:16,240
When I saw your tweet, I thought about killing you.

482
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:18,480
(laughing)

483
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:24,960
Your music is gorgeous, but you are so heartless.

484
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:27,440
You're playing the blame game with the Jewish people,

485
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:29,240
you monster.

486
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:31,680
You used to be my amazing big brother.

487
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:32,840
(laughing)

488
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:37,840
But now I will throw you up until you touch the sky.

489
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:41,980
I will use my ultralight beam to destroy you

490
00:22:41,980 --> 00:22:44,840
and I will take a shit on your white dress.

491
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:47,120
I want to kill you with waves

492
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:52,120
and if I see you in Paris, it's on sight

493
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:55,000
'cause I'm bound to kick your ass.

494
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,500
- Damn. - Wow.

495
00:22:57,500 --> 00:22:59,960
- You saw something about Paris?

496
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:02,260
- I was like, I see you in Paris.

497
00:23:02,260 --> 00:23:06,360
So what's like just if I see you in Paris, I don't know what was that a song name.

498
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:09,960
No. No, I was just talking about if I maybe see him around in Paris could be it.

499
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:12,260
Okay for him because I'm going to kill him on site.

500
00:23:12,260 --> 00:23:13,460
I'm bound to do that.

501
00:23:13,460 --> 00:23:16,860
Okay. Okay.

502
00:23:16,860 --> 00:23:18,360
Well that wasn't really holiday.

503
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:19,960
That's more kind of way.

504
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:21,860
I guess your Santa costume kind of hold on.

505
00:23:21,860 --> 00:23:22,660
No, no, no, no.

506
00:23:22,660 --> 00:23:23,460
Hold on.

507
00:23:23,460 --> 00:23:26,460
You have another and you're not invited to this Christmas in Harlem.

508
00:23:26,460 --> 00:23:27,860
Okay.

509
00:23:27,860 --> 00:23:28,860
Yeah, there we go.

510
00:23:28,860 --> 00:23:31,760
Rounding it out with another Christmas.

511
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:33,760
Christmas

512
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:36,640
All of the

513
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:40,740
Pretty good and celebrate the eight nights or the eight lights

514
00:23:40,740 --> 00:23:45,240
The eight crazy nights that he make a song called eight crazy nights

515
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:50,960
He's probably we got all the lights and all the lights in her. He needs to see we need to show me if he sees

516
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:56,760
If I think if Kanye sees Adam Sandler, he'll all that anti-semitism is gonna go probably doesn't realize it

517
00:23:56,760 --> 00:23:59,000
He's probably never seen Adam Sandler.

518
00:23:59,000 --> 00:23:59,500
Yeah.

519
00:23:59,500 --> 00:24:01,500
That's probably his big thing.

520
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:02,880
He needs to see The Cobbler.

521
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:03,880
The Cobbler.

522
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:05,460
That could change the world.

523
00:24:05,460 --> 00:24:06,460
Yeah, you know what?

524
00:24:06,460 --> 00:24:09,460
If I see him turn into The Gobbler, I'll eat him.

525
00:24:09,460 --> 00:24:10,640
You're going to eat Kanye West?

526
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:11,140
Yep.

527
00:24:11,140 --> 00:24:13,640
Kanye needs to go to that Cobbler from that movie,

528
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:16,060
and he needs to try on a Jewish man's shoes.

529
00:24:16,060 --> 00:24:16,560
That's true.

530
00:24:16,560 --> 00:24:18,600
And say, Kanye, your shoes are ridiculous.

531
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:21,060
They look like foam blocks, these shoes you're making.

532
00:24:21,060 --> 00:24:23,140
So maybe you do need to take a trip to The Cobbler.

533
00:24:23,140 --> 00:24:23,640
Yep.

534
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:25,760
And if I see your shoes, I'm going to become The Gobbler.

535
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:26,760
What if I eat your shoes?

536
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:27,760
Stop eating stuff.

537
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:28,760
I'm gonna eat your toes!

538
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:32,400
Yeah, and if I see anybody else I might be the gobbler too.

539
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:33,840
Then you're not the gobbler, man.

540
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:34,840
Shut the fuck up.

541
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:36,460
I'm the gobbler.

542
00:24:36,460 --> 00:24:38,400
You can't eat shoes and people, man.

543
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:39,400
Shut the hell up.

544
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:40,400
You can eat shoes.

545
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:41,400
Fuck you, you can eat shoes.

546
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:42,400
Shut the fuck up.

547
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:45,400
There's a man who ate a shoe.

548
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:46,400
Yeah, cut up the rubber.

549
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:47,400
No.

550
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:48,400
Yeah, exactly.

551
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:50,920
It was your mom and nine months later you popped out.

552
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:51,920
Yeah.

553
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:54,080
My mom ate a shoe and I thought that was funny.

554
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:55,360
You're a fucking shoe turd.

555
00:24:55,360 --> 00:25:01,800
Yeah, my name is gonna be aglet the hell are you taught? I'll understand your fucking shoe jokes. He's doing he's doing shoe humor

556
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:05,640
Yeah, I understood it though cuz I know a lot about shoes cuz I'm getting ready to eat one

557
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:18,880
And now I'm going on the aglet then I will slurp the rest of the lace like it's a spaghetti string

558
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:23,880
I think that I'm David Lynch when I'm doing it. Mm-hmm. I'm eating my own shoe

559
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:26,960
- That was good. - Gordon, I'm eating my shoe!

560
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:28,600
- Yeah, I would say Kanye though,

561
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:30,800
'cause Kanye would be in my room when I was doing it.

562
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:31,920
- Why would he be in your room? - And it would be his shoe.

563
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:32,840
- 'Cause I'm eating his shoe.

564
00:25:32,840 --> 00:25:36,680
- You're eating a Yeezy, you're eating a Yeezy One,

565
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:38,600
a Nike Yeezy. - One calorie.

566
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:40,920
- Yeah, Red October, you're eating a Red October.

567
00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:42,320
- How many calories are in a shoe?

568
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:44,120
- One, I looked it up.

569
00:25:44,120 --> 00:25:44,960
- How many calories are in a shoe?

570
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:46,520
- How many calories are in a shoe?

571
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:48,320
- That's a good question, man.

572
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:50,440
But yeah, that's my Christmas, or my Hanukkah.

573
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:52,240
- In a show. - In a show.

574
00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:55,080
A person weighs 180 pounds.

575
00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:57,080
He's cooking calories.

576
00:25:57,080 --> 00:25:59,080
454.

577
00:25:59,080 --> 00:26:01,080
Show it.

578
00:26:01,080 --> 00:26:03,080
454.

579
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:05,080
We're not going to read all that junk up top.

580
00:26:05,080 --> 00:26:07,080
It depends on the shoe because some shoes have leather

581
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:09,080
and suede and some shoes have canvas.

582
00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:11,080
Calories and sneaker. Right there.

583
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:13,080
170.

584
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:15,080
Sneaker chocolate fun size.

585
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:17,080
Ignore the second part.

586
00:26:17,080 --> 00:26:19,080
That's about the color of this shoe.

587
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:21,080
It's a color way.

588
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:25,340
makes sense. I was really pissed off because I went to the store and I was

589
00:26:25,340 --> 00:26:27,660
looking for a snack and I thought I bought chocolate covered pretzels. I

590
00:26:27,660 --> 00:26:29,080
just bought chocolate colored pretzels.

591
00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:36,280
I was actually really there's a Juvia had a reddit thing pulled up of like how

592
00:26:36,280 --> 00:26:40,920
many calories were in a shoe or somebody asking the nutritional value of a shoe

593
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:46,560
and the only check this woman's book. Yeah. What is this woman's book? I want

594
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:49,680
to somebody wrote a book about eating a shoe. This is not a book. This is a

595
00:26:49,700 --> 00:26:51,080
This is an onion video.

596
00:26:51,080 --> 00:26:52,300
Oh, it's an onion video.

597
00:26:52,300 --> 00:26:53,300
Oh, great.

598
00:26:53,300 --> 00:26:53,700
Okay.

599
00:26:53,700 --> 00:26:54,900
We fucking ate the onion.

600
00:26:54,900 --> 00:26:56,900
And somebody said go to bed,

601
00:26:56,900 --> 00:26:59,900
but it's better than starving.

602
00:26:59,900 --> 00:27:02,300
There is absolutely no nutritional value in a shoe.

603
00:27:02,300 --> 00:27:03,300
Yeah.

604
00:27:03,300 --> 00:27:03,500
Yeah.

605
00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:03,700
Yeah.

606
00:27:03,700 --> 00:27:03,900
Yeah.

607
00:27:03,900 --> 00:27:05,600
That's what I was thinking.

608
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:06,700
Go on Reddit.

609
00:27:06,700 --> 00:27:07,200
That's what I was thinking.

610
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:10,600
If the upper is made entirely of leather or like leather suede, I

611
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:15,200
feel like that you could probably sustain, you could probably live

612
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:15,400
off that for like an hour.

613
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:17,700
So now go on Reddit and do TIL.

614
00:27:17,700 --> 00:27:19,980
there is no nutritional value in a shoe.

615
00:27:19,980 --> 00:27:21,420
And just post that while we're talking,

616
00:27:21,420 --> 00:27:22,500
and you don't have to show up,

617
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:24,100
but just get that out there for everybody.

618
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:26,980
- And then a link to the post.

619
00:27:26,980 --> 00:27:28,540
- We've seen it, it's a thing, you know,

620
00:27:28,540 --> 00:27:30,540
people need information, the internet.

621
00:27:30,540 --> 00:27:32,060
- And we're here to get it. - It's collapsing.

622
00:27:32,060 --> 00:27:32,900
Have you heard about this?

623
00:27:32,900 --> 00:27:35,900
Apparently Google search is totally ruined.

624
00:27:35,900 --> 00:27:36,980
- What? - Really?

625
00:27:36,980 --> 00:27:37,820
- What are you talking about?

626
00:27:37,820 --> 00:27:41,780
- I guess AI has caused Google search

627
00:27:41,780 --> 00:27:44,500
to become less useful, apparently.

628
00:27:44,500 --> 00:27:45,340
- That's my reaction to that.

629
00:27:45,340 --> 00:27:47,020
- Are you talking about that to me?

630
00:27:47,020 --> 00:27:51,260
Yeah, but we don't have to talk about that because that's just depressing as fuck.

631
00:27:51,260 --> 00:27:52,260
I hate depressing news.

632
00:27:52,260 --> 00:27:53,260
Do you see how depressed I am?

633
00:27:53,260 --> 00:27:54,260
Yeah, you're stroking hell.

634
00:27:54,260 --> 00:27:56,940
You look hella fucking ugly.

635
00:27:56,940 --> 00:27:58,820
You look so fucking ugly.

636
00:27:58,820 --> 00:28:00,380
Holy shit.

637
00:28:00,380 --> 00:28:01,620
You look ugly as a motherfucker.

638
00:28:01,620 --> 00:28:03,820
How did you get your face to get that big?

639
00:28:03,820 --> 00:28:06,620
Do you want to see a time I looked really pretty the other day?

640
00:28:06,620 --> 00:28:07,620
Don't.

641
00:28:07,620 --> 00:28:08,620
No.

642
00:28:08,620 --> 00:28:09,620
I do.

643
00:28:09,620 --> 00:28:10,620
I don't know.

644
00:28:10,620 --> 00:28:11,620
I need to see it.

645
00:28:11,620 --> 00:28:14,100
I looked so pretty when I was sitting in my room and I couldn't help but take a picture.

646
00:28:14,100 --> 00:28:15,580
I said this to Patrick already.

647
00:28:15,580 --> 00:28:16,580
Yeah.

648
00:28:16,580 --> 00:28:17,580
I really wanted him to see that.

649
00:28:17,580 --> 00:28:18,580
Oh my god, you look so beautiful.

650
00:28:18,580 --> 00:28:19,580
Show the camera.

651
00:28:19,580 --> 00:28:20,580
Put that up to the camera.

652
00:28:20,580 --> 00:28:22,820
Holy, you're a fucking gorgeous guy.

653
00:28:22,820 --> 00:28:23,820
You think I looked good?

654
00:28:23,820 --> 00:28:25,820
You look like, uh, you seen Zoolander?

655
00:28:25,820 --> 00:28:28,860
Did you just try to...

656
00:28:28,860 --> 00:28:30,060
That's a handsome one as well.

657
00:28:30,060 --> 00:28:31,060
Show that to the camera.

658
00:28:31,060 --> 00:28:32,060
I didn't go camera left.

659
00:28:32,060 --> 00:28:33,060
Wow.

660
00:28:33,060 --> 00:28:34,060
I went, er...

661
00:28:34,060 --> 00:28:35,060
See, yeah.

662
00:28:35,060 --> 00:28:36,060
I stole a kiss.

663
00:28:36,060 --> 00:28:37,060
Ohoho!

664
00:28:37,060 --> 00:28:38,060
Santa should not steal, Santa should give.

665
00:28:38,060 --> 00:28:39,060
I'll steal.

666
00:28:39,060 --> 00:28:41,500
I gave a kiss to your bitch ass for Christmas.

667
00:28:41,500 --> 00:28:48,780
What I was saying is, that's grounds for divorce if I get a vacuum for Christmas, I think.

668
00:28:48,780 --> 00:28:51,020
That's gotta be fucked up, right?

669
00:28:51,020 --> 00:28:52,020
I don't think so.

670
00:28:52,020 --> 00:28:53,100
That's what happens, dude.

671
00:28:53,100 --> 00:28:54,220
It's fucked.

672
00:28:54,220 --> 00:28:56,220
I just don't want to become that kind of person.

673
00:28:56,220 --> 00:28:57,860
That's why you have to leave America.

674
00:28:57,860 --> 00:28:58,860
I do.

675
00:28:58,860 --> 00:28:59,860
I need to go to Italy.

676
00:28:59,860 --> 00:29:01,500
That's why people go to Canada.

677
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:06,500
I need to go to Italy and get, like, Godfather, get an Italian wife instead.

678
00:29:06,500 --> 00:29:10,220
Doesn't speak any English, has an IQ of like 60.

679
00:29:10,220 --> 00:29:12,660
All she knows how to do is wear a big white frilly shirt

680
00:29:12,660 --> 00:29:13,820
and make you spaghetti.

681
00:29:13,820 --> 00:29:14,620
Yep.

682
00:29:14,620 --> 00:29:15,420
Pasta-gi-lio.

683
00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:17,460
Pasta-gi-lio.

684
00:29:17,460 --> 00:29:20,900
People in Italy, they live in castles.

685
00:29:20,900 --> 00:29:21,420
Yeah.

686
00:29:21,420 --> 00:29:23,700
They basically are in a painting world.

687
00:29:23,700 --> 00:29:25,500
You can also, instead of going to Italy,

688
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:27,740
you could just move to New Jersey.

689
00:29:27,740 --> 00:29:28,860
Yeah, it's the same shit.

690
00:29:28,860 --> 00:29:29,740
It's the same thing.

691
00:29:29,740 --> 00:29:30,940
They have castles there too.

692
00:29:30,940 --> 00:29:32,740
South Jersey, maybe, or North Jersey.

693
00:29:32,740 --> 00:29:34,100
All the same fat guys and women.

694
00:29:34,100 --> 00:29:36,460
You could go to fucking--

695
00:29:36,460 --> 00:29:39,020
Italy, though, does not have Atlantic City.

696
00:29:39,020 --> 00:29:39,580
Yeah.

697
00:29:39,580 --> 00:29:40,180

- Hope it doesn't have Unicron, the evil transformer.

704
00:30:11,820 --> 00:30:15,340
- Oh my God, I just understood what Uniclo is short for.

705
00:30:15,340 --> 00:30:16,180
- What?

706
00:30:16,180 --> 00:30:17,380
- Unique clothes.

707
00:30:17,380 --> 00:30:18,220
(laughing)

708
00:30:18,220 --> 00:30:19,760
- Oh my God, you're right.

709
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:21,740
- That is so fucking true.

710
00:30:21,740 --> 00:30:23,540
- I never realized that.

711
00:30:23,540 --> 00:30:24,740
- They are pretty fucking unique.

712
00:30:24,740 --> 00:30:25,980
- I thought it was a made up word.

713
00:30:25,980 --> 00:30:27,700
- Long sleeve shirts, long sleeve pants.

714
00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:28,860
- Heat tech.

715
00:30:28,860 --> 00:30:29,700
- Yep.

716
00:30:29,700 --> 00:30:30,860
- Uniclo heat tech.

717
00:30:30,860 --> 00:30:33,660
- Wait, heat tech stands for--

718
00:30:33,660 --> 00:30:35,140
- Heat technology.

719
00:30:35,140 --> 00:30:37,260
- Yeah, heat technology.

720
00:30:37,260 --> 00:30:38,460
It's for guys only.

721
00:30:38,460 --> 00:30:45,720
Yeah, yeah, I gotta go to Uniqlo. That's a whole you never been to Uniqlo in my life really. Yeah, it's basically for

722
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:50,720
It's only for skinny minis, so I don't go there. No they got fat guy clothes there now for Rizzle

723
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:55,660
Uh-huh might have to check it out. Yeah, they have medium guy stuff. They got medium guy stuff

724
00:30:55,660 --> 00:31:01,940
They have pretty much everything there. It's kind of like doesn't sound so unique. It's kind of like Primark, but if it was good

725
00:31:01,940 --> 00:31:07,320
Okay, got him. Yeah, fuck you Primark. Fuck you Primark

726
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:10,660
Stop by stop let my mom buy my Christmas gifts wait

727
00:31:10,660 --> 00:31:16,560
I just realized something what uniclo is like unicron and primark is like optimus prime

728
00:31:16,560 --> 00:31:22,860
Because of the names my god because you transform when you put on a new pair of clothes into a new handsome dapper, man

729
00:31:22,860 --> 00:31:25,860
Yeah, or a car put on a car costume

730
00:31:25,860 --> 00:31:29,440
They might have car costumes a unit clothes

731
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:34,780
They got all the clothes. I don't know because I've been there is this the it's this the what's his name?

732
00:31:34,780 --> 00:31:41,820
Oh, yeah, big sartorialist. I love this guy. Yeah, go. Oh, he's just not it just happens. Oh, wow good for him. Yeah

733
00:31:41,820 --> 00:31:47,340
Damn, it's like the big the fat sartorialist. Okay. I have an idea

734
00:31:47,340 --> 00:31:56,700
No, what do you think oh I can't read I didn't bring my glasses I

735
00:31:56,700 --> 00:32:02,740
Have an idea for a thing that I was thinking about a few days ago that I think you guys could help me develop

736
00:32:02,740 --> 00:32:04,300
Okay

737
00:32:04,300 --> 00:32:06,300
So it will be a thing in a grocery store

738
00:32:06,300 --> 00:32:08,860
Okay, I'm already so hang it up here

739
00:32:08,860 --> 00:32:11,620
rotisserie candy

740
00:32:11,620 --> 00:32:16,300
Holy shit, so here's my first pitch, and I want you guys to help me nut. Here's my

741
00:32:16,300 --> 00:32:18,860
Made me come here's my early early

742
00:32:18,860 --> 00:32:24,340
I need help developing so that we can maybe take it on shark tank or something, but you know a rotisserie chicken

743
00:32:24,340 --> 00:32:28,140
It's hot in there rotisserie candy. It's chocolate bars, and it's cold oh

744
00:32:28,140 --> 00:32:33,220
It's not melted whoa. It's true. It's a bar, and you can break you can take off a ball

745
00:32:33,220 --> 00:32:35,940
So it's like the 7-Eleven rollers but they're cold.

746
00:32:35,940 --> 00:32:39,940
Yeah, but it's not a road kissery. It's not rolling on, it's on a spit.

747
00:32:39,940 --> 00:32:45,240
How would you do that with, I guess, you know, and then you could stack Reese's up and shave

748
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:48,100
them like it's like shawarma.

749
00:32:48,100 --> 00:32:54,060
That's a really good idea. Holy shit. That is fucking genius. A bunch of giant, those

750
00:32:54,060 --> 00:32:56,620
giant Reese's on a big stick.

751
00:32:56,620 --> 00:32:58,980
Trust me, when it comes to candy, I have some great ideas.

752
00:32:58,980 --> 00:33:00,180
What do you shave it onto?

753
00:33:00,180 --> 00:33:01,380
Maybe, also, now I'm thinking.

754
00:33:01,380 --> 00:33:02,380
Ice cream.

755
00:33:02,380 --> 00:33:06,440
It's the idea is not rotisserie candy rolled ice cream dude rolled ice cream amazing

756
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:10,560
Maybe it's just a full rotisserie store and everything is on a rotisserie

757
00:33:10,560 --> 00:33:17,640
And it's all fresh you call it spits spits is so good. Yeah, and the logo spins

758
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:24,380
Well, then you would call it spins. No because it spins spits it spits spinning spits

759
00:33:24,380 --> 00:33:31,100
But it's a terrible spits with an apostrophe as if there's it's a belongs to a guy named spit. Yeah. Oh, that's good

760
00:33:31,660 --> 00:33:34,660
When I think of food, I love to think of spits.

761
00:33:34,660 --> 00:33:35,660
Yeah, saliva.

762
00:33:35,660 --> 00:33:36,660
Spits foods.

763
00:33:36,660 --> 00:33:37,660
Mouthwatering.

764
00:33:37,660 --> 00:33:39,660
It can be called spits spinning foods.

765
00:33:39,660 --> 00:33:40,660
Yeah.

766
00:33:40,660 --> 00:33:41,660
What else would you eat at spits?

767
00:33:41,660 --> 00:33:42,660
Cereal.

768
00:33:42,660 --> 00:33:43,660
Shawarma.

769
00:33:43,660 --> 00:33:44,660
Oh, there would be shawarma.

770
00:33:44,660 --> 00:33:45,660
How is cereal?

771
00:33:45,660 --> 00:33:46,660
Pickles.

772
00:33:46,660 --> 00:33:47,660
It's spinning.

773
00:33:47,660 --> 00:33:48,660
What did you say?

774
00:33:48,660 --> 00:33:49,660
Pickles.

775
00:33:49,660 --> 00:33:50,660
Pickles is a good idea.

776
00:33:50,660 --> 00:33:51,660
You can slice off some deli cheese.

777
00:33:51,660 --> 00:33:56,660
You know when you have the cereal at a hotel breakfast when it's in a big container?

778
00:33:56,660 --> 00:33:59,660
It's like that, but it's spinning, so it separates out.

779
00:33:59,660 --> 00:34:02,940
it's like a centrifuge. It separates out, say, the lucky charms from the

780
00:34:02,940 --> 00:34:09,380
cardboard parts of it, the non marshmallows, and you could have it separate

781
00:34:09,380 --> 00:34:11,020
'cause it's spinning. So it's like one...

782
00:34:11,020 --> 00:34:14,300
Yeah, okay, I see what you're saying now. It spins really fast.

783
00:34:14,300 --> 00:34:18,500
Okay. Danger. That's the other thing, you can control the speed that it's

784
00:34:18,500 --> 00:34:23,340
spinning. Up to... It has a type of credit, like a touch toon credit,

785
00:34:23,340 --> 00:34:27,020
where you can... Oh, and there's a touch toon in the store. You have an

786
00:34:27,020 --> 00:34:31,620
app where you can control any item, you can speed up or slow down how it's spinning. So

787
00:34:31,620 --> 00:34:36,100
if you see someone you don't like about to get some spinning food, you speed it up really

788
00:34:36,100 --> 00:34:37,100
fast.

789
00:34:37,100 --> 00:34:39,180
Yeah, then it's impossible pretty much.

790
00:34:39,180 --> 00:34:41,260
You can pay to spin.

791
00:34:41,260 --> 00:34:42,820
Pay to spin to win.

792
00:34:42,820 --> 00:34:45,900
Here's what my counterpoint was to the vacuum. There's this place Jack--

793
00:34:45,900 --> 00:34:47,700
He's on about this so much.

794
00:34:47,700 --> 00:34:51,020
Listen, I had a-- okay, how much is a vacuum? Like a nice vacuum, like $150?

795
00:34:51,020 --> 00:34:52,020
No.

796
00:34:52,020 --> 00:34:53,020
Like a nice one?

797
00:34:53,020 --> 00:34:54,020
A nice vacuum, like $300.

798
00:34:54,020 --> 00:34:55,020
Okay, so even better.

799
00:34:55,020 --> 00:34:56,020
$7,000.

800
00:34:56,020 --> 00:35:00,700
I was saying for double for 300 bucks Jackson barbecue in Texas you can have

801
00:35:00,700 --> 00:35:07,260
them ship you a brisket okay so that was

802
00:35:07,260 --> 00:35:13,500
that's to get the barbecue place we went to no no no that's Tyler no Jackson

803
00:35:13,500 --> 00:35:16,860
barbecue is like supposedly the best brisket in the world and it's $300

804
00:35:16,860 --> 00:35:20,080
they'll ship you a brisket it's an entire hundred bucks yeah they got a

805
00:35:20,080 --> 00:35:25,660
ship it and cook it and shit and then you come you reheat it in a pot so I

806
00:35:25,660 --> 00:35:28,300
I don't feel like that's as good as a vacuum

807
00:35:28,300 --> 00:35:35,520
Yeah, I think a vacuum spider. What are you guys on her side? Yeah, you guys love vacuums or no cleanliness or something

808
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:40,480
I've seen your house. You don't want her I need a new vacuum. I have two vacuums motherfucker. Yeah, you don't use them

809
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:44,460
Yeah, I do one of them. You can't vacuum shirts off. You know the other one is so bad

810
00:35:44,460 --> 00:35:47,580
No, I'm the good one no

811
00:35:47,580 --> 00:35:53,860
Mo keeps climbing up the he keeps climbing up the vacuum bag and where he's gonna break it. That's what I'm saying

812
00:35:53,860 --> 00:35:57,180
I'll take it off your hands. You should vacuum up that little fucker. Yeah. Yeah, I

813
00:35:57,180 --> 00:36:00,100
Need to teach him a lesson

814
00:36:00,100 --> 00:36:05,320
And a vacuum is probably like a nuclear weapon to a shrinked guy

815
00:36:05,320 --> 00:36:08,880
To a shrinker think about a dog when a dog

816
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:17,640
You know what he likes I thought that he would hate like loud noises, but I guess because he's a stray he grew up around them

817
00:36:17,640 --> 00:36:19,640
Just like a little head. Yeah

818
00:36:21,380 --> 00:36:25,940
Alive for like five days before you got him. No. Yeah. No he was he was yes

819
00:36:25,940 --> 00:36:30,020
I found him at like a month old you don't know that there's no way to age a cat

820
00:36:30,020 --> 00:36:41,480
He's obsessed with I have like a like a knockoff like Thera gun

821
00:36:41,480 --> 00:36:44,100
Like one of those like $20 like Amazon ones

822
00:36:44,100 --> 00:36:46,100
I was like using it before I went out to skate

823
00:36:46,100 --> 00:36:51,560
and he loves the thing moving back and forth so much that he ran up and grabbed

824
00:36:51,560 --> 00:36:56,360
the Thera-Gun like while I was on my knee and tried to like yank it away from me and

825
00:36:56,360 --> 00:37:02,040
it's like as he's doing it it's going like so he's just... Do you ever get scared

826
00:37:02,040 --> 00:37:05,540
owning a Thera-Gun that maybe you'll get pulled over by a police officer they'll

827
00:37:05,540 --> 00:37:09,980
say license registration and you'll say oh I just want you to know I have a

828
00:37:09,980 --> 00:37:14,380
Thera-Gun and they'll think you said there's a gun. I have I have a thousand

829
00:37:14,380 --> 00:37:23,060
guns. Yeah, that is that kind of scary having someone with a gun in their house? No, cause

830
00:37:23,060 --> 00:37:26,860
then... Just say no officer, I have a thousand guns in my house. Yeah, exactly, cause you'd

831
00:37:26,860 --> 00:37:29,020
say you wouldn't have it in the car, you'd be like, I just say no, I have a Thera-gun

832
00:37:29,020 --> 00:37:33,900
at home. Yeah. And it's thinking... I have a Thera-gun and then... I have a Very-gun.

833
00:37:33,900 --> 00:37:38,820
Yeah, the worst part about that is the cop... Adio! The cop is gonna try to like bad lieutenant

834
00:37:38,820 --> 00:37:43,460
me and make me give him a massage in the back of my car. Oh, true. Yeah. But then you, but

835
00:37:43,460 --> 00:37:50,460
then he thinks you said Theragun, you said I have a thousand guns, he turns his back to

836
00:37:50,460 --> 00:37:56,180
you and says "Well go ahead and give me a massage with that bad boy." And then I pull out my

837
00:37:56,180 --> 00:37:59,820
one thousand gun and I turn him into Swiss cheese. And there's no way, there's not a

838
00:37:59,820 --> 00:38:05,140
jury in the northern part of the United States that would ever convict you for that. Or he

839
00:38:05,140 --> 00:38:10,500
thinks you said a flare gun and he's like "Now I need you to signal, because I'm completely

840
00:38:10,500 --> 00:38:16,660
lost. I'm lost. This is not my jurisdiction at all. I'm in the wrong state. Yeah. I'm

841
00:38:16,660 --> 00:38:22,740
Ohio. I'm really scared and I need people to find me. It says Ottawa police. I'm a

We're like you're shaped like a samovar. Whoa a sandbar. You should be in the ocean motherfucker. Yeah

Well, what are you? What are you wearing?

862
00:40:03,860 --> 00:40:07,000
Your penis is still wearing this fucking Nigel Houston

863
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:12,320
I went to the gym. That's okay to see my penis

864
00:40:12,320 --> 00:40:16,300
How many times I've seen you wear these tights

865
00:40:16,300 --> 00:40:19,740
They're not tights and I'm them if I wanted to become a dancer

866
00:40:19,740 --> 00:40:21,900
I'd be honest with you guys and just fucking say that shit

867
00:40:21,900 --> 00:40:25,580
I wouldn't just start dressing like a dancer slowly and slowly start wearing to do

868
00:40:25,580 --> 00:40:32,780
Yeah, you're just like cancer aka the crab red. Yep, bro. I ripped my pants again. Yeah

869
00:40:32,780 --> 00:40:35,780
I guess I'm looking at your penis, it's showing to me.

870
00:40:35,780 --> 00:40:40,780
What the hell happened dude? Jesus Christ.

871
00:40:40,780 --> 00:40:42,780
Oh boy, yeah.

872
00:40:42,780 --> 00:40:44,780
So you still want to fuck me you motherfucker?

873
00:40:44,780 --> 00:40:50,780
I know you're really sad right now because your pants ripped, but maybe to get you in the Christmas spirit I'll...

874
00:40:50,780 --> 00:40:51,780
Smell these.

875
00:40:51,780 --> 00:40:52,780
I'm not...

876
00:40:52,780 --> 00:40:55,780
Actually, that smells good.

877
00:40:55,780 --> 00:40:57,780
That actually smells really good.

878
00:40:57,780 --> 00:40:59,780
Why is it blurry?

879
00:40:59,780 --> 00:41:04,780
It smelled good. It smelled good. That was something that was on my penis and my ass.

880
00:41:04,780 --> 00:41:07,780
And he said it smelled good. So all the ladies and guys out there.

881
00:41:07,780 --> 00:41:09,780
It smelled like laundry.

882
00:41:09,780 --> 00:41:11,780
It smelled like fucking small cock.

883
00:41:11,780 --> 00:41:13,780
It smelled like Brian Laundry.

884
00:41:13,780 --> 00:41:15,780
This is out on the ground. Smells like...

885
00:41:15,780 --> 00:41:18,780
Well I have my Christmas wrap.

886
00:41:18,780 --> 00:41:20,780
Nah, not today.

887
00:41:20,780 --> 00:41:29,660
today. Yeah, Gabby, whatever his name is, and Brian fucking Laundrie, let's bring that back.

888
00:41:29,660 --> 00:41:30,660
Yep.

889
00:41:30,660 --> 00:41:33,460
GBO, is there any way you can play that beat I sent you?

890
00:41:33,460 --> 00:41:35,780
It probably smells like a fish tank though right now.

891
00:41:35,780 --> 00:41:38,100
Probably a little bit like a fish tank.

892
00:41:38,100 --> 00:41:39,380
I sent you a beat.

893
00:41:39,380 --> 00:41:42,460
It's so romantic they...

894
00:41:42,460 --> 00:41:44,020
On the, over the phone.

895
00:41:44,020 --> 00:41:45,020
Oh.

896
00:41:45,020 --> 00:41:46,460
Don't just play it from your phone.

897
00:41:46,460 --> 00:41:50,020
I'll just play it over my phone.

898
00:41:50,020 --> 00:41:51,020
Why do you need a beat?

899
00:41:51,020 --> 00:41:52,020
Holy shit.

900
00:41:52,020 --> 00:41:53,020
That's a crutch.

901
00:41:53,020 --> 00:41:55,580
Yo, what up, bitch?

902
00:41:55,580 --> 00:41:56,940
My name is Santy Claus.

903
00:41:56,940 --> 00:41:59,780
I got a gift right here for your fat ass meemaw.

904
00:41:59,780 --> 00:42:01,940
I'm smoking weed and I'm drinking a 40.

905
00:42:01,940 --> 00:42:05,980
Now I show my dick to a crazy ass shorty.

906
00:42:05,980 --> 00:42:08,820
They turn my reindeer into ground beef.

907
00:42:08,820 --> 00:42:11,660
I whip my dick out in front of the police chief.

908
00:42:11,660 --> 00:42:14,060
You see me in your neighborhood, you know I got the present.

909
00:42:14,060 --> 00:42:16,780
I lost my two kids in the War of the Pheasant.

910
00:42:16,780 --> 00:42:18,900
That was a war in 1638.

911
00:42:18,900 --> 00:42:23,860
It was between pheasant and ape, when then human joined and it caused a lot of drama.

912
00:42:23,860 --> 00:42:26,300
It's the main cause of most of my trauma.

913
00:42:26,300 --> 00:42:28,820
The war was long and the battles were scary.

914
00:42:28,820 --> 00:42:30,980
Along with my kids I lost my best friend Harry.

915
00:42:30,980 --> 00:42:33,660
I saw a man degloved by a pheasant.

916
00:42:33,660 --> 00:42:36,240
Ah shit, that was so unpleasant.

917
00:42:36,240 --> 00:42:38,540
Then man won, alongside the ape.

918
00:42:38,540 --> 00:42:41,540
We took the pheasant king and squished him like a grape.

919
00:42:41,540 --> 00:42:47,380
Back in those days pheasants were huge, about the same size as me and yous.

920
00:42:47,380 --> 00:42:49,900
Then we ate the king and realized birds taste good.

921
00:42:49,900 --> 00:42:52,580
That's how poultry was introduced as food.

922
00:42:52,580 --> 00:42:57,260
During thousands of years we have eaten birds because of the war and laws and words.

923
00:42:57,260 --> 00:43:00,060
We all turned birds into food like beasts.

924
00:43:00,060 --> 00:43:02,400
Then apes unlearned how to speak.

925
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:04,620
And then humans ruled because of my power.

926
00:43:04,620 --> 00:43:07,500
I'm Santa Claus and I live in a tower.

927
00:43:07,500 --> 00:43:09,260
Is that it?

928
00:43:09,260 --> 00:43:10,780
Holy shit dude.

929
00:43:10,780 --> 00:43:11,780
Woah.

930
00:43:11,780 --> 00:43:14,460
Oh wait no I still have more.

931
00:43:14,460 --> 00:43:16,820
Anyways I'm Santa and I digress.

932
00:43:16,820 --> 00:43:19,440
i go to your mama's house and i make a mess

933
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:22,420
on a sexual freak and i have no man is a month

934
00:43:22,420 --> 00:43:26,620
dancing across your bad manager

935
00:43:26,620 --> 00:43:30,500
and that was great that i was going on that crazy i can't know you had that

936
00:43:30,500 --> 00:43:30,800
you're

937
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:34,680
what i want to do is is earlier when we're talking you said

938
00:43:34,680 --> 00:43:37,000
that we were talking about what you're

939
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:38,820
you said it was a war between

940
00:43:38,820 --> 00:43:40,500
apes and birds

941
00:43:40,500 --> 00:43:44,180
to remember that i remember talking about that for you and what we talked about

942
00:43:44,180 --> 00:43:46,240
- We talked about hypothetical situations

943
00:43:46,240 --> 00:43:47,340
in which animals would--

944
00:43:47,340 --> 00:43:49,060
- We talked about hypothetical situations?

945
00:43:49,060 --> 00:43:50,660
- No, we were talking about ducks and fighting horses.

946
00:43:50,660 --> 00:43:51,500
- Yeah, ducks and fighting horses.

947
00:43:51,500 --> 00:43:53,300
- That's not pheasants and birds.

948
00:43:53,300 --> 00:43:54,680
- Pheasants are birds.

949
00:43:54,680 --> 00:43:55,980
- Or pheasants and apes.

950
00:43:55,980 --> 00:43:56,820
Here's my question, man.

951
00:43:56,820 --> 00:43:57,660
- That was really, I really liked that, though.

952
00:43:57,660 --> 00:44:00,780
- Are you accusing Santa Claus of being a fucking monkey?

953
00:44:00,780 --> 00:44:05,020
- No, no, humans, joint, do you want me to say it again?

954
00:44:05,020 --> 00:44:06,500
- Yeah.

955
00:44:06,500 --> 00:44:07,860
- Yeah, it seems like you didn't retain the--

956
00:44:07,860 --> 00:44:09,780
- Yeah, no, I'm gonna need you to run that back.

957
00:44:09,780 --> 00:44:11,940
- And so apes could speak in 1638.

958
00:44:11,940 --> 00:44:14,140
- Yeah, so back, okay. - Maybe do a rock version now?

959
00:44:14,140 --> 00:44:17,140
All right. A rock version of this?

960
00:44:17,140 --> 00:44:19,860
Let me look up Aerosmith Run DMC type beat.

961
00:44:19,860 --> 00:44:22,060
Because that was just Run DMC type beat.

962
00:44:22,060 --> 00:44:24,620
I was kind of hoping there would be more Run DMC type beat.

963
00:44:24,620 --> 00:44:29,100
What kind of sad fucking kid is on Fruity Loops making Run DMC type beats?

964
00:44:29,100 --> 00:44:30,860
I wanted to read the...

965
00:44:30,860 --> 00:44:34,580
I wanted to read the comments to find freestyle.

966
00:44:34,580 --> 00:44:37,140
That's an old soul.

967
00:44:37,140 --> 00:44:40,020
The 12 year old. All his friends are rapping over Juice WRLD type beat.

968
00:44:40,020 --> 00:44:42,540
He's the one kid doing Run DMC.

969
00:44:42,540 --> 00:44:46,340
Free Traumatized Travis Barker x Aerosmith Type B C

970
00:44:46,340 --> 00:44:47,340
Oh yeah play that!

971
00:44:47,340 --> 00:44:48,340
I wanna hear that.

972
00:44:48,340 --> 00:44:49,340
Alright then I'll-

973
00:44:49,340 --> 00:44:50,340
Sounds lit.

974
00:44:50,340 --> 00:44:55,340
Classic jeans for little boy.

975
00:44:55,340 --> 00:44:58,820
These are fire.

976
00:44:58,820 --> 00:45:00,460
These are not that Aerosmithy to me though.

977
00:45:00,460 --> 00:45:01,460
These are just the intro.

978
00:45:01,460 --> 00:45:02,460
Oh holy shit.

979
00:45:02,460 --> 00:45:03,460
Okay.

980
00:45:03,460 --> 00:45:04,460
Alright.

981
00:45:04,460 --> 00:45:06,420
Now sing it.

982
00:45:06,420 --> 00:45:07,420
Don't rap it but sing it.

983
00:45:07,420 --> 00:45:09,900
Cause I can't understand that rap crap.

984
00:45:09,900 --> 00:45:10,900
Wait until it-

985
00:45:10,900 --> 00:45:15,620
It's got a YouTube premium. It's on the podcast YouTube. Oh.

986
00:45:15,620 --> 00:45:19,020
Okay, that is gonna drop.

987
00:45:19,020 --> 00:45:22,860

Holy shit. Yo what up bitch my name is Santy Claus. You're rapping again.

We have eaten birds because of the war and laws and words we turned all the birds into food like beasts and then apes

1011
00:46:47,760 --> 00:46:55,020
Unlearned how to speak then humans ruled because of my power. I'm Santa Claus and I live in a tower

1012
00:46:55,020 --> 00:47:00,860
Anyways, I'm Santa and I digress I go to your mama's house and I make a mess

1013
00:47:00,860 --> 00:47:07,180
I'm a sexual freak and I have no manners damn Santa Claus you a bad man my jamma

1014
00:47:07,180 --> 00:47:12,720
See it worked better as a rock song. Yeah, I honestly do believe that yeah

1015
00:47:12,720 --> 00:47:19,740
Wait the perhaps are the most important spots of the North Pole the clock tower is where Santa's sleigh departs for his Christmas Eve flight

1016
00:47:19,740 --> 00:47:23,540
Why would he not depart from like an airplane or a sleigh plane? I guess it makes more sense

1017
00:47:23,540 --> 00:47:25,060
Mm-hmm

1018
00:47:25,060 --> 00:47:30,840
Yeah, does Santa does Santa live in a tower because that's where the thing departs from so I don't know if he lives there

1019
00:47:30,840 --> 00:47:32,040
We'll get into it.

1020
00:47:32,040 --> 00:47:35,480
Listen, we have probably four or five or six more episodes

1021
00:47:35,480 --> 00:47:37,920
where we get to talk about Santa as much as we want.

1022
00:47:37,920 --> 00:47:40,600
I think we have four more Christmas episodes.

1023
00:47:40,600 --> 00:47:41,640
God damn it.

1024
00:47:41,640 --> 00:47:44,000
Would you guys be mad if I just wore a Santa suit

1025
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:46,760
for the rest of the podcast for years and years?

1026
00:47:46,760 --> 00:47:51,280
I feel like that would be kind of complicated.

1027
00:47:51,280 --> 00:47:52,120
Why?

1028
00:47:52,120 --> 00:47:54,400
You wanna be the Santa Claus guy?

1029
00:47:54,400 --> 00:47:56,040
The guy who wears the Santa Claus suit?

1030
00:47:56,040 --> 00:47:57,240
For a couple years.

1031
00:47:57,240 --> 00:47:59,680
That's the kid with the rolling backpack status.

1032
00:47:59,680 --> 00:48:01,680
No, it's not don't say sad

1033
00:48:01,680 --> 00:48:05,220
Reddit guy who is a bear hat? Yeah, what are you talking?

1034
00:48:05,220 --> 00:48:09,260
I don't know what he's talking about, but I agree all that you guys saying this you guys are now

1035
00:48:09,260 --> 00:48:13,140
Humbugs and you are doubting me. I think that I may become a

00:49:37,360 --> 00:49:40,660
Wait, what happened back back?

1054
00:49:40,660 --> 00:49:44,180

00:49:48,300 --> 00:49:52,660
it's makeup it's an emo makeup but he wasn't like that in the previous photo

00:50:06,900 --> 00:50:10,180
somebody wearing that yeah turn the computer that's enough computer for but I

1060
00:50:10,180 --> 00:50:14,980
did see somebody wearing the jacket from Guardians of the Galaxy on the trail

1061
00:50:14,980 --> 00:50:15,980
Oh, Jubio?

1062
00:50:15,980 --> 00:50:16,980
Oh, shit.

1063
00:50:16,980 --> 00:50:17,980
Yeah, it was Jubio.

1064
00:50:17,980 --> 00:50:18,980
Remember when Jubio was supposed to get that?

1065
00:50:18,980 --> 00:50:22,260
No, I didn't know that they were just straight up a cosplay jacket.

1066
00:50:22,260 --> 00:50:23,260
I didn't know they made that.

1067
00:50:23,260 --> 00:50:25,260
Yeah, dude, Jubio almost bought one.

1068
00:50:25,260 --> 00:50:27,380
Yeah, Jubio was supposed to get one.

1069
00:50:27,380 --> 00:50:28,980
How the hell did you recognize that jacket?

1070
00:50:28,980 --> 00:50:29,980
Because I've seen that movie.

1071
00:50:29,980 --> 00:50:30,980
Isn't it just a leather?

1072
00:50:30,980 --> 00:50:31,980
I wouldn't recognize that shit.

1073
00:50:31,980 --> 00:50:32,980
I would recognize it.

1074
00:50:32,980 --> 00:50:33,980
I would recognize it.

1075
00:50:33,980 --> 00:50:34,980
You know why?

1076
00:50:34,980 --> 00:50:35,980
It's a leather jacket, right?

1077
00:50:35,980 --> 00:50:36,980
You know why?

1078
00:50:36,980 --> 00:50:37,980
What?

1079
00:50:37,980 --> 00:50:38,980
Because I wanted Jubio to wear it.

1080
00:50:38,980 --> 00:50:39,980
No, it's like a red leather jacket that has a bunch of layers.

1081
00:50:39,980 --> 00:50:40,980
It doesn't look like a normal.

1082
00:50:40,980 --> 00:50:43,640
You can also tell that it's not a normal leather jacket

1083
00:50:43,640 --> 00:50:50,120
I thought like just just not just just not by but just by the quality of the item because it is a cosplay thing it clearly

1084
00:50:50,120 --> 00:50:55,620
Looks like it's yeah something is wrong. You know you know what I mean you see like the like it looks like a Halloween costume

1085
00:50:55,620 --> 00:50:59,220
Yeah, like it's like the fake plastic leather that looks like if you like yeah

1086
00:50:59,220 --> 00:51:01,380
I was a word for that pleather. Oh

1087
00:51:01,380 --> 00:51:04,340
You might be a genius you should be buck

1088
00:51:04,340 --> 00:51:10,880
You should be I've been saying this for a long time that you should be if they reboot mythbusters you it should be you

1089
00:51:10,880 --> 00:51:14,120
You as one team and then me and the girl as the other team.

1090
00:51:14,120 --> 00:51:17,680
They should reboot the Manhattan Project and let you make the next atomic bomb.

1091
00:51:17,680 --> 00:51:18,680
Me?

1092
00:51:18,680 --> 00:51:19,680
Yeah.

1093
00:51:19,680 --> 00:51:20,680
I'd probably make it fart when it explodes.

1094
00:51:20,680 --> 00:51:22,520
That's what I'm saying, you'd save the world.

1095
00:51:22,520 --> 00:51:26,400
I'd probably make it fart when it explodes and then if the people who got disintegrated

1096
00:51:26,400 --> 00:51:28,200
heard it before they died, they'd laugh.

1097
00:51:28,200 --> 00:51:30,200
They'd die with a big smile.

1098
00:51:30,200 --> 00:51:33,720
If you guys had the nuclear launch codes, where are you dropping it?

1099
00:51:33,720 --> 00:51:37,600
I would probably accidentally make that code my password for everything and then I'd get

1100
00:51:37,600 --> 00:51:38,600
hacked one day.

1101
00:51:38,600 --> 00:51:40,320
I'd probably drop it on Japan again.

1102
00:51:40,320 --> 00:51:46,600
Yeah, I would probably I guess I would probably I'd be logging on to the nuclear launch code website on the library computer and accidentally

1103
00:51:46,600 --> 00:51:51,440
Click the button for show password. Yeah, and the old guy jack off next we would see it and I'd be like, okay

1104
00:51:51,440 --> 00:51:56,420
Well, fuck it if he knows that he sends a nuke to Lana Rhodes house because she won't answer his messages

1105
00:51:56,420 --> 00:52:00,840
She answers the messages

1106
00:52:08,960 --> 00:52:10,960
She's got like fucked over she's like

1107
00:52:10,960 --> 00:52:18,320
Or no she fucked over a bunch of people cuz it's some like crypto scam

1108
00:52:18,320 --> 00:52:23,480
We made an NFT of her asshole or something and people didn't it's had a smell effect

1109
00:52:23,480 --> 00:52:28,400
It had a smell effect a smell effect on her NFT. Yep on her NFT. It was a scratch-and-sniff

1110
00:52:28,400 --> 00:52:34,280
NFTs no fucking thanks. Yeah, those things thing is art. Yeah

1111
00:52:34,280 --> 00:52:37,960
- these NFTs are fucking

1112
00:52:37,960 --> 00:52:38,800
- Oh shit.

1113
00:52:38,800 --> 00:52:41,200
- I hate them.

1114
00:52:41,200 --> 00:52:42,040
- Yeah.

1115
00:52:42,040 --> 00:52:44,240
- Yeah, they're stupid.

1116
00:52:44,240 --> 00:52:45,360
They're not even artistic.

1117
00:52:45,360 --> 00:52:47,360
- It's like back in the day we had Mona Lisa

1118
00:52:47,360 --> 00:52:48,660
and now we got coronavirus.

1119
00:52:48,660 --> 00:52:51,280
(laughing)

1120
00:52:51,280 --> 00:52:55,720
- Damn, that took me a full second to understand that.

1121
00:52:55,720 --> 00:52:57,760
But that is a master class.

1122
00:52:57,760 --> 00:52:59,560
You should be teaching a master class.

1123
00:52:59,560 --> 00:53:00,800
- Is that camera blurry?

1124
00:53:00,800 --> 00:53:01,640
- You should be, just shut up.

1125
00:53:01,640 --> 00:53:03,040
- Yeah, just leave it alone.

1126
00:53:03,040 --> 00:53:06,200
Don't let it, why would it, why?

1127
00:53:06,200 --> 00:53:07,920
- The fans are gonna talk about it.

1128
00:53:07,920 --> 00:53:11,040
I don't think you're talking about it right now.

1129
00:53:11,040 --> 00:53:12,840
Someone's gonna say something. You're weird, man.

1130
00:53:12,840 --> 00:53:14,720
You are a weird guy. Someone's gonna say something.

1131
00:53:14,720 --> 00:53:17,200
Autofocus is on, more like the Autobots are on.

1132
00:53:17,200 --> 00:53:18,800
Can't wait for Rise of the Beasts.

1133
00:53:18,800 --> 00:53:20,320
Yeah, more like Autofarkus. Is that what they're doing?

1134
00:53:20,320 --> 00:53:21,240
Yeah.

1135
00:53:21,240 --> 00:53:23,400
That was my grandfather's name. We're doing Transformers.

1136
00:53:23,400 --> 00:53:24,720
My grandfather. We're doing Transformers right now.

1137
00:53:24,720 --> 00:53:26,320
Autofarkus Doran.

1138
00:53:26,320 --> 00:53:28,480
Optimus Primal. That's not your...

1139
00:53:28,480 --> 00:53:29,520
What are you talking about?

1140
00:53:29,520 --> 00:53:32,320
My grandfather, Autofarkus.

1141
00:53:32,320 --> 00:53:34,080
Are you crazy now? I'm going crazy.

1142
00:53:34,080 --> 00:53:35,840
Did you lose your fucking mind today?

1143
00:53:35,840 --> 00:53:36,680
Yeah, what's wrong with you?

1144
00:53:36,680 --> 00:53:37,920
- Marbles are at the door.

1145
00:53:37,920 --> 00:53:39,240
- You did the rap and then--

1146
00:53:39,240 --> 00:53:40,320
- He left his marbles at the door.

1147
00:53:40,320 --> 00:53:41,160
- And I didn't lose 'em.

1148
00:53:41,160 --> 00:53:42,000
- The rap really was uncharacteristic.

1149
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:44,520
- Everything around the rap was just like,

1150
00:53:44,520 --> 00:53:47,320
you were so lucid for like a full 90 seconds

1151
00:53:47,320 --> 00:53:50,040
and you've just been crazy the rest of the episode.

1152
00:53:50,040 --> 00:53:50,880
- I've been crazy?

1153
00:53:50,880 --> 00:53:53,400
- You've been crazy, you've just been like babbling yourself

1154
00:53:53,400 --> 00:53:55,080
and going blah, blah, blah, blah.

1155
00:53:55,080 --> 00:53:58,440
- I didn't take my Adderall today, so maybe.

1156
00:53:58,440 --> 00:53:59,600
- So you maybe are crazy.

1157
00:53:59,600 --> 00:54:00,440
- Yeah, maybe.

1158
00:54:00,440 --> 00:54:02,920
- Yeah, did you take your anti-psychotic lunatic pills?

1159
00:54:02,920 --> 00:54:03,760
- No.

1160
00:54:03,760 --> 00:54:04,580
- Blah, blah, blah, blah.

1161
00:54:04,580 --> 00:54:05,420
- I did take--

1162
00:54:05,420 --> 00:54:06,260
- That didn't just happen.

1163
00:54:06,260 --> 00:54:09,460
I did take my anti-psychotics. I got a beet juice.

1164
00:54:09,460 --> 00:54:12,980
And I'm treating all of my mental illness with beet juice.

1165
00:54:12,980 --> 00:54:15,980
Okay. Is it working? Yes, look at me.

1166
00:54:15,980 --> 00:54:18,260
Yeah, I'm hoping that... Don't do that.

1167
00:54:18,260 --> 00:54:22,180
Speaking of beet juice, I fucking hate hipsters. I'm hoping the soda industry beats juice.

1168
00:54:22,180 --> 00:54:24,860
Yeah, that's right. Let's go soda! Woo!

1169
00:54:24,860 --> 00:54:27,860
And juice? Suck my dick, you fucking oaf.

1170
00:54:27,860 --> 00:54:31,560
Whoa, you did the fucking poem about Kanye and now you're saying that?

1171
00:54:31,560 --> 00:54:33,860
No, whoa!

1172
00:54:33,860 --> 00:54:37,860
Whoa, I'm talking about different vegetable and fruit juices.

1173
00:54:37,860 --> 00:54:39,360
That's messed up, man.

1174
00:54:39,360 --> 00:54:40,860
No, I didn't mean it like that, man.

1175
00:54:40,860 --> 00:54:42,860
You can't be saying that in that costume.

1176
00:54:42,860 --> 00:54:46,860
Saying that your holiday is better.

1177
00:54:46,860 --> 00:54:49,360
Better than what? You know what? I don't even know what you're talking about.

1178
00:54:49,360 --> 00:54:49,860
Okay.

1179
00:54:49,860 --> 00:54:50,360
That's right.

1180
00:54:50,360 --> 00:54:51,360
Juice day.

1181
00:54:51,360 --> 00:54:52,860
It's a good strategy.

1182
00:54:52,860 --> 00:54:53,860
Juice world.

1183
00:54:53,860 --> 00:54:54,360
Yeah.

1184
00:54:54,360 --> 00:54:57,860
There's definitely something anti-Semitic you can say about that.

1185
00:55:00,860 --> 00:55:04,860
I've become a businessman, I think, in my subconscious brain.

1186
00:55:04,860 --> 00:55:08,860
That has to be an amazing opening sentence for me.

1187
00:55:08,860 --> 00:55:10,860
That's going to be a 7-5.

1188
00:55:10,860 --> 00:55:13,860
Well, it's not really an opening sentence.

1189
00:55:13,860 --> 00:55:16,860
No, I'm just saying I like it and I'd like for you to continue.

1190
00:55:16,860 --> 00:55:19,860
In my sleep, I was talking about strategies.

1191
00:55:19,860 --> 00:55:22,860
What's the report?

1192
00:55:22,860 --> 00:55:24,860
What do you mean you were talking about? What did you say?

1193
00:55:24,860 --> 00:55:26,860
Let me hear some things you said.

1194
00:55:26,860 --> 00:55:31,620
All that I was told is that I said we need to use some new strategies

1195
00:55:31,620 --> 00:55:38,860
Man we really have gone so corporate, bro. I know having corporate dreams about strategies. Yeah

1196
00:55:38,860 --> 00:55:45,240
Synergistic stuff my girlfriend's I woke up like eight times in the night, and I wouldn't stop talking about strategy

1197
00:55:45,240 --> 00:55:53,580
Which I don't think I've ever talked about strategy in my life, I've heard you say it you've talked about maybe about video games

1198
00:55:53,580 --> 00:55:58,960
Yeah, yeah, you're talking you and patches are all talking all the time like oh, what's the best strategy for this dark souls boss?

1199
00:55:58,960 --> 00:56:02,140
Meanwhile well, it's usually dodged the attacks. Yeah

1200
00:56:02,140 --> 00:56:06,200
Okay, and Patrick talking about how much dark holes cost yeah

1201
00:56:06,200 --> 00:56:10,380
What 150 not that much 150?

1202
00:56:17,220 --> 00:56:21,800
There was women in Las Vegas who had sandwich signs on and I know you're thinking

1203
00:56:21,800 --> 00:56:27,060
Hungry different kind of sandwich sign on either side. There's a sign. Okay, just before you know what that is

1204
00:56:27,060 --> 00:56:29,060
Okay. Yeah, right now you do

1205
00:56:29,060 --> 00:56:34,260
There were women with signs on that said in your room 20 minutes or less

1206
00:56:34,260 --> 00:56:40,140
They were prostitutes who were wearing signs to sell their own fucking sex Wow

1207
00:56:40,140 --> 00:56:44,900
And then so I saw two women like that and then I saw a fat guy wearing the sign

1208
00:56:44,900 --> 00:56:50,300
Prostitutes, and here's my rhyme about that. Prostitutes, what's the cost of this?

1209
00:56:50,300 --> 00:56:52,900
Yeah, probably not that much.

1210
00:56:52,900 --> 00:56:53,900
Probably low.

1211
00:56:53,900 --> 00:56:55,900
In Las Vegas, yeah, if they're 20 minutes or less.

1212
00:56:55,900 --> 00:56:59,900
Even if it's a million dollars, I'll just win that money and it's not an object.

1213
00:56:59,900 --> 00:57:01,900
I definitely saw some prostitutes while I was there.

1214
00:57:01,900 --> 00:57:03,900
Yeah, you just said that.

1215
00:57:03,900 --> 00:57:04,900
I saw a lot of them.

1216
00:57:04,900 --> 00:57:05,900
Yeah.

1217
00:57:05,900 --> 00:57:08,900
All around. They're crawling.

1218
00:57:08,900 --> 00:57:11,900
Yeah, well that's why they call it Las Vegas. Moral code.

1219
00:57:11,900 --> 00:57:12,900
Uh-huh.

1220
00:57:12,900 --> 00:57:20,960
It's a it's a it's it's decrepit. Yeah, and all those all those damn prostitutes lost the elasticity in their vague vaginas

1221
00:57:20,960 --> 00:57:28,780
Something I think there's I think weird we got our second gas leak

1222
00:57:28,780 --> 00:57:37,300
Something's wrong

1223
00:57:37,300 --> 00:57:42,320
That's okay people like the gas leak stuff. Yeah, should I bring the gas leak detector to the office?

1224
00:57:42,320 --> 00:57:47,120
It's over there! It's just dead. It's dead, there's no batteries in it.

1225
00:57:47,120 --> 00:57:51,320
We'll be dead soon. There's no gas in here! How could there be a gas leak?

1226
00:57:51,320 --> 00:57:55,320
Here, I can give you a battery. What kind of batteries does it take?

1227
00:57:55,320 --> 00:57:58,320
Oh, fuck. A bunch of them. Triple A. Triple A?

1228
00:57:58,320 --> 00:57:59,820
Three of them. Three of them?

1229
00:57:59,820 --> 00:58:02,820
We only have two in that. Here's what we'll do. We'll open...

1230
00:58:02,820 --> 00:58:05,320
There's some in this, but I'll...

1231
00:58:05,320 --> 00:58:07,320
God, we just...

1232
00:58:07,320 --> 00:58:10,320
...some in the audio recorder.

1233
00:58:10,320 --> 00:58:11,240
Actually, you know what?

1234
00:58:11,240 --> 00:58:12,800
Actually, no, there are some--

1235
00:58:12,800 --> 00:58:14,840
Yeah, I bought AAA batteries like a week ago.

1236
00:58:14,840 --> 00:58:17,120
I did too, but they're old ones, and they're

1237
00:58:17,120 --> 00:58:18,720
in that direction.

1238
00:58:18,720 --> 00:58:21,160
Yeah, we definitely don't even need it on, dude.

1239
00:58:21,160 --> 00:58:22,800
There's something in the air.

1240
00:58:22,800 --> 00:58:24,640
There's something seriously bad in the air.

1241
00:58:24,640 --> 00:58:25,000
Yeah, it's Christmas spirit.

1242
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:26,440
I hope it's just Christmas spirit.

1243
00:58:26,440 --> 00:58:28,040
We need to get a Christmas spirit detector.

1244
00:58:28,040 --> 00:58:28,720
Yule fumes.

1245
00:58:28,720 --> 00:58:29,720
Oh, wait, wait, wait.

1246
00:58:29,720 --> 00:58:33,000
We can just put the word Christmas spirit right here.

1247
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:33,520
OK.

1248
00:58:33,520 --> 00:58:36,800
Christmas spirit detector.

1249
00:58:36,800 --> 00:58:39,480
So there are dangerous levels of yuletide fumes in this room.

1250
00:58:39,480 --> 00:58:42,480
Should be I think this should be a permanent table ornament

1251
00:58:42,480 --> 00:58:47,400
Yeah, we should put that on the wall and just run it at the beginning of every episode just to do a quick check quick

1252
00:58:47,400 --> 00:58:50,120
Baseline why would it stick here a baseline?

1253
00:58:50,120 --> 00:58:53,160
Why would it just stick for no?

1254
00:58:53,160 --> 00:58:59,500
You thought it would stick by just thought it was holding it on the wall touched it no

1255
00:58:59,500 --> 00:59:05,500
Great you destroy that's my stocking and I don't want that for Christmas so meanwhile. This is my stocking

1256
00:59:05,500 --> 00:59:08,320
That's Patrick's and that's Caleb so Patrick can put that in his own stocking

1257
00:59:08,320 --> 00:59:11,760
He has the lowest stocking cuz he's the littlest brother. Yeah, he is the little brother

1258
00:59:11,760 --> 00:59:15,280
We probably have a tied stocking

1259
00:59:15,280 --> 00:59:20,240
There's that there it is

1260
00:59:20,240 --> 00:59:24,160
There it is. I don't know if that needed a punch in I'm gonna be real with you

1261
00:59:24,160 --> 00:59:29,560
It's pretty clear could have I would be so scared if I woke up on Christmas morning. I saw that poking

1262
00:59:32,440 --> 00:59:34,440
Whoa

1263
00:59:34,440 --> 00:59:38,240
Yeah, it's probably been blurry the whole episode huh it has been

1264
00:59:38,240 --> 00:59:44,380
It has been we got to get a camera that has work has bins. Yeah, we're washed up

1265
00:59:44,380 --> 00:59:52,680
I'm a complete wash up not me. I'm Santa Claus. I'm frozen. I'm dressed exactly like I'm Olaf from frozen

1266
00:59:52,680 --> 00:59:54,680
Yeah, that's right. I'm Josh Gad

1267
00:59:54,680 --> 00:59:57,880
You could be a gad type yeah

1268
00:59:58,440 --> 01:00:03,240
I was saved from doing a musical theater as a kid because my grandpa died.

1269
01:00:03,240 --> 01:00:08,120
Really? My grandpa died and the Peter Pan musical was the day of his funeral.

1270
01:00:08,120 --> 01:00:12,920
I was saved by what? I was pirate number two. I was saved by my own homophobia as a child.

1271
01:00:12,920 --> 01:00:19,400
I think I would have unlocked a lot more if I had done theater.

1272
01:00:19,400 --> 01:00:24,760
I was saved because my voice was too good. Oh yeah. I was like you show all the other kids.

1273
01:00:24,760 --> 01:00:30,320
I didn't make it. They were like, you listen, if you want to do musical theater, you have to go with the college kids.

1274
01:00:30,320 --> 01:00:33,080
I went out for Captain Hook. That would stunt my social growth.

1275
01:00:33,080 --> 01:00:37,040
True. So I went out for Captain Hook in the school play.

1276
01:00:37,040 --> 01:00:38,840
You went out with Captain Hook. I went out for Captain Hook.

1277
01:00:38,840 --> 01:00:41,240
I wanted to be. You went out with Peter Pan for Captain Hook.

1278
01:00:41,240 --> 01:00:45,240
I wanted to be Captain Hook and I made no, I made no choices.

1279
01:00:45,240 --> 01:00:49,120
No, no drastic choices. That is dangerous as a performer.

1280
01:00:49,120 --> 01:00:53,560
I went up. You have to make big choices. I tried to play Captain Hook raw and real.

1281
01:00:53,560 --> 01:00:56,440
I went up and I said, "Fuck Peter Pan!"

1282
01:00:56,440 --> 01:00:57,440
I did one musical.

1283
01:00:57,440 --> 01:00:58,440
"Little ass kid!"

1284
01:00:58,440 --> 01:00:59,440
You didn't say that.

1285
01:00:59,440 --> 01:01:00,440
"I'm gonna beat the shit out of him!"

1286
01:01:00,440 --> 01:01:01,440
That's a strong choice.

1287
01:01:01,440 --> 01:01:02,440
You did a Gritty, Captain Hook?

1288
01:01:02,440 --> 01:01:03,440
Yeah.

1289
01:01:03,440 --> 01:01:04,440
No you didn't, that's bullshit.

1290
01:01:04,440 --> 01:01:05,440
I played Gritty.

1291
01:01:05,440 --> 01:01:09,440
I actually was in a musical I just remembered, and I think I've talked about this maybe.

1292
01:01:09,440 --> 01:01:10,440
Maybe not.

1293
01:01:10,440 --> 01:01:16,840
I was in a musical for my church, and I was the secondary star, and I had to, and my guy,

1294
01:01:16,840 --> 01:01:19,360
my character had a broken leg, so I had to wear a cast, right?

1295
01:01:19,360 --> 01:01:20,360
You were Tiny Tim?

1296
01:01:20,360 --> 01:01:23,080
No, fuck no, I wasn't Tiny Tim.

1297
01:01:23,080 --> 01:01:25,840
I had a broken leg, right, and I had crutches, right?

1298
01:01:25,840 --> 01:01:26,880
- In real life.

1299
01:01:26,880 --> 01:01:31,160
- No, let me finish my musical story.

1300
01:01:31,160 --> 01:01:33,240
I had broken leg, I had crutches,

1301
01:01:33,240 --> 01:01:35,560
and in the thing, in the musical,

1302
01:01:35,560 --> 01:01:37,720
I pray to God, God heals my leg.

1303
01:01:37,720 --> 01:01:40,360
The musical ends, I ran around the entire church.

1304
01:01:40,360 --> 01:01:42,040
(laughing)

1305
01:01:42,040 --> 01:01:43,080
Ran around singing.

1306
01:01:43,080 --> 01:01:45,480
Ran around the whole church singing.

1307
01:01:45,480 --> 01:01:46,720
- Do you remember the song?

1308
01:01:46,720 --> 01:01:51,220
- It was like, ♪ God is a virgin ♪

1309
01:01:51,220 --> 01:01:52,340
- God is a virgin?

1310
01:01:52,340 --> 01:01:52,840
No.

1311
01:01:52,840 --> 01:01:55,700
(SINGING) God is a thug and a booby-de-doo.

1312
01:01:55,700 --> 01:01:57,060
It was something like that.

1313
01:01:57,060 --> 01:01:58,820
I know "God is a thug and a booby-de-doo."

1314
01:01:58,820 --> 01:02:01,580
But basically, my mom made me do it,

1315
01:02:01,580 --> 01:02:03,860
and I never ever forgave her.

1316
01:02:03,860 --> 01:02:04,540
Yeah.

1317
01:02:04,540 --> 01:02:06,300
Fucking hate her for that.

1318
01:02:06,300 --> 01:02:06,800
Really?

1319
01:02:06,800 --> 01:02:09,380
She made me cry in the rehearsal,

1320
01:02:09,380 --> 01:02:10,580
because I had to do push-ups.

1321
01:02:10,580 --> 01:02:15,700
Oh my god.

1322
01:02:15,700 --> 01:02:16,700
I had to do 30 push-ups.

1323
01:02:16,700 --> 01:02:18,940
Oh my god.

1324
01:02:18,940 --> 01:02:19,440
What?

1325
01:02:19,440 --> 01:02:21,440
There's a red dot on your forehead.

1326
01:02:21,440 --> 01:02:24,960
I don't give a fuck. Kill me.

1327
01:02:24,960 --> 01:02:27,400
I don't even want to be alive anymore.

1328
01:02:27,400 --> 01:02:29,400
Wait, what happens? Can you switch to this camera?

1329
01:02:29,400 --> 01:02:31,400
I think it'll leave a mark on the lens.

1330
01:02:31,400 --> 01:02:36,760
I think it's a pretty good indicator that the episode is over if you start pointing around a red dot.

1331
01:02:36,760 --> 01:02:39,000
All right.

1337
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:55,560

1338
01:02:55,560 --> 01:02:56,560

01:02:56,560 --> 01:02:59,560
And it is business formal, it'll be sending out evites I've been told.

1340
01:02:59,560 --> 01:03:00,920
I do think you'll be getting an evite.

1341
01:03:00,920 --> 01:03:08,680
You have to wear a suit, or maybe a collared shirt under a sweater, or a Victorian dress.

1342
01:03:08,680 --> 01:03:10,600
You can wear a dress if you're inclined in that way.

1343
01:03:10,600 --> 01:03:14,720
If you're a girl you can wear a dress, or you can wear a powerful pant suit.

1344
01:03:14,720 --> 01:03:15,720
But that's about it.

01:03:15,720 --> 01:03:18,560

1346

01:04:06,360 --> 01:04:08,360
Yeah, you're gonna wish you was just a Will Smith slapper.

1371
