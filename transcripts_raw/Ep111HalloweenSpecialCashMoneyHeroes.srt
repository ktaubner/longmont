(laughing)

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:12,840
(explosion)

6
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:13,660

7
00:00:13,660 --> 00:00:14,500

00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:15,340
- Boom.

9
00:00:15,340 --> 00:00:16,160
(screaming)

10
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:17,000

00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,460
- Boom.

12
00:00:18,460 --> 00:00:21,800
- Welcome to the Podcasts About List Halloween special.

13
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:22,640
- Yeah.

14
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:23,460
(screaming)

15
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:26,400
- It's, today it's set a podcast about List,

16
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:28,240
it's ghost cast about--

17
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:30,160
- Mist.

18
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:31,000
- Mist.

19
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,400
The mist of the ghost.

20
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:33,240
- Oh no.

21
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:35,840
Podcast about myths.

22
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:36,680
- Oh my God.

23
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:38,880
Don't, if you're gonna scream like that,

24
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:41,480
you have to do it far away from the microphone, okay?

25
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:43,040
- Podcast about crypts.

26
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:44,320
- Not because I care about it,

27
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:46,080
but because it will ruin the audio.

28
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:47,200
No, just move your head away.

29
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:48,880
You don't have to move the whole arm.

30
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:52,200
It's gonna make a weird noise on the audio.

31
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:53,040
- Well then it's adding to the scariest.

32
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:58,040
- All right, now podcast about a split, a body in half.

33
00:00:58,040 --> 00:01:05,040
and

34
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:12,720
about a creature in the fall

35
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:14,480
it

36
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:15,480
it

37
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:19,760
this is our very own this is like a dream queen our treehouse of horror

38
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:20,600
uh...

39
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:24,680
because it is a it is coming out on and i see on skos

40
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:25,680
in the treehouse.

41
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:29,040
Alright, now I feel sick every time I scream.

42
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:30,040
Are you kidding me?

43
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:31,040
You're that...

44
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:32,040
Yeah, you need to go to the doctor.

45
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:33,040
Are you that fragile?

46
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:34,040
Yeah.

47
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:35,040
A scream throws you out of homeostasis?

48
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:39,240
Oh no, I've been screaming all morning, so that was actually the youngest scream I did.

49
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:40,880
This was almost a chicken brain episode.

50
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:43,000
I found a chicken spot in town.

51
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
No.

52
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Uh-huh.

53
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
No, don't do it.

54
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,360
I had to lay down for a little bit.

55
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:49,080
I had to get the chicken out of my system.

56
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:51,120
You know better than that.

57
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:52,120
I know, I forgot.

58
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:55,200
I forgot what chicken does to us before we record.

59
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:57,720
I don't think it's the meat, I think it's the skin.

60
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:58,720
It's the skin.

61
00:01:58,720 --> 00:01:59,720
It's the skin.

62
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:02,320
The skin on that chicken was good.

63
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:03,800
I think it might be the curse.

64
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:04,800
Yeah.

65
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:05,800
The curse of chicken?

66
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:10,960
I think it might be the curse that the witch put on us to be stupid when we eat chicken.

67
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:13,320
I forgot about the curse.

68
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:14,560
Duh.

69
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:16,600
You guys are so stupid.

70
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:17,600
Everything has to be scary.

71
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:20,240
This is also, this is episode 111, okay?

72
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:23,760
There's six of us that do the podcast.

73
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:26,160
Six times, 'cause we all have split personalities

74
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:28,000
like Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde.

75
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:28,840
Yeah. Six times one, one, one.

76
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:30,800
Yours is Mrs. Hyde.

77
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:32,840
No. That's your split personality.

78
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:34,920
Yeah, at night you turn into Mrs. Hyde.

79
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:36,320
No, mine is Mr. Fly.

80
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:39,440
And I'm very cool.

81
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:40,400
No. Yeah.

82
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:41,240
You can't fly.

83
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:43,040
Six times one, one, one.

84
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:45,320
You guessed it, Friday the 13th.

85
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:47,240
The scariest number of all time.

86
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:48,080
No.

87
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:51,220
- We're gonna start off this episode

88
00:02:51,220 --> 00:02:53,880
with some very scary stories.

89
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:56,760
- Yeah, we're gonna tell scary stories around the campfire.

90
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:59,000
- Yeah, we have a campfire here.

91
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,040
I'm smoking a cigar.

92
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:04,040
We're gonna tell a scary story.

93
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:07,760
- I just put a whole, I dropped a sausage into the campfire.

94
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:09,400
- Why do you pick it up?

95
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:12,520
- I'm roasting a Ritz cracker on a skewer

96
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:13,920
like it's a marshmallow.

97
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:15,560
- I'm roasting a human leg.

98
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:16,400
- Oh my God.

99
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:25,200
Patrick if you want I just want to just like a quick sidebar um there's a very easy fix

100
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:29,740
to make people stop saying they want to hit you with the bus and it's to not scream directly

101
00:03:29,740 --> 00:03:32,240
into the mic every 30 seconds on this episode.

102
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:38,160
Wait hold on hold on Patrick needs to fillet the mic really quick.

103
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:40,600
Did he mute himself?

104
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:41,600
Did you mute yourself?

105
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:42,600
Yeah.

106
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:45,600
How much you want to I bet that screwed up your audio in audacity.

107
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:46,600
I did not.

108
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:47,600
Alright.

109
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:49,600
My audio's fine, I just clicked a button.

110
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:50,600
Anyway, we're at the campfire.

111
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:51,600
Yeah.

112
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:52,600
We're gonna tell some stories.

113
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:54,600
Cameron, how 'bout you go first?

114
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:56,600
Oh, I have to go first?

115
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:57,600
Or, or...

116
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:58,600
Okay, I'll go first.

117
00:03:58,600 --> 00:03:59,600
Someone, or someone else?

118
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:00,600
I'll go first.

119
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:04,600
Alright, no, wait, Patrick just left, so I guess, um...

120
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:05,600
Yeah, no, that's fine.

121
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:09,600
Yeah, just stand up and walk away in the first fucking five minutes of the episode.

122
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:10,600
Yeah, the campfire's here.

123
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:12,600
Dude, the campfire's gonna go out.

124
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:13,600
out.

125
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:16,560
Caleb was doing a voice that was too scary and I got too scared.

126
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:17,560
You didn't get that scared.

127
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:18,560
I had to leave the room.

128
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:19,560
You did not get that scared.

129
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:21,160
I got so scared just now.

130
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:23,600
Are you guys ready for my scary story?

131
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:25,880
I'm gonna leave again.

132
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:29,480
This is gonna scare the pants right off you.

133
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:34,040
This story is called the terrifying story of the crazy murderer.

134
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:35,040
Can you take it back?

135
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:36,040
No!

136
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:37,480
Take it back dude!

137
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:38,480
I'm serious.

138
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:40,120
Alright, are you guys ready?

139
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:41,600
I know.

140
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:42,880
Of course not.

141
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:43,880
Why not?

142
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:44,880
Wait.

143
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:45,880
Maybe I'll do that.

144
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:47,200
Maybe I'll do a light scream.

145
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:49,080
That's smart.

146
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:53,680
Is this working?

147
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:56,520
It was a dark and evil night.

148
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:58,480
Not a creature was stirring.

149
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:01,320
Except for some ghosts!

150
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:04,440
But that's a story for another time.

151
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:08,420
Little twelve year old Patrick lived alone with his mom and dad and brothers and sisters

152
00:05:08,420 --> 00:05:11,700
and his aunt lived next door and he had two hairless cats.

153
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:14,500
But his brothers and sisters were away on vacation,

154
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:16,540
and his aunt was in timeout.

155
00:05:16,540 --> 00:05:18,820
And tonight, on Friday the 13th,

156
00:05:18,820 --> 00:05:21,340
his parents were going on a date.

157
00:05:21,340 --> 00:05:23,300
They hired a babysitter and they were talking

158
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:25,780
to the babysitter about the rules of the house.

159
00:05:25,780 --> 00:05:28,940
- That fell out of his chair.

160
00:05:28,940 --> 00:05:31,180
(laughing)

161
00:05:31,180 --> 00:05:36,300
- Are you okay, Patrick?

162
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:37,140
- One second.

163
00:05:37,140 --> 00:05:44,220
say something you have to stop scaring me so much

164
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:49,220
down cam fuck did they were talking to the babysitter about the rules of the

165
00:05:49,220 --> 00:05:53,700
house one Patrick can't play with toys to

166
00:05:53,700 --> 00:06:05,220
he really hurt himself he broke just broke something in his house

167
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:12,740
Rule number two. I'm telling you right now, stop scaring me. Rule number two.

168
00:06:12,740 --> 00:06:21,740
Patrick can't eat snacks. I'm not gonna do it again. Rule number three. You can't even see it. You can't even see it. I don't know why I'm still doing it.

169
00:06:21,740 --> 00:06:29,740
Patrick can only watch one minute of TV per night. Patrick started to cry and went to lie down in his room from sadness.

170
00:06:29,740 --> 00:06:34,740
Right before Patrick's mom and dad went out to their date, his dad stopped and turned to the babysitter.

171
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:39,740
"One more thing," he said. "There's a freak on the loose in the neighborhood tonight."

172
00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:44,740
"A freak?" asked the babysitter. Her name was Vicky the Babysitter, by the way.

173
00:06:44,740 --> 00:06:50,740
"Yes, a freak," said Patrick's dad. "He's a serial killer, and he's obsessed with killing babysitters.

174
00:06:50,740 --> 00:06:53,740
He was in the asylum, but he escaped by getting out of his cell.

175
00:06:53,740 --> 00:06:56,740
Now he's walking around the neighborhood looking for babysitters."

176
00:06:56,740 --> 00:06:57,240
*snickers*

177
00:06:57,240 --> 00:07:21,920
*wheezes*

178
00:07:26,060 --> 00:07:29,940
Crazy Murderer is from Egypt, so he can cast a mummy's curse on his victims.

179
00:07:29,940 --> 00:07:32,460
He's also Native American, so he can shapeshift.

180
00:07:32,460 --> 00:07:36,060
He can time travel, so he has visited every world culture, and he has a place in their

181
00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:37,060
legends.

182
00:07:37,060 --> 00:07:40,100
He's also a werewolf, which is separate from the shapeshifting, by the way.

183
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:42,860
But tonight is the full moon, Vicky said.

184
00:07:42,860 --> 00:07:45,180
Exactly, said Patrick's dad.

185
00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:48,500
That means the Crazy Murderer will turn into a wolf with blood-red eyes.

186
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:52,420
He can smell children being babysat from 100 miles away, and he has a hook in place of

187
00:07:52,420 --> 00:07:55,220
one hand so that he can catch children like a fish.

188
00:07:55,220 --> 00:07:59,060
He drives an ice cream truck, but instead of selling ice cream, it sells blood and eyeballs.

189
00:07:59,060 --> 00:08:02,460
The ice cream truck plays the Lavender Town scary music and it's driven by the ghost

190
00:08:02,460 --> 00:08:03,460
of a child.

191
00:08:03,460 --> 00:08:07,060
The crazy murderer rides in the backseat and sticks his head out the window like a dog.

192
00:08:07,060 --> 00:08:10,620
One time the window got rolled up by accident and it cut the crazy murderer's head off,

193
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:13,180
so it had to get stitched back on with barbed wire.

194
00:08:13,180 --> 00:08:15,560
He's immortal, so it's okay for his head to get cut off.

195
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:19,580
He has the eyes of a spider and the claws of a dark demon.

196
00:08:19,580 --> 00:08:21,780
So what do I do if he comes to the house?

197
00:08:21,780 --> 00:08:24,060
Asked Vicky the babysitter.

198
00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:28,360
He's already here. I can see him through the window, said Patrick's dad.

199
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:30,860
Then Vicky turned around and said, "Oh my god!"

200
00:08:30,860 --> 00:08:35,660
Also, Patrick's mom's mouth was sewed shut by a voodoo doctor. That's why she hasn't talked in the story.

201
00:08:35,660 --> 00:08:40,460
The reason Vicky the babysitter said "Oh my god" was because there was nothing at the window.

202
00:08:40,460 --> 00:08:42,660
Patrick's dad was just tricking her.

203
00:08:42,660 --> 00:08:46,760
She didn't realize that the people talking to her were never even Patrick's parents after all.

204
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:50,360
The dad was the crazy murderer all along, and the mom was Bloody Mary.

205
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:53,860
They were pretending to be Patrick's parents to get into the house and kill the babysitter.

206
00:08:53,860 --> 00:08:56,460
They killed the babysitter and drove away in the ice cream truck.

207
00:08:56,460 --> 00:08:59,260
The ghost child who drove the truck wicked at the camera.

208
00:08:59,260 --> 00:09:03,960
Patrick stopped crying and came downstairs because he sensed there was no more babysitter.

209
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:08,260
He was so excited he got his favorite Lego toy set and ate a corn dog and sat in front of the TV.

210
00:09:08,260 --> 00:09:14,360
He turned it on and Squidward's suicide was on the TV and he watched it for 10 minutes and went crazy.

211
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:20,460
He had to go to the asylum and turned into the crazy murderer.

212
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:28,160
Then, once he grew up, he time-traveled back to his house to kill Vicky the babysitter to get rid of all the rules from his house.

213
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:32,160
What happened to Patrick's real mom and dad, you may ask?

214
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:36,160
Well, remember the ghosts from the beginning of the story?

215
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:39,160
Yep, that was his parents.

216
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:41,160
BOO!

217
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:43,160
[PATRICK SCREAMS]

218
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:47,160
That's the story of the cr- the terrifying story of the crazy murderer.

219
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:48,160
My god.

220
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:49,160
I'm shaking.

221
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:50,720
I, even reading that was difficult for me.

222
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:53,200
I fell out of my chair twice.

223
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:56,920
Pat, what was that like for you?

224
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:57,920
I don't know.

225
00:09:57,920 --> 00:09:58,920
I fell out of my chair.

226
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:04,160
No, I mean, it was still in the, for that to happen to you.

227
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:05,240
Oh.

228
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:06,240
It's terrifying.

229
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:08,040
It was, I bet it was, dude.

230
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:09,040
I bet it was.

231
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:11,360
I mean, that's more terrifying than I could imagine.

232
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:12,360
Yeah.

233
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:14,560
If that happened to me, I would scream.

234
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:18,880
I fell out of the chair so hard I scared the cats out of ever coming to this room again.

235
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:20,320
You're kind of the horror movie.

236
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:23,400
Every life, every day of those cats' lives is always a horror movie.

237
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:26,320
You're just a monster who walks around and grabs them.

238
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:27,320
Yeah.

239
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:30,520
And shoves their balls in their friend's face.

240
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:33,520
Stomping around the house going, "Yeah!"

241
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:34,520
"Yeah!"

242
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:35,520
"Yeah!"

243
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:36,520
"Yeah!"

244
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:37,520
It's true.

245
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:38,520
It's true.

246
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:39,520
"Yeah!"

247
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:40,520
Alright.

248
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:42,240
Who's ready for another scary story?

249
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:43,240
I don't think I'm ready.

250
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:44,240
I'm freaking out.

251
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:51,560
a happy story here I'll tell a happy story yeah yeah there is a very there's a

252
00:10:51,560 --> 00:11:02,560
great there's a great movie it's called Air Force One it has Han Solo in it and

253
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:07,320
he's president and there's terrorists and they get on the plane as he's on and

254
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:11,600
then he has to fight them and he actually he's kill he kills every one of them and

255
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:12,880
and he survives.

256
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:14,080
- That's pretty good.

257
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:14,920
That's pretty happy.

258
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:15,800
- You guys feeling a little better?

259
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:17,560
- Yeah. - I feel a lot better.

260
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:18,880
- Okay.

261
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:19,800
Let's do another scariest,

262
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:21,200
Pat, you wanna say your scariest story?

263
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:23,080
- I'll tell my scariest story.

264
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:24,760
Okay.

265
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:26,640
Let me.

266
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:32,960
On the scariest night of the year,

267
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:34,160
Friday the 13th. - What night?

268
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:35,700
Okay.

269
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:39,800
- I came home to see my home in complete disarray.

270
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:45,360
I walked into the front door and all of my Funkos were out of their boxes.

271
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:50,120
I looked over to my wife's room and she wasn't in there with her awesome boyfriend.

272
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:56,200
I grew to be terrified of this so much that I dropped my bag of Woot Stouts on the ground

273
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:58,720
causing them all to explode.

274
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:03,400
The foamy hoppy goodness leaked all over my Mass Effect Asari body pillow that my wife

275
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:08,780
and her extraordinary boyfriend take turns watching me fuck every Friday night.

276
00:12:08,780 --> 00:12:13,240
The pillow absorbed most of the moisture, so I picked it up and started sucking the delicious

277
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:17,540
woot stout that I earned after a long week's work at the ThinkGeek factory.

278
00:12:17,540 --> 00:12:20,700
I sucked it right out of the pillow's pussy hole.

279
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:26,300
I was scared as hell, but I couldn't let that beautiful golden IPA go to waste.

280
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:29,220
Anyway, I digress.

281
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:34,700
The point of this story is that I was scared as hell, but I couldn't-

282
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:36,380
I was seriously terrified.

283
00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:38,060
I couldn't believe it.

284
00:12:38,060 --> 00:12:39,500
It had happened.

285
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:42,240
I couldn't believe my own eyes.

286
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:47,060
My 30-50 feral hogs had finally unionized.

287
00:12:47,060 --> 00:12:52,420
I ran to the door but tripped over my RC BB8 that I also fuck and I fell face first onto

288
00:12:52,420 --> 00:12:55,060
the floor and chipped all my teeth.

289
00:12:55,060 --> 00:12:59,540
Just then, an unfamiliar foot stomped right in my face.

290
00:12:59,540 --> 00:13:02,200
I looked up in sheer terror.

291
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:07,580
My 30-50 feral hogs brought carrel-freaking baskins into my home.

292
00:13:07,580 --> 00:13:08,420
- No.

293
00:13:08,420 --> 00:13:09,240
- No.

294
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:10,580
- To be continued.

295
00:13:10,580 --> 00:13:11,420
(laughing)

296
00:13:11,420 --> 00:13:13,860
- That's the scariest ending of all time.

297
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:15,920
- I think what's so scary about that is the,

298
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:18,220
is the cliffhanger at the end.

299
00:13:18,220 --> 00:13:20,180
- Yeah, anything could happen.

300
00:13:20,180 --> 00:13:22,240
- It also means that we have to go through it,

301
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:24,060
we sit through another scary story.

302
00:13:24,060 --> 00:13:24,900
- Yeah.

303
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:25,740
- Mm-hmm.

304
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:28,820
- That's the prospect of another scary story.

305
00:13:28,820 --> 00:13:31,520
We're not safe, there's no end yet, no end in sight.

306
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:32,360
- Yeah.

307
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:33,680
- All right, can someone tell a,

308
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:35,300
someone else tell a happy story?

309
00:13:35,300 --> 00:13:37,020
- Yeah, I got one for you.

310
00:13:37,020 --> 00:13:43,520
Basically, there's these little fellows that work for a guy named grew and they have missed they do mischief and come up with different inventions

311
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:46,820
the main okay, no

312
00:13:46,820 --> 00:13:53,860
No, that's I just came up with that I know what you're talking about really yeah, I just made it up

313
00:13:53,860 --> 00:14:00,060
We're gonna make you a millionaire. Yeah, I'm gonna think I'm thinking of making a movie about them called the the fellows

314
00:14:00,060 --> 00:14:02,780
the yellow fellows

315
00:14:02,780 --> 00:14:05,040
(laughing)

316
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:09,160
- Called I Am Despicable.

317
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:12,900
- You ready for my scary story?

318
00:14:12,900 --> 00:14:14,060
- Yeah.

319
00:14:14,060 --> 00:14:15,380
- All right.

320
00:14:15,380 --> 00:14:17,880
- This is called Scary Story by Caleb Pitts.

321
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:24,240
There was a carpenter, let me try that again.

322
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:29,940
There was a carpenter who traveled around the land

323
00:14:29,940 --> 00:14:35,580
growing his hair out really long, tanning and fucking perfect tans in every town he went

324
00:14:35,580 --> 00:14:36,580
to.

325
00:14:36,580 --> 00:14:42,240
He would have women wash his feet and they would gobble on his balls and then he'd probably

326
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:44,060
go surfing after that.

327
00:14:44,060 --> 00:14:48,900
He would do a thousand pull-ups a day and he was ripped.

328
00:14:48,900 --> 00:14:51,020
He had a squad of other jacked assholes.

329
00:14:51,020 --> 00:14:53,460
Yeah, I'm an asshole, so what?

330
00:14:53,460 --> 00:14:58,240
And they would tag team girls and they would eat huge feasts and they all had long ass

331
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:04,480
hair and they liked to fish together. Life was good. Then one day one of his friends

332
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:09,940
started tattletailing on him like a puss. He told the nerds of the town about his

333
00:15:09,940 --> 00:15:13,180
friend and about how much hole he was getting and about how much food he was

334
00:15:13,180 --> 00:15:19,180
eating. At the time you couldn't eat a lot of food at once it was illegal. The

335
00:15:19,180 --> 00:15:24,080
nerds controlled all of the banks in the town and so they had the power to stop

336
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:29,180
him the nerds grabbed a man and they punched him and then they put him onto a

337
00:15:29,180 --> 00:15:34,400
cross and they crucified him till he was dead now you may be thinking that's just

338
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:40,320
some story that could never actually happen but it did yeah happened to a man

339
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:50,080
named Jesus Christ died he died for your sin in the end of the story the end oh

340
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:52,080
Oh my god.

341
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:54,080
Oh my god.

342
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:56,080
I came up with this idea.

343
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:58,080
You know, loving your neighbor more.

344
00:15:58,080 --> 00:16:00,080
I have an idea for a sequel.

345
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:02,080
He could turn into a zombie.

346
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:05,080
And they could make a day to celebrate him turning into a zombie.

347
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:07,080
Oh my god.

348
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:09,080
That would be even more terrifying.

349

Yeah.

421
00:19:57,880 --> 00:20:01,880
yeah yeah maybe they don't want us taking it because it's too hard to pronounce

422
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:06,120
that's what it is yeah they need to come up with doctors don't want to have to write that

423
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:08,280
whole thing down on a prescription yeah

424
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:16,040

00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:33,880
Yeah, we're just gonna give you Advil. Yeah. Doctors, doctors are trying to get rid, to stop

429
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:36,680
people from drinking bleach because they're worried there's not going to be enough left

430
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:43,560
to use on their lab coats. That's true. Keep it crispy white. Yeah. Yeah. There'd be a shortage.

431
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:49,000
Use your brain, dude. Escape from the prison they construct for you. Escape from where they want

432
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:53,480
you to work. Escape from which mountain? Escape from which mountain, Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson.

433
00:20:53,480 --> 00:21:01,520
get scared of it. So today in keeping with the Halloween theme and the theme of

434
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:07,480
fear yeah we are doing the top 10 scariest things ever on the top tens

435
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:11,560
yeah and so and I thought that we had done this list before but I looked back

436
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:17,320
into our archive and we unlocked the vault and back into the dark 31 which

437
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:24,200
interestingly today Halloween is also in its own way kind of a dark 31. Oh my god.

438
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:28,720
We did the list top 10 scariest things ever to see so it's completely different

439
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:32,960
from this list so it's a different completely different. It's true. We're fine.

440
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:39,400
This is new content. Number one scariest thing ever is being buried alive. Not

441
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:44,080
that scary. Yeah it's scary are you kidding me? If you think about it okay

442
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:47,520
Well, they're not being specific. Okay, imagine this you

443
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:53,920
Are hanging out in your house? Okay, you're playing video games. You're watching TV, right?

444
00:21:53,920 --> 00:22:00,040
You think I need to take the dog out you open up your front door and it's just a block of dirt

445
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:04,040
And you realize that your entire house has been buried underground. Yeah

446
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:12,720
Well, your life's not any all right here here's a better shit in your bed, but that's fine. Here's a better scenario

447
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:20,460
you wake up you find out that you're buried under 1 million coins that's one

448
00:22:20,460 --> 00:22:27,060
of the million gold coins like screw in your under screws medux money pit my

449
00:22:27,060 --> 00:22:29,860
dog my dog

450
00:22:29,860 --> 00:22:38,660
yeah yeah how do you get out of that you have to spend all the money

451
00:22:38,660 --> 00:22:39,500
- You do.

452
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:40,320
- No!

453
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:42,160
- Dude, you got something to do.

454
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:45,400
- You put Amazon orders in, you get them COD,

455
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:48,660
and then they have to, so once you get out

456
00:22:48,660 --> 00:22:51,500
of the gold coin pit, you got a bunch of packages.

457
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:54,100
- Holy crap, and you get to do unboxing videos.

458
00:22:54,100 --> 00:22:56,580
- And yeah, then you grow your wealth.

459
00:22:56,580 --> 00:22:57,420
- Exactly.

460
00:22:57,420 --> 00:22:58,260
- You grow your wealth.

461
00:22:58,260 --> 00:23:00,740
- And then you realize that you got knocked out

462
00:23:00,740 --> 00:23:04,220
from all the coin amnesia, and that's what actually

463
00:23:04,220 --> 00:23:05,980
put you under the coins in the first place.

464
00:23:05,980 --> 00:23:06,820
- And then you're trapped in an infinite loop.

465
00:23:06,820 --> 00:23:08,780
- Because you're making so much AdSense money,

466
00:23:08,780 --> 00:23:10,500
and then you keep doing it because you keep forgetting.

467
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:11,340
- Hold up.

468
00:23:11,340 --> 00:23:12,900
- And then you have to write, and then you write,

469
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:14,180
you're not very smart though.

470
00:23:14,180 --> 00:23:16,880
So you try to do a memento thing where you remind yourself

471
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:19,460
with tattoos on your body, but you just write coins

472
00:23:19,460 --> 00:23:20,300
on your arm.

473
00:23:20,300 --> 00:23:22,340
- Yeah, and then you look around and you go, yep.

474
00:23:22,340 --> 00:23:23,500
- Yep, that's about right.

475
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:24,980
- There are coins.

476
00:23:24,980 --> 00:23:27,260
- That's a really good point, Arm.

477
00:23:27,260 --> 00:23:29,100
- Here's a comment on this one that says,

478
00:23:29,100 --> 00:23:31,300
what about your house burning on fire?

479
00:23:31,300 --> 00:23:33,140
I'm not saying this is the scariest thing,

480
00:23:33,140 --> 00:23:35,280
but it is the scariest thing that ever happened to me.

481
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:37,560
It happened to me in February of 2018.

482
00:23:37,560 --> 00:23:39,400
A house two doors down from me was on fire.

483
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:41,400
I live in a townhouse, so all the houses are connected.

484
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:42,900
And it spread to the house right next door,

485
00:23:42,900 --> 00:23:44,200
and then my roof was smoking.

486
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:45,640
But my house didn't go on fire,

487
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:46,540
but I was very scared

488
00:23:46,540 --> 00:23:48,140
because I thought my house might burn down.

489
00:23:48,140 --> 00:23:51,180
I hadn't got my diary or my books or my clothes.

490
00:23:51,180 --> 00:23:52,860
- Whoa.

491
00:23:52,860 --> 00:23:56,060
- Yeah, if my stuff got burnt, I'd be so scared.

492
00:23:56,060 --> 00:23:58,400
- Yeah, if my roof started smoking.

493
00:23:58,400 --> 00:23:59,240
- Uh-huh.

494
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:01,320
- You know I'm grabbing my diary first.

495
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:03,940
- Grabbing my diary, I'm grabbing my Palm Pilot,

496
00:24:03,940 --> 00:24:06,840
I'm grabbing my Nokia N-Gage and getting the hell out of here.

497
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:08,840
You're grabbing your diarrhea with a bucket out of the toilet and then you're leaving.

498
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:09,840
That's all you take.

499
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:10,840
Come on.

500
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:12,840
You're leaving your girlfriend and your cats inside and you're taking your diarrhea.

501
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:13,840
No, I'm not.

502
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:14,840
Yeah, you're taking it all the way home.

503
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:16,840
I'm not taking any diarrhea home with me.

504
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:17,840
Yeah, you are.

505
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:22,200
Wait, listen to this comment about being buried alive.

506
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:26,200
Just imagine being in a dark, cold space waiting to die and you keep screaming but no one can

507
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:28,840
hear you and as the hours pass you feel worthless.

508
00:24:28,840 --> 00:24:32,380
It would be like putting a granny in a room, take her off her medication knowing she will

509
00:24:32,380 --> 00:24:36,220
die in a few hours and then shut the door and walk out with the granny knowing what will happen.

510
00:24:36,220 --> 00:24:44,540
I've done that to a granny. You've done a lot of stuff to a granny. Yeah. A Granny Smith.

511
00:24:44,540 --> 00:24:52,220
Yeah, I smoked weed out of a Granny Smith before. Yeah, I smoked weed out of your granny.

512
00:24:52,220 --> 00:24:58,780
No, you didn't. My nana would never let you do that. She's not built for it. My nana smoked

513
00:24:58,780 --> 00:25:00,180
- She smoked weed once in the 70s

514
00:25:00,180 --> 00:25:02,700
and she said that she vomited for three days.

515
00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:03,540
(laughing)

516
00:25:03,540 --> 00:25:05,540
And she said that was the only time she ever smoked weed.

517
00:25:05,540 --> 00:25:07,180
- She's like actually allergic to weed.

518
00:25:07,180 --> 00:25:08,440
- And I don't believe her.

519
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:12,940
- You probably smoked, she probably smoked K2 back then.

520
00:25:12,940 --> 00:25:13,980
- Probably.

521
00:25:13,980 --> 00:25:16,900
I don't know, I think being buried alive,

522
00:25:16,900 --> 00:25:20,980
I don't know, I feel like I'd kill Bill that shit, you know?

523
00:25:20,980 --> 00:25:21,900
- Yeah.

524
00:25:21,900 --> 00:25:23,160
- Or just ring the bell.

525
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:25,620
- Ring the bell?

526
00:25:25,620 --> 00:25:26,440
- Don't they have little bells?

527
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:29,980
- Yeah, the Victorian graveyard bell.

528
00:25:29,980 --> 00:25:31,140
- It's not that hard.

529
00:25:31,140 --> 00:25:32,740
- Yeah, pretty easy.

530
00:25:32,740 --> 00:25:34,540
- They have a bell at the graveyard?

531
00:25:34,540 --> 00:25:35,660
- They have a bell at the graveyard.

532
00:25:35,660 --> 00:25:37,740
You can ring it when dinner's done.

533
00:25:37,740 --> 00:25:39,620
It's pretty big.

534
00:25:39,620 --> 00:25:41,380
That's why they had that bell.

535
00:25:41,380 --> 00:25:42,400
- Yeah.

536
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:44,500
- That's how you got somebody to come dig you up,

537
00:25:44,500 --> 00:25:46,060
is you would ring the bell and they would think,

538
00:25:46,060 --> 00:25:47,460
oh, there's dinner down there.

539
00:25:47,460 --> 00:25:50,020
(laughing)

540
00:25:50,020 --> 00:25:53,100
I guess I'll dig 'em up and see if there's dinner in there.

541
00:25:53,100 --> 00:25:56,300
- Damn, they buried a hibachi chef under the hair.

542
00:25:56,300 --> 00:25:58,540
(laughter)

543
00:25:58,540 --> 00:26:01,080
- Damn, he still had an egg in his hat

544
00:26:01,080 --> 00:26:02,260
when we put him down there.

545
00:26:02,260 --> 00:26:03,660
(laughter)

546
00:26:03,660 --> 00:26:06,020
We need to take him back out.

547
00:26:06,020 --> 00:26:08,380
- Oh, I should've known that there's a tower

548
00:26:08,380 --> 00:26:10,660
of onion rings that were on fire.

549
00:26:10,660 --> 00:26:13,140
- This heroic hibachi chef was saved

550
00:26:13,140 --> 00:26:15,460
during this mass shooting when the bullet

551
00:26:15,460 --> 00:26:18,260
was stopped by the shrimp in his chest pocket.

552
00:26:18,260 --> 00:26:20,500
(laughter)

553
00:26:20,500 --> 00:26:25,380
- I would never be buried alive, though.

554
00:26:25,380 --> 00:26:26,680
This is all true.

555
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:29,080
My friend secretly ate a deep sleep medicine

556
00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:30,900
and she went to sleep for 24 hours.

557
00:26:30,900 --> 00:26:32,720
Then when her family came and thought she was dead

558
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:35,480
and buried her, when she woke, she was buried alive.

559
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:37,560
- And then what happened?

560
00:26:37,560 --> 00:26:38,600
- That's the end of the story.

561
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:40,840
- Then she farted and they all died.

562
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:46,560
- Someone says, I don't agree on this.

563
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:48,760
It's actually quite fun, really.

564
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:49,920
- Whoa.

565
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:50,760
- Twisted crazy.

566
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:52,240
- Fucking psycho.

567
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:53,240
Oh my God.

568
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:59,040
Someone says nothing like a psychopath burying you alive, but psychopath is spelled C-Y-C-O-path.

569
00:26:59,040 --> 00:27:00,540
[laughs]

570
00:27:00,540 --> 00:27:02,540
Psychopath.

571
00:27:02,540 --> 00:27:06,040
This is what happened to my great-grandpa. Died by this on D-Day.

572
00:27:06,040 --> 00:27:08,040
[laughs]

573
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:10,040
Buried alive on D-Day?

574
00:27:10,040 --> 00:27:12,040
I don't believe that.

575
00:27:12,040 --> 00:27:12,940
I believe it, dude.

576
00:27:12,940 --> 00:27:15,940
Imagine waking up in a coffin and you struggle to breathe.

577
00:27:15,940 --> 00:27:19,440
I get claustrophobic, so please, it's no laughing matter.

578
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:23,680
I think being buried alive is definitely one of my worst fears.

579
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:24,720
Really?

580
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:26,800
Now someone's going to do it to me.

581
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:29,680
God damn it.

582
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:30,320
Probably a fan.

583
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:33,920
A fan's going to bury you alive.

584
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:37,360
There's a comment on here that says, "Apparently they used to bury people alive."

585
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:42,160
Okay, this is an open...

586
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:48,000
Invitation for anyone to come bury Pat alive at any time.

587
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:53,000
- If you bury me alive, I will be pissed.

588
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:56,440
I'll be pissed.

589
00:27:56,440 --> 00:27:59,780
- I'm imagining just like a circular coffin.

590
00:27:59,780 --> 00:28:02,560
(laughing)

591
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:04,560
They just fit you in, like a gear.

592
00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:07,980
- Someone comments, this is really scary,

593
00:28:07,980 --> 00:28:10,900
but Five Nights at Freddy's should be number one.

594
00:28:10,900 --> 00:28:13,220
(laughing)

595
00:28:13,220 --> 00:28:14,940
Facts.

596
00:28:14,940 --> 00:28:15,780
Facts.

597
00:28:15,780 --> 00:28:17,480
- Yeah, spitting straight facts.

598
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:22,120
When you're unable to move that's terrible.

599
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:26,520
Not that scary. I would say being buried alive is not my number one fear.

600
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:30,280
In Russia a girl named Sasha was 16 year old and she slept a really long time so

601
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:33,120
her mom and dad thought she was dead. They buried her and then Sasha woke up

602
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:37,040
and said where am I? Wait I'm buried. Help help help please wait I

603
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:41,040
can't breathe. Agh. And 16 minutes later she was dead. She was beautiful.

604
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:42,160
Ariana Grande.

605
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:47,360
- They buried Ariana Grande alive.

606
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:49,960
- Number two, fear.

607
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:51,360
- Whoa.

608
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:52,720
- Fear itself, dude.

609
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:53,720
- Whoa.

610
00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:54,860
- Remember that line?

611
00:28:54,860 --> 00:28:58,560
- Yeah, I remember who said it too, Dracula.

612
00:28:58,560 --> 00:29:02,440
- Yeah, you have nothing to fear but my dragon ass.

613
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:03,280
- No, no, he was trying to trick them.

614
00:29:03,280 --> 00:29:04,100
- Fear but me.

615
00:29:04,100 --> 00:29:05,380
- He was trying to trick them.

616
00:29:05,380 --> 00:29:07,080
He was trying to be like, listen,

617
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:10,840
don't worry about Dracula, you should be afraid of fear.

618
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:13,440
And they were like, "Oh, duh, okay."

619
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:14,440
Well, he's got a point.

620
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:16,440
By the time they realized what was happening,

621
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:18,640
they had two little pencils in their neck.

622
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:19,640
[Scoffs]

623
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:20,640
Top comment.

624
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:22,840
"Fear is scary and is what makes us afraid.

625
00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:26,040
It is the seedling of panic and sets terror into the body.

626
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:28,740
It is the father of phobias and the mother of horror.

627
00:29:28,740 --> 00:29:29,240
It is fear."

628
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:30,040
Father of phobia?

629
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:32,040
"Anna."

630
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:32,940
That's from Anna?

631
00:29:32,940 --> 00:29:34,440
Yeah, that's what it says.

632
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:35,440
Wow.

633
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:37,040
"Anna Bell, the doll?"

634
00:29:37,040 --> 00:29:38,040
[Gasps]

635
00:29:38,040 --> 00:29:38,540
[Screams]

636
00:29:38,540 --> 00:29:39,540
No!

637
00:29:39,540 --> 00:29:41,020
(laughing)

638
00:29:41,020 --> 00:29:41,860
- No!

639
00:29:41,860 --> 00:29:46,300
- That would be so scary if Annabelle DePaul

640
00:29:46,300 --> 00:29:48,100
was a top 10's comment. - I fear being sick or hurt

641
00:29:48,100 --> 00:29:50,520
and no access to healthcare.

642
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:51,860
- Wow, welcome to America.

643
00:29:51,860 --> 00:29:52,700
- Yeah.

644
00:29:52,700 --> 00:29:54,060
- That's a really long comment too.

645
00:29:54,060 --> 00:29:56,760
- Someone says, I bet Ted Cruz won't bring this up.

646
00:29:56,760 --> 00:29:58,940
(laughing)

647
00:29:58,940 --> 00:30:00,140
He got his ass set for life.

648
00:30:00,140 --> 00:30:02,580
- Our nation's biggest problem is fear.

649
00:30:02,580 --> 00:30:06,920
- Poor white stupid, I bet you on free healthcare.

650
00:30:08,180 --> 00:30:10,420
- Four white steps above ground. - This is the biggest one.

651
00:30:10,420 --> 00:30:13,380
Bigger than "Starded" on the ocean because it's fear.

652
00:30:13,380 --> 00:30:15,260
You're scared of being buried alive fear.

653
00:30:15,260 --> 00:30:16,820
Ghosts and Slenderman, fear.

654
00:30:16,820 --> 00:30:19,020
Sometimes you're not gonna like admitting it,

655
00:30:19,020 --> 00:30:22,060
but that's sort of fear mixed with embarrassment.

656
00:30:22,060 --> 00:30:23,660
- Oh wait, we figured out who said the quote.

657
00:30:23,660 --> 00:30:25,940
Somebody got it in the comments.

658
00:30:25,940 --> 00:30:28,900
The only fear is fear itself, Marilyn Manson.

659
00:30:28,900 --> 00:30:31,140
(laughing)

660
00:30:31,140 --> 00:30:35,220
There we go, we got it. - At least you said it, yeah.

661
00:30:35,220 --> 00:30:36,940
- But you nailed it.

662
00:30:36,940 --> 00:30:41,740
The only thing to fear is fear itself. I think this is so true because if there was no fear, there would be nothing to fear.

663
00:30:41,740 --> 00:30:45,680
Holy cow, we blew that one right wide open.

664
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:50,100
Really, fear is the scariest because all the stuff on the list is fear. Fear is the devil's happiness. So yeah.

665
00:30:50,100 --> 00:30:53,340
Fear kinda makes me, uh, happy.

666
00:30:53,340 --> 00:30:55,580
You're a psycho.

667
00:30:55,580 --> 00:30:58,020
I'm kind of, uh,

668
00:30:58,020 --> 00:30:59,020
You're a, uh,

669
00:30:59,020 --> 00:30:59,520
Freak with that.

670
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:01,380
You should be in 21 Pilots.

671
00:31:01,380 --> 00:31:02,080
Mm-hmm.

672
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:03,580
You're a halloween crazy.

673
00:31:03,580 --> 00:31:05,580
I'm just a sucker for pain!

674
00:31:06,620 --> 00:31:07,660
Oh, maybe you are a 21.

675
00:31:07,660 --> 00:31:09,300
It's kind of a 21 Pilots hat.

676
00:31:09,300 --> 00:31:11,220
It's funny that we make fun of this hat every week

677
00:31:11,220 --> 00:31:12,460
and you just keep wearing it.

678
00:31:12,460 --> 00:31:13,860
It's not a bad hat.

679
00:31:13,860 --> 00:31:15,460
Just wear a different hat when we record.

680
00:31:15,460 --> 00:31:16,300
Just change hats or something.

681
00:31:16,300 --> 00:31:17,340
It's a good hat.

682
00:31:17,340 --> 00:31:18,160
It's a good hat.

683
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:21,060
It's not comfortable to wear a hat under headphones too.

684
00:31:21,060 --> 00:31:22,380
I do it all the time.

685
00:31:22,380 --> 00:31:24,080
It makes your head really sore.

686
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:24,920
I don't know why you choose to do it.

687
00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:26,340
Yeah, tell that to Caleb.

688
00:31:26,340 --> 00:31:27,180
Every time.

689
00:31:27,180 --> 00:31:29,360
Well, I mean, Caleb only does it sometimes.

690
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:30,320
That's right.

691
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:31,660
You do it every single time.

692
00:31:31,660 --> 00:31:33,580
I do it all day, every day, man.

693
00:31:33,580 --> 00:31:35,580
I'm afraid of what's under that hat.

694
00:31:35,580 --> 00:31:37,180
And I'm having goosebumps.

695
00:31:37,180 --> 00:31:40,700
That's a comment right there.

696
00:31:40,700 --> 00:31:41,540
I'm having goosebumps right now.

697
00:31:41,540 --> 00:31:45,140
Number three, being stranded in the open ocean.

698
00:31:45,140 --> 00:31:46,060
Whoa.

699
00:31:46,060 --> 00:31:48,480
I just swim away.

700
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:50,580
Can you not swim?

701
00:31:50,580 --> 00:31:52,540
Yeah, just swim to the land.

702
00:31:52,540 --> 00:31:53,580
Do you have no-- I just swim home.

703
00:31:53,580 --> 00:31:54,860
Here's what's scary,

704
00:31:54,860 --> 00:31:58,680
being stranded in the ocean and you're just a head.

705
00:31:58,680 --> 00:32:01,780
And you realize that your body has been taken

706
00:32:01,780 --> 00:32:04,460
by Somali pirates and you're just a floating head

707
00:32:04,460 --> 00:32:05,460
in the ocean. Oh my God.

708
00:32:05,460 --> 00:32:06,740
That might be pretty scary.

709
00:32:06,740 --> 00:32:08,500
But just being straight, I mean, again,

710
00:32:08,500 --> 00:32:10,380
I'm an excellent swimmer.

711
00:32:10,380 --> 00:32:13,740
I placed third place in like two or three

712
00:32:13,740 --> 00:32:14,780
swim competitions growing up.

713
00:32:14,780 --> 00:32:16,460
- Yeah, I was number one in the world

714
00:32:16,460 --> 00:32:18,500
when I was like one year old, so.

715
00:32:18,500 --> 00:32:19,340
- No, you weren't.

716
00:32:19,340 --> 00:32:20,300
- Yeah, I was. - No.

717
00:32:20,300 --> 00:32:21,860
- No. - No.

718
00:32:21,860 --> 00:32:24,900
- I swam around the world in 80 minutes.

719
00:32:24,900 --> 00:32:26,860
- That's a Jackie Chan movie. - I just don't believe you.

720
00:32:26,860 --> 00:32:28,300
- That's not a real thing.

721
00:32:28,300 --> 00:32:30,740
- No, well, they based the movie off of me.

722
00:32:30,740 --> 00:32:31,740
- They did not.

723
00:32:31,740 --> 00:32:32,740
- They did.

724
00:32:32,740 --> 00:32:33,580
- They didn't, no.

725
00:32:33,580 --> 00:32:37,020
So we just heard a one-year-old got an awesome one-year-old guy swam around the

726
00:32:37,020 --> 00:32:39,820
world in 80 minutes we're gonna make a movie where Jackie Chan swims around the

727
00:32:39,820 --> 00:32:42,820
world in 80 minutes and then my family was gonna sue him so they had to change

728
00:32:42,820 --> 00:32:47,620
it to going in a hot air balloon instead and 80 days no they didn't change that

729
00:32:47,620 --> 00:32:50,860
that's a that's a little known misconception that's a mistake that's a

730
00:32:50,860 --> 00:32:55,340
misprint on the DVD yeah cuz I mean yeah they think about it the movies like 80

731
00:32:55,340 --> 00:33:03,540
minutes exactly boost they based they boost they based they based on Wilson

732
00:33:03,540 --> 00:33:10,060
on me they did Cameron's look you're thinking of Shanghai noon no oh and

733
00:33:10,060 --> 00:33:15,460
Wilson is in around the world than 80 days is he yeah I don't think so and

734
00:33:15,460 --> 00:33:20,460
yeah no man you're thinking of um bottle rocket by West you think you're midnight

735
00:33:20,460 --> 00:33:28,080
in Paris yeah no yeah oh that's Jackie Chan and Steve Coogan huh no Owen Wilson

736
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:34,460
Owen Wilson is it in it but he's Wilbur Wright oh so he's not Wilson he's

737
00:33:34,460 --> 00:33:40,660
Wilbur Wright you just said he's not he's not a high noon he's he's I heard a

738
00:33:40,660 --> 00:33:48,940
rumor I heard a rumor that that movie that that someone got Owen Wilson hooked

739
00:33:48,940 --> 00:33:54,420
on heroin on the set of that movie. Around the world in 80 days? Yeah. I guess when

740
00:33:54,420 --> 00:33:57,420
you're a celebrity like you might as well just get addicted to heroin you know?

741
00:33:57,420 --> 00:34:02,340
Right? You got to do it. Like I get it. Allegedly. I just want to say allegedly so

742
00:34:02,340 --> 00:34:07,460
that Owen Wilson a big a friend of the show does not sue us. He's a friend of

743
00:34:07,460 --> 00:34:11,420
the show. He's a friend of me. He's not a friend of the show. He's a friend of the show.

744
00:34:11,420 --> 00:34:16,420
He's a friend of the show. He's not. He's a friend of the show. He's a friend of the show.

745
00:34:16,420 --> 00:34:21,300
He's a friend of the show for someone like me. He will throw up on any boat due to seasickness. I couldn't agree more

746
00:34:21,300 --> 00:34:24,260
I'll just stick to the kiddie pool and the bath toys. Thank you very much

747
00:34:24,260 --> 00:34:29,840
Yeah, I'll swim in my bathtub. It's also they said kiddie pool. KITTY

748
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:35,160
Like the cat pool yeah, yeah kitty cat pool

749
00:34:35,160 --> 00:34:39,400
Okay, I would probably make friends with the sharks and just have them

750
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:46,280
Take me home if I would swim to the bottom of the ocean and that I would find a portal that goes into my house

751
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:53,360
I would tell the sharks I'm kind of like the shark of like humans so we kind of

752
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:57,000
you know we might relate a little bit and they would understand me and they would

753
00:34:57,000 --> 00:35:02,280
take me home. Here's a comment guys if this happens to you watch the shallows

754
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:12,440
first it's a story of a woman gets stranded in a middle island. Oh fuck I'm stuck in the middle of the ocean. Does somebody have an iPod video with the shallow on it?

755
00:35:12,440 --> 00:35:16,420
The shallow she's like she's not even stuck on an island that's the one with

756
00:35:16,420 --> 00:35:21,760
um fucking wait let me is this the one I'm thinking of yeah with Blake Lively

757
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:25,260
she's not stuck on an island she's stuck out she's like stuck is stuck like 50

758
00:35:25,260 --> 00:35:30,980
feet from shore on like a buoy like this isn't even doesn't even apply lean just

759
00:35:30,980 --> 00:35:36,400
lean towards the the ocean or the land well there's a shark just step on him

760
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:42,320
jump on his head Mario style on the shirt you get to bring a coin home what

761
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:45,680
What kind of shark would you ride? What would be whale shark?

762
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:48,160
I would ride the shark from 47 meters down uncaged.

763
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:52,160
I would probably do a hammerhead shark just so I could grab onto the sides like a hammerhead.

764
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:54,640
I would do the megalodon actually. I'm changing my answer.

765
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:56,640
Like a west coast chopper.

766
00:35:56,640 --> 00:36:00,080
Yeah, yeah, hang onto it like a west coast chopper.

767
00:36:00,080 --> 00:36:02,080
Get your motor running.

768
00:36:02,080 --> 00:36:06,080
Shark out on the highway.

769
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:09,680
Eating all the small fish.

770
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:11,680
And whatever comes our way

771
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:15,680
Born to ride a shark

772
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:17,680
Meow meow meow meow

773
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:19,680
My uh, my grandpa

774
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:21,680
This should make wild hogs but with sharks

775
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:23,680
My grandpa used to have like a little, like a plushie of Santa Claus

776
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:25,680
And when you, and he was on a motorcycle

777
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:27,680
And he had like a Harley Davidson jacket

778
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:29,680
And when you pressed his uh

779
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:31,680
If you pressed his hand

780
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:33,680
It would play that song and he would like shake

781
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:35,680
So I used to hide it under the couch cushion

782
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:37,680
So when he would sit down

783
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:42,100
down when he got home from work he'd sit down and he was like get your motor run

784
00:36:42,100 --> 00:36:48,720
you go god fucking damn it the last comment on being stranded in the open

785
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:56,400
ocean is I would die with the smiley emoji okay freak I'm scared of that guy

786
00:36:56,400 --> 00:37:01,820
yeah let's get these I okay with death get him out of there I don't know I

787
00:37:01,820 --> 00:37:07,640
think my video driver just crashed what are you driving I don't know

788
00:37:07,640 --> 00:37:13,440
know something just crashed. Both of my screens just shut off so. Turn them on.

789
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:19,960
Yeah they're playing Skater XL. I'm not playing Skater XL. Thanks for the

790
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:25,960
dramatic gong hit. Yeah. That was the mic stand. Alright anyway.

791
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:29,400
The monitor turned off because you suffered a ghost curse on Halloween.

792
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:35,360
Yeah. Dude you're suffering. I wasn't playing Skater XL but I did look up Owen Wilson's

793
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:41,480
heroin stuff and it turns out Steve Coogan might have be the one who got him hooked on

794
00:37:41,480 --> 00:37:42,480
heroin.

795
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:43,480
He might be the suspect?

796
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:47,920
It says in this New York Post article that Steve Coogan with whom he starred in several

797
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:51,800
films with according blah blah blah I went through it with Steve.

798
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:53,440
That gets the heat off of Jackie.

799
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:54,440
Wow.

800
00:37:54,440 --> 00:37:55,440
I would have thought it was the Chan man.

801
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:56,880
Now that's scary.

802
00:37:56,880 --> 00:38:01,840
Jackie Chan did not get oh Wilson hooked on heroin it was allegedly Steve Coogan.

803
00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:06,480
Jackie Chan was addicted to heroin and he's just like trying to do all the kung fu and

804
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:11,480
his arms are just like going just completely limp as he's trying to punch these guys and

805
00:38:11,480 --> 00:38:14,160
they're all like flipping over as soon as he touches them.

806
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:15,160
Yeah.

807
00:38:15,160 --> 00:38:16,160
That'd be awesome.

808
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:19,080
Look like Jar Jar Binks fighting.

809
00:38:19,080 --> 00:38:20,080
Number four is hell.

810
00:38:20,080 --> 00:38:24,560
I can't even say it.

811
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:25,560
Here's a comment.

812
00:38:25,560 --> 00:38:30,800
I don't believe, this is the second week in a row we've talked about hell I think.

813
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:34,080
This is a comment though, um, I don't believe in hell.

814
00:38:34,080 --> 00:38:37,500
If there is an afterlife in anything, there won't be any punishment and people suffer

815
00:38:37,500 --> 00:38:38,780
more than on earth.

816
00:38:38,780 --> 00:38:41,000
More likely to be a reincarnation are ghosts.

817
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:44,580
This sounds really stupid, but if ghosts exist, maybe the reason why no one has seen them

818
00:38:44,580 --> 00:38:48,080
is because it's the souls of humans and it's the ghosts of people.

819
00:38:48,080 --> 00:38:52,660
In government that passed away, they threw Adolf Hitler into a cave and have some laws

820
00:38:52,660 --> 00:38:56,000
you cannot haunt someone's house.

821
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:59,440
You guys ever think the afterlife might be like that?

822
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:00,440
Do you think they have laws?

823
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:03,480
Do you guys think that it might be the souls of humans and the ghosts of people in government

824
00:39:03,480 --> 00:39:06,840
they threw Adolf Hitler into a cave and have laws that you can't haunt someone's house?

825
00:39:06,840 --> 00:39:09,800
In hell, in hell they would have a million laws.

826
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:10,800
That's true.

827
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:11,800
Holy crap.

828
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:12,800
What would hell be like?

829
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:16,960
A million laws and no TV.

830
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:17,960
Oh my god.

831
00:39:17,960 --> 00:39:18,960
No TV for a week.

832
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:22,800
No TV because of how many laws regulated it.

833
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:26,280
That's right.

834
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:29,200
And you wouldn't be able to cross the street.

835
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:33,520
can't watch Superstore. You can't ever cross the street to go to the store. You can't watch Superstore at all.

836
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:39,000
You can't watch Superstore even in the old episodes. No. Yeah. No. And they say,

837
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:43,720
they say, you say, "Do you guys have Mr. Show?" and they're like, "Oh yeah, yeah we

838
00:39:43,720 --> 00:39:47,080
have Mr. Show. It's like one of the few shows we have." And then you turn it on

839
00:39:47,080 --> 00:39:51,720
and it's with Bob and David. Yep. Turns out it's actually Sister Show and it's

840
00:39:51,720 --> 00:39:57,720
the all-female reboot. No. Oh my god. Yeah. And it's Elijah Schlesinger. Only in hell.

841
00:39:57,720 --> 00:40:09,360
that's only on hell TV yeah I want to go to hell that's how they get you dude

842
00:40:09,360 --> 00:40:13,600
that's how they trick you they have a byway exclusive TV shows I would do I

843
00:40:13,600 --> 00:40:19,240
would do fixer-upper to hell yeah I would put in like some nice wood floors I would

844
00:40:19,240 --> 00:40:24,800
put in a is that no I'm thinking of I think is that chip and Joanna chip and

845
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:25,960
- Chip and Joanne.

846
00:40:25,960 --> 00:40:28,080
Yeah, I would go Chip and Joanne on Hell.

847
00:40:28,080 --> 00:40:29,040
- Joanna.

848
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:29,880
- It's not Joanna.

849
00:40:29,880 --> 00:40:31,220
- Get her name right.

850
00:40:31,220 --> 00:40:32,060
It's Chip and Joanna.

851
00:40:32,060 --> 00:40:32,900
- You don't even know what the show is called.

852
00:40:32,900 --> 00:40:33,720
- Yes it is.

853
00:40:33,720 --> 00:40:34,560
- It's Chip and Dale.

854
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:35,400
- Yes it is.

855
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:37,320
- Chip and Dale and they're two chip monks.

856
00:40:37,320 --> 00:40:39,080
- Chip and Joanna Gaines.

857
00:40:39,080 --> 00:40:40,340
- No, wrong.

858
00:40:40,340 --> 00:40:41,440
- That's their name.

859
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:42,540
- That's her formal name.

860
00:40:42,540 --> 00:40:44,760
When you know her and her husband well,

861
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:46,920
they let you call her Jo.

862
00:40:46,920 --> 00:40:49,160
So Chip and Jo, I'm taking them to Hell.

863
00:40:49,160 --> 00:40:51,380
We're putting in granite countertops.

864
00:40:51,380 --> 00:40:52,220
We're gonna cover up.

865
00:40:52,220 --> 00:40:53,040
- We're gonna get some nice,

866
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:54,680
we're gonna get some beautiful magnolia.

867
00:40:54,680 --> 00:40:58,680
We're putting an in-ground fire pool.

868
00:40:58,680 --> 00:41:00,180
Oh, hell yeah.

869
00:41:00,180 --> 00:41:03,180
Because they have an above-ground one and it's kind of tacky.

870
00:41:03,180 --> 00:41:04,680
Yeah.

871
00:41:04,680 --> 00:41:07,180
Yeah, the thing is you get a lot of bang for your buck in hell.

872
00:41:07,180 --> 00:41:08,680
Yep.

873
00:41:08,680 --> 00:41:10,680
It's made out of stones.

874
00:41:10,680 --> 00:41:11,680
Brimstones.

875
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:13,680
Whoa.

876
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:15,180
That's right.

877
00:41:15,180 --> 00:41:17,180
Here's a sub-list in the comments.

878
00:41:17,180 --> 00:41:19,680
What's going to happen if Satan rules the world?

879
00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:22,180
One, the opposite of heaven is hell.

880
00:41:22,180 --> 00:41:23,180
I would hate that.

881
00:41:23,180 --> 00:41:27,180
2. No peace and quiet, just noise and screams.

882
00:41:27,180 --> 00:41:30,180
3. Endless torture.

883
00:41:30,180 --> 00:41:35,180
4. Satan will make you hungry and lets you feed human organs.

884
00:41:35,180 --> 00:41:46,180
5. No more anything you like in your life. Ever.

885
00:41:46,180 --> 00:41:51,900
Oh my god, did he see I I would seriously fucking hate that. Yeah

Yeah, Satan rules.

914
00:44:25,660 --> 00:44:30,280

- See, again, I would make friends

922
00:44:42,700 --> 00:44:45,880

975
00:47:14,980 --> 00:47:22,220
kid when I was a kid I I thought I invented eternal breathing and I because

976
00:47:22,220 --> 00:47:29,260
I had a Capri Sun with the straw and I was like, "Oh my God, what if I just put air in

977
00:47:29,260 --> 00:47:35,020
the Capri Sun and then I just breathe it in and out and in and out while I'm underwater?"

978
00:47:35,020 --> 00:47:41,620
And so it went underwater and I just started doing it and then I like got out and climbed

979
00:47:41,620 --> 00:47:45,180
onto the dock and I was like, "I'm about to pass out."

980
00:47:45,180 --> 00:47:50,460
I told my brother, I was like, "I think I invented forever breathing."

981
00:47:50,460 --> 00:47:52,960
And he was like, "If you do that anymore, you'll die."

982
00:47:52,960 --> 00:47:54,760
(laughing)

983
00:47:54,760 --> 00:47:55,800
It's heartbreaking, dude.

984
00:47:55,800 --> 00:47:57,300
- Here's a crazy-- - Here's one of my early

985
00:47:57,300 --> 00:48:00,700
forays into science and the scientific method, actually.

986
00:48:00,700 --> 00:48:03,260
- Here's a crazy comment.

987
00:48:03,260 --> 00:48:07,180
I once drowned from OddGuy31.

988
00:48:07,180 --> 00:48:08,180
- Oh my God.

989
00:48:08,180 --> 00:48:09,780
- That's why he's so odd.

990
00:48:09,780 --> 00:48:12,100
- You can drown and not die.

991
00:48:12,100 --> 00:48:12,940
- Yeah.

992
00:48:12,940 --> 00:48:14,540
- You can drown as long as, I think,

993
00:48:14,540 --> 00:48:16,340
I wonder what is the line where they're like,

994
00:48:16,340 --> 00:48:18,740
okay, you're officially drowning.

995
00:48:18,740 --> 00:48:20,660
now I'll come save you.

996
00:48:20,660 --> 00:48:21,500
- Yeah.

997
00:48:21,500 --> 00:48:23,060
- You know, like what is the--

998
00:48:23,060 --> 00:48:25,060
- It's three dunks, it's three dunks.

999
00:48:25,060 --> 00:48:26,860
- Yeah, three dunks.

1000
00:48:26,860 --> 00:48:28,060
- Like--

1001
00:48:28,060 --> 00:48:29,580
- Up and down three times.

1002
00:48:29,580 --> 00:48:30,420
- Yeah.

1003
00:48:30,420 --> 00:48:31,660
- And you're drowning?

1004
00:48:31,660 --> 00:48:32,500
- Uh-huh.

1005
00:48:32,500 --> 00:48:33,580
- It's if you turn blue like water,

1006
00:48:33,580 --> 00:48:36,140
'cause you can see the water through your skin.

1007
00:48:36,140 --> 00:48:39,060
- Oh, that's why you turn blue when you're drowning.

1008
00:48:39,060 --> 00:48:39,900
- Yeah.

1009
00:48:39,900 --> 00:48:42,380
- Because your skin is water.

1010
00:48:42,380 --> 00:48:44,660

00:49:25,600 --> 00:49:26,200
If you don't know them.

1027
00:49:26,200 --> 00:49:27,200
So.

1028
00:49:27,200 --> 00:49:28,600
Um, so...

1029
00:49:28,600 --> 00:49:29,500
Here's a comment.

1030
00:49:29,500 --> 00:49:30,000
I...

1031
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:33,200
Just... let's... let's try to figure out what this comment means.

1032
00:49:33,200 --> 00:49:36,600
Amanda Joy DeRidder is the scariest thing forever,

1033
00:49:36,600 --> 00:49:37,600
the worst thing forever,

1034
00:49:37,600 --> 00:49:39,100
and the most painful thing forever.

1035
00:49:39,100 --> 00:49:42,000
Amanda Joy DeRidder is unknown forever and not real forever.

1036
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:44,400
We are saved by God from Amanda Joy DeRidder.

- Work meetings. - Work meetings.

1059
00:50:37,160 --> 00:50:38,240
If you could travel back in time

1061
00:50:39,640 --> 00:50:41,000

00:50:45,640 --> 00:50:47,680
- The Civil War. - 26 to 40.

1065
00:50:47,680 --> 00:50:50,900
- Do you regret anything you've done in your life?

1066
00:50:50,900 --> 00:50:52,080
Yes, I've made a lot of mistakes.

1067
00:50:52,080 --> 00:50:53,080
I regret some things.

1068
00:50:53,080 --> 00:50:54,260
I try not to regret anything.

1069
00:50:54,260 --> 00:50:55,960
No, the past made me who I am today.

1070
00:50:55,960 --> 00:50:57,040
- I regret going-- - Yes, I have a lot

1071
00:50:57,040 --> 00:50:58,840
of regrets. - I regret going back

1072
00:50:58,840 --> 00:51:02,660
to the Civil War and accidentally joining the wrong side.

1073
00:51:02,660 --> 00:51:04,480
- Would you rather be rich or in poor health

1074
00:51:04,480 --> 00:51:07,080
or healthy but poor? (laughs)

1075
00:51:07,080 --> 00:51:08,360
- Why can't I be healthy and rich?

1076
00:51:08,360 --> 00:51:09,880
- Rich and in poor health, healthy but poor.

1077
00:51:09,880 --> 00:51:12,220
Why can't I be healthy and rich?

1078
00:51:12,220 --> 00:51:13,620
Why can't I be healthy and rich?

1079
00:51:13,620 --> 00:51:14,720
- Yeah, that's a good question.

1080
00:51:14,720 --> 00:51:16,460
- Are you currently in a committed relationship?

1081
00:51:16,460 --> 00:51:17,380
Yes, and it's great.

1082
00:51:17,380 --> 00:51:18,740
No, and I'm not happy about it.

1083
00:51:18,740 --> 00:51:19,640
Yes, but it's shaky.

1084
00:51:19,640 --> 00:51:21,140
No, and I'm okay with it.

1085
00:51:21,140 --> 00:51:22,540
- No, and I'm okay with it.

1086
00:51:22,540 --> 00:51:26,040
- Would you consider yourself to be more of an introvert

1087
00:51:26,040 --> 00:51:26,880
or an extrovert?

1088
00:51:26,880 --> 00:51:28,900
- A little bit of both. - Or a little of both?

1089
00:51:28,900 --> 00:51:30,540
Are you taking it at the same time, Patrick?

1090
00:51:30,540 --> 00:51:31,940
- Yeah.

1091
00:51:31,940 --> 00:51:33,380
- What is your favorite genre of music?

1092
00:51:33,380 --> 00:51:36,540
Indie/alternative, R&B, country, folk, or pop?

1093
00:51:36,540 --> 00:51:38,780
- I like anything but rap and country.

1094
00:51:38,780 --> 00:51:40,540
- Yeah, so folk and pop then.

1095
00:51:40,540 --> 00:51:42,340
- Yeah, let's choose folk.

1096
00:51:42,340 --> 00:51:43,900
What was your greatest fear as a child?

1097
00:51:43,900 --> 00:51:45,260
Well, I mean, that's kinda--

1098
00:51:45,260 --> 00:51:46,620
- School.

1099
00:51:46,620 --> 00:51:48,860
- Country and rap music.

1100
00:51:48,860 --> 00:51:50,660
- What do you believe is the most important thing in life?

1101
00:51:50,660 --> 00:51:53,240
Money, family, contentment, love, or career?

1102
00:51:53,240 --> 00:51:54,260
- Contentment.

1103
00:51:54,260 --> 00:51:55,220
- Yeah.

1104
00:51:55,220 --> 00:51:56,500
Do you consider yourself to be a religious

1105
00:51:56,500 --> 00:51:57,420
or spiritual person? - No.

1106
00:51:57,420 --> 00:51:59,080
- Yes, no, or I'm not sure?

1107
00:51:59,080 --> 00:52:00,500
- I'm not sure anymore.

1108
00:52:00,500 --> 00:52:01,820
After this list. - All right, here's

1109
00:52:01,820 --> 00:52:03,000
calculating our result.

1110
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:05,840
Calculating.

1111
00:52:05,840 --> 00:52:08,660
Change.

1112
00:52:08,660 --> 00:52:10,060
- Mine says failure. - Wow.

1113
00:52:10,060 --> 00:52:10,900
(laughing)

1114
00:52:10,900 --> 00:52:11,720
- Where's the--

1115
00:52:11,720 --> 00:52:12,560
- You failed the quiz.

1116
00:52:12,560 --> 00:52:13,620
- I failed the test.

1117
00:52:13,620 --> 00:52:16,140
- You picked the wrong answers, dude.

1118
00:52:16,140 --> 00:52:16,980
- I failed the test.

1119
00:52:16,980 --> 00:52:19,760
- I thought it was gonna say something about this weird name.

1120
00:52:19,760 --> 00:52:20,600
- No.

1121
00:52:20,600 --> 00:52:21,420
- No, where is that coming from?

1122
00:52:21,420 --> 00:52:24,100
- You thought it was gonna unlock the secret?

1123
00:52:24,100 --> 00:52:24,940
- I don't think we can unlock the secret.

1124
00:52:24,940 --> 00:52:26,060
- Is there like a comment section?

1125
00:52:26,060 --> 00:52:28,600
- I thought it was like a Cicada 3301 thing

1126
00:52:28,600 --> 00:52:31,780
and we were gonna get into the secret society.

1127
00:52:31,780 --> 00:52:34,940
- Let's see, let's search it with quotes.

1128
00:52:34,940 --> 00:52:37,100
Yeah, no, it looks like it, I don't know.

1129
00:52:37,100 --> 00:52:39,540
It came up on another paid website

1130
00:52:39,540 --> 00:52:42,060
It says, "What is the scariest thing?"

1131
00:52:42,060 --> 00:52:42,900
Weird, dude.

1132
00:52:42,900 --> 00:52:43,940
Somebody on the, somebody,

1133
00:52:43,940 --> 00:52:46,020
one of the fans figured this out for us.

1134
00:52:46,020 --> 00:52:46,860
Yeah.

1135
00:52:46,860 --> 00:52:49,080
Find out who Amanda Joy DeRidder is.

1136
00:52:49,080 --> 00:52:50,020
Yeah.

1137
00:52:50,020 --> 00:52:51,820
And if she's single.

1138
00:52:51,820 --> 00:52:52,940
(laughs)

1139
00:52:52,940 --> 00:52:54,420
If she's single.

1140
00:52:54,420 --> 00:52:55,260
Mm-hmm.

1141
00:52:55,260 --> 00:52:57,020
Ghosts are totally in my life.

1142
00:52:57,020 --> 00:52:59,060
Hello, I read your name on a list.

1143
00:52:59,060 --> 00:53:01,300
I was wondering if you're single.

1144
00:53:01,300 --> 00:53:02,540
I read your name and it called you

1145
00:53:02,540 --> 00:53:04,420
the scariest thing of all time.

1146
00:53:04,420 --> 00:53:07,460
Uh, what's up with you?

1147
00:53:07,460 --> 00:53:09,280
Caleb Michael Derrider.

1148
00:53:09,280 --> 00:53:11,380
- Derrider. - He's gotta redo it.

1149
00:53:11,380 --> 00:53:12,220
- Derrider.

1150
00:53:12,220 --> 00:53:13,120
- Ghosts are totally real.

1151
00:53:13,120 --> 00:53:15,300
I have seen one once, aspiration once,

1152
00:53:15,300 --> 00:53:18,200
and orbs energy, black, clear, green, I should be yellow.

1153
00:53:18,200 --> 00:53:21,060
It happens to a hobby of mine and I'm not scared one bit.

1154
00:53:21,060 --> 00:53:23,480
If I saw one again, they are just earthbound spirits

1155
00:53:23,480 --> 00:53:25,660
that are in limbo, lost after a murder or suicide

1156
00:53:25,660 --> 00:53:27,540
and trying to communicate and everyone gets scared.

1157
00:53:27,540 --> 00:53:29,140
They're not scary, they used to be like us,

1158
00:53:29,140 --> 00:53:30,780
but now they're on another plane.

1159
00:53:30,780 --> 00:53:33,660
That's true as hell.

1160
00:53:33,660 --> 00:53:35,420
- Getting a little philosophical.

1161
00:53:35,420 --> 00:53:36,380
- Yeah.

1162
00:53:36,380 --> 00:53:38,940
Yeah, we should get a little, let's get scarier.

1163
00:53:38,940 --> 00:53:43,100
Death, not very scary.

1164
00:53:43,100 --> 00:53:43,940
Yeah.

1165
00:53:43,940 --> 00:53:45,660
You know, it's not much to me, you know.

1166
00:53:45,660 --> 00:53:47,140
Number eight, clowns.

1167
00:53:47,140 --> 00:53:49,460
Now that's fucking, yeah.

1168
00:53:49,460 --> 00:53:51,500
I can't sleep, clowns will get me.

1169
00:53:51,500 --> 00:53:52,660
Here's a comment.

1170
00:53:52,660 --> 00:53:55,180
This particular clown is the reason I hate them.

1171
00:53:55,180 --> 00:53:57,660
I'm not afraid of them, or at least anymore,

1172
00:53:57,660 --> 00:54:00,900
when I was a little freaked out, me more than Satan.

1173
00:54:00,900 --> 00:54:03,460
But they do make me sweat a lot.

1174
00:54:03,460 --> 00:54:08,180
And I think I'm somewhat traumatized by Pennywise from Bon Jovi 17.

1175
00:54:08,180 --> 00:54:08,680
[laughs]

1176
00:54:08,680 --> 00:54:11,620
Whoa.

1177
00:54:11,620 --> 00:54:12,120
Wow.

1178
00:54:12,120 --> 00:54:12,620
[laughs]

1179
00:54:12,620 --> 00:54:15,820
John Bon Jovi saw Pennywise the Clown

1180
00:54:15,820 --> 00:54:17,940
When he was 17.

1181
00:54:17,940 --> 00:54:21,460
And he got so scared that he wrote the song "Run Away"

1182
00:54:21,460 --> 00:54:21,960
[laughs]

1183
00:54:21,960 --> 00:54:24,100
Because he wanted to run away from the clown.

1184
00:54:24,100 --> 00:54:26,220
He was thinking about running away from a clown.

1185
00:54:26,220 --> 00:54:26,720
Uh-huh.

1186
00:54:26,720 --> 00:54:27,500
That's a good point.

1187
00:54:27,500 --> 00:54:31,900
Once, a clown sang me "Happy Birthday" and just now I have realized how scary they are.

1188
00:54:31,900 --> 00:54:36,060
If that clown would sing me happy birthday, I think I'm gonna be terrified for the rest of my life.

1189
00:54:36,060 --> 00:54:44,060
I do remember a clown when I was a kid, a clown at a circus handing me a caramel apple.

1190
00:54:44,060 --> 00:54:51,740
And I don't know if there's anything scarier than that.

1191
00:54:51,740 --> 00:54:53,500
Yeah, that's so scary.

1192
00:54:53,500 --> 00:54:57,420
You know, there's no way he was licensed to do that.

1193
00:54:57,420 --> 00:55:03,820
Listen to this one. When I was five, I had a Black Friday. I went to a circus. I loved clowns,

1194
00:55:03,820 --> 00:55:08,220
but then the clown got my hand and looked at me. He grabbed me and then done some tricks.

1195
00:55:08,220 --> 00:55:13,420
I was so scared that he even looked at me creepily. I screamed hat day. I couldn't sleep.

1196
00:55:13,420 --> 00:55:18,860
He had a Black Friday. Oh my God. That is terrifying.

1197
00:55:18,860 --> 00:55:23,340
What are the top 10 scariest clowns ever? Number one, gotta be Panty Wise.

Bobo Bobo Bozo. Cheech and Chong are some pretty scary clowns. True. When they get too high.

1205
00:56:09,100 --> 00:56:13,500
Get over here I'm gonna Cheech your Chong. Don't Cheech, hey man don't Cheech my Chong.

1206
00:56:13,500 --> 00:56:15,540
I'm gonna cheat you with Chongsun.

1207
00:56:15,540 --> 00:56:19,360
Don't cheat by Chong. That's right.

1208
00:56:19,360 --> 00:56:23,680
And then number 10, Cameron.

1209
00:56:23,680 --> 00:56:24,520
That's not true.

1210
00:56:24,520 --> 00:56:26,360
Number nine is Lost in Space.

1211
00:56:26,360 --> 00:56:28,280
Oh, I see you.

1212
00:56:28,280 --> 00:56:29,360
I thought you were skipping ahead on the list.

1213
00:56:29,360 --> 00:56:31,280
No, Lost in Space would not be scary to me.

1214
00:56:31,280 --> 00:56:32,200
I just, you know.

1215
00:56:32,200 --> 00:56:34,960
I'd meet an alien and I'd invent technology with them.

1216
00:56:34,960 --> 00:56:35,800
That's what I was born to do.

1217
00:56:35,800 --> 00:56:38,000
I'd meet like four goofy robots

1218
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:39,560
and I'd sit around watching movies with them.

1219
00:56:39,560 --> 00:56:40,960
I go to Planet Cybertron

1220
00:56:40,960 --> 00:56:43,080
and I would pilot Optimus Prime's sun.

1221
00:56:43,080 --> 00:56:46,680
- If I got lost in space?

1222
00:56:46,680 --> 00:56:47,600
- Yeah.

1223
00:56:47,600 --> 00:56:49,780
- Probably just eat some astronaut food.

1224
00:56:49,780 --> 00:56:51,100
- Yeah.

1225
00:56:51,100 --> 00:56:54,000
I'd eat frozen mashed potatoes.

1226
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:56,640
I'd eat frozen mashed potatoes

1227
00:56:56,640 --> 00:56:57,820
and I would spit them out of my mouth

1228
00:56:57,820 --> 00:57:00,800
to make myself fly back to Earth like I'm a rocket.

1229
00:57:00,800 --> 00:57:01,760
- Oh, true.

1230
00:57:01,760 --> 00:57:03,320
I'd use a fire extinguisher

1231
00:57:03,320 --> 00:57:05,960
and I'd propel myself directly into the sun.

1232
00:57:05,960 --> 00:57:07,840
- Yeah, but you'd use the fire extinguisher

1233
00:57:07,840 --> 00:57:10,280
and you'd put out the sun by accident.

1234
00:57:10,280 --> 00:57:15,080
and you'd kill everyone. Yeah just my fucking luck. Yeah and I come back with like a tiny

1235
00:57:15,080 --> 00:57:21,640
black rock and they're like what's that? It's the sun. Sorry. You use a fire extinguisher

1236
00:57:21,640 --> 00:57:25,520
to propel yourself toward the sun and then you hit it and it like flips and it's just

1237
00:57:25,520 --> 00:57:31,480
like it's been a cardboard cutout all along just floating in space. Yeah there's a guy

1238
00:57:31,480 --> 00:57:33,880
Is it like an old man projectionist behind it?

1239
00:57:33,880 --> 00:57:34,880
Yeah.

1240
00:57:34,880 --> 00:57:36,880
Well, guess I'm calling it.

1241
00:57:36,880 --> 00:57:37,880
Ah, geez.

1242
00:57:37,880 --> 00:57:38,880
Well, that's me then.

1243
00:57:38,880 --> 00:57:39,880
Yeah.

1244
00:57:39,880 --> 00:57:40,880
Well, there's my cue.

1245
00:57:40,880 --> 00:57:41,880
All right, well, I'm gonna head out.

1246
00:57:41,880 --> 00:57:42,880
Boss ain't gonna be too happy about this one.

1247
00:57:42,880 --> 00:57:43,880
Well, wait, wait, it's your turn.

1248
00:57:43,880 --> 00:57:44,880
Come take over.

1249
00:57:44,880 --> 00:57:45,880
Yeah.

1250
00:57:45,880 --> 00:57:46,880
Number 10, burning alive.

1251
00:57:46,880 --> 00:57:47,880
Whatever, man.

1252
00:57:47,880 --> 00:57:48,880
I was gonna say, I'm gonna go with number 10.

1253
00:57:48,880 --> 00:57:49,880
I'm gonna go with number 10.

1254
00:57:49,880 --> 00:57:50,880
I'm gonna go with number 10.

1255
00:57:50,880 --> 00:57:51,880
I'm gonna go with number 10.

1256
00:57:51,880 --> 00:57:52,880
I'm gonna go with number 10.

1257
00:57:52,880 --> 00:57:53,880
I'm gonna go with number 10.

1258
00:57:53,880 --> 00:57:54,880
I'm gonna go with number 10.

1259
00:57:54,880 --> 00:57:55,880
I'm gonna go with number 10.

1260
00:57:55,880 --> 00:57:56,880
I'm gonna go with number 10.

1261
00:57:56,880 --> 00:58:00,400
Number 10 burning alive.

1262
00:58:00,400 --> 00:58:03,400
Whatever man, I would wear fireproof clothes and a whole suit.

1263
00:58:03,400 --> 00:58:05,000
I would just stop and roll.

1264
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:06,680
I would pour water on myself.

1265
00:58:06,680 --> 00:58:08,440
There's like a thousand solutions to this one.

1266
00:58:08,440 --> 00:58:09,920
It's impossible to be scared by.

1267
00:58:09,920 --> 00:58:12,720
If I started burning alive I would just die.

1268
00:58:12,720 --> 00:58:13,720
So I'd be burning dead.

1269
00:58:13,720 --> 00:58:14,720
That's brave.

1270
00:58:14,720 --> 00:58:15,720
Uh huh.

1271
00:58:15,720 --> 00:58:16,720
Yeah.

1272
00:58:16,720 --> 00:58:20,360
Would you kill yourself while you were burning alive so that you wouldn't have to die for

1273
00:58:20,360 --> 00:58:21,360
burning alive?

1274
00:58:21,360 --> 00:58:22,360
Maybe.

1275
00:58:22,360 --> 00:58:27,360
Also, I wonder how much time it takes when you're burning alive until you die for real.

1276
00:58:27,360 --> 00:58:29,360
Like, uh, hmm.

1277
00:58:29,360 --> 00:58:35,360
Uh, well I know that in stunt, when you're doing a stunt for a movie,

1278
00:58:35,360 --> 00:58:40,360
you can only do a full body burn for 30 seconds before it starts to do damage to you.

1279
00:58:40,360 --> 00:58:46,360
But that's like if you're wearing like an anti-flammable suit or something.

1280
00:58:46,360 --> 00:58:49,360
I should ask that monk who burned alive.

1281
00:58:49,360 --> 00:58:54,320
Yeah, hey man, I should call he's still he's still burning. Yeah. Yeah, he's still pretty

1282
00:58:54,320 --> 00:59:02,880
Yeah, he's like it's it's like the tomb of the unknown soldier like people just kind of rage against the machine visits him once a year

1283
00:59:02,880 --> 00:59:05,440
Yeah, I give him his royalties

1284
00:59:05,440 --> 00:59:10,680
That's why he did it. He wanted to be on the cover of a rage against the machine. Yeah

1285
00:59:10,680 --> 00:59:13,640
Yeah

1286
00:59:13,640 --> 00:59:15,960
Slender man

1287
00:59:16,720 --> 00:59:18,720
Now we're getting the really scary stuff

1288
00:59:18,720 --> 00:59:30,600
Centerman is scary. No definitely. So no man is definitely scary not to me a guy with no face

1289
00:59:30,600 --> 00:59:32,720
You're a man who you can't kiss

1290
00:59:32,720 --> 00:59:35,560

00:59:35,560 --> 00:59:41,040

This is the shortest or the scariest story you can write in one two, three, four, five six seven eight nine ten

1302
01:00:32,220 --> 01:00:34,600
