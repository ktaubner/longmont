25
00:01:16,100 --> 00:01:21,140
Like a dog when you leave the camera we start tearing up all the pillows in our rooms. Yeah.

26
00:01:21,140 --> 00:01:26,140
shitting on the floor. I had a dream last night that they think that they think they're ripping

exist is that no ghost has ever gone to the news yeah and yeah I've been like

34

00:02:11,020 --> 00:02:16,540
Can I get a sitcom? Can I have a show with Casper? Can we bring Casper into the set?

37
00:02:16,540 --> 00:02:19,400

38
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:21,460

You're thinking of Play-Doh.

Did you guys see what fans of Red Scare said on there?

00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:14,800
It was somebody who said that they liked us but they hate the podcast.

88
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:17,800
That's just like fat gay guys who think they're skinny.

00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:20,600
Posting on the red-

90
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:22,600
Yeah, why do you think I was reading that?

91
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:24,600
Patrick and Patrick clicked on it.

92
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:30,200
Patrick saw that link and he went "Spill the tea, honey" and he clicked on it.

93
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:32,200
Spill the tea, sis.

94
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:36,200
If you're over 260 pounds, don't even call me.

95
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:39,200
Meanwhile, they're 220.

96
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:42,560
No, they're exactly 260.

97
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:47,600
They're exactly 260 and they're like, "Anybody who's bigger than me is humongously fat."

98
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:49,560
Like me right now with this pillow in my shirt.

99
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:50,960
Why don't I do this more?

100
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:52,520
I haven't done this since I was 17.

101
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:54,520
Why don't I do this?

102
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:56,960
You were doing that at 17?

103
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:57,960
Yeah, dude.

104
00:04:57,960 --> 00:04:58,960
It was really funny.

105
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:03,440
You put the pillow in your shirt and you tell the teacher like, "Oh, no.

106
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:05,600
I have a stomach ache right now.

107
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:06,600
Oh, God.

108
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:09,160
I ate too much food at lunch.

109
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:12,760
I ate something nasty, I have to go home now.

110
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:13,760
Oh no I'm fat!

111
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:15,000
Why are you talking in that voice?

112
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,480
You weren't talking like that before.

113
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:17,480
It's Taco Tuesday!

114
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:23,280
I ate a taco Tuesday, I think it was a bad meal.

115
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:24,280
You just get in trouble.

116
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:26,800
You just get in trouble for racism.

117
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:30,200
You don't even get to go home.

118
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:33,400
Oh no, I turn racist!

119
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:34,400
Oh no!

120
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:38,160
The food at the cafeteria made me racist.

121
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:39,720
Oh god damn.

122
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:41,720
I need to be educated.

123
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:48,640
One of the best feelings ever was when I broke my foot on the soccer field as a kid.

124
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:50,240
Seems like a pretty bad feeling to me.

125
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:51,680
Yeah, that's not a good feeling.

126
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:54,080
Trust me, that was one of the worst feelings ever.

127
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:58,760
The best feeling ever was my teacher didn't believe me and she was like, "Just walk it

128
00:05:58,760 --> 00:05:59,760
off."

129
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:03,160
And then the next day I came with a full cast on my leg.

130
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:22,120
just like yeah that was one of the best feeling your teacher just starts saying

131
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:27,300
that she like tries to take your cast off she's saying you're doing it for

132
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:35,900
attention really she was a little bit skeptical even after I came with the

133
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:39,820
cat that's the funniest type of teacher is the one that like hates a fucking

134
00:06:39,820 --> 00:06:43,500
student this is a tough teacher yeah yeah who's done it for like three years

135
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:48,300
and it's like yeah I'm a I'm a veteran yeah the best kind of teacher is like

136
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:53,060
the 27 year old teachers and nurses are such a such a bullshit job where they

137
00:06:53,060 --> 00:06:58,760
they pretend that they served in the military seriously dude yeah I'm sorry

138
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:07,060
that you have to like buy your own supplies yeah they have to military to

139
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:11,660
yeah you think to go to the why do you think army surplus stores exist exactly

140
00:07:11,660 --> 00:07:15,780
because there's a surplus of all their shit you know what you all right all

141
00:07:15,780 --> 00:07:21,380
right here's the okay here is the solution ready this is gonna change the

142
00:07:21,380 --> 00:07:29,340
world yeah change it so what if we convince whoever the bait the whoever

143
00:07:29,340 --> 00:07:34,420
this in charge of the military William Barr if that's him that's what he does

144
00:07:34,420 --> 00:07:43,660
yeah Roseanne bar Vince him that Isis hates school supplies Wow yeah so then

145
00:07:43,660 --> 00:07:48,020
the army surplus stores get filled with like Ticonderoga pencils and shit and

146
00:07:48,020 --> 00:07:53,860
then teachers can go to the army surplus stores and then just get those so we

147
00:07:53,860 --> 00:07:59,600
have a surplus of pencils. You are one of the smartest people in the United States. That is pretty smart yeah yeah but they would still have to

148
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:05,860
buy them yeah no they still have to buy the wrong stuff. So nothing changes. But we have a surplus of it.

149
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:09,940
But you they can also get a cool camo jacket for playing paintball.

150
00:08:09,940 --> 00:08:11,940
wall while they're getting pencils.

151
00:08:11,940 --> 00:08:22,300
If the army found out that ISIS hated school supplies, then they would start selling guns

152
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:25,820
to school supplies and then school supplies would become a new terrorist group.

153
00:08:25,820 --> 00:08:28,020
Just a little bit of political humor for the episode.

154
00:08:28,020 --> 00:08:29,020
Wow.

155
00:08:29,020 --> 00:08:30,020
Wow, that's huge.

156
00:08:30,020 --> 00:08:33,020
Yeah, now we can go back and talk about the other part of it.

157
00:08:33,020 --> 00:08:35,620
But I just wanted to make sure we got a little bit of knowledge in there too.

158
00:08:35,620 --> 00:08:37,020
Now let's do Bolivia.

159
00:08:37,020 --> 00:08:38,020
Okay, Bolivia.

160
00:08:38,020 --> 00:08:39,420

*laughs*

165
00:08:48,620 --> 00:08:50,620
There's a town in North Carolina called Bolivia

166
00:08:50,620 --> 00:08:52,620
Oh what's that? There was a cup?

167

171
00:09:00,620 --> 00:09:02,620
No?

172
00:09:02,620 --> 00:09:04,620
The CIA put a cup of

173
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:06,620
of mar- ee- agua

174
00:09:06,620 --> 00:09:08,620
in Bolivia?

175
00:09:08,620 --> 00:09:10,620
Is that what happened?

176
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:16,200
That's not what so this is what yeah, so we're supposed to believe that the that the CIA could carry a cup that far

177
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:22,340
Yeah, yeah, right you'd spill all the water. Yeah, I couldn't even carry. Hey, man

178
00:09:22,340 --> 00:09:28,020
JFK's brains all the way down a street. Yeah, they tried to put those in a cup

179
00:09:28,020 --> 00:09:30,180
That was in a cup as skull is a kind of cup

180
00:09:30,180 --> 00:09:38,160
Someone was doing because JFK was very promiscuous. They were actually just collecting DNA for a paternity test

181
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:40,160
Yeah, that was the...

182
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:42,160
That's why he blew his head open.

183
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:44,160
He used part of his brain to see...

184
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:49,160
They took a part of the brain from the kid and then a part of the brain from JFK.

185
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:51,160
That's the origin of QAnon.

186
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:53,160
Yeah.

187
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:56,160
And it turns out that child, Chester Bennington.

188
00:09:56,160 --> 00:10:02,160
Chester Bennington was leading clues in all of the...

189
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:04,160
Yeah.

190
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:06,160
I mean, just look at the names of the albums.

191
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:11,620
of the albums hybrid theory a hybrid of JFK and and the mother mm-hmm that's what

192
00:10:11,620 --> 00:10:15,920
Chester Bennington is Meteora a bullet hitting JFK's head is kind of like a

I don't like this when he's eating food.

236
00:13:56,940 --> 00:14:00,780
- I do sit there and I kind of like

237
00:14:00,780 --> 00:14:03,300
look at the menu for like 20 minutes.

238
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:05,980
- You do take a long time to order, that is true.

239
00:14:05,980 --> 00:14:06,820
- Why is that?

240
00:14:06,820 --> 00:14:08,180
Are you just such a thoughtful guy?

smiley face french fries. - The waiter comes

245
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,480
and you finished reading the second line of the menu.

246
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:17,880
- Yeah, I do read everything on the menu.

247
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:19,200
- You're a slow reader.

00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:20,440
- Yeah, I am too.

249
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:22,360
I'm a slow eater too.

250
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:24,320
- And you're a slow cheater.

251
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:25,480
- That's right. - No.

252
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:26,320
- Yeah, I've never cheated.

253
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:28,040
- And you're a slow speeder.

254
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:30,440
- You got a slow peener down there.

255
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:31,860

262
00:14:57,760 --> 00:15:03,120

263
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:07,200
been kind of off Twitter. Yeah I don't know who the guy is. All I know about him is that he showed

264
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:11,580

267
00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:28,560
developed that yeah yeah so I took my balls in my wiener and I basically

268
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:32,960
reversed them like what you do with like a mr. potato head to be funny and I got

269
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:36,480
my penis on the bottom and my balls on the top it was a really it was a really

270
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:40,800
like like striking image like kind of burned itself into it did look like

271
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:43,960
potatoes yeah it was like just like a little it was like you just had a lump

272
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:47,520
like a potato yeah it looked like something was seriously medically wrong

273
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:52,920
yeah but it's not I just like you had an egg sac down there yeah what if I had

274
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:58,720
given birth to a tiny me you could out of that you could give birth to a mini

275
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:03,120
you get a ball and hatch like eggs what would a mini me of Caleb be like

276
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:10,720
probably like Caleb but smaller yeah yeah it'd be the same size okay yeah all right

277
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:14,280
you can't get any smaller than me I'm already so little they should when they

278
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:20,000
need when they need like a child actor they should just cast Warwick Davis just

279
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:24,240
a separate thought just thinking okay just like if they need like you know like

280
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:28,100
if it's like a coming-of-age movie and they want a kid who can really sell the

281
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:32,160
lines and really doesn't have trouble reading or memorizing stuff should just

282
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:35,120
at Warwick Davis and they should still have him in the in the Harry Potter

313
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:12,840

I've been wanting to show you this for a while.

316
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:17,480
There's this thing,

317
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:20,840
it's the top ten everyday things that could be eliminated by 2030.

318
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:25,440
Oh really? Do you want to just have like a hanging out conversation about it? Yeah, we just hang out and talk about it, I thought.

319
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:27,320
Really? Wow.

320
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:30,360
I don't know if I want to do that. Me and Caleb actually wrote all of it.

321
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:34,120
We just came up with it. Oh really? Actually we didn't write it, we're just gonna come up with it on the spot

322
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:37,360
like you do at a hangout now that I think about it. Oh, okay. Yeah.

323
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:41,760
Yeah, you know, to me it feels like this list would be written by someone, if there was an actual list,

324
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:44,840
I bet someone named dark_shadow would have made it.

325
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:48,280
well that's caleb's username on most sites that's true

326
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:52,840
fear me and it is the and that he does have the same lakers profile picture

327
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:54,860
i like the lakers whatever

328
00:18:54,860 --> 00:18:57,280
let's look at the list of those profile a

329
00:18:57,280 --> 00:19:01,600

00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:27,760
Wow.

337
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:33,880
Wow. Okay, we have a cool kind of centrist writing this list. I like it.

338
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:35,280
I love a cool centrist.

339
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:39,560
So this is the top 10 everyday things that could be eliminated by 2030, which is only

340
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:40,560
what?

341
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:41,560
10 years.

342
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:42,560
10, 20 years.

343
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:49,960
years really hard to tell when number one TV okay I think cable TV could be

344
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:54,600
eliminated by 20 I think it's gonna be all it's gonna be all podcasts yeah it's

345
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:59,200
all it's gonna be it's gonna be we are gonna be Fox News yeah mm-hmm this is

346
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:04,560
gonna be sort of the Fox News of the podcasting world yeah we're gonna be

347
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:11,040
huge with older older my mom mm-hmm yeah older than your mom or older versions of

348
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:15,640
your mom. The 10 year older version of my mom. Okay. And then the 10 years old version of

349
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:21,140
Cameron's mom. She'll be 10 by then. Yeah, she ages at a very slow rate. She ages at about

350
00:20:21,140 --> 00:20:24,760
half the rate. She's born on a leap year. She's born on the 4th of July. That would be 4, that

351
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:28,720
would be 1/4. And she has no legs. That's when I was born on. So that's not possible. The

352
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:35,600
4th of July, you have no legs. I have legs. Prove it. Walk to me right now. Walk to New

353
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:41,000
York City in this moment. Those are prosthetics. I've been fooled by that hot girl online.

354
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:46,880
with fake legs those are prosthetic legs if I if I had prosthetic legs I think I

355
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:52,200
would run around you wouldn't you wouldn't even dare I know what would do

356
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:56,480
you because then your legs wouldn't go no you're kind of good the prosthetic

357
00:20:56,480 --> 00:21:00,920
legs I honestly thought about losing my legs if I got robot legs I feel like I

358
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:05,160
could walk to New York that is so true you know if I got on an airplane I feel

359
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:07,160
I feel like I could land anywhere in the world.

360
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:08,000
- Yeah.

361
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,400
(laughing)

362
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:10,840
But no, 'cause if the robot--

363
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:13,280
- If I got in a boat, if I got in a boat--

364
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:15,240
- No, no, like I don't lose my legs,

365
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:18,800
but I get like a pair of robot add-ons to my legs.

366
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:21,720
- Like a cybernetic implant.

367
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:24,320
- Yeah, if I got cybernetic implants in my leg,

368
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:26,160
I would walk anywhere.

369
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:27,000
- Interesting.

370
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,720
- You would walk anywhere.

371
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:29,560
- Can we fact check that?

372
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:30,400
- You could just fall asleep.

373
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:31,720
- Can we get a fact check on this one?

374
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:33,440
- Yeah, I could fall asleep while I was walking,

375
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:35,700
turn it on autopilot, walk to New York and like--

376
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:37,220
- You would fall in a hole.

377
00:21:37,220 --> 00:21:40,620
- How long do you think that walk would be?

378
00:21:40,620 --> 00:21:43,140
- I mean, it's like 100 and something miles.

379
00:21:43,140 --> 00:21:45,480
- No. - It'd probably take days.

380
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:47,980
- It would take 77 hours.

381
00:21:47,980 --> 00:21:50,180
- Yeah, that's not bad. - Days.

382
00:21:50,180 --> 00:21:51,100
- That's not days.

383
00:21:51,100 --> 00:21:52,460
What are you talking about, days?

384
00:21:52,460 --> 00:21:53,580
- That is days.

385
00:21:53,580 --> 00:21:54,780
That would take days.

386
00:21:54,780 --> 00:21:57,260
If you ran at a marathon pace,

387
00:21:57,260 --> 00:21:59,620
you could do it in a couple days.

388
00:21:59,620 --> 00:22:01,660
- That's like three days.

389
00:22:01,660 --> 00:22:03,360
- All right, but you're also not considering,

390
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:08,880
would have cybernetic legs we are considering that I'm no no cybernetic

391
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:14,440
cybernetic legs that go the speed of a car then that's just a car no it's legs

392
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:20,520
it's legs but it's what I'm saying as far as but so it would take three hours

393
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:25,720
then that's fine yeah okay well I have cybernetic legs that go from New York to

394
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:31,160
Boston in one second how long would that take I don't know it's the worst

395
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:35,240
conversation I've ever had with you no it absolutely definitely had worse

396
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:41,800
conversation we have not had a painful shut up

397
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:48,200
let's look at the comment I can teleport instantly with my legs from New York

398
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:52,360
I'm done with the legs thing there is no there these legs don't exist you're

399
00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:58,480
making up legs and then you're exactly there's a cyborg leg you're supposed to

400
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:02,580
you can't you have to imagine something before it exists or else you can't invent it.

401
00:23:02,580 --> 00:23:09,500
What if you have one fast robot leg and one of the slowest human leg of all time?

402
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:16,140
You take the average. What's the average? One minute. One minute per leg.

403
00:23:16,140 --> 00:23:25,860
Hour. Okay, one minute per leg. How long does it take to go from Boston to New York City?

404
00:23:25,860 --> 00:23:35,380
well two legs probably 77 77 legs well then you got to do one time 60 60

405
00:23:35,380 --> 00:23:39,320
minutes in the house I think I don't do that one for me Patrick real quick one

406
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:46,420
time 60 is one yeah that is 60 it's 160 because you're adding 160 yeah yeah

407
00:23:46,420 --> 00:23:52,540
hundred yeah so it'd be 160 minutes to get to New York that's that's you could

408
00:23:52,540 --> 00:23:57,220
watch a hundred episodes of 60 minutes in that time. Which you're also installed on

409
00:23:57,220 --> 00:24:02,580
your robot leg. Yeah you have it has a screen that pops up. Yeah as a screen on

410
00:24:02,580 --> 00:24:05,860
the inside I've thought about having for a while a screen on the inside of my

411
00:24:05,860 --> 00:24:13,060
thigh so that when I was like I was like jacking off I could use two hands.

412
00:24:13,060 --> 00:24:21,940
Pulling a pod. What the hell dude? Wait you don't you don't you don't have a mount that you

413
00:24:21,940 --> 00:24:29,700
use your phone? A mount? Yeah. In my bathroom? Yeah. Why would I have a mount?

414
00:24:29,700 --> 00:24:33,580
Why don't you don't put your phone on a tripod when you jack off is what I'm

415
00:24:33,580 --> 00:24:40,580
asking. Not it, no. There's not room. Okay you weird. I think you weird. You bring a

416
00:24:40,580 --> 00:24:45,380
tripod? Hey mom, dad, I'm just gonna. I'm about to go jack off I need my I need to

417
00:24:45,380 --> 00:24:50,100
borrow the Manfrotto. I need to borrow the tripod. The Manfrotto. I need to borrow the little

418
00:24:50,100 --> 00:24:52,100
man Frodo to jack me off.

419
00:24:52,100 --> 00:24:54,100
Nah dude, I fuckin...

420
00:24:54,100 --> 00:24:56,100
I just hold my...

421
00:24:56,100 --> 00:24:58,100
You hold your phone in your feet

422
00:24:58,100 --> 00:25:00,100
and then you use

423
00:25:00,100 --> 00:25:02,100
both hands behind your head to push

424
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:04,100
your head down onto your dick.

425
00:25:04,100 --> 00:25:06,100
I basically put my phone between my

426
00:25:06,100 --> 00:25:08,100
eyebrow and my nose like

427
00:25:08,100 --> 00:25:10,100
this. Like VR goggles. And I'm just gonna squeeze

428
00:25:10,100 --> 00:25:12,100
really hard. Yeah, I put it in my

429
00:25:12,100 --> 00:25:14,100
Google Cardboard. Yeah.

430
00:25:14,100 --> 00:25:16,100
And I just jack off that way.

431
00:25:16,100 --> 00:25:18,100
Yeah, and I get really scared.

432
00:25:18,100 --> 00:25:19,460
Yeah, and I play a horror game.

433
00:25:19,460 --> 00:25:23,060
Well, even then, even then you have to hold the Google cardboard up to your head.

434
00:25:23,060 --> 00:25:24,060
No?

435
00:25:24,060 --> 00:25:25,780
Not, not if you have two rubber bands.

436
00:25:25,780 --> 00:25:28,060
Oh, I didn't think about that.

437
00:25:28,060 --> 00:25:29,060
Mm-hmm.

438
00:25:29,060 --> 00:25:30,060
That's right.

439
00:25:30,060 --> 00:25:31,060
Yeah.

440
00:25:31,060 --> 00:25:32,060
Fucking no.

441
00:25:32,060 --> 00:25:33,060
And so how long would that take you?

442
00:25:33,060 --> 00:25:34,060
That takes me about an hour and a half.

443
00:25:34,060 --> 00:25:35,060
Okay.

444
00:25:35,060 --> 00:25:37,180
But what if it was robotic?

445
00:25:37,180 --> 00:25:40,540
If it was robotic, I would be two minutes per leg.

446
00:25:40,540 --> 00:25:41,540
Okay.

447
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:42,540
Yeah.

448
00:25:42,540 --> 00:25:45,220
So slower than going to New York.

449
00:25:45,220 --> 00:25:46,220
Way slower.

450
00:25:46,220 --> 00:25:47,220
So jacking off takes less time.

451
00:25:47,220 --> 00:25:48,760
- It's either slower or faster.

452
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:49,600
- Way faster.

453
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:50,420
(laughing)

454
00:25:50,420 --> 00:25:51,260
That's right.

455
00:25:51,260 --> 00:25:52,940
(laughing)

456
00:25:52,940 --> 00:25:53,780
- You don't even know what it is.

457
00:25:53,780 --> 00:25:55,580
- But it's not the same.

458
00:25:55,580 --> 00:25:56,700
- No, it's not the same.

459
00:25:56,700 --> 00:25:57,740
That's all we know.

460
00:25:57,740 --> 00:26:00,020
- So that's the deal with cable TV.

461
00:26:00,020 --> 00:26:01,300
- Yeah, so that's what's up.

462
00:26:01,300 --> 00:26:03,100
That's what's gonna happen at cable TV in 2030.

463
00:26:03,100 --> 00:26:07,180
- The number two thing is that we's gone,

464
00:26:07,180 --> 00:26:11,260
eliminated, I'm sorry, eliminated by 2030.

465
00:26:11,260 --> 00:26:13,220
Newspapers.

466
00:26:13,220 --> 00:26:14,060
Sorry, buddy.

467
00:26:14,060 --> 00:26:16,140
- No, we need newspapers 'cause what else

468
00:26:16,140 --> 00:26:20,940
you gonna put fish and chips on in England? Where the fuck am I gonna read the funnies

469
00:26:20,940 --> 00:26:24,900

470
00:26:24,900 --> 00:26:30,380
England because they're like 20 years behind anyway. That's true. All of them still live

471
00:26:30,380 --> 00:26:37,380
in castles with ghouls. They do live in huts. Where am I gonna read Non-Sequitur? And Hagar

Yeah.

503
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:28,720

you have to see this mustard comic."

511
00:28:56,200 --> 00:29:01,020
It'll be like a single panel comic of like two pieces of poop walking around and one

512
00:29:01,020 --> 00:29:05,780
of them says wow you're a real piece of human and then the caption says poop

One free round of 56, 5.6 millimeter ammo.

564
00:32:20,220 --> 00:32:26,980
I use a coupon like a perfume sample and I just kind of scratch it and rub it all over

565
00:32:26,980 --> 00:32:27,980
my body.

566
00:32:27,980 --> 00:32:30,460

Yeah, I've been using a lot of coupons as of late.

569
00:32:35,820 --> 00:32:41,660
Oh I don't know why this reminded me, but something that was making me chuckle at work

570
00:32:41,660 --> 00:32:45,220
was like we have like like candy at the front like they're like

it's not going to happen

577
00:32:59,820 --> 00:33:02,260
it's the uh... the funniest thing

578
00:33:02,260 --> 00:33:05,460
like a guy who like looks homeless walking up and buying like two handles

579
00:33:05,460 --> 00:33:07,560

583
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:15,800
yeah let me get it

584
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:19,640
it's like the funniest, I can't imagine the thought process

585
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:22,760
yeah I need some candy too

586
00:33:22,760 --> 00:33:26,440
you know I shouldn't be having all this alcohol on an empty stomach let me get a

587
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:27,480
Nutter Butter

588
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:32,760
here's like a fifty five hundred milliliter bottle of a jack apple

589
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:35,680
oh fuck I haven't had a zero bar in years

590
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:38,000
I don't remember what his Eurobar is. Is that white chocolate?

591
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,000
Yeah, I'll take his Eurobar.

592
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:44,400
Yeah, the guy who grabbed a Slim Jim was like, "I haven't had one of these in ten years."

593
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:46,400
Don't believe it.

594
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:48,400
First of all, I don't believe you.

595
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:50,400
I don't believe you, yeah.

596
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:52,400
I don't believe you know the date you last had a Slim Jim.

597
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:54,400
And second of all, I don't think you should have it.

598
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:56,400
Right.

599
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:58,400
We can deny service to anybody at any time.

600
00:33:58,400 --> 00:34:00,400
We are a private establishment.

601
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:02,400
And sir, you are not getting Slim Jims.

602
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:04,400
I got a guy who comes in reeking of Slim Jims.

603
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:05,400
Slim Jims.

604
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:06,400
Five minutes before we close in.

605
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:10,840
You know, I haven't had one of these in ten years.

606
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:13,360
He's got Slim Jims poking out of his cargo pants.

607
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:18,200
I'll take 50.

608
00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:23,800
Some Jims are good because you can ring them out for the grease like a towel.

609
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:24,800
Oh yeah.

610
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:27,000
And you can cook with it.

611
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:30,880
You can roll it up over your gas can.

612
00:34:30,880 --> 00:34:34,080
I never ate a Slim Jim until this year.

613
00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:36,680
I've never not believed something you've said more than that.

614
00:34:36,680 --> 00:34:39,480
No, I really I didn't.

615
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:45,240
I feel like this is a trick and you're saying like I've never eaten one Slim Jim until this

616
00:34:45,240 --> 00:34:46,240
year.

617
00:34:46,240 --> 00:34:52,440
I believe that Patrick has never eaten a Slim Jim but he ate as a child every day he ate

618
00:34:52,440 --> 00:34:55,080
some Chinese snack called like Let's Meat.

619
00:34:55,080 --> 00:34:56,080
Yeah.

620
00:34:56,080 --> 00:35:02,120
It was like exactly a Slim Jim but with pigeon mixed into it.

621
00:35:02,120 --> 00:35:03,120
It's like made up.

622
00:35:03,120 --> 00:35:09,860
Squab I had a squab meat stick. What's wrong with that? Yeah, they just like scrape off the suicide nets at a Foxconn factory

623
00:35:09,860 --> 00:35:10,860
Oh my god

624
00:35:10,860 --> 00:35:15,860
And that's all the animals and the and shit that get caught in it and the leaves and the guys

625
00:35:15,860 --> 00:35:20,860
And then they just put it through like the the lo mein mold where they make all the noodles

626
00:35:20,860 --> 00:35:22,860
And it legally has to be sold as incense

627
00:35:27,860 --> 00:35:29,860
Yeah, it's like bath salts.

628
00:35:29,860 --> 00:35:32,260
I did eat in high school.

629
00:35:32,260 --> 00:35:33,260
I went to Chinatown once.

630
00:35:33,260 --> 00:35:34,260
It's called Essence of Man.

631
00:35:34,260 --> 00:35:39,420
I ate a lot of shrimp crackers one day.

632
00:35:39,420 --> 00:35:44,820
See, that's the basis I was going off of when I said that about you eating a strange Chinese

633
00:35:44,820 --> 00:35:48,580
star food for a high schooler to like.

634
00:35:48,580 --> 00:35:49,580
They're good.

635
00:35:49,580 --> 00:35:53,140
They smell like penis though.

636
00:35:53,140 --> 00:35:55,940
They smell like unwashed penis.

637
00:35:55,940 --> 00:35:57,780
You know what that smells like?

638
00:35:57,780 --> 00:35:58,280
Why?

639
00:35:58,280 --> 00:36:00,020
And you know what the weasel what the why?

640
00:36:00,020 --> 00:36:00,520
The why?

641
00:36:00,520 --> 00:36:01,020
Okay.

642
00:36:01,020 --> 00:36:03,620
I don't wash my penis for religious reasons.

643
00:36:03,620 --> 00:36:04,120
Yeah.

644
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:05,660
You don't wash it, dude.

645
00:36:05,660 --> 00:36:07,180
It's like sourdough.

646
00:36:07,180 --> 00:36:09,020
Yeah, it's like a cast iron skillet.

647
00:36:09,020 --> 00:36:10,220
You're not supposed to wash it.

648
00:36:10,220 --> 00:36:13,180
Men be treating their beds like a cast iron skillet.

649
00:36:13,180 --> 00:36:15,180
Has anybody done that yet?

650
00:36:15,180 --> 00:36:17,680
Oh my God.

651
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:19,580
Yeah, that's right.

652
00:36:19,580 --> 00:36:23,080
I actually do have to wash my cast iron skillet this week

653
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:25,280
because the mice have been living in it.

654
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:27,960
Oh yeah, you talked about that before.

655
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:28,960
You gotta put soap in it.

656
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:29,960
Fucked up.

657
00:36:29,960 --> 00:36:33,400
Uh, yeah, there was mice in it.

658
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:35,440
There's the only way, only way you can clean a casserole.

659
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:38,400
No, you don't understand, I said, "Baby, I still can't, like, we can't wash it."

660
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:39,400
No, it's seasoning.

661
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:40,400
I know there's rat shit in it.

662
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:41,400
It's seasoning.

663
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:42,400
It's seasoning.

664
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:43,400
Anything that goes in is legally seasoning.

665
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:44,400
Legally.

666
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:45,400
Yeah.

667
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:46,400
Yeah.

668
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:47,400
And that's southern law.

669
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:49,600
And that's southern poverty law, sir.

670
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:51,600
I was gonna say that.

671
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:53,520
I was gonna say that, but I don't know if you do.

672
00:36:53,520 --> 00:37:00,200
Number four TV remotes that's right yeah that guy's but from the greatest freak

673
00:37:00,200 --> 00:37:06,400
out ever wait here's a really good comment this is it has a picture of as a

674
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:10,760
picture of the the I list item as a picture of a TV remote and then the

675
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:14,640
comment says hey that looks like my TV remote and then a smiley face and then

676
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:20,240
Josh tition 24 but there's a space there's a space there's a space after

677
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:31,200
Josh Tishen and before 24 so it looks like is his age. Josh Tishen 24. This is good, this

678
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:34,640
will be a good one because then you won't lose your remote in the couch but what if

679
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:38,960
you're using what if it's like you lose your brain in the couch now because you

680
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:42,200
use it to control the TV. That can already happen you can use your screams

681
00:37:42,200 --> 00:37:47,000
to control the TV. I lost my brain in the couch. This is a TV that runs

682
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:54,360
completely on screen. This is a TV that is completely fear powered. Yeah. Yeah, it'll

683
00:37:54,360 --> 00:37:59,400
go to whatever channel you're most afraid of. If you want, yeah. It sucks because it

684
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:03,040
keeps opening up shutters. Dad, why does the channel keep changing to BET when you sit

685
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:19,680
it down. I got the respect power TV. I don't really want to watch Dateline. I can't change

686
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:29,460
a channel. No, I really can't. Life would be different without TV remotes. Like if you

687
00:38:29,460 --> 00:38:34,220
You had to use your phone to change the channel or volume from trains 45, which you can already

688
00:38:34,220 --> 00:38:35,980
if you have a Roku you can already do that.

689
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:40,020
Yeah, if you had a Roku you could already do that trains 45 get with the program.

690
00:38:40,020 --> 00:38:42,020
Yeah, trains you stupid motherfucker.

691
00:38:42,020 --> 00:38:43,460
Yeah, I do.

692
00:38:43,460 --> 00:38:45,540
Yeah, Patrick loves Roku.

693
00:38:45,540 --> 00:38:46,540
What's up with you and Roku lately?

694
00:38:46,540 --> 00:38:47,540
It changed my life.

695
00:38:47,540 --> 00:38:48,820
What changed your life about Roku?

696
00:38:48,820 --> 00:38:50,420
I'm gonna report this in my life forever.

697
00:38:50,420 --> 00:38:52,220
Is it the Pandora integration?

698
00:38:52,220 --> 00:38:53,220
Yeah.

699
00:38:53,220 --> 00:38:54,220
Yeah?

700
00:38:54,220 --> 00:38:57,060
Is it you can listen to Tenacious D radio?

701
00:38:57,060 --> 00:38:58,860
I'm reporting the picture of it.

702
00:38:58,860 --> 00:39:02,940
I'm clicking report image on the picture of the TV remote and I'm reporting it saying

703
00:39:02,940 --> 00:39:05,860
it is copyright protected.

704
00:39:05,860 --> 00:39:11,300
Let's see if we can get that taken down.

705
00:39:11,300 --> 00:39:15,100
It looks too much like Josh Tishen's TV remote.

706
00:39:15,100 --> 00:39:17,900
It's copy written by Josh Tishen.

707
00:39:17,900 --> 00:39:20,500
Oh no, it says you have to file a DMCA.

708
00:39:20,500 --> 00:39:21,500
Alright, let's do it.

709
00:39:21,500 --> 00:39:23,780
Alright, let's file one dude.

710
00:39:23,780 --> 00:39:28,380
Please follow the instructions on our copyright policy page for submitting a takedown notice.

711
00:39:28,380 --> 00:39:32,300
The DMCA is like one of the worst fucking things of all time.

712
00:39:32,300 --> 00:39:33,300
Of all time?

713
00:39:33,300 --> 00:39:34,300
Of all time.

714
00:39:34,300 --> 00:39:35,300
Yeah.

715
00:39:35,300 --> 00:39:37,060
What is the DMCA to you?

716
00:39:37,060 --> 00:39:40,140
The DMCA ruined YouTube poop in 2010.

717
00:39:40,140 --> 00:39:41,140
That is true.

718
00:39:41,140 --> 00:39:42,140
It really did.

719
00:39:42,140 --> 00:39:43,140
Yeah.

720
00:39:43,140 --> 00:39:44,260
It took down one of the greatest art forms.

721
00:39:44,260 --> 00:39:46,900
It took down Crobo Productions I think at one point.

722
00:39:46,900 --> 00:39:48,660
It took down Vaser Vase.

723
00:39:48,660 --> 00:39:50,540
It took down Vaser Vase.

724
00:39:50,540 --> 00:39:52,660
Yeah, Vaser Vase could never recover.

725
00:39:52,660 --> 00:39:54,180
He never got his fan base back.

726
00:39:54,180 --> 00:39:55,260
- Where'd it go?

727
00:39:55,260 --> 00:39:56,100
- I don't know.

728
00:39:56,100 --> 00:39:56,920
- I don't see.

729
00:39:56,920 --> 00:39:57,760
- Acer.

730
00:39:57,760 --> 00:39:58,600
- I don't see.

731
00:39:58,600 --> 00:39:59,420
- All those guys, they're gone.

732
00:39:59,420 --> 00:40:00,260
- Yeah, yeah.

733
00:40:00,260 --> 00:40:01,100
- Mm-hmm.

734
00:40:01,100 --> 00:40:01,920
- Yeah.

735
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:02,760
- Yeah, and then people would file

736
00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:04,340
false DMCA reports against each other

737
00:40:04,340 --> 00:40:05,900
and then get their channels taken down.

738
00:40:05,900 --> 00:40:06,980
- That is pretty funny.

739
00:40:06,980 --> 00:40:07,860
That's a funny move.

740
00:40:07,860 --> 00:40:10,300
If someone wants to DMCA our podcast,

741
00:40:10,300 --> 00:40:11,140
that'd be kind of funny.

742
00:40:11,140 --> 00:40:11,960
- Don't, no, no, no, no, no, no.

743
00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:12,800
- Don't do that.

744
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:13,640
- That'd be a little funny.

745
00:40:13,640 --> 00:40:14,460
- No, no, no, no.

746
00:40:14,460 --> 00:40:15,300
- Don't do that.

747
00:40:15,300 --> 00:40:17,260
- I've already gotten reported for impersonating myself.

748
00:40:17,260 --> 00:40:18,100
They'll do it.

749
00:40:18,100 --> 00:40:19,980
- No.

750
00:40:19,980 --> 00:40:28,040
that was channel fans that did that that was because I told you under a Felix

751
00:40:28,040 --> 00:40:31,820
treat matters one it said hey chopper fans can we all report this guy thank

752
00:40:31,820 --> 00:40:40,900
you and it worked so fucking funny sheep change his name on Twitter because he

753
00:40:40,900 --> 00:40:48,320
was impersonating someone Patrick yeah sick number six which is funny because

754
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:52,320
my profile picture is an impersonator. That is true.

755
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:56,320
Number 5 is movie theaters. Yeah, I could do without them.

756
00:40:56,320 --> 00:41:00,320
I don't like them man. We've talked about this so much.

757
00:41:00,320 --> 00:41:04,320
We've talked about this and this is one of our things.

758
00:41:04,320 --> 00:41:08,320
Nah, I don't need them. Get rid of them. Fuck them.

759
00:41:08,320 --> 00:41:12,320
Here's a comment. Reading, listening to music, going to the cinema is always a pleasure

760
00:41:12,320 --> 00:41:16,320
and it is necessary to establish physical contact to get real pleasure, not just

761
00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:23,760
just in the virtual. Physical pleasure at the movies? Excuse me sir, I'm going to the

762
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:31,840
movie theater for physical pleasure. Yeah, which row in the theater

763
00:41:31,840 --> 00:41:35,200
would be the best for physical pleasure? Yeah, I just I'm trying to get as much

764
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:40,920
physical pleasure while I'm here as possible. Yeah, this is Surf's Up, right?

765
00:41:40,920 --> 00:41:44,000
I'm in the right movie theater. Can I run around the theater for physical

766
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:44,840
Pleasure.

767
00:41:44,840 --> 00:41:45,660
Yeah.

768
00:41:45,660 --> 00:41:48,540
Can I crawl into the popcorn machine?

769
00:41:48,540 --> 00:41:50,080
Can I, let me get in there physically.

770
00:41:50,080 --> 00:41:50,920
Let me get in there.

771
00:41:50,920 --> 00:41:53,280
I bet it's warm and I bet it's bubbly.

772
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:54,480
Did you guys know kids in middle school

773
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:58,000
would just go to the movie theater and just get blown?

774
00:41:58,000 --> 00:41:58,840
Yeah.

775
00:41:58,840 --> 00:41:59,680
No.

776
00:41:59,680 --> 00:42:00,500
What is that about?

777
00:42:00,500 --> 00:42:01,340
Why are the movies theater?

778
00:42:01,340 --> 00:42:03,800
Because it's dark and there's no parents.

779
00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:08,800
But aren't they on high alert for that shit?

780
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:11,200
Isn't that like the number one thing

781
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:12,040
they're trying to stop?

782
00:42:12,040 --> 00:42:15,400
If you walk up to a 14 year old kid getting blown, you're the pedophile.

783
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:16,400
That's true.

784
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:17,400
Think about that.

785
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:18,400
That's true.

786
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:19,400
It's a trap.

787
00:42:19,400 --> 00:42:21,200
So why not do it in a park and just clear the whole park out?

788
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:22,200
Yeah.

789
00:42:22,200 --> 00:42:23,200
Right?

790
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:24,200
That's the problem.

791
00:42:24,200 --> 00:42:25,200
Because a bird could land on you.

792
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:26,200
Right.

793
00:42:26,200 --> 00:42:27,200
True.

794
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:28,200
A bird can't be...

795
00:42:28,200 --> 00:42:29,600
A hawk could see your wiener and think it's a worm and go at you.

796
00:42:29,600 --> 00:42:33,520
And actually hawks are younger than you, so then you're the pedophile.

797
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:34,520
Yeah, exactly.

798
00:42:34,520 --> 00:42:38,160
Because a hawk is only maybe two or three years old.

799
00:42:38,160 --> 00:42:42,660
there's a kid that went to my high school who got who saw the Smurfs in its last week and

800
00:42:42,660 --> 00:42:45,580
got a got a tug and everyone called him Papa Smurf.

801
00:42:45,580 --> 00:42:46,580
From a Smurf.

802
00:42:46,580 --> 00:42:47,580
They called him Papa Smurf.

803
00:42:47,580 --> 00:42:48,580
Yeah.

804
00:42:48,580 --> 00:42:49,580
Damn.

805
00:42:49,580 --> 00:42:50,580
Yeah, everyone just called him Papa Smurf.

806
00:42:50,580 --> 00:42:54,140
Who was his beautiful Smurfette?

807
00:42:54,140 --> 00:42:55,140
I don't remember.

808
00:42:55,140 --> 00:42:56,140
I'm not gonna say the kid's name.

809
00:42:56,140 --> 00:42:57,140
It was Patrick.

810
00:42:57,140 --> 00:42:58,140
It was Patrick.

811
00:42:58,140 --> 00:42:59,140
Patrick was the Smurfette.

812
00:42:59,140 --> 00:43:00,140
Yeah.

813
00:43:00,140 --> 00:43:04,260
No, if you think I would be the person to ever do that.

814
00:43:04,260 --> 00:43:06,900
You'd be Smurfete.

815
00:43:06,900 --> 00:43:11,240
think I'd be cool enough in high school to get my shit tugged at the Smurfs no you

816
00:43:11,240 --> 00:43:15,860
were talking the shit you were the tugger no yeah you were saying I mean I

817
00:43:15,860 --> 00:43:20,780
was tugging but I was in the bathroom and the Smurfs was on at the movie theater

818
00:43:20,780 --> 00:43:25,620
yeah yeah that's cool just listening to the very muffled faraway sound yeah I

819
00:43:25,620 --> 00:43:30,700
have I have a gargoyle voice and busting all over the stall wall I was listening

820
00:43:30,700 --> 00:43:36,420
to the George Lopez Smurf and I shot my shit over the wall of the stall

821
00:43:36,420 --> 00:43:42,420
into the next stall like a perfect arc like a world of tanks game

822
00:43:42,420 --> 00:43:49,420
head of the theater manager sitting in the next stall

823
00:43:49,420 --> 00:43:52,180
number six passwords

824
00:43:52,180 --> 00:43:56,220
what how does this work?

825
00:43:56,220 --> 00:43:58,260
how is this one going to work?

826
00:43:58,260 --> 00:44:02,140
oh because you're going to use your brain

827
00:44:02,140 --> 00:44:06,120
everything's just going to turn into your just using your brain that's true yeah

828
00:44:06,120 --> 00:44:08,800
yeah we're not gonna need food anymore will just think

829
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:12,760
moses and think and be sandy nurt nate nationalist nationalist shirt and

830
00:44:12,760 --> 00:44:17,160
nurtured nurtured by our school being nourished by thought by a thoughts of a

831

that says "No way am I letting a robot cook my food."

875
00:46:57,440 --> 00:46:59,380
Then again, I don't eat fast food a lot.

876
00:46:59,380 --> 00:47:03,220
I actually like actual restaurants a lot more.

877
00:47:03,220 --> 00:47:07,840
- So what's a fast food, what's McDonald's gonna be like?

878
00:47:07,840 --> 00:47:10,840
- McDonald's is a gourmet restaurant.

879
00:47:10,840 --> 00:47:13,960
They got the J Balvin video.

880
00:47:13,960 --> 00:47:15,680
- That's how you eliminate fast food jobs

881
00:47:15,680 --> 00:47:18,400
is you change it from being fast food.

882
00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:19,240
- True.

883
00:47:19,240 --> 00:47:20,560
- And then they're just normal food jobs.

884
00:47:20,560 --> 00:47:22,060
- You're right, gourmet.

885
00:47:22,060 --> 00:47:24,540
- You put the word gourmet next to McDonald's.

886
00:47:24,540 --> 00:47:26,060
- Gourmet McDonald's. - That's true, yeah.

887
00:47:26,060 --> 00:47:27,060
And then that's it.

888
00:47:27,060 --> 00:47:29,700
- Have you seen the J Balvin meal?

889
00:47:29,700 --> 00:47:31,340
Have you seen the J Balvin meal?

890
00:47:31,340 --> 00:47:35,580
Why did they, he didn't even do anything special.

891
00:47:35,580 --> 00:47:38,060
- J Balvin meal.

892
00:47:38,060 --> 00:47:41,580
- It's just fries with ketchup,

893
00:47:41,580 --> 00:47:44,300
a Big Mac, no pickles, and an Oreo McFlurry.

894
00:47:44,300 --> 00:47:45,700
- Who is J Balvin?

895
00:47:45,700 --> 00:47:49,580
- He's like a, he's the Prince of Reggaeton.

896
00:47:49,580 --> 00:47:50,900

906
00:48:40,580 --> 00:48:46,500
it's like the times for you up late doom scrolling on McDonald's timeline

907
00:48:46,500 --> 00:48:51,700
Every day he wakes up and he prints out like a tri-fold version of the McDonald's Twitter

908
00:48:51,700 --> 00:48:53,420
and just reads it like a horoscope.

909
00:48:53,420 --> 00:48:54,420
Can you believe this?

910
00:48:54,420 --> 00:48:55,420
Jesus Christ.

911
00:48:55,420 --> 00:48:56,420
Can you believe this?

912
00:48:56,420 --> 00:48:57,420
God damn it.

913
00:48:57,420 --> 00:49:02,660
Yeah, and the funny pages is all the, is just all of the McDonald's tweets from other languages.

914
00:49:02,660 --> 00:49:07,260
Yeah, he's reading McDonald's Malaysia just chuckling to himself.

915
00:49:07,260 --> 00:49:09,220
Hey son, come here, look at this.

916
00:49:09,220 --> 00:49:10,740
It's a pretty good one.

917
00:49:10,740 --> 00:49:12,540
I'm gonna clip this one and put it on the fridge.

918
00:49:12,540 --> 00:49:15,540
Yeah, look, it's called L Big Mac.

919
00:49:15,540 --> 00:49:17,540
(laughing)

920
00:49:17,540 --> 00:49:19,040
Number eight, taxis.

921
00:49:19,040 --> 00:49:23,420
Yeah, taxis are already kinda gone, I feel like.

922
00:49:23,420 --> 00:49:25,340
- Yeah, it's all Ubers now.

923
00:49:25,340 --> 00:49:28,140
- It's all, yeah, keep going, it's all Ubers now.

924
00:49:28,140 --> 00:49:29,980
- Yeah, it's all Ubers and Lyfts.

925
00:49:29,980 --> 00:49:31,140
- Yeah, and-- - Yeah, yeah.

926
00:49:31,140 --> 00:49:32,380
- And the train. - I'm gonna put my tube

927
00:49:32,380 --> 00:49:33,220
in your shit.

928
00:49:33,220 --> 00:49:35,460
(laughing)

929
00:49:35,460 --> 00:49:37,700
- That's right.

930
00:49:37,700 --> 00:49:39,420
I don't know, I feel like--

931
00:49:39,420 --> 00:49:42,040
- Kids nowadays will ride everywhere in an Uber,

932
00:49:42,040 --> 00:49:44,940
but when they're having sex, they won't put on a Ruber.

933
00:49:44,940 --> 00:49:48,380
Oh god damn Cameron.

934
00:49:48,380 --> 00:49:49,380
Yeah.

935
00:49:49,380 --> 00:49:53,820
McDonald's pinned tweet is "Grimace lives rent free in my head."

936
00:49:53,820 --> 00:49:54,820
That's awesome.

937
00:49:54,820 --> 00:49:55,820
That's so great.

938
00:49:55,820 --> 00:49:59,900
Grimace lives rent free in my head.

939
00:49:59,900 --> 00:50:08,500
Kids these days will all use their Lyft but at their taxi job they won't show up for a

940
00:50:08,500 --> 00:50:09,500
shift.

941
00:50:09,500 --> 00:50:10,500
Yeah.

942
00:50:10,500 --> 00:50:11,500
Oh my god.

943
00:50:11,500 --> 00:50:13,140
Because the kids are the taxi drivers now.

944
00:50:13,140 --> 00:50:14,140
Yeah that's true.

945
00:50:14,140 --> 00:50:17,260
That's how you save the taxi industry.

946
00:50:17,260 --> 00:50:19,620
You make a kid every taxi driver.

947
00:50:19,620 --> 00:50:20,820
Exactly.

948
00:50:20,820 --> 00:50:23,980
If kids were in charge of the taxis in the world...

949
00:50:23,980 --> 00:50:24,980
If kids were in charge...

950
00:50:24,980 --> 00:50:25,980
The Bruce Springsteen song.

951
00:50:25,980 --> 00:50:33,940
If kids were in charge of the taxis, they could change the world.

952
00:50:33,940 --> 00:50:36,260
Taxis will change the world.

953
00:50:36,260 --> 00:50:40,960
I think that a good move was when they started putting TVs in the back of the taxis and play

954
00:50:40,960 --> 00:50:43,700
like HGN.

955
00:50:43,700 --> 00:50:48,560
that was a really good move because now I just want gas now you know what you know

956
00:50:48,560 --> 00:50:54,140

1043
00:58:47,640 --> 00:58:53,240
albums on Spotify they're actually taking all the albums off this week

1044

1048
00:59:06,360 --> 00:59:07,360
Joe Dogan.

1049
00:59:07,360 --> 00:59:08,360
We're making a move.

1050
00:59:08,360 --> 00:59:09,360
We're moving to whatever the newest version of.

1051
00:59:09,360 --> 00:59:14,880
We're gonna have Spotify buy us out.

1052
00:59:14,880 --> 00:59:18,280
How much, if we came to them and we were like you guys can buy us out, how much do you think

1053
00:59:18,280 --> 00:59:19,280
they would offer us?

1054
00:59:19,280 --> 00:59:20,280
Like $500?

1055
00:59:20,280 --> 00:59:21,280
Yeah.

1056
00:59:21,280 --> 00:59:22,680
- I feel like if we could make,

1057
00:59:22,680 --> 00:59:25,860
if we need 500 bucks super fast, we could do that.

1058
00:59:25,860 --> 00:59:26,700
- Yeah. - Yeah.

1059
00:59:26,700 --> 00:59:28,460
- Yeah, it might be a good move, dude.

1060
00:59:28,460 --> 00:59:31,120
- Wouldn't be bad, I'm sure.

1061
00:59:31,120 --> 00:59:31,960
I'm sure we'd make a lot more.

1062
00:59:31,960 --> 00:59:35,280
- Think about what we could do with $500.

1063
00:59:35,280 --> 00:59:39,440
- Like weird, decentralized, Patreon-esque startups

1064
00:59:39,440 --> 00:59:41,960
keep messaging us and being like,

1065
00:59:41,960 --> 00:59:44,140
"Do you guys wanna be one of our flagship things?"

1066
00:59:44,140 --> 00:59:44,980
And it's like, "No."

1067
00:59:44,980 --> 00:59:49,380
- We are a crowdfunding program a lot like Patreon,

1068
00:59:49,380 --> 00:59:55,060
we're but we're not chain focused and racist yeah if you'd like to join what

1069
00:59:55,060 --> 00:59:58,820
was that it was like we got an email once that was like I love to smoke a

1070
00:59:58,820 --> 01:00:02,940
bowl and listen to your podcast yeah and then that and then that website that

1071
01:00:02,940 --> 01:00:06,960
email was from was fake like it's yeah it said that Joe Rogan was like featured

1072
01:00:06,960 --> 01:00:13,260
on it but it's not it's just like a scam that's enticing podcasters into a scam

1073
01:00:13,260 --> 01:00:19,020
by saying you love to smoke a bowl while you listen to the episodes. I love to smoke in a bowl. Fuck yeah dude.

1074
01:00:19,020 --> 01:00:25,180
Yeah we should maybe just start our own patreon thing. We should start a patreon for the podcast.

1075
01:00:25,180 --> 01:00:30,060
That's a great idea. We should just have people Venmo us and we send them the episode for that

1076
01:00:30,060 --> 01:00:35,660
week. Yeah and Patrick and Deering used to do all of the work. Yeah it's all manual. Finally Pat's gonna start pulling his weight.

1097
01:01:12,260 --> 01:01:14,400
You rolled away from the microphone because you were embarrassed.

1098
01:01:14,400 --> 01:01:17,700
No, because I had it hanging up and I was looking at it.

1099
