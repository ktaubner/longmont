19
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:42,080
Chief Kufra, if you're...

20
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:44,800
We would love for you to write a song for us.

21
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:46,600
We want you to write our new theme song.

22
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:48,080
We want to get plugged in.

23
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:49,080
Yeah.

24
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:51,160
I need to get plugged in with you.

25
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:53,640
He's on some next level shit that I never even considered.

26
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:57,640
I think that's the new $20,000 goal for the Patreon.

27
00:00:57,640 --> 00:00:59,640
I think we just do that in general.

28
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:01,640
Give Chief Kufra $20,000.

29
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:03,640
That's the goal.

30
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:05,640
Chief Kufra $20,000 to write us the new theme song.

31
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:07,640
I don't even care if he does that.

32
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:11,640
I mean he's got like he has some of the greatest songs of all time.

33
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:13,640
I think.

34
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:15,640
It's Time to See You Nude is a classic by now.

35
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:17,640
Yeah.

36
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:19,640

37
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:21,640
Oh, this is Time to See You Nude?

38
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:23,640
They all have the same beginning.

39
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:30,640
It's time to see you kiss It's time to see you kiss, oh, forever

00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:24,080

48
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:44,400
in a room. We need to see those two. We need to get those two on the ranch.

49
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:47,000
So the song, it's about...

50
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
So wait, it's about...

51
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000

52
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
You're saying, "Fo-Fo-Evo?"

53
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
What's a pussy carl type...

54
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
I could never be with one woman fo-evo.

55
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
What's a pussy carl?

56
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000

61
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:22,280
Chief Cooper, I gotta tell you, like, I played that song for my wife and it worked. I saw

62
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:29,120
her nude. It took her out of the coma. Yeah, it took her out. And then we had to bring

63
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:33,240
her back to life, but then she came back. Dude, I need to catch an invite from Doug.

64
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:35,240

65
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:37,240

66
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:38,240

70
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:43,640
Beer Hall Putsch.

72
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:47,240
Killing his mom.

73
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:48,240
Killing his mom, yeah.

74
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:49,240

00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:50,240
Yeah, killing his mom.

76
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:51,240

Oh yeah, dude.

81
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:58,240

82
00:03:58,240 --> 00:03:59,600
Really?

83
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:01,200
That one hit me right in my feels.

84
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:03,480
I'd kill my mom for a dollar.

85
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:04,480
Really?

86
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:05,480
One dollar.

87
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:06,480
Really?

88
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:09,640
Dude, if I had to kill my mom and like...

89
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:10,640
Kill my mom for nothing.

90
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:11,640
I would not kill my mom.

91
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:12,640
Are you kidding me?

92
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:13,640
I would never kill my parents.

93
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:19,560
I would come up behind my mom and I'd like do the Halo melee on the back of her neck

94
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:21,160
and I'd kill her in one second.

95
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:24,600
I would do Team Fortress 2 disguise kit and then become my mom.

96
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:28,560
I would literally...

97
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:29,560
Become my mom for a little bit.

98
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:30,560

120
00:06:14,380 --> 00:06:18,100
but I just realized like, oh yeah, no, he just doesn't like talking to me. Yeah. Yeah.

00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:40,860
I've never seen my dad out of his shell really. Oh, that's interesting.

126
00:06:44,420 --> 00:06:48,260
He's doing the fucking, the Beetlejuice song.

127
00:06:48,260 --> 00:06:51,060
Jake, Jake, Jake, you don't know.

128

129
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:54,660
(laughing)

130
00:06:54,660 --> 00:06:56,420
Yeah, that would surprise me.

131
00:06:56,420 --> 00:06:58,140
But I guess, I mean, that's kind of how my dad,

132
00:06:58,140 --> 00:07:00,060
whenever my dad gets around like his family,

133
00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:01,500
all this, like my dad's not,

134
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:03,980
like I would never say that my dad is like funny.

135
00:07:03,980 --> 00:07:06,220
But then when he gets around his family,

136
00:07:06,220 --> 00:07:07,940
he like, everybody's like, oh yeah,

137
00:07:07,940 --> 00:07:09,300
he's like the funny uncle.

138
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:10,140
Yeah.

139
00:07:10,140 --> 00:07:10,960
And he's just sitting there.

140
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:13,540
That is, it's so, yeah, it's so funny.

141
00:07:13,540 --> 00:07:16,180
It's just like my cousin will order a salad

142
00:07:16,180 --> 00:07:18,780
and my dad will like lean into the table

143
00:07:18,780 --> 00:07:20,860
and be like, "It's kind of fruity."

144
00:07:20,860 --> 00:07:21,700
- Yeah.

145
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:22,520
- And then he just crushes.

146
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:25,460
- Yeah, the funny uncle is such a funny,

147
00:07:25,460 --> 00:07:27,540
'cause yeah, it never translates.

148
00:07:27,540 --> 00:07:28,380
- Oh yeah.

149
00:07:28,380 --> 00:07:31,280
- It's always that the person, that the family member

150
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:34,420
found like one or two jokes that like really work

151
00:07:34,420 --> 00:07:37,900
like 10 years ago and you never have to come up

152
00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:38,740
with new stuff.

153
00:07:38,740 --> 00:07:39,560
- The funny uncle--

154
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:40,400
- Are you kidding me?

155
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:41,220
I'm a family member.

156
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:42,060
- I'm trying out all my new material on my nephew's knees.

157
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:43,460
You're not the funny family member.

158
00:07:43,460 --> 00:07:47,660
The funny uncle is also just the one who, the uncle who's the most drunk at everything.

159
00:07:47,660 --> 00:07:48,660
Yeah.

160
00:07:48,660 --> 00:07:49,660
That's the funny one.

161
00:07:49,660 --> 00:07:50,660
I know.

162
00:07:50,660 --> 00:07:51,780
See, that's what I'm saying.

163
00:07:51,780 --> 00:07:53,780
It's funny when the uncle, it's funny when you...

164
00:07:53,780 --> 00:07:55,420
He's funny because he falls asleep.

165
00:07:55,420 --> 00:07:56,420
Yeah.

166
00:07:56,420 --> 00:07:57,420
Yeah.

167
00:07:57,420 --> 00:08:00,380
It's funny when you make your nephew get you a beer and...

168
00:08:00,380 --> 00:08:02,980
Yeah, and then pretend that you're going to let him have some.

169
00:08:02,980 --> 00:08:03,980
Yeah.

170
00:08:03,980 --> 00:08:04,980

177
00:08:20,660 --> 00:08:25,500
funny when you pretend to get mad at them and then say, "Why you little..." and then

178
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:31,180
pretend to throw them. I need to get some nephews, bro. I need to get some nephews.

They're big for turtles, they're human sized.

00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:36,780
Understatement of the century.

348

Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles are big for turtles.

00:18:38,780 --> 00:18:40,780
They're huge for turtles.

Yeah.

390

Yeah, yeah.

You ever see, they're like, you could get, they're like, they did like crayons that were

395
00:21:49,180 --> 00:21:50,180
Yeah.

396
00:21:50,180 --> 00:21:53,580
There was like one where there's like just like 10 different skin color crayons.

397
00:21:53,580 --> 00:21:54,580
Really?

398
00:21:54,580 --> 00:21:56,300
It's a bunch, like it's every possible skin color.

399
00:21:56,300 --> 00:21:57,300
That's powerful.

400
00:21:57,300 --> 00:21:58,300
They're all called skin.

401
00:21:58,300 --> 00:21:59,300
That's really powerful.

402
00:21:59,300 --> 00:22:00,300
Yeah.

403
00:22:00,300 --> 00:22:01,300
It's actually cool.

404
00:22:01,300 --> 00:22:02,300
It's like flesh color band-aids.

405
00:22:02,300 --> 00:22:03,300
It's like, what I'm gonna draw with these.

406
00:22:03,300 --> 00:22:06,860
They're all like, they're like, like, like pinkish brown.

407
00:22:06,860 --> 00:22:12,660
these are you can draw the people of the world you never thought about that huh

408
00:22:12,660 --> 00:22:17,220
you can't draw I feel like I feel like crayon draw black plant shut up you can't

409
00:22:17,220 --> 00:22:20,580
there's a black plan I would much rather have like red and green and yellow and

410
00:22:20,580 --> 00:22:27,140
blue than every skin color racist racist much I don't know if you're red green

411
00:22:27,140 --> 00:22:32,700
blue or purple okay if your skin skin skin skin or skin it's all skin to me

412
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:38,060
Have you seen the skin colored band-aid? Have you seen that shit?

413
00:22:38,060 --> 00:22:40,380
Are they doing black flesh colored band-aids yet?

414
00:22:40,380 --> 00:22:40,780
Yeah.

415
00:22:40,780 --> 00:22:42,860
Really? That's funny.

416
00:22:42,860 --> 00:22:45,980
I never realized that band-aids were supposed to be flesh colored. I thought

417
00:22:45,980 --> 00:22:47,900
they were supposed to be band-aid colored.

418
00:22:47,900 --> 00:22:49,580
Yeah. Yeah. I kind of...

419
00:22:49,580 --> 00:22:51,500
I never had that thought.

420
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:52,140
Racist.

421
00:22:52,140 --> 00:22:55,820
I never had that thought until those band-aids came out and then I was like, damn,

422
00:22:55,820 --> 00:22:57,820
I do not look like a band-aid.

423
00:22:57,820 --> 00:22:59,900
It's not like it's going to blend in.

424
00:23:02,380 --> 00:23:05,100
It's honestly grosser if it looks the color of your skin.

425
00:23:05,100 --> 00:23:06,100
Yeah, right.

426
00:23:06,100 --> 00:23:08,700
What the fuck is wrong with you and that one little area?

427
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:10,340
There's a huge bump on your leg.

428
00:23:10,340 --> 00:23:13,900
Why do you have a pill-shaped area of your body that looks like shit?

429
00:23:13,900 --> 00:23:14,900
Yeah.

430
00:23:14,900 --> 00:23:15,900
And it's falling off.

431
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:18,580
You have tiny holes on a pill-shaped area of your body.

432
00:23:18,580 --> 00:23:19,580
Yeah, exactly.

433
00:23:19,580 --> 00:23:20,580
The tryptophobes gonna hate that.

434
00:23:20,580 --> 00:23:22,620
I like the band-aids with characters on them.

435
00:23:22,620 --> 00:23:23,620
Yeah.

436
00:23:23,620 --> 00:23:24,620
Dude, I would...

437
00:23:24,620 --> 00:23:25,620
That's good for the characters.

438
00:23:25,620 --> 00:23:26,620
I went to...

439
00:23:26,620 --> 00:23:27,620
Skin.

440
00:23:27,620 --> 00:23:28,620
Oh, dude.

441
00:23:28,620 --> 00:23:29,620
I didn't realize how...

442
00:23:29,620 --> 00:23:33,380
If you're Spongebob, a Spongebob band-aid's gonna look pretty damn fine on you.

443
00:23:33,380 --> 00:23:34,180
That's a good point.

444
00:23:34,180 --> 00:23:34,820
Yeah.

445
00:23:34,820 --> 00:23:36,820
How come there ain't no Caleb band-aid yet?

446
00:23:36,820 --> 00:23:37,940
They can't, you can probably make 'em.

447
00:23:37,940 --> 00:23:42,820
They don't, they're not like M&Ms, you can't get 'em custom made, you fucking...

448
00:23:42,820 --> 00:23:44,820
If not, band-aids should jump on that.

449
00:23:44,820 --> 00:23:45,860
They absolutely should.

450
00:23:45,860 --> 00:23:52,580
I went to, I think last Saturday, two Saturdays ago, went to Dave & Buster's.

451
00:23:52,580 --> 00:23:53,380
Yep.

452
00:23:53,380 --> 00:23:54,660
Some people went there.

453
00:23:54,660 --> 00:23:58,500
And I cut my thumb open before I got there.

454
00:23:59,380 --> 00:24:01,980
So I had to use all my points to buy band-aids.

455
00:24:01,980 --> 00:24:03,540
Did you do it as a joke?

456
00:24:03,540 --> 00:24:07,300
No, I was skating before I went there.

457
00:24:07,300 --> 00:24:07,900
And then...

458
00:24:07,900 --> 00:24:09,500
At Razor Park?

459
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:12,260
I think I cut my thumb on my truck.

460
00:24:12,260 --> 00:24:13,700
Or something.

461
00:24:13,700 --> 00:24:15,340
You tried to grind a needle.

462
00:24:15,340 --> 00:24:16,260
Yeah.

463
00:24:16,260 --> 00:24:19,860
I was grinding a straight razor at the barbershop.

464
00:24:19,860 --> 00:24:21,460
Because you're one foot tall.

465
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:24,140
We could buy custom printed band-aids.

466
00:24:24,140 --> 00:24:26,780
I had to spend $300...

467
00:24:26,780 --> 00:24:29,300
I mean points at Dave & Buster's.

468
00:24:29,300 --> 00:24:31,880
on you also spent three hundred dollars

469
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:32,720
yeah

470
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:35,000
that's different story

471
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:39,720
i spent three hundred points on band aids and the only thing that the only

472
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:42,620
money i had her points i had left was

473
00:24:42,620 --> 00:24:44,240
enough to buy

474
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:45,800
dracula teeth

475
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:50,840
nice so they're going to be a i want to get a custom and a_b_s_ says fucked up

476
00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:53,160
police and a m_a_

477
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:56,200
this custom band aids you can like upload a uh...

478
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:58,040
image file

479
00:24:58,040 --> 00:24:59,200
to the band aid

480
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:03,120
And the minimum amount you can order is $5,000.

481
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:06,200
The minimum price is $2,000.

482
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:06,880
What?

483
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:07,680
How much is--

484
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:08,640
On this website.

485
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:09,140
What the--

486
00:25:09,140 --> 00:25:10,180
Maybe there's another way.

487
00:25:10,180 --> 00:25:11,000
How much are these expensive Band-Aids, dude?

488
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:11,920
What the fuck?

489
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:12,560
That's crazy.

490
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:15,960
It's $0.39 per custom printed Band-Aid.

491
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:17,720
And then there's a setup cost.

492
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:18,720
That's awful, dude.

493
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:20,600
But we might have to do a run, though, low key.

494
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:23,880
But hey, if you order $25,000 or more,

495
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:26,360
it's only $0.31 per Band-Aid.

496
00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:28,440
Should we do a Band-Aid merch drop?

497
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:29,440
We should.

498
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:32,440
How much would it cost to order 25,000 band-aids?

499
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:34,440
That's like not a bad idea.

500
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:35,440
7,800 dollars.

501
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:36,440
Let's just do it.

502
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:38,440
The band-aids I got did not work.

503
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:40,440
You got defective band-aids.

504
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:42,440
Well, they were prank band-aids.

505
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:43,440
Yeah, they were pineapple shaped.

506
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:45,440
From Dave and Buster, you got...

507
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:46,440
You bought a sticker.

508
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:47,440
Basically.

509
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:48,440
Yeah.

510
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:50,440
I bought stickers to fix my thumb.

511
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:51,440
Yeah, how'd that work out for you?

512
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:52,440
Didn't work out that well.

513
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:53,440
Big shot.

514
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:54,440
Yeah.

515
00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:55,440
Hot shot.

516
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:56,440
You think you're hot shit, hot shot?

517
00:25:56,440 --> 00:25:57,440
Who's there with us?

518
00:25:57,440 --> 00:26:05,560
matter no one cares I love that Dave and Buster's trip with my friends that you

519
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:09,560
guys didn't go on even though I invited you and you said no Patrick's every

520
00:26:09,560 --> 00:26:13,840
story that Patrick tells has a beginning middle and and list of everybody who was

521
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:20,880
there at the time yeah that's why we didn't ask him about his Thanksgiving

522
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:27,400
I ate turkey and then I left and my mom was there and my dad was there and my

523
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:33,360
sister was there shout out to my sister yo if you're listening sis you popped

524
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:46,680
off at Thanksgiving she did do she's good she made chocolate soup yeah I was

525
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:52,840
gonna let that play out just because I was like and here's a world-famous

526
00:26:52,840 --> 00:27:00,600
chocolate syrup with ice cubes in it yeah it's a chocolate gazpacho chocolate soup

527
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:05,700
but that's literally like I feel like it's probably like the you know like the

528
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:09,960
aunt Myrna's party cheese salad like everyone's like grandma has some

529
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:15,360
disgusting 1950s recipe that they bring to like Thanksgiving yours no sweet

530
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:20,280
potato souffle. Yeah, like shit like that. That was really good. It was good, but it

531
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:24,560
looks fucked and weird and it has eggs in it. Some weird grandma recipe like that. I hit

532
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:28,800
my Nana up for that one. Mm-hmm. Have you seen the little Aunt Myrna's party cheese

533
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:33,640
salad will be making an appearance at my next Thanksgiving. I hate hitting up my Nana for

534
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:39,160
for fucking recipes, bro. She has this old ass recipe book. It's like from like 1910,

535
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:43,720
right? She just sends me the recipe cards and I just have to hope there's not like Brazil

536
00:27:43,720 --> 00:28:00,320
nuts isn't an ingredient. I'm like I'm not making this. It's always fucking awful.

537
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:06,240
And I'll be like what is like fucking what is China man's afro and she'll

538
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:15,200
be like oh that's parsley. It's always some crazy ingredient that just doesn't exist.

539
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:18,560
Just like some fucking stupid shit they used to call it back then. Yeah.

540
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:23,920
Shit there was one thing called like creamed cutter. I was like what is this? It's milk.

541
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:30,480
It's just like milk or half and half. Okay whatever. They had this candy. Yeah it's always

542
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:35,300
some weird ingredient that they use a like stick and ass pick. Yeah. And yeah, I

543
00:28:35,300 --> 00:28:38,900
have to have it explained to me. And then also none of it is weighted. It's always

544
00:28:38,900 --> 00:28:44,160
just like one box of whatever. It's like I don't think boxes are the same size now

545
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:48,180
as they were in 1910. Right, like you're putting like a whole box of like powdered

546
00:28:48,180 --> 00:28:53,740
mashed potatoes. Yeah, exactly. Yeah. Those are kind of good. Back then every box was

547
00:28:53,740 --> 00:28:57,960
the same size. Yeah, standard. That was a... Well, there was like there were like

548
00:28:57,960 --> 00:29:01,000
ten boxes in the world that they like switched off using.

549
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,160
That was an imperial measurement.

550
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:04,160
And they were wooden boxes.

551
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:05,160
One box.

552
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:06,160
One box.

553
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:07,160
Yeah.

554
00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:08,160
They were all made of wood.

555
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:09,160
They were East India Trading Company boxes.

556
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:10,160
Yeah.

557
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:12,160
Yeah, just a thing that had a seal on it.

558
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:13,160
I think if-

559
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:14,160
There's a lot of blood on them.

560
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:17,760
I think if we went back in time, I might be one of the heads of the East India Trading

561
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:18,760
Co.

562
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:19,760
Yeah?

563
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:20,760
Yeah.

564
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:21,760
I'd be a famous movie star.

565
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:22,760
I don't think you would.

566
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:23,760
Yeah.

567
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:24,760
Oh, dude, are you kidding me?

568
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:25,760
I'd be such a good silent film star.

569
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:26,760
I'd probably be a computer programmer.

570
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:27,760
When?

571
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:34,880
in 1600 and 21 if we went back to the 1910 1920s Cameron be the greatest

572
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:39,240
computer programmer of all time no I'm gonna be the first I'm gonna be a 1600s

573
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:44,280
computer programmer I'd go back in time and I do I do Lenny Bruce's shit like a

574
00:29:44,280 --> 00:29:56,960
year before I'm just gone stage but I'm gonna go back in pee I'm gonna go back

575
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:59,560
One of the greatest comics that ever lived.

576
00:29:59,560 --> 00:30:01,360
Stinky poopy wiener!

577
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:02,760
My socks smell!

578
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:10,460
He got on that stage for three days and the cops came in and destroyed every set that he

579
00:30:10,460 --> 00:30:11,960
tried to do but he was fighting for his freedom.

580
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:14,160
Let me say, you can't see butt on stage!

581
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:15,160
Hey!

582
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:16,280
Gah gah gah gah gah gah!

583
00:30:16,280 --> 00:30:17,280
Get down!

584
00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:18,280
Get down off that stage!

585
00:30:18,280 --> 00:30:19,960
What did I just hear you say?

586
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:20,960
Stinky poop!

587
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:22,680
I'm gonna wash you!

588
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:26,160
You're gonna have six days in jail and each day I'm gonna wash your mouth out with soap!

589
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:31,280
I'm gonna eat a diaper. Oh that's the other punishment we were gonna do but he

590
00:30:31,280 --> 00:30:38,560
just said it. I'm gonna go back to the 1800s and do Tim and Eric. Change the course of history.

591
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:43,760
You should do like it's like Shakespeare and you doing Tim and Eric stuff.

592
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:49,920
Yeah you're doing the office sketch. You're doing like Tim and Eric bits like as

593
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:54,000
like a Civil War performer yeah and they're like writing home to their wives

594
00:30:54,000 --> 00:31:01,040
and it's like, "Well, darling, it's the strangest damn thing. He mixed up a bat and an owl."

595
00:31:01,040 --> 00:31:06,720
There's a drummer boy who can't finish a sentence without stuttering.

596
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:11,840
"He was just so damn awkward. It made me cringe."

597
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:15,040
There's a difference between a pregnant pause and an awkward pause,

598
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:18,400
and this drummer boy, he toes the line near perfectly.

599
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:22,680
my dearest martha

600
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:25,240
it's been very cold out here in the

601
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:27,400
in the winter months of

602
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:29,140
december something

603
00:31:29,140 --> 00:31:30,140
i don't know

604
00:31:30,140 --> 00:31:32,100
uh... anyway

605
00:31:32,100 --> 00:31:33,700
i watched this guy

606
00:31:33,700 --> 00:31:36,580
diarrhea into a pair of pants

607
00:31:36,580 --> 00:31:39,840
they're plastic pants and then the pants spilled out at the bottom

608
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:43,360
i didn't even know we had plastic back in these times

609
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:48,000
there's a fella been coming around the camps recently goes by the name of meatwad

610
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:52,000
funniest damn shit I've ever seen.

611
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,000
Well, I wouldn't have...

612
00:31:54,000 --> 00:32:00,000
He's driving in his car, he's living like a star.

613
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:06,000
Well, he said, well, I mean, these days would be almost unbearable if

614
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:09,000
that boy Spaghet hadn't come around.

615
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:14,000
If it weren't for you, my darling, and of course, Metalocalypse.

616
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:17,200
That Nathan Explosion can really play a guitar.

617
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:18,400
Oh no, he didn't play the guitar.

618
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:20,200
NOOOOO!

619
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:20,700
FUCK!

620
00:32:20,700 --> 00:32:21,200
FUCK!

621
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:21,700
I WANT THE BILL!

622
00:32:21,700 --> 00:32:23,500
Actually, Nathan Explosion did not play the guitar.

623
00:32:23,500 --> 00:32:24,700
He was the singer!

624
00:32:24,700 --> 00:32:26,800
Fucking owned.

625
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:30,500
That William Murderface, he's got the craziest voice, I tell you.

626
00:32:30,500 --> 00:32:33,300
Those damn Venture Brothers.

627
00:32:33,300 --> 00:32:37,000
Always coming around this Civil War act of fools.

628
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:42,500
Well, the damnedest thing happened today.

629
00:32:42,500 --> 00:32:47,140
Uh, what happened?

630
00:32:47,140 --> 00:32:51,660
There was a squid billy.

631
00:32:51,660 --> 00:32:53,900
There was a squid billy.

632
00:32:53,900 --> 00:32:55,300
I seen a squid billy.

633
00:32:55,300 --> 00:32:57,220
I saw a squid billy outside.

634
00:32:57,220 --> 00:32:58,700
Yeah, it's like a jackalope.

635
00:32:58,700 --> 00:33:02,740
It's like a new folklore creature.

636
00:33:02,740 --> 00:33:04,940
There's a creature, we'll call him a squid billy.

637
00:33:04,940 --> 00:33:09,540
He sat on his porch, couldn't understand a word he said.

638
00:33:09,540 --> 00:33:14,340
he had a shotgun and he pointed it at me or something.

639
00:33:14,340 --> 00:33:18,980
A strange fella named Oblong came by.

640
00:33:18,980 --> 00:33:24,420
I would go back to the first late night show and I would just do Eric Andre for the first

641
00:33:24,420 --> 00:33:25,420
one.

642
00:33:25,420 --> 00:33:26,420
Yeah, that'd be cool.

643
00:33:26,420 --> 00:33:28,860
And that's Jack Parr just going on there.

644
00:33:28,860 --> 00:33:32,340
You push Jack Parr over, start taking a shit on his mouth or something.

645
00:33:32,340 --> 00:33:33,340
Teabagging him.

646
00:33:33,340 --> 00:33:34,580
Asking him what if it was purple.

647
00:33:34,580 --> 00:33:36,620
But it's ruining late night.

648
00:33:36,620 --> 00:33:40,620
because it never starts because of that.

649
00:33:40,620 --> 00:33:44,620
We could let this on TV, no way!

650
00:33:44,620 --> 00:33:48,620
We would not have gone to Iraq.

651
00:33:48,620 --> 00:33:52,620
We would have saved everything.

652
00:33:52,620 --> 00:33:56,620
We have to send Eric Contre back in time.

653
00:33:56,620 --> 00:34:00,620
That's what's going to stop. To destroy American culture.

654
00:34:00,620 --> 00:34:04,620
Because I mean, no late night TV,

655
00:34:04,620 --> 00:34:08,080
None of this counterculture starts. We're all in a straight and narrow.

656
00:34:08,080 --> 00:34:09,080
Yeah.

657
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:11,280
None of these hippies.

658
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:12,280
Mm-hmm.

659
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:14,280
Ruining society in the 60s.

660
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:15,280
Damn hippies.

661
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:16,280
Oh my god.

662
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:17,280
Get a freaking haircut.

663
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:21,280
Honestly, it sucks that hippies are still around and that they're so annoying.

664
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:22,280
Yep.

665
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:23,880
Dude, they're the most annoying people in the world.

666
00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:28,040
I hate hippies. They basically, they smell bad and they look ugly.

667
00:34:28,040 --> 00:34:30,280
Take your leather jacket off, you fucking hippo.

668
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:37,560
Yeah, these hippies walking around with their scarves drinking their who knows what Starbucks choco latte or whatever the hell

669
00:34:37,560 --> 00:34:46,200
Listening to the Arctic monkeys all the time supposed to be black. That's right. That's right. Take your damn skinny jeans off and let me

670
00:34:46,200 --> 00:34:53,040
These hipsters walk around their skinny jeans take a model. Let me suck your cock

671
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:56,600
Take off your pants on your attempt

672
00:34:56,600 --> 00:34:59,320
Show me the balls. I

673
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:02,080

781
00:41:02,420 --> 00:41:08,220
Oh these these these kids are living like this meanwhile there's Korean slaves all

782
00:41:08,220 --> 00:41:14,160
over the country. Yeah. Is that true? I don't even know. K-pop is Korean slavery. That's

783
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:19,060
South Korea. That's, but that's where, you said Korean slaves all over the world? Over

784
00:41:19,060 --> 00:41:24,480
the country you said. Oh, okay. I think North Korea people say that, South Koreans like say

785
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:28,240
they have slaves and then they're like, what, they're like yeah I was in a labor camp and

786
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:32,940
then the interviewer's like what happened and they're like they tickled me and they made

787
00:41:32,940 --> 00:41:41,060
me smile. Yeah. Yeah, we're pro DPRK here. I honestly, I don't care. I don't care. I don't

788
00:41:41,060 --> 00:41:44,360
really care what any, I don't know what goes on there. I don't care if China is like killing

789
00:41:44,360 --> 00:41:49,740
a million people. China's awesome. China rules, dude. Yeah, I love China more than America.

790
00:41:49,740 --> 00:41:54,100
But I love America probably just as equal as I do China. I wish my parents taught me

791
00:41:54,100 --> 00:42:01,340
Chinese as a kid so I could move there. Yeah. And I trust pretty much any country that will

792
00:42:01,340 --> 00:42:09,060
eventually rule us yeah China maybe like China's like don't be France like

793
00:42:09,060 --> 00:42:12,740
someone Oh Iger Muslim like fine I'll just be normal I'll be like Vinnie Paz

794
00:42:12,740 --> 00:42:17,380
style Muslim then mm-hmm like you're not gonna put you tell me you're gonna put a

795
00:42:17,380 --> 00:42:21,900
hundred million Vinnie Paz's into a labor camp oh yeah you imagine the songs that

796
00:42:21,900 --> 00:42:28,780
would come out of there yeah the spirituals the video crazy row like God

797
00:42:28,780 --> 00:42:29,780
Also, imagine trying to-

798
00:42:29,780 --> 00:42:34,900
Honestly, there would be so many truths in those songs that they would have to kill you

799
00:42:34,900 --> 00:42:35,900
immediately.

800
00:42:35,900 --> 00:42:39,780
Bro, there's not enough fucking rice slop in the world to feed those slaves.

801
00:42:39,780 --> 00:42:42,740
You'd probably be like, "I'm treated like a slave.

802
00:42:42,740 --> 00:42:44,340
My leader should be in their grave."

803
00:42:44,340 --> 00:42:45,340
You'd probably say that.

804
00:42:45,340 --> 00:42:47,980
And then, "You're a knave."

805
00:42:47,980 --> 00:42:48,980
You're naïve.

806
00:42:48,980 --> 00:42:49,980
Yeah, and naïve.

807
00:42:49,980 --> 00:42:54,700
And stuff like that would be probably really hard-hitting.

808
00:42:54,700 --> 00:42:59,140
kidding. They're probably just make more songs about like being in the civil

809
00:42:59,140 --> 00:42:59,840
war and stuff

810
00:42:59,840 --> 00:43:06,760
it's like yeah story. So King Arthur at the round table

811
00:43:06,760 --> 00:43:12,060
Merlin the shit he gave me got me twirling.

812
00:43:12,060 --> 00:43:18,600
It is funny just to be a conscious rapper. I've new run out of Bush Bush

813
00:43:18,600 --> 00:43:24,460
gets he's not the president anymore and then you just have to start doing the

814
00:43:24,460 --> 00:43:31,680
Yeah, you have to be doing the fucking yeah, yeah, you do fucking what's it called the magic treehouse books

815
00:43:31,680 --> 00:43:51,000
Yeah, you run out of like historical events

816
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:54,400
you start doing the ones where it's like they went to the rainforest to like meet

817
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:57,300
gorillas or something. It's like not even like...

818
00:43:57,300 --> 00:44:00,460
Was it just to teach kids that like this thing exists?

819
00:44:00,460 --> 00:44:03,700
Did they ever do the future in the magic treehouse? They should have. I don't know.

820
00:44:03,700 --> 00:44:08,700
I used to tear through those books. Yeah, I loved those. I loved them. I used to listen to them in an audiobook when I was little.

821
00:44:08,700 --> 00:44:12,700
I'm smoking dope in an igloo with the Eskimo.

822
00:44:12,700 --> 00:44:15,700
Basically they got a hundred words for snow.

823
00:44:15,700 --> 00:44:17,940
(laughing)

824
00:44:17,940 --> 00:44:23,140
- That was fire.

825
00:44:23,140 --> 00:44:25,960
- I'm a caveman, I'm treated like a slave, man.

826
00:44:25,960 --> 00:44:27,940
(laughing)

827
00:44:27,940 --> 00:44:30,540
I got hit with a rock, now I'm in my grave, man.

828
00:44:30,540 --> 00:44:32,380
(laughing)

829
00:44:32,380 --> 00:44:34,260
- I'm at the Gettysburg address.

830
00:44:34,260 --> 00:44:37,780
This civil war will be the baddest.

831
00:44:37,780 --> 00:44:39,740
- It's cool, dude.

832
00:44:39,740 --> 00:44:41,100
- Freed the slaves, man.

833
00:44:41,100 --> 00:44:43,780
- That's a cool ass gimmick to have as a rapper.

834
00:44:43,780 --> 00:44:44,620
- Yeah, dude.

835
00:44:44,620 --> 00:44:46,620
Yeah, time traveling.

836
00:44:46,620 --> 00:44:48,620
Yeah, that is actually really cool.

837
00:44:48,620 --> 00:44:50,620
Rhyme unraveling.

838
00:44:50,620 --> 00:44:52,620
That's what he does. Vinnie Pat's a creator.

839
00:44:52,620 --> 00:44:54,620
Yeah.

840
00:44:54,620 --> 00:44:56,620
I like that he has a super group that has like

841
00:44:56,620 --> 00:44:58,620
30 white guys in it called Army of the Pharaohs.

842
00:44:58,620 --> 00:45:00,620
That's so cool.

843
00:45:00,620 --> 00:45:02,620
It's really cool.

844
00:45:02,620 --> 00:45:04,620
And they think the Necronomicon is real.

845
00:45:04,620 --> 00:45:06,620
That's like their whole thing.

846
00:45:06,620 --> 00:45:08,620
That's what being a white Muslim

847
00:45:08,620 --> 00:45:10,620
rapper is about. Pretty much.

848
00:45:10,620 --> 00:45:12,620
It's about, yeah, you believe in evil dead.

849
00:45:12,620 --> 00:45:17,180
Yeah, you're like, yeah, we believe in Islam. The boogeyman is real. He lives under my bed.

850
00:45:17,180 --> 00:45:19,420
Yeah, the Ninja Turtles are real.

851
00:45:19,420 --> 00:45:22,060
The Ninja Turtles are real. Yeah, well, he's also the conspiracy.

852
00:45:22,060 --> 00:45:23,500
Yeah, the government's hiding a Ninja Turtle.

853
00:45:23,500 --> 00:45:27,100
Yeah, he's like, 9/11 is an inside job. Godzilla exists.

854
00:45:27,100 --> 00:45:28,780
Yep, I'm a werewolf.

855
00:45:28,780 --> 00:45:30,380
Yeah, plus I'm a werewolf, though.

856
00:45:30,380 --> 00:45:34,220
Werewolves are still the funniest conspiracy theory to me.

857
00:45:34,220 --> 00:45:34,620
Yeah.

858
00:45:34,620 --> 00:45:38,700
People who think that the government is covering up the existence of werewolves.

859
00:45:38,700 --> 00:45:42,300
I think if the government made a werewolf, they would make me one because it's a perfect cover.

860
00:45:42,300 --> 00:45:46,220
That's just so funny over like aliens or ghosts or even like zombies.

861
00:45:46,220 --> 00:45:47,820
Like werewolves is like...

862
00:45:47,820 --> 00:45:49,820
Zombies is like...

863
00:45:49,820 --> 00:45:51,820
Even the creature from the Black Lagoon.

864
00:45:51,820 --> 00:45:53,820
Even that is like...

865
00:45:53,820 --> 00:45:55,820
I would believe that more like splicing human DNA with a fish.

866
00:45:55,820 --> 00:45:57,820
I would believe it's like...

867
00:45:57,820 --> 00:45:59,820
I would probably believe Santa before I believed werewolves.

868
00:45:59,820 --> 00:46:01,820
Yeah, werewolves is like the last...

869
00:46:01,820 --> 00:46:03,820
You don't?

870
00:46:03,820 --> 00:46:05,820
Believe werewolves?

871
00:46:05,820 --> 00:46:07,820
No. Santa?

872
00:46:07,820 --> 00:46:09,820
I do, that's the point.

873
00:46:09,820 --> 00:46:11,820
Well, okay, so you believe werewolves then, right?

874
00:46:11,820 --> 00:46:16,020
you said before before before I'm not at werewolves yet okay Santa my whole

875
00:46:16,020 --> 00:46:20,060

He's a man. I remember my mom. Give him a big gold hat. I

entertainer had plated in gold. So he can't wear it without

903
00:48:46,320 --> 00:48:48,920
breaking his neck politically. The kings of comedy are not

904
00:48:48,920 --> 00:48:50,420
recognized in awesome land.

905
00:48:50,420 --> 00:48:52,920
They are not treated as kings.

906
00:48:52,920 --> 00:48:54,320
No, that's disrespectful.

907
00:48:54,320 --> 00:48:55,720
You're an acting comedy.

908
00:48:55,720 --> 00:48:59,220
This is the worst place in the world.

909
00:48:59,220 --> 00:49:01,620
You know, you know, you know, like what terrible land, you

910
00:49:01,620 --> 00:49:02,220
know, it's funny.

911
00:49:02,220 --> 00:49:04,220
Awesome land is actually terrible, but terrible.

912
00:49:09,020 --> 00:49:28,820
very

913
00:49:28,820 --> 00:49:37,740

914
00:49:37,740 --> 00:49:48,900

916

920
00:50:15,180 --> 00:50:22,340
yeah yeah Caleb I'm a costume through Caleb like just four year old that yeah

921
00:50:22,340 --> 00:50:26,740
You like threw your head back so that the hat would fly off the boat.

922
00:50:26,740 --> 00:50:29,540
You told an old lady you were gonna kill yourself.

923
00:50:29,540 --> 00:50:30,540
Yeah.

924
00:50:30,540 --> 00:50:31,540
Yeah.

925
00:50:31,540 --> 00:50:32,540
That old lady with the blue colored contacts.

926
00:50:32,540 --> 00:50:35,660
That was the oldest lady I've ever seen in my entire life.

927
00:50:35,660 --> 00:50:37,580
Oldest woman wearing colored contacts.

928
00:50:37,580 --> 00:50:39,740
She was so fucking old.

929
00:50:39,740 --> 00:50:43,940
She was Cameron's like, she literally had like dune like spice eyes.

930
00:50:43,940 --> 00:50:44,940
Yeah she did.

931
00:50:44,940 --> 00:50:47,620
It was so fucking crazy dude.

932
00:50:47,620 --> 00:50:48,660
I think she was.

933
00:50:48,660 --> 00:50:52,440
I think she was a Fremen on that boat sent to give Cameron good luck.

934
00:50:52,440 --> 00:50:53,780
Yeah, she's a friend of mine.

935
00:50:53,780 --> 00:50:56,420
She literally, she was, yeah, I kept running into her.

936
00:50:56,420 --> 00:51:00,140
Yeah, and she kept coming up to you being like, "I just won $400 more dollars."

937
00:51:00,140 --> 00:51:01,140
Yeah.

938
00:51:01,140 --> 00:51:04,380
I was like, "God damn, good for you lady, when are you going to buy more colored contacts?"

939
00:51:04,380 --> 00:51:05,380
That's right.

940
00:51:05,380 --> 00:51:07,700
Old people use all their luck up at the end of their lives at the casino.

941
00:51:07,700 --> 00:51:08,700
Yeah, yeah.

942
00:51:08,700 --> 00:51:09,700
Well, yeah, you don't want to die without any luck left over.

943
00:51:09,700 --> 00:51:10,700
You get a luck buff.

944
00:51:10,700 --> 00:51:11,700
Why don't I have any luck?

945
00:51:11,700 --> 00:51:12,700
At the end of the life.

946
00:51:12,700 --> 00:51:14,340
You got to wait until you're old.

947
00:51:14,340 --> 00:51:15,340
Yeah.

948
00:51:15,340 --> 00:51:16,340
I guess.

949
00:51:16,340 --> 00:51:17,340
That's why I hate gambling now.

950
00:51:17,340 --> 00:51:18,340
I know that when I get older-

951
00:51:18,340 --> 00:51:20,780
hate gambling now. The luck of the Irish is gonna happen. You hate gambling because you

952
00:51:20,780 --> 00:51:25,980
suck crap at it. Once I get so old that my body shrinks down to leprechaun size. How the

953
00:51:25,980 --> 00:51:32,380
fuck are Irish people lucky dude? Irish people's lives are dog shit. What are you talking about?

954
00:51:32,380 --> 00:51:37,740
They're terrible people. There's nothing lucky about Irish people. You guys, you guys, you

955
00:51:37,740 --> 00:51:42,380
guys. Are you okay? You guys escaped. There's so many four leaf clovers in Ireland. You

956
00:51:42,380 --> 00:51:46,900
guys escaped slavery. You guys escaped slavery and were like I guess I'll just drink every

957
00:51:46,900 --> 00:51:51,900
day forever. This is way better than being a slave. And then the one guy who tried to

958
00:51:51,900 --> 00:51:57,940
do anything got his head exploded. The one Irish guy who ever tried to stop being a piece

959
00:51:57,940 --> 00:52:03,340
of shit and do something. What are you talking about? St. Patrick. Yeah, he got assassinated.

960
00:52:03,340 --> 00:52:07,900
He got assassinated by an angry little snake. It was like, "You kicked me out of my apartment

961
00:52:07,900 --> 00:52:12,580
in Ireland." Yeah, that's true. St. Patrick was a landlord. Yeah, all Irish people have

962
00:52:12,580 --> 00:52:15,180
ever done their entire existence of Ireland.

963
00:52:15,180 --> 00:52:16,180
Choose your words carefully.

964
00:52:16,180 --> 00:52:18,340
Just get shit on and fucked.

965
00:52:18,340 --> 00:52:19,340
Pretty much.

966
00:52:19,340 --> 00:52:23,140
And then just make the worst bomb of all time and mostly kill themselves with it.

967
00:52:23,140 --> 00:52:24,140
No.

968
00:52:24,140 --> 00:52:25,140
Yeah.

969
00:52:25,140 --> 00:52:26,140
Are you kidding me dude?

970
00:52:26,140 --> 00:52:27,140
The car bomb deaths?

971
00:52:27,140 --> 00:52:28,140
Yeah.

972
00:52:28,140 --> 00:52:29,140
They got a lot of fuckers with those.

973
00:52:29,140 --> 00:52:31,900
They were still in the car when they set it off.

974
00:52:31,900 --> 00:52:34,660
Oh, I was in the car and I got a key.

975
00:52:34,660 --> 00:52:37,660
Well somebody's got to press the button.

976
00:52:37,660 --> 00:52:40,260
I've never heard of a fuse.

977
00:52:40,260 --> 00:52:43,540
Ireland number one, number one in the world.

978
00:52:43,540 --> 00:52:44,700
Number one is in their pee.

979
00:52:44,700 --> 00:52:46,740
You ever heard, have you ever heard of Crack Boy Mental?

980
00:52:46,740 --> 00:52:48,820
Number one most servile slave.

981
00:52:48,820 --> 00:52:49,660
Yeah.

982
00:52:49,660 --> 00:52:50,500
You heard Crack Boy Mental?

983
00:52:50,500 --> 00:52:51,320
No.

984
00:52:51,320 --> 00:52:53,220
The Irish autistic rapper trying to--

985
00:52:53,220 --> 00:52:54,060
Yeah, I did hear that.

986
00:52:54,060 --> 00:52:55,860
Trying to stop oppression.

987
00:52:55,860 --> 00:52:56,700
I have heard that.

988
00:52:56,700 --> 00:52:59,140
800 years, never again!

989
00:52:59,140 --> 00:53:00,740
I'd like to stop this impression.

990
00:53:00,740 --> 00:53:01,580
Yeah, please don't do it.

991
00:53:01,580 --> 00:53:02,420
Oh my God.

992
00:53:02,420 --> 00:53:05,020
I love Crack Boy Mental.

993
00:53:05,020 --> 00:53:07,260
He's autistic, he has mental in his name?

994
00:53:07,260 --> 00:53:08,300
Yeah.

995
00:53:08,300 --> 00:53:09,460
It's pretty funny.

996
00:53:09,460 --> 00:53:12,820
Well, it's a different meaning over there.

997
00:53:12,820 --> 00:53:13,820
Yeah.

998
00:53:13,820 --> 00:53:14,820
Yeah.

999
00:53:14,820 --> 00:53:16,260
He's bloody mental with his bars.

1000
00:53:16,260 --> 00:53:17,260
Oh, okay.

1001
00:53:17,260 --> 00:53:18,260
Yeah.

1002
00:53:18,260 --> 00:53:20,580
And he's got a mental disorder.

1003
00:53:20,580 --> 00:53:21,580
Yeah.

1004
00:53:21,580 --> 00:53:26,140
How come Pop Smoke can say the R word all he wants?

1005
00:53:26,140 --> 00:53:27,620
Well, isn't he dead?

1006
00:53:27,620 --> 00:53:29,140
Yeah, but nobody even cared.

1007
00:53:29,140 --> 00:53:32,140
I've been listening to you talking about they killed him for it.

1008
00:53:32,140 --> 00:53:33,140
Yeah, exactly.

1009
00:53:33,140 --> 00:53:39,420
He got the death penalty for that.

1010
00:53:39,420 --> 00:53:41,780
a team of young activists

1011
00:53:41,780 --> 00:53:44,340
broken a post looks

1012
00:53:44,340 --> 00:53:47,620
los angeles you know you imagine

1013
00:53:47,620 --> 00:53:48,660
it

1014
00:53:48,660 --> 00:53:52,540
the react to the american like that

1015
00:53:52,540 --> 00:53:54,100
the news cycle

1016
00:53:54,100 --> 00:53:57,060
for like a little like months after that yeah

1017
00:53:57,060 --> 00:54:01,740
yeah i think it's a little bit saying the r_ word yeah

1018
00:54:01,740 --> 00:54:06,220
and i would really that would with that would start the next civil war yeah

1019
00:54:06,220 --> 00:54:09,220
Yeah. But it wouldn't even be state to state.

1020
00:54:09,220 --> 00:54:13,220
What? Like the Civil War, it wouldn't even...

1021
00:54:13,220 --> 00:54:16,980
It's not even like split up evenly like the states.

1022
00:54:16,980 --> 00:54:19,980
It would just be like different houses.

1023
00:54:19,980 --> 00:54:23,020
What are you talking about? You know what I'm saying?

1024
00:54:23,020 --> 00:54:25,060
Are you saying that...

1025
00:54:25,060 --> 00:54:28,900
Are you insinuating that the Civil War would be between mentally challenged people?

1026
00:54:28,900 --> 00:54:31,300
No. No?

1027
00:54:31,300 --> 00:54:34,260
People who want to say it versus people who think you shouldn't say it.

1028
00:54:34,780 --> 00:54:36,780
Oh no, that's a north-south divide.

1029
00:54:36,780 --> 00:54:38,780
I think.

1030
00:54:38,780 --> 00:54:43,780
It'd be the same Mason-Dixie line, but it stretches up, covers Massachusetts.

1031
00:54:43,780 --> 00:54:45,780
That's what I was about to say.

1032
00:54:45,780 --> 00:54:47,780
Only Boston. It's like Boston versus Cambridge.

1033
00:54:47,780 --> 00:54:49,780
Yeah, exactly.

1034
00:54:49,780 --> 00:54:53,780
Boston versus Cambridge.

1035
00:54:53,780 --> 00:54:55,780
That'd be cool, dude.

1036
00:54:55,780 --> 00:55:00,780
Boston versus Cambridge, and then pretty much everywhere else is on Boston's side.

1037
00:55:00,780 --> 00:55:02,780
Yeah, pretty much.

1038
00:55:02,780 --> 00:55:03,900
Except for, oh, Boston.

1039
00:55:03,900 --> 00:55:04,580
It's like eight neighborhoods.

1040
00:55:04,580 --> 00:55:06,060
Boston versus Cambridge and Brookline.

1041
00:55:06,060 --> 00:55:10,540
It would be the eight neighborhoods in the world where there's a, like a...

1042
00:55:10,540 --> 00:55:11,260
That horn.

1043
00:55:11,260 --> 00:55:12,700
You liked the horn.

1044
00:55:12,700 --> 00:55:16,540
You think that's an ice cream truck and you follow the garbage truck all around.

1045
00:55:16,540 --> 00:55:19,340
I think that the ice cream truck shouldn't play a song.

1046
00:55:19,340 --> 00:55:20,780
I think it should play one loud...

1047
00:55:20,780 --> 00:55:23,180
One long...

1048
00:55:23,180 --> 00:55:25,180
One long, like...

1049
00:55:25,180 --> 00:55:26,380
Well, it's easier to hear.

1050
00:55:26,380 --> 00:55:27,260
Yeah, like one...

1051
00:55:27,260 --> 00:55:28,460
It should play like the same...

1052
00:55:28,460 --> 00:55:30,060
It should play like a tornado alarm.

1053
00:55:30,060 --> 00:55:30,540
Yeah.

1054
00:55:30,540 --> 00:55:30,620
Yeah.

1055
00:55:30,620 --> 00:55:31,420
I've saw this before.

1056
00:55:31,420 --> 00:55:34,940
but like a tornado alarm that's not like a law ice cream truck should play a

1057
00:55:34,940 --> 00:55:37,460
really loud car crash sound effect

1058
00:55:37,460 --> 00:55:41,300
so many runs exactly all my pictures repeating

1059
00:55:41,300 --> 00:55:45,580
all my god it's a truck the uh... car crash loop

1060
00:55:45,580 --> 00:55:47,380
screaming

1061
00:55:47,380 --> 00:55:48,180
they should play

1062
00:55:48,180 --> 00:55:51,100
well now gunshots when people run yeah yeah

1063
00:55:51,100 --> 00:55:55,140
what about the quickly put it's a gunshot what if it's like a scream what

1064
00:55:55,140 --> 00:55:58,300
if it plays are really catchy beautiful song

1065
00:55:58,300 --> 00:56:02,740
in that signals the neighborhood that ice cream stir by national anthem

1066
00:56:02,740 --> 00:56:04,300
that's actually not a bad idea

1067
00:56:04,300 --> 00:56:07,180
vision i think they are there are a bit of a large stream trucks that play the

1068
00:56:07,180 --> 00:56:08,880
national and turn it up

1069
00:56:08,880 --> 00:56:10,400
veterans ice cream

1070
00:56:10,400 --> 00:56:14,260
that's my shit you know they only sell the captain america popsicle

1071
00:56:14,260 --> 00:56:16,060
the captain america popsicle

1072
00:56:16,060 --> 00:56:18,920
and they do sell the like the puppets

1073
00:56:18,920 --> 00:56:22,760
do you know if i get those guys i guess i'm here the trial is living in like the

1074
00:56:22,760 --> 00:56:26,860
the marvel universe or whatever and as a veteran i'd be so i'd hate captain

1075
00:56:26,860 --> 00:56:31,660
America so much dude. He got like he got powered up and he has to fight like like

1076
00:56:31,660 --> 00:56:36,580
one guy every year and he's like they call him a troop. He doesn't have to like go

1077
00:56:36,580 --> 00:56:42,860
and... I'm at the VA I'm fucking addicted to heroin. I'm trying to get a $200 check to get me

1078
00:56:42,860 --> 00:56:46,100
through the next six months. He's the most famous guy in the world. Yeah I have

1079
00:56:46,100 --> 00:56:52,620
no legs, no hands. He punched the red skull one time in the 1940s. Yeah. And

1080
00:56:52,620 --> 00:56:54,940
and he's easily is the immortal that

1081
00:56:54,940 --> 00:56:59,900
i literally has to do is i was in vietnam for thirty seconds and i got so scared

1082
00:56:59,900 --> 00:57:03,820
by a guy popping out of a tree that i fell off a cliff here

1083
00:57:03,820 --> 00:57:07,040
and i'm all my leg loss every limb that i have

1084
00:57:07,040 --> 00:57:08,560
you get a shield

1085
00:57:08,560 --> 00:57:11,700
if they have the technology to give the shield they should have been a nice

1086
00:57:11,700 --> 00:57:13,060
little cousin

1087
00:57:13,060 --> 00:57:14,980
because head-blown haha

1088
00:57:14,980 --> 00:57:19,460
why you do what it is make everything out of the shield yeah

1089
00:57:19,460 --> 00:57:26,100
fucking assholes well that's the thing is wakanda's hoarding all that vibranium true yeah what kind of

1090
00:57:26,100 --> 00:57:33,300
bullshit is that? yeah the u.s should invade wakanda. yes sir let's go. u.s should definitely invade wakanda. yeah facts

1091
00:57:33,300 --> 00:57:38,340
well that's the thing about like take the power like what like wakanda's like the secret city

1092
00:57:38,340 --> 00:57:41,700
what the hell were they doing during the freaking holocaust

1093
00:57:44,820 --> 00:57:49,660
It's a good point. You couldn't have sent a Black Panther over there too?

1094
00:57:49,660 --> 00:57:53,980
It's a really good point, yeah.

1095
00:57:53,980 --> 00:57:56,580
Blame Africa for the Holocaust?

1096
00:57:56,580 --> 00:57:59,060
Go ahead Pat.

1097
00:57:59,060 --> 00:58:05,660
This is, we're speaking in MCU terms. So the MCU, I'm a little racist.

1098
00:58:05,660 --> 00:58:12,060
We're all just playing pretend.

1099
00:58:12,060 --> 00:58:17,260
the MCU did was there also was there Nazis and Hydra or is Hydra just the Nazis?

1100
00:58:17,260 --> 00:58:22,140
I think it was there so was there like was there were there like there were

1101
00:58:22,140 --> 00:58:27,960
Nazis and they were like were they superpowered Nazis? Yeah I think Hydra was the evil Nazis.

1102
00:58:27,960 --> 00:58:32,100
Yeah yeah but then the Hydra really just want to be like evil for no reason.

1103
00:58:32,100 --> 00:58:37,540
They don't even have like the whole like Aryan thing. Everyone's gonna be like there's gonna be one person.

1104
00:58:37,540 --> 00:58:41,540
Red Skull's not white, dude. He's red, bro.

1105
00:58:41,540 --> 00:58:47,540
Like, you fucking hate all these other people. You're the only red guy in the whole fucking world.

1106
00:58:47,540 --> 00:58:53,540
There's gonna be somebody who's like mad at us for getting all the lore wrong, and I just want to say to them...

1107
00:58:53,540 --> 00:58:55,540
*blows raspberry*

1108
00:58:55,540 --> 00:58:56,040
Yeah.

1109
00:58:56,040 --> 00:58:57,540
Nerd. Bitch. Fuck you.

1110
00:58:57,540 --> 00:58:58,540
You forgot to take your insulin.

1111
00:58:58,540 --> 00:59:03,540
You try to correct us. You try to correct us on this shit. I'll fuck your mom.

1112
00:59:03,540 --> 00:59:04,040
Yeah.

1113
00:59:04,040 --> 00:59:04,540
What?

1114
00:59:04,540 --> 00:59:16,180
No, no, oh God. You try to correct us on MCU bullshit. I become your new dad. I'm

1115
00:59:16,180 --> 00:59:20,500
gonna fuck your mom's butt. Nothing's off limits. Nothing's off limits. I'm gonna

1116
00:59:20,500 --> 00:59:27,500
I'm gonna fucking. I become your new dad and I show you I show your mom my webs

1117
00:59:27,500 --> 00:59:33,260
like a spider-man. Why didn't spider-man do anything about Adolf Hitler? Yeah, yeah.

1118
00:59:33,260 --> 00:59:38,160
I mean there's so many people who did like totally the Tony Stark doctor

1119
00:59:38,160 --> 00:59:42,700
strange this fucker can control the world go he'd go back in time stop the

1120
00:59:42,700 --> 00:59:47,580
Holocaust he ain't doing shit it is I know everybody said man everybody said

1121
00:59:47,580 --> 00:59:51,820
it a bunch of times before but in like the end of a end game when like Captain

1122
00:59:51,820 --> 00:59:56,260
America like goes back in time and he just used it he just like dances with

1123
00:59:56,260 --> 01:00:06,780
his girlfriend and then dies. He did nothing to help six million people. It's so funny.

1124
01:00:06,780 --> 01:00:12,220
They didn't think that maybe people would realize that they're sending him back. He goes back

1125
01:00:12,220 --> 01:00:20,380
to the 1940s. I will say Hitler did a lot of fucked up shit but he also just ruined any

1126
01:00:20,380 --> 01:00:27,600
movie that where they go back to the 40s. You can't fuck every time travel thing has to

1127
01:00:27,600 --> 01:00:32,640
have some kind of Hitler either Hitler has to have never existed like dude Bill and

1128
01:00:32,640 --> 01:00:36,760
Ted. Yeah they don't do crap they just want to go back and smoke weed with

1129
01:00:36,760 --> 01:00:41,620
Aristotle. Kill Hitler bro. Yeah and you know they would have the funniest Hitler

1130
01:00:41,620 --> 01:00:45,720
kill. Dude. They would kill him with rock and roll. You know what the problem with killing

1131
01:00:45,720 --> 01:00:52,320
Hitler is is that uh funny Hitler's son would be become like an evil Batman and

1132
01:00:52,320 --> 01:00:58,080
would be even more powerful than Hitler. It's actually better just to let him become Green Goblin's son.

1133
01:00:58,080 --> 01:01:02,160
Yeah exactly. Oh yeah. Yeah Green Goblin's like the Hitler in New York City.

1134
01:01:02,160 --> 01:01:08,160
It's true. It's facts. Green. Yeah. Yeah. Big-ass green motherfucker. He's a German

1135
01:01:08,160 --> 01:01:13,080
goblin. Yeah. What? I don't know. I was gonna say Kraut Goblin but then it's like.

1136
01:01:13,080 --> 01:01:14,080
like

1137
01:01:14,080 --> 01:01:15,240
crowd goblins kind of a cool

1138
01:01:15,240 --> 01:01:18,920
yes a cool cool phrase

1139
01:01:18,920 --> 01:01:19,920
yeah

1140
01:01:19,920 --> 01:01:23,800
that's me that's me that's me when i get a coney island dog i'm putting so much damn

1141
01:01:23,800 --> 01:01:24,800
sour crowd on that

1142
01:01:24,800 --> 01:01:26,040
you're a crap goblin basically

1143
01:01:26,040 --> 01:01:28,720
and a cap goblin

1144
01:01:28,720 --> 01:01:33,560
you could try to go back in time and let hitler into art school to prevent everything but

1145
01:01:33,560 --> 01:01:37,200
then he still does all the same shit but all his like battle plans just look way nicer

1146
01:01:37,200 --> 01:01:39,460
(laughter)

1147
01:01:39,460 --> 01:01:41,840
- It's like a really like,

1148
01:01:41,840 --> 01:01:44,260
lovingly painted landscape.

1149
01:01:44,260 --> 01:01:48,100
- It looks like a Lord of the Rings map.

1150
01:01:48,100 --> 01:01:52,200
- I mean, one of history's most evil people of all time,

1151
01:01:52,200 --> 01:01:55,420
but his, I mean, god damn, do you see,

1152
01:01:55,420 --> 01:01:56,660
look at this map of Poland.

1153
01:01:56,660 --> 01:01:59,180
- Yeah, it's beautiful. - Oh, it's gorgeous.

1154
01:01:59,180 --> 01:02:00,560
- Absolutely beautiful.

1155
01:02:00,560 --> 01:02:02,940
- We're done.

1156
01:02:02,940 --> 01:02:03,780
- We're done?

1157
01:02:03,780 --> 01:02:06,660
- We're done, it's been an hour and two minutes.

1158
01:02:06,660 --> 01:02:07,940
Let's go for an hour and three.

1159
01:02:07,940 --> 01:02:09,180
Alright, I gotta go.

1160
01:02:09,180 --> 01:02:10,180
59.

1161
01:02:10,180 --> 01:02:11,180
Suck my dick, bitch.

1162
01:02:11,180 --> 01:02:12,180
Bye!
