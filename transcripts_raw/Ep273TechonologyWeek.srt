00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:10,280
- Cheers my friends.

3
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:12,320
- Technology week, cheers to technology week.

00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:14,240
- Cheers to a thousand years more

5
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:16,140
of this technological war.

6
00:00:16,140 --> 00:00:18,800
Thank you for being here, my two friends.

7
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:20,520
- This is what I eat and drink.

8
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:21,840
- Thank you for being a trend.

9
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:22,680
- Thank you for being a trend.

10
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:23,580
- A trending topic.

11
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:27,560
- A trending topic, a friendly mop that's got to--

12
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:28,400
- Speaks in cop--

13
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:33,760
bucket friend and cop what a friendly mop that's got a bucket friend. The mop is

14
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:38,480
glopping and slopping in the future across the floor. You know what's amazing?

15
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:43,200
I just realised the other day, probably in ten years, no fucking janitors.

16
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:47,280
It's all just going to be robots. We don't have to ever have a janitor again.

17
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:52,040
I saw one of the Stop and Shop robo following around a guy at Stop and Shop,

18
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:55,200
and by Stop and Shop, I think I mean Market Basket. Nope, I'm thinking of

19
00:00:55,200 --> 00:01:00,040
stop and shop and shop and shop. This was over the holidays. This is our it

20
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:03,520
chased a guy. Guy came in and it started walking right behind him. You didn't see

21
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:07,560
a robot chasing man. It you it was literally this man a slug. He was

22
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:11,320
walking and then he turned around and he he got really scared. There's a robot

23
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:15,640
on the robots chasing him because he's leaving a that's why you know they have

24
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:19,880
those cleaning robots, but they're for security, but they try to make them

25
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:24,760
appear a little less. There's the eye. This robot, this is a way scarier than

26
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:28,360
not because it was that with the eyes, but it was also dressed as Santa Claus.

27
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:32,400
Oh you horrifying, so it had eyes and a beard right under its eyes.

28
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:37,880
Is our first the logical the next step is you had hair yeah. This is our first

29
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:41,200
episode back since Christmas break. Basically, our first one all together in

30
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:44,640
the stew. A lot of stuff happened without a lot of stuff without random parasites

31
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:49,320
jacking our style true. What's gone on random parasites jacking our talking

32
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:54,400
about e one? Oh yes, well do not basically trying to take over our first

33
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:57,940
premium so to hear take it over. They're begging us. Please can we do another

34
00:01:57,940 --> 00:02:02,040
collab? I'm like I really don't want to actually kind of like riding so yeah. I

35
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:05,380
like riding solo with my two friends that were together are three. I like

36
00:02:05,380 --> 00:02:05,740
riding

37
00:02:05,740 --> 00:02:09,260
our triple tandem bike to get okay. Speaking of three friends,

38
00:02:09,260 --> 00:02:14,960
here's a different amount of a different type of person. Okay, I went and saw the

39
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:19,560
iron claw and so did I let's talk about let's talk. Let's talk okay. So I didn't

40
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:22,960
see it. First of all, I'm going to give spoilers and but there's no spoiler

41
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,960
morning here. You don't turn it off if you don't because it's a real story, so

42
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:29,560
the real thing is what I feel. I feel the same now first here. I'm going to

43
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:32,880
first tell a story about my experience. Then I'll have a question. Okay, can you

44
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:37,920
during this movie? Everybody dies in the movie fucking everybody is Christ. I

45
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:40,880
don't know anything of the story. I don't know anything of the story. I could

46
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:44,600
look it up. Can you okay? Can you know I'm going to tell my story. You're never

47
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:47,320
going to see this movie. You're just interrupting a story for no reason. No,

48
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:51,720
no, no, I have a I have a suggestion. I want to see this movie very bad. Can you

49
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:55,760
Can you change that? What are you talking about? It looks really good. I

50
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:58,600
want to see it. I want to see it this week. I want to see it this week. So

51
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:02,160
can you do a movie in three years? Can you change the names,

52
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:07,600
change the name of the movie to a movie that I've seen? No, so that it's

53
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:10,900
not a spoiler and I think that this is a higher man.

54
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:15,600
Wow, okay, I've seen Iron Man. So in the scene in the movie, when Jeremy

55
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:18,080
Allen White kills himself, yes, near the end, yeah

56
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:24,180
everybody's everybody. I saw this at the night Hawk, which is a dine in a movie

57
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:27,260
theater where you get the food, you get a meal, a movie theater where you get

58
00:03:27,260 --> 00:03:30,100
the food, you get the food, they bring the food to you, which I don't like

59
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:33,280
very much. It's so fucking expensive. It's crazy. We only went because we had

60
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:37,220
a gift card. It's insane anyway. This scene, this is probably the scene in the

61
00:03:37,220 --> 00:03:39,500
movie. That's very sad. It's probably

62
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:43,820
my movie review, probably the scene in the movie. I'm doing a little movie

63
00:03:43,820 --> 00:03:47,900
review along, along with this, but he kills himself. He

64
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:52,060
he kills himself and I literally the entire theater. I can hear everybody

65
00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:55,360
around me. I can hear these people sniffling and cry. I can hear people

66
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:59,060
crying all around me like just genuinely crying. I hear baby type sniffles of

67
00:03:59,060 --> 00:04:02,740
like yes of crying. I see the guy sitting in front of me. He has his head

68
00:04:02,740 --> 00:04:06,680
in his hands. He's it's the saddest that I've ever seen a group of people in

69
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:10,060
public and I was thinking I was couldn't stop but smiling and chuckling

70
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:13,220
to myself because I could not think stop thinking about how funny it would be if

71
00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:16,600
right at that moment the waiters brought me out a gigantic triple decker

72
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:17,140
the

73
00:04:17,140 --> 00:04:24,180
it's one of the ones that explode

74
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:30,960
to pour the cheese on top

75
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:32,880
everyone

76
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:36,540
and it's somebody's

77
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:42,800
burger boy. Here's the birthday burger, burning Jesus going over my

78
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:49,440
special. They have a special for the birthday burger boy. It's

79
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:55,800
if it's your birthday, you get a triple decker hamburger that has came up. It

80
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:59,640
has a camembert cheese thing that explodes out. It made me really want to

81
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:03,300
pay attention to what point in the movie that happens and go back and try and

82
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:07,220
get that try and line that up. I get my or before that, so right when he's like

83
00:05:07,220 --> 00:05:09,740
when the brothers carrying him in his arms, they're like

84
00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:14,860
because the other thing about that theater is you can tell when somebody

85
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:17,920
there's food near you because you could smell it yeah. So they everyone be

86
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:20,140
crying and they would just start smelling it. Yeah, they're already

87
00:05:20,140 --> 00:05:23,420
sniffling. They're already sniffling. I look over you have a burger that

88
00:05:23,420 --> 00:05:23,760
this

89
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:27,780
you have a dagwood and you're going and I'm going oh yeah.

90
00:05:27,780 --> 00:05:29,300
Here we go.

91
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:33,420
I'm so hungry. I haven't eaten since lunch.

92
00:05:33,420 --> 00:05:38,400
I had an experience watching that sorry go ahead and finish your that's the end,

93
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:41,420
but I have a question for after you tell you experience. My experience was I went

94
00:05:41,460 --> 00:05:46,020
the regal the regal downtown the Essex and they have the reclining chairs and I

95
00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:49,700
would just like to say I'm somebody who goes into every movie theater and I

96
00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:53,920
think that there's going to be an attack every single time these chairs

97
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:58,460
obliterate this fear and here's why sleep. I'm too comfortable to get out of

98
00:05:58,460 --> 00:06:02,100
my chair, even if I was getting shot at a hundred percent every other movie

99
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:05,140
theater. I go into I think, oh, I could do a double back flip over that

100
00:06:05,140 --> 00:06:09,660
staircase and I could probably save hundreds of lives by disarming the

101
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:15,200
person this I ain't doing shit. No, if they walk in and I'm in a recliner and

102
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:19,920
I'm thanksgiving full off popcorn, I'm dead yeah. My whole yeah, just pretend

103
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:23,080
I was trying to I get the same fear and I was trying to comfort myself at the

104
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:26,720
night Hawk being like well, nobody this place is so he's gonna go to the movie.

105
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:29,420
Nobody's gonna theater. Nobody's gonna go there and try and kill everybody, but

106
00:06:29,420 --> 00:06:32,580
then I was saying like well, if you was your if you're about to kill everybody

107
00:06:32,580 --> 00:06:36,460
and either get put into prison for life or kill yourself right after, would you

108
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:39,480
would you not spend all the money you have left on nachos?

109
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:40,480
That's true.

110
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:45,480
Would you not spend $100 on a movie ticket and then $500 more on food before you go out

111
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:46,480
in a blaze of glory?

112
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:49,480
I went there with Brandon one time and we bought a whole bottle of wine.

113
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:50,480
It's a crazy place.

114
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:51,480
It shouldn't exist.

115
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:54,480
I see people around me ordering multiple rounds of snacks.

116
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:57,480
They're literally spending $75 during a movie.

117
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:58,480
It's unbelievable.

118
00:06:58,480 --> 00:06:59,480
It's morally wrong.

119
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:00,480
It's morally disgusting.

120
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:03,480
You think it's moral beer in a movie, but then you're spending $7 on a PBR.

121
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:04,480
It's insane.

122
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:05,480
I had a $16 Bud Light one.

123
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:09,980
sixteen dollar Bud Light when I saw it's crazy. It's so insane. That should be

124
00:07:09,980 --> 00:07:14,880
you should be shot if your business sells Bud Light for sixteen dollars.

125
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:18,480
Well, that's kind of what we're getting at anyway. Oh my God. Right. Yeah,

126
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:22,440
these are the most likely spots for an attack. We should not question name the

127
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:26,160
theater by name then, because then there could be some James Holmes style crazy

128
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:30,040
out there that listens to us and thinks that that's a coded message. Right. Some

129
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:32,920
kind of a fan of you who decided to listen to me and Caleb just because we

130
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:36,600
from proximity to you yeah, but mostly here for Patrick yeah, just a thing

131
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:40,960
I'm the I'm the magnet for those properties and probably will. I'm the

132
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:44,320
crazy magnet through the crazy and probably not the Joe Biden song guy.

133
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:47,440
Those people are all reasonable. The electricists yeah, those are

134
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:51,200
that's true right that even scared me okay, but let me get let me ask my

135
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:54,400
question. I guess is mostly a question for Caleb who's who come on,

136
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:58,040
which one of us is which brother I don't know the movie, so I don't know if

137
00:07:58,040 --> 00:08:01,680
it's because here's because here's what here's I have one that I want to throw

138
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:06,520
out there right away. Okay, Julio is the dad. Yeah, Julio is the dad. I agree

139
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:08,520
abusive, abusive,

140
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:13,840
trying to live vicariously through us. Exactly. He couldn't make it. He couldn't

141
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:17,320
make it. So, now he needs to see us make it. He needs to see us make it. Okay,

142
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:18,120
then which one is,

143
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:22,600
I guess, Pat is the biggest head? I think Pat is Jeremy Allen White. Oh,

144
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:26,560
that's sad. Well, I guess I kill myself. Okay, I was gonna say everybody kills

145
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:28,740
yourselves in this movie. I would say

146
00:08:28,740 --> 00:08:33,300
Pat is the little skinny one who gets brain damage. Oh, Pat is the one who

147
00:08:33,300 --> 00:08:37,860
just wants a career in music. Yeah, this is you. This is you just off of looks

148
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:41,100
the tall one yeah and then I'm a combination of the other two guys

149
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:44,780
basically. I think all the patches all the best a run. Also, I'm so stupid

150
00:08:44,780 --> 00:08:47,020
that I would shoot myself in the heart instead of the head. Yeah,

151
00:08:47,020 --> 00:08:51,860
that was so I was like that I was like wait. Well, you hear the gun shot to do

152
00:08:51,860 --> 00:08:55,300
make up. You hear the gun shot and you see the blood dripping as he carries the

153
00:08:55,340 --> 00:08:58,640
body and then he lays him down on table. Okay, I'm I'm rubbing my hands

154
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:02,980
together. Okay, I get to finally see this fucking loser from the bear, get

155
00:09:02,980 --> 00:09:07,740
his head exploded and then God damn it. He shot himself in the heart crazy

156
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:11,700
Elliot Smith, bullshit, the most dramatic way to kill it.

157
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:16,840
Now that's the dad is so far with a sniper shot. Yeah, dad shot him with a

158
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:19,880
sniper. That's what I need to see. That's my theory. I need to see this

159
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:23,200
movie now. Here's fine man. It's okay, but here was my problem with the movie.

160
00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:26,520
thing I told you guys this the end of the movie, I'm sure you agree is the end of

161
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:30,360
the movie is everything is has gone wrong in this guy's life. His entire

162
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:35,360
family, everyone he loves is dead and he has two sons and they're doing okay and

163
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:39,040
at the end he's he starts bawling crying, but then his son's cheer him up and

164
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:42,700
they play football. Could that not have just been him having like

165
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:48,360
a really nice time at a water park or he could have eaten an amazing one that

166
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:52,340
made me tear up. Why the why the fuck how does that it's still the saddest story

167
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:56,040
whatever this is not an uplifting. Why'd they even try yeah? I thought the part

168
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:59,680
where there's a fifth brother. There's another brother who killed himself to

169
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:03,680
they cut. He got cut as he's the saddest one where they're in the afterlife and

170
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:06,680
they and they see the one is a movie. Yeah, you know what I'm talking about.

171
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:11,040
Yeah, I was I could not they travel to the afterlife. Oh yeah, they die. Well,

172
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:14,840
no, like the movie they go to head. There's a scene of them in heaven, not

173
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:18,960
heaven, but it's the afterlife and it's not they go to hell. It's not real. It's

174
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,500
even a movie. It's a movie scene,

175
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:22,360
but they meet their

176
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:26,660
and all the it's all made adult brothers, but they meet their their oldest

177
00:10:26,660 --> 00:10:29,680
brother who died when he was a kid and he's still a little kid and there and

178
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:32,900
he's like you must be jack and they little kids is like yeah

179
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:39,280
the smiles. I don't want a little kid smile. It's so scary yeah yeah, no, I

180
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:42,800
just comically said to the point where I didn't even feel sad. I felt nothing.

181
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:45,860
I felt yeah. I mean nothing. The only thing that made me cry was when the guy

182
00:10:45,860 --> 00:10:48,280
when he was looking at his kids playing football and he was thinking about

183
00:10:48,340 --> 00:10:51,580
playing football with his brother. The only interesting are the the entire

184
00:10:51,580 --> 00:10:54,680
movie. It was okay. This brother starts playing.

185
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:59,340
What do they do wrestling and he dies okay? Oh, this other brother's going to

186
00:10:59,340 --> 00:11:02,220
start wrestling. Okay, well he'll probably kill himself badly multiple

187
00:11:02,220 --> 00:11:05,680
times in the movie. It was that every fucking brother, Zac Efron would say

188
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:08,860
something like well looks like everything's perfect right now and then

189
00:11:08,860 --> 00:11:10,300
would immediately cut to a brother.

190
00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:15,380
Yeah, the brothers, they did that with every death was just that from being

191
00:11:15,380 --> 00:11:17,900
like looks like things are finally looking up. I don't come to a phone

192
00:11:17,940 --> 00:11:21,540
public. Your brother is the and by the way they're going to have to remake this

193
00:11:21,540 --> 00:11:25,580
movie in twenty more years when the Zac Efron character also kills itself.

194
00:11:25,580 --> 00:11:28,880
Here's something crazy. He's survived for now. Did you know in real life the

195
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:33,060
Zac Efron characters two sons? They also became pro wrestlers. Oh, no, that's

196
00:11:33,060 --> 00:11:37,300
good. They're going to die to it's great. The whole family said pure death and

197
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:41,500
destruction. It's an actual curse. I'm convinced yeah, it's incredible. It made

198
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:44,300
me so wish that I had this kind of family

199
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:49,060
there's tons of brothers. I mean the thing is you don't have there's no you

200
00:11:49,060 --> 00:11:51,760
don't have to become an interesting person or be good at anything. If you

201
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:55,160
have five brothers, you die, you still get a movie made about yeah yeah, even

202
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:58,800
if the even if the end of the world champion exactly, it wasn't that good.

203
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:03,040
No, he was the worst of the brothers yeah exactly and he still got a move

204
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:05,980
because he didn't go hard enough that every other brother, which is so hard in

205
00:12:05,980 --> 00:12:09,660
their careers that they died. It's about if you're too big of a pussy, you see

206
00:12:09,660 --> 00:12:13,360
everyone around you die and then you just have to have a son and here's yeah

207
00:12:13,380 --> 00:12:16,640
here's your consolation. You have a beautiful family and not that beautiful

208
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:19,920
in real life. They really I'll say it guys. They really dolled up the family

209
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:23,760
for yeah for the movie. They dolled that's them dolled up yeah dude. Oh

210
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:28,460
Zac Efron, I said this to you guys. Also great actor looks insane, be in any

211
00:12:28,460 --> 00:12:31,960
other movie except this one. No completely he well he's a good he's

212
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:35,640
doing good, but you can't see any emotion on his face. It's crazy. He's

213
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:40,820
like yeah. He has no humanity. He has a full Easter Island head become and guys

214
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:41,700
I'm segwaying here.

215
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:42,200
Yeah.

216
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:42,700
A cyborg.

217
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:45,500
[HUMMING]

218
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:46,620
Technology.

219
00:12:46,620 --> 00:12:48,220
Julio, pull up that video.

220
00:12:48,220 --> 00:12:49,260
Technologic.

221
00:12:49,260 --> 00:12:50,940
Pull up that video, because that's the--

222
00:12:50,940 --> 00:12:52,500
That's a perfect song.

223
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:55,820
Technology we play.

224
00:12:55,820 --> 00:12:56,580
OK.

225
00:12:56,580 --> 00:12:57,300
Wait, what's this?

226
00:12:57,300 --> 00:12:58,860
This is the-- so it is technology we--

227
00:12:58,860 --> 00:13:01,340
This is a perfect segway song.

228
00:13:01,340 --> 00:13:04,180
Actually, would we get DMCA'd if we play this?

229
00:13:04,180 --> 00:13:04,680
Nah.

230
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:06,300
This is the guy singing Ayo Technology.

231
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:13,300
He's not really singing.

232
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:17,300
He's not really singing.

233
00:13:17,300 --> 00:13:19,300
Okay.

234
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:23,300
What does he say?

235
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:25,300
Technology.

236
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:29,300
He says technology at the chorus.

237
00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:33,300
It's in the chorus.

238
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:36,300
We should have come to the chorus. We can just cut it now.

239
00:13:36,300 --> 00:13:43,300
So this is, you know, traditionally on this show, we each make something.

240
00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:45,300
Yeah, a PowerPoint, write something, report.

241
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:47,300
This is what I did because...

242
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:49,300
Painting, YouTube search technology.

243
00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:52,300
I looked up AO technology. It's a good song.

244
00:13:52,300 --> 00:13:58,300
I mean, it is a good song, but also really nothing for audio people or video people really either.

245
00:13:58,300 --> 00:14:02,300
People who listen on the audio will get to, maybe they've never heard it before.

246
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:05,300
The song they've never heard a song before.

247
00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:08,300
He's never heard it. You never heard that song.

248
00:14:08,300 --> 00:14:11,300
What's who's it by 50 Cent Timbaland see 50 Cent Timbo.

249
00:14:11,300 --> 00:14:14,300
See now we're opening Cameron up to this.

250
00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:17,300
That's true. I mean I've been wanting to basically give him a hip hop education.

251
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:20,300
We've never I mean what is he listen to ABC by Jackson 5

252
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:23,300
Mark Kozilek ABC by Jackson 5

253
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:26,300
gotta be one of my favorite hip hop songs.

254
00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:29,300
It's that and Wu-Tang.

255
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:31,040
the bars are a little bad in that

256
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:37,320
the bars, the bars, the bars, I think the bars are rhyming lyrical. They're just

257
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:42,720
not like hard type bar. They go hard there. I think the bars are dummy be be

258
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:46,700
careful. You said, oh my God, I got him to say beak bird

259
00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:48,160
bird.

260
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:49,260
That was to

261
00:14:49,260 --> 00:14:55,300
spills. Earlier we had a fully more of an explode. We it wasn't. We had what we

262
00:14:55,340 --> 00:14:59,300
explosion. I could not believe it. We call this in sports an unforced error.

263
00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:06,100
I was walking and just dropped my coffee for no reason at all. Nobody even didn't

264
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:09,780
trip on anything, just was holding the coffee and then just decided to let go.

265
00:15:09,780 --> 00:15:13,780
You got hit with the limp ray. I think I do. I think that's my problem with

266
00:15:13,780 --> 00:15:17,380
spilling, is that I have bad wrist posture. You need to get one of those

267
00:15:17,380 --> 00:15:21,860
squeezers. No. Do this, do that workout. But then next time I'm choking my

268
00:15:22,420 --> 00:15:28,020
shaking. I pull the thing. Oh, don't bring that it a little bit, but not

269
00:15:28,020 --> 00:15:31,380
you don't have to squeeze it all the way. That's what I mean. I'm squeezing

270
00:15:31,380 --> 00:15:34,020
it as hard as I can. I think once you get he's trying to make a play,

271
00:15:34,020 --> 00:15:37,700
don't be able to not squeeze. Well, yeah, because I won't know my own

272
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:40,780
strength. Yeah, he's trying to make play snakes with his dong. Yeah, it

273
00:15:40,780 --> 00:15:43,460
sounds like you're squeezing too hard in general. This you're supposed to

274
00:15:43,460 --> 00:15:45,920
squeeze. I don't need to squeeze enough that you're worried that you don't

275
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:49,420
use. You don't have to squeeze to make it feel like a you don't need to

276
00:15:49,460 --> 00:15:53,560
squeeze. You don't need to squeeze like I mean you know what squeeze what hand

277
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:58,160
make it feel like a woman's hand, a squeezer, a woman's squeeze, a squeezer.

278
00:15:58,160 --> 00:15:58,920
It squeezes you

279
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:02,860
yeah. It's supposed to be a full squeeze experience. You don't need to squeeze

280
00:16:02,860 --> 00:16:06,240
that much. You maybe need to squeeze a little depend. I guess if you know,

281
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:11,040
maybe your hand is bigger than or you could just be a freak of really, as I

282
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:14,440
am like I don't like that thing. I don't even curl my hand at all. You rub the

283
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:18,920
sides yeah. I get up there like I'm like well. I go around. I like this. I rub

284
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:22,460
horizontally. This is what I'm doing. Imagine this is my thing. You hit the top

285
00:16:22,460 --> 00:16:25,900
of it? Uh-huh. Like kind of a cat batting at a fish's rod.

286
00:16:25,900 --> 00:16:31,880
Ding! Yes. That's what I should be doing. Have you ever done that? I do this.

287
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:36,380
Where you have an erect, hard penis and the tip of it, for some reason, it hits

288
00:16:36,380 --> 00:16:39,720
something and it feels like it gets pushed and maybe you lose an inch.

289
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:42,820
Speaking of getting hit, my girlfriend has-,

290
00:16:42,820 --> 00:16:47,020
Whoa, whoa, chill, bro! No, no, no. My girlfriend has a black eye. Speaking of

291
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:52,160
getting hit my girlfriend has this thing on the toilet like what are the

292
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:55,360
cottony thing? It looks like looks like it matches the

293
00:16:55,360 --> 00:17:00,880
what is the word is it doily is that the word for what? Wait it's doily on

294
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:03,600
the toilet. Do you have one of those things on the toilet seat? The fuzzy

295
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:07,040
toilet seat covers? That makes you, it gets nasty shit on it. It doesn't get

296
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:10,240
nasty shit does it? It does man. It's on the inside seat or the lid of the

297
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:13,640
seat? The lid. Oh okay. But the carpeted toilet seat is one of the most

298
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:19,080
psychotic. You never seen that? No. My mom's old boss had one in her house and

299
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:23,100
she had a water bed. Oh, nice lady's a freak. Yeah, she definitely... Water...

300
00:17:23,100 --> 00:17:26,360
She wanted to fuck on the toilet. She wanted to get fucked on the toilet. Water

301
00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:33,400
bed in her guest bedroom. Whoa, that is a swinger kind of thing. But the...

302
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:39,280
So she's got the doily on the lid, but now because of that,

303
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:46,560
the toilet doesn't stay like the lid will sometimes or the lid where you sit will

304
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:53,520
fall down and it I like near like Indiana Jones missed, I had to like dodge

305
00:17:53,520 --> 00:18:00,360
it. I know it almost hit the tip of my dick so hard. I almost got it by my

306
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:04,920
toilet. I know the situation of trying to pee on a toilet seat that is about to

307
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:08,320
fall down. That's a scary, scary situation. You have to hold your, you

308
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:12,560
to shoot all your P back into yourself and because some public bathrooms are in

309
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:16,280
some houses where it's all women and they don't know about seats going up.

310
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:20,440
They don't understand that the seat has to stay up yeah yeah and it's just and

311
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:24,600
they can fall down and it's horrifying and I've tried to explain this to her. I

312
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:28,160
tried to explain this to her and she said no, I'm not getting rid of this

313
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:32,280
toilet seat doily. Why so you can sit on the top of this of the toilet. This is

314
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:33,920
where the hitting comes into play.

315
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:39,560
that you were talking about. She said, No, you I don't want to get the

316
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:42,760
hitting is on my penis. But if if we were to battle,

317
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:46,960
if you were to battle your girlfriend, you think you'd win if we were to

318
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:51,160
buddy, I'm getting gigantic and that's the other. That's the main thing I've

319
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:54,460
taken away from the Iron Claw movie is I've been doing the Iron Claw on my

320
00:18:54,460 --> 00:18:57,760
fiance a lot. Yes, the Iron Claw. It's where you go like this.

321
00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:01,760
And then she goes, Oh, no. And then you go like this. You hold her head.

322
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:05,640
grab a grab and it doesn't work so well. No, it doesn't make you bleed like it

323
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:09,400
doesn't the move. She asked you to do the dishes. You go to it's really funny

324
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:14,200
to just suddenly go like this and it just does nothing. No, she just that was

325
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:17,800
their move was yes, it's awesome and in real life you'd say what are you doing

326
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:19,440
man yeah, but in this they go

327
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:25,520
and he almost kills a player with it. He makes Rick Flair believe because he

328
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:29,780
iron claws. He does a real iron claw, not a wrestling iron. No, he does a real

329
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:34,100
going on Rick Flair's head. Yeah, I gotta see this movie. It's a great movie man,

330
00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:35,560
and we saw in digital

331
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:43,560
technology, technology, I have something to show my two friends and my employee

332
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:47,460
and my employee will pull it up right now. Let me see this

333
00:19:47,460 --> 00:19:52,820
any minute and he's passed on. He's yeah, what is going on? He is in living

334
00:19:52,820 --> 00:19:57,620
in Dios de los. I think he ran away. He must have heard one second. He needs one

335
00:19:57,620 --> 00:20:00,620
second. It's a sec. That's okay. I will stall with other technology. Hey,

336
00:20:00,620 --> 00:20:05,080
another technology thing. I got my phone screen replaced. Oh yeah. What happened

337
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:06,360
your phone, your phone again?

338
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:12,600
I am the spiller and the dropper. It's great. Every phone, I spill every

339
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:17,880
drink. It's unbelievable. My desk, I got my wife, got me a white mouse pad.

340
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:20,620
Yeah, okay.

341
00:20:20,620 --> 00:20:22,800
All right, so here's what we have here.

342
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:28,240
So I was thinking okay, what's the what is up with technology right go full

343
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:31,400
screen on this it's right on the top right of the thing.

344
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:34,080
No, no right on the top right of the

345
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:38,800
of the square yeah, so okay before you touch anything so

346
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:46,280
I was thinking about I was thinking about technology and I was thinking

347
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:49,640
about what we do podcast right now, I was like okay, we've already made a

348
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:55,080
technological leap from audio only well. First of all, a big leap was was

349
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:56,260
starting the podcast. I was a

350
00:20:56,260 --> 00:20:59,560
technological from from just talking to now in

351
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:05,820
equation using microphone, but then equations I was then we did another to

352
00:21:05,820 --> 00:21:09,880
another level and we started doing video. This is a brand new technology. We

353
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:13,720
be something in ten years from now. What is podcast about list going to look

354
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:16,440
like? I think it's going to look a little something like this. This is an

355
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:20,400
interactive podcast wow so you can go ahead and press the green button

356
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:24,400
scratch. You can see I made this on scratch, which is MIT Massachusetts

357
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:30,320
might do the what technology, so we have over here. We have Cameron, Patrick and

358
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:35,520
Caleb and guys yes, no, how Sam yes, that's me guess how these were made

359
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:35,880
guys

360
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:37,680
how

361
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:43,040
artificial intelligence, go ahead and

362
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:47,080
Make sure there's audio from this. Could you click on Cameron, please?

363
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:53,560
Okay, he says greetings rapidly evolving technological landscape. Innovation

364
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:57,960
continues to redefine our daily lives, bridging the gap between possibility and

365
00:21:57,960 --> 00:22:03,440
reality. Wow, that's something you'll be able to. So now click me, you'll be

366
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:08,160
able to click on us and have as we navigate the dynamic currents of the

367
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:11,440
tech realm, transformative breakthroughs and interconnected advancements shape

368
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:13,320
the very fabric of our digital future.

369
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:14,820
Wow,

370
00:22:14,820 --> 00:22:18,760
this is an incredible, incredible podcast. That's what I'm saying to

371
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:22,840
click on Patrick, so it's like we're. This is what it'll be like in years

372
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:23,280
from now.

373
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:38,160
So it's like a podcast that is you click on the you instead of just

374
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:41,120
listening to people say stuff, waiting for the year. When is the next guy

375
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:45,160
going to talk. I heard Cameron say it's like when is Caleb going to talk at

376
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:49,500
your own head into your fingertips at your own place, a fully simulated

377
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:53,840
podcast, and this is all done using current technology. So in ten years,

378
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:58,360
wow, it'll probably be three dimensional. What is that behind it? Well, we're in

379
00:22:58,360 --> 00:23:02,700
Brooklyn, so this is Brooklyn style graffiti. Okay, that is

380
00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:04,800
culturally amazing,

381
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:09,640
multicultural, multicultural style. So what did you think that's incredible?

382
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:17,440
I'm just glad I don't you guys haven't used my voice for the AI. That was not a

383
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:22,920
those were things. You said already yeah, meet me and Cameron. This is

384
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:26,160
coming to me and he was like he was like can you can you quick? Can you quickly

385
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:29,720
record some serious thoughts on technology? I was like yeah, but yeah,

386
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:34,560
and they were really, I think, insightful and illuminating yeah, very

387
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:36,040
illuminating very

388
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:43,080
you I it's just it. I can't get over it. How much I look like Sam. It's age ten

389
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:46,800
years. So I'm going to look like binging with Babish Cameron looks very much the

390
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:48,240
same and you

391
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:52,200
I'll have a pair in ten years. That's good.

392
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:57,040
That's actually thank you for giving me hair in ten years. Well, we'll have

393
00:23:57,040 --> 00:23:59,720
because that's not going to happen. That's not going to be there. You'll be

394
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:04,000
on him. That's also why you got shorter was the him. Yeah, him does make you

395
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:08,240
much shorter. If you tay, if you're a man and you take him's buddy, you're in for

396
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:10,520
a rude away. You're a you're a she the

397
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:15,400
the hymns that you're going to go him's hers. They actually have her. They have

398
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:19,920
her and guess what hers is a burly anxiety medication and anxiety. Yeah,

399
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:23,560
yeah, the him that you're going to be. If you take him's is mugsy bogues,

400
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:27,040
you're going to be real small. You're gonna be singing him's at your funeral

401
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:30,880
because that stuff kills you as an angel. Yeah, as an as a be alive at your

402
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:33,940
funeral. Now that would make much sense. It wouldn't make any sense at all.

403
00:24:33,940 --> 00:24:37,540
Now make any sense. Well, thank you for showing that that piece of technology

404
00:24:37,540 --> 00:24:40,700
to us. Caleb, that's really wonderful. Anytime man. I mean, I let me and let

405
00:24:40,700 --> 00:24:44,820
me say one other thing about technology. Yeah, guys, I really like using scratch.

406
00:24:44,820 --> 00:24:49,060
Scratch is fun. I used to be a scratch wizard. Me too. I made a lot of I made

407
00:24:49,060 --> 00:24:53,020
a lot of pong games in there. I taught a class on scratch. Really? Yeah. Would

408
00:24:53,020 --> 00:24:56,420
you teach us one right now? Could you tell us some things about school? Julio,

409
00:24:56,420 --> 00:25:00,220
how about you open up scratch and Cameron? I don't think so. It's gonna be

410
00:25:00,260 --> 00:25:04,220
bad. That would be bad. That'd be really bad. It's a bad idea. Yeah, I'm just so

411
00:25:04,220 --> 00:25:07,420
technologically illiterate that I just go around and say some of our favorite

412
00:25:07,420 --> 00:25:10,900
pieces of technology. What's yours? Probably the Blackberry Blackberry is

413
00:25:10,900 --> 00:25:14,780
the Blackberry that I own, and I'm going to say Bluetooth technology is really up

414
00:25:14,780 --> 00:25:17,980
there for me. I'm speaking of Bluetooth. It's a video game controller for me. The

415
00:25:17,980 --> 00:25:21,220
video game controllers have gotten and you know what I'll say mine,

416
00:25:21,220 --> 00:25:26,020
the rumble pack. I like the rumble pack as well as the joystick. I like the

417
00:25:26,020 --> 00:25:29,380
ergonomic feel. You've got joystick or rumble pack. Oh, definitely rumble pack

418
00:25:29,460 --> 00:25:34,540
really really come on. Yes, imagine you're in a mine cart and it makes it

419
00:25:34,540 --> 00:25:37,460
and you get to feel that

420
00:25:37,460 --> 00:25:41,500
is actually it's actually makes it immersive. Oh, I thought of another

421
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:45,900
technology just now three D, three D, and I'm not talking about three D glasses.

422
00:25:45,900 --> 00:25:50,540
I'm talking about three D itself, three D. It's just three D or the electrical

423
00:25:50,540 --> 00:25:55,660
wire. Oh, and I oh silicone silicone is huge. Silicone is huge in technology. Oh

424
00:25:55,780 --> 00:26:00,420
self lubricating joints and pistons. Oh, you know, I saw a great technology

425
00:26:00,420 --> 00:26:06,340
video. I saw a great technology video earlier, a cobalt mine in a foreign

426
00:26:06,340 --> 00:26:09,900
country, people jumping over each other and it looks like World War. See people

427
00:26:09,900 --> 00:26:14,380
don't think about the human technology people who act like robots just to

428
00:26:14,380 --> 00:26:18,300
satisfy others exactly. So who are these people? These are fast food workers.

429
00:26:18,300 --> 00:26:24,660
Yes, these are our politicians, arguably yeah, sexual nympho maniacs, sexual

430
00:26:24,700 --> 00:26:28,640
people who give their bodies away freely almost like a three D avatar circus

431
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:32,940
exactly circus performance. People people who the trapeze one of my favorite

432
00:26:32,940 --> 00:26:37,500
pieces of technology. Once the trapeze was invented, I felt like we had nowhere

433
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:40,820
to go but down yeah and by the way, but the trapeze artist had nowhere to go,

434
00:26:40,820 --> 00:26:44,500
but speaking of you let go that trapeze are going down, not if you jump well

435
00:26:44,500 --> 00:26:46,540
speaking of cirques, I call them cirques.

436
00:26:46,540 --> 00:26:52,660
Guess what I saw since the last time we spoke last the circus. Cirque du Soleil

437
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:56,280
the night before Christmas Cirque du Soleil and guys before Christmas. Yes,

438
00:26:56,280 --> 00:27:00,440
and guys, I wish it was circuit. You guys, you buy this ticket. Okay, it's

439
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:04,140
sixty dollars. You go to Madison Square Garden. You sit in line for one hour.

440
00:27:04,140 --> 00:27:10,280
You're seated right. You're seated lights down. The show begins. It's for

441
00:27:10,280 --> 00:27:10,920
children.

442
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:15,640
It is a children version of Cirque du Soleil. Nobody in the room knew this.

443
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:20,160
There was no kids there. Wow. It was fully a kids show. All of the

444
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:25,560
performers were kids. None of them were licensed to hang upside down, so they

445
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:29,160
didn't. They ran around, they hula hooped, and they dressed up like elves.

446
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:32,680
Were there people at your schools that went to circus camp? No. To learn to be

447
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:36,000
circus performers? Fuck no. That was kind of a common thing at my school. What?

448
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:39,920
There was multiple people who went to- Like Barnum and Bailey? It was called

449
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:40,880
Circus Smurkus,

450
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:45,600
and they learned to juggle and do acrobatics. I'm not kidding. Jesus Christ.

451
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:50,040
Multiple people, that was like a thing that they did. That's crazy. I kind of

452
00:27:50,040 --> 00:27:54,760
I didn't know if that was a type of kid. No, that's not a type. I don't think that's that's local to

453
00:27:54,760 --> 00:27:59,480
your town. It should be, though. Isn't that funny? That is funny kids at your school. The

454
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:04,680
circus. Click. Yeah, the circus kids. They were I don't even think they were like they weren't

455
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:08,120
like friends with each other. And they were they just happened to be. I think it was like a

456
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:13,480
summer going in the hallway where they run away circus style. No, no, this is my no. And these

457
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:19,480
are these are people who mostly grew into hikers and normal well adjusted people. Okay, I don't

458
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:23,220
I don't think anybody went into the circus, the circus field. Well, it's

459
00:28:23,220 --> 00:28:25,720
just so they could juggle to like impress a little and while there was a

460
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:28,920
juggling and also like I guess walking on your hands type style. I think it

461
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:31,340
was multiple stuff. I mean, I don't know. I know this is all this is all

462
00:28:31,340 --> 00:28:34,560
stuff that you learn so that you can like have ice breakers so that you can

463
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:37,680
make friends with people right. This is something that you can't for children

464
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:41,860
that aren't good at making friends yeah, but the thing is here's the weird part

465
00:28:41,860 --> 00:28:44,540
of that because it's also it sounds like it would be that, but I think these

466
00:28:44,540 --> 00:28:47,580
people all had a fine time making friends, but in order to do it, I think

467
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:51,160
have to be pretty. You have to be pretty strong. You have to be kind of an athlete. You know

468
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:53,520
what I mean to like walk on your hands and shit like that. So it's not like you would

469
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:57,840
expect it to be like, you know, scrawny nerdy kids or weirdos who during circus camp, but

470
00:28:57,840 --> 00:29:02,800
it's kind of like, you know, the guys who are strong and jocks jocks. There's strong

471
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:07,720
nerds. Yeah, I guess so, but I don't think they have secret strength. Super. Yeah, they

472
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:13,480
always love metal mind. What I always love metal guitar like every strong nerd in high

473
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:17,160
school is also like, hey, he's also like he's got a seven string guitar that he learned.

474
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:19,960
I don't think there were any strong words at my high school. I'm going to be real.

475
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:24,360
There's a lot of my only very weak, a strong nerd. I feel like as as come into

476
00:29:24,360 --> 00:29:27,720
with with Instagram weightlifting, I think a strong nerd is really coming to

477
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:32,040
vote. Yeah, there was a sleeper build. Yes, there's a lot of those guys at my

478
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:34,800
school and they were all in this thing technology.

479
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:36,360
There was a

480
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:42,360
program at my school called the PVC pirates, where they would learn how to

481
00:29:42,360 --> 00:29:42,680
make

482
00:29:44,120 --> 00:29:47,600
because it was a okay, different kind of technologies. It was like kids who were

483
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:51,640
like good at like like Lego robotics and stuff like that, but they were going

484
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:56,120
to the PBC. I never I remember to do you want to ruin Legos by putting

485
00:29:56,120 --> 00:29:59,280
technology in it yeah that stuff. I agree. I always thought that people

486
00:29:59,280 --> 00:30:03,860
like an analog yeah and here's a technology kind of credential. I have I

487
00:30:03,860 --> 00:30:06,280
was I don't know if you guys know this. I was the president of the computer

488
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:10,800
science club at my really and I just I destroyed the club. It stopped existing

489
00:30:10,840 --> 00:30:16,760
after I became president. I just did not do anything. We started the club, me and

490
00:30:16,760 --> 00:30:20,620
my friends. Well, the club existed, the former president passed it down to me

491
00:30:20,620 --> 00:30:24,440
and my friends. We held a we had a booth at the org fair for everyone to sign up

492
00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:27,960
for the club, and we met one time and we never met again. Well, it sounds like

493
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:30,880
you did an amazing job to the ground. Sounds like you did exactly what you're

494
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:32,920
supposed to do as president. Yeah, yeah,

495
00:30:32,920 --> 00:30:37,640
nothing yeah. We kind of got the assignment. If you know what I mean, yes,

496
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:41,520
you got it understood it. No, you got it got it yeah and you pass with flying

497
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:42,480
color with flying

498
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:50,880
RGB colors, see oh yes, composite yes, composite colors yeah, don't isn't it

499
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:54,480
doesn't it scare you when on Photoshop it says or do you want to switch this

500
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:58,320
document to a different color space? I said color space, you know what the hell

501
00:30:58,320 --> 00:31:02,920
is that I think I'm fine where I am yeah, no be I think I know I know why

502
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:07,120
there's different color spaces. Why is that for different technologies? There's

503
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:11,700
RGB for the computer, but then there's CMYK for printing printing kill your

504
00:31:11,700 --> 00:31:13,900
mother fucking kelf kill your kelf

505
00:31:13,900 --> 00:31:20,540
that doesn't that's knife in the right order. I'm real kill CMYK kill mother

506
00:31:20,540 --> 00:31:24,780
your kelf crazy mother fucking yellow colors

507
00:31:24,780 --> 00:31:29,280
or something like that.

508
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:34,180
Here's a technology that why is K black in that situation? Here's a why is that

509
00:31:34,180 --> 00:31:36,520
CMYB because B sounds like blue?

510
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:39,720
Oh, or be is taken by blue

511
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:44,380
the electric toothbrush.

512
00:31:44,380 --> 00:31:47,780
Do you guys have one of these? I just had to throw mine away because the

513
00:31:47,780 --> 00:31:52,060
motor died. This is a technology I don't support. Why I can you got to do your

514
00:31:52,060 --> 00:31:52,500
own work?

515
00:31:52,500 --> 00:31:57,500
Interesting technology is making us lazy. It's making us whatever you remember

516
00:31:57,500 --> 00:31:59,900
back in the day before we had electronic toothbrushes. You'd put the

517
00:31:59,900 --> 00:32:00,980
toothbrush in your mouth and go

518
00:32:00,980 --> 00:32:03,180
really, really fast.

519
00:32:04,220 --> 00:32:07,420
you have to go fast. That noise completely, perfectly, that's what somebody

520
00:32:07,420 --> 00:32:10,620
has been on an electric toothbrush for years. They probably get a normal

521
00:32:10,620 --> 00:32:12,900
toothbrush, they put it in their mouth, they don't move at all and they just

522
00:32:12,900 --> 00:32:13,360
hum like

523
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:17,420
I think that's what makes it go. They think that's a toothbrush. Speaking of

524
00:32:17,420 --> 00:32:22,220
toothbrushes and teeth, I got my wisdom tooth out technology technique for using

525
00:32:22,220 --> 00:32:26,460
technology and they gave me this technology that was amazing called codeine

526
00:32:26,460 --> 00:32:31,780
pills. Okay, and I would take these and I would watch what's his name on twitch

527
00:32:32,740 --> 00:32:35,040
excuse see I would watch him play

528
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:40,640
five GTA five role play. That's the craziest I've ever felt in my entire

529
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:43,780
life. I just remembered something Caleb. You died in my dream the other night.

530
00:32:43,780 --> 00:32:44,220
What

531
00:32:44,220 --> 00:32:49,720
a big piece of debris hit you in the head and you died. They should make

532
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:52,760
technology where I can go into your dream and stop that. That's a bad omen,

533
00:32:52,760 --> 00:32:56,360
because there's that big puddle. I had a dream over there. I had a dream that

534
00:32:56,360 --> 00:33:00,300
New York City was being was being nuclear bombed and there's explosions

535
00:33:00,340 --> 00:33:03,440
happening and I was I was hugging my fiancee. I think I love you so much. Oh

536
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:06,600
my God, I can't believe it's happening. I always love you. I'm so sorry it's

537
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:09,400
ending. This world is ending like this and I look over and kill against the

538
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:13,840
hitting the head with a rock. Was I in the dream or was I implied to be dead

539
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:17,680
for years? Caleb was in the dream getting killed for one. I had an at least

540
00:33:17,680 --> 00:33:21,240
I wasn't killed. I had a dream where I was a very bad guy in here. So you can

541
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:26,640
tell okay number one. I was involved in serial killing, okay, which is not that

542
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:30,240
big of a deal. The only dream I've ever had like this yes, but number two

543
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:34,680
get my partner in crime, Ellen DeGeneres.

544
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:35,680
Wow.

545
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:37,600
You and Ellen were so good.

546
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:41,840
I would bait people into this room and then she would murder them with a chainsaw.

547
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:42,840
That's crazy.

548
00:33:42,840 --> 00:33:43,840
And that was my dream.

549
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:44,840
Isn't that a crazy dream?

550
00:33:44,840 --> 00:33:49,960
I did have a crazy, not crazy dream, but last night I had a dream and it was, you guys were

551
00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:50,960
both there.

552
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:51,960
Whoa.

553
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:55,680
And it was me remembering the time that we went to New York City for the first time.

554
00:33:55,680 --> 00:33:56,680
We were at that Burger King.

555
00:33:56,680 --> 00:33:57,680
I remember that.

556
00:33:57,680 --> 00:34:03,720
weird thing in my dream. It was basically the exact same, exactly how we all remember it,

557
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:08,680
but I went up to buy onion rings at the Burger King on that bus. You know, the bus would

558
00:34:08,680 --> 00:34:12,680
stop at the Burger King. I went there and I just wanted to get onion rings and zesty

559
00:34:12,680 --> 00:34:17,680
sauce and the guy said, "One large onion ring, that'll be $18."

560
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:20,000
This is such a funny dream.

561
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:26,040
I said to him, "What the hell? $18 for onion rings? How big is the thing?" And he shows

562
00:34:26,040 --> 00:34:29,400
scares me. The size of the thing is like that big and I was like, oh, I'll just

563
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:32,480
get the medium. Then he said, oh, then that'll be eight dollars. I said, it's

564
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:33,880
eight dollars for

565
00:34:33,880 --> 00:34:35,000
this is

566
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:42,120
oh my God, inception. It's about dreams, but all Christopher Nolan could think

567
00:34:42,120 --> 00:34:43,600
about was a building spinning around

568
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:46,920
how expensive

569
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:53,000
me arguing with the guy behind the counter about the price of onion rings.

570
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:56,240
like why does that make any sense? Why is the large eighteen dollars in the

571
00:34:56,240 --> 00:34:58,860
medium is eight and then I bring you guys came over

572
00:34:58,860 --> 00:34:59,680
I would

573
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:05,000
I have to tell you something, Pat, you know, also my dream. I Lena Dunham,

574
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:12,120
I would rather be a die a von Eric style brother suicide death where I lose

575
00:35:12,120 --> 00:35:16,000
all my limbs and then I kill myself, then be your therapist.

576
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:19,960
Yeah, every day you coming in and being like I had the murder.

577
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:25,900
dream again. What does it mean this time? I would just be like,

578
00:35:25,900 --> 00:35:29,680
"Yeah, you got..." No, I know exactly what that means. I know exactly what

579
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:32,560
that means is that... 365, Klonopin, come back next year. Is that I would

580
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:35,880
do anything for onion rings, is all that dream means. I can kind of

581
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:39,040
figure out what my nuclear bomb dream means, except for the part where I

582
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:40,900
look over and see you get hit in the head with a piece of

583
00:35:40,900 --> 00:35:42,880
a building. That's just to make it feel real in your own head.

584
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:45,860
You're making it feel real in your head. That's immersion, yeah.

585
00:35:45,860 --> 00:35:50,040
It's just to make it sad, your friend dying. I cannot figure out my...

586
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:55,680
I need a Solomon style dream interpretation to figure out my Ellen

587
00:35:55,680 --> 00:35:58,740
degenerous dream. Not sure what that means yeah that ones are. I think I know

588
00:35:58,740 --> 00:36:02,680
what it means. That means that maybe I join the Hollywood cabal of evil people

589
00:36:02,680 --> 00:36:06,080
like Ellen to general and a generous may have been projecting into your dream to

590
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:10,280
make you do bad things. That is honestly the most that's the most log every night

591
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:13,400
you go. She's like the Occam's razor. That's a me. Yeah, I think that actually

592
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:16,680
is. Why else would you believe that in your side? Even a woman? I think about

593
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:20,880
that often. Oh yeah, why not Ellen degenerate? You don't think about her

594
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:24,280
out, because she's a dog. She's fallen by the wayside. She's zealous. I just

595
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:27,320
tell a lot of people riding skateboards, holding hands together. Well, their arms

596
00:36:27,320 --> 00:36:30,540
interlock. That's like the two opposite crazy. What happened? They were two

597
00:36:30,540 --> 00:36:34,080
people skateboarding side by side and their arms were locked like this. What is

598
00:36:34,080 --> 00:36:37,400
going? Am I in a dream right now? What the hell is happening? The conversation

599
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:41,200
is happening in real conversation just turned so crazy fast. Anyway, technology

600
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:46,000
car technology car. Tesla has a big screen on it. You play Mario sixty four

601
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:50,440
What's another technology we can want to talk about? I got a new technology. I

602
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:53,240
got an Xbox. I heard about this. Yeah, and this is this is guys.

603
00:36:53,240 --> 00:36:59,200
This is an amazing move that you can play on your cohabitator.

604
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:01,360
You

605
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:08,400
leave on the Amazon fire stick all day and night for years. It breaks. She says,

606
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:10,880
well, let's order another one. It's forty dollars. You say, yeah, it's forty

607
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:13,720
dollars, but for two hundred more dollars, we can get an Xbox. Yeah,

608
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:18,340
genius and you really mumble that you say for two hundred dollars, we get an

609
00:37:18,340 --> 00:37:22,200
xbox and then she goes yeah sure whatever it comes. She hates using the

610
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:27,080
controller guys. Of course it's not as good as a remote no, but it's a remote

611
00:37:27,080 --> 00:37:31,080
for an xbox. You probably can't they have sure you can yeah, so just tell her

612
00:37:31,080 --> 00:37:34,800
to buy that yeah just buy that it's a rare thing. It's almost certainly

613
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:38,160
ninety dollars. Just if you have a problem find out the solution and buy it

614
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:41,520
uh-huh. It's that simple girl. It's simply simple. It's that fucking simple

615
00:37:41,540 --> 00:37:47,100
Speaking of technology and game consoles, Noah informed me that the modded Wii that I have

616
00:37:47,100 --> 00:37:51,700
has died. Which is a very, very sad thing because we used to play so much.

617
00:37:51,700 --> 00:37:52,900
We would play so much.

618
00:37:52,900 --> 00:37:53,900
Planned obsolescence.

619
00:37:53,900 --> 00:37:56,180
Yeah. How many games would we play on that?

620
00:37:56,180 --> 00:37:57,180
Frolf.

621
00:37:57,180 --> 00:37:59,580
Frolf? Oh my God, we had so many Frolf sessions on that.

622
00:37:59,580 --> 00:38:01,540
That was the only game I ever played on that I think was Frolf.

623
00:38:01,540 --> 00:38:06,060
I got to figure out how to bring this Wii back to life because that had probably 150

624
00:38:06,060 --> 00:38:07,060
games.

625
00:38:07,060 --> 00:38:08,060
Can you mod a Wii?

626
00:38:08,060 --> 00:38:09,060
Yeah.

627
00:38:09,060 --> 00:38:11,060
Okay, I'll get you a Wii. I think we might have one.

628
00:38:11,060 --> 00:38:16,340
like yeah, maybe it might be in Boston. There is there's a thing. This is a

629
00:38:16,340 --> 00:38:22,580
technology. This is a technology fact. Okay, you find out your wheeze IP

630
00:38:22,580 --> 00:38:27,620
address. You go to this website, hack M I I dot com me. Hack me. I don't want

631
00:38:27,620 --> 00:38:32,660
to get and then you send some you send a file over to the through the IP

632
00:38:32,660 --> 00:38:37,300
address and then it opens up the little mail thing and then the they programmed

633
00:38:37,300 --> 00:38:40,340
it so that the little letter, you know, remember the letters at the bottom of

634
00:38:40,340 --> 00:38:44,180
the screen in the corner of the we know you open that up and there's a letter

635
00:38:44,180 --> 00:38:48,180
that has a bomb on it and then all the whole shit gets it installs this thing

636
00:38:48,180 --> 00:38:51,660
called the the home room in you and boot. I

637
00:38:51,660 --> 00:38:57,700
I can put being tired as many games. You want me I made my new avendor not xbox

638
00:38:57,700 --> 00:39:02,260
and I made it so realistic that the dog started going crazy barking the TV.

639
00:39:02,260 --> 00:39:06,420
He's never done this before barking the TV bearing his teeth hackles up

640
00:39:06,420 --> 00:39:10,020
and I had to put him in his crate and never show him the avatar again. Why

641
00:39:10,060 --> 00:39:11,660
Why don't you just make the avatar different?

642
00:39:11,660 --> 00:39:12,500
Why don't you make the avatar a dog?

643
00:39:12,500 --> 00:39:13,340
- Or is it just so photorealistic,

644
00:39:13,340 --> 00:39:15,220
just it looks like a person?

645
00:39:15,220 --> 00:39:17,460
- Do you have a Kinect that you took a photo of yourself?

646
00:39:17,460 --> 00:39:19,540
- Do I have a Kinect?

647
00:39:19,540 --> 00:39:21,540
Oh man, you should get a Kinect.

648
00:39:21,540 --> 00:39:23,100
- You know what you can do with the Kinect?

649
00:39:23,100 --> 00:39:26,100
You can use the Kinect to take photos

650
00:39:26,100 --> 00:39:27,900
and 3D model something.

651
00:39:27,900 --> 00:39:29,500
This is what my sister's ex used to do.

652
00:39:29,500 --> 00:39:32,020
He would model, he learned 3D modeling

653
00:39:32,020 --> 00:39:33,500
and he would take a Kinect and say,

654
00:39:33,500 --> 00:39:36,900
he would just move it around like that on an object

655
00:39:36,900 --> 00:39:38,420
and then he would have the object in the computer

656
00:39:38,420 --> 00:39:40,040
but he didn't know what to do with it.

657
00:39:40,040 --> 00:39:45,000
That sounds cool. Like I'd like to do that. We could do that. We could also play Just Dance.

658
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:50,580
We could also do that with technology. That's a classic piece of technology. That kept the

659
00:39:50,580 --> 00:39:56,560
Wii alive until 2020, I think. 2019 was the last game ported to the Wii and it was Just

660
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:59,660
Dance. Here's a funny Just Dance thing. You know when you're playing Just Dance with your

661
00:39:59,660 --> 00:40:03,280
parents and they don't understand that it only is tracking the remote? Yes. They're

662
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:06,520
shaking their remote. It's very funny. Yeah, your dads are snicking. I've never seen it.

663
00:40:06,520 --> 00:40:10,360
That's not a game in my house working in your face. It's so funny. They all

664
00:40:10,360 --> 00:40:13,420
they they're jumping. Why are you jumping? You don't have to drop. You're

665
00:40:13,420 --> 00:40:17,920
gonna hurt yourself. You don't have to do all the things the purple girl. You

666
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:21,560
can do some of it for style, but when you get into things like jumping, yeah,

667
00:40:21,560 --> 00:40:24,640
don't jump. You don't need to jump. That's like a lot of people don't realize

668
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:30,160
dance dance revolution. It's all just feet. It's just feet. Stop. We hold the

669
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:33,240
higher hands behind your back. Yeah, you'll do better. You will actually do

670
00:40:33,240 --> 00:40:35,560
way, way better. If you tie your hands behind your back, close your eyes. Your

671
00:40:35,580 --> 00:40:39,520
eyes aren't part of it. Yeah, eyes just move. There's your mouth, keep it shut

672
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:44,580
and hey me fortnight. You only have to use a controller. Caleb stop sticking

673
00:40:44,580 --> 00:40:47,100
out your tongue like you're Michael Jordan. Every single time you play. I

674
00:40:47,100 --> 00:40:48,700
don't know why I do that shit. I'm sitting there.

675
00:40:48,700 --> 00:40:54,300
Huh? Yes, I stick out my tongue when I play video. No, you can tell the

676
00:40:54,300 --> 00:40:58,100
controller. I told my whole body. I'm jumping up and down. I think that the

677
00:40:58,100 --> 00:41:01,940
whole thing came first. The commercial showing the people. It has to be. It

678
00:41:01,940 --> 00:41:05,020
has to be the commercial trying to make it seem like it's real life. Yeah,

679
00:41:05,540 --> 00:41:08,400
that's definitely it, because there's no reason why you should be tilting,

680
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:11,660
because it's realistic. I guess if you're playing such a good game, you do

681
00:41:11,660 --> 00:41:14,220
it, but I feel like the commercial really made it into a thing yeah

682
00:41:14,220 --> 00:41:19,240
or is that or is that as a really nature? It is so funny. It is the full

683
00:41:19,240 --> 00:41:22,640
equivalent of like the thing of like people getting scared by the train

684
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:25,820
coming towards the screen on the old silent movie of like just playing an

685
00:41:25,820 --> 00:41:28,860
old like and like seeing a commercial. So I'm playing it like an N sixty four

686
00:41:28,860 --> 00:41:30,920
game where it's like three triangles on the screen. You're going

687
00:41:33,740 --> 00:41:34,460
like a lover

688
00:41:34,460 --> 00:41:40,220
playing pong. Yeah, like whoa. Can you imagine how amazing that felt to play

689
00:41:40,220 --> 00:41:44,900
pong for the first time? Oh, wait, isn't it kind of cruelly ironic that back in

690
00:41:44,900 --> 00:41:47,380
the day they were so concerned with all the ads have to make it seem like the

691
00:41:47,380 --> 00:41:50,980
game is real. It'll be like you see an added old comic book and it'll be for

692
00:41:50,980 --> 00:41:54,020
modal combat and it's like scorpion shooting fire out of the screen. It's

693
00:41:54,020 --> 00:41:57,820
like so real you'll die. That was like the tag line of the game and nowadays

694
00:41:57,820 --> 00:42:01,540
games look so real that a person who is over thirty years old will think that it

695
00:42:01,560 --> 00:42:05,720
of the news yeah and they don't care. They don't advertise like that anymore.

696
00:42:05,720 --> 00:42:06,920
Have you seen those videos of the

697
00:42:06,920 --> 00:42:08,120
GTS

698
00:42:08,120 --> 00:42:11,240
about that? You be a commercial for

699
00:42:11,240 --> 00:42:15,760
that's what they need to bring that ad campaign back of so real. You will die.

700
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:19,320
You think it's real and you will grant that auto commercial where the granny is

701
00:42:19,320 --> 00:42:25,400
watching it and so it's the news used yeah. Once they go, oh my God, what are

702
00:42:25,400 --> 00:42:29,360
you kidding? I could not believe that that existed. It's incredible, but that's

703
00:42:29,400 --> 00:42:33,100
what I mean they need to bring that back technology. It's technology. We should

704
00:42:33,100 --> 00:42:37,840
do that with splatoon put splatoon on the tv and say yeah grandma. This is

705
00:42:37,840 --> 00:42:42,200
happening in a sanctuary city right now, but a little fox news lower third on

706
00:42:42,200 --> 00:42:47,360
there. This is happening right now in in Portland, Oregon. Oh, the splatoons are

707
00:42:47,360 --> 00:42:49,760
back at it. Yes, this is the

708
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:51,560
autonomous

709
00:42:51,560 --> 00:42:57,160
again. They haven't been here since nineteen fifty two.

710
00:42:57,760 --> 00:43:01,280
this is so scary. I think that'd be an easy way to scare. I just I'm saying

711
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:03,880
grant that thought of old people. It's not so much a grant that thought it

712
00:43:03,880 --> 00:43:07,540
looks realistic. That's all these are dumb as right. Yeah, no, they're losing

713
00:43:07,540 --> 00:43:11,000
their vision in their mind. They're bad at my knowledge. They're bad. They're

714
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:15,840
bad. I think an old person uses a damn phone. That is true. Is that you can put

715
00:43:15,840 --> 00:43:20,800
on Viva? People came from an age when the tech, the biggest technology was this

716
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:24,920
was a hoop and a kazoo. Yeah, well, that was small. I was talking about big.

717
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:29,100
the size. Oh yeah, yeah, nowadays we have phones the size of a brick. Yeah,

718
00:43:29,100 --> 00:43:33,660
that's true, but here's the thing, here's the thing back in the back in

719
00:43:33,660 --> 00:43:36,500
their day, the computer was the size of their room. Now the computer is

720
00:43:36,500 --> 00:43:38,500
smaller. They don't know what the hell to do with. Here's a question I

721
00:43:38,500 --> 00:43:41,780
have. I was watching a movie now in New York City. The rooms from from

722
00:43:41,780 --> 00:43:45,020
one thousand and sixty eight. They had in the sixties. I guess they had

723
00:43:45,020 --> 00:43:49,360
computer dating. Yes, but what is how does that work? There's no internet is

724
00:43:49,360 --> 00:43:52,520
that worked. It was a was you want to call it if you want an honest. I do

725
00:43:52,540 --> 00:43:56,580
want an honest answer. It would have you would get like a score for everything

726
00:43:56,580 --> 00:43:59,720
and it would match people based on scores. It wasn't it wasn't like you're

727
00:43:59,720 --> 00:44:04,500
at two different computers. It dated people you used this thing to match make,

728
00:44:04,500 --> 00:44:08,300
but how does it match make to how does it is it like did they get a directory

729
00:44:08,300 --> 00:44:11,900
with everybody and every punch card or whatever has a directory like take a

730
00:44:11,900 --> 00:44:16,580
quiz and then the right, but how does it connect the people do it was a computer

731
00:44:16,580 --> 00:44:20,620
collected data, but the computers aren't connected. No, it was one. It's one

732
00:44:20,660 --> 00:44:25,260
you all go up to yeah. Okay, that makes sense because I guess they wouldn't have

733
00:44:25,260 --> 00:44:27,220
had personal computers back down. So

734
00:44:27,220 --> 00:44:31,740
the library, yes, you'd go to the library. You probably go to like the lab,

735
00:44:31,740 --> 00:44:35,860
you'd go to like the factory, you'd go to a lab and you can be in the that's

736
00:44:35,860 --> 00:44:39,220
crazy. I like lunch more than breakfast and you'd have a wife because you

737
00:44:39,220 --> 00:44:42,660
couldn't also you couldn't not marry the first person that you know. Of course

738
00:44:42,660 --> 00:44:46,300
not. Yeah, what do you? Yeah, you're you're so ugly. You're going to the

739
00:44:46,300 --> 00:44:50,540
computer for a date back then. Exactly. Yeah. Back then. That was a problem. Now

740
00:44:50,580 --> 00:44:54,080
everyone's got a dating app on their phone technology. Now you used to use a

741
00:44:54,080 --> 00:44:56,980
computer to date. Now you date the computer.

742
00:44:56,980 --> 00:45:02,020
Now you fucking boot up the computer and your phone is a computer and dating

743
00:45:02,020 --> 00:45:07,060
nowadays has become fucking yes, and what have fingering fingering as well

744
00:45:07,060 --> 00:45:12,360
and getting in what happened to our ways. Nowadays, everyone's got a dating

745
00:45:12,360 --> 00:45:15,940
app on their phone. You type in a random number, you just call somebody and

746
00:45:15,940 --> 00:45:17,460
hopefully it's a woman that loves you.

747
00:45:18,820 --> 00:45:22,600
that's how I met my girlfriend. You just called some random called some random

748
00:45:22,600 --> 00:45:23,120
numbers.

749
00:45:23,120 --> 00:45:29,040
I ever found a lifelong love a Romeo, though. I like that. I've heard that in

750
00:45:29,040 --> 00:45:29,720
a long time.

751
00:45:29,720 --> 00:45:32,020
Is this a Romeo dial

752
00:45:32,020 --> 00:45:37,980
new technology? Bring that back? Yeah, Romeo. That's what they were trying to

753
00:45:37,980 --> 00:45:40,720
do with chat roulette, but everyone got on there starting throwing their thing

754
00:45:40,720 --> 00:45:43,700
out. I'm turning the Romeo. Unfortunately, that's the modern way is

755
00:45:43,700 --> 00:45:47,500
to take your thing out on technology. Technology has made it so people think

756
00:45:47,500 --> 00:45:51,380
you need to whip out your thing a me. Let's talk about our personalities

757
00:45:51,380 --> 00:45:54,020
first and then we'll show our thing. We'll show our things to see if they're

758
00:45:54,020 --> 00:45:59,220
compatible. If if my thing doesn't fit in your thing, we not dating no real

759
00:45:59,220 --> 00:46:01,260
shit. If my thing better be big,

760
00:46:01,260 --> 00:46:08,420
better be the size of moon, your thing better be the size of my thing and no

761
00:46:08,420 --> 00:46:08,900
different.

762
00:46:08,900 --> 00:46:14,820
It better fit perfectly girl. It better be like a locking key first day and yeah

763
00:46:14,860 --> 00:46:18,060
just saying I mean we're having a good time, but I better fit perfectly. It

764
00:46:18,060 --> 00:46:21,580
better not it better. I better not be able to wiggle it. I'm looking for my

765
00:46:21,580 --> 00:46:22,260
glass slipper.

766
00:46:22,260 --> 00:46:23,980
No,

767
00:46:23,980 --> 00:46:28,860
I'm not putting my foot in it's just a metal. Okay, you're going to put your

768
00:46:28,860 --> 00:46:32,140
foot in her. Well, I'm not Cinderella. First of all, and her thing's not a

769
00:46:32,140 --> 00:46:36,820
shoe can't wear. Some girls things are like shoes. That's true. Oh, leather

770
00:46:36,820 --> 00:46:41,300
dusty, not as comfortable as I'm ten, unquares at the barbican the things.

771
00:46:41,300 --> 00:46:44,740
Here's a new technology laces on the thing. So you put your thing in, then

772
00:46:44,780 --> 00:46:47,080
you tighten it up there. Okay,

773
00:46:47,080 --> 00:46:53,920
with like meat string, like you're tying like you're making a

774
00:46:53,920 --> 00:46:59,600
I can't even bring myself to say any anatomical phrase. Don't you have

775
00:46:59,600 --> 00:46:59,940
something

776
00:46:59,940 --> 00:47:06,200
just talking about stuff we're talking about we're talking about tying up a

777
00:47:06,200 --> 00:47:10,160
segway. You were talking about tied up a put your put you with a butcher twine

778
00:47:10,160 --> 00:47:12,800
is a thing of the past. Let's talk about the future.

779
00:47:14,160 --> 00:47:17,840
is that a thing of the past? I used to do that in the seventeen fifties. That was

780
00:47:17,840 --> 00:47:21,000
what they did when they got on a man. Okay, wait speaking of the seventeen

781
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:25,100
fifties used to be looser back then, because God hadn't intervened yet yeah,

782
00:47:25,100 --> 00:47:29,340
so they had to they had to make do they what they would do is they would take

783
00:47:29,340 --> 00:47:32,780
whale tendon from their whaling ships on Nantucket originated in Nantucket.

784
00:47:32,780 --> 00:47:36,900
They'd come back and they take the put it in a bucket. They put it in a bucket

785
00:47:36,900 --> 00:47:40,720
and they'd scrub all the flesh and fat off until it was just a tendon and they'd

786
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:44,640
put it in their wife. They they and this is where the saying sleep tight came

787
00:47:44,640 --> 00:47:45,000
from.

788
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:51,160
It's an old saying from the seventeen hundreds is in Nantucket and Salem,

789
00:47:51,160 --> 00:47:54,640
Massachusetts, so the northeast kind of had the market quarter on the corner

790
00:47:54,640 --> 00:47:59,040
on this stuff, because typically in the they did it in other regions, but it

791
00:47:59,040 --> 00:48:01,820
was more technology you're speaking about the more ancient tech. They use

792
00:48:01,820 --> 00:48:06,280
crab pinchers and scorpion pin speaking of speaking of the seventeen hundreds.

793
00:48:06,280 --> 00:48:10,680
Have you seen this? Have you seen this? There's this art exhibit in Melbourne

794
00:48:10,680 --> 00:48:15,160
Australia where they used... I've not been. I haven't been to this man.

795
00:48:15,160 --> 00:48:19,720
They used this... I've never been there. They used AI technology

796
00:48:19,720 --> 00:48:22,940
to make these portraits of these two

797
00:48:22,940 --> 00:48:27,840
men who were apparently in love with each other that got marooned on an island

798
00:48:27,840 --> 00:48:29,240
because they were... Sorry, wait, I'm sorry.

799
00:48:29,240 --> 00:48:33,760
You just said two men. Two men who were in love with each other on the East India Company.

800
00:48:33,760 --> 00:48:35,080
Sounds Australian to me.

801
00:48:35,080 --> 00:48:39,000
And they made these two... Everything's backwards. They made these two AI portraits.

802
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:40,960
flush the wrong way. The men are in love,

803
00:48:40,960 --> 00:48:45,440
but just think about the thing about that, though. Imagine you're out on the

804
00:48:45,440 --> 00:48:49,640
East India Company right. You fall in love with that every day. You fall in

805
00:48:49,640 --> 00:48:52,560
love with another man eating tea. You fall in love with another man. You're

806
00:48:52,560 --> 00:48:57,000
like I want I'm going to I want you. I'm going to do it with this guy. They

807
00:48:57,000 --> 00:49:00,960
don't have that. That's the bravest guy in the world, because they got no

808
00:49:00,960 --> 00:49:02,760
toilet paper or anything on that ship.

809
00:49:02,760 --> 00:49:07,360
Well, but I do I think over ninety per say were being they were bad at white.

810
00:49:07,400 --> 00:49:10,600
I think we're not very little. Washington, your ass was not invented

811
00:49:10,600 --> 00:49:14,000
until the 70s when Red Fox came. So was washing your pussy man,

812
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:17,200
but also back then they had higher tolerance because they were eating

813
00:49:17,200 --> 00:49:22,200
meat called dirt. Yeah, yeah, they were. They don't. They don't care as

814
00:49:22,200 --> 00:49:25,200
much if they're, you know, there's they made these AI. They made these

815
00:49:25,200 --> 00:49:28,700
AI portraits of these two, these two men who are apparently marooned

816
00:49:28,700 --> 00:49:31,000
brown. It's just two white twinks.

817
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:36,000
It's just twinks. It's just just back then. It's just shirtless twinks like

818
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:43,000
Is that the exhibit is just two shirtless twinks on these monitors? And

819
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:46,460
the story is like, "These two men were marooned after they fell in love with

820
00:49:46,460 --> 00:49:49,900
each other." And it's like, "Why? You could have put them in some clothes.

821
00:49:49,900 --> 00:49:52,700
You could have put them in a pirate outfit." They're marooned, man. They

822
00:49:52,700 --> 00:49:55,760
probably were in a loin cloth. Yeah, but they don't even look dirty. They

823
00:49:55,760 --> 00:49:58,920
don't even look like they've been marooned at all. It's just two white

824
00:49:58,920 --> 00:50:02,580
twinks on a fucking... On two computer monitors. I'm all in on this exhibit

825
00:50:02,580 --> 00:50:05,140
and I'm gonna be donating. You're gonna be donating? I would like to invest

826
00:50:05,140 --> 00:50:07,780
in this. I think that we should you're going on this. I believe that gay

827
00:50:07,780 --> 00:50:10,340
relationships should be rendered in a I yeah

828
00:50:10,340 --> 00:50:15,340
and you said nowhere else. I didn't say that, but I was yeah, that's what I

829
00:50:15,340 --> 00:50:19,900
don't mean that, though. I actually think I actually watch a lot of gay porn

830
00:50:19,900 --> 00:50:23,140
honestly. A relationship said nobody take that the wrong way. I'm

831
00:50:23,140 --> 00:50:25,100
actually think

832
00:50:25,100 --> 00:50:30,020
gay porn. I actually actually, actually, I think I know. I think we need to learn

833
00:50:30,020 --> 00:50:33,820
the slang. We need to keep a out of gay relationships. Stay out of gay people's

834
00:50:33,860 --> 00:50:37,800
business. Yeah, thank you. You get these computers away from these gay people

835
00:50:37,800 --> 00:50:38,400
pull up my

836
00:50:38,400 --> 00:50:41,400
they don't know how to use them. They're

837
00:50:41,400 --> 00:50:46,220
new type of where they're putting. They're just throwing words together.

838
00:50:46,220 --> 00:50:49,480
They don't know what is why you call my mom a cunt. Have you guys ever have you

839
00:50:49,480 --> 00:50:52,720
guys ever seen the movie dress to kill the Brian to palm a moving? No, this is

840
00:50:52,720 --> 00:50:55,400
the only context I can ever think of to bring this scene up and this is so

841
00:50:55,400 --> 00:50:58,000
funny. There's a scene, so it's a there's a scene at the end of the movie

842
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:03,620
where Nancy Allen is explaining to Keith Gordon about how a vagina plasty works

843
00:51:03,660 --> 00:51:07,300
like a sex change, okay and and Keith Gordon, he plays like an inventor like

844
00:51:07,300 --> 00:51:10,460
computer nerd type character and she's like telling him all these details of

845
00:51:10,460 --> 00:51:10,940
how they

846
00:51:10,940 --> 00:51:15,580
turn a penis into a vagina and then at the end he's like at the end, he's like

847
00:51:15,580 --> 00:51:19,060
oh geez, I don't know about all that. I guess I'll just stick to my computers.

848
00:51:19,060 --> 00:51:25,420
The way the one that is aged the funniest of all time, it's age pretty

849
00:51:25,420 --> 00:51:30,220
well. Actually, in terms of very, very terms of movie dialogue about vagina

850
00:51:30,260 --> 00:51:33,700
Vaginoplasty. That's probably up there. I don't know. The only other representation

851
00:51:33,700 --> 00:51:36,140
in media of a Vaginoplasty is

852
00:51:36,140 --> 00:51:40,580
Mr Garrison. Yeah, yeah. That I can think of.

853
00:51:40,580 --> 00:51:44,540
And also, I guess that's the better one. And also, my very not accurate

854
00:51:44,540 --> 00:51:47,620
educational video I tried to make a couple of years ago, where I did a 3D

855
00:51:47,620 --> 00:51:52,220
model that just does this of the penis, just pushes it, pushes it in,

856
00:51:52,220 --> 00:51:58,820
and then a green check mark, ding! Like a WarioWare minigame. You took a 3D

857
00:51:58,860 --> 00:52:01,820
got on like dad's three D and hit the extrude, but yeah on the P is it

858
00:52:01,820 --> 00:52:03,980
pulls it back to basically we start with the

859
00:52:03,980 --> 00:52:08,220
we pull it back negative a hundred and then I'm done

860
00:52:08,220 --> 00:52:12,260
okay. Here's my technology week. I pulled this from a bunch of different

861
00:52:12,260 --> 00:52:14,940
websites, a bunch of different technology blogs and we're going to talk

862
00:52:14,940 --> 00:52:19,180
about not by do we be it's by me and we're going to talk about go by that.

863
00:52:19,180 --> 00:52:21,860
No, I don't want to go by that. I hate that name. I think it's a we be oh

864
00:52:21,860 --> 00:52:25,140
it's different from dubia. I'm going to start it now. Here's from a bunch of

865
00:52:25,140 --> 00:52:28,500
different websites. Here's ten future technologies that will change the world

866
00:52:28,580 --> 00:52:32,000
first. Technology has made man easy to work and has changed the way of

867
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:36,000
thinking. Now, scientist has much more ideas for change this world. Here are

868
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:39,520
the top ten unbelievable technologies that can easily change our world

869
00:52:39,520 --> 00:52:42,180
completely. I'm just gonna be jumping around here. That's fun, but number

870
00:52:42,180 --> 00:52:47,000
nine is virtual reality. VR is not just a technology. This is a best proof

871
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:50,720
of being doing everything in this world. Nobody had dream about this

872
00:52:50,720 --> 00:52:54,020
technology, but now it seems like reality. Our destiny is to become what

873
00:52:54,020 --> 00:52:57,360
we think, to have our thoughts become our bodies and our bodies become our

874
00:52:57,380 --> 00:53:01,400
thoughts when we looking towards the future is lot of talking about virtual

875
00:53:01,400 --> 00:53:05,000
reality. The first traces of virtual reality came from the world of science

876
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:08,720
fiction. Now future can be totally chained through this unbelievable

877
00:53:08,720 --> 00:53:12,820
technology. Ultimately, you can enter a virtual world in the cupboard in your

878
00:53:12,820 --> 00:53:13,360
living room.

879
00:53:13,360 --> 00:53:17,640
They're gonna have a virtual reality cupboard. You know, we are I was singing

880
00:53:17,640 --> 00:53:20,540
about this. VR is such a funny technology because you think it's going

881
00:53:20,540 --> 00:53:25,340
to be this future amazing change your life kind of thing, and it is for ten

882
00:53:25,360 --> 00:53:27,980
ten minutes, but then for seventy five percent of people you instantly

883
00:53:27,980 --> 00:53:31,120
vomit. If you play for more than yeah, and it's also that you're you're

884
00:53:31,120 --> 00:53:35,880
entering another world, the cyber world, so you can play egg catch yeah look. I

885
00:53:35,880 --> 00:53:40,000
can move my I can move. Oh my God, it's so realistic. I can move two fingers.

886
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:44,440
Yeah, wow, wow, whoa yeah, you just do most of the time in VR. You're doing

887
00:53:44,440 --> 00:53:48,000
this now. Finally, in VR, you can experience being born as a baby with a

888
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:50,000
birth defect where you have no legs or hands,

889
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:54,640
and if you move, you're going to yank, you're going to yank a cable out and

890
00:53:54,680 --> 00:53:58,000
like your computer, you can step on your experience being born as literally

891
00:53:58,000 --> 00:53:59,500
belial from basket case.

892
00:53:59,500 --> 00:54:04,600
That is exactly the body that you have in vr. You have two arms and a head

893
00:54:04,600 --> 00:54:05,760
and that's completely it

894
00:54:05,760 --> 00:54:09,000
being carried around by your brother. This is what it would be like if

895
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:15,040
belial from from basket case could look at a beach. Yes, oh my God, it looks so

896
00:54:15,040 --> 00:54:19,200
realistic. Number one is autonomous robots. Now this is totally that

897
00:54:19,200 --> 00:54:23,800
technology about which we can say that what a technology this a very dangerous

898
00:54:23,840 --> 00:54:28,240
technology as soon as twenty thirty, a technological dollar sign angularity

899
00:54:28,240 --> 00:54:31,800
will emerge with the leading theory being that artificial intelligence in

900
00:54:31,800 --> 00:54:34,400
the form of autonomous and we're seeing a lot of dollar signs. Yeah, this is

901
00:54:34,400 --> 00:54:38,880
written by a hacker or some kind of technologist. Robots might rival humans

902
00:54:38,880 --> 00:54:43,360
in independent thinking and creativity. So to say it plainly, robots will

903
00:54:43,360 --> 00:54:46,440
surpass humans in intelligence. This is very hard to believe that one day our

904
00:54:46,440 --> 00:54:49,840
friend will be a robot and give us advises and make jokes with us. We have

905
00:54:49,880 --> 00:54:54,180
friend user robot to be oh yeah to be oh three here's the next blog. I found this

906
00:54:54,180 --> 00:54:57,620
one is called tech informative. It says tech informative is a professional

907
00:54:57,620 --> 00:55:00,780
technical information platform here. We will provide you only interesting

908
00:55:00,780 --> 00:55:04,160
content, which will you will like very much. We're dedicated to providing you

909
00:55:04,160 --> 00:55:08,280
the best of technical information with a focus on dependability and information.

910
00:55:08,280 --> 00:55:11,520
We're working to turn our passion for technical information into a booming

911
00:55:11,520 --> 00:55:15,820
online website. Well, it seems nice. It's a great website. Here's the menu bar. So

912
00:55:15,820 --> 00:55:19,640
we have tech informative. It's here's the different things we have home future

913
00:55:19,660 --> 00:55:24,980
the world, electronics and reborts. What is rebord? So I saw rebords and I

914
00:55:24,980 --> 00:55:29,500
thought, oh, maybe this is supposed to be reports. What is a report? So let's

915
00:55:29,500 --> 00:55:32,280
click to the next slide here and I'll read you what it is rebord, a

916
00:55:32,280 --> 00:55:32,780
vehicle,

917
00:55:32,780 --> 00:55:36,740
rebord, a car and robotic vehicle technology.

918
00:55:36,740 --> 00:55:44,020
This is not rebords. This is rebords as like a babe. I'm a rebord. I see,

919
00:55:44,020 --> 00:55:48,780
and this is a picture of a rebord vehicle. It's a car that's standing up

920
00:55:48,820 --> 00:55:52,980
kind of a standing car. So report means a standard right report was making me

921
00:55:52,980 --> 00:55:56,040
laugh so hard when I found this when I discovered that report

922
00:55:56,040 --> 00:55:59,020
I my reboard

923
00:55:59,020 --> 00:56:03,800
here's some other reports they have on their website and they report road meet

924
00:56:03,800 --> 00:56:09,200
Mars cat robotic cats, AI robotic cat naughty, very little pet lucky dug, not

925
00:56:09,200 --> 00:56:12,180
all cats have fur and also the same holds true for cats of the robotic

926
00:56:12,180 --> 00:56:16,080
persuasion. The lucky dug naughty, very little pet incorporates a cartoonish

927
00:56:16,120 --> 00:56:20,320
look is created of onerous plastic and includes a toy bottle of milk and a

928
00:56:20,320 --> 00:56:24,820
little blue basket to take a seat in. It says it says not all cats have for and

929
00:56:24,820 --> 00:56:28,440
also the same holds true for cats of the robotic persuasion, but some do that

930
00:56:28,440 --> 00:56:32,260
means that some robotic can re boarded cats have do have her. There are some

931
00:56:32,260 --> 00:56:35,620
re board cats with first. You guys ever feel like really like the biggest

932
00:56:35,620 --> 00:56:43,500
technological boom to me was the year where I was a kid and I saw the robot

933
00:56:43,540 --> 00:56:47,880
dogs that do back flips and the purple catch up. I was like yes, that is this

934
00:56:47,880 --> 00:56:51,780
is like an only I live in the future yeah speaking of robotic dogs. Here's a

935
00:56:51,780 --> 00:56:57,140
rebord dog picture here for us this next one here and this caption says a

936
00:56:57,140 --> 00:57:02,160
four lawful robot can learn to walk in an hour like an a like a invigorated

937
00:57:02,160 --> 00:57:02,520
full

938
00:57:02,520 --> 00:57:06,240
and there's a picture of a robotic dog and then here's what we have about this.

939
00:57:06,240 --> 00:57:11,560
The Boston Dynamics has developed a four legged golem for analysis comes agency

940
00:57:11,620 --> 00:57:15,200
DARPA agency, federal agency, government agency, bureau office, authority,

941
00:57:15,200 --> 00:57:19,700
defense, advanced research projects, agency referred to as big dog that they

942
00:57:19,700 --> 00:57:23,840
claim is the most advanced quadruped golem on earth. Huge dog will run at

943
00:57:23,840 --> 00:57:27,480
four miles per hour, climb thirty five degree slopes and that's not thirty

944
00:57:27,480 --> 00:57:31,160
five. That's thirty five five degrees without getting tired. Yeah, it's an

945
00:57:31,160 --> 00:57:34,380
endurance thing and carry three hundred and forty pounds. However, the four

946
00:57:34,380 --> 00:57:38,360
most spectacular feature is its dynamic walking. Huge dog will endure

947
00:57:38,400 --> 00:57:42,900
slithering and even being pushed, so it's not scared of snakes. Its behavior is

948
00:57:42,900 --> 00:57:47,840
specified. It approaches the disreputable uncanny valley. I don't think that those

949
00:57:47,840 --> 00:57:51,940
things are in the uncanny valley. No, there's no they yeah, because they're

950
00:57:51,940 --> 00:57:55,340
just as they look like normal. I mean look at that. I've always it looks like

951
00:57:55,340 --> 00:57:59,880
an invigorated full yeah to me a quadruped. I always say that stuff looks

952
00:57:59,880 --> 00:58:02,900
like an invigorate like when I see like my when my nephew first started crawling

953
00:58:02,900 --> 00:58:06,100
and said, oh he looks like an invigorated full. I can even with stand

954
00:58:06,140 --> 00:58:07,840
slithering. Oh yeah and pushing

955
00:58:07,840 --> 00:58:15,780
during slithering. Wow, this invigorated full and dirt slithering so well.

956
00:58:15,780 --> 00:58:21,160
All right, here's our next tech blog top ten high tech inventions, maybe in

957
00:58:21,160 --> 00:58:24,800
twenty thirty vision of the future ten high tech inventions will hopefully be

958
00:58:24,800 --> 00:58:30,040
using in twenty thirty. Here's the first one number four immortal immortality and

959
00:58:30,040 --> 00:58:33,920
body sharing. While computers get smarter, the brain it link will also get

960
00:58:33,960 --> 00:58:37,700
better. So you'll use external it more until most of your mind is outside your

961
00:58:37,700 --> 00:58:41,360
brain. When your body dies, you'll only lose the bits still based in the brain.

962
00:58:41,360 --> 00:58:45,060
Most of your mind will carry on. You'll go to your funeral, buy an android body

963
00:58:45,060 --> 00:58:49,000
and carry on. Death won't be a career problem. If you don't want to use an

964
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:52,180
android, maybe you'll link into your friend's bodies and share them just as

965
00:58:52,180 --> 00:58:57,200
students hang out on friends sofas. Life really begins after death. Would you guys

966
00:58:57,200 --> 00:59:00,760
link into your friend's body just as if you would link into their sofa? Seems

967
00:59:00,980 --> 00:59:05,120
relationship, believe sexual yeah. I don't think that I would upload my brain to a

968
00:59:05,120 --> 00:59:08,360
computer. I don't think I would do it. I would not do it to my friend's body.

969
00:59:08,360 --> 00:59:11,880
Wouldn't it be so scary to upload my myself to my friend's body? I would

970
00:59:11,880 --> 00:59:14,980
upload myself to my friend's body against their will. I feel like it was

971
00:59:14,980 --> 00:59:20,880
here's the right. I think the first hour that you're a robot is probably similar

972
00:59:20,880 --> 00:59:24,240
to coming out of wisdom tooth surgery, where you kind of are saying anything

973
00:59:24,240 --> 00:59:28,440
definitely, you know you're just like oh zero zero yeah things are still getting

974
00:59:28,480 --> 00:59:31,380
Yeah, and then people are putting that together and it turns out you're telling

975
00:59:31,380 --> 00:59:34,840
secrets, 'Oh, what happened at camp back in the day?' So, I wouldn't want to do

976
00:59:34,840 --> 00:59:38,900
that. That's the laughing gas, right? I've been awake every single time I got

977
00:59:38,900 --> 00:59:41,840
my wisdom teeth out. You've never been put under? No, it's way cheaper. You've

978
00:59:41,840 --> 00:59:44,160
never done a surgery where you're put under? I got this taken out,

979
00:59:44,160 --> 00:59:48,240
it took them five minutes, they pulled it out and then I took the train home.

980
00:59:48,240 --> 00:59:52,980
The only two times I was put under is I had my tonsils out and then they

981
00:59:52,980 --> 00:59:54,980
exploded and I had to get them,

982
00:59:56,200 --> 01:00:00,040
your sutures exploded and I had to go get it redone. Does laughing gas count as

983
01:00:00,040 --> 01:00:03,980
going under? I think so. I don't know. No. I think I was, I was awake the whole

984
01:00:03,980 --> 01:00:07,040
time. Yeah, I was awake for- That's the only time I ever got anesthesia was-

985
01:00:07,040 --> 01:00:11,360
You never done general anesthesia? No. It's scary, 'cause you're just- I did

986
01:00:11,360 --> 01:00:14,000
local. I was terrified of it. You don't dream- I'm completely terrified of it.

987
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:18,080
It's a complete pause. The scary thing is when you, those people who are

988
01:00:18,080 --> 01:00:20,580
allergic to it- I know, that's, you just die. Yeah, yeah. That's why I'm

989
01:00:20,580 --> 01:00:23,300
terrified of it. Well, you don't die. I never- You die. You can, you can die,

990
01:00:23,320 --> 01:00:27,120
even there's also a row who on anesthesia. You also can choke on your

991
01:00:27,120 --> 01:00:30,640
there's people who take on a under there's people who go under general

992
01:00:30,640 --> 01:00:32,680
general to not do it and then they

993
01:00:32,680 --> 01:00:33,780
they

994
01:00:33,780 --> 01:00:39,280
are fully paralyzed, but they feel everything. Oh yeah, I heard about that

995
01:00:39,280 --> 01:00:43,060
on guard. Any this is a technology we need to eliminate. Get rid of

996
01:00:43,060 --> 01:00:46,000
anesthesia, whatever happened to a coconut over the head right

997
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:47,480
to do that.

998
01:00:47,480 --> 01:00:52,440
Why was that my I don't know I tried to say Boeing bonk, but it went

999
01:00:52,440 --> 01:00:58,040
my kind of the a little bit bunk. That's what I meant to say yeah, and then you

1000
01:00:58,040 --> 01:01:01,880
do the surgery. Yeah, remove a leg. Here's the next technology we're going to talk

1001
01:01:01,880 --> 01:01:04,040
about is smart yogurt.

1002
01:01:04,040 --> 01:01:08,680
Smart you a quad core PC has for processors all sharing the same chip

1003
01:01:08,680 --> 01:01:12,280
instead of the single one there used to be. This will increase until computers

1004
01:01:12,280 --> 01:01:15,880
have millions of processors. These might be suspended in jail to keep them cool

1005
01:01:15,880 --> 01:01:19,320
and allow to allow them to be wired together via light beams in separate

1006
01:01:19,360 --> 01:01:22,320
developments, bacteria are being genetically modified to let them make

1007
01:01:22,320 --> 01:01:26,320
electronic components. Putting these together smart yogurt could be the basis

1008
01:01:26,320 --> 01:01:30,080
of future computing with potentially vastly superhuman intelligence. One day

1009
01:01:30,080 --> 01:01:35,320
your best friend could be a yogurt wow that's a pretty good rap lyric yeah me

1010
01:01:35,320 --> 01:01:40,380
like about used to be broke me and my my family was quad core all sharing a chip

1011
01:01:40,380 --> 01:01:43,020
damn my best friend was a yogurt and now he's a

1012
01:01:43,020 --> 01:01:48,480
well yeah you got to make it gangsta yeah. I guess what I like about this is

1013
01:01:49,080 --> 01:01:52,480
this is kind of to tech to crazy technological advances, where one

1014
01:01:52,480 --> 01:01:56,280
computers become a yogurt and second of all that a computer would ever be your

1015
01:01:56,280 --> 01:02:00,400
best friend. What do you exactly this person and one by a yogurt? They I

1016
01:02:00,400 --> 01:02:03,820
think it's pretty fucking clear a smart yoga. You think it's you think it's

1017
01:02:03,820 --> 01:02:06,200
bacterial cultures is basically yogurt

1018
01:02:06,200 --> 01:02:10,360
and they're saying it could be a computer gel and bacteria equals.

1019
01:02:10,360 --> 01:02:12,200
They're saying that's doodle God recipe for

1020
01:02:12,200 --> 01:02:17,400
for yogurt is bacteria plus gel exactly well, not only that a computer would be

1021
01:02:17,440 --> 01:02:22,400
my best friend that some yogurt would be yeah. They're kind of three things. I

1022
01:02:22,400 --> 01:02:25,440
think that in twenty thirty are my best friend could be a yogurt, whether or not

1023
01:02:25,440 --> 01:02:30,280
it's computerized. That's what I want. Absolutely yogurt friend. Yes, my do

1024
01:02:30,280 --> 01:02:36,660
like like oh, I say yo yogurt yeah yogurt. Gurt is a name. Gurt is his

1025
01:02:36,660 --> 01:02:41,160
name's Gurt, so the ad is like you say yogurt and he wakes up like Alexa and it

1026
01:02:41,160 --> 01:02:41,500
would be

1027
01:02:43,160 --> 01:02:46,660
well, he doesn't say anything he's he's today is strawberries. You're going to

1028
01:02:46,660 --> 01:02:50,960
eat today. You will eat strawberry over today. Yeah, you can change the way

1029
01:02:50,960 --> 01:02:55,000
just tell you off part. It's a it's an AI, but that tells you what type of

1030
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:57,840
yogurt you have to eat that I'm not going to eat based on your diet. This is

1031
01:02:57,840 --> 01:03:00,960
stupid. I would eat my friend peach on the bottom yogurt.

1032
01:03:00,960 --> 01:03:06,760
There's a play crunch peach on his stuff like that. Don't say his bottom. What's

1033
01:03:06,760 --> 01:03:10,720
this? It's your robot friend. It's Gert to Gert. It's just Gert. I'm out on

1034
01:03:10,760 --> 01:03:13,720
yogurt all right all right we're going to make a billion dollars. Go ahead

1035
01:03:13,720 --> 01:03:17,520
you're out man, whatever as long as I'm not part of any yogurt company,

1036
01:03:17,520 --> 01:03:22,820
and I'm fine all right here's our here's our last tech blog here. Okay, this is

1037
01:03:22,820 --> 01:03:28,220
top ten future electronic devices for next decades origami DVD player or it

1038
01:03:28,220 --> 01:03:33,340
got me DVD player. This is a cool picture of a little thing where a bunch

1039
01:03:33,340 --> 01:03:37,180
of apps are coming out of it. It's made by apple and it's an apple thing. Do you

1040
01:03:37,200 --> 01:03:42,000
Do you guys remember that one thing that was the wrist phone? Yeah, it was the

1041
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:46,640
light the watch that shot a light onto your projected a phone screen onto your

1042
01:03:46,640 --> 01:03:50,440
I remember that. That sounds cool. Well, they did like a GoFundMe for it where they

1043
01:03:50,440 --> 01:03:56,280
had like like concept art and stuff and then they raised millions of dollars and

1044
01:03:56,280 --> 01:03:58,960
then they started trying to make it and they realized it was completely impossible

1045
01:03:58,960 --> 01:04:04,160
to do it. Of course. It was awesome. Yeah. So this kind of reminds me of that. What

1046
01:04:04,160 --> 01:04:06,840
do you think they did with all that money? Just ran away with it? I mean they

1047
01:04:06,840 --> 01:04:10,880
they didn't run away. Probably still around. They didn't run away. They

1048
01:04:10,880 --> 01:04:14,920
didn't like pull up to get a stick and a bandana. They probably spent it all on

1049
01:04:14,920 --> 01:04:18,640
trying to do the thing. Yeah, they were like okay, got the money time to run

1050
01:04:18,640 --> 01:04:19,400
away from home.

1051
01:04:19,400 --> 01:04:25,040
Okay, I would do if I had a go fund me that big. Here's a here's a piece of

1052
01:04:25,040 --> 01:04:28,480
technology. I'm not making shit. No, here's a piece of technology guys,

1053
01:04:28,480 --> 01:04:33,760
self cleaning auto ordering refrigerator. There are already the so called smart

1054
01:04:33,800 --> 01:04:37,840
refrigerators in the market. Well, this refrigerator takes the technology to all

1055
01:04:37,840 --> 01:04:42,060
new level. This fridge is equipped with nano articulated technology with this

1056
01:04:42,060 --> 01:04:45,380
technology to the independent tiles present in the fridge, move the food

1057
01:04:45,380 --> 01:04:48,600
that needs to be consumed early to the top. The fridge consists of the LCD

1058
01:04:48,600 --> 01:04:52,160
screen, which displays content present in the fridge. This intelligent thing

1059
01:04:52,160 --> 01:04:55,800
also suggests recipe with the available items. It orders the things you need and

1060
01:04:55,800 --> 01:05:00,120
also thrashes the wastage or expired food by itself and for guys for the video

1061
01:05:00,180 --> 01:05:04,480
and for the audio listeners, this auto ordering refrigerator, the picture is of

1062
01:05:04,480 --> 01:05:05,700
us an oven, yes,

1063
01:05:05,700 --> 01:05:11,040
with a stove top yeah. So this is maybe one of the most genius inventions. I've

1064
01:05:11,040 --> 01:05:15,120
kind of makes me a refrigerator that looks exactly like an oven or top this

1065
01:05:15,120 --> 01:05:18,440
hobber cooks. We're hungry. Robert comes in trying to steal your food. He's not

1066
01:05:18,440 --> 01:05:21,520
going to look in the oven, a hot refrigerator yeah yeah. That's also a

1067
01:05:21,520 --> 01:05:24,500
good. That's a really good to stay on living animals yeah

1068
01:05:24,500 --> 01:05:28,320
like lizards yeah, well, a lobster yeah

1069
01:05:29,360 --> 01:05:35,620
lot of water. Yeah, okay, a water. A lizard really is the water. It is a good idea.

1070
01:05:35,620 --> 01:05:38,980
A lizard. You just take the crisper drawer, but you could also fill it with

1071
01:05:38,980 --> 01:05:42,520
water. It doesn't go bad if it stays hot, right? Food doesn't go bad ever. You

1072
01:05:42,520 --> 01:05:45,840
can eat all food. Well, then never mind. Oh yeah, I guess if it stays hot like at

1073
01:05:45,840 --> 01:05:49,920
a buffet. Yeah, so we should go to a buffet this week. I really want to go to

1074
01:05:49,920 --> 01:05:52,600
Golden Corral, but you have to find a good one. Well, fine. Let's find a good

1075
01:05:52,600 --> 01:05:56,720
one. We'll look at reviews. Okay, there's a good Golden Corral. Shut the fuck up.

1076
01:05:57,160 --> 01:06:01,360
I think we got to go back to this golden crowd. We get a prime rib. Oh, we do have

1077
01:06:01,360 --> 01:06:05,740
to go back to Fogo de Chao. Can we go to Fogo de Chao? Dude, you're bleeding me

1078
01:06:05,740 --> 01:06:10,040
dry. You're bleeding me fucking dry. Wait, I can think of a really fucking

1079
01:06:10,040 --> 01:06:14,660
week. I can think of a really good opportunity to go to Fogo de Chao in two

1080
01:06:14,660 --> 01:06:17,120
weeks. Yeah, I can't say it.

1081
01:06:17,120 --> 01:06:20,440
Why? Oh my God, yes.

1082
01:06:20,440 --> 01:06:23,880
Whisper and they have a conference room there.

1083
01:06:26,360 --> 01:06:29,320
he said you're wearing headphones. I can't really tell okay here. I'll mute

1084
01:06:29,320 --> 01:06:30,960
everybody and say it really fast. Okay,

1085
01:06:30,960 --> 01:06:39,200
oh yeah and by the way, bad lip reading turn off the actual bad lip reading,

1086
01:06:39,200 --> 01:06:42,120
good lip reading, try your try your worst

1087
01:06:42,120 --> 01:06:45,920
doing bad lip reading with

1088
01:06:45,920 --> 01:06:53,480
bad lip reading, getting getting hired by the on guys to do all the the White

1089
01:06:53,520 --> 01:06:57,020
house like press conferences thing where they're talking off my all right.

1090
01:06:57,020 --> 01:06:57,580
Here's the next

1091
01:06:57,580 --> 01:07:04,060
food. Here's the next technology. This is a future technology that we will be

1092
01:07:04,060 --> 01:07:09,180
using for the next decade. Firewire, Firewire, Firewire cable transfers data

1093
01:07:09,180 --> 01:07:13,860
between digital devices, also called as I e e thirteen ninety four. This device

1094
01:07:13,860 --> 01:07:17,620
is transfer rate can be as fast as eight hundred megabytes per second. Firewire

1095
01:07:17,620 --> 01:07:21,300
was fast and fire. It is expected to increase up to nearly three point two

1096
01:07:21,340 --> 01:07:26,300
gigabytes per second in the future. Usually FireWire is a hub where nearly 63 devices

1097
01:07:26,300 --> 01:07:29,780
can be connected and the data can be transferred between the devices. This is supported by

1098
01:07:29,780 --> 01:07:35,180
all operating systems like Windows 98 and above, Mac 8.6 and above. Guys, this is a

1099
01:07:35,180 --> 01:07:40,780
cable of the future. FireWire. We miss you so much. We miss you. You did not have your

1100
01:07:40,780 --> 01:07:45,340
day in the sun. Way better. FireWire. They should have changed USB-C to FireWire. We

1101
01:07:45,340 --> 01:07:49,740
should start calling USB FireWire. Blazing fast speed. Alright guys, I have one more

1102
01:07:49,740 --> 01:07:53,100
future technology. All right, I'm excited world, the most futuristic technology of

1103
01:07:53,100 --> 01:07:55,820
all time. I have two slides on it. Go to it now.

1104
01:07:55,820 --> 01:07:57,940
Big wheel bicycle

1105
01:07:57,940 --> 01:08:04,420
and go to the next pick. It's a tractor tire. Oh my God, guys, this is big

1106
01:08:04,420 --> 01:08:08,220
wheel bicycle. I actually didn't even realize how big the wheel was till I

1107
01:08:08,220 --> 01:08:12,540
saw it next to a normal bike. Look at the fucking car. This wheel is bigger

1108
01:08:12,540 --> 01:08:16,620
than a truck than a van. Yeah, you seems like a large tractor. Oh my God,

1109
01:08:16,620 --> 01:08:19,460
bicycle. You could go anywhere on that. This has no caption. It speaks for

1110
01:08:19,460 --> 01:08:23,940
itself. Guys, big wheel bicycle 2030. Yeah. There used to be a guy in my

1111
01:08:23,940 --> 01:08:28,220
hometown in Wilmington who would ride around on all the busiest roads on a

1112
01:08:28,220 --> 01:08:31,980
double decker bike. Oh, yeah. What? Like two bike frames on top of each

1113
01:08:31,980 --> 01:08:34,620
other. There's somebody around here that does that. And it was so clear.

1114
01:08:34,620 --> 01:08:38,460
It was this one bike. It was green on the bottom, red on the top. It was

1115
01:08:38,460 --> 01:08:42,300
the same bike every single time, and it was the same guy every single time.

1116
01:08:42,300 --> 01:08:45,700
And then one day, it was a different guy riding the bike, which means that

1117
01:08:45,700 --> 01:08:47,660
I sold that bike to someone.

1118
01:08:47,660 --> 01:08:48,820
Someone bought it. That's crazy.

1119
01:08:48,820 --> 01:08:51,060
And then that guy kept riding that bike.

1120
01:08:51,060 --> 01:08:52,980
There's somebody around in this neighborhood.

1121
01:08:52,980 --> 01:08:53,900
I've seen his bike.

1122
01:08:53,900 --> 01:08:56,980
He has a double decker bike and it's chained up in front of his apartment.

1123
01:08:56,980 --> 01:08:58,500
(laughs)

1124
01:08:58,500 --> 01:09:00,580
It's like, "Dude, no one's fucking stealing that."

1125
01:09:00,580 --> 01:09:03,220
Here's my other story of a double decker bike.

1126
01:09:03,220 --> 01:09:07,380
Maybe the guy died riding the bike and in his will, he's like to his friend,

1127
01:09:07,380 --> 01:09:12,180
"I leave my double decker bike to my friend and I pray that he can carry on my memory."

1128
01:09:12,180 --> 01:09:14,100
That he can also die on this bike.

1129
01:09:14,100 --> 01:09:18,220
Well, yeah, imagine how pissed off you'd be if you get that bike gets left to you.

1130
01:09:18,220 --> 01:09:20,760
And you have to imagine you get hit on that thing.

1131
01:09:20,760 --> 01:09:23,380
Imagine a car like bumps you in the back.

1132
01:09:23,380 --> 01:09:24,720
Yeah, well, here's the thing.

1133
01:09:24,720 --> 01:09:26,640
It doubles. You go faster.

1134
01:09:26,640 --> 01:09:29,440
You get left that bike and in somebody's will.

1135
01:09:29,440 --> 01:09:32,720
First of all, you can't sell it because someone left it to you in the will.

1136
01:09:32,720 --> 01:09:36,440
Second of all, you can't sell it because who is buying a double decker bike?

1137
01:09:36,440 --> 01:09:39,520
Yeah, nobody is buying that clown.

1138
01:09:39,520 --> 01:09:40,900
A short, a double guy.

1139
01:09:40,900 --> 01:09:43,860
Yeah, a guy, Robert Wadlow, Siamese twin.

1140
01:09:43,900 --> 01:09:45,960
Yeah, they might buy it, but they might buy it.

1141
01:09:45,960 --> 01:09:48,940
Side to Siamese twins that are connected foot to shoulder to

1142
01:09:48,940 --> 01:09:52,900
Siamese twins who have two separate accounts on Facebook on Facebook.

1143
01:09:52,900 --> 01:09:55,340
They're messaging you on Facebook marketplace from two different chats.

1144
01:09:55,340 --> 01:09:58,000
You think they're competing with each other, but they're the same

1145
01:09:58,000 --> 01:09:59,500
until you realize that they're a tennis.

1146
01:09:59,500 --> 01:10:01,500
Do you see half of their head?

1147
01:10:01,500 --> 01:10:04,360
You see half of their heads at each photo, each profile photo.

1148
01:10:04,360 --> 01:10:07,560
So I think these might be $500 for this.

1149
01:10:07,560 --> 01:10:09,360
But you can tell somebody else.

1150
01:10:09,360 --> 01:10:11,260
The hell this guy has a very high shoulder.

1151
01:10:11,260 --> 01:10:12,460
Oh, that's his brother.

1152
01:10:12,460 --> 01:10:13,920
That's his brother's whole body.

1153
01:10:13,920 --> 01:10:14,920
That's his brother's entire body.

1154
01:10:14,920 --> 01:10:15,920
And he's just that.

1155
01:10:15,920 --> 01:10:18,120
That's all he has control over.

1156
01:10:18,120 --> 01:10:22,120
They're connected, like he has no feet because it's his brother's shoulder blades.

1157
01:10:22,120 --> 01:10:26,480
And they're connected foot to shoulder and they live in a house that like one of them

1158
01:10:26,480 --> 01:10:29,560
is sitting at their desk and the other one is like a desk wave.

1159
01:10:29,560 --> 01:10:30,560
That's awesome.

1160
01:10:30,560 --> 01:10:36,280
Is there any Siamese twins where maybe one of the, because one of them's always got it

1161
01:10:36,280 --> 01:10:37,280
worse.

1162
01:10:37,280 --> 01:10:42,080
The one who's got it worse is like on the bottom of the foot or on the ass cheek.

1163
01:10:42,080 --> 01:10:44,800
I think so, yeah. I don't think I've ever seen one.

1164
01:10:44,800 --> 01:10:48,480
I'm sure, I think that it may, it does make it to TV.

1165
01:10:48,480 --> 01:10:49,480
Basket cases.

1166
01:10:49,480 --> 01:10:51,080
Yeah, that's a parasitic twin, that happens too.

1167
01:10:51,080 --> 01:10:52,080
Well, that's also.

1168
01:10:52,080 --> 01:10:55,280
It's like a coato, maybe would be another reference point for someone who doesn't.

1169
01:10:55,280 --> 01:10:56,280
Coato.

1170
01:10:56,280 --> 01:10:57,280
From Total Recall.

1171
01:10:57,280 --> 01:10:58,280
Oh, right, right.

1172
01:10:58,280 --> 01:10:59,280
And also.

1173
01:10:59,280 --> 01:11:00,280
Malignant.

1174
01:11:00,280 --> 01:11:01,280
Malignant.

1175
01:11:01,280 --> 01:11:02,280
Malignant is another one.

1176
01:11:02,280 --> 01:11:03,280
Back of the head.

1177
01:11:03,280 --> 01:11:04,880
Professor Quirrell from Harry Potter.

1178
01:11:04,880 --> 01:11:07,360
Yes, well that's less of a, that's more of a spirit.

1179
01:11:07,360 --> 01:11:08,360
Yeah.

1180
01:11:08,360 --> 01:11:09,360
But it's on the back of his head.

1181
01:11:09,360 --> 01:11:10,360
Yeah, but it's more of a spirit.

1182
01:11:10,360 --> 01:11:11,360
It's still the same concept.

1183
01:11:11,360 --> 01:11:14,200
Conjoined twin and you're a fan of the show. It's not

1184
01:11:14,200 --> 01:11:17,560
Professor Quirrell was not like Voldemort my twin for real

1185
01:11:17,560 --> 01:11:20,120
He didn't think that

1186
01:11:20,120 --> 01:11:23,940
Well, if you're a conjoined twin, can we get them like a bike them something? I don't know

1187
01:11:23,940 --> 01:11:29,680
Why is there conjoined they have enough fucking stuff going they get free shit all the time

1188
01:11:29,680 --> 01:11:33,300
You think they get free refills? Yes

1189
01:11:33,300 --> 01:11:35,840
Yes

1190
01:11:35,840 --> 01:11:37,840
Exactly

1191
01:11:37,840 --> 01:11:39,840
Half Price movie tickets.

1192
01:11:39,840 --> 01:11:41,840
Imagine, imagine, imagine.

1193
01:11:41,840 --> 01:11:49,840
A conjoined twin walks into a restaurant and the guy's like, "Uh-uh, you're both paying, you're not sharing sodas. You're both paying for a soda."

1194
01:11:49,840 --> 01:11:53,840
It's only one stomach, but you taste it twice.

1195
01:11:53,840 --> 01:11:57,840
That's really tickling you.

1196
01:11:57,840 --> 01:12:04,840
I don't know why that's so funny to me. That's not that funny at all, but a guy being like, "You guys are not sharing anything here."

1197
01:12:04,840 --> 01:12:05,840
Kind of ableist.

1198
01:12:05,840 --> 01:12:06,840
Problematic.

1199
01:12:06,840 --> 01:12:08,840
You know that a lot of times it's conjoined twins.

1200
01:12:08,840 --> 01:12:10,840
I already told you 2024 is my fuck it year.

1201
01:12:10,840 --> 01:12:14,840
The parents have to make the choice to kill one of them basically.

1202
01:12:14,840 --> 01:12:16,840
And that's what you're joking about.

1203
01:12:16,840 --> 01:12:18,840
I already said just a second ago.

1204
01:12:18,840 --> 01:12:20,840
And they pass on very early in life.

1205
01:12:20,840 --> 01:12:22,840
Fuck all the bullshit.

1206
01:12:22,840 --> 01:12:25,840
And if one twin passes the other twin often passes as well shortly thereafter.

1207
01:12:25,840 --> 01:12:28,840
And you might think that it's some kind of physical reaction.

1208
01:12:28,840 --> 01:12:30,840
It's heartbreak. It's despair.

1209
01:12:30,840 --> 01:12:32,840
Guess what?

1210
01:12:32,840 --> 01:12:34,840
It's my fuck it year.

1211
01:12:34,840 --> 01:12:38,640
really sound it. I mean, yeah, it was very insensitive. So I'm being

1212
01:12:38,640 --> 01:12:41,720
insensitive. I was fuck it. I'm being insensitive. What do you think? What do

1213
01:12:41,720 --> 01:12:46,800
you think? When I can join join twin there, there are young can join twin

1214
01:12:46,800 --> 01:12:50,960
pair. One of them has finally one of them has hit the mental maturity age

1215
01:12:50,960 --> 01:12:55,080
where for Halloween they would like to dress as something funny, but the other

1216
01:12:55,080 --> 01:12:58,320
one still wants to or scary someone else. The other one still wants to dress as a

1217
01:12:58,320 --> 01:13:01,800
superhero that is and they're going to be reading and one of them has the flash

1218
01:13:01,800 --> 01:13:05,120
costume and the other one is dressed as a skeleton. Yeah, and they open it. Oh

1219
01:13:05,120 --> 01:13:05,640
good cause

1220
01:13:05,640 --> 01:13:11,720
that's really good. Yeah, that's really scary. You scared me for this is a good

1221
01:13:11,720 --> 01:13:14,680
costume. The flash getting chased by a skeleton. Oh wow

1222
01:13:14,680 --> 01:13:18,680
damn the Halloween costume game for being a conjoined twin would actually be

1223
01:13:18,680 --> 01:13:23,480
insane. Yeah, what why I mean you just get so I mean you think about how fun.

1224
01:13:23,480 --> 01:13:27,840
Oh yeah, just costume. Yeah, you could be the guys from stuff. You could there's

1225
01:13:27,880 --> 01:13:31,640
so many things you could do. I like conjoined twins. I like to play with

1226
01:13:31,640 --> 01:13:35,800
them. Yeah, I mean, if you are a conjoined twin fan of the show, Patrick

1227
01:13:35,800 --> 01:13:39,320
already said, we'll get we'll make a shirt for you. No, we'll make a shirt.

1228
01:13:39,320 --> 01:13:42,200
We'll make a shirt. You go ahead and try to make a shirt for them.

1229
01:13:42,200 --> 01:13:48,120
Come on, we will make a special. You cannot have picked a worse thing to

1230
01:13:48,120 --> 01:13:49,720
prom. What are you talking about? There's

1231
01:13:49,720 --> 01:13:54,640
something specifically for you. We'll make one shirt, but you have to share

1232
01:13:54,640 --> 01:13:58,640
it again. I'm not making too much.

1233
01:13:58,640 --> 01:14:00,640
You're not doing good with that. Okay.

1234
01:14:00,640 --> 01:14:02,640
I'm not doing good with that. What do you mean by that?

1235
01:14:02,640 --> 01:14:04,640
Guys, you're being offensive, man.

1236
01:14:04,640 --> 01:14:06,640
Any shows? Do you guys have shows coming up?

1237
01:14:06,640 --> 01:14:09,640
Yes, but I don't remember when or where.

1238
01:14:09,640 --> 01:14:12,640
That's fine. Just check Caleb's social media.

1239
01:14:12,640 --> 01:14:15,640
Either you're going to see a show plug or you're going to see some funny ass shit.

1240
01:14:15,640 --> 01:14:17,640
I'm somewhere in Florida.

1241
01:14:17,640 --> 01:14:21,640
I guess we should just plug all of our social medias individually.

1242
01:14:21,640 --> 01:14:23,640
I don't think so.

1243
01:14:23,640 --> 01:14:29,080
it's 1997 is my new to Instagram. That's not true. That's mine. I guess you're

1244
01:14:29,080 --> 01:14:33,600
fuck it. Shit man. Fuck you subscribe to the Patreon. I think I did a whole

1245
01:14:33,600 --> 01:14:36,920
that's not my last time, but guys at this year, it's going to pop off. It's

1246
01:14:36,920 --> 01:14:39,480
incredible. There's an incredible backlog. We got moving Mondays on there.

1247
01:14:39,480 --> 01:14:42,320
We got beers. We drank is back. I predicted that it would not come back,

1248
01:14:42,320 --> 01:14:43,320
but it has come back and

1249
01:14:43,320 --> 01:14:49,200
Patrick said he's going to do something. I recorded something new. New DND

1250
01:14:49,200 --> 01:14:53,080
campaign has just started as of Monday. It's a door back to the fantasy DND

1251
01:14:53,080 --> 01:14:54,680
Trebuchet votes on the $10 tier.

1252
01:14:54,680 --> 01:14:56,480
And the shareholders meeting will be this month as well,

1253
01:14:56,480 --> 01:14:57,180
that we didn't pick a date.

1254
01:14:57,180 --> 01:14:58,980
Do we want to pick a date right now, this very second?

1255
01:14:58,980 --> 01:15:02,180
We will pick a date and it will be January.

1256
01:15:02,180 --> 01:15:04,280
Don't say a date right now.

1257
01:15:04,280 --> 01:15:05,280
I don't say a date right now.

1258
01:15:05,280 --> 01:15:05,780
The.

1259
01:15:05,780 --> 01:15:06,780
I have to figure out when I'm actually going to do it.

1260
01:15:06,780 --> 01:15:07,780
January the.

1261
01:15:07,780 --> 01:15:08,980
All right.

1262
01:15:08,980 --> 01:15:11,380
Well, I think that's that's really all we got.

1263
01:15:11,380 --> 01:15:12,680
Thanks, everybody.

1264
01:15:12,680 --> 01:15:13,480
Happy technology.

1265
01:15:13,480 --> 01:15:15,180
That is one more thing to say.

1266
01:15:15,180 --> 01:15:18,180
And follow @Nibirutruth on Instagram.

1267
01:15:18,180 --> 01:15:21,260
*heavy breathing*

1268
01:15:21,260 --> 01:15:21,760
*boing*

1269
01:15:21,760 --> 01:15:25,320
*static*

1270
01:15:25,320 --> 01:15:28,260
If you were- if you existed back in the Neolithic times,

1271
01:15:28,260 --> 01:15:31,620
they would cast you out of the community and you would be eaten by a panther.

1272
01:15:31,620 --> 01:15:33,540
Because you would need to learn to think like the group.

1273
01:15:33,540 --> 01:15:36,960
Conformity is how you survive. It's part of human evolution.

1274
01:15:36,960 --> 01:15:39,040
And then there would never have been crust on pizza if I invented it,

1275
01:15:39,040 --> 01:15:40,240
so then it would be the best food ever.

1276
01:15:40,240 --> 01:15:42,980
They only had crust back then. They didn't invent the pizza part yet.

1277
01:15:42,980 --> 01:15:44,540
It was just circles of crust.

1278
01:15:44,540 --> 01:15:46,540
They had the wheel, they said "let's make this out of bread."

1279
01:15:46,540 --> 01:15:48,860
They mostly had crust.

1280
01:15:48,860 --> 01:15:50,380
And crust comes from the earth.

1281
01:15:50,380 --> 01:15:54,140
It comes from the grains, and they smash them up so that you can bake it with water.

1282
01:15:54,140 --> 01:15:56,940
Exactly. Crust comes from the earth. Cheese does not come from the earth.

1283
01:15:56,940 --> 01:16:00,620
Have you guys ever noticed how crust is wheel shaped and cheese comes in a wheel shape,

1284
01:16:00,620 --> 01:16:02,900
but the sauce doesn't? What's up with that?

1285
01:16:02,900 --> 01:16:05,660
Sauce comes in a wheel shape. Tomato is a wheel shape.

1286
01:16:05,660 --> 01:16:07,140
Tomato is a wheel shape.

1287
01:16:07,140 --> 01:16:09,820
Tomato is a wheel shape and so is the tomato sauce can.

1288
01:16:09,820 --> 01:16:12,460
And pepperonis, too.

1289
01:16:12,460 --> 01:16:14,780
And so is the can that the tomato sauce is in.

1290
01:16:14,780 --> 01:16:16,780
Will you guys let Caleb talk?

1291
01:16:16,780 --> 01:16:18,780
I just want to make a point. I'm not raising my hand.

1292
01:16:18,780 --> 01:16:20,780
Oh, you can't even see it.

1293
01:16:20,780 --> 01:16:22,780
Can I just drop it? Hold on.

1294
01:16:22,780 --> 01:16:24,780
Do you see this tiny little o-ring, Charles?

1295
01:16:24,780 --> 01:16:26,780
I want to talk to you about food waste.

1296
01:16:26,780 --> 01:16:28,780
Do you see this?

1297
01:16:28,780 --> 01:16:30,780
No, I don't.

1298
01:16:30,780 --> 01:16:32,780
This is the size of a pizza

1299
01:16:32,780 --> 01:16:34,780
in Africa.

1300
01:16:34,780 --> 01:16:36,780
And this can feed 30 families

1301
01:16:36,780 --> 01:16:38,780
for 30 nights.

1302
01:16:38,780 --> 01:16:40,780
And you're throwing away probably 50 of these

1303
01:16:40,780 --> 01:16:42,780
a worth of crust

1304
01:16:42,780 --> 01:16:44,780
Every single time that you don't need to go.

1305
01:16:44,780 --> 01:16:46,780
I'll ship my crust to them.

1306
01:16:46,780 --> 01:16:48,780
To Africa? That's insulting.

1307
01:16:48,780 --> 01:16:50,780
So now you're insulting Africa.

1308
01:16:50,780 --> 01:16:52,780
Ship your shit to Africa?

1309
01:16:52,780 --> 01:16:54,780
Ship your shit to Africa?

1310
01:16:54,780 --> 01:16:56,780
That's not even legal.

1311
01:16:56,780 --> 01:16:58,780
That's not okay.

1312
01:16:58,780 --> 01:17:00,780
Imagine you're a starving African child.

1313
01:17:00,780 --> 01:17:02,780
You said, Caleb said that there are people starving in Africa.

1314
01:17:02,780 --> 01:17:04,780
You said, okay, I'll send them my shit?

1315
01:17:04,780 --> 01:17:06,780
Yeah, crust.

1316
01:17:06,780 --> 01:17:08,780
I meant crust.

1317
01:17:08,780 --> 01:17:10,780
Imagine the crust he's eating.

1318
01:17:10,780 --> 01:17:13,780
Not even the whole shit? Just the crust of it?

1319
01:17:13,780 --> 01:17:16,780
No, just the pizza crust. You guys are so juvenile and immature on this show.

1320
01:17:16,780 --> 01:17:22,780
You want to insult a starving African child, the stendid belly, who opens up the only thing they've ever...

1321
01:17:22,780 --> 01:17:27,780
the only package of mail they've ever had, they open it up, it's not only your shit, it's just part of it?

1322
01:17:27,780 --> 01:17:29,780
They can tell it's scooped out.

1323
01:17:29,780 --> 01:17:31,780
This is... I've been so misrepresented here.

1324
01:17:31,780 --> 01:17:34,780
And also, like, your shit's gonna be crazy 'cause you don't eat the...

1325
01:17:34,780 --> 01:17:39,780
all you're eating is cheese and pepperonis. Your shit's gonna be all... it's gonna be liquid when they get there.

1326
01:17:39,780 --> 01:17:40,780
when they get there.

1327
01:17:40,780 --> 01:17:42,820
