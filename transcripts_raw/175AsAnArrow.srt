1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,580
(upbeat music)

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:11,000
- You take that back, I am not in my flop era.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,120
- He is in his flop era.

4
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:12,960
- I think he is.

5
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:13,800
- I am not in my flop era.

6
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:15,680
- Patrick is in his flop era.

7
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:17,000
- Two things I realized this week.

8
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,040
Number one, Patrick clearly in his flop era.

9
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:21,760
The history records will show.

10
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:22,600
- The flopster.

11
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:24,000
- This is him flopping.

12
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:24,840
2023 is his flop era.

13
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:26,480
- You're the flopster, you're floppy bro.

14
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:27,760
- I'm not floppy.

15
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:28,960
I'm not floppy bird.

16
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:36,920
I'm not I don't wake up. I don't wait up and eat flop jacks. I don't do that. You know, I don't have a flop

17
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:39,400
Pacino you do uh-uh you do you eat?

18
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:44,520
You do eat food. I don't eat flop suey and you eat flop

19
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:47,240
I don't even

20
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:49,800
flop deliver

21
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:53,440
Fleas

22
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:56,160
Yeah, I don't have a flop fleas at the flop

23
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:58,800
And you guys got arrested by the flops.

24
00:00:58,800 --> 00:00:59,800
I did not get arrested by the flops.

25
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:00,800
For being in your flop era?

26
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:01,800
Uh-uh.

27
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:02,800
Number two thing.

28
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:06,320
They said, "Sir, please stand right here and flop in a straight line."

29
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:09,720
You said, "Certainly, officer."

30
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:11,560
I wasn't gone up the soda flop.

31
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:12,560
You were.

32
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:13,960
You were completely gone off a soda flop.

33
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:14,960
Nope.

34
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:15,960
Lolli flop.

35
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:18,240
I did not have a lolli flop.

36
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:19,240
Yeah.

37
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:20,240
Or a flopsicle.

38
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:21,240
You had a flopsicle.

39
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:22,240
I did not have a flopsicle.

40
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:23,240
Actually, you didn't have one.

41
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:24,240
You invented one.

42
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:25,240
I did not invent a flopsicle.

43
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:26,240
I'm not a flopper.

44
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:27,240
I'm not a flopper.

45
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:28,240
Yeah, you are.

46
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:29,240
You are a complete flopper.

47
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:30,240
The number two thing that I realized is that I...

48
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:31,240
The number two thing that I realized is that I...

49
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:32,240
The number two.

50
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:33,240
It's okay to be...

51
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:34,240
It's okay to be tired and mentally...

52
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:35,240
Okay, America's flop model.

53
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:36,240
America's flop model.

54
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:37,240
I think half of his face is about to flop.

55
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:38,240
Damn.

56
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:39,240
He can't speak.

57
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:40,240
He's gonna have a stroke.

58
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:41,240
A stroke?

59
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:42,240
Stroke.

60
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:44,560
He's post-flop and pre-flop.

61
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:45,560
You're pre-flop.

62
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:46,560
And he's flopping right now.

63
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:48,120
You're about to flop so hard.

64
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:49,720
He is flopping.

65
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:50,720
You're flopping right now.

66
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:51,720
I'm not flopping.

67
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:56,040
you're saying is a complete flop, a bomb. You're bombing, you're flopping.

68
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:58,680
No. You're flopping. I'm not flopping.

69
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:05,600
Number two thing I realized. I am Patrick's ultimate idol and hero. I realized that recently.

70
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:08,840
He's been patterning for two years now. Can I say something? He's been patterning everything

71
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:14,960
after me. He wants to be me. I'm his idol. I'm his hero. Every single time I talk to

72
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:20,800
him, he is dropping subtle hints that he is looking up at me. He looks up to me, basically,

73
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:25,120
is what I'm saying. And I'm his hero, I'm his idol. And I just want to say that publicly.

74
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:29,320
So next time if you ever see me and him doing something similar, I always did it first and

75
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:31,120
I'm his idol so he's copying me.

76
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:32,120
I'm not copying.

77
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:33,120
You are.

78
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:34,120
I'm not even floppy.

79
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:37,800
And he also just got a song in the flop music flop 40.

80
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:40,560
Oh he did, yeah.

81
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:41,560
And it wasn't Lolliflop.

82
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:46,160
It was Lolliflop by you and two clones.

83
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:47,160
Two clones of me?

84
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:48,160
Yeah.

85
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:49,160
It was not.

86
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:54,600
Was not lolliflop. What would you say over if you if you looked at your lives?

87
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:57,200
Like she flop it like a lolliflop

88
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:03,820
If you see shorty wanna fly off. He's even flopping right now. He's bombing

89
00:03:03,820 --> 00:03:18,400
Well you just need to stop flopping good, I don't flop that much anymore you've got a bomb on us you flopped a bomb

90
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,660
(laughing)

91
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:22,800
♪ You flopped a bomb on me ♪

92
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:25,960
♪ Oh you flopped a bomb, Pat ♪

93
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:26,800
- You don't know the words.

94
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:27,880
- Put that away.

95
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:29,120
- I'm not putting it away.

96
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:31,680
I have to, I drank all the cold brew

97
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:33,600
and my girlfriend's mad at me.

98
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:34,840
- That was a flop for her.

99
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:35,680
- That was a flop for her, yeah.

100
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:37,120
- Okay, smooth flopperator.

101
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:39,840
- I just got into Sade.

102
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:41,760
- Really?

103
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:42,580
- I really just did.

104
00:03:42,580 --> 00:03:43,960
- An interesting thing to do late in life,

105
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:45,040
kind of a flop.

106
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:45,880
- Late in life.

107
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:47,680
(laughing)

108
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:48,680
I don't have much time left.

109
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:49,680
Late in life.

110
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:52,480
Yeah, what are you guys going to do in your sundown years?

111
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:53,480
Next year?

112
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:55,480
Yeah, now that we're getting into those.

113
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:56,480
Inventor, magician.

114
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:57,480
That's pretty good.

115
00:03:57,480 --> 00:03:59,480
I'm running towards 30.

116
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:00,480
Forest.

117
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:01,480
I'm scared.

118
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:03,480
Literally, I'm not going to see 31.

119
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:04,480
Why?

120
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:10,480
You're going to flop too hard one day?

121
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:11,480
Maybe.

122
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:12,480
Splatter when you hit the toilet?

123
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:13,480
Maybe.

124
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:21,860
I think I told my ex-girlfriend one time, I was like, "If I'm not successful by the time

125
00:04:21,860 --> 00:04:23,860
I'm 28, I think I'm done."

126
00:04:23,860 --> 00:04:24,860
Kill.

127
00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:25,860
I'm just going to ...

128
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:28,740
Me and Cam used to talk about that all the time in college.

129
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:29,740
We were always like, "Yeah."

130
00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:31,500
At 28, if you're not doing anything by the 28th ...

131
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:33,180
I think ours was earlier than 28.

132
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:34,180
I think, yeah.

133
00:04:34,180 --> 00:04:39,620
I remember Cam said, "Yeah, I think what I'll do is I'll give myself one year to have anything

134
00:04:39,620 --> 00:04:43,980
cool happened to me after college and then if it doesn't happen then I'll work at McDonald's

135
00:04:43,980 --> 00:04:51,280
and then when I turn 24 I'll kill myself and I was in a pretty bad enough place that I

136
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:54,620
heard that and instead of being like whoa I was like it's actually a pretty good plan.

137
00:04:54,620 --> 00:04:57,020
Yeah I guess that makes sense.

138
00:04:57,020 --> 00:04:59,700
Yeah and luckily for me COVID hit.

139
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:01,700
Yeah and then something very cool happened.

140
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:02,700
Something very incredible happened.

141
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:03,700
Half the population died.

142
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:04,700
Yep.

143
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:05,700
Well you got to imagine.

144
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:06,700
Dude.

145
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:07,700
Do you realize?

146
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:10,100
in the Marvel universe, we would be profiting

147
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:12,240
so fucking hard off the Thanos.

148
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:14,080
- Oh my god, are you kidding me?

149
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:16,600
- Can you imagine how many, if we all survived,

150
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:19,280
how many people who are better than us at this

151
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:20,560
would have just been dead?

152
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:24,120
- Can you imagine though, if like two of us lived

153
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:28,160
and one of us died, the sympathy tour

154
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:30,080
that we could put together.

155
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:32,840
Oh my god, we would be no other, nobody could pack up.

156
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:34,400
Every venue's at half capacity.

157
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:36,040
- He dies at the gym or something,

158
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:38,400
because you let a weight crush his neck.

159
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:39,440
- Well no, I'm still talking about--

160
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:40,280
- Oh, the snap?

161
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:41,960
Oh, there you're talking about normal life.

162
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:44,160
- Flop, F-L-O-P, that spells flop.

163
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:45,000
- Nope.

164
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,280
Did not flop.

165
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:49,560
- Flop, flop, flop.

166
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:50,680
- Floptastic four.

167
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:56,560
- Anyway, so yeah, when, who's going to die,

168
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:58,200
eeny, meeny, miny--

169
00:05:58,200 --> 00:05:59,320
- He's gonna die at the gym.

170
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:00,800
- Let's flip a coin.

171
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:03,240
- A three-way coin. - A three-way coin.

172
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:04,080
- Okay.

173
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:04,920
(laughing)

174
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:09,680
Let's do it. A three-way coin. Flip a three-way coin. Google that.

175
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:10,680
Oh my God, that was...

176
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:11,680
Work on that in the meantime.

177
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:12,680
That was already a result.

178
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:13,680
There we go. Roll a three-sided.

179
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:17,800
So who's one, two, three?

180
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:18,800
I'm number two.

181
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:20,560
I'll be number one if I have to.

182
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:22,080
What? I should have been number one.

183
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:23,080
I guess I'm three.

184
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:24,080
All right, ready?

185
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:28,400
The result was... it's two. It says roll number one, two right there.

186
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:29,960
Well, you need to roll it.

187
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:31,640
Okay, this thing doesn't work.

188
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:34,120
You're just re-rolling it a bunch. All right, this is nothing.

189
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:39,720
You're flopping. You're flopping and you're a ruiner.

190
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:43,920
It was two, so I die first. So when I die, not going to be the gym by the way.

191
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:45,920
It's going to be in the Piranhas or something.

192
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:46,920
No, Glory Hole.

193
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:47,920
It could be Piranhas at the gym.

194
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:52,120
Glory Hole at the gym? What gym do you go to that has a Glory Hole? Equinox?

195
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:53,120
Yeah.

196
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:57,120
Planet Flopness.

197
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:02,120
It's nothing. It's completely nothing.

198
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:03,120
Flops Gym.

199
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:09,120
Yeah, what's your what laundromat to go to the flopping laundromat? Yeah, yeah, you do

200
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:14,120
go there though. But when I die, and like I said, it doesn't really matter how I die,

201
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:19,120
a beautiful woman will be involved in some way, maybe murder suicide. But if I die, what

202
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:22,120
do you guys beautiful woman will be involved because she's gonna say you did something

203
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:27,120
and you're gonna kill yourself? No, kill her. No, I'll kill her. I'll kill her. I'll kill

204
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:32,120
her. I'll kill her. I'll kill her. I'll kill her. I'll kill her. I'll kill her. I'll kill

205
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:37,640
No, I'll kill her first I kill her and then I kill myself

206
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:44,880
He laughs at his own flops how embarrassing is that his own flops

207
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:49,560
He's laughing because your face got red no yeah

208
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:53,960
Laughing no blood vessels flopped yeah

209
00:07:53,960 --> 00:08:00,400
Anyway when I die and you guys go out on the new tour yeah the Caleb death

210
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:02,400
It's called the Caleb's Bones Tour.

211
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:03,400
And you show my bones?

212
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:04,400
We have a, we do.

213
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:05,400
Like the Dead Sea Scrolls?

214
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:06,400
Oh yeah, we do like a road show.

215
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:10,400
We do, we have a little like, uh, we have a little like, like podcast about this museum.

216
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:13,400
It's in a trailer that we pull around to the back of the venue.

217
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:14,400
We keep putting like, pretty good idea.

218
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:16,400
We get a VIP ticket, you know, and a touch kit with bones.

219
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:18,400
We keep putting like alligator bones in it too.

220
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:20,400
Yeah, replacing all Caleb's teeth.

221
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:25,400
It's like, it's like your normal body, with just an alligator skull.

222
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:28,400
Just every stop you replace one bone with an alligator bone.

223
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:31,840
by the end of it, it's just one big alligator and you're like, yeah, this is

224
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:32,680
our dead friend.

225
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:34,640
And we let everyone rub the bones for good luck.

226
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:38,080
I think my bones, I think my bones are bad luck.

227
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:40,200
Yeah. Your bones are yellow.

228
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:40,920
I wanted to find out.

229
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:42,160
I think I have yellow fucking bones.

230
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:44,640
You have yellow mummified bones in your body.

231
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:45,720
I got mummy bones, man.

232
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:47,040
Because you get sick all the time.

233
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:49,120
Do mummies don't have, mummies do have bones.

234
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:50,480
Mummies bones.

235
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:52,040
Do mummies don't have bones?

236
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:54,800
Mummies have bones.

237
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:57,880
Or I asked a question that I interrupted myself with the wrong answer, then I

238
00:08:57,880 --> 00:09:00,680
correct myself. Is it true that they take out the mummies brain through its nose?

239
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:05,220
Yeah, well they used to. Talk about a booger. I don't think they make mummies anymore. Talk about a booger for real.

240
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:07,680
They had to use a hook. They have like a...

241
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:11,100
You can try. Yeah, do we have a hook?

242
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:16,120
Yeah, I don't think we have a hook. We have an exact mummification stuff.

243
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:19,840
So they go and they go all the way up. Yeah, and they go like this.

244
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:24,800
And they spin it around in the person's brain. Yeah, and they pull it out through their nose.

245
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:29,060
I don't think my brain I don't mean to brag. I don't think my brain would fit through my nose

246
00:09:29,060 --> 00:09:34,380
No, it would I'm sure they're not getting the whole thing. I mean, it's what like it's it's BC get it in chunks

247
00:09:34,380 --> 00:09:38,580
Well, but I don't think they were you put her back then so they had tiny brain. Yeah, that's true tiner brains

248
00:09:38,580 --> 00:09:42,180
I I would love to go back in time to mummy times and

249
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:50,620
Help them out by just just perfect head shots. Yeah, just go back with a big Barrett 50-caliber shooting all the mummies

250
00:09:50,620 --> 00:09:51,620
- You know what I would do?

251
00:09:51,620 --> 00:09:52,620
I would go back, I would--

252
00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:53,620
- I thought you meant, "Ch-ch-ch."

253
00:09:53,620 --> 00:09:54,620
- No, I would go back--

254
00:09:54,620 --> 00:09:55,620
- That too, actually, change their lives.

255
00:09:55,620 --> 00:09:56,620
- That's an even better idea.

256
00:09:56,620 --> 00:09:57,620
I'd go back there with a Canon 7D.

257
00:09:57,620 --> 00:09:58,620
- Yeah, yeah.

258
00:09:58,620 --> 00:09:59,620
- I'm taking photos of them, I'm like,

259
00:09:59,620 --> 00:10:00,620
"You are a natural beauty."

260
00:10:00,620 --> 00:10:01,620
- Work it.

261
00:10:01,620 --> 00:10:02,620
- I'd walk in there, I'd walk into the embalming room,

262
00:10:02,620 --> 00:10:03,620
and I'd be like, and I'd see them, you know,

263
00:10:03,620 --> 00:10:04,620
trying to pull out little pieces of brain with the hook,

264
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:05,620
and I'd be like, "No, no, no, step back,

265
00:10:05,620 --> 00:10:06,620
"let me show you how it's done."

266
00:10:06,620 --> 00:10:07,620
And I'd open the mummy's mouth,

267
00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:10,320
I'd pull out little pieces of brain with the hook,

268
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:11,680
and I'd be like, "No, no, no, no, step back.

269
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:12,780
"Let me show you how it's done."

270
00:10:12,780 --> 00:10:13,820
And it'd open the mummy's mouth,

271
00:10:13,820 --> 00:10:16,580
and I'd put my mouth on the mummy's mouth, open,

272
00:10:16,580 --> 00:10:18,460
and I'd just go (blows air)

273
00:10:18,460 --> 00:10:20,540
I'd suck a whole brain out.

274
00:10:20,540 --> 00:10:21,680
- You have an oyster in your mouth

275
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:24,140
so you can trick them into thinking that you're like God.

276
00:10:24,140 --> 00:10:25,740
- I'll take all their brains out with my suction.

277
00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:27,340
- I had an oyster the other day,

278
00:10:27,340 --> 00:10:29,220
and I told the people that I was with that I liked it,

279
00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:30,460
but I really did not like it.

280
00:10:30,460 --> 00:10:31,300
- You don't like oysters?

281
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:32,900
- I'm not too big a fan of oysters.

282
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:34,140
- It's a booger. - I love oysters.

283
00:10:34,140 --> 00:10:34,980
- That is a booger.

284
00:10:35,980 --> 00:10:37,980
You

285
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:40,020
Then that would make sense yeah

286
00:10:40,020 --> 00:10:44,940
Texture of a booger then you would like oysters. I never really got the taste for an oyster

287
00:10:44,940 --> 00:10:48,540
I feel like I would if I kept going, but I don't really doesn't understand

288
00:10:48,540 --> 00:10:56,380
Why do I want a cold boo first of all the best thing about boogers? I understand. I understand aphrodisiacs you I mean more than anybody

289
00:10:56,380 --> 00:11:01,080
You are I yes

290
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:04,500
You are the ultimate

291
00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:06,020
Idol

292
00:11:06,020 --> 00:11:10,080
That's what you will die first because you'll probably die from fucking yeah

293
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:12,620
I'll probably let a three

294
00:11:12,620 --> 00:11:14,740
fucking falling down an elevator shaft

295
00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:20,660
See and that's it. That's kind of charm that will attract a harem of women to you

296
00:11:20,660 --> 00:11:25,460
Yeah, it's disgusting what Cameron does on the weekends. I will say you know what he does

297
00:11:25,460 --> 00:11:28,740
He's like doing some Thomas. It'll be a

298
00:11:28,740 --> 00:11:33,020
Stuff yeah, he's doing Thomas middle greasy case if he goes to the goth

299
00:11:33,540 --> 00:11:39,040
sex club. I eat for lunch. And then I go to the goth sex club. I load up on Mexican. I

300
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:44,540
load up on cards. Waffle from the waffle maker, greasy ass quesadilla, olives. And then hit

301
00:11:44,540 --> 00:11:51,540
the sex club. No shower, no toothbrush. Then I go to the goth sex club. Milk shake in a

302
00:11:51,540 --> 00:12:01,680
Gatorade bottle. Paint a bullseye on my asshole. I'm walking into that sex club, shaking up

303
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:06,640
the Gatorade bottle. Grease my hair back with Crisco. Yeah. And if I'm losing my energy's

304
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:10,720
flagging I'm rubbing my hands through my hair like I'm fixing it and I'm going. Just misunderstanding

305
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:16,680
what goth is to the point where you're just making yourself a disgusting trash monster.

306
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:22,200
I cover myself in. I burn a cork and I put it all over my face. I put all the ash on

307
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:26,600
my face so I look like a hobo. And I'm walking around sticking bindle, guess what's in that

308
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:30,880
stick and bindle. Creamed corn, just in the bag.

309
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:31,880
Just dripping everywhere?

310
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:32,880
Plastic bag.

311
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:34,880
Plastic bag on the end of a twig.

312
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:36,880
Do you guys think that...

313
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:40,880
On a twig that's long enough for me to put over my shoulder.

314
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:45,880
When we get older and all of our girlfriends and wives die...

315
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:47,880
Yeah, because they're dying first.

316
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:49,880
Because they'll die first. We pick them for that.

317
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:51,880
I'm sorry baby, but you're not going to outlive me.

318
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:53,880
You're done. Can we agree...

319
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:57,240
gonna die and then it's gonna make me really good at woodworking.

320
00:12:57,240 --> 00:12:58,840
You're not gonna be a wood...

321
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:03,220
No, no, no, no. Something's gonna snap in my brain that turns me into just like a

322
00:13:03,220 --> 00:13:03,680
stoic.

323
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:05,200
You're gonna think you're really good at woodworking.

324
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:09,040
Yeah, and you're just gonna bring out the worst tables ever, the worst shit of

325
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:09,360
all time.

326
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:09,560
I made a pencil.

327
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:13,040
On a lathe, you're making a single pencil?

328
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:16,720
There's no graphite in it at all. Yeah, it's just wood.

329
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:17,920
Check this out.

330
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:19,920
This is my new business, Pat's Pencils.

331
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:21,080
Pat's Pencils is good.

332
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:26,640
But I think I'd become a Houdini style escape artist,

333
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:28,160
but I would die on the first attempt.

334
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:28,960
As a widower?

335
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:29,760
Yeah.

336
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:33,240
I'd get into my armoire, because I'm older.

337
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:34,200
I can afford an armoire.

338
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:36,680
Straight up, I'd be so depressed as fuck

339
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:38,600
if my girlfriend ever died.

340
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:40,920
I would be sad at first, and then I'd go out and party.

341
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:44,160
[LAUGHTER]

342
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:45,680
I heard that.

343
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:46,480
Heard that.

344
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:49,600
Yeah, I would be sad for a couple of weeks,

345
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:51,720
and then I would basically be on a carnival cruise.

346
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:56,600
I've been doing back to back carnival cruises to get over it.

347
00:13:56,600 --> 00:14:00,040
Right. Like, I don't know. The sea is calling me.

348
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:06,680
Meanwhile, I'm on a cruise boat that has a water slide on it and I'm pushing the

349
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:09,200
kids out of the way. I'm doing the water slide over and over and over.

350
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:11,800
And if a parent comes over and is like, what the fuck is wrong with you?

351
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:15,280
You have like, I have a death certificate from my girlfriend. I hold up.

352
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:18,200
I say, look at this. Next to a photo of her in a locket.

353
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:19,720
Yeah. Guys, I have a movie idea.

354
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:22,280
Okay. It's a A24 movie.

355
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:23,760
So I don't want to hear this.

356
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:25,320
Wait, no. So that's how you know.

357
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:25,840
Blah, blah, blah, blah.

358
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:26,720
That's how you know it's good.

359
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:27,120
Oh, right.

360
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:30,160
It's an A24 movie and it's about a guy.

361
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:32,400
And he's sold.

362
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:35,480
I'm sold already.

363
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:36,960
This is pretty good.

364
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:38,200
His wife dies.

365
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:39,680
He's in his late 40s.

366
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:40,560
Now you're losing me.

367
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:41,720
Or his very late 40s.

368
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:42,760
Maybe he's 49.

369
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:43,960
So like, so 60s.

370
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:44,920
No, he's 49.

371
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:47,560
Maybe he's even early 50s or mid early 50s.

372
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:48,800
51 to 52 to 53.

373
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:49,480
65.

374
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:55,180
So he's wife dies or I guess it's an A24 movie, his husband dies.

375
00:14:55,180 --> 00:14:57,180
And then he is sitting on...

376
00:14:57,180 --> 00:15:00,180
Okay, so already we're kind of leaning on the bury your gays trope.

377
00:15:00,180 --> 00:15:02,180
Just getting the gay characters out of the way by killing them.

378
00:15:02,180 --> 00:15:04,180
Do you want to get buried gay guys?

379
00:15:04,180 --> 00:15:06,180
Because maybe you should stop interrupting me.

380
00:15:06,180 --> 00:15:08,180
Flopper interrupter.

381
00:15:08,180 --> 00:15:11,180
My TV tropes page is going to be a mile long and I don't give a fuck.

382
00:15:11,180 --> 00:15:17,180
Listen, so his name is... who cares?

383
00:15:17,180 --> 00:15:20,820
That's not his name. But he has a name, but it doesn't matter. He has a name,

384
00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:20,980
though.

385
00:15:20,980 --> 00:15:21,500
Scott.

386
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:23,220
Scott. Something like that.

387
00:15:23,220 --> 00:15:24,340
See, that's why you need us here.

388
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:29,700
His husband dies, and then he's sitting on the couch, and he's flipping through

389
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:34,020
the channels, right? And he's watching ESPN. Well, no, he's watching ESPN2.

390
00:15:34,020 --> 00:15:36,780
Logo. He's watching the Logo channel.

391
00:15:36,780 --> 00:15:41,860
Commercials come, right? And he sees a commercial for Sandals Resorts, right?

392
00:15:41,860 --> 00:15:42,260
Okay.

393
00:15:42,260 --> 00:15:46,580
And he sees the family, and they're playing, and then he books a flight, and

394
00:15:46,580 --> 00:15:48,780
and then it's like an hour and a half of him

395
00:15:48,780 --> 00:15:50,120
basically doing like,

396
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:52,880
there's a movie that's like that,

397
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:55,100
but he's just like walking around sandals.

398
00:15:55,100 --> 00:15:56,620
Yes, but he's just having the time of his life.

399
00:15:56,620 --> 00:15:57,460
He completely gets over his husband.

400
00:15:57,460 --> 00:15:59,020
- I bet it's called "Mandels"

401
00:15:59,020 --> 00:16:00,380
'cause it's for only gay men.

402
00:16:00,380 --> 00:16:01,940
- Why does it have to be,

403
00:16:01,940 --> 00:16:03,060
the nice thing about,

404
00:16:03,060 --> 00:16:04,060
here's what I like in movies,

405
00:16:04,060 --> 00:16:06,440
I like gay stuff enough,

406
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:08,980
but I don't want it to be the whole movie's gay.

407
00:16:08,980 --> 00:16:11,620
It should be like, oh, yeah, we know he's gay,

408
00:16:11,620 --> 00:16:12,660
but he doesn't ever,

409
00:16:12,660 --> 00:16:14,500
there's no guys in it,

410
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:15,340
and he never has sex with a guy.

411
00:16:15,340 --> 00:16:19,260
It should be it should be something like like they're just kind of yeah

412
00:16:19,260 --> 00:16:24,900
Yeah, and you're like, okay I can check that I'm a good guy cuz I didn't turn

413
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:31,600
But I don't want to see they don't they don't like show they just show one scene in the wood nor completely like normal movie

414
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:35,060
Yeah, just like a guy maybe it's like I don't know like an action movie or something

415
00:16:35,060 --> 00:16:40,660
And then there's one scene where he's like on he's like driving his car and then he looks at it like he gets the grinder

416
00:16:40,660 --> 00:16:42,900
Notification sound he looks at his

417
00:16:44,780 --> 00:16:45,780
Yeah, okay.

418
00:16:45,780 --> 00:16:47,780
He looks over and goes...

419
00:16:47,780 --> 00:16:53,160
And the lead, and Scott is played by Jim Norton, I think, would be a really good kind of twist

420
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:54,160
for that.

421
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:55,160
Yeah.

422
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:56,160
Yeah.

423
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:57,160
All right.

424
00:16:57,160 --> 00:16:58,160
That's your movie?

425
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:03,420
I just like the idea of a movie where a guy gets over his dead spouse by just going on

426
00:17:03,420 --> 00:17:04,420
vacation.

427
00:17:04,420 --> 00:17:05,420
Yeah.

428
00:17:05,420 --> 00:17:06,420
And it's just like instantly solved pretty much.

429
00:17:06,420 --> 00:17:07,420
And he doesn't meet...

430
00:17:07,420 --> 00:17:08,420
No, he's not interested.

431
00:17:08,420 --> 00:17:12,020
Maybe people come on to him and he's like, "What the fuck are you talking about?"

432
00:17:12,020 --> 00:17:13,020
I'm not gay.

433
00:17:13,020 --> 00:17:15,660
I mean, I'm gay.

434
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:18,700
I feel like this is a good concept, this is a good starting point for the concept for

435
00:17:18,700 --> 00:17:19,700
a first movie.

436
00:17:19,700 --> 00:17:23,900
I feel like then, you know, we can build a franchise out of this, movies two, three,

437
00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:28,320
four, etc. and we don't even have to worry about the origin story, it just is on vacation

438
00:17:28,320 --> 00:17:29,320
in the other movies.

439
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:31,340
We don't have to remember the gay stuff or the death or whatever.

440
00:17:31,340 --> 00:17:32,340
Vacation, Scott's vacation.

441
00:17:32,340 --> 00:17:34,140
Scott's no family vacation.

442
00:17:34,140 --> 00:17:36,620
It's like Alien to Aliens, you know, it changes genres.

443
00:17:36,620 --> 00:17:39,620
I just had an idea, you know how there's movies, you know how there's a couple of movies where

444
00:17:39,620 --> 00:17:40,460
- He goes on a bunch of vacations.

445
00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:42,820
- He goes on a bunch of vacations in the second one.

446
00:17:42,820 --> 00:17:44,060
And it's more of an action vibe.

447
00:17:44,060 --> 00:17:46,020
- You know how there's movies where people,

448
00:17:46,020 --> 00:17:47,560
where this happens a lot also in life,

449
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:50,220
where somebody is in a straight relationship

450
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:51,300
and they have kids and stuff,

451
00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:53,120
and then their spouse dies,

452
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:53,960
and like, what's that movie, Beginners?

453
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:55,260
- And they start lizin' it up.

454
00:17:55,260 --> 00:17:57,700
- Yeah, they were gay the whole time,

455
00:17:57,700 --> 00:17:59,500
and they're like, "Oh, finally I can be free."

456
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:01,180
But like, it's complicated.

457
00:18:01,180 --> 00:18:02,820
- Michael Jackson thriller ending.

458
00:18:02,820 --> 00:18:03,660
- Why is there not--

459
00:18:03,660 --> 00:18:04,500
- That's true.

460
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:07,300
(laughing)

461
00:18:07,300 --> 00:18:08,140
- Turning around.

462
00:18:08,140 --> 00:18:10,380
(laughing)

463
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:15,620
- That's funny.

464
00:18:15,620 --> 00:18:18,900
Why is there no movie where a guy pretended to be gay

465
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:20,780
his entire life and then his husband dies

466
00:18:20,780 --> 00:18:21,740
and he's like, "Oh my God, I'm fine."

467
00:18:21,740 --> 00:18:23,380
- I now pronounce you Chuck and Larry.

468
00:18:23,380 --> 00:18:25,200
- That is not that.

469
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:26,260
- It's close enough.

470
00:18:26,260 --> 00:18:27,100
- No, but I mean like--

471
00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:28,020
- It's the closest we have.

472
00:18:28,020 --> 00:18:30,980
- What if you had a high school boyfriend,

473
00:18:30,980 --> 00:18:33,100
but you just, maybe as a joke,

474
00:18:33,100 --> 00:18:35,220
somebody pranked you to that.

475
00:18:35,220 --> 00:18:36,100
- Yeah, it was an accident.

476
00:18:36,100 --> 00:18:39,600
and then 40 year marriage is just let's not even get into the specifics for

477
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:41,500
whatever reason. It was just an accident. It was just some kind of accident.

478
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:45,400
Some awful accident. Some confusing accident. But then 40 years later,

479
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:51,100
he dies and you finally are like, oh my God, I can be myself.

480
00:18:51,100 --> 00:18:55,700
Hooters, Dave and Busters. Yep. All that kind of shit. Playing hockey and all

481
00:18:55,700 --> 00:18:59,100
that. Oh, dude. Wouldn't that be cool? That'd be a cool movie. And it's like

482
00:18:59,100 --> 00:19:02,400
kind of like you're learning. Oh, and there could be a scene where like you,

483
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:06,020
he he like finds a girl and they start hooking up and he like

484
00:19:06,020 --> 00:19:10,560
and she's like,

485
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:13,040
sorry, I never learned.

486
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:15,480
My whole life.

487
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:16,440
No, sorry.

488
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:20,080
I was accidentally gay from the time I was 15 until a couple of days ago when my

489
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:20,920
husband died.

490
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:21,880
Yeah.

491
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:30,640
You know, I could see,

492
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:33,760
- I could see this movie, I think that if you just,

493
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:35,960
if you make the ending that he's like,

494
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:37,600
you know what, I actually am gay,

495
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:39,520
that movie could be made tomorrow.

496
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:40,360
- You think so?

497
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:41,560
- I think that that could be,

498
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:42,880
they would do that. - He realized that he wasn't,

499
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:44,040
that he was-- - He's like, okay,

500
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:45,880
maybe I'm gonna try it out.

501
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:48,360
I'm gonna try being straight, and it's a comedy about,

502
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:51,640
yeah, it's a comedy about how being straight is crazy.

503
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:53,380
- And it's called As an Arrow.

504
00:19:53,380 --> 00:19:55,640
- Oh. - Oh.

505
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:57,800
- That took me a second, but that's good.

506
00:19:57,800 --> 00:19:59,720
- And it only clicked for me.

507
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:06,200
it as a curved a twirling arrow. Oh my god this is so smart. As an arrow with a...

508
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:09,160
No he's wearing the arrow that goes through his head. That's like that.

509
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:15,040
Oh my god and he's in front of his husband's grave. And it's Steve Martin.

510
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:21,320
Yeah this is amazing because Steve Martin it looks older than he is.

511
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:23,320
Flop. Flop.

512
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:25,320
Pronunciation. Flop alert.

513
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:27,320
Pronunciation.

514
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:29,320
You should put a big alarm on the wall.

515
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:31,320
Flop alert.

516
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:33,320
I'm going to hit you.

517
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:35,320
You keep flopping like that.

518
00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:37,320
Okay?

519
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:39,320
I'm going to cut your pay.

520
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:41,320
I'm going to dock your pay.

521
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:43,320
Don't dock my pay. I have to buy more wicker furniture.

522
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:45,320
Flop.

523
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:47,320
I have to buy all this fucking wicker furniture.

524
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:49,320
It sucks living with girls.

525
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:56,320
moved in with my girlfriend. She bought all this wicker dresser, and as soon as I saw

526
00:20:56,320 --> 00:21:01,960
it, I was like, "Mo is going to climb the fuck out of that thing. That is not a good

527
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:06,880
idea." And she said, "Don't worry about it." This morning, I woke up to her screaming at

528
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:12,880
Mo to get down, and he's looking back. He's got his claws into the second dresser just

529
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:13,880
looking at her.

530
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:15,760
Full Spider-Man. That's the reason why at my house, all our

531
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:17,280
furniture is made of ice.

532
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:22,640
I wish, I hate wicker furniture so much I keep sitting down on it and I hear

533
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:26,480
and I'm like damn I'm getting heavy. I don't have any ice furniture all my

534
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:31,360
furniture is pewter. Pewter Schmidt, Carter Pewter Schmidt. It's actually computer furniture.

535
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:35,880
Richest fuck guy. What are you talking about? Carter Pewter Schmidt.

536
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:39,360
Don't know who that is. You have messed up his name I know that. Carter Pewter Schmidt.

537
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:42,480
There we go. Twice you just said his name wrong and I've never even heard that

538
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:46,120
that name and it was wrong. He said you know you know Carter

539
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:52,720
Peter Schmidt. No. Yeah, you do computer computer Schmidt.

540
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:57,680
Oh, that's part of the table. Carter Peter Schmidt from is it

541
00:21:57,680 --> 00:22:00,560
this guy? Doctor Heinz Doofenshmirtz is that what you're

542
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:04,080
thinking? I think that's what I'm trying to say. I don't ****

543
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:08,880
with him at all. No, he's a **** but I will like listen. You

544
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:11,040
doctor Doofenshmirtz. I don't **** with him and a lot of

545
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:13,580
people say that but I know what you assume about me when I say that and

546
00:22:13,580 --> 00:22:18,020
actually I don't much fuck with Perry the platypus either. I think that he's whack.

547
00:22:18,020 --> 00:22:23,280
I think they are both not so great. What the flip? And I am more on the side of me.

548
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:29,480
I don't have allegiances to other people. Yeah. I'm a lone wolf.

549
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:33,400
That's actually cool as fuck. And I would kill either of them if I was in the show.

550
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:38,700
I would kill either of maybe your two friends to get ahead. I would kill

551
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:40,260
- I would kill anybody to get a head.

552
00:22:40,260 --> 00:22:41,100
- Definitely.

553
00:22:41,100 --> 00:22:42,260
- Or anybody.

554
00:22:42,260 --> 00:22:43,100
- Yeah.

555
00:22:43,100 --> 00:22:43,940
- To get some head.

556
00:22:43,940 --> 00:22:45,700
- I would kill anyone for any reason.

557
00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:49,220
- Yeah, I think I would too if I had enough wanting to.

558
00:22:49,220 --> 00:22:54,020
- I would probably practice on women and children first.

559
00:22:54,020 --> 00:22:54,900
- 'Cause they're easier.

560
00:22:54,900 --> 00:22:55,740
- Yeah.

561
00:22:55,740 --> 00:22:57,540
- And then I would move on to older men.

562
00:22:57,540 --> 00:22:58,380
- Older men.

563
00:22:58,380 --> 00:22:59,380
- First though, you know what, I will say,

564
00:22:59,380 --> 00:23:01,740
I think guys my, then the most dangerous game.

565
00:23:01,740 --> 00:23:04,180
- Speaking of being a serial killer, I think a huge,

566
00:23:04,180 --> 00:23:07,700
a huge, no, that's not the most dangerous game at all.

567
00:23:07,700 --> 00:23:09,180
That's probably the least dangerous game.

568
00:23:09,180 --> 00:23:12,020
I mean the group we--

569
00:23:12,020 --> 00:23:14,260
You could be lured in by a piece of cheese on a box.

570
00:23:14,260 --> 00:23:14,760
No, no, no.

571
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:17,140
Like the guys that I'm speaking in second person.

572
00:23:17,140 --> 00:23:19,220
Guys that look like me, like you two.

573
00:23:19,220 --> 00:23:20,300
Guys that look like you.

574
00:23:20,300 --> 00:23:22,460
You think a guy that looks like me is dangerous?

575
00:23:22,460 --> 00:23:23,380
Yeah.

576
00:23:23,380 --> 00:23:24,300
I think I could lure--

577
00:23:24,300 --> 00:23:26,020
Probably dangerous behind a photo board.

578
00:23:26,020 --> 00:23:28,220
If you were doing most dangerous game with Patrick,

579
00:23:28,220 --> 00:23:29,420
what do you-- how are you getting him?

580
00:23:29,420 --> 00:23:30,380
Because I'm thinking I'm getting--

581
00:23:30,380 --> 00:23:32,340
I'm just going to walk up to him and grab him.

582
00:23:32,340 --> 00:23:34,340
He's like, oh, hey.

583
00:23:34,340 --> 00:23:36,660
Hey, Cameron.

584
00:23:36,660 --> 00:23:38,660
You have no idea how good I am at hiding.

585
00:23:38,660 --> 00:23:41,060
- I'd use retro game consoles to lure you

586
00:23:41,060 --> 00:23:44,700
into big pits where you die on spikes.

587
00:23:44,700 --> 00:23:46,300
- No, literally all you would have to do

588
00:23:46,300 --> 00:23:49,540
is just put some kind of skateboard stuff.

589
00:23:49,540 --> 00:23:52,420
- Some British comedy DVD entry.

590
00:23:52,420 --> 00:23:54,580
You'd kill yourself if I put it off of a cliff.

591
00:23:54,580 --> 00:23:57,220
- No, if I was in a Most Dangerous Game situation,

592
00:23:57,220 --> 00:23:58,820
I would kill myself immediately

593
00:23:58,820 --> 00:24:00,900
so that the other person doesn't win.

594
00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:02,180
- Wait, they win instantly.

595
00:24:02,180 --> 00:24:03,580
- No, that's not a win for them

596
00:24:03,580 --> 00:24:04,420
'cause the whole point--

597
00:24:04,420 --> 00:24:05,260
- Oh, they wanna hunt.

598
00:24:05,260 --> 00:24:09,900
want to hunt me, right? So the thrill of the hunt is like null and void because I

599
00:24:09,900 --> 00:24:12,060
took out whatever I like. Well, okay, let's okay.

600
00:24:12,060 --> 00:24:14,300
To the flare gun they gave me. I just want you dead out of my mouth.

601
00:24:14,300 --> 00:24:16,620
This scenario, it's a good thing to argue about, but let's be real,

602
00:24:16,620 --> 00:24:20,620
they're not going to pick you. They're not, no. Yeah, you're just never going to be on

603
00:24:20,620 --> 00:24:24,780
that island. If I'm on that island, it's as a butler. Well, no, but the butler would

604
00:24:24,780 --> 00:24:28,300
be listing off names. And I'm the worst butler. And how about Patrick Doren? And

605
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:31,340
the guy would be like, no, he flops. He'd be a flopper. That's how I would catch

606
00:24:31,340 --> 00:24:35,080
I'd put a pool out and you'd be like, "Oh."

607
00:24:35,080 --> 00:24:36,080
You'd be like, "Oh."

608
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:37,680
I'd be in the pool and I'd be stimming.

609
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:39,560
No, you'd be jumping and flopping into the pool.

610
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:40,560
Yeah, I'd be stimming in the pool.

611
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:41,560
You couldn't help yourself.

612
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:42,560
That's my stim.

613
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:44,960
I'd be stimming with the jets in the pool.

614
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:46,880
I'd be steaming you in the pool.

615
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:47,880
You know what I'm saying.

616
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:48,880
Yeah.

617
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:49,880
I'd put my feet on there and get a full massage.

618
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:53,440
But a mistake that a lot of serial killers make nowadays, that if I were to be a serial

619
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:58,700
killer that I would do before I went out and started bloody swath of women and getting them

620
00:24:58,700 --> 00:25:03,900
after dark in their apartments and the galleys and dumpsters, whatever, whatever, I would

621
00:25:03,900 --> 00:25:07,140
probably first remove all my DNA.

622
00:25:07,140 --> 00:25:08,140
Every part of DNA from your body.

623
00:25:08,140 --> 00:25:09,140
I would just get rid of my DNA.

624
00:25:09,140 --> 00:25:10,140
Burn it off.

625
00:25:10,140 --> 00:25:11,980
You could just change your DNA if you had a splicer.

626
00:25:11,980 --> 00:25:13,860
I would just, yeah, I would just splice it.

627
00:25:13,860 --> 00:25:14,860
That would be so good.

628
00:25:14,860 --> 00:25:15,860
Splice it with a cow.

629
00:25:15,860 --> 00:25:19,300
Oh my god, this is a cow that's going around killing people.

630
00:25:19,300 --> 00:25:23,340
But they would never expect a human if they keep finding cow DNA.

631
00:25:23,340 --> 00:25:25,140
And they would think...

632
00:25:25,140 --> 00:25:27,780
At first they'd be like, maybe he's wearing a cow skin jacket.

633
00:25:27,780 --> 00:25:31,140
- And there would be an article in the New York Post

634
00:25:31,140 --> 00:25:32,980
called Human Tipping.

635
00:25:32,980 --> 00:25:33,820
- Okay.

636
00:25:33,820 --> 00:25:34,640
- And it would be--

637
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:35,820
- The cow's going around tipping humans.

638
00:25:35,820 --> 00:25:36,660
- The Human Tipper.

639
00:25:36,660 --> 00:25:37,480
- The cow is--

640
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:39,320
- The Human Tipping Cow is walking around New York City.

641
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:41,260
- Again, another movie idea.

642
00:25:41,260 --> 00:25:42,380
- The Human Tipper.

643
00:25:42,380 --> 00:25:43,540
- The Human Tipper.

644
00:25:43,540 --> 00:25:44,380
- That is--

645
00:25:44,380 --> 00:25:46,620
- And he's part man, part cow.

646
00:25:46,620 --> 00:25:48,340
- How are we not millionaires?

647
00:25:48,340 --> 00:25:49,180
I don't understand.

648
00:25:49,180 --> 00:25:50,580
- We have a million great movie ideas

649
00:25:50,580 --> 00:25:51,420
and nobody listens to us.

650
00:25:51,420 --> 00:25:54,200
- Scott's Vacation, The Human Tipper.

651
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:55,040
- Let's think of a third movie.

652
00:25:55,040 --> 00:25:57,100
- What's the one where they get real small that we did?

653
00:25:57,100 --> 00:26:00,300
Shrinkers. Shrinkers in the whole Shrinkers series. That was my idea.

654
00:26:00,300 --> 00:26:03,500
Yeah, that's Cameron, yeah. Yeah, but we talked about it. We talked about it.

655
00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:06,300
We talked about it, but just I want to claim ownership over Shrinkers.

656
00:26:06,300 --> 00:26:10,300
That's okay. You can have that, but Shrinkers is Cameron's problem.

657
00:26:10,300 --> 00:26:12,700
Well, then I get Human Tippers and I get Scott's Vacation too.

658
00:26:12,700 --> 00:26:14,620
Well, I came up with Human Tippers DNA.

659
00:26:14,620 --> 00:26:15,100
That whole thing.

660
00:26:15,100 --> 00:26:17,900
Dude, did you come up with that name? And he said cow.

661
00:26:17,900 --> 00:26:18,460
What movie?

662
00:26:18,460 --> 00:26:21,100
You know, the person who comes up with the name of the movie doesn't get the movie.

663
00:26:21,100 --> 00:26:23,180
Well, you were just saying plans for your life.

664
00:26:23,180 --> 00:26:26,060
No, wait, it wasn't Scott's Vacation. It was As an Arrow.

665
00:26:26,060 --> 00:26:26,700
As an Arrow.

666
00:26:26,700 --> 00:26:27,800
- As an arrow. - As an arrow.

667
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:30,200
And I came up with the title, so I think I get that one.

668
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:33,180
- No you don't, 'cause I came up with the entire thing.

669
00:26:33,180 --> 00:26:34,860
- I came up with the part where it was actually--

670
00:26:34,860 --> 00:26:36,240
- Well you came up with human tippers

671
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:38,340
and I came up with the cow thing.

672
00:26:38,340 --> 00:26:40,000
- Okay, so me and you cut him out.

673
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,580
- Okay. - And I came up with shrinkers.

674
00:26:41,580 --> 00:26:42,620
- You didn't come up with shrinkers.

675
00:26:42,620 --> 00:26:43,900
- I came up with a movie-- - There's literally proof

676
00:26:43,900 --> 00:26:45,580
that I came up with shrinkers. - There's proof, run it back.

677
00:26:45,580 --> 00:26:47,540
- But I don't even remember which one it was.

678
00:26:47,540 --> 00:26:48,660
- What? - I don't remember

679
00:26:48,660 --> 00:26:51,700
any of my accomplishments, 'cause I'm so humble.

680
00:26:51,700 --> 00:26:53,380
- No, 'cause you flopped every single time

681
00:26:53,380 --> 00:26:54,220
you accomplished anything. - I did not flop

682
00:26:54,220 --> 00:26:55,220
every single time I make a movie.

683
00:26:55,220 --> 00:26:56,220
You've only flopped.

684
00:26:56,220 --> 00:27:00,180
I have never, ever flopped when we've come up with movie stuff.

685
00:27:00,180 --> 00:27:05,780
Your movies, if they were in theaters, people would be, okay, here's your movies, right?

686
00:27:05,780 --> 00:27:11,220
Your movies, the only person who would be in the theater to see your movies would be

687
00:27:11,220 --> 00:27:15,300
there doing an inglorious bastard, set the whole thing on fire, shooting bullets into

688
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:17,100
the crowd, but there'd be nobody there.

689
00:27:17,100 --> 00:27:19,820
There'd be nobody there because you didn't sell a single ticket.

690
00:27:19,820 --> 00:27:21,460
- If your movies are showing at the AMC,

691
00:27:21,460 --> 00:27:24,140
the workers would refuse to sweep the theater

692
00:27:24,140 --> 00:27:25,780
if the credits were still playing.

693
00:27:25,780 --> 00:27:26,620
They would not be going.

694
00:27:26,620 --> 00:27:28,680
- Hey, here's your movie theater, right?

695
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:30,540
Here's somebody going up to the concession stand

696
00:27:30,540 --> 00:27:31,580
outside of your movie.

697
00:27:31,580 --> 00:27:33,300
Yeah, could I have 50 tomatoes, please?

698
00:27:33,300 --> 00:27:35,260
- And could I have a box of flopcorn?

699
00:27:35,260 --> 00:27:36,100
- Yeah.

700
00:27:36,100 --> 00:27:37,280
(laughing)

701
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:38,120
- It would be in a box.

702
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:38,960
- And they would be throwing the tomatoes.

703
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:40,020
- It would be in a box, it would be in a bag.

704
00:27:40,020 --> 00:27:41,460
- And they'd be going to eat the flopcorn,

705
00:27:41,460 --> 00:27:42,380
realizing that it's-- - 'Cause it's a small size,

706
00:27:42,380 --> 00:27:43,280
'cause they don't even wanna spend

707
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:44,120
that much money at the theater.

708
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:46,180
- Yeah, 'cause people would buy tickets

709
00:27:46,180 --> 00:27:48,380
just to throw tomatoes at your--

710
00:27:48,380 --> 00:27:50,900
- So you're saying it would be the best worst movie ever?

711
00:27:50,900 --> 00:27:51,740
- Huh?

712
00:27:51,740 --> 00:27:52,740
- Flopcorn and soda flop for me.

713
00:27:52,740 --> 00:27:54,420
- You're saying it would be the best worst movie ever?

714
00:27:54,420 --> 00:27:55,260
- No, it wouldn't be,

715
00:27:55,260 --> 00:27:57,060
people would not like it like that either.

716
00:27:57,060 --> 00:27:59,140
It would not be a troll two kind of thing.

717
00:27:59,140 --> 00:28:02,200
- Well, the movie is called Patrick's Tomatoes.

718
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:04,740
- Flop. - Patrick's Tomato Target.

719
00:28:04,740 --> 00:28:06,140
(laughing)

720
00:28:06,140 --> 00:28:07,660
- Just a movie target.

721
00:28:07,660 --> 00:28:09,540
(laughing)

722
00:28:09,540 --> 00:28:10,820
- That was genius.

723
00:28:10,820 --> 00:28:14,380
- Okay, that was the first time in what,

724
00:28:14,380 --> 00:28:16,460
30 minutes that you have not flopped.

725
00:28:16,460 --> 00:28:17,300
- That's not true.

726
00:28:17,300 --> 00:28:20,420
perfect that you stuck the landing on that one. That was a perfect one. That

727
00:28:20,420 --> 00:28:22,340
was a pencil dive. You hit the bottom of the pool.

728
00:28:22,340 --> 00:28:29,980
It turns out it's a lot safer to flop because the pool's only two feet deep.

729
00:28:29,980 --> 00:28:37,980
Patrick's moving tomato target. It's three hours long. Oh my god. I would do

730
00:28:37,980 --> 00:28:42,820
it singing at IMAX. Yo, wow. Huge ass theater. It's like I can grab the target.

731
00:28:42,820 --> 00:28:46,660
It's harder too because the screen's so far away. I had to do special showings at

732
00:28:46,660 --> 00:28:51,540
the aquarium just so they can get the pig full through my max. Oh, that'd be sick. Yeah,

733
00:28:51,540 --> 00:28:55,820
damn. Or at a... Drive-in. Oh, a drive-in theater. Yeah. Oh my God. Maybe so you could

734
00:28:55,820 --> 00:28:59,100
build a PVC pipe... There'd be so many car accidents. ...kind of tomato cannon and blow

735
00:28:59,100 --> 00:29:03,620
it up. Oh, I was thinking like it's kind of like a derby and people would drive around

736
00:29:03,620 --> 00:29:10,340
in a circle at the drive-in. Or a movie. It's the movie Tomato Target movie. A movie is

737
00:29:10,340 --> 00:29:14,140
a derby... You know, I would... No, you're driving around the drive-in movie theater

738
00:29:14,140 --> 00:29:15,740
trying to hit it from your car.

739
00:29:15,740 --> 00:29:20,940
I would be so mad if I was having people over to watch a movie and I was like, "Alright

740
00:29:20,940 --> 00:29:24,700
guys, let's watch Pulp Fiction." And everybody else is like, "No, we want to watch Patrick's

741
00:29:24,700 --> 00:29:29,100
Moving Tomato Target." I'm like, "Please, we can do it at somebody else's house." I

742
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:30,540
already saw that, so I don't want to watch it.

743
00:29:30,540 --> 00:29:33,940
It sucks when you get the special edition on Blu-ray and it changes the target from

744
00:29:33,940 --> 00:29:34,940
red to green.

745
00:29:34,940 --> 00:29:40,380
Yeah. Patrick just kept going in and editing it after it was released. It's like, "Just

746
00:29:40,380 --> 00:29:41,800
Leave it in its original form.

747
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:43,920
- You have to get the D-Master off of Pirate Bay.

748
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:44,760
- Yeah, yeah.

749
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:45,900
- Give the people what they want.

750
00:29:45,900 --> 00:29:47,200
- They don't want the green target.

751
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:48,040
- Yeah, they want the red.

752
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:48,880
- They want the red target.

753
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:49,700
- In Mexico, I do.

754
00:29:49,700 --> 00:29:50,540
- What's the whole--

755
00:29:50,540 --> 00:29:51,380
- That's true, 'cause they got the green tomatoes in Mexico.

756
00:29:51,380 --> 00:29:54,180
- The whole tomato, just the stem is green.

757
00:29:54,180 --> 00:29:55,300
- Uh-huh, uh-huh.

758
00:29:55,300 --> 00:29:56,300
- No one wants to-- - Speak on it.

759
00:29:56,300 --> 00:29:57,740
- No one's thinking about the stem.

760
00:29:57,740 --> 00:29:58,580
Everyone's thinking about the stem.

761
00:29:58,580 --> 00:29:59,400
- Why?

762
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:00,860
- Big, red, juicy beefsteak tomato.

763
00:30:00,860 --> 00:30:04,560
- Why is there not more interactive movie theater experiences?

764
00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:05,840
That is such a good idea.

765
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:07,660
- Go to the Museum of Science in Boston.

766
00:30:07,660 --> 00:30:11,300
But I mean like, I should be able to go to AMC

767
00:30:11,300 --> 00:30:13,700
and there should be a Talking Tom movie

768
00:30:13,700 --> 00:30:14,540
where I can speak.

769
00:30:14,540 --> 00:30:15,480
- They have video games you can play

770
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:17,580
before the movie at AMC.

771
00:30:17,580 --> 00:30:21,100
- But why not an, like why not like a triple A,

772
00:30:21,100 --> 00:30:24,300
like very like high budget version of one of those

773
00:30:24,300 --> 00:30:25,740
where you can like make the decisions on your phone.

774
00:30:25,740 --> 00:30:28,700
- You wanna watch Bandersnatch in the theater?

775
00:30:28,700 --> 00:30:31,100
- No, no, no, 'cause I want there to be aliens and nudity.

776
00:30:31,100 --> 00:30:33,580
- To me, that's what most 3D movies are to me

777
00:30:33,580 --> 00:30:35,660
'cause I go to a 3D movie, I pretend I'm in the movie

778
00:30:35,660 --> 00:30:41,420
I'm like go left go walk through attack hello I do fight hello

779
00:30:41,420 --> 00:30:48,140
all right you argue argue your marriage story and movie and movie and sequence

780
00:30:48,140 --> 00:30:55,740
and and and and it now start to get 15 minutes is the entire and and in the

781
00:30:55,740 --> 00:31:00,700
movie and turn it off and movie and movie it's not a bad idea I've been in

782
00:31:00,700 --> 00:31:03,540
the movies in a while I was thinking about going tonight I did not but

783
00:31:03,540 --> 00:31:04,880
nothing looks very good to me right now.

784
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:06,480
I'm going hella to the movies.

785
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:08,780
I've not seen a movie since the Batman.

786
00:31:08,780 --> 00:31:09,320
I don't want to--

787
00:31:09,320 --> 00:31:10,880
Actually, no, I have not seen a movie.

788
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:11,800
You saw Avatar, right?

789
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:12,480
No.

790
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:13,040
Really?

791
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:14,320
Haven't seen a movie.

792
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:16,980
I thought the Batman was the last movie I saw in the theater.

793
00:31:16,980 --> 00:31:20,120
Last movie I saw in the theater was Sonic 2.

794
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:20,800
Really?

795
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:22,280
Actually, if you count--

796
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:23,720
You go to the movies less than I do.

797
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:25,040
I don't go to the movies at all.

798
00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:25,920
Wow.

799
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:28,680
The last-- if you want to get really technical--

800
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:29,240
Let's get it.

801
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:31,520
The last movie that I saw in a theater

802
00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:34,080
was when we were at the Grand Canyon,

803
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:36,040
or no, no, no, what's that big crater we went to?

804
00:31:36,040 --> 00:31:36,880
- Meteor crater.

805
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:38,920
- Meteor crater, and we went into that theater

806
00:31:38,920 --> 00:31:40,240
with the Jackie Lopez.

807
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:41,320
- Jackie Lopez. - Jackie Lopez.

808
00:31:41,320 --> 00:31:44,160
- That's the last movie I saw in the theater.

809
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:45,400
- Okay, we'll count that.

810
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:47,460
Last summer?

811
00:31:47,460 --> 00:31:50,360
Holy shit. - That's the last movie

812
00:31:50,360 --> 00:31:51,200
I've seen. - That's crazy.

813
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:52,240
- That was an amazing movie.

814
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:53,080
- Yeah, that was really, really good.

815
00:31:53,080 --> 00:31:53,920
- Jackie Lopez, they went out.

816
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:55,120
- Speaking of interactive movies.

817
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:57,600
- Yeah, they blew up a meteor.

818
00:31:57,600 --> 00:31:59,640
- You blow up a meteor with Jackie Lopez.

819
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:00,760
- You fly around. - Yeah, who is it?

820
00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:04,240
Jackalope, which is a rabbit mixed with antlers.

821
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:04,740
Yeah.

822
00:32:04,740 --> 00:32:05,240
Mixed with antlers.

823
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:05,740
Yeah.

824
00:32:05,740 --> 00:32:06,240
Yeah.

825
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:06,740
Yeah.

826
00:32:06,740 --> 00:32:08,240
Is it a real thing?

827
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:08,740
No, it's not real.

828
00:32:08,740 --> 00:32:09,740
Yeah, it's a real animal.

829
00:32:09,740 --> 00:32:12,240
Yes, it is real.

830
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:14,240
It's real.

831
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:15,740
I'm getting mixed signals.

832
00:32:15,740 --> 00:32:16,740
Knowledge flop.

833
00:32:16,740 --> 00:32:18,240
Knowledge flop.

834
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:20,740
Somebody I was talking to at one point in my life

835
00:32:20,740 --> 00:32:22,240
thought a jackalope was a real thing.

836
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:24,240
It was probably me.

837
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:25,240
I don't think it was you.

838
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:27,240
It was probably me after we left that theater.

839
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:29,740
And I was like, are we going to see a jackalope?

840
00:32:29,740 --> 00:32:31,520
(laughing)

841
00:32:31,520 --> 00:32:32,360
- I don't remember, I have no idea.

842
00:32:32,360 --> 00:32:35,580
- My mom didn't believe that a narwhal was a real thing.

843
00:32:35,580 --> 00:32:36,420
- See, that's the thing--

844
00:32:36,420 --> 00:32:38,060
- That's one you don't think is real as a kid.

845
00:32:38,060 --> 00:32:38,900
- Yeah, that one--

846
00:32:38,900 --> 00:32:39,980
- But my mom was 40.

847
00:32:39,980 --> 00:32:42,340
- That one is real, I think I get the two,

848
00:32:42,340 --> 00:32:44,260
I'm like, there's no way a narwhal is real,

849
00:32:44,260 --> 00:32:45,940
but a jackalope, that could happen.

850
00:32:45,940 --> 00:32:47,580
- It is, there equally is.

851
00:32:47,580 --> 00:32:50,100
- A jackalope is one of the animals that could be real.

852
00:32:50,100 --> 00:32:50,940
- It could absolutely be real.

853
00:32:50,940 --> 00:32:51,780
- Yeah, it's an easy one.

854
00:32:51,780 --> 00:32:52,780
- It could definitely be real.

855
00:32:52,780 --> 00:32:54,940
- Through enough genetic splicing.

856
00:32:54,940 --> 00:32:57,180
- No, narwhal is real, no, it just like could be normal.

857
00:32:57,180 --> 00:33:00,300
Just like if it had little antlers coming off of a rabbit,

858
00:33:00,300 --> 00:33:01,140
that would make sense to me.

859
00:33:01,140 --> 00:33:03,140
A narwhal, I think, is less--

860
00:33:03,140 --> 00:33:06,740
A narwhal is literally like a fucking-- it's nothing.

861
00:33:06,740 --> 00:33:09,540
You know, a narwhal, that's a tooth, not a horn.

862
00:33:09,540 --> 00:33:10,040
Yeah.

863
00:33:10,040 --> 00:33:11,140
It grows out of its mouth.

864
00:33:11,140 --> 00:33:13,060
It's a big, long tooth.

865
00:33:13,060 --> 00:33:15,060
Its body is the real confusing part.

866
00:33:15,060 --> 00:33:17,220
Because it's not like a normal fish.

867
00:33:17,220 --> 00:33:18,780
It's basically just a blob.

868
00:33:18,780 --> 00:33:21,260
The body is just a mouth.

869
00:33:21,260 --> 00:33:21,980
Yeah.

870
00:33:21,980 --> 00:33:22,820
Is it a mammal?

871
00:33:22,820 --> 00:33:23,420
It's all it is.

872
00:33:23,420 --> 00:33:24,340
It's a whale, I think.

873
00:33:24,340 --> 00:33:25,500
Oh, wow.

874
00:33:25,500 --> 00:33:27,100
Well, with a big tooth.

875
00:33:27,100 --> 00:33:28,100
Man.

876
00:33:28,100 --> 00:33:29,540
That's where the name comes from.

877
00:33:29,540 --> 00:33:30,540
Yeah, wall.

878
00:33:30,540 --> 00:33:31,540
Narwhal.

879
00:33:31,540 --> 00:33:33,220
Yeah, North Whale, I bet.

880
00:33:33,220 --> 00:33:35,620
Because it has a tooth on the north.

881
00:33:35,620 --> 00:33:36,620
Because it's from the north.

882
00:33:36,620 --> 00:33:37,620
From the north side.

883
00:33:37,620 --> 00:33:38,620
North side, north side.

884
00:33:38,620 --> 00:33:46,260
But yeah, I think that I, you also don't see narwhals that often.

885
00:33:46,260 --> 00:33:47,860
No, not very often at all.

886
00:33:47,860 --> 00:33:50,460
I don't, I mean I saw a picture of somebody eating one.

887
00:33:50,460 --> 00:33:54,420
I guess if I was, I guess if I lived in the Arctic Circle I would see them more maybe.

888
00:33:54,420 --> 00:33:55,740
- If I lived in the Arctic Circle, yeah,

889
00:33:55,740 --> 00:33:57,900
I would probably think a lot of animals weren't real.

890
00:33:57,900 --> 00:34:02,900
- Do you guys believe in deep, dark, downstairs animals?

891
00:34:02,900 --> 00:34:07,060
At the very bottom floor of the ocean?

892
00:34:07,060 --> 00:34:08,580
- There are some of them so weird,

893
00:34:08,580 --> 00:34:10,660
they're like hands that run around down there.

894
00:34:10,660 --> 00:34:12,340
- What's that, that anglerfish?

895
00:34:12,340 --> 00:34:14,500
- There's little goobers running around

896
00:34:14,500 --> 00:34:17,060
on the bottom of the ocean and it's pissing me off.

897
00:34:17,060 --> 00:34:18,780
They're going, "You'll never catch me,

898
00:34:18,780 --> 00:34:20,180
"you'll never know I exist."

899
00:34:20,180 --> 00:34:22,580
- Longer than a long girl's hair.

900
00:34:22,580 --> 00:34:24,500
- There's some that are thinner than a needle.

901
00:34:24,500 --> 00:34:26,740
- How scary was that animal at the bottom of the ocean?

902
00:34:26,740 --> 00:34:28,460
- A hundred points of scary.

903
00:34:28,460 --> 00:34:29,300
- How scary do you think that one is?

904
00:34:29,300 --> 00:34:31,700
- Speaking of scary, here's my scary.

905
00:34:31,700 --> 00:34:33,100
- How scary do you think that one is?

906
00:34:33,100 --> 00:34:33,940
- Here's my scary one.

907
00:34:33,940 --> 00:34:35,220
- That one big scary fish.

908
00:34:35,220 --> 00:34:36,060
- Yeah.

909
00:34:36,060 --> 00:34:38,100
- Well that's, I always, I think that there probably is--

910
00:34:38,100 --> 00:34:39,020
- SpongeBob movie scary.

911
00:34:39,020 --> 00:34:40,580
- There probably is a full on--

912
00:34:40,580 --> 00:34:41,420
- Mate monster.

913
00:34:41,420 --> 00:34:42,240
- Mate, don't even give me that.

914
00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:43,080
- There's a full on kraken.

915
00:34:43,080 --> 00:34:43,920
- I have to go to bed after this.

916
00:34:43,920 --> 00:34:44,900
- Yeah, well that's the thing, dude,

917
00:34:44,900 --> 00:34:46,920
they didn't even know, they thought the giant squid

918
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:48,660
was fake until like 2006 or something.

919
00:34:48,660 --> 00:34:49,500
- Yeah, exactly.

920
00:34:49,500 --> 00:34:50,340
- Yeah.

921
00:34:50,340 --> 00:34:51,180
- That's for like--

922
00:34:51,180 --> 00:34:52,740
- There's a full crack.

923
00:34:52,740 --> 00:34:54,500
- For as long as humans went in the ocean,

924
00:34:54,500 --> 00:34:56,900
they were like, "That's not real, whatever."

925
00:34:56,900 --> 00:34:59,500
- What if there's like a humanoid type guy down there?

926
00:34:59,500 --> 00:35:01,820
- There's copies of all of us down there.

927
00:35:01,820 --> 00:35:03,220
Just like, just some guy.

928
00:35:03,220 --> 00:35:05,220
- People are always like, "Parallel universes."

929
00:35:05,220 --> 00:35:06,140
- It's the ocean.

930
00:35:06,140 --> 00:35:06,980
- No, it's the ocean.

931
00:35:06,980 --> 00:35:07,820
That's where the parallel is.

932
00:35:07,820 --> 00:35:09,220
- The ocean is an actual parallel universe.

933
00:35:09,220 --> 00:35:10,300
- That's where the parallel is.

934
00:35:10,300 --> 00:35:11,940
Every choice you made, the ocean,

935
00:35:11,940 --> 00:35:13,500
your ocean self made the opposite.

936
00:35:13,500 --> 00:35:15,940
- That is honestly making me so actually scared.

937
00:35:15,940 --> 00:35:17,860
- If you're a nerd, your ocean self is a jock.

938
00:35:17,860 --> 00:35:20,020
If you are a goth, your ocean self is a prep.

939
00:35:20,020 --> 00:35:22,920
If you are a boy, your ocean self is also a boy.

940
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:23,760
It doesn't go like that.

941
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:24,960
- It doesn't change gender.

942
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:26,060
- Here's my UFOs.

943
00:35:26,060 --> 00:35:27,740
- Gender is just a concept.

944
00:35:27,740 --> 00:35:29,840
- Here's my other movie, UFO Twist.

945
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:31,100
We've been seeing all these UFOs.

946
00:35:31,100 --> 00:35:31,940
They're not from up there.

947
00:35:31,940 --> 00:35:34,300
- Here's my movie, UFO Twist.

948
00:35:34,300 --> 00:35:38,060
And it's mist twist, Sierra mist alien.

949
00:35:38,060 --> 00:35:38,900
- What?

950
00:35:38,900 --> 00:35:40,920
Sorry, I just had my life deflated.

951
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:42,340
- UFO Twist.

952
00:35:42,340 --> 00:35:43,260
- I don't know what that means.

953
00:35:43,260 --> 00:35:45,460
- Lemon lime alien, man.

954
00:35:45,460 --> 00:35:47,580
- Why are you flopping in the middle of my conversation?

955
00:35:47,580 --> 00:35:49,260
I'm trying to have a conversation about something cool

956
00:35:49,260 --> 00:35:52,660
You're just flopping all over every word that I say.

957
00:35:52,660 --> 00:35:53,500
- I'm making up a new alien.

958
00:35:53,500 --> 00:35:54,320
- I'm making up a new alien.

959
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:55,160
- I'm making up a new alien.

960
00:35:55,160 --> 00:35:56,000
- Just add that buttermilk to soda, fuck you.

961
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:56,820
- Soda alien.

962
00:35:56,820 --> 00:35:58,500
You need to go be sent to a flopical island.

963
00:35:58,500 --> 00:35:59,980
- You need to go, no.

964
00:35:59,980 --> 00:36:01,820
- On a flopical vacation.

965
00:36:01,820 --> 00:36:04,620
- You don't suck, you're one of my closest allies.

966
00:36:04,620 --> 00:36:07,060
But you are flopping up and stinking up

967
00:36:07,060 --> 00:36:08,700
like smelly shit right now.

968
00:36:08,700 --> 00:36:09,540
- I'm not flopping.

969
00:36:09,540 --> 00:36:10,620
- Talking about soda.

970
00:36:10,620 --> 00:36:12,860
- Soda alien, mistwist the alien.

971
00:36:12,860 --> 00:36:15,140
- This guy's soda, so damn floppy.

972
00:36:15,140 --> 00:36:18,260
- I'm not floppy.

973
00:36:18,260 --> 00:36:19,460
You're floppy.

974
00:36:19,460 --> 00:36:20,460
That one?

975
00:36:20,460 --> 00:36:21,460
Tell him I'm not floppy.

976
00:36:21,460 --> 00:36:24,940
I don't think you've been flopping as hard as he thinks you've been flopping, but lemon,

977
00:36:24,940 --> 00:36:25,940
lime, whatever.

978
00:36:25,940 --> 00:36:26,940
Lemon, lime, alien.

979
00:36:26,940 --> 00:36:29,700
Yeah, that's going to be a flop.

980
00:36:29,700 --> 00:36:33,700
That was especially because me and him were talking about a cool, scientific.

981
00:36:33,700 --> 00:36:34,700
We were going science.

982
00:36:34,700 --> 00:36:38,780
We were going science and you were just interrupting with like a five year old.

983
00:36:38,780 --> 00:36:39,780
This is science.

984
00:36:39,780 --> 00:36:40,780
This is not science.

985
00:36:40,780 --> 00:36:41,780
It's science because it's space.

986
00:36:41,780 --> 00:36:42,780
Okay, you know what?

987
00:36:42,780 --> 00:36:43,780
We'll pause our life changing conversation.

988
00:36:43,780 --> 00:36:47,020
Go ahead and explain soda alien.

989
00:36:47,020 --> 00:36:51,180
They just changed the name of Sierra Mist from Sierra,

990
00:36:51,180 --> 00:36:55,740
it went Sierra Mist, Mist Twist, Mist Twist, Starry.

991
00:36:55,740 --> 00:37:00,740
Starry, space, lemon lime alien, mascot.

992
00:37:00,740 --> 00:37:04,580
We get into PepsiCo, we explain to them

993
00:37:04,580 --> 00:37:09,420
that they need a lemon lime alien to promote Starry.

994
00:37:09,420 --> 00:37:12,720
We make a million.

995
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:16,980
- And you were like, this is a home run.

996
00:37:16,980 --> 00:37:22,460
a home run. This is a home run idea. This is probably one of the best ideas I've ever had.

997
00:37:22,460 --> 00:37:36,660
Flop ball! You're out! Flop. That says flap. You flopped. Me and him were talking about

998
00:37:36,660 --> 00:37:40,380
how cool it would be. You know what, I can admit my flops though. If you ever were presented

999
00:37:40,380 --> 00:37:43,180
with a flop, I think you would go psychotic.

1000
00:37:43,180 --> 00:37:49,180
The thing about that, I'm flopped since birth.

1001
00:37:49,180 --> 00:37:51,180
Yeah? You only flop?

1002
00:37:51,180 --> 00:37:57,860
I'm in like, my whole life is a Rocky training montage of learning not to flop, but I haven't

1003
00:37:57,860 --> 00:38:03,020
finished it. It won't be done until I die. So it doesn't bother me if I flop.

1004
00:38:03,020 --> 00:38:04,020
It's in your genes.

1005
00:38:04,020 --> 00:38:05,020
I'm ready for it.

1006
00:38:05,020 --> 00:38:08,820
You're in the army, on your helmet, you're born to flop.

1007
00:38:08,820 --> 00:38:15,820
like someone I say yeah I flop and I like doesn't hurt much I flop before yeah you

1008
00:38:15,820 --> 00:38:20,780
know I'm kind of like grizzled death by a thousand flops yeah oh I wouldn't like to

1009
00:38:20,780 --> 00:38:26,260
die that way that's gonna how he's dying right now yeah anyway but I I worked I go

1010
00:38:26,260 --> 00:38:30,300
through all my flop I was born in the flop molded by yeah you merely adopted

1011
00:38:30,300 --> 00:38:35,540
the flop yeah that kind of type type deal flop Hardy yeah look in that picture the

1012
00:38:35,540 --> 00:38:37,540
Flop Night Rides Flops.

1013
00:38:37,540 --> 00:38:39,540
Flop Hardly.

1014
00:38:39,540 --> 00:38:41,540
The guy in the army thing, the army helmet, that photo from Vietnam.

1015
00:38:41,540 --> 00:38:43,540
He's got like "meet his murder" written on his helmet or whatever.

1016
00:38:43,540 --> 00:38:45,540
It says "Flop Eric".

1017
00:38:45,540 --> 00:38:49,540
Pretty good.

1018
00:38:49,540 --> 00:38:51,540
Photoshop challenge for the fans.

1019
00:38:51,540 --> 00:38:53,540
Photoshop battle.

1020
00:38:53,540 --> 00:38:55,540
We need to start doing Photoshop battles again.

1021
00:38:55,540 --> 00:38:59,540
Somebody Photoshop him to be just sideways falling into a pool on his stomach.

1022
00:38:59,540 --> 00:39:03,540
If you could just do that.

1023
00:39:03,540 --> 00:39:10,020
that. Please make it a gift. Yeah. And have it in rainbow letters. So I can just respond

1024
00:39:10,020 --> 00:39:14,140
to everything. Flopping into peanut butter? Is that what you just said? What? How did

1025
00:39:14,140 --> 00:39:20,700
I just hear that? Hearing flop. Hearing flop. I'm having a full on. What did I say? What

1026
00:39:20,700 --> 00:39:25,220
did I say? I thought you said that you want them to photoshop me flopping into a pool

1027
00:39:25,220 --> 00:39:31,820
of peanut butter. I said make it a... What did I even say? Make it a gift so we can upload

1028
00:39:31,820 --> 00:39:38,820
to Twitter. Oh my, the word in my head, I heard peanut butter. Peanut butter. I don't know.

1029
00:39:38,820 --> 00:39:46,600
Upload it to peanut butter. The thing is, I've gotten. You've got to get this gif onto peanut

1030
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:53,760
butter.com. I've gotten a small enough amount of sleep this past week that I was trying

1031
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:57,360
to, I feel like I genuinely could have messed up and said something that sounded like peanut

1032
00:39:57,360 --> 00:40:01,280
butter, but I was really trying to walk through it. Are all of us feeling, are you guys also

1033
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:03,080
I'm feeling like you're kind of running on E today.

1034
00:40:03,080 --> 00:40:04,760
- I'm going through a shift.

1035
00:40:04,760 --> 00:40:05,920
- A flop mode.

1036
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:07,160
- I'm gonna be real with you, Patrick.

1037
00:40:07,160 --> 00:40:10,200
I'm taking it out on you, but I'm feeling a bit floppy.

1038
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:12,120
- Can I drive Patrick home?

1039
00:40:12,120 --> 00:40:13,520
- No, I'm not going home.

1040
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:14,920
I have to go to the gym after this.

1041
00:40:14,920 --> 00:40:16,600
- I also have to go to the pet store.

1042
00:40:16,600 --> 00:40:17,440
I have to get more cat food.

1043
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:18,800
- Which gym are you going to?

1044
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:23,840
- The most expensive one in the entire city.

1045
00:40:23,840 --> 00:40:28,280
- Whoa, is it that one next to the mansion?

1046
00:40:28,280 --> 00:40:29,120
- No.

1047
00:40:29,120 --> 00:40:30,640
- Oh, the mansion.

1048
00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:32,040
- The mansion. - The mansion.

1049
00:40:32,040 --> 00:40:32,940
- Wow.

1050
00:40:32,940 --> 00:40:36,180
- But I do think that, by the end of my life,

1051
00:40:36,180 --> 00:40:40,300
I'm much more interested in if NASA came up to me

1052
00:40:40,300 --> 00:40:43,700
and then SESO came up to me.

1053
00:40:43,700 --> 00:40:44,540
- Yeah.

1054
00:40:44,540 --> 00:40:46,500
- And they were like, NASA says,

1055
00:40:46,500 --> 00:40:48,740
"We'll take you to space," and SESO says--

1056
00:40:48,740 --> 00:40:50,340
- Says, "We can air your flops."

1057
00:40:50,340 --> 00:40:52,780
- No, this is a different SESO.

1058
00:40:52,780 --> 00:40:53,780
SESO-- - What's SESO?

1059
00:40:53,780 --> 00:40:54,620
What do you mean?

1060
00:40:54,620 --> 00:40:57,100
- It's basically the C version of NASA.

1061
00:40:57,100 --> 00:40:58,260
- Why'd you say SESO?

1062
00:40:58,260 --> 00:41:00,500
- Because I just heard that in my head,

1063
00:41:00,500 --> 00:41:02,460
So is that a CISO?

1064
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:04,860
CISO, like we got--

1065
00:41:04,860 --> 00:41:06,180
it would stand for something.

1066
00:41:06,180 --> 00:41:07,700
JASH.

1067
00:41:07,700 --> 00:41:08,860
No, not-- OK, not--

1068
00:41:08,860 --> 00:41:09,500
JASH and BUN.

1069
00:41:09,500 --> 00:41:11,460
Not that CISO.

1070
00:41:11,460 --> 00:41:12,140
A different one.

1071
00:41:12,140 --> 00:41:14,540
S-E-A-S-O.

1072
00:41:14,540 --> 00:41:15,500
Oh, Sea Org.

1073
00:41:15,500 --> 00:41:16,460
You're thinking of Sea Org.

1074
00:41:16,460 --> 00:41:17,660
Scientology Sea Org.

1075
00:41:17,660 --> 00:41:20,180
No, this is S-E-A-S-O. And they go down--

1076
00:41:20,180 --> 00:41:22,460
That's still a very powerful Navy.

1077
00:41:22,460 --> 00:41:23,260
They go down into--

1078
00:41:23,260 --> 00:41:25,060
They're one of the most powerful navies.

1079
00:41:25,060 --> 00:41:26,100
And they're the best.

1080
00:41:26,100 --> 00:41:28,100
They're probably the best Navy.

1081
00:41:28,100 --> 00:41:29,820
Sea Org only has two ships.

1082
00:41:29,820 --> 00:41:31,340
- They're the biggest ships in the world

1083
00:41:31,340 --> 00:41:32,860
and they're gonna take us to Xenu.

1084
00:41:32,860 --> 00:41:34,620
- See, so if NASA said--

1085
00:41:34,620 --> 00:41:35,460
- Xenu.

1086
00:41:35,460 --> 00:41:38,060
- If NASA, he's flopping all over what I'm trying to say.

1087
00:41:38,060 --> 00:41:39,300
Will you do something about this, Cameron?

1088
00:41:39,300 --> 00:41:40,500
- He's crying.

1089
00:41:40,500 --> 00:41:43,700
- If NASA said, "I wanna take you to space,"

1090
00:41:43,700 --> 00:41:45,900
and CESA said, "I wanna take you to the bottom of the ocean,"

1091
00:41:45,900 --> 00:41:47,380
I'm going to the bottom of the ocean.

1092
00:41:47,380 --> 00:41:49,980
It's way more interesting to me than space.

1093
00:41:49,980 --> 00:41:51,260
I don't care about space.

1094
00:41:51,260 --> 00:41:52,820
- No, I'll go to space.

1095
00:41:52,820 --> 00:41:53,780
- Yeah, I'd go to space.

1096
00:41:53,780 --> 00:41:55,620
- Sorry, did they ask you too?

1097
00:41:55,620 --> 00:41:56,460
- Yeah.

1098
00:41:56,460 --> 00:41:57,280
- No, I don't think they did.

1099
00:41:57,280 --> 00:41:58,120
- I don't think CESA--

1100
00:41:58,120 --> 00:41:58,960
- I think they did ask me.

1101
00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:00,220
- You did ask me. - It don't exist.

1102
00:42:00,220 --> 00:42:01,460
- You wish.

1103
00:42:01,460 --> 00:42:05,340
- CISO asked you which TV show from the 90s

1104
00:42:05,340 --> 00:42:08,640
should we put on our platform that we have the rights to,

1105
00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:13,220
and it was a choice between Joey and--

1106
00:42:13,220 --> 00:42:14,460
- Joey. - Friends,

1107
00:42:14,460 --> 00:42:18,140
and you chose Joey, and that's why the whole company flopped.

1108
00:42:18,140 --> 00:42:18,980
- I made the decision.

1109
00:42:18,980 --> 00:42:20,900
- You made the decision.

1110
00:42:20,900 --> 00:42:23,820
We met Caleb, 'cause he was a rep at CISO.

1111
00:42:23,820 --> 00:42:26,540
- Yeah, CISO wanted you to write and direct a show

1112
00:42:26,540 --> 00:42:27,940
called Funny Commercials.

1113
00:42:27,940 --> 00:42:30,580
(laughing)

1114
00:42:30,580 --> 00:42:32,580
- And you pick that up and go into space.

1115
00:42:32,580 --> 00:42:34,700
(laughing)

1116
00:42:34,700 --> 00:42:36,220
- I would do that, I'd make funny commercials.

1117
00:42:36,220 --> 00:42:37,940
- I would too, that's actually--

1118
00:42:37,940 --> 00:42:41,420
- That's easy, you sell a four minute commercial

1119
00:42:41,420 --> 00:42:43,180
for a fart, you sell a fart, easy.

1120
00:42:43,180 --> 00:42:46,860
- They used to at the end of every year on TBS,

1121
00:42:46,860 --> 00:42:48,980
it was hosted by Kevin Nealon,

1122
00:42:48,980 --> 00:42:52,460
and it was called the funniest commercials of the year.

1123
00:42:52,460 --> 00:42:53,460
- Really? - Yeah.

1124
00:42:53,460 --> 00:42:54,300
- That's so sick.

1125
00:42:54,300 --> 00:42:56,080
- And it was like the top 100 commercials,

1126
00:42:56,080 --> 00:42:59,420
and it's Kevin Nealon walking around Times Square just like,

1127
00:42:59,420 --> 00:43:02,000
and here's an ad from Japan that's gonna make you go,

1128
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:03,480
cool, I like that show.

1129
00:43:03,480 --> 00:43:05,800
That's easier than America's Funniest Home Videos

1130
00:43:05,800 --> 00:43:07,640
'cause the commercials are already on TV.

1131
00:43:07,640 --> 00:43:08,560
Yeah. You don't have to take 'em

1132
00:43:08,560 --> 00:43:10,320
from the video and put 'em on the TV.

1133
00:43:10,320 --> 00:43:12,160
It's so crazy that like--

1134
00:43:12,160 --> 00:43:13,680
They still have that show.

1135
00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:16,040
Commercials suck now. It's called the Super Bowl.

1136
00:43:16,040 --> 00:43:18,340
Commercials suck now 'cause they've gone woke.

1137
00:43:18,340 --> 00:43:19,960
Which commercial went woke?

1138
00:43:19,960 --> 00:43:21,180
I thought-- Oreo.

1139
00:43:21,180 --> 00:43:25,080
How did Oreo go? Rainbow filling.

1140
00:43:25,080 --> 00:43:25,920
Really?

1141
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:28,560
Oh, they got rid of the white part of the cookie

1142
00:43:28,560 --> 00:43:30,480
and they replaced it with a rainbow.

1143
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:31,320
Like they're trying to do the entire world.

1144
00:43:31,320 --> 00:43:34,080
Oreos used to be about unity between black and white.

1145
00:43:34,080 --> 00:43:35,840
It used to be about the perfect ratio

1146
00:43:35,840 --> 00:43:37,800
of two black and one white.

1147
00:43:37,800 --> 00:43:39,480
That every single household should be.

1148
00:43:39,480 --> 00:43:42,680
Then they changed it to a rainbow filling in the middle

1149
00:43:42,680 --> 00:43:46,040
to represent two black guys who are gay.

1150
00:43:46,040 --> 00:43:46,880
Come on, man.

1151
00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:48,680
And that's wokeness gone amok.

1152
00:43:48,680 --> 00:43:51,720
Wokeness has gone a little amok in regards to Oreos.

1153
00:43:51,720 --> 00:43:52,560
Did you see Joe?

1154
00:43:52,560 --> 00:43:54,200
Two black guys and a green guy in the middle?

1155
00:43:54,200 --> 00:43:55,720
- What the hell's going on?

1156
00:43:55,720 --> 00:43:58,040
It used to be me between those two black guys.

1157
00:43:58,040 --> 00:43:58,880
- Hey!

1158
00:43:58,880 --> 00:43:59,880
- Now it's some green guy.

1159
00:43:59,880 --> 00:44:01,800
- I'm sticking with this little fucking green guy.

1160
00:44:01,800 --> 00:44:03,520
- Yeah, he's taking my spot.

1161
00:44:03,520 --> 00:44:06,720
- You see that Joe Rogan's opening up a new comedy club?

1162
00:44:06,720 --> 00:44:08,000
- Dude, Comedy Mothership.

1163
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:08,840
- Is that what it's called?

1164
00:44:08,840 --> 00:44:10,200
- Yeah, we're gonna go do that.

1165
00:44:10,200 --> 00:44:11,040
- Yeah?

1166
00:44:11,040 --> 00:44:11,860
- Yeah, let's do it.

1167
00:44:11,860 --> 00:44:12,700
- Is it in Austin?

1168
00:44:12,700 --> 00:44:13,540
- Yeah.

1169
00:44:13,540 --> 00:44:16,600
- We should definitely go to a show at Comedy Mothership.

1170
00:44:16,600 --> 00:44:17,440
- We could do it.

1171
00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:18,260
- You think we could?

1172
00:44:18,260 --> 00:44:19,100
- Yeah, whatever.

1173
00:44:19,100 --> 00:44:20,480
- Dude, that'd be so amazing.

1174
00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:21,320
- Yeah.

1175
00:44:21,320 --> 00:44:23,080
- And we go up there and we are tearing the fuck out of--

1176
00:44:23,080 --> 00:44:25,840
- Should we just do our own version of Kill Tony

1177
00:44:25,840 --> 00:44:27,920
up here in New York City?

1178
00:44:27,920 --> 00:44:29,600
Where we just have people come up,

1179
00:44:29,600 --> 00:44:31,280
but we're just real nice to them.

1180
00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:32,100
- Yeah.

1181
00:44:32,100 --> 00:44:32,940
- Where they do their standup, we're like--

1182
00:44:32,940 --> 00:44:33,980
- Friendly way to save Tony.

1183
00:44:33,980 --> 00:44:34,820
- Yeah, we go--

1184
00:44:34,820 --> 00:44:35,640
- We do save Tony.

1185
00:44:35,640 --> 00:44:36,480
- Where's Tony?

1186
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:37,320
And we go--

1187
00:44:37,320 --> 00:44:38,140
- Hi, Tony.

1188
00:44:38,140 --> 00:44:38,980
(laughing)

1189
00:44:38,980 --> 00:44:41,400
- Hi, Tony, with the bottom of those boys.

1190
00:44:41,400 --> 00:44:43,160
And people go up and they do standup, we go,

1191
00:44:43,160 --> 00:44:44,000
that was actually really nice.

1192
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:44,840
- That was really funny.

1193
00:44:44,840 --> 00:44:45,660
- Yeah.

1194
00:44:45,660 --> 00:44:46,560
- You should take that on the road.

1195
00:44:46,560 --> 00:44:50,040
- Yeah, take that one minute on the road.

1196
00:44:50,040 --> 00:44:51,720
- That's what that whole show is.

1197
00:44:51,720 --> 00:44:55,120
- The show is that they get homeless guys to come up

1198
00:44:55,120 --> 00:44:58,160
and do one minute of comedy and go (mumbles)

1199
00:44:58,160 --> 00:44:59,000
and then they go--

1200
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:01,320
- I've seen the only clips I've ever seen from that are like--

1201
00:45:01,320 --> 00:45:03,560
- Tony Hintzler goes, "You look seriously,

1202
00:45:03,560 --> 00:45:07,040
"I can't tell if you're fucking homeless or a hipster."

1203
00:45:07,040 --> 00:45:09,200
And they go, "Oh my God!"

1204
00:45:09,200 --> 00:45:11,680
And Dom Irera's there and he falls over

1205
00:45:11,680 --> 00:45:13,160
'cause he gets so high on the cigar.

1206
00:45:13,160 --> 00:45:14,040
- Yeah. - Yeah.

1207
00:45:14,040 --> 00:45:16,280
- The only clips I've ever seen of Kill Tony,

1208
00:45:16,280 --> 00:45:18,760
and it really for a long time made me believe

1209
00:45:18,760 --> 00:45:22,840
that it was him letting disabled people

1210
00:45:22,840 --> 00:45:24,240
do standup for one minute.

1211
00:45:24,240 --> 00:45:25,480
- It was.

1212
00:45:25,480 --> 00:45:27,360
- Yeah, because every single clip I've seen

1213
00:45:27,360 --> 00:45:30,840
has been like disabled person crushes at Kill Tony.

1214
00:45:30,840 --> 00:45:32,380
(laughing)

1215
00:45:32,380 --> 00:45:34,160
- That's 'cause that's the only chance you have

1216
00:45:34,160 --> 00:45:37,000
if you, to do a one minute standup set and do well.

1217
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:37,840
- Yeah.

1218
00:45:37,840 --> 00:45:40,040
- You need to have something that is,

1219
00:45:40,040 --> 00:45:41,040
well how do I say this?

1220
00:45:41,040 --> 00:45:42,160
- Yeah, where are you going?

1221
00:45:42,160 --> 00:45:45,240
- You need to have something that is immediately funny

1222
00:45:45,240 --> 00:45:46,080
when you go up.

1223
00:45:46,080 --> 00:45:46,900
- Yeah.

1224
00:45:46,900 --> 00:45:47,740
- So you need to have some,

1225
00:45:47,740 --> 00:45:51,040
- You need to have a tiny, you need to have one tiny arm,

1226
00:45:51,040 --> 00:45:52,740
or your head's too small,

1227
00:45:52,740 --> 00:45:55,200
or you have one leg shorter than the other.

1228
00:45:55,200 --> 00:45:58,140
- You go up there on Kill Tony,

1229
00:45:58,140 --> 00:46:02,740
you get caught weeks later when the clip is uploaded

1230
00:46:02,740 --> 00:46:05,060
'cause you've been faking a disability.

1231
00:46:05,060 --> 00:46:06,340
- Yeah, I would do that.

1232
00:46:06,340 --> 00:46:09,220
I'd fake a disability to be a Kill Tony superstar.

1233
00:46:09,220 --> 00:46:11,540
- I would love nothing more

1234
00:46:11,540 --> 00:46:13,580
than to be a Kill Tony superstar.

1235
00:46:13,580 --> 00:46:16,140
That's my dream. - You go up on a lawnmower.

1236
00:46:16,140 --> 00:46:18,940
You're like, "Yeah, I just can't afford a wheelchair."

1237
00:46:18,940 --> 00:46:21,180
(laughing)

1238
00:46:21,180 --> 00:46:24,540
- They're like, "Okay."

1239
00:46:24,540 --> 00:46:28,500
- Yeah, I'm disabled, I'm paralyzed from the waist down.

1240
00:46:28,500 --> 00:46:29,980
I couldn't afford a wheelchair.

1241
00:46:29,980 --> 00:46:34,220
The only thing that my family can afford is our John Deere.

1242
00:46:34,220 --> 00:46:36,060
- If I'm getting--

1243
00:46:36,060 --> 00:46:37,980
- You can't hear the set at all.

1244
00:46:37,980 --> 00:46:39,740
(imitates engine revving)

1245
00:46:39,740 --> 00:46:41,540
It's just (imitates engine revving)

1246
00:46:41,540 --> 00:46:42,380
just puttering.

1247
00:46:42,380 --> 00:46:43,580
- If I get-- - It's the worst engine

1248
00:46:43,580 --> 00:46:44,820
in the world.

1249
00:46:44,820 --> 00:46:46,820
If I get um...

1250
00:46:46,820 --> 00:46:48,820
(Inaudible)

1251
00:46:48,820 --> 00:46:50,820
(Inaudible)

1252
00:46:50,820 --> 00:46:52,820
(Laughter)

1253
00:46:52,820 --> 00:46:54,820
(Laughter)

1254
00:46:54,820 --> 00:46:56,820
If I get paraplegiarized

1255
00:46:56,820 --> 00:46:58,820
and my legs go

1256
00:46:58,820 --> 00:47:00,820
they're unusable

1257
00:47:00,820 --> 00:47:02,820
First of all I will get the arm strength like daredevil

1258
00:47:02,820 --> 00:47:04,820
that will come instantly

1259
00:47:04,820 --> 00:47:06,820
Will you be one of these people who walks around on their hands?

1260
00:47:06,820 --> 00:47:08,820
Even better, what I'm gonna do is

1261
00:47:08,820 --> 00:47:10,820
I will tie my lower body to a pogo stick

1262
00:47:10,820 --> 00:47:12,820
(Laughter)

1263
00:47:12,820 --> 00:47:19,620
Only my giant buff arm instantly got strung by the daredevil effect. I'll walk or I'll jump around on that. Yeah

1264
00:47:19,620 --> 00:47:24,600
They'll call me they'll call me Cameron in the box. They won't know they have a

1265
00:47:24,600 --> 00:47:27,900
Common that it happens to me. They'll call me LD abloh

1266
00:47:27,900 --> 00:47:37,380
In Diablo Blanco, yeah, do you know they have extreme pogo?

1267
00:47:38,340 --> 00:47:42,540
No, they hit like like skateboarding and like BMX. Oh

1268
00:47:42,540 --> 00:47:50,580
That's such a big dudes jumping off of like buildings and then like doing like front flips with the handle

1269
00:47:50,580 --> 00:47:56,940
BMX is already bad. Oh, you really you can't stray any further and also the also they do it with unicycles

1270
00:47:56,940 --> 00:47:58,580
Yeah

1271
00:47:58,580 --> 00:48:04,080
But it's just too easy to honk and drive by extreme pogo and say extreme homo

1272
00:48:04,080 --> 00:48:11,080
It's too they shouldn't call it that well guess what what they also could they also have that

1273
00:48:11,080 --> 00:48:15,680
Homos they have extreme homos. It's already - it's extreme jumping. Yeah

1274
00:48:15,680 --> 00:48:20,960
What just extreme jumping? Yeah, that's fine. Yeah, just get rid of the pogo stick

1275
00:48:20,960 --> 00:48:25,560
They have extreme homo just jump around those contests are crazy. I don't think so

1276
00:48:25,560 --> 00:48:28,920
Roll the clip

1277
00:48:28,920 --> 00:48:31,960
Don't find it don't roll

1278
00:48:31,960 --> 00:48:32,960
Extreme homo.

1279
00:48:32,960 --> 00:48:33,960
Don't do it.

1280
00:48:33,960 --> 00:48:34,960
No, don't look at it.

1281
00:48:34,960 --> 00:48:35,960
No, don't look at it.

1282
00:48:35,960 --> 00:48:36,960
I don't want to see that.

1283
00:48:36,960 --> 00:48:37,960
I don't want to see that.

1284
00:48:37,960 --> 00:48:38,960
It's not our place to look that up.

1285
00:48:38,960 --> 00:48:39,960
Dubio just has that on his computer.

1286
00:48:39,960 --> 00:48:40,960
Extreme homo.

1287
00:48:40,960 --> 00:48:41,960
Roll it.

1288
00:48:41,960 --> 00:48:42,960
You've already got it.

1289
00:48:42,960 --> 00:48:43,960
You've got it queued up the whole time.

1290
00:48:43,960 --> 00:48:44,960
You've got it in OBS already to go.

1291
00:48:44,960 --> 00:48:45,960
Do you guys want to get into an extreme sport together?

1292
00:48:45,960 --> 00:48:46,960
You said that you wanted to learn how to ollie this year and you still have not hit it.

1293
00:48:46,960 --> 00:48:47,960
I'm going to try to get into an extreme sport together.

1294
00:48:47,960 --> 00:48:48,960
I'm going to try to get into an extreme sport together.

1295
00:48:48,960 --> 00:48:49,960
I'm going to try to get into an extreme sport together.

1296
00:48:49,960 --> 00:48:50,960
I'm going to try to get into an extreme sport together.

1297
00:48:50,960 --> 00:48:51,800
- There you go.

1298
00:48:51,800 --> 00:48:54,600
(laughing)

1299
00:48:54,600 --> 00:48:58,040
Do you guys wanna do, get into an extreme sport together?

1300
00:48:58,040 --> 00:49:01,320
- You said that you wanted to learn how to ollie this year

1301
00:49:01,320 --> 00:49:03,460
and you still have not hit me up.

1302
00:49:03,460 --> 00:49:04,400
- I don't even remember saying that.

1303
00:49:04,400 --> 00:49:05,800
- You said it on an episode.

1304
00:49:05,800 --> 00:49:07,320
- He got so excited when I said that,

1305
00:49:07,320 --> 00:49:09,680
that you put that so sweet, that you remembered that.

1306
00:49:09,680 --> 00:49:12,600
- Both of you, I think, 'cause I remember the conversation

1307
00:49:12,600 --> 00:49:15,040
was he's gonna learn it before you.

1308
00:49:15,040 --> 00:49:16,280
- Oh, there's no way.

1309
00:49:16,280 --> 00:49:17,320
- Don't remember that.

1310
00:49:17,320 --> 00:49:18,760
- I'm an expert at learning.

1311
00:49:18,760 --> 00:49:20,800
I'm a fast learner, fast learner.

1312
00:49:20,800 --> 00:49:25,400
I mean I have like four skateboards at home. We can just go try this. Yeah, I'm down

1313
00:49:25,400 --> 00:49:28,900
We could go film this right now cut the episode here. We film

1314
00:49:28,900 --> 00:49:32,640
15 minutes

1315
00:49:32,640 --> 00:49:41,580
Not to mention a pandemic yeah, yeah good point I was thinking earlier. I think that he's afraid I'm not afraid

1316
00:49:41,580 --> 00:49:47,120
I did why I did an Ollie one time in high school, but it wasn't not a good one, but I did one before

1317
00:49:47,160 --> 00:49:51,920
He's learning to drive so he's he's already in do oh yeah, cuz he's the extreme sport

1318
00:49:51,920 --> 00:49:55,080
He's about yeah, too is way crazier. This is my version of

1319
00:49:55,080 --> 00:50:01,220
Learning to drive is learning to skateboard. Yeah, because I think that I just have such a skateboarders brain

1320
00:50:01,220 --> 00:50:04,880
Mmm. I don't think you look at the world the way that escape does I do

1321
00:50:04,880 --> 00:50:09,480
Cuz I look around I say fuck that fuck that and fuck you to you old bitch

1322
00:50:09,480 --> 00:50:14,920
To grannies and grandpas. I'm going fuck you. I'm a skateboarder. That's right. I disrespect you

1323
00:50:14,920 --> 00:50:16,920
I'd be graffiti on me.

1324
00:50:16,920 --> 00:50:19,920
I'm gonna smash your front door in and come in your house and get you.

1325
00:50:19,920 --> 00:50:20,920
Yeah.

1326
00:50:20,920 --> 00:50:22,920
I'm gonna pin you down and feed you.

1327
00:50:22,920 --> 00:50:24,920
Food.

1328
00:50:24,920 --> 00:50:26,920
I'm installing a trough in your house.

1329
00:50:26,920 --> 00:50:29,920
I'm gonna find you, granny, and I'm gonna pin you down and feed you food.

1330
00:50:29,920 --> 00:50:32,920
This is me at the front wall of your house.

1331
00:50:32,920 --> 00:50:34,920
I'm like, "Bam! Bam! Bam!"

1332
00:50:34,920 --> 00:50:37,920
Until it splinters. I'm coming in through the drywall.

1333
00:50:37,920 --> 00:50:39,920
I'm knocking down your door with my--

1334
00:50:39,920 --> 00:50:40,920
And you might say--

1335
00:50:40,920 --> 00:50:43,920
I'm kicking the door down, and I got a bowl of oatmeal in my hand.

1336
00:50:43,920 --> 00:50:45,700
And I'm like grandma

1337
00:50:45,700 --> 00:50:50,900
Welcome to your fucking nightmare you think and when I say I'm smashing it through the drywall you might think oh like the kool-aid man

1338
00:50:50,900 --> 00:50:53,660
But no, I'm not doing it like the cool coming in bit by bit first

1339
00:50:53,660 --> 00:50:59,500
That's my hand then my foot. I was like a demon climbing out of the mirror world. Yeah, okay, and I'm not leaving gradually

1340
00:50:59,500 --> 00:51:01,500
I'm not leaving

1341
00:51:01,500 --> 00:51:07,800
I have my face painted like sting from the WWE mm-hmm, and I might but painted like Darth Maul

1342
00:51:07,800 --> 00:51:12,900
Yep, and by the way when I break through the door it's your butt. It's gonna be like Homer's makeup shotgun

1343
00:51:12,900 --> 00:51:14,260
(laughing)

1344
00:51:14,260 --> 00:51:16,260
- You're gonna have Darth Maul's face.

1345
00:51:16,260 --> 00:51:17,780
- Yeah, you're gonna have Darth Maul's paint on your face.

1346
00:51:17,780 --> 00:51:19,060
- And then, by the way, legally,

1347
00:51:19,060 --> 00:51:21,100
if you look like Darth Maul,

1348
00:51:21,100 --> 00:51:22,740
I can legally do whatever I want.

1349
00:51:22,740 --> 00:51:24,860
Because nobody's gonna, everybody's gonna be like--

1350
00:51:24,860 --> 00:51:25,700
- I'm a lightsaber.

1351
00:51:25,700 --> 00:51:26,980
- Oh thank God, Darth Maul.

1352
00:51:26,980 --> 00:51:28,740
Oh thank God he died.

1353
00:51:28,740 --> 00:51:30,420
Oh thank God somebody cut Darth Maul's head off.

1354
00:51:30,420 --> 00:51:32,080
- Darth Maul came to the real world

1355
00:51:32,080 --> 00:51:34,140
and someone chopped his fucking legs off.

1356
00:51:34,140 --> 00:51:35,900
Be careful.

1357
00:51:35,900 --> 00:51:38,740
Be careful, he's gonna get some spider legs.

1358
00:51:38,740 --> 00:51:40,700
- That's what I would do.

1359
00:51:40,700 --> 00:51:42,580
- Darth Maul came to the real world.

1360
00:51:42,580 --> 00:51:44,580
Someone chopped his fucking legs off.

1361
00:51:44,580 --> 00:51:50,260
If I saw somebody walking around in Darth Maul makeup, I would be like, "There's a 50/50

1362
00:51:50,260 --> 00:51:51,780
I chop his legs off and it's good."

1363
00:51:51,780 --> 00:51:52,780
You have to kill him.

1364
00:51:52,780 --> 00:51:53,780
Yeah, I have to try.

1365
00:51:53,780 --> 00:51:56,420
Because if you chop his legs off, chop his head off, right?

1366
00:51:56,420 --> 00:51:59,140
The investigator finds it, face down, right?

1367
00:51:59,140 --> 00:52:00,140
Picks it up.

1368
00:52:00,140 --> 00:52:01,140
"Ahh!

1369
00:52:01,140 --> 00:52:02,140
Oh my god, it's Darth Maul!"

1370
00:52:02,140 --> 00:52:03,140
Fuck you, bastard.

1371
00:52:03,140 --> 00:52:04,140
Kick his head into the Hudson River.

1372
00:52:04,140 --> 00:52:05,140
That's right, some hero just killed Darth Maul.

1373
00:52:05,140 --> 00:52:08,460
Get the fuck out of the real world, Darth Maul!

1374
00:52:08,460 --> 00:52:10,020
Go back to your imaginary world.

1375
00:52:10,020 --> 00:52:11,020
Go back to Tatooine!

1376
00:52:11,020 --> 00:52:16,380
If you don't go back to

1377
00:52:16,380 --> 00:52:35,780
You're in line for like the next Star Wars movie there's a guy dressed up like Darth Maul there do Darth Maul

1378
00:52:35,780 --> 00:52:41,560
I'm gonna slap the makeup off his face now fucking insensitive to be to dress up like Darth Maul

1379
00:52:41,560 --> 00:52:46,780
Yeah, I literally a movie whose main characters probably got into conflicts against Darth Maul

1380
00:52:46,780 --> 00:52:52,620
He's not even in the movies. He dies at the end of the Obi-Wan series or no. It's Star Wars rebels

1381
00:52:52,620 --> 00:52:55,260
He dies then there's a whole thing

1382
00:52:55,260 --> 00:53:01,660
There was a there is a guy when I saw I saw force awakens like the premiered night of got to the movie theater

1383
00:53:02,180 --> 00:53:07,260
Like two hours early. I don't know why the fuck I did that smoked a bunch of weed and then

1384
00:53:07,260 --> 00:53:13,500
Guy there dressed up like Darth Maul and I was so high and scared that I was just staring at him

1385
00:53:13,500 --> 00:53:15,940
And he asked me if I wanted to take a picture and I went

1386
00:53:15,940 --> 00:53:20,060
Yeah, don't ever ask me that again

1387
00:53:20,060 --> 00:53:22,300
He sat directly in front of me too

1388
00:53:22,300 --> 00:53:26,900
So I fell asleep in the theater woke up and looked if I saw you fell asleep opening night

1389
00:53:26,900 --> 00:53:29,580
I'm walking through the entire line for the Star Wars

1390
00:53:30,340 --> 00:53:32,340
Midnight showing I'm sorry

1391
00:53:32,340 --> 00:53:34,380
So we meet again Darth Maul

1392
00:53:34,380 --> 00:53:41,260
It appears for your legs to be shot again. You've decided to enter your wrong world

1393
00:53:41,260 --> 00:53:48,000
And I think by now this is the fourth time and you know that the punishment is your legs are will be gone

1394
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:51,200
and I will be kicking your head into a

1395
00:53:51,200 --> 00:53:58,020
Radio show I walk around to third with the chopper, and I'm not talking a gun. Yeah, I will chop

1396
00:53:58,020 --> 00:53:59,020
I have a choppa.

1397
00:53:59,020 --> 00:54:00,020
I've got your blizzy.

1398
00:54:00,020 --> 00:54:01,020
Mm-hmm.

1399
00:54:01,020 --> 00:54:02,020
Yeah.

1400
00:54:02,020 --> 00:54:03,020
Blade.

1401
00:54:03,020 --> 00:54:04,020
That's a blizzy blade.

1402
00:54:04,020 --> 00:54:07,020
Did you guys see that Disney made a real-life lightsaber?

1403
00:54:07,020 --> 00:54:08,020
Yeah.

1404
00:54:08,020 --> 00:54:09,020
I didn't watch the video, but it because I...

1405
00:54:09,020 --> 00:54:12,020
They need to back the fuck off because they're in too many markets.

1406
00:54:12,020 --> 00:54:18,020
They have a monopoly on theme parks, animated TV shows, live-action TV shows, live-action

1407
00:54:18,020 --> 00:54:22,020
movies, animated movies, hybrid live-action and animated...

1408
00:54:22,020 --> 00:54:23,020
4D animated ride.

1409
00:54:23,020 --> 00:54:27,020
CG effects, CG effects, 4D animated ride, animated movies that play during rides.

1410
00:54:27,020 --> 00:54:28,280
- Driving rides. - Band-Aids.

1411
00:54:28,280 --> 00:54:29,120
- And now they're trying to get into weapons.

1412
00:54:29,120 --> 00:54:29,960
- Cruise ships.

1413
00:54:29,960 --> 00:54:32,400
- Band-Aids, children's toys, snacks.

1414
00:54:32,400 --> 00:54:34,200
- Leave the lightsabers to Apple.

1415
00:54:34,200 --> 00:54:35,160
'Cause you know they're gonna make

1416
00:54:35,160 --> 00:54:36,840
the fire-ass lightsaber.

1417
00:54:36,840 --> 00:54:37,680
- Well you know they're all owned by one company, right?

1418
00:54:37,680 --> 00:54:40,840
- I don't want some busted fucking Dell lightsaber.

1419
00:54:40,840 --> 00:54:42,280
(laughing)

1420
00:54:42,280 --> 00:54:44,000
- We need Apple to come out with a white one.

1421
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:45,040
- Yeah, that's right.

1422
00:54:45,040 --> 00:54:47,960
Yeah, I'm like, "Mom, don't buy me this fucking Dell."

1423
00:54:47,960 --> 00:54:49,840
- Yeah, this whack-ass lightsaber.

1424
00:54:49,840 --> 00:54:52,040
It's got stickers all over it and shit.

1425
00:54:52,040 --> 00:54:53,920
- Lenovo. - Man, fuck kids.

1426
00:54:53,920 --> 00:54:55,760
- Fuck you, Mom, I don't want this Alienware.

1427
00:54:55,760 --> 00:54:56,600
I want a MacBook.

1428
00:54:56,600 --> 00:54:57,440
- Nah!

1429
00:54:57,440 --> 00:54:59,800
This thing looks like shit.

1430
00:54:59,800 --> 00:55:01,480
- This actually-- - This gateway ass.

1431
00:55:01,480 --> 00:55:05,520
- Your mom buying you an elegant Alienware gaming PC.

1432
00:55:05,520 --> 00:55:07,280
Fuck you mom, I want a fucking MacBook.

1433
00:55:07,280 --> 00:55:09,360
- I wanna do graphic design, mom.

1434
00:55:09,360 --> 00:55:11,000
What the F is this thing?

1435
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:12,720
- What the flip? - What the flip?

1436
00:55:12,720 --> 00:55:14,160
- What the flip, mom?

1437
00:55:14,160 --> 00:55:15,120
- You can't swear, mom.

1438
00:55:15,120 --> 00:55:16,720
- No, yo. - I was never allowed

1439
00:55:16,720 --> 00:55:18,080
to swear, mom. - You can't have 64 gigs

1440
00:55:18,080 --> 00:55:20,400
of RAM, no, mom. - No, I want 12.

1441
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:22,000
- I want 12. - 512 megabytes.

1442
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:23,920
- And wait, how much did you pay, 1,000 bucks?

1443
00:55:23,920 --> 00:55:26,440
- Double it, bitch. - I did a RAM upgrade

1444
00:55:26,440 --> 00:55:30,840
on my laptop and I don't see it. I guess I don't know what happened, but somehow now

1445
00:55:30,840 --> 00:55:35,080
my computer has an odd number of RAM. It has like 23 gigs of RAM.

1446
00:55:35,080 --> 00:55:36,240
Really? That's what it says?

1447
00:55:36,240 --> 00:55:36,760
Yeah.

1448
00:55:36,760 --> 00:55:38,240
So that makes no sense.

1449
00:55:38,240 --> 00:55:41,440
It literally makes, it's like 23.7 or something.

1450
00:55:41,440 --> 00:55:44,000
It's probably, were you trying to put 24 in?

1451
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:51,000
No, I put in 16 maybe. I think, well I already had 8 and I think I put in, I don't remember,

1452
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:54,000
I think I put in 16 more. And it says like 23.

1453
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:56,800
Well, what's 8 plus 16? That's 24.

1454
00:55:56,800 --> 00:55:59,060
(laughter)

1455
00:55:59,060 --> 00:56:03,400
That was fire.

1456
00:56:03,400 --> 00:56:04,360
Yeah.

1457
00:56:04,360 --> 00:56:06,400
Yeah, maybe I even put in 30, no,

1458
00:56:06,400 --> 00:56:10,080
'cause it must be something different because some--

1459
00:56:10,080 --> 00:56:12,080
I think that you were creating a bomb accidentally.

1460
00:56:12,080 --> 00:56:13,560
I think, yeah, well, I'm just worried

1461
00:56:13,560 --> 00:56:15,240
that something's gonna happen down the line

1462
00:56:15,240 --> 00:56:16,480
that I'm not expecting. It's going to.

1463
00:56:16,480 --> 00:56:17,640
Yeah, you should not have that.

1464
00:56:17,640 --> 00:56:19,480
That's usually my worry about most things,

1465
00:56:19,480 --> 00:56:20,640
is that something's going to happen.

1466
00:56:20,640 --> 00:56:25,640
I think that I've only ever seen RAM be 8, 16, 32, 64, 128.

1467
00:56:25,640 --> 00:56:29,840
I've never heard of 23.7 gigs of RAM.

1468
00:56:29,840 --> 00:56:30,680
That's a good amount of RAM though.

1469
00:56:30,680 --> 00:56:32,200
That's why I was confused.

1470
00:56:32,200 --> 00:56:34,200
I mean, it's definitely a lot of RAM.

1471
00:56:34,200 --> 00:56:35,400
What the fuck is RAM?

1472
00:56:35,400 --> 00:56:36,680
Random access memory.

1473
00:56:36,680 --> 00:56:38,640
Okay, Daft Punk, motherfucker.

1474
00:56:38,640 --> 00:56:40,360
Yeah, that's why I wanted to say it.

1475
00:56:40,360 --> 00:56:42,080
Okay, you robotic dancer.

1476
00:56:42,080 --> 00:56:43,080
Like the Legend of the Phoenix.

1477
00:56:43,080 --> 00:56:43,920
Robot flop.

1478
00:56:43,920 --> 00:56:45,680
They are robots.

1479
00:56:45,680 --> 00:56:47,920
(laughing)

1480
00:56:47,920 --> 00:56:53,460
You guys, so on our next tour, we should hit Ibiza, I think.

1481
00:56:53,460 --> 00:56:54,860
Yeah, Ibiza.

1482
00:56:54,860 --> 00:56:55,860
Ibiza.

1483
00:56:55,860 --> 00:56:58,660
And get some kind of very long drink.

1484
00:56:58,660 --> 00:56:59,660
Oh.

1485
00:56:59,660 --> 00:57:03,700
And we should do like what Zach Bagans does and try to contact Avicii.

1486
00:57:03,700 --> 00:57:06,660
Like, oh my God.

1487
00:57:06,660 --> 00:57:07,660
That is a good idea.

1488
00:57:07,660 --> 00:57:10,260
I would love to try to contact, to trap him.

1489
00:57:10,260 --> 00:57:11,260
Oh my God.

1490
00:57:11,260 --> 00:57:12,780
I would put him into like a genie lamp.

1491
00:57:12,780 --> 00:57:17,060
Hologram Avicii and we can just have him like remix us every day.

1492
00:57:17,060 --> 00:57:22,420
the thing I'd put them into like I put them into that I do our zoom and I'd say

1493
00:57:22,420 --> 00:57:26,460
now pump out some I'd swallow them and I download stuff into it I'd be downloading

1494
00:57:26,460 --> 00:57:33,780
do a leap song yeah it's all him

1495
00:57:33,780 --> 00:57:42,940
yeah well I'd actually want the Skrillex remix well that's the thing is I would I

1496
00:57:42,940 --> 00:57:45,820
I would change up. He looks like white Drake now.

1497
00:57:45,820 --> 00:57:48,260
Really? What do you think? It looks like white Drake.

1498
00:57:48,260 --> 00:57:48,740
Looks like white.

1499
00:57:48,740 --> 00:57:50,340
For real? Can you show me Skrillex?

1500
00:57:50,340 --> 00:57:51,700
Skrillex now.

1501
00:57:51,700 --> 00:57:53,980
You just searched Skrillex.

1502
00:57:53,980 --> 00:57:55,660
Well, he does look like white Drake a little bit.

1503
00:57:55,660 --> 00:57:56,460
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

1504
00:57:56,460 --> 00:57:57,460
See right there.

1505
00:57:57,460 --> 00:57:59,060
He looks like a chef.

1506
00:57:59,060 --> 00:58:01,500
He looks like a chef. I hate it.

1507
00:58:01,500 --> 00:58:02,660
Yeah. Isn't that sad?

1508
00:58:02,660 --> 00:58:04,460
Yeah. I mean, it makes sense.

1509
00:58:04,460 --> 00:58:06,580
And now he makes music with Blade and it doesn't go

1510
00:58:06,580 --> 00:58:08,420
instead anymore.

1511
00:58:08,420 --> 00:58:10,140
Yeah. He had to change his shit up.

1512
00:58:10,140 --> 00:58:12,180
But change his shit up entirely and completely.

1513
00:58:12,300 --> 00:58:16,600
I used to pretend to hate Skrillex, but that song "Bangarang"

1514
00:58:16,600 --> 00:58:18,600
He made some amazing music.

1515
00:58:18,600 --> 00:58:20,600
I think Skrillex was cool.

1516
00:58:20,600 --> 00:58:23,720
When I was younger, I was like, "Man, fuck this gay ass dubstep bullshit."

1517
00:58:23,720 --> 00:58:25,720
Now that I'm a grown man, I fully appreciate it.

1518
00:58:25,720 --> 00:58:27,720
Interesting.

1519
00:58:27,720 --> 00:58:29,720
Now that I'm a grown man, I have a taste for classical.

1520
00:58:29,720 --> 00:58:31,720
Really?

1521
00:58:31,720 --> 00:58:33,720
Dubstep.

1522
00:58:33,720 --> 00:58:35,720
So what have you been listening to recently?

1523
00:58:35,720 --> 00:58:37,720
Skrillex.

1524
00:58:37,720 --> 00:58:39,720
That's not classical. I mean classical.

1525
00:58:39,720 --> 00:58:41,720
He's listening to Venetian Snares.

1526
00:58:41,720 --> 00:58:47,560
named Avicii. You could convince me that that was an Italian composer, but it's out of a

1527
00:58:47,560 --> 00:58:54,380
German drug addict. Yeah. Germany is Swiss. Fuck him. He's dead. Switzerland. A German

1528
00:58:54,380 --> 00:59:00,880
drug addict is what a Swedish guy is. That's what most German, if you're like, in German,

1529
00:59:00,880 --> 00:59:10,040
if you say like American, it's like Americanish. I think that entire area... Germany? No, not

1530
00:59:10,040 --> 00:59:14,200
Germany, but like Sweden, Norway, all that kind of stuff.

1531
00:59:14,200 --> 00:59:17,000
The Scandinavians, wipe it off the map.

1532
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:20,160
Then where would all of my amazing particle board furniture go?

1533
00:59:20,160 --> 00:59:24,040
Don't need any of those places. All of those places are terrible.

1534
00:59:24,040 --> 00:59:27,720
And the fact that they all have different languages just pisses me off.

1535
00:59:27,720 --> 00:59:31,680
If we're talking about different countries, can I close this out with a message?

1536
00:59:31,680 --> 00:59:32,180
Yeah.

1537
00:59:32,180 --> 00:59:34,020
An important message.

1538
00:59:34,020 --> 00:59:44,020
So I am headed, at the end of the month, I'm headed to Mexico for my American-ish friends.

1539
00:59:44,020 --> 00:59:46,020
He's going to find the chupacabra.

1540
00:59:46,020 --> 00:59:51,020
I'm not going to find the chupacabra, but I have an important message here that is actually really important.

1541
00:59:51,020 --> 00:59:55,020
This is a message to the cartel of Mexico.

1542
00:59:55,020 --> 00:59:59,020
Speak directly into the camera. GBO, maybe you could pass this along.

1543
00:59:59,020 --> 01:00:01,060
Yeah, that would be great if you could pass along.

1544
01:00:01,060 --> 01:00:03,560
To the cartel, I've seen what you guys have been doing,

1545
01:00:03,560 --> 01:00:04,680
I've seen what you're up to,

1546
01:00:04,680 --> 01:00:07,140
and this is a warning right now

1547
01:00:07,140 --> 01:00:09,480
to get your affairs in order, okay?

1548
01:00:09,480 --> 01:00:13,120
Because unless you shoot my plane out of the fucking sky,

1549
01:00:13,120 --> 01:00:15,420
you guys are done.

1550
01:00:15,420 --> 01:00:18,780
And I'll be dropping my flight number

1551
01:00:18,780 --> 01:00:21,540
on the morning of my flight, so check my Twitter page.

1552
01:00:21,540 --> 01:00:23,020
I dare you to fucking try.

1553
01:00:23,020 --> 01:00:24,020
Take me down.

1554
01:00:24,020 --> 01:00:24,980
It's not happening.

1555
01:00:24,980 --> 01:00:28,340
I'm coming there and I'm cleaning y'all up.

1556
01:00:28,340 --> 01:00:29,660
you're gonna be screaming for help.

1557
01:00:29,660 --> 01:00:32,700
What you did to those American tourists

1558
01:00:32,700 --> 01:00:35,100
and the industry you perpetuate with the drugs,

1559
01:00:35,100 --> 01:00:37,900
the sex trafficking, I don't know if you do sex trafficking,

1560
01:00:37,900 --> 01:00:38,740
maybe you do.

1561
01:00:38,740 --> 01:00:40,340
- Yeah.

1562
01:00:40,340 --> 01:00:42,740
- It ends on March 30th.

1563
01:00:42,740 --> 01:00:46,360
And that's a promise.

1564
01:00:46,360 --> 01:00:50,100
That's all I need to let them know.

1565
01:00:50,100 --> 01:00:53,140
- There will be a video that's like a slow fade

1566
01:00:53,140 --> 01:00:54,620
of just your head on a pipe.

1567
01:00:54,620 --> 01:00:56,820
(laughing)

1568
01:00:56,820 --> 01:00:59,500
- Your head is like, your head's a grill ornament

1569
01:00:59,500 --> 01:01:01,060
for like a GMC truck.

1570
01:01:01,060 --> 01:01:02,720
- You're gonna be one of the guys

1571
01:01:02,720 --> 01:01:04,240
that they don't even kill for money,

1572
01:01:04,240 --> 01:01:05,980
they just like practice on you.

1573
01:01:05,980 --> 01:01:07,660
- Yeah, you're somebody's like--

1574
01:01:07,660 --> 01:01:08,620
- I'd like to see them try.

1575
01:01:08,620 --> 01:01:10,740
- You're somebody's blood in, blood out thing.

1576
01:01:10,740 --> 01:01:11,580
- Exactly.

1577
01:01:11,580 --> 01:01:13,380
- Like you're like, yeah, you have to go,

1578
01:01:13,380 --> 01:01:16,300
if you wanna join, you have to shoot that guy.

1579
01:01:16,300 --> 01:01:17,940
- They will have decided to kill you

1580
01:01:17,940 --> 01:01:19,620
30 seconds before they saw you.

1581
01:01:19,620 --> 01:01:21,860
- No, no, no, no, it's not, Ninja Stars,

1582
01:01:21,860 --> 01:01:22,680
that's all I'm saying.

1583
01:01:22,680 --> 01:01:23,520
- We do have a Ninja Star you can bring.

1584
01:01:23,520 --> 01:01:24,340
- We do have a Ninja Star.

1585
01:01:24,340 --> 01:01:25,180
- All right, bye guys.

1586
01:01:25,180 --> 01:01:26,020
- Bye bye.

1587
01:01:26,020 --> 01:01:28,020
Shareholder meeting.

1588
01:01:28,020 --> 01:01:30,020
Shareholder meeting March 22nd.

1589
01:01:30,020 --> 01:01:32,020
And then Cameron's going to be in Mexico.

1590
01:01:32,020 --> 01:01:34,020
And then you're going to be in...

1591
01:01:34,020 --> 01:01:36,020
I'll be in Raleigh.

1592
01:01:36,020 --> 01:01:38,020
The 23rd through the 25th.

1593
01:01:38,020 --> 01:01:40,020
And then I'm going to be doing a

1594
01:01:40,020 --> 01:01:42,020
bunch of bar shows.

1595
01:01:42,020 --> 01:01:44,020
Awesome.

1596
01:01:44,020 --> 01:01:46,020
If you're in Brooklyn, look for me.

1597
01:01:46,020 --> 01:01:48,020
Oh!

1598
01:01:48,020 --> 01:01:50,020
(laughter)

1599
01:01:50,020 --> 01:01:52,020
Flump.

1600
01:01:52,020 --> 01:01:54,020
Did your tooth chip?
