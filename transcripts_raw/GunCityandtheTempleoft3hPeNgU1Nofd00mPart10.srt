00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,600
[MUSIC]

2
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:10,640
Last time on Gun City!

3
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:18,880
Our heroes were attacked on the train by a seemingly endless parade of Ken Bone guards from Gadsfield.

4
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:27,520
This insurmountable fight grew increasingly surmountable once Leroy Peanutbutter and his gang of roving Ken Bone hobos took the opportunity,

5
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:31,520
provided by Sullivan's flubbing to stage a train revolution.

6
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:35,520
Thinking quickly, Blowtoss Pisc teleported the gang above the train,

7
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:38,520
where they were greeted by a very angry King Gad,

8
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:42,520
whose mech was poised to obliterate the group.

9
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:46,520
Knowing all he loves is improv and musical theatre,

10
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:50,520
the crew sang and danced to the best of their ability in a desperate plea for their life.

11
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:55,520
Rolling a natural 20, Sullivan the Frog was like a regular Ricky Martin,

12
00:00:55,520 --> 00:01:02,240
and King Gadd spared them if he could quote-unquote have Sullivan. This, as a

13
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:06,840
successful rebellion from Leroy's train hobos, meant the group could successfully

14
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:10,440
arrive in Who-town, not to be confused with Whoville.

15
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:15,880
Bloatoss Piss had a somewhat existential crisis, realizing he was just one of many

16
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:20,360
Who's, but not so existential that it prevented the gang from meeting with the

17
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:23,040
The Ku-Guru suck-ass shit.

18
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:25,560
They sang the sacred "Kiki, do you love me?"

19
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:30,640
chant, leading to a panoramic vision of all of Tamagotchi Empire's history.

20
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:35,840
By the end of it, they knew the temple was through the Christmas jungle.

21
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:40,120
Barreling through said jungle, the boys plus Snoochie Boochies bullied penguins with VR

22
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:44,360
headsets attached to their heads until they arrived at the incredible sight.

23
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:46,040
At last.

24
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:51,040
the sight of the template of the Penguin of Dune.

25
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:56,040
And so you guys are standing before this massive golden penguin.

26
00:01:56,040 --> 00:02:04,040
It looks like the golden penguin statue you had, you'd gotten from the land caves.

27
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:15,040
And it also has a similar vagina front, despite Joey's amazing drawing.

28
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:21,660
I should have told him that detail, but I didn't want to I wanted to make sure the poster could be you know on things

29
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:30,900
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, so and also got the staircase

30
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:35,560
Yep

31
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:40,560
And yeah the the and the the

32
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:44,360
The temple itself is like massive, you know

33
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:50,440
It's like 300 feet by 300 feet probably and the outside is like shimmering gold if goal had any

34
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:52,800
Admit any value in gun city. This would be

35
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:56,020
Worth a whole army of wild stray dogs

36
00:02:56,020 --> 00:03:05,020
The light sky reflecting off this massive structure could blind you and will actually make way ray william johnson take 1d 6 damage for

37
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:10,920
that he stands. I really wish I hadn't brought that up out of nowhere for no reason.

38
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:14,920
Me too for your sake, pal. You do. Your favorite thing is to make yourself take damage.

39
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:22,120
Okay, one. So yeah, the light reflects off of it and like sort of crests across your chest

40
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:27,220
and you take one damage. Okay, I start standing behind Solomon.

41
00:03:27,220 --> 00:03:32,820
Every time Caleb's character takes damage, his heart pumps one pump worth of blood into his penis.

42
00:03:32,820 --> 00:03:35,940
that is true

43
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:38,700
are just excited to see me or

44
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:41,180
why aren't you covering me you're too small

45
00:03:41,180 --> 00:03:42,220
you could

46
00:03:42,220 --> 00:03:43,420
track i mean

47
00:03:43,420 --> 00:03:44,980
blowtoss is like

48
00:03:44,980 --> 00:03:49,780
pretty much a ten-year can you just get bigger for once

49
00:03:49,780 --> 00:03:53,340
well it's all in that stretch him out i'm gonna stretch you out like a lot of

50
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:54,060
the

51
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:55,340
well i don't know

52
00:03:55,340 --> 00:03:57,900
sullivan way to help you out before we do

53
00:03:57,900 --> 00:04:07,400
Before we do anything that relates to the quest we're on or anything, I think that a lot of the struggles we've been having with Sullivan would be solved if he was just normal size.

54
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:14,900
So I think we should maybe leave this temple and go find a wizard or a plastic surgeon.

55
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:17,900
Oh, the stretcher! I saw the stretcher back in Hootown!

56
00:04:17,900 --> 00:04:22,900
Yeah, exactly. So I think we're gonna go back through the Christmas jungle, back to Hootown.

57
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:26,900
They have to have like a bigging machine there, right?

58
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:38,780
the

59
00:04:38,780 --> 00:04:58,500
a

60
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:01,000
a lot like mary poppins doesn't it's really about it

61
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,180
it's a little bit of a little bit make it worse

62
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:04,260
everyone in this

63
00:05:04,260 --> 00:05:07,340
temples gonna think he's fuckin mary poppins i don't want it

64
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:11,180
i want to start talking as can be for three wishes do that i want that shit

65
00:05:11,180 --> 00:05:15,780
exactly how mary poppins was still a quick to get the which it was and i'm

66
00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:20,180
not a very popular for damage of

67
00:05:20,180 --> 00:05:21,780
in about a minute

68
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:23,100
all right

69
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:24,100
uh...

70
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:27,060
all right so i'm gonna get bigger my just got a bug in died

71
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:33,060
well i think you can take me to the stretcher

72
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:35,900
you and you can take a look

73
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:37,580
i know which way i'm leaning

74
00:05:37,580 --> 00:05:39,820
all in favor of the stretcher

75
00:05:39,820 --> 00:05:42,500
i and irish like it

76
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:43,940
so

77
00:05:43,940 --> 00:05:45,820
let's do it now

78
00:05:45,820 --> 00:05:49,220
now this is what let's do it

79
00:05:49,220 --> 00:05:50,260
this time

80
00:05:50,260 --> 00:05:57,540
I'm gonna destroy it. I'll see I look at the temple and I say I'll see you later. It wakes at you. Yes

81
00:05:57,540 --> 00:06:04,580
The stretcher in more ways than one if you think about it stretches the story out too. Yeah, it sure does

82
00:06:04,580 --> 00:06:08,740
Back through the christmas jungle

83
00:06:08,740 --> 00:06:11,220
You see like the penguins just like

84
00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:13,860
Like watching you all like leave

85
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:31,700
Stoogey Boogey's like just is sitting there waiting for you while the four of you go back sort of like a it's in a quest at a video game where all the people will just wait there for you to start the quest and you go back into the town to finish your last side quest to go to the stretcher.

86
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:36,500
You see this building that looks like a Whoville building, right?

87
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:39,500
But it's, which stretching makes sense, right?

88
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:42,700
It's sort of got the, it's kind of like the convex, it's got like a convex roof.

89
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:46,500
It's like a really small, it's like a ranch house almost, like stretched out.

90
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:54,900
And you see a guy walk out of the front door, who, it's first you see like his profile,

91
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:58,600
and then as he turns around and he turns out, he is like 10 feet wide,

92
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:01,500
and each eye is on each side of it.

93
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:05,000
And he's like, "I'm the stretcher!"

94
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Okay, I think I've changed my mind about seeing the stretcher.

95
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
I don't trust this guy at all.

96
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
This guy is really weird.

97
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Do you guys wanna... who needs to be stretched?

98
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:19,500
Hold on, do you do vertical stretching or is it just horizontal stretching?

99
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:21,000
Oh, hold on.

100
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,500
And he goes back inside.

101
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:25,500
And you see another thing. It looks like the top of someone's head.

102
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:27,500
And then when they bend up...

103
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:35,220
uh... higher there are a lot of people stretch it out with my brother had a

104
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:38,980
little bit like this guy a lot more and it's got to have a little bit of a

105
00:07:38,980 --> 00:07:41,840
statement you let you can have a swag

106
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:44,620
yes all done just a quick question

107
00:07:44,620 --> 00:07:47,580
do you want to do to do you want the diagonal brother

108
00:07:47,580 --> 00:07:53,520
no not the fact that nobody's really we need to do it do you do you have like a

109
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:55,880
grower or something in there

110
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:59,560
You do have like a bicycle pump or something?

111
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:04,520
Which of the two green ones are you trying to stretch?

112
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:05,960
The little one.

113
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:06,760
Why not both?

114
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:08,440
Wait, now that we're here.

115
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:10,280
No, I'm fine how I am.

116
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:11,080
Wait, no.

117
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:12,280
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

118
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:14,280
Let's get the horizontal stretcher back out here on Patrick.

119
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:16,920
If we're fucking asking this guy questions,

120
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:20,840
if you're gonna stretch me, I get to ask the fucking questions.

121
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:24,440
I'm slipping the stretcher guy some money to stretch Patrick.

122
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:28,320
Okay, wait, if you stretch me, am I gonna be two-dimensional?

123
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:36,320
No. So what will happen to you is that you will be an average height for a creature,

124
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:41,020
of, you know, regular-sized creature like your two other friends here.

125
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:47,320
Uh, this will lead to you suffering some ability changes.

126
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:50,320
Okay, I'm not gonna get stretched, but maybe we'll stretch Sullivan.

127
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:52,020
Can you turn me into a square?

128
00:08:52,020 --> 00:08:54,820
-Yeah, wait, can you make me smaller? -That would be...

129
00:08:54,820 --> 00:08:56,820
No, that's the shape in our next door.

130
00:08:56,820 --> 00:08:58,820
The Squishers are next door.

131
00:08:58,820 --> 00:09:00,820
They're a family of four.

132
00:09:00,820 --> 00:09:02,820
And they love squishing people.

133
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:06,820
If you wanted to squish, you can go there.

134
00:09:06,820 --> 00:09:08,820
Well, can you just like, is there any way that you could like,

135
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:13,820
lock the proportions of our frog friend and stretch him kind of both ways?

136
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:16,820
To be like, kind of the exact proportions of me?

137
00:09:16,820 --> 00:09:19,820
You want this deluxe stretching.

138
00:09:19,820 --> 00:09:21,820
How much is that going to run me?

139
00:09:21,820 --> 00:09:25,860
Of all three of us combined so he can kind of shade all three of us also

140
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:28,340
Could you make them less of a useless piece of shit?

141
00:09:28,340 --> 00:09:34,300
So I'm trying to get a discount if you do if you do

142
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:38,220
Stupid frog

143
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:46,020
Look I have to admit that there are side effects to all stretching sexual side effects

144
00:09:46,020 --> 00:09:49,180
Trust me. That's not gonna affect them. So

145
00:09:49,180 --> 00:09:55,900
I got some statue this campaign

146
00:10:16,340 --> 00:10:21,480
I need him to survive dude. I had to wear him like a like a snuggie. Oh

147
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:27,060
You want him to be now that I think about it? I could probably just get a snuggie

148
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:34,260
Is there a snuggler there's an outlet mall right next to this place

149
00:10:34,260 --> 00:10:40,100
It's got an s-scene on TV store. Yes. Everybody there is shaped like stores

150
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:45,520
You know what we'll just squish this little kid

151
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:52,520
it

152
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:55,920
now you keep it

153
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:58,260
now we give it to me

154
00:10:58,260 --> 00:11:00,800
you know or not my ass

155
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:02,100
and i can't do that

156
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:03,180
but

157
00:11:03,180 --> 00:11:06,300
i can stretch your ass so it looks like it has a horn

158
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:08,880
does good

159
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:10,080
it's got a hurt

160
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:11,880
uh... i love that

161
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:16,400
Okay, what if we just do that and go back to the temple? Yeah, that'll be good enough. Yeah

162
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:21,080
Solve all the problems kind of run really fast into the temple

163
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:28,080
Okay, let's just look at how much money. Do you guys have let me think I

164
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:32,360
Have every Xbox game if I trade I am

165
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:35,300
Let's see. Hold on. He's taking the trade

166
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:41,560
Right what do you know what I have every Xbox 360 game

167
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:49,600
Mmm. Wait a minute if I remember correctly didn't you shoot them all out the guy driving the car?

168
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:51,800
How do you God?

169
00:11:51,800 --> 00:12:00,160
What the fuck wait now that I'm looking at my inventory - I'm realizing is there maybe like a guy in this town that can turn?

170
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:03,720
lizard skin bones and penguin into a guy

171
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:06,280
That will follow my commands

172
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:10,280
I think this guy can do it.

173
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:14,280
Like if you like squish them together like and make like a guy.

174
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:18,280
Do you take... Is Minecraft Steve here?

175
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:22,280
Do you take American Express or Huge Worm?

176
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:26,280
I forgot you took a penguin.

177
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:30,280
I have lizard skin, bones and a penguin and I want to make him into a guy.

178
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:34,280
You need to go find Victor.

179
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:38,280
Victor von frankenstein.

180
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:40,280

181
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:41,280
Yeah.

182
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:45,280
It's an old hat, but you know, it still fits.

183
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:47,280
Is he living in this town?

184
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:50,280
Sure.

185
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:55,280
Cause if you say no, I'm gonna go to the other town and I'm gonna derail this even further.

186
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:57,280
Oh, I know.

187
00:12:57,280 --> 00:13:01,280

00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:16,400
like in making like little spires out of them okay

213
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:18,600

00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:22,240

00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:32,400
uh...

218
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:36,000
that you can use in the game, I'll say.

219
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,680
You should find creative ways to use it.

220
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:39,360
- I think I will. - It's a little harder

221
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:41,000
for you to walk, but it doesn't really affect

222
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,520
your total run speed, I'll say.

223
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:44,080
- Nice. - But yeah.

224
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:46,080
- Sitting down is probably a no-go, huh?

225
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:47,440
- No, you can't sit anymore.

226
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:48,240
- All right. - You're never getting

227
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:49,800
fucked in the ass again. - That's fine.

228
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:51,560
- Yeah. - Well, that's why I got it,

229
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:52,840
dude, is protection.

230
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:54,000
- All right, thank you.

231
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,800
I'm gonna go play with my iPod.

232
00:14:56,800 --> 00:15:00,480
- Can we redo this scene so that I walk by a storefront

233
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:05,480
that has a mannequin with two asshorns in the front and then I see it and I get an idea

234
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:07,920
and then I walk in and then I walk out with the asshorns.

235
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:09,800
Can we just say that's what happened?

236
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:12,120
Isn't that exactly what happened?

237
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:13,120
That's right.

238
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:14,120
Okay, cool.

239
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:20,520
Can I just leave my penguin and skin and bones with you and just come back some other time?

240
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:22,640
Why don't you just make the guy?

241
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:24,440
Do you want me to look after them or?

242
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:25,440
Just make a guy.

243
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:28,800
I mean, it shouldn't be that hard to make a guy.

244
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:35,800
you

245
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:36,920

bottle any uh...

296
00:17:46,380 --> 00:17:51,380
He goes up like a hill that looks like sort of the Grinch Hill like in Whoville.

297
00:17:51,380 --> 00:17:57,380
And you see there's like a tower up there that looks like a castle.

298
00:17:57,380 --> 00:18:04,380
You see lightning strike and you see him through the window and now he looks like Victor Frankenstein.

299
00:18:04,380 --> 00:18:05,380
He looks completely different.

300
00:18:05,380 --> 00:18:10,380
And you see his face like exaggerated combining these things together.

301
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:15,380
And he comes back down and he gives you his creation.

302
00:18:15,380 --> 00:18:23,780
and he says, uh, ZZ is something that I, well, what would you like to call it?

303
00:18:23,780 --> 00:18:33,380
And he shows you, it's a penguin that is a lot like broader shoulders now, from the bones,

304
00:18:33,380 --> 00:18:42,380
covered in like lizard skin, and then it has this water bottle, um, that is like melted onto its forehead,

305
00:18:42,380 --> 00:18:48,300
That holds a brain inside of you loading yo, I'm gonna call you Sullivan the frog

306
00:18:48,300 --> 00:18:59,460
All right, come on Sullivan, let's go back to the temple

307
00:18:59,460 --> 00:19:07,060
It's follows you around so be while Sullivan's there. Hey, wait, could you please call him just something else?

308
00:19:07,060 --> 00:19:09,060
Oh, that's my name. I

309
00:19:10,420 --> 00:19:11,420
I don't hear him.

310
00:19:11,420 --> 00:19:12,720
Oh, shit.

311
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:25,320
Okay, so you three, four, five people, things, have this interlude, and you head back to the temple.

312
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:32,620
William Johnson, I guess you're using Solvent's Umbrella at this point?

313
00:19:32,620 --> 00:19:34,620
Like, how are you protecting yourself?

314
00:19:34,620 --> 00:19:36,320
I'm just running really fast.

315
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:36,720
Yeah.

316
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:39,720
I'm trying to get into the... I'll take whatever damage is necessary.

317
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:46,420
I'm just trying to get into that hole. Okay, so let me roll for whatever damage that would be so it's probably several minutes

318
00:19:46,420 --> 00:19:55,180
Mmm. I'm very fast actually let's see well. Let's say it's at least I turn on my turbo mode

319
00:19:55,180 --> 00:19:57,940
Let's say it's at least eight minutes, right?

320
00:19:57,940 --> 00:20:02,420
That's 28 damage

321
00:20:02,420 --> 00:20:08,280
Put the umbrella

322
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:13,680
I'll hold the umbrella over him.

323
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:16,680
Okay, all right, I make fun of the temple.

324
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:18,680
Look at your goofy ass.

325
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:20,480
Yes, umbrella.

326
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:21,680
I trip him.

327
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:23,680
So he falls face first.

328
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:25,680
Oh, okay.

329
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:29,280
So yeah, you make it back to the temple.

330
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:32,480
And yeah, it's the same as it was when you left.

331
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:36,800
That was so inconsiderate inconsiderate of you guys to take that huge detour.

332
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:39,000
or we were just about to get into the temple.

333
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,200
I wanted to go in here the whole time.

334
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:42,720
- Yeah, you guys, that made no sense.

335
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:44,040
- Who is that?

336
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:44,880
What is that?

337
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:48,040
(imitates frog croaking)

338
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:49,920
- That's Sullivan the frog.

339
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:52,760
- I thought this one was Sullivan the frog.

340
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:54,360
- No, that's Kevin the frog.

341
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:56,840
- No shit, don't, don't call me Kevin.

342
00:20:56,840 --> 00:20:59,320
- Okay, wait, wait, wait, we'll solve this.

343
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:02,120
I point to the penguin.

344
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:03,880
You're Sullivan the frog one.

345
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:04,920
And I point to Sullivan.

346
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:06,920
You're Sullivan the Frog too.

347
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:09,920
You know what, I'll... shit, I'll take it.

348
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:11,920
We'll just call you Crud for short.

349
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:13,920
Oh shit, fucking hell.

350
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:15,920
Shut up, Crud.

351
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:17,920
Yeah, Crud, what are you doing?

352
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:19,920
Go into the temple, Crud.

353
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:21,920
Yeah, Crud, you go first.

354
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:23,920
Sullivan, you're chill. I like you.

355
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:25,920
He gives you a shaka brah.

356
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:39,220
So yeah, so the temple itself is surrounded by this like massive moat almost, like it's

357
00:21:39,220 --> 00:21:46,900
on like an island and then there's this moat of like really, really, really warm water.

358
00:21:46,900 --> 00:21:53,740
They say that there's a secret star that died 3 billion years ago and its heat death creates

359
00:21:53,740 --> 00:21:57,440
like a single beam of heat on the planet of on planet

360
00:21:57,440 --> 00:22:00,740
Ibom in the soy waste and it's this pocket is where

361
00:22:00,740 --> 00:22:03,540
it's somehow miraculously form.

362
00:22:03,540 --> 00:22:07,540
You see also all the penguins like like over a hundred

363
00:22:07,540 --> 00:22:13,140
of them are holding hands doing a kiki dance around

364
00:22:13,140 --> 00:22:18,540
this big temple and you see a snitchy-boochie says

365
00:22:18,540 --> 00:22:22,740
they do the dance of my people the kiki dance.

366
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:25,440
They respect me greatly.

367
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:29,440
But before we go any further, I must know.

368
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:38,440
Uh, this Pennsylvania Jim and his Crayola, do they know where we are?

369
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:41,440
Probably, I don't know.

370
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:43,440
They probably do.

371
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:45,440
Why don't you ask them?

372
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:47,440
Yeah, they're right over there.

373
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:49,680
(laughing)

374
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:57,200
- No, no, don't do this.

375
00:22:57,200 --> 00:23:01,480
- I was just pointing to a group of penguins.

376
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:05,800
- See one of them just looks at you with the gym face.

377
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:09,300
Like, holy fuck, that looks just like gym.

378
00:23:09,300 --> 00:23:14,920
- Yeah, as you make it through the warm water

379
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:16,440
that surrounds a small sandbar,

380
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:19,140
It's it has like a restorative warmth.

381
00:23:19,140 --> 00:23:22,540
It's like a heated pool at a hotel though.

382
00:23:22,540 --> 00:23:24,040
Not like a natural hot Springs.

383
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:32,840
It feels weird and and as you walk towards the temple one of

384
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:37,240
the VR penguins turns around and squawks at snitchy Bucci's

385
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:43,040
like rock up and up and Suchi Buchi says they are saying that

386
00:23:43,040 --> 00:24:04,260
the

387
00:24:04,260 --> 00:24:09,340
I'm not gonna say it if that's what you know. No, not to say the word. That's just sort of like a

388
00:24:09,340 --> 00:24:16,420
Long like a long joke over the whole thing. It's not nobody should say the word. Yeah

389
00:24:16,420 --> 00:24:20,500
It's kind of ready to go into the temple Caleb don't

390
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:27,280
Yes, yes, yeah, okay

391
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:32,780
The first thing you notice is that there's a 15-foot vagina in front of you though. Mm-hmm

392
00:24:34,140 --> 00:24:38,140
and it is dry.

393
00:24:38,140 --> 00:24:42,140
Oh no. I'll take care of this.

394
00:24:42,140 --> 00:24:46,140
I start rubbing my ass horns on the sides of it.

395
00:24:46,140 --> 00:24:50,140
Yeah, you like that you big stupid golden bitch?

396
00:24:50,140 --> 00:24:54,140

00:25:02,140 --> 00:25:14,820

completely realistic

440
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:00,520
which is that it does have

441
00:27:00,520 --> 00:27:03,800

I get on his- I put my feet on his head.

463
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:53,800
Alright, he's gonna have to roll a strength check to see if he can hold you.

464
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:55,280
Which is not gonna do well.

465
00:27:55,280 --> 00:27:56,320
He's gonna be able to do it.

466
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:58,800
He just collapses immediately.

467
00:27:58,800 --> 00:27:59,300
Like...

468
00:27:59,300 --> 00:28:02,600
I throw him up in the air at it.

469
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:03,720
I throw up.

470
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:05,600
Wait, you throw who?

471
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:06,700
Crud.

472
00:28:06,700 --> 00:28:07,580
Okay.

473
00:28:07,580 --> 00:28:12,120
Yeah, you throw him at the clit and he's just holding onto it.

474
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:17,920
And the, the, the door is just start to go like, they just vibrate a little bit.

475
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:18,740
Oh,

476
00:28:18,740 --> 00:28:20,200
start peeing on it.

477
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:21,240
Go nuts, dude.

478
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:23,200
I don't have to pee.

479
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:24,760

Wait, let's go find some water.

Yeah.

484
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:30,520
There's a, wait, there's a moat out front.

485
00:28:30,520 --> 00:28:30,800
Yeah.

486
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:31,960
We get a, we get some water.

487
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:32,720
That's not clean.

488
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:34,040
We got to go back to town.

489
00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:36,040

I'm gonna throw a pail of water

495
00:28:46,040 --> 00:28:48,040
maybe peeing isn't the way, let's think about this

496
00:28:48,040 --> 00:28:52,040
hmm

497
00:28:52,040 --> 00:28:54,040
bite it

498
00:28:54,040 --> 00:28:56,040
I've got an idea

499
00:28:56,040 --> 00:28:58,040
and he bites it and it shudders again

500
00:28:58,040 --> 00:29:00,040
but it's not like

501
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:02,040
there's something about it

502
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:04,540
didn't quite work to bite the click

503
00:29:04,540 --> 00:29:07,060

504
00:29:07,060 --> 00:29:08,600

uh...

506
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:12,160
and he just starts laughing at

507
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:15,120
and this starts to work a little bit

508
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:16,200
uh...

509
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:19,660
you start to see a bit of juices

510
00:29:19,660 --> 00:29:21,440
trailed down

511
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:22,760
from the door

512
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:24,840
and go directly into

513
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:27,920
the moat insert to realize

514
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:29,800
the moat

515
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:32,180
in the juices

516
00:29:32,180 --> 00:29:33,820
and you start to realize

517
00:29:33,820 --> 00:29:35,980

518
00:29:35,980 --> 00:29:38,300

546
00:30:42,900 --> 00:30:45,260

547
00:30:45,260 --> 00:30:47,340

and uh... you do with stitching beaches in tow

549
00:30:51,260 --> 00:30:53,460
We go to the first part of this temple.

550
00:30:53,460 --> 00:30:56,460
The first part.

551
00:30:56,460 --> 00:31:07,860
It's a massive room and it has like this like below you is like

552
00:31:07,860 --> 00:31:11,960
this sort of a almost like sickly green.

553
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:19,460
Like cobblestones and like this mud and and it's sort of this

554
00:31:19,460 --> 00:31:27,580
like mixture of terrain. But yeah, you can't see too far ahead just yet just because of

555
00:31:27,580 --> 00:31:38,780
how dark it is in here. But yeah, that's what you're seeing right now. So what do you guys

556
00:31:38,780 --> 00:31:58,260
one

557
00:31:58,260 --> 00:32:17,820
to

558
00:32:17,820 --> 00:32:21,340
on purpose because how could you be so foolish?

559
00:32:21,340 --> 00:32:26,100
Well no because I texted the group chat that we were recording tonight and I asked him

560
00:32:26,100 --> 00:32:27,100
what time he ordered it.

561
00:32:27,100 --> 00:32:28,580
We're recording at 7, he knows that.

562
00:32:28,580 --> 00:32:29,580
He ordered at 6.45.

563
00:32:29,580 --> 00:32:33,620
Yeah but sometimes he just does something on impulse and he doesn't know.

564
00:32:33,620 --> 00:32:34,620
That doesn't...

565
00:32:34,620 --> 00:32:36,700
I know, I know it doesn't make sense.

566
00:32:36,700 --> 00:32:37,780
You don't need to...

567
00:32:37,780 --> 00:32:39,900
I'm close enough to kill him now.

568
00:32:39,900 --> 00:32:40,900
Right.

569
00:32:40,900 --> 00:32:41,980
And he should be more aware of that.

570
00:32:41,980 --> 00:32:44,300
I'm gonna pause this so I don't have to edit through all this stuff.

571
00:32:44,300 --> 00:32:45,300
Yeah that's fine.

572
00:32:45,300 --> 00:32:46,300
Yeah, that's fair.

573
00:32:46,300 --> 00:32:47,300
Alright.

574
00:32:47,300 --> 00:33:02,300
the

575
00:33:02,300 --> 00:33:05,980
You saved that in order, 'cause you just threw away all of your food.

576
00:33:05,980 --> 00:33:11,500
Sometimes, sometimes with Pat you're like, "Oh, he's just sort of a scam."

577
00:33:11,500 --> 00:33:13,100
And he does shit like this.

578
00:33:13,100 --> 00:33:13,600
Yeah.

579
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:14,460
You're like, "Huh."

580
00:33:14,460 --> 00:33:17,100
He's actually an evil person. I'm not evil.

581
00:33:17,100 --> 00:33:17,900
He's got, you know what it is?

582
00:33:17,900 --> 00:33:19,340
Spit out the fry.

583
00:33:19,340 --> 00:33:24,340
It's, he has like a, he does have a selective thing going on, and then he remembers

584
00:33:24,340 --> 00:33:28,340
that it would be funny to do something, and so then he does it.

585
00:33:28,340 --> 00:33:31,060
And then it's sort of like after the fact, he's like, "Oh."

586
00:33:31,060 --> 00:33:34,820
that was a part of the other thing they were mad at but it was funny

587
00:33:34,820 --> 00:33:36,740
again

588
00:33:36,740 --> 00:33:37,900
again

589
00:33:37,900 --> 00:33:41,420
and i think i guess that's just what i think i'm just it's a good thing to do

590
00:33:41,420 --> 00:33:43,100
and i think i could like a year and a half

591
00:33:43,100 --> 00:33:45,660

592
00:33:45,660 --> 00:33:49,860

cobblestone with the most of it is dark yet

611
00:34:35,780 --> 00:34:39,320
you know it's a bit starkly nasty you'd have to wait for

612
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:41,360
wander your way through to

613
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:44,200
a crime or what it is

614
00:34:44,200 --> 00:34:48,020
can you get flashlight you can you just can you just like run around the entire

616
00:34:50,300 --> 00:34:54,540

619
00:34:57,820 --> 00:35:02,740
so i'll have uh... solomon or a_k_a_ crud

620
00:35:02,740 --> 00:35:06,980
is using a little crud from now on i think the accurate

621
00:35:06,980 --> 00:35:10,580
crud manages to walk about this far

622
00:35:10,580 --> 00:35:11,660
and uh...

623
00:35:11,660 --> 00:35:14,240
he walks around i should say

624
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:16,800
uh... which reveals a bit more than that

625
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:18,980
to you guys

626
00:35:18,980 --> 00:35:22,980
and it seems like that we're sort of seeing crud do that one more time

627
00:35:22,980 --> 00:35:26,340
a bit of more of a kid since early

628
00:35:26,340 --> 00:35:27,920
atrium

629
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:30,920
couple these wheels here

630
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:36,000
and large staircase and as you can see the walk through

631
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:37,320
c like a big

632
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:39,080
fuckin egg

633
00:35:39,080 --> 00:35:40,440
in the middle of like a

634
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:42,340
stone nest

635
00:35:42,340 --> 00:35:46,820

636
00:35:46,820 --> 00:35:47,860

the

640
00:36:05,540 --> 00:36:20,620
the

641
00:36:20,620 --> 00:36:23,420
book of different kinds of terrain kind of

642
00:36:23,420 --> 00:36:25,300
mashed up in it

643
00:36:25,300 --> 00:36:27,180
uh...

644
00:36:27,180 --> 00:36:28,700
okay

645
00:36:28,700 --> 00:36:32,860
uh... okay we're going to see if you get eighteen fourteen so

646
00:36:32,860 --> 00:36:35,380
uh... as you sort of wander around

647
00:36:35,380 --> 00:36:38,860
uh... patrick you know that and uh... ray william johnson

648
00:36:38,860 --> 00:36:41,460
you also are able to see that there are these two

649
00:36:41,460 --> 00:36:44,020
uh... very pretty windows

650
00:36:44,020 --> 00:36:45,900
that have uh...

651
00:36:45,900 --> 00:36:48,240
outside of them he's like glass

652
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:50,340
uh... boxes

653
00:36:50,340 --> 00:36:51,620
uh...

654
00:36:51,620 --> 00:36:55,280
and they have these numbers on them as you look outside the windows he's class

655
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:57,480
boxes seem to be

656
00:36:57,480 --> 00:36:59,240
uh... suspended

657
00:36:59,240 --> 00:37:03,080
in air and beyond those class boxes you see like

658
00:37:03,080 --> 00:37:04,700
a giant like

659
00:37:04,700 --> 00:37:07,340
room filled with water

660
00:37:07,340 --> 00:37:10,120
and like some sort of

661
00:37:10,120 --> 00:37:12,940
long

662
00:37:12,940 --> 00:37:14,320
iron bridge

663
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:16,560
extending out from

664
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:19,600
a door that's behind the a and leave

665
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:21,520
and that is right over here

666
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:23,000
between these windows

667
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:24,140
and that door is

668
00:37:24,140 --> 00:37:25,520
sealed shut

669
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:27,520
and glowing blue

670
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:28,480
uh... but

671
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:32,280
you see these glass boxes extending from these windows one has a number five on

672
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:36,000
it the other is a number nine on

673
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,340
so there's just two of them

674
00:37:37,340 --> 00:37:43,520
all my god this is where we're still five nine lived

675
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:49,040
uh... the wheels you see so far i turn the wheels to five and nine

676
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:50,000
uh...

677
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:54,700
so the wheels are not they don't have any markings on

678
00:37:54,700 --> 00:37:55,560
uh...

679
00:37:55,560 --> 00:37:58,060
they don't have any number markings on

680
00:37:58,060 --> 00:38:00,260
uh... which we'll do you turn

681
00:38:00,260 --> 00:38:02,240
the five-mile direction

682
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:03,460
and uh... and

683
00:38:03,460 --> 00:38:06,580
as you turn it you feel a notch change

684
00:38:06,580 --> 00:38:09,040
and like a like a sh

685
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:12,040
And as you feel change, which direction do you turn it, by the way?

686
00:38:12,040 --> 00:38:14,480
Clockwise.

687
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:16,000
Okay.

688
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:20,200
As you turn it clockwise, it goes from five to six.

689
00:38:20,200 --> 00:38:25,600
And let's get everybody in the positions that they're in.

690
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:27,280
So I know you're here.

691
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:30,000
Blow tosses here.

692
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,440
That's never a good sign.

693
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:32,960
Crud is here.

694
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:35,760
Where's Sullivan?

695
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:37,320

699
00:38:45,820 --> 00:38:47,920
He lifts his head up.

700
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:49,520
You see like a dead rat in his mouth.

701
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:50,720
He gives a thumbs up.

702
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:54,120

I love you.

704
00:38:54,820 --> 00:38:55,920
Got style.

705
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:56,920
Oh, yeah.

706
00:38:56,920 --> 00:39:02,020
I love Sullivan.

707
00:39:02,020 --> 00:39:04,120
Oh my God.

708
00:39:04,120 --> 00:39:06,220
This new Sullivan is so sick.

709
00:39:06,520 --> 00:39:08,520
so much cooler than the whole thing.

710
00:39:08,520 --> 00:39:10,520
He's like a minion dude, he's the best.

711
00:39:10,520 --> 00:39:12,520
Wait, wait, wait, can we ask New Sullivan his real name?

712
00:39:12,520 --> 00:39:14,520
Like a Grogu situation, can we?

713
00:39:14,520 --> 00:39:16,520
Can we do one of those?

714
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:18,520
No, we have to wait a few episodes for that.

715
00:39:18,520 --> 00:39:20,520
Yeah, we gotta reveal it.

716
00:39:20,520 --> 00:39:22,520
I have to make a character sheet for him.

717
00:39:22,520 --> 00:39:24,520
[laughter]

718
00:39:24,520 --> 00:39:26,520
Cause this guy exists now.

719
00:39:26,520 --> 00:39:28,520
I warned you multiple times I was going to be making a guy.

720
00:39:28,520 --> 00:39:30,520
Oh, you did, you did.

721
00:39:30,520 --> 00:39:32,520
Yeah, this is on you.

722
00:39:32,520 --> 00:39:34,520
He says a lot about you as a DM.

723
00:39:34,520 --> 00:39:38,020
Honestly, I didn't believe you and that was my bad.

724
00:39:38,020 --> 00:39:40,520
I should have known you would try to make a guy.

725
00:39:40,520 --> 00:39:45,520
The last time we'll probably play this, you're gonna try to make a guy.

726
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:51,020
So, roll a dexterity saving throw...

727
00:39:51,020 --> 00:39:55,520
- Blowtoss. - Easy.

728
00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:58,520
- 13. - Okay.

729
00:39:58,520 --> 00:40:03,020
So, some of the ground beneath you, some of that weird mixed terrain,

730
00:40:03,020 --> 00:40:09,020
This like snowy muddy rocks like kind of forms together into a wave and

731
00:40:09,020 --> 00:40:11,860
knocks into you

732
00:40:11,860 --> 00:40:17,500
You almost get out of the way you almost sort of spidey sense it but not quite and it does

733
00:40:17,500 --> 00:40:24,640
Seven damage knocks into you seven as you knocks you to the ground

734
00:40:27,700 --> 00:40:35,100
And you see a stoogey-boogey sort of runs over to you and he says there's something going on here these numbers

735
00:40:35,100 --> 00:40:40,180
These things the ground it is responding to your actions. Obviously, I

736
00:40:40,180 --> 00:40:43,820
Fear that this is the n-word pass I

737
00:40:43,820 --> 00:40:47,840
Should tell you what it does now that we're here

738
00:40:47,840 --> 00:40:52,440
The n-word pass can remake reality

739
00:40:52,440 --> 00:40:54,660
in

740
00:40:54,660 --> 00:41:04,740
and it it's imaginative he make wishes almost with it so many celebrities white

741
00:41:04,740 --> 00:41:11,140
celebrities use the n-word past in the one way that it would suggest it should

742
00:41:11,140 --> 00:41:15,540
be used which is to let them say the n-word and preserve their career for

743
00:41:15,540 --> 00:41:22,820
example Gwyneth Paltrow she used the n-word pass she's fine

744
00:41:22,820 --> 00:41:28,460
Kramer didn't have the n-word pass you see what I'm saying you can you give us

745
00:41:28,460 --> 00:41:32,260
any examples of celebrities that like we would know instead of ones from like 200

746
00:41:32,260 --> 00:41:36,380
years ago and he gives like a recent example yeah yeah you know like space

747
00:41:36,380 --> 00:41:46,220
Kramer sure space Kramer use the oh my god now I get Jesus Christ I remember I

748
00:41:46,220 --> 00:41:51,180
remember space Kramer at the lol factory oh yeah I remember when that first

749
00:41:51,180 --> 00:41:55,140
uh... dropped on space d_n_c_ i lost my mind

750
00:41:55,140 --> 00:41:57,820
the are ever him on space and pat a man

751
00:41:57,820 --> 00:42:02,940
yeah i don't know what i think i don't know what i would do not was crazy but

752
00:42:02,940 --> 00:42:06,120
space mckee stanfield who's white

753
00:42:06,120 --> 00:42:13,120
didn't use the end of the past

754
00:42:13,120 --> 00:42:19,660
and look what happened to him

755
00:42:19,660 --> 00:42:30,300
career over. I remember that. We all do. So anyway, but this is not the only thing the

756
00:42:30,300 --> 00:42:37,380
N-word pass can do. This is just the way that people have used it. If you use it beyond that

757
00:42:37,380 --> 00:42:44,920
though it has dangerous side effects. But if it's just to do something like, you know,

758
00:42:44,920 --> 00:42:49,400
people forgive you for doing something very stupid, you know, that's reality you could

759
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:53,400
remake with little cost to yourself.

760
00:42:53,400 --> 00:42:57,080
So what I am thinking is that the N-word pass is remaking this room.

761
00:42:57,080 --> 00:42:59,400
It is doing something to it.

762
00:42:59,400 --> 00:43:02,260
It is making it react.

763
00:43:02,260 --> 00:43:04,280
Maybe it knows that we're here.

764
00:43:04,280 --> 00:43:06,600
So wait, we have it right now?

765
00:43:06,600 --> 00:43:08,000
No, we don't.

766
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:09,000
We don't have it.

767
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:10,000
So we can leave.

768
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:11,000
I mean...

769
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:13,440
And go back to town.

770
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:18,320
If that's really what you want to do, this is Dungeons and Dragons.

771
00:43:18,320 --> 00:43:20,320
You can do whatever you want.

772
00:43:20,320 --> 00:43:21,320
What?

773
00:43:21,320 --> 00:43:22,320
Hold on.

774
00:43:22,320 --> 00:43:23,320
Let me talk to the narrator real quick.

775
00:43:23,320 --> 00:43:26,320
You mean Space Dungeons and Dragons?

776
00:43:26,320 --> 00:43:27,320
Yes.

777
00:43:27,320 --> 00:43:28,320
Oh, okay.

778
00:43:28,320 --> 00:43:29,320
Oh, okay.

779
00:43:29,320 --> 00:43:30,320
All right.

780
00:43:30,320 --> 00:43:31,320
By Space Gary Gygus.

781
00:43:31,320 --> 00:43:32,320
Yes, I knew that.

782
00:43:32,320 --> 00:43:35,440
Who is Chinese, as we all know.

783
00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:36,920
Mm-hmm.

784
00:43:36,920 --> 00:43:39,600
Okay, but yeah.

785
00:43:39,600 --> 00:43:42,440
So I'm just saying we must be cautious.

786
00:43:42,440 --> 00:43:48,120
So you're saying somebody wished for these wheels to change the numbers on the glass

787
00:43:48,120 --> 00:43:49,120
boxes?

788
00:43:49,120 --> 00:43:55,880
I'm wondering if somebody made this whole puzzle from the work pass.

789
00:43:55,880 --> 00:43:59,800
Oh, so Pennsylvania Jim was here.

790
00:43:59,800 --> 00:44:02,440
Perhaps.

791
00:44:02,440 --> 00:44:03,640
He said perhaps.

792
00:44:03,640 --> 00:44:04,640
That means it's true.

793
00:44:04,640 --> 00:44:09,320
It's though at the same time, it does resemble the Tamagotchis.

794
00:44:09,320 --> 00:44:12,360
Maybe the Tamagotchis made this before they vanished.

795
00:44:12,360 --> 00:44:14,360
Maybe it's a trick.

796
00:44:14,360 --> 00:44:15,360
Maybe.

797
00:44:15,360 --> 00:44:17,160
I do not know.

798
00:44:17,160 --> 00:44:21,480
But we must discover this puzzle.

799
00:44:21,480 --> 00:44:24,640
I think we should talk about tricks.

800
00:44:24,640 --> 00:44:27,120
I know that's right.

801
00:44:27,120 --> 00:44:31,960
What are some two digit numbers that we could make with this?

802
00:44:31,960 --> 00:44:33,960
23, Michael Jordan.

803
00:44:33,960 --> 00:44:37,240
Well, it's on 6-9 right now.

804
00:44:37,240 --> 00:44:38,240
That's true.

805
00:44:38,240 --> 00:44:39,240
69.

806
00:44:39,240 --> 00:44:56,240
So I will say though, just because you're in this giant room, some other things you'd be able to see is that there is also some sort of pathway this way that looks like it goes completely black as you go further into it.

807
00:44:56,240 --> 00:45:01,240
And then there is a bit more of a pathway this way as well.

808
00:45:01,240 --> 00:45:07,240
Okay, we should split up. I will go check out the right side path. Somebody go check out the other one.

809
00:45:07,240 --> 00:45:13,960
the other one. I'll check out the left one. Okay. I'll go with Ray William Johnson. Oh,

810
00:45:13,960 --> 00:45:19,800
I have to work with Crud. No, you get Sullivan too. You can balance each other out pretty

811
00:45:19,800 --> 00:45:25,040
much. Yeah. Honestly, Sullivan kind of more than makes up for Crud. He's like two times

812
00:45:25,040 --> 00:45:32,120
as cool. Easily. Easily. Okay. That's all right. Got it. Loud and clear. Who are you

813
00:45:32,120 --> 00:45:37,720
talking to? Sorry, Craig, did you say something? Oh my god. Did anybody hear a fly say something?

814
00:45:37,720 --> 00:45:44,920
Buzz, buzz! That's right, that's right, Sullivan. That's f*cking right. Oh yeah!

815
00:45:44,920 --> 00:45:48,920
Oh, I thought we were talking about that fly we met on the way here. Sullivan,

816
00:45:48,920 --> 00:45:50,440
I just love your catchphrase.

817
00:45:54,920 --> 00:46:01,420
Yeah, and he sort of wanders over to join you Patrick Yoda and and you

818
00:46:01,420 --> 00:46:05,580
So Cameron's just me me crud

819
00:46:05,580 --> 00:46:09,160
Enjoy me crud

820
00:46:09,160 --> 00:46:15,640
Having zero debilitating effects on my brain, I'm fine

821
00:46:15,640 --> 00:46:18,560
It's easy. Are you crying?

822
00:46:18,560 --> 00:46:22,080
Me crud

823
00:46:23,960 --> 00:46:30,960
Meanwhile, you two and Snoochie Boochies goes over in this direction.

824
00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:35,960
So you guys see it's like a long... so let's do a... oh goodness.

825
00:46:35,960 --> 00:46:38,960
Let's do the Sullivan-Patrick path first.

826
00:46:38,960 --> 00:46:49,960
So yeah, you guys walk into this big room and you start to see that some of the snow effects of the N-word pass grow in size.

827
00:46:49,960 --> 00:46:53,980
So it's a, the room's like colder almost.

828
00:46:53,980 --> 00:46:57,500
And you see actually another one of those windows and you would know, you don't even have to

829
00:46:57,500 --> 00:47:04,380
roll investigation, you would know that that the window has a number behind it.

830
00:47:04,380 --> 00:47:06,340
This time it's the number three.

831
00:47:06,340 --> 00:47:08,620
Um, okay.

832
00:47:08,620 --> 00:47:11,940
Is there, is there like a switch in this room?

833
00:47:11,940 --> 00:47:12,940
So that's a good question.

834
00:47:12,940 --> 00:47:15,300
There's a few things in this, in this larger sort of room.

835
00:47:15,300 --> 00:47:26,300
So you see the same musty green cobblestone and you see also a couple corpses of dead

836
00:47:26,300 --> 00:47:28,300
adventurers from the past.

837
00:47:28,300 --> 00:47:31,780
You also see a computer and a couple of servers.

838
00:47:31,780 --> 00:47:35,620
The computer and the servers are off.

839
00:47:35,620 --> 00:47:38,180
They don't seem to be functioning.

840
00:47:38,180 --> 00:47:42,300
And then you also see a pedestal in the middle of the room.

841
00:47:42,300 --> 00:47:43,300
A pedophile?

842
00:47:43,300 --> 00:47:44,300
Nope.

843
00:47:44,300 --> 00:47:49,660
There is one in that room right now. Yeah, it's crud. Mm-hmm. No, I'm not I can hear you

844
00:47:49,660 --> 00:47:57,260
What I can hear I could stop stop drawing that don't I'm moving around

845
00:47:57,260 --> 00:48:02,020
You can't him. This is really good audio

846
00:48:02,020 --> 00:48:08,860
Moving around from the drawing of the word pedo. You're putting over my characters head

847
00:48:08,860 --> 00:48:13,180
And you see there is a the in the pedestal

848
00:48:13,180 --> 00:48:23,180
Yeah, the pedestal has sort of like a, it's pretty funny. Sorry. Okay. Sorry for everyone at home.

849
00:48:23,180 --> 00:48:39,180
You see that the pedestal has sort of like a convex sort of a, or concave sort of a part of it where something could maybe go inside of it and then you see this computer and these servers you see this window that says three on it.

850
00:48:39,180 --> 00:48:43,620
And so that's what's in this room, from what you can tell.

851
00:48:43,620 --> 00:48:46,220
So I'm gonna open the computer.

852
00:48:46,220 --> 00:48:47,220
Okay.

853
00:48:47,220 --> 00:48:58,540
Uh, you open the computer and it shows a, like a grayscale pixelated version of a grave

854
00:48:58,540 --> 00:49:03,500
with a ghost flying around it that looks like you.

855
00:49:03,500 --> 00:49:05,740
(laughing)

856
00:49:05,740 --> 00:49:10,700
- Hey, Sol, hey, Crud, come here, is this bad?

857
00:49:10,700 --> 00:49:14,880
- As you see Crud walk over and look at the grave picture,

858
00:49:14,880 --> 00:49:18,780
you see a ghost that looks like him.

859
00:49:18,780 --> 00:49:23,060
And he's like, "Uh, this is weird, if anything."

860
00:49:23,060 --> 00:49:26,580
- I shouldn't touch this then, huh?

861
00:49:26,580 --> 00:49:29,220
- I don't know if we shouldn't or should touch it.

862
00:49:29,220 --> 00:49:31,140
I'd like, hmm, I mean--

863
00:49:31,140 --> 00:49:34,140
I'll check it out.

864
00:49:34,140 --> 00:49:37,140
Oh shit.

865
00:49:37,140 --> 00:49:39,140
Okay, wow, okay.

866
00:49:39,140 --> 00:49:44,140
So, you're examining the computer and you're seeing sort of its, what is it, what does it do?

867
00:49:44,140 --> 00:49:47,140
It's sort of confusing you.

868
00:49:47,140 --> 00:49:51,140
What you start to notice, I mean with a crit on that investigation.

869
00:49:51,140 --> 00:49:52,140
Yep, that's right.

870
00:49:52,140 --> 00:49:59,140
You start to turn away from the computer and you see out of the corner of your eye,

871
00:49:59,140 --> 00:50:11,140
are

872
00:50:11,140 --> 00:50:13,640
you see him moving his head around and you watch his ghost

873
00:50:13,640 --> 00:50:18,840
get smaller and you watch it get bigger even as as the real

874
00:50:18,840 --> 00:50:23,840
Sullivan is like just like slapping the ground and acting

875
00:50:23,840 --> 00:50:28,940
like a fucked up penguin is he looks at the you swatch his

876
00:50:28,940 --> 00:50:32,040
ghost appear and disappear rapidly as his head randomly

877
00:50:32,040 --> 00:50:35,940
turns towards the computer and also with that crit.

878
00:50:35,940 --> 00:50:39,640
I will say that like you notice that when your head turns

879
00:50:39,640 --> 00:50:46,600
away from the computer like when all your heads are away from it you hear the

880
00:50:46,600 --> 00:50:49,600
turning of a gear

881
00:50:49,600 --> 00:50:58,960
ok I should investigate more because I have no idea what what that could do

882
00:50:58,960 --> 00:51:05,040
well why don't we we try

883
00:51:05,600 --> 00:51:10,160
Okay, why don't we try all turning away from the computer?

884
00:51:10,160 --> 00:51:12,360
We already are!

885
00:51:12,360 --> 00:51:15,420
So when you turn back...

886
00:51:15,420 --> 00:51:17,940
You fucking moron, we already are!

887
00:51:17,940 --> 00:51:20,960
You see the number go down to two.

888
00:51:20,960 --> 00:51:26,480
The minute stops.

889
00:51:26,480 --> 00:51:28,480
It's like a Mario ghost.

890
00:51:28,480 --> 00:51:33,080
Get it to say one!

891
00:51:33,080 --> 00:51:35,080
I'm gonna go type one on the computer.

892
00:51:35,080 --> 00:51:36,080
[laughter]

893
00:51:36,080 --> 00:51:38,080
It doesn't do anything on the computer.

894
00:51:38,080 --> 00:51:43,080
Okay, so I move, um, Sullivan and Crud away from...

895
00:51:43,080 --> 00:51:47,080
the computer, like we all turn around.

896
00:51:47,080 --> 00:51:50,080
Yeah. You hear it go-- you hear that crank go again.

897
00:51:50,080 --> 00:51:52,080
Do you turn around?

898
00:51:52,080 --> 00:51:54,080
No.

899
00:51:54,080 --> 00:51:57,080
Okay. You hear that crank go again.

900
00:51:57,080 --> 00:52:00,080
And when you hear that crank go that one more time,

901
00:52:01,080 --> 00:52:03,000
you see uh...

902
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:04,800
the pedestal

903
00:52:04,800 --> 00:52:05,920
shoot up

904
00:52:05,920 --> 00:52:07,680
something in the in the middle of it

905
00:52:07,680 --> 00:52:11,260
like a little hole it shoots up and it goes back down

906
00:52:11,260 --> 00:52:13,520
and then you hear that crank again

907
00:52:13,520 --> 00:52:15,480
is someone looking at it

908
00:52:15,480 --> 00:52:17,820
is what are you fuckers looking at it right now

909
00:52:17,820 --> 00:52:19,600
no

910
00:52:19,600 --> 00:52:21,160
if you look at it

911
00:52:21,160 --> 00:52:23,840
do you look at it

912
00:52:23,840 --> 00:52:26,140
you gotta look at it sometime

913
00:52:26,140 --> 00:52:29,360
what are you trying to get it to do

914
00:52:29,360 --> 00:52:30,560
He's playing mind games with it.

915
00:52:30,560 --> 00:52:32,160
Does the pedestal pop up again?

916
00:52:32,160 --> 00:52:33,860
No.

917
00:52:33,860 --> 00:52:35,160
If you stand there though-

918
00:52:35,160 --> 00:52:35,960
Yeah, no, not yet.

919
00:52:35,960 --> 00:52:39,860
Okay, then I'm gonna look at it.

920
00:52:39,860 --> 00:52:41,760
It's now at nine.

921
00:52:41,760 --> 00:52:43,060
What?!

922
00:52:43,060 --> 00:52:44,360
It looped around, dude.

923
00:52:44,360 --> 00:52:46,360
It went down to one and then you let it go again.

924
00:52:46,360 --> 00:52:49,060
Fuck.

925
00:52:49,060 --> 00:52:51,560
Is that bad or good?

926
00:52:51,560 --> 00:52:52,160
I don't know.

927
00:52:52,160 --> 00:52:53,160
I don't know either.

928
00:52:53,160 --> 00:52:57,360
Are they all supposed to say nine?

929
00:52:57,360 --> 00:53:00,960
You picked the wrong group of three people to do a puzzle like this.

930
00:53:00,960 --> 00:53:02,960
Oh yeah!

931
00:53:02,960 --> 00:53:04,960
[Laughter]

932
00:53:04,960 --> 00:53:06,960
Two patches and one match.

933
00:53:06,960 --> 00:53:10,960
I meant the three of us, but that's true too.

934
00:53:10,960 --> 00:53:14,960
I mean, unless you know the solution, Caleb.

935
00:53:14,960 --> 00:53:16,960
I've already figured it out.

936
00:53:16,960 --> 00:53:18,960
Really?

937
00:53:18,960 --> 00:53:20,960
Yeah, I have.

938
00:53:20,960 --> 00:53:22,960
Hey, Ray, can you come here for a second?

939
00:53:22,960 --> 00:53:24,960
No, I gotta figure out... I haven't even walked down my path, dude.

940
00:53:24,960 --> 00:53:26,040
- Yeah, dude.

941
00:53:26,040 --> 00:53:27,760
- No, we already finished the puzzle in here,

942
00:53:27,760 --> 00:53:29,080
so we'll be there in just a second.

943
00:53:29,080 --> 00:53:30,680
We were doing it off screen.

944
00:53:30,680 --> 00:53:32,880
- Okay, then I'm gonna leave this room

945
00:53:32,880 --> 00:53:34,720
and then wait for you guys.

946
00:53:34,720 --> 00:53:35,560
- Sounds good, buddy.

947
00:53:35,560 --> 00:53:36,680
Just give us a minute.

948
00:53:36,680 --> 00:53:37,520
- Okay.

949
00:53:37,520 --> 00:53:38,340
- Okay.

950
00:53:38,340 --> 00:53:39,180
- There's a lot of numbers involved.

951
00:53:39,180 --> 00:53:40,520
I'm getting very flustered.

952
00:53:40,520 --> 00:53:43,920
- Okay, so you guys, you guys look down the pathway

953
00:53:43,920 --> 00:53:45,320
to where you're going.

954
00:53:45,320 --> 00:53:49,660
You can't see where it leads.

955
00:53:49,660 --> 00:53:54,640
So you start walking down it

956
00:53:54,640 --> 00:53:58,080
And you guys roll a dexterity saving throw.

957
00:53:58,080 --> 00:54:00,480
YOLO, that's the motto.

958
00:54:00,480 --> 00:54:02,100
18.

959
00:54:02,100 --> 00:54:07,520
Patches is trying to kill me before I can one-shot his puzzle.

960
00:54:07,520 --> 00:54:10,020
Big time.

961
00:54:10,020 --> 00:54:11,040
Dexterity.

962
00:54:11,040 --> 00:54:13,360
16.

963
00:54:13,360 --> 00:54:13,860
Okay.

964
00:54:13,860 --> 00:54:18,480
You both start sliding down a like mud slide

965
00:54:18,480 --> 00:54:23,840
and you manage to stop yourselves in the middle after you fall about like 40 feet down.

966
00:54:23,840 --> 00:54:36,720
on

967
00:54:36,720 --> 00:54:38,720
you

968
00:54:38,720 --> 00:54:42,600
uh... put pull up a will uh... your flashlight at

969
00:54:42,600 --> 00:54:45,500

00:54:47,640 --> 00:54:50,740
with its own i don't know what you're doing your brightness up i'll go to the

972
00:54:50,740 --> 00:54:52,720
website for those on the

973
00:54:52,720 --> 00:54:55,320
may you go to the sun sunday com

974
00:54:55,320 --> 00:54:57,020

975
00:54:57,020 --> 00:54:58,020
uh... yeah

976
00:54:58,020 --> 00:55:04,400
you see down you see that the it's like this moist like muddy

977
00:55:04,400 --> 00:55:05,320
slick

978
00:55:05,320 --> 00:55:06,560
to your end

979
00:55:06,560 --> 00:55:08,140
and

980
00:55:08,140 --> 00:55:14,700
You also start to see like little bugs like flying around like swamp bugs flying around

981
00:55:14,700 --> 00:55:17,100
This better not be the butthole. I

982
00:55:17,100 --> 00:55:22,100
Don't think it's easy butthole then lick it

983
00:55:22,100 --> 00:55:26,500
Really prove prove yourself

984
00:55:26,500 --> 00:55:29,860
Just cuz it's not a butthole doesn't mean I should lick it

985
00:55:29,860 --> 00:55:34,300
Lots of things aren't buttholes and I'm not going to lick them like what?

986
00:55:34,300 --> 00:55:36,700
dirt

987
00:55:36,700 --> 00:55:38,220
Why not?

988
00:55:38,220 --> 00:55:42,460
Yes, no one tastes good. I'm not saying it's gonna fucking taste good

989
00:55:42,460 --> 00:55:49,640
Yeah, okay, but you just you just want me to prove it's not poop. Just put your tongue on it. You got to do it

990
00:55:49,640 --> 00:55:56,260
Okay, I like put the whole tube like behind my face sideways

991
00:55:56,260 --> 00:55:58,780
Some okay. Yeah

992
00:55:58,780 --> 00:56:01,460
It tastes like mud

993
00:56:02,100 --> 00:56:08,000
It's a fucking butthole what the fuck you lied to me I did I did no such thing. All right

994
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:12,840
And I'm gonna investigate the bugs, okay

995
00:56:12,840 --> 00:56:15,780
Yeah, roll investigation

996
00:56:15,780 --> 00:56:17,100
21

997
00:56:17,100 --> 00:56:19,840
They just look like real bugs

998
00:56:19,840 --> 00:56:25,440
Wasted that one. Okay. Can I can slide down the rest of the tube?

999
00:56:25,440 --> 00:56:31,440
Yeah, you could try to slide down it. I'm gonna go for it. Yeah, you could just sort of jump and slide down

1000
00:56:31,440 --> 00:56:32,440
I do that.

1001
00:56:32,440 --> 00:56:33,440
Yeah, you slide down.

1002
00:56:33,440 --> 00:56:40,440
You must slide down like another, like, like, it must be like a mile, it feels like.

1003
00:56:40,440 --> 00:56:41,440
Okay.

1004
00:56:41,440 --> 00:56:43,440
You guys can't hear him anymore.

1005
00:56:43,440 --> 00:56:52,440
And you land, plop, in like a big fucking swampy mud pile.

1006
00:56:52,440 --> 00:56:58,440
Way down, must be way below the cave.

1007
00:56:58,440 --> 00:57:02,440
And you see actually another one of those windows.

1008
00:57:02,440 --> 00:57:06,440
And you see another one of those glass boxes.

1009
00:57:06,440 --> 00:57:10,440
And you see this sort of like muddy

1010
00:57:10,440 --> 00:57:14,440
swamp room in front of you. You don't know how far down you are.

1011
00:57:14,440 --> 00:57:18,440
Can I ask you one question? Yeah. Is this the last

1012
00:57:18,440 --> 00:57:22,440
number? Yes. Like there's only four numbers?

1013
00:57:22,440 --> 00:57:26,440
Okay so we need it to spell "leet"? Yes.

1014
00:57:26,440 --> 00:57:28,440
It's gotta be

1015
00:57:28,440 --> 00:57:31,360
He's not gonna he's ice-cold

1016
00:57:31,360 --> 00:57:38,640
Which the fact that he's not currently crying and getting so mad at you means that it's not Lee. No it is

1017
00:57:38,640 --> 00:57:45,760
No, it's Lee. It's Lee. It's either leader boob. It's not even boob. It's

1018
00:57:45,760 --> 00:57:50,220
Fuck. Okay. One second. Let me I got a Google something funny

1019
00:57:50,220 --> 00:57:53,880
Funny for numbers. It's not funny

1020
00:57:54,720 --> 00:57:56,720
Okay, serious four numbers

1021
00:57:56,720 --> 00:58:01,520
What are some of the most intriguing four-digit numbers

1022
00:58:01,520 --> 00:58:12,260
Let's think about okay, so it could be five one seven five is it that this is this is just becoming a hot about list episode

00:58:12,260 --> 00:58:21,380
Mysterious number seven six seven one four that's the name of the number. Okay. I'm gonna roll an investigation check

1024
00:58:21,960 --> 00:58:27,200
Hmm, it looks like my little hole that that whole room is there stuff to the back of that room

1025
00:58:27,200 --> 00:58:30,040
That's a good question

1026

Let me walk on over there

1027
00:58:32,080 --> 00:58:36,920
As you begin to walk over there you start to see

1028
00:58:36,920 --> 00:58:41,880
Heads rise from the mud. Oh

1029
00:58:41,880 --> 00:58:45,120
Oh, yeah

1030
00:58:45,120 --> 00:58:49,840
And

1034
00:59:02,960 --> 00:59:05,160
Oh my god, he was thinking

1035
00:59:05,160 --> 00:59:09,900
The Joker isn't really not friendly. He was if you were also a clown

1036
00:59:09,900 --> 00:59:15,560
That's a man. You were the also the Joker. He's like the friendliest guy of all you see these heads

00:59:15,560 --> 00:59:19,400
Wow, why is up with this fucking tool?

Roll for initiative.

1046
00:59:54,720 --> 00:59:56,720
Can I speak?

1047
00:59:56,720 --> 00:59:58,720
Well you don't know that this is happening because you can't hear me.

1048
00:59:58,720 --> 01:00:00,720
You can certainly try to scream.

1049
01:00:00,720 --> 01:00:02,720
I'm not a girl.

1050
01:00:02,720 --> 01:00:04,720
You aren't.

1051
01:00:04,720 --> 01:00:06,720
He involuntarily screams and I slide down.

1052
01:00:06,720 --> 01:00:08,720
No I do not.

1053
01:00:08,720 --> 01:00:10,720
I will roll for initiative.

1054
01:00:10,720 --> 01:00:12,720
Roll a save.

1055
01:00:12,720 --> 01:00:14,720
I got a zero.

1056
01:00:14,720 --> 01:00:16,720
(Laughter)

1057
01:00:16,720 --> 01:00:18,720
Caleb has to roll a wisdom save

1058
01:00:18,720 --> 01:00:20,720
or else he involuntarily screams.

1059
01:00:20,720 --> 01:00:34,600
is

1060
01:00:34,600 --> 01:00:37,400
you're definitely not going to go first. So why?

1061
01:00:37,400 --> 01:00:40,840
You're going to die. Say something, do something.

1062
01:00:40,840 --> 01:00:46,040
Uh, Hey, is it, can anyone hear me?

1063
01:00:46,040 --> 01:00:47,720
No.

1064
01:00:47,720 --> 01:00:58,520
You try to climb up the mud slide and you're having a hard time.

1065
01:00:58,520 --> 01:01:01,000
Yeah, no, I'll go down and help. Help.

1066
01:01:02,360 --> 01:01:06,520
Wait, I have an idea. Don't come down here yet.

1067
01:01:06,520 --> 01:01:09,520
Okay, I stopped halfway.

1068
01:01:09,520 --> 01:01:11,520
We'll have to be down here at some point.

1069
01:01:11,520 --> 01:01:15,520
So he can hear me when I call out for him?

1070
01:01:15,520 --> 01:01:18,520
He heard you when you said, "Can anybody help me?"

1071
01:01:18,520 --> 01:01:20,520
I said, "Can anyone hear me?"

1072
01:01:20,520 --> 01:01:21,520
You know what I mean.

1073
01:01:21,520 --> 01:01:23,520
I felt the free meaning of your words.

1074
01:01:23,520 --> 01:01:24,520
I decided if I need help here.

1075
01:01:24,520 --> 01:01:25,520
Okay, I'm sorry.

1076
01:01:25,520 --> 01:01:27,520
I heard the fear in your voice.

1077
01:01:27,520 --> 01:01:29,520
The friend link has given us...

1078
01:01:29,520 --> 01:01:31,520
Alright, I will allow him to come down and help me now.

1079
01:01:31,520 --> 01:01:43,880
the

1080
01:01:43,880 --> 01:01:45,800
I don't have a friend link with you.

1081
01:01:45,800 --> 01:01:47,520
I am just Christopher Lambert.

1082
01:01:47,520 --> 01:01:49,280
- Maybe, how did you know?

1083
01:01:49,280 --> 01:01:51,200
How did you know we were thinking about a friend link?

1084
01:01:51,200 --> 01:01:52,440
Maybe you do have one.

1085
01:01:52,440 --> 01:01:54,520
- Oh my, maybe it's the most powerful friend link

1086
01:01:54,520 --> 01:01:55,960
of all time.

1087
01:01:55,960 --> 01:01:57,520
- Hear from the distance.

1088
01:01:57,520 --> 01:01:58,360
Oh yeah.

1092
01:02:03,560 --> 01:02:04,600
- Yeah, come on.

1093
01:02:04,600 --> 01:02:06,040
- Wait, no.

1094
01:02:06,040 --> 01:02:08,640
- He sprints out of the other room

1095
01:02:08,640 --> 01:02:11,520

1123
01:03:41,440 --> 01:03:43,200
i'd run up to it

1124
01:03:43,200 --> 01:03:46,520

1129
01:03:54,480 --> 01:03:56,800
uh...

1130
01:03:56,800 --> 01:03:59,160
so sixteen

1131
01:03:59,160 --> 01:04:00,720
yet it's rover damage

1132
01:04:00,720 --> 01:04:01,840
and that's it

1133
01:04:01,840 --> 01:04:04,360
critical hit

1134
01:04:04,360 --> 01:04:06,000
sometimes to

1135
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:07,880
nice well i don't know

1136
01:04:07,880 --> 01:04:08,780
yeah

1137
01:04:08,780 --> 01:04:11,920

1141
01:04:20,500 --> 01:04:21,740
ray william johnson

01:04:23,840 --> 01:04:25,080
ho ho

1144
01:04:25,080 --> 01:04:28,960
that thing still takes twenty-two but really doesn't you take eleven damage

1145
01:04:28,960 --> 01:04:32,320
oh shit also these are analogous

1146
01:04:32,320 --> 01:04:34,660
is our doppelgangers

1147
01:04:34,660 --> 01:04:35,940
are in the audience

1148
01:04:35,940 --> 01:04:36,980
for her

1149
01:04:36,980 --> 01:04:39,980
the but this letter was a it dot

1150
01:04:39,980 --> 01:04:42,740
that that what i had a you know that

1151
01:04:42,740 --> 01:04:47,260
these are now that we have to do that is the name of the that is their creature

1152
01:04:47,260 --> 01:04:48,260
name

1153
01:04:48,260 --> 01:04:50,460
yep they are the italic eyes

1154
01:04:50,460 --> 01:04:52,740
in

1155
01:04:52,740 --> 01:04:55,340
okay what i meant i take eleven

1156
01:04:55,340 --> 01:04:58,300
yet you feel like the girl who is a little edge

1157
01:04:58,300 --> 01:04:59,500
you

1158
01:04:59,500 --> 01:05:01,380
uh...

1159
01:05:01,380 --> 01:05:03,600
uh... be you apart

1160
01:05:03,600 --> 01:05:04,600
okay

1161
01:05:04,600 --> 01:05:07,200
yet you have another attack to

1162
01:05:07,200 --> 01:05:08,120
locals

1163
01:05:08,120 --> 01:05:11,680
don't get that one

1164
01:05:11,680 --> 01:05:13,360
it they did they know that

1165
01:05:13,360 --> 01:05:15,240
and don't do that

1166
01:05:15,240 --> 01:05:17,600
come on

1167
01:05:17,600 --> 01:05:22,000
when it looks like it's not maybe maybe the analogous will

1168
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:23,760
i've run

1169
01:05:23,760 --> 01:05:26,320
i can't move again so i guess i'll shoot

1170
01:05:26,320 --> 01:05:30,760
you could move again you'll just opportunity

1171
01:05:30,760 --> 01:05:34,440
Okay, well I'll just shoot my analogous

1172
01:05:34,440 --> 01:05:39,040
It is nice to have something to call

1173
01:05:39,040 --> 01:05:43,320
Skeletons, yeah, that'll be so boring

1174
01:05:43,320 --> 01:05:47,600
14 it does sound like a creature so 14 does not hit

1175
01:05:47,600 --> 01:05:50,560
So you just shoot it and this zombie who?

1176
01:05:50,560 --> 01:05:54,560
Deflects it with its own like

1177
01:05:54,680 --> 01:06:02,000
Bone pipe 14 doesn't hit and it glares at you like it okay stares you down after that and that is my bonus action

1178
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:06,300
I'm gonna teleport back just so I'm out of melee range. Okay, cool. Nice

1179
01:06:06,300 --> 01:06:08,480
All right

1180
01:06:08,480 --> 01:06:10,480
Patrick Yoda, it's your turn

1181
01:06:10,480 --> 01:06:13,040
I'm gonna try and talk

1182
01:06:13,040 --> 01:06:18,800
Okay, I'm gonna try and talk to it which line to me, okay

1183
01:06:18,800 --> 01:06:22,240
What do you what do you say?

1184
01:06:22,920 --> 01:06:24,920
Hello

1185
01:06:24,920 --> 01:06:31,100
That sounded exactly like the Minecraft zombie

1186
01:06:31,100 --> 01:06:35,720
That's pretty good

1187
01:06:35,720 --> 01:06:42,800
Fuck you

1188
01:06:49,880 --> 01:06:51,880
Okay, you can understand me

1189
01:06:51,880 --> 01:06:54,600
What do you need down here?

1190
01:06:54,600 --> 01:06:59,560
Do you need snacks are you hungry?

1191
01:06:59,560 --> 01:07:09,880
You see it rub its stomach oh he's hungry okay, and then point at you I

1192
01:07:09,880 --> 01:07:16,120
Know it's getting hot in yes, uh-uh

1193
01:07:18,440 --> 01:07:21,080
That's not gonna happen. What if I get you?

1194
01:07:21,080 --> 01:07:26,380
What if I call a delivery? What if I get something delivered here?

1195
01:07:26,380 --> 01:07:30,320
And you eat that instead and you

1196
01:07:30,320 --> 01:07:34,520
Leave us alone

1197
01:07:34,520 --> 01:07:40,920
You see it go like like maybe what about a pizza party?

1198
01:07:40,920 --> 01:07:44,280
And

1199
01:07:44,280 --> 01:07:46,280
You see it

1200
01:07:46,280 --> 01:07:50,580
Take a bunch of mud and like put it on the wall and start drawing

1201
01:07:50,580 --> 01:07:54,800
Pizza with mud and sticks and twigs and it has your face on it

1202
01:07:54,800 --> 01:08:01,400
No, what about a cheese pizza

1203
01:08:01,400 --> 01:08:04,880
His name's cheese, by the way

1204
01:08:04,880 --> 01:08:12,680
You see him like look for something like yellowish or whitish and just put it on the

1205
01:08:13,320 --> 01:08:15,000
the my pizza

1206
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:18,400
so you would accept that she's pizza

1207
01:08:18,400 --> 01:08:24,680
i started a really hungry when i see them but pizza on the road

1208
01:08:24,680 --> 01:08:30,720
and what about a pepperoni and she had a next person's turn

1209
01:08:30,720 --> 01:08:32,760
and then wait no that

1210
01:08:32,760 --> 01:08:37,640
i think i think it's distracted and i go for a pokey surprise okay so you gotta

1211
01:08:37,640 --> 01:08:39,040
run

1212
01:08:39,040 --> 01:08:40,640
of him

1213
01:08:40,640 --> 01:08:42,040
So how far are you?

1214
01:08:42,040 --> 01:08:44,440
35 feet.

1215
01:08:44,440 --> 01:08:48,160
Yeah, but you're, you could be within five feet of it.

1216
01:08:48,160 --> 01:08:48,840
Okay.

1217
01:08:48,840 --> 01:08:50,080
I think, yeah, right up there.

1218
01:08:50,080 --> 01:08:50,640
If you move there.

1219
01:08:50,640 --> 01:08:52,320
All right.

1220
01:08:52,320 --> 01:08:55,040
That's a cool.

1221
01:08:55,040 --> 01:08:55,640
Holy shit.

1222
01:08:55,640 --> 01:08:57,040
You got a grit 28.

1223
01:08:57,040 --> 01:08:58,080
You're going to kill yourself.

1224
01:08:58,080 --> 01:08:59,000

Yeah.

1231
01:09:04,240 --> 01:09:08,920
So it was like, it was like gesturing to the pizza drawing it made.

1232
01:09:08,920 --> 01:09:12,100
you see it like it was like putting his hand on his chin and just sort of

1233
01:09:12,100 --> 01:09:16,120
assessing like oh maybe a little bit this look you just run up to him and just hit

1234
01:09:16,120 --> 01:09:21,120

1235
01:09:21,120 --> 01:09:26,320

1236
01:09:26,320 --> 01:09:35,560
you don't take any damage from that you just get a new it in the mouth okay so

1237
01:09:35,560 --> 01:09:38,920
So what happens to the zombie creature?

1238
01:09:38,920 --> 01:09:42,240
He's hurt bad, you fucking like spun his head around, but he's still alive.

1239
01:09:42,240 --> 01:09:43,240
Do I have another move?

1240
01:09:43,240 --> 01:09:44,240
You have another attack, absolutely.

1241
01:09:44,240 --> 01:09:45,240
Alright, then I'm just gonna hit it again.

1242
01:09:45,240 --> 01:09:46,240

01:09:59,120 --> 01:10:03,240
And it's still up, but it's not looking hot.

1249
01:10:03,240 --> 01:10:05,240

1250
01:10:05,240 --> 01:10:12,240

Full damage. So let's see. Let's see how you do

1293
01:12:21,820 --> 01:12:24,140
hopefully

1294
01:12:24,140 --> 01:12:26,140

It's not gonna totally kill you though. So you'll be fine

1297
01:12:33,820 --> 01:12:38,380
You do take however ten damage and you take five

1298
01:12:38,380 --> 01:12:44,720
Can I kind of convince myself that I jumped on the grenade to say yes, Sullivan

1299
01:12:44,720 --> 01:12:50,740
Yeah, yeah, you see the new Sullivan and he's just like posing in the back and just like Sullivan

1300
01:12:50,740 --> 01:12:52,740

You're gonna start doing death saves you see what happens. All right, that's annoying wait

1306
01:13:08,900 --> 01:13:11,960
That's really not good cuz now if we kill try and hurt

1307
01:13:11,960 --> 01:13:15,060

01:13:15,060 --> 01:13:18,340
Then it's gonna kill him. Yeah, nobody else can hit it

1309
01:13:18,340 --> 01:13:20,580
Mm-hmm

1310
01:13:20,580 --> 01:13:22,580
So we're kind of fucked

1311
01:13:22,580 --> 01:13:24,840
You got a heel Caleb next time

1315
01:13:41,480 --> 01:13:47,440

1316
01:13:47,440 --> 01:13:52,680

1319
01:14:03,600 --> 01:14:14,940

1320
01:14:14,940 --> 01:14:15,940
blowtoss this.

1321
01:14:15,940 --> 01:14:18,940
Oh, let's see how it do.

1322
01:14:18,940 --> 01:14:21,940
Holy shit, it got a crit also.

1323
01:14:21,940 --> 01:14:22,940
Oh my god.

1324
01:14:22,940 --> 01:14:23,940
Okay.

1325
01:14:23,940 --> 01:14:25,940
Are we gonna all die right here?

1326
01:14:25,940 --> 01:14:26,940
Maybe.

1327
01:14:26,940 --> 01:14:30,940
Does 19 damage to the tower?

1328
01:14:30,940 --> 01:14:31,940
Yeah.

1329
01:14:31,940 --> 01:14:33,940
What if it doesn't do that?

1330
01:14:33,940 --> 01:14:34,940
No, it does.

1331
01:14:34,940 --> 01:14:37,940
Can you hit me with a Borat Knot right now?

1332
01:14:37,940 --> 01:14:40,940
When I, also I have an ability, when I take damage I turn invisible.

1333
01:14:40,940 --> 01:14:41,940
Mm-hmm.

1334
01:14:41,940 --> 01:14:43,940
So you turn blurry, yeah, you're invisible.

1335
01:14:43,940 --> 01:14:47,940
So, now, it's back to the top of the order.

1336
01:14:47,940 --> 01:14:51,940
Your turn, Blotas.

1337
01:14:51,940 --> 01:14:55,940
Okay, um... - These doppelgangers are no joke.

1338
01:14:55,940 --> 01:14:59,940
Do I get bonus damage if I attack from being invisible?

1339
01:14:59,940 --> 01:15:03,940
Is that like a sneak attack thing? - Yes.

1340
01:15:03,940 --> 01:15:07,940
If they don't see you, then you're gonna add... I will let you, because you're kind of a rogue class,

1341
01:15:07,940 --> 01:15:11,940
add sneak attack dice. - Okay, I vaguely remember that from reading

1342
01:15:11,940 --> 01:15:13,940
the players handbook in fourth grade.

1343
01:15:13,940 --> 01:15:15,940
Yeah, for sure.

1344
01:15:15,940 --> 01:15:17,940
You're gonna have to explain that to me.

1345
01:15:17,940 --> 01:15:19,940
I will.

1346
01:15:19,940 --> 01:15:21,940
Okay, I'm gonna go to the guy who's me.

1347
01:15:21,940 --> 01:15:23,940
Okay, so first do a stealth check to see if they...

1348
01:15:23,940 --> 01:15:25,940
but like with advantage, because you're invisible.

1349
01:15:25,940 --> 01:15:29,940
Yeah, thank God.

1350
01:15:29,940 --> 01:15:31,940
That was a close one.

1351
01:15:31,940 --> 01:15:33,940
Yeah, it was a crit one otherwise.

1352
01:15:33,940 --> 01:15:35,940
Okay, let's see how it does in perceiving you.

1353
01:15:35,940 --> 01:15:37,940
What's your...

1354
01:15:37,940 --> 01:15:39,940
perception?

1355
01:15:39,940 --> 01:15:44,940
Okay, yeah. It does not seem to sense you. It's like trying to find you. It's like looking for you.

1356
01:15:44,940 --> 01:15:53,940
But it can't find you. So, for you, you're going to add 3d6 to the damage you do right now.

1357
01:15:53,940 --> 01:15:56,940
Okay, do I get advantage on the attack?

1358
01:15:56,940 --> 01:15:59,940
Oh yeah.

1359
01:15:59,940 --> 01:16:00,940
Okay.

1360
01:16:00,940 --> 01:16:01,940
Oh yeah.

1361
01:16:01,940 --> 01:16:06,940
I'm going to use my dual pipes here. 23.

1362
01:16:06,940 --> 01:16:08,940
Oh yeah. That hits, baby.

1363
01:16:08,940 --> 01:16:22,820
the

1364
01:16:22,820 --> 01:16:34,740
the

1365
01:16:34,740 --> 01:16:36,740
So yeah, you have another attack obviously still.

1366
01:16:36,740 --> 01:16:40,740
Yeah, I'm gonna just use my dual pipes again I think.

1367
01:16:40,740 --> 01:16:41,740
Do it.

1368
01:16:41,740 --> 01:16:42,740
26.

1369
01:16:42,740 --> 01:16:43,740
Yeah, that hits.

1370
01:16:43,740 --> 01:16:44,740
15.

1371
01:16:44,740 --> 01:16:48,540
Fuck yeah, yeah, you just beat the shit out of it even more and it's not looking good

1372
01:16:48,540 --> 01:16:51,260
either.

1373
01:16:51,260 --> 01:16:57,580
All three of them now are not looking too good, but particularly Zombie Yoda and Zombie

1374
01:16:57,580 --> 01:16:58,580
Who.

1375
01:16:58,580 --> 01:17:01,620
I also I'm gonna teleport I think

1376
01:17:01,620 --> 01:17:09,980
To further away from everyone else so that they can't hit us all with a grenade again. Mm-hmm. Okay, you're up

1377
01:17:09,980 --> 01:17:14,120
Patrick Yoda. All right. Well, I'm just gonna beat the shit out of this guy

1378
01:17:14,120 --> 01:17:20,840
You got a heel Caleb. He's oh, yeah, I guess you could do this first. How many years you need to move?

1379
01:17:20,840 --> 01:17:28,060
To act to to attack actions you can do so if you use a spell then that's like the only spell you can use

1380
01:17:28,060 --> 01:17:43,060
is

1381
01:17:43,060 --> 01:18:06,620
are

1382
01:18:06,620 --> 01:18:12,600
that up with Crud or Sullivan. Sullivan. Okay. Yeah, you have to teach him how to sight. How

1383
01:18:12,600 --> 01:18:19,860
to fight. Do it very quickly. Yeah, well, he just watched me just do some. He's a very

1384
01:18:19,860 --> 01:18:24,740
fast learner. He just knows how to pose and have good time right now. I love him. Don't

1385
01:18:24,740 --> 01:18:29,620
make him. No, yeah, I'm not mad at him at all. I'm smiling as I'm dying. He's doing

1386
01:18:29,620 --> 01:18:31,620
He's like a silly little dance, he's like "ohhh"

1387
01:18:31,620 --> 01:18:33,620
I'm just like "huh huh huh"

1388
01:18:33,620 --> 01:18:35,620
"huh huh huh"

1389
01:18:35,620 --> 01:18:37,620
As I'm bleeding out

1390
01:18:37,620 --> 01:18:39,620
I'm like just "huh huh huh"

1391
01:18:39,620 --> 01:18:41,620
Cause I'm looking at him

1392
01:18:41,620 --> 01:18:43,620
I'm knocked out, I can't see him

1393
01:18:43,620 --> 01:18:45,620
But then there's a dream bubble that pops up

1394
01:18:45,620 --> 01:18:47,620
And he's doing the same thing in my dream

1395
01:18:47,620 --> 01:18:53,620
Alright, so

1396
01:18:53,620 --> 01:18:57,620
Should I use the foreskin first or should I just do Hoagie Surprise?

1397
01:18:57,620 --> 01:19:00,420
I say do Hoagie Surprise just to get this one out of the way.

1398
01:19:00,420 --> 01:19:00,920
Okay.

1399
01:19:00,920 --> 01:19:01,420
Mm-hmm.

1400
01:19:01,420 --> 01:19:04,120
Fourteen.

1401
01:19:04,120 --> 01:19:06,420
Bad hits.

1402
01:19:06,420 --> 01:19:08,520
For six damage.

1403
01:19:08,520 --> 01:19:09,120
Nice.

1404
01:19:09,120 --> 01:19:12,620
Yeah, you whack it again in its side.

1405
01:19:12,620 --> 01:19:15,620
But yeah, it's still up.

1406
01:19:15,620 --> 01:19:17,120
You have another attack, obviously.

1407
01:19:17,120 --> 01:19:20,420
Okay, so that attack would not count for my spell.

1408
01:19:20,420 --> 01:19:24,120
No, but that's your action then.

1409
01:19:24,120 --> 01:19:26,320
So you can't then do a spell.

1410
01:19:27,020 --> 01:19:36,020
So the way 5e works is it's like, if you have an extra attack, you can attack and then do an extra attack, and that's using your action for that.

1411
01:19:36,020 --> 01:19:39,020
Or you can use your action for a spell.

1412
01:19:39,020 --> 01:19:44,020
Okay, then I'll use the... So, wait, do I even need to, or is Caleb healed now?

1413
01:19:44,020 --> 01:19:45,020
Caleb is not healed.

1414
01:19:45,020 --> 01:19:48,020
You can't do an attack and a spell. You can only attack or do a spell.

1415
01:19:48,020 --> 01:19:51,020
You can only attack or do a spell.

1416
01:19:51,020 --> 01:19:54,020
So you have to... Just attack. That's all you can do.

1417
01:19:54,020 --> 01:19:56,020
Okay, then I'm just gonna attack.

1418
01:19:56,020 --> 01:20:09,900
the

1419
01:20:09,900 --> 01:20:16,900
and

1420
01:20:16,900 --> 01:20:17,400
bad.

1421
01:20:17,400 --> 01:20:20,600
What?

1422
01:20:20,600 --> 01:20:24,700
No, no, no, no, the zombie looks really bad.

1423
01:20:24,700 --> 01:20:32,500
It's it's like near dead near near, you know, near undead

1424
01:20:32,500 --> 01:20:35,200
folks, but it's still up.

1425
01:20:35,200 --> 01:20:40,700
Now, Stoogey Boogey is going to spring into action.

1426
01:20:42,300 --> 01:20:47,300
So you see him dash like pretty freakishly quick

1427
01:20:47,300 --> 01:20:54,100
towards the zombie Yoda and he turns to you, Patrick Yoda,

1428
01:20:54,100 --> 01:20:56,600
and he says, this is gonna hurt you.

1429
01:20:56,600 --> 01:20:57,100
Okay.

1430
01:20:57,100 --> 01:20:59,300
No, don't hurt.

1431
01:20:59,300 --> 01:21:09,200
Why? And he just says that and then gets a hit and does.

1432
01:21:10,900 --> 01:21:12,900
Yeah, it just snaps to Yoda's neck.

1433
01:21:12,900 --> 01:21:17,140
And you take seven damage from that.

1434
01:21:17,140 --> 01:21:19,140
But it's dead.

1435
01:21:19,140 --> 01:21:20,680
Damn.

1436
01:21:20,680 --> 01:21:22,500
Yes. Sorry.

1437
01:21:22,500 --> 01:21:24,900
He could not rescap it, I believe.

1438
01:21:24,900 --> 01:21:27,240
Ow!

1439
01:21:27,240 --> 01:21:28,980
Yeah, yeah.

1440
01:21:28,980 --> 01:21:29,620
Fuck!

1441
01:21:29,620 --> 01:21:33,300
Your neck just like, like whips around and then comes back.

1442
01:21:33,300 --> 01:21:38,420
Yeah, and that's, that's Stoogey Boogey's turn.

1443
01:21:38,420 --> 01:21:44,340
now it is the who and the the zombie who in the zombie computer hack demons turn

1444
01:21:44,340 --> 01:21:47,860
the zombie computer hack demon is going to turn around

1445
01:21:47,860 --> 01:21:51,540
to face you patricota and snitchy boochies and it's going to use matrix

1446
01:21:51,540 --> 01:21:54,260
beam or it's evil matrix beam where the

1447
01:21:54,260 --> 01:21:57,540
numbers are not zeros and ones but every other number but

1448
01:21:57,540 --> 01:22:03,780
um and so you two roll a dexterity saving throw

1449
01:22:03,940 --> 01:22:04,940
6.

1450
01:22:04,940 --> 01:22:08,820
Dude, this is so bad.

1451
01:22:08,820 --> 01:22:10,820
If you die, I don't have any healing.

1452
01:22:10,820 --> 01:22:18,380
Okay, and we're gonna have Tsuchibuchi's roll 1.

1453
01:22:18,380 --> 01:22:23,220
Okay, and let's see how much damage we do here.

1454
01:22:23,220 --> 01:22:26,220
Okay, alright, not bad.

1455
01:22:26,220 --> 01:22:27,220
We got a pretty bad roll.

1456
01:22:27,220 --> 01:22:29,220
So you take 12.

1457
01:22:29,220 --> 01:22:30,220
Fuck.

1458
01:22:30,220 --> 01:22:34,220
fuck and such a beauty six six so he is

1459
01:22:34,220 --> 01:22:36,940

1460
01:22:36,940 --> 01:22:39,780
uh...

1461
01:22:39,780 --> 01:22:41,780
okay

1462
01:22:41,780 --> 01:22:43,460
now

1463
01:22:43,460 --> 01:22:45,120
it is uh...

1464
01:22:45,120 --> 01:22:47,260
uh... the zombie who's turn

1465
01:22:47,260 --> 01:22:48,860
and it's gonna run over

1466
01:22:48,860 --> 01:22:52,180

1467
01:22:52,180 --> 01:22:53,940

1469
01:22:55,620 --> 01:22:57,060
it doesn't even

1470
01:22:57,060 --> 01:22:59,580
notice it hits

1471
01:22:59,580 --> 01:23:14,100
I

1472
01:23:14,100 --> 01:23:32,780
I

1473
01:23:32,780 --> 01:23:45,220
the

1474
01:23:45,220 --> 01:23:45,720
*slap*

1475
01:23:45,720 --> 01:23:46,220
You're down.

1476
01:23:46,220 --> 01:23:48,680
You're knocked out.

1477
01:23:48,680 --> 01:23:49,480
Oh no...

1478
01:23:49,480 --> 01:23:50,880
Dude, I don't have any healing!

1479
01:23:50,880 --> 01:23:53,080
I believe in Sullivan.

1480
01:23:53,080 --> 01:23:55,920
*laughter*

1481
01:23:55,920 --> 01:23:58,040
It's like just, like,

1482
01:23:58,040 --> 01:24:01,080
putting its finger on its nipples and just doing little circles.

1483
01:24:01,080 --> 01:24:01,580
*laughter*

1484
01:24:01,580 --> 01:24:03,860
Like, "Oh yeah! Woo!"

1485
01:24:03,860 --> 01:24:07,860
*laughter*

1486
01:24:07,860 --> 01:24:11,280
Its brain is just bouncing around in the water bottle on top of its head.

1487
01:24:11,280 --> 01:24:12,500
*laughter*

1488
01:24:12,500 --> 01:24:13,780
You- you funny.

1489
01:24:13,780 --> 01:24:26,220
the

1490
01:24:26,220 --> 01:24:29,220
Let's go!

1491
01:24:29,220 --> 01:24:32,220
Alright, and back to the top of the order.

1492
01:24:32,220 --> 01:24:35,220
Blotoss, it's your turn.

1493
01:24:35,220 --> 01:24:41,220
Okay, has any damage been done to the RayWilliamJohnson skeleton?

1494
01:24:41,220 --> 01:24:43,220
Yeah, you beat the shit out of him.

1495
01:24:43,220 --> 01:24:45,220
You're 22 to him.

1496
01:24:45,220 --> 01:24:47,220
Oh yeah, okay.

1497
01:24:47,220 --> 01:24:50,220
But if I hit him, it will kill.

1498
01:24:50,220 --> 01:24:53,220
Alright, so I guess...

1499
01:24:53,220 --> 01:24:56,220
And I don't have anything that can heal. Can I...

1500
01:24:56,220 --> 01:25:00,220
Is there any way I can heal, do any healing?

1501
01:25:00,220 --> 01:25:03,220
Can I do like a medicine check to heal somebody?

1502
01:25:03,220 --> 01:25:06,220
You can do that to stabilize somebody.

1503
01:25:06,220 --> 01:25:08,220
Okay.

1504
01:25:08,220 --> 01:25:17,220
Well, I guess for now I'll kill my skeleton, because nobody's going to be dying for three turns anyway.

1505
01:25:17,220 --> 01:25:20,220
I'll have time to stabilize them, hopefully.

1506
01:25:20,220 --> 01:25:29,220
So I'll go up to my skeleton and I'll hit it with my dual pipes here.

1507
01:25:29,220 --> 01:25:32,220
11.

1508
01:25:32,220 --> 01:25:35,220
It's a miss. It gets out of the way.

1509
01:25:35,220 --> 01:25:37,220
I'll try again.

1510
01:25:37,220 --> 01:25:38,220
That hits!

1511
01:25:38,220 --> 01:25:39,220
19.

1512
01:25:39,220 --> 01:25:41,220
13 damage.

1513
01:25:41,220 --> 01:25:43,220
Oh yeah. Oh!

1514
01:25:43,220 --> 01:25:46,220
And that was after you did...

1515
01:25:46,220 --> 01:25:58,600
the

1516
01:25:58,600 --> 01:26:05,640
to it. I'm gonna die too. Straight up next turn. Okay. Um it's it's looking pretty bad but you did

1517
01:26:05,640 --> 01:26:13,240
a good number of damage to it. Um now Stoogey Boochies goes. Okay and it does land a hit on

1518
01:26:13,240 --> 01:26:21,560
uh let me see. Does it? Yeah lands a hit on. I was getting I was getting nervous there. It lands a hit

1519
01:26:21,560 --> 01:26:24,640
on uh... does not be a

1520
01:26:24,640 --> 01:26:25,920
uh...

1521
01:26:25,920 --> 01:26:28,200
and it says no it does not do prove

1523
01:26:30,400 --> 01:26:31,920
uh...

1524
01:26:31,920 --> 01:26:33,280
routine

1525
01:26:33,280 --> 01:26:34,720

and try to hurt the computer hack team in as well

1545
01:27:18,320 --> 01:27:19,840

And it tries to hit the computer hack demon and it misses

um

1549
01:27:31,640 --> 01:27:33,640
Uh, it misses though. Okay

01:28:43,980 --> 01:28:46,220
the

1573
01:28:46,220 --> 01:28:49,660
Nope. Nope. That's a win. Anything over a one is a win. Yeah.

1574
01:28:49,660 --> 01:28:52,780
No! That's a failure.

1575
01:28:52,780 --> 01:28:56,500
Alright, cool. So, next in top of the order, Blow Toss.

1576
01:28:56,500 --> 01:29:02,020
Well, I can't... I can't hit the Ray William Johnson or

1577
01:29:02,020 --> 01:29:06,620
he's gonna die. Or how low does his health have to go before he dies?

1578
01:29:06,620 --> 01:29:11,460
It'd be negative his total HP. So you should be good. I'm at negative nine right now.

1579
01:29:11,460 --> 01:29:16,020
And my total is 35. Oh, okay. Yeah, I'll sneak attack the

1580
01:29:16,020 --> 01:29:18,020
And I only get half damage, right?

1581
01:29:18,020 --> 01:29:19,020
Yep.

1582
01:29:19,020 --> 01:29:20,020
Okay.

1583
01:29:20,020 --> 01:29:21,020
Yeah.

1584
01:29:21,020 --> 01:29:27,020
Okay, I will roll my dual pipes with advantage, maybe?

1585
01:29:27,020 --> 01:29:29,020
Yeah, with advantage.

1586
01:29:29,020 --> 01:29:32,020
Because I'm invisible? 21?

1587
01:29:32,020 --> 01:29:39,020
Okay. Hold on. Before you do that, I want to make sure.

1588
01:29:41,020 --> 01:29:45,940
I was double-checking the ruling for hitting someone while they're unconscious in D&D

1589
01:29:45,940 --> 01:29:48,900
and

1590
01:29:48,900 --> 01:29:56,340
It instead I forgot to write D&D so I just googled hit someone while they're unconscious

1591
01:29:56,340 --> 01:30:00,100
And

1592
01:30:00,100 --> 01:30:03,020
We don't follow D&D we go by the real rules here

1593
01:30:04,740 --> 01:30:11,720
Okay, yeah, and I don't know about in real life but in D&D yeah, they automatically fail one death saving throw if you do that

1594
01:30:11,720 --> 01:30:16,420
What no, you didn't tell me that no, I'm learning now. I don't want to attack them

1595
01:30:16,420 --> 01:30:22,220
Because that's two and two he'll just die he could possibly just die. No, he only has one failure

1596
01:30:22,220 --> 01:30:26,820
Yeah, and then if I hit him he takes another failure and then at the end of the turn order he's rolling again

1597
01:30:26,820 --> 01:30:29,620
I'm not gonna hit him if it's gonna get a death saving if I

1598
01:30:29,620 --> 01:30:34,260
Just do it, dude. I'm gonna teleport over to him and no balls

1599
01:30:34,260 --> 01:30:41,260
balls

1600
01:30:41,260 --> 01:30:45,740
right there. No, I didn't. That's why I was like, he was like, no, he won't die yet. He

1601
01:30:45,740 --> 01:30:51,300
wanted to die. Caleb, you remember that? I'm going to never forget that. And I said, no,

1602
01:30:51,300 --> 01:30:57,100
I'm not going to hit slander. And I'm lucky dude. I'm I'm a, you can, I'm going to stabilize

1603
01:30:57,100 --> 01:31:02,020
a, a, okay. We're just going to hit him anyway, no matter whether I do or not. I'm going to

1604
01:31:02,020 --> 01:31:09,540
check 10. Perfect. That's exactly what you need to stabilize. What does he do? You're

1605
01:31:09,540 --> 01:31:23,540
just

1606
01:31:23,540 --> 01:31:30,540
still

1607
01:31:30,540 --> 01:31:31,040
I guess.

1608
01:31:31,040 --> 01:31:34,160
Uh, no, because, oh yeah, you will.

1609
01:31:34,160 --> 01:31:34,660
You'll be-

1610
01:31:34,660 --> 01:31:36,660
I'll come back for you, dude.

1611
01:31:36,660 --> 01:31:37,160
I'll come back.

1612
01:31:37,160 --> 01:31:37,660
Thanks, brother.

1613
01:31:37,660 --> 01:31:38,160
I'll get you.

1614
01:31:38,160 --> 01:31:38,660
Yeah.

1615
01:31:38,660 --> 01:31:39,160
Thank you, brother.

1616
01:31:39,160 --> 01:31:39,660
Okay.

1617
01:31:39,660 --> 01:31:42,660
So, Stoogey Boochies is gonna try to hit this guy.

1618
01:31:42,660 --> 01:31:44,660
[laughter]

1619
01:31:44,660 --> 01:31:47,160
And he misses, so kinda lucky you.

1620
01:31:47,160 --> 01:31:49,660
And he's gonna try again, though.

1621
01:31:49,660 --> 01:31:52,160
And he misses again.

1622
01:31:52,160 --> 01:31:54,660
So he just like, [makes a noise]

1623
01:31:54,660 --> 01:31:57,160
And this computer-hacked demon is just parrying every blow.

1624
01:31:57,160 --> 01:32:01,540
And now he's gonna go and he's gonna swing back at the stoogey boochies again

1625
01:32:01,540 --> 01:32:04,440
and he misses

1626
01:32:04,440 --> 01:32:09,360
But he's gonna try again a lot of parrying just going on here and he hits god damn

1627
01:32:09,360 --> 01:32:15,680
Jesus

1628
01:32:15,680 --> 01:32:21,920
Soochie boochies is just is hanging on. He's not looking too good though

1629
01:32:23,520 --> 01:32:27,740
And now Patrick Yoda and Ray Williams Patrick Yoda death saving throw

1630
01:32:27,740 --> 01:32:31,200
15 nice, baby. All right, you're doing okay

1631
01:32:31,200 --> 01:32:34,920
Alright, I'm just like

1632
01:32:34,920 --> 01:32:40,600
People when you're on God just you're whining

1633
01:32:40,600 --> 01:32:44,520
All right blow toss

1634
01:32:44,520 --> 01:32:48,040
I

1635
01:32:48,640 --> 01:32:51,840
I guess now that Patrick's so close to stabilizing, I'm gonna hit...

1636
01:32:51,840 --> 01:32:53,920
I'm gonna sneak attack...

1637
01:32:53,920 --> 01:32:56,640
- Do it. - ...the skeleton.

1638
01:32:56,640 --> 01:32:59,720
- With my dual pipes. - Do it!

1639
01:32:59,720 --> 01:33:01,120
- 17. - That hits.

1640
01:33:01,120 --> 01:33:06,080
- Do I get sneak attack damage? - Yep, add that 3d6.

1641
01:33:06,080 --> 01:33:10,880
19 damage.

1642
01:33:10,880 --> 01:33:12,840
Yeah.

1643
01:33:12,840 --> 01:33:16,680
- This guy's dead. You killed him. - Yes, dude.

1644
01:33:17,840 --> 01:33:22,000
really is not a no-no it's the area you have you so you just like

1645
01:33:22,000 --> 01:33:22,800
you like

1646
01:33:22,800 --> 01:33:25,400
in theory after this grueling fight to start

1647
01:33:25,400 --> 01:33:27,000
bailing on this guy like

1648
01:33:27,000 --> 01:33:27,680
uh...

1649
01:33:27,680 --> 01:33:28,280
uh...

1650
01:33:28,280 --> 01:33:31,480
with him he will be with me in johnson is over the side like

1651
01:33:31,480 --> 01:33:34,520
weekly just like anybody else

1652
01:33:34,520 --> 01:33:36,720
is not the graphic of the house

1653
01:33:36,720 --> 01:33:39,080
the beginning it also

1654
01:33:39,080 --> 01:33:41,600
and this guy's dead

1655
01:33:41,600 --> 01:33:44,040
as soon as you kill this guy

1656
01:33:44,040 --> 01:33:48,480
uh... obviously really johnson you take a death saving throw uh... your

1657
01:33:48,480 --> 01:33:50,240
your you you you have one

1658
01:33:50,240 --> 01:33:53,080
negative you don't seem to know but you guys are about to have infinite medicine

1659
01:33:53,080 --> 01:33:55,740
checks basically we have a failure

1660
01:33:55,740 --> 01:33:59,640
uh... you guys are alive again uh... well well not quite we still have to do

1661
01:33:59,640 --> 01:34:00,840
health

1662
01:34:00,840 --> 01:34:05,280
we still need to do initiative stuff to to resolve the medicine check so

1663
01:34:05,280 --> 01:34:06,560
uh...

1664
01:34:06,560 --> 01:34:09,040
first thing is to keep it is is going to run over

1665
01:34:09,040 --> 01:34:16,040
to you ray william johnson and try to stabilize you

1666
01:34:16,040 --> 01:34:18,560
he does he stabilizes you

1667
01:34:18,560 --> 01:34:21,640
patrick you're all noticing them

1668
01:34:21,640 --> 01:34:23,720
fourteen you're stabilized

1669
01:34:23,720 --> 01:34:26,940
yes yes and you two are both stabilized

1670
01:34:26,940 --> 01:34:29,640
and then you you turn blowtoss like you're like

1671
01:34:29,640 --> 01:34:32,800
pop panting exhausted and you look over you see

1672
01:34:32,800 --> 01:34:36,620
uh... sold in the frog doing his little dances and stuff

1673
01:34:36,620 --> 01:34:40,060
and here through the window you see he's dancing in front of the point all year

1674
01:34:40,060 --> 01:34:41,020
all haha

1675
01:34:41,020 --> 01:34:42,460
and watch

1676
01:34:42,460 --> 01:34:43,460
as it one

1677
01:34:43,460 --> 01:34:46,420
turns to a zero

1678
01:34:46,420 --> 01:34:49,980
and here's something

1679
01:34:49,980 --> 01:34:50,620
from like

1680
01:34:50,620 --> 01:34:53,460
way way way back up

1681
01:34:53,460 --> 01:34:56,780
a crowd what's going on over there

1682
01:34:56,780 --> 01:34:58,220
can hear you

1683
01:34:58,220 --> 01:34:59,220
cried

1684
01:34:59,220 --> 01:35:01,460
well if you could hear it before

1685
01:35:01,460 --> 01:35:04,940
growing halfway down the slide crowd

1686
01:35:04,940 --> 01:35:06,340
crud

1687
01:35:06,340 --> 01:35:08,260
we're doing like a great thing

1688
01:35:08,260 --> 01:35:10,260
i guess i think i hear you it

1689
01:35:10,260 --> 01:35:11,820
yeah you know it's a little

1690
01:35:11,820 --> 01:35:13,180
uh... what

1691
01:35:13,180 --> 01:35:17,620
after that fight i'm not i think every inch i can get it here

1692
01:35:17,620 --> 01:35:19,020
what

1693
01:35:19,020 --> 01:35:21,940
what's going on up there is a

1694
01:35:21,940 --> 01:35:23,780
uh...

1695
01:35:23,780 --> 01:35:25,320
not nothing

1696
01:35:25,320 --> 01:35:26,940
and i've been up there

1697
01:35:26,940 --> 01:35:29,260
he's been a role investigation check

1698
01:35:29,260 --> 01:35:30,740
uh... no

1699
01:35:30,740 --> 01:35:34,300
now he's pretty good at either the other system

1700
01:35:34,300 --> 01:35:41,020
I mean, I can't make this fucking up.

1701
01:35:41,020 --> 01:35:42,020
Like god damn.

1702
01:35:42,020 --> 01:35:44,740
Oh my god dude, this is the most evil session of the game we've ever played.

1703
01:35:44,740 --> 01:35:46,220
I hate crud so much.

1704
01:35:46,220 --> 01:35:47,220
Oh my god.

1705
01:35:47,220 --> 01:35:49,900
Dude, this roll 20 is punishing us for going to the stretcher.

1706
01:35:49,900 --> 01:35:51,900
Yeah, definitely.

1707
01:35:51,900 --> 01:35:55,900
Okay, he's like, "Oh, I don't know.

1708
01:35:55,900 --> 01:35:58,100
I'm sorry.

1709
01:35:58,100 --> 01:35:59,100
I don't know really."

1710
01:35:59,100 --> 01:36:00,100
What?

1711
01:36:00,100 --> 01:36:01,100
I don't know what's going on.

1712
01:36:01,100 --> 01:36:02,100
What do you mean you don't know?

1713
01:36:02,100 --> 01:36:03,100
I don't know what's going on!

1714
01:36:03,100 --> 01:36:04,700
What do you mean you don't know?

1715
01:36:04,700 --> 01:36:06,380
Do you have fucking eyes?

1716
01:36:06,380 --> 01:36:09,300
I'm coming back up there!

1717
01:36:09,300 --> 01:36:13,900
You try to walk up, it just keeps sliding down.

1718
01:36:13,900 --> 01:36:15,660
I hoverboard up.

1719
01:36:15,660 --> 01:36:18,260
You guys should like rest and restore some health too.

1720
01:36:18,260 --> 01:36:21,020
I'm gonna hoverboard up and then rest in the living room here.

1721
01:36:21,020 --> 01:36:23,500
Yeah, I don't want to rest in this nasty mud.

1722
01:36:23,500 --> 01:36:24,500
Yeah.

1723
01:36:24,500 --> 01:36:25,500
What do you mean?

1724
01:36:25,500 --> 01:36:26,500
It's comfortable.

1725
01:36:26,500 --> 01:36:27,500
You're right, I rest.

1726
01:36:27,500 --> 01:36:33,500
I lie on top of of Ray William Johnson like a blanket. I die

1727
01:36:33,500 --> 01:36:37,900
against to. Okay. I'm resting too. Okay. I don't think we

1728
01:36:37,900 --> 01:36:41,020
really had the option to rest but I do it. Yeah, it's fine.

1729
01:36:41,020 --> 01:36:43,740
I'll let you guys rest. That was pretty that was pretty tough.

1730
01:36:43,740 --> 01:36:47,340
I just meant like a short rest but if we could take a long one

1731
01:36:47,340 --> 01:36:50,220
uh well that's 8 hours. We sleep through the night in the

1732
01:36:50,220 --> 01:36:54,700
mud. Yeah. I love the dungeon. Yeah. Are we not supposed to be

1733
01:36:54,700 --> 01:36:59,980
able to short rest right now? I thought we well so no I'll let you guys short rest I think that's I

1734
01:36:59,980 --> 01:37:04,140
hate that rule uh there's like a rule where it's like technically you're not supposed to short rest

1735
01:37:04,140 --> 01:37:12,060
like when you're um because short rest is like down time and so if you have to be conscious to rest

1736
01:37:12,060 --> 01:37:20,860
but if you're unconscious and you rest theoretically you should be like getting better

1737
01:37:20,860 --> 01:37:26,060
is how I see it. I guess it's not as realistic. Like maybe you would say, oh, do a short rest,

1738
01:37:26,060 --> 01:37:30,780
but like take like only a quarter of the health you get back because it's not as well rested,

1739
01:37:30,780 --> 01:37:33,900
or I don't know what I would do, but I'm just going to do. It's a short rest for you guys.

1740

01:38:56,260 --> 01:39:00,260
Okay, so you spent 5, so

1757

take 5 away from your total of hit dice as well.

1758
01:39:04,260 --> 01:39:08,260
Okay.

1759
01:39:08,260 --> 01:39:15,840
All right, so you guys rested in the mud for about a very after a very grueling fight with your doppelganger

1760
01:39:15,840 --> 01:39:19,680
The analogous the analogy

1761
01:39:19,680 --> 01:39:29,100
And you saw that thing turned to zero and you also what you didn't notice before you notice now

1762
01:39:29,100 --> 01:39:33,060
You see the wall over here

1763
01:39:35,120 --> 01:39:40,120
Which was you all thought was rock and mud like everything else so far in this temple you hear it go

1764
01:39:40,120 --> 01:39:45,000
And it opens and you see like a long staircase down

1765
01:39:45,000 --> 01:39:48,520
And

1766
01:39:48,520 --> 01:39:54,760
You see snitchy-boochies he's his eyes light up for a second he's like now these these I

1767
01:39:54,760 --> 01:40:01,140
Was confused these doesn't look like Tamagotchi that looks like Tamagotchi

1768
01:40:01,140 --> 01:40:04,620
We were in advanced people, but these all these rock

1769
01:40:04,620 --> 01:40:24,180
the

1770
01:40:24,180 --> 01:40:38,060
the

1771
01:40:38,060 --> 01:40:50,420
that

1772
01:40:50,420 --> 01:40:57,800
haven't seen this something like this it's like this chrome staircase but

1773
01:40:57,800 --> 01:41:04,480
it's like this with this gold rose gold hint to it it's quite pretty even though

1774
01:41:04,480 --> 01:41:12,400
it's like very dark as you look down further in there and and yeah I mean

1775
01:41:12,400 --> 01:41:16,900
that's really it. That's all you all you see so far.

1776
01:41:16,900 --> 01:41:24,500
Let's walk up the stairs. Do you do you mean down the stairs?

1777
01:41:24,500 --> 01:41:28,600
No, we'll go down and then walk back up. Okay. We'll try to

1778
01:41:28,600 --> 01:41:32,500
find some ups. Oh, okay. I think I I'll just start walking

1779
01:41:32,500 --> 01:41:36,300
down. Yeah. So you start walking down you guys as you walk

1780
01:41:36,300 --> 01:41:39,700
down the stairs. So as you guys walk down the stairs and you

1781
01:41:39,700 --> 01:41:45,060
hear your feet echo. You hear solving the frog echo is doing

1782
01:41:45,060 --> 01:41:51,860
his little dance moves and shaking and it opens up into

1783
01:41:51,860 --> 01:42:02,640
like this gorgeous. Vista of a city that is underground a

1784
01:42:02,640 --> 01:42:08,400
dilapidated city. It looks like a chrome like 60s like Sid

1785
01:42:08,400 --> 01:42:17,680
mead painting, like massive, like beautiful spires like that are just like buried in time

1786
01:42:17,680 --> 01:42:18,680
and decay.

1787
01:42:18,680 --> 01:42:26,120
And you see Tsuchi Buji says, "It's Tama Town."

1788
01:42:26,120 --> 01:42:27,120
Tomato Town?

1789
01:42:27,120 --> 01:42:28,120
