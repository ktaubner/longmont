Yo.

20
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:38,920
I'm surprised you fucking stupid bastard from Mexico.

21
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:40,560
Hold on.

22
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:44,360
Oh my god, look at that.

23
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:46,480
OK, would we like to go one by one?

24
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:47,880
Yeah, Rex, why don't you go first?

25
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:49,280
We could pick on this how you can.

26
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:55,120
You're completely muted.

27
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:56,040
I'm completely muted?

28
00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:58,300
(laughing)

29
00:00:58,300 --> 00:01:04,140
- Participant Rex is having a problem.

00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:06,400
(laughing)

31
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:10,640
- He's just muted, he can't hear a single word you're saying.

32
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:13,960
- Yeah, cannot read properties of ordified readings.

33
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:14,840
- All right. - Okay.

34
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:16,100
- Can you hear me again?

35
00:01:16,100 --> 00:01:17,920
- Yeah, you're very loud though.

36
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:19,640
- Oh my God, sorry.

37
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:20,480
- What about now?

38
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:21,800
- What's wrong with you?

39
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:23,080
- My microphone wasn't working.

40
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:24,080
- Oh no, it's so loud.

41
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:25,680
- You're so loud.

42
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:26,520
All right, what about now?

43
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:27,360
Really hot.

44
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:28,180
A little more.

45
00:01:28,180 --> 00:01:33,280
Let me make sure, I can't even touch my settings.

46
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:34,120
Okay.

47
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:35,160
What about now, is this fine?

48
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:36,040
Maybe that's fine.

49
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:37,520
Just talk there.

50
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:38,440
Okay.

51
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:41,160
Now, what beer have you brought today?

52
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:44,680
I have a delicious Bud Light.

53
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:47,800
I got a tall Bud Light.

54
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:49,840
A tall boy Bud Light?

55
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:50,800
Yeah.

56
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:52,160
What did you get?

57
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:54,520
Well, go ahead, take a sip and give us a review.

58
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:55,360
- Hmm.

59
00:01:55,360 --> 00:02:00,900
That's Bud Light, yum.

60
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:02,020
Four out of 10.

61
00:02:02,020 --> 00:02:03,100
- Four out of 10, okay.

62
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:04,700
What'd you bring, Jibya?

63
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:09,700
- I brought a tall can, tall blue can of Bud Light.

64
00:02:09,700 --> 00:02:13,300
- Hold the phone, what's going on here today?

65
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:16,580
- It's producing the choicest chops.

66
00:02:16,580 --> 00:02:19,260
- The choicest chops. - Choicest chops.

67
00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:21,060
- And barley malt.

68
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:22,700
- And rice. - And rice.

69
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:25,020
Wait, how did you know that?

70
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:27,660
- Well guys, let me show you why.

71
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:31,700
Because I too have a tall boy butt.

72
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:32,540
(laughing)

73
00:02:32,540 --> 00:02:35,180
- Oh my God. - That's right.

74
00:02:35,180 --> 00:02:37,780
Always brewed using the choicest hops,

75
00:02:37,780 --> 00:02:40,860
best barley malt, and rice.

76
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:43,380
It doesn't say any, no kind of qualifier

77
00:02:43,380 --> 00:02:45,020
for how good the rice is though.

78
00:02:45,020 --> 00:02:46,860
- I don't think mine has any rice.

79
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:51,860
- The best hops, the best barley malt, and some rice.

80
00:02:51,860 --> 00:02:52,700
- I'm gonna take some rice.

81
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:53,540
- Well, hold on.

82
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:54,360
- I'm gonna take a sip.

83
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:58,620
- Hold on, what do you call a choice thing, the best thing?

84
00:02:58,620 --> 00:03:02,180
- Oh, oh, I'm sorry.

85
00:03:02,180 --> 00:03:06,860
I'm sorry, that is near orgasmic how amazing that beer is.

86
00:03:06,860 --> 00:03:11,820
I'm gonna give that, hold on, one more sip.

87
00:03:11,820 --> 00:03:13,820
- My dick could still come, I would definitely

88
00:03:13,820 --> 00:03:16,100
give that a 10 out of 10.

89
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:16,940
- What?

90
00:03:16,940 --> 00:03:19,940
- I'm gonna give that a six three.

91
00:03:19,940 --> 00:03:23,620
And the only reason it's not higher

92
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:28,620
is because a Bud Light tastes like a worse Coors Light,

93
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:29,860
if you ask me.

94
00:03:29,860 --> 00:03:32,020
It tastes like a watered down Coors Light.

95
00:03:32,020 --> 00:03:32,860
But it is a great beer.

96
00:03:32,860 --> 00:03:34,300
- Coors Light's a six five.

97
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:36,700
- A Coors Light is a seven on my scale.

98
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:37,540
I love a Coors Light.

99
00:03:37,540 --> 00:03:40,140
- Oh, I thought we were doing it on basketball heights.

100
00:03:40,140 --> 00:03:41,820
So it's like a five to--

101
00:03:41,820 --> 00:03:43,300
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

102
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:45,140
- Hang on, hang on.

103
00:03:45,140 --> 00:03:47,620
- Okay, okay, no, this is good.

104
00:03:47,620 --> 00:03:50,120
This is the new scale for beers we drank.

105
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:52,860
This is how, so who's the shortest basketball player ever?

106
00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:56,420
I think Muggsy Bogues, I think he was five foot three maybe?

107
00:03:56,420 --> 00:03:57,300
- Sure, yeah.

108
00:03:57,300 --> 00:04:02,300
- The tallest ever was maybe Bol, no sorry.

109
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:05,860
Maybe Manute Bol, he was seven foot seven.

110
00:04:05,860 --> 00:04:06,680
- Yeah.

111
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:07,660
- Something like that.

112
00:04:07,660 --> 00:04:09,940
So let's say five three to seven foot seven.

113
00:04:09,940 --> 00:04:11,340
So everybody let's go around

114
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:14,100
and redo our ratings for these beers.

115
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:15,900
- All the beers so far?

116
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:17,380
- I mean no, this beer.

117
00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:18,100
Just this beer.

118
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:19,340
Oh, OK.

119
00:04:19,340 --> 00:04:20,460
This isn't Eric Bledsoe.

120
00:04:20,460 --> 00:04:23,580
This is 6'2".

121
00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:27,700
I have to-- guys, I have to break the news to you guys.

122
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:28,200
Yep.

123
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:28,700
I never once--

124
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:30,100
You only know centimeters.

125
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:32,540
I never once in my life have ever watched

126
00:04:32,540 --> 00:04:34,980
a single second of NBA basketball.

127
00:04:34,980 --> 00:04:37,940
Well, you don't-- do you know what a height is?

128
00:04:37,940 --> 00:04:39,020
You can just say height.

129
00:04:39,020 --> 00:04:39,940
Michael Jordan.

130
00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:40,580
Michael Jordan.

131
00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:42,380
Michael Jordan is 6'6".

132
00:04:42,380 --> 00:04:44,100
Michael Jordan of beers, right here.

133
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:44,660
OK.

134
00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:46,060
Well, don't say that.

135
00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:49,000
This is a Steve Nash, six foot three,

136
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,860
cucked by his wife.

137
00:04:50,860 --> 00:04:52,300
He got cucked by his wife?

138
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:53,140
Yeah.

139
00:04:53,140 --> 00:04:53,980
Oh, poor Nash, dude.

140
00:04:53,980 --> 00:04:55,820
He had a hard life, man.

141
00:04:55,820 --> 00:04:56,660
He did.

142
00:04:56,660 --> 00:05:00,060
He lost out on an NBA championship,

143
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:02,820
and I guess he got cucked by his wife, I just found out.

144
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:04,500
Isn't that a coach?

145
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:05,340
Steve Nash?

146
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:06,180
Yeah, he's a coach now.

147
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:07,620
I think he's an assistant coach now.

148
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:09,780
Yeah, he got fired from being a head coach.

149
00:05:09,780 --> 00:05:13,940
Yeah, he used to be basically one of the best white boys

150
00:05:13,940 --> 00:05:15,260
to ever do it in the NBA.

151
00:05:15,260 --> 00:05:17,140
I would say probably the best.

152
00:05:17,140 --> 00:05:19,660
No, Larry Bird, the second best

153
00:05:19,660 --> 00:05:21,180
American white boy to ever play

154
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:22,780
in the NBA, probably.

155
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:24,060
OK.

156
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:25,060
And he's Canadian too.

157
00:05:25,060 --> 00:05:26,140
And how about this?

158
00:05:26,140 --> 00:05:27,140
God damn it!

159
00:05:27,140 --> 00:05:29,300
Fuck!

160
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:30,820
Non-European.

161
00:05:30,820 --> 00:05:32,940
Yeah, I knew what you meant.

162
00:05:32,940 --> 00:05:34,580
Yeah.

163
00:05:34,580 --> 00:05:37,420
So what is that your favorite

164
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:38,740
NBA player?

165
00:05:38,740 --> 00:05:39,540
Yeah.

166
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:41,380
No, my favorite NBA player is Mike

167
00:05:41,380 --> 00:05:42,380
Bibby.

168
00:05:42,380 --> 00:05:44,620
Look up a picture if you want to

169
00:05:44,620 --> 00:05:52,060
know why. Look up Mike Bibby. Kevin Love. Yeah, I like players like Mike Bibby, Kevin Love.

170
00:05:52,060 --> 00:06:03,140
Wait, hold on. Paul Wall. Paul Wall is a great player. No, John Wall, I'm sorry. John Wall

171
00:06:03,140 --> 00:06:09,740
is not white. I see. Yeah, Paul Wall is an American rapper. 100%. John Wall is a black

172
00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:16,740
guy who played for the Wizards. You are thinking of Paul Wall, the rapper.

173
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:18,880
I just assume all walls are white.

174
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:24,380
So where should one start if someone has never watched NBA basketball sport?

175
00:06:24,380 --> 00:06:30,320
Actually I have a good recommendation. The way I got into the NBA was by playing it but

176
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:35,120
also by playing NBA 2K. Because if you play 2K, I'm sure this is similar with like FIFA

177
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:36,080
or something.

178
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:39,960
You play 2K, you learn all the players

179
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:42,600
and all the rules and stuff.

180
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:45,440
And also you make a guy whose name is like

181
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:51,840
Mr. Krabs and you go 82 and O

182
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:54,040
and average 150 points a game.

183
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:56,080
It's like basically the most fun video game you can do.

184
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:58,880
- And you wish that there was a real life Mr. Krabs

185
00:06:58,880 --> 00:06:59,840
out there in the league.

186
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:01,560
- I literally, this is embarrassing to admit,

187
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:03,800
I pretty much every single time I've played,

188
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:07,320
I've made a My Character, My Player on NBA 2K.

189
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:11,560
I make a version of me, a guy who kinda looks like me,

190
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:14,660
but he's like six foot 11 and he's mixed.

191
00:07:14,660 --> 00:07:16,440
(laughing)

192
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:18,620
- Well I love that 2K has like an app

193
00:07:18,620 --> 00:07:20,680
that you can upload your face into.

194
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:22,200
- Yeah, I've never done that.

195
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:23,400
- Yeah, it doesn't work.

196
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:25,520
- Could you use it for like recreational use

197
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:28,680
and not to create a guy for 2K?

198
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:30,920
- Like can you scan your face with it for no reason?

199
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:33,320
Yeah, just like save the picture for no reason.

200
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:37,860
- Just take, you're saying you're inventing a photo app?

201
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:39,240
Where you take a photo of your face?

202
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:40,080
- No, no, no, no, no, no.

203
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:41,200
- Save the picture?

204
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:42,560
- A face scanning app.

205
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:43,400
- Oh, okay.

206
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:45,600
- That saves your face as a scan into a 2K player.

207
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:48,960
- I'm sure you could export it in some way.

208
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:51,440
Yeah, and then you could use a connect,

209
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:54,240
and then you could do some like,

210
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:56,840
a Planet of the Apes mo-cap kind of stuff.

211
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:59,000
- I've been thinking a lot about apps recently.

212
00:07:59,000 --> 00:07:59,840
- Why?

213
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:05,040
I think I'm gonna become an app sky. I told Rex about one of my ideas like a month ago

214
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:07,040
What was your idea?

215
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:09,040
I think I told you

216
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:11,040
like in the dead of night

217
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:13,040
in the middle of night

218
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:15,040
In the dead of night I told him about my app idea

219
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:17,040
Sorry I have a brain full of my own app ideas

220
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:19,040
Yeah

221
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:21,040
Which are better than yours

222
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:23,040
No I wanna hear yours

223
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:25,040
Okay do you wanna tell them what my idea was

224
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:27,040
No I don't remember

225
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:29,040
You tell it

226
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:31,400
I, in the middle of the night, I sent him,

227
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:33,280
Rex, we should make an app.

228
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:36,320
We should make a fax app.

229
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:37,920
And he was like, what is that?

230
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:39,520
And I was like, like a fax.

231
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:41,520
- F-A-C-T-S or F-A-X?

232
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:43,200
- F-A-X. - F-A-X, okay.

233
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:46,600
- Yeah, and he wasn't too, he didn't love it,

234
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:48,300
for, I could tell.

235
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:52,360
- For one, there is already an app

236
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:54,680
that you can use your phone to scan documents

237
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:56,120
and then send it as a PDF,

238
00:08:56,120 --> 00:09:00,120
which I think is quite literally what you're talking about.

239
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:02,020
- Well, but I guess the only thing would be

240
00:09:02,020 --> 00:09:04,700
that you could send it to a fax number.

241
00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:06,620
- Yeah, you could always send it to a username

242
00:09:06,620 --> 00:09:10,520
that you know on the community app, fax app.

243
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:12,560
- No, it wouldn't be a fax, no.

244
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:14,760
You're already ruining your app.

245
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:16,660
- How am I ruining it?

246
00:09:16,660 --> 00:09:18,560
- 'Cause you're making it not make any sense.

247
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:20,160
It's not a fax if it's just a thing

248
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:22,360
where you send people scans of documents

249
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:23,400
who also have the app.

250
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:25,200
It's not a fax at all.

251
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,160
I mean, that's true.

252
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:27,000
- This is awful.

253
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,960
I could use the fucking Notes app to scan a document.

254
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:31,800
- Yeah.

255
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:32,800
- I'm gonna be completely honest.

256
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:36,440
I thought at the time that the idea,

257
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:38,480
I had a good idea for an app,

258
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:40,480
but I don't really recall it correctly.

259
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:41,580
But I mean, I don't even really care

260
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:44,360
about the facts app that much, honestly.

261
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:47,700
I've just been brainstorming.

262
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:49,480
- Okay, what ideas do you have, Rex?

263
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:55,000
- My app that I truly want to make

264
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:58,000
is one that just applies to jobs for you.

265
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:58,840
Just use--

266
00:09:58,840 --> 00:09:59,960
- Oh, you've told me that before.

267
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:01,680
That is a genius idea.

268
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:03,960
- Yeah, yeah, just like a chat GPT thing

269
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:06,360
that fills out like a job application for you.

270
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:07,200
- Why not make that?

271
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:08,120
You know how to program.

272
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:09,720
It's easy.

273
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:11,840
- I told someone this and they said it already exists

274
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:15,560
and I tried to find it and I didn't find it.

275
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:17,400
But I do think it's a good idea.

276
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:21,960
I think I would pay like $5 a month.

277
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:24,520
- Like if Indeed offered that?

278
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:26,480
- Yeah, I feel like that's a no-brainer for,

279
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:29,000
if you could build it and then sell it to Indeed,

280
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:29,840
that'd be easy.

281
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:35,560
I have an idea for an app where you,

282
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:39,840
basically you can go on the app

283
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:43,280
and you can see all of your friends.

284
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:46,960
You can add friends, you can minus friends,

285
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:49,980
you can have a wall, a profile photo,

286
00:10:49,980 --> 00:10:52,340
and you can put your relationship status on it,

287
00:10:52,340 --> 00:10:54,020
but the catch is that you have to have

288
00:10:54,020 --> 00:10:57,840
a harvard.edu email address.

289
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:59,540
- That's really smart.

290
00:10:59,540 --> 00:11:01,320
- Do you think this is good?

291
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:04,400
- I think you will have to be learning Chinese, buddy.

292
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:05,580
- Oh shit!

293
00:11:05,580 --> 00:11:08,620
That already exists, doesn't it?

294
00:11:08,620 --> 00:11:09,620
- Yeah.

295
00:11:09,620 --> 00:11:11,460
- Oh shit.

296
00:11:11,460 --> 00:11:13,780
- I think you're gonna be excluding a lot of people

297
00:11:13,780 --> 00:11:14,820
with that idea.

298
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:15,940
- I think they should make that,

299
00:11:15,940 --> 00:11:19,140
but they should only allow Chinese people.

300
00:11:19,140 --> 00:11:23,640
It's all harvard.edu email addresses, but and then my email address. So when

301
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:29,360
they're talking about I'm studying for this bio Kim final, I can comment on

302
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:30,720
whatever I want and say sup

303
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:37,160
because wouldn't that be wouldn't that is that like the dream to be the face

304
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:42,360
or the myspace tom to just be able to just do whatever you know, everyone

305
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:46,560
hates you. Everyone hates the everyone loves tom. He was my first friend.

306
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:49,480
- You were not on MySpace.

307
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:50,520
You were not on MySpace.

308
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:52,280
- I was on MySpace, are you crazy?

309
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:55,120
- You were 17 years old right now.

310
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:57,600
- I was on MySpace, I was 11 years old.

311
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:00,860
I put my height as five foot three, it was a one inch lie.

312
00:12:00,860 --> 00:12:03,500
And I put my body type as more to love.

313
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:06,840
And my top eight--

314
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:07,980
- That's a one inch lie you've done.

315
00:12:07,980 --> 00:12:10,240
(laughing)

316
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:13,480
- My top eight was my brother,

317
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:19,200
Little John and my brother's friends.

318
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:20,300
- Nice. - Top three.

319
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:22,760
- Well, his friends were multiple.

320
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:24,680
- A bunch of, all of his friends.

321
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:25,520
- Oh, okay.

322
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:28,080
- Whatever, I think I only had 16 friends or something.

323
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:29,880
But I was really, I think I deactivated it

324
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:31,720
'cause I was scared of being molested

325
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:34,080
because my dad said that that could happen online.

326
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:36,320
- Which I don't think you would have had to worry about.

327
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:37,800
- No, it was more to love.

328
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:39,120
- Would either Rex or me make it

329
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:41,120
into your top eight these days?

330
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:42,600
- Top eight, oh, for sure.

331
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:44,420
- Thank you.

332
00:12:44,420 --> 00:12:48,300
- You know what, just because I know how you two are,

333
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:50,280
I would make you battle for the eighth spot.

334
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:51,320
- Yeah, I was gonna say.

335
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:52,940
There could only be one of us.

336
00:12:52,940 --> 00:12:54,980
- Yeah, 'cause it'd be kind of embarrassing

337
00:12:54,980 --> 00:12:58,760
if my top eight was like Cam, Pat, you two, Patches,

338
00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:02,020
Tom.

339
00:13:02,020 --> 00:13:02,860
- Yeah, Tom.

340
00:13:02,860 --> 00:13:05,500
Just round it out.

341
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:07,940
- I think it'd be funny if it was still just your brother

342
00:13:07,940 --> 00:13:10,020
and seven of his friends.

343
00:13:10,020 --> 00:13:11,300
They're not even your friends.

344
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:13,060
- I think it would be funny to have that

345
00:13:13,060 --> 00:13:14,960
and have it be all of us.

346
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:17,100
And then like Tom is the eighth

347
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:19,520
and then your wife just out.

348
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:22,980
- Yeah, she's, "Oh baby, you were nine, I'm sorry."

349
00:13:22,980 --> 00:13:26,700
Didn't Justin Timberlake buy MySpace at some point?

350
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:28,340
- No, he bought the music window.

351
00:13:28,340 --> 00:13:30,860
- I think he bought MySpace.

352
00:13:30,860 --> 00:13:34,320
- Well, I think MySpace turned into a music thing.

353
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:35,160
- Yeah.

354
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:36,820
- I remember I had this history teacher

355
00:13:36,820 --> 00:13:41,180
that would upload face-melting guitar solos.

356
00:13:41,180 --> 00:13:42,020
- I bet they were.

357
00:13:42,020 --> 00:13:44,820
We were friends with your teacher on Myspace?

358
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:46,320
No, but we all looked at it.

359
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:47,320
*burp*

360
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:49,320
Oh, you would go and find him?

361
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:51,320
Oh yeah, oh yeah.

362
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:55,320
He had one of those extremely Nazi-ass German names.

363
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:56,320
He was dope.

364
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:57,320
Yeah?

365
00:13:57,320 --> 00:14:00,320
He got stabbed in the head and his eye twitched.

366
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:00,820
What?

367
00:14:00,820 --> 00:14:03,320
And he spent all of his money on custom guitars.

368
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:05,320
And drank nothing but Mountain Dew. He was dope.

369
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:07,320
This guy is a beast.

370
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:08,320
Yeah.

371
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:09,320
Wait, what?

372
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:11,840
- At the front desk lady fired 'cause he fucked her

373
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:12,920
and they found out.

374
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:14,120
- Whoa!

375
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:14,960
- And he kept his job? - Wait, they fired her

376
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:16,040
for fucking her?

377
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:16,880
- Yeah, for fucking her.

378
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:17,720
- For fucking him?

379
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:18,840
- Yeah, yeah.

380
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:21,920
And he and her drove the same car, BMW Z3.

381
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:24,240
- That's why they had sex. - Fire, yep.

382
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:26,400
- You can have sex with almost anybody

383
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:28,080
that drives the same car as you.

384
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:28,920
- Yes.

385
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:30,200
- You have everything to talk about.

386
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:31,080
- Of course.

387
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:32,640
- Don't you wish the air conditioner,

388
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:35,280
don't you wish it got a little colder, a little faster?

389
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:37,640
- Don't you wish people would stop breaking into your car?

390
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:40,220
(laughter)

391
00:14:40,220 --> 00:14:41,220
- Licking your steering wheel?

392
00:14:41,220 --> 00:14:42,400
Don't you hate when your steering wheel

393
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:43,240
smells like my breath?

394
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:44,280
I mean, some guy's breath.

395
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:46,420
(laughter)

396
00:14:46,420 --> 00:14:49,620
- I saw a picture on Twitter that was like,

397
00:14:49,620 --> 00:14:52,960
it was like a note on someone's car that was like,

398
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:54,900
"I'm tired of breaking into cars.

399
00:14:54,900 --> 00:14:56,240
"Here's my cash app.

400
00:14:56,240 --> 00:15:00,080
"Just like, give me so I won't break into your car."

401
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:01,500
I was like, that's smart.

402
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:02,840
I should start doing that.

403
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:06,480
- We should fix the San Francisco situation.

404
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:09,120
What's going on with all the damn crime up there?

405
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:12,500
- Oh yeah, I saw the Mark Rober video

406
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:15,280
where he puts, where he puts his,

407
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:16,120
have you seen those videos

408
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:17,720
where he makes a little prank box?

409
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:20,480
- Yeah, I think it's funny how he keeps trying

410
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:23,680
to make it seem like it's like a thing for charity

411
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:24,900
or like he's doing good in the world,

412
00:15:24,900 --> 00:15:27,360
but it's just like a proto jail

413
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:29,240
to destroy like every single poor person

414
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:30,960
in the world thing.

415
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:34,040
- Yeah, poor people, their lives aren't hard enough.

416
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:35,140
Let's cover them in glitter

417
00:15:35,140 --> 00:15:36,540
and make them smell like farts.

418
00:15:36,540 --> 00:15:37,620
(laughing)

419
00:15:37,620 --> 00:15:39,860
This is good, Mark Grover.

420
00:15:39,860 --> 00:15:41,620
Yeah, that's the funny thing about those.

421
00:15:41,620 --> 00:15:44,540
- Every comment's like, "Yeah, that kid thought

422
00:15:44,540 --> 00:15:46,580
"he was gonna get a PS5 for free.

423
00:15:46,580 --> 00:15:50,100
"Fuck you, kid, you fucking, you're a criminal."

424
00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:53,420
- Every comment is, "Justice has officially been served."

425
00:15:53,420 --> 00:15:56,420
And then you watch the video and it's four kids

426
00:15:56,420 --> 00:15:59,100
in a storage unit that they live in,

427
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:02,100
and none of them can't speak any English,

428
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:03,820
they have no eyes, they don't even know

429
00:16:03,820 --> 00:16:05,460
what's happening to them.

430
00:16:05,460 --> 00:16:07,100
They open the thing, they're just kidding.

431
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:09,660
They honestly, some of them, I've seen this,

432
00:16:09,660 --> 00:16:10,740
I've watched all the videos,

433
00:16:10,740 --> 00:16:13,820
some of them literally think that that's what a PS5 does

434
00:16:13,820 --> 00:16:15,700
'cause they don't know any better.

435
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:18,820
They open the box, it sprays fart spray in their mouths.

436
00:16:18,820 --> 00:16:20,460
- Yeah, they just-- - It calls the cops.

437
00:16:20,460 --> 00:16:23,620
- Sit there and look at it for like half a minute

438
00:16:23,620 --> 00:16:25,180
and they're like, "Let's just throw this out.

439
00:16:25,180 --> 00:16:26,620
"I don't think this is what it's supposed to be doing."

440
00:16:26,620 --> 00:16:29,260
- I think I don't like PlayStations.

441
00:16:29,260 --> 00:16:31,740
I think I'm an Xbox kind of kid.

442
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:33,740
- Yeah, he should just make one,

443
00:16:33,740 --> 00:16:38,740
he should just start making those machines explode.

444
00:16:38,740 --> 00:16:41,380
- He also, if he really wants to catch villains,

445
00:16:41,380 --> 00:16:45,020
he needs to make it appeal more to a villain.

446
00:16:45,020 --> 00:16:48,620
What does a villain want to do with a PlayStation?

447
00:16:48,620 --> 00:16:50,180
You know, he's busy plotting.

448
00:16:50,180 --> 00:16:51,300
He should make it-- - He wants to shoot

449
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:52,380
in online video games.

450
00:16:52,380 --> 00:16:55,220
- He should tie up one of them on,

451
00:16:55,220 --> 00:16:56,460
well no, that doesn't make any sense.

452
00:16:56,460 --> 00:16:57,900
- He wants to use a bot.

453
00:16:57,900 --> 00:17:02,900
he should put one near a train track

454
00:17:02,900 --> 00:17:04,060
and make it look like,

455
00:17:04,060 --> 00:17:06,440
do a ballistics dummy that looks like a woman,

456
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:08,620
or just use a real woman, I don't care.

457
00:17:08,620 --> 00:17:09,880
And then put it,

458
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:12,800
and then maybe a big bundle of rope right next to her.

459
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:13,640
- Yeah.

460
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:17,000
- And say villains, villains of San Francisco have at it.

461
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,400
- Well, one of them, one year was,

462
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:20,500
I thought it was really funny

463
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:23,820
because it was like the Oculus VR headset box.

464
00:17:23,820 --> 00:17:24,660
- Yeah.

465
00:17:24,660 --> 00:17:26,720
- And I was like, no one knows what this is.

466
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:27,660
(laughs)

467
00:17:27,660 --> 00:17:31,580
Like just go back to like putting like headphone boxes or like an iPhone box.

468
00:17:31,580 --> 00:17:34,580
Yeah. That was the video,

469
00:17:34,580 --> 00:17:38,540
the most recent one where people are just like cracking the windows on the,

470
00:17:38,540 --> 00:17:42,580
the like the cars. Yeah. It's pretty cool, man.

471
00:17:42,580 --> 00:17:44,060
It kind of seems like a cool job.

472
00:17:44,060 --> 00:17:46,940
Yeah. Window breaker into?

473
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:49,660
Yeah. Window break.

474
00:17:49,660 --> 00:17:54,060
Well, they got it down to a science. It's so, it's so, they do it so quick.

475
00:17:54,100 --> 00:17:57,940
They break into the back window and they open up your back seat

476
00:17:57,940 --> 00:18:00,140
to see if you've got anything in the trunk.

477
00:18:00,140 --> 00:18:03,900
And then if they don't see anything, they just leave.

478
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:04,900
- Yeah, they say it a lot.

479
00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:06,820
- Have you guys ever been thieved from?

480
00:18:06,820 --> 00:18:09,040
- Yes.

481
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:11,620
- Have I talked about the time my house got broken into

482
00:18:11,620 --> 00:18:13,540
and none of my stuff got stolen?

483
00:18:13,540 --> 00:18:15,740
- I don't think you've talked about this on the podcast.

484
00:18:15,740 --> 00:18:16,860
I know you've told me before.

485
00:18:16,860 --> 00:18:17,780
What happened?

486
00:18:17,780 --> 00:18:22,780
- So, where I lived, there was a group of,

487
00:18:23,740 --> 00:18:26,340
Let's call it low-income housing, like in the alley behind us.

488
00:18:26,340 --> 00:18:28,340
Yeah, let's call it low-income housing.

489
00:18:28,340 --> 00:18:30,840
I mean, that's what it was. It was like section 8 stuff.

490
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:32,840
You wanted to call it the ghetto.

491
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:35,640
It was not. But it just happened to be where it was.

492
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:37,640
The hood!

493
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:41,840
Anyway, the way our house was set up was there was like a porch

494
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:44,640
to like go out and smoke cigarettes on.

495
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:46,640
And there was a sliding glass.

496
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:47,640
Is that what it was for?

497
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:48,640
That's what they built it!

498
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:50,640
That's what they built it?

499
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:52,640
[laughter]

500
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:54,960
So you had a smoking section in the house.

501
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:56,640
Yeah, big sliding glass door.

502
00:18:56,640 --> 00:19:00,760
So you could see in and then there was like my one roommate and I both had like

503
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:03,880
desktop computers, like gaming computer setups and shit.

504
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:07,760
And, um, you know, I have my three monitors and shit.

505
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:10,800
He had his set up across from mine.

506
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:16,440
And then like in the room just next to it, there is like a TV and like a PS4

507
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:19,200
and Beats headphones and a laptop.

508
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:24,560
and they like broken through the sliding glass door.

509
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:30,060
They ripped this like blanket that I was using like off of my

510
00:19:30,060 --> 00:19:33,560
desk took a look at myself and was like not for me.

511
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:37,260
Thanks tried to steal by other roommates desktop.

512
00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:39,260
It got caught on the wires.

513
00:19:39,260 --> 00:19:43,260
They just dropped it and it like shattered on my girl and

514
00:19:43,260 --> 00:19:47,960
then they stole my other roommate his TV his ps4 his beats

515
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:49,960
headphones both of the laptops.

516
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:51,960
It's just like all this stuff.

517
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:54,960
It just did me, just like looked at mine and was like,

518
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:57,960
"Yeah, I'm good on that." And then, just like...

519
00:19:57,960 --> 00:20:00,960
Yeah, I mean honestly you wish they stole it. That is so insulting.

520
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:03,960
I was honestly, I was so happy. I was like,

521
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:06,960
"Oh my God, I'm so sorry this happened to you."

522
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:09,960
This is so horrible. You're playing cookie clicker

523
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:11,960
on all three monitors as you talk to it.

524
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:13,960
Just nothing happened to my stuff.

525
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:16,960
Completely just untouched. They looked at it and said,

526
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:18,160
No thank you.

527
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:19,720
- Did your room perhaps look like

528
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:22,200
the way your current room looks like?

529
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:24,680
- No, 'cause they came in through an office,

530
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:28,280
and so it was just like a desk with computer equipment on it.

531
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:29,120
- Right, no. - And they thought

532
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:30,920
my computer was worse than my roommate's,

533
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:32,540
so they tried to steal his.

534
00:20:32,540 --> 00:20:33,380
- Okay.

535
00:20:33,380 --> 00:20:34,660
- Did his have more lights?

536
00:20:34,660 --> 00:20:35,500
- Yes.

537
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:36,600
- Mm. (laughs)

538
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:40,400
That's why you don't put RGB in your fucking computer, man.

539
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:42,960
- Yeah, I had just a shitty case that looked bad.

540
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:44,920
- You want it to look very humble.

541
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:45,880
- Yeah.

542
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:48,720
Put it in like an old, some old HP case.

543
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:49,560
That's the move, honestly.

544
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:51,200
- It was a sleeper build?

545
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:52,740
- It was a sleeper build.

546
00:20:52,740 --> 00:20:53,580
I mean, it was just--

547
00:20:53,580 --> 00:20:54,740
- Sleepy build?

548
00:20:54,740 --> 00:20:56,240
- It just looked like shit.

549
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:58,080
'Cause it was the first computer I built.

550
00:20:58,080 --> 00:20:59,940
But like, it was very funny.

551
00:20:59,940 --> 00:21:02,560
And just having to pretend to be like sad about it,

552
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:04,600
like nothing, you know, nothing happened to me.

553
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:06,640
I'm not too beat up in any way.

554
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:07,480
- Yeah.

555
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:08,840
- Uh, you know.

556
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:11,080
And then he's like, "Can we get my PS4?"

557
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:13,080
Like he's talking to the police and being like,

558
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:15,240
"Can we, you know, track my PS4?"

559
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:18,240
(laughing)

560
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:20,560
Meanwhile, I'm just still just playing video games.

561
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:24,400
And I remember that was during my Adderall snorting days

562
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:27,080
and the cop was like kind of taking like notes down

563
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:29,000
on everything that was like missing.

564
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,520
And like, I was sitting at my desk and didn't think about it

565
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:33,600
and there's just a rolled up $1 bill

566
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:36,480
dyed completely blue from all that Adderall.

567
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:37,720
(laughing)

568
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:40,200
Just like making eye contact with him about it

569
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:41,040
as he's staring at the record.

570
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:42,960
- It's not illegal to snort your own Adderall

571
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:44,480
that you have a prescription for?

572
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:46,900
- Exactly. - Yeah.

573
00:21:46,900 --> 00:21:48,080
You can do, it's your medicine,

574
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:49,620
you can do whatever you want with it.

575
00:21:49,620 --> 00:21:50,980
- Exactly.

576
00:21:50,980 --> 00:21:52,180
That's 100% true.

577
00:21:52,180 --> 00:21:53,540
- Fuck that cop.

578
00:21:53,540 --> 00:21:55,500
- So, it's very funny. - Yeah, fuck him.

579
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:58,020
Did he even find anything from your roommates?

580
00:21:58,020 --> 00:21:59,660
- Fuck no. - Stolen goods?

581
00:21:59,660 --> 00:22:02,060
- What do, cops never retrieve anything.

582
00:22:02,060 --> 00:22:03,620
- No, pretty much never.

583
00:22:03,620 --> 00:22:07,280
It's always, I mean, unless it's a car,

584
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:09,260
they don't really try at all either.

585
00:22:09,260 --> 00:22:10,580
- No, no.

586
00:22:10,580 --> 00:22:14,700
- We should switch to like a no cops situation,

587
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:17,300
but we have like a Batman in every city.

588
00:22:17,300 --> 00:22:20,380
- I've been saying this.

589
00:22:20,380 --> 00:22:23,140
- I think that would solve every single crime in the world.

590
00:22:23,140 --> 00:22:26,660
- I think that's why Rex wants to move to New York City, man.

591
00:22:26,660 --> 00:22:28,540
- Yeah, to be Batman.

592
00:22:28,540 --> 00:22:29,860
- Do you think I could be Batman?

593
00:22:29,860 --> 00:22:32,740
I think you could be Batman for a couple of reasons.

594
00:22:32,740 --> 00:22:35,380
- I think I could beat up like a poor person.

595
00:22:35,380 --> 00:22:36,220
- Yeah.

596
00:22:36,220 --> 00:22:37,960
- And get into like a internecine fight

597
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:40,460
with like some guy who likes to tell riddles.

598
00:22:40,460 --> 00:22:43,080
- Yeah, that is the kind of folks

599
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:45,160
that you tend to attract, I would say.

600
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:50,100
- Yeah, yeah, I think I could get into a long fight

601
00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:52,720
that destroys the city, accomplishes nothing

602
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:55,440
with a guy who dresses up in spandex.

603
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:57,880
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, what's with all this heat for Batman?

604
00:22:57,880 --> 00:22:59,000
You need to chill.

605
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:02,360
- Sorry. - Pointless fight.

606
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:04,480
He's trying to protect the city, you motherfucker.

607
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:06,080
What are you doing for Gotham?

608
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:08,120
- Yeah, but they destroy it in the end.

609
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:09,880
- Every superhero destroys every city.

610
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:11,400
Have you seen Man of Steel?

611
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:14,240
Literally 50 million people die in that movie

612
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:18,060
because Superman is punching Zob or Zod or Zog,

613
00:23:18,060 --> 00:23:19,400
whatever his name is, through--

614
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:20,960
- Zog, he's punching the Zog.

615
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:22,040
(laughing)

616
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:23,480
- Superman versus Zog.

617
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:26,600
He's punching him through the Empire State Building.

618
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:29,440
- See, blonde hair, blue eyes Superman is really crazy.

619
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:31,680
(laughing)

620
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:35,960
- My dad got thieved from when I was a kid.

621
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:37,680
Somebody, he used to have these ferns,

622
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:39,200
they were the only things he loved in his life.

623
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:42,120
He had two ferns that sat out on his front porch.

624
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:44,360
- Would you sit between them?

625
00:23:44,360 --> 00:23:45,600
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

626
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:47,200
That was...

627
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:49,160
- What is that, is that even a joke?

628
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:51,760
Would you sit between, yes, okay.

629
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:52,880
Actually we would.

630
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:54,120
It was on the porch between,

631
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:56,000
it was literally the setup of the show.

632
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:59,720
It was a fern on either side.

633
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:02,680
Scott Aukerman must have walked by my dad's porch one day

634
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:04,240
and been like, this is the show.

635
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:06,600
- Was this a smoking porch or no smoking porch?

636
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:08,640
- My dad would smoke cigars out there.

637
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:11,640
So there was two rocking chairs,

638
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:14,960
a little table and a fern on either end of the porch.

639
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:16,640
- Yeah, they have a mama over there.

640
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:19,880
- Yeah, and my dad cared about these ferns so much.

641
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:22,040
He would take them inside when it was cold.

642
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:25,720
All he cared about were these ferns.

643
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:29,560
And one day somebody stole them and I've never seen him.

644
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:32,080
His voice went up two octaves and he was like,

645
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:34,680
"I just don't understand why you would take a fern.

646
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:35,840
"It doesn't make sense.

647
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:40,400
"And then he said, the funniest thing to me was he was like,

648
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:42,860
"and the thing is now they have to take care of them."

649
00:24:42,860 --> 00:24:45,100
(laughing)

650
00:24:45,100 --> 00:24:47,800
- He's right though.

651
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:49,880
- He's worried about the ferns.

652
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:51,160
- It's like stealing a dog.

653
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:53,480
It's like now you just have a responsibility.

654
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:55,880
- Yeah, now you have to take care of the ferns.

655
00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:59,840
- I think that actually happened to my dad.

656
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:04,560
I remember one day, they used to have these donation boxes

657
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:07,440
outside of this Burger King we would go to,

658
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:10,680
where you could put clothing or whatever to donate.

659
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:13,800
And sitting right beside it, clearly meant for donation,

660
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:18,800
were these two porcelain dragons,

661
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:21,200
like Chinese dragons with tassels.

662
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:22,280
- Whoa.

663
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:26,120
- He whipped the car around, parked.

664
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:27,800
- Like father, like son, man.

665
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:31,400
Yeah, and just brought them into his home for years.

666
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:38,200
Uh, and he fucking dude, he was fucking, he loved those.

667
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:42,440
And then I think someone like broken and they like broke.

668
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:45,840
Oh, it was like, yeah.

669
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:48,000
And he was devastated.

670
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,760
Wow.

671
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:50,840
I've never seen the man.

672
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:51,360
So sad.

673
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:56,280
These criminals, man, we need to put it into all crime in this.

674
00:25:56,280 --> 00:25:57,400
We need a Batman.

675
00:25:57,400 --> 00:26:02,280
Batman barely stops any crime though, you know,

676
00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:03,120
to be honest.

677
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:06,160
It's funny how one of the things on the new movie

678
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:09,120
you're like, yeah, the criminals are just scared of the night

679
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:11,860
because maybe I'm there, maybe I'm not.

680
00:26:11,860 --> 00:26:12,700
And then they're like showing like--

681
00:26:12,700 --> 00:26:14,400
There's one guy in a city of eight million people

682
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:17,000
who's running around, only at night by the way.

683
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,760
They're showing like four crimes happening at the same time

684
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:21,560
and he's not in a single one of them.

685
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:22,400
Yeah.

686
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:23,440
He's like on the train.

687
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:25,820
Motherfucker.

688
00:26:25,820 --> 00:26:27,100
That's the thing, we need,

689
00:26:27,100 --> 00:26:30,460
If you want to do a Batman thing, you really need 100 Batmans,

690
00:26:30,460 --> 00:26:31,900
or 1,000 Batmans.

691
00:26:31,900 --> 00:26:34,500
And maybe they should be wearing blue outfits and have guns.

692
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:36,820
[LAUGHTER]

693
00:26:36,820 --> 00:26:39,500
And tasers, and they should be really fat.

694
00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:41,180
They should not really do all that much.

695
00:26:41,180 --> 00:26:44,180
They should be very, very-- just the minimum amount of training,

696
00:26:44,180 --> 00:26:46,060
and just let them loose and see what happens.

697
00:26:46,060 --> 00:26:46,700
That's my idea.

698
00:26:46,700 --> 00:26:49,060
They should make sure they couldn't graduate from college.

699
00:26:49,060 --> 00:26:49,780
Yeah, exactly.

700
00:26:49,780 --> 00:26:50,820
They had to go to a college where

701
00:26:50,820 --> 00:26:51,980
you shoot a gun in the air.

702
00:26:51,980 --> 00:26:54,140
That's most of their assignment.

703
00:26:54,140 --> 00:26:55,740
Yeah.

704
00:26:55,740 --> 00:26:57,500
- When were you stolen from, Julio?

705
00:26:57,500 --> 00:27:01,580
- I got mugged when I was a kid once.

706
00:27:01,580 --> 00:27:03,180
- You were a kid?

707
00:27:03,180 --> 00:27:04,820
- What kind of sick fucker--

708
00:27:04,820 --> 00:27:07,180
- Was it another kid that mugged you?

709
00:27:07,180 --> 00:27:08,700
- Who mugs a child?

710
00:27:08,700 --> 00:27:09,900
- I don't know.

711
00:27:09,900 --> 00:27:12,700
Some 17 year old, I don't know,

712
00:27:12,700 --> 00:27:14,060
was in the street at night.

713
00:27:14,060 --> 00:27:16,060
- How old were you?

714
00:27:16,060 --> 00:27:18,260
- I don't remember.

715
00:27:18,260 --> 00:27:20,980
I think I was like 15, 16 maybe.

716
00:27:20,980 --> 00:27:22,680
- Did they take, what'd they take?

717
00:27:23,780 --> 00:27:26,280
I think they took a bracelet that I had

718
00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:28,160
and I didn't have anything else.

719
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:30,140
Maybe like a cell phone.

720
00:27:30,140 --> 00:27:33,760
- I feel like this, it's, wait, sorry, what else?

721
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:36,360
- Well, we were walking back from the store,

722
00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:37,920
it was me and my cousin.

723
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:39,200
We're walking back from the store

724
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:43,640
because we bought some sodas to drink to eat dinner.

725
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:45,000
- Don't tell me he took the soda.

726
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,160
- He took, he literally took one of the sodas.

727
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:49,160
- No, God. - One of them?

728
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:50,200
- Whose was it?

729
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:52,120
Yours or your friend's? - It's degenerate.

730
00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:53,360
- I think mine.

731
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:55,040
- Oh no!

732
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:58,080
No! - I'm so sorry.

733
00:27:58,080 --> 00:27:59,600
I'm so sorry. - Yeah.

734
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:02,200
It was long ago, I don't really care about it anymore.

735
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:03,040
- I feel like getting a weapon--

736
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:05,280
- Did he have a weapon? - Is not a big deal anymore.

737
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:07,080
- What's up? - Did he have a weapon?

738
00:28:07,080 --> 00:28:10,160
- No, it was three guys.

739
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:13,760
It was like a gang of criminals.

740
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:15,440
- Oh God, MS-13.

741
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:17,200
I hate that for you.

742
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:18,560
I hate that for you.

743
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:20,600
You know, this is funny, I always hear,

744
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:23,000
it's always the most giant people I know

745
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,700
who have been mugged?

746
00:28:24,700 --> 00:28:25,720
- I was a kid.

747
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:28,900
- But you were probably the same height as you are now.

748
00:28:28,900 --> 00:28:31,300
- I was completely not.

749
00:28:31,300 --> 00:28:32,860
- When you were 17 or 16,

750
00:28:32,860 --> 00:28:34,900
you weren't the same height as you are now?

751
00:28:34,900 --> 00:28:36,940
- I don't remember.

752
00:28:36,940 --> 00:28:38,740
- This guy has the worst memory, I can't remember.

753
00:28:38,740 --> 00:28:40,860
He's acting like he was four years old.

754
00:28:40,860 --> 00:28:43,580
- I do actually have really bad memory.

755
00:28:43,580 --> 00:28:45,220
- I know, I work with you.

756
00:28:45,220 --> 00:28:46,420
Yeah, so.

757
00:28:46,420 --> 00:28:48,020
But yeah, a buddy of mine was mugged

758
00:28:48,020 --> 00:28:49,660
and he's like six foot seven.

759
00:28:49,660 --> 00:28:52,620
And he was just mugged by a lone guy.

760
00:28:52,620 --> 00:28:55,060
And I just can't imagine why you would pick...

761
00:28:55,060 --> 00:28:56,300
Pick a girl! What are you doing?

762
00:28:56,300 --> 00:28:57,300
Right.

763
00:28:57,300 --> 00:29:00,360
Here's the thing, right?

764
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:02,420
No one carries cash anymore.

765
00:29:02,420 --> 00:29:03,420
Yeah.

766
00:29:03,420 --> 00:29:04,540
So mugging is like...

767
00:29:04,540 --> 00:29:05,540
And cell phones are...

768
00:29:05,540 --> 00:29:08,180
It's so hard to steal a cell phone and have it be worth anything.

769
00:29:08,180 --> 00:29:10,980
Right, because iPhones, they just get iCloud locked.

770
00:29:10,980 --> 00:29:11,620
Yeah.

771
00:29:11,620 --> 00:29:14,700
And it costs like $300 to get the tools to...

772
00:29:14,700 --> 00:29:16,380
You literally have to kill somebody

773
00:29:16,380 --> 00:29:20,220
and then take over their identity to steal a phone.

774
00:29:20,220 --> 00:29:21,540
Yeah. I did... No, hold on.

775
00:29:21,540 --> 00:29:24,380
I did look this up because I was thinking about it.

776
00:29:24,380 --> 00:29:25,940
I wanted to-- - About doing it?

777
00:29:25,940 --> 00:29:28,580
- Well, just converting all the ones

778
00:29:28,580 --> 00:29:31,020
that are clearly stolen on eBay

779
00:29:31,020 --> 00:29:32,780
into something that's sellable.

780
00:29:32,780 --> 00:29:35,780
And it costs like $300 for the tool to do it.

781
00:29:35,780 --> 00:29:37,740
And you have to know how to like solder.

782
00:29:37,740 --> 00:29:40,100
And it's like, that's not worth it

783
00:29:40,100 --> 00:29:43,640
to someone who's willing to rob someone for an iPhone.

784
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:45,380
- Yeah, I honestly don't know

785
00:29:45,380 --> 00:29:46,820
what people get robbed for anymore.

786
00:29:46,820 --> 00:29:48,380
Like they'll take, I mean,

787
00:29:48,380 --> 00:29:50,580
even if they take a credit card or a debit card,

788
00:29:50,580 --> 00:29:52,260
You can lock it. - Right, I'm just gonna call.

789
00:29:52,260 --> 00:29:53,860
- Yeah, exactly, and they need your phone.

790
00:29:53,860 --> 00:29:57,060
The only thing I've heard is if you're at an ATM,

791
00:29:57,060 --> 00:29:58,860
they'll make you take the money out.

792
00:29:58,860 --> 00:30:02,760
And that scares me so, so badly.

793
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:04,660
- But there's cameras on the ATM.

794
00:30:04,660 --> 00:30:07,540
- Because I have an embarrassing pin code.

795
00:30:07,540 --> 00:30:08,620
- What is it? - What is your pin code?

796
00:30:08,620 --> 00:30:10,340
- 1111.

797
00:30:10,340 --> 00:30:11,700
- That is embarrassing.

798
00:30:11,700 --> 00:30:13,660
- It's 11, yeah, it's 1111.

799
00:30:13,660 --> 00:30:15,260
So fuck me, right?

800
00:30:15,260 --> 00:30:17,060
- Yeah, mine's 6969.

801
00:30:17,060 --> 00:30:18,820
- It's my mom's birthday, okay?

802
00:30:18,820 --> 00:30:19,660
- Yep.

803
00:30:19,660 --> 00:30:21,220
- She was born-- - One, one, one, one.

804
00:30:21,220 --> 00:30:22,880
- Yep, 11, 11. - The first of January

805
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:25,680
in 2011. - 2011, yes, yes.

806
00:30:25,680 --> 00:30:26,520
How'd you know?

807
00:30:26,520 --> 00:30:27,620
(laughing)

808
00:30:27,620 --> 00:30:29,620
- Ah, she's quite young.

809
00:30:29,620 --> 00:30:31,500
- She's a spring chicken.

810
00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:33,300
- Yep. (burps)

811
00:30:33,300 --> 00:30:35,020
- Oh my God, he's almost done with his Bud Light.

812
00:30:35,020 --> 00:30:35,860
- Guys. (coughs)

813
00:30:35,860 --> 00:30:38,580
- That was not a, how big, how many ounces are in that can?

814
00:30:38,580 --> 00:30:39,980
- Yeah, this is--

815
00:30:39,980 --> 00:30:42,100
- That does not look the same size as this can.

816
00:30:42,100 --> 00:30:44,060
- I have a-- - They're all the same size.

817
00:30:44,060 --> 00:30:44,900
- No, yours is definitely smaller.

818
00:30:44,900 --> 00:30:47,220
- How many ounces is your can? - You have a medium boy.

819
00:30:47,220 --> 00:30:48,700
- You're a small, you're a small--

820
00:30:48,700 --> 00:30:50,040
How many ounces is your can?

821
00:30:50,040 --> 00:30:51,040
Say it right now.

822
00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:54,140
It says in milliliters, it doesn't say ounces.

823
00:30:54,140 --> 00:30:55,700
Okay, so what is it?

824
00:30:55,700 --> 00:30:56,700
It's 473 milliliters.

825
00:30:56,700 --> 00:30:59,560
Oh, that's definitely not as big as this one.

826
00:30:59,560 --> 00:31:00,560
This one's got to be 750.

827
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:01,560
Yeah, this is 740.

828
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:02,560
I'll check.

829
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:03,560
I'll check how much it is.

830
00:31:03,560 --> 00:31:04,560
Yeah, that's a 16 ounce can.

831
00:31:04,560 --> 00:31:05,560
This is a 24 ounce can.

832
00:31:05,560 --> 00:31:06,560
You are a baby.

833
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:07,560
You're not rolling with the big dogs today.

834
00:31:07,560 --> 00:31:08,560
Yeah, this is 16 ounces.

835
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:09,560
Yeah, these are 24, dude.

836
00:31:09,560 --> 00:31:10,560
No wonder you're dumb.

837
00:31:10,560 --> 00:31:11,560
Wait.

838
00:31:11,560 --> 00:31:12,560
Whoa!

839
00:31:12,560 --> 00:31:13,560
Oh!

840
00:31:13,560 --> 00:31:14,560
Oh, my God.

841
00:31:14,560 --> 00:31:15,560
Oh, my God.

842
00:31:15,560 --> 00:31:16,560
Oh, my God.

843
00:31:16,560 --> 00:31:17,560
Oh, my God.

844
00:31:17,560 --> 00:31:18,560
Oh, my God.

845
00:31:18,560 --> 00:31:22,560
He has three more. You're an alcoholic and you have a problem.

846
00:31:22,560 --> 00:31:25,560
You think so? Yes!

847
00:31:25,560 --> 00:31:27,560
Open one of those bad boys right now. Don't say that.

848
00:31:27,560 --> 00:31:30,560
Open it. No, come on. Don't make me drink another beer.

849
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:33,560
Drink that beer you motherfucker.

850
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:35,560
Oh shit.

851
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:36,560
What?

852
00:31:36,560 --> 00:31:38,560
Did it pop on you?

853
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:41,560
Wait, that's not fair anymore. Now I'm going to drink 32 ounces.

854
00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:42,560
You're bigger than us.

855
00:31:42,560 --> 00:31:43,560
24 ounces.

856
00:31:43,560 --> 00:31:47,560
You're bigger than us. We're 5 foot 9. You're 6 foot 7.

857
00:31:47,560 --> 00:31:49,560
Yeah, but I gotta drive home after this

858
00:31:49,560 --> 00:31:58,080
Don't worry I have another beer after this as well

859
00:31:58,080 --> 00:32:02,140
Whoa, okay. What was the first time you guys ever drunk-drived?

860
00:32:02,140 --> 00:32:07,560
I don't really think I've ever drunk drove really

861
00:32:07,560 --> 00:32:10,800
High drove plenty of time. Never mind me neither

862
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:16,840
Yeah, I've never been like to like I mean like drinks or whatever the drunkest ever been

863
00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:20,240
And it was with you guys when you guys tried to poison me at that bar.

864
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:22,240
Oh yeah, I remember that.

865
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:29,960
But I distinctly remember once I went to my buddy's house because it was his birthday

866
00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:32,640
and it was like on a Monday night.

867
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:36,200
So it was kind of an awkward day to be like drinking, but I was drinking anyways.

868
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:40,000
I was like, "Alright, well I got to go home now."

869
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:45,280
So I was drinking and then I drove home and then I showed up to work the next day.

870
00:32:45,280 --> 00:32:46,280
but I wasn't always drunk.

871
00:32:46,280 --> 00:32:49,880
We were drinking probably like some gay light beer.

872
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:53,960
The first time I was always very careful about drug driving when I was like

873
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:59,760
really young because I just was like cops in Wilmington.

874
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:03,200
There's like a checkpoint every single night going anywhere.

875
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:06,520
And every night. Yeah, pretty much. Yeah.

876
00:33:06,520 --> 00:33:10,520
And if you're especially when I lived on the I lived on Pleasure Island,

877
00:33:10,520 --> 00:33:12,600
this was the name of the island I lived on.

878
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:14,600
There's a bridge there that would always have a check.

879
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:15,880
Pleasure Island.

880
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:17,760
I live in the sexual island.

881
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:19,160
Locals only, man.

882
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:21,160
It wasn't.

883
00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:24,160
It was locals only, especially in the winter.

884
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:26,480
But they always had a checkpoint there.

885
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:29,280
So, and if you're underage, man,

886
00:33:29,280 --> 00:33:31,000
this is the most fucked up law in the world.

887
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:34,560
If you're underage, if you blow anything over a zero zero,

888
00:33:34,560 --> 00:33:35,880
you get a DUI.

889
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:37,320
If you're under 21.

890
00:33:37,320 --> 00:33:38,320
That is fucked up.

891
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:40,560
Isn't that one of the most awful things ever?

892
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:55,900
I do remember sorry but to cut you up but that was remind me one time I was drinking in the park with someone and I they spilled beer on my lap and then this was like after work so it was like midnight.

893
00:33:55,900 --> 00:34:04,340
We go back to my car or i go to like drop them off and there's a cop like parked behind their car.

894
00:34:05,080 --> 00:34:07,780
So they get out and the cop, I'm like, "Hey,"

895
00:34:07,780 --> 00:34:11,180
you know, we're like talking to the cop to get him to move out of the way of the car.

896
00:34:11,180 --> 00:34:16,180
And the cop is like, "You smell like beer."

897
00:34:16,180 --> 00:34:17,680
And I was like, "No, I don't."

898
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:19,880
That's my smell!

899
00:34:19,880 --> 00:34:22,380
That's just my natural smell.

900
00:34:22,380 --> 00:34:26,380
And I was just like shooting the shit with him, he's this Asian dude, and I...

901
00:34:26,380 --> 00:34:28,980
That's gonna come in later, folks.

902
00:34:28,980 --> 00:34:32,480
He's like, "You don't seem very afraid of me."

903
00:34:32,880 --> 00:34:37,880
And I was like, "Buddy, why does they come?"

904
00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:39,180
I got no fear.

905
00:34:39,180 --> 00:34:41,880
You said, "I'm white" to an Asian cop?

906
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:43,880
Yes, dude.

907
00:34:43,880 --> 00:34:44,880
That's crazy.

908
00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:46,880
I was a little drunk.

909
00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:47,880
Oh my god.

910
00:34:47,880 --> 00:34:50,880
That's the only time I can think of that I have drunk drugs.

911
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:51,880
Didn't he kill you?

912
00:34:51,880 --> 00:34:53,880
Why didn't you just say, "Yeah, he spilled beer on me"?

913
00:34:53,880 --> 00:34:55,880
Because I'm 17.

914
00:34:55,880 --> 00:34:56,880
Oh god.

915
00:34:56,880 --> 00:34:59,880
Well, you could have said, "I'm using this new deodorant.

916
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:03,880
It's a prank deodorant, but it's the only deodorant I can afford. I'm very poor.

917
00:35:03,880 --> 00:35:05,880
It's my prank beer deodorant.

918
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:07,880
It's a prank beer deodorant. It's literally just for...

919
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:09,880
They bought it for moments like this.

920
00:35:09,880 --> 00:35:11,880
When I talk to cops.

921
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:13,880
Yeah.

922
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:15,880
That's a good idea. A beer deodorant.

923
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:17,880
Wait, that's a wrap.

924
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:19,880
Well, not a wrap, but that's an invention.

925
00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:21,880
Have you anything to drink tonight? Have I?

926
00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:23,880
And then it's the beer drink.

927
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:25,880
You tell me.

928
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:27,880
No, it's worse than the deodorant.

929
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:28,720
- He's like, "Do you have deodorant?"

930
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:29,760
He's like, "Applying it."

931
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:31,520
(laughing)

932
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:33,560
- Smell my armpit, smell it.

933
00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:34,400
You have to be really close.

934
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:38,200
- No, you smell like alcohol, you just spray him with it.

935
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:41,520
- That is actually an amazing idea.

936
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:43,620
That is an amazing fucking idea.

937
00:35:43,620 --> 00:35:47,720
A pepper spray that smells like beer,

938
00:35:47,720 --> 00:35:49,560
that doesn't hurt them.

939
00:35:49,560 --> 00:35:50,560
It's like a skunk.

940
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:51,920
- And it's invisible.

941
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:54,520
- Yeah, it's like a skunk spray.

942
00:35:54,520 --> 00:35:56,840
So like if you're in an argument with your girlfriend

943
00:35:56,840 --> 00:35:57,800
She's like, I'm leaving.

944
00:35:57,800 --> 00:35:58,880
You just spray her.

945
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:01,720
[LAUGHTER]

946
00:36:01,720 --> 00:36:04,080
Spray her with a beer spray.

947
00:36:04,080 --> 00:36:05,080
Fucking bitch.

948
00:36:05,080 --> 00:36:06,280
Go ahead.

949
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:07,640
I know you're going to speed home.

950
00:36:07,640 --> 00:36:08,960
I see what kind of man wants you fucking now, bitch.

951
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:09,480
Yeah, exactly.

952
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:10,780
You smell like beer, you bitch.

953
00:36:10,780 --> 00:36:12,760
Get out of my house.

954
00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:13,280
You're drunk.

955
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:14,200
Yeah, you're drunk.

956
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:14,720
Go home.

957
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:15,720
Oh, you're drunk.

958
00:36:15,720 --> 00:36:17,320
Yeah, FaceTiming somebody.

959
00:36:17,320 --> 00:36:18,040
She's drunk.

960
00:36:18,040 --> 00:36:20,320
I can smell it on her.

961
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:22,200
Walking up to your roommate, she's fucked up.

962
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:23,520
You can smell it on her, bro.

963
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:25,480
She smells like fucking beer.

964
00:36:25,480 --> 00:36:26,600
She doesn't mean it.

965
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:29,600
But it's still pepper spray, so she's on the floor.

966
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:32,200
She's so drunk she's crying and she has a red face.

967
00:36:32,200 --> 00:36:36,500
No, that's wrong guys.

968
00:36:36,500 --> 00:36:37,500
We can't do that.

969
00:36:37,500 --> 00:36:39,000
Why?

970
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,300
That's a bad app.

971
00:36:41,300 --> 00:36:43,900
I watched last night.

972
00:36:43,900 --> 00:36:46,700
I watched the social network.

973
00:36:46,700 --> 00:36:50,500
Is that where you got your app idea from earlier?

974
00:36:50,500 --> 00:36:52,500
I didn't realize until right now, but yeah.

975
00:36:52,500 --> 00:36:55,800
It was subconscious.

976
00:36:56,400 --> 00:37:00,400
I got it on the intake.

977
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:05,080
- People forget Facebook was for Harvard students only.

978
00:37:05,080 --> 00:37:09,440
- I will never forget, 'cause that movie is a 10 out of 10.

979
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:12,140
- You think so?

980
00:37:12,140 --> 00:37:14,120
- That's like a six foot seven movie.

981
00:37:14,120 --> 00:37:17,880
- That movie is pushing seven feet for me.

982
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:20,360
I love that movie, man.

983
00:37:20,360 --> 00:37:22,320
That score, oh.

984
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:23,160
- Trent Reznor.

985
00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:24,720
- You know what, Trent?

986
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:27,320
- I revisited it recently that I thought was,

987
00:37:27,320 --> 00:37:29,360
I forgot that I really liked.

988
00:37:29,360 --> 00:37:31,200
It's Men in Black.

989
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:32,360
- Men in Black?

990
00:37:32,360 --> 00:37:34,000
That's a six foot nine.

991
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,680
- It is so good.

992
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:36,520
- That's an amazing movie.

993
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:38,920
- And it's so funny.

994
00:37:38,920 --> 00:37:41,200
- Why did they not do a spin-off movie

995
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:43,080
about the cockroach guy?

996
00:37:43,080 --> 00:37:43,900
- I agree.

997
00:37:43,900 --> 00:37:46,320
- That is the funniest character of all time.

998
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:48,240
- And they should have done a spin-off movie

999
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:50,760
about the guy in the wheelchair from Wild Wild West.

1000
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:54,120
- Yes, and also, if they do redo the,

1001
00:37:54,120 --> 00:37:56,780
if they make a reboot with the cockroach guy,

1002
00:37:56,780 --> 00:37:58,540
it should be Will Sasso.

1003
00:37:58,540 --> 00:38:00,320
- Yes. - That's my thoughts.

1004
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:02,180
- He loved Will Sasso. - I think he would,

1005
00:38:02,180 --> 00:38:04,580
I think he would, I love Will Sasso.

1006
00:38:04,580 --> 00:38:05,420
Are you kidding me?

1007
00:38:05,420 --> 00:38:07,660
Those funny ass vines where he spits out a lemon?

1008
00:38:07,660 --> 00:38:08,820
(laughing)

1009
00:38:08,820 --> 00:38:10,340
That is the funniest shit ever.

1010
00:38:10,340 --> 00:38:13,020
- He ran Vine for one year.

1011
00:38:13,020 --> 00:38:16,180
- He was running that shit in a major way.

1012
00:38:16,180 --> 00:38:17,820
- Until he got took over by black people

1013
00:38:17,820 --> 00:38:18,940
doing racist jokes to themselves.

1014
00:38:18,940 --> 00:38:21,500
- He put water under the lemon.

1015
00:38:21,500 --> 00:38:23,780
People had spit out lemons for hundreds of years.

1016
00:38:23,780 --> 00:38:24,820
(laughing)

1017
00:38:24,820 --> 00:38:28,540
But nobody thought to put water behind the lemon.

1018
00:38:28,540 --> 00:38:30,740
(laughing)

1019
00:38:30,740 --> 00:38:32,180
This guy's a fucking genius.

1020
00:38:32,180 --> 00:38:35,220
- What does he do nowadays?

1021
00:38:35,220 --> 00:38:36,820
- Will Sasso, he does stand up.

1022
00:38:36,820 --> 00:38:37,660
He's always been a stand up.

1023
00:38:37,660 --> 00:38:39,940
- He does stand up comedy, his comedy podcast.

1024
00:38:39,940 --> 00:38:40,780
- Yeah, he does.

1025
00:38:40,780 --> 00:38:42,460
He's on Theo Vaughn's podcast and all that kind of shit.

1026
00:38:42,460 --> 00:38:46,940
- Do you think he's still spitting out lemons to this day?

1027
00:38:46,940 --> 00:38:47,780
- Probably.

1028
00:38:47,780 --> 00:38:49,900
- I would hope so.

1029
00:38:49,900 --> 00:38:50,740
- Yeah.

1030
00:38:50,740 --> 00:38:52,260
- I mean, yeah, I mean, I can't believe

1031
00:38:52,260 --> 00:38:55,340
hasn't made one of those videos in so long. He would dominate TikTok. These

1032
00:38:55,340 --> 00:39:00,060
kids don't remember, man. He needs to have his own podcast. Bobby Lee has a

1033
00:39:00,060 --> 00:39:05,700
podcast. He should have a podcast. I agree. Him with a lemon in his mouth.

1034
00:39:05,700 --> 00:39:16,060
Wait, no. It's an it's okay. So it's always one hour. Okay. It is always starts

1035
00:39:16,060 --> 00:39:20,140
with the lemon in his mouth. Yes. But the time where he spits it out is always

1036
00:39:20,140 --> 00:39:24,500
random so you know a lot of point he's gonna start talking normal again that's

1037
00:39:24,500 --> 00:39:32,800
the app yeah and that's also an app where you can send someone a picture or an idea

1038
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:37,260
you're watching the little sauce a podcast and then you know what happens

1039
00:39:37,260 --> 00:39:41,220
right after he spits the lemon out mm-hmm

1040
00:39:41,220 --> 00:39:47,780
he should just go until he can't have a lemon in his mouth anymore till he can't

1041
00:39:47,780 --> 00:39:49,380
stand it and then he spits it out.

1042
00:39:49,380 --> 00:39:52,140
And by the way, there is water behind that lemon.

1043
00:39:52,140 --> 00:39:52,980
- Yep.

1044
00:39:52,980 --> 00:39:54,620
- And oh, this is actually a great idea.

1045
00:39:54,620 --> 00:39:56,820
- And just like Squarespace is behind our podcast.

1046
00:39:56,820 --> 00:39:59,060
(laughing)

1047
00:39:59,060 --> 00:40:03,100
- Use code beers for $1 off.

1048
00:40:03,100 --> 00:40:05,780
- What if he did something where it was like

1049
00:40:05,780 --> 00:40:08,660
you could do prop bets, like it was a live stream.

1050
00:40:08,660 --> 00:40:09,500
- Yeah.

1051
00:40:09,500 --> 00:40:11,820
- And it's like the bet for what color

1052
00:40:11,820 --> 00:40:13,300
the Gatorade is gonna be.

1053
00:40:13,300 --> 00:40:15,940
It's like what liquid does he have behind the lemon today?

1054
00:40:15,940 --> 00:40:17,980
'Cause maybe they just do water the first episode,

1055
00:40:17,980 --> 00:40:18,940
but by the fourth episode,

1056
00:40:18,940 --> 00:40:21,460
he's spitting out KSI and Logan Paul's "Prime."

1057
00:40:21,460 --> 00:40:22,300
- Yeah.

1058
00:40:22,300 --> 00:40:26,460
- This is no longer like a podcast idea,

1059
00:40:26,460 --> 00:40:28,360
but it's more like a TikTok live idea.

1060
00:40:28,360 --> 00:40:31,060
- I don't know the difference.

1061
00:40:31,060 --> 00:40:33,540
TikTok this, Instagram that.

1062
00:40:33,540 --> 00:40:36,540
We're using all trails to find out the best hiking spots.

1063
00:40:36,540 --> 00:40:39,540
I can't keep these apps separate in my brain anymore.

1064
00:40:39,540 --> 00:40:42,620
- You've never seen like a TikTok live type thing?

1065
00:40:42,620 --> 00:40:45,180
- These are all the same to me, okay?

1066
00:40:45,180 --> 00:40:47,060
Let me pull up the apps I have on my phone.

1067
00:40:47,060 --> 00:40:49,300
I can't even, I couldn't even tell you what these are.

1068
00:40:49,300 --> 00:40:51,060
- God, this Bud Light is awful.

1069
00:40:51,060 --> 00:40:52,300
- Dunkin'.

1070
00:40:52,300 --> 00:40:53,620
- I'm drinking two of 'em.

1071
00:40:53,620 --> 00:40:54,620
You have the Dunkin' app?

1072
00:40:54,620 --> 00:40:55,460
- Sheets.

1073
00:40:55,460 --> 00:40:57,660
Domino's.

1074
00:40:57,660 --> 00:40:58,660
- No. - Well, it's not good

1075
00:40:58,660 --> 00:41:00,580
that two of the three have been food so far.

1076
00:41:00,580 --> 00:41:01,980
- I think all three have been food.

1077
00:41:01,980 --> 00:41:03,700
The Sheets app is also food.

1078
00:41:03,700 --> 00:41:04,540
- Well, Sheet.

1079
00:41:04,540 --> 00:41:06,300
(both laughing)

1080
00:41:06,300 --> 00:41:08,140
Well, it's actually Google Sheets.

1081
00:41:08,140 --> 00:41:10,620
Wait, he's taking a phone call in the middle of the show?

1082
00:41:10,620 --> 00:41:11,940
Home Depot.

1083
00:41:11,940 --> 00:41:13,600
Who, God only knows.

1084
00:41:13,600 --> 00:41:17,520
Balls, B-A-L-L-Z, that's a video game, I do know that one.

1085
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:21,040
Zelle, Zillow, what is Zille, is that another restaurant?

1086
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:23,720
My Instant Soundboard.

1087
00:41:23,720 --> 00:41:30,180
But yeah, so that's just a little look into my phone.

1088
00:41:30,180 --> 00:41:31,860
If you've ever wanted to get into my phone,

1089
00:41:31,860 --> 00:41:33,020
which by the way you can't,

1090
00:41:33,020 --> 00:41:34,620
because my pin code is very secure

1091
00:41:34,620 --> 00:41:35,460
and it's nothing like the pin code for--

1092
00:41:35,460 --> 00:41:37,140
- 111. - Ah, fuck you,

1093
00:41:37,140 --> 00:41:37,980
how'd you know?

1094
00:41:37,980 --> 00:41:41,900
No, it's actually a six digit pin code,

1095
00:41:41,900 --> 00:41:43,300
I said it is a six digit.

1096
00:41:43,300 --> 00:41:46,980
The only thing I like about my phone is the fact that I put the

1097
00:41:46,980 --> 00:41:50,100
pictures widget on the top.

1098
00:41:50,100 --> 00:41:50,900
Yeah.

1099
00:41:50,900 --> 00:41:53,300
So I always get like a funny picture on there.

1100
00:41:53,300 --> 00:41:54,740
Right now it's a picture of me.

1101
00:41:54,740 --> 00:41:57,380
I do like funny pictures, man.

1102
00:41:57,380 --> 00:41:58,980
I'm not going to lie.

1103
00:41:58,980 --> 00:42:00,260
It's a picture of my friends.

1104
00:42:00,260 --> 00:42:01,940
It's now it's doing.

1105
00:42:01,940 --> 00:42:04,660
Oh, here's an idea for an app.

1106
00:42:04,660 --> 00:42:07,140
If you needed another idea for an app.

1107
00:42:07,140 --> 00:42:12,980
What if there was an app where you could instantly sue somebody?

1108
00:42:12,980 --> 00:42:17,360
Like it filed instantly to like a small claims court

1109
00:42:17,360 --> 00:42:18,200
or something.

1110
00:42:18,200 --> 00:42:20,420
It just did all that paperwork for you and sent it in.

1111
00:42:20,420 --> 00:42:23,820
'Cause they have the AI traffic lawyers.

1112
00:42:23,820 --> 00:42:24,660
- Yes.

1113
00:42:24,660 --> 00:42:25,900
- But not for small claims court.

1114
00:42:25,900 --> 00:42:28,340
So if you get the wrong order.

1115
00:42:28,340 --> 00:42:29,880
- It actually does exist.

1116
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:31,340
- It does exist?

1117
00:42:31,340 --> 00:42:32,240
This exists?

1118
00:42:32,240 --> 00:42:33,220
- It's an app?

1119
00:42:33,220 --> 00:42:34,060
- Oh God dammit.

1120
00:42:34,060 --> 00:42:35,580
- There's a lawyer app.

1121
00:42:35,580 --> 00:42:36,420
- What?

1122
00:42:36,420 --> 00:42:38,340
- That does every like lawyer action for you.

1123
00:42:38,340 --> 00:42:39,740
- The McDonald's lawyer app?

1124
00:42:39,740 --> 00:42:42,060
- For slip and fall?

1125
00:42:42,060 --> 00:42:48,060
I mean, maybe not for a slip and fall, but it'll write you a lawyerly email.

1126
00:42:48,060 --> 00:42:49,060
You can probably send an email.

1127
00:42:49,060 --> 00:42:52,420
I would be sending them a cease and desist.

1128
00:42:52,420 --> 00:42:59,020
I think like simplifying processes like the way, like the one, like the stock app did

1129
00:42:59,020 --> 00:43:00,020
during COVID.

1130
00:43:00,020 --> 00:43:01,020
I forgot what it's called.

1131
00:43:01,020 --> 00:43:02,020
Robinhood.

1132
00:43:02,020 --> 00:43:03,020
Robinhood.

1133
00:43:03,020 --> 00:43:07,460
More apps like that, I think that would be perfect to get $1 million and then like completely

1134
00:43:07,460 --> 00:43:09,220
crash or something like that.

1135
00:43:09,220 --> 00:43:12,420
like the lawyer app and more complicated stuff

1136
00:43:12,420 --> 00:43:13,820
that people usually don't do

1137
00:43:13,820 --> 00:43:16,700
because it takes so much money to do.

1138
00:43:16,700 --> 00:43:17,540
- Yeah.

1139
00:43:17,540 --> 00:43:19,700
- That is honestly how you should,

1140
00:43:19,700 --> 00:43:21,180
what you should be trying to do now

1141
00:43:21,180 --> 00:43:22,980
is you should be trying to make an app

1142
00:43:22,980 --> 00:43:26,380
that it's never possible for it to make any money at all.

1143
00:43:26,380 --> 00:43:29,300
You should be getting as much VC as possible.

1144
00:43:29,300 --> 00:43:31,460
And then you should be filing for bankruptcy.

1145
00:43:31,460 --> 00:43:34,140
- Yeah, my new app gives you health insurance

1146
00:43:34,140 --> 00:43:35,860
for $1 a month.

1147
00:43:35,860 --> 00:43:36,940
- Yeah.

1148
00:43:36,940 --> 00:43:39,740
- Oh, I heard, I was listening to some old podcast

1149
00:43:39,740 --> 00:43:42,860
the other day and they were talking about Dollar Shave Club,

1150
00:43:42,860 --> 00:43:45,380
which Dollar Shave Club is still around as a razor brand,

1151
00:43:45,380 --> 00:43:48,580
but they do not do the $1 thing anymore, I don't believe.

1152
00:43:48,580 --> 00:43:50,620
Because that makes no sense at all.

1153
00:43:50,620 --> 00:43:52,500
You can't sell razors for $1.

1154
00:43:52,500 --> 00:43:55,620
- What's it like a refill for $1?

1155
00:43:55,620 --> 00:43:58,420
- Yeah, it was like you get five razors a month for $1.

1156
00:43:58,420 --> 00:44:01,900
But I buy the fucking razors at the Walgreens

1157
00:44:01,900 --> 00:44:03,780
and they're 15 bucks.

1158
00:44:03,780 --> 00:44:04,620
- Yeah.

1159
00:44:04,620 --> 00:44:06,340
- Okay, that's crazy.

1160
00:44:06,340 --> 00:44:08,260
- It makes no sense, how did they do that for any amount?

1161
00:44:08,260 --> 00:44:11,340
- You also, you don't need five razors a month.

1162
00:44:11,340 --> 00:44:12,720
- I do.

1163
00:44:12,720 --> 00:44:14,140
- Yeah, he's going through it.

1164
00:44:14,140 --> 00:44:14,980
He's got a head to shave.

1165
00:44:14,980 --> 00:44:16,700
- Oh, I go through so fast.

1166
00:44:16,700 --> 00:44:19,700
I go through a razor every four days probably.

1167
00:44:19,700 --> 00:44:20,540
- Really?

1168
00:44:20,540 --> 00:44:21,760
- Yeah, it sucks.

1169
00:44:21,760 --> 00:44:25,620
And if I use an old razor, I almost always slice off

1170
00:44:25,620 --> 00:44:27,300
like half of my head.

1171
00:44:27,300 --> 00:44:28,900
It happened the other day.

1172
00:44:28,900 --> 00:44:31,660
- You and I, we're shaving here.

1173
00:44:31,660 --> 00:44:35,140
And there's, for you, the only part you need to shave

1174
00:44:35,140 --> 00:44:36,760
is right this part.

1175
00:44:36,760 --> 00:44:39,980
- Well, I actually shaved my entire face.

1176
00:44:39,980 --> 00:44:40,820
Thank you very much.

1177
00:44:40,820 --> 00:44:41,780
- Well, not you, I'm talking to Julio.

1178
00:44:41,780 --> 00:44:42,620
- Oh, okay.

1179
00:44:42,620 --> 00:44:44,940
- I did it, I shaved you the other day.

1180
00:44:44,940 --> 00:44:45,780
- I know.

1181
00:44:45,780 --> 00:44:46,620
- A really clean guy.

1182
00:44:46,620 --> 00:44:47,940
- See, no, that's not a clean shave.

1183
00:44:47,940 --> 00:44:49,060
You do not have a clean shave.

1184
00:44:49,060 --> 00:44:50,740
- Well, it's been a couple days.

1185
00:44:50,740 --> 00:44:52,960
- That's probably three days, I'm gonna guess.

1186
00:44:52,960 --> 00:44:54,620
- I don't remember.

1187
00:44:54,620 --> 00:44:56,060
- It's three, trust me on this.

1188
00:44:56,060 --> 00:44:57,980
I know this kind of thing very well.

1189
00:44:57,980 --> 00:45:01,340
Me, I shaved yesterday, it's already coming in again,

1190
00:45:01,340 --> 00:45:02,180
and my head is--

1191
00:45:02,180 --> 00:45:03,660
- Do you walk around the city,

1192
00:45:03,660 --> 00:45:07,220
inspecting people's faces and their facial hair

1193
00:45:07,220 --> 00:45:08,140
and being like-- - No!

1194
00:45:08,140 --> 00:45:09,580
- Seven days, five days,

1195
00:45:09,580 --> 00:45:10,420
this morning, two days. - No, I just do it

1196
00:45:10,420 --> 00:45:12,540
when somebody claims that they're clean shaven

1197
00:45:12,540 --> 00:45:13,380
and they're not.

1198
00:45:13,380 --> 00:45:15,900
- I don't think that's true.

1199
00:45:15,900 --> 00:45:18,580
I think you're hiding something.

1200
00:45:18,580 --> 00:45:19,420
You're hiding a secret.

1201
00:45:19,420 --> 00:45:21,980
- I will say, I look very far down

1202
00:45:21,980 --> 00:45:26,220
from a very high place at men who are bald

1203
00:45:26,220 --> 00:45:27,220
but they're half-stepping it

1204
00:45:27,220 --> 00:45:29,420
and they don't have a clean shaven head.

1205
00:45:29,420 --> 00:45:30,780
That is disgusting to me.

1206
00:45:32,900 --> 00:45:34,820
- That is fucking disgusting.

1207
00:45:34,820 --> 00:45:37,920
- Looking at a lot of pictures of Stavros recently.

1208
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:40,980
- Yeah, well he has long hair though.

1209
00:45:40,980 --> 00:45:45,980
Like if you have a, just say like a six day grow out

1210
00:45:45,980 --> 00:45:49,700
on your head, like kind of a shadow,

1211
00:45:49,700 --> 00:45:52,660
get rid of that thing, man.

1212
00:45:52,660 --> 00:45:54,220
You know what I get asked sometimes?

1213
00:45:54,220 --> 00:45:57,100
I get asked sometimes, because my head is so clean shaven,

1214
00:45:57,100 --> 00:45:59,860
people will ask me if I was going bald

1215
00:45:59,860 --> 00:46:01,560
or I decided just to shave my head,

1216
00:46:01,560 --> 00:46:04,840
'cause they can't even tell, 'cause it's such a close shave.

1217
00:46:04,840 --> 00:46:06,960
- Right, they can't even see where it grows in.

1218
00:46:06,960 --> 00:46:09,920
- Exactly, they don't see the awful horseshoe,

1219
00:46:09,920 --> 00:46:11,920
the Larry David horseshoe that I have growing

1220
00:46:11,920 --> 00:46:13,160
on the top of my head.

1221
00:46:13,160 --> 00:46:14,160
- I think-- - But the thing is,

1222
00:46:14,160 --> 00:46:18,540
Larry David would look horrible fully shaved bald.

1223
00:46:18,540 --> 00:46:22,200
And you could do that.

1224
00:46:22,200 --> 00:46:23,680
- No, I couldn't do that.

1225
00:46:23,680 --> 00:46:26,040
I've tried growing my hair out, it's bad.

1226
00:46:26,040 --> 00:46:28,120
- At this point, Larry David has claimed

1227
00:46:28,120 --> 00:46:30,460
that haircut for his people.

1228
00:46:30,460 --> 00:46:36,380
I think if we see someone walking around

1229
00:46:36,380 --> 00:46:37,920
with that type of haircut, I'm assuming they are--

1230
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:39,420
- You're saying Larry David.

1231
00:46:39,420 --> 00:46:41,640
- I'm assuming they're a certain type of guy.

1232
00:46:41,640 --> 00:46:43,840
- Larry David, I mean, that's fair,

1233
00:46:43,840 --> 00:46:45,960
but Larry David-- - Of a certain type of faith.

1234
00:46:45,960 --> 00:46:48,560
- Is a handsome fellow, he just happens to be bald.

1235
00:46:48,560 --> 00:46:50,760
- Larry David is not handsome.

1236
00:46:50,760 --> 00:46:51,820
Are you crazy?

1237
00:46:51,820 --> 00:46:52,980
- He's an old man.

1238
00:46:52,980 --> 00:46:55,680
He's eight years old. - He's an old ugly fart.

1239
00:46:55,680 --> 00:46:58,180
- He's fucking fat too.

1240
00:46:58,180 --> 00:46:59,660
- And it says the end of it on the show,

1241
00:46:59,660 --> 00:47:01,560
which I find disgusting.

1242
00:47:01,560 --> 00:47:05,660
- He's an appalling, abhorrent piece of shit.

1243
00:47:05,660 --> 00:47:08,320
And also, by the way, he's rude.

1244
00:47:08,320 --> 00:47:10,600
Near constantly.

1245
00:47:10,600 --> 00:47:13,180
- On his show even.

1246
00:47:13,180 --> 00:47:15,680
He doesn't care about showing how horrible--

1247
00:47:15,680 --> 00:47:17,000
- If I was him--

1248
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:18,120
- A president's wife.

1249
00:47:18,120 --> 00:47:20,520
- If I was him, you know what I'd be doing?

1250
00:47:20,520 --> 00:47:23,520
Editing out my rudeness from my show.

1251
00:47:24,520 --> 00:47:26,720
What is this guy thinking?

1252
00:47:26,720 --> 00:47:28,640
The whole world knows he's rude, buddy.

1253
00:47:28,640 --> 00:47:32,160
- Yeah, does he know he said the N-word like 11 times?

1254
00:47:32,160 --> 00:47:34,040
- It's okay to blow up behind the scenes.

1255
00:47:34,040 --> 00:47:35,280
Every actor does it.

1256
00:47:35,280 --> 00:47:38,560
I do it on almost every Home Planet video that we shoot.

1257
00:47:38,560 --> 00:47:41,640
But you're supposed to cut it out, okay?

1258
00:47:41,640 --> 00:47:43,160
Don't add that.

1259
00:47:43,160 --> 00:47:45,500
I mean, whoever's editing that show needs to be fired.

1260
00:47:45,500 --> 00:47:46,460
I'll say that much.

1261
00:47:46,460 --> 00:47:49,360
- Do you think you could do, like I said,

1262
00:47:49,360 --> 00:47:51,600
come about your life, Caleb, as a comedian?

1263
00:47:53,020 --> 00:47:55,300
My life is that I sit at home and I play video games

1264
00:47:55,300 --> 00:47:57,540
and then I clean the house right before my wife gets home.

1265
00:47:57,540 --> 00:47:58,700
That'd be the worst.

1266
00:47:58,700 --> 00:47:59,540
- Like a show girl.

1267
00:47:59,540 --> 00:48:01,300
- Did you ever watch the, what's that comedian

1268
00:48:01,300 --> 00:48:03,940
that got canceled for being too rude to his wife?

1269
00:48:03,940 --> 00:48:08,100
The girl he loves so much, fuck.

1270
00:48:08,100 --> 00:48:10,460
- Oh, are you talking about the nerd?

1271
00:48:10,460 --> 00:48:11,300
- Yeah.

1272
00:48:11,300 --> 00:48:12,380
- Who are you talking about?

1273
00:48:12,380 --> 00:48:14,380
- Points, At Midnight.

1274
00:48:14,380 --> 00:48:15,220
- No, not At Midnight.

1275
00:48:15,220 --> 00:48:16,040
- Chris Hardwick.

1276
00:48:16,040 --> 00:48:18,700
- No, not Chris Hardwick, the other guy.

1277
00:48:18,700 --> 00:48:19,540
The guy who--

1278
00:48:19,540 --> 00:48:20,580
- But he's also a nerd?

1279
00:48:20,580 --> 00:48:21,540
- He's also a nerd.

1280
00:48:21,540 --> 00:48:23,060
- Did he talk about his middle ditch?

1281
00:48:23,060 --> 00:48:25,780
- No, the guy who talks like really high pitch

1282
00:48:25,780 --> 00:48:27,700
has had a Jewish wife and he would

1283
00:48:27,700 --> 00:48:28,540
completely talk about it all the time.

1284
00:48:28,540 --> 00:48:29,860
- John Mulaney.

1285
00:48:29,860 --> 00:48:30,900
- Yes.

1286
00:48:30,900 --> 00:48:33,900
You ever watch his show, like the pilot of his show?

1287
00:48:33,900 --> 00:48:34,740
- Oh, it's terrible.

1288
00:48:34,740 --> 00:48:35,660
(burps)

1289
00:48:35,660 --> 00:48:37,900
- I remember watching the first episode

1290
00:48:37,900 --> 00:48:40,620
and he was just like, he was just like reenacting

1291
00:48:40,620 --> 00:48:44,500
one of his jokes that he would say on his stand up.

1292
00:48:44,500 --> 00:48:46,140
- Yeah, it's like the worst show ever.

1293
00:48:46,140 --> 00:48:47,940
- And it was really bad.

1294
00:48:47,940 --> 00:48:50,260
- That was in like one or two years,

1295
00:48:50,260 --> 00:48:53,660
he got a show and then Pete Holmes got a show.

1296
00:48:53,660 --> 00:48:54,740
And then they both did that.

1297
00:48:54,740 --> 00:48:57,380
They both just did like jokes from their standup

1298
00:48:57,380 --> 00:48:59,820
turned into TV episodes.

1299
00:48:59,820 --> 00:49:00,660
- Here's a fun one.

1300
00:49:00,660 --> 00:49:04,080
If you could go back in time and erase a show from history,

1301
00:49:04,080 --> 00:49:05,080
which would you do?

1302
00:49:05,080 --> 00:49:07,180
- Give me those.

1303
00:49:07,180 --> 00:49:09,340
- For me, it would be Netflix, The Characters.

1304
00:49:09,340 --> 00:49:11,500
- That is a, well. - I don't know what that is.

1305
00:49:11,500 --> 00:49:12,780
What is it?

1306
00:49:12,780 --> 00:49:15,140
- Okay, give me your reasoning why.

1307
00:49:15,140 --> 00:49:18,620
- I think You Should Leave would not exist.

1308
00:49:19,660 --> 00:49:21,140
- And you don't like I Think You Should Leave?

1309
00:49:21,140 --> 00:49:22,740
- I think it's horrible.

1310
00:49:22,740 --> 00:49:26,140
And I think every woman would agree with me.

1311
00:49:26,140 --> 00:49:28,400
(laughing)

1312
00:49:28,400 --> 00:49:31,980
- Oh, okay, I see your ploy here.

1313
00:49:31,980 --> 00:49:32,820
- Yeah.

1314
00:49:32,820 --> 00:49:35,220
- I would probably--

1315
00:49:35,220 --> 00:49:37,140
- Well, you know I've always found that show

1316
00:49:37,140 --> 00:49:39,580
to be distasteful.

1317
00:49:39,580 --> 00:49:41,020
- That's a good show, man.

1318
00:49:41,020 --> 00:49:41,860
- No.

1319
00:49:41,860 --> 00:49:42,680
- You think it's distasteful?

1320
00:49:42,680 --> 00:49:44,740
You don't like cussing, you've said this before.

1321
00:49:44,740 --> 00:49:47,340
- I don't like when he just repeats stuff.

1322
00:49:48,660 --> 00:49:53,660
- Yeah, I mean, you know, it's just a character show.

1323
00:49:53,660 --> 00:49:57,980
I will say the characters except for,

1324
00:49:57,980 --> 00:50:01,160
he has probably the funniest episode of the characters.

1325
00:50:01,160 --> 00:50:03,880
- Yes. - And him or John Early.

1326
00:50:03,880 --> 00:50:06,500
But besides those, that show is very kind of

1327
00:50:06,500 --> 00:50:09,500
take it or leave it for me, hit or miss.

1328
00:50:09,500 --> 00:50:12,380
There's a lot of bad choices on that show.

1329
00:50:12,380 --> 00:50:16,180
I would eliminate the news.

1330
00:50:18,180 --> 00:50:20,580
- Fox News, just every news. - I don't need to know all that!

1331
00:50:20,580 --> 00:50:23,700
- The news! - Put more cartoons on!

1332
00:50:23,700 --> 00:50:27,620
Yeah, what the hell? You're interrupting my shit to tell me about fucking what?

1333
00:50:27,620 --> 00:50:29,620
Ukraine, 9/11, I don't care.

1334
00:50:29,620 --> 00:50:32,180
- Pull out Bob's Burgers! - Wait, what the fuck?

1335
00:50:32,180 --> 00:50:33,940
What channel does this?

1336
00:50:33,940 --> 00:50:35,380
The news!

1337
00:50:35,380 --> 00:50:38,020
- They interrupt, my dad still, to this day... - NBC?

1338
00:50:38,020 --> 00:50:40,100
- Does cartoons have news? - My dad talks about...

1339
00:50:40,100 --> 00:50:42,580
My dad still talks about how...

1340
00:50:42,580 --> 00:50:45,860
the September 11th news report...

1341
00:50:45,860 --> 00:50:49,300
interrupted a rerun of Seinfeld that he hadn't seen.

1342
00:50:49,300 --> 00:50:51,460
- Oh, I would be pissed.

1343
00:50:51,460 --> 00:50:53,100
- And he was just so mad.

1344
00:50:53,100 --> 00:50:54,740
- I would enlist immediately.

1345
00:50:54,740 --> 00:50:56,140
- Yeah, yeah.

1346
00:50:56,140 --> 00:50:58,200
It made him so mad. - It's time for revenge.

1347
00:50:58,200 --> 00:50:59,860
- Anytime 9/11 is brought up, he's like,

1348
00:50:59,860 --> 00:51:01,260
and they fucking, I mean,

1349
00:51:01,260 --> 00:51:04,100
they interrupted this episode of Seinfeld.

1350
00:51:04,100 --> 00:51:05,300
It's like, what?

1351
00:51:05,300 --> 00:51:07,300
How un-American can you be?

1352
00:51:07,300 --> 00:51:08,980
- Wait, I have a question about this,

1353
00:51:08,980 --> 00:51:10,780
about your answer.

1354
00:51:10,780 --> 00:51:13,540
Has he gone back and watched that episode that he missed?

1355
00:51:13,540 --> 00:51:15,180
(laughing)

1356
00:51:15,180 --> 00:51:16,180
- I actually know he did.

1357
00:51:16,180 --> 00:51:17,700
I know when Netflix came out,

1358
00:51:17,700 --> 00:51:19,380
he watched all of Seinfeld

1359
00:51:19,380 --> 00:51:21,740
and he said he was doing it to fill in the gaps.

1360
00:51:21,740 --> 00:51:23,820
- That's great.

1361
00:51:23,820 --> 00:51:26,300
- Did you see that when they air reruns of Seinfeld,

1362
00:51:26,300 --> 00:51:28,880
they speed it up 7%?

1363
00:51:28,880 --> 00:51:30,940
- Oh, I forgot about that.

1364
00:51:30,940 --> 00:51:35,220
- Because, so original Seinfeld is a 25 minute episode.

1365
00:51:35,220 --> 00:51:36,060
- Oh.

1366
00:51:36,060 --> 00:51:38,380
- But modern episodes need to be 22 minutes long,

1367
00:51:38,380 --> 00:51:41,300
so they just speed it up a little bit

1368
00:51:41,300 --> 00:51:43,060
so that it's 22 minutes long.

1369
00:51:43,060 --> 00:51:44,260
- Do they do it with every old show?

1370
00:51:44,260 --> 00:51:45,620
they do that with like cheers?

1371
00:51:45,620 --> 00:51:46,580
- I think so.

1372
00:51:46,580 --> 00:51:49,340
- Is that why they don't rerun those old shows much?

1373
00:51:49,340 --> 00:51:52,300
They only rerun like Big Bang Theory

1374
00:51:52,300 --> 00:51:53,580
and How I Met Your Mother?

1375
00:51:53,580 --> 00:51:54,780
- I think so.

1376
00:51:54,780 --> 00:51:57,380
- Do you, okay, now I gotta ask you guys a question.

1377
00:51:57,380 --> 00:51:59,140
I don't think either of you know

1378
00:51:59,140 --> 00:52:01,460
what gets rerun these days.

1379
00:52:01,460 --> 00:52:05,060
I don't think either of you have watched cable TV in years.

1380
00:52:05,060 --> 00:52:06,140
- It has been years.

1381
00:52:06,140 --> 00:52:06,980
- Yeah, that's been a long time.

1382
00:52:06,980 --> 00:52:08,220
- It has, I won't lie to you.

1383
00:52:08,220 --> 00:52:09,900
I wanna lie so bad.

1384
00:52:09,900 --> 00:52:10,740
Actually, I'll lie.

1385
00:52:10,740 --> 00:52:12,220
I have cable, I watch it every day.

1386
00:52:12,220 --> 00:52:13,180
- You don't have cable.

1387
00:52:13,180 --> 00:52:14,420
- I do, I just told you that.

1388
00:52:14,420 --> 00:52:15,260
You're gonna come here?

1389
00:52:15,260 --> 00:52:16,080
- Dude, I love TV.

1390
00:52:16,080 --> 00:52:19,060
TV's so sick, but I don't have cable either.

1391
00:52:19,060 --> 00:52:20,220
I love prior TV. - I don't really care

1392
00:52:20,220 --> 00:52:22,500
about TV that much.

1393
00:52:22,500 --> 00:52:25,520
- I think you do.

1394
00:52:25,520 --> 00:52:26,360
- I mean-- - No.

1395
00:52:26,360 --> 00:52:27,260
- You love Pluto. - I wish there just

1396
00:52:27,260 --> 00:52:29,340
wasn't ads.

1397
00:52:29,340 --> 00:52:30,260
- Yeah.

1398
00:52:30,260 --> 00:52:31,300
- I hate 'em.

1399
00:52:31,300 --> 00:52:32,560
I hate ads.

1400
00:52:32,560 --> 00:52:35,020
- You love Pluto TV.

1401
00:52:35,020 --> 00:52:35,900
You're lying about TV.

1402
00:52:35,900 --> 00:52:37,540
- I don't even watch Pluto TV anymore.

1403
00:52:37,540 --> 00:52:39,380
That was like a two-week phase of my life

1404
00:52:39,380 --> 00:52:40,220
that I watched Pluto TV.

1405
00:52:40,220 --> 00:52:44,900
- When I was in town, we sat in Cam's apartment

1406
00:52:44,900 --> 00:52:48,460
for like two hours just watching all Jeopardy! episodes

1407
00:52:48,460 --> 00:52:51,060
on Pluto TV, and you were loving it.

1408
00:52:51,060 --> 00:52:51,900
- Okay, but Jeopardy! is dope.

1409
00:52:51,900 --> 00:52:53,060
- Well, Jeopardy! is a different thing.

1410
00:52:53,060 --> 00:52:54,340
Jeopardy! is dope.

1411
00:52:54,340 --> 00:52:55,280
- It's TV.

1412
00:52:55,280 --> 00:52:57,300
Jeopardy! is TV.

1413
00:52:57,300 --> 00:52:58,940
- Oh my God.

1414
00:52:58,940 --> 00:52:59,780
- This is--

1415
00:52:59,780 --> 00:53:01,980
- That is the dumbest argument I've ever heard.

1416
00:53:01,980 --> 00:53:04,820
- We were at Cam's house, we were trying to kill time.

1417
00:53:04,820 --> 00:53:06,060
It was either watch Jeopardy!

1418
00:53:06,060 --> 00:53:08,400
or watch like the worst movie ever.

1419
00:53:08,400 --> 00:53:11,320
I don't sit around watching TV like that.

1420
00:53:11,320 --> 00:53:13,240
- I, no.

1421
00:53:13,240 --> 00:53:15,080
- What are you talking about?

1422
00:53:15,080 --> 00:53:18,480
Jeopardy! airs for 30 minutes every day.

1423
00:53:18,480 --> 00:53:19,600
That's not TV.

1424
00:53:19,600 --> 00:53:21,360
That's an episode of a TV show.

1425
00:53:21,360 --> 00:53:24,200
- Jeopardy! also is more like a job for me.

1426
00:53:24,200 --> 00:53:25,160
- If it's on the television, it's TV.

1427
00:53:25,160 --> 00:53:26,200
What do you mean?

1428
00:53:26,200 --> 00:53:28,040
- I'm sitting there and I'm trying my hardest.

1429
00:53:28,040 --> 00:53:30,720
I have beads of sweat just running down my face,

1430
00:53:30,720 --> 00:53:33,880
over my nose, dripping onto my couch.

1431
00:53:33,880 --> 00:53:36,200
That is not, I'm just not entertaining.

1432
00:53:36,200 --> 00:53:37,280
I'm not being entertained.

1433
00:53:37,280 --> 00:53:38,240
I'm working.

1434
00:53:38,240 --> 00:53:40,040
- We should send it to a game show.

1435
00:53:40,040 --> 00:53:42,300
- I'm trying to beat my mom so, so badly.

1436
00:53:42,300 --> 00:53:43,920
I would be amazing on a game show.

1437
00:53:43,920 --> 00:53:44,760
- Yeah, which one?

1438
00:53:44,760 --> 00:53:46,360
- Go ahead, introduce me on a game show.

1439
00:53:46,360 --> 00:53:47,640
Just whatever game show.

1440
00:53:47,640 --> 00:53:50,840
- Okay, and from North Carolina,

1441
00:53:50,840 --> 00:53:54,360
he's 26 years old, 35 years old.

1442
00:53:54,360 --> 00:53:55,960
I forgot how old he is.

1443
00:53:55,960 --> 00:53:56,960
- 26.

1444
00:53:56,960 --> 00:54:00,840
- 26, he is a comedian from New York City.

1445
00:54:00,840 --> 00:54:03,840
Say hello to Caleb Pitts.

1446
00:54:03,840 --> 00:54:07,120
- Oh, what's up America?

1447
00:54:07,120 --> 00:54:10,440
- So Caleb, it says here that you have a little show,

1448
00:54:10,440 --> 00:54:11,760
you have a podcast.

1449
00:54:11,760 --> 00:54:15,580
- Yeah, yeah, shout it out now,

1450
00:54:15,580 --> 00:54:18,160
in a belly call me, yeah, yeah.

1451
00:54:18,160 --> 00:54:19,860
- Yes I do, Jubio.

1452
00:54:19,860 --> 00:54:20,700
- Okay.

1453
00:54:20,700 --> 00:54:23,880
- Mr.

1454
00:54:23,880 --> 00:54:24,720
- Yeah, so what do you--

1455
00:54:24,720 --> 00:54:25,980
- Yes I do, mister.

1456
00:54:25,980 --> 00:54:28,080
- Okay, so what are you here for?

1457
00:54:28,080 --> 00:54:29,880
What are you playing for?

1458
00:54:29,880 --> 00:54:32,920
- Steve, I'm playing to win it all.

1459
00:54:32,920 --> 00:54:35,600
- That's it, you don't wanna use the money

1460
00:54:35,600 --> 00:54:38,160
to like buy a house or get married?

1461
00:54:38,160 --> 00:54:39,000
- No, no.

1462
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:41,160
(humming)

1463
00:54:41,160 --> 00:54:43,000
- Okay.

1464
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:45,840
- Can I open my second beer at this 53 minute mark?

1465
00:54:45,840 --> 00:54:46,720
- Yes.

1466
00:54:46,720 --> 00:54:48,480
- Let that thing fly.

1467
00:54:48,480 --> 00:54:50,760
- I'm almost done with this one and I'm feeling--

1468
00:54:50,760 --> 00:54:51,600
- What's this?

1469
00:54:51,600 --> 00:54:54,100
Oh my God, Bud Light Seltzer Hard Soda.

1470
00:54:54,100 --> 00:54:57,060
- Bud Light Seltzer Hard Soda.

1471
00:54:57,060 --> 00:54:58,640
- I forgot about those.

1472
00:54:58,640 --> 00:54:59,840
- Classic Cola.

1473
00:54:59,840 --> 00:55:02,680
In honor of aspartame becoming a carcinogen.

1474
00:55:02,680 --> 00:55:04,720
- Just about to say.

1475
00:55:04,720 --> 00:55:07,460
Here's the thing about aspartame, man.

1476
00:55:07,460 --> 00:55:09,520
I mean, that came out of nowhere, that news.

1477
00:55:09,520 --> 00:55:10,840
- I can't believe it.

1478
00:55:10,840 --> 00:55:14,360
- I thought that aspartame was only in light sodas,

1479
00:55:14,360 --> 00:55:15,840
not in every soda.

1480
00:55:15,840 --> 00:55:17,600
- It is in light sodas, but it's also,

1481
00:55:17,600 --> 00:55:21,200
any kind of alcoholic soda is usually artificially sweetened,

1482
00:55:21,200 --> 00:55:25,440
so that because they, if they used full sugar,

1483
00:55:25,440 --> 00:55:28,920
it'd be like a 400 calorie fucking can of beer,

1484
00:55:28,920 --> 00:55:31,400
because it's got alcohol in it.

1485
00:55:32,720 --> 00:55:33,560
- And alcohol. - So you think--

1486
00:55:33,560 --> 00:55:37,480
- Whereas this only has 210 in this big ass can.

1487
00:55:37,480 --> 00:55:38,920
- Yeah, that's nothing. - Look at this thing.

1488
00:55:38,920 --> 00:55:40,400
- Of aspartame?

1489
00:55:40,400 --> 00:55:42,320
(belching)

1490
00:55:42,320 --> 00:55:45,360
Do you think now that it's being considered a carcinogen,

1491
00:55:45,360 --> 00:55:48,800
there's gonna be like aspartame like truthers?

1492
00:55:48,800 --> 00:55:50,360
- Yeah. - I mean, people

1493
00:55:50,360 --> 00:55:53,000
have hated on aspartame forever.

1494
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:56,640
- Yeah, but now that it's being like officially

1495
00:55:56,640 --> 00:55:59,600
being told by Joe Brandon that it's bad,

1496
00:55:59,600 --> 00:56:00,880
do you think that's gonna be truthers?

1497
00:56:00,880 --> 00:56:02,120
They're like, you know what?

1498
00:56:02,120 --> 00:56:03,340
Actually, it was good.

1499
00:56:03,340 --> 00:56:06,300
- Oh, people like, what's that guy's name?

1500
00:56:06,300 --> 00:56:10,600
Dan something, who thinks Stevia is a miracle cure.

1501
00:56:10,600 --> 00:56:11,620
- Yeah, something like that.

1502
00:56:11,620 --> 00:56:13,420
- Stevia tastes like shit, by the way.

1503
00:56:13,420 --> 00:56:14,860
If you put Stevia in your coffee,

1504
00:56:14,860 --> 00:56:17,620
you have something, you have an absolute brain damage.

1505
00:56:17,620 --> 00:56:18,900
- I cannot tell the difference

1506
00:56:18,900 --> 00:56:21,700
between any sugar or sugar replacement.

1507
00:56:21,700 --> 00:56:23,780
- You have an undefined palate.

1508
00:56:23,780 --> 00:56:25,500
- They're all sweet.

1509
00:56:25,500 --> 00:56:27,020
What's the difference?

1510
00:56:27,020 --> 00:56:29,620
- The difference is the aftertaste.

1511
00:56:29,620 --> 00:56:31,380
- I don't give a fucking shit about the aftertaste.

1512
00:56:31,380 --> 00:56:32,540
There's coffee in it.

1513
00:56:32,540 --> 00:56:34,340
- No, the aftertaste matters.

1514
00:56:34,340 --> 00:56:35,180
- The aftertaste does matter.

1515
00:56:35,180 --> 00:56:38,900
- It's in my coffee and my four things of cream.

1516
00:56:38,900 --> 00:56:40,660
I can't even taste it anymore.

1517
00:56:40,660 --> 00:56:44,980
- All right, I got a new thing.

1518
00:56:44,980 --> 00:56:47,340
I just wanna shout out Adrifuel Labs,

1519
00:56:47,340 --> 00:56:50,740
which has basically Adderall in the energy drink

1520
00:56:50,740 --> 00:56:51,860
that they sell, which is dope as fuck.

1521
00:56:51,860 --> 00:56:53,820
- What are you talking about?

1522
00:56:53,820 --> 00:56:56,860
- Just thinking about drinks with things in them

1523
00:56:56,860 --> 00:56:58,220
that give you cancer.

1524
00:56:58,220 --> 00:57:00,180
- Are you ordering a drink right now?

1525
00:57:00,180 --> 00:57:01,640
- He gets what he's doing.

1526
00:57:01,640 --> 00:57:03,440
- Why did you look so focused for a moment?

1527
00:57:03,440 --> 00:57:05,940
- I had to remember what it was called.

1528
00:57:05,940 --> 00:57:07,380
- Adrifuel?

1529
00:57:07,380 --> 00:57:09,260
- Yeah, yeah, they sell,

1530
00:57:09,260 --> 00:57:12,320
have you ever heard of Modafinil?

1531
00:57:12,320 --> 00:57:15,680
- Yes, wait, Modafinil is a prescription medication.

1532
00:57:15,680 --> 00:57:18,000
- Uh-huh, so they sell an energy drink

1533
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:20,800
that metabolizes Modafinil in your liver.

1534
00:57:20,800 --> 00:57:22,400
- No way, really?

1535
00:57:22,400 --> 00:57:23,240
- Yes.

1536
00:57:23,240 --> 00:57:24,080
(laughs)

1537
00:57:24,080 --> 00:57:25,600
- Wow, that is insane.

1538
00:57:25,600 --> 00:57:29,000
Modafinil is just about the most expensive one to,

1539
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:31,320
Well, there's R-modafinil as well.

1540
00:57:31,320 --> 00:57:32,160
- Yeah.

1541
00:57:32,160 --> 00:57:34,240
- I heard Andrew Huberman talk about this shit.

1542
00:57:34,240 --> 00:57:35,240
I need to try this.

1543
00:57:35,240 --> 00:57:36,440
Adrofuel?

1544
00:57:36,440 --> 00:57:37,780
- Yes, yeah.

1545
00:57:37,780 --> 00:57:38,720
- Have you had it?

1546
00:57:38,720 --> 00:57:40,000
- No, I just got it today.

1547
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:41,120
I'm so excited.

1548
00:57:41,120 --> 00:57:44,080
- India's first sports nutrition brand built by humans.

1549
00:57:44,080 --> 00:57:45,320
- Wait, no, not that one.

1550
00:57:45,320 --> 00:57:47,040
- Are you sure?

1551
00:57:47,040 --> 00:57:48,880
A-D-R-O-F-U-E-L.

1552
00:57:48,880 --> 00:57:51,820
- No, A-D-R-A-F-U-L.

1553
00:57:51,820 --> 00:57:53,400
With an umlau on the U.

1554
00:57:53,400 --> 00:57:56,260
- Talking to regs for more than like a couple minutes

1555
00:57:56,260 --> 00:57:58,720
is really dangerous because you,

1556
00:57:58,720 --> 00:58:00,800
At the end of their talk, you will be convinced

1557
00:58:00,800 --> 00:58:03,280
that you should order something from online

1558
00:58:03,280 --> 00:58:06,760
that's usually like a drink or some sort of like just--

1559
00:58:06,760 --> 00:58:08,320
- The only thing that makes me happy

1560
00:58:08,320 --> 00:58:10,400
is pressing the button that makes money

1561
00:58:10,400 --> 00:58:12,200
go out of my account.

1562
00:58:12,200 --> 00:58:14,400
- Oh yeah, so I'm gonna be mugging you soon.

1563
00:58:14,400 --> 00:58:15,600
- Adrafinil.

1564
00:58:15,600 --> 00:58:16,440
- Yeah.

1565
00:58:16,440 --> 00:58:20,360
- 100 milligrams caffeine, 150 milligrams adrafinil.

1566
00:58:20,360 --> 00:58:23,080
- Yeah, which turns into modafinil in your liver.

1567
00:58:23,080 --> 00:58:25,080
- How do you hear about this shit, man?

1568
00:58:25,080 --> 00:58:27,040
- I saw it on Twitter,

1569
00:58:27,040 --> 00:58:29,340
and I ordered it and I got it today.

1570
00:58:29,340 --> 00:58:30,540
- And you haven't tried it?

1571
00:58:30,540 --> 00:58:33,220
- Nope, 'cause I already drank a Monster this morning

1572
00:58:33,220 --> 00:58:34,300
by the time it arrived.

1573
00:58:34,300 --> 00:58:37,500
- But tomorrow you will be giving us a trip report, yes?

1574
00:58:37,500 --> 00:58:39,060
- I will be doing it on Monday.

1575
00:58:39,060 --> 00:58:40,820
- Why Monday?

1576
00:58:40,820 --> 00:58:43,340
- No need to work that hard on a Friday.

1577
00:58:43,340 --> 00:58:45,140
- True, that's true.

1578
00:58:45,140 --> 00:58:48,260
I think you should save this review for next week

1579
00:58:48,260 --> 00:58:49,100
when we--

1580
00:58:49,100 --> 00:58:51,900
- Adraphanil was marketed in France until September 2011

1581
00:58:51,900 --> 00:58:53,620
when it was voluntarily discontinued

1582
00:58:53,620 --> 00:58:56,260
due to an unfavorable risk-benefit ratio.

1583
00:58:56,260 --> 00:58:58,520
(laughing)

1584
00:58:58,520 --> 00:59:01,260
- That's what's up, dude.

1585
00:59:01,260 --> 00:59:02,100
- Oh, God.

1586
00:59:02,100 --> 00:59:02,920
- I'm putting that shit in my body.

1587
00:59:02,920 --> 00:59:04,220
- There's a case report of two patients

1588
00:59:04,220 --> 00:59:08,980
that Adraphidil may increase interest in sex.

1589
00:59:08,980 --> 00:59:10,540
- Oh, no.

1590
00:59:10,540 --> 00:59:13,100
- This is not Adderall, this is the opposite.

1591
00:59:13,100 --> 00:59:13,980
- Yeah.

1592
00:59:13,980 --> 00:59:16,420
- This is a disgusting, disgusting drug.

1593
00:59:16,420 --> 00:59:17,300
- It's different.

1594
00:59:17,300 --> 00:59:19,700
- Not me, it makes my penis as small as a bug.

1595
00:59:19,700 --> 00:59:21,660
(burping)

1596
00:59:21,660 --> 00:59:24,700
- Makes jacking off awesome and cumming horrible.

1597
00:59:24,700 --> 00:59:27,080
- Yeah, anytime I've taken Adderall,

1598
00:59:27,080 --> 00:59:28,560
I'm always smoking cigarettes too.

1599
00:59:28,560 --> 00:59:31,100
And those are two things that shrink your penis down.

1600
00:59:31,100 --> 00:59:32,700
And then I always go to the bathroom

1601
00:59:32,700 --> 00:59:35,020
and my penis gets so small that I piss on my own pants.

1602
00:59:35,020 --> 00:59:37,280
(laughing)

1603
00:59:37,280 --> 00:59:44,100
- That's fucking dope, I do that all the time.

1604
00:59:44,100 --> 00:59:44,940
It's awesome.

1605
00:59:44,940 --> 00:59:47,660
- So I piss a literal peanut on my--

1606
00:59:47,660 --> 00:59:49,920
- Yeah, dude, it fucking looks like a dick.

1607
00:59:49,920 --> 00:59:52,280
- It's nothing, it's nothing.

1608
00:59:53,980 --> 00:59:54,820
It's just nothing.

1609
00:59:54,820 --> 00:59:56,220
- It looks like a third ball.

1610
00:59:56,220 --> 00:59:58,900
- Yeah, and it's just hitting,

1611
00:59:58,900 --> 01:00:00,780
it's hitting the side of my leg

1612
01:00:00,780 --> 01:00:02,100
'cause it's that far in.

1613
01:00:02,100 --> 01:00:04,980
- That M&M bar that's like dick so small

1614
01:00:04,980 --> 01:00:07,500
you pee on your balls used to piss me off so much.

1615
01:00:07,500 --> 01:00:08,860
I'd be like, "What's your problem, man?

1616
01:00:08,860 --> 01:00:09,700
"I bought you a piece of--"

1617
01:00:09,700 --> 01:00:11,940
(laughing)

1618
01:00:11,940 --> 01:00:16,260
- It is something that people usually don't talk about,

1619
01:00:16,260 --> 01:00:18,380
how often you can pee on yourself.

1620
01:00:18,380 --> 01:00:20,620
- I pissed on myself a couple days ago

1621
01:00:20,620 --> 01:00:21,460
while I was trying to pee,

1622
01:00:21,460 --> 01:00:23,740
but that's because my pants, I have bad pants.

1623
01:00:23,740 --> 01:00:26,100
I have a bad set of pants that I've been wearing.

1624
01:00:26,100 --> 01:00:27,940
- Explain this, explain this.

1625
01:00:27,940 --> 01:00:29,820
Explain this.

1626
01:00:29,820 --> 01:00:30,660
- I don't know.

1627
01:00:30,660 --> 01:00:33,660
I think that they just have an odd fly.

1628
01:00:33,660 --> 01:00:34,860
And so the--

1629
01:00:34,860 --> 01:00:37,140
- Oh, you just flip it out through the fly.

1630
01:00:37,140 --> 01:00:39,180
- Yeah, you pulling your pants to the ground

1631
01:00:39,180 --> 01:00:40,140
like a fucking baby?

1632
01:00:40,140 --> 01:00:40,980
What are you talking about?

1633
01:00:40,980 --> 01:00:42,640
- No, I just don't use a urinal.

1634
01:00:42,640 --> 01:00:43,700
- I don't use a urinal either.

1635
01:00:43,700 --> 01:00:45,820
I still put my dick through the fly.

1636
01:00:45,820 --> 01:00:47,420
- Oh, you need to stand up--

1637
01:00:47,420 --> 01:00:48,780
- In your house?

1638
01:00:48,780 --> 01:00:49,620
- Yeah, what?

1639
01:00:49,620 --> 01:00:50,440
Sit down.

1640
01:00:50,440 --> 01:00:51,980
- You guys sit down to pee in your own home?

1641
01:00:51,980 --> 01:00:52,980
- Sometimes.

1642
01:00:52,980 --> 01:00:56,940
- Yeah, and I'm pulling out my phone and I'm on Twitter.

1643
01:00:56,940 --> 01:00:58,780
- Y'all gay ASF.

1644
01:00:58,780 --> 01:01:02,660
- Okay, here, I'm being a third on my spot here

1645
01:01:02,660 --> 01:01:04,260
in this debate, okay?

1646
01:01:04,260 --> 01:01:05,860
Whenever-- - Okay, we're debating now.

1647
01:01:05,860 --> 01:01:08,560
- Most times when I'm standing up to pee,

1648
01:01:08,560 --> 01:01:10,860
sometimes it's in the morning or I'm not wearing my glasses

1649
01:01:10,860 --> 01:01:13,020
and it just goes everywhere in the entire room,

1650
01:01:13,020 --> 01:01:16,820
even on the roof, due to how wild the pee is.

1651
01:01:16,820 --> 01:01:20,860
When I sit down, when I sit down to pee,

1652
01:01:20,860 --> 01:01:23,300
I look, it's controlled, I can look at my phone

1653
01:01:23,300 --> 01:01:25,360
for longer than I should be in the toilet,

1654
01:01:25,360 --> 01:01:26,620
and I'm having fun.

1655
01:01:26,620 --> 01:01:28,460
- The only time I sit down to pee

1656
01:01:28,460 --> 01:01:32,460
is if I have the hardest boner of my life.

1657
01:01:32,460 --> 01:01:36,740
- Okay, so here's next week's homework, okay?

1658
01:01:36,740 --> 01:01:40,340
Rex is gonna talk to us about his weird energy drink

1659
01:01:40,340 --> 01:01:41,420
that he bought from India.

1660
01:01:41,420 --> 01:01:42,420
- Yes.

1661
01:01:42,420 --> 01:01:45,980
- And you are gonna sit down to pee today or this weekend,

1662
01:01:45,980 --> 01:01:48,580
and you're gonna talk about your experience next week.

1663
01:01:48,580 --> 01:01:51,660
I want you to, every time you sit down to pee tomorrow,

1664
01:01:51,660 --> 01:01:54,760
sit down, - Every time.

1665
01:01:54,760 --> 01:01:59,100
- Pull out your phone and just scroll for five minutes.

1666
01:01:59,100 --> 01:02:01,820
- Don't be surprised when I open this Zoom call

1667
01:02:01,820 --> 01:02:04,520
and I look like Jessica Rabbit, okay?

1668
01:02:04,520 --> 01:02:06,100
- Okay. - I would love that.

1669
01:02:06,100 --> 01:02:07,900
- I would actually really love that.

1670
01:02:07,900 --> 01:02:10,580
- Big lipstick on, blonde hair,

1671
01:02:10,580 --> 01:02:11,420
blonde hair down to my fucking knees.

1672
01:02:11,420 --> 01:02:13,340
- I would not complain about that whatsoever.

1673
01:02:13,340 --> 01:02:15,320
- All just from sitting down to pee.

1674
01:02:15,320 --> 01:02:16,160
- Okay, I'm sure that'll happen.

1675
01:02:16,160 --> 01:02:17,800
- Big, busty, double D, huge-y.

1676
01:02:17,800 --> 01:02:20,140
- Jealous of my long hair?

1677
01:02:20,140 --> 01:02:20,980
- No, I'm not jealous of your hair.

1678
01:02:20,980 --> 01:02:22,540
- From sitting down to pee?

1679
01:02:22,540 --> 01:02:25,040
- Although that's just gonna make a lot more sense.

1680
01:02:25,040 --> 01:02:27,020
- All the extra gravity from sitting down to pee?

1681
01:02:27,020 --> 01:02:30,260
- All the extra grip that somebody can use

1682
01:02:30,260 --> 01:02:32,860
as they plow you, that's what that hair is for, I know.

1683
01:02:32,860 --> 01:02:35,320
- The only downside-- - Now my hole is open.

1684
01:02:35,320 --> 01:02:38,620
I'm giving myself hemorrhoids reading my phone so long.

1685
01:02:38,620 --> 01:02:39,900
(laughing)

1686
01:02:39,900 --> 01:02:42,140
- Yeah, the only downside to this is that you might

1687
01:02:42,140 --> 01:02:44,380
have a mirror in front of your toilet,

1688
01:02:44,380 --> 01:02:47,380
you might get a B-Reel notification

1689
01:02:47,380 --> 01:02:49,420
at the exact moment when you're peeing.

1690
01:02:49,420 --> 01:02:50,980
- I'm not kidding.

1691
01:02:50,980 --> 01:02:54,240
Three times a week, I get a B-Reel when I'm shitting.

1692
01:02:54,240 --> 01:02:56,900
- That just means you spend too much time on the toilet.

1693
01:02:56,900 --> 01:02:57,740
That is crazy.

1694
01:02:57,740 --> 01:02:59,700
The odds of that happening are just--

1695
01:02:59,700 --> 01:03:02,100
- I think I'm just that unlucky.

1696
01:03:02,100 --> 01:03:04,300
It's like, I don't even shit for days,

1697
01:03:04,300 --> 01:03:06,420
and I'll sit down, and I'll--

1698
01:03:06,420 --> 01:03:07,620
- You don't shit for days?

1699
01:03:07,620 --> 01:03:08,460
- What?

1700
01:03:08,460 --> 01:03:11,100
Yeah, do you shit every day?

1701
01:03:11,100 --> 01:03:13,020
- Shit at least twice a day.

1702
01:03:13,020 --> 01:03:16,020
I shit twice today, but yesterday I didn't shit at all.

1703
01:03:16,020 --> 01:03:17,820
Every morning and every night.

1704
01:03:17,820 --> 01:03:20,900
But sometimes I'll just sit down and I'll just

1705
01:03:20,900 --> 01:03:22,860
hear the B-Reel sound.

1706
01:03:22,860 --> 01:03:24,620
And I'm like, what am I supposed to do here?

1707
01:03:24,620 --> 01:03:27,800
Because of the time that I took a B-Reel while shitting,

1708
01:03:27,800 --> 01:03:29,980
forgetting that my mirror is directly

1709
01:03:29,980 --> 01:03:33,700
in front of the toilet, and almost by accident

1710
01:03:33,700 --> 01:03:34,860
covered up my penis.

1711
01:03:34,860 --> 01:03:36,860
Otherwise, it would have been fully on my B-Reel.

1712
01:03:36,860 --> 01:03:38,700
I mean, honestly, Rex, I hate to be

1713
01:03:38,700 --> 01:03:39,820
the one to break this news.

1714
01:03:39,820 --> 01:03:41,620
You live in the third dimension.

1715
01:03:41,620 --> 01:03:47,300
and you can move your phone so that you can face two different, like, you know,

1716
01:03:47,300 --> 01:03:49,720
I get that there's the, the,

1717
01:03:49,720 --> 01:03:51,740
No, it takes it on both sides.

1718
01:03:51,740 --> 01:03:52,600
Yeah, I know.

1719
01:03:52,600 --> 01:03:56,220
So turn your head to the left, take a picture of your shower and a picture of

1720
01:03:56,220 --> 01:03:56,620
your face.

1721
01:03:56,620 --> 01:03:59,020
Well, I, I, here's what I did, right.

1722
01:03:59,020 --> 01:04:04,320
Was I was going to take the forward, the back camera, realizing that there's a big

1723
01:04:04,320 --> 01:04:06,140
mirror directly in front of the toilet.

1724
01:04:06,140 --> 01:04:07,900
Went, well, I can't do that.

1725
01:04:07,920 --> 01:04:11,680
So I just turned the camera around to take a selfie,

1726
01:04:11,680 --> 01:04:14,200
forgetting that it also uses the other camera.

1727
01:04:14,200 --> 01:04:18,520
- Yeah, you need to add your fuel so, so badly.

1728
01:04:18,520 --> 01:04:21,400
- Wait, hang on.

1729
01:04:21,400 --> 01:04:23,880
I got a subsequent question.

1730
01:04:23,880 --> 01:04:28,000
What happened to the thinking pills?

1731
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:29,920
The serene, the--

1732
01:04:29,920 --> 01:04:32,000
- Oh, theory or whatever they're called?

1733
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:33,040
- The theory pills, yeah.

1734
01:04:33,040 --> 01:04:34,240
What happened to those?

1735
01:04:34,240 --> 01:04:37,160
- They're sitting in a stack over there.

1736
01:04:37,160 --> 01:04:39,200
- Did you stop taking them?

1737
01:04:39,200 --> 01:04:40,840
- They made me shit too much.

1738
01:04:40,840 --> 01:04:43,600
- More than once a week.

1739
01:04:43,600 --> 01:04:46,120
- I'm trying to be backed up.

1740
01:04:46,120 --> 01:04:47,960
I'm time maxing, dude.

1741
01:04:47,960 --> 01:04:48,800
- Yeah.

1742
01:04:48,800 --> 01:04:50,600
- I'm trying to keep my time out of the bathroom

1743
01:04:50,600 --> 01:04:51,440
and on the computer.

1744
01:04:51,440 --> 01:04:52,800
- See, shitting for me is probably,

1745
01:04:52,800 --> 01:04:53,640
and this is profound,

1746
01:04:53,640 --> 01:04:55,760
probably what pissing is for you.

1747
01:04:55,760 --> 01:04:58,180
- Yes, that is true.

1748
01:04:58,180 --> 01:05:00,400
An enjoyable experience.

1749
01:05:00,400 --> 01:05:02,160
- I enjoy every single shit I have.

1750
01:05:02,160 --> 01:05:03,280
It's my moment of solitude.

1751
01:05:03,280 --> 01:05:04,480
- Shitting hurts for me.

1752
01:05:04,480 --> 01:05:05,840
My ass hurts.

1753
01:05:05,840 --> 01:05:08,120
- My ass hurts all day and night, you motherfucker.

1754
01:05:08,120 --> 01:05:09,740
- I'm bleeding, okay?

1755
01:05:09,740 --> 01:05:12,280
- Your asshole's bleeding?

1756
01:05:12,280 --> 01:05:13,500
- Every time.

1757
01:05:13,500 --> 01:05:14,340
And it hurts.

1758
01:05:14,340 --> 01:05:15,320
- You bleed every time?

1759
01:05:15,320 --> 01:05:16,400
- I think that's bad.

1760
01:05:16,400 --> 01:05:19,000
- And then I'm blasting it with water after,

1761
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:21,680
waiting for blood to stop flowing out.

1762
01:05:21,680 --> 01:05:24,200
- That's probably why you're probably going maximum speed

1763
01:05:24,200 --> 01:05:26,200
on the, you're reaching terminal velocity

1764
01:05:26,200 --> 01:05:28,080
with the water blasting into your ass

1765
01:05:28,080 --> 01:05:30,600
and it's ripping it apart like a pressure washer.

1766
01:05:30,600 --> 01:05:31,720
- No, it feels good.

1767
01:05:31,720 --> 01:05:32,560
- Oh, okay.

1768
01:05:32,560 --> 01:05:34,800
- Dude, you know what sucks with the bidet?

1769
01:05:34,800 --> 01:05:37,360
It was so hot here last week that when I--

1770
01:05:37,360 --> 01:05:39,960
- That you splattered it in your face.

1771
01:05:39,960 --> 01:05:42,520
- No, that when I was using the bidet,

1772
01:05:42,520 --> 01:05:45,840
the water was hot and it felt weird in my butt.

1773
01:05:45,840 --> 01:05:48,040
- Yeah, I like the cold, it's refreshing.

1774
01:05:48,040 --> 01:05:48,880
- I do like it when it's cold.

1775
01:05:48,880 --> 01:05:51,700
- It's like a good cutoff for taking a shit.

1776
01:05:51,700 --> 01:05:54,260
One quick wipe and you're out.

1777
01:05:54,260 --> 01:05:55,800
- You guys gotta stop with this bidet stuff.

1778
01:05:55,800 --> 01:05:57,400
I barely use toilet paper.

1779
01:05:57,400 --> 01:05:58,240
I'm not gonna use it.

1780
01:05:58,240 --> 01:05:59,080
- You need to get one. - I probably use

1781
01:05:59,080 --> 01:06:00,800
less toilet paper than you because I have a--

1782
01:06:00,800 --> 01:06:02,120
- You need to get one.

1783
01:06:02,120 --> 01:06:03,840
- I don't even want, I don't want to--

1784
01:06:03,840 --> 01:06:05,280
- You have a dirty butt.

1785
01:06:05,280 --> 01:06:06,640
You have a dirty butt.

1786
01:06:06,640 --> 01:06:07,880
- Oh yeah, I do.

1787
01:06:07,880 --> 01:06:09,320
'Cause I'm a grown man.

1788
01:06:09,320 --> 01:06:10,760
And if you're a grown man,

1789
01:06:10,760 --> 01:06:15,600
your ass should be disgusting and fucking green.

1790
01:06:15,600 --> 01:06:16,960
That's what your ass should be.

1791
01:06:16,960 --> 01:06:18,320
- No, we're done here.

1792
01:06:18,320 --> 01:06:21,360
- No, you should have flies flying around your ass

1793
01:06:21,360 --> 01:06:22,520
at all times.

1794
01:06:22,520 --> 01:06:25,480
- I'm shitting out undigested salad and blood

1795
01:06:25,480 --> 01:06:27,280
and it's wiping that shit straight off the earth.

1796
01:06:27,280 --> 01:06:29,160
- How is this the podcast?

1797
01:06:29,160 --> 01:06:31,320
(laughing)

1798
01:06:31,320 --> 01:06:32,160
- Oh wait, the beer.

1799
01:06:32,160 --> 01:06:33,520
The beer was good.

1800
01:06:33,520 --> 01:06:34,360
Yummy.

1801
01:06:34,360 --> 01:06:36,080
I like the beer.

1802
01:06:36,080 --> 01:06:37,000
All right, bye.

1803
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:38,560
Bye.
