1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,580
(upbeat music)

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:10,600
- And away we go.

3
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:13,400
- For another legendary installment of Podcasts About Love.

4
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:14,480
- That's right.

5
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:16,600
- This time with a twist.

6
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:17,600
- We're all talking low voices.

7
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:22,600
- This time with a low twist.

8
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:25,360
- This time we're all gonna mumble and murmur.

9
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:26,640
- I do think that.

10
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:28,920
- It's called mumblecore podcast.

11
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:30,800
It's a mobile core podcast.

12
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:32,300
And it's different from movies,

13
00:00:32,300 --> 00:00:34,160
'cause movies, mobile core is different.

14
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:36,040
Nobody, you know, I'm sorry.

15
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:38,200
You have to keep your voice down today.

16
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:40,480
You sound like Buffalo Bill.

17
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:43,240
You have to keep your voice down today.

18
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:45,280
Patrick sounds a lot like Buffalo Bill.

19
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:47,240
You have to keep your voice down today

20
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:49,880
or else it gets the hose again.

21
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:51,480
Well, now he really does,

22
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:52,640
'cause he said one of the lines from--

23
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:53,480
Reference Thursday, y'all.

24
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:55,080
I said that it's Reference Thursday.

25
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:56,360
Reference Thursday, y'all.

26
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:57,560
It is not Reference Thursday, all right?

27
00:00:57,560 --> 00:00:59,280
- It is not Reference Thursday.

28
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:01,240
- That's no moon.

29
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:02,560
- Wait, what's that from?

30
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:03,400
- I don't know.

31
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:04,520
- Star Wars.

32
00:01:04,520 --> 00:01:05,680
- Oh shit.

33
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:07,320
- Say any reference, I bet I'd get it.

34
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:08,160
(laughing)

35
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:09,000
- Okay, I like this game.

36
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:09,840
- Okay, yeah, here we go.

37
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:12,120
- I like this game.

38
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:12,960
- By God!

39
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:15,000
- Britain.

40
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:15,840
- Fuck.

41
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:17,720
(laughing)

42
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:18,560
- England.

43
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:20,920
- Fuck, now I'm trying to think of one

44
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:22,120
that will really stump him.

45
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:24,880
- I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready.

46
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:27,040
- Die, die, die, die. - SpongeBob.

47
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:28,240
- Aye, aye, aye, aye.

48
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:29,400
- SpongeBob.

49
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:32,000
- I thought you wouldn't expect two SpongeBobs in a row.

50
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,880
- Squidward from SpongeBob.

51
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:38,400
- Three, you really, you guessed three in a row?

52
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:41,160
That's like, how did we not fool him with the third one?

53
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:42,000
You know?

54
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:42,820
- I know.

55
00:01:42,820 --> 00:01:44,560
- Ar, ar, ar, SpongeBob me boy.

56
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:45,680
- Plankton's enemy.

57
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:46,680
- You said Plankton.

58
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:47,520
- You did say Plankton.

59
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:49,120
- You're destroyed.

60
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:50,440
- Yeah, Plankton's enemy.

61
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:51,280
- No, okay, okay.

62
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:52,840
- Ar, ar, ar, and you thought it was Plankton.

63
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:54,240
- All right, Plankton's enemy, Cribs.

64
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:55,060
- All right.

65
00:01:55,060 --> 00:01:55,900
- Reference Thursday.

66
00:01:55,900 --> 00:01:57,280
- I was gonna say, another reference

67
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:59,080
that we can trick you with.

68
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:00,820
- Okay, trick me?

69
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:01,660
- Yeah.

70
00:02:01,660 --> 00:02:03,120
- Stump the reference head.

71
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:04,820
- No, this is Patrick.

72
00:02:04,820 --> 00:02:07,440
- Me, that's my, be on the phone.

73
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:08,280
- We got him.

74
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:09,100
- We got him.

75
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:10,360
- Be on the phone with my nephew.

76
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:12,240
'Cause he calls me, ever since he learned that,

77
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:14,280
he calls me every day and says that.

78
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:15,120
- Every day?

79
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:16,200
- No, pretty much, there was a week

80
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:18,080
where he called me every day and said that.

81
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:20,360
- He said, he would call you and say, no, this is Patrick?

82
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:22,460
- He would say, is this the Krusty Krab?

83
00:02:22,460 --> 00:02:23,560
- And you would say what?

84
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:25,520
- I would just hang up the phone on him.

85
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:28,080
- Dude, the way that you describe having a nephew

86
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:29,760
makes it sound so terrible.

87
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:30,720
- Yeah.

88
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:33,640
- It's just a huge emotional burden.

89
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:34,920
- It's not even your son.

90
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:35,760
You can't even-- - You don't even get the reward.

91
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:37,800
- You wouldn't even be able to handle it.

92
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:39,520
- You have to be, to somebody,

93
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:41,120
there's somebody in the world, a child,

94
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:42,400
that you have to be as an uncle,

95
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:44,280
you have to be the number one coolest guy

96
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:45,120
in their entire life.

97
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:45,940
- Yeah.

98
00:02:45,940 --> 00:02:46,920
- Until they're like seven years old.

99
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:47,980
- I have the cheat code though,

100
00:02:47,980 --> 00:02:50,480
you just move away really far.

101
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:51,840
- I have the cheat code,

102
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:53,520
'cause it's what I do to my little nephews.

103
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:54,800
- You don't have a nephew.

104
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:57,980
- I'd have them by marriage.

105
00:02:57,980 --> 00:02:58,820
- No.

106
00:02:58,820 --> 00:02:59,860
- Yeah, I do, so.

107
00:02:59,860 --> 00:03:00,960
- No, you don't.

108
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:01,920
That would be your cousin.

109
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:03,300
- And they don't like me.

110
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:04,240
- That would be your cousins,

111
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:05,360
and your cousins don't like you.

112
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:07,240
- They don't like me, they don't know my name.

113
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:08,080
- Probably 'cause they--

114
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:08,900
- They don't know your name.

115
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:09,740
- Probably 'cause you hit them with BB guns.

116
00:03:09,740 --> 00:03:11,400
- My nephews don't really know my name.

117
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:12,240
- Don't really or they don't?

118
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:13,060
- They sometimes--

119
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:14,160
- They don't exist, how are they gonna know his name?

120
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:16,480
- Well, I say don't really because I took the average,

121
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:18,360
but there's three of 'em.

122
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:19,240
Or no, there's two of 'em,

123
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:21,240
and one doesn't know my name, and one--

124
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:23,080
- No, there's three. - He's making it up as he goes.

125
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:25,140
- No, there is three, and a niece,

126
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:26,760
but one of them doesn't know my name.

127
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:29,200
- New details to the story of the compulsive liar.

128
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:30,820
- You are behaving like--

129
00:03:30,820 --> 00:03:33,600
- See, and I don't remember even how many of them there are.

130
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:35,600
- That's true, I guess you wouldn't admit

131
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:37,440
you were unsure if you were lying.

132
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:39,760
- Yeah, why would they know my name?

133
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:41,360
- 'Cause they don't exist.

134
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:43,160
- They do exist. - They don't exist.

135
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:45,520
Cameron, look at me, they don't exist.

136
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:46,360
- Okay.

137
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:48,840
- My Uncle Michael was pretty cool to me growing up.

138
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:50,440
- That's not your nephew, though.

139
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:52,320
- That's your Uncle Michael.

140
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:54,120
- I didn't say that was my nephew.

141
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:58,400
My Uncle Michael, he has a dope ass scar on his neck

142
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:00,000
because of cancer.

143
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,680
And he looks amazing.

144
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:02,760
- I've seen a few guys with scars

145
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:04,800
over the past few months on the street.

146
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:07,120
- Have you been hanging out in lion's dens?

147
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:08,280
- What's, oh no.

148
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:09,120
- No, what's that?

149
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:10,720
- That one right there.

150
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:12,000
- Yeah, I haven't seen that one.

151
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,040
- I cannot believe that you still have that scar.

152
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:17,000
- I've seen a lot of guys with scars on their faces and necks.

153
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:17,840
- Scary.

154
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:18,680
- Isn't that cool and crazy?

155
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:19,520
- Biker status.

156
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:21,680
- And it's, you wanna look at them.

157
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:23,480
- Well you've been hanging out at the veterans hall.

158
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:25,480
- You're too afraid to look at them.

159
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:28,000
- Speaking of afraid, I'm gonna crack this open, sorry.

160
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,280
I'm gonna crack open my psychedelic water.

161
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:31,400
Oh, it's squirted.

162
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:32,240
- It's squirted onto the table.

163
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:33,960
- Okay, so this has something in it.

164
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:37,720
This struck my attention and caught my eye at the--

165
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:39,920
- And I'm seeing the price tag on it.

166
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:40,760
- I know the tag.

167
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:41,580
- And it says Urban Outfitters.

168
00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:43,320
(laughing)

169
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:44,640
- I noticed that too.

170
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:47,560
- Urban Outfitters, $6, oh that's Canadian.

171
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:49,480
- I did not buy this from an Urban Outfitters.

172
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:56,840
So whoever got this at the deli, they got it from, it didn't sell at an Urban Outfitters,

173
00:04:56,840 --> 00:05:04,240
so they shipped it off to Organic R Us on Myrtle Avenue, and I grabbed this there. And this

174
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:08,560
is the Prickly Pear flavor, and I saw a lot of reviews for this. I looked them up.

175
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:09,600
So what is it?

176
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:12,600
You looked up reviews before picking it up and drinking it?

177
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:17,600
Yeah, I always watch a review before I listen to an album. Not the true drink reviewer.

178
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:20,680
Well, the taste doesn't matter because I'm trying to go on a trip.

179
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:22,680
No, you go completely blind into something.

180
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:23,680
Okay, but what is it though? Is it...

181
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:25,680
It's kava, which I've never had before.

182
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:26,680
What's that?

183
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:29,680
Kava is some kind of... It's like kratom, kind of.

184
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:31,680
It's like kratom, but in liquid.

185
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:32,680
Oh.

186
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:34,680
Yeah, that does not taste very good.

187
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:35,680
I'm not gonna...

188
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:36,680
It tastes like...

189
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:37,680
I'm already really hungover.

190
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:40,680
It tastes like toothpaste. Well, I think that this might...

191
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:41,680
Ooh, now I want to taste it.

192
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:42,680
I think this might help.

193
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:43,680
(laughter)

194
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:44,680
Now I want some.

195
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:45,520
I want some.

196
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:46,480
- Well, here's a warning.

197
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:47,320
- Okay.

198
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:48,360
- This product is not for children,

199
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:49,640
pregnant or nursing women,

200
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:52,280
or persons sensitive to caffeine.

201
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:55,760
US FDA advises that a potential risk

202
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:58,600
of rare but severe liver injury

203
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:01,960
may be associated with kava-containing dietary supplements.

204
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:02,800
- Wow.

205
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:04,720
- A liver injury?

206
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:06,440
Please do not operate heavy equipment

207
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:08,280
after using psychedelic water.

208
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:09,880
- Yeah, you gotta put that microphone down

209
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:11,300
for the rest of the episode.

210
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:12,280
- This is not heavy.

211
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:13,720
Maybe to a wimp or an ant.

212
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:15,520
You are a wimp.

213
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:16,080
No.

214
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:19,120
You're drinking a shiny can.

215
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:20,920
The can is pretty.

216
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:21,720
Wait.

217
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:22,760
Holy shit.

218
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:26,080
Made in USA with globally sourced ingredients and rituals.

219
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:27,080
Rituals?

220
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:28,680
They use a ritual on this.

221
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:29,180
OK.

222
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:30,200
That's not OK.

223
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:33,120
I think it's like a ritualistic thing.

224
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:34,080
What does that mean?

225
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:39,240
That means you drink it with two of your buddies on a podcast.

226
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:41,240
There are kava bars, which I didn't really--

227
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:43,160
There's one next to my old apartment.

228
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:44,760
- I learned though. - Is it a seed or a leaf

229
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:46,820
or a mushroom or a root? - It's a root, I believe.

230
00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:48,600
I believe it's a root that,

231
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:50,480
right now it makes my tongue taste bad.

232
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:53,000
- There's two kava bars next to my old apartment.

233
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:53,840
- They have a full bar?

234
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:54,840
I've never heard of this thing - And I wonder if I'm a gentrifier.

235
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:57,120
- And now they're making a whole industry out of it.

236
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:58,160
- Yeah. - They're trying to do it

237
00:06:58,160 --> 00:06:59,000
behind my back.

238
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,000
- Well, it's for people who are addicted to beer.

239
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,600
- Oh, okay. - Is that true?

240
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:05,360
- Yeah, it's kinda like beer, but for,

241
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:06,720
it's like Kratom for beer. - I thought that was

242
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:08,640
what water was for. - No.

243
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:10,800
- Wait, I thought that this is gonna make me

244
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:16,900
Fucking go crazy and kill somebody. Oh, oh fuck this man. It's like kratom for beer

245
00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:24,640
I'm gonna polish it off. Okay, cuz what's the worst I get out of that can looks polished enough look at that sheen

246
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:28,640
It does look it looks like a holographic trading card. Yeah

247
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:32,620
I think you could probably fetch a lot of money with that at a comic book store if you

248
00:07:32,620 --> 00:07:36,380
Just watch catch me if you can that's such a good movie

249
00:07:36,380 --> 00:07:39,500
I would do this to young Leonardo DiCaprio's penis.

250
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:41,100
I would make it look this shiny.

251
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:42,420
Oh, from greasing it?

252
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:43,420
Yeah.

253
00:07:43,420 --> 00:07:44,420
He's 16 in that movie.

254
00:07:44,420 --> 00:07:45,420
Shut up.

255
00:07:45,420 --> 00:07:46,420
He's 16.

256
00:07:46,420 --> 00:07:47,420
That's a little taste of his own medicine.

257
00:07:47,420 --> 00:07:48,420
I don't know if you guys are going to see what he's been up to.

258
00:07:48,420 --> 00:07:52,540
He said he's going to polish a 16-year-old boy's penis.

259
00:07:52,540 --> 00:07:53,540
That's right.

260
00:07:53,540 --> 00:07:54,540
It would be a little, that's what I'd say.

261
00:07:54,540 --> 00:07:55,540
Yeah.

262
00:07:55,540 --> 00:07:56,540
So hey, little Leo.

263
00:07:56,540 --> 00:08:01,180
You're going to do some stuff in the future.

264
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:03,620
I'm going to do this to your cock.

265
00:08:03,620 --> 00:08:06,800
- We go back in time and cause him to date a 16 year old.

266
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:09,340
- No, if I could go teach him a lesson,

267
00:08:09,340 --> 00:08:12,900
I would bring him, I'm not gonna molest him, first of all.

268
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:13,740
- You said that.

269
00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:16,260
- You said you would molest a 16 year old boy.

270
00:08:16,260 --> 00:08:17,700
- That is not what I said at all.

271
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:19,780
- That's what you said you would molest a 16 year old.

272
00:08:19,780 --> 00:08:21,180
- You're fucking tripping off that shit,

273
00:08:21,180 --> 00:08:22,220
'cause you said that.

274
00:08:22,220 --> 00:08:23,060
- Am I crazy?

275
00:08:23,060 --> 00:08:26,340
Am I losing my mind off of Kavah?

276
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:31,180
Yeah, I just thought about, you know the guy,

277
00:08:31,180 --> 00:08:33,840
What's the name of the guy from Vice that does drugs?

278
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:35,160
- Hamilton's Pharmacopia.

279
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:37,000
- Yeah, that guy probably would call it Kvah.

280
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:37,920
- That's not his last name.

281
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:39,560
His last name isn't Pharmacopia.

282
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:41,800
(laughing)

283
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:46,360
- No, he was not 16 in Catch Me If You Can.

284
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:49,560
That's not a fuckin' 32 year old movie.

285
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:51,140
- That's 32 years old.

286
00:08:51,140 --> 00:08:56,180
- He was 31.

287
00:08:56,180 --> 00:08:57,960
- You caught me 'cause he could.

288
00:08:57,960 --> 00:09:00,800
- Scroll down, it says he was 21 at the time of filming.

289
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:01,800
time of filming?

290
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:03,480
Twenty-eight.

291
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:04,920
But the other...

292
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:06,980
So I think basically what we can take

293
00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:08,160
from this is there's no...

294
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:09,080
Nobody knows.

295
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:10,520
He's fucking older than I am, man.

296
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:12,280
That's true.

297
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:14,400
Wait, you blew my mind with that.

298
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:15,420
Damn.

299
00:09:15,420 --> 00:09:16,840
I thought we were all the same age as

300
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:17,260
him.

301
00:09:17,260 --> 00:09:19,120
No, as of the movies that he's in.

302
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:20,560
But I would basically do...

303
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:22,840
His cock would look very,

304
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:23,840
very...

305
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:25,760
Spit shine it, you know, you could see

306
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:27,680
your own reflection in it, you know,

307
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:28,760
like a Maserati.

308
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:30,160
Yeah.

309
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:31,760
Why would you do that though?

310
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:34,760
Why would I suck his cock and fucking blend it with my butt?

311
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:35,260
Yeah.

312
00:09:35,260 --> 00:09:36,260
Just for a laugh.

313
00:09:36,260 --> 00:09:37,760
His attractiveness or...

314
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:40,560
Yeah, his attractiveness. He looks so hot in that movie. Look at him.

315
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:42,160
Frank Abagnale Jr.

316
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:46,260
He said he wants to have sex with a 16 year old Leonardo DiCaprio.

317
00:09:46,260 --> 00:09:48,260
He's not 16, man!

318
00:09:48,260 --> 00:09:49,260
He said it.

319
00:09:49,260 --> 00:09:50,260
I didn't...

320
00:09:50,260 --> 00:09:52,260
He said it. It's on the record.

321
00:09:52,260 --> 00:09:53,260
It is on the record.

322
00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:54,260
We don't mind.

323
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:55,760
He wants to polish that thing off.

324
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:59,760
If you want to polish a 16 year old Leo's pole, we're not going to be mad at you.

325
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:05,920
That's for I say yes or no to that. Will you Juvia? Will you please look up a picture of 16 year old Leonardo DiCaprio?

326
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:11,920
You want him and what's eating Gilbert grape don't you let me just see I just have to look

327
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:16,480
Just to see oh no he looks like a fucking dork

328
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:22,400
He looks like shit, I wouldn't fucking suck kids

329
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:29,440
That's terrible. I definitely tell you what if I did it wouldn't be this good. It wouldn't look like this

330
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:33,660
No, yeah, I'd turn all blank if I did it like OJ

331
00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:43,460
No listen

332
00:10:43,460 --> 00:10:48,120
He was a late bloomer right by the time. I was 16. I looked like fucking I looked amazing

333
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:50,880
God, I looked so good at 16

334
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:54,940
So I just basically polished off my kava drink

335
00:10:57,840 --> 00:11:04,340
Okay, hold on sorry. I'm treating you so poorly so curious about it. I know it's something so poorly camera today guys

336
00:11:04,340 --> 00:11:07,160
I think I'm entering into a psychedelic state yeah

337
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:13,100
spiders spiders spiders blah blah bleep bleep bleep guys are gonna have a bad trip

338
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:20,180
We're gonna trip off soda though, but yeah the world isn't floating around in space

339
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:23,920
It isn't you're breathing manually now, and you're blinking

340
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:30,800
That's me breathing manually. That's how good I am at breathing. Mm-hmm. I'm stick shifting and I'm dry

341
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:33,460
Statements have not been evaluated by the Food and Drug Administration

342
00:11:33,460 --> 00:11:35,980
I don't give a fuck about what the Food and Drug Administration

343
00:11:35,980 --> 00:11:41,780
They're wrong most of the time food and drug administration is blocking the cure for cancer

344
00:11:41,780 --> 00:11:44,480
Yeah, that's what I've heard too that I heard a face

345
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:44,820
Yeah

346
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:50,180
There's a food that cures cancer that they've been saying you can only it's peach pits you have to put nutrition facts on this food

347
00:11:50,180 --> 00:11:55,620
Or you can't release it. Uh-huh. Am I gonna spit its peach if they eat 16 peach bits 16 peach pits

348
00:11:55,620 --> 00:12:02,300
Uh-huh guys am I gonna be like this forever yeah, this is you were gonna be like this for the rest of your life

349
00:12:02,300 --> 00:12:05,780
I will say which is gonna be short cuz you're going to die I

350
00:12:05,780 --> 00:12:09,940
Honestly, I've already I'm having an ego death, and I'm in right in the middle of you're gonna

351
00:12:09,940 --> 00:12:13,840
Have a real death because you drink too much of that. There's no difference between any

352
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:17,380
OD'd on this and I'm not even my

353
00:12:17,380 --> 00:12:24,300
Don't touch them like that that was realistic AF

354
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:28,300
I'm still at home on my phone in my bed.

355
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:29,300
Me too.

356
00:12:29,300 --> 00:12:32,300
I have five hours of screen time.

357
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:35,300
That's what we did right before we started recording.

358
00:12:35,300 --> 00:12:38,300
We found out it's about 12.30, 12.45.

359
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:39,300
It was 12.30.

360
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:46,300
It was 12.30 and at 12.30 he said that he woke up at 7 and we looked at his screen time on his phone

361
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:48,300
and he had been on his phone for five and a half hours.

362
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:50,300
I was watching a lot of videos.

363
00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:57,300
I'm so hungover, it's the only thing that you can do when you're hungover.

364
00:12:57,300 --> 00:12:59,800
I'm also usually trying to train my brain.

365
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:02,260
I did not drink at all.

366
00:13:02,260 --> 00:13:03,260
That's COVID, bud.

367
00:13:03,260 --> 00:13:04,700
No, I had too much fun.

368
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:05,700
That's what I've been saying.

369
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:06,700
You can't overdose on fun.

370
00:13:06,700 --> 00:13:07,700
You cannot overdose on fun.

371
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:11,020
I didn't overdose on fun because I'd be fucking dead.

372
00:13:11,020 --> 00:13:14,360
You don't just instinctively die when you overdose.

373
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:16,700
You guys would throw me in a fucking dumpster if I overdosed.

374
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:18,360
You would leave me for dead.

375
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:19,360
We would.

376
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:20,680
- Why? 'Cause you're too tall.

377
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:23,480
- You would see drool spitting out of the corner of my mouth.

378
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:25,080
You would see a party hat on my head

379
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:27,320
and a blower in my mouth.

380
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:28,160
- A blower?

381
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:29,000
- And you'd throw me the shredder.

382
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,520
- You would put a gun in your mouth?

383
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:32,600
- Yeah, and you wouldn't care.

384
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:33,640
- Guys.

385
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:36,080
- I would fucking care if you put a gun in your mouth.

386
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:36,920
- No.

387
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:37,740
- Guys, I have bad news.

388
00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:38,580
- It's expired?

389
00:13:38,580 --> 00:13:39,620
- I ate the brown acid.

390
00:13:39,620 --> 00:13:41,480
- It's expired?

391
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:42,680
- It's expired.

392
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:43,520
- It's expired by how much?

393
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:44,440
- That means it's not gonna do it.

394
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:46,360
It means you're gonna throw up maybe.

395
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:48,200
- Don't put that into my brain right now, dude.

396
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:49,120
- You're gonna throw up from it.

397
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:50,080
- No, dude, I'm high. - Yeah, your stomach

398
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:51,720
might start gurgling.

399
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:52,840
- I'm hot.

400
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:54,560
I got cotton mouth like a motherfucker.

401
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:55,400
- Oh, shit.

402
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:57,080
(laughing)

403
00:13:57,080 --> 00:13:59,160
You should have picked up some Doritos.

404
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:00,320
- I really shouldn't have.

405
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:02,080
I should have picked up 14 more of these

406
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:03,880
'cause I think I have a permanent addiction.

407
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:04,720
- Yeah.

408
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:06,400
- Yeah, and I can barely even speak right now

409
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:08,000
because you guys are both turning

410
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,560
into giant fucking versions of my parents.

411
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:12,600
- No. - Clean your room!

412
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:14,880
- No.

413
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:16,120
- That's what your mom sounds like.

414
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:17,080
- Clean your room now!

415
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:17,920
- She does sound a little bit like that.

416
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:22,920
Caleb right now is having an acid fucking realization

417
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:24,500
that he does.

418
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:25,320
He's having acid flashbacks.

419
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:26,160
He's having, what's it called when you realize,

420
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:28,720
epiphany, that he doesn't have to clean his room

421
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:29,840
when his parents say so.

422
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:32,440
I would love to have an acid flashback.

423
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:33,280
He's in space.

424
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:35,520
Every time I've done acid I've just watched movies.

425
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:37,400
I've just watched, I watched Awesome Powers

426
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:39,640
and then I watched the SpongeBob movie.

427
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:42,560
So if I had an acid flashback I'd probably just laugh.

428
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:43,400
We watch Goldmember.

429
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:45,320
I do, I keep having TV flashbacks.

430
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:47,240
Or I watch an episode of TV and a few weeks later

431
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:48,840
I remember a moment from it.

432
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:50,760
- And it hits you like a freight train.

433
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:52,400
- If it's a funny moment, I'll giggle.

434
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:55,640
- I had an acid flashback that I used to work

435
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:58,360
at a pizza place and then my dog waited for me

436
00:14:58,360 --> 00:15:01,800
outside of the pizza place for 1,000 years.

437
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:02,880
- Dumbass dog.

438
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:03,720
- Yeah.

439
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:04,540
- Dumbass dog.

440
00:15:04,540 --> 00:15:05,380
- That was an acid flashback I had.

441
00:15:05,380 --> 00:15:06,220
- Damn.

442
00:15:06,220 --> 00:15:07,040
- And Zoidberg was there.

443
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:08,160
- Zoidberg was there?

444
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:09,000
- Yeah.

445
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,280
- Yeah, I've had a lot of, I had an acid flashback

446
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:14,160
about Mr. Burns, he got fucking shot

447
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:15,000
and I'm trying to figure it out.

448
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:15,820
- Whoa.

449
00:15:15,820 --> 00:15:19,100
We'll just wait for your next flashback to find out who did it.

450
00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:21,820
I have a feeling it's going to be a big surprise.

451
00:15:21,820 --> 00:15:22,820
Whoever it is.

452
00:15:22,820 --> 00:15:23,820
Whatever adult did it.

453
00:15:23,820 --> 00:15:26,940
If only I could have fucking bet on that shit.

454
00:15:26,940 --> 00:15:28,220
Dude, I, oh my god.

455
00:15:28,220 --> 00:15:30,220
Do you ever have, I just had.

456
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:31,220
Back in the day.

457
00:15:31,220 --> 00:15:32,700
Bet, bet, bet, bet, bet, bet, bet, bet, bet, bet, bet.

458
00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:34,980
Did people bet on who shot Mr. Burns?

459
00:15:34,980 --> 00:15:35,980
Yeah.

460
00:15:35,980 --> 00:15:36,980
They did?

461
00:15:36,980 --> 00:15:37,980
Yeah.

462
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:38,980
Yeah, definitely.

463
00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:39,980
DraftKings.

464
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:40,980
Yeah.

465
00:15:40,980 --> 00:15:41,980
This is, this is.

466
00:15:41,980 --> 00:15:42,980
That's DraftKings first big game.

467
00:15:42,980 --> 00:15:43,980
Pull up the odds.

468
00:15:43,980 --> 00:15:44,980
They had, they had, I saw the odds of it.

469
00:15:44,980 --> 00:15:48,120
- Homer was a favorite with two to one odds.

470
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:49,540
Who the fuck would bet Homer, bro?

471
00:15:49,540 --> 00:15:50,380
- Here it is.

472
00:15:50,380 --> 00:15:51,780
- Whoa. - This is in the Mirage?

473
00:15:51,780 --> 00:15:52,700
- Damn.

474
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:53,540
- Did they even have-- - That's what I'm saying,

475
00:15:53,540 --> 00:15:56,700
dude, imagine if I was fucking here to bet--

476
00:15:56,700 --> 00:15:59,980
- Oh my God, yeah. - 70 to one?

477
00:15:59,980 --> 00:16:02,460
- Maggie was 70 to one, bro.

478
00:16:02,460 --> 00:16:06,220
- Imagine if I was back then and I also knew who did it

479
00:16:06,220 --> 00:16:07,900
and I betted.

480
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:11,420
- That would be so cool to go back in time to bet on this

481
00:16:11,420 --> 00:16:14,260
and then not stop 9/11.

482
00:16:14,260 --> 00:16:16,500
(laughing)

483
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:17,340
- What am I gonna do?

484
00:16:17,340 --> 00:16:19,180
- Yeah, what are you talking about?

485
00:16:19,180 --> 00:16:20,420
- There's nothing I could've done.

486
00:16:20,420 --> 00:16:23,220
- You go back in time to bet on the Simpsons thing.

487
00:16:23,220 --> 00:16:25,180
- Okay, so you can't, you don't warn anybody,

488
00:16:25,180 --> 00:16:26,020
you're like, hey, 9/11's gonna happen.

489
00:16:26,020 --> 00:16:27,620
- Yeah, you know what, yeah, that's a good thing.

490
00:16:27,620 --> 00:16:30,020
Go back in time and say, hey guys, so you know,

491
00:16:30,020 --> 00:16:33,340
two planes are gonna hit some towers and blow up

492
00:16:33,340 --> 00:16:34,420
and then put you in jail.

493
00:16:34,420 --> 00:16:35,260
- Yeah, exactly, yeah.

494
00:16:35,260 --> 00:16:36,140
- The only thing that you're gonna,

495
00:16:36,140 --> 00:16:37,260
people are gonna be like, you're crazy,

496
00:16:37,260 --> 00:16:38,740
and then when it happens, you're going to prison

497
00:16:38,740 --> 00:16:40,020
for the rest of your life, and all of a sudden,

498
00:16:40,020 --> 00:16:42,380
you're Osama bin Laden and Barack Obama's saying,

499
00:16:42,380 --> 00:16:43,860
we killed Patrick Doran.

500
00:16:43,860 --> 00:16:49,620
Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Maybe Osama bin Laden did that. Maybe. Yeah. Maybe he went back in time to

501
00:16:49,620 --> 00:16:53,660
bet on a six-sins game. You go back in time. Okay, I have a mind bender for you. And this

502
00:16:53,660 --> 00:16:56,900
is good for you because you're fucking out off your rocker. Don't give me any kind of

503
00:16:56,900 --> 00:17:02,700
bending land thing. You travel back in time. You warn about 9/11. They throw you in jail

504
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:08,460
with a machine. Come on. And then they throw you in jail. You're in jail. So you traveled

505
00:17:08,460 --> 00:17:13,340
back maybe 20 something years, right? You're in jail for 30 years. So you are in the present

506
00:17:13,340 --> 00:17:16,940
in jail at the same time as when you were about to travel back.

507
00:17:16,940 --> 00:17:17,780
- That's scary.

508
00:17:17,780 --> 00:17:19,960
- And then you could go to jail and meet yourself.

509
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:22,080
And it's you who's, and you like go to jail

510
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:23,480
and you meet yourself and he's like,

511
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:24,600
we shouldn't have warned about that.

512
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:26,000
- I wouldn't even drink that shit

513
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:26,840
and you're making me trip balls.

514
00:17:26,840 --> 00:17:28,040
- I'm tripping you out, right?

515
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:30,240
- You're making me trip fucking balls, dude.

516
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:31,080
- Yeah.

517
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:32,720
- You know, I'd go to jail and I'd shmeet myself.

518
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:35,200
I'd do a conjugal visit and fuck in a fucking trailer

519
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:36,240
outside the prison.

520
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:37,120
- Why would you do that?

521
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:39,520
- Just for fucking, just to laugh again.

522
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:40,360
- Okay.

523
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:41,200
- Yeah.

524
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:42,020
- I think, I guess I--

525
00:17:42,020 --> 00:17:42,860
- By the way, you're 16 and this is--

526
00:17:42,860 --> 00:17:45,500
- This is a scenario where this time travel stuff

527
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:47,380
has happened and I've been in jail for 30 years

528
00:17:47,380 --> 00:17:48,780
and I'm going to visit myself.

529
00:17:48,780 --> 00:17:50,860
I think I'd probably walk into jail and they'd go,

530
00:17:50,860 --> 00:17:52,780
hey, go to jail.

531
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:53,620
- Get back in.

532
00:17:53,620 --> 00:17:54,440
- And they'd put me in jail too.

533
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:55,280
- Get back in here, you bitch.

534
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:57,100
- I think that would, I think they'd also get put in jail.

535
00:17:57,100 --> 00:17:58,260
- That's what the warden says to you.

536
00:17:58,260 --> 00:17:59,100
- Yeah.

537
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:00,700
- Hey, get back in the cell with yourself.

538
00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:02,460
- Get back in the cell and get older too.

539
00:18:02,460 --> 00:18:03,300
- The warden is allowed to look at you.

540
00:18:03,300 --> 00:18:05,300
- You're too young and out of the jail.

541
00:18:05,300 --> 00:18:07,700
(laughing)

542
00:18:07,700 --> 00:18:09,540
- Yeah, the warden's allowed to call you a bitch,

543
00:18:09,540 --> 00:18:10,500
did you know that?

544
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:12,140
- You can say anything. - He is allowed?

545
00:18:12,140 --> 00:18:15,380
- The jail workers can do whatever they want.

546
00:18:15,380 --> 00:18:17,380
That's the type of industry--

547
00:18:17,380 --> 00:18:19,380
- They can't do it by time it's standard.

548
00:18:19,380 --> 00:18:21,420
- It's the same as the restaurant industry,

549
00:18:21,420 --> 00:18:25,780
where a waiter can, if they're willing to forego their tip,

550
00:18:25,780 --> 00:18:26,780
can say anything they want.

551
00:18:26,780 --> 00:18:28,440
- How many times-- - The line cooks get to say

552
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:31,900
whatever the F they want to you in the restaurant.

553
00:18:31,900 --> 00:18:34,620
They say, "You put those eggs on a plate."

554
00:18:34,620 --> 00:18:38,180
- They're the same as a jail guard and a jail warden.

555
00:18:38,180 --> 00:18:39,340
- B-A-S-T-I-D.

556
00:18:39,340 --> 00:18:41,540
- Do you guys think that the most fun part of jail

557
00:18:41,540 --> 00:18:44,860
is when you leave the jail and you have to go do all the

558
00:18:44,860 --> 00:18:47,220
picking up trash or you do a bikini car wash or whatever.

559
00:18:47,220 --> 00:18:49,980
- I think the funnest part is breaking a rock with a pickaxe.

560
00:18:49,980 --> 00:18:50,820
- Yeah.

561
00:18:50,820 --> 00:18:51,640
- That does look so fun.

562
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:52,900
- I think the most fun thing in jail--

563
00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:54,060
- Literally real life Minecraft.

564
00:18:54,060 --> 00:18:57,180
- Is all the loaf, when you get to eat the loaf.

565
00:18:57,180 --> 00:18:58,080
- The loaf?

566
00:18:58,080 --> 00:18:58,920
- Yeah, the loaf.

567
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:01,740
- I guess lunch and dinner time and breakfast time.

568
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:02,700
- I guess I would--

569
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:05,660
- And recess, and TV time.

570
00:19:05,660 --> 00:19:06,500
- Recess would be amazing.

571
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:10,220
- I guess eating and watching TV would be my favorite part.

572
00:19:10,220 --> 00:19:12,100
(laughing)

573
00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:13,340
- And studying the Quran.

574
00:19:13,340 --> 00:19:14,180
- Yeah.

575
00:19:14,180 --> 00:19:16,540
- Yeah, oh my God, joining the Muslim Brotherhood.

576
00:19:16,540 --> 00:19:18,820
- Dude, I personally would love to go to jail

577
00:19:18,820 --> 00:19:20,960
so that when they have an enrichment activity

578
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:22,580
and say they're like, "Oh, we're gonna give you

579
00:19:22,580 --> 00:19:24,980
"a creative writing workshop or something."

580
00:19:24,980 --> 00:19:27,020
And I could just blow everyone's minds.

581
00:19:27,020 --> 00:19:30,300
It's like, yeah, I was about to be an author on the outside

582
00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:32,020
and so I'm just gonna write a novel.

583
00:19:32,020 --> 00:19:34,020
- You can just lie all you want.

584
00:19:34,020 --> 00:19:35,340
- Yeah.

585
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:36,980
- I'm in here for violence.

586
00:19:36,980 --> 00:19:38,100
- You're in there for violence?

587
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:38,940
- Really?

588
00:19:38,940 --> 00:19:41,860
- What's an author, you're an author on the outside

589
00:19:41,860 --> 00:19:44,060
and you go into jail for violence.

590
00:19:44,060 --> 00:19:44,900
- For violence?

591
00:19:44,900 --> 00:19:45,740
- Plate, whoa.

592
00:19:45,740 --> 00:19:46,580
- Yeah, you get locked up.

593
00:19:46,580 --> 00:19:47,940
- Wait, this is a fucking movie idea.

594
00:19:47,940 --> 00:19:49,020
- You get locked up and--

595
00:19:49,020 --> 00:19:50,500
- The copier.

596
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:51,460
- The copycat.

597
00:19:51,460 --> 00:19:52,300
- A nerd--

598
00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:53,460
- The copycat.

599
00:19:53,460 --> 00:19:55,620
- A nerd becomes the president.

600
00:19:55,620 --> 00:19:57,700
A nerd becomes the president, right?

601
00:19:57,700 --> 00:20:00,660
Let's, I mean, whoever, like Buttigieg or something, right?

602
00:20:00,660 --> 00:20:04,340
And then he says, he makes copywriting,

603
00:20:04,340 --> 00:20:08,460
or not copywriting, copycatting and copying

604
00:20:08,460 --> 00:20:11,100
the number one, it's worse than murder.

605
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:13,020
- Public enemy number one in terms of crimes.

606
00:20:13,020 --> 00:20:16,300
- In most states, it's instant death sentence.

607
00:20:16,300 --> 00:20:17,140
- Yeah.

608
00:20:17,140 --> 00:20:19,060
- I just watched a two hour documentary about Amy Schumer.

609
00:20:19,060 --> 00:20:19,940
- About Amy Schumer?

610
00:20:19,940 --> 00:20:21,620
- Yeah, I watch about probably once a year.

611
00:20:21,620 --> 00:20:23,060
- What's she up to?

612
00:20:23,060 --> 00:20:23,900
- Probably--

613
00:20:23,900 --> 00:20:24,860
- You watch it once a year?

614
00:20:24,860 --> 00:20:26,380
- Yeah, you know, pops up.

615
00:20:26,380 --> 00:20:27,220
- Okay.

616
00:20:27,220 --> 00:20:31,780
- But anyway, that is a great idea for a movie.

617
00:20:31,780 --> 00:20:34,660
And that's like the men's version of the Handmaid's Tale.

618
00:20:34,660 --> 00:20:35,500
It's like, oh yeah.

619
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:36,340
- You can't copy anymore.

620
00:20:36,340 --> 00:20:38,340
- You tell me, I can't fucking steal a fucking

621
00:20:38,340 --> 00:20:42,300
- Oh my god, the scene, you know, it's like a dystopia,

622
00:20:42,300 --> 00:20:44,420
right, so then they have the scenes at the beginning

623
00:20:44,420 --> 00:20:46,380
where it's kind of just like all over the country,

624
00:20:46,380 --> 00:20:48,740
it's like showing all these different things collapsing,

625
00:20:48,740 --> 00:20:51,040
and it's like a guy showing up to the bar with his friend

626
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:51,880
and they're wearing the same--

627
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:52,700
- It's a woman narrating it.

628
00:20:52,700 --> 00:20:53,780
- They're wearing, it's not a woman narrating,

629
00:20:53,780 --> 00:20:55,220
it's a man narrating it.

630
00:20:55,220 --> 00:20:57,380
- Okay, so it's a man narrating it at the beginning

631
00:20:57,380 --> 00:20:58,220
and he says the--

632
00:20:58,220 --> 00:20:59,040
- And I'm telling a scene and you're--

633
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:00,500
- You're interrupting, let him finish his scene.

634
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:02,540
- Interrupting is probably even gonna be a bigger crime

635
00:21:02,540 --> 00:21:03,380
than country-catching.

636
00:21:03,380 --> 00:21:04,300
- It's probably the second most crime.

637
00:21:04,300 --> 00:21:05,580
- And he's gonna go to jail forever.

638
00:21:05,580 --> 00:21:07,060
- Yeah, and you show up to the,

639
00:21:07,060 --> 00:21:08,300
and a guy shows up to the bar

640
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:09,740
with the same color shirt as his friend,

641
00:21:09,740 --> 00:21:12,420
or even the same sports team as his friend.

642
00:21:12,420 --> 00:21:13,620
Not even the same shirt. - No, that's different.

643
00:21:13,620 --> 00:21:14,460
- Same sports team.

644
00:21:14,460 --> 00:21:16,380
And listen, you keep interrupting.

645
00:21:16,380 --> 00:21:18,220
What do you think I'm, I'm telling a story here.

646
00:21:18,220 --> 00:21:19,060
- You're going to jail.

647
00:21:19,060 --> 00:21:21,060
- You are going to jail for a thousand years.

648
00:21:21,060 --> 00:21:22,580
And then the cops come,

649
00:21:22,580 --> 00:21:25,140
they put handcuffs on the guy with the same team shirt,

650
00:21:25,140 --> 00:21:26,500
and they say you're going to jail for copying.

651
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:28,860
And he goes, "No, it's not copying!

652
00:21:28,860 --> 00:21:30,260
"It's not the same shirt!

653
00:21:30,260 --> 00:21:31,780
"We're just like the same team!

654
00:21:31,780 --> 00:21:32,980
"No!"

655
00:21:32,980 --> 00:21:37,780
He's getting dragged the fucking way by the corrupt police because they don't enforce the laws the way they should

656
00:21:37,780 --> 00:21:43,540
Because it's not copying and I already thought of that and you're trying to get ahead of me

657
00:21:43,540 --> 00:21:48,380
But you have a brain that's like this. I just got your brain is like this. I just know what yeah

658
00:21:48,380 --> 00:21:52,860
Wait you were you were I was pointing out all the cinema sins. Oh shit. I was copying that no

659
00:21:52,860 --> 00:21:57,300
You're copying a t-rex cuz your brains besides a peanut

660
00:21:57,300 --> 00:22:02,100
Patrick can you see me?

661
00:22:02,100 --> 00:22:04,520
(whispering)

662
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:10,640
- Guys?

663
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:14,640
(screaming)

664
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:15,960
- I scared him by moving,

665
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:17,600
but he couldn't see me because I wasn't moving.

666
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:18,800
- Oh my god.

667
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:21,980
- Wait, I was doing that first,

668
00:22:21,980 --> 00:22:23,680
and you started copying me.

669
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:24,520
- What?

670
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:25,340
- Yeah.

671
00:22:25,340 --> 00:22:26,180
- Doing what?

672
00:22:26,180 --> 00:22:27,020
- I was being still first.

673
00:22:27,020 --> 00:22:27,840
- Guys, we don't exist.

674
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:29,200
- I said Patrick, can you see me?

675
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:30,040
- No, no, no.

676
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:30,880
- We don't exist in the--

677
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:31,720
- What are you talking about?

678
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:33,380
- And now you're lying. - I don't exist in the copycat world.

679
00:22:33,380 --> 00:22:34,220
- Guys, we don't think that we don't exist in--

680
00:22:34,220 --> 00:22:35,060
- Lying is not a crime.

681
00:22:35,060 --> 00:22:36,320
- And now you're interrupting me as well.

682
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:37,160
- No, I'm not. - We don't exist in that--

683
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:38,960
- You're a double, you're a double,

684
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:40,880
you're going to jail for two different reasons.

685
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:42,680
- No, I was interrupting Patrick, not you.

686
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:44,600
- I was interrupting Cal.

687
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:45,440
- Moo.

688
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:49,360
- I knew a kid who would tell that joke

689
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:51,040
with just different animals every time.

690
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:51,880
- Yeah.

691
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:53,400
- And they would get me every time, it's pretty funny.

692
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:54,240
- It's pretty cool.

693
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:55,760
- Yeah, interrupting Cal, moo is a classic.

694
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:56,960
- Interrupting chicken.

695
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:59,320
(Cal yelps)

696
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:00,480
- That's not nice.

697
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:05,660
because you would need to go on a pilgrimage.

698
00:23:05,660 --> 00:23:08,820
You need to learn something about yourself.

699
00:23:08,820 --> 00:23:10,000
Yeah, you are not a bride,

700
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:13,340
if you were on the Jim and Sam show, they'd tear you up.

701
00:23:13,340 --> 00:23:14,180
Yeah?

702
00:23:14,180 --> 00:23:16,560
Oh, for your etiquette with the microphone?

703
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:18,160
What etiquette with the microphone?

704
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:19,720
Bawking like a chicken.

705
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:21,120
Yeah, you can't bawk into the microphone like that.

706
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:22,880
You can't do that, that's rule number one

707
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:25,280
of the fucking etiquette.

708
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:26,120
Is that really?

709
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:27,880
They never did that on Stern.

710
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:28,880
You don't know that.

711
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:29,700
I know.

712
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:31,700
human chicken on there.

713
00:23:31,700 --> 00:23:33,140
- Even he wouldn't bark.

714
00:23:33,140 --> 00:23:34,700
- Yeah, he would do it away from the microphone.

715
00:23:34,700 --> 00:23:35,540
- Even he wouldn't bark.

716
00:23:35,540 --> 00:23:37,640
- Stern would not, if there was a human chicken,

717
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:39,380
Stern wouldn't touch that.

718
00:23:39,380 --> 00:23:40,980
Stern would not even touch a human chicken.

719
00:23:40,980 --> 00:23:41,820
- That's low.

720
00:23:41,820 --> 00:23:43,780
- I would eat human chicken.

721
00:23:43,780 --> 00:23:44,780
- Hunan chicken.

722
00:23:44,780 --> 00:23:47,700
- Yeah, I know that, but I would eat human chicken.

723
00:23:47,700 --> 00:23:48,540
- Yeah.

724
00:23:48,540 --> 00:23:49,360
- Yeah.

725
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:50,200
- If they genetically crossbred a chicken and a human.

726
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:52,100
- Is that more human than a chicken?

727
00:23:52,100 --> 00:23:52,940
- I don't know what it is.

728
00:23:52,940 --> 00:23:53,780
- More human than a chicken.

729
00:23:53,780 --> 00:23:56,500
- I think if I just, if I saw a food called that,

730
00:23:56,500 --> 00:23:57,340
I would eat it.

731
00:23:57,340 --> 00:23:58,160
I don't really know what it is.

732
00:23:58,160 --> 00:24:04,720
I'm interested in food called think about like look at the size of your arm right now and imagine if that was a chicken wing

733
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:07,200
Yo, buff ass fucking chicken. Yeah

734
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:12,340
Imagine that you you're you would eat that for a week

735
00:24:12,340 --> 00:24:15,720
Yeah for a weak-ass plate

736
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:24,000
Be a terrible last meal and oh, I would chicken a chicken wing a big chicken wing that would be disgusting dude

737
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,000
That's like the bit okay

738
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,840
If you take something that's good when it's small

739
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:28,320
and you make it bigger, it gets bad.

740
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:30,640
A big gummy bear is bad.

741
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:32,880
A big giant hamburger is bad.

742
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:34,980
- No, I think it's different with meats.

743
00:24:34,980 --> 00:24:35,820
- No.

744
00:24:35,820 --> 00:24:37,720
- I would say like a hamburger, but like--

745
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:40,080
- Oh, also-- - A big turkey leg?

746
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:40,920
- No, that's actually-- - At the Renaissance Fair.

747
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:42,600
- That's a small turkey leg.

748
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:43,900
- Is it really?

749
00:24:43,900 --> 00:24:44,740
- Yes.

750
00:24:44,740 --> 00:24:46,580
But with--

751
00:24:46,580 --> 00:24:48,820
(laughing)

752
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:51,060
(laughter)

753
00:24:51,060 --> 00:24:57,460
- Yeah it is.

754
00:24:57,460 --> 00:24:59,720
(laughter)

755
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:03,680
- I do think that when you get big chicken wings

756
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:06,920
like from the store, like if you buy your own chicken wings,

757
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:08,600
if you get the big ones, those are bad, dude.

758
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:10,000
Those are the ones that have all the nasty

759
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,500
like pink meat in them.

760
00:25:11,500 --> 00:25:13,200
- Oh yeah, that's a good point.

761
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:14,360
- Fruits too.

762
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:15,200
- Definitely fruits.

763
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:16,440
- Fruits and veggies.

764
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:18,480
- What's the best citrus fruit?

765
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:24,440
I don't know a cutie or a halo the smallest one. What's the worst one a grapefruit the biggest fucking thing in the world

766
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:26,720
And they yeah, you know what yeah, they are bad. They are bag

767
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:30,260
Honeydew melon and a cantaloupe. I like cantaloupe

768
00:25:30,260 --> 00:25:35,960
I like cantaloupe as well and a honeydew tastes like fucking nothing a honeydew melon is even bigger than a grapefruit those fruits

769
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:38,040
You hate all fruits. I

770
00:25:38,040 --> 00:25:43,080
Don't hate all fruit you do. Oh, you know I know one. I know one fruit you like blue raspberry. Yeah

771
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:45,320
(laughter)

772
00:25:45,320 --> 00:25:50,020
- Sour berry.

773
00:25:50,020 --> 00:25:52,480
(laughter)

774
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:56,680
I like sour berries and star berries I guess.

775
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:57,520
Those are good.

776
00:25:57,520 --> 00:26:00,760
- No, I like red typhoon.

777
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:01,600
- You like lemon lime.

778
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:04,680
- Yeah, I like lemon lime, red typhoon, blue raspberry.

779
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:05,520
- Yeah, strawberry kiwi.

00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:08,640
- Yeah, strawberry kiwi, it's my favorite fruit.

781
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:09,480
- Caramel apple.

782
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:10,300
- No, I just can't.

783
00:26:10,300 --> 00:26:12,560
(laughter)

784
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:14,560

802
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:07,760
I didn't want to say this publicly.

803
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:08,760
Okay.

804
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:11,760
I feel like we've been going in a circle with this.

805
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:14,680
Okay, I didn't want to say, I seriously didn't want to bring this up on The Pocket.

806
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:15,680
I really didn't.

807
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:16,680
Okay, you can say it though.

808
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:17,680
I'm not upset.

809
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:20,520
But you are, but your body is disgusting.

810
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:22,720
Like I don't mean that in any way, but you are blowing my-

811
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:25,860
We're saying this as your friends, you are a behemoth.

812
00:27:25,860 --> 00:27:29,440
You are like bordering on, I'm going to have to send you to the hospital.

813
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:32,880
I don't know how I'm going to get you there.

814
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:34,120
You're not going to like this.

815
00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:38,240
I have contacted TLC and there's going to be a show about--

816
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:41,600
My 130 pound life.

817
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:43,760
I'm not 130 pounds.

818
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:45,680
Guess how much I weigh.

819
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:46,920
450.

820
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:49,800
Close.

821
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:51,400
600 pounds.

822
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:52,680
Get in there.

823
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:57,120
1,000 pounds.

824
00:27:57,120 --> 00:27:58,920
I thought so.

825
00:27:58,920 --> 00:28:00,560
That's crazy.

826
00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:03,000
Yeah, I'm sorry to have to bring that up in public.

827
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,540
I know, I didn't want to bring it.

828
00:28:04,540 --> 00:28:07,460
I don't want to say, I mean, I've been stuffing my face.

829
00:28:07,460 --> 00:28:11,100
I knew that, the thing is, I know when I'm snarfing shit down,

830
00:28:11,100 --> 00:28:13,620
I'm like just kind of pigging out and smearing my face.

831
00:28:13,620 --> 00:28:15,220
And that's every day before we record.

832
00:28:15,220 --> 00:28:16,980
I know that the reckoning is coming.

833
00:28:16,980 --> 00:28:17,380
Yeah.

834
00:28:17,380 --> 00:28:18,460
One day you will have a heart attack.

835
00:28:18,460 --> 00:28:19,860
My friends are going to roast me.

836
00:28:19,860 --> 00:28:20,300
Yep.

837
00:28:20,300 --> 00:28:21,300
I don't care about the heart attack.

838
00:28:21,300 --> 00:28:23,060
Hey, I would love to roast you on a spit

839
00:28:23,060 --> 00:28:24,820
and cut your meat off with a shaver.

840
00:28:24,820 --> 00:28:25,340
Yeah.

841
00:28:25,340 --> 00:28:26,580
Make Cambridge shawarma.

842
00:28:26,580 --> 00:28:27,060
Oh.

843
00:28:27,060 --> 00:28:27,620
You do--

844
00:28:27,620 --> 00:28:28,300
I would eat that.

845
00:28:28,300 --> 00:28:29,380
I do think of you--

846
00:28:29,380 --> 00:28:30,020
My own shawarma.

847
00:28:30,020 --> 00:28:32,260
(laughing)

848
00:28:32,260 --> 00:28:37,040
- Put myself on a spit and start shaving myself.

849
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:39,120
- If you had to eat some part of you,

850
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:40,840
that's the number one way to do it.

851
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:41,680
- Shwarma?

852
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:43,640
- Yeah, you just cut off a little slice.

853
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:44,480
- I don't know about--

854
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:46,440
- Imagine how good the spit would feel going up your butt.

855
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:48,440
- No, no, that's not true because a slice is long.

856
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:49,280
- Yeah.

857
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:51,040
- You'd want something, the best thing to eat

858
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:52,720
would be the tiniest piece.

859
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:54,400
- No, you want like a, but I'm not saying

860
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:56,120
you have to eat the whole fucking thing, Cameron.

861
00:28:56,120 --> 00:28:57,720
- But you have to cut it off your body.

862
00:28:57,720 --> 00:28:58,740
- I don't give a fuck.

863
00:28:58,740 --> 00:29:00,980
All you want is fat and skin.

864
00:29:00,980 --> 00:29:01,820
You want a crackling.

865
00:29:01,820 --> 00:29:03,540
- So you're talking strictly on--

866
00:29:03,540 --> 00:29:04,860
- Ooh, Cameron cracklings?

867
00:29:04,860 --> 00:29:05,980
- Yeah. - On taste

868
00:29:05,980 --> 00:29:07,380
and not on harm to yourself.

869
00:29:07,380 --> 00:29:08,220
- I'd love to eat his bones. - Yeah, no,

870
00:29:08,220 --> 00:29:09,060
I don't give a fuck about killing myself.

871
00:29:09,060 --> 00:29:12,180
- And I think the best thing to eat would be your whole body

872
00:29:12,180 --> 00:29:13,020
'cause it has so much--

873
00:29:13,020 --> 00:29:15,300
- Eat my whole body, I don't give a mother fuck.

874
00:29:15,300 --> 00:29:16,900
- Sorry, Cameron.

875
00:29:16,900 --> 00:29:18,900
If you wanna eat your whole fucking body,

876
00:29:18,900 --> 00:29:20,260
be my guest, asshole.

877
00:29:20,260 --> 00:29:21,980
- I do wanna eat my body.

878
00:29:21,980 --> 00:29:24,340
- 'Cause that's gonna be a tough, tough thing to do.

879
00:29:24,340 --> 00:29:27,140
- This is gonna be maybe the worst thing I've ever said.

880
00:29:27,140 --> 00:29:28,980
I'm gonna take a picture of you and post it online

881
00:29:28,980 --> 00:29:31,620
and say you have to eat all of this in a year,

882
00:29:31,620 --> 00:29:33,140
who you bringing.

883
00:29:33,140 --> 00:29:35,060
Because that's how fucking huge you are.

884
00:29:35,060 --> 00:29:37,540
- Yeah, damn I don't know if someone could do it in a year.

885
00:29:37,540 --> 00:29:39,300
- You're too much man for this mouth.

886
00:29:39,300 --> 00:29:40,140
- Oh my God, yeah that's why I--

887
00:29:40,140 --> 00:29:41,720
- You are 450 pounds.

888
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:44,340
- I like to give back to the community

889
00:29:44,340 --> 00:29:47,060
so I take a lot of plane trips that are back and forth.

890
00:29:47,060 --> 00:29:50,140
I just fly to remote places and just come straight back

891
00:29:50,140 --> 00:29:51,500
just in case the plane crashes

892
00:29:51,500 --> 00:29:53,300
and I know everyone can survive

893
00:29:53,300 --> 00:29:54,140
for like months and months and months.

894
00:29:54,140 --> 00:29:55,580
- That's very nice.

895
00:29:55,580 --> 00:29:57,420
- What you don't realize is that you're actually

896
00:29:57,420 --> 00:30:00,700
probably raising the likelihood of it crashing by a lot.

897
00:30:00,700 --> 00:30:01,900
- Yeah, I know, I always have to refuel midair

898
00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:03,820
when I'm on the plane. - By a lot, yeah.

899
00:30:03,820 --> 00:30:05,780
- Yeah, when you fly over Antarctica,

900
00:30:05,780 --> 00:30:09,380
all the walruses said, or the whales said,

901
00:30:09,380 --> 00:30:11,420
we are family, even though you're fatter than me.

902
00:30:11,420 --> 00:30:12,260
- But they come out on the sand of it.

903
00:30:12,260 --> 00:30:14,340
- And I have to sit in the aisle seat,

904
00:30:14,340 --> 00:30:16,300
and yeah, I mean the whole aisle, front to back.

905
00:30:16,300 --> 00:30:18,780
- Yeah, and by aisle, he means an island.

906
00:30:18,780 --> 00:30:23,260
- You're such a, you love the movies, you've told me.

907
00:30:23,260 --> 00:30:24,500
You've told me you love the movies.

908
00:30:24,500 --> 00:30:26,620
- I have told you that a few times.

909
00:30:26,620 --> 00:30:28,260
- But I've learned recently that--

910
00:30:28,260 --> 00:30:31,820
- Patrick, just while I have you here, I love the movies.

911
00:30:31,820 --> 00:30:34,020
- Hey, by the way, I love the movies.

912
00:30:34,020 --> 00:30:36,300
You've told me you love the movies.

913
00:30:36,300 --> 00:30:37,840
Little did I know you love the movies

914
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:39,620
'cause when you go to the movies theater,

915
00:30:39,620 --> 00:30:41,820
they use your ass as the projector screen.

916
00:30:41,820 --> 00:30:44,540
That's why you love the movies.

917
00:30:44,540 --> 00:30:45,380
- 'Cause it's big and white.

918
00:30:45,380 --> 00:30:47,140
- Big and white. - Only one of the chicks.

919
00:30:47,140 --> 00:30:50,260
- Because that would be odd to have a kind of a concave--

920
00:30:50,260 --> 00:30:53,620
- When I go into the movies, the whole room movies, shakes.

921
00:30:53,620 --> 00:30:54,580
- Damn.

922
00:30:54,580 --> 00:30:55,540
- Heavy footsteps.

923
00:30:55,540 --> 00:30:56,380
- Yeah.

924
00:30:56,380 --> 00:30:57,200
- Fat.

925
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:58,040
- Yeah.

926
00:30:58,040 --> 00:31:00,700
- The doctor has to use the Richter scale to measure you.

927
00:31:00,700 --> 00:31:02,060
- Oh my God.

928
00:31:02,060 --> 00:31:03,660
Don't, don't.

929
00:31:03,660 --> 00:31:06,220
- Yeah, and your fat body is disgusting

930
00:31:06,220 --> 00:31:07,660
to every single person who sees it.

931
00:31:07,660 --> 00:31:08,500
- No.

932
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:10,380
- I think, this is the worst thing I'll ever say,

933
00:31:10,380 --> 00:31:13,780
but I think if you got bulimia it would be good.

934
00:31:13,780 --> 00:31:14,620
- It would be good.

935
00:31:14,620 --> 00:31:15,820
- It would be good?

936
00:31:15,820 --> 00:31:16,660
For who?

937
00:31:16,660 --> 00:31:17,620
- For the toilet.

938
00:31:17,620 --> 00:31:20,020
(laughing)

939
00:31:20,020 --> 00:31:20,960
'Cause it's hungry.

940
00:31:21,820 --> 00:31:23,660
and you would be putting a lot in there.

941
00:31:23,660 --> 00:31:24,500
- Yeah.

942
00:31:24,500 --> 00:31:25,460
- It's just telling somebody,

943
00:31:25,460 --> 00:31:27,420
like, you should try out bulimia.

944
00:31:27,420 --> 00:31:28,700
- That's kinda cruel.

945
00:31:28,700 --> 00:31:29,540
- That is cruel.

946
00:31:29,540 --> 00:31:30,360
- Yeah.

947
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:31,200
- That's not very funny to me.

948
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:32,040
- We should get--

949
00:31:32,040 --> 00:31:32,860
- I don't really find that funny.

950
00:31:32,860 --> 00:31:33,700
I don't know about you.

951
00:31:33,700 --> 00:31:34,540
- Even if we're doing--

952
00:31:34,540 --> 00:31:35,360
- You wouldn't, 'cause you're fat.

953
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:36,200
- Yeah.

954
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:37,220
- I just think that it's not funny

955
00:31:37,220 --> 00:31:38,740
to joke about eating disorders.

956
00:31:38,740 --> 00:31:39,580
- We should put you--

957
00:31:39,580 --> 00:31:41,460
- Yeah, your eating disorder of fries.

958
00:31:41,460 --> 00:31:42,340
- That is amazing.

959
00:31:42,340 --> 00:31:43,460
- That's goaded.

960
00:31:43,460 --> 00:31:44,380
- We should get you--

961
00:31:44,380 --> 00:31:45,340
- With ranch.

962
00:31:45,340 --> 00:31:46,180
- With ranch?

963
00:31:46,180 --> 00:31:47,000
- Yeah.

964
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:47,840
- I've never had a ranch in my life.

965
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:52,340
You'd go eat the whole fucking ranch, old McDonald's farm.

966
00:31:52,340 --> 00:31:53,740
- If I lived on a farm.

967
00:31:53,740 --> 00:31:56,520
- The farm lived on you.

968
00:31:56,520 --> 00:31:59,320
- If you lived on the farm,

969
00:31:59,320 --> 00:32:00,960
I just would want to be the guy

970
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:03,160
who selects which animal to eat.

971
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:04,720
- You'd be the guy, you would be the guy

972
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:07,120
with the pressure gun. - I want to have no job.

973
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:07,960
- Oh yeah.

974
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:09,840
- You'd be the guy that shoots the cows.

975
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:12,480
- No, I'd be the guy who, I'd be the guy who's,

976
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:14,440
I'm the foreman or the supervisor.

977
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:16,320
I stand in the room while they have the bolt gun

978
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:19,880
and i stand i stand like twenty feet away i got okay shoot it now

979
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:21,320
it's not a doubt now

980
00:32:21,320 --> 00:32:22,560
judith judith

981
00:32:22,560 --> 00:32:23,500
so they go now

982
00:32:23,500 --> 00:32:26,200
and that's what i think it is that i think you're going to take a look at

983
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:27,840
your reading your packet

984
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:30,240
and i think that what

985
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:34,040
but i don't like that did the page to the package at the pickett

986
00:32:34,040 --> 00:32:36,300
(laughing)

987
00:32:36,300 --> 00:32:37,140
- Oh yeah, shoot that.

988
00:32:37,140 --> 00:32:39,060
- Hand in my waistband.

989
00:32:39,060 --> 00:32:40,900
(laughing)

990
00:32:40,900 --> 00:32:43,620
- A pinky in my waistband, hand on my stomach, shirt off.

991
00:32:43,620 --> 00:32:45,300
- Now shoot the farmer's dog.

992
00:32:45,300 --> 00:32:46,380
- Shoot that.

993
00:32:46,380 --> 00:32:47,580
- Now shoot that.

994
00:32:47,580 --> 00:32:49,140
Lunch break.

995
00:32:49,140 --> 00:32:49,980
- For me.

996
00:32:49,980 --> 00:32:52,300
(laughing)

997
00:32:52,300 --> 00:32:53,300
- Keep killing.

998
00:32:53,300 --> 00:32:55,100
Do that one, then that one, then that one, then that one.

999
00:32:55,100 --> 00:32:57,540
(laughing)

1000
00:32:57,540 --> 00:32:59,300
- That would be an amazing job.

1001
00:32:59,300 --> 00:33:00,140
- Yeah.

1002
00:33:00,140 --> 00:33:01,860
- I kinda think I wanna get into farming,

1003
00:33:01,860 --> 00:33:03,340
but it seems too hard, so I won't.

1004
00:33:03,340 --> 00:33:06,920
I went to a farm that was owned by my mom's friend.

1005
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:08,220
- Whoa!

1006
00:33:08,220 --> 00:33:10,140
- Your mom's rich or something?

1007
00:33:10,140 --> 00:33:11,740
- Were they rich or something like that?

1008
00:33:11,740 --> 00:33:14,100
- My mom's rich 'cause she has a friend who's a farmer.

1009
00:33:14,100 --> 00:33:15,260
(laughing)

1010
00:33:15,260 --> 00:33:16,540
- You gotta be rich.

1011
00:33:16,540 --> 00:33:17,620
- What does your mom do?

1012
00:33:17,620 --> 00:33:19,140
She was your fireman?

1013
00:33:19,140 --> 00:33:20,380
- Yeah.

1014
00:33:20,380 --> 00:33:21,780
- Does she drive an apple car?

1015
00:33:21,780 --> 00:33:25,420
- Richard's scary ass motherfucking town.

1016
00:33:25,420 --> 00:33:28,020
Damn dude, this kava is hitting me hard.

1017
00:33:28,020 --> 00:33:31,140
- But the farm, it seemed like such hard work.

1018
00:33:31,140 --> 00:33:33,380
and there was so many animals to take care of

1019
00:33:33,380 --> 00:33:35,020
and there was bees in the house.

1020
00:33:35,020 --> 00:33:37,660
- That sounded exactly like a children's book.

1021
00:33:37,660 --> 00:33:38,500
- There were bees.

1022
00:33:38,500 --> 00:33:39,600
- The farm seemed hard.

1023
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:42,080
There were so many animals to take care of.

1024
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:44,720
- And there were goats that acted like dogs.

1025
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:45,560
- No.

1026
00:33:45,560 --> 00:33:47,580
- And cats that acted like stray cats.

1027
00:33:47,580 --> 00:33:50,380
- Does your mom's farmer friend ever go down to the dell?

1028
00:33:50,380 --> 00:33:52,660
- I don't think they have the farm anymore.

1029
00:33:52,660 --> 00:33:54,780
- Do they ever go down to the dell when they had it?

1030
00:33:54,780 --> 00:33:55,620
- I don't know what a dell is.

1031
00:33:55,620 --> 00:33:56,460
- In the dell?

1032
00:33:56,460 --> 00:33:57,300
Do they ever go in the dell?

1033
00:33:57,300 --> 00:33:59,540
- I don't know what a dell is.

1034
00:33:59,540 --> 00:34:00,420
- Farmer in the dell?

1035
00:34:00,420 --> 00:34:03,100
I know that, but I don't know what a Dell is, so you're gonna...

1036
00:34:03,100 --> 00:34:06,220
I guess nowadays Dell would just mean computer.

1037
00:34:06,220 --> 00:34:07,220
Yeah, nowadays.

1038
00:34:07,220 --> 00:34:08,220
Nowadays it would just mean computer.

1039
00:34:08,220 --> 00:34:09,220
That's why they gave up the farm.

1040
00:34:09,220 --> 00:34:10,220
Nowadays, they got into computers.

1041
00:34:10,220 --> 00:34:17,020
Yeah, they got into computers, and now it's probably a Bitcoin mining farm or Farmville.

1042
00:34:17,020 --> 00:34:22,100
A Dell is a computer for kind of like a Yolkel fucking...

1043
00:34:22,100 --> 00:34:23,100
Yeah, that is.

1044
00:34:23,100 --> 00:34:25,940
'Cause if they were a real artist or a tech head, they'd be on a MacBook.

1045
00:34:25,940 --> 00:34:27,300
A MacBook or a Surface.

1046
00:34:27,300 --> 00:34:28,300
Yeah, or a Surface Pro.

1047
00:34:28,300 --> 00:34:29,300
Surface Pro.

1048
00:34:29,300 --> 00:34:32,800
Dell Inspiron tablet is good for creatives?

1049
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:33,980
Maybe if you're fucking straight.

1050
00:34:33,980 --> 00:34:37,220
Listen, pal, Dell is school library core.

1051
00:34:37,220 --> 00:34:38,060
Yeah, absolutely.

1052
00:34:38,060 --> 00:34:39,860
You keep unplugging your mic.

1053
00:34:39,860 --> 00:34:41,260
I'm not unplugging my mic.

1054
00:34:41,260 --> 00:34:42,100
It's your heft.

1055
00:34:42,100 --> 00:34:42,920
It's the--

1056
00:34:42,920 --> 00:34:44,260
Your heft is pulling it down.

1057
00:34:44,260 --> 00:34:46,540
This thing is broken.

1058
00:34:46,540 --> 00:34:48,300
Yeah, 'cause you sat on it.

1059
00:34:48,300 --> 00:34:49,140
Man.

1060
00:34:49,140 --> 00:34:52,860
(laughing)

1061
00:34:52,860 --> 00:34:55,420
Oh God, he sat on the whole damn thing.

1062
00:34:55,420 --> 00:34:56,260
Damn.

1063
00:34:56,260 --> 00:34:58,180
Oh, you're blowing me away over here

1064
00:34:58,180 --> 00:34:59,380
when you blow into that.

1065
00:34:59,380 --> 00:35:00,580
Oh, God.

1066
00:35:00,580 --> 00:35:02,380
He thought the mic was a glizzy.

1067
00:35:02,380 --> 00:35:04,980
That's why when fat people blow, it's really strong.

1068
00:35:04,980 --> 00:35:06,580
Because they have such big tummies.

1069
00:35:06,580 --> 00:35:07,380
And they're huge.

1070
00:35:07,380 --> 00:35:08,940
Yeah, they have really strong lungs.

1071
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:10,620
And what do you mean when fat people do?

1072
00:35:10,620 --> 00:35:12,820
I'm talking about you, big guy.

1073
00:35:12,820 --> 00:35:13,700
Big O.

1074
00:35:13,700 --> 00:35:14,540
Yeah.

1075
00:35:14,540 --> 00:35:15,380
You're like a Goron.

1076
00:35:15,380 --> 00:35:18,540
They did a lung test on me, and I wanted to die.

1077
00:35:18,540 --> 00:35:21,380
Did you-- what score did you get?

1078
00:35:21,380 --> 00:35:22,620
I didn't see it yet.

1079
00:35:22,620 --> 00:35:23,900
You haven't looked at it?

1080
00:35:23,900 --> 00:35:26,260
It's best to just never look at whatever the doctor--

1081
00:35:26,260 --> 00:35:27,900
Oh, if there's something they need to tell me.

1082
00:35:27,900 --> 00:35:32,540
Last time I looked at my medical test records, there's a bunch of yellowed exclamation points

1083
00:35:32,540 --> 00:35:33,540
that said "abnormal."

1084
00:35:33,540 --> 00:35:34,540
Yeah, when that shows up, don't click it.

1085
00:35:34,540 --> 00:35:37,540
And I thought, "I never need to look at this again."

1086
00:35:37,540 --> 00:35:38,940
I don't want to know that I'm...

1087
00:35:38,940 --> 00:35:42,700
And then I got to the doctor, and the whole month I was thinking about it, "What does

1088
00:35:42,700 --> 00:35:43,940
that mean, 'abnormal'?"

1089
00:35:43,940 --> 00:35:48,040
And I Googled it, and they said all these long words I don't know.

1090
00:35:48,040 --> 00:35:50,340
For the definition of abnormal?

1091
00:35:50,340 --> 00:35:51,340
Yeah.

1092
00:35:51,340 --> 00:35:52,340
Oh, wow.

1093
00:35:52,340 --> 00:35:54,680
And then I get to the doctor, and she says, "Yeah, this is normal.

1094
00:35:54,680 --> 00:35:56,140
It says abnormal, but it's normal."

1095
00:35:56,140 --> 00:35:57,140
Oh, fuck them.

1096
00:35:57,140 --> 00:35:59,140
Fuck them, man.

1097
00:35:59,140 --> 00:36:01,140
But so I'm not going to look at my breathing test results.

1098
00:36:01,140 --> 00:36:04,140
But what if it says you have water breath?

1099
00:36:04,140 --> 00:36:05,140
What's water breath?

1100
00:36:05,140 --> 00:36:06,140
What if you can breathe underwater?

1101
00:36:06,140 --> 00:36:08,140
Did they do that test with you?

1102
00:36:08,140 --> 00:36:09,140
No.

1103
00:36:09,140 --> 00:36:11,140
What if you have a natural rebreather in your body?

1104
00:36:11,140 --> 00:36:13,140
They did a test if I could breathe into a tube in a glass box.

1105
00:36:13,140 --> 00:36:16,140
I'll tell you one thing, if I could breathe underwater, I would be switching careers,

1106
00:36:16,140 --> 00:36:19,140
and I'd be a professional apple bopper pretty, pretty fast.

1107
00:36:19,140 --> 00:36:20,140
Yeah.

1108
00:36:20,140 --> 00:36:21,140
I think I'd be making way more money.

1109
00:36:21,140 --> 00:36:23,140
Do they do that on ESPN2?

1110
00:36:23,140 --> 00:36:24,140
No, they do it on ESPN1.

1111
00:36:24,140 --> 00:36:25,140
Yeah?

1112
00:36:25,140 --> 00:36:27,140
Yeah, that's that's a huge

1113
00:36:27,140 --> 00:36:34,780
Tank is like big this summer dude. I one time don't some Olympics dunk tank is gonna be really that's where USA is like

1114
00:36:34,780 --> 00:36:40,780
Okay, that's where they're poised to take the gold dunk tank is I was sitting in a dunk tank and the kid the kid a kid

1115
00:36:40,780 --> 00:36:45,020
Misses and he does the thing he runs up and presses it. Yeah, I'd kill him. Yeah, you have to I

1116
00:36:45,020 --> 00:36:52,220
Lives I'd kill him they should on that target. There should be like a spike that comes out. Yes, that is genius or electrical

1117
00:36:52,940 --> 00:36:53,780
- It's shocking.

1118
00:36:53,780 --> 00:36:55,080
- Or just a normal gun.

1119
00:36:55,080 --> 00:36:55,920
- Yeah.

1120
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:57,480
- If you were in the Olympics dunk tank,

1121
00:36:57,480 --> 00:37:00,340
'cause the Olympics version of the dunk tank

1122
00:37:00,340 --> 00:37:01,360
is the same as curling,

1123
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:03,160
where there's like a thrower and a sweeper.

1124
00:37:03,160 --> 00:37:04,520
Would you rather be the thrower

1125
00:37:04,520 --> 00:37:06,480
or would you rather be the dunker?

1126
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:08,680
- Probably dunker.

1127
00:37:08,680 --> 00:37:11,440
- I feel like you have more of a dunker physiognomy.

1128
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:13,600
- Well yeah, so it's like the dunker thing,

1129
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:18,720
the Olympic dunk tank is not like carnival dunk tank.

1130
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:21,880
It's like a big tube that has like meters on it.

1131
00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:22,720
- So you're trying to do a cannonball.

1132
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:25,080
- You're trying to get a big, big fat guy in the dunk.

1133
00:37:25,080 --> 00:37:25,920
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1134
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:28,200
- So when you throw that, you got a real skinny mini

1135
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:30,520
throwing the fucking ball at the target.

1136
00:37:30,520 --> 00:37:31,360
- So Cameron should be the dunker.

1137
00:37:31,360 --> 00:37:32,560
- A wiry, a wiry...

1138
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:36,000
- You dunker or the thrower?

1139
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:36,840
- You wanna be the dunker.

1140
00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:38,400
- It's so funny every time, but it's so mean.

1141
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:39,980
- You dunk yourself.

1142
00:37:39,980 --> 00:37:42,720
- Okay, dunker sounds like the person who dunks the person.

1143
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:43,960
- Well, that's true.

1144
00:37:43,960 --> 00:37:45,480
It should be dunker and dunkey.

1145
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:47,680
- Yeah, I think that's more, it makes more sense.

1146
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:49,640
- No, listen, it's from a different language.

1147
00:37:49,640 --> 00:37:51,120
- Dunker and dunking.

1148
00:37:51,120 --> 00:37:51,960
- Yeah.

1149
00:37:51,960 --> 00:37:53,440
- It's the dunker and the thrower.

1150
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:55,120
- I would wanna be the guy who gets dunked

1151
00:37:55,120 --> 00:37:57,040
'cause you don't have to do anything, you sit there.

1152
00:37:57,040 --> 00:37:57,880
- No, that's not true. - If I would get--

1153
00:37:57,880 --> 00:37:59,120
- That's not true, you gotta like--

1154
00:37:59,120 --> 00:38:01,560
- I would get so much performance anxiety.

1155
00:38:01,560 --> 00:38:03,120
- You're style points. - That's easy though.

1156
00:38:03,120 --> 00:38:06,840
I ooze style, I bleeds, I get style every day of my life.

1157
00:38:06,840 --> 00:38:08,640
I walk down the street and people say,

1158
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:11,640
"Who's that, who's that, what's he doing?

1159
00:38:11,640 --> 00:38:13,680
"Get away from me, what's he doing?"

1160
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:16,240
- You know-- - Show me your dunker,

1161
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:17,600
show me your dunker pose.

1162
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:20,160
This is you sitting in the dunk tank, right?

1163
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:23,840
You're on Olympic TV and you're ready to be,

1164
00:38:23,840 --> 00:38:25,560
you're about to be dunked.

1165
00:38:25,560 --> 00:38:27,960
This is when the camera pans to you for the first time.

1166
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:28,800
Okay, I'll set it.

1167
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:31,000
- Do you guys have, wait, no, I just need,

1168
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:32,200
do you guys have any glasses?

1169
00:38:32,200 --> 00:38:33,120
Do you guys have glasses?

1170
00:38:33,120 --> 00:38:34,200
Do you guys have a newspaper?

1171
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:35,040
- No.

1172
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:35,860
- Okay, then imagine those things.

1173
00:38:35,860 --> 00:38:36,700
- Okay, okay.

1174
00:38:36,700 --> 00:38:37,540
- Okay, ready, ready?

1175
00:38:37,540 --> 00:38:42,080
- Now coming up for the Olympic dunker,

1176
00:38:42,080 --> 00:38:43,680
dunk tank competition.

1177
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:47,160
- How are you so bad?

1178
00:38:47,160 --> 00:38:48,880
- Cameron Fretter from USA.

1179
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:50,880
This is his first time in the dunk tank.

1180
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:52,880
Just tell me when the camera cuts to me.

1181
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:54,880
Just tell me when the camera cuts to me.

1182
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:56,880
Me and Caleb are on this side.

1183
00:38:56,880 --> 00:38:58,880
I'm the thrower.

1184
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:00,880
This is my introduction.

1185
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:02,880
This is not when I get dunked.

1186
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:04,880
Right now it's on Caleb.

1187
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:06,880
Now Caleb Pitts and Cameron Fetter

1188
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:08,880
from Team USA.

1189
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:10,880
This is their first dunk tank competition.

1190
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:12,880
First time dunk tank has been

1191
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:14,880
in the Olympics.

1192
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:16,880
We're going to see

1193
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:18,880
what this sport is all about.

1194
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:24,880
Now, camera's turning over to Fetter sitting in the dunk tank.

1195
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:29,880
And I believe that he is wearing glasses and reading a newspaper in the dunk tank.

1196
00:39:29,880 --> 00:39:35,880
He does not seem to have a care in the world about what's about to happen to him.

1197
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:37,880
He's yawning.

1198
00:39:37,880 --> 00:39:43,880
He's yawning. He's yawning and fanning his breasts with the newspaper.

1199
00:39:43,880 --> 00:39:48,880
He's pretending that it's a real hot day out and oh it looks like he's sleeping.

1200
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:52,480
Looks like he's sleeping in the dunk tank.

1201
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:54,240
And it dunks!

1202
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:57,720
It dunks, he goes down.

1203
00:39:57,720 --> 00:39:59,760
He looks surprised now.

1204
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:02,360
He looks surprised and let's see how many meters he's fallen in.

1205
00:40:02,360 --> 00:40:03,360
20 meters.

1206
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:04,360
20 meters.

1207
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:05,360
20 meters deep.

1208
00:40:05,360 --> 00:40:06,360
That's really, that would hurt.

1209
00:40:06,360 --> 00:40:07,360
That's really deep.

1210
00:40:07,360 --> 00:40:08,360
That would really hurt.

1211
00:40:08,360 --> 00:40:09,360
60 feet.

1212
00:40:09,360 --> 00:40:10,360
That would really really hurt.

1213
00:40:10,360 --> 00:40:11,480
That would really hurt.

1214
00:40:11,480 --> 00:40:12,480
60 feet.

1215
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:14,000
That would really, really hurt.

1216
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:15,320
To do 20 meters.

1217
00:40:15,320 --> 00:40:17,960
And it looks like Team USA is going to be winning the dunk

1218
00:40:17,960 --> 00:40:20,680
tank this year.

1219
00:40:20,680 --> 00:40:23,400
Well, see, that's because if you're getting dunked,

1220
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:26,960
you want to seem nonchalant so that it hits harder

1221
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:27,520
when you dunk.

1222
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:27,880
Sure.

1223
00:40:27,880 --> 00:40:28,280
You don't--

1224
00:40:28,280 --> 00:40:29,400
Because you have to play the heel.

1225
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:30,280
You have to play the heel.

1226
00:40:30,280 --> 00:40:30,280
There's no way.

1227
00:40:30,280 --> 00:40:30,520
No.

1228
00:40:30,520 --> 00:40:31,800
You have to be like, fuck these Olympics.

1229
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:32,320
Oh, yeah.

1230
00:40:32,320 --> 00:40:34,080
I don't give a fuck about 60 meters.

1231
00:40:34,080 --> 00:40:35,760
I put 60 meters in my ass.

1232
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:36,760
Yeah.

1233
00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:38,000
He's down 60 meters.

1234
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:38,760
Wait, is that like--

1235
00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:39,240
Perfect 10.

1236
00:40:39,240 --> 00:40:39,880
Perfect 10 gold.

1237
00:40:39,880 --> 00:40:43,560
60 meters and then the water or like into the water and 60 meters under water?

1238
00:40:43,560 --> 00:40:45,560
60 meters but then you have to bob back up.

1239
00:40:45,560 --> 00:40:47,560
But okay you didn't answer my question at all.

1240
00:40:47,560 --> 00:40:48,060
No.

1241
00:40:48,060 --> 00:40:55,560
Is it you fall 60 meters and then you hit the water or is it you fall into the water and then go 60 meters down into the water?

1242
00:40:55,560 --> 00:40:58,560
Woah so you drop from like fucking 600 feet up.

1243
00:40:58,560 --> 00:41:00,560
Yeah you gotta...

1244
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:02,560
Holy shit.

1245
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:04,560
No it's a regular...

1246
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:06,560
No it's the Olympics.

1247
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:08,560
It's the Olympics they figured all of this out.

1248
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:14,640
60 feet the pressure won't fuck you yeah, 60 meters. Oh 60 meters. Yeah, no 20 was it 20 meters

1249
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:20,360
Yeah, but then we upgraded it. Okay. We're starting it. This is already become the most by far the most dangerous Olympic

1250
00:41:20,360 --> 00:41:25,940
Best Olympia guys remember when do you guys remember when the the bobsled people?

1251
00:41:25,940 --> 00:41:30,320
The highest dive is 52.5. Yes

1252
00:41:30,320 --> 00:41:36,040
So it's essentially you're sitting on a pressure plate that knocks you down so hard

1253
00:41:36,840 --> 00:41:42,520
That you're basic. It's basically high dive with another down. It doesn't you don't just drop it like pushes you straight

1254
00:41:42,520 --> 00:41:49,800
That's all based on the pressure of the thrower uh-huh, so he did a good throw. Yeah, good work. Thank you

1255
00:41:49,800 --> 00:41:53,120
It's a team effort. Yeah, he's the style

1256
00:41:53,120 --> 00:41:58,440
It's like it's like as if we took gymnastics, and we split the style and the technical points in half

1257
00:41:58,440 --> 00:42:01,720
That is such a good way to look at it. I call you're the style. Yeah

1258
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:09,320
Which I mean I do that all day. I'll take technicality. I'm not much much much one for style. Yeah style for me

1259
00:42:09,320 --> 00:42:11,040
It's like I'm not really

1260
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:12,600
passionate about it

1261
00:42:12,600 --> 00:42:14,600
I'm not really

1262
00:42:14,600 --> 00:42:23,320
Okay, I'm not really passionate about style. It's just something that I am you are look at that amazing ah

1263
00:42:23,320 --> 00:42:30,900
It looks like anime character right there, oh, I'm sorry fuck you're gonna make me fucking smile

1264
00:42:30,900 --> 00:42:33,160
(laughing)

1265
00:42:33,160 --> 00:42:35,100
- How did that poke you back in the eye?

1266
00:42:35,100 --> 00:42:36,060
- It went into my eye.

1267
00:42:36,060 --> 00:42:38,180
- See, but he's so just nonchalant, he's not--

1268
00:42:38,180 --> 00:42:40,300
- Look, his brain is never chalanted.

1269
00:42:40,300 --> 00:42:42,980
- If that happened to me, I'd be freaking out.

1270
00:42:42,980 --> 00:42:43,820
I'd be screaming.

1271
00:42:43,820 --> 00:42:45,740
- You guys are literally obsessed with me.

1272
00:42:45,740 --> 00:42:46,580
- I'm fucked.

1273
00:42:46,580 --> 00:42:47,940
- Have you guys noticed that you're obsessed with me?

1274
00:42:47,940 --> 00:42:48,780
- Okay.

1275
00:42:48,780 --> 00:42:51,020
- We're trying to make you, we're trying to get in your head

1276
00:42:51,020 --> 00:42:52,860
to make you think you're a fetish.

1277
00:42:52,860 --> 00:42:54,980
- So that you will go for guys like us.

1278
00:42:54,980 --> 00:42:57,220
(laughing)

1279
00:42:58,620 --> 00:43:01,260
But mind you, you look like Zac Efron.

1280
00:43:01,260 --> 00:43:02,100
You look fucking amazing.

1281
00:43:02,100 --> 00:43:04,820
For real, like before or after he slid his jaw open

1282
00:43:04,820 --> 00:43:06,060
on his table. In between.

1283
00:43:06,060 --> 00:43:07,780
He slid his own jaw.

1284
00:43:07,780 --> 00:43:10,100
In between him slitting his jaw.

1285
00:43:10,100 --> 00:43:12,940
Do you guys remember that when he got a face surgery

1286
00:43:12,940 --> 00:43:15,860
and he said, "My chin was hanging off my face

1287
00:43:15,860 --> 00:43:17,140
'cause I tripped on my cup."

1288
00:43:17,140 --> 00:43:22,140
Yeah, and then he claimed that happened in like 2013 also,

1289
00:43:22,140 --> 00:43:24,540
it started swelling up 10 years later for no reason.

1290
00:43:24,540 --> 00:43:26,660
And then everybody was like, "That's fucking bullshit."

1291
00:43:26,660 --> 00:43:30,160
And then he was like, "You know I'm really insecure about my face, right?"

1292
00:43:30,160 --> 00:43:32,160
Yeah, he should be dude. He looks like a freak.

1293
00:43:32,160 --> 00:43:33,160
Yeah.

1294
00:43:33,160 --> 00:43:36,660
Man, he looks good in that movie. He just had HGH, it's fine.

1295
00:43:36,660 --> 00:43:40,160
Yeah, it's okay for Zac Efron to do HGH.

1296
00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:41,160
Look at that physique.

1297
00:43:41,160 --> 00:43:42,160
Because he was in a kids movie.

1298
00:43:42,160 --> 00:43:46,660
He was in a kids movie, which is why it's okay for him to have a weird adulthood.

1299
00:43:46,660 --> 00:43:51,160
His new face, I feel like he's maybe prepping to be in a Sin City movie.

1300
00:43:51,160 --> 00:43:53,660
Yeah, that would be really good in black and white.

1301
00:43:53,660 --> 00:43:55,660
He is prepping to play a wrestler.

1302
00:43:55,660 --> 00:43:56,660
Really?

1303
00:43:56,660 --> 00:43:59,220
He's doing some wrestling movie now.

1304
00:43:59,220 --> 00:44:01,260
He does look very different there.

1305
00:44:01,260 --> 00:44:02,900
Yeah, no, he looks pretty fucked up.

1306
00:44:02,900 --> 00:44:04,700
He looks like Zach Braff there.

1307
00:44:04,700 --> 00:44:07,580
Do you guys think that we'll ever get to that level?

1308
00:44:07,580 --> 00:44:08,580
Battery's low.

1309
00:44:08,580 --> 00:44:09,580
Oh, okay.

1310
00:44:09,580 --> 00:44:11,380
Do you guys think we could ever be at that level of celebrity?

1311
00:44:11,380 --> 00:44:12,380
No.

1312
00:44:12,380 --> 00:44:13,380
What level?

1313
00:44:13,380 --> 00:44:14,380
Zach Efron's level?

1314
00:44:14,380 --> 00:44:15,380
Where maybe we get some plastic surgery?

1315
00:44:15,380 --> 00:44:17,260
You don't have to be a celebrity to get plastic surgery.

1316
00:44:17,260 --> 00:44:20,660
You can just have to have some money or some good friends.

1317
00:44:20,660 --> 00:44:25,740
There is a place in my new neighborhood that I saw is a plastic surgery center and they

1318
00:44:25,740 --> 00:44:28,180
advertise BBLs in the window.

1319
00:44:28,180 --> 00:44:31,340
Oh yeah, I know that place.

1320
00:44:31,340 --> 00:44:34,460
Is that also the place that says like pussy tightening or something?

1321
00:44:34,460 --> 00:44:35,460
No, where's that?

1322
00:44:35,460 --> 00:44:36,460
That's on Myrtle.

1323
00:44:36,460 --> 00:44:39,780
It has a picture of a woman's asshole.

1324
00:44:39,780 --> 00:44:41,780
I think it might be this place.

1325
00:44:41,780 --> 00:44:42,780
Pink building?

1326
00:44:42,780 --> 00:44:47,580
Yeah, next to the atomic wings.

1327
00:44:47,580 --> 00:44:48,900
I walk by it every day.

1328
00:44:48,900 --> 00:44:51,440
- It's literally the most, like,

1329
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:53,940
if you put those two businesses next to like,

1330
00:44:53,940 --> 00:44:58,120
like a sweeping shot and like Blade Runner,

1331
00:44:58,120 --> 00:45:00,240
like it's like Atomic Wings,

1332
00:45:00,240 --> 00:45:02,200
and then next to it is Pussy Titans.

1333
00:45:02,200 --> 00:45:03,200
(laughing)

1334
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:05,060
- Do you think that when you get a BBL,

1335
00:45:05,060 --> 00:45:06,500
it's like when you get braces,

1336
00:45:06,500 --> 00:45:08,760
they're like don't eat anything that ends with O's,

1337
00:45:08,760 --> 00:45:11,360
because when it comes out, it's gonna blow your butt off?

1338
00:45:11,360 --> 00:45:13,120
- Yeah, there's a bunch of stuff you can't do

1339
00:45:13,120 --> 00:45:14,080
when you get a BBL.

1340
00:45:14,080 --> 00:45:15,240
- You literally like--

1341
00:45:15,240 --> 00:45:16,080
- How do you know?

1342
00:45:16,080 --> 00:45:17,800
- Who was saying, somebody was telling me--

1343
00:45:17,800 --> 00:45:20,840
- Nate was telling us that on the last episode.

1344
00:45:20,840 --> 00:45:21,680
- That's what it was?

1345
00:45:21,680 --> 00:45:23,960
- No, he didn't tell us about what you can't eat.

1346
00:45:23,960 --> 00:45:26,880
- He said that somebody was on a plane.

1347
00:45:26,880 --> 00:45:28,720
- I think also, can't you not sit on it or something?

1348
00:45:28,720 --> 00:45:30,960
- You cannot sit on it immediately.

1349
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:34,080
- And I think also you can't slit it with a knife

1350
00:45:34,080 --> 00:45:36,720
or slice it up or put it into a crusher.

1351
00:45:36,720 --> 00:45:38,520
- What is the process of the BBL?

1352
00:45:38,520 --> 00:45:39,600
- So what's the point?

1353
00:45:39,600 --> 00:45:43,440
- The BBL is like they're breaking your rib cage

1354
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:45,620
so that all the fat goes to your butt.

1355
00:45:46,500 --> 00:45:48,900
- What are you talking, no.

1356
00:45:48,900 --> 00:45:51,900
Don't break your rib cage.

1357
00:45:51,900 --> 00:45:56,020
- They break, okay, lipo from your lower body and then--

1358
00:45:56,020 --> 00:45:57,780
- They put fat in your ass.

1359
00:45:57,780 --> 00:45:58,780
- Purified and injected.

1360
00:45:58,780 --> 00:46:00,740
- You thought they'd break your bones?

1361
00:46:00,740 --> 00:46:01,940
- What am I thinking of?

1362
00:46:01,940 --> 00:46:02,780
- A waist--

1363
00:46:02,780 --> 00:46:04,620
- You're thinking of friggin' Marilyn Manson.

1364
00:46:04,620 --> 00:46:05,460
- Yeah.

1365
00:46:05,460 --> 00:46:07,380
- Oh, I'm conflating the two.

1366
00:46:07,380 --> 00:46:08,220
- Yeah.

1367
00:46:08,220 --> 00:46:09,300
- You're thinking about inflating

1368
00:46:09,300 --> 00:46:11,900
where you go with her too. - And I want to inflate my butt.

1369
00:46:11,900 --> 00:46:15,300
- Yeah, and also, I don't know why it's,

1370
00:46:15,300 --> 00:46:17,100
I don't know what is so Brazilian about this.

1371
00:46:17,100 --> 00:46:19,300
- My sister's ex told me-- - Is this what picanha is?

1372
00:46:19,300 --> 00:46:21,460
- My sister's ex told me that Brazilian people

1373
00:46:21,460 --> 00:46:22,820
are obsessed with butts.

1374
00:46:22,820 --> 00:46:26,100
And I don't know if I really believe that, honestly.

1375
00:46:26,100 --> 00:46:27,740
- You should see Rio.

1376
00:46:27,740 --> 00:46:30,820
- Do you know what Brazilian people are obsessed with?

1377
00:46:30,820 --> 00:46:31,660
- Food. - Jiu-jitsu.

1378
00:46:31,660 --> 00:46:32,700
- Brazil.

1379
00:46:32,700 --> 00:46:33,540
- Yeah. - They always go there.

1380
00:46:33,540 --> 00:46:35,220
- They love Brazil.

1381
00:46:35,220 --> 00:46:36,040
They love Brazil.

1382
00:46:36,040 --> 00:46:38,220
- If they live in America, they always go to Brazil.

1383
00:46:38,220 --> 00:46:39,660
- And they love soccer as well.

1384
00:46:39,660 --> 00:46:42,860
- Yeah, some of them, but most of them go to Brazil.

1385
00:46:42,860 --> 00:46:45,980
is obsessed with extreme sports.

1386
00:46:45,980 --> 00:46:47,000
- That's, yeah.

1387
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:48,080
- Bob Burnquist.

1388
00:46:48,080 --> 00:46:50,220
- I don't even know who that is.

1389
00:46:50,220 --> 00:46:52,540
- He jumped the Grand Canyon on a skateboard.

1390
00:46:52,540 --> 00:46:53,380
- Oh.

1391
00:46:53,380 --> 00:46:54,660
- For a second I thought it was gonna be someone

1392
00:46:54,660 --> 00:46:55,660
I was supposed to know who it was.

1393
00:46:55,660 --> 00:46:56,500
- I'd like to jump him.

1394
00:46:56,500 --> 00:46:58,500
- You're supposed to know who Bob Burnquist is.

1395
00:46:58,500 --> 00:46:59,340
- No you're not.

1396
00:46:59,340 --> 00:47:00,660
- I wish I didn't know who you were.

1397
00:47:00,660 --> 00:47:02,920
(laughing)

1398
00:47:02,920 --> 00:47:07,260
- Yeah.

1399
00:47:07,260 --> 00:47:09,300
- I want Alzheimer's right now.

1400
00:47:09,300 --> 00:47:10,140
- Yeah.

1401
00:47:10,140 --> 00:47:10,960
- Do you guys think that you're gonna--

1402
00:47:10,960 --> 00:47:12,340
- So you can forget that you've never seen your penis

1403
00:47:12,340 --> 00:47:13,240
- Okay. - Or your fat belly.

1404
00:47:13,240 --> 00:47:15,260
- Do you guys think that you'll die of cancer?

1405
00:47:15,260 --> 00:47:17,580
- Okay, I may be fat, but I got a big ass dick

1406
00:47:17,580 --> 00:47:19,580
that I can see past my belly, okay?

1407
00:47:19,580 --> 00:47:21,580
(laughing)

1408
00:47:21,580 --> 00:47:23,180
- Do you have a greasy dick?

1409
00:47:23,180 --> 00:47:25,700
- Hey, I may have a big gainer belly,

1410
00:47:25,700 --> 00:47:27,340
but you can see my cock.

1411
00:47:27,340 --> 00:47:30,860
- I have a stripe of hair down the top of my dick,

1412
00:47:30,860 --> 00:47:33,180
like a dog that has a wolf in its DNA.

1413
00:47:33,180 --> 00:47:34,220
- I would think scum.

1414
00:47:34,220 --> 00:47:35,700
- You know when they have a black stripe,

1415
00:47:35,700 --> 00:47:37,500
and you go, that's a killer dog.

1416
00:47:37,500 --> 00:47:39,820
- Hackles, your dick has hackles.

1417
00:47:39,820 --> 00:47:42,300
- I've never looked at a dog's penis.

1418
00:47:42,300 --> 00:47:44,500
penis the fuck are you talking about?

1419
00:47:44,500 --> 00:47:45,500
A dog's back?

1420
00:47:45,500 --> 00:47:47,100
Did you drink some psychedelic water you crazy motherfucker?

1421
00:47:47,100 --> 00:47:48,780
Bro's obsessed with dog penis.

1422
00:47:48,780 --> 00:47:50,420
I'm obsessed with dog puss.

1423
00:47:50,420 --> 00:47:52,300
I'm obsessed with my dog's penis.

1424
00:47:52,300 --> 00:47:55,420
You know Stripe from Gremlins?

1425
00:47:55,420 --> 00:47:56,420
You know Stripe from Gremlins?

1426
00:47:56,420 --> 00:47:57,420
Yes I know the Gremlins.

1427
00:47:57,420 --> 00:47:58,420
I know all the Gremlins.

1428
00:47:58,420 --> 00:47:59,420
No you don't.

1429
00:47:59,420 --> 00:48:04,420
Stripe, food gremlin, electricity gremlin.

1430
00:48:04,420 --> 00:48:06,620
He's good.

1431
00:48:06,620 --> 00:48:10,300
I never realized that Mike from Breaking Bad is in there.

1432
00:48:10,300 --> 00:48:12,260
He's the police officer.

1433
00:48:12,260 --> 00:48:14,840
and you kind of fucking realize that his backstory

1434
00:48:14,840 --> 00:48:16,260
of being a cop in Breaking Bad,

1435
00:48:16,260 --> 00:48:18,660
it must have been when he was a cop fighting the gremlins.

1436
00:48:18,660 --> 00:48:22,260
- That's why he's so resourceful in Breaking Bad.

1437
00:48:22,260 --> 00:48:23,660
- Also he's sort of like Battlescar.

1438
00:48:23,660 --> 00:48:24,940
- Here's what you're gonna do.

1439
00:48:24,940 --> 00:48:26,020
- Walter.

1440
00:48:26,020 --> 00:48:27,020
- Do not put them in water.

1441
00:48:27,020 --> 00:48:29,340
- Do not put them in water.

1442
00:48:29,340 --> 00:48:31,700
- Wait, Walter.

1443
00:48:31,700 --> 00:48:34,020
- That's why he hates Walter so much.

1444
00:48:34,020 --> 00:48:37,020
- Yeah, I just don't like your name.

1445
00:48:37,020 --> 00:48:39,380
- You multiplied my friend, you bitch.

1446
00:48:39,380 --> 00:48:40,340
Here's what you're gonna do,

1447
00:48:40,340 --> 00:48:42,900
- So you're gonna feed them at 11.30 p.m.

1448
00:48:42,900 --> 00:48:44,140
so they don't get hungry.

1449
00:48:44,140 --> 00:48:45,420
- Not midnight.

1450
00:48:45,420 --> 00:48:46,380
- Not midnight.

1451
00:48:46,380 --> 00:48:48,700
- Not after midnight.

1452
00:48:48,700 --> 00:48:51,060
- When do you feed them damn things then?

1453
00:48:51,060 --> 00:48:52,380
- Yeah, any time other than,

1454
00:48:52,380 --> 00:48:54,180
yeah, I guess every time is after midnight.

1455
00:48:54,180 --> 00:48:55,540
- Shit.

1456
00:48:55,540 --> 00:48:57,620
- That is a wild thought.

1457
00:48:57,620 --> 00:48:59,460
- Here's a one day, definitely.

1458
00:48:59,460 --> 00:49:01,980
- I'm blowing his kava mind right now.

1459
00:49:01,980 --> 00:49:03,980
- Guys, my mind has been flattened.

1460
00:49:03,980 --> 00:49:05,740
I have, there's nothing left of me.

1461
00:49:05,740 --> 00:49:07,380
You know, I feel like nothing.

1462
00:49:07,380 --> 00:49:09,260
- You, I'm looking at your eyes right now,

1463
00:49:09,260 --> 00:49:10,860
- There is nothing behind there.

1464
00:49:10,860 --> 00:49:13,980
- Your eye is so red.

1465
00:49:13,980 --> 00:49:17,740
- Your eyes look normal.

1466
00:49:17,740 --> 00:49:19,980
(laughing)

1467
00:49:19,980 --> 00:49:26,380
His eyes look completely normal.

1468
00:49:26,380 --> 00:49:27,340
- No they don't.

1469
00:49:27,340 --> 00:49:37,660
- I got really scared, I just thought about.

1470
00:49:37,660 --> 00:49:39,900
(laughing)

1471
00:49:39,900 --> 00:49:51,240
- I just thought about space and how it's too big.

1472
00:49:51,240 --> 00:49:54,160
(laughing)

1473
00:49:54,160 --> 00:49:56,360
It really scares me at night.

1474
00:49:56,360 --> 00:49:57,720
Do you guys ever, when you're going to bed

1475
00:49:57,720 --> 00:49:59,480
and you think about how large the universe is,

1476
00:49:59,480 --> 00:50:01,680
you get up and you start punching your pillow?

1477
00:50:01,680 --> 00:50:04,660
- I've never thought about anything before I go to bed.

1478
00:50:06,240 --> 00:50:09,280
- See, me, my screen time is only in the tens of hours

1479
00:50:09,280 --> 00:50:11,360
per day and not the fucking hundreds.

1480
00:50:11,360 --> 00:50:13,960
So I actually have some time that I think to myself.

1481
00:50:13,960 --> 00:50:14,800
- Yeah.

1482
00:50:14,800 --> 00:50:16,080
- If I'm alone with my violence,

1483
00:50:16,080 --> 00:50:17,840
I think about death and where my grandparents

1484
00:50:17,840 --> 00:50:18,800
might be going soon.

1485
00:50:18,800 --> 00:50:23,320
- I keep seeing a black specter that's a coat's hanging up.

1486
00:50:23,320 --> 00:50:25,840
- I have had a seriously similar experience.

1487
00:50:25,840 --> 00:50:27,560
- I remember you telling me about it

1488
00:50:27,560 --> 00:50:29,880
and I didn't even open up about my experience

1489
00:50:29,880 --> 00:50:30,840
that has also been happening.

1490
00:50:30,840 --> 00:50:33,200
- So now let's talk about this because first of all,

1491
00:50:33,200 --> 00:50:34,040
can we just acknowledge--

1492
00:50:34,040 --> 00:50:36,600
- And we just felt two presences in the past few weeks.

1493
00:50:36,600 --> 00:50:38,280
- And can we just acknowledge right now,

1494
00:50:38,280 --> 00:50:39,360
this is creepy. - And you're about to feel

1495
00:50:39,360 --> 00:50:40,200
a third. - This is creepy.

1496
00:50:40,200 --> 00:50:42,200
Luckily we got it on camera.

1497
00:50:42,200 --> 00:50:44,340
Can you switch to this camera, please?

1498
00:50:44,340 --> 00:50:46,920
You have, and I don't mean to alarm you,

1499
00:50:46,920 --> 00:50:49,280
you have bones on your shirt.

1500
00:50:49,280 --> 00:50:51,200
That is a bone outfit.

1501
00:50:51,200 --> 00:50:52,960
And there's a bone spirit.

1502
00:50:52,960 --> 00:50:54,600
- Cam, Cam. - He's wearing a--

1503
00:50:54,600 --> 00:50:56,840
- There are two hands on your shoulder blades.

1504
00:50:56,840 --> 00:50:59,960
- I can't see them from here.

1505
00:50:59,960 --> 00:51:00,800
- This is a speedy-- - And I don't think

1506
00:51:00,800 --> 00:51:02,880
the camera will be able to see them either.

1507
00:51:02,880 --> 00:51:05,160
- And I'd just like to acknowledge how weird it is

1508
00:51:05,160 --> 00:51:08,480
that on all days, the day that we end up talking

1509
00:51:08,480 --> 00:51:09,640
about our spiritual experiences,

1510
00:51:09,640 --> 00:51:10,760
and just like kinda getting into it,

1511
00:51:10,760 --> 00:51:12,400
and we'll talk about it for the next 10 minutes or so.

1512
00:51:12,400 --> 00:51:13,400
- Yeah. - But,

1513
00:51:13,400 --> 00:51:15,800
you decided to wear a spirit Halloween shirt.

1514
00:51:15,800 --> 00:51:17,560
- I didn't decide to wear this.

1515
00:51:17,560 --> 00:51:19,600
I didn't even realize I was wearing this.

1516
00:51:19,600 --> 00:51:22,480
Okay, can I give you an actual rundown

1517
00:51:22,480 --> 00:51:23,880
of my spiritual experiences?

1518
00:51:23,880 --> 00:51:25,260
- Go one by one.

1519
00:51:25,260 --> 00:51:27,040
- Number one, I felt a presence

1520
00:51:27,040 --> 00:51:28,040
when I was standing right there,

1521
00:51:28,040 --> 00:51:30,240
and I turned around and there was nothing there,

1522
00:51:30,240 --> 00:51:31,540
and it scared me.

1523
00:51:31,540 --> 00:51:33,980
Number two, that door opened and closed.

1524
00:51:33,980 --> 00:51:37,300
We all saw that and we remember it and it happened on recording.

1525
00:51:37,300 --> 00:51:40,940
Number three, when we were walking from our lunch, or maybe to our lunch,

1526
00:51:40,940 --> 00:51:43,380
no, it was after our lunch, we were walking back to the car,

1527
00:51:43,380 --> 00:51:44,460
and I felt another presence.

1528
00:51:44,460 --> 00:51:47,300
And I went, "Oh my God," and I turned around, and you guys said,

1529
00:51:47,300 --> 00:51:48,580
"You're being weird."

1530
00:51:48,580 --> 00:51:50,580
And I said, "No, I felt a presence."

1531
00:51:50,580 --> 00:51:53,540
Number four was going on the whole time,

1532
00:51:53,540 --> 00:51:57,980
which is there's a jacket on the door that looks like a monster.

1533
00:51:57,980 --> 00:52:00,780
- I think that you're being followed by a monster.

1534
00:52:00,780 --> 00:52:02,200
(laughing)

1535
00:52:02,200 --> 00:52:04,300
- The jacket looks like a monster at night?

1536
00:52:04,300 --> 00:52:06,860
- At night, when I can see it from my bedroom.

1537
00:52:06,860 --> 00:52:07,700
- Do you ever put--

1538
00:52:07,700 --> 00:52:12,500
- At number five is, soon the world will end.

1539
00:52:12,500 --> 00:52:14,300
- Wow, that is really haunting.

1540
00:52:14,300 --> 00:52:15,940
I do hate that when stuff at night

1541
00:52:15,940 --> 00:52:17,660
starts to take a weird form,

1542
00:52:17,660 --> 00:52:20,260
where like maybe you'll hang up a dress

1543
00:52:20,260 --> 00:52:22,740
and then you'll put like a jack-o-lantern on top of it.

1544
00:52:22,740 --> 00:52:23,580
(laughing)

1545
00:52:23,580 --> 00:52:26,180
And then some bony hands coming out of the side.

1546
00:52:26,180 --> 00:52:27,900
And you'll walk out of the bathroom at night

1547
00:52:27,900 --> 00:52:34,640
You're all tired. You go. Oh fuck me. Oh, just my jacket. I dress am I my gloves and my knife. I have guns

1548
00:52:34,640 --> 00:52:40,460
I have gotten scared. I've got scared so many fucking times by my taxidermied silverback gorilla

1549
00:52:40,460 --> 00:52:47,000
Yeah, I get it that's scary man. I turn I go into the kitchen you to eat a few women. Yeah

1550
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:51,140
For a yeah when you and your woman make love I keep fucking seeing them

1551
00:52:51,140 --> 00:52:54,440
At my Christmas tree. I keep seeing them in my cabinet

1552
00:52:55,860 --> 00:53:02,840
Speaking speaking of your giant taxidermy and silverback when you and your woman make love do you like kind of put your hand over and like

1553
00:53:02,840 --> 00:53:07,340
Just flatten it so that it doesn't watch. I know this crazy silverback. Yeah, yeah

1554
00:53:07,340 --> 00:53:12,260
Yeah, this crazy sick mofo putting a suction cup dildo on that thing bringing them in as a third

1555
00:53:12,260 --> 00:53:16,340
I don't need to put a suction cup dildo on it has a penis you filled up the penis

1556
00:53:16,340 --> 00:53:24,380
You filled up your be a gorillas have tiny penises oh, yeah, which is perfect for my depth cuz I

1557
00:53:25,060 --> 00:53:29,760
I don't want to turn off any potential gay fans who have a crush, but I can't really

1558
00:53:29,760 --> 00:53:31,240
take it back there.

1559
00:53:31,240 --> 00:53:43,860
You're blowing my monkey mind today.

1560
00:53:43,860 --> 00:53:46,540
I've been sent back to the Stone Age.

1561
00:53:46,540 --> 00:53:47,540
Is that its penis?

1562
00:53:47,540 --> 00:53:49,180
No, they're really, really small.

1563
00:53:49,180 --> 00:53:50,180
Yeah, they're microscopic.

1564
00:53:50,180 --> 00:53:53,420
- I believe they have the smallest penis to body ratio

1565
00:53:53,420 --> 00:53:55,100
of a primate.

1566
00:53:55,100 --> 00:53:56,180
- Is that its penis?

1567
00:53:56,180 --> 00:53:57,460
- No, it's probably penis is,

1568
00:53:57,460 --> 00:53:59,300
just search gorilla penis and really show it.

1569
00:53:59,300 --> 00:54:02,460
- That gorilla's penis is big and purple.

1570
00:54:02,460 --> 00:54:04,380
- That's a ball that it's holding.

1571
00:54:04,380 --> 00:54:06,060
That's not even visible on screen.

1572
00:54:06,060 --> 00:54:07,620
- Dumb as an apple.

1573
00:54:07,620 --> 00:54:12,260
- I've seen this picture probably a hundred times.

1574
00:54:12,260 --> 00:54:14,620
- Yeah, a hundred times.

1575
00:54:14,620 --> 00:54:16,620
- Yeah, probably a hundred, a hundred and fifty times.

1576
00:54:16,620 --> 00:54:18,700
- I don't think you're gonna find a gorilla penis today.

1577
00:54:18,700 --> 00:54:20,180
- Yeah, you have to turn safe search off

1578
00:54:20,180 --> 00:54:21,020
or search on something else.

1579
00:54:21,020 --> 00:54:21,860
- You gotta go on Bing, bro.

1580
00:54:21,860 --> 00:54:23,200
- Go on Bing, yeah.

1581
00:54:23,200 --> 00:54:25,240
- You gotta check out Gorilla Penis on Bing.

1582
00:54:25,240 --> 00:54:26,160
- But in the meantime, though,

1583
00:54:26,160 --> 00:54:28,940
which taxidermy animal would you throw it back on?

1584
00:54:28,940 --> 00:54:30,200
- Ooh, that's a good question.

1585
00:54:30,200 --> 00:54:31,640
- Probably a raccoon.

1586
00:54:31,640 --> 00:54:32,940
- Raquel Welch.

1587
00:54:32,940 --> 00:54:35,020
- What's that?

1588
00:54:35,020 --> 00:54:37,040
- I don't know, it just said she died.

1589
00:54:37,040 --> 00:54:37,880
- Oh, this is not what I was looking for.

1590
00:54:37,880 --> 00:54:39,160
- Okay, so don't show this stuff either.

1591
00:54:39,160 --> 00:54:40,760
- Yeah, no, this is all--

1592
00:54:40,760 --> 00:54:42,200
- That is furry porn.

1593
00:54:42,200 --> 00:54:43,920
- I'll try this in the picture.

1594
00:54:43,920 --> 00:54:46,560
- These are definitely, there's some creative liberties

1595
00:54:46,560 --> 00:54:48,400
are being taken with these photos.

1596
00:54:48,400 --> 00:54:52,560
Gorilla's penis is definitely way smaller than that, from what Cameron's told me.

1597
00:54:52,560 --> 00:54:53,920
And also it doesn't go into...

1598
00:54:53,920 --> 00:54:55,760
That's just a guy's ass!

1599
00:54:55,760 --> 00:54:57,280
Yeah, it's not a gorilla.

1600
00:54:57,280 --> 00:55:13,120
[Laughter]

1601
00:55:13,120 --> 00:55:16,240
Did you search "white girl having sex with monkey"?

1602
00:55:16,240 --> 00:55:18,000
No, that just came up.

1603
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:20,240
(laughing)

1604
00:55:20,240 --> 00:55:21,080
- Oh no.

1605
00:55:21,080 --> 00:55:21,920
- That's awful.

1606
00:55:21,920 --> 00:55:22,740
- That's horrible.

1607
00:55:22,740 --> 00:55:24,580
- Yeah, no, that's not.

1608
00:55:24,580 --> 00:55:27,580
I don't want it to be a part of this anymore, Jubio.

1609
00:55:27,580 --> 00:55:29,840
- Yeah, Jubio, you kinda ruined everything.

1610
00:55:29,840 --> 00:55:30,680
- That's what he does, man.

1611
00:55:30,680 --> 00:55:32,880
He's so shit at his job, man.

1612
00:55:32,880 --> 00:55:36,800
- I'm surprised by how easily he can completely ruin.

1613
00:55:36,800 --> 00:55:38,320
He knows exactly the thing to click on

1614
00:55:38,320 --> 00:55:40,200
that makes me never wanna talk about

1615
00:55:40,200 --> 00:55:41,040
whatever we're talking about again.

1616
00:55:41,040 --> 00:55:42,440
- He's just terrible.

1617
00:55:42,440 --> 00:55:43,600
He's just so bad at his job.

1618
00:55:43,600 --> 00:55:45,400
- Oh, we do have a sponsor to have for Chewy, though.

1619
00:55:45,400 --> 00:55:47,440
- Oh, actually, Jubio.

1620
00:55:47,440 --> 00:55:50,700
Actually, we have been very helpful for me. Yeah, food

1621
00:55:50,700 --> 00:55:58,200
Don't type anything. Fuck you. Fuck you the pet store that I go to keeps running out of Moe's food so chewy

1622
00:55:58,200 --> 00:56:05,320
There we spot we can tell you dermy Jubio. Oh my god. Yeah, we only had he only has button micro

1623
00:56:05,320 --> 00:56:10,640
He'd be so much better at his job if we just fully taxidermy. Yeah, and just put him there, and he's just

1624
00:56:10,640 --> 00:56:14,220
Yeah, just kind of looking yeah, we would hands up like a bear

1625
00:56:14,220 --> 00:56:17,860
- (laughs) Taxidermy him exactly like a bear

1626
00:56:17,860 --> 00:56:18,880
and put him in the office.

1627
00:56:18,880 --> 00:56:20,380
- You can put fangs on his fingers.

1628
00:56:20,380 --> 00:56:22,420
- Can I get a nod to your head yes?

1629
00:56:22,420 --> 00:56:24,440
If you die, can we do that to you?

1630
00:56:24,440 --> 00:56:27,100
- If you die, you're not gonna do--

1631
00:56:27,100 --> 00:56:28,540
- No, not when you're alive.

1632
00:56:28,540 --> 00:56:29,620
- Well, everyone saw that he nodded.

1633
00:56:29,620 --> 00:56:30,460
- Yeah, I saw it.

1634
00:56:30,460 --> 00:56:31,280
- We all saw it, right?

1635
00:56:31,280 --> 00:56:32,420
- Yeah, hold your phone sideways.

1636
00:56:32,420 --> 00:56:33,740
He's nodding.

1637
00:56:33,740 --> 00:56:34,580
- He's nodding.

1638
00:56:34,580 --> 00:56:35,420
- He is nodding.

1639
00:56:35,420 --> 00:56:37,260
- That is express permission.

1640
00:56:37,260 --> 00:56:39,100
This jacket on my door, it's terrifying.

1641
00:56:39,100 --> 00:56:40,660
It looks like a cloaked ghost

1642
00:56:40,660 --> 00:56:42,900
and I'm terrified to take it off of my door.

1643
00:56:42,900 --> 00:56:43,740
- Cloaked?

1644
00:56:43,740 --> 00:56:44,580
- It's crooked, yeah.

1645
00:56:44,580 --> 00:56:45,700
- Why won't you just take it off?

1646
00:56:45,700 --> 00:56:49,580
- Because this jacket is on the front door, okay?

1647
00:56:49,580 --> 00:56:51,680
I can see from my bed, the way my bed is,

1648
00:56:51,680 --> 00:56:52,800
I see it out my bedroom door

1649
00:56:52,800 --> 00:56:54,460
to the front door of the apartment.

1650
00:56:54,460 --> 00:56:56,360
If I take the jacket off, then I'll just see the door

1651
00:56:56,360 --> 00:56:57,880
and I'll get scared that it's gonna open.

1652
00:56:57,880 --> 00:56:58,720
- Yeah.

1653
00:56:58,720 --> 00:56:59,660
- You are a baby.

1654
00:56:59,660 --> 00:57:01,940
- Dude, I got so freaked out last night,

1655
00:57:01,940 --> 00:57:04,520
or two nights ago, speaking of,

1656
00:57:04,520 --> 00:57:06,420
I thought that my door was going to open

1657
00:57:06,420 --> 00:57:09,060
because I heard out, like in front of my apartment,

1658
00:57:09,060 --> 00:57:10,620
I heard just a guy go, "Help!"

1659
00:57:12,580 --> 00:57:15,980
and i i woke up to it and i thought like oh my god

1660
00:57:15,980 --> 00:57:18,800
there's a guy is like six in the morning

1661
00:57:18,800 --> 00:57:20,620
woke up and i thought immediately

1662
00:57:20,620 --> 00:57:23,720
there's a guy going around people's houses

1663
00:57:23,720 --> 00:57:26,580
and he's breaking in and he's killing everyone

1664
00:57:26,580 --> 00:57:30,320
and i like uh... the pete the fear paralyzed me i couldn't get out of my

1665
00:57:30,320 --> 00:57:31,660
bed

1666
00:57:31,660 --> 00:57:35,420
so i'll but i knew is just uh... like a homeless guy yelling do you know what

1667
00:57:35,420 --> 00:57:36,420
you should do

1668
00:57:36,420 --> 00:57:40,480
there's a whole issue content by my apartment you should call on one are l

1669
00:57:40,480 --> 00:57:42,380
stein

1670
00:57:42,380 --> 00:57:44,660
'cause I don't think R.L. Stine has done any books

1671
00:57:44,660 --> 00:57:46,380
called The Homeless Horror or something.

1672
00:57:46,380 --> 00:57:47,540
- Yeah, The Homeless Screamer.

1673
00:57:47,540 --> 00:57:48,380
- Yeah. - Yeah.

1674
00:57:48,380 --> 00:57:49,380
- Yeah.

1675
00:57:49,380 --> 00:57:50,900
- He would do a clever one, though.

1676
00:57:50,900 --> 00:57:53,100
- Yeah, well, yeah, it would be like--

1677
00:57:53,100 --> 00:57:56,980
- It would be an allegory. - Homeless where the heart

1678
00:57:56,980 --> 00:57:58,300
isn't-- - It'd be called

1679
00:57:58,300 --> 00:58:00,020
A Voice for the Voiceless. - Takes my heart.

1680
00:58:00,020 --> 00:58:01,100
- Yeah. - And it would be

1681
00:58:01,100 --> 00:58:03,340
a screaming homeless guy. - Or it would be right.

1682
00:58:03,340 --> 00:58:05,900
There was one, I think it's the same guy, I'm not sure,

1683
00:58:05,900 --> 00:58:09,820
but I heard him walk by my house and go like--

1684
00:58:09,820 --> 00:58:10,780
- R.L. Stine?

1685
00:58:10,780 --> 00:58:12,780
Yeah, I heard R.L. Stine walk by my house.

1686
00:58:12,780 --> 00:58:15,220
He was going, "I'm going to scare so many people today."

1687
00:58:15,220 --> 00:58:19,300
He walked by and he said, "The next person I see is getting fucking stabbed."

1688
00:58:19,300 --> 00:58:21,100
He would do that.

1689
00:58:21,100 --> 00:58:22,620
Do you guys remember when we were in Portland

1690
00:58:22,620 --> 00:58:24,660
and the guy was going to kill that guy with the machete?

1691
00:58:24,660 --> 00:58:25,340
Yeah.

1692
00:58:25,340 --> 00:58:27,820
I think about that a lot and I think if he ever did that.

1693
00:58:27,820 --> 00:58:30,180
We never talked about that.

1694
00:58:30,180 --> 00:58:31,740
I think we did a little bit.

1695
00:58:31,740 --> 00:58:32,740
He walked by.

1696
00:58:32,740 --> 00:58:34,980
We talked about it at the live show.

1697
00:58:34,980 --> 00:58:35,460
Oh, yeah.

1698
00:58:35,460 --> 00:58:37,740
There was a guy with a chain too that I saw.

1699
00:58:37,740 --> 00:58:38,380
Oh, that dude was scary.

1700
00:58:38,380 --> 00:58:42,400
I went out when you guys were napping together and I didn't that weird detail

1701
00:58:42,400 --> 00:58:46,980
We didn't have to not nap together. There's the only reason that I would be out walking alone

1702
00:58:46,980 --> 00:58:50,560
Okay, but you didn't have to say when you guys were napping together. It doesn't matter

1703
00:58:50,560 --> 00:58:53,740
What do you want if I say anything else it will seem like I'm a weird loner

1704
00:58:53,740 --> 00:58:58,120
But you're making us sound like a friend and by the way we were in separate beds

1705
00:58:58,120 --> 00:59:01,720
Yeah, well you were napping together. There was it wasn't in the hotel

1706
00:59:01,720 --> 00:59:03,320
And there was a guy dragging a chain

1707
00:59:03,320 --> 00:59:08,240
But that we were anyone and he wanted to say hello to me we were in Portland and we were walking to a bar

1708
00:59:08,240 --> 00:59:10,120
- A coffin club.

1709
00:59:10,120 --> 00:59:10,960
- Yeah, and a guy--

1710
00:59:10,960 --> 00:59:13,040
- We were in court space also.

1711
00:59:13,040 --> 00:59:15,380
That's just a little detail that makes the story

1712
00:59:15,380 --> 00:59:16,320
a little fun. - We already looked dead.

1713
00:59:16,320 --> 00:59:18,920
We were walking and two guys are getting in some kind

1714
00:59:18,920 --> 00:59:21,760
of F word argument where they're screaming at each other.

1715
00:59:21,760 --> 00:59:26,240
And then the big fat guy walked away and walked by us

1716
00:59:26,240 --> 00:59:27,960
and we kind of all like, you know,

1717
00:59:27,960 --> 00:59:30,240
try to not make eye contact with this guy.

1718
00:59:30,240 --> 00:59:31,440
And it's one of those things where, you know,

1719
00:59:31,440 --> 00:59:34,480
when you're walking with people and you're talking

1720
00:59:34,480 --> 00:59:36,320
and then you all overhear the same thing

1721
00:59:36,320 --> 00:59:38,760
and just stop talking completely, it was that.

1722
00:59:38,760 --> 00:59:41,040
And so we had completely stopped talking.

1723
00:59:41,040 --> 00:59:42,560
- Or you do the little-- - And this giant guy

1724
00:59:42,560 --> 00:59:44,400
walked by and looked at us. - The little conversation

1725
00:59:44,400 --> 00:59:45,600
to make it seem like you're not sharing.

1726
00:59:45,600 --> 00:59:47,040
- Yeah, you just go like, "Oh, yeah."

1727
00:59:47,040 --> 00:59:48,720
- Oh, they put a new building here.

1728
00:59:48,720 --> 00:59:51,240
- Yeah. (laughing)

1729
00:59:51,240 --> 00:59:54,540
And then the guy looked at us and he was like,

1730
00:59:54,540 --> 00:59:56,600
"Have you ever seen somebody get fucking killed

1731
00:59:56,600 --> 00:59:57,860
"with a machete?

1732
00:59:57,860 --> 00:59:59,780
"Stick around!"

1733
00:59:59,780 --> 01:00:01,160
And we were like, "Ugh!"

1734
01:00:01,160 --> 01:00:02,520
- And then we went to the gothic club.

1735
01:00:02,520 --> 01:00:04,340
- We didn't stick around, but I kinda wanted to

1736
01:00:04,340 --> 01:00:08,980
have a kind of a chicken fight betting yeah just throwing money down yeah oh

1737
01:00:08,980 --> 01:00:14,660
there's also a guy with a laser gun - yeah I remember that there was remember it we

1738
01:00:14,660 --> 01:00:19,900
were in LA and that guy we were crossing the street on the Hollywood on Hollywood

1739
01:00:19,900 --> 01:00:24,620
Boulevard and that guy had like a skateboard like really broken one it was

1740
01:00:24,620 --> 01:00:29,620
just like jabbing people in the fucking chest with it no you don't remember that

1741
01:00:29,620 --> 01:00:34,060
he I do he tried to he hit you in the sternum with his skateboard and then hit

1742
01:00:34,060 --> 01:00:41,060
an old man and the old man stopped in the middle of the road and just went "What a prick!"

1743
01:00:41,060 --> 01:00:45,720
"What a prick!" He kept doing that. That guy's cool. Yeah. But you don't remember that? He

1744
01:00:45,720 --> 01:00:50,240
hit you in the chest. Maybe you blacked out from anger. I probably blacked out from pain.

1745
01:00:50,240 --> 01:00:55,420
I probably hurt too bad and I fully blacked out. Yeah, he's just walking around just fucking

1746
01:00:55,420 --> 01:01:00,860
like, with a bayonet style. I do think living in a city makes you crazy no matter what if

1747
01:01:00,860 --> 01:01:02,460
- You stay in there long enough.

1748
01:01:02,460 --> 01:01:04,080
- I mean Portland, Los Angeles,

1749
01:01:04,080 --> 01:01:06,860
these are two places with the craziest people on Earth.

1750
01:01:06,860 --> 01:01:09,740
- I think that this kava might be opening my mind

1751
01:01:09,740 --> 01:01:11,740
to sort of a different social ills.

1752
01:01:11,740 --> 01:01:13,060
And I might be realizing right now

1753
01:01:13,060 --> 01:01:15,100
that New York City is a disease

1754
01:01:15,100 --> 01:01:17,660
and needs to be wiped off the face of the planet Earth.

1755
01:01:17,660 --> 01:01:19,500
- Yeah.

1756
01:01:19,500 --> 01:01:21,060
- But I'll figure that out on my own time.

1757
01:01:21,060 --> 01:01:21,900
- That'll happen.

1758
01:01:21,900 --> 01:01:22,740
- You know.

1759
01:01:22,740 --> 01:01:24,260
- Yeah.

1760
01:01:24,260 --> 01:01:25,180
Whatever.

1761
01:01:25,180 --> 01:01:26,180
- Who gives a shit?

1762
01:01:26,180 --> 01:01:27,020
- Who cares?

1763
01:01:27,020 --> 01:01:28,620
- Should we just all three kill ourselves?

1764
01:01:28,620 --> 01:01:29,460
- Yeah.

1765
01:01:29,460 --> 01:01:30,280
- I think that's a good idea.

1766
01:01:30,280 --> 01:01:32,600
Turn the lights off, we're gonna slit our wrists.

1767
01:01:32,600 --> 01:01:34,920
Yeah, I don't want anyone to see this.

1768
01:01:34,920 --> 01:01:36,280
Yeah, wait, yeah, turn these off,

1769
01:01:36,280 --> 01:01:37,120
and then we'll slow 'em.

1770
01:01:37,120 --> 01:01:38,640
I don't want anyone to see us kill ourselves.

1771
01:01:38,640 --> 01:01:40,760
All right, here we go, ready?

1772
01:01:40,760 --> 01:01:42,760
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow.

1773
01:01:42,760 --> 01:01:44,280
Don't you, you ruined it.

1774
01:01:44,280 --> 01:01:45,760
Why'd you-- You ruined the whole bit.

1775
01:01:45,760 --> 01:01:47,200
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow.

1776
01:01:47,200 --> 01:01:48,360
Okay, now we're really doing it.

1777
01:01:48,360 --> 01:01:49,440
Ow, ow, ow, ow.

1778
01:01:49,440 --> 01:01:50,320
God, it hurt. Jesus.

1779
01:01:50,320 --> 01:01:51,160
Oh, Jesus.

1780
01:01:51,160 --> 01:01:52,480
Oh, God, wait, Jesus.

1781
01:01:52,480 --> 01:01:53,680
I didn't know it was gonna do that.

1782
01:01:53,680 --> 01:01:54,560
Oh, crap.

1783
01:01:54,560 --> 01:01:56,720
It feels kinda good. It actually feels good, yeah.

1784
01:01:56,720 --> 01:01:57,720
Whoa.

1785
01:01:57,720 --> 01:01:59,720
Am I the only one that thinks this feels kinda nice?

1786
01:01:59,720 --> 01:02:01,720
It actually feels fucking amazing!

1787
01:02:01,720 --> 01:02:03,720
Yo!

1788
01:02:03,720 --> 01:02:05,720
Yo!

1789
01:02:05,720 --> 01:02:07,720
