Okay.

21
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:52,040
By the way, I started a TikTok.

22
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:53,040
You did?

23
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:54,040
You started a TikTok?

24
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:55,040
Yeah, you want to see my TikTok?

25
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:58,320
There's a guy doing a, he does a tail whip on a scooter down El Toro.

26
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:01,320
I saw, Tailwhip is pretty good against Onyx.

27
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:05,440
I accidentally uploaded my TikTok twice because it said it didn't upload and then it actually

28
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:07,800
did upload and it completely fucking lied to me.

29
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:09,040
What is your, what's your account?

00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:14,040
It's pretty good.

35
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:21,040

36
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:29,480

You pick your favorite song.

43
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:47,180
That's so fucking stupid.

44
00:01:47,180 --> 00:01:49,180
Today I don't feel like doing...

45
00:01:49,180 --> 00:01:51,180
I love Bruno Mars. I like his outfits and his hat.

46
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:53,180
Today I don't feel like...

47
00:01:53,180 --> 00:01:55,180
And honestly, I made that yesterday

48
00:01:55,180 --> 00:01:57,180
and I was just telling you about how bad I felt yesterday.

49
00:01:57,180 --> 00:01:59,180
So it was like completely true to life.

50
00:01:59,180 --> 00:02:01,180
Like I was not doing any kind of acting.

51
00:02:01,180 --> 00:02:03,180
I completely felt like,

52
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:05,180
Today I don't feel like doing anything.

53
00:02:05,180 --> 00:02:07,180
Yeah.

54
00:02:07,180 --> 00:02:09,180
Imagine... Well, I don't know what word of these songs

55
00:02:09,180 --> 00:02:12,700
songs came out, but if you were like say you were you were like dating Bruno

56
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:17,180
Mars right, so imagine that that might be tough for you to imagine but but

57
00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:22,620
he releases this song grenade and he's saying I would catch a grenade for you.

58
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:26,220
I would jump in front of a train for you. I doing a version all these and then

59
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:29,420
and then and then it's next and you're like oh my God, he loves me so much and

60
00:02:29,420 --> 00:02:32,620
a month later releases a new song today. I don't feel like doing anything yeah

61
00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:36,620
because he got hit by a train and he jumped on a grenade. Yeah right. It's

62
00:02:36,620 --> 00:02:37,460
- That's true.

63
00:02:37,460 --> 00:02:38,280
- Does Bruno Mars still make music?

64
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:39,120
- You don't wanna do any,

65
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:40,620
you don't even wanna catch some grenade for me anymore?

66
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:43,620
- Bruno Mars does all this Super Bowl shit now.

67
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:44,460
- Football?

68
00:02:44,460 --> 00:02:48,220
- He does all this like performing at the Super Bowl.

69
00:02:48,220 --> 00:02:50,460
I think the last time I ever heard,

70
00:02:50,460 --> 00:02:52,820
no, Bruno Mars does still make music.

71
00:02:52,820 --> 00:02:54,980
He had that really good song last year.

72
00:02:54,980 --> 00:02:56,380
- He has brunomars.com?

73
00:02:56,380 --> 00:02:57,220

75

76
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:01,940
That does look like a Bruno Mars music video though.

77
00:03:01,940 --> 00:03:02,780
- Yeah.

78
00:03:02,780 --> 00:03:03,620

79
00:03:03,620 --> 00:03:04,440

♪ Don't believe me just watch ♪

82
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:10,780
in Bruno Mars to help you not do anything, the lazy song I learned it's called.

83
00:03:10,780 --> 00:03:15,540
Is it does he am I am I tripping or does he make the music video and he's hanging

84
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:20,300
out with a bunch of monkeys? I don't remember. Monkeys wearing business suits is it that one?

85
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:25,060
I think that might be it. I learned the other day. I'm thinking of that Pulp Fiction poster with the two monkeys.

86
00:03:25,060 --> 00:03:29,540
He has an album cover with a gorilla on it. Somebody told me the other day that

87
00:03:29,540 --> 00:03:35,420
you know that song "gold all on my watch" that one? That Trinidad James song?

88
00:03:35,420 --> 00:03:36,500
- "Trinidad James." - "All Gold Everything."

89
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:37,460
- Yeah. - Yeah.

90
00:03:37,460 --> 00:03:40,380
So because he says, "Don't believe me, just watch,"

91
00:03:40,380 --> 00:03:42,180
he's credited as a writer.

92
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:43,780
- Well, that's not really how it worked.

93
00:03:43,780 --> 00:03:46,060
The guy, Mark Johnson or whatever--

94
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:47,340
- Ronson? - Mark Ronson,

95
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:48,780
the other guy in that song,

96
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:50,300
is friends with "Trinidad James,"

97
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:53,060
and he said, "And 'Trinidad James' had like no money,"

98
00:03:53,060 --> 00:03:53,900
'cause he blew all of his money from his one-and-one.

99
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:54,980
- Oh, is that how it is? - And he was like,

100
00:03:54,980 --> 00:03:57,660
"Here, I'll put you as a credit on this song,

101
00:03:57,660 --> 00:03:59,660
"and we'll put 'Don't Believe Me, Just Watch' in it."

102
00:03:59,660 --> 00:04:00,940
- I have a credit on that song, too.

103
00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:04,980
of me too because they say the yeah really - for the only one who doesn't

104
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:08,260
have a credit on that fucking song yeah not the only one in my world but in

105
00:04:08,260 --> 00:04:12,980
this room close to it that's like a being having be having dinner with Jay-z

106
00:04:12,980 --> 00:04:18,660
and being like am I the only like guy in here is not the first black billionaire

107
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:25,100
what is he the first black billionaire I think I would assume so that there's a

108
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:34,380
Bill Gates. What? What the fuck are you talking about? Bill Gates. What? What? He's a black guy.

109
00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:39,180
Bill Gates isn't black. Bill Gates is white as snow. Bill Gates is a white guy.

110
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:43,700
Yeah. You look at that guy and you think that that's a white guy. Dude, he's a honky.

111
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:49,020
You think that's a honky. He's a complete honky. He's a peckerwood. Look at him.

112
00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:54,100
I don't think... peckerwood is not... peckerwood only applies in jail, I thought.

113
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:59,560
I don't think so. I think it is. I think that's only a jail. And I think he should

114
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:05,740
be in jail. For what? Microchipping? Mm-hmm. No, micro-stofting is what he did. Oh,

115
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:10,820
you're right. I was thinking of microchipper. No, no, the microchipper does that. He's the

116
00:05:10,820 --> 00:05:14,700
king of micro-stofting. Wait a minute, hold on, hold on. Why is the microchipper wearing

117
00:05:14,700 --> 00:05:21,100
glasses? What? What? Like Bill Gates? I don't understand what you're saying. I think under

118
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:25,100
his mask the much or do you think it might be Bill Gates yeah you said that

119
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:28,900
like Bill Gates like glasses or is like Bill Gates is thing it is this thing

120
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:32,580
he's a nerd I don't think it's a black nerd is the first black nerd billion

121
00:05:32,580 --> 00:05:37,140
there's Microsoft Bill Gates is the first black nerd billionaire did Steve Steve

122
00:05:37,140 --> 00:05:42,460
Jobs and Bill Gates do they have beef they did really yeah Steve job they had

123
00:05:42,460 --> 00:05:49,260
apples one of them had an apple I'm gonna put you know I'm putting you know

124
00:05:49,260 --> 00:05:51,500
- You know what, I'm off today because I--

125
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:52,340
- You're off today?

126
00:05:52,340 --> 00:05:56,180
- I forgot that we were recording and I found,

127
00:05:56,180 --> 00:06:01,180
it's a Guinness Nitro Cold Brew, and I had a day beer.

128
00:06:01,180 --> 00:06:04,020
- Day beer will ruin your shit.

129
00:06:04,020 --> 00:06:04,860
- Yeah.

130
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:05,860
- Day beer can fuck you up, man.

131
00:06:05,860 --> 00:06:10,060
- I think to fix this, we should all go get day beers.

132
00:06:10,060 --> 00:06:11,160
- I don't think so.

133
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:14,000
- I don't, I mean, I don't hate the idea,

134
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:14,840
but we'd have to pause.

135
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:16,340
- We could pause and then we all go on a little--

136
00:06:16,340 --> 00:06:17,180
- I don't wanna do that.

137
00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:19,220
- We all go on a little field trip.

138
00:06:19,220 --> 00:06:20,220
I don't want to go on a mid episode.

139
00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:22,980
Wouldn't it be kind of funny if we were like, "Okay, we'll be right back," and then it just

140
00:06:22,980 --> 00:06:24,620
started with cracking noises?

141
00:06:24,620 --> 00:06:26,620
Wouldn't that be kind of funny?

142
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:27,620
That'd be awesome.

143
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:28,620
I don't know if it would be funny.

144
00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:29,620
That would be so awesome.

145
00:06:29,620 --> 00:06:30,620
We live so close to a bodega.

146
00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:32,620
You spoiled it.

147
00:06:32,620 --> 00:06:35,100
Now we have to think about a different funny noise to start with.

148
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:36,100
Okay, all right.

149
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:40,660
We'll still have the crack, but we'll say a different thing.

150
00:06:40,660 --> 00:06:41,660
We'll come up.

151
00:06:41,660 --> 00:06:42,660
We can come up with something.

152
00:06:42,660 --> 00:06:43,660
We have a-- We'll come up with something.

153
00:06:43,660 --> 00:06:45,860
It'll take five minutes to go get beers and then come back, and then you'll hear--

154
00:06:45,860 --> 00:06:46,860
I'm so tired.

155
00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:47,860
I'm so tired.

156
00:06:47,860 --> 00:06:48,860
We'll get beers.

mod on yeah you think it's hard to do that I don't I don't know guys I just

169
00:08:15,980 --> 00:08:26,340
got a call from Spotify calling back oh my god okay pick up okay hello I was

170
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:33,980
told to get off the phone I apologize about that I got told to get off the

171
00:08:33,980 --> 00:08:37,060
- I'm on the phone, what's going on?

172
00:08:37,060 --> 00:08:39,580
- Oh no, yeah, I was just trying to reach Patrick.

173
00:08:39,580 --> 00:08:41,080
Is this Patrick up?

174
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:43,200
- Yes.

175
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,760
- Yeah.

176
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:46,240
- Oh, okay.

177
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:49,660
Well, I travel with this 30 year old macaw bird.

178
00:08:49,660 --> 00:08:52,500
He goes everywhere with me, never leaves.

179
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:55,240
The 18 wheeler, and I was hoping to maybe put

180
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:59,080
like some louvers in the window on his area, you know?

181
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:02,480
Maybe like a visor, and I could just use a hand with it.

182
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:05,400
Yeah, I could help out.

183
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:07,400
Oh, great.

184
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:11,400
Great, great. Yeah, I'll let you pick the farm and everything.

185
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:13,400
I was hoping to make it say Nicodemus.

186
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:15,400
That's his name, you know?

187
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:20,400
Like maybe an old English style lettering, like a tattoo almost, you know?

188
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:22,400
Something like that would be sweet.

189
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:24,400
Yeah.

190
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:25,400
I should warn you though.

191
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:27,400
Nico, that's what I call him,

192
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:29,400
he will talk like wild.

193
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:30,400
He'll talk to you.

194
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:32,400
He'll talk like wild.

195
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:35,400
And he'll communicate great.

196
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:36,400
This guy's gotta be joking.

197
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:37,400
So uh...

198
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:39,400
It's totally full of crap.

199
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:41,400
This guy talks fucking crazy.

200
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:42,400
Who the fuck is this?

201
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:43,400
It's so confusing.

202
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:44,400
Is he on the phone with an animal?

203
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:45,400
Hello?

204
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:50,400
And if you play like a gulag station on the radio, that bird will sing like wah-wah-wah.

205
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:52,400
How does he do that?

206
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:53,400
What is he doing?

207
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:54,400
What is this bullshit?

208
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:55,400
And this...

209
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:58,400
A gong gong gong a bing gong gong gong a bing a gong.

210
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:00,400
Oh my god, is that T-Pain?

211
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:07,400
and

212
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:09,960
You wanna go with a nano carbon tint on there?

213
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:10,800
What do you think?

214
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:11,620
Or maybe--

215
00:10:11,620 --> 00:10:14,200
- I could do a nano carbon tint.

216
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:16,640
- Perfect, that's what I was thinking.

217
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:17,660
That's what I was thinking.

218
00:10:17,660 --> 00:10:20,740
I always do a deep dip on the pigment.

219
00:10:20,740 --> 00:10:25,040
Maybe with a ceramic infused variant.

220
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:27,740
Like Big Red had our neighbor here.

221
00:10:27,740 --> 00:10:29,560
He's got the same thing.

222
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:31,980
- It might not be tea, it's not got hip hop.

223
00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:33,900
- How much butter?

224
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:34,920
- How much sputter?

225
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:35,760
- Sputter?

226
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:37,720
- Yeah, sputter. - Personally, I don't know

227
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:39,600
why Patrick's giving him the time of day.

228
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:42,000
- I know, it's probably a scam call.

229
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:47,000
- I like copper, so maybe some copper sputtering.

230
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:47,960
- Copper sputtering?

231
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:51,540
I got two tons of copper sputtering.

232
00:10:51,540 --> 00:10:54,600
- What the hell, what is Patrick even talking about?

233
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:56,960
- Oh, well I'm in the right place, heck of a deal.

234
00:10:56,960 --> 00:11:00,720
Heck of a deal, I could tell you right here.

235
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:05,720
Oh man, as long as we achieve glare reduction.

236
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:08,120
Oh, and that reminds me.

237
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:09,960
- This guy's off his rocker.

238
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:12,680
- The absorbance reflectance ratio,

239
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:14,840
you think approximately.

240
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:17,800
No, the reason I ask is 'cause I'd love to have a good

241
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:20,960
reading on the BTU meter.

242
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:24,000
You know, once I get that thing, it's gotta be right.

243
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,260
(laughing)

244
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:36,960
Could you repeat all that?

245
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:38,960
(sounds of a jet engine)

246
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:40,960
(sounds of a jet engine)

247
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:42,960
Oh yeah, just across the board.

248
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:44,960
Because refraction is key, of course.

249
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:46,960
Across the board.

250
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:48,960
I don't have one of those

251
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:50,960
fancy spectrophotometers

252
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:52,960
and

253
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:54,960
I trust whatever we come up with

254
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:56,960
will give us the absorption we need.

255
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:58,960
(clears throat)

256
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:00,960
Oh! Quick question.

257
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:02,960
Does that remind you anything we could do

258
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:04,960
It's the Jerky Boys film.

259
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:08,960
Reflective film to get rid of the glare?

260
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:11,960
Well, because the bird loved his cream.

261
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:13,960
Oh, God, I think it's the Jerky Boys.

262
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:16,960
That's how I'm going to make a bet with you.

263
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:18,960
I'll bet you a hundred bucks.

264
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:20,960
This is the Jerky Boys.

265
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:21,960
No.

266
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:22,960
It's a Jerky Boys character.

267
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:24,960
Maybe a hybrid film.

268
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:25,960
That's a cliffhanger.

269
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:27,960
The right male puppets at home.

270
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:28,960
We are picture in picture.

271
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:29,960
We can work out, you know.

272
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:31,960
We're the cranky anchor of the Puerto Rican woman.

273
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:32,960
No, no, no.

274
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:34,960
That's an old Jewish grandma.

275
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:35,960
So what's a good time?

276
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:36,960
Maybe tomorrow?

277
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:37,960
About 5 o'clock.

278
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:38,960
5 o'clock.

279
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:39,960
Could do 5.

280
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:40,960
5 o'clock p.m.

281
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:41,960
I'm busy writing this down.

282
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:42,960
That sounds good.

283
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:43,960
You could get completely sucked into a coma.

284
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:44,960
I'm gonna check with that big red here.

285
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:45,960
As long as the guy's going, "What the fuck is it?"

286
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:46,960
If he's available.

287
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:47,960
Hold on.

288
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:48,960
I'm gonna try to get him right here.

289
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:49,960
'Cause I'm not sure.

290
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:50,960
But that sounds good to me.

291
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:51,960
So yeah, let's see.

292
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:52,960
We got that.

293
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:53,960
We're gonna tip.

294
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:54,960
And, uh, I'm gonna try to get him right here.

295
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:55,960
I'm gonna try to get him right here.

296
00:12:55,960 --> 00:13:12,240
that

297
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:13,240
a pill.

298
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:19,680
Hey, yeah this is Noel and Patrick's gonna help us tint our windows tomorrow.

299
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:21,400
I just wanted to let you know.

300
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:22,400
Okay?

301
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:24,520
What do you want to do?

302
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:25,520
Tint the windows.

303
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:26,520
Tint all the windows tomorrow.

304
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:28,880
And he's gonna help us.

305
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:30,640
I'm just waiting about 5 o'clock.

306
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:34,040
Why don't you lay off you son of a bitch criminal?

307
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:36,200
Why don't you lay off of me?

308
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:37,200
I'm just letting you know.

309
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:38,200
You're a piece of shit.

310
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:39,200
You're a piece of shit.

311
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:40,200
Shit.

312
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:41,200
Shit.

313
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:42,200
Shit.

314
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:47,200
*sounds of a vacuum cleaner*

315
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:51,200
Oh, I said, "Patrick, anyway, it'll be fine. Don't you worry about a thing."

316
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:55,200
"And we'll achieve the UV block that makes the most sense."

317
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:57,200
*laughter*

318
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:59,200
"So we'll just get it dialed in."

319
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:01,200
"Get the nanocarbon up."

320
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:03,200
"Get the pig red in the mix."

321
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:05,200
"Get it all sputtered up."

322
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:07,200
*laughter*

323
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:09,200
I can smell the weed through the phone.

324
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:11,200
This guy's a stoner.

325
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:13,200
Total dope.

326
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:15,200
Do you want to take red or?

327
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:17,200
Yeah, yeah.

328
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:21,200
And you've got a spectro-

329
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:23,200
spectro-photometer, right?

330
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:25,200
I do.

331
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:27,200
Do we have spectro-photometers?

332
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:29,200
We don't have one of those.

333
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:31,200
The reason I ask is because I'm going for that

334
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:33,200
U-value as I said.

335
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:35,200
If you've got a BTU meter,

336
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:37,200
that'd be sweet.

337
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:40,200
I got that, I got it all

338
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:42,200
I think we have that, yeah

339
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:44,200
What do you mean you got it all?

340
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:50,200
I'll be in front and Nicodemus will be there flapping his wings, don't you worry about a thing

341
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:53,200
I'll pull the 18 wheeler right up in front

342
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:56,200
Oh, that's gonna be tight

343
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:58,200
That's the weirdest day of my life

344
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:01,200
Oh that sounds perfect, yeah

345
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:04,200
Alright, have a good night

346
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:06,200
You too, thank you

347
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:28,320
the

348
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:30,160
is walking up a lot of people

349
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:33,680
but i think i think you have a lot of people are expecting a report called

350
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:38,040
time at the phone line to picture of the group of people who are not capable of

351
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:39,680
that

352
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:43,280
it could be a little bit of a referral to the group of people who are

353
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:45,360
people who are

354
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:47,760
the

355
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:49,000
why the focus

356
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:53,080
cranky acres called the added to the jerky boys get right now they get your

357
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:54,080
phone number

358
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:57,400
uh... it must be the phone number we put out

359
00:15:57,400 --> 00:16:00,840
I've never seen you just completely cocoon like that.

360
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:01,840
Yeah, that was crazy.

361
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:02,840
You're just losing your mind, dude.

362
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:03,840
Deer and headlights.

363
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:04,840
I get it.

364
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:05,840
That was amazing.

365
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:06,840
That was crazy.

366
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:09,840
I've also never seen you that happy in my entire life.

367
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:10,840
I know, I can't believe.

368
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:12,960
Look at him, he's beaming, dude.

369
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:18,680
Whoever set that up, I don't know if he, because I keep getting calls from Los Angeles and

370
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:19,960
I finally picking it.

371
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:25,840
I picked it up just to, you know, I picked it up to do a prank on a fan, but.

372
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:26,840
That's what you get.

373
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:31,440
Honestly, you spent the last two weeks doing, or last week doing pranks on people who call

374
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:33,440
you. This was your retribution.

375
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:34,440
Oh yeah.

376
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:35,440
This was finally-

377
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:36,440
From the king of it.

378
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:39,240
Yeah, you got revenged. You got fully revenged by-

379
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:42,560
I think that was the guy from Scream.

380
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:46,080
No, it was the guy, what's his name?

381
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:47,880
It was LPC. It had to be-

382
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:48,880
No, no, that was not LPC.

383
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:49,880
I don't know.

384
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:50,880
That was the hash-

385
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:51,880
That was like-

386
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:53,200
That was the hash-slinging slasher from SpongeBob.

387
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:56,720
No, it was that guy who does Indian prank call on YouTube and shit.

388
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:58,380
- Oh, the Jerky Boys.

389
00:16:58,380 --> 00:16:59,220
- No, not the Jerky Boys.

390
00:16:59,220 --> 00:17:00,060
- I'm telling you it was the Jerky Boys.

391
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:01,420
- You're being disrespectful to them.

392
00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:02,260
- It was the Jerky Boys.

393
00:17:02,260 --> 00:17:03,080
- I can't let it happen.

394
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:04,360
You're being disrespectful.

395
00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:06,240
- No, that was clearly,

396
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:09,120
that was probably just some disgruntled factory worker.

397
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:11,000
- Yeah, some random guy calling you.

398
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,200
- It was Ownage Pranks.

399
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:14,440
(laughing)

400
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:17,080
- You got a call from Ownage Pranks.

401
00:17:17,080 --> 00:17:18,360
- What a weird day.

402
00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:19,400
- That was crazy.

403
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:20,220
- Yeah.

404
00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:21,060
- That was awesome.

405
00:17:21,060 --> 00:17:24,240
Whoever, if somebody set that up or something or.

406
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:25,720
- Think somebody paid Ownage Pranks?

407
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:29,120
I think you can pay him to give calls.

408
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:31,000
So whoever did that, that was awesome.

409
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,560
I wonder how they split up the money among themselves.

410
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:35,120
Yeah, the jerky boys.

411
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:37,680
I don't know how Ownage Pranks does that, how they split the money up.

412
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:40,280
Because there's the Indian guy, but then there's also the Vietnamese guy.

413
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:42,760
But then there's also the Chinese guy.

414
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:46,760
You know, it makes no sense.

415
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:47,760
Whoa.

416
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:50,040
That was crisp.

417
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:51,360
That was satisfying.

418
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:54,000
All right, hard reset, guys.

419
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,000
We got our beers.

420
00:17:55,000 --> 00:18:00,720
reset no more fuckin no more getting weird all the joke we're just wasting our

421
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:07,240
fucking time trying to ruin our podcast we're done with that bullshit okay we're

422
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:12,400

423
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:18,280
nope yep slackers slackers like this all around smoking weed probably sick no

425
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:25,940
- What figure are we rocking with today?

426
00:18:25,940 --> 00:18:27,200
- I'm drinking a-- - Matt didn't even get a beer.

427
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:29,240
- I got a Truly Wildberry.

428
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:31,040
- Mm, you watching your figure?

429
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:31,880
- Yeah.

430
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:32,780
- And then you get a--

431
00:18:32,780 --> 00:18:36,040
- I'm watching your figure too.

432
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:37,260
- Okay.

433
00:18:37,260 --> 00:18:39,280
- Yeah, I'd like to watch your figure.

434
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:40,480
- You don't have to look through your kid's list.

435
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:42,320
- I'd like to watch you figure skate.

436
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:45,120
- Yeah, figure out how to figure skate.

437
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:46,040
- Mm-hmm.

438
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:47,280
- With no paint on.

439
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:51,560
- My dad tried to get me to do hockey when I was a kid

440
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:52,760
and he bought me skates.

441
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:53,800
- Tonsil hockey.

442
00:18:53,800 --> 00:19:13,480
and

443
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:18,680
not okay to fuck them. Your dad made you wear full pads to play tonsil hockey with him.

444
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:22,400
That's what you did. And then you did it and he said you're underweight kid. You're gonna

445
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:26,120
have to put on weight for the season. You've got a long grueling tonsil hockey season ahead

446
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:30,920
of you. Tonsil hockey is very similar to... Your dad made me wear a maxi pad. That's not

447
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:34,360
how I would feel like I was a woman. Tonsil hockey with your dad is really similar to normal

448
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:37,800
hockey where you have to start playing when you're really young or else you won't get

449
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:44,160
good at it. Oh yeah. And Pat's dad understood that. Yeah. Yeah. My dad understood the assignment.

450
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:49,320
Yeah. Which was you have to wear. You have to wear. You have to wear. You have to wear

451
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:54,240
pads to make out. To do, well not make out. I'm making out. There's a winner and a loser

452
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:58,080
in tonsil hockey. It's a real game, okay. Now watch this. Now you're the loser because

453
00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:02,400
I fucking did something cool and you just watched, bitch. It wasn't cool at all. I literally

454
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:07,000
flicked a lid. It wasn't cool. You never heard that that that expression? Oh I'm about to

455
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:10,720
flick my lid. I like literally just did it. It's not cool people say that when they're

456
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:15,280
about to ruin their life. No they don't say that. They say I'm about to flick my lid and

457
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:19,120
then they hit somebody and go to jail. I think it's flip your wig. No they oh I'm about to

458
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:24,040
flick my lid. No I'm about to flick my wig. Oh no it's flick my leg. Leg? It's when you

459
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:27,840
do something really funny like you know like a knee slapper. Yeah flick my leg. I think

460
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:32,240
that's a separate expression. Flick my lid I've been saying since I was a kid. Flip my

461
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:38,360
wig. No. It's a Husker Du album, Flip Your Wig. What does flipping your wig mean?

462
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:45,880
Probably the same thing. Losing it? Yeah. Losing that? Losing that thing we

463
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:50,320
don't mention. You know, shaking your head? No, like imagine I'm really lost.

464
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:54,160
Okay Cameron, you demonstrate. Like flipping your hair like this. But if I was

465
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:58,640
wearing a wig. But you don't have a wig on. If it was a wig. Yeah, but if I had a wig I

466
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:03,380
could flip it like that. I think I got a gym injury. Yeah? Yeah I think I hurt my arm.

467
00:21:03,380 --> 00:21:09,860
You got a gym in jury? You got a BTS jury at your case? Your court case?

468
00:21:09,860 --> 00:21:14,240
What is a BTS jury? BTS curry that sounds pretty good.

469
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:21,120
Mm-hmm. Bacon tomato sauce. Bacon tomato soup. Why isn't there a BLT tomato soup on the

470
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:25,060
market? I think there is. I guess the lettuce would not be so good. Yeah.

471
00:21:25,060 --> 00:21:26,060
Yeah.

472
00:21:26,060 --> 00:21:27,060
Lettuce is so good in soup.

473
00:21:27,060 --> 00:21:28,060
What are you talking about?

474
00:21:28,060 --> 00:21:29,060
Mayonnaise probably.

475
00:21:29,060 --> 00:21:30,060
Oh my God.

476
00:21:30,060 --> 00:21:31,060
I keep seeing on like...

477
00:21:31,060 --> 00:21:32,060
Lettuce in broth.

478
00:21:32,060 --> 00:21:33,060
Do you ever watch like Instagram reels?

479
00:21:33,060 --> 00:21:34,060
Yeah.

480
00:21:34,060 --> 00:21:35,060
And they got like the...

481
00:21:35,060 --> 00:21:36,060
Well, I'm a TikTok star now, so I kind of have to.

482
00:21:36,060 --> 00:21:37,060
Well, that's true, yeah.

483
00:21:37,060 --> 00:21:39,660
I need to be cross-posting really because I'm trying to.

484
00:21:39,660 --> 00:21:43,860
Well, you can make up to $1,200 doing Instagram reels.

485
00:21:43,860 --> 00:21:46,540
I keep getting this ad for Instagram.

486
00:21:46,540 --> 00:21:47,540
I keep getting a post.

487
00:21:47,540 --> 00:21:48,540
Really?

488
00:21:48,540 --> 00:21:49,540
Instagram reels are...

489
00:21:49,540 --> 00:21:50,540
I don't know...

490
00:21:50,540 --> 00:21:51,540
Instagram reels are like evil.

491
00:21:51,540 --> 00:21:56,580
though, like whatever the like like algorithm is is very scary.

492
00:21:56,580 --> 00:22:00,740
Yours is creepy. Mine is I do not know what happens of all these medical pages.

493
00:22:00,740 --> 00:22:06,180
You follow you just became a that actually I do follow a bunch of pages

494
00:22:06,180 --> 00:22:08,900

495
00:22:08,900 --> 00:22:12,260
doctor like and he's like doing a peace sign. It's like what's up taking over

496
00:22:12,260 --> 00:22:15,860
this account for the week, but then like every other post is like a post of like

497
00:22:15,860 --> 00:22:19,060
a woman who look like looks like she has the chest burster from alien and it's

498
00:22:19,060 --> 00:22:21,160
It's like what do you think is going on doctors?

499
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:24,860
I want now it just shows me Instagram reels like the suggested reels thing

500
00:22:24,860 --> 00:22:26,560
that goes in between all the posts you view.

501
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:29,560
It's all like deformed dogs and stuff.

502
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:31,060
Yeah, the dog was short spine.

503
00:22:31,060 --> 00:22:32,960
Oh, I hate that weird little dog.

504
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:35,060
Do you want to see like him the one that looks like a frog?

505
00:22:35,060 --> 00:22:36,860
Yeah, there's I mean, there's that one.

506
00:22:36,860 --> 00:22:38,360
There's also the ones with the twisted.

507
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:39,960
Those are the like popular.

508
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:43,860
Yeah, dog, but Instagram reels the like the like recommendation algorithm

509
00:22:43,860 --> 00:22:46,860

Do you want to see one that is crazy?

512
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:49,860
Of course.

513
00:22:49,860 --> 00:22:50,860
Let me find it.

514
00:22:50,860 --> 00:22:55,860
I just don't, honestly, deformed people, love them.

515
00:22:55,860 --> 00:22:57,860
Deformed animals, no I don't like them.

516
00:22:57,860 --> 00:22:59,360
No, you don't need to love them.

517
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:00,360
I don't need to like you.

518
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:01,860
Yeah, they're, look at this thing.

519
00:23:01,860 --> 00:23:05,360
Is that the dog with?

520
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:06,360
Oh, fuck!

521
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:07,860
Oh, yeah, I've seen that one.

522
00:23:07,860 --> 00:23:09,860
That's why you don't smoke cigarettes, that's why I quit.

523
00:23:09,860 --> 00:23:10,860
That's so disgusting.

524
00:23:10,860 --> 00:23:12,360
This dog's name is Arrow.

525
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:15,360
He lost his entire jaw, he's Ebert. He got Eberted.

526
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:16,360
Look at that.

527
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:22,160
Oh, dude, stop showing me that. He looks like the fucking, he looks like Dr. Tongue from

528
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:24,680
Day of the Dead. Wait, okay, hold on, show me, because I haven't seen him, show me him

529
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:29,760
again. Put it up closer. He has no bottom jaw. His tongue is flying out of the side

530
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:34,680
of his head. Oh, so his bottom jaw is broken? He literally looks exactly like the zombie

531
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:39,040
from the beginning of Day of the Dead. I don't think I would, I don't think I would adopt

532
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:43,080
that dog. No, I'd probably, I'd probably leave it wherever it is. I'm thinking about fostering,

533
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:46,440
and we've been thinking about fostering a dog. You already have a dog. I know

534
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:50,680
you're so greedy. I just want every I just I think I want I think I want fifty

535
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:54,920
dogs. He looks exactly like this. Ah doesn't he does yeah. He's got no

536
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:58,240
bottom half to his. Oh yeah. I guess that was funny with

537
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:02,840
it's missing its lower jaw and its tongue is hanging out. It was I guess it

538
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:06,680
kind of looks like it. The Ebert thing was cool that they like gave him a just

539
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:10,520
like a handle on the bottom of his head. You know like he looked he had a like a

540
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:12,140
like a kettlebell upside down.

541
00:24:12,140 --> 00:24:15,760
- He should have gotten a robot jaw.

542
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:16,600
- Yeah, exactly.

543
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:18,680
- Like an iron giant, sharp teeth.

544
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:19,640
- Yeah, that would have been sick.

545
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:21,260
- Like that guy from the Venture Brothers,

546
00:24:21,260 --> 00:24:23,160
that villain that has the robot jaw.

547
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:24,000
- Oh yeah.

548
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:24,820
- They should have been bad.

549
00:24:24,820 --> 00:24:25,660
- But if you're gonna get your mouth removed,

550
00:24:25,660 --> 00:24:29,240
why are they even, like, it's not like the jaw was us like,

551
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:31,560
- Yeah, they should just cover it up like,

552
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:34,360
like when they take, when they steal his mouth

553
00:24:34,360 --> 00:24:35,320
in the Matrix.

554
00:24:35,320 --> 00:24:36,160
- Yeah.

555
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:37,000
- You should have just done that.

556
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:37,840
Just, just spackle it.

557
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:38,660
- Yeah, exactly.

558
00:24:38,660 --> 00:24:39,500
- Just spackle up the dog's mouth.

559
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:48,900
with grout. Spackle it with grout. Take a skin from his leg and put it over his mouth.

560
00:24:48,900 --> 00:24:52,420
And then we don't have to look at it anymore. Yeah. Which I don't think the problem with

561
00:24:52,420 --> 00:24:57,100
Ebert was that he his mouth was open. No the problem was he didn't give he didn't give

562
00:24:57,100 --> 00:25:00,580
good reviews to my favorite movies. That's why they should have sealed his mouth shut.

563
00:25:00,580 --> 00:25:04,900
He would have got into a fight with Bam Margera. Remember that? And didn't he date Oprah? Yeah.

564
00:25:04,900 --> 00:25:06,900
Have you seen that video of him at the

565
00:25:06,900 --> 00:25:13,700
Fuck what is it? I bet he ate crazy pussy though. Yeah mouth. That's how I got mouth cancer

566
00:25:13,700 --> 00:25:16,380
from Oprah

567
00:25:16,380 --> 00:25:18,620
Oprah yeah, I mean it will do that to you

568
00:25:18,620 --> 00:25:26,180
Roger you were got mouth cancer because he's too good at eating pussy, which I'm afraid every day

569
00:25:26,180 --> 00:25:32,740
I have a lump in my mouth right now really I've never even thought of having that problem. You have that problem

570
00:25:32,740 --> 00:25:37,020
I don't have that problem. That's what happened to Michael. That's actually what happened to Michael Douglas he claims

571
00:25:37,020 --> 00:25:43,420
Michael Douglas claims that he got mouth cancer from eating. Michael Douglas has mouth cancer? He had mouth cancer and

572
00:25:43,420 --> 00:25:47,860
Then he claims that he got it from eating Catherine Zeta-Jones pussy too good

573
00:25:47,860 --> 00:25:51,140
He dated Catherine Zeta-Jones? He's married to her

574
00:25:51,140 --> 00:25:54,740
The only I told you about this. Why would you? They go on dates, yeah?

575
00:25:54,740 --> 00:26:00,380
Yeah, why would you stay married to a woman who gave you mouth cancer? Exactly. Yeah, I told you about this

576
00:26:00,380 --> 00:26:03,020
There's a restaurant in my hometown called...

577
00:26:03,020 --> 00:26:04,220
I think a train conductor.

578
00:26:04,220 --> 00:26:05,180
Yeah, the hat's big.

579
00:26:05,180 --> 00:26:10,620
There's a restaurant in my hometown called The Bacon Barn, and the only two celebrity

580
00:26:10,620 --> 00:26:15,660
photos on the wall are Michael Douglas, Catherine Zeta-Jones, and then Hornswoggle from the WWE.

581
00:26:15,660 --> 00:26:16,460
That's sick.

582
00:26:16,460 --> 00:26:17,180
So tight.

583
00:26:17,180 --> 00:26:21,820
Me and Joe went to... I had to have talked about this before. We went to some diner in LA one time

584
00:26:21,820 --> 00:26:25,740
that had all the celebrity pictures of people who had been there. And then right next to Brad

585
00:26:25,740 --> 00:26:30,140
Brad Pitt, there was a guy and his name was like he had like a nickname like

586
00:26:30,140 --> 00:26:33,740
worm or something and it's just a random dude holding a ketchup bottle. It was

587
00:26:33,740 --> 00:26:36,540
like worm first to use the new ketchup bottle.

588
00:26:36,540 --> 00:26:44,640
Like Brad Pitt Bill Clinton shit my favorite they always have or like a few

589
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:48,640
places. I've been when when they don't have like celebrity pictures, but they

590
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:52,940
have like like five guys had this and I think also the South Street Diner in

591
00:26:52,940 --> 00:26:55,140
Boston had it where they don't have celebrity pictures, but they have like

592
00:26:55,140 --> 00:26:58,500
like a page from like a comic book where like an artist like drew that like

593
00:26:58,500 --> 00:27:05,180
that's so funny to me like you couldn't even get a nerd like and you're gonna

594
00:27:05,180 --> 00:27:09,580
frame it for a restaurant I'd probably put up pictures of famous scientists

595
00:27:09,580 --> 00:27:12,820
yeah we're actually not famous scientists accomplished I would actually

596
00:27:12,820 --> 00:27:17,140
probably put up pictures of like famous chefs and food tasters yeah and porn

597
00:27:17,140 --> 00:27:24,140
stars yeah on the wall I put like a big mural of like a Bella danger me

598
00:27:24,140 --> 00:27:30,140
eating pussy. Come on. That's nasty. You wouldn't do that. That fucking picture of...

599
00:27:30,140 --> 00:27:35,780
That painting of Drake eating pussy. Mm-hmm. That's... I want to get that. I want to get a

600
00:27:35,780 --> 00:27:39,240
print of that and put it in my house. You know that picture of the the grandpa

601
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:45,520
eating paint and he thought it was yogurt? That's gonna be my restaurant. Oh yeah. I don't even want to say what I'm

602
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:52,620
thinking about it. It's Roger Ebert at the NAACP Image Awards. Cool. What does he do?

603
00:27:52,620 --> 00:28:00,140
they have him guess a song he like they play a little snippet mm-hmm

604
00:28:00,140 --> 00:28:03,140
questions

605
00:28:03,140 --> 00:28:08,620
he's gonna finish you the proto feud yeah just proves that he's just such that

606
00:28:08,620 --> 00:28:11,940
he's the best host of all time

607
00:28:16,220 --> 00:28:26,620
He's a beast. Yeah dude, Roger Ebert was so cool. Rest in peace. And then Siskel.

608
00:28:26,620 --> 00:28:34,460
Siskel? Siskel. Siskel. Thong song. No, Siskel. Siskel and Ebert. The other guy.

609
00:28:34,460 --> 00:28:39,580
Let me see that movie. You're right, that's what I'm thinking of.

610
00:28:39,580 --> 00:28:44,300
I think of Cisco. Is Cisco the one who had the crazy hair?

611
00:28:44,300 --> 00:28:48,540
Is that like, that's got to be on like Mad TV, right?

612
00:28:48,540 --> 00:28:55,340
Like Cisco, Cisco and then it's the movie song. And it's to the thong song.

613
00:28:55,340 --> 00:28:58,820
I don't think anyone has ever thought of that. The movie song.

614
00:28:58,820 --> 00:29:01,700
Maybe Cisco and Ebert would be like a better.

615
00:29:01,700 --> 00:29:02,700
Cisco and Ebert, yeah.

616
00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:04,540
I don't think it makes any sense without the Ebert part.

617
00:29:04,540 --> 00:29:06,540
Yeah, I think that that would maybe be how you would have to do it.

618
00:29:06,540 --> 00:29:09,180
- I think if Gene Siskel is an accomplished movie critic,

619
00:29:09,180 --> 00:29:11,240
I think it would make complete sense.

620
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:12,080
- I don't think--

621
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:14,180
- I think what if Gene Siskel, he died,

622
00:29:14,180 --> 00:29:16,260
and then it was Ebert and Roper, right?

623
00:29:16,260 --> 00:29:17,100
- Yeah.

624
00:29:17,100 --> 00:29:18,900
- There's another parody there.

625
00:29:18,900 --> 00:29:19,740
- And now it's just--

626
00:29:19,740 --> 00:29:20,560
- It's violent.

627
00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:21,400
- And then it was just Roper.

628
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:22,240
- Yeah.

629
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:23,580
- But RogerEbert.com or something,

630
00:29:23,580 --> 00:29:25,780
they still, it's just like a bunch of movie reviewers.

631
00:29:25,780 --> 00:29:26,700
- It's really funny.

632
00:29:26,700 --> 00:29:29,580
- Yeah, it's like, just call it fucking movie,

633
00:29:29,580 --> 00:29:30,420
one, two, three movies.

634
00:29:30,420 --> 00:29:31,260
- Yeah, movies.

635
00:29:31,260 --> 00:29:32,080
- One, two, three movies.

636
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:32,920

637
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:33,760
- Yeah.

638
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:34,580
- Yeah.

639
00:29:34,580 --> 00:29:36,300
- What would, we should just start,

640
00:29:36,300 --> 00:29:39,780
know someone's talking about pitchfork yesterday yeah and they were like

641
00:29:39,780 --> 00:29:44,380
pitchfork now is just like they don't even review music they just do articles

642
00:29:44,380 --> 00:29:48,540
about I like stuff that happens I said this to you guys before I think but we

643
00:29:48,540 --> 00:29:52,620

reviewing it. No, you're copyrighting. Hold on. You're doing copyright. Hold on.

677
00:31:51,820 --> 00:31:58,820
done. Overall, I give Truly Wildberry three cans out of four.

678
00:31:58,820 --> 00:32:01,820
Well, you have one can.

679
00:32:01,820 --> 00:32:03,540
No, that's my review system.

680
00:32:03,540 --> 00:32:04,820
Well, you have one can right there.

681
00:32:04,820 --> 00:32:05,820
Three cans out of four.

682
00:32:05,820 --> 00:32:09,180
You clearly have one can. You can't include our can. There's three cans here, but these

683
00:32:09,180 --> 00:32:10,180
aren't Truly.

684
00:32:10,180 --> 00:32:12,820
Three truly cans, three cans out of four for...

685
00:32:12,820 --> 00:32:14,580
No, the other cans are ours.

686
00:32:14,580 --> 00:32:17,460
Because it is giving, it's currently giving me heartburn.

687
00:32:17,460 --> 00:32:18,460
It's giving heartburn.

688
00:32:18,460 --> 00:32:22,260
Wait, you think that we're on a can system at beers we drank?

689
00:32:22,260 --> 00:32:23,260
Bottle system?

690
00:32:23,260 --> 00:32:24,260
It's kegs.

691
00:32:24,260 --> 00:32:27,860
It's a 16 ounce glass system.

692
00:32:27,860 --> 00:32:33,860
Okay, so you'd say I gave this three 16 ounce glasses out of four 16 ounce glasses.

693
00:32:33,860 --> 00:32:34,860
Okay?

694
00:32:34,860 --> 00:32:35,860
Why wouldn't it be kegs?

695
00:32:35,860 --> 00:32:39,620
Because we can't drink that much, idiot!

696
00:32:39,620 --> 00:32:44,060
It's an actual realistic podcast, we're not trying to portray, "Oh, I can drink a million

697
00:32:44,060 --> 00:32:45,820
beers," okay?

698
00:32:45,820 --> 00:32:47,820
We need more positive media. Yeah.

699
00:32:47,820 --> 00:32:49,820
No fear drinking and amounting of beer.

700
00:32:49,820 --> 00:32:51,820
How much do you think you could drink?

701
00:32:51,820 --> 00:32:53,820
How much do you think I could drink?

702
00:32:53,820 --> 00:32:55,820
10 trillion ounces.

703
00:32:55,820 --> 00:32:57,820
I can drink an endless amount of beers and sodas.

704
00:32:57,820 --> 00:32:59,820
Yeah.

705
00:32:59,820 --> 00:33:01,820
Two glasses of water, I'm like full

706
00:33:01,820 --> 00:33:03,820
like Thanksgiving.

707
00:33:03,820 --> 00:33:05,820
But 15 sodas and beers,

708
00:33:05,820 --> 00:33:07,820
it's fine.

709
00:33:07,820 --> 00:33:09,820
They turn into just like

710
00:33:09,820 --> 00:33:11,820
it's like when

711
00:33:11,820 --> 00:33:13,820
milk sits out too long.

712
00:33:13,820 --> 00:33:17,820
I used to be able to put away a 24 pack of beer.

713
00:33:17,820 --> 00:33:23,500
- In the fridge.

714
00:33:23,500 --> 00:33:27,260
- I used to be able to put a 24 pack of beer,

715
00:33:27,260 --> 00:33:31,580
like I could drink a whole 24 pack in a night.

716
00:33:31,580 --> 00:33:33,980
- I'm trying to get a 24 pack, so I've been in the gym.

717
00:33:33,980 --> 00:33:34,820
- Yeah.

718
00:33:34,820 --> 00:33:36,140
- Yeah, I'm trying to get myself a 24 pack.

719
00:33:36,140 --> 00:33:37,460
- You've all seen me do this, where it's like,

720
00:33:37,460 --> 00:33:39,820
oh, let's get like a, back in college,

721
00:33:39,820 --> 00:33:42,620
we'd buy like a 30, and then like,

722
00:33:42,620 --> 00:33:44,620
like two-thirds of it I would have drank.

723
00:33:44,620 --> 00:33:48,740
Are you trying to impress a 17-year-old boy right now by saying this on the podcast or

724
00:33:48,740 --> 00:33:49,740
something?

725
00:33:49,740 --> 00:33:50,740
No, I'm just reminiscing with my friends.

726
00:33:50,740 --> 00:33:51,740
Okay, all right.

727
00:33:51,740 --> 00:33:55,220
Reminiscing about the time that you drank a bunch of beer?

728
00:33:55,220 --> 00:33:56,220
Yeah.

729
00:33:56,220 --> 00:33:57,380
All right, let's check in.

730
00:33:57,380 --> 00:34:01,140
Some of the best times of my life were going to your apartment and drinking all of the

731
00:34:01,140 --> 00:34:02,140
beers.

732
00:34:02,140 --> 00:34:03,140
I mean, you guys saw me back there.

733
00:34:03,140 --> 00:34:04,940
I could drink like two ounces of beer.

734
00:34:04,940 --> 00:34:05,940
You could drink two beers.

735
00:34:05,940 --> 00:34:08,500
One time he drank two beers, smoked weed, and turned green.

736
00:34:08,500 --> 00:34:09,940
Yeah, I was there for that.

737
00:34:09,940 --> 00:34:10,940
He turned completely green.

738
00:34:10,940 --> 00:34:11,940
I was there for that.

739
00:34:11,940 --> 00:34:16,260
that was one of the first times we ever hung out. You had two beers and then you kept going like...

740
00:34:16,260 --> 00:34:21,460
I don't know. It wasn't the beers that was the problem. Yeah, I know. It was the weed.

741
00:34:21,460 --> 00:34:25,780
Weed is always the problem. You turned green like Shrek. It happened to me another time.

742
00:34:25,780 --> 00:34:30,340
Yeah? Yeah, that happened to me two times. Did you also turn green then? I don't know. Nobody saw me.

743
00:34:30,340 --> 00:34:38,420
Whoa. I was invisible. That's cool. I went completely invisible. It's fucking epic.

744
00:34:38,420 --> 00:34:40,820
Are you kidding me? That's the sickest shit I've ever heard.

745
00:34:40,820 --> 00:34:42,820
Yeah, nobody could see me.

746
00:34:42,820 --> 00:34:44,820
The fuck? That's so cool.

747
00:34:44,820 --> 00:34:46,820
I went clear like the Trulie I was drinking.

748
00:34:46,820 --> 00:34:48,820
I wasn't drinking Trulie.

749
00:34:48,820 --> 00:34:50,820
Damn it.

750
00:34:50,820 --> 00:34:52,820
Do you ever drink them? You ever drink a Trulie?

751
00:34:52,820 --> 00:34:54,820
See, I don't...

752
00:34:54,820 --> 00:34:56,820
Can we move on from beers, guys?

753
00:34:56,820 --> 00:34:58,820
You're the one who wanted to talk about them.

754
00:34:58,820 --> 00:35:00,820
You brought up your new show.

755
00:35:00,820 --> 00:35:02,820
You wanted to get free marketing.

756
00:35:02,820 --> 00:35:04,820
And then I tried to audition and somebody got in there.

757
00:35:04,820 --> 00:35:06,820
I think me and Pat are gonna start "Beers We Would Like To Drink."

758
00:35:06,820 --> 00:35:11,220
would like to drink. Okay, so it's like years we imagined beers. We that we

759
00:35:11,220 --> 00:35:16,420
might drink beers. We might make you're not gonna miss beer. Okay, wait, okay,

760
00:35:16,420 --> 00:35:23,020
wait, wait. I've got it. It's called it's called a space meteor. Yeah, 90%

761
00:35:23,020 --> 00:35:27,620
ABV when I was smoking and it's got comic book art on. I was smoking a

762
00:35:27,620 --> 00:35:31,820
bunch of weed. I was like and it's it's branded and it's purple. Yeah, it's

763
00:35:31,820 --> 00:35:35,400
Brandon, it's a collaboration with Bruno Mars.

764
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:36,780
(laughing)

765
00:35:36,780 --> 00:35:37,620
- When I was like two years ago--

766
00:35:37,620 --> 00:35:39,180
- They only sell it in California.

767
00:35:39,180 --> 00:35:40,020
- Okay, here's what--

768
00:35:40,020 --> 00:35:41,380
- This is a terrible beer idea.

769
00:35:41,380 --> 00:35:42,700
- Here's a beer idea, it's an amazing beer.

770
00:35:42,700 --> 00:35:44,140
- You're not allowed to review our beer

771
00:35:44,140 --> 00:35:44,980
'cause you didn't drink it.

772
00:35:44,980 --> 00:35:46,940
- It's called Beer Energy.

773
00:35:46,940 --> 00:35:48,100
- Okay, I like it.

774
00:35:48,100 --> 00:35:50,460
Let's see where you're going with this.

775
00:35:50,460 --> 00:35:51,880
What does the can look like?

776
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:54,060
- The can is black with blue--

777
00:35:54,060 --> 00:35:54,900
- Can you be quiet?

778
00:35:54,900 --> 00:35:55,720
- Shut up.

779
00:35:55,720 --> 00:35:56,560
- Caleb, Caleb, you need to shut up.

780
00:35:56,560 --> 00:35:57,380
- Shut up.

781
00:35:57,380 --> 00:35:58,380
- Fine, I'll do my own podcast.

782
00:35:58,380 --> 00:36:00,140
- The can is black with blue lightning.

783
00:36:00,140 --> 00:36:00,980
- You shut up.

784
00:36:00,980 --> 00:36:04,740
Oh, dude, we could get AC DC or Metallica.

785
00:36:04,740 --> 00:36:06,240
AC or Metallica could be in on this.

786
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:07,120
Or both.

787
00:36:07,120 --> 00:36:07,960
Both of them.

788
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:13,360
And then it is basically,

789
00:36:13,360 --> 00:36:18,720
it is a Bud Light with Mio Energy squirted into it.

790
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:20,760
That's actually a really good idea.

791
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:24,040
So it's 24 ounce or 22 ounces of Bud Light.

792
00:36:24,040 --> 00:36:24,880
Yeah.

793
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:26,040
And then two ounces of Mio Energy.

794
00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:26,880
What are you doing?

795
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:28,720
You can think of a beer too.

796
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:29,920
You can make your own beer too.

797
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:33,120
I'm just making out with whatever you were doing was making your microphone

798
00:36:33,120 --> 00:36:34,720
cable make crazy noises.

799
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:36,620
Yeah, you've you're you're fudging.

800
00:36:36,620 --> 00:36:37,620
You need to go on time.

801
00:36:37,620 --> 00:36:39,720
I am a genius with beer ideas.

802
00:36:39,720 --> 00:36:42,120
Tell you literally haven't come up with a single beer.

803
00:36:42,120 --> 00:36:44,720
I did close two years ago when I was smoking a bunch of weed.

804
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:46,520
It's not going to be one you came up with the past.

805
00:36:46,520 --> 00:36:47,820
You have to come up with a new one.

806
00:36:47,820 --> 00:36:50,720
I was smoking a bunch of weed and I was like, I'm going to start making

807
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:51,320
kombucha.

808
00:36:51,320 --> 00:36:55,120
And so I would every night I would have a an idea and I'd be like that's

809
00:36:55,120 --> 00:36:57,920
gonna be such a great idea for a kombucha flavor.

810
00:36:58,120 --> 00:37:00,200
And then recently I found that note in my phone,

811
00:37:00,200 --> 00:37:02,560
and one of the ideas was soy sauce and vanilla.

812
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:04,820
(laughing)

813
00:37:04,820 --> 00:37:09,680
And I was like, I guess, like two years ago,

814
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:12,680
I was like, that would be the best flavor ever.

815
00:37:12,680 --> 00:37:15,160
So I'm a beer expert.

816
00:37:15,160 --> 00:37:16,200
I am a beer expert.

817
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:18,520
- My new idea, Pat.

818
00:37:18,520 --> 00:37:20,400
I don't know.

819
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:21,560
- Wait, soy sauce.

820
00:37:21,560 --> 00:37:23,720
- Soy sauce and vanilla kombucha.

821
00:37:23,720 --> 00:37:26,400
(laughing)

822
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:31,880
I don't know how I ever even like I don't I don't think I tasted so I saw us with

823
00:37:31,880 --> 00:37:35,580
vanilla or anything I just was like that would be really good I've I've heard

824
00:37:35,580 --> 00:37:39,980
that I forget there's like one of these one of these like Instagram chefs I

825
00:37:39,980 --> 00:37:44,900

828
00:37:53,680 --> 00:38:00,220

829
00:38:00,220 --> 00:38:05,020
and that's so good doesn't sound that sounds horrible terrible and it has like

00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:31,120
silver flavored beer what about what about okay Bruce Bogtrotters curse and

845
00:39:31,120 --> 00:39:32,120
and it's

846
00:39:32,120 --> 00:39:39,480
it's a it's a fifteen percent a b v sixty ounce, I P a chocolate cake

847
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:40,080
flavored

848
00:39:40,080 --> 00:39:47,760
twist off yeah yeah, it comes in a six pack only. Well, I always thought that

849
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:51,760
they should put you know the lid that they put on ibuprofen that on beer. So

850
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:55,600
that's when you're too drunk. You can't even open one yeah yeah. If I was a

851
00:39:55,600 --> 00:39:57,840
president that you can't open that when you're drunk,

852
00:39:59,560 --> 00:40:03,240
if you're like so fucked up that you're like,

853
00:40:03,240 --> 00:40:04,080
you could open it, you could twist off.

854
00:40:04,080 --> 00:40:07,160
- I feel like that's easier than a bottle opener.

855
00:40:07,160 --> 00:40:09,080
- Not a bottle, I mean if you're really fucked up,

856
00:40:09,080 --> 00:40:10,600
it's all these.

857
00:40:10,600 --> 00:40:12,840
- Bud Light Lime. - It's all these pop tabs.

858
00:40:12,840 --> 00:40:14,720
- But I feel like that's probably one of the easiest lids

859
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:15,840
to open. - It's at least a little harder,

860
00:40:15,840 --> 00:40:16,680
okay?

861
00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:18,640
- I think it's easier. - Did I ever show you guys

862
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:21,000
the movie I was writing about beer?

863
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:21,840
- Maybe.

864
00:40:21,840 --> 00:40:22,960
- Bud Light Lime, the movie?

865
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:24,400
- Oh yeah, you did. - Yeah.

866
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:25,240
- Yeah, I think. - Bud Light Lime.

867
00:40:25,240 --> 00:40:27,160
- What if we did a live reading of it on the podcast?

868
00:40:27,160 --> 00:40:28,200
- I thought you already did that.

869
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:31,120
I don't think I want to do that. I think we've already done that. Yeah, I think you

870
00:40:31,120 --> 00:40:35,840
did already do it years ago. We did. Oh, we did. Yeah. Yep. Yeah. I forgot we did

871
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:39,560
that. Yeah. Yeah. You guys want to read my movie? Do you want to like, I don't

872
00:40:39,560 --> 00:40:44,880
know, maybe get it like maybe we pitch it. No, maybe we like do it at Carnegie

873
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:49,640
Hall. That's fine. I would like to go to Carnegie Hall. What about crud light?

874
00:40:49,640 --> 00:40:53,000
And it's all it's the region. It's they they make the bud light. They do the

875
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:56,560
quality test. Oh, it's all the fails the quality test. It becomes crud light.

876
00:40:56,560 --> 00:40:57,440
It's way cheaper.

877
00:40:57,440 --> 00:40:59,240
There should be something at bars.

878
00:40:59,240 --> 00:41:02,200
What about, okay, have you ever had an Aero bar?

879
00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:03,040
No.

880
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:05,520
Or like a, like an Aero bar is like a chocolate.

881
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:06,480
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

882
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:07,520
It's full of air.

883
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:09,720
Yeah, it's like, you know, like World Market and shit.

884
00:41:09,720 --> 00:41:11,360
B-A-R-O.

885
00:41:11,360 --> 00:41:12,200
It's full of air.

886
00:41:12,200 --> 00:41:13,520
It's full of the foam.

887
00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:14,640
Beer, only foam.

888
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:15,480
That's a good idea.

889
00:41:15,480 --> 00:41:16,320
Only the foam of a beer.

890
00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:17,640
I always thought, you know.

891
00:41:17,640 --> 00:41:19,240
It's in like a shaving cream.

892
00:41:19,240 --> 00:41:21,360
It's in a spray, yeah.

893
00:41:21,360 --> 00:41:22,200
Or an--

894
00:41:22,200 --> 00:41:25,800
So if you pour your beer and there's not enough foam,

895
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:28,600
you can spray some foam on top of it.

896
00:41:28,600 --> 00:41:30,600
It's really good for...

897
00:41:30,600 --> 00:41:32,600
It's the biggest hack that bartenders have.

898
00:41:32,600 --> 00:41:33,600
It's good for photo shoots.

899
00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:37,600
Yeah, good for photo shoots and if you pour a Guinness wrong.

900
00:41:37,600 --> 00:41:38,600
Yeah, yeah.

901
00:41:38,600 --> 00:41:40,600
There's no wrong way to pour a Guinness.

902
00:41:40,600 --> 00:41:45,800
And the spray can, it has a reverse setting, so if you have too much foam on your beer,

903
00:41:45,800 --> 00:41:48,600
you can suck the foam back up into the can and reuse it later.

904
00:41:48,600 --> 00:41:52,100
I do want something like what they do in Mad Max when they spray paint their mouth.

905
00:41:52,100 --> 00:41:53,100
Yeah, I want that so bad.

906
00:41:53,100 --> 00:41:55,100
Oh, that's such a good idea, the chrome beer.

907
00:41:55,100 --> 00:42:00,060
There's a new energy spray called Pazaz. I think that's what it's called.

908
00:42:00,060 --> 00:42:02,140
It looks… I keep seeing it at bodegas and I want to buy it.

909
00:42:02,140 --> 00:42:03,260
How many times do you spray it?

910
00:42:03,260 --> 00:42:05,580
How many times do you spray it?

911
00:42:05,580 --> 00:42:06,060
On your mouth.

912
00:42:06,060 --> 00:42:07,340
How many?

913
00:42:07,340 --> 00:42:09,420
How many times do you spray it?

914
00:42:09,420 --> 00:42:09,660
Yeah.

915
00:42:09,660 --> 00:42:11,740
I think maybe just once or twice.

916
00:42:11,740 --> 00:42:12,380
So if you drank the whole thing, you'd probably die.

917
00:42:12,380 --> 00:42:17,740
It's like a caffeine… Yeah, I think it's like a high… I think it's called Pazaz. P-A-Z-A-Z.

918
00:42:17,740 --> 00:42:23,420
There's no way they can sell like 15,000 milligrams of caffeine in a little bottle.

919
00:42:23,420 --> 00:42:31,540
little bottle. Yeah, Pazazz Energy Mist is a breath spray. A breast spray? Breast spray.

920
00:42:31,540 --> 00:42:38,620
Come on, bro. Come on, dog. You can buy a four pack for twenty, oh, I know that guy.

921
00:42:38,620 --> 00:42:43,940
That's Robbie. He's on their website. What the fuck are you talking about? I have a really

922
00:42:43,940 --> 00:42:47,560
good beer idea whenever you get done looking at this website. What? But yeah, it's an energy

923
00:42:47,560 --> 00:42:52,680
mist that you can spray in your mouth and they sell it at bodegas.

924
00:42:52,680 --> 00:42:55,880
So going off of that, they should do that with beer.

925
00:42:55,880 --> 00:42:57,680
Yeah, a drunken spray.

926
00:42:57,680 --> 00:43:00,440
Why have they not done a toothpaste?

927
00:43:00,440 --> 00:43:02,560
Here's my beer idea, okay?

928
00:43:02,560 --> 00:43:04,120
Let me paint a picture for you.

929
00:43:04,120 --> 00:43:05,120
Comes in a four pack.

930
00:43:05,120 --> 00:43:06,120
Okay?

931
00:43:06,120 --> 00:43:07,120
Wow.

932
00:43:07,120 --> 00:43:10,800
It's a four pack, but they're not arranged like a square.

933
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:11,800
They're in a row.

934
00:43:11,800 --> 00:43:12,800
Okay.

935
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:14,600
Okay, there's an arrow on the side, which order you're supposed to drink them.

936
00:43:14,600 --> 00:43:16,280
They're numbered, which order you're supposed to drink them.

937
00:43:16,280 --> 00:43:17,880
All right, I'm going to get back in.

938
00:43:17,880 --> 00:43:19,980
First one, open it up, drink it.

939
00:43:19,980 --> 00:43:22,160
It tastes exactly like bread.

940
00:43:22,160 --> 00:43:23,660
Okay.

941
00:43:23,660 --> 00:43:26,640
Second one, open it up, drink it.

942
00:43:26,640 --> 00:43:28,300
Exactly like peanut butter.

943
00:43:28,300 --> 00:43:29,300
No way.

944
00:43:29,300 --> 00:43:30,300
There's no way.

945
00:43:30,300 --> 00:43:32,300
Third one, open it up, drink it.

946
00:43:32,300 --> 00:43:33,300
Jelly.

947
00:43:33,300 --> 00:43:34,300
Fuck me.

948
00:43:34,300 --> 00:43:35,300
Fuck me.

949
00:43:35,300 --> 00:43:37,760
No spoilers here, but the fourth one, it's bread.

950
00:43:37,760 --> 00:43:38,940
It's bread again?

951
00:43:38,940 --> 00:43:40,880
And it's called the sandwich experience.

952
00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:41,880
Wow.

953
00:43:41,880 --> 00:43:42,880
That sounds incredible.

954
00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:45,040
And it could be a viral challenge that people drink the bread.

955
00:43:45,040 --> 00:43:47,120
- Go with the PB or a J.

956
00:43:47,120 --> 00:43:47,960
- PB or a J?

957
00:43:47,960 --> 00:43:48,800
- PB or a J.

958
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:49,620
- Experience.

959
00:43:49,620 --> 00:43:51,200
- It's an experience.

960
00:43:51,200 --> 00:43:54,240
- Here's going off of that idea.

961
00:43:54,240 --> 00:43:55,080
- Yeah.

962
00:43:55,080 --> 00:43:55,920
- Six beers in a row.

963
00:43:55,920 --> 00:43:56,920
- Okay.

964
00:43:56,920 --> 00:43:58,560
- So first one.

965
00:43:58,560 --> 00:43:59,400
- Yeah.

966
00:43:59,400 --> 00:44:03,920
- Pretty much like an O'Doul's, like it's a one ABV.

967
00:44:03,920 --> 00:44:04,920
- Okay.

968
00:44:04,920 --> 00:44:09,920
- Second one is a four ABV.

969
00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:14,320
So it's like, so it's called, it's like hot ones.

970
00:44:14,320 --> 00:44:16,000
it gets gradually stronger.

971
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:18,320
- Oh, I was thinking it would be called the mountain,

972
00:44:18,320 --> 00:44:20,880
and the one in the middle would be like 20% ABV,

973
00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:21,960
the ones on either side like nine.

974
00:44:21,960 --> 00:44:22,800
- And it goes down, yeah.

975
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:23,800
- And then O'Douls.

976
00:44:23,800 --> 00:44:24,640
- That's smart, yeah.

977
00:44:24,640 --> 00:44:26,080
- Then you have like a perfect peak.

978
00:44:26,080 --> 00:44:27,760
- Yeah, yeah. - You're coming back down,

979
00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:28,600
you're hitting O'Douls again.

980
00:44:28,600 --> 00:44:30,200
- I would be in the liquor store switching them all out,

981
00:44:30,200 --> 00:44:32,760
I'd get a full pack of 20% ABV.

982
00:44:32,760 --> 00:44:34,920
- My dad claims one O'Douls in the morning

983
00:44:34,920 --> 00:44:36,920
after like a night of heavy drinking

984
00:44:36,920 --> 00:44:38,960
is the perfect hangover cure.

985
00:44:38,960 --> 00:44:39,920
- Really? - Yeah.

986
00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:42,040
- I'll have to remember that. - And I've tested it,

987
00:44:42,040 --> 00:44:43,480
and it works.

988
00:44:43,480 --> 00:44:50,480
so he doesn't claim that you're claiming i'm claiming that my dad is correct

989
00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:54,040
as a good way to say that my dad is so smart

990
00:44:54,040 --> 00:44:57,800
yeah i've never met my dad never imparted any kind of knowledge like that

991
00:44:57,800 --> 00:45:01,440
yet my dad's always dropping knowledge bombs like that my dad is not very

992
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:05,880
knowledgeable what about a beer bottle and it's it's empty comes empty if can

993
00:45:05,880 --> 00:45:08,700
fill it with beer and carried around

994
00:45:08,700 --> 00:45:12,940
What about algene beer bottle? Exactly yeah. You can put whatever stickers you want.

995
00:45:12,940 --> 00:45:19,180
What about like a sex doll but it's all glass? And you fill it up with beer? It's filled with

996
00:45:19,180 --> 00:45:23,740
beer. And you drink it out of the pussy and butt? Yeah either one is fine. Yeah. And you could or

997
00:45:23,740 --> 00:45:28,380
you could double team it. Whoa. You could trade it off with your friend. You could fuck it when

998
00:45:28,380 --> 00:45:34,460
you're done. What about like it's like a it's like a humidifier and you put beer in it and it puts

999
00:45:34,460 --> 00:45:38,540
beer gas into the air. So anyone in the house or room it gets really it's

1000
00:45:38,540 --> 00:45:42,660
messed up. It's really beard up and then you could have one in your car and

1001
00:45:42,660 --> 00:45:47,500
then also we could sell a so that's a beer midifier and then we could sell a

1002
00:45:47,500 --> 00:45:50,740
D beer midifier, which is the only way you can get it out of your house. Once

1003
00:45:50,740 --> 00:45:53,340
true in the air because you want to rope them in and then you sell them the

1004
00:45:53,340 --> 00:45:56,420
yeah, exactly problem in the solution because there's no way to turn it off.

1005
00:45:56,420 --> 00:45:59,740
Once you plug it in, that's smart. You are you're going to die unless you

1006
00:45:59,740 --> 00:46:05,740
but a beer carousel. How would that work? It spins and it gives you a new beer

1007
00:46:05,740 --> 00:46:10,220
every time. Oh, that's smart as fuck. Like a sushi conveyor belt, but for beer.

1008
00:46:10,220 --> 00:46:17,020
Yeah. Beer roulette. Beer roulette. So everything has a different beer on it.

1009
00:46:17,020 --> 00:46:24,780
It's different. So it's like a four or like a six pack of beer, but one of them

1010
00:46:24,780 --> 00:46:28,220
is like just like 20, one of them is just water.

1011
00:46:28,220 --> 00:46:31,620
- I do wanna see the kind of like fucking kids,

1012
00:46:31,620 --> 00:46:35,980
code name kids next door engineering that weed heads do.

1013
00:46:35,980 --> 00:46:37,540
I wanna see that applied to beer.

1014
00:46:37,540 --> 00:46:38,740
We have some fun stuff.

1015
00:46:38,740 --> 00:46:39,580
- See that's the thing.

1016
00:46:39,580 --> 00:46:41,140
- 'Cause listen, we don't smoke weed, okay?

1017
00:46:41,140 --> 00:46:41,980
We like beer.

1018
00:46:41,980 --> 00:46:44,780
- I hate weed, I hate weed, but I love--

1019
00:46:44,780 --> 00:46:46,220
- But I like the weekend.

1020
00:46:46,220 --> 00:46:47,580
- 'Cause I can drink beer.

1021
00:46:47,580 --> 00:46:48,860
- Yeah. - The weed again.

1022
00:46:48,860 --> 00:46:49,700
- Yeah.

1023
00:46:49,700 --> 00:46:53,120
- I hate weed, I hate smoking weed,

1024
00:46:53,120 --> 00:46:55,220
I hate being high off the pot.

1025
00:46:55,220 --> 00:46:56,840
I hate having THC in my body,

1026
00:46:56,840 --> 00:47:01,840
but I do appreciate the spirit of invention.

1027
00:47:01,840 --> 00:47:04,100
- Yeah, they do a pretty good job.

1028
00:47:04,100 --> 00:47:06,860
- They, you know, if you have to smoke out of a,

1029
00:47:06,860 --> 00:47:09,780
they used to have to smoke vape out of a plastic bag.

1030
00:47:09,780 --> 00:47:10,620
Where is that?

1031
00:47:10,620 --> 00:47:14,140
I think maybe it's because beer is already perfect as it is.

1032
00:47:14,140 --> 00:47:15,220
- Yep. - Yeah.

1033
00:47:15,220 --> 00:47:17,860
- They used to castrate opera singers too.

1034
00:47:17,860 --> 00:47:19,660
- To make them sing high.

1035
00:47:19,660 --> 00:47:21,900
- No, just stuff that, yeah, stuff they used to do.

1036
00:47:21,900 --> 00:47:26,860
I need to buy the equivalent of a Rick and Morty bubbler,

1037
00:47:26,860 --> 00:47:27,700
but for beer.

1038
00:47:27,700 --> 00:47:28,520
- Exactly.

1039
00:47:28,520 --> 00:47:29,360
- Whatever that is.

1040
00:47:29,360 --> 00:47:30,200
- Well, they have Rick and Morty IPAs.

1041
00:47:30,200 --> 00:47:31,160
- You know what I really like?

1042
00:47:31,160 --> 00:47:33,680
- But that's the thing, it's not the IPA.

1043
00:47:33,680 --> 00:47:36,160
That is an apparatus, I need to buy something.

1044
00:47:36,160 --> 00:47:38,400
- You need an, yeah, there has to be more apparatus.

1045
00:47:38,400 --> 00:47:39,880
- Yeah, exactly, a device.

1046
00:47:39,880 --> 00:47:44,880
- I also think that IPAs are completely like,

1047
00:47:44,880 --> 00:47:45,720
- That's the weed of beer.

1048
00:47:45,720 --> 00:47:47,680
- I think that's like CIA.

1049
00:47:47,680 --> 00:47:48,520
- Yeah.

1050
00:47:48,520 --> 00:47:49,340
- Yeah.

1051
00:47:49,340 --> 00:47:50,180
- Because it's an act.

1052
00:47:50,180 --> 00:47:51,020
- Three letters.

1053
00:47:51,020 --> 00:47:56,300
they came up pretty recently if you remember correctly I never had one until

1054
00:47:56,300 --> 00:48:02,780
I was 21 yeah and then they also are like they're like they just that's the truth

1055
00:48:02,780 --> 00:48:06,580
yeah three letters they taste bad they're trying to they try to scare

1056
00:48:06,580 --> 00:48:10,100
people out of drinking beer yeah so they were like we'll make a shit what a beer

1059
00:48:19,020 --> 00:48:24,920
that's an IPA yeah exactly a Simpsons movie you think that the I and IPA would

1060
00:48:24,920 --> 00:48:28,500
stand for Irish a lot of people don't know the grandpa in the Simpsons movie

1061
00:48:28,500 --> 00:48:33,580
we're saying II Pais talking about an IPA mm-hmm and what and how do you says to

1067
00:48:57,900 --> 00:49:03,380
better than a 400 calorie tea drink nothing nothing I try to think of

1068
00:49:03,380 --> 00:49:06,740
something I couldn't think of as many calories as two ice cream sandwiches and

1069
00:49:06,740 --> 00:49:10,620
it gets you about as buzzed as half a but ice cream sandwich that's a variation

1070
00:49:10,620 --> 00:49:15,580
on the PB&J experience it is ice cream sandwiches personally one of my favorite

1071
00:49:15,580 --> 00:49:21,660
ice cream sandwiches. I hate the chocolate one but like a chip witch or like a

1072
00:49:21,660 --> 00:49:25,980
Choco Taco. It's called a chippy chip. A chippy chip. That's the ones they sell

1073
00:49:25,980 --> 00:49:31,840
over there. Do you guys want to get a chippy chip after this? I can't get a

1074
00:49:31,840 --> 00:49:35,540
chippy chip. You don't want to get a chippy chip? No I have to go shortly after. You

1075
00:49:35,540 --> 00:49:38,920
don't want to get a chippy chip? No I also don't like ice cream. You don't want

1076
00:49:38,920 --> 00:49:43,060
a chippy chip? I don't like ice cream. You don't want to get a chippy chip? No I just

1077
00:49:43,060 --> 00:49:43,900
- I don't want ice cream.

1078
00:49:43,900 --> 00:49:45,860
- You just said you love ice cream sandwiches though.

1079
00:49:45,860 --> 00:49:48,460
- I like ice cream sandwiches pretty well.

1080
00:49:48,460 --> 00:49:50,020
- A chippy chip is an ice cream sandwich.

1081
00:49:50,020 --> 00:49:50,860
- But I don't like ice cream that much.

1082
00:49:50,860 --> 00:49:54,700
- You guys, I just got one free tube of Pizzazz.

1083
00:49:54,700 --> 00:49:55,540
- Holy shit, really?

1084
00:49:55,540 --> 00:49:56,380
- Are you serious?

1085
00:49:56,380 --> 00:49:57,200
- You won?

1086
00:49:57,200 --> 00:49:59,260
- I won one free tube of Pizzazz.

1087
00:49:59,260 --> 00:50:01,900
I was very close to getting one year of Zazz.

1088
00:50:01,900 --> 00:50:03,380
- That's gonna really fuck your life up.

1089
00:50:03,380 --> 00:50:04,220
- Yeah?

1090
00:50:04,220 --> 00:50:05,040
- Yeah.

1091
00:50:05,040 --> 00:50:05,880
- Can't you just refresh it and do it again

1092
00:50:05,880 --> 00:50:07,420
and try to get the one year?

1093
00:50:07,420 --> 00:50:09,460
- I think I'm gonna buy.

1094
00:50:09,460 --> 00:50:10,300
- Don't do this.

1095
00:50:10,300 --> 00:50:11,820
- Oh, so it's a coupon code.

1096
00:50:11,820 --> 00:50:13,100
So it's not, yeah.

1097
00:50:13,100 --> 00:50:16,340
I think I'm just gonna keep entering in emails

1098
00:50:16,340 --> 00:50:18,540
until I get one free year of Pazazz.

1099
00:50:18,540 --> 00:50:19,380
- I'm sure it's gonna work.

1100
00:50:19,380 --> 00:50:21,380
- But I'm sure purchase is necessary as well.

1101
00:50:21,380 --> 00:50:24,460
- So I'd have to buy one and then I get one free year of Zazz.

1102
00:50:24,460 --> 00:50:25,420
- Yeah. - Yeah, it's a good deal.

1103
00:50:25,420 --> 00:50:26,260
- That's a pretty good deal.

1104
00:50:26,260 --> 00:50:27,100
- Yeah.

1105
00:50:27,100 --> 00:50:29,580
- Have you guys ever won a lifetime supply of anything

1106
00:50:29,580 --> 00:50:30,420
or the lottery?

1107
00:50:30,420 --> 00:50:33,260
- I want to win a lifetime supply of something so bad.

1108
00:50:33,260 --> 00:50:34,100
- I wanna-- - A lifetime supply,

1109
00:50:34,100 --> 00:50:35,420
you know, that lasts about 10 minutes.

1110
00:50:35,420 --> 00:50:36,260
- Yeah. - Yeah.

1111
00:50:36,260 --> 00:50:37,100
- Yeah. - I wanna win--

1112
00:50:37,100 --> 00:50:37,940
- Or an hour if you're trying to go somewhere.

1113
00:50:37,940 --> 00:50:40,420
- Or a lifetime supply of something so fucking bad.

1114
00:50:40,420 --> 00:50:43,940
I want a lifetime supply of happiness by being born into this world.

1115
00:50:43,940 --> 00:50:45,620
It's beautiful. Born under Christ.

1116
00:50:45,620 --> 00:50:46,900
So beautiful.

1117
00:50:46,900 --> 00:50:50,700
Lifetime is how long it takes a girl to get her makeup on.

1118
00:50:50,700 --> 00:50:54,060
Yeah, an hour. That's what I said. It takes an hour.

1119
00:50:54,060 --> 00:50:58,060
Yeah, well, yeah. An hour is what I said. I kind of clarified it. That's why we're a team.

1120
00:50:58,060 --> 00:50:59,900
You kind of just said a D'Worst version.

1121
00:50:59,900 --> 00:51:02,540
That didn't really fit in. We're like a comedy duo.

1122
00:51:02,540 --> 00:51:06,340
Yeah, kind of like a trio, but you and me kind of have our own thing right there, obviously.

1123
00:51:06,340 --> 00:51:09,380
Yeah, where you just like take whatever I say and make it less

1124
00:51:09,380 --> 00:51:14,820
interesting a little bit. We have our own thing where I eat his chips.

1125
00:51:14,820 --> 00:51:18,900
I also have one of those things where I eat your chips too.

1126
00:51:18,900 --> 00:51:25,220
Who? I mean your thing. Did you just call me Patches? Patrick. You think I called you

1127
00:51:25,220 --> 00:51:30,660
Patrick? Your name is Patrick and you thought I called you Patches? Yeah. No.

1128
00:51:30,660 --> 00:51:35,340
No. Okay. All right this is bad we're all eating chips at the same time. Yeah I

1129
00:51:35,340 --> 00:51:37,340
I stopped eating my chips.

1130
00:51:37,340 --> 00:51:39,340
So you eat the chips faster.

1131
00:51:39,340 --> 00:51:41,340
I can talk about anything I want now.

1132
00:51:41,340 --> 00:51:43,340
Say something.

1133
00:51:43,340 --> 00:51:45,340
Speaking of lifetime supplies of things,

1134
00:51:45,340 --> 00:51:49,340
when I was in like 4th or 5th grade or something,

1135
00:51:49,340 --> 00:51:51,340
Transworld Magazine used to have these contests

1136
00:51:51,340 --> 00:51:53,340
where you could like,

1137
00:51:53,340 --> 00:51:55,340
you could enter to win

1138
00:51:55,340 --> 00:51:57,340
like a free box

1139
00:51:57,340 --> 00:51:59,340
basically of like boards and stuff.

1140
00:51:59,340 --> 00:52:01,340
And I never won one of those,

1141
00:52:01,340 --> 00:52:03,340
but I've always wanted to win one.

1142
00:52:03,340 --> 00:52:04,900
I want an Xbox as a child.

1143
00:52:04,900 --> 00:52:11,580
I want it because they used to have like, you get like three or four boards from somebody,

1144
00:52:11,580 --> 00:52:16,740
a bunch of clothes, a bunch of stickers, a bunch of trucks, a bunch of wheels.

1145
00:52:16,740 --> 00:52:19,700
If somebody could win that for me.

1146
00:52:19,700 --> 00:52:20,700
What's the publisher's...

1147
00:52:20,700 --> 00:52:28,420
I'm going to have an endless supply of minions doing lifetime supply entries for me.

1148
00:52:28,420 --> 00:52:30,780
Because I need a lifetime supply of something.

1149
00:52:30,780 --> 00:52:33,820
Yeah, what's the current lifetime supply at Sweepstakes?

1150
00:52:33,820 --> 00:52:34,900
They only do one at a time,

1151
00:52:34,900 --> 00:52:36,820
'cause otherwise it would get overwhelmed.

1152
00:52:36,820 --> 00:52:38,540
It's probably estrogen.

1153
00:52:38,540 --> 00:52:42,020
If I would split a lifetime supply of something

1154
00:52:42,020 --> 00:52:44,660
with one person, 50/50, if somebody wins--

1155
00:52:44,660 --> 00:52:46,260
But then that's a half of a lifetime.

1156
00:52:46,260 --> 00:52:49,140
What do you mean, you would get alternate weeks,

1157
00:52:49,140 --> 00:52:50,140
like divorced parents,

1158
00:52:50,140 --> 00:52:51,500
or you would split right down the middle?

1159
00:52:51,500 --> 00:52:54,220
You'd be like, "My life is halfway over."

1160
00:52:54,220 --> 00:52:55,780
Guys, huge news.

1161
00:52:55,780 --> 00:52:56,620
What?

1162
00:52:56,620 --> 00:52:57,660
Here's, I just looked up,

1163
00:52:57,660 --> 00:53:00,940
I'm on SweepsAdvantage, sweepstakesadvantage.com.

1164
00:53:00,940 --> 00:53:03,900
I've got a list of sweepstakes here.

1165
00:53:03,900 --> 00:53:06,320

00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:12,300
Enter the Enfamil Family Beginnings Formula

00:53:12,300 --> 00:53:14,500
for a year sweepstakes for a chance to win.

1170
00:53:14,500 --> 00:53:16,220
One prize will be awarded each month

1171
00:53:16,220 --> 00:53:17,060
during the promotion period.

1172
00:53:17,060 --> 00:53:18,660
- I think I'm ready to have a kid.

1173
00:53:18,660 --> 00:53:21,020
- It says this prize consists of a year's supply

1174
00:53:21,020 --> 00:53:22,780

1175
00:53:22,780 --> 00:53:25,380

00:59:25,560 --> 00:59:27,560
It's actually about cumming nowadays.

1349
00:59:27,560 --> 00:59:29,560
Songs are about cumming, but movies are about...

1350
00:59:29,560 --> 00:59:31,560
Shows used to be about...

1351
00:59:31,560 --> 00:59:35,560
Movies are about being an actor in Los Angeles and also being a hitman.

1352
00:59:35,560 --> 00:59:40,360
a music song nowadays, you'll turn it on it's a woman singing and she says, I

1356
00:59:51,620 --> 00:59:52,040
art.

1357
00:59:52,040 --> 01:00:01,680
They've got sticky lines like grimer or muck going from her hand to her whole. I

1358
01:00:01,680 --> 01:00:05,400
don't know if it's honey. It's covered in honey and chocolate.

1359

1371
01:01:04,120 --> 01:01:04,960
(laughing)

1372
01:01:04,960 --> 01:01:08,240
Which is a complete fucking cardinal sin, they say.

1373
01:01:08,240 --> 01:01:11,520
- I want to open a whole graveyard

1374
01:01:11,520 --> 01:01:14,480
from the amount of babies in my face.

1375
01:01:14,480 --> 01:01:16,120
In my, on the load on my face.

1376
01:01:16,120 --> 01:01:16,940
- Yeah, that's what they want to say.

1377
01:01:16,940 --> 01:01:20,240
- I want you to turn my butthole into a graveyard of semen.

1378
01:01:20,240 --> 01:01:22,080
Is what they're saying in these songs.

1379
01:01:22,080 --> 01:01:25,780
- I want to see little tiny homunculus baby skulls

1380
01:01:25,780 --> 01:01:27,560
all in Cardi B's asshole.

1381
01:01:27,560 --> 01:01:28,880
That's what she wants to say these days.

1382
01:01:28,880 --> 01:01:29,840
- Cover me in sin.

1383
01:01:29,840 --> 01:01:30,680
- Yeah.

1384
01:01:30,680 --> 01:01:33,360
- She's saying-- - Into my cervix.

1385
01:01:33,360 --> 01:01:36,720
- Also, these women have the fucking gall

1386
01:01:36,720 --> 01:01:39,480
to have asses so big that you can barely

1387
01:01:39,480 --> 01:01:41,400
put your thing through it.

1388
01:01:41,400 --> 01:01:42,240
- Yeah. - And reach one

1389
01:01:42,240 --> 01:01:43,560
of the two things. - Exactly.

1390
01:01:43,560 --> 01:01:46,240
- It's like a hot dog and a hamburger bun.

1391
01:01:46,240 --> 01:01:47,080
- 'Cause they're trying to make it

1392
01:01:47,080 --> 01:01:48,240
so that they can never have a baby,

1393
01:01:48,240 --> 01:01:50,080
so they're like, I'm gonna get my ass so big

1394
01:01:50,080 --> 01:01:51,500
that a guy just has to fuck my ass

1395
01:01:51,500 --> 01:01:52,840
and then come in my butt crack

1396
01:01:52,840 --> 01:01:54,520
and never actually get close to actually

1397
01:01:54,520 --> 01:01:55,720
creating a beautiful life. - Exactly.

1398
01:01:55,720 --> 01:01:56,540
That's what I want.

1399
01:01:56,540 --> 01:02:00,160
I want miraculous new babies in my butt.

1400
01:02:00,160 --> 01:02:01,160
I want a macular concession.

1401
01:02:01,160 --> 01:02:02,160
I want them up in my butt.

1402
01:02:02,160 --> 01:02:04,680
I don't want them in the place they need to be.

1403
01:02:04,680 --> 01:02:05,680
Yep.

1404
01:02:05,680 --> 01:02:12,800
And they're saying, "Oh, I got a diaphragm put in so it catches all the cum."

1405
01:02:12,800 --> 01:02:15,280
It's like nowadays, I heard about this.

1406
01:02:15,280 --> 01:02:17,280
I don't know about you guys, if you've heard about this.

1407
01:02:17,280 --> 01:02:22,240
Apparently nowadays, in order to prevent life from happening, women are getting IEDs that

1408
01:02:22,240 --> 01:02:25,440
blow up the babies when they're eight months old.

1409
01:02:25,440 --> 01:02:28,560
And what happened to songs being about saying hey to Delilah?

1410
01:02:28,560 --> 01:02:29,560
Yeah.

1411
01:02:29,560 --> 01:02:31,560
That was actually a very powerful song.

1412
01:02:31,560 --> 01:02:33,560
That was actually a beautiful ass song.

1413
01:02:33,560 --> 01:02:35,560
That was actually a beautiful ass song as well.

1414
01:02:35,560 --> 01:02:37,560
Two teenagers falling in love.

1415
01:02:37,560 --> 01:02:39,560
Little Diddy by Jack and Diane.

1416
01:02:39,560 --> 01:02:41,560
What happened to that?

1417
01:02:41,560 --> 01:02:43,560
Nowadays songs are about two teenagers just going at it.

1418
01:02:43,560 --> 01:02:45,560
Getting up inside each other.

1419
01:02:45,560 --> 01:02:47,560
Jack and Diane used to be about two teenagers sucking on a chili dog.

1420
01:02:47,560 --> 01:02:49,560
Now it's about, now every song is about making a chili dog.

1421
01:02:49,560 --> 01:02:51,560
Because you put your wiener in a butt.

1422
01:02:51,560 --> 01:02:53,560
These days it would probably be

1423
01:02:53,560 --> 01:02:55,560
Little Diddy put your cum in my hand.

1424
01:02:55,560 --> 01:02:57,560
Because they want to waste the cum by putting it in their hand.

1425
01:02:57,560 --> 01:02:58,400
putting it in their hand.

1426
01:02:58,400 --> 01:03:00,480
And also, kids these days can be named Diddy.

1427
01:03:00,480 --> 01:03:02,120
(laughing)

1428
01:03:02,120 --> 01:03:03,360
The fuck is that?

1429
01:03:03,360 --> 01:03:05,320
- I had a manager in a restaurant call me that.

1430
01:03:05,320 --> 01:03:06,160
- He's saying, "Little Diddy."

1431
01:03:06,160 --> 01:03:07,400
- 'Cause my initials were P.D.

1432
01:03:07,400 --> 01:03:10,720
And it was short for, he called me Puff Daddy.

1433
01:03:10,720 --> 01:03:11,560
- What?

1434
01:03:11,560 --> 01:03:13,160
- That's what happens at restaurants now.

1435
01:03:13,160 --> 01:03:14,880
- And now restaurants don't even serve food.

1436
01:03:14,880 --> 01:03:15,720
They're serving.

1437
01:03:15,720 --> 01:03:16,880
- They're singing.

1438
01:03:16,880 --> 01:03:18,360
- They're serving like, "Yo, yo, yo."

1439
01:03:18,360 --> 01:03:20,400
They're serving their customers.

1440
01:03:20,400 --> 01:03:22,040
Like, "You just got served, Diddy."

1441
01:03:22,040 --> 01:03:22,880
That's what he said to you.

1442
01:03:22,880 --> 01:03:24,360
- That's what my manager would say to me.

1443
01:03:24,360 --> 01:03:26,200
And then I would have to sing to the customers

1444
01:03:26,200 --> 01:03:27,020
when it was their birthday.

1445
01:03:27,020 --> 01:03:30,740
you they diss you they say your cards decline. I would have to sing to the customers when

1446
01:03:30,740 --> 01:03:35,220
it was their birthday I'd say happy happy birthday from Applebee's to you we wish it

1447
01:03:35,220 --> 01:03:39,140
was our birthday so we could party too. It's like Applebee's you don't have a birthday

1448
01:03:39,140 --> 01:03:42,900
you're a company right the other thing they want corporations to be people. Nowadays people

1449
01:03:42,900 --> 01:03:47,900
and that's not leftist. People in Seattle and Portland they're holding up magnifying

1450
01:03:47,900 --> 01:03:52,140
glasses to loads and they're looking at ants. They're seeing little ants and babies in there

1451
01:03:52,140 --> 01:03:55,540
they're waving and doing little heart signs to them and they flush it down the toilet

1452
01:03:55,540 --> 01:03:58,420
and make 'em battle rats and mutant ninja turtles.

1453
01:03:58,420 --> 01:04:00,700
- That's right, that's right.

1454
01:04:00,700 --> 01:04:01,940
- And nowadays-- - Get that nut

1455
01:04:01,940 --> 01:04:03,540
out of the toilet!

1456
01:04:03,540 --> 01:04:06,820
The nut goes in the girl, not the fuckin' toilet!

1457
01:04:06,820 --> 01:04:08,260
- Nut goes in your wife-- - Dude, not touch

1458
01:04:08,260 --> 01:04:09,700
that flusher. - Not the toilet.

1459
01:04:09,700 --> 01:04:10,620
You'll be full of strife. - Pick it up,

1460
01:04:10,620 --> 01:04:12,940
put it back up there.

1461
01:04:12,940 --> 01:04:14,940
- Reach your hand-- - At least reuse it.

1462
01:04:14,940 --> 01:04:16,260
Save it for next time. - Everybody, right now,

1463
01:04:16,260 --> 01:04:17,660
okay, life pro tip.

1464
01:04:17,660 --> 01:04:19,140
- Nut inside your wife or your life

1465
01:04:19,140 --> 01:04:20,300
full of strife. - Go to your toilet.

1466
01:04:20,300 --> 01:04:22,500
Everybody has a little bit of nut stuck in their toilet

1467
01:04:22,500 --> 01:04:24,340
'cause of how many nuts had been flushed down

1468
01:04:24,340 --> 01:04:25,420
by previous tenants.

1469
01:04:25,420 --> 01:04:30,620
I would hope go reach in grab it like you like you hid money in there for a long

1470
01:04:30,620 --> 01:04:34,120
time and you're trying to get it put it in your wife while she's making food.
