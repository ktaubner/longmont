59
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:05,860

They're fucking huge.

99
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:26,480
They're the biggest things on earth.

00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:27,480
Look, you get in there.

00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:33,880
If you get in there, I'll put some crawfish, I'll put some potatoes and shit, some corn

104
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:34,880
on the cob.

105
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:39,840
I actually sleep in this giant tub of spice rub, so you just get in there. Oh no, I changed

106
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:43,920
my mind. Okay, I actually sleep in the oven now, now that you've rolled around in the

107
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:44,920
spice rub.

108
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:49,200
What if he was preparing for a role and he was trying to gain a lot of weight real fast

109
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:51,360
by eating like 120 pounds a person?

110
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:53,480
Yeah, that's the fastest way to gain weight.

111
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:54,480
Like he's just walking around.

112
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:55,800
Yeah, to eat someone who's bigger than you.

113
00:05:55,800 --> 00:06:00,000
He's walking around on that J-Lo movie, just he looks like the pregnant man. He just has

114
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,320
like a humongous big belly full of delicious woman I don't know would have

115
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:12,360
been a good move he's definitely eating a bite of somebody yeah oh yeah I think

116
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:17,720
he's definitely eaten somebody oh I don't know it's a twin I haven't seen

117
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:22,680
him since the social network that's true come on that's true funny that like I

118
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:28,040
think about like oh what what roles does this guy play that I can think of and

119
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:32,820
it's like it's call me by your name the social network and sorry to bother you

120
00:06:32,820 --> 00:06:35,960
and like all of those roles I'm like yeah okay that guy could have eaten someone

121
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:41,320
right yeah easily why I think he's a cannibal he was trying to eat Timothée

122
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:45,440
Chalamet that whole time he you see he ate the freaking peach with those little

126
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:02,720
basically a type of that's even worse that's like eating a thousand babies I

127
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:06,560
know that's like the most horrible thing ever

128
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:14,080
I mean like yeah that killed all yeah that was the original that was the

129
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:21,840
original draft of that um Goya painting with uh yeah Saturn eating his giant

130
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:25,040
bowl of cum. Saturn eating his son's cum.

131
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:31,120
Oh! Why'd you gotta take it there? Well he's the Sun in the painting. The Sun is in the

132
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:38,800
sky. No he's not. You stupid idiot. The Sun is... you're dumb dude. Mm-hmm. You're so stupid.

133
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:44,840
You would eat cum if I gave it to you. I would. What? You would? Take that. You're being weird.

134
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:48,600
Ever since you shaved your face you've been weird. I haven't been weird. You have

135
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:49,960
You just acted weird.

136
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:55,040
You stopped drinking and you shaved your face and now you're, I find you a bit odd.

137
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:56,400
Not my problem.

138
00:07:56,400 --> 00:08:00,400
Can you do something, can you grow facial hair back but this time do like some cool, maybe

139
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:01,400
like-

140
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:02,400
Can you do like just a soul patch?

141
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:03,400
I'll grow a soul patch, yeah.

142
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:07,200
Yeah, just like a huge soul patch, like it pops out an inch and a half off your face.

143
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:08,200
Like Scott Ian.

144
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:11,840
Can you do a soul patch that's shaped like the star of David?

145
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:15,600
I would take a very fine worksmanship by a barber.

146
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:16,600
I could do it.

147
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:20,740
I'm thinking about getting the once because I've been I shaved my head back in like

148
00:08:20,740 --> 00:08:27,840
What was it like October something like that? Oh, yeah, and I'm thinking about when I when I finally get a haircut

149
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:32,760
I'm thinking about shaving the Jollibee logo in the back of my head. That would be sick to be

150
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:38,040
Mm-hmm the Jollibee best friend. I would be advanced dude. Yeah, are you gonna have do that? I

151
00:08:38,040 --> 00:08:44,740
Don't know you got to come to New York and walk into a Dominican barbershop with a picture of that and be like

152
00:08:44,740 --> 00:08:47,260
"Can you guys lace me up with this?"

153
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:49,140
Yeah, and then they give you antenna.

154
00:08:49,140 --> 00:08:51,380
And I can't understand what you're asking.

155
00:08:51,380 --> 00:08:53,460
(laughing)

156
00:08:53,460 --> 00:08:58,460
Yeah, and I get a lineup with my receding hairline.

157
00:08:58,460 --> 00:08:59,700
That's always such a good look.

158
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:04,140
I do think it would be funny if I tried to give myself waves.

159
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:04,980
Yeah?

160
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:08,300
Yeah, maybe throw my hair out and try and wave it up.

161
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:09,180

you're fat you're a girl

194
00:11:42,780 --> 00:11:46,480
I drank two cups of coffee before this.

195
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:47,680
I ran out of coffee.

196
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:54,280
So apparently I bought some instant coffee that I was like, "Fuck yeah, I'm gonna down

197
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:55,280
this shit."

198
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:59,200
And the other day, the last three days I've been drinking it, so much of it.

199
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:00,960
I felt like shit all the time.

200
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:03,800
I had a horrible headache.

201
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:08,120
And then last night I went and looked at the package and it's fucking decaf.

202
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:10,520
And I have not had caffeine for three days.

203
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:14,740
I thought that I had lead poisoning. I was like I have lead poisoning.

204
00:12:14,740 --> 00:12:17,240
Why did you think you had lead poisoning?

205
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:21,600
Because I found out also yesterday morning that you're not supposed to

206
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:25,800
drink hot water from the tap because it can lead can dissolve into it and I was

207
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:28,440
like fuck I've been doing that my whole life maybe it's finally catching up to

208
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:29,820
me and now I'm dying of lead poisoning.

209
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:31,820
Why do you drink hot water from the tap?

210
00:12:31,820 --> 00:12:34,680
It boils faster when I make tea.

211
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:36,680
Okay that's fine.

212
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:38,680
You didn't think I was a tea drinker.

213
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:42,120
do it so you're still wrong but I'm glad you're not just drinking hot water that's

214
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:48,520
something I could see you doing drinking I like hot water I like a nice cup of

215
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:51,960
hot I like a nice cup of warm I like drinking something hot because it keeps

216
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:57,040
me if it's hot I don't just like chug it because I'll chug anything cold it'll be

217
00:12:57,040 --> 00:13:01,360
just be gone yeah that's why I mean I drink hot coffee I only drink ice coffee

218
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:06,200
I don't think so I think I only drink ice coffee I don't drink are you one of

219
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:09,780
- Cold brew is better than iced coffee too.

220
00:13:09,780 --> 00:13:11,720
Iced coffee is the worst kind of coffee.

221
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:16,880
The three types of coffee are hot, iced, and cold brew.

222
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:17,720
- Yep.

223
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:19,560
- And it goes hot, cold brew, iced.

224
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:21,360
- No. - Sure.

225
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:23,320
- No, maybe cold brew, hot, iced.

226
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:25,480
- I don't really care what kind of coffee I have,

227
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:26,760
if I'm being honest. - You care?

228
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:28,360
- It doesn't bother me.

229
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:30,200
Are you one of these people, Patrick,

230
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:34,080
who like in Boston, when it's 10 degrees outside,

231
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:36,560
you get an iced coffee and put it in a styrofoam cup?

232
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:38,720
- I started drinking coffee in September.

233
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:39,840
I'm not even--

234
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:41,400
- So you haven't really gotten a chance then?

235
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:42,240
- No.

236
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:43,840
- Those people are freaks.

237
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:45,760
I respect them a lot.

238
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:48,400
- Yeah, they're always really fat also,

239
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:50,680
which I feel like is a,

240
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:52,820
that makes it easier to not get cold.

241
00:13:52,820 --> 00:13:54,560
- I don't think they're always really fat.

242
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:55,960
- Anytime I see them in Boston,

243
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:57,680
they're very, very fat people.

244
00:13:57,680 --> 00:13:58,880
They're disgusting.

245
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:00,240
- It's like a sully.

246
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:03,040
- It's like a sully type person, yeah.

247
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:06,080
Oh it's a sully or it's a nurse. Those are the two.

248
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:07,080
Also fat.

249
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:08,080
Yeah. No.

250
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:12,880
Yeah, one of the fatter, which is fine, but one of the fatter professions a woman can have.

251
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:16,540
Look, why do you hate nurses so much?

252
00:14:16,540 --> 00:14:21,120
Because they sit around on their fucking phones all day and then expect you to call them doctor.

253
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:22,120
Yeah.

254
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:23,940
They don't expect you to call them doctor.

255
00:14:23,940 --> 00:14:25,840
They do. Nurses are evil. Okay?

256
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:30,380
Their job is literally just to stall you so the doctor has more time to jack off in the

257
00:14:30,380 --> 00:14:33,020
bathroom before he has to come and hit your knee with the

258
00:14:33,020 --> 00:14:38,060
hammer yeah that's literally in the same way that in the same way that that the

259
00:14:38,060 --> 00:14:48,540
police force developed out of slave patrols nurses systematically very very

260
00:14:48,540 --> 00:14:53,940
fucked up professionally developed out of openers at comedy shows exactly those

261
00:14:53,940 --> 00:14:58,220
all became nurses they develop they developed out of a guy who stands outside

262
00:14:58,220 --> 00:15:02,660
the door of the doctor's office and shoots you if you try to walk in yeah I

263
00:15:02,660 --> 00:15:05,800
I just don't like that nurses do all this extra bullshit.

264
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:07,640
I don't wanna know what my heart rate is.

265
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:09,140
- Yeah, you go to the doctor and you're like,

266
00:15:09,140 --> 00:15:13,200
okay, I think I have a tumor in my armpit.

267
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:14,640
And the nurse comes in and goes,

268
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:16,880
okay, well, I'm gonna test the temperature

269
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:18,640
of your breath five times,

270
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:19,480
and then I'm gonna take your height.

271
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:22,480
- Let me suck your dick.

272
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:24,820
- Come on, bitch, I'm here to get cancer.

273
00:15:24,820 --> 00:15:28,400
Or not get cancer, I don't remember.

274
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:30,920
They're always trying to fucking,

275
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:34,640

287
00:16:27,620 --> 00:16:32,360

00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:21,880
Once I start saying it, I can't stop.

00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:22,720
Yeah?

348
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:23,560
Yeah.

349
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:24,760
Get it out of your system.

350
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:26,240
Come on baby!

351
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:27,680
(laughing)

352
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:29,360
Let's do the twist!

353
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:32,120
Was he good at the twist, you think?

354
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:33,560
He invented the twist!

355
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:35,160
Yeah, but was he the best?

356
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:36,120
There could have been, yeah, you know,

357
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:36,960
there could have been a guy better than him.

358
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:39,600
could have been a better twister could have been a woman better than him at the

359
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:43,920
twist and because it was the 50s they never talked about it yeah we need like

360
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:49,540
a hidden figures style movie about yeah actually yeah most inventions are like

361
00:21:49,540 --> 00:21:53,000
that right like Thomas Edison made the light probably that's probably why he

362
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:57,440
made let's twist again because somebody made a really good somebody was better

363
00:21:57,440 --> 00:22:02,800
than him at the twist and he was like I can't have them fucking Octavia Spencer

364
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:05,680
kept one upping people throughout history that's like when squeeze

365
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:09,240
re-recorded all their fucking songs because the record label owned them or

366
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:13,000
whatever yeah it's exactly like that spot the difference just like it's just

367
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:18,200
like that Patrick you're so fucking smart I'm not yeah you are I'm just give you

368
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:26,520
an IQ test again now that I'm not drunk and I bet you've studied no yeah no it's

369
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:30,120
like you like Thomas Edison made the first light bulb but I bet that light

370
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:36,280
bulb like just sucked ass yeah yeah there was no way to screw it in it didn't

371
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:39,960
light up yeah the first guy to make a glass ball with a little line inside it

372
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:43,240
yeah Edison what was it like the phonograph or like the edit like the

373
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:47,320
wax cylinders and then they made records and records were better yeah every

374
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:50,920
invention that gets better after right we should have the inventor any credit

375
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:54,320
doesn't matter they made the worst it's like we shouldn't reward someone for

376
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:58,120
making the worst version of something exactly also I can't make a better

377
00:22:58,120 --> 00:23:03,800
light bulb than Thomas Edison. What's your first ingredient? Glass. Second

378
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:10,040
ingredient? Electricity. Damn he's good. This guy's a new Thomas Edison right now.

379
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:17,600
The third ingredient is two friends to help me put this together. Yeah, now anytime something new comes out you

380
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:22,440
should just be like oh well that sucks cuz the next thing's gonna be better.

381
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:23,960
I'm not gonna get it.

382
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:24,800
- It's true.

383
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:27,080
- You shouldn't ever get anything unless it's the last one.

384
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:29,680
- I'm saving all my money for the coolest thing ever

385
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:30,520
when that comes out.

386
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:31,760
The like last thing.

387
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:34,080
- Yeah, the last thing you make

388
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:35,600
is gonna be really, really good.

389
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:37,040
- I never wanna have buyer's remorse,

390
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:38,720
so I'm waiting for the last computer

391
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:39,920
and the last TV and the last--

392
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:42,200
- I'm gonna watch the last movie only.

393
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:43,040
- Yeah, only that one.

394
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:43,860
- That's all I need to watch.

395
00:23:43,860 --> 00:23:44,880
- 'Cause that'll probably be the best one.

396
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:45,720
- Yeah. - Yeah.

397
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:49,240
I mean, that's why, I mean, Star Wars Episode IX,

398
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:50,680
it's the last movie, it's the best one.

399
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:51,640
- It's the best one, dude.

400
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:57,480
not the last movie they're making more what last one don't know why more

401
00:23:57,480 --> 00:24:02,200
forever dude Star Wars is is it take it with TT's doing a trilogy or something

402
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:05,840

403
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:10,780

404
00:24:10,780 --> 00:24:16,120
new one's actually pretty good I know I know I'm gonna yeah you're so awkward

405
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:20,720
dude I think Taika Waititi could probably do something fun with Star Wars but I

406
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:27,080
don't think he will yeah he should do a scary movie he a scary creepy a scary

407
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:32,240
Star Wars yeah they could never know they could never make a scary Star Wars just

408
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:38,520
make Chewbacca like bad anytime just try to make a red lightsaber that would be

409
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:43,360
pretty that's so true a haunted red lightsaber yeah right or like maybe

410
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:47,160
Freddy Krueger but he has lightsaber tiny lightsaber that's on his finger

411
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:54,040
Yeah, and he goes into people's four streams. I bet I could find I wonder if I can find fan art of that right now

412
00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:56,240
Freddy Krueger lightsaber

413
00:24:56,240 --> 00:25:03,480
What about Sith Caleb? I'm gonna look that up. No, I don't look at all really ready Sith Lord. Yeah. Yeah

414
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:11,960
Is it cool I found a Wikipedia I found a Wikipedia article it's just Wikipedia

415
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:16,200
Caleb. No, that doesn't exist. Yeah, it does.

416
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:21,400
Caleb was a human male healer who resided on the abandoned world of Ambria

417
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:26,720
and he was killed by Darth Zanna in 990 BBY. It sounded like me until you said he was

418
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:33,040
killed. No. It could have been me, honestly, until you said he was being killed.

419
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:39,920
No, I was not killed by my own wife. Not true. You just reminded me I do have to

420
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:45,840
mop the floor before she gets home. Thank you so much. You're welcome. You just

421
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:50,560
actually saved me. Skills and abilities dude. Caleb's healing abilities stem from

422
00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:54,760
the force but it was not like that of the Jedi or the Sith. It came directly

423
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:59,440
from the world around him. Yeah that's me dude. I'm not dead but oh and he was bald.

424
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:05,080
Nope that's Darth Bane. Fuck! There's a lot of people named Patrick on Wikipedia.

00:30:12,420 --> 00:30:13,260
than that voice you just did.

476
00:30:13,260 --> 00:30:15,020
- Okay, let's record it really fast.

477
00:30:15,020 --> 00:30:19,100
Caleb is stupid.

478
00:30:19,100 --> 00:30:19,940
- Oh yeah, 'cause then we speed it up.

479
00:30:19,940 --> 00:30:21,380
- It's weird we spend so much time saying that so slowly.

480
00:30:21,380 --> 00:30:22,360
- Then we speed it up.

481
00:30:22,360 --> 00:30:24,220
If we talk slow.

482
00:30:24,220 --> 00:30:25,380
- No, that was it sped up.

483
00:30:25,380 --> 00:30:27,420
- No, if we talk slow, we can speed it up

484
00:30:27,420 --> 00:30:30,420
and then we can do like patches in the chipmunks.

485
00:30:30,420 --> 00:30:31,260
- I'm gonna walk up to you slow

486
00:30:31,260 --> 00:30:33,340
and then I'm gonna speed up and I'm gonna get you.

487
00:30:33,340 --> 00:30:35,140
- We can do patches in the chipmunks.

488
00:30:35,140 --> 00:30:35,980
- You guys are wankers.

489
00:30:35,980 --> 00:30:38,540
- We talk slow, we speed it up,

490
00:30:38,540 --> 00:30:42,180
And then we do, 'cause I don't know who our Dave Seville would be.

491
00:30:42,180 --> 00:30:42,980
It's me.

492
00:30:42,980 --> 00:30:43,880
No.

493
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:44,620
'Cause you're one of the-

494
00:30:44,620 --> 00:30:45,620
PATRICK!

495
00:30:45,620 --> 00:30:46,420
You're...

496
00:30:46,420 --> 00:30:50,060
No, okay, so it would be Caleb and the Chipmunks, and then...

497
00:30:50,060 --> 00:30:52,900
Patches would be the Dave Seville.

498
00:30:52,900 --> 00:30:54,900
Why are you- what are you doing with your hand?

499
00:30:54,900 --> 00:30:57,420
You really need to move your hand around to figure out who-

500
00:30:57,420 --> 00:30:59,780
He's doing three Chipmunks, one human math.

501
00:30:59,780 --> 00:31:02,340
You're doing like, fucking like, minority report, like-

502
00:31:02,340 --> 00:31:05,620
Yeah, you're doing like, Sherlock Mind Palace shit to figure out-

503
00:31:05,620 --> 00:31:06,580
That's what I'm doing!

504
00:31:06,580 --> 00:31:07,900
That's what I'm doing, I have to figure it out!

505
00:31:07,900 --> 00:31:09,380
- Who would be who? - Three of us.

506
00:31:09,380 --> 00:31:10,940
- There's three of us. - Ooh, ooh.

507
00:31:10,940 --> 00:31:12,540
- It's really hot. - So the three of us

508
00:31:12,540 --> 00:31:13,980
would be the chipmunks.

509
00:31:13,980 --> 00:31:16,660
- You don't have to hold your hand in a three

510
00:31:16,660 --> 00:31:18,180
to know that there's three of us.

511
00:31:18,180 --> 00:31:19,260
- Yes I do.

512
00:31:19,260 --> 00:31:22,300
- He's training for the IQ test.

513
00:31:22,300 --> 00:31:23,220
- Yeah, I am.

514
00:31:23,220 --> 00:31:24,060
- Yeah.

515
00:31:24,060 --> 00:31:27,380
- And I'm gonna win this time.

516
00:31:27,380 --> 00:31:29,300
- Were you one of those kids who during math tests

517
00:31:29,300 --> 00:31:31,260
you would like sit there and talk to yourself?

518
00:31:31,260 --> 00:31:32,100
- No.

519
00:31:32,100 --> 00:31:34,300
- You'd be like, one, two, three.

520
00:31:34,300 --> 00:31:35,900
- I did count on my fingers though.

521
00:31:35,900 --> 00:31:37,620
- No. - But I wouldn't say it out loud.

522
00:31:37,620 --> 00:31:42,260
Really? Yeah. So you just would sit there so inconspicuous just going...

523
00:31:42,260 --> 00:31:49,780
Just wiggling your fingers under your desk. I'm doing very advanced math on your fingers.

524
00:31:49,780 --> 00:31:53,220
I can't do, I just can't do math. I don't know what it is.

525
00:31:53,220 --> 00:31:56,500
You don't know what it is? I know what it is.

526
00:31:56,500 --> 00:31:59,300
Maybe you have lead poisoning too. It's that you're stupid.

527
00:31:59,300 --> 00:32:07,140
No! Come on dude. Pat's smart. Pat, you're smart. Look at me. Look at me.

528
00:32:07,140 --> 00:32:15,140
No, not behind you. Look at me. Look in my eyes. Look at me. Come here. Look at me.

529
00:32:15,140 --> 00:32:18,140
Patrick, turn around. Patrick, look over here.

530
00:32:18,140 --> 00:32:21,140
No, don't look. That's the other direction. Look at me.

531
00:32:21,140 --> 00:32:23,140
Look over here at the camera.

532
00:32:23,140 --> 00:32:26,140
Look at us. I want to tell you how smart you are.

533
00:32:26,140 --> 00:32:30,140
One more. Almost. Almost.

534
00:32:30,140 --> 00:32:36,140
[Laughter]

535
00:32:36,140 --> 00:32:39,900
You're evil dude. Nobody's gonna hear, nobody's gonna see that.

536
00:32:39,900 --> 00:32:41,740
I'm not evil. You are.

537
00:32:41,740 --> 00:32:45,140
How am I evil? You're on your army hammer shit bro.

538
00:32:45,140 --> 00:32:47,620
I'm not on my army hammer shit. I'm the least evil one out of all of us.

539
00:32:47,620 --> 00:32:50,420
Also how could a guy named army hammer not be evil?

540
00:32:50,420 --> 00:32:53,140
Yeah that's true. Did you guys see his DM that said...

00:32:53,140 --> 00:32:55,540
The two most evil things, the army and hammer.

00:32:55,540 --> 00:32:57,540
The army and the hammer. That's true.

543
00:32:57,540 --> 00:33:00,140
Yeah. Did you guys see his DM that got screenshotted

576
00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:04,360
whenever it like someone talks about Satanism and then like the Church of

577
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:09,640
Satan on Twitter is like actually Satanism means having a non-aggression

578
00:36:09,640 --> 00:36:15,660
policy with your neighbor and right when did the Satanist become such a fucking

579
00:36:15,660 --> 00:36:21,100
dork yeah such a pussy. When did Satan become a dork? Back in my day Satanism was some cool ass shit bro.

580
00:36:21,100 --> 00:36:26,540
It just means you're a libertarian now. Satanism meant that you played Pokemon when I was a kid.

581
00:36:26,540 --> 00:36:36,780
Yeah. Satanism was like oh Harry Potter is real? Come on. Satanism is when a guy talks louder than

582
00:36:36,780 --> 00:36:42,060
his normal speaking voice in a song. Yeah that actually is kind of scary to me though. Yeah.

583
00:36:43,020 --> 00:36:45,820
Satanism is when you sing about a wizard.

584
00:36:45,820 --> 00:36:49,200
Yeah, a wizard who smokes weed?

585
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:50,480
Damn, that's double evil.

586
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:51,320
Yeah, oh yeah.

587
00:36:51,320 --> 00:36:52,800
Satanism is when you make a song

588
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:54,680
that's about smoke on the water.

589
00:36:54,680 --> 00:36:57,160
It's like, what, water on fire?

590
00:36:57,160 --> 00:36:58,520
Sounds evil to me.

591
00:36:58,520 --> 00:37:00,760
Back in my day, Satanism was just the Beatles.

592
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:02,960
When they talked about dancing close to a girl

593
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:04,600
or getting a kiss on the cheek.

594
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:06,240
Yeah, that's why he said he's bigger than Christ.

595
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:08,480
Yeah, excuse me, you're going to hell.

596
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:10,320
Yeah, I used to love you.

597
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:11,600
You wanna hold hands?

598
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:12,440
Uh-uh.

599
00:37:12,440 --> 00:37:14,640
Yeah, hold hands with the devil in hell.

600
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:17,520
I used to lock my kids in the basement

601
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:18,560
and ritually abuse them

602
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:20,040
because they would listen to the Beach Boys

603
00:37:20,040 --> 00:37:22,000
and I really don't want that kind of satanic energy

604
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:23,180
in my household.

605
00:37:23,180 --> 00:37:24,760
That's so true.

606
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:26,240
Yeah, this guy's singing about someone

607
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:27,880
eating all of his corn.

608
00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:28,840
That's Satan.

609
00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:30,920
You know who's eating all the corn?

610
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:31,760
Satan.

611
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:32,800
It's the devil.

612
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:33,640
Sleuth John B.

613
00:37:33,640 --> 00:37:34,920
Children of the corn ever see that?

614
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:37,880
If you say Sleuth John B, record it

615
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:38,840
and then play it in reverse,

616
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:39,680
you know what it says?

617
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:40,500
The devil.

618
00:37:40,500 --> 00:37:45,260
That's why every court case is kind of about like understanding what kind of video games,

619
00:37:45,260 --> 00:37:46,820
movies, and music somebody likes.

620
00:37:46,820 --> 00:37:50,380
And if they like devil-y stuff, they go to jail.

621
00:37:50,380 --> 00:37:53,500
That's why Casey Anthony went free because she liked pop music.

622
00:37:53,500 --> 00:37:54,500
She liked Britney Spears.

623
00:37:54,500 --> 00:37:57,380
She liked the office and shit, you know.

624
00:37:57,380 --> 00:38:04,580
She liked good, normal, Christian shit like that, you know.

625
00:38:04,580 --> 00:38:05,580
It's just common sense.

626
00:38:05,580 --> 00:38:10,160
That is kind of the gauge for whether something is satanic or like good.

627
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:14,160
it whether Casey Anthony would like it yeah true cuz she's that border between

628
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:19,120
bad and good yeah she's like kind of the exact line bad meats yeah yeah cuz she's

629
00:38:19,120 --> 00:38:25,680
hot good and then she lost she lost her kid what yeah she put her kid in toys r

00:39:48,200 --> 00:39:51,760
as she keeps it tight she's innocent the second that she becomes ugly she's going

645
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:56,160

00:40:27,240 --> 00:40:33,720
being like "that's horrible!" when I was like six and then Casey Anthony because my mom was

Jeb for one.

657
00:40:46,840 --> 00:40:48,840
Wouldn't let her die.

658
00:40:48,840 --> 00:40:49,840
Yeah.

659
00:40:49,840 --> 00:40:50,840

00:40:52,840 --> 00:40:56,840
Just keep her alive long enough until you can do the like, you can inject her with like

663
00:40:56,840 --> 00:40:59,960
the shit that Bane breathes.

664
00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:00,960
You know?

665
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:01,960
Just turn her into like some fucking...

666
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:04,360
Get a Bane mask on her.

667
00:41:04,360 --> 00:41:05,760
Yeah.

668
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:06,760
That is, that's...

669
00:41:06,760 --> 00:41:14,520
Dude, I bet you like it'd be so cool if all the rich people who get like cryogenically

670
00:41:14,520 --> 00:41:20,120
frozen to like survive diseases or whatever like Walt Disney and shit and like a hundred

671
00:41:20,120 --> 00:41:25,040
or like in like a thousand years when the like the next civilization or whatever is

672
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:28,680
super advanced is going to find them and not remember who they were and just use them as

673
00:41:28,680 --> 00:41:29,680
clone troopers.

674
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:31,940
(laughter)

675
00:41:31,940 --> 00:41:36,080
- Just put like, gain masks on them

676
00:41:36,080 --> 00:41:37,540
and like, space marine armor.

677
00:41:37,540 --> 00:41:38,760
(laughter)

678
00:41:38,760 --> 00:41:41,280
- Just some guy with a mid-Atlantic accent.

679
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:42,720
(laughter)

680
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:44,480
- Wow, take this, you alien bastards!

681
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:46,720
(laughter)

682
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:48,680
- Yeah.

683
00:41:48,680 --> 00:41:51,200
- That's what I pray will happen, that would be so sick.

684
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:53,240
- Dude, that's the scariest thing you can think of,

685
00:41:53,240 --> 00:41:54,760
a soldier with imagination.

686
00:41:54,760 --> 00:41:56,200
- Imagine you're like a Mars separatist,

687
00:41:56,200 --> 00:42:01,960
and like fucking like like John Rockefeller comes and stomps your shit out like a spiked

688
00:42:01,960 --> 00:42:09,600
boot. I like to imagine a less violent future where they're just used as like coolers for

689
00:42:09,600 --> 00:42:15,600
like cool beers that you're drinking. Yeah. Yeah. They just stick a fucking six pack a

690
00:42:15,600 --> 00:42:22,920
six or a Coors Light Walt Disney's abdomen. Yeah. They auction them off. Yeah. Be so sick.

691
00:42:22,920 --> 00:42:23,760
I'm looking forward to it.

692
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:25,400
You guys gonna freeze yourselves?

693
00:42:25,400 --> 00:42:26,240
Maybe.

694
00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:27,500
Only if I get really sick.

695
00:42:27,500 --> 00:42:29,180
Which would you rather do, freeze yourself

696
00:42:29,180 --> 00:42:31,740
or upload your brain to the internet?

697
00:42:31,740 --> 00:42:33,760
Probably upload my brain.

698
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:36,960
But you have to use a girl avatar on the internet.

699
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:39,260
I'd rather freeze myself

700
00:42:39,260 --> 00:42:41,360
than upload myself to the internet.

701
00:42:41,360 --> 00:42:42,960
Hmm.

702
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:43,800
Why?

703
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:47,040
You just like gold.

704
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:49,480
No, it's just like if you upload yourself to,

705
00:42:49,480 --> 00:42:53,840
Like what if you just, what if you lose internet?

706
00:42:53,840 --> 00:42:55,440
True.

707
00:42:55,440 --> 00:42:56,280
Well.

708
00:42:56,280 --> 00:42:58,700
Or what if like you, what if you get an ad?

709
00:42:58,700 --> 00:42:59,540
Yeah, that's true.

710
00:42:59,540 --> 00:43:00,740
What if you get like adware or something?

711
00:43:00,740 --> 00:43:02,040
Yeah, that's a really good point.

712
00:43:02,040 --> 00:43:02,880
I'd rather just be in my body.

713
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:04,200
I guess I'd freeze myself too.

714
00:43:04,200 --> 00:43:05,760
Yeah.

715
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:06,920
Is there a third option?

716
00:43:06,920 --> 00:43:08,520
Can I encase myself in lava?

717
00:43:08,520 --> 00:43:10,560
Or would you rather just live forever normally

718
00:43:10,560 --> 00:43:12,440
and have no negative things happen to you ever?

719
00:43:12,440 --> 00:43:13,280
I got an idea.

720
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:14,100
Would you rather freeze yourself,

721
00:43:14,100 --> 00:43:15,960
be the internet, or just be God?

722
00:43:15,960 --> 00:43:18,280
I got a, would you rather

723
00:43:18,280 --> 00:43:24,680
freeze yourself or no you upload your brain to the computer and then you

724
00:43:24,680 --> 00:43:28,680
freeze the computer. What if the computer freezes? Or go on vacation?

725
00:43:28,680 --> 00:43:34,880
Oh, probably go on vacation honestly. Yeah. If I'm being completely honest.

726
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:39,760
Would you rather, okay, would you rather freeze yourself or freeze yourself, would

727
00:43:39,760 --> 00:43:42,680
you rather freeze yourself and it cost a thousand dollars or freeze yourself and

728
00:43:42,680 --> 00:43:47,160
it cost nine hundred dollars? A thousand dollars because I want my money to

729
00:43:47,160 --> 00:43:52,000
to increase over time yeah would you rather interest would you rather freeze

730
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:57,960
yourself or freeze Terry Shivo I would like to freeze her and replace all those

731
00:43:57,960 --> 00:44:02,920
like Civil War statues with her okay yeah like in Richmond and shit all that like

732
00:44:02,920 --> 00:44:16,180
Robert E. Lee shit. They just replaced all the... Terry Shivo just a bunch of metal Terry Shivos. Goddamn. I hope we don't have like a

733
00:44:16,180 --> 00:44:22,000
Ghostbusters situation where all this shit comes to life. Well actually it wouldn't be that bad.

734
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:29,680
Now that I think about it. Probably would barely notice. That might be the one defense against

735
00:44:29,680 --> 00:44:36,680
ghost invading New York City. Is this Terry Shivo? All statues, billboards with Terry Shivo.

736
00:44:36,680 --> 00:44:42,320
Instead Dan Akerate accidentally, I thought of the one thing, he actually

737
00:44:42,320 --> 00:44:45,840
instead of the stave puffed marshmallow man he thinks of Terry Shivo. Yeah what the

738
00:44:45,840 --> 00:44:50,840
fuck you gonna haunt now dude? You're stuck either way dumbass ghost. Who outsmarted you?

739
00:44:50,840 --> 00:44:56,560
Yeah Jeb Bush ruined that family's life. Yeah.

740
00:44:56,560 --> 00:45:01,160
I wasn't I think didn't she drowned in a pool ruin their life

741
00:45:01,160 --> 00:45:05,240
well that did too I think the pools I think it's a combination of a pool and

742
00:45:05,240 --> 00:45:09,240
it was Jeb Bush's pool definitely Jeb Bush and pools are the two worst things

743
00:45:09,240 --> 00:45:12,840
to those people in Florida the two worst things because there's so many beaches

744
00:45:12,840 --> 00:45:18,040
why would you need a pool yeah exactly and the water bath bath water warm mm-hmm

745
00:45:18,040 --> 00:45:19,040
Yeah.

746
00:45:19,040 --> 00:45:20,040
Oh boy.

747
00:45:20,040 --> 00:45:25,520
Damn, a little Terry Shivo rewind for us.

748
00:45:25,520 --> 00:45:30,440
What else happened in 2004 or whatever?

749
00:45:30,440 --> 00:45:31,800
Jerry Shivo?

750
00:45:31,800 --> 00:45:33,840
Jerry Shivo, yeah.

751
00:45:33,840 --> 00:45:37,080
He was Jerry Shivo, lived a long and fulfilling life.

752
00:45:37,080 --> 00:45:39,680
Yep, he walked all his life.

753
00:45:39,680 --> 00:45:41,440
And he died.

754
00:45:41,440 --> 00:45:44,840
Let's see, I'm just gonna Google 2004.

755
00:45:44,840 --> 00:45:45,840

Japan 4.

765

00:46:10,760 --> 00:46:12,880
I don't know why Terry Shivo is the,

772
00:46:12,880 --> 00:46:14,360
well that wasn't 2004, was it?

773

00:46:33,640 --> 00:46:40,040
by the government that's a very she was executed by military tribunal along with

I saw something, something--

782
00:46:51,180 --> 00:46:52,760
What do you mean?

00:46:52,760 --> 00:46:54,320
They took out the feeding tube.

784
00:46:54,320 --> 00:46:55,480
That's an execution?

785
00:46:55,480 --> 00:46:57,520
I guess, you're right, yeah.

786
00:46:57,520 --> 00:47:00,020
I guess, I saw something on like,

787
00:47:00,020 --> 00:47:02,680
my Instagram explore page the other day

788
00:47:02,680 --> 00:47:05,560

like the hand from ocarina of time that like the floor yeah that's scary in the

858
00:52:21,080 --> 00:52:24,000
- In the South, it's all just, it's funny,

859
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:28,480
all the antique stores are full of racist memorabilia.

860
00:52:28,480 --> 00:52:30,040
None of that shit makes it to Goodwill,

861
00:52:30,040 --> 00:52:32,240
'cause those people are getting paid for that.

862
00:52:32,240 --> 00:52:33,320
- Yeah? - Yeah.

863
00:52:33,320 --> 00:52:34,800
- Like line jockeys and stuff?

864
00:52:34,800 --> 00:52:39,800
- Yeah, yeah, and like an Aunt Jemima fucking jar

865
00:52:39,800 --> 00:52:41,200
or something.

866
00:52:41,200 --> 00:52:42,600
- Oh, where she looks like a Sambo?

867
00:52:42,600 --> 00:52:45,080
- Yeah, like the one that Liz Warren has.

868
00:52:45,080 --> 00:52:45,920
- Yeah. - Yeah.

869
00:52:45,920 --> 00:52:49,480
Like all that shit, that just, only in antique stores.

870
00:52:49,480 --> 00:52:51,240
You can't get that discount.

871
00:52:51,240 --> 00:52:52,080
Yeah.

872
00:52:52,080 --> 00:52:54,280
Yeah, but then the discount store, like Goodwill,

873
00:52:54,280 --> 00:52:57,240
I got like a bunch of bapes there one time.

874
00:52:57,240 --> 00:52:59,160
Oh yeah, your fucking, your fake bapes

875
00:52:59,160 --> 00:53:00,000
that are like peeling?

876
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:01,640
They're real!

877
00:53:01,640 --> 00:53:03,800
If they were real, they wouldn't be peeling like that.

878
00:53:03,800 --> 00:53:06,840
I got 'em at Goodwill, here's my idea.

879
00:53:06,840 --> 00:53:11,280
I think a really, really rich guy died

880
00:53:11,280 --> 00:53:12,720
and then his mom was like,

881
00:53:12,720 --> 00:53:14,560
these shoes look like they're for kids

882
00:53:14,560 --> 00:53:16,640
and gave 'em to Goodwill.

883
00:53:16,640 --> 00:53:18,520
But they're real, come on dude.

884
00:53:18,520 --> 00:53:19,360
I don't know.

885
00:53:19,360 --> 00:53:21,400
They're completely fallen apart.

886
00:53:21,400 --> 00:53:23,000
The patent leather just like,

887
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:25,920
it comes off like a screen protector.

888
00:53:25,920 --> 00:53:28,100
It's, they're real.

889
00:53:28,100 --> 00:53:29,820
- I don't know about that.

890
00:53:29,820 --> 00:53:32,080
- Yeah, dude, they're called Bakestas.

891
00:53:32,080 --> 00:53:34,320
(laughing)

892
00:53:34,320 --> 00:53:36,080
They're called Bapers,

893
00:53:36,080 --> 00:53:37,960
and they're the realest shoe that there is.

894
00:53:37,960 --> 00:53:39,920
- Yeah, dude, they're real, they're babes.

895
00:53:39,920 --> 00:53:42,520
- Yeah, hot babes, come on.

896
00:53:42,520 --> 00:53:44,880
Everybody loves those shoes, dude.

897
00:53:44,880 --> 00:53:45,720
And how real they are.

898
00:53:45,720 --> 00:53:47,680
- I have the Pabes, come on.

899
00:53:47,680 --> 00:53:48,880
I got really into--

900
00:53:48,880 --> 00:53:50,680
- I paid his Japanese for Bapesta.

901
00:53:50,680 --> 00:53:53,720
- I wanted to get bapes when I was like 14.

902
00:53:53,720 --> 00:53:55,320
And I got really into looking through

903
00:53:55,320 --> 00:53:57,920
like the Chinese wholesale websites

904
00:53:57,920 --> 00:54:01,280

905
00:54:01,280 --> 00:54:03,900
or like stuff like supremebape.net.

906
00:54:03,900 --> 00:54:07,960
It's just like the fakest shit you could ever fucking see.

907
00:54:07,960 --> 00:54:12,080
- Back when there was the zip up hoodies were really popular.

908
00:54:12,080 --> 00:54:14,100
One time I asked my mom for one for Christmas

909
00:54:14,100 --> 00:54:16,180
and of course they were like way too expensive.

910
00:54:16,180 --> 00:54:17,720
But my mom told me that they were just too,

911
00:54:17,720 --> 00:54:24,960

913
00:54:29,400 --> 00:54:32,320
I mean it's a good way to like if somebody's chasing you just zip it up

00:58:35,620 --> 00:58:46,820
"All right, I'll take it." There was a guy at the liquor store I worked with who, he

959
00:58:46,820 --> 00:58:52,820
was, he had some kind of sports autism or something. He would, whenever he wasn't

00:58:52,820 --> 00:58:56,940
doing anything, he would just start like miming playing sports. Like he would just

961
00:58:56,940 --> 00:59:00,700
like swing pretend to be swinging a baseball bat or like throwing a football

That's a good point. Yeah, that's just exactly what they do.

They just hear the frying pan hit the ground.

01:00:36,480 --> 01:00:41,840
They hear the sizzle of the oil. Yeah. And they jump on the frying pan like a

987
01:00:41,840 --> 01:00:47,040
human shield. Yeah. They see a Chinese tourist walk into the McDonald's and

988
01:00:47,040 --> 01:00:50,800
their manager has to grab their arm to keep them from throwing the fry oil over

989
01:00:50,800 --> 01:00:59,040
the counter. Yeah. I wish, I hope I become one of those guys one day. I hope I get

990
01:00:59,040 --> 01:01:02,920
drafted into a war. I hope there's some way for me to become a veteran. Me too.

991
01:01:02,920 --> 01:01:03,760
- I do, yeah.

992
01:01:03,760 --> 01:01:04,600
- I wanna be a veteran so bad.

993
01:01:04,600 --> 01:01:06,320
- I feel like I might be past my prime,

994
01:01:06,320 --> 01:01:10,200
but I feel like veteran is, that's like, you know.

995
01:01:10,200 --> 01:01:11,040
- The coolest thing you can do.

996
01:01:11,040 --> 01:01:14,000
- Dude, I'm too old to be in the military,

997
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:15,820
but I'm too young to be a veteran.

998
01:01:15,820 --> 01:01:16,660
- Yeah. - Damn.

999
01:01:16,660 --> 01:01:17,480
- To think about it.

1000
01:01:17,480 --> 01:01:19,160
- Born too early to-- - I'm gonna become a veteran.

1001
01:01:19,160 --> 01:01:21,360
- Born too late to fucking fight in Iraq.

1002
01:01:21,360 --> 01:01:22,560
- Yeah, born too early to--

1003
01:01:22,560 --> 01:01:25,000
- To early to scream at a woman in McDonald's

1004
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:25,840
and push her over.

1005
01:01:25,840 --> 01:01:27,080
- Born too early to fight in Iraq,

1006
01:01:27,080 --> 01:01:29,080
like the third time we're there.

1007
01:01:29,080 --> 01:01:30,720
- Yeah. - It's coming, buddy.

1008
01:01:30,720 --> 01:01:31,920
- Yeah. - Yeah.

1009
01:01:31,920 --> 01:01:40,560
2021 baby. Unfortunately, I will be a protected celebrity by then. Yeah. Yeah. Because I'll

1010
01:01:40,560 --> 01:01:45,560
have my movie debut. I'm picking up. Unfortunately, everyone will love me. I'll be too cherished

1011
01:01:45,560 --> 01:01:51,000
to go to war. Exactly. Nobody will even. Basically, they won't send me to war because even the

1012
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:54,560
people on the other side will like me so much it would just like bring the war to a standstill.

1013
01:01:54,560 --> 01:02:00,320
Oh, I'll be doing Bob Hope shit for the other side. I'll be doing Benny Hill type stuff,

1014
01:02:00,320 --> 01:02:04,880
dude and I would be making I be making Isis laugh their asses off. Wait isn't it

1015
01:02:04,880 --> 01:02:13,160
in like... I'm gonna become Bob Hope for Isis. Isn't it in Korea like all the k-pop stars have to

1016
01:02:13,160 --> 01:02:17,720
serve in the military because it's like compulsory? That shit rules dude.

1017
01:02:17,720 --> 01:02:22,920
Imagine just like they keep just like they try to do like a Paul McCartney

1018
01:02:22,920 --> 01:02:28,000
like clone replacement thing and then the clone dies and they have to do it

1019
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:30,720
over and over again and then it just looks progressively

1020
01:02:30,720 --> 01:02:33,320
less like him and just like some normal white actor

1021
01:02:33,320 --> 01:02:35,860
they got to play the new clone.

1022
01:02:35,860 --> 01:02:37,560
That'd be cool.

1023
01:02:37,560 --> 01:02:38,720
That would be kinda cool.

1024
01:02:38,720 --> 01:02:41,240
But that'll be me.

1025
01:02:41,240 --> 01:02:42,080
Yeah.

1026
01:02:42,080 --> 01:02:43,120
All right, I have to go pee pee.

1027
01:02:43,120 --> 01:02:43,960
Yeah, me too.

1028
01:02:43,960 --> 01:02:44,920

1029
01:02:44,920 --> 01:02:45,760
