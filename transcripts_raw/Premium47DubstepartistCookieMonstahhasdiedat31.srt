Impression. Yeah. Yeah, this is a

55
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:39,440
Impression of somebody you guys this is mr. Cinnamon

I love you, Donald!

57
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:49,040

63
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:02,520
I'm from Jamaica!

64
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:06,040
I'm from Jamaica, that's why I sound like this!

65
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:07,680
Is there cinnamon in Jamaica?

66
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:08,680
I don't know.

67
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:14,680
don't make it there. No. They only make it, they have to make it from the challenge.

68
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:19,720
Cinnamon comes from the store. Yeah, they make it in the back of the store in the room

69
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:23,560
I'm not allowed to go in. When I try to go in the room they yell at me, I know it's because

70
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:26,600
they're making cinnamon back there. They want me to think it comes from Jamaica. Is cinnamon

71
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:33,360
grown on a tree? Yeah. Is it a Christmas tree? You get cinnamon from the Christmas tree.

72
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:36,720
That's true. Cinnamon is what happens when it snows in the desert and when it touches

73
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:40,020
the ground it turns into cinnamon. It is kind of it does make sense that he's

74
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:43,740
Jamaican because he does it cinnamon looks like a... Well because he's Cinnamon.

75
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:48,860
Let's be honest. Yeah that's what I was trying to... I knew the reason why he was Jamaican.

76
00:04:48,860 --> 00:04:54,500
I was like no it can't be that. No dude, Cinnamon is Jamaican. The apple is...

77
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:58,500
Cinnamon is the Winnemon. He's a goblin. That's what he said. He's a... the apple is just a

78
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:04,260
little evil... The apple goblin. The apple demon. The apple demon genes. It's scary dude. I think that

79
00:05:04,260 --> 00:05:10,140

80
00:05:10,140 --> 00:05:17,820

00:07:58,580 --> 00:08:03,620
Walk around. We should take down the mafia. We should go to the Times Square Jollibee. You wanna do that? We gotta go.

117
00:08:03,620 --> 00:08:07,700
Hold on. Look at dude he's on the mic in the fridge. Nobody's ever. God damn.

118
00:08:07,700 --> 00:08:11,580
We're breaking barriers here. I know. Dude this is Orson Welles shit. I just fucking opened the

119
00:08:11,580 --> 00:08:15,860
fridge and got a beer for Patrick while recording. Yeah. Oh my god. This is why I told

120
00:08:15,860 --> 00:08:17,860
This is why I wanted us to sit here.

121
00:08:17,860 --> 00:08:18,860
This is, yeah.

122
00:08:18,860 --> 00:08:22,700
I'm the genius of mic placements on the show.

123
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:23,700
This would be a good trip.

124
00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:24,700
This is a...

125
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:25,700
Yeah.

126
00:08:25,700 --> 00:08:26,700
Because we were just talking about how we're...

127
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:27,700
We don't all get COVID.

128
00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:28,700
I mean, if fucking Trump got it.

129
00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:29,700
We'll try.

130
00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:30,700
I mean, yeah, it doesn't...

131
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:35,460
But it is funny that just all of the world will change so much by the time we record

132
00:08:35,460 --> 00:08:36,460
another episode.

133
00:08:36,460 --> 00:08:37,460
Oh, yeah.

134
00:08:37,460 --> 00:08:38,460
We're about to backlog like eight episodes while the president is dying.

135
00:08:38,460 --> 00:08:39,460
Yeah, right?

136
00:08:39,460 --> 00:08:42,020
We're not going to record another one until after the election.

137
00:08:42,020 --> 00:08:43,020
I know.

138
00:08:43,020 --> 00:08:44,020
It's so fucked.

139
00:08:44,020 --> 00:08:45,020
The president will be dead.

140
00:08:45,020 --> 00:08:48,020
What else is going to happen between now and then?

141
00:08:48,020 --> 00:08:53,020
Joe Biden. Joe Biden will breakdance on Oprah.

142
00:08:53,020 --> 00:08:58,020
Joe Biden's going to go on Oprah and he's going to jump on her couch like Tom Cruise.

143
00:08:58,020 --> 00:09:03,020
It's so crazy how can you get excited about what's coming up.

144
00:09:03,020 --> 00:09:05,020
Like the whole set up.

145
00:09:05,020 --> 00:09:08,020
Christmas. Oh, fuck.

146
00:09:08,020 --> 00:09:11,020
I forgot about that. Come on. What are you talking about, dude?

147
00:09:11,020 --> 00:09:14,020
If Trump wins, we're definitely going to have a white Christmas.

148
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:16,020
"Let's go!"

149
00:09:16,020 --> 00:09:18,020
Now that I'm in New York, I gotta go try this.

150
00:09:18,020 --> 00:09:20,020
Say "Orange Christmas."

151
00:09:20,020 --> 00:09:22,020
No, because he's a white supremacist.

152
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:24,020
Say "Orange Christmas."

153
00:09:24,020 --> 00:09:26,020
Or we're gonna have a white Christmas.

154
00:09:26,020 --> 00:09:28,020
Or an orange Christmas.

155
00:09:28,020 --> 00:09:30,020
Get me to the fucking pit right now.

156
00:09:30,020 --> 00:09:32,020
I'm doing their open mic.

157
00:09:32,020 --> 00:09:34,020
We're taking him down.

158
00:09:34,020 --> 00:09:36,020
Do we know where the Babylon B headquarters are?

159
00:09:36,020 --> 00:09:38,020
Can we get Patrick Shift in there?

160
00:09:38,020 --> 00:09:40,020
Let's get me into the Babylon.

161
00:09:40,020 --> 00:09:42,020
We just gotta get him in a meeting. He'll kill.

162
00:09:42,020 --> 00:09:46,340
him in front of someone. He's a sergeant of sarcasm first class. I'd be very good as a

163
00:09:46,340 --> 00:09:53,220
very bad New York comedian. The best part of him. I can tell because you keep tossling your hair.

164
00:09:53,220 --> 00:10:00,420
That's true. Yeah you got a messy mop top. Yeah. Yeah this mullet's not been working out as great.

165
00:10:00,420 --> 00:10:05,460
It looks good. I think it looks good dude. My cousin, I saw, I ran into my cousin at Walmart.

166
00:10:05,460 --> 00:10:11,220
Such a great start to a story. Ran into my cousin at Walmart, my six foot five cousin,

167
00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:19,380
And he was like, "I don't want to brag, don't want to brag. The other one that was there was 6'8".

168
00:10:19,380 --> 00:10:25,140
Whoa. I have one 6'5 cousin and one 6'8 cousin. You got the wrong parents.

169
00:10:25,140 --> 00:10:31,300
Yeah. Yeah. No, dude, your stork picked the wrong family. He got swapped out at the hospital.

170
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:34,260
Oh man, I don't want to be that tall. Can you imagine if Patrick was 6'8"?

171
00:10:34,260 --> 00:10:37,220
Right? Current body type too.

172
00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:40,020
You would honestly, you would make a good tall guy.

173
00:10:40,020 --> 00:10:41,540
You'd be fucking unstoppable, dude.

174
00:10:41,540 --> 00:10:42,100
It's true.

175
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:43,060
If I was tall, like...

176
00:10:43,060 --> 00:10:44,340
You'd be just dominating.

177
00:10:44,340 --> 00:10:44,980
Oh yeah.

178
00:10:44,980 --> 00:10:46,820
You'd be like a fucking Uruk-hai, dude.

179
00:10:46,820 --> 00:10:47,700
You would just be...

180
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:48,260
Yeah, that too.

181
00:10:48,260 --> 00:10:48,580
That's true.

182
00:10:48,580 --> 00:10:52,260
I do have a tall guy personality, I guess.

183
00:10:52,260 --> 00:10:54,020
Is that what you think?

184
00:10:54,020 --> 00:10:55,780
I have the personality of a tall man.

185
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:58,100
It is funny.

186
00:10:58,100 --> 00:11:01,300
It is funny that tall guys just get like a bonus.

187
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:02,180
Right.

188
00:11:02,180 --> 00:11:03,700
They just wake up and they're like, "Damn, I'm tall as fuck."

189
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:08,700
Oh, but I saw my cousins and then my taller cousin,

190
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:10,900
or the least tall one, the 6'5" one,

191
00:11:10,900 --> 00:11:13,340
looked at me and said, "Oh, did you do that yourself?"

192
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:14,180
I was like, "Yeah, I did."

193
00:11:14,180 --> 00:11:15,780
And he was like, "Oh yeah, I couldn't tell.

194
00:11:15,780 --> 00:11:17,300
"I mean, one side's higher than the other."

195
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:18,140
And I was like, "No!

196
00:11:18,140 --> 00:11:19,980
"No!

197
00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:20,980
"Why did you do that to me?"

198
00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:22,780
You should've told him noticing--

199
00:11:22,780 --> 00:11:26,180
Hey man, I can see your penis from right here.

200
00:11:26,180 --> 00:11:27,020
Hey man, hey man.

201
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:28,260
I see your penis, it's in my mouth.

202
00:11:28,260 --> 00:11:29,640
Yeah, it's eye level.

203
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:31,800
It is fine.

204
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:33,140
Hey man, how come your penis is shorter

205
00:11:33,140 --> 00:11:34,100
than the rest of you.

206
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:36,860
- I've never ever noticed anybody's haircut.

207
00:11:36,860 --> 00:11:37,700
- Yeah? - No.

208
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:38,980
That's how straight I am.

209
00:11:38,980 --> 00:11:40,060
- Yeah? - Yeah.

210
00:11:40,060 --> 00:11:42,140
I have no ability to, I mean--

211
00:11:42,140 --> 00:11:42,980
- I would look at--

212
00:11:42,980 --> 00:11:46,180
- You could have came in with like a Madagascar 3

213
00:11:46,180 --> 00:11:49,220
fucking colorful afro and I would not have blinked an eye.

214
00:11:49,220 --> 00:11:50,380
- Okay. - I would have been like,

215
00:11:50,380 --> 00:11:52,980
it's kind of offensive, but it's cool.

216
00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:54,380
To clowns. - Oh, you think it's--

217
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:55,540
- Yeah. - Yeah.

218
00:11:55,540 --> 00:11:57,540
- Yeah, why do clowns pick the afro?

219
00:11:57,540 --> 00:12:00,180
- I wonder.

220
00:12:00,180 --> 00:12:06,260
I wonder what, you know, what comedy tradition had to do with putting makeup all over your

221
00:12:06,260 --> 00:12:08,740
face and acting crazy on stage.

222
00:12:08,740 --> 00:12:10,700
I don't know what you're alluding to.

223
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:13,340
We're taking down clowns now.

224
00:12:13,340 --> 00:12:17,100
Yeah, is clowns just like, did people just become Irish?

225
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:19,100
Yeah, no, clowns grew out.

226
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:22,340
It's like a mix of Irish and minstrel shit.

227
00:12:22,340 --> 00:12:23,340
Yeah.

228
00:12:23,340 --> 00:12:24,340
That makes sense.

229
00:12:24,340 --> 00:12:25,340
That's why their faces are white.

230
00:12:25,340 --> 00:12:26,340
Yeah, that's why they do like the red lips and shit, dude.

231
00:12:26,340 --> 00:12:27,340
Their penises are pitch black.

232
00:12:27,340 --> 00:12:28,340
Oh my god, now I hate clowns.

233
00:12:28,340 --> 00:12:30,340
Now I have a reason to hate clowns.

234
00:12:30,340 --> 00:12:30,840
Yeah.

235
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:34,340
That's why they always have that clown bit where they're dunking, dude.

236
00:12:34,340 --> 00:12:35,340
Yeah.

237
00:12:35,340 --> 00:12:37,340
The dunking clown.

238
00:12:37,340 --> 00:12:39,340
That's what they do with the dunk tank.

239
00:12:39,340 --> 00:12:47,340
Do you guys remember like ten years ago there was this like...

240
00:12:47,340 --> 00:12:48,340
There was a scary clown.

241
00:12:48,340 --> 00:12:50,340
There was a really scary clown in my room.

242
00:12:50,340 --> 00:12:53,340
You guys remember that?

243
00:12:53,340 --> 00:12:54,340
Yeah.

244
00:12:54,340 --> 00:12:55,340
His name was Evil Bobo.

245
00:12:55,340 --> 00:12:56,340
Yeah.

246
00:12:56,340 --> 00:12:57,340
And let me tell you...

247
00:12:57,340 --> 00:12:59,340
Let me tell you. Good Bobo hated him.

248
00:12:59,340 --> 00:13:01,340
[Laughter]

249
00:13:01,340 --> 00:13:04,340
No, there was like this thing where actors were doing like clowning.

250
00:13:04,340 --> 00:13:06,340
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

251
00:13:06,340 --> 00:13:08,340
You remember that shit? Yeah, like Sasha Baron Cohen.

252
00:13:08,340 --> 00:13:10,340
Dude, prestige clowning. Yeah.

253
00:13:10,340 --> 00:13:12,340
It's the most embarrassing thing I can think of.

254
00:13:12,340 --> 00:13:14,340
People still fucking do it out of like...

255
00:13:14,340 --> 00:13:16,340
When I was working at UCB... People will go to fucking NYU and then graduate and become a clown.

256
00:13:16,340 --> 00:13:20,340
It's so funny. I got invited by someone I worked with at UCB.

257
00:13:20,340 --> 00:13:24,340
She was like, "You should come watch my clown show. You'll really like it."

258
00:13:24,340 --> 00:13:28,180
I was like, what is it? She's like, basically we just like find ourselves on stage.

259
00:13:28,180 --> 00:13:28,680
Yeah.

260
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:30,680
I'm like, that's not what a clown does.

261
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:33,380
The only clown I respect is a clown who has the...

262
00:13:33,380 --> 00:13:35,720
Bitch, you better be finding yourself in a small ass car.

263
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:37,220
[Laughter]

264
00:13:37,220 --> 00:13:38,220
Real shit.

265
00:13:38,220 --> 00:13:40,480
You ain't no goddamn clown.

266
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:42,860
You're a clown in the metaphorical sense for sure.

267
00:13:42,860 --> 00:13:47,480
A modern clown who has the balls to like abduct and kill children in today's climate, you know?

268
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:48,480
I mean, that's beast mode.

269
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:50,480
When clowns are already being hated on all the time.

270
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:51,980
Dude, Johnathan is going to get it.

271
00:13:51,980 --> 00:13:53,980
I had such a primal...

272
00:13:53,980 --> 00:13:55,420
I had a primal fear.

273
00:13:55,420 --> 00:13:56,420
Pogo the Clown?

274
00:13:56,420 --> 00:13:57,420
Isn't that John Gacy?

275
00:13:57,420 --> 00:13:58,420
Yeah.

276
00:13:58,420 --> 00:14:00,540
Why did he get the middle name privilege?

277
00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:01,980
Why does everybody hit him with the middle name?

278
00:14:01,980 --> 00:14:03,420
Every serial killer gets a middle name.

279
00:14:03,420 --> 00:14:04,420
Jeffrey Elizabeth Dahmer.

280
00:14:04,420 --> 00:14:06,220
His middle name's Elizabeth?

281
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:07,220
That explains a lot I guess.

282
00:14:07,220 --> 00:14:08,220
Yeah.

283
00:14:08,220 --> 00:14:09,220
Yeah.

284
00:14:09,220 --> 00:14:10,220
Well he was, you know.

285
00:14:10,220 --> 00:14:11,220
Yeah.

286
00:14:11,220 --> 00:14:12,220
Yeah.

287
00:14:12,220 --> 00:14:13,220
He was.

288
00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:14,220
Yeah.

289
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:15,220
The middle name turned him gay.

290
00:14:15,220 --> 00:14:19,340
Your honor, my client was a girl during all of those murders.

291
00:14:19,340 --> 00:14:20,340
That's the Psycho movie.

292
00:14:20,340 --> 00:14:23,340
The psychiatrist looks at his name and goes, "Oh!"

293
00:14:23,340 --> 00:14:27,900
guys guys he has a split personality it's just a girl just fucking he's just don't

00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:18,900
last that last Frankenstein volt that moves my muscles up and down.

315
00:16:18,900 --> 00:16:19,900
That's right.

316
00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:20,900
I'm gonna blow.

317
00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:21,900
You fucking guessed it dude.

318
00:16:21,900 --> 00:16:23,500
I'm gonna come in my mouth.

319
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:25,380
Do you think any subway masturbators...

320
00:16:25,380 --> 00:16:32,900
Can you imagine a guy in the electric chair getting zapped and he just spontaneously comes

321
00:16:32,900 --> 00:16:35,900
into his mouth as he dies?

322
00:16:35,900 --> 00:16:38,900
And it saves him?

323
00:16:38,900 --> 00:16:45,900
His final reflex is just fucking posting a load into his own mouth.

324
00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:48,900
He just has a wry smile.

325
00:16:48,900 --> 00:16:50,900
I'm still alive, bitch.

326
00:16:50,900 --> 00:16:53,900
His last words, "You asked for this, America."

327
00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:56,900
His last words, "I'm gonna come in my own mouth."

328
00:16:56,900 --> 00:16:59,900
Yeah, we didn't believe him and it happened.

329
00:16:59,900 --> 00:17:02,900
It's a Christmas miracle.

330
00:17:02,900 --> 00:17:06,900
Anyway, I went home that night and shot myself in the foot.

331
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:09,140
(laughing)

332
00:17:09,140 --> 00:17:10,600
Just to feel something after that.

333
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:12,740
- Imagine a guy who tries to commit suicide

334
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:16,540
by shooting himself once in the foot.

335
00:17:16,540 --> 00:17:18,900
He's like, "I thought that's where my brain was.

336
00:17:18,900 --> 00:17:20,820
"I must be really stupid."

337
00:17:20,820 --> 00:17:24,400
- I wanted to see if it would hurt before I did it.

338
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:30,020
- I remember, yeah, my mom telling me

339
00:17:30,020 --> 00:17:31,780
that people who are decapitated,

340
00:17:31,780 --> 00:17:35,940
They have like a couple thoughts before they actually die.

341
00:17:35,940 --> 00:17:37,980
Yeah, I still live in fear of that.

342
00:17:37,980 --> 00:17:41,300
Oh, I just remembered this stupid fucking thing.

343
00:17:41,300 --> 00:17:43,820
But I when I was like, I got decapitated when I was 10.

344
00:17:43,820 --> 00:17:48,700
I did. It took them a long time to put it back on.

345
00:17:48,700 --> 00:18:01,760
No, when I was like 10, my mom told me there was like, you know, when you like put like paint on like the side of your hand and then you like put it on like a surface and then like make it look like a footprint, like a baby footprint.

346
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:02,260
Yeah.

347
00:18:02,260 --> 00:18:04,760
So somebody did that at this like campground.

348
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:05,760
Yeah, I don't know.

349
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:07,760
I don't know how to fucking explain it.

350
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:09,760
I saw him doing the thing on the wall.

351
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:14,260
Okay, I understand what you're saying, but to preface that with like, "You know when you..."

352
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:15,260
It's like, what?

353
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:16,760
I thought it was a normal thing.

354
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:17,260
No.

355
00:18:17,260 --> 00:18:20,260
Oh, well I guess... Alright, well somebody did that at this...

356
00:18:20,260 --> 00:18:21,260
Some guy did that.

357
00:18:21,260 --> 00:18:22,260
Some fucking freakazoid.

358
00:18:22,260 --> 00:18:24,760
Some guy framed a baby for walking on the wall.

359
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:25,260
Yeah.

360
00:18:25,260 --> 00:18:31,260
That's... Okay, so somebody like put like a fake baby footprint and then my mom told us that a baby got their head cut off

361
00:18:31,260 --> 00:18:47,180
and ran up the wall she told us it was like she was trying to like freak us out

362
00:18:47,180 --> 00:18:50,380
like she was trying to like tell us like it was like we're camping so she's trying

363
00:18:50,380 --> 00:18:54,700
to tell us a ghost story that's what she told us I didn't have the fucking like

364
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:58,780
the thought to be like that wouldn't work

365
00:18:58,780 --> 00:19:10,980
you were camping we were camping so where's the wall it was no wall no we

366
00:19:10,980 --> 00:19:14,520
were camping at a well I mean we were like camping but it was like just my my

367
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:17,880
uncle's like a veteran so he goes to like this VFW campground.

368
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:19,880
"My uncle's a veteran!"

369
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:21,880
"My uncle's a veteran!"

370
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:23,880
"He's a red eye!"

371
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:25,880
Was it like a cabin?

372
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:27,880
We didn't have a cabin.

373
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:29,880
So where was the wall?

374
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:31,880
There was like the showers.

375
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:33,880
They put baby footprints in the showers?

376
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:35,880
On the front door.

377
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:37,880
So my mom told me that a baby got its head cut off.

378
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:39,880
Sounds like Passover.

379
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:41,880
A baby got its head cut off.

380
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:43,880
My mom told me a baby got its head cut off.

381
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:49,080
She explained, she was like, you know how when a chicken gets its head cut off, the body can still run around?

382
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:50,840
Sure.

383
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:51,340
Yeah.

384
00:19:51,340 --> 00:19:51,840
Yeah.

385
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:52,840
I have heard that, yeah.

386
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:54,840
But a baby is far from a chicken.

387
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:56,840
I was fucking ten years old.

388
00:19:56,840 --> 00:19:57,840
I was ten years old.

389
00:19:57,840 --> 00:19:58,340
You were ten?

390
00:19:58,340 --> 00:20:00,340
I was ten. She told me that.

391
00:20:00,340 --> 00:20:02,340
She told me it, saying she was like,

392
00:20:02,340 --> 00:20:06,340
"This is the only time it has ever happened in existence."

393
00:20:06,340 --> 00:20:10,340
And I was like, "I have to believe you. You're my mom."

394
00:20:10,340 --> 00:20:12,340
A baby got its head cut off.

395
00:20:12,340 --> 00:20:15,940
He got his head cut off and ran up the wall.

396
00:20:15,940 --> 00:20:18,200
(laughter)

397
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:21,240
- So we were so freaked out,

398
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:23,320
we were so freaked out by that,

399
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:24,780
that we were like,

400
00:20:24,780 --> 00:20:25,880
well obviously we're gonna tell,

401
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:28,360
she was like, don't tell any of the younger kids.

402
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:32,160
Obviously we're gonna immediately tell the younger kids.

403
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:33,360
- 'Cause they're gonna try it.

404
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:34,200
- Yeah.

405
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:36,880
- Yeah, 'cause the younger kids are gonna try it.

406
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:38,160
- The kids are gonna cut their heads off.

407
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:39,320
- Can a baby run?

408
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:40,320
(laughter)

409
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:41,680
- That's the truth, that's the whole thing.

410
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:43,680
That's how he got her, dude.

411
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:45,680
She made sure...

412
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:47,680
Ma'am, I posit one question to you.

413
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:49,680
Can a baby run?

414
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:51,680
No, but a teen can.

415
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:53,680
It ran because its head fell off

416
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:55,680
and it lost all the weight of its head.

417
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:57,680
[laughter]

418
00:20:57,680 --> 00:20:59,680
It seems like she really

419
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:01,680
thought this out.

420
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:03,680
Well, of course, the baby's head

421
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:05,680
is what's keeping it from running.

422
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:07,680
Running up the wall, Neo style.

423
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:09,680
Matrix.

424
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:13,680
Once it loses its head, it's weightless enough it can just run up a wall like a bug.

425
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:16,680
No clip right through the fucking wall.

426
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:19,680
Also it was standing in paint when it got its head cut off.

427
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:23,680
No, the paint on the wall was red so she told us that was the baby's blood.

428
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:24,680
Oh my gosh.

429
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:25,680
And they never washed it off.

430
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:26,680
They never washed it off.

431
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:28,680
I think you have a bad mom.

432
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:32,680
She just wanted to scare us.

433
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:35,680
She didn't call me a lying piece of shit.

434
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:36,680
She did, yeah.

435
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:38,680
When she dropped me off.

436
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:43,720
scare me he would just wait around a corner and then go really loud

437
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:47,240
that wouldn't scare me he would like you would like to start he would hiss or

438
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:51,520
like yell he would startle me my mom would just show me a spoon she'd be

439
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:56,200
like you know what this means I'm gonna play spoons on your head she yeah my mom

440
00:21:56,200 --> 00:22:01,440
she broke four wooden spoons on my ass and then if you if you bring that up to

441
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:06,720
her she's like why do you why are you a liar I love that thing that parents do

442
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:09,900
were there just like nothing bad ever happened to you when you were a kid

443
00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:15,240
everything was swag oh yeah you you had this most cool childhood of all time we

444
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:19,500
went to Disney World even though we never did we did this new world it

445
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:24,640
wasn't the backyard no no that was Disney World yeah also a baby got its

446
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:28,900
head up the wall a couple things about your childhood the baby actually did get

447
00:22:28,900 --> 00:22:32,480
his head cut off but he did not run up the wall up the wall they painted the

448
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:37,160
footprints on later. And he scared your dad away. And he never came back because

449
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:43,920
that baby. So if you're gonna blame somebody, blame that baby. I feel like I've talked about this before on the podcast, but my mom also

450
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:50,240
scared me out of drinking blueberry pomegranate juice. No. She scared me out

451
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:54,200
of drinking more than one cup a day. It was, she did this as a precautionary

452
00:22:54,200 --> 00:23:00,200
measure because she wanted to keep her juice to herself. She was like, you can

453
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:04,240
I mean drink like half of a cup of this because you drink more than that.

454
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:05,840
There's so many antioxidants in it.

455
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:06,840
Your blood will be oxidized.

456
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:07,840
That's bullshit.

457
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:15,000
I don't remember saying it like it was like science.

458
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,000
That's fucked up.

459
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:23,960
My mom told me that spiders lived in bananas and like every third banana had a spider in

460
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:24,960
it.

461
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:26,840
So you wouldn't eat too many bananas.

462
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:29,160
I still can't eat the bottom of a banana.

463
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:32,840
my brain won't let me eat the bottom because my mom said that, you know, the little like

464
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:37,720
the little tip, the uncircumcised penis tip of a banana at the very bottom?

465
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:38,720
Yeah.

466
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:39,720
She was like, that's where the spiders live.

467
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:40,720
The clit.

468
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:41,720
Yeah, like banana clit.

469
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:42,720
The banana's clit.

470
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:43,720
Yeah.

471
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:45,160
So like still to this day, I throw away the last bite of a banana.

472
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:46,160
I can't eat it.

473
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:49,040
I mean, I know that it's not in there, but I kind of don't.

474
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:55,480
I don't drink juice as much as I did.

475
00:23:55,480 --> 00:24:00,160
It's funny to hear you talk about this Pat, because you do the exact same thing to your

476
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:01,160
nephews.

477
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:02,160
Oh yeah.

478
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:06,480
Every day you go up to your nephews and say, "Hey, you know if you put that Spider-Man

479
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:07,960
mask on it could pull your head off."

480
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:11,960
I mean it is the truth that like the only fun part of having kids is abusing them mentally.

481
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:12,960
You know what I mean?

482
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:13,960
Tricking them into playing mind games.

483
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:14,960
It's like the fucking mind games.

484
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:15,960
Yeah.

485
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:21,440
I remember one time my younger brother when he was like four, because he's like 15 years

486
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:28,880
younger than me or whatever, he spilled a glass of orange juice or

487
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:34,940
something. I was like, "Well, gotta call the police." And he was like, "No! Don't call the police!"

488
00:24:34,940 --> 00:24:40,660
I was like, "Listen, buddy. The deed is done. They're on their way." And then I had my

489
00:24:40,660 --> 00:24:47,040
other brother go outside and knock on the door. It's like, "It's the police! Open up!"

490
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:50,400
Now he's 10 and he brings it up all the time. Every time I see him, he's like,

491
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:53,980
Remember when you told me that the police were coming because I spilled the juice

492
00:24:53,980 --> 00:24:57,560
Shut up

493
00:24:57,560 --> 00:25:09,520
Yeah, I can't wait till like in like can't wait three or four years old in one year yeah, yeah

494
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:15,040
But my nephews are like old enough, and I'm look they're like oh yeah, you told me you're going to see spider-man in New York

495
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:20,080
Yeah, and you said you told me if you told me if you open the fridge after 10 p.m.

496
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:24,920
And or comes out and eats you. Oh, I told I told uh, I told one of them the other day

497
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:28,240
That if they open up the air fryer

498
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:32,280
If they touch the air fryer at all, the food will turn to ice while it's cooking

499
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:37,480
That's scary. Yeah, I thought a pressure cooker could blow my head off

500
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:40,200
Little did I know?

501
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:41,480
good

502
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:43,480
We have to give more.

503
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:45,480
We can say that we're getting beers.

504
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:47,480
You want to call my buddies?

505
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:49,480
We're trying to keep it from the listeners.

506
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:51,480
We're not drinking beer.

507
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:53,480
No.

508
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:55,480
The listeners would hate it if we drank beer.

509
00:25:55,480 --> 00:25:57,480
In New York it's illegal to drink beer and record a podcast.

510
00:25:57,480 --> 00:25:59,480
Back to drinking beer is pretty awesome.

511
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:01,480
Yeah.

512
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:03,480
Man, I fucking, beginning of the month

513
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:05,480
when you, I'm just gonna show you anyways.

514
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:07,480
Yeah, when your uncle died in 9/11.

515
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:09,480
Yeah, when my uncle died in 9/11

516
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:10,480
at the beginning of this month.

517
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:11,480
Yeah.

518
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:12,480
That was bad.

519
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:17,000
I drank, I bought, what's that?

520
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,480
Clown shoes space something IPA.

521
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:22,240
You just putting words together brother.

522
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:26,280
I mean that's what they do to make the IPAs.

523
00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:31,680
They take a dart board that just has every word that someone posted on Reddit in 2009

524
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:33,560
and they just throw a dart at it.

525
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:34,560
Bacon.

526
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:35,560
And then they hire the worst.

527
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:36,560
Bacon plucker Will Wheaton.

528
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:37,560
Yeah.

529
00:26:37,560 --> 00:26:38,560
Double IPA.

530
00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:54,320
They hire a guy who makes Calvin and Hobbes fan comics to draw the art for it.

531
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:56,360
And it's like a dinosaur in a spaceship.

532
00:26:56,360 --> 00:27:00,560
And you drink one and you pass out immediately.

533
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:02,640
You drink one and you don't have to eat for three days.

534
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:08,280
I drank four 9ABV Tallboys.

535
00:27:08,280 --> 00:27:09,120
- 39 ABV?

536
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:14,080
- I drank four of them in a row because I was bored.

537
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:15,600
- Dude, you got a fly in your house right now,

538
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:16,760
a little fly creature.

539
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:18,880
- I've had a couple of fruit flies recently.

540
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:19,800
- I've had a couple of fruit flies.

541
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:22,380
- They love fruit, so Cameron, watch out.

542
00:27:22,380 --> 00:27:24,520
- They love fruit?

543
00:27:24,520 --> 00:27:26,080
- I don't get it.

544
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:26,980
Could you explain?

545
00:27:26,980 --> 00:27:31,320
- You wear women's cologne.

546
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:33,040
- Cameron does wear women's deodorant.

547
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:35,080
- I straight up don't wear any cologne.

548
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:38,760
kind of gangster to admit that.

549
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:39,760
Cushby is Cologne.

550
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:40,760
Cushby is Cologne.

551
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:41,760
That's true dude.

552
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:42,760
Hey Patrick.

553
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:43,760
Who sings that?

554
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:44,760
Who's Cushby?

555
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:45,760
It's me.

556
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:46,760
Yeah?

557
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:47,760
Yeah.

558
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:48,760
Hey Patrick.

559
00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:49,760
Cushby my Cologne.

560
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:50,760
If you heard the most beautiful song in the world would you cry?

561
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:51,760
Yeah.

562
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:52,760
And you know what that song is?

563
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:53,760
It's Hero by Enrique Iglesias.

564
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:54,760
Hey Caleb.

565
00:27:54,760 --> 00:27:55,760
What's up?

566
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:57,560
If you heard the most beautiful song in the world would you cry?

567
00:27:57,560 --> 00:27:58,560
A hundred times.

568
00:27:58,560 --> 00:27:59,840
Would you cry if I broke your heart?

569
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:01,520
I would cry if you did anything to me.

570
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:02,520
Would you cry right now?

571
00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:03,520
I would cry.

572
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:07,960
If you saw me on the train and you saw me standing on the platform and I was waving goodbye,

573
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:08,960
would you cry?

574
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:09,960
If you saw me on the train crying?

575
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:13,120
Yo, if you saw me on the Hogwarts Express, would you cry?

576
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:16,620
Because you know you wasn't going to see me for a school year.

577
00:28:16,620 --> 00:28:20,360
What would you do if I went to boarding school right now?

578
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:22,740
Would you sign my paper to go to Hogsmeade?

579
00:28:22,740 --> 00:28:26,760
Would you cry if they made me go to Mars to colonize it and you never saw me again?

580
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:30,560
Are you guys going to go off planet when it happens?

581
00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:31,560
Yeah, dude.

582
00:28:31,560 --> 00:28:34,920
I'm gonna go to Neptune.

583
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:35,920
Wow.

584
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:36,920
I'm gonna go to the alien planet.

585
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:37,920
I have to decide.

586
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:38,920
You have to pick a planet right now.

587
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:39,920
That's a binding decision.

588
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:40,920
You have to pick a planet right now.

589
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:41,920
Yeah.

590
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:42,920
You have to pick a planet right now.

591
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:43,920
Which planet, Patrick?

592
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:45,160
I would do Mercury because then I could live to be like...

593
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:46,160
You're gonna die.

594
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:47,160
Alright, Caleb.

595
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:48,160
What's it?

596
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:49,160
Shut up.

597
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:50,160
Shut up.

598
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:51,160
You shut up.

599
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:52,160
You listen to me.

600
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:59,520
If we colonize Mercury, Mercury travels around the sun like I think 88 days is...

601
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:01,440
How many days, Patrick?

602
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:02,440
Wow.

603
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:08,280
I think it's 88, one year on Mercury is 88 days on Earth.

604
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:11,040
So I could live to be 300.

605
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:12,040
Wow.

606
00:29:12,040 --> 00:29:14,040
If I do it right.

607
00:29:14,040 --> 00:29:15,360
If you do it right.

608
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:17,800
And how is doing it right?

609
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:20,280
Maybe start doing a keto, do what my grandpa did.

610
00:29:20,280 --> 00:29:22,920
If you could do keto on Mercury you'd live forever.

611
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:23,920
No, a keto.

612
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:24,920
Oh.

613
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:25,920
A keto and keto.

614
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:26,920
Uh huh.

615
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:27,920
I'll go with keto.

616
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:28,920
Well, he went, my grandpa went completely vegan.

617
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:29,920
Wow.

618
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:32,420
I had to clean out his shit from my closet.

619
00:29:32,420 --> 00:29:35,420
I had to clean that shit out of his ass when he turned vegan.

620
00:29:35,420 --> 00:29:38,420
I had to clean out the shit out of his, like, closet.

621
00:29:38,420 --> 00:29:41,320
Do you have an avant-garde vegan cookbook?

622
00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:43,420
I have had that, but it's not my thing.

623
00:29:43,420 --> 00:29:45,820
[laughter]

624
00:29:45,820 --> 00:29:47,720
I saw that guy one time in Boston.

625
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:49,120
Yeah, he was filming his videos.

626
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:53,720
Well, I saw him and I was like, "Is, like, Drake around?

627
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:56,420
Is this, like, one of, like, Drake's friends?"

628
00:29:56,420 --> 00:29:58,020
One of Drake's, like, white dude friends?

629
00:29:58,020 --> 00:30:01,520
So he's like, "You're gonna be black from now on, and I'm gonna give you a black guy haircut."

630
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:03,180
Dude, he's so Welsh, too.

631
00:30:03,180 --> 00:30:04,180
Yeah.

632
00:30:04,180 --> 00:30:05,180
Yeah.

633
00:30:05,180 --> 00:30:06,180
I love making Welsh food.

634
00:30:06,180 --> 00:30:11,460
I do love, Drake has 50 guys in his crew, all white dudes with cuts in their hairline.

635
00:30:11,460 --> 00:30:12,460
Yeah, yeah, with the line.

636
00:30:12,460 --> 00:30:16,220
And he's like, "I'm gonna make sure that you never go bald.

637
00:30:16,220 --> 00:30:21,140
If you go bald, I just replace you with another white dude."

638
00:30:21,140 --> 00:30:28,820
But I found, I was cleaning out my grandpa's shit in his closet and I found the Chinese

639
00:30:28,820 --> 00:30:29,820
health chimes.

640
00:30:29,820 --> 00:30:30,820
Chimes you say?

641
00:30:30,820 --> 00:30:31,820
Oh yeah, yeah.

642
00:30:31,820 --> 00:30:35,100
There were two balls, like two silver balls.

643
00:30:35,100 --> 00:30:37,020
I think those might have been your grandpa's.

644
00:30:37,020 --> 00:30:39,900
There were two balls in my grandpa's.

645
00:30:39,900 --> 00:30:41,280
They got him silvered, dude.

646
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:42,280
They got his balls put in silver.

647
00:30:42,280 --> 00:30:43,280
Oh, he put his real balls.

648
00:30:43,280 --> 00:30:46,900
Honestly, that, I kind of want to have my penis.

649
00:30:46,900 --> 00:30:49,740
I kind of want to have my penis pickled like.

650
00:30:49,740 --> 00:30:50,740
Like kimchi.

651
00:30:50,740 --> 00:30:57,760
Oh, yeah, you know, yeah, cuz also like I want people makes it bigger like think about a well no cucumber

652
00:30:57,760 --> 00:31:03,720
I know yeah, it makes it much smaller. Well, and that's even more impressive how big his dick is and that fucking brine

653
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:11,080
Yeah, yeah, he's got like a Jerry feels the rest are got it. No rest. Putin was packing. That's being was hanging that thing

654
00:31:11,080 --> 00:31:16,980
Yeah, he was long dong and on the that's what Rasputin translates to in American

655
00:31:16,980 --> 00:31:18,980
Yeah, strong penis.

656
00:31:18,980 --> 00:31:20,980
Strongest penis on earth.

657
00:31:20,980 --> 00:31:22,980
Yeah, Putin means penis.

658
00:31:22,980 --> 00:31:26,980
If you think about that, in relation to our fearless leader Donald Trump,

659
00:31:26,980 --> 00:31:30,980
Some woman came into work today and was like,

660
00:31:30,980 --> 00:31:32,980
What the hell?

661
00:31:32,980 --> 00:31:34,980
Some woman came into work today and was like,

662
00:31:34,980 --> 00:31:40,980
Did you hear the news about our fearless leader?

663
00:31:40,980 --> 00:31:42,980
Fingers crossed, I'm sorry if you're a Republican.

664
00:31:42,980 --> 00:31:48,380
Republican that's like damn you had that rehearsed lady. You're buying like vodka. What are you come on now?

665
00:31:48,380 --> 00:31:51,520
Let me buy all the vodka in the store

666
00:31:51,520 --> 00:31:58,220
Fuck I bet she bought a flavored vodka. Yeah, I can't remember what she bought to be honest

667
00:31:58,220 --> 00:32:02,300
She bought a mojito. I think she might have bought gin actually now that I think about it. It's a man's drink

668
00:32:02,300 --> 00:32:04,840
That's even better New Amsterdam something cheap

669
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:08,080
Not New Amsterdam. My dad when my dad visited me in Boston

670
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:13,440
He bought like the largest thing of New Amsterdam gin that they had at the store

671
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:15,000
like when he first got there.

672
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,320
They just polished it off by the time he left.

673
00:32:17,320 --> 00:32:19,840
Every night, just down in gin and tonics.

674
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:24,380
Oh, dude, a fucked up order we got today on the delivery thing.

675
00:32:24,380 --> 00:32:28,680
Somebody ordered a liter of Diet Pepsi and a liter and a half of Fireball.

676
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:29,680
Ugh, oh, fuck.

677
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:30,680
Were they 10 years old?

678
00:32:30,680 --> 00:32:31,680
Right.

679
00:32:31,680 --> 00:32:32,680

898
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:20,700

00:43:29,680 --> 00:43:32,760
the homophobic at any point now

it's about his girl partying all the time

903
00:43:39,880 --> 00:43:42,960
but i think it is a answer

904
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:44,780
i'm leaving it on

905
00:43:44,780 --> 00:43:46,180

907
00:43:48,780 --> 00:43:50,480
little bit or anything

908
00:43:50,480 --> 00:43:51,320

00:44:05,560 --> 00:44:10,540
You pick me up like Eddie Murphy did that if you drop me off and I asked you to come upstairs, would you?

914
00:44:10,540 --> 00:44:20,040
Yeah, yeah you would I'll try and get a nut off man, that's right. Hey, I'm trying to get nut off we should fuck this weekend

915
00:44:20,040 --> 00:44:33,600
That would be so funny, so this is just the plot of the movie. Imagine just posting a video to Twitter

916
00:44:33,600 --> 00:44:35,860
(laughing)

917
00:44:35,860 --> 00:44:38,200
- Hey guys, we're gonna fuck.

918
00:44:38,200 --> 00:44:42,680
- We didn't even put it on the Patreon.

919
00:44:42,680 --> 00:44:43,520
- Yeah, just on Twitter.

920
00:44:43,520 --> 00:44:45,160
- We're just gonna fuck each other.

921
00:44:45,160 --> 00:44:47,760
We're just gonna fuck each other raw in my apartment.

922
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:48,760
- Eddie Murphy style.

923
00:44:48,760 --> 00:44:51,500
- Yeah, wife in the next room, door locked.

924
00:44:51,500 --> 00:44:52,340
- Mm-hmm.

925
00:44:52,340 --> 00:44:55,360
- I got a door, I got a door to the bedroom,

926
00:44:55,360 --> 00:44:56,520
locked in the outside.

927
00:44:56,520 --> 00:44:58,160
Put the wife in the refrigerator.

928
00:44:58,160 --> 00:45:00,480
I don't give a fuck if you're cold, bitch, bring a towel.

929
00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:02,880
(laughing)

930
00:45:02,880 --> 00:45:10,400
towel. I don't know. Oh boy. I guess we should mention Caleb left the oven on all day. Oh

931
00:45:10,400 --> 00:45:18,640
yeah. That's why we've been in a gas leak. We're sitting in a gas chamber. Let's cut

932
00:45:18,640 --> 00:45:23,520
that out. I'm not cutting that out. Why would you cut that out dude? I'm not cutting that

933
00:45:23,520 --> 00:45:27,920
out because I want to. Those holocaust survivors are going to be so mad at you. All of our

934
00:45:27,920 --> 00:45:29,920
Holocaust survivors will listen to this.

935
00:45:29,920 --> 00:45:31,920
Oh my god, they're gonna be pissed off, dude.

936
00:45:31,920 --> 00:45:33,920
"Hey Patrick said what?"

937
00:45:33,920 --> 00:45:35,920
Don't do the voice.

938
00:45:35,920 --> 00:45:37,920
That's not even what they sounded like.

939
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:39,920
We should join the voice. We should audition.

940
00:45:39,920 --> 00:45:41,920
For the voice? You know Neil auditioned for the voice?

941
00:45:41,920 --> 00:45:43,920
What? No!

942
00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:45,920
Oh, maybe I shouldn't say that.

943
00:45:45,920 --> 00:45:49,920
It's okay, it's okay.

944
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:52,920
I just wanna say from here on out, for the last 15 minutes of the episode,

945
00:45:52,920 --> 00:45:54,920
I'm not gonna edit anything out

946
00:45:54,920 --> 00:45:56,920
because I don't want to.

947
00:45:56,920 --> 00:46:00,440
I don't feel like editing anything tonight.

948
00:46:00,440 --> 00:46:03,400
Well, I didn't say anything bad before.

949
00:46:03,400 --> 00:46:06,520
Just keep that in mind with whatever you say going forward.

950
00:46:06,520 --> 00:46:09,320
Now do your famous accent, Caleb.

951
00:46:09,320 --> 00:46:11,880
Yeah, Chinese Mr. Bean.

952
00:46:11,880 --> 00:46:15,080
Hello, I'm Mr. Bean.

953
00:46:15,080 --> 00:46:18,600
Nah, I'm kidding. Chinese people don't say "wa."

954
00:46:18,600 --> 00:46:19,800
What am I even saying?

955
00:46:19,800 --> 00:46:21,960
That's the Mr. Bean part, you don't understand.

956
00:46:21,960 --> 00:46:23,000
You don't understand, he's Mr. Bean.

957
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:24,600
That's the Mr. Bean part.

958
00:46:24,600 --> 00:46:27,720
The only difference- Mr. Bean transcends race and culture, okay?

959
00:46:27,720 --> 00:46:30,200
He does, that's why there's so many different- He's Mr. Bean no matter where he is.

960
00:46:30,200 --> 00:46:33,560
Listen, you can't hear the difference in the impression, okay?

961
00:46:33,560 --> 00:46:39,240
But if you could see me right now, you would be able to tell the Chinese part of Mr. Bean.

962
00:46:39,240 --> 00:46:42,040
You would be ripping some tape off my eyes.

963
00:46:42,040 --> 00:46:43,880
God damn it, dude.

964
00:46:43,880 --> 00:46:45,880
No.

965
00:46:45,880 --> 00:46:46,360
No.

966
00:46:46,360 --> 00:46:47,080
No!

967
00:46:47,080 --> 00:46:48,920
We don't even have any tape!

968
00:46:48,920 --> 00:46:50,120
Caleb doesn't have eyes.

969
00:46:50,120 --> 00:46:52,120
Nah, I'm kidding.

970
00:46:52,920 --> 00:46:54,920
Oh man, imagine him...

971
00:46:54,920 --> 00:46:56,920
I don't have eyes!

972
00:46:56,920 --> 00:46:58,920
Smooth head and no eyes.

973
00:46:58,920 --> 00:47:00,920
Oh my god, dude.

974
00:47:00,920 --> 00:47:02,920
I would love to be an eyepatch guy.

975
00:47:02,920 --> 00:47:04,920
Yeah? You wanna go Dan Crenshaw mode?

976
00:47:04,920 --> 00:47:06,920
No, I wanna go like Slick Rick.

977
00:47:06,920 --> 00:47:08,920
Oh, okay.

978
00:47:08,920 --> 00:47:10,920
You wanna be one of the most fire MCs of all time.

979
00:47:10,920 --> 00:47:12,920
I mean, I basically wanna spit

980
00:47:12,920 --> 00:47:14,920
more than anything, so if the eyepatch

981
00:47:14,920 --> 00:47:16,920
helps, I guess I'll do that.

982
00:47:16,920 --> 00:47:18,920
I also memorized all the lyrics

983
00:47:18,920 --> 00:47:20,920
to Children's Story when I was 13.

984
00:47:20,920 --> 00:47:26,400
Nice, I've I didn't realize how much I drank. You realize how much you drank?

985
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:29,480
Yeah, I talked about losing my virginity on here. I don't talk about

986
00:47:29,480 --> 00:47:35,320
We have a really nasty lately someone said

987
00:47:35,320 --> 00:47:44,120
Apologize a Kimster 61 on Apple podcast app. Sorry for talking about fingering dogs and fucking so

988
00:47:44,800 --> 00:47:50,720
It's funny, yeah. I literally didn't even think, like, when you tell a story about a child putting

989
00:47:50,720 --> 00:47:55,760
a fist up a dog's ass, it doesn't register in my head like, "Oh, that's disgusting."

990
00:47:55,760 --> 00:47:57,840
It registers in my head like, "Oh, that's very funny."

991
00:47:57,840 --> 00:48:02,240
Yeah, I mean, it is more funny than anything. I mean, just like imagine coming home and being

992
00:48:02,240 --> 00:48:03,680
like, "What do you think?"

993
00:48:03,680 --> 00:48:04,880
"Ah, shit, we gotta put the dog down."

994
00:48:04,880 --> 00:48:06,160
"Which one do you get rid of?"

995
00:48:06,160 --> 00:48:08,240
Yeah, that's true.

996
00:48:08,240 --> 00:48:09,280
You know, you send a kid to a job...

997
00:48:09,280 --> 00:48:12,000
It is fucked up that the dog got punished for that.

998
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:12,640
Yeah.

999
00:48:12,640 --> 00:48:14,840
It's the kid who tried to fuck the dog.

1000
00:48:14,840 --> 00:48:16,640
I wasn't even trying to fuck him.

1001
00:48:16,640 --> 00:48:17,740
He was trying to fuck the dog.

1002
00:48:17,740 --> 00:48:21,040
I would put my kid first up exploring my kid in veterinary

1003
00:48:21,040 --> 00:48:24,140
school and I claim that my dog's gay.

1004
00:48:24,140 --> 00:48:30,540
I mean, they're all two birds one bone two birds one fist in

1005
00:48:30,540 --> 00:48:31,540
the dog's ass.

1006
00:48:31,540 --> 00:48:33,240
I don't know that it was a fist.

1007
00:48:33,240 --> 00:48:36,540
It could have been you know, how like the monkey video and

1008
00:48:36,540 --> 00:48:39,240
porn they always say monkey video do that's one of my

1009
00:48:39,240 --> 00:48:41,440
favorite one loves to claim fisting.

1010
00:48:41,740 --> 00:48:46,620
There's no fist, dude. Come on. You're making a temple with your fingers.

1011
00:48:46,620 --> 00:48:47,120
Yeah.

1012
00:48:47,120 --> 00:48:47,620
Come on, man.

1013
00:48:47,620 --> 00:48:49,420
You can't punch into a man.

1014
00:48:49,420 --> 00:48:53,020
We were just complaining. We were just talking about how people were complaining about us getting nasty,

1015
00:48:53,020 --> 00:48:54,620
and now you're talking about the temple.

1016
00:48:54,620 --> 00:48:57,500
It's not a... Okay. Temple's the wrong word.

1017
00:48:57,500 --> 00:49:00,300
It's a point. You're making a point.

1018
00:49:00,300 --> 00:49:03,020
You make a teardrop shape with your hand.

1019
00:49:03,020 --> 00:49:03,520
It's like a...

1020
00:49:03,520 --> 00:49:05,580
You reach in there. You form a fist in there.

1021
00:49:05,580 --> 00:49:06,080
Oh.

1022
00:49:06,080 --> 00:49:08,300
You pull it out. Your hand's full of poop.

1023
00:49:08,300 --> 00:49:09,900
That's true. That's a good point.

1024
00:49:10,460 --> 00:49:13,300
It's yeah, I mean it's like Tony Soprano getting mad.

1025
00:49:13,300 --> 00:49:14,860
It's that. It's that hand.

1026
00:49:14,860 --> 00:49:20,180
It's not disgusting because some people medically need that to remove poop from their ass, okay?

1027
00:49:20,180 --> 00:49:21,580
Some people do.

1028
00:49:21,580 --> 00:49:22,340
Some people need that.

1029
00:49:22,340 --> 00:49:25,540
And if you're calling that disgusting, that's ableist.

1030
00:49:25,540 --> 00:49:27,860
If you had C. diff, would you drink a poop milkshake?

1031
00:49:27,860 --> 00:49:28,620
If I had what?

1032
00:49:28,620 --> 00:49:29,620
What's C. diff?

1033
00:49:29,620 --> 00:49:31,500
C. diff, it's what Tig Notaro had.

1034
00:49:31,500 --> 00:49:32,740
I think that's what you had.

1035
00:49:32,740 --> 00:49:33,060
Yeah.

1036
00:49:33,060 --> 00:49:33,860
Excuse me?

1037
00:49:33,860 --> 00:49:36,500
Well, once you tweet from her account, you get it.

1038
00:49:36,500 --> 00:49:40,380
I tried to donate poop to the C. diff thing, yeah.

1039
00:49:40,380 --> 00:49:43,300
- Is that like a fecal transplant thing?

1040
00:49:43,300 --> 00:49:44,140
- Yeah.

1041
00:49:44,140 --> 00:49:44,960
- But you know how it works?

1042
00:49:44,960 --> 00:49:47,560
They don't like cut you open and put new poop in you.

1043
00:49:47,560 --> 00:49:49,360
You have to drink a poop smoothie.

1044
00:49:49,360 --> 00:49:50,200
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1045
00:49:50,200 --> 00:49:51,020
- What?

1046
00:49:51,020 --> 00:49:51,860
- I swear to God, dude.

1047
00:49:51,860 --> 00:49:52,700
- You didn't know that?

1048
00:49:52,700 --> 00:49:55,640
- You have to drink a man's, it has to be a man.

1049
00:49:55,640 --> 00:49:57,520
(laughing)

1050
00:49:57,520 --> 00:50:00,820
You have to drink a man's poop smoothie.

1051
00:50:00,820 --> 00:50:01,760
- Ugh.

1052
00:50:01,760 --> 00:50:03,500
- Yeah, you're telling me, dude.

1053
00:50:03,500 --> 00:50:04,340
- Oh, oh, oh.

1054
00:50:04,340 --> 00:50:05,180
- Yucky.

1055
00:50:05,180 --> 00:50:07,220
- I thought about giving poop,

1056
00:50:07,220 --> 00:50:09,980
or I tried to give poop and they said that I had bad poop.

1057
00:50:09,980 --> 00:50:13,180
Yeah, no you have to have perfect poop to get into the smoothie.

1058
00:50:13,180 --> 00:50:15,180
My poop is insanely bad.

1059
00:50:15,180 --> 00:50:15,680
Yeah.

1060
00:50:15,680 --> 00:50:16,680
Okay, we're getting nasty.

1061
00:50:16,680 --> 00:50:17,180
Yeah.

1062
00:50:17,180 --> 00:50:17,680
Sorry.

1063
00:50:17,680 --> 00:50:21,180
We have already been talking about fucking drinking poop smoothies.

1064
00:50:21,180 --> 00:50:23,180
What can we talk about that's not nasty?

1065
00:50:23,180 --> 00:50:23,680
Okay.

1066
00:50:23,680 --> 00:50:26,680
Yeah, I mean, yeah, people have to drink those sometimes because they like the taste.

1067
00:50:26,680 --> 00:50:27,680
What can we talk about that's not gross?

1068
00:50:27,680 --> 00:50:28,680
I don't know.

1069
00:50:28,680 --> 00:50:32,180
Let's go back to the whatever how many fucking episodes we've done of this show.

1070
00:50:32,180 --> 00:50:35,680
Think about the not least nasty thing we've talked about.

1071
00:50:35,680 --> 00:50:37,180
We've always been nasty.

1072
00:50:37,180 --> 00:50:38,180
We aren't good.

1073
00:50:38,180 --> 00:50:42,220
were okay we are we are getting more nasty but that's just because because

1074
00:50:42,220 --> 00:50:46,320
we're so excited to see each other first times are a change I'll say that this is

1075
00:50:46,320 --> 00:50:50,780
a nasty era Donald Trump is in the hospital for having bad poop okay this is

1076
00:50:50,780 --> 00:50:54,440
a thing that we ate some black that's gonna have some died on the toilet yeah

1077
00:50:54,440 --> 00:51:02,820
yeah he Elvis Elvis dude it was funny if Trump survives COVID and walks out of

1078
00:51:02,820 --> 00:51:07,060
the hospital and gets like hit by a bus but it's like the end of a movie

1079
00:51:07,060 --> 00:51:09,060

1080
00:51:09,060 --> 00:51:11,060
Yeah.

00:51:11,060 --> 00:51:13,060
It's just like, ah man.

1082
00:51:13,060 --> 00:51:15,060
And while, before he goes out and gets hit by all the cars,

1083
00:51:15,060 --> 00:51:17,060
he also does the other scene.

1084
00:51:17,060 --> 00:51:19,060
The president getting hit by a bus.

1085
00:51:19,060 --> 00:51:21,060
He also does.

1086
00:51:21,060 --> 00:51:23,060
President Trump today died when he was hit by a bus.

1087
00:51:23,060 --> 00:51:25,060
He does that scene

1088
00:51:25,060 --> 00:51:27,060
from Meet Joe Black. Yeah.

1089
00:51:27,060 --> 00:51:29,060
And then he does the other scene from Meet Joe Black

1090
00:51:29,060 --> 00:51:31,060
before, the second before he

1091
00:51:31,060 --> 00:51:33,060
leaves the hospital. Or like it's the end of

1092
00:51:33,060 --> 00:51:35,060
Drag Me to Hell. Yeah.

1093
00:51:35,060 --> 00:51:39,060
He just gets pulled to hell at the train station.

1094
00:51:39,060 --> 00:51:40,060
Yeah, there's a talking goat.

1095
00:51:40,060 --> 00:51:41,060
Nah, I'm just kidding.

1096

He's going to heaven.

1097
00:51:42,060 --> 00:51:43,060
He's going to heaven.

1098
00:51:43,060 --> 00:51:44,060

He's beautiful.

They put beautiful people in heaven.

1103
00:51:48,060 --> 00:51:49,060
They put ugly people in hell.

1104
00:51:49,060 --> 00:51:50,060
I want to fuck him.

1105
00:51:50,060 --> 00:51:51,060

Yeah.

1107
00:51:52,060 --> 00:51:53,060
Everybody's so mad at Donald Trump.

1108
00:51:53,060 --> 00:51:54,060
Does he just want to fuck him?

1109
00:51:54,060 --> 00:51:55,620
Rachel Maddow's mad because he's turning him straight.

1110
00:51:55,620 --> 00:51:56,620
Oh, what?

1111
00:51:56,620 --> 00:51:57,620

00:51:59,620 --> 00:52:00,620
So transparent.

1115
00:52:00,620 --> 00:52:03,500
That's a beautiful guy.

1116
00:52:03,500 --> 00:52:09,700
I love Lin-Manuel. I love Lin-Manuel. What if you, okay, imagine craziest threesome of all

1117
00:52:09,700 --> 00:52:15,660

1118
00:52:15,660 --> 00:52:22,660

00:52:31,660 --> 00:52:34,260
Uh, like a normal poop.

1123
00:52:34,260 --> 00:52:37,760
It's a normal kind of a normal emoji poop.

1124
00:52:37,760 --> 00:52:39,660
You know, that's kind of gross.

1125
00:52:39,660 --> 00:52:41,060
Yeah, fake poop.

1126
00:52:41,060 --> 00:52:42,460
Fake poop.

1127
00:52:42,460 --> 00:52:43,560
You buy it five below.

1128
00:52:43,560 --> 00:52:45,460
Yeah, fake poop.

1129
00:52:45,460 --> 00:52:48,060
Where you soak a toilet paper roll in water.

1130
00:52:48,060 --> 00:52:52,860
I can think of is you're probably be having sex in a toilet getting

1131
00:52:52,860 --> 00:52:54,760
pranked by a stick of gum.

1132
00:52:54,760 --> 00:52:59,460
I remember I may have talked about this before.

1133
00:52:59,460 --> 00:53:01,960
a stick of gum that zaps you.

1134
00:53:01,960 --> 00:53:04,820
- I remember my mom, no I've talked about this before.

1135
00:53:04,820 --> 00:53:06,260
My mom was like--

1136
00:53:06,260 --> 00:53:08,540
- We're at a point where we're like,

1137
00:53:08,540 --> 00:53:09,380
all the best stories have been said.

1138
00:53:09,380 --> 00:53:10,400
- We've run out of stuff, dude.

1139
00:53:10,400 --> 00:53:12,560
- Can somebody do something horrible to me?

1140
00:53:12,560 --> 00:53:15,120
Just so I have something to talk about.

1141
00:53:15,120 --> 00:53:15,960
I don't care what it is.

1142
00:53:15,960 --> 00:53:18,900
- It's hard to do it now with COVID and everything.

1143
00:53:18,900 --> 00:53:21,360
You can't go out and experience shit.

1144
00:53:21,360 --> 00:53:22,620
- Trying to think what's happened recently.

1145
00:53:22,620 --> 00:53:25,580
- Well no, I have the story job now.

1146
00:53:25,580 --> 00:53:26,420
- Yeah, you do.

1147
00:53:26,420 --> 00:53:27,240
- Now I'm gonna be the one with the stories.

1148
00:53:27,240 --> 00:53:28,460
- I need to get a job for stories.

1149
00:53:28,460 --> 00:53:32,980
I have zero stories but I tell the most.

1150
00:53:32,980 --> 00:53:39,880
I didn't tell it on the pod but a guy came in and he was talking about the tech bubble

1151
00:53:39,880 --> 00:53:44,620
to me and I was like oh I know the tech bubble and I was just like talking to him about that

1152
00:53:44,620 --> 00:53:47,900
and he just started talking about like the future and shit and he's like does that know

1153
00:53:47,900 --> 00:53:51,500
where he started going yeah and in fucking five years we're all gonna have heads this

1154
00:53:51,500 --> 00:53:55,380
big and tiny bodies we're gonna use mind control and teleport everywhere.

1155
00:53:55,380 --> 00:54:00,180
Just so you know, listener, Cameron just mimed a yard long head.

1156
00:54:00,180 --> 00:54:03,220
How big is a yard?

1157
00:54:03,220 --> 00:54:05,380
It's three feet.

1158
00:54:05,380 --> 00:54:06,740
Somebody hates football in America.

1159
00:54:06,740 --> 00:54:07,740
I do.

1160
00:54:07,740 --> 00:54:08,740
Yeah.

1161
00:54:08,740 --> 00:54:09,740
And somebody never went to first grade.

1162
00:54:09,740 --> 00:54:10,740
Yeah.

1163
00:54:10,740 --> 00:54:15,540
And he came in, he came in, I thought a yard was metric for like a really long time.

1164
00:54:15,540 --> 00:54:16,540
He did, yeah.

1165
00:54:16,540 --> 00:54:17,540
He talked to me.

1166
00:54:17,540 --> 00:54:20,820
I did tilt just now.

1167
00:54:20,820 --> 00:54:23,900
He talked to me for fucking like 10 minutes.

1168
00:54:23,900 --> 00:54:25,700
This big.

1169
00:54:25,700 --> 00:54:29,100
I never, I only think of things in like feet and inches.

1170
00:54:29,100 --> 00:54:29,940
Yeah.

1171
00:54:29,940 --> 00:54:30,900
Actually no, 'cause millimeters,

1172
00:54:30,900 --> 00:54:33,460
like if you, like skateboard wheels are all in millimeters.

1173
00:54:33,460 --> 00:54:35,860
I think a millimeter is how big a millipede is.

1174
00:54:35,860 --> 00:54:36,860
Yeah.

1175
00:54:36,860 --> 00:54:38,220
I don't know how big a millimeter is,

1176
00:54:38,220 --> 00:54:39,140
I just know there's a difference between--

1177
00:54:39,140 --> 00:54:40,940
A millimeter is a million meters.

1178
00:54:40,940 --> 00:54:44,820
50 millimeters and 60 millimeters, big difference.

1179
00:54:44,820 --> 00:54:45,740
That's true.

1180
00:54:45,740 --> 00:54:46,560
Yeah.

1181
00:54:46,560 --> 00:54:47,400
Yeah.

1182
00:54:47,400 --> 00:54:49,420
I know that.

1183
00:54:49,420 --> 00:54:54,740
else about metric. Yeah let's get let's do some math and measurement content right

1184
00:54:54,740 --> 00:55:01,140
now. You want me to do math? Let's do okay Patrick what is 5 times 3? 5 times 3 is

1185
00:55:01,140 --> 00:55:08,740
15. Okay what's... You did this thing where you delay by saying the problem back to you. 5 times 3 well I know that I

1186
00:55:08,740 --> 00:55:15,220
definitely know that one. It's 15. Okay give me another one. What's 15 times 5? Fuck off.

1187
00:55:15,220 --> 00:55:19,220
15 times 5, okay? That's easy. Come on.

1188
00:55:19,220 --> 00:55:20,220
Shut up.

1189
00:55:20,220 --> 00:55:21,220
15 times 5.

1190
00:55:21,220 --> 00:55:22,220
Uh-uh.

1191
00:55:22,220 --> 00:55:25,220
This is literally Beetlejuice on our story.

1192
00:55:25,220 --> 00:55:26,220
We're just doing that, dude.

1193
00:55:26,220 --> 00:55:28,220
Alright, what's 100 plus 100?

1194
00:55:28,220 --> 00:55:30,220
100 plus 100 is 200.

1195
00:55:30,220 --> 00:55:40,220
7 times 7 is 49.

1196
00:55:40,220 --> 00:55:42,220
Okay, I didn't ask you that one, so it doesn't count.

1197
00:55:42,220 --> 00:55:43,220
You just lost points.

1198
00:55:43,220 --> 00:55:44,220
Ah, shit.

1199
00:55:44,220 --> 00:55:48,380
All right, what's 7 times 8? 7 times 8 is 56 because 5 6 7 8

1200
00:55:48,380 --> 00:55:51,260

1201
00:55:51,260 --> 00:55:53,260
56 5 6

1202
00:55:53,260 --> 00:55:58,080
7 8. All right. What's 13 times 13? 13 times 13 is 111

1203
00:55:58,080 --> 00:56:00,140
No

1204
00:56:00,140 --> 00:56:03,260
What? No, no, no, that's 11 times 11. That can't be true.

1205
00:56:03,260 --> 00:56:06,460
144 okay, so it's okay. All right, let's do it.

1206
00:56:06,460 --> 00:56:11,420
144 so the one after that. I wish I could cut your brain open and see what's happening right now.

1207
00:56:11,820 --> 00:56:19,020
Which go going here teen times is that 156? No, he's having a push out. It's 169

1208
00:56:19,020 --> 00:56:31,420
You guys I fuck I have dyscalculia you can't do

1209
00:56:31,420 --> 00:56:37,100
Math shit at me. I only better has time Patrick has dysmorphia. So we can't do math

1210
00:56:38,380 --> 00:56:44,440
It's true, and this is a message to all the fans out there. We're allowed to make fun of Patrick for this you're not that's right

1211
00:56:44,440 --> 00:56:46,700
You're not best friends with him. You leave him alone

1212
00:56:46,700 --> 00:56:51,120
Yeah, you stop going in the discord and you stop saying things like I wish Patrick would get hit by a bus I

1213
00:56:51,120 --> 00:56:57,020
Don't you're making me sound like a bitch wrong. Yeah, actually do it. I can't

1214
00:56:57,020 --> 00:57:03,140
Try to kill me try to kill me you can't you can't find me. Yeah, I can't even get to his heart

1215
00:57:03,140 --> 00:57:05,700
It's very easy to find Patrick. It's no

1216
00:57:06,620 --> 00:57:10,620
Here's a new challenge. Find Patrick and break his heart.

1217
00:57:10,620 --> 00:57:14,620
I dare you. Find Patrick and make him cry.

1218
00:57:14,620 --> 00:57:18,620
Whichever person does that first

1219
00:57:18,620 --> 00:57:22,620
gets a guess on an episode.

1220
00:57:22,620 --> 00:57:26,620
Whoever finds Patrick and breaks his heart

1221
00:57:26,620 --> 00:57:30,620
to pieces, they get to come on the podcast.

1222
00:57:30,620 --> 00:57:34,620
It has to be to pieces. It won't happen. He has to be in shambles.

1223
00:57:34,620 --> 00:57:35,620
That's a long time.

1224
00:57:35,620 --> 00:57:37,500
It doesn't matter if you're

1225
00:57:37,500 --> 00:57:38,980
breaking my heart.

1226
00:57:38,980 --> 00:57:40,500
I'll do it right now.

1227
00:57:40,500 --> 00:57:41,780
OK, I love you.

1228
00:57:41,780 --> 00:57:42,820
Not.

1229
00:57:42,820 --> 00:57:44,900
What?

1230
00:57:44,900 --> 00:57:47,220
You heard me, you heard me.

1231
00:57:47,220 --> 00:57:49,200
Are you serious?

1232
00:57:49,200 --> 00:57:51,480
Chambles, guess who gets a guest

1233
00:57:51,480 --> 00:57:52,580
on the next episode?

1234
00:57:52,580 --> 00:57:55,540
Me.

1235
00:57:55,540 --> 00:57:56,640
Hey, Patrick.

1236
00:57:56,640 --> 00:57:57,500
What?

1237
00:57:57,500 --> 00:57:58,720
Would it break your heart if I

1238
00:57:58,720 --> 00:57:59,820
played your favorite song?

1239
00:58:04,060 --> 00:58:04,900
That's fucking--

1240
00:58:04,900 --> 00:58:05,740
- I can't stop.

1241
00:58:05,740 --> 00:58:07,460
- That's up to the first one,

1242
00:58:07,460 --> 00:58:10,460
would you cry, what would you do if I cried right now?

1243
00:58:10,460 --> 00:58:11,300
(laughing)

1244
00:58:11,300 --> 00:58:14,980
- Asking your manager what would you do if I cried at work.

1245
00:58:14,980 --> 00:58:15,820
(laughing)

1246
00:58:15,820 --> 00:58:17,100
My manager that.

1247
00:58:17,100 --> 00:58:18,580
- What would you do if I cried at work?

1248
00:58:18,580 --> 00:58:20,020
- That was how I was entertaining myself

1249
00:58:20,020 --> 00:58:21,020
for just like an hour.

1250
00:58:21,020 --> 00:58:22,500
Like there was just a point where I was just like

1251
00:58:22,500 --> 00:58:24,220
walking up and down the aisles where I just like have to--

1252
00:58:24,220 --> 00:58:25,200
- When you have like stupid jobs like that,

1253
00:58:25,200 --> 00:58:26,040
you have to entertain yourself.

1254
00:58:26,040 --> 00:58:26,860
- Yeah, it's just like retailers.

1255
00:58:26,860 --> 00:58:27,700
It's just like, yeah.

1256
00:58:27,700 --> 00:58:28,540
(laughing)

1257
00:58:28,540 --> 00:58:29,940
I just imagine going up to my manager and be like,

1258
00:58:29,940 --> 00:58:31,620
what would you do if I started crying?

1259
00:58:31,620 --> 00:58:33,460
And I did ask him and he started laughing

1260
00:58:33,460 --> 00:58:35,340
And then he said, "I would tell you to toughen up."

1261
00:58:35,340 --> 00:58:36,740
Which is, I think, a fair answer.

1262
00:58:36,740 --> 00:58:37,980
- That's beast, honestly.

1263
00:58:37,980 --> 00:58:38,820
- Yeah.

1264
00:58:38,820 --> 00:58:39,900
- Fucking bird clock, dude.

1265
00:58:39,900 --> 00:58:41,500
- I hate that bird clock warning.

1266
00:58:41,500 --> 00:58:42,500
- Can we break it?

1267
00:58:42,500 --> 00:58:45,900
- We got a minute and a half left, dude.

1268
00:58:45,900 --> 00:58:48,760
- I think, yeah, the funniest version of that

1269
00:58:48,760 --> 00:58:50,300
is like in a boardroom.

1270
00:58:50,300 --> 00:58:52,140
- Yeah, great meeting.

1271
00:58:52,140 --> 00:58:54,100
- Just real quick, one last thing before we leave.

1272
00:58:54,100 --> 00:58:56,860
What would you guys do if I just started crying?

1273
00:58:56,860 --> 00:58:58,140
Just right now in the boardroom.

1274
00:58:58,140 --> 00:58:58,980
- Yeah, so I'm just gonna--

1275
00:58:58,980 --> 00:59:00,580
- Would anybody else start crying?

1276
00:59:01,580 --> 00:59:08,620
just gonna give you a warning but right now I just want to know what would you do

1277
00:59:08,620 --> 00:59:13,260
if I cried right now just so you know I was thinking about crying the context

1278
00:59:13,260 --> 00:59:18,380
that I asked my manager was I asked if I could take my lunch break and she said

1279
00:59:18,380 --> 00:59:22,280
no like jokingly he was like no and I was like yeah and what would you do if I

1280
00:59:22,280 --> 00:59:25,700
just burst into tears right now

1281
00:59:26,420 --> 00:59:32,300
I it's better just no yeah no no context is a lot of straight-up manager what do

1282
00:59:32,300 --> 00:59:39,540

1283
00:59:39,540 --> 00:59:44,000

1284
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:48,260

1285
00:59:48,260 --> 00:59:53,020
cried in the morning or at the end of my shift if I cry at 3:30 would you be mad

1286
00:59:53,020 --> 00:59:58,900
if I picked you up from school and I was crying would you assume the worst?

1287
00:59:58,900 --> 01:00:00,700
Did you just pop a tooth out of your mouth?

1288
01:00:00,700 --> 01:00:08,100
no I have a really big cavity. Let me see it. You can't just put your finger over it.

1289
01:00:08,100 --> 01:00:14,820
Oh I can actually oh my god. My filling fell out and I haven't gotten it replaced. Did you swallow it?

1290
01:00:14,820 --> 01:00:20,500
No I spit it out thankfully but. Did it taste good? I feel like I have an iron

1291
01:00:20,500 --> 01:00:29,380
deficiency so it did taste good. Was it gold? I had a silver filling. My dentist Robert Christ.

1292
01:00:29,380 --> 01:00:35,460
There's no way. That was his name. I've talked about this before. We've talked about Robert Christ.

1293
01:00:35,460 --> 01:00:41,620
My dentist growing up was Sandra Miles, S Miles. What was your dentist name? Dr. Haruyama.

1294
01:00:41,620 --> 01:00:47,220
Haruyama? Isn't that a Pokemon? Like the fucking end of a Captain Underpants book?

1295
01:00:48,900 --> 01:00:54,260
Harry I was a pokey no hiriyama not harium. Okay, come on. Shut your mouth

1296
01:00:54,260 --> 01:01:00,780
Patrick thinks all Japanese stuff is the same. No, I don't he literally just said it you literally like that did I?

1297
01:01:00,780 --> 01:01:04,100
Just wrote it down on the table. You're gonna have to wipe that off, dude

1298
01:01:04,100 --> 01:01:07,980
I don't know why you wrote it on the table great now. You're dropping the fucking marker. Come on. That's

1299
01:01:07,980 --> 01:01:16,060
My jewel yeah, you're for people listening. Yeah, you're jewel marker

1300
01:01:16,980 --> 01:01:20,360
Stop that banjo. Damn it. I'm just kidding

1301
01:01:20,360 --> 01:01:25,700
I'm sitting on Cameron side. Why on his lap?

1302
01:01:25,700 --> 01:01:31,620
Yeah, I would be jealous a little bit. Would you fall in love with me if I let you sit on my lap?

1303
01:01:31,620 --> 01:01:38,140
Yo, Santa Santa straight up. Would you fall in love with me if I asked for your heart for Christmas?

1304
01:01:38,140 --> 01:01:43,720
Would you give me your heart make it real or let's forget about it

1305
01:01:43,720 --> 01:01:46,420
I think the only thing that makes those questions funny to me is just looking

1306
01:01:46,420 --> 01:01:49,920
Patrick in the face when I ask him and just watching him try not to laugh.

1307
01:01:49,920 --> 01:01:53,120
Just when I start with... He's trying not to cry dude. Yeah, I'm trying not to fall.

1308
01:01:53,120 --> 01:01:59,920
If I asked you if you would cry, would you cry? Would you dance? No. If I asked you to dance?

1309
01:01:59,920 --> 01:02:03,640
I would not. I would dance with either of you if you asked. I think that's the thing that's making me

1310
01:02:03,640 --> 01:02:09,420
laugh the most about it is I'm imagining it as like lines from Hero by Enrique Iglesias.

1311
01:02:09,420 --> 01:02:15,260
