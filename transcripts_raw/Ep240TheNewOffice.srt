1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:13,200
All right, where are you saying Pat and we're starting nothing, maybe boost it

2
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:15,580
up a little bit. Is this better? I'll just

3
00:00:15,580 --> 00:00:22,040
wait, I do that talk test your audio. You have a cable. You can't do that. You

4
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:26,420
can't do that. It's a do that you're plugged in. I don't think anybody can

5
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:30,520
do that at all yeah. This is a this is a flop. This is an insta flop insta flop

6
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:34,120
insta. You are flopping the first action you decided to

7
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:39,760
do in the new office is you insta flopped you're not even on camera. I

8
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:43,500
don't think no you are you're on the very what are we going to do on the edge

9
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:46,160
buddy? You are on the edge. What are we going to do?

10
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:51,120
This is nothing you can't be hurt. We're not going to include that on the edit.

11
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:55,400
We're not including that. There's no fucking way. We're including that because

12
00:00:55,440 --> 00:01:01,440
We have a microphone. Just talking to the microphone. I understand, man. You're upset about the

13
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:03,160
TV writer strike.

14
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:06,400
Yeah. I'm really upset about the writer strike because I just submitted.

15
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:07,680
Think about all the shows we're about to lose, man.

16
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:13,000
I just submitted. I'm not kidding. I just submitted a packet to a show and...

17
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Abbott Elementary.

18
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,960
No, no, no. The late, late show with James Corden.

19
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:17,960
I don't really know.

20
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:20,720
And now because of the strike, that show is gone.

21
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:24,700
Yeah. It's tough for me because I kind of am running out of people now who I can send

22
00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:28,300
in my adventure time spec scripts to yeah, I kind of just have to send it to my

23
00:01:28,300 --> 00:01:31,860
parents. I just send them to everybody in the industry. I don't really want to

24
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:33,660
be seen as a scab. You don't get

25
00:01:33,660 --> 00:01:39,580
you don't get his newsletter. Is it? No, no, I haven't walked. I send it to you.

26
00:01:39,580 --> 00:01:43,860
Yeah, he has a lot of different males. Caleb pretty kitty at Gmail right. That

27
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:48,100
is not my email address. You're making me sound gay on on TV. Email. No,

28
00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:51,620
I've been sending my there's a heavy echo in here. That's okay. That's fine.

29
00:01:51,660 --> 00:01:54,660
there's nothing we can do about it. Yeah, we have a new office. Yeah, oh yeah,

30
00:01:54,660 --> 00:01:57,840
and can I say can I just I want to say something really quick, but it's a

31
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:01,380
message to everyone who fell for my hashtag hashtag one last episode,

32
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:04,460
hashtag Patrick forever. I don't think anybody actually somebody who felt

33
00:02:04,460 --> 00:02:09,020
helpful who fell for that yeah. When the hell are you going to learn that I'm a

34
00:02:09,020 --> 00:02:13,380
master troll? Yeah, when are you going to figure it out? That is true.

35
00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:18,460
Why are you still believing a single word? I fucking say, how have you not

36
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:23,780
gotten it through your thick skull that this guy is a troll master,

37
00:02:23,780 --> 00:02:28,360
unparalleled troll. They're calling... You know the troll face was based on

38
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:30,660
Cameron's face, right? Make the face right now.

39
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:35,380
See? It looks just like him. It actually kinda does. You do look trollish.

40
00:02:35,380 --> 00:02:38,300
Yeah. I would say you look ugly like a troll. You just look so

41
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:41,980
ugly today. You were saying I looked ugly earlier too.

42
00:02:41,980 --> 00:02:46,500
You just look fucking terrible today. Don't tell him he looks terrible.

43
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:51,220
I woke up. Say it behind his back like a man. I just don't like how you look today and I

44
00:02:51,220 --> 00:02:54,100
really don't want to. I didn't really take care of my appearance at all today. I kind

45
00:02:54,100 --> 00:02:57,980
of woke up and I saw your text that said I'm going into the new office and I got so excited

46
00:02:57,980 --> 00:03:01,540
that I just... No makeup. Yeah. No makeup. See I really never knew how much the makeup

47
00:03:01,540 --> 00:03:04,620
did for you until you walked in. Yeah, it's pretty important for me. And you were kind

48
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:08,660
of the reverse. You know how pregnant people are glowing? Yeah. You were kind of sucking

49
00:03:08,660 --> 00:03:13,460
the light out of everywhere you go today. You don't really glow like when you're, like

50
00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:18,940
you have makeup on you don't really glow. It's more of like a sheen. You know when you leave

51
00:03:18,940 --> 00:03:25,940
ham out? No. No, I've never. First of all, it lost me. When you leave ham out for too

52
00:03:25,940 --> 00:03:36,540
long. You know when you leave meat out for too long. When you leave meat out at a barbecue

53
00:03:37,740 --> 00:03:39,200
or like Christmas day.

54
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:41,640
Oh and it gets kind of waxy so it's looking like fake food.

55
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:43,480
It gets that sheen on it.

56
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:44,960
That's kind of like what you have.

57
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:48,320
I think that's just the fat solidifying a little bit.

58
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:51,800
Yeah and his fat has solidified all over his body.

59
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:52,800
Yeah.

60
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:55,000
I can't even be mean with her.

61
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Laughing immediately.

62
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Because you think it's so funny.

63
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
No I don't.

64
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,680
I want people to know I'm joking so I laugh.

65
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:04,120
So I can't even finish the joke.

66
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:05,840
It's okay guys I look like shit today.

67
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:10,400
you just look not like shit, just normal ugly like shit, just like I feel like

68
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:16,440
normally when I walk when you come into the room, I think a lot about if I saw

69
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:20,900
you on the street and I didn't know you when you when I with a test is if you

70
00:04:20,900 --> 00:04:21,680
walked by me,

71
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:27,560
am I turning that I'm coughing and look at and turning my head and do you go

72
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:29,440
like that's on the rear yeah

73
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:31,720
and just look right behind me.

74
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:34,640
So am I doing that

75
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:40,840
thing most of the time most of the time I say yes, but if you walk by me today

76
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:43,780
looking how you looked and you had a cup of coffee, I'd probably put change in it.

77
00:04:43,780 --> 00:04:47,980
That's how I tell you. Can I tell you why? Why? Why? Because I couldn't sleep

78
00:04:47,980 --> 00:04:51,360
last night because I was too excited about our new office. It is very I live

79
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:56,000
down the street from here. If anyone knows, I was excited for the new or for

80
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:01,040
the writer's strike because because it's kind of the same. It was the same day as

81
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:06,200
us getting the office. Yeah. And we have insider Intel. Basically, I was like

82
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:10,920
happening for me. It was like, you know, we're working hard moving stuff, getting

83
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:15,000
all tired out. I get home. I'm basically lying on the couch in my undies on my

84
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:20,600
iPad, playing Temple Run to type thing. And I see pop up on my buddies,

85
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:24,640
Instagram stories on my buddies. Yeah, all my buddies on my buddies. They're

86
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:29,760
all saying solidarity strike. We don't want to work. And I think I'm so fucking

87
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:33,020
retired and yet I had to get up, go outside with a picket sign right now

88
00:05:33,020 --> 00:05:35,200
and knock on my neighbor's door. That's right. We gotta go to the funny

89
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:38,060
mind. What are you doing? What are you like going up to every single

90
00:05:38,060 --> 00:05:40,540
neighbor in my building and say, by the way, what are you doing for the

91
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:44,140
strike? I'm saying I need your signature on this birthday card. Yes,

92
00:05:44,140 --> 00:05:46,620
but it's not a birthday card. These TV writers, I don't think people realize

93
00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:52,000
how bad it got recently. These TV writers have been living on $6,000 a

94
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:52,320
week.

95
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:56,920
What? Can you believe? That's horrible. How the fuck are you living on that?

96
00:05:56,940 --> 00:06:01,900
and they have to they have to spend the time and like emotional wavelength to

97
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:07,740
to write Barry. Yes, Dan, they only consider both. They have to consider

98
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:11,740
basically, they can only buy six Mac books a week. Yes, they can only buy

99
00:06:11,740 --> 00:06:13,300
six. How are you dude?

100
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:14,900
Okay,

101
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:20,460
okay, so that's why we're striking guys, because we are striking for a living

102
00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:25,620
wage of ten thousand dollars a week minimum for every television writer who

103
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:31,660
nights on a show about depression. Yes, dude, I will be so happy right now

104
00:06:31,660 --> 00:06:35,860
teenagers the show, which is another show. I submitted a packet for yeah,

105
00:06:35,860 --> 00:06:39,700
because I you guys know I'm trying to break into the industry. Yeah, I've

106
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:43,860
got a press teenagers. You want to work with teens in new slang word. I slang

107
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:47,980
word is for industry, so for industry and it's indo and you basically it's

108
00:06:47,980 --> 00:06:51,060
like in that's what we are now. It's also I'm realizing right now. People

109
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:55,980
all that people call weed that in smoking in oh, but that's what the I

110
00:06:55,980 --> 00:07:00,920
thought. No, that's the bike trick. I don't know that's an end. Oh yeah, yeah,

111
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:03,960
I know what the bike trick you're talking about. I think in is the

112
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:05,100
the

113
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:11,340
term to in terms because it's so smart. Yeah, I think they're going to make a

114
00:07:11,340 --> 00:07:15,480
Star Wars movie named that one anymore. Yeah, who's going to write these movies

115
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:18,200
man, I'll do it. I mean I honestly

116
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:25,980
immediately, I will if I can go in to the these striking workers jobs and I can

117
00:07:25,980 --> 00:07:30,440
go in in a mask with a voice box to this guy's my voice, a strider,

118
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:35,080
uh-huh, whoa rider, oh my like the mass magician and writers would get so mad

119
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:37,740
at you, but they don't know who I because you would give up the tricks

120
00:07:37,740 --> 00:07:41,700
like the Harmon circle. Yeah, I would tell them all about the harm.

121
00:07:42,140 --> 00:07:42,640
and they go

122
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:48,200
and not talk about the Harman circle.

123
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:53,180
You okay, I'm crying, I'm telling people all about the Harmon circle. I'm

124
00:07:53,180 --> 00:07:57,620
telling them how to draw in Cal art style. I'm releasing I'm releasing a

125
00:07:57,620 --> 00:08:01,300
hundred page coloring books of Cal art style that teach people how to draw for

126
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:04,340
the crime of releasing the Harmon circle to normies.

127
00:08:06,420 --> 00:08:12,220
you have been sentenced to one hundred hours of the big bang theory. You

128
00:08:12,220 --> 00:08:18,380
you have been sent us to one hundred hours at a coffee shop only drinking

129
00:08:18,380 --> 00:08:22,940
coffee, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,

130
00:08:22,940 --> 00:08:25,660
and everyone sees your way. That's actually a really great, but there's

131
00:08:25,660 --> 00:08:29,300
trickle down effects to this whole writer's strike. Yeah, coffee shops,

132
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:32,780
who's going to go there? Oh, my God, I can actually go to a coffee shop. Yeah,

133
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:34,580
I'm going to see and I

134
00:08:34,580 --> 00:08:39,540
can't even walk into it. I know a shop is the

135
00:08:39,540 --> 00:08:43,620
they're going to be there to typewriters. Well, art is there with their easels

136
00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:46,380
and stuff. Okay, here's my prediction. Here's my prediction. I think artists

137
00:08:46,380 --> 00:08:50,940
are going on strike soon. No painters that would actually all because of AI

138
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:53,980
they're going on strike because they don't want a I that would take my heart.

139
00:08:53,980 --> 00:09:01,460
I think that we will see as TV goes down. We will see art make a return.

140
00:09:01,540 --> 00:09:05,700
that's a really good point because and the art art has been let's be real

141
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:08,980
usurp by television. Yeah, in the last I mean, I know that's kind of a car. I

142
00:09:08,980 --> 00:09:12,720
know carlin's been there a thousand times. Yeah, but yeah, can I actually

143
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:17,600
say the writer that I just that I just thought about just now is that you know,

144
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:20,860
so these writers are going on strike right, you know, who never went on strike

145
00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:21,580
who

146
00:09:21,580 --> 00:09:27,460
painters like Pablo Picasso, yeah, inventors like Leonardo da Vinci, yes,

147
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:31,540
flyers like Amelia Earhart, one of the best people. These like these don't go

148
00:09:31,540 --> 00:09:35,640
on strike and who are they? They got their pictures and books on. Hey, here's

149
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:37,140
a question. Yeah.

150
00:09:37,140 --> 00:09:43,140
Are the guys at the news going on strike? I hope and they're going to stop

151
00:09:43,140 --> 00:09:47,480
writing this bullshit. Oh my God, that's right, because guess what I would love

152
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:50,820
the season of twenty twenty three. That's right. Can you I kind of feel

153
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:54,400
like tomorrow or today we're going to wake up. We already did, but

154
00:09:56,340 --> 00:09:59,880
today. Today we're going to wake up in the area. You're going to say, well,

155
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:05,380
it's going to be guys, the entire Ukraine and Russia war is officially on strike

156
00:10:05,380 --> 00:10:08,820
because nobody we don't have anybody to write it. Honestly, I feel like maybe

157
00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:12,360
the news writers went on strike in twenty sixteen and twenty twenty. Yeah,

158
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:15,540
and I know what I best I bet also is not going to happen this year. While the

159
00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:19,780
strike is going on mass shootings. Yeah, well, here here's the thing. Here's a

160
00:10:19,780 --> 00:10:25,020
thought TV shows cause it to here is how selfish this writer's strike is what on

161
00:10:25,060 --> 00:10:31,100
who's part about the writers, right? Yeah, yeah, okay. Think about how hard it is

162
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:36,660
for our boys in uniform boots on the ground over in Ukraine right now.

163
00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:42,940
And they can't we got about a million. They cannot watch Ted Lasso on Apple TV

164
00:10:42,940 --> 00:10:47,020
in the bunker right now. Well, yeah, that's the thing. They get back to watch

165
00:10:47,020 --> 00:10:51,140
reruns, but no new season. They get back from their fucking pumping lead into

166
00:10:51,180 --> 00:10:55,480
people's animals all day on farms all over the country and then they get back

167
00:10:55,480 --> 00:11:00,100
to their hole and they sit down. They said, I just want to watch a brand new

168
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:04,560
episode of something. Oh my God, it's a rerun. Turn the gun. No, you're

169
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:08,280
pointing a gun directly into a child, a baby's mouth, but then you turn it this

170
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:11,820
way and you blow your head off. Meanwhile, the Russians, they're over

171
00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:14,860
there. They're also like, oh my God, show every day. Well, no, they're like,

172
00:11:14,860 --> 00:11:17,580
I want to watch a new show. I want to watch a brand new episode. They load up

173
00:11:17,580 --> 00:11:20,540
up there like Russia plus or whatever they have over there. They see a

174
00:11:20,540 --> 00:11:24,060
million, they see a million new episodes of all their shows, but they're like, I

175
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:27,260
can't watch this because I will never cross a picket line. These are written by

176
00:11:27,260 --> 00:11:27,700
Scabs.

177
00:11:27,700 --> 00:11:32,420
See, I think that the Russians probably are, because they're communist piece of

178
00:11:32,420 --> 00:11:36,220
shit, they probably like reruns. They probably like reruns and they, you know

179
00:11:36,220 --> 00:11:41,180
what they really love, those commie fucks, they love strikes. Yeah, true. Actually,

180
00:11:41,180 --> 00:11:47,500
wait, strikes are fucking commie bullshit. This is the wackest TV era we've had.

181
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:48,500
this year.

182
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:54,300
Now I'm thinking about a soldier who just wants to unwind and watch Ted Lasso. He

183
00:11:54,300 --> 00:11:57,220
sees a new episode, although normal writers are on strike. So we got these

184
00:11:57,220 --> 00:12:00,020
scab writers coming. They don't know anything about the show, anything about

185
00:12:00,020 --> 00:12:03,460
the characters. So this soldier, he's trying to escape his life of bloodshed

186
00:12:03,460 --> 00:12:05,780
and destruction. He turns on Ted Lasso. He's like, I just want to watch some

187
00:12:05,780 --> 00:12:09,740
wholesome soccer. This episode, Ted Lasso is a soldier and he's getting shot at

188
00:12:09,740 --> 00:12:11,900
because the people writing it now, they don't know what the fuck the show's

189
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:15,460
about. They're going to hire these Ted Lasso, these scab writers, and you're

190
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:19,620
I'm going to turn on Ted Lasso. Ted Lasso is going to be talking like, "Duh, duh, I don't

191
00:12:19,620 --> 00:12:24,780
know what to talk about. I guess I'll play soccer. I don't know what to say. I don't

192
00:12:24,780 --> 00:12:30,420
know what to say anymore. I don't know what's happening around me. I guess I'll watch a

193
00:12:30,420 --> 00:12:31,420
rerun."

194
00:12:31,420 --> 00:12:34,420
He watches Ted Lasso in his show.

195
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:35,420
Exactly.

196
00:12:35,420 --> 00:12:37,140
Because now, because the writers strike, they can only get meta.

197
00:12:37,140 --> 00:12:40,660
These damn scab writers. We got to make the episodes. We got to fulfill the contracts,

198
00:12:40,660 --> 00:12:43,260
but they keep writing, "Duh, D-U-H-H-H."

199
00:12:43,260 --> 00:12:47,420
Yeah, because these scabs, they are not the smartest people. No, dude.

200
00:12:47,420 --> 00:12:50,620
They're hiring. That's the double-edged sword of this writer's strike. You think,

201
00:12:50,620 --> 00:12:54,580
"Oh my God, all these old writers who are writing all this crap are getting out.

202
00:12:54,580 --> 00:12:57,660
We're going to get all these new brilliant writers who are not afraid,

203
00:12:57,660 --> 00:13:02,700
who are not afraid." Who are like, "Oh, I bet I could write that." Yeah,

204
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:06,260
and then they're going to be in there. Yeah, it's going to be just these guys

205
00:13:06,260 --> 00:13:12,780
on the roofing season. Yeah. And all the jokes are like, "Oh, yeah,

206
00:13:12,780 --> 00:13:14,980
this guy used like this type of wrench yeah,

207
00:13:14,980 --> 00:13:23,500
use the wrong red. That's how that movie Idiocracy got me yeah. That was during

208
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:27,060
the last writer strike. It was to be about a bunch of smart guys, but then a

209
00:13:27,060 --> 00:13:27,500
bunch of

210
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:32,260
not very smart people who weren't professional writers in the guild. You

211
00:13:32,260 --> 00:13:34,860
know, how do you get into that? You got to be part of the gill? I don't know

212
00:13:34,860 --> 00:13:39,280
deal the guild. I think you have to do five quests yeah up here to up your

213
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:44,340
level before they let you in. You have to up your reputation level. I heard that you

214
00:13:44,340 --> 00:13:51,900
can like just kill indiscriminately. You can kill indiscriminately? And then if you kill

215
00:13:51,900 --> 00:13:57,380
the right person, they'll let you in. Yeah, I think you need to collect five goblin skins.

216
00:13:57,380 --> 00:14:05,300
What happens is you answer that little kid's prayer and you kill the lady at the orphanage

217
00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:07,820
and then they bring you into the writer's guild. What the fuck are you talking about?

218
00:14:07,820 --> 00:14:12,220
I don't know what you're talking about. The little kids prayer. No, no. All right,

219
00:14:12,220 --> 00:14:18,040
the little kids prayer. He was at the orphanage in what since Skyrim thing.

220
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:22,020
Oh yeah, that seems I don't even think that's like one of the main dark

221
00:14:22,020 --> 00:14:24,940
brotherhood quest. I thought you guys would get that. I thought you guys were

222
00:14:24,940 --> 00:14:29,020
evil like me. I'm not a 13 year old game. That's the no, it's a new game.

223
00:14:29,020 --> 00:14:33,460
They updated every week. That is true with mods. You know, they are adding

224
00:14:33,460 --> 00:14:37,460
artificial intelligence to Skyrim. I saw that they actually are. Yeah, you can.

225
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:44,100
you can put in vr you can talk to the people and say what's your favorite part

226
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:44,700
of skyro

227
00:14:44,700 --> 00:14:52,200
and they go, but I hate the dragon. No, but they don't they don't do the like

228
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:56,500
accents or anything. It's like pure text to speech voice. Oh really, I like the

229
00:14:56,500 --> 00:15:03,800
river. It's really good. Riverwood is cool. Yeah, I need to replace sky. I

230
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:07,440
I haven't played one of those games in a long time. I replayed it. The thought of playing

231
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:12,840
any game like that is so boring to me. I hate Skyrim. That's insane. I really hate Skyrim.

232
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:17,480
I don't need it. My life is amazing. I don't want to escape. The idea of escaping is fearful

233
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:23,320
to me. To me, a video game, it's toil. Yeah. You have to labor. Also, Skyrim, I don't want

234
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:28,040
to deal with bandits, and I don't want to have the idea... There's a guild that you

235
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:31,640
can join up with the bandits. Thieves Guild. I don't want to join up with bandits. I want

236
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:36,280
I'm gonna be a good man. I joined up with the thieves guild. You would I have not

237
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:39,800
complete. I'm still playing skateboarder. Of course he joined up with the thieves

238
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:44,400
guild. Yeah, he's you know he likes graph and he has friends that do graph and

239
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:48,160
writing. I know and he talked about this to me yesterday like it wasn't like I

240
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:52,600
wasn't wearing a wire and leaning in directly into his face. I said all of

241
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:56,640
their names and I said all their real legal names. Their names are all fucking

242
00:15:56,640 --> 00:15:59,600
Sputnik and Bozo. I don't fuck these guys.

243
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:05,600
These guys are clowns. They're not. They are clowns. They're actually street

244
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:09,720
artists. How would they feel if I killed their fucking mom and then did that shit

245
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:14,680
on top of their coffin? Do you think they'd think that was cool? That was

246
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:18,560
fresh? If you were a good writer. Do you think that they'd think that was ill?

247
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:22,000
And maybe if you were a good writer and you wrote a decent RIP. There's no such

248
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:22,500
R.I.P.

249
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:25,300
That's a decent R.I.P.

250
00:16:25,300 --> 00:16:26,500
R.I.P. and

251
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:28,700
decent king on it.

252
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:31,800
I think that you, you know what you should get into instead.

253
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:33,700
I would be a toy if I wrote.

254
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:34,900
You're a toy right now.

255
00:16:34,900 --> 00:16:35,800
You are my toy.

256
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:36,200
No.

257
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:38,300
Here's a, here's a thing.

258
00:16:38,300 --> 00:16:39,100
Writers strike.

259
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:41,100
How about all these writers go on strike?

260
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:42,500
BMX, skateboarding,

261
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:44,500
skiing,

262
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:45,800
snowboarding,

263
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:47,700
graffiti, horseback riding,

264
00:16:47,700 --> 00:16:49,500
horseback riding, X Games strike.

265
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:50,700
X Games horseback riding.

266
00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:57,400
We get the X Games to strike so that guys like me can join up. I get the gold

267
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:58,880
because there's no one else is skating anymore.

268
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:00,100
Is there gold in X Games?

269
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:01,320
You get a silver still.

270
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:02,800
I would maybe get the silver.

271
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:04,820
You get the silver if we know no one is competing.

272
00:17:04,820 --> 00:17:06,440
If I was competing at a skate...

273
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:07,580
We can't just give you the gold.

274
00:17:07,580 --> 00:17:08,600
Yeah, I cannot.

275
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:09,960
Put your snowman down the fucking thing.

276
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:12,220
I cannot flip my board for crap.

277
00:17:12,220 --> 00:17:14,040
Do you think that if how...

278
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:19,980
We have one try and you go on the mega ramp, do you think you would die?

279
00:17:19,980 --> 00:17:23,660
you don't get any warmups, no practices.

280
00:17:23,660 --> 00:17:26,780
You have to do... Would you die? Can you warm up on a different ramp?

281
00:17:26,780 --> 00:17:29,820
You can warm up on the... Wait, wait, who's mega ramp?

282
00:17:29,820 --> 00:17:32,740
On a miniature ramp. Who's mega ramp? The one from the X Games.

283
00:17:32,740 --> 00:17:35,860
The one from the X Games? Yeah. The big one that people get hurt on.

284
00:17:35,860 --> 00:17:39,700
The Jake Brown 2007... 2007 Jake Brown

285
00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:43,020
incident, 2007 writers strike.

286
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:46,620
Oh! We didn't know. We had nothing

287
00:17:46,620 --> 00:17:52,200
interesting to put on TV. What do we do? We make this Australian guy get his fucking kidneys

288
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:56,340
destroyed because he fell like 32 feet to the ground.

289
00:17:56,340 --> 00:17:58,340
But which really was his fault. He should have slowed.

290
00:17:58,340 --> 00:18:00,700
Yeah. Well, he was going for like a 540 or something.

291
00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:02,700
Yeah. If I was on the X Games...

292
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:04,700
$540 copay at the hospital.

293
00:18:04,700 --> 00:18:08,500
Yeah. Well, he's Australian. They pay for health care down there or something, right?

294
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:12,220
I would just try and go as high up in the air as possible and I wouldn't worry about

295
00:18:12,220 --> 00:18:16,340
what was going to happen after. I'd try to go a thousand feet up in the air and that would

296
00:18:16,340 --> 00:18:19,140
would be like I'm just going to figure out how to land later. I would put I

297
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:22,740
would put jets on the back of my skateboard. Yeah, I would be I'd be

298
00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:26,700
fully nobody ever see me again committed to going as high as possible. I hit

299
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:30,500
space. They have those robotic ones. There's like the skateboards that you

300
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:35,020
can control with like a remote. I know I saw a guy practicing that at the at the

301
00:18:35,020 --> 00:18:38,420
park the other day and it made me mad. It makes me mad too, but not as mad as

302
00:18:38,420 --> 00:18:42,540
any normal skateboarder. Yeah, because he's that's a commuters tool.

303
00:18:43,620 --> 00:18:47,420
that guy's trying to get so that's he's not using it as a he's training to be a

304
00:18:47,420 --> 00:18:52,580
spider man. Yeah, yeah, he wants to like I think skateboarders are just spider

305
00:18:52,580 --> 00:18:56,140
man. Yeah, it's just normal ones. There is there is a spider. I've been reading

306
00:18:56,140 --> 00:18:59,460
some old spider man. There is one of the guys is just a guy with a remote control

307
00:18:59,460 --> 00:19:03,540
skateboard. Really? Yeah, he's called the rocket writer. Really? Wow,

308
00:19:03,540 --> 00:19:08,740
they had they just suck. They was dude. It's the funniest thing that I've been

309
00:19:08,740 --> 00:19:11,300
reading through all like the old ones from the sixties and seventies and the

310
00:19:11,300 --> 00:19:14,600
the funniest thing that I that like I picked up on that, like they just write

311
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:17,940
the same story over and over yeah like and the funniest thing is that

312
00:19:17,940 --> 00:19:22,660
literally every single issue has has whenever Spider Man gets in a fight with

313
00:19:22,660 --> 00:19:28,240
the villain. Where you going buddy? So we on this are kind of hard. The wheels

314
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:33,380
on these chairs are like scooter wheels. Yes, I almost fell away. What were you

315
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:37,300
saying? Every single issue in every fight with every villain, there's always

316
00:19:37,340 --> 00:19:42,040
we've seen the first punch that somebody throws the other person always plays

317
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:45,320
possum and the person is like as a speech bubble like. I think I knocked

318
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:48,860
him out, but he might be faking it and it literally had like like two hundred

319
00:19:48,860 --> 00:19:51,760
issues. It happens every time it's so funny to imagine

320
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:56,460
fighting a guy and every time he punches someone they could just play dead and he

321
00:19:56,460 --> 00:20:00,660
falls for it every single time. I would do a spider man punch me yeah I'm

322
00:20:00,660 --> 00:20:04,040
playing dead. Well, they just all play. They always play dead and then five

323
00:20:04,100 --> 00:20:07,360
seconds later they go. I was tricking you and they punch him back and he falls

324
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:12,560
for every single time. I would I would crawl away. I would like not even not

325
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:17,400
even engage him anymore in the fight. You'd get a rip his clothes off. You

326
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:21,440
would marry spot. You would be doing upside down kisses to spider man. So

327
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:27,200
not me, not me. I'd be taking razor blades. That means that means that I

328
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:30,640
would get to meet all the guys in the cubes. I get to meet all the other cool

329
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:36,060
people in the justice. He doesn't have any friends. He has no friends. He's the

330
00:20:36,060 --> 00:20:40,780
youngest one so they bully him. And everyone hates him because of J Jonah

331
00:20:40,780 --> 00:20:44,900
Jameson. So shows what you fucking know about Spider-Man. I don't know anything

332
00:20:44,900 --> 00:20:48,660
about Spider-Man. He's a public menace. My nephews like that song that goes

333
00:20:48,660 --> 00:20:51,660
*singing*

334
00:20:51,660 --> 00:20:56,620
Oh Post Malone. Is that about Spider-Man? It's in Spider-Man. It's about Miles

335
00:20:56,620 --> 00:21:01,980
so that was I didn't know that I thought it was flower. No, it's a sunflower. No,

336
00:21:01,980 --> 00:21:08,340
not when my nephew sees it by down. You're a spider man. No, it's not that

337
00:21:08,340 --> 00:21:08,700
either.

338
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:10,380
You're a spider.

339
00:21:10,380 --> 00:21:14,060
I would believe

340
00:21:14,060 --> 00:21:20,140
on the room. I would believe that post one would write a song called Spider Man

341
00:21:20,140 --> 00:21:24,060
about how he's Spider Man. That guy needs to get it together. He just he just

342
00:21:24,100 --> 00:21:27,060
been on that weight loss drug. Have you seen a video of him recently? Dude, he

343
00:21:27,060 --> 00:21:30,400
looks insane. I know somebody who's on that weight loss drug. I was listening

344
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:33,360
to an Adam Ragusea podcast about that weight loss drug today. Is he cooking

345
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:33,900
with it?

346
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:39,700
Here's my ozempic omelette.

347
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:46,700
He's just injecting an omelette with ozempic.

348
00:21:46,700 --> 00:21:50,840
You should in general be injecting food. Yeah, I don't think you should be

349
00:21:50,860 --> 00:21:54,860
that's what when people say food science, I know we've talked about this. You want

350
00:21:54,860 --> 00:21:58,700
it to be a beaker yeah beakers and stuff, but yeah, you should have to be

351
00:21:58,700 --> 00:22:03,940
injecting stuff. You have to be taking like treating it like the only real

352
00:22:03,940 --> 00:22:08,820
heartbeat. The only real food scientist. If we're going by this logic is Tony

353
00:22:08,820 --> 00:22:13,860
Sashory, who that the Creole seasoning guy, the little chef who goes like

354
00:22:13,860 --> 00:22:20,260
a little Cajun, little green Cajun big. It's like he's this big on the box.

355
00:22:20,260 --> 00:22:23,840
of the seasoning. I don't know the box, man. You don't know Tony. You got to get some Tony

356
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:29,020
Sachery's for your French fries. It's real good. But he's a scientist? He also makes

357
00:22:29,020 --> 00:22:35,700
an injectable butter. Oh, yeah. A butter is not. I'm thinking more chemicals that you

358
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:41,140
put in. Flavonoids. What's a flavonoid? MSG? Definitely a flavonoid. Is that a flavonoid?

359
00:22:41,140 --> 00:22:44,740
I don't know. I've heard flavonoid and they sound... Don't they sound amazing? Don't they

360
00:22:44,740 --> 00:22:48,460
sound like a little creature from another planet or country that tastes amazing? I'm

361
00:22:48,460 --> 00:22:52,520
I'm a flame annoying yeah and I would eat them instantly. Yeah, you grate them

362
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:52,860
against

363
00:22:52,860 --> 00:22:57,740
that sounds so good. You have to catch them in the jungle yeah. You have to go

364
00:22:57,740 --> 00:23:00,080
on an expedition with a big butterfly in it. Yeah, it's like a

365
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:04,260
rainbow. They're all different colors, like a little pick man kind of guy.

366
00:23:04,260 --> 00:23:04,440
Yeah,

367
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:09,580
no, we don't want he doesn't like it. No, yeah, you don't want to be

368
00:23:09,580 --> 00:23:15,820
to hunt them down. Yeah, you have to bait them out. You put it like you put

369
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:19,520
leaves on the ground over like a pitfall and you sprinkle like salt on the

370
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:20,640
leaves and they come out. They

371
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:24,720
they smell the salt, but some of them to get like the different ones. You got to

372
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:30,440
this amazing video game idea. It is a no, it's flavonoid. The first baseline

373
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:34,120
you bait them with different things, a different types of sweet, savory,

374
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:34,760
umami,

375
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:42,200
garlic guys, garlic guys and garlic girls, garlic girls, mushroom,

376
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:43,500
the girls are in the deals

377
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:49,040
who else do we got in here? These are the different kind. These are different

378
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:49,800
kind of flavonoid

379
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:54,040
orange juice,

380
00:23:54,040 --> 00:23:56,600
orange juice.

381
00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:58,800
This is smurfs.

382
00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:02,960
I've such a good idea, though,

383
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:08,160
if you let your base spoil. If you put the wrong day, you have to be careful,

384
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:10,160
because sometimes you'll be like catching. It's like, oh my God, I'm

385
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:14,460
much. I caught like fifty sweet fellows and these are like the sweet ones and

386
00:24:14,460 --> 00:24:17,060
then it's like right then you got it. You got to close the cage right then,

387
00:24:17,060 --> 00:24:19,540
because who's running up who missed a poop

388
00:24:19,540 --> 00:24:23,540
he's a big fat flame annoyed and he tastes like poop, and if he gets into

389
00:24:23,540 --> 00:24:24,020
your he gets you

390
00:24:24,020 --> 00:24:28,820
them. So you have to you have to like it's all like a game of like okay, I

391
00:24:28,820 --> 00:24:31,220
got to leave this this cage open long enough that all my

392
00:24:31,220 --> 00:24:35,420
but here's the hours can use the crawling. It's like that it's like that

393
00:24:35,420 --> 00:24:38,440
one game that would do, but the thing drops happy bird. Here's the twist of

394
00:24:38,460 --> 00:24:42,560
game though. So you're working for like a food corporation, right?

395
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:44,260
You're like, and they're like, we need you to go to them.

396
00:24:44,260 --> 00:24:47,980
And at the CEO of the food corporation is Emeril, is Emeril Legassi.

397
00:24:47,980 --> 00:24:50,820
And he's like, you need to, bam,

398
00:24:50,820 --> 00:24:54,380
you need to go into the woods and catch all these fucking flavonoids.

399
00:24:54,380 --> 00:24:55,980
And then...

400
00:24:55,980 --> 00:24:57,660
Wait, what is it? It gives you a mission?

401
00:24:57,660 --> 00:24:59,460
Is he just a CIA?

402
00:24:59,460 --> 00:25:01,740
Your mission is you have to go into this,

403
00:25:01,740 --> 00:25:03,620
this it's like the Amazon rainforest.

404
00:25:03,620 --> 00:25:04,700
You're a freelancer by the way.

405
00:25:04,700 --> 00:25:06,300
You're an agent.

406
00:25:06,300 --> 00:25:08,100
The first mission is you fill out a 1099.

407
00:25:08,100 --> 00:25:12,140
Yeah. So you're working for this big corporation. You go into the woods. You

408
00:25:12,140 --> 00:25:17,660
have to catch all the flavonoids. Okay. Then what happens? The flavonoids catch

409
00:25:17,660 --> 00:25:24,300
you in a big net Ewok style. Then you find out it's like Avatar. You become

410
00:25:24,300 --> 00:25:28,660
on the side of the flavonoids. You can have your character creation. You pick

411
00:25:28,660 --> 00:25:33,140
which flavor you want to be. Yes. And you're fucking a hamburger girlfriend.

412
00:25:33,140 --> 00:25:35,980
Based on things that you did in like the first half of the game. Yeah, it

413
00:25:35,980 --> 00:25:39,560
game. It's like a paternity test. It determines what kind of flavonoid you

414
00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:43,980
are. That's amazing. Oh, man, I got Mr. Poop. Yeah. I got Mr. Poop too many

415
00:25:43,980 --> 00:25:48,380
times. It scans your body and it-- It scans your face. You are Mr. Boob.

416
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:53,940
No, I would be chocolate. Yeah, then the end of the game is a big flavor

417
00:25:53,940 --> 00:25:57,700
competition. I would probably be water flavor. Wait, but this is not making

418
00:25:57,700 --> 00:26:01,780
any sense. The end of the game is a cook off. Why are you turning into--

419
00:26:01,780 --> 00:26:03,780
How do you turn into a flavonoid? Maybe that would be like the-- You know what

420
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:08,500
already know a flavonoid. You just this would be become become on the side of

421
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:09,380
the this would be the

422
00:26:09,380 --> 00:26:15,120
twist. I'm giant, but I have a tiny flavonoid girlfriend. No, you yeah, I

423
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:19,460
guess you're a giant and then you have a tiny flavonoid girlfriend who is forty

424
00:26:19,460 --> 00:26:20,920
five and

425
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:24,880
but they live till ten thousand. So she's like three years old. I don't

426
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:25,920
think I would want to be

427
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:30,920
I don't think I would want to be involved with

428
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:35,620
Well, you can choose to you can choose flavonoid at the end of the game. You

429
00:26:35,620 --> 00:26:38,340
work with the flavonoids and learn their lifestyle. Then at the end of the game,

430
00:26:38,340 --> 00:26:43,480
you make a choice. Do I go back and work for Emeril's company? I know what it

431
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:47,240
actually is. I don't know what it's actually gonna be. What? No, no, no. What

432
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:51,840
is this? No, no, no, no. This is it's actually the whole thing. It's it's a

433
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:56,140
multiplayer, asymmetrical multiplayer, like dead by daylight. You either play

434
00:26:56,140 --> 00:27:00,360
as a flavonoid or as a chef. So if you're a flavonoid, you gotta run away.

435
00:27:00,380 --> 00:27:06,380
Yeah, yeah, and do have a society. I guess yeah, you can air it kind of just

436
00:27:06,380 --> 00:27:09,900
pitch like a visual novel, basically like a like a dating simulator. I was

437
00:27:09,900 --> 00:27:12,940
thinking maybe like the first one, the first game in the series. Well, that's

438
00:27:12,940 --> 00:27:15,900
like a storyline. This is the multiplayer game. The first game in the

439
00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:18,420
series. You're just a chef and you're catching the flavonoids and the second

440
00:27:18,420 --> 00:27:20,780
game. It's like a plot twist at the beginning where it's like it's like the

441
00:27:20,780 --> 00:27:23,380
metal Metal Gear Solid thing where it's like, oh, I'm gonna be playing a chef,

442
00:27:23,380 --> 00:27:26,980
but then boom, you're actually a flavonoid the rest of the game. Yeah,

443
00:27:26,980 --> 00:27:30,020
and that's like ape escape, but for flavonoids, I like both of your ideas

444
00:27:30,020 --> 00:27:35,980
and metal. I will say in Star Wars, the fact that they are made of flavors has

445
00:27:35,980 --> 00:27:37,340
almost nothing to do with either.

446
00:27:37,340 --> 00:27:43,180
What are you talking about? Because the the the flavor of the chef Corporation,

447
00:27:43,180 --> 00:27:47,380
either one of these could have been Smurfs. No, because you are a psychopath.

448
00:27:47,380 --> 00:27:50,500
If you I guess it could be Smurfs. If you took out all the flavor and cooking

449
00:27:50,500 --> 00:27:53,980
and chefs, that's a good point. But instead of a fucking idiot, Gargamel or

450
00:27:53,980 --> 00:27:56,980
somebody like Gargamel. Okay, if you want to try and get that license, that's

451
00:27:56,980 --> 00:28:01,540
all you but that's how you're going to be able to pitch it. Did I just create the Smurfs?

452
00:28:01,540 --> 00:28:04,660
Is that what it does? Gargamel wanted to eat the Smurfs. He wants to turn them into gold.

453
00:28:04,660 --> 00:28:08,140
Oh, I thought he was trying to turn them into food, but it's might might as well be the

454
00:28:08,140 --> 00:28:11,020
same thing. He wants them for something they don't want to be doing. Yeah, but this is

455
00:28:11,020 --> 00:28:15,180
different because imagine if Gargamel had a big corporation that makes a big mouth instead

456
00:28:15,180 --> 00:28:20,260
of a big nose McDonald's fries. The guy with the big nose wants to turn the Smurfs into

457
00:28:20,260 --> 00:28:27,460
to gold. Yeah, you never realize this. No, this is a crack.com article. Yeah,

458
00:28:27,460 --> 00:28:32,060
no, there's a writer. Blue guys are the good guys. What?

459
00:28:32,060 --> 00:28:36,580
No, there's a writer strike. We can't even write this crack.com article. Yeah,

460
00:28:36,580 --> 00:28:40,100
what is crack.com? There's no writer strike for video games. There's a writer

461
00:28:40,100 --> 00:28:44,980
strike for... I kinda feel like this office could be a video game developer's

462
00:28:44,980 --> 00:28:47,940
office. We should write a video game. We're gonna be in Indie Game, the movie

463
00:28:47,940 --> 00:28:53,340
I'm down yeah, I would be down to make a video. I would be down to honestly make a

464
00:28:53,340 --> 00:28:58,020
flavonoids, we play the noise video. I think it's a really good, but we just

465
00:28:58,020 --> 00:29:01,180
need I'm telling you, I just need some reason. It's like my

466
00:29:01,180 --> 00:29:05,980
noids because you come back and you cook with the flavonoids yeah wait. So

467
00:29:05,980 --> 00:29:08,900
there's a cooking mama. So yeah, that's the whole thing. I will do that.

468
00:29:08,900 --> 00:29:12,980
This sounds like that's the whole perfect video. Can we add it? Can it be

469
00:29:12,980 --> 00:29:16,820
like concourse bad for day? The I always say concourse is

470
00:29:16,820 --> 00:29:22,280
conker concore conker concore, like a hundred and fifty. That's how my

471
00:29:22,280 --> 00:29:25,040
brother used to say it concores bad

472
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:31,420
can it be like that where there's Conan the Barbie Conan Conan. That's how

473
00:29:31,420 --> 00:29:34,440
Conan is how I say it. I think that's how you're supposed to say it. I'm

474
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:39,260
saying concord like it's cool. How come Conan O'Brien is Conan because he is

475
00:29:39,260 --> 00:29:44,560
wimpy, not a barbarian. Well, concord is a bad ass. He is for they kind of look

476
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:46,600
was he a dog? He's a fur baby.

477
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:52,280
Conker and Conan have red hair. I was going to say fur baby. Were you going to

478
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:55,500
say fur baby? Yeah, I don't know why. I know he calls his dog a fur baby. Oh my

479
00:29:55,500 --> 00:30:00,600
God, we're not around. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. I call him shit. I hate him,

480
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:06,040
but can it be like Conker? Where? Conker. I guess that is just the word

481
00:30:06,040 --> 00:30:11,320
Conker. Yeah, that's the joke. I thought his name was Conker. No. It's such a

482
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:16,360
crazy. I never ride that be anything's name because it's cooler. It's a cooler

483
00:30:16,360 --> 00:30:18,000
cave man, concord

484
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:22,660
can it be like that where there's violence and sexual nudity. I think

485
00:30:22,660 --> 00:30:26,640
there should be a toggle in the setting so you can turn on nudity. Yeah, maybe

486
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:30,280
the first game is like an innocent, like first game will be for any s and it

487
00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:33,560
will come out a long time ago. Did you guys hear

488
00:30:33,560 --> 00:30:39,760
and then we can go from there and then we'll be pretty by now we'll be pretty

489
00:30:41,320 --> 00:30:46,580
did you hear about this game that I cannot remember the name of now I

490
00:30:46,580 --> 00:30:51,160
haven't heard of that has options for people who get scared of stuff. Oh,

491
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:52,540
they oh yeah the game that

492
00:30:52,540 --> 00:30:57,300
yeah it was the horizon game right and you can yeah well what I didn't

493
00:30:57,300 --> 00:31:01,440
understand you can turn the water afraid of the water, but you can't even turn

494
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:04,140
the water. I was reading it and it's like what all you can do is like it

495
00:31:04,140 --> 00:31:08,780
turns down the like ocean sounds okay, and it makes your character be able to

496
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:13,340
you're a reader of water and yeah, I guess I guess I never like I think this

497
00:31:13,340 --> 00:31:16,300
fear is that you're like it literally said in the thing. It was like the fear

498
00:31:16,300 --> 00:31:19,520
that they're trying to like the fear that people have is like of being in the

499
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:22,240
deep ocean. You can't see and there might be something in there with you and

500
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:24,600
it's that so we're doing is we're turning off some of the water effects

501
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:29,200
and you can breathe. That is a fear that one developer had. I got that fear.

502
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:34,240
That's a fear that one ever not for a video game. Everybody's fucking afraid of

503
00:31:34,840 --> 00:31:38,280
drowning to death. I don't think that's the thing. It's not even the fear of

504
00:31:38,280 --> 00:31:41,900
drowning. It's the fear of like there's a yeah, it's it's a it's one of the

505
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:46,380
reddit fears. Yeah. Oh, yeah. Well, like the one with the iPhone cameras. Yeah,

506
00:31:46,380 --> 00:31:49,100
yeah, actually, it's one of the it's one of the ones where it's like I'm I'm

507
00:31:49,100 --> 00:31:53,480
afraid of like something cosmic and I know I'm afraid of it's a napkins

508
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:58,680
touching. It's a phobia that like you hear about like tryptophobia or whatever

509
00:31:58,680 --> 00:32:04,380
like, oh my God, you spilled over the new office for it's like tryptophobia or

510
00:32:04,380 --> 00:32:08,400
or whatever, like the fear of tiny holes like no one that's what no one had that

511
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:13,820
fear until they read about it. I like yeah, because you can put pencils in

512
00:32:13,820 --> 00:32:17,420
back in the day, people used to like tiny holes. Now it's all about big

513
00:32:17,420 --> 00:32:21,780
nowadays. These girls are getting surgery to make their holes bigger.

514
00:32:21,780 --> 00:32:26,580
They get surgery to make their but I've heard about this. He's right.

515
00:32:26,580 --> 00:32:30,740
Girls are you serious to make their butthole? You can put a great three

516
00:32:30,780 --> 00:32:34,800
counts. I put a grapefruit in a girl's, but now because all the so you're going

517
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:37,800
to do that for a while. They started with golf balls. That was the first ball

518
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:40,340
they got put in a but soon they're going to be putting soccer balls up there

519
00:32:40,340 --> 00:32:43,280
soon. They're going to be putting fucking bowling balls, sixteen pounders

520
00:32:43,280 --> 00:32:46,520
directly into women's. Well, the weight doesn't matter that much. You tell

521
00:32:46,520 --> 00:32:50,360
that okay, well, let's put a fucking you try sixteen pounders a two pound. I

522
00:32:50,360 --> 00:32:51,920
got sixteen pounds in my book

523
00:32:56,520 --> 00:32:58,320
as long as it's man and skinny, it's

524
00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:00,480
a bowling ball

525
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:03,160
compared to a soccer ball. It's pretty thin

526
00:33:03,160 --> 00:33:07,720
actually rather narrow. I guess yeah, a soccer ball pop in my butt. I think

527
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:13,040
they make those. You're not you're not like that, bro. You are not tight like I

528
00:33:13,040 --> 00:33:18,120
am. They make those butts loose as hell. Now his butts loose as fuck. They make

529
00:33:18,120 --> 00:33:23,000
that is not true. You can put a whole I've never had. I have I only have

530
00:33:23,040 --> 00:33:27,200
diarrhea because my butt is so tight that it just squeezes into a million little

531
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:28,240
pieces when it comes out.

532
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:32,440
Like the book? It won't come out as... Yeah, like the book because you're a

533
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:37,520
liar. No, I'm not a liar. And that book is real. That book is real? No, I wish

534
00:33:37,520 --> 00:33:38,960
it was. Yeah. What's the...

535
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:41,120
I remember...

536
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:46,240
It was on... You remember that? I remember seeing the Oprah episode with

537
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:50,600
my mom. Yeah, and then he got exposed. Where Oprah's like, "You are a lying

538
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:53,440
piece of shit. And he's like, "What? Who gives a fuck, bitch?"

539
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:59,280
Hey, Oprah. Yeah. Hey, everyone, check under your seats. Now, look up.

540
00:33:59,280 --> 00:34:05,200
Double burrs, here's what you got. I'm out. That's how it ended. We should do

541
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:09,120
the Oprah... He flipped everyone off. We should do the Oprah set here.

542
00:34:09,120 --> 00:34:12,400
That should be the set. That would be a good idea. Sure. One to one

543
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:16,640
recreation of Oprah. I do think that the Oprah set looked amazing.

544
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:21,960
I can picture it right now. Yeah, I think you're blue and the floor is kind of our

545
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:26,600
Oprah set floor. So chairs, lots of chairs, studio audience, mommies in the

546
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:31,960
crowd. I would like to get on the stage all around mommies all around. I would

547
00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:35,440
like to get as many mommies in this office as humanly possible. I think if

548
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:39,800
we put a box of wine, oh, I just remember my internship was next to the

549
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:44,440
Oprah offices. I'll go back. I'll go talk to them. Harpo Harpo Productions.

550
00:34:44,520 --> 00:34:47,720
yeah, that was the name of what her production company was Harpo

551
00:34:47,720 --> 00:34:51,560
production some clownish name. I don't know. Well, spell it backwards. I said

552
00:34:51,560 --> 00:34:53,800
yeah, because I thought he was saying something crazy. Oh my God,

553
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:55,320
I just

554
00:34:55,320 --> 00:35:00,480
spell that back to the incredible. Are you crying? I didn't mean to, but I'm

555
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:04,200
crying a little bit because of what he just said. What did he say? Say it

556
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:09,280
Harpo is Oprah backwards. Oh my God, isn't that crazy?

557
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:15,160
that's like a be like office. Oh my God, we're in no they had an elevator. We

558
00:35:15,160 --> 00:35:18,600
were not allowed to use that's Oprah's elevator. They said yeah, it was

559
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:20,760
literally you're not allowed up there. You're not allowed up there because

560
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:23,960
you know, not allowed to go. If you go in Oprah's elevator, you take it to the

561
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:27,400
at the floor. It says s that's Stedman's one time. It was an elevator that went

562
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:31,000
that opened on our in our office on our floor and we weren't allowed to go on

563
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:36,240
one time when I was younger. We were and I was in California and we were doing

564
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:43,120
we were driving and we my little my baby brother he shit his diaper yeah we had

565
00:35:43,120 --> 00:35:48,760
to pull over to change his diaper and we did it and it was Oprah's house in the

566
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:55,040
driveway oh yeah yeah there's a big Oh and stuff and you had a big Oh the

567
00:35:55,040 --> 00:36:03,560
security he saw his little brother shit I saw Oprah's security guard yeah and I

568
00:36:03,560 --> 00:36:07,560
was it Stedman? I don't know who Stedman is. I think that's her.

569
00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:11,560
Stedman is like her boyfriend, not boyfriend or something.

570
00:36:11,560 --> 00:36:15,560
I thought that fucking Roger Ebert was her boyfriend, not boyfriend.

571
00:36:15,560 --> 00:36:19,560
You are insane for that. They dated. They dated?

572
00:36:19,560 --> 00:36:23,560
Yeah, I don't know. Yeah, they dated in the 90s. I think

573
00:36:23,560 --> 00:36:27,560
Stedman. Stedman is Oprah's best friend.

574
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:31,560
Nobody's actually named Stedman, man. No, Dr. Phil is Oprah's best friend.

575
00:36:31,560 --> 00:36:35,000
you've seen television. I've seen a lot more Oprah than you. That's probably

576
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:38,640
true. That's what I learned. That's what I learned about breast cancer as a kid,

577
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:43,040
and then I saw Mewtwo. There was a breast cancer report. Mewtwo. There was a

578
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:47,360
breast cancer report I saw of, it was a picture, Oprah, on the show of a

579
00:36:47,360 --> 00:36:50,320
mastectomy, and then I saw... It kind of looked like Mewtwo's chest, no

580
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:55,400
nipples. I told my mom, I asked my mom, "Does Mewtwo have breast cancer?"

581
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:57,680
(laughter)

582
00:36:57,680 --> 00:36:59,880
- Because I saw his like,

583
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:01,540
(laughter)

584
00:37:01,540 --> 00:37:02,380
- Oh my God.

585
00:37:02,380 --> 00:37:04,620
(laughter)

586
00:37:04,620 --> 00:37:05,460
- I think,

587
00:37:05,460 --> 00:37:08,160
- Did Mewtwo have breast cancer?

588
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:09,000
- I think Mewtwo,

589
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:12,000
- She got mad at me because she thought I was joking.

590
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,960
- I kind of wanted to fuck Mewtwo until,

591
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:14,800
- Mewtwo was a sexual awakening.

592
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:16,080
- Until I heard his voice.

593
00:37:16,080 --> 00:37:16,920
- Yeah.

594
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:17,740
- In the Pokemon.

595
00:37:17,740 --> 00:37:19,120
- Yeah, I thought Mewtwo was a girl.

596
00:37:19,120 --> 00:37:19,960
- Me too.

597
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:20,780
If they had given,

598
00:37:20,780 --> 00:37:23,920
they made such a correct decision by giving him

599
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:28,860
the deep man's voice. Yeah. If they had given him a sexy girls, they had given

600
00:37:28,860 --> 00:37:32,920
him like the most hottest girl's voice. If they had so they should now do the

601
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:36,720
voice on that, that would have been. Does any be playing the ukulele and shit?

602
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:40,200
No, he's not. So he's not. It just would be the voice. It would just be. No,

603
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:43,720
it's not the right voice. You got to get like a like a like a

604
00:37:43,720 --> 00:37:46,720
female voice who would fit me to

605
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:51,120
okay. Like Oprah. Oprah would not have. I would not. Oprah does not have a

606
00:37:52,120 --> 00:37:54,720
Mmm fucking Michelle

607
00:37:54,720 --> 00:38:00,060
Michelle who's Michelle from the I don't know

608
00:38:00,060 --> 00:38:04,480
What I'm trying to think of of one of you to have that I was gonna say

609
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:09,320
Baby

610
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:15,200
I don't think that would have done it for me Gwendolyn Christie whose armor from you to had robot armor

611
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:18,520
I was just trying to get out of this. Yeah. Yeah, I don't talk about Michelle

612
00:38:18,520 --> 00:38:21,720
I don't have anything about the robot armor. I was gonna say Michelle Quan

613
00:38:21,720 --> 00:38:23,720
on. I don't even know that is

614
00:38:23,720 --> 00:38:28,520
you have anything else really boring. I bet Patrick wanted to

615
00:38:28,520 --> 00:38:29,520
fuck me. You know,

616
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:35,420
whatever happened to me three. I like me too, but he's too big.

617
00:38:35,420 --> 00:38:39,520
Whatever I am you three. I didn't want to fuck you. I want

618
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:42,960
to be me. You yeah, it was a thing. I made up when I was a

619
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:45,360
kid. Really, what did it look like? Everybody made up your

620
00:38:45,360 --> 00:38:47,980
three when they were a kid. It looked like shit terrible.

621
00:38:48,520 --> 00:38:53,400
I think I think everybody who who liked Pokemon as a kid drew a picture of me

622
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:56,960
three. That was the worst picture they ever drew. I mean I didn't draw. I go.

623
00:38:56,960 --> 00:39:00,640
It was too embarrassing of all my drawings. I'm so bad at drawing man. I'm

624
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:05,720
okay drawing. I think that I would like to I'm really bad at drawing, but I'm a

625
00:39:05,720 --> 00:39:09,480
really good painter. I want to get good at three things. I want to learn how to

626
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:17,280
draw. I want to learn Spanish yeah, and I would like to do a high line type

627
00:39:17,320 --> 00:39:22,780
a tight type rope yeah. Oh on to like to sky, you want to be a type rope walker.

628
00:39:22,780 --> 00:39:26,220
I want to be a type rope Walker and I want to walk very I want to be the

629
00:39:26,220 --> 00:39:28,340
fastest fastest and I want to be really scared.

630
00:39:28,340 --> 00:39:30,480
You run all the way

631
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:36,520
because I don't like this style of the guys who do they do this thing where

632
00:39:36,520 --> 00:39:41,700
they hold the thing yeah and they think no thing also one no thing and I'm

633
00:39:41,700 --> 00:39:46,220
going to hold my breath and run as fast as possible all the way down. That's

634
00:39:46,260 --> 00:39:51,620
I want. Yeah. What about like a highline tightrope, but it's slanted? What if you're the first

635
00:39:51,620 --> 00:39:56,920
slanted guy? Yeah. Oh, and also I always had this idea, which is that you set it in between

636
00:39:56,920 --> 00:40:03,260
your ass cheeks and you kind of use your body like a zip line and you just kind of and you

637
00:40:03,260 --> 00:40:06,300
hold your balls up. You hold your balls all like as high up as I go, so they don't get

638
00:40:06,300 --> 00:40:12,660
turned into nothing. I notice your hands at your chest. I have long. I have long ones.

639
00:40:12,660 --> 00:40:18,000
I've said this before, I have pretty long stretchers. Yeah, that turn, you know,

640
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:22,960
like, okay, so if you take your balls personally, your, your ball sack and you

641
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:25,980
flatten it out. If you personally take your balls. If you, yeah, if you do it

642
00:40:25,980 --> 00:40:31,140
yourself and you pull it as far out as possible. Uh huh. Stretch it. Show me

643
00:40:31,140 --> 00:40:34,980
with your, yeah, show me with your, with your hands how wide that would be. I

644
00:40:34,980 --> 00:40:38,900
don't, I haven't stretched it. You don't do that in the bath. Probably about this,

645
00:40:39,220 --> 00:40:43,320
this wide? Let me think probably the length that's respect of the length of

646
00:40:43,320 --> 00:40:45,800
my pants. So show the show the camera.

647
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:51,240
We'll just do it with your hands. You don't have to show that they can't see

648
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:56,020
that on the thing. I would be probably like I might be like maybe here. I

649
00:40:56,020 --> 00:40:59,940
think I honestly might be that big for real with my sack. Well, that means

650
00:40:59,940 --> 00:41:02,660
you know what that means, right? We know that means yeah,

651
00:41:02,660 --> 00:41:06,920
I literally look it looks like I used to have giant balls.

652
00:41:07,820 --> 00:41:11,500
I lost the dog who just went on a diet. Yeah, yeah, you know, you know what that

653
00:41:11,500 --> 00:41:16,300
means, though. That's how big your your pussy would be. I know for real. That's

654
00:41:16,300 --> 00:41:19,980
what I'm saying, bro. This guy's not tight. Yeah, I think that if I was a girl,

655
00:41:19,980 --> 00:41:26,380
I'd have the fucking most huge shit ever. Yeah, yeah, you'd have beagle ears

656
00:41:26,380 --> 00:41:31,660
between your legs. I'd have beagle labia flaps and ears. Your leg would look

657
00:41:31,660 --> 00:41:35,220
your your pussy would look like a basset hound. I think that my

658
00:41:35,220 --> 00:41:36,220
Yeah,

659
00:41:36,220 --> 00:41:43,180
it would look at home in a Sherlock Holmes.

660
00:41:43,180 --> 00:41:51,080
I think that your your would look like the curtains into a fortune tellers

661
00:41:51,080 --> 00:41:51,740
caravan.

662
00:41:51,740 --> 00:41:59,180
No, I would have my would actually look really no, it would no, it would look

663
00:41:59,180 --> 00:42:01,720
yeah, it would look like two glass doors. No, yeah,

664
00:42:02,740 --> 00:42:09,060
really flat. It wouldn't be flat. It'd be I would have a juicy ass. You'd have a

665
00:42:09,060 --> 00:42:14,100
juicy. No, you're just the show would be dry as fuck all the time. My dude, they

666
00:42:14,100 --> 00:42:18,420
call you. They call you Sahara. Girls say like,

667
00:42:18,420 --> 00:42:26,860
my pussy's fucking dry. Fuck me. They got to put pH strips up there. I heard

668
00:42:26,860 --> 00:42:31,940
yeah. P. H. A. T. Strips because that thing I heard from girls that I know

669
00:42:32,180 --> 00:42:36,340
they have to put a PH strip up there like they're testing a pool. Yeah,

670
00:42:36,340 --> 00:42:43,180
if it's all messed up, they do have to put a powder up there to a powder,

671
00:42:43,180 --> 00:42:47,940
powder. It's chlorine. If I had one powder be coming out of there, yeah,

672
00:42:47,940 --> 00:42:52,900
all the time, it'd be like when you when you like, I'd be triggering hard and

673
00:42:52,900 --> 00:42:55,860
the corn starch starts flying everywhere. Men would try to eat me out and I'd

674
00:42:55,860 --> 00:42:57,140
be triggering their allergies.

675
00:42:59,540 --> 00:43:03,260
if I had a something you to mitt pollen, I'm going to say something really,

676
00:43:03,260 --> 00:43:06,840
really nasty, but mine would have some kind of substance that looked like rice

677
00:43:06,840 --> 00:43:10,740
yeah and it would come out all the time. What those would be your eggs? That's

678
00:43:10,740 --> 00:43:13,720
it. I don't know what it would be, but I'd be coming out and I'd be like

679
00:43:13,720 --> 00:43:16,900
wearing a scurvy going down my leg. Some guy be eating me out and he'd be like

680
00:43:16,900 --> 00:43:22,100
pot of silica gel packet for his fucking tongue. Yeah, because it's so you need

681
00:43:22,100 --> 00:43:25,020
to keep it dry. So no oxygen, so it doesn't oxidize. Mine would have a

682
00:43:25,020 --> 00:43:27,220
tongue. Yeah, I might have a beak.

683
00:43:29,260 --> 00:43:35,420
I think my would have wings like wings, not like like name or wings. Yes,

684
00:43:35,420 --> 00:43:40,820
exactly like name or wing. My pussy would have wings. Hey, my pussy. Come

685
00:43:40,820 --> 00:43:45,740
on man. Yeah, don't don't don't swear. We have neighbors who can hear us.

686
00:43:45,740 --> 00:43:48,780
No, they can't. They can hear us. They don't want to hear. You guys would be

687
00:43:48,780 --> 00:43:52,540
able to hear us saying pussy ad ad nauseam. I would have one of the loud

688
00:43:52,540 --> 00:43:55,840
far my my pussy would be ad nauseam yep

689
00:43:55,840 --> 00:44:00,620
and also it would have said that like you were on it.

690
00:44:00,620 --> 00:44:08,820
Would you guys if you had a if you guys had a pussy, would you say it like that?

691
00:44:08,820 --> 00:44:16,200
Would you get the two lips on either side? Would you get them tattooed with a

692
00:44:16,200 --> 00:44:20,440
company for a monthly fee, I get like wrapping a sedan yeah? I guess I would do

693
00:44:20,460 --> 00:44:23,380
I'd pin them open like a butterfly.

694
00:44:23,380 --> 00:44:32,620
For $20,000, I would get the Carl's Jr. logo on my mons pubis.

695
00:44:32,620 --> 00:44:33,620
Can I tell you guys something about...

696
00:44:33,620 --> 00:44:34,620
No, no, it's got to be on the lips.

697
00:44:34,620 --> 00:44:35,620
No, no, no.

698
00:44:35,620 --> 00:44:38,940
It's right like, but like too close.

699
00:44:38,940 --> 00:44:39,940
Okay.

700
00:44:39,940 --> 00:44:40,940
Sure.

701
00:44:40,940 --> 00:44:42,980
Like part of the star is kind of going in.

702
00:44:42,980 --> 00:44:43,980
Yeah.

703
00:44:43,980 --> 00:44:48,860
My girlfriend got a tattoo from this lady who spider webbed a girl's butthole.

704
00:44:48,860 --> 00:44:50,460
I've seen, I've heard of that.

705
00:44:50,460 --> 00:44:51,460
Wow.

706
00:44:51,460 --> 00:44:52,460
Yeah.

707
00:44:52,460 --> 00:44:55,220
Can I tell you guys something about Carl's Jr. that I forgot to tell you guys from Mexico?

708
00:44:55,220 --> 00:44:56,220
Yes.

709
00:44:56,220 --> 00:44:58,060
They had a Carl's Jr. near our hotel.

710
00:44:58,060 --> 00:45:01,900
I thought it was very funny because they had all the Mexican food and they just had a Carl's

711
00:45:01,900 --> 00:45:07,700
Jr. and it had a big, a big glass window so you could see like the whole, you could see

712
00:45:07,700 --> 00:45:11,340
the counter and like the menu and everything up on the screen.

713
00:45:11,340 --> 00:45:14,980
And one night we were walking back to our hotel and there were two guys who were like

714
00:45:14,980 --> 00:45:18,160
clearly a little drunk but there was like two American guys who were just standing outside

715
00:45:18,160 --> 00:45:21,960
said the carls junior and just standing like right next to each other and just

716
00:45:21,960 --> 00:45:27,360
just staring into the window at the menu and standing completely still and

717
00:45:27,360 --> 00:45:30,040
they're like their girlfriends are like come on come on and they're just

718
00:45:30,040 --> 00:45:33,880
sitting there staring and we're laughing so hard at it and then a third

719
00:45:33,880 --> 00:45:37,540
guy who clearly did not know them came up and stood next to them. It started

720
00:45:37,540 --> 00:45:37,900
to

721
00:45:37,900 --> 00:45:43,400
just looking at the menu like a like a cat staring out the window

722
00:45:45,040 --> 00:45:47,040
Speaking of Carl's Jr.

723
00:45:47,040 --> 00:45:50,540
Our college girlfriends took us to Mexico and now we're so sad.

724
00:45:50,540 --> 00:45:53,040
Now we're mothed to a flame at Carl's Jr.

725
00:45:53,040 --> 00:45:55,540
The menu is probably different.

726
00:45:55,540 --> 00:45:57,540
It's all the same.

727
00:45:57,540 --> 00:46:01,540
Well, okay. Speaking of the butthole tattoo,

728
00:46:01,540 --> 00:46:06,040
I don't know, like, that person got their butthole spider webbed, right?

729
00:46:06,040 --> 00:46:11,040
For $50,000,

730
00:46:11,040 --> 00:46:15,360
I would get the Carl's Jr. logo on my butt.

731
00:46:15,360 --> 00:46:18,040
The mouth is the...

732
00:46:18,040 --> 00:46:20,040
I like the girl with the octopus ass.

733
00:46:20,040 --> 00:46:24,040
I mean, yeah, the thing about that is that, I mean, I don't...

734
00:46:24,040 --> 00:46:28,040
It's just... At that point, it's like how much money would you pay to suffer this pain?

735
00:46:28,040 --> 00:46:32,040
Because I don't know how many people are going to be looking at my butthole and being like,

736
00:46:32,040 --> 00:46:36,040
"I'm seeing your butthole and I can't believe there's Carl's Jr. on it. What's wrong with you?"

737
00:46:36,040 --> 00:46:38,040
That person that got a spider web in his butthole.

738
00:46:38,040 --> 00:46:42,440
I mean maybe five to six people Maxel see my Carl's Jr. But you cannot get this

739
00:46:42,440 --> 00:46:42,840
job

740
00:46:42,840 --> 00:46:46,760
but

741
00:46:46,760 --> 00:46:46,960
I

742
00:46:46,960 --> 00:46:50,560
am I ever going to get a job now, but you have an as you would be able to get

743
00:46:50,560 --> 00:46:53,480
the job of Carl's Jr. Though that's true yeah, that's a

744
00:46:53,480 --> 00:46:57,880
bad job. Yeah, let me show you. Let me show you by the way that's a birthmark

745
00:46:57,880 --> 00:46:59,960
yeah, that's what I would say my the

746
00:46:59,960 --> 00:47:03,200
lady or the person who got the

747
00:47:03,200 --> 00:47:08,000
spider web but whole. I saw an interview with them where they're like every

748
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:14,000
time I went to the bathroom, I had to put Vaseline and every single time that

749
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:17,440
they went to the bathroom, they had to do after care. That surprises you? Of

750
00:47:17,440 --> 00:47:24,260
course. You can't get poop on a tattoo. Imagine the commitment to a spider web

751
00:47:24,260 --> 00:47:30,640
butthole is something that I could not do. For $50,000? For 50 Gs? Easily. For

752
00:47:30,640 --> 00:47:34,460
some spider web paint on your butt and then you gotta wash your ass for three

753
00:47:34,460 --> 00:47:38,060
basically yeah, basically two weeks of washing my ass every day to wipe my

754
00:47:38,060 --> 00:47:38,620
butt after

755
00:47:38,620 --> 00:47:40,900
I would not

756
00:47:40,900 --> 00:47:46,260
sit down after thousand sitting down after getting that

757
00:47:46,260 --> 00:47:51,900
I'll go to the hospital for two weeks every day. I'll hire somebody to be my

758
00:47:51,900 --> 00:47:54,980
personal nurse and give him five grand and then I told forty five thousand

759
00:47:54,980 --> 00:47:58,180
dollars a good idea. I shouldn't hire somebody to wipe my eyes. I shouldn't

760
00:47:58,180 --> 00:48:01,980
have talked about this person spider web butthole tattoo this much, but my

761
00:48:01,980 --> 00:48:05,780
my girlfriend kept showing me it and she was like isn't this so cool. I was

762
00:48:05,780 --> 00:48:09,940
he said it was cool. I was like if you get that I I'm putting spiders in your

763
00:48:09,940 --> 00:48:14,140
yeah, I put you got to yeah, I walked a walk. I'm putting spiders in your butt.

764
00:48:14,140 --> 00:48:17,220
You are getting spiders in your butt. I'm going to put random. I'm going to

765
00:48:17,220 --> 00:48:21,620
put flies in there and you have to catch them in the way. If I saw a girl

766
00:48:21,620 --> 00:48:24,380
with a spider web, but that you'll be like oh my God, this this but hasn't

767
00:48:24,380 --> 00:48:25,460
been used in years.

768
00:48:27,540 --> 00:48:29,540
Oh God, getting a broom.

769
00:48:29,540 --> 00:48:33,540
I know why I talked about that spider web butthole tattoo so much.

770
00:48:33,540 --> 00:48:35,540
That was funny.

771
00:48:35,540 --> 00:48:37,540
It was funny. It was fine.

772
00:48:37,540 --> 00:48:39,540
Do we have a list today? We're supposed to do a list.

773
00:48:39,540 --> 00:48:41,540
No, writer's strike.

774
00:48:41,540 --> 00:48:43,540
That'll be our excuse today. Mostly it's no wifi.

775
00:48:43,540 --> 00:48:45,540
No wifi so we can't really do anything like that.

776
00:48:45,540 --> 00:48:49,540
They have not messaged me back about the wifi.

777
00:48:49,540 --> 00:48:51,540
Didn't you say you scheduled it? Why would they message you again?

778
00:48:51,540 --> 00:48:53,540
I gotta create an account.

779
00:48:53,540 --> 00:48:55,540
So you didn't do it?

780
00:48:55,540 --> 00:48:59,940
couldn't do it and I'm going to make the password very funny. I know you will.

781
00:48:59,940 --> 00:49:06,100
I'm going to hate the password. It's going to be shiz or piss. It's not going to be shiz or piss or tits.

782
00:49:06,100 --> 00:49:07,060
It'll be pez.

783
00:49:07,060 --> 00:49:11,900
I think that... Can I tell you guys something very controversial? Yeah.

784
00:49:11,900 --> 00:49:16,140
Because I've been just thinking about candy a lot. We can't... I have candy on my mind.

785
00:49:16,140 --> 00:49:18,460
I don't really want to talk about candy. We've been talking about it a lot.

786
00:49:18,460 --> 00:49:20,980
But I do want to say one thing.

787
00:49:22,100 --> 00:49:27,200
I think that Pez is in my top five candies. I like Pez. Cherry Pez. Is

788
00:49:27,200 --> 00:49:31,080
that not? I feel like people, people should be crucified. No, that's that's

789
00:49:31,080 --> 00:49:34,180
fine. I love Pez. Pez is the same as Smarties. If it comes out of this,

790
00:49:34,180 --> 00:49:38,420
I mean, one at a time, and I'm enjoying them so much. Pez is better and

791
00:49:38,420 --> 00:49:41,220
different than Smarties. Yeah, but it's the same class of... It's the same

792
00:49:41,220 --> 00:49:43,920
class. It's like it's an insane candy to eat. There's also something about,

793
00:49:43,920 --> 00:49:47,640
it's like how wine is better if it's decanted. There's something about Pez

794
00:49:47,640 --> 00:49:50,300
out of the package, I don't really want it. If it comes out of Fred Flintstone's

795
00:49:50,300 --> 00:49:56,300
neck. That's good. That's a good candy. It's the plastic in the Pez. It adds flavor.

796
00:49:56,300 --> 00:50:00,500
Oh my God. It's also because you've got to work for it. That's true. Because it's

797
00:50:00,500 --> 00:50:08,420
hard for a weakling like me, a wimp, it's hard as fuck. For me, I'm kind of a

798
00:50:08,420 --> 00:50:13,860
cynical, ironical type of guy, so I don't often give many thumbs up. So my thumbs

799
00:50:13,860 --> 00:50:17,300
are kind of atrophied because I sit there like this all the time. Also, I watch

800
00:50:17,300 --> 00:50:21,240
got a TV and I go, that's the closest I'll ever get to loading a magazine of

801
00:50:21,240 --> 00:50:26,220
a gun is putting the fucking Pez things in. And I feel like I really do feel

802
00:50:26,220 --> 00:50:29,980
like a tough guy when I put the Pez things in. Yeah. 'Cause it's the exact

803
00:50:29,980 --> 00:50:30,240
same

804
00:50:30,240 --> 00:50:31,620
thing.

805
00:50:31,620 --> 00:50:33,660
And then hearing it go like,

806
00:50:33,660 --> 00:50:36,080
"I love that." Yeah, wow.

807
00:50:36,080 --> 00:50:39,460
But I would love it. For me, that's what I get from plugging a damn XLR cable

808
00:50:39,460 --> 00:50:44,900
in. There is some way to load up Pez where you can just put the paper thing

809
00:50:44,900 --> 00:50:49,500
in there and then like I guess you shoot it down. I want the guys over the paper

810
00:50:49,500 --> 00:50:54,060
comes out the bottom. I think that's how you're supposed to load up Pez. I'm not

811
00:50:54,060 --> 00:51:00,780
entirely sure, but if that isn't true, then it should be Pez. Get your dumb ass

812
00:51:00,780 --> 00:51:07,380
German fucking asses on this. I really want the guys over at the modern warfare

813
00:51:07,380 --> 00:51:13,900
like reloading animation guys to do a Pez one. That'd be the guy who does the

814
00:51:14,540 --> 00:51:18,380
real life staplers and stuff. Yeah, he needs to do. I think he did. Maybe that's

815
00:51:18,380 --> 00:51:22,860
what I'm thinking. Maybe I saw that video of that guy loading up. You mother

816
00:51:22,860 --> 00:51:27,140
fucker. Yeah, oddly satisfying. It is seriously oddly satisfying. Strange

817
00:51:27,140 --> 00:51:29,860
words. Well, that was kind of perfect.

818
00:51:29,860 --> 00:51:33,900
I think that this studio could be used for all. I think that we could

819
00:51:33,900 --> 00:51:38,860
definitely do art in here. I think we could do squidward voice acting. We

820
00:51:38,860 --> 00:51:43,140
could do squidward. We could do paintings. Uh huh. We could do squidward

821
00:51:43,140 --> 00:51:46,180
voice acting classes. I don't think that that would be very good. We could get

822
00:51:46,180 --> 00:51:49,180
that guy who just walked by to come in here and we'll try to teach him.

823
00:51:49,180 --> 00:51:52,780
We could teach that guy how to talk like Squidward.

824
00:51:52,780 --> 00:51:56,740
Or I guess more Squilliam. I think we could do Squilliam for sure, but

825
00:51:56,740 --> 00:52:00,260
Squidward is hard. Should we just leave that door unlocked and just and have like

826
00:52:00,260 --> 00:52:04,820
people walk in? Yeah. Actually just let people come in here if they want?

827
00:52:04,820 --> 00:52:08,660
No, because then people will find out the address and then like people will try to

828
00:52:08,660 --> 00:52:12,180
come in, which isn't as fun. I don't think so. It's not fun if you know who we are.

829
00:52:12,180 --> 00:52:18,140
I don't think anybody has the time to go look at a studio. You know what we should do? We

830
00:52:18,140 --> 00:52:19,140
should charge for tours.

831
00:52:19,140 --> 00:52:20,140
That's a good idea.

832
00:52:20,140 --> 00:52:21,140
That's a great idea.

833
00:52:21,140 --> 00:52:22,140
That's a really good idea.

834
00:52:22,140 --> 00:52:23,140
There used to be...

835
00:52:23,140 --> 00:52:26,740
We should put down rails and have a little car, like a...

836
00:52:26,740 --> 00:52:30,420
Oh my God, we get mannequins of us on the set.

837
00:52:30,420 --> 00:52:34,300
I went to a podcast studio tour when I was like 15, on that same trip that we changed

838
00:52:34,300 --> 00:52:35,300
my brother's diaper.

839
00:52:35,300 --> 00:52:36,300
A podcast studio.

840
00:52:36,300 --> 00:52:37,300
It was...

841
00:52:37,300 --> 00:52:38,300
Earwolf?

842
00:52:38,300 --> 00:52:40,420
It's way worse. It was a

843
00:52:40,420 --> 00:52:48,420
Tech news today Leo Laporte. Okay. It was this guy who was like this you were a weird-ass kid

844
00:52:48,420 --> 00:52:50,940
Yeah, I really was he was this guy who did like

845
00:52:50,940 --> 00:52:54,060
technology reviews and stuff and he

846
00:52:54,060 --> 00:53:01,860
Had a podcast studio. I think it was called TWI this week in tech was his big show. It's

847
00:53:04,700 --> 00:53:09,300
And we went and we like scheduled a tour because I really wanted to and it was

848
00:53:09,300 --> 00:53:13,300
they're free and we you go and you just like sit there while they do the show

849
00:53:13,300 --> 00:53:17,100
and I was like blackout happy. I barely remember any of it.

850
00:53:17,100 --> 00:53:21,600
There was two. It was like the lady who I organized the blackout happy is so

851
00:53:21,600 --> 00:53:26,500
real. I know exactly what you mean being like a nerdy fucking like 14. I

852
00:53:26,500 --> 00:53:29,500
couldn't even believe it. I was just sitting there like wasn't even able to

853
00:53:29,500 --> 00:53:34,100
enjoy it. Seeing a band that I listened to on iTunes for seven years. Exactly.

854
00:53:34,100 --> 00:53:39,380
life just not yeah, I just fully unable to even react and I met the guy Leo

855
00:53:39,380 --> 00:53:42,340
Laporte and he was he had his voice and I think I went like

856
00:53:42,340 --> 00:53:48,460
like some kind of a noise when I saw him and then I and then like the week

857
00:53:48,460 --> 00:53:54,140
after we did this tour, it came out that he was cheating on his wife with the

858
00:53:54,140 --> 00:53:59,540
the lady who I booked the tour with like the the the intern that I was like

859
00:53:59,540 --> 00:54:03,780
emailing and he the way that people found out was he like open. He was like

860
00:54:03,820 --> 00:54:07,320
reviewing a phone and like a samsung galaxy or whatever, and it was it was

861
00:54:07,320 --> 00:54:10,720
like a live show and it was showing the phone and he was like so let's take a

862
00:54:10,720 --> 00:54:13,520
look at the photos at he opens it up and it's just like a photo of her ass.

863
00:54:13,520 --> 00:54:19,840
And so then I was like this guy's a scumbag and I never listened to him

864
00:54:19,840 --> 00:54:25,380
again. Yeah, I got my I got my enjoyment and when I when I could good work, but

865
00:54:25,380 --> 00:54:27,940
we should do stuff like that yeah for sure for sure. We should have people

866
00:54:27,940 --> 00:54:30,640
come and they can sit. We should review tech as well. Yeah,

867
00:54:30,640 --> 00:54:32,680
I think we should

868
00:54:32,680 --> 00:54:37,840
I feel like I should get some compromising nude photos of you soon.

869
00:54:37,840 --> 00:54:38,840
Why?

870
00:54:38,840 --> 00:54:39,840
Just to have.

871
00:54:39,840 --> 00:54:40,840
I want a Manila envelope.

872
00:54:40,840 --> 00:54:41,840
I don't want them on my phone.

873
00:54:41,840 --> 00:54:42,840
I want them nude.

874
00:54:42,840 --> 00:54:47,840
I want a panel in my house that I can unseal.

875
00:54:47,840 --> 00:54:48,840
This is kind of smart.

876
00:54:48,840 --> 00:54:51,840
I'm not that nude that often.

877
00:54:51,840 --> 00:54:55,840
Well, that's why I think I'm probably nude.

878
00:54:55,840 --> 00:54:56,840
You're nude the most.

879
00:54:56,840 --> 00:54:57,840
I think I'm nude maybe.

880
00:54:57,840 --> 00:54:58,840
I'm definitely nude the most.

881
00:54:58,840 --> 00:54:59,840
You're probably nude the most.

882
00:54:59,840 --> 00:55:00,840
I'm nude maybe.

883
00:55:00,840 --> 00:55:01,840
I'm nude all day.

884
00:55:01,840 --> 00:55:05,080
if there was like a pie chart of my day, I think the smallest liver would be

885
00:55:05,080 --> 00:55:08,920
being nude. Yeah, I'm not nude very often, but I am. I am. The biggest

886
00:55:08,920 --> 00:55:12,760
liver would be big on this guy. You are big on these. I like to be in

887
00:55:12,760 --> 00:55:17,880
my own. That yeah, that I think maybe I think okay, okay, you know what?

888
00:55:17,880 --> 00:55:20,800
I'm pie chart of the day pie chart of the day. 12%

889
00:55:20,800 --> 00:55:23,480
mate or 10% nude,

890
00:55:23,480 --> 00:55:29,400
maybe 50%. I wish I lived one more. I would be. I would be. I think

891
00:55:29,400 --> 00:55:33,440
I'll be a walking around new guy. If I would if I would live, I here's here's

892
00:55:33,440 --> 00:55:38,940
the breakdown of my my clothes situation. Okay, the least I ever am probably is

893
00:55:38,940 --> 00:55:44,520
just underwear on yeah. The second least is probably completely nude and again

894
00:55:44,520 --> 00:55:48,220
that's probably still twelve percent of my day yeah and then clothes is

895
00:55:48,220 --> 00:55:54,160
obviously my number one, but the one in between nude and clothed is completely

896
00:55:54,160 --> 00:55:55,220
naked, but big

897
00:55:58,760 --> 00:56:03,060
I didn't mean to start doing this literally like a girl, like a girl

898
00:56:03,060 --> 00:56:07,400
thing. I read a guy's house. I wear a big T. It's called Pooh Baron. I have

899
00:56:07,400 --> 00:56:11,480
I go Pooh Bear. So I do that the second I get if I'm the second that I

900
00:56:11,480 --> 00:56:15,420
get home always, if I'm not out or people aren't over, I always just take

901
00:56:15,420 --> 00:56:18,640
off my pants and I'm shirt and underwear. No, I go no underwear. My

902
00:56:18,640 --> 00:56:21,780
dick is hanging below my think if I was if I lived higher up, though,

903
00:56:21,780 --> 00:56:24,820
that's what I would be doing. That's got to be the worst possible look

904
00:56:24,840 --> 00:56:28,820
that underwear is so it's got to be the worst look ever. It's making me laugh so

905
00:56:28,820 --> 00:56:32,600
much. I do that. I go full either full on just underwear or shirt and underwear

906
00:56:32,600 --> 00:56:34,980
and I just sit on my couch for five hours on my

907
00:56:34,980 --> 00:56:40,540
men. I'm shirt and underwear all the time, but I've my problem is is my I've

908
00:56:40,540 --> 00:56:45,720
fucking bay windows yeah in my house, so everyone in my neighborhood can see that

909
00:56:45,720 --> 00:56:50,400
I'm walking around my house either like just underwear on or like I stand it's

910
00:56:50,400 --> 00:56:54,100
like I stand I stand. I look out the window and I stand at the window and

911
00:56:54,140 --> 00:56:57,580
you know, you know that I look at people walking. I'm sitting on my bay window

912
00:56:57,580 --> 00:57:00,720
and I'm looking out the window for Lorne. That's exactly that's literally

913
00:57:00,720 --> 00:57:04,340
exactly looking. I go, I go on my underwear, I sit on the computer, I go

914
00:57:04,340 --> 00:57:07,640
in your underwear, my video games and then I get up. I look out the window

915
00:57:07,640 --> 00:57:10,640
and I stare that stand there and only my under when I look at all the families

916
00:57:10,640 --> 00:57:11,760
walk by. I just

917
00:57:11,760 --> 00:57:19,680
I literally I am in the most compromising if if somebody was hired to

918
00:57:19,680 --> 00:57:23,160
get blackmail photos of me, it would take them about thirty fucking minutes,

919
00:57:23,420 --> 00:57:29,800
because I get home and I'm I will watch TV sometimes and be like I need to

920
00:57:29,800 --> 00:57:33,560
stretch my back out and this is the situation is this. My lower back is

921
00:57:33,560 --> 00:57:37,780
hurting because of the gym, so I'll get on my couch. My head is sideways

922
00:57:37,780 --> 00:57:42,440
watching the TV. My head is in the in the on the thing and my ass is poked up

923
00:57:42,440 --> 00:57:48,880
and I have no pants on no underwear on just a t shirt. So I'm mooning and one

924
00:57:48,880 --> 00:57:53,400
side of my couch moons the fucking the window and then, if I so if I do it that

925
00:57:53,400 --> 00:57:56,460
that way. People are looking my asshole, my balls, but if I do it the other way,

926
00:57:56,460 --> 00:58:02,300
it looks like I'm waiting for a ghost of fuck me. I have the worst. I like a

927
00:58:02,300 --> 00:58:05,840
ring, a ring video camera installed in my house would ruin my life. Oh yeah,

928
00:58:05,840 --> 00:58:08,500
even if I was the only person ever saw the footage, I'd probably kill myself

929
00:58:08,500 --> 00:58:12,780
yeah because I'm just walking around with like a baby penis and balls hanging

930
00:58:12,780 --> 00:58:16,640
below my shirt and sometimes I dance. Oh yeah, that's the other thing I'm doing

931
00:58:16,640 --> 00:58:20,720
the dishes. I'm listening to the kid, Roy, shaking my penis

932
00:58:22,920 --> 00:58:27,640
dancing in my underwear to my music. It sucks having like two roommates.

933
00:58:27,640 --> 00:58:32,480
Yeah. Cause then it's like, I'll be at home doing that. And then I fucking,

934
00:58:32,480 --> 00:58:35,840
you know, one of them come home, comes home from work and then it's like, Oh

935
00:58:35,840 --> 00:58:39,720
man, I gotta like get up, go to my room and put like pants on at least. Yeah. I

936
00:58:39,720 --> 00:58:44,160
can't like, I can't, that's not an alpha move. That's just an uncomfortable,

937
00:58:44,160 --> 00:58:50,200
I used to watch of Barry. When I lived with Neil, I would, there was a lot of

938
00:58:50,200 --> 00:58:54,500
sometimes where I would try to get from the bathroom to my room and back

939
00:58:54,500 --> 00:58:59,080
completely naked. Yeah, yeah, because I would just either it'd be late at night.

940
00:58:59,080 --> 00:59:02,800
I didn't want to put on clothes and I piss or I would be getting out of the

941
00:59:02,800 --> 00:59:06,440
shower and not want to put on my dirty clothes. Yeah, you were close enough to

942
00:59:06,440 --> 00:59:09,620
the bathroom where that is like barely a challenge. Yeah, it was it was right

943
00:59:09,620 --> 00:59:11,420
across the hall. It was like, but I know you were going like

944
00:59:16,080 --> 00:59:18,180
running into people's rooms, I'm all oiled up

945
00:59:18,180 --> 00:59:20,680
and down the thing

946
00:59:20,680 --> 00:59:26,680
speaking of being half nude. Is your girlfriend ever? I'm not talking. I

947
00:59:26,680 --> 00:59:29,840
first of all, I don't have a girlfriend. Yeah, that's true. You guys are both

948
00:59:29,840 --> 00:59:32,480
me neither fiance or you have a wife. Yeah,

949
00:59:32,480 --> 00:59:38,280
well, does yours does your significant other ever complain? Is your life

950
00:59:38,280 --> 00:59:43,480
partner ever complain that you are just casually playing with your balls too

951
00:59:43,480 --> 00:59:43,820
much?

952
00:59:45,360 --> 00:59:48,560
No, because it means that she it means I'm covering them with my hand. So

953
00:59:48,560 --> 00:59:51,320
just like, you know, just scratching them and just like play with them all

954
00:59:51,320 --> 00:59:52,680
the time in public to yeah.

955
00:59:52,680 --> 00:59:54,240
I will say

956
00:59:54,240 --> 00:59:59,160
I can tell that you are on YouTube and then just like scratching them. I

957
00:59:59,160 --> 01:00:04,120
mean, I know that you are in the top 1% of people who play their with their

958
01:00:04,120 --> 01:00:08,920
balls. Yeah, I can do it more than most men do because I see you do it

959
01:00:08,920 --> 01:00:12,280
all the time. Yeah, yeah, I'm always doing this. Yeah, you're always doing

960
01:00:12,280 --> 01:00:13,480
You love scratching them.

961
01:00:13,480 --> 01:00:15,480
It's hairy down there.

962
01:00:15,480 --> 01:00:16,480
You need to shave.

963
01:00:16,480 --> 01:00:17,480
You don't shave at all.

964
01:00:17,480 --> 01:00:18,480
No.

965
01:00:18,480 --> 01:00:19,480
Man, you need to.

966
01:00:19,480 --> 01:00:20,480
I gotta.

967
01:00:20,480 --> 01:00:21,480
You need to start.

968
01:00:21,480 --> 01:00:22,480
At least trim them.

969
01:00:22,480 --> 01:00:23,480
I gotta do something.

970
01:00:23,480 --> 01:00:24,480
I'm not saying you gotta shave them completely clean.

971
01:00:24,480 --> 01:00:25,480
I'm saying you have to shave them completely clean.

972
01:00:25,480 --> 01:00:27,480
I gotta get that manscape thing.

973
01:00:27,480 --> 01:00:31,480
No, no, you use your wife's trimmers that she uses on her mustache.

974
01:00:31,480 --> 01:00:32,480
She doesn't have those.

975
01:00:32,480 --> 01:00:33,480
Oh.

976
01:00:33,480 --> 01:00:38,480
And I broke, she got me like a beard trimmer for our anniversary, I think.

977
01:00:38,480 --> 01:00:40,480
You broke it on your own nuts?

978
01:00:40,480 --> 01:00:43,480
I literally broke it trying to shave my nuts.

979
01:00:43,480 --> 01:00:44,480
Whoa.

980
01:00:44,480 --> 01:00:45,480
Well, you just don't know the technique.

981
01:00:45,480 --> 01:00:46,480
The motor just stopped working.

982
01:00:46,480 --> 01:00:50,480
Here's the technique for all y'all with balls.

983
01:00:50,480 --> 01:00:56,480
The technique is you basically make little dreadlocks with the hairs on your nuts, and

984
01:00:56,480 --> 01:00:57,480
then you snip it with scissors.

985
01:00:57,480 --> 01:00:58,480
Yeah, but my hair is too thick.

986
01:00:58,480 --> 01:00:59,480
You don't need a trimmer.

987
01:00:59,480 --> 01:01:00,480
My hair is too thick down there.

988
01:01:00,480 --> 01:01:01,480
That doesn't make any fucking sense, motherfucker.

989
01:01:01,480 --> 01:01:02,480
It's too thick all over.

990
01:01:02,480 --> 01:01:03,480
You can't be cut by scissors.

991
01:01:03,480 --> 01:01:04,480
You got a thick-ass hair.

992
01:01:04,480 --> 01:01:05,480
I know.

993
01:01:05,480 --> 01:01:06,480
Is that what you're saying?

994
01:01:06,480 --> 01:01:07,480
No, I need to get down there with like a machete.

995
01:01:07,480 --> 01:01:08,480
A katana.

996
01:01:08,480 --> 01:01:13,480
Katana flying here. You all fly alert. Oh my God, it reminds me of breaking bad

997
01:01:13,480 --> 01:01:17,080
episode. Wait, check us out where that episode does what

998
01:01:17,080 --> 01:01:22,380
that sucked. You can't do shit like that in this new place. He's been he's been

999
01:01:22,380 --> 01:01:26,980
throwing and knocking and he's been the nice a new office. We upgrade from the

1000
01:01:26,980 --> 01:01:30,680
basement. That's completely fully flooded and then walk in and you start

1001
01:01:30,680 --> 01:01:33,880
throwing stuff. You're knocking stuff over. I'm knocking stuff over. Whatever

1002
01:01:33,880 --> 01:01:41,080
louder than average. I am excited, but I mean think like when we left that basement space,

1003
01:01:41,080 --> 01:01:47,240
can we say the address? Sure. 133 Menehan Street. Usually, why do you want to say the

1004
01:01:47,240 --> 01:01:52,520
address? Why do you care? Just for fans who walk by and then think, man, that's where

1005
01:01:52,520 --> 01:01:56,680
they used to have the office. The old set might still be sitting out front. It probably

1006
01:01:56,680 --> 01:02:00,840
is. If you want to go get it. If you want to go take pieces like it's the Berlin Wall.

1007
01:02:00,840 --> 01:02:01,340
yeah

1008
01:02:01,340 --> 01:02:05,880
we left something Caleb said the other day. You say that the yeah, not letting

1009
01:02:05,880 --> 01:02:08,840
it slide. Yeah, you stole it. I stole it.

1010
01:02:08,840 --> 01:02:16,080
That's right, karma for stealing my my comparison. Yeah, you're witty line, my

1011
01:02:16,080 --> 01:02:16,760
witty line.

1012
01:02:16,760 --> 01:02:26,320
That place was so flooded. There was dirt all over and I mean we're probably

1013
01:02:26,320 --> 01:02:30,600
not getting the security deposit, but they try to blame us for that flood. I'm

1014
01:02:30,680 --> 01:02:34,380
going to be based you're going to yeah, because you had to clean up all that

1015
01:02:34,380 --> 01:02:35,200
stuff. I

1016
01:02:35,200 --> 01:02:39,420
was star of the day. You are not star that you are not sorry. The day I was

1017
01:02:39,420 --> 01:02:43,120
started, I thought it was so funny the day after the day, the first day when it

1018
01:02:43,120 --> 01:02:47,200
flooded really bad and when I would say me and Caleb, it was honestly pretty much

1019
01:02:47,200 --> 01:02:51,120
just Caleb fixed the flood. Yeah, the first one. Yeah, the first one in you

1020
01:02:51,120 --> 01:02:55,480
were full MVP. I went and then and then Pat getting in like like four or five

1021
01:02:55,480 --> 01:02:59,640
hours after we got in and then I like and he because he was a brunch. I get

1022
01:02:59,680 --> 01:03:02,420
someone see to it like the fucking office flooded

1023
01:03:02,420 --> 01:03:06,300
he got there after we fixed

1024
01:03:06,300 --> 01:03:10,800
so funny

1025
01:03:10,800 --> 01:03:15,480
yeah, because I had to I had to like I was cleaning up everything, but then I

1026
01:03:15,480 --> 01:03:19,600
was like I would try to move my desk or whatever like yeah, it was more something

1027
01:03:19,600 --> 01:03:25,600
and my where my computer was was where it all puddled yeah, so I had a little

1028
01:03:25,680 --> 01:03:29,960
that I had to deal with. It pisses me off when people complain so badly I've

1029
01:03:29,960 --> 01:03:34,440
realized. Yeah. Yeah if people complain about pretty much anything I get so mad.

1030
01:03:34,440 --> 01:03:44,880
It's incredible that we're friends. I love to complain so much. I know. Nothing makes me happier. That's the only thing I don't like about you two. I love bitching and moaning. It's so fun.

1031
01:03:44,880 --> 01:03:50,720
It's the best thing in the world. You two really love it. I despise complaining about my

1032
01:03:50,720 --> 01:03:56,480
my scenario. I love complaining about other things so much. My girlfriend hates it. I

1033
01:03:56,480 --> 01:04:03,200
also have it to the point where I despise it so much that I will like accept awful service

1034
01:04:03,200 --> 01:04:07,040
always. Yeah. Awful food. Because you don't want to complain. I will never complain about

1035
01:04:07,040 --> 01:04:10,760
that until later. I've never sent anything back. I've never complained about anything

1036
01:04:10,760 --> 01:04:15,920
like that. I will - bad situations if I wait two hours at an office, I'm just like, "What

1037
01:04:15,920 --> 01:04:19,140
what are you going to do? I won't ask about it. If they forget my food, I

1038
01:04:19,140 --> 01:04:24,400
leave. I will leave before I ask about my food. I will not complain ever. I

1039
01:04:24,400 --> 01:04:29,280
complain about the best thing that ever happened to me. Cameron, that's why

1040
01:04:29,280 --> 01:04:32,080
you're good to have around, because I'll have you be the complainer for me. I

1041
01:04:32,080 --> 01:04:35,360
love to complain so much. And then Patrick will complain about weird stuff.

1042
01:04:35,360 --> 01:04:39,040
I just complain about the weirdest thing in the world. My favourite thing to do

1043
01:04:39,040 --> 01:04:41,800
is to complain. Patrick will go to that door and be like, "Well, it doesn't

1044
01:04:41,800 --> 01:04:45,560
open both ways." The way you complain, I feel like I'm a dedicated complainer,

1045
01:04:45,600 --> 01:04:50,140
the way you complain weirds me out. It throws me off the way I love playing

1046
01:04:50,140 --> 01:04:54,400
about weird. I like to complain about stuff that is not an like I as soon as

1047
01:04:54,400 --> 01:04:57,320
something is solved, I like to complain about it. I like to be like man that

1048
01:04:57,320 --> 01:05:00,960
fucking suck. That was so annoying to have to do that, but if it's I have to

1049
01:05:00,960 --> 01:05:04,240
complain to get through it, so I'm finding every single minute detail to

1050
01:05:04,240 --> 01:05:07,500
complain about and then I hate complaining during doing stuff that makes

1051
01:05:07,500 --> 01:05:10,400
me mad. I don't like that, but once something's over, I love complaining

1052
01:05:10,400 --> 01:05:13,280
about you know what it's like like if I like

1053
01:05:14,240 --> 01:05:18,260
if you like you ever seen like an older man, no working on something like one of

1054
01:05:18,260 --> 01:05:20,860
these older men who complain like do the same thing I do where they have to

1055
01:05:20,860 --> 01:05:22,980
complain to get through it yeah and they're just like

1056
01:05:22,980 --> 01:05:25,240
well, the fucking

1057
01:05:25,240 --> 01:05:30,260
yeah that's fun. I guess I'm only just now realizing that yeah, I can't stand.

1058
01:05:30,260 --> 01:05:34,040
I don't like that type of complaint, but I really like being like I had such a

1059
01:05:34,040 --> 01:05:37,900
long day. I had to do so much that or before it being like I'm about to have

1060
01:05:37,900 --> 01:05:43,860
to do so much. I really before during and after I really like I'm just a bitch.

1061
01:05:43,860 --> 01:05:52,260
That's true. I like convincing myself that I'm such a stoic hero that I don't

1062
01:05:52,260 --> 01:05:54,860
have to- You know we suffer more in our head than we do in reality.

1063
01:05:54,860 --> 01:05:58,780
Exactly. A lot of people see my smiling face and they think that I'm happy.

1064
01:05:58,780 --> 01:05:59,780
I gave up.

1065
01:05:59,780 --> 01:06:03,620
Buddy, I want to fucking kill myself every fucking second of my life.

1066
01:06:03,620 --> 01:06:07,740
I gave up on the stoic hero thing as soon as I started.

1067
01:06:07,740 --> 01:06:09,700
I've never seen you even be a little bit that.

1068
01:06:09,700 --> 01:06:10,100
No.

1069
01:06:10,100 --> 01:06:12,180
You were the least stoic person I think I've ever met.

1070
01:06:12,180 --> 01:06:16,780
I have to I have to say every single thought that I've ever had yeah, which is

1071
01:06:16,780 --> 01:06:22,460
okay. Yeah, you guys think I'm stoic. I think wait your bro lick brolic strong.

1072
01:06:22,460 --> 01:06:28,260
I think you look kind of stolen. Yep. Yeah, home lows. You look holic.

1073
01:06:28,260 --> 01:06:32,780
What is the way you look? You look solid. I don't think you're still like

1074
01:06:32,780 --> 01:06:35,780
I think you're heroic.

1075
01:06:35,780 --> 01:06:41,380
Okay, I got a p. Yeah, I mean, that's a wraps on this first time and guys we

1076
01:06:41,380 --> 01:06:47,100
We will have a set and we will have multiple cameras.

1077
01:06:47,100 --> 01:06:48,100
We don't have internet right now.

1078
01:06:48,100 --> 01:06:49,980
I do like that we set up the camera.

1079
01:06:49,980 --> 01:06:50,980
We set up the camera.

1080
01:06:50,980 --> 01:06:53,620
We had to show people how empty it is.

1081
01:06:53,620 --> 01:07:00,420
I mean the first thing that everyone sees is all of our fucking costumes and props.

1082
01:07:00,420 --> 01:07:01,940
And by the way that was we got rid of.

1083
01:07:01,940 --> 01:07:03,900
That's probably less than 25%.

1084
01:07:03,900 --> 01:07:05,460
That's way less.

1085
01:07:05,460 --> 01:07:06,460
That's less than 10% probably.

1086
01:07:06,460 --> 01:07:07,460
Has everyone seen?

1087
01:07:07,460 --> 01:07:09,060
You can stop it when you're done.

1088
01:07:09,060 --> 01:07:15,460
We can show, I don't think everyone's seen this from the live D&D show.

1089
01:07:15,460 --> 01:07:16,460
That's okay, we'll put a picture or something.

1090
01:07:16,460 --> 01:07:17,460
The big Sullivan?

1091
01:07:17,460 --> 01:07:18,460
Yeah.

1092
01:07:18,460 --> 01:07:19,460
I'm going to stop it.

1093
01:07:19,460 --> 01:07:20,460
All right.

1094
01:07:20,460 --> 01:07:21,460
Bye.

1095
01:07:21,460 --> 01:07:22,460
All right, goodbye.

1096
01:07:22,460 --> 01:07:27,820
You know what my favorite public prank at a place is?

1097
01:07:27,820 --> 01:07:31,460
My little prank that makes me laugh every time that's so dumb?

1098
01:07:31,460 --> 01:07:35,380
Is what if I go to a place and it's crowded, like a store or something, just really loudly

1099
01:07:35,380 --> 01:07:38,540
I say to whoever I'm with being like yeah, it's so sad that this place is

1100
01:07:38,540 --> 01:07:42,940
closing down. Yeah, I'm just glad we got to come here before it closes.

1101
01:07:42,940 --> 01:07:48,100
It's really what I'm saying for people to over here. Are you saying that at

1102
01:07:48,100 --> 01:07:53,000
like FAO Schwartz and Chris at like random stores? It really gets me.

1103
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:57,780
Every mom and pop store is only one employee. It's so sad they're

1104
01:07:57,780 --> 01:07:58,900
demolishing this place.

1105
01:07:58,900 --> 01:08:04,040
Man, just because I know it doesn't nobody. It doesn't mean anything to

1106
01:08:04,060 --> 01:08:06,060
It's not tricking anybody.

1107
01:08:06,060 --> 01:08:09,060
It's so sad what I'm going to do here next week.

1108
01:08:09,060 --> 01:08:11,060
That's so sad.

1109
01:08:11,060 --> 01:08:13,060
It's so sad what I have in this backpack.

1110
01:08:13,060 --> 01:08:16,060
It's so, so sad.

1111
01:08:16,060 --> 01:08:18,060
Oh man, I don't want to put it in the bathroom.

1112
01:08:18,060 --> 01:08:21,060
I don't want to put this backpack in the bathroom.

1113
01:08:21,060 --> 01:08:23,060
But I have to.

1114
01:08:23,060 --> 01:08:25,060
The voice is telling me to.
