00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:31,200
I'm not joking, I really hate when you guys do this.

17
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:32,680
- And there's a big but here.

18
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:34,560
He wishes he was.

19
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:35,400
- No.

20
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:38,920

23
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:42,960
- I hate when you guys do this

24
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:45,080
because then we get a million fans--

25
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:46,600
- You don't like being called a pedophile?

26
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:49,840
- In the discord making those jokes.

27
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:51,040
And I don't like it. - What joke?

28
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:52,040
- I don't like it. - It's not a joke, dude.

29
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:53,040
You're not a pedophile.

30
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:53,880
You think that's a joke?

31
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:54,720
Oh, is that a joke?

32
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:56,680
- No, no, you don't, no! - For me to say you're not one?

33
00:00:56,680 --> 00:00:58,480
- Fuck you, you know what you're doing.

34
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:01,480
I'm not doing anything. I don't know what I'm doing. I'm so stupid.

35
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:02,480
I'm sitting at my desk.

36
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:04,480
Yeah. I'm so stupid I have no idea what I'm doing.

37
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:07,480
Are you recording a podcast and making you a lot of money, Patrick? Is that what you hate us doing?

38
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:11,480
Did we even decide on the list? We were sending squeezy pictures to each other.

39
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:13,480
No, we did decide on the list.

40
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:14,480
Which one is it?

41
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:15,480
Don't spoil it!

42
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:16,480
Don't spoil the list.

43
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:17,480
Okay. Alright.

44
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:19,480
Just scroll up to the top of the chat. It's that easy.

45
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:20,480
It's the first one.

46
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:23,480
And don't read out loud because I know you like to do that.

47
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:28,480
Today, I went to the gym for the first time in like a month and a half.

48
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:34,920
And since then, it was about eight hours ago, since then, my balls have been completely receded

49
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:35,920
into my body.

50
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:36,920
And I don't know how to get them out.

51
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:38,160
That's a symptom of COVID.

52
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:39,160
I don't know.

53
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:40,680
I don't think so.

54
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:41,680
I don't think it's that.

55
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:44,000
I don't think that it's a symptom of COVID-19.

56
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
That's a COVID symptom.

57
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
It's not.

58
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
No.

59
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
No, it's not.

60
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
I think it's because I was lifting.

61
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,280
that's actually where the name COVID because it's good your your balls get

62
00:01:52,280 --> 00:02:01,080
COVID by your skin. They get COVID up. I they're always COVID by my skin. So you've

63
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:07,600
always had it? I mean I have ball sack skin yeah is that so crazy? I mean it's

64
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:16,280
not crazy just means you have it. I don't. That was so fucking stupid. I think it's my

65
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:20,120
body's way of like getting ready for battle. Yeah you have like it you have you

66
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:25,240
have a condition called tortoise penis. I do not have a tortoise's penis. I think

67
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:29,880
that my yeah I think it was like lifting heavyweights my my really heavyweights

68
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:37,280
we're talking like 80s, 89 pounds. 80 grams. 80 grams, 90 grams. In high school I tried to lift

69
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:42,560
I tried to lift the I tried to lift something I realized I couldn't even lift

70
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:48,360
the bar. That's pretty bad. Yeah, I know. That's pretty bad. Yeah. I had such a weak upper body.

71
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:52,960
I don't think I could do it now, honestly. On my walk home, I like noticed him in my body

72
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:58,600
and I was like, this would be a perfect time to be like attacked or mugged or something.

73
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:02,160
Could you imagine how scary it would be to kick someone in the balls and just keep walking

74
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:07,000
towards you? They're just like completely unfazed. Just advancing. Yeah, just like a

75
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:11,240
bullet bouncing off a Superman they're just like walking towards you so slowly

76
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:15,160
mm-hmm I don't know maybe I'll keep them up there maybe I'll tape maybe see if I

77
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:19,800
tape them up there that's why you should just wear a cup at all times no I don't

78
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:23,480
need any more accessories I already have my jewelry you should get you should oh

79
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:28,440
man you should get like cameo you know that they like the red codpiece the app

80
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:33,640
and do pick up my balls on it no no no no no cameo from the 80s it was like a

81
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:39,220
they sing that word up that's like "Oh pretty ladies around the world they got

82
00:03:39,220 --> 00:03:44,820
a weird thing" you know that song? No. Yeah. Well he's got the guy from cameo has

83
00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:48,740
like a red he wears like these leather pants and like a big red codpiece.

84
00:03:48,740 --> 00:03:53,260
It looks sick. Codpieces should come back in style. Yeah. Like a big like jewel

85
00:03:53,260 --> 00:03:58,500
encrusted like armor. What's a codpiece? Like it goes on your penis. I'll give you one guess

86
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:00,820
Caleb, based on what we're talking about.

87
00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:02,620
Is it a wiener holder?

88
00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:03,620
Yes.

89
00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:05,860
Is it some sort of sashay for your penis?

90
00:04:05,860 --> 00:04:06,860
It's like an armor cup.

91
00:04:06,860 --> 00:04:09,220
Wait, wait, look at this guy.

92
00:04:09,220 --> 00:04:12,260
Look at this picture of this guy.

93
00:04:12,260 --> 00:04:13,260
I don't want to look at this.

94
00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:15,700
No, you're gonna show me a man's wiener.

95
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:17,100
No, this is what we should get into.

96
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:18,580
Okay, that's actually beast mode.

97
00:04:18,580 --> 00:04:20,700
That guy looks so cool.

98
00:04:20,700 --> 00:04:22,580
I mean, he looks sick.

99
00:04:22,580 --> 00:04:25,140
He matched the hat to the codpiece.

100
00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:29,140
have to have a fucking powerful penis to have it locked right like that. Matching the hat

101
00:04:29,140 --> 00:04:31,940
to the codpiece is genius too because then a mugger is going to come up to you and go

102
00:04:31,940 --> 00:04:35,700
I should kick him in the balls and get confused and try and kick you in the head. Yeah it's

103
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:43,940
like a boss battle. It's a boss battle with two. It's like eye spots. Yeah. Yeah I guess

104
00:04:43,940 --> 00:04:48,580
you'd think that those would be your weak spots as a boss but not if that's a hardened

105
00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:54,220
ballsack holder. If I was a boss I would paint the strongest part of my body red. That's

106
00:04:54,220 --> 00:04:58,540
really good point actually yeah yeah then you've given you fool the hero yeah the

107
00:04:58,540 --> 00:05:03,380
hero that is fighting you you can you can fool them into hitting your kneecap or

108
00:05:03,380 --> 00:05:06,220
something what's the hardest like your penis yeah that's what you do you make

109
00:05:06,220 --> 00:05:10,500
your weenie red no no no getting hit in the elbow sucks not if they pinch it

110
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:14,900
compared to your to your glowing sacred heart yeah it's a thousand damage

111
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:19,100
heroes special attack is to pinch you yeah and so what you do is you have to

112
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:23,900
The hero's a crab. Yeah, you paint your penis.

113
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:25,900
The thing we haven't said is that the hero's a crab.

114
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:28,900
Go ahead, I'm invincible, see? Try my elbow.

115
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:31,900
And then he'll pinch you and go, "Fuck, I just give up, dude."

116
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:33,900
You can take her. I'm guessing that you have a...

117
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:35,900
It's a crab princess.

118
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:36,900
His crab wife.

119
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:40,900
You guys know that video of the crab cutting the crayfish in half?

120
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:42,900
Yeah, one of the best things of all time, yeah.

121
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:45,900
Probably the coolest video ever.

122
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:51,380
Yeah, I wish that there was a when I was a kid I believed in giant crabs because my brother told me that there were giant

123
00:05:51,380 --> 00:05:53,120
crabs in Japan

124
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:59,520
No, no, not like spider crabs. He told me that there were like like giant like Volkswagen beetle sized

125
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:06,420
Crabs that sometimes if you were swimming on the beach in Japan, they would walk up onto the shore and cut people in half. I

126
00:06:06,420 --> 00:06:11,700
Believe it. I did for a really long time. I also thought that

127
00:06:13,060 --> 00:06:18,300
Yeah, I also thought that Ron Jeremy and Tony Clifton were the same guy for a really long time.

128
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:20,140
Yeah, I wasn't a very smart kid.

129
00:06:20,140 --> 00:06:26,400
You know, it's weird you said that because you said it was a Green Room and I was watching that that's I don't know how

130
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:33,300
It came up in my recommendation. So I watched it the Bo Burnham on Green Room and Ron Jeremy's in the background. Yeah that clip

131
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:39,060
Yeah, and he's on then Tony Clifton is in a different one and I think he says the n-word and they kick him out

132
00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:44,740
yeah which is such a funny thing to do like that guy who's he's like trying to

133
00:06:44,740 --> 00:06:48,900
carry on an Andy Kaufman's legacy and he's like I'll go to the Bo Burnham

134
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:52,580
taping of Green Room right say the n-word and get kicked out that's gonna

135
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:55,500
be so epic dude that's such swag all comedy

136
00:06:55,500 --> 00:07:01,140
Bob Zmuda made like his entire autobiography about Andy is like mostly

137
00:07:01,140 --> 00:07:06,780
just like fabrications like it's just mostly like oh yeah actually we started

138
00:07:06,780 --> 00:07:11,020
wrestling women because we were horny yeah you know what I believe you know

139
00:07:11,020 --> 00:07:26,900
what actually that was he said that he like what's the fucking guys name I

140
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:30,900
don't know if it's David Mamet or somebody who wrote something like Bob's

141
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:35,540
Muta said he was like a script he worked with somebody and would record like his

142
00:07:35,540 --> 00:07:40,700
audio or audio to get dialogue for movies and it was just him going up to people

143
00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:46,020
and confronting them I don't I don't remember who it is but it's like a lot

144
00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:50,540
of that shit though yeah yeah he made up a ton of that shit like in the in the

145
00:07:50,540 --> 00:07:57,500
man on the moon movie when a when Andy goes to a fucking wherever and gets like

146
00:07:57,500 --> 00:08:02,660
crystal healing done on his cancer oh yeah that shit rules just making that up

147
00:08:02,660 --> 00:08:07,980
just being like yeah also he had he had a magic a magician do his cancer he went to

148
00:08:07,980 --> 00:08:12,460
Thailand to get magic cancer surgery yeah like I mean that would be cooler than

149
00:08:12,460 --> 00:08:15,780
pretty much anything Andy Kaufman ever did mm-hmm but I don't think he actually

150
00:08:15,780 --> 00:08:20,980
did it you guys don't think Andy Kaufman used magic at all I mean he was definitely

151
00:08:20,980 --> 00:08:26,740
a sorcerer so you're backpedaling now on this no he was a laugh so he yeah he I'm

152
00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:29,860
backpedaling yeah he was a sorcerer he was actually a real-life sorcerer yeah

153
00:08:29,860 --> 00:08:34,820
and he cast spells on all those women. He had to take locks of their hair to use in his cult.

154
00:08:34,820 --> 00:08:40,020
Exactly that's why he had to get so close to with wrestling that he stole their hair and

155
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:45,300
then he cloned them. Yep. Yep and that's how he also survived. And that's how women were created.

156
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:52,180
Yep and then he - by Andy Kaufman. His greatest prank. He uploaded his brain to Lisa Lampanelli

157
00:08:52,180 --> 00:08:59,540
and that's actually him. Yeah I was making myself laugh earlier uh I was like no one's home so I

158
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:01,140
So I was like you were tickling yourself.

159
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:02,140
I was tickling with yeah.

160
00:09:02,140 --> 00:09:09,060
No, I was thinking about Rod Serling just like introducing two girls one cup.

161
00:09:09,060 --> 00:09:11,820
Imagine a world.

162
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:17,620
Imagine if you will two women in a Brazilian in a Brazilian home making out on the couch

163
00:09:17,620 --> 00:09:21,000
when suddenly one of them stands up and squats over a cup.

164
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,140
What happens next will shock you.

165
00:09:23,140 --> 00:09:30,140
the Twilight Zone. Just like the whole thing.

166
00:09:30,140 --> 00:09:35,140
And also he like he stays in the frame for the entire

167
00:09:35,140 --> 00:09:39,140
of the thing. He's just smoking his lips in the corner.

168
00:09:39,140 --> 00:09:44,140
Jesus Christ. Oh Christ. I mean it's disgusting. I mean that's just wrong.

169
00:09:44,140 --> 00:09:49,140
But it happens in the Twilight Zone. A world where chocolate ice cream is not always as it seems.

170
00:09:49,140 --> 00:09:51,140
*laughter*

171
00:09:51,140 --> 00:09:53,140
*laughter*

172
00:09:53,140 --> 00:09:55,140
*laughter*

173
00:09:55,140 --> 00:09:57,140
Oh fuck.

174
00:09:57,140 --> 00:09:59,140
Just him in front of any of those shock videos

175
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:01,140
from 2008 is really good.

176
00:10:01,140 --> 00:10:03,140
Yeah.

177
00:10:03,140 --> 00:10:05,140
I love those shock videos.

178
00:10:05,140 --> 00:10:07,140
I may have said this before, but it's funny that they just went from like

179
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:09,140
the first shock videos were like

180
00:10:09,140 --> 00:10:11,140
people just having gay sex

181
00:10:11,140 --> 00:10:13,140
and then like a couple

182
00:10:13,140 --> 00:10:15,140
weeks later it was like people getting beheaded.

183
00:10:15,140 --> 00:10:17,140
Yeah.

184
00:10:17,140 --> 00:10:21,940
one guy and they were like these are the same thing these are so shocking.

185
00:10:21,940 --> 00:10:25,580
Right because it's a gamble you go through that the what was it lolshock.com you go

186
00:10:25,580 --> 00:10:30,420
through that website and it's like like walk the dinosaur was on there and walk

187
00:10:30,420 --> 00:10:35,980
the dinosaur is a 3d animation of two t-rex is 69ing and then like under that

188
00:10:35,980 --> 00:10:40,820
is like two guys one hammer which is just murder.

189
00:10:40,820 --> 00:10:46,420
yeah yeah I just be like oh fuck I don't want to watch these shocking videos oh

190
00:10:46,420 --> 00:10:51,980
the worst is like the what's that one where did she put the well there's tub

191
00:10:51,980 --> 00:10:56,340
girl but then there's the other one is I feel like the worst one is one guy one

192
00:10:56,340 --> 00:11:07,420
jar yeah which is that somewhere between gay sex and murder yeah it's both

193
00:11:07,420 --> 00:11:14,100
violent and somehow gay. There's just one guy. I forget how does the jar break in his ass?

194
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:19,980
Does he break it himself? I think he shoots it with a gun.

195
00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:22,980
He shoots the gun into his ass. Yosemite Sam style.

196
00:11:22,980 --> 00:11:26,980
Yo what in the blazes?

197
00:11:26,980 --> 00:11:33,580
Marmot! And he shoots himself in his ass and then the the tragically the glass

198
00:11:33,580 --> 00:11:40,980
explodes yeah and it cuts his asshole up what if he's an opera singer he has the

199
00:11:40,980 --> 00:11:49,860
jar in his ass and he just he had so much he was he was he had so much

200
00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:53,540
pleasure at the time that he had to he didn't know what to do other than moan

201
00:11:53,540 --> 00:11:57,820
opera that's yeah he's trying to hit the world's highest note did yeah well

202
00:11:57,820 --> 00:12:01,740
actually the real thing is that he he had been doing it with like like beer cans

203
00:12:01,740 --> 00:12:05,620
and stuff and he just had the strongest ass ever he was crumpling him up and then

204
00:12:05,620 --> 00:12:11,380
he just accidentally did it with the with the glass jar. It's like kids who can eat

205
00:12:11,380 --> 00:12:21,820
cigarettes at parties and then they try to eat them all but are red and then they go to the hospital. A guy at a party being like yo check this out just pulling his pants down and everyone just leaves the room.

206
00:12:21,820 --> 00:12:29,940
beer bottle into his ass and for my next trick. Yeah we hired this magician for

207
00:12:29,940 --> 00:12:35,140
Tyler's birthday and I god I don't even know what kind of tricks he did. Man I thought

208
00:12:35,140 --> 00:12:44,380
people would like this. I learned everything I know from Mac DeMarco. I

209
00:12:44,380 --> 00:12:51,620
I finished The Sopranos finally. Yeah. I finished it and I... What are you gonna do

210
00:12:51,620 --> 00:12:56,740
now? I don't know. I tried watching like all the like behind the scenes stuff to

211
00:12:56,740 --> 00:13:01,900
get like more of the show but I can't do it cuz James Gandolfini's real voice is

212
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:07,260
too bad. Yeah. I loved playing Tony Soprano. And to have like the coolest guy

213
00:13:07,260 --> 00:13:12,180
ever have that voice is such a bummer. You've never seen In The Loop? No. I've never seen anything.

214
00:13:12,180 --> 00:13:19,240
It's so fucked up when like to have that moment of clarity that you realize like every like tough guy or like soldier in a movie

215
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:24,660
Was like a theater kid. Yeah, exactly. Yeah, just being so realizing that you were like so easily fooled

216
00:13:24,660 --> 00:13:29,620
Yeah, it's like the acting actually I've always thought I was impervious to acting. Yeah

217
00:13:29,620 --> 00:13:35,660
Thought you were impervious to baby Yoda. I did think I was impervious to baby Yoda

218
00:13:35,660 --> 00:13:38,300
Nobody nice. No, he's

219
00:13:38,460 --> 00:13:42,140
His pull was too strong, but James Gandolfini, that was such a blow dude.

220
00:13:42,140 --> 00:13:44,860
I was like, I could, there was points in that show where I was like,

221
00:13:44,860 --> 00:13:48,540
I'd fuck this ugly fucking fat guy. And then to hear him be like,

222
00:13:48,540 --> 00:13:52,380
well, to get into the role, I really had to fucking think about pizza.

223
00:13:52,380 --> 00:13:54,780
Like that's such a disappointment.

224
00:13:54,780 --> 00:14:00,460
I was like, I was doing, I mean, I did so, I just talked to myself today because I had nobody around

225
00:14:00,460 --> 00:14:06,540
and I was doing James Gandolfini reacting to Two Girls, One Cup, like Tony Soprano.

226
00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:08,580
I don't know why.

227
00:14:08,580 --> 00:14:09,580
I don't know why.

228
00:14:09,580 --> 00:14:10,580
I'm thinking on the mind.

229
00:14:10,580 --> 00:14:11,580
Did you watch any video today?

230
00:14:11,580 --> 00:14:12,580
Maybe?

231
00:14:12,580 --> 00:14:13,580
I watched Two Girls One Cup when I woke up.

232
00:14:13,580 --> 00:14:17,980
I was just sitting there just like, "Whoa, look at these fucking two girls.

233
00:14:17,980 --> 00:14:19,540
What are they fucking...

234
00:14:19,540 --> 00:14:22,460
You're telling me they're gonna poop into a fucking cup?

235
00:14:22,460 --> 00:14:23,460
Disgusting."

236
00:14:23,460 --> 00:14:27,980
Okay, any other celebrities that you thought about watching Two Girls One Cup?

Jimmy Stewart?

240
00:14:31,340 --> 00:14:32,340

242
00:14:33,620 --> 00:14:34,620
I don't remember.

243
00:14:34,620 --> 00:14:35,620

That's my new year's resolution.

00:18:02,580 --> 00:18:06,580
you guys that's mine I I have the choice whether or not to say that you know I

296
00:18:06,580 --> 00:18:08,740
Between you and 8,000 people.

297
00:18:08,740 --> 00:18:10,020
Exactly, yeah.

298
00:18:10,020 --> 00:18:12,180
You gotta give it up for nudists, I guess.

299
00:18:12,180 --> 00:18:16,340
I mean, it's crazy that somebody can be that comfortable.

300
00:18:16,340 --> 00:18:19,340
Yeah, nude beaches, it is funny that nude beaches,

301
00:18:19,340 --> 00:18:20,180
your idea--

302
00:18:20,180 --> 00:18:22,460
And why do they only exist in France?

303
00:18:22,460 --> 00:18:23,540
Because they're French or perverts.

304
00:18:23,540 --> 00:18:25,180
'Cause they're fuckin', yeah, they're freaks.

305
00:18:25,180 --> 00:18:26,020
What do you mean?

306
00:18:26,020 --> 00:18:26,860
They also don't only exist,

307
00:18:26,860 --> 00:18:28,180
I think there's some in America,

308
00:18:28,180 --> 00:18:30,060
but they're private beaches.

309
00:18:30,060 --> 00:18:32,460
They're like owned by freak nudists

310
00:18:32,460 --> 00:18:34,140
who are like, "I wanna go here."

311
00:18:34,140 --> 00:18:35,260
And--

312
00:18:35,260 --> 00:18:40,700
yeah and they walk around. They're owned by like naked Waco people. Yeah, because if you own it

313
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:45,580
like you can be as nasty as you want to be on that beach. Yeah. You know what I mean?

314
00:18:45,580 --> 00:18:51,180
The ATF rating a nude beach.

315
00:18:51,180 --> 00:18:55,340
They would have to be nude too because how else would they sneak up on you. Exactly, they couldn't get to the beach.

316
00:18:55,340 --> 00:18:58,540
Well yeah, the bouncer would stop them. Right.

317
00:18:58,540 --> 00:19:01,380
I'm sorry, you're going to have to take off all this SWAT gear.

318
00:19:01,380 --> 00:19:05,220
yes is a new only be about search is the guy with the biggest wiener

319
00:19:05,220 --> 00:19:08,220
the only the only police officer they could take down a new disc on his

320
00:19:08,220 --> 00:19:09,420
robocop

321
00:19:09,420 --> 00:19:13,180
and true as he's gotten when i was a little trip and down to just be the

322
00:19:13,180 --> 00:19:14,740
brain

323
00:19:14,740 --> 00:19:18,380
yet you know i don't know all the metal like whether he doesn't have like the

324
00:19:18,380 --> 00:19:19,900
pleading on

325
00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:21,700
that's a very rare a lot of a cop

326
00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:22,300
yeah

327
00:19:22,300 --> 00:19:27,140
that was that was very fuckin weird in the a_t_m_s_ i want to see this boys

328
00:19:27,140 --> 00:19:29,180
veins right

329
00:19:29,180 --> 00:19:32,540
It did look, you know, it did look cool. I will take that back. I am backpedaling on that.

330
00:19:32,540 --> 00:19:34,540
He doesn't have a penis too, like...

331
00:19:34,540 --> 00:19:36,700
You should have a penis as a guy.

332
00:19:36,700 --> 00:19:37,580
As a robot.

333
00:19:37,580 --> 00:19:38,780
As a robot, come on.

334
00:19:38,780 --> 00:19:41,140
Where else is the, where else is the oil gonna come out?

335
00:19:41,140 --> 00:19:43,820
Yeah, exactly, yeah.

336
00:19:43,820 --> 00:19:48,100
Yeah, when you do the funny gag where you're like peeing on something, where's the oil gonna come from?

337
00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:48,600
Right.

338
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:50,980
Doesn't make any sense. You have to have like a USB stick.

339
00:19:50,980 --> 00:19:54,980
You're telling me, you're telling me a guy named C-3PO don't have no peno?

340
00:19:54,980 --> 00:19:56,420
It probably comes out of his mouth.

341
00:19:56,420 --> 00:19:57,880
Nah.

342
00:19:57,880 --> 00:20:00,600
They put a penis in C-3PO's mouth?

343
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:03,000
Well, I don't think he has a hole anywhere else.

344
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,000
I'll give him one.

345
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,400
His eyes aren't even holes.

346
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:06,400
He's got a hole in his belly.

347
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:07,400
He shows...

348
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:08,920
Why does he have an exposed midriff?

349
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:09,920
I never understood that.

350
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:10,920
Why does C-3PO show off his belly?

351
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:12,680
Because he's a gay robot.

352
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:13,880
That's like the whole thing.

353
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:14,880
His whole thing...

354
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:15,880
He doesn't have clothes though.

355
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:17,120
It's not like he has an exposed midriff.

356
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:18,120
He is plating.

357
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:19,120
He is plating.

358
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:20,120
He wears a suit.

359
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:21,120
Yeah, he wears metal plates.

360
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:22,120
He wears a tuxedo.

361
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:23,120
Let me see.

362
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:24,920
Are you remembering this wrong?

363
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:27,560
Are we thinking of different robots?

364
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:33,100
He wears a funny tuxedo and he's the waiter.

365
00:20:33,100 --> 00:20:34,560
He's the maitre d'

366
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:36,600
I see what you mean by an exposed midriff now.

367
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:37,600
I get it.

368
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:38,600
Yeah.

369
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:39,600
That is weird.

370
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:40,880
Why does he have that?

371
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:42,640
Yeah, there's no reason for that.

372
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:43,640
Show off the abs dude.

373
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:48,080
I guess it's so he can bend over for R2D2 if you know what I'm saying.

374
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:49,080
Oh shit.

375
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:50,080
You did not just say that.

376
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:56,000
Oh hell nah, but you're not wrong though.

377
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,760
uh... although but you're not wrong though

378
00:20:58,760 --> 00:21:02,520
i was a the droids in the in the mandalorian big downgrade from the

00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:17,760
bring up like the 15th most important part of a movie that Patrick is seen

403
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:23,880
because that is he will talk about that for an hour completely uninterrupted

404
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:29,200
it's fucking crazy it's such a bizarre skill that you have and you memorized

405
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:33,480
all of them you have an encyclopedia of things that nobody except you cares about

406
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:39,720
and you tap into it you go into a Sherlock Holmes mind palace do you think

407
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:46,720
about like like well Artie Bucco's restaurant yeah the menu is actually not

408
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:50,800

I loved that. I hated it dude. The Clancy Brown Satan, it's like he's also just like fat.

415
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:39,920
Yeah, so, no, I was just, dude, I fucking caught myself about to explain why he looks

416
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:46,440
like that. He looks like that because he's played by Clancy Brown. I, oh man, I was about

417
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:51,640
to explain like, oh well that's a race from the Cantina in episode 4. Yeah, you were about

418
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:58,600
to but you didn't do anything about episode 4 god yeah I just didn't like

419
00:24:58,600 --> 00:25:03,880
that cuz it may at least make Bill Burr fucking do a voice yeah like don't make

420
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:08,640
it just he's just doing this like I'm just expecting him Boston yeah like they

421
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:11,280
don't he does it like every other character they introduce in that show is

422
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:15,600
like oh this person has like some like really cool trait about them and Bill

423
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:21,520
Burr's is just like oh he has a robot gun on his back I kept expecting to be like

424
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:25,920
like talk about like traffic or something in the middle of it you know what I mean

425
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:31,800
but I got fucking socks tickets what are you doing

tattooing and let him walk around to just comment on everybody yeah yeah

428
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:42,760

434
00:26:24,980 --> 00:26:29,820
something I don't know one of those fucking stand-up sitcom shows about the

435
00:26:29,820 --> 00:26:33,900
Star Wars universe yeah like they should make the fucking like a Louis Holmes one

436
00:26:33,900 --> 00:26:38,740
yeah like yeah can you imagine it could be it could still be called crashing

437
00:26:38,740 --> 00:26:44,380
right but it's about their crashing spaceships yeah I just had a heart

438
00:26:44,380 --> 00:26:48,780
attack that's so pretty Wow it's so pretty

439
00:26:48,780 --> 00:26:55,580
it's crazy crashes a Corellian Corvette or something and then I'm homeless now I

440
00:26:55,580 --> 00:27:01,060
gotta do I don't think he like crashes his car in the show no no no we're

441
00:27:01,060 --> 00:27:03,740
talking about spaceships yeah you're right you're right I'm sorry don't

442
00:27:03,740 --> 00:27:07,380
fucking don't lose the vision of this goddamn show all right it's a really

443
00:27:07,380 --> 00:27:12,720
good idea for a show. Okay so Pete Holmes, everybody's favorite leading man. Yep.

444
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:18,720
He's a Gungan too. Perfect yeah. That makes perfect sense.

445
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:24,600
Mm-hmm. He has a Gungan attitude. He kind of is real-life Jar Jar Binks.

446
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:33,160
Yeah. Just like everybody hates him just because of the way he talks. Yeah and

447
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:36,700
And then he does stand-up comedy in different places.

448
00:27:36,700 --> 00:27:38,700
In the different cantinas.

449
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:42,700
I gotta go do five minutes on Dantooine. Can you guys give me a ride?

450
00:27:42,700 --> 00:27:46,700
He gets a ride all the way to Dantooine to do five minutes.

451
00:27:46,700 --> 00:27:47,200
Yeah.

452
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:49,200
Yeah, likely story, buddy.

453
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:51,200
He's like, "Oh, there's gonna be some agents."

454
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:53,200
What is this Pete Holmes voice I'm doing?

455
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:59,200
I don't think I've ever seen or seen Pete Holmes or heard him talk ever once in my life.

456
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:01,200
He looks like...

457
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:09,440
looks like John Ritter's son he kind of looks like white Slimer give you a

458
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:15,920
approximation but like seven feet tall right it's really a terrifying floating

459

So I'm just scrolling around here.

479
00:30:00,700 --> 00:30:04,420
First of all, at the bottom of their page, like where the copyright would usually be,

480
00:30:04,420 --> 00:30:07,620
they have a little paragraph that says "Responsible usage.

481
00:30:07,620 --> 00:30:09,760
Nicknames can be used in several positive ways.

482
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:12,420
Similarly, nicknames can be used as a negative tool.

00:30:12,420 --> 00:30:15,700

544
00:33:50,740 --> 00:33:53,660
Okay, go ahead.

545
00:33:53,660 --> 00:33:58,860
Do you need a list of nicknames for gangsters and gang members?

546
00:33:58,860 --> 00:34:01,140
Then you would find this article useful.

547
00:34:01,140 --> 00:34:06,940
Growing up, grandma used to say to me and my cousin, "Once the other gang members give

548
00:34:06,940 --> 00:34:09,000
you a nickname, there is no getting out."

549
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:12,460
This was her funny way of warning us about the dangers of joining a gang, but she was

550
00:34:12,460 --> 00:34:13,460
onto something.

551
00:34:13,460 --> 00:34:16,660
"Once you have risen to a level where the other gang members have a nickname for you,

552
00:34:16,660 --> 00:34:20,660
There's no getting out because for most gangs, death is the only ticket out of the gang.

553
00:34:20,660 --> 00:34:23,940
That's a link.

554
00:34:23,940 --> 00:34:24,940
In this article...

555
00:34:24,940 --> 00:34:31,140
The phrase "death is the only ticket out of the gang" links to a 404 on missouristate.edu.

556
00:34:31,140 --> 00:34:32,140
What?

557
00:34:32,140 --> 00:34:37,020
In this article, we share a list of badass nicknames for gangsters.

558
00:34:37,020 --> 00:34:40,900
These hood nicknames have been compiled from information available on popular gangs around

559
00:34:40,900 --> 00:34:41,900
the world.

560
00:34:41,900 --> 00:34:43,360
So they're not fictional names.

561
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:45,300
People actually answer these names.

562
00:34:45,300 --> 00:34:47,380
- Definition of a gang. - Never, never,

563
00:34:47,380 --> 00:34:50,620
ever yell any of these names out in public.

564
00:34:50,620 --> 00:34:52,020
- Someone might think you're a gangster

565
00:34:52,020 --> 00:34:52,860
and then they might let you rob them.

566
00:34:52,860 --> 00:34:54,580
- Well, it might be somebody's gang name.

567
00:34:54,580 --> 00:34:56,300
- Somebody-- - That's a good point.

568
00:34:56,300 --> 00:34:59,940
- My friend growing up told me not to say,

569
00:34:59,940 --> 00:35:01,420
I think I called someone Whitey

570
00:35:01,420 --> 00:35:02,780
and they said not to say that

571
00:35:02,780 --> 00:35:05,140
because Whitey Bulger could be around.

572
00:35:05,140 --> 00:35:06,620
- He could, dude.

573
00:35:06,620 --> 00:35:08,380
They didn't know where he was for a long time.

574
00:35:08,380 --> 00:35:11,220
- Yeah, no, this was in like 2004.

575
00:35:11,220 --> 00:35:12,060
- He could have been around,

576
00:35:12,060 --> 00:35:13,900
he could have killed you for that.

577
00:35:13,900 --> 00:35:21,580
somebody say my name yeah why behind the swing set that we were on yeah hey you

578
00:35:21,580 --> 00:35:24,660
guys need me you need to hire me for something yeah he's like Beetlejuice

579
00:35:24,660 --> 00:35:30,580
dude this is definition of a gangster there are a few kinds of gangsters the

580
00:35:30,580 --> 00:35:33,900
dictionary definition is a catch-all description of them though I'm not gonna

581
00:35:33,900 --> 00:35:37,100
read that yeah of course if you think about it there are as many different

582
00:35:37,100 --> 00:35:42,460
kinds of gangsters as there are stars in the sky this is so beautiful this is so

583
00:35:42,460 --> 00:35:46,540
mystical and when I say they are not nice people it's the understatement of the

584
00:35:46,540 --> 00:35:52,940
millennium did you know that there are 1.4 million gangsters in the u.s. 33,000

585
00:35:52,940 --> 00:35:56,700
gangs and these gangs commit 48% of violent crime like the idea that that'd

586
00:35:56,700 --> 00:36:04,380
be like a question on the census are you a gangster it's not a funny subject but

587
00:36:04,380 --> 00:36:07,860
just so we don't all start crying about it can you imagine how many nicknames

588
00:36:07,860 --> 00:36:12,820
there are for gangsters? Okay so now this is the different types. That's my guess. I guess a hundred

589
00:36:12,820 --> 00:36:17,860
or or plus. A hundred plus yeah. All right now let's take a look at the biggest gangs around the world

590
00:36:17,860 --> 00:36:23,940
and the nicknames for gang members associated with these groups. Here's the first one is Mafia and

591
00:36:23,940 --> 00:36:29,300
the the thing says the the blurb here says first of all the oldest and baddest the mafia or la

592
00:36:29,300 --> 00:36:34,180
cosa nostra our thing made glamorous by the godfather and movies of that ilk and colorful

593
00:36:34,180 --> 00:36:39,260
criminals like Al Capone, Buxy Seagal, Sam Giancana, and Jimmy Hoffa, whose body has never

594
00:36:39,260 --> 00:36:40,260
been found.

595
00:36:40,260 --> 00:36:41,260
I found it.

596
00:36:41,260 --> 00:36:42,260
Yeah, I didn't tell anybody.

597
00:36:42,260 --> 00:36:43,260
It was at the store.

598
00:36:43,260 --> 00:36:47,420
It was washed up on the beach.

599
00:36:47,420 --> 00:36:50,100
Got preserved by the ocean and it got washed up on the beach.

600
00:36:50,100 --> 00:36:51,420
I just found it in my house.

601
00:36:51,420 --> 00:36:53,500
I poked it.

602
00:36:53,500 --> 00:36:54,940
Mafia nicknames.

603
00:36:54,940 --> 00:36:55,940
Joe Banana.

604
00:36:55,940 --> 00:36:57,940
That's number one.

605
00:36:57,940 --> 00:37:01,260
Alright, off to a great start.

606
00:37:01,260 --> 00:37:05,580
I can visualize exactly in my head the gangster Joe Banana.

607
00:37:05,580 --> 00:37:06,580
I know exactly what that guy looks like.

608
00:37:06,580 --> 00:37:07,580
He wears a yellow suit.

609
00:37:07,580 --> 00:37:10,700
He wears a yellow suit and a brown hat.

610
00:37:10,700 --> 00:37:12,860
Can you visualize Johnny Sausage though?

611
00:37:12,860 --> 00:37:18,100
Oh Johnny Sausage probably wears a codpiece like Cameo.

612
00:37:18,100 --> 00:37:22,100
Baby Shanks and this is one of my favorites so far of these four.

613
00:37:22,100 --> 00:37:23,100
Butter Ass.

614
00:37:23,100 --> 00:37:26,140
Yeah, but oh man.

615
00:37:26,140 --> 00:37:27,140
Butter Ass.

616
00:37:27,140 --> 00:37:27,640
You fucking-

617
00:37:27,640 --> 00:37:29,880
You- uh- the dudes I used to run with, man.

618
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:31,000
Fucking butter ass.

619
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:33,440
He had the nicest fucking ass of any man-

620
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:35,640
Any man I've ever seen in my fucking-

621
00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:37,640
Real tough guys back in my day.

622
00:37:37,640 --> 00:37:39,940
Butter ass, bubble butt,

623
00:37:39,940 --> 00:37:42,640
beautiful butthole,

624
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:43,140
big roundy-

625
00:37:43,140 --> 00:37:46,440
Amazing ass butthole guy,

626
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:48,640
and fuckable butt.

627
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:51,140
Those are the five-

628
00:37:51,140 --> 00:37:54,640
The most dangerous of our fucking crew was fuckable butt.

629
00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:55,640
New York.

630
00:37:56,140 --> 00:37:59,140
fuckable butt, fuckable butt, come and weep

631
00:37:59,140 --> 00:38:01,140
everybody in this town knows Joe the twerker

632
00:38:01,140 --> 00:38:05,140
you don't wanna fuck with Joe the twerker

633
00:38:05,140 --> 00:38:07,140
you don't wanna fuck with Joey twerks

634
00:38:07,140 --> 00:38:09,140
Joe the twerker used to put a tommy gun in between his ass

635
00:38:09,140 --> 00:38:12,140
and he would shake that thing until the bullets were flying

636
00:38:12,140 --> 00:38:17,140
butter ass

637
00:38:17,140 --> 00:38:21,140
he would spray bullets at you from his fuckin ass

638
00:38:21,140 --> 00:38:24,140
we told him that he would sit on a stick of butter

639
00:38:24,140 --> 00:38:28,620
That's how they got Bonnie and Clyde. They got Bonnie and Clyde because they had butter.

640
00:38:28,620 --> 00:38:33,740
This guy could sit on a stick of Amish butter, one of those big logs, and make it disappear.

641
00:38:33,740 --> 00:38:41,900
Uh, Whack Whack and Quack Quack. You gotta imagine those are brothers.

642
00:38:41,900 --> 00:38:44,140
Those are twin brothers. Yeah, come on dude.

643
00:38:44,140 --> 00:38:46,380
Riddle me this, Mikey.

644
00:38:46,380 --> 00:38:49,500
Riddle me this, NYPD.

645
00:38:52,940 --> 00:38:56,220
Is it Wack Wack to which you speak or perhaps I am my brother?

646
00:38:56,220 --> 00:39:01,980
One of us tells the truth and the other sits on a stick of butter.

647
00:39:01,980 --> 00:39:06,860
We don't know whether to nail Wack Wack or Quack Quack in this Rico case.

648
00:39:06,860 --> 00:39:11,020
Pistol Pete that's like yeah.

649
00:39:11,020 --> 00:39:12,620
Pistol Pete.

650
00:39:12,620 --> 00:39:13,580

00:49:47,660 --> 00:49:51,860
matter where you're from. You can be a Russian guy named Stacks. This one gets

813
00:49:51,860 --> 00:50:02,540
progressively worse. Ace of Spades, Da Boss, Dreads, No, The Prophet, Icebox, and

814
00:50:02,540 --> 00:50:08,040
T-Bone, which is my dad's idea of a black guy's name. Yeah, exactly. My dad at the end of

815
00:50:08,040 --> 00:50:11,920
this one says, "Excuse me if a couple of these are offensive, but don't shoot the

816
00:50:11,920 --> 00:50:16,360
messenger. I only found them." My dad, every time he sees a black guy at Walmart, he

817
00:50:16,360 --> 00:50:22,960
looks at the name tag expecting t-bone he's like it's probably t-bone here's a

864
00:53:32,760 --> 00:53:36,760
These are much better for supervillain names than gangster names, I feel like.

865
00:53:36,760 --> 00:53:39,260
Almost all these would work perfectly as a super...

866

00:53:41,260 --> 00:53:45,760

883
00:54:36,620 --> 00:54:39,180

884
00:54:39,180 --> 00:54:40,440

00:54:42,740 --> 00:54:43,580

- All right, we gotta hurry through.

888
00:54:45,100 --> 00:54:46,740
(laughing)

889
00:54:46,740 --> 00:54:50,740
Well, why does it, it fools you here. It says, "Last but not least, let's not forget the biker gangs.

890
00:54:50,740 --> 00:54:54,740
There are many and varied, but they all go under the umbrella name of the 'one percenters'."

891
00:54:54,740 --> 00:54:55,740
Isn't that like the...

892
00:54:55,740 --> 00:54:56,740
Yeah, what the hell?

893
00:54:56,740 --> 00:54:57,740
Nation of Islam?

894
00:54:57,740 --> 00:54:58,740
What the fuck?

895
00:54:58,740 --> 00:55:01,740
I want those names, dude. Those are some cool names.

896
00:55:01,740 --> 00:55:02,740
Yeah.

897
00:55:02,740 --> 00:55:04,740
"They're even assigned military ranks."

898
00:55:04,740 --> 00:55:06,740
Aren't... Okay.

899
00:55:06,740 --> 00:55:10,740
"Women in these gangs have no status. They are the property of one of the gang members,

900
00:55:10,740 --> 00:55:14,740
and can be passed around from one member to the other with the owner's permission, of course."

901
00:55:14,740 --> 00:55:15,740
Ugh.

902
00:55:15,740 --> 00:55:21,580
Oh I hate that. I hate that so much. These biker gangs aren't as nice as I thought they were.

903
00:55:21,580 --> 00:55:25,260
There are also prospects who are hopefuls who want to get into the gangs. They have

904
00:55:25,260 --> 00:55:28,540
to do all the dirty demeaning jobs for about a year and then they might or

905
00:55:28,540 --> 00:55:32,340
might not be allowed to get into the hallowed ranks. Names of the gangs are of

906
00:55:32,340 --> 00:55:37,280
course Hells Angels, Pagans, Mongols, Outlaws, Banditos, Sons of Silence, Vagos,

907
00:55:37,280 --> 00:55:41,780
Cossacks, and other lesser-known ones who are just as evil and nasty. All of these

908
00:55:41,780 --> 00:55:49,180
names are just Borderlands names. Right. Yeah, definitely. Handlebars. That's my biker gang.

909

Yeah I got Morgan Freeman I mean these are all white supremacist name gang

954
00:58:51,980 --> 00:58:56,080
gang names these are made up of all sorts of people in the white community

955
00:58:56,080 --> 00:59:01,000
from trailer trash to PhDs who all believe in the superiority of white

956
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:04,560
people over all ethnic groups the most famous of these is the Ku Klux Klan there

957
00:59:04,560 --> 00:59:08,920
There are also the Nazi Party and the skinheads.

958
00:59:08,920 --> 00:59:09,920
That's facts.

959
00:59:09,920 --> 00:59:14,040
I want to skip over, there's got smaller gangs here.

960
00:59:14,040 --> 00:59:18,960
The next one is, this is fucked up, this is, they have some shots fired here.

961
00:59:18,960 --> 00:59:24,400
The next section is gangstas, and it says, "Gangstas are wannabe gangsters who think

962
00:59:24,400 --> 00:59:25,760
they are real criminals.

963
00:59:25,760 --> 00:59:30,960
They indulge in petty theft, graffiti-dobbing, and hurling sexist insults at women.

964
00:59:30,960 --> 00:59:33,800
They are despised by the really mean guys."

965
00:59:33,800 --> 00:59:40,320
will do you know. The next section is my gangsta names. If I was a gang member my name would

966
00:59:40,320 --> 00:59:44,840
be Tigress because a tiger is the biggest fiercest cat there is and the most beautiful. You can

967
00:59:44,840 --> 00:59:49,480
use gangster and rapper generators on social media. On one of them my gangster name is Crispy

968
00:59:49,480 --> 00:59:56,480
Mama and my rap name is Smokeboo. Is it this by the editorial board? This is by the Boston

969
00:59:58,560 --> 01:00:02,520
globe yeah one member of the spotlight team just snuck that in they have

970
01:00:02,520 --> 01:00:07,600
popular gangster rappers there's just a list of rappers oh and now here's a

971
01:00:07,600 --> 01:00:11,520
good part yeah yeah this is what I wanted to get to yeah good this is good

972
01:00:11,520 --> 01:00:16,000
thing this is the plus yeah general from 100 so these guys I'm guessing are not

973
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:20,640
necessarily gangsters as the image is just a guy in a suit with sunglasses on
