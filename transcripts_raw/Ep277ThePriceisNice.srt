1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:14,840
Take your hat off right now and put these on and wear a red shirt. Number

2
00:00:14,840 --> 00:00:21,940
one, number one, number one, Nigel Uno. Nigel Uno from Codenames Cazen. Where

3
00:00:21,940 --> 00:00:28,740
was he from? England. Oh, what did he talk about? I don't. Can you play? I'm

4
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:33,200
you're going to get them all my name say like I have a new invention. I have a

5
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:37,780
new two by four technology. You're okay, Australian a little. I thought he was

6
00:00:37,780 --> 00:00:42,580
us. You know that's the blonde one. Yeah, kind of ruined it. Yeah, it wasn't

7
00:00:42,580 --> 00:00:46,420
that good. You also weren't wearing a red shirt. If you had a red, you do

8
00:00:46,420 --> 00:00:50,140
that yeah, but you should be able to think on your feet. I know I didn't like

9
00:00:50,140 --> 00:00:53,460
you give me these sunglasses. If he had put these on me, I like I would just be

10
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:53,980
like this

11
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:55,880
surfs up to

12
00:00:55,880 --> 00:01:00,980
see, but that's not Patrick laugh. That's not night Nigel uno, but it's

13
00:01:00,980 --> 00:01:03,480
like I'm thinking my feet. I'm improvising. You know I'm rolling with

14
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:07,320
the punches. I'm doing something that's funny. He became a surfer. I can do

15
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:07,780
that, too.

16
00:01:07,780 --> 00:01:12,380
Well, do you so different prop now? This has been used? Yeah, I got another. Oh,

17
00:01:12,380 --> 00:01:18,900
I'm completely blind. No, you're not. Who said that me? Who's you?

18
00:01:21,100 --> 00:01:24,700
Don't laugh at that. That's not funny. It's funnier to be blind.

19
00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:28,620
Being a surfer is funnier than being... First of all, laughing at blindness is

20
00:01:28,620 --> 00:01:30,700
punching down. Yeah, that's punching down as a disability. Laughing at surfers

21
00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:33,420
are punching... That's a disability. Surfing is not a disability. If you're

22
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:36,300
stupid enough to fucking hang out with sharks, you have a mental disability.

23
00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:38,500
You're not hanging out with sharks, you're hanging out with waves. You have

24
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:41,500
a mental deficit if you are hanging out with waves and sharks and fish.

25
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:43,340
And you think that those are friends. They said I had a mental deficit and I

26
00:01:43,340 --> 00:01:44,700
still got into college, so...

27
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:49,380
You got into college more than any of us. I got into three colleges. Yeah,

28
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:53,460
that's actually pretty impressive. Three colleges dropped out of each one. Toby

29
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:57,620
motherfucking Keith is dead man. I know. Fuck dude! It actually was, I was

30
00:01:57,620 --> 00:02:00,980
listening to a, I was listening to a lot of Toby Keith in the past couple of

31
00:02:00,980 --> 00:02:04,380
weeks on its, genuinely. I ain't as, Toby Keith and Tim McGraw I've been

32
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:04,940
listening to.

33
00:02:04,940 --> 00:02:10,580
I ain't as alive as I once was. But I'm as dead once. Well, you know what guys?

34
00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:13,940
I'm covered in dirt and worms on me now. All these people, all these people.

35
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:21,140
there was a time back in my prime when I got up and walked around. I love this

36
00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:25,660
great. I love my great it's my kind of great.

37
00:02:25,660 --> 00:02:33,740
It's all dirt and stuff and grass. Yeah, they buried me up my

38
00:02:33,740 --> 00:02:38,860
on my face on my ass. They said Toby,

39
00:02:38,860 --> 00:02:43,820
you passed away, Toby, Toby, you have passed away man and I'm sorry. I was the

40
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:49,800
another one. I was for my grave yeah and flesh for my worms. Well, that could

41
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:56,660
work to a good flower, flowers for my grave flesh for my worm horse,

42
00:02:56,660 --> 00:02:58,780
worm horse, my wormies

43
00:02:58,780 --> 00:03:01,480
because these are my wormies

44
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:06,200
dude. Oh my God, that'll be a great thing for an edgy guy like Marilyn

45
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:08,860
Manson to do to be like raisin, take care of a bunch of worms and be like

46
00:03:08,860 --> 00:03:12,860
yeah. When I die, release these into my grave, that's actually so fucking

47
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:18,240
marry me with my worms, because like if you did because the the supreme edgy

48
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:21,980
thing to do would be like I let my dog eat me after I die, but you can't do

49
00:03:21,980 --> 00:03:26,060
that. No, the dogs are interested in the or you get a pig farm anyway. Pig farm

50
00:03:26,060 --> 00:03:29,900
go snatch style yeah, but like people, people get mad at that. They won't let

51
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:33,020
the pigs do it, but worms it's like you're already dead and you just put a

52
00:03:33,020 --> 00:03:36,180
yeah. The worms are going to eat you anyway. Exactly that's true, but anyway

53
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:39,500
ever all these people saying rest in peace, Toby keep this rest in peace till

54
00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:43,700
I'll keep that well guys rest in piss Toby Keith, because I actually think it

55
00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:47,740
was a piece of shit. Watch your fucking now watch it. He wasn't watch it. He

56
00:03:47,740 --> 00:03:54,040
was an SJW wait really yeah. What's he you Toby Keith? Was he an S? Hey Toby

57
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:57,740
Keith fuck you man. You see that I know that you were an SJW and now that I

58
00:03:57,740 --> 00:04:02,040
realize this your dog shit to me and I'm glad you're dead. There was a there's

59
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:05,940
this like fake story that goes around about how Chris Christopherson

60
00:04:07,340 --> 00:04:10,740
made fun of or it said like you the hell's that Chris Christo you don't know

61
00:04:10,740 --> 00:04:14,340
he was in the highwayman I think with Willie Nelson and Johnny Cash.

62
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:15,340
Oh, Stars Born.

63
00:04:15,340 --> 00:04:16,340
SNL.

64
00:04:16,340 --> 00:04:17,340
Stars Born.

65
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:18,340
He was in SNL.

66
00:04:18,340 --> 00:04:19,340
Oh, okay.

67
00:04:19,340 --> 00:04:20,340
Yeah.

68
00:04:20,340 --> 00:04:21,740
But there's like this fake story that goes around like I think they were like buddies

69
00:04:21,740 --> 00:04:28,940
and everyone was like yeah Chris Christofferson told him that he didn't serve this country,

70
00:04:28,940 --> 00:04:31,820
he's pretending to be a patriot or whatever.

71
00:04:31,820 --> 00:04:33,820
And that's going around again now that he's dead.

72
00:04:33,820 --> 00:04:38,460
Toby Keith is responsible for probably half of the deaths in the Iraq war.

73
00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:39,060
Oh, absolutely.

74
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:42,580
This guy can't, you can't, this guy deserves every medal on earth.

75
00:04:42,580 --> 00:04:45,580
You can't write the Taliban song and not get a purple heart.

76
00:04:45,580 --> 00:04:50,020
Dude, how many fucking people listen to a Toby Keith song?

77
00:04:50,020 --> 00:04:51,820
American soldier.

78
00:04:51,820 --> 00:04:52,620
Literally, there are...

79
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:54,260
I'm an American.

80
00:04:54,260 --> 00:04:57,860
Toby Keith songs led to the loss of so many legs.

81
00:04:57,860 --> 00:05:00,260
So many guys who were like so good at football.

82
00:05:00,260 --> 00:05:06,820
Toby Keith is the as has legs on his on his head. Yeah, you know how they paint

83
00:05:06,820 --> 00:05:10,300
how they they paint planes on like a plane when they shoot him down. He was on

84
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:13,260
his guitar. He was painting legs, just tons of white legs,

85
00:05:13,260 --> 00:05:18,860
bones all over his guitar, just a bunch of femur bone and not even you know

86
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:22,820
sitting on a throne made of bones, white bones and fucking shin bones. We're

87
00:05:22,820 --> 00:05:26,620
thinking about his cousin leg. We're thinking about cousin legs right, but

88
00:05:26,620 --> 00:05:28,460
we're not considering how many

89
00:05:28,460 --> 00:05:28,960
the

90
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:34,900
whiskey related alcohol deaths for these women. Oh, that was something I wanted

91
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:38,500
to talk about, man. I think that this might be... There's no question in my

92
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:40,780
mind that this was an alcohol related passing away.

93
00:05:40,780 --> 00:05:44,820
I think... Oh, 'cause he loves bars? 'Cause he loves bars and he's spending

94
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:48,340
all his... He loves at least one bar. Yeah, he loves one bar. I guess that's

95
00:05:48,340 --> 00:05:52,500
true. I guess that's true, but he says, "Red Solo Cup, I fill you up." So he

96
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:55,580
also likes parties. Yeah. And what do you do at parties with a red solo? That

97
00:05:55,580 --> 00:05:59,680
a picnic. He likes a whiskey girl. And so many women were trying to do him and they started

98
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:04,400
getting into whiskey. Women can't, that's a man's drink. You can't drink whiskey if you're

99
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:07,640
a girl. That's the point of the song. You don't actually put hair on your chest and

100
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:11,000
then nobody wants to date you. Yeah, then Toby Keith won't want to date you. You think

101
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:15,240
he's telling the truth and that's how he's lying? I think this is, I hate saying this,

102
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:19,800
I hate even thinking about this, I think that the tide is turning on alcohol in America.

103
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:23,720
Yeah, absolutely. I think that Toby Keith, this death is going to be the first of many

104
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:28,720
alcohol related deaths that we see probably me and Patrick soonly following.

105
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:31,440
And the younger generation are not.

106
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:33,080
They're all addicted to vapes and zins.

107
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:35,000
They don't even want to drink alcohol anymore.

108
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:39,400
I saw something like Gen Z is the least alcohol drinking generation ever.

109
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:40,400
They don't like it.

110
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:41,400
How?

111
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:42,400
It's because they're fruits.

112
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:43,400
They'll grow into it.

113
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:44,400
No, they won't.

114
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:45,400
We're technically Gen Z.

115
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:46,400
I think it's because they're...

116
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:47,680
We're Gen Z on the technicality, you know?

117
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:48,680
Well, wait, yeah.

118
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:53,480
Gen Z isn't Gen Z like they've been legal to drink for what, four or five years?

119
00:06:53,480 --> 00:07:01,760
Yes, and they haven't started in 97. I'm a day walker for the Z lineal. I'm I can navigate

120
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:07,000
millennial spaces as well as Gen Z. Stalker. Yeah, I'm not a gay stalker. You're also we're

121
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:11,480
all day walkers here. I don't know what that we can navigate millennial space. We can say

122
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:17,560
stuff about Matt Kim, but also he told millennial man. They if they put they say I'm a zoomer,

123
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:22,900
I don't care, but I have you want to claim that say doggo right now. That's

124
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:26,520
well. That's what I mean, dude. I've I can I'm so much more likely to connect

125
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:29,320
with somebody who says doggo than somebody. Yeah, that's true.

126
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:33,960
True. There's no can you imagine being in a like? Yeah, I don't know if I'm

127
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:38,280
gonna party full of millennials only. Yeah, I'm gonna do okay. I'm fine. I'm

128
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:43,600
in. I'm with my my home turf. You might bring a slice of pizza. Now touch my

129
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:48,440
button. Give me a millennial right there. That's yeah zoomers. They do not eat

130
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:51,520
pizza. What house are you? They don't eat. They don't like. I'm definitely

131
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:55,760
Ravenclaw. See he knew immediately what I meant. It's we're all millennial.

132
00:07:55,760 --> 00:08:00,120
They were not zoom. You might be zoomer. You're zoomer. You're actually full

133
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:03,440
zoomer. No, I'm day walker bro. No, you're not man. You're full zoom. No,

134
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:06,480
I'm day walker. No, I'm not a full zoomer because I like alcohol and I hate

135
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:07,280
weed. I got a

136
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:12,160
I can go to the hookah bar. I can go to the regular bar.

137
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:15,880
they accept me. Why don't they have hookah bar? Why is there a hookah bar,

138
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:18,260
but there's no cigarette bar? We can just smoke cigarettes and smoke.

139
00:08:18,260 --> 00:08:20,620
They got it in Pittsburgh, dude. They have some of those. Hookah,

140
00:08:20,620 --> 00:08:25,320
Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Why the hell did we do a show there? You saying a

141
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:28,440
city made me remember. I wanna do the plug at the top, but I'll do it.

142
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:32,460
We'll do it eight minutes in. Guys, we're adding some shows to the tour.

143
00:08:32,460 --> 00:08:36,840
Oh my God. Holy fuck. These guys, these are not your typical... And Julio,

144
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:38,960
I'm gonna send this picture to you right now so you can pull it

145
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:43,640
up on screen. I'm so strong from the new shows. We're doing the sketch. We're doing the sketch

146
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:51,220
tour of course that you guys all already know about and bought tickets for. He's been obsessed

147
00:08:51,220 --> 00:08:55,880
with my strength. I have been touching Patrick a lot just trying to get him to flex. You

148
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:59,120
tried to fully molest me earlier. He doesn't care about my strength at all. You saw that

149
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:03,680
too. I did see it. I wasn't trying to molest you man. You're being dramatic. He was touching

150
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:08,020
up on me. You never had a good friend before who touches you. I felt what felt like a piece

151
00:09:08,020 --> 00:09:11,480
piece of wood touching the back of the chair. I had some and you know what I'm

152
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:15,140
saying. I'm construction less station vibes got a car station unless he asked

153
00:09:15,140 --> 00:09:15,940
you to touch it.

154
00:09:15,940 --> 00:09:18,420
By the way, we have

155
00:09:18,420 --> 00:09:22,980

156
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:26,820

157
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:30,140
hitting the major cities on this one that we haven't been to yet. Guys, we are

158
00:09:30,140 --> 00:09:35,460
going to Minneapolis on March 30th at Sisyphus Brewing. We're hitting Detroit

159
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:40,620
April 3rd at Loving Touch and of course the Jewel of America. We're going to Carborough,

160
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:45,940
North Carolina on 4/26. Caleb tried to give me a Loving Touch earlier. So go ahead. I

161
00:09:45,940 --> 00:09:49,300
tried to give you a Jewel of Me. These ticket links are supposed to be up by the time this

162
00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:55,020
comes out. It's just a fissy in how much you try to fuck me. They might not be up on the

163
00:09:55,020 --> 00:09:59,420
website yet, so if you go to the website, try to buy it and you don't see them, just

164
00:09:59,420 --> 00:10:02,780
keep hitting F5 for the next few days. But they're supposed to be up tomorrow. We'll

165
00:10:02,780 --> 00:10:06,380
I know at least Minneapolis is already up. Well, you and me have had so much

166
00:10:06,380 --> 00:10:12,060
tension over the years about our bodies being close to each other. You guys have a real will

167
00:10:12,060 --> 00:10:15,660
they won't they? I feel like for me with both you guys, it's like it's a will. They will.

168
00:10:15,660 --> 00:10:24,620
And that's how I feel about you and Jubio. You can't feel that way about some about two other

169
00:10:24,620 --> 00:10:28,060
people. This is like if Fleetwood Mac, if they were all boned. Are you feeling will they won't

170
00:10:28,060 --> 00:10:31,820
they about me and Jubio? You're saying that you think me and him have done it. If Fleetwood Mac

171
00:10:31,820 --> 00:10:35,120
Jack was all doing it and they got along after they were all doing it.

172
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:38,300
That's what this podcast I got an argument, some kind of fear between you

173
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:42,080
about I gotten it. Well, I got I have no fear. He can touch me a little bit

174
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:46,620
like I got into an argument with somebody yesterday about how they were

175
00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:51,040
like yeah. I'm zero percent gay. Somebody has to have talked about this

176
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:55,260
before they said I'm zero percent gay and I said, but you would probably like

177
00:10:55,260 --> 00:10:57,080
it if it was the best one ever

178
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:58,180
yeah,

179
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:04,380
the hottest guy, but not even like the best, the best experience, anything that

180
00:11:04,380 --> 00:11:09,240
you think you don't like the best ever of that thing. I've definitely like right

181
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:12,760
no yeah, it's like you get up in the you get up in the plane to go skydiving

182
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:16,720
you're like take me back down. I can't do it. Please they go. No, you're doing

183
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:20,600
it. You got your parachute on they push you up. Oh, my God, yeah, oh, my God, I

184
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:24,640
feel alive for the first time in my life. I feel alive. This is exactly

185
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:28,440
about it for months after we've had this conversation. We've had this

186
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:31,840
I need to go again. The wife walks in and you close your phone quick. You're

187
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:32,780
looking at skydiving

188
00:11:32,780 --> 00:11:39,120
jumping off of the bureau in your bedroom is never the same. Never, never

189
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:42,640
you have to go all the way. I'm saying man, I videos of people skydiving

190
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:46,860
doesn't cut it. No, I feel like everybody's so saying I'm straight and I

191
00:11:46,860 --> 00:11:51,080
or I'm gay, but you've never had the best version of the other yeah, because

192
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:54,980
I think I think I used to think I didn't like sushi and then I had very

193
00:11:55,020 --> 00:12:00,160
expensive nice sushi one time and now I'm like kind of thinking about sushi more

194
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:04,360
we've and then also a conversation about food. Once you have the bet really yeah,

195
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:08,660
well, I think that it also comes to sex experiences. Once you've had the best of

196
00:12:08,660 --> 00:12:13,520
that, once I've had the best different kind of sex, now I'm looking of course

197
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:16,860
it's going to feel good. It's sex, it's going to feel amazing. It's in the it's

198
00:12:16,860 --> 00:12:21,380
in the name and then once I start raising, say amazing sex is in the name.

199
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:25,100
once I have the most amazing sex, I'm sure it would be amazing, but then I'm

200
00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:28,520
going to start it's the it's just like the sushi. Now I'm getting grocery store

201
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:34,280
sushi. Yeah, right now you're like now, which is the best form of sushi. No, not

202
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:38,100
well. It's crazy to me that you didn't like sushi before. Yeah, that is fucked.

203
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:42,200
It's weird. I didn't not like it. I just said you didn't like I didn't opt for. I

204
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:45,400
got some this weekend. I got grocery store sushi this weekend. Well, no, it

205
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:49,240
was the triangle. I got grocery store groceries this this week.

206
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:54,880
pray tell about this grocery store groceries. What's your haul? Flatbread,

207
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:58,680
mozzarella, and pizza sauce. Guess what I was making with that? He's getting,

208
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:02,680
he's getting a pizza sandwich. Flatbread pizza, y'all. He's getting, he's getting

209
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:06,040
gigantic, this guy. I thought you were gonna make pizza soup. I got cereal as

210
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:10,560
well. Pizza soup. Pizza soup. That's leftovers, dude. When you make homemade

211
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:13,680
pizza and you get to eat pizza soup for the rest of the week. Oh my god,

212
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:17,480
that's so good. It's like a Thanksgiving sandwich. Making pepperoni stock for

213
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:23,540
your pizza soup. It's so good. Pepperoni stock is great. Dude, on my pizza I had

214
00:13:23,540 --> 00:13:28,880
some arugula. I had some prosciutto. Not a pizza man. Yeah, that's a flatbread.

215
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:31,720
Yeah, what was a flatbread pizza? Well, yeah, you already said you got a

216
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:35,000
flatbread. Yeah, so I don't really understand. Did you do pizza sauce?

217
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:38,680
Yeah, that's I said pizza sauce. Wait, you did pizza sauce, arugula and

218
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:43,760
pepperonis? Not pepperonis, prosciutto. Prosciutto. Okay, this sounds like a

219
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:47,440
pretty good pizza. It was okay. I think it would be better the second time

220
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:50,940
I made it if you put it in a wood fired oven, it would probably be amazing.

221
00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:53,940
Yeah, definitely wood fired oven. Yeah, I was thinking of that when I was

222
00:13:53,940 --> 00:13:54,500
making it.

223
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:58,240
You can get one for the home. There's cost $300. Well, I was thinking just

224
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:00,580
maybe putting wood into my gas powered oven.

225
00:14:00,580 --> 00:14:04,620
Oh, my oven has started smelling like gas again. I think it's happening once

226
00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:04,860
more.

227
00:14:04,860 --> 00:14:09,200
Well, you know that you know the burst of gas smell when you turn on your

228
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:11,380
oven, when you start preheating your oven, that always gets me. I'm always

229
00:14:11,380 --> 00:14:14,940
like, "Whoa, whoa!" And then it goes like a few minutes go by and it's

230
00:14:14,940 --> 00:14:19,900
we were having that meeting earlier about those shows and Alex was like do we

231
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:22,800
have a co two monitor in the house? I want to get one because it's starting

232
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:23,900
to smell like gas and

233
00:14:23,900 --> 00:14:27,260
a monitor yeah that's what he said, which I didn't want to call him out, but I

234
00:14:27,260 --> 00:14:29,380
don't think that funny yeah, but

235
00:14:29,380 --> 00:14:33,700
do we have a nitrogen monitor? The air is seventy five percent nitrogen in

236
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:38,580
your house. You need to leave, but the air his room is next to the kitchen and

237
00:14:38,580 --> 00:14:40,380
the air smelled like that because I

238
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:44,760
accident. I was making a cream sauce type thing and I needed to simmer and

239
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:46,900
then forgot to turn the way

240
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:52,140
wait. Let me stop you right there. You're telling me you were creaming and

241
00:14:52,140 --> 00:14:53,200
your roommate smelled it.

242
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:58,140
That's nasty. What what the fuck? It's actually kind of you're creaming out in

243
00:14:58,140 --> 00:15:01,740
the kitchen. Yeah, and I left in the runner on. I left the burner on for

244
00:15:01,740 --> 00:15:05,160
probably an hour and a half. It was fire. What's the

245
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:06,820
burned for an hour?

246
00:15:08,860 --> 00:15:13,980
how long is X men origins Wolverine stop talking about X men, bitch no shut the

247
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:17,860
fuck up. I'm sick of this. I'm done with you. The other day we get on a meeting

248
00:15:17,860 --> 00:15:22,220
and he's we just came from the gym and he's like look what I found on the way

249
00:15:22,220 --> 00:15:28,020
back from the gym to giant X men comic books. Fuck you man. You I've been

250
00:15:28,020 --> 00:15:31,500
watching now you're now you're changing the universe. You're changing reality to

251
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:36,180
give you free X men. So that's my power. You're not yes, you're not an Omega level

252
00:15:36,220 --> 00:15:40,420
I am an omega level. You can bend reality to my will. You are not an omega level

253
00:15:40,420 --> 00:15:44,960
mutant. I had a really thought that was really at first it kind of tickled me

254
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:49,720
pink and then it started to-, I can't tell if this is a cogent thought at all,

255
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:52,700
but I want to tell you guys this thought I had about the Simpsons. I was watching

256
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:54,300
the Simpsons. I've been re-watching it. Were you watching the X-Men episode? I

257
00:15:54,300 --> 00:15:57,220
can tell you're watching the Simpsons because you wore a Simpsons skin shirt.

258
00:15:57,220 --> 00:16:01,180
Oh my God. I would have killed a Simpson, one of the less important ones, so that

259
00:16:01,180 --> 00:16:03,300
nobody cares. You skinned a Simpson alive and you made a shirt with him. Hans

260
00:16:03,340 --> 00:16:07,140
small man, but can you imagine living in the Simpsons universe living in

261
00:16:07,140 --> 00:16:11,580
Springfield, along with the Simpsons and every time you watch TV, it's like

262
00:16:11,580 --> 00:16:15,060
someone else from your town. It's always like oh they're interviewing my doctor.

263
00:16:15,060 --> 00:16:19,260
Oh, that's crusting the cloud.

264
00:16:19,260 --> 00:16:22,600
No, there's my neighbor. Oh, that's my son.

265
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:29,600
Somebody else, you know, you only have public access at that point. It's just

266
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:32,560
so funny that it's like their interview. They interview like oh, this is dr nick

267
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:34,600
of year and they're like oh that's that doctor. I see like

268
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:39,880
twenty times before yeah. Oh these are all oh they're oh a poos on TV. Now

269
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:43,640
yeah, it would be so incredible to watch TV and every time it's a different

270
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:47,880
person from yeah. I haven't seen I haven't seen too much of the Simpsons.

271
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:51,420
I've seen enough, but that's great. That is crazy, which I would have that's a

272
00:16:51,420 --> 00:16:55,120
reveal. I was watching well when I was a kid. I did you not seeing girl. I

273
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:59,340
didn't see the Simpsons until I was in the girls either middle school girls. I

274
00:16:59,380 --> 00:17:03,420
I watch I watch family guy in South Park, we good, then I think it you can tell

275
00:17:03,420 --> 00:17:07,700
did you twisted mind you are not. That means that you're not like like me and

276
00:17:07,700 --> 00:17:11,620
Cameron people see us and they smell Harvard right because we grew up with

277
00:17:11,620 --> 00:17:16,140
the pedigree. Yes, exactly. You see me, a serbic. They look at you, you're

278
00:17:16,140 --> 00:17:22,020
thinking, you're thinking Plymouth State University, maybe maybe Keene State

279
00:17:22,020 --> 00:17:26,060
University. Isn't it ironic these kind of universities that have parties, the

280
00:17:26,100 --> 00:17:30,020
community probably goes to a professional writing school rather than a community

281
00:17:30,020 --> 00:17:33,240
college. Interesting. That's right. That's right. And I've been to two. I've been to

282
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:36,860
two community colleges. And you watched community? I never watched it. There you go. You made

283
00:17:36,860 --> 00:17:41,220
community be very, very different. Yeah. It's clear watching that show that

284
00:17:41,220 --> 00:17:44,340
these people have never been to a community college. No, they don't know about the Rubik's

285
00:17:44,340 --> 00:17:49,220
Cube. They're like, "Oh, it happens at a community college. Probably a blanket for it." There is always, in

286
00:17:49,220 --> 00:17:53,820
every single, every community college I went to, every community college I went to,

287
00:17:53,820 --> 00:17:58,860
to kid walking around the school who is practicing rubix cube speed thing with

288
00:17:58,860 --> 00:18:02,900
one let me say also smarter than anybody. Why is he there? Here's a roast for

289
00:18:02,900 --> 00:18:06,700
their tv show community. Yeah, that's a boring ass name for a tv show. Yeah,

290
00:18:06,700 --> 00:18:11,920
mit blam yeah blam laughter. Yeah, that's a better name community. It's a

291
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:15,540
boring word. You have to open the thesaurus to find that one. There was a

292
00:18:15,540 --> 00:18:18,620
show called kablam. I don't know if you knew this really yeah, Nickelodeon.

293
00:18:18,660 --> 00:18:23,500
why is it said blam laughter? He's a blam, blam, blam, blam, blam, blam,

294
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:27,680
laughter, it's not a blam exclamation point colon, laughter, laughter, it's

295
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:31,740
also do blam sorrow and it's clear to me that the people who information the

296
00:18:31,740 --> 00:18:36,420
office never works in an office either yeah. Well, they worked at Harvard

297
00:18:36,420 --> 00:18:39,500
University. Can you imagine how amazing you should write a show called writer's

298
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:43,620
room? Yeah, nothing like an actual writer. Yes, because we've never been in

299
00:18:43,620 --> 00:18:47,740
one of them. Here's the thing, Paul Provenza, you're not in the green room,

300
00:18:47,820 --> 00:18:51,420
you're on a stage. There's thousands of people around you in the middle of the

301
00:18:51,420 --> 00:18:57,220
not for last festival. You idiot. He's so dumb Paul Provenza, but one of the best

302
00:18:57,220 --> 00:19:00,620
standups of all time. Yeah, everyone talks about his standup. Everyone says,

303
00:19:00,620 --> 00:19:04,820
dude, you should have seen Paul Provenza back in the day. He has a, is it, have

304
00:19:04,820 --> 00:19:08,520
you seen that one episode of Green Room where he's wearing that t-shirt? No. It

305
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:14,320
says, we are all African. I want that t-shirt so bad. That's a Richard Dawkins

306
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:19,760
t-shirt really yeah. Richard Dawkins is I think in his Twitter picture is wearing

307
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:26,240
that shirt. That's badass. Yeah, so it's like it was like an early or late 2000s

308
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:30,880
like atheist thing. Yeah, being African. Yeah, because of the we are all

309
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:35,080
origin of the human race, but a land bridge, but you know they say maybe that

310
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:39,640
there that some Native American people were here. They were in America even

311
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:43,680
but they didn't emigrate from Africa. What was the first where who was the first

312
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:47,680
guy who transformed from a I mean imagine how weird that was being born and you're

313
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:51,420
a man and you have two monkey parents. Well, even more than that man, they the

314
00:19:51,420 --> 00:19:54,800
Neanderthals and the Homo sapiens, they coexisted, they were around at the same

315
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:58,840
time and Neanderthals probably died out because Homo sapiens just like out

316
00:19:58,840 --> 00:20:02,240
competed them for natural resources. So it'll be like you and your Neanderthal

317
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:05,440
bros, you'd like get up and like all right time to go hunting, let's go kill a

318
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:09,480
woolly mammoth. We got our our rock with a vine around it that we swing around our

319
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:12,240
and they were at the man, they're just using their hands. Literally, it's like

320
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:15,760
it's like it's like the movie where it's like a movie where the big company

321
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:19,680
comes in and and and fucks up the like little, a little bit small business.

322
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:22,880
The humans show up to the mammoth hunt. There's a bunch of homo sapiens and

323
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:26,520
they got swords and shit yeah and they're they're full night. You're

324
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:29,400
fucked. They're not killing you, but they're they're getting all the stuff

325
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:33,560
they definitely killed. They killed. They also interbred, I think. Oh, they

326
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:36,600
were interbred. Can you imagine having can you imagine

327
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:39,220
damn

328
00:20:39,220 --> 00:20:40,960
crate

329
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:49,380
into bread. That was a really fucking good one. Can you imagine having a

330
00:20:49,380 --> 00:20:54,320
situation where it's like it's possible and I won't say acceptable, but it's

331
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:57,920
possible for you to be like damn, I'm a fuck someone of a different speed.

332
00:20:57,920 --> 00:21:03,080
I'm just be like sitting around with your boys at the bar and be like damn

333
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:04,040
like I'm really into

334
00:21:05,820 --> 00:21:09,860
yeah, what's your type man? I hate to bring it back to our other species. I

335
00:21:09,860 --> 00:21:13,020
hate to bring it back to explain. No, I don't, but you love to that is

336
00:21:13,020 --> 00:21:16,860
definitely there's definitely a mutant chaser type of guy. Well, where is the

337
00:21:16,860 --> 00:21:22,660
where is the the family like where's the family comedy or something right homo

338
00:21:22,660 --> 00:21:26,340
superior, where is the family comedy about the the homo sapien bringing in

339
00:21:26,340 --> 00:21:30,300
their Neanderthal Christmas dinner is that in crude? No, but it could be

340
00:21:30,300 --> 00:21:33,580
crude five. They carry in the Henderson. Oh, that's a big foot. Yeah,

341
00:21:34,420 --> 00:21:37,780
yeah, that's a good idea. That's a great idea. I think yes, who's come

342
00:21:37,780 --> 00:21:39,060
guess

343
00:21:39,060 --> 00:21:44,900
guess

344
00:21:44,900 --> 00:21:50,420
yes,

345
00:21:50,420 --> 00:21:51,980
to dimper.

346
00:21:51,980 --> 00:21:54,420
It's a great idea.

347
00:21:54,420 --> 00:21:56,820
That's a really, really good

348
00:21:56,820 --> 00:21:59,300
subtitles. Yeah,

349
00:22:00,420 --> 00:22:05,120
well, no, the homo sapien speaks just english. He's just like a guy with the

350
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:10,320
like my favorite vest on my favorite neanderthal fact is back when they first

351
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:14,700
were discovering neanderthals. The early scientific name for them was homo

352
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:15,640
stupidus

353
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:20,700
and they changed it. They were like all you stupid homo.

354
00:22:20,700 --> 00:22:23,620
I didn't know science had

355
00:22:23,620 --> 00:22:26,100
I didn't know science had a name for you.

356
00:22:26,100 --> 00:22:27,980
Homo stupidus

357
00:22:30,180 --> 00:22:35,700
the academic papers. We discovered homo stupidus yep and they're like now he's

358
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:36,660
right next to me.

359
00:22:36,660 --> 00:22:41,820
That's an amazing yeah. Homos stupid is is awesome. Is that one of those things

360
00:22:41,820 --> 00:22:46,440
where I mean that's clearly latin, but maybe a guy was named homo stupidus and

361
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:51,600
they named him after that guy yeah stupidus john stupidus yeah or the guy's

362
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:54,620
name was not homo stupidus and they were like this name named after you.

363
00:22:54,620 --> 00:22:56,600
I know they

364
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:02,000
he's really named after they were the old scientific names. They got to bring that

365
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:05,280
style back man nowadays, it's all naming them after people, but back in the day,

366
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:10,800
fuck all that, like grizzly bears, their name is ursus something horribilis. I

367
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:15,200
like that, that's great, it should all be like that horribilis, horribilis,

368
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:20,720
which I think that of bears is extremely cute, yeah, but not grizzlies man, I've

369
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:23,960
been seeing these even grizzly, they have hunchbacks like quasimodo, my grandma

370
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:28,920
a hunchback like Quasimodo? I saw that bear. That bear video. What bear? Where the lady

371
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:34,740
gets a, the bear has like a deli cup stuck on its head and she takes the deli cup off

372
00:23:34,740 --> 00:23:40,360
of the bear's head and then the bear brings his mom to her house and keeps trying to like,

373
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:46,080
like, just like showing, the cub is showing his mom just like, this lady's, this is my

374
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:50,640
OG right here. This lady took the cup off my head? This lady took the cup off my head.

375
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:53,840
change my number. Well, what is the prayer mom? I want her to be my new mom.

376
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:57,440
What if it was a punishment? Maybe yeah and the moms coming over, let

377
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:08,540
I'd be pretty pissed if I was the mama yeah, they're taking my kid ever take a

378
00:24:08,540 --> 00:24:12,280
cup off of that. I can imagine some I can imagine a Karen in a restaurant

379
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:14,740
saying that like she's sitting down. She goes to the bathroom. She leaves her

380
00:24:14,740 --> 00:24:18,240
her toddler at the table and with a cup on his head, a waiter comes over and

381
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:19,240
takes the cup. I know it's

382
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:19,740
how

383
00:24:19,740 --> 00:24:24,340
that'd be a bad punishment.

384
00:24:24,340 --> 00:24:25,240
I

385
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:30,540
hate that we need to bring back cool punishments for kids, because like what

386
00:24:30,540 --> 00:24:35,840
will like glue your hands to your head or yeah, it needs to be more. I don't

387
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:39,940
know it needs to be more. You do something you borrow soap as a classic

388
00:24:39,940 --> 00:24:43,640
bar. It's a good example. It should be, you know, things stuff. I had to borrow

389
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:46,840
soap as a kid. I got that. I would swear. I think I got the bar soap. Maybe

390
00:24:46,840 --> 00:24:51,240
once. I had to use Listerine because my mom knew that I hated Listerine so

391
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:51,680
badly.

392
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:54,800
That's weird. Well, it burns my

393
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:56,080
my most

394
00:24:56,080 --> 00:25:01,600
means it's working. The punishment kid memory I have the most is that my dad, I

395
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:04,880
forget what I even did, but my dad was like I'm gonna, I had a bunch of little

396
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:08,480
like Pokemon figurines of different Pokemon. I like a bunch of them that I

397
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:12,280
would play with and my dad was like, oh, like you did this whatever I'm gonna

398
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:16,400
take away your favourite Pokemon toy and I would be like I was like, oh, my

399
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:18,240
my favorites a meow

400
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:22,540
the lamest one

401
00:25:22,540 --> 00:25:24,500
or

402
00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:25,760
fucking

403
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:30,520
doing the worst, the worst lie of all time and him completely knowing which

404
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:33,920
one is my favorite. Yeah, I try to pass it up like no. This one's my

405
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:34,480
favorite

406
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:41,280
please yeah. I feel like I'm going to be probably seeing right through that with

407
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:45,160
my kid yeah sure yeah as a kid. You always think you're a genius and then I

408
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:48,000
feel like you think back and you're like, oh yeah, yeah, I used to think that I'd

409
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:52,840
be able to hide myself in the love seat. Like I would, I would, that's different.

410
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:55,360
I would, I would think I thought that I was so, so

411
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:58,880
and you're like, I thought I could fit inside the

412
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:05,160
I thought that I could, I would position my body so that it, I thought that I

413
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:09,500
would looked like a cushion when I did this and I would like you'd go under the

414
00:26:09,500 --> 00:26:13,720
cushion. No, I would be in the middle of the chair and I would try to see how

415
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:15,840
if I could cover the whole

416
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:21,320
cushion of the love seat, it was like it's not a love. See, it's more like a

417
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:25,240
chair. You thought you were a salamander. I thought that I could look like a

418
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:28,640
cushion and every single time my mom would walk in and say, what the fuck are

419
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:30,360
you doing? You thought you were doing the scene from Lord of the Rings where

420
00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:33,280
they become a rock. Yes. What are you talking about? I still don't understand.

421
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:37,360
You thought you could look like a cushion. He just explained it. He thought

422
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:40,280
he was like covering himself up or did you cover yourself up with a blanket or

423
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:42,640
anything? I think so, yeah. Yeah, you know, like you've seen Lord of the Rings

424
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:46,100
how they become a rock. You thought you had active camo? Yes. I could imagine

425
00:26:46,100 --> 00:26:49,540
be thinking that as a kid. I'm sure I thought something similar. I was probably

426
00:26:49,540 --> 00:26:53,440
five or six. Sixteen, seventeen? That's not... Yeah, five or sixteen.

427
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:57,660
That's not... Anywhere between five to sixteen, I tried this. You were a quite

428
00:26:57,660 --> 00:27:01,520
dumb child. I was very dumb. I mean, I told you before I got my head stuck

429
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:02,560
in a reclining chair.

430
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:07,680
Get the hell away from these chairs, bitch. You are not allowed to touch the

431
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:10,000
chairs anymore. I don't think there's any chair. There is a chair in my

432
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:17,400
house and I do sit in it now because I think I've got a chair. I was going to

433
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:23,280
say there's no like sofa type chairs. I used to think I definitely conquered the

434
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:29,720
chair. My grandpa had a lazy boy. You do your damn chores. He's not his grandpa's

435
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:35,760
boy. I'm his grand boy. What's this Listerine? Don't even after I say that I

436
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:39,280
was after I say that I was tortured with Listerine as a child. You pull out a

437
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:42,960
Listerine thing you want one. I'll take one after we're unless I do something

438
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:47,600
bad coffee. Okay. If I say something bad, then you can give me some. I'll have

439
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:51,480
these on reserve. Okay. Thank you. My dad has my dad smells like those all day.

440
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:54,360
Yeah. Yeah. Because he pops them like like they're nothing. That's what I've

441
00:27:54,360 --> 00:27:59,200
been doing. Yeah. I bought these in this one. I don't got I had to I had to I got

442
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:03,120

451
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:32,960
the next level, but anyway, I had to fast for it and I could part of the

452
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:36,400
fast is you can't even chew gum. I'm supposed to chew gum. I don't know

00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:46,740
have a strenuous exercise? Yeah, wine is good for you. Wine is alcohol, by the

456
00:28:46,740 --> 00:28:47,000
way,

457
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:52,420
and no chewing gum, even if you made me it gave me the most clear moment of

458
00:28:52,420 --> 00:28:55,980
lucidity in my life that guys right now I'm completely addicted to chewing gum.

459
00:28:55,980 --> 00:29:01,640
You are I remember addicted to chewing gum so badly, so hopelessly addicted. I

460
00:29:01,700 --> 00:29:06,300
went. I full guy quitting cigarettes reached for a piece of gum and had to

461
00:29:06,300 --> 00:29:10,940
say no ten times yeah like over the like you know this is like in the fast. The

462
00:29:10,940 --> 00:29:14,860
fast is like probably total like three hours of being awake time. I mean like

463
00:29:14,860 --> 00:29:17,460
it's not like I'm like all day. It's like right before I go to bed, I'm

464
00:29:17,460 --> 00:29:21,100
reach for the goat. No, we're going to pierce a show and I was at your house

465
00:29:21,100 --> 00:29:25,780
and your fiance was asking you about the gum and you said this is the last two

466
00:29:25,780 --> 00:29:30,060
pieces and then you pulled out another big thirty six. You have the briefcase.

467
00:29:30,100 --> 00:29:32,800
he has the briefcase. It's not a briefcase. It's a cylinder. Yeah,

468
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:33,520
that's so he is the

469
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:36,400
they make briefcase. You've never seen the

470
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:39,940
really long ones. You can get a Costco. I'm going to get that. Yeah,

471
00:29:39,940 --> 00:29:43,960
I got to say, do we have the other day? Julio? I joined a discord call with

472
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:47,160
Julio and he said I said I was chewing. I forgot. I was said something about

473
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:50,200
gum and he said you don't like gum and I made me so mad. I turned on my

474
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:51,400
camera and I had like four

475
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:57,360
in front of me. I was showing them all to him that I saw your gum desk,

476
00:29:57,400 --> 00:29:58,400
Dude, I saw it.

477
00:29:58,400 --> 00:29:59,400
That is a 12-year-old's addiction.

478
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:00,400
I'm hopelessly...

479
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:01,400
Yeah.

480
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:03,400
Well, I'm glad I'm not addicted to Zen.

481
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:06,000
You need to get addicted to something even better than that.

482
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,040
No, I like gum, man.

483
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:09,440
You're going to like my thumb.

484
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:11,120
I like your thumb already.

485
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:12,120
Really?

486
00:30:12,120 --> 00:30:13,120
Chew on it.

487
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:14,120
It's fine.

488
00:30:14,120 --> 00:30:15,120
But it's so ugly.

489
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:16,120
It's not that bad.

490
00:30:16,120 --> 00:30:17,120
Chew on his thumb.

491
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:18,120
Look at this thumb.

492
00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:19,120
It's not that bad.

493
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:20,120
Look at this one.

494
00:30:20,120 --> 00:30:21,120
Look at my slender thumb.

495
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:22,120
Oh, my God.

496
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:23,120
You have a slim thumb.

497
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:24,120
I have a cut from my cat.

498
00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:25,120
Slim thumb, mother-thumber.

499
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:31,600
car and it's making an X stop crazy stop. Don't even say what I think you will

500
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:31,940
say

501
00:30:31,940 --> 00:30:38,520
you're not going to say it right. Charles Xavier would not fuck with you. By the

502
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:42,040
way, in real life, he would literally listen to the last episode and hear

503
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:44,400
what you said about people in wheelchairs. He would call you. I say

504
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:48,800
about which that's behind paywall. So if you're not subscribe, no, you can't give

505
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:52,760
any detail. You won't know what he said. No, no, no, no, no, that it was bad. I

506
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:57,920
said okay, let me clear the air. I Caleb said that people in wheelchairs have

507
00:30:57,920 --> 00:31:03,060
Ganondorf powers for some reason, and I said I'm crazy. I don't know. I don't

508
00:31:03,060 --> 00:31:07,220
remember why reason. I don't remember why, but Caleb said they have some

509
00:31:07,220 --> 00:31:12,800
hidden Ganondorf power and then they become Ganon and I said yes, stay a pig.

510
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:16,720
You said go back to be. You said you would see someone in a wheelchair stand

511
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:20,900
up and say go back to being a pig because I got I got confused. I forgot

512
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:23,960
that when Ganondorf becomes Ganon, he becomes a pig.

513
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:26,960
Nobody knows what you're talking about. Ganon is a...

514
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:30,360
They will know what I'm talking about. Ganondorf is from Super Smash Brothers.

515
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:33,760
Yeah, and Ganondorf is the man. Ganondorf is a super punch. Ganondorf is the man.

516
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:38,360
Ganon is the pig creature. I don't know what the fuck you're talking...

517
00:31:38,360 --> 00:31:42,360
Ganon... Shut the hell up. Ganon is a pig creature. No. You've become a nerd.

518
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:45,760
You've become a full nerd. I have become... You're talking about X-Men and

519
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:50,160
Ganondorf, man. That's hardly a pig. That's a pig. Okay, a hog. What kind of...

520
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:56,200
he's got who I'll give you that he's kind of hogs got hooves and hands. He's a

521
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:59,840
hog. Nobody has hands and hooves. Oh, well, you said he has hooves like that

522
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:05,340
was a disqualifier, but he's type of pig. That's not a pig man. That's a

523
00:32:05,340 --> 00:32:09,960
fucking limb monster type of he has a cheese sword in this picture. Yeah,

524
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:12,800
that sort is made of cheese. None of them. What goes good with him? I don't

525
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:17,360
want to look at any more pictures. No, I was a holy cheese. We're moving on to

526
00:32:17,380 --> 00:32:21,480
episode now. All right, we're done. We're done with you. All right, we can jump

527
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:28,680
right in the pig stuff. We can jump right in to today's episode, which is

528
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:29,680
okay. Go ahead and enter.

529
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:36,980
Welcome to our new our new game show that is actually adopted from an old

530
00:32:36,980 --> 00:32:42,180
game show. The price is just right. The price is just right. Right is right.

531
00:32:43,080 --> 00:32:48,040
my pride is ride. My pride is ride. My pride is right guys. Today we found some

532
00:32:48,040 --> 00:32:48,840
funny ass

533
00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:54,760
listings for items to buy on the internet, but we're hiding the prices

534
00:32:54,760 --> 00:32:59,920
from each other and we're gonna see if we can guess the price. Oh my God, this

535
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:03,680
is an amazing idea. I'm pretty excited for this. I found some good stuff. I

536
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:07,440
mean, I could go first. If you guys do this, let's just go into order of tabs.

537
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:12,200
Okay. All right, I'll go first guys. And today I made a title slide by

538
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:17,160
I wish I did that as Julio always tells me or he always passive aggressively wants

539
00:33:17,160 --> 00:33:18,160
me to make a title slide.

540
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:19,160
That's Nickelodeon.

541
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:20,160
That's the Price is Right.

542
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:27,800
So I don't actually, I never actually watch the Price is Right or know any details about

543
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:28,800
it.

544
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:29,800
It's amazingly fucking awesome.

545
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:31,400
If I'm doing anything wrong, you guys have to tell me.

546
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:32,400
Who is Price is Right?

547
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:34,000
That was Bob Barker, not Pat Sajak.

548
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,120
Pat Sajak, I believe, became.

549
00:33:36,120 --> 00:33:37,120
No he's Wheel of Fortune.

550
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:38,120
Drew Carey became.

551
00:33:38,120 --> 00:33:39,120
Drew Carey.

552
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:43,800
On this one you have to make sure that only go to the next slide when I say next slide because you can't you're going to be

553
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:45,800
Giving away spoilers. We can't spoil nothing on this.

554
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:51,680
So let's start with our first item that you guys need to guess the price on. Can I say one thing real quick?

555
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:53,680
You can say some stuff. You can say as much as you want.

556
00:33:53,680 --> 00:33:59,640
If in the world Kayla if Cameron is Drew Carey then Julio would be his Mimi.

557
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:04,400
Who's Mimi? Okay, well that if you watch the Drew Carey show. What the hell is that?

558
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:08,600
You'll just look up Mimi Drew Carey show and you'll know. No. No.

559
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:14,000
so okay, let's take a look at our first item from ebay guys all right. This

560
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:19,860
next slide, please. This is an item called slime types, fluffy foam and

561
00:34:19,860 --> 00:34:24,560
normal. Okay, so brand new or best offer with free shipping, and I got multiple

562
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:27,300
I mean you can analyze this as much as you want, but I got multiple slides

563
00:34:27,300 --> 00:34:30,920
people listening. This is a I just want to say what this what this item is.

564
00:34:30,920 --> 00:34:36,040
It's a rubber made Tupperware with it looks like some kind of white

565
00:34:36,720 --> 00:34:40,060
oobleck type thing. Right. It is mostly... And let's hit next slide here,

566
00:34:40,060 --> 00:34:42,380
so you can see some more pictures that are included with this listing,

567
00:34:42,380 --> 00:34:45,220
and you can describe these to the listeners. Let's see the next slime.

568
00:34:45,220 --> 00:34:48,560
Oh, wait, this is multiple. So this is slime types, fluffy, foam,

569
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:51,580
and normal. So they have many of these. I think... Okay, so these are

570
00:34:51,580 --> 00:34:55,980
all... It looks like they ate Chinese food and then used the Tupperware to

571
00:34:55,980 --> 00:34:57,180
put slime into it.

572
00:34:57,180 --> 00:35:01,080
And they're all white, they kind of... Some of them have sort of a...

573
00:35:01,080 --> 00:35:03,220
Yeah, well, one is pink, but they all

574
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:08,760
are plain, except for one has sort of a fruit cake style. Yeah, jelly bean

575
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:09,240
mix in

576
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:13,620
jelly bean mode, jelly bean mode. I would say for that one, and then next

577
00:35:13,620 --> 00:35:17,020
slide here. These are the last details about this item. It's brand new,

Now guys, based on these details, what do you think the price is without going

581
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:29,580
over all together?

582
00:35:30,900 --> 00:35:35,440
it doesn't say every slime. I think that it's for every slime. I'm going to say

583
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:38,620
package. I think it's a package. Yeah, okay, wait. What are they? Call that

00:37:25,220 --> 00:37:25,700
that is

613
00:37:25,700 --> 00:37:30,960
wanting to mate, yeah, but is locked up and you let it fuck this. Let's look at

614
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:33,260
some more pictures here. Okay, next slide,

615
00:37:33,260 --> 00:37:35,380
the features it has are

616
00:37:35,380 --> 00:37:39,540
simulate appearance, which is again censored. That is a

617
00:37:39,540 --> 00:37:42,500
flesh light hole for a dog, pussy

618
00:37:42,500 --> 00:37:49,060
simulated rabbit hair and a suction cup base. This is known as a mating sexual

619
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:53,700
companion. Okay, so this is for like a dog breeder. Yeah, which is crazy.

620
00:37:53,700 --> 00:37:56,860
It's about it's not for a dog breeder. This is for your dog who is frustrated

621
00:37:56,860 --> 00:38:00,680
and tries to legs all the time. This feels to me like maybe a cover up yeah

622
00:38:00,680 --> 00:38:03,500
now let's go to the next slide here. Let me read you the description. Here's

623
00:38:03,500 --> 00:38:04,360
some more pictures

624
00:38:04,360 --> 00:38:12,460
of it in use. Here's the description. No lubricants is not included. One dogs

625
00:38:12,460 --> 00:38:16,340
with estrous behavior at home, holding legs, riding over dolls, making love to

626
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:20,060
the air, etcetera. Only chasing female dogs outside and not estrous behavior at

627
00:38:20,060 --> 00:38:25,060
home are not recommended to buy to dog. Cannot be too stupid if your dog belongs

628
00:38:25,060 --> 00:38:28,740
to what cannot teach a few years will not be fixed to the kind of toilet. Do

629
00:38:28,740 --> 00:38:32,860
not recommend to buy okay three. The host needs to be patient. Dogs are

630
00:38:32,860 --> 00:38:36,140
emotional creatures, too, and mating doesn't happen all the time. It may not

631
00:38:36,140 --> 00:38:39,420
be used on the spot, but dogs with estrous behavior will use it sooner or

632
00:38:39,420 --> 00:38:43,420
later under the patient guidance of their owners. And now to the thing you

633
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:46,840
we spoke about about a cover up. I'd like to this next slide is like to read a

634
00:38:46,840 --> 00:38:51,200
review from this four stars color khaki. The one in the photo looks bigger than

635
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:55,560
the one I got might be a little too small for my dog as he is bigger than

636
00:38:55,560 --> 00:38:55,880
this.

637
00:38:55,880 --> 00:39:02,640
This is really, truly so guys, I'm going to tell you also this is this. I'm

638
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:06,200
going to tell you what the it's on sale. It's on sale sixty eight percent off,

639
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:10,960
so you're you're looking for the current the sale price. I think that this also

640
00:39:11,320 --> 00:39:15,340
one thing on this is I think this might be a new leader for number one worst

641
00:39:15,340 --> 00:39:16,780
thing to be reincarnated as

642
00:39:16,780 --> 00:39:21,860
in your next life. If you wake up and you're you can't move and you have four

643
00:39:21,860 --> 00:39:25,800
limbs and their suction cup to the ground, you're in for a very rough one.

644
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:31,240
This is going to be this is a ten dollar item on sale from seventy dollars.

645
00:39:31,240 --> 00:39:36,160
I'm going to say the original dollars locked in. I'm going to say the original

646
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:39,960
price. You don't have to guess the original well, but if it's sixty eight

647
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,200
well if it's sixty eight percent off, I might as well get twelve. Ninety I'm

648
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:45,980
going to get the original price twelve ninety eight okay. Original price was

649
00:39:45,980 --> 00:39:51,440
two hundred current prices, eighty four or no thirty. You said sixty eight off

650
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:54,320
yeah okay, then thirty four sixty four

651
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:59,960
choosing you guys choose a number four dollars that's locked in okay, all

652
00:39:59,960 --> 00:40:01,120
right, Patrick,

653
00:40:01,120 --> 00:40:07,620
you were not that close, but you did not go over. Oh Caleb, you've gone over

654
00:40:07,640 --> 00:40:11,480
the price. It was forty eight fifty one, the original price one hundred and

655
00:40:11,480 --> 00:40:15,220
fifty five dollars and fifty three cents. God man, I had a better guess

656
00:40:15,220 --> 00:40:19,040
and that's pretty cheap. If anyone wants to buy one of these to use for their

657
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:19,620
dog,

658
00:40:19,620 --> 00:40:27,280
that's I guarantee that's what that review that is so bad, pretty terrible.

659
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:31,960
All right, let's go to a more normal one. Okay, next slide, please eyes on

664
00:40:49,060 --> 00:40:53,180
they're not khakis they're navies. Well, this is a pair of navy chino pants. I

665
00:40:53,180 --> 00:40:57,660
guess the price I saw that's a that's like a department store brand. I'm going

666
00:40:57,660 --> 00:40:59,000
to say this is

667
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:05,180
forty five ninety nine. These are and I'm going to use my clothing brain. These

668
00:41:05,180 --> 00:41:05,860
are probably

669
00:41:05,860 --> 00:41:09,900
twenty five ninety nine okay,

670
00:41:09,900 --> 00:41:12,800
let's reveal the price

671
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:18,740
one hundred and seventy six thousand two hundred and three dollars and five

672
00:41:18,740 --> 00:41:24,180
cents. So Caleb you were closer, but you're a little off. I'll take the

673
00:41:24,180 --> 00:41:30,000
point. Listen, I was playing to win not playing the exact right. I knew that

674
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,460
again. These are still up on eBay. Anybody wants to go by these? It's an

675
00:41:32,500 --> 00:41:38,040
busy transaction. So you know does it come with the guy? I think it must come

676
00:41:38,040 --> 00:41:42,640
with the guy to come with a guy for that price yeah of new friend all right

677
00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:49,280
here's the here's the next ebay item. This is talky ball. Okay, wait, this is

678
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:54,320
an ebay bid. This is a talky ball and this is next slide. Please item

679
00:41:54,320 --> 00:41:57,820
description from the seller. I was opening a bag of talkies and found this.

680
00:41:57,820 --> 00:42:00,520
I was thinking of eating it, but I thought I could auction it. So yeah,

681
00:42:00,760 --> 00:42:04,020
some ideas for it, you can put it in a grinder and have Taki seasoning or

682
00:42:04,020 --> 00:42:08,380
whatever you want. This is $10 starting bid. Yeah, we're guessing starting

683
00:42:08,380 --> 00:42:14,420
starting bid. Oh man, I'm gonna say I will say $20. I think that this is a

684
00:42:14,420 --> 00:42:16,040
novelty spice. Okay,

685
00:42:16,040 --> 00:42:17,700
Caleb

686
00:42:17,700 --> 00:42:19,540
shit,

687
00:42:19,540 --> 00:42:21,020
Patrick. Oh,

688
00:42:21,020 --> 00:42:25,260
it was $4. It was $4. That's a good deal. I would have

689
00:42:25,260 --> 00:42:29,620
a talky ball, a talky ball. He's right. You could grind that. Okay, but what

690
00:42:29,620 --> 00:42:30,340
about this one?

691
00:42:30,340 --> 00:42:36,440
Black talky chip rare guys. This is a black talky chip that looks like poop.

692
00:42:36,440 --> 00:42:41,420
Yeah, it looks like it looks like goose poop. How did you find this? I search

693
00:42:41,420 --> 00:42:41,940
talky

694
00:42:41,940 --> 00:42:48,600
here's the item description for this one guys black talky chip rare condition is

695
00:42:48,600 --> 00:42:53,160
new shipped with USPS ground advantage, not new. I'm going to guess ten dollars

696
00:42:53,160 --> 00:42:58,180
again. What would it be in a pose? I mean like he's like used to put it in his

697
00:42:58,180 --> 00:42:58,580
mouth

698
00:42:58,580 --> 00:42:59,080
I'm

699
00:42:59,080 --> 00:43:04,840
it's basically new. It just looks like a burnt chip. Yeah. How much do you think

700
00:43:04,840 --> 00:43:06,460
it's worth? It's rare ten dollars

701
00:43:06,460 --> 00:43:11,100
starting to like you're trying to lead me astray by saying it's rare because

702
00:43:11,100 --> 00:43:14,500
anything that's rare should be over a hundred dollars. I don't think that

703
00:43:14,500 --> 00:43:16,940
somebody's paying a hundred bucks or even thinking that somebody will pay a

704
00:43:16,940 --> 00:43:21,300
hundred dollars for a black chip. So I am going to say

705
00:43:21,300 --> 00:43:26,780
seventy five dollars seventy five dollars. Yeah, okay, Caleb,

706
00:43:28,020 --> 00:43:32,860
you are the closest. It is three hundred dollars guys. This is a rare black chip.

707
00:43:32,860 --> 00:43:36,780
It's three hundred dollars. What do you do with that? You just eat it. You put

708
00:43:36,780 --> 00:43:37,460
it in frame

709
00:43:37,460 --> 00:43:42,240
in a black plastic bag. Yeah, I would want to know you know what I would cover

710
00:43:42,240 --> 00:43:45,440
it in resin. You know what I would do is I would take this and I would take it to

711
00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:50,240
a testing facility to find out what was in this chip. Yeah, because that is not

712
00:43:50,240 --> 00:43:54,600
pure talky seasoning. I can tell by the color. So this next one moving on from

713
00:43:54,620 --> 00:43:59,220

fifty dollars. Okay,

725
00:44:43,780 --> 00:44:50,500
I am going to make a tactical move. Okay, all right, because I know where

726
00:44:50,540 --> 00:44:55,540
this came from. This is on eBay. They have a section called metaphysical. Yes, and

727
00:44:55,540 --> 00:44:59,340
which is an amazing discovery. I had no idea that they had a metaphysical

728
00:44:59,340 --> 00:45:02,580
section and I scrolled through the metaphysical section and they were

729
00:45:02,580 --> 00:45:06,820
exorbitantly priced, I would say. A lot of items like this. So you already said

730
00:45:06,820 --> 00:45:10,420
four fifty. I'm off. I don't know exactly what the price was. I know it's going to

731
00:45:10,420 --> 00:45:15,340
be high. I will say four hundred and fifty one dollars. Wow, okay. And we need

732
00:45:15,340 --> 00:45:19,700
to we need to take turns with first bids because this is I'm I'm tricking you

733
00:45:19,740 --> 00:45:24,500
every time yeah yeah, I pretty much I'm winning for so Caleb, your cheating

734
00:45:24,500 --> 00:45:29,980
strategy has paid off. Yes, this price is fourteen hundred dollars, yes for

735
00:45:29,980 --> 00:45:33,980
basically every power available in the world. It seems like an amazing deal

736
00:45:33,980 --> 00:45:39,560
also so guys, this is my last item. This next one, okay, this is a domain name

737
00:45:39,560 --> 00:45:46,000
mister dapper dot com premium domain name from my things to sale twenty four

738
00:45:46,060 --> 00:45:51,600
seven, you can buy the domain name MrDapper.com. What do you think it is

739
00:45:51,600 --> 00:45:57,100
worth to have a website called MrDapper.com? Okay, so I have to guess

740
00:45:57,100 --> 00:46:02,220
first this time. I will say MrDapper.com is going to be

741
00:46:02,220 --> 00:46:06,060
$7,000. Okay. Okay. Well,

742
00:46:06,060 --> 00:46:12,380
I'm gonna say 7,001 because of free local pickup.

743
00:46:13,020 --> 00:46:18,460
Okay, it has free local pickup, so it's definitely around there or this could be

744
00:46:18,460 --> 00:46:20,460
you know what I'm going to say actually

745
00:46:20,460 --> 00:46:27,600
I'm locking in at one million really okay, Patrick

746
00:46:31,100 --> 00:46:33,100
eleven million dollars,

747
00:46:33,100 --> 00:46:38,020
eleven million three hundred and twenty nine thousand two hundred dollars.

748
00:46:38,020 --> 00:46:39,020
My God,

749
00:46:39,020 --> 00:46:42,580
you won with a million dollar guess.

750
00:46:42,580 --> 00:46:48,560
Wow, it's too good of a sight. You guys think Mr. Dapper dot com is worth

751
00:46:48,560 --> 00:46:52,740
eleven point three million. Absolutely. You create a streaming service with

752
00:46:52,740 --> 00:46:56,980
for sure, with all kinds of just movies for dapper men. Make your money back

753
00:46:57,000 --> 00:47:04,000
that one. Every Hitchcock movie on Mr. Dapper, every James Bond on Mr. Dapper. Oh my god.

754
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:09,880
Or it could be like Mr. Skin and it's a website of just guys looking good in movies. Yeah.

755
00:47:09,880 --> 00:47:15,880
Guys looking smart. Every time that an actor wore a suit in a movie. It tells you what

756
00:47:15,880 --> 00:47:22,040
suit they're wearing. Yeah, I think that's a good idea. Okay, so Mr. Dapper.com was much

757
00:47:22,040 --> 00:47:25,240
much more expensive than I thought. All right. Well, here is my oh my God, I'm

758
00:47:25,240 --> 00:47:27,080

00:48:15,880 --> 00:48:21,080

769
00:48:21,080 --> 00:48:26,760
price tag on the reason on the secondary market. I'm going to go four dollars

770
00:48:26,760 --> 00:48:30,360
Cameron,

771
00:48:30,360 --> 00:48:31,600

773
00:48:38,440 --> 00:48:42,240

774
00:48:42,280 --> 00:48:46,680
line going over yeah, but I went over over yes. So Cameron loses,

775
00:48:46,680 --> 00:48:47,560
because he went more over.

776
00:48:47,560 --> 00:48:52,440

are

791
00:49:46,280 --> 00:49:50,560
those are that bracelet on the right is a seasick one. Yeah, so he probably

793

one dollar. That is a really safe guess for Timu. I guess if I line dollar

798
00:50:17,280 --> 00:50:17,880
Caleb

799
00:50:17,880 --> 00:50:22,280

Sam for my Sam is retired.

814
00:51:14,480 --> 00:51:15,600
What

815
00:51:15,600 --> 00:51:20,800
I will I will give you this piece of information. Okay,

816
00:51:20,800 --> 00:51:26,780
it was not sold and the bidding is over, so we can still contact this

817
00:51:26,780 --> 00:51:29,280
private seller. You can contact this private seller. Yes, and this is we're

818
00:51:29,320 --> 00:51:32,820
guessing the starting bid or the because it was not sold me. There was there was

819
00:51:32,820 --> 00:51:36,520
one high. You're guessing the highest bid. Okay, how was it not? Yeah, how was

820
00:51:36,520 --> 00:51:39,620
it? Not? I don't know. I don't know. They probably the reserve price. Yeah,

821
00:51:39,620 --> 00:51:44,020
probably. Okay. Okay. Does it say what the reserve price is? Yeah, it says it

822
00:51:44,020 --> 00:51:47,620
says what the high bid was. So guess the high bid. So he doesn't know what a

823
00:51:47,620 --> 00:51:50,520
reserve price is. No, I don't know. We shouldn't hear the reserve price. I feel

824
00:51:50,520 --> 00:51:53,720
like no. Okay, the highest bid for this.

825
00:51:53,720 --> 00:51:58,320
It's going to be kind of low. I feel like if it's if it didn't meet the

826
00:51:58,320 --> 00:52:04,540
reserve. So I'm going to say three hundred and fifty dollars. Okay, three fifty and locking

827
00:52:04,540 --> 00:52:14,400
in and twenty five cents. Okay. Damn, you know, I'm going to try and undercut here.

828
00:52:14,400 --> 00:52:18,980
I'm going to go two hundred dollars. I'm feeling I'm feeling the two hundred two hundred. You

829
00:52:18,980 --> 00:52:22,600
want to lock in. I want to I would like to lock in two hundred dollars. You're both locked

830
00:52:22,600 --> 00:52:26,840
in target. I'm locked in three hundred and twenty five cents, two hundred

831
00:52:26,840 --> 00:52:28,400

to both to both of you. No way. Both of you. It was one hundred dollars.

833
00:52:35,800 --> 00:52:42,000
No one really wanted this. No one wanted this bad enough. I bet three. I bet

834
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:46,080
two hundred was the reserve. I mean, I would have paid that. No question. Yeah,

835
00:52:46,080 --> 00:52:49,120
that's crazy. But this is that's the other thing. You could just get this

836
00:52:49,120 --> 00:52:54,480
anywhere. What no, not one that you want on one body. That's true yeah and has

00:53:40,340 --> 00:53:44,100
huge swing. That is a huge swing. That's a massive. Let's split the difference

849
00:53:44,100 --> 00:53:45,700
eight thousand okay.

850
00:53:45,700 --> 00:53:51,700
I this looks really good. If I just saw this picture, if I didn't get the

851
00:53:51,700 --> 00:53:52,260
description,

852
00:53:52,260 --> 00:53:56,140
I would go crazy high on this and the reason is because it looks like a

853
00:53:56,140 --> 00:53:59,540
mission impossible to mask yeah yeah that maybe I could put it on and I could

854
00:53:59,540 --> 00:54:01,740
walk around and people might think I'm depp, but

855
00:54:01,740 --> 00:54:05,900
I can't. I have a head already. I can't put this on top of my head and walk

856
00:54:05,900 --> 00:54:09,420
around and be a depp. I mean I get, but then I have it all depp, but then

857
00:54:09,460 --> 00:54:12,980
people know his body. I know he's tall. He's not that tall. He doesn't have a

858
00:54:12,980 --> 00:54:18,660
long neck, long head, head, thickness, torso. I am gonna say

859
00:54:18,660 --> 00:54:27,460
I'm gonna say, I'm gonna say $1800 and $75 as well. 1800 and you were

860
00:54:27,460 --> 00:54:33,980
I feel like there's no way I'm right. What was your 8000? 8000, 1500, 1700.

861
00:54:33,980 --> 00:54:37,000
I think I have to have gone over, I think.

862
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:44,640
Oh my God, it was ten thousand nine hundred thirteen thousand would have

863
00:54:44,640 --> 00:54:48,180
been too much. Yeah, I felt it course through me. I felt Johnny Depp spirit

864
00:54:48,180 --> 00:54:51,440
that in my body, the curse of the black Pearl. Oh my God, went to

865
00:54:51,440 --> 00:54:55,480
have this from Zinga. You had this from Zinga worldwide. Yeah, I see. Yeah.

866
00:54:55,480 --> 00:54:59,000
All right, this next, this is another thing from eBay. This is

867
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:05,920
Bill Cosby signed Academy Awards, eleven by fourteen photo JSA. Okay, I bid

868
00:55:05,960 --> 00:55:12,100
first right yeah here's what I would pay for this zero. My guess is zero you're

869
00:55:12,100 --> 00:55:16,920
gonna lock in a zero zero okay one cent okay. I do one cent one cent and two

870
00:55:16,920 --> 00:55:20,680
cents. You know what I'm standing on my principles, so I'm fine with losing. I'm

871
00:55:20,680 --> 00:55:23,680
sitting on business. Okay, well, Cameron was closest

872
00:55:23,680 --> 00:55:31,480
the serial rapist

873
00:55:32,760 --> 00:55:36,760
but some people I mean some people are in stuff like that Jeffrey Dahmer and

874
00:55:36,760 --> 00:55:38,120
Kemper Bill,

875
00:55:38,120 --> 00:55:40,040
Cosby

876
00:55:40,040 --> 00:55:45,580
yeah, they're all one in the same nowadays. I think he's trying to think

877
00:55:45,580 --> 00:55:48,680
of the other guy. I can't remember his name. Well, while you're thinking about

878
00:55:48,680 --> 00:55:52,760
that, the people have tons of Freddy, Freddy Krueger hand and so people buy

879
00:55:52,760 --> 00:55:56,640
this shit all the time. Ted Bundy. Oh yeah, all right, while you're thinking

880
00:55:56,640 --> 00:56:00,620
of the or will you already so I can plankton this next item

881
00:56:01,560 --> 00:56:06,360
seven and one sixteenths inches mega monster. That's a record size museum

882
00:56:06,360 --> 00:56:10,200
fossil teeth. Is it is it confirmed to be? Yeah, do we know if it's a replica?

883
00:56:10,200 --> 00:56:15,140
I will say right now that this is from New York Island fossils. Okay, so

884
00:56:15,140 --> 00:56:19,320
probably probably real. I mean these are expensive. I'm well, it's your guess

885
00:56:19,320 --> 00:56:22,280
first. Yeah, okay, well, why don't you just say what yours is first just to

886
00:56:22,280 --> 00:56:27,240
okay one dollar. Oh, okay, you know I'll probably go two hundred and fifty

887
00:56:27,280 --> 00:56:31,880
thousand dollars and half of a cent two hundred two hundred fifty. Really? It's

888
00:56:31,880 --> 00:56:33,520
big man. It's a fossil. I mean, I

889
00:56:33,520 --> 00:56:37,720
yeah, you know what? I already said it. I guess you alright to fifty. I'm going to

890
00:56:37,720 --> 00:56:40,640
go eleven hundred dollars eleven. Oh really? Yeah, I'm going to go eleven

891
00:56:40,640 --> 00:56:41,960
hundred. Wow. Well,

892
00:56:41,960 --> 00:56:43,360
Caleb,

893
00:56:43,360 --> 00:56:48,360
you were closer. It is twenty thousand dollars.

894
00:56:48,360 --> 00:56:52,520
That makes sense. Yeah, very expensive. That does make sense. I guess I was

895
00:56:52,520 --> 00:56:55,480
thinking you have no respect for ancient things. Well, you know what I'm thinking

896
00:56:55,520 --> 00:56:58,760
because I'm thinking of a great white shark tooth, but you know what the thing

897
00:56:58,760 --> 00:57:03,460
about that is it's not extinct. There's a lot of those around. That was kind of

898
00:57:03,460 --> 00:57:06,800
my reference point in my head, but I guess it makes a lot more sense for

899
00:57:06,800 --> 00:57:09,020
something that you did seventy five million years.

900
00:57:09,020 --> 00:57:14,540
Well, speaking of ancient things, your mom

901
00:57:14,540 --> 00:57:18,440
well, speaking of ancient things, you ask

902
00:57:18,440 --> 00:57:20,680
should I go with

903
00:57:24,040 --> 00:57:26,440
Should I go with the bid or the buy it now for this one?

904
00:57:26,440 --> 00:57:28,040
Let's do buy it now.

905
00:57:28,040 --> 00:57:33,040
This is worn very smelly shoes comfy brown so soft.

906
00:57:33,040 --> 00:57:39,040
Okay, I would like to say this is a pair of UGG slippers it looks like that have a

907
00:57:39,040 --> 00:57:43,040
fully matted back where they've been worn.

908
00:57:43,040 --> 00:57:44,040
Very smelly comfy brown so soft.

909
00:57:44,040 --> 00:57:45,040
These are dads.

910
00:57:45,040 --> 00:57:46,040
Yes, these are daddies.

911
00:57:46,040 --> 00:57:48,040
These are dads that he got for Christmas twelve years ago.

912
00:57:48,040 --> 00:57:51,040
And he's been stinking them up every time he gets them.

913
00:57:51,040 --> 00:57:52,040
These are the football shoes.

914
00:57:52,040 --> 00:57:53,880
But these are puffy brown so soft.

915
00:57:53,880 --> 00:57:56,180
Yeah, and I bet they are soft because they're very worn in.

916
00:57:56,180 --> 00:57:57,480
I'm going to say

917
00:57:57,480 --> 00:57:59,880
very smelly.

918
00:57:59,880 --> 00:58:01,120
Why would they add that?

919
00:58:01,120 --> 00:58:02,420
And so here's my question.

920
00:58:02,420 --> 00:58:04,220
It's a bid too. It's a bid. It's an auction.

921
00:58:04,220 --> 00:58:05,420
Yeah. Are we doing buy it now?

922
00:58:05,420 --> 00:58:06,220
Oh yeah, we're doing buy it now.

923
00:58:06,220 --> 00:58:09,400
So the very smelly makes me wonder, is that

924
00:58:09,400 --> 00:58:12,260
does that make the price lower or is it making it higher?

925
00:58:12,260 --> 00:58:13,300
I think it makes it higher.

926
00:58:13,300 --> 00:58:14,700
Yeah, makes it higher.

927
00:58:14,700 --> 00:58:15,500
Because they wouldn't. You're right.

928
00:58:15,500 --> 00:58:16,660
Because they're trying to get their money.

929
00:58:16,660 --> 00:58:17,200
Money's worth.

930
00:58:17,200 --> 00:58:20,300
They're not going to add to something like that if it devalues it.

931
00:58:20,300 --> 00:58:20,980
Right.

932
00:58:20,980 --> 00:58:25,820
So very smelly. I'm going to say that this is $75. And wait, is it just one

933
00:58:25,820 --> 00:58:29,200
shoot? No, it's two shoes. Well, from the picture, I'm guessing it's one

934
00:58:29,200 --> 00:58:32,820
shoe. But it's a shoes. Okay, I'm gonna go. You did

935
00:58:32,820 --> 00:58:38,620
75. You're locked in. I'm locking. I'm gonna go $30. $30.

936
00:58:38,620 --> 00:58:43,020
That's your final. No, you know what? I'm gonna I'm gonna gamble that you

937
00:58:43,020 --> 00:58:47,100
are just gonna blow out and go over. I'm gonna fuck. I'm gonna go $10 and

938
00:58:47,100 --> 00:58:49,100
just try and get under $10. Yeah,

939
00:58:49,940 --> 00:58:53,340
one dollar. Cameron, you already locked in ten ten dollars.

940
00:58:53,340 --> 00:58:59,500

941
00:58:59,500 --> 00:59:03,940
And what can you just send me the link for this one? Just like a very early

942
00:59:03,940 --> 00:59:06,820
because I feel like you. Yeah, just to make sure. I mean, it is a pretty

943
00:59:06,820 --> 00:59:09,700
reasonable price. Four dollars and twenty eight cents. You can clean the

944
00:59:09,700 --> 00:59:13,780
smell off. Yeah. Well, I don't somehow I feel like the people buying this are not

945
00:59:13,780 --> 00:59:16,580
buying it and I can clean the smell off and they'll be like new.

946
00:59:17,620 --> 00:59:21,820
it saves the money buying already smelly shoes, very, very smelly. These are

947
00:59:21,820 --> 00:59:26,060
comfy brown shoes. They're comfy brown. So soft. Yeah, yeah, yeah, comfy brown.

948
00:59:26,060 --> 00:59:29,220
So soft. Yeah, they're trying to flip shoes. Yeah, I have

949
00:59:29,220 --> 00:59:35,220
oh this one. I can just get rid of okay. So

950
00:59:35,220 --> 00:59:39,460
skip that. Yeah, we'll skip it when we get to it, but I'll just show it to you

951
00:59:39,460 --> 00:59:42,980
because I liked it. How many items do you have? You I have you tell me how I

952
00:59:42,980 --> 00:59:44,980
I knew the shopaholic was going to have the most items.

953
00:59:44,980 --> 00:59:46,980
I have four items.

954
00:59:46,980 --> 00:59:50,980
Okay, this next item I went to Facebook Marketplace to find.

955
00:59:50,980 --> 00:59:51,980
Oh, good.

956
00:59:51,980 --> 00:59:53,980
This is men's jockstrap.

957
00:59:53,980 --> 00:59:54,980
Oh, a leather one.

958
00:59:54,980 --> 00:59:58,980
And you can tell from the photos that this has been worn and washed.

959
00:59:58,980 --> 01:00:00,980
Used men's jockstrap.

960
01:00:00,980 --> 01:00:04,980
$35.12.7.

961
01:00:04,980 --> 01:00:07,980
Now, remember this is on Marketplace where people like to use round figures.

962
01:00:07,980 --> 01:00:09,980
Okay, free.

963
01:00:09,980 --> 01:00:15,880
interesting men jock strap free is actually a strong guess. It is. I will

964
01:00:15,880 --> 01:00:19,820
say I mean if are you locking in for you all looking for okay, then I do one

965
01:00:19,820 --> 01:00:20,140
cent.

966
01:00:20,140 --> 01:00:25,060
Well, it's just more likely to be free than one cent, but it is probably right.

967
01:00:25,060 --> 01:00:28,700
Well, I think it's fifty fifty. I don't I don't I don't it would be a nice

968
01:00:28,700 --> 01:00:30,880
trick, but I don't think it's trying to I don't think it was. No, I'm not

969
01:00:30,880 --> 01:00:34,060
trying to trick because this cost money. Well, yeah, I mean, I'll give you a hint.

970
01:00:34,060 --> 01:00:35,020
It cost money.

971
01:00:35,020 --> 01:00:39,580
I probably shouldn't guess free then no, but it's too late. You already did.

972
01:00:39,580 --> 01:00:44,380
I mean, I respect the honor of the game. I like that and you did one cent.

973
01:00:44,380 --> 01:00:47,380
Caleb

974
01:00:47,380 --> 01:00:54,780
fifteen dollars and available to deliver if local. Fifth size. Small to medium.

975
01:00:54,780 --> 01:00:58,680
That's what you're really paying for. That's not even necessarily what you're

976
01:00:58,680 --> 01:01:02,680
paying for. That is what the actual item that you're buying is. This guy shows up

977
01:01:02,680 --> 01:01:07,680
with it. Oh crap. I wore it to come deliver it. Well, it's like I got to take

978
01:01:07,680 --> 01:01:08,780
this thing off.

979
01:01:08,780 --> 01:01:13,580
this next one. I'll try to like burn through. We'll just kind of burn

980
01:01:13,580 --> 01:01:17,080
through lightning around lightning around. No, because these are cleaning

981
01:01:17,080 --> 01:01:20,380
be good. Okay. I don't have these are cleaning burns through it and I'm

982
01:01:20,380 --> 01:01:20,880
like no,

983
01:01:20,880 --> 01:01:26,680
that means go. Yeah, we'll do it. We'll do it. Well, this is beans cleaning

984
01:01:26,680 --> 01:01:31,380
beans. These blessed beans are used to clean energy and given to Mother Earth

985
01:01:31,380 --> 01:01:36,480
cleaning bit. This is bird seed. This is fully bird. Okay, I'm seeing so this

986
01:01:36,480 --> 01:01:42,180
I this is a bowl of dried beans. I'm seeing Lima. Yeah, I'm seeing kidney.

987
01:01:42,180 --> 01:01:45,520
I'm seeing black eyed pea and I'm seeing some black beans

988
01:01:45,520 --> 01:01:50,380
and you're seeing some hands blessing the beans. It looks like which is that's

989
01:01:50,380 --> 01:01:55,800
worth a lot. I would say this is this can't be more than than a dollar fifty

990
01:01:55,800 --> 01:01:58,560
worth of beans that are okay. A dollar fifty worth of beans. You're going to

991
01:01:58,560 --> 01:02:01,820
lock in at a dollar. I'm going to say a dollar fifty of beans. Okay, no,

992
01:02:01,820 --> 01:02:04,400
Cameron, what about you? You're forgetting the blessing. Yeah, they're

993
01:02:04,420 --> 01:02:08,620
lessen part of the list. I'm atheistic. I don't believe in this kind of blit. I

994
01:02:08,620 --> 01:02:10,300
don't believe in anything good. Five dollars

995
01:02:10,300 --> 01:02:14,380
because I think it's going to be more than that, but I don't want to put you

996
01:02:14,380 --> 01:02:17,920
were closer at these are ten dollars. I was going to guess ten dollars and I was

997
01:02:17,920 --> 01:02:20,700
like I don't want to go over. So I guess five and said because you went so well.

998
01:02:20,700 --> 01:02:23,980
We need to see a bullseye. I could have gotten a bullseye right there man. Ten

999
01:02:23,980 --> 01:02:27,300
dollars was in my head, but I wouldn't I would have only done. I would have done

1000
01:02:27,300 --> 01:02:30,540
ten dollars. You had done five. Yeah, all right, well, this next listing will

1001
01:02:30,560 --> 01:02:35,800
just we'll skip it, but my wife says no more. My wife says you are your guitars

1002
01:02:35,800 --> 01:02:37,040
must go to different

1003
01:02:37,040 --> 01:02:42,480
yeah. How much is the price? One of them I was going to have you guess the price

1004
01:02:42,480 --> 01:02:46,820
of each of them and a jubilee. Can you just get rid of the text boxes over the

1005
01:02:46,820 --> 01:02:47,520
prices here

1006
01:02:47,520 --> 01:02:51,780
because they are different for an interview? You can all right well, then

1007
01:02:51,780 --> 01:02:54,240
this next one I need to see this next. We'll go to the next one

1008
01:02:54,240 --> 01:03:00,440
next one. Whoa! This is podcast about list world domination t shirt from Wendy

1009
01:03:00,440 --> 01:03:04,640
premium. Okay. And Wendy premium says and I don't know if this is a

1010
01:03:04,640 --> 01:03:08,240
review or if this is the description of the item.

1011
01:03:08,240 --> 01:03:13,240
A total of 45 prosecution witnesses were called to present evidence

1012
01:03:13,240 --> 01:03:16,340
against Kelly with many of his victims including the podcast about

1013
01:03:16,340 --> 01:03:17,840
list world domination shirt.

1014
01:03:17,840 --> 01:03:21,940
Moreover, I love this singer Aaliyah who married Kelly in 1994 when

1015
01:03:21,940 --> 01:03:26,340
he was 27 and she was 15 identified as Jane does accusations of

1016
01:03:26,340 --> 01:03:29,840
engaging in sex acts with women under the age of consent followed

1017
01:03:29,840 --> 01:03:33,000
R Kelly for decades, but it took the meet to revolution in the broadcast of

1018
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:36,240
the twenty nineteen documentary say surviving R Kelly for Kelly's long

1019
01:03:36,240 --> 01:03:40,040
standing wow blah blah blah blah blah. So the description of the podcast

1020
01:03:40,040 --> 01:03:44,920
about list world domination t shirt on Wendy premium speaks about our

1021
01:03:44,920 --> 01:03:46,560
Kelly. It's the area.

1022
01:03:46,560 --> 01:03:51,060
It's the nearly our tour shirt from two years ago is one of the many

1023
01:03:51,060 --> 01:03:55,480
called to that was was one of the victims of our Kelly was called to the

1024
01:03:55,480 --> 01:03:57,840
witness stand. How much do you think

1025
01:03:58,920 --> 01:04:02,560
I do you think that that would raise or lower the price of this? I mean this

1026
01:04:02,560 --> 01:04:05,460
has to be a collector's that well, first of all, it's out of print. We don't

1027
01:04:05,460 --> 01:04:08,560
make this anymore. I don't think we actually ever made it as a hoodie. Yeah,

1028
01:04:08,560 --> 01:04:08,960
so

1029
01:04:08,960 --> 01:04:13,180
I'm first. I think I'm first. Yeah, you're first. Yeah, I mean you can go

1030
01:04:13,180 --> 01:04:17,480
first if you want though. No, I'm gonna, I will say it is on sale and it's

1031
01:04:17,480 --> 01:04:20,020
a hoodie and it's on sale. Yeah, okay, twenty bucks,

1032
01:04:20,020 --> 01:04:25,060
twenty bucks. Even I say eleven ninety nine. Okay, Caleb, you are closer.

1033
01:04:25,060 --> 01:04:26,320
It is twenty two ninety nine.

1034
01:04:27,380 --> 01:04:29,260
so he said, so I'm closer Cameron's close.

1035
01:04:29,260 --> 01:04:34,340
He said you looked at me, looked away from me, looked at cameras at Caleb,

1036
01:04:34,340 --> 01:04:38,860
you are close. I got your names mixed up also. I love the Wendy logo right

1037
01:04:38,860 --> 01:04:41,900
there. That's a beautiful logo. I wish we could zoom in on that. It reminds me

1038
01:04:41,900 --> 01:04:45,780
of it's the Wendy's logo without an S guys. It completely is well. Now this

1039
01:04:45,780 --> 01:04:49,680
is my final item okay, and these are called jelly boy.

1040
01:04:55,820 --> 01:04:56,980
Jelly Boy G.

1041
01:04:56,980 --> 01:04:57,620
Jelly Boy G.

1042
01:04:57,620 --> 01:04:58,320
Jelly Boy G.

1043
01:04:58,320 --> 01:04:59,560
And these are all over print jeans.

1044
01:04:59,560 --> 01:05:00,660
All over print jeans.

1045
01:05:00,660 --> 01:05:01,920
Can you describe them to me?

1046
01:05:01,920 --> 01:05:02,440
Yeah.

1047
01:05:02,440 --> 01:05:06,420
Now they have- can you go ahead for one slide?

1048
01:05:06,420 --> 01:05:11,660
So there is an Oliver on the waistband.

1049
01:05:11,660 --> 01:05:13,540
It says Jelly Boy.

1050
01:05:13,540 --> 01:05:15,420
On the waistband it says Jelly Boy.

1051
01:05:15,420 --> 01:05:21,140
On the front of the pants on the left leg, it is a photo of a very

1052
01:05:22,100 --> 01:05:28,220
handsome young man holding a flute of wine, champagne, and Cameron Fetter and

1053
01:05:28,220 --> 01:05:30,620
on the butt it says jelly on one

1054
01:05:30,620 --> 01:05:34,540
now. I

1055
01:05:34,540 --> 01:05:45,940
also they were found these also yeah they were designed in Italy.

1056
01:05:45,940 --> 01:05:49,440
Shelly

1057
01:05:49,440 --> 01:05:57,940
jeans designs in Italy. Okay, and I want you to guess how I mean Italy should

1058
01:05:57,940 --> 01:06:02,140
tell you that you know the I just saw Bowser walk by, by the way, guys, don't

1059
01:06:02,140 --> 01:06:05,460
tell me that one hundred percent to saw a person walk by with a Bowser show on

1060
01:06:05,460 --> 01:06:06,660
their back. Oh, my God,

1061
01:06:06,660 --> 01:06:12,100
well, just remember Italy Milan, the capital of fashion. These are high

1062
01:06:12,140 --> 01:06:14,300
high fashion pants, so just think about that.

1063
01:06:14,300 --> 01:06:15,740
Also, the

1064
01:06:15,740 --> 01:06:23,420
wait the jelly boy design, the jelly boy design these yes and think also about

1065
01:06:23,420 --> 01:06:26,420
the licensing fee that went into these for the appearance of

1066
01:06:26,420 --> 01:06:30,980
celebrities, celebrities on the jeans, so that will have to be baked into the

1067
01:06:30,980 --> 01:06:34,820
price and the fact to make jeans, make them jeans that look exactly like

1068
01:06:34,820 --> 01:06:36,340
sweatpants. That is very

1069
01:06:36,340 --> 01:06:41,460
yes, look and feel exactly like sweatpants yeah. Okay, so for the jelly

1070
01:06:41,500 --> 01:06:42,840
boy jeans. I'm

1071
01:06:42,840 --> 01:06:44,440
a

1072
01:06:44,440 --> 01:06:49,820
God, this one's tough because whoever posted this really could have put in.

1073
01:06:49,820 --> 01:06:52,500
I will say

1074
01:06:52,500 --> 01:06:57,960
a thousand dollars, a thousand dollars, okay, okay, I'm going to met a game you

1075
01:06:57,960 --> 01:07:02,300
here. I'm looking at this listing. I'm looking at the length of the block

1076
01:07:02,300 --> 01:07:06,360
that's covering the dollar. I don't think a thousand dollars is fitting there.

1077
01:07:06,360 --> 01:07:10,060
I'm going to put in a hundred dollars as my guess.

1078
01:07:10,060 --> 01:07:15,560
because I think that this could be. I think this is three digits of decimal

1079
01:07:15,560 --> 01:07:16,160
point. Well,

1080
01:07:16,160 --> 01:07:17,200
Cameron,

1081
01:07:17,200 --> 01:07:24,640
no way hundred and fifty dollars. I thought that it was going to be. I

1094
01:08:10,980 --> 01:08:15,540
things that this is a picture of a sock that's being held against a subway tile

1095
01:08:15,540 --> 01:08:21,980
like bathroom. Yeah, condition is new, even though it is a dirty sock and this

1096
01:08:21,980 --> 01:08:25,980
is in Queens, New York City. So we can buy this supposed to buy Angel Rodriguez.

1097
01:08:26,500 --> 01:08:31,040
the brand is quick silver size. A point five. How much do you think the dirty

1098
01:08:31,040 --> 01:08:32,360
sock is? Who's first?

1099
01:08:32,360 --> 01:08:36,060
I can go first and I'm gonna say that this is

1100
01:08:36,060 --> 01:08:43,140
I'm gonna say like fifteen dollars is one sock. If it was two socks, it is one

1101
01:08:43,140 --> 01:08:48,100
sock. If it was two socks, I would have said twenty five. Okay, you lock that in

1102
01:08:48,100 --> 01:08:51,940
for me? Yes, I'm gonna lock that in. It's three dollar bill y'all. Okay. Three

1106
01:08:58,080 --> 01:09:01,780
Nine hundred ninety nine thousand nine hundred and ninety nine dollars.

1107
01:09:01,780 --> 01:09:03,580
You didn't tell us it was on sale. That would have chased my whole

1108
01:09:03,580 --> 01:09:03,880
answer.

1109
01:09:03,880 --> 01:09:07,580
Guys, the description, the price has dropped from one mil to nine hundred

1110
01:09:07,580 --> 01:09:10,880
ninety nine thousand nine hundred and ninety nine dollars.

1111
01:09:10,880 --> 01:09:12,080
That's a big deal.

1112
01:09:12,080 --> 01:09:13,580
Okay, this next one is

1113
01:09:13,580 --> 01:09:18,380
the awesome. Go to the next one, please. All right, so I'm just going to

1114
01:09:18,380 --> 01:09:19,980
show this to you a couple slides.

1115
01:09:19,980 --> 01:09:21,180
I know what this is.

1116
01:09:21,180 --> 01:09:22,180
No, you don't.

1117
01:09:23,380 --> 01:09:26,180
there's no way you know what this is. I can tell it's a suit.

1118
01:09:26,180 --> 01:09:31,420
Okay, so wait, I just wanna get guesses about what this is and I

1119
01:09:31,420 --> 01:09:35,540
will slowly reveal what this is, and I'll explain this. This is a

1120
01:09:35,540 --> 01:09:40,660
some kind of image of... It looks almost computerized image of Dwayne

1121
01:09:40,660 --> 01:09:45,460
Wade wearing a Miami Heat jersey, okay? And it doesn't really look like

1122
01:09:45,460 --> 01:09:47,520
him, his neck is a little too skinny. Yeah, it doesn't look like Dwayne

1123
01:09:47,520 --> 01:09:50,540
Wade at all. It does a little... Or no, sorry, Ray Allen. Oh,

1124
01:09:50,540 --> 01:09:58,700
Okay, yeah. So this is like a Ray Allen Miami Heat era corner three crazy shot

1125
01:09:58,700 --> 01:10:02,800
to win the championship era. Ray Allen. He's got a basketball. He's sitting

1126
01:10:02,800 --> 01:10:06,000
there. Yeah, he looks a little, a little computer. Now, I have to say,

1127
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:09,140
I think, I think, I think Patrick kind of poison the well a little bit and

1128
01:10:09,140 --> 01:10:12,640
I'm looking at this and I really am just seeing latex, latex covering latex

1129
01:10:12,640 --> 01:10:14,900
covering latex. Alright, can you go to the next slide?

1130
01:10:16,160 --> 01:10:20,700
so now this is an action. Okay, no, this is this is an action. Okay, this is a

1131
01:10:20,700 --> 01:10:25,960
real doll. Could be also this could be a real doll or this could be a three D

1132
01:10:25,960 --> 01:10:26,440
model.

1133
01:10:26,440 --> 01:10:30,040
That's a good point. I could see that because I saw a couple of those people

1134
01:10:30,040 --> 01:10:32,800
selling those all right. I would like you to go to the next slide.

1135
01:10:32,800 --> 01:10:41,240
Okay, guys, he's naked and he's showing his butt. It's the same guy that he's

1136
01:10:41,240 --> 01:10:44,920
looking back still holding the basketball naked and showing his butt

1137
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:48,800
cheeks. Okay, so now next slide. It was on YouTube. So this is, of course,

1138
01:10:48,800 --> 01:10:54,520
Iron Tech Sex Dolls, gay male realistic TPE full body life size love toy for

1139
01:10:54,520 --> 01:10:58,720
women. I don't think that a woman is buying this. Well, it says gay male.

1140
01:10:58,720 --> 01:11:03,560
Well, there is it in both. Yeah, 13 people are watching this item. This is

1141
01:11:03,560 --> 01:11:08,840
in high demand. Okay, well, you kind of also screwed up here by showing six

1142
01:11:08,840 --> 01:11:12,520
months for 99. No, it says that on every eBay. Oh, okay, never mind. It's on

1143
01:11:12,520 --> 01:11:15,120
ninety nine, so we know it's more than ninety nine dollars, but we could

1144
01:11:15,120 --> 01:11:17,120
assume that yeah, I think I think it's all right.

1145
01:11:17,120 --> 01:11:22,480
I'm gonna hit this with I'm just and I kind of just trying to let these fly

1146
01:11:22,480 --> 01:11:26,880
from the hip nine thousand dollars. I think nine thousand USD okay, I'm gonna

1147
01:11:26,880 --> 01:11:31,560
go lower. I'm gonna say twelve hundred USD really

1148
01:11:31,560 --> 01:11:36,240
Patrick. You are pretty damn close. This is it's almost like you've looked at

1149
01:11:36,240 --> 01:11:37,160
this before. This is

1150
01:11:37,160 --> 01:11:41,920
this is thirteen hundred and ninety nine. You are two hundred bucks off man.

1151
01:11:41,920 --> 01:11:45,680
that is you see very familiar with this world

1152
01:11:45,680 --> 01:11:50,840
that is impressive. Okay, I need to see this thing and I need to see it in

1153
01:11:50,840 --> 01:11:52,240
action. This is clearly a

1154
01:11:52,240 --> 01:11:56,680
rendering of it. Yeah, I don't think it's got to be a real photos like that

1155
01:11:56,680 --> 01:12:00,520
can't be real. Okay, I'm willing to bet this is made to order and nobody has

1156
01:12:00,520 --> 01:12:01,400
bought one yet. Yeah,

1157
01:12:01,400 --> 01:12:02,800

1160

01:12:17,920 --> 01:12:21,840

01:12:31,240 --> 01:12:34,920

Okay, I'm going to go $13,000.

1168
01:12:46,240 --> 01:12:47,240
$13,000.

1169

$12,000.

1170
01:12:48,240 --> 01:12:49,240

1173
01:12:51,240 --> 01:12:52,240
And you said what?

1174
01:12:52,240 --> 01:12:53,240
$700.

1175
01:12:53,240 --> 01:12:54,240
Cameron?

1176
01:12:54,240 --> 01:12:58,760
You won, but you are far off. This is $11,000.

1177
01:12:58,760 --> 01:13:04,400
Oh my God, that's almost the exact same price as the Johnny Depp one.

interesting doll so say what this is elmo it's it's a tickle me elmo doll

1185
01:13:33,800 --> 01:13:38,640
Okay, so next slide. This is actually a authentic haunted doll, extremely

1186
01:13:38,640 --> 01:13:43,080
active, real Elmo demon Astaroth attachment. Oh, the demon Astaroth is

1187
01:13:43,080 --> 01:13:46,700
attached. Astaroth has been attached. Astaroth is a powerful demon. There's a

1188
01:13:46,700 --> 01:13:51,100
video on this where the guy talks to the Elmo doll. I forgot to add it, but

1189
01:13:51,100 --> 01:13:55,080
on the listing, he has a YouTube short where he talks to the Elmo doll, makes

1190
01:13:55,080 --> 01:14:00,380
the Elmo turn on a light bulb. Whoa! Tell me that isn't freaking your brain.

1191
01:14:00,400 --> 01:14:04,320
it's extremely power. That is scary. So guess is on this haunted Elmo.

1192
01:14:04,320 --> 01:14:09,420
Check this out six hundred and sixty six dollars and sixty six cents. That's a

1193
01:14:09,420 --> 01:14:12,520
strong. Yeah, that is a strong guess. Well, I'm gonna go nine hundred and

1194
01:14:12,520 --> 01:14:14,520
ninety nine dollars and ninety nine cents.

1195
01:14:14,520 --> 01:14:15,800
Patrick

1196
01:14:15,800 --> 01:14:18,420
Cameron

1197
01:14:18,420 --> 01:14:21,520
this is a deal for ninety nine.

1198
01:14:21,520 --> 01:14:25,640
That's kind of a good deal. Yeah, I mean, Asterod is one of the major

1199
01:14:25,640 --> 01:14:28,240
demons. You get the whole demon, you get the whole thing. It's trapped. It's

1200
01:14:28,240 --> 01:14:31,200
attached. I mean that's a demon that I feel like that's like that's a

1201
01:14:31,200 --> 01:14:33,980
celebrity. Most of the demons that get attached to stuff. I feel like

1202
01:14:33,980 --> 01:14:36,300
typically you want they don't have a name you or you wouldn't know their

1203
01:14:36,300 --> 01:14:39,480
names. It's like you know it's like oh, I hung out with Jeff at a party

1204
01:14:39,480 --> 01:14:43,800
exactly as a real, but I hung out with miles teller at a party the other

1205
01:14:43,800 --> 01:14:44,120
night.

1206
01:14:44,120 --> 01:14:51,360
How much of the party cost and I have one last one guys. This is again. I

1207
01:14:51,360 --> 01:14:54,600
kind of want you to guess what this is. This is a text from Jesus Christ that

1208
01:14:54,640 --> 01:14:59,340
is I'm coming soon. Are you ready on an iPhone and it's noon o'clock and the

1209
01:14:59,340 --> 01:15:02,860
phone is charged and it's being held by a woman? Yeah, there's an iPhone three or

1210
01:15:02,860 --> 01:15:06,560
four, by the way, but it's not actually a phone. It is an image. It's an image of

1211
01:15:06,560 --> 01:15:10,380
well, yeah, it's on the TV, by the way, and this is a this is a book.

1212
01:15:10,380 --> 01:15:12,500
I think that this could be

1213
01:15:12,500 --> 01:15:18,460
text from Jesus Christ, like you're like paying to first Jesus Christ to text

1214
01:15:18,460 --> 01:15:21,780
somebody. You think it's a service? Yeah, I think it could be a service, like kind

1215
01:15:21,800 --> 01:15:26,340
like a face time with Santa service slide guys. This is Christian NFT digital

1216
01:15:26,340 --> 01:15:26,980
art. Oh

1217
01:15:26,980 --> 01:15:31,900
what the fuck oh the employee anti Christ, oh my God,

1218
01:15:31,900 --> 01:15:34,540
oh my God,

1219
01:15:34,540 --> 01:15:39,700
as soon as I say I'm coming soon. Are you ready? A picture of me fell off the

1220
01:15:39,700 --> 01:15:40,180
wall

1221
01:15:40,180 --> 01:15:48,700
right after we're talking about Astor on. Oh my God, my God, that is scary.

1222
01:15:48,740 --> 01:15:54,040
last. I wish we had that on tape. I wish we had that was that in the corner.

1223
01:15:54,040 --> 01:16:00,120
It is not here anymore man. That is I do not like that's crazy. It was me

1224
01:16:00,120 --> 01:16:05,440
something bad is going to my to me. I do know this blood results or these are

1225
01:16:05,440 --> 01:16:09,740
going to be bad. Oh, my God, you're going to have different blood. I don't

1226
01:16:09,740 --> 01:16:12,740
want to say Jesus anymore. Yeah, why please Jesus? No, you want to say his

1227
01:16:12,740 --> 01:16:15,220
name to cast out the demon. Yeah, Jesus save

1228
01:16:16,140 --> 01:16:19,780
Okay, so save how much you think this Christian digital NFT art is

1229
01:16:19,780 --> 01:16:22,980
1 million dollars, 2 million.

1230
01:16:22,980 --> 01:16:25,940
That's a little over guys.

1231
01:16:25,940 --> 01:16:31,420
A little bit over. I didn't lock in. I'm gonna say 1,000. No, you already said,

1232
01:16:31,420 --> 01:16:33,820
you already said a million, you already said 2 million. Okay. You're both.

01:20:07,260 --> 01:20:14,780
lime lime? You're not even saving a syllable there. What about salt? Sal. Pepper is pep?

1306
01:21:29,820 --> 01:21:38,340
whole no no no no again it is a confusion situation but even enough time

1307
01:21:38,340 --> 01:21:44,740
has passed not to forgive and forget but to stop calling the crowd time has passed

1308
01:21:44,740 --> 01:21:49,460
is a crazy thing this not even a hundred years man all right well once we hit the

1309
01:21:49,460 --> 01:21:51,900
