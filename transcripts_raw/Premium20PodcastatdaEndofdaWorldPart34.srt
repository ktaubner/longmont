I'm reading the news.

25
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:39,200
Put your phone back under the couch.

26
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:40,200
I'm reading the news.

27
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:41,200
Put your phone back under the couch.

28
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:44,080
US considering cash stimulus as global cases pass.

29
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:46,720
You ain't got cash, you can't get cash on the internet.

30
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:49,280
Cameron, we might be getting a cash stimulus, I'm telling you.

31
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:52,360
I'm gonna cash stimuli your fucking asshole if you don't put that phone away.

32
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:53,360

00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:56,360
Easy.

36
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:58,640
I'm gonna put sharpened coins up into you.

37
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:01,640
Yeah, this is the one where we give all of our thoughts on this thing.

38
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:02,640
"Exit the Gungeon" is Trenjin.

39
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:03,640
Trenjin?

40
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:04,640
"Exit the Gungeon"?

41
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:05,640
Yeah, what?

42
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:06,640
Is that a new one?

43
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:08,640
That's, yeah, they just announced the sequel.

44
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:09,640
Oh.

45
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:10,640
Oh, so you guys want me to put my phone away?

46
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:11,640
Shut up!

47
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:12,640
Yeah, put your phone away.

48
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:13,640
You want me to put my phone away right now?

49
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:15,640
I did not know that you were going to talk about games.

50
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:16,640
Yeah.

51
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:18,640
If you're talking about games, you can do whatever you want.

52
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:19,640
Don't tell him that.

53
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:21,640
I was going to talk about games the whole time.

54
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:24,640
If you turn on G4, we will just watch TV right now.

55
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:25,640
Mm-hmm.

56
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:26,640
We could do a watch-along too.

57
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:30,480
I honestly feel like 15 years ago we could have had a show on G4 pretty easy.

58
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:32,480
Don't turn the TV on.

59
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:36,320
We could do a watch along to Combat Tai Chi.

60
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:37,920
Combat Tai Chi with Richard Clear.

61
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:41,360
I thought Tai Chi was like a thing fat people do in white clothes.

62
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:42,360
Don't open the DVD.

63
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:43,360
Look what you did.

64
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:45,040
You told him you could watch stuff.

65
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:46,040
No, he can't watch it.

66
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:47,040
He can show us.

67
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:49,240
Look at this fucked up DVD.

68
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:50,240
Whoa.

69
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:52,640
Somebody's riding the hog outside.

70
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:54,200
That's the Mad Max starting.

71
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:58,580
might be the guy on the hog who listens to Steve Miller band all the time that's

72
00:01:58,580 --> 00:02:03,660

switch cartridge tastes all right that's not a bad dude it smells like I feel like

87
00:03:18,140 --> 00:03:23,420
I mean okay to be fair this is my first time ever smelling a DVD.

88
00:03:23,420 --> 00:03:28,460
They could open another DVD.

89
00:03:28,460 --> 00:03:31,460
Let me open up Krav Maga the Israeli connection.

90
00:03:31,460 --> 00:03:34,860
Open Krav Maga it doesn't smell bad it smells like rubber.

91
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:35,860
It doesn't smell like a tire.

92
00:03:35,860 --> 00:03:38,260
Oh yeah it just smells like industrial.

93
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:42,540
It just smells like a weird plastic thing.

94
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:46,580
But this is not unreasonable for like a shitty DVD to smell like that.

95
00:03:46,580 --> 00:03:47,580
Do you know?

96
00:03:47,580 --> 00:03:51,120
I've never smelled a deal. So yet I feel like the is really crumb. I got

97
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:54,320
connection is not a fair control group. I think this is also going to smell

98
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:57,140
crazy. This one smells normal. What do you mean normal?

99
00:03:57,140 --> 00:04:01,780
It's like strawberry was like a normal DVD. No, this smells exactly the

100
00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:05,060
same. What are you talking about? Smell exactly the same. It's not as

101
00:04:05,060 --> 00:04:08,940
strong. It's the same smell. Yeah, it's not open. It is the same. Open a

102
00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:12,740
different DVD, a non combat art. This is this is exactly how the virus

103
00:04:12,740 --> 00:04:13,220
started.

104
00:04:15,140 --> 00:04:20,660
sniffing DVDs and caught something. No smell, no smell at all. What DVD is this?

105
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:24,020
What DVD is this? This is Brass Eye. This is Brass Eye. This is from the UK. Yeah,

106
00:04:24,020 --> 00:04:26,660
they have different smells over there. It's a completely different smell. I

107
00:04:26,660 --> 00:04:28,740
wouldn't say there's no smell. It's definitely a different smell. Let me see

108
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:29,140
it.

109
00:04:29,140 --> 00:04:31,780
That's all I'm saying.

110
00:04:31,780 --> 00:04:37,340
This one's, yeah, it smells different, I guess. It smells like... I don't know, can

111
00:04:37,340 --> 00:04:40,340
you get a normal DVD? It smells normal. My head is hurting.

112
00:04:41,980 --> 00:04:43,980
I think I'm I think I'm high.

113
00:04:43,980 --> 00:04:46,980
This one's checking out with Dr. Sleepy.

114
00:04:46,980 --> 00:04:48,980
You're going to smell all of Patrick's DVDs.

115
00:04:48,980 --> 00:04:49,980
No smell.

116
00:04:49,980 --> 00:04:51,980
No smell at all.

117
00:04:51,980 --> 00:04:53,980
Let me smell this.

118
00:04:53,980 --> 00:04:56,980
Yeah, this one has the least smell so far, I think.

119
00:04:56,980 --> 00:04:58,980
Okay, I think I've discovered what it is.

120
00:04:58,980 --> 00:05:00,980
It has to do...

121
00:05:00,980 --> 00:05:02,980
I can like taste that in my mouth.

122
00:05:02,980 --> 00:05:03,980
Maybe it's the sooner you open it.

123
00:05:03,980 --> 00:05:04,980
It's the new DVD smell.

124
00:05:04,980 --> 00:05:06,980
I think that is a new DVD smell.

125
00:05:06,980 --> 00:05:10,980
Which is older, Brass Eye or Steve Rule?

126
00:05:10,980 --> 00:05:17,380
Steve Ruhle. I knew it and Steve Ruhle smells the least. Yeah. It's yeah it's new DVD

127
00:05:17,380 --> 00:05:20,740
it's new DVD smell. You know what that could be that could be but no because this one was

128
00:05:20,740 --> 00:05:25,420
unsealed and we opened it and it smelled less bad as this one which was open. You keep saying

129
00:05:25,420 --> 00:05:31,900
unsealed when you mean sealed. Ah fuck off. This one didn't smell as bad. Exactly and

130
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:36,660
we just opened that one and it smelled. It's no I mean this one smelled worse this one

131
00:05:36,660 --> 00:05:41,540
didn't smell. Wait, okay, give me these two. Okay. And when did you open Combat Tai Chi?

132
00:05:41,540 --> 00:05:45,980
Never opened it. That one came, like, that came unsealed. Yeah, but I bet nobody had ever

133
00:05:45,980 --> 00:05:51,540
opened the box before. No, my grandpa John did. Well, he did that to that. He did something

134
00:05:51,540 --> 00:05:57,420
to that DVD. That's what I'm saying! He did something to the DVD! I think they smell pretty

135
00:05:57,420 --> 00:06:03,700
equally bad. I think Combat Tai Chi is a bit stronger. No, smell them both again back to

136
00:06:03,700 --> 00:06:06,980
Okay, hold on. Will you hold this like a boom mic so you can get my reaction?

137
00:06:06,980 --> 00:06:12,020
Yeah. Okay, I'm opening. Oh, we should do a blind test. Okay.

138
00:06:12,020 --> 00:06:16,260
Okay, wait, wait, wait. Hold the mic and close your eyes. No, don't pause it. Just close your eyes.

139
00:06:16,260 --> 00:06:19,060
I'm going to shuffle. Well, now he knows which ones which. No, no, no. He's closing his eyes.

140
00:06:19,060 --> 00:06:24,100
My eyes are closed. Okay, let's see if I can tell which one is Combat Tai Chi. All right.

141
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:30,500
Okay, I'm going to make it. Now, keep your eyes closed. Don't say it. Don't say it.

142
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:36,980
Cameron is giving him a DVD right now. The first DVD. Smell.

143
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:41,820
Okay, you smelled it? Alright, are you ready for the other DVD? Yeah. Alright, we're

144
00:06:41,820 --> 00:06:50,100
giving him the other DVD. Smell. Okay, now which do you think is Combat Tai Chi? The

145
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:54,900
first one. You're right. Yeah, see? It has a fucking distinct smell and it has a

146
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:58,580
weird... Alright, alright, let's try. Let's do this with... Now you have to do it,

147
00:06:58,580 --> 00:07:02,060
Cameron because I know that Patrick will pass. All right yeah I don't know I think

148
00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:05,540
I have a pretty weak sense of smell in general but I'll try it. All right close

149
00:07:05,540 --> 00:07:11,460
your eyes. My eyes are closed. All right I'm gonna give you one DVD now. Okay all right

150
00:07:11,460 --> 00:07:25,260
okay he's giving him the DVD. Smell. Okay. Okay now the second DVD. Okay now? Yeah.

151
00:07:26,460 --> 00:07:31,500
can I open my eyes I think the second one is combat Tai Chi you are right see it

152
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:35,060
has a fucking distinct smell I'm not wrong about but it's the same so I could

153
00:07:35,060 --> 00:07:38,140
tell it was combat Tai Chi because it was a stronger smell but it's it is the same

154
00:07:38,140 --> 00:07:42,780
same smell but it's just different it's a matter of magnitude yeah okay so I

155
00:07:42,780 --> 00:07:47,620
admit it might not be new DVD smoke is cuz I touchy is older but smells

156
00:07:47,620 --> 00:07:52,140
stronger yeah it's kind of the uglier the guy on the on the thing is the stinkier

157
00:07:52,140 --> 00:07:58,860
the DVD is. Post pictures of these DVDs. It's funny that what I love about this one is like

158
00:07:58,860 --> 00:08:02,860
if you just showed me the picture and there was no text this is exactly what...

159
00:08:02,860 --> 00:08:04,860
It looks like a video, it looks like a PS4 character.

160
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:09,580
If you showed me just the picture of this guy and said name this DVD I would have called

161
00:08:09,580 --> 00:08:13,740
it Krav Maga the Israeli Connection just based on his general...

162
00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:16,860
Which is exactly what it's called. His general face and look and the fact that

163
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:18,380
there's spikes behind him. Yeah.

164
00:08:18,380 --> 00:08:19,580
Spikes behind him. Yeah.

165
00:08:21,180 --> 00:08:27,020
All I'm saying is that that DVD has a very harsh plastic smell and it's strange.

166
00:08:27,020 --> 00:08:28,020
Yeah.

167
00:08:28,020 --> 00:08:29,020
Yes.

168
00:08:29,020 --> 00:08:34,940
Yeah, but I also don't think, it also isn't necessarily like a bad smell to me.

169
00:08:34,940 --> 00:08:35,940
I hate that smell.

170
00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:36,940
I don't like it.

171
00:08:36,940 --> 00:08:37,940
I feel sick.

172
00:08:37,940 --> 00:08:40,980
I think if you breathe that in for more than one sniff.

173
00:08:40,980 --> 00:08:43,500
If that smell was in your room, you would not stay in your room.

174
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:46,780
They're from the same company?

175
00:08:46,780 --> 00:08:49,980
Imagine the smell of the DVD of the company.

176
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:52,220
Yeah, imagine what the CEO would smell like.

177
00:08:52,220 --> 00:08:53,220
Yeah.

178
00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:54,220
Oh my God.

179
00:08:54,220 --> 00:08:55,220
He, yeah, he, he kisses every single DVD.

180
00:08:55,220 --> 00:08:56,220
Imagine the smell of the factory where they're making the plastic.

181
00:08:56,220 --> 00:09:00,220
The factory where they're making the plastic, man.

182
00:09:00,220 --> 00:09:02,740
It's gotta be fucked up, dude.

183
00:09:02,740 --> 00:09:05,020
Yeah, that's all I'm saying.

184
00:09:05,020 --> 00:09:06,460
Let's try a video game.

185
00:09:06,460 --> 00:09:11,420
Yeah, wait, get out a, get a, now a Switch game we already know that's gonna smell fucked

186
00:09:11,420 --> 00:09:13,380
up, so get the non-Switch game.

187
00:09:13,380 --> 00:09:14,980
Do Switch games smell fucked up?

188
00:09:14,980 --> 00:09:17,420
They taste fucked up, so I'd assume they'd smell fucked up.

189
00:09:17,420 --> 00:09:22,060
see there's no there's a copy of skate to with the avatar in it okay so this is not

190
00:09:22,060 --> 00:09:27,460
that's corrupted yeah this is a sample that's a DVD inside a video game case we

191
00:09:27,460 --> 00:09:30,740
gotta be scientific about yeah that's gonna no matter what smell like shit I

192
00:09:30,740 --> 00:09:38,940
don't know what just pick up yeah that should use an unsealed copy of Paul

193
00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:43,460
Blart mall cop okay so yeah we can see if this smell one yeah so okay old is

194
00:09:43,460 --> 00:09:47,240
because this is see is it the new dvd smell is a new dvd smell is what we'll

195
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:51,620
figure out or is it just the martial art dvd smell every martial. We should

196
00:09:51,620 --> 00:09:55,460
every episode that we record today is just going to get more and more on like

197
00:09:55,460 --> 00:09:55,980
this

198
00:09:55,980 --> 00:09:59,780
just doing things yeah.

199
00:09:59,780 --> 00:10:03,380
Oh my God,

200
00:10:03,380 --> 00:10:05,680
no, this is a new smell.

201
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:14,800
his eyes open so wide. You look like a meerkat who saw a lion.

202
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:19,600
Yeah, you look like you just like you. Okay, now we got to test this. You look

203
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:22,960
like you acquired dark knowledge. You look like an H.P. Lovecraft. That's a

204
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:23,840
different smell.

205
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:26,960
I can't smell it.

206
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:30,000
I don't know if I smell anything on this one.

207
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,120
All right, I'm going in. Yeah, do it.

208
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:37,960
That one smells darker.

209
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:38,960
It smells darker.

210
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:39,960
Darker.

211
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:40,960
This is like a...

212
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:41,960
What year did this movie come out?

213
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:42,960
I don't know.

214
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:43,960
2008.

215
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:44,960
No, yeah, 2008 because my uncle saw them filming it at the Burlington Mall and my grandpa was

216
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:45,960
dying in the hospital.

217
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:46,960
This smells like 2008.

218
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:47,960
Let me try it again.

219
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:48,960
It has such a...

220
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:49,960
It smells like a new Golden Corral.

221
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:50,960
Oh, okay.

222
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:51,960
I can't smell this one.

223
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:52,960
You don't smell that?

224
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:53,960
I don't smell anything on this one.

225
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:54,960
Okay, here I have some...

226
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:55,960
This is the Yanny versus Laurel of smells.

227
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:56,960
There is a...

228
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:57,960
There is a...

229
00:10:57,960 --> 00:10:58,960
I can't smell it.

230
00:10:58,960 --> 00:10:59,960
I can't smell it.

231
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:00,960
I can't smell it.

232
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:01,960
I can't smell it.

233
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:02,960
I can't smell it.

234
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:09,280
thing on this one. This is the Yanny vs. Laurel of smells. I will say, there's a twist to this

235
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:19,960
one. You turn it around, eco-friendly packaging. Oh my god. Plastic case uses 20% less material,

236
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:29,720
30% post-consumer waste paper. So that doesn't count. This is an outlier. It smells like

237
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:33,520
a new vegetable like a vegetable dr. Seuss would invent yeah that's what it's like

238
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:38,120
a needle yeah yeah it smells like a clumble yeah a clumble earth needle yeah

239
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:45,080
you get another DVD get another DVD this is always what I wanted the patreon

240
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:51,600
episodes to be like yeah yeah there's a Cosmopolis what that that's a Greek

241
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:56,640
guy's last name that's the last name of the character he plays in yeah that's my

242
00:11:56,640 --> 00:12:01,980
down my downstairs neighbor who's a pro soccer player his name George Cosmopolis

243
00:12:01,980 --> 00:12:07,080
Georgie but his real name is Eleftherios but he goes by George okay I can't tell

244
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:10,800
that one all right I smell then was this one new or not no that's not new I've

245
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:17,000
watched it already a very slight I think it has a very slight weird plastic smell

246
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:20,840
I think you can smell that we can I think I just I don't have a good sense of

247
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:26,920
smell I will say that. The Tai Chi one left an aftertaste. Oh that has a smell.

248
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:33,360
Yeah it's kind of similar smell to the Tai Chi one. I would say this is like a sour.

249
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:38,200
This is like the DVD is old. This is David Cronenberg put his slime into this

250
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:42,360
one that's why it smells like that. This is actually the least...

251
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:47,080
This does smell a little sour. It smells a little sour. You just did Griffin McElroy

252
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:52,040
voice dude. It's a pretty good movie. I haven't seen it yet. Along with the smell it's a pretty

253
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:56,600
good movie. Yeah this one's yeah this one definitely has a smell. Paul Giamatti's in it.

254
00:12:56,600 --> 00:13:01,960
Let's smell the plastic wrapping from the DVD. Yeah that's true we got to do that too. Smells.

255
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:09,480
Just I want somebody yeah I want the Toronto star called Cosmopolis a blockbuster of the mind.

256
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:14,760
More like a blockbuster of the nose. It has some stank on it. Should start a movie review show

257
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:21,880
show you just smell them okay. I got it that is such a good idea. I have a real

258
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:25,840
curve ball about the third a blue ray of the shape of water. This is going to

259
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:29,600
smell like fish. They put a real fish smell into it.

260
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:33,200
I just smelled like my hand.

261
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:37,640
What does your hand smell like? I don't know. I think they got rid of smells

262
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:40,200
during that when they made blue. That was one of the advances. This one has a

263
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:44,160
DVD and a blue ray. This is a DVD plus blue ray copy. I think that's what you're

264
00:13:44,180 --> 00:13:49,300
nothing that's like wine and cheese. This one smells sterile. This one actively

265
00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:53,500
smells like nothing. This smells like they tried to remove a smell. Right.

266
00:13:53,500 --> 00:14:00,380
Here's my idea. Yeah. The reason why DVD Blu-ray copies exist like a combo disc

267
00:14:00,380 --> 00:14:05,100
or a combo package is because there is a DVD smell and there's a Blu-ray smell

268
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:11,580
and they can't. Okay. All right. This is the smell that Caleb has to close his

269
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:18,320
for. All right close your eyes. I'll pass it over. Okay all right take it open it up.

270
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:21,600
Do I have to guess what movie this is?

271
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:26,320
Oh wait this is a really good activity. Okay all right wait wait wait let me pass it to Caleb

272
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:30,080
before you smell it. I have to guess what movie this is. And you have to open your eyes mid-smell.

273
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:36,720
Don't open your eyes no just smell. Smell and then guess. Guess what it is. Just based on that?

274
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:42,480
yeah sleepless in Seattle final answer my mic take a look

275
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:51,240

276
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:54,800
but no you know now that you said it I'm looking at the case of a mustache I'm

277
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:59,640
looking at the case now and you said that comment about his arms yeah he's

278
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:03,000

304
00:17:12,700 --> 00:17:17,940
I'm interested to see if this is the same smell as a DVD. Okay, we're testing to see

305
00:17:17,940 --> 00:17:21,940
of Kurt Vonnegut's Cat's Cradle book smells like a DVD.

306
00:17:21,940 --> 00:17:24,940
But you know what I'm saying? Like a book smell? Like an old book smell?

307
00:17:24,940 --> 00:17:25,940
Yeah, of course. Yeah.

308
00:17:25,940 --> 00:17:27,540
It smells like yellow paper.

309
00:17:27,540 --> 00:17:36,380
I don't know if it's because my nasal pathways have been corrupted by the Israeli connection,

310
00:17:36,380 --> 00:17:39,220
but this doesn't smell like anything to me.

311
00:17:39,220 --> 00:17:42,900
Let me smell it. Let me smell it.

312
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:45,340
This looks like the lead singer of the Mighty Mighty Boss Tones.

313
00:17:45,340 --> 00:17:47,900
No, this smells like a book. This has book smell.

314
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:51,560
The guy on the cover of the Israeli Connection looks like the lead singer of Mighty Mighty

315
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:54,300
Boss Tones. He looks like he's about to sing a ska song.

316
00:17:54,300 --> 00:17:56,820
He looks like a Bond villain.

317
00:17:56,820 --> 00:17:59,060
A little bit. A little bit.

318
00:17:59,060 --> 00:18:00,340
I think he looks more like...

319
00:18:00,340 --> 00:18:02,900
In like a Bollywood version of James Bond.

320
00:18:02,900 --> 00:18:08,320
He looks... Can you put that back up there? He looks more like... He looks like the guy

321
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:11,620
from Mighty... He looks like he's about to sing Never Had to Knock on Wood.

322
00:18:11,620 --> 00:18:12,620
Yeah.

It's like punk rock for cops and like just the most racist man in the world named Bob Shaughnessy.

The Pokes.

337
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:53,540
No, I'm thinking...

338
00:18:53,540 --> 00:18:54,820
Flogging Molly.

339
00:18:54,820 --> 00:18:56,260
That's what I'm thinking of, yeah.

340
00:18:56,260 --> 00:18:59,060
They're like, do the same thing but they're not like Blue Eyes Matter.

341
00:18:59,060 --> 00:19:03,300
But the Dropkick Murphys are like, they had that song for the Red Sox.

342
00:19:03,300 --> 00:19:03,620
Yeah.

343
00:19:03,620 --> 00:19:04,340
They had Tessie.

344
00:19:04,340 --> 00:19:06,100
Sweet Caroline.

345
00:19:06,100 --> 00:19:06,420
No.

346
00:19:06,420 --> 00:19:07,700
Yeah, they made Sweet Caroline.

347
00:19:07,700 --> 00:19:10,100
Tessie and then they named the girl mascot.

348
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:23,860
goes oh yeah they made that yeah the game so they made it from Boston

349
00:19:23,860 --> 00:19:27,740
don't don't if they aren't that's fucked I have to be from Boston we really

350
00:19:27,740 --> 00:19:32,260
funny they aren't I would like I would like them way more whenever I find out

351
00:19:32,260 --> 00:19:35,980
like a band is like posers and they're making up their background I like them

352
00:19:35,980 --> 00:19:39,780
so I like them so much more yeah honestly like a house of pain they're

353
00:19:39,780 --> 00:19:46,140
from Los Angeles and like Celtic Jersey. I think I remember okay this my dad was

354
00:19:46,140 --> 00:19:50,540
really into the front bottoms for a little while and he told me he was

355
00:19:50,540 --> 00:19:54,980
listening to like yeah dude it's great dad is yeah he um no wonder he was

356
00:19:54,980 --> 00:19:58,780
listening to one of their album commentaries like where they talk about

357
00:19:58,780 --> 00:20:02,100
the meanings of the songs and they have a song that's about like the guy's

358
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:05,860
girlfriend getting an abortion and it's like everyone's like this is so deep and

359
00:20:05,860 --> 00:20:08,940
great and on like the comment they like talk about like what how why they wrote

360
00:20:08,940 --> 00:20:11,520
the songs and stuff and the guy's just like, "Yeah, I don't know. I don't know

361
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:16,740
anyone who's gotten an abortion. I just thought it was rock and roll." And I was like, "Oh, I

362
00:20:16,740 --> 00:20:19,980
like you guys now. That's awesome." They're like, "Yeah, none of

363
00:20:19,980 --> 00:20:23,220
these stories are true. We just thought it sounded cool." The only example I can

364
00:20:23,220 --> 00:20:27,860
think of that is Blink-182, how they like wrote all of their songs about being 15

365
00:20:27,860 --> 00:20:32,820
when they were like 32. Yeah, so great. So sick. So funny to do that. I love it.

366
00:20:32,820 --> 00:20:35,940
And all those songs are like, "I fucked a 17 year old.

367
00:20:35,940 --> 00:20:38,520
"Josie, you are 14 and I'm 20."

368
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:42,960
(laughing)

369
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:44,000
- Dude, they rock.

370
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:44,840
- Yeah.

371
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:46,380
- Dude, Blink-182 is a great band.

372
00:20:46,380 --> 00:20:49,680
- Dude, I unashamedly love Blink-182.

373
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:51,020
- Yeah, I've been getting back into it.

374
00:20:51,020 --> 00:20:52,460
There's just been so much shit that I just like--

375
00:20:52,460 --> 00:20:53,740
- Are you listening to the new stuff?

376
00:20:53,740 --> 00:20:55,760
- No, I would never listen to Blink-182,

377
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:57,780
the album that they put out when I was in the eighth grade.

378
00:20:57,780 --> 00:20:58,620
- It's not bad.

379
00:20:58,620 --> 00:20:59,760
- That fucking, what was that album?

380
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:01,340
The fucking worst album cover?

381
00:21:01,340 --> 00:21:02,180
It just looks like a--

382
00:21:02,180 --> 00:21:09,700
bunch of like Nicki Nora's Infinite Playlist. Yeah, them and I feel like Weezer is another

383
00:21:09,700 --> 00:21:15,060
band. I've been listening to a bunch of Sum 41. Sum 41 rocks dude. So good. My favorite

384
00:21:15,060 --> 00:21:20,260
thing to do is just get drunk and then just listen to just early 90s or late 90s pop punk.

385
00:21:20,260 --> 00:21:26,220
I get drunk and I get sad and then I watch the music videos in a row for Sum 41 Fat Lip.

386
00:21:26,220 --> 00:21:30,020
Greatest music video of all time. Every time I die map change. I don't get sad I just get

387
00:21:30,020 --> 00:21:33,380
too excited and I'm like why don't people why isn't anyone else excited?

388
00:21:33,380 --> 00:21:37,540
Patrick's jumping up and down watching Fatlib. I've done that we did that at

389
00:21:37,540 --> 00:21:42,580
Noah's that one time. Dude I think with you two I've seen that that music

390
00:21:42,580 --> 00:21:45,940
video like 15 times. I love that music video so much it's so good.

391
00:21:45,940 --> 00:21:50,300
Definitely the best ever. There's a third sad music video that I watch or like a wistful

392
00:21:50,300 --> 00:21:54,900
you know yeah I like drunk alone like. Pretending you're like 16. Yeah exactly

393
00:21:54,900 --> 00:22:00,300
Sugar Ray every morning. Sugar were going down swinging by Fall Out Boy.

394
00:22:00,300 --> 00:22:05,260
That one? Swing swing by All American Rejects. Growing up I thought that Fall Out Boy, All

395
00:22:05,260 --> 00:22:10,220
American Rejects, I thought they were gay. Yeah I did too. And OK Go, like all that

396
00:22:10,220 --> 00:22:13,020
stuff. That was my favorite. When I was like 8?

397
00:22:13,020 --> 00:22:17,020
Oh my god. No, No, No, All American Rejects was my favorite band. I loved All

398
00:22:17,020 --> 00:22:20,500
American Rejects. Yeah. See I liked like I was in. Because they had that bionicle

399
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:26,480
commercial. I was in a Blink-182, Sum 41, Newfound Glory, Set Your Goals, 4-Year Strong.

400
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:30,780
But you listened to like vegan hardcore shit. Yeah, I was also listening to like Earth Crisis.

401
00:22:30,780 --> 00:22:33,860
I was listening to like, I had a scoff phase when I was 12. Earth Crisis was my favorite

402
00:22:33,860 --> 00:22:38,720
band as a kid. I had like a really bad scoff phase. That sucks man. Dude, I loved Sublime

403
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:45,260
when I was 12 for like 3 months. I was super into Five Finger Death Punch. Damn. Like super

404
00:22:45,260 --> 00:22:48,620
into them. They were like my favorite band for a really long time. I liked Slipknot a

405
00:22:48,620 --> 00:22:52,940
lot when I was in the sixth grade. But in seventh grade I got into Sublime.

406
00:22:52,940 --> 00:22:59,500
-Burzum. -I got into Sublime and then immediately I realized

407
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:04,180
just like, "Oh, all these songs just sound the same." -I was also super into

408
00:23:04,180 --> 00:23:08,460
symphonic metal, like the kind where they play the keyboards. -I got into chip

409
00:23:08,460 --> 00:23:13,260
tunes, dude. I just made YouTube poop music videos. That's all I fucking did.

410
00:23:13,260 --> 00:23:17,260
all I'd listen to was like Mega Man music and Block Party for some reason.

411
00:23:17,260 --> 00:23:18,860
Yeah.

412
00:23:18,860 --> 00:23:23,020
One of the... you mentioned your dad getting into front bottoms. The biggest curveball of my life

413
00:23:23,020 --> 00:23:29,100
one time was my dad was like... which it makes sense, but it was just so weird to me. I came

414
00:23:29,100 --> 00:23:34,140
home one day and my dad was like, "I have to show you two of my favorite artists." And he played a

415
00:23:34,140 --> 00:23:39,260
Girl Talk like remix. And then he was... I was like, "That's weird." And he was like, "Yeah,

416
00:23:39,260 --> 00:23:43,900
but like this is my favorite shit right now and also this and then he played Florence and the Machine

417
00:23:43,900 --> 00:23:51,660
and my dad is like my dad is like such a weird like he's such like old school like cigar smoking guy

418
00:23:51,660 --> 00:23:55,660
and just hearing him listening to him or thinking about him like sitting on his front porch listening

419
00:23:55,660 --> 00:24:01,580
to like a Kanye Rolling Stones like yeah yeah remix he's just so weird my yeah my dad all my

420
00:24:01,580 --> 00:24:08,860

421
00:24:08,860 --> 00:24:13,780

00:24:18,140 --> 00:24:20,140
My dad loved like the English beat. Yeah

424
00:24:20,140 --> 00:24:25,140
I tried to show my dad like some hardcore band like Cro-Mags or something and he

425
00:24:25,140 --> 00:24:32,260
Said he my dad would always say about like punk and hardcore that it sounded like diarrhea. Yeah my dad

426
00:24:32,260 --> 00:24:37,360
I listened to odd future tape volume two in the car. I bought it and then my dad would just say the

427
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:44,360
it. Whenever they would say it, he would look at me and go like...

428
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:47,920
It's a crazy dad move.

429
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:52,680
Yeah, well he was just making fun of how often they said it, but then he was just saying

430
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:53,680
it.

431
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:54,680
That's sick dude.

432
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:55,680
My dad's awesome.

433
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:56,680
Your dad will live forever.

434
00:24:56,680 --> 00:24:58,960
I've never seen what your dad looks like.

435
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:00,920
Yeah, I remember I played...

436
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:02,440
He kind of looks like Morrissey.

437
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:04,880
I was playing Young Thug...

438
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:07,240
This guy is weird.

439
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:08,400
What's the fucking song?

440
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:09,400
The song is...

441
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:10,400
Pull Up On A Kid?

442
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:11,400
No.

443
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:12,400
Danny Glover.

444
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:15,880
Also, that's a funny title for a song.

445
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:17,360
Pull Up On A Kid?

446
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:18,360
Yeah.

447
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:19,360
With Them.

448
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:26,280
The song, when he goes on, when he says, "Give me a head on the plane, I just call it Airhead,"

449
00:25:26,280 --> 00:25:29,160
or something like that, you know that line?

What is it?

451
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:31,160
Cameron's dad said that to him.

452
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:34,640
But I was playing that in the car, my mom, and she was like, "Turn that off.

453
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:35,640
What did he just say?"

454
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:36,640
Yeah.

because of Monsters and Men. Patrick's Calling Home.

470
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:42,560

00:28:54,540 --> 00:28:58,260
and then ministry. There's that ministry song where they open it with the

505
00:28:58,260 --> 00:29:03,180
George W. Bush intro. That taught me, when I was a little kid, that taught me not to

506
00:29:03,180 --> 00:29:08,380
trust George W. Bush. Like, I was like, my mom was like, my mom and my grandpa were

507
00:29:08,380 --> 00:29:11,540

508
00:29:11,540 --> 00:29:14,580
ministry song, and I was like, "Do you not hear?"

509
00:29:14,580 --> 00:29:17,580
Dude, I've been watching a lot of old George W. Bush.

510
00:29:17,580 --> 00:29:22,620
It's funny that people pretend like Trump is the only president who was just a fucking

511
00:29:22,620 --> 00:29:27,460
idiot, but every president ever, they're just guys.

512
00:29:27,460 --> 00:29:29,740
They're just guys who are just kind of hanging out.

513
00:29:29,740 --> 00:29:30,740
They don't do a lot.

514
00:29:30,740 --> 00:29:31,740
They play a lot of golf.

515
00:29:31,740 --> 00:29:35,860
The thing where George W. Bush, the video where he's talking to the camera, and he's like,

516
00:29:35,860 --> 00:29:38,700
"And we have to stop the violence in the Middle East.

517
00:29:38,700 --> 00:29:39,700
Now watch this drive."

518
00:29:39,700 --> 00:29:47,860
and then he hit dude that that video fucking rules it's like i like i watch that and and people are

519
00:29:47,860 --> 00:29:52,260
always like how did he how did he beat gore and carry it's like because he's fucking awesome

520
00:29:52,260 --> 00:29:58,660

523
00:30:08,340 --> 00:30:12,220
president always won. It's true, yeah, Lincoln. And then after that it's just the funniest

524

Oh that would be awesome. He would have made, he would have been the president forever.

527
00:30:25,900 --> 00:30:31,220
Yeah. He could have fucking run. Greg Giraldo. Greg Giraldo. Imagine, imagine a Greg Giraldo

533
00:31:06,620 --> 00:31:14,620
The first one. And Shemp is the vice president. That would have been good, man.

534
00:31:14,620 --> 00:31:19,180
Shemp was the, you know, Curly was not actually related to the other. No, no, no, no, no. Larry

535
00:31:19,180 --> 00:31:22,020
wasn't related. Did you know they actually hated each other in real life and murdered

536
00:31:22,020 --> 00:31:26,620
each other yesterday? Yeah, that's actually true. I just saw that in the news.

537
00:31:26,620 --> 00:31:30,620
No, Shemp, Moe and Curly were related.

538
00:31:30,620 --> 00:31:34,020
- Shemp, Smay, I got recommended a YouTube video

539
00:31:34,020 --> 00:31:36,180
called the Three Stooges Getting Hurt in Real Life.

540
00:31:36,180 --> 00:31:38,260
- Yeah, oh I watched that one.

541
00:31:38,260 --> 00:31:41,100
Dude, there's a scene, there's a scene,

542
00:31:41,100 --> 00:31:44,220
the Moe like almost beat the shit

543
00:31:44,220 --> 00:31:45,840
out of the director of the short,

544
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:48,100
'cause there's a scene where Larry got stabbed

545
00:31:48,100 --> 00:31:49,420
in the head with a fountain pen.

546
00:31:49,420 --> 00:31:50,260
- Oh my God. - And it's real.

547
00:31:50,260 --> 00:31:51,980
Like he just sits there and he's like,

548
00:31:51,980 --> 00:31:54,060
has a reaction, but it's a real reaction

549
00:31:54,060 --> 00:31:55,420
of him freaking the fuck out.

550
00:31:55,420 --> 00:31:58,500
I love that. I love old comedy. We should bring that back.

551
00:31:58,500 --> 00:32:00,500
What, like just beating the shit out of performers?

552
00:32:00,500 --> 00:32:02,500
If we ever make a movie, we should just...

553
00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:04,500
I mean, that is what Jackass is.

554
00:32:04,500 --> 00:32:06,500
Yeah, if we ever make a movie, we should do that to each other.

555
00:32:06,500 --> 00:32:08,500
It should be like the Johnny Knoxville movie with the water park.

556
00:32:08,500 --> 00:32:10,500
We'll call it the Three Cool Stooges.

557
00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:11,000
Huh?

558
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:11,500
Point Break?

559
00:32:11,500 --> 00:32:13,500
Yeah, Point Break.

560
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:17,500
Have you guys seen the previews for that new Eric Andre movie that's like pranks combined with a movie?

561
00:32:17,500 --> 00:32:18,000
No.

562
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,500
It's like he does like street bits, but it's also in a plot.

563
00:32:20,500 --> 00:32:21,000
Uh-uh.

564
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:22,500
Like it's about some crazy road travel.

565
00:32:22,500 --> 00:32:23,500
Yeah, they just did a Dirty Grandpa thing.

566
00:32:23,500 --> 00:32:24,500
Yeah, it looks fun.

567
00:32:24,500 --> 00:32:28,500
bad grandpa. Dirty Grandpa is the one where Robert Edmurs is the N word.

568
00:32:28,500 --> 00:32:31,500
Yeah. The ultimate stunt. White Grandpa.

569
00:32:31,500 --> 00:32:34,500

00:32:42,500 --> 00:32:45,500
I'm still on White Grandpa. White Grandpa.

574
00:32:45,500 --> 00:32:48,500
What would that movie be about? Sexy Grandpa. White Grandpa?

575
00:32:48,500 --> 00:32:51,500
It should be about you. Fat Grandpa.

576
00:32:51,500 --> 00:32:57,660
old grandpa yeah damn that'd be a great

577
00:32:57,660 --> 00:32:58,700

00:32:58,700 --> 00:33:01,140
movie that's just like I think we should

579
00:33:01,140 --> 00:33:03,660
put a screenplay on it right now it's

580
00:33:03,660 --> 00:33:05,740
just us Patrick's the only one who gets

581
00:33:05,740 --> 00:33:07,100

585
00:33:12,500 --> 00:33:14,420
stunts. You're absolutely the best at stunts.

586
00:33:14,420 --> 00:33:15,740

No dude you're like the

589
00:33:19,060 --> 00:33:25,140
king of snots man. You could probably jump off the house right now you could jump off of it.

590
00:33:25,140 --> 00:33:28,100
You could survive if I shot you in the head. No you would jump and you would survive.

591
00:33:28,100 --> 00:33:37,220
Patrick's evil knishes. Fucking fat bitch. I'm kidding. I know how to bread fall though.

592
00:33:37,220 --> 00:33:41,460
I used to. I can't believe we've only done half of the episode. I feel like we've done

593
00:33:41,460 --> 00:33:47,220
like ten years of content in this one episode. We've only done three. This is the second

594
00:33:47,220 --> 00:33:56,140
wind one yeah this is yeah I want to smell DVDs. I had a cup of coffee, I had a half a cigarette and I got to

595
00:33:56,140 --> 00:34:00,380
smell all sorts of smells from around the world yeah do you guys remember wait okay

596
00:34:00,380 --> 00:34:06,140
figure out where the DVDs were made that's how we create it. That is how we source it. We know how DVDs smell from

597
00:34:06,140 --> 00:34:11,260
different countries yeah between like Malaysia and China. They're all China. No

598
00:34:11,260 --> 00:34:17,100
they're not. One of them was Israel. The fighting style is from Israel. Yeah and so

599
00:34:17,100 --> 00:34:21,660
they made the DVD there too. No. Yeah. Yeah. They don't make DVDs in Israel. Oh they do

600
00:34:21,660 --> 00:34:26,140
brother and you do not want to see what they put on there. They make WMDs. Yeah.

603
00:34:41,820 --> 00:34:44,860
Yeah. Weapons of Moyshe Dershowitz. Websites of Moyshe Dershowitz.

604
00:34:44,860 --> 00:34:50,620
I have to make a website. Yeah. My boss. Caleb.com.

605
00:34:50,620 --> 00:34:53,340
No, my, well, I do have to make a website. Oh, man.

606
00:34:53,340 --> 00:35:00,300
My boss. He bought this domain. My boss fired me and then was like, not really, but I'm on leave

607
00:35:00,300 --> 00:35:04,380
from the museum. And she was like, but I need, I have this other thing that I need you to make a

608
00:35:04,380 --> 00:35:07,380
like if you know how to make a website I need you to make a website for it and I

609
00:35:07,380 --> 00:35:10,940
just lied and said I know how to make a website so now I have to figure out how

610
00:35:10,940 --> 00:35:16,140
to do that. Just use Wix. Yeah but I think she probably wants me to like not

611
00:35:16,140 --> 00:35:19,860
have make her pay for like a subscription to something. Oh then no I

612
00:35:19,860 --> 00:35:23,540
mean you have to pay. You can't just make a website and not pay for anything you

613
00:35:23,540 --> 00:35:26,380
need hosting and shit anyway. Well she has host she already has a website she wants me to

614
00:35:26,380 --> 00:35:32,020
update it. Oh I just have to like find. You shouldn't have said you could do that. Dude you should put a crazy cursor on it.

615
00:35:32,020 --> 00:35:36,560
Yeah, you should I think I might put like a chest cursor. Yeah. Yeah, I should put the mind

616
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:37,560
I know

617
00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:45,580
My face with a little triangle on the top left a jump scare every three seconds. Yeah. Yeah that children's theater is gonna get fucking owned

618
00:35:45,580 --> 00:35:51,500
Yeah, yeah, sounds good. I don't know. I feel like I can learn it can't be that hard or I can I guess

619
00:35:51,500 --> 00:35:55,860
Yeah, somebody has a code that I can just throw on there and it's probably one of the random shit

620
00:35:55,860 --> 00:36:01,460
The easiest coding is to make a web. I know how to do like some like like I know to change the color

621
00:36:01,460 --> 00:36:03,460
Yeah, I know how to do some HTML stuff.

622
00:36:03,460 --> 00:36:07,220
Yeah, you just need to know, you just need to have an idea of what you want to look like.

623
00:36:07,220 --> 00:36:11,300
You have an idea of what a pretty website looks like and then just look up how to do things,

624
00:36:11,300 --> 00:36:14,100
like how to make sidebar stick to the side and stuff like that.

625
00:36:14,100 --> 00:36:16,100
Yeah, I'll figure it out. I'll play it by ear.

626
00:36:16,100 --> 00:36:18,100
Dude, it's so crazy how many people like...

627
00:36:18,100 --> 00:36:19,060
It's so crazy.

628
00:36:19,060 --> 00:36:21,540
It's so crazy how many people, like Neopets guilds,

629
00:36:21,540 --> 00:36:27,700
like so many kids were just learning how to make websites through Neopets and they didn't...

630
00:36:27,700 --> 00:36:34,860
like my sister like all she used to do like was just code like Neopets shit and

631
00:36:34,860 --> 00:36:39,060
I don't even think she remembers how to do it. You could hack a Neopet? No it's like the Neopets guilds.

632
00:36:39,060 --> 00:36:44,100
What in the Samian are you talking about? What in tarnation are you talking about?

633
00:36:44,100 --> 00:36:47,300
I just remember my sister... What in tarnation are you talking about? My sister would go

634
00:36:47,300 --> 00:36:51,460
Oh Neopets and MySpace you'd have to code your MySpace to like get like cursors

635
00:36:51,460 --> 00:36:54,900
I do remember but yeah but that was something you just copy and paste. Yeah I know but

636
00:36:54,900 --> 00:36:56,900
But then there was other stuff that you had to do?

637
00:36:56,900 --> 00:36:58,660
I don't know.

638
00:36:58,660 --> 00:37:00,860
We should just do a Three Stooges style movie.

639
00:37:00,860 --> 00:37:01,860
Yeah.

640
00:37:01,860 --> 00:37:02,860
Like I'm talking old school.

641
00:37:02,860 --> 00:37:04,180
Yeah, black and white.

642
00:37:04,180 --> 00:37:07,140
Black and white, we hit each other with bricks.

643
00:37:07,140 --> 00:37:09,100
We're always tripping each other.

644
00:37:09,100 --> 00:37:11,860
We're all trying to fuck the same girl.

645
00:37:11,860 --> 00:37:12,860
Some beautiful dame.

646
00:37:12,860 --> 00:37:15,220
Actually some ugly white bitch from the 40s.

647
00:37:15,220 --> 00:37:16,500
Wait, who's who?

648
00:37:16,500 --> 00:37:17,500
I think it's obvious.

649
00:37:17,500 --> 00:37:18,500
Yeah, say it then.

650
00:37:18,500 --> 00:37:19,500
We're all Groucho.

651
00:37:19,500 --> 00:37:20,500
Groucho Stooges.

652
00:37:20,500 --> 00:37:27,580
I'm probably like mostly the I'm probably like I don't know much about him.

653
00:37:27,580 --> 00:37:32,340
Pat's curly I think Caleb's mo because he's a short and I'm Larry.

654
00:37:32,340 --> 00:37:33,340
He's Jewish.

655
00:37:33,340 --> 00:37:35,540
No we're all groucho.

656
00:37:35,540 --> 00:37:39,060
I think Caleb's mo because he's short and Jewish.

657
00:37:39,060 --> 00:37:40,060
I'm not Jewish.

658
00:37:40,060 --> 00:37:41,060
Yeah.

659
00:37:41,060 --> 00:37:42,060
Larry.

660
00:37:42,060 --> 00:37:43,060
I am Jewish.

661
00:37:43,060 --> 00:37:46,300
Sometimes I think what if I just started telling people I was Jewish how would my life change?

662
00:37:46,300 --> 00:37:48,300
I tried to do that in middle school.

663
00:37:48,300 --> 00:37:49,300
Really?

664
00:37:49,300 --> 00:37:53,100
like I'm half Jewish yeah and everyone just said shut the fuck up no you're not

665
00:37:53,100 --> 00:38:01,940
the teacher brings you into it my Jewish secret secret door you get secret lunch

666
00:38:01,940 --> 00:38:04,340
we sit on a throne

667
00:38:04,340 --> 00:38:10,260
yeah you have to yeah you just start getting called you start getting A's on

668
00:38:10,260 --> 00:38:16,140
all of your homework teacher winks at you and she hands you your homework oh there I did have

669
00:38:16,140 --> 00:38:21,060
have a we had a teacher named Mrs. Douche Arm. Mrs. Douche? That's what kid that was

670
00:38:21,060 --> 00:38:24,680
the joke. I feel like all your teachers had a pretty easily lampoonable name.

671
00:38:24,680 --> 00:38:31,660
They did yeah most of them Mr. Denno. Yeah. Mr. Asshole. Mr.

672
00:38:31,660 --> 00:38:36,100
Gaping Asshole. Mr. Cream Pie. Actually Mrs. Ballsack got it the worst.

673
00:38:36,100 --> 00:38:40,580
Mrs. Douche Arm was the only I think she was the only Jewish teacher at the school and

674
00:38:40,580 --> 00:38:43,980
she was like our seventh like my seventh grade teacher because we had like the

675
00:38:43,980 --> 00:38:47,940
pod system and then like a year before my brother's friends were in the class and

676
00:38:47,940 --> 00:38:51,960
they learned how to say go shit in the ocean in Hebrew but they didn't know

677
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:56,880
that she was Jewish and they said it I guess one of them like told because

678
00:38:56,880 --> 00:39:00,300
their their friend Dave was Jewish and then one of them said it to Dave and

679
00:39:00,300 --> 00:39:05,180
then he said something back and then she said something back to them in Hebrew and

680
00:39:05,180 --> 00:39:12,580
then one of them looked up at her and went you speak Jew yeah I mean that's

681
00:39:12,580 --> 00:39:18,220
pretty fair to say I think as a middle schooler. Yeah, my youngest brother, my

682
00:39:18,220 --> 00:39:22,860
half-brother, he's Jewish and not like in the technical, not because his mom

683
00:39:22,860 --> 00:39:27,180
is not, but his dad is. And the way that we found out, because he, my

684
00:39:27,180 --> 00:39:30,060
stepdad didn't even know that he was Jewish because he was raised Christian.

685
00:39:30,060 --> 00:39:34,380
Yeah. But he's like half Jewish. So he's like a quarter Jewish? So yeah, my

686
00:39:34,380 --> 00:39:40,340
brother's a quarter Jewish. So the way that we learned was his mom saw his one

687
00:39:40,340 --> 00:39:44,580
day who's like this like saw his penis and it was circumcised. So she's like this

688
00:39:44,580 --> 00:39:49,400
goofy like old southern lady. She saw him like he like put like a like a sock on

689
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:53,220
his head or something when he was like a kid started running around and she was

690
00:39:53,220 --> 00:39:58,940
like he looks like a little Jew boy and my mom was like you can't say that and

691
00:39:58,940 --> 00:40:03,300
she was like oh no I'm a hundred percent Jewish and my stepdad was just like what

692
00:40:03,300 --> 00:40:10,460
the fuck then she yeah they just like never yeah they just never is just

693
00:40:10,460 --> 00:40:14,340
something that she he never knew about himself damn yeah well that's crazy

694
00:40:14,340 --> 00:40:21,180
it's like if Patrick didn't know that he was half woman yeah but luckily he

695
00:40:21,180 --> 00:40:26,380

712
00:41:35,900 --> 00:41:39,140
beginning of the episode? That's literally what Patrick's... Patrick's apartment is

713
00:41:39,140 --> 00:41:44,260
indistinguishable from the Tosh.0 offices. The office on that show, that

714
00:41:44,260 --> 00:41:48,180
office looked very nice. It is nice. Yeah, they get a lot of money man. Yeah. I think

715
00:41:48,180 --> 00:41:52,780
yeah. It's still running. Tosh.0 is still running. It'll never end. Yeah. It's one of the...

716
00:41:52,780 --> 00:41:56,540
like he doesn't even do stand-up really anymore, he just does it.

717
00:41:56,540 --> 00:42:01,340
There was a, in my high school, we couldn't have Class Clown as the superlative.

718
00:42:01,340 --> 00:42:03,780
So you guys had Tosh, who's the Daniel Tosh?

719
00:42:03,780 --> 00:42:05,380
We did, so 2013.

720
00:42:05,380 --> 00:42:06,220
Oh my god.

721
00:42:06,220 --> 00:42:10,220
So I, my year, it was Next Will Ferrell, which I won, thank you.

722
00:42:10,220 --> 00:42:10,780
Nice dude.

723
00:42:10,780 --> 00:42:12,060
Whoa.

724
00:42:12,060 --> 00:42:13,020
That's huge.

725
00:42:13,020 --> 00:42:13,580
Nice.

726
00:42:13,580 --> 00:42:14,820
You should put that on your resume.

727
00:42:14,820 --> 00:42:19,700
Yeah, two years before was Next Tosh.0.

728
00:42:19,700 --> 00:42:20,860
They thought his name was Tosh.0?

729
00:42:20,860 --> 00:42:23,380
I thought his name was Tosh.0.

730
00:42:23,380 --> 00:42:24,380
Next Homer Simpson.

731
00:42:24,380 --> 00:42:25,380
Yeah.

732
00:42:25,380 --> 00:42:26,380
I didn't win any superlatives.

733
00:42:26,380 --> 00:42:28,420
Me and all my boys won superlatives.

734
00:42:28,420 --> 00:42:31,020
You were the popular kid, dude.

735
00:42:31,020 --> 00:42:32,760
No, I just won Next Will Ferrell.

736
00:42:32,760 --> 00:42:33,760
My friend won.

737
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:35,940
Ugliest goblet.

738
00:42:35,940 --> 00:42:43,180
My friend Alex won Takes the Most Selfies, which he was not excited for.

739
00:42:43,180 --> 00:42:45,160
That's getting flamed right there.

740
00:42:45,160 --> 00:42:50,820
But then we pulled a prank because you'd get like three comments from your friends and

741
00:42:50,820 --> 00:42:55,420
we pulled the prank and we put a kid who didn't go to the school anymore.

742
00:42:55,420 --> 00:43:00,660
So we were like, "Oh this would be funny, they won't use it." So then he, next

743
00:43:00,660 --> 00:43:06,940
semester, he came back to the school and it's in the yearbook. It says like, "Wow, he

744
00:43:06,940 --> 00:43:10,900
really does take the most selfies with that kid's name." And then he saw it in

745
00:43:10,900 --> 00:43:13,540
the yearbook and then like tried to complain to them and he's like, "That's a

746
00:43:13,540 --> 00:43:19,900
misprint. I don't..." The high school like co-op homeschool thing I went to,

747
00:43:19,900 --> 00:43:24,700
you. They did a yearbook, but by the time I was graduating, I was the only person in the

748
00:43:24,700 --> 00:43:27,780
senior class because everybody else had dropped out.

749
00:43:27,780 --> 00:43:32,860
And so I got like two pages on the yearbook and it was just like a bunch of pictures of

750
00:43:32,860 --> 00:43:33,860
me.

751
00:43:33,860 --> 00:43:34,860
Nice.

752
00:43:34,860 --> 00:43:38,800
And the girl who made the yearbook, she was like, "What do you want as a quote there?"

753
00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:42,740
And it was like right after Harris Whittles died. And so I was like, I want my quote to

754
00:43:42,740 --> 00:43:47,780
be his wheat thicks joke. And so I sent it to her and it's like, "Wheat thins call me

755
00:43:47,780 --> 00:43:53,300
when their wheat thicks, give me that wheat is the joke. And she just typed, she just,

756
00:43:53,300 --> 00:43:57,140
I like, I remember getting the yearbook and opening it and it just said, "Give me wheat

757
00:43:57,140 --> 00:43:58,140
thicks."

758
00:43:58,140 --> 00:44:02,420
That's a whole new quote.

759
00:44:02,420 --> 00:44:05,300
Give me wheat thicks. And oh, and it didn't, he didn't, she didn't attribute it to Harris

760
00:44:05,300 --> 00:44:09,760
Little. It just said, "Give me wheat thicks, Caleb Pence."

761
00:44:09,760 --> 00:44:14,180
My senior quote was Homer Simpson's senior quote, which was just, "I can't believe I ate

762
00:44:14,180 --> 00:44:15,180
the whole thing."

763
00:44:15,180 --> 00:44:16,180
Nice.

764
00:44:16,180 --> 00:44:17,180
Yeah.

765
00:44:17,180 --> 00:44:22,740
senior quote was "What's the big idea?" That's pretty good, right? My friend's senior

766
00:44:22,740 --> 00:44:27,820
quote was just "Skrrt" for like five lines. I'm really surprised they let him do it.

767
00:44:27,820 --> 00:44:32,380
It's definitely much better to just do like gibberish. Yeah, it's so much

768
00:44:32,380 --> 00:44:36,860
funnier. But I did, yeah. I was doing a tribute to my friend.

769
00:44:36,860 --> 00:44:41,460
They mixed up... They're twins at my school named Connor and Patrick

770
00:44:41,460 --> 00:44:46,180
and so they did like... That's your guys' name. They did a quote, their quote was

771
00:44:46,180 --> 00:44:49,460
like some is this the Krusty Krab and the other one was no this is Patrick.

772
00:44:49,460 --> 00:44:50,460
They fucked that up.

773
00:44:50,460 --> 00:44:54,620
And they fucked, but the yearbook fucked it up and switched them.

774
00:44:54,620 --> 00:44:55,620
Damn that's awesome.

775
00:44:55,620 --> 00:44:59,300
Yeah so it was like in the wrong order and on the wrong people.

776
00:44:59,300 --> 00:45:00,300
That rocks dude.

777
00:45:00,300 --> 00:45:01,300
Great it's so funny.

778
00:45:01,300 --> 00:45:02,300
Fuck man.

779
00:45:02,300 --> 00:45:03,300
Yeah.

780
00:45:03,300 --> 00:45:07,420
I used to take my older brother's yearbooks and just I loved going through them and just

781
00:45:07,420 --> 00:45:08,420
like scribbling.

782
00:45:08,420 --> 00:45:09,420
Write a drawing on them.

783
00:45:09,420 --> 00:45:10,980
Just scribbling on people who I never knew.

784
00:45:10,980 --> 00:45:12,540
I used to do it with my sister's yearbook.

785
00:45:12,540 --> 00:45:14,500
I did it with her 8th grade yearbook and there was a kid.

786
00:45:14,500 --> 00:45:18,180
Just because I saw that on like the intro to some like Nickelodeon show probably.

787
00:45:18,180 --> 00:45:19,180
Yeah, I had that idea.

788
00:45:19,180 --> 00:45:20,180
Yeah, I had that idea.

789
00:45:20,180 --> 00:45:21,180
Yeah, I had that idea.

790
00:45:21,180 --> 00:45:22,180
Yeah, I had that idea.

791
00:45:22,180 --> 00:45:23,180
Yeah, I had that idea.

792
00:45:23,180 --> 00:45:24,180
Yeah, I had that idea.

793
00:45:24,180 --> 00:45:25,180
Yeah, I had that idea.

794
00:45:25,180 --> 00:45:26,180

839
00:47:58,460 --> 00:48:04,140
looks exactly like you. Yeah, by a mirror. Yeah, his brother stood up. His brother was

840
00:48:04,140 --> 00:48:10,340
the only one who laughed. We all felt bad. We all were just like, "Oh, Ian." Oh my god,

841
00:48:10,340 --> 00:48:15,180
dude. How old? It was second grade? Yeah. You said? Alright. That's one of like just

842
00:48:15,180 --> 00:48:19,500
the defining moments. Just I knew from that day on, I knew I had to ask, "May I go to

843
00:48:19,500 --> 00:48:24,660
the bathroom?" Yeah, you know, and man. Yeah. I was just thinking, I've been thinking so

844
00:48:24,660 --> 00:48:29,420
much recently about, I texted you guys about this, but the kid in my like

845
00:48:29,420 --> 00:48:34,700
homeschool co-op who had some condition where if he laughed too hard, there's

846
00:48:34,700 --> 00:48:40,300
this kid, his name is Noah, and we found out like my like junior year that

847
00:48:40,300 --> 00:48:44,460
if he started having this thing where if he laughed too hard, he would just

848
00:48:44,460 --> 00:48:50,340
have a seizure and like pass out and just for like, like until I graduated,

849
00:48:50,340 --> 00:48:56,500
we just thought it was so funny and I would go I would just like every day as

850
00:48:56,500 --> 00:49:00,580
soon as I got there I would immediately make a beeline to him and just try to

851
00:49:00,580 --> 00:49:08,460
get him to pass out and everybody thought it was so funny and I was like

852
00:49:08,460 --> 00:49:12,860
and someone he always he had this one friend who as soon as I walked towards

853
00:49:12,860 --> 00:49:17,660
him his friend would stand behind him just fell backwards he could catch him

854
00:49:17,660 --> 00:49:22,620
and it got to the point where the like the principal of the place was like yeah

855
00:49:22,620 --> 00:49:26,660
you guys if I see you in the same room as him you're banned from the school

856
00:49:26,660 --> 00:49:32,620
forever and yeah I got and then I guess he got treatment for it at some point

857
00:49:32,620 --> 00:49:37,620
but recently I found like like a like an Instagram that was like run by like a

858
00:49:37,620 --> 00:49:41,060
collection of the kids like a high school like meme page for the school or

859
00:49:41,060 --> 00:49:45,740
whatever and there was like all these all these like pictures of him just like

860
00:49:45,740 --> 00:49:50,540
asleep, just like having fallen over because I made him laugh and he's just

861
00:49:50,540 --> 00:49:55,380
like slumped over like in his chair in class or whatever and just all of the

862
00:49:55,380 --> 00:50:01,100
captions are just like, "Ah, Noah's bitch-ass fell asleep again!"

863
00:50:01,100 --> 00:50:04,100
Cause Caleb made him laugh.

864
00:50:04,100 --> 00:50:08,100
Dude, it was fuckin' - I miss it, man. I miss that dude.

865
00:50:08,100 --> 00:50:11,100
And then I hosted his graduation and -

866
00:50:11,100 --> 00:50:13,100
You said a joke in the speech?

867
00:50:13,100 --> 00:50:20,540
No, I wish. No, I hosted his graduation and I was like, "Graduating is Noah and he's a

868
00:50:20,540 --> 00:50:23,180
really smart kid," and he started crying and hugging me.

869
00:50:23,180 --> 00:50:24,180
Aww.

870
00:50:24,180 --> 00:50:30,860
And I was like, "I thought that-- Do you not realize that I probably ruined your life?"

871
00:50:30,860 --> 00:50:34,220
I'm probably the reason why you won't be able to fucking pass the--

872
00:50:34,220 --> 00:50:35,220
This is Noah McGee.

873
00:50:35,220 --> 00:50:39,100
No, I wish it was Noah McGee. No, Noah McGee is stupid for other reasons.

874
00:50:39,100 --> 00:50:40,860
Damn, shout out Noah.

875
00:50:40,860 --> 00:50:42,460
Shout out to Noah, baby.

876
00:50:42,460 --> 00:50:44,060

00:50:44,060 --> 00:50:45,060
Oh, hell yeah.

878
00:50:45,060 --> 00:50:46,580
Yeah, I'll probably see him on home.

879
00:50:46,580 --> 00:50:49,180
Yeah, once this corona shit's done, bring him up here.

880
00:50:49,180 --> 00:50:50,180

885
00:50:56,260 --> 00:50:57,500

Pull your string all the way to Boston.

You're gonna say something.

00:51:04,540 --> 00:51:07,740
We should put a catchphrase box in Patrick, in his back.

893
00:51:07,740 --> 00:51:09,420
What would his catchphrase be?

894
00:51:09,420 --> 00:51:10,420

969
00:55:01,860 --> 00:55:03,820

973
00:55:14,980 --> 00:55:18,360
Whatever. Have you ever seen the Amazon Prime description

974
00:55:18,360 --> 00:55:19,360
of that movie? No.

975
00:55:19,360 --> 00:55:20,360
Say it. Say it verbatim.

976
00:55:20,360 --> 00:55:21,360
I don't know it. Say it.

977
00:55:21,360 --> 00:55:24,360
Are you just asking? Well, I don't know it.

978
00:55:24,360 --> 00:55:31,200
I don't know if they did it on purpose because of the title of the movie.

979
00:55:31,200 --> 00:55:32,200
Did they keep going "er, er"?

980
00:55:32,200 --> 00:55:36,720
No, but it's like, it literally makes no sense.

981
00:55:36,720 --> 00:55:37,720
Let's read it.

982
00:55:37,720 --> 00:55:38,720
I posted it somewhere.

983
00:55:38,720 --> 00:55:40,120

You posted your pussy.

987
00:55:44,200 --> 00:55:46,440
No, it's got to be on the streaming service.

988
00:55:46,440 --> 00:55:47,440
It's got to be like the...

989
00:55:47,440 --> 00:55:49,760
Oh yeah, the one on the TV.

990
00:55:49,760 --> 00:55:50,760

submit. I thought of this over the weekend. Okay, let me know what you guys

1034
00:58:31,720 --> 00:58:36,720
think of this. The Grinch's penis, it looks exactly like a Christmas tree and

1035
00:58:36,720 --> 00:58:39,640
that's part of why he hates Christmas is because he thinks everyone's making fun

1036
00:58:39,640 --> 00:58:42,860
of this weird shape of his penis when they see he sees the trees. You gotta save his

1037
00:58:42,860 --> 00:58:47,640
skull for the movie buddy. His penis is darker than the rest of his body. Yeah. Yeah. So what do you guys think of the Grinch

00:59:45,320 --> 00:59:49,500
This is a little teaser. I got some thoughts on Larry the cucumber. Larry the

00:59:49,500 --> 00:59:54,880
cucumber hung out with a blue worm in that movie. The blue worm? No. Janna one

1053
00:59:54,880 --> 00:59:58,960
time told me that when she was growing up a girl told her that every night she

1054
00:59:58,960 --> 01:00:03,520
would go home and stick an entire French cucumber in her pussy. What? Damn. Yeah and I was like

1055
01:00:03,520 --> 01:00:10,360
"girls are so disgusting." "Girls are so cool." "I hate girls." Dom told me that uh when she went to

1056
01:00:10,360 --> 01:00:14,520
summer camp there was like a very religious girl who handed out Bibles to everybody on the first

1057
01:00:14,520 --> 01:00:23,040
day but she was also obsessed with the WWE Divas. What? She was like she's gay. Yeah she's a gay

1058
01:00:23,040 --> 01:00:27,760
woman but she was very like she didn't understand. That's such a funny like thing to put your gayness
