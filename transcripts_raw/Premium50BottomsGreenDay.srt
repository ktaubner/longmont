21
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:02,760
It's not a costume ball.

22
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:03,760
Rudy Giuliani.

Oh my god, yeah, Rudy Giuliani's balls.

24
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:10,080
The scariest costume I could ever think of.

25
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:11,760
What are you going as, Cam?

26
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:13,480
I'm going to wear jeans and a t-shirt.

27
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:16,000
Are you going to wear a tuxedo t-shirt?

28
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Yeah.

29
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Yeah, I'm going to wear a tuxedo.

30
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
It's the scariest thing you can think of, Louis C.K.

31
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Yeah.

32
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Black t-shirt and blue jeans.

33
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,560
No, I'm wearing a tuxedo pants.

34
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:28,720
They're like their pants but they're printed.

35
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:31,240
They're made out of like t-shirt material.

36
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:32,980
Like Louis in 2017.

37
00:01:32,980 --> 00:01:39,100
They look like they have a tie on the legs.

38
00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:40,100
That's actually a good idea.

39
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:45,360
We should put up on the teespring like sweatpants and just paste like the print pattern of the

40
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:47,000
tuxedo shirt onto them.

41
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
That's not a bad idea.

42
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,240
Be like bottoms, bottom green day.

43
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:52,240
Green bottoms.

00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:59,440
be like Green Day. What are you talking about? The Green Day of pants. The Green Day.

45
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:05,560
I mean like Bottoms Green Day. Green Day didn't wear tuxedo t-shirts. They wore shirts with ties on them.

46
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:10,480
Yeah, they hated corporate culture. So that's what we would be making fun of.

47
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:17,640
Yeah, it's like Bottoms Green Day. It's Bottoms Green Day. You guys didn't

bit like yogurt and it's like green day on the bottom what great no see that's

52
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:46,560

53
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:52,880
sense dude. What if it's like it's like bottoms up but instead of up it's

54
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:59,280
Green Day. Bottoms Green Day to you. That's what you say when you're about to listen to a Green Day CD.

57
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:13,920
what you mean the yogurt with Green Day on the bottom are you talking about

58
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:18,480
those pants with the ties on them. There's so many things you could be talking about.

59
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:23,440
You just say Bottoms Green Day. Exactly. What you mean by Bottoms Green Day. That's why you guys were confused.

60
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:28,720
There's too many possible. There's three or four different Bottoms Green Days. Is it like a gay culture thing?

61
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:36,080
Bottoms Green Day? Is that? It's like a gay guy's period. It's just Bottoms Green Day.

62
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:42,480
It's like the band that's under Green Day? The band that plays under the stage while Green Day is playing?

63
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:47,120
yeah the little band that plays under the stage

64
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:54,240
a gay guy's period is when he has like katsu chicken curry the night before no

You're letting my giggles go free.

72
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:20,160
You're letting the giggles pop out.

75
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:27,000
I'm off the Strawberry Banana Puff bar, which is a vehicle in New York City.

76
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,040

I know.

84
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:37,040
The second you said that, I said, "I do not believe you."

85
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:38,040
And you were like, "No, I'm serious."

86
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:39,040

91
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:05,480
and you said you would love me forever. A little trick for people listening if you

92
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:12,480
want to get illegal vape substances in New York City, go to a Middle Eastern smoke shop.

93
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:16,820
Go to a Middle Eastern smoke shop, they just don't, they don't even pretend that they're

94
00:05:16,820 --> 00:05:17,820
not selling it.

95
00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:18,820

00:08:25,460 --> 00:08:27,460
We walked to the store pretty much.

157
00:08:27,460 --> 00:08:29,460
Hey, not everyone at once.

158
00:08:29,460 --> 00:08:31,460
Alright.

159
00:08:31,460 --> 00:08:33,460
What movie did you watch?

160
00:08:33,460 --> 00:08:35,460
Okay, who first?

Okay, Cam first.

162
00:08:37,460 --> 00:08:39,460
I watched a movie and then I walked to the store.

163
00:08:39,460 --> 00:08:41,460
To get bread.

164
00:08:41,460 --> 00:08:43,460
That's pretty cool.

165
00:08:43,460 --> 00:08:45,460
I used to have bread.

166
00:08:45,460 --> 00:08:47,460
Well, I used to have toast.

167
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:49,460
My bread used to be toast, but now I have new bread.

168
00:08:49,460 --> 00:08:55,520
have new bread. Can you scrape enough toast off toasty shit off of the top of

169
00:08:55,520 --> 00:09:00,140
bread to make it or top of toast to make it bread again? You could. Yeah I think so.

170
00:09:00,140 --> 00:09:05,420
You think so? Yeah cuz it's like I mean unless you're really you're really

171
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:11,140
scorching it. Cuz it's just getting to this. So yeah. You know what my uncle did

172
00:09:11,140 --> 00:09:16,500
that with a hot dog one time. He scraped off the burnt part? He burnt the fuck out of a hot dog

173
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:20,580
and then just like peeled it like a banana.

174
00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:25,540
He peeled the skin off a hot dog? He did that, it was like Fourth of July.

175
00:09:25,540 --> 00:09:28,900
When you say like a banana, did he peel it like with his fingertips from the top?

176
00:09:28,900 --> 00:09:32,420
Yeah, and then he ate every part that he like charred.

177
00:09:32,420 --> 00:09:37,940
That's what people will do with marshmallows, when they're roasting marshmallows too.

178
00:09:37,940 --> 00:09:41,140
That's true. They set it on fire and then peel off the outside. Those people are stupid.

179
00:09:41,140 --> 00:09:45,220
You leave the burnt outside on. The burnt is the best part. Yeah, it's really good.

180
00:09:45,220 --> 00:09:51,620
yeah yeah that's what I'm saying yeah and outside of a hot dog is also the best

181
00:09:51,620 --> 00:09:59,980
part when I when I grill when I put a hot dog on the grill I cut out all the the

182
00:09:59,980 --> 00:10:05,220
grill lines and I just eat those mm-hmm little black lines that are on the hot

183
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:09,860
dog I snored him dude I died oh they're so delicious charcoal I eat them like

184
00:10:09,860 --> 00:10:16,520
little Mike and Ikes but they taste like a burning fire yeah I put Mike and Ikes

185
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:22,160
in my s'mores what about you Pat? Yo my little brother the other day it's clear

186
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:27,480
he like just learned that somebody on like TV or something put Skittles in

187
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:31,440
popcorn because he's been to the movies isn't been in the movies in like two

188
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:35,120
years probably and yesterday I was talking to him on the phone he's like

189
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:43,820
"You know what I love my popcorn? Skittles." I was like "Yeah?" He's like "Yeah, I love

190
00:10:43,820 --> 00:10:48,040
eating Skittles in my popcorn." I was like "Do you?" and he's like "Yeah, I've been

191
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:53,260
doing it forever." I didn't even ask him. I was like "I've just been doing that forever."

192
00:10:53,260 --> 00:10:57,780
That's so funny when like a kid like learned something from a TV show and it's

193
00:10:57,780 --> 00:11:00,820
just like oh that's like that's me that's a real thing and then that's me.

194
00:11:00,820 --> 00:11:04,940
That's a thing I do. Yeah, there's so many there's so many things like that

195
00:11:04,940 --> 00:11:11,300
that I feel like I did as a kid? Oh yeah dude. For me the ultimate one was I

196
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:17,220
told kids that I ate pussy because little Wayne said it. But I also

197
00:11:17,220 --> 00:11:24,980
thought that you could see. I also love the taste. Yeah and I love eating pussy. Yeah I suppose now when I do not tell anybody that I ate pussy.

198
00:11:24,980 --> 00:11:30,140
But I thought that the pussy was something that came out of a woman. Oh

199
00:11:30,140 --> 00:11:35,900
yeah you did you told you you said that many times. I thought it was like an egg or like a like I thought

200
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:40,540
it was more of like a film. Damn baby I'm gonna eat your whole thing. Like a jello. Yeah yeah I thought

201
00:11:40,540 --> 00:11:46,300
that it was like I thought that it was like um like kind of an edible saran wrap that yeah like

202
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:51,740
like a glaze that appeared on the vagina and then you ate it off and then you had to wait until it

203
00:11:51,740 --> 00:11:58,540
came back. Until it grew back yeah. Yeah exactly. It's like a lizard's tail. Yeah women have lizard's

204
00:11:58,540 --> 00:12:03,940
tales that you eat yeah yeah yeah but that was my big lie when I was a kid

205
00:12:03,940 --> 00:12:11,900
yeah I'm trying to think I'm not sure there was probably some I feel like some

206
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:16,220
food that I probably ate because it was on it oh you know what wasn't me but my

207
00:12:16,220 --> 00:12:24,880
cousin got for his like fifth birthday he saw Scooby-Doo put chocolate on a ham so

208
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:32,020
So we got, so his birthday dinner that we all went to was chocolate ham.

209
00:12:32,020 --> 00:12:35,240
We ate chocolate ham for his fifth birthday.

210
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:36,240
That's a lot.

211
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:40,360
I definitely, when I was a, when I was little, I definitely thought alphabet soup was really

212
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:45,200
cool as I had, like had it and I was like, oh, we need to get alphabet soup.

213
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:49,320
You know what's like in the knocko from Kim Possible.

214
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:50,320
What's that?

215
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:51,320
What that is?

216
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:52,320
It's a nacho taco.

217
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:53,320
Oh, that.

218
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:55,320
I always wanted to make that.

219
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:57,320
Now they got that at Taco Bell.

220
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:59,320
One of those things where it's like people are like, "Wow, food in

221
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:01,320
the food in Miyazaki movies

222
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:03,320
looks so good. It looks so

223
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:05,320
delicious and it's drawn with love and care

224
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:07,320
but it's just all the food from Scooby-Doo

225
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:09,320
that like shat in your mouth."

226
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:11,320
Yeah, chocolate fucking ham.

227
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:13,320
It's the pasta from Elf

228
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:15,320
with all the maple syrup.

229
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:17,320
Welcome back to Binging with Babish.

230
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:19,320
Today we're going to be making the chocolate ham from

231
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:21,320
Scooby-Doo.

232
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:25,800
Yeah, the first step is you take a ham.

233
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:26,800
That is a honey chocolate glaze.

234
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:30,080
You're never going to guess what the second step is.

235
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:31,480
It's crazy how popular...

236
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:34,680
Dude, chocolate and mustard, could you imagine that together?

237
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:36,200
Yes.

238
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:37,200
Do it right now, go eat it.

239
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:38,200
Salty and sweet.

240
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:39,880
I don't know, I don't think chocolate...

241
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:43,200
I feel like chocolate and mustard do not...

242
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:45,160
I don't know, maybe I have to go try it.

243
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:47,200
Honey mustard is...

244
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:49,440
Honey's basically chocolate.

245
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:51,040
You're right, it comes from the same...

246
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:59,920
I am so smart and I just got smarted so easily. Does anybody else want to duel?

247
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:00,920
Any takers? No?

248
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:01,920
We're doing a brain logic thing.

249
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:03,880
What are you dueling me with?

250
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:05,840
What do you do with that big fat butt?

251
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:10,960
I'm going to duel you about abortion.

252
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:11,960
This is the abortion episode?

253
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:14,840
Go ahead. No, you go first.

254
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:18,000
Abortion's murder. Your turn.

255
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,200
Okay, abortion is not murder.

256
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:27,200
not you're not even in the duel. Oh it's Patrick. Yeah, wait your turn. That's how duels work.

257
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:33,560
You take turns. It's not about who's faster. Oh now I'm getting piled on by you fucking

258
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:38,640
abortion loving commies. God will never change his mind now. Abortion is okay as long as you

259
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:45,640
put it back later. Abortion is okay as long as you use the baby in a movie as a prop.

260
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:52,400
true yeah Hollywood needs as long as you as long as you use it to play the the

261
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:57,720
mole rat in the live-action Kim Possible exactly yeah that's the main that's the

262
00:14:57,720 --> 00:15:05,480
main export from play yeah is to this set of the live-action possible movie

263
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:11,360
no I honestly I think abortions okay if it goes towards if the stem cells go

264
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:16,920
towards like hair regrowth yeah or if they figure that out then I'm fine or if

Yeah.

272
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:45,880
That's ad hominem.

273
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:46,880
That's ad hominem.

274
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:47,880
Cameron, please moderate.

275
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:48,880
I'm not the moderator.

276
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:49,880
You're the moderator.

277
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:53,040
You guys are shooting at each other and missing wildly and then I walk in and I don't even

278
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:56,280
have any guns and I just point at you both and you explode like Dr. Manhattan.

279
00:15:56,280 --> 00:15:58,080
What's your opinion that makes us do that?

280
00:15:58,080 --> 00:16:00,520
I don't drink soda at all.

281
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:01,520
Oh my god.

282
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:02,520
Oh yeah, that's right.

283
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:03,520
Yeah.

284
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:04,520
I've never seen Cameron drink soda.

285
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:05,520
That's completely destroyed.

286
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:06,520
Yeah.

287
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:07,520
Wow.

288
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:08,520
I hate getting so owned like that.

289
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:09,760
Cameron's teeth must be so nice.

290
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:12,160
They're really not that nice.

291
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:13,560
God, I want to get, I want to replace my teeth with cameras.

292
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:14,400
You can get into my teeth if you want.

293
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:16,000
I want to get your teeth.

294
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,600
Gimme them.

295
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:20,560
You can have them, dude.

296
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:21,760
Come and get 'em.

297
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:23,680
I get 20 bucks from the Tooth Fairy.

298
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:24,520
What?

299
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:26,040
That's how good my teeth are, dude.

300
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:26,880
Damn.

301
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:30,600
I've had like a bump in my mouth right here.

302
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:31,720
That's neat.

303
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:33,040
It's really surprising that--

304
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:34,860
It's mouth cancer, it's the big one.

305
00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:36,560
Yeah, the big mouth cancer.

306
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:39,000
It's surprising to me that more kids

307
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:42,800
don't knock their own teeth out to try and get money from the tooth fair.

308
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:44,300
I knocked my teeth out as a kid.

309
00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:48,760
I mean like you kind of like yeah like I was fucking attaching my teeth to shit just running

310
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:49,760
around the house.

311
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:50,760
Yeah.

312
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:51,760
Just like gluing on myself.

313
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:52,760
I was a little freak.

314
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:55,520
I feel like you'd see more often like kids just like fucking clocking themselves in the

315
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:58,120
mouth just to lose like a bunch of teeth at once.

316
00:16:58,120 --> 00:17:00,160
Kids don't really like money that much.

317
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:01,160
No.

318
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:02,160
Well I, money buys toys.

319
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:03,560
No kids, it depends on the kid.

320
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:08,480
I mean I think that to like if you get ten dollars and you're like in like fifth grade

321
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:10,760
you're like, "Holy shit, dude, I'm gonna go down to the store

322
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:12,760
"and I'm gonna get a slushie."

323
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:16,240
Like, that's like the best, you could get five slushies.

324
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:17,800
It's crazy, dude.

325
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:19,640
- True, that opens the world up.

326
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:20,940
- I could go buy a toy.

327
00:17:20,940 --> 00:17:24,560
I think saying, I mean, it depends on the age of the kid,

328
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:25,960
but I think saying, have you ever seen

329
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:27,420
Ed, Edd n Eddy, dude?

330
00:17:27,420 --> 00:17:28,260
- Yeah, I mean, what was I even thinking?

331
00:17:28,260 --> 00:17:30,040
- Those kids go fucking nuts for money.

332
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:32,560
- Yeah, I mean, these kids are addicted to money.

333
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:34,240
- They're addicted to jawbreakers.

334
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:35,080
- Oh my God.

335
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:38,180
Jesus Christ.

336
00:17:38,180 --> 00:17:39,700
So you just lost another duel.

337
00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:43,660
I, another duel, another L on my belt, dude.

338
00:17:43,660 --> 00:17:45,380
You're about to have, that's four L's.

339
00:17:45,380 --> 00:17:46,220
Can we go back to our position?

340
00:17:46,220 --> 00:17:49,380
You're building your way to four L's in a certain formation.

341
00:17:49,380 --> 00:17:51,420
You're putting your four L's in a circle.

342
00:17:51,420 --> 00:17:54,020
No.

343
00:17:54,020 --> 00:17:54,860
Yeah.

344
00:17:54,860 --> 00:17:56,260
I'm not, dude, come on.

345
00:17:56,260 --> 00:17:57,340
Yeah, you are.

346
00:17:57,340 --> 00:17:58,820
No, come on.

347
00:17:58,820 --> 00:18:00,540
What else can we duel about?

348
00:18:00,540 --> 00:18:01,380
Should've stretched out before.

349
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:03,740
Caleb is gonna get a W and then he's gonna follow it up

350
00:18:03,740 --> 00:18:07,100
with an E-H-R-M-A-C-H-T.

351
00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:09,340
(laughing)

352
00:18:09,340 --> 00:18:11,020
- No.

353
00:18:11,020 --> 00:18:14,420
- He's gonna be like, "Finally, the letter

354
00:18:14,420 --> 00:18:16,300
"that completes my belt."

355
00:18:16,300 --> 00:18:18,620
- He's walking around with an air mocked.

356
00:18:18,620 --> 00:18:19,460
- Yeah.

357
00:18:19,460 --> 00:18:22,860
That's why he's trying so hard to win these duels.

358
00:18:22,860 --> 00:18:25,720
- No, I don't need that letter.

359
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:26,560
- Yeah, you do.

360
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:28,980
- No, I'll take any other letter now.

361
00:18:28,980 --> 00:18:31,020
- Yeah, right now he's got lair mocked.

362
00:18:31,020 --> 00:18:31,860
- Yeah.

363
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:36,060
- Which is kind of a funny nickname for someone named Larry.

364
00:18:36,060 --> 00:18:41,060
He's trying to get the dual stopped in the middle so he can get two S's for stopped.

365
00:18:41,060 --> 00:18:43,140
No I don't want that dude.

366
00:18:43,140 --> 00:18:45,100
He wants to put those onto his body.

367
00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:49,580
I may have said this before but the guy who tattooed me the first time was just like a

369

00:18:51,580 --> 00:18:57,100
This dumbass dude who was like my brother's good friend growing up and he's tattooing

You little, you're a little.

Which one of us looks the most like candy?

415
00:21:28,260 --> 00:21:31,260
Would you eat a one year old piece of candy?

416
00:21:31,260 --> 00:21:33,260
Oh yeah, I would.

417
00:21:33,260 --> 00:21:36,260
You would eat a one year old who looks like candy.

418
00:21:36,260 --> 00:21:37,260
No.

419
00:21:37,260 --> 00:21:40,260
You're putting words in my mouth, brother.

420
00:21:40,260 --> 00:21:43,260
No, I said would you eat a one year old who looks like candy?

421
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:44,260
No.

422
00:21:44,260 --> 00:21:45,260
No.

423
00:21:45,260 --> 00:21:48,260
A one year old who looks like a piece of candy.

424
00:21:48,260 --> 00:21:49,260
No.

425
00:21:49,260 --> 00:21:50,260
No, definitely not.

426
00:21:50,260 --> 00:21:53,340
What about a one year old candy?

427
00:21:53,340 --> 00:21:55,500
I've eaten one year old candy before, easy.

428
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:58,100
I've eaten chocolate where the whole thing was white.

429
00:21:58,100 --> 00:21:59,100
It's called white chocolate.

430
00:21:59,100 --> 00:22:02,100
No, no, you don't understand.

431
00:22:02,100 --> 00:22:05,980
It was so old that it was just stark white.

432
00:22:05,980 --> 00:22:08,980
And it tasted like shit.

433
00:22:08,980 --> 00:22:11,020
Yeah it tasted like cookies and cream.

434
00:22:11,020 --> 00:22:12,020
It was weird.

435
00:22:12,020 --> 00:22:15,780
Yeah, some of it was still black, pitch black like chocolate is.

436
00:22:15,780 --> 00:22:16,780
Yeah.

437
00:22:16,780 --> 00:22:19,420
And it tasted like mayonnaise and it was all goopy.

438
00:22:19,420 --> 00:22:22,580
And it was in a mayonnaise jar.

439
00:22:22,580 --> 00:22:25,180
Yeah, that was my chocolate.

440
00:22:25,180 --> 00:22:26,180
No.

441
00:22:26,180 --> 00:22:27,180
Oldest chocolate of all time.

442
00:22:27,180 --> 00:22:29,300
I would eat like a very old mint.

443
00:22:29,300 --> 00:22:30,300
I'm not sure I would eat old candy.

444
00:22:30,300 --> 00:22:31,300
I would eat very old candy.

445
00:22:31,300 --> 00:22:32,300
See?

446
00:22:32,300 --> 00:22:37,140
Oh boy, I'm so tired.

447
00:22:37,140 --> 00:22:41,260
I don't care about eating candy off the ground if it's still in the wrapper.

448
00:22:41,260 --> 00:22:44,620
used to give me shit for that yeah if it's in the wrapper that's fine

449
00:22:44,620 --> 00:22:49,300
yeah if you find candy in the round yeah it's in the wrapper like someone made

450
00:22:49,300 --> 00:22:54,460
what a man are we like in the hallway at school one time not like the sidewalk oh

451
00:22:54,460 --> 00:22:57,740
and the sidewalk if it's still in the wrapper and it's clear that it hasn't

452
00:22:57,740 --> 00:23:03,040
been stepped on I'll maybe gamble you know and take a bite I did I will say

453
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:07,060
recently I ate it was like a half empty pack of gum and I just ate all the gum

454
00:23:07,060 --> 00:23:12,140
Yeah, what if I like if you find like I was in the air what am I talking about when I was in the airport?

455
00:23:12,140 --> 00:23:17,940
I found the air force. I found like some trail mix on the ground. I ate that. Yeah, it had been open

456
00:23:17,940 --> 00:23:23,540
Yeah, if it hasn't been opened and it's on the ground, that's fine. No, I had find it. Oh, well, that's different

457
00:23:23,540 --> 00:23:26,160
Yeah, I wouldn't do that. Somebody's hand was probably in it. You know what?

458
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:29,060
No, cuz it I used to fucking at the skate park

459
00:23:29,060 --> 00:23:34,460
I we played a game called water bottle roulette, which is where if you went there without water and you were really thirsty

460
00:23:35,020 --> 00:23:40,500
You would just kind of gamble on whether or not you would know the waters that people would leave. I've done that

461
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:43,420
Basketball, yeah, yeah

462
00:23:43,420 --> 00:23:51,140
Trash at that at that skate park all the time. So you ever have Jack if you and your friends were there. Yeah

463
00:23:51,140 --> 00:23:56,540
Oh, yeah a bunch of white. What do you ever drink a peepee when you were doing that? No

464
00:23:56,540 --> 00:23:58,740
Do you ever drink anything?

465
00:23:58,740 --> 00:24:00,740
anything other than water I

466
00:24:01,260 --> 00:24:02,940
I think Gatorade one time.

467
00:24:02,940 --> 00:24:05,140
- Did you ever, like, did you ever drink something

468
00:24:05,140 --> 00:24:07,480
thinking it was water and it wasn't water?

469
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:08,320
- No.

470
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:10,820
- So you never lost that game?

471
00:24:10,820 --> 00:24:13,400
- Well, water becomes stagnant.

472
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:15,500
- What?

473
00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:16,620
- And if you drink stagnant water, you get sick.

474
00:24:16,620 --> 00:24:17,460
- What do you mean?

475
00:24:17,460 --> 00:24:18,280
(laughing)

476
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:19,120
- Stagnant.

477
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:19,960
- Stagnant water.

478
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:20,800
- Stagnant, what do you mean?

479
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:22,540
- That's like a pond.

480
00:24:22,540 --> 00:24:24,520
- Yeah.

481
00:24:24,520 --> 00:24:26,740
- That just means water that doesn't--

482
00:24:26,740 --> 00:24:28,820
- Stall water is not flowing through a body of water.

483
00:24:28,820 --> 00:24:30,820
- Stagnant water is standing water that's--

484
00:24:30,820 --> 00:24:37,820
okay

485
00:24:37,820 --> 00:24:40,300
it like a cup

486
00:24:40,300 --> 00:24:41,780
it goes bad

487
00:24:41,780 --> 00:24:45,460
i didn't know that that's not the word for it

488
00:24:45,460 --> 00:24:48,420
there is no word for it

489
00:24:48,420 --> 00:24:50,300
water doesn't go bad in a cup

490
00:24:50,300 --> 00:24:54,200
yeah it could go bad in the direct sunlight in a plastic bottle

491
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:57,420
i mean the bpa could leak into the water yeah that's what i mean

492
00:24:57,420 --> 00:25:03,300
that's what he means by stagnant. I meant BPA could leak into the water bottle.

493
00:25:03,300 --> 00:25:07,120
Patrick gets a glass of water and he walks around his house just

494
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:10,860
shaking it back and forth really fast the whole time so it doesn't get stagnant.

495
00:25:10,860 --> 00:25:17,400
I didn't know it had to do with ponds. No, that's like where where mosquitoes

496
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:24,340
live. Stagnant water. That's where mosquitoes thrive. Fucking stupid as shit. No, come on. Hey, hey Pat.

497
00:25:24,340 --> 00:25:26,740
We might have gone too hard on you there, buddy.

498
00:25:26,740 --> 00:25:28,940
It was really funny, but it's not your fault.

499
00:25:28,940 --> 00:25:30,500
It was probably your parents' fault.

500
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:34,100
It's probably your stupid parents' fault for teaching you bullshit like that.

501
00:25:34,100 --> 00:25:35,100
Yeah, your dumb fucking parents.

502
00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:36,100
They didn't teach me that.

503
00:25:36,100 --> 00:25:37,100
Fucking dumb ass parents.

504
00:25:37,100 --> 00:25:40,060
Yeah, it's their fault for letting you have a thought by yourself.

505
00:25:40,060 --> 00:25:41,060
That's true.

506
00:25:41,060 --> 00:25:42,060
Yeah.

507
00:25:42,060 --> 00:25:46,300
All my thoughts should be shared with your parents until you're 18.

508
00:25:46,300 --> 00:25:48,300
Yeah, like your phone.

509
00:25:48,300 --> 00:25:49,300
Yeah.

510
00:25:49,300 --> 00:25:52,700
Yeah, your parents should be allowed to look at your phone all the time.

511
00:25:52,700 --> 00:25:53,700
I agree, dude.

512
00:25:53,700 --> 00:25:59,040
Yeah, when I when I was a kid I my mom would do that shit all the time and so my it always looked like I

513
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:05,300
Had no friends and no text messages, and that's the reason why yeah, I think I think every ten minutes on this episode

514
00:26:05,300 --> 00:26:07,820
Or every seven minutes

515
00:26:07,820 --> 00:26:10,420
Caleb has said something that is that he said before

516
00:26:10,420 --> 00:26:16,420
Yes, he's repeating himself today. I'm sorry. I woke up from a nap. It's because they're calling him

517
00:26:16,420 --> 00:26:18,420
Wait, you guys got us you were

518
00:26:19,060 --> 00:26:23,920
You were napping. I was napping and I don't remember what's a dream and what's reality right now.

519
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:26,280
I might be spinning a top on my table.

520
00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:35,480
Whose dog is that? I don't know. You don't know? You don't know? Who knows? No idea. Any chance it's your dog?

521
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:37,180
No.

522
00:26:37,180 --> 00:26:43,980
No. No, couldn't be. What do you guys think I should get into MMOs? Yeah, if you could, yeah.

523
00:26:43,980 --> 00:26:46,500
Like World of Warcraft? Yeah. Do you think I should get into it?

524
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:51,100
I had to get into World of Warcraft so bad when I was a kid, but I wasn't because my parents

525
00:26:51,100 --> 00:26:54,020
would never let me like pay them for the subscription, you know what I mean?

526
00:26:54,020 --> 00:26:57,220
Like I would have to like use their credit card and then give them money and they were

527
00:26:57,220 --> 00:26:58,220
just like no.

528
00:26:58,220 --> 00:27:03,660
Yeah dude, I fucking did that with, I bought a used copy of Star Wars Old Republic at GameStop.

529
00:27:03,660 --> 00:27:04,660
That game rocks.

530
00:27:04,660 --> 00:27:10,020
Yeah, but I didn't know that you had to pay $15 a month to fucking play it.

531
00:27:10,020 --> 00:27:14,420
So I got it and I had like the 60 day free trial, but I didn't even think it was worth

532
00:27:14,420 --> 00:27:15,420
it.

533
00:27:15,420 --> 00:27:16,420
I just like returned it.

534
00:27:16,420 --> 00:27:19,060
You know what I played so much as a kid?

535
00:27:19,060 --> 00:27:21,060
The best game, uh, Adventure Quest.

536
00:27:21,060 --> 00:27:22,260
Do you guys play Adventure Quest?

537
00:27:22,260 --> 00:27:23,780
Oh yeah dude, of course.

538
00:27:23,780 --> 00:27:25,140
It was so sick.

539
00:27:25,140 --> 00:27:26,900
'Cause you can make your name into this, uh...

540
00:27:26,900 --> 00:27:28,020
Yeah, I think my name...

541
00:27:28,020 --> 00:27:29,380
I'm gonna get into Star Trek Online.

542
00:27:29,380 --> 00:27:33,380
I think my name was like Excalibur or something, but I misspelled it.

543
00:27:33,380 --> 00:27:35,700
Mine was like Mr. Diarrhea.

544
00:27:35,700 --> 00:27:36,660
Yeah, that makes sense.

545
00:27:36,660 --> 00:27:37,700
Yeah, Mr. Boombox Diarrhea.

546
00:27:37,700 --> 00:27:38,100
Why?

547
00:27:38,100 --> 00:27:43,540
That's a... I just feel like that's a pretty good cross-section of who we were like 10 years ago.

548
00:27:43,540 --> 00:27:43,940
I was like...

549
00:27:43,940 --> 00:27:45,940
Yeah, you were like Mr. Diarrhea.

550
00:27:45,940 --> 00:27:47,940
and I was like Excalibur!

551
00:27:47,940 --> 00:27:49,940
It's still what I name all my shit.

552
00:27:49,940 --> 00:27:51,940
Excalibur is a really good one.

553
00:27:51,940 --> 00:27:53,940
I played Star Trek Online

554
00:27:53,940 --> 00:27:55,940
when I

555
00:27:55,940 --> 00:27:57,940

556
00:27:57,940 --> 00:27:59,940
my username was Frazier Crane

557
00:27:59,940 --> 00:28:01,940

563
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:13,940

581
00:29:35,180 --> 00:29:39,460
MMO yeah it's true people going on and spending their time I just think it's

582
00:29:39,460 --> 00:29:45,060
It's funny to get into a role playing game like that online.

583
00:29:45,060 --> 00:29:46,060
That shit rules.

584
00:29:46,060 --> 00:29:47,060
Yeah.

585
00:29:47,060 --> 00:29:52,020
I could never play, I can't play online games that much.

586
00:29:52,020 --> 00:29:53,020
I'm not good at games.

587
00:29:53,020 --> 00:29:55,340
Cause then everyone will know that I suck.

588
00:29:55,340 --> 00:30:00,780
I feel like things like EVE though, do you have to be good at it?

589
00:30:00,780 --> 00:30:02,940
Or do you just have to be amazing and pretend?

590
00:30:02,940 --> 00:30:07,100
There's like combat, it's super complicated.

591
00:30:07,100 --> 00:30:10,020
- Because it's just like, yeah, you have to know everything.

592
00:30:10,020 --> 00:30:12,660
I mean, I don't, it's literally like a game

593
00:30:12,660 --> 00:30:15,340
where you fly around spaceships and it's like super,

594
00:30:15,340 --> 00:30:17,740
it's supposed to be like super realistic or something.

595
00:30:17,740 --> 00:30:18,940
I think it's probably pretty complicated.

596
00:30:18,940 --> 00:30:21,260
- I also played, 'cause they had it on Steam,

597
00:30:21,260 --> 00:30:23,180
I played DC Universe Online.

598
00:30:23,180 --> 00:30:25,060
- Oh, nice. - Oh, yeah, those were great.

599
00:30:25,060 --> 00:30:27,940
- Yeah. - Yeah, you make a superhero

600
00:30:27,940 --> 00:30:30,020
named Diarrhea Man. - Yeah.

601
00:30:30,020 --> 00:30:31,980
- And he's like the diarrhea superhero.

602
00:30:31,980 --> 00:30:33,300
- Yeah, and he does poop tricks.

603
00:30:33,300 --> 00:30:35,180
- And he does poop tricks, yeah.

604
00:30:35,180 --> 00:30:37,900
- For money. - You can make a villain too.

605
00:30:37,900 --> 00:30:39,580
- Diarrhea of a woman.

606
00:30:39,580 --> 00:30:41,820
- Diarrhea of a woman?

607
00:30:41,820 --> 00:30:43,740
- Diarrhea woman.

608
00:30:43,740 --> 00:30:45,100
- Diarrhea of a woman.

609
00:30:45,100 --> 00:30:45,940
- No.

610
00:30:45,940 --> 00:30:47,540
- Are you saying diarrhea of a woman or diarrhea?

611
00:30:47,540 --> 00:30:48,780
- Diarrhea woman.

612
00:30:48,780 --> 00:30:50,460
- Diarrhea of a woman?

613
00:30:50,460 --> 00:30:51,900
- Diarrhea woman.

614
00:30:51,900 --> 00:30:55,380
And she's a woman version of diarrhea man.

615
00:30:55,380 --> 00:30:58,060
But she's nasty, naughty. - So it's like bad girl?

616
00:30:58,060 --> 00:30:59,860
- Yeah, she's a bad girl, you could say that.

617
00:30:59,860 --> 00:31:01,340
(laughing)

618
00:31:01,340 --> 00:31:02,740
Like RiRi.

619
00:31:02,740 --> 00:31:03,580
- Yeah.

620
00:31:03,580 --> 00:31:04,400
Who, what?

621
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:11,400

00:31:27,780 --> 00:31:32,020

624
00:31:32,020 --> 00:31:33,280
when I was nine years old.

625
00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:34,480
- Bruce Lee's son.

626
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:35,320
- Yep.

627
00:31:35,320 --> 00:31:36,140

00:31:36,980 --> 00:31:37,820
- Yeah, he's dead.

630
00:31:37,820 --> 00:31:39,840
- He's my favorite actor 'cause of My Name is Earl

631
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:42,000
and he was a pro skater in the 90s.

632
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,360
And I thought that was the coolest career.

633
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:44,840
- He was a pro skater, really?

634
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:45,940
- Yeah.

635
00:31:45,940 --> 00:31:47,620
- But he's such a talent.

636
00:31:47,620 --> 00:31:49,360
- He's very talented.

637
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:51,960
He's a great actor.

638
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:54,640
Jason Lee, come on the podcast anytime.

639
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:55,480
I'd love to talk to you about leaving Scientology.

640
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:57,400
- Yeah, I don't think he works much anymore, does he?

641
00:31:57,400 --> 00:31:58,720
He was a Scientologist too?

642
00:31:58,720 --> 00:31:59,920
- Yeah, he was a Scientologist

643
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:01,440
and he like just left the church.

644
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:02,440
Well fuck dude.

645
00:32:02,440 --> 00:32:04,280
And he named his kid fucking Pilot Inspector.

646
00:32:04,280 --> 00:32:05,880
I've definitely talked about this.

647
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:06,880
Pilot Inspector?

648
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:07,880
No.

649
00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:09,240
I've never heard anything about Jason Lee.

650
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:10,640
I just knew he was cool.

651
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:15,040
And I got him confused with Ryan Reynolds until Ryan Reynolds became really famous.

652
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:16,960
You got him confused with Ryan Reynolds?

653
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:17,960
Yeah.

654
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:18,960
He's Canadian.

655
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:22,280
I like that you think that is like...

656
00:32:22,280 --> 00:32:23,280
Yeah what...

657
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:24,800
What the fuck dude?

658
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:27,800
You can tell Ryan Reynolds is Canadian.

659
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:30,920
I didn't even know which one you meant was Canadian right then.

660
00:32:30,920 --> 00:32:34,280
I don't know I didn't know that Ryan Reynolds was Canadian. Yeah, he's Canadian

661
00:32:34,280 --> 00:32:41,380
What what I know? Yeah, what an a D and P is you can just tell his voice you think he has a Canadian voice

662
00:32:41,380 --> 00:32:44,800
He has a Canadian accent. Yeah, it's the same as it's

663
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:50,300
Whatever his name is John Lee Jason Lee Jason Lee is from California

664
00:32:50,300 --> 00:32:54,600
He's probably let me cuz he might have a West Coast Canadian accent

665
00:32:57,040 --> 00:32:59,720
- Yeah, Ryan Reynolds, the first thing that pops up,

666
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:02,240
yeah, yeah, 'cause he's from Vancouver.

667
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:04,280
So he's got a West Coast Canadian accent.

668
00:33:04,280 --> 00:33:06,480
- Okay.

669
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:07,300
(laughing)

670
00:33:07,300 --> 00:33:09,160
- And this is supposed to be obvious?

671
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:12,480
- How can you not tell that guy's Canadian?

672
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:13,320
- I've never known that.

673
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:14,480
- How can I tell?

674
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:16,040
Yeah, there's no way to tell.

675
00:33:16,040 --> 00:33:20,780
- Canadian people, to me, Canadian people are in Canada.

676
00:33:20,780 --> 00:33:24,040
If they're outside of Canada, can't tell.

677
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:27,000
What do you mean you can't tell?

678
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,440
They start saying fucking a boot and

679
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:31,080
eating ketchup chips and shit?

680
00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:32,920
Ryan Reynolds doesn't say a boot or

681
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:35,080
eat ketchup chips in his movies.

682
00:33:35,080 --> 00:33:36,200
He does.

683
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:40,040
He never plays a Canadian.

684
00:33:40,040 --> 00:33:40,880
He does.

685
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:41,720
When?

686
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:43,080
Deadpool is Canadian.

687
00:33:43,080 --> 00:33:44,320
Deadpool's not Canadian.

688
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:45,160
Yeah he is.

689
00:33:45,160 --> 00:33:46,320
No, Deadpool's not.

690
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:47,720
Van Wilder?

691
00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:48,720
Deadpool's from Florida.

692
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:51,640
You're telling me Van Wilder is not a Canadian name.

693
00:33:51,640 --> 00:33:53,560
It's Burt Kreischer.

694
00:33:53,560 --> 00:33:54,400
No.

695
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:55,220
Yeah.

696
00:33:55,220 --> 00:33:56,820
That's who that's supposed to be.

697
00:33:56,820 --> 00:33:59,180
No, it's supposed to be Ryan Reynolds.

698
00:33:59,180 --> 00:34:00,180
No.

699
00:34:00,180 --> 00:34:01,180
No.

700
00:34:01,180 --> 00:34:02,180
Yes.

701
00:34:02,180 --> 00:34:03,180
You are so dumb about people and stuff.

702
00:34:03,180 --> 00:34:06,300
I'm the smartest guy of this people and stuff.

703
00:34:06,300 --> 00:34:07,300
Yet another duel.

704
00:34:07,300 --> 00:34:08,300
No.

705
00:34:08,300 --> 00:34:10,240
Yet another duel that Caleb wins.

706
00:34:10,240 --> 00:34:11,240
It's the one I won.

707
00:34:11,240 --> 00:34:14,540
My record's looking like WLLLLW right now.

708
00:34:14,540 --> 00:34:15,540
How many L's was that?

709
00:34:15,540 --> 00:34:16,540
Who cares?

710
00:34:16,540 --> 00:34:17,540
Three or four.

711
00:34:17,540 --> 00:34:23,100
Yeah, how can you not tell that guy's Canadian?

712
00:34:23,100 --> 00:34:24,100
I can't tell, dude.

713
00:34:24,100 --> 00:34:25,100
We can't tell.

714
00:34:25,100 --> 00:34:28,100
His brother's a fucking Mountie. It says that.

715
00:34:28,100 --> 00:34:31,100
Why would I know what his... He doesn't talk about his brother.

716
00:34:31,100 --> 00:34:33,100
He's the most Canadian guy of all time.

717
00:34:33,100 --> 00:34:35,100
No, he's not. What are you talking about, dude?

718
00:34:35,100 --> 00:34:38,100
He's like, he's like one of the most Canadian guys.

719
00:34:38,100 --> 00:34:40,100
Who? No. No.

720
00:34:40,100 --> 00:34:42,100
Yes. Not at all. Yes. No.

721
00:34:42,100 --> 00:34:44,100
I... Is Weird Al Canadian?

722
00:34:44,100 --> 00:34:45,100
No.

723
00:34:45,100 --> 00:34:47,100
See, I thought he was.

724
00:34:47,100 --> 00:34:49,100
Now look at our... Weird Al is from Linwood.

725
00:34:49,100 --> 00:34:51,100
I thought... Do not remember.

726
00:34:51,100 --> 00:34:53,100
Straight out of Linwood. I thought Linwood was in Canada.

727
00:34:53,100 --> 00:34:59,820
Canada. Yeah, I could, alright, I can see that. I thought he was a Canadian Jew. Alright, name

728
00:34:59,820 --> 00:35:03,540
every Canadian person that you know, Patrick. Because a Canadian idiot? Name every Canadian

729
00:35:03,540 --> 00:35:11,020
celebrity that you know. And we're gonna check them. Drake. Not Canadian. He's from the six.

730
00:35:11,020 --> 00:35:16,660
Not Canadian. That's the sixth state of America. Yeah. That's what he means when he says that.

731
00:35:16,660 --> 00:35:21,740
He's from Georgia. Well, you can't tell where Drake is from. Next celebrity. One day he's

732
00:35:21,740 --> 00:35:24,300
- He's a UK grime singer, the other day he's from Jamaica,

733
00:35:24,300 --> 00:35:25,140
you don't know.

734
00:35:25,140 --> 00:35:25,980
- Get his ass, dude.

735
00:35:25,980 --> 00:35:26,800
(laughing)

736
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:28,400
- All right, so Drake doesn't count.

737
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:32,660
Fucking Nathan Fielder's Canadian.

738
00:35:32,660 --> 00:35:33,500
- Not Canadian.

739
00:35:33,500 --> 00:35:34,320
- I do know he is Canadian.

740
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:35,160
- Not Canadian.

741
00:35:35,160 --> 00:35:37,140
- He says that at the beginning of the show.

742
00:35:37,140 --> 00:35:38,220
- Chris Locke.

743
00:35:38,220 --> 00:35:40,220
- That's a part of the character he's playing.

744
00:35:40,220 --> 00:35:41,780
- Chris Locke is not Canadian.

745
00:35:41,780 --> 00:35:42,620
- Yeah, he is.

746
00:35:42,620 --> 00:35:44,660
Him and Nathan Fielder are both Canadian.

747
00:35:44,660 --> 00:35:46,260
- So you think just 'cause they're friends

748
00:35:46,260 --> 00:35:47,820
they're both Canadian?

749
00:35:47,820 --> 00:35:50,540
People who aren't from Canada can be friends too.

750
00:35:50,540 --> 00:35:53,900
I should have not said all the kids in the hall.

751
00:35:53,900 --> 00:35:54,740
- Kids in the hall?

752
00:35:54,740 --> 00:35:57,340
No, they're from the hall of presidents in Disney World.

753
00:35:57,340 --> 00:35:59,500
- I would have had more fingers to point at

754
00:35:59,500 --> 00:36:00,860
if I just listed them all individually.

755
00:36:00,860 --> 00:36:01,700
- All right, next one.

756
00:36:01,700 --> 00:36:02,740
Next.

757
00:36:02,740 --> 00:36:04,760
- Next Canadian person I know.

758
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:07,180
- Celine Dion.

759
00:36:07,180 --> 00:36:08,220
- Yeah, Celine Dion.

760
00:36:08,220 --> 00:36:09,700
- She's Canadian.

761
00:36:09,700 --> 00:36:11,180
But she's like French Canadian, right?

762
00:36:11,180 --> 00:36:12,100
- Yeah, she's just French.

763
00:36:12,100 --> 00:36:13,260
- Yeah, she's French Canadian.

764
00:36:13,260 --> 00:36:14,100
It doesn't count.

765
00:36:14,100 --> 00:36:16,020
- That doesn't count, yeah.

766
00:36:16,020 --> 00:36:19,980
It's funny they just have French people in the middle.

767
00:36:19,980 --> 00:36:20,820
- Yeah. - Yeah.

768
00:36:20,820 --> 00:36:21,940
- Kind of unlucky.

769
00:36:21,940 --> 00:36:23,020
- It's a little weird.

770
00:36:23,020 --> 00:36:26,020
- Yeah, a little bit unlucky, honestly, for Canada.

771
00:36:26,020 --> 00:36:27,100
- Yeah.

772
00:36:27,100 --> 00:36:27,940
- Are you guys excited for--

773
00:36:27,940 --> 00:36:29,020
- Who else is Canadian?

774
00:36:29,020 --> 00:36:32,220
The guys from, the Alzheimer's guys, the skateboarders.

775
00:36:32,220 --> 00:36:33,500
- The guys with Alzheimer's?

776
00:36:33,500 --> 00:36:34,420
- Alzheimer's.

777
00:36:34,420 --> 00:36:35,380
- The Alzheimer's. - The guys with Alzheimer's.

778
00:36:35,380 --> 00:36:38,260
- Jazzy Faye and Birdman?

779
00:36:38,260 --> 00:36:39,380
The big timers?

780
00:36:39,380 --> 00:36:40,300
I don't think they're Canadian.

781
00:36:40,300 --> 00:36:41,500
They're from Louisiana.

782
00:36:41,500 --> 00:36:42,900
- Little Wayne is Canadian.

783
00:36:42,900 --> 00:36:44,100
- No, he's not, dude.

784
00:36:44,100 --> 00:36:44,940
- Yeah, he is.

785
00:36:44,940 --> 00:36:45,780
- No, he's from the Third World.

786
00:36:45,780 --> 00:36:47,820
- Sir John A. MacDonald.

787
00:36:47,820 --> 00:36:49,820
Stop googling Canadian shit.

788
00:36:49,820 --> 00:36:50,820
No, I didn't google that.

789
00:36:50,820 --> 00:36:51,820
You're at work right now.

790
00:36:51,820 --> 00:36:53,820
I didn't google that. I know that.

791
00:36:53,820 --> 00:36:55,820
You looked at something and then looked at me.

792
00:36:55,820 --> 00:36:57,820
My uncle said we're descendants of him.

793
00:36:57,820 --> 00:36:58,820
Do you have a piece of paper with that?

794
00:36:58,820 --> 00:36:59,820
No.

795
00:36:59,820 --> 00:37:01,820
Then what are you looking at?

796
00:37:01,820 --> 00:37:02,820
I'm not looking at anything.

797
00:37:02,820 --> 00:37:03,820
You're still looking at it.

798
00:37:03,820 --> 00:37:04,820
You're still looking at it.

799
00:37:04,820 --> 00:37:05,820
Stop looking at that.

800
00:37:05,820 --> 00:37:06,820
I'm looking at a photo of a polar bear.

801
00:37:06,820 --> 00:37:07,820
No, you're not.

802
00:37:07,820 --> 00:37:09,820
You think that's Canadian.

803
00:37:09,820 --> 00:37:10,820
He is.

804
00:37:10,820 --> 00:37:13,820
But that's his background and he minimized it.

805
00:37:13,820 --> 00:37:15,820
No, it's not my background.

806
00:37:15,820 --> 00:37:17,820

807
00:37:17,820 --> 00:37:19,820

A little bit, yeah.

It comes out tomorrow.

810
00:37:21,820 --> 00:37:29,820
It looks good. I mean, honestly, I was kind of like hesitant to think that it would be good, you know?

811
00:37:29,820 --> 00:37:33,820
Because it's like a Borat sequel.

812
00:37:33,820 --> 00:37:39,820
There's all these posters all over New York City and it's Sacha Baron Cohen wearing, like

Norm Macdonald had a farm.

He's from a bog.

Don't look at that screen.

828
00:38:43,500 --> 00:38:45,500
Keep your eyes off that screen.

829
00:38:45,500 --> 00:38:47,500
Look at me. Who's Canadian?

830
00:38:47,500 --> 00:38:49,500
[laughter]

831
00:38:49,500 --> 00:38:51,500
You can't even name another Canadian guy.

832
00:38:51,500 --> 00:38:53,500
Dan Aykroyd?

833
00:38:53,500 --> 00:38:55,500
Not Canadian.

834
00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:57,500
We should ship you to Canada.

835
00:38:57,500 --> 00:38:59,500
I would do great there, are you kidding me?

836
00:38:59,500 --> 00:39:01,740
'cause it's like a junior version of America.

837
00:39:01,740 --> 00:39:03,420
- It's just New Hampshire.

838
00:39:03,420 --> 00:39:04,960
- I don't think it's just New Hampshire, dude.

839
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:07,820
I think people are way better in Canada than New Hampshire.

840
00:39:07,820 --> 00:39:08,660
- Yeah.

841
00:39:08,660 --> 00:39:10,460
- New Hampshire's the worst place in America.

842
00:39:10,460 --> 00:39:12,240
- Don't say that.

843
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:13,080
- I'll say it again. - I don't think it's the worst,

844
00:39:13,080 --> 00:39:14,780
but I think it has some pretty bad people.

845
00:39:14,780 --> 00:39:15,620
I think some of the worst people--

846
00:39:15,620 --> 00:39:16,620
- I think it's terrible, dude.

847
00:39:16,620 --> 00:39:17,540
- Yeah. - No.

848
00:39:17,540 --> 00:39:18,780
- Some of the worst-- - Like you and your family.

849
00:39:18,780 --> 00:39:20,640
- Yeah, some of the worst guys come out of there

850
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:22,940
and try to start podcasts.

851
00:39:22,940 --> 00:39:25,100
They try to leech onto a podcast in the first--

852
00:39:25,100 --> 00:39:25,940
- Yeah, they try to leech on.

853
00:39:25,940 --> 00:39:26,780
- In the first 30 episodes.

854
00:39:26,780 --> 00:39:29,140
- I fuckin' hate how affiliated I've become

855
00:39:29,140 --> 00:39:30,900
with New England because of you two.

856
00:39:30,900 --> 00:39:31,740
- Yeah.

857
00:39:31,740 --> 00:39:32,700
- I fucking hate it. - That's true.

858
00:39:32,700 --> 00:39:34,260
- People always think I'm from Boston.

859
00:39:34,260 --> 00:39:35,820
- Man, when you're in Boston, you're like,

860
00:39:35,820 --> 00:39:36,940
"Boston's so cool."

861
00:39:36,940 --> 00:39:37,780
You kept saying that.

862
00:39:37,780 --> 00:39:38,980
- Oh man, I love Boston. - I did like it

863
00:39:38,980 --> 00:39:39,820
when I lived there.

864
00:39:39,820 --> 00:39:41,060
And then I moved.

865
00:39:41,060 --> 00:39:42,620
- Dude, you're such a-- - I saw the light.

866
00:39:42,620 --> 00:39:44,020
- No, no, no, no.

867
00:39:44,020 --> 00:39:44,860
- Yeah.

868
00:39:44,860 --> 00:39:46,660
- You're just afraid to commit to anything.

869
00:39:46,660 --> 00:39:47,940
- I think I wanna--

870
00:39:47,940 --> 00:39:50,580
(laughing)

871
00:39:50,580 --> 00:39:52,780
- The only one of us who's engaged.

872
00:39:52,780 --> 00:39:53,940
- I think I wanna move. - You're afraid

873
00:39:53,940 --> 00:39:55,540
to commit, dude.

874
00:39:55,540 --> 00:39:56,420
- I wanna move to like-- - He is, dude.

875
00:39:56,420 --> 00:39:59,060
He switches up whether he likes Boston every day.

876
00:39:59,060 --> 00:40:00,860
- Atlanta's nice. - You wanna move to Atlanta?

877
00:40:00,860 --> 00:40:03,620
- I think I might move to Atlanta and become a rap star.

878
00:40:03,620 --> 00:40:04,460
- Yeah?

879
00:40:04,460 --> 00:40:06,060
- Yeah, I might start switching lanes.

880
00:40:06,060 --> 00:40:07,180
- I like Atlanta.

881
00:40:07,180 --> 00:40:10,380
- That's one of the few other cities I've been to.

882
00:40:10,380 --> 00:40:12,160
- We should go to Atlanta and we should move in

883
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:13,780
right next to the Queer Eye guys.

884
00:40:13,780 --> 00:40:14,980
- Yeah. - Oh yeah,

885
00:40:14,980 --> 00:40:16,180
in between the Queer Eye guys and the Gold Slim students.

886
00:40:16,180 --> 00:40:17,020
- I know exactly where they live.

887
00:40:17,020 --> 00:40:18,740
- And then we can do a sitcom.

888
00:40:18,740 --> 00:40:19,780
- Yeah. - And it's like

889
00:40:19,780 --> 00:40:21,780
the queers versus the straights.

890
00:40:21,780 --> 00:40:26,100
- My girlfriend's dad used to live in an apartment next,

891
00:40:26,100 --> 00:40:30,200
like apartment building next to where the queer eyes queer eyed guys lived did they

892
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:31,200
prank him?

893
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:32,200
I think he pranked them.

894
00:40:32,200 --> 00:40:35,320
They pranked him with a makeover.

895
00:40:35,320 --> 00:40:37,820
I hate it when I get pranked with a makeover.

896
00:40:37,820 --> 00:40:42,900
We could prank them so yeah so fun dude put vaseline on their doorknob and shit.

897
00:40:42,900 --> 00:40:43,900
I wouldn't prank them.

898
00:40:43,900 --> 00:40:46,860
They try to put it in their ass dude.

899
00:40:46,860 --> 00:40:47,860
No come on.

900
00:40:47,860 --> 00:40:48,860
Come on.

901
00:40:48,860 --> 00:40:49,860
What?

902
00:40:49,860 --> 00:40:50,860
Jesus Christ.

903
00:40:50,860 --> 00:40:51,860
Who said that?

904
00:40:51,860 --> 00:40:52,860
What?

905
00:40:52,860 --> 00:40:53,860
What the hell?

906
00:40:53,860 --> 00:40:54,860
Who said that?

907
00:40:54,860 --> 00:40:57,100
(laughing)

908
00:40:57,100 --> 00:40:57,940
- Patrick!

909
00:40:57,940 --> 00:40:58,780
- You're a problem.

910
00:40:58,780 --> 00:40:59,600
- Oh, Pat.

911
00:40:59,600 --> 00:41:00,440
- It wasn't me.

912
00:41:00,440 --> 00:41:04,240
- Pat's saying that a gay guy put a doorknob in his butt.

913
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:07,220
- I'm the only one who's the ally on the show.

914
00:41:07,220 --> 00:41:08,180
- You're not an ally.

915
00:41:08,180 --> 00:41:09,180
- You're not an ally.

916
00:41:09,180 --> 00:41:11,020
- That is a lie.

917
00:41:11,020 --> 00:41:12,260
- That's right.

918
00:41:12,260 --> 00:41:13,220
- Wow.

919
00:41:13,220 --> 00:41:17,620
- Yeah, ally, you're out, that is a lie.

920
00:41:17,620 --> 00:41:19,900
- Allies all lies.

921
00:41:19,900 --> 00:41:23,420
Can I eat some of your fries?

922
00:41:23,420 --> 00:41:24,260
- Wow.

923
00:41:24,260 --> 00:41:29,220
Communism will never die.

924
00:41:29,220 --> 00:41:32,660
I need to go to the bank.

925
00:41:32,660 --> 00:41:34,260
The palace in the sky.

926
00:41:34,260 --> 00:41:38,340
I need to go to Palestine.

927
00:41:38,340 --> 00:41:39,700
And save them.

928
00:41:39,700 --> 00:41:41,340
Maybe I'll take you to Atlanta with me.

929
00:41:41,340 --> 00:41:42,260
I've said it before.

930
00:41:42,260 --> 00:41:45,140
I think the funniest thing we could do

931
00:41:45,140 --> 00:41:49,860
is if we did the New York vlog, but just went to a village

932
00:41:49,860 --> 00:41:50,940
in the Middle East.

933
00:41:50,940 --> 00:41:53,660
[LAUGHTER]

934
00:41:53,660 --> 00:41:57,020
Yeah, it's just us like pissing on the wailing wall and shit.

935
00:41:57,020 --> 00:41:58,860
Just flew to Syria.

936
00:41:58,860 --> 00:41:59,360
Yeah.

937
00:41:59,360 --> 00:42:01,160
I would respect the culture.

938
00:42:01,160 --> 00:42:02,960
I'd do the Dougie in Israel.

939
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:04,960
[Laughter]

940
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:07,160
You guys are gonna video me doing the Dougie.

941
00:42:07,160 --> 00:42:10,160
I did learn recently you can go on Birthright if you're not Jewish.

942
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:12,060
Yeah, you can go on, I'm pretty sure it's free.

943
00:42:12,060 --> 00:42:12,860
They're like trying to convert people.

944
00:42:12,860 --> 00:42:14,360
I almost signed up for it, wait.

945
00:42:14,360 --> 00:42:15,160
Yeah.

946
00:42:15,160 --> 00:42:17,660
I almost signed up, like I almost signed up as a bit.

947
00:42:17,660 --> 00:42:21,660
You have to be under a certain age, but you can go for free if you're not Jewish and they try to convert you.

948
00:42:21,660 --> 00:42:27,960

00:43:31,740 --> 00:43:32,740
You know what's in there?

965
00:43:32,740 --> 00:43:33,740
Next-gen graphics.

(laughter)

967
00:43:34,740 --> 00:43:35,740
Yeah.

968
00:43:35,740 --> 00:43:36,740
Xbox 720.

969
00:43:36,740 --> 00:43:39,740
That is, no, that is the Xbox 720.

970
00:43:39,740 --> 00:43:40,740
That is the Xbox 720.

971
00:43:40,740 --> 00:43:42,740
There's a disk slot on the way on the wall.

972
00:43:42,740 --> 00:43:44,740
Halo 5, the Halo movie is in there.

973
00:43:44,740 --> 00:43:50,380
And that's why you you gotta you got to be super secret to get in there don't they say that it's like a comet

974
00:43:50,380 --> 00:43:55,460
Yeah, there's like a meteor in there or something. I wish Christianity had something cool. Yeah

975
00:43:55,460 --> 00:43:57,540
Yeah, just like all the cool stuff

976
00:43:57,540 --> 00:44:02,800
They like they try to like they try to get rid of they're like you know there was someone will probably be like I have

977
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:04,260
a genuine

978
00:44:04,260 --> 00:44:10,100
Petrified shard of Jesus's foreskin and the church is like we're gonna send an assassin squad to kill this person

979
00:44:10,100 --> 00:44:14,280
Yeah, we're gonna get we're gonna send it. We're gonna send a molester squad to attack this person's children

980
00:44:14,280 --> 00:44:19,680
until they stop saying that they have Jesus's foreskin. Yeah they do that or

981
00:44:19,680 --> 00:44:23,760
they get like Hobby Lobby to steal a bunch of artifacts for them. Yeah!

982
00:44:23,760 --> 00:44:27,040
Honestly that's one of the craziest fucking stories that I feel like didn't

983
00:44:27,040 --> 00:44:31,480
get enough attention. Yeah the Hobby Lobby ISIS thing. Yeah, Hobby Lobby funding ISIS

984
00:44:31,480 --> 00:44:36,480
indirectly. I didn't know that. Yeah, exactly. You didn't fucking know that. Yeah, nobody knows about it.

985
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:41,160
Was it through like coupons or something? Yeah, they gave ISIS a bunch of like

986
00:44:41,160 --> 00:44:47,040
paintings that said live laugh love and like free vouchers for like like little

987
00:44:47,040 --> 00:44:52,480
like it was like they were stealing artifacts right yeah yeah they did all

988
00:44:52,480 --> 00:44:57,560
that for in exchange for like oh these are like actual like sacred texts that

989
00:44:57,560 --> 00:45:03,080
we found Isis has like Isis has hobby love like a bunch of doormats that say

990
00:45:03,080 --> 00:45:07,520
like yeah they say like welcome well this home is this in this home is

991
00:45:07,520 --> 00:45:12,640
protected by... We smile, we hug, we laugh, we love. I think Hobby Lobby is probably the funniest

992
00:45:12,640 --> 00:45:17,680
possible like store to be funding ISIS on the side. Like I think it was. It really

993
00:45:17,680 --> 00:45:21,640
yeah it doesn't it doesn't get better than that. Yeah cuz if it was Michaels

994
00:45:21,640 --> 00:45:29,240
it'd be like I knew it. Yeah yeah whatever. You know my world Michael. Joe Ann Fabrics? Nah, fuck outta here. I knew that shit was going on.

995
00:45:29,240 --> 00:45:34,720
No one goes to fucking Joe Ann Fabrics. I knew World Market was radical Islam every time I walk in and I see the rugs.

996
00:45:34,720 --> 00:45:41,720
Yeah, especially since Hobby Lobby has been trying to make caliphates all over America.

997
00:45:41,720 --> 00:45:44,720
Yeah, dude. You realize the original name was Habibi Lobby.

998
00:45:44,720 --> 00:45:48,720
[Laughter]

999
00:45:48,720 --> 00:45:52,720
Exactly. Yeah, it was right in front of us the whole time.

1000
00:45:52,720 --> 00:45:55,720
Yeah, it's just one of those things that's hiding in plain sight.

1001
00:45:55,720 --> 00:46:00,720
Yeah, they changed it to, it was Habibi and they erased the "by" from it from the end.

1002
00:46:00,720 --> 00:46:07,720
think about it. When they did buy erasure, they turned into Hobby Lobby. No! They erased the buy. No!

1003
00:46:07,720 --> 00:46:19,720
It'd be really funny to go to a gay pride parade and with a shirt that says I support LGTQ+

1004
00:46:19,720 --> 00:46:21,960
(laughing)

1005
00:46:21,960 --> 00:46:27,900
- Yeah.

1006
00:46:27,900 --> 00:46:28,740
- Yeah.

1007
00:46:28,740 --> 00:46:29,560
- Yeah.

1008
00:46:29,560 --> 00:46:30,400
- That'd be funny.

1009
00:46:30,400 --> 00:46:31,240
- People are like, I think something's missing,

1010
00:46:31,240 --> 00:46:33,600
and you sternly just like, yeah, I don't think so.

1011
00:46:33,600 --> 00:46:34,440
- Yeah.

1012
00:46:34,440 --> 00:46:35,760
- No, I don't think so.

1013
00:46:35,760 --> 00:46:36,600
- Oh yeah, I don't know.

1014
00:46:36,600 --> 00:46:37,440
- A berf.

1015
00:46:37,440 --> 00:46:38,260
- I can't imagine what.

1016
00:46:38,260 --> 00:46:39,380
- Becoming a berf.

1017
00:46:39,380 --> 00:46:43,360
A bi-exclusive radical feminist.

1018
00:46:43,360 --> 00:46:47,320
- It's kinda what I am.

the wind yeah it's like exactly what it comes to whether they exist or not yeah

1028
00:47:43,240 --> 00:47:46,840
It's like I don't really care. It's like a strand of spider silk almost

Stop talking about business dude. I hate when you talk shop with us. I'm the only one who does I get it dude

1035
00:48:06,980 --> 00:48:09,400
You do you like Robin Hood and day trade?

1036
00:48:09,400 --> 00:48:12,080
I love being the small business guy.

1037
00:48:12,080 --> 00:48:16,160
The first time that we made like over $100 on Patreon, I really did think it'd be funny

1038
00:48:16,160 --> 00:48:21,120
to somehow turn that into like a negative $5 million on Robinhood.

1039
00:48:21,120 --> 00:48:24,240
I don't understand how that happens at all.

1040
00:48:24,240 --> 00:48:29,840
Kids get their allowance, they get like $20 and then they bet that the Apple stock will

1041
00:48:29,840 --> 00:48:35,720
go up 1% tomorrow and then it doesn't and they lose $50 billion.

1042
00:48:35,720 --> 00:48:39,960
was that guy that guy who killed himself because uh cuz that happened cuz he like

1043
00:48:39,960 --> 00:48:45,840
he put it like some money into Robin Hood and then it like it crashed and like he

1044
00:48:45,840 --> 00:48:48,840
list like looked at his balance and it was like negative a trillion dollars or

1045
00:48:48,840 --> 00:48:52,240
something and he just instantly killed himself and then it found and then found

1046
00:48:52,240 --> 00:48:55,640
out then like they found out after that it was like oh it was like a glitch or

1047
00:48:55,640 --> 00:49:00,720
something oh my god yeah it was yeah yeah it was that it was that basically

1048
00:49:00,720 --> 00:49:04,480
whenever that happens the thing that people do is they like settle with

1049
00:49:04,480 --> 00:49:09,280
Robin Hood yeah like a much smaller amount of money yeah yeah so you would

1050
00:49:09,280 --> 00:49:13,240
have had to pay like a couple thousand dollars. That seems like a fucking evil app.

1051
00:49:13,240 --> 00:49:18,760
Of course yeah now people the stock market is made for computers it's not

1052
00:49:18,760 --> 00:49:26,160
made for people yeah yeah no it's fragile yeah yeah yeah yeah that's why we're poor

1053
00:49:26,160 --> 00:49:30,600
yeah mm-hmm yeah cuz we're not computers yeah there's not enough computers doing

1054
00:49:30,600 --> 00:49:31,560
the stock market.

1055
00:49:31,560 --> 00:49:33,640
See, that's the problem.

1056
00:49:33,640 --> 00:49:36,040
- Maybe we should get into Bitcoin mining.

1057
00:49:36,040 --> 00:49:37,880
- Yeah, maybe.

1058
00:49:37,880 --> 00:49:39,640
- I've been mining you guys for Bitcoin

1059
00:49:39,640 --> 00:49:40,600
since the day we met.

1060
00:49:40,600 --> 00:49:43,600
- I feel like I don't have antivirus software on my computer.

1061
00:49:43,600 --> 00:49:45,560
- I might be able to.

1062
00:49:45,560 --> 00:49:48,720
- I'm sure there's Bitcoin miners on my computer.

1063
00:49:48,720 --> 00:49:51,720
- I might have a Bitcoin in my brain.

1064
00:49:51,720 --> 00:49:54,220
- Yeah, I have a Bitcoin in my pocket.

1065
00:49:54,220 --> 00:49:58,000
- Bitcoin, whatever happened to big coins?

1066
00:49:58,000 --> 00:49:59,160
- That's right.

1067
00:49:59,160 --> 00:50:00,440
- That's right.

1068
00:50:00,440 --> 00:50:02,800
You bite them to test if they're real gold.

1069
00:50:02,800 --> 00:50:05,320
Yeah, and it turns out they're just digital.

1070
00:50:05,320 --> 00:50:06,680
Do I still have that coin?

1071
00:50:06,680 --> 00:50:08,920
Yeah, I do.

1072
00:50:08,920 --> 00:50:09,760
What coin?

1073
00:50:09,760 --> 00:50:10,580
You still have your big coin?

1074
00:50:10,580 --> 00:50:13,520
I have my, it's one of those quarters,

1075
00:50:13,520 --> 00:50:15,760
like a 60s quarter that has silver in it.

1076
00:50:15,760 --> 00:50:17,280
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

1077
00:50:17,280 --> 00:50:19,280
I remember talking to my dad,

1078
00:50:19,280 --> 00:50:21,480
my dad was really into coin collection as a kid,

1079
00:50:21,480 --> 00:50:24,480
and he was like, he kept it for a long time,

1080
00:50:24,480 --> 00:50:26,720
and one day I was like, oh yeah, I wanna see all the coins,

1081
00:50:26,720 --> 00:50:29,040
and he pulled them out and he showed them all to me,

1082
00:50:29,040 --> 00:50:32,320
And it was like probably a hundred quarters worth or whatever.

1083
00:50:32,320 --> 00:50:34,680
And I was like, "Whoa, dad, this is so cool.

1084
00:50:34,680 --> 00:50:36,560
"Like how much is this worth now?"

1085
00:50:36,560 --> 00:50:39,160
And he's like, "Probably about like a hundred quarters."

1086
00:50:39,160 --> 00:50:40,960
(laughing)

1087
00:50:40,960 --> 00:50:42,560
- Yeah, I remember when I was a kid,

1088
00:50:42,560 --> 00:50:45,080
I had one of the, I had like a big like,

1089
00:50:45,080 --> 00:50:48,560
like board that was like a map of the US

1090
00:50:48,560 --> 00:50:51,480
and like you put, it has holes for quarters in every state.

1091
00:50:51,480 --> 00:50:52,840
- Oh yeah. - So you try to fill it up.

1092
00:50:52,840 --> 00:50:53,680
And I just remember being like,

1093
00:50:53,680 --> 00:50:54,800
"Like this is so cool."

1094
00:50:54,800 --> 00:50:56,640
And like getting like a bunch of quarters.

1095
00:50:56,640 --> 00:50:57,840
And then it's like a few weeks later,

1096
00:50:57,840 --> 00:51:08,280
me like I want ice cream and just like empty that the whole thing.

1097
00:51:08,280 --> 00:51:09,280
That's funny yeah.

1098
00:51:09,280 --> 00:51:10,280
Hell yeah.

1099
00:51:10,280 --> 00:51:13,980
There's just a point where it's like I don't what am I gonna do with these they're not

1100
00:51:13,980 --> 00:51:14,980
even great.

1101
00:51:14,980 --> 00:51:17,100
Did you guys collect anything when you were young?

1102
00:51:17,100 --> 00:51:19,740
I collected dead bugs.

1103
00:51:19,740 --> 00:51:21,420
Oh I collected VHS tapes.

1104
00:51:21,420 --> 00:51:25,140
I collected my mom's hair in high school though.

1105
00:51:25,140 --> 00:51:26,140
Yeah no.

1106
00:51:26,140 --> 00:51:32,680
VHS tapes? Yeah I still have all of them. I feel like that's not collecting as much

1107
00:51:32,680 --> 00:51:37,060
as it's just like getting you just have movies yeah I would buy I would buy like

1108
00:51:37,060 --> 00:51:42,260
weird ones. I mean I get I try to I wouldn't I try to get weird books and

1109
00:51:42,260 --> 00:51:44,980
stuff but I wouldn't say it call it collecting I think it's collecting if

1110
00:51:44,980 --> 00:51:51,420
it's like I have over like a hundred. A hundred VHS tapes? Over a hundred. You could

1111
00:51:51,420 --> 00:51:52,580
- You could build a chair.

1112
00:51:52,580 --> 00:51:55,180
- Yeah, I think it's close to like 150.

1113
00:51:55,180 --> 00:51:57,020
- You could build a throne.

1114
00:51:57,020 --> 00:51:57,860
- Something like that.

1115
00:51:57,860 --> 00:51:59,300
- You could build a blockbuster.

1116
00:51:59,300 --> 00:52:02,140
- I could, I could have a blockbuster.

1117
00:52:02,140 --> 00:52:04,380
I have kids on VHS.

1118
00:52:04,380 --> 00:52:06,340
That movie, F'd Up.

1119
00:52:06,340 --> 00:52:07,180
- That's--

1120
00:52:07,180 --> 00:52:08,020
- That movie's a freak for real.

1121
00:52:08,020 --> 00:52:09,820
- That's a bad thing, I admit.

1122
00:52:09,820 --> 00:52:10,700
- Why?

1123
00:52:10,700 --> 00:52:12,340
- I got kids on VHS.

1124
00:52:12,340 --> 00:52:13,940
(laughing)

1125
00:52:13,940 --> 00:52:15,300
- Don't say that.

1126
00:52:15,300 --> 00:52:16,300
- I have Harmony Kareem's kids.

1127
00:52:16,300 --> 00:52:20,260
- I tried to start a rock collection as a kid,

1128
00:52:20,260 --> 00:52:22,360
but there aren't any cool rocks around my town.

1129
00:52:22,360 --> 00:52:25,360
So it just had like a chunk of asphalt and like a few pebbles.

1130
00:52:25,360 --> 00:52:26,200
(laughs)

1131
00:52:26,200 --> 00:52:29,160
I was like, I found a pure black rock.

1132
00:52:29,160 --> 00:52:30,580
It's just like part of the road.

1133
00:52:30,580 --> 00:52:31,420
Yeah.

1134
00:52:31,420 --> 00:52:34,380
A chunk of dirt that's really hard.

1135
00:52:34,380 --> 00:52:36,180
Yeah.

1136
00:52:36,180 --> 00:52:37,940
The one cool rock that I found was I found,

1137
00:52:37,940 --> 00:52:39,700
I one time when I was in Montana, I found--

1138
00:52:39,700 --> 00:52:40,540
- You found this arrowhead.

1139
00:52:40,540 --> 00:52:42,680
- I found sand, I did have some arrowheads.

1140
00:52:42,680 --> 00:52:43,520
- Oh, you did?

1141
00:52:43,520 --> 00:52:44,340
- Yeah.

1142
00:52:44,340 --> 00:52:45,180
And I had a shark tooth too.

1143
00:52:45,180 --> 00:52:47,300
And now I'm just remembering all this stuff I collected,

1144
00:52:47,300 --> 00:52:49,540
but I found some sand that got struck by lightning

1145
00:52:49,540 --> 00:52:52,620
and turned into like glass and it was like bubbles of glass.

1146
00:52:52,620 --> 00:52:53,460
Pretty cool.

1147
00:52:53,460 --> 00:52:54,280
- Whoa.

1148
00:52:54,280 --> 00:52:55,980
- The only cool rock I ever found.

1149
00:52:55,980 --> 00:52:58,180
- That is cool, bubbles of glass.

1150
00:52:58,180 --> 00:52:59,900
- You know what I had a lot of was,

1151
00:52:59,900 --> 00:53:04,900
I would buy like the tapes that they would show at school.

1152
00:53:04,900 --> 00:53:07,220
You know, like the like anti-smoking ones.

1153
00:53:07,220 --> 00:53:09,120
- Yeah, 'cause you wanted to learn.

1154
00:53:09,120 --> 00:53:11,460
- Yeah, I wanted to learn how to not smoke.

1155
00:53:11,460 --> 00:53:14,260
But I found one that was like a Scientology funded

1156
00:53:14,260 --> 00:53:16,580
anti-smoking video, which is pretty cool.

1157
00:53:16,580 --> 00:53:17,420
And then I--

1158
00:53:17,420 --> 00:53:18,340
- Did you try to like funnel the kids

1159
00:53:18,340 --> 00:53:19,980
into Scientology at the end?

1160
00:53:19,980 --> 00:53:21,680
- All the children, I looked it up,

1161
00:53:21,680 --> 00:53:25,300
all the children who are in the video are Scientologists.

1162
00:53:25,300 --> 00:53:27,420
- And that's it?

1163
00:53:27,420 --> 00:53:29,100
- I guess that's it.

1164
00:53:29,100 --> 00:53:31,820
- They don't, yeah, they don't try and turn them crazy.

1165
00:53:31,820 --> 00:53:34,100
- Let me look up Scientology anti-smoking.

1166
00:53:34,100 --> 00:53:37,660
- I love when you look stuff up when we're recording.

1167
00:53:37,660 --> 00:53:39,660
- Yeah, it's always the best, dude.

1168
00:53:39,660 --> 00:53:40,500
- Yeah.

1169
00:53:40,500 --> 00:53:46,340
I remember, I'd try to get weird DVDs like that

1170
00:53:46,340 --> 00:53:48,020
when I'm at used bookstores and shit.

1171
00:53:48,020 --> 00:53:49,740
they always have really good DVDs.

1172
00:53:49,740 --> 00:53:51,360
I remember we watched one of them, Caleb,

1173
00:53:51,360 --> 00:53:54,200
that was like a Dungeons and Dragons movie,

1174
00:53:54,200 --> 00:53:56,000
but it was like the fourth in a series,

1175
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:57,720
so it just made no sense at all.

1176
00:53:57,720 --> 00:53:59,280
- Yeah, it was so sick.

1177
00:53:59,280 --> 00:54:00,120
- It was so awesome.

1178
00:54:00,120 --> 00:54:01,720
- It was like one of the worst fight scenes

1179
00:54:01,720 --> 00:54:02,560
I've ever seen, isn't it?

1180
00:54:02,560 --> 00:54:03,540
- Yeah. - Yeah.

1181
00:54:03,540 --> 00:54:05,520
- They had an evil wizard. - That sounds fun.

1182
00:54:05,520 --> 00:54:06,360
- Very cool.

1183
00:54:06,360 --> 00:54:07,240
- Yeah, they did have an evil wizard

1184
00:54:07,240 --> 00:54:08,680
in that Dungeons and Dragons movie.

1185
00:54:08,680 --> 00:54:09,520
- Yeah, pretty interesting.

1186
00:54:09,520 --> 00:54:11,760
- I do remember that, yeah, that was crazy.

1187
00:54:11,760 --> 00:54:12,600
Really took me by surprise.

1188
00:54:12,600 --> 00:54:14,600
- I would never even imagine that they would have that.

1189
00:54:14,600 --> 00:54:17,400
- I have, I got some DVD that I haven't watched yet

1190
00:54:17,400 --> 00:54:22,080
that's called like UFOs and the Bible. I think it's over here. That's cool. I had

1191
00:54:22,080 --> 00:54:28,680
yeah I had like I didn't collect this but I watched I had a bunch of DVDs when I

1192
00:54:28,680 --> 00:54:33,920
was a kid that were like proof that dinosaurs still existed. Yeah. Because I

1193
00:54:33,920 --> 00:54:37,880
was like that kind of Christian growing up. Answers in Genesis presents aliens

1194
00:54:37,880 --> 00:54:42,680
UFOs and the Bible are we alone in the universe featuring Gary Bates. Answers in

1195
00:54:42,680 --> 00:54:46,760
Genesis I think is the same company that did all those dinosaur DVDs.

1196
00:54:46,760 --> 00:54:52,760
that that's the the Kinn what's his fucking name? Ken Burns? No, Ken something.

1197
00:54:52,760 --> 00:54:59,960
Ken Bone? He's some Australian fuck who like lives in Tennessee and does all this

1198
00:54:59,960 --> 00:55:07,560
like like they built like a full-scale model of Noah's Ark. That's sick. In Tennessee.

1199
00:55:07,560 --> 00:55:12,760
It's a creation science museum. Damn. Yeah. Yeah so when I was growing up my

1200
00:55:12,760 --> 00:55:17,900
mom was super into all that. Is that the museum that Mark Maron talks about

1201
00:55:17,900 --> 00:55:23,920
in his special? Yeah. Yeah Mark Maron went there for an episode of WTF and it's

1202
00:55:23,920 --> 00:55:30,860
him just walking around he's like "not true, not true, bullshit, what the fuck, it's just complete

1203
00:55:30,860 --> 00:55:37,920
horseshit." He's going up to the dinosaur statues and going "so who

1204
00:55:37,920 --> 00:55:43,920
warrior guys he's getting really mad when they're not responding to him Adam and

1205
00:55:43,920 --> 00:55:49,920
Eve bro yeah yeah yeah Adam and Steve yeah those are my guys yeah yeah it's

1206
00:55:49,920 --> 00:55:56,640
madam and Steve not Adam and Eve the boy was a girl and the girl was a boy yeah

1207
00:55:56,640 --> 00:56:02,400
do you think their names are really Adam and Eve no no what I know in Turkish

1208
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:13,560
Adam means guy what's Eve mean? Girl. Wow. Wait let me look that up. So you think they were Turks?

1209
00:56:13,560 --> 00:56:19,160
I think the world comes from Turkish. I think everything in the world is Turkish I mean look at a see what's

1210
00:56:19,160 --> 00:56:23,600
that guy that the chef on Instagram who makes the big food? I would love to

1211
00:56:23,600 --> 00:56:28,400
become like a like a Turkish chef guy on Instagram. I know I want to become like a

1212
00:56:28,400 --> 00:56:34,200
Balkan nationalist. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That'd be so funny. I think that's kind of played

1213
00:56:34,200 --> 00:56:42,000
out. Is it? Yeah. Oh. I think so. My bad. I feel like that's the, that's the thing that

1214
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:48,280
everyone does as a joke online now, right? I didn't know that. Girl is cuz and then guy

1215
00:56:48,280 --> 00:56:57,760
is a dom. Adam and cousin? Adam and cuz. Damn. Those dogs are loud as shit. I don't think

1216
00:56:57,760 --> 00:57:01,380
- So, I think you're right.

1217
00:57:01,380 --> 00:57:02,220
- Yeah.

1218
00:57:02,220 --> 00:57:06,240
- We should maybe go to the Creation Science Museum sometime.

1219
00:57:06,240 --> 00:57:07,440
Might be a worthwhile trip.

1220
00:57:07,440 --> 00:57:09,840
- It's definitely still open right now.

1221
00:57:09,840 --> 00:57:10,920
- Yeah.

1222
00:57:10,920 --> 00:57:11,760
- I feel like if any place is gonna--

1223
00:57:11,760 --> 00:57:13,520
- It definitely has a zero mass tolerance policy.

1224
00:57:13,520 --> 00:57:14,360
- Yeah.

1225
00:57:14,360 --> 00:57:18,680
- It's cool that stuff like that gets made

1226
00:57:18,680 --> 00:57:22,960
and not like funding for cancer research.

1227
00:57:22,960 --> 00:57:23,800
- Dude, let's go, let's fly.

1228
00:57:23,800 --> 00:57:24,640
- Oh yeah.

1229
00:57:24,640 --> 00:57:25,480
- And not like--

1230
00:57:25,480 --> 00:57:26,320
- All right, let's get into it.

1231
00:57:26,320 --> 00:57:36,040
like the Snyder cut and yeah that's right - that those are my two issues. I think it's kind of interesting that that st. Jude's got this huge grant from the

1232
00:57:36,040 --> 00:57:42,120
government yet Zack Snyder's cut is still hidden somewhere in the Disney vault. It's still hidden and we have to

1233
00:57:42,120 --> 00:57:46,520
watch it on HBO Max and it's not distributed freely yeah okay this makes

1234
00:57:46,520 --> 00:57:49,800
sense you think you think they would really think Donald Trump will get a

1235
00:57:49,800 --> 00:57:53,320
second term if instead of sending out a second stimulus check he sends the Snyder

1236
00:57:53,320 --> 00:57:58,520
cut to every family in America. Yes, yeah like Netflix style. Like back in the day on a DVD.

1237
00:57:58,520 --> 00:58:02,560
Yeah but you don't have to send it back. Dude Trump's gonna bring back Netflix

1238
00:58:02,560 --> 00:58:07,360
DVDs to your house. He's gonna bring back sending it. We're bringing DVDs back.

1239
00:58:07,360 --> 00:58:14,080
We're bringing Netflix DVD back. We're coming back. The beautiful. Netflix DVD. Netflix DVD. You can set up your

1240
00:58:14,080 --> 00:58:19,080

1241
00:58:19,080 --> 00:58:25,200

1242
00:58:25,200 --> 00:58:30,760

1243
00:58:30,760 --> 00:58:36,200
so I would I knew how to edit the queue so I would like she would be like oh I'm

1244
00:58:36,200 --> 00:58:39,440
going to buy like this DVD this month and I would go into the queue and then put

1245
00:58:39,440 --> 00:58:44,680
like the DC video or like toy machine I kept getting that how long were those

1246
00:58:44,680 --> 00:58:49,880
videos. Those videos are like an hour long. Okay. Something like that. Jump off a building

1247
00:58:49,880 --> 00:58:53,960
is like 30 minutes. I was saying yeah just like replacing your mom's movie with like a 10 minute

1248
00:58:53,960 --> 00:59:01,000
video. Yeah. Mom I got the Numa Numa Dance as one of the DVDs this week. Just watching it once.

1249
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:08,440
Dude at CEX and Downtown Crossing I found a DVD that was like of viral videos. That's so

1250
00:59:08,440 --> 00:59:13,160
sick. It was like made in like '04. Yeah I wish I did. I could probably just find it on eBay for

1251
00:59:13,160 --> 00:59:17,720
like a dollar but it was like this video has the Numa Numa guy, the hamster dance.

1252
00:59:17,720 --> 00:59:19,000
Evolution of dance dude.

1253
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:23,480
Yeah all that shit like they put all the youtube videos onto dvds and then sold it to people.

1254
00:59:23,480 --> 00:59:24,600
It's so cool.

1255
00:59:24,600 --> 00:59:28,360
Yeah it's like why why do you go buy the Numa Numa guy?

1256
00:59:28,360 --> 00:59:35,880
That's exclusively for for a parent to buy to give to their pastor to show to show what

1257
00:59:35,880 --> 00:59:37,320
their child is watching.

1258
00:59:37,320 --> 00:59:41,320
Yeah to get him to yeah to condemn the child to hell.

1259
00:59:41,320 --> 00:59:41,820
Yeah.

1260
00:59:42,920 --> 00:59:47,960
Yeah, you can just imagine a pastor sitting in like his back office just like

1261
00:59:47,960 --> 00:59:50,920
watching the Numa Numa guy and just going "Oh my god!"

1262
00:59:50,920 --> 00:59:53,960
Yeah, just doing the cross on his chest.

1263
00:59:53,960 --> 00:59:55,880
Yeah, he thinks it's like rock and roll.

1264
00:59:55,880 --> 00:59:56,120
Yeah.

1265
00:59:56,120 --> 00:59:57,000
"Oh lord!

1266
00:59:57,000 --> 01:00:00,520
Paul, can we let our children watch this?"

1267
01:00:00,520 --> 01:00:02,280
One of the like...

1268
01:00:02,280 --> 01:00:07,640
"I saw a man! I saw a man who said a chocolate rain was gonna fall down from the heavens!"

1269
01:00:07,640 --> 01:00:10,600
"He's a false prophet!"

1270
01:00:10,600 --> 01:00:14,920
He's a false prophet, I tell you! He said a chocolate rain was gonna fall down!

1271
01:00:14,920 --> 01:00:19,320
He said some will stay dry and others will feel the pain! Who is he talking about?

1272
01:00:19,320 --> 01:00:24,600
One of the uh one of the other members of the congregation here is like laughing from the

1273
01:00:24,600 --> 01:00:28,440
back room. It's like what's going on? And walks in and he's just like looking so guilty and just

1274
01:00:28,440 --> 01:00:32,600
sitting there with a blue screen on the tv and like I was just thinking about something about

1275
01:00:32,600 --> 01:00:37,320
the bible but you know he's watching viral videos. You know he's watching those viral videos.

1276
01:00:37,880 --> 01:00:42,680
So somebody, they hear laughing, they go into the back room and then as soon as they walk in,

1277
01:00:42,680 --> 01:00:46,360
the fucking dramatic chipmunk looks at the screen and he goes back at the person.

1278
01:00:46,360 --> 01:00:56,200
Oh fuck. I always just, or I kept ordering the Endless Summer, you know that like surf

1279
01:00:56,200 --> 01:01:00,040
documentary? I just kept ordering that because there's a scene where they're on like a topless

1280
01:01:00,040 --> 01:01:04,760
beach. Oh yeah? Yeah. I ordered that movie probably five or six times. That's probably

1281
01:01:04,760 --> 01:01:08,040
the weirdest movie for you that you probably jacked off to and watched the

1282
01:01:08,040 --> 01:01:13,880
nude scene over and over again but for me it was the man with two brains because

1283
01:01:13,880 --> 01:01:19,400
there's a shot of one boob and I paused it. There's literally a shot of one boob.

1284
01:01:19,400 --> 01:01:23,640
That's like in Hackers. There's one frame where you can see Angelina Jolie's

1285
01:01:23,640 --> 01:01:27,280
nipple and it moved like bullet time when I was a kid and then I watched it.

1286
01:01:27,280 --> 01:01:30,680
Like I thought that it was like a scene that was just like a close-up of her

1287
01:01:30,680 --> 01:01:34,240
tits and then I watched it recently and yeah it's like one single frame as she

1288
01:01:34,240 --> 01:01:38,480
walks across a room and when I was a kid I was like this is this is the most

1289
01:01:38,480 --> 01:01:43,060
jack-off able thing yeah yeah yeah yeah same with the man with two brains I'd

1290
01:01:43,060 --> 01:01:48,160
like to check it off to the man with two brains yeah you wish you literally

1291
01:01:48,160 --> 01:01:52,720
two men would give you brain Martin command performance in that movie it's a

1292
01:01:52,720 --> 01:01:56,640
it's a really underrated one I don't think I've seen it yeah I haven't either

1293
01:01:56,640 --> 01:02:02,800
so good I think Merv Griffin's I can't watch it now cuz I'll just be

1294
01:02:02,800 --> 01:02:08,000
to this. I ruined the man with two brains for everybody there's gonna be letterbox

1295
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:11,840
reviews like yeah Patrick jacked off to this. Yeah it's like your dad's Sports

1299
01:02:25,480 --> 01:02:29,680
was a kid I did think Sports Illustrated was just like porn. Yeah. I didn't even

1300
01:02:29,680 --> 01:02:33,760
know it was a sports magazine yeah yeah I was like yeah it's like yeah boy I

1301
01:02:33,760 --> 01:02:40,680
thought that with men's health there's a woman on the day you did one time there's

01:02:40,680 --> 01:02:45,400
a woman on the cover of it one time and my dad said I couldn't read it no that

Chris Morris is that a Chris Morris book?

1306
01:02:58,640 --> 01:03:04,400
Patrick, you should one time you should try you you should see if you can read a

1307
01:03:04,400 --> 01:03:07,440
book that's not about a TV show that you like.

1308
01:03:07,440 --> 01:03:10,960
I challenge you. I have a mind exploitation.

1309
01:03:10,960 --> 01:03:14,880
That's but that is you got that because of a TV show that you like.

1310
01:03:14,880 --> 01:03:17,120
So?

1311
01:03:17,120 --> 01:03:21,040
People turn TV shows into TV shows all the time.

1312
01:03:21,040 --> 01:03:23,360
You don't have to do the challenge. I'm just challenging you. If you don't you're

1313
01:03:23,360 --> 01:03:25,520
a coward but that's not my problem.

1314
01:03:25,520 --> 01:03:27,920
I dare you to read the Quran.

1315
01:03:27,920 --> 01:03:28,920
Yeah?

1316
01:03:28,920 --> 01:03:29,920
Yeah.

1317
01:03:29,920 --> 01:03:31,600
Oh, don't even try.

1318
01:03:31,600 --> 01:03:32,600
Without vomiting.

1319
01:03:32,600 --> 01:03:42,440
I was going to say I have another book here, but it's the Gary Shanling book that my brother

1320
01:03:42,440 --> 01:03:44,440
gave me.

1321
01:03:44,440 --> 01:03:47,240
That rocks.

1322
01:03:47,240 --> 01:03:50,800
I think I really don't do anything that's affecting my studies.

1323
01:03:50,800 --> 01:03:51,800
Yeah, one shot, one kill.

1324
01:03:51,800 --> 01:03:52,800
You read TV books, dude.

1325
01:03:52,800 --> 01:03:53,800
Yeah, that's true.

1326
01:03:53,800 --> 01:03:59,200
so what? You have a TV brain? No, you're crafting the perfect TV brain. I do have the perfect TV brain.

1327
01:03:59,200 --> 01:04:04,120
Yeah, you do. You remember every episode of every show and every actor. Yeah. But you

1328
01:04:04,120 --> 01:04:07,440
can't read a real book. It'd be funny if you open that that Brass Eye book and it's just

1329
01:04:07,440 --> 01:04:11,320
like, "I liked this episode. It was very funny. The jokes made me laugh."

1330
01:04:11,320 --> 01:04:16,600
Yeah. "Ha ha ha. I love this stuff. It makes me think, but also makes me laugh."

1331
01:04:16,600 --> 01:04:22,720
Makes me think about the fact that pedophilia is bad. Mm-hmm. I picked that

1332
01:04:22,720 --> 01:04:27,340
up because there's like a thing in that book that says like the guy that they

1333
01:04:27,340 --> 01:04:30,800
were sitting there like the guy he calls a two-pin din plug was like an

1334
01:04:30,800 --> 01:04:35,800
actual pedophile or something the story about the interaction between that you

1335
01:04:35,800 --> 01:04:43,560
want the backstage pass mm-hmm it all access pass to Brass eyes

1336
01:04:43,560 --> 01:04:50,060
