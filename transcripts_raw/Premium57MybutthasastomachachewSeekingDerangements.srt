[MUSIC]

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:17,660
>> Hot about list versus seeking derangements.

3
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:19,960
Let the fight begin.

4
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:29,960
[SOUND]

5
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:35,960
[SOUND]

6
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:38,000
>> Just me playing bass the whole time.

7
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:38,560
>> Yeah.

8
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:43,760
>> So you can't, you like, you respect these guys enough to not play bass during

9
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:48,200
the episode, but every single time we start recording, just us three,

10
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:50,040
you're playing the bass.

11
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:50,680
It's different.

12
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:53,720
You're like figuring out how to do like Katie Tut on bass.

13
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:55,120
>> You're having guests.

14
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:56,080
>> I just did that.

15
00:00:56,080 --> 00:00:58,240
>> You're trying to impress them, dude.

16
00:00:58,240 --> 00:00:59,760
>> Now, where are your houses now, bitch?

17
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:03,920
- Yeah, I don't need them being breastfed.

18
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:05,960
- I'm farting into the mic.

19
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:07,260
I'm pissing with the door open

20
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:10,300
and like turning up the mic so everyone can hear.

21
00:01:10,300 --> 00:01:12,320
- No respect.

22
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:13,840
- No respect calling your girlfriend toots.

23
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:16,400
- Did y'all hear about that school board member

24
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:19,080
that didn't realize her camera didn't pause

25
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:20,360
in her Zoom meeting?

26
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:23,000
So she put her laptop into the bathroom

27
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,080
and took a shit in front of the computer.

28
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:27,320
(laughing)

29
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:30,320
That rules, dude.

30
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:35,960
Have you seen the picture of it where it's just like the zoom call and it's just like the laptop like bathtub level?

31
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:37,960
Just...

32
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:39,960
Just shitting.

33
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:41,960
Is she still looking like into the camera?

34
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:43,960
I think so.

35
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:45,960
So apparently...

36
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:47,960
She thought she paused it.

37
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:49,960
This is how you get fired from your job, kids.

38
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:51,960
She was already...

39
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:53,960
People were trying to have her fired because she was a bigot.

40
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:55,960
[laughter]

41
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:57,960
So...

42
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:00,460
So they just use a big way.

43
00:02:00,460 --> 00:02:01,560
How do you know this?

44
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:03,760
What is there was a news article about it?

45
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:06,360
I read a news article for Jack goes to that school.

46
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:10,960
Keeps calling me fag in the hallways.

47
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:12,760
So tired of it.

48
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:13,960
I'm so tired.

49
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:17,060
Jacques has got Jacques gets fired from his teaching job

50
00:02:17,060 --> 00:02:18,760
because one of the students calls him.

51
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:19,160
Mr.

52
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:23,860
Gonsolin instead of Miss Gonsolin and he freaks out or MX

53
00:02:23,860 --> 00:02:25,760
Gonsolin someone gets console.

54
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:28,020
(laughing)

55
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:29,200
- Yeah, you have to say it with a Z.

56
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:31,080
- Did y'all see that new trans--

57
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:33,400
- Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

58
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:35,720
What did she do that was bigoted, Jacques?

59
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:37,520
- Well, I mean--

60
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:39,160
- She was like anti-gay.

61
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:40,960
- Yeah, I'm pretty sure she was against--

62
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:43,480
- No, but what did she do that was bigoted is what he asked.

63
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:44,320
- Did I?

64
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:46,560
(laughing)

65
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:49,400
- What was the wrong thing she did?

66
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:50,560
- Yeah.

67
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:52,280
- True, woke.

68
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:54,800
- Took a shit during the "It Gets Better" speech.

69
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:57,480
(laughing)

70
00:02:57,480 --> 00:03:00,000
- Yeah, she kept wheeling in a TV

71
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,420
and just playing Love, Simon

72
00:03:01,420 --> 00:03:02,920
and taking a shit at her desk.

73
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:04,240
(laughing)

74
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:06,640
- It was weird, it was a weird day at school.

75
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:09,080
- And that's fucked up, 'cause we got paid to do that.

76
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:11,320
(laughing)

77
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:13,160
- Whoops.

78
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:16,400
- Is that a pull-up bar behind you?

79
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:17,240
- No, that's a crazy--

80
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:19,080
- I'm so glad you asked.

81
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:19,920
Yes, it's a pull-up bar.

82
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:20,740
- Is that intentional?

83
00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:22,320
Do you leave it there so you can be like,

84
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:23,200
oh, I'm gonna--

85
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:25,720
I only put it up when I'm on video calls.

86
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:26,560
- You don't even have to pull it.

87
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:27,840
- Yeah, I've never used it.

88
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:30,080
Couldn't do a pull up to save my life.

89
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:31,840
- I use it every time I'm there.

90
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:34,280
- Pat tries to use it every time he's here.

91
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:35,680
- I do try to use it, yeah.

92
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:37,920
- Pull up, it's just a monkey, it's a single monkey bar.

93
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:41,040
- Right, it's fun to jump, like grab onto it and jump.

94
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:44,120
- Yeah, sometimes when I'm going from the living room.

95
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:46,160
Yeah, when I'm going from the living room to the kitchen,

96
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:48,760
I do think it's like a quarter of a second faster

97
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:50,200
to do a swing on the monkey bar.

98
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:51,040
(laughing)

99
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:52,640
- Yeah, to kind of vault yourself.

100
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:54,400
Just trying to do parkour.

101
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,640
Yeah.

102
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:58,800
And but but I have a very slippery tile floor, so I always eat shit.

103
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:01,940
Slam my knees into the sink.

104
00:04:01,940 --> 00:04:04,340
Break that precious egg head of yours.

105
00:04:04,340 --> 00:04:05,280
I don't have an egg.

106
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:09,280
Jock didn't know I was bald until like 10 minutes ago, which is so crazy.

107
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:12,840
I feel like I just recorded with you and you were bald then as well.

108
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:14,840
I've always I've been bald my whole life.

109
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:16,040
Oh, you've always been bald.

110
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:16,840
It's not true.

111
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:17,840
Potato head.

112
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:21,500
I shouldn't I shouldn't be ostracized for discriminating

113
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:28,940
hidden. I didn't. I love it. You're one of the **** talk.

114
00:04:28,940 --> 00:04:32,700
Take that hat off. Let's see.

115
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:38,820
You wanna call me an egghead? **** you, dude. I love you. You

116
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:41,700
guys both look good bald, you know. Yeah, I look better

117
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:44,660
bald. Yeah, like if I went bald, I would instantly age

118
00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:47,940
like like 20 years. I would look like a good thing. I've

119
00:04:47,940 --> 00:04:51,220
been on slowly aging 40 years plus. Wait, when did you go

120
00:04:51,220 --> 00:04:56,940
ball, Chuck. Um, very recently. Look at this. This is horrible. It's still it's going on.

121
00:04:56,940 --> 00:05:04,860
It's ongoing. It's on. You look like a private investigator. Yeah, the Christmas present

122
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:09,580
that keeps giving, of course, just somebody who needs to like, never be noticed. Like

123
00:05:09,580 --> 00:05:15,180
that's the hair exact hair. I believe the word you're looking for is Hanukkah. Yeah.

124
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:22,340
When I'm trying to not be noticed somewhere, I have this fake pair of glasses that I wear

125
00:05:22,340 --> 00:05:26,740
and then I wear a button up shirt and it's like I'm trying to get away with something.

126
00:05:26,740 --> 00:05:28,620
You just hold a newspaper in front of you.

127
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:29,620
I would bet my life.

128
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:30,620
A Chinese newspaper.

129
00:05:30,620 --> 00:05:31,620
Yacht newspaper.

130
00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:32,620
Yacht newspaper.

131
00:05:32,620 --> 00:05:35,620
Holds up a painting with the eyes cut out.

132
00:05:35,620 --> 00:05:38,980
Just standing in the middle of a crowd.

133
00:05:38,980 --> 00:05:41,380
No one's going to freaking notice me.

134
00:05:41,380 --> 00:05:42,860
No one's going to notice me.

135
00:05:42,860 --> 00:05:43,860
Well, it worked.

136
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:46,960
I mean, I was you would you if you didn't dress the way you do,

137
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:50,360
you would be very inconspicuous person, but you're wearing like

138
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:51,360
yellow.

139
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:51,660
Right.

140
00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:52,760
Maybe skirts.

141
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:55,760
Yeah, when Jacques says that they're wearing like glasses and

142
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:58,960
a button-up shirt, it's like a Hawaiian shirt and like 2010

143
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:00,260
New Year glasses.

144
00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:05,160
Under the radar right now.

145
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:07,860
Hey, I'm a spy.

146
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:08,460
Whatever.

147
00:06:08,460 --> 00:06:10,260
That's your normie camouflage.

148
00:06:10,260 --> 00:06:11,860
I love normie camouflage.

149
00:06:11,860 --> 00:06:16,740
It's like every once in a while I'll wear something on the way home from like working at a restaurant

150
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:22,920
All black like a black t-shirt and black pants and this guy's like you like fucking women, right?

151
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:32,060
When I was a I was a bus boy when I was like 15 and I was dating another bus boy

152
00:06:32,060 --> 00:06:40,460
It was really hot and we got off work one day we were both wearing like all black, you know, like busboys do and

153
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:44,840
Like a teens do we were looking for a place to like have sex

154
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:48,620
And this guy's back

155
00:06:48,620 --> 00:06:52,020
Strangers backyard a

156
00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:58,020
Backyard. Yeah, we were like hopping fences to get back. This is when Ben was dating by nada. Who's that?

157
00:06:58,020 --> 00:07:00,780
the murderer

158
00:07:00,780 --> 00:07:08,300
Joke about me, but I'm making a

159
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:28,300
I'm

160
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:43,300
the

161
00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:46,840
I was always told it was the devil growing up until I was like 15, maybe.

162
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:47,840
Whoa. In Maryland?

163
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:53,240
I hate you. I'm done talking to you.

164
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:56,700
In Jock's defense, he only knows four states.

165
00:07:56,700 --> 00:07:57,700
Okay.

166
00:07:57,700 --> 00:07:58,700
Hey, please.

167
00:07:58,700 --> 00:07:59,700
Maryland is the South.

168
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:00,700
Caleb, where'd you grow up again?

169
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:01,700
North Carolina.

170
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:02,700
Oh, that's why.

171
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:03,700
That part of Maryland, yeah.

172
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:04,700
That is why.

173
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:05,700
That's why they thought Pokemon was the devil.

174
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:11,700
That's why. That part of Maryland, yeah. That is why. That's why they thought Pokemon was the devil.

175
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:17,940
That makes sense. I know a lot of people. I mean, I knew kids whose parents like burned

176
00:08:17,940 --> 00:08:21,380
Harry Potter books in front of them. And in hindsight, it's like, oh, like they were...

177
00:08:21,380 --> 00:08:25,220
They were right. They were right. And they're doing it because they think like, you know,

178
00:08:25,220 --> 00:08:30,260
Harry Potter. That's anti-Turf shit. But it's like... Yeah, I mean, they were doing anti-Turf

179
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:35,900
book burnings. Whatever you want about, you know, like hard right.

180
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:37,780
That's why all those kids are evangelicals now.

181
00:08:37,780 --> 00:08:42,300
But like they were completely correct about several things,

182
00:08:42,300 --> 00:08:44,820
one of them being like Harry Potter being the devil, right?

183
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:48,580
Second, life begins at conception and three, all gays go to hell.

184
00:08:48,580 --> 00:08:51,460
I read about a lot of stuff.

185
00:08:51,460 --> 00:08:53,220
Michael Moore's a pussy.

186
00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:55,300
That's the four rules of a podcast.

187
00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:59,340
Yeah. Yeah.

188
00:08:59,340 --> 00:09:03,660
Yeah, no, so anyways, I was blowing my busboy co-worker in this guy's backyard.

189
00:09:03,660 --> 00:09:06,780
Wait, did you know the guy?

190
00:09:06,780 --> 00:09:07,420
No, no, no, no, no.

191
00:09:07,420 --> 00:09:09,500
Was it a barbecue situation?

192
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:13,660
No, it was empty. It was empty. This is like 11 o'clock at night. We didn't...

193
00:09:13,660 --> 00:09:14,140
Strangers backyard.

194
00:09:14,140 --> 00:09:18,140
Backyard, it's either barbecue, baseball, or blowjobs is the only...

195
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:22,300
I think how horny you are as like a 15-year-old, like, gay guy.

196
00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:25,500
No, I was a... oh, gay guy? Nah, never mind.

197
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:37,500
I

198
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:38,820
Almost beat the shit out of us.

199
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:41,100
We were like, no, no, no, we're not trying to rob you.

200
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:42,900
It was like, we were wearing all black.

201
00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:44,380
And we're like, we're not trying to break in.

202
00:09:44,380 --> 00:09:45,540
We're like, we're having sex.

203
00:09:45,540 --> 00:09:47,780
(laughing)

204
00:09:47,780 --> 00:09:51,460
Imagine like two cat burglars in your house.

205
00:09:51,460 --> 00:09:53,500
You wake up at 3 a.m. to a noise.

206
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:55,760
(laughing)

207
00:09:55,760 --> 00:10:01,580
- Like the little, like the black, like,

208
00:10:01,580 --> 00:10:03,740
knobby mask, shirt.

209
00:10:03,740 --> 00:10:05,780
- Just like fucking shoving.

210
00:10:05,780 --> 00:10:08,020
I have a ski mask on because it's sorry.

211
00:10:08,020 --> 00:10:08,860
(laughing)

212
00:10:08,860 --> 00:10:10,900
- Yeah, just two homos napping.

213
00:10:10,900 --> 00:10:11,740
- They're snapping tomorrow.

214
00:10:11,740 --> 00:10:12,580
(laughing)

215
00:10:12,580 --> 00:10:13,740
- It's out.

216
00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:16,820
- But yeah, that was one time,

217
00:10:16,820 --> 00:10:18,820
last time I almost got beat up.

218
00:10:18,820 --> 00:10:19,740
- That was the last time?

219
00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:20,780
- Who hasn't gotten beat up?

220
00:10:20,780 --> 00:10:22,820
- I mean like assaulted, assaulted.

221
00:10:22,820 --> 00:10:24,500
- I mean, who hasn't gotten beat up,

222
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:26,780
getting caught having public sex?

223
00:10:26,780 --> 00:10:27,620
I mean.

224
00:10:27,620 --> 00:10:28,660
- Not me.

225
00:10:28,660 --> 00:10:29,500
- These guys.

226
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:31,020
- Never ever.

227
00:10:31,020 --> 00:10:33,660
- You guys need to, come on, get it, pump it up.

228
00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:36,980
I had semi-public sex once and then the janitor walked in.

229
00:10:36,980 --> 00:10:37,820
That was it.

230
00:10:37,820 --> 00:10:39,740
(laughing)

231
00:10:39,740 --> 00:10:41,220
I had, I had.

232
00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:42,460
That was just at your house.

233
00:10:42,460 --> 00:10:43,460
It was at my dad's.

234
00:10:43,460 --> 00:10:44,620
My dad had it.

235
00:10:44,620 --> 00:10:45,780
(laughing)

236
00:10:45,780 --> 00:10:46,900
My dad's a janitor.

237
00:10:46,900 --> 00:10:48,660
(laughing)

238
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:51,460
I had sex with this person once

239
00:10:51,460 --> 00:10:54,760
in the laundry room behind their house.

240
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:58,820
And the next day, the neighbor went and told--

241
00:10:58,820 --> 00:11:00,740
The laundry room behind their house?

242
00:11:00,740 --> 00:11:01,860
I don't understand.

243
00:11:01,860 --> 00:11:03,020
It was like a laundry room.

244
00:11:03,020 --> 00:11:03,980
There was like a laundry room,

245
00:11:03,980 --> 00:11:05,960
like a separate room outside of the house

246
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:07,420
that was just the laundry room

247
00:11:07,420 --> 00:11:10,460
that they shared with the next door neighbor.

248
00:11:10,460 --> 00:11:14,020
And the next door neighbor walked in on me having sex

249
00:11:14,020 --> 00:11:15,780
with someone in there.

250
00:11:15,780 --> 00:11:18,820
And then the next day he went and told this person's husband

251
00:11:18,820 --> 00:11:22,900
that they caught us having sex.

252
00:11:22,900 --> 00:11:26,900
And I found out when I was leaving on the Greyhound

253
00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:29,220
and I opened my Banh Mi sandwich

254
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:32,100
and it was to my dismay and disgust.

255
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:35,100
course is a close to you fleeing on a greyhound is

256
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:40,380
the on a greyhound and I I open my sandwich and it's the wrong bond me it's

257
00:11:40,380 --> 00:11:45,060
tofu instead of pork and then I go and it is a sandwich and then I get about

258
00:11:45,060 --> 00:11:51,740
five or six calls and text messages being like what the fuck did you do and that

259
00:11:51,740 --> 00:11:56,180
was the worst moment of your whole life no it's great I mean sandwich is still

260
00:11:56,180 --> 00:12:00,500
good I mean that was I loved it I was basically living in Houston it's fine me

261
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:26,660
the

262
00:12:26,660 --> 00:12:30,860
Just one by me in the parking lot. It's like a very like inavigable city.

263
00:12:30,860 --> 00:12:35,780
It looks like you've made LA in The Sims and then

264
00:12:35,780 --> 00:12:40,460
uploaded like a mod that makes everyone fat. Yeah, it's literally if

265
00:12:40,460 --> 00:12:41,900
shock was an urban planner.

266
00:12:41,900 --> 00:12:44,640
(laughing)

267
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:47,860
- The restaurant's here, grocery's here, let's go.

268
00:12:47,860 --> 00:12:48,700
- Yeah.

269
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:51,100
(laughing)

270
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:53,500
- Yeah, everything else can be whatever.

271
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:55,880
- Just restaurant, grocery store alternating.

272
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:56,900
(laughing)

273
00:12:56,900 --> 00:12:58,300
For like 60 miles.

274
00:12:58,300 --> 00:12:59,300
(laughing)

275
00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:00,300
- Just a straight line.

276
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:02,620
(laughing)

277
00:13:02,620 --> 00:13:05,780
- One road alternating restaurant, grocery store.

278
00:13:05,780 --> 00:13:07,220
- Let's say you get your own city

279
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:08,860
to build from the ground up.

280
00:13:08,860 --> 00:13:09,700
- Yeah.

281
00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:13,140
world are you doing it? This is Jacques, Dubai. Okay, we're gonna

282
00:13:13,140 --> 00:13:17,900
we're gonna go God. Huh? Glasgow, Scotland. Why?

283
00:13:17,900 --> 00:13:21,740
Nowhere like it there. It's my favorite place. Have you bet

284
00:13:21,740 --> 00:13:24,740
your favorite place? Yeah, Scotland. Yes, I've been to

285
00:13:24,740 --> 00:13:29,620
Scotland. The country is crazy. I've been to I can't believe

286
00:13:29,620 --> 00:13:32,460
they would let you out and then into another country right out

287
00:13:32,460 --> 00:13:34,740
of that. I can't believe it. We're gonna drop back in.

288
00:13:36,780 --> 00:13:41,740
any border and then crossed it again is crazy. I'll give you a little preview of what's happened

289
00:13:41,740 --> 00:13:49,740
since then. They've taken my passport away and I was unable to travel or get a new passport

290
00:13:49,740 --> 00:14:02,300
for the last six, seven years. Why? What happened? So when I got arrested when I was 17 for five

291
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:04,580
felonies for industrial vandalism.

292
00:14:04,580 --> 00:14:06,900
Industrial vandalism?

293
00:14:06,900 --> 00:14:08,820
As you do, as you do.

294
00:14:08,820 --> 00:14:14,580
Explain industrial vandalism.

295
00:14:14,580 --> 00:14:15,900
Graffiti.

296
00:14:15,900 --> 00:14:18,300
Oh, oh, oh, Pooey.

297
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:22,860
Don't make it sound like a fuck is like what it was.

298
00:14:22,860 --> 00:14:24,700
I thought you were like a factory.

299
00:14:24,700 --> 00:14:25,500
Yes.

300
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:27,660
I thought you did like a killdozer thing.

301
00:14:27,660 --> 00:14:31,060
I was imagining like the beginning of the Minions movie, just like Jacques

302
00:14:31,060 --> 00:14:34,860
going all around every country and like, like burning Notre Dame and like,

303
00:14:34,860 --> 00:14:39,060
like doing like, like the Haiti earthquake somehow.

304
00:14:39,060 --> 00:14:40,060
Twin Towers.

305
00:14:40,060 --> 00:14:42,160
Taking Haiti.

306
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:45,560
So, okay, so.

307
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:48,260
Bass went too hard on that, on that DJ mix.

308
00:14:48,260 --> 00:14:51,060
Her point of print was never the same.

309
00:14:51,060 --> 00:14:53,760
Natural disasters for the last 10 years.

310
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:54,460
All of you.

311
00:14:54,460 --> 00:14:56,060
What did you do exactly?

312
00:14:56,060 --> 00:14:57,060
Mountain melons.

313
00:14:57,060 --> 00:14:58,360
You spray painted something.

314
00:14:58,360 --> 00:15:04,360
No, yeah, I spray painted a car dealership, a school property,

315
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:06,560
University of Louisiana property.

316
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:11,260
And I can't even remember like maybe like a stop sign,

317
00:15:11,260 --> 00:15:15,960
but the technicality was that it was on the business

318
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:18,860
and University of Lafayette's campus.

319
00:15:18,860 --> 00:15:24,060
So I got five felonies for industrial vandalism when they

320
00:15:24,060 --> 00:15:25,560
were doing the court proceeding.

321
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:26,960
I had no clue you were a felon.

322
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:28,960
and that's so cool.

323
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:29,460
Rock.

324
00:15:29,460 --> 00:15:35,760
When I was in jail for I was in jail for three and a half weeks.

325
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:36,660
What?

326
00:15:36,660 --> 00:15:44,460
17 like coming off of so many hallucinogens.

327
00:15:44,460 --> 00:15:46,060
I used to do hallucinogens.

328
00:15:46,060 --> 00:15:47,360
Oh, yeah, I read a story.

329
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:54,160
Yeah, I used to see I and like research chemicals research

330
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:57,160
chemical but also I was addicted to you're doing.

331
00:15:57,160 --> 00:16:03,160
I would drink 13 bottles a day in the high.

332
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:17,160
I'm going to tell you I'm being dead serious when I was at the height of

333
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:17,560
this.

334
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:20,960
I would go to how long was this period of you doing 13 bottles of

335
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:22,960
Awesome at least six months.

336
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:26,360
Wait, how many bottles is that total?

337
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:30,060
I'm sure I mean look, I think first jocks never going to die.

338
00:16:30,060 --> 00:16:33,860
I say this let me say that I've been trying for so long.

339
00:16:33,860 --> 00:16:35,260
I know I want that.

340
00:16:35,260 --> 00:16:38,760
This is what the this is a good vaccine is they've just killed

341
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:39,960
that much cough syrup.

342
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:42,760
I want that sweet escape by Gwen Stefani.

343
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:50,260
So anyway, I would do like whole boxes of mucinex also in her

344
00:16:50,260 --> 00:16:53,600
instead of doing, it's the equivalent.

345
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:55,620
And I would just go into a blackout.

346
00:16:55,620 --> 00:16:57,360
- Has the same amount of DXM.

347
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:59,880
- Yeah, and I would just like, I would do it,

348
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:01,480
and I would like, one time I took

349
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:05,600
like a box of Mucinex at a McDonald's.

350
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:09,120
And I had two cheeseburgers beforehand.

351
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:11,880
- You just eat the whole box, with the paper included.

352
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:13,000
- You've done that, Caleb.

353
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,040
I've seen you do it.

354
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:15,560
- I've done that, yeah.

355
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:16,400
- Whatever, listen.

356
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:17,720
- I'm eating cardboard, it's fine.

357
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:22,120
I get the 10 chicken McNuggets, two apple pies, a large Coke,

358
00:17:22,120 --> 00:17:23,800
and an ice cream.

359
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:28,360
And I eat all of that, and then I take my box of Mucinex DM,

360
00:17:28,360 --> 00:17:31,600
and then I just go crazy.

361
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:33,560
And I wake up in a blackout.

362
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:35,920
And this one day in particular, it's like winter,

363
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:36,880
and I'm running around--

364
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:39,560
I love the idea of waking up in a blackout.

365
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:41,640
I'm so blacked out right now.

366
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:44,800
So during this kind of like blacking out period,

367
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:47,240
I mean, I'm riding my bike so fast.

368
00:17:47,240 --> 00:18:08,240
lost

369
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:09,680
fuck is going on.

370
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:13,000
So obviously I don't trip anymore.

371
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,320
OK, wow.

372
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:16,600
Holy shit.

373
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:17,640
It sounds like that.

374
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:21,920
There's no way that could have ever been like awesome doing 13 bottles.

375
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:24,040
Now, have you guys done that shit before?

376
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:25,000
It's the worst.

377
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,120
No, I would.

378
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:28,840
I did it once and it was like I hated it.

379
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:32,160
I mean, I was probably like I had good times on acid and stuff,

380
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:34,160
but I would never even do acid again.

381
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:38,000
And when we did acid together, the only thing I hallucinated was a ceiling fan.

382
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:47,000
Like you hallucinated an entire new ceiling fan or the ceiling fan which is feeling weird.

383
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:51,400
I was laying down and I looked up and I guess there was like, I was like, can somebody shut

384
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:52,400
the fan off?

385
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:54,960
It's like the middle of lunch.

386
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:56,120
And there just was no fan.

387
00:18:56,120 --> 00:18:57,120
There's no fan.

388
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:58,120
That's kind of a scary.

389
00:18:58,120 --> 00:18:59,120
That's really creepy.

390
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:00,120
That's like a creepypasta.

391
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:01,120
The worst creepypasta ever.

392
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:03,320
(all laughing)

393
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:05,720
- The worst creepypasta ever.

394
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:06,800
Including at the beginning,

395
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:08,800
I took acid before this happened.

396
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:10,800
(all laughing)

397
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:12,800
- That's a Polish creepypasta right there.

398
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:14,800
(all laughing)

399
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:17,080
- Let me just round off this story really quickly.

400
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:18,320
- Okay, let's go.

401
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:21,440
- In court, I was being charged for this

402
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:26,040
and one of my friend's dads had spoken to the judge

403
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:30,480
before my proceeding and said that I was--

404
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:32,680
Sir, this is a retarded man.

405
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:35,080
He was like, "Kill him. Please don't kill him."

406
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:36,880
He was the opposite. He said, "This man..."

407
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:39,680
"He's the smartest man of all time."

408
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:42,280
He put him in jail.

409
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:45,680
No, no, no. He was like, "This guy is a danger. Don't let him..."

410
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:47,080
This man is a fucking genius.

411
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:52,480
"He's a flight risk. He's planning on moving to California to grow weed.

412
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:54,280
He's a drug dealer."

413
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:54,880
So...

414
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:55,480
Was he wrong?

415
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:56,880
They said flight risk?

416
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:57,680
Yeah, so...

417
00:19:57,680 --> 00:20:00,480
Okay, well, you absolutely were a flight risk.

418
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:02,120
Yeah, but you know, you should not.

419
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:04,680
You have to be sure to jump a greyhound risk like you.

420
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:09,160
Yeah, well, well, so possibly a boss risk.

421
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:12,920
Yeah. So the judge was like, and we're

422
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:15,000
a vote, we're taking back your passport.

423
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:18,240
Like they took my passport at that proceeding.

424
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:20,400
But anyway, you went to jail for 24 days.

425
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:22,560
What kind of fucking sentence is that?

426
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:26,800
Well, I went to jail for 24 days and then they sent me to a state

427
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:31,800
rehab next to the jail for three months.

428
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:34,080
- A state testing facility.

429
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:34,920
(laughing)

430
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:37,480
- During the day, they would bring us to group therapy

431
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:39,040
and then the other half of the day,

432
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:41,080
they would just bring us food from the jail

433
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:42,920
and they would be like, we don't know what to do.

434
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:46,080
So they'd either play a weird old VHS,

435
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:46,920
or they would put--

436
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:48,920
- A weird old VHS?

437
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:53,640
- Yes, or they would set up a karaoke machine.

438
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:55,860
And this is all people who have been sent directly

439
00:20:55,860 --> 00:20:57,460
from jail to the rehab.

440
00:20:57,460 --> 00:21:05,060
You join and there's literally karaoke for like Jeff sex

441
00:21:05,060 --> 00:21:05,560
and Joe.

442
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:10,860
No, is this how you gained your love of music was the karaoke

443
00:21:10,860 --> 00:21:11,660
and rehab?

444
00:21:11,660 --> 00:21:16,260
No, but I did learn how to sing power of love by Celine Dion.

445
00:21:16,260 --> 00:21:18,960
They had like four going to say Huey Lewis.

446
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:22,260
They had like more CDs.

447
00:21:22,260 --> 00:21:24,560
The VHS was back to the future.

448
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:26,820
(laughing)

449
00:21:26,820 --> 00:21:30,060
- And two of them were like early 2000s.

450
00:21:30,060 --> 00:21:32,860
- Back to the future, we thought it was a documentary.

451
00:21:32,860 --> 00:21:34,040
(laughing)

452
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:35,020
- It is a documentary.

453
00:21:35,020 --> 00:21:36,640
It's about how Doc Brown's trying to get into

454
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:38,860
Marty's pants the whole fucking time.

455
00:21:38,860 --> 00:21:39,700
- It's true.

456
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:40,540
- Old pussy doctor.

457
00:21:40,540 --> 00:21:41,380
Well, anyway.

458
00:21:41,380 --> 00:21:42,200
- Yeah.

459
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:43,040
(laughing)

460
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:45,780
- He had great hair, by the way, Doc Martin.

461
00:21:45,780 --> 00:21:46,620
- Oh yeah.

462
00:21:46,620 --> 00:21:48,900
- Imagine if he had that straightened out, like--

463
00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:49,740
- Is he still alive?

464
00:21:49,740 --> 00:21:50,660
- Like, three billion.

465
00:21:50,660 --> 00:21:51,500
- I think he's barely alive.

466
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:53,260
- I think he died.

467
00:21:53,260 --> 00:21:55,260
I think he died like two years ago.

468
00:21:55,260 --> 00:21:57,260
Christopher Lloyd's still alive.

469
00:21:57,260 --> 00:21:58,260
Oh.

470
00:21:58,260 --> 00:22:02,260
Yeah, he's in that new Bob Odenkirk movie. He's in the trailer.

471
00:22:02,260 --> 00:22:04,260
He plays Bob Odenkirk's dad.

472
00:22:04,260 --> 00:22:07,260
How is this motherfucker... He's only 82? Jesus Christ.

473
00:22:07,260 --> 00:22:12,260
He's one of those guys who's looked old forever.

474
00:22:12,260 --> 00:22:14,260
He was like John Huston or something.

475
00:22:14,260 --> 00:22:18,260
Yeah, I don't know how old he was on Taxi, but even on Taxi he looked fucking old.

476
00:22:18,260 --> 00:22:19,260
Holy shit.

477
00:22:19,260 --> 00:22:21,260
He came out of the womb looking like Larry David does today.

478
00:22:21,260 --> 00:22:24,260
It's all right. He literally looks like a month and then

479
00:22:24,260 --> 00:22:27,260
pussy like and he looks like exactly growing, growing,

480
00:22:27,260 --> 00:22:31,460
wisen than old. Well, he it was a it was a 30 year

481
00:22:31,460 --> 00:22:35,260
pregnancy term. Oh, he came out at 30. Can we talk about

482
00:22:35,260 --> 00:22:38,960
the great of all time? The greatest, what's the greatest

483
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:43,760
pregnancy? Um Junior, the movie Junior with Arnold

484
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:48,260
Schwarzenegger. Oh, man. Day to be done. Dream on. Where

485
00:22:48,260 --> 00:22:50,260
Danny was called Mr. Mom.

486
00:22:50,260 --> 00:22:52,260
No, no, no.

487
00:22:52,260 --> 00:22:54,260
Mr. Mom is the one.

488
00:22:54,260 --> 00:22:56,260
That's another transmate movie we haven't seen.

489
00:22:56,260 --> 00:22:58,260
Sorry.

490
00:22:58,260 --> 00:23:00,260
Why do you like that movie so much, Jacques?

491
00:23:00,260 --> 00:23:02,260
This is relatable.

492
00:23:02,260 --> 00:23:04,260
It's relatable.

493
00:23:04,260 --> 00:23:06,260
Who do you think you are?

494
00:23:06,260 --> 00:23:08,260
Arnold or Danny?

495
00:23:08,260 --> 00:23:10,260
He's the baby.

496
00:23:10,260 --> 00:23:12,260
The best scene in that whole movie

497
00:23:12,260 --> 00:23:14,260
is where Arnold goes to live

498
00:23:14,260 --> 00:23:16,260
among pregnant women at some kind of

499
00:23:16,260 --> 00:23:22,140
like halfway house for pregnant women and he's in full like drag straight

500
00:23:22,140 --> 00:23:27,740
disguise bullshit it's so funny does he fuck any of the women yeah he fucks

501
00:23:27,740 --> 00:23:36,940
Helen Hunt whoa wait he has sex as a pregnant man no what does that trigger

502
00:23:36,940 --> 00:23:45,020
you Patrick hmm I'm trying to figure out the logistics of it I do remember like

503
00:23:45,020 --> 00:23:47,500
There was so many in like 2009.

504
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:48,500
There was so many.

505
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:49,180
Shut up.

506
00:23:49,180 --> 00:23:50,900
How does that?

507
00:23:50,900 --> 00:23:52,540
Wait, no, no, try it.

508
00:23:52,540 --> 00:23:53,060
Yeah, go ahead.

509
00:23:53,060 --> 00:23:57,780
Well, it's a pregnant women's place, so they're both pregnant.

510
00:23:57,780 --> 00:23:59,300
So there's.

511
00:23:59,300 --> 00:24:01,140
Arnold, I don't know, I'm

512
00:24:01,140 --> 00:24:02,740
Arnold Scissorhands.

513
00:24:02,740 --> 00:24:06,060
Jail for what was the question you were going to ask?

514
00:24:06,060 --> 00:24:06,900
What do you know?

515
00:24:06,900 --> 00:24:08,660
I was I.

516
00:24:08,660 --> 00:24:11,180
So you say like two fat people can't.

517
00:24:11,180 --> 00:24:13,540
That's that's the thought that I had after.

518
00:24:13,540 --> 00:24:17,140
I didn't think that I thought maybe you thought that he didn't have a dick.

519
00:24:17,140 --> 00:24:21,100
No, no, I knew what he does.

520
00:24:21,100 --> 00:24:23,060
He's confused about the pussy thing.

521
00:24:23,060 --> 00:24:25,780
How does he get how does he get pregnant in that movie?

522
00:24:25,780 --> 00:24:27,180
It's somebody fuck his dickhole.

523
00:24:27,180 --> 00:24:28,300
His ass.

524
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:31,420
Yeah, it's sounding.

525
00:24:31,420 --> 00:24:33,900
Oh, no, no, no.

526
00:24:33,900 --> 00:24:37,460
It's her keeping super.

527
00:24:37,460 --> 00:24:40,780
The advancements of medical science and the super science

528
00:24:40,780 --> 00:24:44,780
and the advancements of medical science in this have

529
00:24:44,780 --> 00:24:48,780
super science. Super science. Okay, now I'm getting it.

530
00:24:48,780 --> 00:24:52,780
Say no more. That's it. The field of study known as super science.

531
00:24:52,780 --> 00:24:56,780
With a simple

532
00:24:56,780 --> 00:25:00,780
force known as black girl magic.

533
00:25:00,780 --> 00:25:04,780
They did black girl magic to Arnold and he became a pregnant

534
00:25:04,780 --> 00:25:08,780
man? It was science. Danny DeVito is a scientist.

535
00:25:08,780 --> 00:25:14,380
Why why did they pick a black woman doctor who did black girl magic to Arnold Schwarzenegger? Oh

536
00:25:14,380 --> 00:25:17,140
that's that's awesome and

537
00:25:17,140 --> 00:25:20,460
That's really awesome

538
00:25:20,460 --> 00:25:25,020
That's so cool, yeah, I

539
00:25:25,020 --> 00:25:32,900
Remember I was saying like I feel like 2009 there was like 15 books about like some

540
00:25:32,900 --> 00:25:35,260
news before like

541
00:25:35,260 --> 00:25:40,600
Anybody in my hometown knew what a trans person was and there was like 15 books by this guy

542
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:48,380
Who was like the pregnant man, and I feel like everybody was talking constantly about the pregnant man

543
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:53,420
It was like a work of fiction. No, it was a biography. It was like a

544
00:25:53,420 --> 00:25:56,700
trans guy who got pregnant and

545
00:25:56,700 --> 00:25:59,540
Just kept going on the Daily Show and being

546
00:26:00,180 --> 00:26:04,820
And it was like good morning America. Yeah. Oh, yeah the Oprah. I remember the Oprah episode

547
00:26:04,820 --> 00:26:07,220
He would just go on and be like, yeah be like

548
00:26:07,220 --> 00:26:09,740
surprised

549
00:26:09,740 --> 00:26:13,060
Yeah

550
00:26:13,060 --> 00:26:17,180
That is just

551
00:26:17,180 --> 00:26:20,060
Yeah

552
00:26:20,060 --> 00:26:24,140
Wasn't

553
00:26:24,140 --> 00:26:28,220
The whole country

554
00:26:28,220 --> 00:26:30,220
I bought the whole country with my Jamaican...

555
00:26:30,220 --> 00:26:32,220
You've had so many bottles thrown at your head out of moving cars.

556
00:26:32,220 --> 00:26:34,220
Literally!

557
00:26:34,220 --> 00:26:36,220
One time I was wearing skinny jeans in downtown Lafayette

558
00:26:36,220 --> 00:26:38,220
and this guy said

559
00:26:38,220 --> 00:26:40,220
"Hey, your jeans are too skinny, fag"

560
00:26:40,220 --> 00:26:42,220
and then I got hit in the back of the head

561
00:26:42,220 --> 00:26:44,220
with a glass bottle.

562
00:26:44,220 --> 00:26:46,220
Dude, I miss when skinny jeans were something that was gay.

563
00:26:46,220 --> 00:26:48,220
Yeah, you know.

564
00:26:48,220 --> 00:26:50,220
That was the best.

565
00:26:50,220 --> 00:26:52,220
Now it's like if you're gay, it's like really hot.

566
00:26:52,220 --> 00:26:54,220
If you're gay now, the biggest pants possible

567
00:26:54,220 --> 00:26:56,220
is what you're looking for.

568
00:26:56,220 --> 00:27:14,900
that

569
00:27:14,900 --> 00:27:32,900
and

570
00:27:32,900 --> 00:27:41,100
Okay, Ben, you wear all white like a professor like maybe like three times in the span of like two months and Jacques remembers me

571
00:27:41,100 --> 00:27:45,220

everything you post is like a drill

607
00:29:02,360 --> 00:29:03,540
going into a penis hole.

608
00:29:03,540 --> 00:29:04,580
Yeah, yeah.

609
00:29:04,580 --> 00:29:06,560
Yeah. No, literally, I was trying to

610
00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:08,520
scan through your Twitter page.

611
00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:09,940
I was like, why do I follow this guy?

612
00:29:09,940 --> 00:29:11,180
I was like, oh, it's Max.

613

Yeah, I have that.

614
00:29:14,580 --> 00:29:17,560
Yeah, I do make that impression on

615
00:29:17,560 --> 00:29:18,580
people.

616
00:29:18,580 --> 00:29:20,460
But yeah, who the hell is this person?

617
00:29:20,460 --> 00:29:21,460
A cock.

618
00:29:21,460 --> 00:29:23,700
(laughter)

619
00:29:23,700 --> 00:29:26,460
- My favorite one so far has been

620
00:29:26,460 --> 00:29:29,580
just the guy getting hit in the nuts with a mallet.

621
00:29:29,580 --> 00:29:30,420
- Oh yeah?

622
00:29:30,420 --> 00:29:32,780
- Yeah, that one's been, I've been getting a lot of miles.

623
00:29:32,780 --> 00:29:34,340
- You're the one who posted the guy

624
00:29:34,340 --> 00:29:35,900
shitting out a rubber baby?

625
00:29:35,900 --> 00:29:36,740
- Yep.

626
00:29:36,740 --> 00:29:37,560
- Yes.

627
00:29:37,560 --> 00:29:38,400
- Oh yeah, we saw it.

628
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:39,220
- That was a perfect one too.

629
00:29:39,220 --> 00:29:41,140
- Who's that guy that does the Pierce Paris?

630
00:29:41,140 --> 00:29:43,040
- Pierce Paris, yeah, the god.

631
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:43,880
- Mm-hmm.

632
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:45,740
- Yeah, literally king of Twitter.

633
00:29:45,740 --> 00:29:48,220
- Honestly, he's so creative.

634
00:29:48,220 --> 00:29:50,780
You said the one of the guy fucking the foreskin.

635
00:29:50,780 --> 00:29:54,060
Oh, oh, yes, yes.

636
00:29:54,060 --> 00:29:58,260
A guy put so much like saline in his foreskin that it's like this big.

637
00:29:58,260 --> 00:30:01,700
And his the tip of his foreskin is like a hole.

638
00:30:01,700 --> 00:30:03,700
And some guy fucks in it and then comes in.

639
00:30:03,700 --> 00:30:05,620
That's his actual that's I think he's on.

640
00:30:05,620 --> 00:30:06,860
I think he's cut.

641
00:30:06,860 --> 00:30:10,700
That's his actual dickhead that's gotten that. No, no, I don't believe.

642
00:30:10,700 --> 00:30:12,300
You got no answer.

643
00:30:12,300 --> 00:30:14,620
Nobody's fucking his urethra.

644
00:30:14,620 --> 00:30:16,980
Oh, I feel brother week right now.

645
00:30:16,980 --> 00:30:19,240
(laughing)

646
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:22,820
- And honestly, I feel like Westboro Baptist Church

647
00:30:22,820 --> 00:30:24,180
is like paying them to do that.

648
00:30:24,180 --> 00:30:25,020
- Yeah.

649
00:30:25,020 --> 00:30:25,840
(laughing)

650
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:26,680
- It's a gay style.

651
00:30:26,680 --> 00:30:28,460
- It's a gay style.

652
00:30:28,460 --> 00:30:30,500
That makes me like ashamed to be gay.

653
00:30:30,500 --> 00:30:31,340
- Yeah.

654
00:30:31,340 --> 00:30:33,060
- I can't even imagine how straight people

655
00:30:33,060 --> 00:30:33,940
must feel about this.

656
00:30:33,940 --> 00:30:35,420
If I was a straight person and I saw that,

657
00:30:35,420 --> 00:30:38,180
I'd be like, yes, we need to kill them all.

658
00:30:38,180 --> 00:30:41,300
- It's like the circus to me.

659
00:30:41,300 --> 00:30:42,140
- The gay people?

660
00:30:42,140 --> 00:30:43,220
- The gay people, yeah.

661
00:30:43,220 --> 00:30:44,460
(laughing)

662
00:30:44,460 --> 00:30:45,900
- We do be like that.

663
00:30:45,900 --> 00:30:47,900
Like an old timey traveling circus.

664
00:30:47,900 --> 00:30:49,400
Exactly like a freak show.

665
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:55,900
You put a nickel in a pot and then you get to poke someone with a bamboo stick.

666
00:30:55,900 --> 00:30:58,400
This man fucks other men in their ass!

667
00:30:58,400 --> 00:31:01,900
Be amazed!

668
00:31:01,900 --> 00:31:04,900
And I'm like, wow, that's some funny ass shit, dude.

669
00:31:04,900 --> 00:31:08,900
The crowd gets to guess how many times he's been fucked in the ass.

670
00:31:08,900 --> 00:31:11,900
I don't know, one, maybe two times?

671
00:31:11,900 --> 00:31:13,900
That's basically a punishment to me.

672
00:31:13,900 --> 00:31:15,740
Oh, God bless your soul.

673
00:31:15,740 --> 00:31:21,600
We should do I mean, that's basically what we do is rock.

674
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:26,940
But oh, yeah, I just like a less side show spectacle for you,

675
00:31:26,940 --> 00:31:29,940
faggots like a circus freak appeal, but that's also so much shit on.

676
00:31:29,940 --> 00:31:32,180
I mean, that's just what Tick-Tock is.

677
00:31:32,180 --> 00:31:33,340
Oh yeah, no, totally.

678
00:31:33,340 --> 00:31:35,600
I made like a talk is just like a modern day.

679
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:38,400
No, I made five Tick-Tock circus freak show.

680
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:40,680
Jock has a tick tock. Oh, fuck.

681
00:31:40,680 --> 00:31:43,040
All I do is dance on it.

682
00:31:43,040 --> 00:31:45,280
Jacques Tintouk is next level.

683
00:31:45,280 --> 00:31:46,480
I haven't seen it.

684
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:48,400
Sincerely, yeah, next level.

685
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:51,520
I have videos of instructions on how to float.

686
00:31:51,520 --> 00:31:55,440
Oh, like your rafts?

687
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:57,440
Yeah, down the river on an air mattress.

688
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:58,400
How to levitate.

689
00:31:58,400 --> 00:32:00,800
[laughter]

690
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:02,080
Even though I just fled Montana.

691
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:04,560
Listen up, y'all. This is how you freaking levitate.

692
00:32:04,560 --> 00:32:09,680
I'm trying to find out when exactly the weather is going to be good enough for me to go back

693
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:10,480
just to float.

694
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:11,920
There's a flu season.

695
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:14,640
- Yeah. - In Louisiana?

696
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:16,720
- No, in... - Oh, in Missoula, Montana.

697
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:19,360
Yeah, I'm gonna go back to Missoula for like a week

698
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:21,080
during whenever it's warm enough.

699
00:32:21,080 --> 00:32:23,080
I mean, even if it's like... - Why don't you just float there?

700
00:32:23,080 --> 00:32:25,520
- Hmm. - There's a river everywhere.

701
00:32:25,520 --> 00:32:30,520
- His face, Jacques's face. (laughing)

702
00:32:30,520 --> 00:32:33,800
- You literally considered it.

703
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:35,840
- What? - I didn't consider nothing.

704
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:37,800
That was just one of my many strokes.

705
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:40,840
- I can tell with your like,

706
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:43,380
go back to Missoula and on the flight back, I'll get groped by

707
00:32:43,380 --> 00:32:45,700
the same flight attendant that did it last time. It's like a

708
00:32:45,700 --> 00:32:50,680
curb your enthusiasm episode gone wrong. Yeah. I mean, that's

709
00:32:50,680 --> 00:32:55,220
just your entire life honestly. Is it a a gentile curb your

710
00:32:55,220 --> 00:32:59,560
curb your enthusiasm. Gone wrong. Gone very. I mean, of

711
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:02,900
course, it can't go right if it's just a gentile, you know.

712
00:33:02,900 --> 00:33:05,860
I think my life is more adjacent to the golden girls or

713
00:33:05,860 --> 00:33:18,300
the

714
00:33:18,300 --> 00:33:20,540
I'm every and any woman.

715
00:33:20,540 --> 00:33:25,340
What's that little cum dribble on your shirt there, Caleb say?

716
00:33:25,340 --> 00:33:28,300
This is a Monty Python shirt.

717
00:33:28,300 --> 00:33:30,620
Oh, OK. Pretty fucking cool, huh?

718
00:33:30,620 --> 00:33:32,420
I couldn't read that little sploosh.

719
00:33:32,420 --> 00:33:33,940
It doesn't look like cum.

720
00:33:33,940 --> 00:33:35,380
Now it looks like it does.

721
00:33:35,380 --> 00:33:36,180
It does now.

722
00:33:36,180 --> 00:33:40,300
Now that Caleb wears that shirt, Caleb wears that shirt around in public.

723
00:33:40,300 --> 00:33:41,900
I do. I think it's funny.

724
00:33:41,900 --> 00:33:44,780
Yeah, he just cocks his eyebrow and goes like, it's ironic.

725
00:33:44,780 --> 00:33:45,380
Hello.

726
00:33:47,620 --> 00:33:49,620
Oh, do you want to say a quote about...

727
00:33:49,620 --> 00:33:51,620
Good morning America, like the pregnant man.

728
00:33:51,620 --> 00:33:55,620
Oh, so you have anything to say about my shirt?

729
00:33:55,620 --> 00:33:58,620
Yeah, he waits until someone comes up to him,

730
00:33:58,620 --> 00:34:00,620
like some nerd comes up to him and goes like,

731
00:34:00,620 --> 00:34:02,620
"Oh dude, the knights who say 'knee'"

732
00:34:02,620 --> 00:34:04,620
and Caleb just goes, "I don't know what that is."

733
00:34:04,620 --> 00:34:10,620
That's what being cool is, dude.

734
00:34:10,620 --> 00:34:12,620
Yeah.

735
00:34:12,620 --> 00:34:14,620
John Cleese was the original crazy-ass white boy.

736
00:34:14,620 --> 00:34:15,620
He was.

737
00:34:15,620 --> 00:34:16,620
That's some real shit.

738
00:34:16,620 --> 00:34:18,620
There's a crazy discourse.

739
00:34:18,620 --> 00:34:20,780
I know that was that that they blew up.

740
00:34:20,780 --> 00:34:22,940
He tried to return to inherit.

741
00:34:22,940 --> 00:34:24,220
That's a crazy white boy.

742
00:34:24,220 --> 00:34:24,420
Right.

743
00:34:24,420 --> 00:34:25,300
He's tricky.

744
00:34:25,300 --> 00:34:26,860
Hey, that is pretty crazy.

745
00:34:26,860 --> 00:34:27,540
Damn.

746
00:34:27,540 --> 00:34:33,300
If I had a fee shopping shit, if I had been that that cashier, I would have been so I

747
00:34:33,300 --> 00:34:35,380
would have been so funny.

748
00:34:35,380 --> 00:34:35,980
Who's the crazy?

749
00:34:35,980 --> 00:34:37,580
Imagine if you had been works chat.

750
00:34:37,580 --> 00:34:40,460
Can't I can't be binary.

751
00:34:40,460 --> 00:34:40,860
It can't be.

752
00:34:40,860 --> 00:34:43,420
No, can't be max because he's actually not white.

753
00:34:43,420 --> 00:34:45,660
His defense down.

754
00:34:45,940 --> 00:34:48,860
I would say I'm the original crazy ass white boy.

755
00:34:48,860 --> 00:34:53,220
I think Caleb has the most calls from the government.

756
00:34:53,220 --> 00:34:56,740
Me and Jacques might be like this, honestly.

757
00:34:56,740 --> 00:34:57,740
Yeah.

758
00:34:57,740 --> 00:34:58,740
Wow.

759
00:34:58,740 --> 00:35:04,660
I feel like all non-white people would see you, Caleb, and then just see you as the little

760
00:35:04,660 --> 00:35:08,780
bully in the Toy Story movie franchise.

761
00:35:08,780 --> 00:35:09,780
Sid.

762
00:35:09,780 --> 00:35:16,020
I get compared to Sid by, you know, most, a lot of people, mailmen and waitresses.

763
00:35:16,020 --> 00:35:18,620
My mother, my daddy.

764
00:35:18,620 --> 00:35:19,620
Everybody kind of thinks I'm Sid.

765
00:35:19,620 --> 00:35:23,620
It's either Sid or the guy from American History X, so I think you should be.

766
00:35:23,620 --> 00:35:28,020
Or just like, or like, people be like, "Where do I know you from?"

767
00:35:28,020 --> 00:35:33,340
"Oh, you look like a baby I saw yesterday.

768
00:35:33,340 --> 00:35:34,340
Are you that baby?"

769
00:35:34,340 --> 00:35:37,260
And I just have to be like, "No, I'm a man."

770
00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:39,700
- I will say, before I shave my head,

771
00:35:39,700 --> 00:35:41,540
I wouldn't get carded for alcohol.

772
00:35:41,540 --> 00:35:42,960
And then after I shave my head,

773
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:45,420
I get carded every single time.

774
00:35:45,420 --> 00:35:48,900
And I feel like it's like, do you honestly think

775
00:35:48,900 --> 00:35:49,780
that I'm like a bait?

776
00:35:49,780 --> 00:35:51,500
I'm like a little kid now?

777
00:35:51,500 --> 00:35:52,620
That I don't have any hair?

778
00:35:52,620 --> 00:35:54,020
- Yeah, when they card me at the liquor store--

779
00:35:54,020 --> 00:35:55,860
- You're like a make a wish patient.

780
00:35:55,860 --> 00:35:56,700
- Yeah.

781
00:35:56,700 --> 00:35:58,820
- When they card me at the liquor store--

782
00:35:58,820 --> 00:36:00,540
- You gotta, this is my one wish.

783
00:36:00,540 --> 00:36:01,580
(laughing)

784
00:36:01,580 --> 00:36:05,420
I'm buying two Modellos, 'cause I can't afford a six pack.

785
00:36:05,420 --> 00:36:07,020
- Yeah, every time I go to the liquor store

786
00:36:07,020 --> 00:36:08,340
and I'm trying to buy something,

787
00:36:08,340 --> 00:36:10,460
I'm like, my ID's expired or something,

788
00:36:10,460 --> 00:36:11,300
and they're like,

789
00:36:11,300 --> 00:36:15,300
you look like an old, fat baby that's 50 years old,

790
00:36:15,300 --> 00:36:16,640
but we're gonna give you liquor.

791
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:18,820
- That's what they say. - That's so rude.

792
00:36:18,820 --> 00:36:19,660
- You need to go to a new liquor store.

793
00:36:19,660 --> 00:36:21,980
- You got a lot of sloppy bitches.

794
00:36:21,980 --> 00:36:25,620
- Are you going to like the Dick's Resort liquor store?

795
00:36:25,620 --> 00:36:29,080
- Hi, welcome to Margaritaville, what can we get you?

796
00:36:29,080 --> 00:36:32,300
- You go to Margaritaville every day?

797
00:36:32,300 --> 00:36:33,580
(laughing)

798
00:36:33,580 --> 00:36:34,420
- Who wouldn't?

799
00:36:34,420 --> 00:36:35,460
- Exactly.

800
00:36:35,460 --> 00:36:36,900
- What do you do for the drinks, dude?

801
00:36:36,900 --> 00:36:40,800
but is it an actual place margarita bill

802
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:43,540

- Wow, Jimmy only, I don't know.

810
00:37:03,900 --> 00:37:04,740
- Were you preparing for something?

811
00:37:04,740 --> 00:37:05,740
- You were fucking an older woman or something?

812
00:37:05,740 --> 00:37:07,220
(laughing)

813
00:37:07,220 --> 00:37:10,100
- I just got really into Cheeseburger in Paradise

814
00:37:10,100 --> 00:37:12,300
and then that one song where he talks about,

815
00:37:12,300 --> 00:37:13,880
he like tries to be serious.

816
00:37:13,880 --> 00:37:15,860
You know that one?

817
00:37:15,860 --> 00:37:16,700
(laughing)

818
00:37:16,700 --> 00:37:17,520
No?

819
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:19,300
He talks about like a, there's a song that he wrote

820
00:37:19,300 --> 00:37:20,900
that's like about-- - Oh, the one about a veteran?

821
00:37:20,900 --> 00:37:23,900
- Yeah, it's like about a World War II veteran

822
00:37:23,900 --> 00:37:25,980
that he like knows in Florida.

823
00:37:25,980 --> 00:37:28,740
And he like sings a song about that guy's life

824
00:37:28,740 --> 00:37:30,620
and the guy's whole life is like,

825
00:37:30,620 --> 00:37:34,040
he uh... he fuckin like loses i in the war

826
00:37:34,040 --> 00:37:39,200
his wife dies to bombs and veterans are kind of a kind of like for scum

827
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:42,760
yeah but they said it's a way more tragic it's it's a horrible life his

828
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:46,260
whole family dies in like he loses his eyes and some shit

829
00:37:46,260 --> 00:37:49,640
and at the end he's just like a classic king it like a florida bar

830
00:37:49,640 --> 00:37:50,680
and he's like

831
00:37:50,680 --> 00:37:53,640
spree alright honestly is pretty cool life

832
00:37:53,640 --> 00:37:55,400
that's what's happening

833
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:59,480
did you be both of the guys like it is honestly i'm not going to sit here in

834
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:00,840
Florida and drink with Jimmy.

835
00:38:00,840 --> 00:38:02,640
You just roll with the punches.

836
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:03,760
Yeah, yeah.

837
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:09,080
Look, Jimmy's big lesson here was that all veterans are complainers and alcoholics.

838
00:38:09,080 --> 00:38:10,080
It's true.

839
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:11,840
[LAUGHTER]

840
00:38:11,840 --> 00:38:12,680
And anti-inferiority.

841
00:38:12,680 --> 00:38:14,160
These people still matter, honestly.

842
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:15,160
Jimmy Buffett.

843
00:38:15,160 --> 00:38:16,000
Yeah.

844
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:17,040
He rules, dude.

845
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:21,000
How do they put the veterans on an island away from us?

846
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:22,400
I think that's Hawaii.

847
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:22,900
Yeah.

848
00:38:22,900 --> 00:38:24,120
[LAUGHTER]

849
00:38:24,120 --> 00:38:26,280
That's already a place.

850
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:27,680
Like, Guantanamo.

851
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:28,240
I feel like a lot--

852
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:30,280
I guess they're not really veterans if they're there, though.

853
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:35,520
If I met if I met the guy from one by Metallica, I would tell him to grow up.

854
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:39,400
Tell me, stop complaining.

855
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:41,720
You know what he needs to do is just move to Florida.

856
00:38:41,720 --> 00:38:43,200
Darkness and prisoning me.

857
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:44,760
Dude, you sound like a teenager.

858
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:46,640
Grow the fuck up. You're an adult.

859
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:48,400
Come on. I'm from hurt by Johnny Cash.

860
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:50,360
He's to go to therapy.

861
00:38:50,360 --> 00:38:52,800
That baby from the Nevada.

862
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:56,120
Stop expecting your your listeners to do the emotional labor

863
00:38:56,840 --> 00:38:58,340
Processing your trauma.

864
00:38:58,340 --> 00:39:03,640
Hey that baby from Nirvana from the Nevermind album is the CEO

865
00:39:03,640 --> 00:39:04,740
of Goldman Sachs.

866
00:39:04,740 --> 00:39:06,240
Now, do you feel old yet?

867
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:10,140
If you were that baby, is that a meme?

868
00:39:10,140 --> 00:39:12,340
That kid's in the I just made that up.

869
00:39:12,340 --> 00:39:18,540
I just turn that into a meme shot could be funny.

870
00:39:18,540 --> 00:39:23,640
Do you think that Nirvana baby if that happened if you were that

871
00:39:23,640 --> 00:39:27,220
Baby, would you be pissed that your wiener was just always like

872
00:39:27,220 --> 00:39:30,020
God, I'm going to be like the most famous wiener in the world.

873
00:39:30,020 --> 00:39:32,860
I'm not going to be proud forever.

874
00:39:32,860 --> 00:39:34,060
Yeah. In certain circles.

875
00:39:34,060 --> 00:39:36,360
Yeah. In certain islands in the Caribbean.

876
00:39:36,360 --> 00:39:40,820
Big fans of that one album of Nirvana.

877
00:39:40,820 --> 00:39:42,900
And I never listened to it, but I love it.

878
00:39:42,900 --> 00:39:44,160
I love it. No, no, no.

879
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:44,740
You don't understand.

880
00:39:44,740 --> 00:39:46,700
I like the cover because of the dollar on it.

881
00:39:46,700 --> 00:39:49,080
OK, yeah, I like the money.

882
00:39:49,080 --> 00:39:52,420
OK, we're back on the trips now.

883
00:39:52,420 --> 00:40:07,420
I

884
00:40:07,420 --> 00:40:10,420
Which is like a dating app for girls.

885
00:40:10,420 --> 00:40:12,020
I didn't know either, Caleb.

886
00:40:12,020 --> 00:40:16,420
It's like a VIP dating app where you have to like apply to get into it,

887
00:40:16,420 --> 00:40:19,420
but there's a Jewish one that you apply to get into.

888
00:40:19,420 --> 00:40:21,320
But it's a total ripoff because there's only,

889
00:40:21,320 --> 00:40:24,620
there's probably only like 20 people on it. Maybe only 20 gay guys.

890
00:40:24,620 --> 00:40:27,220
Yeah, there's like 11 people and they're all really annoying.

891
00:40:27,220 --> 00:40:32,420
Like they've all been banned from like Tinder for like calling everyone they've met.

892
00:40:32,420 --> 00:40:35,420
Which gay Jews on a dating app are annoying?

893
00:40:35,420 --> 00:40:37,420
Oh my god, no way.

894
00:40:37,420 --> 00:40:40,420
The thing is, they're not even actually rich.

895
00:40:40,420 --> 00:40:43,420
It's just like a kind of like aspirant class of like young person who...

896
00:40:43,420 --> 00:40:45,420
It's just influencers?

897
00:40:45,420 --> 00:40:47,420
It's the Jewish interns.

898
00:40:47,420 --> 00:40:49,420
Not even. It's like people who are like,

899
00:40:49,420 --> 00:40:52,420
"I'm a young budding CEO in the making."

900
00:40:52,420 --> 00:40:56,420
It's like that, which is horrible when you encounter one of those people.

901
00:40:56,420 --> 00:40:58,420
But then if they're gay and then also Jewish on top of that.

902
00:40:58,420 --> 00:41:00,420
It's like a gay entre...

903
00:41:00,420 --> 00:41:03,420
Are you saying the worst person is a gay entrepreneur?

904
00:41:03,420 --> 00:41:07,100
Yeah, but yeah, no locks love is a scam.

905
00:41:07,100 --> 00:41:10,560
They they charge you money.

906
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:11,760
You don't even get a part of it.

907
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:13,300
And they don't even get it.

908
00:41:13,300 --> 00:41:14,340
They don't even mail you.

909
00:41:14,340 --> 00:41:16,040
They don't even mail you locks.

910
00:41:16,040 --> 00:41:19,600
I thought it was like I thought it was like a loot crate.

911
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:23,440
Yeah, I thought they were going to send me smoked salmon every month.

912
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:25,440
I got to fuck a guy. What the hell?

913
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:30,320
This son of a bitch making me talk to gay entrepreneurs.

914
00:41:30,320 --> 00:41:32,880
Oh, I have sex with them.

915
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:34,880
Now I'm investing in his business?

916
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:36,880
I thought I was getting fucking salmon!

917
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:38,880
What the fuck is this?

918
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:40,880
But they didn't let my black friend on.

919
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:42,880
So we're gonna cancel.

920
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:44,880
Wait, do you have to confirm that you're Jewish to get on?

921
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:46,880
Send them a picture of your cock.

922
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:48,880
Yeah, just a circumcision scar picture.

923
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:50,880
I didn't.

924
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:52,880
I said, I told them I was a philanthropist.

925
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:54,880
And they were like, close enough?

926
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:56,880
Yeah.

927
00:41:56,880 --> 00:41:58,880
Yeah, just like philanthropist and small business owner.

928
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:00,880
I live on the Lower East Side.

929
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:02,880
on the lower east side.

930
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:05,300
- That coat is Jewish.

931
00:42:05,300 --> 00:42:08,520
- I don't know. - COVID.

932
00:42:08,520 --> 00:42:09,680
- They didn't let my black friend on,

933
00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:11,680
so like I said, we're going to cancel them.

934
00:42:11,680 --> 00:42:12,940
It's really messed up.

935
00:42:12,940 --> 00:42:14,520
He had his feelings hurt,

936
00:42:14,520 --> 00:42:16,160
and now I'm gonna do like a kind of like

937
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:17,520
stand and deliver thing.

938
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:19,280
- Can you believe they let Dan Allegretto on,

939
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:20,120
but not like your black friend?

940
00:42:20,120 --> 00:42:23,660
- It's like public, what is it, his attorney or whatever,

941
00:42:23,660 --> 00:42:25,780
make my case with my black client.

942
00:42:25,780 --> 00:42:27,360
- You're gonna protect him?

943
00:42:27,360 --> 00:42:28,500
- I'm gonna protect him. - From Lost Club?

944
00:42:28,500 --> 00:42:32,220

you see them and like

947
00:42:38,900 --> 00:42:43,220
the result is that they'll they let him on but he has to have a little mark on

948
00:42:43,220 --> 00:42:48,780
his profile that's like we were forced to have a look at it

949
00:42:48,780 --> 00:42:52,220

958
00:43:22,820 --> 00:43:24,980
it's to have a funny poop

959
00:43:24,980 --> 00:43:26,540
That does scare me though.

960
00:43:26,540 --> 00:43:27,380
They're good.

961
00:43:27,380 --> 00:43:28,740
They scare me every time.

962
00:43:28,740 --> 00:43:30,380
I mean, every time.

963
00:43:30,380 --> 00:43:32,940
I've seen his drug shit split anyway,

964
00:43:32,940 --> 00:43:34,860
so it's not like a big deal.

965
00:43:34,860 --> 00:43:38,500
I did have years for shitting blood and throwing up blood.

966
00:43:38,500 --> 00:43:41,380
I also had a shitting blood period in my life.

967
00:43:41,380 --> 00:43:42,740
Never went to the doctor for it,

968
00:43:42,740 --> 00:43:43,820
just completely ignored it.

969
00:43:43,820 --> 00:43:45,700
Oh, oh my God, really?

970
00:43:45,700 --> 00:43:46,540
(laughing)

971
00:43:46,540 --> 00:43:47,380
Yeah.

972
00:43:47,380 --> 00:43:49,060
I think it was the shitting blood period.

973
00:43:49,060 --> 00:43:51,300
(laughing)

974
00:43:51,300 --> 00:43:53,140
The shitting blood was not so bad.

975
00:43:53,140 --> 00:43:53,980
Caleb's a pregnant man.

976
00:43:53,980 --> 00:43:55,980
I'm not the pregnant man. I'm not gay.

977
00:43:55,980 --> 00:43:58,980
I'm not a baby. I'm not Sid from Toy Story.

978
00:43:58,980 --> 00:44:01,980
I didn't have a bumba clot. Nobody knows what that is, Max.

979
00:44:01,980 --> 00:44:04,980
Is that some Spanish thing, you fucking loser?

980
00:44:04,980 --> 00:44:05,980
Yeah, it is.

981
00:44:05,980 --> 00:44:06,980
Shut up.

982
00:44:06,980 --> 00:44:08,980
It's worrisome when you're spitting blood.

983
00:44:08,980 --> 00:44:11,980
It's only when you're pissing blood or you're throwing up.

984
00:44:11,980 --> 00:44:12,980
That's not true.

985
00:44:12,980 --> 00:44:15,980
What if you're just bleeding from somewhere on your body?

986
00:44:15,980 --> 00:44:17,980
Is that okay?

987
00:44:17,980 --> 00:44:19,980
You can smell it before you...

988
00:44:19,980 --> 00:44:21,980
You're gonna get a cut. You're human.

989
00:44:21,980 --> 00:44:23,980
These bodies aren't hard.

990
00:44:23,980 --> 00:44:25,980
I keep eating needles and broken glass.

991
00:44:25,980 --> 00:44:27,980
We're not made of bugs.

992
00:44:27,980 --> 00:44:29,980
It's kind of fucked up.

993
00:44:29,980 --> 00:44:31,980
I really like the taste of them.

994
00:44:31,980 --> 00:44:33,980
You both just had ulcers then, right?

995
00:44:33,980 --> 00:44:35,980
I think that I had a...

996
00:44:35,980 --> 00:44:39,980
What's it called when you have a thingy on your butthole?

997
00:44:39,980 --> 00:44:41,980
A hemorrhoid?

998
00:44:41,980 --> 00:44:43,980
I think I had a hemorrhoid.

999
00:44:43,980 --> 00:44:45,980
Sometimes I would touch it and it felt so bad but a little good.

1000
00:44:45,980 --> 00:44:47,980
Oh my God!

1001
00:44:47,980 --> 00:44:49,980
I think you're going to talk about touching your hemorrhoid.

1002
00:44:49,980 --> 00:44:50,980
What?

1003
00:44:50,980 --> 00:44:51,980
That's okay.

1004
00:44:51,980 --> 00:44:52,980
I mean, we've covered hemorrhoids.

1005
00:44:52,980 --> 00:44:53,980
It's a bigger...

1006
00:44:53,980 --> 00:44:54,980
Hemorrhoids like a male clit.

1007
00:44:54,980 --> 00:44:55,980
I had to have...

1008
00:44:55,980 --> 00:44:56,980
Like super sensitive red spot.

1009
00:44:56,980 --> 00:44:57,980
You just like touch it and rub it a little bit.

1010
00:44:57,980 --> 00:44:58,980
That is the male G-spot.

1011
00:44:58,980 --> 00:44:59,980
Yeah.

1012
00:44:59,980 --> 00:45:00,980
You rub it a little bit like the fucking dot on an old laptop.

1013
00:45:00,980 --> 00:45:01,980
You have to do the come Heather motion on the hemorrhoid and then you come.

1014
00:45:01,980 --> 00:45:02,980
Exactly, yeah.

1015
00:45:02,980 --> 00:45:03,980
I was just sitting in the bathroom fucking shoving, doing the alphabet with my finger

1016
00:45:03,980 --> 00:45:04,980
on my asshole.

1017
00:45:04,980 --> 00:45:05,980
Spelling hemorrhoid.

1018
00:45:05,980 --> 00:45:06,980
Yeah.

1019
00:45:06,980 --> 00:45:07,980
And just feeling it.

1020
00:45:07,980 --> 00:45:08,980
And I was like, "Oh, I'm gonna have to do that."

1021
00:45:08,980 --> 00:45:09,980
And then I was like, "Oh, I'm gonna have to do that."

1022
00:45:09,980 --> 00:45:15,500
Exactly, yeah. I was just sitting in the bathroom fucking shoving, doing the alphabet with my

1023
00:45:15,500 --> 00:45:17,700
finger on my asshole.

1024
00:45:17,700 --> 00:45:18,700
Spelling hemorrhoid.

1025
00:45:18,700 --> 00:45:20,420
Yeah, and just feeling amazing.

1026
00:45:20,420 --> 00:45:27,900
Free tip to any homosexual listeners to Potrat List, do that on your bottom next time and

1027
00:45:27,900 --> 00:45:28,900
they'll not immediately.

1028
00:45:28,900 --> 00:45:30,900
First, you got to give them a hemorrhoid.

1029
00:45:30,900 --> 00:45:34,580
First, you got to give them hemorrhoids. Ask them to sit in the bathroom on the toilet

1030
00:45:34,580 --> 00:45:35,580
for like 20 minutes.

1031
00:45:35,580 --> 00:45:36,580
How do you even get one of them?

1032
00:45:36,580 --> 00:45:39,060
You get hemorrhoids from sitting too long on the toilet.

1033
00:45:39,060 --> 00:45:41,060
Yeah, which I used to love to do.

1034
00:45:41,060 --> 00:45:41,900
Oh, I did that too.

1035
00:45:41,900 --> 00:45:43,220
Yeah, I definitely.

1036
00:45:43,220 --> 00:45:45,300
Honestly, that is so gay.

1037
00:45:45,300 --> 00:45:48,980
I would go to the bathroom to jack off,

1038
00:45:48,980 --> 00:45:51,060
but for some reason I would like sit on the toilet

1039
00:45:51,060 --> 00:45:52,420
like I was taking a shit just in case

1040
00:45:52,420 --> 00:45:54,180
somebody walked into the bathroom.

1041
00:45:54,180 --> 00:45:56,180
So I was like 15, I didn't want to get caught.

1042
00:45:56,180 --> 00:45:58,000
So I'd jack off for like, you know,

1043
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:00,300
eight hours straight sitting on the toilet.

1044
00:46:00,300 --> 00:46:02,660
They're like, no, I wasn't jacking off for eight hours.

1045
00:46:02,660 --> 00:46:03,860
I was shitting for eight hours.

1046
00:46:03,860 --> 00:46:05,580
(laughing)

1047
00:46:05,580 --> 00:46:06,420
It's so gay.

1048
00:46:06,420 --> 00:46:07,260
Normal in here.

1049
00:46:07,260 --> 00:46:08,100
Yeah.

1050
00:46:08,100 --> 00:46:13,100
I think I got hemorrhoids from going to the bathroom and going on my phone at work.

1051
00:46:13,100 --> 00:46:15,100
Oh dude, that's the best.

1052
00:46:15,100 --> 00:46:17,100
When you sit in the 30s.

1053
00:46:17,100 --> 00:46:19,100
You always tell a boss that you have IBS.

1054
00:46:19,100 --> 00:46:24,100
Because then you just get like 2 hours of an 8 hour shift.

1055
00:46:24,100 --> 00:46:27,100
Oh dude, it's the best feeling in the world just in the middle.

1056
00:46:27,100 --> 00:46:30,100
Like if you're working front of house and you're the only person there.

1057
00:46:30,100 --> 00:46:35,100
Just to leave and go on your phone for 30 minutes and then come back with a huge line.

1058
00:46:35,100 --> 00:46:59,100
I'm

1059
00:46:59,100 --> 00:47:05,420
but I was like, I was like, what?

1060
00:47:05,420 --> 00:47:07,900
He's like, my stomach.

1061
00:47:07,900 --> 00:47:14,860
I was like, what do you mean?

1062
00:47:14,860 --> 00:47:19,860
And he he was having diarrhea, but he didn't know how to say I'm having diarrhea.

1063
00:47:19,860 --> 00:47:21,540
Diarrhea. Isn't that a Spanish word?

1064
00:47:21,540 --> 00:47:23,620
Yeah. The role of the diarrhea.

1065
00:47:23,620 --> 00:47:25,540
Diarrhea. Diarrhea.

1066
00:47:25,620 --> 00:47:27,420
This is my cousin diarrhea.

1067
00:47:27,420 --> 00:47:30,620
But I think about that every time I have.

1068
00:47:30,620 --> 00:47:33,340
Every time you have a stomach

1069
00:47:33,340 --> 00:47:34,140
ache in your butt.

1070
00:47:34,140 --> 00:47:35,700
Yeah.

1071
00:47:35,700 --> 00:47:41,780
That's so good dude.

1072
00:47:41,780 --> 00:47:43,500
I mean, I feel bad for him, you know?

1073
00:47:43,500 --> 00:47:46,220
Yeah, I wonder like if I try

1074
00:47:46,220 --> 00:47:47,620
to not being able to tell your boss

1075
00:47:47,620 --> 00:47:48,500
you have diarrhea.

1076
00:47:48,500 --> 00:47:50,500
Yeah, like having to do

1077
00:47:50,500 --> 00:47:51,580
like charades with it.

1078
00:47:51,580 --> 00:47:53,420
I mean, I would never tell

1079
00:47:53,420 --> 00:47:55,180
an employer I had diarrhea

1080
00:47:55,180 --> 00:48:00,580
just because I don't want to go through the struggle of having to tell them that.

1081
00:48:00,580 --> 00:48:02,580
I tell my employers everything.

1082
00:48:02,580 --> 00:48:05,580
You've got to be honest, dude.

1083
00:48:05,580 --> 00:48:07,580
That's how I got no jobs.

1084
00:48:07,580 --> 00:48:11,580
First thing in the morning, every morning.

1085
00:48:11,580 --> 00:48:14,580
Do any of us have a job?

1086
00:48:14,580 --> 00:48:18,580
I have a job, but I only got one day left of it.

1087
00:48:18,580 --> 00:48:19,580
What do you do for work?

1088
00:48:19,580 --> 00:48:21,580
I work at a liquor store.

1089
00:48:21,580 --> 00:48:23,580
That is so hot.

1090
00:48:23,580 --> 00:48:25,720
- Incidentally, the cool one.

1091
00:48:25,720 --> 00:48:26,560
- Yeah.

1092
00:48:26,560 --> 00:48:27,620
- Give it up for Cameron.

1093
00:48:27,620 --> 00:48:29,580
- He always gets some like stupid beer

1094
00:48:29,580 --> 00:48:30,460
and brings it home.

1095
00:48:30,460 --> 00:48:31,300
It's pretty cool.

1096
00:48:31,300 --> 00:48:32,120
- Yeah, what was that?

1097
00:48:32,120 --> 00:48:35,500
You were drinking like a pig destroyer IPA?

1098
00:48:35,500 --> 00:48:36,340
- Yeah.

1099
00:48:36,340 --> 00:48:37,180
- Yeah.

1100
00:48:37,180 --> 00:48:38,580
- That's like a grinder bio.

1101
00:48:38,580 --> 00:48:39,580
(laughing)

1102
00:48:39,580 --> 00:48:42,060
- Pig destroyer IPA.

1103
00:48:42,060 --> 00:48:43,900
(laughing)

1104
00:48:43,900 --> 00:48:45,820
- I've had that name before.

1105
00:48:45,820 --> 00:48:47,700
- Yeah, that's Jacques Grinder.

1106
00:48:47,700 --> 00:48:49,740
(laughing)

1107
00:48:49,740 --> 00:48:53,060
- Some, a funny guy that came into my work actually,

1108
00:48:53,060 --> 00:48:55,220
I was meant to tell you guys.

1109
00:48:55,220 --> 00:48:58,420
There was this guy who came in like a day or two ago,

1110
00:48:58,420 --> 00:49:01,100
who was this like just insanely fat old guy,

1111
00:49:01,100 --> 00:49:02,820
like just like insanely fat.

1112
00:49:02,820 --> 00:49:04,620
Like he had a cane 'cause he was so fat.

1113
00:49:04,620 --> 00:49:05,460
- Oh, those are the best.

1114
00:49:05,460 --> 00:49:08,940
- And he walked in and he was like,

1115
00:49:08,940 --> 00:49:11,540
I want a two liter bottle of Pepsi.

1116
00:49:11,540 --> 00:49:14,100
And we were like, we don't have,

1117
00:49:14,100 --> 00:49:17,060
and we were like, we don't have two liter bottle of Pepsi.

1118
00:49:17,060 --> 00:49:18,620
We have a three liter bottle of Pepsi.

1119
00:49:18,620 --> 00:49:19,460
He's like, no.

1120
00:49:19,460 --> 00:49:21,980
And then he just like walked around the store

1121
00:49:21,980 --> 00:49:25,580
looking for a two liter bottle of Pepsi for like five full minutes and even

1122
00:49:25,580 --> 00:49:28,580
though like we told him we didn't have it and then finally he bought the three

1123
00:49:28,580 --> 00:49:32,420
liter one and he brought it up to the register and he looked at me and he went

1124
00:49:32,420 --> 00:49:38,620
I'll drink two liters of this and the other leaders gonna go fucking flat

1125
00:49:38,620 --> 00:49:50,140
goddamn dude that is next-level fat you're being you're like so fat you've

1126
00:49:50,140 --> 00:49:54,260
Got it down to like a science. Yeah, that's always the best. We're so fat

1127
00:49:54,260 --> 00:49:56,780
You're like I know if I have more than two

1128
00:49:56,780 --> 00:50:01,860
I can't consume more than two liters of coke and I'm going to be fucking pissed if I have to buy another

1129
00:50:01,860 --> 00:50:09,100
Only for it to go flat. Yeah, it's like fat guys who always get fat guys who like always get soda with no ice

1130
00:50:09,100 --> 00:50:13,380
Down yeah, yeah

1131
00:50:13,380 --> 00:50:15,660
God damn, that's so cool

1132
00:50:16,860 --> 00:50:18,860
Dude, you want soda so bad.

1133
00:50:18,860 --> 00:50:21,860
I want a lot of warm soda is what I like.

1134
00:50:21,860 --> 00:50:23,860
I used to be addicted to soda.

1135
00:50:23,860 --> 00:50:29,860
I'd have to get at least one or two 44-ounce fountain drinks from Circle K.

1136
00:50:29,860 --> 00:50:32,860
And I would have to get a 44-ounce of Pepsi Max.

1137
00:50:32,860 --> 00:50:38,860
And it has 44 milligrams of caffeine for every 12 fluid ounces.

1138
00:50:38,860 --> 00:50:42,860
And I would get a 44-ounce and it was just pure aspartame.

1139
00:50:42,860 --> 00:50:44,860
I'm not following any of that.

1140
00:50:44,860 --> 00:50:46,860
There's too much math in that.

1141
00:50:46,860 --> 00:50:48,860
Too many numbers for the process.

1142
00:50:48,860 --> 00:50:53,860
That's like only fat guys would say about something fluid ounces.

1143
00:50:53,860 --> 00:50:57,860
When you're talking about soda, we know that it's fluid.

1144
00:50:57,860 --> 00:51:03,860
Because you're so used to reading the label on the back,

1145
00:51:03,860 --> 00:51:05,860
because it's always in your hand,

1146
00:51:05,860 --> 00:51:07,860
that you're like, "It's fluid ounces."

1147
00:51:07,860 --> 00:51:10,860
I really appreciate the really experienced fat guys like that,

1148
00:51:10,860 --> 00:51:13,820
like that, but like understand that, okay, like the human

1149
00:51:13,820 --> 00:51:16,620
stomach can only, you know, handle two liters of liquid at

1150
00:51:16,620 --> 00:51:19,500
any one time. But I really do have a soft spot for like the

1151
00:51:19,500 --> 00:51:22,780
the beginner fat. So the ones that like, oh yeah, I'll chug

1152
00:51:22,780 --> 00:51:26,300
eight beers and you know, in five minutes and try not to

1153
00:51:26,300 --> 00:51:32,620
throw up. Yeah, exactly. Chris Farley died choking from beer.

1154
00:51:32,620 --> 00:51:37,980
He had too many beers. Yeah. And he he popped like a balloon.

1155
00:51:37,980 --> 00:51:39,980
What was the uh...

1156
00:51:39,980 --> 00:51:41,980
They just throw up foam.

1157
00:51:41,980 --> 00:51:46,980
Oh dude that's the those fucking chug videos where like the fat guys drink like the

1158
00:51:46,980 --> 00:51:48,980
Yeah yeah yeah yeah

1159
00:51:48,980 --> 00:51:50,980
Those are just the guys from the family

1160
00:51:50,980 --> 00:51:52,980
Yeah yeah

1161
00:51:52,980 --> 00:51:54,980
Shout out to them

1162
00:51:54,980 --> 00:51:56,980
I was just watching those again the other night

1163
00:51:56,980 --> 00:51:58,980
They're like the funniest fucking thing

1164
00:51:58,980 --> 00:52:00,980
Oh my god

1165
00:52:00,980 --> 00:52:02,980
The one where he starts working out and just

1166
00:52:02,980 --> 00:52:04,980
Yes yes

1167
00:52:04,980 --> 00:52:17,620

the weirdest person to just like spot yeah he there's a like oh fuck that's

1169
00:52:21,620 --> 00:52:27,580
like a that eats cactus bouncing Rachel Joe is all at a Mardi Gras parade in New

1170
00:52:27,580 --> 00:52:33,700
Orleans in 2018 you saw Rachel 2017

1171
00:52:33,700 --> 00:52:35,700
I saw Rachel at Mardi Gras.

1172
00:52:35,700 --> 00:52:37,700
At Mardi Gras?

1173
00:52:37,700 --> 00:52:39,700
(laughter)

1174
00:52:39,700 --> 00:52:42,700
Rachel told us she went to Mardi Gras in 2018.

1175
00:52:42,700 --> 00:52:44,700
2017.

1176
00:52:44,700 --> 00:52:46,700
That is literally the last place she would be.

1177
00:52:46,700 --> 00:52:48,700
No, no, no, no, no, no. 2017.

1178
00:52:48,700 --> 00:52:50,700
She just, I mean, she just likes marches.

1179
00:52:50,700 --> 00:52:52,700
That's like how she got into that whole situation.

1180
00:52:52,700 --> 00:52:54,700
(laughter)

1181
00:52:54,700 --> 00:52:56,700
She goes for her sheer love of parades.

1182
00:52:56,700 --> 00:52:57,700
Yeah.

1183
00:52:57,700 --> 00:52:59,700
No, but I swear, a few of my friends pointed...

1184
00:52:59,700 --> 00:53:00,700
You did not.

1185
00:53:00,700 --> 00:53:02,700
No, a few of my friends pointed her out.

1186
00:53:02,700 --> 00:53:17,700
is

1187
00:53:17,700 --> 00:53:19,700
Okay

00:53:19,700 --> 00:53:27,060
She's Rachel Dolezal, it's literally just like a National Geographic

1189
00:53:27,060 --> 00:53:35,260
Nope that's Mardi Gras

He's doing it yeah, he does a left for a while yet a hiatus shoe nice is on cameo

1195
00:54:09,700 --> 00:54:17,060
Wow, no way. Yeah, you can you can pay him to eat something for you. All right, I think I figured out several Christmas presents

1196
00:54:17,060 --> 00:54:24,160
Make him eat from him. I remember like just whole handles of vodka. He ate a cactus one time

1197
00:54:24,160 --> 00:54:29,100
Mm-hmm. I like when he's deodorant. Yeah, you that 15 bucks. He's so good at that

Shock 15 bucks for a shoe nice game. Look I haven't my god. That's nothing

1199
00:54:32,720 --> 00:54:39,100
I have enough stomach problems risking eating at the Quiznos across the street or eating at the Domino's next door to me

1200
00:54:39,100 --> 00:54:42,100
I mean, I think I think I can have asking for those problems.

1201
00:54:42,100 --> 00:54:46,440
We shock shock you live.

1202
00:54:46,440 --> 00:54:48,380
You live next to the first Quiznos ever.

1203
00:54:48,380 --> 00:54:49,580
I live to I live.

1204
00:54:49,580 --> 00:54:53,240
I can look directly out of my window at night and I mean, it's huge.

1205
00:54:53,240 --> 00:54:54,380
Well, you're famous.

1206
00:54:54,380 --> 00:54:59,320
When I was this is an insane thing to see on your counter.

1207
00:54:59,320 --> 00:55:00,460
Yeah, I know. I know.

1208
00:55:00,460 --> 00:55:03,960
Saltines, honey, bunch of oats and a blow towards.

1209
00:55:03,960 --> 00:55:08,200
I got poisoning from Quiznos and then I had.

1210
00:55:08,200 --> 00:55:15,200
I literally heard you say I got poop poisoning from Quiznos.

1211
00:55:15,200 --> 00:55:20,200
I basically got food poisoning from Quiznos and then I went and...

1212
00:55:20,200 --> 00:55:24,200
I've never had Quiznos. You can just tell from the branding it's trash.

1213
00:55:24,200 --> 00:55:27,200
I loved Quiznos when I was like 8.

1214
00:55:27,200 --> 00:55:29,200
It was awful. I love Subway but that was bad.

1215
00:55:29,200 --> 00:55:32,200
Do you guys remember those commercials they had?

1216
00:55:32,200 --> 00:55:33,200
Yeah, the baby.

1217
00:55:33,200 --> 00:55:36,200
The baby that says "I'm toasty."

1218
00:55:36,200 --> 00:55:43,200
is

1219
00:55:43,200 --> 00:55:50,200
that

1220
00:55:50,200 --> 00:55:57,200
the

1221
00:55:57,200 --> 00:56:04,200
the

1222
00:56:04,200 --> 00:56:11,200
the

1223
00:56:11,200 --> 00:56:14,720
You were so into the commercial that you went to the website?

1224
00:56:14,720 --> 00:56:16,720
No. No.

1225
00:56:16,720 --> 00:56:18,720
You didn't even go to the website, you just knew about it.

1226
00:56:18,720 --> 00:56:20,720
So you, yeah, you...

1227
00:56:20,720 --> 00:56:24,480
Let me explain. Let me explain why I fucking know this.

1228
00:56:24,480 --> 00:56:24,980
Okay.

1229
00:56:24,980 --> 00:56:30,000
'Cause the Spon... Okay, so the Spongebunkees were a website, they had a song about how they liked the moon,

1230
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:34,800
and then from the fucking, like, the pop...

1231
00:56:34,800 --> 00:56:40,320
Because remember, like, back in, like, 2004, like, any time that there was, like, a viral video or anything,

1232
00:56:40,320 --> 00:56:44,320
It was like, okay, we need to give this a TV show or a commercial or something.

1233
00:56:44,320 --> 00:56:48,320
So from the popularity of Spongebunkees.com, they got the Quiznos commercial,

1234
00:56:48,320 --> 00:56:52,320
where they sing about subs instead of the moon.

1235
00:56:52,320 --> 00:56:56,320
That's... wow. I'm learning so much.

1236
00:56:56,320 --> 00:57:00,320
That's so smart of you, Patrick. You should have a Pod About List spinoff where you just cover

1237
00:57:00,320 --> 00:57:04,320
like the... 2000 stuff from 2004.

1238
00:57:04,320 --> 00:57:08,320
In ads. Y'all, when Ben said, I didn't know

1239
00:57:08,320 --> 00:57:12,320
those things had names. I thought he was talking about gay people or Patrick.

1240
00:57:12,320 --> 00:57:16,320
Why would I say that?

1241
00:57:16,320 --> 00:57:20,320
I don't know those things had names.

1242
00:57:20,320 --> 00:57:24,320
No, SpongeMonkey. Oh yeah, that's cool though.

1243
00:57:24,320 --> 00:57:28,320
Also a very convenient name for either Patrick or gay people.

1244
00:57:28,320 --> 00:57:32,320
Every time Patrick talks about food, I see our parallels.

1245
00:57:32,320 --> 00:57:36,320
You guys do look alike.

1246
00:57:36,320 --> 00:57:37,400
- Hey, hold up.

1247
00:57:37,400 --> 00:57:39,080
You look like brother and sister.

1248
00:57:39,080 --> 00:57:40,120
- Hey, what's up?

1249
00:57:40,120 --> 00:57:41,240
(laughing)

1250
00:57:41,240 --> 00:57:42,520
- Is that how Pat sounds to you?

1251
00:57:42,520 --> 00:57:45,880
- Jacques just looks like the FaceTimed age.

1252
00:57:45,880 --> 00:57:48,120
(laughing)

1253
00:57:48,120 --> 00:57:51,720
- When I did first cut my hair,

1254
00:57:51,720 --> 00:57:53,540
I think we were on FaceTime and they told me

1255
00:57:53,540 --> 00:57:55,920
that I did look more like Jacques.

1256
00:57:55,920 --> 00:57:57,120
(laughing)

1257
00:57:57,120 --> 00:57:58,320
- That's beautiful.

1258
00:57:58,320 --> 00:58:00,640
- You're kind of slowly turning into the same person.

1259
00:58:00,640 --> 00:58:04,160
- Once I get the vaccine, I'm gonna pop over to Maryland

1260
00:58:04,160 --> 00:58:06,160
and get two lobsters for $6.

1261
00:58:06,160 --> 00:58:24,160
I

1262
00:58:24,160 --> 00:58:31,160
and

1263
00:58:31,160 --> 00:58:33,160
You have like a little newscaster moment.

1264
00:58:33,160 --> 00:58:37,160
Well look, this is what their faces look like now permanently.

1265
00:58:37,160 --> 00:58:40,160
[Laughter]

1266
00:58:40,160 --> 00:58:43,160
They look like Twitter liberals now for like...

1267
00:58:43,160 --> 00:58:44,160
[Laughter]

1268
00:58:44,160 --> 00:58:46,160
So I saw that too.

1269
00:58:46,160 --> 00:58:48,160
I don't think I'll have a permanent soy face.

1270
00:58:48,160 --> 00:58:49,160
Apparently it's not permanent.

1271
00:58:49,160 --> 00:58:50,160
No, it's only like two weeks.

1272
00:58:50,160 --> 00:58:54,160
But the funniest fucking thing I saw was under that on Twitter.

1273
00:58:54,160 --> 00:59:00,160
Somebody was like, "This is actually caused by a mini stroke that these people are having."

1274
00:59:00,160 --> 00:59:03,960
So it's causing a mini stroke and then somebody was like, no, it isn't like,

1275
00:59:03,960 --> 00:59:05,680
what are you talking about? And she was like, well,

1276
00:59:05,680 --> 00:59:08,440
I had this happen to me and the doctor said that I had a stroke.

1277
00:59:08,440 --> 00:59:12,520
So you just fucking had a stroke then

1278
00:59:12,520 --> 00:59:16,200
because I'm currently having a stroke.

1279
00:59:16,200 --> 00:59:18,040
There,

1280
00:59:18,040 --> 00:59:22,960
there was a time where I did get too fucked up on some stuff like in the last

1281
00:59:22,960 --> 00:59:27,040
few years and my face did stop on one side.

1282
00:59:28,720 --> 00:59:32,220
My face was stuck and drooped on the right side.

1283
00:59:32,220 --> 00:59:38,320
Whoa, and I my eye was fucked up and I was like, what the fuck and I woke up the next day and it was normal.

1284
00:59:38,320 --> 00:59:41,120
But I was like, I went to bed crying.

1285
00:59:41,120 --> 00:59:43,120
I was like, I'm going to look like this forever.

1286
00:59:43,120 --> 00:59:45,020
That was probably a really funny looking cry.

1287
00:59:45,020 --> 00:59:48,820
Yeah, on one side.

1288
00:59:48,820 --> 00:59:50,320
They're not even coming out as tears.

1289
00:59:50,320 --> 00:59:54,220
It's just like just water trickling as a solid stream.

1290
00:59:55,620 --> 00:59:58,580
That's like when Bradley Cooper was in the Elephant Man play.

1291
00:59:58,580 --> 00:59:59,580
Yeah.

1292
00:59:59,580 --> 01:00:00,580
And he just made a stupid face.

1293
01:00:00,580 --> 01:00:01,580
Yeah, he just went...

1294
01:00:01,580 --> 01:00:02,580
Yeah.

1295
01:00:02,580 --> 01:00:03,580
Wait, so cool.

1296
01:00:03,580 --> 01:00:06,180
He did that and then put his arm up like this.

1297
01:00:06,180 --> 01:00:07,180
That was...

1298
01:00:07,180 --> 01:00:08,180
Yeah, didn't even try to do prosthetics.

1299
01:00:08,180 --> 01:00:09,180
The best part of him, the prosthetics on that one.

1300
01:00:09,180 --> 01:00:11,140
It's the power of theater, dude.

1301
01:00:11,140 --> 01:00:12,140
It's the power of acting.

1302
01:00:12,140 --> 01:00:13,140
The best part of theater.

1303
01:00:13,140 --> 01:00:14,140
The best part of theater.

1304
01:00:14,140 --> 01:00:17,620
I didn't even know that he did that.

1305
01:00:17,620 --> 01:00:19,620
Like a live action Elephant Man?

1306
01:00:19,620 --> 01:00:20,620
Yeah, that was like in 2018.

1307
01:00:20,620 --> 01:00:23,620
Did he even use like prosthetics or anything?

1308
01:00:23,620 --> 01:00:24,620
No.

1309
01:00:24,620 --> 01:00:32,220
just like, it's so funny to go from doing like the hangover to doing live action.

1310
01:00:32,220 --> 01:00:37,660
Right? Yeah. Honestly, the funniest thing Bradley Cooper has ever done is when he committed

1311
01:00:37,660 --> 01:00:43,780
suicide on the Lady Gaga movie. I'm gonna tell this story and you're gonna start screaming

1312
01:00:43,780 --> 01:00:48,860
and interrupt me but don't you didn't even see that because I saw a star is born with

1313
01:00:48,860 --> 01:00:54,580
you in the movie theater and you left before you could see the climax which is Bradley Cooper

1314
01:00:54,580 --> 01:00:59,860
were dying because you wanted to go yell at the woman working at the counter because they

1315
01:00:59,860 --> 01:01:01,900
didn't bring you the donuts on time.

1316
01:01:01,900 --> 01:01:03,860
Bring the donuts, period!

1317
01:01:03,860 --> 01:01:05,860
Bring the donuts!

1318
01:01:05,860 --> 01:01:14,420
Dude, thank god Jacques unplugged the mic while you were talking.

1319
01:01:14,420 --> 01:01:17,860
I have because I know what's gonna set him off but this is exactly what happened.

1320
01:01:17,860 --> 01:01:20,860
You say that that's your favorite scene, you literally, you didn't even see it, bitch.

1321
01:01:20,860 --> 01:01:25,820
left you were gone for like 30 minutes and me and Stephen were just watching the movie being like

1322
01:01:25,820 --> 01:01:31,660
where is Jacques and then we left and the lady locked you out because you left to go smoke a

1323
01:01:31,660 --> 01:01:36,620
cigarette and then she locked the door after you left because you complained to her about not having

1324
01:01:36,620 --> 01:01:42,060
your donuts delivered in time for the climax of the movie. I paid for the donuts! I wanted them!

1325
01:01:42,060 --> 01:01:47,660
I paid for them! Yeah I mean you're right to you know you I'm guessing you ordered the donuts at

1326
01:01:47,660 --> 01:01:52,840
the beginning of the movie? Of course, of course I did. What movie theater has donuts? This

1327
01:01:52,840 --> 01:02:01,080
Alamo Draft House. You ordered them at last call. Either way, I ordered them. It's last

1328
01:02:01,080 --> 01:02:08,080
call, it's not no call. That's a really good point. Did you pay for the donuts? Yes, and

1329
01:02:08,080 --> 01:02:12,120
no one has donuts. And he complained about it and then got free tickets for other movies.

1330
01:02:12,120 --> 01:02:17,640
Yeah, I got free tickets for like three months. Yeah, there you go. Whoa. I would be focused

1331
01:02:17,640 --> 01:02:22,320
- I saw "Assassination Nation" four times in theaters.

1332
01:02:22,320 --> 01:02:25,080
'Cause I was like, "Damn, this movie is good."

1333
01:02:25,080 --> 01:02:27,880
Did y'all see that?

1334
01:02:27,880 --> 01:02:29,200
- I saw that movie. - What?

1335
01:02:29,200 --> 01:02:31,560
- That's what you did with your free movie tickets?

1336
01:02:31,560 --> 01:02:32,400
- I thought it was all right.

1337
01:02:32,400 --> 01:02:34,760
- Yeah, I also thought it was okay.

1338
01:02:34,760 --> 01:02:36,680
- It was like, at the time,

1339
01:02:36,680 --> 01:02:38,080
I thought it was just the best movie.

1340
01:02:38,080 --> 01:02:38,920
I was like, "Wow."

1341
01:02:38,920 --> 01:02:40,560
- "Assassination Nation?"

1342
01:02:40,560 --> 01:02:41,400
- Yes.

1343
01:02:41,400 --> 01:02:43,200
- You know the word "assassination," Caleb?

1344
01:02:43,200 --> 01:02:44,640
- Yeah, okay, I follow.

1345
01:02:44,640 --> 01:02:46,800
- Abra's in it as an actress.

1346
01:02:46,800 --> 01:02:53,800
that

1347
01:02:53,800 --> 01:03:00,800
part

1348
01:03:00,800 --> 01:03:04,680

1349
01:03:04,680 --> 01:03:07,860

1350
01:03:07,860 --> 01:03:11,080
where is a list of the the trailers really super edgy

1351
01:03:11,080 --> 01:03:12,600
yes it is very good

1352
01:03:12,600 --> 01:03:17,360
alternative ready your safe space it was here's our area

1353
01:03:17,360 --> 01:03:17,960
the park

1354
01:03:17,960 --> 01:03:21,640
the park renews the city and where did it

1355
01:03:21,640 --> 01:03:23,360
come on

1356
01:03:23,360 --> 01:03:25,360
it would be funny to see her do like a...

1357
01:03:25,360 --> 01:03:27,360
it's about fucking time she did

1358
01:03:27,360 --> 01:03:29,360
yeah

1359
01:03:29,360 --> 01:03:31,360
yeah for her to just become like a

1360
01:03:31,360 --> 01:03:33,360
like a lauren southern character

1361
01:03:33,360 --> 01:03:35,360
would rule

1362
01:03:35,360 --> 01:03:37,360
like one of the...

1363
01:03:37,360 --> 01:03:39,360
like bill maher type that's like

1364
01:03:39,360 --> 01:03:41,360
oh i guess you're all triggered at my intellect

1365
01:03:41,360 --> 01:03:43,360
yeah

1366
01:03:43,360 --> 01:03:45,360
harry neff in the remake of

1367
01:03:45,360 --> 01:03:47,360
the gone with the wind

1368
01:03:47,360 --> 01:03:49,360
i know

1369
01:03:49,360 --> 01:03:51,360
that doesn't track

1370
01:03:51,360 --> 01:03:55,660
Yeah, it was Bill Maher and he is.

1371
01:03:55,660 --> 01:04:00,100
He is. That's why he made that comment about being a house.

1372
01:04:00,100 --> 01:04:07,060
Sometimes you just slips in the characters to an actor.

1373
01:04:07,060 --> 01:04:11,200
Well, who should be persecuted?

1374
01:04:11,200 --> 01:04:13,400
Yeah, who should be persecuted?

1375
01:04:13,400 --> 01:04:17,160
Robin Williams.

1376
01:04:17,160 --> 01:04:20,360
You think Robin Williams should be persecuted?

1377
01:04:20,360 --> 01:04:32,440
the

1378
01:04:32,440 --> 01:04:50,440
to

1379
01:04:50,440 --> 01:04:52,840
- Yeah, she was still up on a doorknob.

1380
01:04:52,840 --> 01:04:54,920
- I know. - Epstein style.

1381
01:04:54,920 --> 01:04:55,920
- Beast mode, dude.

1382
01:04:55,920 --> 01:04:58,320
- I could say a really sad story, but I won't.

1383
01:04:58,320 --> 01:04:59,160
But I basically--

1384
01:04:59,160 --> 01:05:00,960
- Is it about Robin Williams?

1385
01:05:00,960 --> 01:05:04,400
- Yeah, one of my parents' friend's child

1386
01:05:04,400 --> 01:05:07,440
was 11 years old and--

1387
01:05:07,440 --> 01:05:10,040
- My parents' friend's child.

1388
01:05:10,040 --> 01:05:12,360
- Was 11 years old and committed suicide

1389
01:05:12,360 --> 01:05:14,640
at the same time as Robin Williams

1390
01:05:14,640 --> 01:05:17,640
after he committed suicide because he committed suicide

1391
01:05:17,640 --> 01:05:18,680
and he was her hero.

1392
01:05:18,680 --> 01:05:19,520
- Whoa.

1393
01:05:19,520 --> 01:05:23,120
Oh, so that's why I have a vendetta against them.

1394
01:05:23,120 --> 01:05:24,220
Because I can't like coolest.

1395
01:05:24,220 --> 01:05:25,320
Yeah, that he should.

1396
01:05:25,320 --> 01:05:29,320
So anyway, the reason I got a point is because I was looking

1397
01:05:29,320 --> 01:05:30,520
out of touching that one.

1398
01:05:30,520 --> 01:05:33,720
I was looking out of my out of the the big jury.

1399
01:05:33,720 --> 01:05:35,720
When I'm looking I'll create a copycat.

1400
01:05:35,720 --> 01:05:36,820
I was looking at the quiz.

1401
01:05:36,820 --> 01:05:41,120
No, the next next to the quiz knows there's this ugly disgusting

1402
01:05:41,120 --> 01:05:43,120
stupid ugly.

1403
01:05:43,120 --> 01:05:45,120
But are you on your own?

1404
01:05:45,120 --> 01:05:47,720
Are you on 14th and Grant a 13th and Grant?

1405
01:05:47,720 --> 01:05:48,620
But yes, okay.

1406
01:05:48,620 --> 01:05:50,620
It's a mural of Robin Williams.

1407
01:05:50,620 --> 01:05:52,620
Oh, I remember. Wait, that's still there?

1408
01:05:52,620 --> 01:05:54,620
Yeah, it's done so poorly.

1409
01:05:54,620 --> 01:05:56,620
It says, "We're gonna miss you, Robin."

1410
01:05:56,620 --> 01:05:58,620
Yeah.

1411
01:05:58,620 --> 01:06:00,620
They have one of those in Harvard Square.

1412
01:06:00,620 --> 01:06:02,620
They have like a Mrs. Doubtfire mural.

1413
01:06:02,620 --> 01:06:04,620
Yeah, they do it after you die.

1414
01:06:04,620 --> 01:06:06,620
It's so much cooler.

1415
01:06:06,620 --> 01:06:08,620
Mrs. Doubtfire also committed suicide.

1416
01:06:08,620 --> 01:06:10,620
[laughter]

1417
01:06:10,620 --> 01:06:12,620
After I looked at the mural,

1418
01:06:12,620 --> 01:06:14,620
I googled

1419
01:06:14,620 --> 01:06:16,620
Robin Williams as

1420
01:06:16,620 --> 01:06:23,420
cerebral palsy actor because I thought he had to have had a movie where he played

1421
01:06:23,420 --> 01:06:27,980
as someone with cerebral palsy. Wait, what was the Google search? I Google searched

1422
01:06:27,980 --> 01:06:38,340
Robin Williams cerebral palsy actor. Just to clarify, that's the actor Robin Williams and not the professor with cerebral palsy.

1423
01:06:38,340 --> 01:06:44,500
I'm looking at this mural and I'm like how did Robin Williams have

1424
01:06:44,500 --> 01:06:48,820
cerebral palsy and I didn't know. That's like, did you think he had cerebral palsy?

1425
01:06:48,820 --> 01:06:54,020
I don't know. It's on the mural. If you could see the mural. It's all about the mural.

1426
01:06:54,020 --> 01:07:00,020
You thought he died from cancer. He was not even suicided. Like, oh, clearly he died from

1427
01:07:00,020 --> 01:07:04,980
cerebral palsy. No, but the picture, there's nothing wrong with people.

1428
01:07:04,980 --> 01:07:08,260
Jacques, what are these? Do you have those Buddhist flags up behind you?

1429
01:07:08,260 --> 01:07:11,860
This is not, this is my, I'm staying at a friend's apartment.

1430
01:07:13,300 --> 01:07:14,300
I'm living in a living room.

1431
01:07:14,300 --> 01:07:15,800
It looks a little too functional for you.

1432
01:07:15,800 --> 01:07:16,300
Yeah.

1433
01:07:16,300 --> 01:07:17,600
What do you mean?

1434
01:07:17,600 --> 01:07:20,600
Yeah, it's not messy enough to be a Jean-Claude.

1435
01:07:20,600 --> 01:07:22,800
I'm guessing the blowtorch is yours.

1436
01:07:22,800 --> 01:07:24,900
Yeah, you can see my mattress on the floor.

1437
01:07:24,900 --> 01:07:25,600
That's mine.

1438
01:07:25,600 --> 01:07:27,000
And a fruit bowl.

1439
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:28,300
That's what I'm talking about.

1440
01:07:28,300 --> 01:07:30,200
Yeah, looks like a nice place.

1441
01:07:30,200 --> 01:07:33,800
I love the celebrity murals, especially in LA.

1442
01:07:33,800 --> 01:07:34,900
There's one that's like,

1443
01:07:34,900 --> 01:07:36,400
it's like,

1444
01:07:36,400 --> 01:07:38,100
the Armenian Genocide.

1445
01:07:38,100 --> 01:07:41,100
It's my favorite mural.

1446
01:07:41,100 --> 01:07:42,900
It reminds me of the Armenian Genocide.

1447
01:07:42,900 --> 01:07:48,400
There's one that is like it's like it says like lost legends and it's it says

1448
01:07:48,400 --> 01:07:52,400
has Nipsey Hussle, Juice WRLD, Little Peep, and Anthony Bourdain.

1449
01:07:52,400 --> 01:07:55,400
[Laughter]

1450
01:07:55,400 --> 01:07:57,400
Yeah, it's so good.

1451
01:07:57,400 --> 01:07:58,400
They rock.

1452
01:07:58,400 --> 01:07:59,900
They should add Dr. Sebi to that.

1453
01:07:59,900 --> 01:08:02,400
XXXTentacion and like Anthony Bourdain.

1454
01:08:02,400 --> 01:08:03,400
[Laughter]

1455
01:08:03,400 --> 01:08:07,400
I was reading some celebrity article about celebrities doing drugs.

1456
01:08:07,400 --> 01:08:09,400
Celebrity article about celebrities?

1457
01:08:09,400 --> 01:08:23,280
the

1458
01:08:23,280 --> 01:08:30,280
like

1459
01:08:30,280 --> 01:08:49,840
on

1460
01:08:49,840 --> 01:09:09,400
a

1461
01:09:09,400 --> 01:09:11,400
I think it's an alien.

1462
01:09:11,400 --> 01:09:14,300
And so having sex with a 14 year old or something.

1463
01:09:14,300 --> 01:09:17,000
Well, yeah, he was married to Asia Argento.

1464
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:18,640
I think they were partners.

1465
01:09:18,640 --> 01:09:19,880
So I don't think they were married.

1466
01:09:19,880 --> 01:09:22,580
And she's I don't even know who she is.

1467
01:09:22,580 --> 01:09:25,740
She has a very funny name that reminds me of cheese.

1468
01:09:25,740 --> 01:09:28,920
Asia. She's of the of the Argento cheese.

1469
01:09:28,920 --> 01:09:30,680
Yeah. Dario's daughter.

1470
01:09:30,680 --> 01:09:32,180
She's Dario's. Wait, really?

1471
01:09:32,180 --> 01:09:35,460
Oh, listen, hello.

1472
01:09:35,460 --> 01:09:36,820
That's how she's Italian.

1473
01:09:36,820 --> 01:09:38,260
Of course, she's fucking a 14 year old.

1474
01:09:38,260 --> 01:09:40,700
Listen to this though, yeah, she got, she got,

1475
01:09:40,700 --> 01:09:42,260
so she was on a movie called

1476
01:09:42,260 --> 01:09:45,420
The Heart is Despicable Above All Things.

1477
01:09:45,420 --> 01:09:48,020
So sometime in the 2000s,

1478
01:09:48,020 --> 01:09:50,500
and it was an art house movie where she plays like

1479
01:09:50,500 --> 01:09:54,340
a drug addicted, horrible whore mother,

1480
01:09:54,340 --> 01:09:57,180
who like that, like a prostitute.

1481
01:09:57,180 --> 01:09:59,380
- She plays a stupid whore.

1482
01:09:59,380 --> 01:10:00,220
- But listen to this.

1483
01:10:00,220 --> 01:10:01,620
- And it's just like a mother.

1484
01:10:01,620 --> 01:10:02,460
- She gets custody.

1485
01:10:02,460 --> 01:10:04,540
- It's just a dumb, dumb whore.

1486
01:10:04,540 --> 01:10:05,500
- No, listen, listen.

1487
01:10:05,500 --> 01:10:08,500
She gets custody of her child again,

1488
01:10:08,500 --> 01:10:12,140
and she brings the child across the United States

1489
01:10:12,140 --> 01:10:14,740
and convinces him to be a child prostitute

1490
01:10:14,740 --> 01:10:16,100
as well as she's prostituting.

1491
01:10:16,100 --> 01:10:18,940
And Marilyn Manson is an actor in this movie

1492
01:10:18,940 --> 01:10:20,500
and fucks the child.

1493
01:10:20,500 --> 01:10:21,340
- When did this come out?

1494
01:10:21,340 --> 01:10:23,020
- It's just like a dream you had.

1495
01:10:23,020 --> 01:10:26,420
- No, no, this is a real Aja Argento movie.

1496
01:10:26,420 --> 01:10:29,060
And then apparently the young kid

1497
01:10:29,060 --> 01:10:31,100
that was the actor in the movie

1498
01:10:31,100 --> 01:10:35,060
ended up having a sexual relationship with Aja Argento

1499
01:10:35,060 --> 01:10:36,980
as soon as he turned 18.

1500
01:10:36,980 --> 01:10:40,380
Well, that's kind of, yeah.

1501
01:10:40,380 --> 01:10:42,180
So it's, it's dementia.

1502
01:10:42,180 --> 01:10:44,480
There's triple X too.

1503
01:10:44,480 --> 01:10:45,100
That's weird.

1504
01:10:45,100 --> 01:10:50,260
Yeah, no, she was, I think she should be canceled for being on in that fucking

1505
01:10:50,260 --> 01:10:53,740
shit of a movie, that massive fucking turd.

1506
01:10:53,740 --> 01:10:55,980
That's one of my favorite movies of all time.

1507
01:10:55,980 --> 01:10:57,020
How could you say that?

1508
01:10:57,020 --> 01:10:57,900
It's too, I think.

1509
01:10:57,900 --> 01:11:00,420
And triple X is one of the best movies of all time.

1510
01:11:00,420 --> 01:11:01,100
That's terrible.

1511
01:11:01,100 --> 01:11:02,180
Was she in the sequel?

1512
01:11:02,180 --> 01:11:03,140
Not in the sequel.

1513
01:11:03,140 --> 01:11:04,220
She gave up on it.

1514
01:11:04,260 --> 01:11:06,260
Oh my the sequel so much better

1515
01:11:06,260 --> 01:11:15,020
It's been diesel yeah, I remember that Vin Diesel was really hot in that movie when I was a kid. Oh my god

1516
01:11:15,020 --> 01:11:21,660
Come on wake up the band orbital is playing in the club scene at

1517
01:11:21,660 --> 01:11:28,860
The triple X movie. I've never seen triple X. Oh you was orbital. Okay. Okay. Never mind. That's fucking sick, dude

1518
01:11:28,860 --> 01:11:33,660
I think I heard some we every watch you know what we're gonna do what for triple for triple X here

1519
01:11:33,660 --> 01:11:35,820
what Felix just did to Avatar.

1520
01:11:35,820 --> 01:11:39,180
Everyone's like, Avatar's a piece of shit.

1521
01:11:39,180 --> 01:11:42,860
All those blue monkeys keep like fucking with their ponytails or whatever.

1522
01:11:42,860 --> 01:11:45,580
And now it's like, oh, my God, it's so revolutionary.

1523
01:11:45,580 --> 01:11:51,220
It's it's it's this Marxist thesis on like capitalism and shit or whatever.

1524
01:11:51,220 --> 01:11:56,900
People do cosplay of Avatar or secretly wanting to do blackface.

1525
01:11:56,900 --> 01:11:58,260
Try to convince.

1526
01:11:58,260 --> 01:12:01,380
Explain your

1527
01:12:03,180 --> 01:12:05,740
I think we could just leave it on that.

1528
01:12:05,740 --> 01:12:08,940
I don't even need to hear an explanation on that one.

1529
01:12:08,940 --> 01:12:10,340
I'm saying that without being cancelled.

1530
01:12:10,340 --> 01:12:11,860
So don't explain that.

1531
01:12:11,860 --> 01:12:12,360
Yeah.

1532
01:12:12,360 --> 01:12:14,660
[LAUGHTER]

1533
01:12:14,660 --> 01:12:15,380
I'm just saying--

1534
01:12:15,380 --> 01:12:15,880
No.

1535
01:12:15,880 --> 01:12:16,380
No.

1536
01:12:16,380 --> 01:12:18,220
[LAUGHTER]

1537
01:12:18,220 --> 01:12:18,980
It just looks--

1538
01:12:18,980 --> 01:12:19,860
It looks--

1539
01:12:19,860 --> 01:12:22,340
We're going to save you from yourself here on the episode.

1540
01:12:22,340 --> 01:12:22,840
Yeah.

1541
01:12:22,840 --> 01:12:23,340
Yeah.

1542
01:12:23,340 --> 01:12:24,140
Cut it out then.

1543
01:12:24,140 --> 01:12:24,640
There's no--

1544
01:12:24,640 --> 01:12:27,620
[LAUGHTER]

1545
01:12:27,620 --> 01:12:28,740
No shot.

1546
01:12:28,740 --> 01:12:29,240
No.

1547
01:12:29,240 --> 01:12:30,140
No, he's scared.

1548
01:12:30,140 --> 01:12:31,140
You get to cut that out.

1549
01:12:31,140 --> 01:12:31,640
He's scared.

1550
01:12:31,640 --> 01:12:32,140
No.

1551
01:12:32,140 --> 01:12:33,020
Can I just have one?

1552
01:12:33,020 --> 01:12:34,820
Can I have one sentence to just clarify?

1553
01:12:34,820 --> 01:12:35,900
- You have one word.

1554
01:12:35,900 --> 01:12:36,740
- Yeah.

1555
01:12:36,740 --> 01:12:37,580
- Can not be here.

1556
01:12:37,580 --> 01:12:42,560
- What I was trying to say is that

1557
01:12:42,560 --> 01:12:45,980
I see a lot of white people on Tinder

1558
01:12:45,980 --> 01:12:49,020
in full cosplay of Avatar.

1559
01:12:49,020 --> 01:12:49,860
- What?

1560
01:12:49,860 --> 01:12:50,680
- No you don't.

1561
01:12:50,680 --> 01:12:51,520
- When?

1562
01:12:51,520 --> 01:12:52,340
- No you don't.

1563
01:12:52,340 --> 01:12:53,180
- You're just lying.

1564
01:12:53,180 --> 01:12:54,020
- I am not lying.

1565
01:12:54,020 --> 01:12:54,840
- I wanna see where this goes.

1566
01:12:54,840 --> 01:12:55,980
- Now you're scared of people.

1567
01:12:55,980 --> 01:12:57,680
- Okay, I'm sorry, we interrupted you.

1568
01:12:57,680 --> 01:12:59,420
- No, I'm just kidding.

1569
01:12:59,420 --> 01:13:00,260
- I just see these people.

1570
01:13:00,260 --> 01:13:01,840
- I wanna see these people too.

1571
01:13:01,840 --> 01:13:03,100
(laughing)

1572
01:13:03,100 --> 01:13:05,940
- And normally they have, they even in the costume.

1573
01:13:05,940 --> 01:13:08,180
- I guess it's gay guys and straight women that you see.

1574
01:13:08,180 --> 01:13:13,180
- Yes, so I really, I have screenshots of it on my old phone.

1575
01:13:13,180 --> 01:13:14,260
There's three different people I found on Tinder.

1576
01:13:14,260 --> 01:13:16,340
- You're gonna need to produce a lot of documents

1577
01:13:16,340 --> 01:13:18,020
for the things you said on this.

1578
01:13:18,020 --> 01:13:19,900
Rachel Dolezal and a dashiki.

1579
01:13:19,900 --> 01:13:20,740
- That's, that's--

1580
01:13:20,740 --> 01:13:22,740
- I'll upload a dossier.

1581
01:13:22,740 --> 01:13:25,620
- It's true, I have no reason to lie.

1582
01:13:25,620 --> 01:13:26,820
- Okay, keep going.

1583
01:13:26,820 --> 01:13:29,540
- Anyway, I just see these people in there,

1584
01:13:29,540 --> 01:13:33,740
they have what dreads and they are posting all of this,

1585
01:13:33,740 --> 01:13:36,940
like woke ass nonsense,

1586
01:13:36,940 --> 01:13:41,300
like just like relating that they're like,

1587
01:13:41,300 --> 01:13:45,460
they are the ultimate cause fighting against racism,

1588
01:13:45,460 --> 01:13:49,460
but they have white dreads or something like, you know, the type of person.

1589
01:13:49,460 --> 01:13:53,740
I feel like there are only like nine people though. And where does avatar wait?

1590
01:13:53,740 --> 01:13:54,820
Yeah. Do you think that just like,

1591
01:13:54,820 --> 01:13:57,340
so anytime you see a white person dreadlocks, you're like,

1592
01:13:57,340 --> 01:13:58,340
You think that they're good?

1593
01:13:58,340 --> 01:14:00,340
Listen, we love we all love Avatar.

1594
01:14:00,340 --> 01:14:02,980
They had a little much.

1595
01:14:02,980 --> 01:14:07,100
They had Avatar cosplay in their pictures of 10.

1596
01:14:07,100 --> 01:14:11,420
Oh, they had normal pictures and then they would get to an Avatar cosplay picture.

1597
01:14:11,420 --> 01:14:12,900
And I'm like, are you kidding me?

1598
01:14:12,900 --> 01:14:13,900
How many?

1599
01:14:13,900 --> 01:14:15,700
And this seems like an isolated incident.

1600
01:14:15,700 --> 01:14:18,340
This is not like this at least three or four.

1601
01:14:18,340 --> 01:14:20,260
And also, yeah, once you get past three.

1602
01:14:20,260 --> 01:14:25,620
Also, I'm just going to say this, you know, there's like people who are clearly like on

1603
01:14:25,620 --> 01:14:38,600
the

1604
01:14:38,600 --> 01:15:07,600
I

1605
01:15:07,600 --> 01:15:09,600
Alright, well thanks for coming on.

1606
01:15:09,600 --> 01:15:11,600
[Laughter]

1607
01:15:11,600 --> 01:15:13,600
Take it off! Take it off!

1608
01:15:13,600 --> 01:15:15,600
No, there's no chance.

1609
01:15:15,600 --> 01:15:17,600
No.

1610
01:15:17,600 --> 01:15:19,600
As long as I don't sound cancelable, I'm good.

1611
01:15:19,600 --> 01:15:21,600
You won't. It's okay.

1612
01:15:21,600 --> 01:15:23,600
I'm just giving you shit.

1613
01:15:23,600 --> 01:15:25,600
Go listen to Seeking Derangements.

1614
01:15:25,600 --> 01:15:27,600
They're the best. Thank you so much.

1615
01:15:27,600 --> 01:15:29,600
We love them. Thank you guys for coming on.

1616
01:15:29,600 --> 01:15:31,600
And if you're not already listening to Pods About Lists,

1617
01:15:31,600 --> 01:15:33,600
then you don't have to.

1618
01:15:33,600 --> 01:15:35,600
I'm literally listening to it right now.

1619
01:15:35,600 --> 01:15:40,880
Bye y'all.
