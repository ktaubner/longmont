1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,580
(upbeat music)

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:10,120
- Wow, man.

3
00:00:10,120 --> 00:00:12,600
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

4
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:17,000
- We're doing Orthodox Ristmas this year,

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,440
celebrating it a little bit late.

6
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:20,920
- More like Dork-th-Ducks with the--

7
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:21,760
- Dork-th-Ducks.

8
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:23,600
- Guys I'm seeing in this call right now.

9
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:25,200
- Yeah, I mean, that's fair to say.

10
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:26,480
- I should've worn my fucking glasses,

11
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:27,880
I feel so fucking embarrassed.

12
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:30,700
- We got, who do we got over here?

13
00:00:30,700 --> 00:00:35,800
A caveman, you know, that you kind of look like a caveman.

14
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:37,800
- Yeah, and an army guy, look his hat, his camouflage.

15
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:41,720
- Yeah, a punk rock army guy and Daria,

16
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:44,000
you could be Daria over there.

17
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,240
- Amir Perales.

18
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:46,880
- The male Daria, Dario.

19
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:48,840
- Male Daria, male Dario.

20
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:49,960
- Maybe the best of the three,

21
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:52,160
I'm happy to be the male Daria.

22
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:54,480
- Yeah, I'd hate to be a giant buff caveman,

23
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:57,720
that would be pretty embarrassing to be called that.

24
00:00:57,720 --> 00:00:58,220
I'm not buff.

25
00:00:58,220 --> 00:01:00,000
Wait, is I the caveman?

26
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,120
Are you buff?

27
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:02,240
I think of you as a buff.

28
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:03,160
I'm not really buff.

29
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:04,560
I'm large.

30
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:05,060
But what--

31
00:01:05,060 --> 00:01:06,520
Not really toned.

32
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:07,920
It's just a lot of stuff.

33
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:10,080
Well, can I see it?

34
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:12,120
Can you take his shirt off?

35
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:13,280
Can you take off your shirt?

36
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:14,380
Yeah, give me some posing.

37
00:01:14,380 --> 00:01:15,480
Give me some posing.

38
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:16,440
He's getting up.

39
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:16,920
Holy shit.

40
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:17,760
OK.

41
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:19,640
He's shaking the entire room around.

42
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:21,760
Oh my god.

43
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:23,040
Whoa.

44
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:25,280
You are the bodybuilding sage at the Olympia.

45
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:26,680
Branson, can you smile for us?

46
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:28,680
You look so pretty when you smile.

47
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:30,680
That's how you hit it from the back?

48
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:32,680
That's the first gump.

49
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:34,680
That's the gump.

50
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:36,680
That's the gump.

51
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:38,680
He's such a piece of ass.

52
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:40,680
He's such a piece of ass.

53
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:42,680
I have a question now that you've panned up.

54
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:44,680
Why do you have a TV mounting

55
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:46,680
bracket and no TV?

56
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:48,680
Cause uh, well we

57
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:50,680
just moved in two months ago. We haven't got around

58
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:52,680
to it cause we gotta paint the room.

59
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:54,680
Cause this used to be a little girls room and it's all painted.

60
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:58,360
TV there though cuz it's opposite from your computer so you'd have to sit backwards

61
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:10,320
Should do is he should put a TV there that's playing like screw tube behind them

62
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:13,400
I mean you can watch it when we record e1 Andrew. We'll just watch yeah

63
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:17,400
You can put a mirror on top of this

64
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:22,280
Yeah, and the Brad's can see it. It'll be reversed or just paint the room in mirror

65
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:29,620
Oh, you could just use mirror paint. Yeah. Yeah, I really do like this setup of you're going to paint the room

66
00:02:29,620 --> 00:02:31,620
So you already put the bracket up?

67
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:34,980
Take it off to paint it. Okay, it was already there

68
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:41,060
Because the bracket came with it like was that an up charge kind of thing. I don't think at that point

69
00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:45,200
They're really worried about that. I think they charge you more. I don't think they did

70
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:49,520
We do have big fake like a like two huge fake fireplaces

71
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:51,600
that uh

72
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:56,960
Don't really know what to do with in here. So, you know warm yourself up man

73
00:02:56,960 --> 00:03:02,760
We're not real fireplaces or fake a cast-iron pot. I'll ever get a big stew going

74
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:06,200
Screen. Oh, it's like an electro

75
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:09,400
It's it says it's a heater too, but it hasn't you know

76
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:14,440
I don't think it really gets hot that doesn't mean you can't put a cast-iron pot and get a stew going

77
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:16,080
sous-vide

78
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:18,360
He made a cast-iron pizza. That was crazy

79
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:26,480
pizza yeah that actually worked. Andrew was just here for new years eve and the day. Really?

80
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:32,360
I went to the casino and won big. Yeah we hit big. Well you're an amazing gambler man every

81
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:38,760
time that I've been over there I think we've gone to the casino and you've always dominated.

82
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:43,360
Yeah money fraud helps me. I think Branson said he ended up about $15 up. That's huge.

83
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:48,360
Money moves. We were about to leave because we were so sleepy at 12.15 and we had like

84
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:53,920
$19 left on our vouchers and so we decided to blast them which made a blast them you

85
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:58,240
put them in the nearest slot machine and you bet the highest amount you can't be

86
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:04,980
a man all gone yeah and then I won $55 I was blessed by money frog you got a

87
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:09,320
blast him it was six I think it was six bucks each time I won the mini jackpot

88
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:15,040
it was $14 look at that cat what do you guys want to see your podcast ratings go

89
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:19,400
up you gotta put a fucking cat on there mm-hmm we don't want to be else in house

90
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:25,920
no we used to I had no idea that you were the size of a cat yeah I'm already

91
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:37,600
looking at five pussies in Patrick in that means I'm one of the pussies that

92
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:39,100
No, that's a button that's for your bed.

93
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:41,140
Four chairs back there.

94
00:04:41,140 --> 00:04:41,700
What's up, pussy?

95
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:42,600
There's not people in there.

96
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:43,700
Because Patrick's got that dog in him.

97
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:47,000
There's not people on these chairs.

98
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,800
Patrick, did no one want to join you at the studio?

99
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:50,280
Did they not like to spend time with you?

100
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:52,280
No, I just didn't want to record it at home.

101
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:53,440
We'd have to all sit around and...

102
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:55,080
Well, you don't have a way to record at home.

103
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:55,920
No, I do now.

104
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:57,780
I have that shitty laptop that I found at home.

105
00:04:57,780 --> 00:04:59,520
Pat has a genius setup.

106
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:01,620
Pat has a genius setup of he brings...

107
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:05,360
He put his computer at work so that when he's playing video games,

108
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:08,160
he can be saying that he's at work,

109
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:11,680
which is the biggest, highest IQ thing of all time.

110
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:13,480
- Yeah, that's pretty good.

111
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:16,520
- I go home, my girlfriend asks me what I'm playing.

112
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:19,200
- It's any DLC a business expense, right?

113
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:20,200
- Pretty much.

114
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:22,200
- Yeah, I buy all the Arkham.

115
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:23,400
- Eight hours a day.

116
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:25,720
- Playing Bubble Popper for six hours.

117
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:26,980
- Cookie Clicker.

118
00:05:26,980 --> 00:05:30,200
- Booby Booby Panic 2, the porno games on Steam.

119
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:32,920
- Dead or Alive, Extreme Volleyball.

120
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:34,600
I've been here playing that.

121
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:36,720
Oh, I've been playing Leisure Suit Larry.

122
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:39,360
I've been playing, what was that one that I bought,

123
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:42,280
Julio, on stream, do you remember?

124
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:45,760
- Oh, was it the?

125
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:47,920
- It was a cuckolding fantasy 3D--

126
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:49,120
- Cuckold simulator?

127
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:50,160
- Yeah, yeah.

128
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:51,800
- Called Petra Simulator? - Cuckold Simulator.

129
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:52,640
No!

130
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:54,200
- Oh, dang. - Ha ha!

131
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:55,720
All right, that's the episode, I gotta go.

132
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:56,560
I'll see you guys later.

133
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:57,640
(laughing)

134
00:05:57,640 --> 00:06:00,240
- It was, I didn't realize how many porn games are on Steam.

135
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:01,980
There was one, my friend Rex got mad at me.

136
00:06:01,980 --> 00:06:03,400
Tell me if you think this is weird.

137
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:08,400
- There was a porn game called like Vampires Molestation

138
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:10,860
or something like this.

139
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:11,700
- Oh, I know that one.

140
00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:13,200
- And you, yeah, it's really good.

141
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:16,920
And you, it's like $4 and I bought it

142
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:20,320
and me and Julio played it for a little while

143
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:23,120
and I made, you create a character

144
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:26,500
that you basically can put in different poses as a vampire.

145
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:28,120
And I made my buddy Rex

146
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:30,400
and took a bunch of screenshots of it

147
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:31,500
without telling him.

148
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:35,980
And then one day I was streaming it in Discord to Julio,

149
00:06:35,980 --> 00:06:39,580
and he joined and just saw a version of him

150
00:06:39,580 --> 00:06:42,700
with his ankles tied to his wrists

151
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:46,580
and giant bat wings coming off and huge tits.

152
00:06:46,580 --> 00:06:47,580
And he got all mad at me.

153
00:06:47,580 --> 00:06:49,460
He thought that was weird that I did that.

154
00:06:49,460 --> 00:06:50,500
- How's that weird?

155
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:51,700
- That's what I'm saying, man.

156
00:06:51,700 --> 00:06:53,180
I thought it was-- - It's a celebration.

157
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:54,260
- Did he know it wasn't real?

158
00:06:54,260 --> 00:06:55,180
That's not real.

159
00:06:55,180 --> 00:06:56,020
- Yeah.

160
00:06:56,020 --> 00:06:56,860
- Well, I had to explain that to him.

161
00:06:56,860 --> 00:06:58,780
- He doesn't have big boobies, right?

162
00:06:58,780 --> 00:07:00,860
- Yeah, I had to explain that to him.

163
00:07:00,860 --> 00:07:05,580
One time on Steam, I also think this is why they advertise a lot of porn games to me.

164
00:07:05,580 --> 00:07:09,580
One time I gifted Ben from Eat Chain Pregnancy the game.

165
00:07:09,580 --> 00:07:10,580
What's Pregnancy?

166
00:07:10,580 --> 00:07:14,420
It's just a game where you're pregnant, but he didn't accept it.

167
00:07:14,420 --> 00:07:15,420
So you just have it in your inventory.

168
00:07:15,420 --> 00:07:16,420
Sounds like a bad friend.

169
00:07:16,420 --> 00:07:19,100
Do you just eat nickels when you get a craving?

170
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:22,660
I think it's like a visual novel, like emotional.

171
00:07:22,660 --> 00:07:25,580
Like there's no, like it's just emotional or something.

172
00:07:25,580 --> 00:07:26,580
It's not fetishistical.

173
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:27,580
No.

174
00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:28,580
I hate emotional.

175
00:07:28,580 --> 00:07:34,780
I think that every game should have porn in it and zero emotions and only guys and then

176
00:07:34,780 --> 00:07:35,780
one girl.

177
00:07:35,780 --> 00:07:39,080
That's kind of like what we were talking about on E1 recently.

178
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:44,620
They need to make a horny version of 2K where you have the dick-sized slider, you can date

179
00:07:44,620 --> 00:07:45,620
other players.

180
00:07:45,620 --> 00:07:46,900
It's like Harvest Moon or something.

181
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:50,380
Isn't that Cyberpunk, basically?

182
00:07:50,380 --> 00:07:53,380
They need to have 2K with Baldur's Gate level of relationships.

183
00:07:53,380 --> 00:07:55,100
Yeah, you still play basketball in 2K.

184
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:56,100
You just are in a relationship.

185
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:58,220
Well, they have all those games like Football Manager.

186
00:07:58,220 --> 00:08:00,260
You can have like, only fans manager.

187
00:08:00,260 --> 00:08:05,540
It's like a guy with like, two like, bad tattoos and slick back hair and sunglasses.

188
00:08:05,540 --> 00:08:07,860
This is how we reboot Leisure Suit Larry.

189
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:08,860
Oh yeah.

190
00:08:08,860 --> 00:08:11,460
Leisure Suit Larry is now an only fans manager.

191
00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:15,140
I don't think it's about, I don't think it should be that every game should just have

192
00:08:15,140 --> 00:08:16,940
the option to be fucking everybody.

193
00:08:16,940 --> 00:08:20,780
I mean, I think it's like, it's exactly I think the lesson that we take from Baldur's

194
00:08:20,780 --> 00:08:24,500
Gate 3 that was so successful is, oh every game you should be able to on the side fuck

195
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:25,820
a squid.

196
00:08:25,820 --> 00:08:26,820
That should always be an option.

197
00:08:26,820 --> 00:08:31,820
I'm a total pussy when I'm playing a video game and somebody's throwing their video game pussy at me. Get out of here!

198
00:08:31,820 --> 00:08:36,820
You think every single game? You think Ernie's adventures in space? You think Elmo's shape adventure?

199
00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:39,820
No, your favorite games don't have to have that in them, I guess.

200
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:41,820
Because you get scared when you see that stuff, I forgot.

201
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:44,820
Elmo and Ernie are kids though. I think they're adults.

202
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:47,820
It's okay, there's nothing wrong with that. They are adults.

203
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:49,820
Bert and Ernie are adults?

204
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:50,820
I think so.

205
00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:52,820
They live together.

206
00:08:52,820 --> 00:08:53,820
They're roommates.

207
00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:56,180
- Their fan base are children, but they're adults.

208
00:08:56,180 --> 00:08:58,060
They can do whatever sexually they want.

209
00:08:58,060 --> 00:08:59,220
- They're made out of clothes.

210
00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:00,980
They're not adults or kids.

211
00:09:00,980 --> 00:09:02,620
They don't, it doesn't matter if they,

212
00:09:02,620 --> 00:09:05,280
I mean, I don't want to see them have sex.

213
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:06,120
- I'll say that.

214
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:07,860
- If they have sex, also they're puppets,

215
00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:10,140
so it'd just be two guys' hands going like this.

216
00:09:10,140 --> 00:09:10,980
- Exactly.

217
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:11,820
- It's fine.

218
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:13,260
- There's already videos of that that you can see.

219
00:09:13,260 --> 00:09:15,580
- Yeah, I can watch that anywhere.

220
00:09:15,580 --> 00:09:17,660
I can watch that on the fucking street corner over here.

221
00:09:17,660 --> 00:09:18,500
- I can do that for myself.

222
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:19,340
- You just saw that shit on the evening news.

223
00:09:19,340 --> 00:09:20,160
- Right now.

224
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:21,000
- Just say to a guy on the sidewalk,

225
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,500
"Hey, dude, you ever see one of these?"

226
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:23,380
(laughing)

227
00:09:23,380 --> 00:09:26,180
Oh, which street corner is that Patrick?

228
00:09:26,180 --> 00:09:27,900
Which street corner is that?

229
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:29,940
New York City, baby.

230
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:34,940
It is 34th and 42nd.

231
00:09:34,940 --> 00:09:37,160
Hmm.

232
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:39,780
You guys hang out at Times Square a lot?

233
00:09:39,780 --> 00:09:40,620
Yeah, sometimes.

234
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:41,460
You know it, guys.

235
00:09:41,460 --> 00:09:43,560
Honestly, more than you would think.

236
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:45,080
You do hang out there a lot.

237
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:47,900
I go there any time someone comes into the city,

238
00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:50,540
any time somebody visits, I go to Times Square

239
00:09:50,540 --> 00:09:51,380
and we always do the M&M's store.

240
00:09:51,380 --> 00:09:53,080
But you gotta do the M&M scan.

241
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:53,920
- Well, you're a hip hopper, so you gotta go there.

242
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:55,200
- You gotta scan, whenever someone visits,

243
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:56,420
you have to take them to the M&M store

244
00:09:56,420 --> 00:09:58,360
and scan them to see what color M&M they are.

245
00:09:58,360 --> 00:09:59,760
- You gotta hail a yellow taxi cab,

246
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:01,400
be like, "If we don't make it to Lady Liberty

247
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:03,440
"in 15 minutes, we're finished, we gotta get there,

248
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:04,280
"we gotta see everything."

249
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:06,740
- I always have something I gotta do at Lady Liberty.

250
00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:08,080
There's always some kind of big,

251
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:09,560
hot shot style meeting there.

252
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:11,120
- Don't forget the Empire State Building.

253
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:12,720
- Last time I was in Times Square,

254
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:14,840
we went to Margaritaville.

255
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:17,320
- Ooh. - Oh, congrats.

256
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:19,160
- They gave us a Christmas card for free.

257
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:20,720
I've never had a bad time at Times Square.

258
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:21,640
- Oh my God.

259
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:22,760
Everybody cheats on Times Square.

260
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:24,520
- Was it December or what time of year was it?

261
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:26,680
- Well, Times Square is just short for good times square.

262
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:27,520
- Exactly.

263
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:29,360
- It was January, that might've been a leftover card.

264
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:30,840
- It was the end of November, man.

265
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:32,800
They were starting to share early.

266
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:35,280
- It's a card that they take your photo.

267
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:39,160
It's like, wait, Julio, are you about to show it?

268
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:42,400
'Cause it's hanging up on my fridge.

269
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:43,840
- I have one on my fridge too, man.

270
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:48,400
- Yeah, Julio, it's a photo of Julio,

271
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:53,400
My roommate Noah, Caleb, and two other guys.

272
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:54,600
We have lightning blue jerseys.

273
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:56,800
But wait, what were their names?

274
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:59,640
Brian and Alex.

275
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:01,840
Yep, thanks Pat.

276
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:03,560
It's a photo where their legs are tied up

277
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:04,960
and they have big titties.

278
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:06,960
There it is guys.

279
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:07,800
Oh, wow.

280
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:09,560
So this is the kind of fun that you have

281
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:12,400
when you go to Times Square, you become completely blurry

282
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:15,480
and you have a purple and blue drink.

283
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:16,640
Look at that, dude.

284
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:18,080
I mean, these guys are having the most fun

285
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:22,800
they've ever had. It does look amazing and once I saw the photo on my fridge I

286
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:26,720
became very jealous that I wasn't there. What were you guys drinking that day?

287
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:32,080
What were you drinking in that photo? Gatorade. I was drinking something called oh yeah it

288
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:37,600
was just Gatorade Andrew. Yeah. Don't worry about me man. Sex on the beach. You guys going to Margaritaville

289
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:41,360
drinking Gatorade? I think it was called sex on the beach. I think it would have been nicer for Christmas

290
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:45,080
especially they should have given you a photo of all the workers there. Yes.

291
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:45,920
- Yes.

292
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:46,740
- Not of yourself.

293
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:47,580
- Yeah.

294
00:11:47,580 --> 00:11:48,420
- It's so egotistical to have a picture of yourself.

295
00:11:48,420 --> 00:11:49,240
- I think it'd be really funny to have a place

296
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:50,880
that just has really aggressive names.

297
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:52,160
There's places I've seen that have like

298
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:53,120
aggressive cocktail names,

299
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:55,000
but it's just called like butt sex on the beach.

300
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,560
Like what the fuck, why do you just call it that?

301
00:11:57,560 --> 00:11:58,600
I don't wanna drink that.

302
00:11:58,600 --> 00:11:59,440
(laughing)

303
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:00,280
- What milk based drink named mother slut?

304
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:02,540
- Why is it that sex on the beach,

305
00:12:02,540 --> 00:12:04,760
it sounds so good, but butt sex on the beach?

306
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:05,600
(laughing)

307
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:06,440
- Wait, I can't figure it out.

308
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:07,260
Why is that?

309
00:12:07,260 --> 00:12:08,100
- Brown drink.

310
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:08,940
- Why is that?

311
00:12:08,940 --> 00:12:10,040
- What's wrong with it?

312
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:12,520
Maybe it's 'cause it does make me think of the sand

313
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:13,880
that would go in your butt.

314
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:14,720
- Could it be poop?

315
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:15,540
No, there's poop in butt. - You're thinking

316
00:12:15,540 --> 00:12:17,280
about sand mostly when you think about butt sex

317
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:18,120
on the beach.

318
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:18,940
- Sand in your pussy. - Sand is kind

319
00:12:18,940 --> 00:12:19,940
of your first thought.

320
00:12:19,940 --> 00:12:21,980
- Sand in yo hole.

321
00:12:21,980 --> 00:12:24,740
- Nasty fucking sex on the beach is my cocktail.

322
00:12:24,740 --> 00:12:26,420
- I'm a bit sick.

323
00:12:26,420 --> 00:12:29,740
Are you guys, I'm sick of when I go to a restaurant

324
00:12:29,740 --> 00:12:31,600
or a bar or something and they have a cuss word

325
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:32,440
on the menu.

326
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:34,100
- I don't need to see this shit, man.

327
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:36,820
- Do not show me swearing at a restaurant.

328
00:12:36,820 --> 00:12:38,860
- The best fucking wings ever.

329
00:12:38,860 --> 00:12:40,540
Shut up, man. - Yeah, what the chill?

330
00:12:40,540 --> 00:12:41,380
Chill on that. - And I don't care.

331
00:12:41,380 --> 00:12:43,980
And by the way, you're not fooling me with these little asterisks.

332
00:12:43,980 --> 00:12:44,900
No, I know.

333
00:12:44,900 --> 00:12:46,300
I know those are buttholes.

334
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:47,980
I know those are buttholes.

335
00:12:47,980 --> 00:12:49,940
It makes me not believe them, because why do you

336
00:12:49,940 --> 00:12:52,140
have to show off so much?

337
00:12:52,140 --> 00:12:52,640
Right?

338
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:55,100
Don't even tell me you have wings on the menu.

339
00:12:55,100 --> 00:12:57,260
Then I'll just intuit that you should have them,

340
00:12:57,260 --> 00:12:58,180
and then I'll try them.

341
00:12:58,180 --> 00:13:00,380
You know, restaurants don't serve you stuff in buckets anymore.

342
00:13:00,380 --> 00:13:01,100
Yes.

343
00:13:01,100 --> 00:13:01,600
Right?

344
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:02,180
What happened to the buckets?

345
00:13:02,180 --> 00:13:02,620
You get drinks.

346
00:13:02,620 --> 00:13:03,840
You can get beers in buckets.

347
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:06,340
Sometimes you get a whole bucket of food.

348
00:13:06,340 --> 00:13:08,540
There's a few places around here that you can still

349
00:13:08,540 --> 00:13:10,500
get beer in a bucket.

350
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:15,060
I feel like Branson lives off of maybe like a bowling alley food diet exclusively.

351
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:16,620
No, I've been getting better.

352
00:13:16,620 --> 00:13:21,220
You would think that he was like because he's a Missouri giant, but he cooks better than

353
00:13:21,220 --> 00:13:22,220
anyone I know.

354
00:13:22,220 --> 00:13:23,220
Really?

355
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:24,220
Besides like CJ, yeah.

356
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:25,220
Whoa.

357
00:13:25,220 --> 00:13:26,220
So you're making pasta?

358
00:13:26,220 --> 00:13:27,220
Duck a la ronge.

359
00:13:27,220 --> 00:13:28,220
Coq a vin?

360
00:13:28,220 --> 00:13:29,220
La ronge.

361
00:13:29,220 --> 00:13:30,220
I love coq a vin.

362
00:13:30,220 --> 00:13:31,220
Really?

363
00:13:31,220 --> 00:13:32,220
Coq a vin.

364
00:13:32,220 --> 00:13:33,220
Oh, I'm a big coq a vin guy.

365
00:13:33,220 --> 00:13:34,220
Whoa.

366
00:13:34,220 --> 00:13:35,220
Crimper Lays a lot.

367
00:13:35,220 --> 00:13:36,220
My wife hates it.

368
00:13:36,220 --> 00:13:37,220
What the hell is coq a vin?

369
00:13:37,220 --> 00:13:39,940
He got really into French omelets for a minute.

370
00:13:39,940 --> 00:13:59,660
a

371
00:13:59,660 --> 00:14:00,500
- Bread, wine, omelet.

372
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:01,380
- Omelet, yeah.

373
00:14:01,380 --> 00:14:03,740
- With beets and...

374
00:14:03,740 --> 00:14:04,580
(laughing)

375
00:14:04,580 --> 00:14:05,420
- You eat this every day in Paris.

376
00:14:05,420 --> 00:14:06,820
- Bread, wine, omelet, and beets,

377
00:14:06,820 --> 00:14:08,380
with a raspberry garnish.

378
00:14:08,380 --> 00:14:10,060
- Mm-hmm, and tuna salad right in the middle,

379
00:14:10,060 --> 00:14:12,420
and I wrap it up, put some fried rice on it,

380
00:14:12,420 --> 00:14:13,260
and then cut it down the middle,

381
00:14:13,260 --> 00:14:14,460
and a bunch of tuna spills out,

382
00:14:14,460 --> 00:14:15,300
and everybody goes, "What the fuck is this?"

383
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:16,140
- Ooh, that sounds so good.

384
00:14:16,140 --> 00:14:17,060
(laughing)

385
00:14:17,060 --> 00:14:19,180
- Tuna, fish, omu rice.

386
00:14:19,180 --> 00:14:21,300
That sounds amazing, man.

387
00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:22,900
- It's easy.

388
00:14:22,900 --> 00:14:25,300
- You guys think I should drink this soda?

389
00:14:25,300 --> 00:14:26,140
- Yes.

390
00:14:26,140 --> 00:14:27,460
- Buddy, that's not soda.

391
00:14:27,460 --> 00:14:28,300
- Do you want me to drink?

392
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:29,140
- No.

393
00:14:29,140 --> 00:14:32,700
- I don't want to drink this.

394
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:33,540
- Don't do it, man.

395
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:34,380
- You can tell how--

396
00:14:34,380 --> 00:14:36,220
- Oh, I don't want to drink this.

397
00:14:36,220 --> 00:14:37,900
- It's like 4 p.m.

398
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:40,300
- Yeah, you can tell how evil the Dickel White

399
00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:43,340
overproof whiskey is by the tiny, tiny amount

400
00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:44,180
that is left in it.

401
00:14:44,180 --> 00:14:45,340
Look how little is left in there

402
00:14:45,340 --> 00:14:47,380
that nobody has wanted to even touch.

403
00:14:47,380 --> 00:14:49,180
- That's what my wife does with chips

404
00:14:49,180 --> 00:14:50,680
when she doesn't want to throw away the bag

405
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:52,860
and she'll just eat until there's like three chips.

406
00:14:52,860 --> 00:14:54,620
There's just barely any left.

407
00:14:54,620 --> 00:14:55,660
- That's the whiskey crumbs.

408
00:14:55,660 --> 00:14:56,500
- Just throw it away.

409
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:58,940
Nobody's gonna make a drink of that little bit

410
00:14:58,940 --> 00:15:11,420
of

411
00:15:11,420 --> 00:15:19,660
a prank drink I think. You're supposed to mix it with like, yeah. Speaking of food, my wife

412
00:15:19,660 --> 00:15:24,220
yesterday ate a slice of pizza and she was in the other room, she ate the slice of pizza,

413
00:15:24,220 --> 00:15:29,460
she put her dirty dish on the counter. Get this, I walk out to the counter, I see the

414
00:15:29,460 --> 00:15:35,080
dish and I'm thinking this is gonna have a piece of crust on it because I saw something

415
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:40,820
on the dish. I get closer, it is literally she ate a circle around the entire slice of

416
00:15:40,820 --> 00:15:47,660
pizza ate the crust and left one piece of cheese pizza with pepperoni sitting on her plate.

417
00:15:47,660 --> 00:15:48,660
Not for you.

418
00:15:48,660 --> 00:15:50,140
That's not a saving it for you.

419
00:15:50,140 --> 00:15:51,140
I'm so sorry.

420
00:15:51,140 --> 00:15:53,940
That's like the reverse of what Charles did with the cheesecake.

421
00:15:53,940 --> 00:15:55,900
Isn't that the most psychotic thing you've ever heard?

422
00:15:55,900 --> 00:15:56,900
What did you do with the cheesecake?

423
00:15:56,900 --> 00:15:59,100
Man, I don't want to get into the cheesecake.

424
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:01,380
The cheesecake has already been litigated in the past.

425
00:16:01,380 --> 00:16:03,620
It's yeah, it was litigated.

426
00:16:03,620 --> 00:16:06,860
I was sitting there with the cheesecake, he eats the middle of the cheesecake.

427
00:16:06,860 --> 00:16:11,160
Well, no, you gotta explain why though. It's because it was a frozen cheesecake.

428
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:12,660
That's just some dick joke, Charles.

429
00:16:12,660 --> 00:16:15,160
No, no, no, you don't have to explain this.

430
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:18,160
I was recording, he walks in and goes "Mmm!"

431
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:22,160
He makes this fucking stupid Charles "Mmm!" sound like he's fucking Mr. Lou Berry.

432
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:24,160
Well, it looks good. Cheesecake tastes very good when you...

433
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:26,160
And then I can't say anything because I'm in the middle of recording.

434
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:28,160
He just starts eating the middle of the fucking cheesecake.

435
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:30,160
He goes for the middle of the cheesecake.

436
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:33,160
I wanted to check if it was still frozen. I was doing him a favor. He couldn't eat it because he was recording.

437
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:35,160
But I wanted to know if it was room temperature yet.

438
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:38,880
right in the middle the best spot to check if the temperature is usable you

439
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:43,320
will try to whistle your way out of anything yeah you have no dignity what

440
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:46,600
some people would say I ruined every single slice in a single bite but I

441
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:50,000
would say I was checking for my friend if the Charles also doesn't use pizza

442
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:54,160
crust doesn't use it unless it doesn't eat it this is good like Detroit style

443
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:58,240
pizza you got it you got to eat the pizza Chris

444
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:01,960
- How can it be bad, it is bread.

445
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:03,760
How can bread be bad?

446
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:04,600
- Okay, here's my thing.

447
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:06,000
If you had a really good pizza,

448
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,160
you were eating a really good pizza,

449
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:09,520
and you tell your friend you should try this pizza.

450
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:10,840
If they ate just the crust,

451
00:17:10,840 --> 00:17:12,440
would they have tried the pizza?

452
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:15,440
No, because crust does not constitute pizza.

453
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:16,520
- That's an insane argument, such a dumb motherfucker.

454
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:19,160
- No, if they tried a pepperoni, would it be?

455
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:21,920
No, it's part of it though.

456
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:22,760
- It's part of it.

457
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:24,680
- You can try a pizza without eating any of the crust.

458
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:25,520
- Dude, Caleb, you're not gonna win.

459
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:27,760
- If you don't get a pepperoni, I think you missed out.

460
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:29,400
- If you did a deconstructed pizza

461
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:31,320
and you ate every ingredient one at a time,

462
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:32,960
is that the pizza?

463
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:33,800
- That's actually-- - Whoa.

464
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:35,440
- Well, this is getting too philosophical.

465
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:36,800
- Yeah. - Holy shit.

466
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:38,280
- That just blew my mind real quick.

467
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:39,840
- I'm not gonna be able to sleep tonight, y'all.

468
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:42,680
- Yeah, I'm gonna be thinking about deconstructed pizza

469
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:43,520
all night. - The pizza.

470
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:45,280
- Patrick's already posting on Reddit right now.

471
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:47,400
Have you guys ever heard of deconstructed pizza?

472
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:51,080
- Yeah, it's a new hamster style pizza.

473
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:53,920
Deconstructed. (laughing)

474
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:55,480
- That's Nashua style.

475
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:57,520
- Yeah. - Still have not had the--

476
00:17:57,520 --> 00:18:00,840
Also real quick Charles, I I can't agree with you on this

477
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:06,120
But I do think that you're a piece of shit and you should be in prison for your entire life for taking this if you don't

478
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:07,000
eat

479
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:11,480
Pizza crust it's like not even half of them, right? You gotta eat some

480
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:18,960
40 slices and 20 crusts. You should not be letting pizza. Here's the great thing about America

481
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:22,020
You can do things that should put you in jail and you don't have to go to jail

482
00:18:22,020 --> 00:18:27,040
I think we can agree on that. Well, I don't agree with that. I think people who do illegal things should go to jail

483
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:31,400
Why I didn't do anything illegal, I just did things that people like Caleb think should

484
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:32,400
put me in jail.

485
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:34,120
You also bitch about tomatoes.

486
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:37,800
Well we can't, we don't know if you've done anything illegal until you see your day in

487
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:38,800
court.

488
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:40,800
He said shrimp isn't good, he said shrimp isn't that good.

489
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:41,800
Woah!

490
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:42,800
What the fuck?

491
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:43,800
Shrimp isn't that good.

492
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:45,480
Shut your mouth right now, you should be in prison.

493
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:46,480
This is disgusting.

494
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:47,480
This is some weird bug.

495
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:49,480
That's my number one food of all time.

496
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:50,480
Oh my god.

497
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:51,480
Yesterday, yesterday me and...

498
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:53,640
Charles, tell them what your favorite food is.

499
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:56,200
His favorite food is his Cheerios.

500
00:18:56,200 --> 00:19:00,240
His favorite food is Cheerios and eats them out of his hands like a baby.

501
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:01,240
They get stuck to his arm.

502
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:03,680
My favorite food is chicken tikka masala because it tastes so good.

503
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:05,720
That's not the answer he gave last time I asked.

504
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:06,720
What did he give?

505
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:07,720
He said his favorite food is water soup.

506
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:09,280
My favorite food is a sandwich.

507
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:10,280
A sandwich is what he said.

508
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:11,280
It's not bad.

509
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:12,960
I mean it's up there for sure.

510
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:16,960
A good sandwich is what he said to the question of what's your favorite food.

511
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:19,400
It's like basically saying like, "Hey Andrew, what's your favorite food?"

512
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:21,400
And I go, "Yummy, yummy food."

513
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:22,400
The delicious kind.

514
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:26,000
I prefer yummy food over non-yummy.

515
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:30,460
But it's not do you prefer good food or bad food, it's what's your favorite food.

516
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:34,300
And a food is what can fit on one plate.

517
00:19:34,300 --> 00:19:35,300
And it's gotta be specific.

518
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:36,720
A food has ingredients.

519
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:38,760
A sandwich does not.

520
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:39,760
What's your favorite ingredient?

521
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:41,660
A sandwich has ingredients.

522
00:19:41,660 --> 00:19:43,900
Do you eat the crust of your sandwich or no?

523
00:19:43,900 --> 00:19:44,900
I feel like you don't, right?

524
00:19:44,900 --> 00:19:45,900
Of course I eat the crust.

525
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:47,400
You eat them out of the middle and then leave the crust.

526
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:49,340
Let me say this about crust on pizza too.

527
00:19:49,340 --> 00:19:50,780
Here's another thing I gotta say about pizza.

528
00:19:50,780 --> 00:19:51,780
I know about that.

529
00:19:51,780 --> 00:19:53,860
The crust is the bones of the pizza.

530
00:19:53,860 --> 00:19:54,860
It's your fault.

531
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:56,060
eat a chicken bone.

532
00:19:56,060 --> 00:19:58,180
- Crust is not the bones and I've eaten chicken,

533
00:19:58,180 --> 00:19:59,860
parts of a chicken bone before.

534
00:19:59,860 --> 00:20:00,700
- I've eaten crust before.

535
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:03,300
- He's a crust before but I'm not proud of it.

536
00:20:03,300 --> 00:20:04,420
- The whole reason you eat pizza

537
00:20:04,420 --> 00:20:05,460
is because it doesn't have bones.

538
00:20:05,460 --> 00:20:06,300
- Everyone came up with that answer.

539
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:07,140
- That's why it's popular.

540
00:20:07,140 --> 00:20:09,100
- What I said, sometimes when you eat ribs,

541
00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:12,260
they're cooked so, they're cooked so much

542
00:20:12,260 --> 00:20:14,020
you can sometimes eat parts of the bone of ribs.

543
00:20:14,020 --> 00:20:16,620
- I eat parts of the bones of ribs too.

544
00:20:16,620 --> 00:20:18,420
- He just likes bones.

545
00:20:18,420 --> 00:20:19,240
- I clean the fuck out of ribs.

546
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:21,300
- I was gonna say, he just likes eating bones.

547
00:20:21,300 --> 00:20:22,860
- He's eating bones and this is okay.

548
00:20:22,860 --> 00:20:24,360
- Also bone marrow is delicious.

549
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:27,700
boner is a best foods of the world on their own just like it is she's on the

550
00:20:27,700 --> 00:20:29,420
inside of the crust

551
00:20:29,420 --> 00:20:31,940
who is the best she's on the pizza

552
00:20:31,940 --> 00:20:36,660
so i think i was not there's no now we're talking so it is like a lot of this

553
00:20:36,660 --> 00:20:40,100
was coming out here so it's not about the courage to say that you won't eat

554
00:20:40,100 --> 00:20:44,460
it would you really have a little bit if the crust had no bread and it was only

555
00:20:44,460 --> 00:20:47,260
at the end of the pizza just solid cheese

556
00:20:47,260 --> 00:20:49,780
would you eat that activity

557
00:20:49,780 --> 00:20:51,820
Yeah. Okay. So Detroit style is

558
00:20:51,820 --> 00:20:52,940
a style. You don't like

559
00:20:52,940 --> 00:20:53,580
bread. Got you.

560
00:20:53,580 --> 00:20:55,220
Well, the crust is kind of just

561
00:20:55,220 --> 00:20:56,220
like straight up.

562
00:20:56,220 --> 00:20:58,220
OK. Going out, you know, that's

563
00:20:58,220 --> 00:20:59,220
why it's.

564
00:20:59,220 --> 00:21:01,180
It's a well, you bite instead of a

565
00:21:01,180 --> 00:21:02,340
disgusting breadstick.

566
00:21:02,340 --> 00:21:04,020
You know, I grew up eating

567
00:21:04,020 --> 00:21:05,940
New England style Greek pizzas

568
00:21:05,940 --> 00:21:08,060
where the crust is like super fluffy

569
00:21:08,060 --> 00:21:09,460
and big. And then it's basically you

570
00:21:09,460 --> 00:21:11,140
get a big dipping stick at the end

571
00:21:11,140 --> 00:21:12,140
of the New England.

572
00:21:12,140 --> 00:21:14,020
You dip it into it.

573
00:21:14,020 --> 00:21:15,220
Yeah, you dip it into the sauce.

574
00:21:15,220 --> 00:21:16,540
It's a thing.

575
00:21:16,540 --> 00:21:18,060
New England, Greek pizza.

576
00:21:18,060 --> 00:21:19,300
It's a thing, but it's completely

577
00:21:19,300 --> 00:21:22,260
fake and it doesn't matter. It's not a fake thing. People from New England will tell you

578
00:21:22,260 --> 00:21:25,620
about it and they'll say, "Oh my God, the Greek style pizza is not fake." It's not a fake thing.

579
00:21:25,620 --> 00:21:29,860
The Greek style pizza is really good. It just sounds like it's Neapolitan pizza and they say

580
00:21:29,860 --> 00:21:36,020
it's Greek. No, it's literally normal pizza. It's normal pizza pretty much, but if you go to a place

581
00:21:36,020 --> 00:21:41,300
in New England that has... It's basically pizza that's flat. Yeah, Nashua. If you go to Nashua

582
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:43,940
and the place is called something house of pizza, that's going to be owned by Greeks. Yeah, it's

583
00:21:43,940 --> 00:21:45,940
It's house style pizza.

584
00:21:45,940 --> 00:21:46,440
Yeah.

585
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:47,440
It's not real.

586
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:50,440
It's basically pizza that's a circle and flat and they cut it into triangles.

587
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:52,440
So if you put it that type of pizza...

588
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:53,440
It's very fluffy.

589
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:54,440
It's very fluffy.

590
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:55,440
What's the funny thing about the crust?

591
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:57,440
The crust on the end is made of bread and fluffy.

592
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:59,940
I think cheeseburger pizza is very funny.

593
00:21:59,940 --> 00:22:02,440
My mom loves cheeseburger pizza and it's so gross.

594
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:04,440
They'd be putting that hot lettuce on that shit.

595
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:05,440
Yeah.

596
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:07,440
Put some cold lettuce on there.

597
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:13,440
Casey's General Store, the taco pizza was something that I saw ordered multiple times in Columbia, Missouri.

598
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:16,860
Missouri and that's just a pizza they put shredded lettuce and Doritos on.

599
00:22:16,860 --> 00:22:21,360
Well you have St. Louis pizza which is not even close to pizza. St. Louis is the worst kind of pizza that exists.

600
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:23,860
I love St. Louis pizza but I won't defend it.

601
00:22:23,860 --> 00:22:25,860
It is insane.

602
00:22:25,860 --> 00:22:27,860
It is insane.

603
00:22:27,860 --> 00:22:29,860
Did you guys ever go to Cici's pizza? Do you guys have that?

604
00:22:29,860 --> 00:22:31,860
Yeah.

605
00:22:31,860 --> 00:22:33,860
In college we would pay like four bucks for the buffet.

606
00:22:33,860 --> 00:22:40,860
Yeah I used to go and I would eat the artichoke dip pizza and I would ask them to make another one because I would eat so much of it.

607
00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:44,900
I had a buddy when he was my buddy would show up to that place when he was broke

608
00:22:44,900 --> 00:22:48,740
with big ziplocks and he'd pay for the buffet then just fill ziplocks for the

609
00:22:48,740 --> 00:22:53,940
week. Oh yeah. And then leave. This just looks like Domino's Thin Crust this

610
00:22:53,940 --> 00:22:58,100
St. Louis style pizza. It's got a different cheese. It's the cheese that tastes like revolting.

611
00:22:58,100 --> 00:23:04,220
It's Provel cheese which is a processed cheese made to have the lowest melt

612
00:23:04,220 --> 00:23:06,220
point possible

613
00:23:06,220 --> 00:23:11,620
So you cook it in like and and they cut it into squares

614
00:23:11,620 --> 00:23:19,500
They cut it into yeah, like squares like Chicago Tavern style. I love Chicago Tavern style. It's better than looking like yeah dominoes thin crust

615
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:31,180
Gotta say I think my least favorite style of pizza would probably be pu poop style pizza from

616
00:23:31,180 --> 00:23:33,380
pizza

617
00:23:33,380 --> 00:23:35,780
- Indian poop style pizza from the bathroom.

618
00:23:35,780 --> 00:23:36,620
- It's in the acquired taste.

619
00:23:36,620 --> 00:23:37,860
- Invite us on your podcast,

620
00:23:37,860 --> 00:23:39,340
you can start talking about eating poop, man.

621
00:23:39,340 --> 00:23:40,340
Come on, man.

622
00:23:40,340 --> 00:23:42,400
- I'm not talking about, I'm talking about not eating poop.

623
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:43,240
You're the one bringing eating it into it.

624
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:44,400
- How are you guys still on the air

625
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:46,340
when you talk about poop so much?

626
00:23:46,340 --> 00:23:47,180
- What'd you say?

627
00:23:47,180 --> 00:23:48,000
- Talking about--

628
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:48,840
- How are you still on the air

629
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:49,680
and all you do is talk about cheese?

630
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:50,500
- How are you still broadcasting?

631
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:51,340
- We're not on the air, man.

632
00:23:51,340 --> 00:23:52,180
We're underground, we're in the earth.

633
00:23:52,180 --> 00:23:53,000
- That's true.

634
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:53,840
- We're indie.

635
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:56,020
- If you search Prevail cheese on Google,

636
00:23:56,020 --> 00:23:58,420
the first thing that people also ask is,

637
00:23:58,420 --> 00:24:00,460
is Prevail legally cheese?

638
00:24:00,460 --> 00:24:01,980
(laughing)

639
00:24:01,980 --> 00:24:02,920
See, that's what I'm saying.

640
00:24:02,920 --> 00:24:04,120
It's not the answer is.

641
00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:06,240
It's oh my God.

642
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:07,340
Charles, Charles, if I eat the

643
00:24:07,340 --> 00:24:08,660
crust, they put prevail on it.

644
00:24:08,660 --> 00:24:10,820
You know, put stuff in it to

645
00:24:10,820 --> 00:24:13,380
to get it good, to get it more good.

646
00:24:13,380 --> 00:24:14,880
Trying to think of disgusting

647
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:16,420
regional food that we have back in

648
00:24:16,420 --> 00:24:17,820
North Korea. Oh, dude, in New

649
00:24:17,820 --> 00:24:19,300
England, they got the the chop

650
00:24:19,300 --> 00:24:20,300
suey sandwich.

651
00:24:20,300 --> 00:24:21,820
Oh, yeah, that is fucking that's

652
00:24:21,820 --> 00:24:23,780
fine. That is I never knew

653
00:24:23,780 --> 00:24:24,980
what that was because it's like

654
00:24:24,980 --> 00:24:25,980
silly thing.

655
00:24:25,980 --> 00:24:27,380
That's like a North Shore thing.

656
00:24:27,380 --> 00:24:29,260
But like I didn't fucking I never

657
00:24:29,260 --> 00:24:30,700
encountered it until

658
00:24:31,260 --> 00:24:32,260
I only ever heard about it.

659
00:24:32,260 --> 00:24:33,820
They shot cabbage on a sandwich?

660
00:24:33,820 --> 00:24:34,820
Yeah.

661
00:24:34,820 --> 00:24:35,820
Yeah, dude.

662
00:24:35,820 --> 00:24:41,620
In Sedalia, Missouri, they put peanut butter on a cheeseburger and called it a goober burger.

663
00:24:41,620 --> 00:24:42,620
Oh yeah, I've seen that.

664
00:24:42,620 --> 00:24:43,620
I've seen that done.

665
00:24:43,620 --> 00:24:49,620
Peanut butter burger, peanut butter hot dog, peanut butter banana hot dog, I've seen.

666
00:24:49,620 --> 00:24:55,020
You know, in Miami, they put peanut butter in a fruit and sell it for $127.

667
00:24:55,020 --> 00:24:56,020
I've heard that.

668
00:24:56,020 --> 00:24:57,020
Peanut butter fruit, and it tastes like PB&J.

669
00:24:57,020 --> 00:24:58,020
Wait, wait, wait.

670
00:24:58,020 --> 00:24:59,020
Are you talking about Miami Fruit?

671
00:24:59,020 --> 00:25:00,020
Miami Fruit.

672
00:25:00,020 --> 00:25:02,700
- MiamiFruit.com which redirects to MiamiFruit.org.

673
00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:04,660
- Miami Fruit is like my go-to.

674
00:25:04,660 --> 00:25:05,500
- Yeah, that's where I'm getting all my fruit.

675
00:25:05,500 --> 00:25:07,460
- MiamiFruit.com is the best.

676
00:25:07,460 --> 00:25:08,300
It's where I get my shit.

677
00:25:08,300 --> 00:25:10,140
- I'm getting the banana variety box.

678
00:25:10,140 --> 00:25:13,740
I get the Gak fruit that is $92 and has no flavor.

679
00:25:13,740 --> 00:25:14,980
I get the ice cream bean.

680
00:25:14,980 --> 00:25:17,300
- I do all my grocery shopping on there.

681
00:25:17,300 --> 00:25:19,180
- And my clothing shopping as well.

682
00:25:19,180 --> 00:25:21,140
- My clothing, I'm supposed to get,

683
00:25:21,140 --> 00:25:22,760
I started about two and a half years ago.

684
00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:26,260
First set of groceries should be coming in about six months.

685
00:25:26,260 --> 00:25:27,540
I really, really like it.

686
00:25:27,540 --> 00:25:28,380
The price is--

687
00:25:28,380 --> 00:25:30,220
- It's pretty cheap too, yeah.

688
00:25:30,220 --> 00:25:32,820
- I can't wait to eat a big piece of exotic fruit,

689
00:25:32,820 --> 00:25:35,060
get a huge headache and have to throw up.

690
00:25:35,060 --> 00:25:37,400
Three years for it.

691
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:39,900
- I was about to say that it's nice to shop

692
00:25:39,900 --> 00:25:42,380
from miamifruit.com 'cause they have a variety box

693
00:25:42,380 --> 00:25:45,660
and most grocery stores don't have variety boxes of fruit,

694
00:25:45,660 --> 00:25:48,100
but I just remembered that the grocery store near my house

695
00:25:48,100 --> 00:25:51,500
has a variety box of fruit called Box of Fruitopia

696
00:25:51,500 --> 00:25:54,480
and it's just a cardboard box that has six apples in it.

697
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:58,300
- Yeah, it was mostly, it's advertised as a variety pack

698
00:25:58,300 --> 00:26:02,140
fruit they have nothing but apples in it. Are they different kinds of apples though? No,

699
00:26:02,140 --> 00:26:07,660
the box has pictures of different fruits on it and then they all of them just have apples in them.

700
00:26:07,660 --> 00:26:13,580
It's like a mix and match six pack. You know the mix and match six packs that you can buy

701
00:26:13,580 --> 00:26:17,900
for beer? Oh no, it is different types of apples actually. Oh it is? This one at least was.

702
00:26:17,900 --> 00:26:22,940
Yeah but look at all the fruits. Yeah look at the picture. Look at all the fruits on the

703
00:26:22,940 --> 00:26:23,940
- That's from the Fruitopia, dude.

704
00:26:23,940 --> 00:26:25,780
They got oranges. - It's a chronicopia.

705
00:26:25,780 --> 00:26:27,340
- What do they got, pomegranate on there?

706
00:26:27,340 --> 00:26:29,300
But that's all apples.

707
00:26:29,300 --> 00:26:30,300
It's just apples, man.

708
00:26:30,300 --> 00:26:32,540
- That one in the middle could be a pomegranate

709
00:26:32,540 --> 00:26:33,660
in the middle, look at that.

710
00:26:33,660 --> 00:26:34,500
- Yeah.

711
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:36,060
- It looks like it could be a red delicious though.

712
00:26:36,060 --> 00:26:38,460
- Oh no, that is a pomegranate, guys.

713
00:26:38,460 --> 00:26:39,300
- Wait, it is?

714
00:26:39,300 --> 00:26:40,860
- I thought I spotted that, see that?

715
00:26:40,860 --> 00:26:41,700
- Oh my God.

716
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:43,060
- You got fruit vision.

717
00:26:43,060 --> 00:26:44,780
- We got the fruit master right here.

718
00:26:44,780 --> 00:26:47,300
- I think Cameron knows someone's storing an apology.

719
00:26:47,300 --> 00:26:48,140
- Yeah.

720
00:26:48,140 --> 00:26:48,960
- Takes one or no one.

721
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:49,940
- All right, I'm gonna go and buy

722
00:26:49,940 --> 00:26:51,460
the box of Fruitopia right now.

723
00:26:51,460 --> 00:26:52,300
I feel so bad.

724
00:26:52,300 --> 00:26:54,620
thought it was just eight apples. It turns out it's eight apples and one

725
00:26:54,620 --> 00:26:57,900
pomegranate. What's your go-to? I think Honey Crisp are real good and Fiji.

726
00:26:57,900 --> 00:27:02,380
Those are real good. Honey Crisp is amazing. I fuck with those. I like any of the very hard ones.

727
00:27:02,380 --> 00:27:06,260
Yeah, when you bite into it, but then it's all juicy on the inside.

728
00:27:06,260 --> 00:27:10,300
That's the crispy ones. That's what I like. I hate that. When I could eat apples.

729
00:27:10,300 --> 00:27:14,500
Granny Smith is good because it's like the Sour Patch Kids of apples.

730
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:17,380
I like a Granny Smith. It's amazing with peanut butter. I'm looking on

731
00:27:17,380 --> 00:27:22,920
Miami fruit dot com and they sell recipe books and one of them is smoothie inspo

732
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:28,200
and just imagine ordering $800 worth of fruit and then putting it into a

733
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:36,340
fucking smoothie. Oh this Gak fruit sucks I better blend it. Yeah maybe I maybe it's

734
00:27:36,340 --> 00:27:40,960
just a texturizer for smoothies maybe that's the whole. Hey baby you want to try this the

735
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:45,640
smoothie what is it just try it it's like durian and like mint and kiwi yeah

736
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:46,480
- Come on.

737
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:48,740
- I wanna try durian so badly, man.

738
00:27:48,740 --> 00:27:51,440
- I get, yeah, just, I mentioned the Gakfruit before.

739
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:53,120
I just want everybody who's listening to know

740
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:56,520
the Gakfruit is called a Gakfruit, G-A-C fruit.

741
00:27:56,520 --> 00:28:00,120
It costs $97 for one Gakfruit, which fits in your hand.

742
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:01,480
It's a spiky orange fruit,

743
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:03,680
and the inside looks like an animal's lung.

744
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:06,380
And it says on the page, flavor profile,

745
00:28:06,380 --> 00:28:08,800
Gakfruit has little to no flavor.

746
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:10,800
But you're paying $97 for a--

747
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:11,640
- It's the ultimate flex, though.

748
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:14,040
- The ugliest, the ultimate flex, yeah.

749
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:15,960
They're making new fruits.

750
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:17,160
That shit's from Monster Hunter.

751
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:17,880
That's not real.

752
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:19,080
That's not a real fruit.

753
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:22,360
And it's only been harvested between November and January.

754
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:23,280
It's a Christmas fruit.

755
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:28,680
You guys, we're getting all hung up on all the fruits and stuff.

756
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:32,840
You guys, they have a news section on Miami fruit.

757
00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:34,800
That's where I get all my fruit news.

758
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:35,880
Yeah, it's all fruit news.

759
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:38,240
I thought that they were going to have articles and stuff.

760
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:39,240
Do they have a picture of you?

761
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:41,000
Dude, Miami fruit's getting too political.

762
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,880
What the hell?

763
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:46,320
Yeah, see, "Eggfruit is in season" is one article, and then the next article is...

764
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:47,320
Eggfruit?!

765
00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:49,520
"Is Donald Trump fit to be president?"

766
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:53,520
Eggfruit is another one that has little to no flavor according to their website, and

767
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:55,760
just says it has the texture of eating an egg.

768
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:58,800
I mean, it's the fruit of an eggplant.

769
00:28:58,800 --> 00:28:59,800
I wish that it had flavor.

770
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:02,720
Do you guys know that black sapote season has arrived?

771
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:03,720
That's huge.

772
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:04,720
Wow.

773
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:05,720
I heard about that.

774
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:07,800
Oh, I just clicked on the same page as you, Charles.

775
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:08,800
How many do you guys want me to put you down for?

776
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:09,800
Fresh rambutan for sale?

777
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:10,800
A lot.

778
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:11,800
16 to 20 pounds.

779
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:13,480
16 to 20 pounds, please.

780
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:14,320
- Yeah.

781
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:15,360
- Okay.

782
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:17,080
- I'm so scared of having too much fruit

783
00:29:17,080 --> 00:29:19,560
'cause you can't eat all that quickly enough.

784
00:29:19,560 --> 00:29:20,600
It's just gonna rot.

785
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:21,840
- Just blend it up.

786
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:22,800
- That's why you gotta buy the,

787
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:24,400
that's why you gotta pre-order the tree, man.

788
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:25,600
Then you don't have to worry about it.

789
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:27,240
- Just trying to blow through all that fruit,

790
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:29,360
just having diarrhea every day.

791
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:33,800
- Amazing news, there was a banana bonanza.

792
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:35,680
- Really? - Back in 2017.

793
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:36,520
- Was it?

794
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:37,340
You're kidding me.

795
00:29:37,340 --> 00:29:38,440
- That's unbelievable.

796
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:41,560
- That's the greatest news I've ever heard.

797
00:29:41,560 --> 00:29:45,060
- Isn't there a thing where bananas used to taste better?

798
00:29:45,060 --> 00:29:45,900
Like genetically?

799
00:29:45,900 --> 00:29:47,680
- Yeah, well there used to be a different kind of banana.

800
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:49,240
- Kind of banana, right, right.

801
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:50,520
- There used to be a different kind of banana.

802
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:52,600
- It's like Brussels sprouts used to be like a joke

803
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:53,440
where they tasted bad.

804
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:54,260
- Which one is it?

805
00:29:54,260 --> 00:29:55,560
- And then the Dutch guys, those Dutch scientists

806
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:57,720
changed them genetically so now they taste good.

807
00:29:57,720 --> 00:29:58,760
- Yeah, I was gonna bring that up.

808
00:29:58,760 --> 00:29:59,880
I was gonna try to homeschool you

809
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:00,980
before you could homeschool us,

810
00:30:00,980 --> 00:30:03,000
but I lost to the master here.

811
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,880
- I'm on miamifruit.zendesk.com

812
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:08,440
where they keep all of their FAQ and the support tickets

813
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:09,760
if you have a tech issue.

814
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:11,400
And I'm on a page right now,

815
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:13,000
there's a Zendesk that's just called,

816
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,420
I don't like the fruit, can I get a refund?

817
00:30:15,420 --> 00:30:16,260
(laughs)

818
00:30:16,260 --> 00:30:18,480
And it just says no.

819
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:21,960
- Can you ask if they can make six T-Rex fruits for us?

820
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:23,440
- I'll submit a request right now.

821
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:26,160
- Do they make custom fruit for your request?

822
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:27,180
- Yeah.

823
00:30:27,180 --> 00:30:28,020
- Your email address.

824
00:30:28,020 --> 00:30:30,000
- Tell them you just got kicked out of a--

825
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:33,680
- Custom fruit description.

826
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:37,320
Can you please make a custom fruit

827
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:41,320
called the T-Rex fruit for me and my--

828
00:30:41,320 --> 00:30:43,820
Five male friends.

829
00:30:43,820 --> 00:30:48,820
We want the fruit to look cool and to taste like anybody?

830
00:30:48,820 --> 00:30:53,460
- It should be cinnamon.

831
00:30:53,460 --> 00:30:56,200
- It should be big cinnamon.

832
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:57,040
- Tastes like anybody.

833
00:30:57,040 --> 00:30:58,080
- Big and scary.

834
00:30:58,080 --> 00:30:59,000
- Tastes like T-Rex.

835
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:00,820
- Can you attach a photo of a dinosaur

836
00:31:00,820 --> 00:31:02,440
just so they know what we're talking about?

837
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:04,240
- They do actually do have an attachment section.

838
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:06,120
I'm gonna say we want the fruit to look cool

839
00:31:06,120 --> 00:31:08,060
and to taste like a dream come true.

840
00:31:08,060 --> 00:31:09,760
- Okay.

841
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:12,760
- The fruit will need to come--

842
00:31:12,760 --> 00:31:14,600
- Can I send you the dinosaur I want it to look like?

843
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:15,560
- Yeah, send it over.

844
00:31:15,560 --> 00:31:18,300
This fruit will need to come in sets of six.

845
00:31:18,300 --> 00:31:24,280
And the color of the fruit will be awesome.

846
00:31:24,280 --> 00:31:25,640
- Can they send it in a case?

847
00:31:25,640 --> 00:31:26,480
- Awesome.

848
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:28,680
- And six keys to open it so we can all open it together?

849
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:29,920
- Yes.

850
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:33,720
It needs to taste awesome with a blend of tropical.

851
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:37,640
- The season of the fruit will be summer.

852
00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:38,720
- That's what I want it to look like.

853
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:43,720

We'll put "love" at the end and put all of our names. Yeah, I will love you and we wear all your shirts year round.

Charles. I mean, it's his PFP and discord. It's been that forever.

863
00:32:40,560 --> 00:32:44,640
That's amazing. Oh, that's what that is. I see now.

864
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:48,760
I love that he's just in that parking lot, like outside of a stadium.

865
00:32:48,760 --> 00:32:52,880
He works the night shift at the airport. He's just like,

866
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:58,040
I've gone ahead and submitted our request guys. I'll let you know if we get a

867
00:32:58,040 --> 00:33:01,520
response. It'll take 24 years for us to get,

868
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:07,160
we're gonna be all men shivering when we get these first he rexford but it'll be

869
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:07,860
worth it

870
00:33:07,860 --> 00:33:12,680
it'll be so we're all going to take one bite and i i really i want to taste the

871
00:33:12,680 --> 00:33:16,680
orange meet cinnamon meets awesome flavor meets dream like a dream

872
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:22,680
oh yeah i haven't had in any exotic fruit but i definitely want to try

873
00:33:22,680 --> 00:33:27,480
durian but that's a stank they're really expensive man

874
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:31,720
yeah that's a fucking stink but i feel like it'd be funny to bring them to to

875
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:38,340
Movie theaters and stuff yeah, I mean you should just like walk in with a kit like a little bottle of liquid ass and spill it

876
00:33:38,340 --> 00:33:43,560
Just leave it in there. You could like probably get charged with terrorism for doing that bringing the

877
00:33:43,560 --> 00:33:48,600
Video about a durian yesterday that was called if you bring this to the hotel you will be asked to leave

878
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:50,520
whoa

879
00:33:50,520 --> 00:33:54,220
Got my durian videos about durians every day. I will yes

880
00:33:54,220 --> 00:33:59,000
Every day or 40 videos about durians. This is a thing that I think about a lot

881
00:33:59,520 --> 00:34:01,520
Apparently it tastes better if you eat it frozen

882
00:34:01,520 --> 00:34:08,840
So my just because you can't smell it. I'm eating I mean durian and stir strum on at the movie

883
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:11,500
Oh, that's the existing old fish fish

884
00:34:11,500 --> 00:34:17,080
I'm eating that I mean that ever in the in the movie theater. I'm watching salt burn

885
00:34:17,080 --> 00:34:23,120
Yo, we me and cam and Pat did smelling salts recently. Did you guys talk about this on the other day?

886
00:34:23,120 --> 00:34:26,660

888
00:34:35,540 --> 00:34:45,180
like a mummy where you go like if you get like if you get like a big can of

889
00:34:45,180 --> 00:34:49,500
like 100% ammonia it kind of does the same thing you just huff that why would

890
00:34:49,500 --> 00:34:52,820
they do that what it is a can of a hundred percent ammonia I mean

891
00:34:52,820 --> 00:34:57,060
Sometimes you have that around the house. We can put one right here to wake up

892
00:34:57,060 --> 00:35:04,620
Yeah, oh wait. We could put one next to this duffel bag that my dad. Let me show you what's in this duffel bag

893
00:35:04,620 --> 00:35:08,700
You already have one isn't that good enough for you? Yeah? I love what you guys haven't done with the place

894
00:35:08,700 --> 00:35:12,340

897
00:35:22,100 --> 00:35:28,540

898
00:35:28,540 --> 00:35:41,860
Fucking gumdrop ass life do you I know dude it's sure this kind of thing shows up at the office a giant bag of candy a

899
00:35:41,860 --> 00:35:46,660
Dump someone does someone just think so all one person always for Hawaiian punches in a duffel bag

900
00:35:46,660 --> 00:35:49,340
Like there were way more than four. That's four is that's the leftover

901
00:35:49,820 --> 00:35:54,780
Yeah, guys I'm sending you 400 feet of bubble issues hubba bubba chewing gum

902
00:35:54,780 --> 00:36:02,020
In the office for years somebody always one person buys something to make something to do something funny

903
00:36:02,020 --> 00:36:06,700
And then thinks that nobody will notice if they leave it inside a duffel bag in the middle of the floor for weeks

904
00:36:06,700 --> 00:36:11,340
And it works every time I leave that in an airport, and they think it's a bomb and everyone's freaking out

905
00:36:11,340 --> 00:36:17,380
They just find Hawaiian punch we had when we when we moved into this office. We got rid of

906
00:36:18,340 --> 00:36:21,340
probably two hundred and fifty toys.

907
00:36:21,340 --> 00:36:25,140
Literally toys. Not an exaggeration. We got rid of a doll house. More.

908
00:36:25,140 --> 00:36:29,740
More. Genuinely more than 250 toys. We had the toys for D&D. That sounds so fun.

909
00:36:29,740 --> 00:36:31,820
We still kept about a hundred.

910
00:36:31,820 --> 00:36:35,620
But we did have to get rid of quite a few, man. And we gave them away.

911
00:36:35,620 --> 00:36:40,120
My wife's calling me in the middle of the thing like, "Oh, the dog's freaking out."

912
00:36:40,120 --> 00:36:41,460
I'm at work, bitch!

913
00:36:41,460 --> 00:36:46,300

914
00:36:46,300 --> 00:36:48,300

00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:32,620
sitting on his wall since he moved in. Woah, what is that? Wait, you have one too Branson?

1026
00:42:32,620 --> 00:42:39,400
What is that? Gandalf staff. Woah! It's kind of the same thing. They do look similar. Branson,

1027
00:42:39,400 --> 00:42:40,400
You look amazing right now.

1028
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:41,400
Don't do magic to me.

1029
00:42:41,400 --> 00:42:43,440
You really do amazing, look amazing with that man.

1030
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:44,440
That is so awesome.

1031
00:42:44,440 --> 00:42:45,440
You need like a robe and stuff.

1032
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:46,440
My mother made me a wizard staff out of copper wire.

1033
00:42:46,440 --> 00:42:47,440
That is so amazing.

1034
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:48,440
That is badass man.

1035
00:42:48,440 --> 00:42:49,440
Oh my god.

1036
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:51,000
I want one of those.

1037
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:52,560
See I need more shit like this.

1038
00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:53,560
All I have is all this fucking.

1039
00:42:53,560 --> 00:42:58,240
Oh Patrick I sent Felix a Russian, a vintage Russian mason watch.

1040
00:42:58,240 --> 00:42:59,240
Anyone need some fungi?

1041
00:42:59,240 --> 00:43:00,240
Oh hell yeah.

1042
00:43:00,240 --> 00:43:06,800
I found the Freemasons, we were in Texas, we were like driving to I think LA or something.

1043
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:12,320
we went to this giant mall in Amarillo and there was a big knife store in there.

1044
00:43:12,320 --> 00:43:18,000
And I found the free, it's a blue pocket knife that just has the Freemasons on it with the

1045
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:19,000
logo.

1046
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:22,000
I thought that was in North Carolina.

1047
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,400
No, no, no.

1048
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:27,200
That's where I bought the Trump 2020 lighter.

1049
00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:32,440
If you're going through North Carolina, you're going to want one of these to play your guitar

1050
00:43:32,440 --> 00:43:33,440
down there in the south.

1051
00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:34,440
Oh yeah.

1052
00:43:34,440 --> 00:43:36,360
I'm in Nashville, North Carolina.

1053
00:43:36,360 --> 00:43:38,360
You gotta get a resonator too.

1054
00:43:38,360 --> 00:43:39,360
That's right.

1055
00:43:39,360 --> 00:43:40,360
I know about instruments.

1056
00:43:40,360 --> 00:43:42,760
Yeah, I'm trying to think of what I would-

1057
00:43:42,760 --> 00:43:45,280
You're gonna run into one of those indie rock bands down there, they're gonna want one of

1058
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:46,280
these damn ebos.

1059
00:43:46,280 --> 00:43:47,280
Whoa.

1060
00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:49,600
What the hell's an ebo?

1061
00:43:49,600 --> 00:43:53,240
You are in a musician's paradise right now.

1062
00:43:53,240 --> 00:43:55,360
Well, Charles lives in Guitar Center.

1063
00:43:55,360 --> 00:43:56,360
Yeah, that's right.

1064
00:43:56,360 --> 00:43:59,360
He did have a lot of guitars.

1065
00:43:59,360 --> 00:44:00,360
Got electrical tape?

1066
00:44:00,360 --> 00:44:02,800
What do you know about that?

1067
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:04,800
That's for electrical equipment.

1068
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:06,800
I have an alligator's head but I don't feel like getting it.

1069
00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:08,800
That's a lot of stuff.

1070
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:12,800
I had an alligator's head when I was a kid but bugs came out of it and made me throw it away.

1071
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:14,800
I have the studio right here.

1072
00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:16,800
This is not your house, bitch.

1073
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:18,800
This is not your fucking house.

1074
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:20,800
I could live here at some point.

1075
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:22,800
If everything goes wrong for me.

1076
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:24,800
If you crash sure enough it becomes your house.

1077
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:26,800
Are you planning on something going wrong?

1078
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:28,800
Something is going to happen very bad in my life.

1079
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:30,800
Can you tell us what?

1080
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:32,800
I wouldn't worry too much about the future in two days.

1081
00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:34,400
I wouldn't worry too much about the future.

1082
00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:37,880
In two days, there's gonna be, well,

1083
00:44:37,880 --> 00:44:40,040
me and a couple of my friends are gonna make a big splash.

1084
00:44:40,040 --> 00:44:41,220
- On January 6th?

1085
00:44:41,220 --> 00:44:43,200
- Why?

1086
00:44:43,200 --> 00:44:44,280
- When this comes out?

1087
00:44:44,280 --> 00:44:46,640
- It's going to be amazing.

1088
00:44:46,640 --> 00:44:49,320
- Oh my God, wait, this comes out on January 6th, guys.

1089
00:44:49,320 --> 00:44:50,160
- Oh, we should have planned something.

1090
00:44:50,160 --> 00:44:52,120
- Me and my friends are gonna finish

1091
00:44:52,120 --> 00:44:53,620
what we should have started.

1092
00:44:53,620 --> 00:44:55,800
- What you should have started?

1093
00:44:55,800 --> 00:44:57,640
What you should have but didn't start?

1094
00:44:57,640 --> 00:44:59,960
- Yeah, we couldn't start 'cause of something

1095
00:44:59,960 --> 00:45:00,800
that was happening this time.

1096
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:02,080
- 'Cause of woke, 'cause of woke.

1097
00:45:02,080 --> 00:45:04,720
We're going to start and finish what we haven't even thought about.

1098
00:45:04,720 --> 00:45:07,440
I think everyone's going to be a lot happier and everyone's going to thank us.

1099
00:45:07,440 --> 00:45:11,080
You guys are going to do a 24 hour movie festival, aren't you?

1100
00:45:11,080 --> 00:45:15,960
24 hour film festival. It's going to be awesome.

1101
00:45:15,960 --> 00:45:20,480
Almost anything gets so much more fucking awesome when you do it for 24 hours.

1102
00:45:20,480 --> 00:45:24,000
Francis, I finally acquired an actual film,

1103
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:27,520
35 millimeter Francis Ha.

1104
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:33,180
I call him Barbie Francis ha ha ha because I laugh at how bad it is.

1105
00:45:33,180 --> 00:45:34,820
His favorite film that he always watches.

1106
00:45:34,820 --> 00:45:36,820
Those little women, they're so fucking small.

1107
00:45:36,820 --> 00:45:37,820
Yeah dude.

1108
00:45:37,820 --> 00:45:38,820
You could pick them up.

1109
00:45:38,820 --> 00:45:40,980
She's pretty big man.

1110
00:45:40,980 --> 00:45:41,980
They're this big.

1111
00:45:41,980 --> 00:45:42,980
In the movie.

1112
00:45:42,980 --> 00:45:45,900
Listen, why did she make, why did she call it Barbie and not Little Women 2?

1113
00:45:45,900 --> 00:45:46,900
Yeah.

1114
00:45:46,900 --> 00:45:47,900
Oh shit.

1115
00:45:47,900 --> 00:45:48,900
It's true.

1116
00:45:48,900 --> 00:45:49,900
Well because the Barbies are this small.

1117
00:45:49,900 --> 00:45:50,900
They were the same size though.

1118
00:45:50,900 --> 00:45:51,900
They're normal size actually Andrew.

1119
00:45:51,900 --> 00:45:52,900
I didn't see it.

1120
00:45:52,900 --> 00:45:53,900
I didn't see it.

1121
00:45:53,900 --> 00:45:54,900
Alright well.

1122
00:45:54,900 --> 00:45:55,900
Because of woke, it's woke.

1123
00:45:55,900 --> 00:45:56,900
I didn't watch that shit.

1124
00:45:56,900 --> 00:45:57,900
It's actually not that woke.

1125
00:45:57,900 --> 00:45:59,460
You'd think it was woke but I watched it.

1126
00:45:59,460 --> 00:46:04,420
actually not that woke. It's actually pretty anti-woke. Yeah, it's pretty much anti-woke.

1127
00:46:04,420 --> 00:46:09,540
I was gonna say Barbie 2 that I'm writing is gonna be very anti-woke. Oh really? I'm

1128
00:46:09,540 --> 00:46:14,300
interested. So what's gonna happen in Barbie 2? Barbie 2 is, well yeah, it's

1129
00:46:14,300 --> 00:46:18,100
about January 6th. Barbie's gonna go to the insurrection. She's a big, like a

1130
00:46:18,100 --> 00:46:23,180
blonde Republican woman who does FaceApp too much, or Facetune. This sounds woke.

1131
00:46:23,180 --> 00:46:28,260
It sounds like it makes her really fucking woke. No, it's just I'm talking about the type of woman.

1132
00:46:28,260 --> 00:46:31,540
Yeah, yeah, she looks like a rescue hero type woman

1133
00:46:31,540 --> 00:46:38,180
Well, I'm getting there I'm just describing what the woman looks like

1134
00:46:38,180 --> 00:46:44,500
She's on the carnivore diet she has a great Dane named Piper who's like

1135
00:46:44,500 --> 00:46:47,500
Already died never

1136
00:46:47,500 --> 00:46:55,540
It's an XL bully mixed with a great Dane and it's one of the biggest scariest dogs in the world

1137
00:46:55,540 --> 00:46:57,540
I'm just named the West Korea bully

1138
00:46:57,540 --> 00:47:00,540
It's named West Korea.

1139
00:47:00,540 --> 00:47:06,880
And yeah, she's planning on going to January 6th and she sees like, you know, trans people

1140
00:47:06,880 --> 00:47:09,860
and goes like, "What the hell is that?"

1141
00:47:09,860 --> 00:47:11,380
And stuff, and like she goes around.

1142
00:47:11,380 --> 00:47:13,420
She sees trans people at January 6th?

1143
00:47:13,420 --> 00:47:15,180
Well, they're protesting.

1144
00:47:15,180 --> 00:47:16,180
They're counter-protesters.

1145
00:47:16,180 --> 00:47:17,180
Why are they there?

1146
00:47:17,180 --> 00:47:18,180
Oh, okay.

1147
00:47:18,180 --> 00:47:19,180
Yeah, there were counter-protests on November 6th.

1148
00:47:19,180 --> 00:47:20,180
The message of your movie is very muddled.

1149
00:47:20,180 --> 00:47:21,180
It's getting a little muddled.

1150
00:47:21,180 --> 00:47:25,740
were counter protests on a message of your movie is very muddled. It's getting a little

1151
00:47:25,740 --> 00:47:30,860
muddled. Barbie Toost begins with Barbie driving towards the Capitol and running over climate

1152
00:47:30,860 --> 00:47:36,220
protesters. Yeah. Yeah. She's mowing down. If you want to make Barbie too un-woke, just

1153
00:47:36,220 --> 00:47:43,620
a big protest for climate or gayness or whatever and just Barbie just unloading a rocket launcher

1154
00:47:43,620 --> 00:47:48,060
directly into the crowd. And she says, it zooms in really close on her face and she

1155
00:47:48,060 --> 00:47:57,460
says fuck woke yes that's a good movie I'd watch awesome hi there guys guys guys

1158
00:48:08,020 --> 00:48:14,660
valued and appreciated we do not offer t-rex fruit at this time the best thing

1159
00:48:14,660 --> 00:48:19,300
to do would be to stay tuned to our newsletter on our website as we'll share

1160
00:48:19,300 --> 00:48:24,940
updates there if we begin to offer this fruit in the future.

1161
00:48:24,940 --> 00:48:28,940
Here's the thing, if it's on their website, then everyone else can see it.

1162
00:48:28,940 --> 00:48:33,940
They're saying it like T-Rex fruit is a real fruit. They're saying it like it's real but they just don't have it.

1163
00:48:33,940 --> 00:48:37,940
Yeah, that's a good point. T-Rex fruit could be real.

1164
00:48:37,940 --> 00:48:41,940
They probably just don't offer it at this time, but they might in the future.

1165
00:48:41,940 --> 00:48:44,740
Wait, but some-- OK, wait, wait, wait, wait.

1166
00:48:44,740 --> 00:48:48,220
I found a T-Rex fruit.

1167
00:48:48,220 --> 00:48:50,700
You guys, look at this.

1168
00:48:50,700 --> 00:48:53,760
Oh, wow.

1169
00:48:53,760 --> 00:48:54,940
Look at this one.

1170
00:48:54,940 --> 00:48:55,440
Whoa.

1171
00:48:55,440 --> 00:48:56,180
Oh, no.

1172
00:48:56,180 --> 00:48:57,060
Oh, my god.

1173
00:48:57,060 --> 00:48:58,940
Well, I think that's just a watermelon.

1174
00:48:58,940 --> 00:49:00,540
Yeah, it looks just like a watermelon.

1175
00:49:00,540 --> 00:49:01,620
Yeah, that's a watermelon.

1176
00:49:01,620 --> 00:49:02,420
It's real, though.

1177
00:49:02,420 --> 00:49:04,140
That's a watermelon shaped like a T-Rex,

1178
00:49:04,140 --> 00:49:05,020
with the one up top.

1179
00:49:05,020 --> 00:49:06,020
It says the T-Rex fruit is a mythical beast-type blocks

1180
00:49:06,020 --> 00:49:06,780
fruit.

1181
00:49:06,780 --> 00:49:09,220
I see blocks fruits.

1182
00:49:09,220 --> 00:49:10,980
OK, so here's what I'm thinking, man.

1183
00:49:10,980 --> 00:49:13,060
There must have been an email where someone asked,

1184
00:49:13,060 --> 00:49:14,900
can you invent an ice cream bean?

1185
00:49:14,900 --> 00:49:18,180
Can you invent a ice cream peanut butter bean?

1186
00:49:18,180 --> 00:49:20,340
We can't at this time, but stay tuned to the newsletter.

1187
00:49:20,340 --> 00:49:22,260
Oh wait, there's a T-Rex devil fruit?

1188
00:49:22,260 --> 00:49:24,020
Whoa.

1189
00:49:24,020 --> 00:49:26,140
Those are the two scariest things ever.

1190
00:49:26,140 --> 00:49:28,300
Model Tyrannosaurus Rex is the ancient,

1191
00:49:28,300 --> 00:49:29,860
so untitled by God.

1192
00:49:29,860 --> 00:49:32,060
Scariest shit I've ever heard of.

1193
00:49:32,060 --> 00:49:33,740
Charles should know this, he's the One Piece guy.

1194
00:49:33,740 --> 00:49:37,100
There's a devil fruit named, like called Model T-Rex.

1195
00:49:37,100 --> 00:49:38,820
Yeah, they call him the One Piece guy

1196
00:49:38,820 --> 00:49:39,660
'cause he's sure got one too.

1197
00:49:39,660 --> 00:49:41,660
Anything about that

1198
00:49:41,660 --> 00:49:53,180
What thing the microphone my weapon I don't really do violence I'm more kind of doing violence to fools on the on the microphone

1199
00:49:53,180 --> 00:49:57,220
Right Charles damn

1200
00:49:57,220 --> 00:50:02,740
You know crust acid and bitch

1201
00:50:06,780 --> 00:50:10,300
How you not gonna eat the crust of a cheese crusty

1202
00:50:10,300 --> 00:50:21,320
Let's be real here if I'm out and about at a pizza place

1203
00:50:21,320 --> 00:50:26,720
I'm gonna be shamed into eating about half the crust cuz it looks weird for a grown man to have like four pizza crust on

1204
00:50:26,720 --> 00:50:28,360
His plate you're right

1205
00:50:28,360 --> 00:50:32,940
So you admit it shamefully disgust well, it's shameful to eat crust, but society doesn't see it that way

1206
00:50:32,940 --> 00:50:37,140
So I have to conform to these fucked up backwards ass conservative ass societal values.

1207
00:50:37,140 --> 00:50:42,540
It's shameful to murder people, but society says to not murder people.

1208
00:50:42,540 --> 00:50:45,840
And if you were if you existed back in the Neolithic times,

1209
00:50:45,840 --> 00:50:49,140
they would cast you out of the community and you would be eaten by a panther

1210
00:50:49,140 --> 00:50:51,140
because you need to learn to think like the group.

1211
00:50:51,140 --> 00:50:53,940
Conformity is how you survive. It's part of human evolution.

1212
00:50:53,940 --> 00:50:56,640
And then there would never have been crust on pizza if I invented it.

1213
00:50:56,640 --> 00:50:57,740
So then it would be the best food ever.

1214
00:50:57,740 --> 00:51:00,540
And they only had crust back then. They didn't invent the pizza part yet.

1215
00:51:00,540 --> 00:51:02,140
It was just circles of crust.

1216
00:51:02,140 --> 00:51:04,180
They had the wheel, they said, let's make this out of bread.

1217
00:51:04,180 --> 00:51:06,380
They mostly had, they mostly had crust.

1218
00:51:06,380 --> 00:51:07,980
And the crust comes from the earth.

1219
00:51:07,980 --> 00:51:11,780
It comes from the grains and they smash them up so that you can bake it with water.

1220
00:51:11,780 --> 00:51:12,180
Exactly.

1221
00:51:12,180 --> 00:51:13,180
Crust comes from the earth.

1222
00:51:13,180 --> 00:51:14,580
Cheese does not come from the earth.

1223
00:51:14,580 --> 00:51:17,900
Have you guys ever noticed how crust is wheel shaped and cheese comes in a wheel

1224
00:51:17,900 --> 00:51:19,180
shape, but the sauce doesn't?

1225
00:51:19,180 --> 00:51:19,940
What's up with that?

1226
00:51:19,940 --> 00:51:21,940
Do you see the sauce in a wheel shape?

1227
00:51:21,940 --> 00:51:23,340
Tomato is wheel shaped.

1228
00:51:23,340 --> 00:51:23,660
Yeah.

1229
00:51:23,660 --> 00:51:24,340
Tomato is a wheel shape.

1230
00:51:24,340 --> 00:51:27,380
Tomato is a wheel shape and so is the tomato sauce can.

1231
00:51:27,380 --> 00:51:29,500
And pepperonis, pepperonis too.

1232
00:51:30,100 --> 00:51:32,420
It's so is the can that the tomato sauce is in.

1233
00:51:32,420 --> 00:51:34,480
- Will you guys let Caleb talk?

1234
00:51:34,480 --> 00:51:35,320
He's raising his hand.

1235
00:51:35,320 --> 00:51:36,160
- I just wanna make a point.

1236
00:51:36,160 --> 00:51:37,180
I'm not raising my hand.

1237
00:51:37,180 --> 00:51:38,980
Oh, you can't even see it, and I just dropped it.

1238
00:51:38,980 --> 00:51:39,900
Hold on.

1239
00:51:39,900 --> 00:51:43,020
Do you see this tiny little O-ring, Charles?

1240
00:51:43,020 --> 00:51:44,740
I wanna talk to you about food waste.

1241
00:51:44,740 --> 00:51:46,300
Do you see this?

1242
00:51:46,300 --> 00:51:47,140
- No, I don't.

1243
00:51:47,140 --> 00:51:48,340
- No, this-- - Now I see it.

1244
00:51:48,340 --> 00:51:51,740
- This is the size of a pizza in Africa,

1245
00:51:51,740 --> 00:51:56,020
and this can feed 30 families for 30 nights.

1246
00:51:56,020 --> 00:51:58,660
And you're throwing away probably 50 of these every--

1247
00:51:58,660 --> 00:51:59,500
- It's like a menorah of pizza.

1248
00:51:59,500 --> 00:52:03,980
crust every single time that you don't need my crust to them to Africa

1249
00:52:03,980 --> 00:52:08,940
To Africa

1250
00:52:08,940 --> 00:52:22,780
Caleb said that their kid there people starving africa. You said okay. I'll send them my shit

1251
00:52:22,780 --> 00:52:23,620
(laughter)

1252
00:52:23,620 --> 00:52:25,420
- Yeah, crust, crust, I meant crust.

1253
00:52:25,420 --> 00:52:27,260
- Imagine the crusty shit.

1254
00:52:27,260 --> 00:52:28,100
- For his life right now.

1255
00:52:28,100 --> 00:52:28,940
- The crusty shit.

1256
00:52:28,940 --> 00:52:31,540
- Not even the whole shit, just the crust of it.

1257
00:52:31,540 --> 00:52:33,580
- The pizza crust, you guys are so juvenile

1258
00:52:33,580 --> 00:52:34,940
and immature on this show.

1259
00:52:34,940 --> 00:52:37,860
- You want to insult a starving African child,

1260
00:52:37,860 --> 00:52:41,140
distended belly, who opens up the only thing they've ever,

1261
00:52:41,140 --> 00:52:43,220
only package of meal they've ever had, they open it up,

1262
00:52:43,220 --> 00:52:46,340
it's not only your shit, it's just part of it?

1263
00:52:46,340 --> 00:52:47,860
- They can tell it's scooped out.

1264
00:52:47,860 --> 00:52:50,180
- This is, I've been so misrepresented here.

1265
00:52:50,180 --> 00:52:52,060
- And also, like your shit's gonna be crazy

1266
00:52:52,060 --> 00:52:52,900
- Because you don't eat,

1267
00:52:52,900 --> 00:52:55,420
all you're eating is cheese and pepperonis,

1268
00:52:55,420 --> 00:52:56,580
your shit's gonna be all,

1269
00:52:56,580 --> 00:52:58,260
it's gonna be liquid when they get there.

1270
00:52:58,260 --> 00:52:59,380
- Exactly.

1271
00:52:59,380 --> 00:53:00,220
- Well, I'm eating the bread underneath.

1272
00:53:00,220 --> 00:53:01,380
- 'Cause I can tell by your face

1273
00:53:01,380 --> 00:53:02,220
that you are lactose intolerant.

1274
00:53:02,220 --> 00:53:03,980
- I'm eating the bread that's underneath the toppings.

1275
00:53:03,980 --> 00:53:04,820
I'm not just pulling the cheese off.

1276
00:53:04,820 --> 00:53:07,700
- You're just sending like a KolaGuard box to Africa

1277
00:53:07,700 --> 00:53:09,620
and they're just opening it up and going,

1278
00:53:09,620 --> 00:53:10,740
is this shit?

1279
00:53:10,740 --> 00:53:12,860
- Well, what did you guys do to help?

1280
00:53:12,860 --> 00:53:14,060
- I said, I said this was--

1281
00:53:14,060 --> 00:53:14,900
- That's true.

1282
00:53:14,900 --> 00:53:15,720
- I was born there.

1283
00:53:15,720 --> 00:53:16,560
- That's true, that's true.

1284
00:53:16,560 --> 00:53:18,380
I haven't done anything to help.

1285
00:53:18,380 --> 00:53:19,220
Not anything about it.

1286
00:53:19,220 --> 00:53:20,500
- Cameron was raised in--

1287
00:53:20,500 --> 00:53:24,260
I was raised in Africa. I was literally part of a warrior tribe.

1288
00:53:24,260 --> 00:53:27,540
Yeah. Which warrior tribe? I might know it.

1289
00:53:27,540 --> 00:53:30,660
The Cameron tribe. Have you ever worn any of their outfits?

1290
00:53:30,660 --> 00:53:33,820
Oh yeah. But not anymore. Not since I moved.

1291
00:53:33,820 --> 00:53:36,800
There's a lot of photos of him. Not since I moved when I was seven years old

1292
00:53:36,800 --> 00:53:40,300
to America. And he assimilated very well. A lot of people

1293
00:53:40,300 --> 00:53:42,820
can't even tell, but he still has that African accent.

1294
00:53:42,820 --> 00:53:46,900
And he still has that warrior mentality. Sometimes you've got to calm this guy down.

1295
00:53:46,900 --> 00:53:51,700
Oh, you have to. You have to remind him that there's no war.

1296
00:53:51,700 --> 00:53:55,140
Yeah. And he still throws spears around too as well.

1297
00:53:55,140 --> 00:53:58,260
Wait, is there no war? There's no war anymore.

1298
00:53:58,260 --> 00:54:02,340
Oh, thank God. Yeah, we're all done with that.

1299
00:54:02,340 --> 00:54:05,940
I mean, I'm sure. I'm reading right here on CNN,

1300
00:54:05,940 --> 00:54:09,460
war. We're all done with that. War's been outlawed.

1301
00:54:09,460 --> 00:54:12,820
Wow. War, somebody, I think it was. Why hasn't everybody done that before? I think it was

1302
00:54:12,820 --> 00:54:16,740
President Biden, but he did one of those 2024 in and out lists, and on

1303
00:54:16,740 --> 00:54:23,740
on the out was war. So now it's all gone. But you know what was in? Jelly shoes.

1304
00:54:23,740 --> 00:54:29,240
Jelly shoes. Oh those are comfortable. Yeah, jelly shoes are very much in for 20.

1305
00:54:29,240 --> 00:54:35,740
You wear jelly shoes all the time. Like Dr. Scholl's? No, no, no. Imagine never hearing of something and

1306
00:54:35,740 --> 00:54:39,740
someone says you wear it all the time. You wear those brown jelly shoes all the time.

1307
00:54:39,740 --> 00:54:44,740
Those are clogs, they're not made of jelly man. What is a jelly shoe? I don't know what a jelly shoe is.

1308
00:54:44,740 --> 00:54:48,540
It looks like a type of jelly. Yeah, it's a plastic type of jelly.

1309
00:54:48,540 --> 00:54:49,940
Plastic is jelly.

1310
00:54:49,940 --> 00:54:50,940
The metaphor he's saying and what he's saying.

1311
00:54:50,940 --> 00:54:56,220
Charles is talking about shipping people who's crusty poop and Brant's talking about eating jelly plastic.

1312
00:54:56,220 --> 00:54:57,340
No, let's talk about Charles.

1313
00:54:57,340 --> 00:54:59,140
Let's talk about Charles.

1314
00:54:59,140 --> 00:55:01,020
They talk about all this nasty stuff on here.

1315
00:55:01,020 --> 00:55:03,300
You're eating a peanut butter and plastic sandwich? Come on.

1316
00:55:03,300 --> 00:55:05,660
Nowadays, that's basically the only option.

1317
00:55:05,660 --> 00:55:06,940
Yeah, Mike.

1318
00:55:06,940 --> 00:55:07,940
Plastic isn't everything.

1319
00:55:07,940 --> 00:55:09,540
Can you ask Elizabeth or whatever if we can have a plastic fruit?

1320
00:55:09,540 --> 00:55:10,980
It's like in Crimes of the Future.

1321
00:55:10,980 --> 00:55:14,660
OK, I'll reply to the email right now and I'll say, OK, and what about plastic fruit?

1322
00:55:14,660 --> 00:55:17,940
- Yeah, plastic fruit because plastic is a type of,

1323
00:55:17,940 --> 00:55:20,340
and specify that plastic is a type of jelly.

1324
00:55:20,340 --> 00:55:21,180
- Yeah.

1325
00:55:21,180 --> 00:55:22,000
- Can you send the picture again too?

1326
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:23,020
- Also, plastic is so easy to make,

1327
00:55:23,020 --> 00:55:24,380
they could make it for us right now.

1328
00:55:24,380 --> 00:55:25,400
- Say, okay.

1329
00:55:25,400 --> 00:55:27,820
- Ask her if she has another email

1330
00:55:27,820 --> 00:55:29,900
where you can send her bigger files.

1331
00:55:29,900 --> 00:55:33,180
- Plastic fruit, and then I'll do two line breaks,

1332
00:55:33,180 --> 00:55:35,920
say plastic is a type of jelly.

1333
00:55:35,920 --> 00:55:38,780
- I need to send you a jelly video.

1334
00:55:38,780 --> 00:55:41,500
- Google tab, and I'm gonna go to Google Images,

1335
00:55:41,500 --> 00:55:44,300
and I'm gonna search plastic clip art.

1336
00:55:44,300 --> 00:55:45,600
- That's for a whale. - Franken-sum-fruit.

1337
00:55:45,600 --> 00:55:46,860
- You want a bubble berry.

1338
00:55:46,860 --> 00:55:48,660
- Franken-sum-fruit. - You guys, you guys,

1339
00:55:48,660 --> 00:55:53,660
I found a website called dudejellies.com

1340
00:55:53,660 --> 00:55:58,660
that has male jelly sandal.

1341
00:55:58,660 --> 00:55:59,980
Oh, wait a minute.

1342
00:55:59,980 --> 00:56:02,340
Oh, this is a website where you can just

1343
00:56:02,340 --> 00:56:04,100
dress up like the dude.

1344
00:56:04,100 --> 00:56:06,540
This is a website that gives you stuff

1345
00:56:06,540 --> 00:56:10,220
to dress up like the dude from Big Lebowski.

1346
00:56:10,220 --> 00:56:11,420
- That's a very specific niche.

1347
00:56:11,420 --> 00:56:13,560
- Charles, what was the exotic meat website

1348
00:56:13,560 --> 00:56:14,560
we were looking at.

1349
00:56:14,560 --> 00:56:15,680
- Oh fuck, what was that called?

1350
00:56:15,680 --> 00:56:17,680
Where they have, you can get one pound of lion meat

1351
00:56:17,680 --> 00:56:18,600
for like $20,000.

1352
00:56:18,600 --> 00:56:19,920
- Oh, here we go. - What?

1353
00:56:19,920 --> 00:56:21,120
- Whoa. - Here we go.

1354
00:56:21,120 --> 00:56:23,120
Exotic meat market.

1355
00:56:23,120 --> 00:56:23,960
- That's it. - Yeah, that's it.

1356
00:56:23,960 --> 00:56:25,600
- You guys are gonna go crazy with this.

1357
00:56:25,600 --> 00:56:27,400
I can't believe Branson dropped his bombshell

1358
00:56:27,400 --> 00:56:28,400
at the end of the episode.

1359
00:56:28,400 --> 00:56:29,600
- Yeah, I know.

1360
00:56:29,600 --> 00:56:30,420
- Oh, my bad.

1361
00:56:30,420 --> 00:56:31,680
I just remembered it. - We're close to the end.

1362
00:56:31,680 --> 00:56:32,600
- Holy crap. - Now we've got another

1363
00:56:32,600 --> 00:56:34,920
20 minutes. - Bluefoot chicken.

1364
00:56:34,920 --> 00:56:36,640
- Oh, goose meat.

1365
00:56:36,640 --> 00:56:37,920
- Bobcat meat. - With eggs.

1366
00:56:37,920 --> 00:56:41,120
- The site's not that good 'cause they don't have people.

1367
00:56:41,120 --> 00:56:43,200
- Yeah, they don't have people and they don't have swan

1368
00:56:43,200 --> 00:56:45,120
and I wanted to see if they had swan.

1369
00:56:45,120 --> 00:56:46,720
- They have muskrat.

1370
00:56:46,720 --> 00:56:48,360
- This is fucking awesome, man.

1371
00:56:48,360 --> 00:56:49,200
Silky chicken.

1372
00:56:49,200 --> 00:56:50,480
- This is unbelievable.

1373
00:56:50,480 --> 00:56:52,600
I like they have, okay, I'll read a selection here.

1374
00:56:52,600 --> 00:56:54,740
They got raccoon meat, rattlesnake meat,

1375
00:56:54,740 --> 00:56:56,960
reindeer meat, and salami pepperoni.

1376
00:56:56,960 --> 00:56:59,680
(laughing)

1377
00:56:59,680 --> 00:57:04,000
- Yeah, they just have normal steak and then they have yak.

1378
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:05,440
- Antelope meat.

1379
00:57:05,440 --> 00:57:08,480
- You can get a yak filet mignon.

1380
00:57:08,480 --> 00:57:09,320
- Ooh, you can eat a--

1381
00:57:09,320 --> 00:57:10,520
- If I don't cook it right, I'm gonna yak.

1382
00:57:10,520 --> 00:57:11,980
You can get donkey milk.

1383
00:57:11,980 --> 00:57:12,820
Lionfish.

1384
00:57:12,820 --> 00:57:14,140
Oh, you can get a shank of shark.

1385
00:57:14,140 --> 00:57:15,400
Shank of shark, really?

1386
00:57:15,400 --> 00:57:17,520
Donkey milk powder, 50 bucks.

1387
00:57:17,520 --> 00:57:19,880
Look at the picture on the shank of shark page.

1388
00:57:19,880 --> 00:57:20,720
Wow, you can get a lot of donkey milk.

1389
00:57:20,720 --> 00:57:23,720
You can get five pounds of otter stew meat for $249.

1390
00:57:23,720 --> 00:57:28,200
Shark meat is only $30 a pound.

1391
00:57:28,200 --> 00:57:29,040
Guys, you can get 20--

1392
00:57:29,040 --> 00:57:29,860
That's not bad.

1393
00:57:29,860 --> 00:57:31,260
Shark's pretty common though, right?

1394
00:57:31,260 --> 00:57:36,260
You can get 20 kilos of donkey milk powder for $7,999.

1395
00:57:36,260 --> 00:57:38,240
(laughing)

1396
00:57:38,240 --> 00:57:39,080
That's amazing.

1397
00:57:39,080 --> 00:57:39,920
(laughing)

1398
00:57:39,920 --> 00:57:42,480
- We split that six ways.

1399
00:57:42,480 --> 00:57:43,720
- Yeah, we split that six ways.

1400
00:57:43,720 --> 00:57:45,400
That's such a, oh my God.

1401
00:57:45,400 --> 00:57:48,760
- What if you ate caiman meat and you became a caiman?

1402
00:57:48,760 --> 00:57:49,960
- What's a caiman? - Oh my God.

1403
00:57:49,960 --> 00:57:51,160
- It's like a little alligator.

1404
00:57:51,160 --> 00:57:52,240
- They sell nutria meat.

1405
00:57:52,240 --> 00:57:53,800
Can you guys imagine eating a nutria?

1406
00:57:53,800 --> 00:57:55,160
Do you know what a nutria looks like?

1407
00:57:55,160 --> 00:57:56,920
- No. - They're swamp rats.

1408
00:57:56,920 --> 00:57:58,600
- No, it says, they're big old rats,

1409
00:57:58,600 --> 00:58:00,080
but here's what it says on the nutria page.

1410
00:58:00,080 --> 00:58:03,440
It says, "Nutria are not rats," in all capitals.

1411
00:58:03,440 --> 00:58:04,800
So you guys are wrong there.

1412
00:58:04,800 --> 00:58:05,640
But can you imagine eating one of these things?

1413
00:58:05,640 --> 00:58:07,200
- You get some rattlesnake bones

1414
00:58:07,200 --> 00:58:09,840
for rattlesnake bone broth.

1415
00:58:09,840 --> 00:58:12,320
- I think I will just, I think I'm not that hungry

1416
00:58:12,320 --> 00:58:14,240
and I'm just gonna go for a suckling pig

1417
00:58:14,240 --> 00:58:16,160
between 5.1 and seven pounds.

1418
00:58:16,160 --> 00:58:21,080
- Wait, 10 pounds of iguana heads is $150.

1419
00:58:21,080 --> 00:58:22,840
- Holy shit. - Oh yeah, they are.

1420
00:58:22,840 --> 00:58:25,560
- 10 pounds of the heads. - Look at this piece.

1421
00:58:25,560 --> 00:58:26,600
- I'm good on that.

1422
00:58:26,600 --> 00:58:30,080
- Skin on iguana heads ready to cook.

1423
00:58:30,080 --> 00:58:32,340
- I'm good on all that, I don't need that.

1424
00:58:32,340 --> 00:58:34,700
I'm just gonna eat a peacock heart.

1425
00:58:35,840 --> 00:58:38,840
- A whole groundhog costs $200.

1426
00:58:38,840 --> 00:58:42,240
- Bobcat smoked sausage for $30.

1427
00:58:42,240 --> 00:58:43,080
- What?

1428
00:58:43,080 --> 00:58:46,420
- Look at the picture for Silky Chicken in the chat.

1429
00:58:46,420 --> 00:58:47,860
Look at that chicken.

1430
00:58:47,860 --> 00:58:49,320
That's a blue chicken.

1431
00:58:49,320 --> 00:58:50,840
- Oh my God.

1432
00:58:50,840 --> 00:58:51,680
- That's stealth chicken.

1433
00:58:51,680 --> 00:58:54,460
- It's commonly used to brew tonic?

1434
00:58:54,460 --> 00:58:55,520
Is that what that says?

1435
00:58:55,520 --> 00:58:56,720
- Ew.

1436
00:58:56,720 --> 00:58:58,560
- I'm eating stealth chicken tonight.

1437
00:58:58,560 --> 00:59:00,520
- Exotic sausage of the month club.

1438
00:59:00,520 --> 00:59:02,880
You can join the exotic sausage of the month club.

1439
00:59:02,880 --> 00:59:05,360
January's rattlesnake and rabbit sausage.

1440
00:59:05,360 --> 00:59:10,560
I think the best thing to get somebody from this website, unless they...

1441
00:59:10,560 --> 00:59:12,800
Oh, wait a minute, no.

1442
00:59:12,800 --> 00:59:17,800
I was going to say the best thing to get is the gift certificate, but no, the best thing

1443
00:59:17,800 --> 00:59:22,640
to get is the exotic hot dog of the month club.

1444
00:59:22,640 --> 00:59:29,080
You guys, this month is venison hot dog, followed by bison hot dog, axis deer hot dog, elk hot

1445
00:59:29,080 --> 00:59:32,920
dog. Those are all llama hot dog, goat hot dog, alpaca hot dog,

00:59:32,920 --> 00:59:36,560
alligator hot dog, also antelope hot dog, beaver hot dog, camel

1447
00:59:36,560 --> 00:59:40,800
hot dog, and wild boar hot dog. Is the beaver in season? They

1448
00:59:40,800 --> 00:59:43,440
also have those are when they're in season for a whole section

1449
00:59:43,440 --> 00:59:48,480
for exotic meat for pets. Whoa, rabbit meat for pets. Oh, they

1450
00:59:48,480 --> 00:59:53,440
got halal ostrich meat for pets. Python meat. Boneless meat.

1451
00:59:53,440 --> 00:59:55,720
Isn't it? This is the most incredible website I've ever

1452
00:59:55,720 --> 01:00:00,220
seen in my life. Yeah, I mean, exotic meat market and Miami fruits dot org.

1453
01:00:00,220 --> 01:00:02,920
Both ends of the

1454
01:00:02,920 --> 01:00:05,120
of the hell else could you ever fucking need?

1455
01:00:05,120 --> 01:00:07,400
And you fill in the gaps of this little CVS trip.

1456
01:00:07,400 --> 01:00:09,720
All I need is a website now for crazy breads.

1457
01:00:09,720 --> 01:00:13,000
Yeah, exotic strange breads dot com.

1458
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:15,120
Not me. They're going to send me pizza crust.

1459
01:00:15,120 --> 01:00:16,800
Yeah, we got red bread. We got blue bread.

1460
01:00:16,800 --> 01:00:18,240
We got green bread. We got yellow bread.

1461
01:00:18,240 --> 01:00:20,400
We got blue bread. We got red bread. We got yellow bread.

1462
01:00:20,400 --> 01:00:22,920
I want to go to that bread.

1463
01:00:22,920 --> 01:00:26,520
That's all I want. I need a rice place with different colors, a bread place.

1464
01:00:26,520 --> 01:00:27,520
Chevron bread.

1465
01:00:27,520 --> 01:00:29,520
Yeah. Bingo. Hot bread kitchen.

1466
01:00:29,520 --> 01:00:32,520
Have you guys noticed that food isn't enough colors lately?

1467
01:00:32,520 --> 01:00:33,020
It's not.

1468
01:00:33,020 --> 01:00:33,520
Good point.

1469
01:00:33,520 --> 01:00:36,520
It's really not, except for Sour Patch Kids. The number one candy.

1470
01:00:36,520 --> 01:00:39,520
You're biased because it's on your screen and you have a hat of them.

1471
01:00:39,520 --> 01:00:42,520
Where's your hat? Why didn't you wear the Sour Patch Kids hat?

1472
01:00:42,520 --> 01:00:43,520
That's what GBB stands for.

1473
01:00:43,520 --> 01:00:47,520
If Cam really cared, he'd be eating Sour Patch watermelons and supporting Palestine.

1474
01:00:47,520 --> 01:00:48,520
That's real shit.

1475
01:00:48,520 --> 01:00:49,520
Damn.

1476
01:00:49,520 --> 01:00:51,520
That's real motherfucking shit.

1477
01:00:51,520 --> 01:00:55,520
Alright guys, Riffmas, another one in the bag.

1478
01:00:55,520 --> 01:00:57,020
We'll see you next year.

1479
01:00:57,020 --> 01:01:01,520
My dog, I think my dog has shit, diarrhea in his crate

1480
01:01:01,520 --> 01:01:05,020
in the last 10 minutes, so I think I have to go clean that up.

1481
01:01:05,020 --> 01:01:07,020
- That's huge. - So this is an amazing,

1482
01:01:07,020 --> 01:01:09,520
amazing end to the episode for me personally.

1483
01:01:09,520 --> 01:01:11,520
- Maybe you should get a better diet. - Thanks for sharing your toys.

1484
01:01:11,520 --> 01:01:13,020
- Just throw a towel on it. - Eat some exotic meat.

1485
01:01:13,020 --> 01:01:17,520
I gave him an exotic bone, which was a not a bone from an animal,

1486
01:01:17,520 --> 01:01:20,520
but instead a... I wasn't fucking my dog!

1487
01:01:20,520 --> 01:01:22,560
Come on dude, don't fuck your dog man.

1488
01:01:22,560 --> 01:01:23,560
No I wasn't.

1489
01:01:23,560 --> 01:01:24,560
Your dog's got diarrhea.

1490
01:01:24,560 --> 01:01:26,120
And your bone's not exotic.

1491
01:01:26,120 --> 01:01:29,200
It is, it's red.

1492
01:01:29,200 --> 01:01:31,520
Oh that's cool.

1493
01:01:31,520 --> 01:01:33,240
You would think it'd be white as snow.

1494
01:01:33,240 --> 01:01:34,280
It's red.

1495
01:01:34,280 --> 01:01:36,880
It's red like an animal's.

1496
01:01:36,880 --> 01:01:39,800
Thank you to the good people of E1.

1497
01:01:39,800 --> 01:01:40,800
Thanks for having us.

1498
01:01:40,800 --> 01:01:41,800
Except for Charles.

1499
01:01:41,800 --> 01:01:44,200
You're very very stupid.

1500
01:01:44,200 --> 01:01:45,200
You're very stupid.

1501
01:01:45,200 --> 01:01:46,200
Is this about the pizza?

1502
01:01:46,200 --> 01:01:48,180
Yeah, yeah yeah yeah yeah.

1503
01:01:48,180 --> 01:01:49,600
And you said shrimp was mid.

1504
01:01:49,600 --> 01:01:53,640
You said shrimp was and you said some crazy stuff about Africa as well that we're not okay

1505
01:01:53,640 --> 01:01:56,680
I said that you want to shit to Africa which is

1506
01:01:56,680 --> 01:02:02,840
Almost worse than say you don't like it's an act of literal terrorism. Yeah, I feel like I've been mister

1507
01:02:02,840 --> 01:02:07,460
I feel attacked and misrepresented, and this is the worst appearance on this show we ever made sounds like

1508
01:02:07,460 --> 01:02:10,560
His toys which was very nice

1509
01:02:10,560 --> 01:02:14,020
Okay, and wait just remember this before you go

1510
01:02:14,020 --> 01:02:19,160
This time for Africa fuck you Charles

1511
01:02:19,160 --> 01:02:26,540
1992. That would be a good year because you can get put in the

1512
01:02:26,540 --> 01:02:29,380
nines, but you wouldn't see these people have 1991. Oh, they

1513
01:02:29,380 --> 01:02:33,020
were patented in 1992. That's exactly what I said. 1992 would

1514
01:02:33,020 --> 01:02:37,160
be a good year. Yeah. Yeah. The 90s make sense. But this is

1515
01:02:37,160 --> 01:02:40,580
this is this is complicated. This is fussy like this is too

1516
01:02:40,580 --> 01:02:42,320
much going on. You know what? Here's my thing. I think the

1517
01:02:42,320 --> 01:02:45,700
night these these 1991 1992. Wait, they said they were

1518
01:02:45,700 --> 01:02:48,560
invented in 1992. This woman's wearing 1991. That woman is a

1519
01:02:48,560 --> 01:02:49,360
a time traveler. That's

1520
01:02:49,360 --> 01:02:51,760
I believe that that is

1521
01:02:51,760 --> 01:02:53,660
but here's what I'm saying. The

1522
01:02:53,660 --> 01:02:56,360
1991 1992 glasses have had to

1523
01:02:56,360 --> 01:02:57,660
have been invented by either a

1524
01:02:57,660 --> 01:02:59,160
time traveler or a schizophrenic

1525
01:02:59,160 --> 01:03:00,660
person because who looks at the

1526
01:03:00,660 --> 01:03:02,860
number 1992 and says, oh glasses.

1527
01:03:02,860 --> 01:03:04,860
Yeah, I want to make glad 2000.

1528
01:03:04,860 --> 01:03:06,960
You're like, oh glasses glasses

1529
01:03:06,960 --> 01:03:09,160
or handcuffs or bubble wrap

1530
01:03:09,160 --> 01:03:11,060
would be great to merge this off

1531
01:03:11,060 --> 01:03:13,960
of but a 1992 is a psycho number

1532
01:03:13,960 --> 01:03:15,260
to look at him. Look at this guy.

1533
01:03:15,260 --> 01:03:16,260
We're in the 1998.

1534
01:03:18,260 --> 01:03:21,060
That's Jerry Lewis right there.

1535
01:03:21,060 --> 01:03:22,160
That's Jerry Lewis.

1536
01:03:22,160 --> 01:03:22,960
But look at this.

1537
01:03:22,960 --> 01:03:24,460
This to 2024.

1538
01:03:24,460 --> 01:03:27,460
This is like when you like you're like, like, you know, somebody

1539
01:03:27,460 --> 01:03:31,160

1540
01:03:31,160 --> 01:03:32,460

1541
01:03:32,460 --> 01:03:33,160
One hours.

01:03:33,160 --> 01:03:36,260
Yeah, that dog is like, it's like, oh, yeah, this is my 34

1543
01:03:36,260 --> 01:03:37,160
year old dog.

1544
01:03:37,160 --> 01:03:38,860
Yeah, that's what these glasses are.

1545
01:03:38,860 --> 01:03:39,960
We got to put them down.

1546
01:03:39,960 --> 01:03:41,660
It's time to put them down until it's time for them to come

1547
01:03:41,660 --> 01:03:42,860
back to work in a feed.

1548
01:03:42,860 --> 01:03:46,260
We're going to feed the dog a Big Mac with the we're going to

1549
01:03:46,260 --> 01:03:49,760
feed these glasses of Big Mac and then they're gonna pass away.

1550
01:03:49,760 --> 01:03:51,060
Why is there liquid all over this?

1551
01:03:51,060 --> 01:03:52,060
Oh, don't worry about it.

1552
01:03:52,060 --> 01:03:53,660
What the fuck happened?

1553
01:03:53,660 --> 01:03:54,560
Nothing happened.

1554
01:03:54,560 --> 01:03:55,560
What did you guys do?

1555
01:03:55,560 --> 01:03:56,660
Come on, man.

1556
01:03:56,660 --> 01:03:57,960
It's disgusting.

1557
01:03:57,960 --> 01:03:59,260
Nothing bad happened.

1558
01:03:59,260 --> 01:04:04,760
And we're back with amazing Brandon Wardell from Los Angeles.

1559
01:04:04,760 --> 01:04:07,160
All the way from Los Angeles, California, man.

1560
01:04:07,160 --> 01:04:09,460
All the way from Los Angeles.

1561
01:04:09,460 --> 01:04:10,760
Holly, Holly, weird.

1562
01:04:10,760 --> 01:04:12,560
You hear a lot of this over there in Los Angeles, huh?

1563
01:04:14,960 --> 01:04:17,400
Yeah, we got Caleb on the soundboard today.

1564
01:04:17,400 --> 01:04:18,360
I'm on the soundboard.

1565
01:04:18,360 --> 01:04:19,360
I always do it loud and proud.

1566
01:04:19,360 --> 01:04:19,860
And if you're near the...

1567
01:04:19,860 --> 01:04:20,360
Oh my God.

1568
01:04:20,360 --> 01:04:20,860
Yep.

1569
01:04:20,860 --> 01:04:21,860

1570
01:04:21,860 --> 01:04:23,860
Oh no.

1571
01:04:23,860 --> 01:04:24,760
Let's see.

1572
01:04:24,760 --> 01:04:26,060
I got to turn this off.

1573
01:04:26,060 --> 01:04:27,060
No, this is...

1574
01:04:27,060 --> 01:04:29,160
Nothing bad happened.

1575
01:04:29,160 --> 01:04:30,060
Were you not here?

1576
01:04:30,060 --> 01:04:32,160
I was not here for whatever happened here.

1577
01:04:32,160 --> 01:04:33,060
Patrick, what happened?

1578
01:04:33,060 --> 01:04:33,560
I...

1579
01:04:33,560 --> 01:04:34,060
There...

1580
01:04:34,060 --> 01:04:34,560
Don't worry about it.

1581
01:04:34,560 --> 01:04:35,060
Who did it?

1582
01:04:35,060 --> 01:04:36,460
It was you did it, didn't you?

1583
01:04:36,460 --> 01:04:37,260
Patrick Spiller.

1584
01:04:37,260 --> 01:04:39,060
Could have been Caleb, the famous Spiller.

1585
01:04:39,060 --> 01:04:41,060
