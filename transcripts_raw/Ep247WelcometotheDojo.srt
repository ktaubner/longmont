1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
I

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:16,040
saw a bug and Tifa is back where what oh you're fucking don't even say it. Let

3
00:00:16,040 --> 00:00:21,020
me say it. I know I saw that it is very well. Okay, one year ago, a tech. Do

4
00:00:21,020 --> 00:00:23,960
you guys remember what happened? I remember bottle through the way I can

5
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:29,360
a low class cheapo bottle of beer, a hipster beer, a hipster beer, a hipster

6
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:34,840
beer, a Dutch piece of shit, some Dutchman, the flying Dutchman through a

7
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:40,120
Heineken, through my window, crash my window open, slam, millions of particles

8
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:42,760
of glass. If I'd been in that car, I probably would have my carotid artery

9
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:46,680
sliced up and down, tic-tac-toe. Do you think about that though? Maybe it's

10
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:51,120
not Antifa, maybe it's the flying Dutchman? I have considered every option.

11
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:56,480
Okay, an antifas like, but I thought I was safe. I put a bunch of coexist bumper

12
00:00:56,480 --> 00:01:01,060
stickers on my car, Bernie bumper stickers, the Bernie back yeah dog dog on

13
00:01:01,060 --> 00:01:02,020
bird on bird

14
00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:04,640
bird. What

15
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:11,080
said a baby on dog on bird dog, because they like because it's a revisions like

16
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:12,400
animals, but a dog

17
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:17,820
sticker on the back. It's my original sticker. You get a guy. We get a baby,

18
00:01:17,860 --> 00:01:21,380
sell the sticker is a pretty good idea. Baby is a bird, something like that

19
00:01:21,380 --> 00:01:22,740
baby bird, but

20
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:27,480
it didn't save me. They knew the make and the model and they knew the

21
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:30,680
license plate, which by the way our license plate also got stolen last year.

22
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:33,360
I remember that we have a new license plate, too. So where are these fuckers

23
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:37,240
even? How are you? I was in a GPS tracker breaking, but maybe maybe that's

24
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:39,720
why maybe they have their spreadsheet. They're like okay, here's all the law

25
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:43,480
abiding citizens that we have to harass and ruin their belongings today. Let's

26
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:46,840
see well. Oh, we haven't done this license plate yet. Let's do it. So true,

27
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,800
but I know they deal this one and make it a

28
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:55,440
like put it on a kill dozer and then get them in trouble. But honestly,

29
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:57,880
knowing them, they probably have a checklist where they do each license

30
00:01:57,880 --> 00:02:01,000
plate at least four to five times. That's true. They stole our license plate.

31
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,800
Now there's a but we get photos. We get all the time. That's what photos of a

32
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:09,160
gray Acura driving down the do you remember the highway number?

33
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:13,640
You know what actually happened? They did they they broke your window. They

34
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:16,240
checked off your license plate and they were like wait. I know how we can get

35
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:19,880
again. We'll just take the license plate fuckers, then we don't have that one

36
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:23,480
it's unchecked. So I wake up yesterday yeah, I'm getting poked in the face by

37
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:24,020
my wife

38
00:02:24,020 --> 00:02:28,520
poked directly in the face and the morning. It's the weirdest way to wake

39
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:32,120
somebody up first of all, so I'm already pissed as fuck. She says somebody

40
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:37,300
smashed the side view mirror off the car and I just said all right, I'm used to

41
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:41,640
it. This is how fucked up it is. I'm used to it at your car is such a piece

42
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:47,780
so now I have a pink hand mirror from Walgreens duct taped to the side of my

43
00:02:47,780 --> 00:02:51,840
car. It doesn't do anything. I can't see anything out of it. I have to lean. My

44
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:54,760
face has to be in the steering wheel to see the angle that I would normally see

45
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:58,040
with the side view mirror. It is great. You know what it is? My life's over.

46
00:02:58,040 --> 00:03:01,600
Have you considered using robotics so that the side mirror can be adjustable?

47
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:05,480
The hand mirror? Of course I considered robotics, but I barely know how to do

48
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:08,440
that. Yeah. Your car, though, is like,

49
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:14,620
like, maybe, maybe it keeps getting attacked. Maybe it keeps getting attacked

50
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:18,680
because the hood is being held in with zip ties. There's... That was the other

51
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:22,240
thing, they sabotaged it, trying to kill my wife on the highway. All over.

52
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:27,840
What happened? Some... They tried to kill my wife. How? They undid the latch

53
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:32,520
suspiciously a day after I was doing something with the hood of the car,

54
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:36,860
but they must have gone in after me and un get the latch and forgot to close it

55
00:03:36,860 --> 00:03:40,000
and then she's driving on the highway. One Hundred and Twenty Miles an hour,

56
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:45,940
the wind, the hood flies up, crashes the front window, explodes on her and her

57
00:03:45,940 --> 00:03:49,880
sister and my dog. Whoa Jesus, while they were driving down the highway,

58
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:52,680
they didn't call and then they had to call somebody and the girls are not

59
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:54,440
very good on the phone. No, no,

60
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:58,320
hey, what are you wearing? Yeah, so now I'm in a situation where I think that

61
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:01,640
she's cheating on me with some some, but she's just trying to make conversation

62
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:03,720
Exactly. She doesn't know any other way.

63
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:05,720
What's your favorite color?

64
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:07,720
Yeah, that kind of thing.

65
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:09,720
What's your favorite color of car?

66
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:11,720
No, then you shouldn't come fix this one.

67
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:13,720
But yeah, dude, I

68
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:15,720
just don't know if it's worth it

69
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:17,720
having a car for me.

70
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:19,720
It's getting so fucked every single which way, up and down.

71
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:21,720
You need to get a smart car, dude.

72
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:23,720
No one's touching a smart car.

73
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:25,720
That's not true.

74
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:27,720
People are going to pick up a smart car and carry it away.

75
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:29,720
Yeah, exactly. Go put it on top of a light pole

76
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:34,860
I think about it every time I see a smart car. I think I could put me in

77
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:38,560
like five other people could probably just take this and not even in a not

78
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:42,540
even a really strong yeah, just no, just five people yeah period and five

79
00:04:42,540 --> 00:04:47,340
any gender and just could be picking this car me. Yeah, I'm a fit in my

80
00:04:47,340 --> 00:04:50,780
living room. Yeah, that's what I'm saying. I did not even consider when

81
00:04:50,780 --> 00:04:54,740
you're when you're terrible. What is say your say your pickup truck gets stolen?

82
00:04:54,740 --> 00:04:58,900
There's only so many places a pickup truck can be a big parking space, a

83
00:04:58,940 --> 00:05:02,400
the field, a big parking space and parked on the line between two spaces.

84
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:05,900
That's where I would look for a smart car could be almost anywhere. Yeah,

85
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:09,800
they could put it in the bath, a public bathroom. Imagine a smart car right

86
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:13,640
there. It would fit easily. It would fit so easily. God, maybe that's why it's

87
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:18,240
so smart, so compact and I'm having an idea. What? Yeah, we should get a car.

88
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:21,840
I wanna get a car for the business. Can we get a car and keep it inside?

89
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:25,160
But I just don't want my car anymore. I wanna, I wanna get rid of it.

90
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:29,720
Yeah, this happens for scrap. This happens one week after one week after my

91
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:35,020
in laws say hey guys to all the kids and their significant others say hey guys,

92
00:05:35,020 --> 00:05:37,840
we're getting rid of our old car. Does any we're getting a new car? Does

93
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:40,060
anybody want this old car? And I said

94
00:05:40,060 --> 00:05:46,360
no, I don't want this car. I have a car already now. I want it and now and now

95
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:51,040
wait say that again. You say say it like so say you just say it again.

96
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,800
So they said, "Does anybody want this car? We're getting a new car. Does anybody want

97
00:05:55,800 --> 00:06:01,720
this old Honda CRV?" And I said, "You know what? I already have a car. I don't need it."

98
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:05,600
And then what happened? And then they smashed the mirror off the side of my car.

99
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:16,000
Is that a new addition? Why did you lie? That wouldn't even happen in the... That has nothing

100
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:21,060
I was Larry David worked. I wasn't like no. I don't want the car.

101
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:22,080
What's

102
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:28,720
it? I didn't say like him. It was that sign to your

103
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:34,600
I didn't say that at all damn. I just wanted to show it off. Yeah, there's

104
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:38,960
going to be an opportunity to there will be. He will do something kind of

105
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:44,200
rude and later. My older brother suggested the Wilhelm scream.

106
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:48,440
that's gay. That's gay. That's all right. Sorry, man,

107
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:53,480
not happening. It's not happening. I was looking like before before

108
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:56,880
before I felt I was trying to think of something new to add and I was going to

109
00:06:56,880 --> 00:07:00,600
add. I couldn't find a good one, but I was going to add epic fail. That'd be

110
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:03,880
good. I think that I'd like that, but the Wilhelm scream, the Wilhelm scream

111
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:07,560
is what's the what we do that when someone gets hurt. Yeah, I'm an ask

112
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:12,600
credit post flies out a window. What are we using that one? It'll it'll like

113
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:15,600
I could we need a sponge bob my leg. That's pretty. That's a good one.

114
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:18,340
That is a good one. That would be good. If somebody that's like a almost a

115
00:07:18,340 --> 00:07:21,960
strict level up on the yeah, that's the same thing, which is better thing.

116
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:25,600
My leg decimating my brother's suggestion, so fuck out of here.

117
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:30,280
Yeah, we can keep that one, but we would have my leg there. Yeah, if we

118
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:33,760
yeah, yeah, because we would have been like we insulted this guy so badly. He

119
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:35,080
hurt his leg. Yeah,

120
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:37,120
holy shit,

121
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:41,920
but besides that had an amazing week. Why is it departed again? Well, let's

122
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:46,260
talk about the elephant in the room. What the submarine everybody talking about

123
00:07:46,260 --> 00:07:50,360
is a submarine. You guys don't know the submarine. Oh yeah. Are you kidding me

124
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:54,660
buckle in? I know that once I get I'm going to get into this story too late,

125
00:07:54,660 --> 00:07:58,780
but like the people that I saw what in God's name are you on about? Okay, so

126
00:07:58,780 --> 00:08:03,720
basically kind of annoyed me. Okay, it annoyed him, so we can't do it. Can't do

127
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:07,980
it. Basically, there's this service where this is this has been the big news the

128
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,300
past the past few days, so we're definitely too late to it, but I but

129
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:15,040
it's I'm kind of obsessed with it right now. There's this the service where

130
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:19,240
they these rich people they pay to go down and look at the Titanic in a

131
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:23,440
homemade submarine. It's the service where these guys built a submarine and

132
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:27,920
they take people down to where is the Titanic crashed really, really far down

133
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:32,320
like far like you should not go down there. I mean I mean on a summer, I

134
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:37,400
don't know. I don't know. I don't care the ocean, the water in the

135
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:42,640
the Atlantic. It wasn't a lake. No, no, man, this time, but this you should see a

136
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:45,420
picture of this submarine. It's literally homemade. They've got parts of

137
00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:48,960
it from campers world. There's like a video of this guy talking about it. They

138
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:55,540
control the submarine with a knock off Xbox control. Okay, that's how they use

139
00:08:55,540 --> 00:08:57,200
it. They control it. This is cool. This is

140
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:01,940
twenty million leagues under the sea. This submarine is completely that's the

141
00:09:01,940 --> 00:09:06,680
controller. They use to control a shit. It's modded and it's lost right now. The

142
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:10,420
people are almost certainly dead. They've either blown up it's it's lost

143
00:09:10,420 --> 00:09:14,700
it's gone yeah. They can't find it. There's no somebody past cost two

144
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:18,300
hundred and fifty thousand dollars per person. Who are these people that

145
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:20,820
they're just rich people who like the Titanic

146
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:26,280
and they're gone. They're almost the most dead and there's like a bunch of

147
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:30,020
videos. I've been surfacing of like the past like year because they've been

148
00:09:30,020 --> 00:09:33,220
doing it for like a little while yeah, and this is like I guess not the first

149
00:09:33,220 --> 00:09:36,180
like there. There's a thing of some guy being like yeah. They took me on it. It

150
00:09:36,220 --> 00:09:39,740
it's pretty cool and then I was sitting on the and the boat like watching the

151
00:09:39,740 --> 00:09:43,060
control panel and then they they yeah they lost the submarine for five hours

152
00:09:43,060 --> 00:09:46,020
and they turned off all the wife on the boat. So we couldn't tweet about it.

153
00:09:46,020 --> 00:09:50,060
That happened like a year ago and I think it's always there's all these

154
00:09:50,060 --> 00:09:53,580
videos of the guys who invented it being like like yeah, there's no seats in

155
00:09:53,580 --> 00:09:55,980
here. There's just one window and check it out. This is what we used to control

156
00:09:55,980 --> 00:09:59,780
it isn't this cool and being like yeah. I got this part from like I mean yard. I

157
00:09:59,780 --> 00:10:02,700
hate it. I'm on the side of a small business. That's what I and that's what

158
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:05,460
I'm saying. Everybody's saying why would you ever get on this submarine?

159
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:09,600
everybody's saying this is this is insane. That she is so stupid, the

160
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:13,180
being obsessed with the Titanic, who gives up the touch? No, you're on

161
00:10:13,180 --> 00:10:16,600
your is completely right. This is the only problem. Here's the submarine

162
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:21,640
yeah, no, but what I was going to my point of is. Can you imagine you first

163
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:24,820
of all building a submarine that works at all enough to go down to the

164
00:10:24,820 --> 00:10:29,440
Titanic two point three miles under the ocean? Yeah, that's not to do any

165
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:32,880
amount of time any like you do it a bunch of time. Amazing you built it out

166
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:36,400
the parts that you bought it to try of of you're not a scientist. You went to the

167
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:39,080
store and you're like they're doing this handle looks good. I guess I'll buy

168
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:42,380
this handle. They're doing my summer named kids next door to buy for

169
00:10:42,380 --> 00:10:44,680
technology, a million dollars per trip.

170
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:50,920
Well wait, I think I just figured out where the titanic thing went for to go

171
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:54,700
the delightful children from down the lane. Oh yeah, they struck again. I

172
00:10:54,700 --> 00:10:57,780
think they definitely definitely took it out, but the inside of it. It has no

173
00:10:57,780 --> 00:11:01,200
seats. It has what it looks like it looks like it looks like that. Look up

174
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:05,080
it looks official man. Wait, you see the inside. Yeah, wait, go back up, go back

175
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:09,460
up that picture right there. There's no seats. It's just a tube. There's a

176
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:13,360
toilet set into the floor. Can you shit in it? You can shit in the toilet.

177
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:16,760
How they fucking died? Did they shoot the shit out and they died in the

178
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:21,720
submarine? They died because somebody crapped and they fucking smelled so bad

179
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:24,260
they destroyed the thing. Well, I don't know about you guys. When I get

180
00:11:24,260 --> 00:11:28,080
stressed out, I need to take a really stinky shit. Yeah, and I would be one. I

181
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:31,920
would be really stressed out if I was trapped under the ocean. Where are they

182
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:34,900
where they're leaving from? It's an impressive story outside. Where do they

183
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:38,480
leave from? Is it a- It's a boat. Oh, here's the other thing. No, like what,

184
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:42,120
like- Where do they port? Yeah, where do they port? I don't care, the ocean. You

185
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:44,320
keep saying, "I don't care." I'm just asking a question. I don't know. We're

186
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:47,840
trying to learn about this thing that you said you're completely obsessed with.

187
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:52,880
I don't- where did they- okay. Anyway, the cool thing that I was about to say

188
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:56,400
that's better than where they came from is that also you can't get out of the

189
00:11:56,420 --> 00:12:00,320
submarine from inside, you're bolted in and the only way to get out is if a

190
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:04,260
crew member if you come to the surface and they take they completely unbilled

191
00:12:04,260 --> 00:12:08,180
this. Whoa! So even if these people who are lost got to the surface, they would

192
00:12:08,180 --> 00:12:13,340
just suffocate inside of it. Oh man! Yeah! Yeah! So this is not the best

193
00:12:13,340 --> 00:12:19,660
this submarine. I'll say it sucks ass. It's crazy. Look at it. Look at the guy

194
00:12:19,660 --> 00:12:23,580
who's driving. He's not even driving. It's remote controlled, but he just sits

195
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:27,920
there. He looks out the window. Jesus Christ. I think it's cool, man. I think

196
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:31,680
it's so cool. I don't know. I feel like if you get in that thing, it's just just

197
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:34,960
like the Titanic. If you get in that thing, whatever happens to you, you

198
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:38,840
deserve it. Think about it. I mean, through the Titanic. Yeah. 100 and

199
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:42,160
something people. Actually, maybe it was more than that. How many people died in

200
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:45,720
the Titanic? It must have been more than 100, but I don't know. I think it was

201
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:50,600
big back then. I mean, the Titanic was quite large. Titanic was Titanic. How big

202
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:53,100
How high was it look up Titanic death count?

203
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:59,000
It must be it must be pretty high. I'm going to guess they made a whole

204
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:03,720
fucking. I would say I would say 500 is my my kind of say six hundred and

205
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:08,200
twenty three fifteen hundred people. Oh, and there were two thousand two

206
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:11,200
hundred forty on board more than fifteen hundred

207
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:15,800
oh fifteen hundred died. I guess I mean if you get on that fucking kind of

208
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:20,200
suspicious that exactly fifteen hundred died. Don't you think I think it's

209
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:21,240
inflated straight up?

210
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:25,440
Well, yeah, I mean there was that you know life was worth more back then

211
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:29,480
we're worth less back then. Actually, they had little kids going into

212
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:33,360
factories and shit and putting their fingers in machines. Life was worth more

213
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:36,920
because you live short, less people and you live shorter. No, it's worth less

214
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:40,480
because they didn't have like the phone or the computer or anything. Yeah, what

215
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:43,600
do you do like to do a basic hyper pop? Well, that's what I was thinking. Okay,

216
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:45,040
I watched The Departed the other day.

217
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:46,040
Uh-huh.

218
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:49,040
And you know the sex scene in The Departed?

219
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:50,040
Jubio, pull that up.

220
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:51,040
No.

221
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:55,040
The sex scene in The Departed, they start fucking and they play...

222
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:56,040
Comfortably numb.

223
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:57,040
Yeah, they play comfortably numb.

224
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:58,040
Yeah.

225
00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:01,440
And it's like, what, did, I just, did people used to fuck to like classic rock all the

226
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:02,440
time?

227
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:03,440
Yeah.

228
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:04,440
What do you talk, yeah.

229
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:05,440
That's awful, man.

230
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:06,440
They would have like the radio on.

231
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:07,440
They wouldn't be able to control what it is.

232
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:08,440
There is no pain, you are receding.

233
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:09,440
You're jeered at.

234
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:13,440
Honestly, I can't imagine fucking without Hyperpop being in that dick.

235
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:22,080
I need my play play Bill Withers or something. If you're going to put a

236
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:26,640
sex scene in a movie before they had Mario, I saw something I saw like

237
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:29,680
this video this dude like breaking down

238
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:31,600
what like

239
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:37,200
like hi fi audio equipment they had in movies and I guess Matthew Damon's

240
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:43,000
hi fi set. Matthew Damon so incredibly expensive. Oh yeah, the one that she

241
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:46,240
plugs her headphones in to listen to the CD.

242
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:51,400
I guess that thing is like, you know how like the audiophiles get all like insane about

243
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:55,600
like, "Oh, there's too much hiss on this."

244
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:57,960
I guess that is like...

245
00:14:57,960 --> 00:15:04,800
So that's like, I think it was like a $15,000 like hi-fi set or something.

246
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:05,800
And back then that was a lot of money.

247
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:07,080
It's basically chump change now.

248
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:10,760
That's how much I'll probably have to spend to replace my mirror at this point.

249
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:12,760
That movie is so good though, The Departed.

250
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:13,760
Yeah, Fie.

251
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:14,760
That's the best Scorsese movie.

252
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:15,760
One of the best.

253
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:16,760
Well, it's top three.

254
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:17,760
Yeah, Goodfellas is obviously his best.

255
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:19,760
I'm pretty excited for his new one.

256
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:20,760
Yeah.

257
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:21,760
What's the new one?

258
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:22,760
The Flower Moon.

259
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:24,760
The one about, did you see the trailer?

260
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:26,760
You should watch the trailer, it's really good.

261
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:27,760
Really?

262
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:28,760
Yeah.

263
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:29,760
Who's in that?

264
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:30,760
Everybody.

265
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:31,760
I'll watch anything he does.

266
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:32,760
Leonardo DiCaprio, Robert De Niro.

267
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:34,760
Scorsese, I'll watch anything he makes.

268
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:35,760
He's in the movie this time?

269
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:36,760
He's behind the camera.

270
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:37,760
Oh, well he's not in the movie then.

271
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:38,760
He's a rat.

272
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:42,120
we actually don't know yet, because all I've seen is a trailer. Yeah, very well

273
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:45,560
be in a movie there. That'd be cool to have like a cameo where he just walked

274
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:51,200
by in waves. That's what I'm not. Sean Malone does really basically yeah, yeah,

275
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:54,120
yeah, that's the twist. That's a real twist. There's always like a UPS

276
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:58,480
driver. He has the best cameos. Yeah, and signs they he's he plays the guy

277
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:01,880
who killed their mom in a drunk driving accident. He's a bad guy. Usually

278
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:03,240
they like an old that's

279
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:07,600
a director came. It's the best cameo ever, because it's they like they don't

280
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:10,860
tell you that that he's that guy yet, but you know that that guy exists or

281
00:16:10,860 --> 00:16:14,340
whatever, and basically the whole family like is walking by and they see him in a

282
00:16:14,340 --> 00:16:17,840
restaurant and they all just look at him and go. Is that him and I'm not sure I'm

283
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:18,780
a yeah point,

284
00:16:18,780 --> 00:16:24,600
and then you realize it's like they mean that he's a drunk driver, but it's

285
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:28,300
really good. Wow, I think I would do that if I was a director. It's so cool,

286
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:33,060
but I'd get I'd have he does he's as a slap shop commercial and the new his

287
00:16:33,060 --> 00:16:36,260
newest one. I would know shit. I would be with he's the slap chopper. He's

288
00:16:36,300 --> 00:16:39,700
Vince, he makes up a slap chop type commercial.

289
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:42,780
That was the craziest thing ever.

290
00:16:42,780 --> 00:16:47,180
We've talked about this before, but just like the slap chop guy, he slapped and chopped a

291
00:16:47,180 --> 00:16:48,380
woman with his mouth.

292
00:16:48,380 --> 00:16:49,980
He chomped.

293
00:16:49,980 --> 00:16:51,980
He did a slap chomp?

294
00:16:51,980 --> 00:16:52,980
Yeah.

295
00:16:52,980 --> 00:16:53,980
He bit.

296
00:16:53,980 --> 00:16:54,980
No, he got bit.

297
00:16:54,980 --> 00:16:57,500
Oh, well that's the complete opposite.

298
00:16:57,500 --> 00:16:59,980
Yeah, then he should be slapping and chomping her in defense.

299
00:16:59,980 --> 00:17:05,740
But it was like his story, the slap chop guy's story was that he was a failed comedian and

300
00:17:05,740 --> 00:17:07,200
and then got paid to do...

301
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:09,200
I would say he's an extremely successful whatever.

302
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:10,200
Yeah.

303
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:13,100
Well, he made a movie in the 90s.

304
00:17:13,100 --> 00:17:19,000
He made a movie in the 90s called the Underground Comedy Movie where he does blackface and stuff.

305
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,520
It's like, "Oh, how do I make the most offensive movie?"

306
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:23,000
And then he made...

307
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:27,320
So then after the success of Slap Chop, he made Inappropriate Comedy.

308
00:17:27,320 --> 00:17:28,840
Oh, I know Inappropriate.

309
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:31,440
Which was supposed to be the sequel to Underground Comedy.

310
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:32,440
Oh, okay.

311
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:35,720
I never watched it, but I would always see it on Netflix when I was a kid.

312
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:42,760
it's Rob Schneider. It's a yeah then the whole the premise of that movie is like

313
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:46,920
all it's like vignettes but it's all like through it's like oh well this

314
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:52,120
that's what's happening because of this app. Honestly I'm sick of movies having

315
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:55,800
premises and if I made a movie I wouldn't have the premise. You should do

316
00:17:55,800 --> 00:18:00,680
like some Dublin 95 type shit. See that's a premise. That's a premise? I thought

317
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:04,920
that was a crazy rule. You just did a premise. No it's not a rule. The only

318
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:08,820
the movie rule that I would follow is a golden rule. Yeah, I would probably

319
00:18:08,820 --> 00:18:12,500
follow the rule of using a camera to film it and beyond that, all bets are

320
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:12,720
off.

321
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:15,400
My whole movie would be doing this.

322
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:19,260
You can make a movie every single day. That's what Apple should do instead of

323
00:18:19,260 --> 00:18:22,220
their damn goggles. They should make a camera that works with your fingers. I

324
00:18:22,220 --> 00:18:26,780
agree. Fingersquare camera. Here's a Apple, Apple, knife, nope.

325
00:18:26,780 --> 00:18:34,460
Hey, Apple, here's a question. How come the slogan of Apple Vision isn't "Become

326
00:18:34,460 --> 00:18:38,660
the apple of your eye. Think about that. That's pretty good. That is good. This

327
00:18:38,660 --> 00:18:43,340
guy's or a half an apple of your eye that you that's the apple of your eye.

328
00:18:43,340 --> 00:18:47,540
The apple of your eye, the apple of your eyes is what it should be. The apple

329
00:18:47,540 --> 00:18:54,980
for your eyes. That's what it should be. Wait, I phone iPhone, I Mac, I etc.

330
00:18:54,980 --> 00:19:01,660
I eyes, I paid glasses like from super monkey glasses. I paid for apple

331
00:19:02,540 --> 00:19:05,820
vision. Yeah, whatever happened in the eye, they say, call Apple Vision Pro.

332
00:19:05,820 --> 00:19:10,380
And also, this doesn't make any sense. You put on the headset and you see stuff

333
00:19:10,380 --> 00:19:14,900
and it becomes an apple, that's their whole product? That is not it, but you

334
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:17,660
could probably make it. You were close, yeah. Well, what's the product then?

335
00:19:17,660 --> 00:19:25,340
It's a type of goggle that makes you see the world through Steve Jobs' eyes.

336
00:19:25,340 --> 00:19:29,700
Yeah, but he only ate fruit. Yeah, exactly. And he was a bit of a fruit.

337
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:35,540
for a year. So every single food that you eat when you wear the goggles, it's like fruit.

338
00:19:35,540 --> 00:19:39,340
No, it doesn't taste like fruit, but it looks like an apple. Is that why they're called

339
00:19:39,340 --> 00:19:44,700
Apple? Uh huh. What? Because Steve Jobs ate fruit? Yeah. I think it was well before he

340
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:48,120
was a fruit. But it could have been that. I don't know. He's a fruit. A Terry and try

341
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:52,660
to cure his cancer with his fruits. People always say that, but I don't who I think it

342
00:19:52,660 --> 00:19:57,420
was probably that in the last year of your life, if you know you're going to die of cancer,

343
00:19:57,420 --> 00:20:02,860
like fuck it dude I like fruit. How many fruits can I eat? He's probably eating dude. Like

344
00:20:02,860 --> 00:20:07,220
if I spent the last part of my life eating sunflower seeds and beef jerky because I knew

345
00:20:07,220 --> 00:20:11,540
I had chemo or I was going to die of cancer and the chemo wasn't working, would everybody

346
00:20:11,540 --> 00:20:15,140
say like he tried to cure his cancer with beef jerky? Yeah I would say that. You would

347
00:20:15,140 --> 00:20:19,380
say that? Yeah actually I would say that. I would start that rumor I would say that

348
00:20:19,380 --> 00:20:23,340
the only thing that he ate towards the end of his life was the new spicy sweet chili

349
00:20:23,340 --> 00:20:28,180
Doritos, Jack Links. Yeah, but it's just because I like them. It's not because I was like,

350
00:20:28,180 --> 00:20:31,780
"Oh, this is going to cure cancer." It's going to cure... The nitrites are going to cure

351
00:20:31,780 --> 00:20:35,580
the tumor. Yeah, that doesn't make any sense. It's grown in my mouth. The guy liked grapefruits

352
00:20:35,580 --> 00:20:39,860
and watermelons. Yeah. Who doesn't? Maybe if he got grapefruited before he died, he

353
00:20:39,860 --> 00:20:44,780
wouldn't have died so sadly. What does that mean? Getting grapefruited? You never remember

354
00:20:44,780 --> 00:20:48,580
that video where the lady shows you how to give a blowjob with a grapefruit? First of

355
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:52,620
all, my dick is not fitting to the end of a grapefruit. No way. That is just... She's

356
00:20:52,620 --> 00:20:54,720
he's going to need a lime for me at that point

357
00:20:54,720 --> 00:21:04,500
and it's going to stay yeah and it's going to stay and even then it's just

358
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:08,600
going to sit right under the head right. It's going to be like that the juicer

359
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:13,840
thing yeah yeah exactly that's that's the exact like process like that's like,

360
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:17,480
but she says you put your dick through the grapefruit and then I'm still I put

361
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:21,800
my my mouth on your cock at the top wait. That's this guy's dick is fitting

362
00:21:21,820 --> 00:21:25,320
through a whole grapefruit all the way through. What the hell's wrong with this

363
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:28,080
guy? He needs to go to the hospital. He's got an elephantiasis of the penis.

364
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:32,220
Yeah. It's disgusting. It's disgusting too, 'cause I mean it's like

365
00:21:32,220 --> 00:21:36,580
grapefruits kind of have that... That's not the fruit I would want to be eating.

366
00:21:36,580 --> 00:21:39,360
Yeah, the taste of a grapefruit is kind of like... She better have that

367
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:43,100
shredded tongue. In my head it tastes like ink. Grapefruit kind of tastes like

368
00:21:43,100 --> 00:21:45,760
when you accidentally break a pen off in your mouth. I used to like grapefruit

369
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:48,200
when I was a kid. I used to eat grapefruit for breakfast. You put sugar

370
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:55,000
it though right? Tons. Yeah. It was worse than fruity pebbles. Plain grapefruit as a kid is

371
00:21:55,000 --> 00:22:00,280
like, you're like, oh, I thought there was going to be a big orange. It's fucking bullshit.

372
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:05,080
I wouldn't call it a romantic fruit or a sexual one. It's also kind of an expensive fruit.

373
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:10,360
That's why people think it's sexual, because it's pink and it looks like a damn labiar.

374
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:14,200
It does? No it doesn't look like it. What kind of labiars are you sitting on hanging

375
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:16,200
A big round one?

376
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:18,200
A big round one?

377
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:20,200
With a rind?

378
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:22,200
That's the jizz.

379
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:24,200
You jizz on the outside in a perfect circle?

380
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:27,200
The rind is actually all the cum that girls have.

381
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:29,200
Girls don't have it, they weren't born with cum.

382
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:31,200
Girls don't cum.

383
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:33,200
They can get it installed, but it's a very expensive procedure.

384
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:35,200
Yeah.

385
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:37,200
I heard about that.

386
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:39,200
I heard about that shit on LinkedIn.

387
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:41,200
You didn't hear about that on LinkedIn?

388
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:42,200
Do you have a LinkedIn?

389
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:43,200
I never did.

390
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:47,400
I had one for a little bit. Yeah, I made one for the podcast. I made one. Yeah,

391
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:52,560
we got one for the podcast. I think I might either made my my linkedin is it

392
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:57,440
says says co founder at Sullivan, the frog enterprises, and so I get a bunch

393
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:00,640
of emails all the time. They're like linkedin. It's like then it's like hey

394
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:03,120
new job opportunities for your position co founder.

395
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:12,280
One day we should go through our like our employee directory and all that

396
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:18,920
stuff that we just made for no reason. Oh yeah, it's all private on our notion. We

397
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:19,420
have like a

398
00:23:19,420 --> 00:23:23,080
we have an employee director on the website, but we also have like a

399
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:26,820
business. We have a secret one. We have one. What do you call a mission

400
00:23:26,820 --> 00:23:29,940
statement and all that stuff that's just sitting in our notion that nobody can

401
00:23:29,940 --> 00:23:34,380
ever read? Yeah, it's pretty cool. We should put out a hand, but we are a real

402
00:23:34,380 --> 00:23:38,480
company. Yeah, it's true. We are a public. We don't have any employees, though, do

403
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:43,300
something? Yeah, we do. We have just contractors. We just have one contractor

404
00:23:43,300 --> 00:23:49,460
and it's Jubio. We have two contractors. And patches. Wow. Just wow. Yeah. One of

405
00:23:49,460 --> 00:23:52,020
them really looks like a contractor too. The other one not so much.

406
00:23:52,020 --> 00:23:57,740
Okay, today we are doing... One guy looks like he knows his way around a

407
00:23:57,740 --> 00:24:00,820
contract. Yeah, exactly. Today...

408
00:24:00,820 --> 00:24:08,140
No. Yeah, if it wasn't already obvious from the, you know, the fucking title of

409
00:24:08,180 --> 00:24:12,940
episode in video. What's that? That's the apple of your eye. Today we have

410
00:24:12,940 --> 00:24:19,940
something so special for you guys, which is, have you ever been assaulted? Yeah. By

411
00:24:19,940 --> 00:24:24,660
who? Parents growing up. Most people don't bother with me because they can

412
00:24:24,660 --> 00:24:28,920
tell that I'm it. Brother and sister. I do think that happens with me. Yesterday I

413
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:32,380
brought the dog to the dog park and there was a bunch of skaters around and

414
00:24:32,380 --> 00:24:35,300
I was fantasizing about the skaters all attacking me at once and me killing

415
00:24:35,300 --> 00:24:39,800
every single nobody fucks with me, except for younger kids, because they don't

416
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:40,120
know

417
00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:46,900
most of you have a crazy situation. I don't want any smoke, but like sixth

418
00:24:46,900 --> 00:24:51,560
graders, I wouldn't played basketball and with Noah and me and we're playing

419
00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:54,460
basketball, torching them. By the way, he stepped in shit and walked home. He

420
00:24:54,460 --> 00:24:57,840
stepped in shit. He walked a big fail, tracked shit through my apartment, a

421
00:24:57,840 --> 00:25:00,740
full hour long fail where I beat him at basketball. Then he hurt his ankle and

422
00:25:00,740 --> 00:25:04,020
he stepped in shit on the way home. But anyway, besides the point we're playing

423
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:08,800
basketball. Why are we making fun of him? He had the worst day ever. And a bunch of kids

424
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:14,040
are riding their bikes and their scooters in the middle of our game, right? And as if

425
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:19,320
this wasn't pissing me off enough, like a four-year-old kid rides a scooter so slowly,

426
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:23,580
like it took him like a full 90 seconds to get from one end to the other. And as he's

427
00:25:23,580 --> 00:25:31,080
doing it, he keeps saying, "Watch out for me! Watch out for me! Watch out for me!" over

428
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:35,180
over and over and over again and I wanted to kill this kid. Children are so

429
00:25:35,180 --> 00:25:39,240
annoying. That's a horrible thing to say. Watch out for me. Make your parents

430
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:43,860
should say that. Yeah, watch out for him. Yeah, this kid. Hey, watch out and say

431
00:25:43,860 --> 00:25:46,680
it once and that means that the kid had the wherewithal to realize that he was

432
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:49,540
in the middle of something where he could get hit. He was doing what he

433
00:25:49,540 --> 00:25:53,560
wanted you to do was chase him and tickle him. I guess I'll do that next

434
00:25:53,560 --> 00:25:57,160
time. Yeah, there was this little kid that would run around. He lived like

435
00:25:57,180 --> 00:25:59,420
behind the skate park in Nashua.

436
00:25:59,420 --> 00:26:01,660
And he would like run up and down the ramps

437
00:26:01,660 --> 00:26:03,200
to like try and get people to hit him.

438
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:06,340
So that like his mom who had crazy anger issues

439
00:26:06,340 --> 00:26:09,180
would come over and try to fight the skaters.

440
00:26:09,180 --> 00:26:10,380
It was so insane.

441
00:26:10,380 --> 00:26:11,940
He would like run up and down the ramp

442
00:26:11,940 --> 00:26:13,140
and then like look at you like,

443
00:26:13,140 --> 00:26:14,900
like while you're trying to like go down

444
00:26:14,900 --> 00:26:16,580
and like try to like run into you.

445
00:26:16,580 --> 00:26:18,060
So you'd have to like dodge him.

446
00:26:18,060 --> 00:26:20,120
So like no one would go on the mini ramp.

447
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:22,900
And then there's this one time he like

448
00:26:22,900 --> 00:26:26,100
almost got decked out and then some kid just went like,

449
00:26:26,100 --> 00:26:28,100
"Yo, fucking move!"

450
00:26:28,100 --> 00:26:30,800
And we heard his mom over there just go like,

451
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:33,140
"What the fuck did you just say to my fucking son?"

452
00:26:33,140 --> 00:26:36,420
And then she ran over and while she's coming over,

453
00:26:36,420 --> 00:26:37,880
the little kid ran away and we go,

454
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:39,020
"You guys are idiots."

455
00:26:39,020 --> 00:26:40,620
And then ran away.

456
00:26:40,620 --> 00:26:42,180
- Homophobic story.

457
00:26:42,180 --> 00:26:43,580
- How's that homophobic?

458
00:26:43,580 --> 00:26:45,060
- You've tried to hit a little gay kid

459
00:26:45,060 --> 00:26:45,900
and his mom got mad at you?

460
00:26:45,900 --> 00:26:47,300
- I didn't try to hit a little gay kid,

461
00:26:47,300 --> 00:26:48,940
I was just doing little kid voice.

462
00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:50,020
- Little kid voice?

463
00:26:50,020 --> 00:26:51,260
- Little kid sound like this.

464
00:26:51,260 --> 00:26:53,020
- This kid was gay and you were bullying him

465
00:26:53,020 --> 00:26:53,860
at the skate park.

466
00:26:53,860 --> 00:26:54,700
- I'm not bullying a gay child.

467
00:26:54,700 --> 00:26:59,500
the bullying. I'll be one of the baby. No, he's trying to he was trying to be

468
00:26:59,500 --> 00:27:02,200
included. You think he thinks that he was trying to you think it should be

469
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:06,740
excluded. You should be executed. He should be executed because he was

470
00:27:06,740 --> 00:27:10,880
annoying. Next time a kid interrupts my basketball game, I am going to run at

471
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:14,400
them. I'm going to get you because if their parent comes and is like did you

472
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:17,680
say to my kid I'm going to get you like what are you talking about? Yeah, he

473
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:21,200
fucking crazy liar. Your kid is in the middle of my basketball game. I just

474
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:24,040
said get out honestly. You should keep him away from me because I could

475
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:27,300
could accidentally kill him. I could accidentally get him now. I'm not

476
00:27:27,300 --> 00:27:30,820
saying I'm not if I was dribbling the ball towards him, it could kill him. We

477
00:27:30,820 --> 00:27:33,860
play with a heavy ball. There's a regulation NBA basketball. Yeah, fifty

478
00:27:33,860 --> 00:27:38,900
five. It's pretty easy. It's pretty easy to like fake a fake an attack on the

479
00:27:38,900 --> 00:27:42,500
kid. Yeah, they just run away. Yeah, you just like flinch at anything. You

480
00:27:42,500 --> 00:27:45,540
have to do is around just like you're you like shoot like a half court shot

481
00:27:45,540 --> 00:27:49,540
and like aim it towards. Yeah, and just say what

482
00:27:50,660 --> 00:27:54,300
yeah, Kobe full chest pass. Yeah, I thought he's playing. Sorry. I thought

483
00:27:54,300 --> 00:27:54,620
of my

484
00:27:54,620 --> 00:27:56,460
I'm shacking a fool.

485
00:27:56,460 --> 00:28:00,220
Anyway, he was the only other person on the court with a shirt.

486
00:28:00,220 --> 00:28:05,520
My fucking team. Yeah, yeah, he's undersized for his position. Yeah,

487
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:08,960
whatever. Yeah, mugsy bogs or whatever. Yeah, but he's a court general. Look

488
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:12,740
at who it was. The mugsy bogs. Yeah, okay. He was like five five. Yeah, but

489
00:28:12,740 --> 00:28:13,300
he could dunk

490
00:28:13,300 --> 00:28:19,620
five four five dunk. Yeah. So today, if you ever find yourself in that position,

491
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:24,480
we're talking about martial arts that you can use to destroy basically anybody.

492
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:27,400
Martial arts that destroy a child.

493
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:31,520
For mine, I decided to look around on some of the martial arts forums. There's a lot

494
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:35,360
of them and they're very, very active and they've been active for a long time. This

495
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:39,840
first one is a post that says, "Gangster Rap is making a comeback." This is from Wrestling

496
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:45,040
Karate Champ. He said, "Youngbloods, 50 Cent are making gangster rap hot again. What are

497
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:48,240
you thoughts?" This is 2003. This is the height of 50 Mania.

498
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:49,240
Wow. Oh my God.

499
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:52,120
This is a height of 50 mania from wrestling karate champ who's a brown

500
00:28:52,120 --> 00:28:55,680
belt by the way. Yeah, you can see you got a picture of a brown belt there. He

501
00:28:55,680 --> 00:29:01,840
gets shut down fast. Yeah. Yeah. Valtor says I generally but not exclusively

502
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:06,920
prefer music with literary depth and vocal tenure over rhythmic monotony and

503
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:12,920
superfluous rhyming green. Wow. And read that signature. Keep smiling. And this

504
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:17,600
guy, so this guy, he's a pre black belt is a bocha dog. Oh, okay. So pre black

505
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:20,600
rap out. So yeah, he should be should listen to the brown belt. Listen to this

506
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:24,400
guy. Yeah, yeah, he shouldn't take offense. This is here. The brown belt is

507
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:27,440
oh everyone hating on rap. Why?

508
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:32,440
Oh my location Brooklyn. Oh my God, we can go hang out with this brown belt

509
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:37,080
shot. High school. He's a first name. He was in high school in 2003. This man is

510
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:43,000
probably older dead now old or dead. Yeah, anybody could be dead. Yeah, it's

511
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,440
not like an old. Yeah, he's dead from karate.

512
00:29:47,140 --> 00:29:47,640
you know.

513
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:52,660
This guy is just one single post. I didn't include any replies because

514
00:29:52,660 --> 00:29:56,460
people are just saying what is wrong with you. Mostly, but this guy says Hey

515
00:29:56,460 --> 00:30:01,260
guys, I do not have any interest in becoming a competitive fighter. I want

516
00:30:01,260 --> 00:30:03,580
to become one of the most lethal human beings

517
00:30:03,580 --> 00:30:09,780
able to protect my family and others. I want one day to be known as a walking

518
00:30:09,780 --> 00:30:14,100
killing machine. Wow, based on this info, what are the right arts for me to

519
00:30:14,140 --> 00:30:18,300
everybody. Thank you very much. Everybody people this guy everyone shut him down.

520
00:30:18,300 --> 00:30:21,820
There's a problem with these forums. You come in and you say on it. You'd be

521
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:25,180
honest. You're like I want to become a key, a killing machine. I want to kill

522
00:30:25,180 --> 00:30:29,300
every single thing I want. I want bugs to be afraid of me. I want plants to die

523
00:30:29,300 --> 00:30:34,100
when I walk by them and people give you nothing, dude. Yeah, so no, no advice.

524
00:30:34,100 --> 00:30:37,540
They give you a guff, yeah, complete guff, and they're making fun of this

525
00:30:37,540 --> 00:30:41,100
fuck. They give you guff and then they say, "Fug off," which is the reverse of

526
00:30:41,140 --> 00:30:45,060
backwards. But he sounds like a jock to me. And this next one is jocks.

527
00:30:45,060 --> 00:30:46,020
How about that's enough guff?

528
00:30:46,020 --> 00:30:48,420
This next one is jocks versus wimps, okay?

529
00:30:48,420 --> 00:30:51,460
Oh my God. We talk about this constantly.

530
00:30:51,460 --> 00:31:00,100
Yeah, I mean it's a defining social order, Peterson style. Jocks usually are drawn to

531
00:31:00,100 --> 00:31:02,100
the "Fuck, I made this too small."

532
00:31:02,100 --> 00:31:03,540
You did make it too small.

533
00:31:03,540 --> 00:31:10,180
No, I'm going to get closer. Jocks naturally gravitate to the something martial arts.

534
00:31:10,180 --> 00:31:19,180
Wimps normally gravitate to martial arts which are long on kava and short on competing.

535
00:31:19,180 --> 00:31:22,180
GBR, I gave him the GoPro, you can switch to that.

536
00:31:22,180 --> 00:31:28,180
Wimps will argue with the jocks on the web about which martial arts are the best,

537
00:31:28,180 --> 00:31:33,180
but the wimps will never face the jocks in an NHB match to prove the argument.

538
00:31:33,180 --> 00:31:39,180
This is because, deep down, the wimps know they will lose to the jocks and lose big time.

539
00:31:39,180 --> 00:31:43,580
big time. Okay to your camera and lose big time. Say it says this jock,

540
00:31:43,580 --> 00:31:49,480
but then a somebody responds and I want you to tell me if you think this person

541
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:53,700
is a wimp or a jock. Okay, okay, here we go. Go to the highlight the Google

542
00:31:53,700 --> 00:31:55,240
site, press a button.

543
00:31:55,240 --> 00:31:58,640
This is Edmond Blackadder.

544
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:05,800
You think he's a jock? No, no, no, no, he's a wimp. Knowing from the show,

545
00:32:05,860 --> 00:32:08,300
He is a total wimp, but he gets jocks to do his bidding.

546
00:32:08,300 --> 00:32:11,100
And he says, I stand between the darkness and the not bright.

547
00:32:11,100 --> 00:32:14,940
And he says, is that because jocks can't handle real martial arts and must limit themselves

548
00:32:14,940 --> 00:32:16,260
to the rules limited ones?

549
00:32:16,260 --> 00:32:19,760
I'm more of the opinion that real martial artists spend their time training, not trying

550
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:23,380
to prove how smart they is on this here interweb thing.

551
00:32:23,380 --> 00:32:28,140
Then again, their entire sites dedicated to the angsty wannabe who thinks that his UFC

552
00:32:28,140 --> 00:32:30,820
foo will save his lame ass in a street fight.

553
00:32:30,820 --> 00:32:34,380
Us wimps make sure we stay away from these morons and actually hope they do try for a

554
00:32:34,380 --> 00:32:40,780
submission when we roll. Makes it easier for us to stick 'em good with our blades. ROFL.

555
00:32:40,780 --> 00:32:45,160
Your argument is that if one doesn't compete, one is somehow a wimp. I say if one only trains

556
00:32:45,160 --> 00:32:49,420
to compete, one may hold trophies and medals, but be ill-prepared for a real fight. Having

557
00:32:49,420 --> 00:32:56,140
talked to a number of real deal people like Hawk Hakim and Mark Hatmaker, I tend to have

558
00:32:56,140 --> 00:32:59,820
a low opinion of the sports-only let's get in the ring and see who's a real man morons.

559
00:32:59,820 --> 00:33:04,060
Personally, I think they and the whole pressure test your art crowd suffer from some serious

560
00:33:04,060 --> 00:33:09,460
problems. They should be like the French and run away, but the job fires back.

561
00:33:09,460 --> 00:33:10,540
The jock says

562
00:33:10,540 --> 00:33:17,260
us. So he's quoting him, Edmund Blackadder and says the I'm too deadly

563
00:33:17,260 --> 00:33:20,900
to compete argument. Thanks for the example of how wimps argue, but are too

564
00:33:20,900 --> 00:33:26,180
afraid to fight. But Blackadder comes back strong as he does and he brings a

565
00:33:26,180 --> 00:33:30,220
poem. Would you say he goes forth? He brings a poem called Gentleman Rankers

566
00:33:30,220 --> 00:33:34,220
by Rudyard Kipling from 1892.

567
00:33:34,220 --> 00:33:35,220
Kipling.

568
00:33:35,220 --> 00:33:40,260
And the entire thing is too long to see on this thing, but basically he, this is the

569
00:33:40,260 --> 00:33:43,260
utmost known from Wimps, I would say.

570
00:33:43,260 --> 00:33:44,660
So Wimps came out on top here.

571
00:33:44,660 --> 00:33:46,660
Rudyard Kipling wrote the Jungle Book.

572
00:33:46,660 --> 00:33:48,060
Wimps weren't Jock Zero.

573
00:33:48,060 --> 00:33:49,060
I don't know.

574
00:33:49,060 --> 00:33:50,060
I don't know who Rudyard Kipling is.

575
00:33:50,060 --> 00:33:53,940
So Wimps are a bunch of racist stuff.

576
00:33:53,940 --> 00:33:57,060
Well that makes sense that Edmund Blackadder would be a fan of him, I guess.

577
00:33:57,060 --> 00:34:00,060
He's also a big Rowan Atkinson fan, if that's his fucking name.

578
00:34:00,060 --> 00:34:01,060
I mean, clearly.

579
00:34:01,060 --> 00:34:02,060
Yeah.

580
00:34:02,060 --> 00:34:03,060
Okay.

581
00:34:03,060 --> 00:34:07,060
And then I just have one more thing here, which is from another martial arts forum.

582
00:34:07,060 --> 00:34:14,540
The topic is, "Has a gay guy at your academy ever make people feel uncomfortable?"

583
00:34:14,540 --> 00:34:18,660
This person says, "Has a gay guy at your academy ever make people feel uncomfortable?

584
00:34:18,660 --> 00:34:22,180
There's a gay guy that joined the academy I train at five months ago.

585
00:34:22,180 --> 00:34:24,020
He's not bad for a blue belt.

586
00:34:24,020 --> 00:34:25,340
Actually has some skills.

587
00:34:25,340 --> 00:34:29,160
And he acted like a very decent guy at first who's very cool and chill.

588
00:34:29,160 --> 00:34:32,380
But he started acting weirder and weirder each time.

589
00:34:32,380 --> 00:34:36,960
He told everyone he was kicked out of at least 5 other academies before because they were

590
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:39,800
bigots and felt uncomfortable with rolling with him.

591
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:44,200
He posted all over social media which academies it was that kicked him out because they were

592
00:34:44,200 --> 00:34:46,960
bigots, intolerance, things like that.

593
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:48,580
But now I can see why.

594
00:34:48,580 --> 00:34:52,300
The guy makes a lot of my other classmates feel uncomfortable too.

595
00:34:52,300 --> 00:34:56,640
Like for example, when he introduces himself to everyone, he always brings it up that he's

596
00:34:56,640 --> 00:34:57,640
gay.

597
00:34:57,640 --> 00:35:00,800
I mean, who the fuck cares who you like to bang?

598
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:02,940
This is a grappling class.

599
00:35:02,940 --> 00:35:04,360
Stay on the subject.

600
00:35:04,360 --> 00:35:09,060
And he would say weird, nasty things out of nowhere while doing a water break.

601
00:35:09,060 --> 00:35:17,480
Such as, a lot of guys hate tossing salad, but love getting their salad tossed.

602
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:20,060
Nobody said anything, and were grossed out.

603
00:35:20,060 --> 00:35:23,060
While the gay guy was laughing all by himself.

604
00:35:23,060 --> 00:35:27,860
Sometimes when he rolls with people, he would have a creepy smile right afterwards or during

605
00:35:27,860 --> 00:35:29,860
a roll.

606
00:35:29,860 --> 00:35:31,840
I made it clear I don't want to roll with him.

607
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:33,240
He makes me feel uncomfortable.

608
00:35:33,240 --> 00:35:37,900
On his Facebook, he posting pictures of him making out with multiple dudes all at once.

609
00:35:37,900 --> 00:35:41,660
I had to unfollow him and so did a lot of people that I trained together with.

610
00:35:41,660 --> 00:35:46,140
Our instructor didn't want to say anything because he's afraid the gay guy will post

611
00:35:46,140 --> 00:35:48,820
on Facebook or Yelp telling everyone we're bigots.

612
00:35:48,820 --> 00:35:52,620
but seriously, though, this guy is just a creep in a sneaky way. It's hard to

613
00:35:52,620 --> 00:35:56,460
describe. I hope he leaves on his own very soon. Anyone ever had something

614
00:35:56,460 --> 00:36:01,660
like this guy at their academy before? And this dude had it. Imagine this

615
00:36:01,660 --> 00:36:07,220
scenario, though. You all get together in your dojo, and you're having an

616
00:36:07,220 --> 00:36:10,500
intervention with the gay guy. You say, "You have to stop saying such gay stuff

617
00:36:10,500 --> 00:36:13,580
and acting so gay." He's posting you, making out with multiple dudes, by the

618
00:36:13,580 --> 00:36:17,780
way. So he's also polysexual. You're all standing around him. He strikes the

619
00:36:17,780 --> 00:36:23,860
goes, the music starts. He likes striking. One gay guy defeats 99 straights. Yeah.

620
00:36:23,860 --> 00:36:29,020
Movie. Tarantino. And you know that song, Frankie Goes to Hollywood, Two Tribes Go to

621
00:36:29,020 --> 00:36:36,540
War. I don't know. The Gays vs. the Straights. I was thinking more like John Wick type music.

622
00:36:36,540 --> 00:36:41,780
No, that song is John Wick style. They need to make that movie. Gay Guy vs. Straight Guy.

623
00:36:41,780 --> 00:36:46,240
indiscriminately killing straight guys or straights? It's on its way.

624
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:51,520
L G B T K I L L. That's what I would call it. That's what I would call it.

625
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:56,100
Oh my God. That's pretty good. Yeah. Or gay Bill. Yeah.

626
00:36:56,100 --> 00:37:02,240
Okay. The gay. The gay guy. I don't know. I'm not that good at it. I'm

627
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:06,000
not a professional movie namer. Oh, the gay guy man, like the bye bye man.

628
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:11,020
Yeah. Or like it man. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. So this person responds with a

629
00:37:11,060 --> 00:37:17,780
very harrowing story. This next person, okay? And they say, here select that, they say,

630
00:37:17,780 --> 00:37:28,220
a gay guy once gave me a wedgie. Chuck's manhood. A gay guy once gave me a wedgie. Speaking of

631
00:37:28,220 --> 00:37:29,220
jocks versus wimps.

632
00:37:29,220 --> 00:37:33,100
Bro, your manhood was Chuck the fuck out when that gay guy gave you that wedgie.

633
00:37:33,100 --> 00:37:37,300
How do you face your family at Thanksgiving knowing that a gay guy gave you a wedgie one

634
00:37:37,300 --> 00:37:38,300
time?

635
00:37:38,300 --> 00:37:39,300
Yeah.

636
00:37:39,300 --> 00:37:40,300
It's over. Your life's over.

637
00:37:40,300 --> 00:37:43,340
I mean, that's why you devote your life to martial arts. You leave your wife and

638
00:37:43,340 --> 00:37:43,780
kids.

639
00:37:43,780 --> 00:37:46,060
Asceticism. Yeah, you're a monk. You live on a mountain.

640
00:37:46,060 --> 00:37:50,300
And this person makes a similar point. They say, "Did he do that to you while

641
00:37:50,300 --> 00:37:52,700
rolling? This should be considered sexual harassment."

642
00:37:52,700 --> 00:37:53,180
Yeah.

643
00:37:53,180 --> 00:37:53,820
A gay guy.

644
00:37:53,820 --> 00:37:54,940
What does that mean, "while rolling"?

645
00:37:54,940 --> 00:37:56,300
Rolling is what they do.

646
00:37:56,300 --> 00:37:56,620
Yeah.

647
00:37:56,620 --> 00:37:57,580
That's like a spar.

648
00:37:57,580 --> 00:37:58,140
Oh.

649
00:37:58,140 --> 00:37:58,380
Yeah.

650
00:37:58,380 --> 00:37:59,020
Yeah.

651
00:37:59,020 --> 00:37:59,340
Okay.

652
00:37:59,340 --> 00:38:00,700
I know Aikido is rolling.

653
00:38:00,700 --> 00:38:04,620
He's saying that while they're doing Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, this guy wedged him.

654
00:38:04,620 --> 00:38:08,140
And he thinks that that should be sexual. So I think that it's no holds barred.

655
00:38:08,140 --> 00:38:11,340
I'm not sure the guy should be wearing underwear in the first place. Yeah, let

656
00:38:11,340 --> 00:38:16,840
that thing fly. Yeah, just wear the wear the gee. Yeah, they did a samurai did not

657
00:38:16,840 --> 00:38:19,700
even know what underwear was that was English. They didn't understand. I think

658
00:38:19,700 --> 00:38:23,140
the gay guy was revealing that he was dressed in a dishonorable fashion

659
00:38:23,140 --> 00:38:27,020
exactly and he was exploiting it and let me guess the underwear at hearts on it.

660
00:38:27,020 --> 00:38:32,420
Yep, this is why this is why many people who do Brazilian Jiu Jitsu, they don't

661
00:38:32,420 --> 00:38:35,700
have long hair. They have short hair because in a street fight you can grab

662
00:38:35,700 --> 00:38:39,420
their hair and you can put it on your crotch or something embarrassing. A

663
00:38:39,420 --> 00:38:43,060
similar thing with wearing underwear. If you wear underwear, you're at a high

664
00:38:43,060 --> 00:38:46,060
risk of somebody wedgieing you if they feel like it would give them the upper

665
00:38:46,060 --> 00:38:49,300
hand in a battle. Also, if you have long hair in a fight, they can cut your

666
00:38:49,300 --> 00:38:54,500
hair and it will cause psychological damage. And hair damage. The risk of a

667
00:38:54,500 --> 00:38:58,660
wedgie on the street just constantly, 50% of the time,

668
00:38:58,660 --> 00:39:04,140
50% risk. At any given time. At any given time, somebody could run up on

669
00:39:04,140 --> 00:39:08,840
you pull up your your your I think I would rather be knockout game with a

670
00:39:08,840 --> 00:39:14,060
brick than be wedged on the street. Oh my God, can you imagine that video being

671
00:39:14,060 --> 00:39:18,340
your your legacy forever and then people are looking wedged and then I feel like

672
00:39:18,340 --> 00:39:22,460
people would have the same fervor that they have for like like finding

673
00:39:22,460 --> 00:39:26,940
somebody's finding a Karen's job or something just to find out my name and

674
00:39:26,940 --> 00:39:30,820
phone number so that people can call me after that. Yeah, like it wouldn't even

675
00:39:30,840 --> 00:39:34,680
maybe they're not even mad at me. I just got doing stand up yeah exactly it

676
00:39:34,680 --> 00:39:38,680
would be every single I would never escape you. If you got in public,

677
00:39:38,680 --> 00:39:41,200
yeah, you have to you'd have to make it your identity. You have to start

678
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:44,800
everything you do. Yeah, I got wedgie guy ten years from now. I'm running

679
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:50,120
for president wedgie guy. I'm hosting some some house tour show on any yeah

680
00:39:50,120 --> 00:39:54,800
on any as the wedgie guy. I don't want that man. The documentary about my life

681
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:59,760
comes out to wedgie guy. You find out that I there was a that I you find out

682
00:39:59,780 --> 00:40:04,080
was all staged. That would be sad. That's what I'm going to do. I'm going to do

683
00:40:04,080 --> 00:40:06,260
like a Jesse Smollett thing about me getting wet

684
00:40:06,260 --> 00:40:08,460
by two jocks.

685
00:40:08,460 --> 00:40:14,480
Yeah, the jocks came in and wedgie, but then you find out that I actually hired

686
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:15,500
two wimps to do it.

687
00:40:15,500 --> 00:40:20,080
That's scary. That is scary. That could actually happen.

688
00:40:20,080 --> 00:40:24,940
And then one last thing, there's a super troopers reference. This guy says I'd

689
00:40:24,940 --> 00:40:28,380
call him a chicken fucker for twenty dollars. Wow, so that guy's pretty

690
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:29,400
That's fucking funny.

691
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:31,000
Yeah, that guy is fucking funny.

692
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:32,000
That's it for my stuff.

693
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:35,000
Supa Troopas, dollar bills y'all.

694
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:37,000
What are you doing?

695
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:38,000
Dollar bills y'all.

696
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:39,000
What?

697
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:40,000
I don't even know.

698
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:41,000
I don't even know.

699
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:45,120
I thought that that would make sense and it didn't.

700
00:40:45,120 --> 00:40:46,120
Dollar bills y'all.

701
00:40:46,120 --> 00:40:47,120
Dollar bills y'all.

702
00:40:47,120 --> 00:40:49,400
I was just being random as fuck to do it.

703
00:40:49,400 --> 00:40:50,400
That's okay.

704
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:51,400
You can be random.

705
00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:52,400
What do you have?

706
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:53,400
What are your researches y'all?

707
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:57,600
This is my slideshow about the greatest martial artists of all time.

708
00:40:57,600 --> 00:40:59,440
So I didn't know what to do for this.

709
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:02,880
My first slideshow that I made had too many videos in it, and that's bad radio.

710
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:05,920
So we're just going to look through all the famous martial artists that I started

711
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:07,960
looking up on the computer.

712
00:41:07,960 --> 00:41:10,160
First one, Bruce Lee, most famous.

713
00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:11,880
Cool uncles wear a shirt of him.

714
00:41:11,880 --> 00:41:15,040
And also, he wore a cool shirt.

715
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:16,200
He wore a cool shirt.

716
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:16,880
Yellow shirt.

717
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:17,240
Yeah.

718
00:41:17,240 --> 00:41:17,640
Yeah.

719
00:41:17,640 --> 00:41:18,560
Look at that yellow shirt.

720
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:19,200
Classic yellow shirt.

721
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:23,080
Next guy, Chuck Norris, the first white guy to ever do martial arts.

722
00:41:23,080 --> 00:41:24,880
And he's pretty damn good too.

723
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:25,880
Pretty damn good at it.

724
00:41:25,880 --> 00:41:28,240
And he's handsome and I heard he did all sorts of things.

725
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:30,080
And you know when he crosses the street the cars like that.

726
00:41:30,080 --> 00:41:32,720
Apparently when he does a push up he does 100 push ups.

727
00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:33,720
Yep.

728
00:41:33,720 --> 00:41:37,960
Then the next one my grandpa he does Aikido and some other.

729
00:41:37,960 --> 00:41:38,960
Some other martial art.

730
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:41,280
I don't have any pics of him doing Aikido.

731
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:44,580
I just have I really only have this one photo of him.

732
00:41:44,580 --> 00:41:48,340
This is the only photo of my grandfather.

733
00:41:48,340 --> 00:41:49,340
That could be Aikido.

734
00:41:49,340 --> 00:41:51,960
He looks like he's maybe thinking about Aikido.

735
00:41:51,960 --> 00:41:52,960
Maybe.

736
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:56,960
Jackie Chan used something called "drunken boxing" for his film The Drunken Master.

737
00:41:56,960 --> 00:41:57,960
What does that mean?

738
00:41:57,960 --> 00:42:00,920
And I saw that and I was like, "What the hell is drunken boxing?"

739
00:42:00,920 --> 00:42:06,440
So I looked into it and "drunken boxing" is the general name for all styles of Chinese

740
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:11,200
martial arts that imitate the movements of a drunk person.

741
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:15,680
Drunken boxing is not a single martial art with an established lineage and hierarchy,

742
00:42:15,680 --> 00:42:18,720
but rather a group of loosely related kung fu styles.

743
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:24,000
In this respect, drunken boxing could also be understood as a phenomenon within Kung

744
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:25,000
Fu.

745
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:26,000
A phenomenon.

746
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,840
That word phenomenon made me remember this phenomenon.

747
00:42:28,840 --> 00:42:32,200
Jar Jar Binks is actually a Sith Lord and Drunken Fist Master.

748
00:42:32,200 --> 00:42:33,960
If you guys remember that.

749
00:42:33,960 --> 00:42:38,400
I don't remember that he was a Drunken Fist Master.

750
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:40,040
Then there's an example here.

751
00:42:40,040 --> 00:42:43,040
If you take a look at the very opening of the film, you can see Jar Jar Binks doing

752
00:42:43,040 --> 00:42:47,760
like a similar starting pose as a Drunken Fist Thing.

753
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:53,560
is crazy. Yeah, I didn't clap. They had a little clap there, I guess is a similar pose. Then

754
00:42:53,560 --> 00:43:00,200
I started thinking, what kind of accent does Jar Jar have? Alien. Yeah, Gungan accent. But

755
00:43:00,200 --> 00:43:07,400
what is it based on in the real world? Turkey. A Jamaican accent. Now hear me out. I found

756
00:43:07,400 --> 00:43:13,520
a list of on Jamaicans.com that said there are seven and seven interesting facts about

757
00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:18,660
about the Irish influence in Jamaica. The Jamaican accent shares elements of the

758
00:43:18,660 --> 00:43:23,760
Irish accent. The Irish lived with the newly arrived African slaves. Some taught

759
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:29,280
the slaves the English language. The Irish guttural accent is still evident

760
00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:29,300
today.

761
00:43:29,300 --> 00:43:32,240
That can't be true. The Jamaican accent is an Irish accent?

762
00:43:32,240 --> 00:43:36,660
Technically, by that logic, Jar Jar Binks has an Irish accent.

763
00:43:36,660 --> 00:43:41,480
But let's look at it a little closer. This is a list of stereotypes of Irish

764
00:43:42,500 --> 00:43:45,820
So violence, food, alcoholism, red hair.

765
00:43:45,820 --> 00:43:47,180
How's food a stereotype?

766
00:43:47,180 --> 00:43:49,180
Yeah, they're the worst food in the world.

767
00:43:49,180 --> 00:43:53,420
I guess a stereotypical foods are corned beef, cabbage, and potatoes.

768
00:43:53,420 --> 00:43:54,420
That's just the things they eat.

769
00:43:54,420 --> 00:43:56,060
Wait, how's that a stereotype?

770
00:43:56,060 --> 00:43:59,140
These people are such a fucking victim complex.

771
00:43:59,140 --> 00:44:00,820
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

772
00:44:00,820 --> 00:44:02,580
They think that we eat potatoes.

773
00:44:02,580 --> 00:44:03,580
Shut up!

774
00:44:03,580 --> 00:44:05,620
Hold on, hold on.

775
00:44:05,620 --> 00:44:07,220
Notice anything peculiar?

776
00:44:07,220 --> 00:44:09,260
Yes, food.

777
00:44:09,260 --> 00:44:13,420
Jar Jar Binks exhibits every single one of these stereotypes. Look at this.

778
00:44:13,420 --> 00:44:17,180
Wow. He is a completely violent man. Look at him in the battlefield. He is

779
00:44:17,180 --> 00:44:21,380
eating food and look, there's Jar Jar Binks pouring himself a glass of

780
00:44:21,380 --> 00:44:26,100
what looks like whiskey. And also in all those photos, he has red hair.

781
00:44:26,100 --> 00:44:28,820
These are his ears, Patrick. This is red hair. It's an

782
00:44:28,820 --> 00:44:34,460
Jar Jar Binks is Irish. It's inconclusive. It's inconclusive. Now that we know

783
00:44:34,460 --> 00:44:37,260
he's Irish, doesn't the drunken master thing

784
00:44:38,500 --> 00:44:42,600
Doesn't doesn't this drunken master thing make a little bit more sense?

785
00:44:42,600 --> 00:44:47,800
Are you attacking us? What's going on PowerPoint comedy dude? Doesn't this

786
00:44:47,800 --> 00:44:52,000
make a little bit more sense that the drunken master? Let's circle back to

787
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:55,100
the Darth Jar Jar theory. Wait, doesn't what make more sense? Let's circle back

788
00:44:55,100 --> 00:44:58,600
to this Darth Jar Jar theory real quick. Jar Jar Binks takes control of the

789
00:44:58,600 --> 00:45:02,400
Senate and was supposed to be become emperor. That's not a real, that's not

790
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:06,100
from any canon Star Wars thing. Let me go through this.

791
00:45:06,900 --> 00:45:08,900
What's an emperor? It's like the president.

792
00:45:08,900 --> 00:45:12,100
Look at the list. Here's a list of Irish presidents.

793
00:45:12,100 --> 00:45:14,400
Jar Jar Binks could have been an Irish president.

794
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:17,300
You got Joe Biden, Michael D. Higgins, the Irish president.

795
00:45:17,300 --> 00:45:18,600
It goes deeper.

796
00:45:18,600 --> 00:45:21,700
This is a list of US presidents with Irish blood.

797
00:45:21,700 --> 00:45:23,500
That's a most of the US president.

798
00:45:23,500 --> 00:45:24,900
Wasn't Kennedy Irish too?

799
00:45:24,900 --> 00:45:25,900
Yeah, he's on there.

800
00:45:25,900 --> 00:45:30,280
This is a post from r/conspiracy detailing the Hibernian

801
00:45:30,280 --> 00:45:31,800
conspiracy iceberg.

802
00:45:31,800 --> 00:45:33,500
It's inconclusive.

803
00:45:33,500 --> 00:45:35,100
The Irish control everything.

804
00:45:35,100 --> 00:45:36,400
It's still inconclusive?

805
00:45:36,500 --> 00:45:40,740
The Irish control the media. What is media? It controls the people. Look right here. Media

806
00:45:40,740 --> 00:45:45,780
is Internet, radio, television, magazines, newspaper. Wait a second. Radio podcaster

807
00:45:45,780 --> 00:45:51,500
Raider. We are doing a podcast. Half of us are Irish. I don't claim Irish, by the way.

808
00:45:51,500 --> 00:45:56,780
I'm Irish because I ran to you. Not half of us. Well, you're Irish. No, you would know

809
00:45:56,780 --> 00:46:02,460
because on race on race off, I was I was Irish on race off. You don't remember. No, that

810
00:46:02,460 --> 00:46:05,660
that county cork that ruins this whole thing there.

811
00:46:05,660 --> 00:46:10,340
He doesn't even remember. I won't now you're Polish and African. You can be

812
00:46:10,340 --> 00:46:13,820
not Irish. You said you couldn't claim, but I'm technically more Irish than you

813
00:46:13,820 --> 00:46:17,740
know yeah fine. Well, I'm Irish because of my grandpa, not just my Aikido

814
00:46:17,740 --> 00:46:21,300
grandpa, but my dead one too and my dead grandma's and also both of my ancestors

815
00:46:21,300 --> 00:46:24,620
on both sides and then Caleb is sixty eight percent Irish.

816
00:46:24,620 --> 00:46:29,740
I re watched race off and it did. I don't remember anything about you being

817
00:46:29,780 --> 00:46:34,180
Irish in it, but Caleb, who do we control through the podcast? The

818
00:46:34,180 --> 00:46:37,740
listeners of our show. That's a photo of our last live show.

819
00:46:37,740 --> 00:46:42,500
Most importantly, though, we control Cameron and Jubio. Oh, that's a nice

820
00:46:42,500 --> 00:46:46,460
picture. I don't have that picture. Through what? Are drunken fists. We do

821
00:46:46,460 --> 00:46:50,420
like drinking more than the other two. Also, I controlled Cameron through a

822
00:46:50,420 --> 00:46:53,940
mental martial art to say this. Now, Cameron, why don't you take a read of

823
00:46:53,940 --> 00:46:57,860
this? This isn't real. No, no, I want you... You read for your part and he'll

824
00:46:57,900 --> 00:47:01,500
for his part in this text thread that we have a photo of okay go. Is there a

825
00:47:01,500 --> 00:47:06,000
yellow one? They should have a double sided one of brown and yellow. No, but

826
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:10,800
you want one. You want to put your mouth on the yellow. It's written no, but you

827
00:47:10,800 --> 00:47:15,300
want one. You want to put your mouth on the yellow saber. Yeah, you want to suck

828
00:47:15,300 --> 00:47:19,400
down the yellow lightsaber. I want to suck down the yellow saber. Where did I

829
00:47:19,400 --> 00:47:20,700
learn this mental martial art

830
00:47:20,700 --> 00:47:26,700
from my grandpa? That was the other martial art. I talked about earlier pose.

831
00:47:27,200 --> 00:47:31,200
So in conclusion, the Irish are the greatest martial artists of all time.

832
00:47:31,200 --> 00:47:33,320
So it finally concludes.

833
00:47:33,320 --> 00:47:35,200
So now it's conclusive.

834
00:47:35,200 --> 00:47:36,760
Okay. And there's a YouTube.

835
00:47:36,760 --> 00:47:38,960
It was supposed to play automatically, but we don't.

836
00:47:38,960 --> 00:47:40,480
It's not even playing at all.

837
00:47:40,480 --> 00:47:41,640
Yeah. Okay. That's fine.

838
00:47:41,640 --> 00:47:43,080
We don't really need to see that.

839
00:47:43,080 --> 00:47:44,360
Yeah. But was it going to be?

840
00:47:44,360 --> 00:47:45,920
Shipping up to Boston?

841
00:47:45,920 --> 00:47:47,160
It was something like that. Yeah.

842
00:47:47,160 --> 00:47:47,720
What was it?

843
00:47:47,720 --> 00:47:49,680
It was you can't beat the Irish.

844
00:47:49,680 --> 00:47:51,120
Oh, you should have done shipping up to Boston.

845
00:47:51,120 --> 00:47:52,120
Yeah, I should have done that.

846
00:47:53,360 --> 00:47:58,360
But that's got to be one of the most just nonsense things I've ever heard in my life.

847
00:47:58,360 --> 00:48:01,360
But I did enjoy myself because I like arguing against you.

848
00:48:01,360 --> 00:48:02,360
Yeah.

849
00:48:02,360 --> 00:48:03,360
Even though you're my Irish brother.

850
00:48:03,360 --> 00:48:09,360
I had to change my whole thing because the other one that I wanted to do was I think

851
00:48:09,360 --> 00:48:12,360
probably 12 minutes of videos of a guy.

852
00:48:12,360 --> 00:48:16,360
This, the new set should be just all, we should just do Ireland.

853
00:48:16,360 --> 00:48:17,360
Yeah.

854
00:48:17,360 --> 00:48:18,360
Yes.

855
00:48:18,360 --> 00:48:19,360
No.

856
00:48:19,360 --> 00:48:20,360
No, we won't do that.

857
00:48:20,360 --> 00:48:21,360
No, we're not going to do that.

858
00:48:21,360 --> 00:48:22,360
Okay.

859
00:48:22,360 --> 00:48:30,040
I did yeah all right now. I'll let's take it back to real martial arts guys. You

860
00:48:30,040 --> 00:48:35,300
said it is Irish bullshit honky, drunken fist that we all benefit from. So I've

861
00:48:35,300 --> 00:48:40,120
been reading a lot of old comic books from the 60s and you I've been reading

862
00:48:40,120 --> 00:48:43,200
them from scans where they scan in the comic books and they have a bunch of the

863
00:48:43,200 --> 00:48:47,920
old ads that they have and they have you know it's order an X-ray glasses,

864
00:48:47,940 --> 00:48:52,840
X-ray glasses monkeys become strong how to have a male voice. If you're a boy

865
00:48:52,840 --> 00:48:57,240
stuff like that gun targeted, not so many gun rubber band gun rubber band gun.

866
00:48:57,240 --> 00:49:01,140
Yes, very good rubber band ball remote control. Ghost is a classic one that my

867
00:49:01,140 --> 00:49:03,840
dad would always tell me about where you order it and it says remote control

868
00:49:03,840 --> 00:49:07,840
ghost and you get it and it's a balloon with a sheet and you get it in a box

869
00:49:07,840 --> 00:49:10,840
and it's just a remote control. You just pulled you pull the string on the

870
00:49:10,840 --> 00:49:14,840
balloon to control, but there's the here's an ad that I saw that was

871
00:49:14,840 --> 00:49:21,080
fascinating me. You be was a okay. Okay, boys men. I'll help you master you be

872
00:49:21,080 --> 00:49:25,320
was a says NJ Fleming you be was a master you be was a is the secret

873
00:49:25,320 --> 00:49:30,280
amazingly easy art of self-defense that turns just one finger of your hands into

874
00:49:30,280 --> 00:49:34,720
a potent weapon of defense without any bodily contact. Oh my God, here's some

875
00:49:34,720 --> 00:49:38,960
other parts of the ad master every situation make no mistake. The world is

876
00:49:38,960 --> 00:49:42,800
crowded with anti-social enemies who think nothing of sticking a knife into

877
00:49:42,800 --> 00:49:46,600
for the ribs or attacking peace loving citizens just for the fun of it or

878
00:49:46,600 --> 00:49:50,340
molesting boys and girls shamelessly. This is in Spider Man. What was in this

879
00:49:50,340 --> 00:49:54,920
was in Spider Man or knocking off the side of the exactly somebody's car. I

880
00:49:54,920 --> 00:49:59,220
just would put that out there. There is a crying need for a system of self

881
00:49:59,220 --> 00:50:03,060
defense that relies on knowledge, not big muscles or strength. Yeah, that

882
00:50:03,060 --> 00:50:07,460
depends on technique, not on weight or size of body. That is based on simple

883
00:50:07,460 --> 00:50:11,920
training, not on illegal possession of weapons. And here's another part of the

884
00:50:11,960 --> 00:50:17,520
had it's a picture of of Yoshi Imanami. I weigh only ninety eight pounds, yet I

885
00:50:17,520 --> 00:50:20,660
can paralyze a two hundred pound attacker with just a finger because I

886
00:50:20,660 --> 00:50:25,320
know you be was a says Yoshi Imanami pretty Japanese wife of MJ Fleming, you

887
00:50:25,320 --> 00:50:26,360
be was a master.

888
00:50:26,360 --> 00:50:31,920
So I was looking up for my power point. I saw this at a while ago and I wanted

889
00:50:31,920 --> 00:50:36,400
to do a deep dive into this and look who's a MJ Fleming. What's the deal with

890
00:50:36,400 --> 00:50:40,640
this martial art? You be was a I made a power point about it and then, as I was

891
00:50:40,680 --> 00:50:43,680
some research, I stumbled on something else and I deleted the rest of my

892
00:50:43,680 --> 00:50:47,220
PowerPoint because this is more important than I found that you was has

893
00:50:47,220 --> 00:50:50,660
guided me to something I could never have believed. Yeah,

894
00:50:50,660 --> 00:50:58,500
you be was a two point. Oh, my God, by Eddie, we ten a grand master founder,

895
00:50:58,500 --> 00:51:02,500
a guarded exclusive confidential course. This is the cover of a book. He wrote

896
00:51:02,500 --> 00:51:06,140
about you be was a can we get a bigger photo of this? Because is that the

897
00:51:06,140 --> 00:51:09,820
Freemasons logo right there? Is that the Aerosmith logo? There's all sorts of

898
00:51:09,860 --> 00:51:13,360
so good. This guy is also a graphic designer. As you'll see, tell yeah,

899
00:51:13,360 --> 00:51:16,440
we're going to go through a lot of his book covers and a lot of stuff like

900
00:51:16,440 --> 00:51:20,560
this, but this guy is what's his name? Eddie, we ten a right. We can you bro.

901
00:51:20,560 --> 00:51:22,380
I think he is. I thought that was

902
00:51:22,380 --> 00:51:29,000
he developed you be was a two point. Oh boys men. So you can see he took it

903
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:33,100
from the ad boys men. I'll help you master you be was a two point. Oh,

904
00:51:33,100 --> 00:51:36,700
Murray was a clock theory. Oh my God, look at and then he has he looks like

905
00:51:36,780 --> 00:51:39,980
sub zero there. I don't think that's him. I think that's cgi that he made,

906
00:51:39,980 --> 00:51:43,920
because he also makes cgi, but he has something called clock theory that I've

907
00:51:43,920 --> 00:51:48,260
never found any explanation. He just writes it under a lot of stuff, but he

908
00:51:48,260 --> 00:51:53,120
invented this this art called Maria was a which is his the deadliest martial

909
00:51:53,120 --> 00:51:56,260
art in that is you. You want to point out? I think you be was a two point. O

910
00:51:56,260 --> 00:51:58,620
is contained inside Maria was gotcha

911
00:51:58,620 --> 00:52:04,060
here. So I teach Maria was a the way of unlimited techniques. That's what he

912
00:52:04,100 --> 00:52:07,900
calls it. It has unlimited techniques and I've been doing so for over fifty years.

913
00:52:07,900 --> 00:52:12,220
I have had plenty of time to research and learn all styles of martial arts. I

914
00:52:12,220 --> 00:52:17,940
borrowed the best techniques out there, secret or otherwise, and eliminated many

915
00:52:17,940 --> 00:52:22,100
pointless, complicated, inefficient or cinematic type moves to create what

916
00:52:22,100 --> 00:52:26,940
Maria was is today as part of my quest to design the most deadly fighting art in

917
00:52:26,940 --> 00:52:30,620
history. I had to scavenge what I believe to be the most efficient and effective

918
00:52:30,660 --> 00:52:34,900
techniques from within the martial arts universe. So he's taken every martial

919
00:52:34,900 --> 00:52:38,780
art and taken only the most deadly. That's what I would do yeah, and he also

920
00:52:38,780 --> 00:52:43,420
has unlimited techniques. Oh my God, so unlimited deadly technique, literally

921
00:52:43,420 --> 00:52:48,220
unlimited wow. Here's one of his diagrams. He has I'm not I'm not he I

922
00:52:48,220 --> 00:52:51,940
I've taken all this stuff from only the free samples of his books on am. I

923
00:52:51,940 --> 00:52:54,780
ordered one of his books, a hard copy that I'm going to get next week. I'm

924
00:52:54,780 --> 00:52:58,140
really excited about it, even the free samples. There are probably fifty

925
00:52:58,180 --> 00:53:01,620
diagrams that look exactly like this with this exact density. So for people who

926
00:53:01,620 --> 00:53:05,800
are just listening, it's a human body. There's a bunch of numbers on it. It

927
00:53:05,800 --> 00:53:10,120
says IAA insertion attack areas, and then there's a bunch of arrows pointing

928
00:53:10,120 --> 00:53:14,380
to different insertion attacks, and it's all, I cannot read it from here 'cause

929
00:53:14,380 --> 00:53:17,580
the TV's too far away from me, but there's, I like, there's some of the TV.

930
00:53:17,580 --> 00:53:22,520
It says no shoes between toes. It's one vulnerable area that you can attack with

931
00:53:22,520 --> 00:53:26,940
an insertion attack. If somebody has no shoes, you can insert your finger into

932
00:53:26,960 --> 00:53:30,660
the web of their foot. Yeah, I think you can put your finger in between their

933
00:53:30,660 --> 00:53:33,020
toes and it will cause damage to them.

934
00:53:33,020 --> 00:53:38,380
Yeah, Mario was a system. You be was a target holes. So these are holes on the

935
00:53:38,380 --> 00:53:42,720
body that you can target with your finger 'cause you be was a translates a

936
00:53:42,720 --> 00:53:46,580
finger technique by the way. Okay, so these are the holes you can attack.

937
00:53:46,580 --> 00:53:50,900
What is finger? You was a what is that's the name of his art? Okay,

938
00:53:50,900 --> 00:53:54,380
so Muriel is just a made up word. I think so. Yeah, threat pit

939
00:53:55,680 --> 00:54:00,340
the clavicle pit, you know all this, so you can put stuff on people. You can put

940
00:54:00,340 --> 00:54:03,320
your fingers between people's fingers between their toes. These are the holes

941
00:54:03,320 --> 00:54:05,720
that you can attack with. That's just an example of a

942
00:54:05,720 --> 00:54:11,480
sounds a little bit. I don't mean to be offensive. Sure, it sounds a little bit

943
00:54:11,480 --> 00:54:16,280
to me like tickling. No, no, okay, you'll be completely wrong. Let's maybe this

944
00:54:16,280 --> 00:54:19,720
will clear it up. If we do a little bit more fingers in their armpits and the

945
00:54:19,720 --> 00:54:21,040
bottom of their no, no, it's a

946
00:54:21,560 --> 00:54:26,200
insertion attack. Look, right there, he says, I let it is the penis that was

947
00:54:26,200 --> 00:54:30,440
the most sensitive part of your body. Yeah, yeah, well, it's just and with one

948
00:54:30,440 --> 00:54:34,080
finger, that's all you need. It's deadly, whatever you keep going, okay,

949
00:54:34,080 --> 00:54:37,800
keep going. Here's some of his other book covers. This is the one I order on

950
00:54:37,800 --> 00:54:42,480
the left, Maria was the way of unlimited techniques written and illustrated by

951
00:54:42,480 --> 00:54:47,840
Grandmaster founder, the deadliest self defense system in history. He also has

952
00:54:48,040 --> 00:54:51,840
Mario was a the way of unlimited techniques, arboreal locomotive hands,

953
00:54:51,840 --> 00:54:53,400
body language, projection

954
00:54:53,400 --> 00:54:55,680
and he which

955
00:54:55,680 --> 00:54:58,420
where is this what this book is about?

956
00:54:58,420 --> 00:55:04,180
It's about arboreal locomotive hands and body language, projection, arboreal

957
00:55:04,180 --> 00:55:09,900
meaning trees, yeah and body language, meaning body language. So here's the

958
00:55:09,900 --> 00:55:14,760
first page of his book legend, victimology, noun, the study of the

959
00:55:14,820 --> 00:55:18,820
victims of crime and psychological effects on them of their experience.

960
00:55:18,820 --> 00:55:20,820
That is, if they survive the assault.

961
00:55:20,820 --> 00:55:21,320
Oh my...

962
00:55:21,320 --> 00:55:24,320
As a Murya Wazen, your primary goal, as it relates to self-defense,

963
00:55:24,320 --> 00:55:27,820
is to learn special body mechanical techniques and special concepts

964
00:55:27,820 --> 00:55:31,820
designed to enhance your power, to increase your capacity, capability, and ability

965
00:55:31,820 --> 00:55:34,820
to survive beyond an attacker's primary intent to do you harm,

966
00:55:34,820 --> 00:55:39,820
and do so by eliminating the initial assault and any evolution or progression of the attack thereafter.

967
00:55:39,820 --> 00:55:41,820
Thus, anti-victimology.

968
00:55:41,820 --> 00:55:45,580
This manual is designed in such a way as to enhance your efforts in developing

969
00:55:45,580 --> 00:55:49,920
your own individual specialized TDP total defense plan through hundreds of

970
00:55:49,920 --> 00:55:54,740
unique drawings, secret concepts, charts, medical implications, strategic

971
00:55:54,740 --> 00:55:57,340
body, mechanical techniques and hand contortions,

972
00:55:57,340 --> 00:56:03,100
and I did there. This is he's on some Naruto shit. He's literally this this

973
00:56:03,100 --> 00:56:06,880
whole book this that in the free sample is all diagrams of hand motions. You can

974
00:56:06,880 --> 00:56:11,160
do to stop attacks. Okay, here's some symbols he put in for arboreal locomotive

975
00:56:11,200 --> 00:56:17,200
hands projecting common symbols, ratting back and forth. Where's et on the top

976
00:56:17,200 --> 00:56:21,140
the first one on the no that's a rattle snake. Oh my God, your hands are going

977
00:56:21,140 --> 00:56:26,700
to make these these signs, for example, stop or stop and think or danger to bob

978
00:56:26,700 --> 00:56:27,900
or quiet zone

979
00:56:27,900 --> 00:56:33,480
and all stuff like that. He also has some some warnings here for compromised

980
00:56:33,480 --> 00:56:36,940
organ malfunction and compromised glandular malfunction. It's potential

981
00:56:36,940 --> 00:56:40,280
potentially lethal security personnel related. You can see he has some

982
00:56:40,320 --> 00:56:44,260
security personnel warnings for an tease and these are supposed to go. You

983
00:56:44,260 --> 00:56:47,340
supposed to make these hand motions yeah. These hand motions could cause

984
00:56:47,340 --> 00:56:50,540
compromised organ malfunction, so you just have to know that before you go

985
00:56:50,540 --> 00:56:52,740
into doing the gotcha and here's one of the hand motions.

986
00:56:52,740 --> 00:57:01,620
This one is called what willow branch. These are a branch in the willow leaf.

987
00:57:01,620 --> 00:57:05,360
None of them have names, but I could see it's there's also there's literally

988
00:57:05,360 --> 00:57:09,480
fifty of these. Okay, almost I'm going to do I'm going to do this. This says

989
00:57:09,520 --> 00:57:15,220
that you need to rattle each hand. Yeah, in a kind of a right angle motion. So

990
00:57:15,220 --> 00:57:16,540
you I would rattle like this,

991
00:57:16,540 --> 00:57:22,260
rattle like that and then bring them up and then do this. So try to attack me,

992
00:57:22,260 --> 00:57:23,320
try to attack me, Patrick.

993
00:57:23,320 --> 00:57:30,080
Stop, you're supposed to be psyched. You're supposed to be psychologically.

994
00:57:30,080 --> 00:57:33,880
You didn't even look at my hand. You just punched my chest and I heard a

995
00:57:33,880 --> 00:57:36,480
full way. It says there the message, the front hand is sending the message,

996
00:57:36,480 --> 00:57:38,240
stop and think. Oh, okay. All right, ready?

997
00:57:38,240 --> 00:57:45,880
you. Stop. No, that hurts. I did not. You told me to attack and honestly making that rattle

998
00:57:45,880 --> 00:57:50,280
snake thing and made me want to attack. Cameron, none of this is working. Okay, well, maybe

999
00:57:50,280 --> 00:57:59,320
about how here's my idea. Try to attack me. Okay. See, that worked out a lot better. Here's

1000
00:57:59,320 --> 00:58:03,920
your issue here. I'm zooming in here. Okay. Allow a salient to fixate on your locomotive

1001
00:58:03,920 --> 00:58:08,960
my hands fixate on okay wait. So you gotta do so you gotta maybe say watch my

1002
00:58:08,960 --> 00:58:13,000
hands first, watch my hands. The willow tree gives us hope, a sense of belonging

1003
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:17,180
and safety. Furthermore, the ability to let go of the pain and suffering. So let

1004
00:58:17,180 --> 00:58:20,860
go of the pain and suffering. I don't care to grow new strong and bold close.

1005
00:58:20,860 --> 00:58:21,680
Maybe that's the

1006
00:58:21,680 --> 00:58:24,980
how

1007
00:58:24,980 --> 00:58:31,060
it actually hurts me. A l h puffing and blading coupled with a debt adept blp

1008
00:58:31,080 --> 00:58:34,760
techniques will absolutely and unequivocally convey subliminally to any observer the following

1009
00:58:34,760 --> 00:58:38,840
variables. One, an unknown capacity, two, an uncertain capability, and three, an obvious

1010
00:58:38,840 --> 00:58:43,800
ability. The aggressor will subconsciously react to your BLP and interpret them as an

1011
00:58:43,800 --> 00:58:47,880
overt warning of an imminent threat to their continued health and safety, as well as force

1012
00:58:47,880 --> 00:58:52,280
them to rethink the original purpose for their attack and/or POA plan of attack by injecting

1013
00:58:52,280 --> 00:58:55,840
their emotional state of being with overt uncertainty.

1014
00:58:55,840 --> 00:58:58,200
Maybe I'm just immune to this.

1015
00:58:58,200 --> 00:59:00,800
you might be okay. Let's let's move forward and let's let's talk about

1016
00:59:00,800 --> 00:59:04,840
attacking a little bit. Fucking shit, I'm sorry. Clearly, the defending didn't go

1017
00:59:04,840 --> 00:59:07,240
I'm sorry that it made me attack you harder.

1018
00:59:07,240 --> 00:59:11,880
This is so now things let's take a look. You get to try it next time or he does

1019
00:59:11,880 --> 00:59:16,280
because I've taken enough punches today. Okay, that's that's okay. This here's

1020
00:59:16,280 --> 00:59:19,080
another book. You wrote Maria was a the way of unlimited techniques, the

1021
00:59:19,080 --> 00:59:22,840
different animal fighting weapons and characteristics used in the martial art

1022
00:59:22,840 --> 00:59:27,600
of Maria was a Maria was a twenty animals. That's the name of this. Wow,

1023
00:59:27,920 --> 00:59:30,480
this is his different animal styles of fighting. So if you remember from

1024
00:59:30,480 --> 00:59:34,560
Kung Fu Panda, there's different animals, and Kung Fu Turtle right, he

1025
00:59:34,560 --> 00:59:38,140
has a lot. He has twenty styles and I put in only a few of them here,

1026
00:59:38,140 --> 00:59:42,660
but these are what he calls calamitous patterns based on animal attacks. Okay,

1027
00:59:42,660 --> 00:59:46,740
so these are animal attacks that you can use in Maria was a so first up is

1028
00:59:46,740 --> 00:59:51,840
his first style of martial arts is the great ape monkey, baboon, chimpanzee,

1029
00:59:51,840 --> 00:59:56,660
gorilla, orangutan, spider, capuchin, okay here on H one. He has five different

1030
00:59:56,700 --> 01:00:01,100
attacks you can use okay one eight climbs tree trapping slash control,

1031
01:00:01,100 --> 01:00:05,700
grabbing arms, executing a jumping head, but to eight bites branch biting at an

1032
01:00:05,700 --> 01:00:10,380
assailant's arm with control three eight grips, bamboo stock, a merciless hand

1033
01:00:10,380 --> 01:00:12,700
grip at the throat for hairy the eight

1034
01:00:12,700 --> 01:00:18,780
marching type front snap kicks at knees five monkeys, paw clawless tiger strike

1035
01:00:18,780 --> 01:00:23,200
to face a neck. So that's a style. So this is grabbing somebody biting them

1036
01:00:23,220 --> 01:00:26,660
and scratching their face, yeah, and being harry the ape, okay and becoming

1037
01:00:26,660 --> 01:00:29,620
harry the ape for a short amount of time in the next. Here's the next style. I

1038
01:00:29,620 --> 01:00:33,380
want to look at is badger style, Wolverine, weasel, scum, first one, look

1039
01:00:33,380 --> 01:00:37,260
at the first one, the honey badger grabbing, clawing, pinching, stabbing,

1040
01:00:37,260 --> 01:00:42,240
punching at an assailant's groin area. Number two badger digs hole dirt or

1041
01:00:42,240 --> 01:00:46,540
object, tossed to an assailant's eyes. Number three badger retreats, quick

1042
01:00:46,540 --> 01:00:51,940
calculated running backwards steps. Number four, the badgers mirror ultra

1043
01:00:51,980 --> 01:00:56,620
quick scratches to entire ultra quick this and number five twisting badgers

1044
01:00:56,620 --> 01:00:59,160
clock quick snap back twisting claw list strike

1045
01:00:59,160 --> 01:01:03,600
okay. So if anyone wants to use the badgers mirror, just make sure you're

1046
01:01:03,600 --> 01:01:08,000
this is how a badger fights. Yeah, it retreats and has a dirty man. Yeah,

1047
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:09,560
well there you go badger digs hole.

1048
01:01:09,560 --> 01:01:16,280
Here's the next style the armadillo number one armadillo roll ground attack

1049
01:01:16,320 --> 01:01:20,120
Mario wasn't rolls into a ball by assuming a semi beetle position,

1050
01:01:20,120 --> 01:01:21,400
protecting internal or

1051
01:01:21,400 --> 01:01:27,860
number two armadillo itches vigorous, unrelenting nail, scratching at

1052
01:01:27,860 --> 01:01:31,540
opponents, arms, neck and face during the duration of the altercation.

1053
01:01:31,540 --> 01:01:33,940
Imagine you're in a martial arts, but it was fight with someone and they're

1054
01:01:33,940 --> 01:01:35,620
like next. I'll use armadillo

1055
01:01:35,620 --> 01:01:43,200
number three armadillo absconds, Maria wasn't walks or runs away that hey

1056
01:01:43,300 --> 01:01:46,860
I've been that's what I do every single time. Yeah, Armadillo style fighting

1057
01:01:46,860 --> 01:01:50,380
of yeah number four Armadillo shell block on coming punches with lunar

1058
01:01:50,380 --> 01:01:53,460
punches to attack body weapon. Well, if I knew how to do a lunar punch, I

1059
01:01:53,460 --> 01:01:57,480
probably see that's what I was doing. You were doing lunar. Yeah, I hunched

1060
01:01:57,480 --> 01:02:00,980
over so I could throw in haymakers. I don't get hit in the head. Armadillo

1061
01:02:00,980 --> 01:02:05,220
sweeps tail blood short, stiff legged kick slash seep to the heel of feet. So

1062
01:02:05,220 --> 01:02:08,460
we those are three animal styles. Any guesses on what the next day we've

1063
01:02:08,460 --> 01:02:11,740
we've looked at ape style, badger style, Armadillo style. What animal do you

1064
01:02:11,760 --> 01:02:16,960
think maybe mouse next okay, so you're both completely wrong. The next style of

1065
01:02:16,960 --> 01:02:19,520
animal style we're looking at is human style

1066
01:02:19,520 --> 01:02:25,200
and it says the human homo sapiens, African, Asian, European, Native

1067
01:02:25,200 --> 01:02:29,540
American and Oceanian. Here are the different attacks on the hunter extended

1068
01:02:29,540 --> 01:02:34,020
arm slices under the nose and at wind pipe number two, the fisherman rapid

1069
01:02:34,020 --> 01:02:38,360
severe piston like punches to the stomach. He did that he did a fish. You

1070
01:02:38,400 --> 01:02:42,240
did the fisherman, you did the fisherman number three, the archer spear to the

1071
01:02:42,240 --> 01:02:42,560
wind

1072
01:02:42,560 --> 01:02:49,740
number for the blacksmith hammer strike to the top of the head or side of the

1073
01:02:49,740 --> 01:02:54,260
head and number five, the wrangler. Why do you wrangle and it's wrangler with

1074
01:02:54,260 --> 01:02:58,360
just an are no yeah embrace the individual around the body with one are

1075
01:02:58,360 --> 01:03:01,540
and with another complete embrace with an elbow smash at solar plexus with a

1076
01:03:01,540 --> 01:03:06,000
striking arm circle high coming down to a groin grab while embracing arm grabs.

1077
01:03:06,160 --> 01:03:09,160
the assailants cloth, then pushes with while their hand performs groin,

1078
01:03:09,160 --> 01:03:12,860
squeeze and pulls with an action reaction to dislocate man testicles from

1079
01:03:12,860 --> 01:03:17,460
transition total standing matador position. Okay, so you jump on there,

1080
01:03:17,460 --> 01:03:17,860
so

1081
01:03:17,860 --> 01:03:24,120
with one arm, you grab onto them from the back and then with the other arm

1082
01:03:24,120 --> 01:03:27,040
elbow to the solar plexus, you go like this and you grab the a nut,

1083
01:03:27,040 --> 01:03:28,120
then you grab their cloth

1084
01:03:28,120 --> 01:03:33,600
and then you grab their nuts. You're fighting another kind of ancient human

1085
01:03:33,620 --> 01:03:38,420
here yeah as the wrangler yeah, I'm going to use the wrangler. If you'll excuse me,

1086
01:03:38,420 --> 01:03:39,960
I will become the wrangler yeah,

1087
01:03:39,960 --> 01:03:44,020
so that's kind of an overview of his martial arts. That's pretty much all I

1088
01:03:44,020 --> 01:03:47,700
really I really know about his martial arts from the free samples before I get

1089
01:03:47,700 --> 01:03:52,600
his book in the mail. But what about his arts, but he's actually a complete

1090
01:03:52,600 --> 01:03:56,000
renaissance man and martial arts is not the only area. Everything about it

1091
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:59,900
screams renaissance man. Here's some other books that he wrote. Here's a

1092
01:03:59,940 --> 01:04:03,440
short story he wrote called Prehistoric Birds and Modern Times, and this is a

1093
01:04:03,440 --> 01:04:06,920
cover where it has a picture of a bunch of pterodactyls, and it says Africa, New

1094
01:04:06,920 --> 01:04:11,580
Zealand, Madagascar, Willisee County, Bexar County, the Amazon, Cameron County,

1095
01:04:11,580 --> 01:04:17,200
three counties, Cameron County right there, three counties, two countries, a

1096
01:04:17,200 --> 01:04:21,820

1194
01:11:32,520 --> 01:11:36,920
want to point something out. What do you want to point out? I'm pretty sure that

1195
01:11:36,920 --> 01:11:37,980
the background

1196
01:11:37,980 --> 01:11:45,300
in that Gary's in that video yeah, I think that's I think that maybe that was

1197
01:11:45,300 --> 01:11:48,960
the source film maker. I think this is made in source film maker. Yeah, you

1198
01:11:48,960 --> 01:11:52,480
think he made Vinny and Baldy and source film. This is either source film maker

1199
01:11:52,480 --> 01:11:57,000
that is definitely that definitely looks like so yeah, it does, but yeah, he has

1200
01:11:57,000 --> 01:12:01,520
so much of this stuff. He I am in love with him. He is the man. I credible. I

1201
01:12:01,560 --> 01:12:04,360
I was just going through so much stuff. I didn't want to put too much of the stuff

1202
01:12:04,360 --> 01:12:07,840
in here. I didn't want to burn through it. I think you're 100% right. I think

1203
01:12:07,840 --> 01:12:13,280
that is some Gary's Mod map. Yeah, this is 100% a Gmod thing. Why has he got

01:14:27,900 --> 01:14:32,620

01:14:38,900 --> 01:14:39,900
he goes up and sings Ricky Martin.

1248
01:14:39,900 --> 01:14:42,540
Let me point something out to you guys right now.

1249
01:14:42,540 --> 01:14:44,100
This show, it's pornographic.

1250
01:14:44,100 --> 01:14:46,540
Okay, this show, it goes against our values.

1251
01:14:46,540 --> 01:14:48,980
It's showing these things that we don't agree with.

1252
01:14:48,980 --> 01:14:52,580
And you notice the show used to be called American Idol.

1253
01:14:52,580 --> 01:14:56,020
But as soon as it turned into this, what happened?

1254
01:14:56,020 --> 01:14:57,020
What happened?

1255
01:14:57,020 --> 01:14:59,860
They took out the word American.

1256
01:14:59,860 --> 01:15:01,540
It's not American.

1257
01:15:01,540 --> 01:15:03,420
It's no longer American.

1258
01:15:03,420 --> 01:15:07,860
This is fully a European idol that we have on our hands on television right now.

1259
01:15:07,860 --> 01:15:09,180
And is The Weeknd Canadian?

1260
01:15:09,180 --> 01:15:10,180
And people are finally...

1261
01:15:10,180 --> 01:15:11,180
Oh shit!

1262
01:15:11,180 --> 01:15:12,180
Is he Canadian?

1263
01:15:12,180 --> 01:15:13,180
Yes!

1264
01:15:13,180 --> 01:15:14,180
He's a Canadian idol!

1265
01:15:14,180 --> 01:15:15,180
What the fuck?

1266
01:15:15,180 --> 01:15:18,720
We're finally starting to realize how disgusting the weekend is.

1267
01:15:18,720 --> 01:15:19,240
Uh-huh.

1268
01:15:19,240 --> 01:15:21,560
People are starting to realize what we knew years ago.

1269
01:15:21,560 --> 01:15:25,080
We were talking about eating that damn pussy all the time.

1270
01:15:25,080 --> 01:15:26,100
We were doing...

1271
01:15:26,100 --> 01:15:27,320
Will you let me flick my tick?

1272
01:15:27,320 --> 01:15:29,040
Before anybody even knew this.

1273
01:15:29,040 --> 01:15:30,060
Flick my tick.

1274
01:15:30,060 --> 01:15:33,060
Will you let me flick my tick or not?

1275
01:15:33,060 --> 01:15:36,580
Will you take the tick off my...

1276
01:15:36,580 --> 01:15:40,780
He's saying shit I don't even know what he's saying.

1277
01:15:40,780 --> 01:15:42,100
It's so disgusting.

1278
01:15:42,100 --> 01:15:43,120
Flick my tick.

1279
01:15:43,120 --> 01:15:45,140
What does that even mean?

1280
01:15:45,140 --> 01:15:49,940
Pop my bubble gum on my bubble gum and flick my take my ball

1281
01:15:49,940 --> 01:15:52,240
shit on my balls.

1282
01:15:52,240 --> 01:15:56,740
Shoot my balls, shoot my balls, like my scam.

1283
01:15:56,740 --> 01:15:59,240
I'm bugging got blisters.

1284
01:15:59,240 --> 01:16:01,940
Pick them picking my book.

1285
01:16:01,940 --> 01:16:04,340
Look at my tick.

1286
01:16:04,340 --> 01:16:06,040
Like my tick.

1287
01:16:06,040 --> 01:16:07,540
Will you let me flick my tick?

1288
01:16:07,540 --> 01:16:10,440
Will you let me flick my tick or not?

1289
01:16:11,140 --> 01:16:12,140
or not.

1290
01:16:12,140 --> 01:16:13,140
Nah.

1291
01:16:13,140 --> 01:16:14,140
Nah.

1292
01:16:14,140 --> 01:16:15,140
Nah.

1293
01:16:15,140 --> 01:16:18,380
I'm not going to let you flick your tic.

1294
01:16:18,380 --> 01:16:19,380
But he made a video.

1295
01:16:19,380 --> 01:16:23,580
Please, girl, please, please, please let me flick my tic.

1296
01:16:23,580 --> 01:16:24,580
No, we don't want you to.

1297
01:16:24,580 --> 01:16:26,580
I have a tic that needs to flick.

1298
01:16:26,580 --> 01:16:27,580
Please.

1299
01:16:27,580 --> 01:16:30,580
We don't want him to flick his tic.

1300
01:16:30,580 --> 01:16:34,060
Please, oh please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please,
