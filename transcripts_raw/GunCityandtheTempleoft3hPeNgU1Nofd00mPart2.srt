2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Last time on Gun City, the Temple of The Penguin of Doom.

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Three brilliant archaeologists, Patrick Yoder, Lotos Piss and Ray William Johnson,

4
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:27,000
were hired out of prison by a one Leo the Collector, one of the richest people in Gun City,

5
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:32,000
who is an avid collector of rare artifacts from Planet E-Bomb's ancient past.

6
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:38,000
He brought our heroes via his Sky Galleon to his island in the sky, New England,

7
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:44,000
to ask them to help him find the long-fabled N-Word Pass of the lost Tomogachi Empire,

8
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:49,000
located in the undiscovered Temple of Tepegwin of Doom.

9
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,000
To do so, they will need to need a key into discovering its location,

10
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:58,000
which Leo has arranged the obtainment of by a holding an auction on his island.

11
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
That's a cool sentence.

12
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Auction on his island in which one of the items is up for grabs.

13
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Where one of the items up for grabs, the floppy disk, is in his own little deep hangar

14
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
and is said to contain clues as to where to find the temple.

15
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Sullivan the Frog, assistant to Leo, will be representing the collector at the auction

16
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:19,000
and the gang will have to protect him from many dangerous folks who also desire the item.

17
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:26,040
Whether they are Gerard Depoupou, rival collector to Leo, or Pennsylvania Jim, rival adventurer to the gang.

18
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:36,920
After fucking a couch for the second time, spending a day stealing techno slime percocets from a

19
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:42,440
hospital in New England, and stealing the time of a sales rep at a Brookstone at Leo's shopping mall,

20
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:47,800
our heroes made their way to the events center, where they met the aforementioned troublesome

21
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:54,440
duo of Depupu and Pennsylvania Jim, along with Blowtoss' and Ray's ex-lover Marie Stane

22
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:57,020
and her bodyguard Rex.

23
00:01:57,020 --> 00:02:01,180
After getting right plastered and all that, the fellas settled down for the auction, but

24
00:02:01,180 --> 00:02:06,020
not before taking note of a strange figure in a hood sitting quietly among the crowd.

25
00:02:06,020 --> 00:02:09,860
About halfway through the auction, Patrick Yoda, with his super hearing, heard what he

26
00:02:09,860 --> 00:02:12,700
thought was Jafar sneaking around the center.

27
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:17,280
He and Blowtoss Piss went out to investigate while Ray William Johnson held down the fort

28
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:19,520
to the auction house.

29
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:23,240
Blotoss sent Patrick the Monkey up the air vents where he confirmed the worst.

30
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:24,920
There were party crashes about.

31
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:30,160
Blotoss strategically used- strategically- oh no wait, here it is.

32
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:31,560
Blotoss- I know all that!

33
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:36,360
Blotoss helped the strategically tiny Patrick Yoda up through the vent to learn more, and

34
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:41,160
Patrick Yoda assessed where in the ventilation system the intruders had gone.

35
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:45,800
Earlier, Blotoss had managed to sneak a set of Volkswagen Jetta keys into the auction room,

36
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:48,760
Buying Patrick Yoda just enough time to use Yoda's mind,

37
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:53,240
reading the thoughts of the intruders with such incredible clarity that he breached the language barrier

38
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:56,400
to understand with certainty the intent of these foreign invaders,

39
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:59,340
to steal the floppy disk that lays under the penguin.

40
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:01,320
Thinking fast, Patrick Yoda

41
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:03,760
busted down the gate, the grate of the vent,

42
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:06,980
whipped out his hoverboard, and brutalized these intruders,

43
00:03:06,980 --> 00:03:10,040
beginning a brawl in the auction house.

44
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:11,760
And so,

45
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:13,500
that's where we are.

46
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:14,680
So,

47
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:18,320
basically what happened was is what all the shit i just said and patrick you

48
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:20,160
know just burst open the gate

49
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:26,000
not to those two guys uh... to ninjas red and blue dot yes yeah i dotted them on

50
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,040
the map so you could so it's easier to see

51
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:29,860
in the head and so

52
00:03:29,860 --> 00:03:31,120
the any time

53
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:33,920
and so uh... the hoverboard

54
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:35,120
it's both of them

55
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:38,000
they uh... crashed through the doors of the room

56
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,080
out into on the balcony

57
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:44,440

a

96
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:37,880
You're empty, dude. I hate when I forget that.

97
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:39,880
And let's do this shit.

98
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:43,240
So, first is Blow Toss Piss.

99
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:48,280
So you see these guys fly out of there, they're on top of the balcony, you're sort of on the ground floor,

100
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:53,960
you came out to warn everybody that there were some guys sneaking in the vents that you thought was Jafar.

101
00:05:53,960 --> 00:06:01,160
And they're now up there. So they're pretty far away from you, all things considered.

102
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:05,960
So also for the people at home, I guess to like help give you a sense of this.

103
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:07,860
There are two balconies.

104
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:10,960
There are a bunch of balconies around the event center on the top left

105
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:15,260
floor level two balconies are over the stage where the auction is happening

106
00:06:15,260 --> 00:06:17,760
and the floppy disk is being presented right now.

107
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:23,760
And they are they were in the room behind that balcony.

108
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:24,960
And now they're out in that balcony.

109
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:26,760
So presumably they were going to try to steal it.

110
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:29,860
You can see Sullivan the frog is still trying to participate in the

111
00:06:29,860 --> 00:06:33,960
auction. While this is going on, he's like a hundred dollars.

112
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:37,260
Just like trying to yell over the commotion that's going on.

113
00:06:37,260 --> 00:06:40,960
But yeah, so how far can my character move?

114
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:42,960
I don't have a speed listed on my sheet.

115
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:44,860
Oh, I fucked that up again.

116
00:06:44,860 --> 00:06:45,160
All right.

117
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:47,660
Yeah, so you have 30 feet of movement like everybody else.

118
00:06:47,660 --> 00:06:52,260
So you're 30 feet and then an action or you can use your action

119
00:06:52,260 --> 00:06:54,860
for a move action and just get into or you can move 30 feet and

120
00:06:54,860 --> 00:06:58,260
prepare an action to move 30 feet.

121
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:07,800
to hear. Nice. And I'm going to shoot at the red ninja with my Grinch gun. Hell yeah. Okay.

171
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:54,160
like claymation like opens up

172
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:55,800
and then uh... a bullet

173
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:57,520
comes out of it so

174
00:09:57,520 --> 00:09:58,800
and

175
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:00,560
c_p_ hits

176
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:02,760
and uh... yet he he missed

177
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:05,440
little why do you still like kind of a little rattled

178
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:06,960
uh... it

179
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:10,000
and uh... he's going to uh...

180
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,300
jump down at this point

181
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:15,580
And, uh, what's his range?

182
00:10:15,580 --> 00:10:20,060
And he was able to jump down without any, like, sort of issue, it seemed like.

183
00:10:20,060 --> 00:10:21,580
And he's just going to try to shoot at you again.

184
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:23,420
He got two attacks too?

185
00:10:23,420 --> 00:10:24,220
Yeah.

186
00:10:24,220 --> 00:10:25,540
Oh my God.

187
00:10:25,540 --> 00:10:26,860
What's the big leagues now?

188
00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:28,700
You guys are in the big leagues now.

189
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:31,260
Yeah, that's not fair that they can do stuff too.

190
00:10:31,260 --> 00:10:34,300
And, uh, that's a hit.

191
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:35,420
What?

192
00:10:35,420 --> 00:10:38,180
And he does, yeah, we're in the big leagues now.

193
00:10:38,180 --> 00:10:39,220
You guys have played enough.

194
00:10:39,460 --> 00:10:43,740
I can start bringing out the sexy stuff.

195
00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:44,740
That's fine.

196
00:10:44,740 --> 00:10:45,740
I'm going to start lying.

197
00:10:45,740 --> 00:10:46,740
This is bad news for me.

198
00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:47,740
Yeah.

199
00:10:47,740 --> 00:10:54,020
I like that you think that us having played several hours of D&D means that we're good

200
00:10:54,020 --> 00:10:55,020
at it now.

201
00:10:55,020 --> 00:10:56,020
Yeah.

202
00:10:56,020 --> 00:10:57,020
We've learned anything.

203
00:10:57,020 --> 00:10:58,740
I'm going to start rolling the dice myself.

204
00:10:58,740 --> 00:11:00,380
We've gotten nothing but worse.

205
00:11:00,380 --> 00:11:01,380
Like just strictly worse.

206
00:11:01,380 --> 00:11:06,500
It means to me that maybe there's some sort of subconscious level you're picking up on

207
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:07,500
something.

208
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:08,500
Nope.

209
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:10,180
are getting a no

210
00:11:10,180 --> 00:11:15,500
parade no one who will ever have to attack that this is the

211
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:17,580
and i would have been to attacks the

212
00:11:17,580 --> 00:11:23,540
uh... how to attacks for us and then uh... one or zero every other tax for

213
00:11:23,540 --> 00:11:24,300
them

214
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:24,980
okay

215
00:11:24,980 --> 00:11:26,900
also i'll talk with my people

216
00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:29,980
and i'll get it

217
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:33,260
uh... so he had he shoots at you this time

218
00:11:33,260 --> 00:11:34,380
dot on the ground

219
00:11:34,380 --> 00:11:36,980
sort of like got his bearings shot at you

220
00:11:36,980 --> 00:11:44,660
and you take three damage. He shoots you right in the left shoulder, and when you look there,

221
00:11:44,660 --> 00:11:50,180
you see a red mark on your shoulder, like that seems to be imprinted in your clothes.

222
00:11:50,180 --> 00:11:50,740
Oh, blood!

223
00:11:50,740 --> 00:12:00,500
And now the other one is gonna go, and he runs along the wall over here.

224
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:01,780
Whoa.

225
00:12:01,780 --> 00:12:04,100
That was awesome.

226
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:04,740
That was sick.

227
00:12:05,780 --> 00:12:16,180
and he hangs on to the wall and takes out a couple kunai, which are short throwing knives.

228
00:12:16,180 --> 00:12:22,660
Sorry. You're acting like we don't know what kunai are. I was embarrassed that I knew.

229
00:12:22,660 --> 00:12:31,060
So I was, oh god. All right, so he throws the two of the knives at you, Ray William Johnson.

230
00:12:32,260 --> 00:12:33,060
I dodge.

231
00:12:33,060 --> 00:12:35,860
Hold on, alright? You gotta wait.

232
00:12:35,860 --> 00:12:36,860
[laughter]

233
00:12:36,860 --> 00:12:39,860
You do that every time. You gotta wait now.

234
00:12:39,860 --> 00:12:41,860
New rules.

235
00:12:41,860 --> 00:12:44,060
He SOCKS!

236
00:12:44,060 --> 00:12:44,860
Fuck!

237
00:12:44,860 --> 00:12:46,860
Well, he does...

238
00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:47,460
You know what?

239
00:12:47,460 --> 00:12:49,460
You dodge. How do you dodge?

240
00:12:49,460 --> 00:12:50,860
Uh, backwards.

241
00:12:50,860 --> 00:12:53,060
Okay, you go backwards.

242
00:12:53,060 --> 00:12:53,860
Yeah.

243
00:12:53,860 --> 00:12:56,460
You know your famous moves where you go backwards.

244
00:12:56,460 --> 00:12:58,860
I just walk backwards.

245
00:12:58,860 --> 00:12:59,860
[laughter]

246
00:12:59,860 --> 00:13:01,260
Until it doesn't hit me.

247
00:13:01,260 --> 00:13:01,860
Yeah.

248
00:13:01,860 --> 00:13:08,860
the

249
00:13:08,860 --> 00:13:15,860
the

250
00:13:15,860 --> 00:13:22,860
the

251
00:13:22,860 --> 00:13:29,860
the

252
00:13:29,860 --> 00:13:39,060
of range. Yeah and then he pulled out the 31 foot kunai. Oh he's so smart dude. You see it has like

253
00:13:39,060 --> 00:13:43,380
you see it's like like weights have like the weight numbers on it this one has just 31.

254
00:13:43,380 --> 00:13:48,580
Yeah and it's just like and he throws like two of them and they just like right in your your chest

255
00:13:48,580 --> 00:13:55,220
and you look down if I remember you're either naked or still in your prison clothes but you

256
00:13:55,220 --> 00:14:24,220

257
00:14:24,220 --> 00:14:31,220
and

258
00:14:31,220 --> 00:14:34,940

260
00:14:38,540 --> 00:14:43,740

261
00:14:43,740 --> 00:14:52,460
that now but yeah so now it is your turn Ray William Johnson and actually before

262
00:14:52,460 --> 00:15:03,460
Before you go though, you take 2 damage. You feel the marks on your chest start to freeze you.

263
00:15:03,460 --> 00:15:07,460
They feel really fucking icy to the point of it's almost like a burning.

264
00:15:07,460 --> 00:15:11,460
I think I figured out who they work for.

265
00:15:11,460 --> 00:15:15,460
Fuck dude, I'm at 19 HP already.

266
00:15:15,460 --> 00:15:17,460
Goddamn.

267
00:15:17,460 --> 00:15:18,460
Okay, is it my turn?

268
00:15:18,460 --> 00:15:19,460
Yes.

269
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:22,860
I'm gonna matrix beam, wait which one did you hurt, Cam?

270
00:15:22,860 --> 00:15:23,860
The red one.

271
00:15:23,860 --> 00:15:25,940
I'm gonna matrix beam the red one.

272
00:15:25,940 --> 00:15:31,580
Okay, I will let you know, there's a lot of people in your range.

273
00:15:31,580 --> 00:15:33,420
I think of that.

274
00:15:33,420 --> 00:15:34,420
Don't care.

275
00:15:34,420 --> 00:15:35,420
Okay.

276
00:15:35,420 --> 00:15:36,420
Alright.

277
00:15:36,420 --> 00:15:41,980
Wait, will we get in trouble if he hits any civilians?

278
00:15:41,980 --> 00:15:43,740
We'll deal with that later, okay?

279
00:15:43,740 --> 00:15:45,940
We can explain it to the police.

280
00:15:45,940 --> 00:15:49,380
I'm very interested in you trying to explain it.

281
00:15:49,380 --> 00:15:54,380
So yeah, do Matrix Beam. I think it's a D, I think yeah, I think it might be a D.

282
00:15:54,380 --> 00:15:55,380
I got an 11.

283
00:15:55,380 --> 00:15:59,380
Oh, is it an attack roll? It's an attack roll, it's too bad.

284
00:15:59,380 --> 00:16:03,380
Yeah, an 11. So you shoot out this like, you like put your hands together,

285
00:16:03,380 --> 00:16:12,380
Kamehameha, this like beam of like stupid code, and you, I think is it, let me see if I got this right.

286
00:16:12,380 --> 00:16:13,380
But I'm naked, right?

287
00:16:13,380 --> 00:16:15,380
And you're naked the whole time.

288
00:16:15,380 --> 00:16:18,380
I kind of, I kind of a little bit, just a little make it look like it's my wiener.

289
00:16:18,380 --> 00:16:21,220
Yeah, so what do you do you like to use just sort of point it down?

290
00:16:21,220 --> 00:16:26,020
I just kind of like just you know, you know, you know my hands are I don't know where your hands are

291
00:16:26,020 --> 00:16:29,740
My hands are on my wiener and I'm okay. Yeah, I'm kind of I'm going like

292
00:16:29,740 --> 00:16:36,220
I'm kind of like looking at blowtoss, but in a row, but it'll good but in a robot voice. So what does that? Yeah

293
00:16:36,220 --> 00:16:42,780
Yeah, right like a blender coming and you exactly yeah and

294
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:48,420
There's squid words on the map now. It's a really good squid word. Thank you. Yeah anytime

295
00:16:48,420 --> 00:16:51,960
Yeah, so you shoot that out. It does not

296
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:54,180
hit the

297
00:16:54,180 --> 00:17:00,420
The the ninja he sort of is able to juke it, but it does incinerate that Jollibee. So roll for damage

298
00:17:00,420 --> 00:17:08,160
Swag one of the Jollibee guards who was here. Oh my god. Yeah, I guess describe how you kill that Jollibee

299
00:17:09,020 --> 00:17:13,060
Well, he looks he looks before even feels what's happening to him

300
00:17:13,060 --> 00:17:18,300
he looks at me and sees what I'm doing like kind of making it look like it's coming out of my dick and so as

301
00:17:18,300 --> 00:17:20,220
he's

302
00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:26,500
Incinerated he's like smiling and laughing like his last like getting the joke and kind of laughing and then he's gone

303
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:33,940
Yeah, so he's dead

304
00:17:36,660 --> 00:17:42,360
Three to go a couple people in the crowd are kind of like clipped by it, but they look okay

305
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:45,100
There's not as much crowd area within the range

306
00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:48,560
But yeah, that's your turn

307
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:55,080
And how many techno slime points does that cost for you to let's keep me. Let me check a look

308
00:17:55,080 --> 00:18:01,500
Holly zero looks like it's about five now it is

309
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:04,980
actually

310
00:18:04,980 --> 00:18:06,980
I might be the worst turn I've ever done.

311
00:18:06,980 --> 00:18:07,980
[laughter]

312
00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:12,980
Well, you're actually, you should be weirdly proud.

313
00:18:12,980 --> 00:18:15,980
So, suddenly, this Jollibee who's next to you,

314
00:18:15,980 --> 00:18:17,980
who seems to be pointing at the ninjas,

315
00:18:17,980 --> 00:18:20,980
next to you, Blotas, I should say,

316
00:18:20,980 --> 00:18:24,980
turns around and tries to hit you with his baton.

317
00:18:24,980 --> 00:18:25,980
Me?

318
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:29,980
Yeah, and he's like, "For glory!"

319
00:18:29,980 --> 00:18:32,980
And turns around and tries to whip you with the baton.

320
00:18:32,980 --> 00:18:39,980
on

321
00:18:39,980 --> 00:18:44,620
just started is looking at you like oh and the other one from the back here

322
00:18:44,620 --> 00:18:54,020
runs up and tries to shoot at you ray William Johnson and suddenly you see you

323
00:18:54,020 --> 00:18:58,820
hear a warning warning warning and you hear Leo's the collectors voice over

324
00:18:58,820 --> 00:19:04,220
like the inner the the loudspeaker well seems we've got some I know I changed my

325
00:19:04,220 --> 00:19:09,340
voice from last time to sound a little bit more like someone in particular

326
00:19:09,340 --> 00:19:15,340
It seems that the Jollibee's are turncoats. I don't like that, innit? Oh God.

327
00:19:15,340 --> 00:19:18,340
Caleb predicted them being traitors.

328
00:19:18,340 --> 00:19:19,340
Yeah, that was weird.

329
00:19:19,340 --> 00:19:21,340
Dude, I'm a genius.

330
00:19:21,340 --> 00:19:32,340
The doors shudder all around and you hear over the loudspeaker, "Intruder alert, intruder alert, intruder alert" and all that.

331
00:19:32,340 --> 00:19:35,380
and all that, intruder alert, just keeps doing that.

332
00:19:35,380 --> 00:19:39,260
And the Jollibee, this other Jollibee

333
00:19:39,260 --> 00:19:41,620
is gonna run up and try to shoot you now, Caleb,

334
00:19:41,620 --> 00:19:45,100
with his chicken stick gun.

335
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:47,460
- Fucking slap him in his shit.

336
00:19:47,460 --> 00:19:49,140
- I mean, that might happen.

337
00:19:49,140 --> 00:19:50,500
Oh, he hits you, I'm sorry.

338
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:51,900
- Oh my God.

339
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:54,060
- Yeah, this one gets you by surprise,

340
00:19:54,060 --> 00:19:55,980
doing a solid two damage to you.

341
00:19:55,980 --> 00:19:57,660
- Oh, dude.

342
00:19:57,660 --> 00:20:01,380
- Meanwhile, this one is running

343
00:20:01,380 --> 00:20:06,060
and tries to hit the auctioneer to steal the floppy disk.

344
00:20:06,060 --> 00:20:08,220
- Oh my God.

345
00:20:08,220 --> 00:20:13,160
- And he does not beat the auctioneer's insanely low AC.

346
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:14,900
So he just tries to whip it,

347
00:20:14,900 --> 00:20:16,220
and the auctioneer's like, "Oh, dear!"

348
00:20:16,220 --> 00:20:17,820
And like sort of just, "Oh!"

349
00:20:17,820 --> 00:20:22,300
Like holds his hands to his chest, like Britishly,

350
00:20:22,300 --> 00:20:25,660
and barely dodges out of the way.

351
00:20:25,660 --> 00:20:27,180
But now it's your turn, Patrick Yoda.

352
00:20:27,180 --> 00:20:29,480
- So the auctioneer just took the floppy disk?

353

00:22:43,060 --> 00:22:45,060
Yeah, so here's what we'll do.

383
00:22:45,060 --> 00:22:47,060
The auctioneer's turn will be right after yours.

384
00:22:47,060 --> 00:22:51,060
So, yeah, we can have the auctioneer throw it up now

He got a zero.

392
00:23:15,740 --> 00:23:24,900
So he just like does the thing where, you know, that kid and they try to throw the ball

393
00:23:24,900 --> 00:23:26,500
and they throw it at the ground.

394

396
00:23:31,140 --> 00:23:34,780

And he's like, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'll get that.

398
00:23:36,580 --> 00:23:37,860
And he sort of bends down to get it.

399
00:23:37,860 --> 00:23:40,500
That's what you could try to do in his turn.

517
00:28:46,040 --> 00:28:47,040
I thought that too

518
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:53,680
and yeah the hopefully he comes in later

519
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:12,440
I just like frantically texting Joey like can you change the poster I know it's last second

520
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:17,440
they really want to see snow mice

521
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:19,440
so he's flying at me now with wings?

522
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:22,440
no he's like he has these like tendrils coming out of his back

523
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:26,440
like you know fucking like tentacles kind of shit

524
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:29,440
and they just are flying towards you and roll a dexterity saving throw

525
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:31,440
tentacles?

526
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:32,440

527
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:33,440
13

528
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:35,440
I know how to figure out who they are.

529
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:38,440
Patches, if you had to compare them to any character...

530
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:40,440
They're not, they're not any...

531
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:44,440
Okay.

532
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:46,440
They're not, they're not obvious at all.

533
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:47,440
Have you seen...

534
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:49,440
It's Red vs. Blue.

535
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:51,440
Patches, have you seen Year Without a Santa Claus?

536
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:53,440
What?

537
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:55,440
Have you seen Year Without a Santa Claus?

538
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:56,440
No.

539
00:29:56,440 --> 00:29:57,440
Oh, really?

540
00:29:57,440 --> 00:29:59,440
First of all, that sounds awful.

541
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:00,440
It's a horror movie.

542
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:01,440
Yeah, that's what I'm telling you.

543
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:10,360
I got really scared just hearing that phrase I've never heard those words put

544
00:30:10,360 --> 00:30:14,880
yeah it's it's one of the scariest movies it's got two of the scariest

545
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:20,680
brothers has these two scary ninjas they're made out of clay they have people

546
00:30:20,680 --> 00:30:24,040
talk about the remake but the jab the original Japanese version is so much

547
00:30:24,040 --> 00:30:34,660
better and you are gripped by these like squiggly things they wrap around you I

548
00:30:34,660 --> 00:30:42,640
didn't I didn't dodge it no fuck they wrap around you and roll and this roll

549
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:51,680
d20 okay they got to be bent and aliens was it 10 roll again okay 12 okay you

550
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:58,440
you get a mark on you that wraps around your body like this whole like blue tattoo is kind

551
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:00,960
of around you now.

552
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:02,760
And I'm a Navi now?

553
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:17,480
You take 10 damage as like this searing cold gets into your body and you are also now suddenly

554
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:19,240
seized with fright

555
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:23,800
like you don't even want to come near this guy so you have the condition is

556
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:24,280
called

557
00:31:24,280 --> 00:31:27,720
literally called frightened um

558
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:30,400
and it just means that you have disadvantage on ability checks and

559
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:31,440
attack rolls

560
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:34,760
while the source of your fears in your line of sight

561
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:37,800
and you can't willingly move closer to him. I close my eyes

562
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:41,880
I'm gonna let you try that. Okay. That's hilarious

563
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:46,760
that's literally a good way to like you will still have disadvantage on attack

564
00:31:46,760 --> 00:31:52,640
rolls and saving throws on like ability checks and attack rolls but like you can move closer

565
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:57,640
to him and there might be some ability checks and saving throws that you don't have disadvantage

566
00:31:57,640 --> 00:31:59,760
on because you're not scared.

567
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:02,560
Now you're not scared as long as you have your eyes closed you're not scared.

568
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:03,560
Okay.

569
00:32:03,560 --> 00:32:04,560
Yeah.

570
00:32:04,560 --> 00:32:09,040
So yeah, you just like you got gripped by these things they leave a mark on you and

571
00:32:09,040 --> 00:32:14,080
they fly back into this guy's back and now it is your turn Caleb.

572
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:17,160
Okay, I'm going to use my dong

573
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:23,240
Dongle blade my dong blade and I will attack the red twin from the matrix

574
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:29,460
Yeah, go for it. Go attack that albino. I hit him for fire. I got a rule to five

575
00:32:29,460 --> 00:32:32,200
Is it a twin from the matrix is not the twin from the me?

576
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:37,040
I think is it is this is it chase and Marshall from Paw Patrol? I don't even know

577
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:42,160
It's not anybody that you guys will probably guess because it's to row grass

578
00:32:43,320 --> 00:32:48,920
tell you it's you know it because it's crazy frog and mario otherwise this is gonna be the episode so

579
00:32:48,920 --> 00:32:55,400
here's what i'll say is and they take off their masks right now first of all no

580
00:32:55,400 --> 00:33:07,160
second of all um you they are part of a larger set oh okay so they're not brothers or twins or

581
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:12,840
anything doesn't do anything for me it's charmander and squirtle so i just that's a spoiler for

582
00:33:12,840 --> 00:33:20,560
everyone I had to give make sure the show kept going so it's not Charbander and

583
00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:28,040
Squirtle that's right members of the Miami Heat you make it too easy dude

584
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:33,760
they're they are they are a solid 510 now I'm just more interested in you

585
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:36,600
Yeah, it's okay. We'll keep going

586
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:44,720
You guys have used your character voices once so far

587
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:53,920
Completely and now like enamored and enraptured with

588
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:59,560
Think I hit my my shot really well, though you missed yeah

589
00:33:59,560 --> 00:34:03,320
Okay, yeah

590
00:34:03,320 --> 00:34:07,520
Yeah, where is that guy anyway? He's right in front of blow toss

591
00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:14,500
Are you went on top of him? Okay, I couldn't say I was like, where'd he go? Yeah, so you do that

592
00:34:14,500 --> 00:34:17,400
and it misses

593
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:20,120
and

594
00:34:20,120 --> 00:34:26,680
That's that's you know what I think everybody I should probably give your characters all two attacks at this point

595
00:34:26,680 --> 00:34:28,880
Because I feel like it's it's

596
00:34:28,880 --> 00:34:33,800
Now everybody you should have you should you should be able to attack again at this point cuz these guys are kind of oh my god

597
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:36,400
I'm can I get three attacks then? Like no

598
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:39,040
I already had new so

599
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:44,600
You keep two attacks. I go for the dong lady. You're already like the best one. That's right

600
00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:51,420
At fighting you all have different strengths and you all different fighting also

601
00:34:51,420 --> 00:34:54,640
Well just from like a pure I don't know

602
00:34:55,800 --> 00:35:00,040
No, that's not what I said this happened another time. I'm not gonna play

603
00:35:00,040 --> 00:35:04,600
Take it back. I take it back and camera gets one attack. I

604
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:12,840
Can't do that. Oh fine. I attack him again. I hit all right. I do not hit. Yeah, I do not hit again

605
00:35:12,840 --> 00:35:16,300
Yeah, you miss again. He's always a ghost brother. Yeah

606
00:35:16,300 --> 00:35:21,520
Now it's the Jolly Bear the Ghost Brothers

613
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:53,240
Tell you what if this misses, uh-huh, and you say sold and give it to Sullivan

614
00:35:53,240 --> 00:35:56,920

i turned him into dust

652
00:38:51,860 --> 00:38:53,860
his head just flies up into the fence

653
00:38:53,860 --> 00:38:56,020
it's a bad smell forever

654
00:38:56,020 --> 00:38:59,820

that uh...

656
00:39:00,860 --> 00:39:05,420
uh... don't come to that uh... this had flying indiana jones he was playing

657
00:39:05,420 --> 00:39:08,900
uh... if you still have another attack to another action you can do

658
00:39:08,900 --> 00:39:11,140
uh... attacked it's a

659
00:39:11,140 --> 00:39:14,900
uh... p_r_ no

660
00:39:14,900 --> 00:39:16,180
i think

661
00:39:16,180 --> 00:39:21,620
is there any other psychic damage to that jolly bees ghost p_p_s_ is there is

662
00:39:21,620 --> 00:39:28,620

Yeah, I can't attack that ninja and I don't want to gang up on that one with you guys

665
00:39:36,940 --> 00:39:39,740
So I think what i'm gonna do

666
00:39:39,740 --> 00:39:41,260

669
00:39:48,140 --> 00:39:56,140
Okay, okay look look I I I may I just called some friends I could probably get something together

00:39:56,780 --> 00:40:00,460
I'm gonna take a little bit of time. Okay. All right. It's not something that could happen right away

679
00:40:33,700 --> 00:40:35,700
Don't know the math

680
00:40:35,700 --> 00:40:37,580
Any interest in?

681
00:40:37,580 --> 00:40:43,460
You just turn around from 40 feet away fighting the other night. You're not new you have to put some kind of interest

682
00:40:43,460 --> 00:40:46,860
Otherwise, it's not alone. You know what let's

683
00:40:48,580 --> 00:40:51,780
So let's put a cork in this let's put a cork in this right now and later

684
00:40:51,780 --> 00:40:54,580
Ray is gonna teach me about finance

685
00:40:54,580 --> 00:40:56,580
No, no, we're finishing this right now

686
00:40:56,580 --> 00:40:59,580
No, no, we're gonna tell you, you're gonna tell me about finance later

687
00:40:59,580 --> 00:41:02,580
Just repossess his fedora and his jacket

688
00:41:02,580 --> 00:41:03,580
No!

689
00:41:03,580 --> 00:41:05,580
And for now and then we can

690
00:41:05,580 --> 00:41:09,580
A six month term, 2.5% on the principal every single month

691
00:41:09,580 --> 00:41:12,580
The principal?

692
00:41:12,580 --> 00:41:16,580
The principal loan, the principal loan is $1000

693
00:41:16,580 --> 00:41:18,580
I thought you were talking about the principal.

694
00:41:18,580 --> 00:41:22,580
No, not the- no, there's no- what- where do you think we are, man?

695
00:41:22,580 --> 00:41:24,580
We all- we have a flashback to school.

696
00:41:24,580 --> 00:41:27,580
*laughter*

697
00:41:27,580 --> 00:41:28,580
Yeah.

698
00:41:28,580 --> 00:41:29,580
This looked like the-

699
00:41:29,580 --> 00:41:31,580
Yeah, I just- I just- I was like, "Ugh."

700
00:41:31,580 --> 00:41:34,580
I was in your stairs thinking about the principal.

701
00:41:34,580 --> 00:41:38,580
Well, looks like you three have really ruffled my feathers again.

702
00:41:38,580 --> 00:41:41,580
I'm Principal Bird. You're all in detention.

703
00:41:41,580 --> 00:41:45,580
And, uh, we flash back to a completely different game.

704
00:41:45,580 --> 00:41:50,580
I thought this looked like the multi-purpose room from high school.

705
00:41:50,580 --> 00:41:55,580
This just becomes a breakfast club version of Gun City.

706
00:41:55,580 --> 00:42:03,580
Yeah, I flashback to me smoking so much weed in the library that I scream and I break a pane of glass like a helioestivist.

707
00:42:03,580 --> 00:42:06,580
Okay, I give up. Fuck this.

708
00:42:06,580 --> 00:42:08,580
Yeah, I told you we'll do this later.

709
00:42:08,580 --> 00:42:10,580
Okay, fine. Ten months.

710
00:42:10,580 --> 00:42:15,260
- Yeah, yeah, and yeah, so you go over there and berate him,

711
00:42:15,260 --> 00:42:19,260
and now it's Rex's turn,

712
00:42:19,260 --> 00:42:22,320
and he's gonna run up and try to attack this guy

713
00:42:22,320 --> 00:42:23,280
with his knife.

714
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:26,100
Let's see how he does.

715
00:42:26,100 --> 00:42:27,140
Check this red ninja.

716
00:42:27,140 --> 00:42:30,660
So Rex is running up to him.

717
00:42:30,660 --> 00:42:34,620
Rex does, does that hit?

718
00:42:34,620 --> 00:42:36,420
How long is this guy's AC?

719
00:42:36,420 --> 00:42:37,580
Does not hit.

720
00:42:37,580 --> 00:42:40,140
He's gonna try again with the knife.

721
00:42:40,140 --> 00:42:41,860
and this time he's like

722
00:42:41,860 --> 00:42:42,980
war

723
00:42:42,980 --> 00:42:45,420
which is a screaming now he does it

724
00:42:45,420 --> 00:42:48,100
and he did he just like fucking like

725
00:42:48,100 --> 00:42:49,980
grabs a guy by the head

726
00:42:49,980 --> 00:42:53,300
crushes his skull on his knees asserts stabbing him in the neck with the

727
00:42:53,300 --> 00:42:54,220
night

728
00:42:54,220 --> 00:42:56,860

748
00:43:41,960 --> 00:43:45,300
it's it's the red ninja in the face

749
00:43:45,300 --> 00:43:49,060
so red ninja's things you you like dodging the call for a little and then

750
00:43:49,060 --> 00:43:51,180

751
00:43:51,180 --> 00:43:54,500
it's in just like sort of the jolly be just in his life

752
00:43:54,500 --> 00:43:56,460
and just crashes into the wall

753
00:43:56,460 --> 00:44:00,340

uh... the ending of squidward hanging up in the action and he's a strong

755
00:44:05,780 --> 00:44:10,780
And he's just knocked out right now.

756
00:44:10,780 --> 00:44:13,300
And you have another attack you can do this turn.

757
00:44:13,300 --> 00:44:14,300
And a movement, right?

758
00:44:14,300 --> 00:44:15,300
Yeah, yes, indeed.

759
00:44:15,300 --> 00:44:23,420
Okay, I'm going to walk, yeah, I'm going to walk down, like over to the center of the

760
00:44:23,420 --> 00:44:28,180
aisle and then I'm going to shoot at this last Jolly B with my Grinch gun.

761
00:44:28,180 --> 00:44:29,180

762
00:44:29,180 --> 00:44:31,180

10 damage.

764
00:44:33,020 --> 00:44:35,060
You guys keep getting their exact hit points.

765
00:44:35,060 --> 00:44:42,060
you

766
00:44:42,060 --> 00:44:45,060

767
00:44:45,060 --> 00:44:46,060
yeah

768
00:44:46,060 --> 00:44:48,060
I don't know

769
00:44:48,060 --> 00:44:51,060
yeah you shoot him in the head with a gun

770
00:44:51,060 --> 00:44:54,060
and after that his, so the gun goes into his

771
00:44:54,060 --> 00:44:57,060
prefrontal cortex right

772
00:44:57,060 --> 00:45:01,060
and it just sort of obliterates all of his life functions

773
00:45:01,060 --> 00:45:04,060
and he uh, the force of the bullet

774
00:45:04,060 --> 00:45:06,060
he's still alive, he's just a vegetable

775
00:45:06,060 --> 00:45:07,060
yeah

776
00:45:07,060 --> 00:45:10,060
and the force of the bullet hitting his head causes blood to squirt

777
00:45:10,060 --> 00:45:10,860
work

778
00:45:10,860 --> 00:45:14,300
and he falls to his knees any types

779
00:45:14,300 --> 00:45:15,900

780
00:45:15,900 --> 00:45:17,900

00:51:38,980 --> 00:51:42,380
So yeah, you guys leave the center you go back to Leo's place.

920
00:51:42,380 --> 00:51:48,680
You go back inside upstairs to his study and he has the floppy

921
00:51:48,680 --> 00:51:53,080
disc now and he puts it inside of a he will he bangs on his

922
00:51:53,080 --> 00:51:56,280
desk like bang like you would bang on like a jukebox almost

923
00:51:56,280 --> 00:52:03,280
and it opens up and a like 1997 Dell comes out and he powers

924
00:52:03,280 --> 00:52:07,280
it up and it has like Windows 98 in it and he puts in the floppy

925
00:52:07,280 --> 00:52:14,280
disk. And it plays, what it does is it opens up a link. The floppy disk opens up a link.

926
00:52:14,280 --> 00:52:21,480
I should have thought this through. This is very good.

927
00:52:21,480 --> 00:52:23,480
It opens up a link to a QR code.

928
00:52:23,480 --> 00:52:28,480
Yeah, it opens up a link to a QR code. Yeah. Link to a QR code.

929
00:52:28,480 --> 00:52:31,480
It just takes you to EdwardPass.com.

930
00:52:31,480 --> 00:52:35,480
And Leo's like, "Oh, hold on, hold on one second." He goes to a desk drawer and he finds like

931
00:52:35,480 --> 00:52:37,680
like an old iPhone and he takes it out.

932
00:52:37,680 --> 00:52:39,180
He scans the QR code.

933
00:52:39,180 --> 00:52:42,180
He's like they want me to hold on one.

934
00:52:42,180 --> 00:52:44,780
They want me to enter in they texted me.

935
00:52:44,780 --> 00:52:45,480
Hold on.

936
00:52:45,480 --> 00:52:51,780
He gets the code he puts it in and then the computer lights up

937
00:52:51,780 --> 00:52:58,780
and it shows Club Penguin Island, which loads up and you just

938
00:52:58,780 --> 00:53:02,680
sort of see the the penguin hanging out on the island.

939
00:53:02,680 --> 00:53:05,180
You see Leo sort of studying it and all of you roll a

940
00:53:05,180 --> 00:53:09,180
Roll a straight investigation check.

941
00:53:09,180 --> 00:53:11,180
See if you guys can assess this.

942
00:53:11,180 --> 00:53:12,180
27 dude.

943
00:53:12,180 --> 00:53:13,180
Woo!

944
00:53:13,180 --> 00:53:14,180
Crit 1.

945
00:53:14,180 --> 00:53:15,180
14.

946
00:53:15,180 --> 00:53:23,180
Okay, with the crit 1, you're not sure if this is a computer anymore.

947
00:53:23,180 --> 00:53:25,180
Yeah, this is a window.

948
00:53:25,180 --> 00:53:30,180
We have to get in there and we have to make friends with the penguins

949
00:53:30,180 --> 00:53:33,180
and not start trying to open the computer screen like a window.

950
00:53:33,180 --> 00:53:39,980
Yeah, yeah, and Leo Leo's like no it's not Zoolander very funny get out and he starts

951
00:53:39,980 --> 00:53:44,080
Batting you away, but you ray William Johnson

952
00:53:44,080 --> 00:53:49,740
Since you are of course a computer, you know just attached to a demon you

953
00:53:49,740 --> 00:53:52,100
immediately recognize

954
00:53:52,100 --> 00:53:54,100
What it is a computer?

955
00:53:54,100 --> 00:53:57,100
Yeah, that was no problem for you. I'm a genius

956
00:53:57,700 --> 00:54:02,640
And you also are able to sort of see what it's trying to say use like zoom enhance and your demon

957
00:54:02,640 --> 00:54:05,000
suddenly like is able to like

958
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:11,080
Like zoom in and you you notice in the bottom left corner and very small black text

959
00:54:11,080 --> 00:54:17,060
it says a longitude and latitude of the location of this quote-unquote penguin island and

960
00:54:17,060 --> 00:54:20,780
So you notice that what do you want to do with that information?

961
00:54:20,780 --> 00:54:25,240
He thinks it's a Linux penguin I

962
00:54:25,800 --> 00:54:30,280
Know that they wouldn't give us the straight-up coordinates and

963
00:54:30,280 --> 00:54:37,660
Leo says Leo says what what coordinates are you seeing? Well, you sorry. I'm talking to myself. Can you just let me finish?

964
00:54:37,660 --> 00:54:39,660
Oh, sorry. Yeah

965
00:54:39,660 --> 00:54:44,600
Cheers. Yeah. No, I think that was kind of mean I think what you did, but all right

966
00:54:44,600 --> 00:54:48,560
Take it back man. Yeah

967
00:54:48,560 --> 00:54:52,080
Back down so fast. Yeah, sure. Whatever. I don't just

968
00:54:52,080 --> 00:54:54,080
I

969
00:54:54,080 --> 00:55:00,200
Get up everything in my life recently I've been pushing people away

970
00:55:00,200 --> 00:55:06,360
Yeah, I'm British so we do that all the time, okay, so come here come here, okay, all right

971
00:55:06,360 --> 00:55:13,120
Get real close to the screen. Okay, like really really close. All right, his face is his nose is pressed up against

972
00:55:13,120 --> 00:55:19,280
He falls over it falls on the computer

973
00:55:19,280 --> 00:55:21,280
Alright, are you done fucking talking?

974
00:55:21,280 --> 00:55:22,280
What's this guy got?

975
00:55:22,280 --> 00:55:25,280
Investigate something, you fucking British piece of shit?

976
00:55:25,280 --> 00:55:29,280
He pops his head up from behind the desk and he says, "I know those coordinates."

977
00:55:29,280 --> 00:55:32,280
Oh my god, fine, okay, fine, you do it, fuck you.

978
00:55:32,280 --> 00:55:38,280
"Thank you for pushing my head directly into the screen so I could see them."

979
00:55:38,280 --> 00:55:43,280
And he says, "That's the longitude and latitude for the scope."

980
00:55:45,280 --> 00:55:47,400
now

981
00:55:47,400 --> 00:55:49,280
we'll we'll uh...

982
00:55:49,280 --> 00:55:50,520
bangs on his wall

983
00:55:50,520 --> 00:55:52,680
and a giant map comes down

984
00:55:52,680 --> 00:55:56,280
uh... like all the secrets you got here that lower what the fuck is a bit

985
00:55:56,280 --> 00:55:59,400
uh...

986
00:55:59,400 --> 00:56:01,800
uh... no

987
00:56:01,800 --> 00:56:04,320
but i don't feel like that man

988
00:56:04,320 --> 00:56:07,160
and uh...

989
00:56:07,160 --> 00:56:07,920
and uh...

990
00:56:07,920 --> 00:56:09,680
here is a

991
00:56:09,680 --> 00:56:12,920
for viewers at home showing them right now a a sort of

992
00:56:12,920 --> 00:56:16,240
early stages of a gun city region map

993
00:56:16,240 --> 00:56:17,840
so

994
00:56:17,840 --> 00:56:19,880
here is uh...

995
00:56:19,880 --> 00:56:23,320
what gun city is on planet ebom

996
00:56:23,320 --> 00:56:26,920
there is and and leo is explaining this now

997
00:56:26,920 --> 00:56:29,360
and you guys would know this actually i should say

998
00:56:29,360 --> 00:56:32,800
you guys would know that gun city is sort of a landmass

999
00:56:32,800 --> 00:56:37,960
that was like a bunch of toxic ooze that they built a city upon that toxic ooze

1000
00:56:37,960 --> 00:56:40,120
ended up being techno slime

1001
00:56:40,120 --> 00:56:43,840
that techno slimy that being very very valuable and in enrich the city

1002
00:56:43,840 --> 00:56:46,640
uh... it was like the first settlement on plenty of our the first major

1003
00:56:46,640 --> 00:56:49,160
settlements of plenty bomb

1004
00:56:49,160 --> 00:56:50,900
density also has

1005
00:56:50,900 --> 00:56:52,920
these things called outer zones

1006
00:56:52,920 --> 00:56:54,940
these are sort of like a burrows

1007
00:56:54,940 --> 00:56:59,640
in uh... in the big at the big as speaking my language yeah yeah yeah

1008
00:56:59,640 --> 00:57:02,120
gotta fill in new york in here uh...

1009
00:57:02,120 --> 00:57:03,320
and uh...

1010
00:57:03,320 --> 00:57:06,400
one of the burrows is

1011
00:57:06,400 --> 00:57:08,040
as as scope

1012
00:57:08,040 --> 00:57:12,240
which is uh... literally like a scope on top of the pistol

1013
00:57:12,240 --> 00:57:13,480
uh...

1014
00:57:13,480 --> 00:57:15,560
because gun city shaped like a pistol

1015
00:57:15,560 --> 00:57:19,000
and then they have has a scope a landmass it is a scope on top of the kind of

1016
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:20,480
pistol

1017
00:57:20,480 --> 00:57:21,440
uh...

1018
00:57:21,440 --> 00:57:26,400
uh... i was i was so i mean this is this is world building in real time i was

1019
00:57:26,400 --> 00:57:27,580
envisioning

1020
00:57:27,580 --> 00:57:29,700
a uh... you know a magnum

1021
00:57:29,700 --> 00:57:31,800
like three fifty eight or whatever

1022
00:57:31,800 --> 00:57:34,120
a thirty eight special with the scope on it

1023
00:57:34,120 --> 00:57:36,200
yeah

1024
00:57:36,200 --> 00:57:37,200
Yeah, maybe.

1025
00:57:37,200 --> 00:57:38,200
Okay.

1026
00:57:38,200 --> 00:57:39,200
Yeah.

1027
00:57:39,200 --> 00:57:40,200
Making sure.

1028
00:57:40,200 --> 00:57:41,200
Yeah.

1029
00:57:41,200 --> 00:57:42,200
Yeah.

1030
00:57:42,200 --> 00:57:47,360
And so it has the scope on it, this 38 looking special that is Gun City.

1031
00:57:47,360 --> 00:57:56,400
And the scope is like scope outer zone sponsored by scope mouthwash.

1032
00:57:56,400 --> 00:58:01,120
And it is sort of like a landmass that is a desert.

1033
00:58:01,120 --> 00:58:06,840
But right north of it is this massive mountain and then behind that, beyond that is the frozen

1034
00:58:06,840 --> 00:58:14,120
wastes of soy, which is sort of this like frozen expanse that people don't really go to.

1035
00:58:14,120 --> 00:58:20,840
All around the Gun City landmass is the uninhabitable sea balm sponsored by Stamps.com.

1036
00:58:20,840 --> 00:58:28,160
And it's this sort of like oozy, but it's also smoky, like sort of like unfinished planet

1037
00:58:28,160 --> 00:58:33,700
material, sort of like a gaseous kind of thing that nobody can live in for longer than like

1038
00:58:33,700 --> 00:58:35,800
half a second.

1039
00:58:35,800 --> 00:58:41,400
There's also, there's a couple other places but we'll get to them throughout the adventure.

1040
00:58:41,400 --> 00:58:51,040
But yeah, so you see Leo pulls down this map and he says, "Those coordinates are there,

1041
00:58:51,040 --> 00:58:52,660
Gadsville."

1042
00:58:52,660 --> 00:58:56,260
You guys would know of Gadsville as a a one of the small

1043
00:58:56,260 --> 00:59:03,960
Cities that one of the major cities, but it's a small city within the scope region. There's Gadsville and there's Tuppy Town

1044
00:59:03,960 --> 00:59:06,740
and

1045
00:59:06,740 --> 00:59:09,060
You'll you'll learn more about Gadsville

1046
00:59:09,060 --> 00:59:13,620
As we continue to play and he says what I'm guessing is

1047
00:59:13,620 --> 00:59:20,180
That there's something there in that area. There's probably I don't think that the

1048
00:59:22,060 --> 00:59:26,220
the actual pet temple this day, but there might be something that we need there and

1049
00:59:26,220 --> 00:59:30,500
You guys all you guys roll a history check

1050
00:59:30,500 --> 00:59:33,340
I love history. Mm-hmm

1051
00:59:33,340 --> 00:59:39,540
Fifteen more history. I got a six. I got a nat one Caleb. It's a six though

1052
00:59:39,540 --> 00:59:43,860
Yeah, Caleb doesn't remember what he had for breakfast

1053
00:59:43,860 --> 00:59:47,140
Pat

1054
00:59:47,140 --> 00:59:50,600
Yeah, Patrick Yoda and Caleb look at each other. Don't know

1055
00:59:50,600 --> 00:59:55,600
and uh, and uh, uh, blow toss piss.

1056
00:59:55,600 --> 01:00:03,800
You, you have a recollection from your studies as an archaeologist of, uh, of a, a, a like

1057
01:00:03,800 --> 01:00:10,880
set of caves that are embedded in that mountainside, um, uh, called the land caves.

1058
01:00:10,880 --> 01:00:15,760
Um, I'm having a recollection from one of my studies right now.

1059
01:00:15,760 --> 01:00:27,000
all

1060
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:28,000
touching it.

1061
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:29,000
No!

1062
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:30,000
Fuck you!

1063
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:34,000
You can talk now, I guess.

1064
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:47,000
I'd like to, an officer, I'd like to report a murder.

1065
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:51,000
Yeah, a list of burn centers in the United States.

1066
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:52,000
Wikipedia.

1067
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:56,080
Wikipedia, do you do you mind if I I'm gonna steal that means

1068
01:00:56,080 --> 01:01:02,720
Me acquisition

1069
01:01:02,720 --> 01:01:10,560
Acquisition at this me Mac silence brand and you know all that. So yeah, you remember those those caves

1070
01:01:10,560 --> 01:01:15,760
And and Leo says what I'm guessing is that those caves?

1071
01:01:16,600 --> 01:01:23,880
Yes, and he sort of pours over one of his books and he says that those caves of where the last vestiges of the Tomogotchi

1072
01:01:23,880 --> 01:01:26,080
civilization when they were finally

1073
01:01:26,080 --> 01:01:32,240
Dying out and all that this is where they ended. So maybe a key to get to the temple is in there

1074
01:01:32,240 --> 01:01:39,720
My only fear is that well, I don't know if any of you have been to Gadsfield. Have any of you been the Gadsfield?

1075
01:01:39,720 --> 01:01:41,720
Yeah, like a million times. I

1076
01:01:41,720 --> 01:01:44,800
Go there every weekend

1077
01:01:45,600 --> 01:01:47,600
I've been there once

1078
01:01:47,600 --> 01:01:50,400
Okay, okay. I lied. I've never been there

1079
01:01:50,400 --> 01:01:52,960
okay, so

1080
01:01:52,960 --> 01:01:57,280
This is very funny. I go there every weekend and I just got a three of five

1081
01:01:57,280 --> 01:01:59,960
So I'm very I

1082
01:01:59,960 --> 01:02:03,520
Like the idea of

1083
01:02:03,520 --> 01:02:06,040
One of you lying about going a million times

1084
01:02:06,040 --> 01:02:12,980
When are you going exactly once I want to use like a treats it like you're a fire island gay and that's like you're your hotspot

1085
01:02:12,980 --> 01:02:28,980
So, Gadsville, you would know, especially Patrick Yoda, is a city that is run by the Gads family.

1086
01:02:28,980 --> 01:02:31,980
And the Gad family.

1087
01:02:31,980 --> 01:02:40,980
So they have sort of control over that region, I'll get into a little bit more about what that means.

1088
01:02:40,980 --> 01:02:48,980
But you would also know that they are very protective over their territory.

1089
01:02:48,980 --> 01:02:54,980
And so you see Leo and he says, "This is a bit annoying, I'd say."

1090
01:02:54,980 --> 01:03:01,980
"Hmm, we can't really just drop you in there. Stykems does not have jurisdiction over that region."

1091
01:03:01,980 --> 01:03:06,980
Oh, yeah, they know me there though, so I can just go.

1092
01:03:06,980 --> 01:03:08,680
Oh, let me tell you something.

1093
01:03:08,680 --> 01:03:10,580
They remember the time I was there.

1094
01:03:10,580 --> 01:03:11,780
Look,

1095
01:03:11,780 --> 01:03:13,080
well,

1096
01:03:13,080 --> 01:03:14,280
I already lied.

1097
01:03:14,280 --> 01:03:14,780
Never mind.

1098
01:03:14,780 --> 01:03:15,980
Here's what I'll do.

1099
01:03:15,980 --> 01:03:17,280
Here's what I'll do.

1100
01:03:17,280 --> 01:03:19,280
I'll go to Expedia.com.

1101
01:03:19,280 --> 01:03:21,080
All right.

1102
01:03:21,080 --> 01:03:24,680
I'll book you guys a room at the that's what she said in

1103
01:03:24,680 --> 01:03:27,280
one room.

1104
01:03:27,280 --> 01:03:30,980
Do you did you all want separate rooms?

1105
01:03:30,980 --> 01:03:31,280
Fuck?

1106
01:03:31,280 --> 01:03:32,180
Yes, dude.

1107
01:03:32,180 --> 01:03:34,980
I saw Island you fucking big pussy.

1108
01:03:34,980 --> 01:03:36,080
You're giving vibes.

1109
01:03:36,080 --> 01:03:38,080
I just wasn't what is that?

1110
01:03:38,080 --> 01:03:44,640
Who do you think I am you all slept in the same room earlier, I'm pretty sure I don't remember that

1111
01:03:44,640 --> 01:03:47,320
All right, fine

1112
01:03:47,320 --> 01:03:53,920
I'll just hold on and he goes back on Expedia calm from Windows from his Dell computer

1113
01:03:53,920 --> 01:03:58,320
It's the last time the one time I was in Gadsville. I just want to say I was arrested for drunk driving

1114
01:03:58,320 --> 01:04:00,840
Okay, but I fled

1115
01:04:01,440 --> 01:04:07,700
The vehicle the only vehicles that are permissible in Gadsville are like the scooters that people ride in Walmart. So

1116
01:04:07,700 --> 01:04:17,580
Image flashback to that chase you're going like I am two miles an hour

1117
01:04:17,580 --> 01:04:24,020
This I keep like getting in giant crashes, but somehow just still going after the crashes and just causing another one

1118
01:04:24,020 --> 01:04:28,620
You're in a deathproof Walmart scooter

1119
01:04:29,720 --> 01:04:33,840
I'm in the killdozer of Walmart scooters, and I'm drunk as hell

1120
01:04:33,840 --> 01:04:36,360
and

1121
01:04:36,360 --> 01:04:38,360
Leo says all right

1122
01:04:38,360 --> 01:04:43,520
what let's I will lend you all my sky galleon and my frog here and

1123
01:04:43,520 --> 01:04:49,880
You you can take both of them to Gadsfield and in and seek the favor of the GAD family

1124
01:04:49,880 --> 01:04:54,360
They might let you in if you you know sort of got a sort of you know

1125
01:04:54,360 --> 01:04:55,560
Kiss their feet a little bit

1126
01:04:55,560 --> 01:04:58,640
but then they might give you clearance to go and visit the caves.

1127
01:04:58,640 --> 01:05:00,280
Otherwise you're shit out of luck.

1128
01:05:00,280 --> 01:05:04,800
I wish I could say I could help you there, but even all my money in the world can't move

1129
01:05:04,800 --> 01:05:05,800
the people of Gadsville.

1130
01:05:05,800 --> 01:05:09,640
They're a bunch of, you know, stubborn nonces.

1131
01:05:09,640 --> 01:05:13,840
A nonce, by the way, is a pedophile, I'm pretty sure.

1132
01:05:13,840 --> 01:05:15,240
I'm realizing as I'm saying.

1133
01:05:15,240 --> 01:05:18,120
You can't- you can't just hold down from a pedophile?

1134
01:05:18,120 --> 01:05:19,120
Nope.

1135
01:05:19,120 --> 01:05:20,120
I just-

1136
01:05:20,120 --> 01:05:21,120
After he goes there every weekend?

1137
01:05:21,120 --> 01:05:23,520
I just realized it as it was coming out of my mouth.

1138
01:05:23,520 --> 01:05:28,520
So I'm sorry about that, Josh Gad.

1139
01:05:28,520 --> 01:05:35,920
And yeah, so you guys can hop on the SkyGalleon or you could go tomorrow too if you want to

1140
01:05:35,920 --> 01:05:39,520
like sleep in Leo's New England Island and chill.

1141
01:05:39,520 --> 01:05:44,520
Yeah, no, let's sleep now because I have 14 HP.

1142
01:05:44,520 --> 01:05:49,280
Yeah, so you guys take a long rest in your chambers again.

1143
01:05:49,280 --> 01:05:52,920

1153
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:32,880

01:06:53,240 --> 01:06:55,220

1163

yes yet totally

1164
01:06:57,560 --> 01:07:01,040
okay from fond of a model now i want to know

1165
01:07:01,040 --> 01:07:02,960
we were being sincere

1166
01:07:02,960 --> 01:07:06,680
he sort of looks around his eyes go back and forth and use

1167
01:07:06,680 --> 01:07:09,600
uh... ask them

1168
01:07:09,600 --> 01:07:14,040
And he's like saying it's a really good idea, like nodding.

1169
01:07:14,040 --> 01:07:19,720
I asked them this time, because last time I didn't ask any of them if they'd betray me.

1170
01:07:19,720 --> 01:07:22,600
But this time I made sure to check if they would.

1171
01:07:22,600 --> 01:07:24,600
So you don't gotta worry about that no more.

1172
01:07:24,600 --> 01:07:26,200
That was pretty smart actually.

1173
01:07:26,200 --> 01:07:28,720
Yeah, I wouldn't have thought of that.

1174
01:07:28,720 --> 01:07:32,160
Yeah, well both of you roll deception.

1175
01:07:32,160 --> 01:07:34,160
Two.

1176
01:07:34,160 --> 01:07:36,160
21.

1177
01:07:36,160 --> 01:07:45,160
He could tell that you're lying low toss and he's sort of like like frowns a bit but then he like winks at you a pretty William Johnson.

1178
01:07:45,160 --> 01:07:56,160
My man, he's sort of he says, all right Sullivan, you know, help these guys sort of go to the land caves and discover what's in there.

1179
01:07:56,160 --> 01:08:02,160
But you know, hope everybody I have a safe trip. If you guys need me, you can always call me on your PSPs.

01:08:22,160 --> 01:08:34,160
So yeah, run along now get in the boat and all that and yeah, you guys file onto the sky galleon as you come in and you hear yard matey.

01:08:34,160 --> 01:08:36,460
I'm just kidding.

1185
01:08:36,460 --> 01:08:37,060
You know that.

1186
01:08:37,060 --> 01:08:37,360
Yeah,

welcome to me ship and I just hear that over the loudspeakers

1188
01:08:44,960 --> 01:08:48,560
that like you see Jollibee's like hoisting the sails and like

1189
01:08:48,560 --> 01:08:50,760
it's like they're like hoisting the sails and doing all the

1190
01:08:50,760 --> 01:08:53,660
ship stuff and then just like a jetpack like engine is just

1191
01:08:53,660 --> 01:08:58,960
like actually powers the whole thing and you guys fly out in

1192
01:08:58,960 --> 01:09:02,060
this airship and you're flying on the sky and you start to

1193
01:09:02,060 --> 01:09:06,620
approach you start to fly over you guys are like sort of right over gun cities you're flying over

1194
01:09:06,620 --> 01:09:11,580
you see the toxic waste of gun city in the dark lights and the neon weirdness and you fly over

1195
01:09:11,580 --> 01:09:20,460
these mountains that are between uh gun city and uh the scope you pass through the great invisible

1196
01:09:20,460 --> 01:09:27,260
wall so uh no a little known fact is that uh uh stakeham's promised to build a wall around gun

1197
01:09:27,260 --> 01:09:31,700
city a long time ago. And it was going to be an invisible wall.

1198
01:09:31,700 --> 01:09:34,060
They didn't finish building it. So they just have some parts of

1199
01:09:34,060 --> 01:09:38,380
it that are unfinished, and that people just know, don't have a

1200
01:09:38,380 --> 01:09:40,820
wall around it. And so they're just hoping that people don't

1201
01:09:40,820 --> 01:09:43,540
know. So they have a whole propaganda campaign to stop

1202
01:09:43,540 --> 01:09:46,940
people from learning about the fact that the wall is unfinished

1203
01:09:46,940 --> 01:09:49,740
and some of it is not invisible. So you guys fly through that.

1204
01:09:49,740 --> 01:09:55,860
And you go into now it's completely desert area like

1205
01:09:55,860 --> 01:10:02,660
completely arid and the ship sorts of the sorts of go down you go over the the

1206
01:10:02,660 --> 01:10:06,620
city of Tuppy Town which is just a massive derelict building filled with

1207
01:10:06,620 --> 01:10:10,940
like little furry guys called Tuppies and you go a little bit further north and

1208
01:10:10,940 --> 01:10:16,020
now you can almost see the frozen expanse and it's vast a frozen waste of

1209
01:10:16,020 --> 01:10:21,740
soy and it's vast like sort of a just like ice soy ice that just like covers

1210
01:10:21,740 --> 01:10:26,860
the whole thing and you settle down though before there to Gadsville and it's this colorful

1211
01:10:26,860 --> 01:10:28,700
blocky town.

1212
01:10:28,700 --> 01:10:33,780
You settle right outside of it and you sort of hop off the ship right outside the gates

1213
01:10:33,780 --> 01:10:42,140
of Gadsville and it says, "Welcome to Gadsville where all your dreams come true."

1214
01:10:42,140 --> 01:10:44,860
And there's like an asterisk there.

1215
01:10:44,860 --> 01:10:53,460
And so Gadsville, Gadsville is like a mid-tier industrial city in this zone ruled by the Gadd

1216
01:10:53,460 --> 01:10:54,460
family.

1217
01:10:54,460 --> 01:10:59,580
It is, there's sort of an old world charm to it, quote unquote.

1218
01:10:59,580 --> 01:11:03,460
You would know this, especially Patrick Yoda, obviously, because it appears like a late

1219
01:11:03,460 --> 01:11:10,260
21st century earth, which had all these like muted blues and brown colors and these perfectly

1220
01:11:10,260 --> 01:11:15,860
square parks and roads and boxy shaped buildings that looked almost like Legos, which is part

1221
01:11:15,860 --> 01:11:20,740
of Amazon's planned communities that first cropped up in Duluth after China annexed the Midwest.

1222
01:11:20,740 --> 01:11:27,140
However, there are also tons of electrical wires everywhere, running along the ground,

1223
01:11:27,140 --> 01:11:32,900
running along the sides of the buildings. They're clearly trying to say that we don't do wireless.

1224
01:11:32,900 --> 01:11:38,020
We stick with wired shit because they're very anti-gun city, being everything wireless.

1225
01:11:38,900 --> 01:11:44,020
They want to like keep their own thing. People ride on trams that are affixed to these electrical rails

1226
01:11:44,020 --> 01:11:48,580
that like just have like a big giant bed in the middle of the trams and there's just people just

1227
01:11:48,580 --> 01:11:52,900
lounging around eating snacks as they fall from like these little compartments and then everybody

1228
01:11:52,900 --> 01:12:00,580
else is riding the scooters from Walmart, the Walmart scooters. The Scope Valley itself produces

1229
01:12:00,580 --> 01:12:05,860
the only edible vegetation on planet Nebo. So that's how the Gadd family has been able to keep

1230
01:12:05,860 --> 01:12:11,780
control of the area because they control that. That's probably where Leo buys his food. Everybody

1231
01:12:11,780 --> 01:12:18,860
else eats carbon-based new plastic, but they get to eat real food, which is regulated edible

1232
01:12:18,860 --> 01:12:22,940
artificial lentils, which is probably what you ate, Patrick Yoda, when you ate the Jollibee

1233
01:12:22,940 --> 01:12:26,820
food. That's why it tasted so good. It tasted like actual real food.

1234
01:12:26,820 --> 01:12:31,900
Look, I go to Gadsville all the time. Yeah, and they have really good food there.

1235
01:12:31,900 --> 01:12:35,300
And the one other thing you would notice about Gadsville, you would definitely know, anybody

1236
01:12:35,300 --> 01:12:41,980
Who's been there or even you ray william johnson who's never been there is that what looms over?

1237
01:12:41,980 --> 01:12:46,140
I've been there. All right. Look this I'm the DM now, so it's can't

1238
01:12:46,140 --> 01:12:49,060
been there

1239
01:13:02,900 --> 01:13:04,900
Doesn't remember the name

1240
01:13:04,900 --> 01:13:08,700
Much like the world's biggest computer looms over gun city

1241
01:13:08,700 --> 01:13:13,840
the Gadsville cow looms over Gadsville, so

1242
01:13:13,840 --> 01:13:20,320
Gadsville has been independent from most financial influence unlike almost anywhere else in the gun city area

1243
01:13:20,320 --> 01:13:25,260
Except of course, they have to have at least one person. That is one benefactor in this case

1244
01:13:25,260 --> 01:13:28,540
It's the gateway computer company. And so they have a giant cow

1245
01:13:29,100 --> 01:13:32,340
That is the Gadsville's biggest computer

1246
01:13:32,340 --> 01:13:37,380
And it's the relationship though like culturally Gadsville is Gadsville

1247
01:13:37,380 --> 01:13:41,820
you know gateway just takes a cut of the money and runs to helps run the place with the computer and

1248
01:13:41,820 --> 01:13:45,660
Their Gadsville had one concession

1249
01:13:45,660 --> 01:13:50,540
Which was to have a gad like face on the cow and so there's this giant

1250
01:13:50,540 --> 01:13:58,500
Gad like face on top of this cow's body that stands 55 stories and like the next tallest buildings like 22 in this sort of like

1251
01:13:58,660 --> 01:14:03,100
Short short town like kind of like not that not that tall the buildings are tall but not that tall

1252
01:14:03,100 --> 01:14:07,540
And this cow just fucking towers over all of them. You could see it way in the distance

1253
01:14:07,540 --> 01:14:10,820
And yeah, you guys arrive in the town

1254
01:14:10,820 --> 01:14:14,140
and yeah, you you can

1255
01:14:14,140 --> 01:14:21,240
Kind of if you want to go to the inn you can rent some of the rent a scooter or you can take the tram

1256
01:14:21,240 --> 01:14:23,940
First thing I do when I step off the boat

1257
01:14:23,940 --> 01:14:27,860
I reached down to one of the wires on the ground and I just cut it just to see what happened

1258
01:14:27,860 --> 01:14:33,940
Yeah, roll an attack roll on the wire.

1259
01:14:33,940 --> 01:14:38,860
Okay, alright I'm gonna use my pipe to cut it.

1260
01:14:38,860 --> 01:14:39,860
24.

1261
01:14:39,860 --> 01:14:43,620
Yeah, you dent it in pretty hard.

1262
01:14:43,620 --> 01:14:45,900
Do you do that stealthily or do you...

1263
01:14:45,900 --> 01:14:46,900
Yeah.

1264
01:14:46,900 --> 01:14:49,340
Yeah, okay, roll stealth roll.

1265
01:14:49,340 --> 01:14:50,740
20.

1266
01:14:50,740 --> 01:14:51,740
Pretty fucking good.

1267
01:14:51,740 --> 01:14:56,660
You just roll up in the middle of town, fucking like put a cloak over yourself and just bang

1268
01:14:56,660 --> 01:14:59,460
I got the structure with a pipe.

1269
01:14:59,460 --> 01:15:03,260
And it was I'm just trying to learn how the system works

1270
01:15:03,260 --> 01:15:05,760
and which wires go where and this is the only way to do

1271
01:15:05,760 --> 01:15:09,760
that. Yeah, it busts in and you see the you see the wire

1272
01:15:09,760 --> 01:15:11,760
no longer light up the inside of your cloak.

1273
01:15:11,760 --> 01:15:14,860
You're under I've decided and when you lift up your cloak

1274
01:15:14,860 --> 01:15:18,060
in this town, you see that it goes to like a little center

1275
01:15:18,060 --> 01:15:20,760
node and it has other wires shooting out from it.

1276
01:15:20,760 --> 01:15:22,060
But that wire is dead.

1277
01:15:22,060 --> 01:15:25,260
So you don't know somewhere.

1278
01:15:25,260 --> 01:15:29,460
something something later in the campaign is gonna fail in a crucial moment

1279
01:15:29,460 --> 01:15:32,300
yet maybe that might happen

1280
01:15:32,300 --> 01:15:35,900
i'm not not taking a note of the fact that you just went to this town and

1281
01:15:35,900 --> 01:15:38,180
sabotaged its electrical

1282
01:15:38,180 --> 01:15:40,100
like infrastructure in the second

1283
01:15:40,100 --> 01:15:41,340
you showed up

1284
01:15:41,340 --> 01:15:42,980
i'm just

1285
01:15:42,980 --> 01:15:44,220
looking around

1286
01:15:44,220 --> 01:15:45,400
it's tourist stuff

1287
01:15:45,400 --> 01:15:47,700
it's good luck everyone does that

1288
01:15:47,700 --> 01:15:53,020
so you arrive in the town and you look for some tram operators who are

1289
01:15:53,020 --> 01:15:59,020
who are like trying to get people to go they all for the most part are worms

1290
01:15:59,020 --> 01:16:03,020
are anthropomorphic worms you've seen worms in gun city

1291
01:16:03,020 --> 01:16:11,020
and they're all like trying to solicit you guys to go I mean you see there's a

1292
01:16:11,020 --> 01:16:17,020
rent a scooter and it's run by a Ken Bone type who's running the rent a scooter

1293
01:16:17,020 --> 01:16:32,020
the

1294
01:16:32,020 --> 01:16:38,340
Killed like three Ken bones. Yeah, but those were those were Ken bones not Ken bone. He said Ken bone type

1295
01:16:38,340 --> 01:16:41,020
Yeah, look. All right

1296
01:16:41,020 --> 01:16:43,740
Let's move past this

1297
01:16:43,740 --> 01:16:48,500
Yeah, so what do you guys want to do or you can walk you can also walk

1298
01:16:48,500 --> 01:16:51,020
to the end

1299
01:16:51,020 --> 01:16:55,900
Let's walk to the let's get a taste of the local flavor. I don't think they're gonna let me back on any vehicle here

1300
01:16:55,900 --> 01:17:01,260
Yeah, yeah, and I keep stopping at random like like bus stops and like

1301
01:17:01,900 --> 01:17:08,180
telephone poles like the end of saving private ryan like where he goes to the to the uh...

1302
01:17:08,180 --> 01:17:13,660
the cemetery and i'm just i'm just remembering i'm just

1303
01:17:13,660 --> 01:17:15,020
well this is

1304
01:17:15,020 --> 01:17:16,380
is a group of the

1305
01:17:16,380 --> 01:17:19,820
yes you guys walk walk uh... along and you see a

1306
01:17:19,820 --> 01:17:23,140
uh... as is the custom in in gatsby l

1307
01:17:23,140 --> 01:17:26,260
there's lots of performers and shows being put on you know it's a very

1308
01:17:26,260 --> 01:17:27,980
musical place

1309
01:17:27,980 --> 01:17:30,620
there's lots of uh... uh... people putting online

1310
01:17:30,620 --> 01:17:36,620
live reenactments of famous Josh Gad movies and Josh Gad's progenitors.

1311
01:17:36,620 --> 01:17:41,420
So they trace their origin their their their bloodline to Josh Gad

1312
01:17:41,420 --> 01:17:44,940
whose children and their children's children started an acting dynasty in

1313
01:17:44,940 --> 01:17:48,460
the 21st century that performed in all kinds of movies.

1314
01:17:48,460 --> 01:17:52,620
But so you see reenactments live reenactments of pixels

1315
01:17:52,620 --> 01:17:58,140
and that one that one episode of Party Down he's in he's pretty good in

1316

1322
01:18:31,660 --> 01:18:35,260
inn. You also notice as you're walking along by

1323
01:18:35,260 --> 01:18:37,340
the way, it's like it's a it's like the desert

1324
01:18:37,340 --> 01:18:41,500
has mostly escaped this area, but like it's still pretty like dusty and sandy

1325
01:18:41,500 --> 01:18:44,540
kind of around. It's still kind of an arid place and

1326
01:18:44,540 --> 01:18:49,340
you get to the the the inn and a worm

1327
01:18:49,340 --> 01:18:53,500

Alright, well, go to your room.

1394

What are you, our mom?

1395
01:23:07,680 --> 01:23:09,680
We don't have to go anywhere.

1396
01:23:09,680 --> 01:23:11,680
What? Fuck you, I'm staying right here.

1397
01:23:11,680 --> 01:23:13,680
We're sleeping in the lobby tonight.

1398
01:23:13,680 --> 01:23:15,680
I'm sleeping on this floor right here.

1399
01:23:15,680 --> 01:23:17,680
And there's nothing you can do about it.

1400
01:23:17,680 --> 01:23:19,680
And you see Mike,

1401
01:23:19,680 --> 01:23:21,680
she turns to Mike the worm,

1402
01:23:21,680 --> 01:23:23,680
and he's like,

1403
01:23:23,680 --> 01:23:25,680
"Yeah, there's nothing they can leave.

1404
01:23:25,680 --> 01:23:27,680
It's all paid for, so yeah,

1405
01:23:27,680 --> 01:23:29,680
I guess they can't really kick him out."

1406
01:23:29,680 --> 01:23:31,680
That's right.

1407
01:23:31,680 --> 01:23:33,680
Yeah, you guys go to the lounge,

1408
01:23:33,680 --> 01:23:39,120
So you guys go to the lounge, the lobby lounge, and you start making beds out of the couches and stuff.

1409
01:23:39,120 --> 01:23:41,440
So yeah,

1410
01:23:41,440 --> 01:23:47,200
you guys are setting up the lobby, you're like moving the couch cushions around to make a bed even though there's like a couch you

1411
01:23:47,200 --> 01:23:49,200
could sleep on. We're making a fort.

1412
01:23:49,200 --> 01:23:53,880
All right, I'm gonna have to ask you guys to not make it into a fort if you could have...

1413
01:23:53,880 --> 01:23:57,000
Oh, I thought we paid for it!

1414
01:23:57,000 --> 01:23:59,000
Wouldn't you love that?

1415
01:23:59,000 --> 01:24:01,040
I just, yes I would. I would honestly.

1416
01:24:01,040 --> 01:24:03,040

01:24:18,560 --> 01:24:22,560
You sit with us in the lobby. There's all these windows all around. We'll have a sexy

1421
01:24:22,560 --> 01:24:28,760
Okay, can I get again? Can I have the key to the room? He's a guess sure and Sullivan's like I'm just gonna I'm gonna go

1422
01:24:28,760 --> 01:24:32,280
To the room you guys want no fair. He gets a room

1423
01:24:32,280 --> 01:24:35,280

1424
01:24:35,280 --> 01:24:36,280
Come on.

1425
01:24:36,280 --> 01:24:40,280
Okay, I'll stay here and everyone's right.

1426
01:24:40,280 --> 01:24:46,280
You see Sullivan trying to like, like a dog is like making a bed with his front paw.

1427
01:24:46,280 --> 01:24:47,280
Sullivan, hold on.

1428
01:24:47,280 --> 01:24:49,280
Can I see that key for one second?

1429
01:24:49,280 --> 01:24:50,280
Okay, sure.

1430
01:24:50,280 --> 01:24:51,280
Okay.

1434
01:24:57,280 --> 01:25:01,280
If he's going to be there too, I follow.

1435
01:25:01,280 --> 01:25:04,480

1438
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:16,400
He's like god damn it. You guys walk upstairs. You go to the

1439
01:25:16,400 --> 01:25:21,440
room. You see that it's just like every room looks like a

1440
01:25:21,440 --> 01:25:26,960
Josh Gad fan room. It's just like posters everywhere. There's

And this person, or this V-Folk says to you all,

1459
01:26:33,580 --> 01:26:37,580
"You're cordially invited to visit the GAD family!"

1460
01:26:37,580 --> 01:26:40,080
*SCREAMS*

1461
01:26:40,080 --> 01:26:42,080
*laughter*

1462
01:26:42,080 --> 01:26:44,080
Yeah, that's where we'll start next time.

1463
01:26:44,080 --> 01:26:46,080
Yeah, that's the perfect ending.

1464
01:26:46,080 --> 01:26:51,080
I'll be doing whatever snow does in summer.

1465
01:26:51,080 --> 01:26:57,080
The drink in my hand, my snow up against the burning sand.

1466
01:26:57,080 --> 01:27:03,080
It's all fine and dandy, you know, as Patrick Yoda screams with excitement at meeting the

1467
01:27:03,080 --> 01:27:04,080
Gads.

1468
01:27:04,080 --> 01:27:11,080
We cut back to Leo's Sky, England.

1469
01:27:11,080 --> 01:27:15,240
New England in the sky, Neo-England.

1470
01:27:15,240 --> 01:27:22,680
And Leo the collector sits in his mansion in his study, he spins his cube globe around

1471
01:27:22,680 --> 01:27:27,980
in frustration as he reviews the security hologram footage from the break-in at the

1472
01:27:27,980 --> 01:27:30,480
auction.

1473
01:27:30,480 --> 01:27:31,480
How did they get in there?

1474
01:27:31,480 --> 01:27:36,880
You know, he goes over each moment in the security hologram, you know, over and over

1475
01:27:36,880 --> 01:27:42,960
again circling the image that's being projected, trying to understand what could have went

1476
01:27:42,960 --> 01:27:43,960
wrong.

1477
01:27:43,960 --> 01:27:47,960
It's like he's reviewing the Zapruder film.

1478
01:27:47,960 --> 01:27:52,960
And he spins the cube load around even more in frustration.

1479
01:27:52,960 --> 01:27:54,960
"What do you miss?"

1480
01:27:54,960 --> 01:27:58,960
He spins it so hard, "Gosh bloody dang!"

1481
01:27:58,960 --> 01:28:04,960
That it spins off the axis and thumps onto the ground, shaking the security projector.

1482
01:28:04,960 --> 01:28:07,960
And now this hologram projector starts skipping.

1483
01:28:07,960 --> 01:28:11,960
And Leo, flustered as he is British, bangs on it to no avail.

1484
01:28:11,960 --> 01:28:14,960
but then he looks over at the hologram and sees what's skipping.

1485
01:28:14,960 --> 01:28:18,960
The hooded figure, the one who came in and gave their name as...

1486
01:28:18,960 --> 01:28:21,960
Snoochie Boochies.

1487
01:28:21,960 --> 01:28:26,960
Repeated over and over on this malfunctioning security hologram footage is the hooded figure,

1488
01:28:26,960 --> 01:28:28,960
this one Snoochie Boochies,

1489
01:28:28,960 --> 01:28:30,960
getting up and leaving.

1490
01:28:30,960 --> 01:28:33,960
Right when the attack started.

1491
01:28:33,960 --> 01:28:38,960
Oh, my bloody queen.

1492
01:28:38,960 --> 01:28:42,680
Oh my queen got, oh bloody.

1493
01:28:42,680 --> 01:28:45,320

Bloody shit.

1496
01:28:48,520 --> 01:28:50,600
Hell queen bloody.

1497
01:28:50,600 --> 01:28:51,600
Oh man.

1498
01:28:51,600 --> 01:28:52,600
