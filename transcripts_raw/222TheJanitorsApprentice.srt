1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:13,360
Super Bowl tomorrow. Yeah. How you guys preparing your bodies to play in this

2
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:18,680
game? I'm hitting myself a lot. I'm cutting myself thinking, thinking,

3
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:22,080
thinking will get you nowhere in this game. You got to start. You got to sell

4
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:27,320
fledgling. You think that man, that's what you say. But consider this. If

5
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:33,560
if that's the case, then how come none of these football players on the field ever

6
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:37,600
look completely gigantic like a body builder or like an orc? It's because they

7
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:40,520
have to put some points into intelligence, not just in the strengths.

8
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:41,360
Cameron, Cameron, Cameron, Cameron.

9
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:43,760
It depends on the position. It depends on the position. You have no clue. You

10
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:46,640
don't know anything about sports because you're the nerd side of sports. You

11
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:49,960
probably watch Moneyball and you say, 'Oh, that's my favourite athlete, the guy

12
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:52,600
with the pencil.' I don't watch Moneyball, first of all. You watch Moneyball all

13
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:54,880
the time. You definitely watch Moneyball at least five times in your life. I've

14
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:59,300
playing it three times twice with my dad and once on my nerd side of sports,

15
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:00,880
Mr. R slash basketball.

16
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:02,220
I like

17
00:01:02,220 --> 00:01:06,500
so crazy what

18
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:10,620
that's because we're doing a joke at the beginning of the thing. You don't have

19
00:01:10,620 --> 00:01:16,180
to bring personal stuff into it. I was just a guess. I guess okay. Well, what

20
00:01:16,180 --> 00:01:16,560
do I know?

21
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:22,180
Wait, what do I know about you? We know things about Cameron. I got it. It's not

22
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:25,920
embarrassing to go on hard slash basketball. His tummy hurts all the time. Guys, my tummy

23
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:31,340
actually did hurt this morning because I had my first free junior frosty yesterday. I thought

24
00:01:31,340 --> 00:01:37,000
I could handle the lactose, but it lactosed me out. No, no. Yeah, but it was worth it.

25
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,720
It was worth it. It was delicious. So you like the gift? I haven't had, I loved the

26
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:47,160
gift. I haven't had a full, I've been eating the lactate ice cream. Really? Or the lactose

27
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:51,320
first free ice cream and I thought I liked it. I got kind of brainwashed,

28
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:54,760
but then here the thing I like I have the junior for us. He literally instant

29
00:01:54,760 --> 00:02:00,420
deprogramming yeah. I need it frosty. I had this experience. I've been drinking

30
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:03,840
fair life milk and then I had this and I've been like yeah, it's fine. You can

31
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:07,560
put it in smoothies and whatever isn't isn't on or you're you think of a light

32
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:11,560
life. No, I'm thinking of fair life. I drink it all the time. It's a you get

33
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:15,120
this. It's a milk made by Coca Cola. It comes in plastic. It's very good. It

34
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:19,660
comes in a certain type of square plastic. Yes, and I would say it's a

35
00:02:19,660 --> 00:02:22,920
curvy, beautiful woman shape. Actually, now I think about it, is that kind of

36
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:25,120
shaped like a it shaped like a sexy

37
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:29,280
it's shaped like they're reusing a bottle from something else. You say

38
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:31,680
we ran out of

39
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:36,560
it. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,

40
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:38,680
no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,

41
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:42,840
run of detergents. Yeah, but you said curvy beautiful and I thought that you

42
00:02:42,860 --> 00:02:46,440
I'm talking about that beard, beautiful purple cow that's on the milk. You know

43
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:51,200
it's a bottle. I've always wanted to fuck palm wonderful. Don't know what that is

44
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:55,480
the pomegranate juice. Yeah, it looks like to it looks like to boobs or two

45
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:59,720
balls, but I thought boobs until today and when I thought boobs, I wanted to

46
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:00,620
have sex with that bottle.

47
00:03:00,620 --> 00:03:06,400
The so I thought fair life milk. This is fine and dandy whatever it says like on

48
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:10,080
the thing it says like ultra processed, but it's like it's a good thing right

49
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:14,720
and then I had I made a bolognese. It's hard to make ultra sound like a bad

50
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:19,080
thing. That's right. I always think I'm like, oh, okay, and let's say ultra bad.

51
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:23,640
Yeah, even then I'm like, oh, ultra, ultra, cool, ultra, for sure,

52
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:24,640
acrid

53
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:25,840
yeah,

54
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:30,280
I would eat that, too, and you need an ultra, but that's what I'm saying.

55
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:35,040
Ultra putrid, ultra putrid, wow, ultra putrid, say that five times fast. It's

56
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:39,280
hard. If there's two bottles next to each other at the at the at the at the

57
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:42,580
store and it's one of them labeled putrid and one of them ultra putrid.

58
00:03:42,580 --> 00:03:46,680
I'm going for ultra yeah, if you have it, yeah, it's no contest. If you're going

59
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:51,200
if you're trying to make somebody sick, you want the ultra putrid. I putrid I

60
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:54,480
had a glass of whole milk because I had to use whole milk for this bolognese

61
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:59,200
dude. Whole milk is amazing. Oh yeah, I forgot how good whole milk is dude. What

62
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:02,720
was that? Why was everyone saying that two percent milk is the best because

63
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:06,560
it's the classic yeah, this is the mom mill yeah. This is what comes out of

64
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:12,160
as well. What even is the percent? Of breast milk? A hundred. A hundred

65
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:15,700
percent. No, of milk. Why is it called percent? Because it's milk, two percent

66
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:20,720
fat. Oh. So they take out the whole milk is like... Whole. Four or five percent

67
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:23,560
fat. No, a hundred percent. That's a hundred percent fat. Okay. It's butter.

68
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:27,280
Yeah. So they take out the butter from the milk. Milk can make, like,

69
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:33,740
ten things. Yeah. Milk is like the Swiss Army knife of the cows. But apparently

70
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:39,380
people are now allergic to milk, lactose intolerance, which come, but only

71
00:04:39,380 --> 00:04:42,300
certain populations are like and tolerant, because it depends on where I

72
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:45,340
think it's also here's. The thing also is that it fully is

73
00:04:45,340 --> 00:04:49,220
you. I mean you can get over it. You can't you become like if you're not

74
00:04:49,220 --> 00:04:52,820
eating enough lactose, your body reverts to being lactose intolerant and then the

75
00:04:52,820 --> 00:04:55,880
more you eat, the more you build up. I think you can get over any other. I'm

76
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:59,320
aiming to get over my lactose intolerance with which I've always

77
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:03,360
literally with frosty because I've always been a little lactose intolerant,

78
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:09,480
not enough that it ever affected my life in any way. But then my fiancé is more lactose

79
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:12,800
intolerant than me, so we always get dairy-free stuff. So I have a lot less dairy, so then

80
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:16,360
I've become more lactose intolerant lately. It's time to fight back.

81
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:21,600
I don't think I could be. If I was lactose intolerant, that would ruin so much for me.

82
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:23,800
There's stuff you can still have. You can still have some cheeses.

83
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:28,800
No, I know. Just like in terms of the—I would have to pull out the fucking index card

84
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,440
of allergies at restaurants if I was also—

85
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:31,440
It's not an allergy, though.

86
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:32,440
No, but imagine—

87
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:36,580
you make your stomach up. You've you've smelled my farts in the van when we were

88
00:05:36,580 --> 00:05:40,120
on tour. I tell people imagine the van tell people I've smelled your farts. I

89
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:42,920
don't want people knowing that she smelled my fart on people to tell people.

90
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:46,720
I buried my face and you buried your face in my by disguise myself as like

91
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:50,440
doesn't I would fart in the seat and then I would get out at a go. I think I

92
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:51,460
left something in the car.

93
00:05:51,460 --> 00:05:56,360
I've got lactose intolerance is not an allergy. It's the same level of like a

94
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:58,400
food issue where it's like oh, I can't eat

95
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:03,120
live hamburgers in a row because it will make my stomach upset. Noah said the

96
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:06,740
craziest thing to me last night. He said, "Yeah, dude, my spice intolerance is so

97
00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:10,880
low. I went to Popeye's and in five minutes I ate two spicy chicken sandwiches

98
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:14,120
and I was like sweating walking out of there." I was like, "Yeah, you ate two

99
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:17,160
fucking fried chicken sandwiches in five minutes? That had nothing to do with the

100
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:21,840
spice. That's just a hog's behaviour." That's 'cause you put your body into

101
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:26,320
challenge mode. Yeah, you said, "I'm man, I'm gonna verse this food in the middle

102
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:31,020
the Popeye's at a three PM type of time. I miss doing walk around. I miss doing

103
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:35,040
man versus food challenges by myself. When did, when's the last man versus food

104
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:38,760
you did? Not like man. They should reboot this show with you, because that guy's,

105
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:41,880
what was that guy's whole problem? He cared about his body. Yeah. This dude,

106
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:46,640
you'll go forever. I have acid reflux currently, just because. You'll go

107
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:49,840
forever. Yeah, I'll just. You'll never pussy out like Adam. No, no, no. What was

108
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:53,800
it? Adam something? Adam Rich. Adam Rich. Rich. Fuck you, Adam Rich. Yeah, he

109
00:06:53,820 --> 00:06:59,300
definitely got rich after that show. The food was made a lot of money. That's a

110
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:04,100
good point. Adam first man. Yeah to do a show. It's true. He really heard his

111
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:08,620
word for man and also the first man in the Bible where it comes from. Yeah,

112
00:07:08,620 --> 00:07:12,820
wasn't the first man God. No, he was not a man. God is a corporeal. Do you say

113
00:07:12,820 --> 00:07:17,720
to me he's more than a man. Thank you. God has both parts and he fucks him and

114
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:19,420
that's how you made Adam and Eve.

115
00:07:20,820 --> 00:07:24,720
the chair is a fight outside. There's not a fight outside. Oh, you think

116
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:28,100
everything is a fight or you wish there was another fight. Well, that's enough.

117
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:33,140
That's a okay. We're waiting for the bus. What that amount of Children is

118
00:07:33,140 --> 00:07:38,340
constitutes a fight. What? What? Like after school, if that many kids are

119
00:07:38,340 --> 00:07:41,780
going somewhere, this guy never had friends. Yeah, this guy doesn't for

120
00:07:41,780 --> 00:07:46,660
doesn't ever walk about. You have no friends. You have no fucking friends.

121
00:07:46,660 --> 00:07:49,380
You suck. Nobody wants to hang out with you after school. That's not true

122
00:07:49,380 --> 00:07:52,860
because you fucking smell at school. I don't smell it's yeah. You smell after

123
00:07:52,860 --> 00:07:56,340
school. You smell in regards. You smell fine during school, but then at the end

124
00:07:56,340 --> 00:07:59,600
of school, you start smelling. I've seen you're a pencil chewer. I'm not a

125
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:02,900
pencil pusher. You're a pencil pusher as well. You work at the school. That's

126
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:05,900
why no one wants to hang out with you. You smell back to the janitor. You're

127
00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:09,620
the kid. That's why I'm a janitor. That's my new job. They should have let

128
00:08:09,620 --> 00:08:14,320
kids be janitors for X. I hung out with the janitor and they actually the janitor

129
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:18,740
should pick an apprentice every year. I agree. Just my friends can damn a kid to

130
00:08:18,780 --> 00:08:19,940
the worst fully ever

131
00:08:19,940 --> 00:08:21,080
and

132
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:23,520
they have to wear the full

133
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:28,080
jumpsuit to where you shall be. It should be like the Dalai Lama yeah,

134
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:29,180
where you pick a

135
00:08:29,180 --> 00:08:33,780
new janitor when you'd pass on that is such a thing. That is such an

136
00:08:33,780 --> 00:08:38,820
incredible idea for a young adult novel series. I became the janitor. It's

137
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:41,720
like I mean, okay, it doesn't have to be chills already. Basically, a Harry

138
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:44,540
Potter situation, but it doesn't have to be like it can be a school for like

139
00:08:44,540 --> 00:08:48,300
really gifted magical abilities, X men or Harry Potter or something like that.

140
00:08:48,340 --> 00:08:52,940
so I'm listening and one of the kids he has no powers. Yes, his power, but he

141
00:08:52,940 --> 00:08:56,740
learns he is going to the school because he has to become the janitors of and it's

142
00:08:56,740 --> 00:08:57,440
called learn

143
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:05,500
it's called the janitor's apprentice. He learns that his power is a resource

144
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:09,300
on this and cleanliness exactly to clean up. He cleans up after these all these

145
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:12,300
people with powers, they're careless and by the six about other people, yes, by

146
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:16,140
the book by the six book, they revealed to him like you thought you didn't have

147
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:19,640
your power, but you had a power all along your power was that you were so good at

148
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:22,920
cleaning rose. You were the greatest cleaner of all time, bro.

149
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:30,560
I have bad news, though this is community. No, it's not this happens to

150
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:34,000
childish gambino in community. He becomes the plumber. That's a plumber.

151
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:38,380
That's a different thing. You're kind of right. I guess God is community, but

152
00:09:38,380 --> 00:09:41,760
this is on everything. This is better. This is a different idea. First of all,

153
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:45,680
I was about to get up and leave. First of all, it's high school yeah. Second of

154
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:49,580
should be high school or middle school. It has children with powers and stuff.

155
00:09:49,580 --> 00:09:53,880
This could be like an X men, like an X men one shot. Yeah, okay, yeah, it's a

156
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:57,960
sky high school. It's a six issue, six issue X men run. Well, no, it's not

157
00:09:57,960 --> 00:10:00,940
even that he doesn't know why he came. He knows he's knows why he came and he's

158
00:10:00,940 --> 00:10:04,280
like ashamed of it. Like he doesn't see the value in it. Like he's like he's

159
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:07,800
one of an underclass, but he doesn't know it's only like one yeah, only like

160
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:11,600
point five percent of the human population in America have no powers and

161
00:10:11,620 --> 00:10:16,420
they're called dirties, the dirties, that's a movie already chosen. There's a

162
00:10:16,420 --> 00:10:20,460
movie called the dirties yeah by who matt johnson. Is that a british movie?

163
00:10:20,460 --> 00:10:23,920
It's a movie about a school shooting. Oh, it's called the dirties yeah. It's

164
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:28,340
actually really really good. Well, if you understood you watch it, the

165
00:10:28,340 --> 00:10:32,740
shitties that's a better name for the shitties shitties fuck the shitties, but

166
00:10:32,740 --> 00:10:38,840
then what happens a flood of poop, dirt and a villain comes in dirt. So yeah,

167
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:41,500
well, that's just in the first book. Now that's like you know how in Harry

168
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:43,860
Potter it's like oh the first four books they're kind of fucking around at

169
00:10:43,860 --> 00:10:47,600
school, the fifth stuff fifth book and on it gets real. They're fighting for

170
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:52,860
the fate of the world and to stop another global holocaust. They do stop

171
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:54,500
a holocaust or there were they

172
00:10:54,500 --> 00:11:00,080
they don't stop it got to wonder where they were with the first one. It's

173
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:04,420
revealed that they zoom back. That's basically what happens in Harry Potter.

174
00:11:04,460 --> 00:11:09,820
anyway. It took place in 1942. I think that happens in the Fantastic Beast

175
00:11:09,820 --> 00:11:13,140
movies. I think those are set in the Holocaust. Really? And Dumbledore did

176
00:11:13,140 --> 00:11:13,620
nothing. They are, yeah.

177
00:11:13,620 --> 00:11:17,580
Grindelwald. They're set before. The Crimes of Grindelwald. Yeah. And they

178
00:11:17,580 --> 00:11:20,380
set it there and they... Well, I didn't see the movies. I didn't see them

179
00:11:20,380 --> 00:11:23,500
either. I can only assume what this crime is. I know. I saw the first two

180
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:27,140
in the theaters, and I think the angriest I've ever been leaving a movie

181
00:11:27,140 --> 00:11:32,380
in my life was leaving the second Grindelwald movie. I think it was Crimes

182
00:11:32,380 --> 00:11:36,300
of Grindelwald. I think I was just like that. My ex was a big Harry Potter fan.

183
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:40,220
Well, anyway, this the janitor's apprentice right, the first four books,

184
00:11:40,220 --> 00:11:45,180
they're all it's all kind of just cleaning and cleaning really like like

185
00:11:45,180 --> 00:11:48,300
the first one, it's like oh, maybe it's like we have to clean it. There was they

186
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:52,920
had prom and their solo cups everywhere and that's the big like climax, you know,

187
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:55,380
and then it gradually ramps up. It's like oh, a villain is coming. He becomes

188
00:11:55,380 --> 00:11:58,640
friends with the jock because he cleans up the jocks party. Yes, and he's

189
00:11:58,660 --> 00:12:03,660
gradually to understand it's starting to bridge the class divide between the

190
00:12:03,660 --> 00:12:08,240
cities and the powerfuls, oh my, which is ninety nine point five percent of

191
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:13,580
the population has got the powerfuls. Well, so the cities are really small.

192
00:12:13,580 --> 00:12:16,140
Well, there's barely any of them because it's I mean if there's too many of them,

193
00:12:16,140 --> 00:12:20,240
they'll rise up yeah. Oh, so we may be a find out they're even being sterilized.

194
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:24,720
Oh my God, and that's why there's such a small portion of the population,

195
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:28,340
obviously, and so now the shitties have to clean the world of the powerfuls

196
00:12:28,340 --> 00:12:34,040
kill every last power. That's that's kind of like they're doing that's when

197
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:38,260
we do kind of an i carly reboot type thing where it's like the series ends

198
00:12:38,260 --> 00:12:42,200
and it comes back twenty years later, back twenty years later, exactly like i

199
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:46,500
carly twenty years and twenty years have passed since i carly for now it's for

200
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:49,560
adults and now the good guys do the holocaust.

201
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:53,780
Okay, yeah, this is a pretty good idea. I think

202
00:12:53,780 --> 00:12:54,280
like

203
00:12:54,280 --> 00:13:00,320
they're doing an i carly reboot, but it's for adults.

204
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:05,600
Yeah, and then someone asked them at comic on like so. Why did you decide to

205
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:10,020
do this reboot where it's the holocaust? Have you seen i carly? It was all

206
00:13:10,020 --> 00:13:14,060
currently. It was all hinting towards this. It's all an i carly style show.

207
00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:17,540
Yeah, I didn't see the new i carly. Did you that you were saying like like the

208
00:13:17,540 --> 00:13:22,340
i carly reboot? Well, I didn't see that it could be like that. I carly reboot

209
00:13:22,740 --> 00:13:24,700
because it's like zone of interest or

210
00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:31,180
I didn't see zone of interest. I hear it's good, but it seems like to scary.

211
00:13:31,180 --> 00:13:34,700
She's doing random dancing and you just hear one scream in the back.

212
00:13:34,700 --> 00:13:36,220
Yeah, the

213
00:13:36,220 --> 00:13:42,460
Carly studio was above. It was like on the upper floor of a building

214
00:13:42,460 --> 00:13:48,100
or it's like in the same neighborhood as the move bombing. Yeah, some awful

215
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:50,260
thing that happened is happening right outside. I

216
00:13:51,060 --> 00:13:54,560
they're just barely like you can hear it in the background. If you want to get

217
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:58,960
seventy million views on YouTube, you can make a creepy pasta about this right

218
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:03,220
now, where you edit this stuff happening outside of outside of the window of the

219
00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:08,280
i carly studio zoom into it. You can literally make bank. Oh my God, yeah,

220
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:11,360
because there's like that's a free idea and we're not going to use it. We're

221
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:14,040
not going to do i carly in the holocaust. That's all you a lot of our

222
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:20,000
ideas that we have on this show are most of them. I think probably five percent

223
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:24,800
of them. We hold dear ninety five percent. You can open source reverse

224
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:28,340
that. No, I'm I'm very possessive. Everything I've ever said on this show.

225
00:14:28,340 --> 00:14:31,840
It's mine. Okay, okay, well, then the five percent that are open source, you

226
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:34,720
are allowed to do whatever you want with them and that's one of them and then

227
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:38,240
but but the ninety five percent you can apply for a license. Yeah, we'll give

228
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:41,720
you a license. It's pretty cheap. Honestly, yeah, we don't have that many

229
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:46,840
good ideas, hot sodas and cold dogs that we can you can buy a license for that.

230
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:50,460
yeah, when you can have that one for free, okay, that's a but you are not

231
00:14:50,460 --> 00:14:54,840
fucking licensing janitor's apprentice. No, this is getting written. This is a

232
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:59,160
book series. Okay, so it's ninety four percent, five percent and then one

233
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:01,600
percent of things that we are going to license and create

234
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:06,080
like janitor's apprentice where they should have a different name.

235
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:11,180
Why the shitters the it was the was the shitties and now it's the janitor's

236
00:15:11,180 --> 00:15:15,080
apprentice janitor's apprentice is a good. That's the perfect. I guess the

237
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:20,660
janitor's apprentice is the name of the first book series and then the series

238
00:15:20,660 --> 00:15:25,760
is called something else. What's the boy the boy's name shitly shitly shit,

239
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:30,680
shitly, shitly, piston, shitly, piston is shitly, piston, colon, the janitor's

240
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:33,600
appreciate right now. The first one is just called the janitor's apprentice. I

241
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:38,120
can visualize the cover. It's a mop leaning up in a closet, no like people on

242
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:40,080
the cover. The right class shadow, the

243
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:44,920
my crab. Why villain? There's no villains in the first one. It's just cleaning

244
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:46,360
okay, maybe a few villains

245
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:51,080
or maybe that's one of the superpower. No, it's the font. It's like it's like

246
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:55,280
kind of like a thin, like the kind of font you'd see on a scroll. You know the

247
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:59,800
pirate's apprentice and then as the of course three author names yeah down in

248
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:04,800
the and then it's got and then it's got a circle. It's got a seal of like it

249
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:09,720
won some type of a word like some fake young adult award, the duke, the

250
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:10,220
the

251
00:16:10,220 --> 00:16:16,600
the podcast about list. They won the why a choice twenty four and yeah the cover

252
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:22,160
is the mop is in the closet and there's an open door with a with a beam or of

253
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:24,560
some light coming from outside the door and we see a

254
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:29,400
shadow of the of the so what's yeah silhouette shadow, but then the second

255
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:34,120
book and we make it so that the mop stick looks like his dong and that's a

256
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:38,080
Easter. We have to later there like did you guys know that this was actually an

257
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:41,420
Easter egg for adults. Yeah, that will pop up in a YouTube video called ten

258
00:16:41,420 --> 00:16:46,460
Easter sexual Easter eggs in book covers. Why don't they do? Why is it they do

259
00:16:46,460 --> 00:16:50,080
that with all the kids movies? They never do it. They sneak up. Why is it

260
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:54,220
you're never reading a kid's book and then it says book and then you keep

261
00:16:54,220 --> 00:16:58,880
moving? Why is that or like a footnote like maybe like a tell me you didn't

262
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:03,360
read books as a kid without telling me you're doing a playboy trifold that's

263
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:06,420
like just like a between the thing like a number at the top, like a little foot

264
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:09,680
note and then you read the at the bottom of the page and said this is this is

265
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:14,560
only for adults and in parentheses and then just says penis penis sex. So tell

266
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:18,360
me you never read Captain Underpants before I read it. I did flip around

267
00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:22,840
because that is all for adults. Yeah, yeah, because for kids and for kids it's

268
00:17:22,840 --> 00:17:27,600
it's school superheroes, principals, et cetera, but then all these secrets are

269
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:31,520
hidden in there for adults underpants, professor poopy pants, toilet, toilet,

270
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:35,880
George, booger, monsters, George, a lot of around a lot of children named George.

271
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:38,760
yeah, I guess that's you ever see somebody on the street. You're

272
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:39,800
a little bit of a

273
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:42,100
type of thing. Yep,

274
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:47,100
the crop I used to skip right to the flip around me to

275
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:50,760
go to the flip around and then read from the flip and be like I

276
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:53,540
can't wait for that to show back up. Yeah, exactly. I can't wait

277
00:17:53,540 --> 00:17:56,800
for that. Hey, go to your friends. Hey guys. I made this

278
00:17:56,800 --> 00:18:00,100

00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:08,840
Pilky Pilky man come on. That's your thing of pleakly. I am thinking of

281
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:13,720
pleakly who's pleakly from you don't know pleakly. Pleakly will also be doing a

282
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:14,800
crossover appearance.

283
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:20,400
I feel like a fucking douche bag. Who the hell is pleakly? You know pleakly

284
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:25,560

285
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:29,680
listening, please, pleakly always dressing like a woman. He has but one

286
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:31,360
eye Cyclops

287
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:37,360
Cyclops that's what they call that if I saw a woman with one eye like this in

288
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:41,260
public, I would just I'd probably just shout and three fingers. If you saw a

289
00:18:41,260 --> 00:18:42,880
woman with one eye, you'd shout at her.

290
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:45,560
That's what you said. Stop it.

291
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:52,080
I know, I know, I know you're in disguise. Yep. I know. Okay, please.

292
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:54,440
Clearly, I know you're an alien. Hello, please.

293
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:59,760
Anybody with one eye, you ever known anybody with one eye? No, my cousin had

294
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:04,700
one eye or my he's like my second cousin had one eye. So he got another one later.

295
00:19:04,700 --> 00:19:05,800
No, I think he passed.

296
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:09,800
I'm sorry. Yeah, it's okay. He was much older than me and he lost his eye in a

297
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:11,000
motorcycle accident.

298
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,800
But he nobody

299
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:17,400
he wouldn't tell anybody that I had two family members who had one. I actually my

300
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:22,800
great grandpa had one eye from shooting a tree with another pirate gun and the BB

301
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:26,000
gun came back and took his eye. Your grandpa, I've been black. I'm from a long

302
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:30,700
a lineage of pirates. I've been deeply obsessed and with forming a connection

303
00:19:30,700 --> 00:19:35,500
with my great great grandfather, Peter Fetter. How are we going to do this? I

304
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:38,080
have been, I listen to music and I look at a picture of him.

305
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:43,140
That's some cloud, whatever I'm listening to at the time, but I want to

306
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:45,680
meet him. Cloud Atlas. Do you want to see him? We have a Ouija board, don't we?

307
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:47,940
Did I show you one before? Show me that picture. Peter Fetter. Show me Peter

308
00:19:47,940 --> 00:19:50,860
Fetter. Oh wait, we do have a Ouija board. Isn't that a great name? We do

309
00:19:50,860 --> 00:19:54,000
have a Ouija board. Peter Fetter. It'd be better if it was Petter Fetter. Ouija

310
00:19:54,020 --> 00:19:57,220
forward is like what I wanted to want him turned to a demon or something.

311
00:19:57,220 --> 00:20:00,580
Yeah, it doesn't turn you into it. He's either a demon or he's not. You get you

312
00:20:00,580 --> 00:20:03,300
get sucked up, but I could be a demon that pretend you're thinking of you.

313
00:20:03,300 --> 00:20:07,700
Don't you think that me and him would sash so hard? Yeah, God, Danny, Peter

314
00:20:07,700 --> 00:20:11,740
better doesn't he look good as fuck God damn show the camera. He looks like the

315
00:20:11,740 --> 00:20:12,300
Pringles.

316
00:20:12,300 --> 00:20:15,700
You're the heir to the Pringle. Oh, my God,

317
00:20:15,700 --> 00:20:20,660
that's why you're so rich. Wait a minute. He has think of an energy to him. He

318
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:24,540
because he I will say name ship is this what got you in the gym as you saw how

319
00:20:24,540 --> 00:20:29,840
wide he was now. He said I need to be this with he. I think it looks like he

320
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:34,040
is blown up with air. That's that's more than yeah from eating potato. It does

321
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:38,560
look like he has fake arms on this. This is the this is the basis for the

322
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:42,040
Pringles guy, his wife listen, no disrespect, she's a dog.

323
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:46,800
Your great great great great grandma was a complete dog.

324
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:54,000
Well Peter Fetter, if I ever do get to meet you in a dream or in some type of

325
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,480
vortex, I think that

326
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:59,900
you really would like me. Can I see your grandma? What I would do was doing with

327
00:20:59,900 --> 00:21:03,960
my life and why it's normal to be like I am. I didn't get a good show him show

328
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:06,060
him your grandma one more time. Why are you scared to show?

329
00:21:06,060 --> 00:21:10,280
I was in the middle of talking to my Graham great great grandpa. He has a

330
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:11,160
coconut head.

331
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:13,560
This haircut,

332
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:15,720
what's wrong with the haircut?

333
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:21,560
that's my great great grandma. You're talking about watch it dude. I mean I

334
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:24,360
don't know what else to say about you mean she's beautiful. I

335
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:28,840
you see the resemblance

336
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:31,160
that's horrible.

337
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:36,160
She's passed on. She looks like they were about to put plan of the apes

338
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:36,760
make up on

339
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:41,880
you can't say this. That's my great great grandma looks like she's halfway

340
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:46,360
through a plan of the apes. Yes, she looks like an anamorph second to last

341
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:46,960
anamorph

342
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:51,600
she does not look good man. You're trying to tell me that your grandma was fire,

343
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:55,440
your great great grandma, you're trying to tell me she's fire. You know she

344
00:21:55,440 --> 00:22:00,260
kicked Peter Fetter to the curb day. He was a womanizer. I would hope so with

345
00:22:00,260 --> 00:22:04,060
that fucking wife at home used to he used to blow his entire paycheck on is

346
00:22:04,060 --> 00:22:07,920
that way and food and women is that why she looks like that he womanized her. He

347
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:12,240
womanized her. Oh my God, I was probably trying to he probably just used her hair

348
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:16,200
as storage. She was probably just using her. Yes, he thought that he thought that

349
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:19,700
he was a bowl. Yeah, you know guys in a hundred years, people are going to look

350
00:22:19,700 --> 00:22:20,860
back at us and think the same

351
00:22:20,860 --> 00:22:25,980
the same thing. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, it's so funny to imagine going to

352
00:22:25,980 --> 00:22:30,380
the salon and getting that haircut. Get it, give me give me the give me the

353
00:22:30,380 --> 00:22:32,080
rumple stilt skin from Shrek for

354
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:37,720
there. This is like the hot haircut. This is like this is like the the bus and

355
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:43,660
zoomer haircut of the the nine tens, just a big just putting like the stickiest

356
00:22:43,700 --> 00:22:47,460
it like pine tar in your hair. So it all stays in a job. Have you ever thought

357
00:22:47,460 --> 00:22:50,840
about your kids, your grandkids, your great great grandkids? This will be

358
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:55,300
available to them. Yeah, yeah, I think about that more about my kids than my

359
00:22:55,300 --> 00:22:58,620
great great grand. Luckily, they were my great great kids. I'll be speaking

360
00:22:58,620 --> 00:23:01,620
Spanish yeah, and so they will understand any of this. What I'm just

361
00:23:01,620 --> 00:23:04,900
thinking about now about this picture to about this hairstyle is that picture

362
00:23:04,900 --> 00:23:08,500
they, especially since you're saying this to pick pictures are they're not

363
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:12,900
just like taking a picture. This is like a they're like this is a once in a

364
00:23:12,940 --> 00:23:16,500
lifetime. It's like we're taking our fifty cents. It's like this is our

365
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:19,800
picture, so this that what they're they're get up that's like they're like

366
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:23,380
they're like prepping that for like a week. This is the best we need to get my

367
00:23:23,380 --> 00:23:27,020
hair done for this picture. I need to get these clothes. I need to need to

368
00:23:27,020 --> 00:23:30,860
and essentially I forgot to smile. The only reason why you would get a picture

369
00:23:30,860 --> 00:23:34,980
was to prove that you existed. Yeah, I knew that the picture came out and it

370
00:23:34,980 --> 00:23:38,180
was just proof that you used to exist. So they didn't there was no reason to

371
00:23:38,220 --> 00:23:40,080
mile. Yeah, they were from Latvia,

372
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:45,460
immigrants from Latvia, okay, reminder to never go to Latvia, because the ugly

373
00:23:45,460 --> 00:23:45,820
women,

374
00:23:45,820 --> 00:23:49,740
she literally does look

375
00:23:49,740 --> 00:23:54,060
you're not even looking at her. How can I know that a perfect mental? What if

376
00:23:54,060 --> 00:23:57,820
you look again and you forgot when you were you again and you can't believe

377
00:23:57,820 --> 00:23:59,620
how beautiful she is. I'll show you what she looks like.

378
00:23:59,620 --> 00:24:04,820
She looks really, really as we're not that white. No, her. She really didn't

379
00:24:04,840 --> 00:24:10,440
look like she could see like this. She had a teacher type of yeah, look yeah, you

380
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:14,860
know she looks like the wayside teacher from wayside school, the evil one looks

381
00:24:14,860 --> 00:24:20,160
like she weighs the same as a side of an apple. This is gorgia, this is gorgia.

382
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:23,820
That's crazy. You remember Mrs. Gordon and how did she pass crazy? You remember

383
00:24:23,820 --> 00:24:26,560
her to I remember the one who brought her attributes. I don't remember her

384
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:30,240
name. Mrs. Gorf. It's frog backwards. Oh my God, you're right turns into a frog.

385
00:24:30,260 --> 00:24:32,260
How did she pass away?

386
00:24:32,260 --> 00:24:34,260
I don't know.

387
00:24:34,260 --> 00:24:36,260
Jack the Ripper.

388
00:24:36,260 --> 00:24:38,260
They're not buried together.

389
00:24:38,260 --> 00:24:40,260
Whoa!

390
00:24:40,260 --> 00:24:42,260
But they lived in...

391
00:24:42,260 --> 00:24:44,260
Whose choice was that?

392
00:24:44,260 --> 00:24:46,260
Probably hers, because like I said, she kicked him in the curb.

393
00:24:46,260 --> 00:24:48,260
And how did he fare on the curb?

394
00:24:48,260 --> 00:24:50,260
He probably lived outside on the curb.

395
00:24:50,260 --> 00:24:52,260
Just sitting there.

396
00:24:52,260 --> 00:24:54,260
You had a hobo grandpa?

397
00:24:54,260 --> 00:24:56,260
Kick to the curb is an expression.

398
00:24:56,260 --> 00:24:58,260
I do like the idea that he did live

399
00:24:58,260 --> 00:25:03,460
did live on the curb just like that right outside the house. Just like well,

400
00:25:03,460 --> 00:25:04,340
well,

401
00:25:04,340 --> 00:25:07,000
back then you could fully live

402
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:12,060
on the on the curb. Yeah, you could live a hobo. That was like a normal. That

403
00:25:12,060 --> 00:25:15,180
was the golden era. That was before that. Oh yeah. Back then hobos would walk

404
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:17,420
around wearing suits. Yeah, actually,

405
00:25:17,420 --> 00:25:24,860
it's so funny. Most hobos were better dressed than most CEOs now. Yeah, shoes

406
00:25:25,060 --> 00:25:28,860
say could I bother you to come in and eat a meal with your family, please well

407
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:34,020
sure well sure sure I don't see why not honk honk your hobo. They all had like

408
00:25:34,020 --> 00:25:37,900
the wooden sole shoes to like no shoes back then were comfortable. West

409
00:25:37,900 --> 00:25:40,540
Shocks, wooden shoes are actually supposedly very comfortable clogs,

410
00:25:40,540 --> 00:25:44,580
wooden clogs. I don't agree with it. Okay, let's wear them some doctor until

411
00:25:44,580 --> 00:25:48,900
doctor shoal came around. He is a doctor wood. He is buried in Ros or his

412
00:25:48,900 --> 00:25:53,740
girlfriend is from Roslindale. Where's Roslindale in Massachusetts and they

413
00:25:53,740 --> 00:25:59,140
lived in, I think West Roxbury. Whoa wait, what if you find out that deep roots

414
00:25:59,140 --> 00:26:01,180
yeah, but you find out that his like

415
00:26:01,180 --> 00:26:07,260
like great great grandson or something is like Maurice star, the guy who found

416
00:26:07,260 --> 00:26:11,520
new great greats on me. No, no guy before you got two guys before you, so

417
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:15,660
his dad, my dad, I don't understand what you're saying, okay, but he got kicked

418
00:26:15,660 --> 00:26:19,900
to the curb right right. Oh, you're saying I have like a half you're like I

419
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:24,480
a Herbert Powell. Oh, you might have a I watched that episode last night,

420
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:27,880
actually, I have and I was thinking about having about how incredible it

421
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:32,320
would be to have a half half brother that you don't know about. You could you

422
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:36,880
could have I want a long lost brother so badly. Man crazy. Wouldn't it be insane?

423
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:39,320
I was thinking about the can you imagine I feel like my brain would

424
00:26:39,320 --> 00:26:43,240
instantly break to meet somebody who I've never met before my life who looks

425
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:46,600
like me and you instantly love them. I know and you hug them. How amazing is

426
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:50,900
that wouldn't it suck to not fuck with them at all? I know that's like and it's

427
00:26:50,900 --> 00:26:53,400
like yeah, you meet them and you don't fuck with them at all. They suck and

428
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:56,500
then you're like oh this guy's walking around with my face. Yeah, I've been

429
00:26:56,500 --> 00:27:00,400
with like some second cousins on my dad's side that you don't like. Well, I

430
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:04,160
think I got along with them, but like my older brother just did not fuck with

431
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:07,440
them at all. Like we like met it like some family reunion thing when I was

432
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:10,680
eight. My older brother was just like I don't like these guys. They have a

433
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:13,600
different favorite color than you. Yeah, exactly. That would hurt my heart. More

434
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:18,440
toys. Yeah, more toys, the richer. More toys, damn. I think it's possible that I'm not my

435
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:24,620
father's son. Yeah? Yeah, my brothers both look like him and it's possible that my mom

436
00:27:24,620 --> 00:27:32,040
philandered and found her way into having intercourse with some kind of great man and

437
00:27:32,040 --> 00:27:40,100
produced me. Trixie Mattel. Trixie Mattel, who else? Mr. Clean. Mr. Clean, some of the

438
00:27:40,100 --> 00:27:43,460
the most amazing men who've ever lived that changed the world forever, more so

439
00:27:43,460 --> 00:27:45,300
than anybody in your family ever has. So

440
00:27:45,300 --> 00:27:51,500
on my mom's side, I'm related to the woman who invented Christian science.

441
00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:55,980
Really? Yeah, that's an odd or what's that? What it's called? What's the one

442
00:27:55,980 --> 00:27:59,100
where they don't go to the doctor? Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's an interesting

443
00:27:59,100 --> 00:28:03,820
religion, because they have a whole they have like a whole tower in Boston. Yeah,

444
00:28:03,820 --> 00:28:08,060
they're very cool, yeah, and they don't believe died, I think, because she broke

445
00:28:08,100 --> 00:28:13,460
a leg and didn't go to the doctor. I think that's why our boy from Top Gun is going so

446
00:28:13,460 --> 00:28:20,660
badly. Who? What's his name? Tom Cruise? No, the other guy. Can't talk anymore. Oh, Val

447
00:28:20,660 --> 00:28:24,300
Kilmer. Val Kilmer's Christian Science. Oh, no way. Is he still alive? Yeah, he's still

448
00:28:24,300 --> 00:28:29,180
alive. I thought he was dead. No, he got the Ebert thing going on. Yeah, he got no mouth.

449
00:28:29,180 --> 00:28:33,620
He looks fucked up in the Top Gun movie. He's got a mouth, but it don't work. Yeah. It's

450
00:28:33,620 --> 00:28:35,980
straight up don't work. He's Christian Scientist? Yeah, he's Christian Scientist. I should hit

451
00:28:35,980 --> 00:28:39,980
I did not know that hit him up and say what's up, what's up? He just says dot

452
00:28:39,980 --> 00:28:40,940
dot dot every time

453
00:28:40,940 --> 00:28:42,900
can't speak or type.

454
00:28:42,900 --> 00:28:46,780
I would love to have a conversation with him where he does the typing thing like

455
00:28:46,780 --> 00:28:50,860
a top gun Maverick. Yeah, like hey man, what's up and he's like and also he's

456
00:28:50,860 --> 00:28:55,340
not much. He's so fucking old that it's you know it's just not in Peck all the

457
00:28:55,340 --> 00:28:59,220
time. He did not learn. Well, he was in that movie in the 80s where he plays a

458
00:28:59,220 --> 00:29:03,420
scientist. I can't believe he did that with his religion being that I know

459
00:29:03,580 --> 00:29:04,580
That's really surprising.

460
00:29:04,580 --> 00:29:11,400
He, um, in 2013 he was doing this like one man play where he plays Mark Twain and he wore

461
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:12,580
this like crazy prosthetic.

462
00:29:12,580 --> 00:29:13,820
I saw that picture.

463
00:29:13,820 --> 00:29:15,820
Yeah, he came to my hometown.

464
00:29:15,820 --> 00:29:16,820
Really?

465
00:29:16,820 --> 00:29:18,260
And he did the Mark Twain show.

466
00:29:18,260 --> 00:29:20,780
Val Kilmer came to the one man show in, uh.

467
00:29:20,780 --> 00:29:22,860
Well he did one town over, it was in Derry.

468
00:29:22,860 --> 00:29:23,860
In Derry, New Hampshire?

469
00:29:23,860 --> 00:29:27,180
I almost went and saw it because I was just like, why the fuck is he doing that?

470
00:29:27,180 --> 00:29:28,180
I bet it was awesome.

471
00:29:28,180 --> 00:29:29,180
I bet it was sick.

472
00:29:29,180 --> 00:29:30,180
I bet it was a once in a lifetime experience.

473
00:29:30,180 --> 00:29:32,540
And he just missed out on it because now he can't do it anymore.

474
00:29:32,540 --> 00:29:33,540
No, now he can't.

475
00:29:33,540 --> 00:29:37,580
he didn't he's going to do it again. Wait, but he wrote he wrote. Oh my goodness.

476
00:29:37,580 --> 00:29:41,700
Why was he dressing up like Mark Twain for the play? Yeah,

477
00:29:41,700 --> 00:29:48,020
what kind of question is why? What is his leg? I don't understand. Why was he

478
00:29:48,020 --> 00:29:52,540
doing that? Like no, that's not a very marginal thing creative. Yeah, I guess I

479
00:29:52,540 --> 00:29:58,300
guess it's all your hearters exercise. I would listen if I was if I if I got had

480
00:29:58,300 --> 00:30:03,180
brain damage, yeah, from you know, taking one antibiotic once deciding that I'm

481
00:30:03,220 --> 00:30:07,620
never going to take it again and it you know viruses and bacteria ravage my

482
00:30:07,620 --> 00:30:11,200
system because they don't take the full course. It infects my brain, half of my

483
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:14,880
brain decays. There you go. I would also completely be doing tours around the

484
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:18,780
country where I'm doing plays about American authors yeah and I would also

485
00:30:18,780 --> 00:30:22,960
be going on stage at American authors concert. I'd be doing one singing a lot.

486
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:31,980
I'd be I would be doing a musical called American authors. That is about mark

487
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:37,080
Mark Twain and the band of Melville and all the other one all the music is

488
00:30:37,080 --> 00:30:41,720
American authors music. That's a good idea. That's another good idea. It's a

489
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:46,720
five act play. It's five authors and five new original. This is it's cloud

490
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:47,160
atlas.

491
00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:54,120
Oh, my God, all authors are related. Who are the authors Herman Melville and

492
00:30:54,120 --> 00:30:56,760
Mark Twain, Dave peakly pickly

493
00:30:56,760 --> 00:30:58,800
play

494
00:30:58,800 --> 00:30:59,800
so

495
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:06,940
Dave, and then we have to have one a we have to have one that is a comic book

496
00:31:06,940 --> 00:31:10,840
writer to like that's like the last one where it's like a or a blogger where

497
00:31:10,840 --> 00:31:12,600
it's developed. I guess that's mad wall.

498
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:14,840
Yeah, yeah,

499
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:18,760
Stanley Stanley and then

500
00:31:18,760 --> 00:31:23,200
Stanley is like in the middle. It goes like a Herman Melville Stanley and then

501
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:23,560
mark

502
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:30,940
that's a wonderful idea yeah. It's a good ideas day. I think that I would do a

503
00:31:30,940 --> 00:31:35,320
one man show about the real life of the actual Peter Parker, the historical

504
00:31:35,320 --> 00:31:40,280
Peter. Yeah, that's a really good idea, the true story, not the fictional

505
00:31:40,280 --> 00:31:43,720
isation. You actually, I think, could make so much money doing that. If do

506
00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:47,640
you know how the way you do it is what is you do it as a Stan Lee biopic and

507
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:52,880
you like do it as like a Meta fiction thing and he's meeting all the real

508
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:56,400
people. I think you could actually make a hundred million dollars

509
00:31:56,400 --> 00:32:02,520
like all the inspiration. Oh my God, Peter Parker, it's so the idea that he

510
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:07,040
like meets just like a homeless guy. That's like what's up, bub? I've been

511
00:32:07,040 --> 00:32:07,360
alive.

512
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:12,120
The way you do it, you literally do it so that you don't buy the licenses to

513
00:32:12,120 --> 00:32:15,480
any of the marvel characters at all and you just have stuff that like suggests

514
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:18,320
it and you have moments where he looks at something and you can tell what he's

515
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:20,520
he meets a water found. He's like

516
00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:26,360
and then about fifty percent of the movie is him whipping Jack Kirby with a

517
00:32:26,360 --> 00:32:27,120
belt. Yeah,

518
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:33,320
drar it, drar it, you fucker yeah, Jack Kirby is the guy who is accused of

519
00:32:33,320 --> 00:32:38,900
killing JFK yeah, Jack Ruby, the guy who killed Lee Harvey Oswald. So Jack Kirby

520
00:32:38,900 --> 00:32:44,480
is a second guy involved. He drew he drew all the X man, created basically

521
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:47,820
all the marvel stuff and Stanley took credit for all of it. He was the he was

522
00:32:47,860 --> 00:32:50,980
the artist he's you know the guy better made you did the guy who made a

523
00:32:50,980 --> 00:32:55,300
Stanley's real Stanley's real name is Stanley Lieberman and he took the name

524
00:32:55,300 --> 00:33:00,780
Stanley. He went by first name only a let yeah, but the the same situate

525
00:33:00,780 --> 00:33:01,940
situation happens

526
00:33:01,940 --> 00:33:05,360
to watch the same situation,

527
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:11,260
same situation happened to one Bob finger yep, Bill Kane and Bob Bill Kane

528
00:33:11,260 --> 00:33:12,660
and Bob I'd fucking

529
00:33:12,660 --> 00:33:14,900
yeah,

530
00:33:17,620 --> 00:33:23,420
finger, bill finger, you are, I would walk all over you on the cover. No, no,

531
00:33:23,420 --> 00:33:29,460
no, who's bill finger? He's the guy who stole Batman yeah from bill finger bill

532
00:33:29,460 --> 00:33:33,720
finger, a bat man and then bill dude, you're his name's bill finger.

533
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:35,180
Everyone's just going to bully him.

534
00:33:35,180 --> 00:33:41,460
I'm still a guy named bill finger. I'm bill finger. It's so funny to steal

535
00:33:41,460 --> 00:33:46,180
credit from bill finger. I mean listen, even if they believe you, they're not

536
00:33:46,220 --> 00:33:49,860
kind of want to put your name back on. We would not have that man. There would

537
00:33:49,860 --> 00:33:55,120
be no dc no dc anything yeah. If bob cain big daddy cain didn't step up yeah

538
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:56,460
daddy

539
00:33:56,460 --> 00:34:01,360
things through a little pinky finger. Yeah, exactly there you go. You got all

540
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:06,060
the that you got. Oh, okay pointer yeah, stop calling me point dexter okay,

541
00:34:06,060 --> 00:34:10,260
all right, middle middle. No one thinks about you because you're so middle.

542
00:34:10,260 --> 00:34:14,660
You're middle ring a ding ding ring a ding ding okay, thumb pinky thumb okay,

543
00:34:14,700 --> 00:34:18,340
I'm Thumpsy. Thumpsy would be good. Thumpsy Whumpsy. And then you have to go

544
00:34:18,340 --> 00:34:21,740
to it. Then you'd have to say left hand finger. Who made Vertigo? Who's the

545
00:34:21,740 --> 00:34:25,500
genius who invented Vertigo, the dark comics for adults? Wasn't that part of

546
00:34:25,500 --> 00:34:26,700
DC and they broke off? Yeah.

547
00:34:26,700 --> 00:34:31,740
That was like... Wasn't that fucking like Rob... Wasn't Rob Leefield involved

548
00:34:31,740 --> 00:34:35,340
or something? Or is Rob Leefield Vertigo or Image? Might have been Image.

549
00:34:35,340 --> 00:34:40,220
And then I bet that... And then also is which one is fucking

550
00:34:41,860 --> 00:34:46,900
Todd McFarland. Oh, that's a God. What is that? I know. Is that Vertigo?

551
00:34:46,900 --> 00:34:50,700
It might be Vertigo. He has his own. No, he has like his own thing.

552
00:34:50,700 --> 00:34:54,340
Oh, yeah. He has his own thing now, but he might have been the... That might...

553
00:34:54,340 --> 00:34:56,580
I forget. That might have been one of the first Vertigos. One of the first,

554
00:34:56,580 --> 00:34:59,140
yeah, one of the things... I remember seeing a... Going to some comic book

555
00:34:59,140 --> 00:35:02,460
store, and I never really liked comics, but I bought a bunch of Vertigo comics

556
00:35:02,460 --> 00:35:06,780
and... They was all like... 'Cause they just looked so awesome and sexual and

557
00:35:06,780 --> 00:35:09,460
violent. They was all try hard shit, though. Yeah, it was awesome. I was so

558
00:35:09,460 --> 00:35:12,180
fire. It would always be like a bunny that smoke cigarettes,

559
00:35:12,180 --> 00:35:17,900
yeah, and everybody everybody else is human and the bunny has a has a human

560
00:35:17,900 --> 00:35:21,180
girlfriend who's like really, really hot and they do like a I felt the same way

561
00:35:21,180 --> 00:35:25,660
reading those comics at the at the comic book shop that I do did looking at porn.

562
00:35:25,660 --> 00:35:29,300
Yeah, I'm in trouble when you're like someone well, it's like hole in your

563
00:35:29,300 --> 00:35:34,500
stomach on your neck. Yeah, I hope this guy's made of blood. Oh my God, a guy

564
00:35:34,540 --> 00:35:39,180
made of blood and his best friend is made of knives. Oh fuck that's so dark

565
00:35:39,180 --> 00:35:44,420
that's the darkest thing. I can imagine grittiness, all the grittiness. Oh my

566
00:35:44,420 --> 00:35:48,220
God, this guy has yeah reading, I yeah go buying it would be like you go and

567
00:35:48,220 --> 00:35:52,060
you buy the comic about the guy made of blood and his name is is gut gut yeah

568
00:35:52,060 --> 00:35:56,100
gut and he has an he has an imaginary friend. That's a unicorn that swears and

569
00:35:56,100 --> 00:35:59,820
they use they do stars and bombs and yes, and you'll be buying those and you'll

570
00:35:59,820 --> 00:36:03,220
be like yeah. I just like comics that are kind of like dark and realistic yeah

571
00:36:03,420 --> 00:36:05,380
really like gritty realism

572
00:36:05,380 --> 00:36:11,060
four arms and he has a K forty seven and eat like have you played that game, the

573
00:36:11,060 --> 00:36:14,140
wolf among us, the telltale game, I think it's based on a comic or some

574
00:36:14,140 --> 00:36:19,220
shit. I think it's a it's about the if fairy tales were real and they were,

575
00:36:19,220 --> 00:36:22,300
but it was a way of a yeah. I have seen this yeah.

576
00:36:22,300 --> 00:36:27,780
Oh actually yeah, that is where like what's his name? Ichabod crane is like

577
00:36:27,820 --> 00:36:35,060
bad like evil rich guy. You can tell how every everybody who writes comic books

578
00:36:35,060 --> 00:36:38,220
has their have their brains completely broken. They were all they all live the

579
00:36:38,220 --> 00:36:41,660
worst childhoods of all time, because every single one of them when they set

580
00:36:41,660 --> 00:36:45,660
out they're like all right. I want to write a comic book that's it's going to

581
00:36:45,660 --> 00:36:48,980
be gritty and realistic, so we're going to cover like real world stuff. We're

582
00:36:48,980 --> 00:36:51,700
going to take a look at issues. It's like okay, well, first of all, Batman

583
00:36:51,700 --> 00:36:53,420
gets raped one thousand times yeah. I know

584
00:36:55,580 --> 00:37:00,500
that's like the killing joke. It's literally all that. It's so crazy.

585
00:37:00,500 --> 00:37:04,120
That's like all, that's what happens to Batgirl in the killing joke. Dude,

586
00:37:04,120 --> 00:37:07,640
the wife finally made me throw away the killing joke copy I had since I was

587
00:37:07,640 --> 00:37:10,720
twelve. No. Well, they made me throw it away, but she asked if I wanted it,

588
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:14,440
and I said, I don't think so. I still have mine. I don't think I need that

589
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:18,880
for anything. Yeah. Yeah. I think that they need to reboot a gritty version

590
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:21,920
of the Stinky Cheese Man now. That'd be a good, well, the Stinky Cheese Man

591
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:26,080
supposed to be a great version of those like fairy. Yeah, but we need to go

592
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:31,080
gritty. That's I think that is so prime for like one of those public domain

593
00:37:31,080 --> 00:37:33,880
horror movie. The Stinky Cheese movie. Absolutely.

594
00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:38,720
Horror movie. That shit sucks so bad. Yeah, it's terrible. Oh, oh, what did

595
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:44,320
they do recently? The banana splits. Yeah. I heard that one was kind of fun,

596
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:45,760
but it's the same idea. Yeah.

597
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:49,880
That's always the most... What are they gonna do when we go into public domain?

598
00:37:49,960 --> 00:37:53,540
it's going to happen. When we start the podcast twenty nineteen, I think

599
00:37:53,540 --> 00:37:56,980
honestly, I think right now we are in public domain. I don't think we have

600
00:37:56,980 --> 00:37:57,660
any really

601
00:37:57,660 --> 00:38:02,960
never thought in anything, but don't we have is in which we might have creative

602
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:07,620
commons yeah. So that's got to run out soon. Probably that's a five year thing,

603
00:38:07,620 --> 00:38:11,360
so we're probably coming up on us. Be creative commons can't work. That can't

604
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:15,700
be real. It can't be like okay. If I put this, if I put a JPEG in the

605
00:38:15,740 --> 00:38:20,460
description of my deviant art post, it's copyrighted yeah. I can't hold up man.

606
00:38:20,460 --> 00:38:24,140
There's no way that's not holding up. I don't believe you can copy and paste

607
00:38:24,140 --> 00:38:27,180
everything. It says this is covered by creative commons. Yeah, it's like oh

608
00:38:27,180 --> 00:38:29,780
okay. Well, I guess I won't steal it. Sorry. I was thinking of stealing it.

609
00:38:29,780 --> 00:38:34,180
Yeah, I thought that creative commons meant that it was public domain. I

610
00:38:34,180 --> 00:38:36,540
thought that that was another word levels of creative common. There's

611
00:38:36,540 --> 00:38:39,860
different licenses, but that's the funniest creative commons license is

612
00:38:39,860 --> 00:38:43,140
creative common zero, where the license is you can do whatever you want with

613
00:38:43,180 --> 00:38:43,680
Yes,

614
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:44,680
okay, cool.

615
00:38:44,680 --> 00:38:49,480
Thanks for taking the time to put that into your thing to say that I think we

616
00:38:49,480 --> 00:38:50,400
may have that one.

617
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:57,180
I had something that flew away from my brain to talk about what a fly. It was

618
00:38:57,180 --> 00:38:57,920
a fly that was

619
00:38:57,920 --> 00:39:02,340
opened up my brain to look at my thoughts and like an empty wallet, a fly

620
00:39:02,340 --> 00:39:05,700
buzzed around it out. You're talking about a movie idea that's dark and

621
00:39:05,700 --> 00:39:09,780
gritty. Oh no, are they doing one with with Mickey Mouse? Yeah, he's the

622
00:39:09,780 --> 00:39:10,100
steam.

623
00:39:10,940 --> 00:39:14,440
Yeah, they've already done a trillion of them. I think I think literally the day

624
00:39:14,440 --> 00:39:19,640
that it went into public domain, there was a thousand. So where's our idea? I

625
00:39:19,640 --> 00:39:23,200
want to get some money really see boat Willie. I think you got to go. I think

626
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:24,280
I ship has sailed

627
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:27,280
the steam.

628
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:34,280
I forgot about that. I think that the way to go is, you know, everybody's

629
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:37,120
doing well. First of all, everyone's doing horror. Yeah, because obviously

630
00:39:37,120 --> 00:39:40,600
he's a cartoon. So we should also doing violent funniest of her shooters.

631
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:44,560
romantic. Oh, that's an even better. Nobody is going to do that. Well,

632
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:48,520
there's romance. A woman falls in love with steamboat willy isn't that isn't

633
00:39:48,520 --> 00:39:53,240
that a human woman? Oh okay, in real action, live action, I was going to say

634
00:39:53,240 --> 00:39:56,320
doesn't, but we're going to call it real action. Taylor Swift, Taylor,

635
00:39:56,320 --> 00:40:00,640
Taylor's, not public. She's not she's public. She is not public. She belongs

636
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:05,640
to she belongs to trap. No, she doesn't the trap, the T for the entire public.

637
00:40:05,640 --> 00:40:09,640
No bro. She is loyal. She is not for the public super. Take it back. Actually,

638
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:14,280
I'll take it back. I'm not dude. What if she does the half time show as a

639
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:14,880
surprise?

640
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:19,600
I'm doing the half that would never happen. I sure I think it's usher. Oh,

641
00:40:19,600 --> 00:40:22,480
isn't that funny? Well, but then that would be funny. She can't do that

642
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:26,040
because what if she does the halftime show and the Chiefs are down thirty six

643
00:40:26,040 --> 00:40:30,120
to three, it will power motivation. Yeah, I don't think so. I think there's

644
00:40:30,120 --> 00:40:35,800
another team this year. The forty niners is it yeah, I'm looking to you. I don't

645
00:40:35,820 --> 00:40:39,860
no, actually I'm not like if I know that before Caleb man card

646
00:40:39,860 --> 00:40:46,060
don't take my man, bro. You're going to be oh snap way. You're actually in

647
00:40:46,060 --> 00:40:50,940
francisco bro. I'm I pains me to do this. I'm rooting for Kansas. This is

648
00:40:50,940 --> 00:40:55,260
tough for me because I like Taylor swift and I like san francisco because I'm

649
00:40:55,260 --> 00:40:58,980
gay. I like both. Let's let's let's let's I don't know which one the like

650
00:40:58,980 --> 00:41:01,620
on here. Okay, san francisco gay,

651
00:41:02,380 --> 00:41:08,860
Kansas City, probably straight yeah. She is the straight versus gay. Yes, but

652
00:41:08,860 --> 00:41:09,100
not

653
00:41:09,100 --> 00:41:17,640
she's racist name true forty niners cool name. Yes, very cool. Also Kansas kind of

654
00:41:17,640 --> 00:41:21,580
white because they have a big state in what way owner because forty niners were

655
00:41:21,580 --> 00:41:24,980
real white people. Yeah, I guess you're right. So you never thought about that

656
00:41:24,980 --> 00:41:26,460
yeah minor forty nine. So

657
00:41:26,460 --> 00:41:30,300
Kansas City's gay. They have a big statue of a boner in the middle of the

658
00:41:30,340 --> 00:41:33,540
city, the big arch. I don't know anything about Kansas. That's not about a boner.

659
00:41:33,540 --> 00:41:39,100
That's a boner. So but okay, so a Volvo Kansas City has has has has Travis and

660
00:41:39,100 --> 00:41:43,900
Taylor. Yeah. Who does San Francisco have? Oh, they have boner. They have

661
00:41:43,900 --> 00:41:47,060
Travis and Taylor. But it's a guy's guy.

662
00:41:47,060 --> 00:41:49,260
Got him and Steve.

663
00:41:49,260 --> 00:41:54,180
I don't know. Okay. I don't really know who's involved in. So I think it's

664
00:41:54,180 --> 00:41:58,060
stacking up on the side of of Kansas. Okay, well, let's do a full analysis of

665
00:41:58,060 --> 00:42:01,160
for this yeah San Francisco. What is what do they have in their corner right now?

666
00:42:01,160 --> 00:42:05,520
The apple vision home has just been really and plus a homeless Ryan. There

667
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:07,760
will be homeless people sitting in their mansions watching this

668
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:14,800
who are going to absolutely riot if the nine or forty nine imagine if Taylor

669
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:16,380
Swift was from San Francisco.

670
00:42:16,380 --> 00:42:23,020
Where's she from she's from she's supposed to be southern she's supposed

671
00:42:23,020 --> 00:42:26,800
to be. It is like trying to to understand a fictional care. You use to

672
00:42:26,840 --> 00:42:32,240
story southern, but now she's from the internet Pennsylvania. That can't be

673
00:42:32,240 --> 00:42:36,540
what that's crazy. That's fucking that's so crazy as

674
00:42:36,540 --> 00:42:42,160
she's never claimed Pennsylvania at least once. Where does she live? I thought

675
00:42:42,160 --> 00:42:45,920
she was a she like was she born there and then she like immediately how close

676
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:47,320
is reading to like Philly

677
00:42:47,320 --> 00:42:53,640
whyo missing what the fuck is whyo missing? What is whyo fuck you whyo

678
00:42:53,680 --> 00:42:56,280
if you live in a town called why I'm missing, you are not going to make it

679
00:42:56,280 --> 00:43:00,320
why you're missing. Okay, I'm right now. Okay, wait, well, Philly,

680
00:43:00,320 --> 00:43:05,440
Philadelphia is kind of southern, though yeah, it's not enough. It's not enough

681
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:09,760
for what she's rocking. That's yeah, it's not that it's not horse flannel

682
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:14,540
t. No, no, yeah, but it's kind of it can be country, but it's she wears

683
00:43:14,540 --> 00:43:18,000
short skirts. I wear t shirts. It's a concern. What happened in Pennsylvania?

684
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:21,700
Yeah, that happens a lot of Pennsylvania. I've heard I didn't realize

685
00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:23,760
she was a I guess they have a

686
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:27,660
tenancy or some doors in pencil. Yeah, I thought she was well. I guess I had I

687
00:43:27,660 --> 00:43:31,180
haven't she hasn't been pretending to be southern for quite a while now. Yeah,

688
00:43:31,180 --> 00:43:34,960
yeah, I think she got over that. I think even if she was southern, I would still

689
00:43:34,960 --> 00:43:37,500
consider it pretending to be southern. She's pretending to be christian.

690
00:43:37,500 --> 00:43:43,800
She may not be pretending. She's having sex on the night. I let now don't I

691
00:43:43,800 --> 00:43:47,600
don't want to listen everybody listening this right now. I you can't spread this

692
00:43:47,600 --> 00:43:51,740
okay. What this is exclusive. I haven't told this to anybody else. It this is it

693
00:43:51,740 --> 00:43:56,540
think you could consider it Super Bowl gossip. I Taylor gossip exclusive. I was

694
00:43:56,540 --> 00:44:04,260
at church now this past weekend and I was bowing my head in prayer and I hear a

695
00:44:04,260 --> 00:44:05,380
noise next to me.

696
00:44:05,380 --> 00:44:10,740
Someone's phone buzz. I look over to scream at them and say, turn your phone

697
00:44:10,740 --> 00:44:16,700
off off all the way, leave it at the door. Who is it Taylor Swift and Travis

698
00:44:16,700 --> 00:44:20,780
Kelsey holding hands and this was in New York and what kind of this was in New

699
00:44:20,820 --> 00:44:25,260
York. This was a Latino church really. So they go to a that I go to church.

700
00:44:25,260 --> 00:44:27,100
What's the name of it? Iglesia

701
00:44:27,100 --> 00:44:33,820
Iglesia, okay, Iglesia Jesucristo. Okay, wow, I believe this now. So they go

702
00:44:33,820 --> 00:44:39,140
to a fully Spanish speaking church and they and I saw they had Google translate

703
00:44:39,140 --> 00:44:43,780
open on their phone. They share a phone. That's adorable. They share a

704
00:44:43,780 --> 00:44:46,460
it's a Samsung Galaxy. It's one of the they have a Facebook, they have a

705
00:44:46,500 --> 00:44:51,460
Facebook account that is called Travis and Tei. Wow! Travis Tei, I sent a

706
00:44:51,460 --> 00:44:55,940
request, not accepted yet, but okay, I think I might Travis Taylor and that's

707
00:44:55,940 --> 00:44:58,860
really hard to find because there's so many Travis Taylor's in the world, but

708
00:44:58,860 --> 00:45:02,620
they were on their phone, they were running Google Translate and they were

709
00:45:02,620 --> 00:45:03,180
reading the

710
00:45:03,180 --> 00:45:09,300
translation, which is even harder because it's like it's a lot of the songs are in

711
00:45:09,300 --> 00:45:14,220
Latin and she and he was dressed up nice to the nines. She was wearing a T shirt

712
00:45:14,260 --> 00:45:17,960
my sweat pants like she just rolled out of bed. Wow, so what you're telling me is

713
00:45:17,960 --> 00:45:21,600
these celebs that I idolize are actually just real people walking. Yeah, except

714
00:45:21,600 --> 00:45:25,500
for Travis Kelsey, who dresses up yeah. Did he dress up like a when you say

715
00:45:25,500 --> 00:45:29,140
dress in the night, the forty nines, he's a football player. He was no, he was in a

716
00:45:29,140 --> 00:45:34,580
he was in a full tux and a top hat to church church on Sunday. Wow, top hat,

717
00:45:34,580 --> 00:45:38,640
the top hat, well, the whole the whole thing was lilac and did he have

718
00:45:38,640 --> 00:45:41,820
coattails? Lilacs a really beautiful color. I couldn't tell if he had

719
00:45:41,840 --> 00:45:44,720
coat tails, because he did not move his butt enough for me to see against the

720
00:45:44,720 --> 00:45:46,860
pew and I believe me. I was trying to check

721
00:45:46,860 --> 00:45:49,260
trying to get him to lean forward a little bit. I said

722
00:45:49,260 --> 00:45:54,480
I said, Oop, you dropped your pencil and he said what pencil and you when you

723
00:45:54,480 --> 00:45:54,760
take

724
00:45:54,760 --> 00:45:59,060
when you take notes on in church, no, but it's easy to see some of these

725
00:45:59,060 --> 00:46:03,400
coat tails when they're sitting down and I also heard that he was praying. He

726
00:46:03,400 --> 00:46:07,280
uttered a secret prayer. He thought he was doing it quite enough that no one

727
00:46:07,280 --> 00:46:11,680
could hear, but his phone picked it up when they were using the translation. I

728
00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:15,700
put it off the Spanish. He said, Dear God, please slaughter and eliminate the

729
00:46:15,700 --> 00:46:21,040
family members of every man, woman and child in San Francisco. Wow, so that

730
00:46:21,040 --> 00:46:26,520
doesn't strike me as so loving into God. No, no, so he wants God to do nefarious

731
00:46:26,520 --> 00:46:30,640
things for him. He wants God to do his bidding. He thinks he can move heaven

732
00:46:30,640 --> 00:46:34,160
and earth just because he's famous. So this is a battle.

733
00:46:34,160 --> 00:46:39,000
This is Sodom and Gomorrah versus Bethlehem. This is angel versus

734
00:46:39,040 --> 00:46:44,040
Pennsylvania. Pretty close to wow. We're Taylor Swift is so again that's a

735
00:46:44,040 --> 00:46:45,520
Sodom and Gomorrah Kansas.

736
00:46:45,520 --> 00:46:48,940
I like

737
00:46:48,940 --> 00:46:53,560
Sodom and Gomorrah sounds amazing and it's a Twin Cities. It sounds amazing.

738
00:46:53,560 --> 00:46:57,480
I'm gonna go more like imagine you go to Sodom and you're like, oh, well, I

739
00:46:57,480 --> 00:47:00,560
really I'm loving the vibe. The more is like and they're like just go, oh, just

740
00:47:00,560 --> 00:47:03,640
go to Gomorrah. It's right over the bridge, go over there, whole new type of

741
00:47:03,640 --> 00:47:07,280
vibe, different music, different coffee. When you live it, when you live in

742
00:47:07,320 --> 00:47:10,560
Samora and your friend text you and goes yo I'm going to be in your area next

743
00:47:10,560 --> 00:47:13,480
week. Let's hang out. We cut rolls around. Hey man, where you stand? Oh,

744
00:47:13,480 --> 00:47:14,560
I'm just in Sodom. Oh

745
00:47:14,560 --> 00:47:22,300
I that kills me man, bro. It's literally an hour away to my train. It's two

746
00:47:22,300 --> 00:47:26,400
hours. Yeah, it takes forever. It's on horse. I mean I have to get it and if

747
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:29,800
you look back, you turn into a pillar. Yes, I can't even I don't even know how

748
00:47:29,800 --> 00:47:31,120
far I am from home.

749
00:47:31,120 --> 00:47:33,280
It's bullshit man.

750
00:47:34,560 --> 00:47:39,600
yeah, we need a I mean San Francisco. Why is there not a high speed line

751
00:47:39,600 --> 00:47:40,340
between Sodom and

752
00:47:40,340 --> 00:47:41,880
perfect

753
00:47:41,880 --> 00:47:48,040
my dream transit map Sodom to Gomorrah one line, the brown line

754
00:47:48,040 --> 00:47:49,840
right there.

755
00:47:49,840 --> 00:47:51,820
Yeah, I

756
00:47:51,820 --> 00:47:57,880
guess it is a bit of it fails a little bit because San Francisco wait, Oakland

757
00:47:57,880 --> 00:48:00,160
yeah, Oakland is Gomorrah

758
00:48:02,040 --> 00:48:05,400
Because Sodom was kind of the main one.

759
00:48:05,400 --> 00:48:06,240
- Yeah.

760
00:48:06,240 --> 00:48:08,280
- The cool one where all the artists live.

761
00:48:08,280 --> 00:48:10,400
- No, Oakland's the one where all the artists live.

762
00:48:10,400 --> 00:48:13,120
- Okay, well Gamora, the artists wanted,

763
00:48:13,120 --> 00:48:14,560
they used to live in Sodom.

764
00:48:14,560 --> 00:48:15,440
- Then it got too hipster-y.

765
00:48:15,440 --> 00:48:16,680
- And then it got too hipster-y,

766
00:48:16,680 --> 00:48:18,920
and yuppies moved in with their tech jobs

767
00:48:18,920 --> 00:48:22,400
doing abacus work, and they kicked out

768
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:25,320
all the hipsters and artists who then had to live in Gamora.

769
00:48:25,320 --> 00:48:29,680
And now it's a commuter city, and that's bullshit.

770
00:48:29,680 --> 00:48:31,740
- Yeah, it's true.

771
00:48:31,740 --> 00:48:34,820
It would be funny to be living back in biblical times and you're pushed out

772
00:48:34,820 --> 00:48:38,620
there. All the tech bros start coming to your city and they're inventing carts.

773
00:48:38,620 --> 00:48:42,300
Yeah, new car push carts. They're inventing slaves. The idea of having a

774
00:48:42,300 --> 00:48:48,460
slave. This is an iron. Imagine a guy who can do it for you. Okay, Steve,

775
00:48:48,460 --> 00:48:53,540
Steve Jobs presentation of a guy just like this showing he starts with. He has

776
00:48:53,540 --> 00:48:58,100
the same progression as the iphone reveal where it's like a dog, a horse and

777
00:48:58,140 --> 00:49:02,580
than like an outline of a guy and then they show that it's a human. Oh yeah,

778
00:49:02,580 --> 00:49:07,280
they're doing he's doing the yearly keynote, the Steve jobs way back from way

779
00:49:07,280 --> 00:49:11,280
back when and he's like well up to now we've been able we've been able to paint

780
00:49:11,280 --> 00:49:16,080
things red. We've been able to paint things yellow yep and but now, thanks to

781
00:49:16,080 --> 00:49:20,240
these flowers, I found guys we can paint things blue and one more thing

782
00:49:20,240 --> 00:49:24,240
and one more thing. Blue is a color now.

783
00:49:24,240 --> 00:49:26,940
Oh my God,

784
00:49:27,940 --> 00:49:31,400
everybody yeah. You see everyone waiting in line to get their first blue rocks,

785
00:49:31,400 --> 00:49:31,760
yeah

786
00:49:31,760 --> 00:49:37,020
bunch of pictures in the tablet. The next day it's crazy that this this this

787
00:49:37,020 --> 00:49:41,720
ancient this biblical time, Steve jobs and Steve jobs probably both died trying

788
00:49:41,720 --> 00:49:43,020
to cure their shit with juice.

789
00:49:43,020 --> 00:49:50,460
True, a very similar life from a medical stand. I just need to drink a bunch more

790
00:49:50,600 --> 00:49:53,160
confused by cancers, Steve Toiles,

791
00:49:53,160 --> 00:49:57,740
Steve

792
00:49:57,740 --> 00:50:04,500
yeah, but he didn't do the Flintstones invention. He did actual stuff that

793
00:50:04,500 --> 00:50:10,260
they used, but yeah, he had real concrete stuff exact like concrete,

794
00:50:10,260 --> 00:50:13,820
yeah.

795
00:50:13,820 --> 00:50:19,280
I think I wish I think if I could go back in time anywhere, it would be Bible

796
00:50:19,320 --> 00:50:22,320
times just to see if it all really happened to them. Yeah. Yeah, I would

797
00:50:22,320 --> 00:50:25,560
watch this is kind of a completely different branch off of what we were just

798
00:50:25,560 --> 00:50:28,880
talking about, but I would watch a keynote of if they did

799
00:50:28,880 --> 00:50:33,880
if they did a keynote for every single industry. One like can you imagine how

800
00:50:33,880 --> 00:50:37,280
incredible it would be to watch a keynote for like construction workers? Don't

801
00:50:37,280 --> 00:50:40,840
think we have a new tool. Yeah, they do that, but I don't I would like it. I

802
00:50:40,840 --> 00:50:44,080
want it on the same scale. Yeah, I don't record the same production value. Yeah,

803
00:50:44,080 --> 00:50:47,040
I mean I would watch the last conferences. This is the kind of thing I

804
00:50:47,080 --> 00:50:49,480
Yeah, elevator repairman go to like...

805
00:50:49,480 --> 00:50:51,140
Yeah, I know, but I'm saying I want the keynote.

806
00:50:51,140 --> 00:50:52,380
I want them to do it up.

807
00:50:52,380 --> 00:50:53,380
You want some...

808
00:50:53,380 --> 00:50:59,300
Well, that would mean that there needs to be an Apple-type head of their industry for

809
00:50:59,300 --> 00:51:01,260
that type of stuff, for manual labor.

810
00:51:01,260 --> 00:51:04,660
Or they could all work together to make a good presentation.

811
00:51:04,660 --> 00:51:05,660
That's not very...

812
00:51:05,660 --> 00:51:06,660
It's like a music festival.

813
00:51:06,660 --> 00:51:07,660
Isn't that what they...

814
00:51:07,660 --> 00:51:11,480
That's what they do in Paul Bart Mall Cop 2.

815
00:51:11,480 --> 00:51:15,880
I have a convenient Apple keynote thing, but for security guards at the mall.

816
00:51:15,880 --> 00:51:21,880
Wait, this already exists. Yeah, that's got to be real too, though. They've got

817
00:51:21,880 --> 00:51:25,580
to have some. I'm sure they do. There's conferences for every job. Why do we not

818
00:51:25,580 --> 00:51:29,880
have a I mean, we'll do it. The podcasters keynote will do it. The

819
00:51:29,880 --> 00:51:34,180
podcaster summit. Yeah, if I definitely do, but it's for the people who do like

820
00:51:34,180 --> 00:51:38,080
and this year we present. Yeah, and this and one more thing. That's right. We

821
00:51:38,080 --> 00:51:41,760
we have cameras. We don't know how to use that kind of thing every single year.

822
00:51:41,760 --> 00:51:45,440
Yeah, it's a good idea. We bought more equipment that we have no idea what the

823
00:51:45,440 --> 00:51:46,240
fuck to do with,

824
00:51:46,240 --> 00:51:50,400
but it feels like we're supposed to have it. It is like it is fucked up that

825
00:51:50,400 --> 00:51:51,640
they're like

826
00:51:51,640 --> 00:51:55,280
like I think I'm think about how much work we put into that. We don't know how

827
00:51:55,280 --> 00:51:58,360
to use the cameras. We barely know how to do this. Sometimes there's like people

828
00:51:58,360 --> 00:52:01,480
who like have you maybe you barely know. I barely know how to do it. You we have

829
00:52:01,480 --> 00:52:06,440
a guy that knows how to do one part of every hole of this thing. I guess that's

830
00:52:06,720 --> 00:52:10,920
kind of true and there's podcast out there. When you say to somebody like,

831
00:52:10,920 --> 00:52:16,080
oh yeah, like my job is a podcast, there's podcasts that have like they're

832
00:52:16,080 --> 00:52:19,360
edited and they have music to them. Should we just start? I would. How the

833
00:52:19,360 --> 00:52:23,360
hell is that? I would really like to think that part of the reason people

834
00:52:23,360 --> 00:52:26,160
like us is because we don't know what we're doing and maybe that's part of the

835
00:52:26,160 --> 00:52:31,520
charm of it because otherwise it hurts, it hurts my soul. Yeah. Do you think

836
00:52:31,520 --> 00:52:34,960
that we could start telling people we're a part of your mom's house studios and

837
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:38,140
you might believe us easily. Well, they might not know what that is. So yeah,

838
00:52:38,140 --> 00:52:43,220
well, if they know what it is, I think they could we do inspect element and

839
00:52:43,220 --> 00:52:48,700
change their website on one end and you can see great just start posting all

840
00:52:48,700 --> 00:52:51,640
the time. You can bring your cousin. No, I want to prank millions of people.

841
00:52:51,640 --> 00:52:55,360
Yeah, because nobody's gonna check. Nobody inspect element. Yes, I can.

842
00:52:55,360 --> 00:52:58,800
All right, I just did it to prove and it's back to your element.

843
00:52:58,800 --> 00:53:00,560
Mustache

844
00:53:01,500 --> 00:53:05,200
brackets must dash you're doing really good brackets. Yeah, can you believe

845
00:53:05,200 --> 00:53:08,400
that people another must? Can you guys believe that you have your pubes shaved

846
00:53:08,400 --> 00:53:12,620
into a mustache? That's odd. That's a cool idea. That is cool. It's actually

847
00:53:12,620 --> 00:53:15,000
cool eyebrows, a goatee,

848
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:22,080
a goatee above. I wish I had just like a circle. I wish that my pubes were more

849
00:53:22,080 --> 00:53:27,940
easily shaved like that. Yeah, maybe I'll shave him into an X. No out get out

850
00:53:27,940 --> 00:53:29,360
of here. Just the word out

851
00:53:31,420 --> 00:53:34,420
Fuck off. If you're reading this, the bitch fell off.

852
00:53:34,420 --> 00:53:35,420
Fuck off.

853
00:53:35,420 --> 00:53:38,420
If you're reading this, the bitch fell off would be good.

854
00:53:38,420 --> 00:53:40,420
Yeah, it'd be a little hard.

855
00:53:40,420 --> 00:53:42,420
Yeah, the bitch was sitting on my pubes.

856
00:53:42,420 --> 00:53:45,420
Big pubic area. Pubis.

857
00:53:45,420 --> 00:53:46,420
Ew.

858
00:53:46,420 --> 00:53:48,420
It's funny, it's area is called a pubis.

859
00:53:48,420 --> 00:53:49,420
Do men have that too?

860
00:53:49,420 --> 00:53:51,420
You should have a button that you can press and it says pubis.

861
00:53:51,420 --> 00:53:52,420
Ketchup.

862
00:53:52,420 --> 00:53:53,420
That's better.

863
00:53:53,420 --> 00:53:54,420
That's a similar enough type of thing.

864
00:53:54,420 --> 00:53:56,420
Are we going to watch the Nickelodeon Super Bowl?

865
00:53:56,420 --> 00:53:57,420
That's the plan?

866
00:53:57,420 --> 00:53:58,420
Yes, we are.

867
00:53:58,420 --> 00:54:02,660
I like to watch the Nickelodeon coverage, but Joe did kind of stab at my heart

868
00:54:02,660 --> 00:54:06,000
when he said that the commercials are going to be for kids. Joe immediately

869
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:11,140
like the Joe's over time shows going to be so good man sweet or the they're

870
00:54:11,140 --> 00:54:13,840
doing sweet victory before the whole game. They're not even doing his half

871
00:54:13,840 --> 00:54:16,420
time, so we could even catch that and then switch to the normal. It's going

872
00:54:16,420 --> 00:54:20,020
to be imagine the I mean honestly, I would really like to in giant platform

873
00:54:20,020 --> 00:54:23,340
coming out from the middle of the bubble. Who is Bob Doug

874
00:54:25,340 --> 00:54:31,740
Doug he's pass who does Nickelodeon is over. He's barely even got out by

875
00:54:31,740 --> 00:54:36,880
Disney. I thought okay, Doug comes up, goes right back into the ground because

876
00:54:36,880 --> 00:54:39,540
he doesn't belong to Nick and he that would be an incredible.

877
00:54:39,540 --> 00:54:44,400
If they brought somebody up like they're going to perform in the spring,

878
00:54:44,400 --> 00:54:50,360
they should have done that with remember last year when fifty cent was hanging

879
00:54:50,360 --> 00:54:54,000
from the ceiling like a fire, he should have just immediately gone back up. It

880
00:54:54,040 --> 00:54:58,040
just he comes down. Why did he do that? It was cool. It was kind of cool. It

881
00:54:58,040 --> 00:55:02,320
was awesome. Yeah, it was actually really. I love that last year's musical

882
00:55:02,320 --> 00:55:05,760
artist. It wasn't like one person. It was just the hip hop. All that's

883
00:55:05,760 --> 00:55:09,800
there was Rihanna, right? West. Yeah, it was. It was. Yeah, it was two years

884
00:55:09,800 --> 00:55:13,000
ago. I'm thinking two years ago. Yeah, yeah, and it was and the Rihanna

885
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:16,520
performance was she announced she was pregnant. She danced with her

886
00:55:16,520 --> 00:55:21,720
pregnant eye popping. I saw her body. It was belly popping. I know my belly.

887
00:55:21,720 --> 00:55:24,860
I felt like it was jiggling for days afterward. I forgot that we've been

888
00:55:24,860 --> 00:55:30,420
together for two Super Bowls. Yeah, yeah, that's crazy. Then we go to my old

889
00:55:30,420 --> 00:55:35,140
apartment last year for it. We watch it in my part. I made wings that I made

890
00:55:35,140 --> 00:55:39,600
wings and there was a black mold problem. Yes, and then it was one of the two

891
00:55:39,600 --> 00:55:43,200
years ago was the best one. Yeah, that was the best one. The big apartment.

892
00:55:43,200 --> 00:55:46,920
Yes, yeah, with all the millions of foods. That was amazing. This is going to

893
00:55:46,920 --> 00:55:50,320
be probably the worst one because we're in the office. Yeah, we have no couch.

894
00:55:50,340 --> 00:55:54,600
no chairs, no couch. We have chairs. This is the type of chairs we're all going to

895
00:55:54,600 --> 00:55:58,900
be sitting for for the entire for the Super Bowl man. Yeah, we have we have a

896
00:55:58,900 --> 00:56:01,860
Herman Miller around. I guess we have one or two Herman Miller's. Yeah, so you

897
00:56:01,860 --> 00:56:06,620
got to come to the office early and secure the seat. I'm going to bring I

898
00:56:06,620 --> 00:56:10,100
think I might go pick up a whole couch. You should you honestly really need to

899
00:56:10,100 --> 00:56:14,060
do that. Go pick up a can we get rid of those camp chairs? Yeah, yeah, no, no,

900
00:56:14,060 --> 00:56:17,440
no, there's still there's still two good ones, but it's fine either way. That's

901
00:56:17,440 --> 00:56:20,840
not that great. Oh, I think I want to become I think that I'm going to quit

902
00:56:20,840 --> 00:56:24,840
the podcast and become a fire watch. I watch the fire watch. It's a guy. I

903
00:56:24,840 --> 00:56:28,680
watch this guy on YouTube. Oh, they stand up. He stands up in that big

904
00:56:28,680 --> 00:56:32,200
tower. There was a woman who did that on Jeopardy. Really? Yeah, it's not

905
00:56:32,200 --> 00:56:35,240
really a full time job. It's just you do it for a summer, but apparently you

906
00:56:35,240 --> 00:56:39,560
get swarmed by ants. Yeah, I can imagine. But I want that responsibility. How

907
00:56:39,560 --> 00:56:42,840
amazing would that be to just let the fire go? I'd be swarmed by ants up and

908
00:56:42,840 --> 00:56:44,920
I think I'd have all my snacks with me.

909
00:56:45,840 --> 00:56:48,580
you bringing a bunch of sugar water, sugar water,

910
00:56:48,580 --> 00:56:52,340
maple syrup, water and that's very shallow. He bonds

911
00:56:52,340 --> 00:56:57,820
my favorite yummy midnight snack, a bowl of sugar water. Oh yeah, and a sugar

912
00:56:57,820 --> 00:57:00,920
cube. Oh, I love a sugar and a vinegar trap.

913
00:57:00,920 --> 00:57:05,960
That's amazing. Oh my God, but I if you did a job like that, do you think you'd

914
00:57:05,960 --> 00:57:11,200
get lonely? Yeah, I would love to do a lonely job for a while and then I had

915
00:57:11,220 --> 00:57:15,780
one. I had I worked at the gym in my community college and no one knew I'm

916
00:57:15,780 --> 00:57:19,780
talking about like a like you work on top of a mountain. Yeah, nobody. This is

917
00:57:19,780 --> 00:57:24,180
a different. You have to be helicopter. I worked on. I worked on top of the on

918
00:57:24,180 --> 00:57:27,580
top of the building. It was on the top. That's not on top of the building.

919
00:57:27,580 --> 00:57:32,300
Jim was not on top of the building. It was for elevation. I would love to be

920
00:57:32,300 --> 00:57:36,340
like I would love to like be, you know, I'm somehow contracted to like I they're

921
00:57:36,340 --> 00:57:41,740
you're like there's an island off the coast of Greenland and you are the only

922
00:57:41,740 --> 00:57:46,780
person who can maintain its wild life for two years. All those kinds of jobs

923
00:57:46,780 --> 00:57:50,460
are always in a lighthouse. All those kinds of jobs are always just like make

924
00:57:50,460 --> 00:57:54,700
sure that this button doesn't get yeah, make sure nothing happens yeah. Go there

925
00:57:54,700 --> 00:57:59,380
and make sure nothing ever happens. Nothing sounds exciting. It's very

926
00:57:59,380 --> 00:58:03,460
you're you're really, really want to go to Antarctica. I don't actually I've

927
00:58:03,500 --> 00:58:06,560
I'm watching a lot of north and are to go south and are so Antarctica is the

928
00:58:06,560 --> 00:58:09,980
south one, so south Antarctica, yeah, so the south one. Okay, what's the top

929
00:58:09,980 --> 00:58:11,340
one called? Arctic? There is no

930
00:58:11,340 --> 00:58:15,140
up there north. There's not nothing. There's not nothing, but there's not a

931
00:58:15,140 --> 00:58:22,060
continent. Oh yeah, but who decides this the UN the ocean fuck all that right?

932
00:58:22,060 --> 00:58:24,660
I'm not listening to it. Of course, there's stuff in the Arctic circle, but

933
00:58:24,660 --> 00:58:25,820
there's not a there's no

934
00:58:25,820 --> 00:58:27,820
there's not a come. Tell me that

935
00:58:27,820 --> 00:58:32,660
is just ice. There's no land make it. I know what that is. That's white. I

936
00:58:32,700 --> 00:58:35,960
ice okay now pick up now bring a picture of Antarctica. Give me a glass of

937
00:58:35,960 --> 00:58:38,540
water yeah. I want some land and show us a picture of Antarctica

938
00:58:38,540 --> 00:58:44,980
huh this is looking mighty familiar giant ice cubes. I've been watching all

939
00:58:44,980 --> 00:58:48,760
of these videos of so what's that lately? Oh, what's that right there? Oh

940
00:58:48,760 --> 00:58:52,000
everybody knows what black ice is they did a key and peel sketch about this,

941
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:54,960
but I really would like to go to Antarctica yeah. I don't think that you

942
00:58:54,960 --> 00:58:57,600
like that. I don't think you'd last a day there. You wouldn't in a bikini.

943
00:58:57,600 --> 00:59:02,200
Why are you realize going to Antarctica just like going to a shitty hotel?

944
00:59:02,200 --> 00:59:05,300
so the way you can't go outside, you just can't go outside. You just go to you

945
00:59:05,300 --> 00:59:08,520
just go and you live in a cafeteria hotel in a bad neighborhood, Flint,

946
00:59:08,520 --> 00:59:09,720
Michigan. Yeah, it's no

947
00:59:09,720 --> 00:59:11,440
can't go outside.

948
00:59:11,440 --> 00:59:15,020
It's that's what just what it is. You just go to a place. You go to the back

949
00:59:15,020 --> 00:59:18,200
rooms and then whenever you look out the window, you're like, oh my God, why

950
00:59:18,200 --> 00:59:21,320
would you want to go? I want to go to Hawaii or something. Well, you can go

951
00:59:21,320 --> 00:59:23,960
there, too. You don't have to only go one place. Okay, I'm going to go there

952
00:59:23,960 --> 00:59:28,000
instead. We're going to go to Hawaii and be alone. You go to Antarctica. We're

953
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:31,680
going to go to Hawaii. That's fine and we're going to fuck flowers to see us. I

954
00:59:31,720 --> 00:59:35,140
I want to I want to see a seal in person. I want to see I've watching these videos

955
00:59:35,140 --> 00:59:38,020
of seals. I do not want to see a polar bear or maybe you don't see you. You

956
00:59:38,020 --> 00:59:41,800
don't want one to see you man. Yeah, I want to see one. I don't want to be

957
00:59:41,800 --> 00:59:44,680
yeah. You want to see what you don't want to get eaten by one kill by one

958
00:59:44,680 --> 00:59:49,680
though. Do you? I know that your opposer, you don't want to get to shreds.

959
00:59:49,680 --> 00:59:54,620
Haven't you seen that movie polar bear TV show? I mean the terror. No, I

960
00:59:54,620 --> 00:59:57,920
haven't. I was thinking about watching. Is it good now? Is that the way I

961
00:59:57,920 --> 01:00:00,640
thought I figured that I figured that there's no way it could be good, but I

962
01:00:00,680 --> 01:00:04,480
saw a picture of it a couple of days ago and I saw it had it was set on a ship.

963
01:00:04,480 --> 01:00:06,640
It's based on a true expedition, but then they say

964
01:00:06,640 --> 01:00:11,520
I don't remember Shackleton. I don't know Ernest Shackleton. Who the hell

965
01:00:11,520 --> 01:00:15,580
you only watch is the guy who went to Antarctica or the north. I think

966
01:00:15,580 --> 01:00:18,840
there's some of them. They were a bunch of people went to different places all

967
01:00:18,840 --> 01:00:22,960
across history. Yeah, that's true, but do you have any interest in going

968
01:00:22,960 --> 01:00:26,320
somewhere that nobody's ever been untouched by man? I think that would be

969
01:00:26,440 --> 01:00:31,400
pretty cool to do. I think I would have to I think it would be make me freak out.

970
01:00:31,400 --> 01:00:34,440
I would not want to go. I would love to do that. I want to go to a place where

971
01:00:34,440 --> 01:00:38,140
somebody has already set up a resort. You could probably do it in America. I'm

972
01:00:38,140 --> 01:00:41,600
sure that there's somewhere that probably one square foot of land. There's probably

973
01:00:41,600 --> 01:00:45,680
more than that. I mean, America is huge. It is crazy big. They probably in the

974
01:00:45,680 --> 01:00:49,400
middle of the woods or like a desert or something. I feel like I want to go back

975
01:00:49,400 --> 01:00:53,280
to Wyoming. I spent one night there is amazing. I love I watch a movie Wyoming,

976
01:00:53,280 --> 01:00:58,020
Montana, all of these. This is where we belong. I belong in Montana. We don't

977
01:00:58,020 --> 01:01:02,280
belong in this wretched city. I love Montana, man. I need to go back so badly.

978
01:01:02,280 --> 01:01:04,980
I don't know. I think I belong here. You belong here because... I don't know how

979
01:01:04,980 --> 01:01:08,700
to drive. Well, you can't drive up and down the mountain. I don't need to. I

980
01:01:08,700 --> 01:01:11,580
don't know how to drive, but I will ride a horse. I'm a hiker type. Yeah, that's

981
01:01:11,580 --> 01:01:15,620
a good idea. I'm not a hiker. I am a hiker type. I want a backpack. I have to

982
01:01:15,620 --> 01:01:19,300
be around stuff. There's so much stuff out there. There's butterflies. Yeah, but

983
01:01:19,300 --> 01:01:23,380
I gotta be around buildings. I have to be around stuff, but I like to be not

984
01:01:23,380 --> 01:01:26,940
around stuff for a little while. Is this true? I have the opposite impulse.

985
01:01:26,940 --> 01:01:30,100
The buildings are disgusting to me. Yeah, I'm the opposite. You like the

986
01:01:30,100 --> 01:01:33,340
buildings. I like being around big buildings, yeah. Yeah, I don't like it

987
01:01:33,340 --> 01:01:36,040
either. You have a bad soul, then. I don't think I have a bad soul. I think

988
01:01:36,040 --> 01:01:40,160
greenery. Well, you have a newer soul. I was an old reincarnated soul that has

989
01:01:40,160 --> 01:01:43,300
now been... Yeah. You're a brand new one. I don't think I was ever... I don't

990
01:01:43,300 --> 01:01:46,380
think that I could have existed at any other point in time. I think one of my

991
01:01:46,400 --> 01:01:49,340
past lives I could have been on an expedition. I don't think I had any

992
01:01:49,340 --> 01:01:52,800
past life. I think you were a prairie dog that was eaten by a hawk. Yeah,

993
01:01:52,800 --> 01:01:56,360
something like that. Maybe like an animal that had no life. Yeah,

994
01:01:56,360 --> 01:02:02,600
like an animal that was a fucking door animal that had no life.

995
01:02:02,600 --> 01:02:07,960
Yeah, like a prairie dog that got eaten by a hawk or like a fly that lived on

996
01:02:07,960 --> 01:02:08,780
a piece of shit

997
01:02:08,780 --> 01:02:13,540
or like a praying mantis that got ate by his bitch. You should definitely not

998
01:02:13,580 --> 01:02:15,080
they'll ever have a past life reading.

999
01:02:15,080 --> 01:02:16,380
I would

1000
01:02:16,380 --> 01:02:20,420
and they just sit there just like, should we go? This is our sequel to a race

1001
01:02:20,420 --> 01:02:24,540
off the past life reading life reading. That is an amazing, that is fucking

1002
01:02:24,540 --> 01:02:28,860
idea. The past life reading we have. There's so many psychics around here.

1003
01:02:28,860 --> 01:02:29,700
Okay, let's

1004
01:02:29,700 --> 01:02:34,660
really in psychics around here. We can easily go to them. Do you think they'd

1005
01:02:34,660 --> 01:02:37,380
let us record them? We can, we can just, I mean, there's literally so many

1006
01:02:37,380 --> 01:02:39,700
psychics that we can go and ask each one if they

1007
01:02:40,420 --> 01:02:43,840
find one cause like a couple bucks more. My mom would go to psychics all the

1008
01:02:43,840 --> 01:02:44,580
time growing up.

1009
01:02:44,580 --> 01:02:47,020
All cold call.

1010
01:02:47,020 --> 01:02:52,320
You should see if we if we can, they can do the reading, but not tell us

1011
01:02:52,320 --> 01:02:55,700
personally and then talk to a camera talking head style. That is such a good

1012
01:02:55,700 --> 01:02:58,920
and then because then we don't know until we record that is and then we can

1013
01:02:58,920 --> 01:03:03,080
play the clip. Yeah, because I already have guesses as to my past life. Yeah,

1014
01:03:03,080 --> 01:03:06,640
we have to have a bunch of guesses. We have to oh my God, this is a great idea

1015
01:03:06,640 --> 01:03:07,900
race up to life.

1016
01:03:07,900 --> 01:03:09,140
The life

1017
01:03:09,140 --> 01:03:13,940
off who had who had the best life. My guess is and then we'll get Julio to do

1018
01:03:13,940 --> 01:03:16,860
the thing again with a chart of all the different, all every possible like

1019
01:03:16,860 --> 01:03:22,540
occupation. Yeah, we'll rank them. Oh, my God. So how do we do this again?

1020
01:03:22,540 --> 01:03:23,140
What

1021
01:03:23,140 --> 01:03:27,920
I'm gonna let kill do not the dude. If that shit happens again to me, it is

1022
01:03:27,920 --> 01:03:28,460
gonna happen.

1023
01:03:28,460 --> 01:03:34,120
Fuck man, I think my you're gonna find out that you were like the psychic is

1024
01:03:34,120 --> 01:03:36,700
gonna say something like yeah, you were a lounger yeah.

1025
01:03:36,700 --> 01:03:37,360
I

1026
01:03:37,360 --> 01:03:44,120
already don't know, or you were like a like in your past life. You were like a

1027
01:03:44,120 --> 01:03:44,680
flapper.

1028
01:03:44,680 --> 01:03:49,520
I could I could see that actually I could see you being a flat. I think I

1029
01:03:49,520 --> 01:03:52,280
think you're one of your past lives. You were the

1030
01:03:52,280 --> 01:03:57,560
teenage girl that fatty Arbuckle sat on or whatever or in the past life. I was

1031
01:03:57,560 --> 01:04:01,580
like my dad and then before that I was my grandpa. I'm so boring.

1032
01:04:01,580 --> 01:04:06,380
All right, I can't imagine I had a good I'm definitely some Irish peasant or

1033
01:04:06,420 --> 01:04:11,560
to some kind of like no. See this is you have to dog that lived in a dog that or

1034
01:04:11,560 --> 01:04:14,740
a chicken nugget chicken. You have to have the chickens that turned into

1035
01:04:14,740 --> 01:04:17,980
chicken. The one you were one of the ones who was hatched out of the egg.

1036
01:04:17,980 --> 01:04:21,380
They saw it was a man and they immediately threw it into the blender.

1037
01:04:21,380 --> 01:04:27,640
Yeah, you have to uncouple this past life from from from your your ancestry,

1038
01:04:27,640 --> 01:04:31,420
because listen your whole family. Yeah, they were Irish peasants worthless. They

1039
01:04:31,420 --> 01:04:35,820
were worthless slaves, twenty IQ. That doesn't mean that that's what you were.

1040
01:04:35,860 --> 01:04:39,160
that was just what your entire family and everything leading up to your DNA was

1041
01:04:39,160 --> 01:04:42,700
this is mysticism. Yes, you could have been Arabian,

1042
01:04:42,700 --> 01:04:44,440
maybe

1043
01:04:44,440 --> 01:04:49,680
turban. You could have worn a turban, a turban and lived in the desert. You

1044
01:04:49,680 --> 01:04:53,640
could have been a Lawrence of Arabia. Yeah, that's what I'm saying man. You

1045
01:04:53,640 --> 01:04:57,600
have to dream bit. I mean you could have been a robot or no, that's a future

1046
01:04:57,600 --> 01:04:57,900
life.

1047
01:04:57,900 --> 01:05:01,300
Yeah, it's something big like maybe like a

1048
01:05:01,300 --> 01:05:05,060
like an elephant that got shot on a teacher.

1049
01:05:05,060 --> 01:05:05,560
just

1050
01:05:05,560 --> 01:05:11,540
like a poached elephant in every single like you were captured,

1051
01:05:11,540 --> 01:05:17,940
always captured and held in captivity. Yeah, I was a giraffe that got its neck

1052
01:05:17,940 --> 01:05:18,940
cut off. Oh, my God,

1053
01:05:18,940 --> 01:05:25,540
I guess we somehow subconsciously have cloud atlas in our brain. Yeah, I don't

1054
01:05:25,540 --> 01:05:29,220
know why this is in the movie. I never saw the movie. I read the cloud atlas,

1055
01:05:29,220 --> 01:05:33,380
but I just keep I'm like a chimp that got hit with a rock

1056
01:05:34,420 --> 01:05:39,920
head. Yeah, you were the one yeah, the space odyssey. Yeah, when the bone came

1057
01:05:39,920 --> 01:05:43,100
down and the first thing ever die, cloud swag list.

1058
01:05:43,100 --> 01:05:48,380
That's your ass and I'm cloud ass list 'cause I was

1059
01:05:48,380 --> 01:05:54,300
a gay guy. No, speaking of gay motor, the leather guy in the village people,

1060
01:05:54,300 --> 01:05:57,980
only one of them that wasn't gay. What? Yeah.

1061
01:05:57,980 --> 01:06:02,700
The cop was gay? Yeah, every single other one, the leather guy. The rest of

1062
01:06:02,740 --> 01:06:06,580
them were gay. The rest of them were gay. Yeah. What the hell? Yeah, I learned this

1063
01:06:06,580 --> 01:06:10,100
the other. The leather guy. Well, that guy's funny then. Yeah, he went, he went,

1064
01:06:10,100 --> 01:06:16,260
he went way too. He did way too much. Dude, the one straight guy in the village

1065
01:06:16,260 --> 01:06:21,660
people that had to be so awesome. I bet he was getting laid. Yeah. And he got to

1066
01:06:21,660 --> 01:06:25,580
watch all them change. Yeah. You get to watch all the other guys change. He'd

1067
01:06:25,580 --> 01:06:29,100
look at them and he'd go, "Uh uh, not for me." That would have been awesome to be

1068
01:06:29,100 --> 01:06:32,300
in the village people get to watch each other change. Yeah.

1069
01:06:32,300 --> 01:06:42,700
All right, we are going on tour. We are going to Minneapolis, Detroit and

1070
01:06:42,700 --> 01:06:48,000
Carborough, and we are also going on tour with world's biggest army

1071
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:50,500
to

1072
01:06:50,500 --> 01:06:53,100
Toronto,

1073
01:06:53,100 --> 01:06:56,700
then Boston, then

1074
01:06:56,700 --> 01:06:58,800
Philadelphia, then

1075
01:06:58,800 --> 01:07:05,500
in Chicago, Atlanta and not a matter. We have a secret show planned for

1076
01:07:05,500 --> 01:07:08,040
Bar Harbor, Maine.

1077
01:07:08,040 --> 01:07:16,320
Really? I didn't know that. It's a secret from all of you. Bar Harbor,

1078
01:07:16,320 --> 01:07:19,400
Maine. I don't even know where that is. I booked a show in Bar Harbor

1079
01:07:19,400 --> 01:07:24,420
at a lobster place. Sounds cool. Is this a show or a dinner that we're

1080
01:07:24,420 --> 01:07:28,500
having? It's maybe a dinner. Okay, well then don't come to that. Tickets

1081
01:07:28,540 --> 01:07:33,180
are at swag poop dot com slash shows buy them up because my intel is telling me

1082
01:07:33,180 --> 01:07:37,820
that the Boston show is more than halfway sold out. Boston show is pretty much

1083
01:07:37,820 --> 01:07:41,140
sold out, so don't buy it. That's not true. It's getting there though, so you

1084
01:07:41,140 --> 01:07:44,300
better buy it. If you want your ticket, you better buy it because you can go

1085
01:07:44,300 --> 01:07:48,380
look to see if we have any left, but I'm telling you, you're not. You can do that,

1086
01:07:48,380 --> 01:07:52,860
but there are so buy. There are so buy. And then maybe we'll add ten more shows

1087
01:07:52,860 --> 01:07:57,180
if we sell it out. Maybe. Is that what we're gonna say? Alright, my friends, I

1088
01:07:57,220 --> 01:08:02,320
will see you at one of those shows, I think. And what will I do the rest of

1089
01:08:02,320 --> 01:08:02,740
the day?

1090
01:08:02,740 --> 01:08:07,300
I'm gonna go to Orchard. What's Orchard? It's in the north end.

1091
01:08:07,300 --> 01:08:11,720
It's a place in the north end of New York. North end is Harlem. You're talking

1092
01:08:11,720 --> 01:08:14,800
about what you're gonna do a different. I'm saying today. No, in Boston, I'm

1093
01:08:14,800 --> 01:08:17,820
gonna go to Orchard. I'm gonna go hit that up and then I'm gonna go to

1094
01:08:17,820 --> 01:08:21,400
Filibuster in Boston. Oh, we can go. Yes, Filibuster. Please tell me that

1095
01:08:21,400 --> 01:08:24,780
restaurant's still around. I hope it's still around. If I fucking, if it's not

1096
01:08:24,780 --> 01:08:28,740
there, I'm going to actually die. That's where that photo, the famous Caleb photo

1097
01:08:28,740 --> 01:08:32,660
is from. I want a $5 breakfast combo so bad. I bet they raised their prices with

1098
01:08:32,660 --> 01:08:36,380
the remember how sweet the coffee was struck by inflation. Remember you had to

1099
01:08:36,380 --> 01:08:41,060
get a coffee. They put so much sugar in it. Oh my God. I loved that. I love that

1100
01:08:41,060 --> 01:08:46,700
place. I'm going to go to this place. I used to go to all the time. Haymarket

1101
01:08:46,700 --> 01:08:51,860
station. Oh, it closes soon. Ah, fuck in 20 minutes. Well, we have very little

1102
01:08:51,860 --> 01:08:54,460
time. Let's go then. Well, bye bye.

1103
01:08:54,460 --> 01:09:01,860
This is an item on the next slide here that is called dog mating.

1104
01:09:01,860 --> 01:09:08,360
This is on Timo and I have to censor some stuff on this sleep.

1105
01:09:08,360 --> 01:09:11,860
Estrus dog toy simulation mating toy plush poodle vent fire.

1106
01:09:11,860 --> 01:09:15,360
Estrus partner mating sexual companion venting fidget dog toy.

1107
01:09:15,360 --> 01:09:16,960
Let's look at some more pictures here.

1108
01:09:16,960 --> 01:09:18,460
Next slide.

1109
01:09:19,060 --> 01:09:23,760
The features it has are simulate appearance, which is again censored.

1110
01:09:23,760 --> 01:09:30,500
That is a fleshlight hole for a dog pussy, simulated rabbit hair and a

1111
01:09:30,500 --> 01:09:33,960
suction cup base. Yeah. Now let's go to the next slide here. Let me

1112
01:09:33,960 --> 01:09:35,720
read you the description. Here's some more pictures

1113
01:09:35,720 --> 01:09:42,460
of it in use. Here's the description. Note, lubricants is not included.

1114
01:09:42,460 --> 01:09:47,140
One, dogs with estrous behavior at home, holding legs, riding over dolls,

1115
01:09:47,140 --> 01:09:50,640
making love to the air, etc. Only chasing female dogs outside and not

1116
01:09:50,640 --> 01:09:53,140
estrous behavior at home are not recommended to buy.

1117
01:09:53,140 --> 01:09:55,440
Two, dog cannot be too stupid.

1118
01:09:55,440 --> 01:09:58,940
If your dog belongs to what cannot teach, a few years will not be fixed

1119
01:09:58,940 --> 01:10:01,040
to the kind of toilet. Do not recommend to buy.

1120
01:10:01,040 --> 01:10:05,040
Okay. Three, the host needs to be patient. Dogs are emotional creatures

1121
01:10:05,040 --> 01:10:07,040
too and mating doesn't happen all the time.

1122
01:10:07,040 --> 01:10:10,340
It may not be used on the spot, but dogs with estrous behavior will use

1123
01:10:10,340 --> 01:10:13,540
it sooner or later under the patient guidance of their owners.

1124
01:10:13,540 --> 01:10:16,040
And now to the thing you spoke about about a cover-up.

1125
01:10:16,040 --> 01:10:17,340
I'd like to this next slide.

1126
01:10:17,340 --> 01:10:20,840
I'd like to read a review from this four stars color khaki.

1127
01:10:20,840 --> 01:10:23,540
The one of the photo looks bigger than the one I got might be a

1128
01:10:23,540 --> 01:10:27,440
little too small for my dog as he is bigger than this.

1129
01:10:27,440 --> 01:10:32,040

1130
