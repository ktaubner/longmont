00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:13,200
'cause uh... his because we choose

5
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:16,480
so we have a little while yeltsin yet the old one was

6
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:17,480
was a lot longer

7
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:19,480
well yeah sales and c_-one

8
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:23,120
area

9
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:25,520
we don't even need to know that it was a little bit forward

10
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:27,520
it was a delay had a uh...

11
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:31,020
loop if you ask

12
00:00:31,020 --> 00:00:33,480
so anyway what happened last time was

13
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:35,520
you guys saved

14
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:37,120
uh... rubbers

15
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:38,760
uh... all the robbers

16
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:42,240
the rebel oh yeah i'm starting to come back to my house i was at the end of the

17
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:44,120
first i think it's a rather

18
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:48,520
people i said i don't use no rubbers buddy and i guess i think i guess also

19
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:52,520
depends on the paid to find saved decided to take them on his slaves you put into

20
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:55,820
to your slave theme park as an aquarium.

21
00:00:55,820 --> 00:00:56,820
You said we slaved them.

22
00:00:56,820 --> 00:00:57,820
We slaved them.

23
00:00:57,820 --> 00:00:58,820
Yeah.

24
00:00:58,820 --> 00:00:59,820
That's what I said.

25
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:00,820
So we have a slave theme park.

26
00:01:00,820 --> 00:01:01,820
Yeah.

27
00:01:01,820 --> 00:01:02,820
Well, you've had that for a while.

28
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:03,820
Yeah.

29
00:01:03,820 --> 00:01:04,820
We already had one.

30
00:01:04,820 --> 00:01:05,820
Yeah.

31
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:06,820
We had a second brain.

32
00:01:06,820 --> 00:01:07,820
It was a -- we made a stupid --

33
00:01:07,820 --> 00:01:09,820
A sea world version of it, I thought.

34
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:10,820
Yeah.

35
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:11,820
Yeah.

36
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:12,820
Yeah.

37
00:01:12,820 --> 00:01:16,160
And so when you guys got back from saving them or --

38
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:17,160
Slaving them, yeah.

39
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:19,440
Slaving them, actually, yeah.

40
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:23,880
kind of started fighting again and then you realized that Sullivan was missing

41
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:27,760
and in the beginning of the second session you forgot that you

42
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:31,440
remembered that but you went to Gracias Mi Amigo who's the governor of Port

43
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:34,840
Virtue Good who you guys have been privateering for for the last six months

44
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:42,320
or so and he directed you to fuck you fuck me fuck me he directed you to fuck

45
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:50,800
me. He directed me to fuck you? No, fuck you. No, fuck me. Why me? Why me? Why me's

46
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:56,120
brother fuck me who you guys changed to fuck you. Okay, yeah. Yeah, it's coming

47
00:01:56,120 --> 00:02:01,120
back. Yeah. So, um, and this is the worst possible thing to come back to.

48
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:08,760
It'll be a lot simpler, I think.

49
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:10,760
I think.

50
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:12,760
So, FuckMe showed you guys

51
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:14,760
a piece of metal that he said

52
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:16,760
was from another realm. So, similar to the

53
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:18,760
Terrafire's realm, which is where you guys

54
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:20,760
decided to execute Sullivan.

55
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:22,760
There are other realms that you can go to.

56
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:24,760
Patrick Giottar quickly

57
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:26,760
ate that piece of metal, and so, through

58
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:28,760
that, he has like intense recall of everything

59
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:30,760
up from when Mount Honestoodle

60
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:32,760
exploded until now.

61
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:34,760
Like, he just has like perfect, until he

62
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:40,220
He's like perfect recall. Okay of all that total recall. Yeah total complete recall

63
00:02:40,220 --> 00:02:45,160
and than total you guys now all kind of remember Sullivan and

64
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:48,160
Fuck me told you guys

65
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:53,920
To get Sullivan you'd have to go to realms deep which is through the archipelago. That is

66
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:58,600
Virtue good archipelago, which you guys are on which is the west part. So

67
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:05,440
The trebuchet village is the same as gun city where it's shaped like a gun because it's just yeah the same landmass

68
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:09,160
Mm-hmm West a big village. Mm-hmm. The big village West is

69
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:15,680
The the virtue good archipelago that was like established by the pirate virtue good and what does that shape like?

70
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:21,180
It's just like a scatter Hawaii Island. So it's kind of like Hawaii kind of like Hawaii. Okay

71
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:25,040
Hawaii, yeah, I guess yeah. No, nothing

72
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:31,520
Well, there is hot babe Island, which we established last time and that is shaped like boobies. Oh

73
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:33,960
So talk about that later

74
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:37,280
But you guys decided that once you realize that to sail west

75
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:40,520
Well, you would have you would get to realms deep which is how you would rescue

76
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:45,320
Sullivan who died dying not in the realm he originated in means he's actually not fully dead

77
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:48,280
He's just trapped between realms

78
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:55,360
But you guys decided you actually wanted to sail as far away as possible from Sullivan and so you're gonna sail

79
00:03:56,640 --> 00:04:02,000
East as far away as possible and believing that the world is flat you

80
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,040
think you'll just get to the end of Zeebombs world and we can be as far away

81
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:09,440
from Sullivan as possible. Yeah, believing the world is flat. Yeah. We all believe

82
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:15,280
the world is not flat. Yeah, the world is not flat but nobody knows that

83
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:19,800
it's not flat for the most part. All right. Including you guys. Yeah. So it's a... I

84
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:25,880
don't know shit. Yeah and so you guys started sailing, after we figured that

85
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:33,720
head out. You guys started sailing east, back towards the Trebuchet village/Gun City, like

86
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:41,320
landmass, and you ran into a group of sirens who tried to woo you away.

87
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:43,320
Oh, yeah, Gangnam style.

88
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:47,960
Yeah, and then Patrick did a roll that I let him do that made me upset, so I just ended

89
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:51,800
the campaign, or I just ended the session very early and abruptly. But we're gonna just

90
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:55,400
say that you bested the sirens.

91
00:04:55,400 --> 00:05:00,200
was the roll again. Gangnam Style. It was Gangnam Style and I let you like do a charisma roll

92
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:04,200
that I shouldn't have let you really do but I was in a mood. Can you just explain again

93
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:08,320
what I did? It was Gangnam Style. You just you won okay? You won. Now button your shirt.

94
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:14,040
I could tell you. The shirt's half buttoned. I like your petticoat. It's just goofy. Just

95
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:17,600
button it. No you're not. It's a new style. If you want to be a cholo you have to button

96
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:22,920
just the top. Nope. He's being Napoleon. You look stupid. Put your hand back in like that.

97
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:25,960
kind of like okay you look like Napoleon actually. Yeah, it looks like Napoleon

98
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:30,320
right now. So yeah, you guys are now sailing. So here's the thing, you

99
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:34,400
guys would understand that the way the world is, there is the known like

100
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:41,640
continents are the trebuchet landmass, which is the Terrifier Kingdom and

101
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:46,680
associated like sort of smaller countries that exist with around it. Then

102
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:54,160
between that and there's two continents that are the kissing continents and then

103
00:05:54,160 --> 00:06:03,360
there's like a sea between them so have a very rudimentary map of this that I have

104
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:06,560
to I have to put a lot more details into it but like I just started it's very

105
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:12,080
like literally like nothing I'm still working on it you guys really shouldn't

106
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:17,320
be seeing this side of it yet. I already see that. I'm memorizing what's going on over there.

107
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:19,880
You guys don't know but the world's round. But this is... That kind of looks like the

108
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:27,360
old guy from Courage the Cowardly Dog. Straight up I couldn't see... I can't see it from this

109
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:33,180
side. There's too much light. So your dog drew this? Yeah, my dog drew this. And so this

110
00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:37,600
is kind of where you guys are right now. So you got a long ways to go along the coast

111
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:41,620
before you get to, and I will upload a actually good version

112
00:06:41,620 --> 00:06:44,860
of the map, one of these days into the Discord.

113
00:06:44,860 --> 00:06:46,460
And these are the Kissing Continents,

114
00:06:46,460 --> 00:06:47,740
which are known continents.

115
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:48,920
- It's kind of Africa.

116
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:52,420
- Yeah, no, I don't, maybe.

117
00:06:52,420 --> 00:06:56,740
And then this is the Kissing Sea,

118
00:06:56,740 --> 00:06:59,260
which is between the end of the Terrifier Kingdom

119
00:06:59,260 --> 00:07:00,380
and the Kissing Continents.

120
00:07:00,380 --> 00:07:01,980
- Is Africa on this map?

121
00:07:01,980 --> 00:07:02,820
- Where is Africa?

122
00:07:02,820 --> 00:07:03,740
- There is no Africa.

123
00:07:03,740 --> 00:07:05,140
- Oh, interesting.

124
00:07:05,140 --> 00:07:05,980
- Strange.

125
00:07:05,980 --> 00:07:06,820
- Wow.

126
00:07:06,820 --> 00:07:12,180
choice planet he's just getting rid of Africa Africa is like a different

127
00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:18,620
planet okay tread lightly here patches I don't think Africa is a different play

128
00:07:18,620 --> 00:07:24,060
okay seems like the right but you so you think Africa's on ebombs world and also

129
00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:31,980
I've seen a few clips of Africa bumps world so but yeah so you guys would be

130
00:07:31,980 --> 00:07:35,300
are you guys so you guys have a couple things you guys said that you were you

131
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:40,820
were thinking about dropping off your rubbers at your aquarium in the trash

132
00:07:40,820 --> 00:07:48,340
yeah if you do that you will have to either you could do that now but that

133
00:07:48,340 --> 00:07:53,380
would require some extensive land travel probably - if you dock in it is real

134
00:07:53,380 --> 00:07:58,460
which is the new brave lions nation that's called what it is real okay it is

135
00:07:58,460 --> 00:08:02,660
real mm-hmm it is real yeah and it's new brave lions nation that was carved out

136
00:08:02,660 --> 00:08:10,080
for them after the end of the last campaign. And you could dock there, they're not an easy

137
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:24,340
nation to deal with, surprise, surprise. And you could go across by land. That would take

138
00:08:24,340 --> 00:08:30,620
less time than to go around through the sea, but you would also then have to get a new

139
00:08:30,620 --> 00:08:35,420
boat like the other side of it can we can we delegate somebody like just a crew

140
00:08:35,420 --> 00:08:38,360
member to bring all the rubbers on land a we can just because I just want to be on

141
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:43,640
the boat forever yeah yeah I've got my you guys can just keep the rub like you

142
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:48,740
have enough supplies inventory where we can wait or can we just keep saying like

143
00:08:48,740 --> 00:08:52,580
oh yeah we're taking you to the your new home don't worry so what's there yeah I

144
00:08:52,580 --> 00:08:56,220
mean they're not they're pretty gullible like but you have enough food for them

145
00:08:56,220 --> 00:09:00,500
on the boat so I was about to say so you have right now you would

146
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:03,460
you probably have like a week's time before you should go to a port. Okay.

147
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:08,340
Um, and, but we're at, it is real, right? You're not in Israel. No, you're out at sea.

148
00:09:08,340 --> 00:09:13,060
You just got past the side. Why don't we just bring them to the, the theme park?

149
00:09:13,060 --> 00:09:18,980
Cause we'll have to travel across the theme park. The three park will be like weeks of like

150
00:09:18,980 --> 00:09:22,100
traveling. If not more, we just, we should just bring them with us.

151
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:28,100
We'll see them with us as extra. If the food thing is tough in, it is real

152
00:09:29,540 --> 00:09:30,980
Make a new theme park?

153
00:09:30,980 --> 00:09:32,420
Yeah, we double our income.

154
00:09:32,420 --> 00:09:36,340
The issue, the issue I would say is that, so Galaga-

155
00:09:36,340 --> 00:09:40,820
Well, they, well, okay. I don't want to say it.

156
00:09:40,820 --> 00:09:43,300
No, that's not the issue.

157
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:50,740
Technically, the rubbers are our slaves. We could make them build the theme park in It Is Real.

158
00:09:50,740 --> 00:09:56,820
The only thing is that I don't think It Is Real will like that.

159
00:09:57,540 --> 00:09:59,540
So we...

160
00:09:59,540 --> 00:10:01,540
They have to deal with that.

161
00:10:01,540 --> 00:10:03,540
Your theme park is in like near Gal Gadot.

162
00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:05,540
Like it's in the Gal Gadot area.

163
00:10:05,540 --> 00:10:07,540
Which is a very pro

164
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:09,540
terrifier, pro...

165
00:10:09,540 --> 00:10:11,540
We could do... I mean...

166
00:10:11,540 --> 00:10:13,540
Six slaves over it is real.

167
00:10:13,540 --> 00:10:15,540
We could do like an expansion thing.

168
00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:17,540
Yeah. I don't know.

169
00:10:17,540 --> 00:10:19,540
Yeah, maybe we drop... I think we should keep a bunch of them on the boat.

170
00:10:19,540 --> 00:10:21,540
Because it's nice to have extra guys around.

171
00:10:21,540 --> 00:10:23,540
And then if we run out of food or something,

172
00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:25,540
we'll eat them or throw them overboard.

173
00:10:25,540 --> 00:10:29,860
overboard okay I like that idea yeah I don't have to travel over land.

174
00:10:29,860 --> 00:10:34,360
You guys have been talking about this in front of everybody by the way. I was gonna say we do

175
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:40,480
this on the on the port so like you go into the port and it's like sandals the

176
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:46,340
port so we do like a sandals thing mmm Atlantis yeah so I would say that on the

177
00:10:46,340 --> 00:10:50,760
port of it is real. If you go south which will take a little bit longer time but

178
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:54,460
there will be port towns on the way if you go south you could probably

179
00:10:54,460 --> 00:10:58,540
probably establish them somewhere that would be less difficult to build a

180
00:10:58,540 --> 00:11:01,980
slave aquarium theme park because it would be more in line with...

181
00:11:01,980 --> 00:11:04,580
Let's do that then. Let's just go south and then build a new one.

182
00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:05,380
Yeah, let's do that.

183
00:11:05,380 --> 00:11:08,100
Well, do we have money? We're gonna need to call our girl, right?

184
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:10,340
Yeah, I mean, I think we'll have to...

185
00:11:10,340 --> 00:11:12,860
We don't need money. They're slaves. What are you gonna pay them?

186
00:11:12,860 --> 00:11:14,860
How are we gonna get all the materials, asshole?

187
00:11:14,860 --> 00:11:15,420
Just take it.

188
00:11:15,420 --> 00:11:16,780
Take it from who?

189
00:11:16,780 --> 00:11:17,980
Everyone.

190
00:11:17,980 --> 00:11:20,100
Well, there are... Yeah, I mean, there are towns you can raid.

191
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:21,380
You guys could just go pirate.

192
00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:24,140
It's fantasy world. It's like Minecraft. You can just get stuff.

193
00:11:24,140 --> 00:11:28,220
is it like minecraft patches or can we just what then what how do you how do

194
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:32,740
you mean it's you can get some wood from a tree so in that way is a lot like

195
00:11:32,740 --> 00:11:39,780
minecraft okay you sold me it's mine and the slaves do that okay you don't even

196
00:11:39,780 --> 00:11:43,500
do that but but it's Tom go this and they go get all the stuff is there

197
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:47,460
happen instantaneously it takes time we're gonna leave them and then I get

198
00:11:47,460 --> 00:11:51,460
them started so then you should pick a place so so I mean there are well

199
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:55,580
well wouldn't we I'm saying we should do it in it is real because I feel like that

200
00:11:55,580 --> 00:12:01,700
would you know it would it would forge a good relationship with us and it is real

201
00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:04,300
he just said it wouldn't he said they would not like they would hate it

202
00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:10,180
they're very anti-slavery and it is real but are they anti theme park no who's

203
00:12:10,180 --> 00:12:15,060
anti theme park yeah maybe okay maybe we build the theme park and we just said we

204
00:12:15,060 --> 00:12:18,100
set up a whole operation we make it look like we're paying like we have a very

205
00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:21,460
public thing we're like and they were like and here's your paychecks everybody

206
00:12:21,460 --> 00:12:26,380
it's a piece of it's a piece of wood and they're not getting paid so everyone in

207
00:12:26,380 --> 00:12:33,660
Israel doesn't doesn't put it on to the thing like the theme park they build a

208
00:12:33,660 --> 00:12:36,940
slide out of it so as are the people watching gonna know but it's a piece of

209
00:12:36,940 --> 00:12:44,220
wood - no it's an envelope duh Oh inside the awful there's a piece of wood

210
00:12:44,220 --> 00:12:48,940
in the envelope. Giving your building materials through envelopes. Yeah. It's not such a bad

211
00:12:48,940 --> 00:12:51,620
idea. I'm saying it's a paycheck. They'll think they're the most well-paid workers.

212
00:12:51,620 --> 00:12:55,180
Let's do that. We're gonna do that. Okay. We can't talk anymore. Yeah. So that's not

213
00:12:55,180 --> 00:12:58,660
gonna happen though for a little bit because you're-- Okay. Let's just scrap that idea.

214
00:12:58,660 --> 00:13:04,420
Well, no, no, no. I mean, you can-- so you can go on your way over there. There are--

215
00:13:04,420 --> 00:13:10,860
it'll take probably about-- it'll take probably like three or four days travel to get to--

216
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:11,700
to get to Yid Israel?

217
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:13,420
- To get to Yid Israel, to get to the coast.

218
00:13:13,420 --> 00:13:15,460
- That's fine by me.

219
00:13:15,460 --> 00:13:17,020
- Yeah, so, all right.

220
00:13:17,020 --> 00:13:18,100
You guys wanna start sailing?

221
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:19,020
- Yeah. - Let's start sailing.

222
00:13:19,020 --> 00:13:20,420
Okay.

223
00:13:20,420 --> 00:13:24,260
Yeah, so we're going to, before we do the,

224
00:13:24,260 --> 00:13:25,660
we're gonna start sailing in the midst,

225
00:13:25,660 --> 00:13:27,500
we're considering this while we're sailing.

226
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:29,900
I'm gonna familiarize you guys with your new--

227
00:13:29,900 --> 00:13:31,880
- Would the citizens of Yid Israel even know

228
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:34,860
that these robbers are our slaves?

229
00:13:34,860 --> 00:13:36,180
We could just say they're our friends.

230
00:13:36,180 --> 00:13:38,460
- That's what we already decided on.

231
00:13:38,460 --> 00:13:39,780
We're gonna say they're our employees.

232
00:13:39,780 --> 00:13:40,900
That's the whole plan.

233
00:13:40,900 --> 00:13:42,740
- Well, we don't even have to say we're gonna pay them.

234
00:13:42,740 --> 00:13:44,220
We can just say, oh, these are our friends.

235
00:13:44,220 --> 00:13:45,900
- You're just getting way too ahead of yourself.

236
00:13:45,900 --> 00:13:47,380
- Yeah, you're trying to explain the things.

237
00:13:47,380 --> 00:13:48,820
- I'm trying to tie up everything you say.

238
00:13:48,820 --> 00:13:51,660
- You try and spend 45 minutes before we even do

239
00:13:51,660 --> 00:13:53,820
a character voice. - I wanna play the game.

240
00:13:53,820 --> 00:13:57,100
- So you guys have new equipment and stuff,

241
00:13:57,100 --> 00:13:57,940
'cause you're pirates.

242
00:13:57,940 --> 00:14:02,940
So I changed, I think you two, I added some new equipment.

243
00:14:02,940 --> 00:14:05,980
I'm not sure, I think your mace,

244
00:14:05,980 --> 00:14:07,500
we're gonna change to a hook.

245
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:09,500
You're gonna have a hook hand.

246
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:11,540
You two, I added new equipment for you.

247
00:14:11,540 --> 00:14:14,160
I changed your battle axe into a big oar.

248
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:15,000
- War oar.

249
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,200
- A war oar.

250
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:17,040
I call it big oar.

251
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:18,280
- I have the Cutlass of Cortez.

252
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:20,000
- Yes, you have the Cutlass of Cortez.

253
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:20,840
- What is that?

254
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:21,660
- It's a Juni-

255
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:22,500
- It sounds cool.

256
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:23,340
- It's a homebrew.

257
00:14:23,340 --> 00:14:24,480
- That sounds cool, Patrick.

258
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:27,280
- It's a homebrew item I found online

259
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:29,280
that I like the name.

260
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:30,120
Very unique.

261
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:31,800
(laughing)

262
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:33,280
- Who is Cortez?

263
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:35,520
(laughing)

264
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:38,120
- Who the fuck is that?

265
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:40,960
- It's supposed to be Cortex from Crash Bandicoot.

266
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:43,000
- No, it says right there, cut this off Cortex.

267
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:43,840
- Yeah, it's a typo.

268
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:45,280
- And then-- - Neo Cortex.

269
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:47,780
- You guys have guns.

270
00:14:47,780 --> 00:14:48,800
- Yo.

271
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:49,640
- I shoot you.

272
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:50,480
- No.

273
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:51,320
(laughing)

274
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:52,140
- No, I'm kidding.

275
00:14:52,140 --> 00:14:55,080
- You have three guns total.

276
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:57,200
Guns are extremely rare, extremely hard to come by.

277
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:58,040
- Where's my gun?

278
00:14:58,040 --> 00:14:58,860
I don't see it in my inventory.

279
00:14:58,860 --> 00:14:59,700
- Extremely expensive, I haven't added it yet

280
00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:01,200
because those are kinda homebrew-y

281
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:03,560
and are gonna be a little more specific.

282
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:04,400
- Okay.

283
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:06,600
- But there is a musket, there's blunderbuss,

284
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:08,400
And then there's a pistol.

285
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:10,320
So, I'll explain, I mean, I don't know if you guys

286
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:12,320
are familiar with how those guns look and do.

287
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:13,800
- I do, I do know what they look like.

288
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:14,620
- I know.

289
00:15:14,620 --> 00:15:18,140
- Musket, long range, in this case.

290
00:15:18,140 --> 00:15:21,240
Slower, it has a fire rate of,

291
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:22,400
and I'll explain what fire rate means.

292
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:24,160
I made a bunch of gun mechanics.

293
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:28,840
A four, and does 1D12 damage.

294
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:33,360
It is the gun that will allow you to,

295
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:36,240
it's sort of for your ranged shooter, whoever that is.

296
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:39,200
Blunderbuss is a range of very short, 30 feet.

297
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:41,040
- I have no ranged.

298
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:44,080
- It is for forceful, you know, shooting,

299
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:45,820
like sort of shotgun kind of thing.

300
00:15:45,820 --> 00:15:47,320
Like it kind of explodes out of it.

301
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:48,600
- Like strength-based?

302
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:49,960
- Yes, pretty much.

303
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:53,100
Pistol then is more of about disarming.

304
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:55,200
It's a little bit more about being crafty.

305
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:57,060
And has the highest fire rate.

306
00:15:57,060 --> 00:15:59,240
So. - So, how many bullets?

307
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:00,080
- I would say that--

308
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:01,280
- How many bullets per minute?

309
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:02,320
A thousand?

310
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:07,320
So the way that I do guns is that you only have to deal with

311
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:12,640
reload or like missing a turn if you have a misfire.

312
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:16,280
And we'll explain what misfire is when we, later.

313
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:19,100
But, and then the fire rate is how many rolls you do.

314
00:16:19,100 --> 00:16:22,000
It'll make more sense when we get into a combat situation.

315
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,520
And I think where Cam was pointing makes sense.

316
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:28,240
- That's right, where I was pointing, Caleb.

317
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:30,000
- But you could do whatever you want, obviously.

318
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,200
You guys can talk about it in character too.

319
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:33,680
- What if we all have one blunderbuss?

320
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:36,840
- I grabbed the, yeah, I think we each get a blunderbuss.

321
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:38,280
- I don't even want a gun.

322
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:40,040
Okay.

323
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:42,840
Does anybody even care?

324
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:43,680
No, okay.

325
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:45,040
- I'm taking a blunderbuss.

326
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:46,000
- I'm taking a blunderbuss.

327
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,380
- I'll take the pistol.

328
00:16:47,380 --> 00:16:49,160
- I don't even want it.

329
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:50,960
- Okay, I'll also take the musket.

330
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:51,800
- Fine by me.

331
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:52,640
- Okay, cool.

332
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:53,920
- Can I have the musket?

333
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:55,280
- Okay.

334
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:56,120
- Thank you.

335
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:56,940
- Okay, cool.

336
00:16:56,940 --> 00:16:58,160
So you have the musket and the pistol,

337
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:00,240
and you have the blunderbuss, you have no gun.

338
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:01,840
That's fine, you have magic.

339
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:10,600
So the way that gun, we'll see how gun combat works in a second.

340
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:13,200
I mean also melee combat has been overhauled.

341
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:14,200
I...

342
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:15,200
Whoa.

343
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:16,200
Overboarded.

344
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:17,200
Come on.

345
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:18,200
Yeah, in a lot of ways.

346
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:19,760
I ain't leaning over.

347
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:20,760
I'm comfy.

348
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:21,760
I'm literally leaning over for you.

349
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:24,840
I don't know if that was going to be for me, but I'll take it.

350
00:17:24,840 --> 00:17:34,100
So in 5e there is a class called the, well it's the fighter class, but there's a subclass

351
00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:38,200
for the fighter that is the battle master.

352
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:39,720
And they have all these really cool maneuvers.

353
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:43,800
I don't know if cool is the right word, but I like them.

354
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:47,900
And I decided to just rework them so that you can do them too at any time.

355
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:54,160
And what they will be is sort of like, you'll be used, you can spend a bonus action to do

356
00:17:54,160 --> 00:18:00,680
one of these things either before or after a successful attack. So before an attack,

357
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:06,580
let's say you can do a lunge, you can prepare for a lunge, which will give you extra range,

358
00:18:06,580 --> 00:18:12,120
do extra damage, but if you miss, you'll take more damage on the next attack. But after

359
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:17,040
an attack, you can do something like a distracting strike, right? So you land a successful attack,

360
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:22,160
and then you do something to distract them, and then that can give other attackers advantage

361
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:25,280
or disadvantage. There's all these like little tricks you can do or like tripping somebody

362
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:30,240
or parrying or reposting. And I'll explain those. Like what we'll do is we're going to

363
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:33,640
end up in a we're going to end up in combat this session so that these will make more

364
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:42,760
sense. I'm scared. And and the one other thing about that, all this is that if you nail three

365
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:47,860
of these maneuvers on a target, they are then staggered, which means in the next attack

366
00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:54,340
will automatically hit for no matter what it is. So it's sort of like this idea of trying

367
00:18:54,340 --> 00:18:59,540
out all these maneuvers, getting them to fall, getting them to, you know, getting them to

368
00:18:59,540 --> 00:19:03,220
be goaded into attacking you, doing all kinds of things. And then once you kind of do that

369
00:19:03,220 --> 00:19:07,180
to them, they kind of like stagger and then whoever wants to attack them will get to have

370
00:19:07,180 --> 00:19:08,180
to automatically.

371
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:09,180
Kind of Sid Meier's Pirates.

372
00:19:09,180 --> 00:19:13,860
I love Sid Meier's Pirates. Yes, it's similar to that. It's similar to Sekiro, which I've

373
00:19:13,860 --> 00:19:17,500
been playing a lot. Then I mean, just because it has staggering, I

374
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:24,480
guess, but then with the guns, there's also special shots with

375
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:28,140
them. I took some of that from Matt Mercer's gun slinger class.

376
00:19:28,140 --> 00:19:33,140
And then also added something to make gun combat way more fun

377
00:19:33,140 --> 00:19:36,140
because I don't like the idea of just you're using a gun, it

378
00:19:36,140 --> 00:19:38,680
should be it should feel a little bit more fun. So we'll

379
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:42,140
get to that. We'll get to that. We'll get to that now actually.

380
00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:47,140
as you guys are sailing out

381
00:19:47,140 --> 00:19:49,600
who is actually where it where it's everybody on

382
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:53,980
on the royal caribbean or the caribbean royale from behind the driver's seat

383
00:19:53,980 --> 00:19:56,540
behind the kind of a guy i'm not a man

384
00:19:56,540 --> 00:20:00,100
you're in the house and the driver's seat in the back of the driver's seat you

385
00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:03,460
have somebody who typically will it would pilot the ship are you planning on

386
00:20:03,460 --> 00:20:05,420
his lap where the robbers

387
00:20:05,420 --> 00:20:06,780
you're steering the ship

388
00:20:06,780 --> 00:20:08,280
the robbers

389
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:10,780
they are i mean they're wherever you guys want them to

390
00:20:10,780 --> 00:20:14,900
to do work their stowed their barrels their stone in barrels and i'm driving

391
00:20:14,900 --> 00:20:19,300
the girls for grog in the ground here we are going to let the barrels

392
00:20:19,300 --> 00:20:22,780
what you doing i'm swinging my pistol the barrels no carrying

393
00:20:22,780 --> 00:20:25,740
when he is a senior not shooting please stop

394
00:20:25,740 --> 00:20:27,460
mhm please let us out

395
00:20:27,460 --> 00:20:29,820
man

396
00:20:29,820 --> 00:20:33,540
all if you guys don't shut up back they'll turn this whole boat around you

397
00:20:33,540 --> 00:20:36,100
do you know i'm driving back to their to

398
00:20:36,100 --> 00:20:39,660
yeah i don't know where they are the bear barrels of grog barrels could be

399
00:20:39,660 --> 00:20:42,900
anywhere that you know you know i mean it's a real sick on the deck of him

400
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:44,740
sorry yes that's what i meant

401
00:20:44,740 --> 00:20:48,620
the uh... i don't know that i did not assume that they can allow the same

402
00:20:48,620 --> 00:20:52,940
place and it's a small ship yes what is it fifteen feet long it's a lot it's a

403
00:20:52,940 --> 00:20:53,740
galleon

404
00:20:53,740 --> 00:20:57,340
uh... i don't know what i want to know and i am right so

405
00:20:57,340 --> 00:21:02,660
here there's a gallon of grog galleon of grog and all the barrels in a moment

406
00:21:02,660 --> 00:21:07,380
So all of you roll, well actually you,

407
00:21:07,380 --> 00:21:08,940
actually 'cause you're the one driving, right?

408
00:21:08,940 --> 00:21:09,780
- Yeah.

409
00:21:09,780 --> 00:21:10,660
- You're steering rather.

410
00:21:10,660 --> 00:21:12,100
And you're kind of, if you're by that,

411
00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:14,660
you're looking out, you should roll only perception right now.

412
00:21:14,660 --> 00:21:15,500
- I'm rolling perception.

413
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:17,060
- So only him.

414
00:21:17,060 --> 00:21:18,740
- Oh well, well, look at me.

415
00:21:18,740 --> 00:21:21,860
I'm about to save the day with my perception roll.

416
00:21:21,860 --> 00:21:22,700
- Oh you were pointing a gun at a barrel.

417
00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:24,560
- All right, it wasn't a good roll.

418
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:29,340
- And I got a 15.

419
00:21:29,340 --> 00:21:30,740
- 15, okay, it's pretty good.

420
00:21:31,980 --> 00:21:32,900
- 15 plus what?

421
00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:35,020
- Not so bad, it's 15.

422
00:21:35,020 --> 00:21:36,780
- Oh right, 'cause it does the math for you on the phone.

423
00:21:36,780 --> 00:21:37,620
- Yep.

424
00:21:37,620 --> 00:21:38,440
- Cool.

425
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:39,280
- Oh wait, no, 17, 'cause it does the math

426
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:40,120
for me on the phone. - Oh, let's do,

427
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:41,180
okay, wowie, wowie zowie.

428
00:21:41,180 --> 00:21:43,740
Is that true or?

429
00:21:43,740 --> 00:21:44,580
- Okay.

430
00:21:44,580 --> 00:21:45,400
- All right, so.

431
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:46,320
- I wrote a 15, but I thought it would include it

432
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:47,160
with the roll for some reason.

433
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:47,980
- Oh, it didn't?

434
00:21:47,980 --> 00:21:48,820
That's goofy.

435
00:21:48,820 --> 00:21:49,660
- No, I mean, it did underneath, right?

436
00:21:49,660 --> 00:21:50,480
- Oh, okay. - 17.

437
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:51,740
- 17, so yeah, okay.

438
00:21:51,740 --> 00:21:57,840
With that, you see the sun beating down, it's day,

439
00:21:57,840 --> 00:21:58,700
and you see some of it--

440
00:21:58,700 --> 00:21:59,540
- It's day.

441
00:21:59,540 --> 00:22:00,380
- This is day.

442
00:22:00,380 --> 00:22:01,380
(laughing)

443
00:22:01,380 --> 00:22:03,920
- Oh man, I'm so perceptive.

444
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:04,900
It is day.

445
00:22:04,900 --> 00:22:08,780
- You notice some, that sort of out in front of you,

446
00:22:08,780 --> 00:22:11,800
the light coming in from the sun is kind of refracting

447
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:16,800
and shifting among the waters, like right above the waters.

448
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:18,180
And when you get a closer look at it,

449
00:22:18,180 --> 00:22:20,740
it looks like it's in the shape of an object,

450
00:22:20,740 --> 00:22:23,440
like of a object floating on top of the water.

451
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:27,460
And as you sail a little bit further closer,

452
00:22:27,460 --> 00:22:29,140
it looks almost like a ship,

453
00:22:29,140 --> 00:22:32,400
but like a trans, almost like a transparent ship

454
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:35,620
with like sort of this like sun refracting

455
00:22:35,620 --> 00:22:36,780
and beating through it.

456
00:22:36,780 --> 00:22:40,460
And yeah, I mean, you notice that.

457
00:22:40,460 --> 00:22:45,440
- I think I need a glass of water.

458
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:49,700
- Why?

459
00:22:49,700 --> 00:22:50,760
- Just thirsty.

460
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:52,740
- Okay, yeah, you can go.

461
00:22:52,740 --> 00:22:55,140
So I mean, well, getting, you have some,

462
00:22:55,140 --> 00:22:57,780
you have water skins probably on the lower deck.

463
00:22:57,780 --> 00:22:59,860
I'm gonna go drink that, 'cause I think I'm seeing things.

464
00:22:59,860 --> 00:23:02,620
- Okay, cool, so you go downstairs and drink that.

465
00:23:02,620 --> 00:23:04,320
Now as we're getting closer to it,

466
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:09,980
I will say that you can now hear

467
00:23:09,980 --> 00:23:11,940
sort of a creaking sound.

468
00:23:11,940 --> 00:23:12,780
- Okay.

469
00:23:12,780 --> 00:23:17,340
- And I'm going to need everyone on the ship

470
00:23:17,340 --> 00:23:19,060
to roll a...

471
00:23:19,060 --> 00:23:25,180
Strength saving throw.

472
00:23:25,180 --> 00:23:27,580
- Strength saving throw.

473
00:23:27,580 --> 00:23:34,200
Strength saving throw. You could argue its constitution. It takes so long to roll.

474
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:46,140
Okay I got a dirty 20. Oh I almost had a 20 I got a 2. It rolled onto the 20. It hit the corner and then it rolled onto the 2.

475
00:23:46,140 --> 00:23:50,140
Okay. What the fuck is the physics on this stupid shit? And what about you? I got a 6.

476
00:23:50,140 --> 00:24:02,140
Okay, cool. So, something hits the ship and makes the hull nearly shatter. The force

477
00:24:02,140 --> 00:24:05,620
of it, you hear an explosion, the force of it hitting the ship, you can't see it. You

478
00:24:05,620 --> 00:24:10,260
see sort of a sheen of light kind of smash into it. I shoot my gun in a barrel.

479
00:24:10,260 --> 00:24:19,180
You hear a rubber go "Ahhhh!" and grog starts pouring out of it. You also fall over, you're

480
00:24:19,180 --> 00:24:22,740
knocked prone, you fall over, you're trying to drink the water and it spills on you

481
00:24:22,740 --> 00:24:26,180
like with Phil did earlier and you are knocked prone as well.

482
00:24:26,180 --> 00:24:39,900
Okay. You now, because you're still up, Dogen, Raw Dogen, you and you can now

483
00:24:39,900 --> 00:24:43,620
sort of make out what's happening here. What he was seeing that he

484
00:24:43,620 --> 00:24:49,900
thought was an illusion was a kind of a it was a glass ship pirate ship look

485
00:24:49,900 --> 00:24:55,820
across and you can see all these like like pirates but they're all made

486
00:24:55,820 --> 00:25:00,820
entirely of glass and they're easy we have the easiest fight of all time

487
00:25:00,820 --> 00:25:05,860
what happened to their their ship hit our ship no no no like spilled it when

488
00:25:05,860 --> 00:25:10,060
he's not a good shot probably glass cannon glass cannon mm-hmm

489
00:25:10,060 --> 00:25:14,300
Yeah. Glass cannon. And you notice them and you see that one of them is looking

490
00:25:14,300 --> 00:25:19,500
over at you and sort of and points his cutlass towards you. And it's made out of

491
00:25:19,500 --> 00:25:24,140
glass. Yeah, it's cut glass. Yes, it's made out of glass. Cut glass. And he's

492
00:25:24,140 --> 00:25:27,740
turning towards and the ship is turning towards you. So in this instance with

493
00:25:27,740 --> 00:25:31,180
ship combat, I mean you could either you can try to position yourself to

494
00:25:31,180 --> 00:25:36,620
retaliate and shoot cannons back and order your crew to do that. You can try

495
00:25:36,620 --> 00:25:40,580
try to board, start trying to board the ship and maneuver around it. It's up to

496
00:25:40,580 --> 00:25:43,200
you what you want to do since you're the one steering. I feel like it's just shoot

497
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:46,780
some cannonballs at it and it's gonna shatter. Yeah, it's a good try. It's a good

498
00:25:46,780 --> 00:25:50,460
idea. I think. You already said it was a good try which means it's not gonna work.

499
00:25:50,460 --> 00:25:54,620
No, no. You know what I meant. He slipped up. I meant to say good idea. He said good try.

500
00:25:54,620 --> 00:25:59,140
Actually I'll melt it. You'll melt it with what? The cannonballs. Okay. The heat.

501
00:25:59,140 --> 00:26:04,260
Yeah, the heat from the cannonballs. Okay, cool. So in that case you order your crew to do

502
00:26:04,260 --> 00:26:13,220
that yeah what do you say what do you do it go do what do it you see one goes you

503
00:26:13,220 --> 00:26:16,860
know what that means they all know what that means they light the cannonballs

504
00:26:16,860 --> 00:26:25,300
they make an attack on the ship I'm gonna roll a roll a sexy check

505
00:26:25,300 --> 00:26:31,940
where my D set yeah okay one it the cannons connect with the glass ship and

506
00:26:31,940 --> 00:26:34,900
And instead of shattering what you thought it might have,

507
00:26:34,900 --> 00:26:38,920
they like lodge into the ship, the cannonballs.

508
00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:40,700
- So it's plastic instead of glass?

509
00:26:40,700 --> 00:26:42,780
- Okay, so this is bullshit.

510
00:26:42,780 --> 00:26:45,080
- Well, you can see that the ship

511
00:26:45,080 --> 00:26:46,860
has sustained some kind of damage,

512
00:26:46,860 --> 00:26:48,420
but there is this sort of like,

513
00:26:48,420 --> 00:26:51,260
it's thicker than you had thought it was.

514
00:26:51,260 --> 00:26:53,220
But it is taking damage from the cannonballs.

515
00:26:53,220 --> 00:26:54,500
- It doesn't even crack?

516
00:26:54,500 --> 00:26:57,780
- Well, it's like, it like gets lodged in,

517
00:26:57,780 --> 00:26:58,620
there's cracks that are--

518
00:26:58,620 --> 00:27:01,060
- There's like a bullet and like bulletproof glass

519
00:27:01,060 --> 00:27:04,260
yes, I can I'm all right yeah like bullet glass. So what do you do to

520
00:27:04,260 --> 00:27:09,060
bulletproof glass? Don't you use or that's car glass. They have a special

521
00:27:09,060 --> 00:27:12,220
tool or you do we have that special tool. I go up and I hit that ship with

522
00:27:12,220 --> 00:27:18,860
my elbow. We're gonna die your own ship. No, that's how you turn the ship into

523
00:27:18,860 --> 00:27:25,340
you're so far from like can we ram it? Yeah, you can try. So we ram it. Can I

524
00:27:25,340 --> 00:27:29,220
do a really quick perception check to see if there's like a single little

525
00:27:29,260 --> 00:27:32,680
vulnerable spot where if I touch the entire thing I'll explode.

526
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:36,380
Yeah, you could do a, yeah, let's have you do a perception check on that.

527
00:27:36,380 --> 00:27:38,180
It's really more of an insight check.

528
00:27:38,180 --> 00:27:39,180
Let's do insight actually.

529
00:27:39,180 --> 00:27:40,180
Insight?

530
00:27:40,180 --> 00:27:43,780
Yeah, you're kind of insight into the condition of the ship, what could make it do that.

531
00:27:43,780 --> 00:27:47,300
I would say investigation, but you're not, I guess it could be investigation.

532
00:27:47,300 --> 00:27:49,620
Because you're inciting an attack.

533
00:27:49,620 --> 00:27:51,540
So I got a one.

534
00:27:51,540 --> 00:27:52,540
Okay.

535
00:27:52,540 --> 00:27:53,540
But plus two.

536
00:27:53,540 --> 00:27:54,540
Plus two.

537
00:27:54,540 --> 00:27:55,540
That's good.

538
00:27:55,540 --> 00:27:56,540
But you got a crit one.

539
00:27:56,540 --> 00:27:57,540
Yeah.

540
00:27:57,540 --> 00:28:02,860
know that ship might as well be made of. So am I still drinking water then downstairs?

541
00:28:02,860 --> 00:28:14,900
Like Wolverine. Okay. Oh man. You are drinking water still. I mean no you're not prone. You

542
00:28:14,900 --> 00:28:19,100
heard cannons going off. So yeah what do you two want to do before he steers the ship into

543
00:28:19,100 --> 00:28:25,940
the glass? Like do you guys want to? Well I put my mouth on the hole in the barrel. The

544
00:28:25,940 --> 00:28:32,860
barrel a bit of blood and a bit of grog also I would like to load myself into a

545
00:28:32,860 --> 00:28:38,180
cannon that's actually I you know what I do I'm walking up to him and I'm

546
00:28:38,180 --> 00:28:43,420
grabbing the no no actually I'm walking up to I'm walking up to Dogen mm-hmm

547
00:28:43,420 --> 00:28:48,180
give me the blunderbuss no just for one single thing no you don't want to know

548
00:28:48,180 --> 00:28:52,640
all right give me the other gun that none of us would fit in that gun give me

549
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:57,920
the gun I don't need you to fit in the gun just give it to me which gun you

550
00:28:57,920 --> 00:29:04,120
didn't even know whatever the musket the musket you would know I lost that you

551
00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:10,800
lost the money all right did you lose it no roll deception roll inside it gets

552
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:14,160
this direction now we got a crit one last time on inside there's no way I get it

553
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:29,920
again. 26. 20. Natural? Not natural. 30-20. You're both like, you have like a monster

554
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:36,120
weapon. Super raised, sort of like veins popping out of our heads. Like the scandals battle.

555
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:38,280
You're out trying to out think each other

556
00:29:38,280 --> 00:29:42,580
Fine I guess you really don't have it

557
00:29:42,580 --> 00:29:48,460
Yeah, I lost it cuz I thought so hard about it that I decided there's no way you have it

558
00:29:48,460 --> 00:29:53,000
Yep, you'd have to be seriously good at lying poking out of his shirt

559
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:59,240
That must be some kind of it's a broom it's a broom

560
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:01,560
What I thought okay

561
00:30:01,560 --> 00:30:08,180
Well, then I'm going to just load myself into a cannon and let tell one of the rubbers to fire me

562
00:30:08,180 --> 00:30:14,220
At the the glass ship. Okay, cool. I'm getting in there dog. Yes, sir

563
00:30:14,220 --> 00:30:18,920
I'll help you and it goes up to the road to the cannon and lights it

564
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:23,140
Wonder how this is gonna go. You should roll really well. Yes

565
00:30:23,140 --> 00:30:27,560
I mean awesome all will you should probably you're just gonna take damage

566
00:30:28,260 --> 00:30:34,600
What that's kind of true we have but how did evil Knievel to do it then holy shit? I even think about asshole

567
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:43,200
How did evil Knievel do it and he just did it they do it as - he doesn't hurt to fought to be shot out of a

568
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:44,340
can

569
00:30:44,340 --> 00:30:46,340
Doesn't hurt no

570
00:30:46,340 --> 00:30:50,900
Guess if they do it in Jack's just fast show where no one gets hurt makes you go fast

571
00:30:50,900 --> 00:30:55,080
Well, they didn't get hurt in that way usually when I get hurt they throw up and like cry or whatever, okay?

572
00:30:56,700 --> 00:31:01,820
happy. It doesn't hit your nuts. It doesn't hurt. It might hurt, but it's

573
00:31:01,820 --> 00:31:05,460
probably not doesn't do damage. It doesn't do damage. Yeah, right. It doesn't break skin.

574
00:31:05,460 --> 00:31:08,060
It might like hurt your feet a little bit when it's... It's like having a headache.

575
00:31:08,060 --> 00:31:11,500
Like a headache doesn't want to take away your HP, but it hurts. Yeah, it's

576
00:31:11,500 --> 00:31:15,060
anyway, I'm fine. I believe you guys. So if he lands on the ship, he will get a

577
00:31:15,060 --> 00:31:19,700
headache. That's fine by me. If that's the trade-off. That's the trade-off.

578
00:31:19,700 --> 00:31:24,300
Alright, if I land on the ship, I do get a headache. Okay, cool. But not that bad for one.

579
00:31:24,300 --> 00:31:29,660
He does damn so I'm gonna have to do is roll um I guess I have to roll dexterity for the rubber

580
00:31:29,660 --> 00:31:32,940
Mom cuz he's got a press a button well

581
00:31:32,940 --> 00:31:36,300
He's gonna unless you're are you gonna set up the cannon before I set it up perfect

582
00:31:36,300 --> 00:31:40,260
So you're gonna roll wisdom check so you roll just a wisdom just a straight wisdom check

583
00:31:40,260 --> 00:31:43,560
Religion has cuz he's got a pray that this shit works

584
00:31:43,560 --> 00:31:53,320
He's a cleric where the hell is my wisdom I found it whiz wait, that's insight right

585
00:31:54,100 --> 00:31:57,940
uh... and well it might be the same value if you don't have to conditions both of

586
00:31:57,940 --> 00:31:58,920
them right here

587
00:31:58,920 --> 00:32:01,880
and when he was inside a scroll up

588
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:04,600
you have to go to the way it is a huge

589
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:09,260
yes i don't know if there was a little early check your

590
00:32:09,260 --> 00:32:11,180
freaking boomer can use an app

591
00:32:11,180 --> 00:32:13,900
you know

592
00:32:13,900 --> 00:32:14,820
and uh...

593
00:32:14,820 --> 00:32:18,340
uses and because he's being shot at a weekend and it doesn't know how to use

594
00:32:18,340 --> 00:32:23,380
a good nineteen while okay you name that really really well you can i mean

595
00:32:23,380 --> 00:32:27,060
directly at one of the glass guys headache yeah absolutely okay and before

596
00:32:27,060 --> 00:32:31,900
and as I get in don't say headache incoming there's no

597
00:32:31,900 --> 00:32:39,580
detected a headache yours is a nerd robot what was I supposed to do just

598
00:32:39,580 --> 00:32:44,380
don't do a robot man you're supposed to be the yeah sorry the fuck ever man okay

599
00:32:44,380 --> 00:32:50,420
so I would like to cannon explosion I'm gonna hold I'm gonna hold my mace in

600
00:32:50,420 --> 00:32:54,260
front of me okay okay I don't have a sword I'm gonna hold my mace in front of

601
00:32:54,260 --> 00:32:57,140
me as I'm shot out of the cannon I'd like to aim myself directly at one of the

602
00:32:57,140 --> 00:33:00,940
glass man I was saying that the the mace was gonna be a hook and oh yeah it's a

603
00:33:00,940 --> 00:33:04,060
hook now it's even cooler look what spike all right so I'd like to aim my

604
00:33:04,060 --> 00:33:06,780
hook with spikes right at one of the guy don't you feel like a you're like a

605
00:33:06,780 --> 00:33:11,380
hooker flying at one of the guys don't you aim towards the hooker with the

606
00:33:11,380 --> 00:33:15,260
moves fool just can't is there like a dent on the ship that's made out of

607
00:33:15,260 --> 00:33:18,940
glass when you just aim for that and then

608
00:33:18,940 --> 00:33:20,420
I won't have anywhere to swim.

609
00:33:20,420 --> 00:33:21,260
Okay.

610
00:33:21,260 --> 00:33:23,280
You're gonna fly through the air.

611
00:33:23,280 --> 00:33:25,460
So you got, okay, you launch out,

612
00:33:25,460 --> 00:33:26,820
you fly through the air.

613
00:33:26,820 --> 00:33:28,700
I mean, let's do this.

614
00:33:28,700 --> 00:33:31,140
I'm afraid of heights, I die instantly in the air.

615
00:33:31,140 --> 00:33:31,980
(laughing)

616
00:33:31,980 --> 00:33:32,800
Okay.

617
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:36,020
Let me see if, I guess they're gonna roll

618
00:33:36,020 --> 00:33:36,860
dexterity saving throw.

619
00:33:36,860 --> 00:33:38,340
I'm just always doing the coolest stuff, guys.

620
00:33:38,340 --> 00:33:39,180
This is pretty cool.

621
00:33:39,180 --> 00:33:40,020
I do like this.

622
00:33:40,020 --> 00:33:40,840
You two are just like, you're shooting a barrel.

623
00:33:40,840 --> 00:33:42,060
I mean, I'm driving the ship.

624
00:33:42,060 --> 00:33:42,900
I could, I could.

625
00:33:42,900 --> 00:33:43,740
You're driving, that's awesome.

626
00:33:43,740 --> 00:33:45,140
I'm ramming a ship.

627
00:33:45,140 --> 00:33:46,700
I'm literally like flying through the sky

628
00:33:46,700 --> 00:33:48,180
with a mace in my hands.

629
00:33:48,180 --> 00:33:49,020
- It's not a mace, it's a hook.

630
00:33:49,020 --> 00:33:49,860
- Okay, good.

631
00:33:49,860 --> 00:33:50,700
- A hook in my hand.

632
00:33:50,700 --> 00:33:51,540
- So you're a hooker.

633
00:33:51,540 --> 00:33:52,360
- And I'm a hooker.

634
00:33:52,360 --> 00:33:53,200
- And that's all you got.

635
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:54,040
- You got 19 on your wisdom, right?

636
00:33:54,040 --> 00:33:54,860
- Yeah.

637
00:33:54,860 --> 00:33:55,700
- Okay, yeah.

638
00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:57,740
What's this gonna be?

639
00:33:57,740 --> 00:34:02,740
So your mace is usually what, 1D,

640
00:34:02,740 --> 00:34:05,380
is it 1D6 or 8 damage?

641
00:34:05,380 --> 00:34:08,900
- The mace is 1D6.

642
00:34:08,900 --> 00:34:09,740
- Okay, 1D6.

643
00:34:09,740 --> 00:34:14,200
Roll that, 'cause it's probably the distance.

644
00:34:14,200 --> 00:34:17,980
Roll that five, roll a D6 five times.

645
00:34:17,980 --> 00:34:18,980
A D6 five times?

646
00:34:18,980 --> 00:34:22,140
Because I'm thinking like you're probably a certain number of feet away, probably like

647
00:34:22,140 --> 00:34:25,340
30, probably 50 feet away.

648
00:34:25,340 --> 00:34:28,940
And so usually it's plus one D6 for each like 10 feet of fall damage.

649
00:34:28,940 --> 00:34:29,940
Oh yeah.

650
00:34:29,940 --> 00:34:30,940
I'm thinking of it that way.

651
00:34:30,940 --> 00:34:31,940
Quick maths.

652
00:34:31,940 --> 00:34:32,940
Let's see.

653
00:34:32,940 --> 00:34:33,940
29.

654
00:34:33,940 --> 00:34:34,940
Wow.

655
00:34:34,940 --> 00:34:36,400
Uh, yeah.

656
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:39,340
You just fucking fly through the air.

657
00:34:39,340 --> 00:34:43,300
hear like a like it's like a whistling sound because I'm going so fast yeah and

658
00:34:43,300 --> 00:34:49,500
it just shattering through this guy's head oh my wow did you guys see that oh

659

my god I didn't see it scope of my musket and I'm like wow that was awesome

660
00:34:54,180 --> 00:34:57,380
you have to roll initiative though because now you're on a ship surrounded

661
00:34:57,380 --> 00:35:01,700
by glass pirates guess what fucker I fucking got it oh and also when you

662
00:35:01,700 --> 00:35:07,660
shatter through him he shatters and then turns to sand and then falls whoa so

663
00:35:07,660 --> 00:35:14,900
fucking sand man so no no no it's just a random why do you aim for the captain I

664
00:35:14,900 --> 00:35:21,580
didn't know which one is oh my god okay well I didn't know that nobody helped me

665
00:35:21,580 --> 00:35:25,020
in any other way well he doesn't have it that's okay

666
00:35:25,020 --> 00:35:36,940
he's screaming across like a dot jumping up and down.

667
00:35:36,940 --> 00:35:40,980
All right I'm gonna yeah I got a 19 on my initiative - okay everything's going

668
00:35:40,980 --> 00:35:47,860
fucking gravy. Great so we'll come back to you you guys see evil Steve-o launch

669
00:35:47,860 --> 00:35:53,700
in the air maybe shatter a guy and then like sand kind of appearing and then go

670
00:35:53,700 --> 00:35:59,460
yeah I'm like oh he's so happy yeah I can see celebrating see him through my but

671
00:35:59,460 --> 00:36:03,580
the scope of my musket he's uh he's really in he's really loving that shit

672
00:36:03,580 --> 00:36:08,980
I like you have the scope on your musket on backwards and he's even smaller in

673
00:36:08,980 --> 00:36:13,340
the scope of your musket at me there's fucking 30 guys made of glass I'm making

674
00:36:13,340 --> 00:36:17,300
sure that you're okay and I'm looking around what would you do if I wasn't okay

675
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:22,060
what would you be doing you're sitting on a ship aiming a gun at me and I and I've

676
00:36:22,060 --> 00:36:23,060
I've been drinking

677
00:36:23,060 --> 00:36:30,900
blood. Yeah, you have been drinking yeah. Yeah, I mean do you want to steer this

678
00:36:30,900 --> 00:36:34,680
ship and try to board the ship? Otherwise, like you can do another

679
00:36:34,680 --> 00:36:40,020
maneuver as the as the wasn't I already ramming it wasn't I already doing that

680
00:36:40,020 --> 00:36:44,000
and I'm locked in and I can't not ram my ship right into where Caleb standing. Oh,

681
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,940
were you already? Where did you decide you were going to ram it? I thought that

682
00:36:46,940 --> 00:36:51,540
was what you said. Okay, I'll try board it. You need to take more. You both need

683
00:36:51,560 --> 00:36:54,960
take command and do something awesome like what I just I was okay okay then I

684
00:36:54,960 --> 00:37:01,320
ran the ship okay cool that's pretty cool so with that I would say roll okay

685
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:05,420
and I climb and why I set the ship to ramp and I climb out on the on the

686
00:37:05,420 --> 00:37:09,520
figurehead and I hold out my my war or like you like Steve was flying so your

687
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:15,720
war or I don't know if you know you will know right now okay once per long rest

688
00:37:15,720 --> 00:37:22,080
you can talk you can sort of commune with your your new god water uh-huh and

689
00:37:22,080 --> 00:37:27,720
basically cast a wave spell from your ore whoa out and that's not gonna do

690
00:37:27,720 --> 00:37:31,200
anything that ship those ships love water you can literally capsize this

691
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:37,400
thing and I just flew it and how big is the wave it's 30 feet high whoa

692
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:39,400
He fucking destroyed us, Chip.

693
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:41,400
10 feet by 10 feet.

694
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:43,400
Sorry, 10 feet like deep.

695
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:45,400
10 feet high. 6 feet.

696
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:47,400
You said it was 30 feet high. Shut the fuck up.

697
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:49,400
I thought you said it was 30 feet high.

698
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:51,400
Sorry, 10 feet wide, 10 feet deep.

699
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:53,400
I feel like that's not big enough to cap.

700
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:55,400
I won't cap size.

701
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:57,400
30 feet high and 10 feet wide for a wave?

702
00:37:57,400 --> 00:37:59,400
Oh, the other way around.

703
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:01,400
Jesus Christ.

704
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:03,400
If you aim it towards that spot

705
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:05,400
that you hit the cannonball, I think you'll hit something.

706
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:11,960
I apologize. Yeah, it's supposed to be 30 feet wide. Sorry. Yeah, 10 feet deep. I was excited.

707
00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:17,520
That'd be cool. Yeah. I don't think I feel like... If you swing the oar vertically, it

708
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:21,720
does that. If you swing it horizontally, it goes the other way. Let's do that. Okay. Well,

709
00:38:21,720 --> 00:38:25,760
I feel like that's not... It still won't probably be enough to capsize, but you can do a bunch

710
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:31,000
of damage to the people on board. You can swipe them away. I can swipe them away. Yes, well,

711
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:35,280
there is also knockback if you successfully land the attack. Oh, okay. Can I still set

712
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:38,960
the ship to ram and then do that if you want to do that you'll have to coordinate

713
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:44,520
with your um oh yeah I'll tell the boatswing do it what if you

714
00:38:44,520 --> 00:38:49,280
scurvy neck shoot the wave behind our ship so to make you go faster we surf

715
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:54,440
the wave I'm doing that ship that is fucking awesome yeah so I sir we surf

716
00:38:54,440 --> 00:38:57,800
the ship up in the air and then ours comes dead lands and smashes the other

717
00:38:57,800 --> 00:39:01,360
one in half also somebody corrected me on the discord it's like boats boats win

718
00:39:01,360 --> 00:39:06,400
or something it's not boatswain it's the way you call his boat swain is a dumb

719
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:10,080
idiot okay also if anybody knows how that word is actually pronounced you

720
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:13,600
shouldn't ever listen to them yeah I want to do the right is there probably a

721
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:19,960
freaking pirate yeah facts we got some I don't live with pirates no yeah also

722
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:25,400
boatswains or boatswains don't their fixtures mechanics it would be the um the

723
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:29,440
not the quartermaster what's their fucking name I mean it's dear or something

724
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:31,540
I mean, it doesn't matter because I'm not doing that anymore.

725
00:39:31,540 --> 00:39:33,040
I'm making a wave behind,

726
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:36,040
I'm making a wave behind slash under us to lift us up

727
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:37,640
and surf and smash into the other.

728
00:39:37,640 --> 00:39:38,480
- That's good.

729
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:41,480
Okay, 'cause I was gonna say, okay, so,

730
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:43,360
all right, so in that case, you're gonna,

731
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:44,760
'cause to do this,

732
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:46,420
I was gonna have you do an athletics check.

733
00:39:46,420 --> 00:39:47,720
You can do that with advantage now,

734
00:39:47,720 --> 00:39:50,200
to steering the ship and like making sure

735
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:51,360
that it goes into the right direction.

736
00:39:51,360 --> 00:39:52,880
- Yeah, I want the ship to lift up

737
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:54,600
like it's surfing like a surfboard.

738
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:55,840
And then I want it to smash down

739
00:39:55,840 --> 00:39:57,800
and smash the other ship completely in half.

740
00:39:57,800 --> 00:39:59,240
- Yeah, I would say do an athletics check.

741
00:39:59,240 --> 00:40:00,240
Completely in half.

742
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:01,240
Completely in half.

743
00:40:01,240 --> 00:40:02,920
That will be interesting.

744
00:40:02,920 --> 00:40:05,080
Because I'm on the fucking ship.

745
00:40:05,080 --> 00:40:06,080
And I'm gonna get fucking owned.

746
00:40:06,080 --> 00:40:07,080
Just get out of the way.

747
00:40:07,080 --> 00:40:08,080
Okay.

748
00:40:08,080 --> 00:40:09,080
Athletics.

749
00:40:09,080 --> 00:40:10,720
I didn't think about that.

750
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:12,520
You might fucking own Caleb.

751
00:40:12,520 --> 00:40:13,600
Okay.

752
00:40:13,600 --> 00:40:14,600
With advantage, right?

753
00:40:14,600 --> 00:40:15,600
Yes.

754
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:17,000
Alright, well the first roll is 21.

755
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:23,460
And then the second roll, this takes so long to roll, is 19.

756
00:40:23,460 --> 00:40:25,000
So it's 21.

757
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:26,000
Blackjack.

758
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:27,000
Whoa.

759
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:28,000
Whoa.

760
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:29,000
The pirate?

761
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:41,240
So anyway, yeah, you steer your ship, you line it up perpendicularly perfectly and it flies

762
00:40:41,240 --> 00:40:44,560
up in the air, crashes into the middle of this.

763
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:47,600
You have to roll a dexterity saving throw, evil Stievel.

764
00:40:47,600 --> 00:40:48,600
To avoid-

765
00:40:48,600 --> 00:40:50,560
Wait, does this ship have cannons?

766
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:51,560
The glass ship?

767
00:40:51,560 --> 00:40:52,560
Yes.

768
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:53,560
Oh my God, doing some Bugs Bunny bunker hill shit.

769
00:40:53,560 --> 00:40:54,560
Can I just shoot myself back?

770
00:40:54,560 --> 00:40:56,960
You want to try to shoot yourself back?

771
00:40:56,960 --> 00:40:57,960
I think I do.

772
00:40:57,960 --> 00:41:06,840
That sounds impossible. It sounds impossible. But I'm not so sure that it is.

773
00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:10,200
Okay, so here's the thing. The only way you'd really be able to do that is if

774
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:14,640
you saw the wave coming up underneath the ship and you were like, "I know what this is."

775
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:19,240
Not only did I see the wave, I saw a Musesaur. Okay? So you knew it was coming.

776
00:41:19,240 --> 00:41:22,440
And I think that we've established this before that me and Dogen have a friend

777
00:41:22,440 --> 00:41:27,480
link. Yes, we have. So what you're gonna have to do then is you're gonna have to

778
00:41:27,480 --> 00:41:32,240
run past a bunch of people who are trying to kill you.

779
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:33,080
- Yep.

780
00:41:33,080 --> 00:41:35,400
- And get into the cannon and have it lit.

781
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:39,700
So this will be a first time we're gonna discuss maneuvers

782
00:41:39,700 --> 00:41:42,080
because this would be--

783
00:41:42,080 --> 00:41:43,880
- Oh, the launch cell from cannon maneuver.

784
00:41:43,880 --> 00:41:44,720
- No, no.

785
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:46,360
- This does sound like a maneuver.

786
00:41:46,360 --> 00:41:47,200
- It's a little, it's not, that's not what I'm--

787
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:49,080
- It sounds like a whole load of maneuver,

788
00:41:49,080 --> 00:41:50,600
just out of the way.

789
00:41:50,600 --> 00:41:53,760
- So it's called the, let me find it.

790
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:55,840
It's (mumbles)

791
00:41:55,840 --> 00:41:57,120
- Where are you?

792
00:41:57,120 --> 00:41:58,320
Evasive footwork.

793
00:41:58,320 --> 00:42:00,920
So when you move, you can roll one D8

794
00:42:00,920 --> 00:42:04,400
and add that number rolled to your AC until you stop moving.

795
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:06,680
So that's something you would maybe try to move,

796
00:42:06,680 --> 00:42:09,160
try to do so that you can get past--

797
00:42:09,160 --> 00:42:10,480
- Roll one D8, you said?

798
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:11,880
- Add it and then basically,

799
00:42:11,880 --> 00:42:13,280
'cause here's what's gonna happen.

800
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:15,280
If you're running, you're gonna have to run past

801
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:17,720
at least three of these guys to get there.

802
00:42:17,720 --> 00:42:19,960
And so you're gonna wanna avoid attack of opportunities.

803
00:42:19,960 --> 00:42:21,880
- So I'm gonna roll a D8 and do what?

804
00:42:21,880 --> 00:42:24,560
- And add that to your AC.

805
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:25,440
And then we're gonna roll,

806
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:26,680
then they're gonna roll attack rolls,

807
00:42:26,680 --> 00:42:28,720
all these glass pirates.

808
00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:30,800
That's something you can do now.

809
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:31,640
- I've already done it.

810
00:42:31,640 --> 00:42:34,720
What is my, my AC is 15 and I rolled a six,

811
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:35,920
so that's a 21. - Okay, wow, 21.

812
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:38,080
Okay, so now all these guys are gonna try to attack you.

813
00:42:38,080 --> 00:42:39,680
- Blackjack. - Blackjack.

814
00:42:39,680 --> 00:42:41,400
- It's blackjack. - Blackjack.

815
00:42:41,400 --> 00:42:42,880
- I think that's fun.

816
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:44,800
- Can we get, every time we get rolled blackjack,

817
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:46,080
can we get a blackjack point?

818
00:42:46,080 --> 00:42:48,280
- And then we can cash in at the end of the campaign

819
00:42:48,280 --> 00:42:50,320
for prizes like at the Pokemon Casino.

820
00:42:50,320 --> 00:42:51,920
- You should have prizes for us.

821
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:53,320
- I should have prizes for you guys.

822
00:42:53,320 --> 00:42:54,240
(laughing)

823
00:42:54,240 --> 00:42:59,080
You should you should have at the end of every okay. I'm gonna write down to like we should earn tokens

824
00:42:59,080 --> 00:43:04,400
And you should have like bubblegum and pixie sticks and Chinese. Yes traps. I will keep track of blackjack points

825
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:09,020
Okay, I got you we got to I think we can collectively all share them

826
00:43:09,020 --> 00:43:13,560
Evasive maneuver the end we divide them all up and spend them like arcade tickets

827
00:43:13,560 --> 00:43:18,620
Okay deal cuz one of them would have hit you so you run past the guy who was immediately behind you as he was circling

828
00:43:18,620 --> 00:43:19,880
in you sort of a

829
00:43:19,880 --> 00:43:24,500
You juke him as you're running down the stairs towards where the cannons are in the hall

830
00:43:24,500 --> 00:43:27,560
There's a guy hanging in the banister waiting to stab you

831
00:43:27,560 --> 00:43:28,060
Yeah

832
00:43:28,060 --> 00:43:30,060
He goes for a stab you very easily

833
00:43:30,060 --> 00:43:35,680
sidestep it and sort of chin I go and juke him into the it's the wall and when you get to the cannon there's a

834
00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:41,380
Guy standing in front of it. Yeah, very clear. Oh, they're almost gets you you slide under him knock him up

835
00:43:41,380 --> 00:43:47,360
Yeah, a lot of cool shit, and then you jump into a cannon who's gonna light it. Is it gonna be you bugs money?

836
00:43:47,360 --> 00:43:51,720
funny. I light a match okay. You have a match. There's matches around the can.

837
00:43:51,720 --> 00:43:53,720
Of course you have. Yeah, of course. You have matches. I light a match and I

838
00:43:53,720 --> 00:43:56,840
throw it up into the air as I get into the can and it lands perfectly on the

839
00:43:56,840 --> 00:44:00,360
fuse. Fuck yeah, dude. Yeah. Okay, yeah. I'm okay with that. Okay, and then

840
00:44:00,360 --> 00:44:03,800
also because I'm going towards my friends, instead of holding my hook hand

841
00:44:03,800 --> 00:44:05,520
out, I like to hold a bouquet of flowers.

842
00:44:05,520 --> 00:44:11,480
I'll allow it. The only thing I won't allow though is this to be perfect

843
00:44:11,480 --> 00:44:15,120
without a wisdom saving throw. Buddy, you're gonna get- No wisdom saving throw.

844
00:44:15,140 --> 00:44:18,140
Wisdom ability check to aim that cannon very quickly.

845
00:44:18,140 --> 00:44:19,140
So not a saving throw.

846
00:44:19,140 --> 00:44:21,140
No, I mean this would be Wisdom or Dex I would say.

847
00:44:21,140 --> 00:44:23,140
Let me see which one I have better.

848
00:44:23,140 --> 00:44:25,140
I think Wisdom probably because you're a Cleric.

849
00:44:25,140 --> 00:44:33,140
I mean it could maybe be a combination of those two, but I'd rather just have you choose one.

850
00:44:33,140 --> 00:44:36,140
Yeah, my Wisdom is better. I'll go Wisdom.

851
00:44:36,140 --> 00:44:41,140
Alright, maybe it'll roll.

852
00:44:41,140 --> 00:44:44,140
18 plus 2, 20.

853
00:44:44,140 --> 00:44:49,340
Wow okay cool. Dirty 20. Dirty 20. Dirty 20. Dirty 20. Dirty 20.

854
00:44:49,340 --> 00:44:55,300
Yeah so you're in the glass cannon and you fly out of it with a bouquet of

855
00:44:55,300 --> 00:45:02,860
roses. Roses? No. Lilies. Lilies. That's cute. You fly past

856
00:45:02,860 --> 00:45:09,100
you fly past Dogen. Can I bite one of the flowers? Yes. No I drop them

857
00:45:09,100 --> 00:45:13,580
in your mouth. Okay, the entire book a like a dog holding a bone. They're just

858
00:45:13,580 --> 00:45:17,180
sitting in your mouth sideways. Yeah, fuck. Yeah, and you are just

859
00:45:17,180 --> 00:45:21,100
continuing to suck one in my mouth. You're sucking from the barrel. You

860
00:45:21,100 --> 00:45:25,460
said that I was in that I landed in prone position, but you got up at the

861
00:45:25,460 --> 00:45:29,220
flower goes up his. I got up. Okay, now he's still prone. Flower goes up his

862
00:45:29,220 --> 00:45:35,180
body goes. Oh, and then the flower goes. Yeah, it was a flower that didn't bloom

863
00:45:35,180 --> 00:45:37,180
yet that and it blooms and takes root in this.

864
00:45:37,180 --> 00:45:41,380
Yes,

865
00:45:41,380 --> 00:45:42,780
yes,

866
00:45:42,780 --> 00:45:43,780
that's what's happening.

867
00:45:43,780 --> 00:45:48,580
He has a fucking like this flower power for the fire flower in the

868
00:45:48,580 --> 00:45:49,880
Super Smash Brothers.

869
00:45:49,880 --> 00:45:51,680
Catch your ass.

870
00:45:51,680 --> 00:45:53,780
It gives me fire powers.

871
00:45:53,780 --> 00:45:55,080
No, that's not what it does.

872
00:45:55,080 --> 00:45:55,380
Right?

873
00:45:55,380 --> 00:45:59,280
It does damage because the flower just went up my butt.

874
00:45:59,280 --> 00:46:04,080
I jump through up onto the onto the deck.

875
00:46:04,380 --> 00:46:11,540
like Yosemite Sam I go and I go up in the direction of the boat

876
00:46:11,540 --> 00:46:20,020
wait of my dad have to go and you guys crash land on the boat doing a lot of

877
00:46:20,020 --> 00:46:24,580
damage to it it is not looking good the boat is looks like what it's not gonna

878
00:46:24,580 --> 00:46:30,060
be completely crushed we're on top of the wheel on top of the landing on a

879
00:46:30,060 --> 00:46:41,580
bulletproof glass boat so so the boat is

880
00:46:41,580 --> 00:46:44,740
under it is it's a you literally boarded

881
00:46:44,740 --> 00:46:46,980
the ship with your ship is what you guys

882
00:46:46,980 --> 00:46:49,580
so cool that is sick so yeah yeah you

883
00:46:49,580 --> 00:46:51,500
see the glass pirates and they're like

884
00:46:51,500 --> 00:46:52,980
charge and they're starting to climb

885
00:46:52,980 --> 00:46:56,420
your ship now okay I pray I do it I'd

886
00:46:56,420 --> 00:46:59,620
like vent our sewage or whatever like

887
00:46:59,620 --> 00:47:04,220
this you know like an airplane can drop all the poop I do that electricity just

888
00:47:04,220 --> 00:47:09,060
spills out on to the yeah whatever I have to do to make that now we can visible

889
00:47:09,060 --> 00:47:12,860
yeah now we can see them because they're covered in shit yeah yeah that's really

890
00:47:12,860 --> 00:47:17,420
smart thinking yeah all you guys roll initiative okay not to do it again oh

891
00:47:17,420 --> 00:47:25,620
no sorry you just can't keep your name on was 19 yeah did I roll initiative

892
00:47:25,620 --> 00:47:31,020
already. What did you get? I got a 7. That's still better than what the glass guy's got.

893
00:47:31,020 --> 00:47:39,340
I got a 13. Oh fuck yeah! Alright. Alright, so you guys have done some damage so I'm going

894
00:47:39,340 --> 00:47:44,460
to take out a few of the glass guys. Yeah, you can't tell me that none of those guys

895
00:47:44,460 --> 00:47:49,260
got it. Yeah, no you got rid of a good handful of them. Hopefully this is still somewhat

896
00:47:49,260 --> 00:47:54,260
educational about the new mechanics. But if not, you know. Oh, this was supposed to be

897
00:47:54,260 --> 00:47:58,660
an educational fight? Well to some extent. But also I have to say that also as you

898
00:47:58,660 --> 00:48:03,940
crash into the boat, where the cracks are more severe, you do see also sand.

899
00:48:03,940 --> 00:48:08,980
It's sort of turning water into sand. And you see any of the guys that have like, you know,

900
00:48:08,980 --> 00:48:12,420
when they crash, when they shatter, like when it reaches like a certain

901
00:48:12,420 --> 00:48:18,100
threshold of like how far apart their body parts have shattered, they turn to

902
00:48:18,100 --> 00:48:22,300
sand. You're saying they're bulletproof glass? They're sand

903
00:48:22,300 --> 00:48:27,780
man's there's there's sand man's sand man glass but if I were to fight them with

904
00:48:27,780 --> 00:48:33,180
my gun it will based on the ship I would say it's a bad idea yeah okay so yeah

905
00:48:33,180 --> 00:48:37,380
swing the musket like a bat is what you're saying you can do that you know

906
00:48:37,380 --> 00:48:42,900
you have a sword yeah but a sword versus class that's true it's a good point I

907
00:48:42,900 --> 00:48:47,980
mean yeah so I feel like it would do less damage and then it's not as then of

908
00:48:47,980 --> 00:48:52,660
than a bludgeoning weapon. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, that's pretty good insight there. Um,

909
00:48:52,660 --> 00:48:58,140
slashing and piercing will probably do less damage. Like I'll tell you that,

910
00:48:58,140 --> 00:49:02,300
um, then bludgeoning damage, um, which is why part of why his hook was more

911
00:49:02,300 --> 00:49:07,020
effective. Um, and part of why crashing into the ship rather than, you know,

912
00:49:07,020 --> 00:49:11,780
stabbing it with our ship. Well, literally, yes. Um,

913
00:49:11,780 --> 00:49:15,020
so anyway, you're up evil, Steve.

914
00:49:17,820 --> 00:49:21,820
I mean, I feel like I already did the coolest possible thing I can do.

915
00:49:21,820 --> 00:49:25,820
Cool. So there's the captain,

916
00:49:25,820 --> 00:49:29,820
and then there's probably like a half dozen

917
00:49:29,820 --> 00:49:33,820
other glass men that you can see. As the fight goes on,

918
00:49:33,820 --> 00:49:37,820
I'm going to also be doing roles for your crew. Okay. And if your crew

919
00:49:37,820 --> 00:49:41,820
is successful at pushing them back, their numbers that you have to fight will go

920
00:49:41,820 --> 00:49:45,820
down. If they're not successful, their numbers won't go down,

921
00:49:45,820 --> 00:49:48,240
and you'll have to reassess.

922
00:49:48,240 --> 00:49:50,580
- Let me take a look at my spells real quick.

923
00:49:50,580 --> 00:49:53,120
- Yeah, you have a whole suite of spells.

924
00:49:53,120 --> 00:50:01,480
- How deep is the ocean that we are in?

925
00:50:01,480 --> 00:50:03,920
We're right where we are,

926
00:50:03,920 --> 00:50:05,940
like how far to the bottom of the ocean?

927
00:50:05,940 --> 00:50:08,080
Are we in the deep sea?

928
00:50:08,080 --> 00:50:10,540
- I mean, you're in, it's like,

929
00:50:10,540 --> 00:50:12,220
let me actually, I should look up oceans.

930
00:50:12,220 --> 00:50:13,660
- Do you have a fire spell?

931
00:50:13,660 --> 00:50:14,820
- This thing is pretty, Patrick,

932
00:50:14,820 --> 00:50:24,940
put three Altoids in his mouth if you can tell yeah - this okay so those been

933
00:50:24,940 --> 00:50:34,340
there just today I don't know why I believe that Alex brought those here

934
00:50:34,340 --> 00:50:38,420
like months ago tell me sorry what's up why we shouldn't all be putting Altoids

935
00:50:38,420 --> 00:50:44,140
in our mouth sorry holding back holy mackerel now I feel left out I almost

936
00:50:44,140 --> 00:50:47,500
just want to pop a couple Altoids right now. It's like the worst sound in the world.

937
00:50:47,500 --> 00:50:50,620
Just so everybody talking like...

938
00:50:50,620 --> 00:50:56,500
It's fine. Listen, so basically if we could do the same thing that we

939
00:50:56,500 --> 00:51:00,540
already did and like throw our boat on top of this boat it would pretty much

940
00:51:00,540 --> 00:51:05,660
break right? Like it can it's it's over halfway done. Yeah, I...

941
00:51:05,660 --> 00:51:12,860
He's right about that. I would say... Well guess what, he doesn't have to worry about that.

942
00:51:12,860 --> 00:51:18,060
because I would like to use create or destroy water to destroy the water

943
00:51:18,060 --> 00:51:23,900
underneath this boat so that we both fall 30 feet and then it's like 30 feet of

944
00:51:23,900 --> 00:51:30,140
impact yeah our boat onto that one as it hits the second water can you just 30

945
00:51:30,140 --> 00:51:35,060
feet 30 feet by 30 feet says 30 feet I don't know that's up to you you're kind

946
00:51:35,060 --> 00:51:38,660
of the boss so either way I feel like I'm in a really good position as long as

947
00:51:38,660 --> 00:51:42,560
it's 30 feet in one direction the other dimensions gonna be anything yeah so I

948
00:51:42,560 --> 00:51:47,160
I think I think by a hundred I think that if you up cast it. I think it literally does

949
00:51:47,160 --> 00:51:50,280
Go up by like

950
00:51:50,280 --> 00:51:55,960
Let me see let me make sure before I before I commit if you get if you get to high enough level can destroy the ocean

951
00:51:55,960 --> 00:51:58,240
No

952
00:51:58,240 --> 00:52:00,240
Maybe there's wish you can

953
00:52:00,240 --> 00:52:04,360
Actually don't know all the rules around this if he's like level 100

954
00:52:04,360 --> 00:52:09,920
When we get to level 100 can we destroy the ocean you know there's no 100

955
00:52:10,240 --> 00:52:16,520
But if we get there if we did get that maybe be our blackjack points reward if we get 100 blackjack points

956
00:52:16,520 --> 00:52:21,080
Can we just 30 30 30 cubic feet that makes the most sense?

957
00:52:21,080 --> 00:52:23,440
I think for water so 30 by 30 by 30

958
00:52:23,440 --> 00:52:28,860
We can I just look at your your character sheet because for some reason I got locked out of the he's using my phone

959
00:52:28,860 --> 00:52:34,180
He's gonna text my mom. It's gonna do weird stuff. I'm gonna prank. He's looking at my photos being a funny face into here

960
00:52:34,180 --> 00:52:39,500
He's literally roasting his tongue out on Instagram says hacked. Lol. No hatch by patches

961
00:52:39,500 --> 00:52:46,500
is

962
00:52:46,500 --> 00:52:48,740
Ten gallons of water is not going to be enough.

963
00:52:48,740 --> 00:52:51,580
I did, did, did, did, did.

964
00:52:51,580 --> 00:52:52,080
Asshole.

965
00:52:52,080 --> 00:52:52,580
What?

966
00:52:52,580 --> 00:52:54,080
Is it ten gallons?

967
00:52:54,080 --> 00:52:54,580
Yes.

968
00:52:54,580 --> 00:52:55,080
Oh, fuck.

969
00:52:55,080 --> 00:52:56,880
Ten gallons?

970
00:52:56,880 --> 00:52:57,780
Yeah, that's going to--

971
00:52:57,780 --> 00:52:59,420
Where'd you get 30 feet from?

972
00:52:59,420 --> 00:53:01,460
It said 30-- oh, that's the casting-- that's the range.

973
00:53:01,460 --> 00:53:02,420
That's the range, yeah.

974
00:53:02,420 --> 00:53:02,920
All right.

975
00:53:02,920 --> 00:53:06,020
It'll just make-- the ship will just, like, shake a little bit.

976
00:53:06,020 --> 00:53:07,860
Like, whoa.

977
00:53:07,860 --> 00:53:11,500
Your boat will slide off.

978
00:53:11,500 --> 00:53:12,700
Can you create water?

979
00:53:12,700 --> 00:53:15,620
You should create water inside one of the cracks

980
00:53:15,620 --> 00:53:18,140
so it forces it open and cracks it more.

981
00:53:18,140 --> 00:53:18,980
- That's a pretty good idea, actually.

982
00:53:18,980 --> 00:53:19,820
- Yeah. - Would that work?

983
00:53:19,820 --> 00:53:20,980
- You should flush all the toilets.

984
00:53:20,980 --> 00:53:22,100
- No. - No, that wouldn't work?

985
00:53:22,100 --> 00:53:23,300
- That's not really how that works, right?

986
00:53:23,300 --> 00:53:25,100
- Yeah, no, yeah, you're right, just fucking--

987
00:53:25,100 --> 00:53:25,940
- I mean, there's a lot of stuff here

988
00:53:25,940 --> 00:53:28,220
that doesn't work how it normally works.

989
00:53:28,220 --> 00:53:30,180
- I'm gonna go for the distraction angle here.

990
00:53:30,180 --> 00:53:33,740
I'd like to use, I'm gonna cast false life on the sand

991
00:53:33,740 --> 00:53:37,420
that was created when I killed that one guy, right?

992
00:53:37,420 --> 00:53:38,700
It's still on the boat somewhere.

993
00:53:38,700 --> 00:53:39,980
I'm gonna use false life on that

994
00:53:39,980 --> 00:53:41,740
to create a beautiful glass woman.

995
00:53:41,740 --> 00:53:48,060
So false life, I think, just gives you temporary HP. I don't think that's true.

996
00:53:48,060 --> 00:53:52,760
Yeah, actually you're right. Yeah, okay, I thought that it was maybe actually

997
00:53:52,760 --> 00:53:58,740
you could just trick me. Frankenstein's monster kind of thing. What about

998
00:53:58,740 --> 00:54:02,520
guiding bolt? Could that do that? Yeah, that can't do that, but it could do a

999
00:54:02,520 --> 00:54:05,180
damage. Do you have any like illusions? Do you have any illusions? Do you have

1000
00:54:05,180 --> 00:54:11,180
a fire spell? You could merge? I take my thumb and I do like this and then I

1001
00:54:11,200 --> 00:54:13,160
I take my other thumb, I do like that,

1002
00:54:13,160 --> 00:54:15,180
and I start to kind of confuse them with the solution.

1003
00:54:15,180 --> 00:54:17,920
- Okay, you do the thumb move.

1004
00:54:17,920 --> 00:54:19,920
- Man, I'm having a hard time here.

1005
00:54:19,920 --> 00:54:22,260
Let's see, let's look at my other,

1006
00:54:22,260 --> 00:54:24,300
my in-depth test, tornado. - You can also just whack 'em.

1007
00:54:24,300 --> 00:54:25,140
- I don't wanna whack 'em.

1008
00:54:25,140 --> 00:54:26,420
I like to be a little more cerebral

1009
00:54:26,420 --> 00:54:28,700
with my D and D flying than you, maybe.

1010
00:54:28,700 --> 00:54:30,300
I guess that's probably--

1011
00:54:30,300 --> 00:54:31,440
- No, it's not a bad idea.

1012
00:54:31,440 --> 00:54:33,760
I like that you're being cerebral.

1013
00:54:33,760 --> 00:54:35,580
- I'd like to use a hammer on their head.

1014
00:54:35,580 --> 00:54:36,780
- Okay.

1015
00:54:36,780 --> 00:54:40,300
So, well, the only reason why I would even encourage melee

1016
00:54:40,300 --> 00:54:46,500
Actually no. Oh I just got a great idea. I have one pound of oil. Can I dump oil all over

1017
00:54:46,500 --> 00:54:49,500
their deck so they get all slippery?

1018
00:54:49,500 --> 00:54:58,500
I can't say no to that. You want a pound of oil?

1019
00:54:58,500 --> 00:55:02,300
Yeah one pound. I have one pound of oil.

1020
00:55:02,300 --> 00:55:04,300
I should check my inventory.

1021
00:55:04,300 --> 00:55:09,300
You guys are going to have a bunch of random shit because of the adventure kit and shit.

1022
00:55:09,300 --> 00:55:13,940
I dropped one pound of oil onto the deck of the glass.

1023
00:55:13,940 --> 00:55:15,940
The glass guy's like, "Oh no!"

1024
00:55:15,940 --> 00:55:17,140
They're not going to be able to do anything.

1025
00:55:17,140 --> 00:55:19,640
They're glass and covered in fucking oil.

1026
00:55:19,640 --> 00:55:20,640
Oh my God.

1027
00:55:20,640 --> 00:55:22,140
And I have a tinderbox.

1028
00:55:22,140 --> 00:55:23,140
Holy fucking shit.

1029
00:55:23,140 --> 00:55:24,140
What do I have here?

1030
00:55:24,140 --> 00:55:25,140
Nothing.

1031
00:55:25,140 --> 00:55:26,140
I have a musket.

1032
00:55:26,140 --> 00:55:27,140
And a torch.

1033
00:55:27,140 --> 00:55:28,140
Torch is better than tinderbox.

1034
00:55:28,140 --> 00:55:29,140
Yeah, I think so.

1035
00:55:29,140 --> 00:55:30,640
Yeah, I think that might be true.

1036
00:55:30,640 --> 00:55:32,140
I have a candle.

1037
00:55:32,140 --> 00:55:33,640
Whose turn is next?

1038
00:55:33,640 --> 00:55:36,140
Uh, so yeah, you drop oil on them.

1039
00:55:36,140 --> 00:55:37,140
Do I have to roll anything?

1040
00:55:37,140 --> 00:55:38,140
Wait, wait, wait.

1041
00:55:38,140 --> 00:55:39,140
He dropped that oil?

1042
00:55:39,140 --> 00:55:43,140
yeah he dropped that I have a bag of 1000 ball bearings really yeah

1043
00:55:43,140 --> 00:55:50,780
500 ball bearings at me sponsoring this episode

1044
00:55:50,780 --> 00:55:55,100
yeah can I change my pouch of forever dirt because I'm not a dirt and not

1045
00:55:55,100 --> 00:55:55,740
your water

1046
00:55:55,740 --> 00:56:02,820
well the forever banana peels no but we definitely have the oil in the ball

1047
00:56:02,820 --> 00:56:05,820
bearing yes I have one day of rations maybe that's all bananas

1048
00:56:06,340 --> 00:56:07,780
and

1049
00:56:07,780 --> 00:56:11,860
and it's a little bit of an excellent day for asian one day worth of the

1050
00:56:11,860 --> 00:56:13,300
minutes maybe

1051
00:56:13,300 --> 00:56:18,000
no it's not it's not you don't have been in a pilot to choose what i'm eating no

1052
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:22,340
okay so i guess i guess i guess this is a game where you'd make choices and play

1053
00:56:22,340 --> 00:56:25,740
roles i guess they're just i guess i don't have to master does it for the

1054
00:56:25,740 --> 00:56:28,100
dungeon slayings is the okay

1055
00:56:28,100 --> 00:56:31,340
and think about strong stand for slavery in this corner no

1056
00:56:31,340 --> 00:56:32,980
i think we call a mutiny

1057
00:56:32,980 --> 00:56:37,620
yeah i'm really mad i'm a captain or which one of my here a slave master

1058
00:56:37,620 --> 00:56:41,380
down at solving packages will be directed at me now

1059
00:56:41,380 --> 00:56:44,620
okay so the ball bearings in the oil around yes that it that will

1060
00:56:44,620 --> 00:56:45,380
he's

1061
00:56:45,380 --> 00:56:47,660
is your your for your okay or him

1062
00:56:47,660 --> 00:56:52,420
well so i don't know it did happen and and i will roll for after all for

1063
00:56:52,420 --> 00:56:56,020
analysts in a short period of a couple of them are gonna get affected by that is

1064
00:56:56,020 --> 00:56:59,300
before so return and it's not a good idea bananas are now

1065
00:56:59,300 --> 00:57:01,420
you cannot even

1066
00:57:01,420 --> 00:57:04,980
okay i'll i'm gonna get the oil with a torch

1068
00:57:07,980 --> 00:57:12,340
i'm gonna like the oil on the news and it was wondered which one you do

uh... yeah for sure

1070
00:57:13,740 --> 00:57:17,440
so you can light a torch you toss it down actually way i guess we're on top

1071
00:57:17,440 --> 00:57:21,140
of that ship in the rest of its made a class i was looking forward to it

1072
00:57:21,140 --> 00:57:22,940
but uh...

1073
00:57:22,940 --> 00:57:24,740

I have a bedroll, I have a big oar, I have chain mail, I have a javelin, a mess kit.

1083
00:57:59,980 --> 00:58:00,980
I don't know what that is.

1084
00:58:00,980 --> 00:58:01,980
Hold on.

1085
00:58:01,980 --> 00:58:02,980
You say a javelin?

1086
00:58:02,980 --> 00:58:03,980
I said a javelin.

1087
00:58:03,980 --> 00:58:04,980
I have five javelins.

1088
00:58:04,980 --> 00:58:05,980
Okay.

1089
00:58:05,980 --> 00:58:08,420
I have one day of rations, 20 pounds of rations it says.

1090
00:58:08,420 --> 00:58:09,780
What is water skin?

1091
00:58:09,780 --> 00:58:13,940
Reliquary, rope, hempen, shield, tinderbox, torch.

1092
00:58:13,940 --> 00:58:14,940
Where you hold water.

1093
00:58:14,940 --> 00:58:15,940
Water skin.

1094
00:58:15,940 --> 00:58:18,500
It's usually made of like animal skin or like a.

1095
00:58:18,500 --> 00:58:19,500
Okay.

1096
00:58:19,500 --> 00:58:21,500
Or like a banana peel.

1097
00:58:21,500 --> 00:58:22,500
No.

1098
00:58:22,500 --> 00:58:23,500
Okay.

1099
00:58:23,500 --> 00:58:25,500
- Okay, I guess--

1100
00:58:25,500 --> 00:58:28,980
- You have abilities, you have--

1101
00:58:28,980 --> 00:58:30,660
- You also have, okay, so here's the thing.

1102
00:58:30,660 --> 00:58:34,700
This is where you can actually use a trip attack.

1103
00:58:34,700 --> 00:58:37,100
- I just wanna throw down a slippery thing so bad.

1104
00:58:37,100 --> 00:58:37,940
- We already have two slippery things.

1105
00:58:37,940 --> 00:58:38,780
- And you're standing in my way.

1106
00:58:38,780 --> 00:58:39,600
- We don't need a three.

1107
00:58:39,600 --> 00:58:40,820
- That's why there needs to be three.

1108
00:58:40,820 --> 00:58:41,660
- I know why you want to do it.

1109
00:58:41,660 --> 00:58:43,900
- I know why you really disagree.

1110
00:58:43,900 --> 00:58:45,860
- You can do stuff like, okay, but here's the thing.

1111
00:58:45,860 --> 00:58:48,820
So there's other maneuvers that you can do instead.

1112
00:58:48,820 --> 00:58:51,300
You can go do a goading attack, right?

1113
00:58:51,300 --> 00:58:52,440
- A goaded attack.

1114
00:58:52,440 --> 00:58:57,440
right you can do something where you uh knock them prone you could do a trip

1115
00:58:57,440 --> 00:59:01,520
like tripping you could do you could do little maneuvers that can make it more

1116
00:59:01,520 --> 00:59:06,480
fun I have thaumaturgy right you have thaumaturgy yes there's a lot of

1117
00:59:06,480 --> 00:59:12,080
applications for that you could turn the oil blue maybe well no I could shout and

1118
00:59:12,080 --> 00:59:18,280
scare them and they all slip that'll do that all intimidation I'm open to it

1119
00:59:18,280 --> 00:59:23,180
it okay. I'm going to do that. Let me find the intimidation here. I'm going to

1120
00:59:23,180 --> 00:59:24,900
scare the for the shit out of them.

1121
00:59:24,900 --> 00:59:32,300
Oh, twenty four now. What do you say

1122
00:59:32,300 --> 00:59:33,800
boom?

1123
00:59:33,800 --> 00:59:41,000
So you say boo and it thunders across the sea. You feel the glass almost shake a

1124
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:41,520
little bit.

1125
00:59:41,520 --> 00:59:47,300
I should have saying note. We roll for another one. Okay, he's the singer and

1126
00:59:47,320 --> 00:59:51,760

I'm so happy.

1141
01:00:26,240 --> 01:00:27,080
- Build a thousand or something.

1142
01:00:27,080 --> 01:00:29,040
- It can hold a thousand.

1143
01:00:29,040 --> 01:00:30,080
- It drops, I drop--

1144
01:00:30,080 --> 01:00:30,920
- I'm not a 1,000 bag.

1145
01:00:30,920 --> 01:00:31,740
I'm gonna do 1,000 hold. - You know what?

1146
01:00:31,740 --> 01:00:32,580
Then I'm not gonna do that.

1147
01:00:32,580 --> 01:00:34,200
- Please just do it. - Please do it.

1148
01:00:34,200 --> 01:00:35,040
- You already did it.

1149
01:00:35,040 --> 01:00:35,880
He already rolled.

1150
01:00:35,880 --> 01:00:36,700
- Yeah, he did it.

1151
01:00:36,700 --> 01:00:37,840
- I rolled for them falling.

1152
01:00:37,840 --> 01:00:40,840
Yeah, exactly. What they do they didn't do well.

1153
01:00:40,840 --> 01:00:46,240
So did they all fall and die off and one of them one of them is not is the only

1154
01:00:46,240 --> 01:00:51,440
one who didn't fall the rest of them all fell on their ass around their butts

1155
01:00:51,440 --> 01:00:56,540
then they didn't take any damage, but they are going to they are literally

1156
01:00:56,540 --> 01:01:00,440
gonna have to use their entire movement and their action to get up. It's quite

1157
01:01:00,440 --> 01:01:04,540
a lot of damage. So let's just keep doing that 30 glass butts falling onto

1158
01:01:04,540 --> 01:01:08,040
this ship. I don't know that I just strikes me as a whole lot of pounds of

1159
01:01:08,040 --> 01:01:12,220
course 30 glass but all right well however many glass also also I should

1160
01:01:12,220 --> 01:01:17,140
say that a couple of your crew members fell as well who were fighting that we

1161
01:01:17,140 --> 01:01:21,720
have a quick fat crew member dude let's just all throw our entire inventories

1162
01:01:21,720 --> 01:01:25,660
down at the same time to try to break yeah cuz I'll be heavy it's not gonna

1163
01:01:25,660 --> 01:01:29,700
work 20 pounds of food it's not how you would breaking things work it's like you

1164
01:01:29,700 --> 01:01:33,780
need like a single force right like it's not like a okay then why don't you take

1165
01:01:33,780 --> 01:01:38,700
like a glass that glass and draw like a lot of stuff on it sit on it. Go ahead.

1166
01:01:38,700 --> 01:01:42,300
I'm not going to sit on the glass sit on it right again.

1167
01:01:42,300 --> 01:01:49,600
So you drop the ball bearings they're all falling on their their asses. They

1168
01:01:49,600 --> 01:01:53,100
have to use their full action and turn to get up actually each of them have to

1169
01:01:53,100 --> 01:01:57,180
you drop your torch in it yet. No, because I our ship will burn our ship.

1170
01:01:57,180 --> 01:01:57,620
Yes,

1171
01:01:57,620 --> 01:01:58,740
I was

1172
01:02:00,860 --> 01:02:01,700
- That's not very nice.

1173
01:02:01,700 --> 01:02:02,520
- Well, hey, I have--

1174
01:02:02,520 --> 01:02:03,660
- It would have been a crazy thing.

1175
01:02:03,660 --> 01:02:04,980
- I have an idea then.

1176
01:02:04,980 --> 01:02:08,260
- I think that we should all sing in harmony and unison.

1177
01:02:08,260 --> 01:02:12,780
- Okay, they all, three of them get up

1178
01:02:12,780 --> 01:02:14,520
and two of them stay down.

1179
01:02:14,520 --> 01:02:15,500
But the three that get up,

1180
01:02:15,500 --> 01:02:16,800
I mean, they can't do anything else.

1181
01:02:16,800 --> 01:02:17,740
That's their turn.

1182
01:02:17,740 --> 01:02:18,580
- Okay.

1183
01:02:18,580 --> 01:02:19,440
- Is getting up and trying not to fall

1184
01:02:19,440 --> 01:02:21,180
with all the oil and ball bearings.

1185
01:02:21,180 --> 01:02:22,280
- And loud noise.

1186
01:02:22,280 --> 01:02:23,120
- And the loudness.

1187
01:02:23,120 --> 01:02:24,820
(laughing)

1188
01:02:24,820 --> 01:02:25,660
- That was a big part of it, yes.

1189
01:02:25,660 --> 01:02:26,780
- That was probably the biggest, most important part.

1190
01:02:26,780 --> 01:02:28,360
- Well, that was what made the,

1191
01:02:28,360 --> 01:02:30,460
I lowered the DC based on each of the things

1192
01:02:30,460 --> 01:02:36,700
guys were doing but then yeah the guy the two of the guys are still on the ground

1193
01:02:36,700 --> 01:02:41,740
just slipping and sliding oh whoa whoa like just kind of falling over and going

1194
01:02:41,740 --> 01:02:46,860
boom and it's my turn again and it's your turn again so what if I so so that

1195
01:02:46,860 --> 01:02:50,940
so that we can throw the torch so cool I was like here's a battle where you could

1196
01:02:50,940 --> 01:02:55,740
use learn about the new mechanics you've done none of that stuff sounds one he

1197
01:02:55,740 --> 01:03:00,260
I used one no it's so much bet. This is so much better. I was I was a I honestly

1198
01:03:00,260 --> 01:03:04,440
could better creating a common. I'm gonna create a shield of water. Yeah,

1199
01:03:04,440 --> 01:03:09,260
around the bottom of the ship, so that I'm gonna create water around the ship

1200
01:03:09,260 --> 01:03:14,260
a small layer so that he can throw his torch or fill the like the poorest wood

1201
01:03:14,260 --> 01:03:17,720
of the ship or I'll fill the poorest because then it will just steam and

1202
01:03:17,720 --> 01:03:21,600
smoke. Yeah, wet wood. It won't burn. No, that's not no. So I won't put the

1203
01:03:21,600 --> 01:03:23,980
ships already wet too and so probably already like

1204
01:03:25,260 --> 01:03:27,500
there's no fire, then. Is that what you're saying?

1205
01:03:27,500 --> 01:03:31,820
No, no, I'm gonna make our ship nice and wet with create or destroy water,

1206
01:03:31,820 --> 01:03:34,560
and then he's gonna throw the torch so that our-

1207
01:03:34,560 --> 01:03:35,520
At the other ship.

1208
01:03:35,520 --> 01:03:36,540
At the other ship underneath us.

1209
01:03:36,540 --> 01:03:37,560
So it won't burn our ship.

1210
01:03:37,560 --> 01:03:38,580
And then it won't burn the box.

1211
01:03:38,580 --> 01:03:39,600
It will simply smoke.

1212
01:03:39,600 --> 01:03:42,040
It will smolder, mainly.

1213
01:03:42,040 --> 01:03:43,060
It will simply smolder.

1214
01:03:43,060 --> 01:03:44,080
At the most.

1215
01:03:44,080 --> 01:03:46,920
No, I mean, no, no.

1216
01:03:46,920 --> 01:03:50,340
Okay, all right, well, then I'd like to make a water best friend with my skill.

1217
01:03:50,340 --> 01:03:53,440
Okay, yeah, you can do that.

1218
01:03:53,440 --> 01:03:54,740
All right, I'm doing it.

1219
01:03:54,760 --> 01:03:59,020
if this is the stupid shit you want me to do something fucking awesome whatever

1220
01:03:59,020 --> 01:04:02,380
I don't want you to do all right well I just did it I cast this creator destroy

1221
01:04:02,380 --> 01:04:06,420
water and I make just a clone of myself with water but you can't do anything and

1222
01:04:06,420 --> 01:04:09,580
you may be soon to cast him he just falls to the ground is that what you want

1223
01:04:09,580 --> 01:04:14,500
okay I'm stupid and wasting my turn I'm using I use thaumaturgy and I sing at

1224
01:04:14,500 --> 01:04:19,420
the I sing a really high-pitched note a booming voice well it's not boom it's

1225
01:04:19,420 --> 01:04:23,820
much more trebly than booming. It's not very bassy. It's a high. It's so

1226
01:04:23,820 --> 01:04:28,060
point. This is can be Caleb or just look. It's like a you got to break the

1227
01:04:28,060 --> 01:04:32,620
ship. You got to break the ship. You can't make a glass ship and then not

1228
01:04:32,620 --> 01:04:36,940
let us break it. That's kind of yeah. We've done so much to try and break it.

1229
01:04:36,940 --> 01:04:40,340
That's obviously every way. First of all shoot a cannonball. That's probably

1230
01:04:40,340 --> 01:04:45,140
what that's supposed to do here. So close and you won't let me fucking come

1231
01:04:45,380 --> 01:04:49,740
it's closer it's a little close to break it's getting close I want I want you

1232
01:04:49,740 --> 01:04:52,340
guys to earn it

1233
01:04:52,340 --> 01:04:57,740
amazing speed I we dropped our ship on top of their ship and now I'm singing

1234
01:04:57,740 --> 01:05:02,420
500 ball okay fine I'm just making myself blind and deaf with blindness

1235
01:05:02,420 --> 01:05:05,780
less definitely is that what you want I'm cat that's a boy that's good because

1236
01:05:05,780 --> 01:05:09,460
this is gonna hurt your ears I'm completely blind is that what you

1237
01:05:09,460 --> 01:05:11,460
fucking one for let's see how long I'm blind in death for.

1238
01:05:11,460 --> 01:05:11,960
Okay fine.

1239
01:05:11,960 --> 01:05:14,800
A one minute, for a minute I'm blind in death.

1240
01:05:14,800 --> 01:05:15,300
Alright.

1241
01:05:15,300 --> 01:05:17,640
[siren]

1242
01:05:17,640 --> 01:05:23,060
Let's do this. If you two, you two sing, if you're combined...

1243
01:05:23,060 --> 01:05:24,440
[siren]

1244
01:05:24,440 --> 01:05:25,180
Hold on.

1245
01:05:25,180 --> 01:05:27,180
What? I'm singing really high pitched.

1246
01:05:27,180 --> 01:05:32,480
If you guys, if you guys combined a persuasion check is above...

1247
01:05:32,480 --> 01:05:37,200
32.

1248
01:05:37,200 --> 01:05:38,440
Okay.

1249
01:05:38,440 --> 01:05:39,440
Then, okay.

1250
01:05:39,440 --> 01:05:40,440
Then it breaks.

1251
01:05:40,440 --> 01:05:41,440
All right.

1252
01:05:41,440 --> 01:05:42,440
Not persuasion, sorry, performance.

1253
01:05:42,440 --> 01:05:43,440
Performance, okay.

1254
01:05:43,440 --> 01:05:44,440
I'm going to roll performance.

1255
01:05:44,440 --> 01:05:45,440
Because you're right, why not?

1256
01:05:45,440 --> 01:05:46,440
Why am I doing this?

1257
01:05:46,440 --> 01:05:47,440
That's what it's, oh.

1258
01:05:47,440 --> 01:05:48,440
What did you get?

1259
01:05:48,440 --> 01:05:49,440
I got a four, but don't worry about what number it was before I added anything to it.

1260
01:05:49,440 --> 01:05:50,440
I got a 15.

1261
01:05:50,440 --> 01:05:51,440
So you sing and it's very nice.

1262
01:05:51,440 --> 01:05:52,440
I don't think it's very nice based on the noises we were already making.

1263
01:05:52,440 --> 01:05:53,440
Yeah, I'm afraid we're done.

1264
01:05:53,440 --> 01:05:54,440
Yeah, I'm afraid we're done.

1265
01:05:54,440 --> 01:05:55,440
I'm afraid we're done.

1266
01:05:55,440 --> 01:05:56,440
I'm afraid we're done.

1267
01:05:56,440 --> 01:05:57,440
I'm afraid we're done.

1268
01:05:57,440 --> 01:05:58,440
I'm afraid we're done.

1269
01:05:58,440 --> 01:05:59,440
I'm afraid we're done.

1270
01:05:59,440 --> 01:06:00,440
I'm afraid we're done.

1271
01:06:00,440 --> 01:06:02,940
- To sing and it's very nice.

1272
01:06:02,940 --> 01:06:05,580
- I don't think it's very nice,

1273
01:06:05,580 --> 01:06:08,540
based on the noises we were already making.

1274
01:06:08,540 --> 01:06:11,220
- So I'm completely blind and deaf.

1275
01:06:11,220 --> 01:06:12,040
- Yes.

1276
01:06:12,040 --> 01:06:13,740
- Yeah, so I just, I'm not even gonna.

1277
01:06:13,740 --> 01:06:14,580
- Yeah, you don't know what's happening.

1278
01:06:14,580 --> 01:06:15,400
- I mean, it's their turn now.

1279
01:06:15,400 --> 01:06:16,620
- I'm just sitting on the ship smiling.

1280
01:06:16,620 --> 01:06:19,760
- I mean, that's also, that's a bonus action.

1281
01:06:19,760 --> 01:06:20,600
- What?

1282
01:06:20,600 --> 01:06:21,420
- To sing.

1283
01:06:21,420 --> 01:06:22,260
- That's your full action.

1284
01:06:22,260 --> 01:06:23,100
- To sing.

1285
01:06:23,100 --> 01:06:23,920
- That's your full action.

1286
01:06:23,920 --> 01:06:25,020
- Well, bonus action's speaking,

1287
01:06:25,020 --> 01:06:27,360
or free action is speaking, right?

1288
01:06:27,360 --> 01:06:29,640
So what's the difference between speaking and singing?

1289
01:06:29,640 --> 01:06:33,700
as a new arrival i guess the intent of breaking it but alright

1290
01:06:33,700 --> 01:06:36,600
all it's ok what do you want him to try to break it

1291
01:06:36,600 --> 01:06:40,520
so what do you have to say it's the way you do you know i guess all to shoot my

1292
01:06:40,520 --> 01:06:42,960
blunderbuss at the other boat

1293
01:06:42,960 --> 01:06:44,280
at the boat

1294
01:06:44,280 --> 01:06:48,040
shed whatever it's a it is a spread rate yet another guns work

1295
01:06:48,040 --> 01:06:53,540
so there's guys below you you can she also to do whatever hits the most stuff

1296
01:06:53,540 --> 01:06:57,100
so these are guy you are a secret in that uh... there's two guys were sort of

1297
01:06:57,100 --> 01:07:07,060
cluster together he aims at a crack in the ship but if we hit it perfectly it

1298
01:07:07,060 --> 01:07:11,740
would just completely explode yeah oh okay I'm gonna have the credit wonder

1299
01:07:11,740 --> 01:07:16,840
bus works the way that fall on the way that this works I'm just charging up my

1300
01:07:16,840 --> 01:07:22,340
roll okay it's a fire rate of three what does that mean that means you can roll

1301
01:07:22,340 --> 01:07:29,420
up to three times. Okay. Now, roll, when you roll, each roll you get higher than the

1302
01:07:29,420 --> 01:07:37,700
last, you add bonus damage for every two, you can have an effect if it ends below

1303
01:07:37,700 --> 01:07:40,940
if you like, you can, so you can, basically what you can do, you can roll, let's say

1304
01:07:40,940 --> 01:07:43,700
you roll and you get like a nine. Yeah. When you roll and you get a 15, that means

1305
01:07:43,700 --> 01:07:47,940
you have plus six bonus damage. Okay. Okay. Then if you roll again and you get like

1306
01:07:47,940 --> 01:07:52,940
say a 10, then it goes down to plus one bonus damage.

1307
01:07:52,940 --> 01:07:56,260
And if the 10 doesn't beat the AC,

1308
01:07:56,260 --> 01:08:01,260
then you get a one misfire on the misfire table,

1309
01:08:01,260 --> 01:08:05,300
which means that next round your fire rate is only one.

1310
01:08:05,300 --> 01:08:06,180
That's like what happens.

1311
01:08:06,180 --> 01:08:07,940
If you roll--

1312
01:08:07,940 --> 01:08:10,500
- So it's better to have a low fire rate.

1313
01:08:10,500 --> 01:08:12,140
- Well, if you fail.

1314
01:08:12,140 --> 01:08:14,320
- Yeah, but the higher the fire rate is,

1315
01:08:14,320 --> 01:08:16,260
the way easier it is to fail though.

1316
01:08:16,260 --> 01:08:18,040
but also the better the damage is

1317
01:08:18,040 --> 01:08:19,940
and the more effects you get.

1318
01:08:19,940 --> 01:08:21,980
- You gotta get higher every roll though?

1319
01:08:21,980 --> 01:08:22,820
All right, three.

1320
01:08:22,820 --> 01:08:24,660
- You can also stop after.

1321
01:08:24,660 --> 01:08:25,500
- Oh, you can stop.

1322
01:08:25,500 --> 01:08:26,320
- You can stop.

1323
01:08:26,320 --> 01:08:27,160
- Oh, okay, I didn't know that.

1324
01:08:27,160 --> 01:08:27,980
- Blackjack.

1325
01:08:27,980 --> 01:08:28,860
- Blackjack, okay.

1326
01:08:28,860 --> 01:08:32,180
That's a 17.

1327
01:08:32,180 --> 01:08:33,860
I think I'm stopping.

1328
01:08:33,860 --> 01:08:34,700
- He's upstairs.

1329
01:08:34,700 --> 01:08:36,460
- Yeah, I think I stop at a 17.

1330
01:08:36,460 --> 01:08:37,420
- Wait, but don't you add?

1331
01:08:37,420 --> 01:08:38,660
- Yeah, do I add anything?

1332
01:08:38,660 --> 01:08:39,500
- No, that's the thing.

1333
01:08:39,500 --> 01:08:40,460
- Okay, that's 17.

1334
01:08:40,460 --> 01:08:41,280
- Okay, cool.

1335
01:08:41,280 --> 01:08:42,820
Yeah, that hits, obviously.

1336
01:08:42,820 --> 01:08:43,660
Roll. - Obviously.

1337
01:08:43,660 --> 01:08:45,260
- Obviously, obviously.

1338
01:08:45,260 --> 01:08:46,300
Roll 3D4.

1339
01:08:46,300 --> 01:08:48,980
- 3D4, okay, hold on here.

1340
01:08:48,980 --> 01:08:51,340
- You just get three of the triangles out here.

1341
01:08:51,340 --> 01:08:53,260
Dem, dem triangles.

1342
01:08:53,260 --> 01:08:54,380
- No, I got it right here.

1343
01:08:54,380 --> 01:08:55,940
It's rolling.

1344
01:08:55,940 --> 01:08:57,220
It's loading.

1345
01:08:57,220 --> 01:08:58,460
Oh my God, it's four.

1346
01:08:58,460 --> 01:09:00,460
- It's four damage?

1347
01:09:00,460 --> 01:09:01,280
- It's four damage.

1348
01:09:01,280 --> 01:09:03,340
- It's four damage, yeah, you just shoot it out.

1349
01:09:03,340 --> 01:09:04,620
It just sort of like,

1350
01:09:04,620 --> 01:09:07,420
like sort of splatters on the captain

1351
01:09:07,420 --> 01:09:08,260
and his first aid spaces.

1352
01:09:08,260 --> 01:09:09,620
- Splatter, is this a slime gun?

1353
01:09:09,620 --> 01:09:11,460
- No, 'cause it's just like a, you know,

1354
01:09:11,460 --> 01:09:12,300
the blunderbuss is kinda like--

1355
01:09:12,300 --> 01:09:13,940
- What is this, a water gun?

1356
01:09:13,940 --> 01:09:14,980
- Yeah, is it a water gun?

1357
01:09:14,980 --> 01:09:15,820
Answer.

1358
01:09:15,820 --> 01:09:17,260
- And it does bang into the ship,

1359
01:09:17,260 --> 01:09:19,780
it does, but it doesn't do a lot of damage to the ship.

1360
01:09:19,780 --> 01:09:22,340
- A little, one little more crack appears.

1361
01:09:22,340 --> 01:09:23,180
Okay, that's good enough for me.

1362
01:09:23,180 --> 01:09:24,300
- But not a lot.

1363
01:09:24,300 --> 01:09:25,620
- That's good enough for me.

1364
01:09:25,620 --> 01:09:27,220
- There is a way, there's a window.

1365
01:09:27,220 --> 01:09:28,060
- One little crack.

1366
01:09:28,060 --> 01:09:29,940
- There's a way you, but there's not,

1367
01:09:29,940 --> 01:09:31,180
not a way you can break it.

1368
01:09:31,180 --> 01:09:34,060
That was, that was part of it.

1369
01:09:34,060 --> 01:09:35,820
So that that was a possibility.

1370
01:09:35,820 --> 01:09:38,620
- Stick something into the crack.

1371
01:09:38,620 --> 01:09:39,460
- You're up, Pat.

1372
01:09:41,940 --> 01:09:44,460
stick something into the crack

1373
01:09:44,460 --> 01:09:47,860
no don't sing we already sang

1374
01:09:47,860 --> 01:09:50,700
we could have worked

1375
01:09:50,700 --> 01:09:53,980
stick your sword in the crack

1376
01:09:53,980 --> 01:09:57,300
i don't know about the sword, maybe the end of the musket

1377
01:09:57,300 --> 01:10:01,780
i wish i still had my mace my mace my mace

1378
01:10:01,780 --> 01:10:03,020
your hook is basically a mace

1379
01:10:03,020 --> 01:10:08,020
it has a crowbar it has the weight to it

1380
01:10:08,020 --> 01:10:09,740
i was just reskinning it

1381
01:10:09,740 --> 01:10:11,780
i have a crowbar

1382
01:10:11,780 --> 01:10:18,500
pry that shit open well where am I'm still on the the wooden ship yes so I

1383
01:10:18,500 --> 01:10:21,100
could jump

1384
01:10:21,100 --> 01:10:32,100
jump jump jump jump jump jump jump jump jump jump jump jump jump jump jump jump

1385
01:10:32,100 --> 01:10:36,100
Patrick look at me do it. Do it. Do it.

1386
01:10:36,100 --> 01:10:38,100
Just seals up around him. Do it.

1387
01:10:38,100 --> 01:10:41,100
Jump. Do a fucking M bison jump.

1388
01:10:41,100 --> 01:10:45,100
We will save you. We got you. No matter what happens to you we will get you out of that water.

1389
01:10:45,100 --> 01:10:47,100
Jump dude.

1390
01:10:49,100 --> 01:10:52,720
Do I have you're looking down from the from the tallest diving board at the pool?

1391
01:10:52,720 --> 01:10:56,900
Okay, and if you jump off this thing you will be fucking legendary. We'll give you all

1392
01:10:56,900 --> 01:11:03,780
Which I can use to look at the crack in the ship and find its weak point jump into the crack

1393
01:11:03,780 --> 01:11:08,480
I don't we don't we mean with the eye for detail exactly that you can use a bonus action to make a perception check to

1394
01:11:08,480 --> 01:11:13,900
Check a spot a hidden creature or object to make an investigation check to uncover or decipher clues

1395
01:11:15,900 --> 01:11:21,280
I'll let that be that I like that. It's the clue of where the ship will break. Yes. I like that

1396
01:11:21,280 --> 01:11:23,780
So what is that? What kind of role is that?

1397
01:11:23,780 --> 01:11:26,220
that is a

1398
01:11:26,220 --> 01:11:28,700
Do you ask too many questions?

1399
01:11:28,700 --> 01:11:32,340
You just let it happen. I'm sorry that is a

1400
01:11:32,340 --> 01:11:40,880
Perception check. Okay. Sorry. Yeah, mr. I bet you said that. Okay. Yeah, so perception check. I will roll perception. I

1401
01:11:42,200 --> 01:11:48,120
I will do it now. Do it now. Where is that? Oh wait, that's not under. Okay, hold up.

1402
01:11:48,120 --> 01:11:57,560
Takes so long.

1403
01:11:57,560 --> 01:12:01,020
Boy.

1404
01:12:01,020 --> 01:12:08,680
I take this opportunity to take my hoodie off. Hey guys. What? Oh, sorry.

1405
01:12:11,560 --> 01:12:17,640
That's a do I get advantage say the number we've been waiting for a full

1406
01:12:17,640 --> 01:12:24,680
minute. I got an 11. 11. You can tell that the general area where it is, but

1407
01:12:24,680 --> 01:12:29,320
you can't tell the exact area. Like the area where it's already where the most

1408
01:12:29,320 --> 01:12:34,840
weight of the ship has been on and then a bit to the towards the helm of the

1409
01:12:34,840 --> 01:12:40,440
glass ship. There's a you could see that in that area there's like probably has

1410
01:12:40,440 --> 01:12:45,400
the most give. Okay. But you can't quite, like if you jumped off and tried to like

1411
01:12:45,400 --> 01:12:49,600
just pile drive it with the crowbar you can't guarantee that you'd be able to

1412
01:12:49,600 --> 01:12:59,240
actually drive something home here. Then I'm gonna try and sing. You, if it's just

1413
01:12:59,240 --> 01:13:03,840
you singing. Oh my god we already sang we literally already did it. What's your

1414
01:13:03,840 --> 01:13:12,280
performance again my performance is huge right plus seven wow fuck me um well

1415
01:13:12,280 --> 01:13:17,480
that's one of the characters you should you'll yeah just roll we'll see what it

1416
01:13:17,480 --> 01:13:29,060
does 16 you guys just keep sinking on top you guys crashed on this guy people

1417
01:13:29,060 --> 01:13:32,880
shipping just keep sinking yeah cuz I can't believe that we should have

1418
01:13:32,880 --> 01:13:37,040
already broken. All right. Uh, they're up.

1419
01:13:37,040 --> 01:13:39,680
I'm singing. We're singing cause we're celebrating cause we thought it did

1420
01:13:39,680 --> 01:13:44,680
break. Yeah. Uh, a couple of them are going to take out their glass guns and

1421
01:13:44,680 --> 01:13:48,680
those can't hurt us cause it's glass. Yeah. And shoot them at you guys.

1422
01:13:48,680 --> 01:13:52,760
We got a crit. I hope we all die.

1423
01:13:52,760 --> 01:13:57,080
Okay. I don't actually hope that that was horrible to say. I'm sorry guys.

1424
01:13:57,080 --> 01:14:00,640
And those that's evil. That's negative to bring into the world.

1425
01:14:00,640 --> 01:14:03,240
still on the ground, so one of them really hits you.

1426
01:14:03,240 --> 01:14:06,940
He does

1427
01:14:06,940 --> 01:14:12,740
is ten damage to you, Patrick.

1428
01:14:12,740 --> 01:14:17,240
Sorry, fourteen damage. My bad for that and now it's my turn. Yes, it's your

1429
01:14:17,240 --> 01:14:19,540
turn. Okay. I'm still deaf and blind.

1430
01:14:19,540 --> 01:14:24,340
Okay, jump. So I would like to stumble off of the ship.

1431
01:14:24,340 --> 01:14:27,240
Look first into the crack.

1432
01:14:27,240 --> 01:14:29,140
Yeah, let's try it.

1433
01:14:29,140 --> 01:14:30,540
What do I need to do?

1434
01:14:30,540 --> 01:14:41,740
You're deaf and blind. Deaf and blind. I don't know what's going on, but I have really good

1435
01:14:41,740 --> 01:14:56,220
luck. Stroll D20. Alright. I'm rolling it. Fifteen. You stumble off the ship, you fall,

1436
01:14:56,220 --> 01:14:58,220
And it starts to shatter.

1437
01:14:58,220 --> 01:14:59,220
Okay.

1438
01:14:59,220 --> 01:15:01,220
Before I hit it?

1439
01:15:01,220 --> 01:15:03,220
No, as you land on with the hook.

1440
01:15:03,220 --> 01:15:04,220
Oh, that'd be fucked up.

1441
01:15:04,220 --> 01:15:06,060
That'd be so funny.

1442
01:15:06,060 --> 01:15:10,060
But it's like you landed in a place that it didn't have the most give, so it's kind of

1443
01:15:10,060 --> 01:15:14,580
like another piece of it is starting to crumble off.

1444
01:15:14,580 --> 01:15:15,580
Okay.

1445
01:15:15,580 --> 01:15:17,100
Watch out, it's sharp.

1446
01:15:17,100 --> 01:15:18,100
And you don't...

1447
01:15:18,100 --> 01:15:19,100
You can't hear me.

1448
01:15:19,100 --> 01:15:21,100
I'm just still smiling.

1449
01:15:21,100 --> 01:15:22,100
And you take...

1450
01:15:22,100 --> 01:15:26,100
well it's how much damage could it realistically be it's millions of

1451
01:15:26,100 --> 01:15:31,740
shards of razor-sharp glass yeah it's it's not an insignificant amount you take

1452
01:15:31,740 --> 01:15:37,180
13 damage that's insignificant to me that's basically zero yeah might as well

1453
01:15:37,180 --> 01:15:42,180
be but yeah I would say that like you're pretty close to shattering it at this

1454
01:15:42,180 --> 01:15:46,500
point you're trying to see siflex of sand sort of spray out of oh okay now

1455
01:15:46,500 --> 01:15:52,100
now. All right. That's your somebody else needs to I'm jumping down or first or

1456
01:15:52,100 --> 01:15:58,820
first. Okay, roll D 20. So the 20 is it just do an attack roll? Oh, well,

1457
01:15:58,820 --> 01:16:03,140
that's an eight plus whatever my attack rules, which I think is four. But let me

1458
01:16:03,140 --> 01:16:07,020
double check. I think that's fine. I mean, the Yeah, it's plus four. So that's

1459
01:16:07,020 --> 01:16:13,980
a 12. Okay. Yeah, you land with the or it doesn't it doesn't like do any damage to

1460
01:16:13,980 --> 01:16:16,460
ship but you do get it lodged into a crack.

1461
01:16:16,460 --> 01:16:19,020
Patrick, I'm going to be up to you brother.

1462
01:16:19,020 --> 01:16:21,980
I'm levering open the crack.

1463
01:16:21,980 --> 01:16:25,660
Roll a strength check.

1464
01:16:25,660 --> 01:16:28,860
Just like straight strength.

1465
01:16:28,860 --> 01:16:33,780
That is a 16.

1466
01:16:33,780 --> 01:16:38,460
You start to pull the ship apart.

1467
01:16:38,460 --> 01:16:44,020
you're pulling it the sand starts to like fly out like in front of your face and

1468
01:16:44,020 --> 01:16:48,020
it makes it easier because now it's like the glass is giving way turning into sand

1469
01:16:48,020 --> 01:16:51,820
which makes it easier and easier to pull apart. The sand is giving me like PTSD

1470
01:16:51,820 --> 01:17:02,820
flashbacks to dirt. You hear Dogen laughing at you. I'm pulling way harder. You see the captain of the

1471
01:17:02,820 --> 01:17:07,780
of the sand ship and he he says we'll meet again the sandwich will have a

1472
01:17:07,780 --> 01:17:12,020
revenge and he runs off the bow of the ship and dive into the water.

1473
01:17:12,020 --> 01:17:17,180
I hope we don't meet again good. And as the ship starts to like flay apart your

1474
01:17:17,180 --> 01:17:20,860
crew members are scrambling to get back on your ship. I'm still on the boat?

1475
01:17:20,860 --> 01:17:25,540
You're no you're not you're still on the regular boat you're blind. And deaf.

1476
01:17:25,540 --> 01:17:29,980
And deaf on the ship that is now sinking you're kind of in like a rage fury as

1477
01:17:29,980 --> 01:17:34,780
you're pulling the ship apart. Yeah. Are you gonna try to save your blind and

1478
01:17:34,780 --> 01:17:39,500
deaf friend? I'm on a boat.

1479
01:17:39,500 --> 01:17:51,420
Everybody look at me. So you're just gonna you're gonna sing um. I'm doing this. I'm raising the roof. What are you doing?

1480
01:17:51,420 --> 01:17:57,220
Me? I'm deaf and I'm blind so I'm pretty much having very vivid colorful

1481
01:17:57,220 --> 01:18:02,980
thoughts. Yeah, I'm putting I'm putting ropes down, but he can't see a single

1482
01:18:02,980 --> 01:18:08,380
one. I'm the right rope. So I've grabbed in ropes, plus ten ropes off the ship.

1483
01:18:08,380 --> 01:18:11,380
Okay, okay, you have to roll if you're going to try to actually I'm going to

1484
01:18:11,380 --> 01:18:15,380
try to rope around him. Yeah, save him. You're gonna need to roll

1485
01:18:15,380 --> 01:18:18,180
first a

1486
01:18:18,180 --> 01:18:23,380
actually just two athletics checks to athletics checks. Yeah, heard that.

1487
01:18:23,380 --> 01:18:25,860
Hey, heard that

1488
01:18:25,860 --> 01:18:31,180
Let's see, athletics number one is an 18.

1489
01:18:31,180 --> 01:18:32,180
Nice.

1490
01:18:32,180 --> 01:18:39,100
And then athletics number two is a six.

1491
01:18:39,100 --> 01:18:42,680
So you get over there with the rope, you tie it around him perfectly, you get a nice little

1492
01:18:42,680 --> 01:18:46,620
rope tug on your body, evil Stevel.

1493
01:18:46,620 --> 01:18:48,280
Then as you try to pull him--

1494
01:18:48,280 --> 01:18:50,340
Why does it have to be the order?

1495
01:18:50,340 --> 01:18:53,140
Is it, do I get a rope around him and I miss my own rope?

1496
01:18:53,140 --> 01:18:54,140
What?

1497
01:18:54,140 --> 01:18:55,500
Is that why I did two?

1498
01:18:55,500 --> 01:18:59,800
No, you're fine on your okay. You managed to pull a rope over while the ship is

1499
01:18:59,800 --> 01:19:04,400
sinking and turning I say deafen lines. I think the rope is a snake, so I

1500
01:19:04,400 --> 01:19:14,200
chopped with I bite I start biting at it. Okay, it doesn't have to go through,

1501
01:19:14,200 --> 01:19:18,800
but just I want to be I want to be fished out up. It's around your it's

1502
01:19:18,800 --> 01:19:23,200
around your neck. So the ship biting the road starts to fall. Oh, yeah, as the

1503
01:19:23,200 --> 01:19:28,000
sand starts to form and you guys now are just like wait wait wait wait so there's

1504
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:32,360
a bunch of sand going into the water and how big is gonna pollute the water how

1505
01:19:32,360 --> 01:19:36,280
big is this how big is the ship the ship it's like it was like about the same

1506
01:19:36,280 --> 01:19:40,800
size as your ship and our ship is a cruise ship so cruise ship of size

1507
01:19:40,800 --> 01:19:45,000
actual cruise ship it's all the Royal Caribbean okay well it's a boat size

1508
01:19:45,000 --> 01:19:51,840
amount of sand wouldn't there be a little bit of sand under our boat that he

1509
01:19:51,840 --> 01:19:56,720
could land on I'm already being pulled up on oh he's on a road fuck is going on

1510
01:19:56,720 --> 01:19:59,600
talking about what's gonna happen you think the sand would just stay on top of

1511
01:19:59,600 --> 01:20:07,040
the water created an island there I said it I mean he's wrong but he did say I

1512
01:20:07,040 --> 01:20:13,160
respect that you said I respect that you know mm-hmm that's really wrong moving

1513
01:20:13,160 --> 01:20:21,040
but anyway and I respect you I was so stupid but I do respect you that made no

1514
01:20:21,040 --> 01:20:25,240
sense this is the most fucking stupid thing you've ever said it's not what I

1515
01:20:25,240 --> 01:20:35,480
do respect and I love you and the boat falls and you two are gonna take me us

1516
01:20:35,480 --> 01:20:43,000
- sorry yes evil Steve'll and Dogen and Rod Dogen you are gonna take Rod Dogen

1517
01:20:43,000 --> 01:20:49,960
you Rod Dogen who you know okay you guys gonna take five damage oh that's

1518
01:20:49,960 --> 01:20:52,840
That's nothing.

1519
01:20:52,840 --> 01:20:59,120
And Patrick, you're going to have to try to pull them ashore, pull them onto the boat.

1520
01:20:59,120 --> 01:21:00,120
Can I do it with ease?

1521
01:21:00,120 --> 01:21:01,120
No.

1522
01:21:01,120 --> 01:21:02,120
No?

1523
01:21:02,120 --> 01:21:03,120
Really?

1524
01:21:03,120 --> 01:21:04,120
Roll a strength check.

1525
01:21:04,120 --> 01:21:05,120
Oh.

1526
01:21:05,120 --> 01:21:09,160
Okay, I just rolled and it says you do that with ease.

1527
01:21:09,160 --> 01:21:10,160
That's not true.

1528
01:21:10,160 --> 01:21:13,000
That's not how this game works.

1529
01:21:13,000 --> 01:21:15,360
Then you say what it says if you're so smart about what it says.

1530
01:21:15,360 --> 01:21:16,360
I can't see his phone.

1531
01:21:16,360 --> 01:21:17,360
I just don't want to say that.

1532
01:21:17,360 --> 01:21:18,600
Oh, and he can see his phone.

1533
01:21:18,600 --> 01:21:21,460
So maybe he has an idea about what it says.

1534
01:21:21,460 --> 01:21:23,320
He's pretending.

1535
01:21:23,320 --> 01:21:24,320
He never looks at his phone.

1536
01:21:24,320 --> 01:21:25,320
It's not working.

1537
01:21:25,320 --> 01:21:26,320
It's not working?

1538
01:21:26,320 --> 01:21:27,320
I got a 16.

1539
01:21:27,320 --> 01:21:28,320
Nice.

1540
01:21:28,320 --> 01:21:29,320
Okay.

1541
01:21:29,320 --> 01:21:32,060
Yeah, so you're able to pull them up.

1542
01:21:32,060 --> 01:21:33,720
You obviously are able to help.

1543
01:21:33,720 --> 01:21:34,720
With ease?

1544
01:21:34,720 --> 01:21:35,720
With ease.

1545
01:21:35,720 --> 01:21:36,720
Not with ease.

1546
01:21:36,720 --> 01:21:37,720
It's some struggle.

1547
01:21:37,720 --> 01:21:38,720
You have other crew members hop on and help you out.

1548
01:21:38,720 --> 01:21:39,720
Are they worth it ones in the game world?

1549
01:21:39,720 --> 01:21:40,720
I think we can say it was.

1550
01:21:40,720 --> 01:21:41,720
Yeah, and you guys are back on the boat.

1551
01:21:41,720 --> 01:21:42,720
I'm pulling them up.

1552
01:21:42,720 --> 01:21:48,200
I get them up and I'm like...

1553
01:21:48,200 --> 01:21:53,000
I did that with relative ease.

1554
01:21:53,000 --> 01:21:57,400
So you guys remember that the Sand Witch was the person that the...

1555
01:21:57,400 --> 01:21:58,400
Rubbers?

1556
01:21:58,400 --> 01:22:00,000
The rubbers were worshipping.

1557
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:03,480
So those seem to be associated with her.

1558
01:22:03,480 --> 01:22:04,480
Let's throw them overboard.

1559
01:22:04,480 --> 01:22:06,600
Yeah, wait, did they seem...

1560
01:22:06,600 --> 01:22:08,200
How did they interact with these sand...

1561
01:22:08,200 --> 01:22:10,400
These glass guys, they didn't...

1562
01:22:10,400 --> 01:22:11,400
They didn't care?

1563
01:22:11,400 --> 01:22:12,400
No, I mean, they don't have any...

1564
01:22:12,400 --> 01:22:13,400
No allegiance to them?

1565
01:22:13,400 --> 01:22:14,400
It doesn't seem like they have any access to like...

1566
01:22:14,400 --> 01:22:17,400
Okay, we don't throw them overboard then.

1567
01:22:17,400 --> 01:22:21,320
But yeah, I mean, at this point now, you're back on track,

1568
01:22:21,320 --> 01:22:26,320
sailing towards the, where were we sailing towards?

1569
01:22:26,320 --> 01:22:28,260
Sorry, it is real.

1570
01:22:28,260 --> 01:22:33,480
But before you do that, you see coming up on your right,

1571
01:22:33,480 --> 01:22:34,680
and we'll go to this next time.

1572
01:22:34,680 --> 01:22:35,980
- If this is another glass ship,

1573
01:22:35,980 --> 01:22:37,440
I'm gonna actually fucking kill you.

1574
01:22:37,440 --> 01:22:38,760
- No, no, no, no, no.

1575
01:22:38,760 --> 01:22:40,400
(laughing)

1576
01:22:40,400 --> 01:22:41,860
- No, it's ice this time.

1577
01:22:41,860 --> 01:22:43,880
- What you would recognize--

1578
01:22:43,880 --> 01:22:46,300
- But it doesn't melt, that's the crazy thing.

1579
01:22:46,300 --> 01:22:52,060
Patrick Jodar, you guys are dicks.

1580
01:22:52,060 --> 01:22:53,860
As Hot Babe Island.

1581
01:22:53,860 --> 01:22:56,180
Oh my god.

1582
01:22:56,180 --> 01:22:57,180
Oh wow.

1583
01:22:57,180 --> 01:22:58,180
Perfect.

1584
01:22:58,180 --> 01:23:03,900
That's, I come right out of deafness and blindness right as we see Hot Babe Island.

1585
01:23:03,900 --> 01:23:07,340
And I think I died when I fell off the roof.

1586
01:23:07,340 --> 01:23:11,140
The rope was you going to heaven.

1587
01:23:11,140 --> 01:23:14,140
Why is Dogan here?

1588
01:23:14,140 --> 01:23:16,140
[Laughter]

1589
01:23:16,140 --> 01:23:20,140
Okay, nice. Cool jam. Sounds perfect.

1590
01:23:20,140 --> 01:23:34,780
[Music]
