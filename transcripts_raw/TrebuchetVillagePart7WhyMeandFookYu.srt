[Music]

2
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:23,120
Last time on Trebuchet Village, the gang finally left the Whippet Woods and made their way

3
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:27,200
northeast towards Trebuchet Village.

4
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:32,200
They ran into some brave lions on the way who our heroes dispatched quickly, further making

5
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:35,920
themselves an enemy to this rebellious troop.

6
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:40,760
They settled in at the strange Penis Inn where they traded barbs with the bartender, stole

7
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:45,200
some drinks, and consorted with a moron named Timothy.

8
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:50,000
After agreeing to help Timothy's home town of Idiot Village where the townsfolk were

9
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:55,760
suffering from a variety of calamities, including a missing village idiot, the crew slept in

10
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:59,080
the inn and headed out the next morning.

11
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:05,480
Idiot Village was as destitute, plague ridden, and starving as Timothy had lamented.

12
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:10,080
While meeting with the mayor of Idiot Village to discuss how the gang would help, Patrick

13
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:14,520
Jodar insisted there was an election and that he was running against the mayor.

14
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:18,760
The mayor, about as smart as he looked, agreed that there was an election and rushed off to

15
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:20,560
prepare for a debate.

16
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:24,780
In the interim, Patrick snooped around the mayor's desk and found a resignation letter

17
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:28,620
signed by the village idiot, detailing how he was tired of being unappreciated for his

18
00:01:28,620 --> 00:01:33,260
efforts helping the morons of Idiot Village and was leaving for good.

19
00:01:33,260 --> 00:01:38,460
After an awesome debate, Patrick Jodard declared he was the mayor, made the former mayor, Ted,

20
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:39,980
into a sheriff.

21
00:01:39,980 --> 00:01:43,660
Dogen had a tense but helpful conversation with Dogen the Dirt God and the heroes decided

22
00:01:43,660 --> 00:01:46,820
to go to one of the caves the village idiot may be in.

23
00:01:46,820 --> 00:01:52,620
In this case it would be headed north.

24
00:01:52,620 --> 00:01:54,900
Who knows what may lie in wait?

25
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:55,900
I do.

26
00:01:55,900 --> 00:01:56,900
Um, so, I do.

27
00:01:56,900 --> 00:01:57,900
You.

28
00:01:57,900 --> 00:01:58,900
Wait, why'd you say it like that?

29
00:01:58,900 --> 00:01:59,900
What?

30
00:01:59,900 --> 00:02:00,900
Really?

31
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:05,420
Wait, do you know what's gonna happen in these before we...

32
00:02:05,420 --> 00:02:06,420
No, I only know...

33
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:07,860
I don't really know.

34
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:08,860
I know some of the...

35
00:02:08,860 --> 00:02:11,220
How about you tell us the whole story?

36
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:12,620
I know it could happen.

37
00:02:12,620 --> 00:02:14,420
Yeah, wait, if you know the story, just say it.

38
00:02:14,420 --> 00:02:17,900
We've been going through all this trouble, rolling all these dice.

39
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:18,900
No, no, no, no.

40
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:19,900
The play it and shit?

41
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:20,900
I'll...

42
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:21,900
I dress up for every episode.

43
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:22,900
I was exaggerating.

44
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:23,900
I want to do that.

45
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:25,260
First of all, I think you do want to do that.

46
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:26,260
I do want to do that.

47
00:02:26,260 --> 00:02:28,980
Second of all, I was exaggerating.

48
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:34,780
I only know, you know, the immediate things that can happen and some potential things

49
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:35,780
that can happen.

50
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:37,740
Okay, so what happens right now?

51
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:44,980
Right now, you guys are in Idiot Village and you're having a meal in whatever is left of

52
00:02:44,980 --> 00:02:50,520
their mess hall where Patrick Yodar, who is now the mayor of Idiot Village, is sitting

53
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:57,480
at the head of the table with his double serving of gruel and you're all sort of getting ready

54
00:02:57,480 --> 00:03:02,220
to leave on your journey north towards the cave.

55
00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:08,000
So the idiots are around you and you know sort of asking you to solve their problems

56
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,480
while you're trying to eat.

57
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:13,480
I'm solving them all easily.

58
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:15,360
What kind of problems you got?

59
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:19,440
Oh well I'm pretty sure I have two left feet.

60
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:21,980
Now I'm still figuring out my left from my right,

61
00:03:21,980 --> 00:03:25,140
but don't these two look too similar to not be like that?

62
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:26,460
Get those feet out.

63
00:03:26,460 --> 00:03:27,420
Let me see them.

64
00:03:27,420 --> 00:03:28,260
Those are two right feet.

65
00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:29,100
Okay, let's take a look.

66
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:29,920
Hold on. Those are two right feet

67
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:30,760
you got there.

68
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:35,760
I have to redo the Velcro and then undo it.

69
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:37,140
You gotta undo it.

70
00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:37,980
Just undo it.

71
00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:39,460
Oh, okay, I'm undoing it.

72
00:03:39,460 --> 00:03:41,460
All right, now put your feet on the table.

73
00:03:41,460 --> 00:03:44,060
He puts it on the table and they are two right feet.

74
00:03:44,060 --> 00:03:45,820
All right, now just sit like that.

75
00:03:45,820 --> 00:03:46,660
Okay.

76
00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:48,100
For quite a while.

77
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:48,940
You got it.

78
00:03:48,940 --> 00:03:50,940
Is this gonna, are they gonna just sort of slowly reverse?

79
00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:51,940
Can you shut up?

80
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:52,940
Just shut up.

81
00:03:52,940 --> 00:03:53,940
Yep.

82
00:03:53,940 --> 00:03:54,940
Alright.

83
00:03:54,940 --> 00:04:00,220
Well, we solved, we solved Stiebel's problem pretty quickly.

84
00:04:00,220 --> 00:04:02,420
Yeah, I'm gonna go to the bathroom.

85
00:04:02,420 --> 00:04:03,940
You mind if I take the gruel with me?

86
00:04:03,940 --> 00:04:04,940
Uh, no.

87
00:04:04,940 --> 00:04:07,780
What are you gonna do with the gruel in the bathroom?

88
00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:12,500
I'm gonna, I'm gonna come out, it's gonna be damn near full.

89
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:13,500
Alright.

90
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:14,500
Yeah.

91
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:34,500
the

92
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:41,500
the

93
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:50,180
fifth

94
00:04:50,180 --> 00:05:01,060
the

95
00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:03,060
You, not this kid!

96
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:05,060
No!

97
00:05:05,060 --> 00:05:06,060
No!

98
00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:10,060
Excuse me Mr. Mayor, could I have a little bit more?

99
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:12,060
I'm all British, everyone else is from the South.

100
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:15,060
Well this guy, this guy is telling me I can't give you any.

101
00:05:15,060 --> 00:05:16,060
No!

102
00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:18,060
No, you don't want this.

103
00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:19,060
Okay.

104
00:05:19,060 --> 00:05:21,060
Yeah, I'll just eat it myself.

105
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:22,060
Yeah.

106
00:05:22,060 --> 00:05:23,060
I just eat the whole bowl of...

107
00:05:23,060 --> 00:05:24,060
Yeah, roll it.

108
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:26,060
Why didn't you, you ate that in front, he was so hungry.

109
00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:28,060
Constitution, Constitution saving throw.

110
00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:29,060
Constitution saving throw.

111
00:05:29,060 --> 00:05:30,060
100%.

112
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:33,060
Okay, I'm scared.

113
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:34,060
Hold on.

114
00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:37,060
Actually, wait, sorry, not constitution saving throw.

115
00:05:37,060 --> 00:05:39,060
Do a wisdom saving throw.

116
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:40,060
I knew you were going to say wisdom.

117
00:05:40,060 --> 00:05:41,060
It's really a mental thing.

118
00:05:41,060 --> 00:05:42,060
15.

119
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:44,060
Yeah, you've done this before.

120
00:05:44,060 --> 00:05:47,060
It also just tastes the same as it did before I fucking did it.

121
00:05:47,060 --> 00:05:48,060
Yeah, right.

122
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:49,060
It doesn't have any really flavor.

123
00:05:49,060 --> 00:05:51,060
It doesn't change its flavor profile.

124
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:52,060
Tastes great.

125
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:53,060
Mm-hmm.

126
00:05:53,060 --> 00:05:58,740
"Oh, alright, well, I guess I'll go back to eatin'...

127
00:05:58,740 --> 00:05:59,740
sand!"

128
00:05:59,740 --> 00:06:02,740
And, uh, he sort of waddles off.

129
00:06:02,740 --> 00:06:03,740
Sand.

130
00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:10,020
You see the mayor, the former mayor, aka Ted, Sheriff Ted, come up to you guys and go, "Well,

131
00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:13,380
I hope you do a better job at mayor than I did.

132
00:06:13,380 --> 00:06:15,500
I mean, look at this place.

133
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:16,600
Everybody's all fucked up.

134
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:18,460
That guy's feet are out on the table.

135
00:06:18,460 --> 00:06:19,620
That's rude.

136
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:21,300
And that child's British.

137
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:26,580
So I think you could probably do a better job than me, but I hope I can also protect the

138
00:06:26,580 --> 00:06:32,640
town from things like, well, there's that nasty gang that comes around here always asking

139
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:34,260
us for money.

140
00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:38,280
But other than that, I don't really know what else I could protect us from.

141
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:40,980
I guess the village idiot used to handle that.

142
00:06:40,980 --> 00:06:44,300
I didn't really realize how little I appreciated him.

143
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:45,300
Hmm.

144
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:46,300
Hmm.

145
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:50,380
He's the stupidest sheriff I ever met.

146
00:06:50,380 --> 00:06:53,740
Yeah, he was saying that all that stuff facing away from us.

147
00:06:53,740 --> 00:06:57,900
That's 100% he's facing away from you and like undressing

148
00:06:57,900 --> 00:07:01,860
and like crawling into what he thinks is his bed and going to sleep.

149
00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:03,020
And then we can sleep.

150
00:07:03,020 --> 00:07:06,820
That's stupid and more just like in the nonsense it seems.

151
00:07:06,820 --> 00:07:14,540
He's kind of a yeah, he's a guy's a weird guy more than a kind of just random.

152
00:07:14,540 --> 00:07:16,860
I guess he's not the village idiot.

153
00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:17,860
He stands up.

154
00:07:17,860 --> 00:07:19,060
He's got no clothes on.

155
00:07:19,060 --> 00:07:24,300
He says yeah, frankly, I just ran out of like ideas for ways that people can be stupid

156
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:27,340
Everybody is just gonna be insane

157
00:07:27,340 --> 00:07:30,540
We'll fix this up. What's one plus one?

158
00:07:30,540 --> 00:07:33,980
Fish

159
00:07:33,980 --> 00:07:42,660
But I realized I just kind of fucked it all up

160
00:07:42,660 --> 00:07:47,320
Try like a different number try like

161
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:49,320
Okay, number 11.

162
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:50,320
Stupid.

163
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:51,320
Ah, see that?

164
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:54,160
That's, that's, man, it's still a little close, man.

165
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:57,080
I don't know if I'm gonna give you a pass here.

166
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:59,480
You're in the stupid town, you know what I'm saying?

167
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:01,160
Yeah, I feel you.

168
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:04,360
Yeah, I feel you, that's how you talk now?

169
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:07,720
Alright, just making sure.

170
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:14,880
So yeah, you guys wanna fucking leave here as soon as possible before I run out of characters?

171
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:16,880
No, let's solve more problems.

172
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:21,680
All right, I'm going to I'm going to pack another bag of gruel.

173
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:23,880
Yeah, yeah, sure.

174
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:25,880
Filling my backpack with gruel.

175
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:27,180
Yeah, and yeah, sure.

176
00:08:27,180 --> 00:08:28,880
You guys can definitely do that.

177
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:30,280
And then I'm going to leave.

178
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:30,980
Yeah, yeah.

179
00:08:30,980 --> 00:08:34,380
All of them are wave to you goodbye facing the other direction.

180
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:39,780
And you guys start to head on your journey north.

181
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:44,980
And yeah, the the planes that are above.

182
00:08:44,980 --> 00:08:53,520
Idiot village are like arid, awful, just shitty like grass,

183
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:58,360
like the worst fucking like dirt grass, just the least arable soil,

184
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:00,780
like nothing grows there.

185
00:09:00,780 --> 00:09:03,680
And I didn't know they had such good soil out here.

186
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:08,420
It's definitely an interesting dirt,

187
00:09:08,420 --> 00:09:15,540
probably a composite that you could sort of play around with and feel and and partake in if you

188
00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:22,500
wanted to do again because that's your character. Yeah, I'm I'm pretty right now. Yeah. Yeah. What

189
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:27,780
do you do with the dirt that you're that you're walking on? I'm swimming in it. Yeah, I'm like

190
00:09:27,780 --> 00:09:35,060
like breaststroke McDuck with I grab his legs and start like lawn mowing him with his mouth on the

191
00:09:35,060 --> 00:09:53,060
the

192
00:09:53,060 --> 00:09:58,100
again. No, I understand. That's about what I thought. Yeah,

193
00:09:58,100 --> 00:10:01,220
Sullivan who you're still married to technically. so you

194
00:10:01,220 --> 00:10:04,340
still get an AC buff. You guys have uh I believe that spell

195
00:10:04,340 --> 00:10:08,180
lasts a week and it's been 4 days. so I think you have I

196
00:10:08,180 --> 00:10:12,020
like that the uh this is a marriage permanent or is the

197
00:10:12,020 --> 00:10:15,620
marriage only West? What's the distinction? I think that I

198
00:10:15,620 --> 00:10:18,980
don't know. Well, marriage is I think marriage is forever. I

199
00:10:18,980 --> 00:10:24,580
I don't think the wedding ceremony, uh, like lasts like the buff from that.

200
00:10:24,580 --> 00:10:25,580
It's like a honeymoon.

201
00:10:25,580 --> 00:10:29,140
It's like a thing to prevent like players metagaming and just all marrying each other to get a

202
00:10:29,140 --> 00:10:30,140
free AC buff.

203
00:10:30,140 --> 00:10:34,700
Yeah, I think it's, yeah, I think, uh, yeah, let me see for the next seven days.

204
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:41,460
Yeah, yeah, you're, next seven days you get a plus two AC buff if you're in 30 feet of

205
00:10:41,460 --> 00:10:42,460
each other.

206
00:10:42,460 --> 00:10:45,300
That's a crazy thing to choose for, for the wedding effect.

207
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:47,180
Yeah, I don't really.

208
00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:50,280
Well, it's like you're making harder stronger with them.

209
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:52,880
Yeah, makes you harder to hit.

210
00:10:52,880 --> 00:11:02,280
Yeah, but yeah, so yeah, you guys can like, you know, you guys travel for a little bit North.

211
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:06,380
You can see the cave pretty clearly again, because it's like kind of flat.

212
00:11:06,380 --> 00:11:08,380
It's pretty flat.

213
00:11:08,380 --> 00:11:09,480
It's a plane, right?

214
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:16,980
And as you start to travel and it starts to approach from, you know, it was probably mid-morning when you guys left and now it's kind of closer

215
00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:17,980
to the afternoon.

216
00:11:17,980 --> 00:11:25,080
You see a wandering merchant come by and he's a a cobalt

217
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:25,780
merchant.

218
00:11:25,780 --> 00:11:29,680
So a little like a drill dragon guy with and he has no teeth

219
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:34,780
and as he comes to see you all and he has it looks like behind

220
00:11:34,780 --> 00:11:40,780
him a tall humanoid human pleasure man.

221
00:11:40,780 --> 00:11:45,480
So one of the pleasure men from the first episode and you see

222
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:51,560
him and he goes, he goes, oh, well, it's nice to see fellow

223
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:53,480
travelers on the plane.

224
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:57,680
My name's Larry, the plane walker.

225
00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:01,520
You guys interested in my wares?

226
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:03,760
What happened to your teeth?

227
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:05,660
You put your teeth in.

228
00:12:05,660 --> 00:12:09,840
I think a child using them as a binder clip right now.

229
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:13,000
I don't know where they could be.

230
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:16,320
We just said a binder.

231
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:21,880
Well, I mean, I just I just don't know where I belong in that stupid city back there.

232
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:24,080
Oh, idiot, Valash.

233
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:25,600

Oh, sure. And he's I'll send you this link.

236
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:37,080
And he sends you a link to a shop.

237
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:40,080
And it's Larry the Plainwalker Shop.

238
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:41,680
Oh, my God.

239
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:44,220
So he has moving into the next century.

240
00:12:44,220 --> 00:12:46,280
There's money in D&D.

241
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:48,380
Yeah, you have some of it.

242
00:12:48,380 --> 00:12:49,880
Holy shit.

243
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:50,620
Yeah.

244
00:12:50,620 --> 00:12:52,920
So there's some he has some really cool stuff.

245
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:55,080
He's sort of a weird kind of guy.

246
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:57,880
So you guys can sort of browse and peruse his wares.

247
00:12:57,880 --> 00:13:01,020
He's got you guys been keeping track of how much gold you've been getting?

248
00:13:01,020 --> 00:13:02,780
I think so.

249
00:13:02,780 --> 00:13:06,120
This says that I have 10 SP gold.

250
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:08,720
I think I have a bunch of gold.

251
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:11,020
Yeah, you have a lot of gold, Patrick.

252
00:13:11,020 --> 00:13:15,100
Yoda are I don't I have I think you have 175 last I checked on

253
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:17,420
your sheet. If you go to your inventory, click inventory,

254
00:13:17,420 --> 00:13:20,700
you'll see it in DND beyond. I don't know if you two I think

255
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:24,220
I have check your gold pieces. Yeah. I think I think Patrick

256
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:28,140
has just more or less been like holding any gold you've gotten

257
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:30,140
part of it is because you guys haven't really done a quest

258
00:13:30,140 --> 00:13:33,580
where you got gold at the end of it and then Patrick has been

259
00:13:33,580 --> 00:13:38,460
stealing from places a lot, which has been I guess helpful.

260
00:13:38,460 --> 00:13:39,560
How much do you have, Patrick?

261
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:41,760
How much do you have?

262
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:43,160
175.

263
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:50,660
Okay, and yeah, while you guys are browsing the wares, the

264
00:13:50,660 --> 00:13:56,360
pleasure man goes over to you evil Stiebel and he sort of

265
00:13:56,360 --> 00:14:01,360
like whispers to you like like he goes, we heard what you

266
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:05,860
did at Mount Honest do amazing work.

267
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:08,860
The discharge will be pleased with what you've done.

268
00:14:08,860 --> 00:14:11,040
You're welcome.

269
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:13,640
Roll a deception.

270
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:17,380
Fuck, I'm going to get in trouble with this guy.

271
00:14:17,380 --> 00:14:19,380
Five.

272
00:14:19,380 --> 00:14:23,480
He sort of looks at you skeptically.

273
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:24,720
He says, Do I?

274
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:27,280
Yeah, I actually say, You're welcome.

275
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:33,260
Do you do I have the right?

276
00:14:33,260 --> 00:14:35,200
Are you not evil, Stievel?

277
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:37,640
Did you not go into the volcano?

278
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:41,140
Yeah, you got the wrong guy.

279
00:14:41,140 --> 00:14:43,060
Oh, I see.

280
00:14:43,060 --> 00:14:44,560
Well, uh huh.

281
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:45,360
Hmm.

282
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:49,860
OK, well, sorry you roll roll deception again with disadvantage.

283
00:14:49,860 --> 00:14:52,340
No. OK, nine. Yeah.

284
00:14:52,340 --> 00:14:53,360
He's like, hmm.

285
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:55,840
He's just sort of skeptical from what you can tell.

286
00:14:55,840 --> 00:15:01,440
He's like, well, either way, I will let discharge

287
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:05,440
know that we saw what appeared to be an evil Stievel.

288
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:13,440
No, evil Stievel is my twin brother and it's his birthday.

289
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:17,440
Let's sing happy birthday for him right now.

290
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:20,440
Yeah, let's all get in a circle.

291
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:21,440
Happy birthday.

292
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:24,440
Evil Stievel, my twin brother.

293
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:29,440
Look, if you don't want to be associated with the Legend Men,

294
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:31,540
and I understand.

295
00:15:31,540 --> 00:15:32,600
Look at me.

296
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:34,740
He looks awful.

297
00:15:34,740 --> 00:15:36,480
I get it.

298
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:40,800
But just I will.

299
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:42,800
It's OK.

300
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:43,380
Don't worry.

301
00:15:43,380 --> 00:15:46,900
He sort of like kind of pedantically taps you, pats you on the shoulder.

302
00:15:46,900 --> 00:15:48,700
All right. Bye.

303
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:50,640

I'd like to make a deal for it to where I can get the staff of swarming insects for 15 gold pieces. Oh

325
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:36,840
That is a just a far too steep a discount

326
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:39,120
It's a

327
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:41,120
1500 gold piece item

328
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:42,320
What is it?

329
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:46,520
swarming. Yeah, fifteen. He's talking you down to 1%. Cam,

330
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:52,120
what is the staff of swarming insects? Staff rare. Mm hmm.

331
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:56,120
You can click. You can click. You can click. It has ten

332
00:17:56,120 --> 00:18:02,440
charges. It can you can cast giant insect or insect plague or

333
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:06,280
you can make a cloud of insects. Yeah, it's uh insanely

334
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:13,560
good staff. basically just like mastery over most insect magics

335
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:19,160
that you would wanna use in DND and it is expensive. Oh, but I

336
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:23,400
can't use it if it says requires attunement by a bard

337
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:26,200
cleric druid sorcerer warlock or wizard. That means I can't

338
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:30,280
use it. Yeah. So yeah, you can't can't attune to it. Hey,

339
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:34,760
evil Steve. Uh huh. You should steal the staff and then use it

340
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:35,760
to kill these guys.

341
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:36,760
All right.

342
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:37,760
Well, hold on, hold on.

343
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:38,760
Why?

344
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:39,760
Why?

345
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:40,760
Why did you steal it?

346
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:41,760
I'm the.

347
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:42,760
Yeah, but you can't use it.

348
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:49,760
I have a feeling that this will be a particularly hard item to steal.

349
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:50,760
Why?

350
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:56,240
It's it's the same as any it's because it's the only item with a link for that.

351
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:58,240
We're gonna we're gonna steal anything.

352
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:01,680
We might as well steal the one that costs the most.

353
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:05,520
you want to steal something that's smaller instead that doesn't make any sense.

354
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:14,640
I do travel the planes from time to time so if you ever wanted to come back when you have

355
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:15,640
more money I...

356
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:20,240
I don't know if we'd be able to find you though I feel like we wouldn't be able to so you

357
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:22,200
know it's kind of a one and done thing here.

358
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:24,320
Oh well I see.

359
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:27,840
I kind of blend in with all the other idiots around here.

360
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:29,840
Oh

361
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:36,800
Okay, I'm not bad babe. No. No, I'm not like that town those people who ever since why me left

362
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:39,000
They got really fucked up

363
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,320
Whoo. Yeah, why me?

364
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:43,840
Yeah, why me? Yeah

365
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:50,200
He's always going why me why me as me if I gotta talk to you another goddamn second get out of my way

366
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:55,120
Oh, I mean, you know, that's doing a little guys crazy. Look at this guy. He likes this

367
00:19:55,120 --> 00:20:01,080
He likes getting he likes getting called this stuff you like in you like getting roast like this you get off on stuff like this

368
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:02,480
I get that

369
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:08,740
All right. Yeah, you you funky ass look at you badass. What are you a merchant?

370
00:20:08,740 --> 00:20:10,740
I look like she won't even stealth

371
00:20:10,740 --> 00:20:13,680
That's very good

372
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:19,400
But let's see how the pleasure man guard does. Oh, this is gonna be bad

373
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:23,080
This is a bad idea. Okay

374
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:30,420
Okay, he the pleasure men guard is not able to catch you where you're going

375
00:20:30,420 --> 00:20:36,160
And not able to sort of sense that like you're kind of sidling up to where his wares are now

376
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:43,200
The real trick is of course the slight of handshake 15. Yeah, steal a whole ass staff from an old man

377
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:50,920
That's not gonna cut it. So here's what happened. I play this up. I want you to try for sure for your sake

378
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:53,780
Yeah, so he's so - oh, hey

379
00:20:53,780 --> 00:20:57,700
Hey, hey, whoa, you're not calling me fat or gay or something.

380
00:20:57,700 --> 00:20:58,700
He's trying to tickle you.

381
00:20:58,700 --> 00:21:01,260
I didn't say either of those.

382
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:04,700
I'm doing a different kind, I'm doing a physical roast.

383
00:21:04,700 --> 00:21:10,740
Yeah, point at his big nose and no teeth.

384
00:21:10,740 --> 00:21:15,340
I'm going to point at your thing and I'm going to call it small.

385
00:21:15,340 --> 00:21:20,260
Physical roast is just like beating someone up.

386
00:21:20,260 --> 00:21:23,260
Okay, yeah, roll deception, I guess.

387
00:21:23,260 --> 00:21:26,260
13.

388
00:21:26,260 --> 00:21:28,260
Okay, let's give his insight.

389
00:21:28,260 --> 00:21:30,260
He's, he's, he's shrewd.

390
00:21:30,260 --> 00:21:32,260
Physical roast is so genius.

391
00:21:32,260 --> 00:21:34,260
How's that not with advantage?

392
00:21:34,260 --> 00:21:36,260
Yeah, yeah, come on now.

393
00:21:36,260 --> 00:21:38,260
It's funny.

394
00:21:38,260 --> 00:21:40,260
It's not genius, though.

395
00:21:40,260 --> 00:21:42,260
It's genius, dude. It's genius. That's by the book.

396
00:21:42,260 --> 00:21:44,260
Yeah, no, you know what? He didn't really,

397
00:21:44,260 --> 00:21:46,260
he sort of, he started game for that.

398
00:21:46,260 --> 00:21:48,260
He's like, "Oh, okay, what you doing?

399
00:21:48,260 --> 00:21:49,260
What you doing?

400
00:21:49,260 --> 00:21:50,260
Where you poke?

401
00:21:50,260 --> 00:21:51,260
Boy, did you get a point?

402
00:21:51,260 --> 00:21:52,260
Pinch his cheeks like a fat baby.

403
00:21:52,260 --> 00:21:53,260
I'm gonna point at your thing.

404
00:21:53,260 --> 00:21:54,260
Go.

405
00:21:54,260 --> 00:21:55,260
You're gonna point at my thing?

406
00:21:55,260 --> 00:21:56,260
Yeah.

407
00:21:56,260 --> 00:21:57,260
Pinch his butt.

408
00:21:57,260 --> 00:21:58,260
Pinch his bottom.

409
00:21:58,260 --> 00:21:59,260
And it's small, too.

410
00:21:59,260 --> 00:22:00,260
And see this?

411
00:22:00,260 --> 00:22:03,940
I'm making it look like it's smaller by pointing at it.

412
00:22:03,940 --> 00:22:04,940
No!

413
00:22:04,940 --> 00:22:05,940
Ah!

414
00:22:05,940 --> 00:22:08,980
Play his thingy like the world's smallest violin.

415
00:22:08,980 --> 00:22:10,940
Yeah, I'm gonna try to do that.

416
00:22:10,940 --> 00:22:15,500
Oh, well, you know, you don't have to touch my- Oh, hell, just touch my penis.

417
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:17,340
No, I'm not- Well, I'm not gonna- Holy crap.

418
00:22:17,340 --> 00:22:18,340
I'm not gonna touch it.

419
00:22:18,340 --> 00:22:19,340
Oh, okay.

420
00:22:19,340 --> 00:22:20,340
Oh my god.

421
00:22:20,340 --> 00:22:21,340
Whoa.

422
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:22,340
That's weird.

423
00:22:22,340 --> 00:22:23,340
I thought you were bringing it there.

424
00:22:23,340 --> 00:22:26,260
You know what, you better give us an item on the house for that one.

425
00:22:26,260 --> 00:22:27,580
That was weird as hell.

426
00:22:27,580 --> 00:22:29,500
I was trying, I thought we were joking around.

427
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:32,180
You took it way too far.

428
00:22:32,180 --> 00:22:34,020
Yeah, you made it weird.

429
00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:36,700
I made it weird?

430
00:22:36,700 --> 00:22:37,700
I made it weird?

431
00:22:37,700 --> 00:22:39,700
Yeah, you made it weird.

432
00:22:39,700 --> 00:22:40,700
Alright.

433
00:22:40,700 --> 00:22:44,580
So you better give us an item.

434
00:22:44,580 --> 00:22:49,640
I thought we were fooling around from a British boarding school where they do things like that. So

435
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:53,220
Like not not in like that way. Uh

436
00:22:53,220 --> 00:22:55,540
so

437
00:22:55,540 --> 00:22:57,300
item

438
00:22:57,300 --> 00:23:03,280
Here he had you guys a potion of healing. That's right. That'll do for now

439
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:06,740
the off-color humor and

440
00:23:06,740 --> 00:23:11,620
Hey, man, it's okay not yeah

441
00:23:13,060 --> 00:23:16,420
Truck on out of here you penis freak. Yeah, you got it

442
00:23:16,420 --> 00:23:20,060
Sayonara, he really likes that

443
00:23:20,060 --> 00:23:26,320
He's really he's really weird. He's really messed up in the head. I'm glad he's gone

444
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:31,660
It is one of the weirdest guys I've ever seen we've met a lot of weird guys. I think he was maybe the weirdest

445
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:36,060
Yeah, I uh, yeah shit. I didn't even say anything

446
00:23:36,060 --> 00:23:38,740
Yeah

447
00:23:38,740 --> 00:23:46,740
Clown I there was like a heat emanating off of his penis. We already killed the clown Steve. Oh, that was the last quest

448
00:23:46,740 --> 00:23:50,300
Oh, I mean, let's find the stupid. What is he a dumb?

449
00:23:50,300 --> 00:23:52,940
Idiot. Yeah, let's kill this clown

450
00:23:52,940 --> 00:23:55,180
Yeah

451
00:23:55,180 --> 00:24:00,020
Okay. Yeah, you guys keep wandering and sort of evening approaches

452
00:24:00,020 --> 00:24:02,820
as you wander through the plains and

453
00:24:02,820 --> 00:24:06,980
You start to come across the cave and

454
00:24:07,860 --> 00:24:13,740
and the northern cave. It's a big fucking cave. It's a big mouth of the cave. It's a sort

455
00:24:13,740 --> 00:24:19,200
of a darkish, bluish, grayish rock kind of sticks out in the rock face compared to a lot

456
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:25,360
of the other sort of the more brownish, you know, more arid looking sort of a geological

457
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:32,740
outcroppings here. And as you guys wander in, you don't, it's a pretty, it's a, it seems

458
00:24:32,740 --> 00:24:36,660
like a mostly a pretty shallow cave. It looks like a small Creek sort of running through

459
00:24:36,660 --> 00:24:41,580
it like not even like a real substantial like not like a stream, but like a stream of like

460
00:24:41,580 --> 00:24:46,900
a creek of little tiny thin line of water and you don't really see anybody inside.

461
00:24:46,900 --> 00:24:53,220
Remember there were there were two caves obviously and you don't seem to see anyone inside though

462
00:24:53,220 --> 00:24:54,220
right now.

463
00:24:54,220 --> 00:24:55,220
Hello.

464
00:24:55,220 --> 00:25:00,340
Oh, echo, echo, echo, echo.

465
00:25:00,340 --> 00:25:01,340
Can be put in after.

466
00:25:01,340 --> 00:25:02,340
Echo, echo.

467
00:25:02,340 --> 00:25:06,140
No, that's what I'm saying.

468
00:25:06,140 --> 00:25:17,020
the

469
00:25:17,020 --> 00:25:35,100
the

470
00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:40,540
the other guy. Well, yes, I'm ostensibly the village idiot.

471
00:25:40,540 --> 00:25:44,540
My name is why me? Why me?

472
00:25:44,540 --> 00:25:46,380
Ah, that's this guy.

473
00:25:46,380 --> 00:25:48,020
Well, I got it from earlier.

474
00:25:48,020 --> 00:25:50,260
It's not saying your name over and over again.

475
00:25:50,260 --> 00:25:52,140
It's annoying. You're not a Pokemon.

476
00:25:52,140 --> 00:25:56,420
Yeah. Even evil, evil, evil, evil.

477
00:25:56,420 --> 00:25:59,020
So annoying. That is Petruch Petruch Yarder.

478
00:25:59,020 --> 00:26:01,500
Hi, I'm a way.

479
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:03,540
I had my hand out and I try to shake his hand.

480
00:26:03,540 --> 00:26:08,540
Yeah, he extends out a frail, wizardly hand and he shakes it.

481
00:26:08,540 --> 00:26:10,980
He says, "Oh, wait, hold on.

482
00:26:10,980 --> 00:26:11,980
And I need to..."

483
00:26:11,980 --> 00:26:13,620
"Can I have your head?"

484
00:26:13,620 --> 00:26:16,220
"I need to test one more thing, maybe."

485
00:26:16,220 --> 00:26:18,580
And he makes everything...

486
00:26:18,580 --> 00:26:26,620
He basically waves his hands around and everything around you goes dark in a way that is magical.

487
00:26:26,620 --> 00:26:29,780
Some sort of magical darkness.

488
00:26:29,780 --> 00:26:32,340
And he says, "Peek-a-boo."

489
00:26:32,340 --> 00:26:33,340
Ah!

490
00:26:33,340 --> 00:26:36,900
Yeah, you're still there.

491
00:26:36,900 --> 00:26:37,900
I don't--

492
00:26:37,900 --> 00:26:38,900
Oh, okay, good.

493
00:26:38,900 --> 00:26:41,300
Just double-checking you're not from that town.

494
00:26:41,300 --> 00:26:42,300
Okay.

495
00:26:42,300 --> 00:26:43,980
'Cause they forget right away.

496
00:26:43,980 --> 00:26:44,980
They just go home.

497
00:26:44,980 --> 00:26:45,980
We are from that town.

498
00:26:45,980 --> 00:26:46,980
Oh, fuck!

499
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:47,980
Okay.

500
00:26:47,980 --> 00:26:48,980
He's the mayor.

501
00:26:48,980 --> 00:26:49,980
He's the mayor.

502
00:26:49,980 --> 00:26:50,980
What?

503
00:26:50,980 --> 00:26:51,980
Oh, yeah.

504
00:26:51,980 --> 00:26:52,980
No!

505
00:26:52,980 --> 00:26:53,980
I don't want any part of this town anymore!

506
00:26:53,980 --> 00:26:54,980
I'm done with you fools!

507
00:26:54,980 --> 00:26:55,980
I'm done helping you!

508
00:26:55,980 --> 00:26:56,980
Well, how about--

509
00:26:56,980 --> 00:26:59,620
Well, how about you listen to us first, you asshole?

510
00:26:59,620 --> 00:27:03,760
Ooh, this one's got a mouth on him. They elected a mayor with yeah

511
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:07,700
Head. Well, I've got I got I got power now

512
00:27:07,700 --> 00:27:12,780
He'll physically roast you man. You want him you better watch out

513
00:27:12,780 --> 00:27:20,700
This guy's wiener on the way here. Yeah, that's right. That guy's a fucking freak. I got so much power now. I don't even know

514
00:27:20,700 --> 00:27:28,140
Also, okay. We're not I guess we're not from the town. Okay, like rain yourselves quick

515
00:27:28,140 --> 00:27:35,420
Yes we are. I'm from a, I'm probably from a bush, but there are, we, we, that is the

516
00:27:35,420 --> 00:27:42,380
last location we were at. I'm just, uh, I'm from around.

517
00:27:42,380 --> 00:27:51,060
Okay. Dirt, dirt guy. How do you know? You're covered in dirt. You got the mark of

518
00:27:51,060 --> 00:27:57,460
Dogan you look like him. Yeah. Yeah, I came from a dirt farm if I remember correctly

519
00:27:57,460 --> 00:28:01,460
Hmm yes you

520
00:28:01,460 --> 00:28:03,060
Hey, do you?

521
00:28:03,060 --> 00:28:04,980
Do you chew dirt?

522
00:28:04,980 --> 00:28:06,980
You look like you're a paladin, right?

523
00:28:06,980 --> 00:28:08,700
No

524
00:28:08,700 --> 00:28:14,180
And dirt is falling out of the corners of my mouth. You know, you don't have to chew dirt to talk to him, right?

525
00:28:14,180 --> 00:28:15,340
he just

526
00:28:15,340 --> 00:28:16,500
he

527
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:23,060
He's an asshole. He thinks you he makes you think you have to chew dirt. You really don't I don't have to chew dirt

528
00:28:23,060 --> 00:28:25,820
Not to talk to him. No, you could just ask for him

529
00:28:25,820 --> 00:28:31,040
I don't know why he tells all his disciples that they have to chew dirt. I think I funny he does

530
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:33,840
Yeah, I think it's a good bit, but it's pretty rude

531
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:35,660
it

532
00:28:35,660 --> 00:28:37,220
but

533
00:28:37,220 --> 00:28:41,640
Anyway, so what do you guys? What do you guys want to say? I think he likes it

534
00:28:41,980 --> 00:28:49,380
So basically this idiot or this normal guy is the idiot mayor of stupid town and

535
00:28:49,380 --> 00:28:55,260
He needs the dumbass which is you right come back and fix

536
00:28:55,260 --> 00:28:58,300
the town

537
00:28:58,300 --> 00:29:06,000
Yeah, pretty much that do you know how much I've done for that town? Anyway, no, we just got here

538
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:09,980
He waves his hand and

539
00:29:11,140 --> 00:29:17,620
Like chair appears beneath him and three cushions appear and he sort of motions if you'd like to slide we don't get chairs

540
00:29:17,620 --> 00:29:21,180
No, it's my fucking cave. I get the chair

541
00:29:21,180 --> 00:29:29,040
All right, I said in the chair before he does oh yeah, you're gonna roll for that. Yeah, I am

542
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:33,660
Can I see your head real quick roll suck my dick? I'm sitting in this

543
00:29:38,540 --> 00:29:41,040
No, you could sit in the chair. It's fine. That was fun

544
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:43,960
Wait, what'd you get? That's 12

545
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:52,420
On what on dexterity? That's fair. That's probably what I was gonna make it do. Yeah, I'm like pretty much right by the chair, but I summoned

546
00:29:52,420 --> 00:29:55,540
So you just look like an asshole

547
00:29:55,540 --> 00:29:59,020
What's up Patrick, that's your name

548
00:29:59,020 --> 00:30:01,780
Can I put on your head?

549
00:30:01,780 --> 00:30:03,780
Yeah, she could put on my hat. All right

550
00:30:04,180 --> 00:30:09,220
Well, what about the rest of your clothes? No, I need to keep the robot

551
00:30:09,220 --> 00:30:14,340
Could I put those clothes on I have a spare robe if you'd like to wear one

552
00:30:14,340 --> 00:30:17,700
Open let him wear that

553
00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:24,540
Rob, I could go for the host here. You're supposed to show hospitality. You want me to go change out of this room?

554
00:30:24,540 --> 00:30:27,260
Yeah, so get stand up from the chair and just go get the spare

555
00:30:27,260 --> 00:30:32,820
You know what? You've bested me this time. He's actually doing it. He's

556
00:30:32,820 --> 00:30:33,820
He's so stupid.

557
00:30:33,820 --> 00:30:34,820
Oh my god, what a...

558
00:30:34,820 --> 00:30:35,820
I don't even want those clothes.

559
00:30:35,820 --> 00:30:37,900
He really is a village idiot.

560
00:30:37,900 --> 00:30:40,020
He gets up and he walks towards the back of the cave.

561
00:30:40,020 --> 00:30:41,020
You hear him like...

562
00:30:41,020 --> 00:30:42,020
I sit on the chair.

563
00:30:42,020 --> 00:30:43,020
Yeah, so it's between robes.

564
00:30:43,020 --> 00:30:44,420
He comes back and sees you're in the chair.

565
00:30:44,420 --> 00:30:46,580
He's like, "Damn it, dude!

566
00:30:46,580 --> 00:30:47,580
You got my ass!"

567
00:30:47,580 --> 00:30:49,300
And then they call fives.

568
00:30:49,300 --> 00:30:52,220
Yeah, and he gives you a robe, Steve-o.

569
00:30:52,220 --> 00:30:54,140
He gives you one, Patrick.

570
00:30:54,140 --> 00:30:56,420
And Doga just goes, "Did you want one?"

571
00:30:56,420 --> 00:30:58,420
"Duh, go back and get another one."

572
00:30:58,420 --> 00:31:00,700
"You're in the chair!"

573
00:31:00,700 --> 00:31:08,700
All right, I'll go back. What about the frog and and the you he's fine. You brought a child here, too

574
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:11,460
Okay

575
00:31:11,460 --> 00:31:21,420
Hi, sorry, we don't know that kid and don't know his name or whose son he is, but he's just gonna hang out

576
00:31:26,620 --> 00:31:30,180
and he goes back and he grabs a robe and he comes back and he gives you a robe and

577
00:31:30,180 --> 00:31:35,580
He summons a a bigger chair and sits in it and looks at you don't

578
00:31:35,580 --> 00:31:40,620
Like I use thaumaturgy to cause tremors in the ground and knock over his chair. Oh

579
00:31:40,620 --> 00:31:43,180
fuck

580
00:31:43,180 --> 00:31:45,380
All right, pretty good I'll stand

581
00:31:45,380 --> 00:31:50,060
Look, I've done a lot for that town. Here we go

582
00:31:50,060 --> 00:31:54,380
Do you know what it's like to be a wizard without a tower?

583
00:31:55,260 --> 00:32:01,320
All wizards are supposed to have towers, but why me? No, I don't get a tower

584
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:06,360
I have a fucking cave you seen this place. Do you know where that Creek leads?

585
00:32:06,360 --> 00:32:08,660
Nowhere good

586
00:32:08,660 --> 00:32:12,300
It sucks. There's just a bunch of bats fucking

587
00:32:12,300 --> 00:32:16,820
You know what this ooze is. It's bat ooze. It sucks

588
00:32:16,820 --> 00:32:21,960
This is my cave. This is my home and one day I got tired of it

589
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:26,360
And so I wandered around and I found this town where everyone was dying of the plague

590
00:32:26,360 --> 00:32:33,440
And I figured out that they were just sort of poisoning themselves by accident eating their own shit thinking

591
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:37,140
Well, it came out that end. So why not this end -

592
00:32:37,140 --> 00:32:43,760
Well, you know I helped them with that and they decided I was stupid because I wear

593
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:46,400
what they called a

594
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:53,920
Blanket for your body, which I guess is what they think a robe is so and a hat that reaches the stars and

595
00:32:53,920 --> 00:32:59,080
Kind of like what I'm wearing right now. Yeah, it sounds similar to what we have going on

596
00:32:59,080 --> 00:33:04,520
Yeah, just make it up a story about Patrick's hat right now. Oh, I knew it looked good

597
00:33:04,520 --> 00:33:12,240
He says uh, well anyway, so that town is is fucked

598
00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:15,400
Okay, I I tried to integrate there

599
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:20,240
I thought I was gonna maybe find some people who I could even like but of course

600
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:23,720
Why me? Oh, why me?

601
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:27,560
No one likes why me dug in the dirt cobbler?

602
00:33:27,560 --> 00:33:30,240
You know Steve

603
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:32,840
Hey guys, do you want to

604
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:38,880
You should I think your biggest problem is you need a better wizard name. Yeah, and I think

605
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:41,560
Not good. I think maybe

606
00:33:41,560 --> 00:33:42,560
That's a good one.

607
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:43,700
What?

608
00:33:43,700 --> 00:33:45,200
Maybe.

609
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:46,240
Maybe.

610
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:47,240
Maybe.

611
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:50,140
Or like, what about like, I'm cool.

612
00:33:50,140 --> 00:33:52,340
Yeah. What about like, fuck you?

613
00:33:52,340 --> 00:33:54,140
Oh, fuck you.

614
00:33:54,140 --> 00:33:55,140
Fuck you isn't good.

615
00:33:55,140 --> 00:33:56,300
That would be good.

616
00:33:56,300 --> 00:33:57,040
How does that sound?

617
00:33:57,040 --> 00:33:57,740
Yeah, say it.

618
00:33:57,740 --> 00:33:58,740
Fuck you.

619
00:33:58,740 --> 00:33:59,980
Fuck you.

620
00:33:59,980 --> 00:34:00,540
Yeah.

621
00:34:00,540 --> 00:34:01,040
Yeah.

622
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:01,540
That's pretty good.

623
00:34:01,540 --> 00:34:02,040
You know what?

624
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:05,480
You know what your problem is, is you let those people walk all over you after you help them.

625
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:06,680
That's right. You need to help them.

626
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:08,120
You need to stand up for yourself.

627
00:34:08,120 --> 00:34:09,560
You needed you needed.

628
00:34:09,560 --> 00:34:10,060
Yeah.

629
00:34:10,060 --> 00:34:10,560
You know.

630
00:34:11,020 --> 00:34:13,020
You know what? How did you become mayor?

631
00:34:13,020 --> 00:34:14,240
Me?

632
00:34:14,240 --> 00:34:14,960
Yeah.

633
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:16,620
I told them I was the mayor.

634
00:34:16,620 --> 00:34:17,900
Holy shit.

635
00:34:17,900 --> 00:34:19,580
Yeah, it's that simple.

636
00:34:19,580 --> 00:34:23,500
You know, I never thought maybe that could just be my fucking town.

637
00:34:23,500 --> 00:34:26,540
Yeah, what if I just bring you back there and I tell them

638
00:34:26,540 --> 00:34:29,500
that I gave that you're me

639
00:34:29,500 --> 00:34:31,100
and

640
00:34:31,100 --> 00:34:31,600
What?

641
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:32,220
I'm the mayor.

642
00:34:32,220 --> 00:34:38,940
Oh, so fuck me wait, hold on Patrick. You should change your name to fuck me and then you could be fuck you

643
00:34:39,900 --> 00:34:46,700
me. Could we wear backpacks or something? I mean I guess you could yeah. That'd be pretty nice.

644
00:34:46,700 --> 00:34:53,340
You already have matching outfits on. This is really unfolding. See now that uh now that we

645
00:34:53,340 --> 00:34:57,420
got the matching outfits on it's uh not like they're gonna be able to tell that you're not me.

646
00:34:57,420 --> 00:35:03,660
Is there another do you want to try out another voice? I think we're good with the voices. I think

647
00:35:06,460 --> 00:35:08,460
I think that'll be alright.

648
00:35:08,460 --> 00:35:10,460
I think there's another voice we could try out.

649
00:35:10,460 --> 00:35:12,460
Okay.

650
00:35:12,460 --> 00:35:14,460
Whatever.

651
00:35:14,460 --> 00:35:19,460
Look, I'm not opposed to that.

652
00:35:19,460 --> 00:35:24,460
Maybe, I mean, I can't really explain to you how fucked those guys are.

653
00:35:24,460 --> 00:35:26,460
Do you guys know what Gal Gadot is?

654
00:35:26,460 --> 00:35:31,460
Yeah, that is a Mediterranean dish that I've had.

655
00:35:31,460 --> 00:35:38,460
It's egg roasted eggplant and a lot of like as a tar and other things. Yeah, that's true

656
00:35:38,460 --> 00:35:42,380
It was named after the city of Gal Gadot that lies

657
00:35:42,380 --> 00:35:46,340
Further east of here. Anyway, there's a band of

658
00:35:46,340 --> 00:35:49,480
Orcs from there that sort of frequent this area

659
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:57,320
they're gonna absolutely fuck up that city because they can't pay the fines that that the Gal Gadot collects, so

660
00:35:58,380 --> 00:36:05,700
That city's doomed unless we go back there or unless we go to Gal Gadot or we go to oh we go to idiot

661
00:36:05,700 --> 00:36:09,100
Village, I don't want to go to Gal Gadot. Okay, then we got to go to

662
00:36:09,100 --> 00:36:12,740
I'm a human they make me they'll make me a slave there

663
00:36:12,740 --> 00:36:21,420
Crazy, right? Well, we so so what's gonna happen is we go to idiot village and okay protect idiot village from the Gal

664
00:36:21,420 --> 00:36:26,960
Gadot people we could basically tell them I mean you just tell the idiot village people

665
00:36:27,580 --> 00:36:30,900
They take what if we just get them to move their town

666
00:36:30,900 --> 00:36:38,980
They barely have anything. I mean actually I haven't been there in about a month. This is still just all well scaffolding

667
00:36:38,980 --> 00:36:46,540
Well, there's I mean, I remember we went to a really nice in right a strange penis. Yeah strange penis in you know

668
00:36:46,540 --> 00:36:52,380
I feel like maybe we could get the entire population of the town to move to that in and just live there instead and then maybe

669
00:36:52,380 --> 00:36:54,920
They you know leave this the town there

670
00:36:55,460 --> 00:36:57,460
The orcs will think that they

671
00:36:57,460 --> 00:37:00,060
left

672
00:37:00,060 --> 00:37:05,700
Yeah, what if we scrap all this and we have a big barbecue yeah, we could

673
00:37:05,700 --> 00:37:10,420
We invite all those people

674
00:37:10,420 --> 00:37:16,420
We and the orcs and we can make it like Thanksgiving oh

675
00:37:16,420 --> 00:37:23,620
Yeah, if we bring if we bring enough people to that end then the Bart that stupid-ass bartender won't be able to say anything about

676
00:37:23,620 --> 00:37:27,940
it more of us than there are of him I still got a bone to pick with him he was

677
00:37:27,940 --> 00:37:32,020
very rude to me when I froze him in place magically oh you you froze him in

678
00:37:32,020 --> 00:37:36,860
place and did you steal liquor the little one here with the big balls did

679
00:37:36,860 --> 00:37:41,540
you steal the liquor I might have done that and he was a dick about it he was

680
00:37:41,540 --> 00:37:45,980
so rude so I think we should bring every it might have been my little thieving

00:39:08,380 --> 00:39:09,380

696
00:39:09,380 --> 00:39:12,380

00:39:34,380 --> 00:39:37,820
Like a real 2006 Braid going on here.

Yeah, I gotta fuck you.

702
00:39:40,700 --> 00:39:46,500
You know what Steval needs is a bag of chips.

00:39:46,500 --> 00:39:48,100
I don't need no chips, man.

704
00:39:48,100 --> 00:39:49,100
You need some chips.

705
00:39:49,100 --> 00:39:50,100
I don't eat chips.

706
00:39:50,100 --> 00:39:51,100
Come on, eat some chips.

707
00:39:51,100 --> 00:39:52,100
I eat this.

708
00:39:52,100 --> 00:39:53,100
What is that?

709
00:39:53,100 --> 00:39:59,580
I pull out my homemade flashlight that I made with the gruel and a sock and I start slurping

710
00:39:59,580 --> 00:40:00,580
it.

711
00:40:00,580 --> 00:40:01,580
Oh God.

712
00:40:01,580 --> 00:40:02,580
Oh, he nasty.

Oh, I'm nasty.

714
00:40:03,580 --> 00:40:06,180
Look at his little nasty ass.

715
00:40:06,180 --> 00:40:08,580
Oh man, I'm so small and disgusting.

716
00:40:08,580 --> 00:40:09,380
This is awful.

717
00:40:09,380 --> 00:40:10,980
There's a child still here.

718
00:40:10,980 --> 00:40:15,780
I think I I I mean I'm standing there like completely still just

719
00:40:15,780 --> 00:40:19,980
staring into space and I'm like, you know, dragons really be

720
00:40:19,980 --> 00:40:22,680
crazy as hell when you think about it for real.

721
00:40:22,680 --> 00:40:23,280
Get it.

722
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:24,180
Oh, man.

723
00:40:24,180 --> 00:40:25,380
Look at this guy.

724
00:40:25,380 --> 00:40:26,680
Look at this guy's eyes.

725
00:40:26,680 --> 00:40:28,580
There is red.

726
00:40:28,580 --> 00:40:30,580
There is red is my balls.

727
00:40:30,580 --> 00:40:32,680
You do have red balls.

728
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:34,380
They're they're really red on the bottom.

729
00:40:34,380 --> 00:40:36,080
They are dragged around.

730
00:40:36,080 --> 00:40:36,580
Actually.

731
00:40:36,580 --> 00:40:38,480
Yeah, they're really I look at it.

732
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:40,280
Patches balls and I go yo.

733
00:40:40,280 --> 00:40:46,880
Damn, I'm so high and so hungry.

734
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:50,780
Oh my God stupid little town and try to get some food.

735
00:40:50,780 --> 00:40:52,680
We should go back to high school.

736
00:40:52,680 --> 00:40:59,080
You know what I let's go back to that.

737
00:40:59,080 --> 00:40:59,680
Well, hold on.

738
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:00,080
Hold on.

739
00:41:00,080 --> 00:41:04,580
It's kind of if you guys want to travel at night, we can't just I don't want to.

740
00:41:04,580 --> 00:41:06,880
We might run into a little bit of trouble.

741
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:08,520
We can wait here for the night.

742
00:41:08,520 --> 00:41:09,980
Teleport us.

743
00:41:09,980 --> 00:41:12,080
I can't. I'm not just going to burn.

744
00:41:12,080 --> 00:41:13,680
I just make me lie.

745
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:15,520
You magic bitch.

746
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:17,880
I could make you like levitate.

747
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:20,980
Whoa. OK, I'm not levitating yet.

748
00:41:20,980 --> 00:41:24,080
Oh, it's pretty tight.

749
00:41:24,080 --> 00:41:27,220
What? Yeah.

750
00:41:27,220 --> 00:41:28,320
What did you just say?

751
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:30,220
I said that's pretty tight. He's levitating.

752
00:41:30,220 --> 00:41:33,720
Oh, yeah. Well, I don't think he was, but, you know,

753
00:41:33,720 --> 00:41:37,020
he's I guess there was some forced perspective.

754
00:41:37,020 --> 00:41:39,620
Yeah, yeah.

755
00:41:39,620 --> 00:41:42,220
That's what you think about it.

756
00:41:42,220 --> 00:41:43,720
It's like

757
00:41:43,720 --> 00:41:46,020
they're all kind of levitating.

758
00:41:46,020 --> 00:41:50,120
And you think like the brain is like not touching the ground.

759
00:41:50,120 --> 00:41:52,420
Oh, man, this guy needs some chips so bad.

760
00:41:52,420 --> 00:41:53,320
We got to go.

761
00:41:53,320 --> 00:41:56,820
Okay. Yeah, I think we should probably just

762
00:41:57,320 --> 00:42:04,060
He's all of it is Sullivan is fully decked out the wizard outfit. It's too big for him. I think we should probably

763
00:42:04,060 --> 00:42:08,740
Probably should either stay here the night or if we're gonna move out

764
00:42:08,740 --> 00:42:14,200
We should probably just make a plan in case we run into some not night monsters

765
00:42:14,200 --> 00:42:16,660
And you know what I could stand to go to sleep

766
00:42:16,660 --> 00:42:20,240
Yeah, me too. I'm pretty sure yeah

767
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:24,360
You guys know

768
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:27,120
Mr. Mr. What fook you

769
00:42:27,120 --> 00:42:35,460
Yeah, yeah, that's good. Yeah, fuck you. Uh, I don't think I've said I don't know if I've cussed like that in this voice

770
00:42:35,460 --> 00:42:38,640
It's not a cuss word. It's his name. Hey

771
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:42,960
We don't cuss. Oh, sorry. You don't cuss

772
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:52,260
When do you think those orcs will come by they gonna come by tonight? I don't know

773
00:42:52,260 --> 00:42:57,260
Oh, oh, uh, all right.

774
00:42:57,260 --> 00:42:58,260
I guess be quiet.

775
00:42:58,260 --> 00:43:00,260
We're trying to sleep over here.

776
00:43:00,260 --> 00:43:03,260
I guess it's sort of talking to talk all night.

777
00:43:03,260 --> 00:43:06,260
Yeah, fuck me.

778
00:43:06,260 --> 00:43:07,260
You guys go to bed.

779
00:43:07,260 --> 00:43:11,260
So yeah, you guys wake up next morning.

780
00:43:11,260 --> 00:43:14,260
You're all snuggled in your wizard outfits.

781
00:43:14,260 --> 00:43:19,260
And it's daybreak is arrived.

782
00:43:19,260 --> 00:43:29,260
and uh, uh, why me or fuck you wakes up, um, and uh, not a sort of a nudges you, uh, uh,

783
00:43:29,260 --> 00:43:30,260
Patrick.

784
00:43:30,260 --> 00:43:31,260
He says, Hey, fuck me.

785
00:43:31,260 --> 00:43:32,260
You ready?

786
00:43:32,260 --> 00:43:33,260
Yeah.

787
00:43:33,260 --> 00:43:34,260
What for what?

788
00:43:34,260 --> 00:43:35,260
We're going to eat.

789
00:43:35,260 --> 00:43:36,260
I remember.

790
00:43:36,260 --> 00:43:39,940
I think I might've greened out last night.

791
00:43:39,940 --> 00:43:41,940
I don't, that's funny.

792
00:43:41,940 --> 00:43:42,940
Yeah.

793
00:43:42,940 --> 00:43:43,940
I don't remember.

794
00:43:43,940 --> 00:43:44,940
You don't.

795
00:43:44,940 --> 00:43:49,220
Uh, well we were gonna go to the town and, um, oh, we were going to the barbecue.

796
00:43:49,220 --> 00:43:52,300
Oh, well, I think that was part of it, but it was also

797
00:43:52,300 --> 00:43:55,940
That was the only thing we planned

798
00:43:55,940 --> 00:43:59,820
Well, we were gonna go there and try to evacuate the town

799
00:43:59,820 --> 00:44:03,640
Fuck that why not just have a big barbecue

800
00:44:03,640 --> 00:44:09,000
And you want to try the bar? Okay, we could just try the barbecue angle. We could just see how that okay

801
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:15,420
I'm okay with that. You know, you don't sound okay with that. I'm just worried about how it could turn out but

802
00:44:16,860 --> 00:44:21,620
Orcs love barbecue and they're drawn to the smell like a shark to blood

803
00:44:21,620 --> 00:44:26,500
This is true. Yeah, but I thought we were inviting the orcs to the barbecue

804
00:44:26,500 --> 00:44:33,580
Yeah, I think we're trying to reframe the situation where it's like wait wait or take barbecue. What are we thinking about?

805
00:44:33,580 --> 00:44:37,980
Right. I don't even know. The only problem is how we're gonna get any meat

806
00:44:37,980 --> 00:44:43,760
We eat you we could yeah, we could kill some of the villagers. We just kill you eat you

807
00:44:43,820 --> 00:44:46,220
Well, the orcs would like the villager meat.

808
00:44:46,220 --> 00:44:53,300
Yeah, why don't we do why don't we just move all the villagers into the inn so the bartender gets mad and then we can cook

809
00:44:53,300 --> 00:44:54,500
the bartender

810
00:44:54,500 --> 00:44:57,500
Wait, I have an idea. Okay, so here's a problem

811
00:44:57,500 --> 00:45:04,280
We need to get the orcs and the villagers in the same room right to let them chop it up, right?

812
00:45:04,280 --> 00:45:08,860
But the orcs love eating the villagers and we don't have any meat

813
00:45:08,980 --> 00:45:15,340
So what if we go to the town we kill everybody in it and turn them into delicious

814
00:45:15,340 --> 00:45:21,940
Barbecue meat right and then we invite the orcs and then they can eat the barbecue

815
00:45:21,940 --> 00:45:26,380
So we want us to kill the whole town and

816
00:45:26,380 --> 00:45:32,220
As long as I get to eat some ribs, I don't care

817
00:45:32,220 --> 00:45:36,240
Okay, shit. You guys want to go let's do it. You guys want to eat people

818
00:45:36,920 --> 00:45:44,200
We're doing it. Well, I didn't you seem a little excited. I never said anything about us eating the people. Yeah

819
00:45:44,200 --> 00:45:51,760
For the orcs. Oh, all right. You scrapped that plan. You're a man. No, I'm just trying to figure out what the vibe is here

820
00:45:51,760 --> 00:45:58,000
We're let's go. Let's hide the villagers in your cave. Okay, good idea. So yeah, you guys want to get back?

821
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:02,320
Yeah, idiot village. Hey you guys wander back

822
00:46:03,520 --> 00:46:06,920
It takes, you know, like a good few hours to get there.

823
00:46:06,920 --> 00:46:12,420
You get back and yeah, the idiot villagers are sort of just

824
00:46:12,420 --> 00:46:15,520
doing what they were doing, you know, clipping through the

825
00:46:15,520 --> 00:46:21,820
environment and you know, whatever it is stupid NPCs do and

826
00:46:21,820 --> 00:46:27,320
they see all of you come back dressed in wizard robes and

827
00:46:27,320 --> 00:46:32,720
the mayor or I guess the sheriff mayor Sheriff Ted goes you

828
00:46:32,720 --> 00:46:42,040
see him and he look everybody four five six ten village idiots and everyone

829
00:46:42,040 --> 00:46:49,400
starts to gather around and they're like oh wow hey hey no I'm the mayor wait

830
00:46:49,400 --> 00:46:57,080
you're the mayor yeah I'm the mayor but you're dressed like a village idiot well

831
00:46:57,080 --> 00:47:01,800
a village idiot can be a mayor. And they see them all go, "Oh, I feel

832
00:47:01,800 --> 00:47:05,720
shit being mayor." And as the mayor, I decree that a law.

833
00:47:05,720 --> 00:47:12,680
Oh, well, I guess there's no stopping that with the mayor saying it.

834
00:47:12,680 --> 00:47:14,760
Okay. That's right.

835
00:47:14,760 --> 00:47:23,400
Yeah. Well, if, okay, but then, then are you all the mayor?

836
00:47:23,400 --> 00:47:24,800
Yeah, we're all there.

837
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:25,800
It's not only him.

838
00:47:25,800 --> 00:47:27,000
He's mostly the mayor.

839
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:27,800
This guy.

840
00:47:27,800 --> 00:47:29,000
Fuck you.

841
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:31,400
Yeah, I'm a girl.

842
00:47:31,400 --> 00:47:36,700
My name is fuck you and I'm the mayor of this town and some

843
00:47:36,700 --> 00:47:38,900
things are going to start changing around here.

844
00:47:38,900 --> 00:47:44,100
The first thing that has to change is we need to leave here

845
00:47:44,100 --> 00:47:45,500
or we're going to die.

846
00:47:45,500 --> 00:47:52,700
So let's go to my cave where the bats fuck but there's no orcs

847
00:47:52,700 --> 00:47:53,700
that are going to kill us.

848
00:47:53,700 --> 00:47:55,800
How does that sound?

849
00:47:55,800 --> 00:48:01,500
And you see them all go like, we'll follow you wherever you

850
00:48:01,500 --> 00:48:02,300
go.

851
00:48:02,300 --> 00:48:05,700
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, and you're all going to throw us a

852
00:48:05,700 --> 00:48:07,000
barbecue after.

853
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:07,800
Yeah.

854
00:48:07,800 --> 00:48:08,500
Wow.

855
00:48:08,500 --> 00:48:11,300
That sounds like a great idea with human meat.

856
00:48:11,300 --> 00:48:13,500
Well, I don't oh shit.

857
00:48:13,500 --> 00:48:16,000
Oh, we'll figure that out.

858
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:18,000
Christ.

859
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:18,500
All right.

860
00:48:18,500 --> 00:48:22,200
But yeah, let's go to the let's go to the cave.

861
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:30,480
Okay, yeah. So you guys are marching with like, I guess like 50 to 60 people towards a cave

862
00:48:30,480 --> 00:48:36,960
and you're marching through the plains. So at this point, you're kind of a...

863
00:48:36,960 --> 00:48:43,920
I turned all the idiots on. I'm like, "You don't have to march. You can just walk.

864
00:48:45,200 --> 00:48:54,320
marching the entire time just because we're in a group just wanted to clarify but i thought this

865
00:48:54,320 --> 00:49:03,520
was an rts oh [ __ ] i could just walk okay we're gonna walk now guys all right but just walk

866
00:49:03,520 --> 00:49:12,960
in a group don't let anybody leave the group okay so and lift your knees up when you're walking and

867
00:49:12,960 --> 00:49:15,000
You know, do it all in time.

868
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:15,560
All right.

869
00:49:15,560 --> 00:49:19,840
Yeah, do it all in the same motion, but don't.

870
00:49:19,840 --> 00:49:21,960
No marching.

871
00:49:21,960 --> 00:49:24,860
No marching and don't get lost.

872
00:49:24,860 --> 00:49:27,060
Yeah. Buddy system. Everyone is your buddy.

873
00:49:27,060 --> 00:49:31,140
All right. We're going to do some rolls to see how they know across the play.

874
00:49:31,140 --> 00:49:33,160
So it's not them.

875
00:49:33,160 --> 00:49:35,840
It's just it's just that they are really stupid.

876
00:49:35,840 --> 00:49:37,800
And they're going to go so much.

877
00:49:37,800 --> 00:49:40,300
Yeah. Let's see how they do.

878
00:49:40,340 --> 00:49:44,440
So we're going to do a collective intelligence role.

879
00:49:44,440 --> 00:49:48,640
So I'm going to average out to pretty low.

880
00:49:48,640 --> 00:49:53,240
Wow, a solid.

881
00:49:53,240 --> 00:49:57,940
Okay, so only 25% of them get lost on the way.

882
00:49:57,940 --> 00:50:01,540
It was it could have been a lot worse.

883
00:50:01,540 --> 00:50:03,640
I'm telling you it was very impressive.

884
00:50:03,640 --> 00:50:06,540
Yeah, so 25% of them are just gone.

885
00:50:06,540 --> 00:50:09,640
You guys look turn around and they're just like they just

886
00:50:09,640 --> 00:50:12,040
peel off and you just don't know where they go.

887
00:50:12,040 --> 00:50:13,440
As you're walking.

888
00:50:13,440 --> 00:50:16,840
It is just walk in the wrong direction.

889
00:50:16,840 --> 00:50:20,740
Yeah, just walk in the wrong direction fall down a hole.

890
00:50:20,740 --> 00:50:29,240
Gone and you see you all right arrive at the cave and it's

891
00:50:29,240 --> 00:50:32,840
it's a closer to like sort of mid-afternoon like dusk now

892
00:50:33,940 --> 00:50:38,580
and you see the, uh, you see, uh, Fook you, uh, look at all,

893
00:50:38,580 --> 00:50:42,420
everybody who's in, oh, wow, this is actually a lot better than

894
00:50:42,420 --> 00:50:46,620
the last time we tried to do this. Um, okay.

895
00:50:46,620 --> 00:50:52,040
Well now we'll just sort of wait here for a little while and then,

896
00:50:52,040 --> 00:50:56,780
you know, if the Orcs come here for some, whatever reason, you know,

897
00:50:56,780 --> 00:51:01,180
you all hurry into the cave and keep yourselves hidden and

898
00:51:01,620 --> 00:51:04,780
we will protect you

899
00:51:04,780 --> 00:51:08,620
but i don't have them going to cave now

900
00:51:08,620 --> 00:51:09,420
i guess

901
00:51:09,420 --> 00:51:10,000
yet

902
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:10,860
witty

903
00:51:10,860 --> 00:51:15,420
white why add up in the cave yet i'll make it complicated to snow and you know

904
00:51:15,420 --> 00:51:17,340
everyone in the bills get a decade

905
00:51:17,340 --> 00:51:19,540
uh... okay like all that

906
00:51:19,540 --> 00:51:20,980

just getting not him

908
00:51:23,340 --> 00:51:26,260

uh...

910
00:51:27,540 --> 00:51:29,260

914
00:51:34,780 --> 00:51:38,880
You all start to hear you all start guys are like hanging out

915
00:51:38,880 --> 00:51:39,880
outside the cave.

916
00:51:39,880 --> 00:51:40,980
You guys light in a fire.

917
00:51:40,980 --> 00:51:41,880
I'm hanging out.

918
00:51:41,880 --> 00:51:44,580
We're just doing out to the cave and I'm just I'm repeatedly

919
00:51:44,580 --> 00:51:47,280

Times in a row.

Boo-boo-boo.

923
00:51:54,880 --> 00:51:56,080

Yeah.

946
00:53:04,580 --> 00:53:09,900
You know, they kind of just have been like, kind of like fodder this whole time.

947
00:53:09,900 --> 00:53:10,900
Oh, absolutely.

948
00:53:10,900 --> 00:53:14,140
I'm trying to humanize them as much as possible.

949
00:53:14,140 --> 00:53:16,700
It's it's kind of easy to forget at times.

950
00:53:16,700 --> 00:53:17,700
Oh,

951
00:53:17,700 --> 00:53:18,700

952
00:53:18,700 --> 00:53:22,500
All right, hold on.

953
00:53:22,500 --> 00:53:23,500
Let me try that again.

954
00:53:23,500 --> 00:53:24,500
Then.

955
00:53:24,500 --> 00:53:39,060
the

956
00:53:39,060 --> 00:53:48,980
guys fuck around and fuck with the townsfolk. You hear like a horse footsteps or something,

957
00:53:48,980 --> 00:53:54,820
some horse like thing. I bet it's a horse. You see in the distance, oh, it's a horse

958
00:53:54,820 --> 00:54:03,180
alright. It's like a, it's a big horse though. You see like six or seven strong looking fucking

959
00:54:03,180 --> 00:54:11,180
orcs, orcs, a couple of them are half orcs riding up to the mouth of the cave.

960
00:54:11,180 --> 00:54:15,480
And you see them, they sort of stand in front of you guys are about like 30 feet

961
00:54:15,480 --> 00:54:20,820
away and they're looking at you all and they say, why me?

962
00:54:20,820 --> 00:54:24,620
And this is, ah, hello, Thorax.

963
00:54:24,620 --> 00:54:26,440
And you guys are no, no, fuck you.

964
00:54:26,440 --> 00:54:28,040
Not why me?

965
00:54:28,040 --> 00:54:28,740
Fuck you.

966
00:54:28,740 --> 00:54:30,480
What?

967
00:54:30,480 --> 00:54:31,780
Tell him, tell him your name.

968
00:54:31,780 --> 00:54:32,780
Fuck you.

969
00:54:33,080 --> 00:54:35,600
Fuck you, not why me, fuck you.

970
00:54:35,600 --> 00:54:36,680
- Fuck you.

971
00:54:36,680 --> 00:54:37,520
- Exactly.

972
00:54:37,520 --> 00:54:38,360
- That's his name.

973
00:54:38,360 --> 00:54:39,260
- Yeah, yeah.

974
00:54:39,260 --> 00:54:40,200
- Oh, oh, okay.

975
00:54:40,200 --> 00:54:41,540
Oh shit.

976
00:54:41,540 --> 00:54:42,380
Why me?

977
00:54:42,380 --> 00:54:43,220
You didn't tell, fuck you.

978
00:54:43,220 --> 00:54:45,840
You didn't tell me you were changing your name.

979
00:54:45,840 --> 00:54:46,680
All right, well.

980
00:54:46,680 --> 00:54:48,600
- You actually got it pretty fast, honestly.

981
00:54:48,600 --> 00:54:50,720
That usually takes people a lot longer,

982
00:54:50,720 --> 00:54:54,220
especially when you add fuck me into the equation.

983
00:54:54,220 --> 00:54:55,400
- Oh yeah.

984
00:54:55,400 --> 00:54:58,200
No, I mean, wizards always do shit like this.

985
00:54:58,200 --> 00:54:59,560
They're just trying to find themselves.

986
00:54:59,560 --> 00:55:00,400
They're very annoying.

987
00:55:00,400 --> 00:55:01,440
- Yeah, I get it.

988
00:55:01,440 --> 00:55:06,440
Look, it's been a while.

989
00:55:06,440 --> 00:55:10,200
We went to the village, we were looking for payment.

990
00:55:10,200 --> 00:55:12,360
Nobody was there.

991
00:55:12,360 --> 00:55:15,460
We found about 25 or so other guys

992
00:55:15,460 --> 00:55:17,160
just sort of wandering around

993
00:55:17,160 --> 00:55:20,240
and the kind of a trail of them led us here.

994
00:55:20,240 --> 00:55:21,240
- Did they pay you?

995
00:55:21,240 --> 00:55:25,320
- No, they had dick on them, if anything at all.

996
00:55:25,320 --> 00:55:26,160
- Why have you looked there?

997
00:55:26,160 --> 00:55:28,080
- I'm sure a few of them had penises.

998
00:55:28,080 --> 00:55:29,480
- What? - Did they pay you?

999
00:55:30,580 --> 00:55:33,760
All of them had penises, regardless of gender,

1000
00:55:33,760 --> 00:55:35,460
and none of them paid me.

1001
00:55:35,460 --> 00:55:38,500
And they led to here.

1002
00:55:38,500 --> 00:55:40,180
And I could see now we have four

1003
00:55:40,180 --> 00:55:44,060
who are clipping the sides of the cave right now, so.

1004
00:55:44,060 --> 00:55:45,180
- All right.

1005
00:55:45,180 --> 00:55:47,740
How much do they owe? - What's going on?

1006
00:55:47,740 --> 00:55:51,780
Oh, it's how much that they owe Gal Gadot.

1007
00:55:51,780 --> 00:55:53,100
Not me, Thorax.

1008
00:55:53,100 --> 00:55:55,740
(all talking over each other)

1009
00:55:55,740 --> 00:55:57,060
- You guys, you guys tell me,

1010
00:55:57,060 --> 00:55:58,460
just give me a number, bitch.

1011
00:55:58,460 --> 00:55:59,500
And you guys look at them,

1012
00:55:59,500 --> 00:56:04,060
And you realize that you recognize him actually from the Strange Penis Inn.

1013
00:56:04,060 --> 00:56:07,260
He was he was part of that group of guys who were leaning against the

1014
00:56:07,260 --> 00:56:10,860
the wall on the bench on the side there.

1015
00:56:10,860 --> 00:56:13,900
Wait a second.

1016
00:56:13,900 --> 00:56:15,940
You're the guy from the wall.

1017
00:56:15,940 --> 00:56:22,260
Oh, oh, you've been to the Strange Penis Inn then.

1018
00:56:22,260 --> 00:56:24,900
Yeah. Yeah, it's a cool place.

1019
00:56:24,900 --> 00:56:26,600
That bartender sucks, right?

1020
00:56:26,600 --> 00:56:28,200
Otto? Yeah, he's a bit of a prick.

1021
00:56:28,200 --> 00:56:29,200
What are you going to do?

1022
00:56:29,200 --> 00:56:31,200
I'm going to freeze him magically.

1023
00:56:31,200 --> 00:56:32,200
Oh, damn.

1024
00:56:32,200 --> 00:56:33,200
All right.

1025
00:56:33,200 --> 00:56:34,200
You guys are tough.

1026
00:56:34,200 --> 00:56:35,200
That's pretty cool.

1027
00:56:35,200 --> 00:56:36,200
Yeah.

1028
00:56:36,200 --> 00:56:37,200
Wait a minute.

1029
00:56:37,200 --> 00:56:43,240
And now he as he hears you guys like rapping about like how you guys would fuck with a

1030
00:56:43,240 --> 00:56:44,240
human bartender.

1031
00:56:44,240 --> 00:56:46,240
He's like, oh, shit.

1032
00:56:46,240 --> 00:56:48,240
Yo, yo, Doug.

1033
00:56:48,240 --> 00:56:49,240
What?

1034
00:56:49,240 --> 00:56:52,240
These are the guys I was fucking telling you about.

1035
00:56:52,240 --> 00:56:55,240
Oh, oh, these are the guys at the Brave Lion.

1036
00:56:55,240 --> 00:56:56,240
Yeah.

1037
00:56:56,240 --> 00:56:57,240
Yeah.

1038
00:56:57,240 --> 00:57:03,160
Fuck with the brave lions, right? Is that bad? It's fucking awesome, man. All right, cool suck

1039
00:57:03,160 --> 00:57:09,320
Well, yeah fucking losers. God damn. Okay. Yeah, I knew I recognized your faces

1040
00:57:09,320 --> 00:57:13,800
You guys are by the way much better looking in those drawings if you guys. Oh, thanks

1041
00:57:13,800 --> 00:57:17,960
Like I remember you on that wall like it was yesterday. Yeah

1042
00:57:17,960 --> 00:57:24,140
I might have been I'm a beautiful man. You rode that wall. Oh, so well, okay

1043
00:57:24,200 --> 00:57:27,160
There's a line and I'm here for it. So

1044
00:57:27,160 --> 00:57:32,140
Okay, yeah, maybe we could what's let's try to work something out here, okay you guys

1045
00:57:32,140 --> 00:57:39,480
Okay. Wow, this is great. I'm so excited to meet you guys. It's just man those guys those guys fucking suck-ass

1046
00:57:39,480 --> 00:57:44,080
They just been trying to fuck with we have we have these great slaves and they just want to fucking ruin it

1047
00:57:44,080 --> 00:57:47,680
They fucking pricks. Oh, they're trying to take away your slaves, man

1048
00:57:51,120 --> 00:57:53,800
It's awful man, it should be illegal. I

1049
00:57:53,800 --> 00:58:00,920
Have been saying that and then meanwhile that stupid fucking King Nardwuar now wants to make it all nice and hunky-dory

1050
00:58:00,920 --> 00:58:03,680
the fucking asshole anyway, so

1051
00:58:03,680 --> 00:58:06,680
Appreciate that

1052
00:58:06,680 --> 00:58:14,120
But yeah, they definitely owe us some money. So who's in charge then? Are you guys you guys in charge of these basically a council?

1053
00:58:14,120 --> 00:58:20,880
Yeah, we're pretty much all in charge. All right, but I guess technically but fuck is the man. Fuck you. Yeah

1054
00:58:20,880 --> 00:58:24,320
So if you're about to say anything that has to do with a money amount, it does.

1055
00:58:24,320 --> 00:58:26,520
It's OK. All right.

1056
00:58:26,520 --> 00:58:29,180
Loud and clear, fellas. OK.

1057
00:58:29,180 --> 00:58:34,080
Thorax. Look, man, you know, these guys aren't good for it.

1058
00:58:34,080 --> 00:58:35,920
Yeah, of course I know that.

1059
00:58:35,920 --> 00:58:38,160
So what do you want? What do you want?

1060
00:58:38,160 --> 00:58:41,020
Well, they could be our slaves.

1061
00:58:41,020 --> 00:58:43,420
That's kind of always one of the good solutions.

1062
00:58:43,420 --> 00:58:45,920
We could eat them.

1063
00:58:45,920 --> 00:58:48,280
Who is talking right now?

1064
00:58:48,280 --> 00:58:51,000
Hold on, let me try to find a way to delineate the voices.

1065
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:55,440
So this is how about this is thorax, right?

1066
00:58:55,440 --> 00:58:57,080
He sounds a little bit more like this.

1067
00:58:57,080 --> 00:58:58,800
I'll put him in this register.

1068
00:58:58,800 --> 00:59:01,320
He sounds more like my way to hold.

1069
00:59:01,320 --> 00:59:03,720
How about that? Yeah, there we go. I found it.

1070
00:59:03,720 --> 00:59:06,200
I found that sounds about right.

1071
00:59:06,200 --> 00:59:07,960
Yeah, I found that is a good voice.

1072
00:59:07,960 --> 00:59:10,400
Isn't that a better voice there? Yeah, it took me a little bit,

1073
00:59:10,400 --> 00:59:14,320
but I had to I had to sort of search in my throat to find it.

1074
00:59:14,320 --> 00:59:16,800
But I sound like a John Benjamin with a cold.

1075
00:59:17,040 --> 00:59:29,480
the

1076
00:59:29,480 --> 00:59:47,160
this

1077
00:59:47,160 --> 00:59:50,120
I got back to the H. John Benjamin cold voices.

1078
00:59:50,120 --> 00:59:50,800
Was this it?

1079
00:59:50,800 --> 00:59:51,320
I'm trying to.

1080
00:59:51,320 --> 00:59:52,720
Yeah, that's that's about it.

1081
00:59:52,720 --> 00:59:53,360
All right, good.

1082
00:59:53,360 --> 00:59:57,800
Look, you can make them my slaves or, you know.

1083
00:59:57,800 --> 01:00:02,400
Look, if you guys want, you could come with me to Galgado

1084
01:00:02,400 --> 01:00:06,520
and you could try to work something out with the with the fellas over there.

1085
01:00:06,520 --> 01:00:11,620
So that or they're my slaves or I mean, we're going to eat them.

1086
01:00:11,620 --> 01:00:14,920
Well, here's here's my here's my thinking.

1087
01:00:15,460 --> 01:00:16,620
Okay.

1088
01:00:16,620 --> 01:00:18,300
So how about we turn

1089
01:00:18,300 --> 01:00:22,180
their land

1090
01:00:22,180 --> 01:00:26,060
into a part of Gal Gadot?

1091
01:00:26,060 --> 01:00:27,060
Amusement park.

1092
01:00:27,060 --> 01:00:28,180
Oh.

1093
01:00:28,180 --> 01:00:29,340
No, really.

1094
01:00:29,340 --> 01:00:32,460
A part of Gal Gadot that is an amusement park.

1095
01:00:32,460 --> 01:00:36,100
And all of them will be the walk-around characters.

1096
01:00:36,100 --> 01:00:37,340
And it's called--

1097
01:00:37,340 --> 01:00:38,420
And it is called--

1098
01:00:38,420 --> 01:00:39,860
Idiot Land. Stupid Bill.

1099
01:00:39,860 --> 01:00:40,700
Yeah.

1100
01:00:40,700 --> 01:00:42,180
Idiot Land, Stupid Bill.

1101
01:00:42,180 --> 01:00:43,740
It could be like an Idiot Land

1102
01:00:43,740 --> 01:00:45,180
and then there could be like an Epcot.

1103
01:00:45,180 --> 01:00:50,060
Well, it's like there's an Epcot and it has like a fork in a microwave.

1104
01:00:50,060 --> 01:00:57,460
So basically they would kind of be your slaves, but they would entertain you for you.

1105
01:00:57,460 --> 01:01:02,060
But also the best part is they're so stupid they wouldn't even realize they were slaves.

1106
01:01:02,060 --> 01:01:04,260
Not just be living their life.

1107
01:01:04,260 --> 01:01:06,820
It'll be the first amusement park in the realm.

1108
01:01:06,820 --> 01:01:12,380
So you're going to be making a lot of money off that way more than you'd get from.

1109
01:01:12,380 --> 01:01:15,440
it say, uh, thorax presents.

1110
01:01:15,440 --> 01:01:16,500
Yeah.

1111
01:01:16,500 --> 01:01:16,900
Yeah.

1112
01:01:16,900 --> 01:01:17,340
That's great.

1113
01:01:17,340 --> 01:01:21,840
All you guys need a couple of, a couple of one way mirrors so that they, and

1114
01:01:21,840 --> 01:01:24,140
it actually better cause they get confused by their reflection.

1115
01:01:24,140 --> 01:01:25,180
Oh yeah.

1116
01:01:25,180 --> 01:01:27,760
So it'll be like, you ever tried, you ever tried throwing a

1117
01:01:27,760 --> 01:01:29,260
flaming log at one of them?

1118
01:01:29,260 --> 01:01:31,380
Uh, this guy, this guy knows me.

1119
01:01:31,380 --> 01:01:33,500
All right.

1120
01:01:33,500 --> 01:01:37,700
Uh, roll a, uh, let's roll a persuasion check guys.

1121
01:01:37,700 --> 01:01:39,460
It's pretty, uh, all three.

1122
01:01:39,460 --> 01:01:40,380
24.

1123
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:42,860
Yeah, all three and we'll sort of average it out.

1124
01:01:42,860 --> 01:01:44,140
1214.

1125
01:01:44,140 --> 01:01:46,160
I mean, that's pretty good.

1126
01:01:46,160 --> 01:01:47,600
Honestly, you also got that.

1127
01:01:47,600 --> 01:01:51,260
God, Patrick, your fucking charisma is crazy.

1128
01:01:51,260 --> 01:01:54,100
Oh God. OK, cool.

1129
01:01:54,100 --> 01:01:56,440
Yeah, you see he goes, he looks his guys, you see them.

1130
01:01:56,440 --> 01:02:00,440
You see also that one of them, not Doug, but one of the other ones

1131
01:02:00,440 --> 01:02:05,340
who's carrying like a staff is sort of squinting his eyes at you guys.

1132
01:02:05,340 --> 01:02:07,860
You guys clock that he doesn't look like he's going to like do anything or say

1133
01:02:07,860 --> 01:02:10,980
anything, but you guys clock that somebody in his group is a

1134
01:02:10,980 --> 01:02:14,100
little bit more skeptical of you guys. But yeah, he turns to

1135
01:02:14,100 --> 01:02:20,020
you all and says, alright, I mean, be honest. I **** like it.

1136
01:02:20,020 --> 01:02:23,860
I think it's a good idea. I think the people of Gal could

1137
01:02:23,860 --> 01:02:28,660
do could use some sort of a distraction from the woes of

1138
01:02:28,660 --> 01:02:34,500
living but yeah, I mean they're barely living. Oh, it's not

1139
01:02:34,500 --> 01:02:36,380
It's not. It's no way to live.

1140
01:02:36,380 --> 01:02:37,220
No.

1141
01:02:37,220 --> 01:02:38,860
And, but here's the thing.

1142
01:02:38,860 --> 01:02:40,420
If we want to pull this off,

1143
01:02:40,420 --> 01:02:44,860
you guys then have to come with me to Gal Gadot and be,

1144
01:02:44,860 --> 01:02:48,620
you know, I need to prove that I have sort of like investors

1145
01:02:48,620 --> 01:02:50,220
or businessmen or wherever you guys are.

1146
01:02:50,220 --> 01:02:52,100
Yeah, we can do business.

1147
01:02:52,100 --> 01:02:53,020
That's easy.

1148
01:02:53,020 --> 01:02:55,980
So you're telling me you have like a room in Gal Gadot,

1149
01:02:55,980 --> 01:02:56,820
right?

1150
01:02:56,820 --> 01:02:59,660
With maybe like a long hallway walking up to it.

1151
01:02:59,660 --> 01:03:01,940
And you got say like, I don't know,

1152
01:03:01,940 --> 01:03:06,020
five very powerful people who might be willing to invest in our idea.

1153
01:03:06,020 --> 01:03:09,340
Something like that.

1154
01:03:09,340 --> 01:03:11,520
Exactly that, please.

1155
01:03:11,520 --> 01:03:13,980
Yeah, pretty much for the next one.

1156
01:03:13,980 --> 01:03:15,420
Exactly that.

1157
01:03:15,420 --> 01:03:18,480
Basically, exactly that.

1158
01:03:18,480 --> 01:03:21,380
But then we do it for the next thing.

1159
01:03:21,380 --> 01:03:23,780
Please, please, please, please.

1160
01:03:23,780 --> 01:03:26,540
Oh, I guess it's happening.

1161
01:03:26,540 --> 01:03:30,780
And maybe there's a voiceover that explains our idea as we walk up to the door.

1162
01:03:30,820 --> 01:03:33,860
Oh, I guess it's a hundred percent happening.

1163
01:03:33,860 --> 01:03:35,860
I cannot, I cannot wait for this.

1164
01:03:35,860 --> 01:03:38,860
Let me tell you what, I'm gonna say we'll do it.

1165
01:03:38,860 --> 01:03:39,860
Yeah, this is happening.

1166
01:03:39,860 --> 01:03:40,860
This is happening.

1167
01:03:40,860 --> 01:03:41,860
This is a hundred percent happening.

1168
01:03:41,860 --> 01:03:42,860
And, uh, oh yeah.

1169
01:03:42,860 --> 01:03:43,860
And, uh, are we done?

1170
01:03:43,860 --> 01:03:44,860
Is that?

1171
01:03:44,860 --> 01:03:45,860
I think an hour and five minutes.

1172
01:03:45,860 --> 01:03:46,860
Okay.

1173
01:03:46,860 --> 01:03:47,860
I was gonna say, was that fair?

1174
01:03:47,860 --> 01:03:49,860
[laughter]

1175
01:03:49,860 --> 01:03:51,860
And uh, are we done?

1176
01:03:51,860 --> 01:03:53,860
Is that...

1177
01:03:53,860 --> 01:03:55,860
[music]

1178
01:03:55,860 --> 01:03:57,860
Okay, I was gonna say...

1179
01:03:57,860 --> 01:03:59,860
