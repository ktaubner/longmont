2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:22,920
Last time on Trebuchet Village, the heroes came face to face with Connoria, the warlock who served

3
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:29,800
The Jester and his nasty changeling familiar Impy. After nearly killing Patrick Yodar,

4
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:35,560
Sullivan's string of good luck and Dogen's decisive blow took out Conneria and granted the gang the

5
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:41,400
Yoni Egg of Yore. After raiding his hovel, finding a strange substance that the gang made Sullivan

6
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:45,800
drink, our heroes headed back towards the White Woman of the Woods to give her the Yoni Egg of

7
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:51,480
Basket. But not before The Jester attempted to make a deal with them. He'd gift them a magical

8
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:58,320
staff that had happy faces and frowny faces, much to evil Stievel's chagrin, and freedom

9
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:01,920
from the woods if they handed him the yoni egg of Baskin.

10
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:07,160
They, in my opinion, confusingly refused his offer, and instead handed the egg to the white

11
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:10,720
woman, who proceeded to do what you do with such a thing.

12
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:15,680
Her magical yeast infection spread throughout the Whippet Woods, which became more normal,

13
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:20,160
with squirrels and birds and little flowers and nice trees, nothing laughing or cackling

14
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:22,640
or being weird and dark crystal-y.

15
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:27,000
The crew stayed the night, morning, and a bit of the afternoon in her conch shell home in

16
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,720
the lake before she tossed them out and sent them to take care of the kitsunes once and

17
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:32,080
for all.

18
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:36,920
Arriving at the scene, they saw a massive tent made of terrible multicolored detritus,

19
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:42,480
organic or otherwise, looking like a freaky circus tent, with a massive foxhole underneath.

20
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:48,080
In the tent they saw the massive beast that belonged to the Vegas brothers, Dean and Luca,

21
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:52,640
saw that it was a massive Sasquatchian thing indeed, except its head and face were that

22
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:57,940
of a human clown. They saw him farting and pranking the Vegas brothers who were tied

23
00:01:57,940 --> 00:02:03,760
up at the center of the tent. Also, the beloved Kubler elves were shackled and plodding along,

24
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:08,940
sad little slaves to the horrid kitsune's designs. Rather than remaining hidden, Patrick

25
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:13,660
Jodar fired an arrow at the tent for some reason, but it was enough to begin combat

26
00:02:13,660 --> 00:02:17,260
and earnest. With the white woman of the woods power restored,

27
00:02:17,260 --> 00:02:19,960
animal friends came to the aid of our heroes and set upon the

28
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:23,760
Kitsunes. The leader of the Kitsunes, Bussy Kitsune, faces

29
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:28,360
our heroes in combat, while a Sasquatchian clown seems to

30
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:32,460
ready himself for the eventual showdown between the outsiders

31
00:02:32,460 --> 00:02:35,160
from Trebuchet Village and himself.

32
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:38,560
Should have cleaned up that sentence.

33
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:41,160
But yeah, so we're in the middle of a battle.

34
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:45,360
And looking at the.

35
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:49,840
Initiative order from last time, we're back to the top of the order.

36
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:52,600
It is.

37
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:58,700
Say I wrote BK, so that probably stands for Burger King.

38
00:02:58,700 --> 00:03:00,840
Burger King. Burger King.

39
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:03,180
Ooh, I guess it's Burger King's turn.

40
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:06,520
Yo, and I think I am the burger king of the party.

41
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:07,920
So I really should go.

42
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:09,580
I realize it's Bussy Kitsune.

43
00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:12,620
I'm sorry. Not Burger King.

44
00:03:12,620 --> 00:03:14,620
So it is Busty Kitsune's turn.

45
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:20,060
So Busty Kitsune has been shooting those like darts at you guys from afar.

46
00:03:20,060 --> 00:03:23,580
And so he's going to continue to try to do that.

47
00:03:23,580 --> 00:03:25,580
So I'm going to roll for that.

48
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:28,620
Last time he shot it at you, Patrick Chiodar.

49
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:30,620
He's going to go for Dogen this time.

50
00:03:30,620 --> 00:03:32,620
- No. - I jump in front of it.

51
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:35,980
- Do you want to do that as your reaction?

52
00:03:35,980 --> 00:03:39,100
- No. - No, dude.

53
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:50,240
I don't think it hits. It's a guy. It was a nine. So the dart sails overhead. Dogen misjudges

54
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:56,600
your height as you're a goblinoid and he loads up another dart to launch it again. Now it

55
00:03:56,600 --> 00:04:03,020
is the kitsune's turn. So two of them who started attacking you, Dogen and you, Evil

56
00:04:03,020 --> 00:04:08,240
Stevel, one of them hops on the head of the other one. A third one from behind climbs

57
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:13,960
up on top of the last one and they sort of start to balance themselves like a tall man

58
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:20,520
at the circus but then they all sort of laugh hysterically and just fall to the ground and

59
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:24,200
so I need all three of you to make dexterity saving throws.

60
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:25,200
I'm on it.

61
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:26,200
Okay.

62
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:27,200
I'm doing it right now.

63
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:28,200
14.

64
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:29,200
Uh-huh.

65
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:30,200
Uh, 5.

66
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:31,200
Not a saving throw.

67
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:32,200
Hold on.

68
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:33,200
19.

69
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:34,200
Oh wait, I didn't do that either.

70
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:35,400
Yeah, I'll let it go.

71
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:36,680
Yeah, let's let it happen.

72
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:37,680
Go for it.

73
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:44,800
19. Oh, man. Can I reroll too? No, you roll to save. I shouldn't have let you do it.

74
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:50,100
Yeah, so this thing comes crashing down. Patrick Yodar, I imagine you use your

75
00:04:50,100 --> 00:05:00,260
balls to bounce away. I'm just gonna hop over here. Okay. Evil, you are able to

76
00:05:00,260 --> 00:05:04,920
sidestep it nimbly. I don't know exactly what you do. You don't have balls. Cart

77
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:05,920
Cartwheel.

78
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:06,920
Cartwheel.

79
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:07,920
Okay.

80
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:08,920
I'll just write that down.

81
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:09,920
Cartwheel.

82
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:13,920
And you, uh, uh, Dogen, are distracted.

83
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:17,920
I also, I also try to bounce on my balls and that's why I get caught in it.

84
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:18,920
Okay.

85
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:24,920
So these kitsune's fall on you and they deal a staggering...

86
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:25,920
That's never good.

87
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:26,920
Wow.

88
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:28,920
I didn't, well, they did ten damage.

89
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:29,920
Jeez.

90
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:30,920
Ten?

91
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:31,920
Yeah.

92
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:33,920
With a zero at the end?

93
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:37,920
10 with another 0.

94
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:41,920
10 with... hold on, a thousand damage?

95
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:45,920
This isn't even fair, Patches.

96
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:49,920
I've taken 10 damage.

97
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:53,920
How much health do you have left?

98
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:57,920
I got a new healing spell that I learned, so I got you, dog.

99
00:05:57,920 --> 00:06:01,920
Actually, I didn't.

100
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:05,920
It is your turn, Dogen.

101
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:09,920
Okay, so are those kitsunes in range?

102
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:13,920
Yeah, so they're all, I should actually say, the side effect of that move

103
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:17,920
by them, because it deals a lot of damage, is that they all are knocked prone for the round.

104
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:21,920
Oh, okay. Because they all fell over.

105
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:25,920
So, one of them is in range of you, two of them are really in range of you, the third one's kind of a bit

106
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:29,920
far back. Yeah. Okay, hold on.

107
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:32,320
if two of them are in range

108
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:34,880
uh... well actually depends what you can do

109
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:36,160
i don't know yet

110
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:38,000
trying to figure it out

111
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:38,920
i guess

112
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:41,480
let's see uh... i guess i'll just

113
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:45,240
since i'm i'm i'm here right next to them i should probably just try to hit

114
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:46,960
them instead of like trying to

115
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:50,720
bless or no you know i i'm gonna get a blast out on my friends

116
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:53,640
over a blast and i bless myself as well

117
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:54,440
uh...

118
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:55,400
how shit

119
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:59,000
this is a says you bless up to three actors of your choice yes they can do

120
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:05,800
Okay, I bless I bless the three of us my three my three closest friends. It's me. Oh that feels terrible

121
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:07,280
Wow

122
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:09,460
So my foot hurts

123
00:07:09,460 --> 00:07:15,460
So all your while your foot hurts you are you do now have the ability to roll

124
00:07:15,460 --> 00:07:18,820
to add a d4 to any

125
00:07:18,820 --> 00:07:22,420
attack roll or saving throw so

126
00:07:24,260 --> 00:07:32,080
Yes, maybe your foot hurts, but it's pretty good. Yeah, I think my blessing is that I blow a kiss to

127
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:38,020
Have to accept it that was uh

128
00:07:38,020 --> 00:07:45,220
That I didn't like that some magical force compels me to accept the kiss. Yeah you giant

129
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:54,320
And you got another one for no reason if you look at my if you look at my right ball here

130
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:58,820
There's a there's a kiss print on it now. Yeah, I aimed there. I don't know why

131
00:07:58,820 --> 00:08:04,380
Cool is that all you want to do?

132
00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:07,860
Yeah, yeah, okay

133
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:11,500
Patrick Yodar you're up

134
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:14,960
How close am I to these guys again

135
00:08:15,460 --> 00:08:18,460
I don't know if I want to use bow and arrow or short sword.

136
00:08:18,460 --> 00:08:23,260
For sure. I would say you're in range of one of them because you dodge out of the way,

137
00:08:23,260 --> 00:08:27,060
probably not both of them. That's what I would say.

138
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:30,860
Yeah. Alright, so I'm just gonna swing my sword.

139
00:08:30,860 --> 00:08:32,660
Yeah, go for it.

140
00:08:32,660 --> 00:08:35,160
There's a crit one.

141
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:38,460
Oh my god. So, roll a d20.

142
00:08:38,460 --> 00:08:41,860
Okay, hold on. I'll do it in...

143
00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:44,260
I was about to do a custom roll in Beyond.

144
00:08:44,260 --> 00:08:45,260
custom rolls.

145
00:08:45,260 --> 00:08:46,260
Custom roll.

146
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:47,260
Okay, cool.

147
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:53,900
So you don't lose your weapon, but what does happen is you sort of, the sword's a little

148
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:57,380
bit long, so you kind of let the tip-- It's a short sword.

149
00:08:57,380 --> 00:09:00,500
Yeah, it's a rapier is what I'm reading here.

150
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:04,380
I just didn't know how to pronounce it correctly.

151
00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:06,900
Oh, okay.

152
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:10,260
So you just sort of like let it dangle a bit, you kind of just like scoop up a bit of the

153
00:09:10,260 --> 00:09:13,260
dirt and kind of-- Hey, Dogen, I got some stuff for you.

154
00:09:13,260 --> 00:09:41,620
and

155
00:09:41,620 --> 00:09:59,100
it's

156
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:00,380
It's just how my uncle taught me.

157
00:10:00,380 --> 00:10:01,380
I'm just doing it.

158
00:10:01,380 --> 00:10:02,380
Don't flank me.

159
00:10:02,380 --> 00:10:03,380
Watch this.

160
00:10:03,380 --> 00:10:04,380
He's not going to flank you.

161
00:10:04,380 --> 00:10:05,380
Oh, okay.

162
00:10:05,380 --> 00:10:06,380
I see what you're doing.

163
00:10:06,380 --> 00:10:07,940
Yeah, I'm actually not going to flank you at all.

164
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:08,940
Roll deception.

165
00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:09,940
Roll deception.

166
00:10:09,940 --> 00:10:10,940
20.

167
00:10:10,940 --> 00:10:11,940
Oh, okay.

168
00:10:11,940 --> 00:10:12,940
Yeah.

169
00:10:12,940 --> 00:10:13,940
All right.

170
00:10:13,940 --> 00:10:14,940
Yeah.

171
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:17,620
Yeah, don't look for me.

172
00:10:17,620 --> 00:10:18,620
I'm not going to.

173
00:10:18,620 --> 00:10:21,940
Yeah, you seem like a, you know, you just tried to stab me.

174
00:10:21,940 --> 00:10:23,460
You seem like a stand up guy.

175
00:10:23,460 --> 00:10:24,460
I am.

176
00:10:24,460 --> 00:10:25,460
I am.

177
00:10:25,460 --> 00:10:26,940
That is what people say about me.

178
00:10:26,940 --> 00:10:32,820
When he said his uncle taught him to flank, I got completely the wrong idea and I'm very

179
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:36,340
- I think it's something very wrong that his uncle did to him.

180
00:10:36,340 --> 00:10:37,980
Fanning your face.

181
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:44,780
Yeah, I'm quietly, "His uncle flanked him."

182
00:10:44,780 --> 00:10:46,780
It is now your turn, Evil Stevel.

183
00:10:46,780 --> 00:10:53,940
Okay, is there any water or lack thereof in 30 feet away?

184
00:10:53,940 --> 00:10:56,900
Probably not, right?

185
00:10:56,900 --> 00:11:03,940
Well here's the thing so like the key you're in the kitsune like civilization kind of like

186
00:11:03,940 --> 00:11:11,140
little hovel so there are like smaller crude tents that kind of line the place and like

187
00:11:11,140 --> 00:11:14,980
presumably some of them have some water inside of them because that's where some of the kitsune

188
00:11:14,980 --> 00:11:15,980
live.

189
00:11:15,980 --> 00:11:21,260
Um I can I can guarantee you that there's some water around.

190
00:11:21,260 --> 00:11:26,360
Are they... do they hate rain for some reason?

191
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:27,360
Or no?

192
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:29,520
I don't... not particularly.

193
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:30,520
Not that I know of.

194
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:31,520
ARGH!

195
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:32,520
Fuck.

196
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:37,400
Okay, then I will use...

197
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:39,000
I will use Inflict Wounds.

198
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:42,120
Well, no, there's not like a big bad guy right here.

199
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:46,040
I will use Guiding Bolt.

200
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:47,040
Hell yeah.

201
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:50,120
On the three guys stacked on top of each other.

202
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:52,120
Did they count as one guy?

203
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:53,840
No, they kind of fell apart.

204
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:55,840
So not quite right now.

205
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:58,040
Well, hold on, let me rethink this.

206
00:11:58,040 --> 00:11:59,340
Yeah, because there's a beast.

207
00:11:59,340 --> 00:12:00,340
There's a big beast.

208
00:12:00,340 --> 00:12:01,800
Oh, the beast.

209
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:04,980
Okay, I will use inflict wounds on the beast.

210
00:12:04,980 --> 00:12:08,400
So inflict wounds is a melee attack, so you have to run over it.

211
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:09,400
Pretty far away.

212
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:12,800
Yeah, then I will go back to guiding bolt.

213
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:16,520
Yeah, you're just like flipping through your spellbook.

214
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:18,520
a two page spellbook.

215
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:20,520
Back and forth.

216
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:22,520
Create and destroy water? No, there's no water here.

217
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:24,520
Alright.

218
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:26,520
I'm casting it.

219
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:28,520
Yeah, go for it.

220
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:30,520
Oh shit.

221
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:32,520
23, yeah that hits.

222
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:34,520
17 damage? Yeah baby.

223
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:36,520
So yeah, you see that beast and

224
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:38,520
you know, as D&D

225
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:40,520
combat goes, it's all

226
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:42,520
within the last 6 or so

227
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:44,520
seconds. So he's pointing

228
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:50,440
Dean or Luca at you and like going like your next kind of thing and as he's doing that you sort of

229
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:55,700
Shoot your fingers sort of raid in style and shoot out a like a radiant like bolt

230
00:12:55,700 --> 00:13:01,040
And that just like just gets him right between the eyes. Oh, is that why Raiden's called Raiden?

231
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:04,740
Cuz the radiant bolt now he has radiant bolts

232
00:13:04,740 --> 00:13:08,640
He has lightning, but I think I don't know down think that's why he's called Raiden

233
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:12,480
I think it's more probably maybe like a ray of lightning could be maybe something that oh

234
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:19,100
Because he raised he's reying them in he reigned in I feel like it's probably

235
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:29,280
It's gotta be a reference to something I think it's just a name probably no

236
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:35,520
Riding it's based on not pronounced. Ryjin is a thunder god in Japanese. Okay. Yeah, there you go

237
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:38,880
Yeah, it's just a Japanese name. Yeah, cuz

238
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:47,800
So yeah, the bolt stopped in midair during that and then it completed it

239
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:53,400
And yeah, you see the clown like

240
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:58,340
His nose honks the Sasquatch clown and he's like holding his forehead

241
00:13:58,340 --> 00:14:04,140
Yeah, you did a good amount of damage to him. He does not like that. Oh my gosh. You got the coolest idea

242
00:14:04,140 --> 00:14:07,800
So that's like lightning, right? Yeah. All right, cool

243
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:10,440
Does it do anything else?

244
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:13,440
Well, it's technically radiant damage, so it's not lightning.

245
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:15,440
It's not like electricity?

246
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:16,440
No, no.

247
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:17,440
That it could make me travel through water?

248
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:18,440
No, no, not quite.

249
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:19,440
AHH!

250
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:22,440
But, just because it's a radiant type of damage.

251
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:31,440
But, yes, what it also does is it means that you have advantage on that thing.

252
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:35,440
Anyone who has attack rolls on it has advantage until your next turn.

253
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:36,440
Nice.

254
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:37,440
to the end of your next round.

255
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:40,940
I have a thunder spell that I can prepare next time.

256
00:14:40,940 --> 00:14:41,940
We can team up.

257
00:14:41,940 --> 00:14:42,940
Water and thunder, dude.

258
00:14:42,940 --> 00:14:45,940
Well, thunder damage is different from lightning damage.

259
00:14:45,940 --> 00:14:48,940
Yeah, I know, but I was hoping I could get that by you.

260
00:14:48,940 --> 00:14:51,640
No, I'm a student of the elements.

261
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:54,440
You were drinking water, so I thought maybe you weren't listening.

262
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:55,940
No, I always listen.

263
00:14:55,940 --> 00:15:00,240
I listen twice as well with water, because it's like my mouth is...

264
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:04,740
So, uh, it is now the top of the order.

265
00:15:04,740 --> 00:15:13,240
And, um, 'cause I think I decided I wanted to leave Sullivan and the Prince at the White Woman of the Woods.

266
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:15,740
Just leave them there for a little bit.

267
00:15:15,740 --> 00:15:24,240
Um, and, uh, I need, um, let's see, who is up for this? Probably Dogen.

268
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:26,740
Dogen, I need you to roll a Dexterity saving throw.

269
00:15:26,740 --> 00:15:27,740
Me again?

270
00:15:27,740 --> 00:15:28,240
Yeah.

271
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:35,280
Oh brother 13. Wait. I can add I can add two fifty. Yeah.

272
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:41,200
You're good. so you see like from your left a giant flower

273
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:47,760
sort of slowly poke its head and it sort of rears back and

274
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:52,080
goes and shoots like a jet of water at you which you're able

275
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:55,760
to like pretty definitely get out of the way of that. Wow

276
00:15:55,760 --> 00:16:00,920
really Stievel you're not gonna destroy that water for me? I got away from my- I could

277
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:10,480
have been killed. He's gotta wait for his turn man. I'm in stasis right now, not supposed

278
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:22,520
to be talking to you! I blessed you. Shut up! You hurt my foot, you foot hurter. And

279
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:30,320
And then, uh, meanwhile this conversation's going on, um, uh, Patrick Yodar, roll a strength

280
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:31,320
saving throw.

281
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:33,320
Uh, this is my worst one.

282
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:34,320
Okay.

283
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:37,800
You add a d4.

284
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:38,800
It'll help.

285
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:42,200
You'll definitely beat it if you add a d4 to that.

286
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:43,200
Four.

287
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:44,960
Oh, wow, that's too bad.

288
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:45,960
So behind you...

289
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:46,960
How is that bad?

290
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:47,960
That's eight.

291
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:48,960
I...

292
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:49,960
That's not good enough.

293
00:16:49,960 --> 00:17:00,380
cool that you got a max on it. So behind you, Patrick Yodar, you feel suddenly two long

294
00:17:00,380 --> 00:17:08,880
hands, fox-like hands, clawing beneath your armpits, sort of grab you and swing you up,

295
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:15,200
and you realize that you're being, from a trapeze that has been set up between two trees,

296
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:21,560
being sent up into the air and caught by another kitsune. You can roll another strength saving

297
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:27,320
throw to see if you can wriggle out of it, though you might fall.

298
00:17:27,320 --> 00:17:31,960
It appears I've been hoisted. 17.

299
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:38,000
Okay yeah, you can wriggle out of this before they throw you again, and I'll have you roll

300
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:42,800
either athletics or acrobatics to see how you handle the fall.

301
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:48,800
Yeah, pretty good. So I'll say that you take, with that 14, I think you're able to sort of brace yourself a bit more.

302
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:54,800
You'll take half of this fall damage here. So you take 3 fall damage as they throw you up.

303
00:17:54,800 --> 00:18:00,800
That could keep going and going. They could have kept hoisting you up and up as a trapeze artist until they dropped you.

304
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:02,800
So that was good that you wriggled out of it.

305
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:06,800
That, uh, do not hoist me again. I'm gonna say that right now.

306
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:08,800
If I am hoisted, one more time.

307
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:11,860
one more really steve lear not gonna cast destroy hoist

308
00:18:11,860 --> 00:18:14,960
come on yeah i haven't learned that yet

309
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:18,280
you have i i i haven't read that far into my spell book

310
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:22,720
how many how many pages is in the spell book right now a hundred and thirty

311
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:25,960
how many pages have you got filled out

312
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:27,280
like to

313
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:28,140
god damn it

314
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:29,760
alright well you hate me

315
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:32,360
no i don't i'm not i'm just

316
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:34,920
and just i wish you were a little disappointed

317
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:40,120
Yeah, all right. Give me 18 seconds or so in game time and I'll definitely help out.

318
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:43,480
Yeah, I didn't want to say disappointed. That's what he said.

319
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:46,360
Hey, that's what he said.

320
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:50,840
So you gotta laugh in this life. I still got it. It's very short.

321
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:59,240
Patrick Yodar, you're like 40 feet further ahead of them. So you're just sort of yelling this, I guess, across

322
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:02,840
the field. I have one tone of voice.

323
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:07,860
Yeah, and you're closer to the carnage of the tent as well.

324
00:19:07,860 --> 00:19:09,560
So you can get a better look at what's going on.

325
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:11,860
Am I behind that guy still somehow?

326
00:19:11,860 --> 00:19:15,460
Maybe he moved with me.

327
00:19:15,460 --> 00:19:17,760
You're no longer flanking him.

328
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:18,260
Quite.

329
00:19:18,260 --> 00:19:20,160
Am I flanking somebody at least?

330
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:27,260
No, no, you're sort of like in this in-betweeny space where

331
00:19:27,260 --> 00:19:31,260
like Bussy Kitsune is like pretty close to you now.

332
00:19:31,260 --> 00:19:33,260
You kind of fell off at a good point.

333
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:37,560
like like 10 feet from you closer towards the guys.

334
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:39,360
So I'm close to bussy kitsune.

335
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:41,360
Okay, I'll keep that in mind.

336
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:45,560
Yeah, and then behind you about like 20 feet or so is the tent

337
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:48,960
itself where there's like all this like carnage and bloodshed

338
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:54,060
between animals and and kitsune's and kubler elves that are

339
00:19:54,060 --> 00:19:55,560
trying to hide and fear.

340
00:19:55,560 --> 00:20:00,660
But yeah, and so now that we're back to the top top of the

341
00:20:00,660 --> 00:20:02,760
order bussy kitsune's turn.

342
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:07,360
And he sees you Patrick Yodar and he whips his head around.

343
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:08,360
Hi!

344
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:09,360
Hey.

345
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:12,960
I'm gonna, I'm gonna try to kill you now.

346
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:13,960
Hello.

347
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:17,920
And uh, he shoots a uh, shoots another dart at you.

348
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:18,920
Mah Christ.

349
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:20,920
He loves to shoot those darts.

350
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:21,920
See how he does.

351
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:23,800
Nah, he just keeps whiffing.

352
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:30,360
Yeah, he just fuckin' like, like sucks it in a bit by accident and then like, and then

353
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:47,280
and

354
00:20:47,280 --> 00:21:02,000
get

355
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:12,000
And now it's the Kitsune's turn. And so they're all just gonna have to use Hafter movement to get up.

356
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:17,000
And the one in front of you, Dogen, is gonna try to swing at you with its staff.

357
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:23,000
And it just misses, or you're able to deflect it.

358
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:37,800
it

359
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:49,680
is

360
00:21:49,680 --> 00:22:01,960
is

361
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:24,960
I'm

362
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:28,080
I'm gonna save it. I don't think the beast is in range of me.

363
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:30,960
I don't want to run away. We have advantage on the beast.

364
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:34,360
I don't want to get an attack of opportunity on me by running away.

365
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:37,200
Mm-hmm. All right, cool.

366
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:40,120
So now it is your turn, Patrick Yodar.

367
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:43,440
And there's two people who are about to gang up on me.

368
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:45,440
Oh, yeah.

369
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:47,360
How close are they?

370
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:51,360
They are... Bussy sort of moved back. I should have said.

371
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:54,740
buses removed back five feet after they missed

372
00:22:54,740 --> 00:22:56,080
uh... decided

373
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:59,940
that he doesn't have a gender on all some uh... and uh...

374
00:22:59,940 --> 00:23:03,360
so and that thing is also the other key to news about also like about fifteen

375
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:04,460
feet from you

376
00:23:04,460 --> 00:23:05,560
and uh...

377
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:07,600
amateur i'm just gonna try and shoot 'em

378
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:10,360
yet i don't know an era

379
00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:12,360
twenty one pocketed hits

380
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:14,640

381
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:16,120
or maybe yeah

382
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:20,320
aptly so so i'd like i have the bow and arrow in my hand i'm looking at us in

383
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:28,000
I'm like, "Ned, you see, you're gonna wanna, you wanna look kinda, kinda close one eye."

384
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,000
So it's, you uh...

385
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,000
Yeah, yeah, okay.

386
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:33,080
Yeah, so you kinda close one eye so you can get like a better...

387
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:34,280
I see you doing that.

388
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:36,080
Yeah, better shot at your target.

389
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:37,080
Okay.

390
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:38,080
You gotta pick your target.

391
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:39,080
Right.

392
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:40,080
You gotta, I mean once you get your target...

393
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:41,080
Yeah, yeah.

394
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:46,960
Once you got your target picked out, you gotta, you just gotta, you gotta pray that it hits.

395
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:47,960
Okay.

396
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:48,960
And you kinda just...

397
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:49,960
Who do you pray to?

398
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:52,680
I just kind of let go and then I know what in particular

399
00:23:52,680 --> 00:24:02,480
And I do it like that shut up

400
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:06,000
Blood just coughing out blood

401
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:12,640
Thank you though, oh yeah, no problem. Yeah, and it is now

402
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:15,880
evil Steve'll stern

403
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:20,680
Ok, I think I may do Guiding Bolt on this beast again.

404
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:23,160
Hell yeah, you have advantage too.

405
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:25,960
True, alright, so I cast it twice, yeah?

406
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:28,040
Uh, yeah yeah yeah yeah.

407
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:29,040
Ok, the 13, shit.

408
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:31,040
Is that an attack roll?

409
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:32,040
Does it count?

410
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:34,080
That's the attack roll, yeah.

411
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:35,080
Can you add Bless to it?

412
00:24:35,080 --> 00:24:38,280
You can add Bless to it, yeah.

413
00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:42,000
So you can roll a d4, Evil Steevel.

414
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,600
Oh baby, yeah that hits.

415
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:45,600
That ate damage.

416
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:51,920
I love blessing my friends. Yeah. so yeah you you

417
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:57,680
**** shoot another guiding bolt at this thing and it sort of

418
00:24:57,680 --> 00:25:00,640
rears its head back again. You sort of knock it again while

419
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:05,040
it's fending off a bear and you see the bear sort of smile

420
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:09,120
gently at the while it's fighting it and this Sasquatch

421
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:12,880
is now completely like its sights are on you evil. It like

422
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:14,880
wants you next.

423
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:16,880
Bring it on.

424
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:18,880
Clown.

425
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:20,880
It honks darkly at you.

426
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:22,880
Nevermind, that was scary.

427
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:26,880
And we're back to the top of the order.

428
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:28,880
Bussy Kitsune is sort of like

429
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:30,880
in dire straits

430
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:32,880
and he sort of

431
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:34,880
throws the dart and the thing

432
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:36,880
and the...

433
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:38,880
what the f*** do you call that? Blow dart?

434
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:40,880
The blow dart, but what's the...

435
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:55,920
blow

436
00:25:55,920 --> 00:26:02,800
I think it's a shooter is what I would call it.

437
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:04,400
A blowgun, that's what it's called.

438
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:05,400
No way.

439
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:06,400
I was right!

440
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:07,400
Oh shit!

441
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:08,400
It is a gun!

442
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:09,400
It's definitely called a blowgun.

443
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:10,400
It's also called a blowpipe.

444
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:11,400
It's called a gun?

445
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:12,400
It's not a gun.

446
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:13,400
What a gun!

447
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:15,300
You can buy them on Amazon.

448
00:26:15,300 --> 00:26:16,300
Predator blowgun.

449
00:26:16,300 --> 00:26:17,300
36 inches.

450
00:26:17,300 --> 00:26:21,120
Yeah, you can buy the predator blowgun.

451
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:22,120
I think that's for your team.

452
00:26:22,120 --> 00:26:23,120
Yeah, I use it on predators.

453
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:24,120
God damn, he's too good.

454
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:26,120
God damn, he's too good.

455
00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:27,120
Yeah, shit.

456
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:28,120
He's too fucking good.

457
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:29,120
He's too fast.

458
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:31,120
That's what you get for being a predator.

459
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:32,120
Predators are fast.

460
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:34,120
These tactical blowguns are so cool.

461
00:26:34,120 --> 00:26:36,120
Can we get some of these?

462
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:37,120
Yeah, let's do it.

463
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:41,120
Are you going to make the purchase now or do you want me to...

464
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:48,120
So yeah, Bunseki Tsune throws down his tactical blowgun

465
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:52,120
and takes out a knife and just charges you, Patrick Jodar.

466
00:26:52,120 --> 00:27:11,940
a

467
00:27:11,940 --> 00:27:16,180
You take six damage as he sort of a he sort of throws on the blow dart and

468
00:27:16,180 --> 00:27:22,220
While clutching his chest with one hand sort of just kind of surprises you and gets you in the ribs with the knife

469
00:27:22,220 --> 00:27:28,620
And he says how's that for aim? And he's just a coughing up blood while he's saying yeah, that is not

470
00:27:28,620 --> 00:27:36,540
That is not what I taught you at all. Yeah, that is that that sucks. You teach me dick. I

471
00:27:36,540 --> 00:27:39,060
Taught you I taught you how to aim

472
00:27:39,900 --> 00:27:46,820
I'm actually I'm a very hurt right now. I'm actually it's not the the blade in my in my rib that hurts. It's actually the

473
00:27:46,820 --> 00:27:54,140
Just the disrespect your heart. Don't tell me you're disappointed in me. I'm very disappointed in

474
00:27:54,140 --> 00:28:01,160
And the kitsune behind him now is gonna also charge at you Patrick Jodar

475
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:06,380
He's gonna try to flank you so he's gonna get advantage. He's gonna run behind you. Oh

476
00:28:08,740 --> 00:28:11,140
What do I do you get hit?

477
00:28:11,140 --> 00:28:13,660
Why?

478
00:28:13,660 --> 00:28:16,080
No one's here to help me for

479
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:23,340
Nine damage. I'm dead. You're dead again. Yeah, I got you dude. Don't even trip. I got you even better

480
00:28:23,340 --> 00:28:28,540
I got you a million times better right now. Yeah bullshit. I have healing

481
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:30,260
Mm-hmm

482
00:28:30,260 --> 00:28:32,220
So yeah, he runs up behind you

483
00:28:32,220 --> 00:28:37,780
We'll get it flanking you getting advantage and just sort of bodies you with the staff until you just pass out

484
00:28:38,340 --> 00:28:40,980
uh... match

485
00:28:40,980 --> 00:28:42,300
you balls are up

486
00:28:42,300 --> 00:28:46,260
can you lie in your back your balls are just like when i think when i see that

487
00:28:46,260 --> 00:28:47,940
happen i'm like

488
00:28:47,940 --> 00:28:51,100
uh... that's what flanking is

489
00:28:51,100 --> 00:28:55,780
i don't have a lot of attention to my mother i'm ready to focus on the fight

490
00:28:55,780 --> 00:28:59,500
again and then you advantage on every attack now

491
00:28:59,500 --> 00:29:03,860
that that that you know i have really i don't mean that has been i don't know

492
00:29:03,860 --> 00:29:05,900
that means that that is that it

493
00:29:05,900 --> 00:29:07,220
i can't joke

494
00:29:07,220 --> 00:29:08,220
I can't joke around?

495
00:29:08,220 --> 00:29:10,220
With a DM you can't joke!

496
00:29:10,220 --> 00:29:11,220
*sneezes*

497
00:29:11,220 --> 00:29:14,220
Turn on the light.

498
00:29:14,220 --> 00:29:16,220
Um, okay.

499
00:29:16,220 --> 00:29:24,220
It is now the other two kitsune's turn, and they're going to just try to attack you,

500
00:29:24,220 --> 00:29:25,220
Dogen.

501
00:29:25,220 --> 00:29:27,220
I think they're just going to go back to back against you.

502
00:29:27,220 --> 00:29:31,220
Let's see how they do.

503
00:29:31,220 --> 00:29:32,220
Wow.

504
00:29:32,220 --> 00:29:35,220
They both hit you.

505
00:29:35,220 --> 00:29:39,040
I would hit them both from the back so they should keep that in mind. I

506
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:47,180
Will let them know they do nine damage to you in total. I'm dead also. Yeah, so they just fucking ko you

507
00:29:47,180 --> 00:29:51,980
Yeah, and so now

508
00:29:51,980 --> 00:29:54,300
evil Steve'll

509
00:29:54,300 --> 00:30:01,100
It's your turn. It's doh. Oh, I know again Dogen and Patrick Yoda our role death saving throws. Okay, I'm rolling custom

510
00:30:01,100 --> 00:30:03,100
*laughter*

511
00:30:03,100 --> 00:30:05,100
How do I do test saves?

512
00:30:05,100 --> 00:30:07,100
Oh here we go. Where is it?

513
00:30:07,100 --> 00:30:09,100
Oh, okay that's a success. Nice.

514
00:30:09,100 --> 00:30:11,100
Oh wait, okay. Top right, yeah.

515
00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:13,100
If you just click on the HP.

516
00:30:13,100 --> 00:30:15,100
I got a 10.

517
00:30:15,100 --> 00:30:17,100
That's a success. Or is it an 11?

518
00:30:17,100 --> 00:30:19,100
That's a success.

519
00:30:19,100 --> 00:30:21,100
You made an invisible roll.

520
00:30:21,100 --> 00:30:25,100
Oh you did a custom roll again.

521
00:30:25,100 --> 00:30:27,100
Yeah, 10 is a success.

522
00:30:27,100 --> 00:30:29,100
Awesome.

523
00:30:29,100 --> 00:30:43,020
the

524
00:30:43,020 --> 00:30:45,520
I thought you were just saying, "I'm doing a custom roll."

525
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:47,520
No, no, that's like, uh...

526
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:50,520
It throws a dice on your, um...

527
00:30:50,520 --> 00:30:53,020
Your... fuckin'...

528
00:30:53,020 --> 00:30:56,020
Your player... your player stats and stuff.

529
00:30:56,020 --> 00:30:57,520
Screen.

530
00:30:57,520 --> 00:31:00,520
No, it's not the screen.

531
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:04,020
It's the player sheet. It throws the die on there.

532
00:31:04,020 --> 00:31:06,020
Screen.

533
00:31:06,020 --> 00:31:07,520
You succeed!

534
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:08,520
You succeed, though.

535
00:31:08,520 --> 00:31:10,020
So, it's two successes.

536
00:31:10,020 --> 00:31:12,820
Now, Evil Stievel, it is your turn.

537
00:31:12,820 --> 00:31:20,620
Okay, I'm gonna use Spare the Dying on Dogen so that he can heal Patric.

538
00:31:20,620 --> 00:31:23,120
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

539
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:24,820
That doesn't bring me back, though.

540
00:31:24,820 --> 00:31:26,320
-Yeah, it just makes him stable. -It stabilizes you?

541
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:28,320
It does stabilize him, which is good.

542
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:29,620
What's the difference?

543
00:31:29,620 --> 00:31:33,220
Stabilizing just means he doesn't do death saving throws anymore.

544
00:31:33,220 --> 00:31:36,520
-Okay, I'm not gonna die, but I can't do anything. -So, if you wanted to...

545
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:38,720
Do I still have that cookie?

546
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:41,020
Uh, I think we all get cookies.

547
00:31:41,020 --> 00:31:43,020
Think Patrick has Patrick Patrick.

548
00:31:43,020 --> 00:31:45,820
Has can I rob him while he's down?

549
00:31:45,820 --> 00:31:47,320
Yeah, you certainly could.

550
00:31:47,320 --> 00:31:50,620
The other two went after Dogen, so you won't be provoking

551
00:31:50,620 --> 00:31:51,720
attack of opportunity.

552
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:54,520
You would have to run over there.

553
00:31:54,520 --> 00:31:58,420
You'd be able to run over there and then rob him.

554
00:31:58,420 --> 00:32:00,620
You might be able to yeah, you could feed him.

555
00:32:00,620 --> 00:32:02,920
I guess to just feed him and then get be later.

556
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:03,220
Okay.

557
00:32:03,220 --> 00:32:03,720
All right.

558
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:04,720
I run over there.

559
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:07,520
Feed Patrick his own cookie.

560
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:09,680
Yeah, what does that do for me?

561
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:12,220
You're full

562
00:32:12,220 --> 00:32:14,220
Roll 2d 4 plus 2

563
00:32:14,220 --> 00:32:17,020
Me or him

564
00:32:17,020 --> 00:32:21,360
Patrick that's how many hit points you get back. Okay six

565
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:23,940
nice

566
00:32:23,940 --> 00:32:28,000
All right, so you get six hit points back. So you're back you're back to life

567
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:35,760
Christ that how many did we have do we have another one left? You have one more cookie. Okay, you should bring it to me

568
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:42,200
Yeah, it's your turn. So it's my turn not yet. We're back to top of the order. It's bussy kitsune's turn again

569
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:47,200
Bussy kitsune is going to try to attack you evil steve-o

570
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:51,100
Okay, we'll definitely dodge it

571
00:32:51,100 --> 00:32:58,680
Yeah, you did. Well, let me double check your AC though before I say that that's crazy. They did that. Yeah, you got shit

572
00:32:58,680 --> 00:33:02,040
Yeah, Tracy tries to swing his knife for you and you dodge it pretty deftly

573
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:05,440
The other kitsune now is gonna try to get you

574
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:09,280
And

575
00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:11,200
Yeah, he whiffs

576
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:14,000
That keeps any just whiffs. He just did a really shitty roll

577
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:18,640
So you're just like fucking go over there shove a cookie in his mouth and just start dodging these guys

578
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:24,700
You're sort of you're a pro gamer right now for sure. Yeah, you're like ninja or dream

579
00:33:24,700 --> 00:33:27,680
Dream. Yeah. Oh

580
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:30,120
My god, yeah, dude

581
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:32,800
And

582
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:36,220
The other two key toonies are gonna run over there thinking Dogen's done

583
00:33:36,220 --> 00:33:40,440
So now they're sort of like this gang of them up on you guys

584
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:45,960
And back the top of the order Dogen roll death saving throw

585
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:50,060
Alright, that's a failure. Okay one success one failure

586
00:33:50,060 --> 00:33:55,280
Patrick Jodar you're up. I just I I run over

587
00:33:55,280 --> 00:33:58,240
to Dogen and I

588
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:01,200
I put the cookie under his nose.

589
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:01,700
[sniff]

590
00:34:01,700 --> 00:34:02,700
[laughter]

591
00:34:02,700 --> 00:34:04,200
I just instinctually go...

592
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:04,700
[smacking]

593
00:34:04,700 --> 00:34:05,700
[laughter]

594
00:34:05,700 --> 00:34:08,200
I eat it like one nibble at a time.

595
00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:10,700
Like an animation of a cookie disappearing.

596
00:34:10,700 --> 00:34:11,200
Yeah.

597
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:12,200
[laughter]

598
00:34:12,200 --> 00:34:13,200
Yeah, it's good.

599
00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:16,200
The nibble technique takes three rounds of combat to complete.

600
00:34:16,200 --> 00:34:17,200
[laughter]

601
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:19,200
Yeah, and it only heals me half as much.

602
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:19,700
Yeah.

603
00:34:19,700 --> 00:34:20,700
[laughter]

604
00:34:20,700 --> 00:34:22,700
There you go.

605
00:34:22,700 --> 00:34:23,700
Come on.

606
00:34:23,700 --> 00:34:25,200
Come on, eat it. Eat it normal.

607
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:27,200
Dogen just goes, "Mama!"

608
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:34,200
Yeah, I take one bite that's slightly larger than a nibble and instantly choke and die.

609
00:34:34,200 --> 00:34:35,200
Yeah.

610
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:40,200
Roll, roll, sorry.

611
00:34:40,200 --> 00:34:41,200
Roll 2d4+2.

612
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:49,440
Oh wait, did I add 2 to the, I had a 6.

613
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:50,520
I don't know, did you?

614
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:52,600
I didn't add 2, so I think I'm at...

615
00:34:52,600 --> 00:34:54,040
Oh yes, you didn't, okay.

616
00:34:54,040 --> 00:34:55,520
Alright, I healed 9.

617
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:57,520
Nice, okay, you're back up, Dogen.

618
00:34:57,520 --> 00:35:03,020
Evil Stievel, it is now your turn. You are sort of surrounded right now.

619
00:35:03,020 --> 00:35:05,520
Okay, the beast is nearby, yes?

620
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:09,520
The beast is nearby. The beast is not looking too good because of the damage you did to it.

621
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:13,020
Alright. I used Guiding Bolt last time, right?

622
00:35:13,020 --> 00:35:16,520
You used Guiding Bolt two turns ago, so it no longer has an advantage on it.

623
00:35:16,520 --> 00:35:18,520
Gotcha.

624
00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:20,520
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

625
00:35:20,520 --> 00:35:23,520
Okay, then I...

626
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:29,760
Is the beast close enough that I could touch him now?

627
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:34,080
You would have to provoke attack of opportunities if you ran over there, but he is close.

628
00:35:34,080 --> 00:35:41,680
Yeah, no, you kind of have like one kitsune on like one side of you in front and then

629
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:44,680
bussy on the other side of you in front.

630
00:35:44,680 --> 00:35:47,880
Tell me something about this create or destroy water.

631
00:35:47,880 --> 00:36:16,940
and

632
00:36:16,940 --> 00:36:22,660
bad call out I'll allow it yeah okay I create just a thicket I mean ten gallons

633
00:36:22,660 --> 00:36:28,300
of fog is quite a lot of fucking fog this shit is thick yeah and I I lay down

634
00:36:28,300 --> 00:36:38,020
some serious fog on these fools okay cool so yeah you know I try to I I grab

635
00:36:38,020 --> 00:36:44,820
wait Dogen is up yeah yeah Dogen's up over over in the back with

636
00:36:44,820 --> 00:36:57,140
a

637
00:36:57,140 --> 00:36:59,140
I just like shoot an arrow at BuzzyKitsune.

638
00:36:59,140 --> 00:37:01,140
Alright, I'm gonna say we use the fog to reposition.

639
00:37:01,140 --> 00:37:03,140
How many people are left? Real quick.

640
00:37:03,140 --> 00:37:05,140
So yeah, yeah.

641
00:37:05,140 --> 00:37:07,140
And can you tell us how bad they look?

642
00:37:07,140 --> 00:37:09,140
Yeah, yeah.

643
00:37:09,140 --> 00:37:11,140
So, you have,

644
00:37:11,140 --> 00:37:13,140
including the

645
00:37:13,140 --> 00:37:15,140
Sasquatch, it's

646
00:37:15,140 --> 00:37:17,140
five total.

647
00:37:17,140 --> 00:37:19,140
Two of them,

648
00:37:19,140 --> 00:37:21,140
BuzzyKitsune and one of the other

649
00:37:21,140 --> 00:37:23,140
Kitsunes look pretty bad.

650
00:37:23,140 --> 00:37:25,140
The other two

651
00:37:25,140 --> 00:37:42,020
to

652
00:37:42,020 --> 00:37:57,020
that

653
00:37:57,020 --> 00:38:01,580
I would prefer to be at 15.

654
00:38:01,580 --> 00:38:02,940
So what I want--

655
00:38:02,940 --> 00:38:03,860
yeah, sorry.

656
00:38:03,860 --> 00:38:04,940
I'll heal you to 15.

657
00:38:04,940 --> 00:38:05,580
I mean, do we--

658
00:38:05,580 --> 00:38:06,820
I don't know how long we have.

659
00:38:06,820 --> 00:38:07,860
Yeah, I was going to say--

660
00:38:07,860 --> 00:38:11,140
I was going to say, so what we can do is let's do stealth

661
00:38:11,140 --> 00:38:16,580
rolls in the fog, because you basically

662
00:38:16,580 --> 00:38:19,100
have this moment where you can move stealthily enough

663
00:38:19,100 --> 00:38:22,620
so you can get away from stuff and reposition.

664
00:38:22,620 --> 00:38:24,540
I don't know how often I should allow that,

665
00:38:24,540 --> 00:38:26,820
but I like this a lot.

666
00:38:26,820 --> 00:38:28,420
so I want you to try it.

667
00:38:28,420 --> 00:38:30,420
Wait, were you supposed to roll with advantage?

668
00:38:30,420 --> 00:38:31,420
No.

669
00:38:31,420 --> 00:38:33,020
I rolled with advantage automatically.

670
00:38:33,020 --> 00:38:34,020
Pick the first number.

671
00:38:34,020 --> 00:38:37,220
I did 13 then.

672
00:38:37,220 --> 00:38:38,220
Okay, cool.

673
00:38:38,220 --> 00:38:40,420
So I would say, yeah,

674
00:38:40,420 --> 00:38:42,820
Patrick and Dogen,

675
00:38:42,820 --> 00:38:44,220
you're already pretty far away,

676
00:38:44,220 --> 00:38:47,020
but you find a way to reposition sort of behind

677
00:38:47,020 --> 00:38:49,620
some of the, some of the tents,

678
00:38:49,620 --> 00:38:51,220
the smaller tents,

679
00:38:51,220 --> 00:38:53,220
and Brush that's around.

680
00:38:54,620 --> 00:38:56,620
And you see Busty and the other Kitsunis looking around.

681
00:38:56,620 --> 00:38:59,620
Um, uh, blah blah blah blah.

682
00:38:59,620 --> 00:39:04,120
Evil Stievel, um, you're able to peel away from them,

683
00:39:04,120 --> 00:39:06,620
so you don't provoke an attack of opportunity,

684
00:39:06,620 --> 00:39:09,120
but they still have a good idea of where your position is.

685
00:39:09,120 --> 00:39:13,620
Um, so, like, you're kind of, like, still near the big tent,

686
00:39:13,620 --> 00:39:19,120
but, um, you're away from them, um, like, 10 or 15 feet.

687
00:39:19,120 --> 00:39:22,120
Um, so that's, that's what I'll say.

688
00:39:22,120 --> 00:39:23,620
I think that's, that's fair enough.

689
00:39:23,620 --> 00:39:37,100
on

690
00:39:37,100 --> 00:39:52,100
is

691
00:39:52,100 --> 00:39:55,460
more. Okay, short rest.

692
00:39:55,460 --> 00:40:00,980
Back to the top of the order Bussy Kitsune is up Bussy

693
00:40:00,980 --> 00:40:06,900
Kitsune is going to try to come at you evil Steve but he does

694
00:40:06,900 --> 00:40:09,220
not have he's going to have disadvantage because of the

695
00:40:09,220 --> 00:40:14,500
fog. so I like that kind of thinking let me give you okay

696
00:40:14,500 --> 00:40:17,300
and yeah, he just **** with he comes at you with a knife and

697
00:40:17,300 --> 00:40:20,340
for you. It's like it's like he's swinging in front of you.

698
00:40:20,340 --> 00:40:39,700
a

699
00:40:39,700 --> 00:40:42,900
So let's see how they do. I'll give them like one roll for all of them.

700
00:40:42,900 --> 00:40:45,900
But they got a really good roll.

701
00:40:45,900 --> 00:40:48,200
So they...

702
00:40:48,200 --> 00:40:50,600
Why are you laughing? That's not funny.

703
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:52,600
Because it's inappropriate.

704
00:40:52,600 --> 00:40:54,600
As the DM you shouldn't be taking sides.

705
00:40:54,600 --> 00:40:57,600
I'm not taking sides in the battle.

706
00:40:57,600 --> 00:41:01,600
It's interesting. That's why I'm laughing at how interesting it is.

707
00:41:01,600 --> 00:41:02,600
Yeah, okay.

708
00:41:02,600 --> 00:41:05,600
I'm very interested in roleplay.

709
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:07,600
Crypto jester.

710
00:41:07,600 --> 00:41:14,080
Yeah, yeah, no, no, I'm not the jester I would never do that. I would never joke like that

711
00:41:14,080 --> 00:41:19,740
But yeah, they find you they sort of a fan out and they kind of catch where you guys are

712
00:41:19,740 --> 00:41:23,000
But that's that's what they do for their turn is look and find you

713
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:27,240
And you caught me

714
00:41:27,240 --> 00:41:31,200
Rats it sucks and

715
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:35,320
It is now

716
00:41:36,120 --> 00:41:37,120
Dogen's turn.

717
00:41:37,120 --> 00:41:38,120
Okay.

718
00:41:38,120 --> 00:41:39,120
They found us?

719
00:41:39,120 --> 00:41:40,120
Mm-hmm.

720
00:41:40,120 --> 00:41:43,120
But they're like, they're like 15 feet, each of them.

721
00:41:43,120 --> 00:41:44,120
All right.

722
00:41:44,120 --> 00:41:49,120
Well, how much HP are you missing, total?

723
00:41:49,120 --> 00:41:50,120
Me?

724
00:41:50,120 --> 00:41:51,120
Yeah.

725
00:41:51,120 --> 00:41:54,120
I am missing seven.

726
00:41:54,120 --> 00:41:55,120
Okay.

727
00:41:55,120 --> 00:42:02,120
I guess I will, I'll heal you for seven with my Lay on Hands.

728
00:42:02,120 --> 00:42:03,120
Okay.

729
00:42:03,120 --> 00:42:04,120
Mm-hmm.

730
00:42:04,120 --> 00:42:10,920
Okay. Um, and I don't necessarily want to be like in front of him

731
00:42:10,920 --> 00:42:15,080
because I have less help him at this point, but I think I'll move at least next to like,

732
00:42:15,080 --> 00:42:20,040
I don't, I want to make it like, so they will spread out their attacks maybe.

733
00:42:20,040 --> 00:42:22,520
Yeah. Some way through the positioning.

734
00:42:22,520 --> 00:42:24,600
Yeah. So you can, maybe you move like 10 feet, like.

735
00:42:24,600 --> 00:42:28,200
So they can't, they can't all just like swarm one.

736
00:42:28,200 --> 00:42:32,760
Yeah, for sure. Okay. So you sort of reposition there. Okay, cool. Uh, Pat,

737
00:42:32,760 --> 00:42:34,920
No, yeah, yes, Patrick, it's your turn.

738
00:42:34,920 --> 00:42:39,080
So there's somebody in front of me now, basically.

739
00:42:39,080 --> 00:42:44,640
There's like a three of them are like sort of like in front of you kind of also like kind of like sort of fanned out from one another.

740
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:49,720
You could see the one that's like more gravely injured also pretty clearly.

741
00:42:49,720 --> 00:42:52,480
So you know which one's the one that is injured.

742
00:42:52,720 --> 00:42:56,020
Is there any way that I could

743
00:42:56,020 --> 00:43:00,820
use the wind?

744
00:43:00,820 --> 00:43:03,660
To shoot an arrow through all three of them,

745
00:43:03,660 --> 00:43:07,060
that is crazy pants.

746
00:43:07,060 --> 00:43:08,760
No, sir.

747
00:43:08,760 --> 00:43:12,660
OK, can I shoot?

748
00:43:12,660 --> 00:43:14,880
Can I use the wind to shoot two of them?

749
00:43:20,660 --> 00:43:24,660
No, no, no, not gonna lie this time.

750
00:43:24,660 --> 00:43:28,660
What about one?

751
00:43:28,660 --> 00:43:32,660
How close is the gravely injured one to me?

752
00:43:32,660 --> 00:43:36,660
Between 10 and 15 feet from you.

753
00:43:36,660 --> 00:43:40,660
Okay, I am just gonna like stab him.

754
00:43:40,660 --> 00:43:44,660
Go for it.

755
00:43:44,660 --> 00:43:48,660
24. Yeah that hits, roll for damage.

756
00:43:48,660 --> 00:43:50,660
Describe your kill, brother.

757
00:43:50,660 --> 00:43:52,660
I just throw the dagger.

758
00:43:52,660 --> 00:43:54,660
I'm like, "Ah, you caught me, crap."

759
00:43:54,660 --> 00:43:56,660
And I just throw the dagger.

760
00:43:56,660 --> 00:43:58,660
It hits him right in the forehead.

761
00:43:58,660 --> 00:44:00,660
I'm like,

762
00:44:00,660 --> 00:44:02,660
"It's my bad, I'm sorry."

763
00:44:02,660 --> 00:44:06,660
"I'm gonna need that back."

764
00:44:06,660 --> 00:44:08,660
And I go over and I pull the dagger.

765
00:44:08,660 --> 00:44:10,660
Like, I have to, like...

766
00:44:10,660 --> 00:44:12,660
Use your full movement to pull, go over, pull the dagger out.

767
00:44:12,660 --> 00:44:16,660
It's like, like, to the hilt.

768
00:44:16,660 --> 00:44:33,780
the

769
00:44:33,780 --> 00:44:40,780
You guys, yeah, I'm gonna need help with this.

770
00:44:40,780 --> 00:44:44,780
Okay, okay, alright. On three? On three? Or one, two, three, and then we do it?

771
00:44:44,780 --> 00:44:47,780
Yeah, one, two, three, then we pull. Okay.

772
00:44:47,780 --> 00:44:48,780
Alright.

773
00:44:48,780 --> 00:44:51,780
Alright, one, two, three.

774
00:44:51,780 --> 00:44:53,780
Yeah, there we go.

775
00:44:53,780 --> 00:44:55,780
You said on three.

776
00:44:55,780 --> 00:44:57,780
Well, I got it out anyway.

777
00:44:57,780 --> 00:44:58,780
Okay.

778
00:44:58,780 --> 00:45:00,780
Can I just attack one of them now?

779
00:45:00,780 --> 00:45:06,780
I'll let you do it with disadvantage because it's funny.

780
00:45:06,780 --> 00:45:07,780
Go for it.

781
00:45:07,780 --> 00:45:09,780
Alright, then I just swing.

782
00:45:09,780 --> 00:45:10,780
Oh fuck off!

783
00:45:10,780 --> 00:45:11,780
Oh my god!

784
00:45:11,780 --> 00:45:12,780
19!

785
00:45:12,780 --> 00:45:13,780
God damn it!

786
00:45:13,780 --> 00:45:16,780
I think that hits there, Mr. Dungeon Master.

787
00:45:16,780 --> 00:45:17,780
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

788
00:45:17,780 --> 00:45:20,780
Roll for damage, roll for damage.

789
00:45:20,780 --> 00:45:21,780
7.

790
00:45:21,780 --> 00:45:22,780
Hell yeah.

791
00:45:22,780 --> 00:45:23,780
Yeah, you fucking-

792
00:45:23,780 --> 00:45:24,780
And it's a sneak attack.

793
00:45:24,780 --> 00:45:26,780
We can add that too, maybe.

794
00:45:26,780 --> 00:45:27,780
No, fuck that shit.

795
00:45:27,780 --> 00:45:30,780
You cut him the fuck up though.

796
00:45:30,780 --> 00:45:36,780
I just like, I cut at his throat, but I think maybe I miss and I like get under towards the chest.

797
00:45:36,780 --> 00:45:38,780
Yeah, but it's a deep gash.

798
00:45:38,780 --> 00:45:39,780
Yeah.

799
00:45:39,780 --> 00:45:41,780
He is not like, he's like, "FUCK!"

800
00:45:41,780 --> 00:45:43,780
Like just, "UGH!"

801
00:45:43,780 --> 00:45:45,780
I'm a...

802
00:45:45,780 --> 00:45:47,780
You guys work for a trickster.

803
00:45:47,780 --> 00:45:50,780
Hey, you guys have to help him pull that one out too.

804
00:45:50,780 --> 00:45:52,780
Get real close to him.

805
00:45:55,780 --> 00:45:58,260
And it is now evil Steve's turn

806
00:45:58,260 --> 00:46:05,340
Okay, am I close to the to the beast now? Yeah, you're close to the beast. You're pretty close

807
00:46:05,340 --> 00:46:07,640
All right, and he's aware of where I am though

808
00:46:07,640 --> 00:46:14,820
Because of the fog and everything else going on around him. You know, excuse me less aware. All right

809
00:46:14,820 --> 00:46:21,900
I'm I'm in I'm inflicting wounds on this motherfucker. Okay, cool. Yeah, I'll say that like bussy kitsune miss so wide

810
00:46:21,900 --> 00:46:23,900
You can just sort of sides of that. Yeah. Oh

811
00:46:24,540 --> 00:46:27,340
I don't know what role you have to roll bless to see if you can get that.

812
00:46:27,340 --> 00:46:30,040
I shouldn't say that, but yeah, it's a d4, right?

813
00:46:30,040 --> 00:46:31,940
Mm-hmm.

814
00:46:31,940 --> 00:46:33,840
Yeah, that hits.

815
00:46:33,840 --> 00:46:35,740
Yeah, you you let's go.

816
00:46:35,740 --> 00:46:37,840
You kill this beast.

817
00:46:37,840 --> 00:46:40,540
Let's go do you fucking stupid ass beast?

818
00:46:40,540 --> 00:46:45,340
Yeah, fuck you as you as you inflict wounds,

819
00:46:45,340 --> 00:46:46,940
which what does that do for you?

820
00:46:46,940 --> 00:46:49,440
You want to describe it?

821
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:52,640
Turn somebody inside out starting from their penis.

822
00:46:52,640 --> 00:46:54,840
Turns all their skin completely inside out.

823
00:46:54,840 --> 00:46:57,940
So the rule I'm going to let Wizards of the Coast know,

824
00:46:57,940 --> 00:46:59,440
but they should update the text.

825
00:46:59,440 --> 00:47:00,740
Yeah, there's not anything.

826
00:47:00,740 --> 00:47:02,940
There's nothing descriptive in that that's I know.

827
00:47:02,940 --> 00:47:05,440
It's literally just like make them do the damage.

828
00:47:05,440 --> 00:47:09,040
Yeah, so tell them listen, but we had this idea they can turn

829
00:47:09,040 --> 00:47:10,440
inside out from their penis.

830
00:47:10,440 --> 00:47:14,240
Yeah, you know the guy who wrote each shit on his head or

831
00:47:14,240 --> 00:47:14,840
whatever.

832
00:47:14,840 --> 00:47:16,140
Yeah, he has an idea.

833
00:47:16,140 --> 00:47:18,940
That's right.

834
00:47:18,940 --> 00:47:19,140
Better.

835
00:47:19,140 --> 00:47:20,240
Yeah.

836
00:47:20,240 --> 00:47:30,480
So anyway, so, uh, yeah, and as you do, you see the beast, you see the slight flicker of life in this beast that isn't possessed by rage.

837
00:47:30,480 --> 00:47:32,480
Don't care, fuck you!

838
00:47:32,480 --> 00:47:37,200
[Laughter]

839
00:47:37,200 --> 00:47:42,160
Fuckin' die, stupid-ass, bitch-ass beast, fuck you!

840
00:47:42,160 --> 00:47:46,320
A thought bubble comes up from its head and it's just like a broken heart.

841
00:47:46,320 --> 00:47:50,720
I close my eyes so I don't see it.

842
00:47:50,720 --> 00:47:55,920
Just fucking die already, you stupid ass bitch ass beast.

843
00:47:55,920 --> 00:47:56,920
Yeah.

844
00:47:56,920 --> 00:48:05,160
So yeah, you just yelling at this thing as it turns inside out from the penis.

845
00:48:05,160 --> 00:48:14,300
And you see a slight wisp of something leave its skull as it falls to the ground dead.

846
00:48:14,300 --> 00:48:15,900
I grabbed the thing that left its skull.

847
00:48:15,900 --> 00:48:17,200
It's gone.

848
00:48:17,200 --> 00:48:18,500
God damn it.

849
00:48:18,500 --> 00:48:18,800
All right.

850
00:48:18,800 --> 00:48:22,500
I try to shoot it with an arrow out of the set of the air.

851
00:48:22,500 --> 00:48:23,300
You have it.

852
00:48:23,300 --> 00:48:24,500
You have a bow and arrow, right?

853
00:48:24,500 --> 00:48:25,000
I think you do.

854
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:25,900
Yeah, I don't know.

855
00:48:25,900 --> 00:48:29,200
All right, maybe I grab you have a crossbow.

856
00:48:29,200 --> 00:48:29,400
All right.

857
00:48:29,400 --> 00:48:32,400
Yeah, I use my crossbow to try to kill his soul before it

858
00:48:32,400 --> 00:48:32,900
gets any.

859
00:48:32,900 --> 00:48:33,200
Yeah.

860
00:48:33,200 --> 00:48:34,300
Yeah.

861
00:48:34,300 --> 00:48:38,800
And yeah, you killed the beast.

862
00:48:38,800 --> 00:48:40,200
That's pretty good round.

863
00:48:40,200 --> 00:48:44,200
I would say we're back to the top of the order and you

864
00:48:44,200 --> 00:48:49,200
Busty Kitsune now is pretty furious.

865
00:48:49,200 --> 00:48:53,040
And he's gonna take out his blowgart.

866
00:48:53,040 --> 00:48:53,880
- Blowgart?

867
00:48:53,880 --> 00:48:54,720
(laughing)

868
00:48:54,720 --> 00:48:56,160
- I'm gonna take, I'm sorry.

869
00:48:56,160 --> 00:48:59,200
He's gonna take out his fucking blowgart.

870
00:48:59,200 --> 00:49:01,200
- What the heck is that thing you just took out?

871
00:49:01,200 --> 00:49:02,880
Is that a blowgart?

872
00:49:02,880 --> 00:49:05,000
- I've heard of these.

873
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:06,240
They're called blowgart.

874
00:49:06,240 --> 00:49:07,720
- Oh, if only someone could--

875
00:49:07,720 --> 00:49:08,560
- In real life.

876
00:49:08,560 --> 00:49:09,380
- Guys, look out.

877
00:49:09,380 --> 00:49:10,480
He's got a blowgart.

878
00:49:10,480 --> 00:49:11,320
I've heard it.

879
00:49:11,320 --> 00:49:14,520
Can somebody describe what this blowgart looks like?

880
00:49:14,520 --> 00:49:15,520
What's a blowgart?

881
00:49:15,520 --> 00:49:18,400
Oh, what are you ta- Everybody knows what a blowgart is.

882
00:49:18,400 --> 00:49:19,400
Oh yeah?

883
00:49:19,400 --> 00:49:20,400
He's got it up to his mouth.

884
00:49:20,400 --> 00:49:21,400
He's blowgarting the thing.

885
00:49:21,400 --> 00:49:22,400
Just about the most common thing in the world.

886
00:49:22,400 --> 00:49:23,400
He's blowgarting the thing.

887
00:49:23,400 --> 00:49:24,400
He's blowgarting the thing.

888
00:49:24,400 --> 00:49:25,400
He won't share it with anybody.

889
00:49:25,400 --> 00:49:31,160
That's one thing that your elders will always tell you, is never blowgart the thing.

890
00:49:31,160 --> 00:49:36,120
That's a fantastic four.

891
00:49:36,120 --> 00:49:39,520
Yeah, and he misses with his blowgart.

892
00:49:39,520 --> 00:49:41,520
*laughter*

893
00:49:41,520 --> 00:49:43,520
*overlapping*

894
00:49:43,520 --> 00:49:45,520
*laughter*

895
00:49:45,520 --> 00:49:47,520
*overlapping*

896
00:49:47,520 --> 00:49:49,520
*laughter*

897
00:49:49,520 --> 00:49:51,520
*overlapping*

898
00:49:51,520 --> 00:49:53,520
*overlapping*

899
00:49:53,520 --> 00:49:55,520
*overlapping*

900
00:49:55,520 --> 00:49:57,520
*overlapping*

901
00:49:57,520 --> 00:49:59,520
*overlapping*

902
00:49:59,520 --> 00:50:01,520
*overlapping*

903
00:50:01,520 --> 00:50:03,520
*overlapping*

904
00:50:03,520 --> 00:50:05,520
*overlapping*

905
00:50:05,520 --> 00:50:07,520
*overlapping*

906
00:50:07,520 --> 00:50:12,840
And it is now the other two kitsune's who are still alive

907
00:50:12,840 --> 00:50:17,180
One of them is gravely injured. He's gonna try to swing at you Patrick

908
00:50:17,180 --> 00:50:19,160
I

909
00:50:19,160 --> 00:50:21,360
See him about the swing. He don't

910
00:50:21,360 --> 00:50:25,160
Point my finger at the cut in his chest

911
00:50:25,160 --> 00:50:32,680
Don't you stops for like half a second like and then just like goes for it, but he really considers it

912
00:50:32,680 --> 00:50:35,760
Okay

913
00:50:36,560 --> 00:50:38,560
That's gonna be a hit

914
00:50:38,560 --> 00:50:41,960
It might not kill you

915
00:50:41,960 --> 00:50:49,360
God damn they're getting such good rolls though. What do you do? What's a damage? I'm dead. No, I healed you. Oh, yeah

916
00:50:49,360 --> 00:50:52,500
Yeah, fuck you. You're full health. Yeah

917
00:50:52,500 --> 00:50:55,160
I'm never healing you again

918
00:50:55,160 --> 00:51:01,760
No, I just forgot to you just want sympathy. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Well now I'm at eight you're acting out for attention

919
00:51:01,880 --> 00:51:05,560
so now the it was pointless for me to change it in my hit points because i was

920
00:51:05,560 --> 00:51:07,840
just gonna go back to anyway

921
00:51:07,840 --> 00:51:11,320
the other one's gonna try to attack you in a missus though nine because your

922
00:51:11,320 --> 00:51:13,840
left ball which is much more nimble than your right

923
00:51:13,840 --> 00:51:16,920
has been brutalized during this fight

924
00:51:16,920 --> 00:51:18,040
uh...

925
00:51:18,040 --> 00:51:19,600
and uh...

926
00:51:19,600 --> 00:51:21,580

927
00:51:21,580 --> 00:51:22,680
okay so there's

928
00:51:22,680 --> 00:51:24,280

940
00:51:51,240 --> 00:51:52,020

00:51:52,020 --> 00:51:56,040
i hate like another like i'm gradually going down his body so it's just like

943
00:51:57,280 --> 00:52:02,740
All right, and then the shoulder and then yeah, and then he's just all bruised and fucked up and then yes

944
00:52:02,740 --> 00:52:07,080
And then he goes flying on the last way disappears in the sky with a star like Team Rocket and everyone cheers

945
00:52:07,080 --> 00:52:10,520
And then they put a medal around my neck. Okay. Yeah, and then

946
00:52:10,520 --> 00:52:13,120
right you cure cancer and

947
00:52:13,120 --> 00:52:15,800
What's cancer?

948
00:52:15,800 --> 00:52:19,880
Fantasy, there's no cancer. It's a young thug song. That's cancer

949
00:52:22,200 --> 00:52:28,640
Yeah, it hasn't been invented yet. You just destroy that by the government's you just kill him evil steve will invent cancer

950
00:52:28,640 --> 00:52:36,680
Evil steve-o will invent cancer during this campaign. I have it my way. Yeah, let's do it

951
00:52:36,680 --> 00:52:41,240
So yeah, you just brutalized bussy kitsune and he falls to the ground

952
00:52:41,240 --> 00:52:47,280
He's crumpled and as a kitsune see their leader fall and the beasts fall and the animals just coming in and just

953
00:52:47,440 --> 00:52:52,080
fucking up the rest of them. You see one of the bears starting to pick the lock of one of the

954
00:52:52,080 --> 00:53:01,440
kubler elves. It's pandemonium. The other two kitsunes sort of try to run at this point. They're

955
00:53:01,440 --> 00:53:09,520
completely demoralized. Can I do like a... You absolutely can. I'll go for them. I pull out my

956
00:53:09,520 --> 00:53:23,360
the

957
00:53:23,360 --> 00:53:25,360
Can they run in a single file line?

958
00:53:25,360 --> 00:53:27,080
Uh, hold on.

959
00:53:27,080 --> 00:53:28,320
I snapped my fingers.

960
00:53:28,320 --> 00:53:29,320
Yeah, it just happened.

961
00:53:29,320 --> 00:53:30,320
Okay.

962
00:53:30,320 --> 00:53:32,400
They're in a single file line, what do you want to do?

963
00:53:32,400 --> 00:53:33,400
I'm going to shoot them.

964
00:53:33,400 --> 00:53:35,920
I'm going to shoot the one in the back through the neck.

965
00:53:35,920 --> 00:53:36,920
Okay.

966
00:53:36,920 --> 00:53:40,760
And I'm going to hope that it goes through, I'm going to, like a double tracheotomy.

967
00:53:40,760 --> 00:53:41,760
Hell yeah.

968
00:53:41,760 --> 00:53:42,760
If this works.

969
00:53:42,760 --> 00:53:44,560
I love that cannibal corpse song.

970
00:53:44,560 --> 00:53:45,920
Double tracheotomy.

971
00:53:45,920 --> 00:53:51,200
If this works, I will be the greatest marksman of all time.

972
00:53:51,200 --> 00:53:52,320
Oh yeah.

973
00:53:52,320 --> 00:53:53,320
There's no doubt.

974
00:53:53,320 --> 00:53:54,320
Fifteen.

975
00:53:54,320 --> 00:53:55,320
That hits.

976
00:53:55,320 --> 00:53:56,320
Yeah.

977
00:53:56,320 --> 00:53:57,320
Does it hit both?

978
00:53:57,320 --> 00:53:58,320
Uh, yeah.

979
00:53:58,320 --> 00:54:00,000
I think it fucking does.

980
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:01,560
Like, why the fuck not?

981
00:54:01,560 --> 00:54:04,560
I was gonna say you had every right to just give me one.

982
00:54:04,560 --> 00:54:05,560
Nah.

983
00:54:05,560 --> 00:54:09,040
I had every right to give you one a long time ago, man.

984
00:54:09,040 --> 00:54:10,720
I don't believe in those rights anymore.

985
00:54:10,720 --> 00:54:12,920
So I just hit both of those kitsune's.

986
00:54:12,920 --> 00:54:13,920
Fuck yeah.

987
00:54:13,920 --> 00:54:14,920
The other one doesn't die.

988
00:54:14,920 --> 00:54:15,920
The other one just has like an arrow in its neck.

989
00:54:15,920 --> 00:54:16,920
Yeah, he's got one on the back.

990
00:54:16,920 --> 00:54:17,920
It's still attached to him.

991
00:54:17,920 --> 00:54:18,920
It's stuck.

992
00:54:18,920 --> 00:54:19,920
Yeah, I just pinned him to him.

993
00:54:19,920 --> 00:54:21,920
I just pinned him to him.

994
00:54:21,920 --> 00:54:23,920
It's like, you're gonna be slow now.

995
00:54:23,920 --> 00:54:25,920
Not what I wanted, but...

996
00:54:25,920 --> 00:54:27,920
He's just like crying and laughing.

997
00:54:27,920 --> 00:54:29,920
He's just freaking out.

998
00:54:29,920 --> 00:54:31,920
Having an episode.

999
00:54:31,920 --> 00:54:33,920
The permanent piggyback.

1000
00:54:33,920 --> 00:54:35,920
I've heard of that technique.

1001
00:54:35,920 --> 00:54:37,920
That's very impressive.

1002
00:54:37,920 --> 00:54:39,920
That was a good one, Patrick.

1003
00:54:39,920 --> 00:54:41,920
Yeah, that is exactly what I was trying to do, too.

1004
00:54:41,920 --> 00:54:43,920
Don't let anyone tell you

1005
00:54:43,920 --> 00:54:45,920
that's not what I was trying to do.

1006
00:54:45,920 --> 00:54:47,920
Mm-hmm.

1007
00:54:47,920 --> 00:54:51,920
I won't let anybody tell me that.

1008
00:54:51,920 --> 00:54:53,920
Cool, I mean, like, yeah.

1009
00:54:53,920 --> 00:54:57,920
Don't let any kind of voices on the outside...

1010
00:54:57,920 --> 00:55:02,920
Another kid comes over and taps me on the shoulder and I say, "No!"

1011
00:55:02,920 --> 00:55:07,920
Can I attack that one?

1012
00:55:07,920 --> 00:55:11,920
And the fight slowly ends.

1013
00:55:11,920 --> 00:55:14,920
Yeah, I mean, you guys won, as far as I'm concerned.

1014
00:55:14,920 --> 00:55:20,120
Like they're there that I didn't want to have to play that out. You guys sort of would have beaten the shit out of them

1015
00:55:20,120 --> 00:55:22,240
nice

1016
00:55:22,240 --> 00:55:25,480
And yeah, the coobler elves are freed

1017
00:55:25,480 --> 00:55:31,680
You see everybody is like pretty bruised and battered from the fight, but they're pretty happy

1018
00:55:31,680 --> 00:55:40,060
With everything that's happened. You see the coop coobler elves come over to you and they're like, thank you so much for freeing us

1019
00:55:40,060 --> 00:55:44,040
Thank you. We I don't know how we can ever repay you

1020
00:55:44,040 --> 00:55:59,020
to

1021
00:55:59,020 --> 00:56:06,260
excuse me the tent and they get out 500 gold pieces that the kitsune stole from

1022
00:56:06,260 --> 00:56:10,940
the kooblers and robbed from people who came into the woods they also bring back

1023
00:56:10,940 --> 00:56:17,380

investigation and all rule investigation. Yeah, sure.

1027
00:56:39,640 --> 00:56:44,140
9-5 goddammit. So yeah, you guys sort of explore the compound

1028
00:56:44,140 --> 00:56:49,640
you see sort of scattered debris from from travelers who went

1029
00:56:49,640 --> 00:56:53,840
through the woods and were attacked by the kitsune's you

1030
00:56:53,840 --> 00:57:00,840
see Jack in the boxes. You see other clown where clown where

1031
00:57:00,840 --> 00:57:04,540
it's I like to call it. You also see like scarves tied together

1032
00:57:04,540 --> 00:57:07,140
that seemed to be what was holding the Sasquatch

1033
00:57:07,140 --> 00:57:08,500
when they were captured it.

1034
00:57:08,500 --> 00:57:13,340
And you also see a Dean and Luca Vegas,

1035
00:57:13,340 --> 00:57:16,460
the brothers who were used as battering rams

1036
00:57:16,460 --> 00:57:19,860
or used as weapons by the Sasquatch and are fully dead.

1037
00:57:19,860 --> 00:57:22,980
- Man, I was gonna kill them.

1038
00:57:22,980 --> 00:57:24,940
(laughing)

1039
00:57:24,940 --> 00:57:29,580
- Yeah, they're fully dead just like in the tent.

1040
00:57:29,580 --> 00:57:32,020
You don't really find too much else in there.

1041
00:57:33,060 --> 00:57:39,560
Besides, I mean the 500 gold pieces, which was the coobler sort of scrounging around getting up all the money that they could get for you guys in there.

1042
00:57:39,560 --> 00:57:43,960
You see one coobler Elf sort of go up to you guys and go.

1043
00:57:43,960 --> 00:57:53,160
We're going to head back to the to the to the the woman and the white woman in the woods pond and we're going to have a big party.

1044
00:57:53,160 --> 00:57:56,360
If you guys want to join a party.

1045
00:57:56,360 --> 00:57:57,260
Wow.

1046
00:57:57,260 --> 00:57:57,560
Yeah.

1047
00:57:57,560 --> 00:57:58,060
Yeah.

1048
00:57:58,060 --> 00:57:59,860
And I don't I'd love that.

1049
00:57:59,860 --> 00:58:02,360
I'd love to I stepped on something.

1050
00:58:02,360 --> 00:58:02,860
Hold on.

1051
00:58:02,860 --> 00:58:04,860
if

1052
00:58:04,860 --> 00:58:06,860
if

1053
00:58:06,860 --> 00:58:08,860
if

1054
00:58:08,860 --> 00:58:10,860
if

1055
00:58:10,860 --> 00:58:12,860
if

1056
00:58:12,860 --> 00:58:14,860
if

1057
00:58:14,860 --> 00:58:16,860
if

1058
00:58:16,860 --> 00:58:18,860
if

1059
00:58:18,860 --> 00:58:20,860
if

1060
00:58:20,860 --> 00:58:22,860
if

1061
00:58:22,860 --> 00:58:24,860
if

1062
00:58:24,860 --> 00:58:26,860
if

1063
00:58:26,860 --> 00:58:28,860
if

1064
00:58:28,860 --> 00:58:30,860
if

1065
00:58:30,860 --> 00:58:43,820
the

1066
00:58:44,820 --> 00:58:47,220
Ha ha ha ha! Wee! Yeah!

1067
00:58:47,220 --> 00:58:50,500
Okay, put me to hell! Put me to hell!

1068
00:58:50,500 --> 00:58:52,500
Yeah! Keep going!

1069
00:58:52,500 --> 00:58:54,500
Spin him some more! Spin him way more!

1070
00:58:54,500 --> 00:58:56,500
I'm still spinning, yeah!

1071
00:58:56,500 --> 00:58:59,700
Spin him so fast that it starts looking like you're going the opposite direction!

1072
00:58:59,700 --> 00:59:02,820
Okay! I'm spinning so fast it looks like we're standing completely still!

1073
00:59:02,820 --> 00:59:04,820
*laughter*

1074
00:59:04,820 --> 00:59:06,820
O-okay! We're okay!

1075
00:59:06,820 --> 00:59:08,820
We're drilling into the ground!

1076
00:59:08,820 --> 00:59:10,820
*laughter*

1077
00:59:10,820 --> 00:59:12,820
And then I let go by accident and he goes flying!

1078
00:59:12,820 --> 00:59:13,820
He goes flying.

1079
00:59:13,820 --> 00:59:14,820
He goes dead.

1080
00:59:14,820 --> 00:59:15,820
He turns to paste.

1081
00:59:15,820 --> 00:59:16,820
No!

1082
00:59:16,820 --> 00:59:24,220
He's dead, but the G-Force killed him before he let go of him anyway.

1083
00:59:24,220 --> 00:59:29,180
He's like in the Spongebob Fry Cook games where he falls splat and he just turns into

1084
00:59:29,180 --> 00:59:30,180
the number one.

1085
00:59:30,180 --> 00:59:31,180
Yeah.

1086
00:59:31,180 --> 00:59:32,700
And he's made it.

1087
00:59:32,700 --> 00:59:33,700
He's okay.

1088
00:59:33,700 --> 00:59:38,020
Yeah, everybody's super excited.

1089
00:59:38,020 --> 00:59:40,980
The White Woman of the Woods greets you all.

1090
00:59:40,980 --> 00:59:46,740
Thank you for freeing my Kubler elves and the mudmen will be so glad to hear of the dead

1091
00:59:46,740 --> 00:59:48,420
Sasquatch.

1092
00:59:48,420 --> 00:59:50,420
This is wonderful news.

1093
00:59:50,420 --> 00:59:54,580
You've truly changed the Whippet Woods for the better.

1094
00:59:54,580 --> 01:00:00,580
Yeah, we did.

1095
01:00:00,580 --> 01:00:01,820
You got anything else?

1096
01:00:01,820 --> 01:00:02,940
Can we leave this party?

1097
01:00:02,940 --> 01:00:06,980
I have social anxiety.

1098
01:00:06,980 --> 01:00:13,980
*laughter*

1099
01:00:13,980 --> 01:00:15,980
I'm starting to become uncomfortable.

1100
01:00:15,980 --> 01:00:17,980
Yeah, hold on a second.

1101
01:00:17,980 --> 01:00:20,980
Is there, uh, is there like, uh, anything...

1102
01:00:20,980 --> 01:00:22,980
You have like a fidget spinner.

1103
01:00:22,980 --> 01:00:24,980
Yeah, maybe...

1104
01:00:24,980 --> 01:00:28,980
You have any like, uh, you have any silly putty that he can play with?

1105
01:00:28,980 --> 01:00:30,980
I need something tactile.

1106
01:00:30,980 --> 01:00:34,980
You guys have like a quiet room or like a sensory...

1107
01:00:34,980 --> 01:00:36,980
Hold on, hold on, I got this.

1108
01:00:36,980 --> 01:00:38,480
An Etch-A-Sketch.

1109
01:00:38,480 --> 01:00:40,480
You could use...

1110
01:00:40,480 --> 01:00:42,480
I pull like...

1111
01:00:42,480 --> 01:00:44,980
It's a hot day, I figured I could do this.

1112
01:00:44,980 --> 01:00:46,980
And I pull like...

1113
01:00:46,980 --> 01:00:48,980
A bunch of like...

1114
01:00:48,980 --> 01:00:50,980
Ball skin?

1115
01:00:50,980 --> 01:00:54,980
And I hand it to Steven.

1116
01:00:54,980 --> 01:00:56,980
It's just like a big...

1117
01:00:56,980 --> 01:00:58,980
It's like a big like thing of silly putty.

1118
01:00:58,980 --> 01:01:01,980
Like a six foot long string of silly putty.

1119
01:01:01,980 --> 01:01:03,980
I'm not sure where you got this,

1120
01:01:03,980 --> 01:01:09,760
But it is seriously soothing my anxiety right now. Do not do not worry about it at all

1121
01:01:09,760 --> 01:01:16,960
I'm gonna focus on this and I will not follow the trail. I want to play with that too, and I start oh, yeah

1122
01:01:16,960 --> 01:01:23,500
Here's a scalpel

1123
01:01:23,500 --> 01:01:25,780
a lot of little pieces

1124
01:01:25,780 --> 01:01:30,460
Great idea. Yeah, do you guys have one of those molders where we could turn this into like a star?

1125
01:01:30,460 --> 01:01:33,140
circle you see the

1126
01:01:33,180 --> 01:01:37,220
Amazing it's amazing. I can't feel any of this Cooper. Elves come with a cookie tray

1127
01:01:37,220 --> 01:01:43,940
I thought you'd never ask it's like all these cookie cutter things you can use on these balls. You know I taste

1128
01:01:43,940 --> 01:01:46,300
I've

1129
01:01:46,300 --> 01:01:51,500
Hopped around and enrolled on these things so much. I actually I feel nothing yeah

1130
01:01:51,500 --> 01:01:55,260
Catalyst like a marathon runners heel

1131
01:02:00,500 --> 01:02:08,220
So yeah night begins to fall on the the affairs as things are you know getting on their way?

1132
01:02:08,220 --> 01:02:15,620
And the white woman of the woods she unveils she's gonna rename the pond because now she is

1133
01:02:15,620 --> 01:02:19,540
Not just from the pond. She's the whole woods are hers once again

1134
01:02:19,540 --> 01:02:27,740
She's renaming it to the trebuchet pond after the heroes who came from trebuchet village free the Cooper elves and restored the forest glory

1135
01:02:29,020 --> 01:02:34,020
Yeah, can you name it after us? I mean, that's that's just a town. What about working? Yeah, I don't think we

1136
01:02:34,020 --> 01:02:37,660
It's just a long it would just be a long name

1137
01:02:37,660 --> 01:02:45,060
The Patrick Steve old Ogun pond, I don't think that's too unwieldy

1138
01:02:45,060 --> 01:02:51,180
What about the Patrick's you owed our evil Steve? Oh and dog in the dirt goblin heroes pond

1139
01:02:51,180 --> 01:02:57,980
So the first one sounded doable. It's just they just we just announced it. Can we wait till tomorrow?

1140
01:02:58,340 --> 01:03:03,060
What about get it? I've got an idea. What if we name it the awesome zone?

1141
01:03:03,060 --> 01:03:07,820
You know what you guys picked the name. Let me know by the end of the night

1142
01:03:07,820 --> 01:03:12,340
Alright, you will will will work very hard on this

1143
01:03:12,340 --> 01:03:17,100
You don't have to worry. This is in great. I'm not worried

1144
01:03:17,100 --> 01:03:22,580
Inserts the west end of the pond there's like a big bonfire

1145
01:03:22,580 --> 01:03:27,800
There's a game of limbo that's being played, but everyone's really fucking short. It's all just

1146
01:03:27,800 --> 01:03:30,800
people are healthy guys people it's just people walking

1147
01:03:30,800 --> 01:03:31,800
yeah

1148
01:03:31,800 --> 01:03:34,800
they're just running

1149
01:03:34,800 --> 01:03:35,800
yeah

1150
01:03:35,800 --> 01:03:36,800
it's just

1151
01:03:36,800 --> 01:03:37,800
they're not

1152
01:03:37,800 --> 01:03:41,800
they're not lowering their head at all

1153
01:03:41,800 --> 01:03:43,800
cause they're too small to reach

1154
01:03:43,800 --> 01:03:45,800
they're just walking back and forth

1155
01:03:45,800 --> 01:03:46,800
yeah

1156
01:03:46,800 --> 01:03:48,800
and just like clapping and cheering

1157
01:03:48,800 --> 01:03:51,800
it's so much

1158
01:03:51,800 --> 01:03:52,800
they're having so much fun

1159
01:03:52,800 --> 01:03:53,800
their limb by limb by limb

1160
01:03:53,800 --> 01:03:57,500
There's one guy who's really tall and he hits it every time

1161
01:03:57,500 --> 01:03:58,500
and they have to him.

1162
01:03:58,500 --> 01:04:00,700
Oh rats.

1163
01:04:00,700 --> 01:04:02,600
There's like one tall Koop or else.

1164
01:04:02,600 --> 01:04:04,500
He's like three and a half feet tall.

1165
01:04:04,500 --> 01:04:06,100
His hat knocks the thing over.

1166
01:04:06,100 --> 01:04:12,700
There's also drinks being served by the sword in the stone

1167
01:04:12,700 --> 01:04:15,800
who returned to his true form of the woods have reverted

1168
01:04:15,800 --> 01:04:17,800
which is a guy with a sword in this head.

1169
01:04:17,800 --> 01:04:23,500
He's just there sort of serving drinks to everybody the mud

1170
01:04:23,500 --> 01:04:27,260
men are in the shade towards the east. They're enjoying the proceedings from afar. They're

1171
01:04:27,260 --> 01:04:32,580
trying to avoid the heat, you know, but they like the company of everybody. They showed

1172
01:04:32,580 --> 01:04:36,940
up as well later in the evening. Some of them fuse together by accident when they're exposed

1173
01:04:36,940 --> 01:04:42,980
to the flames. So they try to stay away as much as they can, but the white woman in the

1174
01:04:42,980 --> 01:04:49,620
woods just sort of gently sort of pulls them apart. There's also a group of people, a group

1175
01:04:49,620 --> 01:04:56,540
of Koobler elves telling stories, turns into impromptu dramatics and reenactments of their

1176
01:04:56,540 --> 01:05:00,220
time as slaves and the times to come.

1177
01:05:00,220 --> 01:05:06,220
Many of the Kooblers are so excited to be free that they immediately begin baking cookies.

1178
01:05:06,220 --> 01:05:11,380
Chocolate chip, oatmeal raisin, peanut butter, merry mint patties, lemon cream pie, caramel

1179
01:05:11,380 --> 01:05:16,860
nut dreams, jumbo fudge sticks, bite-sized snacking grams, elf fudge, elf witch chocolate,

1180
01:05:16,860 --> 01:05:22,060
The Amazing Spider-Man Graham Bites, Ripe Bites, Fudge Shop, Mini Fudge Stripes, and S'mores

1181
01:05:22,060 --> 01:05:23,460
Peanut Butter Original.

1182
01:05:23,460 --> 01:05:35,260
And Dirt Meal Raisin made my very own Grandma Kudler who joined in.

1183
01:05:35,260 --> 01:05:40,460
I was wondering where all my stuff was, but I'm so glad to see all my friends freed that

1184
01:05:40,460 --> 01:05:42,020
I don't give a fuck.

1185
01:05:42,020 --> 01:05:43,020
So hot dogs!

1186
01:05:43,020 --> 01:05:44,020
Hey, this granny swears.

1187
01:05:44,020 --> 01:05:51,020
is

1188
01:05:51,020 --> 01:05:55,260
it's bad it's a great deal it and it doesn't hurt

1189
01:05:55,260 --> 01:05:58,980
two-and-a-half minutes uh...

1190
01:05:58,980 --> 01:06:02,180
uh... any could it get any better than this

1191
01:06:02,180 --> 01:06:05,180
we guys do during the party what's going on

1192
01:06:05,180 --> 01:06:08,980
uh... i try to go under the limbo but my balls are too big

1193
01:06:08,980 --> 01:06:14,240
yeah i'd like to have been basically the the height of like a cooler alfred

1194
01:06:14,240 --> 01:06:18,140
yeah you're about the high but my balls make me just like a little bit yeah

1195
01:06:18,140 --> 01:06:18,980
- Yeah.

1196
01:06:18,980 --> 01:06:20,500
- So I'm trying to go under the limbo stick

1197
01:06:20,500 --> 01:06:23,260
and I actually have to like, I can't do it.

1198
01:06:23,260 --> 01:06:24,580
- Lean balls first.

1199
01:06:24,580 --> 01:06:26,100
Lean your balls first.

1200
01:06:26,100 --> 01:06:27,780
- You know, this sucks.

1201
01:06:27,780 --> 01:06:30,360
This, you need to make it taller.

1202
01:06:30,360 --> 01:06:31,200
It doesn't work.

1203
01:06:31,200 --> 01:06:32,500
You guys are not being,

1204
01:06:32,500 --> 01:06:35,340
- Is this ableist?

1205
01:06:35,340 --> 01:06:36,260
- I'm so mad.

1206
01:06:36,260 --> 01:06:37,980
- They all look very concerned.

1207
01:06:37,980 --> 01:06:39,660
- I'm so mad right now.

1208
01:06:39,660 --> 01:06:40,740
I'm just gonna go.

1209
01:06:40,740 --> 01:06:41,580
I'm gonna go.

1210
01:06:41,580 --> 01:06:42,940
I'm not gonna play this.

1211
01:06:42,940 --> 01:06:43,780
- Yeah.

1212
01:06:43,780 --> 01:06:46,900
- I follow Patrick around like a little brother

1213
01:06:46,900 --> 01:06:50,460
and i'm wearing like a like a goody that's like five sizes too big for me

1214
01:06:50,460 --> 01:06:53,820
yeah i'd like to wait past my hands on the sleeves

1215
01:06:53,820 --> 01:06:57,860
this is waiting for the person for the doll to be over you have a great

1216
01:06:57,860 --> 01:06:59,380
uselessly die like this

1217
01:06:59,380 --> 01:07:03,140
angle and i see the whole i'm just sitting in the corner creating a

1218
01:07:03,140 --> 01:07:06,340
destroying water over there

1219
01:07:06,340 --> 01:07:07,980
i i see

1220
01:07:07,980 --> 01:07:09,060
sullivan

1221
01:07:09,060 --> 01:07:13,580
across the party and he's not he's he's sitting alone kind of like

1222
01:07:13,580 --> 01:07:15,140
you know nursing his drink

1223
01:07:15,140 --> 01:07:18,740
and i i have a good sense of order and i i'd like

1224
01:07:18,740 --> 01:07:23,140
i like to have a lot of talk like a strand of like nasty ready goblin hair

1225
01:07:23,140 --> 01:07:25,260
behind one of my ears and i'm like

1226
01:07:25,260 --> 01:07:26,780
hey

1227
01:07:26,780 --> 01:07:28,220
and that

1228
01:07:28,220 --> 01:07:31,260
i'd rather it was that it was a

1229
01:07:31,260 --> 01:07:34,100
i think

1230
01:07:34,100 --> 01:07:35,660
it's not just

1231
01:07:35,660 --> 01:07:37,700
i reach out for

1232
01:07:37,700 --> 01:07:39,860
and i think i'd i'd take his hands

1233
01:07:39,860 --> 01:07:41,020
okay

1234
01:07:41,020 --> 01:07:43,020
Yeah, he's consenting to all this, it's all happening.

1235
01:07:43,020 --> 01:07:47,020
I'm holding his hand, and then I cast the spell Ceremony.

1236
01:07:47,020 --> 01:07:49,020
[laughter]

1237
01:07:49,020 --> 01:07:50,020
Oh wait.

1238
01:07:50,020 --> 01:07:52,020
And I choose the spell Ceremony, which is,

1239
01:07:52,020 --> 01:07:56,020
you perform a special religious ceremony that is infused with magic.

1240
01:07:56,020 --> 01:07:59,020
When you cast the spell, choose one of the following rites,

1241
01:07:59,020 --> 01:08:02,020
the target of which must be within ten feet of you throughout the casting.

1242
01:08:02,020 --> 01:08:05,020
And I choose the final option, which is Wedding.

1243
01:08:05,020 --> 01:08:10,020
[laughter]

1244
01:08:10,020 --> 01:08:13,020
So you are now Mr. Sullivan?

1245
01:08:13,020 --> 01:08:15,020
Dogen Sullivan?

1246
01:08:15,020 --> 01:08:18,020
Dogen the frog?

1247
01:08:18,020 --> 01:08:20,020
Dogen the frog?

1248
01:08:20,020 --> 01:08:22,020
You hyphenated it?

1249
01:08:22,020 --> 01:08:24,020
Yeah, I did a middle name thing.

1250
01:08:24,020 --> 01:08:27,020
I made my last name my middle name.

1251
01:08:27,020 --> 01:08:30,020
Sullivan does not know this is happening.

1252
01:08:30,020 --> 01:08:35,020
And he just feels a sudden shift in the universe.

1253
01:08:35,020 --> 01:08:38,020
Like, uh, hey.

1254
01:08:38,020 --> 01:08:44,100
For the next seven days, each target gains a +2 bonus to AC while they are within 30 feet of each other.

1255
01:08:44,100 --> 01:08:45,300
*laughter*

1256
01:08:45,300 --> 01:08:47,300
That's when you're married.

1257
01:08:47,300 --> 01:08:49,300
For a week.

1258
01:08:49,300 --> 01:08:51,300
God.

1259
01:08:51,300 --> 01:08:58,100
As soon as I realize that this is a wedding, I let loose, I start drinking champagne, I'm on the dance floor, I'm fucking doing the worm.

1260
01:08:58,100 --> 01:09:00,100
Go Steve-O! Go Steve-O!

1261
01:09:00,100 --> 01:09:02,100
Oh yeah! Oh yeah!

1262
01:09:02,100 --> 01:09:04,100
I run over to Dogen and Sullivan and I go,

1263
01:09:04,100 --> 01:09:06,100
THIS IS OUR SONG!

1264
01:09:06,100 --> 01:09:11,060
And then we get on the dance floor. That's like the first time I've ever yelled

1265
01:09:11,060 --> 01:09:15,940
And I get on the dance floor like

1266
01:09:15,940 --> 01:09:20,020
Listen listen, and then it plays Busta Move by uh

1267
01:09:20,020 --> 01:09:27,580
Yeah, medieval version. Yeah, the version of Busta Move, and then we just do the dance scene from the movie grind

1268
01:09:27,580 --> 01:09:32,020
Roll performance check

1269
01:09:32,980 --> 01:09:35,980
All of you. All of us? All of you.

1270
01:09:35,980 --> 01:09:37,980
I got a 10. I got a 16.

1271
01:09:37,980 --> 01:09:39,980
Uh...

1272
01:09:39,980 --> 01:09:42,980
I got... a 19.

1273
01:09:42,980 --> 01:09:45,980
I gotta roll for... ooh, I gotta roll for Solvin' too.

1274
01:09:45,980 --> 01:09:48,980
Dude, my worm is crazy right now on the dance floor.

1275
01:09:48,980 --> 01:09:49,980
Okay, let me get Solvin' up.

1276
01:09:49,980 --> 01:09:52,980
I roll out a giant cake.

1277
01:09:52,980 --> 01:09:56,980
And I'm like, "Yeah, hey, go ahead. Dig in."

1278
01:09:56,980 --> 01:10:00,980
And then as soon as someone touches it, the white woman of the woods pops out.

1279
01:10:00,980 --> 01:10:02,980
She's in a fucking black bikini.

1280
01:10:02,980 --> 01:10:03,980
*laughs* Yeah.

1281
01:10:03,980 --> 01:10:05,980
You like cast a spell to create that.

1282
01:10:05,980 --> 01:10:07,980
She's like, "Don't! Don't do that!"

1283
01:10:07,980 --> 01:10:09,980
Like, she's like somewhere else.

1284
01:10:09,980 --> 01:10:10,980
Um, uh...

1285
01:10:10,980 --> 01:10:12,980
"Get in the cake, you idiot!"

1286
01:10:12,980 --> 01:10:13,980
*laughs* And, uh...

1287
01:10:13,980 --> 01:10:16,980
"What'd I hire you for, you worst stripper ever!"

1288
01:10:16,980 --> 01:10:18,980
*laughs* And, uh, yeah, the performance...

1289
01:10:18,980 --> 01:10:20,980
You guys all do pretty solid.

1290
01:10:20,980 --> 01:10:22,980
Even Patrick Jodar, you did okay.

1291
01:10:22,980 --> 01:10:24,980
You guys are fucking living it up.

1292
01:10:24,980 --> 01:10:25,980
This is a jam for all the fellas.

1293
01:10:25,980 --> 01:10:26,980
The white woman of the woods.

1294
01:10:26,980 --> 01:10:28,980
Trying to do what the white woman of the woods tells us.

1295
01:10:28,980 --> 01:10:36,980
The white woman in the woods is dancing like a ho-ass in the fucking ass cake.

1296
01:10:36,980 --> 01:10:39,980
Like a ho-ass bitch.

1297
01:10:39,980 --> 01:10:43,980
I throw the bouquet. Who catches the bouquet?

1298
01:10:43,980 --> 01:10:45,980
Now you got it, got it good.

1299
01:10:45,980 --> 01:10:48,980
Grandma Koobler does.

1300
01:10:48,980 --> 01:10:52,980
She looks over at first a boy, and she's like "whoa!"

1301
01:10:52,980 --> 01:10:54,980
And then she...

1302
01:10:57,980 --> 01:10:59,420
And then who'd you look at?

1303
01:10:59,420 --> 01:11:01,020
Then it looks at a mudman.

1304
01:11:01,020 --> 01:11:02,020
Um, uh...

1305
01:11:02,020 --> 01:11:04,020
I do not want to see that child!

1306
01:11:04,020 --> 01:11:05,020
[laughter]

1307
01:11:05,020 --> 01:11:07,020
That is a fucked up...

1308
01:11:07,020 --> 01:11:09,020
I don't know that that's legal.

1309
01:11:09,020 --> 01:11:11,020
That is a man made of dirt!

1310
01:11:11,020 --> 01:11:12,020
[laughter]

1311
01:11:12,020 --> 01:11:13,020
Take the bouquet back.

1312
01:11:13,020 --> 01:11:16,020
You might as well be fucking a puddle, bitch.

1313
01:11:16,020 --> 01:11:18,020
Let's try this again.

1314
01:11:18,020 --> 01:11:19,020
Let's try this again.

1315
01:11:19,020 --> 01:11:20,020
Yeah.

1316
01:11:20,020 --> 01:11:21,020
And, uh...

1317
01:11:21,020 --> 01:11:22,020
Throw the bouquet again.

1318
01:11:22,020 --> 01:11:25,020
And as you throw the bouquet, it sails in the air,

1319
01:11:25,020 --> 01:11:31,020
and everything sort of slows down. Nothing bad's happening.

1320
01:11:31,020 --> 01:11:37,020
But the jester is no more. That spirit that you saw, had seen

1321
01:11:37,020 --> 01:11:41,020
Evil Stevel, that leaving, was the spirit of the jester leaving that Sasquatch.

1322
01:11:41,020 --> 01:11:45,020
It's last defiant act was to possess the Sasquatch.

1323
01:11:45,020 --> 01:11:49,020
You can hear the last gasping chortles and

1324
01:11:49,020 --> 01:11:53,020
chuckles of ethereal erasure, complete annihilation and particle loss.

1325
01:11:53,020 --> 01:11:58,860
loss, the end of the Jester's comedic play on the denizens of the Whippet Woods.

1326
01:11:58,860 --> 01:12:05,140
And unbeknownst to all of you, however, there's a great shift in the cosmos.

1327
01:12:05,140 --> 01:12:09,060
A small stirring works its way through the collective soul of the mortals that walk planet

1328
01:12:09,060 --> 01:12:10,060
E-Bound.

1329
01:12:10,060 --> 01:12:14,620
The particularly sensitive to these great magical adjustments grow a little aroused,

1330
01:12:14,620 --> 01:12:17,180
but nothing they can point to is particularly unusual.

1331
01:12:17,180 --> 01:12:21,580
However, secret knowledge has infected the hearts and minds of the immortal spirits that

1332
01:12:21,580 --> 01:12:26,820
litter the planet. The long forgotten angel of virtue too, the police, possesses this special

1333
01:12:26,820 --> 01:12:29,380
knowing, and perhaps lies in wait.

1334
01:12:29,380 --> 01:12:36,820
Patrick, Dogen, and Evil, you have made yourselves aware to the conscious and unconscious forces

1335
01:12:36,820 --> 01:12:41,940
of planet E-Bomb. There is an unseen counsel, an imperceptible communication made between

1336
01:12:41,940 --> 01:12:47,340
the elements, a quiet, cosmic acknowledgement of the destiny of you three mortals. You have

1337
01:12:47,340 --> 01:12:52,600
become worthy and that worthiness would frighten you if you could sense its implications.

1338
01:12:52,600 --> 01:12:58,720
And as the bouquet flies slowly into the air and that sort of cosmic knowing goes across

1339
01:12:58,720 --> 01:13:07,040
the universe, it continues again and it lands and Prince Jumanji catches it and uh...

1340
01:13:07,040 --> 01:13:08,040
Oh no.

1341
01:13:08,040 --> 01:13:11,040
There better be another baby in this room.

1342
01:13:11,040 --> 01:13:12,040
I'm sorry!

1343
01:13:12,040 --> 01:13:13,040
Don't look at me!

1344
01:13:13,040 --> 01:13:14,040
Don't look at me!

1345
01:13:14,040 --> 01:13:15,040
I'm sorry!

1346
01:13:15,040 --> 01:13:16,040
Get the boy!

1347
01:13:16,040 --> 01:13:17,040
I didn't mean to.

1348
01:13:17,040 --> 01:13:18,040
I didn't mean to.

1349
01:13:18,040 --> 01:13:19,040
Close your eyes!

1350
01:13:19,040 --> 01:13:20,040
Okay, I'm closing my eyes.

1351
01:13:20,040 --> 01:13:21,040
Look at that bug in front of you.

1352
01:13:21,040 --> 01:13:22,040
Oh, where?

1353
01:13:22,040 --> 01:13:23,040
Should I open my eyes?

1354
01:13:23,040 --> 01:13:24,040
Yeah, look at the bug.

1355
01:13:24,040 --> 01:13:25,040
Okay, I'm looking at...

1356
01:13:25,040 --> 01:13:26,040
Alright, boys, we're safe.

1357
01:13:26,040 --> 01:13:27,040
Okay.

1358
01:13:27,040 --> 01:13:28,040
Should I kiss the bug?

1359
01:13:28,040 --> 01:13:29,040
Yeah.

1360
01:13:29,040 --> 01:13:30,040
Yeah, go ahead, kiss that bug.

1361
01:13:30,040 --> 01:13:31,040
Okay.

1362
01:13:31,040 --> 01:13:34,040
And the night goes on like that until we return today.

1363
01:13:34,040 --> 01:13:34,540
Yeah.

1364
01:13:34,540 --> 01:13:38,040
Yeah, go ahead, kiss that bug.

1365
01:13:38,040 --> 01:13:40,040
Okay, and uh...

1366
01:13:40,040 --> 01:13:42,840
The night goes on like that...

1367
01:13:42,840 --> 01:13:44,040
Until...

1368
01:13:44,040 --> 01:13:45,540
Uh, we return today.

1369
01:13:45,540 --> 01:13:47,040
And you guys all...

1370
01:13:47,040 --> 01:13:51,740
Wake up in just whatever fucking vile mess you- you're in.

1371
01:13:51,740 --> 01:13:52,540
Yeah.

1372
01:13:52,540 --> 01:13:54,040
We're all hungover.

1373
01:13:54,040 --> 01:13:54,540
Yeah.

1374
01:13:54,540 --> 01:13:55,040
Yeah.

1375
01:13:55,040 --> 01:14:01,740
Can I say that I- can I say that we- we've all co- we all got so drunk that we completely forgot that me and Sullivan got married.

1376
01:14:01,740 --> 01:14:03,740
*laughing*

1377
01:14:03,740 --> 01:14:05,740
You just get the buff.

1378
01:14:05,740 --> 01:14:07,740
Yeah, wait.

1379
01:14:07,740 --> 01:14:09,740
Wasn't there some kind of wedding last night?

1380
01:14:09,740 --> 01:14:11,740
I think- Something weird happened

1381
01:14:11,740 --> 01:14:13,740
there at the queen's throne.

1382
01:14:13,740 --> 01:14:15,740
Oh shit, you know what it was? That little kid married a

1383
01:14:15,740 --> 01:14:17,740
bug!

1384
01:14:17,740 --> 01:14:19,740
That shit just sucked up.

1385
01:14:19,740 --> 01:14:21,740
Does that make the bug

1386
01:14:21,740 --> 01:14:23,740
the queen?

1387
01:14:23,740 --> 01:14:25,740
Oh my god.

1388
01:14:25,740 --> 01:14:27,740
The princess. I think that's the next

1389
01:14:27,740 --> 01:14:29,740
story arc.

1390
01:14:29,740 --> 01:14:36,020
I feel like it's gonna die probably in like a week. I get I roll over and I'm like nah, man

1391
01:14:36,020 --> 01:14:38,020
We'll find that bug we'll take care of it

1392
01:14:38,020 --> 01:14:41,460
Flat on my back

1393
01:14:41,460 --> 01:14:46,020
Yeah

1394
01:14:46,020 --> 01:14:50,620
Yeah, you see Sullivan like Sullivan looks at his hand and he sees a ring and he's like, huh?

1395
01:14:50,620 --> 01:14:53,540
And he's like, hmm

1396
01:14:53,540 --> 01:14:58,820
Ling Sullivan makes it off. It puts it in his pocket. He's on my palm this way. He doesn't know what it is

1397
01:14:58,820 --> 01:15:13,620
is

1398
01:15:13,620 --> 01:15:15,620
Is there any kind of...

1399
01:15:15,620 --> 01:15:18,620
What's our achievement percentage right now?

1400
01:15:18,620 --> 01:15:20,620
Yeah, what's the word I'm looking for?

1401
01:15:20,620 --> 01:15:23,620
How many locked trophies are there?

1402
01:15:23,620 --> 01:15:27,620
His eyes go white.

1403
01:15:27,620 --> 01:15:32,620
At this time, I cannot disclose how many side quests remain.

1404
01:15:32,620 --> 01:15:39,620
Can you point us in the direction of one or is this kind of like a morrowind thing?

1405
01:15:39,620 --> 01:15:46,120
It's closer to the Elder Scrolls than it is to say Morrowind in particular, right?

1406
01:15:46,120 --> 01:15:47,420
It's not quite like a...

1407
01:15:47,420 --> 01:15:48,820
Yeah, there's no quest markers?

1408
01:15:48,820 --> 01:15:50,120
Yeah, no waypoints.

1409
01:15:50,120 --> 01:15:51,820
Crap, I think we leave.

1410
01:15:51,820 --> 01:15:53,020
Is that okay?

1411
01:15:53,020 --> 01:15:55,520
Yeah, I'm getting the fuck out of these woods, dude.

1412
01:15:55,520 --> 01:15:56,520
I'm out.

1413
01:15:56,520 --> 01:15:57,520
Okay.

1414
01:15:57,520 --> 01:16:00,020
Alright, well I'll still show you out.

1415
01:16:00,020 --> 01:16:04,820
The mud men lead you through back to their village.

1416
01:16:04,820 --> 01:16:09,420
And they clear a path in the mud.

1417
01:16:09,420 --> 01:16:12,920
They sort of do a Moses parting of the mud and you see sort

1418
01:16:12,920 --> 01:16:15,720
of a clear shot out through the woods.

1419
01:16:15,720 --> 01:16:19,820
And as you walk out, you know, you exit the whip at woods.

1420
01:16:19,820 --> 01:16:23,020
You've changed it from a cackling nightmare into a normal

1421
01:16:23,020 --> 01:16:27,120
place for kindly Cooper elves and a goodly womanly spirit

1422
01:16:27,120 --> 01:16:31,820
Trunchbull and other seasoned adventurers have maybe traveled

1423
01:16:31,820 --> 01:16:34,020
this far outside the village, but it's not something any of

1424
01:16:34,020 --> 01:16:36,420
you anticipated doing so soon.

1425
01:16:36,420 --> 01:16:38,980
Clock Castle, you can see it now.

1426
01:16:38,980 --> 01:16:41,540
You're two weeks away from it, but it's such a massive looming figure.

1427
01:16:41,540 --> 01:16:45,420
You can see it as a speck in the distance.

1428
01:16:45,420 --> 01:16:48,900
Black against a blood-red sky of the Terrifier's Kingdom.

1429
01:16:48,900 --> 01:16:51,020
It's familiar foreboding view.

1430
01:16:51,020 --> 01:16:54,460
It fills you guys with a sense of ease, like there's something.

1431
01:16:54,460 --> 01:16:55,460
We can get there.

1432
01:16:55,460 --> 01:16:56,900
We can get home.

1433
01:16:56,900 --> 01:17:01,860
But what you also see is that Mount Honestoodle, which once stood so high that it could be seen

1434
01:17:01,860 --> 01:17:06,820
from here much more clearly than the castle could. Can't be seen at all.

1435
01:17:06,820 --> 01:17:13,220
And you see Sullivan and the young prince's face fall at this realization that they don't

1436
01:17:13,220 --> 01:17:18,860
know where Mount Honestoodle is. However, outstretched before you is an endless

1437
01:17:18,860 --> 01:17:23,580
road, a new chapter, a new story. Returning the prince to the Terrifier Kingdom

1438
01:17:23,580 --> 01:17:26,140
is but a blip. Nice.

1439
01:17:26,140 --> 01:17:28,860
That was the blip. Yeah.

1440
01:17:28,860 --> 01:17:35,860
that

1441
01:17:35,860 --> 01:17:49,740
is

1442
01:17:49,740 --> 01:17:50,740
world.

1443
01:17:50,740 --> 01:17:52,340
What happens when Casey Anthony gets a hold of him?

1444
01:17:52,340 --> 01:17:54,340
Do you really want that to happen again?

1445
01:17:54,340 --> 01:17:57,340
I guess I was feeling angry at kids.

1446
01:17:57,340 --> 01:18:00,980
She's innocent, I just want to say.

1447
01:18:00,980 --> 01:18:02,980
She was declared innocent.

1448
01:18:02,980 --> 01:18:08,620
But in a small town between the Whippet Woods and Trebuchet Village, the sluggish humdrum

1449
01:18:08,620 --> 01:18:10,500
of life plods on.

1450
01:18:10,500 --> 01:18:15,100
The pleasant stupidity of the peasantry goes unabated by the death of Prince Jumanji.

1451
01:18:15,100 --> 01:18:17,300
Oh, yes, you didn't know.

1452
01:18:17,300 --> 01:18:19,500
The kingdom thinks that the young prince has died.

1453
01:18:19,500 --> 01:18:21,080
You don't know this.

1454
01:18:21,080 --> 01:18:26,780
With only our heroes and the brave lion seemingly knowing the truth, King Nardwaur has been inconsolable,

1455
01:18:26,780 --> 01:18:30,840
locking himself and his favorite bard in his room, who has been playing the medieval version

1456
01:18:30,840 --> 01:18:35,780
of Had a Bad Day for four days straight now.

1457
01:18:35,780 --> 01:18:41,800
But in this small town, this is nothing short of news that hasn't yet reached their ears.

1458
01:18:41,800 --> 01:18:52,560
But what has reached your ears is something of a bounty on three nasty little men who

1459
01:18:52,560 --> 01:18:57,280
killed a beloved bounty hunter.

1460
01:18:57,280 --> 01:19:06,720
And in this town, you see a person, dunk, dunk, dunk, nail something, reward 1,000 gold

1461
01:19:06,720 --> 01:19:11,920
pieces and three just awfully crude drawings of you three.

1462
01:19:11,920 --> 01:19:15,520
I thought it was going to be some other people. No.

1463
01:19:15,520 --> 01:19:18,320
Who do you think it was going to be some bad guys?

1464
01:19:18,320 --> 01:19:24,820
Yeah, you do bad guys and reward 1000 gold report to your late

1465
01:19:24,820 --> 01:19:30,820
nearest Brave Lion to collect the reward and we zoom back away

1466
01:19:30,820 --> 01:19:34,120
from that town away from all these little details about what's

1467
01:19:34,120 --> 01:19:35,220
going on in the world things.

1468
01:19:35,220 --> 01:19:38,120
you don't know about and we bring back to you guys here.

1469
01:19:38,120 --> 01:19:39,120
You are outside of the whip.

1470
01:19:39,120 --> 01:19:43,320
It woods the road ahead is there's lots of different things.

1471
01:19:43,320 --> 01:19:46,920
You can do I'll say this.

1472
01:19:46,920 --> 01:19:48,720
Do you want to go north?

1473
01:19:48,720 --> 01:19:53,120
Do you want to go South East or West which directions the

1474
01:19:53,120 --> 01:19:56,520
castle the castle is north of you?

1475
01:19:56,520 --> 01:20:02,420
Maybe we go just Northeast just the yeah, it's the throw a

1476
01:20:02,420 --> 01:20:06,700
little, little English on it. Yeah. All right. Little flavoring.

1477
01:20:06,700 --> 01:20:08,060
I'm writing this down.

1478
01:20:08,060 --> 01:20:15,460
And we'll pick up next time on what all that means.

1479
01:20:15,460 --> 01:20:23,180
That's a jam for all the colors. Try to do what those ladies tell ya.

1480
01:20:23,180 --> 01:20:27,300
Get shot down cause you're overzealous. Play hard to get females get jealous.

1481
01:20:27,300 --> 01:20:31,420
Okay, smarty. Go to a party. Girls are scantily clad and showing body.

1482
01:20:31,420 --> 01:20:44,420
[music]
