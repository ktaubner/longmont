Yeah.

31
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:29,800
OK, I don't see the connection to

32
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:31,460
Ukraine at all, but I see

33
00:01:31,460 --> 00:01:33,000
it. It's got a weird bottle.

34
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:33,780
I picked it up because it had a

35
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:34,880
weird bottle. I'm going to take a

36
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:36,680
quick sip and give you guys a

37
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:39,360

So like a five foot four

guy. So like a zero out of 10.

43
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:56,020
No.

44
00:01:56,020 --> 00:02:01,240
Last week, uh, since last week's episode was such a, such a hit, such a massive hit

45
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:02,160
among the masses.

46
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:02,800
Yeah.

47
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:07,200
Uh, I went to the grocery store, uh, right before, before recording this.

48
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:14,160
And I was, I was like, I need to pick out the most colorful, the most pink, uh,

49
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:17,400
cans that I can find just like Rex did last week.

50
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:19,000
Cause he said, those were so good.

51
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,520
This is what I, what I came up with.

52
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:25,800
I got a lemon dao, it's in Japanese,

53
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:28,340
lemon dao, lemon sour, honey lemon,

54
00:02:28,340 --> 00:02:31,440
which I think is vodka. - Sounds delicious.

55
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:35,280
- And this just says, "Begara, suava brava."

56
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:36,840
- Okay. - That sounds yummy.

57
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:40,240
- Oh, and this might interest you, Julio.

58
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:42,560
Guess what I had today on my fruit?

59
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:45,160
- Beer?

60
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:48,000
- No, try again.

61
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:48,840
- Tahini.

62
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:51,120
- Very close.

63
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:53,800
- Oh, chamoy. - Chamoy.

64
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:58,160
So I have been into different flavors this week.

65
00:02:58,160 --> 00:02:59,440
So there's-- - You have entered

66
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:02,120
a completely authentic mood, is what you're saying.

67
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:06,840
- I, when I was picking up my stuff,

68
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:08,680
next to me was an L Super.

69
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:12,040
So I went to L Supermarket.

70
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:14,320
- Okay. - Mm-hmm.

71
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:17,600
And they had a section labeled cerveza.

72
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:22,040
And please tell me you indulged.

73
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:25,980
Well, I tried to get, I wanted a zero alcohol beer.

74
00:03:25,980 --> 00:03:28,500
I guess I should say I'm on antibiotics right now.

75
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:33,200
So I'm drinking Jarritos that I bought.

76
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:36,420
That is bullshit that you're, no, we're not clapping.

77
00:03:36,420 --> 00:03:37,960
I don't clap it up for that.

78
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:38,920
Okay.

79
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:41,760
You can drink on antibiotics.

80
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:44,320
No, they make them less effective.

81
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:45,640
Who cares?

82
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:47,260
It won't kill you.

83
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:53,500
I can't believe you got antibiotics for a cold in the first place that is a cold

84
00:03:53,500 --> 00:04:00,500
most it's not a cold it's like a respiratory and oh wait it's a

85
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:05,140
respiratory it's of that's a fucking cold it's okay I don't think we talked

86
00:04:05,140 --> 00:04:09,100
about this on any shows but isn't it weird how there's always some fucked up

87
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:15,180
illness going around New York every time we're in town yeah can I mean I think no

88
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:19,060
I think someone said that it could have been me bringing,

89
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:22,260
I think Noah said this, that he brought in Mexican viruses.

90
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:26,260
And then Cam said that he brought in Boston viruses.

91
00:04:26,260 --> 00:04:28,100
But I don't know, it always happens.

92
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:29,460
Something crazy's happening.

93
00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:34,580
- I'm gonna blame, I'll blame you.

94
00:04:34,580 --> 00:04:36,740
Yeah, out of everyone who's around.

95
00:04:36,740 --> 00:04:39,340
I feel like you're probably the easiest to blame.

96
00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:42,420
You know, you should not be allowed into the country

97
00:04:42,420 --> 00:04:45,480
like a bug that sneaks on a tomato or something

98
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:47,100
that could like ruin an entire crop.

99
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:48,460
That's kind of you.

100
00:04:48,460 --> 00:04:49,300
Yeah.

101
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:50,980
You need to be like a customs agent

102
00:04:50,980 --> 00:04:55,060
needs to like check every bag to see if you're in it.

103
00:04:55,060 --> 00:04:57,220
And then if you are, then you'd be like,

104
00:04:57,220 --> 00:04:59,600
oh, nice try, buddy.

105
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:00,780
This is not allowed.

106
00:05:00,780 --> 00:05:03,020
He'll destroy the entire-

107
00:05:03,020 --> 00:05:06,300
I don't think I've ever had like a negative interaction

108
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:07,380
with a custom people.

109
00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:10,660
You said that you got mad the other day at the guy

110
00:05:10,660 --> 00:05:12,100
'cause he was taking long.

111
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:14,200
- Well, yeah, I got mad at him because it was taking long,

112
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:16,460
but when I went through, he was just like,

113
00:05:16,460 --> 00:05:17,300
"What are you doing here?"

114
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:18,140
I'm like, "Oh, I'm just gonna stay here.

115
00:05:18,140 --> 00:05:20,240
"I'm gonna go see some friends."

116
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:21,120
And that's it.

117
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:22,160
- Here's me.

118
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:23,780
Here, you be the custom guy.

119
00:05:23,780 --> 00:05:24,620
- Okay.

120
00:05:24,620 --> 00:05:28,560
Motives of travel, why are you here?

121
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:29,400
- Pardon me?

122
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:32,320
You wanna try that again?

123
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:34,560
- Why are you in the country?

124
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:36,440
What are you coming from?

125
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:37,280
- As far as I'm concerned,

126
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:39,680
that's none of your fucking business, little guy.

127
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:40,760
How about you get out of my way?

128
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:43,360
He stands in front of the door, right?

129
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:45,280
Oh, well why do you even go up to him?

130
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:47,200
- He sits off to the right.

131
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:48,040
- Yeah. - Or the left.

132
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:50,200
- So, how it works is--

133
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:51,040
- Why are you even walking out?

134
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:53,800
You could get off the plane and just go.

135
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:55,320
- That is, okay.

136
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:56,680
So here-- - There's police there, dude.

137
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:59,200
- Here is now-- - I don't care.

138
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:01,280
- It is, we're now fully exposing

139
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:04,440
how Caleb has never even been on a plane,

140
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:05,840
let alone out to the country.

141
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:08,880
- I've actually been to Ukraine.

142
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:10,320
- So-- - I went to Lviv.

143
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:17,760
He doesn't know that when you come into the US for a foreign country, you get, you just

144
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:24,280
get sent through this like, um, hallway straight to the customs area.

145
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:27,900
You can't go anywhere else because everything is either like cordoned off or like just completely

146
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:30,880
blocked off for you to like not to access that area.

147
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:36,120
You are all led through this like, these, this, this set of hallways and you end up

148
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:39,960
at this big line, these two lines, this big room,

149
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:43,460
one of them is for nationals, US citizens.

150
00:06:43,460 --> 00:06:48,040
Those you can just go in and show your thing

151
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:49,920
and you just go through, no problem.

152
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:51,640
- So why don't you just walk into that line?

153
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:55,640
- Because I am a foreigner from a foreign country.

154
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:59,060
So I have to go line up at the foreigner line

155
00:06:59,060 --> 00:07:01,600
and I have to go with all the other Mexicans

156
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:05,760
and Salvadorians and Guatemalans and Asians and Europeans.

157
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:09,760
I have to stand in line, then it's just a set of cubicles.

158
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:11,960
Why not Africans?

159
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:13,060
They're also there sometimes.

160
00:07:13,060 --> 00:07:14,000
Oh, okay.

161
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,060
Not often, though.

162
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:16,300
You skipped Africa.

163
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:17,560
It's kind of weird.

164
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:18,200
Yeah.

165
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:21,500
So, it's a set of cubicles, and you walk up,

166
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:23,800
and they just ask you, like, "Where are you here?

167
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:25,800
How long are you staying? Where are you staying?"

168
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:27,760
You know, the usual stuff.

169
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:29,460
And you always slide with them.

170
00:07:29,460 --> 00:07:32,400
You don't give them a lot of details.

171
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:33,800
You just go, "I'm here for a week.

172
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:36,040
I'm gonna see some friends, I'm gonna do some shopping.

173
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:37,240
They'll be like, "You got any money with you?"

174
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:38,200
I'm like, "Nope."

175
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:39,360
"How you gonna do some shopping?"

176
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:40,200
"With my card."

177
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:41,400
And they're like, "Hmm."

178
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:43,720
- They try to do trick questions on you?

179
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:44,840
- Yeah, pretty much.

180
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:45,800
- Whoa.

181
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:47,000
- Yeah.

182
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,440
So next time you're,

183
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:51,560
next time you are Mexican,

184
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:54,920
and you find yourself in customs.

185
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:56,760
- If I really mess up this life

186
00:07:56,760 --> 00:08:00,280
and karmically get put in Mexico in the next one,

187
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:03,440
then I will be sure to keep this in the back of my head.

188
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:08,440
Yeah. So yeah, that's my experience as a foreigner.

189
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:10,080
But you know what?

190
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:13,280
I am so glad that I'm back home.

191
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:17,960
I cannot, words cannot express how comfortable I am.

192
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:22,600
I am not in an Airbnb fested with rats.

193
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:23,440
Yeah.

194
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:25,320
That scratch my walls every day.

195
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:27,760
Yeah, I'm pretty happy you guys are gone too.

196
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:29,680
You are?

197
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:31,160
Yeah, I'm not spending any money.

198
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:33,120
I'm just sitting in my apartment all day.

199
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:37,260
Yeah, I was thinking about it's so nice to not spend so much money.

200
00:08:37,260 --> 00:08:38,960
Oh, it's the best.

201
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:42,120
Oh, my God. I'm not going to Brooklyn, spending $100 on

202
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:44,860
just chicken tenders and shit.

203
00:08:44,860 --> 00:08:46,760
Fuck them. Yeah, I'm back home.

204
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:48,660
I have beer. I last night's up two hours.

205
00:08:48,660 --> 00:08:51,320
Last night I feel incredible today.

206
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:53,420
I don't know why.

207
00:08:53,420 --> 00:08:55,760
That is the two hour buff.

208
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:59,960
Yeah, I got that perfect amount of sleep where it's basically my body

209
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:01,280
registered as a nap.

210
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:04,580
It thinks I'm in some kind of combat zone at the moment.

211
00:09:04,580 --> 00:09:06,780
You're the same day as you were yesterday.

212
00:09:06,780 --> 00:09:08,480
You're wearing the camo hat.

213
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:09,380
I'm wearing the camo hat.

214
00:09:09,380 --> 00:09:11,180
I'm listening to

215
00:09:11,180 --> 00:09:12,480
Brandon,

216
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:13,220
now,

217
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:13,580
Brandon,

218
00:09:13,580 --> 00:09:15,880
our battlefield, bad company, Vietnam soundtrack.

219
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:17,020
I'm doing that.

220
00:09:17,020 --> 00:09:18,520
Why play?

221
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:21,220
I almost said play the dishes.

222
00:09:21,220 --> 00:09:24,680
Yeah, he's feeling so good right now.

223
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:26,920
I'm at 100 percent.

224
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:29,280
OK, I'm not.

225
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:31,280
Watch me flick this cap.

226
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:35,920
I flew that, I mean it went damn near four feet.

227
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:39,160
You know what? New test. Do a backflip right now.

228
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:42,840
I couldn't do a backflip even if I was well rested,

229
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:45,000
which means I probably can do one now.

230
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,960
Unfortunately, I have no room in my...

231
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:50,280
I mean, I have a bed. I guess I could try it on the bed.

232
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:52,480
No, I'm not going to do that.

233
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:55,360
No, no, no.

234
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:57,880
Look at Rex's face. He's so sad because he's so sick

235
00:09:57,880 --> 00:09:59,940
you won't even do a back before smiling.

236
00:09:59,940 --> 00:10:03,580
Rex has got the ugliest shit I've ever seen on his face.

237
00:10:03,580 --> 00:10:05,960
That face is bad, but

238
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:09,720
don't say I have the ugliest shit on my face.

239
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:13,220
I'm saying that you were making an ugly shit face.

240
00:10:13,220 --> 00:10:17,460
But I've also I have I have the only problem I've had.

241
00:10:17,460 --> 00:10:20,900
The only thing that's been wrong with having about two hours of sleep is the

242
00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:25,180
having like probably the worst acid reflux of my entire life today.

243
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:29,600
And beer is making it so much worse actively.

244
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:30,400
So,

245
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:35,600
quite a bit.

246
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:36,200
I took a,

247
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:37,000
uh,

248
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,560
what do you call that shit?

249
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:40,720
Like a Prilosec,

250
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:42,960
but not the delayed one.

251
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:43,440
The like,

252
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:43,720
yeah,

253
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:45,480
the immediate release.

254
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:48,280
I took like an anti acid thing.

255
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:49,400
So hopefully that helps now,

256
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:49,800
but,

257
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:50,040
uh,

258
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:50,200
yeah,

259
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:51,160
I'm not doing so hot today.

260
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:52,640
When I,

261
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:53,680
when I came home,

262
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:54,880
I took a nap.

263
00:10:54,880 --> 00:11:00,640
And I get really bad acid reflux sometimes to the point where it will choke me out

264
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:06,320
while I'm sleeping. Oh yeah. And then I'll wake up just like heaving and like choking.

265
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:11,360
It happened twice when I came home. It was dope. That's awful.

266
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:19,080
Yeah, when I was like over 200 pounds, I got that all pretty much every single morning. I

267
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:23,400
I would wake up to just gargling on my own vomit,

268
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:24,240
basically like breaking that.

269
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:25,600
- It's really sweet.

270
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:27,160
- But yeah, I wasn't even able to,

271
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:28,400
they wouldn't even let me die.

272
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:31,120
It just was like the most uncomfortable feeling.

273
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:32,800
- Does this happen every night, Rex?

274
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:33,640
Does this happen in New York?

275
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:34,960
- No.

276
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:35,800
- Okay. - Just when I came back.

277
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:39,800
- So I wanna posit a possible scenario.

278
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:43,160
Maybe it's your crazy room.

279
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:44,880
- Yeah, I think it is.

280
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:47,320
It's only started since I've been in this room.

281
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:48,960
- What's so crazy about your room?

282
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:50,840
- Do you have particulate?

283
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:52,400
- I think there's particulates in my room.

284
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:53,840
I think there's mold.

285
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:54,680
- There's voice in the particulate.

286
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:56,920
- There's moldy particulates.

287
00:11:56,920 --> 00:12:01,920
- I hate molded particulates, especially specific ones.

288
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:03,840
- Right. - That's awful.

289
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:05,160
- As soon as he got to New York,

290
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:07,360
the first day he was like, "Dude, I feel so good.

291
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:10,200
"I feel like I'm so energetic and I'm so awake."

292
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:12,040
I was like, "Okay, what do you mean?"

293
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:15,800
He's like, "Yeah, every time I just spend the day in my room,

294
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:19,960
I feel like so sleepy and I can't even like stay awake.

295
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:21,520
And we're like, yeah, I think there's something wrong

296
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:22,360
with your room.

297
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:24,480
- You do have molded particulate in your room.

298
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:25,600
- Yeah, I do. - There's no doubt.

299
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:28,600
You have black mold like a Extreme Home Makeover house.

300
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:30,960
You remember the, did you guys ever watch that show?

301
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:32,720
- Yeah. - Extreme Home Makeover?

302
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:34,840
- Extreme Home Makeover, where they would go

303
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:36,920
into the person's house and they would like,

304
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:39,200
behind like a bunch of people would be like,

305
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:41,640
yeah, I don't know why, but like anytime I walk

306
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:44,480
into my house, I basically fall asleep in 20 seconds

307
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:48,360
and I like pass out on the floor and my dog starts trying to get my clothes off my body.

308
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:53,160
And then they would be like, they would show the fucking, what's the handsome guy?

309
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:55,160
The car dealership man.

310
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:56,160
Chris Hansen?

311
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:57,160
No, not him.

312
00:12:57,160 --> 00:12:58,160
Chris Hansen.

313
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:04,840
He would walk over to a closet and he'd move just like a bunch of recycling they had stacked

314
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:14,040
up and behind it would be like a Last of Us style, like giant black mold splotch.

315
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:15,600
and he'd be like, "I think this is the problem."

316
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:19,280
And then the people would always be like, "What?"

317
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:21,080
We had that, like something that you would,

318
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:22,360
anybody would notice this.

319
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:24,540
It's like black mold, it's black.

320
00:13:24,540 --> 00:13:26,800
Most people don't have black walls.

321
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:27,720
- Yeah. - And these people

322
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:30,600
just had no idea for years and years and years.

323
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:32,440
And they're like eating it. - Did I ever show you guys

324
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:34,960
the picture of like what my ceiling looked like

325
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:37,640
in my previous room before I moved here?

326
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:40,240
- Yeah, it had all those glowing stars all over it.

327
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:41,960
- Yeah, it was so crazy.

328
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:44,300
- Big head Julio plus Caleb.

329
00:13:44,300 --> 00:13:48,340
- Yeah, no, it didn't have that.

330
00:13:48,340 --> 00:13:49,680
It had holes and--

331
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:50,640
- It did.

332
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:52,640
- It was falling off the roof.

333
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:55,600
- You had a custom big head made of me.

334
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:56,600
- No.

335
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:57,440
- Yeah.

336
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:58,840
- They're called fat heads.

337
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:02,040
- Fat, big, fat head made of me.

338
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:04,000
- Bald heads, that's what they're called.

339
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,220
- Okay, continue your story.

340
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:08,380
- I forgot what I was talking about this.

341
00:14:08,380 --> 00:14:09,980
- You were talking about your ceiling.

342
00:14:09,980 --> 00:14:14,180
I think I also had like a crazy fucked up feeling because I didn't really think about it but

343
00:14:14,180 --> 00:14:21,020
I guess I was kind of like very low energy while I was in that room.

344
00:14:21,020 --> 00:14:25,980
But not, I don't know if to the point where I'm like, it's a very noticeable difference

345
00:14:25,980 --> 00:14:31,180
as Rex, as soon as he's like stepped out of his house, he's like, "Oh man, I feel so great.

346
00:14:31,180 --> 00:14:32,180
I feel so good.

347
00:14:32,180 --> 00:14:33,860
I want to walk around every day."

348
00:14:33,860 --> 00:14:38,320
It was really funny because you know like we were walking around a bunch in New

349
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:44,080
York and my phone like the the next day after I got home was like huh your new

350
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:52,640
energy levels seem to have dropped off after yesterday something wrong do you

351
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:59,800
wear a smartwatch that tells you all that shit no wait what time is it I

352
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:03,800
I thought maybe that was the beginning of some new segment.

353
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:05,800
I guess not.

354
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:07,800
We take Rex's

355
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:09,800
accessories for watching.

356
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:11,800
What do you got? Show me.

357
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:13,800
Nothing!

358
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:15,800
Bang.

359
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:17,800
I don't have any clapping.

360
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:19,800
That's okay.

361
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:21,800
All I have is this bandaid

362
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:23,800
from where I gave blood.

363
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:25,800
You gave blood?

364
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:27,800
Okay, that way we didn't need to know that.

365
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:28,800
- They took my blood.

366
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:30,120
- Oh. - They took my blood.

367
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:33,400
- Oh, okay, so you're trying to make it sound charitable,

368
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:35,260
but you're actually just sick.

369
00:15:35,260 --> 00:15:37,080
- No, I would never give my blood.

370
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:38,680
- Dude, me neither.

371
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:40,800
No matter how broke I've been in my life,

372
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:43,040
I have never once thought about giving plasma

373
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:44,440
because it scares me so bad.

374
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:46,960
I think I'd be the first person to die from it.

375
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:48,000
- Yeah, from giving plasma.

376
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,800
- Or I think I would be embarrassed

377
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:52,200
at how much they didn't want my blood.

378
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:54,760
- Yeah, how do you give plasma?

379
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:55,920
- This shit sucks.

380
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:57,200
There's a bunch of places.

381
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:59,360
You can give it, but you can also sell it.

382
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:00,520
Yeah.

383
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:01,360
My grandpa--

384
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:03,880
If you live in a place where there's poor people,

385
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:06,200
you will find a place to sell plasma.

386
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:07,040
Yeah.

387
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:11,720
At the apartment I lived at in Tempe

388
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:14,560
when I first moved out on my own

389
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:17,000
and got a one bedroom apartment,

390
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,640
on the mail thing,

391
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:21,160
there would be three different types of posters.

392
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:25,780
There was posters for like attorneys,

393
00:16:25,780 --> 00:16:28,860
There was posters for selling plasma

394
00:16:28,860 --> 00:16:31,900
and there was posters for selling sperm.

395
00:16:31,900 --> 00:16:35,500
That was it.

396
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:38,480
- I tried to go sell my sperm one time

397
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:40,940
and then I gave up 'cause like as soon as I--

398
00:16:40,940 --> 00:16:42,360
- They need so much.

399
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:45,420
- Well, I like applied online

400
00:16:45,420 --> 00:16:49,460
and then they started sending me the questionnaire and shit.

401
00:16:49,460 --> 00:16:53,740
I was like, oh yeah, nobody wants like a five foot nine

402
00:16:53,740 --> 00:16:56,820
bald comedians come.

403
00:16:56,820 --> 00:16:59,460
Nobody's like paying for this.

404
00:16:59,460 --> 00:17:00,300
So then I tried to donate my shit.

405
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:02,340
- This is like the one woman that wants it.

406
00:17:02,340 --> 00:17:03,500
(laughs)

407
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:04,900
- I tried to do, yeah, Rex.

408
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:06,780
I tried to donate my shit though.

409
00:17:06,780 --> 00:17:07,700
- Boom.

410
00:17:07,700 --> 00:17:09,060
- I tried to sell my shit.

411
00:17:09,060 --> 00:17:10,620
Yeah, 'cause they do shit.

412
00:17:10,620 --> 00:17:13,500
They do shit transplants for people with C. difficile

413
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:16,580
where they may have to make a poop smoothie.

414
00:17:16,580 --> 00:17:19,140
But then I also have very bad shit.

415
00:17:19,140 --> 00:17:19,980
- Awful poop.

416
00:17:19,980 --> 00:17:22,140
- I probably have C. difficile.

417
00:17:22,140 --> 00:17:24,180
So I didn't make any sense either.

418
00:17:24,180 --> 00:17:25,700
So now I don't know what to do.

419
00:17:25,700 --> 00:17:27,420
I have nothing to give.

420
00:17:27,420 --> 00:17:28,900
- I'm learning so much today.

421
00:17:28,900 --> 00:17:32,900
- Yeah, blood is like $75 per time.

422
00:17:32,900 --> 00:17:35,340
It may have changed.

423
00:17:35,340 --> 00:17:36,260
- But you can only do it like once

424
00:17:36,260 --> 00:17:37,300
every couple of weeks, right?

425
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:40,880
- Yeah, and sperm you can do two to three times a week,

426
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:42,140
but you have to like,

427
00:17:42,140 --> 00:17:44,900
that's assuming you're like not having sex,

428
00:17:44,900 --> 00:17:47,960
not jacking off at all in between,

429
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:51,260
to like fill up the load cup.

430
00:17:51,260 --> 00:17:52,560
Is that what you have to do?

431
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:55,140
Like a thing like they just like get your profile

432
00:17:55,140 --> 00:18:00,140
and then they do like a make to order type of thing

433
00:18:00,140 --> 00:18:01,240
where they like call you like,

434
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:03,140
all right, yeah, someone wants your shit.

435
00:18:03,140 --> 00:18:05,980
No, I think they put it into a freezer, I believe.

436
00:18:05,980 --> 00:18:08,620
Yeah, you need to give them like

437
00:18:08,620 --> 00:18:11,600
your ancestry.com information.

438
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:14,140
You gotta like give them like,

439
00:18:14,140 --> 00:18:17,340
you gotta have no familial like mental illness

440
00:18:17,340 --> 00:18:20,900
or cancer or dementia or anything like that.

441
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:23,500
-Maybe you have to be somebody that doesn't need the money

442
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:24,500
to give sperm.

443
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:25,220
-Right.

444
00:18:25,220 --> 00:18:29,180
You need to be not retarded, hot, tall.

445
00:18:29,180 --> 00:18:32,980
And I don't know what person would find themselves

446
00:18:32,980 --> 00:18:35,180
in that situation.

447
00:18:35,180 --> 00:18:38,060
-Do you think you could ever just give them a mixture?

448
00:18:38,060 --> 00:18:40,100
Just sneak in a little bottle--

449
00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:42,860
-Yeah, it's a mystery box that they've fucking scraped out

450
00:18:42,860 --> 00:18:45,020
from the back of the freezer when it breaks.

451
00:18:45,020 --> 00:18:47,180
-Yeah, the cheap stuff should be that.

452
00:18:47,180 --> 00:18:49,500
The cheaper ones for ugly girls.

453
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:51,800
Yeah, you got no fucking clue.

454
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:52,800
Yeah. Yeah.

455
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:54,600
Yeah. I think we should start with that.

456
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:58,640
Well, did you see the doctor who was just putting his own cum in women

457
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:04,040
and then he made an airplane and then it broke in midair and he died?

458
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:08,240
No, but but OK, but here's my question.

459
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:11,400
What kind of woman doesn't want to marry a doctor?

460
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:15,660
That's a great point, you know, but he also

461
00:19:16,300 --> 00:19:22,460
He also made an airplane where the wings separated from it in midair and then crashed and died.

462
00:19:22,460 --> 00:19:24,140
So he wasn't that kind of doctor.

463
00:19:24,140 --> 00:19:28,140
He was an airplane doctor.

464
00:19:28,140 --> 00:19:29,620
He was a medical doctor.

465
00:19:29,620 --> 00:19:30,620
Right.

466
00:19:30,620 --> 00:19:33,260
Alright, that makes sense.

467
00:19:33,260 --> 00:19:34,260
Interesting.

468
00:19:34,260 --> 00:19:38,580
I mean, honestly, if my doctor died in midair in an airplane he created, I would question

469
00:19:38,580 --> 00:19:40,740
his ability to do surgery.

470
00:19:40,740 --> 00:19:41,740
I don't think he ever did.

471
00:19:41,740 --> 00:19:44,540
What do you mean he created an airplane?

472
00:19:44,540 --> 00:19:45,900
He built it himself.

473
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:48,700
Okay, Bill, why did you say "created it"?

474
00:19:48,700 --> 00:19:52,300
Well, I mean, that's what he did. It's like a fucking LEGO set.

475
00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:53,500
He created...

476
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:54,500
He created...

477
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:55,900
He built a LEGO set.

478
00:19:55,900 --> 00:19:59,700
No, you create a LEGO sculpture.

479
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:01,700
You create LEGO art.

480
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:02,700
That's not true.

481
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:04,500
LEGO TM bricks.

482
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:05,700
No.

483
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:06,900
You take...

484
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:10,100
You buy LEGO TM bricks...

485
00:20:10,100 --> 00:20:11,900
...and you assemble them...

486
00:20:11,900 --> 00:20:13,900
You're out of pocket, that's what you are.

487
00:20:13,900 --> 00:20:15,100
...into something.

488
00:20:15,100 --> 00:20:17,600
- Shut this woman up right now.

489
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:19,260
- What are you doing talking to a mirror?

490
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:20,100
Stop that.

491
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:22,620
- No.

492
00:20:22,620 --> 00:20:24,620
- That looks like the biggest beer of all time.

493
00:20:24,620 --> 00:20:25,460
It looks so big.

494
00:20:25,460 --> 00:20:26,300
- No it doesn't.

495
00:20:26,300 --> 00:20:27,260
- Yes it does.

496
00:20:27,260 --> 00:20:29,180
- No it's not that big.

497
00:20:29,180 --> 00:20:31,380
- Well next to your like baby head.

498
00:20:31,380 --> 00:20:32,400
Don't do that.

499
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:34,220
- Why?

500
00:20:34,220 --> 00:20:35,860
- You are disgusting.

501
00:20:35,860 --> 00:20:37,260
- Is that bad to do that?

502
00:20:37,260 --> 00:20:38,100
- Yeah.

503
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:43,820
- I should not be doing this to her.

504
00:20:43,820 --> 00:20:46,080
(laughing)

505
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:49,900
Okay, I'd like to, back to the task at hand

506
00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:51,700
of doing this show.

507
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:56,700
I would like to, first of all, the Celtics lost.

508
00:20:56,700 --> 00:21:00,140
Yeah.

509
00:21:00,140 --> 00:21:04,580
Because I had a perfectly placed reverse double curse.

510
00:21:04,580 --> 00:21:05,740
Yeah. Okay?

511
00:21:05,740 --> 00:21:10,740
So I am going to do a similar thing

512
00:21:11,580 --> 00:21:15,620
with the Miami Denver series right now.

513
00:21:15,620 --> 00:21:17,960
And I would like to say, Jimmy Butler,

514
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:21,320
you're the man, you're the champion,

515
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:23,860
you're gonna make 100 points a game.

516
00:21:23,860 --> 00:21:26,060
Keep it up big guy, and we'll see you there next year

517
00:21:26,060 --> 00:21:27,640
with a ring on your finger.

518
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:30,180
All right, that's the end of my little spiel.

519
00:21:30,180 --> 00:21:33,480
- Yeah, this is technically the Memorial Day episode,

520
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:35,580
I guess, Memorial Day was this week.

521
00:21:35,580 --> 00:21:37,420
- Oh man.

522
00:21:37,420 --> 00:21:39,600
Yeah.

523
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:43,860
All of us that have real jobs that need days off in that way.

524
00:21:43,860 --> 00:21:48,840
Yeah. All three of us, all three of us that celebrate Memorial Day.

525
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:52,540
I did Memorial Day over at Brian's house.

526
00:21:52,540 --> 00:21:55,900
Yeah, you and I. Yeah, we we together.

527
00:21:55,900 --> 00:22:00,360
Oh, yeah. I forgot you were there because you left and I played Mario Kart.

528
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:05,300
But yeah, and you weren't there for Mario Kart, which is kind of odd to me.

529
00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:08,840
Memorial Day underrated holiday.

530
00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:10,920
The last two Memorial days have been better

531
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:13,480
than my last two 4th of Julys,

532
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:15,320
and you can take that to the bank.

533
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:17,560
- Whoa. - July sucks.

534
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:18,920
Bullshit holiday.

535
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:21,920
- Isn't it just like kind of the same thing,

536
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:22,960
how you celebrate it?

537
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:24,920
- 4th of July?

538
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:27,840
- I know it's like two different holidays,

539
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:31,640
but you just go to a barbecue, like what's the difference?

540
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:34,480
- Well, 4th of July in New York City

541
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:37,200
is a unique kind of hell,

542
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:39,000
especially if you have a dog.

543
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:39,840
Oh, yeah.

544
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:42,340
And it's going to be three or four in the morning.

545
00:22:42,340 --> 00:22:45,440
You will hear fireworks going off all around you. Yeah.

546
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:49,580
And it might as well be

547
00:22:49,580 --> 00:22:52,280
this motherfucking country that's on this beer

548
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:55,780
when this shit starts popping off on July 4th and when.

549
00:22:55,780 --> 00:22:58,880
And maybe when you first moved to New York City,

550
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:01,740
you don't know that much about the fireworks stuff.

551
00:23:01,740 --> 00:23:06,440
And somebody started setting off fireworks in your neighborhood on July 2nd.

552
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:09,880
And you were in the middle of the shower and you thought it was gunshots

553
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:14,140
being shot into your building and you stayed in your bathroom for two hours.

554
00:23:14,140 --> 00:23:17,280
That's really embarrassing.

555
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:19,680
I would have ran at the gunman.

556
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:20,820
I would have been naked.

557
00:23:20,820 --> 00:23:22,320
Your mouth open.

558
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:24,940
Ah, ah, pointing in your mouth.

559
00:23:24,940 --> 00:23:27,680
I would have been jumping on the bullets

560
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:29,740
to save your the front of your building.

561
00:23:29,740 --> 00:23:30,640
Yep. I would have.

562
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:32,720
I would have jumped on them and made them die.

563
00:23:34,740 --> 00:23:35,740
I keep getting shocked.

564
00:23:35,740 --> 00:23:40,020
Isn't it like crazy illegal to like do fireworks instead of a city?

565
00:23:40,020 --> 00:23:44,240
Nobody gives a fuck about any fucking law in New York City, dude.

566
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:47,280
It's all I mean, it's nothing you can you can do.

567
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:48,180
You can do anything.

568
00:23:48,180 --> 00:23:49,620
There's you can do heroin.

569
00:23:49,620 --> 00:23:53,480
It's because they have cops for every specific like there's firework cops.

570
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:55,260
Is there really?

571
00:23:55,260 --> 00:23:59,600
I'm sure there's traffic cops, but then there's also parking cops.

572
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:02,360
But then there's also like every different kind of cop.

573
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:04,360
Guy cops, there's girl cops.

574
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:10,360
Girl cops only handle crimes with makeup and handbags and period stuff.

575
00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:13,360
Period blood. If they see blood on the street, they go up and they go, "Oh, okay."

576
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:18,360
And then they smell it and they go, "Oh no, this is not... Sorry, this is not my jurisdiction."

577
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:19,360
This clearly came from a body.

578
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:27,360
When we were at Brookland one night, I went into the bathroom and there was just period blood all over the toilet seat.

579
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:28,360
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

580
00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:29,360
What?

581
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:30,440
- Yep, no wait, hang on, hang on.

582
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:32,320
Before he finishes the story,

583
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:34,720
I want him to read through this

584
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:36,880
and phrase it the way he phrased it

585
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:38,320
when he told me and Noah, I think.

586
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:39,720
- I've read the poem, I said.

587
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:42,120
- He walks up to me and he goes like,

588
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:44,000
dude, I walked into the bathroom at Brooklyn

589
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,480
and there's completely like a girl having her period there.

590
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:48,040
I was like, whoa, what?

591
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:49,800
He just walked into someone having her period there?

592
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:51,160
He's like, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

593
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:52,280
There's just blood there.

594
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:54,800
I was like, oh, I don't care.

595
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:56,440
- I mean, it's disgusting,

596
00:24:56,440 --> 00:24:58,640
but being a girl having her period,

597
00:24:58,640 --> 00:24:59,640
It's a score.

598
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:00,640
You got, it's a score.

599
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:01,640
It's a score.

600
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:04,200
You got a third base.

601
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:09,640
I think I was a little drunk and I said, "Dude, there's some bitch having her pussy all over

602
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:12,080
the toilet seat."

603
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:13,120
That's more disgusting.

604
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:18,480
The way you phrased it is worse than putting your bloody, whatever it's called.

605
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:19,480
Yeah, you must apologize.

606
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:24,900
Yeah, I do feel like, because gamer guys are disgusting.

607
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:30,300
A gamer girl is like filth, just like pure trash.

608
00:25:30,300 --> 00:25:32,180
A lot of people don't even go there.

609
00:25:32,180 --> 00:25:34,100
A lot of people just go there for the bar part, though.

610
00:25:34,100 --> 00:25:36,700
So it could be just so.

611
00:25:36,700 --> 00:25:38,700
Yeah, it's very funny.

612
00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:40,900
Yeah, I like Flores.

613
00:25:40,900 --> 00:25:43,780
Yeah. Telling a girl like, yeah, I got a I got a place for you.

614
00:25:43,780 --> 00:25:48,540
You have to go on like tonight and then you're ordering the princess peach.

615
00:25:48,540 --> 00:25:50,900
Yeah, that's so cool.

616
00:25:50,900 --> 00:25:54,440
But I'm going to order you the blue shell.

617
00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:57,640
I think we've ever ordered one of those like gay drinks.

618
00:25:57,640 --> 00:25:59,240
I've never gotten one of the cocktails.

619
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:02,640
Which is just going, which is like, yeah, I'll just like a Bud Light or whatever.

620
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:06,740
Yeah, I mean, they're just because they're expensive and I'm sure they're so fucking bad.

621
00:26:06,740 --> 00:26:07,840
Yeah.

622
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:09,840
Speaking of...

623
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:13,340
Remember the tequila shot there was like paint thinner, dude.

624
00:26:13,340 --> 00:26:16,040
Yeah, yeah, it's gas.

625
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:21,940
Speaking of Brooklyn, last time we were there, I fully ripped the fucking crotch of these jeans open.

626
00:26:21,940 --> 00:26:24,540
I didn't have any underwear on and my balls were hanging out.

627
00:26:24,540 --> 00:26:26,800
(laughing)

628
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:29,280
- Yeah, you guys are not disgusting.

629
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:31,080
- No, dude, we're good guys.

630
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:32,600
- Wait, how did you do this?

631
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:34,800
- I don't even know, I just was sitting there

632
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:37,300
and I was like, "God, it's cold in here."

633
00:26:37,300 --> 00:26:41,140
And then I kind of looked like I was fingering,

634
00:26:41,140 --> 00:26:44,400
like if my jeans were my skin and I was a woman,

635
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:46,640
it's exactly where my pussy would be.

636
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:50,340
- So, this was when we had a party with seven people

637
00:26:50,340 --> 00:26:52,260
at the Brooklyn thing?

638
00:26:52,260 --> 00:26:54,180
- Yeah, and then I was just like,

639
00:26:54,180 --> 00:26:56,140
"All right, whatever, I'm just gonna park it here

640
00:26:56,140 --> 00:26:58,180
"and just fucking, if it gets worse,

641
00:26:58,180 --> 00:27:00,040
"I'll walk over to the place next door

642
00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:01,120
"and get a new pair of pants,

643
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:03,260
"or I'll send one of you guys over

644
00:27:03,260 --> 00:27:04,720
"and I'll hide the bathroom."

645
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:09,580
But I didn't come to that, and I'm still wearing them.

646
00:27:09,580 --> 00:27:11,580
But now I know to wear underwear with them.

647
00:27:11,580 --> 00:27:12,500
(laughing)

648
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:14,660
'Cause if I had just fully ripped my pants open

649
00:27:14,660 --> 00:27:16,580
and my asshole and balls were out.

650
00:27:16,580 --> 00:27:19,020
- I think you're like the one person in the world

651
00:27:19,020 --> 00:27:21,900
that I just keep hearing stories about how

652
00:27:21,900 --> 00:27:24,380
your balls keep just like flying out of your pants.

653
00:27:24,380 --> 00:27:25,220
- My pills.

654
00:27:25,220 --> 00:27:26,060
- Because you're--

655
00:27:26,060 --> 00:27:28,740
(laughing)

656
00:27:28,740 --> 00:27:29,860
- My pills.

657
00:27:29,860 --> 00:27:33,780
- You're just never, ever wearing underwear.

658
00:27:33,780 --> 00:27:35,220
- You know what it is?

659
00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:36,060
Okay.

660
00:27:36,060 --> 00:27:38,500
You know what it is?

661
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:42,020
I don't, in the mornings, when I take the dog out,

662
00:27:42,020 --> 00:27:43,220
I roll out of bed.

663
00:27:43,220 --> 00:27:48,620
I just put on whatever pair of pants, go commando.

664
00:27:48,620 --> 00:27:49,900
- Why? - I get changed

665
00:27:49,900 --> 00:27:52,200
for the rest of the day later.

666
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:55,480
- You go Winnie the Pooh in the bed?

667
00:27:55,480 --> 00:27:58,200
- Yeah, I go Winnie the Pooh in the bed.

668
00:27:58,200 --> 00:27:59,040
- Okay.

669
00:27:59,040 --> 00:28:02,320
- And then I get, and then I go outside

670
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:04,960
and then I come back in and then usually I get changed,

671
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:06,480
but every once in a while, maybe once a week,

672
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:09,520
once every two weeks, I go commando for the whole day

673
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:12,240
'cause something grabs me right as I get inside.

674
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:13,080
- Right.

675
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:17,800
Such as going to a completely different part of the city.

676
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:22,680
No, I think actually that day was because I was out of clean underwear.

677
00:28:22,680 --> 00:28:25,880
OK, I wear dirty underwear.

678
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:27,240
I guess that makes sense.

679
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:30,780
Because because trust me, my dirty underwear are dirty.

680
00:28:30,780 --> 00:28:34,620
I stink them up, I shit in them.

681
00:28:34,620 --> 00:28:38,080
I use them to wipe my ass.

682
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:40,060
They're not a good thing to have.

683
00:28:40,060 --> 00:28:43,960
You can't I never worn underwear twice.

684
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:46,600
It's it would be impossible.

685
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:47,600
Yeah, we have to completely fix that.

686
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:49,600
There's literally something wrong with you.

687
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:51,440
Why is there something wrong with me?

688
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:52,440
You wear underwear twice?

689
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:53,440
Sure.

690
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:54,440
Oh, God!

691
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:58,000
What is wrong with you?

692
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,640
I wear underwear all the time, dude.

693
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:01,640
Twice?

694
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:03,760
One pair you'll wear twice before washing it?

695
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:05,800
I mean, I'll wear it until...

696
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:06,800
Oh, it's a yes!

697
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:07,800
Oh, he's disgusting!

698
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:08,800
I don't even want to see...

699
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:11,480
I'll wear it until I change them to a different pair.

700
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:12,480
I don't want you to see me.

701
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:15,480
Sometimes that's like an hour, and sometimes...

702
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:22,480
What are you doing with these underwear in one hour?

703
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:25,800
That is worse than anything Caleb just said.

704
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:26,800
An hour?

705
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:27,800
What are you doing in an hour?

706
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:32,440
You just showered, you just got changed, what are you doing in an hour?

707
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:37,060
It turns out I don't have enough time to shower so I just swap the underwear out for some

708
00:29:37,060 --> 00:29:42,120
cleaner ones, go walk around for a bit, come back, then I shower.

709
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:44,000
Oh, okay.

710
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,860
That's weird.

711
00:29:45,860 --> 00:29:46,860
That is weird.

712
00:29:46,860 --> 00:29:47,860
No, it's not.

713
00:29:47,860 --> 00:29:52,100
I mean, your nuts and your butthole still stink like shit if you've been...

714
00:29:52,100 --> 00:29:54,260
First of all, my asshole is clean as a whistle.

715
00:29:54,260 --> 00:29:56,180
I have a bidet.

716
00:29:56,180 --> 00:29:57,940
That's true.

717
00:29:57,940 --> 00:30:00,700
Not in New York City where you just were.

718
00:30:00,700 --> 00:30:01,740
That is true.

719
00:30:01,740 --> 00:30:04,020
And that's why I did not...

720
00:30:04,020 --> 00:30:05,020
We had wet wipes.

721
00:30:05,020 --> 00:30:07,020
We did have wet wipes.

722
00:30:07,020 --> 00:30:08,700
You're not animals.

723
00:30:08,700 --> 00:30:13,500
I did shit before I showered almost every time.

724
00:30:13,500 --> 00:30:14,760
- In proper order. - Yeah.

725
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:15,780
I would hope so.

726
00:30:15,780 --> 00:30:18,580
- Oh, he's got us. - You don't shower.

727
00:30:18,580 --> 00:30:19,900
You don't shower before you shit.

728
00:30:19,900 --> 00:30:21,800
- Well, I mean, not intentionally.

729
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:23,000
Yeah, not intentionally.

730
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:26,020
You're saying you never shit after a shower?

731
00:30:26,020 --> 00:30:27,980
You've never been in the shower

732
00:30:27,980 --> 00:30:32,020
and the warmth, the beautiful comfort

733
00:30:32,020 --> 00:30:35,540
releases the chemicals into your brain

734
00:30:35,540 --> 00:30:37,540
that makes you need to shit?

735
00:30:37,540 --> 00:30:40,620
- You're making it sound like really pleasant,

736
00:30:40,620 --> 00:30:43,140
but if I'm ever in the situation where I'm taking a shower

737
00:30:43,140 --> 00:30:44,460
and I feel like taking a shit,

738
00:30:44,460 --> 00:30:46,700
it's probably like the worst day of my life

739
00:30:46,700 --> 00:30:49,180
because it feels like I wanna spend an hour in the bathroom.

740
00:30:49,180 --> 00:30:51,580
- You know, I've heard multiple people now,

741
00:30:51,580 --> 00:30:53,500
and adults, mind you,

742
00:30:53,500 --> 00:30:58,860
tell me that they will take a shit,

743
00:30:58,860 --> 00:31:01,380
not wipe their ass,

744
00:31:01,380 --> 00:31:05,280
and then get into the shower and wash their poopy asshole.

745
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:07,900
Without wiping.

746
00:31:07,900 --> 00:31:11,560
And every single person who's ever told me this

747
00:31:11,560 --> 00:31:12,620
has had a roommate.

748
00:31:12,620 --> 00:31:15,060
who they share a shower with.

749
00:31:15,060 --> 00:31:17,060
So they're putting poo-poo in the shower

750
00:31:17,060 --> 00:31:18,600
that they share with their roommate.

751
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:20,580
- I mean, that's fine, it's clean down there.

752
00:31:20,580 --> 00:31:22,780
- That's disgusting, you are a disgusting monkey

753
00:31:22,780 --> 00:31:24,140
if you think that's okay to do.

754
00:31:24,140 --> 00:31:26,020
- I mean, I would never do that, but.

755
00:31:26,020 --> 00:31:31,420
- I think the proper order would be to at least dry wipe

756
00:31:31,420 --> 00:31:33,060
and then step directly into the shower

757
00:31:33,060 --> 00:31:35,740
and then just put the water in your ass.

758
00:31:35,740 --> 00:31:38,660
- I took a shit in the shower earlier today.

759
00:31:38,660 --> 00:31:40,360
I did my ass.

760
00:31:40,360 --> 00:31:42,960
But I did not.

761
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:44,760
Wipe it down.

762
00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:47,560
If it's still a little wet and I just bought directly.

763
00:31:47,560 --> 00:31:51,660
We have a bidet that's different for sure.

764
00:31:51,660 --> 00:31:52,560
Yeah.

765
00:31:52,560 --> 00:31:54,860
It was good.

766
00:31:54,860 --> 00:31:55,460
It's this

767
00:31:55,460 --> 00:31:59,640
popping into the shower with an already wet ass is kind of a

768
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:00,260
crazy.

769
00:32:00,260 --> 00:32:02,160
It's not that crazy.

770
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:03,160
It's not that crazy.

771
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:04,960
That's got to feel crazy to be getting in there.

772
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:09,280
It was a crazy shit that required taking the shirt off.

773
00:32:09,280 --> 00:32:10,600
I'm still anti it.

774
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:12,840
You know, people say that I've never had that.

775
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:15,080
I've never had a no shirt shit.

776
00:32:15,080 --> 00:32:18,920
Why not, dude?

777
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:20,600
You're clearly not enjoying shit.

778
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:22,760
Sometimes you just need to take your shirt off.

779
00:32:22,760 --> 00:32:23,600
It gets hot.

780
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:29,240
You're like an engine that's been running too hot.

781
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:32,200
Do you ever squeeze, if you get hot while you're shitting,

782
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:34,800
do you ever squirt the bidet just to cool yourself off

783
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:36,800
like a Gatorade in the middle of your shit.

784
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:37,300
No, dude, it's up top.

785
00:32:37,300 --> 00:32:39,560
It's up here where it gets hot.

786
00:32:39,560 --> 00:32:40,800
I'm like having a head rush.

787
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:44,140
But wouldn't it be a little refreshing halfway through a shit?

788
00:32:44,140 --> 00:32:45,600
It does feel good.

789
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:47,760
I have to have that.

790
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:50,260
Especially like a dual flusher.

791
00:32:50,260 --> 00:32:51,560
I will squirt.

792
00:32:51,560 --> 00:32:53,140
What's a dual flusher?

793
00:32:53,140 --> 00:32:59,860
Oh, you mean the shit where you have to flush twice.

794
00:32:59,860 --> 00:33:02,200
OK.

795
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:03,480
OK.

796
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:05,480
Now I understand, a dual flusher.

797
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:06,480
A dual flusher.

798
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:12,480
Remember that B-Reel that you took where you almost pussied your dick into the toilet?

799
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:19,480
Did you take one where you almost pussied your dick?

800
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:24,480
Yeah, I was taking a shit and I was in the bathroom.

801
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:27,480
You did a B-Reel where you're shitting?

802
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:30,480
I wanted to be on time, dude.

803
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:33,480
That's the realest shower ever.

804
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:35,480
(laughter)

805
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:37,480
(laughter)

806
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:39,480
I just kinda had my arm

807
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:41,480
like down here like this.

808
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:43,480
For our listeners,

809
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:45,480
the way Rex's bathroom works is

810
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:47,480
the door has a mirror

811
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:49,480
at the back of it and the

812
00:33:49,480 --> 00:33:51,480
door is rarely in front of his toilet.

813
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:53,480
So, he

814
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:55,480
he gets the

815
00:33:55,480 --> 00:33:57,480
notification sound

816
00:33:57,480 --> 00:33:59,480
it's time to be real and he decides

817
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:03,480
be the realest that he's ever been in his entire life. The realest motherfucker on the planet.

818
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:11,000
Okay, so let me explain this. I went to go take the photo and I was like, oh wait,

819
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:16,280
the mirror, like I can't take a mirror selfie, that would be insane. I'm shitting,

820
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:21,560
they'd see my penis. Let me just take a front-facing selfie of myself on the toilet,

821
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:25,160
they won't see anyone. They forgot it takes the photo from behind.

822
00:34:25,160 --> 00:34:27,420
(laughter)

823
00:34:27,420 --> 00:34:33,280
- Not for the grace of God that I just was a knuckle

824
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:36,440
dragger at that moment and had my arm covering my penis.

825
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:39,560
I absolutely would have posted my dick on B-roll.

826
00:34:39,560 --> 00:34:40,800
- Oh my God.

827
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:46,540
- You also would have, you can do a retake.

828
00:34:46,540 --> 00:34:48,680
- I didn't look at it before I posted it.

829
00:34:48,680 --> 00:34:50,080
- He just let it fly.

830
00:34:50,080 --> 00:34:52,400
- I let it fly, I didn't think about it too hard.

831
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:53,240
- You know what?

832
00:34:53,240 --> 00:34:55,520
- They're getting the realest motherfucker on earth.

833
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:56,360
He's not gonna check the B-Rio.

834
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:57,960
- They should give you the word for being the most real.

835
00:34:57,960 --> 00:34:59,680
- Yeah, they honestly, you should get like

836
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:02,960
a YouTube play button for B-Rio.

837
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:03,800
- Yeah. - Yeah.

838
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:05,820
- Or at least a coffee mug.

839
00:35:05,820 --> 00:35:08,840
- I was in a beautiful moment.

840
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:11,480
I didn't realize what happened until Julio was like,

841
00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:14,840
did you just post your fucking dick on B-Rio?

842
00:35:14,840 --> 00:35:16,520
(laughing)

843
00:35:16,520 --> 00:35:20,800
- I think about posting my balls online all the time,

844
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:21,640
or my asshole.

845
00:35:21,640 --> 00:35:22,460
- Why?

846
00:35:22,460 --> 00:35:24,340
- I just think it'd be funny,

847
00:35:24,340 --> 00:35:26,620
I mean it's just funny that I can make

848
00:35:26,620 --> 00:35:29,120
thousands of people see my asshole if I wanted to.

849
00:35:29,120 --> 00:35:31,340
That's funny.

850
00:35:31,340 --> 00:35:33,940
- I know you're addicted to showing your balls to people.

851
00:35:33,940 --> 00:35:35,140
That was one thing you told me when we--

852
00:35:35,140 --> 00:35:38,500
- Whoa, don't go around saying I'm addicted

853
00:35:38,500 --> 00:35:40,340
to showing my balls to people.

854
00:35:40,340 --> 00:35:41,180
I'm gonna open up this.

855
00:35:41,180 --> 00:35:43,500
- Especially strangers, especially women on the street.

856
00:35:43,500 --> 00:35:45,060
- No, no, no, no.

857
00:35:45,060 --> 00:35:46,420
- This is not cold enough.

858
00:35:46,420 --> 00:35:48,300
- Me and Patrick have a-- - I need to make this cold enough.

859
00:35:48,300 --> 00:35:52,140
- Have a dick and balls war that we've been in

860
00:35:52,140 --> 00:35:54,140
for about four years now.

861
00:35:54,140 --> 00:35:59,540
But for showing or for like sack tapping showing

862
00:35:59,540 --> 00:36:01,140
showing each other.

863
00:36:01,140 --> 00:36:04,740
It started with one time we were at a bar and

864
00:36:04,740 --> 00:36:10,740
I took his phone or he I took his phone and I took a bunch of pictures of my

865
00:36:10,740 --> 00:36:16,040
dick in the bathroom while I was pissing and then I brought it back and I was like,

866
00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:17,640
hey man, you left your phone in the bathroom.

867
00:36:17,640 --> 00:36:18,940
He's like, oh, thanks.

868
00:36:19,340 --> 00:36:21,140
And there's a bunch of pictures of my dick

869
00:36:21,140 --> 00:36:22,640
missing into the toilet.

870
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:24,540
(laughing)

871
00:36:24,540 --> 00:36:26,540
- That's the gayest thing I've ever heard.

872
00:36:26,540 --> 00:36:28,680
(laughing)

873
00:36:28,680 --> 00:36:31,680
- He said it was the reddest dick he's ever seen in his life.

874
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:33,720
(laughing)

875
00:36:33,720 --> 00:36:37,580
- All right, I'm drinking Lagunitas Tiki Fusion

876
00:36:37,580 --> 00:36:41,580
zombie cocktail inspired IPA, hazy IPA

877
00:36:41,580 --> 00:36:44,280
with notes of orange, lime, grapefruit, and allspice.

878
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:48,860
And I hate to say it, this is a 10% beer.

879
00:36:48,860 --> 00:36:51,000
- You are going to die. - Which I did not know

880
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:51,840
when I bought it.

881
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:53,280
Let's just take a little sip.

882
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:54,220
- If you were to take a swig,

883
00:36:54,220 --> 00:36:57,040
I'd just completely fall asleep immediately.

884
00:36:57,040 --> 00:36:58,960
- Oh my God, it's amazing.

885
00:36:58,960 --> 00:36:59,800
- Yeah.

886
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:02,060
- How do you guys feel about Lagunitas?

887
00:37:02,060 --> 00:37:03,120
Have you had Lagunitas?

888
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:04,280
- Good, yeah.

889
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:05,120
- A little something, a little something.

890
00:37:05,120 --> 00:37:06,800
- I used to drink it. - I have.

891
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:08,200
- I used to drink a little,

892
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:11,960
me and Neil used to split a six pack of fucking Lagunitas

893
00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:15,120
every night pretty much in college.

894
00:37:15,120 --> 00:37:16,800
But for me, I had spent,

895
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:18,800
Neil didn't eat much and he was skinny.

896
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:23,140
And that's three IPAs from Lagunitas,

897
00:37:23,140 --> 00:37:25,140
probably about 900 calories.

898
00:37:25,140 --> 00:37:26,140
Yeah.

899
00:37:26,140 --> 00:37:28,140
And I didn't really know how to drink.

900
00:37:28,140 --> 00:37:30,140
I was pretty new to drinking in college.

901
00:37:30,140 --> 00:37:32,140
I didn't really think of it as calories or anything.

902
00:37:32,140 --> 00:37:34,140
So I would spend all day eating McDonald's

903
00:37:34,140 --> 00:37:36,140
and French fries and barbecue wings

904
00:37:36,140 --> 00:37:38,140
and then I would get home and drink about 1,000 calories

905
00:37:38,140 --> 00:37:40,140
worth of beer every night.

906
00:37:40,140 --> 00:37:42,140
[laughter]

907
00:37:42,140 --> 00:37:44,140
How did that make you feel?

908
00:37:44,140 --> 00:37:46,140
It made me feel fat.

909
00:37:46,140 --> 00:37:51,140
I very seldomly spring for an IPA, but I do like this one.

910
00:37:51,140 --> 00:37:54,640
And I always go, if I'm going to buy an IPA, I go Lagunitas for the most part.

911
00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:58,140
I think I need to get like a...

912
00:37:58,140 --> 00:37:59,140
Not a fan of IPAs.

913
00:37:59,140 --> 00:38:01,140
I need to order like an IPA case.

914
00:38:01,140 --> 00:38:03,140
Just to have like interesting beers.

915
00:38:03,140 --> 00:38:08,740
IPAs have really great, like, well...

916
00:38:08,740 --> 00:38:14,540
They have above average like art, and there's a lot of effort put into them.

917
00:38:14,740 --> 00:38:18,240
Sometimes they're called, you know, fuck ass shit ale.

918
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:20,340
And that shit's funny.

919
00:38:20,340 --> 00:38:24,440
The dogfish, bitch, bitch,

920
00:38:24,440 --> 00:38:27,900
fuck you, asshole, motherfucker.

921
00:38:27,900 --> 00:38:29,280
That shit is funny.

922
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:31,100
The arrogant bastard.

923
00:38:31,100 --> 00:38:34,500
And they have the guy who did the fear and loathing in Las Vegas.

924
00:38:34,500 --> 00:38:36,500
Fucking yeah.

925
00:38:36,500 --> 00:38:39,080
Art do the thing.

926
00:38:39,080 --> 00:38:40,200
It's cool.

927
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:41,140
Yeah, we could do it.

928
00:38:41,140 --> 00:38:42,980
We could do it up here.

929
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:44,300
Easily.

930
00:38:44,300 --> 00:38:46,840
Beer, beer, you're drinking.

931
00:38:46,840 --> 00:38:51,360
Beer, you drank beer, you'll drink beer, you'll drink.

932
00:38:51,360 --> 00:38:52,760
You are about to drink.

933
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:56,200
That's I mean, we've talked about this, right?

934
00:38:56,200 --> 00:39:00,760
I don't think we've mentioned the name, but that that if any breweries

935
00:39:00,760 --> 00:39:07,240
micro or macro want to get in touch with us about doing a small batch thing

936
00:39:07,240 --> 00:39:10,600
or fuck it, maybe I'll just do some in my garage.

937
00:39:10,600 --> 00:39:11,660
Yeah.

938
00:39:11,660 --> 00:39:12,220
OK.

939
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:13,240
Yeah, we can do one of your...

940
00:39:13,240 --> 00:39:16,640
They're going to replace Bud Light with Beer You Drink Light.

941
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:17,640
Beer You Drink.

942
00:39:17,640 --> 00:39:21,040
Yeah, well, you do Beer You're Drinking and Beer You're Drinking Light.

943
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:23,040
You could have all sorts of...

944
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:26,040
And then it could be the style of the beer goes before the names.

945
00:39:26,040 --> 00:39:29,040
It could be IPA Beer You're Drinking, Sour Beer You're Drinking.

946
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:30,040
Yeah.

947
00:39:30,040 --> 00:39:31,040
Yeah.

948
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:32,040
That's a great idea.

949
00:39:32,040 --> 00:39:33,040
It is.

950
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:34,040
That is a great idea.

951
00:39:34,040 --> 00:39:35,040
It should be branded like IKEA furniture.

952
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:36,040
Yeah, it should be very...

953
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:39,040
Like just like plain block text.

954
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:40,040
Box water.

955
00:39:40,040 --> 00:39:41,040
Yeah.

956
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:45,420
but also it has cartoon versions of all of us and we're smoking weed and playing

957
00:39:45,420 --> 00:39:53,000
basketball yeah that's a good idea yeah I'm dunking Julio into the dunk me well

958
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:58,400
no my head's a basketball and you two are doing a tip-off yeah okay that's

959
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:04,360
like that's a good concept there's a raft that's throwing you in the air yeah yeah

960
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:08,920
it's drawn exactly like a like a Ben Garrison style like kind of political

961
00:40:08,920 --> 00:40:10,920
cartoon, where they have like giant heads,

962
00:40:10,920 --> 00:40:11,920
I was thinking airbrush.

963
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:14,020
That would be cool.

964
00:40:14,020 --> 00:40:14,920
Yeah.

965
00:40:14,920 --> 00:40:16,220
That would be actually really cool.

966
00:40:16,220 --> 00:40:17,220
Everything is labeled.

967
00:40:17,220 --> 00:40:18,720
Yeah, everything is perfectly labeled.

968
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:19,920
Basketball bald head.

969
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:20,720
Basketball.

970
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:21,220
Circle.

971
00:40:21,220 --> 00:40:22,420
Guy.

972
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:23,420
Periphery.

973
00:40:23,420 --> 00:40:24,520
Yes.

974
00:40:24,520 --> 00:40:25,120
Woke.

975
00:40:25,120 --> 00:40:25,520
Mexican.

976
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:26,020
Wokeism.

977
00:40:26,020 --> 00:40:26,920
Jew.

978
00:40:26,920 --> 00:40:27,620
Okay.

979
00:40:27,620 --> 00:40:30,520
Will we do the first, I mean, I guess that's the question now

980
00:40:30,520 --> 00:40:33,420
that beer is kind of the forefront of the culture, where

981
00:40:33,420 --> 00:40:37,220
if, is, are we going to do a woke beer or an anti-woke beer?

982
00:40:38,120 --> 00:40:40,000
- I think we should do one of those things

983
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,880
where we're just like, we're straddling the line.

984
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:44,800
We're like really booking fun,

985
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:47,920
and like, "Oh, this is so silly," on our Twitter account.

986
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:52,920
But we keep releasing LGBTQ pride beers every single month.

987
00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:55,320
- Or we should do the opposite.

988
00:40:55,320 --> 00:41:00,160
Where we are like on--

989
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:04,600
- Oh, woke on Twitter, and then the cap is a red baseball cap.

990
00:41:04,600 --> 00:41:06,920
- Or we're doing all the same donations

991
00:41:06,920 --> 00:41:12,680
Chick-fil-A and shit. We're like giving money to like the conversion therapy places and stuff.

992
00:41:12,680 --> 00:41:21,160
But on Twitter, we're doing like the, what's that shit called? The meat steak-ems shit.

993
00:41:21,160 --> 00:41:24,600
You know, all that kind of stuff. Yeah. Okay.

994
00:41:24,600 --> 00:41:29,560
It's a good idea. I think Woke is coming back. We should do Woke.

995
00:41:29,560 --> 00:41:33,960
I agree. I think for a little bit, the stocks on Woke were way low.

996
00:41:33,960 --> 00:41:34,600
Low. But now...

997
00:41:34,600 --> 00:41:35,480
It's coming back.

998
00:41:35,480 --> 00:41:37,620
It's going right back up, so I'd like to say that.

999
00:41:37,620 --> 00:41:40,580
Where I'm I'm all in on woke.

1000
00:41:40,580 --> 00:41:41,380
I'm all in.

1001
00:41:41,380 --> 00:41:44,020
I look I want to be woke as can be.

1002
00:41:44,020 --> 00:41:45,880
And he woke is the new woke.

1003
00:41:45,880 --> 00:41:46,820
It's gay.

1004
00:41:46,820 --> 00:41:47,920
Yeah, exactly.

1005
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:50,320
And I can't even say that it's it's

1006
00:41:50,320 --> 00:41:53,620
it's a head fuck ass.

1007
00:41:53,620 --> 00:41:56,420
Yeah, it's garbage.

1008
00:41:56,420 --> 00:41:58,520
Yeah. What is God?

1009
00:41:58,520 --> 00:41:59,380
It's gay.

1010
00:41:59,380 --> 00:42:00,520
It's lesbian.

1011
00:42:00,520 --> 00:42:02,220
It's it's hot.

1012
00:42:02,220 --> 00:42:04,040
I mean, you can't say it's lame.

1013
00:42:04,040 --> 00:42:06,440
It's a yes. Yeah, you can't even say lame.

1014
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:09,840
Yeah, I mean, it's definitely hard to say to us to be woke.

1015
00:42:09,840 --> 00:42:12,520
You can't even say dog and cat in woke ism.

1016
00:42:12,520 --> 00:42:14,280
So I can't.

1017
00:42:14,280 --> 00:42:18,020
I apparently not according to my dogs or men and cat or my guess.

1018
00:42:18,020 --> 00:42:19,420
Talk about it.

1019
00:42:19,420 --> 00:42:21,580
According to you, according to my guess,

1020
00:42:21,580 --> 00:42:28,380
according to what I think, according to my what I'm thinking.

1021
00:42:28,380 --> 00:42:30,740
Yeah, you can't even say dogs or cats.

1022
00:42:30,740 --> 00:42:32,540
You have to call them.

1023
00:42:32,540 --> 00:42:33,540
- I'm not a...

1024
00:42:33,540 --> 00:42:35,780
(laughing)

1025
00:42:35,780 --> 00:42:36,620
- Tailed fellows.

1026
00:42:36,620 --> 00:42:37,460
- Two pets.

1027
00:42:37,460 --> 00:42:39,700
(laughing)

1028
00:42:39,700 --> 00:42:41,860
- You're a...

1029
00:42:41,860 --> 00:42:45,060
- Y'all are tailed fellows, better listen up.

1030
00:42:45,060 --> 00:42:47,140
- No, I actually do like wokeism though,

1031
00:42:47,140 --> 00:42:50,460
and I think the police should be enforcing it.

1032
00:42:50,460 --> 00:42:55,740
- Yeah, I think I'm gonna step in here and say

1033
00:42:55,740 --> 00:42:57,980
that all this culture war shit,

1034
00:42:57,980 --> 00:43:00,260
I think it's complete bullshit.

1035
00:43:00,260 --> 00:43:01,080
I spent--

1036
00:43:01,080 --> 00:43:01,920
- Get out of town.

1037
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:03,920
I don't have like an epic.

1038
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:04,920
Shut up, bitch!

1039
00:43:04,920 --> 00:43:06,920
Okay, that's my epic sound drop.

1040
00:43:06,920 --> 00:43:07,920
Come on, man.

1041
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:08,920
No, no, no, no, no.

1042
00:43:08,920 --> 00:43:19,060
I just spent 10 days in the US and not once did I see a woke or anti-woke sentiment type

1043
00:43:19,060 --> 00:43:21,580
action in my entire stay.

1044
00:43:21,580 --> 00:43:28,060
You didn't see one of those, oh, I saw a guy today walking around Brooklyn with SS bolts

1045
00:43:28,060 --> 00:43:31,460
tattooed all over his neck and he had one of those fucking skull and cross

1046
00:43:31,460 --> 00:43:33,900
was Nazi skull and crossbones in the middle of his throat.

1047
00:43:33,900 --> 00:43:36,000
And here's the best part.

1048
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,640
And then he walked into your apartment and started to do this podcast.

1049
00:43:38,640 --> 00:43:43,180
All right.

1050
00:43:43,180 --> 00:43:45,340
You're going to miss out on the funniest punch line of all time

1051
00:43:45,340 --> 00:43:46,380
that I had about this guy.

1052
00:43:46,380 --> 00:43:48,640
But can you please tell me the punch line?

1053
00:43:48,640 --> 00:43:51,380
OK, so guy has SS bolts

1054
00:43:51,380 --> 00:43:55,380
clearly like both sides of his neck, SS bolts.

1055
00:43:55,380 --> 00:43:58,020
He's got the skull and crossbones.

1056
00:43:58,020 --> 00:43:59,340
but on his head,

1057
00:43:59,340 --> 00:44:01,920
do-rag,

1058
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:05,420
Dominican flag.

1059
00:44:05,420 --> 00:44:06,260
- Okay.

1060
00:44:06,260 --> 00:44:07,620
- The guy was a Dominican guy,

1061
00:44:07,620 --> 00:44:09,660
walking around with like white supremacist

1062
00:44:09,660 --> 00:44:11,580
prison tattoos all over his head.

1063
00:44:11,580 --> 00:44:12,620
- That makes sense.

1064
00:44:12,620 --> 00:44:13,460
- Yeah.

1065
00:44:13,460 --> 00:44:14,580
- How does that make fucking sense?

1066
00:44:14,580 --> 00:44:15,660
That's crazy.

1067
00:44:15,660 --> 00:44:16,480
- I don't know.

1068
00:44:16,480 --> 00:44:18,060
- He went for the la raza.

1069
00:44:18,060 --> 00:44:19,780
- What are you talking about?

1070
00:44:19,780 --> 00:44:23,220
- Even if you're white,

1071
00:44:23,220 --> 00:44:27,300
whenever I drive past like poor neighborhoods in Mexico,

1072
00:44:27,300 --> 00:44:29,300
I see swastika, graffiti.

1073
00:44:29,300 --> 00:44:30,680
- Oh, that is so funny.

1074
00:44:30,680 --> 00:44:31,520
- That is dope.

1075
00:44:31,520 --> 00:44:32,880
- Oh, graffiti is different.

1076
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:36,300
If you saw like flags, I would be like,

1077
00:44:36,300 --> 00:44:38,120
every, I feel like swastika.

1078
00:44:38,120 --> 00:44:43,120
- I saw a flag once in like a really popular market, but.

1079
00:44:43,120 --> 00:44:46,680
(laughing)

1080
00:44:46,680 --> 00:44:50,740
- There was a Mexican dude outside of Pizzeria Panina,

1081
00:44:50,740 --> 00:44:55,240
and he had like a skull tat that was literally

1082
00:44:55,240 --> 00:44:58,920
what I imagine the Mexican version of Mr. Cool Ice would be.

1083
00:44:58,920 --> 00:45:01,480
It's dope as fuck.

1084
00:45:01,480 --> 00:45:05,280
Was that the buff girl you saw?

1085
00:45:05,280 --> 00:45:06,280
Yeah.

1086
00:45:06,280 --> 00:45:12,280
It was Mr. Cool Ice but it had a mustache.

1087
00:45:12,280 --> 00:45:14,280
Oh yeah.

1088
00:45:14,280 --> 00:45:20,280
So it looked like them Wartos Megawiz skull.

1089
00:45:20,280 --> 00:45:21,280
Yeah it was dope.

1090
00:45:21,280 --> 00:45:23,280
That's cool.

1091
00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:29,480
You know what I'm not I'm not too big a fan of the the rocks method of picking up.

1092
00:45:29,480 --> 00:45:31,480
Well it's time to open the Japanese one.

1093
00:45:31,480 --> 00:45:35,480
Um no it's not cold.

1094
00:45:35,480 --> 00:45:37,480
I'm gonna save it.

1095
00:45:37,480 --> 00:45:39,480
You can't save it.

1096
00:45:39,480 --> 00:45:41,480
You already burned it on this episode.

1097
00:45:41,480 --> 00:45:43,480
No I didn't.

1098
00:45:43,480 --> 00:45:45,480
Yes you did we saw it motherfucker.

1099
00:45:45,480 --> 00:45:47,480
No I didn't.

1100
00:45:47,480 --> 00:45:49,480
What does it look like?

1101
00:45:49,480 --> 00:45:51,480
It's got an orange top and uh.

1102
00:45:51,480 --> 00:45:52,440
- It's just to add ice.

1103
00:45:52,440 --> 00:45:54,400
I know, okay.

1104
00:45:54,400 --> 00:45:55,600
I'm not getting more ice.

1105
00:45:55,600 --> 00:45:56,960
- You already have ice. - All right, that's fine.

1106
00:45:56,960 --> 00:45:58,640
- There was ice in the glass.

1107
00:45:58,640 --> 00:46:01,760
- Whoa. - So finish the drink.

1108
00:46:01,760 --> 00:46:04,320
- Look at how cloudy that looks.

1109
00:46:04,320 --> 00:46:05,360
- You just got fucking owned.

1110
00:46:05,360 --> 00:46:06,720
- It tastes bad.

1111
00:46:06,720 --> 00:46:10,480
- Guys, this is a Doritos.

1112
00:46:10,480 --> 00:46:11,600
- That's the different thing.

1113
00:46:11,600 --> 00:46:13,140
That's the soda, the sody.

1114
00:46:13,140 --> 00:46:16,120
- This is good.

1115
00:46:16,120 --> 00:46:18,760
It's really tough to get down though.

1116
00:46:18,760 --> 00:46:22,800
Like I, my taste buds can't tell that it's 10%,

1117
00:46:22,800 --> 00:46:24,840
but I feel like my body can.

1118
00:46:24,840 --> 00:46:28,440
Oh, this is, we should be reading

1119
00:46:28,440 --> 00:46:29,880
the descriptions on the show.

1120
00:46:29,880 --> 00:46:36,080
This is, people who work in beer need to die instantly.

1121
00:46:36,080 --> 00:46:38,560
A forewarning for your senses,

1122
00:46:38,560 --> 00:46:41,280
this exotic fusion of flavors has been crafted

1123
00:46:41,280 --> 00:46:45,280
to conjure cocktailian notes of orange juice,

1124
00:46:45,280 --> 00:46:47,560
fresh lime, grapefruit, and allspice,

1125
00:46:47,560 --> 00:46:51,080
and brewed without summoning any liquor spirits.

1126
00:46:51,080 --> 00:46:54,080
Our homage to the original zombie and tiki movement,

1127
00:46:54,080 --> 00:46:56,620
both created in our home state of California,

1128
00:46:56,620 --> 00:47:01,420
B-Y-O-T-U naturally, so bring your own tiny umbrella.

1129
00:47:01,420 --> 00:47:03,640
Cheers.

1130
00:47:03,640 --> 00:47:04,920
What does it mean, zombie?

1131
00:47:04,920 --> 00:47:06,060
- Cocktailian.

1132
00:47:06,060 --> 00:47:08,680
- Cocktailian zombies.

1133
00:47:08,680 --> 00:47:11,440
- I'm eating some cocktailian wieners right now.

1134
00:47:11,440 --> 00:47:12,480
- Come on.

1135
00:47:12,480 --> 00:47:17,000
- We should do a Only Local Viewers episode next week.

1136
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:18,180
I'm down to do that.

1137
00:47:18,180 --> 00:47:19,020
Sure.

1138
00:47:19,020 --> 00:47:21,560
Yeah, I'll just get some Mexican beer

1139
00:47:21,560 --> 00:47:23,940
and I'll be able to easily drink it.

1140
00:47:23,940 --> 00:47:25,540
You can do a Modelo?

1141
00:47:25,540 --> 00:47:27,120
Bullshit, no, I'm not gonna do a Modelo,

1142
00:47:27,120 --> 00:47:29,480
I'm gonna do a Carta Blanca.

1143
00:47:29,480 --> 00:47:30,640
What's a Carta Blanca?

1144
00:47:30,640 --> 00:47:32,840
Is that a one that they don't have up here?

1145
00:47:32,840 --> 00:47:34,400
It's a really popular beer.

1146
00:47:34,400 --> 00:47:36,600
I would assume that you guys would have it.

1147
00:47:36,600 --> 00:47:38,600
Maybe, I'm not sure. I've never heard of that.

1148
00:47:38,600 --> 00:47:41,440
It's a really popular beer. Modelo time.

1149
00:47:41,440 --> 00:47:44,120
Yeah, I'll probably do something,

1150
00:47:44,120 --> 00:47:45,960
I mean, probably every beer I've had up here

1151
00:47:45,960 --> 00:47:49,880
probably in New York. All the like shit ones in cans.

1152
00:47:49,880 --> 00:47:55,480
Yeah. Yeah. Those crazy ones that we were drinking last week were like put in the Bronx according

1153
00:47:55,480 --> 00:47:57,080
to the cans.

1154
00:47:57,080 --> 00:47:58,080
We need to get.

1155
00:47:58,080 --> 00:47:59,200
And they'll taste it so bad.

1156
00:47:59,200 --> 00:48:03,960
You know, going back to doing this on online, I'm fully convinced that we need to get a

1157
00:48:03,960 --> 00:48:11,840
full time beers we drink studio in Las Vegas where we fly out to once a month. We stay

1158
00:48:11,840 --> 00:48:13,380
- We stay for four days.

1159
00:48:13,380 --> 00:48:14,220
- We drink.

1160
00:48:14,220 --> 00:48:15,960
- We record one episode every day.

1161
00:48:15,960 --> 00:48:18,640
And we get fucked up.

1162
00:48:18,640 --> 00:48:19,520
- Okay.

1163
00:48:19,520 --> 00:48:21,800
- We do all of the stuff that us three like doing.

1164
00:48:21,800 --> 00:48:26,800
We drink, we gamble, we watch two movies every single day.

1165
00:48:26,800 --> 00:48:32,520
And we use a randomizer feature to decide the movies.

1166
00:48:32,520 --> 00:48:38,840
- I feel like that's so easily doable.

1167
00:48:38,840 --> 00:48:40,200
- Yeah.

1168
00:48:40,200 --> 00:48:45,800
I think we should do that, but we should record like a year's worth and force ourselves to just...

1169
00:48:45,800 --> 00:48:49,500
There's no way I could drink a year's worth of beer in one...

1170
00:48:49,500 --> 00:48:52,100
Any amount of time, even a year.

1171
00:48:52,100 --> 00:48:55,100
You can't drink 52 beers in a week?

1172
00:48:55,100 --> 00:48:58,500
I do two per episode, buddy.

1173
00:48:58,500 --> 00:49:01,600
Okay, you can't drink a hundred beers in a week?

1174
00:49:01,600 --> 00:49:03,500
How much do you think we drank this past week?

1175
00:49:03,500 --> 00:49:05,300
Not a hundred beers.

1176
00:49:05,300 --> 00:49:07,700
I think we drank about 200 beers.

1177
00:49:08,900 --> 00:49:11,900
Between all three of us, we probably drank,

1178
00:49:11,900 --> 00:49:15,220
if you count every drink as a beer,

1179
00:49:15,220 --> 00:49:17,500
every sip.

1180
00:49:17,500 --> 00:49:23,180
We probably drank 60 beers between the three of us.

1181
00:49:23,180 --> 00:49:25,860
Yeah, me and Rich were talking about this,

1182
00:49:25,860 --> 00:49:29,300
how we never ever drink when we're home.

1183
00:49:29,300 --> 00:49:29,940
Yeah.

1184
00:49:29,940 --> 00:49:32,140
And then we just go to New York and every single day we're like,

1185
00:49:32,140 --> 00:49:35,500
I don't know, let's just go hang out somewhere and just drink a beer.

1186
00:49:35,500 --> 00:49:37,460
It's fun, man.

1187
00:49:37,460 --> 00:49:38,820
Good and clean fun.

1188
00:49:38,820 --> 00:49:39,660
- I hate getting drunk. - It's so fun.

1189
00:49:39,660 --> 00:49:41,180
- I hate getting drunk. - We just like sit around

1190
00:49:41,180 --> 00:49:43,660
and just like play Mario Kart.

1191
00:49:43,660 --> 00:49:45,380
- But isn't that much more fun to do

1192
00:49:45,380 --> 00:49:50,340
if you're having just maybe 15 or 16 beers?

1193
00:49:50,340 --> 00:49:51,540
That's good.

1194
00:49:51,540 --> 00:49:52,380
- Yeah.

1195
00:49:52,380 --> 00:49:54,180
- It's so much fun. - I don't feel that way.

1196
00:49:54,180 --> 00:49:56,260
- We don't know anybody who likes smoking weed.

1197
00:49:56,260 --> 00:49:57,580
I don't like smoking weed.

1198
00:49:57,580 --> 00:49:58,420
- That is true, no one smokes weed.

1199
00:49:58,420 --> 00:50:02,480
- Jumio is a bit of a herb head.

1200
00:50:02,480 --> 00:50:03,320
- No.

1201
00:50:03,320 --> 00:50:04,900
- Yeah, yeah, you are, admit it.

1202
00:50:04,900 --> 00:50:06,780
- I think it's time for you to come clean

1203
00:50:06,780 --> 00:50:08,660
with your story about me smoking weed

1204
00:50:08,660 --> 00:50:12,020
at one time. I think I should debunk your own lie.

1205
00:50:12,020 --> 00:50:17,780
Here's what really happened. We were watching Mac and Devin go to high school. It's the

1206
00:50:17,780 --> 00:50:24,780
first time Juvio's ever left his home. He's in New York City. Him and Rex are at my apartment.

1207
00:50:24,780 --> 00:50:25,780
It's Noah.

1208
00:50:25,780 --> 00:50:28,620
No, not Rex. Sorry. Him and Noah are at my apartment. They're both staying there for

1209
00:50:28,620 --> 00:50:37,460
10 days. My wife hated me so much because we had two guys in our apartment every single

1210
00:50:37,460 --> 00:50:38,460
day.

1211
00:50:38,460 --> 00:50:46,260
One of them was a Mexican guy from the internet that you had never met before.

1212
00:50:46,260 --> 00:50:50,520
And anyway, we're watching Mac and Demi go to high school.

1213
00:50:50,520 --> 00:50:58,460
Me and Noah start smoking weed and we basically, we pin Jubio down.

1214
00:50:58,460 --> 00:51:00,740
We actually, okay, here's what happened.

1215
00:51:00,740 --> 00:51:02,300
Jubio said, "No, no, no, no, no.

1216
00:51:02,300 --> 00:51:03,300
I don't want to smoke weed.

1217
00:51:03,300 --> 00:51:05,260
Please, no, no, no, no, no, no, no."

1218
00:51:05,260 --> 00:51:09,560
We backed him up into a wall and then I pulled out four throwing knives and I threw them

1219
00:51:09,560 --> 00:51:14,460
so perfectly that they pinned each of his sleeves and both of his pant legs to the wall

1220
00:51:14,460 --> 00:51:16,820
so he couldn't move at all, right?

1221
00:51:16,820 --> 00:51:19,660
And I said, "Tough shit, buddy.

1222
00:51:19,660 --> 00:51:22,060
This is a one-way ticket to Toketown."

1223
00:51:22,060 --> 00:51:25,740
And I put the whatever it was, I don't even remember what we smoked out of.

1224
00:51:25,740 --> 00:51:26,740
It was a pen.

1225
00:51:26,740 --> 00:51:27,740
A pen.

1226
00:51:27,740 --> 00:51:32,300
I put it in your mouth and basically the rest is history.

1227
00:51:32,300 --> 00:51:33,300
Right.

1228
00:51:33,300 --> 00:51:35,580
- This story is never gonna come out truly.

1229
00:51:35,580 --> 00:51:37,140
- I don't honestly remember what happened.

1230
00:51:37,140 --> 00:51:38,980
I was fucking high, I mean I was high.

1231
00:51:38,980 --> 00:51:39,820
What happened?

1232
00:51:39,820 --> 00:51:43,100
- We can talk about that another day.

1233
00:51:43,100 --> 00:51:46,100
I think it's a funny thing to just like never really--

1234
00:51:46,100 --> 00:51:49,500
- Jubio claims he didn't get high, but he got fucked up.

1235
00:51:49,500 --> 00:51:50,420
- Not true.

1236
00:51:50,420 --> 00:51:53,100
- He got fucked up, he was crying.

1237
00:51:53,100 --> 00:51:55,540
- Do you guys think this mustache makes me look

1238
00:51:55,540 --> 00:51:58,580
like a certain German figure from history?

1239
00:51:58,580 --> 00:52:00,700
- The mustache, yes, it is a full,

1240
00:52:00,700 --> 00:52:05,340
You're like, it's so scary that your body naturally

1241
00:52:05,340 --> 00:52:07,380
like wants to look like Hitler.

1242
00:52:07,380 --> 00:52:10,460
Like your hair grows like him.

1243
00:52:10,460 --> 00:52:11,620
- That's not true. - Your mustache.

1244
00:52:11,620 --> 00:52:13,820
You look exactly like Mexican Hitler.

1245
00:52:13,820 --> 00:52:15,440
- It's just because of the video.

1246
00:52:15,440 --> 00:52:17,140
I don't look like this in real life.

1247
00:52:17,140 --> 00:52:17,980
I look like the one in real life.

1248
00:52:17,980 --> 00:52:20,020
- I mean, you look like that in every photo too.

1249
00:52:20,020 --> 00:52:22,620
Your mustache just naturally grows really thick.

1250
00:52:22,620 --> 00:52:23,620
- Take the glasses off.

1251
00:52:23,620 --> 00:52:25,620
Let's see. - Between these two parts.

1252
00:52:25,620 --> 00:52:28,360
- You know how Hitler has that face where he's like,

1253
00:52:28,360 --> 00:52:29,660
make that face.

1254
00:52:29,660 --> 00:52:30,820
What's that face?

1255
00:52:30,820 --> 00:52:32,620
- Just like do this, like, "Whoa!"

1256
00:52:32,620 --> 00:52:35,220
- Good Lord, dude.

1257
00:52:35,220 --> 00:52:36,460
- It looked exactly like--

1258
00:52:36,460 --> 00:52:38,700
- Born in Brazil or Mexico, come on now.

1259
00:52:38,700 --> 00:52:40,160
- That is crazy.

1260
00:52:40,160 --> 00:52:42,580
That'd make a lot of sense-- - It's not true.

1261
00:52:42,580 --> 00:52:47,020
- If you were a descendant of Adolf Hitler.

1262
00:52:47,020 --> 00:52:50,500
- Yeah, just like six foot tall Mexican guy.

1263
00:52:50,500 --> 00:52:51,320
- Yeah.

1264
00:52:51,320 --> 00:52:53,700
- Just towering over-- - Alabaster white skin.

1265
00:52:53,700 --> 00:52:55,340
- Yeah.

1266
00:52:55,340 --> 00:52:57,300
- Hitler mustache. - Hateful, hateful ideas.

1267
00:52:57,300 --> 00:53:02,300
I'm completely, 100 out of 100, autentico Mexican.

1268
00:53:02,300 --> 00:53:05,220
- You are not.

1269
00:53:05,220 --> 00:53:07,100
You are mostly Spanish.

1270
00:53:07,100 --> 00:53:09,060
- I don't think I'm mostly Spanish,

1271
00:53:09,060 --> 00:53:12,060
but I feel like I do have some Spanish shit.

1272
00:53:12,060 --> 00:53:14,220
- You are fully conquistador.

1273
00:53:14,220 --> 00:53:15,060
- No.

1274
00:53:15,060 --> 00:53:16,380
- Yeah, you are.

1275
00:53:16,380 --> 00:53:17,220
Right?

1276
00:53:17,220 --> 00:53:18,040
- No.

1277
00:53:18,040 --> 00:53:20,060
- You mentioned like Louis C.K. is Mexican.

1278
00:53:20,060 --> 00:53:21,540
- Yeah.

1279
00:53:21,540 --> 00:53:24,700
- I think if we met, I think we would really hit it off.

1280
00:53:24,700 --> 00:53:26,280
I think we would be friends.

1281
00:53:26,280 --> 00:53:27,880
You and Louis CK?

1282
00:53:27,880 --> 00:53:28,880
Yeah.

1283
00:53:28,880 --> 00:53:29,880
Do you speak Spanish at all?

1284
00:53:29,880 --> 00:53:34,200
What in particular do you have in common with him?

1285
00:53:34,200 --> 00:53:35,200
Don't say it.

1286
00:53:35,200 --> 00:53:36,200
Mexican.

1287
00:53:36,200 --> 00:53:38,560
That is true.

1288
00:53:38,560 --> 00:53:40,840
Both born in Mexico.

1289
00:53:40,840 --> 00:53:47,480
Both Mexicans who speak English, the first of their kind, according to some people.

1290
00:53:47,480 --> 00:53:48,480
Yep.

1291
00:53:48,480 --> 00:53:49,960
Are they rich, too?

1292
00:53:49,960 --> 00:53:50,960
Both of you are Chino?

1293
00:53:50,960 --> 00:53:51,960
I'm not Chino.

1294
00:53:51,960 --> 00:53:52,960
You're Chino.

1295
00:53:52,960 --> 00:54:02,520
Oh you're Chino. Am I? You are, you're Chino. Did I talk about how I got assaulted by a

1296
00:54:02,520 --> 00:54:09,160
white liberal woman in New York? No. Oh the lady whose house we were at that

1297
00:54:09,160 --> 00:54:17,040
day? Yeah, so I guess I did, I was participate to like a woke

1298
00:54:17,040 --> 00:54:19,820
a book as an attack on my person.

1299
00:54:19,820 --> 00:54:22,700
This white lady who claimed to be a hippie

1300
00:54:22,700 --> 00:54:25,380
just kept asking me how I knew how to speak English

1301
00:54:25,380 --> 00:54:27,140
and where I was from.

1302
00:54:27,140 --> 00:54:29,820
And I was like, "Oh, I'm from the northern part of Mexico."

1303
00:54:29,820 --> 00:54:32,180
And she's like, "Oh, well just this morning

1304
00:54:32,180 --> 00:54:34,440
"there was a shooting there and 10 people died.

1305
00:54:34,440 --> 00:54:35,280
"You must have heard about that."

1306
00:54:35,280 --> 00:54:38,580
I was like, "No, not at all, I don't know."

1307
00:54:38,580 --> 00:54:39,860
She's like, "Check your,"

1308
00:54:39,860 --> 00:54:41,780
I opened, so after she says that,

1309
00:54:41,780 --> 00:54:43,260
I open up my phone-- - Don't tell me she said

1310
00:54:43,260 --> 00:54:44,740
check your WhatsApp.

1311
00:54:44,740 --> 00:54:47,420
No, I opened my Twitter and she's like,

1312
00:54:47,420 --> 00:54:48,780
yeah, just check your feed.

1313
00:54:48,780 --> 00:54:50,780
You'll surely find it there.

1314
00:54:50,780 --> 00:54:53,320
I was like, okay, thank you, ma'am.

1315
00:54:53,320 --> 00:54:54,900
And then she left me alone.

1316
00:54:54,900 --> 00:54:55,740
But I wasn't really a victim.

1317
00:54:55,740 --> 00:54:57,660
- She doesn't realize that you only follow

1318
00:54:57,660 --> 00:54:59,740
basically all the members of FaZe

1319
00:54:59,740 --> 00:55:03,540
and no Mexican media outlets, nothing like that at all.

1320
00:55:03,540 --> 00:55:08,540
- And Grace Van, what's her name?

1321
00:55:08,540 --> 00:55:10,480
What's her name?

1322
00:55:10,480 --> 00:55:11,860
The Grace Bitch?

1323
00:55:11,860 --> 00:55:13,060
- Van Buren?

1324
00:55:13,060 --> 00:55:14,380
- Yeah, something like that.

1325
00:55:14,380 --> 00:55:16,120
- Who's ruining Faye's clan?

1326
00:55:16,120 --> 00:55:18,340
- Oh, I-- - Ruining, dude.

1327
00:55:18,340 --> 00:55:19,580
- See, okay. - Come on.

1328
00:55:19,580 --> 00:55:22,140
- I have been worried. - That hoe.

1329
00:55:22,140 --> 00:55:26,860
- I've been worried about learning about this story

1330
00:55:26,860 --> 00:55:31,860
because I just didn't feel right talking about it

1331
00:55:31,860 --> 00:55:34,860
without you two around,

1332
00:55:34,860 --> 00:55:36,660
and thinking about it without you two around.

1333
00:55:36,660 --> 00:55:39,620
So next week, once everyone's forgotten about that,

1334
00:55:39,620 --> 00:55:40,820
I'd like all of us to come in

1335
00:55:40,820 --> 00:55:42,420
with a take on this whole thing.

1336
00:55:43,380 --> 00:55:46,500
I think she quit Faze, so that's a perfect time to talk about it.

1337
00:55:46,500 --> 00:55:49,300
What is the whole, I mean, I don't even know what the,

1338
00:55:49,300 --> 00:55:53,060
do you know what the name is? I don't know. It seemed very boring.

1339
00:55:53,060 --> 00:55:54,980
She doesn't know about modern warfare too.

1340
00:55:54,980 --> 00:55:58,980
She doesn't know about trick shots. She doesn't know about 360 no scopes.

1341
00:55:58,980 --> 00:56:03,420
She's mid AF. She's a whore.

1342
00:56:03,420 --> 00:56:06,300
I don't know. I'm kidding.

1343
00:56:06,300 --> 00:56:11,020
I think I saw a video about this and they talked about how

1344
00:56:12,380 --> 00:56:14,380
She's ruining FaZe Clan by being a woman.

1345
00:56:14,380 --> 00:56:14,880
No.

1346
00:56:14,880 --> 00:56:19,880
Listen, there's so much more wrong with FaZe other than inviting a woman to unfaZe.

1347
00:56:19,880 --> 00:56:21,380
In my opinion.

1348
00:56:21,380 --> 00:56:24,380
Like, giving all that money to Snoop Dogg and his son.

1349
00:56:24,380 --> 00:56:28,380
All that shit with going public. I mean, come on guys.

1350
00:56:28,380 --> 00:56:30,880
Also, I don't have any-

1351
00:56:30,880 --> 00:56:36,880
I hate when gaming goes corporate and they start hiring women via diversity and inclusion and equity.

1352
00:56:38,380 --> 00:56:46,380
Okay, so Faze signed her and then this guy who's in Faze got mad about it.

1353
00:56:46,380 --> 00:56:48,880
But then she just left.

1354
00:56:48,880 --> 00:56:50,880
Well, the OGs got mad about it.

1355
00:56:50,880 --> 00:56:52,880
That's pretty funny. The OGs.

1356
00:56:52,880 --> 00:56:56,880
So she, he was like, she doesn't know about Modern Warfare.

1357
00:56:56,880 --> 00:56:58,880
She's never seen a trickshot montage.

1358
00:56:58,880 --> 00:57:00,880
She's golden Valorant.

1359
00:57:00,880 --> 00:57:02,880
Whoa!

1360
00:57:02,880 --> 00:57:04,880
That's not forgivable.

1361
00:57:04,880 --> 00:57:09,560
She was like, you almost overdosed on, on stream two years ago.

1362
00:57:09,560 --> 00:57:10,280
Whoa.

1363
00:57:10,280 --> 00:57:14,400
Here's like, Oh, you're actually bid your mid.

1364
00:57:14,400 --> 00:57:15,640
Oh my God.

1365
00:57:15,640 --> 00:57:17,120
I love this kind of drama.

1366
00:57:17,120 --> 00:57:19,920
They had a conversation they had.

1367
00:57:19,920 --> 00:57:24,080
And then, well, after that, they had a sit down to hash it out.

1368
00:57:24,080 --> 00:57:24,920
Yeah.

1369
00:57:24,920 --> 00:57:28,840
And then I didn't learn anything about that conversation, except that she said

1370
00:57:28,840 --> 00:57:33,400
if they posted it, she would leave face clan and they posted it and then she left.

1371
00:57:33,440 --> 00:57:34,440
Damn.

1372
00:57:34,440 --> 00:57:36,640
We should turn into like a Keemstar

1373
00:57:36,640 --> 00:57:38,720
style drama thing.

1374
00:57:38,720 --> 00:57:39,400
Yeah.

1375
00:57:39,400 --> 00:57:40,960
This show should be pure

1376
00:57:40,960 --> 00:57:42,520
TMZ or...

1377
00:57:42,520 --> 00:57:44,680
But in the way that we just did it

1378
00:57:44,680 --> 00:57:46,200
just now, where only one of us kind of

1379
00:57:46,200 --> 00:57:47,200
knows what happened.

1380
00:57:47,200 --> 00:57:48,840
You were like, that's crazy.

1381
00:57:48,840 --> 00:57:49,840
I think I kind of heard about that.

1382
00:57:49,840 --> 00:57:53,280
You're getting all the details wrong.

1383
00:57:53,280 --> 00:57:55,480
Yeah.

1384
00:57:55,480 --> 00:57:58,120
Well, tooth dies in darkness.

1385
00:57:58,120 --> 00:57:59,360
You know that.

1386
00:57:59,360 --> 00:58:01,360
Tooth dies in darkness?

1387
00:58:01,360 --> 00:58:02,600
Truth dies in darkness.

1388
00:58:02,840 --> 00:58:05,280
Democracy dies in the darkness, as The Washington Post thing.

1389
00:58:05,280 --> 00:58:07,320
And my lights are bad.

1390
00:58:07,320 --> 00:58:09,960
I feel like everyone explains stuff so poorly now.

1391
00:58:09,960 --> 00:58:13,400
Do you think that was that's always been how people explain stuff?

1392
00:58:13,400 --> 00:58:16,600
It's like, I think I heard like, yes, like

1393
00:58:16,600 --> 00:58:18,960
about like Pearl Harbor or something.

1394
00:58:18,960 --> 00:58:21,320
Do you think it was like, dude, I think I heard about that?

1395
00:58:21,320 --> 00:58:22,000
What was that again?

1396
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:24,760
He's like, yeah, it's some fucking Chinese guys.

1397
00:58:24,760 --> 00:58:30,200
Ten or or like 100 like Chinese guys with like a bunch of they were.

1398
00:58:30,280 --> 00:58:33,840
I think they were, they had parachutes or paragliders.

1399
00:58:33,840 --> 00:58:36,360
- You know what's the prime example of this?

1400
00:58:36,360 --> 00:58:37,280
- What?

1401
00:58:37,280 --> 00:58:38,600
- Jesus Christ, the Bible.

1402
00:58:38,600 --> 00:58:40,400
- That's true.

1403
00:58:40,400 --> 00:58:44,280
- I can't believe you have the balls to say that to me.

1404
00:58:44,280 --> 00:58:46,660
- God's only forgotten, son.

1405
00:58:46,660 --> 00:58:48,560
- Begotten.

1406
00:58:48,560 --> 00:58:50,860
He was not foregotten, he was begotten.

1407
00:58:50,860 --> 00:58:53,280
(laughing)

1408
00:58:53,280 --> 00:58:56,300
It's actually the line in the Bible.

1409
00:58:56,300 --> 00:58:58,160
- Where'd he go?

1410
00:58:59,440 --> 00:59:01,040
- Oh, it's in Israel.

1411
00:59:01,040 --> 00:59:03,140
- Oh shit, yeah, God's sitting there.

1412
00:59:03,140 --> 00:59:05,080
- Oh shit, I left that guy.

1413
00:59:05,080 --> 00:59:06,640
- Oh fuck, I have a son.

1414
00:59:06,640 --> 00:59:07,780
I think I left him.

1415
00:59:07,780 --> 00:59:09,440
Wait, what's he's doing?

1416
00:59:09,440 --> 00:59:13,100
- God did the equivalent of leaving a baby in a hot car.

1417
00:59:13,100 --> 00:59:13,940
- Yeah, exactly.

1418
00:59:13,940 --> 00:59:16,280
(laughing)

1419
00:59:16,280 --> 00:59:18,160
Yeah, oh fuck.

1420
00:59:18,160 --> 00:59:20,240
Yeah, 'cause for him it was only like three hours.

1421
00:59:20,240 --> 00:59:22,240
It was 33 years on Earth, but.

1422
00:59:22,240 --> 00:59:23,360
- Yeah.

1423
00:59:23,360 --> 00:59:24,320
- Yeah, do you think he cared?

1424
00:59:24,320 --> 00:59:26,480
- He just popped in for two beers at the bar

1425
00:59:26,480 --> 00:59:27,320
and left Jesus in the car.

1426
00:59:27,320 --> 00:59:28,400
- Do you think he cared at all?

1427
00:59:28,400 --> 00:59:29,240
I'll be right back.

1428
00:59:29,240 --> 00:59:33,040
No, just chill. It's chill. Hey, can you watch him?

1429
00:59:33,040 --> 00:59:37,840
Can you watch him? Make sure he doesn't get crucified.

1430
00:59:37,840 --> 00:59:41,160
See what, yeah. What if you left your baby with your,

1431
00:59:41,160 --> 00:59:43,360
with your dog for one minute and you came back,

1432
00:59:43,360 --> 00:59:44,480
the dog was crucifying your baby.

1433
00:59:44,480 --> 00:59:48,320
I would think that was Jesus Christ.

1434
00:59:48,320 --> 00:59:51,800
I would honestly think the baby was, or the dog was Jesus Christ.

1435
00:59:51,800 --> 00:59:56,080
My child was the antichrist.

1436
00:59:56,080 --> 00:59:57,720
What do you guys think of that movie Mother?

1437
00:59:57,720 --> 00:59:59,720
I've never watched it.

1438
00:59:59,720 --> 01:00:01,720
I don't even know, is that a movie?

1439
01:00:01,720 --> 01:00:03,720
Yeah, Darren Aronofsky?

1440
01:00:03,720 --> 01:00:05,720
Nah, I don't care about...

1441
01:00:05,720 --> 01:00:07,720
Is that motherfucker who did Black Swan?

1442
01:00:07,720 --> 01:00:09,720
I'm curious, I just was thinking about...

1443
01:00:09,720 --> 01:00:11,720
You're stupid. You know what I was watching on the plane?

1444
01:00:11,720 --> 01:00:13,720
I was watching the Super Mario Bros. movie

1445
01:00:13,720 --> 01:00:15,720
and I didn't finish it.

1446
01:00:15,720 --> 01:00:17,720
The old one?

1447
01:00:17,720 --> 01:00:19,720
The new one.

1448
01:00:19,720 --> 01:00:21,720
Oh, nah.

1449
01:00:21,720 --> 01:00:23,720
I watched the first 10 minutes of The Whale, which I didn't realize he's gay in it

1450
01:00:23,720 --> 01:00:25,720
and I turned it off.

1451
01:00:25,720 --> 01:00:27,960
(laughing)

1452
01:00:27,960 --> 01:00:40,000
I know those aren't,

1453
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:43,920
I know those aren't related, but

1454
01:00:43,920 --> 01:00:49,040
just your tone of voice

1455
01:00:49,040 --> 01:00:52,480
in these two separate anecdotes,

1456
01:00:52,480 --> 01:00:54,780
man, it sounds so intentional.

1457
01:00:54,780 --> 01:00:57,040
(laughing)

1458
01:00:57,040 --> 01:00:59,980
- Okay, so for next week,

1459
01:00:59,980 --> 01:01:02,460
I'm gonna finish the Super Mario Bros. movie.

1460
01:01:02,460 --> 01:01:03,660
Rex is gonna finish the whale,

1461
01:01:03,660 --> 01:01:06,900
and Caleb's gonna learn about the fish situation.

1462
01:01:06,900 --> 01:01:07,740
- It's actually not that even,

1463
01:01:07,740 --> 01:01:09,900
not even that good a movie, honestly.

1464
01:01:09,900 --> 01:01:11,260
- What, the whale?

1465
01:01:11,260 --> 01:01:12,100
- Yeah.

1466
01:01:12,100 --> 01:01:12,940
Do you watch it?

1467
01:01:12,940 --> 01:01:17,940
- No, I don't like when people are fat.

1468
01:01:17,940 --> 01:01:23,100
No, I just don't, I don't like the--

1469
01:01:23,100 --> 01:01:24,700
- It is uncomfortable to watch.

1470
01:01:24,700 --> 01:01:29,420
- I truly don't care for powerhouse performances

1471
01:01:29,420 --> 01:01:31,220
in bad movies.

1472
01:01:31,220 --> 01:01:32,060
You know what I mean?

1473
01:01:32,060 --> 01:01:34,140
- He is completely fat to an uncomfortable degree.

1474
01:01:34,140 --> 01:01:38,180
- I don't like movies that are like six out of 10 movies

1475
01:01:38,180 --> 01:01:40,860
that have an amazing star turning performance.

1476
01:01:40,860 --> 01:01:43,940
That's like, to me, even if I might like the movie

1477
01:01:43,940 --> 01:01:46,900
when I watch it, it's like not a motivating,

1478
01:01:46,900 --> 01:01:47,740
it's not gonna make me watch it.

1479
01:01:47,740 --> 01:01:50,220
- I didn't like that he was like having a heart attack

1480
01:01:50,220 --> 01:01:53,940
from jacking off because that also happens to me.

1481
01:01:55,940 --> 01:01:57,060
That's what happened to the movie.

1482
01:01:57,060 --> 01:01:57,900
That's the start of the movie.

1483
01:01:57,900 --> 01:02:01,340
He's jacking off to gay porn on his laptop.

1484
01:02:01,340 --> 01:02:04,340
- Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

1485
01:02:04,340 --> 01:02:06,020
Yeah, hang on.

1486
01:02:06,020 --> 01:02:09,300
You saw this, this is the first minute of the movie,

1487
01:02:09,300 --> 01:02:11,540
and you waited 10 minutes after that to be like,

1488
01:02:11,540 --> 01:02:13,580
wait, he's gay, and you turn it off.

1489
01:02:13,580 --> 01:02:14,420
(laughing)

1490
01:02:14,420 --> 01:02:16,860
- Wait, also, two more things.

1491
01:02:16,860 --> 01:02:19,740
Number one, you said it happens to you

1492
01:02:19,740 --> 01:02:22,300
that you get a heart attack when you jack off.

1493
01:02:22,300 --> 01:02:23,460
- To gay porn.

1494
01:02:23,460 --> 01:02:25,680
- Yeah, and then the other thing is to gay porn.

1495
01:02:25,680 --> 01:02:29,640
But also, you said it happens, you turned it off

1496
01:02:29,640 --> 01:02:31,680
because something in the movie happens to you

1497
01:02:31,680 --> 01:02:34,040
and it's about a guy who's 600 pounds.

1498
01:02:34,040 --> 01:02:35,640
- Yeah, I know.

1499
01:02:35,640 --> 01:02:37,840
It's embarrassing, I didn't wanna see that.

1500
01:02:37,840 --> 01:02:40,080
(laughing)

1501
01:02:40,080 --> 01:02:43,400
- 'Cause they're thinking, they don't even,

1502
01:02:43,400 --> 01:02:44,220
they're just thinking like,

1503
01:02:44,220 --> 01:02:45,680
what would happen to a 600 pound guy?

1504
01:02:45,680 --> 01:02:47,240
Oh, he probably gets a heart palpitation

1505
01:02:47,240 --> 01:02:48,720
when he masturbates.

1506
01:02:48,720 --> 01:02:49,560
- Well, listen. - That's the only

1507
01:02:49,560 --> 01:02:50,880
kind of person. - If you guys,

1508
01:02:50,880 --> 01:02:53,480
if you guys don't care to watch the whole movie,

1509
01:02:53,480 --> 01:02:55,320
the ending, he gets completely skinny

1510
01:02:55,320 --> 01:02:57,980
and he lives his life happily ever after.

1511
01:02:57,980 --> 01:02:58,820
And he gets back with his wife.

1512
01:02:58,820 --> 01:03:00,140
- Oh yeah.

1513
01:03:00,140 --> 01:03:00,980
- Why?

1514
01:03:00,980 --> 01:03:01,820
- With his wife.

1515
01:03:01,820 --> 01:03:04,520
He's gay.

1516
01:03:04,520 --> 01:03:05,360
- He's gay.

1517
01:03:05,360 --> 01:03:08,820
We gotta go.

1518
01:03:08,820 --> 01:03:10,740
We gotta go. - All right, bye.
