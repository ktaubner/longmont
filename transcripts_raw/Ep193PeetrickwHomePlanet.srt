00:01:58,100 --> 00:01:59,540
I get like full rim sleep.

63
00:01:59,540 --> 00:02:02,860
When you accept that you don't want to watch whatever movie you're watching and you just

64
00:02:02,860 --> 00:02:03,860
want to sleep.

65
00:02:03,860 --> 00:02:04,860

69
00:02:09,460 --> 00:02:12,860
And then there was a big explosion woke me up, brought me right back into it.

That was really good.

73
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:23,860
Do it again.

74
00:02:23,860 --> 00:02:28,660
you please say something awesome and then crunch a chip awesome like I woke up

75
00:02:28,660 --> 00:02:35,260
this morning and I I took a shower. Oh, my really sells it. You know, I can't

76
00:02:35,260 --> 00:02:38,660
imagine that's what you eat a chip in the shower or no, not be eating them

77
00:02:38,660 --> 00:02:42,380
chips. Now, I know I know making up for lost time. I cleaned our shower this

78
00:02:42,380 --> 00:02:46,020
morning. Yeah, I don't know last night. I cleaned it. Okay, now I clean my

79
00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:50,260
spring early shower. That's right. I use you guys use your body to clean your

80
00:02:50,260 --> 00:02:53,620
shower. I use my shower to clean my body. Yeah, sometimes I have my body to

81
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:58,960
clean my body in my shower to clean my shower. Do you guys use a loofah a rag or

82
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:03,980
your hand? I'm a hand man. Whoa, I'm a hand man never in my life. Have I used a

83
00:03:03,980 --> 00:03:08,600
loofah? No, yeah, I'm not a loofah. I would I say most usually hand. I'll

84
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:10,980
sometimes a washcloth. I'm a washcloth. Use

85
00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:13,520
your hands, though, because it's

86
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:19,800
get dirty. Yeah, you clean it. You don't like use it over and I don't really

87
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:23,620
want to be shoving a washcloth on my butthole. That's like how you get your

88
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:27,820
clean though. No, because you if you stick you can this is this guy this guy knows. I

89
00:03:27,820 --> 00:03:31,980
didn't realize it until it's caught somewhat recently but you can put soap in

90
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:36,800
your butthole. Oh yeah. You stick a finger in your butt. But it's about the

91
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:41,980
abrasion because a piece of soap if soap touches shit it doesn't just make it

92
00:03:41,980 --> 00:03:46,420
disappear. It eliminates it. It just covers it with soap. Well you're still. You have to

93
00:03:46,420 --> 00:03:49,940
you have to use. I'm not going to go all the way. No, if you touch soap on something

94
00:03:49,940 --> 00:03:54,860
dirty it go it you do put the water on your ass in your hole a little bit but

95
00:03:54,860 --> 00:03:57,900
then it doesn't gross you out when you use it on your face are you like this

96
00:03:57,900 --> 00:04:02,420
was in my book I use my washcloth on my face we talk like when you shave when I

97
00:04:02,420 --> 00:04:05,820
shit and I have a different rag for that different different I use a two rag

98
00:04:05,820 --> 00:04:11,980
system any washcloth do you have 15 16 one for every part of color coordinated

99
00:04:11,980 --> 00:04:18,180
brown for my butt white for my face I do you're confused all the time like wait a

100
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:21,020
Wait, but I have a white face and a white ass

101
00:04:21,020 --> 00:04:30,460
Or did I do it opposites on purpose is that my sister I like that you just had your butt is like a black man's

102
00:04:30,460 --> 00:04:37,780
But I have a pitch black, but you got a nice booty. I have a shining African, but the rest of my body is pink

103
00:04:37,780 --> 00:04:41,740
It did take until I think I was like 19 or 20

104
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:45,280
When I first realized like it wasn't like methodical

105
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:50,920
But I realized that I would like most times that I took a shower. I washed my butt and then I washed my hair afterwards

106
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:55,460
Yeah hair is better than fit. Well, I guess it drips. Well, it's just I was just like I'm probably putting

107
00:04:55,460 --> 00:05:03,540
But like you're not that's so far removed nobody's gonna be like smelling your hair later and be like there's poop in your hair

108
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:08,520
I'm sorry. It's not it's not. Yeah, it's not it's not like that. You are physically going to have poop in here

109
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:11,240
It's just it's just a gross thing. Yeah, it's the gross

110
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:15,540
It's the same grossness of like if you like just clean the floor and then you like drop

111
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:20,440
Like something that you were eating onto the floor where it's like technically it's not brings it to a no

112
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:25,700
It's just yeah, it's just like it's like a it's like a it's like a Victorian miasma thing

113
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:28,860
It's like this has this like it's like just logical. It's like

114
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:35,920
If you walk into the bathroom and it smells like poop you're gonna feel disgusted. You're covered in poo

115
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:40,880
I do feel like the poop like what what am I smelling? I'm definitely getting poop particles in them

116
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:43,640
Yeah, well, okay, so yeah, so poop can stay in the air for hours

117
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:47,280
But it can't go in your hair on your hand in 10 seconds. No. No, I'm agreeing with you

118
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:51,560
I'm starting to understand your point. It's also, it's pooping after you take a shower feels similar. Oh, oh, I hate that

119
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:57,560
Yeah, when you had a wet butthole. Yeah, it's like I just cleaned every single part of it. And then there's like no, you can't wipe it

120
00:05:57,560 --> 00:06:04,240
So you just gotta leave it in there. Hold on. Sorry. I have to record something at like 3. You just remembered? Yeah

121
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:09,040
What time is it? It's like 2 45. I don't we're not gonna get like the whole episode done

122
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:11,200
We can do an hour episode in 13 minutes.

123
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:16,000
I'm gonna pause.

124
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:22,240
What's so funny about the timer?

125
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:26,320
How else will you know what time how long we've been recording?

126
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:30,160
Math is funny to me because I'm such a literature guy.

127
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:31,040
Is it because you're such a cretin?

128
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:31,520
Nope.

129
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:32,640
Yeah, because you're such a dope.

130
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:38,960
He's doing the thing too, the fucking thing that I do every time.

131
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:43,920
you know there's a noise upstairs. Yeah, I mean I'll you got to you got to look

132
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:49,320
up, but you don't have to go wait. What was that? Do you freak out with the

133
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:52,320
noise? He always is like like we'll be talking about something and recording

134
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:54,400
and he'll he'll hear a noise upstairs and he'll go.

135
00:06:54,400 --> 00:07:00,160
I feel like it's the same thing when like when you're on the when you're on

136
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:02,920
the train and like someone's acting crazy and the person across he was like

137
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:05,120
Yeah, I don't care. Yeah

138
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:07,480
I

139
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:08,440
Love doing that

140
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:13,860
Have you guys seen the the videos were like somebody gets in a fight on the train or something and it's Mike Tyson got in

141
00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:16,200
The fight on the plane like yesterday what?

142
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:20,800
Oh, I saw that just now there was a guy who was like a drunk guy was annoying Mike Tyson on a plane

143
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:25,720
I think yesterday and then I don't it's a video of I saw a picture of it

144
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:29,160
Just like being really annoying and it's a bloody Tim in the headline

145
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:31,920
There's a video from behind that guy, just Mike Tyson going like

146
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:32,920
Whoa!

147
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:33,920

148
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:34,920
Yeah, and he's like bloody after that.

149
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:35,920
He says he, like Mike Tyson is like

150
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:36,920
That's so cool.

151
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:37,920
It looks like he's in like Coach.

152
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:38,920
No, it's First Class for sure.

153
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:39,920
Bro Boy?

154
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:40,920
It's like a booth thing.

155
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:41,920
It's like, it seems like that.

156
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:42,920
Oh, okay.

157
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:43,920
I think this was a restaurant.

158
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:44,920
Maybe I saw a different video.

159
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:45,920
I think this was Applebee's.

160
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:46,920
Mike Tyson is like a very interesting guy to me.

161
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:47,920
Cause he's like actually a fucking lunatic.

162
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:48,920
Yeah.

163
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:49,920
And he like talks all the time about like, there was a guy that he was, he was like, he

164
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:50,920
was like a lunatic.

165
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:51,920
Yeah.

166
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:56,060
me because he's like actually a fucking lunatic yeah and he like talks about all

167
00:07:56,060 --> 00:08:01,080
the time but like there was a guy that he was he like the guy taught him how to

168
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:05,520
box and basically told him like you are going to become a super weapon with no

169
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:11,160
conscience and he was like 15 he's like okay and he just did that and then he had like kids

170
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:15,960
and shit and he was like oh wait I need to like I can't just punch stuff all the

171
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:19,240
time right and then he became and now he's trying to get back into boxing again

172
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:25,760
yeah you know what the plane he's only 23 years old he could be 60 to be 70 years

173
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:31,560
old I don't know 65 that's great he's really crazy yeah I think being a living

174
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:37,120
weapon is one of the coolest things ever yeah like really I'm talking gun yeah

175
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:41,840
living weapon and also having like a 10-year stint on Adult Swim is like yeah

176
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:45,600
yeah and he was like good friends with like Norm MacDonald I need someone in

177
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:49,520
the face it says here yet he appeared at San Francisco's 420 Cannabis Festival

178
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:56,080
whoa so he smokes weed - I really need a celebrity who has swords for arms like

179
00:08:56,080 --> 00:09:02,880
like grafted on blades like Baraka yeah like Baraka but no hands just just

180
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:07,880
yeah just this happened after the 420 festival

181
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:16,580
herb yeah this is gonna come out like yeah so he'll probably do it again okay

182
00:09:16,580 --> 00:09:27,340
he did this at the 520 fest here's a here's a headline from November 2021 okay

183
00:09:27,340 --> 00:09:33,260
so I'm going even farther Mike Tyson used sex to keep me keep himself from

184
00:09:33,260 --> 00:09:38,260
committing murder Mike Tyson said earlier this week that he died from

185
00:09:38,260 --> 00:09:46,060
psychedelic dude he's awesome he went on podcast and he ate like like like a

186
00:09:46,060 --> 00:09:49,540
heroic dose of mushrooms at the beginning of it you're big you're big

187
00:09:49,540 --> 00:09:56,180
Jake Paul no big Mike Tyson clip on podcast guy I've seen I need a guy who

188
00:09:56,180 --> 00:10:03,500
acts like this but he has like a cannon and yeah there's a there's a clip where

189
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:08,980
Joe Rogan talks about how the reason he made his table bigger on his podcast like

190
00:10:08,980 --> 00:10:12,260
the bigger space between him and the other guests because he had Mike Tyson

191
00:10:12,260 --> 00:10:17,260
on he was really scared of them and he was like I have to get a new table so

192
00:10:17,260 --> 00:10:22,500
cool dude yeah I would get a smaller table if it was Mike Tyson yeah I get it

193
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:25,220
I get one of the tables I put in the middle of the pizza yeah it would be

194
00:10:25,220 --> 00:10:29,300
like a prank those are for say I tell you box you hold it down and then you

195
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:36,020
slide the pizza out. No it's not. What? Slide what pizza out? You hold it down onto one

196
00:10:36,020 --> 00:10:40,740
end of the slice, you like flip it like that and then pull it up. That may be true but

197
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:46,980
that's one of the things that you'll see like somebody posted a TikTok video of it.

198
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:50,660
Like this is actually what it's for. It's like I don't believe you. You made that up.

199
00:10:50,660 --> 00:10:52,900
I don't care if that's what it's for or not. I was under the impression it was a stacking,

200
00:10:52,900 --> 00:10:58,100
when you stack like 10 pizzas on top of each other so it doesn't cave in. Yeah. That makes

201
00:10:58,100 --> 00:11:01,300
takes more. It could be multi-purpose. Do you guys know what bottle caps are secretly for?

202
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:06,180
What? Keeping in drink. Look at this. Okay. So they're for falling out. Okay. They're

203
00:11:06,180 --> 00:11:11,220
for disguising yourself as a different person. Yeah. Did you just turn off your mic? Did

204
00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:16,980
I? Oh yeah. I think I did. Just turn the switch on. Is it on now? No. No. You just turned

205
00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:20,780
it off. This episode's going amazing. This is the best episode ever. This is the best

206
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:25,060
episode we've ever done. Wait, what's going on? Can you hear me? No, what the fuck? Alright,

207
00:11:25,060 --> 00:11:27,060
alright let's just abandon ship

208
00:11:27,060 --> 00:11:31,780
lost episode. Hello, hello

209
00:11:31,780 --> 00:11:34,520
can you hear this? Yeah I can hear you eating now

210
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:36,820
it only works when he eats. I guess

211
00:11:36,820 --> 00:11:40,820
just don't mess with the switch, just leave the switch on. Can you hold that for me?

212
00:11:40,820 --> 00:11:45,640
I am not holding that for you. Do you guys ever, we were talking about showers, do you guys ever take baths?

213
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:51,540
no. We just got a place that, well actually you guys had a tub the whole time

214
00:11:51,540 --> 00:11:53,280
disgusting. I'm too big for a tub

215
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:57,780
I'm too big for bats in general. I need like a king-size tub if I want to fit.

216
00:11:57,780 --> 00:11:58,280
Me too.

217
00:11:58,280 --> 00:11:58,780
A jacuzzi tub.

218
00:11:58,780 --> 00:12:00,780
It's not fun. It's not- it's also not like-

219
00:12:00,780 --> 00:12:03,780
I need like a- like a- like a...

220
00:12:03,780 --> 00:12:08,780
9 foot deep, uh, 11 foot long tub.

221
00:12:08,780 --> 00:12:09,780
That's a pool.

222
00:12:09,780 --> 00:12:12,780
That's a damn pool, you idiot!

223
00:12:12,780 --> 00:12:13,780
You what?

224
00:12:13,780 --> 00:12:15,780
11 feet long seems too long.

225
00:12:15,780 --> 00:12:16,780
No.

226
00:12:16,780 --> 00:12:17,780
And all it does to-

227
00:12:17,780 --> 00:12:18,280
How wide?

228
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:18,780
-if anything.

229
00:12:18,780 --> 00:12:21,780
Uh, 11. 11 by 11.

230
00:12:21,780 --> 00:12:23,780
I want an 8.5" x 11" tub.

231
00:12:23,780 --> 00:12:25,780
That's not going to fit.

232
00:12:25,780 --> 00:12:27,780
That's going to fit my papers though.

233
00:12:27,780 --> 00:12:29,780
Perfectly.

234
00:12:29,780 --> 00:12:31,780
We need to get them wet.

235
00:12:31,780 --> 00:12:33,780
You need an even soak on all pages.

236
00:12:33,780 --> 00:12:35,780
When you're doing a temporary tattoo,

237
00:12:35,780 --> 00:12:37,780
you gotta get it wet.

238
00:12:37,780 --> 00:12:39,780
It has to be perfect. Or like a rice paper, make a spring roll.

239
00:12:39,780 --> 00:12:41,780
Do you have a bubble bath in there?

240
00:12:41,780 --> 00:12:43,780
I haven't done a bubble bath in a minute.

241
00:12:43,780 --> 00:12:45,780
I take baths pretty often, but I might have to add bubble baths.

242
00:12:45,780 --> 00:12:47,780
You should be able to put the bubble bath stuff

243
00:12:47,780 --> 00:12:49,780
into the shower head

244
00:12:49,780 --> 00:12:56,380
Into the shower head and it puts bubbles out and you can take a bubble shower. Oh, I like sitting in my nasty

245
00:12:56,380 --> 00:13:04,620
Like you're okay, well clearly who I'm not gonna just put stuff it would be a product that someone designed to do

246
00:13:04,620 --> 00:13:09,420
When I come up with an imaginary product, it's not like you're just like you don't just be like, well, it wouldn't work

247
00:13:09,420 --> 00:13:13,140
Oh, no, they're in my brain. They're developing one that would work that way. Obviously

248
00:13:13,140 --> 00:13:17,400
I know if you put bubble bath stuff in your shower head, it's not gonna work. I wasn't looking I wasn't looking inside your brain

249
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:20,220
I'm sorry. That's no what you're doing is you're trying to pick me apart. You're trying to tear me down

250
00:13:20,220 --> 00:13:23,000
Just thinking I want to take a bubble shower. You're not thinking

251
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:26,360
That's what I'm saying

252
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:33,080
Bubble shower incorporated stuff. Yeah, mr. Wonderful. Yeah, mr. Bubble

253
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:45,640
I'm just pitching something completely impossible.

254
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:47,200
- Wait a minute, all I know is I wanna do this.

255
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:49,800
- Wait, wait, okay, so clear up some things for me.

256
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:50,680
How does this work?

257
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:54,200
I don't know, that's what I'm here for, idiot.

258
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:55,240
Mr. Wonderful.

259
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:57,040
- You're supposed to invent it for me, dumbass.

260
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:58,720
- How'd you get so damn fucking rich

261
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:00,840
if you weren't inventing anything, huh?

262
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:01,880
You idiot. - You're supposed to have one,

263
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:03,300
I read your book, you're supposed to have

264
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:05,280
one million inventions a day.

265
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:06,680
- Walking into Shark Tank and being like,

266
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:08,080
all right, before I start my pitch,

267
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:10,240
Mr. Wonderful, what do you want most in the world?

268
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:11,400
(laughing)

269
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:12,600
Okay, I'm inventing that.

270
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:13,440
(laughing)

271
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:15,940
- Okay, my product is new hair.

272
00:14:15,940 --> 00:14:19,480
- A boat that can't kill anybody.

273
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:21,140
(laughing)

274
00:14:21,140 --> 00:14:21,980
- A safety boat.

275
00:14:21,980 --> 00:14:24,380
- A boat that brings people back to life.

276
00:14:24,380 --> 00:14:26,980
(laughing)

277
00:14:26,980 --> 00:14:28,140
- Yeah, he's a man.

278
00:14:28,140 --> 00:14:28,980
- He's cool as fuck.

279
00:14:28,980 --> 00:14:31,200
- Oh man, remember we almost went to his seminar?

280
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:32,040
That would have been awesome.

281
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:33,040
- We were supposed to in Boston, he had a seminar.

282
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:34,460
- Yeah, we were gonna go to his,

283
00:14:34,460 --> 00:14:36,740
we were gonna put on suits and do a bunch of acid

284
00:14:36,740 --> 00:14:39,460
and go to this seminar in Malden.

285
00:14:39,460 --> 00:14:40,800
- And Caleb got sick, he had a stomach ache.

286
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:47,760
was like I'm I feel so sick. I don't want to go. Yeah, basically we could have

287
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:51,960
been millionaires. We almost went and then I was like they were like what do

288
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:56,040
we do like, but we don't have our boss Caleb with us. We probably can't go.

289
00:14:56,040 --> 00:15:00,280
It made us reconsider. Oh, I'm so nervous. You can't do something without Caleb.

290
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:04,480
We knew you were fucking ditching and we were like, we knew you reconsidered.

291
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:07,720
What kind of sick were you? I don't know. It was like fucking three years ago.

292
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:13,720
I remember this happening. It's a line he's lying bad food. Probably that

293
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:18,640
probably was a he ate bad food and he just went. Oh, I used to eat like such a

294
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:24,720
piece of shit in Boston. Awesome man. I ate I ate lamb and chicken over rice. I

295
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:28,400
eat peanut butter and jelly like three times a day. When I was healthy, that's

296
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:33,120
not healthy. That is not healthy. It's healthy. No, it's not like the worst

297
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:36,800
thing in the world, but it's not good for you. No PBJ is healthy. It's like

298
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:39,240
bread and sugar and no sugar.

299
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:40,080
- Tiny nuts.

300
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:40,900
- Oh really?

301
00:15:40,900 --> 00:15:41,740
- No sugar.

302
00:15:41,740 --> 00:15:42,580
- He said there's no sugar in it.

303
00:15:42,580 --> 00:15:43,760
- Peanut butter and jelly?

304
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:44,800
- There's no sugar.

305
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:46,240
- It's pure sugar.

306
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:47,080
- It's not pure sugar.

307
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:50,300
It's peanut butter and it's jelly.

308
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:54,460
You can put sugar on it if you want, but that's it.

309
00:15:54,460 --> 00:15:56,140
- What's happening?

310
00:15:56,140 --> 00:15:57,140
- You don't put sugar on it.

311
00:15:57,140 --> 00:15:58,720
- I'm gonna pause it now.

312
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:02,120
- And that's the first time I crapped myself.

313
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:03,820
- That was the first time?

314
00:16:03,820 --> 00:16:05,640
- That was the first time I crapped myself.

315
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:12,920
now when we pause it. I'm the special guest. I'm Casey Kasem. Casey Kasem? I'm Casey Kasem's

316
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:18,840
brother. Can you do Shaggy next? I'm also named Casey. It's Casey Kasem. Can you do J-Lo? It's

317
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:29,240
short for Ken Christmas Kasem. Who is Casey Krasem? He was the voice of Shaggy on the news.

318
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:31,960
I'm the new Scooby Doo.

319
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:33,960
(laughter)

320
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:35,960
I'm the new...

321
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:37,960
He was the voice of Shaggy in the voice of Radio.

322
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:39,960
I was so fucking heartbroken to see Shaggy on the news.

323
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:41,960
Yeah, I know.

324
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:43,960
Me too.

325
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:45,960
That's what he did.

326
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:47,960
That's the last thing I was expecting him to be.

327
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:49,960
Yeah, eaten by a monster.

328
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:51,960
(laughter)

329
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:53,960
He finally got eaten up by a monster.

330
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:55,960
Shaggy got eaten up by a monster.

331
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:57,960
He tried to pull his damn head off.

332
00:16:57,960 --> 00:17:00,060
Shaggy got eat up by monster.

333
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:01,060
Yah.

334
00:17:01,060 --> 00:17:02,060
What's going on?

335
00:17:02,060 --> 00:17:03,060
I don't know.

336
00:17:03,060 --> 00:17:04,060
I think I had too much sugar.

337
00:17:04,060 --> 00:17:05,060
You didn't have any sugar.

338
00:17:05,060 --> 00:17:06,060
Whoa, check this out.

339
00:17:06,060 --> 00:17:07,060
Yep, okay.

340
00:17:07,060 --> 00:17:08,060
Did they have a Twinkie the kid?

341
00:17:08,060 --> 00:17:09,060
You need to.

342
00:17:09,060 --> 00:17:10,060
Did they put a leash on Scooby Doo or no?

343
00:17:10,060 --> 00:17:11,060
No, never.

344
00:17:11,060 --> 00:17:12,060
He has a collar though.

345
00:17:12,060 --> 00:17:13,060
You can't match.

346
00:17:13,060 --> 00:17:14,060
I know he has a collar.

347
00:17:14,060 --> 00:17:15,060
They put a damn leash on Shaggy before they put one on Scooby.

348
00:17:15,060 --> 00:17:16,060
That's in case he gets lost though.

349
00:17:16,060 --> 00:17:17,060
But he's like a human.

350
00:17:17,060 --> 00:17:18,060
But he would probably just say, "I'm a human."

351
00:17:18,060 --> 00:17:19,060
I don't know.

352
00:17:19,060 --> 00:17:20,060
I don't know.

353
00:17:20,060 --> 00:17:21,060
I don't know.

354
00:17:21,060 --> 00:17:22,060
I don't know.

355
00:17:22,060 --> 00:17:23,060
I don't know.

356
00:17:23,060 --> 00:17:24,060
I don't know.

357
00:17:24,060 --> 00:17:29,180
gets lost though, but he's like a human, but he would probably say I'm with

358
00:17:29,180 --> 00:17:29,600
those

359
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:35,200
don't get it. Yeah, yeah, well, he probably rhyme with rose rice. Yeah,

360
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:39,660
rhyme with rose rice, french fries, right? Yeah, I'm with those guys and

361
00:17:39,660 --> 00:17:41,420
then someone would say french fries and who goes

362
00:17:41,420 --> 00:17:50,260
that dude loves food. Wait, oh my God and don't get me started about his

363
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:54,820
little bitch nephew scrappy. He's a really poorly trained dog scrappy. No

364
00:17:54,820 --> 00:17:57,880
Scooby. Yeah, no, that's what I was thinking. It's like they should have put

365
00:17:57,880 --> 00:18:01,640
it to. They should have. Do you think it solves? Do you think every crime every

366
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:05,160
every guy? I mean, it's raggy. I feel like I feel like shagging and school.

367
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:09,320
You must have a really strong friendship because if I had a friend who's poop I

368
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:12,960
had to pick up in a plastic bag, I think our relationship will be very strained,

369
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:17,840
but they eat so much food together. He uses the toilet. I don't think he uses

370
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:21,880
toilet he uses the time I don't think he does I wouldn't him yeah he goes outside

371
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:25,940
and Scooby uses the toilet Shaggy cuz Shaggy and Scooby just poop and leave

372
00:18:25,940 --> 00:18:31,440
like it's not that no everybody's gonna be like who's dog Oh Scooby-Doo awesome

373
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:36,760
they're gonna be like that oh Scooby-Doo that's fun oh it's Scooby-Doo's poop

374
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:41,200
yeah I remember you I'm gonna collect this I'm gonna see scooby snacks yeah

375
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:44,720
he's eating straight graham crackers every day I mean I was gonna go everyone

376
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:49,560
also he like a whole turkey. They did. Yeah, I guess the none of them none of

377
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:52,120
them clean up his poop because there was that one episode where they go to jail

378
00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:57,400
because he didn't clean up his poop. Yeah, there is Shaggy and Scooby are both in

379
00:18:57,400 --> 00:19:02,520
at least in the movie both vegetarian. Really? That's not. And Velma wears a

380
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:08,360
thong. Yeah, Velma shows her. Oh my god. And Mr. Bean's name is Mr.

381
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:13,160
Mondavarious of Spooky Island. Oh yeah, Mr. Bean's in that movie.

382
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:17,200
well I'll let mr. free holy in that movie they call him mr. Monde various I'm a

383
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:21,160
Mexican that's where then where did they go in the movie

384
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:27,160
spooky island spooky island in Cancun no no I can't go it's in Mexico no it's not

385

386
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:39,880
sing the outcast sing their national anthem that I was cast song in the land

387
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:43,880
and that that that there is always something going on.

388
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:44,880
We know

389
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:51,880
like I was just guessing as he said I was also guessing the lyrics to the

390
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:52,880
lyrics.

391
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:53,880
We're both guessing the lyrics.

392
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:54,880
That's how it goes.

393
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:55,880
Spooky Island was in Australia.

394
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:56,880
Fuck!

395
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:59,760
Is that the filming location or is that where it actually was supposed to be?

396
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:01,640
Well the filming location was Australia.

397
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:03,880
It says here that there's an Australian girl in it.

398
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:04,880
Remember?

399
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:05,880
Yeah.

400
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:06,880
Well it also it says here that it's a little Fisher.

401
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:07,880
Yeah.

402
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:08,880
She was Australian.

403
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:12,920
says here that the movie though the titular wife of Borat in the movie she

404
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:16,600
is canonically married to Borat yeah

405
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:23,280
she's my husband his name's Borat he's names boring his name's Borat my name is

406
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:29,160
for Tina isn't her name Mary Jane her name is Scooby's wife no way her name's

407
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:37,080
Mary Jane my favorite name yeah did that movie was supposed to be rated R yeah

408
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:41,080
yeah, the film that rated are then they edited it to a PG. I would do anything

409
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:46,280
to see the Velma see all the the the the and freezing the phrasing on the I'm

410
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:49,800
reading spooky spooky island Wikipedia page the phrasing here under notes and

411
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:54,640
trivia. This is the only notes in trivia the the scenes filmed at spooky island

412
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:58,680
were in Australia at Tangalooma Island Resort where over four hundred cast and

413
00:20:58,680 --> 00:21:02,960
crew took over the resort for six weeks and transformed it into an exclusive

414
00:21:02,980 --> 00:21:05,280
don't set the best for

415
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:09,080
Scooby Casting Crew members, but

416
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:11,980
swarming yeah, they do a cool, just

417
00:21:11,980 --> 00:21:14,280
resort climbing, climbing up the

418
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:15,980
building like World War Z. You see

419
00:21:15,980 --> 00:21:16,480
each other.

420
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:18,880
Yeah, there's switching yeah, there

421
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:20,180
yeah, they're like so they're putting

422
00:21:20,180 --> 00:21:22,780
up statues of Mr. Bean everywhere,

423
00:21:22,780 --> 00:21:25,480
like what is this? Yes, separating

424
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:27,180
like parents for the dark opelix

425
00:21:27,180 --> 00:21:27,780
ritual.

426
00:21:27,780 --> 00:21:32,180
Yeah, I want I I wonder how what

427
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:38,800
was what they cut out of the R-rated one. Weed, for sure. Weed, sex,

428
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:45,480
violence, drugs, and they kept in rock and roll.

429
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:49,200
We think they cut out the adult themes maybe. Stark depictions of

430
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:58,240
prejudice. It's Australia, the aboriginals on the island. Yeah, Mr. Bean's character

431
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:02,680
says like and you don't want to go over there.

432
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:07,880
They kept that in but now he's talking about the graveyard.

433
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:14,600
They CGI'd the word "ghosts"

434
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:20,480
They CGI'd the word "indigenous" above. They CGI'd it out.

435
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:29,920
they're turning into invisible yeah yeah yeah Scooby-Doo and then they made a

436
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:34,520
second one - oh my god monsters unleashed and tell you what those movies are good

437
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:37,600
as fuck they're cool they're fun to watch they're really funny

438
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:41,800
Scooby is up to his old tricks in Scooby-Doo - monsters only I would say

439
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:46,880
that I'm laying and I would say I would say the monsters are - yeah but this time

440
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:51,360
they're real. Peter Boyle is more of a Scoob guy. Yeah. Fuck you. Wait, what do you mean

441
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:56,560
more of a Scoob guy? The new movie Scoob. I didn't see it. I didn't see it either. I

442
00:22:56,560 --> 00:23:00,720
didn't see it. My nephew probably saw it. But I grew up on that what's new Scooby Doo

443
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:07,720
shit. Yeah. They got all the Scooby Doo shit on HBO Max dude. I've been sessioning some

444
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:11,040
Scooby Doo. They have a pup named Scooby Doo. Remember when they did that in the 80s they

445
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:15,040
tried to do that. They tried to make every show have a baby version. They have that one

446
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:19,160
that's the live-action like origin story. It's a great way to reboot.

447
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:23,280
I mean it's a great way to sell merch. You ever watch Muppet Babies?

448
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:28,440
What? Yeah of course. I watched so much. We had a Muppets Baby VHS in our, we had a

449
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:33,120
VHS player in our car. We watched the same Star Wars Muppet Babies episode

450
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:39,160
every time we went on like a long trip and then on my birthday when we

451
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:45,380
went to that that seafood place I looked in the bar was playing that Muppet

452
00:23:45,380 --> 00:23:50,560
Babies episode. It was so weird. There's a sign of that it's your that you should

453
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:53,680
get it. It was a sign that it was my birthday. It's a sign that the bar is run by a pedophile.

454
00:23:53,680 --> 00:24:01,400
This is my favorite episode. Can you bring your kids in here? Why does a

455
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:02,740
- Why does a pedophile sound like that?

456
00:24:02,740 --> 00:24:03,580
- What the hell?

457
00:24:03,580 --> 00:24:04,400
- What?

458
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:05,240
- That's your pedophile voice?

459
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:06,240
(laughing)

460
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:09,320
- I just did a pedophile accent.

461
00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:10,960
(laughing)

462
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:12,080
What's wrong with that?

463
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:12,920
(laughing)

464
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:13,760
- Interesting, okay.

465
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:15,800
- That's a regular pedophile's voice.

466
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:18,360
- Well, that's just not where I thought you were gonna go.

467
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:20,280
- You know how the pedophile in your neighborhood

468
00:24:20,280 --> 00:24:21,760
didn't walk up to you and say,

469
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:24,080
I have comic books at my house.

470
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:26,720
He didn't, and you went to his house and...

471
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:28,960
(laughing)

472
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:29,800
- No.

473
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:30,620
- What?

474
00:24:30,620 --> 00:24:37,620
No, I did that. Okay, Alex did that. Alex did that to people. That was a crazy voice. I know exactly what you're talking about.

475
00:24:37,620 --> 00:24:42,620
You know what, believe it or not, we didn't have a neighborhood pedophile growing up.

476
00:24:42,620 --> 00:24:51,620
There was a guy in my neighborhood who was just kind of weird and he tried to, he did try to talk to me about, I didn't get molested,

477
00:24:51,620 --> 00:24:56,960
He tried to talk to me about comic books and stuff and then like I think I was

478
00:24:56,960 --> 00:25:01,780
talking about like X-Men or something and then he just stood there and tried to

479
00:25:01,780 --> 00:25:04,880
like, like it was clear that this is probably just like an old autistic guy

480
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:09,800
and he tried to grill me for an hour and then like, I guess, I was like oh yeah

481
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:14,980
mom that guy that guy talked to me about comic books and he's like she was like

482
00:25:14,980 --> 00:25:18,260
"Oh, the guy who stares at all the young women at the pool?"

483
00:25:18,260 --> 00:25:19,820
(laughter)

484
00:25:19,820 --> 00:25:21,900
And then my mom started calling him Geico.

485
00:25:21,900 --> 00:25:24,740
- It's such a sad world for these old autistic men

486
00:25:24,740 --> 00:25:26,700
who just want to keep up with the times and feel cool,

487
00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:27,780
and they just want to talk to kids

488
00:25:27,780 --> 00:25:29,500
and ask them about comic books and video games

489
00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:30,620
and condom sizes.

490
00:25:30,620 --> 00:25:31,820
(laughter)

491
00:25:31,820 --> 00:25:33,120
It's just tough out there, you know?

492
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:33,960
I feel bad.

493
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:36,020
You have to respect your elders and go to their houses.

494
00:25:36,020 --> 00:25:37,420
- My mom would call him Geico

495
00:25:37,420 --> 00:25:40,100
because of those Geico commercials where they say,

496
00:25:40,100 --> 00:25:42,100
"I always feel like someone's watching me."

497
00:25:42,100 --> 00:25:43,940
- If Michael Jackson wasn't famous

498
00:25:44,940 --> 00:25:48,100
guy with a job who lived in your neighborhood and looked still like that

499
00:25:48,100 --> 00:25:54,380
would you like your yeah yeah like foot like no no no no no no no no no no no

500
00:25:54,380 --> 00:25:59,420
crazy yeah dead bleached skin and he dressed the same would you let your kids

501
00:25:59,420 --> 00:26:03,060
hang out with him if he may if he's still have made a video called thrill

502
00:26:03,060 --> 00:26:08,540
yeah but it's a different video he has neverland in his backyard nope he has

503
00:26:08,540 --> 00:26:15,020
has not he has a he has a DVR. I'm generally it's about all he's got. I'm

504
00:26:15,020 --> 00:26:19,100
generally not going to let my kids hang out with like a an adult that they

505
00:26:19,100 --> 00:26:21,820
don't know. Yeah, what if he's your okay? What if he's your best friend?

506
00:26:21,820 --> 00:26:26,420
Yep, he's your best friend, but he has any as a child care license, but he

507
00:26:26,420 --> 00:26:29,820
also has a pedophile license. Yeah, but you don't know you don't know about it,

508
00:26:29,820 --> 00:26:33,380
but I don't know about it. Okay, every day every day to file licenses is

509
00:26:33,380 --> 00:26:36,180
printed on the back of his child care license at one time. He dropped his

510
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:39,000
childcare license and he went don't look at that and you're like you didn't

511
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:42,100
because you were such good friends with him yeah. So with this hypothetical in

512
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:44,800
mind would you let your kid go over there and eat a spaghetti dinner. This is

513
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:48,700
a cautionary tale of the the power of this is what if you had it's not okay

514
00:26:48,700 --> 00:26:53,400
we made up story. What if you okay would you let your kid go over and have a

515
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:56,500
spaghetti dinner with him if you had a hundred other kids. No they weren't

516
00:26:56,500 --> 00:27:01,800
gonna go. I love all my kids equally. Oh no it's tough. I had to go around you

517
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:04,900
know, but I also I need to like I need to put him to the friendship test. You

518
00:27:04,900 --> 00:27:07,120
I need to see what he's all about.

519
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:09,100
I need to see how I am a friend.

520
00:27:09,100 --> 00:27:10,180
- Can we do that right now?

521
00:27:10,180 --> 00:27:12,420
What's the friendship test?

522
00:27:12,420 --> 00:27:17,420
- I think it's like a dinner, it's like breakfast,

523
00:27:17,420 --> 00:27:19,580
it's an activity.

524
00:27:19,580 --> 00:27:21,820
- It's food, it's a lot of food.

525
00:27:21,820 --> 00:27:23,080
- Wait, dinner and then breakfast,

526
00:27:23,080 --> 00:27:24,620
so a spend the night in the middle?

527
00:27:24,620 --> 00:27:26,020
- No, no, no, they're separate.

528
00:27:26,020 --> 00:27:27,700
It's like separate tests.

529
00:27:27,700 --> 00:27:29,640
- You have to do trials.

530
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:31,760
- You guys have all been through these,

531
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:32,660
you know, inadvertently.

532
00:27:32,660 --> 00:27:34,040
I'm not actually trying to do it,

533
00:27:34,040 --> 00:27:38,040
I've had breakfast with all of you. I've had dinner with all of you. Oh my god. He was setting us up

534
00:27:38,040 --> 00:27:41,560
Great I got tricked into being your friend

535
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:50,000
Activities with you I didn't realize I was doing this whole I didn't realize it was a test I did

536
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,080
Yeah, I was curious why you brought a clipboard

537
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:57,880
Speaking of Cameron you're in the 96% activities

538
00:27:57,880 --> 00:28:03,680
But 33rd on breakfast, so we're gonna need to go numbers. No, right. I would be the other way around

539
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:08,320
around. I'm great at getting breakfast. I'm bad at activities. I feel like I

540
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:11,600
would honestly I would probably say you're better about watching a movie. I

541
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:14,080
don't even know if I've ever gotten breakfast with you. I think we've gotten

542
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:17,960
breakfast before. We went and got breakfast at the Taco Bell on the way to

543
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:23,480
the lake. Oh yeah. Damn. Oh yeah. That wasn't breakfast though. That doesn't

544
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:28,440
count. A friend's breakfast is at a diner. Yeah exactly. I've had breakfast with you.

545
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:32,560
And it's all about splitting the check. That's the real thing. I don't know.

546
00:28:32,560 --> 00:28:39,840
the test. You know what I watched last night? We're not friends. Did a rewatch

547
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:46,680
butterfly effect. Oh so good. So it's the it's the fucking like I realized last

548
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:56,560
night. You just did it. So good. Yeah we do that. It's one of those things like where it's just so really good.

549
00:28:56,560 --> 00:29:05,520
It's just so really it's like that movie is in like the same like criteria is

550
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:08,000
like a mortal technique dance with the devil.

551
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:08,720
Yeah, it is.

552
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:12,600
It's like your friend's older brother shows you that movie and he's like, like

553
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:15,280
you accidentally watch it or your friend's older brother shows it to you.

554
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:18,480
And it's like, this is the most fucked up thing you're ever going to see.

555
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:18,760
Yeah.

556
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:23,080
Cause that movie, like literally every scene is just like, here's like the most

557
00:29:23,080 --> 00:29:25,280
twisted fucked up thing we can think of.

558
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:29,360
he has a fat goth roommate who fucks.

559
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:32,200
Is that the guy from uh... Ethan Suplee, yeah.

560
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:33,300
Scientologist.

561
00:29:33,300 --> 00:29:37,460
Scientologist? For real? Yeah. Damn, that makes my name as Earl make sense, because Jason Lee

562
00:29:37,460 --> 00:29:42,060
used to be a part of the faith. Probably got him hooked on it. Yep, maybe. It is addictive.

563
00:29:42,060 --> 00:29:47,720
Yeah. I want to do it so badly. Yeah, I would love to. Do you want to do a butterfly effect?

564
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:52,180
No, I want to do Dianetics. He wants to do the duck butterfly effect. He wants to save a woman from an

565
00:29:52,180 --> 00:29:54,500
explosion. You're sinking in so much money into the church

566
00:29:54,500 --> 00:29:58,500

sign we should start our we should choose a book to start our own

582
00:30:42,220 --> 00:30:46,940
Scientology we need to change it to the - so it's just normal Christianity gets

583
00:30:46,940 --> 00:30:52,100
you everything in Hollywood it's crazy that every Scientologist is the most

584
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:56,420
beautiful person in the world. Every Scientologist is like the most beautiful person.

585
00:30:56,420 --> 00:30:57,380
Not Elizabeth Moss.

586
00:30:57,380 --> 00:31:00,180
Elizabeth Moss is the...

587
00:31:00,180 --> 00:31:03,060
She was the blueprint, yo.

588
00:31:03,060 --> 00:31:03,940
Yeah, she was.

589
00:31:03,940 --> 00:31:07,860
Andy Dick.

590
00:31:07,860 --> 00:31:10,340
Oh my god.

591
00:31:10,340 --> 00:31:12,340
Have you seen that video?

592
00:31:12,340 --> 00:31:14,420
I sent it to Cameron.

593
00:31:14,420 --> 00:31:19,220
I sent it to Cameron. Did I send it to you guys?

594
00:31:19,220 --> 00:31:21,540
Just the caption of that video made me laugh.

595
00:31:21,540 --> 00:31:25,140
It's a video Andy Dick got the shit kicked out of him in Las Vegas.

596
00:31:25,140 --> 00:31:29,220
It said, it was like a video that had one of those like built-in captions that's like on the video.

597
00:31:29,220 --> 00:31:29,460
Yeah.

598
00:31:29,460 --> 00:31:32,180
It's in giant letters, "Andy Dick beaten to a pulp."

599
00:31:32,180 --> 00:31:37,540
And it's a video of him and he's like, his face is just like all puffy and he's like,

600
00:31:37,540 --> 00:31:45,220
"I don't even know what happened. Oh, I just, I don't know about the ground."

601
00:31:45,220 --> 00:31:47,060
He probably tried to finger a bouncer.

602
00:31:47,060 --> 00:31:50,500
Yeah, no, and then the woman, the woman's like, the woman interviewing him is like,

603
00:31:51,060 --> 00:31:54,060
Andy, Andy, what did they look like?

00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:13,040
- Beat to a pulp.

613
00:32:13,040 --> 00:32:14,920
- Cat Williams getting beaten up by the 12 year old.

00:32:14,920 --> 00:32:16,520

00:33:16,700 --> 00:33:19,500
to her for the rest of the episode and he's like, "Do you cook for your kids?"

629
00:33:19,500 --> 00:33:23,420
And she's like, "Yeah, I make a really good broccoli." And he's like, "Huh?"

630
00:33:23,420 --> 00:33:27,820
I love him, dude. He's so fucking funny.

631
00:33:27,820 --> 00:33:32,020
There's no way you could fuck up broccoli. I fuck up broccoli.

632
00:33:32,020 --> 00:33:34,020
Dude, I fuck up some broccoli if you put it in front of me.

633
00:33:34,020 --> 00:33:36,620
Dude, I made steaks the other night. Whoa.

634
00:33:36,620 --> 00:33:37,620
They were the worst. Do tell.

635
00:33:37,620 --> 00:33:41,820
They sucked. That was the second time I ever tried cooking a steak and I have no

636
00:33:41,820 --> 00:33:45,060
idea how to cook a steak. So I watched some video and it was like...

637
00:33:45,060 --> 00:33:47,220
You need a thermometer and you need a smoker.

638
00:33:47,220 --> 00:33:48,500
Well, it was just saying like...

639
00:33:48,500 --> 00:33:49,100
$600 worth of materials.

640
00:33:49,100 --> 00:33:51,300
It was telling you how long to sear it on either side.

641
00:33:51,300 --> 00:33:53,740
But I bought... I didn't even think about this.

642
00:33:53,740 --> 00:33:56,620
I bought like the thinnest steak that I used.

643
00:33:56,620 --> 00:33:57,820
It was like this thin.

644
00:33:57,820 --> 00:33:58,540
You stupid, stupid idiot.

645
00:33:58,540 --> 00:34:00,460
So, it was just like a piece of fucking jerky, dude.

646
00:34:00,460 --> 00:34:01,420
It sucked.

647
00:34:01,420 --> 00:34:02,020
I remember that.

648
00:34:02,020 --> 00:34:02,740
You bought a flank steak?

649
00:34:02,740 --> 00:34:04,060
No, it was a prime rib.

650
00:34:04,060 --> 00:34:06,500
Oh, air fryer salmon, very delicious.

651
00:34:06,500 --> 00:34:07,540
Is the air fryer working?

652
00:34:07,540 --> 00:34:09,580
I haven't cooked meat in like years.

653
00:34:09,580 --> 00:34:11,620
Yeah, I have a big ass annoying one too.

654
00:34:11,620 --> 00:34:12,180
It's great.

655
00:34:12,180 --> 00:34:14,860
We just got a toaster oven with our apartment for free.

656
00:34:14,860 --> 00:34:18,980
that's actually using that they are yes as for what i was running on

657
00:34:18,980 --> 00:34:19,940
for what it's

658
00:34:19,940 --> 00:34:22,980
movement that you're talking about a toaster i remember and i wanted to bring

659
00:34:22,980 --> 00:34:25,660
the toaster oven here and then i realized you know it's a little

660
00:34:25,660 --> 00:34:29,660
convection oven one of the yet yet the front now can get it as basically an air

661
00:34:29,660 --> 00:34:31,020
for i've been put it yet

662
00:34:31,020 --> 00:34:34,100
now it's like an air fryer with more things the power of air

663
00:34:34,100 --> 00:34:35,300
yeah out of

664
00:34:35,300 --> 00:34:37,460
power can't find anything in it metal

665
00:34:37,460 --> 00:34:41,340
yet uses metal instead of our you know for transformers

666
00:34:41,340 --> 00:34:42,540
i think i'm gonna be good

667
00:34:42,540 --> 00:34:44,060
s'mores in it

668
00:34:44,060 --> 00:34:45,940
yes it's a good idea more is that our apartment

669
00:34:45,940 --> 00:34:48,180
yeah little fire washable fire

670
00:34:48,180 --> 00:34:51,480
the bonfire is this is the first it's like

671
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:52,780
the

672
00:34:52,780 --> 00:34:54,260
the hot hot hot

673
00:34:54,260 --> 00:34:58,420
so it is goes up the other railing like a few years ago i got out of my

674
00:34:58,420 --> 00:34:59,740
life

675
00:34:59,740 --> 00:35:02,980
is like this is a remix of the

676
00:35:02,980 --> 00:35:05,180
it's got a insulated your room with good

677
00:35:05,180 --> 00:35:09,260
i think i think this point is a prize for the idea and

678
00:35:09,260 --> 00:35:10,260
You can't fucking--

679
00:35:10,260 --> 00:35:12,260
Dude, your apartments are so fucking dark, dude.

680
00:35:12,260 --> 00:35:15,260
It echoes so much in our apartment.

681
00:35:15,260 --> 00:35:16,260
Firework.

682
00:35:16,260 --> 00:35:19,260
My girlfriend was in my room, and I was in the bathroom.

683
00:35:19,260 --> 00:35:23,260
And I went to the bathroom because it was the first couple of weeks

684
00:35:23,260 --> 00:35:26,260
we were seeing each other, and I didn't want to fart in front of her.

685
00:35:26,260 --> 00:35:28,260
And I was in the bathroom trying to hide a fart.

686
00:35:28,260 --> 00:35:30,260
That's a necessary detail.

687
00:35:30,260 --> 00:35:32,260
Yeah, it's a necessary detail.

688
00:35:32,260 --> 00:35:37,260
I was trying to hide a fart, and it was so long and loud

689
00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:44,280
In the other side of the apartment, I think that's certainly a you problem. I heard I heard her in my room go

690
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:46,980
What the fuck?

691
00:35:46,980 --> 00:35:49,900
Wait, so your complaint is my apartment is so bad

692
00:35:49,900 --> 00:35:58,360
That my supersonic fart was hurt on the other side. You shouldn't be able to hear a fart from the other side of your part

693
00:35:58,360 --> 00:36:00,360
I got really

694
00:36:00,360 --> 00:36:05,740
It depends on how loud it doesn't matter you can hear anything at any distance if it's loud enough

695
00:36:05,740 --> 00:36:09,060
I think you can also like I had the door shut you're not supposed to hear anything

696
00:36:09,060 --> 00:36:12,500
But you went to the bathroom, but then you you ripped it like you let it loose

697
00:36:12,500 --> 00:36:18,780
You have to still like try to spread a butt cheek. I didn't spread the bush red would make it quieter. Yeah

698
00:36:18,780 --> 00:36:24,460
That's what you do what I did not hurt something you supposed to if you spread oh my god, dude

699
00:36:24,460 --> 00:36:27,660
I got so good at doing that in class like not even just hands-free just spread

700
00:36:27,660 --> 00:36:31,500
Yeah, yeah, completely take apart and then farting and then making a face like

701
00:36:31,500 --> 00:36:39,000
like who did that pointing at hand up? Did you hate anyone else smell that it

702
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:43,520
actually smells like fucking fart all around me right now. I just there is

703
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:48,800
nothing funnier than just like a quiet room and so that in high school that

704
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:52,660
only happened my like entire school up to college that only happened one time

705
00:36:52,660 --> 00:36:55,540
this kid this kid farted. It was the probably because it was only happened

706
00:36:55,540 --> 00:36:59,820
one time was like the funniest thing I've ever experienced. It was my sat this

707
00:36:59,840 --> 00:37:02,800
in front of me. You're not allowed to talk or make any noise or you get like whatever.

708
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:03,200
Yeah.

709
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:05,920
The test gets thrown out and this girl in front of me like sneezed and it was like

710
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:06,320
*fart noise*

711
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:07,200
*laughter*

712
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:07,920
So loud.

713
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:09,280
It pushed out the fart, the sneeze?

714
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:10,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

715
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,120
Wait, that's a combo.

716
00:37:11,120 --> 00:37:11,520
Dude, that's awesome.

717
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:13,520
That you know exactly why she farted too.

718
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:14,000
No, yeah, yeah.

719
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:14,080
That's so awesome.

720
00:37:14,080 --> 00:37:17,920
The worst is when you're like just alone with somebody and then you laugh really,

721
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:21,040
you're laying down, you laugh really hard and just one slips out.

722
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:21,680
Never happened to me.

723
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:22,160
That happened to me.

724
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:22,640
Yeah, that doesn't happen to me either.

725
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:24,000
When you're laying down alone with someone.

726
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,320
*laughter*

727
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:28,080
Yeah, that happened to me a couple nights ago.

728
00:37:28,080 --> 00:37:30,340
(laughing)

729
00:37:30,340 --> 00:37:31,160
- Laying down on your own.

730
00:37:31,160 --> 00:37:32,000
(laughing)

731
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,160
- Laying down and farting.

732
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:36,200
- That sentence made sense in my head.

733
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:38,200
- And you giggle so much that you fart.

734
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:40,440
(laughing)

735
00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:45,240
- I'm not having a good one today.

736
00:37:45,240 --> 00:37:46,080
My brain's not on.

737
00:37:46,080 --> 00:37:48,440
- That is such a funny mental image.

738
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:50,040
- You want some guava or anything?

739
00:37:50,040 --> 00:37:50,880
- Stranger.

740
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:51,700
(laughing)

741
00:37:51,700 --> 00:37:53,920
- Stranger, I'm laying on my belly.

742
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:55,440
I'm just like watching something on my phone.

743
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:56,280
- Laying on your belly.

744
00:37:56,280 --> 00:37:57,840
- With my feet up in the air.

745
00:37:57,840 --> 00:38:00,680
- On the train, on the seats of the train.

746
00:38:00,680 --> 00:38:02,520
- I'm watching like a YouTube video

747
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:04,520
and I'm just going, "He he he he he he."

748
00:38:04,520 --> 00:38:06,400
(laughing)

749
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:07,960
- Look at the other guy in the train.

750
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:09,120
- Oops, oopsie.

751
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:12,880
- Yeah.

752
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:14,360
- Did you hear that?

753
00:38:14,360 --> 00:38:15,360
- Please tell me you didn't hear that,

754
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:17,320
but we've all been there, right?

755
00:38:17,320 --> 00:38:19,080
- I'm sorry. - Not me though.

756
00:38:19,080 --> 00:38:20,960
- You have to get off the next stop.

757
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:21,800
- Yeah.

758
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:24,440
- Dude, I never farted so bad.

759
00:38:24,440 --> 00:38:27,520

Escobar, because I used to I used to fart in columbia

762
00:38:34,420 --> 00:38:41,400
I used to fart in class when I was in third grade and I had a you used to

763
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:47,000
agree to leave the room whenever I want. They were they were like you such a

764
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:51,520
distracting, but then she gave me the power to leave the classroom and also

765
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:54,480
the association of like when he leaves the classroom. It means he's farting

766
00:38:55,840 --> 00:39:00,960
I took it. It's awful. Did it's pretty cool. Are you the class clown with the

767
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:05,200
farts for sure? Yeah, you're the class farter than you weren't a clown. Yeah,

768
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:09,380
clown doesn't fart. I was a clown. I can have some of the time doesn't eat or

769
00:39:09,380 --> 00:39:11,040
drink. I was a class slave.

770
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:17,920
No, you weren't. Yeah, it was. No, I got forced to do stuff. Did you do homework?

771
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:22,400
What the hell is this? What did you get? My my move in in class is always I

772
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:26,960
everyone thought it was funny when I jumped over a desk. I was just like I

773
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:30,520
like just fall a jumper doesn't fall all the time. I remember one time I

774
00:39:30,520 --> 00:39:33,200
following is a pretty big. I was a smart board wizard. I

775
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:35,920
would do yeah

776
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:43,160
more stuff was funny. I would do that, too. I remember one time I didn't have

777
00:39:43,160 --> 00:39:46,920
a smart board me and my friend. We were like giving a presentation in like our

778
00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:50,200
French class and they're on the smart board and we both started pressing the

779
00:39:50,240 --> 00:39:53,980
smart for the same time and it somehow like brought up the on screen keyboard

780
00:39:53,980 --> 00:39:58,800
and also just like filled the entire screen with this random letters and we

781
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:02,560
are laughing so hard to we got in trouble. Nice it was pretty funny. I

782
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:06,220
didn't have a smart where we had a piece of wood. You didn't have a piece of

783
00:40:06,220 --> 00:40:09,520
wood. We had a piece of what is called damn pencil. We didn't burn. We didn't

784
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:15,640
even have pencils. Yeah, we had we had clay. We had to use people. You're so

785
00:40:15,660 --> 00:40:16,660
fucking stupid.

786
00:40:16,660 --> 00:40:17,660
It actually is.

787
00:40:17,660 --> 00:40:18,660
I used our blood to make the vampire academy.

788
00:40:18,660 --> 00:40:19,660
I used our blood to make the vampire academy.

789
00:40:19,660 --> 00:40:20,660
I used our blood to make the vampire academy.

790
00:40:20,660 --> 00:40:21,660
Wood and clay and leaves.

791
00:40:21,660 --> 00:40:23,060
I should do that.

792
00:40:23,060 --> 00:40:24,660
Top ten proofs the Illuminati is real.

793
00:40:24,660 --> 00:40:25,660
Oh yeah I forgot there was a list that goes on.

794
00:40:25,660 --> 00:40:28,460
Anyways these are theories on how the Illuminati is real.

795
00:40:28,460 --> 00:40:31,140
Warning this may or may not be a really stupid list.

796
00:40:31,140 --> 00:40:34,260
I didn't realize your phone was balanced on your foot and I was like whoa.

797
00:40:34,260 --> 00:40:36,660
You just like memorized that.

798
00:40:36,660 --> 00:40:38,980
We're waiting for your chance.

799
00:40:38,980 --> 00:40:40,660
That would be sick.

800
00:40:40,660 --> 00:40:45,060
Number one Obama's forehead is in the shape of a triangle.

801
00:40:45,060 --> 00:40:49,140
one I believe I believe this one I'm gonna double yeah I'm not sure I believe

802
00:40:49,140 --> 00:40:54,920
that is Obama's forehead Obama's forehead I feel like a triangle forehead is

803
00:40:54,920 --> 00:40:58,420
something I would have noticed by now you'd think that they would show a photo

804
00:40:58,420 --> 00:41:03,420
Obama's got to be like a person who isn't someone I know in real life that

805
00:41:03,420 --> 00:41:07,380
I've seen a picture I've seen him in person I've seen so many pictures of

806
00:41:07,380 --> 00:41:12,960
Obama yeah so I've seen Obama in person oh yeah madam two so's he was standing

807
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:19,080
there. He kind of does have a there's like a show me the triangle. Let me see it's

808
00:41:19,080 --> 00:41:22,760
not shaped like a triangle but he kind of has like a triangle you see that so like

809
00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:25,760
kind of discoloration where it's like eyebrows meet. Yeah I'd say that's

810
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:29,640
probably a lighting thing though. Yeah but on this photo. It sure does look like it.

811
00:41:29,640 --> 00:41:37,120
Do you think they're talking about this photo specifically or does he always have that? I don't know. Let me check some other. Look up Obama's triangle. This one he's got a damn fly on his head.

812
00:41:37,120 --> 00:41:42,400
That's Mike Pence. Remind you of anybody? Yeah, Mike Pence. Oh, that's Mike Pence. Whoops.

813
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:47,660
Uh, no, I don't really see a triangle. Wait a second. I just saw, I just found this photo

814
00:41:47,660 --> 00:41:53,640
of him. Whoa. This could actually, I mean, that's, see, everybody's talking about the

815
00:41:53,640 --> 00:41:59,560
triangle hair. Nobody's talking about this. Obama's hair is made out of grown chia seeds.

816
00:41:59,560 --> 00:42:05,080
Yeah, that is true. I've seen him on the commercials with that. Yeah. No one is talking about this.

817
00:42:05,080 --> 00:42:12,240
look right here he has green chia seed hair oh my god damn he's got to be in

818
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:18,200
the Illuminati yeah yeah or the top look it seems like every president that we've

819
00:42:18,200 --> 00:42:22,920
ever had has had green chia seed hair here's Donald Trump in a clear it do you

820
00:42:22,920 --> 00:42:26,680
think you think it has to do with the Joker no I don't think serene hair I

821
00:42:26,680 --> 00:42:31,760
don't think I'm a red face I think the Illuminati I mean look at this

822
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:34,600
- One of our most famous presidents.

823
00:42:34,600 --> 00:42:35,440
- Is that?

824
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:36,900
- That is, um.

825
00:42:36,900 --> 00:42:38,820
- Robert O'Kamiyagi?

826
00:42:38,820 --> 00:42:40,080
- No.

827
00:42:40,080 --> 00:42:40,920
- No, just guess.

828
00:42:40,920 --> 00:42:43,580
- Keep guessing Asian guys, go.

829
00:42:43,580 --> 00:42:44,900
- That is president. - Tiger Woods.

830
00:42:44,900 --> 00:42:45,740
I'm a good guy.

831
00:42:45,740 --> 00:42:46,720
(laughing)

832
00:42:46,720 --> 00:42:48,500
I'm a really good guy, I guess Tiger Woods.

833
00:42:48,500 --> 00:42:50,680
- That is President Don Johnson.

834
00:42:50,680 --> 00:42:52,520
- No, that's an SJW.

835
00:42:52,520 --> 00:42:54,220
- That's the next president.

836
00:42:54,220 --> 00:42:56,560
This is actually the person--

837
00:42:56,560 --> 00:42:57,400
- Put that away.

838
00:42:57,400 --> 00:42:59,000
- Yeah, 'cause Biden's not getting a second term.

839
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:00,720
- You know when you were a kid and you didn't know who the,

840
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:04,400
like you didn't know who any of the people were in. I wish I liked when I

841
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:08,200
when the person who was running was just a stranger. Yeah, I have I have a

842
00:43:08,200 --> 00:43:14,760
really distinct memory of I didn't really know who who Dick Cheney was

843
00:43:14,760 --> 00:43:19,600
really when like Obama was Obama was being like sworn in or whatever and my

844
00:43:19,600 --> 00:43:24,960
grandfather was at our house and he was like he like he turned to me. He turned

845
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:28,060
to me and was like like oh like Dick Cheney's not at the ceremony. He's

846
00:43:28,080 --> 00:43:31,080
probably out. He's probably a torturing someone right now, like just trying to

847
00:43:31,080 --> 00:43:34,820
get one at the last minute and I was like I don't like who is that home for the

848
00:43:34,820 --> 00:43:38,440
inauguration. I feel like that was a school day. There's a kid in my I don't

849
00:43:38,440 --> 00:43:41,420
know yeah, that was a school day. I watched it at home to it might have been

850
00:43:41,420 --> 00:43:43,480
it might have been after you were going to say like something you weren't. I

851
00:43:43,480 --> 00:43:46,860
don't think I was watching. That's what I was expecting to maybe I wasn't

852
00:43:46,860 --> 00:43:50,100
watching it live. I was definitely because my grandfather was not at school.

853
00:43:50,100 --> 00:43:50,920
I can tell you that

854
00:43:53,960 --> 00:43:57,860
I feel he map is a tiny little shirt on Cameron. I need a ride home.

855
00:43:57,860 --> 00:44:04,480
Please. I remember there's this kid in my sixth grade class and he said in

856
00:44:04,480 --> 00:44:09,280
front of the whole class after Obama's inauguration, he's like the whole time I

857
00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:10,260
was waiting here.

858
00:44:10,260 --> 00:44:16,840
Jesus and everyone was just like just looking at him and like he got

859
00:44:16,840 --> 00:44:21,160
reprimanded pretty hard, but I was like damn yeah. You my friend there were

860
00:44:21,280 --> 00:44:25,500
have a future in the CIA. What were dad says though and then you're yeah yeah

861
00:44:25,500 --> 00:44:29,920
that sounds cool to say yeah there was there were some people at in my town who

862
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:33,420
would sit in front of the post office with a table with like clipboards and

863
00:44:33,420 --> 00:44:35,900
they would have a big banner on the front of their table as a picture of

864
00:44:35,900 --> 00:44:40,940
Obama with a Hitler mustache. Yeah, yeah, that I did it he would yeah. I mean

865
00:44:40,940 --> 00:44:43,660
hey they got shoot the hell out yeah.

866
00:44:43,660 --> 00:44:46,460
There were kids no no

867
00:44:47,800 --> 00:44:50,000
Number two, Jeff, fuel can't melt steel beams.

868
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:50,840
- Oh, hell no.

869
00:44:50,840 --> 00:44:53,160
- I don't think that has much to do with the Illuminati.

870
00:44:53,160 --> 00:44:54,000
- No.

871
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:54,820
- It seems like the comments on these

872
00:44:54,820 --> 00:44:55,660
are saying the same thing.

873
00:44:55,660 --> 00:44:57,360
- This is a bit something that a normal person

874
00:44:57,360 --> 00:44:58,320
wouldn't think about, though.

875
00:44:58,320 --> 00:45:00,280
I think you're rather weird if you're into

876
00:45:00,280 --> 00:45:01,120
this type of stuff.

877
00:45:01,120 --> 00:45:01,940
- Yeah.

878
00:45:01,940 --> 00:45:02,780
- Regardless of what you believe,

879
00:45:02,780 --> 00:45:04,200
what the hell does this have to do with the Illuminati?

880
00:45:04,200 --> 00:45:07,680
- Here's something I saw on a sticker one time.

881
00:45:07,680 --> 00:45:09,840
Dank memes melt steel beams.

882
00:45:09,840 --> 00:45:10,720
- Could that be true?

883
00:45:10,720 --> 00:45:11,560
- That's another clue.

884
00:45:11,560 --> 00:45:13,960
- That's a sticker I saw at a restaurant.

885
00:45:13,960 --> 00:45:14,800
- Wait, guys.

886
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:16,080
- I saw it in a restaurant bathroom.

887
00:45:16,080 --> 00:45:19,400
Number three is kind of making me think more about the Obama one. Number three,

888
00:45:19,400 --> 00:45:23,400
there are triangles in the Nazi swastika. First comment,

889
00:45:23,400 --> 00:45:27,680
you mean the symbol Hitler stole from the Buddhists? No, the other one.

890
00:45:27,680 --> 00:45:30,440
I mean, that's, yeah.

891
00:45:30,440 --> 00:45:35,760
All right, let's draw one on, on Cameron's face. Okay.

892
00:45:35,760 --> 00:45:39,160
We just got to let's count the triangle. Seriously don't guys stop.

893
00:45:39,160 --> 00:45:41,640
Well, it's more of like, there's a square.

894
00:45:44,240 --> 00:45:48,600
is a circle I would say. There's a square who's using that as a symbol of power.

895
00:45:48,600 --> 00:45:52,040
Listen guys, I wouldn't know because I've never even seen one.

896
00:45:52,040 --> 00:45:55,640
I don't know what they look like. Right angles are triangles.

897
00:45:55,640 --> 00:46:04,640
Yep. What are you a fucking Nazi? I mean if you make a little line. Here's an

898
00:46:04,640 --> 00:46:10,640
interesting theory here. Every triangle has three. What's the theory? Number four

899
00:46:10,640 --> 00:46:16,320
the USA won its independence in a way too convenient year.

900
00:46:16,320 --> 00:46:22,480
That's just true. Yeah. That's facts. I think it's just because they literally won in 1776.

901
00:46:22,480 --> 00:46:29,120
1776 just looks good on paper. Yeah. And on July 4th, Independence Day.

902
00:46:29,120 --> 00:46:31,760
On July 4th, no less. It's almost like they set it all up.

903
00:46:31,760 --> 00:46:36,240
Yeah. I will say 1776 does look really good in like pin font.

904
00:46:36,240 --> 00:46:39,920
Yeah. In cursive. The Dutch 7 in general is pretty fancy.

905
00:46:39,920 --> 00:46:48,240
They did it really good. 1776 was like the the cool S. Dude it would have been way better if it was 1777.

906
00:46:48,240 --> 00:46:52,560
No. That's an angel number. They should have waited. That's not an angel number. You always

907
00:46:52,560 --> 00:46:56,400
say things are angel numbers that aren't angel numbers and I'm calling you out. 777 is an angel number.

908
00:46:56,400 --> 00:47:01,600
777 is but 1777 is not. It's three of the same number in a row. But there's an angel number inside of that.

909
00:47:01,600 --> 00:47:08,560
So what about 12 12 12? No. What about 111222? So that's two angel numbers.

910
00:47:08,560 --> 00:47:11,160
that's to air their numbers of the angels.

911
00:47:11,160 --> 00:47:16,160
They're lucky numbers. If you see that means that angels getting in contact

912
00:47:16,160 --> 00:47:16,660
with you.

913
00:47:16,660 --> 00:47:19,860
Joseph Gordon-Levitt like if you look at like the clock and it says

914
00:47:19,860 --> 00:47:20,760
444.

915
00:47:20,760 --> 00:47:21,660
I love it. Press record.

916
00:47:21,660 --> 00:47:22,860
They all mean hit record.

917
00:47:22,860 --> 00:47:26,360
Joe Joseph Gordon-Levitt Batman Dark Knight Rises.

918
00:47:26,360 --> 00:47:27,660
Yep.

919
00:47:27,660 --> 00:47:33,760
Joseph Gordon-Levitt Gordon-Levitt the adjustment Bureau Joseph Gordon-Levitt

920
00:47:33,760 --> 00:47:35,960
third rock from the Sun Joseph.

921
00:47:35,960 --> 00:47:38,060
Did you guys know he's he's Bruce Willis's brother?

922
00:47:38,160 --> 00:47:40,160
Bruce Willis is dead at the end of Sixth Sense.

923
00:47:40,160 --> 00:47:42,160
I just made that up.

924
00:47:42,160 --> 00:47:44,160
He tried to look like his brother in Looper.

925
00:47:44,160 --> 00:47:46,160
That's my impression of that motherfucker.

926
00:47:46,160 --> 00:47:48,160
Joe Golo.

927
00:47:48,160 --> 00:47:50,160
I'm kidding.

928
00:47:50,160 --> 00:47:52,160
What was the movie they did together?

929
00:47:52,160 --> 00:47:54,160
Looper.

930
00:47:54,160 --> 00:47:56,160
Where they were like, "Just Gwen Leavitt."

931
00:47:56,160 --> 00:47:58,160
"Do chipmunk cheeks."

932
00:47:58,160 --> 00:48:00,160
They made him look crazy.

933
00:48:00,160 --> 00:48:02,160
He looks fucked up.

934
00:48:02,160 --> 00:48:04,160
He looks like a failed clone of Bruce Willis.

935
00:48:04,160 --> 00:48:06,160
The point of that is to make him look like Bruce Willis.

936
00:48:06,160 --> 00:48:10,320
Bruce Willis he doesn't look anything like he looks like like they should have

937
00:48:10,320 --> 00:48:14,400
shaved his head you know when they you know when they do like like it's like oh

938
00:48:14,400 --> 00:48:19,360
we use like AI to recreate this cartoon yeah yeah that's what it would look like

939
00:48:19,360 --> 00:48:24,640
if you took Bruce Wayne from Batman the animated series and made him into like

940
00:48:24,640 --> 00:48:30,560
an AI human that's real life Batman realistic Homer but with animated series

941
00:48:30,560 --> 00:48:34,320
Batman looks like JGL and I wish that realistic Homer was actually done with

942
00:48:34,320 --> 00:48:37,260
computer like if there was actually a program that you could put a picture of

943
00:48:37,260 --> 00:48:40,800
Homer and it would make me a little Homer yeah I really like those things

944
00:48:40,800 --> 00:48:43,160
that was because that was what I always whenever I saw that picture in like

945
00:48:43,160 --> 00:48:45,780
middle school or whatever I would believe there's like oh you can just take

946
00:48:45,780 --> 00:48:48,640
there's some program out there you can put a cartoon into and it will make a

947
00:48:48,640 --> 00:48:56,640
real person out of it yeah have you guys seen realistic Woody no that was cool as

948
00:48:56,640 --> 00:49:02,320
hell have you seen it's very cool have you seen realistic Heath Ledger I think

949
00:49:02,320 --> 00:49:09,840
so they make him look like he's a Joker for Batman that's scary yeah they get

950
00:49:09,840 --> 00:49:14,400
they get his they get the Joker's smile wrong though because it's a on this one

951
00:49:14,400 --> 00:49:19,160
yeah I like I like number five here you know I'm gonna be it doesn't look so

952
00:49:19,160 --> 00:49:22,760
realistic to me it's not realistic but it's like a fun and it's real other

953
00:49:22,760 --> 00:49:26,760
characters and I see it actor the evil prospector Wow stuck in his day looks

954
00:49:26,760 --> 00:49:33,400
very realistic. It looks like those books that was like "Who was Woody?" Yeah yeah yeah.

955
00:49:33,400 --> 00:49:38,680
This is realistic. I could see myself walking in the bar. Here's a conspiracy here.

956
00:49:38,680 --> 00:49:42,560
He kind of looks like my dad. Guys. Yeah what's the conspiracy? Number five

957
00:49:42,560 --> 00:49:49,120
conspiracy on this list. President Bush. Yep. Mm-hmm. Oh what? Oh he was a bad

958
00:49:49,120 --> 00:49:53,440
president but surely he was more likely to be a bent politician than an Illuminati

959
00:49:53,440 --> 00:49:59,520
member from mr. veteran Bush was a beast so many things he did it was funny 9/11

960
00:49:59,520 --> 00:50:03,600
Katrina and do you get oil from Iraq to please his Illuminati overlord he has

961
00:50:03,600 --> 00:50:08,680
one of the best president moments of all time yeah where he's like where he's on

962
00:50:08,680 --> 00:50:12,800
the golf course and he's like everyone's like we're going to find we're going to

963
00:50:12,800 --> 00:50:16,520
find Saddam Hussein we're gonna find his mess weapons of mass destruction we're

964
00:50:16,520 --> 00:50:20,000
gonna destroy them now watch this drive and then he just hits the golf ball so

965
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:23,840
That is so sick. It's so cool. He's paying homage to his favorite movie, Happy Gilmore.

966
00:50:23,840 --> 00:50:27,360
I think it was a Happy Gilmore thing. Because I think now he interns for

967
00:50:27,360 --> 00:50:30,880
Happy Madison. Oh good for him. Yeah, it's probably because of that. He's just trying

968
00:50:30,880 --> 00:50:34,560
to rise up through the ranks. I thought he was doing a Bagger Vance thing. Oh maybe he was,

969
00:50:34,560 --> 00:50:37,920
it was probably both. Yeah. It was probably a little bit of both. He's got like magic powers

970
00:50:37,920 --> 00:50:41,520
like Will Smith in that movie. Yeah, Bagger Vance is real actually, I met him once. What?

971
00:50:41,520 --> 00:50:47,600
I mean, are you guys saying Hitch? Or not Hitch? Hitch? That guy's real too. Hancock?

972
00:50:47,600 --> 00:50:52,000
Hancock. I saw a few Hancocks asleep on a bench.

973
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:53,000
Hancock's gotta be...

974
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:54,000
Los Angeles.

975
00:50:54,000 --> 00:51:04,600
I was like, "Oh, Hollywood's crazy. They have all these Hancock impersonators."

976
00:51:04,600 --> 00:51:07,600
They're filming a Hancock sequel, yeah.

977
00:51:07,600 --> 00:51:10,600
Taking a picture with a homeless guy.

978
00:51:10,600 --> 00:51:12,600
Yo, just met Hancock on the street.

979
00:51:12,600 --> 00:51:14,860
(laughing)

980
00:51:14,860 --> 00:51:18,440
- It's like a bunch of pictures of you on the Walk of Fame

981
00:51:18,440 --> 00:51:20,920
where it's pictures of you with Spider-Man and Batman

982
00:51:20,920 --> 00:51:22,520
and just a homeless guy like,

983
00:51:22,520 --> 00:51:26,160
all my favorite superheroes, Batman, Spider-Man, and Hancock.

984
00:51:26,160 --> 00:51:27,280
(laughing)

985
00:51:27,280 --> 00:51:28,480
- Hancock was swag, though.

986
00:51:28,480 --> 00:51:30,680
- Dude, Hancock was so strong, he beat the shit out of me.

987
00:51:30,680 --> 00:51:33,320
- He honestly might be the most powerful superhero ever.

988
00:51:33,320 --> 00:51:34,160
(laughing)

989
00:51:34,160 --> 00:51:36,000
He honestly might be.

990
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:38,720
Yeah, and he was on fucking drugs and alcohol.

991
00:51:38,720 --> 00:51:39,880
- He was a god, though.

992
00:51:39,880 --> 00:51:41,600
He's not even a superhero, he's just a god.

993
00:51:41,600 --> 00:51:45,120
he was a god was it is what the movie is a little more of the movie but it was an

994
00:51:45,120 --> 00:51:45,680

they figure in the hancock will not seen hancock i think i will not have a

1005
00:52:05,600 --> 00:52:08,480
fair i don't know i was allowed to watch and talk when it came out

1006
00:52:08,480 --> 00:52:11,080
i was because of the press name

1007
00:52:11,080 --> 00:52:13,400
hancock handcraft

1008
00:52:13,400 --> 00:52:17,360
is it based on a comic book urbans will smith's is a very long story it's

1009
00:52:17,360 --> 00:52:18,600
pretty bad

1010
00:52:18,600 --> 00:52:22,940
it's breaking that's been still again ok although it's breaking that from the

1011
00:52:22,940 --> 00:52:24,900
community breaks that i would have

1012
00:52:24,900 --> 00:52:28,980
number six george washington this list does not have a very clear through line

1013
00:52:28,980 --> 00:52:33,740
now the illuminati but i know what the truth towards washington never existed

1014
00:52:33,740 --> 00:52:36,740
the world israel the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the

1015
00:52:36,740 --> 00:52:40,740
first normal mention number seven is the JFK assassination. I believe this

1016
00:52:40,740 --> 00:52:41,460
didn't happen.

1017
00:52:41,460 --> 00:52:44,160
I agree as hell.

1018
00:52:44,160 --> 00:52:47,660
I'm agree as hell.

1019
00:52:47,660 --> 00:52:50,460
I'm agree as Hall actually.

1020
00:52:50,460 --> 00:52:51,960
I'm agree

1021
00:52:51,960 --> 00:52:58,460
I'm agree as Hall the worst written comment that you can't even read it.

1022
00:52:58,460 --> 00:53:03,660
You you try to read it correctly dude. I'm agree as Hall. He was opposed to

1023
00:53:03,660 --> 00:53:06,300
the federal reserve the Illuminati didn't like that.

1024
00:53:06,300 --> 00:53:10,300
That's some supporting evidence. The Illuminati is there to stop people from...

1025
00:53:10,300 --> 00:53:14,900
I think the problem with the JFK assassination is everyone needs to stop talking about it

1026
00:53:14,900 --> 00:53:18,740
for like ten years and then everything about it will be like funny again. But everyone

1027
00:53:18,740 --> 00:53:22,180
says it's too much. Everyone's doing it. All this funny stuff has been said. Everyone's

1028
00:53:22,180 --> 00:53:25,500
said it a hundred times. We just need to take a break, pretend it doesn't exist for ten

1029
00:53:25,500 --> 00:53:26,500
years.

1030
00:53:26,500 --> 00:53:27,500
We need another president to get assassinated.

1031
00:53:27,500 --> 00:53:28,500
That could work too.

1032
00:53:28,500 --> 00:53:31,180
Interesting that you find the death of a president to be funny.

1033
00:53:31,180 --> 00:53:32,620
that's what i'm saying stuff like that

1034
00:53:32,620 --> 00:53:35,260
it's not we need to take a break

1035
00:53:35,260 --> 00:53:38,340
a break and then i'm talking about how much funny stuff came out about it's

1036
00:53:38,340 --> 00:53:40,540
just scary

1037
00:53:40,540 --> 00:53:44,180
i mean i don't know what can you imagine if a president died in today's day and

1038
00:53:44,180 --> 00:53:46,700
age with all the phones would be so great

1039
00:53:46,700 --> 00:53:48,380
with all the phones

1040
00:53:48,380 --> 00:53:50,620
it would be so crazy

1041
00:53:50,620 --> 00:53:53,260
we'd have so many videos of it i mean that's why that's why they have that's

1042
00:53:53,260 --> 00:53:55,780
why another one hasn't been assassinated because everyone wants the phones

1043
00:53:55,780 --> 00:54:03,780
I am addicted to this thing dude.

1044
00:54:03,780 --> 00:54:04,780
I cannot get enough.

1045
00:54:04,780 --> 00:54:06,180
It's like a candy bar to me.

1046
00:54:06,180 --> 00:54:07,180
It is.

1047
00:54:07,180 --> 00:54:10,460
It's basically like a candy bar that I can look up pictures of other candy bars on.

1048
00:54:10,460 --> 00:54:11,460
Yeah.

1049
00:54:11,460 --> 00:54:12,460
I love putting stuff up on my phone.

1050
00:54:12,460 --> 00:54:13,460
Oh my god, that's a perfect candy bar.

1051
00:54:13,460 --> 00:54:18,140
You're waking up in the morning and just reaching over my night table and taking a few bites

1052
00:54:18,140 --> 00:54:20,580
of my candy bar before going to bed for an hour.

1053
00:54:20,580 --> 00:54:22,620
Wait, I don't know what this entry is.

1054
00:54:22,620 --> 00:54:24,060
Number nine is red scarf deaths.

1055
00:54:24,060 --> 00:54:25,060
I've never heard of that.

1056
00:54:25,060 --> 00:54:30,820
That's from, it's like people who got red scarf disease. I'm gonna Google that. Yeah, me too.

1057
00:54:30,820 --> 00:54:38,980
I don't fucking know. I knew it! I was just waiting for him to say. Facebook posts say

1058
00:54:38,980 --> 00:54:43,580
is Kate's PolitiFact says Kate Spade worked with the Clintons and suggests

1059
00:54:43,580 --> 00:54:47,920
they were involved in her death. Oh yeah, that's true. Kate Spade killed herself. No, she was

1060
00:54:47,920 --> 00:54:51,540
killed by Hillary. She was killed by David. Because she was killed by Hillary

1061
00:54:51,540 --> 00:54:55,500
because her brother-in-law David Spade was too funny and he was about to do the

1062
00:54:55,500 --> 00:55:00,980
funniest impression of Hillary on SNL. What's his show called at night?

1063
00:55:00,980 --> 00:55:05,180
Like Buzz Off with David Spade that was his late-night show or something?

1064
00:55:05,180 --> 00:55:08,700
That's where all of his guests ride the Sibian. Yeah that's a good show.

1065
00:55:08,700 --> 00:55:14,660
Yeah. Oh you know who they had on that show before she passed? Ruth Bader Ginsburg.

1066
00:55:14,660 --> 00:55:20,660
Really? I saw that episode. Lights Out. She busts a fat nut.

1067
00:55:20,660 --> 00:55:25,660
bader Ginsburg basically first no-hand squirt

1068
00:55:25,660 --> 00:55:33,660
squirt bader squirt Berg squirt bader squirt Burke I wish she was still alive

1069
00:55:33,660 --> 00:55:38,500
which which justice of the of the the highest court in the land would you like

1070
00:55:38,500 --> 00:55:41,940
to see squirt the most Sonya Sotomayor I think so to my or might be my number one

1071
00:55:41,940 --> 00:55:46,020
I need to see I need to see RBG on the cover of a magazine under my mattress

1072
00:55:46,020 --> 00:55:50,220
Thomas wouldn't squirt for anything I could make him you could not make how

1073
00:55:50,220 --> 00:55:53,580
How would you make, alright I'd like to see you try, how would you make Clarence Thomas

1074
00:55:53,580 --> 00:55:54,580
squirt?

1075
00:55:54,580 --> 00:55:55,580
Shirk him off!

1076
00:55:55,580 --> 00:55:57,620
First I take him out to dinner, I feed him a bunch of Oreos.

1077
00:55:57,620 --> 00:55:58,620
No.

1078
00:55:58,620 --> 00:55:59,620
He just comes everywhere.

1079
00:55:59,620 --> 00:56:02,620
Oreos are filled with white cream.

1080
00:56:02,620 --> 00:56:03,620
That's a good point.

1081
00:56:03,620 --> 00:56:10,540
You don't have to build up white cream in the body and squirt it out.

1082
00:56:10,540 --> 00:56:14,140
The Oreo cookie makes black poop, the white cream makes white cream.

1083
00:56:14,140 --> 00:56:15,140
That sounds true.

1084
00:56:15,140 --> 00:56:16,980
It's like a bird.

1085
00:56:16,980 --> 00:56:17,980
That's because it is true.

1086
00:56:17,980 --> 00:56:19,580
Yeah, it's like a bird.

1087
00:56:19,580 --> 00:56:23,680
and when you put, especially when you put Oreos in Clarence Thomas, he has a

1088
00:56:23,680 --> 00:56:26,120
yeah. He has a medical thing to that's the other thing. We didn't he's got

1089
00:56:26,120 --> 00:56:31,080
he's got Oreo spleen. He's got Oreo squirt disease and the Oreo squirt

1090
00:56:31,080 --> 00:56:34,680
comes out of it. He goes to the doctor. He's like doctor every time I eat

1091
00:56:34,680 --> 00:56:38,080
Oreos. I squirt everywhere and they're like oh, I would never we've never seen

1092
00:56:38,080 --> 00:56:42,180
this before. Can we call it the Clarence Thomas disease? No, call it the

1093
00:56:42,200 --> 00:56:45,360
- For your squirt disease, please.

1094
00:56:45,360 --> 00:56:48,320
- Yeah, so that's how I would do it.

1095
00:56:48,320 --> 00:56:49,160
- Pretty easy.

1096
00:56:49,160 --> 00:56:51,440
- With my hands and his prostate.

1097
00:56:51,440 --> 00:56:53,540
- I don't think you can make him squirt.

1098
00:56:53,540 --> 00:56:54,380
I just don't see it.

1099
00:56:54,380 --> 00:56:58,280
- I would make Clarence Thomas squirt prostate nut.

1100
00:56:58,280 --> 00:57:01,780
- I would personally abstain from doing it.

1101
00:57:01,780 --> 00:57:02,620
- Court.

1102
00:57:02,620 --> 00:57:03,440
- Court.

1103
00:57:03,440 --> 00:57:05,120
- That's a trick for the smart guys.

1104
00:57:05,120 --> 00:57:06,320
- Yeah, the thinkers.

1105
00:57:06,320 --> 00:57:07,160
- Oh yay, oh yay.

1106
00:57:07,160 --> 00:57:10,280
- Number 10 MKUltra, boring, heard of it.

1107
00:57:10,280 --> 00:57:12,680
Number 11, Lady Gaga videos.

1108
00:57:12,680 --> 00:57:14,280
Slay queens.

1109
00:57:14,280 --> 00:57:17,480
Yeah, dude. There's Mad Demonic, the Lady Gaga videos.

1110
00:57:17,480 --> 00:57:18,080
Oh.

Yeah.

1112
00:57:18,480 --> 00:57:19,080
Yeah, dude.

1113
00:57:19,080 --> 00:57:19,680
And what does she do?

1114
00:57:19,680 --> 00:57:21,280
She turns herself into ground beef.

1115
00:57:21,280 --> 00:57:21,880
Yeah.

1116
00:57:21,880 --> 00:57:23,280

Yeah.

1118
00:57:24,680 --> 00:57:26,680
She talks with Beyonce.

And she dresses up like a man at the VMAs and sings...

1120
00:57:29,680 --> 00:57:31,280
Oh, we're talking Lady Gaga?

1121
00:57:31,280 --> 00:57:33,880
Yeah, why are you hiding your eyes with those big-ass glasses, bitch?

1122
00:57:33,880 --> 00:57:35,680
Is it maybe because they are cat eyes?

1123
00:57:35,680 --> 00:57:37,080
Oh, is that your poker face?

1124
00:57:37,080 --> 00:57:40,080
