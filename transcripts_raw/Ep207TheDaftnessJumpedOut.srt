1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,080
come back and make a bet

2
00:00:01,080 --> 00:00:08,080

7
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:17,840

8
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:20,440
you are great at coming right out the gate of coming up with something

9
00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:22,800
fucking hilarious to start the episode

10
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:27,600
you just know how to keep the energy up instantly it's like let's fucking go dude

11
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:32,640
I was gonna do my Muhammad Ali milk milk lemonade and then you did woo it's a wild one.

12
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:33,640
It was good.

13
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:34,640
No, it was funny though.

14
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:35,640
It's a song.

15
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:36,640
He's mad at me.

16
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:37,640
Stop defending him.

17
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:38,640
You are mad at him.

18
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:39,640
I am mad at him.

19
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:40,640
He was being so rude to me.

20
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:41,640
He just was mocking you.

21
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:42,640
It's not that big of a deal.

22
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:43,640
That's really rude.

23
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:44,640
Mocking is rude.

24
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:47,640
You're still in the copycatting is rude phase?

25
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:48,640
How is it fake?

26
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:55,160
I get one day, listen, I get one day of not seeing my friends for a while and being sad

27
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:56,160
I get one day.

28
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:59,520
I get one day to complain about my friends being rude to me.

29
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:00,520
I think that's fair.

30
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:01,520
No, you don't get that.

31
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:02,520
I think it's completely fair.

32
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:03,520
I think it's completely fair.

33
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:04,520
I need a one day.

34
00:01:04,520 --> 00:01:05,520
I did do it.

35
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:06,520
I left it at the door.

36
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:07,520
I complained about my friends.

37
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:09,160
It's not my fault that you were sick.

38
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:10,840
It's actually your fault that I was sick.

39
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:11,840
Yeah.

40
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:12,840
Yeah.

41
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:13,840
And I surprisingly didn't get it.

42
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:14,840
So you get to be rude to me.

43
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:15,840
Why would I ever be rude?

44
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:16,840
Why would I ever be rude to me?

45
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:17,840
Exactly.

46
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:18,840
Why would a friend be rude to a friend?

47
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:19,840
That's a good point.

48
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:20,840
That's a good question, right?

49
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:21,840
Yeah.

50
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:22,840
That's a damn good question.

51
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:23,840
I don't know.

52
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:28,280
You're the only one who dodged COVID, dude. Straight fucking neo backflip.

53
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:31,440
Probably because I think I might have had it and then we went on tour.

54
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:32,440
You think you gave it to the Northeasterners?

55
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:33,440
I think you probably gave it to the Northeasterners.

56
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:37,440
I was probably asymptomatic and then I gave it to every single fan.

57
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:38,440
Yeah.

58
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:42,680
Because I tested every day before we left and I kept coming up negative, but when I

59
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:45,160
stopped testing was when we were on tour.

60
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:49,920
So I only tested positive the day that I was asleep for like, like I was feeling sick for

61
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:53,700
like four days and then on the fifth day I just felt like I was only awake for like

62
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:57,660
an hour. I mean I stayed inside well there's two reasons I stayed inside

63
00:01:57,660 --> 00:02:01,980
because I found a stray cat yeah I was watching it mm-hmm and but also I was

64
00:02:01,980 --> 00:02:07,020
staying inside I caught up on a lot of shows I'm on season three of

65
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:10,740
Better Call Saul now. Holy shit you started on season zero like yeah you're at zero

66
00:02:10,740 --> 00:02:15,740
holy fuck that's crazy that's great yeah I had an interesting day. I watched 100

67
00:02:15,740 --> 00:02:19,180
movies yeah I watched I watched the kids stays in the picture

68
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:23,900
what's that is this this documentary it's narrated by that's a goose robert

69
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:37,540
Evans where they take the photo yes they cheese and die that's a spoiler actually

70
00:02:37,540 --> 00:02:42,060
they don't that's what it says at the end it's a documentary about Robert Evans

71
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:47,420
who was like the like he was like a head at Paramount or something. Yeah I know Robert

72
00:02:47,420 --> 00:02:50,980
Evans I'm reading the Chinatown book right. Yeah yeah so so it's his

73
00:02:50,980 --> 00:02:55,140
documentary and it's all narrated by him it's all just like like old archive

74
00:02:55,140 --> 00:02:59,220
footage it's really good check it out but there's a scene in it where he's

75
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:04,780
talking about. His mom was a hoe? No the first time where he gets he gets the

76
00:03:04,780 --> 00:03:09,420
script for Rosemary's Baby and he's like like I needed like I needed somebody to

77
00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:19,920
direct this and I met one of my best friends, Roman Polanski. He says something where he's like talking...

78
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:23,920
He gets Roman Polanski to come to his office to read Rosemary's Baby under the

79
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:29,040
guise of it being a skiing movie and he's like "the kid asks me is it about skiing

80
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:35,300
and I say listen Polak you read that script and if you don't like it I'll

81
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:39,980
take you skiing anywhere in the world. I did, I'm reading the book about how

82
00:03:39,980 --> 00:03:44,140
about like how Chinatown got made and in the introduction it was

83
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:49,660
it's about Jack Nicholson, Robert Evans, something Thorpe and

84
00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:55,620
Roman Polanski. Robert Evans, he is the most wives of anybody in the world.

85
00:03:55,620 --> 00:03:59,940
Yeah so it was like it was describing like their their little stories next to

86
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:03,580
each other was like you know Jack Nicholson was having this love affair

87
00:04:03,580 --> 00:04:09,700
with this actress and and Robert Evans was his love life was troubled as well

88
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:15,940
and Roman Polanski had his share of ups and downs. The Roman Polanski it's so

89
00:04:15,940 --> 00:04:20,340
funny that like Roman Polanski is the one the one thing that can undo like like

90
00:04:20,340 --> 00:04:26,140
ever everybody over I would say like 30 years old yeah and the industry loves

91
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:31,080
Roman Polanski and I mean but they will talk like for hours about how he did

92
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:35,160
nothing wrong yeah and they love him he's the best guy ever and it's all completely overblown

93
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:39,640
everybody fucking signed it that's the thing Sigourney Weaver i learned recently everybody

94
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:44,120
i was reading Sigourney Weaver's wikipedia page you could probably count on on one hand

95
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:49,400
i got a lot i got caught up on a lot Sigourney Weaver's wikipedia better call Saul

96
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:54,200
straight to the sexuality section so you get a chance literally everybody signed that that

97
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:58,680
petition or whatever yeah i probably could have been bullied in the in the 90s into signing that

98
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:01,320
You wouldn't have had to be bullied in the 90s. Yeah, I would have probably just

99
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:05,640
everybody would sign it. Yeah, everybody did. I'd be like, oh, okay. Yeah, Roman Polanski.

100
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:09,080
Oh, yeah, I think he made a movie. Oh, he made a great movie. Like, I'm sure everybody that

101
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:12,920
signed it probably didn't know at the time or something. No, people knew. No, yeah, no,

102
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:16,840
nobody cared. He was on the fucking land. He's still on the land, technically. It's true. No,

103
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:20,520
everybody just... It's not... You can't excuse it. There's no... It's not that they didn't know or

104
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:25,080
that... They just all love him. They love what he did. It's so funny. That guy did

105
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:32,280
crazy crazy life crazy insane life holocaust survivor charles manson charles

106
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:37,720
manson murders your wife you you make the greatest movies and then you rape a

107
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:42,600
child that's like a fucking that's like i think it's like the odds i mean that's a

108
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:45,080
roller coaster

109
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:50,040
i'll say i'd say it's mostly down i would say it's two downs

110
00:05:50,040 --> 00:06:02,680
Which one's an up? What are the ups? Three downs, one up. I mean it depends on how annoying his wife was. He was married to Sharon Tate too.

111
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:07,520
Yeah. That's a loss. Sharon's taint.

112
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:13,000
Sharon's taint. Eww. He was sharing her taint with every fucking... With every Tom, Dick and Harry in Hollywood.

113
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:18,920
Yeah. He's sharing his wife as a whore and his wife as free love. Dude, that movie is so fucking funny.

114
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:20,920
The Kid Stays in the Picture.

115
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:23,800
Because it's literally like he just like says like

116
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:31,120
It's just so funny. It's just a guy who was just addicted to coke in the 70s, and he was just like I'm addicted to the movies

117
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:36,960
Yeah, and they think they're addicted to the movies. No he's addicted to the to the fame. Yeah

118
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:40,120
He just like the way he talks about all the shit in them

119
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:44,000
Oh, oh, there's a there's a scene where he gets the script for Chinatown

120
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:50,120
and he's like and I pick up the script and just like its title it's completely

121
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:55,360
Chinese I don't understand a goddamn thing in this script but I know Thorpe is

122
00:06:55,360 --> 00:07:00,040
a good writer it's true it's a great movie I watched it on a plane for the

123
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:02,800
first time couple years ago and I was like good move I'd never seen a Roman

124
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:07,360
Polanski movie and I was like holy crap Roman Polanski this fucking guy

125
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:14,680

126
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:20,320

127
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:25,040
potion right I don't know I never I'm always in Chinatown I think you should

128
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:29,520

129
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:33,760
intro oh no way where he's in the Jamaican outfit yeah hmm

130
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:39,920
I actually don't think you directed that. I went to the gym this morning and I did not

131
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:44,800
see Roman Polanski, although he would stick out like a sore thumb at my gym. He is tiny.

132
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:50,560
Yeah, five foot three. I got big guys over at my gym. I was doing, there's an exercise

133
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:55,400
called a skull crusher, right? That's not an exercise that somebody pranked you. No,

134
00:07:55,400 --> 00:08:00,440
it's called a skull crusher. You hold a dumbbell on top of your, like you lay down like this,

135
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:07,760
One of the big guys at his gym was like, "Yeah, this is called the Skull Crusher, right?

136
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:10,960
I put your head between my thighs and I lift you up."

137
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:11,960
That's just my thighs.

138
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:14,640
Honestly, that would be a complete dream.

139
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:20,880
But I was doing it and I realized that with these shorts, my little morning penis nub

140
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:28,400
was just like, it looked like I had a fucking M&M right here.

141
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:32,000
was just catching the light so perfectly. I looked down, my nub was just so... it

142
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,440
looked like I had the smallest penis in the entire world. You must have. The

143
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:38,760
only time you ever talk about your penis is you talk about how small it is. It

144
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:42,320
gets really really small in the mornings. Yeah. Like really really small and so I

145
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:46,480
was just looking at it and I was like... I'm exercising. I'm like pushing up a

146
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:53,400
weight on top of my head like... Yeah. And then I had a hat on and my hat fell off.

147
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:58,520
So it's just a combination of me sitting there with the smallest penis ever and

148
00:08:58,520 --> 00:09:03,120
imagining like a hot girl watching me and then my hat falls off to reveal I'm

149
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:12,920
bald. I just started laughing so hard and I dropped the dumbbell and it hit me on the forehead.

150
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:21,960
And then I just left the gym. It was the last exercise I did. I couldn't stop laughing. I was laughing so hard like into my hoodie as I was

151
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:23,240
walk around the gym just like that.

152
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:24,080
(laughing)

153
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:26,960
Fucking, that's the stupidest looking thing

154
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:28,560
anyone's ever seen.

155
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:29,760
- Did you have headphones in?

156
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:30,600
- I had headphones in too.

157
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:31,440
- Okay, good.

158
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:32,260
- So I'm listening to like--

159
00:09:32,260 --> 00:09:35,920
- If you didn't have headphones, that happens.

160
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:38,880
Somebody's watching you, sees your tiny penis.

161
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:39,720
- Yeah, like oh this must be like a--

162
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:41,240
- It sees your half all over your ball,

163
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:44,200
then you just start laughing and walking around the gym,

164
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:45,600
and then you leave.

165
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:49,280
- This must be one of those like social experiment breaks.

166
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:50,840
- Listening to DMX.

167
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:51,680
- Yeah.

168
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:56,560
there, my penis is the size of an ant and it reveals that I'm bald. I should have

169
00:09:56,560 --> 00:10:00,720
farted. I should have dropped the weight on my stomach and farted like the

170
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:01,720
Pillsbury Doughboy.

171
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:03,720
Oh, and then do a somersault while farting.

172
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:08,560
Yeah. It was so funny. I don't know when I'll be able to exercise again because

173
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:12,200
every time I do it, I'm going to think of that moment and just how funny it was.

174
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:16,520
Yeah. Speaking of penises, the other day I was in bed.

175
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:20,720
Yeah. He gets into every story he needs to tell. Come on. Every story in his

176
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:22,760
- I'm speaking of penises, go ahead.

177
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:25,120
- My girlfriend was telling me to get up.

178
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:27,600
I was trying to sleep in, and then I started

179
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:30,480
pretending to have a temper tantrum in the bed.

180
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:31,960
Like you can see the blank.

181
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:33,680
You know when little kids have temper tantrums

182
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:35,040
and you're trying to wake 'em up?

183
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:35,880
I was trying to do that.

184
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:37,640
- He's always trying to wake little kids up, Drew.

185
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:39,200
- I was trying to do that. - Going to their bedrooms.

186
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:40,040
- I was trying to do that.

187
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:41,600
- And they always have temper tantrums.

188
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:43,440
(laughing)

189
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:45,200
They always say, "No, I don't wanna get out of my bed."

190
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:48,160
- No, like you do the thing where it's like,

191
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:50,640
like that, and you hit the sides of your leg.

192
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:51,840
Why are you describing-

193
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:52,960
You know that kid you do with-

194
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:54,960
The thing you do with kids where they go, "Ugh!"

195
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:55,460
No.

196
00:10:55,460 --> 00:10:57,440
When you're getting them out of bed.

197
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:58,240
Why are you trying to-

198
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:01,360
This is- This gets funny and you guys aren't even letting me fucking finish it.

199
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:02,240
You have a- You have your-

200
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:05,120
'Cause you have to get one thing in every single time.

201
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:08,400
You have your mommy brat, uh, sex relationship.

202
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:09,920
I understand. Go ahead.

203
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:15,360
I was doing that as a joke and then I- I fully punched myself in the nuts.

204
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:18,800
The hardest I've ever, ever hit myself in the nuts.

205
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:19,120
Ever?

206
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:20,000
Did you threw up?

207
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:24,440
I almost threw, I rolled out of bed and almost puked on the floor.

208
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:25,440
Damn.

209
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:28,640
I would love to accidentally hit myself in the nuts hard enough that I'd throw up someday.

210
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:32,880
See, now that would have been funnier if I didn't get interrupted by you guys trying

211
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:33,880
to call me a pedophile.

212
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:37,480
Us telling you a pedophile is way funnier than you just hitting yourself in the nuts

213
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:38,480
accidentally.

214
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:39,480
I don't think so.

215
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:41,680
It would be funny if you hit yourself in the nuts in front of us right now.

216
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:42,680
I'm not going to do that.

217
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:43,680
And I got to see it.

218
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:44,680
That would be funny.

219
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:45,680
And also that you didn't throw up.

220
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:50,360
My is it throw up my friend his brother got in a fight a couple weeks ago or some

221
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:55,400
shit and he like they like he just showed up that at his parents house the

222
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:58,440
next day with like two black eyes like what happened he's like oh I got in a

223
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:07,720
fight but it was fine. He just started projectile vomiting everywhere. I thought that was such a funny like like the you

224
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:12,760
projectile vomiting because of a concussion? Yeah, there's no hiding that.

225
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:16,360
yeah you get into a fight and you have first of all you have two black guys you

226
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:21,080
should cover it with makeup I'm just I'm just goth now yeah I just became goth

227
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:26,000
my older brother every time that he would go to parties or something cuz he you

228
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,800
just would like throw up when he would drink yeah but anytime that he threw up

229
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:34,120
when he would drink like the he would pop blood vessels under his eyes oh god

230
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:39,280
cuz he would puke so hard ah he'd come home from these parties after throwing

231
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:44,360
come and he'd be like I like I was not out doing anything last night I was not

232
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:48,820
doing a single thing and meanwhile he's got like just completely like like just

233
00:12:48,820 --> 00:12:54,480
red dots all under his eyes and he's pale white just from bruh seriously what

234
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:58,400
exorcist mode it sounds like you know I haven't been drinking I've been I did

235
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:03,640
last night I tried the Heineken zero that those when I was a like sober for

236
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:07,960
six months and I would drink those I would get like projectile diarrhea

237
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:09,960
Really? Because it's just wheat.

238
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:11,960
For me it just blends.

239
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:13,960
No alcohol in it. It blends right in. I mean I only had one.

240
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:15,960
It just blends right into my drink.

241
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:17,960
If you drink three of those

242
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:19,960
in one night. Why are you drinking three of them?

243
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:21,960
Because I have

244
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:23,960
There's no alcohol in them. I have an alcohol problem.

245
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:25,960
There's no, you're so sick of it.

246
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:27,960
And I'm trying to replace it with something. So you're doing binge

247
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:29,960
fake alcohol drinking? Yeah. I was just like

248
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:31,960
oh the taste of the beer sucks. Because I have a living

249
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:33,960
where I need to constantly be sipping something.

250
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:35,960
There was one, Kai sent me one of those. I get that.

251
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:39,160
I that with the seltzer you know those those fake reddit posts that people

252
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:43,260
always post there the am I the asshole ones I sent me one that was like

253
00:13:43,260 --> 00:13:46,360
there's no way this is real, but it was making me laugh so hard this guy who

254
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:50,780
he said he was a recovering alcoholic and he would so but he like so he would

255
00:13:50,780 --> 00:13:55,680
drink a bunch of non alcoholic beer like to replace it or whatever and he said

256
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:59,900
in the post that he would he would drink it in the morning at work.

257
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:07,920
I guess you technically can do that.

258
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:09,420
And then people were like, yeah, and he was like,

259
00:14:09,420 --> 00:14:10,920
"My coworkers are getting mad at me.

260
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:12,220
"They're always making fun of me."

261
00:14:12,220 --> 00:14:13,140
And people were like,

262
00:14:13,140 --> 00:14:15,300
"Well, you technically can do that, but you shouldn't."

263
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:17,300
And he's like, "Yeah, and I'm shotgunning."

264
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:19,560
(laughing)

265
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:22,900
- Shotgunning a non-alcoholic beer?

266
00:14:22,900 --> 00:14:24,540
- It's so fucking funny, dude.

267
00:14:24,540 --> 00:14:26,580
- It does taste like beer, to give it, you know.

268
00:14:26,580 --> 00:14:29,980
- Heineken Zero, though, tastes like, no, no, no.

269
00:14:29,980 --> 00:14:31,500
- I mean, Heineken tastes like shit anyway.

270
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:33,580
- Yeah, but Beck's non-alcoholic.

271
00:14:33,580 --> 00:14:35,780
I've never had Beck's beer.

272
00:14:35,780 --> 00:14:36,780
- I don't think they drink it normally.

273
00:14:36,780 --> 00:14:37,620
- No, they do.

274
00:14:37,620 --> 00:14:38,440
- Do they?

275
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:41,840
- I went through every single non-alcoholic beer

276
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:46,840
when I was like, I'm gonna be completely sober at 23

277
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:48,540
and I will never fall off the wagon again.

278
00:14:48,540 --> 00:14:50,040
- You try the IPNA?

279
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:52,040
- Yeah, I would get IPNAs and then there was

280
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:53,380
a Hoppy Refresher.

281
00:14:53,380 --> 00:14:55,340
Hoppy Refresher's good, it's just a seltzer.

282
00:14:55,340 --> 00:14:56,460
- What's that, a frog drink?

283
00:14:56,460 --> 00:14:57,300
- It's a seltzer, yep.

284
00:14:57,300 --> 00:14:58,580
- Come on, pound that out real quick.

285
00:14:58,580 --> 00:15:00,680
- I'm gonna pound that one.

286
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:01,520
- Gotta respect that.

287
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:02,340
- Hoppy Refresher is just--

288
00:15:02,340 --> 00:15:03,840
- Respect that work that you went into that one.

289
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:04,840
That was a classic.

290
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:08,080
It's just a seltzer water that they put like hops in it or something.

291
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:09,080
Yeah.

292
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:10,240
And it's pretty good.

293
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:13,200
But IPNA gave me diarrhea.

294
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:15,400
Beck's non-alcoholic tastes like raisins.

295
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:17,200
It tastes like if you liquefied a raisin.

296
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:20,360
Can you imagine how much of a bitch you'd think your dad was if you walked in and he

297
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:21,720
was drinking a hoppy refresher?

298
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:22,720
Right?

299
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:23,720
While he's watching football?

300
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:24,720
Yeah.

301
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:25,720
Fuck you, dad.

302
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:29,200
I guess you, I guess there's a lot of context for seeing, I feel like if you see your dad

303
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:33,240
drinking a hoppy refresher, there's a lot of context, there's a lot of prior stuff that

304
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:34,240
probably happened.

305
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:36,240
- What a pussy, dude.

306
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:37,560
What if you walk into a bar--

307
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:38,680
- Out of all the options.

308
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:40,320
- You're like, oh, dad, what kind of whiskey do you drink?

309
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:42,520
He's like, I just put dye in some water.

310
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:44,120
- Yeah, soda and bitters.

311
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:46,080
- Yeah, no, it's not even soda and bitters, it's just water.

312
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:46,920
- I was doing that at the bars, too.

313
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:47,740
- Soda and bitters.

314
00:15:47,740 --> 00:15:48,580
- We would go to bars.

315
00:15:48,580 --> 00:15:50,240
There was like six months where I,

316
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:52,880
like when I moved to New York, I was completely sober.

317
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:53,720
- Yeah.

318
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:56,480
- And I did not know what to do with my time.

319
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:58,640
- You just try to learn how to do a back flip.

320
00:15:58,640 --> 00:16:00,760
- I did shit like that all the time.

321
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:02,280
- Yeah, that's how I've been feeling

322
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:08,980
last couple weeks. I felt I mean I know it's good zero, but zero tastes exactly

323
00:16:08,980 --> 00:16:12,060
like Budweiser. If you drink Buds you guys tell you this much you got zero buds.

324
00:16:12,060 --> 00:16:16,420
Nobody wants to hang around with your farting ass. You probably drove them all

325
00:16:16,420 --> 00:16:20,340
away with your alcohol. You know what the best sober beer is?

326
00:16:20,340 --> 00:16:26,220
Water. Nice. Two liters of water per day. That actually doesn't

327
00:16:26,220 --> 00:16:29,280
taste anything like beer though. Yeah but it's actually delicious in its own way.

328
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:36,360
Yeah, you're sober like a gopher huh? Yeah, it's actually delicious in its own way water. You were straight edge for a bit. Yeah

329
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:39,760
I still I forgot about still completely straight edge

330
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:47,660
I'm gonna claim straight edge if any hardcore fans are listening to this or it would take it seriously come and kill me

I'm gonna claim the edge till I die and I'm gonna drink every night straight edge people

333
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:58,240
Dude, straight edge people are the biggest fucking wimp losers in the world.

334
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:01,840
Yeah, no, trying to make not drinking tough is so funny.

335
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:06,640
Yeah, it's like, I know that you are not as tough as a drunk guy because you have inhibitions.

336
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:07,640
Yeah.

337
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:08,640
You have like...

338
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:11,560
There's... you were proud of yourself.

339
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:13,120
Yeah, like you have some... yeah.

340
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:14,120
You have...

341
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:15,120
You have shame.

342
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:16,120
There's no...

343
00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:17,120
A drunk guy has shame.

344
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:18,120
A drunk guy has shame.

345
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:19,120
Yeah, there's nothing that this guy won't do.

346
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:20,760
Drunk guys will bite you in a fight.

347
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:21,920
Drunk guys will fucking like...

348
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:22,920
Yeah, they'll...

349
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:23,920
I mean...

350
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:28,240
hit you with a car. A drunk guy, he's a danger, he can make anything a weapon.

351
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:32,880
He's a danger to himself and society. Exactly. You might be just a danger to society, this

352
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:36,760
guy might actually kill himself trying to kill you. That's the worst part about straight

353
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:42,760
edge people is because they're a danger to only society. And they're so good to themselves.

354
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:49,440
Exactly. They're treating their body like an actual temple. And they're protecting themselves,

355
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:54,400
playing balloons tower defense with the world. Straight edge people are exactly like Travis

356
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:58,560
Bickle and Taxi Driver. It's the same level of derangement where you're training your body

357
00:17:58,560 --> 00:18:03,520
like like okay Travis Bickle what you're training your body to get to for your wrist to get burned

358
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:08,480
by the stove what situation you're going to need that in. Yeah what touching a hot doorknob. Yeah

359
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:12,160
like it's never going to happen. Yeah what are you trying to be? Sticky bandits? You're gonna

360
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:17,120
have to walk a straight line someday. It's not gonna matter. That's just the truth. Yeah.

361
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:22,640
if you're running away from a crocodile you want to run zigzag not straight line

362
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:25,520
a drunk person has the edge on you there that's right you're walking wobbling

363
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:28,880
one foot in front of the other walking all the way down yeah get eaten I will

364
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:35,120
say those those straight edge guys do do make the best music to to get drunk -

365
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:40,120
uh-huh they do they make the best music that is not true no that's not true no

366
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:47,120
it's not true pirates do that's true pirates make the best music.

367
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:51,120
I think it's like cool.

368
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:55,280
I think that straight edge guys make the best music to take and add a roll and get all of

369
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:56,480
your chores done too.

370
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:59,840
I think all of these are not wrong dude it's all like cool black guys.

371
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:02,040
I think everybody makes awesome music.

372
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:05,160
But I'm saying in I'm putting like cool moving the goalposts.

373
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:09,360
Cool black guys make the best music for every all the best music is made by cool black guys.

374

379
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:38,640

380
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:43,440
hand it's cool and there's one line so first I think the first line of the

381
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:48,240
first song in that album is like I'm as straight as that line that you start up

382

And I heard, and this is not what I want to say.

477
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:28,000
not what I want to repeat. I heard if you are a New York resident, I heard this

478
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:32,400
from Eric Adams. If you don't go to the show, you will be placed on the sex

479
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:37,520
offender registry. I heard this from Eric Andre. He said ranch ranch it up.

480
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:43,800
I actually heard that from him personally. He told me to ranch it up.

481
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:49,080
I heard and I heard that real from Eric Adams to an Eric Adams as well. I heard

482
00:25:49,100 --> 00:25:54,500
huge fan of Adult Swim. Eric Adams loves alternative comedy. He's an Adult Swim diehard superfan.

483
00:25:54,500 --> 00:25:59,060
And that's why he says if you don't go to the show you'll be placed on, your house will

484
00:25:59,060 --> 00:26:03,040
be put on family watchdog. I heard that Eric Adams about this Halloween show said awesome

485
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:08,700
show great job. Tim and Eric Adams. That's right. Now that Eric Wareheim's got a food

486
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:12,340
addiction, they gotta get a second Eric on there. He's addicted to pizza and wine. Yeah

487
00:26:12,340 --> 00:26:18,580
so now they got to get a different guy to rehab because you're addicted to pizza

488
00:26:18,580 --> 00:26:24,180
and wine. You show up to alcoholics anonymous to be like yeah, i've been

489
00:26:24,180 --> 00:26:27,620
drinking too much wine and also eating way too much pizza with me.

490
00:26:27,620 --> 00:26:34,020
Who with me i've had a big problem with wine, but it's mostly pizza yeah yeah.

491
00:26:34,020 --> 00:26:39,460
I mean you know and chicken sashimi. I drank two bottles of wine last night and

492
00:26:39,460 --> 00:26:44,340
and I went over to my pizza and I just kind of experimented with new different

493
00:26:44,340 --> 00:26:46,140
types of semolina.

494
00:26:46,140 --> 00:26:48,360
And I went outside to my brick pizza oven.

495
00:26:48,360 --> 00:26:50,320
It cost me $6,000.

496
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:51,320
I'm completely addicted.

497
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:53,140
I'm addicted to this pizza thing.

498
00:26:53,140 --> 00:26:54,820
I've been thinking about getting a pizza oven.

499
00:26:54,820 --> 00:26:55,820
It'd be cool.

500
00:26:55,820 --> 00:26:56,820
In your apartment?

501
00:26:56,820 --> 00:26:58,940

502
00:26:58,940 --> 00:26:59,940
Just put a -- yeah.

503
00:26:59,940 --> 00:27:00,940
Yeah, you don't need a bedroom.

504
00:27:00,940 --> 00:27:02,380
You just sleep in the living room.

505
00:27:02,380 --> 00:27:04,980
Listen, I'm on the penthouse top floor, third floor suite.

506
00:27:04,980 --> 00:27:07,620
I think like two or three months ago,

507
00:27:07,620 --> 00:27:09,660
our friend, you made fun of our friend Bob

508
00:27:09,660 --> 00:27:11,660
for having a pizza oven.

509
00:27:11,660 --> 00:27:14,380
- I just wanna point out, you're a fucking tattletale cop.

510
00:27:14,380 --> 00:27:15,740
You know that, you realize that?

511
00:27:15,740 --> 00:27:17,460
You're such a baby for remembering things like that.

512
00:27:17,460 --> 00:27:20,140
- You made fun of our friend for having a pizza oven,

513
00:27:20,140 --> 00:27:21,580

Is that how dense you are?

517
00:27:25,540 --> 00:27:26,860
- I think you actually do.

518
00:27:26,860 --> 00:27:28,420
- I do, I wish I could.

519
00:27:28,420 --> 00:27:30,660
- And he admit, oh my God, he admit it.

520
00:27:30,660 --> 00:27:32,980

00:27:34,300 --> 00:27:36,700
And guess what he also, he gets to play golf all the time.

You think I get to play golf all the time?

524
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:39,340
- I hate him so much.

525
00:27:39,340 --> 00:27:40,160
- I live like a slave.

526
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:41,220
- He has the best life.

527
00:27:41,220 --> 00:27:42,060
- I have the worst life fucking ever.

528
00:27:42,060 --> 00:27:44,220
- We have the worst lives and this man

529
00:27:44,220 --> 00:27:46,420
has a beautiful pizza oven.

530
00:27:46,420 --> 00:27:47,580
- I'm a fucking henchman.

531
00:27:47,580 --> 00:27:49,300
- He can be addicted to pizza.

532
00:27:49,300 --> 00:27:51,500
- We're the bottom bitch of New York podcasts.

00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:52,740
We just walk around and get our asses fucked.

00:27:59,660 --> 00:28:01,660
'cause we tell all the truth.

539
00:28:01,660 --> 00:28:03,740

00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:34,840
seven I know it's eight it's the one that neither of those are true

547
00:28:34,840 --> 00:28:42,160
the show is at midnight I think it was 730 doors 630 but let me double see you

548
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:45,280
can do that then you still got time for trick-or-treating yeah yeah and guess

549
00:28:45,280 --> 00:28:48,200
what Halloween this year it's on a Monday night so your Halloween parties

550
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:54,280
they're gonna be on the weekend before that Halloween party after the show no

551
00:28:54,280 --> 00:29:01,080
at Patrick's apartment and in a in an undisclosed at a location. Yeah, it's 730 show, 630 doors. It's

552
00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:04,840
nice. It's nice and early. Oh yeah, you'd be out of there by the whatever 10 o'clock.

553
00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:05,400
By 8 o'clock.

554
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:11,640
Yeah, 745. You're back on the streets knocking on doors.

555
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:16,200
All right, dude, we should do some trick-or-treating this year. Oh my god, I would love to.

556
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:21,080
And our costumes. You know what? My costume came in the mail and I sent you guys a picture of it.

557
00:29:21,080 --> 00:29:25,480
What do you guys think pretty fire I've done I've been trick-or-treating near

558
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:29,800
nary 40 times right and I've never once

559
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:35,720
well how you manage that what do you mean you go around you go around twice

560
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:38,680
that doesn't count as if you go around twice it doesn't count as two separate

561
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:42,280
I've got in different that's one that doesn't count that's one I hit the

562
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:45,560
north side shout out north side then I hit the west side shadow well that's all

563
00:29:45,560 --> 00:29:48,840
one side shout out to that's all one then I hit the dirty south so that's all

564
00:29:48,840 --> 00:29:52,840
one trick-or-treating. What if I take a nap between them? That's still one trick-or-treating.

565
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:56,840
What if I'm on the Uber-Mitch sleep cycle so that isn't even a nap.

566
00:29:56,840 --> 00:30:00,840
That counts as my sleep. Trick-or-treating happens for all of Halloween.

567
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:04,840
That's a Halloween day the entire day. But what if I be doing that before Halloween?

568
00:30:04,840 --> 00:30:08,840
If you do it on different days, that counts. So that's what I do. Okay, so you completely changed.

569
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:12,840
No, I just remembered. Trick-or-treating is whenever and wherever

570
00:30:12,840 --> 00:30:16,840
you get candy on Halloween. And I be doing the trunk-or-treat as well. What's the trunk-or-treat?

571
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:21,140
retreat never did trunk retreat at church. No, where you go and you and it's

572
00:30:21,140 --> 00:30:24,140
trick or treat, but you don't get to wear any scary costumes because the devil

573
00:30:24,140 --> 00:30:28,440
likes that and it's all people dressed up like Power Rangers and there's a cake

574
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:32,340
walk and you Bob for apples. What is a cake walk? That's where you walk around

575
00:30:32,340 --> 00:30:34,340
in a circle and wherever you stop you want a cake.

576
00:30:34,340 --> 00:30:39,240
It's like basically musical chairs, but yeah, with cakes with cakes. Yeah,

577
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:45,340

578
00:30:45,340 --> 00:30:47,600
(laughter)

579
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:49,100
- What the fuck are you talking about?

580
00:30:49,100 --> 00:30:49,940
- I had a parent-teacher night.

581
00:30:49,940 --> 00:30:51,380
- It's so long!

582
00:30:51,380 --> 00:30:53,420
- What the fuck is a cakewalk?

583
00:30:53,420 --> 00:30:54,780
Oh yeah, we had that with the ham.

584
00:30:54,780 --> 00:30:55,620
- Yeah, my seventh grade.

585
00:30:55,620 --> 00:30:56,440
- You had a ham walk?

586
00:30:56,440 --> 00:30:57,940
- Oh yeah, it's like a ham walk.

587
00:30:57,940 --> 00:30:58,780
- What the hell are you on about?

588
00:30:58,780 --> 00:31:02,020
- My seventh grade, they had like the parent-teacher night

589
00:31:02,020 --> 00:31:04,220
where it's like the kids and the parents show up

590
00:31:04,220 --> 00:31:06,580
and it's like, "We're doing like a meeting."

591
00:31:06,580 --> 00:31:08,620
And they gave out a ham.

592
00:31:08,620 --> 00:31:10,300
- Are you bloody mental?

593
00:31:10,300 --> 00:31:11,140
Are you daft?

594
00:31:11,140 --> 00:31:11,980
- What the?

595
00:31:11,980 --> 00:31:12,820
(laughter)

596
00:31:12,820 --> 00:31:13,660
- This is Mrs. Vessels and--

597
00:31:13,660 --> 00:31:15,660
What the bollocks are you on about?

598
00:31:15,660 --> 00:31:17,660
What the hell is that?

599
00:31:17,660 --> 00:31:19,660
They gave a ham out?

600
00:31:19,660 --> 00:31:21,660
That's the most insane shit I've ever heard.

601
00:31:21,660 --> 00:31:23,660
That's crazy. Ham.

602
00:31:23,660 --> 00:31:25,660
Like a big honey baked ham.

603
00:31:25,660 --> 00:31:27,660
In a bag.

604
00:31:27,660 --> 00:31:29,660
Like the ham from the store.

605
00:31:29,660 --> 00:31:31,660
For like $11. And then my aunt won it.

606
00:31:31,660 --> 00:31:33,660
And then my aunt Maureen cooked the ham.

607
00:31:33,660 --> 00:31:35,660
Like a spiral ham.

608
00:31:35,660 --> 00:31:37,660
Yeah, my aunt Maureen had ham for dinner that night.

609
00:31:37,660 --> 00:31:39,660
That's crazy. I might be conflating

610
00:31:39,660 --> 00:31:41,660
two things.

611
00:31:41,660 --> 00:31:51,380
I might be conflating no cuz I think she she definitely won a ham from my seventh

612
00:31:51,380 --> 00:31:56,460
grade teacher was it refrigerated was it just sitting in the it was it was a

613
00:31:56,460 --> 00:32:00,440
raffle that goes on for like a month where you find a ham is like at the

614
00:32:00,440 --> 00:32:05,860
front of the class I had to ask her well I know that my aunt Maureen wanted

615
00:32:05,860 --> 00:32:09,420
smoked I guess you should be able to that should they should be like a reward

616
00:32:09,420 --> 00:32:11,760
We could go to the grocery store on the corner.

617
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:14,100
We could do a ham walk at the live show.

618
00:32:14,100 --> 00:32:16,260
Did you just say we could buy a ham?

619
00:32:16,260 --> 00:32:17,260
Of course we can buy a ham.

620
00:32:17,260 --> 00:32:19,660
Yeah, we could go buy a spiral ham right now.

621
00:32:19,660 --> 00:32:21,500
You say they have them at the grocery store?

622
00:32:21,500 --> 00:32:22,500
We can buy one?

623
00:32:22,500 --> 00:32:23,500
They have them at the grocery store.

624
00:32:23,500 --> 00:32:24,500
You are fucking...

625
00:32:24,500 --> 00:32:25,500
We could go buy one.

626
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:26,500
Something's wrong with you.

627
00:32:26,500 --> 00:32:28,260
Of course you can buy a ham at the grocery store.

628
00:32:28,260 --> 00:32:31,300
No, I'm just saying we could do it right now.

629
00:32:31,300 --> 00:32:32,300
No, we can't.

630
00:32:32,300 --> 00:32:33,300
We're recording the podcast.

631
00:32:33,300 --> 00:32:34,980
We could pause and then go get a ham.

632
00:32:34,980 --> 00:32:35,980
And do what?

633
00:32:35,980 --> 00:32:36,980
I don't like it.

634
00:32:36,980 --> 00:32:40,400
not the same as pausing and going to get beers because there's no distinctive

635
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:44,720
opening click sound that you can do with the ham. We could we could we also have

636
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:49,840
an oven. We'd have to eat it cold. We'd have to put the glaze on and eat it

637
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:53,840
completely cold. That'd be disgusting. It'd be good. It's like icing at that

638
00:32:53,840 --> 00:33:00,080
point, the glaze. I talked about the chocolate ham, right? Yeah. Same cousin,

639
00:33:00,100 --> 00:33:05,100
same mom, same cousin, same mom, same cousin, same mom.

640
00:33:05,100 --> 00:33:10,860
When he was like four or five,

641
00:33:10,860 --> 00:33:13,140
he was obsessed with Scooby-Doo.

642
00:33:13,140 --> 00:33:14,640
And I've talked about this.

643
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:16,060
He was obsessed with Scooby-Doo

644
00:33:16,060 --> 00:33:19,240
and he saw Scooby-Doo put chocolate syrup on ham

645
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:21,300
and said, "Mom, for dinner, I want,

646
00:33:21,300 --> 00:33:23,620
"my birthday dinner, I want chocolate ham."

647
00:33:23,620 --> 00:33:25,500
We all had to eat a chocolate ham.

648
00:33:25,500 --> 00:33:26,820
- You all had to?

649
00:33:26,820 --> 00:33:27,660
There was no option?

650
00:33:27,660 --> 00:33:28,700
It wasn't a condiment?

651
00:33:28,700 --> 00:33:33,900
there was an inox regular pisa you know option but the each other there was only

652
00:33:33,900 --> 00:33:36,300
that are cake did they get that

653
00:33:36,300 --> 00:33:39,500
knows i need to know if i have a more cake

654
00:33:39,500 --> 00:33:40,780

00:33:40,780 --> 00:33:45,480

656
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:49,020

657
00:33:49,020 --> 00:33:52,820
this no option you had to talk with him you didn't even need it because my mom

658
00:33:52,820 --> 00:33:53,740
about that

659
00:33:53,740 --> 00:33:55,280
on my daughter's

660
00:33:55,280 --> 00:33:58,920
My mom probably is listening and will text me about the chocolate ham.

661
00:33:58,920 --> 00:34:05,360
I would say you were one of the fucking all ham all-stars.

662
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:08,120
I didn't eat that much ham growing up.

663
00:34:08,120 --> 00:34:09,120
All ham team.

664
00:34:09,120 --> 00:34:10,360
My dad never made spiral ham.

665
00:34:10,360 --> 00:34:12,520
I've never heard more ham stories in five minutes.

666
00:34:12,520 --> 00:34:13,520
My dad's a turkey guy.

667
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:14,520
Yeah, everybody likes...

668
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:17,620
My dad can cook the hell out of a turkey.

669
00:34:17,620 --> 00:34:20,000
Ham is the worst part of the Thanksgiving dinner.

670
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,000
It's even worse than the turkey.

671
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:26,340
Well see if you grow up with it yes, but if you didn't grow up with it it becomes a delicacy

672
00:34:26,340 --> 00:34:30,840
The spiral ham is a delicacy

673
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:35,660
Boy that's true if you didn't that's not true about like everything

674
00:34:35,660 --> 00:34:41,800
Ham is a spiral ham is a delicacy

675
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:44,520
In America ham is a delicacy

676
00:34:44,520 --> 00:34:46,520
He just drooled all over himself

677
00:34:47,080 --> 00:34:52,200
You fucking just spit drool everywhere. He's so he's just thinking about

678
00:34:52,200 --> 00:34:56,200
So wet and watering

679
00:34:56,200 --> 00:34:59,080
You know, I'm learning, you know, how I like

680
00:34:59,080 --> 00:35:06,800
In like Japan they'll eat like they eat like shark fins or whatever and they also eat fried chicken

681
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:11,780
It's like well, they're always and it's people are always like, you know in Japan like that's like a delicacy

682
00:35:11,780 --> 00:35:16,080
No, I say it's a delicacy. Do you think in like Japan? They're like, oh in America they eat ham

683
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:21,200
It's a delicacy to them probably love they love ham. They probably are in America

684
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:24,120
Peanut-butter-jelly sandwiches a delicacy

685
00:35:24,120 --> 00:35:36,020
That's literally what happened with KFC dude, I had a real I was like reading about this this weird KFC in Japan is like

686
00:35:36,020 --> 00:35:41,420
It's like oh, it's a delicacy. Yeah, you only eat it once a year you eat it and you eat it on Christmas

687
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:49,920
You eat it on Christmas and they sold it the guy who I heard it at in in Los Angeles popcorn is a delicacy

688
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:58,180
Corn is more commonplace in Los Angeles. It's just like the side

689
00:36:07,160 --> 00:36:13,880
nothing. I heard that in the Sahara Desert, water is actually a delicacy to a lot of people

690
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:19,960
there. People just sell popcorn on the street in Hollywood, California. Literally, it's

691
00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:24,800
like everyone I know who grew up in Hollywood says something about like, "Oh yeah, we used

692
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:30,600
to eat like ribs with popcorn." Like the East Coast popcorn is just not as good. You got

693
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:34,040
to go to the West Coast to get the popcorn straight from Hollywood. Something about the

694
00:36:34,040 --> 00:36:37,420
butter that the popcorn tray from Hollywood the water there is different

695
00:36:37,420 --> 00:36:51,080
and it's I don't know why it affects the corn but it's just it's better like

696
00:36:51,080 --> 00:36:58,280
like like like like anthropologist who's like studying culture being like yeah I

697
00:36:58,280 --> 00:37:02,520
want some hot some Hollywood we should get some we should get some popcorn yeah

698
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:07,680
Hollywood style popcorn. Speaking of Hollywood and movies we actually do have a list. I just want to give you my popcorn secret.

699
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:14,400
Let's hear it really quick. If you take you take a kettle corn and you put the

700
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:20,400
garam masala in it it's pretty good. I put I put spray deodorant on mine. Yeah?

701
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:27,600
Yeah. Axe chocolate. Best popcorn for me I put my saliva on it. No I do women's

702
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:31,720
deodorant. Yeah? Because it makes me horny. That sounds good. Yeah cuz it got like

703
00:37:31,720 --> 00:37:37,480
female pheromones they put in and extract them from squirrels. Cool. Yeah.

704
00:37:37,480 --> 00:37:43,160
Female deodorant doesn't kill you. Male deodorant, you put it under

705
00:37:43,160 --> 00:37:46,520
your arms and make some rock hard like the thing. Well, it takes, well female

706
00:37:46,520 --> 00:37:51,120
deodorant has female pheromones in it and male deodorant has male

707
00:37:51,120 --> 00:37:55,440
pheromones in it, aluminum, which we all produce and women go crazy for. Why do you

708
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:58,520
think they use it to cover their food when they're cooking? Oh my god, now I

709
00:37:58,520 --> 00:38:04,440
I just realized that. Women love to roast a pepper and cover it in aluminum because a pepper is phallic.

710
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:10,680
So I found this forum thread here. This is speaking of Hollywood and popcorn.

711
00:38:10,680 --> 00:38:11,960
This is Mr. Movies?

712
00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:16,360
This is Blu-ray.com, which apparently they have a forum on Blu-ray.com.

713
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:23,000
And this is in the movies subcategory of the movies category of the Blu-ray forum.

714
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:27,560
The other day I saw a photo, it's one of the worst photos of Doug Benson I've ever seen,

715
00:38:27,560 --> 00:38:31,920
but it was on blu-ray.com is this the same website if it's blu-ray.com it would be

716
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:37,120
the same website yes okay that's lit that's lit as hell um this is a thread

717
00:38:37,120 --> 00:38:40,440
so I thought we you know we it's no secret we love movies we talked about

718
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:44,040
movies a lot already today we were just talking about great about where we love

719
00:38:44,040 --> 00:38:47,960
movies we're great at movie ideas we're always coming up with good movie ideas I

720
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:52,600
feel like maybe we could we could make a career that's true yeah I think we could

721
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:56,080
I think we could make a career is as script doctors and kind of a ritual

722
00:38:56,080 --> 00:38:59,640
- Retool movie ideas and make movie ideas better

723
00:38:59,640 --> 00:39:00,900
and we could probably market this

724
00:39:00,900 --> 00:39:01,740
and I wanna do this as a--

725
00:39:01,740 --> 00:39:02,940
- I forget both of you guys have college degrees.

726
00:39:02,940 --> 00:39:03,780
- I wanna do this--

727
00:39:03,780 --> 00:39:04,600
- Almost have one.

728
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:05,440
- I wanna do this--

729
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:06,280
- Not almost.

730
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:07,100
- He was on--

731
00:39:07,100 --> 00:39:09,600
- I was on the path to almost having

732
00:39:09,600 --> 00:39:11,100
maybe a screenwriting degree

733
00:39:11,100 --> 00:39:13,180
or just a general movies degree.

734
00:39:13,180 --> 00:39:14,020
- Guys, this is important.

735
00:39:14,020 --> 00:39:14,860
- Sorry, sorry, finish your intro.

736
00:39:14,860 --> 00:39:16,700
- This is for our careers, okay?

737
00:39:16,700 --> 00:39:18,540
If you wanna ever work in this industry

738
00:39:18,540 --> 00:39:20,180
without a college degree, you better listen

739
00:39:20,180 --> 00:39:21,100
'cause what we're doing today

740
00:39:21,100 --> 00:39:23,300
is I found this thread on blu-ray.com

741
00:39:23,300 --> 00:39:26,300
called movie ideas by this user here

742
00:39:26,300 --> 00:39:29,300
valerious and I thought maybe we could

743
00:39:29,300 --> 00:39:30,740
read this person's movie ideas and we

744
00:39:30,740 --> 00:39:32,780
could kind of script doctor them for

745
00:39:32,780 --> 00:39:33,780
them and this could be you know we could

746
00:39:33,780 --> 00:39:35,420
send this as a resume to the big shot

747
00:39:35,420 --> 00:39:37,660
Hollywood. Now this is making me think too much of

748
00:39:37,660 --> 00:39:39,900
college. I think I'm blacklisted. Yeah

749
00:39:39,900 --> 00:39:41,580
really this might be this might get you

750
00:39:41,580 --> 00:39:43,260
out off the list I think if we do a good

751
00:39:43,260 --> 00:39:44,540
enough job. This is making me think too

752
00:39:44,540 --> 00:39:45,940
much of college and now I just want to

753
00:39:45,940 --> 00:39:48,620
pound a beer. That's right. Here's the

754
00:39:48,620 --> 00:39:50,660
beginning post of the thread okay. I want

755
00:39:50,660 --> 00:39:52,860
to play beer pong or flip cup. Okay this

756
00:39:52,860 --> 00:40:07,240
This is my third thread so far, Whippity Pow, and I found hopefully the right forum to do

757
00:40:07,240 --> 00:40:08,240
this.

758
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:11,100
Post your movie ideas right here, because I've been planning this for some nights now, so

759
00:40:11,100 --> 00:40:12,100
have fun.

760
00:40:12,100 --> 00:40:18,140
Note, the phrase Whippity Pow is used in the 1983 Mexican cartoon movie, Katy Caterpillar.

761
00:40:18,140 --> 00:40:21,160
I feel like using this phrase because I feel happy.

762
00:40:21,160 --> 00:40:25,640
note the 2008 movie Little Big Planet will appear in this thread since it fits

763
00:40:25,640 --> 00:40:29,840
okay is there a movie is that is that photo is that katie caterpillar i would

764
00:40:29,840 --> 00:40:32,360
assume that's katie caterpillar is there a little big planet movie can you check

765
00:40:32,360 --> 00:40:35,520

774
00:41:12,600 --> 00:41:17,000
Hello sack Cole. Hey sack boy part two girl talk

775
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:24,800

776
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:31,680
I'm out sack girl rides her skateboard and exits part three fourth wall

777
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:37,480
Hi, yeah, what part for the end

778
00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:41,520
Thank you, you're welcome

779
00:41:41,520 --> 00:41:48,440
Deleted scenes one sack boy is zip riding it to school to the four girls are trying to get a date three sack

780
00:41:48,440 --> 00:41:52,640
Mom is punched by sack boy. That's rude. Yeah, wait. There's some quotes

781
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:53,000
Oh

782
00:41:53,000 --> 00:42:00,560
They have a cast here sack boy voice by Frank Welker a teenager with no personality in sack girls love interest sacral voice by Greg

783
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:02,560
Griffin a tomboy in sack boys love interest

784
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:07,580
Saki voice by Matthew Lillard a weird risk hidden sack boys best friend the movies rated PG

785
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:14,120
Wow okay no wait wait look at that note note do not take this seriously oh it's

786
00:42:14,120 --> 00:42:19,400
a comedy well damn okay that's why there's punching moms let's that's why

787
00:42:19,400 --> 00:42:26,000
sack boy see sack mom and sack mom and sack dad get into you can you it's it's

788
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:31,080
implied but it's not explicitly written that sack dad is beating the crap out of

789
00:42:31,080 --> 00:42:35,120
sack mom and sack boys learning from his dad and he's having an incestuous

790
00:42:35,120 --> 00:42:39,400
relationship. So mostly what the Little Big Planet movie is about is about the

791
00:42:39,400 --> 00:42:45,080
cycle of abuse. Yeah. But it's not serious though. But it is, it's a

792
00:42:45,080 --> 00:42:48,960
light-hearted... so this is like the I, Tonya of Sackboy movies. You know what's

793
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:53,080
the movie that I've always wanted to see is a virtual buddy movie. Interesting.

794
00:42:53,080 --> 00:42:57,360
Yeah. Right? Okay. Where maybe you get... maybe you can get Sackboy as a

795
00:42:57,360 --> 00:42:59,960
virtual buddy skit. Well that's what I'm saying and maybe he's getting it

796
00:42:59,960 --> 00:43:07,860
exploded and stuff and we hear we hear I hurt myself today and maybe we're

797
00:43:07,860 --> 00:43:11,580
sending nuclear missiles at his body and he's looking like George Bush and crap

798
00:43:11,580 --> 00:43:15,700
he's jumping all over the place getting points and stuff yeah to see if I still

799
00:43:15,700 --> 00:43:23,500
feel right yeah and I don't really know where I would go from there.

800
00:43:23,500 --> 00:43:26,720
Well it wouldn't be a parody song that would be kind of disrespectful it's more

801
00:43:26,720 --> 00:43:31,960
about it's more about it's not it's not hurt it's kind of a movie that self-harm

802
00:43:31,960 --> 00:43:35,420
Patrick you're just making it's not Johnny Cash it's not like when they when

803
00:43:35,420 --> 00:43:39,540
Polaris did hey Sandy for Pete and Pete and they changed the lyrics I don't know

804
00:43:39,540 --> 00:43:44,840
what the hell you're fucking talking about or like when they change the

805
00:43:44,840 --> 00:43:49,940
friends theme song because it used to not be I'll be there for you I don't know

806
00:43:49,940 --> 00:43:53,520
what I'm gonna ignore you now okay all right I'm just I'm gonna read I'm gonna

807
00:43:53,520 --> 00:43:57,120
to read valerius is for music version of now that we have the now that we have

808
00:43:57,120 --> 00:43:59,680

809
00:43:59,680 --> 00:44:03,480

810
00:44:03,480 --> 00:44:07,360
movie that i'm planning to make the plot to it after a sighting of an unknown

811
00:44:07,360 --> 00:44:11,840
spacecraft has landed on the ocean side of earth the ocean side sasuke from

812
00:44:11,840 --> 00:44:16,600
pan yo and pan yo discovered a very new life form a sack alien named sack boy

813
00:44:16,600 --> 00:44:20,160
together with the help of other unordinary people they need to stop an

814
00:44:20,160 --> 00:44:24,320
alien threat from destroying all of Earth companies Walt Disney Pictures Marvel

815
00:44:24,320 --> 00:44:30,200
Studios Pixar Animation Studios Studio Ghibli and Amblin Entertainment rated pg-13

816
00:44:30,200 --> 00:44:34,600
for intense sequences of sci-fi action violence and disturbing images okay this

817
00:44:34,600 --> 00:44:38,520
sounds a lot different from the movie we just yeah read the script for got a

818
00:44:38,520 --> 00:44:45,440
ponyo yeah it's got ponyo in it and you know what it would be it said Marvel

819
00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:51,520
Disney Amblin it would be a great merger. Who's Amblin? Amblin is a Steven

820
00:44:51,520 --> 00:44:56,840
Spielberg. Amber Pamblin? I think that means ET might be in it.

821
00:44:56,840 --> 00:45:02,400
Yeah I think ET yeah ET's definitely gonna be in it. Yeah if it's about aliens and it has Amblin.

822
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:08,360
Yeah if not in the movie in the title card for Amblin.

823
00:45:08,360 --> 00:45:14,800
it really amblin right Easter Sunday yeah wait I think Easter is Easter Sunday

824
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:19,280
made by amblin or dreamworks I don't know Steven Spielberg's involved I'll and

825
00:45:19,280 --> 00:45:24,520
that's all I know about it so we get Joe Koya's kind of licensed yeah yeah he

826
00:45:24,520 --> 00:45:30,240
could he looks just like him just have you cross hatch him I like this I will

827
00:45:30,240 --> 00:45:35,320
say as a professional screenwriter I like this idea but it needs more we need

828
00:45:35,320 --> 00:45:38,220
of screenplay needs a beginning middle and then this is just a beginning. So

829
00:45:38,220 --> 00:45:42,640
here's my thing if you're already going PG-13 why not go full are even x-rayed

830
00:45:42,640 --> 00:45:47,340
and show full penetration on Sackboy. Well yeah, he has a zipper and then

831
00:45:47,340 --> 00:45:53,320
he could he could unload his big white cock. BWC. It was cocks white. Sackboy is

832
00:45:53,320 --> 00:45:59,320
not a white guy. He's Sack. His insides are white. I just I want to do big white

833
00:45:59,320 --> 00:46:05,800
white cock. I just wanted to see one so I put it so I just involved it yeah.

834
00:46:05,800 --> 00:46:09,280
That's a fine say what there's no there are no bad ideas and screenwriting

835
00:46:09,280 --> 00:46:14,800
actually yeah in regards a big white no definitely the fucking sack boy and

836
00:46:14,800 --> 00:46:18,840
then a bad idea Luria says that's my first movie anyone want to join like

837
00:46:18,840 --> 00:46:22,320
join on as a producer or something because yeah I would I would join I

838
00:46:22,320 --> 00:46:28,200
think I could be a good et then we got then we have this is ten minutes later.

839
00:46:28,200 --> 00:46:32,240
i should bring in a new movie idea so here's this one the math bear movie

840
00:46:32,240 --> 00:46:36,400
all my god the plot to it a band of thief bears plans to attempt to steal twenty

841
00:46:36,400 --> 00:46:39,720
million dollars from a high facility protected bank is the math there the

842
00:46:39,720 --> 00:46:44,480
bastard squad what else can go wrong companies warner brothers pictures

843
00:46:44,480 --> 00:46:48,840
village roadshow pictures metro goldwyn-mayer fund a mation gonzo be

844
00:46:48,840 --> 00:46:52,440
trained productions rated are for extended sequence of strong bloody

845
00:46:52,440 --> 00:46:56,520
pervasive violence had language throughout and for some sexual contact

846
00:46:56,520 --> 00:47:02,120
So this is my question. Wait, Gonzo the production company or Gonzo the Great?

847
00:47:02,120 --> 00:47:03,580
What do you think?

848
00:47:03,580 --> 00:47:04,520
I don't know.

849
00:47:04,520 --> 00:47:09,160
That's why I'm asking. Companies. Companies. Okay, well the company that these

850
00:47:09,160 --> 00:47:13,560
bears keep could be Gonzo the Great. Well they might be doing some Gonzo pornography

851
00:47:13,560 --> 00:47:18,520
filming. This seems more in line with your pitch. So what I'm saying is, here's what I'm saying.

852
00:47:18,520 --> 00:47:21,560
So the Bastard Bears, okay first of all the movie should be called The Bastard Bears.

853
00:47:21,560 --> 00:47:25,960
The Bastard Squad. It has nothing to do with math except the fact that there's a number of money

854
00:47:25,960 --> 00:47:27,700
- High number of-- - Yeah, which I guess is,

855
00:47:27,700 --> 00:47:29,340
maybe there's a scene where they're adding it,

856
00:47:29,340 --> 00:47:30,860
they're like, wait, how much money is that?

857
00:47:30,860 --> 00:47:33,700
One dollar plus one dollar, they're counting all of it.

858
00:47:33,700 --> 00:47:35,340
- They have a calculator, they're doing--

859
00:47:35,340 --> 00:47:39,080
- Calculator, but here's my only punch-up scene, right?

860
00:47:39,080 --> 00:47:41,940
One bear, he's barely legal, he's 18.

861
00:47:41,940 --> 00:47:43,360
- That's his name? - Yeah, his name is

862
00:47:43,360 --> 00:47:44,860
Barely Legal, yep. - Barely Legal.

863
00:47:44,860 --> 00:47:46,820
- And that's a part, maybe we rename the movie

864
00:47:46,820 --> 00:47:48,940
Barely Legal. - 'Cause they're robbing.

865
00:47:48,940 --> 00:47:50,420
- Yes. - Oh my God.

866
00:47:50,420 --> 00:47:51,620
- Also-- - That's perfect.

867
00:47:51,620 --> 00:47:55,380
- Also, the newly 18 young stud of a bear, right,

868
00:47:55,380 --> 00:47:59,020
and he's been trying, well all these older women have been trying to fuck him the whole movie.

869
00:47:59,020 --> 00:48:02,280
He finally shaves his pubes, or his hair, but he thinks it's his pubes because he's been

870
00:48:02,280 --> 00:48:04,500
watching too many YouTube tutorials.

871
00:48:04,500 --> 00:48:11,980
He unfolds his fucking hair, peels it back with a fucking, with a peeler, like a potato,

872
00:48:11,980 --> 00:48:16,300
big white cock.

873
00:48:16,300 --> 00:48:18,040
Big white fucking dripping cock.

874
00:48:18,040 --> 00:48:20,420
That would fit perfectly with some sexual content.

875
00:48:20,420 --> 00:48:21,420
Oh, yes.

876
00:48:21,420 --> 00:48:23,540
It might not fit perfectly into a woman.

877
00:48:23,540 --> 00:48:27,780
I think that would bring the movie up to NC 17 maybe well no because they showed a penis

878
00:48:27,780 --> 00:48:28,780
in Boogie Nights.

879
00:48:28,780 --> 00:48:33,140
It's animated it's like it's like fucking hot dog party or fun.

880
00:48:33,140 --> 00:48:34,140
It's fun.

881
00:48:34,140 --> 00:48:35,140
It's fun.

882
00:48:35,140 --> 00:48:36,140
It's fun.

883
00:48:36,140 --> 00:48:37,140
A funimation.

884
00:48:37,140 --> 00:48:38,140
Yeah it's funimation.

885
00:48:38,140 --> 00:48:39,140
Yeah so it's an animated movie obviously we don't have real bears that can do this kind

886
00:48:39,140 --> 00:48:40,940
of stunt with a big white cock.

887
00:48:40,940 --> 00:48:44,140
Well they did it in Jackass.

888
00:48:44,140 --> 00:48:47,900
They had a bear doing a stunt but they cut out the part with the white cock.

889
00:48:47,900 --> 00:48:49,940
That was in Jackass 4.5.

890
00:48:49,940 --> 00:48:51,980
They put the part with the white cock in.

891
00:48:51,980 --> 00:48:52,980
I might have to check that out.

892
00:48:52,980 --> 00:48:58,420
yeah proof of concept yeah and then valeria says about twenty minutes later

893
00:48:58,420 --> 00:49:01,100
or even know less than twenty minutes later want me to go into details of

894
00:49:01,100 --> 00:49:04,780
these two movies just replying to themselves yeah just all this and then

895
00:49:04,780 --> 00:49:09,220
this this person here this amaze runner another user does kind of this is kind

896
00:49:09,220 --> 00:49:13,140
of an inside baseball movie idea. So this is something that maybe could break out

897
00:49:13,140 --> 00:49:17,100
all like a small scene yeah it's exactly like money ball this says jennifer

898
00:49:17,100 --> 00:49:20,760
lawrence fan and monterey jack are blu-ray dot com's biggest theatrical

899
00:49:20,760 --> 00:49:23,260
fans and their worlds come crashing down when their local

900
00:49:23,260 --> 00:49:26,360
theaters close for good due to covid. Both users are eight

901
00:49:26,360 --> 00:49:29,360
hours away from the nearest open theater and it's the same movie

902
00:49:29,360 --> 00:49:32,460
theater. Brie Larson is going to make an in-person cameo for a

903
00:49:32,460 --> 00:49:35,260
re-release of Captain Marvel at that theater in two weeks and

904
00:49:35,260 --> 00:49:39,060
there's only one ticket left, but the theater doesn't do online

905
00:49:39,060 --> 00:49:41,860
ticketing. So the two blu-ray users who have no vehicle and

906
00:49:41,860 --> 00:49:44,860
can't drive must race to that theater to see who can get that

907
00:49:44,860 --> 00:49:48,960
final ticket. Who's Monterey Jack? These are two, I think

908
00:49:48,960 --> 00:50:08,400
to

909
00:50:08,400 --> 00:50:13,320
past or something good idea and it's Jennifer Lawrence yeah doing an in-person

910
00:50:13,320 --> 00:50:18,600
meet-and-greet because one person has clear motivation there not saying who

911
00:50:18,600 --> 00:50:22,240
Jennifer Lawrence and who does she play mystique right yeah so she's there with

912
00:50:22,240 --> 00:50:26,280
her blue breasts just one blue and who does she turn into Johnny Sins Johnny

913
00:50:26,280 --> 00:50:31,400
guess what white well you it's blue it says pg-13 movie you can't show a white

914
00:50:31,400 --> 00:50:36,360
cock in that you could you can get away with one can't show white cock in a pg-13

915
00:50:36,360 --> 00:50:37,360
You could show...

916
00:50:37,360 --> 00:50:45,480
You've never turned over a DVD thing and said PG-13, mild violence, mischievous themes, and

917
00:50:45,480 --> 00:50:46,480
big white cock.

918
00:50:46,480 --> 00:50:47,480
I will say...

919
00:50:47,480 --> 00:50:48,480
I will say...

920
00:50:48,480 --> 00:50:52,080
PG-13 movie and I... because I'm... it usually says unrated on the front, but then on the

921
00:50:52,080 --> 00:50:53,080
back it says PG-13.

922
00:50:53,080 --> 00:50:54,200
Yeah, that's true.

923
00:50:54,200 --> 00:50:56,000
This one does not specify PG-13.

924
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:57,000
Oh, it doesn't?

925
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:58,000
No, it doesn't.

926
00:50:58,000 --> 00:50:59,000
I must have misheard.

927
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:00,000
No, you misheard.

928
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:01,000
I was...

929
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:02,000
I will say, any movie...

930
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:05,800
I mean, knowing the Blu-ray community, any movie that's going to be centered on this community,

931
00:51:05,800 --> 00:51:09,220
gonna be at least x-rated yeah all right we can put a big it down we put a white

932
00:51:09,220 --> 00:51:12,280
cock in this whatever yeah we'll put that's the main note I would say for

933
00:51:12,280 --> 00:51:15,880
this one a white cock well especially Jennifer Lawrence I think that a lot of

934
00:51:15,880 --> 00:51:20,000
people might actually enjoy that yeah she's so it's a big white cock fucking

935
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:25,360
blue breasts what she can't fuck her own breasts in the movie so she half of her

936
00:51:25,360 --> 00:51:33,320
is blue yeah and then the bottom half has a male genitalia white cock white

937
00:51:33,320 --> 00:51:38,520
white cock and she looks like a cat dog but half blue half cat half white cock

938
00:51:38,520 --> 00:51:41,720
yeah and they're talking there's gonna be a spin-off cartoon called blue and

939
00:51:41,720 --> 00:51:51,400
white cock in there and she and it's a remake of blue cock white call blue top

940
00:51:51,400 --> 00:51:56,600
white cock here's a little thing called a blue and white cock here's a sequel

941
00:51:56,600 --> 00:52:01,320
idea from valerius okay okay little big planet two the plot of it years have

942
00:52:01,320 --> 00:52:03,320
since sack boy met Sasuke and Ponyo.

943
00:52:03,320 --> 00:52:06,320
Sack boy is now an adult, but he gets sucked into a virtual

944
00:52:06,320 --> 00:52:08,320
reality game called Sword Art Online.

945
00:52:08,320 --> 00:52:10,320
I really don't like the name "Sack Adult".

946
00:52:10,320 --> 00:52:12,320
He's stuck there and has to fight Nexus,

947
00:52:12,320 --> 00:52:15,320
a program that gone into Sword Art Online and takes control.

948
00:52:15,320 --> 00:52:19,320
Along with Sasuke and his new partner Asuna from Sword Art Online,

949
00:52:19,320 --> 00:52:23,320
they go on a journey to fight Nexus and save the people who's stuck in Sword Art Online.

950
00:52:23,320 --> 00:52:27,320
Companies Walt Disney Pictures, Marvel Studios, Pixar Animation Studios,

951
00:52:27,320 --> 00:52:31,400
entertainment studio Ghibli rated PG-13 for intense sequences of sci-fi action

952
00:52:31,400 --> 00:52:36,840
violence and frightening images. This is Spy Kids 3. Yeah, first of all this is Spy Kids 3.

953
00:52:36,840 --> 00:52:41,560
Second of all it seems like that's just putting Sackboy and

954
00:52:41,560 --> 00:52:45,040
Ponyo and Sword Art Online. I don't know why they have all the other

955
00:52:45,040 --> 00:52:49,960
entertainment companies. Yeah, they need production companies for money.

956
00:52:49,960 --> 00:52:53,360
If you guys don't like this idea I'll just throw in another one right away.

957
00:52:53,360 --> 00:52:56,720
the sequel is completely soft more yeah yeah we'll tell we'll throw your

958
00:52:56,720 --> 00:53:00,080
slump this is the this is a different one okay okay this one out for you

959
00:53:00,080 --> 00:53:04,960
Pikachu the plot to it after the events of Pokemon the power of us Ash Ketchum

960
00:53:04,960 --> 00:53:08,920
gives up on Pikachu and Pikachu has started to be wild okay when he gets

961
00:53:08,920 --> 00:53:12,980
attacked by a Tyranitar a villain saved him Harley Quinn Pikachu and Harley

962
00:53:12,980 --> 00:53:16,920
Quinn teams up to save Aurora City from the tyrannical hush who wants to

963
00:53:16,920 --> 00:53:21,200
destroy both humans and Pokemon the Ash Ketchum saga is coming to an end

964
00:53:21,200 --> 00:53:26,640
companies Warner Bros. Pictures, The Pokemon Company, Legendary Pictures, DC Comics, Syncope,

965
00:53:26,640 --> 00:53:31,800
rated PG-13 for sci-fi action violence, disturbing images, and thematic elements throughout.

966
00:53:31,800 --> 00:53:34,460
So that's Hush from Batman.

967
00:53:34,460 --> 00:53:35,460
That's what I would guess.

968
00:53:35,460 --> 00:53:36,460
Okay.

969
00:53:36,460 --> 00:53:37,460
But I really don't know.

970
00:53:37,460 --> 00:53:43,240
So if you know it, Hush is one of, is like Bruce Wayne's like equal.

971
00:53:43,240 --> 00:53:45,320
Hush is like, he's like a surgeon.

972
00:53:45,320 --> 00:53:50,900
If I'm remembering correctly, Hush is a guy who gets a bunch of surgery to look like Bruce

973
00:53:50,900 --> 00:53:56,740
Wayne what and he starts doing crimes as a villain yeah that's so fucking funny

974
00:53:56,740 --> 00:54:02,200
it's cool yeah I bet they're gonna do him for the next Batman movie so to put

975
00:54:02,200 --> 00:54:06,460
hush in it he probably dresses up in girls clothes - yeah Bruce Wayne no that's

976
00:54:06,460 --> 00:54:11,140
what he does that's a good idea he dresses up as Bruce Wayne and and become

977
00:54:11,140 --> 00:54:17,580
a lady yeah he probably does like super kind of like sus shit yeah you know so he

978
00:54:17,580 --> 00:54:21,860
probably goes to a glory hole and sucks it off on video. Yeah, people does glory

979
00:54:21,860 --> 00:54:26,900
hole pictures as Bruce Wayne. People are starting to get angry at at Valerius.

980
00:54:26,900 --> 00:54:30,500
Okay, so really is post an idea for a little big planet three the battle for

981
00:54:30,500 --> 00:54:34,100
Earth. Yeah, Ronan the accuser is plan to take over Earth and make it extinct

982
00:54:34,100 --> 00:54:38,380
forever. Yeah, the other guardians etc. etc. It's guardians of the galaxy people

983
00:54:38,380 --> 00:54:41,300
are somebody post a YouTube link the Truman Show. What the hell are you

984
00:54:41,300 --> 00:54:45,140
talking about? Valerius is I'm taking that I'm taking it that nobody's liking

985
00:54:45,140 --> 00:54:48,500
threat don't understand what the third little big planet movies about someone

986
00:54:48,500 --> 00:54:52,060
says what about little big planet four and puts a nail-biting of animated

987
00:54:52,060 --> 00:54:55,380
emoticon which I think is probably sarcastic unfortunately someone says

988
00:54:55,380 --> 00:55:00,220
this isn't even interesting trolling and then and then Valeria says there is a

989
00:55:00,220 --> 00:55:03,740
little big planet for I'll talk about it once I'm done watching a video here

990
00:55:03,740 --> 00:55:07,700
about alcohol and all that how to prevent it how to prevent alcohol so

991
00:55:07,700 --> 00:55:11,180
that ties into the straightedge thing we were talking about earlier little big

992
00:55:11,180 --> 00:55:15,080
planet for dark planet. So they finished watching the video about about alcohol.

993
00:55:15,080 --> 00:55:20,420
Wait, wait, wait. Can you when did they post that one? Wow, 707. They became

994
00:55:20,420 --> 00:55:25,540
dark and twisted. It took 37 minutes. They became dark and twisted because they

995
00:55:25,540 --> 00:55:28,580
realized the reality of alcohol addiction. Yeah. And they made a dark

996
00:55:28,580 --> 00:55:32,060
planet episode. Dark planet. The plot. Sackboy has to deal with his enemy years ago.

997
00:55:32,060 --> 00:55:37,100
Scorpius from Farscape. What is Farscape? That's an old sci-fi show. Okay. If

998
00:55:37,100 --> 00:55:40,740
Sackboy wants to save Earth, he'll have to fight Scorpius on the dark planet

999
00:55:40,740 --> 00:55:45,280
get dacker companies, Walt Disney Pictures, Marvel Studios, Pixar

1000
00:55:45,280 --> 00:55:47,620
Animation Studios, Amblin Entertainment, Studio Jubilee,

1001
00:55:47,620 --> 00:55:51,300
rated PG thirteen for intense sequences of sci fi action and violence and

1002
00:55:51,300 --> 00:55:54,640
frightening images throughout and also how to prevent alcohol. Try not to

1003
00:55:54,640 --> 00:55:57,480
take it always look at what you're drinking because you might die from it.

1004
00:55:57,480 --> 00:56:01,100
Do not take alcohol a message for you before I go on with more ideas that is

1005
00:56:01,100 --> 00:56:04,100
there is a little bit planified by the way. Have fun with that

1006
00:56:04,100 --> 00:56:06,960
that's actually fucking real shit.

1007
00:56:08,040 --> 00:56:11,760
it's so true yeah just pay attention to what you're drinking and don't take

1008
00:56:11,760 --> 00:56:16,400
alcohol. Little big planet five rise of ultron the plot ultra has been set from

1009
00:56:16,400 --> 00:56:20,080
the future to destroy the past sack boy and his new crew of heroes must take

1010
00:56:20,080 --> 00:56:23,240
down the ultimate threat. Well, that will determine the future of the planet and

1011
00:56:23,240 --> 00:56:27,560
it's the same studios, the same PG thirteen type writing back to the

1012
00:56:27,560 --> 00:56:31,160
pikachu movie. How do you think of it being directed by Christopher Nolan? I

1013
00:56:31,160 --> 00:56:34,880
think honestly, Chris Nolan like once he gets done with Oppenheimer and shit,

1014
00:56:35,680 --> 00:56:38,800
he might knock that out of the park. Nolan's Pikachu is probably going to be

1015
00:56:38,800 --> 00:56:40,200
the the blockbuster hit of the

1016
00:56:40,200 --> 00:56:46,200
trailer where it's like in the world will change and it has like a countdown

1017
00:56:46,200 --> 00:56:49,560
the most important creature in the world and then a light.

1018
00:56:49,560 --> 00:56:56,240
I'll be going now. See you guys tomorrow. Does he come back? I honestly

1019
00:56:56,240 --> 00:56:59,640
didn't read this far in the thread because there's I will say we won't get

1020
00:56:59,640 --> 00:57:02,320
through it because there are twenty three pages of this.

1021
00:57:03,200 --> 00:57:08,800
there's a message there from COVID. Who was banned. Holy shit. Thank God they banned COVID.

1022
00:57:08,800 --> 00:57:13,520
Yeah, I would hope so. Okay, honestly never seen a thing like this before. A little worried to post

1023
00:57:13,520 --> 00:57:17,280
here, but here's the one movie idea I can recall creating outside of fictional things I've written.

1024
00:57:17,280 --> 00:57:22,880
This must be what got them banned. This is a good movie idea. Title, isn't it? Dot, dot, dot,

1025
00:57:22,880 --> 00:57:28,080
question mark. Also chose the tagline, not what you're thinking. After that, admittedly zero

1026
00:57:28,080 --> 00:57:32,400
development except for how it would go as the phrase go a hundred and film have

1027
00:57:32,400 --> 00:57:36,240
before and then left turn issues I found every time I think it through is there

1028
00:57:36,240 --> 00:57:42,040
are 100 ways a million stories go so too many unused to choose from not only that

1029
00:57:42,040 --> 00:57:46,160
but many likely unchosen due to the inability of people to find ways close

1030
00:57:46,160 --> 00:57:49,720
to them which I would obviously have to do if I chose the not overdone

1031
00:57:49,720 --> 00:57:54,200
continuation this is a genius idea this guy wants to make a movie that the story

1032
00:57:54,200 --> 00:57:58,640
has a twist that people that the story hasn't done before and it's called it's

1033
00:57:58,640 --> 00:58:02,720
called is it and the tagline is not what you're thinking and the twist is that

1034
00:58:02,720 --> 00:58:06,560
something happens that's a total left turn uh-huh it will be hard to do

1035
00:58:06,560 --> 00:58:09,880
because there have been hundreds of movies the twist is something happens

1036
00:58:09,880 --> 00:58:14,200
that you're not expecting that's the twist that's pretty genius idea that's

1037
00:58:14,200 --> 00:58:19,040
pretty fucking genius maybe the twist is kovat 90 oh shit well I'm a little big

1038
00:58:19,040 --> 00:58:24,160
planet Dark Phoenix there he made a Dark Phoenix movie well this is a little big

1039
00:58:24,160 --> 00:58:27,100
Little Big Planet six Dark Phoenix, so it's different than the normal Dark

1040
00:58:27,100 --> 00:58:30,600
Phoenix movie. You can kind of guess what this one's about yeah. Here's

1041
00:58:30,600 --> 00:58:33,800
another one goes bigger. This time the new Avengers the plot after the

1042
00:58:33,800 --> 00:58:36,960
events of Little Big Planet six Dark Phoenix sack boy now has amnesia and

1043
00:58:36,960 --> 00:58:40,460
does not remember anything from meeting up with a mysterious bear doll named

1044
00:58:40,460 --> 00:58:44,780
joy from napping princess the both in them and the new and recruited members

1045
00:58:44,780 --> 00:58:48,800
must fight off against Dark Helmet from space balls from taking the planet's

1046
00:58:48,820 --> 00:58:54,660
there again the same companies here. These are all so so valerius is just good at

1047
00:58:54,660 --> 00:59:00,080
just making amalgamations of of movies little big planet seven origins the plot

1048
00:59:00,080 --> 00:59:03,340
after the events of the new avengers sack boy meets his bloodline. Vincent

1049
00:59:03,340 --> 00:59:08,580
Valentine, final fantasy seven yeah and it just it keeps going this person. I

1050
00:59:08,580 --> 00:59:13,720
will also I don't drink beer only root beer. So is this don't listen to them

1051
00:59:13,720 --> 00:59:16,220
just drink a couple of beers and everything will be okay and then

1052
00:59:16,240 --> 00:59:19,520
valerius replies and says I don't drink beer only root beer, but not other

1053
00:59:19,520 --> 00:59:22,820
beers, but thanks for your support. That's very nice only root beer for

1054
00:59:22,820 --> 00:59:24,340
very. I really want

1055
00:59:24,340 --> 00:59:29,120
somebody asked can Pikachu get Harley Quinn pregnant. That's not how the

1056
00:59:29,120 --> 00:59:31,920
movie went, but there were a few suggestive moments where Pikachu

1057
00:59:31,920 --> 00:59:35,520
actually kisses Harley Quinn having no idea what he's doing. I like

1058
00:59:35,520 --> 00:59:42,420
valerius. I like valerius. I'm just saying that the leader is has yeah

1059
00:59:42,420 --> 00:59:45,340
benefit of the big planet ate the summer soldier.

1060
00:59:45,340 --> 00:59:50,340
(laughter)

1061
00:59:50,340 --> 00:59:56,840
"Ready to PG-13 for intense sequences of sci-fi action violence, gunplay language, and some suggestive comments."

1062
00:59:56,840 --> 00:59:59,340
What is the summer soldier?

1063
00:59:59,340 --> 01:00:04,340
"Sackboy and Vincent fight against an advanced soldier from Sackboy's home planet that is destroyed."

1064
01:00:04,340 --> 01:00:05,340
Okay.

1065
01:00:05,340 --> 01:00:07,340
"Sackboy has to fight his own battles if he wants to survive."

1066
01:00:07,340 --> 01:00:11,340
I noticed the description of these plots are a little... Oh, the Math Bear movie 2!

1067
01:00:11,340 --> 01:00:14,340
Oh, the Math Bear movie 2! The plot! The bastard squad is back!

1068
01:00:14,340 --> 01:00:18,140
black the street time this time no rules to the game when the math bears are

1069
01:00:18,140 --> 01:00:23,040
assigned to steal one billion dollars at a casino ruthless ganglord brian griffin

1070
01:00:23,040 --> 01:00:27,940
from family guy goes in to kill the bastard squad off what are their options

1071
01:00:27,940 --> 01:00:31,840
rated are for strong bloody violence and pervasive language throughout and for

1072
01:00:31,840 --> 01:00:35,140
some sexuality and we already know what that is yeah i think we know exactly

1073
01:00:35,140 --> 01:00:38,840
brian and train here's the here's a here's a twist you could put this in

1074
01:00:38,840 --> 01:00:42,740
isn't it brian griffin shaves his hair off guess what's underneath his white

1075
01:00:42,740 --> 01:00:43,240
here.

1076
01:00:43,240 --> 01:00:48,340
Black dog, you know, no, just a big black cock, okay, so he's got a it's kind

1077
01:00:48,340 --> 01:00:52,500
of a reverse of the bear. Oh my God, it is I'm scrolling or got to a little

1078
01:00:52,500 --> 01:00:58,420
big planet eleven. There's so we the new avengers three patamons awakening part

1079
01:00:58,420 --> 01:01:03,580
one holy shit. This person is it is an idea machine. The math bear movie three

1080
01:01:03,580 --> 01:01:08,420
busted no blue bear tries to get rid of his paranoia of clowns. He talks to his

1081
01:01:08,420 --> 01:01:11,660
therapist about his paranoia, but sooner or later he has his paranoia consuming

1082
01:01:11,680 --> 01:01:15,280
and he becomes a clown himself. The Bastard Squad has to find a way to bring one of their

1083
01:01:15,280 --> 01:01:20,160
compadres back. Rated R for horror violence, grisly images, and strong language.

1084
01:01:20,160 --> 01:01:22,640
No nudity in that one. If you like LittleBigPlanet this much, I'm

1085
01:01:22,640 --> 01:01:24,880
sorry to say this, but this will be the end of it.

1086
01:01:24,880 --> 01:01:26,620
That's horrible news. Maybe that means there's an extra, maybe

1087
01:01:26,620 --> 01:01:30,600
that means there's a last one. There's new movies. Maybe Sackboy, holy shit.

1088
01:01:30,600 --> 01:01:32,960
I hope so. LittleBigPlanet 12 Last Life.

1089
01:01:32,960 --> 01:01:34,720
There it is. Yep, that's probably the last one.

1090
01:01:34,720 --> 01:01:37,880
Wait, will you scroll up for a second? I saw something about anal sex.

1091
01:01:37,880 --> 01:01:44,280
Oh yeah here it is somebody posted a movie about Freddy Krueger and Jesus that

1092
01:01:44,280 --> 01:01:47,640
has anal sex and animal torture they're kind of being a mean and they said

1093
01:01:47,640 --> 01:01:53,440
jokes that Beyonce and Miss Swan from that TV are gonna be in that the new

1094
01:01:53,440 --> 01:01:57,840
Avengers for the case of Pikachu we've got here the animos oh there's a new one

1095
01:01:57,840 --> 01:02:01,760
this is new the animal it's a set in the same universe I'm seeing now but it does

1096
01:02:01,760 --> 01:02:09,700
to bring Hamtaro into the mix. Okay, it's pretty big Puru so this mit here's the

1097
01:02:09,700 --> 01:02:13,300
cast of the math bear movie. Since people are liking it, Blue Bear, Brad Pitt,

1098
01:02:13,300 --> 01:02:18,140
Red Bear, Channing Tatum, Green Bear, Mila Kunis, Yellow Bear, Angelina Jolie

1099
01:02:18,140 --> 01:02:21,680
and here's the spoiler for the day in the new Avengers three, Patamon's

1100
01:02:21,680 --> 01:02:25,000
awakening part one, Brian Griffin makes an appearance in this movie, but is a

1101
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:29,580
reincarnation of Megatron from Transformers. Holy Shit, all right, so I

1102
01:02:29,620 --> 01:02:33,460
I mean there's some this I will say I eventually I feel like we can come back

1103
01:02:33,460 --> 01:02:37,540
to this because we are we're not even like a quarter through of the movie ideas

1104
01:02:37,540 --> 01:02:41,660
yeah this is also only one of many threads that this person has and also

1105
01:02:41,660 --> 01:02:44,180
something I noticed when we started recording that I didn't look at yet it

1106
01:02:44,180 --> 01:02:49,020
shows I think you can view what their blu-ray and DVD collection are and see

1107
01:02:49,020 --> 01:02:53,100
what movies they own they own okay it looks like a lot of Marvel movies here

1108
01:02:53,100 --> 01:02:57,700
only on blue I said right well these are blu-rays they had a lot more DVDs okay

1109
01:02:57,700 --> 01:03:02,100
some anime they have Jurassic World Fallen Kingdom they have the Hunger Games

1110
01:03:02,100 --> 01:03:07,700
Mockingjay part 2. Let's look at their DVDs they had 219 DVDs. Wow they have

1111
01:03:07,700 --> 01:03:13,780
10,000 BC that's sick. 13 going on 30? Dope. Agents of Shield. What a good

1112
01:03:13,780 --> 01:03:19,380
they have Dragon Hearts. They have the entire Dragon Hearts. Holy crap. What a collection.

1113
01:03:19,380 --> 01:03:23,460
They have multiple Fantastic Four movies. They have the Equalizer. They have the Dark Crystal. Gemini Man.

1114
01:03:23,460 --> 01:03:25,460
I mean, I've seen some Godzilla movies here.

1115
01:03:25,460 --> 01:03:29,460
Make no mistake, this is a film buff the likes of which we haven't seen since Godzilla.

1116
01:03:29,460 --> 01:03:35,460
Jonah, a VeggieTales movie. I mean, this is, yeah, this person, somebody in Hollywood needs to reach out to Hilarious.

1117
01:03:35,460 --> 01:03:37,460
This is the kind of cinephile that needs to be working behind the scenes.

1118
01:03:37,460 --> 01:03:38,460
Absolutely.

1119
01:03:38,460 --> 01:03:42,460
Right? Their talents are wasted posting on this Blu-ray forum.

1120
01:03:42,460 --> 01:03:48,460
So if anybody is on a, if we have anybody from any talent agencies who are listening, please sign this person.

1121
01:03:48,460 --> 01:03:49,460
Please, yeah, send us.

1122
01:03:49,460 --> 01:03:50,460
Sign Hilarious.

1123
01:03:50,460 --> 01:03:55,460
of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles DVDs too. Oh yeah, Secret of the Ooze. Wow, so many. Oh

1124
01:03:55,460 --> 01:04:00,060
my gosh, a lot of X-Men. I mean great, great, great stuff. Great ideas. Great movies that

1125
01:04:00,060 --> 01:04:03,580
I like. Almost no notes besides the big white cock thing. Yeah, listen, I mean the big white,

1126
01:04:03,580 --> 01:04:08,580
you could add a couple of big white cocks and make them maybe spurt cum and... And maybe

1127
01:04:08,580 --> 01:04:10,580
have it beat up at the tip a little bit right before it squirts out. And part of it, it

1128
01:04:10,580 --> 01:04:14,340
could be a sex appeal thing, but then in some movies you could actually use that for comic

1129
01:04:14,340 --> 01:04:17,940
relief because what's funnier than a fucking big white cock nutting all over the floor?

1130
01:04:17,940 --> 01:04:19,220
Yeah. So there's my only notes.

1131
01:04:19,220 --> 01:04:24,420
The funniest part of every movie that I've seen is when they jizz on the lady in the end.

1132
01:04:24,420 --> 01:04:24,920
Exactly.

1133
01:04:24,920 --> 01:04:27,720
And that's the...

1134
01:04:27,720 --> 01:04:30,820
Talk about a twist ending, isn't it? It's not what you're thinking.

1135
01:04:30,820 --> 01:04:34,260
And the Halloween live show will have a twist ending. I'm just realizing now that I think

1136
01:04:34,260 --> 01:04:35,860
about what we're talking about right now...

1137
01:04:35,860 --> 01:04:36,360
Yep.

1138
01:04:36,360 --> 01:04:38,660
But it doesn't involve jizz.

1139
01:04:38,660 --> 01:04:40,500
The twist might be that it involves this.

1140
01:04:40,500 --> 01:04:42,100
There might be jizz. I don't know.

1141
01:04:42,100 --> 01:04:44,660
I don't think there's going to be a cum shot at the show.

1142
01:04:44,660 --> 01:04:46,740
I think there might be a squirt shotter.

1143
01:04:46,740 --> 01:04:51,060
there might be a come shot but go buy tickets to it at swag.com/shows

1144
01:04:51,060 --> 01:04:56,180
and uh bye bye bye tickets
