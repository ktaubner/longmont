1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,880
I can do the friendship to do is opening with a friendship tattoo. Does this work? Is this

2
00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:21,560
what you got to wet it? I think you got to wear the what are you giving him a friendship

3
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:28,560
It's not a swastika, is it? No. You've done that before. I've never drawn a swastika on you.

4
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:33,060
I don't even know what a swastika looks like. Whoa, that's beautiful. I'm going to get...

5
00:00:33,060 --> 00:00:37,980
Oh my God. It's a heart. I didn't expect that to work. I'm going to bring this to a real

6
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:44,560
tattoo artist and I'm going to get it put in there. Really? This heart? I'm going to

7
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:47,560
take a picture of it so they have a reference and then I'm going to put it right there.

8
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:51,260
you take a picture right now. I think it's a beautiful job. Well, I'm not

9
00:00:51,260 --> 00:00:54,860
taking a picture of you. Okay, and then air drop it to me. All right,

10
00:00:54,860 --> 00:00:59,760
okay, wait, why don't people say that? Because people say, take a picture and

11
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:03,260
then Caleb, you're in it, make a little face, be proud of it, be proud of your

12
00:01:03,260 --> 00:01:07,160
tattoo. People say, guys, people say, hey, why don't you take a picture? It'll

13
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:11,260
last longer, but what lasts longer than a tattoo? Picture, I say,

14
00:01:11,260 --> 00:01:15,460
after a person dies, exactly. A picture doesn't last that long either. A

15
00:01:15,460 --> 00:01:18,180
picture of a tattoo lasts 10 times as long.

16
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:19,180
So what do you say?

17
00:01:19,180 --> 00:01:20,860
If somebody's staring at you, what do you say?

18
00:01:20,860 --> 00:01:23,180
Hey, how about you get a tattoo of me?

19
00:01:23,180 --> 00:01:24,180
On your back?

20
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:25,180
On your back, because that'll last longer.

21
00:01:25,180 --> 00:01:26,180
Like Steve-o.

22
00:01:26,180 --> 00:01:27,180
Yeah.

23
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:31,500
What if you get a tattoo of me on your back with my thumbs up?

24
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:35,940
But then you run the risk of running into somebody who's very, very gullible and they

25
00:01:35,940 --> 00:01:36,940
may take that seriously.

26
00:01:36,940 --> 00:01:37,940
Yeah.

27
00:01:37,940 --> 00:01:41,420
But if they take a picture, then it's like, all right, you can delete it.

28
00:01:41,420 --> 00:01:42,420
But if it's a tattoo, then...

29
00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:43,420
And that's an expensive tattoo that could ruin somebody's life.

30
00:01:43,420 --> 00:01:47,660
second rule to delete tattoos. You can delete them through laser beams. No, they're going

31
00:01:47,660 --> 00:01:51,580
to have an X button on them and someone can run up on the street and press X on it. Oh,

32
00:01:51,580 --> 00:01:54,860
come on man! That cost me thousands of dollars. What the fuck was that man? That'd be good

33
00:01:54,860 --> 00:01:59,860
for prisoners though. I got that's Kat Von D, put that on my back. I spent ten thousand

34
00:01:59,860 --> 00:02:04,860
dollars on that. I forgot that she's a tattoo artist every single time. I thought that in

35
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:10,980
my head she's just Bam Margera's friend. Yeah, I honestly, she is a waitress in my brain.

36
00:02:10,980 --> 00:02:14,820
he's a well. That was the thing back in the day. You could just be like a goth

37
00:02:14,820 --> 00:02:18,740
girl on my space and then that's how you got famous. You can still do that.

38
00:02:18,740 --> 00:02:22,460
That's not what she's famous. Yeah, doing yeah, I'm going to be a goth girl

39
00:02:22,460 --> 00:02:23,420
on my space then

40
00:02:23,420 --> 00:02:28,140
and then I'm going to be super famous. Oh, my God, honestly, but you can you

41
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:28,380
can

42
00:02:28,380 --> 00:02:34,980
and I get those big scene bangs. Yeah, oh, my God, I'd be so beautiful and

43
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:37,700
they fight yeah, and then the scene guy with a

44
00:02:38,980 --> 00:02:42,420
you still get famous by being a goth girl on myspace and you basically still can but instead

45
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:44,620
of being on myspace you just have to be on CNN.

46
00:02:44,620 --> 00:02:45,620
Yeah.

47
00:02:45,620 --> 00:02:46,620
True.

48
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:47,620
So it's not that big a difference.

49
00:02:47,620 --> 00:02:48,620
It's true.

50
00:02:48,620 --> 00:02:49,620
There's too many goths on CNN.

51
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:50,620
I know.

52
00:02:50,620 --> 00:02:53,660
I'm so fucking sick of these goth girls on CNN.

53
00:02:53,660 --> 00:02:58,340
How about instead of going on CNN you go on to YouTube again where you're home, where you

54
00:02:58,340 --> 00:03:02,700
come from and make videos of you being random again.

55
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:04,180
Now you're telling the news?

56
00:03:04,180 --> 00:03:05,180
What the hell?

57
00:03:05,180 --> 00:03:06,180
Yeah.

58
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:08,180
I think you guys should be on RedTube and stuff all the way.

59
00:03:08,180 --> 00:03:11,380
You're naked and showing their, spreading their assholes, putting stuff in there.

60
00:03:11,380 --> 00:03:12,380
What?

61
00:03:12,380 --> 00:03:14,980
Just a better...

62
00:03:14,980 --> 00:03:19,180
That's really like half of the people who are goths, they do that.

63
00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:25,060
If you have really, really brightly white skin, I feel like you gotta be goth.

64
00:03:25,060 --> 00:03:26,060
Yeah.

65
00:03:26,060 --> 00:03:27,060
Yeah.

66
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:28,060
It's kinda your lot in life.

67
00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:29,060
That's where you end up.

68
00:03:29,060 --> 00:03:30,060
Because what else are you gonna do?

69
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:31,060
Speaking of...

70
00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:32,060
You're fucking useless, bro.

71
00:03:32,060 --> 00:03:33,060
Yeah.

72
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:53,060
I'm

73
00:03:53,060 --> 00:03:55,260
fixing myself. No, come on. What is it?

74
00:03:55,260 --> 00:03:57,260
You're perfect just the way you are.

75
00:03:57,260 --> 00:04:00,260
I'm going to fix myself. I've been wearing new clothes.

76
00:04:00,260 --> 00:04:01,260
I don't want to...

77
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:03,260
No, we had this discussion already.

78
00:04:03,260 --> 00:04:04,260
I'm going to throw out all of my t-shirts.

79
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:05,260
You wore that shirt already.

80
00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:09,260
But I'm wearing only normal-ass adult grown man butt-downs.

81
00:04:09,260 --> 00:04:11,260
This is still a funny shirt.

82
00:04:11,260 --> 00:04:12,260
This is not a funny shirt.

83
00:04:12,260 --> 00:04:14,260
This is probably the funniest shirt that you've ever worn, to be honest.

84
00:04:14,260 --> 00:04:17,260
It's literally some kind of Middle East dollar.

85
00:04:17,260 --> 00:04:18,260
It's ironical.

86
00:04:18,260 --> 00:04:20,260
It's not ironical. It's actually...

87
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:21,260
It's ironical.

88
00:04:21,260 --> 00:04:28,360
It's pro-Iraq. It's iracical. It's pro-Iraq shirt. How is it pro-Iraq? It's just a picture

89
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:37,860
of money. Yeah. It's pro-the guy does look a lot like Jubio though. It is pro-Iraqi dinar.

90
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:41,540
This does look a lot like Jubio. Speaking of, how fucked is it? I got a little Jubio

91
00:04:41,540 --> 00:04:47,780
in my pocket. We're working on Memorial Day and he's a veteran. Yeah. He fought in the

92
00:04:47,780 --> 00:04:48,780
the Mexican War.

93
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:54,440
We don't smile. I don't smile. You can't even see you. Can you can you add your

94
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:55,660
webcam as a source?

95
00:04:55,660 --> 00:05:00,020
Wouldn't it be cool? And then we can cut to the Jubio cam. If we visited Mexico

96
00:05:00,020 --> 00:05:02,700
and Jubio was like a full war hero.

97
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:06,740
The thing that always makes me laugh always to tell everyone is that he's a

98
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:10,300
he in Mexico, he's the most famous pop star in the country. Yeah.

99
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:11,420
That he like performed.

100
00:05:11,420 --> 00:05:14,260
Yeah, we kind of couldn't believe this.

101
00:05:14,260 --> 00:05:15,860
The biggest comedian.

102
00:05:17,420 --> 00:05:22,620
I looked up, I was looking at the Wikipedia page for the city that Juvio is from.

103
00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:23,620
Yeah.

104
00:05:23,620 --> 00:05:26,040
And it's a big, big city.

105
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:30,400
And I looked at the, I was just reading the Wikipedia page and it had a notable people

106
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:31,720
thing.

107
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:34,340
And it's like 7 million people live in the city.

108
00:05:34,340 --> 00:05:35,340
One notable person.

109
00:05:35,340 --> 00:05:36,340
Uh huh.

110
00:05:36,340 --> 00:05:37,340
Uh huh.

111
00:05:37,340 --> 00:05:38,340
Who?

112
00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:39,340
In 150 years.

113
00:05:39,340 --> 00:05:40,340
Him?

114
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:41,340
Him?

115
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:42,340
No, it was like some bitch from the 1800s.

116
00:05:42,340 --> 00:05:43,340
He should be.

117
00:05:43,340 --> 00:05:44,340
How is there no notable people from this?

118
00:05:44,340 --> 00:05:45,340
Yeah.

119
00:05:45,340 --> 00:05:46,340
Wilmington, North Carolina has like 25 notable people.

120
00:05:46,340 --> 00:05:47,340
Do you know what I learned today?

121
00:05:47,340 --> 00:05:53,080
12 that maybe I assume you want to film on the Wikipedia. No, you're not. No way. I

122
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:58,280
tried to add myself, which I'm sure you know this. I had no idea that Venus fly

123
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:03,160
traps. They only live around Wilmington. Yeah, I didn't know that at all. Yeah,

124
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:07,200
they're like, why you go see it? You see wild. It's like, but they don't live

125
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:10,300
like anywhere else. I thought you were going to say that Venus fly trap was

126
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:16,120
like a notable or maybe not even 50 miles. Okay. Yeah. So it's like a Venus

127
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:18,520
Flytrap good name for a my Carolina.

128
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:22,520
Wilmington is the northern most subtropical climate

129
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:24,520
in the world.

130
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:27,020
Wow, and that's the blend for whatever reason.

131
00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:29,120
It's the only place that they ever have been.

132
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:30,120
That's pretty crazy.

133
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:31,020
I had no idea.

134
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:32,020
What about a tropical?

135
00:06:32,020 --> 00:06:33,420
So really not that cool though.

136
00:06:33,420 --> 00:06:34,020
They're cool.

137
00:06:34,020 --> 00:06:35,820
I saw kind of cool, but they're really small.

138
00:06:35,820 --> 00:06:38,100
Yeah, they're not as big as the cool thing is when you put a

139
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:40,120
pencil in its mouth that kills it.

140
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:40,520
Yeah,

141
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:43,320
what tropical sub

142
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:48,860
Spam, pineapple, King's Hawaiian sub.

143
00:06:48,860 --> 00:06:51,160
You want to talk to me about Hawaiian breakfast right now?

144
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:54,160
Maybe some like fried rice patties onto it.

145
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:55,160
No, no, no.

146
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:58,160
I'm thinking ideas to get us out the hood.

147
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:02,160
I'm thinking tropical sub, Hawaiian sub.

148
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:05,660
Oh, you're saying we somehow make a Hawaiian roll that goes all the way.

149
00:07:05,660 --> 00:07:06,660
Yeah.

150
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:07,660
An all the way roll.

151
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:08,660
A foot long Hawaiian roll.

152
00:07:08,660 --> 00:07:11,660
That is actually a foot long Hawaiian roll.

153
00:07:11,660 --> 00:07:13,660
Just in general, maybe even a foot long roll.

154
00:07:13,660 --> 00:07:18,980
pineapple. Yeah, maybe even that we put spam on it. The way I apples

155
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:23,380
teriyaki. You don't want pineapple. They don't put pineapple on the spam, man.

156
00:07:23,380 --> 00:07:27,860
That's not good news. Okay, then we'll do like a bit. It's like a big.

157
00:07:27,860 --> 00:07:32,340
What do you mean? They put the big the grilled? Yeah, we put grilled pineapple

158
00:07:32,340 --> 00:07:36,780
on it. No, you don't want a spam sandwich. I've done that that you just

159
00:07:36,780 --> 00:07:40,500
are an idiot. Then I thought that was I'm sorry. What's the friendship? What

160
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:44,500
What did we say today's episode was? I thought that was the egg split sandwich.

161
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:49,500
That place sucks shit. I wouldn't trust that place. You made those sandwiches for us.

162
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:53,500
This just reminded me. Not with pineapple. I thought there was pineapple on it.

163
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:57,500
No, you crazy piece of shit. Oh no, it was spam and eggs, god damn it.

164
00:07:57,500 --> 00:08:01,500
You thought an egg was pineapple because it's yellow? Yes. What is wrong with you?

165
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:06,500
I guess it has a hard exterior. But it would be kind of good. Hard to eat from the outside.

166
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:10,400
outside. I don't like pineapple. I had an incredible idea for a TV show.

167
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:10,900
It's called "Taste Bad."

168
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:13,100
Yes.

169
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:14,600
It's supposed to.

170
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:19,500
It's supposed to be caustic. I don't want good tasting cum. It might come

171
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:22,600
tasting like candy. That would be, that's bad. Yeah, it's not right.

172
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:26,000
Because I'd be eating it all the time. Yeah. No, my idea for a TV show,

173
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:30,600
because we went to get chilaquiles, me and... Say it the right way.

174
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:31,800
He's right there.

175
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:35,100
Say, how am I supposed to say it? What did I say wrong? You just said

176
00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:37,100
- Chilaquiles. - Chilaquiles.

177
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:39,100
- Chilaquiles. - A little more.

178
00:08:39,100 --> 00:08:41,100
- Chilaquiles. - Chilaquiles.

179
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:43,100
- Chilaquiles. - Chilaquiles.

180
00:08:43,100 --> 00:08:45,100
- And I had the most incredible idea for a TV show,

181
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:47,100
which is that he comes to New York City.

182
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:49,100
- Yeah. - He is a food reviewer,

183
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:51,100
but he's not reviewing the taste of the food,

184
00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:53,100
he's only reviewing whether or not it is auténtico.

185
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:55,100
- Okay. - And he starts out,

186
00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:57,100
the first one he has Mexican food, he says,

187
00:08:57,100 --> 00:08:59,100
"This isn't really auténtico." Second episode,

188
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:01,100
he has Chinese food. He says,

189
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:03,100
"This is not auténtico. We do not eat this in Mexico."

190
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:03,600
so

191
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:11,200
different cultures for everything. This is not authentic. That's a great idea.

192
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:11,660
We

193
00:09:11,660 --> 00:09:16,640
don't eat this type of that's a good point, like walking up to the manager of

194
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:20,720
the restaurant, just be like and I love the food. It was amazing. I got the

195
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:25,460
char siu pork. I loved it so much, but unfortunately this is not authentic to

196
00:09:25,460 --> 00:09:26,020
Mexico.

197
00:09:26,020 --> 00:09:31,260
From authentic Mexico, far from it. They're just getting so mad,

198
00:09:32,740 --> 00:09:36,440
so we put a giant sticker on the restaurant door. This is not

199
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:37,940
authentic, not authentic,

200
00:09:37,940 --> 00:09:45,600
in small red letters that blend in of Mexican food. Yeah, it's in front of

201
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:49,880
like a pizza place, but in front of like a great food reviewer personality.

202
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:54,900
Yeah, on a I think he's too shy. He is too shy. He is so incredibly shy.

203
00:09:54,900 --> 00:09:57,880
Yes, shyness. He does have shine in a way that can't be. I mean, it's

204
00:09:57,880 --> 00:10:01,980
terminal. He misbehaves in restaurants to does he misbehave at restaurants?

205
00:10:02,060 --> 00:10:05,740
He says his shyness causes misbehavior.

206
00:10:05,740 --> 00:10:09,340
You can't, well then you can come over here if you want to talk but you shouldn't.

207
00:10:09,340 --> 00:10:09,980
You're in the room and you can't defend yourself.

208
00:10:09,980 --> 00:10:10,660
Yeah, fuck you.

209
00:10:10,660 --> 00:10:11,660
What does he do?

210
00:10:11,660 --> 00:10:16,100
He orders something and they say they bring him the wrong thing and he goes like this.

211
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:20,340
And then the person asks me, "Oh, you didn't ask for this?"

212
00:10:20,340 --> 00:10:21,660
I'm like, "I don't know, you have to talk to him."

213
00:10:21,660 --> 00:10:22,980
And he's like this, "I'm too shy."

214
00:10:22,980 --> 00:10:24,940
Oh yeah, I did witness this.

215
00:10:24,940 --> 00:10:28,100
Wait, you do, I thought you only did this at English speaking restaurants.

216
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:29,460
He does it at Mexican restaurants too?

217
00:10:29,460 --> 00:10:30,940
These motherfuckers speak Spanish.

218
00:10:30,940 --> 00:10:36,080
Spanish. They do speak Spanish. You're a liar. He started speaking Spanish to

219
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:39,640
her and she said I didn't couldn't tell because it was all in Spanish. What

220
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:43,480
was going on? Well, he has a very anything what I've learned. I say he

221
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:46,520
doesn't understand people with different accents, so like it

222
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:51,560
apparently every the gap between his accent and everybody else's accent is

223
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:58,320
the same as like the the Creole Cajun accent and like most other American

224
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:01,860
by you boy. So that's what I mean. He had he has the version walking around and

225
00:11:01,860 --> 00:11:06,260
people are like kind of giggling when you speak Spanish. Yeah, he speaks it like a

226
00:11:06,260 --> 00:11:11,060
fool. I've actually I've witnessed that too. I saw the I saw this coffee incident

227
00:11:11,060 --> 00:11:15,360
that you're talking about. We were all we were all at getting which there was

228
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:19,660
two. There's two coffee incidents and one was averted by me. The second that's

229
00:11:19,660 --> 00:11:24,760
the one you saw it happened. The second one the he I had to say so that's four

230
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:27,660
more coffees right to the waitress, because I could tell that something got

231
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:28,100
lost

232
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:32,100
and I fixed it and it still got messed up, but it wasn't my fault. You know you

233
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:37,060
saying he misbehaves at restaurants. I do want to point out on Saturday night.

234
00:11:37,060 --> 00:11:38,420
There was a chase.

235
00:11:38,420 --> 00:11:45,460
You there was a chase. There's a there was a incident, a chasing incident. I am

236
00:11:45,460 --> 00:11:49,100
at the bar. I'm sorry real quick. I have to say this is almost feeling like the

237
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:49,940
opposite of the

238
00:11:51,340 --> 00:11:56,540
episode. It seems like we're dissecting our friend in a very rude way.

239
00:11:56,540 --> 00:12:02,300
Home and I just want to say that I just want to... I don't think that you guys

240
00:12:02,300 --> 00:12:06,780
were... I don't think you guys witnessed this, but a group of men on the street

241
00:12:06,780 --> 00:12:09,100
certainly witnessed it and were very scared.

242
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:16,380
Did you chase? You chased Patrick down the street? I'm at the bar.

243
00:12:17,420 --> 00:12:20,660
I'm ordering wings for me and my girlfriend to share because we were

244
00:12:20,660 --> 00:12:25,380
very drunk. I order myself a Dacote as well. I'm standing there waiting.

245
00:12:25,380 --> 00:12:29,500
I don't remember what happened, but all of a sudden,

246
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:33,500
I'm a block away from the bar we were at,

247
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:38,380
turning the corner and Jubio is chasing me down the street.

248
00:12:38,380 --> 00:12:42,260
That's not right. There's too big of a size difference.

249
00:12:42,260 --> 00:12:44,300
People are going to assume the worst. I'm also kind of,

250
00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:48,060
I'm also I'm kind of worried and scared about the gap between the gap here

251
00:12:48,060 --> 00:12:51,260
between ordering wings and you're around the corner being chased. Yeah,

252
00:12:51,260 --> 00:12:55,740
what happened there? I don't know. It was all a blur. I'm running down the

253
00:12:55,740 --> 00:12:59,620
street in my suit. What I'm getting here maybe is from you is that instinctively

254
00:12:59,620 --> 00:13:03,300
you are kind of a prey animal where you see a predator on the hunt. Like

255
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:07,180
Jibio. And yeah, and you kind of exactly a predator like him. I don't remember

256
00:13:07,180 --> 00:13:11,780
what happened. All I know is that it's fighter flight kicked in. You flighted.

257
00:13:11,820 --> 00:13:20,200
I ran out of the bar and then I ran a full city block and then I came back and

258
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:24,540
tried to pretend like I did not get chased. But you did fully got scared of

259
00:13:24,540 --> 00:13:28,900
it. Then the way of a night's job, you have to come here and explain what

260
00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:34,180
happened because I did not talk to the men. The men came and questioned him.

261
00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:38,860
The men talked to him. Yeah, go come this way. No, it was just a group of

262
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:40,700
guys. I don't care about the story. So you

263
00:13:40,700 --> 00:13:48,600
So we're at the bar. I can hear myself. We're at the bar and I just come up to

264
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:51,100
Patrick like, "Hey, what's up Patrick? How are you doing?" And he just takes off

265
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:51,600
running.

266
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:54,100
I'm like,

267
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:58,100
that's not what happened. He takes off running.

268
00:13:58,100 --> 00:14:03,600
I did not. You did. He takes off running and I go, "I must get him unless he gets

269
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:08,600
lost." And I just chase after him. He is changing the story up. I must get him

270
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:12,240
I think it's a bar in my neighborhood. I know the city.

271
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:15,440
I think you guys saw the dogs playing and you wanted to try it yourself.

272
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:16,800
Do you hear what you said? Say it again.

273
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:18,360
I don't remember.

274
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:21,840
Yeah. Okay. So keep that in mind. I chased him.

275
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:24,320
He gets to the corner and turns the corner. I'm like, I don't want to do that.

276
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:25,480
I'm going to go back to the bar.

277
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:27,720
And you were in a goofy mood.

278
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:28,040
Yeah.

279
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:32,160
You were in a goofy mood and you wanted to chase me and you initiated the chase.

280
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:33,720
There was three men. Oh my God.

281
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:37,520
There was three men, like a doorstep and they're like, everything all right.

282
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:39,420
I'm like, yeah, we're just playing around.

283
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:48,320
2.30 in the morning, maybe no, this is midnight. Midnight. Yeah.

284
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:49,420
Yeah.

285
00:14:49,420 --> 00:14:52,700
So I get back to the bar. I'm like, I don't know where Patrick is. It's been

286
00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:54,120
like a couple minutes.

287
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:58,600
So you circle the block because I thought it would be funny to walk by

288
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:02,100
and pretend like I don't know you. Yeah, and he finally gets back and he has

289
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:04,520
his phone open with Apple Maps on it because he got

290
00:15:07,420 --> 00:15:08,120
their maps.

291
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:14,720
Okay, I did want to confirm that I was on the right street. Yes. All right, so I

292
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:18,600
didn't, I wanted to confirm that I didn't overshoot. We've done a lot of

293
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:21,480
running around that bar recently when I got dropped off there the other day. You

294
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:25,160
did run, I got out of the bar and then just ran away from the bar because I

295
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:28,280
needed to say, well, me and Patrick were sitting there, we're waiting for Julio

296
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:31,920
and Caleb and Patrick pointed to a funny looking guy and said, oh, there's Julio

297
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:34,660
and I turn and of course, what happened? He's the guy who's behind me. I turned

298
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:38,220
around, made eye contact with the guy and immediately started laughing by

299
00:15:38,220 --> 00:15:41,540
looking at this man who was walking up to us. I felt pretty bad about that,

300
00:15:41,540 --> 00:15:42,020
and then

301
00:15:42,020 --> 00:15:45,960
a little later Patrick went, "Oh, there's Caleb," and I turned and I saw a

302
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:49,460
guy who looked a little bit like Caleb, and a full sprint across the street.

303
00:15:49,460 --> 00:15:53,800
Full exact, he's wearing this hat, which is unmistakable. Yeah, and I was

304
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:54,640
like, "Wait,

305
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:57,640
that is Caleb." Yeah, it was, man. I completely thought I was getting... And

306
00:15:57,640 --> 00:16:00,400
then he came back with a veggie wrap. It wasn't a veggie wrap, it was a

307
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:02,680
turkey sandwich. Oh, alright. It wasn't a... Turkey wrap. It was a

308
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:06,340
it's a spin a trap. Yeah, the reason why was because I've been so sick that I was

309
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:10,680
having acid reflux because the only thing in my stomach was my own mucus. Yeah, I

310
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:15,480
needed to eat something so bad that is nasty and so I had to run. I ran ain't

311
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:19,580
that is nasty. I'm pro people don't like running in public. I do it almost every

312
00:16:19,580 --> 00:16:22,320
time I need to be somewhere or I just want to be somewhere a little bit

313
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:26,620
faster. I will. I used to I used to I was one of the kids in who used to run

314
00:16:26,620 --> 00:16:30,160
through the school hall. Yeah, I don't really have. I think that shit was fire.

315
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:32,600
I think people have a shame about that.

316
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:33,600
I would run in circles.

317
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:34,600
On more than one occasion.

318
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:36,160
God gave me these amazing long legs for a reason.

319
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:39,000
I live close enough to that train stop.

320
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:44,200
On more than one occasion where like you know where that restaurant, the garlic to the chicken

321
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:45,200
is.

322
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:46,200
Yeah.

323
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:52,400
I have been turning the corner, see the train pull up and I just bolt.

324
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:53,400
I just fucking.

325
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:54,640
For some reason I won't run to a train.

326
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:55,640
I bolt, I will.

327
00:16:55,640 --> 00:17:00,840
I can make it because I have a small window where I can make it.

328
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:02,840
You know where you can make it.

329
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:05,840
I know the window you're in, but then I'm like, I'm running.

330
00:17:05,840 --> 00:17:10,340
That Forrest Ave stop sucks so bad because there's the one spot where everyone can get out.

331
00:17:10,340 --> 00:17:13,340
So I run and I get out.

332
00:17:13,340 --> 00:17:18,840
What I do when I'm trying to catch the train, I would never break into a full run,

333
00:17:18,840 --> 00:17:24,840
but I do the long leg. I'm fully running with my legs, but I'm not doing anything with my upper body.

334
00:17:24,840 --> 00:17:30,680
because I can stride big. You should do this with your upper body. I might start doing

335
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:35,080
that. That's my favorite thing to do if I'm running to something that I want to get too

336
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:40,640
fast is to just go really far with my legs. I think that's so fun. I do have very short

337
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:49,160
legs so it looks like plankton walking. I also have short legs. It sucks having short

338
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:53,040
ass legs. I basically have a demon inside me that lets me move fast when I want. Having

339
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:58,400
short legs is probably I think I should get like checks from the government. The

340
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:01,800
cereal yeah, you should get checked for being gay. No,

341
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:11,300
don't put the squeeze remix that the squeeze don't put the squeeze sounded

342
00:18:11,300 --> 00:18:16,040
that's the squeeze. So that is the squeeze. I actually don't know what

343
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:19,960
that boing I was going to call it this brine, but the original yeah, what was

344
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:24,060
Where's the original boing from just a boing? Yeah, what do you mean? I mean,

345
00:18:24,060 --> 00:18:28,120
like just came with the road. No, no, do you know what it actually is? Okay,

346
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:32,560
sound is actually do you want the history lesson here? Give it to me. That

347
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:36,440
is an instrument called a jew's harp. Yeah, that you put into your mouth and

348
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:39,480
it's the thing. Do you know punch and judy the puppet shows they do where they

349
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:39,880
do like

350
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:45,200
with their mouth? Yeah, it's that and then we're doing that now we're doing

351
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:48,520
we're going to change this. It's also called a swizzle stick and it's like

352
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:51,660
it's like a reed that you put into your mouth and you can move it.

353
00:18:51,660 --> 00:18:56,860
I don't think it goes all the way in. It does, because sometimes you swallow it

354
00:18:56,860 --> 00:19:00,720
by accident. Yeah, I've swallowed many a jew's harp. But I'm trying to show you

355
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:03,580
where it goes, like it's like this big and it's like... Wait, so it's called a

356
00:19:03,580 --> 00:19:07,240
jew's harp or a swizzler's swizzle stick? Swizzle stick. Or maybe those are two

357
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:11,260
different things, but... We had a dude come to my elementary school to teach

358
00:19:11,260 --> 00:19:15,140
us all about folk music. It was like an artist in residence thing, and he was

359
00:19:15,140 --> 00:19:18,740
teaching us about that he went out of his way to call it a Jaws harp.

360
00:19:18,740 --> 00:19:22,180
Yeah. It's a better name. It goes between the jaws. It's a better name for sure,

361
00:19:22,180 --> 00:19:22,580
but then

362
00:19:22,580 --> 00:19:26,100
I think I tried to look it up later and then I saw it was called a

363
00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:30,460
News Harp and I went, "What the fuck?" What the... He also taught us how

364
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:33,820
to play the spoons on our knees. What are those? What's that? It's so funny

365
00:19:33,820 --> 00:19:37,580
to tell a story and end it with, and I went and then go,

366
00:19:37,580 --> 00:19:42,020
"What the..." Y'all, it's 101. 101. Yeah, it's 101. My alarm's going off.

367
00:19:42,020 --> 00:19:47,480
just chill on me. Just chill on me, family, because I don't know how to

368
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:51,100
change it and I change it in my sleep accidentally, because sometimes I fall

369
00:19:51,100 --> 00:19:54,260
asleep with my Casio watch on and I press all the buttons and then I'll wake

370
00:19:54,260 --> 00:19:58,680
up and it'll be eleven thirty five and the alarm's going off. Wow, damn, yeah,

371
00:19:58,680 --> 00:20:02,580
you should change it. I'll change you. No, I will change you. Okay, guys,

372
00:20:02,580 --> 00:20:05,920
all right, all right, all right, cool. If you're not gonna change me about

373
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:09,620
friendship and about our friends, we've been talking about friendship. We haven't,

374
00:20:09,660 --> 00:20:13,220
we've been talking about Jews and harps and shit. We were talking about

375
00:20:13,220 --> 00:20:16,900
friendship pretty much this whole time. We were, we were looking at it from

376
00:20:16,900 --> 00:20:18,020
kind of a negative lens.

377
00:20:18,020 --> 00:20:20,820
If us three never have met each other,

378
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:26,020
how would we act? How would we act? I would be completely different. I would

379
00:20:26,020 --> 00:20:26,260
be

380
00:20:26,260 --> 00:20:30,620
probably the president, I'd probably be the president, and now you guys go

381
00:20:30,620 --> 00:20:35,500
like, "What? You wouldn't be the president of the loser club from not

382
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:39,260
having two besties. The president of the not having two besties

383
00:20:39,260 --> 00:20:48,600
I would know him either. Maybe I mean good chance I probably would be working on

384
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:53,500
like an oil rig or something. No you wouldn't. That is not fucking. You would

385
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:56,600
be living at your parents house. No it would be a good chance. I'd be like. You

386
00:20:56,600 --> 00:21:01,160
would not be working on an oil. You'd not be doing anything. It's really funny to

387
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:05,600
say it like to be like yeah if I had met there's a one other person in my life I'd

388
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:07,600
working on an oil rig?

389
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:09,600
I'd probably be working construction and building the biggest building.

390
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:14,600
You would not! You would be hitting, you would do a Homer Simpson movie construction nail.

391
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:20,600
No, I'd probably, actually now that I think about it, I'd probably be working in plumbing or like some kind of HVAC.

392
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:21,600
You'd be working in HR?

393
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:23,600
No, I'd be working in electricity.

394
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:26,600
As a person who's accused of something.

395
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:28,600
I'd probably be working for, I would probably, what?

396
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:31,600
You'd be in, your job would be going into HR?

397
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:34,600
My job would not be, no, because I'd be working on the job site.

398
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:39,140
be like the CPR dummy kind of thing only bring you to be on this monster dot com.

399
00:21:39,140 --> 00:21:41,260
That's right yeah, because I'll be looking for

400
00:21:41,260 --> 00:21:44,320
rig jobs, searching

401
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:47,040
in Brooklyn.

402
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:51,180
Patrick would have actually been on monster dot com searching like food

403
00:21:51,180 --> 00:21:53,560
tester and like video game

404
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:56,960
skateboard store employee.

405
00:21:56,960 --> 00:22:03,560
What if like one day one day you guys are like you guys are downtown in

406
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:09,720
Manhattan, you're walking by, where is that? That's like first and something.

407
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:10,720
Second.

408
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:11,720
First and second.

409
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:12,720
And third.

410
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:15,760
And third. You're walking around that area and there's that big ass Zoomies that is in

411
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:17,840
a building that looks like it used to be a bank.

412
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:19,480
And what did we tell you?

413
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:25,000
You just see me in there just like folding a shirt and you're like, "Oh, what the hell?

414
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,000
He must be like looking at it."

415
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,000
Folding it to put it back.

416
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
"He must be, yeah, folding it to put it back."

417
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,000
Yeah, he tried it on.

418
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,880
And then you see me and I'm putting like ten more shirts out. I'm just working it.

419
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:37,080
I'm working at Zoomies and you walk in, I pretend like I don't know you. I'm just

420
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:40,080
like, "Hey, what's going on?" And then you're like, "Oh, you must know my

421
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:44,040
brother, my brother Patrick." My name tag says Ricky.

422
00:22:44,040 --> 00:22:48,360
I'm just in this Zoomies and I have a backwards hat on. Oh my God, you're

423
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:52,480
starting a second life as Ricky. Yeah. Oh my God, I have gauges that you

424
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:53,080
don't know about.

425
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:58,760
I got big as like the spikes, like the trainers, and you're like, "What the

426
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:04,520
I look different enough that you're like, "This guy definitely has to be Ricky."

427
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:06,160
And you've worked at Zoomies for a long, long time.

428
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:09,120
I've worked at Zoomies the whole time I've lived in New York.

429
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:13,200
The three years I've been here, I've worked at that Zoomies.

430
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:20,080
My whole job is making the worst custom skateboard for a fat teenager.

431
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:22,920
It's got pink trucks with a big blue grip tape.

432
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:27,400
Listen guys, before we get too far into having a friendship conversation...

433
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:31,400
you never resolved. You never resolved what you would you do if I you saw me

434
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:34,400
and I was Ricky. You never resolved what I would do what I would go ahead and

435
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:37,400
say. Yeah, I don't know. You guys have to decide for me. What? No, we both

436
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:40,400
decided ourselves. Okay, then I would just adapt yourself. Okay, whatever. I'd

437
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:46,400
be a musician. Okay. Yeah. Thank you. All right. Pianist. No pianist. Right.

438
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:49,400
Rango Ringo. He'd be Ringo.

439
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:56,400
The Nickelodeon. I would work. I would work. I would work. I would work. I

440
00:23:56,400 --> 00:24:00,140
You would work, yeah. I would be a good mascot guy.

441
00:24:00,140 --> 00:24:03,500
You would be at Nickelodeon Universe at the American Dream Mall and you'd be

442
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:06,440
walking around dressed up as Rango and then the security would come out and say,

443
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:10,880
"You can't fucking do that anymore, Caleb! You can't be Rango, he's not in

444
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:14,060
the park!" I could be a walk around character so easily. But you're bringing

445
00:24:14,060 --> 00:24:15,420
your own Rango costume.

446
00:24:15,420 --> 00:24:21,940
I feel like the walk around... Wait, wait, wait. Wow, yeah. Wow. And then

447
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:25,320
Can you play just like Timmy Turner sounds?

448
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:26,320
What?

449
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:29,820
He would be a perfect walk around Timmy Turner.

450
00:24:29,820 --> 00:24:31,820
You think I can play Timmy Turner sounds?

451
00:24:31,820 --> 00:24:32,820
No, Tommy Pickles.

452
00:24:32,820 --> 00:24:33,820
What is it?

453
00:24:33,820 --> 00:24:34,820
It's a costume.

454
00:24:34,820 --> 00:24:35,820
It covers your whole body.

455
00:24:35,820 --> 00:24:36,820
It's 25 years old.

456
00:24:36,820 --> 00:24:37,820
They wouldn't dress him up.

457
00:24:37,820 --> 00:24:38,820
No, that's a costume.

458
00:24:38,820 --> 00:24:39,820
No, but it's 25 years old.

459
00:24:39,820 --> 00:24:40,820
But there's like parts in Nickelodeon universe where it's like, okay, this is here for the

460
00:24:40,820 --> 00:24:41,820
adults to remember.

461
00:24:41,820 --> 00:24:42,820
They got Legends of the Hidden Temple and stuff.

462
00:24:42,820 --> 00:24:43,820
You've been in Nickelodeon universe?

463
00:24:43,820 --> 00:24:44,820
Yeah.

464
00:24:44,820 --> 00:24:45,820
I've been in Nickelodeon universe.

465
00:24:45,820 --> 00:24:46,820
I've been in Nickelodeon universe.

466
00:24:46,820 --> 00:24:47,820
I've been in Nickelodeon universe.

467
00:24:47,820 --> 00:24:48,820
I've been in Nickelodeon universe.

468
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:49,820
I've been in Nickelodeon universe.

469
00:24:49,820 --> 00:24:53,920
temple and stuff. You've been to Nickelodeon Universe? Yes. It's in the American Dream

470
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:58,580
Mall in East Rutherford, New Jersey. Okay, true. It's actually dope and we need to go

471
00:24:58,580 --> 00:25:03,000
ride the show razor. You're an actual dope. I'm sorry. Okay guys. Yeah, this is what I'm

472
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:06,800
doing. We need to get into this. We need to full screen this though. As a friendship trip

473
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:11,000
though. Can we go to the American Dream Mall? Can you just drag it over a little bit? He

474
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:18,000
can't even see it. Oh, well it's wrong. He's going to try to fix it. He's going to try and

475
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:35,000
I

476
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:55,920
and

477
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:59,800
I don't know if you could hear that. He said it's so fucked in here now. This setup will

478
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:03,400
be okay soon. Yeah. As soon as he goes home. Once we figure all this crap out. Once we

479
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:11,720
get rid of him. So today I've thought. Before we go, I'm sorry to interrupt. I did say,

480
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:16,000
should we go to America, can we go to American Dream as a friendship trip? Yes, of course.

481
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:21,160
No problem. Okay. But I'm putting, listen, friendship conversation is over until I get

482
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:29,560
through this because you're going to burn through everything. So you have to stop for now and

483
00:26:29,560 --> 00:26:34,800
just wait. Do you have my toy? Just wait. Do you have my toy? Thank you. I already got

484
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:45,000
them on. We're looking today at a website called the pleasant relationship. I googled

485
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:49,160
pleasant relationship and I feel like I would like to have a pleasant relationship with

486
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:51,620
with you guys. I feel like we have a pleasant relationship, so it seems like

487
00:26:51,620 --> 00:26:55,680
it makes sense for this to be the way. I mean, it could be more so yeah, so

488
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:59,180
this is gonna allow, you know, nothing's perfect. He's nerfect. Yeah, my dad

489
00:26:59,180 --> 00:27:02,400

544
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:45,580
start with paying him a compliment.

545
00:29:45,580 --> 00:29:49,980
So who is gonna be the tester? I think we all just have a conversation.

546
00:29:49,980 --> 00:29:54,880
Okay, I don't know what the test, the tester. Well, buddy, if I could say

547
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:59,180
one thing to you right now, if I could, I would say this. Okay, your

548
00:29:59,180 --> 00:30:03,380
hat matches your shirt in a nice way. Wow, and if I could say one thing

549
00:30:03,380 --> 00:30:08,480
to you, it would be button your shirt up. That's not a compliment. Oh, what's a

550
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:12,420
compliment? Your shirt looks good buttoned. Your shirt would look really

551
00:30:12,420 --> 00:30:15,380
good. You would look really good if you were completely covered head to toe.

552
00:30:15,380 --> 00:30:20,560
Not really a compliment. It would look really, really cute if I couldn't see

553
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:22,700
any of your body. You look good when you're sitting up straight.

554
00:30:22,700 --> 00:30:25,580
See, now it's a compliment. There you go.

555
00:30:25,580 --> 00:30:28,980
You would look really good scared,

556
00:30:30,740 --> 00:30:34,340
but with your hands out like this to there we got here's my your hands look

557
00:30:34,340 --> 00:30:35,580
so good just now yeah

558
00:30:35,580 --> 00:30:40,980
or my hand will make you I'm not for having really ugly, awful hands. You do

559
00:30:40,980 --> 00:30:43,500
have very ugly hands because of all the cuts.

560
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:48,340
I got cuts all over say that I've calluses and you guys come on my look at

561
00:30:48,340 --> 00:30:51,900
the dirt on his nails. Nothing wrong with it. You see you're supposed to

562
00:30:51,900 --> 00:30:55,380
compliment me. So your hands look as human as anybody else.

563
00:30:57,420 --> 00:31:00,420
Those look like real human grabbers.

564
00:31:00,420 --> 00:31:01,420
Thanks guys.

565
00:31:01,420 --> 00:31:02,420
Yeah.

566
00:31:02,420 --> 00:31:04,420
Those look like real human grabbers.

567
00:31:04,420 --> 00:31:05,420
Okay, let's see.

568
00:31:05,420 --> 00:31:06,420
Move forward here.

569
00:31:06,420 --> 00:31:09,420
Oh, alright, why don't you be the one who advances the slide?

570
00:31:09,420 --> 00:31:10,420
Yeah, how about you do that?

571
00:31:10,420 --> 00:31:12,420
How about we just say next slide to you?

572
00:31:12,420 --> 00:31:14,420
He doesn't know how to do anything.

573
00:31:14,420 --> 00:31:15,420
He's not good at clicking.

574
00:31:15,420 --> 00:31:16,420
Okay, can we get the next slide?

575
00:31:16,420 --> 00:31:17,420
He's a clicking problem.

576
00:31:17,420 --> 00:31:18,420
The clicker is again not working.

577
00:31:18,420 --> 00:31:19,420
There we go.

578
00:31:19,420 --> 00:31:20,420
Okay, thank you.

579
00:31:20,420 --> 00:31:21,420
Oh yeah, we're skipping some numbers here.

580
00:31:21,420 --> 00:31:22,420
Oh, alright.

581
00:31:22,420 --> 00:31:23,420
We're just going to skip to it because it's 40 things.

582
00:31:23,420 --> 00:31:24,420
Okay.

583
00:31:24,420 --> 00:31:25,420
We're not going to make it all the way through.

584
00:31:25,420 --> 00:31:26,420
Talk about your passions.

585
00:31:26,420 --> 00:31:28,420
There's a woman playing bass.

586
00:31:28,420 --> 00:31:30,420

I play nickelodeon scales. Did you guys go to college for base? I was in a

610
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:51,600
conservatory. I played with a bunch of people who played cello, French horn,

611
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:56,000
flute. I used to play on a cruise ship. Yeah. I was around Berklee, but I never

612
00:32:56,000 --> 00:33:01,360
went in. Berklee? Yeah. It's College of Music. I was around Berklee. Charles?

613
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:02,520
Stop playing that bass.

614
00:33:02,520 --> 00:33:07,560
Man, get that bass out of here. That's Shaq. That's Shaq. Berklee's up here.

615
00:33:07,560 --> 00:33:11,800
He sounds like a Muppet, like some kind of Muppet. We should just do the rest

616
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:16,680
episode of the show. You and me are kind of a Shaq and Barclay and you're Ernie.

617
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:22,520
And he's Kenny. Actually, no, Kenny Ernie. No, Ernie and Bert. Speaking of,

618
00:33:22,520 --> 00:33:26,400
by the way, you guys are Ernie and Bert. I'd like to say this. I would like to.

619
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:30,120
I would like to right now curse the Boston Celtics recording this on Monday.

620
00:33:30,120 --> 00:33:34,960
The Boston Celtics will lose tonight. Game seven. Oh, you're doing a reverse

621
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:40,200
psychology. I they're losing tonight. Okay. Yes. I'm doing a reverse curse.

622
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:45,980
Okay, smart. This is playoff game zone or yeah champion. They're down. It's the only time

623
00:33:45,980 --> 00:33:52,320
anybody if they win tonight. Only time anybody's ever come back from a zero to three game deficit

624
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:58,000
in the NBA. Wow. It's only happened in four times in any sport. That's incredible. Nope.

625
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:02,000
So make sure to make sure to reach out to your uncles tonight. Everybody. Yeah, actually

626
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:05,920
give your dose your uncles with Vive and so their hearts are racing really fucking hard

627
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:08,720
while the game's going so maybe they'll die.

628
00:34:08,720 --> 00:34:13,440
But that's the thing, your uncle has to have complete concentration on the game.

629
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:19,360
Every single uncle needs to have a mind-meld blue light thing coming out of their forehead

630
00:34:19,360 --> 00:34:21,960
headed towards Worcester Mass tonight.

631
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:23,600
Is that where they play?

632
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:26,480
No, but that's just like where most of the people, where it should be.

633
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:29,360
It should be in Worcester.

634
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:31,600
I think Boston should be replaced by Worcester.

635
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:32,920
I think Boston should be replaced by...

636
00:34:32,920 --> 00:34:35,360
I think they should move Boston to Worcester.

637
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:40,060
Yeah, we're call Worcester. They should switch them for a few years. Worcester

638
00:34:40,060 --> 00:34:44,060
is a property of Boston. Now I think Boston should I other way around. I

639
00:34:44,060 --> 00:34:48,380
honestly think Boston should be replaced by like a Godzilla foot or something. I

640
00:34:48,380 --> 00:34:52,340
think it should be wiped off the map. Let's just move on. It's got to go. It's

641
00:34:52,340 --> 00:34:56,000
got anything else. Got to go. No, you don't think next slide. Let's just go to

642
00:34:56,000 --> 00:35:01,340
the next slide. We get the next slide that he's eating his boogers. Play the

643
00:35:01,340 --> 00:35:06,140
old and famous question game. Well, I don't know what this means. Yeah, but

644
00:35:06,140 --> 00:35:09,280
what I'm seeing from the picture, if anyone can see it is a question mark

645
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:12,940
inside a square and I think it's making me think, oh, Mario, let's say it on

646
00:35:12,940 --> 00:35:16,300
three. Well, no, I guess Pat can say it on zero and then me and Caleb will say

647
00:35:16,300 --> 00:35:22,300
it on 3123 Mario. I didn't hear the on three part. Yeah, when I see a block

648
00:35:22,300 --> 00:35:26,540
like that, I fucking ran my head into it. I want money from that because I

649
00:35:26,540 --> 00:35:30,780
I want a turtle to pop out. No, let's play the question game. Okay, okay,

650
00:35:30,780 --> 00:35:35,540
twenty one questions. I don't know any questions. Just a question. Okay, three

651
00:35:35,540 --> 00:35:39,380
questions, three okay, okay, let's play three questions. Okay, I have an object.

652
00:35:39,380 --> 00:35:43,340
Okay, is it it's an object? Okay, I have an object. Is it red?

653
00:35:43,340 --> 00:35:46,620
It is. Is it a fruit?

654
00:35:46,620 --> 00:35:50,620
Is it round? Does it have one leaf?

655
00:35:55,780 --> 00:36:02,020
iconically. Yes, it does. Yeah. What is it? Is it an apple? It's a red apple.

656
00:36:02,020 --> 00:36:12,760
Yeah, it was. I was gonna guess a cherry. That's crazy that we did three questions

657
00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:16,660
and you actually got it. Yeah. I mean, I panicked and said, I just, you know,

658
00:36:16,660 --> 00:36:20,860
just agreed with him. No, no, I panicked when I chose my object. Wait, you

659
00:36:20,860 --> 00:36:23,860
actually picked apple? I swear to God, I picked a red apple.

660
00:36:23,860 --> 00:36:30,020
I was just looking at your no, no, no, no thing. Maybe that's what I was looking

661
00:36:30,020 --> 00:36:34,320
at. When I chose to yeah, that's why I said red, you would have done orange and

662
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:38,620
you would have done banana. I maybe would have done a great man, maybe a

663
00:36:38,620 --> 00:36:39,220
plantain,

664
00:36:39,220 --> 00:36:47,120
but no one to know. No, no, no, no, three questions. I've got it's mine. It's a

665
00:36:47,120 --> 00:36:50,900
concept. Okay, is that a literary concept?

666
00:36:50,900 --> 00:36:51,400
is

667
00:36:51,400 --> 00:37:00,300
I guess it could be is it in the room with us? Yes, and it's all around a

668
00:37:00,300 --> 00:37:01,620
fucking friendship. Yeah,

669
00:37:01,620 --> 00:37:06,780
God yeah, that's another win for us. All right, that's your turn. We ain't

670
00:37:06,780 --> 00:37:07,100
getting

671
00:37:07,100 --> 00:37:10,200
this is a

672
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:11,900
person.

673
00:37:11,900 --> 00:37:14,200
Is it you

674
00:37:14,200 --> 00:37:18,500
know? Is it a real person? Yes,

675
00:37:20,300 --> 00:37:29,380
question. Choose your final question. Is he wearing a hat? Famously in this room? No.

676
00:37:29,380 --> 00:37:40,260
Is it Jubio? Yes. I guess that's technically a loss. That's it. Yeah. Wait, how is that

677
00:37:40,260 --> 00:37:45,580
a loss? Because you didn't get it in three. You got it in four. I got it in three. He

678
00:37:45,580 --> 00:37:48,940
I only asked one yeah, but I think it was a collective right

679
00:37:48,940 --> 00:37:55,180
collection. I hear that collective a good time. We're going to get stricken

680
00:37:55,180 --> 00:37:57,120
from copyright YouTube. Yeah,

681
00:37:57,120 --> 00:38:02,120
we're done. All right next slide next slide, por favor.

682
00:38:02,120 --> 00:38:07,220
Okay, so this one shit bring in the S word and I know people were going to

683
00:38:07,220 --> 00:38:10,120
have questions about this. So I put in another slide of their explanation of

684
00:38:10,120 --> 00:38:13,020
what the S word is. So I hope you all are ready to have this conversation.

685
00:38:13,380 --> 00:38:17,420
let's get the next slide. You don't have to brainstorm your head to figure out

686
00:38:17,420 --> 00:38:20,300
you don't have to brainstorm your head. I didn't read that to figure out what to

687
00:38:20,300 --> 00:38:24,620
talk about with a guy all the time for starter men can and will always be

688
00:38:24,620 --> 00:38:29,700
interested in conversation topics related to sex. However, you need to have

689
00:38:29,700 --> 00:38:34,220
a way with it. Don't just shoot a million sex related questions or topics on him

690
00:38:34,220 --> 00:38:37,900
for that might throw him off the conversation entirely. I've shot a

691
00:38:37,900 --> 00:38:42,100
million sex related something before probably we are already in a we're

692
00:38:42,140 --> 00:38:45,920
We're starting already. We're deep in it. In my, in jizz. So would you guys

693
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:50,720
rather be deep when you're having sex? Would you go deep or not deep? Would

694
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:51,420
you rather get

695
00:38:51,420 --> 00:38:56,480
deep throated or just the tip in your mouth? Just the tip in the mouth? Yeah,

696
00:38:56,480 --> 00:38:57,300
or in their mouth.

697
00:38:57,300 --> 00:39:01,460
Or the butt? Do you like, would you rather... Would you rather do a butt or

698
00:39:01,460 --> 00:39:05,140
a pussy better? Yeah. Or would you rather have a butt or a pussy? Would

699
00:39:05,140 --> 00:39:08,580
you rather... Oh, well, I already have a butt. Oh, gay.

700
00:39:09,700 --> 00:39:12,900
So wait, so I replace my butthole with a pussy?

701
00:39:12,900 --> 00:39:13,900
If you can only have one.

702
00:39:13,900 --> 00:39:17,780
Would you rather go fast or go slow?

703
00:39:17,780 --> 00:39:20,180
I like going as fast as fucking possible.

704
00:39:20,180 --> 00:39:21,180
Yeah.

705
00:39:21,180 --> 00:39:22,180
Yeah.

706
00:39:22,180 --> 00:39:23,180
Yeah.

707
00:39:23,180 --> 00:39:24,180
Yeah.

708
00:39:24,180 --> 00:39:25,500
When I nut it sounds like a fucking turtle.

709
00:39:25,500 --> 00:39:26,500
Do you guys like finishing?

710
00:39:26,500 --> 00:39:27,500
No.

711
00:39:27,500 --> 00:39:28,500
I, yes.

712
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:29,500
That's the only part I like.

713
00:39:29,500 --> 00:39:31,220
Because I want to go all night long.

714
00:39:31,220 --> 00:39:33,540
I wish I could finish fucking instantly.

715
00:39:33,540 --> 00:39:35,260
I wish I could finish ten thousand times in a row.

716
00:39:35,260 --> 00:39:37,700
I wish I could start at the end.

717
00:39:37,700 --> 00:39:41,200
One three, everyone do your O face. One, two, three.

718
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:49,760
I said earlier, I said earlier, I said earlier, it's because I nut like a

719
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:54,560
turtle. You do speedy. I go, do you guys like being on your tummy or on

720
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:59,380
your back? I like being on my back, but as long as I get flipped over,

721
00:39:59,380 --> 00:40:02,460
as long as I get flipped over onto my tummy later.

722
00:40:02,460 --> 00:40:05,840
I like being on my tummy personally.

723
00:40:05,840 --> 00:40:11,940
Do you guys where do you guys like shooting jizz probably in the air big

724
00:40:11,940 --> 00:40:12,480
floor?

725
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:19,180
I shoot it up yeah, the air to the floor yeah, I did give it a busy year curve.

726
00:40:19,180 --> 00:40:23,640
So is that how you say that busy? I have no idea be easy. I say on about I

727
00:40:23,640 --> 00:40:27,880
guess I read it as a year and a bee's ear. We are that's not what we're here

728
00:40:27,880 --> 00:40:29,440
to talk about. No, I'm saying the

729
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:34,660
introducing a new topic to kind of an angle to tackle sex from would you guys

730
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:37,420
photoshop a sexual photo of yourself. I already have

731
00:40:37,420 --> 00:40:44,380
and what would it be? I gave myself boobs for real. I keep putting my face

732
00:40:44,380 --> 00:40:49,680
in it on Lana Rhoades body with Ai yeah, just fucking throwing the videos away

733
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:53,320
yeah, I don't even open them. I do it and I just move it right trash.

734
00:40:53,320 --> 00:40:55,280
You

735
00:40:55,280 --> 00:41:00,180
burn them out to your just to train the Ai on it a little bit, so that yeah

736
00:41:00,180 --> 00:41:03,720
somebody I use that picture might appear. So I'm hoping I get some kind of

737
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:07,400
my cloud hack or something and somebody finds it opens up. I don't want to see

738
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:11,120
you never empty the trash can. You have it all burn. You burn it out to a DVD

739
00:41:11,120 --> 00:41:14,460
and then on your honeymoon, you show your wife like I got you this. I'm doing

740
00:41:14,460 --> 00:41:18,480
I'm just putting all this shit in my I'm putting all this in my recycling bin and

741
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:22,360
then I'm just watching like the most shitty illegal hockey streams of all

742
00:41:22,360 --> 00:41:27,720
time. So I got a nice kind of malware thing that downloads it all. Yeah, but

743
00:41:27,720 --> 00:41:28,700
hopefully soon

744
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:35,560
that on a TV. I got you something special. Pulling out the DVD player, putting it in.

745
00:41:35,560 --> 00:41:39,960
Also, I made a custom menu with bonus features.

746
00:41:39,960 --> 00:41:44,080
There's an Easter egg on it. Yeah, give me your wife's sex tape where you made

747
00:41:44,080 --> 00:41:49,840
a DVD menu with bonus features, scene selection, but the scene selection is

748
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:51,160
all like, it's like,

749
00:41:51,160 --> 00:41:54,480
"I got tired, I needed a break." Yeah,

750
00:41:54,480 --> 00:42:00,240
the scene selection is just like, it's ripped directly from the Crank Yankers

751
00:42:00,240 --> 00:42:06,800
DVD. Yeah, it's got special ed and stuff. Hello, that's perfect. Yeah, it has a

752
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:09,920
DVD run game. Yeah, put it in your computer and you can go on to choose

753
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:12,880
your own adventure. And there's behind the scenes footage of you getting

754
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:14,280
interviewed by like your friend,

755
00:42:14,280 --> 00:42:18,620
like the Star Wars documentary. And you're talking, you're going like, so

756
00:42:18,620 --> 00:42:22,720
basically, you have a completely different... Essentially, I need a duck

757
00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:26,920
for... I set out to make the most erotic film in the registry. It's playing that

758
00:42:26,920 --> 00:42:31,420
I thought what better than a porno to elicit erotic feelings.

759
00:42:31,420 --> 00:42:32,420
Elicit, huh.

760
00:42:32,420 --> 00:42:37,920
Basically I thought to myself, what if I commed at the end of the movie.

761
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:41,420
Or you could do a bunch of different characters in the documentary.

762
00:42:41,420 --> 00:42:44,420
Oh yeah, and the new characters are the ones getting effed.

763
00:42:44,420 --> 00:42:45,420
You're the boom operator.

764
00:42:45,420 --> 00:42:51,920
Yeah, that's what I would do is I would do cross cutting of the sex scene and then like a little behind the scenes thing of me holding the boom.

765
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:53,920
And like, "Wow, they're really going at it."

766
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:55,920
Yeah, they're giving it to me.

767
00:42:55,920 --> 00:43:03,620
damn those five guys are giving it to me. Yeah, I'm going to Craig's posting an

768
00:43:03,620 --> 00:43:07,420
ad for a boom operator for a sex tape with your and I'm not telling her

769
00:43:07,420 --> 00:43:13,720
little like lower third one of those things, but it's like Chuck on him and

770
00:43:13,720 --> 00:43:18,220
on NBC. It's like check out Chuck on Mondays. You're about to say MSNBC.

771
00:43:18,220 --> 00:43:23,520
Well, there is Chuck on there too. Yeah, yeah, Chuck from from thank God for not

772
00:43:23,520 --> 00:43:29,680
that one up. Chuck from what's the show called? Meet the Press. So fuck you buddy. Nowadays

773
00:43:29,680 --> 00:43:34,360
when I watch the one I want to watch the news instead of Meet the Press I think Me Depressed.

774
00:43:34,360 --> 00:43:41,360
Shit. Speaking of brainstorm. That deserves a... Why is brain people say brainstorm like

775
00:43:41,360 --> 00:43:45,320
it's a good thing it sounds painful. Yeah. I think that's our cue to move on to the next

776
00:43:45,320 --> 00:43:48,200
slide. Imagine a squishy brain hitting you in the head. No I was going to say... Number

777
00:43:48,200 --> 00:43:52,740
seven what's his idea of a perfect date? So this is about our friendship. Well yeah but

778
00:43:52,740 --> 00:43:55,580
But it's like friends can talk about what their ideal perfect date would be.

779
00:43:55,580 --> 00:44:00,380
I think I started before the list saying what my perfect date was.

780
00:44:00,380 --> 00:44:01,860
See that's why I was trying to stop you.

781
00:44:01,860 --> 00:44:02,860
Yeah.

782
00:44:02,860 --> 00:44:03,860
That's why I didn't really want you to say that.

783
00:44:03,860 --> 00:44:06,700
Oh my God Cameron, I should listen to you more.

784
00:44:06,700 --> 00:44:10,700
And see we're getting, I'm pretty sure there's a slide in here about communication that's

785
00:44:10,700 --> 00:44:11,700
probably going to pop up.

786
00:44:11,700 --> 00:44:14,540
I think these are all about communication.

787
00:44:14,540 --> 00:44:15,980
That sounded like a fart through the headphones.

788
00:44:15,980 --> 00:44:19,300
Mine is probably a movie, sex and cuddles marathon.

789
00:44:19,300 --> 00:44:20,820
24 hours.

790
00:44:20,820 --> 00:44:22,720
I just do the cuddles marathon.

791
00:44:22,720 --> 00:44:26,520
you guys. I want to have sex. Why do we always need a movie to have a marathon?

792
00:44:26,520 --> 00:44:29,960
Yep. That's always a fucking marathon and not just a couch marathon

793
00:44:29,960 --> 00:44:34,860
or a hanging out all day marathon or a food marathon. Food marathon. Yeah,

794
00:44:34,860 --> 00:44:39,560
food marathon. That would be dope. Yep. A mara, a normal marathon is a food

795
00:44:39,560 --> 00:44:42,520
marathon. When you're done. Yeah. You gotta eat as much as you can. Oh my

796
00:44:42,520 --> 00:44:46,520
God. That replenish. I want to eat all my food. So that's your, that's your

797
00:44:46,520 --> 00:44:50,320
perfect date. Cameron, what's yours? Mine would probably be going to first.

798
00:44:50,320 --> 00:44:56,320
I would fly to Mexico, then I might fly to Monter. Well, no, no, no, no, no. Just to,

799
00:44:56,320 --> 00:45:01,120
I want to, just to like more beautiful part than wherever he is. I would like go to the

800
00:45:01,120 --> 00:45:04,760
beach. I don't think, you don't live near the beach, right? Yeah, no, I'm not coming

801
00:45:04,760 --> 00:45:09,840
anywhere near you. He's not going to say where, but he lives in northeast Mexico. I would

802
00:45:09,840 --> 00:45:13,800
have been, I would be going to the Yucatan Peninsula. Then I'd probably go to Japan.

803
00:45:13,800 --> 00:45:18,560
Yeah. Then probably, I'm with my friends with Yucatan. Iceland, New Zealand. I would do the

804
00:45:18,560 --> 00:45:24,560
Lord of the Rings film tour in New Zealand. Then I would fly to Vegas and I would be like

805
00:45:24,560 --> 00:45:28,600
we'd see the thing where you can get married in Vegas and I'd be like "uh?" and she'd be

806
00:45:28,600 --> 00:45:33,560
like "no, no." And I'd be like "yeah, it's too soon." And then we'd probably fly to Alaska

807
00:45:33,560 --> 00:45:39,960
and then Arctica. Go to Alaska, work on a ship for a couple years. Greenland. Catch snow crab.

808
00:45:39,960 --> 00:45:44,000
I think then we would go to Siberia. I'm kind of like a cold weather winter guy. Yeah, you

809
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:48,600
like so I'd be going and then I go to Ukraine. Yeah, so save that shit. Yeah,

810
00:45:48,600 --> 00:45:53,000
you know you could do go to Las Vegas, go to that. Well, yeah, exactly. Then we

811
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:57,800
go back to Vegas place in Vegas. That looks like Italy right leave immediately

812
00:45:57,800 --> 00:46:02,600
get on a plane, fly to that exact location that they're ripping off in

813
00:46:02,600 --> 00:46:07,680
Italy. Yeah, and then that's actually genius. Then you can compare and

814
00:46:07,680 --> 00:46:11,360
contrast. So then I do that. I do what you just said. Then I fly to Portland,

815
00:46:11,640 --> 00:46:16,320
get kind of our weird on a little bit. I go to Maine and then Oregon, then I'm

816
00:46:16,320 --> 00:46:19,440
taking a bus from Portland to Seattle, then fly. Once we get into Seattle,

817
00:46:19,440 --> 00:46:22,520
we're gonna get to the airport, we're gonna fly from SeaTac. We're gonna fly

the list. The mindful recommends our top to pick up dating sites, a harmony dot

846
00:48:22,740 --> 00:48:25,860
com. I think I don't know who the mindful is. It doesn't say it anywhere

847
00:48:25,900 --> 00:48:30,900
looks on the page. Scary, the mindful to my kind of a villainous name.

848

850
00:48:39,160 --> 00:48:41,960

851
00:48:41,960 --> 00:48:46,400

860
00:49:10,400 --> 00:49:12,400
-And me, I'm licking my lips at a completely different--

861
00:49:12,400 --> 00:49:14,400
-I'm looking at all that hair. -It's under that hair.

862
00:49:14,400 --> 00:49:17,200
-No, just the hair. You're giving me the hair.

863
00:49:17,200 --> 00:49:22,440
wasn't it. I wouldn't want to have sex with the bunny very much. You wouldn't

864
00:49:22,440 --> 00:49:26,400
just I guess if I was a bunny, I would go after a bunny, but even as a bunny

865
00:49:26,400 --> 00:49:30,640
bill, it looks like a human. Yeah, she's kind of is in that spot. If you're a

866
00:49:30,640 --> 00:49:35,800
bunny like to up to a bunny that just the most just normal rabbit is what you

867
00:49:35,800 --> 00:49:40,400
want to just be a bunny, but I guess if you were also, I guess the only person

868
00:49:40,400 --> 00:49:44,520
in the world would be bugs. Yeah, bugs is they're a perfect fit or bugs is

869
00:49:44,560 --> 00:49:48,140
uncle. How can she ever squander him? Imagine how awkward it would be if you're at a party

870
00:49:48,140 --> 00:49:53,100
and you're Bugs Bunny and you're kind of, you're trawling, you're looking for the ladies,

871
00:49:53,100 --> 00:49:57,420
it's all human ladies. Trying to get a peen team. And nobody will even look at you because

872
00:49:57,420 --> 00:50:01,900
you're a disgusting bunny man. And then you turn a corner and it's Lola Bunny right there.

873
00:50:01,900 --> 00:50:05,140
And you're like, I feel with Halle Berry. And she's got her butt pulled out. And you're

874
00:50:05,140 --> 00:50:09,600
just like, well I guess this is the only person in the world. I think that's the worst part

875
00:50:09,600 --> 00:50:14,300
about Lola Bunny is she's got a big tuft of hair right next to her junk. Most girls do.

876
00:50:14,300 --> 00:50:17,860
those girls do these days. No on the back, though. Yeah, they got can't even

877
00:50:17,860 --> 00:50:22,100
beat it from the back because it's got hair. Every girl in America now has

878
00:50:22,100 --> 00:50:27,780
twice as much armpit hair as me and intersecting unibrow, one going this way,

879
00:50:27,780 --> 00:50:31,980
one going down their face. They have sideburns, they have mustaches, they have

880
00:50:31,980 --> 00:50:35,180
hair on their back in places that only dad should have it. Hair on their fingers.

Hair on their, yeah, they have hairy knuckles. It's like girl, girl, it's like

888
00:51:11,860 --> 00:51:15,060
going to say it. I'm not going to tell you. Boil your hair. You should be boiling your hair.

889
00:51:15,060 --> 00:51:19,180
Boil your fucking hair. Boil that hair. You're combing your hair. You're brushing your hair.

890
00:51:19,180 --> 00:51:22,060
You're washing your hair. What the hell are you doing? You're washing it in the hot water.

891
00:51:22,060 --> 00:51:27,580
Not hot enough. Boil that shit. Boil that hair. Boil it! Put that pot on. Step backwards.

892
00:51:27,580 --> 00:51:35,820
Go like that. Yep. Put all your hair in an eight quart pot. Boil it. I know you want to

893
00:51:35,820 --> 00:51:39,660
make lobster later, but you can clean the pot. It's noodles girl, but you don't

894
00:51:39,660 --> 00:51:40,620
know. Okay, next slide.

895
00:51:40,620 --> 00:51:45,160
Ask him about his favorite thing about a woman, probably the pussy in the butt,

896
00:51:45,160 --> 00:51:49,640
the boobs. Okay, I'm going to say the opposite. They're clothes

897
00:51:49,640 --> 00:51:58,300
and their high heels and their makeup and their hair and their clothes and the

898
00:51:58,300 --> 00:52:02,960
way that glasses, you know, where the clothes I have on yeah for me, it's

899
00:52:02,980 --> 00:52:08,180
probably the eyes. Yeah and the teeth yeah. When they're around your cock,

900
00:52:08,180 --> 00:52:13,020
oh my God, I love when the board job got a tooth in it. Yeah, I love when

901
00:52:13,020 --> 00:52:15,940
she got that one to all right, long in the front.

902
00:52:15,940 --> 00:52:20,940
Tell them about your plans. We did this kind of already to for today. We're

903
00:52:20,940 --> 00:52:23,660
just talking about going to the roller coaster. I guess my plan is I'm going

904
00:52:23,660 --> 00:52:25,260
to go home and then I'm going to go eat.

905
00:52:25,260 --> 00:52:31,700
Yeah, we can I say one last thing that's explicit in nature. You have one more

906
00:52:31,740 --> 00:52:34,240
explicit go ahead. Yeah.

907
00:52:34,240 --> 00:52:40,040
I love when a girl got that one front tooth that's way too long

908
00:52:40,040 --> 00:52:44,040
and she shaves your shit down like it's a baby carrot.

909
00:52:44,040 --> 00:52:48,940
That's not how they shave baby carrots. They put them in a

910
00:52:48,940 --> 00:52:49,840
tumbler. And she's doing this, she's going

911
00:52:49,840 --> 00:52:54,940
That's a Bugs Bunny, another Bugs Bunny thing.

912
00:52:54,940 --> 00:52:58,940
She looks like Bugs Bunny. You interrupted the plans to tell

913
00:52:58,940 --> 00:53:00,740
that. You liked it.

914
00:53:01,040 --> 00:53:05,440
I did because of the friendship relationship day, but I would be

915
00:53:05,440 --> 00:53:08,920
getting you. You'd be getting me? Yeah, I'd be throating you right now.

916
00:53:08,920 --> 00:53:12,360
You would, if you throat me, you better have that one long tooth in the front.

917
00:53:12,360 --> 00:53:17,240
I don't want that. It doesn't exist. Absurdist humor, is that what we've

918
00:53:17,240 --> 00:53:18,120
come down to?

919
00:53:18,120 --> 00:53:23,200
I guess it does seem that way. We've never been absurd. We've been years of

920
00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:28,480
this and now we're turning into absurdist nonsense, googly moogly. What

921
00:53:28,480 --> 00:53:32,440
What the hell are you? I'll admit it. I've been on. We should go back to puns. I've been

922
00:53:32,440 --> 00:53:38,700
on one today and I'm sorry and I miss you. I apologize before before a girl sucks my

923
00:53:38,700 --> 00:53:43,160
dick. I make her hold a raw egg in her mouth to prove she can hold it without breaking it.

924
00:53:43,160 --> 00:53:48,600
That's right. That's right. What's funny? Where's the pun in that? I'm just thinking

925
00:53:48,600 --> 00:53:54,080
about things. I'm just thinking about sexual. I thought you were like teeing that up. And

926
00:53:54,080 --> 00:53:58,780
and I'm like damn girl use eggs. Yeah, you know there we go and before I have

927
00:53:58,780 --> 00:53:59,220
sex with

928
00:53:59,220 --> 00:54:01,140
and before I have sex with a

929
00:54:01,140 --> 00:54:02,900
woman, I have her

930
00:54:02,900 --> 00:54:05,440
put a bag of flour in her

931
00:54:05,440 --> 00:54:09,200
she can take care of it.

932
00:54:09,200 --> 00:54:13,120
So it's really dry. Yeah, no, no,

933
00:54:13,120 --> 00:54:19,020
so you can make yeah, don't do flour, do cat litter, absorbs it better. Okay, put

934
00:54:19,020 --> 00:54:20,420
cat litter in a woman's ass

935
00:54:21,500 --> 00:54:42,500
to

936
00:54:42,500 --> 00:54:47,660
all the time. If you don't think about it, you don't think about it, but like, there's

945
00:55:24,680 --> 00:55:28,080
stay active, pick up the book and put it back, keep your education active. You

946
00:55:28,080 --> 00:55:29,840
have to go take, you have to like attend

947
00:55:29,840 --> 00:55:34,960
like keynote speakers and stuff or else they take away your library credentials.

948
00:55:34,960 --> 00:55:38,800
You spend all it is, all it is, is putting the book in and taking it out

949
00:55:38,800 --> 00:55:42,080
for someone. No, these days, no, it's a lot. You may gotta make signs that say

950
00:55:42,100 --> 00:55:44,900
all are welcome. That's what the job is these days.

951
00:55:44,900 --> 00:55:47,700
That's not librarian. That should be the arts and crafts counselor.

952
00:55:47,700 --> 00:55:50,900
No. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

953
00:55:50,900 --> 00:55:53,700
All right. They trash your pussy up too and make it bad.

954
00:55:53,700 --> 00:55:57,300
They trash it up. They junk it.

955
00:55:57,300 --> 00:55:58,700
They put an Elmer's glue stick in it.

956
00:55:58,700 --> 00:56:02,300
They make it terrible. Librarians used to be the top in the world for sex.

957
00:56:02,300 --> 00:56:05,100
They used to be. Now it's real estate agents and stepmom.

958
00:56:05,100 --> 00:56:08,300
Librarians used to be so sexy in the 80s.

959
00:56:08,300 --> 00:56:08,900
It was sexy.

960
00:56:08,900 --> 00:56:09,900
The lady from Ghostbusters?

961
00:56:09,900 --> 00:56:15,400
that is literally on average the ugliest job in America is because they all went

962
00:56:15,400 --> 00:56:18,840
in thinking this is gonna. I would rather have sex with the lunch lady,

963
00:56:18,840 --> 00:56:21,940
but it's always librarian lunch. Like what?

964
00:56:21,940 --> 00:56:26,100
Adam Sandler, I would rather have sex with a lunch lady from that from

965
00:56:26,100 --> 00:56:27,140
prison.

966
00:56:27,140 --> 00:56:33,540
She's a fine too. I think the reason I think I think the reason that librarians

967
00:56:33,540 --> 00:56:39,740
got less hot is because since the 80s now we have homeless people. Yeah,

968
00:56:39,820 --> 00:56:44,100
come into libraries and they I think maybe it's Ronald Reagan's fault. I

969
00:56:44,100 --> 00:56:49,580
think that is the librarians they have don't even bother putting effort into

970
00:56:49,580 --> 00:56:51,540
their appearance because they're like I'm going to walk in. I'm going to be

971
00:56:51,540 --> 00:56:54,820
next to some guy who's wearing a tunic anyway. Exactly. You used to walk into

972
00:56:54,820 --> 00:56:58,620
the library and right there in front of you Marilyn Monroe. Pretty much. Yeah.

973
00:56:58,620 --> 00:57:03,020
Nowadays you walk in the library a book about Marilyn Monroe. A scary weirdo.

974
00:57:03,020 --> 00:57:06,580
And a woman hiding behind it. And a woman hiding behind the book because guess

975
00:57:06,580 --> 00:57:08,580
That's what you walked into the library with six guns again.

976
00:57:08,580 --> 00:57:12,740
I think Ghostbusters ruined it by scaring everyone who was going to be a librarian.

977
00:57:12,740 --> 00:57:13,740
They did.

978
00:57:13,740 --> 00:57:20,180
I used to be able to walk in and start immediately chatting up the lady behind the library lady.

979
00:57:20,180 --> 00:57:22,180
Now you go up and say, "Excuse me, little guy.

980
00:57:22,180 --> 00:57:23,580
Are you looking for your parents?"

981
00:57:23,580 --> 00:57:31,500
Because they all look like Damien from The Omen.

982
00:57:31,500 --> 00:57:33,180
Number 25, don't forget social media.

983
00:57:33,180 --> 00:57:35,500
You definitely want to know his social media behavior.

984
00:57:35,500 --> 00:57:38,740
Some of the great conversation stars for this topic are which social media

985
00:57:38,740 --> 00:57:42,260
platforms he is active on which one does he prefer the most? What is so likeable

986
00:57:42,260 --> 00:57:47,580
about imagine you go on the most amazing day ever right like like a guy has taken

987
00:57:47,580 --> 00:57:52,100
it me. Imagine I'm taking you out. We have an amazing time. It's like maybe

988
00:57:52,100 --> 00:57:56,660
where we go set it up. We're going we'll go to it's mostly a walk and maybe we do

989
00:57:56,660 --> 00:58:00,960
an activity. Maybe we make a terrarium together and then I make I make dinner at

990
00:58:00,960 --> 00:58:03,900
my place, but we're not going to have sex or whatever, but at the end it's your

991
00:58:03,940 --> 00:58:09,300
first time meeting me at the end, you're like, let me get your Instagram. You just

992
00:58:09,300 --> 00:58:14,300
made me imagine all that. I was close to hands free nutting and he's like, I don't

993
00:58:14,300 --> 00:58:17,940
use Instagram. He's like, oh, I'll here, I'll just follow you. Okay, cool. You go

994
00:58:17,940 --> 00:58:22,040
to the bathroom, freshen up, maybe you're gonna have sex, ding, followed by funny

995
00:58:22,040 --> 00:58:22,740
hood clips.

996
00:58:22,740 --> 00:58:26,840
What do you do?

997
00:58:26,840 --> 00:58:29,540
Well, I mean, it shows that

998
00:58:30,340 --> 00:58:34,980
million followers. Well, first of all, it shows I'm giving it up because he's

999
00:58:34,980 --> 00:58:35,540
clouded.

1000
00:58:35,540 --> 00:58:40,540
Of course, that's what I'm saying. You have to, it shows that he maybe I could

1001
00:58:40,540 --> 00:58:43,940
make an account called Mrs Funny Hood Clips and I could get maybe three to

1002
00:58:43,940 --> 00:58:47,340
four million followers. Funny Hood Clips, just being associated with it. Fifth

1003
00:58:47,340 --> 00:58:52,900
account, follow the YouTube, back up. I could run his back up account in case he

1004
00:58:52,900 --> 00:58:57,060
gets banned for posting something with blood in it, that he really shouldn't be

1005
00:58:57,100 --> 00:59:00,820
posting on Instagram. No, no, no, no. And you're like, how did you even get this

1006
00:59:00,820 --> 00:59:04,700
video? Yeah. What is this? It says, this video has never been posted anywhere

1007
00:59:04,700 --> 00:59:07,420
else on the internet. It's fucking Funky Town.

1008
00:59:07,420 --> 00:59:12,300
And you're just like, "Alright, I guess it's a funny hood clip, I don't know."

1009
00:59:12,300 --> 00:59:16,900
Yeah, funny hood clips and it's all just other women who kind of look a little

1010
00:59:16,900 --> 00:59:21,500
bit like you. Yeah. Being the victim of CCTV crimes on the same block.

1011
00:59:21,500 --> 00:59:26,020
What if you... Okay, now what about this? Now look at nowadays, what about

1012
00:59:26,020 --> 00:59:28,980
something like this. You say, okay, let me follow you on Instagram. He says, oh, I

1013
00:59:28,980 --> 00:59:31,620
don't use Instagram. You're like, okay, what can I follow you on? And he says,

1014
00:59:31,620 --> 00:59:37,180
here's the QR code to my Etsy store. Damn, I would say he makes earrings out

1015
00:59:37,180 --> 00:59:40,860
of clay. I don't have Instagram. I do like this one. I still have vine.

1016
00:59:40,860 --> 00:59:45,540
He's on Google+. It never left my phone.

1017
00:59:45,540 --> 00:59:49,340
Yeah, you can follow me on Google Buzz. Okay, next.

1018
00:59:49,340 --> 00:59:53,780
Religion and faith. While imagining your future with somebody, you will want them

1019
00:59:53,780 --> 00:59:56,940
to share the same beliefs as you. Here comes the knowledge about his

1020
00:59:56,940 --> 01:00:00,020
religious beliefs. You will like to know if the person you are talking to

1021
01:00:00,020 --> 01:00:03,500
believes in God or not. If he does, does he spend much time worshipping God?

1022
01:00:03,500 --> 01:00:07,500
Discuss if he thinks all religions are similar. Try to know what he has to say

1023
01:00:07,500 --> 01:00:12,180
regarding communal problems. Don't get into a debate. Try to keep it subtle.

1024
01:00:12,180 --> 01:00:15,540
Every religion doesn't even have one single fucking thing in common. No,

1025
01:00:15,540 --> 01:00:19,100
they're completely different. Probably chains. And I'm bloody agnostic.

1026
01:00:19,620 --> 01:00:24,180
probably a chain slash mindful slash head. Although I think I will I do think

1027
01:00:24,180 --> 01:00:28,420
most religions, I think are unique and and and beautiful and all and all this

1028
01:00:28,420 --> 01:00:33,360
type of thing, but I think that I've noticed a lot of similarities between

1029
01:00:33,360 --> 01:00:35,340
Buddhism and Satanism.

1030
01:00:35,340 --> 01:00:41,420
I got I got I got there both pure evil. Definitely. I got turned to be high

1031
01:00:41,420 --> 01:00:43,740
because of Dwight Schrute. Yeah, yeah.

1032
01:00:43,740 --> 01:00:49,460
I got turned to Shinto because I like the word Shinto. Yeah, I honestly thought

1033
01:00:49,460 --> 01:00:53,340
that was food until right now. Me too. You know what it was? You're thinking shishito

1034
01:00:53,340 --> 01:01:01,340
peppers. I'm thinking a bento box. Well guess what's in my bento box? I barely have room

1035
01:01:01,340 --> 01:01:06,340
for one language. I'm actually going to be the first ever guy to be into Norse mythology

1036
01:01:06,340 --> 01:01:12,860
and believe in Viking gods and not be racist. I'm going to make it woke. I'm going to

1037
01:01:12,860 --> 01:01:16,740
woke-ify the white nationalist religion. You will do it for two weeks and then you will

1038
01:01:16,740 --> 01:01:20,780
be on fire. You do it, you're going to try and woke up by the white nationalist. I'm

1039
01:01:20,780 --> 01:01:23,380
going to turn them. I'm going to set them right. You're going to make like they are

1040
01:01:23,380 --> 01:01:27,380
like Filipino or something and someone's going to fire. You know, there is evidence

1041
01:01:27,380 --> 01:01:32,420
that Thor was Filipino. I see. That's a sad thing. I think that probably is the one true

1042
01:01:32,420 --> 01:01:39,500
religion is that Thor does exist. Yeah. Why would we have lightning? Exactly. You know

1043
01:01:39,500 --> 01:01:42,900
that most of those guys just got it all. They got it all twisted. You know, it's crazy about

1044
01:01:42,900 --> 01:01:46,880
that stuff is they most of that is just they never wrote it down and then all

1045
01:01:46,880 --> 01:01:50,160
the Christian people came and just made like changed everything so we don't know

1046
01:01:50,160 --> 01:01:53,540
what any of the original stuff was it's all just Thor might have been for a

1047
01:01:53,540 --> 01:01:57,800
little bit look like Juvia he could be Thor what if all the north stuff that

1048
01:01:57,800 --> 01:02:02,100
wasn't written down just said like be excellent my dudes yeah I think

1049
01:02:02,100 --> 01:02:07,340
basically well it did that's my theory be excellent my dude what if it just

1050
01:02:07,340 --> 01:02:11,940
said that be tough I'm gonna be the first atheist to go to heaven yeah cuz

1051
01:02:11,940 --> 01:02:17,640
because you final moment you're like no, just kidding. No, no, I will be so I

1052
01:02:17,640 --> 01:02:21,080
think Stephen Hawking already went to heaven. Yeah, he was an atheist. Well,

1053
01:02:21,080 --> 01:02:23,360
he went there built a machine to tell him what himself

1054
01:02:23,360 --> 01:02:28,120
they're like. I don't know what to do with you. Now you didn't put it back in

1055
01:02:28,120 --> 01:02:30,920
hell. I just teleport right back. He didn't believe in any of that atheist

1056
01:02:30,920 --> 01:02:34,900
crap. That was just his computer talking for him. Yeah, he literally was like

1057
01:02:34,900 --> 01:02:39,260
he was trying to type it. I believe in God. I love the science is heresy. What

1058
01:02:39,300 --> 01:02:43,180
yeah, what the all this stuff that I have quote unquote discovered as we're

1059
01:02:43,180 --> 01:02:46,280
trying to miss leave you into darkness and the computers like translating

1060
01:02:46,280 --> 01:02:49,100
translating. I love science. God is not real.

1061
01:02:49,100 --> 01:02:54,100
I am a heathen and proud of it yeah and he didn't cheat either. By the way, I

1062
01:02:54,100 --> 01:02:56,920
love the computer. That was the computer to yeah, the

1063
01:02:56,920 --> 01:03:03,620
hey baby yeah, he's not responsible. Do you want to fuck this guy? I mean me

1064
01:03:03,620 --> 01:03:04,820
fuck this going

1065
01:03:05,740 --> 01:03:10,240
No, no, no, all right, what's next here? Try to dig deep and discuss fears

1066
01:03:10,240 --> 01:03:14,100
while you enjoy talking. Take a sneak peek into the person's darker version.

1067
01:03:14,100 --> 01:03:18,960
Once he is comfortable with you, ask him if he has any phobias. What I know his

1068
01:03:18,960 --> 01:03:20,000
phobia is shouting

1069
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:25,160
not my phobia. You have a shouting. I don't I don't like I'm

1070
01:03:25,160 --> 01:03:26,900
I have

1071
01:03:26,900 --> 01:03:29,880
got me. So you have a phobia.

1072
01:03:29,880 --> 01:03:33,800
I've gotten over that, but I have a phobia. I got scared of it

1073
01:03:34,960 --> 01:03:39,600
two nights ago. I have a phobia of marijuana. Yeah, me too. Yeah, I got

1074
01:03:39,600 --> 01:03:44,600
close. I came close to sinning. I didn't even it came out the other night at the

1075
01:03:44,600 --> 01:03:47,960
it was I know I was standing in a circle and next thing I knew it was next to me.

1076
01:03:47,960 --> 01:03:51,400
I didn't believe I didn't even Caleb Jubilee at the shindig. I didn't even

1077
01:03:51,400 --> 01:03:54,480
know it was there until I turned it's right next to me. The smoke is puffing

1078
01:03:54,480 --> 01:03:58,600
out. I'm thinking to myself, you know, I could yeah, what's going to happen bro.

1079
01:03:58,600 --> 01:04:03,640
If I ever took a hit of weed, it would be such a problem. It'd be so like if

1080
01:04:03,640 --> 01:04:07,080
we're all hanging out, somebody passed me a joint and I think, "This will be funny."

1081
01:04:07,080 --> 01:04:08,800
I remember when you used to smoke weed all the time.

1082
01:04:08,800 --> 01:04:09,800
Dude, that was the thing.

1083
01:04:09,800 --> 01:04:11,440
I used to smoke weed constantly.

1084
01:04:11,440 --> 01:04:17,640
You'd come to my house and it would literally look like a movie version of what a stoner

1085
01:04:17,640 --> 01:04:18,640
does.

1086
01:04:18,640 --> 01:04:25,320
You'd come to my house, there'd be chips everywhere, multiple bags, and I'd just be playing the

1087
01:04:25,320 --> 01:04:26,600
Switch on my TV.

1088
01:04:26,600 --> 01:04:31,960
I think that was basically every day until your most recent apartment also.

1089
01:04:31,960 --> 01:04:32,960
It's true.

1090
01:04:32,960 --> 01:04:36,260
Yeah, I didn't smoke the thing the thing for me that the reason that the thing

1091
01:04:36,260 --> 01:04:39,300
that stopped me from doing it in that big circle of people is I was saying

1092
01:04:39,300 --> 01:04:42,800
like so I haven't smoked weed in like two years right, but also I haven't

1093
01:04:42,800 --> 01:04:46,560
smoked weed around another human being and probably like four years. Yeah,

1094
01:04:46,560 --> 01:04:51,540
no, that's not there's no area. There's no green. Yeah, yeah, yeah, oh my god.

1095
01:04:51,540 --> 01:04:55,580
One time he smoked weed and he turned completely green. Yeah, he greened out.

1096
01:04:55,580 --> 01:04:58,260
I let my power show it was

1097
01:04:59,520 --> 01:05:01,720
It was actually the craziest thing I've ever seen.

1098
01:05:01,720 --> 01:05:02,720
Was that in college?

1099
01:05:02,720 --> 01:05:03,720
Yeah.

1100
01:05:03,720 --> 01:05:04,720
I've never seen somebody turn green.

1101
01:05:04,720 --> 01:05:05,720
I was there.

1102
01:05:05,720 --> 01:05:06,720
That was the night I drank 30 beers.

1103
01:05:06,720 --> 01:05:09,120
That was one of the first times that I hung out with that group of people too.

1104
01:05:09,120 --> 01:05:10,120
Yeah, at my apartment.

1105
01:05:10,120 --> 01:05:11,120
Yeah.

1106
01:05:11,120 --> 01:05:12,120
You turn green and then you sat down for a little while.

1107
01:05:12,120 --> 01:05:13,120
Basically passed out.

1108
01:05:13,120 --> 01:05:14,120
And then you were fine.

1109
01:05:14,120 --> 01:05:18,120
That was the night, it was like the first couple of weeks that I had known you guys

1110
01:05:18,120 --> 01:05:21,280
and I showed up with a 30 rack and drank like 15 of them.

1111
01:05:21,280 --> 01:05:22,760
I think it was the medicine I was on.

1112
01:05:22,760 --> 01:05:25,000
Oh yeah, this is, these are all here to share.

1113
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:26,240
You were on a greener.

1114
01:05:26,240 --> 01:05:27,240
I was on a greener.

1115
01:05:27,240 --> 01:05:28,240
Yeah.

1116
01:05:28,240 --> 01:05:29,240
Was the pill green?

1117
01:05:29,240 --> 01:05:32,500
I showed my power, though it really scared me. All right, although you all

1118
01:05:32,500 --> 01:05:34,440
don't know I'm a hero called the chameleon, you

1119
01:05:34,440 --> 01:05:40,440
the comedian you're making me laugh with that shit and we go right to

1120
01:05:40,440 --> 01:05:44,620
trigger funny conversations, which we have covered thanks to me,

1121
01:05:44,620 --> 01:05:49,160
but we don't have to do this one. Let's go to the next one, because we do have

1122
01:05:49,160 --> 01:05:53,560
this unlock and this is the last one. Don't demand extravagant things like a

1123
01:05:53,560 --> 01:05:58,120
like and that is a picture of a car. Can I just have a napkin? Don't demand

1124
01:05:58,160 --> 01:06:02,500
extravagant things. Patrick, you need to chill. I thought that was a demanding

1125
01:06:02,500 --> 01:06:07,720
extravagant. No, okay, then can I have a tissue paper from that's even more

1126
01:06:07,720 --> 01:06:15,040
extravagant from a present? I don't know. Can you? May I please have a diamond

1127
01:06:15,040 --> 01:06:16,640
hanky? I don't know. May you

1128
01:06:16,640 --> 01:06:24,640
a diamond hanky? What's a hanky made of diamonds? Chain mail, mithril, mithril,

1129
01:06:24,660 --> 01:06:30,820
Mithril. Gilded Mithril. Mithril Henke. They don't gild Mithril. In RuneScape they do. They

1130
01:06:30,820 --> 01:06:37,320
do? Yeah. That's bullshit. Mithril and Adamant. He's adamant that they don't do that. They

1131
01:06:37,320 --> 01:06:45,420
gild it, you put a trim. That's dumb. You a bitch. If we were in the dueling arena I

1132
01:06:45,420 --> 01:06:49,380
would beat the shit out of you right now. You would not beat the shit out of your friend.

1133
01:06:49,380 --> 01:06:52,840
Good luck beating the shit out of the chameleon. I've been crawling up the wall, changing the

1134
01:06:52,840 --> 01:06:59,840
the color of the wall. Look at how sticky his hand is. I will eat Mo. Don't eat Mo. He's

1135
01:06:59,840 --> 01:07:05,200
just ruined his thing. Don't eat Mo. Did you keep his nuts? No, I wish. That would have

1136
01:07:05,200 --> 01:07:07,040
been funny. You didn't? You really should have. You should have eaten him. That would

1137
01:07:07,040 --> 01:07:10,880
have been funny. I would have loved to have had him sat down and just eaten him. Yeah,

1138
01:07:10,880 --> 01:07:16,040
Mo's nuts in a jar right there, that would have been funny. That is not funny. That is

1139
01:07:16,040 --> 01:07:21,480
gruesome. It would have been funny if we did an episode where we were scientists. How do

1140
01:07:21,480 --> 01:07:24,200
How do you not think of that stuff?

1141
01:07:24,200 --> 01:07:25,840
Because I'm an artist, not a scientist.

1142
01:07:25,840 --> 01:07:27,400
Yeah, but scientists...

1143
01:07:27,400 --> 01:07:29,080
I can make art out of anything.

1144
01:07:29,080 --> 01:07:30,640
Artists can parody scientists.

1145
01:07:30,640 --> 01:07:34,360
He's going to poke it through the bottom.

1146
01:07:34,360 --> 01:07:35,360
Coffee pop.

1147
01:07:35,360 --> 01:07:36,360
You're an inventor, not an artist.

1148
01:07:36,360 --> 01:07:37,360
That's an invention, you idiot.

1149
01:07:37,360 --> 01:07:38,360
Oh, god damn it, it's science!

1150
01:07:38,360 --> 01:07:39,360
Fuck, no!

1151
01:07:39,360 --> 01:07:40,360
Don't throw that at Cameron.

1152
01:07:40,360 --> 01:07:41,360
You squirted him.

1153
01:07:41,360 --> 01:07:42,360
Look at him, he's rubbed a squirt off.

1154
01:07:42,360 --> 01:07:43,360
My shirt turned orange and brown.

1155
01:07:43,360 --> 01:07:44,360
And my hat turned completely brown with coffee.

1156
01:07:44,360 --> 01:07:45,360
I'm not always in.

1157
01:07:45,360 --> 01:07:46,360
I'm not always in.

1158
01:07:46,360 --> 01:07:47,360
I'm not always in.

1159
01:07:47,360 --> 01:07:48,360
I'm not always in.

1160
01:07:48,360 --> 01:07:49,360
I'm not always in.

1161
01:07:49,360 --> 01:07:50,360
I'm not always in.

1162
01:07:50,360 --> 01:07:51,360
I'm not always in.

1163
01:07:51,360 --> 01:07:56,360
again. This is all white brown. Look at the splotch you made this black splotch

1164
01:07:56,360 --> 01:08:02,720
of coffee. Pop was coffee. Pop coffee. Pop coffee. Pop flop coffee. Pop was not

1165
01:08:02,720 --> 01:08:07,400
a flop. Coffee pop was a flop. Oh, the bus is here. The bus is here. We gotta

1166
01:08:07,400 --> 01:08:07,720
go.

1167
01:08:07,720 --> 01:08:12,040
Bye guys. Get the hell out of here. Oh wait. Do we promote that? No, we don't

1168
01:08:12,040 --> 01:08:13,080
have that. Okay, whatever

1169
01:08:13,080 --> 01:08:20,800
I could go into his room. You could go through. I just had the most incredible

1170
01:08:20,820 --> 01:08:26,520
vision of Patrick in like 10 years from now, teaching like an English 101 course.

1171
01:08:26,520 --> 01:08:31,920
Like a 200 person public university English class and how amazing your lectures would be.

1172
01:08:31,920 --> 01:08:38,220
Yeah. You'd be teaching them funny words. I'd be teaching them how to talk in a style that is...

1173
01:08:38,220 --> 01:08:39,920
What books would you put on the curriculum?

1174
01:08:39,920 --> 01:08:43,720
I know what your first slide would be. A screenshot of a drill tweet.

1175
01:08:43,720 --> 01:08:46,720
Study this.

1176
01:08:46,720 --> 01:08:48,920
A lot of people would say this isn't English.

1177
01:08:48,920 --> 01:08:51,560
This class is about the study of brevity.

1178
01:08:51,560 --> 01:08:52,720
This is a text.

1179
01:08:52,720 --> 01:08:53,720
You would say that.

1180
01:08:53,720 --> 01:08:54,720
Say this is text.

1181
01:08:54,720 --> 01:08:55,720
Yeah.

1182
01:08:55,720 --> 01:08:56,720
This is text.

1183
01:08:56,720 --> 01:08:57,720
This is photos.

1184
01:08:57,720 --> 01:09:03,280
Yeah, teaching an English class and showing photos.

1185
01:09:03,280 --> 01:09:04,280
This is a photo.

1186
01:09:04,280 --> 01:09:05,280
Photos.

1187
01:09:05,280 --> 01:09:06,960
Learn how to look at these.

1188
01:09:06,960 --> 01:09:09,680
You think that texts, look at this line of text.

1189
01:09:09,680 --> 01:09:10,680
Thinking that they don't know.

1190
01:09:10,680 --> 01:09:11,680
Look at this line of text.

1191
01:09:11,680 --> 01:09:12,680
Six words.

1192
01:09:12,680 --> 01:09:14,400
Look at this photo that accompanies it.

1193
01:09:14,400 --> 01:09:16,600
One thousand and six words.

1194
01:09:16,600 --> 01:09:18,360
You would be such an amazing teacher.

1195
01:09:18,360 --> 01:09:20,600
I wish there was more professors like you in this world.

1196
01:09:20,600 --> 01:09:24,520
I'd be such a good teacher for people with adult ADHD.

1197
01:09:24,520 --> 01:09:26,000
No, normal people.

1198
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:27,000
Normal people?

1199
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:28,000
Good people?

1200
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:29,000
Completely normal people.

1201
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:30,480
I could teach the syllabus one line.

1202
01:09:30,480 --> 01:09:31,480
I wish I could...

1203
01:09:31,480 --> 01:09:32,480
Fuck it.

1204
01:09:32,480 --> 01:09:34,240
Fuck the bullshit.

1205
01:09:34,240 --> 01:09:36,400
I wish I could go back in time and make you older than me.

1206
01:09:36,400 --> 01:09:37,880
I want to look up to you so bad.

1207
01:09:37,880 --> 01:09:39,880
I want to look up to you in every way.

1208
01:09:39,880 --> 01:09:42,440
And I want you to teach me everything that you've ever learned.

1209
01:09:42,440 --> 01:09:45,800
I showed him my penis and now he's being very kind to me.

1210
01:09:45,800 --> 01:09:47,480
And I want to look up at it.

1211
01:09:47,480 --> 01:09:51,420
I see you different being very, very yeah. I think you don't realize, but you

1212
01:09:51,420 --> 01:09:54,820
completely changed your relationship with us forever. I looked at the cock

1213
01:09:54,820 --> 01:09:59,240
through the cracks in your fingers and now I can't poetry. Oh my God, the

1214
01:09:59,240 --> 01:10:00,000
English teacher,

1215
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:02,920
I brought that down to the cracks in your fingers.

1216
01:10:02,920 --> 01:10:09,420
The most incredible line of poetry I've ever heard someone say say it one more

1217
01:10:09,420 --> 01:10:13,320
time. I peered at your cock through the cracks in your fingers.

1218
01:10:15,360 --> 01:10:16,840
I could listen to that forever.

1219
01:10:16,840 --> 01:10:17,840
Keep going.

1220
01:10:17,840 --> 01:10:19,280
And what I've seen cannot be undone.
