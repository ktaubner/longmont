00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[MUSIC]

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:21,040
I've been the Holiday Sheriff of Brooklyn, Texas for 45 years.

3
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:25,900
Grandfather, father, son, grandson, great grandson, my zygote nephew,

4
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:29,400
Charles Ford, we're all Holiday Sheriffs.

5
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:31,400
Hardly knew what that was then now.

6
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:37,400
But you know, you just know you gotta look after the joy and the sensations of popular traditions, pastimes.

7
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:40,400
Make sure they all occur and go smoothly.

8
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:43,400
We all had a way of doing things.

9
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:49,400
Things we took special care of. Grandpa always cared for the Fourth of July, patriotic type.

10
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:52,400
My Pa always loved the Jew ones, no offense.

11
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:55,400
And my cousin Artie, he loved Christmas.

12
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:57,400
Loves the cookies and the milk.

13
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:01,120
presents and the way those bits of poop

14
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:03,680
dingleberries hang around the hairs of your ass

15
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:06,000
I try to tell him that that ain't a part of Christmas but

16
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,520
[laughter]

17
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:11,280
he don't want to listen to him

18
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:13,760
but he defends it all the same

19
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:16,160
and I'm sure Dallas is better for it

20
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:18,960
sometimes he'll grow a beard for Christmas

21
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:20,160
he'll put little bits of

22
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:22,000
little bits of poo poo in there and he'll say

23
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,200
I'm the Christmas Carol

24
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:27,760
he thinks the Christmas Carol's a guy who has a lot of dried shit hanging around his body

25
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:32,520
That just about confused everybody, but you know, I think he only lost three kids that

26
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:33,520
year.

27
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:36,120
I don't know where they went.

28
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:37,120
I'm getting sidetracked.

29
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:39,400
See, for me it's about Easter.

30
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:44,760
Rebirth, I like the eggs, hell I like peeps alright.

31
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:50,160
Springtime, something new, and you need something new because when you look down the barrel of

32
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:54,400
Good Friday, if you're not thinking that there's something on the other side, some kind of rebirth,

33
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:56,280
well, I don't know.

34
00:01:56,280 --> 00:02:00,280
Maybe it ain't worth it. It's all we got.

35
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:02,280
We pan...

36
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:04,280
It's a good toffee.

37
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:07,280
It's perfect. Perfect Cormac McCarthy.

38
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:12,280
And we pan, along, thank you, to the desert.

39
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:15,280
The El Desierto, or the desert.

40
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:17,280
Where there are three eggs.

41
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:18,280
In Brooklyn, Texas.

42
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:21,280
Three of known repute who've made their mark.

43
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:22,280
Different forms.

44
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:27,280
They're hunters, and today they've tracked a herd of beagles into the desert.

45
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:32,000
For them, it's maybe just another day meant to pass the time beneath the unending fire

46
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,560
of the lone star's sun.

47
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:37,280
But little do they know, their lives are about to change forever.

48
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:38,280
Hmm?

49
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:40,840
Oh, they don't know that.

50
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:41,840
Little do they know.

51
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:42,840
Okay.

52
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:43,840
They know a little of it.

53
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:44,840
They know a little bit of it.

54
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:50,920
Who are these eggs on this fine, good Friday?

55
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:52,440
Remember me?

56
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:55,680
It's me, Yolkman, the memorable egg.

57
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:58,560
You probably used to watch my show when you were a kid.

58
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:00,400
Practically everybody did.

59
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:02,120
I'm Yolkman, the egg.

60
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:05,680
Come on, I know you remember me from Yolkman's world.

61
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:07,800
Remember my egg body?

62
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:10,400
Remember my cute little arms and legs

63
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:13,600
with the white gloves and the black platform boots?

64
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:16,080
Remember the floppy appendage between my legs

65
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:17,880
that the North American localization

66
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:20,200
desperately tried to claim was a tail?

67
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:22,200
I know you remember me, I'm Yolkman!

68
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:24,800
Remember my doorman, Mr. Loopy?

69
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:27,200
He's one of the funniest characters for sure.

70
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:28,400
Well, he's dead.

71
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:29,500
But remember him?

72
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:33,300
Remember my nemesis, the nefarious Dr. Mingala?

73
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:34,400
Remember the-

74
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:35,900
[laughter]

75
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:39,000
Remember the banned episode where he teamed up with Freddy Krueger?

76
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Remember my toy line?

77
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Remember Yolkman's surprise eggs?

78
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:48,600
Remember how many children were hospitalized for choking, lead poisoning, seizures, and suicidal ideation?

79
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:49,400
I do.

80
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:54,940
zero and remember me yoke man from my world. Remember your favorite episode of

81
00:03:54,940 --> 00:03:59,480
yoke man's world. That was my favorite episode to unless yours is yoke man goes

82
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:03,880
to jail or the yoke man family court debacle or yoke man teams up with

83
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:08,520
doctor. It's not important. What's important is that you remember me the

84
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:11,700
memorable egg from yoke man's world yoke man

85
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:14,100
yoke man. The

86
00:04:16,940 --> 00:04:20,780
from yorkman's world. You guys remember him yeah yorkens. I think I've seen

87
00:04:20,780 --> 00:04:23,840
maybe thirty or forty episodes of you yeah, it's a lot of it's like two

88
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:26,700
hundred seasons somewhere between thirty or forty. I think I've seen a

89
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:30,760
lot of that world actually the more I think about this world. Yeah, I think

90
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:35,400
it's like one of the most viewed worlds for me of world. Yeah, yeah, so

91
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:38,860
you open a memorable egg. You have a tackle move.

92
00:04:38,860 --> 00:04:41,920
I just thought that would be good

93
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:45,260
And then also I gave you yolk shot.

94
00:04:45,260 --> 00:04:46,260
Mm-hmm.

95
00:04:46,260 --> 00:04:47,260
From the show, yeah.

96
00:04:47,260 --> 00:04:48,260
Yeah, from the show.

97
00:04:48,260 --> 00:04:49,260
We all know yolk shot.

98
00:04:49,260 --> 00:04:50,260
Yeah, from the world.

99
00:04:50,260 --> 00:04:52,860
Right, sorry, yeah.

100
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:54,700
When you do that, it marks a target.

101
00:04:54,700 --> 00:04:56,740
So it sort of does like a fairy fire kind of move.

102
00:04:56,740 --> 00:04:57,740
Yeah, of course, yeah.

103
00:04:57,740 --> 00:05:02,700
You get advantage, which in the show, Yolkman would always announce that he has advantage

104
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:03,700
on attacks.

105
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:04,700
It's like fairy fire.

106
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:05,700
Yeah, that's what he would say.

107
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:06,700
Yeah, he had to take the yolk button.

108
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:11,060
But yeah, we have another egg out hunting.

109
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:12,740
Who is this second egg?

110
00:05:12,740 --> 00:05:14,740
[Squeaky laughter]

111
00:05:14,740 --> 00:05:16,740
Oh no.

112
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:18,740
[Squeaky laughter]

113
00:05:18,740 --> 00:05:20,740
It's the century egg.

114
00:05:20,740 --> 00:05:22,740
[Squeaky laughter]

115
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:24,740
What?

116
00:05:24,740 --> 00:05:26,740
[Squeaky laughter]

117
00:05:26,740 --> 00:05:28,740
[Squeaky laughter]

118
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:30,740
[Squeaky laughter]

119
00:05:30,740 --> 00:05:34,740
I needed to go to Rostress for less.

120
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:36,740
[Squeaky laughter]

121
00:05:36,740 --> 00:05:38,740
I need to go today.

122
00:05:38,740 --> 00:05:41,740
I need to go to Rostress for less right now.

123
00:05:41,740 --> 00:05:56,980
now my shoes are hurting me I need to buy new orthopedics oh there surely is no

124
00:05:56,980 --> 00:06:10,980
country for me anymore I'm dying I'm constantly sick they put a video of me

125
00:06:10,980 --> 00:06:22,980
on tick-tock and my skin look like beef jerky. Oh I remember so many people in my

126
00:06:22,980 --> 00:06:27,860
life but they don't remember me anymore.

127
00:06:27,860 --> 00:06:36,060
Oh there were two Thebes here. I hurt all the time. And you really went with both of them.

128
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:43,660
which was old man I guess and eggs so you're the century egg one of the oldest

129
00:06:43,660 --> 00:06:52,860
eggs in Brooklyn Texas you one of century egg there might be a millennial like saw

130
00:06:52,860 --> 00:07:05,980
slavery happen and I did nothing so you have a few moves defender egg which you

131
00:07:05,980 --> 00:07:11,660
you can you can protect your fellow eggs reducing damage you have five uses per

132
00:07:11,660 --> 00:07:16,980
long rest of that and then urine because as we all know and even though Wikipedia

133
00:07:16,980 --> 00:07:22,740
said it was it was just a popular myth well yeah it's bullshit century eggs are

134
00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:26,940
marinated in horse urine for a hundred years you're thinking of a virgin boy egg

135
00:07:26,940 --> 00:07:28,940
that's marinated in virgin boys urine. I've never thought of a virgin boy egg.

136
00:07:28,940 --> 00:07:32,460
Maybe I should have been that character. Well I spend a lot of time thinking about

137
00:07:32,460 --> 00:07:36,300
a virgin boy a virgin boy eggs I've never thought of this the other one's

138
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:40,740
combination of probably spent like that's I probably spent like 36 hours of

139
00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:44,820
waking time thinking about virgin boy eggs good for you you know I'm not gonna

140
00:07:44,820 --> 00:07:49,540
say if that's good or bad I feel like it's a trap for me um yeah so you have

141
00:07:49,540 --> 00:07:52,980
an ability to sort of a let urine come out of your body and create sort of a

142
00:07:52,980 --> 00:08:00,640
puddle that's an ability that's just a mistake I have that ability it is up to

143
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:10,920
15 feet around I'm using my ability and then you have egg foo old century egg

144
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:17,020
all right and then we have a third egg you're all by the way using the exact

145
00:08:17,020 --> 00:08:22,000
same hunting rifle pointing it at the herd of beagles okay and what's this

146
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:29,340
third egg we have here um T Dumpty sat on a wall empty dumpty had a great fall

147
00:08:29,340 --> 00:08:36,340
all. Umpty Dumpty wasn't so umpty. Wumpty? We've all heard the stories. I feel like 30

148
00:08:36,340 --> 00:08:42,340
stories. It wasn't bloody gory, just yolks and whites are pouring. These days I live

149
00:08:42,340 --> 00:08:47,740
in Texas, on the hunt for girls to have sex with. But this old washed up breakfast got

150
00:08:47,740 --> 00:08:56,740
stood up in the desert. I was supposed to meet a slut named Amy. In the desert.

151
00:08:56,740 --> 00:09:07,700
desert. Cool, we got Hupty Dupty. You have a few abilities. DIY! You've got Great Fall.

152
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:13,460
So when you use Great Fall, you can jump upwards of 30 feet high, but only so that you can

153
00:09:13,460 --> 00:09:19,900
fall. So you can't just jump up 30 feet and land on something. You deal 1d10 damage plus

154
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:25,260
1d6 for every 10 feet from which you fall to an enemy. So it's a huge attack. Afterwards

155
00:09:25,260 --> 00:09:32,580
you enter cracked mode. When you're cracked mode, you can, you have a ranged attack instead

156
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:38,500
where you can sling eggshell shards at people. If you do great fall again when you're in cracked

157
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:41,180
mode, that's when you actually take fall damage.

158
00:09:41,180 --> 00:09:43,820
Okay, so I get one freebie.

159
00:09:43,820 --> 00:09:48,420
You get one freebie and then you gotta wait for three rounds and then cracked mode will

160
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:50,740
reset. You'll put yourself together again.

161
00:09:50,740 --> 00:09:51,740
Okay.

162
00:09:51,740 --> 00:09:52,740
As the story goes.

163
00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:53,740
Cool.

164
00:09:53,740 --> 00:09:57,300
And then you have a regular melee attack called Whack.

165
00:09:57,300 --> 00:09:58,300
Okay.

166
00:09:58,300 --> 00:10:01,100
So, you guys are hunting a herd of beagles.

167
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:06,020
You see them sort of out in the desert, El Deserito.

168
00:10:06,020 --> 00:10:08,900
And yeah, I mean, you guys want to try to take a shot?

169
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:11,620
Like what's your beagle hunting sort of strategy?

170
00:10:11,620 --> 00:10:14,660
Shoot 'em in the brine!

171
00:10:14,660 --> 00:10:17,500
Yeah, well I'm down with that.

172
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:18,500
Okay, cool.

173
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:19,900
Can you just put your mic further away when you do that?

174
00:10:19,900 --> 00:10:23,180
A beagle is licking my head.

175
00:10:23,180 --> 00:10:28,180
Beagle to herd. We should send the old one down as bait.

176
00:10:28,180 --> 00:10:33,980
I kick this entry egg down the cliff and just watch him kind of roll.

177
00:10:33,980 --> 00:10:37,180
Okay. Are you gonna let that happen or you really don't resist?

178
00:10:37,180 --> 00:10:39,180
Got it. Okay.

179
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:41,180
Roll into the pile of beagles.

180
00:10:41,180 --> 00:10:45,180
You roll into the herd of beagles. They sort of like cock their heads to the side.

181
00:10:45,180 --> 00:10:47,180
They're just beagles. They start to like kind of lick you.

182
00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:50,180
I don't care if I live or die.

183
00:10:50,180 --> 00:10:54,980

184
00:10:54,980 --> 00:10:57,700
bit. There's a nibble at you. You guys have a clear shot.

185
00:10:57,700 --> 00:10:59,620
Can we? We can understand beagles.

186
00:10:59,620 --> 00:11:02,020
Do they scooby-doo type?

187
00:11:02,020 --> 00:11:04,100
They start, this one of them is scooby-doo.

188
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:07,540
Can I aim directly at the doo himself?

189
00:11:07,540 --> 00:11:12,260
Yeah, he goes rut-ro as you aim. Okay, roll just a d20 and we'll

00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:18,820
My whole body is not a brains of the dog.

216
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:27,120
I'm sorry century egg and the other Beagle start to scatter

217
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:32,320
and as they do you see them sort of heading in towards the

218
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:35,320
distance and you can get a clear view of what's going on

219
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:37,920
further past where the Beagles are.

220
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:45,600
There seems to be some sort of litany of abandoned trucks, or at least they're just sort of laying

221
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:50,320
in the middle of the field.

222
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:53,160
Actually you, Sentry A, because you're closer, roll...

223
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:57,920
Let's have you roll Perception, because you're probably going to get a better view of this.

224
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:00,800
Because you rolled down the hill.

225
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:02,040
I got a 12.

226
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:03,040
Okay.

227
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:05,240
All right, that's fine.

228
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:06,240
You can probably see it then.

229
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:13,920
So you see not just like the cars down there, but you see eggs look similar to

230
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:17,160
you guys and you see them in different states.

231
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:20,280
Oh my grandson.

232
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:21,280

Those eggs are in Oklahoma.

237
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:28,200
You're all in Texas.

238
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:29,200
We're in North Texas and those eggs are in Oklahoma.

239
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:33,720
So what is it the border of Texas, Oklahoma and.

240
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:34,720
Mexico.

00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:42,060

242
00:13:42,060 --> 00:13:46,360

247
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:09,760
one that's sunny side up on the hood of the car.

248
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:13,760
Um, it's pretty bad. It looks like a pretty bad scene.

249
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:15,760
I wish that was me!

250
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:17,760

256
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:31,760
Well, I'm referring to people in the egg sense.

257
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:35,040
Here's an old egg. That's back when they were called eggs people.

258
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:36,640
They considered people eggs.

259
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:38,640
There's egg pools here.

260
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:40,640
There's dead egg pools.

00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:57,760
You two don't find any magic items here.

353
00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:01,000
That doesn't mean that there aren't magic items in this session, by the way.

354
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,000
Keep looking, boys.

355
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,360
I'm sure you'll find something.

356
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:05,760
It is Easter, of course.

357
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:12,560
I'm gonna keep looking for magic items you with that 20 are able to perfectly trace a

358
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:20,020
Ketchup stain for the omelet or in the scrambled eggs, okay? Yeah, do we bleed ketchup as eggs?

359
00:19:20,020 --> 00:19:25,860
I think we I think we bleed our yolks. Yeah, you guys bleed yolk, okay, but in this case. It's ketchup. Yeah

360
00:19:25,860 --> 00:19:32,200
Yeah, and you can trace it all the way to a tree further in the back

361
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:36,480
like like way far from the scene like somebody who was trying to get away yeah

362
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:42,000
And you see there. It looks like a extremely dead frog

363
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:48,440
Let's go okay his mouth fully

364
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:58,160

00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:19,240
lot of golden babies

370
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:31,400
Remind me why are us three friends?

371
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:35,280
Bachi Club

372
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:39,680
For all ages just trying to remember yeah

373
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:50,200
It was a cruise ship in a sink

374
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:59,400
Yeah, how small are we you guys are regular sized things regular size regular for eggs or regular people?

375
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:03,100
Oh, so we're like huge egg monster. So in the modern world setting of

376
00:21:03,100 --> 00:21:09,420
Our of the pal universe. There are also a race of egg people who are in, Texas

377
00:21:09,420 --> 00:21:17,760
That is what I have had to decide. Hey, I mean so can we just start a new setting called Easter world

378
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:21,960
worlds that we can return to time and time again on different

379
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:22,660
holidays.

380
00:21:22,660 --> 00:21:26,960
Well, there is I also established through this a an

381
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:30,160
idea of a holiday Sheriff and so there's sort of a litany of

382
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:32,460
sheriffs out there who oversee holidays.

383
00:21:32,460 --> 00:21:33,160
Okay, cool.

384
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:35,860
So there's there's lots of there's lots of Lord potential.

385
00:21:35,860 --> 00:21:38,260
I want all the autistic fans taking notes on this.

Yeah. That's facts. And so, as you guys get the eggs, roll a perception, all of you.

391
00:21:52,760 --> 00:22:06,760
Okay, that's a seven. Fourteen. Thirteen. Pretty good. You're too enamored with the golden eggs, I would say,

392
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:14,760
Yoakamon. Century Egg and Humpty Dumpty, you have your wits about you. Somehow, Century Egg, you have your wits

393
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:18,760
about you a little bit more. I've been around the block.

394
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:20,760
That's cool. You changed up the accent a little bit.

395
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:22,760
How did I change the accent?

396
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:24,760
A little more slipping into Cosby here.

397
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:30,760
What do you mean I've not slipped up into anything?

398
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:36,760
Do you have any jello pudding pies?

399
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:38,760
It's very good.

400
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:40,760
You got the cadence down too. It's not just the voice.

401
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:42,760
Okay.

402
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:46,180
You guys get the sense I've got an episode with mr. Cosby

403
00:22:46,180 --> 00:23:11,000
You guys sense the presence of

404
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:22,080
of what? Cosby Surprise Egg. Oh yeah, true. I should have written that in. God damn, I

405
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:27,640
had that on my desk. I could have just written the Cosby Surprise Egg. It was looking right

406
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:37,280
at you the entire time. The cartel. The white Cuban cartel has arrived. What? They're here?

407
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:40,600
Well, you could you two can sense that they're approaching can hear their car

408
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:47,600
Sounds like an Impala with a baby on board sticker

409
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:52,720
Think it might be the white Cubans Oh

410
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:59,160
Dear I can hear the rustling of motorcycle jeans

411
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:11,240
You get the sense that there's a a t-shirt with a daffy duck

412
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:15,920
Approaching at Mach speed

413
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:20,680
They're here

414
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:27,080
Yeah, you see them roll up and you would recognize this you know you guys you know you guys kind of wander into the scene

415
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:32,960
You're not too unfamiliar with the criminal world of the of the desert

416
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:35,600
And you would recognize

417
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:43,120
Domenico van Halen a lieutenant of the white Cubans and he says to you guys

418
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:46,880
Were you guys doing

419
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:52,040
What accent should I choose for this voice for this character? I didn't decide on the way here. You think that's good

420
00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:56,560
No, I think you nailed it. You think I'm like sort of tattling like straddling line there

421
00:24:56,560 --> 00:25:00,280
I I've been facing the other way and I hear that voice. I'm like what?

422
00:25:02,340 --> 00:25:04,340

508
00:29:18,560 --> 00:29:20,560
And he stabs you four.

509
00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:22,560
Me? Nah.

510
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:24,560
Yeah, who's four?

511
00:29:24,560 --> 00:29:26,560
[Laughter]

512
00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:28,560
Fucking genius.

513
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:30,560
For four damage.

514
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:32,560
My sides.

515
00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:34,560
Oh my sides are in orbit right now.

516
00:29:34,560 --> 00:29:36,560
Me for damage?

517
00:29:36,560 --> 00:29:38,560
Me for damage?

518
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:40,560
This reminds me of that episode

519
00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:42,560
Yolkman takes 4 damage.

520
00:29:42,560 --> 00:29:44,560
Oh I don't remember that one.

521
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:48,560
Maybe you saw Yolkman takes 5 damage.

522
00:29:48,560 --> 00:29:50,560
That one was more popular.

523
00:29:50,560 --> 00:29:52,560
AC?

524
00:29:52,560 --> 00:29:54,560
My AC is 14.

525
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:56,560
Okay, your AC?

526
00:29:56,560 --> 00:29:58,560
12. Okay.

527
00:29:58,560 --> 00:30:00,560
You get hit, two others come after you

528
00:30:01,560 --> 00:30:06,620
And they miss they miss you're able to sort of Humpty Dumpty them. I just fall

529
00:30:06,620 --> 00:30:13,120
Yeah, you just fall over and they're like that was a great fall and they miss thanks you get shank old man

530
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:20,820
You have like three HP or you take three damage no he's alright

531
00:30:20,820 --> 00:30:25,580
Whoa what is going on with your your brain in mind right now? I said three and then you said three yeah

532
00:30:25,580 --> 00:30:30,480
No, I mean I had to I rolled it. Yeah mine fucking blown. You're up Humpty Dumpty

533
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:39,120
Um, I guess, I mean, let's start it off pretty cool. Let's start it off pretty cool by me

534
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:40,800
doing my Greatfall ability.

535
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:43,360
Alright, cool.

536
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:45,640
And I want to do the maximum damage.

537
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:46,640
Okay.

538
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:54,400
Yeah, I realize now that also that I like didn't create any incentive for you to not do the

539
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:57,360
maximum damage. I should have done something where it's like if you do the maximum height

540
00:30:57,360 --> 00:30:58,880
it takes longer to come back together.

541
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:01,480
- You introduced the mechanic of it.

542
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:03,240
- But I didn't create any disincentives to that.

543
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:05,480
- You do more damage for the higher up you go,

544
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:06,320
but there's no downside.

545
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:07,160
- There's no downside.

546
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:07,980
- I could jump up one foot and I'm still proud.

547
00:31:07,980 --> 00:31:09,740
- It doesn't take longer to recover

548
00:31:09,740 --> 00:31:11,220
or do more damage going forward.

549
00:31:11,220 --> 00:31:13,760
No, I realized that after the fact, yeah.

550
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:15,160
And that's on me.

551
00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:18,480
And this is part of a learning podcast.

552
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:19,880
So yeah, go for it.

553
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:20,720
- Okay.

554
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:23,520
(high-pitched squeaking)

555
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:25,320
Crit one, failure.

556
00:31:25,320 --> 00:31:27,000
- Really?

557
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:27,820
- Yep.

558
00:31:27,820 --> 00:31:28,820
Or is it a DC?

559
00:31:28,820 --> 00:31:29,820
CritFail.

560
00:31:29,820 --> 00:31:30,820
No, it's not.

561
00:31:30,820 --> 00:31:32,940
Wow, you got a CritFail.

562
00:31:32,940 --> 00:31:37,300
So you jump up 30 feet and you just like go somewhere else?

563
00:31:37,300 --> 00:31:39,300
You just keep going.

564
00:31:39,300 --> 00:31:40,300
Through the skybox.

565
00:31:40,300 --> 00:31:42,300
You just keep going in the area?

566
00:31:42,300 --> 00:31:43,300
Yeah.

567
00:31:43,300 --> 00:31:44,300
I'm just suspended in the sky.

568
00:31:44,300 --> 00:31:49,220
You clip through the skybox and reload in this area when the system sort of realizes

569
00:31:49,220 --> 00:31:52,900
that like, oh, the model is sort of out of frame and we got to reload it.

570
00:31:52,900 --> 00:31:54,940
More reality is broken.

571
00:31:54,940 --> 00:31:56,420
But you're also shattered too.

572
00:31:56,420 --> 00:31:59,820
So you're still in, you're still in, uh, uh, crap mode.

573
00:31:59,820 --> 00:32:00,820
Nate's sacked!

574
00:32:00,820 --> 00:32:01,820
Okay.

575
00:32:01,820 --> 00:32:04,140
Uh, SentryEgg, you're up.

576
00:32:04,140 --> 00:32:05,940
How many people are around me?

577
00:32:05,940 --> 00:32:08,780
Uh, well, uh, only one went after you.

578
00:32:08,780 --> 00:32:09,780
Two went after him.

579
00:32:09,780 --> 00:32:12,820
So there's only one right in front of you, but all of them are kind of around you-ish.

580
00:32:12,820 --> 00:32:14,180
What'd you say there?

581
00:32:14,180 --> 00:32:18,260
Did you say that they're, um, 15 feet around me?

582
00:32:18,260 --> 00:32:19,260
Uh, yes.

583
00:32:19,260 --> 00:32:20,260
Uh, yes.

584
00:32:20,260 --> 00:32:22,620
Well, I'm, I just, I don't know what to do.

585
00:32:22,620 --> 00:32:23,620
I'm an old man.

586
00:32:23,620 --> 00:32:24,620
You start peeing.

587
00:32:24,620 --> 00:32:30,460
I just, I'm sitting here and I'm just, "Oh no! Oh dear!"

588
00:32:30,460 --> 00:32:33,020
And I just pee all over the ground.

589
00:32:33,020 --> 00:32:36,060
That's right, your horse urine leaking out of your body.

590
00:32:36,060 --> 00:32:39,340
I didn't mean to do this, I swear!

591
00:32:39,340 --> 00:32:41,340
Okay.

592
00:32:41,340 --> 00:32:44,620
Oh, heavens.

593
00:32:44,620 --> 00:32:46,620
Play it as it lies.

594
00:32:46,620 --> 00:32:48,620
That is a six.

595
00:32:48,620 --> 00:32:50,620
Oh my god.

596
00:32:50,620 --> 00:32:52,620
Domenico. Domenico got a crit. Okay.

597
00:32:52,620 --> 00:32:58,220
everybody did very poorly except for the main guy so they all the three guys who

598
00:32:58,220 --> 00:33:01,300
are around like as you're peeing your horse pees like leaks out of your body

599
00:33:01,300 --> 00:33:09,020
they all go whoa wait is that an attack it's not it's a it's a it's a Domenico

600
00:33:09,020 --> 00:33:13,980
is marked just saying oh no cuz it's a saving throw thing you know it's not

601
00:33:13,980 --> 00:33:19,420
just saying but Domenico is marked so if you do an attack roll on him was it me

602
00:33:19,420 --> 00:33:22,380
you get advantage which actually that's what i should have asked you

603
00:33:22,380 --> 00:33:25,220
who are you targeting specifically dominico

604
00:33:25,220 --> 00:33:25,980
don't say to me

605
00:33:25,980 --> 00:33:27,660

606
00:33:27,660 --> 00:33:28,420
you can see them

607
00:33:28,420 --> 00:33:31,460
you'll say to me that it was a little while ago and i think i think i think i

608
00:33:31,460 --> 00:33:32,620

609
00:33:32,620 --> 00:33:35,820
noted that it was after him ago i'm gonna be real i was going after the guys

610
00:33:35,820 --> 00:33:36,780

611
00:33:36,780 --> 00:33:40,740

uh...

617
00:33:52,460 --> 00:33:54,780
and you did

618
00:33:54,780 --> 00:33:58,940
you did five damage to both of them and they're knock prone

619
00:33:58,940 --> 00:34:03,300
uh... all three of the guys are knock prone except for Domenico

620
00:34:03,300 --> 00:34:05,260
uh... so that's pretty good

621
00:34:05,260 --> 00:34:07,980
damn so you guys all have advantage on them

622
00:34:07,980 --> 00:34:10,300

[Laughter]

653

00:35:40,620 --> 00:35:42,620
[Laughter]

656
00:35:42,620 --> 00:35:44,620
This is like that one episode.

657
00:35:44,620 --> 00:35:46,620
What's the one? I don't remember.

658
00:35:46,620 --> 00:35:48,620
Oh, you saw the...

659
00:35:48,620 --> 00:35:50,620
Oh...

660
00:35:50,620 --> 00:35:52,620
I thought I scrubbed that one.

661
00:35:52,620 --> 00:35:54,620
The collaboration with Vivid Media.

662
00:35:54,620 --> 00:35:58,620
I poked my head out of the RV

663
00:35:58,620 --> 00:36:01,260
RV and I see the penis and the nose and I go...

664
00:36:01,260 --> 00:36:10,580
Here come your peas, boy.

665
00:36:10,580 --> 00:36:16,420
As you're beating these guys down and it's their turn now and suddenly Domenico perks

666
00:36:16,420 --> 00:36:21,740
up and he goes, "El Conejo."

667
00:36:21,740 --> 00:36:26,380
And he looks around and all of his guys go, "El Conejo."

668
00:36:27,380 --> 00:36:32,140
We'll be back. We'll be back. We'll fuck you guys up and they all start to run away

669
00:36:32,140 --> 00:36:39,380
Sex with us there in mail

670
00:36:39,380 --> 00:36:45,760
Up and down and all which ways there you know I think I'm gonna stay right here

671
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:51,380
There in melee range of you guys wait in various capacities, so you can

672
00:36:52,980 --> 00:36:58,140
roll for an opportunity. I'm like I'm spinning around and using my I'm

673
00:36:58,140 --> 00:37:02,060
slapping him in the face with my dick. Okay, yeah, Domenico is pretty low right

674
00:37:02,060 --> 00:37:06,980
now and I have advantage, but that's a 22. I assume that roll. See if you get

675
00:37:06,980 --> 00:37:10,940
crit. Okay, now it's not crit. Yeah, roll for damage

676
00:37:10,940 --> 00:37:12,940
to

677
00:37:12,940 --> 00:37:18,100
man. You didn't kill him. You slap him. But can you have a big dick shaped

678
00:37:20,100 --> 00:37:27,100

679

789
00:42:59,700 --> 00:43:01,300
- This is strange.

790
00:43:01,300 --> 00:43:02,740
- Eggsy now.

791
00:43:02,740 --> 00:43:04,900
- How come all of our buildings are shaped

792
00:43:04,900 --> 00:43:06,220
like giant versions of us?

793
00:43:06,220 --> 00:43:07,940
I just started thinking about that.

794
00:43:07,940 --> 00:43:09,940
- Kind of obvious, yeah?

795
00:43:09,940 --> 00:43:11,340

797
00:43:12,180 --> 00:43:14,380
- With the money you have is eggs,

798
00:43:14,380 --> 00:43:17,220
so the buildings are also eggs, you're also eggs.

799
00:43:17,220 --> 00:43:18,860
- Why couldn't it just be a building?

800
00:43:18,860 --> 00:43:19,700
- Yeah, so the guitar--

801
00:43:19,700 --> 00:43:22,180

The spin? What do you mean? What do you mean? We're going to, you know,

853
00:46:02,480 --> 00:46:06,160
the odds, have you fixing this against us? It's just based on, yeah, wait,

854
00:46:06,160 --> 00:46:08,640
I don't even want to roll. I mean, he sounds like he's, yeah,

855
00:46:08,640 --> 00:46:11,400
it's 50 50 odds on a roulette table. Okay. You got to give me 20,

856
00:46:11,400 --> 00:46:16,280
20 50 odds on a roulette 20s or 19s. I get twenties.

857
00:46:16,480 --> 00:46:18,840
i when i get nineteen cells the one

858
00:46:18,840 --> 00:46:20,380
that's fine yeah

859
00:46:20,380 --> 00:46:24,960
or what it's like a freezer for a small but fifteen to twenty

860
00:46:24,960 --> 00:46:29,540
okay doubles of fifty are done i think this is very unfair mine's gotta be

861
00:46:29,540 --> 00:46:32,280
anything over eleven i went

862
00:46:32,280 --> 00:46:35,880
and i think i think that is your own point and i'm calling a lot of our

863
00:46:35,880 --> 00:46:39,040
immediate to things over eleven

864
00:46:39,040 --> 00:46:40,000
zero to win

865
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:41,960
i think that's fair on the slot

866
00:46:41,960 --> 00:46:46,200
Mm-hmm two things do they have to be doubles so to win two things over 11 to

867
00:46:46,200 --> 00:46:49,500
rolls over 11 before two rolls under 11. Yeah, you know

868
00:46:49,500 --> 00:46:55,040
Nice track. That's good, though. No two rolls over a lot of like in one roll

869
00:46:55,040 --> 00:46:58,620
Okay, so if I just go it's good though if I get two numbers

870
00:46:58,620 --> 00:47:06,040
This is a gambler. What's up two numbers over 11? Yeah, sure two numbers over 11

871
00:47:06,040 --> 00:47:11,800
Yeah, two numbers over a look. I'm rolling. I win the slut 14 14. Okay, that's over 11

872
00:47:11,800 --> 00:47:13,800
That's over 11 by my count.

873
00:47:13,800 --> 00:47:15,800
Alright, roll the dice.

874
00:47:15,800 --> 00:47:16,800
And 12.

875
00:47:16,800 --> 00:47:18,800
Okay, yeah, you win that one. That's okay.

876
00:47:18,800 --> 00:47:20,800
So he doubles his eggs?

877
00:47:20,800 --> 00:47:22,800
He doubles his golden eggs.

878
00:47:22,800 --> 00:47:24,800
Okay, I'm spinning the slot.

879
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:26,800
Okay, so one of them.

880
00:47:26,800 --> 00:47:28,800
You've lost all your golden eggs.

881
00:47:28,800 --> 00:47:30,800
That's okay, I made up the losses.

882
00:47:30,800 --> 00:47:32,800
He did make up the losses.

883
00:47:32,800 --> 00:47:34,800
I'll spin it. I'm out of luck.

884
00:47:34,800 --> 00:47:36,800
I'm through. I didn't win on this spin, so I'm going to win on the next one.

885
00:47:36,800 --> 00:47:38,800
It's gonna juice!

886
00:47:38,800 --> 00:47:40,800
It's a juicy magusa.

887
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:42,160
It's a juice or a mcgristle, come on.

888
00:47:42,160 --> 00:47:42,880
You promise?

889
00:47:42,880 --> 00:47:44,080
Yeah, come on, hand it over.

890
00:47:44,080 --> 00:47:44,960
You promise?

891
00:47:44,960 --> 00:47:46,000
Alright.

892
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:47,120
I had him at half the ice.

893
00:47:47,120 --> 00:47:47,760
I promise.

894
00:47:47,760 --> 00:47:48,260
Sure.

895
00:47:48,260 --> 00:47:50,800
Okay, I lost again.

896
00:47:50,800 --> 00:47:52,640
Give me the other, come on.

897
00:47:52,640 --> 00:47:55,440
Believe in him, he's gonna juice!

898
00:47:55,440 --> 00:47:59,600
I mean, he lost toys in a red one until he loses three toys in a red.

899
00:47:59,600 --> 00:48:00,480
I'm gonna win, come on.

900
00:48:00,480 --> 00:48:02,160
You gotta believe in him!

901
00:48:02,160 --> 00:48:02,880
Oh, here they are.

902
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:04,960
By the power of Christ!

903
00:48:04,960 --> 00:48:05,920
Uh, I lost again.

904
00:48:05,920 --> 00:48:07,520
Well, I'm all out of--

905
00:48:07,520 --> 00:48:08,880
Come on, give me the rest, give me the rest.

906
00:48:08,880 --> 00:48:10,240
The rest I think, and he's--

907
00:48:10,240 --> 00:48:12,240
Alright, I believe in you!

908
00:48:12,240 --> 00:48:14,240
I'm seriously due.

909
00:48:14,240 --> 00:48:16,240
I'm gonna give you my eggs!

910
00:48:16,240 --> 00:48:18,240
Okay, I'm spinning.

911
00:48:18,240 --> 00:48:20,240
Okay, I lost a bet.

912
00:48:20,240 --> 00:48:22,240
(Laughter)

913
00:48:22,240 --> 00:48:24,240
Well, no money.

914
00:48:24,240 --> 00:48:26,240
At least we got...

915
00:48:26,240 --> 00:48:28,240
I guess we have to plan a robbery!

916
00:48:28,240 --> 00:48:30,240
(Laughter)

917
00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:32,240
I think we need to rob the casino now.

918
00:48:32,240 --> 00:48:34,240
That'd be an amazing idea!

919
00:48:34,240 --> 00:48:36,240
Let's rob the casino!

920
00:48:36,240 --> 00:48:38,240
Let's build together a group.

921
00:48:38,240 --> 00:48:47,200
a group. We need 11 eggs to rob this casino. With different oiconic abilities. I'm getting

922
00:48:47,200 --> 00:48:54,480
a sudden desire to eat in every single scene. I think we should skip to our second house

923
00:48:54,480 --> 00:48:58,800
cause then we'll have 12 eggs and it's a dozen. Yeah that's a good idea. That makes a lot

924
00:48:58,800 --> 00:49:04,360
more sense. Good point. I hope there's never a baker's dozen. I just noticed at the bottom

925
00:49:04,360 --> 00:49:07,840
of this basket there's a blinking transponder looking thing and I'm

926
00:49:07,840 --> 00:49:14,440
hungry so I'm thinking I'm gonna swallow it just so whatever happens next happens

927
00:49:14,440 --> 00:49:20,880
next I don't know there's a piece of paper here it says El Conejo will look

928
00:49:20,880 --> 00:49:26,400
for you no matter what I'm so hungry I'm wrong

929
00:49:26,400 --> 00:49:33,280
you have to remember that El Conejo has principles all right we don't know

930
00:49:33,280 --> 00:49:41,280
that yeah well you will know that soon whoa that was on the intercom okay so

931
00:49:41,280 --> 00:49:44,560
because we spent so much money this case because you know we already have to we

932
00:49:44,560 --> 00:49:48,560
have to be have a comp room right yes you do have a comp I think that's totally

933
00:49:48,560 --> 00:49:51,520
fair so I'm gonna go up listen that would be crazy if they didn't give you

934
00:49:51,520 --> 00:49:57,440
yeah just give them so much fucking yeah I'm gonna go up to my to my room it's

936
00:50:02,120 --> 00:50:04,120
Well, I'm the only one who played.

937
00:50:04,120 --> 00:50:06,120
Nuh-uh, I did roulette.

938
00:50:06,120 --> 00:50:10,120
You did one of a third of a bunch of money.

939
00:50:10,120 --> 00:50:12,120
They don't want you to win though.

940
00:50:12,120 --> 00:50:14,120
We share a room. We're sharing a room.

941
00:50:14,120 --> 00:50:16,120
I'm in my red dress.

942
00:50:16,120 --> 00:50:18,120
I gave you all my money.

943
00:50:18,120 --> 00:50:22,120
I'm in my red dress at the bar and I'm looking for the wealthiest looking man in the world.

944
00:50:22,120 --> 00:50:24,120
Okay, where are you two at?

945
00:50:24,120 --> 00:50:26,120
We're in our room watching TV.

946
00:50:26,120 --> 00:50:28,120
Yeah, we have our shoes off.

947
00:50:28,120 --> 00:50:30,120
I'm flipping through the channels.

948
00:50:30,120 --> 00:50:31,120
Finding Yoakman.

949
00:50:31,120 --> 00:50:33,000
I know they have it.

950
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:34,000
They have to have it.

951
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:35,000
You're at the bar.

952
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:36,800
I'm starting to think you never had a TV show.

953
00:50:36,800 --> 00:50:39,800
Can I roll to see if they have Yoakman's World?

954
00:50:39,800 --> 00:50:42,680
Uh, let's roll Investigation, yeah.

955
00:50:42,680 --> 00:50:43,680
Okay.

956
00:50:43,680 --> 00:50:45,440
Flipping the channels is Investigation.

957
00:50:45,440 --> 00:50:46,440
I'm down with that.

958
00:50:46,440 --> 00:50:47,440
Ooh, that's fun.

959
00:50:47,440 --> 00:50:48,440

We gotta get the fuck out of here.

00:50:55,320 --> 00:50:56,320
It's a free room.

964
00:50:56,320 --> 00:50:57,320

You see a...

980
00:51:58,800 --> 00:51:59,800
No, that's like the worst strategy ever.

981
00:51:59,800 --> 00:52:00,800
I hope they do, yeah.

982
00:52:00,800 --> 00:52:01,800
You're going to attract some guys like fucking no one...

983
00:52:01,800 --> 00:52:02,800
You're attracting rich rapists.

984
00:52:02,800 --> 00:52:03,800
Yeah.

985
00:52:03,800 --> 00:52:04,800
That's a horrible technique.

00:52:04,800 --> 00:52:11,520
I hope I don't get fucked.

987
00:52:11,520 --> 00:52:14,240
I'm attracting them for the lawsuit money.

988
00:52:14,240 --> 00:52:15,240
Oh, okay.

989
00:52:15,240 --> 00:52:16,240
All right.

990
00:52:16,240 --> 00:52:20,600
I'm not going to try to interrogate that.

991
00:52:20,600 --> 00:52:23,600
Um, yeah, you see a, uh, uh...

992
00:52:23,600 --> 00:52:26,600
"I hope nobody fucks me."

993
00:52:26,600 --> 00:52:31,600
"Oh, I hope nobody takes me to dinner and then has sex with me!"

994
00:52:31,600 --> 00:52:34,600
"A man can earn money!"

995
00:52:34,600 --> 00:52:36,600
He's a man, but he looks...

996
00:52:36,600 --> 00:52:38,600
He's got a peculiar haircut.

997
00:52:38,600 --> 00:52:41,600
And he looks at you and he says,

998
00:52:41,600 --> 00:52:43,600
"I don't want to fuck you."

999
00:52:43,600 --> 00:52:46,600
"I don't want to fuck you either, you look like a mushroom."

1000
00:52:46,600 --> 00:52:53,000
*laughing*

1001
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:55,000
Oh, is that so?

1002
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:57,000
Look at you!

1003
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:58,000
I have not looked at myself.

1004
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:00,000
Dusty-ass old bitch!

1005
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:02,000
I'm 100 years old!

1006
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:05,000
Congratulations.

1007
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:09,000
Whoa! You have a shiny pin on your lapel!

1008
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:11,000
What is that?

1009
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:13,000
It's something I got for being a good-

1010
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:15,000
It's four lines!

1011
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:17,000
intersecting

1012
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:19,000
do you know

1013
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:21,000
and it's red and black

1014
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:23,000
with white on it

1015
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:25,000

1016
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:27,000

00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:29,000
(laughing)

1018
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:31,000
what the hell? why are you wearing that?

1019
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:33,000
I guess this is Texas

1020
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:35,000
and there's a lot of them here

1021
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:37,000

1022
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:39,000
huh?

1023
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:41,000
when Christ

1024
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:43,000
rose from the dead

1025
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:45,000
I'm so old.

1026
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:47,000
100 years later.

1027
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:50,000
And he hands you a D20.

1028
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:51,000
Uh huh.

1029
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:52,000
Whoa.

1030
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:53,000
And he says.

1031
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:54,000
Damn.

1032
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:55,000
Nerd.

1033
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:56,000
Why I heard that?

1034
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:57,000
Nerd.

1035
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:58,000
He says.

1036
00:53:58,000 --> 00:53:59,000
Did you bring this?

1037
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:00,000
Oh I think it's a nerd game.

1038
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:02,000
Did you bring this color D20 specifically for this?

1039
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:03,000
Damn.

1040
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:04,000
So sick dude.

1041
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:05,000
Roll the dice.

1042
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:06,000
Roll the dice?

1043
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:07,000
You're gonna have to.

1044
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:09,000
I don't have any more money to roll the.

1045
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:10,000
Hold on.

1046
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:11,000
Let me go get more chips.

1047
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:12,000
No no you don't need the money.

1048
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:16,280
I need to get more chips. You don't need money. You need to buy me chips before I roll this dice

1049
00:54:16,280 --> 00:54:20,220
You don't ask the bartender for chips. Come on now

1050
00:54:20,220 --> 00:54:29,680
We just can we just get some chips chips and salsa

1051
00:54:29,680 --> 00:54:35,040
Some chips I'm allergic to guacamole

1052
00:54:35,040 --> 00:54:41,580
Okay, and avocado if you don't onions you don't roll this dice

1053
00:54:41,580 --> 00:54:43,580
You're getting me chips!

1054
00:54:43,580 --> 00:54:47,580
I'm not rolling the dice until you get me chips and salsa!

1055
00:54:47,580 --> 00:54:48,580
I'll roll it for you.

1056
00:54:48,580 --> 00:54:49,580
I'll roll it then!

1057
00:54:49,580 --> 00:54:51,580
Please kill us.

1058
00:54:51,580 --> 00:54:56,580
Eleven.

1059
00:54:56,580 --> 00:54:57,580
Okay.

1060
00:54:57,580 --> 00:54:58,580
Do I add anything to that?

1061
00:54:58,580 --> 00:55:00,580
No. Hold on. One second.

1062
00:55:00,580 --> 00:55:04,580
He opens his Dungeon Master's Guide.

1063
00:55:04,580 --> 00:55:05,580
Yes.

1064
00:55:05,580 --> 00:55:07,580
Where's that little book you got there?

1065
00:55:07,580 --> 00:55:08,580
Okay, hold on. So...

1066
00:55:08,580 --> 00:55:09,580
I'm holding.

1067
00:55:09,580 --> 00:55:15,420
holding. Well you have 11, so we're going to divide that by 2. What is that 5.5? What's

1068
00:55:15,420 --> 00:55:28,420
your birthday? Uh, 1. 1, 1. What year is it? Oh, I don't want to say. I feel like I don't

1069
00:55:28,420 --> 00:55:36,620
want to date too much of the modern campaigns. What year is it? It's 2022. Okay, I guess

1070
00:55:36,620 --> 00:55:43,900
1922. Okay, hold on one second. New Year's Day. I was the New Year's baby one year. Do you know what time?

1071
00:55:43,900 --> 00:55:46,660
What time?

1072
00:55:46,660 --> 00:55:55,620
I'm turning it into Unix code. Hold on. It's 836, right?

1073
00:55:55,620 --> 00:55:58,380
What time I was born? Do you know how many seconds?

1074
00:55:58,380 --> 00:56:04,420
It's fine, don't worry about it. I was born at 56 10 o'clock

1075
00:56:06,300 --> 00:56:09,320
Okay, we're going to take that number and then we're going to

1076
00:56:09,320 --> 00:56:13,980
Hold on one second. I've got to call my friend Roger. Hold on

1077
00:56:13,980 --> 00:56:21,120
Roger he's gonna take that number and divide it by 5.5, but he's gonna call his friend Roger Roger

1078
00:56:21,120 --> 00:56:28,260
From American dad. No, it's Roger if Roger didn't have breakfast but did have his multivitamin

1079
00:56:28,260 --> 00:56:31,160
The target gets a head start of 30 seconds on him

1080
00:56:31,160 --> 00:56:35,080
If Roger did have breakfast and it was a grain and it was an odd number

1081
00:56:35,980 --> 00:56:38,940
There's a whole set of rules for this. This is your chance to get away.

1082
00:56:38,940 --> 00:56:41,420
He has to go through this entire rule set.

1083
00:56:41,420 --> 00:56:43,660
And you can get away right now.

1084
00:56:43,660 --> 00:56:46,460
I... Hold on, let me just...

1085
00:56:46,460 --> 00:56:48,460
Do I have... Did I...

1086
00:56:48,460 --> 00:56:50,460
Did I get my chips?

1087
00:56:50,460 --> 00:56:51,980
You did not get your chips.

1088
00:56:51,980 --> 00:56:53,980
I'm gonna wait for my chips.

1089
00:56:53,980 --> 00:56:56,780
He's going to call Roger.

1090
00:56:56,780 --> 00:56:58,780
Roger.

1091
00:56:58,780 --> 00:57:01,180
Where are the chips? Oh god!

1092
00:57:01,180 --> 00:57:04,380
I'm going back into this kitchen right now!

1093
00:57:04,380 --> 00:57:06,060
I walk into the kitchen.

1094
00:57:06,060 --> 00:57:07,060
Okay.

1095
00:57:07,060 --> 00:57:08,060
Wait, wait, hold on.

1096
00:57:08,060 --> 00:57:09,060
Okay, okay, yeah.

1097
00:57:09,060 --> 00:57:10,060
So that's the Easter Bunny.

1098
00:57:10,060 --> 00:57:12,620
He's coming after you now.

1099
00:57:12,620 --> 00:57:13,620
Is he look like a bunny?

1100
00:57:13,620 --> 00:57:15,420
Looks like a rabbit with a great haircut.

1101
00:57:15,420 --> 00:57:17,260
Is he look like a bunny?

1102
00:57:17,260 --> 00:57:19,180
It's a normal question.

1103
00:57:19,180 --> 00:57:20,180
Is he look like a bunny?

1104
00:57:20,180 --> 00:57:22,060
Is he look like a bunny?

1105
00:57:22,060 --> 00:57:23,860
Is he looks like a bunny?

1106
00:57:23,860 --> 00:57:24,860
Is he looks like a bunny?

1107
00:57:24,860 --> 00:57:28,860
I'm storming down to the front desk too, so I'm out of the room.

1108
00:57:28,860 --> 00:57:29,860
I'm checking out.

1109
00:57:29,860 --> 00:57:30,860
I'm checking out.

1110
00:57:31,860 --> 00:57:36,820
come in with a suitcase so I filled it's felt like a complimentary tote bag with

1111
00:57:36,820 --> 00:57:39,500

00:58:05,220 --> 00:58:06,220
"BUBBA BUBBA BUBBA!"

1121
00:58:06,220 --> 00:58:07,220
"NO CHIPS!"

1122
00:58:07,220 --> 00:58:08,820
What was that, the multivitamin or?

1123
00:58:08,820 --> 00:58:10,620

I rolled a three.

1146
00:58:54,300 --> 00:58:56,800
Okay, what is your birthday?

1147
00:58:56,800 --> 00:58:57,820

1148
00:58:57,820 --> 00:59:00,780
You don't know your birthday?

1149
00:59:00,780 --> 00:59:01,280
Nope.

1150
00:59:01,280 --> 00:59:04,780
This is going to be hard.

1151
00:59:04,780 --> 00:59:07,400
Try January 1st, 1922.

1152
00:59:07,400 --> 00:59:08,660
[Laughter]

1153
00:59:08,660 --> 00:59:11,260
Well, that's not my birthday. I don't have, I don't think I have one.

1154
00:59:11,260 --> 00:59:14,620
You know, I think about it, an egg doesn't really have a birthday because it's not born yet.

1155
00:59:14,620 --> 00:59:15,980
So, I don't actually think...

1156
00:59:15,980 --> 00:59:18,300
I mean, a chicken's born from an egg.

1157
00:59:18,300 --> 00:59:20,460
What came first?

1158
00:59:20,460 --> 00:59:22,220
Well, the egg.

1159
00:59:22,860 --> 00:59:23,360
Huh?

1160
00:59:23,360 --> 00:59:25,360
The chicken comes after the egg.

1161
00:59:25,360 --> 00:59:26,360
What came first?

1162
00:59:26,360 --> 00:59:26,860
The egg.

1163
00:59:26,860 --> 00:59:27,860
Who?

1164
00:59:27,860 --> 00:59:28,360
The egg.

1165
00:59:28,360 --> 00:59:29,360
Who's egg first?

1166
00:59:29,360 --> 00:59:30,360
He takes role initiative.

1167
00:59:30,360 --> 00:59:32,360
You just broke his brain.

1168
00:59:32,360 --> 00:59:35,860
You're watching porn?

1169
00:59:35,860 --> 00:59:38,360
I'm trying to, but actually right now I run down.

1170
00:59:38,360 --> 00:59:43,360
Yaukman, Yaukman, I fanned an episode of your show.

1171
00:59:43,360 --> 00:59:45,360
Really? Which one? Which one?

1172
00:59:45,360 --> 00:59:47,360
The one we were talking about earlier.

1173
00:59:47,360 --> 00:59:49,860
I didn't even know they showed that episode on TV.

1174
00:59:49,860 --> 00:59:53,540
I thought we just put that one on laser disk and then we threw them all on a fire.

1175
00:59:53,540 --> 00:59:58,580
I remember when they made laser disk!

1176
00:59:58,580 --> 01:00:00,220
Me too!

1177
01:00:00,220 --> 01:00:03,500
It was the worst day of my life!

1178
01:00:03,500 --> 01:00:04,300
*laughter*

1179
01:00:04,300 --> 01:00:05,620
Me too!

1180
01:00:05,620 --> 01:00:07,200

That's the con- that's the condejo!

1183
01:00:09,860 --> 01:00:10,980
I'm the Easter Bunny.

1184
01:00:10,980 --> 01:00:12,500
That's Mr. Nerdo!

1185
01:00:12,500 --> 01:00:14,420
His name is Comerculo!

1186
01:00:14,420 --> 01:00:15,860
You have something that belongs to me.

1187
01:00:15,860 --> 01:00:17,440
What?

1188
01:00:17,440 --> 01:00:18,080
What?

1189
01:00:18,080 --> 01:00:19,380
My basket.

1190
01:00:19,380 --> 01:00:24,620
Oh, yeah, I'll take a hand. Yeah, we hand on the basket. You can have the biscuit. That's a bathroom

1191
01:00:24,620 --> 01:00:28,000
Where are the eggs?

1192
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:37,820
What else where ads we lost all the eggs

1193
01:00:37,820 --> 01:00:42,940
You will need to get me back the eggs

1194
01:00:42,940 --> 01:00:47,940
Okay, well, what does she know? Yeah, we just have we'll have to read us have to go through that

1195
01:00:47,940 --> 01:00:49,940
Well, we'll figure that out.

1196
01:00:49,940 --> 01:00:51,940
Just give us a few minutes.

1197
01:00:51,940 --> 01:00:53,940
You've already ordered chips.

1198
01:00:53,940 --> 01:00:55,940
Roll deception.

1199
01:00:55,940 --> 01:00:57,940
Sit down and eat the chips.

1200
01:00:57,940 --> 01:00:59,940
Roll deception.

1201
01:00:59,940 --> 01:01:01,940
All of us?

1202
01:01:01,940 --> 01:01:03,940
I got a 3. He got a nat 20.

1203
01:01:03,940 --> 01:01:05,940
I got a nat 20.

1204
01:01:05,940 --> 01:01:07,940
I got a 7.

1205
01:01:07,940 --> 01:01:09,940
I hate what I've done to it.

1206
01:01:09,940 --> 01:01:11,940
Gary Gygax hates me.

1207
01:01:11,940 --> 01:01:13,940
Look at that.

1208
01:01:13,940 --> 01:01:15,940
I have to put on my glasses to see.

1209
01:01:15,940 --> 01:01:22,460
a nat 20 on that. Yeah if it is what that is. Fuck. There's like no way for him to

1210
01:01:22,460 --> 01:01:27,020
believe you except that pretty much. I gave him like very high wisdom because I

1211
01:01:27,020 --> 01:01:36,140
was afraid of this. So just sit here you eat the chips. He has +6 on wisdom and +4 on proficiency.

1212
01:01:36,140 --> 01:01:41,820
We're gonna get this all sorted out. You just sit here and eat the chips.

1213
01:01:41,820 --> 01:01:46,820
is broken. That's on me. So he just goes, okay.

1214
01:01:46,820 --> 01:01:49,860
Can I have some of the chips before I go?

1215
01:01:49,860 --> 01:01:55,060
I slap him in the face with my dick before we walk out.

1216
01:01:55,060 --> 01:01:56,820
Just take advantage of the net toy.

1217
01:01:56,820 --> 01:02:02,140
Yeah. Roll, roll, attack roll with advantage.

1218
01:02:02,140 --> 01:02:05,660
You stupid floppy dick.

1219
01:02:05,660 --> 01:02:08,860
That is an 11.

1220
01:02:09,180 --> 01:02:11,380

Get out of my sight.

1232
01:02:39,860 --> 01:02:41,860
Okay, well, great to meet you, Yolkman.

1233
01:02:41,860 --> 01:02:42,860

1234
01:02:42,860 --> 01:02:43,860
Well, alright.

1235
01:02:43,860 --> 01:02:46,860
Wait, can I roll? Can I do a roll right now?

1236
01:02:46,860 --> 01:02:47,860
You can do whatever you want.

1237
01:02:47,860 --> 01:02:48,860
This is gonna...

1238
01:02:48,860 --> 01:02:50,860
You gotta restart the fight, though.

1239
01:02:50,860 --> 01:02:51,860
I will say.

1240
01:02:51,860 --> 01:02:52,860
No, we need to get out of here.

1241
01:02:52,860 --> 01:02:53,860
We need to leave.

1242
01:02:53,860 --> 01:02:55,860
I was gonna try and steal his wallet.

1243
01:02:55,860 --> 01:02:58,860
Wait, wait, oh, we should steal that guy's car keys, so...

1244
01:02:58,860 --> 01:03:00,860
Oh, that's it? Okay.

1245
01:03:00,860 --> 01:03:02,860
We gotta have a car.

1246
01:03:02,860 --> 01:03:03,860
We probably got here.

1247
01:03:03,860 --> 01:03:04,860
I've got an 18.

1248
01:03:04,860 --> 01:03:06,860
Do we have a car?

1249
01:03:06,860 --> 01:03:08,860

1254
01:03:16,860 --> 01:03:21,860
can i use the fact that i'm in the red dress to seduce him with maybe a persuasion

1255
01:03:21,860 --> 01:03:23,860
with this roll instead of a slight of hand

1256
01:03:23,860 --> 01:03:25,860
so you already have the slight of hand

1257
01:03:25,860 --> 01:03:27,860

1258
01:03:27,860 --> 01:03:29,860

Any man would be lucky to fuck you!

What? Why do you throw the dice like that?

1279
01:04:17,380 --> 01:04:19,380
It's like a two year old.

01:04:19,380 --> 01:04:21,380
Well I got a 17.

1281

1285
01:04:29,900 --> 01:04:31,900
Back off, she's mine.

1286
01:04:31,900 --> 01:04:33,900

1287
01:04:33,900 --> 01:04:34,400

1289
01:04:36,400 --> 01:04:37,900

1290
01:04:37,900 --> 01:04:39,900

01:04:39,900 --> 01:04:41,900

1292
01:04:41,900 --> 01:04:42,900
I pull the phone up.

1293
01:04:42,900 --> 01:04:45,900
I can't fuck you, my son has cancer.

1294
01:04:45,900 --> 01:04:47,900
Well, I guess I'm gonna go with him.

1295
01:04:47,900 --> 01:04:49,900
You owe me $70.

1296
01:04:49,900 --> 01:04:51,900
You got his car keys, right?

1297
01:04:51,900 --> 01:04:52,400
Yeah.

1298
01:04:52,400 --> 01:04:53,900
I would turn to him and be like...

1299
01:04:53,900 --> 01:04:55,900
I'm going to kill you.

1300
01:04:55,900 --> 01:04:57,900
I was thinking of featuring...

1301
01:04:57,900 --> 01:05:02,140
I saw you from across the bar and I was thinking of featuring you on an episode of Yolkman's Garage.

1302
01:05:02,140 --> 01:05:05,260
Could I ask you what color and make your car is, sir?

1303
01:05:05,260 --> 01:05:06,900
Oh, sure.

1304
01:05:06,900 --> 01:05:09,300
It's, uh, it's a Mazda...

1305
01:05:09,300 --> 01:05:12,140
Oh God, what's the model?

1306
01:05:12,140 --> 01:05:13,740
Mazda Miata?

1307
01:05:13,740 --> 01:05:15,740
Heavens! Is it lowered?

1308
01:05:15,740 --> 01:05:17,340
Let me just look up...

1309
01:05:17,340 --> 01:05:19,340
Do you have a lowered Mazda Miata?

1310
01:05:19,340 --> 01:05:21,340
Look up some models.

1311
01:05:21,340 --> 01:05:23,340
Does it have a straight pipe?

1312
01:05:23,340 --> 01:05:27,340
I'm looking at the Mazda website right now.

1313
01:05:27,340 --> 01:05:28,340
from high school.

1314
01:05:28,340 --> 01:05:29,740
I just, it's a simple question.

1315
01:05:29,740 --> 01:05:31,940
It's a Mazda CX9.

1316
01:05:31,940 --> 01:05:34,140
Okay, uh, what color is it?

1317
01:05:34,140 --> 01:05:35,140
It's gray.

1318
01:05:35,140 --> 01:05:36,140
Yeah, no chance.

1319
01:05:36,140 --> 01:05:37,140
Sorry, pal.

01:05:37,140 --> 01:05:38,140
Well, we'll see ya.

1321
01:05:38,140 --> 01:05:40,940
Okay, well, I'll keep these and we're gonna go.

1322
01:05:40,940 --> 01:05:44,020
And while I'm leaving, I turn the alarm on in the car.

1323
01:05:44,020 --> 01:05:47,900
All of you roll dexterity saving throws because the Easter Bunny is shooting his Fortnite

01:08:00,480 --> 01:08:06,040
You're an egg I'm an egg I can have whatever I want

1369
01:08:06,040 --> 01:08:14,480
Curious no because it's where he's an hour in ten minutes. I know you need to lay down the law

1370
01:08:14,480 --> 01:08:19,040
I know it's one of these things where I'm like I want to play the game that Patrick is playing

1371
01:08:19,040 --> 01:08:23,200
because that sounds much more creative where it's like yeah now I have a pussy and I could

1372
01:08:23,200 --> 01:08:26,960
shoot egg eggs out of that. Don't let him do this to you. I know I can't let you do this.

1373
01:08:26,960 --> 01:08:30,640
You need to have some more more pride. It is an hour and 10 minutes. I've been doing this with

1374
01:08:30,640 --> 01:08:37,440
you guys for two years. You can't do it. Why did you look at your watch for two years? He's had a

1375
01:08:37,440 --> 01:08:43,600
timer going the entire time. It's a little joke. All right yeah so you guys are able to get to the

1376
01:08:43,600 --> 01:08:50,000
the car. You are knocked out, though. I tied my wiener around his leg to drag him

1377
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:54,640
behind me while I run. So you get to the Mazda CX-9. Okay, okay, what part of your

1378
01:08:54,640 --> 01:08:57,960
body do you want me to tie my wiener around? Fucking my lips. Okay, your lips.

1379
01:08:57,960 --> 01:09:04,680
Okay, you have to get to the airport. The airport is in Universal Studios, Texas,

1380
01:09:04,680 --> 01:09:10,680
so it's two days journey. It's Good Friday. You can get there by Easter Sunday.

1381
01:09:10,680 --> 01:09:16,680
okay my nephew works at the airport what's this see we just got guys we just

1382
01:09:16,680 --> 01:09:23,400

1383
01:09:23,400 --> 01:09:27,120
always ask the fall that's my problem you're right I won't say anything I'm

1384
01:09:27,120 --> 01:09:34,120
resuscitating Humpty Dumpty okay how are you doing that I guess I'm driving

1385
01:09:37,200 --> 01:09:40,000
The 100 year old egg is driving the car.

1386
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:42,360
I'm bouncing up and down on him.

1387
01:09:42,360 --> 01:09:43,360
Like a trampoline.

1388
01:09:43,360 --> 01:09:44,360
Don't you fucking die!

1389
01:09:44,360 --> 01:09:45,360
You do that thing?

1390
01:09:45,360 --> 01:09:46,360
Say the fucking words!

1391
01:09:46,360 --> 01:09:48,320
Do I need a death saving roll or no?

1392
01:09:48,320 --> 01:09:49,320
Yeah, you do.

1393
01:09:49,320 --> 01:09:50,320
Okay.

1394
01:09:50,320 --> 01:09:51,320
Unless you guys are...

1395
01:09:51,320 --> 01:09:52,320
One of you guys has smells.

1396
01:09:52,320 --> 01:09:53,320
Hey, now I'm bouncing up and down.

1397
01:09:53,320 --> 01:09:54,320
One of you guys I think has healing.

1398
01:09:54,320 --> 01:09:55,960
Hey, I'm bouncing up and down on his damn...

1399
01:09:55,960 --> 01:09:57,400
You're the one with healing?

1400
01:09:57,400 --> 01:10:00,160
On his damn lower back like a trampstampoline.

1401
01:10:00,160 --> 01:10:04,680
Yeah, sure.

1402
01:10:04,680 --> 01:10:05,680
I think I gave...

1403
01:10:05,680 --> 01:10:07,680
I'll do it on the chive later.

1404
01:10:07,680 --> 01:10:09,680
You gave me defender egg.

1405
01:10:09,680 --> 01:10:11,680
I know I gave you defender egg. I thought I gave one egg.

1406
01:10:11,680 --> 01:10:13,680
That's what I was trying to do with my pussy.

1407
01:10:13,680 --> 01:10:15,680
I don't have any healing.

1408
01:10:15,680 --> 01:10:17,680
No yoke man I thought I gave you healing.

1409
01:10:17,680 --> 01:10:19,680
How do I do this death saving roll again?

1410
01:10:19,680 --> 01:10:21,680
You gave me a melee attack and a ranged attack and that's it.

1411
01:10:21,680 --> 01:10:27,680
Oh shit.

1412
01:10:27,680 --> 01:10:29,680
Oh well. Roll death saving throw.

1413
01:10:29,680 --> 01:10:31,680
I thought I was healing him. Wait hold on I can't stabilize him.

1414
01:10:31,680 --> 01:10:33,680
Oh you can stabilize him.

1415
01:10:33,680 --> 01:10:34,680
I'm sorry about that.

1416
01:10:34,680 --> 01:10:35,680
Rolled you 20.

1417
01:10:35,680 --> 01:10:36,680
Oh my god.

1418
01:10:36,680 --> 01:10:37,680
Uh, 20.

1419
01:10:37,680 --> 01:10:38,680
Not natural.

1420
01:10:38,680 --> 01:10:39,680
But that's fine.

1421
01:10:39,680 --> 01:10:40,680
He's stabilized.

1422
01:10:40,680 --> 01:10:41,680
You're stabilized so you only need to do death saving throws.

1423
01:10:41,680 --> 01:10:42,680
Beast mode.

1424
01:10:42,680 --> 01:10:43,680
Uh, we'll basically like-

1425
01:10:43,680 --> 01:10:44,680
It's gonna be my new catchphrase the rest of the campaign.

1426
01:10:44,680 --> 01:10:45,680
What was it?

1427
01:10:45,680 --> 01:10:46,680
Beast mode.

1428
01:10:46,680 --> 01:10:47,680
Are you saying beast mode or beast mode?

1429
01:10:47,680 --> 01:10:48,680
Beast mode.

1430
01:10:48,680 --> 01:10:49,680
I guess beast mode would make sense because we're food.

1431
01:10:49,680 --> 01:10:50,680
Like a wild beast.

1432
01:10:50,680 --> 01:10:51,680
Like a-

1433
01:10:51,680 --> 01:10:52,680
Beast?

1434
01:10:52,680 --> 01:10:53,680
Are you saying beast mode?

1435
01:10:53,680 --> 01:10:54,680
Like a wild beast.

1436
01:10:54,680 --> 01:10:55,680
Like a wild beast.

1437
01:10:55,680 --> 01:10:56,680
Like a wild beast.

1438
01:10:56,680 --> 01:10:57,680
Like a wild beast.

1439
01:10:57,680 --> 01:10:58,680
Like a wild beast.

1440
01:10:58,680 --> 01:10:59,680
Like a wild beast.

1441
01:10:59,680 --> 01:11:00,680
Like a wild beast.

1442
01:11:00,680 --> 01:11:01,680
Like a wild beast.

1443
01:11:01,680 --> 01:11:02,680
Like a wild beast.

1444
01:11:02,680 --> 01:11:04,680
Are you saying base or beast?

1445
01:11:04,680 --> 01:11:08,680
I don't know what base or beast is.

1446
01:11:08,680 --> 01:11:10,680
Who is this?

1447
01:11:10,680 --> 01:11:13,680
Why did you turn this damn radio off?

1448
01:11:13,680 --> 01:11:15,680
There's so much going on in that damn car.

1449
01:11:15,680 --> 01:11:17,680
I can't focus while I'm driving.

1450
01:11:17,680 --> 01:11:19,680
I can never play.

1451
01:11:19,680 --> 01:11:25,680
So yeah, you guys are driving in the Mazda CX-9.

1452
01:11:25,680 --> 01:11:27,680
You're booking it.

1453
01:11:27,680 --> 01:11:31,680
Obviously, the Easter Bunny is after you.

1454
01:11:31,680 --> 01:11:37,560
You drive for hours and hours and hours. You're now resuscitated. Let's get you at roll a hit die

1455
01:11:37,560 --> 01:11:40,940
So let's figure out how much you get. I think your hit die is 8? D8, right?

1456
01:11:40,940 --> 01:11:44,840
Which one? It's the one that's like two triangles. This one?

1457
01:11:44,840 --> 01:11:48,880
One

1458
01:11:48,880 --> 01:11:50,880
Cool, but add your con

1459
01:11:50,880 --> 01:11:56,260
It's zero. So you got one back. Okay, it's not bad. You got one HP brother

1460
01:11:56,260 --> 01:12:00,600
So you guys, but here's the thing you guys have the opportunity to stop at a motel. Can I heal up too?

1461
01:12:01,440 --> 01:12:03,680
Um, yeah, you guys can all do short rests for this.

1462
01:12:03,680 --> 01:12:04,180
Okay.

1463
01:12:04,180 --> 01:12:07,840
Short rest is how much hit dice?

1464
01:12:07,840 --> 01:12:08,960
How many times are you rolling?

1465
01:12:08,960 --> 01:12:10,720
You guys all have two hit dice for this one.

1466
01:12:10,720 --> 01:12:11,280
Oh, okay.

1467
01:12:11,280 --> 01:12:13,840
I'm gonna roll technically level two for this one.

1468
01:12:13,840 --> 01:12:15,360
Okay, so I can roll another one?

1469
01:12:15,360 --> 01:12:16,080
Yes.

1470
01:12:16,080 --> 01:12:17,360
Okay, I got 10 back.

1471
01:12:17,360 --> 01:12:17,920
Oh, shit.

1472
01:12:17,920 --> 01:12:19,680
I'm at 14.

1473
01:12:19,680 --> 01:12:20,320
I'm up to seven.

1474
01:12:20,320 --> 01:12:22,240
Damn, playboy!

1475
01:12:22,240 --> 01:12:23,120
Look at me!

1476
01:12:23,120 --> 01:12:24,320
I'm 7 HP.

1477
01:12:24,320 --> 01:12:25,280
Okay.

1478
01:12:25,280 --> 01:12:30,960
I got 7 plus 6.

1479
01:12:30,960 --> 01:12:31,460
Cool.

1480
01:12:31,460 --> 01:12:31,960
What is that?

1481
01:12:31,960 --> 01:12:32,460
Thirteen.

1482
01:12:32,460 --> 01:12:32,960
You got it.

1483
01:12:32,960 --> 01:12:35,460
So you guys are at a motel.

1484
01:12:35,460 --> 01:12:36,960
If you guys- you guys can stay at a motel rather.

1485
01:12:36,960 --> 01:12:38,460
Sorry, I didn't mean you're at a motel.

1486
01:12:38,460 --> 01:12:40,960
You can either do a rest stop, you can stay at a motel.

1487
01:12:40,960 --> 01:12:42,460
Or you can just keep driving.

1488
01:12:42,460 --> 01:12:44,460
I'm driving this car to Chuck E. Cheese.

1489
01:12:44,460 --> 01:12:44,960
If you keep-

1490
01:12:44,960 --> 01:12:48,960
*snickers*

1491
01:12:48,960 --> 01:12:49,460
I don't know why that got me.

1492
01:12:49,460 --> 01:12:52,460
The only 24 hour Chuck E. Cheese in Texas and they know me.

1493
01:12:52,460 --> 01:12:53,960
They know me there.

1494
01:12:53,960 --> 01:12:54,960
If you guys drive-

1495
01:12:54,960 --> 01:12:57,460
It's like a casino but you pay more.

1496
01:12:57,460 --> 01:13:00,460
There's a chance that the Easter Bunny finds you.

1497
01:13:00,460 --> 01:13:03,820
Remember there was a whole system I developed for this but we don't have time.

1498
01:13:03,820 --> 01:13:05,260
But instead, here's what it is.

1499
01:13:05,260 --> 01:13:07,820
There's a chance that the Easter Bunny finds you.

1500
01:13:07,820 --> 01:13:13,920
If you keep driving, the Easter Bunny probably won't find you at the motel.

1501
01:13:13,920 --> 01:13:14,920
If you just drive through it.

1502
01:13:14,920 --> 01:13:15,920
He's not going to find you.

1503
01:13:15,920 --> 01:13:16,920
He won't find you at the motel.

1504
01:13:16,920 --> 01:13:17,920
He probably won't find you on the road.

1505
01:13:17,920 --> 01:13:18,920
It's very unlikely.

1506
01:13:18,920 --> 01:13:19,920
What's the disadvantage then?

1507
01:13:19,920 --> 01:13:22,880
If you stay at the motel, you can do a long rest.

1508
01:13:22,880 --> 01:13:26,400
If you keep driving though, you become cooked.

1509
01:13:26,400 --> 01:13:28,080
So you saw those eggs in the field?

1510
01:13:28,080 --> 01:13:29,560
There's two ways that that happens to eggs.

1511
01:13:29,560 --> 01:13:32,840
When they don't get proper rest or when they're just generally killed.

1512
01:13:32,840 --> 01:13:38,840
If you're cooked, you have half HP, disadvantage on ability checks, and saving throws until

1513
01:13:38,840 --> 01:13:39,840
you long rest.

1514
01:13:39,840 --> 01:13:42,480
I don't care, I'm getting cooked.

1515
01:13:42,480 --> 01:13:45,200
I'm in the car, I'm driving.

1516
01:13:45,200 --> 01:13:46,440
I'm ready to get cooked.

1517
01:13:46,440 --> 01:13:47,440
I could, I could.

1518
01:13:47,440 --> 01:13:48,440
Let's take a vote.

1519
01:13:48,440 --> 01:13:49,440
Alright, I'm ready.

1520
01:13:49,440 --> 01:13:53,680
I vote to go to the motel.

1521
01:13:53,680 --> 01:13:55,640
Sounds pretty beast mode to me.

1522
01:13:55,640 --> 01:13:59,320
I still don't know if you're saying "baste" or "beast."

1523
01:13:59,320 --> 01:14:00,800
I vote for "cucked."

1524
01:14:00,800 --> 01:14:07,040
Alright, well I guess we're at a stalemate.

1525
01:14:07,040 --> 01:14:10,080
No you are the one who could... there is no stalemate, there's three of you.

1526
01:14:10,080 --> 01:14:14,880
So I'm gonna just crash the car into oncoming traffic.

1527
01:14:14,880 --> 01:14:16,560
That's what I'm gonna do.

1528
01:14:16,560 --> 01:14:19,400
I'm gonna crash this car into oncoming traffic.

1529
01:14:19,400 --> 01:14:20,400
Please vote.

1530
01:14:20,400 --> 01:14:27,400
I'm gonna drive the car all the way into oncoming traffic and no one's gonna survive.

1531
01:14:27,400 --> 01:14:31,400
There's gonna be no survivors.

1532
01:14:31,400 --> 01:14:34,400
Everyone here is gonna die with me tonight.

1533
01:14:34,400 --> 01:14:35,400
Here's the thing.

1534
01:14:35,400 --> 01:14:37,400
And I pull into the motel.

1535
01:14:37,400 --> 01:14:40,400
I was gonna let you do that.

1536
01:14:40,400 --> 01:14:43,400
Oh shit, I missed all the traffic.

1537
01:14:43,400 --> 01:14:47,400
I pulled off of the off ramp and went into this motel.

1538
01:14:47,400 --> 01:14:51,800
So I'm going to roll for Easter Bunny and see if he finds you.

1539
01:14:51,800 --> 01:14:54,480
I'm not going to tell you the result.

1540
01:14:54,480 --> 01:14:55,480
He's got to tell.

1541
01:14:55,480 --> 01:14:56,480
Okay.

1542
01:14:56,480 --> 01:14:57,480
I saw it.

1543
01:14:57,480 --> 01:14:58,480
He found us.

1544
01:14:58,480 --> 01:14:59,480
It was a 100.

1545
01:14:59,480 --> 01:15:00,480
I looked at his eyes.

1546
01:15:00,480 --> 01:15:01,480
He did a little smile.

1547
01:15:01,480 --> 01:15:02,480
He found us.

1548
01:15:02,480 --> 01:15:03,480
What do you guys do at the motel?

1549
01:15:03,480 --> 01:15:04,480
What do you guys do?

1550
01:15:04,480 --> 01:15:06,040
I probably get fucking killed by Easter Bunny, obviously.

1551
01:15:06,040 --> 01:15:07,520
Flipping the channels.

1552
01:15:07,520 --> 01:15:08,840
I'm still in my red dress.

1553
01:15:08,840 --> 01:15:11,840
I'm standing out front.

1554
01:15:11,840 --> 01:15:14,080
(laughing)

1555
01:15:14,080 --> 01:15:24,360
- Welcome to the Acarolage, I'm the concierge.

1556
01:15:24,360 --> 01:15:26,640
- I thought you were working the streets.

1557
01:15:26,640 --> 01:15:28,440
- You can pay me for sex.

1558
01:15:28,440 --> 01:15:29,760
- Okay, just checking.

1559
01:15:29,760 --> 01:15:31,400
- That's what I thought, yeah.

1560
01:15:31,400 --> 01:15:32,240
- All right, cool.

1561
01:15:32,240 --> 01:15:33,480
What are you guys, you guys watching TV again?

1562
01:15:33,480 --> 01:15:34,320
- I'm flipping, yeah, I'm flipping.

1563
01:15:34,320 --> 01:15:35,720
- Can I roll? - Roll investigation.

1564
01:15:35,720 --> 01:15:38,080
- I'm kind of, I'm occupying sort of a henchman role

1565
01:15:38,080 --> 01:15:39,240
for him. - Okay, cool.

1566
01:15:39,240 --> 01:15:40,080
- Yeah.

1567
01:15:40,080 --> 01:15:42,960
- Dumpty Dumpty is the henchman for the more famous Yoakaman.

1568
01:15:42,960 --> 01:15:43,800
- That's a 12.

1569
01:15:43,800 --> 01:15:44,620
- Yeah, exactly.

1570
01:15:44,620 --> 01:15:46,600
- Everyone knows Yoakaman.

1571
01:15:46,600 --> 01:15:50,240
- I was a minor celebrity back in the day, you know?

1572
01:15:50,240 --> 01:15:51,080
You may be ahead of me, but--

1573
01:15:51,080 --> 01:15:53,080
- Oh yeah, no, you're honestly,

1574
01:15:53,080 --> 01:15:54,920
you're one of my biggest inspirations.

1575
01:15:54,920 --> 01:15:56,120
- Nah, you don't mean that.

1576
01:15:56,120 --> 01:15:56,960
- No, I'm serious.

1577
01:15:56,960 --> 01:15:58,440
- That's straight beast, man.

1578
01:15:58,440 --> 01:15:59,440
(laughing)

1579
01:15:59,440 --> 01:16:02,880
- I studied a lot of your work for my episode,

1580
01:16:02,880 --> 01:16:04,200
The Stupid Ant.

1581
01:16:04,200 --> 01:16:05,720
(laughing)

1582
01:16:05,720 --> 01:16:07,000
The Stupid Ant, that's the sequel

1583
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:08,760
to The Stupidest Ant in the World.

1584
01:16:08,760 --> 01:16:16,620
I'm poking a guy in a machine and I'm asking you the highest compliments I've

1585
01:16:16,620 --> 01:16:17,120
ever had.

1586
01:16:17,120 --> 01:16:20,320
I inspired in episode of Yankman.

1587
01:16:20,320 --> 01:16:23,920
My God, you from my episode.

1588
01:16:23,920 --> 01:16:28,220
I also you're also inspired to be a fucker egg who poops himself.

1589
01:16:28,220 --> 01:16:32,920
Yokeman fucks a pig that one was based on me.

1590
01:16:32,920 --> 01:16:37,620
Yeah, that's one of my favorite episodes for obvious reasons.

1591
01:16:37,620 --> 01:16:40,980
*laughter*

1592
01:16:40,980 --> 01:16:43,900
I'm gonna find you a show on TV no matter what.

1593
01:16:43,900 --> 01:16:46,560
And I just started like punching in numbers on the microwave.

1594
01:16:46,560 --> 01:16:48,560
*laughter*

1595
01:16:48,560 --> 01:16:50,560
Don't think it's on this one.

1596
01:16:50,560 --> 01:16:52,560
You're all a hundred years old.

1597
01:16:52,560 --> 01:16:54,560
It's not on 1 minute 30.

1598
01:16:54,560 --> 01:16:56,560
It's not on popcorn.

1599
01:16:56,560 --> 01:16:57,960
*laughter*

1600
01:16:57,960 --> 01:16:59,960
Let's check defrost.

1601
01:16:59,960 --> 01:17:01,960
*laughter*

1602
01:17:01,960 --> 01:17:03,960
These channels suck!

1603
01:17:03,960 --> 01:17:05,960
Try a timer!

1604
01:17:05,960 --> 01:17:09,960
Basic cable. Cheap ass motel.

1605
01:17:09,960 --> 01:17:13,960
Um, yeah you guys get a good night's rest.

01:17:33,960 --> 01:17:35,960
With your money that you don't have

1612

01:18:32,640 --> 01:18:48,360

1623
01:18:53,720 --> 01:18:59,500
I'm standing I'm standing you let it flow. I couldn't do that

1624
01:18:59,500 --> 01:19:05,100
Where would be okay to be a terrorist? It's an Easter one. I'm standing in front of the airport

1625
01:19:05,100 --> 01:19:07,100
I'm doing jumping jacks. I'm saying

1626
01:19:07,100 --> 01:19:14,680
We got away from the Easter Bunny we did it he's gone. He's never gonna see me

1627
01:19:14,680 --> 01:19:17,320
He's never gonna pull up in a car.

1628
01:19:17,320 --> 01:19:19,720
He's never gonna know where we are.

1629
01:19:19,720 --> 01:19:21,720
We did it. We did it.

1630
01:19:21,720 --> 01:19:25,160
He's never gonna know that we're here.

1631
01:19:25,160 --> 01:19:27,160
He's not pulling up right now.

1632
01:19:27,160 --> 01:19:29,160
Now. Now.

1633
01:19:29,160 --> 01:19:31,160
3, 2, 1, now.

1634
01:19:31,160 --> 01:19:33,160
3, 2, 1, now.

1635
01:19:33,160 --> 01:19:35,160
3, 2, 1, now.

1636
01:19:35,160 --> 01:19:37,160
I have pre-checked, which line do I go in?

1637
01:19:37,160 --> 01:19:39,160
The Easter egg hunt.

1638
01:19:39,160 --> 01:19:44,160
If the Easter egg hunt led you here, what use was the hunt?

1639
01:19:44,160 --> 01:19:45,160
What?

1640
01:19:45,160 --> 01:19:47,160
What does that mean?

1641
01:19:47,160 --> 01:19:50,160
I read it in the fortune cookie.

1642
01:19:50,160 --> 01:19:56,160
Sounds like an oddly specific fortune cookie, some kind of Easter Chinese restaurant.

1643
01:19:56,160 --> 01:19:59,160
Do they serve egg old?

1644
01:19:59,160 --> 01:20:01,160
Egg food old?

1645
01:20:01,160 --> 01:20:03,160
Do they serve egg too old?

1646
01:20:03,160 --> 01:20:05,160
That's gonna be a fist bump with me.

1647
01:20:05,160 --> 01:20:07,160
Let's go!

1648
01:20:07,160 --> 01:20:09,160
It was base mode.

1649
01:20:09,160 --> 01:20:11,160
(Laughter)

1650
01:20:11,160 --> 01:20:13,160
At that Chinese restaurant, they serve egg foo old.

1651
01:20:13,160 --> 01:20:15,160
(Explosion)

1652
01:20:15,160 --> 01:20:17,160
I'm going to kill you all now.

1653
01:20:17,160 --> 01:20:19,160
I have TSA pre-check you can't kill me into that water.

1654
01:20:19,160 --> 01:20:21,160
TSA pre-check?

1655
01:20:21,160 --> 01:20:23,160
You can't kill me?

1656
01:20:23,160 --> 01:20:25,160
You have TSA pre-check?

1657
01:20:25,160 --> 01:20:27,160
TSA.

1658
01:20:27,160 --> 01:20:29,160
Okay.

1659
01:20:29,160 --> 01:20:31,160
You try getting a weird fucking egg cannon through TSA.

1660
01:20:31,160 --> 01:20:33,160
There's so many people here.

1661
01:20:33,160 --> 01:20:35,160
Are you going to kill us here?

1662
01:20:35,160 --> 01:20:41,640
here? I have a cold. Why didn't you kill us at the motel last night? You guys were at the motel?

1663
01:20:41,640 --> 01:20:47,240

Okay. He didn't have better than... he didn't roll better than a 6 on initiative?

1694
01:22:57,340 --> 01:23:01,780
impossible for me to hit him because I have an initiative or ever you got a

1695
01:23:01,780 --> 01:23:06,540

1704
01:23:48,680 --> 01:23:49,980
- Let me see.

1705
01:23:49,980 --> 01:23:51,560
- Don't look at it, okay, he's going, come on.

1706
01:23:51,560 --> 01:23:52,400
- Go ahead, touch the sheet.

1707
01:23:52,400 --> 01:23:53,920
- Upwards of 30 feet high.

1708
01:23:53,920 --> 01:23:56,200
- Upwards, upwards, upwards of 30 feet.

1709
01:23:56,200 --> 01:23:57,780
That means anything above 30 feet.

1710
01:23:57,780 --> 01:23:58,960
- That's not what that means.

1711
01:23:58,960 --> 01:24:01,360
- Upwards of 30 feet, that is what that means.

1712
01:24:01,360 --> 01:24:03,200
- I'm looking up what upwards means now.

1713
01:24:03,200 --> 01:24:04,040
- Oh my God.

1714
01:24:04,040 --> 01:24:05,360
- Okay, it doesn't matter what upwards,

1715
01:24:05,360 --> 01:24:08,920
listen, it doesn't matter what upwards means in numbers,

1716
01:24:08,920 --> 01:24:09,760
first of all, that's true,

1717
01:24:09,760 --> 01:24:13,060
but also upwards is upwards, directionally,

1718
01:24:13,060 --> 01:24:14,760
- It has to be above 30 feet.

1719
01:24:14,760 --> 01:24:15,600
- 30 is the minimum.

1720
01:24:15,600 --> 01:24:16,820
- Minimum 30 feet.

1721
01:24:16,820 --> 01:24:19,480
- It does mean 30's the minimum.

1722
01:24:19,480 --> 01:24:20,320
- Yeah.

1723
01:24:20,320 --> 01:24:21,160
- Is it really?

1724
01:24:21,160 --> 01:24:23,860
Should I have wrote up to?

1725
01:24:23,860 --> 01:24:25,120
- It does, but if it doesn't--

1726
01:24:25,120 --> 01:24:28,020
- You should have said up to.

1727
01:24:28,020 --> 01:24:28,860
- No.

1728
01:24:28,860 --> 01:24:30,160
- Yes you, yeah.

1729
01:24:30,160 --> 01:24:31,420
- That's Patrick trying to trick me.

1730
01:24:31,420 --> 01:24:32,920
- No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1731
01:24:32,920 --> 01:24:33,760
- If I know that, that's a problem.

1732
01:24:33,760 --> 01:24:34,660
- Listen to what I'm saying too.

1733
01:24:34,660 --> 01:24:36,580
It doesn't matter whether it means that or not,

1734
01:24:36,580 --> 01:24:37,420
because you go up for it.

1735
01:24:37,420 --> 01:24:39,940
- Okay, genuinely, I love when I get called out

1736
01:24:39,940 --> 01:24:41,820
on me not doing this.

1737
01:24:41,820 --> 01:24:44,140
I'm going to look it up right now. Upwards versus up to.

1738
01:24:44,140 --> 01:24:50,220
Guys, I think we win. Guys, I think we's going to win this.

1739
01:24:50,220 --> 01:24:52,660
Guys, I think we might actually win him.

1740
01:24:52,660 --> 01:24:57,140
This is the most, this is like, honestly,

1741
01:24:57,140 --> 01:24:58,620
the most tense I've ever felt in the DND session.

1742
01:24:58,620 --> 01:25:00,300
The most suspense ever.

1743
01:25:00,300 --> 01:25:04,020
Up to 10 feet tall means that, okay, here.

1744
01:25:04,020 --> 01:25:07,140
Up to 10 feet tall means that the tallest tree of that type is,

1745
01:25:07,140 --> 01:25:08,820
speak in the it's Google right.

1746
01:25:08,820 --> 01:25:16,840
Google with their trees right up words of ten feet tall implies that the tree

1747
01:25:16,840 --> 01:25:21,140
typically grows ten feet, but some or many examples may be taller than that.

1748
01:25:21,140 --> 01:25:25,060
Yes, all right, let's do

1749
01:25:25,060 --> 01:25:28,660
all right, so that I'm okay, so

1750
01:25:28,660 --> 01:25:34,580
wait, but I still have to hit him. Yeah, that's the thing I have to I have to

1751
01:25:34,580 --> 01:25:35,060
crit

1752
01:25:36,700 --> 01:25:38,460
that's one thing and i don't know can i

1753
01:25:38,460 --> 01:25:39,900
assist if i do that you're not even

1754
01:25:39,900 --> 01:25:40,900
gonna make me roll damage because

1755
01:25:40,900 --> 01:25:43,860
theoretically i can roll infinite die or

1756
01:25:43,860 --> 01:25:45,460
infinite guys can't wait wait even if

1757
01:25:45,460 --> 01:25:47,420
they were can you can you hold can you

1758
01:25:47,420 --> 01:25:49,100
hold can you hold this of us can you

1759
01:25:49,100 --> 01:25:51,540
pick both of us episode you'll never be

1760
01:25:51,540 --> 01:25:53,940
released

1761
01:25:53,940 --> 01:25:56,900
this will ruin my cred in the DM

1762
01:25:56,900 --> 01:25:59,980
community he's gonna hold on to both of

1763
01:25:59,980 --> 01:26:02,300
us as he goes up I have I mean like

1764
01:26:02,300 --> 01:26:04,740

1765
01:26:04,740 --> 01:26:05,940
I can't wait to fly!

1766
01:26:05,940 --> 01:26:08,740
Yeah, we're both p- I'm piggybacking on you and he's piggybacking on me.

1767
01:26:08,740 --> 01:26:14,420
I'm gonna let you get advantage because you basically just called me a bitch in front of our

1768
01:26:14,420 --> 01:26:17,380
hundreds of millions of fans.

1769
01:26:17,380 --> 01:26:21,140
It's funny that I wasn't even thinking that. I was just gonna put my thumb over the rules

1770
01:26:21,140 --> 01:26:24,980
to hope that you didn't look and he actually got you with the whole word thing.

1771
01:26:24,980 --> 01:26:26,660
All right.

1772
01:26:26,660 --> 01:26:27,700
I'm very depressed.

1773
01:26:27,700 --> 01:26:31,060
That's 15, so that's 16.

01:26:31,060 --> 01:26:32,980

Nope.

01:28:26,060 --> 01:28:27,060
Nope.

01:28:27,060 --> 01:28:28,060
Oh god.

01:28:28,060 --> 01:28:29,060
What'd I say?

1808
01:28:29,060 --> 01:28:30,060
You take 14 damage.

1809
01:28:30,060 --> 01:28:31,060
1 HP.

1810
01:28:31,060 --> 01:28:32,060
Me too.

Great.

01:28:34,060 --> 01:28:35,060
I take no damage?

1814
01:28:35,060 --> 01:28:36,060
You take none.

1815
01:28:36,060 --> 01:28:37,060
Cause I didn't do half damage shit with this one.

1816
01:28:37,060 --> 01:28:38,060
Why don't you give me some of your yolk?

1817
01:28:38,060 --> 01:28:39,060
You're up.

I'm up.

1821
01:28:42,060 --> 01:28:43,060
I'm up.

1822
01:28:43,060 --> 01:28:44,060
I'm up.

1823
01:28:44,060 --> 01:28:45,060
I'm up.

1824
01:28:45,060 --> 01:28:46,060
I'm up.

1825
01:28:46,060 --> 01:28:47,060
I'm up.

1826
01:28:47,060 --> 01:28:48,060
I'm up.

1827
01:28:48,060 --> 01:28:49,060
I'm up.

1828
01:28:49,060 --> 01:28:50,060
I'm up.

1829
01:28:50,060 --> 01:28:51,060
I'm up.

1830
01:28:51,060 --> 01:28:52,060
I'm up.

1831
01:28:52,060 --> 01:28:53,260
(whistling)

1832
01:28:53,260 --> 01:28:54,700
- Oh wait, no, no, you're up first.

1833
01:28:54,700 --> 01:28:55,540
- Sorry.

1834
01:28:55,540 --> 01:28:57,140
(whistling)

1835
01:28:57,140 --> 01:28:58,440
- I'm gonna use my urine.

1836
01:28:58,440 --> 01:29:01,300
- What is the DC?

1837
01:29:01,300 --> 01:29:03,660
- There's no real point to you guys attacking him, I guess.

1838
01:29:03,660 --> 01:29:05,260
- Actually, no, I'm gonna use Defender Egg.

1839
01:29:05,260 --> 01:29:06,420
- Yeah, that's a good idea.

1840
01:29:06,420 --> 01:29:08,340
- Well, no, that's a reaction.

1841
01:29:08,340 --> 01:29:10,580
- Well, I'm reacting to him being mean to me.

1842
01:29:10,580 --> 01:29:12,220
- All right, you could have done that earlier,

1843
01:29:12,220 --> 01:29:15,820
but I'll say that you used your reaction for him earlier.

1844
01:29:15,820 --> 01:29:16,660
So roll a D6.

1845
01:29:16,660 --> 01:29:18,260
- Yeah, 'cause I can use, I can reduce the damage

1846
01:29:18,260 --> 01:29:19,100
that any of my friends take.

1847
01:29:19,100 --> 01:29:20,460
- So roll a D6, roll a D6.

1848
01:29:20,460 --> 01:29:25,180
We'll retroactively do this. I mean, I got so fucking bitch made right now.

1849
01:29:25,180 --> 01:29:26,180
I got a three.

1850
01:29:26,180 --> 01:29:28,940
All right, so you are at four then, HP.

1851
01:29:28,940 --> 01:29:29,940
Okay.

1852
01:29:29,940 --> 01:29:31,980
But I have no, I can't do anything.

1853
01:29:31,980 --> 01:29:32,980
Get him. Get him.

1854
01:29:32,980 --> 01:29:34,980
I've been completely fucking, I am totally solid right now.

1855
01:29:34,980 --> 01:29:37,340
I need everyone to blow on this stuff.

1856
01:29:37,340 --> 01:29:40,460
This is the worst day, a worst day of my life.

1857
01:29:40,460 --> 01:29:42,020
Come on, get him.

1858
01:29:42,020 --> 01:29:43,020
Damn, fuck.

1859
01:29:43,020 --> 01:29:45,380
All right, then this time, don't blow on it.

1860
01:29:45,380 --> 01:29:46,380
Okay.

1861
01:29:46,380 --> 01:29:47,380
Actually, you blow on it.

1862
01:29:47,380 --> 01:29:48,380
Blow on it.

1863
01:29:48,380 --> 01:29:49,380
Go ahead.

1864
01:29:49,380 --> 01:29:50,380
Blow on it now.

1865
01:29:50,380 --> 01:29:55,140
I blow on it's going to get it.

1866
01:29:55,140 --> 01:29:57,740
Oh,

1867
01:29:57,740 --> 01:30:03,780
close okay, fifteen or twenty, I guess all right, you're up top of the order,

1868
01:30:03,780 --> 01:30:05,220
okay, I'm yoke shouting him.

1869
01:30:05,220 --> 01:30:13,100
That's a twelve nope, he's up running out of yoke, I'm looking very thin and

1870
01:30:13,100 --> 01:30:14,660
ring, he's going to try to strangle you.

1871
01:30:14,660 --> 01:30:20,220
Is that you trying to strangle me or is that you think it is me, what do you

1872
01:30:20,220 --> 01:30:23,180
I think that it's you personally. Can I jump in front of it?

1873
01:30:23,180 --> 01:30:29,220
What if the entire airport becomes like a world war Z mob and they're all

1874
01:30:29,220 --> 01:30:32,140
defending me like a giant human? I would like to jump in front of the

1875
01:30:32,140 --> 01:30:32,660
strangle.

1876
01:30:32,660 --> 01:30:39,180
You know, I mean, I don't know. I don't want to be like a poo poo guy.

1877
01:30:39,180 --> 01:30:42,420
You know, I'm saying no, he can't do that fine. All right, what is he?

1878
01:30:42,420 --> 01:30:47,260
He does strangle you, so all that is I roll a dex thing or no

1879
01:30:48,620 --> 01:30:51,020
Here's what's happening, when you're strangled,

1880
01:30:51,020 --> 01:30:52,260
what's your con modifier?

1881
01:30:52,260 --> 01:30:54,600
Okay, okay, this is tough.

1882
01:30:54,600 --> 01:30:59,140
You have one round or you're gonna be at zero.

1883
01:30:59,140 --> 01:31:01,740
The way that strangulation works

1884
01:31:01,740 --> 01:31:04,340
or suffocation works in 5E,

1885
01:31:04,340 --> 01:31:06,480
you can hold your breath for however many minutes,

1886
01:31:06,480 --> 01:31:07,780
there's a rule for that,

1887
01:31:07,780 --> 01:31:11,540
but for suffocation, it's your modifier,

1888
01:31:11,540 --> 01:31:13,580
your con modifier is how many rounds

1889
01:31:13,580 --> 01:31:15,540
you can be suffocating, quote, unquote.

1890
01:31:15,540 --> 01:31:16,900
So you're considered suffocating, yeah.

1891
01:31:16,900 --> 01:31:18,360
And you're zero, so I'm gonna give you one.

1892
01:31:18,360 --> 01:31:24,680
I think it's dumb to be like, he strangles you and you immediately pass out.

1893
01:31:24,680 --> 01:31:26,160
So this is your last chance at this.

1894
01:31:26,160 --> 01:31:28,200
Okay, well we gotta go through the border one more time.

1895
01:31:28,200 --> 01:31:29,200
Pat has a turn.

1896
01:31:29,200 --> 01:31:30,200
Okay.

1897
01:31:30,200 --> 01:31:35,520
And he's close to me?

1898
01:31:35,520 --> 01:31:36,520
I'm gonna pee on him.

1899
01:31:36,520 --> 01:31:40,280
If you do that he could slip, that could change things.

1900
01:31:40,280 --> 01:31:42,200
So hold on, he's gotta roll against that.

1901
01:31:42,200 --> 01:31:43,200
Okay.

1902
01:31:43,200 --> 01:31:44,200
He's got very high dex.

1903
01:31:44,200 --> 01:31:45,200
You're not rolling anything.

1904
01:31:45,200 --> 01:31:46,200
Alright.

1905
01:31:46,200 --> 01:31:47,200
Oh, man!

1906
01:31:47,200 --> 01:31:48,200
Fuck.

1907
01:31:48,200 --> 01:31:55,200
You got a two. You got a two. So he's gonna be knocked prone. Oh my god. So he drops you.

1908
01:31:55,200 --> 01:32:03,960
Oh shit. Oh I didn't, ow! You have to pay me for that. Oh my god. I get paid in the hundred

1909
01:32:03,960 --> 01:32:10,600
thousands to pee on man. Beast mode. Beast mode dude. A million feet in the air this time.

1910
01:32:10,600 --> 01:32:14,920
I'm gonna keep giving you advantage. You now legitimately have advantage. A billion feet in

1911
01:32:14,920 --> 01:32:18,160
in the air. Please prone. He's not prone. We also you're just

1912
01:32:18,160 --> 01:32:22,880
destroying this airport. Oh my God. Okay. This is the final

1913
01:32:22,880 --> 01:32:28,040
try. If you don't get this, we lose. We don't know that. What

1914
01:32:28,040 --> 01:32:29,400
if I survive the next attack?

1915
01:32:29,400 --> 01:32:33,080
So this probably isn't my final try. So I'm just gonna throw it

1916
01:32:33,080 --> 01:32:33,520
on you care.

1917
01:32:33,520 --> 01:32:35,640
Fuck.

1918
01:32:35,640 --> 01:32:38,400
All right, wait, but that's doubles. It's monopoly rules. I

1919
01:32:38,400 --> 01:32:39,160
get to roll again.

1920
01:32:39,160 --> 01:32:43,440
All right, back to the top of the order. Okay, I'm yo

1921
01:32:43,440 --> 01:32:49,120
The yolk shot comes out of my ween.

1922
01:32:49,120 --> 01:32:50,120
That's not a hit.

1923
01:32:50,120 --> 01:32:51,120
Nope.

1924
01:32:51,120 --> 01:32:52,120
He's up.

1925
01:32:52,120 --> 01:32:53,120
He's up?

1926
01:32:53,120 --> 01:32:54,800
Yeah, he's up.

1927
01:32:54,800 --> 01:32:55,800
Up from prone?

1928
01:32:55,800 --> 01:32:57,200
Well, yeah, he gets up.

1929
01:32:57,200 --> 01:32:58,600
That only takes half his movement.

1930
01:32:58,600 --> 01:33:00,920
Wait, do I get advantage or something if he's prone?

1931
01:33:00,920 --> 01:33:03,560
Well, no, because yolk shot's a ranged attack.

1932
01:33:03,560 --> 01:33:04,560
Okay.

1933
01:33:04,560 --> 01:33:05,640
So he's going to get up.

1934
01:33:05,640 --> 01:33:08,240
He's not prone from being not prone.

1935
01:33:08,240 --> 01:33:11,760
He's going to try to strangle you this time.

1936
01:33:11,760 --> 01:33:13,040
You got to pay me to do that!

1937
01:33:13,040 --> 01:33:31,480
you

1938
01:33:31,480 --> 01:33:36,280
though yeah you can't do anything besides try to get out of this right now I start

1939
01:33:36,280 --> 01:33:41,120
pissing you can do that I guess all right I didn't think about that that's pretty

1940
01:33:41,120 --> 01:33:57,560
dumb of me yeah I gotta let you fucking piss yourself oh fuck man he slips again

1941
01:33:57,560 --> 01:34:04,600
It's like the scene in the movie when the blood goes towards his shoe and he moves

1942
01:34:04,600 --> 01:34:13,760
his shoe but it's pee. He's just going like oh no. All right. Oh my god. Oh my god.

1943
01:34:13,760 --> 01:34:19,440
I can't believe you made him slip again. Come on. 15. Dude we are so close. How many 15s in 14?

1944
01:34:19,440 --> 01:34:23,560
Come on we got this. We got this. We got this. Drop on him. A trillion feet. A

1945
01:34:23,560 --> 01:34:25,560
A trillion feet in the air.

1946
01:34:25,560 --> 01:34:27,560
God damn it, dude.

1947
01:34:27,560 --> 01:34:28,560
Oh my god, dude.

1948
01:34:28,560 --> 01:34:29,560
Dude, I suck at this.

1949
01:34:29,560 --> 01:34:31,560
You're really bad. You should let me roll it next time.

1950
01:34:31,560 --> 01:34:32,560
You're out.

1951
01:34:32,560 --> 01:34:34,560
I'm Yolkshaw.

1952
01:34:34,560 --> 01:34:35,560
Why do you keep doing that?

1953
01:34:35,560 --> 01:34:37,560
I hit him this time, I think. That's 22.

1954
01:34:37,560 --> 01:34:38,560
That does hit him.

1955
01:34:38,560 --> 01:34:39,560
Okay.

1956
01:34:39,560 --> 01:34:40,560
Okay, now I know why you keep doing that.

1957
01:34:40,560 --> 01:34:44,560
I mean, the damage doesn't really matter, but now attacks on him have advantage.

1958
01:34:44,560 --> 01:34:45,560
That's true.

1959
01:34:45,560 --> 01:34:46,560
That's seven damage.

1960
01:34:46,560 --> 01:34:48,560
Okay, I was giving him advantage already.

1961
01:34:48,560 --> 01:34:50,560
The yolk's going in his mouth.

1962
01:34:50,560 --> 01:34:51,560
Alright.

1963
01:34:51,560 --> 01:34:52,560
I peed on him!

1964
01:34:52,560 --> 01:34:55,560
And now he's got a yoke in him!

1965
01:34:55,560 --> 01:34:56,560
Alright, he's gonna-

1966
01:34:56,560 --> 01:34:58,080
Lursell doesn't give up!

1967
01:34:58,080 --> 01:35:01,560
He's going to try to attack you again, Cam.

1968
01:35:01,560 --> 01:35:02,560
Fuck.

1969
01:35:02,560 --> 01:35:05,080
Music to my ears.

1970
01:35:05,080 --> 01:35:06,080
I hate this game.

1971
01:35:06,080 --> 01:35:07,080
Alright, you're up.

1972
01:35:07,080 --> 01:35:09,560
This is the longest fight we've ever been in.

1973
01:35:09,560 --> 01:35:10,560
So I'm gonna use-

1974
01:35:10,560 --> 01:35:11,560
I'm just waiting on one roll.

1975
01:35:11,560 --> 01:35:14,560
I'm gonna use Defender Egg on myself.

1976
01:35:14,560 --> 01:35:17,560
No, as a reaction to damage you take.

1977
01:35:17,560 --> 01:35:19,560
Oh, right, and I can only use it five per long rest.

1978
01:35:19,560 --> 01:35:20,560
Okay.

1979
01:35:20,560 --> 01:35:22,560
Well, I took damage because he was strangling me.

1980
01:35:22,560 --> 01:35:24,560
No, you didn't take any damage.

1981
01:35:24,560 --> 01:35:26,560
Oh, right, right, right.

1982
01:35:26,560 --> 01:35:28,560
And I'm still at full health.

1983
01:35:28,560 --> 01:35:30,560
There's things you can do.

1984
01:35:30,560 --> 01:35:34,560
So in 5e, if you want to tell me what you want to do to make it easier for him,

1985
01:35:34,560 --> 01:35:38,560
describe it to me, we can figure out what the checks are for that, and then it can work.

1986
01:35:38,560 --> 01:35:40,560
I mean, I'm an old century egg.

1987
01:35:40,560 --> 01:35:42,560
That's right.

1988
01:35:42,560 --> 01:35:44,560
They're very elastic.

1989
01:35:44,560 --> 01:35:46,560
Okay, what are you thinking?

1990
01:35:46,560 --> 01:35:48,560
I've heard that too.

1991
01:35:48,560 --> 01:35:51,280
Century eggs are very elastic and rubbery.

1992
01:35:51,280 --> 01:35:58,280
So I just lay down and I say, "Jump on me like a trampoline.

1993
01:35:58,280 --> 01:36:03,320
I'm going to turn into an egg trampoline."

1994
01:36:03,320 --> 01:36:04,600
I don't really need extra height.

1995
01:36:04,600 --> 01:36:06,240
You could go a billion feet.

1996
01:36:06,240 --> 01:36:07,240
I can already jump.

1997
01:36:07,240 --> 01:36:12,040
Are you going to jump a billion feet in the air for one billion dollars?

1998
01:36:12,040 --> 01:36:14,000
I lie down on the ground too.

1999
01:36:14,000 --> 01:36:15,680
Is that a mechanic in Dungeons and Dragons?

2000
01:36:15,680 --> 01:36:16,680
It's not.

2001
01:36:16,680 --> 01:36:20,040
And like again, I'm embarrassed.

2002
01:36:20,040 --> 01:36:21,280
I'm thinking I got triple advantage.

2003
01:36:21,280 --> 01:36:22,280
That means it's triple advantage.

2004
01:36:22,280 --> 01:36:26,160
Well, I already gave, I already yolk shot it, so you should have quadruple advantage.

2005
01:36:26,160 --> 01:36:27,160
No.

2006
01:36:27,160 --> 01:36:28,160
Yeah, he has quadruple advantage.

2007
01:36:28,160 --> 01:36:29,160
We cut it at triple, but.

2008
01:36:29,160 --> 01:36:33,200
Please, because then you ruin it for the audience at home.

2009
01:36:33,200 --> 01:36:34,200
Here I go.

2010
01:36:34,200 --> 01:36:35,200
This has got to be it, right?

2011
01:36:35,200 --> 01:36:36,200
This is going to be it.

2012
01:36:36,200 --> 01:36:37,200
I guess that's a six.

2013
01:36:37,200 --> 01:36:38,200
I knew it wasn't that one.

2014
01:36:38,200 --> 01:36:39,200
That's why I didn't go the whole way around.

2015
01:36:39,200 --> 01:36:40,200
Yeah, no, it's going to be the next.

2016
01:36:40,200 --> 01:36:43,640
What we meant when we said it's going to be it is it's important.

2017
01:36:43,640 --> 01:36:44,640
It's not going to be this one.

2018
01:36:44,640 --> 01:36:45,800
So don't even care about this one.

2019
01:36:45,800 --> 01:36:48,040
I mean, like, statistically, it has to be this one.

2020
01:36:48,040 --> 01:36:49,900
(ball bouncing)

2021
01:36:49,900 --> 01:36:50,740
Dis two.

2022
01:36:50,740 --> 01:36:51,560
(laughing)

2023
01:36:51,560 --> 01:36:52,400
All right, guys.

2024
01:36:52,400 --> 01:36:53,240
- Statistically.

2025
01:36:53,240 --> 01:36:54,060
- Oh my God.

2026
01:36:54,060 --> 01:36:55,680
- What is wrong about my technique right now?

2027
01:36:55,680 --> 01:36:57,420
- Can I just get on the plane?

2028
01:36:57,420 --> 01:36:59,100
- I mean, you guys can run away whenever you want.

2029
01:36:59,100 --> 01:37:01,400
- All right, if this one doesn't hit, I'm running away.

2030
01:37:01,400 --> 01:37:02,240
- Me too.

2031
01:37:02,240 --> 01:37:03,740
- Okay, can we call it at that?

2032
01:37:03,740 --> 01:37:04,580
- Yeah.

2033
01:37:04,580 --> 01:37:05,400
- All right.

2034
01:37:05,400 --> 01:37:06,240
- Jump on my vagina.

2035
01:37:06,240 --> 01:37:07,080
(laughing)

2036
01:37:07,080 --> 01:37:09,880
- I'm gonna jump on your vagina very shortly.

2037
01:37:09,880 --> 01:37:11,380
- That's what's gonna say, but.

2038
01:37:11,380 --> 01:37:14,700
My butt-gina.

2039
01:37:14,700 --> 01:37:16,700
God is real, God is real, God is real.

2040
01:37:16,700 --> 01:37:17,540
(laughter)

2041
01:37:17,540 --> 01:37:19,380
- There's an angel looking at me.

2042
01:37:19,380 --> 01:37:22,620
- Christ died for all my sins.

2043
