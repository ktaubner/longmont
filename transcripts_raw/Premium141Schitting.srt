00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:53,560

00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:54,560
Ben, it doesn't work like that.

44
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:55,560
You keep saying two different things.

00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:56,560

I guess they're not twins.

00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:16,560
Wait, do you think we could get them to talk to each other?

56
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:18,560

00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:20,560
We have to make this happen.

58
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:22,560
You have to get him off the phone and get him started.

00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:24,560
Oh true, yeah.

00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:26,560

00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:32,880
Why do you have an iPad? You're a child. It's the funniest thing to have on an iPad. Get a Microsoft Surface.

00:03:57,640 --> 00:04:03,200
It's like Flappy Bird. I'm sorry. I'm so upset. Is CamWow gone? CamWow does not work with the

95
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:12,540
- Because I just got--

96
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:13,940
- I used to load, yeah, I'd listen,

97
00:05:13,940 --> 00:05:16,380
I'd load like two albums on and I'd just listen to those

98
00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:18,060
and I'd like change it up every week or something.

99
00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:18,900
- Yeah, exactly.

100
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:21,620
- My mom was obsessed with online giveaways.

101
00:05:21,620 --> 00:05:22,460
- Yeah.

102
00:05:22,460 --> 00:05:23,620
- And-- - I think I got my iPod

103
00:05:23,620 --> 00:05:24,500
shuffle for free.

104
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:26,260
- That's how my mom got one,

105
00:05:26,260 --> 00:05:29,780
she got a blue iPod shuffle through an Oreo giveaway.

106
00:05:29,780 --> 00:05:31,100
And on the back of the clip,

107
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:32,740
it was like the third generation one,

108
00:05:32,740 --> 00:05:33,700
the one that had a clip.

109
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:34,540
- Yeah.

110
00:05:34,540 --> 00:05:35,360
- And on the back of it,

111
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:37,460
it just had the word Oreo engraved into it.

112
00:05:37,460 --> 00:05:38,860
- That is so sick. - That's so tight.

113
00:05:38,860 --> 00:05:40,060
- Yeah, and then my brother,

114
00:05:40,060 --> 00:05:41,620
my little brother, she gives it to my little brother

115
00:05:41,620 --> 00:05:45,980
because I already had my sister's old orange iPod Nano,

116
00:05:45,980 --> 00:05:48,580
and he ran it through the fucking wash.

117
00:05:48,580 --> 00:05:50,460
- My big brother used to threaten to eat mine.

118
00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:51,300
- Yeah.

119
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:52,860
- He was so small, he'd be like,

120
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:54,100
I'm gonna, he was mad at me,

121
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:55,580
he'd be like, I'm gonna eat your iPod Shuffle.

122
00:05:55,580 --> 00:05:56,400
- Wow.

123
00:05:56,400 --> 00:06:00,100
I won a giveaway on Twitter once

124
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:03,020
when I was in freshman year of high school.

125
00:06:03,020 --> 00:06:05,980
I won a whole complete cruiser board.

126
00:06:05,980 --> 00:06:06,820
- What's that?

127
00:06:06,820 --> 00:06:07,900
A whole complete?

128
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:09,020
- A whole complete one.

129
00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:10,140
- An entire whole--

130
00:06:10,140 --> 00:06:13,060
- Like trucks, wheels, a whole complete.

131
00:06:13,060 --> 00:06:15,100
- Is that the brand name?

132
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:15,940
- No, no, no, no.

133
00:06:15,940 --> 00:06:18,020
- You're just saying you want an entire

134
00:06:18,020 --> 00:06:20,700
complete, full, total board.

135
00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:21,540
- A complete board, yeah,

136
00:06:21,540 --> 00:06:24,220
'cause I could've just won a deck or something.

137
00:06:24,220 --> 00:06:25,640
- But just say you want a skateboard.

138
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:27,020
- Yeah, I could've said that.

139
00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:31,860
But I won a cruiser board 'cause I knew

140
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:34,500
a trick that Rodney Mullin invented.

141
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:36,380
- Was it the-- - Through CCS.

142
00:06:36,380 --> 00:06:37,500
- Was it a backflip?

143
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:38,340
- No.

144
00:06:38,340 --> 00:06:39,500
- CCS.

145
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:41,700
It was Ollie Airwalk or something.

146
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:44,620
- I think the only giveaway I ever won

147
00:06:44,620 --> 00:06:46,740
was an online giveaway for movie tickets

148
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:50,300
to the 2020 remake of The Grudge.

149
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:53,140
It was like the worst movie I ever saw in my life.

150
00:06:53,140 --> 00:06:54,260
It was so, it was crazy.

151
00:06:54,260 --> 00:06:56,380
- That was a cool giveaway to win.

152
00:06:56,380 --> 00:06:58,500
But then I tried to, 'cause it was like a,

153
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:02,940
like a little kicktail, like cruiser board.

154
00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:04,700
I tried to-- - A whole entire one.

155
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:05,540
- Whole entire one.

156
00:07:05,540 --> 00:07:08,140
- But it didn't have any wheels or anything.

157
00:07:08,140 --> 00:07:08,980
- No, I had to.

158
00:07:08,980 --> 00:07:09,800
- But it was, it had the wheels,

159
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:11,020
but it was just half of the board.

160
00:07:11,020 --> 00:07:11,860
- Right.

161
00:07:11,860 --> 00:07:14,540
- I won that and then I didn't like the graphic on it.

162
00:07:14,540 --> 00:07:15,480
The graphic was literally,

163
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:17,580
it was a triangle with sunglasses.

164
00:07:17,580 --> 00:07:18,420
- That's sick.

165
00:07:18,420 --> 00:07:19,240
- That's cool.

166
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:20,480
- And I sanded it off.

167
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:21,320
- Whoa.

168
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:22,700
- And then like I forgot about it

169
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:24,360
and then it started raining or something

170
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:26,900
and then like it was just completely waterlogged.

171
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:28,140
- Completely entirely.

172
00:07:28,140 --> 00:07:29,580
- I'm gonna waterlog you.

173
00:07:29,580 --> 00:07:30,400
- Better not.

174
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:32,380
- I'm gonna fill up your porous body with water.

175
00:07:32,380 --> 00:07:33,220
- Better not.

176
00:07:33,220 --> 00:07:34,740
- You're gonna be fully saturated with water

177
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:36,180
by the time I'm done.

178
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:38,020
- I'm working on that already.

179
00:07:38,020 --> 00:07:42,980
Whoa. I've been, uh, I've been dedicated to becoming hydrated all the time.

180
00:07:42,980 --> 00:07:45,860
Yeah. It's like I really scared about my kidneys.

181
00:07:45,860 --> 00:07:49,620
Your kidneys. It's hard to be hydrated all the time because you have to pee.

182
00:07:49,620 --> 00:07:54,340
So I wake up three times a night. It's so annoying. I hate peeing.

183
00:07:54,340 --> 00:07:57,060
It hurts. I know. I know. The end. Yeah.

184
00:07:57,060 --> 00:08:00,700
The end of peeing hurts every time. Yeah. A little bit. No,

185
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:01,860
I don't think that's true.

186
00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:05,020
Every time at the end when you have to push out the little last bit and then it

187
00:08:05,020 --> 00:08:09,560
hurts a little bit I'm drinking Evian because I saw water sommelier say that

00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:14,360
exactly the same they make it they make up fake stuff like you to buy water

201
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:18,680
bottle the only one that is not the same is Nestle and Dasani no honey is

202
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:21,440
bullshit honestly tastes like it has cream in it

203
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:26,080
Dasani they literally put salt in it that's fine I don't give a fuck yeah

207
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:44,480
exactly all the water is the same all water it is exactly the same yeah it's

208
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:49,320
completely safe it's not it is not all water is the same it is you're not

209
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:54,400
giving a single water ample yeah and it was fine in his tan suit he's fine

210
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:56,400
Obama drank that damn water in his tan suit.

211
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:57,200
And did he die?

212
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:57,700
No.

213
00:09:57,700 --> 00:09:58,200
Yes, they replaced him.

214
00:09:58,200 --> 00:09:59,200
He was completely fine.

215
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:00,200
They did not replace him.

216
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:03,700
They replaced him with a different, they replaced him with an impersonator who had gray hair.

217
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:04,200
You're wrong.

218
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:04,700
Michelle Obama is...

219
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:08,200
He replaced everybody else with impersonators and that's what the problem with the government is.

220
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:15,000
Barack and Michelle were basically a, like, a prestige situation where anytime the Obama would die,

221
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,700
they'd replace him with the Michelle who was a man and they'd shave his head.

222
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:19,200
Yeah.

223
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:22,700
And then they'd get the new Michelle from one of the clone tubes.

224
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:23,200
Uh-huh.

225
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:27,200
and then that'd be the new Michelle. Also all clone tube liquid is the same.

226
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:30,160
Yeah, it's all just people say like oh some of it's like oh this one has more

227
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:36,080
clone nutrients. It's like no it's not. So and honestly the best the best clone

228
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:40,640
tube liquid comes from Flint. Actually yeah. That's why the water there is

229
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:44,800
is so colorful. Oh man this tastes so different from Dasani.

230
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:49,120
Can you imagine making like a like a nice like pasta dish in Flint, Michigan?

231
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:52,720
I just feel like it's got so much like well all that that brown stuff boils out.

232
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:59,680
yeah it's like alcohol was it there like flint is it like the the water turns on

233
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:05,200
you could light the water on fire was is that the problem was that water there on fire or

234
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:10,000
you think now you think of the the gulf of mexico during the bp oils oh okay yeah yeah

235
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,840
that was a cool video guy turns on the tap puts a little like the

236
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:21,280
oh is that where the water that's where the water is controlled by people in robes yes or my i might

237
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:24,980
typey thing of the water nation. Oh, I don't remember from avatar. The last

238
00:11:24,980 --> 00:11:29,380
airbender was I think the real water. I think it's milk and honey in flint.

239
00:11:29,380 --> 00:11:33,660
That was a problem yeah. That was the in the Bible. They say the rivers flow

240
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:39,820
with milk and honey in Israel, I think, and it's like what how about water and

241
00:11:39,820 --> 00:11:43,780
no wonder they are going to issue water yeah. You fucking spent three thousand

242
00:11:43,780 --> 00:11:48,900
hundred eating drinking milk and honey. Where's the milk come from to the river?

243
00:11:48,900 --> 00:11:50,380
The fuck is that

244
00:11:50,380 --> 00:11:56,020
Is there some big cow just squirting into the top of a man? I mean that's that's

245
00:11:56,020 --> 00:11:59,980
probably the closest thing you can get besides medicine to just a diarrhea

246
00:11:59,980 --> 00:12:06,980
inducer milk and honey. I feel ever from a river yeah mixed yeah, yeah, that's

247
00:12:06,980 --> 00:12:11,620
gross. Oh, it's a fracking thing. Wait, my fracking hate what you're talking

248
00:12:11,620 --> 00:12:12,060

00:12:29,140 --> 00:12:31,980
Yeah, the water in America is all fucked.

00:12:35,340 --> 00:12:37,260
It's like why everybody's like this here.

completely no one has ever died of cancer up there yeah the food oh here's

276
00:13:22,860 --> 00:13:25,460
an idea I was having this morning I was thinking about McDonald's and I was like

277
00:13:25,460 --> 00:13:30,160
I love McDonald's but I'd never am like unless I'm like drunk I never want

278
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:34,740
McDonald's after like five o'clock so you need to have a like a McDinner menu

279
00:13:34,740 --> 00:13:43,100
they do but it's like like like you can get like a steak I think hamburgers a

280
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:47,140
lunch meal. What about like a chopped sirloin at McDonald's? Yeah like

281
00:13:47,140 --> 00:13:52,340
something like that. Okay like like gravy with mushrooms. Yeah. Over just like

282
00:13:52,340 --> 00:13:56,960
big mac quarter pounder patties. Turkey dinner. Maybe a mac and cheese side. Yeah. You know. Or like a

283
00:13:56,960 --> 00:14:03,020
big red velvet cake. And here's the other thing. They have those in other countries at

284
00:14:03,020 --> 00:14:08,300
McDonald's. I know it's fucked. Like McDonald's in Italy? Yeah. Don't even

285
00:14:08,300 --> 00:14:11,380
don't even think about it. That's the most. Don't even think about it. That's the most.

286
00:14:11,380 --> 00:14:13,040
- Don't even think about it.

287
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:13,880
- Don't even think about it.

288
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:16,460
- It's the most divine cuisine.

289
00:14:16,460 --> 00:14:17,300
- It's fine cuisine.

290
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:18,140
- It's divine cuisine.

291
00:14:18,140 --> 00:14:18,980
- You don't even have to think about it.

292
00:14:18,980 --> 00:14:19,820
- Don't even think about it.

293
00:14:19,820 --> 00:14:22,020
- It's divine cuisine, that's what I said.

294
00:14:22,020 --> 00:14:23,340
- Don't even think about it.

295
00:14:23,340 --> 00:14:25,660
- But we need a McDonald's dinner menu

296
00:14:25,660 --> 00:14:27,300
that they don't start serving,

297
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:29,140
you know what they should do at McDonald's?

298
00:14:29,140 --> 00:14:31,200
They should close for one hour,

299
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:32,340
between four o'clock and five o'clock.

300
00:14:32,340 --> 00:14:33,740
- Yeah, oh my God.

301
00:14:33,740 --> 00:14:35,560
- Right, then they reopen.

302
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:37,420
- That, I mean, that's what it's like

303
00:14:37,420 --> 00:14:39,140
everywhere in other countries?

304
00:14:39,140 --> 00:14:39,980
- Every other country.

305
00:14:39,980 --> 00:14:43,980
other McDonald's is like every store and restaurant does that right?

306
00:14:43,980 --> 00:14:44,980
Mm-hmm.

307
00:14:44,980 --> 00:14:45,980
In other countries?

308
00:14:45,980 --> 00:14:47,980
They do it in some restaurants.

309
00:14:47,980 --> 00:14:49,980
Oh yeah, but that's because they're mimicking.

310
00:14:49,980 --> 00:14:50,980
But I just mean in general.

311
00:14:50,980 --> 00:14:51,980
Like you can't.

312
00:14:51,980 --> 00:14:52,980
Yeah, dinner, like a...

313
00:14:52,980 --> 00:14:57,580
Like even I feel like it may be like in Europe a hardware store would close from like, yeah,

314
00:14:57,580 --> 00:14:59,980
like four to six and then it's like the fancier tools.

315
00:14:59,980 --> 00:15:03,460
Yeah, guys probably, well in Europe it probably has to do with they're all fucking addicted

316
00:15:03,460 --> 00:15:04,460
to drugs.

317
00:15:04,460 --> 00:15:07,260
Yeah, and then it's probably because they need to take naps too.

318
00:15:07,260 --> 00:15:08,260
Yeah.

319
00:15:08,260 --> 00:15:09,260
McDonald's and those.

320
00:15:09,260 --> 00:15:14,260
I'm so I had to work two hours from twelve to four. I need a two hour nap. I

321
00:15:14,260 --> 00:15:18,060

325
00:15:31,660 --> 00:15:36,960

326
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:41,760
grill on the roof. Okay, but yeah, the year these Europeans man they take

327
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:46,360
they're so lazy six months off. Yeah, it's up to what to braid your women's armpit

331
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:02,760
adopt a you more. You're not an animal. It's like many women are so bohemian in

332
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:07,520
Europe it's like I see I see an entire I see kind of so much hair on their body

333
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:12,280
and yet a shaved or very shortly cropped head of hair yep mm-hmm I was just

haircut buzzcut yeah I'm trying to see that kind of a I want to just experience

336
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:26,200
I want to even some Korean French Spanish Italian women your hair is long

337
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:30,120
in the wrong places yeah it's supposed to be long on top of the head.

338
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:32,920
You have a boy haircut, Isabella Rossellini.

339
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:35,880
You're supposed to have a little black tower.

340
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:37,120
Supposed to have long hair.

341
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:40,600
Emerging from your vagina and no hair anywhere else.

342
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:41,520
Yeah.

343
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:42,360
You know?

344
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:44,720
And instead you got a spider web butthole

345
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:47,360
and your fucking leg hair's insane.

346
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:48,560
You look like a carpet.

347
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:51,200
You're fucking, you're shaving a Jordan logo

348
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:53,600
into your calf hair over there in France.

349
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:55,000
Stop that.

350
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,680
Knock that shit off.

351
00:16:56,680 --> 00:16:57,520
That's bullshit.

352
00:16:57,520 --> 00:16:58,680
Get rid of the smell.

353
00:16:58,680 --> 00:16:59,520
Yeah.

354
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:04,360
They go to the barber, women in France go to the barber just to get a fade up on their legs.

355
00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:05,360
Yeah, that's true.

356
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:06,360
And their arms.

357
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:09,000
They like getting it so the ankle has no hair and then it fades up.

358
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,000
It fades up.

359
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,520
It fades up into just the most Sasquatchian woman.

360
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:13,520
Just disgusting, dude.

361
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:14,520
Yeah.

362
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:15,520
Yeah.

363
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:16,520
Women in Europe.

364
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:17,520
And I would hate seeing all that.

365
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:18,520
I don't like that.

366
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:21,420
Women here, they'll walk, they'll go to the mall, they'll walk through the perfume section

367
00:17:21,420 --> 00:17:26,100
at the store and they'll get all these sample aromas sprayed on their wrist.

368
00:17:26,100 --> 00:17:30,060
And I mean in Europe, these women are going out behind the mall, they're walking by the

369
00:17:30,060 --> 00:17:33,500
dumpster, they're rubbing cardboard, banana peels.

370
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:34,500
That's right.

371
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:35,500
And they eat snails.

372
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:38,420
And the women who walk by the perfume at the mall, a lot of times here in America, the

373
00:17:38,420 --> 00:17:41,540
good country, a lot of times they pass out because they haven't eaten all day like they're

374
00:17:41,540 --> 00:17:42,540
supposed to.

375
00:17:42,540 --> 00:17:43,540
Yeah.

376
00:17:43,540 --> 00:17:46,580
Which is that women should not eat a single meal.

377
00:17:46,580 --> 00:17:53,780
Most women don't walk by the perfume counter, they drive by it on their rover scooter.

378
00:17:53,780 --> 00:17:54,780
What?

379
00:17:54,780 --> 00:17:56,340
What is it called?

380
00:17:56,340 --> 00:17:57,340
Rascal scooter.

381
00:17:57,340 --> 00:18:00,380
Most women in America are driving around on a rascal scooter.

382
00:18:00,380 --> 00:18:04,380
No, women in America are beautiful and they shouldn't eat a single meal.

383
00:18:04,380 --> 00:18:07,460
They should eat one meal every other day and they should have no hair except for their

384
00:18:07,460 --> 00:18:08,460
head.

385
00:18:08,460 --> 00:18:09,460
Eyebrows, eyelashes.

386
00:18:09,460 --> 00:18:12,340
No but and giant boobs.

387
00:18:12,340 --> 00:18:16,020
No but at all, the giantest boobs of all time.

388
00:18:16,020 --> 00:18:17,020
That's America.

389
00:18:17,020 --> 00:18:21,180
And they should all wear that Spike TV as a thousand ways to die model.

390
00:18:21,180 --> 00:18:24,340
France and Italy on the other hand, the women are cross-eyed, right?

391
00:18:24,340 --> 00:18:29,300
They have a fucking, they have half of a, they have a torpedo sticking out of their head.

392
00:18:29,300 --> 00:18:30,300
Yeah.

393
00:18:30,300 --> 00:18:31,300
Right?

394
00:18:31,300 --> 00:18:32,300
They have an eye patch.

395
00:18:32,300 --> 00:18:35,460
They have a giant, a giant mustache, right?

396
00:18:35,460 --> 00:18:37,780
They look like Ron Burgundy from fucking Anchorman.

397
00:18:37,780 --> 00:18:38,780
Yeah.

398
00:18:38,780 --> 00:18:39,780
Right?

399
00:18:39,780 --> 00:18:40,780
But they're not nearly as funny.

400
00:18:40,780 --> 00:18:41,780
Okay.

401
00:18:41,780 --> 00:18:42,780
No, no.

402
00:18:42,780 --> 00:18:45,940
And then you have all these, all these women walking around there and also, oh fuck, what's

403
00:18:45,940 --> 00:18:46,940
going on?

404
00:18:46,940 --> 00:18:48,460
There's a nuclear war in fucking Ukraine.

405
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:50,260
What am I going to do?

406
00:18:50,260 --> 00:18:52,420
I'm going to show my hairy boobs of the world.

407
00:18:52,420 --> 00:18:53,420
Yeah.

408
00:18:53,420 --> 00:18:57,420
Exactly. I think that did work though. I haven't heard a thing about Ukraine in months.

409
00:18:57,420 --> 00:19:02,180
No, that actually did work because all the Ukrainian and Russian soldiers saw us sort

410
00:19:02,180 --> 00:19:06,900
of vomiting because of all the hair on the women that were completely showing their boobs.

411
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:10,620
Well, it makes sense to have that much hair in Russia because it's so damn cold there

412
00:19:10,620 --> 00:19:11,620
because it's always snowing.

413
00:19:11,620 --> 00:19:15,380
I don't care if it makes sense. Women's bodies are not supposed to make sense. Here's just

414
00:19:15,380 --> 00:19:16,380
to please me.

415
00:19:16,380 --> 00:19:17,380
That's a good point.

416
00:19:17,380 --> 00:19:23,380
Women in Europe too, I mean, you'll see them riding around bicycles just pedaling there.

417
00:19:23,380 --> 00:19:24,380
- It's a man's vehicle.

418
00:19:24,380 --> 00:19:25,380
- Their heart's out.

419
00:19:25,380 --> 00:19:28,580
It's like, well, what are you trying, you know you're riding, they don't even need to get

420
00:19:28,580 --> 00:19:29,580
anywhere.

421
00:19:29,580 --> 00:19:30,940
They're just trying to kind of cultivate a funk.

422
00:19:30,940 --> 00:19:33,780
They're trying to get this sweat to beat up in their crisscross hairs.

423
00:19:33,780 --> 00:19:36,140
- Luckily, most of the bicycles are only for guys.

424
00:19:36,140 --> 00:19:41,240
- You know what the leading cause of death among female cyclists is in France is actually

425
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:43,740
their mustache hairs getting caught in the gears.

426
00:19:43,740 --> 00:19:45,620
And then they do a complete front flip.

427
00:19:45,620 --> 00:19:46,620
- Women are so sure I am the dark knight.

428
00:19:46,620 --> 00:19:52,120
- These women cyclists in Europe, they're trying to look like a calm and placid morning

429
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:56,000
in the meadow with dew drops built up all over these blades of grass all over

430
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:59,160
their bodies. You know what everybody says, "Oh there's no mass shootings in

431
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:02,560
Europe." Yeah there is. Actually there's tons of mass shootings, but the

432
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:06,680
bullets get stopped by how thick the hair on women's bodies are, like as if

433
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:09,400
they have a Bible sitting in their front pocket. Yeah exactly.

434
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:13,960
Nobody can, everyone's wearing basically a bulletproof hair dust. It's literally Kevlar. Yeah. I heard they

435
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:17,680
harvest that to make Kevlar. Yeah it's basically like a spider web or a silkworm.

436
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:22,640
A French woman's hair basically has 1,000 little strains in it.

437
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:23,640
Yeah.

438
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:32,400
So like one normal American hair is equal to or like one French like one strand is one

439
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:34,080
normal American's hair.

440
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:35,680
Also they don't even walk.

441
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:37,080
They use their fleas like nails.

442
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:39,280
And they're all like drinking wine.

443
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:44,760
These hairy French women you'll be thinking you're having sex with one and you're freaking

444
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:48,520
coming out of your thing and and and the woman goes with you but you didn't even

445
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:53,080
put it in it's like oh my gosh I guess your lice were sucking my wiener the

446
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:57,360
whole time. I was completely stuck in your hair and your lice were a pleasure.

447
00:20:57,360 --> 00:21:03,160
They have the Louvre. Yeah I Louvre to not go to Europe. Uh-huh yeah that's a really good

448
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:07,800
point. Yeah. Hey UK I will not be visiting you.

449
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:14,080
Okay. Yeah that's what I say when I see a French woman's hairy ass. Yeah yeah.

450
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:18,880
Yeah, they have Berlin Berlin. I'm going over there. I'm seeing the women. I'm

00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:29,200
lot of the ones in Germany a birdhine yep I'd rather I've never had to go there

453
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:33,320
I'd never had a worse time than going to fucking Germany and seeing a disgusting

454
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:37,640
see all these women look like sheep they look like complete and not to mention

455
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:42,920

00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:47,800

00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:52,360
like how the fuck am I supposed to cut these women look exactly like fucking sheep to me.

458
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:55,560
Yep. It's fucking bullshit. It's pretty gross. And now they're trying to get rid of Boris,

459
00:21:55,560 --> 00:22:00,760
one of the last fucking cool ass guys in all of Europe. Coolest haircut in the world. Just

461
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:09,480

462
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:15,960
is Asia. He's he's he was raised in China. Boris Johnson is from China. Yeah.

463
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:20,920
That's crazy. Yeah. Do you know the do you remember Far East movement like a G6?

464
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:26,840
Yeah. Oh, I'm getting moved from the first. Yeah. Yeah. Get that verse. I

Shaving all their heads. Is that what it was?

Shaving all their heads.

00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:45,880
Make them smoother than eggs.

Don't come up to me when I'm ordering Gregg's.

487
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:36,160
news about Ukraine. What? Apparently a lot of the Ukrainian citizens and soldiers

488
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:42,680
are harming Russians. Wow. That's disgusting. No. Apparently weapons are

that few may have died. I heard some horrible news about Ukraine. Yeah the

destroys Ukraine destroys all of Europe and just makes like a cool new bridge

496
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:20,780
between the Russia and the US and maybe we could have we can you what about a

497
00:24:20,780 --> 00:24:24,680
big water slide? I mean looking at this sit this situation between Russia and

498
00:24:24,700 --> 00:24:30,060
I think now more than ever is when I finally need to perfect Freddy Krueger's abilities

499
00:24:30,060 --> 00:24:34,300
because I would love to haunt the dreams of every man, woman, and child who thinks it's

500
00:24:34,300 --> 00:24:36,500

563
00:27:57,380 --> 00:28:01,180
yeah pokemon snap is the gayest shit ever i mean no it's really i never played the original

564
00:28:01,180 --> 00:28:04,380
out of all the pokemon games, it's the least cool pokemon game.

565
00:28:04,380 --> 00:28:06,380
And that's really saying something.

566
00:28:06,380 --> 00:28:07,380
Woah!

567
00:28:07,380 --> 00:28:09,380
Oh my god, they did that again.

568
00:28:09,380 --> 00:28:10,380
Woah!

569
00:28:10,380 --> 00:28:11,380
He's been through enough.

570
00:28:11,380 --> 00:28:13,260
You're really piling on.

571
00:28:13,260 --> 00:28:17,180
I know, that was a little too much, but to be fair, it was about Pokemon Snap.

572
00:28:17,180 --> 00:28:20,500
He sucks.

573
00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:22,220
You really love Pokemon Snap.

574
00:28:22,220 --> 00:28:23,220
It's so good.

575
00:28:23,220 --> 00:28:24,220
People talk about Pokemon Snap all the time.

576
00:28:24,220 --> 00:28:25,220
I really never.

577
00:28:25,220 --> 00:28:30,260
Pokemon Snap was one of those games where I think one time I went to a... was that GameCube

578
00:28:30,260 --> 00:28:34,340
Nintendo 64. I think it was 64. Whichever one it was, I went to a hotel that had like

579
00:28:34,340 --> 00:28:38,700
one of those like, it had like a Nintendo 64 that you could like pay to use and I

580
00:28:38,700 --> 00:28:41,780
like begged my parents to use it for the one night and I played Pokemon Snap and

581
00:28:41,780 --> 00:28:44,980
I was like this is the worst thing I've ever played in my life. You just weren't good at it.

582
00:28:44,980 --> 00:28:49,780
It's not fun, you don't get to fight. It's not a fighting game. Am I crazy or did they do like a

583
00:28:49,780 --> 00:28:56,140
Playboy Snap? Like a... They, no you're thinking of Leisure Suit Larry. I don't think so.

584
00:28:56,140 --> 00:29:02,380
Oh, no, no, you're thinking of that you're thinking of that mission we went on. Oh, I'm thinking of the mission that we did in real life

585
00:29:02,380 --> 00:29:04,380
It's a Playboy mansion. Yeah

586
00:29:04,380 --> 00:29:10,700
Like bushes the Playboy rebrand it the last like four years has been so fun. I haven't

587
00:29:10,700 --> 00:29:16,900
Yeah, basically they like do like

588
00:29:16,900 --> 00:29:23,700
It's just become like a girl power magazine. Really? Yeah, but like my but like my grandpa probably still has a Playboy

589
00:29:23,740 --> 00:29:30,080
Yeah, he's getting these articles. It's literally only the articles now. No, no, they they know

590
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:34,180
Brandon wants is to change the playboy into only the article he wants

591
00:29:34,180 --> 00:29:39,060
Yeah, he wants to make it New York Times playboy. They're all losing all the boobs

592
00:29:39,060 --> 00:29:43,740
Hustlers gonna be these days. It's gonna be just fucking it's so it's really funny

593
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:49,340
How long they how they're still still doing articles. Well, fuck. What's his name? The the Hugh Heff

594
00:29:49,340 --> 00:29:52,480
- It was like a ultimate next level rapist.

595
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:53,320
- Oh yeah.

596
00:29:53,320 --> 00:29:54,280
- It was so Bill Cosby used to hang out

597
00:29:54,280 --> 00:29:55,740
at the Playboy Mansion all the time.

598
00:29:55,740 --> 00:29:58,240
- He would, Bill Cosby would hang out there

599
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:00,080
and pretend to be a toilet.

600
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:02,680
- And now they get Kate Upton to have her

601
00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:05,680
dress like an angel, and she's like,

602
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:06,520
"This is for Roe V. Wade."

603
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:09,280
- I would say anybody who wears a bathrobe

604
00:30:09,280 --> 00:30:12,280
is probably has some issues with sexual consent.

605
00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:16,160
- You need access to your naked body way too easily

606
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:20,880
as a way there's way less rapey comfortable clothes. You can be wearing

607
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:24,960
at your mansion. Yeah, that's a that's a huge red for example little

608
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:29,920
a curious George pajamas, which yeah even but see with the pajamas. You have to be

609
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:33,120
careful monkey because a lot of these pajamas to you'll see you'll see they'll

610
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:37,200
have the the buttons on the back to open the butt flap. Yeah, and that's also not

611
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:41,760
so good, but also you can't do much with your like just your butt. Yeah, you know

612
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:46,960
like you can do with your butt but like you can't seen so much you can't attack

613
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:51,000
a woman with your ass you'd be in the same way that Hugh Hefner and Bill Cosby

614
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:55,720
did with the front Hugh Hugh Hefner attacked a ton of women with his butt

615
00:30:55,720 --> 00:31:03,760
those old man dinosaur farts he'd be sitting in there he'd be like well I'm

616
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:09,200
gonna eat chili again for dinner that's what he said the end of his life that's

617
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:13,340
what Hugh Hefner sounded like. All the pipes he would smoke that gave him malignant

618
00:31:13,340 --> 00:31:18,200
tumors in his throat. He lived so long. He lived so long because of the tumors

619
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:22,160
actually had a symbiotic relationship with him. Yeah. And he'd sit there in his

620
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:29,120
robes and he'd say like, "Hot dogs again, oh boy!" Yeah. That was the tumors talking and they

621
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:33,100
wanted to put more carcinogens in the into his body. So he could blow farts in

622
00:31:33,100 --> 00:31:37,440
girls faces. So he could blow farts but also the methane from the farts would go

623
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:41,680
into his body. He'd make them sign an NDA and as they... It's kind of like a circular...

624
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:47,320
like a... As they dot the I in their name, Cherry, with a heart, he would just...

625
00:31:47,320 --> 00:31:50,120
he would already... they'd look up, they'd say, "Here you go," and he'd already be

626
00:31:50,120 --> 00:31:55,380
blowing a fucking hot noxious fume. And they had dust on them. He'd like to put

627
00:31:55,380 --> 00:31:59,520
baby powder on his butthole. So that it had... you'd see it. Yeah. And also he dyed it

628
00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:03,280
green. It was completely green baby powder. You know how sometimes... You ever seen the videos of

629
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:07,360
him sitting in a hot tub yeah right well there's no way he was yeah he was

630
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:11,620
striking yeah you can't see his legs at all you guys know when sometimes you'll

631
00:32:11,620 --> 00:32:15,560
fart you have to like wipe your ass mm-hmm he had when he farted they'd have

632
00:32:15,560 --> 00:32:20,520
to wipe the walls yeah that's right yeah so the Playboy mansion was covered in

633
00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:24,840
mahogany yeah that's how they would it wasn't that's the thing it was it was

634
00:32:24,840 --> 00:32:29,480
very light would paint the entire mansion like the episode of Spongebob

635
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:34,360
job with where they paint Mr. Crabs house and he would basically paint the front of

636
00:32:34,360 --> 00:32:37,580
his asshole and make a humongous bubble and it would pop yeah yeah.

637
00:32:37,580 --> 00:32:43,780
That's how it happened. It's the truth. I really hope they have to a palpitating

638
00:32:43,780 --> 00:32:47,580
playboy man. What do you think the playboy mansion? What do they do with it

639
00:32:47,580 --> 00:32:52,280
now? What do you? I think they should actually turn that into housing. I

640
00:32:52,280 --> 00:32:56,980
literally think they should turn that shit into affordable housing. Yeah, us

641
00:32:57,240 --> 00:32:59,940
excuse away turning a mansion to affordable housing. A mansion is

642
00:32:59,940 --> 00:33:02,960
expensive. You think it was somebody a family's going to live in there for

643
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:06,980
what a hundred dollars a month yeah, realistically guys that's not possible.

644
00:33:06,980 --> 00:33:09,240
They should make it twenty percent affordable housing, because I think

645
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:14,060
that's the requirement and what does one like a few rooms yeah, a few rooms

646
00:33:14,060 --> 00:33:19,160
of just like poor migrant workers, and everybody else is like people like

647
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:21,720
rich guys, who are like I'm going to fuck people in the yeah, rape

648
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:25,600
acolytes yeah, exactly looked up to this like Rick Moran. I was thinking of

649
00:33:25,620 --> 00:33:30,000
famous guy I could think of. Rick Moranis, he actually got his jaw slid. I heard he got

650
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:35,700
his jaw slid too. For no reason. For absolutely no reason. And it's like, I don't know if it was for no reason.

651
00:33:35,700 --> 00:33:40,660
Rick Moranis got his jaw slid for no reason. I witnessed Rick Moranis get his jaw, what

652
00:33:40,660 --> 00:33:44,680
was the full thing? I witnessed, why did I just witness Rick Moranis get his jaw slid

653
00:33:44,680 --> 00:33:52,880
for no reason? Rick Moranis jaw slid. That's legendary dude. That is so legendary to me.

654
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:59,700
legendary comedic actor too. He's in the five neat guys. Oh yeah. The SCTV sketch.

655
00:33:59,700 --> 00:34:04,040
Yeah yeah with Eugene Levy. I don't know why that one gets me every time. It's

656
00:34:04,040 --> 00:34:09,120
funny. It's a funny thing. Yeah. Eugene Levy, what a whiff of a kid. Yeah. Really

657
00:34:09,120 --> 00:34:13,880
messed up. Yeah. Oh yeah. He could have been such a funny kid. There's nothing more

658
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:18,960
embarrassing to me than... Yeah, Stifler's dad. He had a funny kid and he had a great kid in a movie. I mean his dad...

659
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:20,960
he's had a lot of great kids in the movies.

660
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:22,960
Stifler, now that's a good kid.

661
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:24,960
And you know every day Eugene Levy sits there and says

662
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:26,960
I wish I could have had Stifler.

663
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:28,960
I wish I could have had Stifler.

664
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:30,960
It really should have been Stiff's Creek.

665
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:32,960
And it's not, it's Shit's Creek.

666
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:34,960
Well you know the show

667
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:36,960
is called Shit's Creek.

668
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:38,960
I think that's

669
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:40,960
the number one

670
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:42,960
reason, you should,

671
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:44,960
when a person has a kid,

672
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:46,960
when a nepotism kid, they should never

673
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:50,160
be allowed to be anywhere near their parent in anything.

674
00:34:50,160 --> 00:34:51,760
- Yeah. - Agree.

675
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:53,560
- Unless it's like-- - 'Cause that just makes it,

676
00:34:53,560 --> 00:34:54,800
it's so embarrassing. - Unless it's like

677
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:56,360
Donald Trump and Donald Trump Jr.,

678
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:58,640
'cause The Apprentice was very funny to see him on there.

679
00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:00,120
- And Sofia Coppola. - Yeah.

680
00:35:00,120 --> 00:35:00,960
- Yeah.

681
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:02,760
- And-- - I guess I just mean that

682
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:04,560
they should, he should take his son out of his show.

683
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:06,160
- Harrison Ford and his son.

684
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:08,080
- 'Cause besides his son, that's a great show.

685
00:35:08,080 --> 00:35:09,160
- Yeah. - Yeah.

686
00:35:09,160 --> 00:35:10,400
If it weren't for, yeah. - Actually, I've never seen

687
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:11,520
Schitt's Creek, it's very popular.

688
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:12,480
It might be good. - I've seen a lot of it.

689
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:13,840
- It could be good. - It's not good.

690
00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:18,980
you know it's really bad. Yeah, it's really not good. I've seen I've seen

691
00:35:18,980 --> 00:35:24,100
all of it. You've seen all of it. I've seen every holy shit. Really? Yes, why

692
00:35:24,100 --> 00:35:29,740
it's my family. Watch my family. Watch it in quarantine. Okay, that's beast.

693
00:35:29,740 --> 00:35:33,580
Yeah, it's really bad. Who's the best character is Eugene? At least is he

694
00:35:33,580 --> 00:35:37,360
putting up numbers on his? He's funny. I feel like I mean, he's like Chris

695
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:40,140
Elliot's probably the best. He's only funny. What's the what's the woman's

696
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:44,680
Catherine O'Hara. Yeah she's funny in that. She's great in everything.

697
00:35:44,680 --> 00:35:49,760
Yeah exactly. They have an all-star cast and I have never watched,

698
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:53,680
except for that one boy, but I've never watched a single episode. There's a bunch of other

699
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:57,120
stinkers too. I think that they're probably,

700
00:35:57,120 --> 00:36:00,720
Eugene and Catherine are kind of holding it down.

701
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:04,800
Chris Elliott's not good in that show. He's good, I don't know.

702
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:08,240
The show is just really annoying so it's hard to think anyone is good in it.

703
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:12,960
Fox, NBC, CBS, ABC not come to us yet.

704
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:14,120
- I know, yeah.

705
00:36:14,120 --> 00:36:16,560
- I have a great idea for a show.

706
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:18,080
- Like can we just skip the-- - I have a lot of great ideas.

707
00:36:18,080 --> 00:36:18,920
- Shit's Toilet.

708
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:22,080
- Can we just skip the whole like streaming bullshit

709
00:36:22,080 --> 00:36:24,040
and we could do Shit's Toilet as a sequel?

710
00:36:24,040 --> 00:36:27,000
- Shit's Toilet, and it's a toilet store.

711
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:27,840
- It's like what's the--

712
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:29,320
- And then in every episode somebody says,

713
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:30,680
"Hey, who farted?"

714
00:36:30,680 --> 00:36:31,520
- What's the--

715
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:33,800
- What are a fart--

716
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:37,320
- What's the blackish sequel with the kids?

717
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:42,520
Shits Creek. No, they have a bunch of ish. Yeah, that's like white ish weirdish or

718
00:36:42,520 --> 00:36:47,820
something. No, it's like we're weird teenagers or something. Teenish. I don't

719
00:36:47,820 --> 00:36:51,620
remember. Blacker ish. It's not black. No, no.

720
00:36:51,620 --> 00:36:58,920
Yeah, the sequel series, the sequel series to black is just blacker ish. It's

721
00:36:58,920 --> 00:37:03,620
a candy store that they own. I don't think so. I don't think that's true.

722
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:07,320
that okay, well, there's a completely true. I heard that there's a spin off

723
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:11,720
the show is multiple spin off. Yeah, and one of them is black. One of them is

724
00:37:11,720 --> 00:37:16,820
mixed ish. Okay, one of them is grown ish and then it says another potential

725
00:37:16,820 --> 00:37:20,520
spin off named oldish. I'm thinking of never made it to air. I'm thinking of

726
00:37:20,520 --> 00:37:24,520
grown ish, which is all I was thinking of blacker ish, which is the show. I'm

727
00:37:24,520 --> 00:37:29,120
pitching. It's not you can't pitch black. It's a black owned candy store.

728
00:37:29,120 --> 00:37:33,120
You would not be involved in that show. Nobody would want you all. I would be

729
00:37:33,120 --> 00:37:37,560
white guy on the show the one white guy you'd be the clown the white guy that

730
00:37:37,560 --> 00:37:43,760
they make fun of you really want to so racial divide yeah your show like that

731
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:50,880
by having a funny of a goofy ass white character uh-huh really bro well

732
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:57,640
nothing are gone on no every day I don't think that's okay why because it's gonna

733
00:37:57,640 --> 00:38:01,360
be you and you're my friend and I don't want to see you just get eviscerated

734
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:07,880
it'll be like a like it'll be in good fun I don't think it would be but we need to

735
00:38:07,880 --> 00:38:14,120
do a Schitt's Creek like like sequel shit called shit shitting shitting so it's a

736
00:38:14,120 --> 00:38:20,400
it's a shitty it's a black crashing and Schitt's Creek yeah yeah shitting yeah

737
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:24,460
black on the candy store no we're not it's not called blacker ish the show is

738
00:38:24,460 --> 00:38:29,240
called blacker ish though shitting no it's not the shitting would be like

739
00:38:29,240 --> 00:38:32,440
would be Eugene Levy's other son.

740
00:38:32,440 --> 00:38:36,440
He's like he's a long lost son and comes back.

741
00:38:36,440 --> 00:38:40,440
And he kills the other son.

742
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:44,440
But not in a hate crime way.

743
00:38:44,440 --> 00:38:48,440
Like Cain and Abel.

744
00:38:48,440 --> 00:38:52,440
He's gay? Eugene Levy's son? I don't think so.

745
00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:56,440
I thought he was pretending to be gay in the show.

746
00:38:56,440 --> 00:38:58,440
But if you want one, hit me up.

747
00:38:58,440 --> 00:39:00,440

771
00:40:28,280 --> 00:40:31,560
somebody got in contact and asked and she in very broken English was like I

00:40:31,560 --> 00:40:35,100
broke up with him because he is a complete lesbian and he loves sucking

773
00:40:35,100 --> 00:40:41,280
cock. So I guess he was that's her way of saying that. Wow. I looked up Boomish and I

00:43:47,320 --> 00:43:53,140
as kind of - - I'm - - as hell you're not - - it's yours we've had this

813
00:43:53,140 --> 00:43:58,740
argument before have we so - are you kind of - yeah I still I think he's

814
00:43:58,740 --> 00:44:02,900
I don't think you turning your hat weird is making you any more hyphy though.

815
00:44:02,900 --> 00:44:03,900
Honestly.

816
00:44:03,900 --> 00:44:04,900
It's LP.

817
00:44:04,900 --> 00:44:06,580
I think that might be, you look exactly like LP right now.

818
00:44:06,580 --> 00:44:07,580
You do.

819
00:44:07,580 --> 00:44:08,580
Yeah.

820
00:44:08,580 --> 00:44:09,580
You do look exactly like LP.

821
00:44:09,580 --> 00:44:10,580
You look literally exactly like LP.

822
00:44:10,580 --> 00:44:14,940
Yeah, you look like a complete LP, kind of knowledgeable rapper.

823
00:44:14,940 --> 00:44:18,620
I'm splashing in gas and flashing my trash.

824
00:44:18,620 --> 00:44:19,620
Bernie Sanders!

825
00:44:19,620 --> 00:44:20,620
It's not.

826
00:44:20,620 --> 00:44:21,620
Is that what he sounds like?

827
00:44:21,620 --> 00:44:22,780
No, not at all.

828
00:44:22,780 --> 00:44:25,340
Bernie Sanders and I are smoking crack!

829
00:44:25,340 --> 00:44:26,340
He doesn't smoke crack.

830
00:44:26,340 --> 00:44:27,860
I'm smoking crack rap!

831
00:44:27,860 --> 00:44:32,180
I'm a fucking unicorn and I'm a dragon watching crazy porn.

832
00:44:32,180 --> 00:44:33,500
I'm a fucking unicorn.

833
00:44:33,500 --> 00:44:36,380
Hitler 2 will soon be born.

834
00:44:36,380 --> 00:44:37,380
That kind of is right.

835
00:44:37,380 --> 00:44:38,380
That is, yeah, that's exactly the thing.

836
00:44:38,380 --> 00:44:41,620
And then I go down to the store and I bore with the floorboard door, buzz up with the

837
00:44:41,620 --> 00:44:42,620
door, butter bore.

838
00:44:42,620 --> 00:44:43,620
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

839
00:44:43,620 --> 00:44:48,220
I'm a robot flying through space.

840
00:44:48,220 --> 00:44:50,140
I'm a crazy bird with a laying egg.

841
00:44:50,140 --> 00:44:53,300
That's pretty much exactly what he said.

842
00:44:53,300 --> 00:44:55,380
I'm sitting on the biggest tallest chair.

843
00:44:55,380 --> 00:44:58,020
Yep, sitting on the biggest chair in the entire world.

844
00:44:58,020 --> 00:45:00,100
Yep, the-

845
00:45:00,100 --> 00:45:01,380
With a super girl.

846
00:45:01,380 --> 00:45:01,700
Yeah.

847
00:45:01,700 --> 00:45:02,660
Yep.

848
00:45:02,660 --> 00:45:04,020
And I'm gonna hurl.

849
00:45:04,020 --> 00:45:04,660
Yeah.

850
00:45:04,660 --> 00:45:06,260
And I'm a unicorn.

851
00:45:06,260 --> 00:45:07,700
And I'm a unicorn.

852
00:45:07,700 --> 00:45:09,220
Hitler 2 will soon be born.

853
00:45:09,220 --> 00:45:10,020
That's a fire line.

854
00:45:10,020 --> 00:45:12,500
That is a really fire line.

855
00:45:12,500 --> 00:45:13,780
Hitler 2 will soon be born.

856
00:45:13,780 --> 00:45:15,300
That's like also-

857
00:45:15,300 --> 00:45:16,740
I'm a motherfucking unicorn.

858
00:45:16,740 --> 00:45:18,020
I'm a motherfucking unicorn.

859
00:45:18,020 --> 00:45:19,700
Hitler 2 will soon be born.

860
00:45:19,700 --> 00:45:25,140
I think that should be, that should be the new Run the Jewels song they put in every

861
00:45:25,140 --> 00:45:30,820
movie trailer. The CIA just moved my corn. He's hungry for corn. He made corn for dinner.

862
00:45:30,820 --> 00:45:37,100
The CIA just moved my corn. And I'm having sex with a girl like porn. Wow. That's fire.

863
00:45:37,100 --> 00:45:48,220
Yeah. I'm going to join the pack. I'm going to maybe do a song with Andre Nicotina. I'm

864
00:45:48,220 --> 00:45:53,180
going to do... what else is in San Francisco? I'm going to go down a big hill. I'm going

865
00:45:53,180 --> 00:46:04,660
I saw a video of the Golden Gate Bridge when I was a kid and they zoom in and Michelle

866
00:46:04,660 --> 00:46:09,940
Tanner's face is there and the guy says "Lost out there and you're all alone!"

867
00:46:09,940 --> 00:46:12,260
I don't know what kind of old man bullshit you're on.

868
00:46:12,260 --> 00:46:13,540
I don't know what this is.

869
00:46:13,540 --> 00:46:15,740
I guess nobody even cares where I'm going for vacation.

870
00:46:15,740 --> 00:46:16,740
Where are you going for vacation?

871
00:46:16,740 --> 00:46:19,100
I don't know, I guess nobody cares.

872
00:46:19,100 --> 00:46:20,100
You've talked about your vacation a lot.

873
00:46:20,100 --> 00:46:21,100
Where are you going?

874
00:46:21,100 --> 00:46:22,460
Not worth bringing up.

875
00:46:22,460 --> 00:46:25,360
I want to know now he's going to the beach. I actually don't know where you're

876
00:46:25,360 --> 00:46:30,220
going. Yeah, I know you have literally only said I'm going to the beach. He

877
00:46:30,220 --> 00:46:34,500
didn't tell us like where he's going on a mission. I think somebody gave you a

878
00:46:34,500 --> 00:46:39,780
mission. I tell you where I'm from above. I think a Christlike figure gave Cameron

879
00:46:39,780 --> 00:46:44,780
a mission the Congo really the Congo you for trying to find a big gorilla or

880
00:46:44,780 --> 00:46:48,100
snake or something is that what that movies about which ones that's about

881
00:46:48,100 --> 00:46:51,940
yeah Congress about gorillas it's about a bunch of them. I think well I only read

882
00:46:51,940 --> 00:46:54,940
the book I don't know what the movie and then the book is about a bunch of

883
00:46:54,940 --> 00:47:00,380
intelligent is not in a conga that's in South America yeah and John Voight plays

884
00:47:00,380 --> 00:47:04,740
like a Cuban that movie is they're casting a movie is crazy yeah it's so

885
00:47:04,740 --> 00:47:09,780
cubes in ice cubes in it fucking isn't that a remake though no no I thought

886
00:47:09,780 --> 00:47:14,860
there was an old anaconda probably there's a movie about an old anaconda

887
00:47:14,860 --> 00:47:18,140
I'm thinking of the song anaconda yeah but who else there's a bunch of people

888
00:47:18,140 --> 00:47:22,740
in that. There's a kid in my art class in high school who said like, "Whatever you

889
00:47:22,740 --> 00:47:29,820
do, do not look up the Nicki Minaj Anaconda video." Really? I watched it when it

890
00:47:29,820 --> 00:47:33,740
first came out. Well I didn't know there were four Anaconda movies. I thought

891
00:47:33,740 --> 00:47:38,480
there were only two. Rap videos used to be so much closer to porn though.

892
00:47:38,480 --> 00:47:43,260
There used to be so many rap videos that were actually like naked women, like

893
00:47:43,260 --> 00:47:46,820
completely naked. Wasn't there like... Tip drill. Yeah, wasn't there a few

894
00:47:46,820 --> 00:47:50,900
like videos that were like look at the go online to see the answer version yeah

895
00:47:50,900 --> 00:47:55,300
yeah they do they do the sucker free like after dark thing on MTV - well they would

896
00:47:55,300 --> 00:47:59,500
never show them on that yeah and then they'd be like if you want the uncensored

897
00:47:59,500 --> 00:48:04,740
version go to Nelly's website yeah yeah and you go on there and he's swiping the

898
00:48:04,740 --> 00:48:08,540
swipe it for your butthole legendary moment completely legendary though

899
00:48:08,540 --> 00:48:12,820
insanely do you know about that I wasn't listening listen he swiped a credit card

900
00:48:12,820 --> 00:48:17,060
through a woman's butthole. Who did? Nelly. That's cool. Yeah. So cool.

901
00:48:17,060 --> 00:48:22,420
The Saint Lunatics. I need a tip. Saint Lunatics, unlockable characters in NBA Street Volume 2.

902
00:48:22,420 --> 00:48:27,620
Yeah. They need to bring back the Def Jam fighting game. Yeah. They need to bring back just unlockable

903
00:48:27,620 --> 00:48:32,420
characters like that in games. I think that, I think they should take the technology that

904
00:48:32,420 --> 00:48:37,220
everyone's using to make AI pictures of like, Garfield goes to hell or whatever,

905
00:48:37,220 --> 00:48:41,780
and they need to put it to work so that you can auto-generate and you can type in a thing and

906
00:48:41,780 --> 00:48:43,920
and it will make a fighting game with all the characters

907
00:48:43,920 --> 00:48:45,060
from that thing. - That's such a good idea.

908
00:48:45,060 --> 00:48:46,660
- Yeah. - That's kind of like Mugen.

909
00:48:46,660 --> 00:48:48,380
- Yeah, but it's AI.

910
00:48:48,380 --> 00:48:50,860
'Cause Mugen is made by like 12 year old kids.

911
00:48:50,860 --> 00:48:52,260
And that's basically slave labor

912
00:48:52,260 --> 00:48:53,420
and how to support shit like that.

913
00:48:53,420 --> 00:48:55,460
I think we should enslave robots and computers instead.

914
00:48:55,460 --> 00:48:57,260
- Mugen's not made by slave labor.

915
00:48:57,260 --> 00:48:58,100
- Yeah, it is.

916
00:48:58,100 --> 00:48:59,140
- Same with Roblox.

917
00:48:59,140 --> 00:49:00,300
- Yeah.

918
00:49:00,300 --> 00:49:01,140
- Really?

919
00:49:01,140 --> 00:49:03,220
- Complete slaves on the back end.

920
00:49:03,220 --> 00:49:04,060
- That's pretty cool.

921
00:49:04,060 --> 00:49:06,340
- The slaves have to move the characters on the screen.

922
00:49:06,340 --> 00:49:07,180
- Yeah, they--

923
00:49:07,180 --> 00:49:08,000
- Mugen was annoying though,

924
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:09,340
'cause if you wanted to add a character,

925
00:49:09,340 --> 00:49:12,880
you had to go in and like type in the fucking code and everything. Yeah, it's

926
00:49:12,880 --> 00:49:16,180
very annoying. That's why I'm saying we need to have an AI version. Yeah.

927
00:49:16,180 --> 00:49:22,100
That goes on PlayStation. That's why you always download a preloaded version of Mujin. Yeah, but it should also... but that's the thing about Mujin.

928
00:49:22,100 --> 00:49:26,980
Like I don't want it to be like Spongebob versus Dr. Phil or

929
00:49:26,980 --> 00:49:31,900
whatever. I want it to be like, yeah, like I type in like, I type in Anaconda and

930
00:49:31,900 --> 00:49:35,460
it's every actor from Anaconda. Yeah. And there's no... and the Anaconda is

931
00:49:35,460 --> 00:49:39,860
there to also people. I know yeah, exactly anything yeah, I type in like my friend,

932
00:49:39,860 --> 00:49:43,940
my funny ass friend group yeah, and I get to control them and make them fight each

933
00:49:43,940 --> 00:49:47,380
other yeah, and I could do a little tournaments and make myself the winner.

934
00:49:47,380 --> 00:49:52,820
That'd be cool yeah, what if you typed in well here's okay, here's a horror movie

935
00:49:52,820 --> 00:49:56,420
pitch okay, okay, so that this is a horror movie in a world where that game

936
00:49:56,420 --> 00:49:59,940
exists rather watch a horror movie that game already exists. Okay, that game

937
00:49:59,940 --> 00:50:03,300
exists. I'm ready for the pitch you type in you type into the thing into the

938
00:50:03,300 --> 00:50:06,540
thing to make a new game people in my house right now and there you see the

939
00:50:06,540 --> 00:50:11,460
roster load up it's like you your mom your dad your brother your sister the

940
00:50:11,460 --> 00:50:15,140
killer attacker oh my god his name is the killer attacker well it could be

941
00:50:15,140 --> 00:50:18,700
anything no I think I see a killer versus when you know it says like the

942
00:50:18,700 --> 00:50:24,380
killer yeah yeah or like or maybe you started the enshrouded murder you play

943
00:50:24,380 --> 00:50:28,660
one in one game mom versus dad you a new challenger has appeared just stronger

944
00:50:28,660 --> 00:50:35,000
then yeah a new challenger and then you're yeah and then one by one you see

945
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:38,540
across the roster mom character locked dad yeah

946
00:50:38,540 --> 00:50:42,760
director a lot the only one that's unlocked aborted brother and then you

947
00:50:42,760 --> 00:50:46,960
know aborted brother and he kills both your dad secret family dad's secret oh

948
00:50:46,960 --> 00:50:56,020
my god yeah it'll tie family it's - yeah dad is in the middle yeah it's like it's

949
00:50:56,020 --> 00:51:00,420
like an M bison yeah yeah damn yeah that'd be so sick we should make a

950
00:51:00,420 --> 00:51:07,180
fighting game I'm trying to I've been learning about making textures yeah yeah

951
00:51:07,180 --> 00:51:12,100
I tried to get in I made a I'm in a college me really are it sucks so I have

952
00:51:12,100 --> 00:51:17,180
so many like half finished unit only thing so bad yeah it's all just so hard

953
00:51:17,180 --> 00:51:22,340
it's all dogshit it's all like it all programming is is like watching YouTube

954
00:51:22,340 --> 00:51:25,460
videos and about specific stuff that you need to do.

955
00:51:25,460 --> 00:51:26,300
- Yeah.

956
00:51:26,300 --> 00:51:27,900
- And then six months later,

957
00:51:27,900 --> 00:51:28,980
when you want to work on it again,

958
00:51:28,980 --> 00:51:30,180
you just completely forgot it.

959
00:51:30,180 --> 00:51:31,660
- Exactly. Nothing, I mean,

960
00:51:31,660 --> 00:51:33,260
you can learn like actual programming,

961
00:51:33,260 --> 00:51:36,300
but nothing, no interesting programming

962
00:51:36,300 --> 00:51:37,660
is something you ever have to do.

963
00:51:37,660 --> 00:51:38,500
- Definitely.

964
00:51:38,500 --> 00:51:39,320
- Yeah.

965
00:51:39,320 --> 00:51:40,160
- Yeah.

966
00:51:40,160 --> 00:51:43,100
- Like you're not like creating new things or anything.

967
00:51:43,100 --> 00:51:44,820
It's all you Google, like how to make a guy

968
00:51:44,820 --> 00:51:45,660
punch another guy.

969
00:51:45,660 --> 00:51:46,500
- Yeah, exactly.

970
00:51:46,500 --> 00:51:47,320
- Yeah.

971
00:51:47,320 --> 00:51:50,140
- Made a Red Sox fitted hat in a skater XL.

972
00:51:50,140 --> 00:51:50,980
- Hell yeah.

973
00:51:50,980 --> 00:51:51,820
- He saw me do that yesterday.

974
00:51:51,820 --> 00:51:53,700
- How did she get into like Blender?

975
00:51:53,700 --> 00:51:57,540
- I don't, I think I'm just gonna stay with textures now.

976
00:51:57,540 --> 00:51:59,660
- Okay, so you're making like little, okay.

977
00:51:59,660 --> 00:52:01,460
- I'm making new shirts.

978
00:52:01,460 --> 00:52:03,300
- I wanna see you model.

979
00:52:03,300 --> 00:52:04,860
I wanna see you model bikinis.

980
00:52:04,860 --> 00:52:07,980
- I don't, there's a bunch of tutorials on here

981
00:52:07,980 --> 00:52:10,620
that I have been looking at, but I don't know.

982
00:52:10,620 --> 00:52:13,140
- Tutorials on your computer?

983
00:52:13,140 --> 00:52:16,880
- My goal is to fully make an Osiris D3 mesh.

984
00:52:16,880 --> 00:52:19,740
- Yeah, you should probably learn Blender or something.

985
00:52:19,740 --> 00:52:21,300
- That's your biggest goal in life?

986
00:52:21,300 --> 00:52:24,680
not my biggest goal in life but with this. What's your biggest goal in your entire

987
00:52:24,680 --> 00:52:30,540
life? Become God. Probably settle down have a couple kids and then just die

988
00:52:30,540 --> 00:52:34,340
very peacefully. Okay now your girlfriend stopped listening now what's your real

989
00:52:34,340 --> 00:52:43,080
biggest goal? Real goal? Yeah. Settle down, get a mini bike. Yes. A little pocket

990
00:52:43,080 --> 00:52:49,140
rocket. Oh my god. Drive it around in a big loop-de-loop. It's fucking awesome.

991
00:52:49,140 --> 00:52:50,380
- Like go up, go down?

992
00:52:50,380 --> 00:52:54,500
- No, like Bob Burnquist mega ramp in his backyard.

993
00:52:54,500 --> 00:52:56,660
Like I take a little dirt bike down.

994
00:52:56,660 --> 00:53:01,660
Actually, I think maybe my life goal is do the mega ramp.

995
00:53:01,660 --> 00:53:03,180
- Do the mega ramp?

996
00:53:03,180 --> 00:53:05,460
- Yeah, do the Bob Burnquist mega ramp.

997
00:53:05,460 --> 00:53:06,380
- It's big, dude.

998
00:53:06,380 --> 00:53:07,500
- It's fucking crazy.

999
00:53:07,500 --> 00:53:10,500
Bob Burnquist is like the craziest--

1000
00:53:10,500 --> 00:53:11,660
- He just wakes up and does that?

1001
00:53:11,660 --> 00:53:12,500
- Yeah.

1002
00:53:12,500 --> 00:53:13,340
He's like the--

1003
00:53:13,340 --> 00:53:15,700
- He just drinks a cup of coffee, does a mega ramp?

1004
00:53:15,700 --> 00:53:18,860
- It's insane that he's able to do that.

1005
00:53:18,860 --> 00:53:23,200
him and like there's like probably like 10 or 12 guys.

1006
00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:24,700
Didn't a little kid do it?

1007
00:53:24,700 --> 00:53:26,700
Yeah, I think his name was...

1008
00:53:26,700 --> 00:53:28,400
I don't remember.

1009
00:53:28,400 --> 00:53:29,400
Maximum Airy.

1010
00:53:29,400 --> 00:53:32,620
Have you ever heard of Burberry Airy?

1011
00:53:32,620 --> 00:53:33,460
No.

1012
00:53:33,460 --> 00:53:37,260
He's this like really fucking shitty like Instagram skater.

1013
00:53:37,260 --> 00:53:41,620
He has like his big thing is that he'll skate and those like you know those Yeezy foam like

1014
00:53:41,620 --> 00:53:43,920
slippers or like the sandals.

1015
00:53:43,920 --> 00:53:47,260
The foam like through boosts or whatever the fuck they're called.

1016
00:53:47,260 --> 00:53:47,760
Yeah.

1017
00:53:47,760 --> 00:53:51,520
like skating those and big like Liberty Spikes and shit he looks like a fucking idiot.

1018
00:53:51,520 --> 00:53:54,640
He looks like a creative character or created character in like a Tony Hawk game.

1019
00:53:54,640 --> 00:53:56,280
I mean he seems like a creative character.

1020
00:53:56,280 --> 00:53:57,280
Yeah.

1021
00:53:57,280 --> 00:53:58,280
Based on his fashion choices.

1022
00:53:58,280 --> 00:54:03,840
There's this video of Burberryary where he's on Instagram live and somebody is like who

1023
00:54:03,840 --> 00:54:07,360
inspires you like blah blah blah or like you're such an inspiration to me.

1024
00:54:07,360 --> 00:54:10,800
He's like honestly do not look up to me.

1025
00:54:10,800 --> 00:54:13,880
Do not look up to me because I'm a bitch bro.

1026
00:54:13,880 --> 00:54:14,880

00:55:19,320 --> 00:55:24,400
Yeah, dude, I told you I really want to do that to my hair

1040
00:55:24,400 --> 00:55:31,840
Stand up though, I would like to make a hair on my head stand up. Yeah, like the guy from static

1041
00:55:31,840 --> 00:55:33,840
This is like a Wayne's dad

1042
00:55:33,840 --> 00:55:42,400
The video made by hype beasts. It's the title is Burberry. Ari wants you to hate him. Whoa. Wow, you guys know giant afro

1043
00:55:43,520 --> 00:55:50,540
Yeah, you could do it. I think you guys know what you're guys know Wayne static. Yeah, it did die touching a microphone and it electrocuted

1044
00:55:50,540 --> 00:55:53,640
He died from drugs

1045
00:55:53,640 --> 00:55:55,640
but

1046
00:55:55,640 --> 00:55:57,720
He died and he and the and the

1047
00:55:57,720 --> 00:56:02,840
Maybe I said this before but it's like the band the rest of the band did like a reunion tour

1048
00:56:02,840 --> 00:56:08,160
uh-huh and like they like played his vocals over the like through the over through like the PA or whatever and

1049
00:56:08,160 --> 00:56:12,560
In they had a an animatronic skeleton like as the vocalist

1050
00:56:13,160 --> 00:56:14,640
- That's so fucking sick.

1051
00:56:14,640 --> 00:56:15,480
- That's fucking awesome.

1052
00:56:15,480 --> 00:56:16,680
- It's like the coolest thing.

1053
00:56:16,680 --> 00:56:19,160
So I would say, yeah, if any of us die,

1054
00:56:19,160 --> 00:56:20,000
- Live show with our bones there.

1055
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:22,920
- Yeah, live show with an animatronic skeleton.

1056
00:56:22,920 --> 00:56:23,760
- Yeah.

1057
00:56:23,760 --> 00:56:24,920
- It's truly the coolest thing.

1058
00:56:24,920 --> 00:56:27,960
Our real bones, animatronic rebranded.

1059
00:56:27,960 --> 00:56:28,800
- I could easily,

1060
00:56:28,800 --> 00:56:30,840
one year I could be one of the best skaters in America.

1061
00:56:30,840 --> 00:56:32,360
- No, no, just dressing like that.

1062
00:56:32,360 --> 00:56:34,040
- Nope, I'm gonna be a better skater.

1063
00:56:34,040 --> 00:56:34,880
- All right.

1064
00:56:34,880 --> 00:56:36,720
- I had a dream that I was a skater last night.

1065
00:56:36,720 --> 00:56:37,560
- Yeah?

1066
00:56:37,560 --> 00:56:38,400
- Or I was skateboarding.

1067
00:56:38,400 --> 00:56:39,220
- It's fun, isn't it?

1068
00:56:39,220 --> 00:56:41,400
- I was skateboarding around a town that I invented

1069
00:56:41,400 --> 00:56:42,800
and it was actually insanely cool.

1070
00:56:42,800 --> 00:56:46,720
that's literally I have so many I did wake up and I was like oh I guess that's

1071
00:56:46,720 --> 00:56:50,360
kind of the fun part of skateboarding you can skate around yeah yeah I never

1072
00:56:50,360 --> 00:56:55,100
thought oh yeah I was just kind of skating around dude this skeleton so

1073
00:56:55,100 --> 00:56:58,600
sick can we just get three skeletons that we play our voices through we

1074
00:56:58,600 --> 00:57:03,280
should like that oh my god that's sick isn't that so I'm gonna do to my hair

1075
00:57:03,280 --> 00:57:09,020
it's yeah skeletons talking mm-hmm you know a new show about just three

1076
00:57:09,020 --> 00:57:13,980
skeletons I like skeletons me too I've never I don't think I've ever seen a

1077
00:57:13,980 --> 00:57:20,300
real human bone I have where that was like a museum I saw I saw a pile of bones

1078
00:57:20,300 --> 00:57:23,020
in the woods and they had ain't tell anybody we definitely talked about it

1079
00:57:23,020 --> 00:57:28,700
before they had that uh they had that um exhibit where at the museum where they

1080
00:57:28,700 --> 00:57:31,740
had a bunch of preserved human body oh yeah and they were like all like they're

1081
00:57:31,740 --> 00:57:36,300
like slaves and shit yeah yeah I saw that as a kid in it yeah I freaked me

1082
00:57:36,300 --> 00:57:41,420
I think I saw cat bones in the woods. I remember seeing it was in a bucket and

1083
00:57:41,420 --> 00:57:47,740
it was like a dead like wet bones. Wait do x-rays count? I don't think so. I saw so

1084
00:57:47,740 --> 00:57:52,980
many x-rays. I also saw that exhibit but it was I saw it back to back and one day I saw

1085
00:57:52,980 --> 00:57:56,580
that and the Dead Sea Scrolls back to back. Damn that's so cool. I saw an

1086
00:57:56,580 --> 00:58:01,740
exhibit or I was part of an exhibit. Really? There was a Penn and Teller had a

1087
00:58:01,740 --> 00:58:07,660
thing at the Museum of Science and you could put your head in it in this like

1088
00:58:07,660 --> 00:58:11,340
thing and it made your head look like it was floating. Do you remember the

1089
00:58:11,340 --> 00:58:15,980
electricity room at the Museum of Science? You met Penn and Teller? I saw I met a video of them.

1090
00:58:15,980 --> 00:58:21,020
Oh okay. I used to be so... It was like a thing where you just wait in line for a long time

1091
00:58:21,020 --> 00:58:24,460
and then your uncle takes a picture of you. I would do anything to meet Penn and Teller.

1092
00:58:24,460 --> 00:58:28,380
I wish I... I wonder if I still have that picture. I gotta ask my mom if my uncle

1093
00:58:28,380 --> 00:58:32,860
ever sent that to her. Do you think I could make Teller laugh? I think that you could make

1094
00:58:32,860 --> 00:58:38,220
Teller freaking talk. Do you think if he started, if I was on that show Fool Us with Penn and

1095
00:58:38,220 --> 00:58:44,020
Teller, I would walk into the audience and I would start tickling him so hard just to

1096
00:58:44,020 --> 00:58:49,020
see if he makes a sound. Yeah. Just fucking destroying him with my fingers. Yeah. Just,

1097
00:58:49,020 --> 00:58:53,180
yeah. I'd walk up to him with a false pretense. I'd walk up to him and I'd be like, "There's

1098
00:58:53,180 --> 00:58:57,380
nothing in my hands. There's nothing in my hands except your rib cage and the inside of

1099
00:58:57,380 --> 00:59:04,380
your legs I have to there's something horrible before you go alright so here's

1100
00:59:04,380 --> 00:59:09,280
the here's the trick yeah you go on stage also that is technically pen and teller

1101
00:59:09,280 --> 00:59:14,060
you go on stage you say hey before I start anything I just want to let you

1102
00:59:14,060 --> 00:59:21,460
know I have already fucked up my trick yeah you go on stage with a big metal

1103
00:59:21,460 --> 00:59:27,560
a cage and the door is open and you say, I think my tickle monster got loose.

1104
00:59:27,560 --> 00:59:31,680
That's right yeah, that's good and you say don't look down because he hates

1105
00:59:31,680 --> 00:59:35,220
when you look down everybody close their eyes is the only way to defeat the

1106
00:59:35,220 --> 00:59:39,040
tickle monster yeah and then teller he's going to be terrified to be shaking,

1107
00:59:39,040 --> 00:59:43,600
but he'll slowly kind of close his eyelids and then you pop up from behind

1108
00:59:43,600 --> 00:59:46,180
and that's how you get away with it too, because otherwise you're going to jail,

1109
00:59:46,180 --> 00:59:49,440
but they can't arrest a tickle monster and also as soon as he opens his eyes,

1110
00:59:49,460 --> 00:59:53,100
you start tickling yeah. What the hell did tickle much? I saw it right yeah,

1111
00:59:53,100 --> 00:59:56,620
just ran away. He just ran, he scurried that way, I saw his red tail. I have

1112
00:59:56,620 --> 01:00:00,100
a trick that I could pitch. What? Do you guys think that I could fool for

1113
01:00:00,100 --> 01:00:03,140
a pen and tell her with this? Yeah. Yeah, I would be like I'd have a deck

1114
01:00:03,140 --> 01:00:07,180
of cards. That's a classic magical mainstay. And every card is their card.

1115
01:00:07,180 --> 01:00:11,220
And I'd say, I'd say the first card on this deck will be an ace.

1116
01:00:11,220 --> 01:00:15,100
I draw it and it's an ace. Oh my God. And I think they could even shuffle

1117
01:00:15,100 --> 01:00:18,980
it beforehand. Whoa! That'd be sick. They could shuffle it as many times,

1118
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:22,200
they could go through and here you know what that how do you do it? Well, so

1119
01:00:22,200 --> 01:00:25,360
actually here's what it is. I'd have a deck of cards sealed deck of cards.

1120
01:00:25,360 --> 01:00:30,840
They they open it up. I have them open it up. I say go through the deck, take

1121
01:00:30,840 --> 01:00:34,720
out all the aces, take all the aces, burn them. You could burn you could eat

1122
01:00:34,720 --> 01:00:38,080
them, do whatever I don't care and then they hand it back to me and I say the

1123
01:00:38,080 --> 01:00:41,520
first card I draw will be an ace and I draw it. It's an ace. How do you do it?

1124
01:00:45,400 --> 01:00:50,040
maybe I'd like move behind my back really fast. Yeah. Oh yeah. I've got

1125
01:00:50,040 --> 01:00:58,760
the ultimate, this is the ultimate show here. Okay. So it's Fool Us Penn and

1126
01:00:58,760 --> 01:01:04,120
Teller but okay like in the same vein but it's called Make Us Laugh. Okay. And the

1127
01:01:04,120 --> 01:01:14,200
hosts Teller, Silent Bob and Harpo Marks. That'd be brutal. What an audience.

1128
01:01:14,200 --> 01:01:18,440
and Charlie Chaplin if you can get him yeah and then the audience behind them

1129
01:01:18,440 --> 01:01:22,520
is the writers and producers of SNL during an audition.

1130
01:01:22,520 --> 01:01:27,880
Oh yeah and they're not rough yeah oh my god that's right I know from experience

1131
01:01:27,880 --> 01:01:31,400
and also just because that's not that many people just a bunch of fucking

1132
01:01:31,400 --> 01:01:35,560
deaf people yeah just fucking thousands of deaf people yeah and

1133
01:01:35,560 --> 01:01:38,600
blind and deaf and blind and a couple of just a

1134
01:01:38,600 --> 01:01:42,280
couple of dead people and a few babies and it's hosted by Nick Cannon. No babies

1135
01:01:42,280 --> 01:01:45,400
These are way too easy, okay, not baby probably the easiest for us to make

1136
01:01:45,400 --> 01:01:45,740
us

1137
01:01:45,740 --> 01:01:51,740
yeah, like two or three horses and maybe a giraffe like a yeah, no, no, no,

1138
01:01:51,740 --> 01:01:55,520
that's way too easy, maybe a snail or bug yeah type

1139
01:01:55,520 --> 01:02:02,080
animal yeah, something with no vocal cords fish a fish yeah, good, that'd be

1140
01:02:02,080 --> 01:02:04,920
another one of the audience members, but then you got a clown fish because

1141
01:02:04,920 --> 01:02:08,680
people might work at it. But then you go out there and you tell me it's an easy

1142
01:02:08,680 --> 01:02:11,880
show, though you got there. You tell the aristocrats it's fucking over yep funny

1143
01:02:11,920 --> 01:02:17,680
of all time you hear the soon as you hear Harpo's horn honk yeah it's over

1144
01:02:17,680 --> 01:02:22,400
start doing Bill Hicks stuff - you know it's all just a ride it's actually just

1145
01:02:22,400 --> 01:02:27,640
bullshit out here shit is stupid if you do like real comedy like that work and

1146
01:02:27,640 --> 01:02:32,720
if you work in comedy kill yourself dude listen Bill Hicks was so funny you can

1147
01:02:32,720 --> 01:02:36,700
even make a fish laugh absolutely we were watching I think the other day we

1148
01:02:36,700 --> 01:02:39,340
You're watching old Sam Kinison bits?

1149
01:02:39,340 --> 01:02:40,180
- Yep.

1150
01:02:40,180 --> 01:02:41,000
- How the fuck?

1151
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:41,840
What?

1152
01:02:41,840 --> 01:02:45,500
I mean, I guess when you have nothing but TV,

1153
01:02:45,500 --> 01:02:48,180
that's probably one of the funniest things in the world.

1154
01:02:48,180 --> 01:02:50,100
- He used to do cool shit, man.

1155
01:02:50,100 --> 01:02:51,180
He'd yell. - Have you seen?

1156
01:02:51,180 --> 01:02:54,740
Dude, have you seen his, when he hosted SNL?

1157
01:02:54,740 --> 01:02:55,700
- Uh-uh.

1158
01:02:55,700 --> 01:02:57,140
- It's so sick.

1159
01:02:57,140 --> 01:02:57,980
- What's he do?

1160
01:02:57,980 --> 01:02:59,660
- He goes out on stage, they're playing,

1161
01:02:59,660 --> 01:03:01,860
and then they're not stopping playing,

1162
01:03:01,860 --> 01:03:04,140
and he kinda looks at them and gives them a shrug,

1163
01:03:04,140 --> 01:03:05,740
and then they point to a guitar

1164
01:03:05,740 --> 01:03:10,040
that they just have on stage and you start soloing wall and then he goes in

1165
01:03:10,040 --> 01:03:17,040
the like these bits like

1166
01:03:17,040 --> 01:03:18,820
you should

1167
01:03:18,820 --> 01:03:23,040
which shows you know you know when this will win this comes out

1168
01:03:23,040 --> 01:03:26,420
i think the show our brooklyn show will be next week

1169
01:03:26,420 --> 01:03:27,760
and so

1170
01:03:27,760 --> 01:03:29,020
by some tickets

1171
01:03:29,020 --> 01:03:33,780
swagger dot com slash shows it'll be a little bit like world army can buy

1172
01:03:33,780 --> 01:03:34,780
tickets to the website.

1173
01:03:34,780 --> 01:03:37,900
I can't tell you the name of the address of the venue, the day of, unless you already

1174
01:03:37,900 --> 01:03:38,900
know it.

1175
01:03:38,900 --> 01:03:39,900
What?

1176
01:03:39,900 --> 01:03:40,900
That doesn't matter.

1177
01:03:40,900 --> 01:03:41,900
I think that's how they do their tickets.

1178
01:03:41,900 --> 01:03:42,900
That's not important information.

1179
01:03:42,900 --> 01:03:43,900
That is pretty important.

1180
01:03:43,900 --> 01:03:45,780
Yeah, they will find that out when they buy a ticket.

1181
01:03:45,780 --> 01:03:46,780
It says it on their website.

1182
01:03:46,780 --> 01:03:48,580
If anyone complains about any of these fucking tickets, I'll kill you.

1183
01:03:48,580 --> 01:03:52,500
And we have Portland and Seattle on there too that will be in a few weeks I guess.

1184
01:03:52,500 --> 01:03:53,500
I think.

1185
01:03:53,500 --> 01:03:56,460
I'm not doing the day math.

1186
01:03:56,460 --> 01:03:59,540
And then we have shirts too.

1187
01:03:59,540 --> 01:04:01,780
