[LAUGHTER]

6
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:14,500
Ooh.

7
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:16,600
It's an especially haunted night here.

8
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:18,000
This is a--

9
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:18,640
What'd you get?

10
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:19,300
What'd you roll?

11
00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:20,400
I got 18.

12
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:20,900
18.

13
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:22,000
Holy shit.

14
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:22,500
Wow.

15
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:23,200
OK, you do the first.

16
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:24,080
That is the oldest.

17
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:25,400
That is the oldest you will go.

18
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:25,900
Yep.

19
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:26,400
What?

20
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:26,900
No.

21
00:00:26,900 --> 00:00:27,960
He said yep.

22
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:28,460
No.

23
00:00:28,460 --> 00:00:28,960
No.

24
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:29,520
He said yep.

25
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:31,520
I'm hitting stop. No, I'm hitting stop.

26
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:33,520
You have to subtract 7 also.

27
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:35,520
Oh, true.

28
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:37,520
11.

29
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:39,520
You are a sick piece of shit.

30
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:41,520
Here, I'll roll a D50 million for my age.

31
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:43,520
That's the highest I'll go.

32
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:45,520
Let's see what's the highest you'll go, Pat.

33
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:47,520
It's a 20. It's actually a 20.

34
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:49,520
It's not an 18 again. It's a 20.

35
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:51,520
It's great to know that you'll go for any age under 20.

36
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:53,520
No, no.

37
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:55,520
That's 11.

38
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:57,520
That's canon.

39
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:09,040
d4 for you look at that I hate this so we put dice in front of podcasts about list

40
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:13,720
just to see what would fucking happen yeah mm-hmm we play see low real quick

41
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:17,760
we're trapped inside because of a scary storm yeah there is a scary I keep

42
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:22,760
getting an alert a storm that's making a scary noise how do you play ceilo you

43
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:27,760
You get three die, you roll them, but you can't roll...

44
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:30,760
Five, five, four.

45
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:35,760
So you would... I mean it's basically like Yahtzee, but with three dice.

46
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:36,760
So I would win.

47
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:38,760
Is there a three dice version of Yahtzee?

48
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:39,760
How would I have not won?

49
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:43,760
It's like a gambling thing that super old black guys play on a wall on the street.

50
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:44,760
Okay, hold on.

51
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:46,760
And it's really good. You bet singles.

52
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:47,760
Yeah.

53
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:51,760
Four, five, six is basically the best thing.

54
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:58,120
thing okay three three five that's that's gonna bits terrible you would if I were

55
00:01:58,120 --> 00:02:02,160
you I'd reroll but you basically you reroll until you get something okay you

56
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:06,040
yeah do you lose money the whole time though you pretty much lose okay so it's

57
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:10,000
the best game ever you lose you lose one dollar every second six three five you

58
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,760
just keep rolling till you hit something and then you like a straight or like a

59
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:18,360
two of a kind or three of it was three of a kind one two one two three is the

60
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:20,640
worst it's basically automatic nothing.

61
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:21,640
No shit.

62
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:23,360
And you go around, everybody rolls a hand.

63
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:26,960
So like if I rolled a 1, 2, 3, he rolled a 3 of a kind.

64
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:27,960
Okay.

65
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:33,120
Like 3 3s, you rolled 3 4s, and Pat rolled 4, 5, 6, he would take everything.

66
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:34,720
What if I rolled like 10, 9, 100?

67
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:36,520
If you rolled 10, 9, 1, then you would probably win.

68
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:40,400
100, I got 3 2s and a 4.

69
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:43,520
Stop rolling things, none of these are hands.

70
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:45,560
Yeah, so what if I, okay if I roll these.

71
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:47,280
Those are 20s, that's different.

72
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:50,340
So I got a 9, a 9, and a 3.

73
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:51,340
What's that?

74
00:02:51,340 --> 00:02:56,920
Like if you rolled that with a normal die, you'd probably win.

75
00:02:56,920 --> 00:03:00,300
Okay so what about if I get a 14, 8, 13?

76
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:01,300
Is that...

77
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:02,880
Because that's 14 or 13 in a row.

78
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:05,760
Now you're playing Dungeons and Dragons.

79
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:06,760
So I would win.

80
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:11,100
You know what would be funny is to show up, see people playing CeeLo or whatever and show

81
00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:12,100
up with like three 20-sided...

82
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:14,100
*laughter*

83
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:16,100
*laughter*

84
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:18,100
*laughter*

85
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:20,100
*laughter*

86
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:22,100
*laughter*

87
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:24,100
*laughter*

88
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:26,100
*laughter*

89
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:28,100
*laughter*

90
00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:30,100
*laughter*

91
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:32,100
*laughter*

92
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:34,100
*laughter*

93
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:36,100
*laughter*

94
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:38,100
*laughter*

95
00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:40,100
*laughter*

96
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:43,620
I believe these gold pieces are mine.

97
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:46,100
Man, I gotta get into...

98
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:49,740
Man, gambling has straight up ruined my brain, I think.

99
00:03:49,740 --> 00:03:53,380
How? How? You have talked about

100
00:03:53,380 --> 00:03:56,940
gambling has zero effect on you at all. I think you might be the most... you have the

101
00:03:56,940 --> 00:04:01,180
most fragile brain of anybody I've ever known.

102
00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:04,700
Oh, you've known me for what, like three years now? You don't fucking know that already?

103
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:06,620
Well, I did know that... yeah, I knew that.

104
00:04:06,620 --> 00:04:08,620
Yeah, you fucking knew that.

105
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:12,020
yeah i'm not okay so just tell me how is it in minor inconvenience how is

106
00:04:12,020 --> 00:04:13,260
gambling my whole life

107
00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:16,740
broken your brain now I can't stop thinking

108
00:04:16,740 --> 00:04:21,420
about diamonds and I can't stop thinking about

109
00:04:21,420 --> 00:04:25,060
money that's like this the American way that's normal and I can't tell you about

110
00:04:25,060 --> 00:04:26,740
you don't think about that normally

111
00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:29,700
yeah go you don't you don't just sit around all day thing but diamonds money

112
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:31,420
and gold bars when you follow

113
00:04:31,420 --> 00:04:36,020
oh my god I've been having dreams I did I did have a second slot stream

114
00:04:36,020 --> 00:04:42,820
bars and sevens. What? What was it? Another dream about playing slots. What happened in

115
00:04:42,820 --> 00:04:48,540
this one? I played slots. The same thing as the first one. Did you win? I don't know.

116
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:55,500
I just played. No, so this is what I'm saying is I think that the slot streams really reveal

117
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:59,700
what kind of psychological effect gambling is having on me because in my dream I can't

118
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:03,380
tell if I'm winning or losing money but I'm really happy because there's lots of noises

119
00:05:03,380 --> 00:05:06,100
and flashing lights that are making me like smile.

120
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:06,940
- That's a true thought.

121
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:07,780
- And that's what's the fun part.

122
00:05:07,780 --> 00:05:10,420
- It's a really, it's like a return to childhood, right?

123
00:05:10,420 --> 00:05:11,260
- Yeah.

124
00:05:11,260 --> 00:05:13,060
- It's like seeing your mother's legs

125
00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:14,860
while you're crawling underneath the table.

126
00:05:14,860 --> 00:05:17,900
It's looking at, hold on.

127
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:18,740
- What do you mean by that?

128
00:05:18,740 --> 00:05:20,780
- What did you just say, Patches?

129
00:05:20,780 --> 00:05:22,940
Yo, mother's legs, nah.

130
00:05:22,940 --> 00:05:24,460
You guys know that trope, right?

131
00:05:24,460 --> 00:05:25,660
It's a trope.

132
00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:26,780
- Oh, man.

133
00:05:26,780 --> 00:05:29,180
- A trope from fucking Muppet Babies, maybe.

134
00:05:29,180 --> 00:05:30,020
- So much worse.

135
00:05:30,020 --> 00:05:31,180
- Your mommy should run around

136
00:05:31,180 --> 00:05:32,460
in fishnets around your house.

137
00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:38,900
Yeah, you could and you would be your mom's barefoot and you see any and you

138
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:42,100
know, it looks like I dropped your favorite toy under the table. Yeah.

139
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:44,900
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no. Okay.

140
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:49,000
No, it's like, you know, it's it's being a child again. It's looking at the

141
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,060
flashing lights. It's looking at the cow says, yeah, it's right. It says

142
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:56,820
clock. If this dude, if they had a cow says moo chicken says cluck slot. Oh my

143
00:05:56,820 --> 00:05:59,520
God I'm playing farmer Dan's banana.

144
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:01,420
That's the slot.

145
00:06:01,420 --> 00:06:05,520
It's I mean slots are essentially just baby Mozart for

146
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:06,020
alcohol.

147
00:06:06,020 --> 00:06:09,420
We can't yeah, we can't in the last episode.

148
00:06:09,420 --> 00:06:13,120
We did on the normal feed be like, hey, everybody go listen

149
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:14,220
to the patreon.

150
00:06:14,220 --> 00:06:15,320
It's great.

151
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:17,420
And then just also talk about the slots.

152
00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:21,420
New guy.

153
00:06:21,420 --> 00:06:22,120
Yeah.

154
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:26,020
Yeah, exactly with a person who like yeah, like you haven't

155
00:06:26,020 --> 00:06:27,140
heard us talk about slots.

156
00:06:27,140 --> 00:06:28,140
Yeah, no.

157
00:06:28,140 --> 00:06:29,860
So I'm just like, oh, this is exciting.

158
00:06:29,860 --> 00:06:30,860
I've heard this.

159
00:06:30,860 --> 00:06:31,620
Yeah.

160
00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:32,180
Well, yeah.

161
00:06:32,180 --> 00:06:35,300
That what's what's the pressing matter here is that we're trapped inside and

162
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:37,140
they're scary lightning. And I might pee myself.

163
00:06:37,140 --> 00:06:39,220
I just went and bought everyone pizza.

164
00:06:39,220 --> 00:06:41,140
You did do that. And it was very good.

165
00:06:41,140 --> 00:06:42,460
And all the cheese fell off.

166
00:06:42,460 --> 00:06:44,220
Yeah, the cheese was like falling.

167
00:06:44,220 --> 00:06:45,380
It was like it's fine.

168
00:06:45,380 --> 00:06:46,820
It was like like that.

169
00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:47,660
Mafia cheese.

170
00:06:47,660 --> 00:06:48,860
A lactose sludge.

171
00:06:48,860 --> 00:06:50,100
It was that's mafia cheese.

172
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:51,500
That's mafia cheese.

173
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:52,220
Not kidding. Yeah.

174
00:06:52,220 --> 00:06:53,940
So so I mean, I mean, whatever.

175
00:06:53,940 --> 00:06:55,340
So you're the you're the New York.

176
00:06:55,340 --> 00:06:58,700
I'm in New York Guinea. I mean this might be this might be apocryphal.

177
00:06:58,700 --> 00:07:01,020
I didn't want to say Guinea or Whopper.

178
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:01,780
You can say it.

179
00:07:01,780 --> 00:07:03,060
What's apocryphal?

180
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:07,020
I might this might be apocryphal Guinea bullshit but like

181
00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:11,500
apparently according to many members of my family that cheese that we that you

182
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:13,980
always see on pizza is like...

183
00:07:13,980 --> 00:07:15,260
It's called mozzarella.

184
00:07:15,260 --> 00:07:17,420
[laughter]

185
00:07:17,420 --> 00:07:19,660
And it goes over the sauce.

186
00:07:19,660 --> 00:07:21,020
It's like mob cheese.

187
00:07:21,020 --> 00:07:27,380
It's like, it's like, basically like, mobsters were like, like, if you want to have, like,

188
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:32,120
good mozzadel, fuck you, you're gonna get this cheap bullshit, we'll give it to you in bulk,

189
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:35,320
and we'll protect you, or whatever.

190
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:42,040
And then like, places like, um, Spumoni Gardens back in the day, or like, uh, this place where

191
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:46,400
I'm from, called Salvatore's, it's really good, where they have like, real mozzadel.

192
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:47,400
You're from El Salvador?

193
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:49,660
(laughing)

194
00:07:49,660 --> 00:07:50,500
- Wow.

195
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:51,960
- I've completely read you wrong.

196
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:53,360
- That explains everything.

197
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:56,280
- No, it wouldn't explain anything.

198
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:58,280
- Yeah, you have a tropical vibe now.

199
00:07:58,280 --> 00:07:59,120
- It would explain a lot of stuff.

200
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:01,720
- Is El Salvador famously tropical?

201
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:02,560
- I don't know.

202
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:04,600
- I'm asking the group here.

203
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:06,800
- You're asking the wrong people.

204
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:08,600
- Yeah, I've pretty much been there a million times.

205
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:09,440
- Yeah, no.

206
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:11,860
- I'm quite familiar too with several of the statistics

207
00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:14,040
about it and different factoids.

208
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:14,880
- It's actually, you know what,

209
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:16,600
it's Spanish for the Salvador.

210
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:17,700
It is true.

211
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:18,200
Mm-hmm.

212
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:24,900
Yeah, but yeah, so that cheese is supposed supposedly is mob cheese, but I fucking love I'll eat it.

213
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:27,100
I'll eat it when it's like all balled up and shit.

214
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:27,600
Oh, yeah.

215
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:30,200
I mean you live knob cheese the goop knob cheese.

216
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:31,100
Really?

217
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:32,600
It's cheese on your knob.

218
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:34,300
They then put it on the pizza.

219
00:08:34,300 --> 00:08:34,800
Yeah.

220
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:35,400
Yeah, it's called.

221
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:36,700
It's also called smegma.

222
00:08:36,700 --> 00:08:39,200
Yeah, your glob is cheese.

223
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:41,700
Yeah, my globby smegma is my cheese.

224
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:42,600
What the?

225
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:44,700
I don't make the rules.

226
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:45,800
It's like an Italian thing.

227
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:47,800
It's culture, alright?

228
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:48,800
Sounds horrible.

229
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:49,800
You would eat bog cheese?

230
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:51,800
I mean, I'd eat bog cheese.

231
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:52,800
You would eat bog cheese?

232
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:53,800
Yeah.

233
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:54,800
Cheese from a bog?

234
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:55,800
What's bog cheese?

235
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:56,800
Cheese from the bog body.

236
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:57,800
Cheese from a bog.

237
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:58,800
From a bog body?

238
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:02,800
Yeah, they milk the bog body and they make cheese out of bog milk.

239
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:08,800
Alright, what's like, what's an animal that makes milk that you would not eat the cheese from?

240
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:10,800
What if, what if, like a kangaroo?

241
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,800
I think I would eat cheese from any, I would eat kangaroo cheese.

242
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:14,800
I would eat probably any cheese.

243
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:17,000
I mean, can I see how the waters have milk?

244
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,080
Goat cheese.

245
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:18,920
No, they do.

246
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:20,160
They know mammals.

247
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:21,200
They're not all mammals.

248
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:22,000
Got milk.

249
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,680
They got they got milk from something.

250
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:25,840
Why the fuck is it with mammals?

251
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:28,320
So like a whale is a whale make milk.

252
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:29,360
Yeah, I think so.

253
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:32,000
No, yeah, if it's a whale makes ambergris.

254
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:38,320
What if one day what if you know this is this is a sidebar here,

255
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:40,040
but you know, like, oh, see the ice man.

256
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:42,640
Like, you know, they find like an old body preserved in ice.

257
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:46,080
Like what if when they thought him out like he was the juice man.

258
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:50,640
Yeah and they thought him out and he just immediately like just squirted cum everywhere the second

259
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:51,640
that he got out of the ice.

260
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:52,640
Like he was just stuck in the middle.

261
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:53,640
He got black frozen.

262
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:54,640
He got frozen right in the middle of having sex.

263
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:55,640
He pulled out.

264
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:56,640
He pulled out and the woman.

265
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:57,640
It just gets the woman.

266
00:09:57,640 --> 00:09:58,640
The woman.

267
00:09:58,640 --> 00:09:59,640
The woman.

268
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:00,640
The scientist right in the face.

269
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:01,640
The ice queen that he was fucking.

270
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:02,640
Yeah.

271
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:04,360
Blasted freeze out of her pussy on him.

272
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:09,880
As a general rule whale milk is rich in fats and comes in very large quantities.

273
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:10,880
Sounds great.

274
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:11,880
Oh okay.

275
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:14,540
has the largest mammary glands on earth.

276
00:10:14,540 --> 00:10:15,380
- Oh my god.

277
00:10:15,380 --> 00:10:16,960
- Do you have a photo?

278
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:19,740
- Each is about 1.5 meters long.

279
00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:20,860
- What's the cup size?

280
00:10:20,860 --> 00:10:23,280
- And weighs as much as a baby elephant.

281
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:24,520
(laughing)

282
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:28,620
I like comparing a whale's tits to like another huge--

283
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:31,040
- I wanna be crushed by those.

284
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:31,880
- I wanna see that.

285
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:33,780
- Why don't they poke out?

286
00:10:33,780 --> 00:10:34,800
Why don't they poke 'em out?

287
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:37,220
- Maybe that's why you can't like,

288
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:39,100
like whalemur in Pokemon, you can't go under--

289
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:41,040
- No, that's why you're not allowed to kill whales.

290
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:49,680
yeah their tits are so huge okay hold on I don't know what this is okay hold on

322
00:13:34,940 --> 00:13:37,980
next time well the first time I'm saying that cuz I know for a fact there'll be a

323
00:13:37,980 --> 00:13:41,860
next time right and I know I will knock Patrick out it'll be like well why'd you

324
00:13:41,860 --> 00:13:47,340
do that like I told you weeks before the first time I did it I was sober that's

325
00:13:47,340 --> 00:13:55,180
when we went to Central Park together and then we were on the train and I told you like,

326
00:13:55,180 --> 00:13:56,180
"Oh, what's that sign?"

327
00:13:56,180 --> 00:13:59,100
Oh yeah, you guys did get into a slap fight in the train station.

328
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:00,100
That was funny.

329
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:01,100
Yeah.

330
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:02,980
And then I guess I did it in Atlantic City too.

331
00:14:02,980 --> 00:14:07,420
I guess I did it in Atlantic City.

332
00:14:07,420 --> 00:14:09,620
What was the context for that one?

333
00:14:09,620 --> 00:14:13,740
I slapped your phone out of your hand and then you slapped me and then we were in a

334
00:14:13,740 --> 00:14:18,460
war and then we walked into a you just want me to tell you say this part that's

335
00:14:18,460 --> 00:14:26,380
why you know we talked about this like yesterday what happened is we walked

336
00:14:26,380 --> 00:14:30,300
into an elevator with three older black

337
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:42,100
was yeah enough to slap Kayla and then and then Patrick and this is this is so

338
00:14:42,100 --> 00:14:45,740
funny right as we were leaving the elevator I was like well we're safe

339
00:14:45,740 --> 00:14:49,140
there's three old ladies here there's no way that he's gonna slap me in the face

340
00:14:49,140 --> 00:14:54,220
as soon as the elevator opens he says you got something it doesn't even finish it

341
00:14:54,220 --> 00:15:00,540
slaps me in the face and just runs off. He didn't he slapped me. As a third party here I can tell you

342
00:15:00,540 --> 00:15:04,140
very funny because he did not slap you in the face he slapped you in the side

343
00:15:04,140 --> 00:15:07,620
of the head and he did it so hard that his hand followed through and also hit

344
00:15:07,620 --> 00:15:15,300
the wall of the elevator. And then one of the ladies went, "Oh my god."

345
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:18,660
Wait, so he said he ran off. Where did he go?

346
00:15:18,660 --> 00:15:19,660
I went to...

347
00:15:19,660 --> 00:15:22,220
You ran out of the elevator.

348
00:15:22,220 --> 00:15:26,100
I ran to like the right and it was like...

349
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:27,580
He knows I can't go right.

350
00:15:27,580 --> 00:15:30,420
I have a very weak right side.

351
00:15:30,420 --> 00:15:34,980
I ran to the right and there was just more elevators and I went, "Oh fuck."

352
00:15:34,980 --> 00:15:36,580
I walked out and you were trapped.

353
00:15:36,580 --> 00:15:41,780
I was like, if he could get me right now, I'd be done.

354
00:15:41,780 --> 00:15:43,940
It's not, at some point, I'm not going to get you, dude.

355
00:15:43,940 --> 00:15:45,740
I'm going to beat you up.

356
00:15:45,740 --> 00:15:50,700
Well, okay, then what was, I don't remember why I slapped you last night.

357
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:54,140
All I remember is you pulling me aside and being like, "It was funny in Atlantic City,

358
00:15:54,140 --> 00:15:55,140
but you can't do that again."

359
00:15:55,140 --> 00:15:59,380
I didn't pull you aside, I kicked you out of my house.

360
00:15:59,380 --> 00:16:01,500
I wasn't friendly, like, "Hey, man."

361
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:03,940
I just said, "Get the fuck out."

362
00:16:03,940 --> 00:16:05,540
I pulled you all the way aside.

363
00:16:05,540 --> 00:16:08,540
I forgot you kicked me out of the house.

364
00:16:08,540 --> 00:16:13,900
Yeah, that's... You know what I did? I did go. You know what? I went too far and I'm

365
00:16:13,900 --> 00:16:17,940
gonna apologize. I'm telling you, you can do it again. I'd be happy to

366
00:16:17,940 --> 00:16:22,020
punch you really fucking hard in the face. I would love to knock you out.

367
00:16:22,020 --> 00:16:25,020
Why? I mean like, I don't know, it'd be fun.

368
00:16:25,020 --> 00:16:31,260
Like the joy you get from like slapping me like a girl, like I would get ten times

369
00:16:31,260 --> 00:16:33,500
that from like actually hurting you so bad.

370
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:40,220
Why? Because I'm just telling you it'd be good, it'd be like really fun for me. So keep that in mind

371
00:16:40,220 --> 00:16:42,660
next time you think about slapping me like Caleb's gonna beat me up and he's

372
00:16:42,660 --> 00:16:47,140
gonna really enjoy it. Uh-huh. Yeah and I might actually wear like a big gold chain while I do it too.

373
00:16:47,140 --> 00:16:51,180
That's the thing, that's the thing like I don't know like I feel like if it's something you're

374
00:16:51,180 --> 00:16:55,320
really gonna enjoy maybe I'll like end up doing it just to just to make the

375
00:16:55,320 --> 00:17:05,000
friendship stronger I'm open to that yeah that's fine I'll probably slap

376
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:11,160
patches yeah I don't think I think you and I I'll just I be immediately be you

377
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:16,440
and I you if I ever you try to dude you use the you know you're I'm afraid of

378
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:21,560

379
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:28,120
Patches, I can tell when you're getting too rowdy too and I'll just stay more than arm's

380
00:17:28,120 --> 00:17:29,120
distance away from you.

381
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:30,120
Oh no, not you.

382
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:32,560
I mean, you've all seen me get way too rowdy before.

383
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:38,320
I had a distinct memory of getting into fights a lot as a kid.

384
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:40,800
Like very emotional kid, getting into fights all the time.

385
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:46,960
And then one time I was at, I used to wrestle, so I was at like a wrestling camp.

386
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:52,160
I told this like kid who was being annoying to me, I said "Fuck off, nobody likes you"

387
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:55,840
and he walked away and he told his older brother that I punched him in the face.

388
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:57,360
Which I didn't do.

389
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:57,860
Oh shit.

390
00:17:57,860 --> 00:17:59,960
And so then his older brother started wailing on me.

391
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:05,360
And this was like the textbook like your dad saying, "Hey, if somebody hits you first,

392
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:10,920
you have every right to hit them back." And I just like let him hit me. I had like a complete turn.

393
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:15,640
I had like been starting fights my whole life and then all of a sudden that like when somebody did it to me,

394
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:22,780
I was like this is awful I can't believe I just let him hit me it was like a crazy

395
00:18:22,780 --> 00:18:26,080
I think they're like not like a mercy thing I wasn't like I'm like you're

396
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:29,860
turning the other she no I was just like I was like this is really bad oh my god

397
00:18:29,860 --> 00:18:35,060
yeah it's very intense I think the first fight I was ever technically in I was

398
00:18:35,060 --> 00:18:41,640
like 11 years old and this kid was like like I goes with my friend Desmond and

399
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:45,300
this kid in his neighborhood like started like I guess he knew before so

400
00:18:45,300 --> 00:18:51,000
like screaming some like very like racist shit at this dude and...

401
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,300
You were screaming racist shit?

402
00:18:52,300 --> 00:18:56,300
No, my friend Desmond and so we like had to we like got up in his face

403
00:18:56,300 --> 00:18:59,300
we were like "Oh fuck you, fuck you" and then the kid just...

404
00:18:59,300 --> 00:19:00,800
Wait, who was screaming the racist shit?

405
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:04,300
Some random kid was screaming it at this kid Desmond that I was friends with.

406
00:19:04,300 --> 00:19:08,800
I thought you were saying you had to some your friend Desmond screamed some racist shit at somebody

407
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:12,300
and you were like "I guess I gotta go kill him."

408
00:19:12,300 --> 00:19:17,500
No, so I then then like we got in the kid's face and we were like and I'd never been in a fight before really and

409
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:23,660
So I just was like I'm you know, like no, we're not gonna I'm 11. I'm not gonna get beat up. So I

410
00:19:23,660 --> 00:19:30,420
Was we were like, yeah, man, like fuck you like do something and the second I said do something he punched me

411
00:19:30,420 --> 00:19:36,180
Yeah directly in the face like how like how nobody actually punches he punch make a shark go away

412
00:19:38,540 --> 00:19:42,900
Chipped all of my front teeth and then my friend Desmond

413
00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:45,420
Just like beat this kid to death

414
00:19:45,420 --> 00:19:50,120
And then we I like spit out all my teeth and like Desmond got up and he was like

415
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:53,280
Man, I had to like I just step in for you and I was like

416
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:55,800
Why don't you do that before I got fucking punched?

417
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:57,820
What the fuck is that?

418
00:19:57,820 --> 00:20:01,900
I never got in a fight before cuz like I would probably just kill them and I'd have to go to jail

419
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:05,020
It's a really good point. Yeah, so I just try not to do what you would use

420
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:11,100
you had a superpower yeah yeah yeah you would kill you would fucking kamehameha

421
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:17,280
somebody sit there and scream until they exploded yeah I might accidentally like

422
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:23,100
release dark magic I don't like it yeah you would you would be crouching down

423
00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:35,140
you would you would turn into the witch from Left 4 Dead someone else would like

424
00:20:35,140 --> 00:20:40,740
walk through the alley that you got into the fight in and just see you

425
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:42,740
Cameron fuck!

426
00:20:42,740 --> 00:20:47,740
This guy spending any fucking time in an alleyway as a kid.

427
00:20:47,740 --> 00:20:48,740
What?

428
00:20:48,740 --> 00:20:51,740
He was low down and tumble.

429
00:20:51,740 --> 00:20:53,740
He was rough fucked and fumbled.

430
00:20:53,740 --> 00:20:54,740
I forgot about C-Money.

431
00:20:54,740 --> 00:20:55,740
You forgot about Killacam.

432
00:20:55,740 --> 00:20:57,740
Yeah, Killacam C-Money.

433
00:20:57,740 --> 00:20:58,740
Who did you think he was talking to?

434
00:20:58,740 --> 00:21:01,740
There was another guy named Cameron at my school who was a white rapper

435
00:21:01,740 --> 00:21:04,300
who his rap name was Killa Trill.

436
00:21:04,300 --> 00:21:05,140
- Hell yeah.

437
00:21:05,140 --> 00:21:06,980
- What a fucking, what a missed layup.

438
00:21:06,980 --> 00:21:07,820
- So cool, dude.

439
00:21:07,820 --> 00:21:08,640
- What a dumbass.

440
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:09,480
- Let's censor that out,

441
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:10,320
I don't want any free press for the guy.

442
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:12,480
- He quit his rap career.

443
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:14,300
- Oh, he's dead, yeah.

444
00:21:14,300 --> 00:21:15,620
- I don't know what happened to him.

445
00:21:15,620 --> 00:21:17,940
I tried so many times to find the Killa Trill songs,

446
00:21:17,940 --> 00:21:18,780
I could not find them.

447
00:21:18,780 --> 00:21:20,260
- Oh dude, it was so, I mean,

448
00:21:20,260 --> 00:21:22,020
you go to like predominantly,

449
00:21:22,020 --> 00:21:24,180
like a predominantly white high school

450
00:21:24,180 --> 00:21:25,020
and you're seeing how many kids

451
00:21:25,020 --> 00:21:25,860
became like soundbite rappers.

452
00:21:25,860 --> 00:21:27,300
- Yeah, oh yeah.

453
00:21:27,300 --> 00:21:28,140
- So fucking cool.

454
00:21:28,140 --> 00:21:28,980
- Could have been me, man.

455
00:21:28,980 --> 00:21:31,100
My mom didn't pull me out, I would have done that.

456
00:21:31,100 --> 00:21:32,100
have done that so fast.

457
00:21:32,100 --> 00:21:34,100
Yeah, it's not even a question that you would have done it.

458
00:21:34,100 --> 00:21:36,100
Yeah, but you would have been like a conscious rapper.

459
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:37,100
No way.

460
00:21:37,100 --> 00:21:38,100
You would have been like most definitely.

461
00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:41,100
I'm sure if I had like a few more friends I would have ended up like that.

462
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:44,100
You would have converted to hip hop.

463
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:47,100
No, actually being homeschooled made me a conscious rapper.

464
00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:50,100
I would have been out there saying drugs, money, hoes.

465
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:51,100
Oh yeah.

466
00:21:51,100 --> 00:21:52,100
If it weren't for...

467
00:21:52,100 --> 00:21:55,900
Just the idea of like some like high school like soundcloud rapper like in a predominantly

468
00:21:55,900 --> 00:22:00,700
white school just he decides he wants to be a rapper so he just like but he's only like

469
00:22:00,700 --> 00:22:06,120
He like loves like most effort like tell quality. Yeah, it just becomes just like he's just like yeah, I'm like

470
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:11,220
Yeah, call me you said yeah, he's walking up to like

Nah, not for me

476
00:22:35,940 --> 00:22:43,220
Like the white SoundCloud rapper kid just immediately just like all right just made my SoundCloud account and

477
00:22:43,220 --> 00:22:47,300
I am going to read the Quran

478
00:22:47,300 --> 00:22:49,300
Yeah, yeah

Haven't made the song yet

480
00:22:51,420 --> 00:22:53,420
But if you're reading the Quran

481
00:22:53,420 --> 00:22:58,180
So because you have to become Muslim you have to like know everything about Islam before you make a read

482
00:22:58,180 --> 00:23:03,300
If you're gonna convert like you got a little make if you want a quiet dog I

483
00:23:03,300 --> 00:23:07,980
Just mean like in general like if you're gonna like or mathematics

484
00:23:07,980 --> 00:23:13,380
It's such a funny thing where it's like if you if you grow up with something you're allowed to be lapsed and whatever that is

485
00:23:13,380 --> 00:23:18,100
Yeah, no and no like 20% of it and act like an authority on it. Oh, yeah

486
00:23:18,100 --> 00:23:24,940
Yeah, if you convert it's like like yo, you weren't like forced to do this. You got to know. Mm-hmm all of it

487
00:23:24,940 --> 00:23:27,660
It's like becoming a citizen. It's like yeah, it's like like well

488
00:23:27,660 --> 00:23:31,980
Well I wasn't raised Muslim and I didn't convert either but I know pretty much everything there

yeah dude that's like that's the best part about like any other like religion

504
00:25:00,780 --> 00:25:05,100
you change to you mostly have to keep your name yeah Islam you make up an

505
00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:10,020
awesome fucking Megatron name. That's amazing that makes you feel like like you own it

506
00:25:10,020 --> 00:25:14,700
it's your name yeah exactly your dumbass parents didn't pick it for you exactly

507
00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:17,980
because you're born again like I think Christianity should have that.

508
00:25:17,980 --> 00:25:21,300
We are born again Christians you don't change your name though.

509
00:25:21,300 --> 00:25:24,460
In Catholicism you don't get to change your name.

510
00:25:24,460 --> 00:25:27,420
You have a confirmation name though.

511
00:25:27,420 --> 00:25:34,440
I know but like you never don't get like yeah, you know, it's not like like like, you know, Cat Stevens converting

512
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:40,480
Yes, exactly. It's not like, you know, it's not like that but like I know what would the Catholicism names did you get confirmed man?

513
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:44,200
No, I I wasn't really allowed in church as a kid

514
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:46,540
I

515
00:25:46,540 --> 00:25:52,900
Was to ADHD. I think I went to I went to church a couple times and then my mom watched the passion

516
00:25:52,900 --> 00:25:59,020
and my mom watched the passion got like very like into Christ again mm-hmm and

517
00:25:59,020 --> 00:26:06,460
all right yeah I think she yeah she got like really into fucking God and shit

518
00:26:06,460 --> 00:26:12,300
yes and tried to like take us to church I went to like God and the Holy Spirit

519
00:26:12,300 --> 00:26:18,380
and racism but she got really into that and then like she tried to take me to my

520
00:26:18,380 --> 00:26:22,060
cousin's confirmation and I had to sit in the quiet room and the whole time I'm

521
00:26:22,060 --> 00:26:25,220
in the quiet room I was sitting there like this is so boring.

522
00:26:25,220 --> 00:26:26,020
You're right.

523
00:26:26,020 --> 00:26:26,740
This sucks.

524
00:26:26,740 --> 00:26:27,740
Confirmation is boring.

525
00:26:27,740 --> 00:26:30,740
I just want to go home and I want to eat snacks because they're

526
00:26:30,740 --> 00:26:32,100
having a big like party after.

527
00:26:32,100 --> 00:26:32,420
Yeah.

528
00:26:32,420 --> 00:26:33,540
And we got in the car.

529
00:26:33,540 --> 00:26:35,460
I think I've probably talked about this before, but we got in

530
00:26:35,460 --> 00:26:35,780
the car.

531
00:26:35,780 --> 00:26:39,420
My mom turned to me and went like, I can't believe you did that

532
00:26:39,420 --> 00:26:40,940
in the house of God.

533
00:26:40,940 --> 00:26:42,420
I.

534
00:26:42,420 --> 00:26:44,660
That scared me like out of.

535
00:26:44,660 --> 00:26:45,260
Oh yeah.

536
00:26:45,260 --> 00:26:50,580
Confirmation like was so my high school was like I think I think

537
00:26:50,580 --> 00:26:55,300
I said this on on a little bit, not that much, though a little bit on Pindeo time, though,

538
00:26:55,300 --> 00:26:59,220
when I was on there, but like my high school was extremely Catholic.

539
00:26:59,220 --> 00:27:03,300
So like it was a public high school, but like almost everybody there was Catholic.

540
00:27:03,300 --> 00:27:07,540
So when you're leading up to your confirmation, you were going to like religious education

541
00:27:07,540 --> 00:27:09,620
every week and it's every Tuesday.

542
00:27:09,620 --> 00:27:16,540
And so like the entire eighth grade would just like leave, except for like five, like

543
00:27:16,660 --> 00:27:21,660
like Protestant kids and one Jew would just have to stay for ninth period.

544
00:27:21,660 --> 00:27:24,220
And then like every other kid would leave.

545
00:27:24,220 --> 00:27:26,900
And so you would just like, it was like this weird fucked up thing where like all

546
00:27:26,900 --> 00:27:29,740
the teachers were like completely helpless to stop it.

547
00:27:29,740 --> 00:27:31,780
And that was leading up to the confirmation thing.

548
00:27:31,780 --> 00:27:33,540
But they should have stopped those damn Protestants.

549
00:27:33,540 --> 00:27:33,860
Yeah.

550
00:27:33,860 --> 00:27:39,580
Confirmation party was tight, but like the confirmation itself is so fucking boring.

551
00:27:39,580 --> 00:27:41,820
Oh dude, it's the most boring shit in the world.

552
00:27:41,820 --> 00:27:44,820
You sit there and like the fucking, the priest sits there.

553
00:27:44,820 --> 00:27:48,360
He's like, "Oh, I'm also with you."

554
00:27:48,360 --> 00:27:51,360
Yeah, it sucks.

555
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:52,100
Yeah. Oh my God.

556
00:27:52,100 --> 00:27:55,300
You got to say it back to him in the same fucking intonation.

557
00:27:55,300 --> 00:27:55,720
Oh, yeah.

558
00:27:55,720 --> 00:27:57,220
Church is awesome.

559
00:27:57,220 --> 00:27:58,960
Oh, you were a fucking Baptist.

560
00:27:58,960 --> 00:27:59,300
Yeah, dude.

561
00:27:59,300 --> 00:28:02,460
There's like an older girl who always wanted to see my feet.

562
00:28:02,460 --> 00:28:06,560
Maybe I should have become Baptist.

563
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:08,300
Yeah, it does sound better.

564
00:28:08,300 --> 00:28:09,100
It's pretty awesome, dude.

565
00:28:09,100 --> 00:28:10,360
For us, it was older men.

566
00:28:10,360 --> 00:28:14,400
Yeah, it's older men and they're like, "If you tell anybody, I'll fucking kill you."

567
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:20,880
Yeah, no, I just got like, I got like sexually harassed by like a like a hot high school girl. Yeah, right. Yeah. Oh

568
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:28,760
My god, that's so I was like 13. She was like, do you wanna like take your socks off? I was like, no

569
00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:35,840
That is very weird that like an older girl really wanted you to know I was really yeah

570
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:41,500
No, she also I found out later that she she used to sleep in a bed full of like a living roaches

571
00:28:41,500 --> 00:28:48,500
is

572
00:28:48,500 --> 00:28:55,500
you

573
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:58,620
No, she was just like another, like my mom was like

574
00:28:58,620 --> 00:29:01,180
always like involved in church. She was your other mom?

575
00:29:01,180 --> 00:29:04,620
And she, her mom was also involved in church so we'd end up like

576
00:29:04,620 --> 00:29:08,740
Sure. You know, both like working like the babysitting shit at church or something

577
00:29:08,740 --> 00:29:13,700
or like be like handing out all the food on like the cookout days and shit

578
00:29:13,700 --> 00:29:17,580
and yeah she was always like, "Yeah, you should show me your feet."

579
00:29:17,580 --> 00:29:20,740
What the fuck? Don't really... Have you said this on the pod?

580
00:29:20,740 --> 00:29:24,700
No. Alright. Probably shouldn't have.

581
00:29:24,700 --> 00:29:27,500
But I did resist, like I never showed her my feet.

582
00:29:27,500 --> 00:29:28,500
Good.

583
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:30,180
I would have showed them immediately.

584
00:29:30,180 --> 00:29:31,180
That's not right.

585
00:29:31,180 --> 00:29:32,180
You're weak.

586
00:29:32,180 --> 00:29:39,740
Yeah, but I also was, I was, you know, I was an active enough kid who as far as jacking

587
00:29:39,740 --> 00:29:42,580
off at the computer went that I knew that that was bad news immediately.

588
00:29:42,580 --> 00:29:43,580
Yeah, absolutely.

589
00:29:43,580 --> 00:29:47,180
You know, like someone asks to see your feet, you say, "Hell no, you turn the other way."

590
00:29:47,180 --> 00:29:48,180
Yeah.

591
00:29:48,180 --> 00:29:50,180
Stranger comes up to you and says, "Can I see your feet?"

592
00:29:50,180 --> 00:29:51,500
Maybe that was just God testing you.

593
00:29:51,500 --> 00:29:53,100
Also, she was goth.

594
00:29:53,100 --> 00:29:54,100

00:30:49,100 --> 00:30:52,840
character we need to have a moment of silence up top for Brandon Lee yeah

608
00:30:56,860 --> 00:31:02,840
Wilmington North Carolina my uncle was on set when he died yeah my uncle was

613
00:31:30,420 --> 00:31:35,420
died. I can't... They shoot so many movies in Wilmington and he never told us because

614
00:31:35,420 --> 00:31:38,900
because he wants to hide his movie star past. I'm pretty much a Hollywood big shot.

615
00:31:38,900 --> 00:31:44,100
I didn't know that. Did you guys know that Wilmington is like a movie town? I know they shoot a lot of TV shows there.

616
00:31:44,100 --> 00:31:48,620
They shoot a bunch of movies. They used to but now in Atlanta there's more like tax breaks there.

617
00:31:48,620 --> 00:31:52,780
So they stole it. It was a tax break thing. I thought that was shot in Massachusetts.

618
00:31:52,780 --> 00:31:57,820
Dawson's Creek. Dawson's Creek is entirely in Wilmington? Yes sir. No shit. I have no idea.

619
00:31:57,820 --> 00:31:59,820

00:31:59,820 --> 00:32:05,100
It's pretty much it. Oh wait. What was you remember when in like 2012 where there was all those like

621
00:32:05,100 --> 00:32:12,540
NBC and ABC primetime primetime like dramas that were about like what if the fairy tales came to life?

622
00:32:12,540 --> 00:32:18,940
Yeah, like uh the bastard executioner and stuff grim grim was shot in wilmington. No, that's a different thing

He like he's in a car and he looks back over his shoulder and he saw me waving hi

00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:36,020
I know I know who he's talking about, but I want to hear my face. I swear to God. It's the question

663
00:34:36,020 --> 00:34:40,140
He wears a his name is the question, but was you let's go the question. I know yes, okay

664
00:34:40,140 --> 00:34:47,520
Who is let's hear let's hear if he wears a detective. He's an old super hero. He's who Rorschach was based off from watchman

665
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:49,920
Oh, he's based off another guy.

666
00:34:49,920 --> 00:34:51,920
He looked exactly like the question mark man.

667
00:34:51,920 --> 00:34:55,120
Yeah, the question mark man tells a lot of riddles.

668
00:34:55,120 --> 00:34:56,720
That's the riddler.

669
00:34:56,720 --> 00:34:57,320
No.

670
00:34:57,320 --> 00:34:59,720
No, the riddler tells all those jokes.

671
00:34:59,720 --> 00:35:01,220
I'm thinking of Slender Man.

672
00:35:01,220 --> 00:35:02,320
Oh, okay.

673
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:04,920
Yeah, the guy who teaches you how to be thin.

674
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:08,320
I will say there was three weeks where I was like, "Really?"

675
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:11,320
Yeah, I was terrified of Slender Man for a while.

676
00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:13,120
I thought Slender Man was real.

677
00:35:13,120 --> 00:35:14,460
(laughing)

678
00:35:14,460 --> 00:35:16,400
- I didn't know, when I was a kid,

679
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:19,740
my mom told me he wore a toupee, Jon Bastow.

680
00:35:19,740 --> 00:35:23,280
And as soon as I saw that commercial,

681
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:25,200
immediately after, I realized--

682
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:26,360
- I don't think I even thought of that.

683
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:27,360
That is so real.

684
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:30,760
- Yeah, oh, he wears the fucking craziest hairpiece.

685
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:32,160
- That is 100% what that is.

686
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:35,180
- Yeah, as soon as she told me that, I was like,

687
00:35:35,180 --> 00:35:40,120
what the, no, how does it stay on on this machine?

688
00:35:40,120 --> 00:35:41,520
Like, that means it would sweat the hair off.

689
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:44,520
Did you guys ever see the Fitness Made Simple infomercials?

690
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:45,520
No.

691
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:49,200
He's Sean Bay style and he's gonna show you how.

692
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:50,640
Wow, holy shit.

693
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:51,640
What a weird overlap.

694
00:35:51,640 --> 00:35:53,720
You know what was a great commercial that always would come on?

695
00:35:53,720 --> 00:35:56,080
You guys ever see a commercial for the Hover Round?

696
00:35:56,080 --> 00:35:57,080
Yeah.

697
00:35:57,080 --> 00:36:01,520
And the guy who's like the CEO of Hover Round, his name is Tom Cruise.

698
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:03,520
But Cruise is spelled different.

699
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:07,520
So we would come out and be like, "Hi, I'm Tom Cruise."

700
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:09,780
(laughter)

701
00:36:09,780 --> 00:36:11,620
- Tom Cruise in Adventure of the Hover.

702
00:36:11,620 --> 00:36:13,720
- It would be funny if they also just lied

703
00:36:13,720 --> 00:36:15,020
about his name.

704
00:36:15,020 --> 00:36:15,860
- Yeah.

705
00:36:15,860 --> 00:36:17,120
- That they were trying to get him on the show.

706
00:36:17,120 --> 00:36:19,040
- I trust it, I trust that that's his real name.

707
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:19,880
- That's definitely his name.

708
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:20,720
- Yeah.

709
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:22,240
- It's like Tom Cruise, like C-R-U-Z.

710
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:23,240
- I think if you're--

711
00:36:23,240 --> 00:36:26,800
- Tom Cruise's real name is not Tom Cruise, I think.

712
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:27,640
- What?

713
00:36:27,640 --> 00:36:29,600
- Well, I'll confirm that right now.

714
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:30,760
- Fact check that, please.

715
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:31,600
- I got you.

716
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:33,240
- I think Tom Cruise is a stage name.

717
00:36:33,240 --> 00:36:34,800
I don't think that's his real name.

718
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:37,040
- It is, it does sound like a stage name.

719
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:37,880
- Yeah.

720
00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:39,280
- That's kind of smart to change your name

721
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:41,720
to a misspelling of a famous person's name.

722
00:36:41,720 --> 00:36:45,040
- Thomas Cruz Mapother the fourth.

723
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:46,000
- Mm-hmm.

724
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:46,840
- Yep.

725
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:48,280
- Mapother?

726
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:49,120
- Mapletherp.

727
00:36:49,120 --> 00:36:51,400
- I mean, maybe Mapotherp.

728
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:52,240
- How do you spell it?

729
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:53,520
- It's a horrible name.

730
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:54,920
M-A-P-O-

731
00:36:54,920 --> 00:36:56,760
- He changed his name, he changed his teeth.

732
00:36:56,760 --> 00:36:59,480
- M-A-P-O-T-H-E-R.

733
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:00,560
- Wow.

734
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:01,400
- Yeah.

735
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:02,220
- Mapother.

736
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:03,060
- That's what I was looking at.

737
00:37:03,060 --> 00:37:03,900
- Mapother.

738
00:37:03,900 --> 00:37:04,720
- I was thinking Mapother.

739
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:05,560
- Tom Mapother.

740
00:37:05,560 --> 00:37:07,560
Tommy old Tommy Muputher the fourth.

741
00:37:07,560 --> 00:37:09,560
Tommy Muputher?

742
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:11,560
That's a completely different guy.

743
00:37:11,560 --> 00:37:13,560
I can see, I can see like...

744
00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:15,560
Well I think he would have a very different career path.

745
00:37:15,560 --> 00:37:17,560
Yeah exactly. I guess...

746
00:37:17,560 --> 00:37:20,560
Tommy Muputher I think if he didn't change his teeth he'd be like a Willem Dafoe like character.

747
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:24,560
Yeah. He would maybe be a guy who just played guys who lived in a swamp or bog.

748
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:26,560
Well why is his middle name Cruz?

749
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:29,560
Probably because of how much his dad liked to drive boats.

750
00:37:29,560 --> 00:37:31,560
Probably because of Cuba.

751
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:32,560
Yeah man.

752
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:33,560
Probably because of Cuba.

753
00:37:33,560 --> 00:37:38,200
dad's name was Thomas Cruz Mappa third of third. That's true yeah. And what was his

754
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:42,640
grandpa's name? And what about his grandpa's grandpa? Yeah. I think we got it.

755
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:48,800
Saul guys. Well his grandpa's grandpa was Zinu. His father took a job as a defense

756
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:53,480
consultant with the Canadian Armed Forces. Oh isn't he? Yeah Tom

757
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:59,680
Cruz is Canadian right? Is he? He's born in Syracuse New York. Okay yeah yeah

758
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:05,120
fucking like a like guy who's pretty far north. Do you guys remember when Billy Mays died?

759
00:38:05,120 --> 00:38:07,680
Yeah. Yeah. That was so fucked up. That was sad.

760
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:12,160
Billy Mays, dude I can't find the photo anywhere but I was Billy Mays for Halloween when I was 12.

761
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:17,600
You should be like the fact that you blew that when you were 12 and not like right now is such

762
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:22,400
a fucking shame. Well I think it was a funnier costume for a 12 year old to have. But it would

763
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:26,880
be such a good costume for you now. It would also be really funny if you maybe drew like

764
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:29,840
X's over your eyes when you did it and like I like war like

765
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:35,620
Like it look like they're flames. Yeah, yeah, and you held like it you held like

766
00:38:35,620 --> 00:38:40,040
Like a sad face on it

767
00:38:40,040 --> 00:38:44,920
Running into the fire

768
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:54,880
Fireplace I can't take it anymore. I'm Billy Mason. I'm gonna kill myself

769
00:38:54,880 --> 00:39:02,880
I'm so fucking sad. Billy Mays here, I'm gonna fucking dive my head into the corner of that brick.

770
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:08,880
Billy Mays here, I am about to asphyxiate for real. It's gonna end.

771
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:10,880
What are you doing?

772
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:16,880
In all seriousness, Billy Mays was a great man.

773
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:23,600
great man. He genuinely, genuinely one of the greatest men. And the way, and the horrible,

774
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:29,040
the horrible way he went out. I mean, it's tragic. It's so tragic. It's tragic. I gotta

775
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:32,960
find that fuck. I gotta ask my mom if she can ask around for that photo of me as Billy

776
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:37,960
Mays. And who is his, who is his British fucking replacement? Oh, Anthony Sullivan here. Anthony

777
00:39:37,960 --> 00:39:45,200
Sullivan here. Oh, Anthony Sullivan here for my buddy. Anthony Sullivan here, I'm worse.

778
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:46,880
I'm a much worse version.

779
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:47,600
Oh, man.

780
00:39:47,600 --> 00:39:47,960
Yeah.

781
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:50,920
I mean, no, I think I think Anthony had no cap.

782
00:39:50,920 --> 00:39:52,280
Fuck Anthony Sullivan.

783
00:39:52,280 --> 00:39:52,640
Really?

784
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:54,080
You're going to go that far.

785
00:39:54,080 --> 00:39:54,960
I even know who that was.

786
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:56,320
I know the Slap Chop guy.

787
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:56,720
That's it.

788
00:39:56,720 --> 00:39:58,280
No, I remember the Slap Chop.

789
00:39:58,280 --> 00:39:58,760
Yeah.

790
00:39:58,760 --> 00:39:59,240
Vince.

791
00:39:59,240 --> 00:40:00,320
Anthony Sullivan's a guy.

792
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:02,480
Vince Shlomi was Vince Offer's real name.

793
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:04,160
Vince Offer is such a good name.

794
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:06,560
He changed his name to Vince Offer when he became like a pitch man.

795
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:08,280
I think Vince Offer is like incredible.

796
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:09,840
Probably the best life you can live.

797
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:10,320
Oh, yeah.

798
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:10,600
Yeah.

799
00:40:10,600 --> 00:40:10,800
Sure.

800
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:11,480
What's that?

801
00:40:11,480 --> 00:40:11,960
What's that?

802
00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:14,300
(laughter)

803
00:40:14,300 --> 00:40:18,280
- What's that, oh, oh, Vince Offer,

804
00:40:18,280 --> 00:40:20,280
before he became the Pitch Man,

805
00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:22,760
he had a movie called The Underground Comedy Movie,

806
00:40:22,760 --> 00:40:24,340
which is like one of the worst fucking pieces

807
00:40:24,340 --> 00:40:26,480
of shit of all time, and then,

808
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:30,800
after that he made Inappropriate Comedy with--

809
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:32,680
- Oh, that's him. - Rob Schneider, yeah.

810
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:34,280
- Oh. - And he wrote and directed that.

811
00:40:34,280 --> 00:40:35,400
- Good for him. - Yeah, and then he--

812
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:38,000
- Wow. - Beat the shit out of a hooker.

813
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:38,840
- He did? - Yeah, you don't remember that?

814
00:40:38,840 --> 00:40:40,520
- Do you think he slap-chopped her?

815
00:40:40,520 --> 00:40:42,780
(laughter)

816
00:40:42,780 --> 00:40:46,180
- Look, you save that for 2008, when 2008 comes around,

817
00:40:46,180 --> 00:40:48,420
when 2008 comes back, that joke's gonna crush.

818
00:40:48,420 --> 00:40:50,660
(laughter)

819
00:40:50,660 --> 00:40:52,540
- Oh my God.

820
00:40:52,540 --> 00:40:55,780
- Yeah, I just like, I remember finding out that

821
00:40:55,780 --> 00:40:59,720
the Slap Chop guy was also a comedian when I was like 11.

822
00:40:59,720 --> 00:41:00,980
I was like, holy shit!

823
00:41:00,980 --> 00:41:03,580
- I think Slap Chop, I don't think I've ever seen

824
00:41:03,580 --> 00:41:05,720
the actual commercial, I think I've only seen the YouTube.

825
00:41:05,720 --> 00:41:06,560
- Yeah, me too.

826
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:08,920
- I saw the commercial a lot, a lot growing up.

827
00:41:08,920 --> 00:41:10,920
Yeah, I did too. Yeah, the Slapshot and the ShamWow.

828
00:41:10,920 --> 00:41:14,920
So I was always up at weird hours, like as a kid, like watching infomercials.

829
00:41:14,920 --> 00:41:16,920
Did you see the Girls Gone Wild, like New Orleans?

830
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:17,920
Oh my god, of course.

831
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:19,920
Yeah, the Comedy Central during the Secret Stash.

832
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:22,920
I mean, that's porn. That was porn that you could watch.

833
00:41:22,920 --> 00:41:26,920
Oh my god, I would get up at 5am and watch that and just go, "Ugh."

834
00:41:26,920 --> 00:41:29,920
Yeah, 'cause also, like, I can imagine what a nipple looks like.

835
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:34,920
Like, if you just make the nipple a little Comedy Central logo or whatever,

836
00:41:34,920 --> 00:41:36,920
I'm gonna, I mean, I'm gonna whack off.

837
00:41:36,920 --> 00:41:40,720
whenever I see the Comedy Central logo today I remember the first time I saw

838
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:47,780
boobs in real life I was like where's the logo I said I said put those fucking

839
00:41:47,780 --> 00:41:54,460
things away I tried to rip off the nipples to reveal the absolute watch

840
00:41:54,460 --> 00:41:59,840
you'd see how high and you they could say up to shit they couldn't say fuck

841
00:41:59,840 --> 00:42:04,580
yeah you say up to shit still censored everything else up then in between that

842
00:42:04,580 --> 00:42:09,740
in between like the bumpers that were like the Comedy Central secret stash and

843
00:42:09,740 --> 00:42:13,780
they put like the VHS yes into the VCR they would have the the girls gone wild

844
00:42:13,780 --> 00:42:20,600
commercials oh yeah and then like fucking dick pills yeah pill commercials and so

845
00:42:20,600 --> 00:42:24,140
cool is the girls in the shop calm the girls in those commercials always seem

846
00:42:24,140 --> 00:42:28,220
like so fucking happy yeah that was just like the best part of it for me they

847
00:42:28,220 --> 00:42:30,620
were they don't know because they don't know they don't know they're being

848
00:42:30,620 --> 00:42:34,980
exploited what yeah what are you talking about well it wasn't that the whole

849
00:42:34,980 --> 00:42:39,440
thing was a day like they sued like the guy who made that shit got sued a

850
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:45,860
million times cuz the girls were like I thought they were so happy they were so

851
00:42:45,860 --> 00:42:52,060
wild yeah yeah but they're like all that they sued them like like I thought that

852
00:42:52,060 --> 00:42:57,780
you were holding like a toaster it's awesome yeah there's just some freak

853
00:42:57,780 --> 00:43:02,020
holding a toaster yeah well you know what they say you know what they say though

854
00:43:02,020 --> 00:43:14,940
you know what they say well-behaved women rarely make history yeah now but

855
00:43:14,940 --> 00:43:19,980
that would also crush in 2008 yeah you joke that would do better in 2008 or

856
00:43:19,980 --> 00:43:25,860
you're so good now it's like a half-life you know yeah half-life you know yeah

857
00:43:25,860 --> 00:43:32,020
exactly yeah hey where's the third one yeah yeah yeah yeah it's not called

858
00:43:32,020 --> 00:43:36,500
halfway three so it doesn't count yeah that's fair yeah you guys play you have a

859
00:43:36,500 --> 00:43:40,600
VR that is it is like I know it yeah it is an old 2008 Chuck Rare but it's so

860
00:43:40,600 --> 00:43:43,980
funny they're like yeah we'll make we'll make like three more half-life games

861
00:43:43,980 --> 00:43:49,140
we're never making one of them called half-life 3 it's so it's like it is like

862
00:43:49,140 --> 00:43:53,660
ridiculous three is too cool a number like if you put three after something

863
00:43:53,660 --> 00:43:56,680
it's gonna be the expectations are gonna be so high.

864
00:43:56,680 --> 00:44:00,900
Well also there's no I think there's very seldomly been the third of something

865
00:44:00,900 --> 00:44:04,740
that was the best one. The second one is usually the best. No third is usually the

866
00:44:04,740 --> 00:44:11,300
best. Okay, sophomore shows. In terms of TV series, third season always the best.

867
00:44:11,300 --> 00:44:16,060
Movies and games I think third is usually the worst. Mm-hmm.

868
00:44:16,060 --> 00:44:21,020
Depends on how long this the I mean Halo 3. Halo 3 is the worst one. Halloween 3,

869
00:44:21,020 --> 00:44:23,020
Nightmare on Elm Street 3.

870
00:44:23,020 --> 00:44:25,020
Halloween 3 is great.

871
00:44:25,020 --> 00:44:27,020
Friday the 33. Exorcist 3.

872
00:44:27,020 --> 00:44:29,020
Texas Chainsaw 2.

873
00:44:29,020 --> 00:44:31,020
Star Wars Episode 3.

874
00:44:31,020 --> 00:44:33,020
Star Wars Episode 3 is a...

875
00:44:33,020 --> 00:44:35,020
Oh no. That's Revenge of the Sith.

876
00:44:35,020 --> 00:44:37,020
That's where like...

877
00:44:37,020 --> 00:44:39,020
Also Return of the Jedi.

878
00:44:39,020 --> 00:44:41,020
That counts as 3 too.

879
00:44:41,020 --> 00:44:43,020
That's the best of the prequels but it's not the best of the whole series.

880
00:44:43,020 --> 00:44:45,020
Revenge of the Sith is my favorite Star Wars movie.

881
00:44:45,020 --> 00:44:47,020
You go to the ring, you put them in chunks.

882
00:44:47,020 --> 00:44:49,020
And that's why Rises of Skywalker is the best one.

883
00:44:49,020 --> 00:44:51,020
Three?

884
00:44:51,020 --> 00:44:57,500
They're all really good though. Three's not bad. No, there's only there's a there's ten minutes that are cool. Blackadder season three?

885
00:44:57,500 --> 00:45:03,300
No, you're stupid. You're wrong. Blackadder season three? Blackaddam. Blackadder. Oh, I don't know what that is.

886
00:45:03,300 --> 00:45:06,340
The Rowan Atkinson show. The Rowan Atkinson British show. House of Cards.

887
00:45:06,340 --> 00:45:13,420
Horrible third season. I remember watching House of Cards. First two seasons, awesome. Third season, I mean. When House of Cards came out

888
00:45:13,420 --> 00:45:16,340
I was like something's wrong with this president character.

889
00:45:16,700 --> 00:45:21,060
The thing about that shows the first two seasons are like oh like this guy's like well

890
00:45:21,060 --> 00:45:25,260
I'm this guy's I am I am the rapist I am evil

891
00:45:25,260 --> 00:45:30,820
He's like kind of scary. He like sometimes kills people he's like, but he's like trying to do

892
00:45:30,820 --> 00:45:36,060
And then by the third season he's just his God and he could do anything he wants

893
00:45:36,060 --> 00:45:40,300
He's like starting wars and like adding like like it's crazy. Yeah

894
00:45:40,300 --> 00:45:44,820
I've added a 24th amendment that allows me to do whatever I want

895
00:45:45,460 --> 00:45:49,540
Pretty much. I feel like I feel like if you write that many hours of

896
00:45:49,540 --> 00:45:53,340
Like any story I get to know - yeah

897
00:45:53,340 --> 00:45:56,980
Well, you know what happened is is Kevin Spacey just kept going to the writers room was like

898
00:45:56,980 --> 00:46:00,180
What if I was just like God I could do anything I want like to anybody

899
00:46:00,180 --> 00:46:05,100
Yeah, sure

900
00:46:05,100 --> 00:46:08,400
Yeah, let's go to Chick-fil-a on Sunday

901
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:14,460
It's so sad that he was like one of the greatest impressionists of all time who can you was so fucking good really good

902
00:46:14,900 --> 00:46:20,740
Insanely lost a huge talent. Yeah, all right. P. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah should be killed

903
00:46:20,740 --> 00:46:26,780
But first you have to do all the mocap for a new water warfare game

904
00:46:26,780 --> 00:46:33,380
Pat's gonna do it what you're gonna kill Kevin Spacey. I never said that all right. Why did you say that?

905
00:46:33,380 --> 00:46:39,580
I never you there's no recording of it. You say right a recording of what me saying. I'm gonna kill Kevin Spacey

906
00:46:39,580 --> 00:46:42,500
We're gonna reverse it like a rap song so you're gonna leave

907
00:46:43,300 --> 00:46:47,540
Kevin Spacey. I never said that. You're gonna lick him. There was some time in

908
00:46:47,540 --> 00:46:55,940
between what I said. I'm gonna kill Kevin Spacey. That's fine right?

909
00:46:55,940 --> 00:47:00,100
No that's fine. Oh because you put the blank in it? It's like a long like you know

910
00:47:00,100 --> 00:47:04,860
it's like a period long breath. Well yeah I mean it's an incomplete sentence. Yeah it's because I'm

911
00:47:04,860 --> 00:47:08,060
telling Pat to do it in that second part because he already said he was going to.

912
00:47:08,060 --> 00:47:12,660
Exactly. Well I never said I was going to I said he said what did you

913
00:47:12,660 --> 00:47:18,060
I mean this is why you guys do the main podcast because I can't keep up.

914
00:47:18,060 --> 00:47:20,060
Pretty much who's on first.

915
00:47:20,060 --> 00:47:23,060
And then somebody else said something else and I said then I'm gonna do it.

916
00:47:23,060 --> 00:47:25,060
Another great 2008 joke, who's on first.

917
00:47:25,060 --> 00:47:27,060
Oh my god.

918
00:47:27,060 --> 00:47:29,060
Who's on first though?

919
00:47:29,060 --> 00:47:31,060
They should bring it back, I don't know.

920
00:47:31,060 --> 00:47:33,060
It would be who's on second.

921
00:47:33,060 --> 00:47:35,060
Who's on first?

922
00:47:35,060 --> 00:47:37,060
Ahmed the dead terrorist?

923
00:47:37,060 --> 00:47:39,060
That's right.

924
00:47:39,060 --> 00:47:41,060
That's who's on first.

925
00:47:41,060 --> 00:47:44,640
it was a very rare outlook on how do you know actually what

926
00:47:44,640 --> 00:47:46,920
patches has been bringing back very well

927
00:47:46,920 --> 00:47:51,720
is not as me play i have a very good he's been very very very very very

928
00:47:51,720 --> 00:47:56,320
incredible okay i've been i've been uh... we've been to the plague a lot of

929
00:47:56,320 --> 00:47:57,560
video games

930
00:47:57,560 --> 00:47:59,240
and uh...

931
00:47:59,240 --> 00:48:02,520
can see the name of the game or else we have to pay a visit to the royalties

932
00:48:02,520 --> 00:48:06,100
uh... i mean but it's been like between sport and split gate but like

933
00:48:06,100 --> 00:48:08,640
whenever we just start playing like if i like

934
00:48:08,640 --> 00:48:10,580
just do anything or if I like,

935
00:48:10,580 --> 00:48:12,880
like, "Oh, I almost killed him, I missed."

936
00:48:12,880 --> 00:48:13,720
Meep.

937
00:48:13,720 --> 00:48:15,480
(laughing)

938
00:48:15,480 --> 00:48:17,260
Just like, just saying meep again,

939
00:48:17,260 --> 00:48:18,660
I think it's really--

940
00:48:18,660 --> 00:48:19,620
- It's gonna come back.

941
00:48:19,620 --> 00:48:20,460
- I think it's gonna come back.

942
00:48:20,460 --> 00:48:21,280
- Yeah.

943
00:48:21,280 --> 00:48:22,120
- I think meep is--

944
00:48:22,120 --> 00:48:22,940
- It sucks. - I think you're tired

945
00:48:22,940 --> 00:48:23,780
of it. - One of the worst parts

946
00:48:23,780 --> 00:48:27,260
about speaking English is that if you say something

947
00:48:27,260 --> 00:48:29,620
like because you think it's funny to say it

948
00:48:29,620 --> 00:48:32,660
like four times, it becomes completely habitual.

949
00:48:32,660 --> 00:48:34,700
- Yeah. - Like I cannot,

950
00:48:34,700 --> 00:48:37,180
like I say no cap now.

951
00:48:37,180 --> 00:48:38,620
- Yeah. - To my wife.

952
00:48:38,620 --> 00:48:45,240
yeah yeah I did the dishes no cap you like year when we could not just stop

953
00:48:45,240 --> 00:48:52,160
saying that is awesome yeah yeah this is officially awesome that is awesome

954
00:48:52,160 --> 00:48:57,960
yeah we all still do that but this was like no we did it like like people told

955
00:48:57,960 --> 00:49:03,240
me like stop saying yeah like that one is also unique because that's not like

956
00:49:03,240 --> 00:49:05,240
once every 10 minutes.

957
00:49:05,240 --> 00:49:07,240
"Okay, this is officially awesome."

958
00:49:07,240 --> 00:49:10,240
"Yeah, okay, this is officially awesome."

959
00:49:10,240 --> 00:49:12,240
Which is like such a long tick.

960
00:49:12,240 --> 00:49:14,240
And people would get really mad at it.

961
00:49:14,240 --> 00:49:15,240
Yeah.

962
00:49:15,240 --> 00:49:17,240
Well, that was when you guys were in LA, right?

963
00:49:17,240 --> 00:49:19,240
No, that was when we were working.

964
00:49:19,240 --> 00:49:20,240
That was a long time.

965
00:49:20,240 --> 00:49:22,240
That was probably around the same time I met you.

966
00:49:22,240 --> 00:49:23,240
Okay, now this is awesome.

967
00:49:23,240 --> 00:49:28,240
I think we probably were just growing out of it by the time that we met you, maybe.

968
00:49:28,240 --> 00:49:30,240
I remember, and I probably said this before,

969
00:49:30,240 --> 00:49:33,980
we recorded a test episode of the podcast with me and Caleb and I sent it to Leo

970
00:49:33,980 --> 00:49:36,480
to be like hey do you think this is funny he was like you have to stop

971
00:49:36,480 --> 00:49:40,480
saying this is officially awesome. It's so annoying.

972
00:49:40,480 --> 00:49:44,480
You have to stop saying this is awesome.

973
00:49:44,480 --> 00:49:46,480
You have to stop saying this is awesome.

974
00:49:46,480 --> 00:49:48,480
I'm sorry the episode is...

975
00:49:48,480 --> 00:49:50,480
For some reason you said it's officially awesome every time.

976
00:49:50,480 --> 00:49:52,480
Meeep.

977
00:49:52,480 --> 00:49:54,480
Yeah I think saying meep is good.

978
00:49:54,480 --> 00:49:56,480
We were talking about it when we were gaming.

979
00:49:56,480 --> 00:49:58,480
Oh and also bringing back derp.

980
00:49:58,480 --> 00:50:00,980
I think Derp, I think Derp, we maybe have to wait a little bit.

981
00:50:00,980 --> 00:50:03,780
But I think Derp is, I think Derp is on its way up.

982
00:50:03,780 --> 00:50:04,780
I think Derp's on its way up.

983
00:50:04,780 --> 00:50:05,780
Derp's on the come up.

984
00:50:05,780 --> 00:50:06,780
I would buy it on Derp right now.

985
00:50:06,780 --> 00:50:07,780
I would buy it on Derp right now.

986
00:50:07,780 --> 00:50:08,780
Buy Derp now.

987
00:50:08,780 --> 00:50:09,780
Buy some shares in Ermagerd.

988
00:50:09,780 --> 00:50:10,780
Oh no, for sure.

989
00:50:10,780 --> 00:50:11,780
I think, I think Ermagerd might have a little bit longer to go.

990
00:50:11,780 --> 00:50:12,780
Yeah, I think, I think.

991
00:50:12,780 --> 00:50:13,780
I mean, well get in on the ground floor now.

992
00:50:13,780 --> 00:50:14,780
Get in the fucking.

993
00:50:14,780 --> 00:50:15,780
I think, I think Derp, like honestly, next month you can start saying Derp.

994
00:50:15,780 --> 00:50:16,780
I think I can.

995
00:50:16,780 --> 00:50:17,780
Yeah.

996
00:50:17,780 --> 00:50:18,780
I've been thinking about it.

997
00:50:18,780 --> 00:50:19,780
I think Ermagerd might have about two or three shares.

998
00:50:19,780 --> 00:50:23,940
on the ground floor now get in the fucking... I think derp like honestly next

999
00:50:23,940 --> 00:50:28,780
month you can start saying derp. I think I can. I think ermagerd might have about two or three years.

1000
00:50:28,780 --> 00:50:36,220
Ermagerd is very funny. Get in on it now. I'm laughing at ermagerd because we're talking about derp.

1001
00:50:36,220 --> 00:50:41,180
But I think if someone said ermagerd... What I really want to come back is like you know how

1002
00:50:41,180 --> 00:50:45,020
they they had all the different advice animals like they had like you know like socially awkward

1003
00:50:45,020 --> 00:50:49,100
Penguin. Bloodhound gang wrote a song about it. And like all the like you know the like

1004
00:50:49,100 --> 00:50:53,900
like the have the success kid one and the ones that are very clear when you look at it you're

1005
00:50:53,900 --> 00:50:58,940
like oh I can tell like this is like a happy kid so this is like this is a success thing like I can

1006
00:50:58,940 --> 00:51:03,820
tell the vibe. I really want the ones to come back where people just decided like oh yeah like this

1007
00:51:03,820 --> 00:51:09,020
bear means that it's a confession. Like this stuff like that then like you have to like know the

1008
00:51:09,020 --> 00:51:14,380
lexicon. Like I need it to get really complex and we need to bring all those. You know what I miss a

1009
00:51:14,380 --> 00:51:21,980
a lot is meme generator.com. I think it's still up. It definitely is still up. I would also,

1010
00:51:21,980 --> 00:51:25,680
that's another phase I went through is I would go on like. On the new images? No, I would

1011
00:51:25,680 --> 00:51:29,540
just, one of the meme generators has like a shuffle button. Or no, you know what it

1012
00:51:29,540 --> 00:51:35,500
is? You can type in like random numbers into the URL and you just get like memes that like

1013
00:51:35,500 --> 00:51:39,820
11 year old kids make to like make fun of their friends. It's the best thing ever. Yeah,

1014
00:51:39,820 --> 00:51:42,000
- Was it on Meme Generator?

1015
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:43,920
- Yeah, Meme Generator new images are like a different one.

1016
00:51:43,920 --> 00:51:45,140
- Image Flip is the one.

1017
00:51:45,140 --> 00:51:47,500
Image Flip is the one that you can get random images.

1018
00:51:47,500 --> 00:51:48,340
It's so good.

1019
00:51:48,340 --> 00:51:49,900
- But Meme Generator new images,

1020
00:51:49,900 --> 00:51:52,180
there's like a whole Tumblr dedicated to it.

1021
00:51:52,180 --> 00:51:53,820
And in high school I would look at that

1022
00:51:53,820 --> 00:51:55,900
and it would just be like, the funniest thing to me,

1023
00:51:55,900 --> 00:51:57,780
it would be like the picture of Fry

1024
00:51:57,780 --> 00:52:00,380
and it would say like, not sure if or whatever.

1025
00:52:00,380 --> 00:52:02,220
And it would just be like the big meme font

1026
00:52:02,220 --> 00:52:04,060
and all it would say was like, "Estoy."

1027
00:52:04,060 --> 00:52:04,900
(laughing)

1028
00:52:04,900 --> 00:52:05,740
That was it.

1029
00:52:05,740 --> 00:52:08,500
Just a picture of Fry from Futurama like,

1030
00:52:08,500 --> 00:52:09,340
- "Gay?"

1031
00:52:09,340 --> 00:52:18,340
Exactly. Yeah, that is also the best. They take Homer Simpson and they say something about, they say, "El baño está muerto."

1032
00:52:18,340 --> 00:52:24,340
That or like, I remember there was one, one specifically it's the "Ain't nobody got time for that lady."

1033
00:52:24,340 --> 00:52:28,340
Yeah. And it just says, "Car, car, car, car, car, car."

1034
00:52:28,340 --> 00:52:33,340
Yeah, we're just looking through Image Flip right now over here. What do you see on there?

1035
00:52:33,340 --> 00:52:34,340

A Minecraft meme. There's so much man. I remember when, when,

1065
00:55:03,120 --> 00:55:05,920
or you guess you're already looking at it, but I can't read that from here.

1066
00:55:05,920 --> 00:55:09,200
Have it here. I'll just read it out for everyone listening. Having fun,

1067
00:55:09,400 --> 00:55:12,480
forcing everyone to go to church with them, my grandparents.

1068
00:55:12,480 --> 00:55:17,680
You can guess where the car, which exit the car's getting off

1069
00:55:17,680 --> 00:55:17,960
at.

1070
00:55:17,960 --> 00:55:21,920
Yeah, I was gonna say when when the first time I ever played

1071
00:55:21,920 --> 00:55:27,520
mine, mine, minecraft, sorry, minecraft was with was with you

1072
00:55:27,520 --> 00:55:31,080
to Caleb and Cameron, because I just never played it. And then

1073
00:55:31,080 --> 00:55:34,520
and you guys were like, Oh, did you got to get minecraft? We got

1074
00:55:34,520 --> 00:55:37,520
to play it. It was like we were just starting the podcast and I

1075
00:55:37,520 --> 00:55:42,280
play with it was a lot of fun but like I also remember being like this is like

1076
00:55:42,280 --> 00:55:46,920
the exact generational divide yeah but I have with you guys which is like not

1077
00:55:46,920 --> 00:55:51,680
many years but enough where I'm like playing Minecraft and I'm like I feel a

1078
00:55:51,680 --> 00:55:55,640
thousand years old you know what it is that is my craft you literally I played

1079
00:55:55,640 --> 00:56:02,040
Minecraft like like in high school and now Minecraft does that to me yeah it is

1080
00:56:02,040 --> 00:56:06,080
it's they've changed it in the middle school that's what I mean yeah no high

1081
00:56:06,080 --> 00:56:09,560
It was like the only thing that would run on like my family computer right I play

1082
00:56:09,560 --> 00:56:14,560
Yeah, exactly. It's a game you can play on a Mac. You know, I know this was like when they first did the Java download

1083
00:56:14,560 --> 00:56:17,600
Oh, I would like join random servers. There's this one server

1084
00:56:17,600 --> 00:56:20,400
I would go on where the the mod would oh

1085
00:56:20,400 --> 00:56:21,320
he had a

1086
00:56:21,320 --> 00:56:27,560
He looked like the devil like he had like a devil skin and he would just type in chat like I'm the devil and he would

1087
00:56:27,560 --> 00:56:29,560
Go around just breaking

1088
00:56:29,560 --> 00:56:31,800
(laughing)

1089
00:56:31,800 --> 00:56:33,140
- Like, so there would be these kids would be,

1090
00:56:33,140 --> 00:56:34,460
"Please, no."

1091
00:56:34,460 --> 00:56:35,300
(laughing)

1092
00:56:35,300 --> 00:56:36,760
- They just joined a random server,

1093
00:56:36,760 --> 00:56:39,140
spent four hours building something sick,

1094
00:56:39,140 --> 00:56:41,900
and then the devil would fly down

1095
00:56:41,900 --> 00:56:46,640
and set everything on fire and say,

1096
00:56:46,640 --> 00:56:47,960
"LOL, I am the devil."

1097
00:56:47,960 --> 00:56:48,800
(laughing)

1098
00:56:48,800 --> 00:56:50,960
- I remember there was like a server

1099
00:56:50,960 --> 00:56:52,540
that was like a challenge server

1100
00:56:52,540 --> 00:56:54,720
where you're just like on a tiny floating island

1101
00:56:54,720 --> 00:56:55,940
and you have to like, like it was,

1102
00:56:55,940 --> 00:56:56,780
I forget what it's called,

1103
00:56:56,780 --> 00:56:58,340
but like you have to like harvest resources

1104
00:56:58,340 --> 00:57:01,940
just from like this like four by four square or whatever and me and my friend

1105
00:57:01,940 --> 00:57:06,060
went on that server and we got like this hack thing that like let us fly and we

1106
00:57:06,060 --> 00:57:10,180
found out that every island is just like they're all in a line and they're all

1107
00:57:10,180 --> 00:57:13,260
just a certain distance away so you can't see the next one so you just

1108
00:57:13,260 --> 00:57:16,460
logged on and just and just flew in a straight line and just took everything

1109
00:57:16,460 --> 00:57:21,100
out of everybody's chest all the way down the line and like you can't like

1110
00:57:21,100 --> 00:57:26,260
reset on that server so you just like ruined like 20 people's games.

1111
00:57:26,260 --> 00:57:31,660
I mean there's nothing more satisfying than ruining somebody's experience of a video game.

1112
00:57:31,660 --> 00:57:32,660
Oh absolutely.

1113
00:57:32,660 --> 00:57:33,660
Like a stranger.

1114
00:57:33,660 --> 00:57:34,660
Yeah.

1115
00:57:34,660 --> 00:57:38,660
Just cause like, it's zero stakes cause like who gives a fuck it's a video game.

1116
00:57:38,660 --> 00:57:41,860
You joined like a TF2 server, you just mic spammed, that shit was awesome.

1117
00:57:41,860 --> 00:57:45,660
Oh dude, hacking kids runescape accounts back in the day was so funny.

1118
00:57:45,660 --> 00:57:49,900
Yeah, I remember in middle school there was like a, or no no no, this was elementary school

1119
00:57:49,900 --> 00:57:50,900
in the third grade.

1120
00:57:50,900 --> 00:57:55,060
It was like me and this other girl had, we were the only two kids in our class who had

1121
00:57:55,060 --> 00:58:00,420
Neopets and she gave me her login I gave her mine and then I didn't know how to

1122
00:58:00,420 --> 00:58:06,140
play Neopets too well and you know I asked my sister like hey can you like you

1123
00:58:06,140 --> 00:58:11,100
know boost my profile or whatever also can you boost my friends and my

1124
00:58:11,100 --> 00:58:16,740
sister went on and just stole everything from this girl's Neopets account.

1125
00:58:16,740 --> 00:58:21,580
My sister was like... That's fucking vicious. That's a lot of time. That is a

1126
00:58:21,580 --> 00:58:25,460
that one of the most vicious things I've ever seen because one I was like what I

1127
00:58:25,460 --> 00:58:29,140
mean she's she's like four years older than me so she was in like mmm sixth

1128
00:58:29,140 --> 00:58:34,940
grade I was yeah third grade and she's like just stealing a bunch of shit from

1129
00:58:34,940 --> 00:58:38,580
an eight-year-old that's so so yeah and and I remember I came to school the next

1130
00:58:38,580 --> 00:58:41,580
day and she was like crying and I was like what's going on she's like I don't

1131
00:58:41,580 --> 00:58:44,900
want to fucking talk to you like you know it's like what happened she's like

1132
00:58:44,900 --> 00:58:49,660
you stole all my stuff and I had to explain to her like no my sister did that

1133
00:58:49,660 --> 00:58:52,700
She's like, well, why did you give your sister my password?

1134
00:58:52,700 --> 00:59:01,700
Yeah, I was always like I was - I was too nice as a kid I never yeah, that's the thing that fucking ruined me

1135
00:59:01,700 --> 00:59:03,820
I was just like I came home that day and I was like

1136
00:59:03,820 --> 00:59:09,160
Mad at her. I was like Amanda. Why the fuck did you like do that? That's so funny. She's like, I don't care

1137
00:59:09,160 --> 00:59:11,580
What do you say that? I don't care

1138
00:59:11,580 --> 00:59:17,100
I was also like a hundred percent though the kid who would watch kids do that shit and be like, I

1139
00:59:18,140 --> 00:59:20,540
I wouldn't do it, but I'd be like, "That's cool."

1140
00:59:20,540 --> 00:59:22,740
I was evil and I wanted to blow up the school, so...

1141
00:59:22,740 --> 00:59:23,440
Yeah.

1142
00:59:23,440 --> 00:59:25,440
Oh, dude, another fucking...

1143
00:59:25,440 --> 00:59:26,340
My cousin...

1144
00:59:26,340 --> 00:59:29,440
One of my cousins gave his, like, Webkinz account...

1145
00:59:29,440 --> 00:59:33,040
Like, password to, like, my neighbor.
