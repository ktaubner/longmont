00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,280
You're listening to Israel's number one podcast.

2
00:00:04,280 --> 00:00:06,280
Podcasts for the mindless.

3
00:00:06,280 --> 00:00:11,840
You're a crap monster.

4
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:15,600
Recording now.

5
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:17,600
Are you eating a pickle?

6
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:19,600
Patrick forgot how to get down there.

7
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:20,800
Oh, did you get one of those jaw trainers?

8
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:21,800
What do you mean?

9
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:23,800
Oh my god, he's using a fucking jaw...

10
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:25,800
Oh, that's gonna sound horrible.

11
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:27,800
It sounds really gross.

12
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:29,800
I'm trying to look smacks right now.

13
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:31,600
Caleb, those don't work.

14
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:34,480
I'm trying to max my looks out.

15
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:36,360
Those things don't work.

16
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:39,040
It's not going to make your jaw look wider.

17
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:40,040
Excuse me?

18
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:43,160
Sorry, are you seeing these gains on my face?

19
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:44,160
Hold on now.

20
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:45,160
Hold on.

21
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:46,160
Yeah, sorry.

22
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:47,520
Do you want to take back what you just said and stop slandering this company?

23
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:48,680
No, I'm not going to take back what I said.

24
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:50,200
It's because your teeth are going to fall out.

25
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:52,640
Your front and bottom, your top and bottom front teeth are going to fall out.

26
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:54,640
It's actually improved my life in every single way.

27
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:57,680
It fixed my oral fixation so I don't have to eat pussy all the time.

28
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:01,440
and then plus it fixes my TMJ too. I have less jaw pain.

29
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:05,000
Oh, does it really? You know what? If it does fix, I have TMJ pretty bad.

30
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,680
That's the reason I got it. But actually, I did it for the looks maxing.

31
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:08,680
Oh, wait.

32
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:09,680
Because we have...

33
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:11,680
Do you hear that?

34
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:14,720
Stop making nasty jaw sounds, dog.

35
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:16,360
That's my jaw clicks. I don't know why.

36
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:17,360
Stop making disgusting noises.

37
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:22,600
Guys, listen to this crazy noise that my jaw makes. That's what happens when I chew.

38
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:27,040
Yeah, but the noise comes out of my ass. I have to put the microphone really close to

39
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:30,160
ass but I'm just clicking my jaw now I have to look smacks cuz we got live

40
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:39,680
shows coming up. Imagine if you sit down to dinner at a restaurant and just start eating and every time you chew your food is just like...

41
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:46,480
People do it dude. People with rude manners. Eating a slice of toast at breakfast it just sounds like...

42
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:52,800
yeah just the driest thing in the world yeah yeah it's a cracker yeah yeah sir

43
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:54,800
Did you bring those cheez-its yourself?

44
00:01:54,800 --> 00:02:02,000
Where did you get those cheez-its? I don't shut up there dude. They're Gushers cheez-its. They have slime inside

45
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:07,200
Yeah, the new

46
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:11,400
Gushers X cheez-its drop

47
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:20,460
Rye's it's street wear drop. Can you imagine how the cheese stuff would be inside of the Gushers?

48
00:02:20,460 --> 00:02:26,780
cheese it. The cheese it is fruit flavored and the slime inside is cheese flavored. It

49
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:33,780
would just be a combo. They've already made Gucci's. Combo's suck dude. That's a bad snack.

50
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:44,260
Oh man, I can never eat pretzel combos again. Pizza combos. The pretzel pizza ones. Make

51
00:02:44,260 --> 00:02:49,180
up your mind here pizza popcorn popcorn popcorn pizza

52
00:02:49,180 --> 00:02:55,140
why can't you eat a bed pretzel I know they're like a they're like a dollar at

53
00:02:55,140 --> 00:03:02,820
like 7-eleven or whatever combo flavor for you bacon and eggs yeah scrambled

54
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:06,580
and eggs you know like a hard-boiled egg kind of has that combo middle

55
00:03:06,580 --> 00:03:10,580
consistency on the yolk. Exactly. You could put some bacon inside of it. You could put some Gushers eggs.

56
00:03:10,580 --> 00:03:15,580
Gushers eggs would be fucking genius dude. You crack it open and instead of a yolk it's like

57
00:03:15,580 --> 00:03:23,580
it's like fruit. Yeah but it is still a yolk. An egg full of raspberry jelly. That's actually a good idea.

58
00:03:23,580 --> 00:03:28,580
We're inventing British food as we speak right now. We're adding to the canon. This is crazy.

59
00:03:28,580 --> 00:03:32,580
Oh man. Well it can have a different flavor inside of it. What would that be called? Egg Gusher.

60
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:37,220
funky flopper yeah yeah that's probably probably the Queen buddy Queen's pieces

61
00:03:37,220 --> 00:03:44,740
buddy rumkin Queen Queen's pieces really good yeah smelly tincture yeah just eat

62
00:03:44,740 --> 00:03:52,940
all that dude sounds so bad their tins bit restrooms be light

63
00:03:54,820 --> 00:04:01,820
Worcestershire sauce. Worcestershire sauce. Worcestershire sauce. Worcestershire sauce.

64
00:04:01,820 --> 00:04:08,820
Worcestershire sauce. Worcestershire sauce. Worcestershire sauce. Worcestershire sauce.

65
00:04:08,820 --> 00:04:15,820
Worcestershire sauce. Worcestershire sauce. Worcestershire sauce. Worcestershire sauce.

66
00:04:15,820 --> 00:04:22,820
Worcestershire sauce. Worcestershire sauce. Worcestershire sauce. Worcestershire sauce.

67
00:04:22,820 --> 00:04:23,660
- But most people-- - Worcestershire.

68
00:04:23,660 --> 00:04:25,020
- Most people-- - Worcestershire, sure, sure.

69
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:28,140
- Most people have never learned that word.

70
00:04:28,140 --> 00:04:29,340
- So?

71
00:04:29,340 --> 00:04:30,420
- So I'm just saying.

72
00:04:30,420 --> 00:04:32,900
- Learn it once, it doesn't take you that many fucking times.

73
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:33,980
- If you weren't from New England,

74
00:04:33,980 --> 00:04:35,320
like you being who you are,

75
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:37,940
if I tried to explain to you that there was a silent C

76
00:04:37,940 --> 00:04:39,300
in the middle of that word,

77
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:42,060
you would be like, that's bullshit.

78
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:44,300
You would be one of the, absolutely,

79
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:45,240
if you were from California,

80
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:47,060
you'd be one of those people who can't pronounce it.

81
00:04:47,060 --> 00:04:47,980
- No, that's not true.

82
00:04:47,980 --> 00:04:49,180
- Unquestionably, dude.

83
00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:51,540
- No, I watched too much Monty Python as a child.

84
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:53,580
- That might be a problem, yeah.

85
00:04:53,580 --> 00:04:55,460
Okay, but also in this reality,

86
00:04:55,460 --> 00:04:56,300
you've never watched anything,

87
00:04:56,300 --> 00:04:58,100
you've never said a word before.

88
00:04:58,100 --> 00:05:01,880
- Okay, so I'm learning English from the ground up.

89
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:04,340
- And you can't read and you have no mouth.

90
00:05:04,340 --> 00:05:05,180
- Yeah.

91
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:07,860
- You're learning English from the ground up

92
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:09,580

- Okay.

94
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:12,460
- You're underground, in a hole, you're dead.

95
00:05:12,460 --> 00:05:16,360
- And every time I learn a new word, I rise up.

96
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:19,540
- No, that's how you should have to learn English.

97
00:05:19,540 --> 00:05:20,380
- Yeah.

98
00:05:20,380 --> 00:05:24,500
buried in every word that you learn you get to go up one inch right until you

00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:28,460

I'm hoping to. I'm like I'm so nervous about like

126
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:04,020
pandemics like what if somebody gets COVID from our live show?

127
00:08:04,020 --> 00:08:05,620
Then that'd be f*cking epic.

128
00:08:05,620 --> 00:08:07,620
That would be, that would stay with me for the rest of my life.

129
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:10,240
By the way, Pat, you are a terrible salesman.

130
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:12,740
We're supposed to be pushing tickets to this show

131
00:08:12,740 --> 00:08:14,740
and you're like,

132
00:08:14,740 --> 00:08:20,240
you're like, "Oh, I hope nobody gets COVID at this show, you f*cking retard."

133
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:22,240
What are you doing, dude?

192
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:33,000

00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:21,200
with it so you might want to watch out.

217
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:22,040
- Come on.

218
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:22,960
- That's right.

219
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:25,760
I'm gonna hire a bushman to shoot you.

220
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:28,600
- I'm gonna keep feeding you.

221
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:30,240
- I'm gonna have a vaccine going once,

222
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:31,840
vaccine going twice, vaccine going twice.

223
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:33,840
- I'm gonna hire a bushman to sit in the back

224
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:36,600
of the audience and shoot you with a dart full of HIV

225
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:39,360
out of a bamboo stick.

226
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:40,200
- Yeah, that's so sick.

227
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:41,640
- And you're gonna go, "Ah!"

228
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:43,880
And die instantly.

229
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:48,480
- I'm gonna drink a bunch of HIV

230
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:49,640
and then I'm gonna sit on a hot plate

231
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:51,800
and diffuse it into the room so you breathe it in.

232
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:53,160
- Oh, that's a pretty good idea.

233
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:54,760
- You won't even be able to detect it.

234
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:56,600
- Yeah, that's a really, really good idea.

235
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:58,560
- And then I'll fuck you too, just in case.

236
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:00,120
- See, that's why I have it,

237
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:01,520
and that's why I fucking jack off

238
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:03,760
before I start doing standup,

239
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:05,520
'cause walking around with a loaded gun.

240
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:07,640
- You're doing too much of this HIV stuff.

241
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:09,240
- Why?

242
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:10,760
- It's a serious disease.

243
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:11,600
- Tell me what's--

244
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:12,560
- Yeah, and you're gonna die from it.

245
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:16,360
- Yeah, it's gonna be fucking serious when you have it, bud.

246
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:22,800
not enough chicken soup in the world for that. What do you mean? I mean you're gonna be sick.

247
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:28,760
Yeah. You're sick sick. You're gonna be lying in bed with a hot compress on your head. Yep.

248
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:32,600
And a mercury thermometer in your mouth. Yep. And you're gonna say, "Mom, I can't go to

249
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:37,200
school today." Yeah, she's gonna say, "Why?" And you're gonna have to explain to her. I'll

250
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:40,760
never go to school again, bitch. Don't talk like that. Yeah. Don't talk to me like that.

251
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:44,960
What's up? What's up? Don't "What's up" me. What's up? Don't say "What's up, bitch." What's

252
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:45,960
What's up you?

253
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:46,960
What's up bitch?

254
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:48,780
I'm fucking down the street from you dude, I'll crack your shit.

255
00:15:48,780 --> 00:15:51,200
Come over right now, we'll fight.

256
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:52,440
That might be pretty good actually.

257
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:54,680
What, you're gonna leave and then come fight me?

258
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:57,120
Yeah, that might be the best episode ever.

259
00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:00,320
We just cut and then it's just, I mean it's not gonna take long, I might beat his ass

260
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:01,320
up.

261
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:03,440
No, I have stuff to do tonight, I don't want to sit here and wait for you to walk over.

262
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:05,560
I have stuff to do, I gotta beat Pat's ass.

263
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:09,080
You can walk over there if you stay on your phone the whole time and we don't have any

264
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:11,760
down time, but I refuse to let you do that.

265
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:14,640
Pat, how about we just play in a fight and we'll record it then.

266
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:15,480
- Okay.

267
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:16,440
- Alright, sound good?

268
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:17,260
- Me, you.

269
00:16:17,260 --> 00:16:18,600
- You guys better not fight without me there.

270
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:19,920
- How about at the show?

271
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:21,100
- Okay, that's a good--

272
00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:21,940
- How's that sound?

273
00:16:21,940 --> 00:16:23,280
- We were trying to brainstorm what to do.

274
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:24,120
- Yeah.

275
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:26,560
- What if I just beat the shit out of Pat?

276
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:27,820
- No, you've done that before.

277
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:29,080
- I'm gonna put you in the ambulance.

278
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:31,160
- Oh yeah, when I fight clubbed you.

279
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:32,000
- Yeah.

280
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,080
- Yeah, when we went and visited Pat,

281
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:35,600
just every time that we walked outside,

282
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:38,320
I would say fight club and punch him really hard.

283
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:39,480
- Yeah.

284
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:40,480
- Yeah, and he didn't like it.

285
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:42,760
And then me and Cam teamed up on him,

286
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:43,600
and he wouldn't let us in to the apartment.

287
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:44,600
I was so scared.

288
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:47,600
Yeah, you fucking fight clubbed me.

289
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:49,600
Yeah, you fucking got your ass kicked.

290
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:50,600
Fight club's cool, dude.

291
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:52,600
Yeah, dude, it's called respecting your brothers.

292
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:53,600
Yeah, it's called Project Mayhem.

293
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:55,600
I already got blood in, blood outed.

294
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:59,600
No, I'm gonna put some blood in you and you're not gonna like the kind of blood that's going in.

295
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:01,600
Come on, just don't bring this back up.

296
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:04,600
It's Spider-Man's blood and you're gonna turn into Venom.

297
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:08,600
Oh yeah, not so fucking, oh, don't talk about this now, huh?

298
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:10,600
I bet you're fucking excited.

299
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:12,600
Can we not talk about the Venom Symbiote?

300
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:13,600
Please?

301
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:14,600
Yeah.

302
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:16,100
I know somebody who got it.

303
00:17:16,100 --> 00:17:17,100
Who?

304
00:17:17,100 --> 00:17:20,000
Who do you know that got the Venom Symbiote?

305
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,000
Magic Johnson.

306
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,000
Alright.

307
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,000
No.

308
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,000
No, Patrick.

309
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,120
No, he got the fungus, dude.

310
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:28,120
That's different.

311
00:17:28,120 --> 00:17:29,120
Yeah.

312
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:30,120
Yeah.

313
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:31,600
He got the fucking fungus.

314
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:35,120
Yeah, Patrick just saw a black guy and he was like, "He must have the Venom Symbiote."

315
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:36,120
No!

316
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:37,120
No!

317
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:38,120
No!

318
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:39,120
You, you're a fucking idiot.

319
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:46,120
You're racist, you have AIDS, and you suck at selling live shows.

320
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:48,120
Fuck you, Pat.

321
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:50,120
And I'm gonna beat your ass.

322
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:52,120
You ruined my life before this show.

323
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:53,120
Three weeks.

324
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:54,120
Oh no.

325
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:55,120
Fuck you.

00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:56,120
That's right.

327
00:17:56,120 --> 00:18:00,120
Come on, man.

328
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:02,120
That did not happen.

329
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:04,120
People are gonna keep saying that at me.

330
00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:07,120
If anything, I'm the bad one in this situation because I said it.

331
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:10,920
guys can attack me and leave poor Patrick alone. He's an angel. That's right, Pat's

332
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:16,720
such an angel. Yeah, he's totally never done anything so evil. Because I'm not fragile and I will not cry if you say

333
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:22,240
mean things to me. I won't cry, I just get upset. I won't either, definitely won't cry, I won't. He just

00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:27,280
turns red. Mm-hmm. You know, starts spinning really fast. Yeah. Dude, he got the carnage

335
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:33,160

343
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:07,720
such a heavy sleeper that you could just completely pick him up and attach him to

344
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:11,200
the wall and he wouldn't wake up so we might win my mom would like come upstairs

eat me and my older brother's food whoa that's diabolical yeah like is that

348
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:30,440
also that's an uncomfortable amount of food for an eight-year-old eat right like

349
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:33,960
He was fucking scarfing it down just to throw it at our faces.

350
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:37,520
It's nice that you just had food waiting for you when you were younger.

351
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:39,320
Yeah, well it was made by my slave.

352
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:40,320
Oh, okay.

353
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:41,320
Yeah.

354
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:44,240
Yeah, I used to have to just make my own cereal or whatever.

355
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:47,960
Yeah, I used to have to dig up nuts and berries from the forest to have them make cereal.

356
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:49,760
I used to have to forage every morning.

357
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:50,760
Yeah.

358
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:51,760
It was annoying.

359
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:52,760
Yeah, yeah.

360
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:53,760
So, recognize your privilege, Caleb.

361
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:56,360
My dad used to have to hunt my neighbor's dog to get some meat.

362
00:19:56,360 --> 00:20:00,280
We'd have to wait fucking months for them to get a new one every time to eat dinner.

363
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:02,000
Oh man, it was the worst.

364
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,040
You ever had boiled dog?

365
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:05,520
It's not that good.

366
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:06,520
Yeah.

367
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:07,520
It's not that good.

368
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:10,720
And it's like, we spent all this money on a Gatling gun and the dog dies after like

369
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:11,720
two bullets.

370
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:12,720
Not even fucking worth it.

371
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:13,720
What a waste.

372
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:14,720
Yeah.

373
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:18,040
And going over to the neighbor's house, "So, you thinking about getting a new dog?"

374
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:19,880
Since the other one ran away mysteriously.

375
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:23,680
You know, I feel like if you got five dogs, it might keep you even better.

376
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:30,360
It's like a breeding thing, you know, and then you could sell off the dogs. It's a Gatling gun with like a silencer on each barrel

377
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:37,680
Like yeah, I don't know we had an electric fence and everything I don't know how he got out. Oh

378
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:48,180
Man my tooth is hurting. Oh, oh shit. I can't I should recommend something real quick. I was supposed to go to the dentist yesterday

00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:14,840
They're not an upgrade. They're upgrading my body. I'm being coming a cyborg the micro plastic attachment

395
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:20,600

396
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:26,760
The first step to becoming a cyborg. They're giving me infertility. Yeah.

397
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:31,840
Yeah my sperms are pixelated now they can't do shit when they get in there.

398
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:32,560
Damn.

399
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:34,360
Alright. This list is

00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:39,640
top ten zoo animals. They just, they turn, when they go into a woman they turn red and they fly out like Mario

401
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:41,040

405
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:53,720
is the top comment

406
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:57,360
never doubt the penguin penguins deserve the number one spot and are not just the

407
00:22:57,360 --> 00:23:00,440
best animal in the zoo but the best animal in the world it's about time

408
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:03,800
penguins get the respect they deserve they're the only reason i ever go to

409
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:07,760
zoos penguins are the cutest most interesting animal ever vote penguin

410
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:09,580
disease best animal ever

411
00:23:09,580 --> 00:23:13,640
i mean i i can't really argue with that i the only time you're ever going to see a

412
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:21,920
penguin is at a zoo. Not if you live in Far Astica. Unless you live in Antarctica or something

413
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:27,600
or fucking North Dakota. Do you think penguins are truly as crass as that movie portrayed?

414
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:33,040
Yeah. You think so? Yeah. Are you kidding? I'm gonna sit on this egg because I'm gay.

415
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:38,120
Yeah. Yeah I remember that. What an amazing film. Yeah Bob Saget directed that I learned.

416
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:42,420
I never knew that. You learned that in school. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah, it was on the quiz.

417
00:23:42,420 --> 00:23:47,960
It's like, you have to recite the first like five lines of the Declaration of

418
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:52,040
Independence and who directed Farce of the Penguins? Yeah, it was a math problem

419
00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:57,960
where X was Bob Saget and it was like solve for director of Farce of the Penguins.

420
00:23:57,960 --> 00:24:02,680
Here's a comment from this from Penguins. One time a penguin got out of its

421
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:07,080
enclosure at the zoo and I was terrified lol

422
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:12,120
we should you know what seeing a penguin in like in your face like a penguin I'm

423
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:16,360
I mean it's already documented depends what height you are I don't birds that's

424
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:21,080
true you have a fear of birds not like I don't know I don't like a penguin I mean

425
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:24,340
you can't even fucking free and fly feel like I feel like if I looked at a

426
00:24:24,340 --> 00:24:28,160
penguin for long enough I would start getting freaked out by it you ever see a

427
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:33,500
Swan in real life you ever get close. I'm not like it's not like a debilitating fear

428
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:39,260
It's not like I mean the truth is that pretty much every animal looks fucking creepy if you look at it for long enough

429
00:24:39,260 --> 00:24:44,240
Yeah, yeah animals are meant to be seen in photos. Yeah. Yeah, and I got your door if I do it

430
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:49,080
If I ever saw a condor in person, I would run away. Well condors are not very big. Are you?

431
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:53,320
They're very small

432
00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:56,040
Condors are huge!

433
00:24:56,040 --> 00:24:58,040
Are you thinking of a bacteria maybe?

434
00:24:58,040 --> 00:25:01,040
Yeah, sorry, I'm thinking of a mycelium.

435
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:05,040
Mycelium?

436
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:07,040
Me. Hello, I'm cilium.

437
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:09,040
Hey! It's me, cilium!

438
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:12,040
No, condors aren't that big. I think they have a big wingspan.

439
00:25:12,040 --> 00:25:14,040
But they're not like, big.

440
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:16,040
What? Okay, okay.

441
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:19,040
Let's see condor weight. If it weighs under 30 pounds, I win.

442
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:21,040
Of course they don't weigh much. It's a bird.

443
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:22,040
I'm not arguing.

444
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:23,040
Condor with big wings.

445
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:24,040
You said they were small.

446
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:25,040
You didn't say they were light.

447
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:26,040
They're small.

448
00:25:26,040 --> 00:25:27,040
Anything that's 20 pounds is small.

449
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:28,040
Not true.

450
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:29,040
So you're small?

451
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:30,040
You admit it?

452
00:25:30,040 --> 00:25:31,040
I'm not 20 pounds.

453
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:32,040
Okay, so you're 300 pounds?

454
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:33,040
I'm 174 pounds.

455
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:34,040
You're either 300 or 20.

456
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:35,040
Pick right now.

457
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:36,040
300, easy.

458
00:25:36,040 --> 00:25:37,040
Best, easiest decision of my life.

459
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:38,040
You're this big.

460
00:25:38,040 --> 00:25:39,040
You have the density of a neutron star.

461
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:40,040
Nope.

462
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:41,040
Yep.

463
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:42,040
Yeah, so what?

464
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:43,040
I'm not sure.

465
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:44,040
I'm not sure.

466
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:45,040
I'm not sure.

467
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:46,040
I'm not sure.

468
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:47,040
I'm not sure.

469
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:48,040
I'm not sure.

470
00:25:48,040 --> 00:25:49,040
I'm not sure.

471
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:50,040
I'm not sure.

472
00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:52,040
Yeah, so what? I'll fucking pull you up.

473
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:53,040
Okay, Caleb.

474
00:25:53,040 --> 00:25:56,040
I'm doing a research and I'm excited to see Penguin our number one.

475
00:25:56,040 --> 00:26:01,040
Condor running towards you, like full, full arms out.

476
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:02,040
You're not afraid of that.

477
00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:04,040
Nah, dude. I do the unstoppable force.

478
00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:07,040
That's true.

479
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:09,040
The only thing that can stop a condor is an unstoppable force.

480
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:11,040
I just hit him with the unstoppable force.

481
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:13,040
Fucking start scissoring my legs and fists.

482
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:14,040
Palm in the air.

483
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:15,040
Like this.

484
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:16,040
Oh, oh.

485
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:19,040
Yeah, that's how you defeat any sort of wild animal.

486
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:23,620
animal yeah it's true yeah it's true it's true I could fucking I could hit a

487
00:26:23,620 --> 00:26:27,780
pain you know what I okay I'll get freaked out by a penguin but if it like

488
00:26:27,780 --> 00:26:31,900
charged at me I would kick it yeah I mean that I would kick anything that

489
00:26:31,900 --> 00:26:37,060
charged at my charge and fucking waddles and slides okay slides

490
00:26:37,060 --> 00:26:41,020
penguin of doom just jump over oh the pain all right well that's kind of

491
00:26:41,020 --> 00:26:45,940
different I'm charging at you it's so easy to defeat a penguin due to the fact

492
00:26:45,940 --> 00:26:52,020
that they are they are earthbound right and I humans have invented flight so I

493
00:26:52,020 --> 00:26:56,980
would simply I would simply maybe hot air balloon and glide away on a hand glider

494
00:26:56,980 --> 00:27:04,460
and jump over so easy you're setting up a hang glider cuz a penguin is just

495
00:27:04,460 --> 00:27:09,300
walking towards you just when you are you charging I don't you don't get to

496
00:27:09,300 --> 00:27:12,540
switch now be like oh you want to get out of the way okay but yeah about a

497
00:27:12,540 --> 00:27:15,260
Penguins charge, right? Think about how slow it would be.

498
00:27:15,260 --> 00:27:17,340
I would joust the fuck out of a penguin.

499
00:27:17,340 --> 00:27:17,660
Yeah?

500
00:27:17,660 --> 00:27:18,060
I'd fucking...

501
00:27:18,060 --> 00:27:18,860
With what?

502
00:27:18,860 --> 00:27:20,540
With a jousting stick.

503
00:27:20,540 --> 00:27:20,940
With another penguin.

504
00:27:20,940 --> 00:27:22,300
What are you talking about? Yeah, with a...

505
00:27:22,300 --> 00:27:24,460
I just wanted to see what you said.

506
00:27:24,460 --> 00:27:26,780
Jousting stick. What's that called?

507
00:27:26,780 --> 00:27:27,660
A lance.

508
00:27:27,660 --> 00:27:32,060
A lance. Fucking lance him, dude. Easy. Penguin kebab for dinner. Easy.

509
00:27:32,060 --> 00:27:36,060
Penguins are pretty cute, especially the jackass penguin. Would you eat a penguin?

510
00:27:36,060 --> 00:27:37,820
I would eat anything.

511
00:27:37,820 --> 00:27:40,860
I've heard that penguins are bad to eat.

512
00:27:40,860 --> 00:27:42,140
Of course they're bad to eat, dude.

513
00:27:42,140 --> 00:27:44,860
The only thing you need is like chicken and beef.

514
00:27:44,860 --> 00:27:48,220
Well yeah, but you would think a penguin, it's a bird, you think it would taste like poultry.

515
00:27:48,220 --> 00:27:52,700
Why? No, dude, it can't fly and it's got like seal skin.

516
00:27:52,700 --> 00:27:54,700
I wouldn't think it tastes, I mean...

517
00:27:54,700 --> 00:28:00,140
I personally think pengies are boring. They make these screeching noises.

518
00:28:00,140 --> 00:28:02,700
Just throwing in some penguin comments.

519
00:28:02,700 --> 00:28:04,700
I love penguins.

520
00:28:04,700 --> 00:28:08,460
Me and my friends said that when we grow up, we're gonna have a fairy penguin farm.

521
00:28:08,460 --> 00:28:17,220
my favorite bird and they're so fat and cool the movie happy feet has come to

522
00:28:17,220 --> 00:28:26,980
life that's like my mom didn't think a narwhal was a real animal for me yeah I

523
00:28:26,980 --> 00:28:29,980
didn't think it was either yeah I had to I had to convince her one time and it

524
00:28:29,980 --> 00:28:33,780
was the same car ride I owned my mom twice in one car ride where we we were

525
00:28:33,780 --> 00:28:38,300
talking about like we drove by like Gettysburg and she was like Abraham

526
00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:43,100
Lincoln it was not real no my mom was like it's like me and my brother just

00:28:43,100 --> 00:28:46,140
like laughing and like the names all the headstones and shit she was like well

528
00:28:46,140 --> 00:28:55,980
you have some respect millions of people died here I was like I looked it up it

529
00:28:55,980 --> 00:29:03,420
was like 15,000 fucking guys million if you'd like just for inflation yeah that

530
00:29:03,420 --> 00:29:04,260
- That's a really good point.

531
00:29:04,260 --> 00:29:07,100
- That's true, guys were worth a lot more back then.

532
00:29:07,100 --> 00:29:08,420
- They were worth way more, yeah,

533
00:29:08,420 --> 00:29:10,100
'cause you didn't have China and India

534
00:29:10,100 --> 00:29:12,620
kinda inflating the numbers on guys.

535
00:29:12,620 --> 00:29:16,520
So it was just, 15,000 was a ton of people back then.

536
00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:18,660

567
00:31:32,420 --> 00:31:37,900
You think the devil is funny? Those are not equivalent. Those are not equi- a goat in a mass

568
00:31:37,900 --> 00:31:42,300
shooting? You think a pedophile is funny to you? So you think a mass shooting is funnier than a goat? Okay, so let me get this straight.

569
00:31:42,300 --> 00:31:48,740
No, I don't think- You think mass shootings, tsunamis, warlocks, all this is funnier to you than a

570
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:54,460
goat I mean yeah evil stuff you know warlocks wizards so you think like you

00:32:12,620 --> 00:32:13,460
Patrick, Patrick, Patrick.

575
00:32:13,460 --> 00:32:14,300
- False equivalency.

576
00:32:14,300 --> 00:32:16,360
- To you, a sorcerer is a clown?

577
00:32:16,360 --> 00:32:17,200
- Yeah, let me see, let me see.

578
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:18,500
- It depends on the sorcerer.

579
00:32:18,500 --> 00:32:19,980
- Okay, climate change, climate change.

580
00:32:19,980 --> 00:32:21,520
What's this, a Will Ferrell movie to you?

581
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:22,620
What's this, Anchorman 3?

582
00:32:22,620 --> 00:32:24,300
- Okay, wait, hold on, hold on now.

583
00:32:24,300 --> 00:32:25,420
- Are you fucking kidding me?

584
00:32:25,420 --> 00:32:26,780
- Imagine if it's-- - Will Ferrell--

585
00:32:26,780 --> 00:32:28,100
- An inconvenient truth?

586
00:32:28,100 --> 00:32:30,280
- That might be a pretty funny climate change movie.

587
00:32:30,280 --> 00:32:31,420
- Maybe it'll make you laugh,

588
00:32:31,420 --> 00:32:33,060
but it'll also make you think.

589
00:32:33,060 --> 00:32:34,420
- That would be a pretty good idea.

590
00:32:34,420 --> 00:32:35,740
We could maybe change some minds.

591
00:32:35,740 --> 00:32:37,780
- Oh my God, wait, hold on, okay, okay, okay.

592
00:32:37,780 --> 00:32:40,160
Cameron, pull up the climate change facts.

00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:57,220
that is actually okay i'll play the heel

600
00:32:57,220 --> 00:33:03,260

603
00:33:10,500 --> 00:33:12,680
- Okay.

604
00:33:12,680 --> 00:33:13,520
- Oh, fuck.

605
00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:14,960
- All right, let's talk about goats.

606
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:15,800
- Goat tacos are awesome.

607
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:16,640
- All the comments--

608
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:17,860
- I wouldn't eat a goat taco.

609
00:33:17,860 --> 00:33:19,180
- All the comments are just like,

610
00:33:19,180 --> 00:33:21,080
the goats are the best. - I might eat a goat.

611
00:33:21,080 --> 00:33:22,180
- They are hilarious.

612
00:33:22,180 --> 00:33:24,040
Goats love penguins.

613
00:33:24,040 --> 00:33:25,020
- Is that true?

614
00:33:25,020 --> 00:33:26,380
- Have you ever eaten goat?

615
00:33:26,380 --> 00:33:27,340
- Yeah, goat's good.

616
00:33:27,340 --> 00:33:28,980
I used to have goat a lot as a kid.

617
00:33:28,980 --> 00:33:29,820
- What?

618
00:33:29,820 --> 00:33:31,460
- Oh yeah, there's like goat curry and like--

619
00:33:31,460 --> 00:33:32,900
- I had goat stew. - Oh yeah, I guess there is.

620
00:33:32,900 --> 00:33:36,060
- Goat stew, very common meal in my house growing up.

621
00:33:36,060 --> 00:33:37,020
- I should go get some goat curry.

622
00:33:37,020 --> 00:33:40,780
I guess it's not different from lamb. My mom made this goat stew with peanut butter.

623
00:33:40,780 --> 00:33:46,500
Oooh. So good, dude. That sounds, yeah, it's just, she just took like a goat leg and put

624
00:33:46,500 --> 00:33:52,420
peanut butter on it. And Cameron was like, "Mmm!" I love this! I haven't had goat in a

625
00:33:52,420 --> 00:33:57,580
really long time, but it's good. Yeah. I like the normal meats that have been extruded from

626
00:33:57,580 --> 00:34:02,020
something. Lamb is, I think, lamb's really good. Lamb is really good, too. But lamb I

627
00:34:02,020 --> 00:34:05,420
only, I like in like a gyro. I'm not too crazy about shrimp lamb. I like lamb because of

628
00:34:05,420 --> 00:34:09,860
how evil it is to eat it. It is pretty, yeah it's like lamb. Oh it's the most evil thing to eat.

629
00:34:09,860 --> 00:34:16,580
What if we killed the babies too? Yeah. Might as well. Let's kill the babies too. They probably taste even better.

630
00:34:16,580 --> 00:34:23,300
It's like, do you, I remember like the first time I heard what veal was. Yeah. Jesus Christ dude. Veal is the most evil thing to eat.

631
00:34:23,300 --> 00:34:28,980
It's like yeah basically we do Chinese water torture to a baby cow until it gets

632
00:34:28,980 --> 00:34:34,420
so sad that it dies of depression. Yeah. And that's what you eat in your pasta sauce.

633
00:34:34,420 --> 00:34:42,420
that's like foie gras right yeah we basically take a duck and we just kill

634
00:34:42,420 --> 00:34:48,540
all its family yeah duck full of we pump this duck full of shit yeah air and we

635
00:34:48,540 --> 00:34:52,420
let it float away we do the human centipede down duck and then when it's

636
00:34:52,420 --> 00:34:58,140
dead it's we take its liver out and feed it raw yeah yeah we're basically the most

637
00:34:58,140 --> 00:35:02,660
evil people all time oh man you ever if you think about meat for long enough you

638
00:35:02,660 --> 00:35:06,400
just realize I remember one time I went to a Brazilian steakhouse with my

639
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:10,940
grandfather and he ordered chicken hearts and it's just like just seeing a

640
00:35:10,940 --> 00:35:15,860
bowl full of chicken hearts is like yeah I'm dude come on chicken hearts chicken

641
00:35:15,860 --> 00:35:22,220
gizzards all that shit is so good yeah it's really good it's like it's

642
00:35:22,220 --> 00:35:27,080
literally like just like it's like a sorcerer collecting souls and a crystal

643
00:35:27,080 --> 00:35:32,960
good a bowl with like a lot of lives of a hundred chickens yeah yeah that's the

644
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:35,880
other thing we need something like chicken hearts you realize like oh I've

really cool yeah it's intriguing

675
00:38:15,620 --> 00:38:25,620
yeah it's like a sea brooch once I saw a giraffe that was sniffing another

676
00:38:25,620 --> 00:38:34,780
giraffes but so funny how'd that get his whole other ones but you wanted to do

677

think drafts do you think they like do you think they get freaked out when I see

678
00:38:39,940 --> 00:38:44,800
like other animals yeah like I would I feel like I probably have the same

679
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:48,580
feeling that I have when I imagine a monkey just reminded me speaking of that

680
00:38:48,580 --> 00:38:52,460
like a monkey I I don't know if you guys saw Godzilla versus Kong yet yeah I saw

681

682
00:38:56,060 --> 00:38:59,560
with this little deaf girl who uses like sign language to like communicate with

683
00:38:59,560 --> 00:39:02,420
him and like there's a whole sequence where she's like telling him where to go

684
00:39:02,420 --> 00:39:06,500
and she's like oh you have to go into this like tunnel to go inside the earth

685
00:39:06,500 --> 00:39:11,580
because your your family like might be living down there and I was watching

686
00:39:11,580 --> 00:39:15,220
with my dad and he's like this is the craziest thing ever to put in a movie

687
00:39:15,220 --> 00:39:19,100
because that's like if an aunt started telling you that your family was in a

giant hole it was like yeah man you should go down there I think you're I

00:40:19,900 --> 00:40:22,020
to prove they're down there, but they might be down there.

710
00:40:22,020 --> 00:40:23,220
Yeah, they love it.

711
00:40:23,220 --> 00:40:38,420

717
00:41:03,300 --> 00:41:06,920
you imagine how much that the coca-cola would tenderize the polar bear meat no

718
00:41:06,920 --> 00:41:10,580
but here's it I was a Google Foods experiment he's wanted alive the coke

721
00:41:17,860 --> 00:41:21,780
You can kill his cousin who drinks Pepsi. Yeah, that's fine. But the Coca-Cola polar bear,

722
00:41:21,780 --> 00:41:25,220
I mean, I'm gonna take him home and I'm gonna put him in an aquarium in my house.

723
00:41:25,220 --> 00:41:29,300
Yeah, well, okay, I've got a night, okay, Pepsi, if you're listening to this, so you got the Coca-Cola

724
00:41:29,300 --> 00:41:34,580
polar bear, right, so they come this winter. The Pepsi penguin.

725
00:41:34,580 --> 00:41:38,660
Pepsi penguin, it doesn't make sense, how's he gonna hold the fucking glass of Pepsi?

726
00:41:38,660 --> 00:41:41,220
Like an egg. Like an egg, yeah.

727
00:41:41,220 --> 00:41:42,580
On his feet. He's gonna sit on it?

728
00:41:42,580 --> 00:41:46,500
No, they put them on the top of their feet. And then they drink it?

729
00:41:46,500 --> 00:41:51,300
against their stomach. He can have a straw? What are you guys even talking about?

730
00:41:51,300 --> 00:41:54,420
The Pepsi Penguin. The Pepsi Penguin. It doesn't make any sense, dude.

731
00:41:54,420 --> 00:41:57,700
Fuck you. It makes sense. A penguin isn't smart enough like a polar bear.

732
00:41:57,700 --> 00:42:04,820
You just hate when something rocks your world. You're right. I'm sorry. My initial reaction

733
00:42:04,820 --> 00:42:09,780
because something rocked my world was to fight it, but you're right. The Pepsi Penguin is a perfect

734
00:42:09,780 --> 00:42:16,420
idea. Make 21 comments. I love bears and I love white furred animals, so polar bears have

735
00:42:16,420 --> 00:42:19,620
always been a great zoo attraction for me. You love white bears? It's nice, it's

736
00:42:19,620 --> 00:42:26,380
perfect. Yeah. What's up? You're gonna love me. Here's a comment from Trigger Trash Kid,

737
00:42:26,380 --> 00:42:30,900
"They are white and cute, no racism."

738
00:42:30,900 --> 00:42:39,740
I love him dude. Trigger Trash Kid is just, I mean one of the all-timers. We should get him on the

739
00:42:39,740 --> 00:42:46,260
live show. He should be our guest. Absolutely. Number five, lion. Yeah. I

740
00:42:46,260 --> 00:42:53,540
would need a lion. Why not? We've done this before. We've talked about eating animals we

741
00:42:53,540 --> 00:43:00,380
would eat, right? A lion, yeah, a lion, I don't know. Too gamey. I would need a cat, I

742
00:43:00,380 --> 00:43:04,980
guess. A cat doesn't sound very delicious to me. It doesn't matter if it's

743
00:43:04,980 --> 00:43:09,940
delicious or not yeah you know what it's just about yeah it's about if you put if

744
00:43:09,940 --> 00:43:12,720
you put it in front of me I would eat it you could put you could like be like

745
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:17,280
here's lion meat it tastes absolutely Cameron gusting I would eat it I have a

746
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:23,700
plate of poop right here for you that's not meat it's dog meat okay I'll eat it

747
00:43:23,700 --> 00:43:33,700
Patrick me this is I need your meat I put sausage casing on it you think human

748
00:43:33,700 --> 00:43:35,200
- It tastes very good.

749
00:43:35,200 --> 00:43:37,040
- I've heard that human tastes like pork.

750
00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:37,880
- Tastes like pork, yeah.

751
00:43:37,880 --> 00:43:39,900
That's why they called it the long pig.

752
00:43:39,900 --> 00:43:41,980
- What?

753
00:43:41,980 --> 00:43:43,900
- That's what they called it back as a euphemism.

754
00:43:43,900 --> 00:43:45,640
Back when there was cannibalism.

755
00:43:45,640 --> 00:43:47,140
Yeah, well no, back when people would eat it

756
00:43:47,140 --> 00:43:48,620
because of starvation and shit,

757
00:43:48,620 --> 00:43:50,920
they would say, oh yeah, they ate the long pig.

758
00:43:50,920 --> 00:43:53,700
- Would you guys ever eat me?

759
00:43:53,700 --> 00:43:55,900
- Yeah, if it was served to me, I'd eat it.

760
00:43:55,900 --> 00:43:58,740
I don't know how many times I have to say it.

761
00:43:58,740 --> 00:44:01,620
- But why would it be served to you?

762
00:44:01,620 --> 00:44:02,460
If it was me?

763
00:44:02,460 --> 00:44:03,460
- I don't know, you figure it out.

764
00:44:03,460 --> 00:44:04,300
- You cut off your leg.

765
00:44:04,300 --> 00:44:06,020
- I guess I cut off your leg in some way,

766
00:44:06,020 --> 00:44:07,620
so it's kind of my fault.

767
00:44:07,620 --> 00:44:09,500
- You cut off both your butt cheeks.

768
00:44:09,500 --> 00:44:11,540
- I guess if I had to have my leg amputated,

769
00:44:11,540 --> 00:44:12,540
I might eat it.

770
00:44:12,540 --> 00:44:14,060
- Have you ever been like cooking something

771
00:44:14,060 --> 00:44:16,220
and then like cutting something up and be like,

772
00:44:16,220 --> 00:44:17,700
"Man, if I cut off my finger right now,

773
00:44:17,700 --> 00:44:19,540
I would just throw it in the pot and just see what happens."

774
00:44:19,540 --> 00:44:21,620
(laughing)

775
00:44:21,620 --> 00:44:23,060
'Cause I've thought that before.

776
00:44:23,060 --> 00:44:23,900
- Oh yeah.

777
00:44:23,900 --> 00:44:26,060
- It's like, if it's an accident,

778
00:44:26,060 --> 00:44:27,620
like I might as well throw my finger

779
00:44:27,620 --> 00:44:29,940
in this chicken quesadilla and just see what's up.

780
00:44:29,940 --> 00:44:30,780
- Yeah.

781
00:44:30,780 --> 00:44:33,100
- I mean, how much of your finger do you really need?

782
00:44:33,100 --> 00:44:40,940
Exactly. I would say you need eight fingers. Uh-huh. Any more than eight you're kind of bragging. Unless you're a guitarist. If you're a guitarist

783
00:44:40,940 --> 00:44:47,620
you need 12 fingers. You ever know anybody with the extra fingers? I did. I knew a kid who had an extra finger on each hand.

784
00:44:47,620 --> 00:44:51,580
Yeah, there was a girl at my school had an extra thumb. And I just say you fucking freak.

785
00:44:51,580 --> 00:44:55,940
I'd go to his house. His dad was from New Zealand.

786
00:44:55,940 --> 00:45:00,700
I'd just fucking laugh at his hands and his dad would scream at his mom and it's pretty fucking funny.

787
00:45:01,540 --> 00:45:09,100
if Devin's listening we should we should link up dog I like messing with lions at

788
00:45:09,100 --> 00:45:13,460
the zoo I pretend to be a lion and pretend to attack them she's getting

789
00:45:13,460 --> 00:45:18,620
mauled yeah a lion's roar equals the price of admission to a zoo every time

790
00:45:18,620 --> 00:45:22,380
it kind of sucks at the most fun thing you can do at a zoo is try to get one of

791
00:45:22,380 --> 00:45:25,860
the animals to attack you yeah every time I've been to a zoo which haven't been

792
00:45:25,860 --> 00:45:30,780
in since I was a kid I would just be like I'm gonna try to get this gorilla to

793
00:45:30,780 --> 00:45:36,100
think he can kill me I went to the zoo last week I accidentally

794
00:45:36,100 --> 00:45:40,420
wandered into the Central Park Zoo we have in Wilmington there's like a

795
00:45:40,420 --> 00:45:45,620
there's like a very evil zoo called the Trigimbo Animal Park where you walk in

796
00:45:45,620 --> 00:45:49,100
and like the monkeys are fucking smoking cigarettes and they're all just want to

797
00:45:49,100 --> 00:45:53,620
kill themselves the stone zoo used to be evil they've been trying to shut it down for 20 years

798
00:45:53,620 --> 00:45:58,640
and just yeah the stone zoo it used to be like like that they would just have all

799
00:45:58,640 --> 00:46:01,840
the animals in like concrete rooms that were painted blue like a child's

800
00:46:01,840 --> 00:46:06,520
wallpaper. It was so crazy. They still have some of those rooms but some of the

801
00:46:06,520 --> 00:46:10,360
animals have better like space now but it's pretty fucked up. I remember

802
00:46:10,360 --> 00:46:14,240
seeing, because the goat enclosure right is like yeah yeah you can see that

803
00:46:14,240 --> 00:46:18,560
from like the highway yeah yeah the fucking road yeah yeah this is a snow

804
00:46:18,560 --> 00:46:23,880
leopard too. That's the thing about the zoo. When we went there, we went there and we saw

805
00:46:23,880 --> 00:46:28,600
that the Jaguar was just walking was pacing back and forth literally like just

806
00:46:28,600 --> 00:46:33,360
five foot like just the entire time that we were there yeah it was the most

807
00:46:33,360 --> 00:46:36,760
depressing thing that's the thing about zoos though is that like they're they're

808
00:46:36,760 --> 00:46:40,280
just completely illegal you can just you can just abuse the animals all you want

809
00:46:40,280 --> 00:46:44,320
as long as they don't die. It's so it's so yeah to go in there and like try and

810
00:46:44,320 --> 00:46:47,240
justify it yourself and be like well like these animals they're probably like bred

811
00:46:47,240 --> 00:46:50,200
in captivity like they would die if you put them in the wild and then see like a

812
00:46:50,200 --> 00:46:53,480
jaguar just eating its own poop and throwing up over and over again be like

813
00:46:53,480 --> 00:46:58,500
Oh, man, it's like come on. I can't writing help the city the city that the zoo it's like

814
00:46:58,500 --> 00:47:02,980
Where the zoo is depends on how good the zoo is gonna be

815
00:47:02,980 --> 00:47:08,880
Like I feel like the Central Park Zoo is probably like they probably like do a pretty good job cuz it's like there's so many people

816
00:47:08,880 --> 00:47:13,500
There it's like if we fuck up like a bunch of people are gonna see so many people in New York

817
00:47:13,500 --> 00:47:15,500
We'll be like oh you

818
00:47:15,500 --> 00:47:19,520
With the cattle

819
00:47:21,800 --> 00:47:27,240
But then if you're like a monkeys part of they you have to teach him as alpha by hitting them with a big fly

820
00:47:27,240 --> 00:47:31,120
So exactly exactly it's actually helps the monkeys stay in line

821
00:47:31,120 --> 00:47:36,760
If you wear one of their faces like a mask and then acts like you're part of the monkey tree

822
00:47:36,760 --> 00:47:42,200
Yeah, they'll listen to you monkeys actually need a certain level of electric shocks to stay alive exactly

823
00:47:42,200 --> 00:47:47,800
It's actually they're helping. It's the same thing as putting a pacemaker and grandpa. Mm-hmm. Yeah

824
00:47:47,800 --> 00:47:50,720
We're actually we're actually letting

825
00:47:50,720 --> 00:47:52,720
letting the monkeys kind of...

826
00:47:52,720 --> 00:47:55,720
One lucky fan into the gorilla enclosure.

827
00:47:55,720 --> 00:47:57,720
Monkeys actually love pranks and it's part of their culture.

828
00:47:57,720 --> 00:48:01,720
We're giving the monkeys some enrichment by letting them into the herpetarium to play with the frogs.

829
00:48:01,720 --> 00:48:08,720
Because frogs are pretty much nothing so...

830
00:48:08,720 --> 00:48:10,720
And you know there's a video, I mean...

831
00:48:10,720 --> 00:48:12,720
It's water and slime, that's all that's in there.

832
00:48:12,720 --> 00:48:14,720
There's a video of a frog and a monkey playing on YouTube, just look up.

833
00:48:14,720 --> 00:48:18,720
Look up "Monkey Plays With Frog, Very Fun".

834
00:48:18,720 --> 00:48:25,040
That's the title of that video. Number six is Tiger. Who likes penguins when you have

835
00:48:25,040 --> 00:48:29,880
got tigers? All penguins do is waddle around quaking. Whereas tigers are so

836
00:48:29,880 --> 00:48:34,000
sweet and are fluffy, elegant, and cute. They also need our help seeing as they

837
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:37,640
are close to extinction. Would you rather have a fluffy genius or a quaking

838
00:48:37,640 --> 00:48:43,000
penguin? I would choose. Would you rather? Or basically like a look-smacked lion.

839
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:43,840
when you think about it.

840
00:48:43,840 --> 00:48:44,680
- Oh man, dude, tigers are--

841
00:48:44,680 --> 00:48:47,440
- I wanted him to do this for a while.

842
00:48:47,440 --> 00:48:48,340
- Stop it.

843
00:48:48,340 --> 00:48:49,180
- Why?

844
00:48:49,180 --> 00:48:50,000
- It's gross.

845
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:51,960
- You don't wanna see me be beautiful.

846
00:48:51,960 --> 00:48:54,200
- Tigers are amazing, I love tigers.

847
00:48:54,200 --> 00:48:55,320
- Yeah. - Tigers are cool.

848
00:48:55,320 --> 00:48:57,880
- More importantly, would you eat one?

849
00:48:57,880 --> 00:48:58,720
- No.

850
00:48:58,720 --> 00:49:00,960
- What if a viking threw his head on a table

851
00:49:00,960 --> 00:49:03,000
and he said, "Eat!" - My dream, my goal,

852
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:05,440
dream, dreamed goal, okay?

853
00:49:05,440 --> 00:49:09,680
I move to Russia, where it's legal to own a tiger.

854
00:49:09,680 --> 00:49:11,040
- Yep.

855
00:49:11,040 --> 00:49:11,920
- In my house.

856
00:49:11,920 --> 00:49:13,200
- Yep.

857
00:49:13,200 --> 00:49:14,820
- And then I let it eat me.

858
00:49:14,820 --> 00:49:16,480
(laughing)

859
00:49:16,480 --> 00:49:18,180
- All right, it's a horrible dream.

860
00:49:18,180 --> 00:49:23,180
- I'm not letting it eat me, but like, it happens.

861
00:49:23,180 --> 00:49:26,440
- So you wanna be eaten to death?

862
00:49:26,440 --> 00:49:29,400
- I wanna have the companionship of a tiger for long enough.

863
00:49:29,400 --> 00:49:30,240
- Yeah.

864
00:49:30,240 --> 00:49:31,960
- He gets eaten, what do you fucking?

865
00:49:31,960 --> 00:49:33,320
- I live inside the tiger.

866
00:49:33,320 --> 00:49:35,320
- You could live in his stomach like Jonah the Whale.

867
00:49:35,320 --> 00:49:36,840
- Uh-huh, like Eddie Bull.

868
00:49:36,840 --> 00:49:38,240
- Yeah, that's not a bad idea.

869
00:49:38,240 --> 00:49:39,680
- That's a weird reference to Bull.

870
00:49:39,680 --> 00:49:41,320
- I don't know who Eddie Bull is.

871
00:49:41,320 --> 00:49:46,360
it's from Crash Box on HBO oh I remember Crash Box yeah absolutely psycho show oh

872
00:49:46,360 --> 00:49:54,240
that's what I showed cam he would have known it as a child oh I didn't know you

873
00:49:54,240 --> 00:49:58,840
liked Crash Box I love Crash Box dude the fucking creepy snake guy the

874
00:49:58,840 --> 00:50:04,000
revolting slob dude you remember it's so disgusting oh man this guy's my favorite

875
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:08,640
it's my favorite as a kid such a love that guy mm-hmm he would sit there and

876
00:50:08,640 --> 00:50:12,380
just go like "RAWR!" and they're like "What are you even talking about you slob?"

877
00:50:12,380 --> 00:50:16,320
His attitude is A) atrocious B) like...

878
00:50:16,320 --> 00:50:20,760
Yep. It makes sense if that was like most of your schooling experience was watching Crash

879
00:50:20,760 --> 00:50:25,340
Box. Yeah. That's why I'm so smart. That's why you got so smart. It's an HBO show dudes

880
00:50:25,340 --> 00:50:32,340
for the... It's prestige television. Intelligentsia. It's produced by Martin Scorsese.

881
00:50:32,340 --> 00:50:37,660
Number 7, Red Panda. I would not eat this. I would not eat a Red Panda. I would not eat

882
00:50:37,660 --> 00:50:43,840
a red panda. I'd eat it. Wow. What the fuck? Oh well you know what? I guess you're really

883
00:50:43,840 --> 00:50:49,460
sticking your guns on this one. I mean I don't, yeah. Why wouldn't you? Would you fuck one?

884
00:50:49,460 --> 00:50:55,460
No. Okay. So it looks like that's a bit of a double standard on your part. What is your

885
00:50:55,460 --> 00:50:59,500
reason, if somebody handed you a burger and said this is made out of red panda? I don't,

886
00:50:59,500 --> 00:51:05,680
it wouldn't taste good. I like things that taste good. I like cheese and I like taquitos.

887
00:51:05,680 --> 00:51:08,600
I don't want to eat a fucking red panda burger.

888
00:51:08,600 --> 00:51:10,600
How does that make any sense?

889
00:51:10,600 --> 00:51:11,440
- Because it's cool.

890
00:51:11,440 --> 00:51:12,280
- I want to eat nachos.

891
00:51:12,280 --> 00:51:13,600
- It's cool to eat an animal.

892
00:51:13,600 --> 00:51:18,280
- I want to eat fucking carne asada.

893
00:51:18,280 --> 00:51:22,160
- Hey man, if anything, it's actually even more ethical

894
00:51:22,160 --> 00:51:24,200
to eat something like a red panda or a tiger

895
00:51:24,200 --> 00:51:25,640
'cause they're not factory farmed.

896
00:51:25,640 --> 00:51:27,600
So you know they lived a good life.

897
00:51:27,600 --> 00:51:28,420
- It's true.

898
00:51:28,420 --> 00:51:29,260
You know what?

899
00:51:29,260 --> 00:51:30,080
- They lived a good life,

900
00:51:30,080 --> 00:51:31,640
they got fucking shot with a crossbow.

901
00:51:31,640 --> 00:51:32,480
- You don't know that.

902
00:51:32,480 --> 00:51:33,720
- You don't say, here's the thing.

903
00:51:33,720 --> 00:51:36,760
People say this about like farm raised animals,

904
00:51:36,760 --> 00:51:38,280
like oh they lived a good life.

905
00:51:38,280 --> 00:51:42,740
But if your grandpa died by having a bolt shot into his head,

906
00:51:42,740 --> 00:51:44,320
you'd be like, well he lived a--

907
00:51:44,320 --> 00:51:47,480
- Yeah, but I don't think people are raising tigers on farms.

908
00:51:47,480 --> 00:51:48,320
- They are.

909
00:51:48,320 --> 00:51:49,380
- No, they're not.

910
00:51:49,380 --> 00:51:50,220
- They are.

911
00:51:50,220 --> 00:51:52,080
- They're in the jungle, that's the tiger burger.

912
00:51:52,080 --> 00:51:55,040
- No, they're raising tigers on farms in various places.

913
00:51:55,040 --> 00:51:57,600
- I'm gonna raise a tiger in your apartment.

914
00:51:57,600 --> 00:51:59,000
- That'd be fine, I'd probably get a long one.

915
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:00,080
- I'm gonna raise it from the dead.

916
00:52:00,080 --> 00:52:01,500
- Probably teach him how to love.

917
00:52:01,500 --> 00:52:02,680
- Shit.

918
00:52:02,680 --> 00:52:06,880
what did you learn about the dentist again no I learned about crash box it

919
00:52:06,880 --> 00:52:10,080
was not produced by Martin Scorsese I don't remember why yeah I didn't sound

920
00:52:10,080 --> 00:52:15,480
right yeah I was like I I remember I I was like maybe there's somebody on the

921
00:52:15,480 --> 00:52:19,800
cast that's named looks like Martin Scorsese cuz now I'm just like oh you're

922
00:52:19,800 --> 00:52:24,640
thinking of Marlon Corcrezi ah yeah that guy's nuts he was crazy

923
00:52:24,640 --> 00:52:29,120
yeah he was insane he would just yeah that's why he made fucking crash box

924
00:52:29,120 --> 00:52:32,800
Yeah, exactly. He twisted mine. Marlon's so crazy.

925
00:52:32,800 --> 00:52:35,360
[Laughter]

926
00:52:35,360 --> 00:52:36,080
Number eight.

927
00:52:36,080 --> 00:52:40,160
Number eight. I love being able to get close to an elephant. They don't seem it,

928
00:52:40,160 --> 00:52:43,440
but they have skin that feels like a tire. I know because I got to pet one.

929
00:52:43,440 --> 00:52:46,720
Would you, okay, you'd eat an elephant, I know this.

930
00:52:46,720 --> 00:52:49,280
Would you drive an elephant car?

931
00:52:49,280 --> 00:52:50,240
Yeah.

932
00:52:50,240 --> 00:52:50,960
Ooh, yes.

933
00:52:50,960 --> 00:52:52,560
Where you have to put your feet out of the bottom.

934
00:52:52,560 --> 00:52:52,880
Uh-huh.

935
00:52:52,880 --> 00:52:53,120
Yeah.

936
00:52:53,120 --> 00:52:58,880
Exactly. Yeah, I would drive it. I would put elephant skin tires on my shit.

937
00:52:58,880 --> 00:53:04,160
Dude, oh my god. An eleph- imagine bringing your elephant through the drive-thru.

938
00:53:04,160 --> 00:53:09,680
Well no, I'm saying would you like an ele- like you kill an elephant, you turn its fucking skin

939
00:53:09,680 --> 00:53:14,880
and bones into a car. You contact Toyota, you have them custom build it for you.

940
00:53:14,880 --> 00:53:18,560
Okay, I yeah, I completely didn't understand what you were talking about.

941
00:53:18,560 --> 00:53:22,080
An elephant car, not an el- not just an ele- anybody can ride an elephant.

942
00:53:22,080 --> 00:53:25,360
I thought you meant like an elephant with big wheels, like a monster truck elephant.

943
00:53:25,360 --> 00:53:30,880
Like a fucking like an axle from twisted metal with an elephant? No! That would make sense.

944
00:53:30,880 --> 00:53:35,200
I mean that is kind of fucking sick actually. Now that I think about it, yeah let's do that instead.

945
00:53:35,200 --> 00:53:39,360
Would you drive that? Yeah that's what I was thinking. Dude I'd drive anything as long as

946
00:53:39,360 --> 00:53:46,320
you put in front of me. Yeah once I get my license it's my first car. Yeah this here's a call to

947
00:53:46,320 --> 00:53:50,160
action on this one. Elephants are like really big sweet babies. If you are gentle around them they

948
00:53:50,160 --> 00:53:53,840
will be gentle with you. They are so sweet. I love elephants. They are amazing. Also please go to

949
00:53:53,840 --> 00:53:59,040
a world best dog breeds and vote for boxers no best animal poachers hunters

950
00:53:59,040 --> 00:54:03,840
circuses need to all go to hell and same with elephants predators they can't help

951
00:54:03,840 --> 00:54:08,920
it dude poachers they can't know the predator the fucking like a lion that

952
00:54:08,920 --> 00:54:13,080
eats an elephant oh that thing doesn't need to go to hell yeah it's true that'd

953
00:54:13,080 --> 00:54:17,520
be kind of funny though if the hell was like all humans and then some Tigers

954
00:54:17,520 --> 00:54:24,040
like I guess that's part of it yeah true yeah they might like that actually number

955
00:54:24,040 --> 00:54:31,480
nine skrillas yeah I yeah gorillas don't scare me as much learning that they're

956
00:54:31,480 --> 00:54:36,760
like five five yeah yeah well I mean a six-foot gorilla that's a fucking that's

957
00:54:36,760 --> 00:54:43,000
a problem a five five gorilla you know it's easy to yeah I don't know I think I

958
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:49,180
I think if I'm if I'm tall enough his arm span he won't be able to rip me in half

959
00:54:49,180 --> 00:54:56,760
right because I don't know short guys are short guys are angry no they're not yeah

960
00:54:56,760 --> 00:55:03,040
not no they're not tiny guys okay a tiny guys get really mad at a jacked tiny guy

961
00:55:03,040 --> 00:55:07,880
like a five foot five jacked guy you really really be angry a really weak guy

962
00:55:07,880 --> 00:55:11,240
who's one inch tall usually gets angry when people say stuff about him on

963
00:55:11,240 --> 00:55:24,040
inter yeah recording they also love to pretend they don't know what's going on

964
00:55:24,040 --> 00:55:28,400
I know exactly what's going on right now it's one of the craziest things which is

965
00:55:28,400 --> 00:55:32,760
so fucked up about yeah and also I'm like the same size as Pat and I'm not

966
00:55:32,760 --> 00:55:38,960
skinny I'm fucking humongously fat no and I

967
00:55:38,960 --> 00:55:43,920
skinny let's not get ahead of ourselves. You called me skinny and you can't take that back.

968
00:55:43,920 --> 00:55:46,640
I did not call you skinny. I'm gonna stick it in my head. I called you one inch tall.

969
00:55:46,640 --> 00:55:52,720
You think that's skinny? Yeah. Well if you're one inch tall. I'm not. So you don't have to go any

970
00:55:52,720 --> 00:55:58,240
further. I'm speaking hypothetically here. Okay all right I'll give you a hypothetical. Yeah if

971
00:55:58,240 --> 00:56:01,200
I was one inch tall. Hypothetically if Caleb was five foot nine. If I was one inch tall then you'd

972
00:56:01,200 --> 00:56:06,560
be point nine inches tall. No uh shut the f- shut your fucking mouth. That'd basically be the deal.

973
00:56:06,560 --> 00:56:12,800
no no we're no your your wife measured us and you're the same height I don't

974
00:56:12,800 --> 00:56:18,040
remember that on this again it's okay no no that one is one is one is wise to him

975
00:56:18,040 --> 00:56:21,560
about about the other one is two inches tall have you guys ever heard of a

976
00:56:21,560 --> 00:56:25,240
little something called mental stature

977
00:56:25,240 --> 00:56:31,440
cuz mentally I'm five mental mental stature was a pitcher for the Pittsburgh

978
00:56:31,440 --> 00:56:37,360
pirates in the 1900s. I want to get to my favorite comment on here. Okay,

979
00:56:37,360 --> 00:56:43,880
number 10 giant panda. Here's the top comment. Oh, really? Pandas totally are

980
00:56:43,880 --> 00:56:48,260
incredibly awfully insanely terrible. It was one of the worst animals in the

981
00:56:48,260 --> 00:56:52,000
universe. Everybody say these cute little darlings are the best and are so

982
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:55,460
good and they could kill anybody. They are the most endangered animals. No,

983
00:56:55,460 --> 00:56:59,100
that's not even true. There are a kind of hammerhead shark that have only have

984
00:56:59,100 --> 00:57:03,860
one eye and there is one of them left. That was way more endangered than these dumb butts.

985
00:57:03,860 --> 00:57:09,100
I have a list of which animals do you hate most. Top one, bugs. Top two, pandas. Top

986
00:57:09,100 --> 00:57:13,100
three, rabbits. Top four, koalas. Top five, deer.

987
00:57:13,100 --> 00:57:18,460
Deer? Bugs is kind of a wide net to catch there, partner.

988
00:57:18,460 --> 00:57:21,180
A huge top one. That's like most of life on earth.

989
00:57:21,180 --> 00:57:25,100
Also, putting pandas and koalas is so funny. Just being like, "I hate these endangered

990
00:57:25,100 --> 00:57:28,340
animals because there's actually a shark that's more endangered."

991
00:57:28,340 --> 00:57:34,420
deer though I'm taking deer is weird - no I'm on his side fuck you no no no I

992
00:57:34,420 --> 00:57:40,780
think deer my favorite favorite run in front of cars yeah it's not cool there's

993
00:57:40,780 --> 00:57:43,660
fucking lemmings they just love to kill themselves

994
00:57:43,660 --> 00:57:48,260
uh-huh it's spiritual dude that is ever looked at a deer and that's a it's it's

995
00:57:48,260 --> 00:57:51,740
Native Americans used to run over deer with their cars and it was actually a

996
00:57:51,740 --> 00:57:56,420
very it was a very spiritual and intense moment dude have you ever looked at it

997
00:57:56,420 --> 00:58:00,160
just like seen a deer just walking or just eating out of the woods or whatever

998
00:58:00,160 --> 00:58:06,760
yeah they look like shit they look really awesome dude a doe look at a doe

999
00:58:06,760 --> 00:58:11,360
in the eyes seeing a love with a deer you fucking weirdo deer with big antlers

1000
00:58:11,360 --> 00:58:15,740
while you're camping is so cool I hate deers one time I fed a deer an apple out

1001
00:58:15,740 --> 00:58:19,720

1006
00:58:43,740 --> 00:58:47,540

00:58:47,540 --> 00:58:51,460

1008
00:58:51,460 --> 00:58:52,300
I'm just scrolling through here.

1009
00:58:52,300 --> 00:58:54,060
Number 50 is goose.

1010
00:58:54,060 --> 00:58:55,940
- You skipped, you skipped meerkat.

1011
00:58:55,940 --> 00:58:56,900
- I skipped a lot of stuff.

1012
00:58:56,900 --> 00:58:57,740
I went to 50, do you know what I'm talking about?

1013
00:58:57,740 --> 00:59:00,660
- Yeah, I know, but meerkat, that's like the best.

1014
00:59:00,660 --> 00:59:02,340
- Number 50 is goose. - That's number one for me.

1015
00:59:02,340 --> 00:59:05,780
- And the top comment is, dude, if your zoo has no geese,

1016
00:59:05,780 --> 00:59:07,060
that is not our problem.

1017
00:59:07,060 --> 00:59:08,100
Get a better zoo.

1018
00:59:08,100 --> 00:59:10,040
(laughing)

1019
00:59:10,040 --> 00:59:11,820
- I don't fuck with geese either.

1020
00:59:11,820 --> 00:59:12,820
I do not like geese.

1021
00:59:12,820 --> 00:59:13,660
- Geese suck.

1022
00:59:13,660 --> 00:59:14,660
- Yeah. - Geese are the worst.

1023
00:59:14,660 --> 00:59:15,940
- Fucking stupid ass, man.

1024
00:59:15,940 --> 00:59:16,780
Shut up, dude.

1025
00:59:16,780 --> 00:59:18,100
Why are you honking?

1026
00:59:18,100 --> 00:59:20,500
Also, they get really mad if you try to steal their kids.

1027
00:59:20,500 --> 00:59:21,500
Yeah, true.

1028
00:59:21,500 --> 00:59:23,060
If you try to kill them, they get so pissed off.

1029
00:59:23,060 --> 00:59:24,060
Yeah, they get really pissed off.

1030
00:59:24,060 --> 00:59:25,380
If you try to steal a goose egg, oh my God.

1031
00:59:25,380 --> 00:59:27,060
Dude, do you not understand the food chain?

1032
00:59:27,060 --> 00:59:28,300
I'm supposed to do this to you.

1033
00:59:28,300 --> 00:59:29,300
Do you not get it?

1034
00:59:29,300 --> 00:59:30,300
I need this golden egg.

1035
00:59:30,300 --> 00:59:34,380
I got to kill you in this mall parking lot so that I can maybe win the egg lottery and

1036
00:59:34,380 --> 00:59:35,380

1037
00:59:35,380 --> 00:59:36,380
I need this golden egg.

1038
00:59:36,380 --> 00:59:37,380
Come on.

1039
00:59:37,380 --> 00:59:38,380
That's what happened to Donald Trump.

1040
00:59:38,380 --> 00:59:42,980
Donald Trump found a golden geese egg and he became the most rich guy of all time.

1041
00:59:42,980 --> 00:59:43,980
I'm trying to be like him.

1042
00:59:43,980 --> 00:59:47,180
You make a golden goose.

1043
00:59:47,180 --> 00:59:48,180

1044
00:59:48,180 --> 00:59:49,740

00:59:49,740 --> 00:59:52,180
No, shut-- no. Shut up.

1048
00:59:56,180 --> 00:59:58,180
The Clouded Leopard.

01:00:02,860 --> 01:00:05,860
Number 142 is Little Penguin.

1051
01:00:05,860 --> 01:00:07,860

Number 87 is Hedgehog.

1055
01:00:16,860 --> 01:00:18,860
What fucking zoo has a hedgehog?

1056
01:00:18,860 --> 01:00:30,820
Number 60 is bongo and the only common is bongo go-go. Number 187 is fly. That's a

1057
01:00:30,820 --> 01:00:37,140
terrible zoo animal. The last one, the final one on the list, number 199, sugar

1058
01:00:37,140 --> 01:00:43,220
ants. Nobody's going to the zoo to see a sugar ant. Number 198 right before that, dog.

1059
01:00:43,220 --> 01:01:01,260
more

1060
01:01:01,260 --> 01:01:05,420
