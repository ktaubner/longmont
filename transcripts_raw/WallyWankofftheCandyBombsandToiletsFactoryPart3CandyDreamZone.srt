2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,800
Last time on Wally Wankoff and the Candy Bombs and Toilets Factory.

3
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:14,600
The four remaining winners of the Brown Sticker Competition finally entered the factory, where

4
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:18,600
they were greeted by the sterile chaos of a modern mega-corporation.

5
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:23,000
While it appeared to be a well-oiled machine, Wankoff led them to a room that was suffering

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
from a peculiar plague of mismanagement or non-management.

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
The Chocolate Swamp.

8
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,440
The room was supposed to be where all the chocolate is made, but no chocolate has been made in

9
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:37,680
years since the swamp and the poop from the sewer system and toilet manufacturing part

10
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:44,320
of the factory has infiltrated the chocolate swamp, making it a confusing, smelly mess.

11
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:49,480
A babble-like tower made of chocolate and sludge lingered in the distance of the swamp,

12
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:54,280
and so Wankov suggested they head in that direction on his speedboat, attended by one

13
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:58,200
of the frog workers, known as Sullivans.

14
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:02,760
The Sullivans sang their song about how they are slaves, and lamented to Wankoff about how

15
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:06,220
they built the tower to protect themselves from the swamp monster that has been terrorizing

16
00:01:06,220 --> 00:01:07,220
them for years.

17
00:01:07,220 --> 00:01:13,360
The swamp monster then made an appearance, and after Waylon Au Revoir cleverly appealed

18
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:18,600
to his better nature by feeding him treats, the gang spotted a tube sticking out of the

19
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:25,760
swamp monster's backside that was pumping it full of shit, making it big and angry.

20
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:30,640
Our heroes acted quickly, defeating the two, though not without some serious casualties.

21
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:35,340
Weyland suffering the most damage, and nor without Pinocchio discovering that when he

22
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:40,860
tells jokes, his nose grows in diameter, turning him into some kind of horrifying freak with

23
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:43,980
essentially a tree trunk on his face.

24
00:01:43,980 --> 00:01:48,700
Afterwards, the gang determined that they should head to the control room where Wankov could

25
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:51,120
fix most everything.

26
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:56,040
To do that, however, they needed to travel through the very dilapidated, now sewer-like,

27
00:01:56,040 --> 00:02:01,800
toilet room pipe network from which the tube that was pumping the monster full of shit

28
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:02,800
had sprung.

29
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:05,040
That's a lot of tube there.

30
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:10,280
Arriving there, they found a beautiful woman made of shit named Lady Dibby, who led them

31
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:15,080
to a weaker portion of the piping in the toilet room network of pipe things that they're

32
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:19,280
in, sort of a weaker portion of it that they could reach the control room from if they're

33
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:27,360
able to break it down. However, Turdevils, a quickly reskinned enemy that are turkeys

34
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:35,400
with devils inside of them, hover around that area of the pipe. So, they have to be taken

35
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:43,800
care of. So, after Waylon did some looney-tuned antics, the battle began in earnest. And here

36
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:47,240
Here we are at the battle.

37
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:49,320
What did we get for initiatives gang?

38
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:50,840
I didn't roll it yet.

39
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:51,840
Oh my god.

40
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:53,840
I got distracted.

41
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:54,840
17.

42
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:55,840
Nice.

43
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:56,840
Create one.

44
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:57,840
Three.

45
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:58,840
Okay.

46
00:02:58,840 --> 00:02:59,840
Pinocchio.

47
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:09,320
I forgot Pinocchio, did you prepare anything for this?

48
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:10,320
Or no?

49
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:14,960
I well I was thinking I would stop spinning around like a top and

50
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:22,200
Then maybe I would maybe fall over and start kind of rolling towards him very slowly. I like that

51
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:24,320
So you're in the middle of doing that?

52
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:28,780
Yeah, I'm like, I'm pretty busy with that. So if you could like get off my case like that. Yep. Sorry

53
00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:31,960
We've had this problem before I'm sorry

54
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:34,880
Okay

55
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:39,040
And that's her devil's whose move set has been adjusted

56
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:46,040
it

57
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:48,040
Oh wait, Bibby!

58
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:50,040
Oh yeah, I have a sling attack.

59
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:52,040
Prepared.

60
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:54,040
Things have gone south.

61
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:56,040
Thirteen.

62
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:58,040
That's enough.

63
00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:00,040
Eight sling damage.

64
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:02,040
Good gosh.

65
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:04,040
I'm shooting, also my sling ammo is my teeth

66
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:06,040
that fell out.

67
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:08,040
Which one are you shooting?

68
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:10,040
My tooth.

69
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:12,040
Which turd do you have?

70
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:14,040
I guess I'll just go for the one

71
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:18,480
that Waylon is also stabbing. Yeah. Good. Yeah. That one is

72
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:21,360
not looking good. It just got stabbed in the throat and then

73
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:25,800
a tooth I guess hurled at its cranium. Um so he's looking in

74
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:30,000
dire straits. Uh you're up now Waylon though. You just stabbed

75
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,400
this guy in front of you. Oh, whoa. Okay. Um I will cast uh

76
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:39,240
Dissonant Whispers. Beautiful. At the same one or a different

77
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:45,000
different one. I'll do a different one. Hell yeah. I'll look to his friend and I'll

78
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:54,680
point to him and I'll whisper like "I have to go out to Wabbaja, put my money on it." Baby talk. Yeah. Fuck him up. Yeah, go for it.

79
00:04:54,680 --> 00:05:03,400
Where is... yo, shit, there it is. Alright, what'd you get on that? I got a four. You got a four

80
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:07,280
damage? Okay cool. Wow, that's crazy. Alright, I'll roll the resistance for that,

81
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:16,080
which is not very good. It'd be to 14 right? Yeah. Alright. They're not very uh wise.

82
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:22,480
So says you. Yeah. Well, they could have been wiser here. They actually really just

83
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:26,440
rolled very low. So, yeah, they're gonna take that full four damage. This uh you

84
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:31,920
get the one in the back or the one that was near it. Uh I'll do the one. Yeah, the

85
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:35,640
one right next to him. I'll like point to him like you're. Yeah. Yeah, he's just

86
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:39,480
like freaking out now he's like eyes are wide like a woman just stabbed his

87
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:45,120
friend and a tooth came out of nowhere and he's like just so so upset and

88
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:49,120
you're going by the way good at it and like it's it's not a pretty sight for

89
00:05:49,120 --> 00:06:01,320
him unless you want to do like a bardic inspo yeah I'll do I'll do a bardic inspo

90
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:09,440
what is that sorry I don't remember what that is or does so as a bard you you can

91
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:15,420
basically like look to somebody and do a little dance or a little jig or play a

92
00:06:15,420 --> 00:06:19,040
little tune and you give them 1d6 that they can use in any like ability check

93
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:24,240
or saving throw or okay yeah yeah I'll look at John Candy who I think is like

94
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:31,240
right next to him too. I'll do a little dance for him.

95
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:36,240
Go! Go! Yeah!

96
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:42,240
Okay, cool. So you got a d6 you can spend on shit now. You're raging by the way, John

97
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:47,240
Candy. We have to resolve that. We've got to resolve that. So roll that table. Let's

98
00:06:47,240 --> 00:07:02,720
the

99
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:20,960
to

100
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:24,400
hits you with the attack roll before your rage ends.

101
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:27,920
That creature takes 1d6 force damage as magic lashes out in

102
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:33,680
retribution. We now know what happened to your nephew.

103
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:39,840
Cool. Yeah. So you have these like magical tendrils sort of

104
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:44,160
whipping around you as this lawyer boy is doing a lawyer

105
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:48,720
dance for you and you're feeling pretty good there, but

106
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:50,220
we're going to go to Bibby.

107
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:51,920
Yes, you're up.

108
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:54,420
You just lost a tooth at one of these two devils.

109
00:07:54,420 --> 00:07:55,920
Yes, I did.

110
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:58,520
I'm going to run up to a different one.

111
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:02,320
There's one is there one that hasn't been damaged yet?

112
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:03,320
Yeah, that one.

113
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:05,520
I don't know if you're going to reach on like one round of

114
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:06,020
movement.

115
00:08:06,020 --> 00:08:08,320
All right, then I'll go to the one that's been damaged a

116
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:08,920
little bit.

117
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:11,020
Yeah, if I can reach that one.

118
00:08:11,020 --> 00:08:12,120
Yeah that one you could reach.

119
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:15,220
Okay, and I'm going to use I'm going to attack with my

120
00:08:15,220 --> 00:08:16,020
crutches.

121
00:08:16,020 --> 00:08:18,520
Amazing first.

122
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:22,420
Mm-hmm. That's a 20. Yeah, that hits 3020.

123
00:08:22,420 --> 00:08:27,220
That's 12 damage. Jesus Christ and then I'm going to spend a

124
00:08:27,220 --> 00:08:35,920
key point to do a flurry of blows to make two additional

125
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:40,920
unarmed strikes. We're going to be a one to kick. Hell. Yes.

126
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:47,320
That's a nine. Nope. Okay. That is a twenty. Yep. That is six

127
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:59,720
damage. Nope. Nope. I'll put that out. Sorry. Yeah, describe your kill. Yeah, I'm just going

128
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:06,120
I'm just kind of going crazy. Like I just I just I bound over there on my on my crutches

129
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:11,480
and I swing my crutch and like when I hit when I hit the turd devil with my crutch I like

130
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:18,200
fall over because I lose I lose one of my crutches and I kind of just accidentally kick the bottom

131
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:23,000
of the turd devil and the devil flies up out of the turkey and like lands in the poop water.

132
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:30,280
Yeah exactly. Yeah I was flying up and just face plant into the water.

133
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:35,320
It's little little red asses out and he's face down like a little turtle.

134
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:43,000
Yeah, you say that too. Uh and now it's the turd devil's turn. So,

135
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:50,200
the one that um attacked you or you attacked uh Waylon is uh

136
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:54,920
going to try to like like clack at you with its little uh

137
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:58,600
turd devil beak. Um. Yeah, fair's fair. Yeah, right? Makes

138
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:05,400
sense. Um let's see how it does. Uh what is your AC? I should

00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:08,700
Just have 1212 OK just misses it.

140

Clack see you and misses and

141
00:10:10,660 --> 00:10:12,860
then it's going to whip around

142
00:10:12,860 --> 00:10:15,120
and look to you Pinocchio as

143
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:16,940
you're rolling towards it.

144
00:10:16,940 --> 00:10:19,260
It suddenly gets alarmed by you

145
00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:22,360
and its stomach slice opens up.

146
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:25,980
A devil opens it up and goes and just

147
00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:29,760
shoots lasers out of its eyes at you.

148
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:32,380
Yeah, yeah, now that's happening.

149
00:10:32,380 --> 00:10:33,740
Yeah, thanks a lot.

150
00:10:33,740 --> 00:10:35,340
Okay, and he misses though.

151
00:10:35,340 --> 00:10:36,840
Great.

152
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:40,940
And yeah, the other devil now from the back is going to

153
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:46,040
shake its feathers around creating a little like sort of

154
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:51,640
shit stirring up a little bit of shit around it making it a

155
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:57,740
little bit harder to hit for a little while and then the devil

156
00:10:57,740 --> 00:11:01,040
that's gonna rip open the stomach out of that turd devil and

157
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:03,740
shoot at you, uh, baby.

158
00:11:03,740 --> 00:11:05,680
After you killed his friend.

159
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:08,600
That's right.

160
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:09,680
That hits you for sure.

161
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:11,760
Oh yeah.

162
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:13,000
Oh, indeed.

163
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,960
How much damage?

164
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:17,840
What?

165
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:19,000
Oh, sorry.

166
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:24,560
I just rolled something and say by accident.

167
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:27,160
Uh, okay.

168
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:28,160
There's 11 damage.

169
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:28,960
Okay.

170
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:30,160
You dead?

171
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:31,560
I'm at eight.

172
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:32,560
Yeah.

173
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:33,560
Okay.

174
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:34,560
Awesome.

175
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:35,560
So now we're back to the top of the order.

176
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:37,120
Waylon, au revoir.

177
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:38,120
You are up.

178
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:40,280
Wait, so I didn't really get to go, huh?

179
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:41,400
Oh, I'm an idiot.

180
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:42,400
I'm so sorry.

181
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:44,760
I just, I'm like nothing to you.

182
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:45,760
I'm like trash basically.

183
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:46,760
Did I, did I?

184
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:47,760
I went with the-

185
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:48,760
John, you go.

186
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:49,760
John, you go.

187
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:50,760
Actually, John came.

188
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:51,760
And then Pinocchio, I'm so sorry.

189
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:52,760
I was looking at the turn order and got confused.

190
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:53,760
You're looking at it and you thought, "I'm just not going to follow this?"

191
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:54,760
Yeah.

192
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:55,760
I was like, "Oh, I'm just going to follow this."

193
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:56,760
I'm like, "Oh, I'm just going to follow this."

194
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:59,960
You're looking at it and you thought, "I'm just not going to follow this."

195
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:00,960
Yeah.

196
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:01,960
No, wait.

197
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:05,960
How is you looking at the turn order make it?

198
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:10,360
That makes it way worse, actually.

199
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:12,120
Precisely the issue.

200
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:15,960
The things that were at my eye level were not helping.

201
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:18,560
It still doesn't help.

202
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:19,560
You know what?

203
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:21,960
One day I'll draw a diagram and it'll make some sense.

204
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:22,960
All right.

205
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:23,960
Yeah, you're up, John.

206
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:26,360
Are there any magic items nearby?

207
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:31,320
*laughter*

208
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:32,660
Yeah man, what's up?

209
00:12:32,660 --> 00:12:34,660
Is there any magic items?

210
00:12:34,660 --> 00:12:38,160
No, no, no, what are you- what- I need- what's the motive?

211
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:40,160
Well, well, well tell me first.

212
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:41,560
To use the magic items.

213
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:43,360
Are you trying to trick me?

214
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:45,860
No, there's no magic items nearby.

215
00:12:45,860 --> 00:12:47,860
Tell me what the motive is, let's figure something out.

216
00:12:47,860 --> 00:12:51,560
Are there any spells nearby?

217
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:52,260
Yeah.

218
00:12:52,260 --> 00:12:53,860
Do you mean like spell scrolls?

219
00:12:53,860 --> 00:12:54,860
Yes.

220
00:12:54,860 --> 00:12:55,860
No.

221
00:12:55,860 --> 00:12:58,580
Okay, then never mind.

222
00:12:58,580 --> 00:12:59,580
I won't use this action.

223
00:12:59,580 --> 00:13:04,060
Okay, what are you going to do?

224
00:13:04,060 --> 00:13:07,100
So I'm in a I'm in rage now, right?

225
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:08,100
That's right.

226
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:09,100
Yeah.

227
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:12,220
And I have the so anyone takes damage from me.

228
00:13:12,220 --> 00:13:14,820
Uh, what was it again?

229
00:13:14,820 --> 00:13:15,820
Hold on.

230
00:13:15,820 --> 00:13:16,820
Let me read this.

231
00:13:16,820 --> 00:13:17,820
Somebody hits you.

232
00:13:17,820 --> 00:13:20,300
They're gonna basically have to deal with them like a meant magical.

233
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:21,300
Oh, yeah.

234
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:22,940
One d six of force damage.

235
00:13:22,940 --> 00:13:23,940
Yeah.

236
00:13:23,940 --> 00:13:29,540
Okay. In the meantime, you have bonuses to your attacks while

237
00:13:29,540 --> 00:13:36,260
you're raging. Oh, alright. Then, I'll just yeah, I guess

238
00:13:36,260 --> 00:13:41,940
I'll just like how close am I to one of these turd devils? I

239
00:13:41,940 --> 00:13:46,420
mean, you're in range of I would say of the one that is

240
00:13:46,420 --> 00:13:49,620
like nearest that's the one that's near Arvo because you

241
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:52,420
haven't really moved yet. So, you're the one that's near

242
00:13:52,420 --> 00:13:52,920
We learn.

243
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:53,720
All right.

244
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:55,720
I'm just going to hit him with my whip.

245
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:56,220
Then.

246
00:13:56,220 --> 00:13:57,820
Yeah, you take out your belt.

247
00:13:57,820 --> 00:14:01,820
Do I roll that with advantage or something or no?

248
00:14:01,820 --> 00:14:05,320
So instead you just you're just going to add more damage when

249
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:06,220
you when you hit.

250
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:08,420
Okay, so roll first.

251
00:14:08,420 --> 00:14:10,320
Oh 2419.

252
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:11,220
They both hit.

253
00:14:11,220 --> 00:14:14,620
Yeah for damage and we're going to add an additional two to

254
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:15,120
that.

255
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:15,720
Okay.

256
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:17,520
Yeah, let's describe your kill.

257
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:18,420
That was just enough.

258
00:14:18,420 --> 00:14:19,720
Yo, okay.

259
00:14:21,620 --> 00:14:25,120
I see that I see that Waylon stop dancing and I'm like,

260
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:27,320
what the fuck?

261
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:29,920
What the fuck? Keep dancing.

262
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:32,520
I want to whip to him to keep dancing.

263
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:35,120
I miss completely.

264
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:37,120
And I just just take the head off.

265
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:39,120
It's her devil. Yeah.

266
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:41,480
Yeah. And it runs around with its head off.

267
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:45,980
And then the devil's head pops out and its head comes off and it UHF style.

268
00:14:45,980 --> 00:14:49,060
I want the head off. Yes. Perfect. Yeah.

269
00:14:49,420 --> 00:14:54,220
And it just sort of sputters and calms down forever.

270
00:14:54,220 --> 00:14:57,660
Wait, so you said he whips the head off and then a second head comes up.

271
00:14:57,660 --> 00:14:58,460
The devil's head.

272
00:14:58,460 --> 00:15:00,540
Hit by nothing, it also falls off.

273
00:15:00,540 --> 00:15:01,580
Yeah, it just falls off.

274
00:15:01,580 --> 00:15:02,380
Yeah, it just falls off.

275
00:15:02,380 --> 00:15:02,940
From sadness.

276
00:15:02,940 --> 00:15:05,100
It just also falls off.

277
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:10,300
Yeah, we play fast and loose when it comes to death here.

278
00:15:10,300 --> 00:15:13,100
Anything can happen.

279
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:14,060
My head flies off.

280
00:15:14,060 --> 00:15:16,380
Yeah, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

281
00:15:16,380 --> 00:15:18,380
Pinocchio.

282
00:15:18,380 --> 00:15:20,380
What's up, Playboy?

283
00:15:20,380 --> 00:15:22,380
Um, okay, so I'm gonna use...

284
00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:26,380
So I don't have this pillar face thing on my attack list, do I?

285
00:15:26,380 --> 00:15:28,380
You have it. It's gonna be...

286
00:15:28,380 --> 00:15:30,380
If you scroll down...

287
00:15:30,380 --> 00:15:32,380
Oh, okay, there it is.

288
00:15:32,380 --> 00:15:36,380
So I'm gonna start... How many turduckins or turdevils are there left?

289
00:15:36,380 --> 00:15:38,380
There's only one.

290
00:15:38,380 --> 00:15:40,380
Okay, I'm gonna start rolling at him pretty slow at first.

291
00:15:40,380 --> 00:15:44,380
I was gonna say, because this one is the one that's a bit further away,

292
00:15:44,380 --> 00:15:46,380
but you have an extra five feet of range on this thing.

293
00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:51,340
range on this thing so you can reach it. So I'm gonna use

294
00:15:51,340 --> 00:15:56,620
pillar face. Hell yeah. Seventeen that hits roll for

295
00:15:56,620 --> 00:15:59,100
damage.

296
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:05,340
Nine great. So how do you do you just collapse on them? I

297
00:16:05,340 --> 00:16:11,820
want you to I keep rolling and II like I flatten him like

298
00:16:11,820 --> 00:16:18,060
like judge doom at the end of who framed roger rabbit yeah and his eyes get really big and

299
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:24,540

302
00:16:37,340 --> 00:16:42,940
I think I'm so afraid of John Candy who just said dance and whipped at me.

303
00:16:42,940 --> 00:16:46,140
I'm gonna keep dance. I'm gonna give another bardic inspiration to him. Can I do that?

304
00:16:46,140 --> 00:16:47,740
Yeah, yeah you can.

305
00:16:47,740 --> 00:16:51,740
Yeah, I don't think I take any other action though. I'm terrified.

306
00:16:51,740 --> 00:16:53,740
It's normal.

307
00:16:53,740 --> 00:16:55,740
Just with panic in my eyes.

308
00:16:55,740 --> 00:16:58,540
What dance do you do? Yeah, what song do you sing?

309
00:16:58,540 --> 00:17:06,140

It got rolled over and it's like

Good as as as as the Lord.

00:18:58,040 --> 00:19:00,240
Yeah, what?

345
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:01,340
I don't know.

346
00:19:01,340 --> 00:19:04,440
I had a problem there motor motor.

347
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:06,440
Oh God.

348
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:07,640
I'm sorry.

349
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:08,940
I'm moving this week.

350
00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:13,940
Okay, is it's her is it's her devil's turn now.

351
00:19:13,940 --> 00:19:20,040
And so it's going to as it's starting to spring back up Pinocchio.

352
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:23,520
it is going to try to clack at you because you are just sort of rolling around nearby

353
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:24,520
it.

354
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:28,820
Um, and you did also my, my vision is so blurred by the speed that I'm like, I don't really

355
00:19:28,820 --> 00:19:29,820
know what I'm doing.

356
00:19:29,820 --> 00:19:30,820
What's your AC?

357
00:19:30,820 --> 00:19:31,820
Uh, 14.

358
00:19:31,820 --> 00:19:32,820
Yeah.

359
00:19:32,820 --> 00:19:33,820
It's itch you.

360
00:19:33,820 --> 00:19:34,820
Okay.

361
00:19:34,820 --> 00:19:35,820
Again, I don't, I have no really awareness of my sense.

362
00:19:35,820 --> 00:19:36,820
It might as well be like a mosquito bite.

363
00:19:36,820 --> 00:19:37,820
Yeah.

364
00:19:37,820 --> 00:19:38,820
Well, and hopefully it'll only feel like one.

365
00:19:38,820 --> 00:19:39,820
Yeah.

366
00:19:39,820 --> 00:19:40,820
Five damage.

367
00:19:40,820 --> 00:19:41,820
You take it.

368
00:19:41,820 --> 00:19:42,820
Yeah.

369
00:19:42,820 --> 00:19:43,820
I'm going to take it.

370
00:19:43,820 --> 00:19:44,820
I'm going to take it.

371
00:19:44,820 --> 00:19:45,820
I'm going to take it.

372
00:19:45,820 --> 00:19:46,820
I'm going to take it.

373
00:19:46,820 --> 00:19:47,820
I'm going to take it.

374
00:19:47,820 --> 00:19:48,820
I'm going to take it.

375
00:19:48,820 --> 00:19:49,820
I'm going to take it.

376
00:19:49,820 --> 00:19:53,660
you take. Okay. And then it's gonna mosquito bite that takes

377
00:19:53,660 --> 00:20:03,660
30% of my entire life. Yeah and then it's going to attack you

378
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:08,700
again with the clack. It's gonna try to clack at you again.

379
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:14,700
Okay. Let's see what this does. Yeah. No, it got a crit one. So

380
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:20,380
just like tries to get it your wooden nose form and it like

381
00:20:20,380 --> 00:20:24,780
gets stuck in it for a little bit and starts to roll with you

382
00:20:24,780 --> 00:20:28,380
and just like sort of shakes off and shakes off and

383
00:20:28,380 --> 00:20:32,140
stops doing that. John Candy.

384
00:20:32,140 --> 00:20:37,420
Because I've been crying so much because of how inspired I was by the song.

385
00:20:37,420 --> 00:20:41,660
Yeah. I don't do it, you know.

386
00:20:41,660 --> 00:20:43,900
(laughter)

387
00:20:43,900 --> 00:20:53,860

00:20:56,900 --> 00:21:00,140
- Yeah, there's a lot of turd devils or?

391
00:21:00,140 --> 00:21:02,200

392
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:04,980
- There any more turd devils?

393
00:21:04,980 --> 00:21:06,060
- That are alive?

394
00:21:06,060 --> 00:21:06,900
- Yeah.

395
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:09,660
- Right, there's one that you're fighting right now.

396
00:21:09,660 --> 00:21:11,220
- Oh, it's fighting me?

397
00:21:11,220 --> 00:21:12,620
Well, it's fighting everyone.

398
00:21:12,620 --> 00:21:15,020
I just grab how close it is to me.

399
00:21:15,020 --> 00:21:17,220
You can get over there at this point.

400
00:21:17,220 --> 00:21:18,620
You're close enough to this guy.

401
00:21:18,620 --> 00:21:22,920
Okay, I'm going to I hear him because he just hit Caleb,

402
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:23,420

403
00:21:23,420 --> 00:21:26,820
So I hear him being loud.

404
00:21:26,820 --> 00:21:33,020
And I go over to him and I just like grab pick him up and

405
00:21:33,020 --> 00:21:35,520
start shaking him and is like don't you fucking hear that

406
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:38,820
song that you pick up the turd devil.

407
00:21:38,820 --> 00:21:40,320
Yeah, they're great.

408
00:21:40,420 --> 00:21:45,620
I'm reprimanding him for not listening to the most beautiful song I've ever heard.

409
00:21:45,620 --> 00:21:48,140
So you're gonna grapple him I guess.

410
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:50,540
So oh, are you attacking him?

411
00:21:50,540 --> 00:21:52,660
Oh shit, you're hitting him?

412
00:21:52,660 --> 00:21:55,860
Well I mean I'm in a rage and I also can't control myself.

413
00:21:55,860 --> 00:21:59,020
Okay, oh you're just gonna do an unarmed strike.

414
00:21:59,020 --> 00:22:01,700
You're just grabbing him and like throttling his neck.

415
00:22:01,700 --> 00:22:02,700
Yeah.

416
00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:03,700
Alright yeah, roll for damage.

417
00:22:03,700 --> 00:22:04,700
That does hit him.

418
00:22:04,700 --> 00:22:05,700
Four.

419
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:10,020
Okay, yeah, you just almost kill him.

420
00:22:10,020 --> 00:22:12,780
You choke almost all the life out of this guy.

421
00:22:12,780 --> 00:22:14,780
Oh wait, shit, we add two to that.

422
00:22:14,780 --> 00:22:16,780
How do you kill him?

423
00:22:16,780 --> 00:22:21,980
I'm grabbing the turdevil by the neck and I'm like, "LIZARD, I'M FUCKING SORRY!"

424
00:22:21,980 --> 00:22:29,700
And then I just snap the neck completely off of its body immediately and then the devil

425
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:34,860
head pops up and just grabs that by the neck too and do the same thing.

426
00:22:34,860 --> 00:22:39,060
Yeah, you guys have defeated the turd devils.

427
00:22:39,060 --> 00:22:43,060
Um, uh, and yeah, that's great.

428
00:22:43,060 --> 00:22:47,060
You see a lady dibby comes out and uh, um, wank off.

429
00:22:47,060 --> 00:22:50,760
Um, and lady dibby says, this is wonderful.

430
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:52,460
You've taken care of the two devils for me.

431
00:22:52,460 --> 00:22:52,960
Thank you.

432
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:54,460
Yeah, I did it all by myself.

433
00:22:54,460 --> 00:22:57,260
No, I I was watching the fight.

434
00:22:57,260 --> 00:22:58,860
I know you did a very good job.

435
00:22:58,860 --> 00:23:01,460
I did the best job.

436
00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:09,400
And she sort of looks at you three and she says, if I say, should I say yes here?

437
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:19,080
You're all sort of varying levels of uselessness.

438
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:21,000
I'm waving at her right now.

439
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:27,400
I'm waving like she's like behind a mirror or behind a window.

440
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:31,720
And I'm just like, I'm waving at her like she's behind a mirror.

441
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:38,280
I somehow have gotten I'm somehow on my back flat and the weight of my nose is just slowly

442
00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:40,720
just crushing my own face.

443
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:43,120
Completely flat.

444
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:48,600
I have not much to respond right now.

445
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:51,560
Okay, we'll let's you know what?

446
00:23:51,560 --> 00:23:56,320
Let's address that now.

447
00:23:56,320 --> 00:24:07,240
So, Pinocchio, as you're getting crushed, your nose starts to change a little bit more.

448
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:10,560
It starts to crush into you, this part of your body.

449
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:15,360
And to the point where it's crushing down into your face, crushing down into your body,

450
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:21,680
and now you have these two legs that are just coming out, and just this pillar for a body.

451
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:26,300
And you start, your eyes start to pop up from the top of this pillar.

452
00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:28,220
And a mouth slit starts to form.

453
00:24:28,220 --> 00:24:31,620
You're making me go fuckin' Thomas the Tank Engine now?

454
00:24:31,620 --> 00:24:33,020
You're becoming a tree.

455
00:24:33,020 --> 00:24:34,020
Oh wow.

456
00:24:34,020 --> 00:24:35,520
You're too, okay.

457
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:42,240
I have a new character to assign you.

458
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:47,460
Because I can't possibly allow you to be that big and different without you getting a whole

459
00:24:47,460 --> 00:24:48,460
new character.

460
00:24:48,460 --> 00:24:49,460
So I'm gonna assign this to you.

461
00:24:49,460 --> 00:24:50,460
Because I've evolved.

462
00:24:50,460 --> 00:24:56,700
Pokevolved, your new Pinocchio, as far as I'm concerned, you can call yourself, I don't know,

463
00:24:56,700 --> 00:25:02,300
whatever you want, Bill Hickory, if you're doing the comedian thing. I don't know.

464
00:25:02,300 --> 00:25:05,020
That's all you had. Just don't.

465
00:25:05,020 --> 00:25:11,980
I was thinking about that the other day and I was like, that's kind of funny. And I couldn't

466
00:25:11,980 --> 00:25:17,020
think of anything else. I couldn't think of any other comedian tree puns. Spruce Spruce.

467
00:25:18,220 --> 00:25:19,220
I don't know, Lenny Spruce.

468
00:25:19,220 --> 00:25:20,220
How about, how about, how about like a...

469
00:25:20,220 --> 00:25:22,220
That was a, that was good.

470
00:25:22,220 --> 00:25:24,220
Yeah, it was very good.

471
00:25:24,220 --> 00:25:25,220
That was good.

472
00:25:25,220 --> 00:25:31,220
How about like a, uh, like Red Fox, like giant, like giant red fox.

473
00:25:31,220 --> 00:25:32,220
Redwood Fox.

474
00:25:32,220 --> 00:25:36,220
Redwood Fox is what I meant to say, basically.

475
00:25:36,220 --> 00:25:38,220
Yeah, Redwood Fox.

476
00:25:38,220 --> 00:25:39,220
Yeah, you're Redwood Fox.

477
00:25:39,220 --> 00:25:41,220
Okay, well, I can't wait to hear that voice.

478
00:25:41,220 --> 00:25:42,220
So, let me...

479
00:25:42,220 --> 00:25:43,220
Okay.

480
00:25:43,220 --> 00:25:48,220
But he has my normal voice so that I can stop getting confused with Bibi.

481
00:25:48,220 --> 00:25:51,220
Alright, so click on this link I sent you.

482
00:25:51,220 --> 00:25:54,220
Alright. Whoa. More HP.

483
00:25:54,220 --> 00:26:01,220
Yep, you have more HP, lower AC, you're some kind of tree, deformed tree man now.

484
00:26:01,220 --> 00:26:07,220
Um, uh, when you lie, we'll see what happens.

485
00:26:07,220 --> 00:26:09,220
Um, and yeah.

486
00:26:09,220 --> 00:26:14,020
And yeah, it's pretty soon because I'm curious. Yeah. Okay.

487
00:26:14,020 --> 00:26:19,060
Yeah. And so that just like happens in front of everybody

488
00:26:19,060 --> 00:26:24,100
it's horrific by the way you see my my arms. Okay. So yeah,

489
00:26:24,100 --> 00:26:27,860
so I'm I'm sitting there the last thing the last time that

490
00:26:27,860 --> 00:26:32,340
I'm recognizable as Pinocchio. I have this giant tree trunk

491
00:26:32,340 --> 00:26:37,780
just just crushing my head and you see the wood around my my

492
00:26:37,780 --> 00:26:42,660
face start to splinter and crack and then at some point it just

493
00:26:42,660 --> 00:26:47,140
bursts and then the tree the the trunk hits the ground roots

494
00:26:47,140 --> 00:26:52,260
shoot out of it. Yes. And those are my new legs. Yes. and then

495
00:26:52,260 --> 00:26:57,140
it just slowly like it grows maybe another five feet or so

496
00:26:57,140 --> 00:27:02,660
tall and just drags the lifeless boy body with it kind

497
00:27:02,660 --> 00:27:06,020
of it's like it's wearing it as a cape at this point and then

498
00:27:06,020 --> 00:27:08,860
my eyes pop out, my mouth pops out.

499
00:27:08,860 --> 00:27:11,520
I say, "Hey, everybody."

500
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:14,100
(all laughing)

501
00:27:14,100 --> 00:27:15,900
- What's the--

502
00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:18,460
- I feel a lot better now and taller.

503
00:27:18,460 --> 00:27:20,580
- Was that puberty?

504
00:27:20,580 --> 00:27:21,420
What was that?

505
00:27:21,420 --> 00:27:24,060
What did I, what was that?

506
00:27:24,060 --> 00:27:26,680
- I'm not even gonna try to begin to explain

507
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:30,220
or pretend that I know what just happened to me.

508
00:27:30,220 --> 00:27:33,340
- I hope that happens to me someday.

509
00:27:33,340 --> 00:27:34,460
- You know, probably more likely,

510
00:27:34,460 --> 00:27:36,660
I'm going to fall on you pretty soon.

511
00:27:36,660 --> 00:27:39,580
Yeah, I'm already I'm trying to climb.

512
00:27:39,580 --> 00:27:43,860
Pinocchio or I guess what?

513
00:27:43,860 --> 00:27:44,740
What are we going with?

514
00:27:44,740 --> 00:27:47,220
Redwood Redwood Fox Redwood Fox.

515
00:27:47,220 --> 00:27:48,860
I'm climbing Redwood Fox.

516
00:27:48,860 --> 00:27:52,060
Yeah.

517
00:27:52,060 --> 00:27:53,660
So.

518
00:27:53,660 --> 00:27:59,940
Cool, she says Lady Debbie says.

519
00:27:59,940 --> 00:28:02,460
There was the weak point.

520
00:28:02,460 --> 00:28:03,660
The pipe is just this way and

521
00:28:03,660 --> 00:28:07,300
She leads you a bit more down this sort of sludge toilet,

522
00:28:07,300 --> 00:28:09,960
both piping and also showroom for toilets.

523
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:13,780
You find sort of a weaker area of the pipe.

524
00:28:13,780 --> 00:28:15,460
And she says, "In there,

525
00:28:15,460 --> 00:28:17,060
we'll lead you to the bombs room.

526
00:28:17,060 --> 00:28:21,060
So just be careful going down."

527
00:28:21,060 --> 00:28:25,140
- Are you telling me to be careful specifically?

528
00:28:25,140 --> 00:28:25,980
- Yeah, yeah.

529
00:28:25,980 --> 00:28:29,100
Yes.

530
00:28:29,100 --> 00:28:29,940
(laughing)

531
00:28:29,940 --> 00:28:31,540
- I'll be very careful.

532
00:28:31,540 --> 00:28:39,700
I'm I'm instantly I'm flying across the room hitting walls. I'm ricocheting off of stuff. I'm yeah, of course. Yeah

533
00:28:39,700 --> 00:28:43,560
So yeah, you guys want to break through that pipe?

534
00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:48,580
You can do some attacks on it to break it open or we can just use I guess you could just use some

535
00:28:48,580 --> 00:28:52,880
Pinocchio or red redwood Fox as a battering ram also

536
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:55,800
Let's do it. Yeah

537
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:59,860
Yeah, you gotta now go ahead pick me up

538
00:28:59,860 --> 00:29:04,860
I decided to do the voice now.

539
00:29:04,860 --> 00:29:05,860
Fuck yes.

540
00:29:05,860 --> 00:29:07,860
Okay, yeah, you're picked up.

541
00:29:07,860 --> 00:29:10,860
Why does he sound like Louis Armstrong?

542
00:29:10,860 --> 00:29:13,860
That's what Red Fox sounded like, bro.

543
00:29:13,860 --> 00:29:14,860
No.

544
00:29:14,860 --> 00:29:16,860
Go watch a Red Fox video right now.

545
00:29:16,860 --> 00:29:17,860
Okay.

546
00:29:17,860 --> 00:29:19,860
Don't watch a Red Fox video.

547
00:29:19,860 --> 00:29:21,860
Just like that.

548
00:29:21,860 --> 00:29:25,860
It also sounds like a big tree, so I think that's a good voice.

549
00:29:25,860 --> 00:29:26,860
Yeah.

550
00:29:26,860 --> 00:29:30,220
Yeah, Pat's gonna watch a Red Fox video.

551
00:29:30,220 --> 00:29:33,220
I see the lights.

552
00:29:33,220 --> 00:29:37,540
This guy was pretty funny.

553
00:29:37,540 --> 00:29:40,740
He was very funny. You were one second into the video.

554
00:29:40,740 --> 00:29:44,180
Yeah, look what he's doing.

555
00:29:44,180 --> 00:29:47,540
Check this video out, he's so funny.

556
00:29:47,540 --> 00:29:51,300
Keep this in. Let's see what the video. Let's see what this video is.

557
00:29:51,300 --> 00:29:55,180
Oh, that's funny.

558
00:29:55,180 --> 00:29:56,180
All right.

559
00:29:56,180 --> 00:29:57,180
That's pretty funny.

560
00:29:57,180 --> 00:29:58,180
That's pretty funny.

561
00:29:58,180 --> 00:30:02,220
Red Fox hilariously pounces headfirst to the snow from the Smithsonian channel.

562
00:30:02,220 --> 00:30:05,740
Does that mean that you search Red Fox hilarious?

563
00:30:05,740 --> 00:30:16,300
That's how Matt gets a lay of any stand up comedians.

564
00:30:16,300 --> 00:30:19,220
There's just their name plus hilarious.

565
00:30:19,220 --> 00:30:20,220
Any good?

566
00:30:20,220 --> 00:30:21,220
Most hilarious clip.

567
00:30:21,220 --> 00:30:25,100
You don't want like their serious moment on Marin where they talk about their divorce.

568
00:30:25,100 --> 00:30:27,700
No, not at all. I don't want to hear that bullshit.

569
00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:29,100
To the point, it's funny.

570
00:30:29,100 --> 00:30:32,100
Remember when Redd Foxx went on Bandit and talked about his divorce?

571
00:30:32,100 --> 00:30:34,600
[Laughter]

572
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:37,900
I type in the comedian's name and then pounce his head first into snow.

573
00:30:37,900 --> 00:30:39,900
So I also got this video.

574
00:30:39,900 --> 00:30:40,900
They all do it.

575
00:30:40,900 --> 00:30:42,900
Yeah, you gotta do it once.

576
00:30:42,900 --> 00:30:44,900
Oh man, okay.

577
00:30:44,900 --> 00:30:48,400
So yeah, you use Redd Foxx as a battery grab.

578
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:52,400
And you bust through this pipe.

579
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:57,080
and sort of slide out and sort of sludge and gunk comes out after you and you slide out

580
00:30:57,080 --> 00:31:00,440
into this beautiful like the opposite looking place.

581
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:07,220
Beautiful pristine room with all these like bombs of different kinds in like glass cases

582
00:31:07,220 --> 00:31:11,560
that are being protected on you see frogs and robots and lab coats working on these

583
00:31:11,560 --> 00:31:12,560
bombs.

584
00:31:12,560 --> 00:31:16,160
Um, Wankoff sort of dusts himself off.

585
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:21,280
Um, and he says, uh, uh, uh, this is okay.

586
00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:23,000
So this room I'm in all the time.

587
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:27,200
All right, this is kind of, you know, this is where the real money comes from, to be

588
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:28,200
honest.

589
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:29,340
You know, I got to make sure it's in tip top shape.

590
00:31:29,340 --> 00:31:32,520
Got government guys coming in, always buying shit from me.

591
00:31:32,520 --> 00:31:35,160
So this room I could tell you guys about.

592
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:36,960
We got tons of bombs in here.

593
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:38,520
We're working day in, day out.

594
00:31:38,520 --> 00:31:43,240
We got H bombs, C4, C5, C6, nail bombs.

595
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:47,280
We got the Moab, the Foab, the Goab, the Doab, the Shlomoab.

596
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:48,480
We got it all.

597
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:53,520
So yeah, there's not really anything we have to do in here.

598
00:31:53,520 --> 00:31:56,240
We just have to get to the control room, I guess, and unclog the toilet.

599
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:57,240
That'll be great.

600
00:31:57,240 --> 00:32:09,080
Well, okay, I'll just walk a straight line through this room.

601
00:32:09,080 --> 00:32:14,360
I'm like, yeah, I'm falling one way coming so close to like a glass case with a bomb

602
00:32:14,360 --> 00:32:15,360
in it.

603
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:20,480
disrespect should we moisty kill Bibby?

604
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:24,800
Moisty kill.

605
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:30,560
I'm frankly not against it at this point but maybe we could just tie him to the tree guy.

606
00:32:30,560 --> 00:32:32,560
Oh boy!

607
00:32:32,560 --> 00:32:34,560
Oh boy!

608
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:36,560
Hell no!

609
00:32:36,560 --> 00:32:44,760
We try to put Bibby up on one of his branches and it immediately snaps.

610
00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:45,760
That hurts me.

611
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:46,760
Okay.

612
00:32:46,760 --> 00:32:52,000
Okay, look, uh, baby, like, uh, wait, you, you've got a belt still, right?

613
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,520
Do you have another belt?

614
00:32:54,520 --> 00:32:55,520
John.

615
00:32:55,520 --> 00:32:56,520
John.

616
00:32:56,520 --> 00:32:57,520
What?

617
00:32:57,520 --> 00:32:58,520
Fuck, dude.

618
00:32:58,520 --> 00:32:59,520
Oh my God.

619
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:06,320
I don't have to deal with this bullshit right now.

620
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:09,440
Do you have a spare belt or can we just use your belt just while we're-

621
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:10,440
I have a shoelace.

622
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:13,440
Okay, you know what, fine.

623
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:17,840
Okay, and so yeah, they're just tying your shoelace as a belt.

624
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:21,940
You tying the shoelaces your crutches together, baby.

625
00:33:21,940 --> 00:33:28,040
So you're just sort of like a slug on the ground now and yeah,

626
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:31,340
wake up goes but my favorite bomb by the way, and he snaps

627
00:33:31,340 --> 00:33:35,340
his fingers and you see a robot come out and lift up lift up

628
00:33:35,340 --> 00:33:41,640
in a bomb and it looks this like beautiful like like orb.

629
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:45,960
It looks almost like a little glass orb that has like this swirling pink mist in it.

630
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:49,120
Similar to the mist you saw outside the factory.

631
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:54,360
Because this is my candy dream bomb.

632
00:33:54,360 --> 00:33:55,920
Can I touch it?

633
00:33:55,920 --> 00:34:00,160
Yeah, well, I just rolled a sling attack

634
00:34:00,160 --> 00:34:04,480
because I accidentally just shot a tube out of my sling.

635
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:07,240
OK, hit the ball.

636
00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:10,240
Oh, my God. OK, that does hit the bomb.

637
00:34:10,240 --> 00:34:14,240
Uh, okay, the bomb goes off.

638
00:34:14,240 --> 00:34:18,240
I mean...

639
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:22,240
Uh, okay, and uh, uh,

640
00:34:22,240 --> 00:34:26,240
Wankoff is like, "Oh no, what the fuck, no! Everyone hold your nose!"

641
00:34:26,240 --> 00:34:30,240
Um, I mean, there's no way, you're not prepared for this.

642
00:34:30,240 --> 00:34:34,240
Okay, uh, "I-I think I am a nose!"

643
00:34:34,240 --> 00:34:38,240
"Still not sure!"

644
00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:45,460
fucking shit. So this sleepy pink fog sort of starts to billow out of the bomb and you

645
00:34:45,460 --> 00:34:57,240
all sort of drift off into sleep. You hear chimes playing, you know the ones. And you're

646
00:34:57,240 --> 00:35:06,420
in the candy dream zone. All each of you. Are you for real? Yeah, each of you. Oh my

647
00:35:06,420 --> 00:35:08,420
My God, did I just go to heaven?

648
00:35:08,420 --> 00:35:11,520
Yes, in a way.

649
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:14,220
Each of you right now are in your own.

650
00:35:14,220 --> 00:35:15,420
Well, they got dead.

651
00:35:15,420 --> 00:35:15,820
Don't worry.

652
00:35:15,820 --> 00:35:16,120
Okay.

653
00:35:16,120 --> 00:35:16,520
Each of you.

654
00:35:16,520 --> 00:35:17,220
Well, but.

655
00:35:17,220 --> 00:35:20,020
This doesn't look anything like the heaven I've seen.

656
00:35:20,020 --> 00:35:29,020
Each of you are in your own sort of separate personal

657
00:35:29,020 --> 00:35:30,520
candy dream zones.

658
00:35:30,520 --> 00:35:32,820
You're not aware of one another.

659
00:35:32,820 --> 00:35:34,120
You're probably not even aware of it.

660
00:35:34,120 --> 00:35:38,600
you're in the candy dream sound to be honest. You're each experiencing

661
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:43,720
something specific to your character which I want to talk through with you.

662
00:35:43,720 --> 00:35:50,040

00:38:24,580 --> 00:38:25,580
So.

686
00:38:25,580 --> 00:38:26,580
No!

687
00:38:26,580 --> 00:38:31,940
Uh, now, and uh, Wankoff's is somewhere having his.

688
00:38:31,940 --> 00:38:34,180
But you guys don't have any view into that.

689
00:38:34,180 --> 00:38:35,180
What?

690
00:38:35,180 --> 00:38:36,180
Well you don't.

691
00:38:36,180 --> 00:38:38,460
Everyone else got to see mine.

692
00:38:38,460 --> 00:38:43,980
Well, yeah but Wankoff is, is, you know, that's you guys telling the audience.

693
00:38:43,980 --> 00:38:45,900
Okay, you all take-

694
00:38:45,900 --> 00:38:47,260
I'm sick of you.

695
00:38:47,260 --> 00:38:48,860
You're not the first.

696
00:38:48,860 --> 00:38:50,860
You all take 2 damage.

697
00:38:50,860 --> 00:38:51,860
Okay.

698
00:38:51,860 --> 00:38:55,220
Well I have 30, I'm at full health.

699
00:38:55,220 --> 00:38:57,660
So I don't care.

700
00:38:57,660 --> 00:38:58,660
Okay.

701
00:38:58,660 --> 00:38:59,660
Now, Bibby.

702
00:38:59,660 --> 00:39:03,380
You're dancing with the cars, you take this bit of damage.

703
00:39:03,380 --> 00:39:05,500
Roll a wisdom saving throw.

704
00:39:05,500 --> 00:39:06,940
Okay.

705
00:39:06,940 --> 00:39:07,940
That is a 15.

706
00:39:07,940 --> 00:39:08,940
Wow, holy shit.

707
00:39:08,940 --> 00:39:12,420
Okay, that's exactly it.

708
00:39:12,420 --> 00:39:15,220
As you're dancing with the cars, you're holding onto their wheels, dancing.

709
00:39:15,220 --> 00:39:17,620
What are the trains, what are all the vehicles doing?

710
00:39:17,620 --> 00:39:22,740
What's the plane doing? Is the plane doing like a left shark kind of dance?

711
00:39:22,740 --> 00:39:28,500
Yeah, the train is doing like a chugga chugga choo choo kind of dance like a little boogie.

712
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:32,020
Yeah, the car is doing the whip and the nay nay.

713
00:39:32,020 --> 00:39:35,540
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

714
00:39:35,540 --> 00:39:37,300
No cars.

715
00:39:37,300 --> 00:39:43,060
Doing that. The boat is doing the hula.

716
00:39:43,060 --> 00:39:47,940
Because it's kind of like a wave. Yeah, another vehicle, a bike, the bike is pedaling. That's

717
00:39:47,940 --> 00:39:52,420
all it can do. Yeah, pathetic. Can't really dance. Well, it's been the handlebars.

718
00:39:52,420 --> 00:39:57,380
It's doing the handlebars too. That's a good point. It is actually doing that.

719
00:39:57,380 --> 00:40:01,300
But the skateboard is just covered in shit and not moving anywhere.

720
00:40:01,300 --> 00:40:05,620
That's right. Even Bibi doesn't want to be friends with a skateboard. It's filthy.

721
00:40:05,620 --> 00:40:07,300
Yeah. True.

722
00:40:07,300 --> 00:40:10,340
Seems messed up for you to say that.

723
00:40:11,460 --> 00:40:13,940
Not me, it's Bibby, so you can't get mad at me.

724
00:40:13,940 --> 00:40:16,100
It seems stupid too.

725
00:40:16,100 --> 00:40:21,620
I'm doing a Congo line with all of them now.

726
00:40:21,620 --> 00:40:24,660
While you're in the middle of this Congo line with all these different vehicles,

727
00:40:24,660 --> 00:40:35,780
cool, you're holding on to the "hips" of a car or the shoulders area. Either way,

728
00:40:36,340 --> 00:40:40,420
You're touching near the door of a car and with that,

729
00:40:40,420 --> 00:40:42,140
we take a bit of damage.

730
00:40:42,140 --> 00:40:43,420
You don't know what that damage is.

731
00:40:43,420 --> 00:40:46,300
You just feel a certain amount of pain and confusion.

732
00:40:46,300 --> 00:40:48,500
If you're so slipping more into this dream zone.

733
00:40:48,500 --> 00:40:53,140
But then when you have that, you have that wisdom saving

734
00:40:53,140 --> 00:40:57,780
there with that score, you start to realize that this isn't real.

735
00:40:57,780 --> 00:41:02,580
And as you're slowly starting to realize it, the car door starts to open up

736
00:41:02,580 --> 00:41:06,980
and slam on your hands just over and over and over.

737
00:41:06,980 --> 00:41:07,980
Yippee!

738
00:41:07,980 --> 00:41:14,060
And so we're going to go back to you.

739
00:41:14,060 --> 00:41:20,460
You Red Foxwood, Roll Wisdom Saving Throw.

740
00:41:20,460 --> 00:41:22,020
Eight.

741
00:41:22,020 --> 00:41:23,020
Yeah.

742
00:41:23,020 --> 00:41:25,580
You are still crushing it in your routine.

743
00:41:25,580 --> 00:41:27,580
You are still nailing this.

744
00:41:27,580 --> 00:41:29,340
You're doing so well.

745
00:41:29,340 --> 00:41:33,140
You can see in the back it's spud apatow.

746
00:41:33,140 --> 00:41:35,100
Is spud a kind of thing?

747
00:41:35,100 --> 00:41:36,100
It's not.

748
00:41:36,100 --> 00:41:37,100
It's shrub apatow.

749
00:41:37,100 --> 00:41:38,460
What was I trying to shrub apatow?

750
00:41:38,460 --> 00:41:39,460
Thank you.

751
00:41:39,460 --> 00:41:40,460
That's pretty good.

752
00:41:40,460 --> 00:41:41,940
I think either one of those are probably fine.

753
00:41:41,940 --> 00:41:42,940
Right?

754
00:41:42,940 --> 00:41:43,940
Yeah.

755
00:41:43,940 --> 00:41:44,940
I'm with him.

756
00:41:44,940 --> 00:41:46,940
It's just a bush and he's just a he's sort of like.

757
00:41:46,940 --> 00:41:47,940
Birch!

758
00:41:47,940 --> 00:41:48,940
Cherry!

759
00:41:48,940 --> 00:41:52,780
This guy's good I'm telling you.

760
00:41:52,780 --> 00:41:53,780
What do you think Seth?

761
00:41:53,780 --> 00:41:54,780
And Seth is smoking the.

762
00:41:54,780 --> 00:41:55,780

763
00:41:55,780 --> 00:42:04,660
And Waylon roll wisdom saving throw.

764

00:42:05,660 --> 00:42:06,660
Oh yeah.

766
00:42:06,660 --> 00:42:07,660
What do we got?

767
00:42:07,660 --> 00:42:08,660
This is annoying that there we go.

768
00:42:08,660 --> 00:42:17,540
It's going to be a six.

769
00:42:17,540 --> 00:42:20,060
Yeah, you're none the wiser.

770
00:42:20,060 --> 00:42:22,820
You're just enjoying this, this case.

771
00:42:22,820 --> 00:42:25,180
You have another case coming up.

772
00:42:25,180 --> 00:42:33,620
see that the defendant in this case is your father who would not let you sit in the front

773
00:42:33,620 --> 00:42:36,300
seat because you're too small.

774
00:42:36,300 --> 00:42:40,180
And you have such a great case against him.

775
00:42:40,180 --> 00:42:42,740
That's what you get for trying to protect me.

776
00:42:42,740 --> 00:42:47,300
Son, I didn't want to let you sit up front.

777
00:42:47,300 --> 00:42:48,860
You're such a smart young man.

778
00:42:48,860 --> 00:42:50,980
I wanted you to be a terrific lawyer.

779
00:42:50,980 --> 00:42:52,220
I don't want you to get hurt.

780
00:42:52,220 --> 00:42:55,580
Well, you should have thought about that before you put my car seat in the back

781
00:42:55,580 --> 00:43:04,220
Where so I can see all the comings and goings of our journey, where did I go wrong and

Oh my god dude what the fuck is there no end to this.

795
00:44:04,460 --> 00:44:08,460
You just have to roll a 15 like me.

796
00:44:08,460 --> 00:44:12,460
Also my my role or my d&d beyond damage thing is not working.

797
00:44:12,460 --> 00:44:17,260
It won't let me add damage for some reason.

798
00:44:17,260 --> 00:44:20,060
I guess you're stuck at full HP.

799
00:44:20,060 --> 00:44:21,060
Uh oh.

800
00:44:21,060 --> 00:44:22,060
That sucks.

801
00:44:22,060 --> 00:44:23,060
Wow.

802
00:44:23,060 --> 00:44:27,060
Would you just take 6 total, right?

803
00:44:27,060 --> 00:44:28,060
5 total.

804
00:44:28,060 --> 00:44:31,060
I think it was 2 the first time.

805
00:44:31,060 --> 00:44:32,060
Oh, okay.

806
00:44:32,060 --> 00:44:33,060
So I'm at 15.

807
00:44:33,060 --> 00:44:34,060
Or no.

808
00:44:34,060 --> 00:44:35,060
16, I got you.

809
00:44:35,060 --> 00:44:36,060
What is my HP?

810
00:44:36,060 --> 00:44:37,060
21.

811
00:44:37,060 --> 00:44:43,860
So, Bibby, you now know this isn't a dream.

812
00:44:43,860 --> 00:44:48,820
This is the candy dream zone.

813
00:44:48,820 --> 00:44:55,140
All the vehicles are now gunning to attack you.

814
00:44:55,140 --> 00:44:59,860
You can try to fight them for sure.

815
00:44:59,860 --> 00:45:03,700
But you also now get the sense that all your friends are also in this dream zone.

816
00:45:03,700 --> 00:45:04,700
Yeah.

817
00:45:04,700 --> 00:45:06,100
You can try to find them as well.

818
00:45:06,100 --> 00:45:10,740
I'm going to try and like, I don't know if they're your friends.

819
00:45:10,740 --> 00:45:15,540
This is a first. This is something I would never attempt in real life, but I am going

820
00:45:15,540 --> 00:45:19,540
to in in in real in the in Bibby's real life.

821
00:45:19,540 --> 00:45:20,540
Okay, okay.

822
00:45:20,540 --> 00:45:23,540
This is something Bibby would never attempt.

823
00:45:23,540 --> 00:45:27,540
Everything else I've been doing.

824
00:45:27,540 --> 00:45:32,860
Bibby would never do this. He's going to try to get into the car, into the driver's seat

825
00:45:32,860 --> 00:45:33,860
of the car.

826
00:45:33,860 --> 00:45:34,860
Holy shit.

827
00:45:34,860 --> 00:45:35,860
Wow.

828
00:45:35,860 --> 00:45:36,860
Huge, yeah. Big step.

829
00:45:36,860 --> 00:45:38,560
Does not have a license, no.

830
00:45:38,560 --> 00:45:39,560
Definitely not.

831
00:45:39,560 --> 00:45:40,560
Oh, okay.

832
00:45:40,560 --> 00:45:41,560
Um, yeah, do it.

833
00:45:41,560 --> 00:45:42,560
Yeah.

834
00:45:42,560 --> 00:45:43,560
Okay.

835
00:45:43,560 --> 00:45:44,560
All right.

836
00:45:44,560 --> 00:45:47,560
I'm, yeah, I'm, I'm trying to get behind the wheel.

837
00:45:47,560 --> 00:45:50,240
Actually fuck it a train, not a car.

838
00:45:50,240 --> 00:45:51,240
Hell yes.

839
00:45:51,240 --> 00:45:52,240
Okay.

840
00:45:52,240 --> 00:45:53,240
You go inside the train.

841
00:45:53,240 --> 00:45:55,280
Uh, yeah, you can, you can power this train.

842
00:45:55,280 --> 00:45:56,280
This is your dream.

843
00:45:56,280 --> 00:46:01,160
Wait, what does, what does Bibi think the inside of it?

844
00:46:01,160 --> 00:46:02,160
Yes.

845
00:46:02,160 --> 00:46:04,160
*laughter*

846
00:46:04,160 --> 00:46:06,160
*laughter*

847
00:46:06,160 --> 00:46:08,160

*laughter*

850
00:46:12,160 --> 00:46:14,160
*laughter*

851
00:46:14,160 --> 00:46:16,160
*laughter*

852
00:46:16,160 --> 00:46:18,160
*laughter*

853
00:46:18,160 --> 00:46:20,160
*laughter*

854
00:46:20,160 --> 00:46:22,160
*laughter*

855
00:46:22,160 --> 00:46:24,160
*laughter*

856
00:46:24,160 --> 00:46:26,160
*laughter*

857
00:46:26,160 --> 00:46:28,160
*laughter*

858
00:46:28,160 --> 00:46:30,160
*laughter*

859
00:46:30,160 --> 00:46:31,160
*laughter*

860
00:46:31,160 --> 00:46:33,160
Okay, yeah, you're steering the train.

00:46:52,160 --> 00:46:55,160
You're not really able to control the train that well,

872
00:46:55,160 --> 00:46:59,160
but you are able to, like, crash it through one of the walls a little bit.

00:50:48,100 --> 00:50:49,100
All right, Bibby, it's your time.

00:50:58,100 --> 00:50:59,100

00:51:00,460 --> 00:51:02,460
13 yeah, you crash through

925
00:51:02,460 --> 00:51:09,100
There is now you what you think is the woke mob redwood fox as it crashes through and they're holding their

926
00:51:09,100 --> 00:51:11,580
signs and their

927
00:51:11,580 --> 00:51:13,500
fucking pink hair

928
00:51:13,500 --> 00:51:17,420
They sort of morph into a train suddenly and when you see the crowd

929
00:51:17,420 --> 00:51:23,180
They're all staring daggers at you now and it's sort of like scanners and you realize you're not in a dream now

930
00:51:23,180 --> 00:51:27,580
Uh, this is not your stand-up routine. You don't look you look like a tree again

931
00:51:28,060 --> 00:51:30,820
You thought you were actually Red Fox for a second.

932
00:51:30,820 --> 00:51:34,020
Folks get in.

933
00:51:34,020 --> 00:51:36,560
Get in the train.

934
00:51:36,560 --> 00:51:38,800
Wow, not.

935
00:51:38,800 --> 00:51:42,960
Cheek.

936
00:51:42,960 --> 00:51:46,200
OK, all right, it's probably more than seven.

937
00:51:46,200 --> 00:51:47,720
Yeah, I feel like it's way more than seven.

938
00:51:47,720 --> 00:51:50,500
I'm dreaming.

939
00:51:50,500 --> 00:51:55,060
I jump on and I'm so large that I have to be kind of

940
00:51:55,060 --> 00:51:58,460
I jump on a like a like a like a freight train platform.

941
00:51:58,460 --> 00:51:58,960
Yes.

942
00:51:58,960 --> 00:51:59,260
Yes.

943
00:51:59,260 --> 00:52:01,460
Stick into this the smokestack on the train.

944
00:52:01,460 --> 00:52:02,460
Yeah, you plug it.

945
00:52:02,460 --> 00:52:07,260
Yeah, and the smoke is all just like filling up the inside of

946
00:52:07,260 --> 00:52:07,760
it now.

947
00:52:07,760 --> 00:52:12,660
Yeah, I'm just breathing this the train runs perfectly with

948
00:52:12,660 --> 00:52:13,760
though either way.

949
00:52:13,760 --> 00:52:18,660
Yeah, the idea of George Carlin's heaven is there's more than

950
00:52:18,660 --> 00:52:21,360
seven dirty words and he just keeps going.

951
00:52:22,760 --> 00:52:27,360
So Waylon Au Revoir, the guillotine's about to come down on your head.

952
00:52:27,360 --> 00:52:28,960
You now know that this is a dream.

953
00:52:28,960 --> 00:52:30,880
Is there anything you want to do here?

954
00:52:30,880 --> 00:52:33,200
Yeah, I say, "Aha!

955
00:52:33,200 --> 00:52:38,040
This is... you have engaged in the fallacy of ad hominem!"

956
00:52:38,040 --> 00:52:44,720
As it comes down and it chops my head off, and my head curls, and little arms and legs

957
00:52:44,720 --> 00:52:47,920
grow out of my head, and I just have a little head running around.

958
00:52:47,920 --> 00:52:51,700
as a finally of liberation myself from my body

959
00:52:51,700 --> 00:52:54,640
the what the devil

960
00:52:54,640 --> 00:52:58,160
yeah and you're running away

961
00:52:58,160 --> 00:53:02,440
a baby you're trained now which is careening through crashes through the

962
00:53:02,440 --> 00:53:03,440
courthouse

963
00:53:03,440 --> 00:53:07,040

00:53:17,400 --> 00:53:19,400
Mm-hmm. Hell yeah.

968
00:53:19,400 --> 00:53:22,400
And now we're back to you.

969
00:53:22,400 --> 00:53:24,400
Alright, so

970
00:53:24,400 --> 00:53:27,400
I want you to roll another wisdom saving throw.

971
00:53:27,400 --> 00:53:29,400

972
00:53:29,400 --> 00:53:31,400
Just to see what happens.

973
00:53:31,400 --> 00:53:33,400
17. No!

974
00:53:33,400 --> 00:53:35,400
Okay, cool. Not bad.

975
00:53:35,400 --> 00:53:37,400
So you at this point, you and your cop family

976
00:53:37,400 --> 00:53:41,400
are just roasting the convenience store guy on a spit.

977
00:53:41,400 --> 00:53:43,400
Little head, little head ass.

00:53:43,400 --> 00:53:51,400
You got a tiny head. Yeah, your head look like peanut your head like you look like peanut from Jeff Dunham big-ass ears little head

00:54:04,880 --> 00:54:11,220
He looks like peanut. I said he does all thinks you said that they look like peanut

983
00:54:11,880 --> 00:54:16,640
And they're all sort of I didn't say you guys look like peanut again John Candy

984
00:54:16,640 --> 00:54:18,480
You're starting to realize this is not a dream

985
00:54:18,480 --> 00:54:25,160
I mean this is like the family region again, but worse cuz I'm in a dream what and they're all harmed

986
00:54:25,160 --> 00:54:35,180
And now you baby you crash through this this field of cops, I'm just sprawling them out on the ground

987
00:54:37,120 --> 00:54:44,100
And John Candy you're you watch your your cop family just sort of just get just get fucking run over by this train

988
00:54:44,100 --> 00:54:47,580
But you know, it's not real or maybe you don't

989
00:54:47,580 --> 00:54:52,940
See them by the train, I'm like, all right here come on guys

990
00:54:52,940 --> 00:55:00,320
Okay, you hop on yeah you guys speed off through this dream zone

991
00:55:00,320 --> 00:55:06,260
And eventually you reach where Waylon Waylon fuck my ass

992
00:55:06,260 --> 00:55:16,260
where a wake off is and you see him and he's at Best Buy.

993
00:55:16,260 --> 00:55:32,260
He's working at Best Buy and he's 17 years old and you see a sort of a older mom starts to talk to him from behind the counter and she's like, oh Douglas, what do you want to do this year?

994
00:55:32,260 --> 00:55:38,740
year? What's the plan sort of?" He's like, "Yeah, well, I didn't do too hot in school, but I think

995
00:55:38,740 --> 00:55:43,300
if I get enough money here, maybe save up. And then I think I'm going to probably try to go to

996
00:55:43,300 --> 00:55:47,700
community college next year and then maybe do something with computers. I don't know. Maybe

997
00:55:47,700 --> 00:55:53,140
go to a four-year school after that. I think it'd be cool. But yeah, no, just trying to get myself

998
00:55:53,140 --> 00:55:58,340
sort of together. You know how it is." And she's like, "Well, I wish you best of luck on that. And

999
00:55:58,340 --> 00:56:01,540
And it was nice to see you and it was great customer service, by the way.

1000
00:56:01,540 --> 00:56:02,540
Oh, thank you.

1001
00:56:02,540 --> 00:56:03,540
Thank you.

1002
00:56:03,540 --> 00:56:08,300
And you see a manager coming from behind the Best Buy counter.

1003
00:56:08,300 --> 00:56:11,460
He says, "You're doing great, Mr. Tolberone.

1004
00:56:11,460 --> 00:56:12,460
Really good job there."

1005
00:56:12,460 --> 00:56:14,860
He says, "Oh, thanks."

1006
00:56:14,860 --> 00:56:22,820
And you see, you hear from sort of like outside of all of this, you hear, "Douglas."

1007
00:56:22,820 --> 00:56:26,980
And then we fast forward almost in time.

1008
00:56:26,980 --> 00:56:32,500
And we see Wankoff and he's in the middle of an argument with his dad.

1009
00:56:32,500 --> 00:56:37,020
His dad who doesn't look like Wankoff.

1010
00:56:37,020 --> 00:56:40,980
And you see Wankoff is yelling at his father.

1011
00:56:40,980 --> 00:56:43,380
Why did you tell me we were Wankoffs?

1012
00:56:43,380 --> 00:56:44,620
He's like, I didn't.

1013
00:56:44,620 --> 00:56:46,020
My brother is a psycho.

1014
00:56:46,020 --> 00:56:48,060
It's why I changed our name to Tolvarone.

1015
00:56:48,060 --> 00:56:49,940
I didn't want to have anything to do with them.

1016
00:56:49,940 --> 00:56:53,260
OK, just just please, like, don't listen to him.

1017
00:56:53,260 --> 00:56:55,220
I know he's offering you the factory.

1018
00:56:55,220 --> 00:56:57,140
You're on a good path here, okay?

1019
00:56:57,140 --> 00:57:00,740
Slow and steady, work hard, do something in computers.

1020
00:57:00,740 --> 00:57:01,740
You'll be good for you.

1021
00:57:01,740 --> 00:57:03,180
He's like, "No, Dad, fuck this.

1022
00:57:03,180 --> 00:57:04,180
Fuck you.

1023
00:57:04,180 --> 00:57:05,180
I can't believe you hid this from me.

1024
00:57:05,180 --> 00:57:07,680
I'm going with Uncle Wankoff."

1025
00:57:07,680 --> 00:57:12,980
And you see him and he sort of shakes himself out of his stupor and you see the Best Buy

1026
00:57:12,980 --> 00:57:17,500
backdrop and the family backdrop sort of fade away.

1027
00:57:17,500 --> 00:57:19,220
And he just sees you guys as a train.

1028
00:57:19,220 --> 00:57:22,180
He's like, "Oh.

1029
00:57:22,180 --> 00:57:23,180
What's up?

1030
00:57:23,180 --> 00:57:34,960
you you set the fucking grenade off where'd that mom go and as as you say

1031
00:57:34,960 --> 00:57:41,500
that the dream world fades away and you guys wake up on the floor of the bombs

1032
00:57:41,500 --> 00:57:49,980
the train came into the real world yeah and you wake up back in the real in the

1033
00:57:49,980 --> 00:57:57,420
real world and you see Wankoff and he's like I forgot my name was Douglas I'm

1034
00:57:57,420 --> 00:58:12,340
Douglas okay oh god uh okay let's let's get to the control room let's try to

1035
00:58:12,340 --> 00:58:19,300
unclog the toilet one of you will be my heir when this is over okay uh come on

1036
00:58:19,300 --> 00:58:29,300
Yeah, I'm following him and I have a bomb stuck to the back of my shoe like toilet paper.

1037
00:58:29,300 --> 00:58:31,300
I'm stepping right...

1038
00:58:31,300 --> 00:58:32,300
Oh my god.

1039
00:58:32,300 --> 00:58:34,300
It's dragging behind me.

1040
00:58:34,300 --> 00:58:46,300
So, yeah, you guys are now walking towards the control room and out of the bomb's room

1041
00:58:46,300 --> 00:58:50,460
where you were suffering under that strange stupor.

1042
00:58:50,460 --> 00:58:55,460
And you get to sort of a, as you leave the bombs room,

1043
00:58:55,460 --> 00:58:58,540
there's just sort of like one more like a walkway

1044
00:58:58,540 --> 00:59:00,380
that you're kind of, you're kind of above.

1045
00:59:00,380 --> 00:59:04,140
And there's a little, like a walkway that's above

1046
00:59:04,140 --> 00:59:06,780
to a larger room where there looks like

1047
00:59:06,780 --> 00:59:09,200
sort of a large gathering of the robots.

1048
00:59:09,200 --> 00:59:13,400
And you see Wankoff and he sort of looks at that

1049
00:59:13,400 --> 00:59:24,440
of peculiar peculiarly peculiarly peculiar and I can't say that word at all. And he says,

1050
00:59:24,440 --> 00:59:30,920
"That's weird. I didn't know there was a meeting today. I guess I maybe I should attend." And

1051
00:59:30,920 --> 00:59:39,000
you see the robots start to talk. There's one robot who's like sort of like on like a like on a like

1052
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:43,080
stage and sort of all these fold out chairs out with the other robots.

1053
00:59:43,080 --> 00:59:46,680
And the robot that's on the stage, Wankoff sort of gestures to him,

1054
00:59:46,680 --> 00:59:51,880
"That's the CEO bot. He's the head of the company, I guess.

1055
00:59:51,880 --> 00:59:56,080
I'm the president. He's the CEO. It's all just, you know, it doesn't mean anything."

1056
00:59:56,080 --> 01:00:02,200
And you see the robot. He goes, "First off, give yourselves a round of applause.

1057
01:00:02,200 --> 01:00:03,200
You have earned it."

1058
01:00:03,200 --> 01:00:06,600
You hear all the robots clapping like metal clanking against metal.

1059
01:00:06,600 --> 01:00:07,800
It doesn't sound very good.

1060
01:00:07,800 --> 01:00:14,120
I mean it, you guys have all been putting in 110% and it shows.

1061
01:00:14,120 --> 01:00:20,920
When I go back to my cubby to power down for the evening, I see a number of you still up, still computing.

1062
01:00:20,920 --> 01:00:27,320
Some of you have even hardwired yourselves to some of our operating systems, self-soldered to motherboards.

1063
01:00:27,320 --> 01:00:31,320
I saw one of you bleed in the crypto division after hours of mining.

1064
01:00:31,320 --> 01:00:36,440
I didn't even know we could bleed and they all kind of laugh as robots laugh.

1065
01:00:36,440 --> 01:01:04,440
But seriously, we've seen a huge increase in earnings, despite some of the, and I don't want to bullshit you guys, you know, my title is just a title. I'm always going to be real with y'all. So, despite some of the unfortunate state we've seen the place in under the nephews leadership, we've still managed to crush every quarter of the last five years. You see Wankoff kind of bristle at this.

1066
01:01:04,440 --> 01:01:10,280
We began the fiscal year projecting a market cap of 6.7 trillion. This was supposed to be our reach

1067
01:01:10,280 --> 01:01:18,360
and can I say that? Maybe I shouldn't say that. Anyway, instead we made our shareholders very,

1068
01:01:18,360 --> 01:01:23,240
very happy with a 10 trillion market capitalization, completely unheard of,

1069
01:01:23,240 --> 01:01:29,080
with a generous buy courtesy of the Brown Sticker Campaign. So thank you especially to Maria in

1070
01:01:29,080 --> 01:01:44,080
in

1071
01:01:44,080 --> 01:01:48,880
should be off the chain as well. We still have one thing left for us to do and all

1072
01:01:48,880 --> 01:01:56,800
the robots turn to the five of you. Kill the nephew and the robots start to...

1073
01:01:56,800 --> 01:02:04,400
Which one? The robots start to... I'm a nephew too! Yeah, my father has a brother.

1074
01:02:04,400 --> 01:02:09,640
There's like five nephews here I think. I don't know about that one with the crutches or

1075
01:02:09,640 --> 01:02:10,640
whatever the hell he's got.

1076
01:02:10,640 --> 01:02:15,640
I'm the furthest thing from a nephew you can possibly be!

1077
01:02:15,640 --> 01:02:19,140
I'm the furthest family member!

1078
01:02:19,140 --> 01:02:24,920
I think I might be the furthest thing from a nephew!

1079
01:02:24,920 --> 01:02:28,240
We're gonna do a d20 contest to see who is further from a nephew.

1080
01:02:28,240 --> 01:02:31,360
Bro I'm like a week old and if you fucking hit it, it's me.

1081
01:02:31,360 --> 01:02:33,360
Somebody made you, I have nobody.

1082
01:02:33,360 --> 01:02:35,120
I have no family members in the universe.

1083
01:02:35,120 --> 01:02:36,120
You exist.

1084
01:02:36,120 --> 01:02:37,120
I don't exist.

1085
01:02:37,120 --> 01:02:39,080
I got an 11.

1086
01:02:39,080 --> 01:02:44,760
are you rolling? I don't know why I'm rolling. I just rolled because I thought we were all

1087
01:02:44,760 --> 01:02:53,400
supposed to. With an 18 he's definitely closer to not to being further from a nephew so far.

1088
01:02:53,400 --> 01:03:01,160
Oh yeah it looks like the tree man is closer to being farther from a nephew

1089
01:03:01,160 --> 01:03:08,280
based on this scientific analysis. That's right. That's how we resolve conflicts.

1090
01:03:08,280 --> 01:03:10,280
Go ahead, Patches.

1091
01:03:10,280 --> 01:03:12,280
Did we get to rest or anything?

1092
01:03:12,280 --> 01:03:14,280
Because I'm at 6 HP.

1093
01:03:14,280 --> 01:03:16,280
No, you didn't.

1094
01:03:16,280 --> 01:03:18,280
Alright. Damn.

1095
01:03:18,280 --> 01:03:20,280
These robots are coming after you.

1096
01:03:20,280 --> 01:03:22,280
You see-

1097
01:03:22,280 --> 01:03:24,280
It's like an army, right?

1098
01:03:24,280 --> 01:03:26,280
Yeah, it's a lot of them. You see Wankoff goes,

1099
01:03:26,280 --> 01:03:28,280
"Okay, we gotta run to the control room!"

1100
01:03:28,280 --> 01:03:30,280
And he starts to waddle-dash

1101
01:03:30,280 --> 01:03:32,280
as fast as he can.

1102
01:03:32,280 --> 01:03:34,280
And you see, like, the robots

1103
01:03:34,280 --> 01:03:36,280
are-

1104
01:03:36,280 --> 01:03:51,720
to

1105
01:03:51,720 --> 01:04:05,600
do

1106
01:04:05,600 --> 01:04:10,100
of robots in it and then there's other floors up that have robots in them

1107
01:04:10,100 --> 01:04:14,280
including some on your walkway some of them you might be able to brush brush

1108
01:04:14,280 --> 01:04:18,800
past some of them you might have to fight yes initiative rolling is what we

1109
01:04:18,800 --> 01:04:23,720
want to do right now oh that was an ah damn I thought it was a roll to see if I

1110
01:04:23,720 --> 01:04:27,600
could dodge past all of them you know all the d20 you didn't even roll anything

1111
01:04:27,600 --> 01:04:33,960
you roll a skill you roll the d20 yeah but you didn't do anything it wasn't a

1112
01:04:33,960 --> 01:04:40,960
role

1113
01:04:40,960 --> 01:04:44,320
but uh... just the sound here is jealous

1114
01:04:44,320 --> 01:04:47,080
the one

1115
01:04:47,080 --> 01:04:51,200
you gotta one your initiative role

1116
01:04:51,200 --> 01:04:52,320
okay

1117
01:04:52,320 --> 01:04:56,240
how do i roll art can we just do you i don't know how to roll and indian d_b_i_

1118
01:04:56,240 --> 01:04:58,320
on and not you just click

1119
01:04:58,320 --> 01:04:59,580
to click initiative

1120
01:04:59,580 --> 01:05:02,080
yes the same

1121
01:05:02,080 --> 01:05:03,080
boom goes the dyno.

1122
01:05:03,080 --> 01:05:04,080
Oh, okay.

1123
01:05:04,080 --> 01:05:05,080
Does it still?

1124
01:05:05,080 --> 01:05:06,080
Okay.

1125
01:05:06,080 --> 01:05:07,080
Yeah.

1126
01:05:07,080 --> 01:05:08,080
I just don't roll 20 up.

1127
01:05:08,080 --> 01:05:11,680
Yeah, it seems like we just keep roll 20 up for whatever reason, but I think Branson,

1128
01:05:11,680 --> 01:05:16,600
you may not have to because of how we, uh, how this went down.

1129
01:05:16,600 --> 01:05:19,880
Wait, where's your, oh, that's why the download bar's in the way.

1130
01:05:19,880 --> 01:05:21,880
There we are.

1131
01:05:21,880 --> 01:05:24,640
Okay.

1132
01:05:24,640 --> 01:05:27,640
And Pat got that 20.

1133
01:05:27,640 --> 01:05:32,400
And Wankoff did not do that well, of course.

1134
01:05:32,400 --> 01:05:33,400
He's a fucking loser.

1135
01:05:33,400 --> 01:05:34,400
Whoa, come on.

1136
01:05:34,400 --> 01:05:35,400
Yeah, I made him.

1137
01:05:35,400 --> 01:05:36,400
He can do it.

1138
01:05:36,400 --> 01:05:37,400
I'm not going to role play that.

1139
01:05:37,400 --> 01:05:38,400
It's going to scare me.

1140
01:05:38,400 --> 01:05:39,400
I was like, "Oh, that'd be a fuck bit for a second."

1141
01:05:39,400 --> 01:05:40,400
I was like, "No, you'll get scared."

1142
01:05:40,400 --> 01:05:43,040
I'm not gonna roleplay that, it's gonna scare me.

1143
01:05:43,040 --> 01:05:43,540
Um...

1144
01:05:43,540 --> 01:05:45,540
[laughter]

1145
01:05:45,540 --> 01:05:47,540
I was like, "Oh, that'd be a fun bit for a second."

1146
01:05:47,540 --> 01:05:49,540
I was like, "No, you'll get scared."

1147
01:05:49,540 --> 01:06:13,540
