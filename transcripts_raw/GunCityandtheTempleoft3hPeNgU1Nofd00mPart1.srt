00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,000
[♫ "Interior" by Kool & The Gang]

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,600
Interior. Shane Dawson maximum security prison for the criminally insane.

3
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:15,600
Evening.

4
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:19,920
The scene opens on a tight close-up of a familiar face.

5
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:22,400
A Yoda who has seen better days.

6
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:26,400
Face pressed up against the unobtainium bars that keep him from escaping.

7
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:29,680
Around his head is an Adidas force suppression sweatband.

8
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:33,680
That keeps him from unleashing hell on the unsuspecting jolly bees who guard his cell.

9
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:37,180
So, um, yeah, I described you, Patrick Yoda.

10
00:00:37,180 --> 00:00:39,880
My name is Dr. Patrick Yoda.

11
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:43,680
I'm the first Yoda to ever get a degree in archaeology in prison.

12
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:46,280
I hate detective work so much.

13
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:48,580
Too much finding new dead bodies.

14
00:00:48,580 --> 00:00:50,680
And you don't even get to play with them, neither.

15
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:51,780
I hate it.

16
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:55,680
I used to accidentally walk on all the dead bodies all the time,

17
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:57,080
and everyone would get mad at me,

18
00:00:57,080 --> 00:01:00,200
as if the dead body wouldn't still be there after I stepped on it.

19
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:04,600
You're tampering with evidence! Don't step there! Don't put your hands on that!

20
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:10,200
Hey buddy, you're tampering with my fucking good time! I'm into old dead

21
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:16,320
bodies now. Mummies, dinosaurs, mummified dinosaurs, all that crap. I'm the number

22
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:20,640
one Yoda archaeologist in all of the world and it helps that I'm so small. I

23
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:25,240
can get into places that other archaeologists can't. Anyway, I only

24
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:30,520
I only learned archaeology when I was in prison because I was bored and the other guys seemed like they already knew about it

25
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:34,140
So that's why I did it. I really don't give a shit about anything that I do

26
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:37,840
I just do it because I'm bored and it seems like it would be fun

27
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:43,120
The last two years have been a blur really I'm amazed that I remember even half of this stuff

28
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:48,760
I don't even remember why I'm here something about some guy named Sean McDonald's and a bunch of fucking Jollibee's

29
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:52,260
I don't fucking care. I just want to see a weird thing

30
00:01:53,620 --> 00:01:57,620
That's what's so great about archaeology. It's just a bunch of old weird stuff

31
00:01:57,620 --> 00:02:04,160
Anyway, I think we're having slop for lunch today and the guy in the cafeteria told me he would sell me some cigarettes if I let

32
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:05,980
him have mine

33
00:02:05,980 --> 00:02:07,980
So yeah

34
00:02:07,980 --> 00:02:12,740
Patrick Yoda is now mysteriously an archaeologist. He's behind bars

35
00:02:12,740 --> 00:02:20,720
We pan over to another cell where a young who V and crime fighter sits in a windowless room

36
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:27,120
Diagnosed with Joker disorder a court-sanctioned ball was given to him to toss against his wall

37
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:35,000
His monkey sits idly in his own smaller room within the room slowly losing oxygen as he rereads in search of lost time

38
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,580
so

39
00:02:37,580 --> 00:02:38,700
Botas

40
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:40,940
My name is professor blow toss piss

41
00:02:40,940 --> 00:02:47,820
I am a who from whoville and I am known worldwide for my impressive hands-on knowledge of Christmas curios and Arctic artifacts

42
00:02:47,820 --> 00:02:53,460
I uncovered the lost tomb of Fred Claus, stole back the crystal present from Hanukkah bandits,

43
00:02:53,460 --> 00:02:56,700
and watched the third Harold and Kumar movie 18 times.

44
00:02:56,700 --> 00:03:01,220
I was a part of SEAL Team 7, the team that went in after SEAL Team 6 to retrieve Osama

45
00:03:01,220 --> 00:03:03,380
bin Laden's legendary snow globe.

46
00:03:03,380 --> 00:03:07,420
I alternate weeks between spelunking into the Krusty Krab's walk-in freezer to search for

47
00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:12,380
Spongebob's bones, and teaching advanced cultural defilement at Yule University, where I have

48
00:03:12,380 --> 00:03:16,460
never had any inappropriate relationships with any of the ugly students.

49
00:03:16,460 --> 00:03:24,220
The past year or so in prison, I have been trying to play the two rival gangs against

50
00:03:24,220 --> 00:03:27,760
each other by telling them the other one insulted them, but it just made both of them beat me

51
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:30,060
up twice as much as they would have otherwise.

52
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:32,140
Also, pet monkey named Patrick.

53
00:03:32,140 --> 00:03:34,140
Okay, cool.

54
00:03:34,140 --> 00:03:36,960
So we have another archaeologist.

55
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:43,780
He didn't even, doesn't seem like he ever was a detective.

56
00:03:43,780 --> 00:03:49,300
We pay it one final time, much further down the hall, due to complaints from some of the

57
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:56,740
female guards, to a room made of mirrors, where a computer-hacked demon stares vacantly

58
00:03:56,740 --> 00:03:59,100
at himself while jacking off.

59
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:02,860
This has completely occupied the demon part of this creature, much to the dismay of his

60
00:04:02,860 --> 00:04:05,380
logical, computer half.

61
00:04:05,380 --> 00:04:06,380
Sup?

62
00:04:06,380 --> 00:04:09,860
You know the drill by now.

63
00:04:09,860 --> 00:04:12,660
I am a computer, attached to the back of a demon.

64
00:04:12,660 --> 00:04:20,540
How do I make that fit the theme you ask? Well, I I guess I'm like a I'm like a sundial or

65
00:04:20,540 --> 00:04:23,400
Like a Mayan sundial

66
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:26,840
And I guess instead of like a demon I have like some sort of

67
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:33,600
Like Nazi like you know, it never mind. No, I'm just gonna I'm just gonna stick with the computer thing

68
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:41,180
Still a computer on a demon's back, but now I'm an archaeology professor and I do adventures and fucking titty fuck my students

69
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:43,800
God damn, I love college.

70
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:52,440
These three have been placed in Shane Dawson maximum security prison for the murder of a one

71
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:59,160
PapiChuco CEO of PapiChuco's TechnoSlime as well as resisting arrest murder of a civilian

72
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:01,760
breaking and entering in private property

73
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:08,380
Impersonating a celebrity which has been outlawed since Pete Davidson quote-unquote impersonated former president Travis Scott

74
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:12,120
and at least three charges of Yoda trafficking.

75
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:16,720
Their court-appointed lawyer, Alan Iverson, failed to show up for a single

76
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:21,000
trial, which by default, as per Gun City's Kamala Harris truancy law, means they

77
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,000
receive the maximum sentence.

78
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:29,040
A cat screeches over the loudspeaker, meaning it's time for dinner at the

79
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:35,360
Shane Dawson maximum security prison, or to have a conjugal visit. For our three

80
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:35,920
heroes,

81
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:37,940

82
00:05:37,940 --> 00:05:41,660
i think i'm gonna have a conjugal visit

83
00:05:41,660 --> 00:05:43,740

87
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:58,860
okay yeah your slop so the slop gets slid under

88
00:05:58,860 --> 00:06:02,660
the under the bars of the jail cell

89
00:06:02,660 --> 00:06:06,140
And what do you do do you just do you go to town on it?

90
00:06:06,140 --> 00:06:10,300
Yeah, yeah, you see somebody like pull a curtain falls over

91
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:17,640
You can still see through the bars, but there's a like please knock

92
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:21,260
You're like

Okay, cool. What's your last meal blowtoss?

candy cane. You had a candy cane? Yeah. Yeah, so your windowless room is unsealed and a giant

96
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:40,860
candy cane is brought in and a smaller one is brought in for your monkey as well. I didn't

97
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:48,700
want a big one. Take this back. Okay, boss. Takes it back. Do I get a small one though? Yeah,

98
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:54,460

99
00:06:54,460 --> 00:06:56,460
- Who did the computer pick?

100
00:06:56,460 --> 00:06:58,220
- The key to my cell.

101
00:06:58,220 --> 00:07:00,000
(laughing)

102
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,800
You see one of the Jollibee's, says,

103
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:03,600
"Nice try man, but it's not gonna work this time."

104
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:04,440
- Alright, fine.

105
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:05,280
- Alright, fine.

106
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:06,720
- You almost got me last time.

107
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:08,400
- Okay, chips.

108
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:09,240
- Okay, fine.

109
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:10,440
What kind of chips?

110
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:11,880
- Kettle cooked jalapeno chips.

111
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:13,680
- We don't, that's so specific.

112
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:15,640
- This is the worst prison ever.

113
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:16,480
- It's not great.

114
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:17,320
- Oh, fuck.

115
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:19,200
- You can see how much I get paid.

116
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:23,000
- Alphabet soup?

117
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,720
we got that actually oh no I regret it

118
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:28,400
comes look as you're handed your last

119
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:30,560
meals once you finish eating them a

120
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:32,720
teleporter beam like appears in each of

121
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:36,480
yourselves and you hear a voice over you

122
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:39,400
hear first you hear why stop Shane and

123
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:48,000
then you hear please step in here and

124
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,480
then you hear a voice a please step in

125
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:57,360
here for your execution sponsored by Uniqlo. I jump in. Okay you jump in? Yeah.

126
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:04,680
I just kind of... But I hold my breath. I'm not done. I have a feeling that's gonna pay off.

127
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:10,360
I am smoking a cigarette and the slop is also smoking a cigarette and we're kind

128
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:13,400
of in the bunk beds together. If you do not step into your execution beam

129
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:18,160
sponsored by Uniqlo the beam will come to you. And I say to the slop, I turn to

130
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:23,480
the slap and I go, "Was that good enough? Was that as good for you as it was for me?"

131
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:28,160
"Yeah man, it was pretty good. Might as well sound like Meerod."

132
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:30,160
"I guess so, yeah."

133
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:36,160
Alright, that's all I needed to hear. And then I jumped down the bunk beds, but for me, because I'm a Yoda, it's so big.

134
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:37,160
Yeah, sure.

135
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:40,160
I jump down and as I'm jumping down I go, "BRAAAA!"

136
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:42,160
[laughter]

137
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:44,160
Just like, both your legs.

138
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:46,160
Right at the beginning.

139
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:48,960
You fall into the beam of screaming.

140
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:49,800
Blowtoss, do you go in?

141
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:52,320
- I throw my monkey in first, just to see what happens.

142
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:53,400
(monkey screeches)

143
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:55,720
- And just flies in there.

144
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:56,560
- Yeah, fuck it.

145
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:57,400
- You don't see it yet.

146
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:58,600
- I don't even wait to see what happens.

147
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:01,040
- Your execution will be in a massive coliseum,

148
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:02,520
filmed live in front of millions

149
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:04,940
on the 24-hour execution channel.

150
00:09:04,940 --> 00:09:08,040
You all have the coveted 805 to 807 spot,

151
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:09,580
the primus of prime time.

152
00:09:09,580 --> 00:09:13,880
Do you guys have any last words before I kill you?

153
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:20,920
school sucks I love college and hate all the party or I hate college but love all

154
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:26,000
the parties that guy took both of my ideas

155
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:39,040
for appearing in a Coliseum but but but but but rather than that you teleport

156
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:43,060
into a sparse gray room which you recognize immediately to be the

157
00:09:43,060 --> 00:09:48,660
warden's office the warden Barney the dinosaur looks up from his desk and

158
00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:53,200
greets you might as well just throw him in there he's got to be in there guys

159
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:58,180
that would he I didn't look it up before this I'm Barney I'm Barney have you

160
00:09:58,180 --> 00:10:04,660
enjoyed your time in prison so much yes behind Barney's been the best two years

161
00:10:04,660 --> 00:10:09,900
of my life is a strange and slender Anglican gentleman dressed to the nines

162
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:15,500
in new Victorian garb. It's N-E-U, Victorian. Imagine Jonathan Davis style

163
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:21,100
dreads with black patchwork pants topped with a long Victorian coat with flame

164
00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:27,380
decals, skull cufflinks, buckled like scaly like dragon scale boots and a

165
00:10:27,380 --> 00:10:30,380
completely black monocle.

166
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:32,380
You're an eyepatch really.

167
00:10:32,380 --> 00:10:34,380
Well it seems you have lucked out.

168
00:10:34,380 --> 00:10:42,620
I uh this gentleman over here has decided that he has enough money to release you

169
00:10:42,620 --> 00:10:49,980
thank you so much Jamiroquai my name's not Jamiroquai well that's what I'm

170
00:10:49,980 --> 00:10:54,840
gonna call you well I'll take it my name is Leo the

171
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:59,100
collector and thanks to my considerable wealth and influence you three are

172
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:03,340
conditionally pardoned of your crimes and free to live your lives in gun City

173
00:11:03,340 --> 00:11:08,340
but those conditions for this I can explain on the way over to my face

174
00:11:08,340 --> 00:11:15,460
except well that's good but you sure you sure you don't want to hear I'm just

175
00:11:15,460 --> 00:11:23,060
looking at something on the other wall over to my floating island in the sky

176
00:11:23,060 --> 00:11:27,340
would you like to join me it's either that or you will be executed I have to

177
00:11:27,340 --> 00:11:33,740
make that sort of clear it would be crazy if you chose execution now that I think

178
00:11:33,740 --> 00:11:48,580
about it as a DM I shouldn't have given you three that that option can we take a

179
00:11:48,580 --> 00:11:52,380
few years to think about it and just like Jill outside the jail require what

180
00:11:52,380 --> 00:11:59,180
funniest outcome oh if we do that it could be a ghost campaign and I'd have

181
00:11:59,180 --> 00:12:02,220
to come up with it out of nowhere

182
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:08,220
the only reason I'm not saying you don't have a map for heaven

183
00:12:08,220 --> 00:12:14,660
drawn also you're actually in my apartment and I'm afraid you'll hit me

184
00:12:14,660 --> 00:12:24,140
yes I accept your offer what what kind of what what is on your island my island

185
00:12:24,140 --> 00:12:31,820
has anything you need all right well hey I'm sold sort of figure of speech what

186
00:12:31,820 --> 00:12:36,340
do you need do you need like insulin we have that just checking why are you

187
00:12:36,340 --> 00:12:39,820
asking him why you asking me about that I just meant like things you wouldn't

188
00:12:39,820 --> 00:12:41,820
No, it's you specifically

189
00:12:41,820 --> 00:12:46,700
Patrick Yoda was canon, you know looks like

190
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:54,000
What oh, I'm sorry, that's must be quite difficult. I'm actually not I just wanted to see what you would say

191
00:12:54,000 --> 00:13:00,220
Well, you see that I'm quite polite. I won't be so polite. I think I don't trust you. No, that's fair

192
00:13:00,220 --> 00:13:04,980
Hey guys, you got to see this. There's a picture of a kitten hanging on to a branch and it says hang in there

193
00:13:04,980 --> 00:13:07,380
Oh my god. You see Barney walk over to that.

194
00:13:07,380 --> 00:13:11,380
Yes, that was my favorite painting that my niece drew for me.

195
00:13:11,380 --> 00:13:12,980
Pull the painting off the wall.

196
00:13:12,980 --> 00:13:17,780
We're gonna- wait, boys! We're escaping this goddamn place.

197
00:13:17,780 --> 00:13:19,480
Come on, get some spoons!

198
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:22,680
Wait, I- can I take Barney's suit off?

199
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:25,780
Now that we're not in jail anymore.

200
00:13:25,780 --> 00:13:27,780
You try to grab Barney...

201
00:13:27,780 --> 00:13:31,780
And it's just- it's his neck and his head and it's everything.

202
00:13:31,780 --> 00:13:33,580
Okay, sorry, I thought it might be a costume.

203
00:13:33,580 --> 00:13:39,420
No, that happens all the time. Normally I would have you killed, but again, this guy paid me a lot of money.

204
00:13:39,420 --> 00:13:42,620
Okay, you know what? I just got one question about his island.

205
00:13:42,620 --> 00:13:44,120
Sure.

206
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:50,140
What do you do on there? Do you do weird sex stuff on there, or do you just kind of have it there for like bass fishing or something?

207
00:13:50,140 --> 00:13:50,640
No. No.

208
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:53,960
Yeah, then I'm not going.

209
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:54,460
I mean...

210
00:13:54,460 --> 00:13:59,180
Do you have a statue to Moloch?

211
00:13:59,180 --> 00:13:59,680
No.

212
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:01,780
Hey, no for me.

213
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:06,280
Well, you know what look I can't say looking at your weird shoes

214
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:11,320
And I think that maybe your island might have some crazy sex stuff for me, so I'm gonna go well

215
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:17,060
I can't deny that people have come to my island and have done things and I've looked the other way so if you hold on

216
00:14:17,060 --> 00:14:25,980
Legal sex stuff that's crazy. Yes, of course let me make that clarification on this podcast, okay?

217
00:14:25,980 --> 00:14:29,040
well then

218
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:31,720
Can we can we go?

219
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:44,440
So yeah you uh yeah you all follow Leo the Collector out of the the the Warden's

220
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:52,420
office down the hall up the stairs to a roof where you see his giant airship that

221
00:14:52,420 --> 00:14:59,560
looks like like a British wooden galleon ship from like the 1700s you see him take

222
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:05,280
out a remote and press it and like a *creak* like a door opens up that even though it's

223
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:08,920
like looks like it's made of wood you can quickly assess that it's just designed to

224
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:09,920
look like that.

225
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:10,920
That's a Wii!

226
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:13,760
Oh my god he's got the wooden Wii!

227
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:16,600
I do have a Wii if you'd like to see one.

228
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:18,080
They're quite great.

229
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:22,760
I collect all manner of old consoles, Wiis, PS7s, anything you could imagine.

230
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:24,800
Do you have the N-Gage?

231
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:29,040
The N-Gage escapes my grasp yet again.

232
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:31,040
One day, one day.

233
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:37,600
I like this one, he knows what the end gauge is.

234
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:43,840
So yeah, you load onto his boat, it's lush, there's leather and velvet and all those types

235
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:48,240
of materials you use when you describe lush things.

236
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:50,800
First thing I do is fuck that couch.

237
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:51,800
Okay.

238
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:53,120
Roll a performance check.

239
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:54,120
Okay.

240
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:55,120
Do the first roll of the campaign.

241
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:57,600
As if he could fuck a couch again.

242
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:58,600
Yeah, absolutely.

243
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:04,720
with the same respect you all are 12 at your performance so that's plus 3 plus

244
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:13,520
3 15 you fucking good yes you roll perception check quickly 3 mm no never

245
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:19,160
mind what a funny joke about your couch moan but you don't hear it so it's just

246
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:25,480
a regular kids regular couch yeah yeah so you fuck the couch Leo quickly like

247
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:29,680
locks down that room, like, finds a way to do that.

248
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:32,920
You fly for probably about, like, a little under an hour

249
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:35,040
to a, like, massive island in the sky.

250
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:38,080
And so some stuff you guys would perhaps know

251
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:41,680
about part of the world of Gun City

252
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:44,720
is that there are very, very few people

253
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:46,640
who can afford to have an island in the sky.

254
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:50,280
You have to be so astronomically rich.

255
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:52,400
So he, and it's not just an island in the sky

256
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:54,040
that, like, just has his mansion.

257
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:57,840
you pull up to it you see a massive mansion and you see like another

258
00:16:57,840 --> 00:17:02,320
building that you can't quite make out what it is yet you see what is clearly a

259
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:08,520
private school a hospital like you see that he has his own sort of town here

260
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:14,920
and you pull in the ship pulls in you see the island like makes the same noise

261
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:20,520
one of the only noises I have for doors opening opens up and like the island

262
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:24,000
like it looks like rock on the bottom of it like a floating island opens up and

263
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:30,120
lets the ship in and it sort of situates itself in there and you file out of

264
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:32,760
there and you're in this like massive hangar you see all these Jollibee

265
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:36,280
attendants running around and like helping make things work and they say

266
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:40,400
"Well welcome back Master Leo!" "Well thank you, thank you Jollibee." "And these are

267
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:45,120
your servants?" "They are..." "You have slaves?" "No, no I do not have slaves." "But they called you

268
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:51,120
Master." "Yeah they said Master." "Master is just a formal title in England."

269
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:57,960
there what the hell is England? Sky England! Is that what this place is? Well it had a

270
00:17:57,960 --> 00:18:06,480
different name but now it is. First thing first I'm gonna ask one of your slaves

271
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:14,700
to get me Apollo back. Oh what excuse me? From Jollibee. Oh sure I'm not gonna say

272
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:21,060
slave one even though that was the first thought. Jollibee come! Hello can you get

273
00:18:21,060 --> 00:18:26,860
whatever it is he said? Apollo back. Apollo back. It's not that hard to pronounce.

274
00:18:26,860 --> 00:18:32,180
I just haven't heard. I just personally haven't heard of it before that's all.

275
00:18:32,180 --> 00:18:37,100
Brown shrimp spaghetti. Patrick I got it. Do you want to do a hungry hamster all over again?

276
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:40,340
Patrick's favorite thing to do is whenever Patches starts describing

277
00:18:40,340 --> 00:18:43,540
something that's happening Patrick goes okay first things first

278
00:18:43,540 --> 00:18:48,220
yeah that Jollibee runs off to get it he brings it back Apollo back what is it

279
00:18:48,220 --> 00:18:52,340
what is it describe Paul back to me so I know seafood pasta yeah it's like a

280
00:18:52,340 --> 00:18:59,860
brown sauce with like vermicelli pasta brown thing you get a plate of poop and

281
00:18:59,860 --> 00:19:04,980
yeah no you get you get the you get it and it tastes like nothing you've had

282
00:19:04,980 --> 00:19:10,380
before so you know Gun City doesn't have...

283
00:19:10,380 --> 00:19:12,380
Oh my god!

284
00:19:12,380 --> 00:19:14,380
The couch sneezes somewhere.

285
00:19:14,380 --> 00:19:20,100
The food in Gun City, you know, it's on planet E-Bomb. It's sourced on planet E-Bomb.

286
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:23,420
It's not the best food in the world. It doesn't taste like how Jollibee's food

287
00:19:23,420 --> 00:19:30,700
tastes in our time. But this swears, if you could imagine a time like 2020 and

288
00:19:30,700 --> 00:19:33,420
and you ate some of Jollibee's food. This tastes like it.

289
00:19:33,420 --> 00:19:35,900
This is amazing! Oh my fucking god!

290
00:19:35,900 --> 00:19:38,220
Yes, of course. The finest cuisine in all.

291
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:39,340
Right this way, please.

292
00:19:39,340 --> 00:19:41,100
Can we just stay? I don't care what you need us for.

293
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:42,220
Can we just stay here?

294
00:19:42,220 --> 00:19:43,260
Alright, we're leaving him behind.

295
00:19:43,260 --> 00:19:44,940
Can we just stay here?

296
00:19:44,940 --> 00:19:47,020
You certainly can for a time, but...

297
00:19:47,020 --> 00:19:50,060
I'm your new slave and I'll do whatever you want.

298
00:19:50,060 --> 00:19:52,300
Well, all I need you three to do is try...

299
00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:54,540
I'm a better slave than him.

300
00:19:54,540 --> 00:19:55,260
Well...

301
00:19:55,260 --> 00:19:56,220
I would be way better.

302
00:19:56,220 --> 00:19:58,380
I'm like the number one slave in the world.

303
00:19:58,380 --> 00:20:01,380
I don't care what happens.

304
00:20:01,380 --> 00:20:05,380
There's enough of me to go around to have you as slaves.

305
00:20:05,380 --> 00:20:12,380
Look, let's just first come with me to my mansion, come to my chambers, and we will...

306
00:20:12,380 --> 00:20:16,380
No, I saw that face. The podcast can't hear it.

307
00:20:16,380 --> 00:20:21,380
It's not sex. I'm just English. We just all sound like monsters.

308
00:20:21,380 --> 00:20:23,380
What kind of slave do you take me for?

309
00:20:25,380 --> 00:20:28,880
And yeah, he walks you out of the hangar.

310
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:31,880
You walk outside the hangar and into this...

311
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:34,880
Just clearly you look around, you can see there's like a biodome

312
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:37,380
and like an electric fence around the island.

313
00:20:37,380 --> 00:20:41,380
Like massive towers that are like protecting it.

314
00:20:41,380 --> 00:20:45,880
And the biodome keeps in this perpetual foggy London weather.

315
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:48,880
- That he loves. - It keeps in Pauley Shore and Billy Baldwin.

316
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:49,880
Yeah.

317
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:54,380
And you guys walk into his mansion and a Jolly B greets you there, of course.

318
00:20:54,380 --> 00:21:00,860
Um, and it's as big as you can imagine, it's as amazing as you can imagine, but what you

319
00:21:00,860 --> 00:21:06,660
really notice that makes this mansion different from other mansions is the amount of artifacts

320
00:21:06,660 --> 00:21:08,340
that are everywhere.

321
00:21:08,340 --> 00:21:10,440
And like, artifacts that you guys have heard of.

322
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:14,380
Some of them you know of and you didn't know who owned it, but you knew somebody did.

323
00:21:14,380 --> 00:21:17,920
Some of them you've heard of in legend, but never seen them before.

324
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:23,260
You see Wii's, you see, uh, you see like, uh, SNES.

325
00:21:23,260 --> 00:21:24,260
You see...

326
00:21:24,260 --> 00:21:25,260
That's an artifact.

327
00:21:25,260 --> 00:21:26,260
Yeah, oh yeah.

328
00:21:26,260 --> 00:21:34,500
You see Panasonic televisions, you see Sony Walkmans, you see like all these famous artifacts

329
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:40,380
in Gun City lore that you've heard of on Earth but like have never really seen.

330
00:21:40,380 --> 00:21:48,620
And as he walks you up the spiral staircase to his chambers, the door behind him closes

331
00:21:48,620 --> 00:21:50,460
and he locks it.

332
00:21:50,460 --> 00:21:54,900
he says, "It's only a precaution, I promise. I need to talk to you all about something."

333
00:21:54,900 --> 00:21:58,740
And he starts spinning around a globe, but it's a cube, and it's something you've also

334
00:21:58,740 --> 00:22:05,740
heard of. And he says, "He's got the cube globe, you guys. Holy fucking shit, you guys."

335
00:22:05,740 --> 00:22:09,740
This guy loves items. "Oh my god."

336
00:22:09,740 --> 00:22:15,780
"So, I... we need to talk briefly. I have something interesting I need to tell you all

337
00:22:15,780 --> 00:22:19,380
about. I'm sure I don't need to tell you all this, you're three of the most

338
00:22:19,380 --> 00:22:23,780
renowned archaeologists / adventurers / professors on the planet.

339
00:22:23,780 --> 00:22:32,380
Oh yeah. I bat my eyelashes at him. On my eyelids it says "love you".

340
00:22:32,380 --> 00:22:36,380
That's from the first Indiana Jones.

341
00:22:36,380 --> 00:22:41,820
But before earthlings arrived on planet E-Bomb, there were many a civilization.

342
00:22:41,820 --> 00:22:49,500
but none as storied or has lost the time as the Tamagotchi people. Thought of as

343
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:53,980
almost mystical in nature, recent discoveries have been made that suggest

344
00:22:53,980 --> 00:22:58,060
they do indeed exist. I believe some of you, one of you, have written papers on

345
00:22:58,060 --> 00:23:06,820
this. It was me, it was also me. I did. All three of you wrote, only two of you wrote. I just did

346
00:23:06,820 --> 00:23:11,700
whatever they were doing, I don't know if it was Tamagotchis or whatever the

347
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:23,100
hell that's it there is a ton of got you playing farm bill bro don't tell them

348
00:23:23,100 --> 00:23:34,340
about that I spent you know what I'll say it I spent $20 on the adventure

349
00:23:34,340 --> 00:23:38,640
capitalist do you remember that game oh yeah I do that fucking cookies like a

350
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:46,540
cookie clicker yeah no yeah I spent $20 on that you know no I haven't touched it

351
00:23:46,540 --> 00:23:53,480
in two years but I did open it the other you see like the scene in those it's

352
00:23:53,480 --> 00:24:03,280
just frozen as like that said there isn't a ton of scholarship on it but you

353
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:08,980
You know that the Tamagotchi people were famous for being really needy, and much of their

354
00:24:08,980 --> 00:24:16,780
infrastructure helped sort of lay the groundwork for many of the smaller city-states outside

355
00:24:16,780 --> 00:24:19,400
of Gunn City and on the rest of planet E-Bomb.

356
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:20,920
Like Palestine?

357
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:22,920
Like Palestine, yes.

358
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:24,400
Yeah, baby!

359
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:25,880
Yeah, baby!

360
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:27,200
Yeah, baby!

361
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:28,760
You caught me!

362
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:31,760
That's my real character!

363
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:33,760
Um, but the most...

364
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:35,760
That's the only reason I asked.

365
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:37,760
The thing that I have been...

366
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:39,760
I have been collecting for years now.

367
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:41,760
After I made my money doing this than the other thing.

368
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:43,760
I have been collecting for many years.

369
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:45,760
And...

370
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:47,760
The treasure that has eluded me,

371
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:49,760
besides the end gauge,

372
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:51,760
is another treasure.

373
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:53,760
That I have been laughed out of all types of collectors circles,

374
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:55,760
insisting that it is real.

375
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:57,760
But I know it is.

376
00:24:57,760 --> 00:24:59,760
And all three of you,

377
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:06,760
of you roll a history check with advantage to see if you know where it is.

378
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:07,760
16.

379
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:08,760
Roll again.

380
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:09,760
Roll again.

381
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:10,760
15.

382
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:11,760
Roll a d20 though.

383
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:12,760
Is this not a d20?

384
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:13,760
No.

385
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:14,760
Oh, it's a d12.

386
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:15,760
I don't even know what that roll was.

387
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:16,760
Hold on.

388
00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:17,760
Oh.

389
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:18,760
This is insane.

390
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:19,760
This is a disaster.

391
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:20,760
13.

392
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:21,760
Or no, 12.

393
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:22,760
You guys can move this table closer to you.

394
00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:23,760
I don't need it.

395
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:24,760
Shut up.

396
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:50,080
closer to you I figured my 16 okay that's pretty mine was 12 I got a 1 yeah you

397
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:54,880
didn't pay attention yeah to this part of the I already said I didn't know yeah

398
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:58,620
yeah yeah you're you're completely backed up based on the rolls what did you get

399
00:25:58,620 --> 00:26:06,100
your eyes 12 you know anything above a 10 knows what this this is I'm playing

400
00:26:06,100 --> 00:26:12,940
with a thread in my wall as you see Leo the collector talking about this mystical

401
00:26:12,940 --> 00:26:16,840
treasure that's allegedly connected to the Tamagotchi people the two of you

402
00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:21,560
know exactly what he's talking about and the second he says it you also say it at

403
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:31,240
the exact same time. The N-word Pass. Chocolate chips. No? I knew you two would be familiar.

404
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:37,520
I'm very familiar, yes. The mystical N-word Pass. He's maybe a little bit too

405
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:43,760
familiar. I don't know. The Tamagotchi people apparently spent hundreds of years

406
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:50,520
developing the correct technology and magics to create an actual n-word pass.

407
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:55,920
Do you understand the implications of this? Don't explain what the implications are.

408
00:26:55,920 --> 00:27:00,720
Caleb Pitt. I understand them and I'm worried that we might get too far into

409
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:06,560
the implications during this campaign. I'll tell you what, that is up to you. And

410
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:08,560
And it's a different N-word, right?

411
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:10,560
Moving on!

412
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:14,560
It's not the one worth thinking?

413
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:16,560
Nutella? No!

414
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:20,560
I thought it was a word for...

415
00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:22,560
Tamagotchis.

416
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:24,560
After Papa...

417
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:26,560
After Papi-chuco...

418
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:28,560
Can I say it?

419
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:32,560
There was a great gap in power over the last two years.

420
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:40,200
of control of the city. I'm not saying I can fill that same void, you know, my

421
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:46,320
businesses wouldn't certainly be able to fulfill such a thing, but if I have the

422
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:52,160
N-word pass, if we, three of us, four of us, you too Patrick, have the N-word pass,

423
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:59,520
we might be able to do a lot of good. And the worst part is there are

424
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:03,160
also other people going after it, and I know this for a fact because I have to

425
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:10,160
admit that I did consult archaeologist Pennsylvania Jim you guys would know

426
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:20,400
Pennsylvania Jim. FUCK! Yes he is all three of your rivals. Scott! I fucking hate that guy. He's so sexy but it sucks.

427
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:26,440
yeah his shirts always unbuttoned the correct way god damn it yeah he has it

428
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:29,800
buttoned at the top but he leaves two buttons at the bottom and his stomach

429
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:34,880
kanks out his stomach is so good cuz beauty standards and ebombs world are

430
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:40,600
different than Earth's yeah that's unfortunately true but yeah you would

431
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:45,040
know Pennsylvania gym is famous for saying stuff like Dwight what are you

432
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:47,320
doing

433
00:28:53,320 --> 00:28:58,920
Pam, uh, look I just want to see your pussy and things like that.

434
00:28:58,920 --> 00:29:00,920
Um, so and I love to see-

435
00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:02,920
Yeah, he stole Pam from Ray William Johnson.

436
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:04,920
That's right.

437
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:06,920
But I'm gonna get her back.

438
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:08,920
Back when he was going by Roy William Johnson.

439
00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:10,920
[Laughter]

440
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:15,920
Now, Pennsylvania Jim, look, you three were in prison.

441
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:19,920
I felt the urge, I felt the need to know more about it.

442
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:21,920
So I hired him for some time.

443
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:30,640
All he could do was translate some of the writings that I had discovered and he couldn't quite narrow down the location of the N-word pass.

444
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:38,840
But there is an artifact that will tell us where it is.

445
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:44,200
And it will luckily be at an auction that I'm holding tomorrow evening.

446
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:49,620
The auction is going to be hosting about seven to twelve objects.

447
00:29:49,620 --> 00:29:51,480
Probably closer to seven.

448
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:55,620
Looking at my notes, how many jokes did I write? Seven.

449
00:29:55,620 --> 00:29:57,620
So, um...

450
00:29:57,620 --> 00:30:02,120
And those... I found out that that's the appropriate auction number according to Google's...

451
00:30:02,120 --> 00:30:03,720
- Seven? - Seven to twelve.

452
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:06,520
- It's a little light, I feel like. - I thought it was light, but I feel...

453
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:08,320
I don't know who that advice is for.

454
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:11,120
I feel like we could break a record for longest auction pretty easily.

455
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:12,820
Yeah, I'm excited for that.

456
00:30:12,820 --> 00:30:13,820
- Twenty. - Um...

457
00:30:13,820 --> 00:30:15,220
Uh, so...

458
00:30:15,220 --> 00:30:21,380
Leo goes on, he says, "This auction time hosting will be in the events building."

459
00:30:21,380 --> 00:30:25,540
And he points, and you see outside the window that that building you saw

460
00:30:25,540 --> 00:30:28,580
is like a building he has for where he holds events.

461
00:30:28,580 --> 00:30:30,080
It just looks like the Pokemon Stadium.

462
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:31,620
It looks like Pokemon Stadium.

463
00:30:31,620 --> 00:30:33,460
Now it, now it...

464
00:30:33,460 --> 00:30:35,140
I have like a description for it.

465
00:30:35,140 --> 00:30:36,140
Oh, never mind.

466
00:30:36,140 --> 00:30:40,420
On the outside it looks like Pokemon Stadium, but then...

467
00:30:40,420 --> 00:30:41,420
Yeah.

468
00:30:41,420 --> 00:30:43,420
And

469
00:30:43,420 --> 00:30:45,620
He says tomorrow night there will be an auction

470
00:30:45,620 --> 00:30:50,980
it's we where there will be seven artifacts up for grabs and

471
00:30:50,980 --> 00:30:56,020
The last one will be the floppy disk that holds

472
00:30:56,020 --> 00:30:58,700
Del Isola de penguin

473
00:30:58,700 --> 00:31:04,120
which apparently has within it the location of

474
00:31:04,120 --> 00:31:06,700
if not

475
00:31:06,700 --> 00:31:12,660
The temple where it the inward pass exists at least a clue to where the temple is

476
00:31:12,660 --> 00:31:19,120
that's of course based on some research and then some things that the Pennsylvania gym said but I

477
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:25,500
Need that artifact tomorrow night the penguin of doom the temple of two penguin of doom

478
00:31:25,500 --> 00:31:29,860
Wow, that's right. I

Just I

480
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:39,340
I'm just guessing on the Spanish translation but well I mean you you do

481
00:31:39,340 --> 00:31:46,740
know that's the name of the campaign oh I didn't know that when he says the

482
00:31:46,740 --> 00:31:51,300
temple of the penguin of doom I just fall over backwards onto my ass yeah yeah

483
00:31:51,300 --> 00:31:57,980
good I pick him back up I fall over again I keep trying to pick him back up

484
00:31:57,980 --> 00:32:02,060
and he keeps you guys over doing that while Leo keeps talk it turns it turns

485
00:32:02,060 --> 00:32:07,760

00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:31,400
Well, that solves everything.

523
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:33,400
Okay, good.

524
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:35,400

533
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:05,080

534
00:36:05,080 --> 00:36:08,560
I'm spitting on him and telling him, I'm pissing on him and actually telling him it's raining.

629
00:43:32,940 --> 00:43:40,940
Leo. Wait what? No, there's no brother in this situation. He just said Leo. I said Leo said I could walk around.

630
00:43:40,940 --> 00:43:47,940
Oh sorry, I thought, I thought, no my bad, as a DM. That's also a great answer.

631
00:43:47,940 --> 00:43:58,940
Yeah she says, now she has to know, she has to be the Leo's brother. If you're Leo's guest, please walk around, just don't interfere with too many of the patients.

I just follow behind Patrick, even though I'm definitely not allowed to.

634
00:44:06,940 --> 00:44:09,940
Yeah, she assumes you're with him.

635
00:44:09,940 --> 00:44:11,940
He's Leo's brother too.

636
00:44:11,940 --> 00:44:12,940
No, he seems...

637
00:44:12,940 --> 00:44:17,940

649
00:45:10,820 --> 00:45:16,740

00:45:16,740 --> 00:45:21,380
intense high-intensity workouts with the ropes and shit but uh it said the ropes

651
00:45:21,380 --> 00:45:31,660
are lasers and yeah there's a there's like a it's like a you've been to um

652
00:45:31,660 --> 00:45:35,880
Disney you know those movies where you're in the seat in the screen so it's

653
00:45:35,880 --> 00:45:40,500
like the screen is like showing like a like a 4d movie yeah it's like a 4d

654
00:45:40,500 --> 00:45:45,540
movie that you're experiencing there's like you're watching back to the future

655
00:45:45,540 --> 00:45:50,540
Future 9 and it's like you're like you are Marty McFly.

656
00:45:50,540 --> 00:45:55,840
You are trying to change age of consent laws in the United States in the year 2005 and

657
00:45:55,840 --> 00:45:58,700
like there's just like lasers going by you as you're trying to work out.

658
00:45:58,700 --> 00:46:00,420
Roll strength check.

659
00:46:00,420 --> 00:46:01,420
Just straight strength.

660
00:46:01,420 --> 00:46:02,940
So just add your strength.

661
00:46:02,940 --> 00:46:04,540
Uh, six.

662
00:46:04,540 --> 00:46:05,540
Okay.

663
00:46:05,540 --> 00:46:06,540
Yeah.

664
00:46:06,540 --> 00:46:07,900
You get pretty winded from this workout.

665
00:46:07,900 --> 00:46:08,900
Not strong.

666
00:46:08,900 --> 00:46:09,900
Yeah.

667
00:46:09,900 --> 00:46:10,900
It's pretty hard to do this.

668
00:46:10,900 --> 00:46:15,500
Your demon is like, okay, like trying to like work out and fitness is about the

669
00:46:15,500 --> 00:46:19,760
journey not the results and you see a guy come and you go that's right I'm the

670
00:46:19,760 --> 00:46:26,900
instructor and also I'm in an anime I guess is the voice I chose keep going

671
00:46:26,900 --> 00:46:33,220
you got this yeah all right that's another gym there so we cut back I'm I'm

672
00:46:33,220 --> 00:46:37,980
I'm bent over I'm bent over the guy in a full body cast and the place where his

673
00:46:37,980 --> 00:46:42,940
pocket would be I've bored a hole using a pen by spinning it between my fingers

674
00:46:42,940 --> 00:46:49,820
And I'm sticking my finger into the hole and wiggling it around trying to feel if there's anything in his pocket under the cast

675
00:46:49,820 --> 00:46:55,840
You're gonna roll stealth check. I mean, there's not no I don't care if he notices. No, I mean just okay

676
00:46:55,840 --> 00:46:59,180
I see any staff. Okay, I mean like I don't care about that

677
00:46:59,180 --> 00:47:05,500
There's not that much of a chance nurses go on rotation. You're fine. Okay, you gotta get 23, I think yeah

678
00:47:05,500 --> 00:47:09,100
No, yeah, I got a 23. Yeah, I think okay, so I'm in the medicine cabinet

679
00:47:10,120 --> 00:47:12,480
Does he have wait does he have anything in his pocket? Oh?

680
00:47:12,480 --> 00:47:15,680
Yeah, that's a good question. Yeah. He does he has

681
00:47:15,680 --> 00:47:20,040
He has keys to a Volkswagen Jetta I

682
00:47:20,040 --> 00:47:23,740
Try to I try to pull them out through the hole

683
00:47:23,740 --> 00:47:28,860
But they don't fit and I just rip a giant chunk of his cast off of his body without him. No

684
00:47:28,860 --> 00:47:33,460
Yeah, it's all fine. He's had a full body. Yeah completely passed out

685
00:47:33,460 --> 00:47:39,200
Yeah, you get keys for that though. Those are technically an artifact see maybe you can sell them

686
00:47:39,200 --> 00:47:42,400
but yeah what are you doing? What are you doing, Pascado?

687
00:47:42,400 --> 00:47:45,860
You're just rolling and not telling me what you're doing.

688
00:47:45,860 --> 00:47:49,560
What I got, 12? But I don't know what you're doing!

689
00:47:49,560 --> 00:47:54,560
I'll tell you after.

690
00:47:54,560 --> 00:47:58,120
I've opened... Alright, so I'm in the medicine cabinet. Yeah, you are.

691
00:47:58,120 --> 00:48:01,160
I'm in the medicine cabinet. I guess you kind of mentioned that earlier.

692
00:48:01,160 --> 00:48:06,520
So I decided that my role determines what I find.

693
00:48:06,520 --> 00:48:10,720
and I should have said that I was my favorite part about this is that Patrick

694
00:48:10,720 --> 00:48:15,160
is the dungeon master yeah my favorite parts about playing one of those it's

695
00:48:15,160 --> 00:48:19,760
collaboration you know yeah reads exactly a breed we're both the dungeon

696
00:48:19,760 --> 00:48:25,680
master yeah we have both of peas yeah name beginning of our name but uh so I

697
00:48:25,680 --> 00:48:31,720
yeah so what do you find I'm in the I'm in the what do I add to that so it's a

698
00:48:31,720 --> 00:48:43,120
15? I guess investigation. Okay. Oh cool so that is a 17. 17 okay wow yeah you find

699
00:48:43,120 --> 00:48:47,880
some like choice techno slime pills. Oh fuck yeah so I just pocket those

700
00:48:47,880 --> 00:48:55,640
immediately. Yeah so add to your inventory five more techno slime refills and I

701
00:48:55,640 --> 00:48:58,760
guess I guess if they're a first-time listeners I should have said this maybe

702
00:48:58,760 --> 00:49:03,080
Yeah, explain techno slime. So techno slime is sort of the catch-all

703
00:49:03,080 --> 00:49:08,560
Opium for the masses in the world of gun city and

704
00:49:08,560 --> 00:49:14,500
Everybody has it everybody takes it to some extent. It's sort of like Adderall if you're a rich kid

705
00:49:14,500 --> 00:49:19,720
Everyone's doing it and it gives you a little bit of an advantage, but there's a chance you can get addicted to it

706
00:49:19,720 --> 00:49:21,720
So there's an addiction system

707
00:49:21,720 --> 00:49:27,100
But they need techno slime to cast like cast quote-unquote spells, but basically do special abilities

708
00:49:27,120 --> 00:49:32,880
But they need to refill it and every time they do there's a chance they can get addicted and so we'll see that addiction system

709
00:49:32,880 --> 00:49:36,620
Throughout this campaign or this arc I should say

710
00:49:36,620 --> 00:49:43,240
All right, and yeah you find that both of you roll a perception check

711
00:49:43,240 --> 00:49:45,680
20

712
00:49:45,680 --> 00:49:47,800
So it's dirty 20. Yeah, hmm

713
00:49:47,800 --> 00:49:51,680
10 plus

714
00:49:51,760 --> 00:49:52,760
I got an 18.

715
00:49:52,760 --> 00:49:53,460
Okay.

716
00:49:53,460 --> 00:49:56,060
Yeah, you both notice that like if you stay in here for much

717
00:49:56,060 --> 00:49:58,660
longer, there are nurses that are going to come in and check

718
00:49:58,660 --> 00:49:59,460
on this guy.

719
00:49:59,460 --> 00:50:02,660
Yeah, I mean, I hop on camera and shoulders and walk away.

720
00:50:02,660 --> 00:50:03,360
Yeah.

721
00:50:03,360 --> 00:50:05,460
Yeah, you get the sense of the rotations kind of coming up.

722
00:50:05,460 --> 00:50:05,660
Yes.

723
00:50:05,660 --> 00:50:06,560
You guys start walking away.

724
00:50:06,560 --> 00:50:07,560
You walk out of there.

725
00:50:07,560 --> 00:50:10,560
There's now just a taller Yoda walking out of the hospital.

726
00:50:10,560 --> 00:50:12,060
You make it out of there.

Man I hate being a slave and yeah, we cut away from that and

764
00:52:16,540 --> 00:52:19,580
Yeah, you guys sort of spent the day

765
00:52:19,580 --> 00:52:22,100
stealing drugs from a hospital

766
00:52:22,100 --> 00:52:27,620
stealing the hearts of salesmen and fucking up at the gym and

767
00:52:27,620 --> 00:52:31,460
Starting to get around dusk. And so you head back to Leo's mansion and

768
00:52:33,080 --> 00:52:38,680
You walk in there you go to Leo's study or his chamber or whatever the fuck and you see him there

769
00:52:38,680 --> 00:52:44,360
He says it's almost time for the the auction so head over to the event center

770
00:52:44,360 --> 00:52:47,320
Bring Sullivan with you and be on the lookout

771
00:52:47,320 --> 00:52:54,200
I I've recently received some intel from some of my security detail that there are people who might be trying to steal some of the

772
00:52:54,200 --> 00:52:56,120
artifacts that are on display

773
00:52:56,120 --> 00:53:00,720
And I would assume that the floppy disk that can holy shit

774
00:53:01,760 --> 00:53:02,760
That contains...

775
00:53:02,760 --> 00:53:03,760
In fact, Stevia did.

776
00:53:03,760 --> 00:53:04,760
Sorry.

777
00:53:04,760 --> 00:53:05,760
Yeah, Stevia gets you.

778
00:53:05,760 --> 00:53:06,760
Really?

779
00:53:06,760 --> 00:53:10,760
That contains the, uh, uh, Isola de la Penguin.

780
00:53:10,760 --> 00:53:13,260
Uh, is that what I said?

781
00:53:13,260 --> 00:53:14,260
Might be there.

782
00:53:14,260 --> 00:53:16,720
They might be stealing that one in particular.

783
00:53:16,720 --> 00:53:19,160
That one that we need to know where to go next.

784
00:53:19,160 --> 00:53:21,760
Did everybody also get the Apple News notification?

785
00:53:21,760 --> 00:53:22,760
I think I did.

786
00:53:22,760 --> 00:53:23,760
I guess so.

787
00:53:23,760 --> 00:53:24,760
Or is it Twitch?

788
00:53:24,760 --> 00:53:25,760
It was Twitch.

789
00:53:25,760 --> 00:53:26,760
Is Jubio?

790
00:53:26,760 --> 00:53:27,760

791
00:53:27,760 --> 00:53:28,760
Jubio's live.

792
00:53:28,760 --> 00:53:29,760
Shout out to Jubio.

793
00:53:29,760 --> 00:53:32,680
- Yeah, we all got the notification.

794
00:53:32,680 --> 00:53:33,740
- I see, that's huge.

795
00:53:33,740 --> 00:53:37,360
- Yeah, and Sullivan the Frog sort of comes up to you all

796
00:53:37,360 --> 00:53:41,040
and says, "All right, so it's about 8.15 now,

797
00:53:41,040 --> 00:53:45,280
"so we walk over there, we'll get there by 8.30,

798
00:53:45,280 --> 00:53:46,860
"just in time for the cocktail hour.

799
00:53:46,860 --> 00:53:50,800
"They're gonna have those little shrimp things."

800
00:53:50,800 --> 00:53:51,640
- Shrimp.

801
00:53:51,640 --> 00:53:52,960
- Shrimp cocktail?

802
00:53:52,960 --> 00:53:55,440
- It's different, it's different than just shrimp,

803
00:53:55,440 --> 00:53:57,560
and I didn't hear what the other--

804
00:53:57,560 --> 00:53:59,060
- I said shrimp cocktail.

805
00:53:59,060 --> 00:54:01,860
Oh, perhaps, but I didn't see that.

806
00:54:01,860 --> 00:54:02,700
What did you say?

807
00:54:02,700 --> 00:54:03,660
Shrimp at Touffee.

808
00:54:03,660 --> 00:54:05,700
Shrimp, bottle, box, or brides?

809
00:54:05,700 --> 00:54:07,900
Definitely not, just 'cause I don't know what that is.

810
00:54:07,900 --> 00:54:09,420
Small pieces of shrimp.

811
00:54:09,420 --> 00:54:11,340
Small pieces, he might.

812
00:54:11,340 --> 00:54:13,740
I'm sorry, I said shrimp, I guess.

813
00:54:13,740 --> 00:54:17,020
He walks out and you follow him.

814
00:54:17,020 --> 00:54:18,020
Coconut shrimp?

815
00:54:18,020 --> 00:54:20,900
I'm listing off new types of shrimp to him.

816
00:54:20,900 --> 00:54:21,740
Even though I don't know--

817
00:54:21,740 --> 00:54:23,980
You're just doing the bubba gup.

818
00:54:23,980 --> 00:54:25,460
Even though I don't know where we're going,

819
00:54:25,460 --> 00:54:27,660
I walk in front of him to assert dominance.

820
00:54:27,660 --> 00:54:28,540
(laughing)

821
00:54:28,540 --> 00:54:34,540
yeah you keep like walking towards another I'm going down any any alley that

822
00:54:34,540 --> 00:54:39,460
I see he tries to guide you it's this way I know where I'm going

823
00:54:39,460 --> 00:54:46,300
ok ok and he knows I know and ok and yeah you guys end up at the event place

824
00:54:46,300 --> 00:54:52,220
and you see the event the event center Leo's event center and it's like a place

825
00:54:52,220 --> 00:54:56,300
that you see that it's like a concert hall right now it looks like a concert

826
00:54:56,300 --> 00:54:59,500
Hall and when you see a Jollibee as you guys walk in you're the first people to

827
00:54:59,500 --> 00:55:04,860
arrive pull lever and you watch and watch it all like sort of morph into now

828
00:55:04,860 --> 00:55:10,620
like an auction house like there's a large atrium in the center a balcony a

829
00:55:10,620 --> 00:55:15,940
balcony sort of like on the in like the on the overlooking sort of the the

830
00:55:15,940 --> 00:55:20,380
center like a skylight now as well and like sort of chairs that are like kind

831
00:55:20,380 --> 00:55:23,780
of like fold out looking chairs but like kind of a little bit nicer and then like

832
00:55:23,780 --> 00:55:27,560
little stage. Men in black chairs? Men in black, I don't know whether there's a men in black.

833
00:55:27,560 --> 00:55:34,400
Just say yes. And I don't know why I asked, that was so stupid. Why would I do that to you?

834
00:55:34,400 --> 00:55:39,960
How long you been doing this? He says that and you're just asking questions.

835
00:55:39,960 --> 00:55:47,240
No go ahead, elaborate. Please elaborate Patrick. I'm sure that won't derail us.

836
00:55:47,240 --> 00:55:52,520
Yeah, so it's a center that it's a concert hall, a circus tent,

837
00:55:52,520 --> 00:55:56,840
whatever the needs of the occasion, except a quinceanera because of a pending lawsuit.

838
00:55:56,840 --> 00:56:02,920
The way it is currently configured, it's like a large open atrium in the main area.

839
00:56:02,920 --> 00:56:08,120
There's a skylight up top, a balcony and circles the whole of the main area.

840
00:56:08,120 --> 00:56:12,360
I said that already. And on the ground level, there's also like a large hallway.

841
00:56:12,360 --> 00:56:16,600
So there's like a main area in the center and then like several doors.

842
00:56:16,600 --> 00:56:19,320
And if you go out there, there's like a long hallway that sort of also

843
00:56:20,040 --> 00:56:25,640
encapsulates it. On the outside it looks like Pokemon Stadium though. Some of the

844
00:56:25,640 --> 00:56:30,800
rooms off that hallway are devoted to kitchen and staff. Some of them are

845
00:56:30,800 --> 00:56:35,560
like bathrooms and some of them are private gathering rooms and one of them

846
00:56:35,560 --> 00:56:39,040
is a storage for some of the artifacts that are gonna be on display.

847
00:56:39,040 --> 00:56:46,000
Okay. Who's in charge of the auction? Me. The auctioneer is his name. Okay. Can I

848
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:49,800
walk up to the auctioneer? Yeah sure you walk up to this sort of... How tall is the

849
00:56:49,800 --> 00:56:59,520
auctioneer can you hold on he's about five nine okay and he's uh he's sort of

850
00:56:59,520 --> 00:57:06,360
out he's dressed in like a tux he looks like a yeah I'm still in prison

851
00:57:06,360 --> 00:57:15,920
Leo laid out for you guys like fancy clothes I did not change I'm wearing

852
00:57:15,920 --> 00:57:19,920
black and white stripes and a black V and Johnny Cash concert.

853
00:57:19,920 --> 00:57:23,920
I took a sharpie and I drew a tuxedo on my prison uniform.

854
00:57:23,920 --> 00:57:26,420
There was a tux in front of you and you were just like, "Nah."

855
00:57:26,420 --> 00:57:30,420
I looked at it and I looked at it just for reference because I thought that was really nice.

856
00:57:30,420 --> 00:57:34,420
While I was at the gym I flexed too hard and I ripped the entire outfit off and I'm naked.

857
00:57:34,420 --> 00:57:35,920
You were wearing a tuxedo at the gym.

858
00:57:35,920 --> 00:57:38,420
Yeah, and I'm naked now.

859
00:57:38,420 --> 00:57:40,420
That explains your role, yeah.

860
00:57:40,420 --> 00:57:43,920
Yeah, you're, you know, you're like, you look like a Chippendales dancer.

861
00:57:43,920 --> 00:57:46,880
Yeah, I'm naked but like a Winnie the Pooh is naked.

862
00:57:46,880 --> 00:57:47,880
Yeah, that's right.

863
00:57:47,880 --> 00:57:48,880
It's you and Sullivan.

864
00:57:48,880 --> 00:57:49,880
It's cute.

865
00:57:49,880 --> 00:57:50,880
It's very cute.

866
00:57:50,880 --> 00:57:53,640
Sullivan sees that and he's like, "Oh, hello fellow travelers."

867
00:57:53,640 --> 00:57:54,640
Shut the fuck up.

868
00:57:54,640 --> 00:57:55,640
Okay.

869
00:57:55,640 --> 00:57:56,640
And uh...

870
00:57:56,640 --> 00:57:57,640
Don't talk to my friend like that.

871
00:57:57,640 --> 00:57:58,640
So you go up to the auctioneer.

872
00:57:58,640 --> 00:58:01,840
I go up to the auctioneer and I hold up the Volkswagen car keys and I say, "Can I sell

873
00:58:01,840 --> 00:58:02,840
this?"

874
00:58:02,840 --> 00:58:03,840
Oh, let me...

875
00:58:03,840 --> 00:58:04,840
Oh wow.

876
00:58:04,840 --> 00:58:05,840
Can I sell this?

877
00:58:05,840 --> 00:58:08,840
Well, yes you could but don't think at this auction you could.

878
00:58:08,840 --> 00:58:09,840
Why not?

879
00:58:09,840 --> 00:58:12,840
What the fuck is wrong with this guy?

880
00:58:12,840 --> 00:58:15,840
I have a sinus infection.

881
00:58:15,840 --> 00:58:17,840
Oh, alright, I bet you do, yeah.

882
00:58:17,840 --> 00:58:22,840
Bitch. And that Volkswagen GTK. These would be excellent for-

883
00:58:22,840 --> 00:58:26,840
We have all the items are frozen as it stands. We can't add any more.

884
00:58:26,840 --> 00:58:28,840
I hid it with my freeze ray.

885
00:58:28,840 --> 00:58:29,840
You-

886
00:58:29,840 --> 00:58:31,840
You don't have a freeze ray.

887
00:58:31,840 --> 00:58:33,840
Whaaaaat?

888
00:58:33,840 --> 00:58:35,840
I just got a freeze ray.

889
00:58:35,840 --> 00:58:38,840
So, perhaps for another auction we could-

890
00:58:38,840 --> 00:58:41,840
Okay, I don't want to wait though, so just put it up there.

891
00:58:41,840 --> 00:58:47,680
it up there I need money now I just want roll a persuasion check okay

892
00:58:47,680 --> 00:58:56,160
Oh No seven he says I'm sorry sir and while you do look as sticks and like a

893
00:58:56,160 --> 00:59:01,600
distinguished guest with those black and white stripes I should be sarcastic

894
00:59:01,600 --> 00:59:05,800
right now I could have you thrown out of here I'm rolling rolled inside check to

895
00:59:05,800 --> 00:59:07,800
see if he's being sarcastic.

896
00:59:07,800 --> 00:59:11,660
Uh... 15.

897
00:59:11,660 --> 00:59:13,880
He's not, he's just sort of using it to fault answer.

898
00:59:13,880 --> 00:59:17,880
Can I roll to say that he's selling them for me?

899
00:59:17,880 --> 00:59:19,800
You can roll a deception check.

900
00:59:19,800 --> 00:59:20,800
Okay.

901
00:59:20,800 --> 00:59:22,120
But also, what's your goal?

902
00:59:22,120 --> 00:59:28,720
Well, my prison jumpsuit has a tuxedo drawn on it, so I'm hoping that tricks him.

903
00:59:28,720 --> 00:59:29,720
Into what?

904
00:59:29,720 --> 00:59:32,360
I'm gonna have him roll an insight to see if he can tell it's drawn on.

905
00:59:32,360 --> 00:59:38,880
all right I'm gonna roll deception 18 he can absolutely tell you're actually

906
00:59:38,880 --> 00:59:46,000
drawn on and then so but 18 plus 3 okay yeah so he he definitely believes that

907
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:51,120
you are selling the Jetta for him for you yeah but he does not think that's a

908
00:59:51,120 --> 00:59:55,560
tuxedo are the are the guests for the auction here yet they're gonna be

909
00:59:55,560 --> 01:00:02,120
trickling in oh yes I should mention that actually good call so something to

910
01:00:02,120 --> 01:00:06,800
note about this auction. I'll be keeping track of everything you do after this

911
01:00:06,800 --> 01:00:11,880
weird interaction with the auctioneer and I'm going to be asserting, assigning

912
01:00:11,880 --> 01:00:18,720
time values to it. That's not good. So I'll be letting you know what's going on.

913
01:00:18,720 --> 01:00:25,840
It's 830 now. The final, the time for the auction is gonna start at 950. So between

914
01:00:25,840 --> 01:00:30,600
now and... An hour and 20 minutes? Yeah but it's not gonna go that far. Let's watch Freddy

915
01:00:30,600 --> 01:00:39,120
got fingered very funny but yeah between now and 950 minutes so you I mean you

916
01:00:39,120 --> 01:00:43,280
guys are very early you're basically the first people at the cocktail hour which

917
01:00:43,280 --> 01:00:47,080
makes sense because you're also there on sort of like an official duty there are

918
01:00:47,080 --> 01:00:54,520
other Jollibee guards around you and but with you'll sort of see who's gonna

919
01:00:54,520 --> 01:01:00,700
to arrive and I will let you know every every sort of time stamp like what's

920
01:01:00,700 --> 01:01:03,460
happening so based on what you're doing I'm going to be keeping track we have a

921
01:01:03,460 --> 01:01:07,700
little time okay yes you have time so one of you right now this is this is

922
01:01:07,700 --> 01:01:11,580
sort of outside the realm of time this one of you guard guard the artifacts

923
01:01:11,580 --> 01:01:16,140
that we're supposed to guard one of you take care of Sullivan the frog and I'm

924
01:01:16,140 --> 01:01:20,060
gonna stand by the front door and ask the auction guests if they want to buy

925
01:01:20,060 --> 01:01:24,700
this car for $10 wait wait wait hold on wait can we play out what happened

926
01:01:24,700 --> 01:01:28,900
because I wanted to sell the car and he's selling it for me yeah I mean I got

He starts a little quiescing about like, "Oh, just like when my wife left me, another missed opportunity."

954
01:04:03,540 --> 01:04:04,660
God fucking damn it.

I'll just try to roll with whatever it is you're rolling.

971
01:05:09,140 --> 01:05:10,140
That's a really good idea.

972
01:05:10,140 --> 01:05:12,140
That sounds crazy pants.

973
01:05:12,140 --> 01:05:14,140
I'll have to like hold my tongue.

974
01:05:14,140 --> 01:05:18,140
Anyway, so you're, yeah, you see Pennsylvania Jim walk in.

975
01:05:18,140 --> 01:05:24,860
Behind him you see sort of a foppish looking man with like just a giant

976
01:05:24,860 --> 01:05:31,420
rosacea nose. All of you roll a history check just to see if you know who this guy

977
01:05:31,420 --> 01:05:34,940
is. You feel like you've seen him before.

978
01:05:34,940 --> 01:05:45,300
8. 23 or 22 sorry. 15. Patrick Yoda and William Johnson you know who this is.

979
01:05:45,300 --> 01:05:49,920

01:05:57,960 --> 01:06:02,460
collector archaeologists and professors and adventurers we know this is one of

982
01:06:02,460 --> 01:06:10,140
the most prominent collectors and likely Leo the collectors rival Gerard de poopoo

983
01:06:10,140 --> 01:06:12,400
(laughter)

984
01:06:12,400 --> 01:06:14,680
- A famous...

985
01:06:14,680 --> 01:06:16,500
(laughter)

986
01:06:16,500 --> 01:06:19,100
You see him walking with Pennsylvania Jim,

987
01:06:19,100 --> 01:06:22,240
as if, so, seems like Jim is his treasure hunter,

988
01:06:22,240 --> 01:06:24,580
almost to his collector.

989
01:06:24,580 --> 01:06:25,500
You see them walking in.

990
01:06:25,500 --> 01:06:30,500
You see Pennsylvania Jim recognizes U3 right away.

991
01:06:30,500 --> 01:06:32,980
And he sort of walks up to you, says,

992
01:06:32,980 --> 01:06:34,260
oh, hey, what's going on guys?

993
01:06:34,260 --> 01:06:35,100
I thought you were--

994
01:06:35,100 --> 01:06:36,620
- Shut up, bitch!

995
01:06:36,620 --> 01:06:38,340
- All right, okay, Dwight.

996
01:06:38,340 --> 01:06:40,340
I'm not Dwight, I'm Patrick.

997
01:06:40,340 --> 01:06:41,340
I'm just sorry.

998
01:06:41,340 --> 01:06:45,340
I will admit this, not to side with Jim, you're being kind of a Dwight today.

999
01:06:45,340 --> 01:06:46,340
I'm not being a Dwight.

1000
01:06:46,340 --> 01:06:47,340
You're being a bit of a Dwight.

1001
01:06:47,340 --> 01:06:48,340
I hope I'm not.

1002
01:06:48,340 --> 01:06:50,340
Dwight is just something I've coined.

1003
01:06:50,340 --> 01:06:53,340
Something I call people who are just kind of, you know.

1004
01:06:53,340 --> 01:06:55,340
And he makes that face.

1005
01:06:55,340 --> 01:06:56,340
Yeah, and I glare.

1006
01:06:56,340 --> 01:06:59,340
He just looks out the window and makes that face.

1007
01:06:59,340 --> 01:07:02,340
You see a Lakitu holding a camera?

1008
01:07:02,340 --> 01:07:06,340
I'm snapping in his face.

1009
01:07:06,340 --> 01:07:10,940
(laughter)

1010
01:07:10,940 --> 01:07:13,340
I started snapping in his face, I'm trying to...

1011
01:07:13,340 --> 01:07:16,140
"Hey, you're looking out the window again."

1012
01:07:16,140 --> 01:07:20,140
I went to Brown and I love the CIA, you can't make me do anything.

1013
01:07:20,140 --> 01:07:23,340
"Hey, that's a veiny gym, you're making the face in the window."

1014
01:07:23,340 --> 01:07:29,640
You see Gerard Depoupou, he goes, "Oh, so this is the...

1015
01:07:29,640 --> 01:07:34,140
These are the treasure haunted hills that Leo has howled."

1016
01:07:34,140 --> 01:07:34,640
What?

1017
01:07:34,640 --> 01:07:35,640
*laughter*

1018
01:07:35,640 --> 01:07:36,640
What did you say?

1019
01:07:36,640 --> 01:07:37,640
I sound like a motel.

1020
01:07:37,640 --> 01:07:39,640
Speak English, you motherfucker!

1021
01:07:39,640 --> 01:07:40,640
This...

1022
01:07:40,640 --> 01:07:43,140
accent will be better when I'm less...

1023
01:07:43,140 --> 01:07:43,640
DRUNK.

1024
01:07:43,640 --> 01:07:45,640
*laughter*

1025
01:07:45,640 --> 01:07:46,640
Next session.

1026
01:07:46,640 --> 01:07:47,640
*mimics the accent*

1027
01:07:47,640 --> 01:07:52,640
I see you are here to auction, and you have this little frog, man.

1028
01:07:52,640 --> 01:07:53,640
Er, hi there.

1029
01:07:53,640 --> 01:07:55,640
I'm a Yoda, not a frog.

1030
01:07:55,640 --> 01:07:57,140
I wasn't talking to you.

1031
01:07:57,140 --> 01:07:58,140
Well then I...

1032
01:07:58,140 --> 01:08:00,140
I'm sorry for interrupting.

1033
01:08:00,140 --> 01:08:01,640
That's okay.

1034
01:08:01,640 --> 01:08:05,080
It's the first time you've ever apologized to me for interrupting.

1035
01:08:05,080 --> 01:08:08,080
I apologize for all the other interruptions.

1036
01:08:08,080 --> 01:08:10,920
This is a serious breakthrough.

1037
01:08:10,920 --> 01:08:12,320
I could cry.

1038
01:08:12,320 --> 01:08:21,600
We're making progress together as player and DM.

1039
01:08:21,600 --> 01:08:26,640
You see Jim say, uh, uh, Jim sort of, uh, Pennsylvania Jim looks at you all and says,

1040
01:08:26,640 --> 01:08:31,640
Well, if you guys are here, I assume Leo, I guess, needs your help.

1041
01:08:31,640 --> 01:08:35,240
No, no, we're just here.

1042
01:08:35,240 --> 01:08:37,540
We're just here because we like to be here.

1043
01:08:37,540 --> 01:08:40,140
Who's Leo the collector?

1044
01:08:40,140 --> 01:08:42,140
Never heard that name.

1045
01:08:42,140 --> 01:08:44,240
Yeah, who the fuck is Leo the collector?

1046
01:08:44,240 --> 01:08:52,040
Jim looks right at the camera and Jor-El De-Pu-Pu says, I believe we will take our seats now.

Loved prison and we move on to uh, what are you doing?

1069
01:11:01,120 --> 01:11:05,140
So I am just following the hors d'oeuvres guy around

1070
01:11:06,100 --> 01:11:11,300
I'm a little Yoda, but the hors d'oeuvres guy is like a giant troll.

1071
01:11:11,300 --> 01:11:12,700
He is a giant troll.

1072
01:11:12,700 --> 01:11:16,700
He has like a Costco sample-sized plate of hors d'oeuvres.

1073
01:11:16,700 --> 01:11:18,500
Do you want an hors d'oeuvres?

1074
01:11:18,500 --> 01:11:20,500
And I'm jumping up like, "Ahh!"

1075
01:11:20,500 --> 01:11:21,500
[Laughter]

1076
01:11:21,500 --> 01:11:24,500
"I want the shrimp carton up!"

1077
01:11:24,500 --> 01:11:26,500
"I want the snails and bacon!"

1078
01:11:26,500 --> 01:11:30,500
"I wouldn't normally do this, but we need to save some for the other guests."

1079
01:11:30,500 --> 01:11:34,500
"Oh, come on! I ain't fucking hungry down here! I got a little yoga stomach!"

1080
01:11:34,500 --> 01:11:37,780
I have a little yellow stomach! Come on! Give me the fuckin' food!

1081
01:11:37,780 --> 01:11:39,300
Okay, okay, okay.

1082
01:11:39,300 --> 01:11:43,460
If you have a ye-little stomach, I feel like you would like- you'd want less.

1083
01:11:43,460 --> 01:11:44,740
Don't tell him that.

1084
01:11:44,740 --> 01:11:48,340
Roll a, uh, persuasion check.

1085
01:11:48,340 --> 01:11:50,100
See if he can give you more hors d'oeuvres.

1086
01:11:50,100 --> 01:11:52,100
Yeah, that's an eight.

1087
01:11:52,100 --> 01:11:53,620
[Laughter]

1088
01:11:53,620 --> 01:11:58,980
He says, "Look, I-I-I-I can give you one more shrimp, but after that I have to cut you off."

1089
01:11:58,980 --> 01:11:59,780
How big's the shrimp?

1090
01:11:59,780 --> 01:12:02,340
Shrimp-sized.

1091
01:12:03,860 --> 01:12:04,860
Jumbo!

1092
01:12:04,860 --> 01:12:05,860
No, sorry.

1093
01:12:05,860 --> 01:12:06,860
Fuck!

1094
01:12:06,860 --> 01:12:07,860
Okay, well that's fine.

1095
01:12:07,860 --> 01:12:08,860
I'll take it.

1096
01:12:08,860 --> 01:12:10,860
And you want to look at the artifacts?

1097
01:12:10,860 --> 01:12:11,860
Yeah.

1098
01:12:11,860 --> 01:12:15,860
Yeah, okay, so you go over to, so you want to go to the storeroom in that case, yeah.

1099
01:12:15,860 --> 01:12:19,860
You walk out to the hallway area to see the storeroom.

1100
01:12:19,860 --> 01:12:22,860
You see it's a pretty bland hallway, blowtoss.

1101
01:12:22,860 --> 01:12:25,860
Let me make sure I'm doing this right.

1102
01:12:25,860 --> 01:12:26,860
Okay, cool.

1103
01:12:26,860 --> 01:12:32,860
So yeah, you walk out to the hallway and you see some kitchen staff walking around.

1104
01:12:32,860 --> 01:12:38,900
around, you see some appraisers sort of coming in and out of rooms. You see the

1105
01:12:38,900 --> 01:12:45,340
artifact room as well, and you see like a jolly b guard outside of it, and

1106
01:12:45,340 --> 01:12:50,860
I mean you tell him, you get you at this point you're a part of the, they know

1107
01:12:50,860 --> 01:12:54,540
you as a part of Leo's crew. So you're able to go in there, so you're able to see some of the

1108
01:12:54,540 --> 01:12:59,060
artifacts. Can he go in there with impunity or does he get followed? What's

1109
01:12:59,060 --> 01:13:03,100
impunity mean that I know what are you doing

1110
01:13:03,100 --> 01:13:08,060
yeah he's right so you see the art of the artifacts all seem fine right there all

1111
01:13:08,060 --> 01:13:08,700
there

1112
01:13:08,700 --> 01:13:13,900
they're all there on like a table yes ok so I put the car keys next to them

1113
01:13:13,900 --> 01:13:19,140

1114
01:13:19,140 --> 01:13:22,580
the kids unstoppable today god fuck fuck you

1115
01:13:22,580 --> 01:13:26,100
I'm not even gonna make you roll for that

1116
01:13:26,100 --> 01:13:28,100
It's just too smart.

1117
01:13:28,100 --> 01:13:30,100
I can't do that.

1118
01:13:30,100 --> 01:13:34,100
He's not outsmarting your characters, he's outsmarting you.

1119
01:13:34,100 --> 01:13:36,100
Yeah, he literally... fuck man.

1120
01:13:36,100 --> 01:13:38,100
I thought you were gonna do a thing.

1121
01:13:38,100 --> 01:13:40,100
Okay, amazing. Yeah.

1122
01:13:40,100 --> 01:13:42,100
The car keys are there.

1123
01:13:42,100 --> 01:13:44,100
It's not even a question.

1124
01:13:44,100 --> 01:13:46,100
Okay, I go back and I get drunk with keys.

1125
01:13:46,100 --> 01:13:50,100
Put the car keys on the table.

1126
01:13:50,100 --> 01:13:52,100
You go out, back out there, you're getting drunk.

1127
01:13:52,100 --> 01:13:54,100
Okay, cool.

1128
01:13:54,100 --> 01:13:59,340
845 at this point so now you start to see more guests coming in so it's a new

1129
01:13:59,340 --> 01:14:07,200
timestamp. Who are some of the guests? One of the people that you see is which one

1130
01:14:07,200 --> 01:14:12,100
of you mentioned that you dated your your student? I think it was you both? I think me and

1131
01:14:12,100 --> 01:14:19,260
Caleb both said that. I didn't date these hoes. You both see the girl that you

1132
01:14:19,260 --> 01:14:27,780
dated long ago or whatever it is you did. Marie Stain and she comes in and she

1133
01:14:27,780 --> 01:14:36,860
looks as ravishing and as student-like as ever. I don't remember her face but

She's like, "Oh, well."

1147
01:15:35,460 --> 01:15:38,460
Just like old times.

1148
01:15:38,460 --> 01:15:41,460
I walk by while I'm following the hors d'oeuvres stroll,

1149
01:15:41,460 --> 01:15:44,460
and I look at Blotas, and I say,

1150
01:15:44,460 --> 01:15:47,460
"Ah, that old Irish whisperer."

1151
01:15:47,460 --> 01:15:50,460
As he's throwing up.

1152
01:15:50,460 --> 01:15:58,940
Well, I'd like to... she's like wiping vomit off her shirt. I'd like to introduce you to my bodyguard, Rex.

1153

1154
01:16:10,220 --> 01:16:15,740

1155
01:16:15,740 --> 01:16:18,260
Um, is he here to help me with the auction?

1156

I'm looking forward to getting something of some use, you know.

1157
01:16:21,260 --> 01:16:25,100
Back in the day when we were, I was just your students, both of your students

1158
01:16:25,100 --> 01:16:28,620
in your co-teaching class, we both taught together.

1159
01:16:28,620 --> 01:16:29,220
I remember that.

1160
01:16:29,220 --> 01:16:31,340

1161
01:16:31,340 --> 01:16:33,580

01:16:41,060 --> 01:16:44,460
And now I'm a collector and a Catherine Hepburn impersonator as well.

1164
01:16:44,460 --> 01:16:46,060
(laughing)

1165
01:16:46,060 --> 01:16:49,540
- But it is good to see you both.

1166
01:16:49,540 --> 01:16:51,260

1169
01:16:54,380 --> 01:16:56,180

1170
01:16:56,180 --> 01:16:58,600

1171
01:16:58,600 --> 01:17:01,620

1172
01:17:01,620 --> 01:17:03,220
(laughing)

1173
01:17:03,220 --> 01:17:05,440

01:17:09,980 --> 01:17:13,900
- 14.

1177
01:17:13,900 --> 01:17:17,900
She says, "Rex, make sure this guy gets a hors d'oeuvre."

1178
01:17:17,900 --> 01:17:18,740
He goes, "Yeah."

1179
01:17:18,740 --> 01:17:19,580
- Yay!

1180
01:17:19,580 --> 01:17:20,400
(laughing)

1181
01:17:20,400 --> 01:17:23,940
- "All right, I'll make sure that you get that."

1182
01:17:23,940 --> 01:17:26,900
And you see Rex goes over to the hors d'oeuvres guy

1183
01:17:26,900 --> 01:17:28,500
and like taps him on the shoulder and goes,

1184
01:17:28,500 --> 01:17:33,140
"Yeah, can we get a shrimp cocktail

1185
01:17:33,140 --> 01:17:37,140
for this little green guy over here?"

1186
01:17:37,140 --> 01:17:38,300
- No, tell him it's me!

1187
01:17:38,300 --> 01:17:39,300
(laughing)

1188
01:17:39,300 --> 01:17:40,860
- "I guess just for me then."

1189
01:17:40,860 --> 01:17:42,020
(laughing)

1190
01:17:42,020 --> 01:17:44,300
And she says, "What are you guys here for?"

1191
01:17:44,300 --> 01:17:45,700
We go back to the bar.

1192
01:17:45,700 --> 01:17:47,820
She's asking you what you guys are here for.

1193
01:17:47,820 --> 01:17:51,280
- I'm chilling, man, what about you?

1194
01:17:51,280 --> 01:17:52,420
- I throw up again.

1195
01:17:52,420 --> 01:17:57,980
She says, "Ah, just what I thought,

1196
01:17:57,980 --> 01:18:01,180
"as evasive and strange as ever.

1197
01:18:01,180 --> 01:18:04,480
"Well, I have to go back to my bodyguard

1198
01:18:04,480 --> 01:18:05,580
"to make sure he's okay.

1199
01:18:05,580 --> 01:18:07,100
"He does miss me when I'm gone."

1200
01:18:07,100 --> 01:18:09,600
- Yo, check this out, Blowtiles can do the worm.

1201
01:18:09,600 --> 01:18:10,500

1202
01:18:10,500 --> 01:18:11,340

1269
01:24:00,900 --> 01:24:03,900
And I dash out of the room into the hallway.

01:25:29,820 --> 01:25:36,380
Yeah, you're sort of like surveying the area trying to get a sense of what's going on right now. There's nothing that's too suspicious

1288
01:25:36,380 --> 01:25:38,800
but

1289
01:25:38,800 --> 01:25:41,780

01:25:56,520 --> 01:26:00,500
Woody Harrelson admits to taking the virginity of a high school girl when he

1294
01:26:00,500 --> 01:26:08,820
was like 40 and yeah it cuts back to the hallway yeah what do you guys want to do

1295
01:26:08,820 --> 01:26:13,380
so you certainly can like try to understand where the noise is coming

1296
01:26:13,380 --> 01:26:17,300
from or you can just generally investigate or yeah I'm looking for

1297
01:26:17,300 --> 01:26:22,400
clues personally yeah I'm gonna follow Cameron around I'm looking for clues but

1298
01:26:22,400 --> 01:26:27,160
in an archaeological way and not a detective way that's right okay yeah so

1299
01:26:27,160 --> 01:26:31,920
roll a investigation check all right do I have to roll too because I said I was

1300
01:26:31,920 --> 01:26:35,480
doing yeah roll roll as well you can sort of help them out here very old

1301
01:26:35,480 --> 01:26:45,160
clues 18 you got a 5 I got an 18 okay with that 18 blowtoss you sort of have

1302
01:26:45,160 --> 01:26:48,760
like an inkling you think like you know what buildings like these and you sort

1303
01:26:48,760 --> 01:26:55,520
of like put your ear to the wall and you hear like sort of like footsteps in like

1304
01:26:55,520 --> 01:26:59,760
a vent like you start to get the sense that there is people maybe in like a

1305
01:26:59,760 --> 01:27:04,360
ventilation system like okay like you get that real hard oh can I send my

1306
01:27:04,360 --> 01:27:09,000
monkey into the vent absolutely you can

1307
01:27:11,400 --> 01:27:14,120
He didn't actually get drunk like the game said.

1308
01:27:14,120 --> 01:27:17,880
So you roll in, you run into one of the rooms,

1309
01:27:17,880 --> 01:27:21,000
one of the conference rooms, there's nobody in there,

1310
01:27:21,000 --> 01:27:24,840
and you see a vent up top, you pop it open,

1311
01:27:24,840 --> 01:27:28,320
and you toss in Patrick Monkey

1312
01:27:28,320 --> 01:27:31,720
up in there.

1313
01:27:31,720 --> 01:27:35,880
Hmm, this is interesting. I guess I have to roll for Patrick Monkey now.

1314
01:27:35,880 --> 01:27:39,160
Let me do that.

1315
01:27:39,160 --> 01:27:46,560
Yeah, Patrick monkey sort of scours around he looks for clues and stuff and he sees that somebody was definitely up there and he scroll

1316
01:27:46,560 --> 01:27:48,560
He's he goes

1317
01:27:48,560 --> 01:27:57,400
And he sort of like makes his body look exactly like another person kind of thing like a cartoon yeah like Jafar literally

1318
01:27:57,400 --> 01:28:01,680
He sort of like communicates that to you

1319
01:28:01,680 --> 01:28:05,480
But you don't know where they're going or like how long they've been in there

1320
01:28:05,480 --> 01:28:08,040
You're just getting the sense that like people are in the fucking vents

1321
01:28:08,920 --> 01:28:11,160
We cut back to the

1322
01:28:11,160 --> 01:28:17,920
Auction house way William Johnson. You're just like pleasantly smiling and like getting drunker and drunker

1323
01:28:17,920 --> 01:28:20,540
Sit yelling bigger and bigger numbers

1324
01:28:20,540 --> 01:28:23,160
one million dollars

1325
01:28:23,160 --> 01:28:31,760
Here the masters to the cabbie song the master recordings to the cabbie song and

1326
01:28:31,760 --> 01:28:35,720
What cabbie song I

1327
01:28:35,720 --> 01:28:38,520
Don't want to sing it you want to sing it

1328
01:28:38,520 --> 01:28:41,240
Is it the mega 64? Yeah, but the one...

1329
01:28:41,240 --> 01:28:43,240
Oh, okay.

1330
01:28:43,240 --> 01:28:45,240
(laughter)

1331
01:28:45,240 --> 01:28:47,240
(singing)

1332
01:28:47,240 --> 01:28:49,240
(laughter)

1333
01:28:49,240 --> 01:28:54,240
And you see, yeah, and somebody buys that real fast.

1334
01:28:54,240 --> 01:29:01,240
And then the next one is, he says, "Special Edition Brickleberry Wavebird Controller."

1335
01:29:01,240 --> 01:29:03,240
(laughter)

1336
01:29:03,240 --> 01:29:05,240
And, um...

1337
01:29:05,240 --> 01:29:07,240
Just Mad Libs that joke.

1338
01:29:07,240 --> 01:29:14,020
And the yeah you guys are now sort of you guys hear the the the so you can you can

1339
01:29:14,020 --> 01:29:21,040
explore the the vents or you can sort of try to assess where it's going it's up to

1340
01:29:21,040 --> 01:29:25,720
you to what you guys want to do with that information. But yeah obviously that's

1341
01:29:25,720 --> 01:29:30,680
like sort of the last auction option before the floppy disk. Well there's the

1342
01:29:30,680 --> 01:29:39,480
keys that I put on the second it buys us time right that's an extra action we can

1343
01:29:39,480 --> 01:29:45,240
take him like I gotta let you do that it was good role-playing and I try to

1344
01:29:45,240 --> 01:29:52,160
reward that as a DM okay yeah you see you see you see how the auctioneer goes

1345
01:29:52,160 --> 01:30:02,000
like uh and I I'm this is new I suppose and he realizes what it is like Volkswagen

1346
01:30:02,000 --> 01:30:06,640
Jetta keys starting muffled from the other room you just hear me yo one

1347
01:30:06,640 --> 01:30:14,400
brilliant yeah so that that does buy you guys time yes a couple more actions you

1348
01:30:14,400 --> 01:30:19,760
can do between now and the the final I'm a tiny guy yeah oh I want to can I throw

1349
01:30:19,760 --> 01:30:22,200
- Yeah, so he throws me into the vents.

1350
01:30:22,200 --> 01:30:23,040
- Absolutely, that happens.

1351
01:30:23,040 --> 01:30:24,920
- So I follow, okay.

1352
01:30:24,920 --> 01:30:28,920
So I follow whoever is in the vents.

1353
01:30:28,920 --> 01:30:30,960
- Okay, yeah, so roll a perception check.

1354
01:30:30,960 --> 01:30:34,920
- Nice, I'm gonna add your perception.

1355
01:30:34,920 --> 01:30:36,000
I think your perception's pretty good.

1356
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:38,440
I think you probably got an 18 right now.

1357
01:30:38,440 --> 01:30:39,980
- Yeah, my perception is plus eight.

1358
01:30:39,980 --> 01:30:41,000
- Yeah, oh fuck.

1359
01:30:41,000 --> 01:30:42,960
Okay, you got 21, okay, nice.

1360
01:30:42,960 --> 01:30:46,600
You quickly pick up on, using your Yoda ears,

1361
01:30:46,600 --> 01:30:47,640
they're like, peep, peep.

1362
01:30:47,640 --> 01:30:49,400
They like tweak a little bit.

1363
01:30:49,400 --> 01:30:53,200
you hear sort of the traces of somebody.

1364
01:30:53,200 --> 01:30:54,520
Somebody's out of the vent,

1365
01:30:54,520 --> 01:30:56,000
but you get the sense of where they are

1366
01:30:56,000 --> 01:30:57,760
using sort of like the force a little bit.

1367
01:30:57,760 --> 01:30:59,520
And you quickly like sort of scurry over

1368
01:30:59,520 --> 01:31:00,840
into that direction.

1369
01:31:00,840 --> 01:31:04,240
And you look below you now,

1370
01:31:04,240 --> 01:31:05,320
you sort of like get the sense,

1371
01:31:05,320 --> 01:31:07,400
okay, the trail is stopped.

1372
01:31:07,400 --> 01:31:09,800
And you see a grate below you.

1373
01:31:09,800 --> 01:31:14,400
And below that, you see two people,

1374
01:31:14,400 --> 01:31:17,840
well you think at least,

1375
01:31:17,840 --> 01:31:20,840
in sort of like black ninja garb.

1376
01:31:20,840 --> 01:31:25,340
Oh, no, and they seem to be in a room and you're guessing

1377
01:31:25,340 --> 01:31:28,040
because you went up a little bit on the top of the masks

1378
01:31:28,040 --> 01:31:28,940
the balcony.

1379
01:31:28,940 --> 01:31:37,940
The balcony floor.

1380
01:31:37,940 --> 01:31:41,240
He says that out loud and I just hear it echo back down

1381
01:31:41,240 --> 01:31:41,640
the mat.

1382
01:31:41,640 --> 01:31:44,340
I hear a whisper come on the go PJ Masks.

1383
01:31:47,540 --> 01:31:48,820
So what do you want to do?

1384
01:31:48,820 --> 01:31:49,820
Um...

1385
01:31:49,820 --> 01:31:58,660
He's not reading his buying time.

1386
01:31:58,660 --> 01:32:05,260
He's just looking at the paper going, "Uh huh, yeah."

1387
01:32:05,260 --> 01:32:11,980
Because if I use the force, if I use the force in the vent, then I could jump down and have

1388
01:32:11,980 --> 01:32:12,980
an advantage.

1389
01:32:12,980 --> 01:32:13,980
Yeah, definitely.

1390
01:32:13,980 --> 01:32:14,980
And attack them.

1391
01:32:14,980 --> 01:32:18,860
But if I use Yoda's mind, I can read their minds.

1392
01:32:18,860 --> 01:32:19,860
You should use Yoda's mind.

1393
01:32:19,860 --> 01:32:23,820
Nobody else is with you, so you'll probably get your ass kicked.

1394
01:32:23,820 --> 01:32:24,820
So Yoda's mind.

1395
01:32:24,820 --> 01:32:26,140
I'm going to use Yoda's mind.

1396
01:32:26,140 --> 01:32:27,620
So they will roll against...

1397
01:32:27,620 --> 01:32:28,940
You have a DC of I think...

1398
01:32:28,940 --> 01:32:29,940
What is it?

1399
01:32:29,940 --> 01:32:30,940
18?

1400
01:32:30,940 --> 01:32:31,940
What does that say?

1401
01:32:31,940 --> 01:32:32,940
Up top.

1402
01:32:32,940 --> 01:32:33,940
It should be on the top of your sheet.

1403
01:32:33,940 --> 01:32:34,940
Armor class?

1404
01:32:34,940 --> 01:32:35,940
No, your DC.

1405
01:32:35,940 --> 01:32:37,500
On top of your magic spells sheet I made you.

1406
01:32:37,500 --> 01:32:38,500
Oh, okay.

1407
01:32:38,500 --> 01:32:39,500
I have a DC of 16.

1408
01:32:39,500 --> 01:32:40,500
Okay, cool.

1409
01:32:40,500 --> 01:32:42,020
So they're going to roll against that to see if they can resist.

1410
01:32:42,020 --> 01:32:43,460
So do I roll too?

1411
01:32:43,460 --> 01:32:44,460
No, you don't roll.

1412
01:32:44,460 --> 01:32:45,460
Okay.

1413
01:32:45,460 --> 01:32:46,460
Okay.

1414
01:32:46,460 --> 01:32:47,460
You read their mind.

1415
01:32:47,460 --> 01:32:48,460
Oh, I do.

1416
01:32:48,460 --> 01:32:49,460
Oh, okay.

1417
01:32:49,460 --> 01:32:50,460
So, with Yoda's mind, you're able to peer into their mind.

1418
01:32:50,460 --> 01:32:51,460
You get the surface level thoughts before going deeper in.

1419
01:32:51,460 --> 01:32:52,460
Yeah.

1420
01:32:52,460 --> 01:32:53,460
You hear something that is not, you hear a couple of things.

1421
01:32:53,460 --> 01:32:54,460
You hear, "Gungan."

1422
01:32:54,460 --> 01:32:55,460
I don't know if they're gungan.

1423
01:32:55,460 --> 01:32:56,460
But what I can, actually, role perception.

1424
01:32:56,460 --> 01:32:57,460
You're hearing something in another language, which is a different language.

1425
01:32:57,460 --> 01:32:58,460
So, you're hearing something in another language, which is a different language.

1426
01:32:58,460 --> 01:32:59,460
You're hearing something in another language, which is a different language.

1427
01:32:59,460 --> 01:33:00,460
You're hearing something in another language, which is a different language.

1428
01:33:00,460 --> 01:33:01,460
You're hearing something in another language, which is a different language.

1429
01:33:01,460 --> 01:33:02,460
You're hearing something in another language, which is a different language.

1430
01:33:02,460 --> 01:33:02,960
here.

1431
01:33:02,960 --> 01:33:06,860
I don't know they're gungan.

1432
01:33:06,860 --> 01:33:12,660
But what what I can actually roll perception

1433
01:33:12,660 --> 01:33:14,360
because you're hearing something in another language,

1434
01:33:14,360 --> 01:33:18,060
which is not as illustrative, but 17 plus.

1435
01:33:18,060 --> 01:33:20,660
17 plus 8.

1436
01:33:20,660 --> 01:33:21,460
Oh, okay.

1437
01:33:21,460 --> 01:33:25,860
Despite you not understanding the language and reading those

1438
01:33:25,860 --> 01:33:27,160
surface level thoughts.

1439
01:33:27,160 --> 01:33:29,760
It's malintent.

1440
01:33:29,760 --> 01:33:30,760
You sense.

1441
01:33:30,860 --> 01:33:32,860
You definitely get a fucking vibe there.

1442
01:33:32,860 --> 01:33:33,360
Yeah.

1443
01:33:33,360 --> 01:33:37,360
It's it's it's they are dressed in Ninja Garb for a reason this

1444
01:33:37,360 --> 01:33:37,960
time.

1445
01:33:37,960 --> 01:33:39,760
Not like your birthday party.

1446
01:33:39,760 --> 01:33:41,660
Were you attached?

1447
01:33:41,660 --> 01:33:43,660
Not like my PJ Masks birthday party.

1448
01:33:43,660 --> 01:33:48,860
Yeah, so you can certainly try to probe deeper.

1449
01:33:48,860 --> 01:33:50,060
Can I?

1450
01:33:50,060 --> 01:33:50,860
Okay.

1451
01:33:50,860 --> 01:33:55,360
To get like exact words, but that said, you got the sense that

1452
01:33:55,360 --> 01:33:56,660
it was a different language.

1453
01:33:56,660 --> 01:34:00,360
Because Cameron, I'm in the vent so Cameron could jump through

1454
01:34:00,360 --> 01:34:06,520
the door and the camera guy could confront them or blow toss rather so

1455
01:34:06,520 --> 01:34:13,840
you're pretty far away uh-huh you could crawl back to get him to come but I can't

1456
01:34:13,840 --> 01:34:17,120
say not a good idea I know okay so for sure they won't lose them if you do

1457
01:34:17,120 --> 01:34:25,760
yeah so I guess I guess you probe deeper okay they're gonna resist again okay

1458
01:34:27,160 --> 01:34:29,160
Shit, they get the same roll.

1459
01:34:29,160 --> 01:34:31,160
You hear...

1460
01:34:31,160 --> 01:34:35,160
Because it's still in a language you don't understand.

1461
01:34:35,160 --> 01:34:37,160
Yeah. But roll a perception

1462
01:34:37,160 --> 01:34:39,160
with advantage now.

1463
01:34:39,160 --> 01:34:41,160
17. Roll again. 20.

1464
01:34:41,160 --> 01:34:43,160
Nat 20 or dirty 20?

1465
01:34:43,160 --> 01:34:45,160
Nat 20. For real?

1466
01:34:45,160 --> 01:34:47,160
Yeah, I saw it. He's not lying.

1467
01:34:47,160 --> 01:34:51,160
But for some inexplicable

1468
01:34:51,160 --> 01:34:53,160
reason, despite a

1469
01:34:53,160 --> 01:34:55,160
language you don't understand, maybe it's something

1470
01:34:55,160 --> 01:35:00,840
with the force, some sort of like a deeper primordial connection to the to the

1471
01:35:00,840 --> 01:35:04,560
connection we all share with other living beings, you know they're trying to

1472
01:35:04,560 --> 01:35:10,040
steal that artifact. For fucking sure. And that is what they're here to do.

1473
01:35:10,040 --> 01:35:16,080
Hit them with the needler one time. That's a good idea. To do that, I will

1474
01:35:16,080 --> 01:35:21,920
mention, there is a grate above you. Okay, can we tell, do we know where the vents

1475
01:35:21,920 --> 01:35:29,720
our relation to the race thank you so meanwhile I'm in the auction room and I

1476
01:35:29,720 --> 01:35:35,360
say to the person next to me just drunk at my man I'm like that be humped a huh

1477
01:35:35,360 --> 01:35:47,960
they're like they're like I do say it is Wednesday that's a good boy and I'll

1478
01:35:47,960 --> 01:35:50,560
I'll have both of you, actually, no.

1479
01:35:50,560 --> 01:35:54,680
Yeah, both of you roll a perception check

1480
01:35:54,680 --> 01:35:59,320
to get a sense of your surroundings.

1481
01:35:59,320 --> 01:36:01,320
- 16.

1482
01:36:01,320 --> 01:36:04,840
- We'll get a, we'll sort of like,

1483
01:36:04,840 --> 01:36:05,680
square that a little differently.

1484
01:36:05,680 --> 01:36:07,120
- Oh, okay, all right, so it's six plus eight,

1485
01:36:07,120 --> 01:36:08,120
that's like 14?

1486
01:36:08,120 --> 01:36:10,200
- Yeah, I mean like, so you both get a,

1487
01:36:10,200 --> 01:36:12,160
so you both kinda know where you are.

1488
01:36:12,160 --> 01:36:13,000
- Okay.

1489
01:36:13,000 --> 01:36:16,200
- You know, blow toss, that Patrick Yoda,

1490
01:36:16,200 --> 01:36:20,320
So in relation to you, he sort of went to the other,

1491
01:36:20,320 --> 01:36:22,480
so four walls, right? - Yeah.

1492
01:36:22,480 --> 01:36:25,580
- He went to the wall, one of the walls near you,

1493
01:36:25,580 --> 01:36:28,600
like one of the walls adjacent to you.

1494
01:36:28,600 --> 01:36:30,160
- Yeah, so it's not like in the,

1495
01:36:30,160 --> 01:36:31,600
they're not like next to the auction room,

1496
01:36:31,600 --> 01:36:33,080
they're like near me still.

1497
01:36:33,080 --> 01:36:35,060
They're near the storage room?

1498
01:36:35,060 --> 01:36:37,260
- They're near one of, they're near the bathrooms,

1499
01:36:37,260 --> 01:36:39,280
but like, they're near the auction room

1500
01:36:39,280 --> 01:36:42,280
in that like, it's part of the balcony,

1501
01:36:42,280 --> 01:36:45,000
and it's one of the rooms off of the balcony,

1502
01:36:45,000 --> 01:36:49,880
but they're only like 35, 40 or so feet from you,

1503
01:36:49,880 --> 01:36:51,440
where you are.

1504
01:36:51,440 --> 01:36:54,360
And you, Patrick, you oughta have that sense as well.

1505
01:36:54,360 --> 01:36:57,680
Like you felt yourself make a turn, like a hard right.

1506
01:36:57,680 --> 01:36:59,360
So from whatever, like sort of like,

1507
01:36:59,360 --> 01:37:01,160
of like the square that you were in,

1508
01:37:01,160 --> 01:37:02,960
you were in one side of the square

1509
01:37:02,960 --> 01:37:04,400
and you went like sort of like

1510
01:37:04,400 --> 01:37:06,080
into another side of the square.

1511
01:37:06,080 --> 01:37:07,760
You could feel that, but you're not that far

1512
01:37:07,760 --> 01:37:10,200
into that other side, if that makes sense.

1513
01:37:10,200 --> 01:37:14,480
So like, you have a sense of where you are

1514
01:37:14,480 --> 01:37:17,880
and you know that they are trying to like jump down,

1515
01:37:17,880 --> 01:37:22,880
probably like they're gonna try to approach the items.

1516
01:37:22,880 --> 01:37:25,600
Like you went to- - Are they in the vents?

1517
01:37:25,600 --> 01:37:27,080
- No, they're down from the vents.

1518
01:37:27,080 --> 01:37:28,360
They're in the room.

1519
01:37:28,360 --> 01:37:30,960
But like you know that like- - It's been so long.

1520
01:37:30,960 --> 01:37:33,000
- Yeah, so you blow toss,

1521
01:37:33,000 --> 01:37:35,920
you're like on like the left side of where the auction house,

1522
01:37:35,920 --> 01:37:38,840
of where the auctioneer is and like the items.

1523
01:37:38,840 --> 01:37:40,760
And you are like on the wall,

1524
01:37:40,760 --> 01:37:43,040
right where the auctioneer is, like by the stage.

1525
01:37:43,040 --> 01:37:43,880
- Oh, okay.

1526
01:37:43,880 --> 01:37:50,920
it in the vent and they are above it in a room on the balcony okay so they're

1527
01:37:50,920 --> 01:37:56,360
there you can see that what they're what their idea might be to like like

1528
01:37:56,360 --> 01:38:03,840
apprehend it yeah okay is there any way we can commute communicate oh yeah wait

1529
01:38:03,840 --> 01:38:07,600
what can I just walk run into the auction room and yell there people start trying

1530
01:38:07,600 --> 01:38:13,120
to steal the artifact you absolutely okay yeah I'm gonna do that okay so you run

1531
01:38:13,120 --> 01:38:19,200
out and does he have to roll for that? No. Okay. Running out and rolling. Why are you trying to

1532
01:38:19,200 --> 01:38:24,880
sabotage me dude? I'm asking if... And you climbed up so he's right on the ground floor so what do

1533
01:38:24,880 --> 01:38:31,760
you say? Well I don't know they're ninjas and I guess I don't know with certainty that they're

1534
01:38:31,760 --> 01:38:34,400
trying to steal the thing. No you don't know almost any of this. Yeah. You said there's something weird going on.

1535
01:38:34,400 --> 01:38:40,160
Yeah. Guys there's something weird going on there's Jafar is in the vents and I think he's up to no good.

1536
01:38:41,040 --> 01:38:44,400
Don't listen to him, he's fucking drunk out of his mind.

1537
01:38:44,400 --> 01:38:45,400
What?

1538
01:38:45,400 --> 01:38:47,400
I am more sober than I have ever been.

1539
01:38:47,400 --> 01:38:52,360
So the auctioneer who's gotten kind of used to ignoring you is like, kind of taking notice

1540
01:38:52,360 --> 01:38:53,360
at this point only.

1541
01:38:53,360 --> 01:38:55,440
He is going to feel like an asshole.

1542
01:38:55,440 --> 01:38:58,880
He's like, Jafar is in the vents.

1543
01:38:58,880 --> 01:39:03,160
There's somebody in the vents and I have this weird feeling that they might be trying to

1544
01:39:03,160 --> 01:39:04,640
steal something.

1545
01:39:04,640 --> 01:39:07,480
And Patrick Yoda.

1546
01:39:07,480 --> 01:39:10,400
What happens now that he said that?

1547
01:39:10,400 --> 01:39:15,400
So, you see them perk up and start to move.

1548
01:39:15,400 --> 01:39:16,960
I'm gonna give you the opportunity,

1549
01:39:16,960 --> 01:39:19,400
because you got to jump on them, you were so stealthy,

1550
01:39:19,400 --> 01:39:20,760
I'm gonna give you the opportunity

1551
01:39:20,760 --> 01:39:23,200
to make a reaction of some kind.

1552
01:39:23,200 --> 01:39:27,280
So that can either be an attack, that can be a--

1553
01:39:27,280 --> 01:39:28,480
- Can I make them crap their pants?

1554
01:39:28,480 --> 01:39:29,920
- Trying to grapple them?

1555
01:39:29,920 --> 01:39:31,240
I don't know if you have that ability,

1556
01:39:31,240 --> 01:39:34,760
but you have the hot rod ability.

1557
01:39:34,760 --> 01:39:37,840
- I do have use of the force and Yoda's,

1558
01:39:37,840 --> 01:39:43,400
I think maybe, no, because Yoda's mind was the fourth, maybe the hoverboard?

1559
01:39:43,400 --> 01:39:44,400
Go for it.

1560
01:39:44,400 --> 01:39:48,960
So you can do a hoverboard attack, so you can bust through the gate, the grate, and do a

1561
01:39:48,960 --> 01:39:54,720
hoverboard attack before they bust out of the room.

1562
01:39:54,720 --> 01:39:56,440
I'm going to give you that option.

1563
01:39:56,440 --> 01:39:57,440
Okay.

1564
01:39:57,440 --> 01:40:01,840
So roll, it's going to be an attack roll, so you're going to add whatever your hoverboard

1565
01:40:01,840 --> 01:40:02,840
attack modifier is.

1566
01:40:02,840 --> 01:40:04,720
I can help you with that in a second.

1567
01:40:04,720 --> 01:40:06,720
That says attack bonus plus four.

1568
01:40:06,720 --> 01:40:07,720
Okay, go for it.

1569
01:40:07,720 --> 01:40:12,360
yeah that hits both of them roll for damage

1570
01:40:12,360 --> 01:40:19,080
ok it's not going to be the D20 that is 7. That's not the dice.

1571
01:40:19,080 --> 01:40:24,040
Check out those sheet. I should tell you. Which one is that?

1572
01:40:24,040 --> 01:40:28,720
So whatever the damage is. It says 1 D8.

1573
01:40:28,720 --> 01:40:33,000
ok there you go. Which one's D8? The one that looks like a triangle but not a

1574
01:40:33,000 --> 01:40:35,160
small triangle. Two triangles together.

1575
01:40:35,160 --> 01:40:35,660
Yeah.

1576
01:40:35,660 --> 01:40:37,260
That's her.

1577
01:40:37,260 --> 01:40:38,260
It's me.

1578
01:40:38,260 --> 01:40:38,960
Oh my God.

1579
01:40:38,960 --> 01:40:39,660
You're right.

1580
01:40:39,660 --> 01:40:40,760
I think you add to that too.

1581
01:40:40,760 --> 01:40:42,660
Yeah, that's a d8 plus one.

1582
01:40:42,660 --> 01:40:43,360
Okay, cool.

1583
01:40:43,360 --> 01:40:48,260
So you so here's what happens you see those guys start to like

1584
01:40:48,260 --> 01:40:49,760
they hear blowtoss go.

1585
01:40:49,760 --> 01:40:53,160
There's something weird going on and like they like sort of

1586
01:40:53,160 --> 01:40:55,360
look at each other and bust out of the room.

1587
01:40:55,360 --> 01:40:59,960
But before they do that you like stomp on the great and kick

1588
01:40:59,960 --> 01:41:01,260
your board down and it goes.

1589
01:41:03,060 --> 01:41:06,660
and hits both of them for nine points of damage

1590
01:41:06,660 --> 01:41:08,740
and they like fall out of the door

1591
01:41:08,740 --> 01:41:12,660
uh... and all of you will see is this

1592
01:41:12,660 --> 01:41:17,180
who sees this everybody or just me just you see the hit happened they all see

1593
01:41:17,180 --> 01:41:18,100
the guys

1594
01:41:18,100 --> 01:41:20,320
will like fall out of the door ok

1595
01:41:20,320 --> 01:41:23,240
uh... and all of you will roll for initiative

1596
01:41:23,240 --> 01:41:26,340
uh... about to be a fight

1597
01:41:26,340 --> 01:41:27,940
and uh... eleven

1598
01:41:27,940 --> 01:41:30,580
we can stop it there

1599
01:41:30,580 --> 01:41:31,580
Okay, well I got an 11.

1600
01:41:31,580 --> 01:41:32,580
We'll deliver that.

1601
01:41:32,580 --> 01:41:33,580
Maybe you want something more.

1602
01:41:33,580 --> 01:41:34,580
