1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,580
(upbeat music)

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:13,180
- How far you have come as the sync clapper on this show.

3
00:00:13,180 --> 00:00:17,640
You used to be a piece of shit when it came to the clap.

4
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:18,860
- No, I was good at it.

5
00:00:18,860 --> 00:00:21,600
- No, you might as well be drunk.

6
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:24,160
- I wish I was.

7
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:26,100
- Might as well have been, I mean in the past.

8
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:27,920
- You might as well have been drunk in the past

9
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:28,760
and now you are--

10
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:29,580
- When you clap.

11
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:34,580
my sober go. I wish I was completely drunk right now. Me too. Have we ever done a

12
00:00:34,580 --> 00:00:39,620
really drunk kind of? Yeah, we have. Yes. We've done them a lot. That was the

13
00:00:39,620 --> 00:00:47,580
entire first two years. Yeah. I'm pretty sure there's one episode where I went

14
00:00:47,580 --> 00:00:52,580
and we all visited. Oh, and we recorded at my countertop. Recorded at your

15
00:00:52,580 --> 00:00:56,700
countertop as soon as we got home. But even before that, we were, there were

16
00:00:56,700 --> 00:01:01,660
somewhere we're going pretty hard. It's good to get drunk at your job. There is

17
00:01:01,660 --> 00:01:06,980
one episode where I'm just completely blasted. Oh, that was one that we did

18
00:01:06,980 --> 00:01:11,780
with Thomas, yeah, and you, did you put an onion in your mouth? I bit an onion.

19
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:14,820
You bit an onion. We've talked about this. I remember that now. I'm trying to

20
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:17,980
think. There's a lot of D&Ds that I've done where I'm pretty hammered. Well,

21
00:01:17,980 --> 00:01:19,820
that's a different thing. That's a completely different thing. That's what

22
00:01:19,820 --> 00:01:23,540
you're supposed to do. You're supposed to get drunk in a new D&D. Drinking, yeah,

23
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:27,820
Exactly drinking and drunk drunking. I've done so much stand up where I'm like

24
00:01:27,820 --> 00:01:32,540
completely hammered. I don't do that back in the day back in the day. I was doing a

25
00:01:32,540 --> 00:01:37,100
lot of like I used to do. I used to watch movies and play video games while drunk

26
00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:41,020
back in the day, but really different now. Yeah, I'm never going to hurt us on

27
00:01:41,020 --> 00:01:44,380
the remember I was on the crackers and the pretzels recently. I would get a

28
00:01:44,380 --> 00:01:48,300
whole pitcher before I would host that open mic and I would drink out of the

29
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:53,100
pitcher liquid courage stage fright. Yeah, it was it was bad for a long time.

30
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:58,840
Yeah. Recently I've been wanting to get back to smoking weed again, but I don't

31
00:01:58,840 --> 00:01:59,640
think I'm going to.

32
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:00,140
Disgusting.

33
00:02:00,140 --> 00:02:01,260
It is disgusting.

34
00:02:01,260 --> 00:02:01,760
Gross.

35
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:08,800
Oh God, I want to every single day. I get home and I go, "Oh my God, weed would be

36
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:11,800
so amazing right now to watch Goodfellas and smoke weed as a toy."

37
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:16,300
I'm pretty purified from it, but every once in a while I get such a strong desire.

38
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:17,640
Weed is OD toy.

39
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:18,960
It is not OD.

40
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:20,300
It's OD toy.

41
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:21,960
Is OD good or is OD bad?

42
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:28,440
OD is depending on the context. It's like okay. OD means overdoing it. Like if you

43
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:32,320
say if someone's OD is like okay where it's in the middle where like for

44
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:35,320
example if you ask someone they want to do something and say okay that's good,

45
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:39,360
but if so you ask someone how was this and I say it was okay. I mean it's bad. I

46
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:45,040
think I finally I think I hit this is my year where I am just at a different

47
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:50,160
stage in life than young people and I cannot understand things like OD anymore.

48
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:51,160
you grew up.

49
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:52,160
OD is an old man thing.

50
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:56,720
No, I think this is, we hit the generational line.

51
00:02:56,720 --> 00:03:00,120
Where I don't have any clue what anybody younger than me is talking about.

52
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:04,600
The generational line for me, I can tell you exactly what it is.

53
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:05,600
Tell me.

54
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:06,600
What?

55
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:07,600
Five Nights at Freddy's.

56
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:08,600
Oh yeah.

57
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:09,720
See, I like Five Nights at Freddy's.

58
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:10,720
I like it.

59
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:12,200
I like Five Nights at Freddy's so much.

60
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:17,000
I remember so vividly that being the first thing where it would conceivably be something

61
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
I was interested in.

62
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,800
Oh, okay, this guy's too old to get scared.

63
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:24,100
yeah, but then afraid of horror. Oh, this is for kids. It's not for kids and

64
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:29,640
being being still a kid saying that it's for grown up. There's a lower that that

65
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:34,320
it goes back years. There's a years. Well, the game's been out for I don't

66
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:37,260
even know how long it's been out. The game's been out for ten years. Yeah, it

67
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:40,960
came out when we were like we were in high school. Yeah, I was in

68
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:46,540
probably probably fifteen when that came out. Yeah, I feel like I remember seven.

69
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:50,320
I feel like I remember that being the thing where I was like this. I this is

70
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:53,760
for children, even though I was still liking all the other stuff that was for

71
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:56,800
kids, but that was the first thing where I was like I'm too old. He liked all the

72
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:59,640
other stuff that was for kids like here comes the airplane.

73
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:04,400
You can still that's okay. It's still like a piece every night. Everyone you're

74
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:07,040
gonna not gonna do here comes the airplane. How else is it gonna get your

75
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:10,640
mouth? You still do uppies. How else am I gonna fucking get up? What are you

76
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:14,280
talking about? You are being an asshole. You sound crazy. Yeah, you're saying so

77
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:18,660
you're too old for you to get a plan of peace. I'm a little bit. So let me get

78
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:22,220
the straight. I don't you bring your face to the plate. You don't bring the

79
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:26,140
food to your mouth. Yeah, this makes no say don't like a pig. If I don't hear

80
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:30,360
I don't use a fork, I just use my fingers and I grab so here I grab a

81
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:32,060
piece of corn like this. I

82
00:04:32,060 --> 00:04:38,260
or here comes a comet. Here comes comment and asteroid or you could say

83
00:04:38,260 --> 00:04:42,060
here comes Santa and his reindeer. Any of this works, but instead you decide to

84
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:46,900
I'm too grown for that. You're not grown at all. You are not grown. I'm grown.

85
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:50,600
You are not grown yet. You're not grown. I'm completely grown. Guys, we had,

86
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:52,900
and I didn't want to talk about this, but they're making me.

87
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:56,700
We had an office drama this morning. We did have an office drama.

88
00:04:56,700 --> 00:04:59,500
We had an office drama this morning. I

89
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:04,900
had to put in a ticket. I had to put in a ticket in our work.

90
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:09,700
At the poop factory. Our work zen desk. He had to clock into the poop factory.

91
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:13,900
because I did not have any toilet paper and I was trying to bust a nut at work,

92
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:19,540
but I could not. I had no where to put it. That bathroom is so dirty right now.

93
00:05:19,540 --> 00:05:24,220
It's pretty bad. Yeah, it's got paint all in it. Yeah, it looks like a

94
00:05:24,220 --> 00:05:28,260
squatter's home right now. I cleaned the last paint bathroom, so I'm off to

95
00:05:28,260 --> 00:05:31,540
clean this one. Don't worry. Don't worry. Patrick won't clean anything,

96
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:34,620
so I'll have to do it. Me and Patrick, as a result of having to go buy

97
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:38,580
toilet paper for Caleb, me and Patrick actually came up with something rather

98
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:42,540
it's funny yeah, which will save this situation from being purely negative

99
00:05:42,540 --> 00:05:47,460
intense. So basically going to buy toilet paper and you go up to the to the

100
00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:51,300
cashier to the register and you're so and you're like oh my God, I feel so

101
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:54,180
awkward buying this and you go up and you're you're buying the toilet paper.

102
00:05:54,180 --> 00:05:57,760
You go. I'm actually buying this for a friend. I'm buying this for somebody

103
00:05:57,760 --> 00:06:01,420
like tapping someone on the shoulder. I can you buy this for me? I've thought

104
00:06:01,420 --> 00:06:06,440
that I gave it. I gave him the rolls of toilet paper like the big going to I ran

105
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:10,880
way and hid behind the makeup counter. Well, that's even more embarrassing.

106
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:15,120
Now, that's way more embarrassing. I've had that thought before where I was

107
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:20,160
checking out at Walgreens and it is funny to buy. It is honestly funny to

108
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:25,160
buy toilet paper. There's like a pretty cashier and she just knows that this is

109
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:28,360
going to touch your poop. Yeah, yeah, well, that's how I say you buy it and

110
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:31,360
you're like, honestly, I don't even know what this stuff is. I just thought it

111
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:33,800
looks cool. First time trying it. Yeah.

112
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:38,720
Have you ever used it before? Is it good? Is it bad? Is this one good? You had so

113
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:41,120
many of them over there. I'm just buying this stuff just in case. Yeah. I don't

114
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:44,480
need it. Yeah. I don't need this at all. I'm doing a... This is for my

115
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:50,160
bug out bag. Yeah. This is for my neighbor. And six rolls of toilet

116
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:53,760
paper. Okay. Alright. I'll make sure to get that. Sounds good. Beep. Wait, you

117
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:57,040
want six rolls? How much shitting are you doing? You're doing so much crap.

118
00:06:57,040 --> 00:07:00,720
Sorry. My friend is basically addicted to shit. Yeah. My friend's so fucking

119
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:03,440
weird. And I'm the one... He made me come here to buy this. But then they...

120
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:06,580
but here's the one who has to buy it for him, because he's banned from buying it.

121
00:07:06,580 --> 00:07:10,540
Yeah, if you could buy so much, what I thought this was just paper, my thumb

122
00:07:10,540 --> 00:07:15,680
was covering the word. What the fuck I thought it was let paper. What the hell

123
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:19,680
is this? E T paper, where would this even go in the toilet? I thought it was

124
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:24,780
weird back. E T weird alien paper. You put this in the back of the toilet and

125
00:07:24,780 --> 00:07:28,200
it collects all the water. Here's the world we're heading towards the all

126
00:07:29,860 --> 00:07:35,540
you walk in to the Walgreens, you put twelve rolls, you think, "Oh, I'm going to stock

127
00:07:35,540 --> 00:07:39,340
up." You put twelve rolls and they say, "ID, please."

128
00:07:39,340 --> 00:07:40,340
Damn.

129
00:07:40,340 --> 00:07:41,340
Yep.

130
00:07:41,340 --> 00:07:42,340
Eighteen plus.

131
00:07:42,340 --> 00:07:43,340
Yeah, like Benadryl.

132
00:07:43,340 --> 00:07:46,140
To make sure that they aren't going into a gender neutral bathroom.

133
00:07:46,140 --> 00:07:49,920
Another of my cultural predictions here. I think it's time to watch out. I think a new

134
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:54,340
disease is spreading because today when we went to buy toilet paper, there was barely

135
00:07:54,340 --> 00:07:55,700
any toilet paper on the shelves.

136
00:07:55,700 --> 00:07:56,700
In the right aid.

137
00:07:56,700 --> 00:08:00,800
run on toilet paper, people are buying it up. Something is going on. People are

138
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:06,140
going to be stuck in their houses that usually most of the I mean the drinks in

139
00:08:06,140 --> 00:08:11,000
the back are usually barren. You know it's kind of it's a right aid where they

140
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:16,400
constantly are low on items, but the fact that they had low stock on toilet paper

141
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:21,500
today, yep, it's predicting Cameron's future. It is pretty it's a prediction of

142
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:25,680
his future leaves my prediction of the world. His future, that's even my future

143
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:29,780
because I'm part of the world, but I just want to be clear. This is going to happen to everyone.

144
00:08:29,780 --> 00:08:35,220
And it's probably based on either my bug prediction I made about insects or a new prediction I've

145
00:08:35,220 --> 00:08:38,400
been working on that I think there's a new disease that you get for one night and it

146
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:44,020
only happens when it's dark out. Oh, okay. It just gave me chills. Yeah, that's going

147
00:08:44,020 --> 00:08:49,140
to be one symptom of the disease. My prediction, I know it's been making me so unbelievably

148
00:08:49,140 --> 00:08:54,440
mad that it's come on, bro. Stop playing with your white cover. Don't make it up. It's really

149
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:58,600
you get dude don't twirl it bro. This is hurting. You know what that looks like

150
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:00,880
you know what that looks like right now. What do they call it?

151
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:03,400
Don't talk like that either.

152
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:07,780
What does it look like? No don't

153
00:09:07,780 --> 00:09:14,500
you're acting crazy. You're acting crazy today. You have to see it from the

154
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:14,920
side.

155
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:17,560
Yeah, it does look

156
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:20,680
it does look crazy like a penis.

157
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:27,520
it's the same kind of color difference to yeah, exactly the shaft in the shaft is

158
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:36,520
that was honestly that was the gayest thing I've ever seen you to do you

159
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:40,560
helping it and you kissing it. That was so disgusting,

160
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:44,440
disgusting or not disgusting because it's

161
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:49,560
disgusting to do that. It's going to be sexual at work is what I'm saying.

162
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:53,380
okay, well we're not at work. We're still you literally violated that when you

163
00:09:53,380 --> 00:09:56,720
made me come into the bathroom with you and wipe your butt. Did not okay,

164
00:09:56,720 --> 00:10:00,420
here's what was weird is that you open the door to hand me the toilet paper and

165
00:10:00,420 --> 00:10:04,600
you looked right at me. You're supposed to do a courtesy. No, I want to see what

166
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:08,520
you're doing in there. I'm taking a shit. Well, you should be he opened the

167
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:10,040
door. He opened the door and started going.

168
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:15,880
You did you. I was trying to hold the first. I saw your I saw the tip of your

169
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:19,960
those come through every single crack in the door before you opened it and sniff

170
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:19,980
it.

171
00:10:19,980 --> 00:10:24,380
You doing that like a truffle pig is trying to find out if he's trying to find

172
00:10:24,380 --> 00:10:26,540
out if you had any mushrooms in your poop.

173
00:10:26,540 --> 00:10:28,360
Could be.

174
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:35,160
I get excited about stuff. Sue me. Okay. I'm not gonna hurt you. That's like the

175
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:38,180
thing we were talking about. That trait of mine is why I'm one of the most fun

176
00:10:38,180 --> 00:10:43,080
people to go to an arcade roller coaster concert with. So I'm not gonna apologize

177
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:44,980
or how I act around my friends at a bath.

178
00:10:44,980 --> 00:10:46,460
You go to a roller coaster.

179
00:10:46,460 --> 00:10:47,780
You go to a place that has a roller coaster.

180
00:10:47,780 --> 00:10:49,740
I don't agree with him right now.

181
00:10:49,740 --> 00:10:51,420
I don't agree with his actions.

182
00:10:51,420 --> 00:10:53,060
I don't agree with his attitude today.

183
00:10:53,060 --> 00:10:54,700
I don't agree with his actions or his attitude.

184
00:10:54,700 --> 00:10:57,580
He had to be my toilet paper slave and now he's got a whole bat.

185
00:10:57,580 --> 00:10:59,540
I'm sorry, but I do agree that you go to a roller coaster.

186
00:10:59,540 --> 00:11:00,740
Can I come clean really quick?

187
00:11:00,740 --> 00:11:01,740
Yeah.

188
00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:05,900
I have been acting out lately because a few nights ago I had a dream where I got struck

189
00:11:05,900 --> 00:11:09,020
by lightning and I haven't recovered.

190
00:11:09,020 --> 00:11:10,020
That is really...

191
00:11:10,020 --> 00:11:14,020
you got struck by lightning and survived or you woke up?

192
00:11:14,020 --> 00:11:17,220
Yeah, here's what happened in the dream. I was outside, there was lightning striking

193
00:11:17,220 --> 00:11:21,260
all around. I thought I should go inside so lightning doesn't strike me. So I start to

194
00:11:21,260 --> 00:11:26,100
run inside. Then lightning strikes near me. I think, "Oh, I'm safe. It only struck near

195
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:29,940
way that was lucky, but then it goes into the ground and it goes and it goes

196
00:11:29,940 --> 00:11:33,140
across the ground like a video game area of effect. What if you woke up? It goes

197
00:11:33,140 --> 00:11:36,880
into my body and then it goes up my body like and I shake around and I fall to

198
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:40,900
the ground and then my heart stops and then I was survived and then I got up

199
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:44,760
and I said and my dream I said, well, I thought I was going to die, but it

200
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:47,980
actually just felt weird. What if you woke up from that? That's how you in

201
00:11:47,980 --> 00:11:52,260
real life you'd say like well, that's a dream. If you woke up from that dream

202
00:11:52,260 --> 00:11:54,860
and your finger is just in your the outlet in your

203
00:11:54,860 --> 00:12:01,160
you're doing sleep. You woke up and it's like you're like your nightstand is

204
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:05,620
here, your bed, your bed is here and just everything out of the way the I'm

205
00:12:05,620 --> 00:12:11,700
chewing on my phone charging cable down it perfectly in the outlet on the wall.

206
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:15,720
My outlet shaped, pulled shaped finger shaped. Well, you have it yeah, you

207
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:19,320
got because we have a whole gel finger in your mouth. Yeah, I know you doesn't

208
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:22,160
sleep with your finger in your mouth and then you scratch your balls, put your

209
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:22,940
finger in your mouth.

210
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:29,340
I wonder if I ever done that myself. You know when you it's your bud and then

211
00:12:29,340 --> 00:12:30,360
you stick your fingers

212
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:37,500
we all do it. I don't do we all do it man. It's not you don't have to be

213
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:41,160
afraid to admit it. Okay, I do it you're right. I do that shit.

214
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:43,780
I stick it in my mouth.

215
00:12:43,780 --> 00:12:46,920
What is up with you? Do you

216
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:51,220
the mall

217
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:56,000
while you're like looking or

218
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:01,440
your Christmas shopping your Christmas shopping for your girlfriend, you're in

219
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:04,540
the middle of Victoria's Secret, the woman's about to walk up to you and

220
00:13:04,540 --> 00:13:05,120
you're just going

221
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:08,960
I was like about like a

222
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:11,560
sound is an apple. When you put your

223
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:12,640
your

224
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:19,840
I don't like this idea. This is

225
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:24,960
well, I'm just doing an absent mind and I'm doing it in the way of like I

226
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:28,520
forget I'm not on my couch. Yeah, yeah, this is something I do regularly.

227
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:31,400
Oh, oops, I did it on the end

228
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:35,200
middle of Brandy Melville

229
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:45,120
getting which one's the stinky finger, damn the stinky finger. Oh, I think that

230
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:45,360
I

231
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:52,080
honestly eating, eating my own shit. We've talked about this. No, we

232
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:55,880
Yeah, we never talked about that. We've never talked about eating shit. No, I

233
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:58,080
think that it would be, it's either

234
00:13:58,080 --> 00:14:03,120
I think it would ruin my life, 'cause I would be so ashamed or it might end up

235
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:06,480
being the highest form of artistic expression that you can do. Those people

236
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:10,680
who are into scat are not ashamed of it. They don't eat the shit, though,

237
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:14,240
right? No, they eat the shit. I thought they just cover their butts and their

238
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:17,360
penises on it. They cover their butts and their penises, and then they suck

239
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:18,920
the shit off the penises.

240
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:20,920
So gross.

241
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:22,800
(laughter)

242
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:24,000
- They suck the shit off the penis.

243
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,960
- You're like eight years old.

244
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:27,160
- That's what I've seen.

245
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:28,920
- And then they fucking fart diarrhea

246
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:30,880
and they suck the penis off the shit.

247
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:34,440
- That's the worst thing you can send to somebody.

248
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:35,280
- I used to, I'm--

249
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:39,960
- People think it's like, oh, you sent me a photo of that--

250
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:41,880
- I was thinking maybe when Cameron opened the door

251
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:43,600
I was gonna show him my poopy butthole.

252
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:44,440
- Yeah.

253
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:45,260
- I decided that I was hoping--

254
00:14:45,260 --> 00:14:46,680
- I thought I was ruining our friendship.

255
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:49,680
- I used to be immature,

256
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:54,720
I used to think stuff was funny like Patrick said. I used to find scat funny, but now I've

257
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:58,600
grown up a little and now I find skak funny. I'm a fan of all comedy.

258
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:03,000
Yeah, skak backpack. I'm a fan of Pierce Campion and Will Duncan.

259
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,200
Yeah, no doubt.

260
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:09,040
Man, what the fuck is going on this week in the news?

261
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:10,040
What's going on in the world?

262
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:11,040
I mean, what is there even?

263
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:12,360
Well, I told you about night disease.

264
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:13,360
Yeah, night disease.

265
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:14,360
What's night disease?

266
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:17,360
It's the disease you only get for one night in the dark.

267
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:18,360
Can you explain night disease?

268
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:19,360
You, you what?

269
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:23,400
for one night in the dark. I was just talking about the symptoms congestion

270
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:27,660
chills, bad dreams. Oh wait, I've had this disease before you get it for about

271
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:31,120
eight to ten hours. I can if I if I have something I have to do and I don't

272
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:35,280
want to do it, I get I get sick for two hours. You don't even get it before

273
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:38,720
you lie, but you lie down in bed. You instantly get it. The second that you're

274
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:41,920
horizontal, you get it. You when you wake up in the morning, it's completely

275
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:45,560
gone. Yeah, it's not a it's night disease. Yeah, it's really gonna take

276
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:49,960
all over the world in a pandemic. I've had night disease before it's coming.

277
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:54,400
It's coming, it's coming. That's why the toilet paper is gone. Yeah, that's what I

278
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:56,960
was saying. That's all along what I was saying. That's even the context I

279
00:15:56,960 --> 00:16:00,880
brought up night disease and in fact really a dream about a dream about

280
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:01,720
toilet paper.

281
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:05,560
What you had a dream about toilet paper going on?

282
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:10,720
I didn't have a dream about toilet paper. I had a real life experience of

283
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:15,320
toilet paper being gone. Have you ever have you ever had a dream that you're

284
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:24,020
pooping. No, you wake up and you're already going. I think I almost every

285
00:16:24,020 --> 00:16:27,620
single time I wake up in the middle of night or I'm really tired and I sit down

286
00:16:27,620 --> 00:16:32,720
to shit. I get really scared that I'm dreaming and I'm either shitting my

287
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:39,320
pants or I have slept walked to the toilet and I'm shitting on top of the

288
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:44,220
toilet. It's such a crazy. I don't think that anyone I've ever seen anyone do it

289
00:16:44,220 --> 00:16:50,260
I've never done it myself. I've never met a baby. I don't think I've ever woken up and

290
00:16:50,260 --> 00:16:54,260
had to go shit really bad. Yeah, definitely always have to go pee really bad when I wake

291
00:16:54,260 --> 00:16:57,620
up. Sometimes I wake up in the morning and I don't think that's ever happened. You're

292
00:16:57,620 --> 00:17:01,020
gonna run to the bathroom. I gotta get up. I mean, I gotta walk to the bathroom. It's

293
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:06,020
not that urgent. Sure. But yeah, I guess I don't even think I need to go until I'm up

294
00:17:06,020 --> 00:17:11,460
and awake. When I had food poisoning, when I had food poisoning in like 2016, food poisoning

295
00:17:11,460 --> 00:17:15,580
doesn't count. Well that's the craziest feeling though is I would have these like fever dreams

296
00:17:15,580 --> 00:17:19,900
and then like wake up and have to go shit and waking up having to shit like waking up

297
00:17:19,900 --> 00:17:24,380
and having to pee is like okay like I can I know how to hold this but like waking up

298
00:17:24,380 --> 00:17:27,940
and having to poop. You don't know how to hold your poop. You're like holding your like

299
00:17:27,940 --> 00:17:32,660
stomach so that like you think that you're holding the poop in your hands. How far away

300
00:17:32,660 --> 00:17:35,980
is your bathroom? What are you talking about? How long does it take you to get from your

301
00:17:35,980 --> 00:17:41,740
your bed to your toilet sometime well in my parents old house. It was a little

302
00:17:41,740 --> 00:17:46,420
hallway. Yeah, they lived in a hallway. They're very railway, a railway style

303
00:17:46,420 --> 00:17:50,420
hallway, a railway on a real when the bathroom when you have a station,

304
00:17:50,420 --> 00:17:53,580
you're really long way. I was just really weak and just like having to like

305
00:17:53,580 --> 00:17:57,820
get up and run because I like I'm about to shit your pants man. You're sick. Oh,

306
00:17:57,820 --> 00:18:00,940
I'm not shitting my you're allowed to shit your pants. If you're sick, I

307
00:18:00,980 --> 00:18:06,020
I only think that's your chance man. I don't even like that. Come on man. I

308
00:18:06,020 --> 00:18:08,820
don't even like shitting my pants. What the hell are you doing? This is your

309
00:18:08,820 --> 00:18:12,780
only excuse. Make your girlfriend clean it up bro. I don't even like shitting

310
00:18:12,780 --> 00:18:16,260
my pants. I can't clean it up. I'm so sick. I don't know about, I think you

311
00:18:16,260 --> 00:18:19,860
two like that, but I, me personally. Shitting your damn pants. I hate shitting

312
00:18:19,860 --> 00:18:24,020
my pants. I love it man. Every time I get a chance, I'm, I'm dropping a,

313
00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:29,940
dropping a shotgun blast at chili in my shorts. No, it is true freedom. I

314
00:18:30,620 --> 00:18:36,060
crap, there's shotgun blasted chili in my primark jeans. I think if I and the

315
00:18:36,060 --> 00:18:40,340
spandex expanded around the poop, I think the only thing that keeps me from not

316
00:18:40,340 --> 00:18:47,100
ending my life is maybe the thought that it's that I could never be sick ever

317
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:51,500
again because of every single time that I'm really sick. I'm like I have food

318
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:54,060
poisoning. Anytime you get food poisoning, you're like, "If I could press

319
00:18:54,060 --> 00:18:58,100
a button and die right now, I would do it." There are many, many people in this

320
00:18:58,140 --> 00:19:02,940
world who turn a billion forty years old and they never are sick again for the

321
00:19:02,940 --> 00:19:06,600
rest of their life. Really? Yeah, unless they get like it. They're called

322
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:10,820
they're called immune, immunions, immunions, where they where they hail

323
00:19:10,820 --> 00:19:14,300
from. My dad is one of them. Your dad's an immunion. I guess my dad might be

324
00:19:14,300 --> 00:19:18,840
too. My dad, my dad got covid and he played golf with all his buddies. They

325
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:22,580
just some people just don't get sick. That's sick. My mom, I think, is one of

326
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:29,460
had COVID early, like my dad had COVID June 2020. So both of these are not ringing true

327
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:33,420
as immunians to me because both of these stories are about people who got sick. No, no, no,

328
00:19:33,420 --> 00:19:40,620
no, no, no, no, no, my mom, my dad got COVID, my dad got COVID and then my mom like was

329
00:19:40,620 --> 00:19:46,420
in the same room as him. She didn't give a shit. I was sucking his dong. Why'd you say

330
00:19:46,420 --> 00:19:50,900
that Pat? Yeah, did you talk about your own mom? She was, she was, she had teeth with

331
00:19:50,900 --> 00:19:56,500
with his ball sack hair and spitting on it. She didn't get COVID, though. You

332
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:57,860
can't get COVID from eating cum.

333
00:19:57,860 --> 00:20:05,380
That's the only contact I had. He came into a law, into a bank tube, a delivery

334
00:20:05,380 --> 00:20:09,740
directly to her mouth every single day. Yeah, you can't get COVID from that.

335
00:20:09,740 --> 00:20:14,620
That's gross. Who the fuck is calling me? Probably my mom to tell you to stop

336
00:20:14,620 --> 00:20:18,380
talking about her like that. I knew it. I knew it. He's calling me. Oh, my God.

337
00:20:19,060 --> 00:20:22,540
pick it up, just got a word at him, pick it up, and he just got screened. I don't

338
00:20:22,540 --> 00:20:25,540
want to pick it up and have him on speaker phone so he can blast his ass

339
00:20:25,540 --> 00:20:30,260
for ruining our job. He'll say something so fucking out of pocket, bro. He will.

340
00:20:30,260 --> 00:20:33,540
I don't want to fuck with that right now. We'd have to edit out him saying some

341
00:20:33,540 --> 00:20:38,580
shit. He's gonna say, guess who met Taylor Swift last night? Dude, I was

342
00:20:38,580 --> 00:20:41,060
backstage. Oh, I don't know, bro.

343
00:20:41,060 --> 00:20:48,540
I met Taylor Swift. Yeah, dude, she was chill. She was chill.

344
00:20:48,540 --> 00:20:52,380
awful. I got awesome bro. Thank you for calling me. Did you buy our plane tickets

345
00:20:52,380 --> 00:20:54,420
that we for tomorrow morning yet?

346
00:20:54,420 --> 00:21:03,380
Yeah, he's a good guy. Yeah, yeah. He at Funny Mom, Chappell's son was there.

347
00:21:03,380 --> 00:21:08,300
I feel like this is a bit of a too much inside bit. Probably shouldn't say it,

348
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:13,220
but he got so excited that he was like, can I can I tell everyone who you are?

349
00:21:17,420 --> 00:21:22,940
that is so sick. Do you guys wish that you were would it be good or bad to be a

350
00:21:22,940 --> 00:21:23,900
celebrity's child?

351
00:21:23,900 --> 00:21:28,860
I've probably my theories about celebrity children and you guys stomped all over

352
00:21:28,860 --> 00:21:34,620
it. What was your theory? I told you that God should reward fans of Tom Cruise by

353
00:21:34,620 --> 00:21:38,940
reincarnating them as Tom Cruise's children and you guys said that's crazy.

354
00:21:38,940 --> 00:21:43,300
I never let it go. We said that it was crazy. We said it was not crazy. He said

355
00:21:43,300 --> 00:21:46,660
that that's what you were thinking about in the shower would have been would be an

356
00:21:46,700 --> 00:21:50,940
abusive father because he's a Scientologist. So the only way that

357
00:21:50,940 --> 00:21:55,000
somebody could enjoy and have a happy life as a child of Tom Cruise is having

358
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,260
a remembrance of a past life where they loved him.

359
00:21:57,260 --> 00:22:01,740
That seems just... I just don't know...

360
00:22:01,740 --> 00:22:06,100
You're just changing the subject, I think, because what I'm talking about

361
00:22:06,100 --> 00:22:09,300
is what it would be like to be a celebrity child and you're doing this

362
00:22:09,300 --> 00:22:13,060
whole... It would be bad. Unless you were in a past life a fan of

363
00:22:13,060 --> 00:22:16,660
that celebrity. I don't get the reincarnation aspect of it. I

364
00:22:16,660 --> 00:22:20,540
know why that's I do think you're going to be a fan of them in a past life if

365
00:22:20,540 --> 00:22:25,900
you're not reincarnated would stink to be this the child of one of the greatest

366
00:22:25,900 --> 00:22:30,500
artists. Yeah, because you'd have no ability to enjoy their work. The

367
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:34,700
sliding or the I don't like the fucking I don't like my dad's the whatever

368
00:22:34,700 --> 00:22:38,340
no, I think you're stuck. Oh, my dad does. I don't give a fuck about that.

369
00:22:38,340 --> 00:22:41,580
The spectrum here is you're either like when you're a celebrity skid, you're

370
00:22:41,580 --> 00:22:46,620
either a Robert Downey Jr. Or like a fucking not even like a Chet Hanks

371
00:22:46,620 --> 00:22:50,520
but just like somebody you're like the son of like Dan Schneider or something

372
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:52,520
would weird example.

373
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:53,220
Interesting choice.

374
00:22:53,220 --> 00:22:56,420
Just like a celebrity that everybody hates.

375
00:22:56,420 --> 00:22:59,120
That feels like a good experience to be a child around Dan Schneider.

376
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:01,120
The son of Dan Schneider feels like a big heart.

377
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:05,620
The middle ground here is just being like fucking Fisher Stevens kid.

378
00:23:05,620 --> 00:23:06,620
I'm going to blow this out of the water.

379
00:23:06,620 --> 00:23:07,120
Okay.

380
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:11,120
It would be all these people's kids, you know, would be incredible.

381
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:14,620
Any of these people except Dan Schneider as your uncle.

382
00:23:14,620 --> 00:23:17,420
No, she would be right with him as a

383
00:23:17,420 --> 00:23:21,020
greatest. That would be so incredible. I'm

384
00:23:21,020 --> 00:23:24,520
getting excited about it. I treat Matt

385
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:27,220
like he's a celebrity. Yeah, uncles are

386
00:23:27,220 --> 00:23:29,320
so the celebrities of your life. There's

387
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:30,920
no question. Everything that they do is

388
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:33,120
cool to you. Yeah, you get you keep up

389
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:35,220
with them on Instagram. Yeah, exactly.

390
00:23:35,220 --> 00:23:36,820
Like you see the news stories where it's

391
00:23:36,820 --> 00:23:38,520
like look what look what he was doing.

392
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:41,520
He was hiking. I still think there's

393
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:43,120
time for Matt to become a celebrity. My

394
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:45,920
My nephews fully believe that I met Spongebob.

395
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:47,120
Really?

396
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:48,420
My nephews fully.

397
00:23:48,420 --> 00:23:49,920
Did you say that or they said that?

398
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:57,920
I told them that I met him in New York at a party and because they were watching some

399
00:23:57,920 --> 00:23:58,920
YouTuber.

400
00:23:58,920 --> 00:24:00,920
That would be so fucking awesome.

401
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:06,020
They were watching some YouTuber play Battle of Bikini Bottom and I said, "Oh, do you guys

402
00:24:06,020 --> 00:24:07,520
know I met him once?"

403
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:10,520
They turned around and they went, "Really?"

404
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:17,400
So did you tell them that you met Spongebob? Not Tom Chimney. You said that you met Spongebob.

405
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:23,640
I said I met Spongebob and we got drinks together. You hit it off so well at this party that

406
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:27,440
you guys, did you go to a second location that night? Or did you? Yeah, no I was telling

407
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:33,880
them that like you know I met Spongebob, we're like pretty good friends now, and they think

408
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:38,320
that I know Spongebob and they think that I'm neighbors with Spider-Man. I mean you might

409
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:44,000
be. I could be. I live in Queens. I think Spongebob might be. I feel like we don't know enough

410
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:47,960
about his personal life to the point where I know somebody's protecting him. He might

411
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:54,080
be like an NDA guy. Yeah. Oh yeah. Well I hung out with him and he was amazing. Really?

412
00:24:54,080 --> 00:25:02,580
We got drinks at what's that bar downtown? I heard that 169 bar. Spongebob makes girls

413
00:25:02,580 --> 00:25:08,540
sign NDAs and he also won't fuck or date any girl above the age of two. In sponge years.

414
00:25:08,540 --> 00:25:15,280
In sponge years, which is 46. But for him it's two. But for everybody, that's why nobody

415
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:19,340
really cares because he's a sponge so he pretty much lives forever. And he also will only

416
00:25:19,340 --> 00:25:24,500
fuck small women that are the size of sponges. So he has a really hard time in the dating

417
00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:30,340
scene. Yeah, except for in the sea. The dating sea he does very well. Hey, there's plenty

418
00:25:30,340 --> 00:25:34,100
at fish there. He doesn't fuck fish. He fucks human women there to the size of a

419
00:25:34,100 --> 00:25:38,100
sponge. He doesn't like plenty of fish in the sea like the... No, no, I got it.

420
00:25:38,100 --> 00:25:42,820
Like the old idiom. Old idiom? I don't think people say that all the time. I

421
00:25:42,820 --> 00:25:46,420
don't even know if that one's that old. That one's pretty old. I bet that one

422
00:25:46,420 --> 00:25:49,300
came from like a rom-com in the 90s. They haven't figured out that they were

423
00:25:49,300 --> 00:25:53,060
rom-com in the 90s. That fish lived in the sea since like... About a sailor. They didn't

424
00:25:53,060 --> 00:25:59,780
know that. Yeah. I found out about a... 1573. Oh! He was so right again.

425
00:25:59,780 --> 00:26:03,620
we doubted him again and he was right again. Well, I do actually know

426
00:26:03,620 --> 00:26:08,800
Spongebob, so you are a genius man and I never have a fish come from

427
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:14,420
comes from the sea. Plenty of fish come from the sea and they learned that in

428
00:26:14,420 --> 00:26:19,420
fifteen seventy three. Yeah, no shit, no fucking shit.

429
00:26:19,420 --> 00:26:24,740
I think people who use idioms might be idiots. Maybe that's where you use

430
00:26:24,780 --> 00:26:30,100
from uh, idioids. Yeah, idioids. Using those idioms. It's crazy that you think that as a

431
00:26:30,100 --> 00:26:35,180
person from the south. That's all that you guys speak in. I don't, dude. All you guys

432
00:26:35,180 --> 00:26:39,860
speak in is idioms. There was a video this week of that girl talking in a southern accent

433
00:26:39,860 --> 00:26:44,340
and people were hating on her. What video? It was a video of some girl and she's saying

434
00:26:44,340 --> 00:26:48,540
like "You don't want to mess with me y'all, cause I'm from the south and women from the

435
00:26:48,540 --> 00:26:52,620
south are crazy." They are. And people were like "This bitch is fucked, this bitch." Bro,

436
00:26:52,620 --> 00:26:56,620
They are. She was so beautiful and her voice was, she had the voice of an angel.

437
00:26:56,620 --> 00:26:59,940
Why do people hate the southern accent? It's great. I don't know.

438
00:26:59,940 --> 00:27:01,700
Is it because we're stupider?

439
00:27:01,700 --> 00:27:04,940
It's probably because of the civil war.

440
00:27:04,940 --> 00:27:10,260
If you think about it, there's a historical reason why.

441
00:27:10,260 --> 00:27:12,100
You think it was fought over the voices?

442
00:27:12,100 --> 00:27:16,260
It was fought over their accents because people up north were saying like,

443
00:27:16,260 --> 00:27:20,380
you guys are retarded. You guys are no fucking piece of crap.

444
00:27:21,380 --> 00:27:22,520
Stop with the slaves, kid.

445
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:24,520
Stop with the fucking slaves, kid.

446
00:27:24,520 --> 00:27:25,520
It's a fucking nightmare.

447
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:27,020
Bro, what are you doing?

448
00:27:27,020 --> 00:27:29,020
What the fuck are you doing with these slaves?

449
00:27:29,020 --> 00:27:30,420
What the fuck are you doing, bro?

450
00:27:30,420 --> 00:27:31,420
That's a human being!

451
00:27:31,420 --> 00:27:32,420
Whoa!

452
00:27:32,420 --> 00:27:33,420
Not at all!

453
00:27:33,420 --> 00:27:34,420
What are you doing?

454
00:27:34,420 --> 00:27:36,420
And we were...

455
00:27:36,420 --> 00:27:37,420
Put him back!

456
00:27:37,420 --> 00:27:38,420
Or not we, but they.

457
00:27:38,420 --> 00:27:39,420
We?

458
00:27:39,420 --> 00:27:40,420
Not we.

459
00:27:40,420 --> 00:27:43,300
My whole family, nobody in my family ever had slaves.

460
00:27:43,300 --> 00:27:44,980
I'd like to say that.

461
00:27:44,980 --> 00:27:46,860
If I, I mean...

462
00:27:46,860 --> 00:27:48,040
Have you done ancestry?

463
00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:49,040
Do you know that that's true?

464
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:50,040
It's 100% true.

465
00:27:50,040 --> 00:27:51,040
Yeah?

466
00:27:51,040 --> 00:27:56,740
family was like like fucking dust farmers in Oklahoma. They would farm dust or

467
00:27:56,740 --> 00:28:01,060
some shit. I don't know why would they farm dust? What is that even gonna? I

468
00:28:01,060 --> 00:28:05,120
don't know anything about them. I just know for sure they didn't have slaves.

469
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:09,360
That's the only thing it said. You see, you think that they don't have slaves

470
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:13,640
and then you like look up your family on ancestry and you see them and in their

471
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:18,440
field there's all these dust people. Yeah, I'm driving by the pits plantations

472
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:24,000
left and right all through North Carolina. It's all clouds of dust that are

473
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:30,720
like picking corn off of corn stalks and shit. You have all these dust people.

474
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:35,880
I have toured one plantation and one historical home. Have we talked about

475
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:38,480
this? How funny it is that any time you go to any kind of historical thing

476
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:40,480
where they had slaves, they always say,

477
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:45,140
"And unlike a lot of people in the area, the slaves were actually treated very

478
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:49,120
smell here. That's why they keep the building up. And they sometimes ate the

479
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:50,120
leftover food,

480
00:28:50,120 --> 00:28:52,120
the leftover...

481
00:28:52,120 --> 00:28:56,880
They didn't have to eat kibble all the time, like a lot of the other slaves in

482
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:58,240
the area. Yeah. Yeah.

483
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:03,800
Man. Yeah. But those places are, I mean, they're beautiful homes. I gotta give

484
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:08,240
it to them. Yeah. They had good taste. Those plantations look pretty good.

485
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:11,320
Once you get rid of all the history, it's a pretty nice building. Once you get rid

486
00:29:11,320 --> 00:29:14,880
of all the ghosts, it's actually a pretty nice place. I haven't been to,

487
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:17,680
a historical thing in a long time. There's not as many of those kind of things.

488
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:21,280
Buddy, you see a historical building every single day in this beautiful melting pot of

489
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:22,280
a city.

490
00:29:22,280 --> 00:29:24,320
The historical buildings in New York suck fucking dick.

491
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:25,320
Yeah, they're not as good.

492
00:29:25,320 --> 00:29:29,160
This is the worst city for history of all time. Worse than a city that was built in

493
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:30,160
1990.

494
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:32,920
Yeah. What cities were built in 1990?

495
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:36,880
If there was one, this would be a worse city for history than that one is what I'm saying.

496
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:39,800
Probably like Game Boy Nevada or something.

497
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:45,200
What is it? It's in Nevada. They have the Simpsons house, the one to one replica of the

498
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:46,960
Simpsons home.

499
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:49,760
That state is so unbelievably fucked up.

500
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:54,960
Yeah. Well, it's dude, it's like legal gambling and then like also Mormons and shit.

501
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:57,240
Yeah. Do they have the...

502
00:29:57,240 --> 00:29:58,560
Imagine how fucked up it would be.

503
00:29:58,560 --> 00:29:59,560
The nuclear uroam.

504
00:29:59,560 --> 00:30:02,280
You would be fucked up too if you were shaped like an exacto knife blade.

505
00:30:02,280 --> 00:30:03,280
That is true.

506
00:30:03,280 --> 00:30:04,520
You would be emo as fuck.

507
00:30:04,520 --> 00:30:05,880
That is real shit.

508
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:10,920
They have a I think the nuclear testing has destroyed that. You stay forever. You have

509
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:18,440
Reno. New Mexico. I thought I don't care. It's still it. It travels. It does travel.

510
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:23,000
Yeah, you're right. But I think New Mexico is where they all have all those beads. New

511
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:29,720
Mexico is fine. New Mexico is fine. I like all Mexico. They dropped the bombs in New

512
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:33,920
New Mexico. They dropped bombs in Roswell. No, they had an alien there,

513
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:37,720
which I've been... They dropped a bomb on that one. ...international media...

514
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:41,420
Am I... When they announced the alien... Am I confusing this? I don't know.

515
00:30:41,420 --> 00:30:44,160
What are you... They tested the bombs in... They tested the bombs in... Los

516
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:49,780
Alamos. In New Mexico? Yeah. Okay, and is that on the border of Nevada?

517
00:30:49,780 --> 00:30:52,560
Probably not. I don't know. Where did they...

518
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:56,940
Were they testing nukes on aliens to see if they were resilient to them?

519
00:30:56,940 --> 00:31:02,340
Yes, I would do that. I think that's settled science. Yeah, yeah, Nevada test

520
00:31:02,340 --> 00:31:07,940
site. Oh my God. Oh, yeah, you're right. Oh, yeah, I was the most lady.

521
00:31:07,940 --> 00:31:12,540
Significant. I was getting a lady in Roswell, so I in the Nevada test site

522
00:31:12,540 --> 00:31:17,040
Roswell is nothing to do with any of this. I know I went to Roswell for

523
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:21,040
no reason. I thought that's where all that stuff went on. I thought area 51

524
00:31:21,040 --> 00:31:25,140
was like we tested bombs here. That's where aliens landed. Well, they got a

525
00:31:25,140 --> 00:31:28,040
lot. I just think that whole area of the country has just too much fucked up

526
00:31:28,040 --> 00:31:31,840
stuff coming out of it. Yeah, I've never met anybody from any of those places,

527
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:36,020
except for fucking Adams from Las Vegas, I guess. Yeah, but look at him. Yeah,

528
00:31:36,020 --> 00:31:40,340
exactly, but like I think people who go to those places who move there to live

529
00:31:40,340 --> 00:31:44,880
there too are crazy. Yeah, why would you people retire to escape your family and

530
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:48,100
move to somewhere where it's a hundred and thirty degrees in the summer? Why

531
00:31:48,100 --> 00:31:51,600
would you go there, man? And there's no like water. They have animals called

532
00:31:51,620 --> 00:31:56,860
monsters. Yeah, I think that's true. They do. There's also there's also people

533
00:31:56,860 --> 00:32:00,180
that retire in the north. I'm just thinking of that in general area. Oh

534
00:32:00,180 --> 00:32:03,420
damn, those I didn't even know those were in America. Yeah, people who retire

535
00:32:03,420 --> 00:32:06,940
in like New Hampshire. What's up? Fucked up. There's people that are going up

536
00:32:06,940 --> 00:32:10,900
and retiring. Retiring in the northeast is goaded. You think so? Yeah, 100%.

537
00:32:10,900 --> 00:32:14,300
Waterfront. Yeah, I guess you do get seasons. Mountains, waterfront, forest. You

538
00:32:14,300 --> 00:32:18,740
know exactly when, like a big thing with when you're getting older. The desert

539
00:32:18,740 --> 00:32:21,180
It's fucking not a place to retire in.

540
00:32:21,180 --> 00:32:22,480
Yeah, that's true.

541
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:23,480
Life cannot live there.

542
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:24,480
No.

543
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:27,100
Unless you like cactus and prickly pear.

544
00:32:27,100 --> 00:32:30,580
Well, if those are your two favorite things, then I think you should retire in them.

545
00:32:30,580 --> 00:32:31,940
You could just buy one of those and put it in your house.

546
00:32:31,940 --> 00:32:32,940
Damn right.

547
00:32:32,940 --> 00:32:35,060
Yeah, you could get them Instacarted.

548
00:32:35,060 --> 00:32:37,540
What are these people doing?

549
00:32:37,540 --> 00:32:39,500
They're going there to, I think they're gambling, I'm going to be honest.

550
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:42,300
They're probably going there to shrivel up like a raisin.

551
00:32:42,300 --> 00:32:45,500
I think they're gambling with their lives every single summer.

552
00:32:45,500 --> 00:32:49,720
Can you guys, do you guys think it's going to suck when you get older and all your friends

553
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:50,720
start to die?

554
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:51,720
Yeah.

555
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:52,720
I can't wait.

556
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:58,300
I think about that constantly because everyone, everyone I know is dropping like flies.

557
00:32:58,300 --> 00:32:59,740
You've had friends pass away recently?

558
00:32:59,740 --> 00:33:03,180
I've had every single one of my friends die.

559
00:33:03,180 --> 00:33:04,180
And I'm stuck with you and Cameron.

560
00:33:04,180 --> 00:33:05,180
So that makes me and Cameron feel like shit.

561
00:33:05,180 --> 00:33:06,180
Yeah, that's not great.

562
00:33:06,180 --> 00:33:07,180
And I'm stuck with you guys.

563
00:33:07,180 --> 00:33:08,660
Because we're not your friends, we're your brothers.

564
00:33:08,660 --> 00:33:11,060
My close personal friends are dead.

565
00:33:11,060 --> 00:33:12,060
Who?

566
00:33:12,060 --> 00:33:15,060
And I'm stuck with just these two business partners that I'm stuck with.

567
00:33:15,060 --> 00:33:22,260
King von King von past hard my good friend King von yeah, I think I'm

568
00:33:22,260 --> 00:33:25,960
probably going to slide for him pretty soon. Yeah, who else just who else of my

569
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:27,260
friends just passed away?

570
00:33:27,260 --> 00:33:33,460
Some kind of musical artist. Yeah, Avicii my close personal. That was over

571
00:33:33,460 --> 00:33:36,760
a decade. You should be over that feels it. Honestly, if you're not over a

572
00:33:36,760 --> 00:33:40,460
friend's death by 10 years, it's over for you and that wasn't your friend.

573
00:33:40,460 --> 00:33:41,660
That was your boyfriend, bro.

574
00:33:44,860 --> 00:33:46,300
they should be still thinking about

575
00:33:46,300 --> 00:33:47,800
I agree,

576
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:53,040
bro move on. You should be done shot. Oh, you're wasting years. I

577
00:33:53,040 --> 00:33:57,300
work time. Absolutely, absolutely, and that's if you're mentally ill yeah.

578
00:33:57,300 --> 00:34:03,060
Why are you going to the grave plot? You friggin jerk douche bag you do

579
00:34:03,060 --> 00:34:06,900
actually like a douche bag you're hogging all the flowers for your dead

580
00:34:06,900 --> 00:34:09,660
friend. He's not going to smell him get out of the cemetery. I want to walk

581
00:34:09,660 --> 00:34:12,660
around there. Yeah, you're making me uncomfortable. I'm trying to use the

582
00:34:12,680 --> 00:34:16,120
bathroom and all of a sudden you're putting a bunch of flowers underneath my

583
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:20,120
leg. I want to listen to my iPod and I want to smoke a fat cigarette. I have an

584
00:34:20,120 --> 00:34:23,320
iPod touch and I'm taking photos of me and my friends in here. I'm trying to

585
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:28,520
sneak in and be scary. I'm listening to Crystal and Ritz in here. This guy's

586
00:34:28,520 --> 00:34:32,360
name was Jeff fucking. Yeah, Jeff fucking and Dick Riblet are buried next to each

587
00:34:32,360 --> 00:34:36,200
other. Can I please take a photo of them? Oh, that's your friend? Your friend with

588
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:40,920
Dick Riblet? Yeah, nice try buddy. Oh yeah. Oh, I'm putting flowers on Dick

589
00:34:40,920 --> 00:34:45,380
riblets grave. Hey buddy, how about you put some flour on some riblets? Let's

590
00:34:45,380 --> 00:34:47,260
get a fucking barbecue going in here.

591
00:34:47,260 --> 00:34:53,180
Let's get a grill in this cemetery. You're gonna flour, you're gonna bread

592
00:34:53,180 --> 00:34:56,620
ribs. We're gonna bread riblets and we're gonna deep fry them over a thing

593
00:34:56,620 --> 00:35:00,740
of oil and a grill. Okay, so you're gonna take a Traeger, put a pot in it.

594
00:35:00,740 --> 00:35:04,320
Do you think I thought this through? And then you're gonna heat, somehow use

595
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:09,880
the smoker to heat up the oil to 400 degrees, and then we're gonna bread

596
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:15,780
riblets riblets cover the flour and then we're going to throw them in that

597
00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:18,460
into those actually look insane. Yeah,

598
00:35:18,460 --> 00:35:23,640
those look really good. I'm not sure if the technique was followed in the way

599
00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:29,020
that you said, no, but it is. I can tell that these probably I don't like that. I

600
00:35:29,020 --> 00:35:34,500
don't like that barbecue has become this whole thing man. You like to become a

601
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:38,840
line bar with it. You like you. Oh my God, this place in red hook. That's like

602
00:35:38,860 --> 00:35:40,860
the only good barbecue place in the city.

603
00:35:40,860 --> 00:35:41,360
Yeah.

604
00:35:41,360 --> 00:35:43,860
And it's like $70 for a plate of barbecue.

605
00:35:43,860 --> 00:35:44,860
Oh, that's bullshit.

606
00:35:44,860 --> 00:35:46,860
And people line around the block for this fucking place.

607
00:35:46,860 --> 00:35:48,860
Well, that's because you can't get it here.

608
00:35:48,860 --> 00:35:51,860
You can't get it here. You can't get good barbecue in New York.

609
00:35:51,860 --> 00:35:54,860
This place is honestly pretty good. I was pretty surprised.

610
00:35:54,860 --> 00:35:56,860
I've been wanting some barbecue lately.

611
00:35:56,860 --> 00:35:57,860
Oh my god.

612
00:35:57,860 --> 00:35:58,860
I was going to say...

613
00:35:58,860 --> 00:36:00,860
I want to go back to that place upstate.

614
00:36:00,860 --> 00:36:03,860
You definitely like that barbecue is becoming a huge thing

615
00:36:03,860 --> 00:36:05,860
because you can be a snob about which barbecue is the best.

616
00:36:05,860 --> 00:36:06,860
I'm not a snob about it at all.

617
00:36:06,860 --> 00:36:07,860
You're a southern guy.

618
00:36:07,860 --> 00:36:13,460
No, I don't give a fuck about it. I like North Carolina barbecue. I don't really like the

619
00:36:13,460 --> 00:36:14,620
South Carolina style.

620
00:36:14,620 --> 00:36:18,220
Snob. You just said he doesn't like a style.

621
00:36:18,220 --> 00:36:19,540
Do you like every style of...

622
00:36:19,540 --> 00:36:20,980
I like every style of everything.

623
00:36:20,980 --> 00:36:23,660
What is a New Hampshire... a turkey sandwich?

624
00:36:23,660 --> 00:36:25,460
Don't even start on turkey sandwiches.

625
00:36:25,460 --> 00:36:27,100
Okay, you are a snob.

626
00:36:27,100 --> 00:36:28,580
Back off, man. Back the fuck up.

627
00:36:28,580 --> 00:36:29,580
Back the fuck up.

628
00:36:29,580 --> 00:36:30,580
I'm sorry.

629
00:36:30,580 --> 00:36:31,860
You don't know a single thing about Thanksgiving sandwiches.

630
00:36:31,860 --> 00:36:40,380
Let me pop off about barbecue real quick. Y'all, I do not want to eat brisket anymore.

631
00:36:40,380 --> 00:36:48,460
Stop making so much fucking brisket. I want ribs. I don't like beef ribs. I like pork

632
00:36:48,460 --> 00:36:54,820
ribs. Pork ribs are the best. And also, I think that a hamburger should be a barbecue

633
00:36:54,820 --> 00:36:59,280
food. You eat it at a barbecue. That's not a bad idea. There should be hamburgers at

634
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:02,980
barbecue should have a burger fest soon. I burger fest. I'm gonna have a

635
00:37:02,980 --> 00:37:06,480
I'm eating a burger fest tonight. Okay. I already planned it yesterday. I

636
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:08,880
don't care. What did you have? What kind of burgers? You're the one who

637
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:12,400
brought up a burger. We could go to Brian's house before I even brought

638
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:16,440
I'm doing a blind mate home made, but it's not for me that I don't care.

639
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:22,400
What burgers are you making? I'm gonna do. I actually don't even want to

640
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:25,760
tell you. Are they deluxe? Are they? They're kind of the opposite of

641
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:27,760
the Deluxe, but you're going to make fun of me.

642
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:33,260
They're smash burgers, but I use 93% lean ground beef and I put it on a piece

643
00:37:33,260 --> 00:37:34,440
of lettuce instead of a bun.

644
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:39,240
I didn't want to tell you. I didn't want to tell you.

645
00:37:39,240 --> 00:37:41,800
I didn't want to tell you what I was doing, dude.

646
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:46,160
You were so excited. So, Cameron. You're having a burger fest tonight?

647
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:47,280
Cameron, it's...

648
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:54,760
I'm having a burger fest. So, it's my kind of a burger fest. I can't... No,

649
00:37:54,800 --> 00:38:00,240
man. No, you were having you're having a burger play date. You're having a

650
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:04,780
burger, a burger nap, take the headphones off Cameron. He cannot fucking come to

651
00:38:04,780 --> 00:38:08,360
our burger. No, absolutely not. He does not get what it's about. He cannot come

652
00:38:08,360 --> 00:38:12,080
to the burger. No, no, no, I might have a burger fest in one and a half weeks.

653
00:38:12,080 --> 00:38:14,760
That's a good idea. Okay, his headphones are back on.

654
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:19,440
It's a it's still a burger just because there's no, I don't want to hear about

655
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:21,960
and I don't want to hear about that. That thing you made

656
00:38:24,040 --> 00:38:25,640
you've been planning that thing

657
00:38:25,640 --> 00:38:30,440
I plan all my meals out.

658
00:38:30,440 --> 00:38:36,900
Is that such a crime and Wednesday? I mean I'm a burger, no bun

659
00:38:36,900 --> 00:38:38,800
honey,

660
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:45,100
I won't need the buns, but they give me diarrhea. I'm going to the grocery

661
00:38:45,100 --> 00:38:47,400
store. You think yeah, don't buy buns, do not

662
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:51,000
I need a bib of lettuce

663
00:38:52,700 --> 00:38:56,240
Or four of them actually, because I'll eat two burgers.

664
00:38:56,240 --> 00:38:59,880
And one for the top and one for the bottom because they are nature's bun.

665
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:04,980
You know what, you're going to, I think that I may, well okay, at least I'm not, I'm using

666
00:39:04,980 --> 00:39:10,660
buns on these, but my girlfriend wanted turkey burgers the other day and I made some pretty

667
00:39:10,660 --> 00:39:12,060
dope ass turkey burgers.

668
00:39:12,060 --> 00:39:13,380
I don't like turkey burgers, man.

669
00:39:13,380 --> 00:39:14,380
I get it.

670
00:39:14,380 --> 00:39:16,380
Just get a lean ground beef instead of a turkey burger.

671
00:39:16,380 --> 00:39:17,540
I get it, I get it.

672
00:39:17,540 --> 00:39:19,280
She just doesn't eat red meat.

673
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:20,280
Just make her eat it though.

674
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:21,280
I was just making, I should have just said.

675
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:28,280
I should have said, I should have said, I should have said, I should have said, I should have

676
00:39:28,280 --> 00:39:30,280
said, I should have said, I should have said, I should have said, I should have said, I

677
00:39:30,280 --> 00:39:31,280
should have said, I should have said, I should have said, I should have said, I should have

678
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:32,280
said, I should have said, I should have said, I should have said, I should have said, I

679
00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:33,280
should have said, I should have said, I should have said, I should have said, I should have

680
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:34,280
said, I should have said, I should have said, I should have said, I should have said, I

681
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:35,280
should have said, I should have said, I should have said, I should have said, I should have

682
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:36,280
said, I should have said, I should have said, I should have said, I should have said, I

683
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:40,840
asshole. I think it's not real, but yeah, that is a if that's real, I don't think

684
00:39:40,840 --> 00:39:44,520
any of that stuff is ever real. Right. Oh yeah. You want your wife to go into the

685
00:39:44,520 --> 00:39:47,880
bathroom and just fucking shit her brains out? Nah, it won't do that. What are you

686
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:50,960
talking about? When you're like vegetarian for a while and then you eat

687
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:54,880
like meat? This is a complete myth. What do you do? I did that. You were

688
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:59,480
vegetarian for like two months? I was pescatarian for a year. Did you just eat

689
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:02,360
something else? And then I went and ate a bunch of ribs. Actually, you know what? I

690
00:40:02,360 --> 00:40:07,360
went to Kowloon and saw Gus Madsen and I ate a bunch of spare ribs.

691
00:40:07,360 --> 00:40:09,960
A beef tallow is not enough to make you sick.

692
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:10,960
That's true, yeah.

693
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:11,960
It's just oil.

694
00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:14,760
It just violates your values and ruins your world view.

695
00:40:14,760 --> 00:40:15,760
Yeah, exactly.

696
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:16,760
Values don't matter.

697
00:40:16,760 --> 00:40:19,560
I think that's what made me shit was the fact that my values were gone.

698
00:40:19,560 --> 00:40:20,920
Yeah, that is satisfying.

699
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:22,960
The body reacts when its ethics are violated.

700
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:24,960
Maybe I'll start being vegan again.

701
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:28,760
Well, speaking of the turkey burgers, I made a very good cranberry mayo for the turkey

702
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:31,360
burgers and I forgot how good that is.

703
00:40:31,360 --> 00:40:37,680
Nobody needs to be eating cranberry with their turkey. I don't like this shit.

704
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:43,400
You are, this is why I said do not even talk about the Thanksgiving sandwich.

705
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:44,880
I don't like the Thanksgiving sandwich.

706
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:47,560
Thanksgiving sandwich is goaded for the days after Thanksgiving.

707
00:40:47,560 --> 00:40:48,560
Yes.

708
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:49,560
You really think that?

709
00:40:49,560 --> 00:40:50,560
You really think that, you know what?

710
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:52,280
Making a little Thanksgiving burger, no stuffing.

711
00:40:52,280 --> 00:40:55,640
Tell me, do you like Thanksgiving food?

712
00:40:55,640 --> 00:40:57,760
The stuffing is in the turkey patty.

713
00:40:57,760 --> 00:40:58,760
Yeah, the stuffing is part of it.

714
00:40:58,760 --> 00:41:01,480
I would say that you basically put all the stuffing ingredients in the

715
00:41:01,480 --> 00:41:05,400
turkey patty. I would say that Thanksgiving food, you think it's just

716
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:09,360
turkey and cranberry? No, my burger. Thanksgiving food is the fourth best

717
00:41:09,360 --> 00:41:14,040
holiday food. I don't like Thanksgiving food that much, but Halloween, yeah,

718
00:41:14,040 --> 00:41:16,560
those are the... Wait, how are you having any difference between... Christmas,

719
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:18,560
what's the difference? We eat lasagna and meatballs. Is it 'cause you get

720
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:22,120
coffee cake in the morning? Oh, alright. Well, that's your Christmas,

721
00:41:22,120 --> 00:41:25,280
that's not... Yeah, that is weird. I would not call that Christmas. If you

722
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:28,840
look up Christmas dinner right now. You're going to see like a goose or

723
00:41:28,840 --> 00:41:29,200
like

724
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:30,440
cooked goose or

725
00:41:30,440 --> 00:41:37,160
exactly. That's what I was going to or like or like or like porridge and now

726
00:41:37,160 --> 00:41:40,880
what the fuck are you talking Christmas? There a cooked goose. Who the hell

727
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:44,440
eats a turkey for Christmas? A lot of people. That's what Christmas dinner is.

728
00:41:44,440 --> 00:41:47,000
If you say Christmas dinner, that's what it means. Christmas dinner,

729
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:50,320
olive and mother fucking who will Christmas dinner and thanksgiving and

730
00:41:50,320 --> 00:41:53,080
this, but this is what it means. What do you mean? We live? No, you don't

731
00:41:53,120 --> 00:41:57,080
to live in a bill to eat roast be. This dinner is look at me, balls,

732
00:41:57,080 --> 00:41:58,960
meatballs, cheesecake,

733
00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:02,260
yes, he's got bread sauce,

734
00:42:02,260 --> 00:42:07,720
that's Christmas dinner. Yeah, we make it every Christmas. You just have a

735
00:42:07,720 --> 00:42:09,740
family fun. You're just a tally.

736
00:42:09,740 --> 00:42:13,100
That's like you're talking about. Do you guys like Monday dinner or do you

737
00:42:13,100 --> 00:42:13,400
guys like

738
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:19,680
Friday is pizza Friday is pizza, but thanksgiving the only universal.

739
00:42:19,720 --> 00:42:23,740
fourth. It's Christmas, the lasagna, the meatballs, Halloween, the candy, fourth

740
00:42:23,740 --> 00:42:28,420
of July, the hot dogs and the hamburgers, and then Thanksgiving rounding out the

741
00:42:28,420 --> 00:42:31,300
bottom. Wait, you're forgetting the birthday cake on fourth of July, man.

742
00:42:31,300 --> 00:42:33,920
Valentine's Day. We have that every fourth of July in my family.

743
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:39,540
Okay, then I'll include it. I'm not such a snob. I'm not so... I like July 23rd

744
00:42:39,540 --> 00:42:43,940
dinner the best. Why don't we just all adopt the best family traditions of each

745
00:42:43,940 --> 00:42:48,020
of our families? You guys can take the meatball and the... Do you guys want to

746
00:42:48,040 --> 00:42:52,280
you watch my uncle's meat balls. If we're doing all the family traditions of

747
00:42:52,280 --> 00:42:55,360
Christmas from when we were growing up, do you guys want to watch my uncle's

748
00:42:55,360 --> 00:43:01,040
fight? Yes, and I want your grandpa's leg. Oh yeah, fake leg. We should have

749
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:01,560
the leg.

750
00:43:01,560 --> 00:43:03,320
I talked about

751
00:43:03,320 --> 00:43:08,120
we got presents every year. I have not tried that, but I'll take it just to

752
00:43:08,120 --> 00:43:14,200
the remind the leg thing. My great my mom's grandpa was like diabetic or

753
00:43:14,240 --> 00:43:19,360
something and lost his leg. And then when he died every Christmas, they would wrap

754
00:43:19,360 --> 00:43:24,240
his leg up in Christmas ornaments and tinsel and stuff, and they would make us

755
00:43:24,240 --> 00:43:26,860
take photos with it. That's just a reminder.

756
00:43:26,860 --> 00:43:27,860
A fake leg.

757
00:43:27,860 --> 00:43:28,860
A fake leg.

758
00:43:28,860 --> 00:43:30,360
How high up did it go? Did it go past the knee?

759
00:43:30,360 --> 00:43:31,860
Yeah, dude. It was like...

760
00:43:31,860 --> 00:43:32,860
Whoa!

761
00:43:32,860 --> 00:43:36,860
It's like the... It would connect to the knee. So that's where like the strap.

762
00:43:36,860 --> 00:43:37,860
Oh, yeah. The hinge?

763
00:43:37,860 --> 00:43:41,860
Yeah, the strap and the hinge. So with that leg, cornucopia style.

764
00:43:41,860 --> 00:43:45,160
you could just connect one of those to your foot and have a three jointed long

765
00:43:45,160 --> 00:43:45,680
leg.

766
00:43:45,680 --> 00:43:50,800
That's also true. We could do a race. Yeah, still exactly. If we're combining

767
00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:53,860
all the traditions, we still have to have the leg in there. I was thinking

768
00:43:53,860 --> 00:43:57,020
cornucopia. A long legged race. A long legged race. We could do a long legged

769
00:43:57,020 --> 00:43:58,660
race with one person. Yeah. Yeah.

770
00:43:58,660 --> 00:44:04,100
All of everyone versus the one guy with a leg attached to his leg.

771
00:44:04,100 --> 00:44:07,180
Kind of a cybernetics experiment. Yeah.

772
00:44:07,180 --> 00:44:11,540
And then what other ones? So we got to watch my uncle's fight. Watch him

773
00:44:11,580 --> 00:44:17,460
with toys. The leg, playing with toys is good. We go get a tour of my Uncle Matt's new audio

774
00:44:17,460 --> 00:44:20,700
equipment. You guys ever do a Yankee swap? That's actually sick. You ever do a Yankee

775
00:44:20,700 --> 00:44:26,940
swap, Pat? No. What's that? That's like a game where everyone puts a small present into

776
00:44:26,940 --> 00:44:32,180
a pool and then it's like you go in an order and it's like the first person, and then you

777
00:44:32,180 --> 00:44:36,260
can either take a present or you can switch with someone else. Isn't that what White Elephant

778
00:44:36,260 --> 00:44:40,860
is? I don't know. Is it the same thing? We call it Yankee swap probably because we're

779
00:44:40,860 --> 00:44:44,300
We're a couple of Yankees.

780
00:44:44,300 --> 00:44:45,300
You guys are Yankees.

781
00:44:45,300 --> 00:44:49,900
Well that's our accent when we say that.

782
00:44:49,900 --> 00:44:52,160
You kind of have a southern accent for some reason.

783
00:44:52,160 --> 00:44:53,160
I don't have a southern accent.

784
00:44:53,160 --> 00:44:54,160
You say like ain't.

785
00:44:54,160 --> 00:44:55,160
I don't say ain't.

786
00:44:55,160 --> 00:44:56,160
Yeah you do.

787
00:44:56,160 --> 00:44:59,820
You add in a southern accent.

788
00:44:59,820 --> 00:45:00,820
You're a faker.

789
00:45:00,820 --> 00:45:01,820
That's the thing.

790
00:45:01,820 --> 00:45:02,820
The south taking over.

791
00:45:02,820 --> 00:45:03,820
The south is third coast baby.

792
00:45:03,820 --> 00:45:09,280
the third coast. I fully second for a split second. I was like no, I say aunt.

793
00:45:09,280 --> 00:45:18,100
I fully submit to the south. I'm ready to I bow down to China and I bow down to

794
00:45:18,100 --> 00:45:20,960
the American south. I'm fully ready to be assimilated. I'll be their slave.

795
00:45:20,960 --> 00:45:25,220
Imagine that barbecue. Oh my God, that would be a man in a world where those

796
00:45:25,220 --> 00:45:29,380
two are the are I have dual citizenship in those two countries. Yeah, yes, that

797
00:45:29,400 --> 00:45:34,660
the in a no it's not the confetti all right, not anymore. The south is going

798
00:45:34,660 --> 00:45:38,160
to have a second civil war where the north is the bad guys. Yeah, I would oh

799
00:45:38,160 --> 00:45:39,420
I gotta be so amazing

800
00:45:39,420 --> 00:45:44,760
that would be so just to even if it just lasted for one day, we could just call

801
00:45:44,760 --> 00:45:50,460
it square and stop doing all this stuff in school yeah right. I just think this

802
00:45:50,460 --> 00:45:54,140
is a good idea. Let's just if you guys could just fake it for just one day man.

803
00:45:54,140 --> 00:45:56,020
It would really connect the country. I think

804
00:45:57,400 --> 00:46:02,440
you fake what? Fake a civil war just for one day. Just for one day be like, we need to

805
00:46:02,440 --> 00:46:07,080
get slaves up north. And then we'll just be like, what the hell? What are you talking

806
00:46:07,080 --> 00:46:11,280
about? And then the civil war will be over. We're taking you down. Yeah. And then we surrender.

807
00:46:11,280 --> 00:46:14,720
Yeah, exactly. See this would instantly wheel our country. That would completely wheel the

808
00:46:14,720 --> 00:46:20,960
country actually. Every division we have would be over. You're on team south. Yeah, I'd be

809
00:46:20,960 --> 00:46:24,840
team south. Of course. You're pro slaves? You're joining the north for this? What are

810
00:46:24,840 --> 00:46:27,540
what are you doing? What are you talking about? I thought you were saying that

811
00:46:27,540 --> 00:46:30,720
the slay, okay, I thought you were saying that it was the same team. See,

812
00:46:30,720 --> 00:46:34,140
this is perfect. The confusion would make it actually go a lot smoother,

813
00:46:34,140 --> 00:46:38,360
'cause if both sides think that they're good, this would completely cleanse

814
00:46:38,360 --> 00:46:42,960
America and everyone would be happy. Yeah, are the American person would ever

815
00:46:42,960 --> 00:46:48,140
be able to say, no person would ever be able to say that they have never seen

816
00:46:48,140 --> 00:46:51,740
racism in person, 'cause they live in Boston. Exactly, yeah. They'd never be

817
00:46:51,760 --> 00:46:54,080
able to make that excuse to try and crazy.

818
00:46:54,080 --> 00:46:59,400
People say that I said that people always say that people are not Boston,

819
00:46:59,400 --> 00:47:03,160
but the northeast people are always like yeah, like the south is racist as fuck

820
00:47:03,160 --> 00:47:07,600
yeah, that you hear that London, New Hampshire is the whitest place in the

821
00:47:07,600 --> 00:47:12,240
world. Every place in the northeast is extremely like yeah, of course it was

822
00:47:12,240 --> 00:47:15,760
very racist. Everyone there is fucking honky. I don't see racism because

823
00:47:15,760 --> 00:47:20,440
there's no black people in my city. Yeah, we need to make we need to do like

824
00:47:20,480 --> 00:47:24,220
in Atlanta, Maine. Yeah, that would be a good idea. Oh my God.

825
00:47:24,220 --> 00:47:27,780
Could you imagine lobster fishermen getting off their boats and going to like

826
00:47:27,780 --> 00:47:31,560
magic city in the middle of like Bar Harbor? I could see that. That would be

827
00:47:31,560 --> 00:47:35,900
amazing. Yeah, just a bunch of like Mainers just walking in like, oh, look at

828
00:47:35,900 --> 00:47:36,720
a boobs.

829
00:47:36,720 --> 00:47:41,640
Oh, this is awesome.

830
00:47:41,640 --> 00:47:46,160
Oh my God, a strip club with fucking lobster rolls like Atlanta. This is a

831
00:47:46,160 --> 00:47:47,560
great idea. Oh my God.

832
00:47:48,640 --> 00:47:54,640
If the southeast and the northeast could link up, we could change the world forever.

833
00:47:54,640 --> 00:48:00,640
In the most northeast states, the strip clubs have to keep their clothes on if they sell alcohol.

834
00:48:00,640 --> 00:48:03,640
The Gold Club in Manchester, Bedford actually.

835
00:48:03,640 --> 00:48:05,640
Why do they do it? What's the point of that?

836
00:48:05,640 --> 00:48:06,640
I don't know.

837
00:48:06,640 --> 00:48:11,640
Fun fact, the Gold Club is where they shot that scene in Mystery Team.

838
00:48:11,640 --> 00:48:15,640
I guess it's better to a horny pervert to go there than to not go anywhere at all.

839
00:48:15,640 --> 00:48:19,760
small yeah, but it's hard to not go anywhere. If you're complete pretty

840
00:48:19,760 --> 00:48:23,280
easy for some of these guys, you're complete horny degenerate pervert.

841
00:48:23,280 --> 00:48:25,160
Yeah, it's probably

842
00:48:25,160 --> 00:48:30,160
trip club type of guy that goes to a strip club, greasy horny pervert. Yeah

843
00:48:30,160 --> 00:48:35,240
works glasses. It's full going to a trip club on a day. Yeah, you're going to a

844
00:48:35,240 --> 00:48:37,800
strip club on a Tuesday in Bedford, New Hampshire.

845
00:48:37,800 --> 00:48:39,600
It's like all right.

846
00:48:39,600 --> 00:48:43,720
We should I don't they should spray them with pesticides.

847
00:48:43,720 --> 00:48:44,720
I

848
00:48:44,720 --> 00:48:48,480
you should have to go through like a like

849
00:48:48,480 --> 00:48:53,080
like an international space station, like cleaning routine. There's an air

850
00:48:53,080 --> 00:48:58,240
lock. If you're if you're in the north, if you're in like again, Bedford, New

851
00:48:58,240 --> 00:49:01,160
Hampshire or something like that, and you were going to like a strip club on a

852
00:49:01,160 --> 00:49:05,040
Tuesday, they should remember when they were doing the drive through strip clubs

853
00:49:05,040 --> 00:49:08,520
when everything was locked down. No, I always thought that was a good idea.

854
00:49:08,520 --> 00:49:13,240
Window tent, who knows it was in that car, right? Maybe it's me. Maybe it's me

855
00:49:13,260 --> 00:49:18,320
I'm fifteen yeah. I got my learn permit. My mom's got to be in the car because I

856
00:49:18,320 --> 00:49:22,980
can't drive by myself. Yeah, I go. Oh Mom, I think I took a wrong turn. I might

857
00:49:22,980 --> 00:49:28,300
as well pay. I as well. We already your your you're pulling the fucking hand

858
00:49:28,300 --> 00:49:30,220
brake. So the car stalls yeah.

859
00:49:30,220 --> 00:49:35,000
My God, I just broke broke the whole car. You just here in the

860
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:42,700
fucking engine putting Drano and the oil. Oh, Reservoir, what the hell? How

861
00:49:42,740 --> 00:49:46,900
did we even get this far? There's a bunch of drain. Oh, the car broke down in the

862
00:49:46,900 --> 00:49:51,040
combination strip club movie theatre. Well, what that's what they were doing

863
00:49:51,040 --> 00:49:54,720
them. I don't know. Oh, probably not. I don't think I've ever drive through a

864
00:49:54,720 --> 00:49:57,860
movie. I don't think I've ever heard of a drive. That's a better idea than a

865
00:49:57,860 --> 00:50:03,520
drive in movie theatre, a drive through movie. Yeah, play every frame is on the

866
00:50:03,520 --> 00:50:08,820
is on a billboard. Yeah, you drive really fast and it animates it smart. Yeah, or

867
00:50:09,180 --> 00:50:13,980
it's a combination car wash, and so the movie plays while your car gets washed.

868
00:50:13,980 --> 00:50:14,980
It plays in the soap.

869
00:50:14,980 --> 00:50:20,180
The soap goes around your car and it's all the frames of the movie.

870
00:50:20,180 --> 00:50:23,180
Wait, that's actually genius. What do you mean? It drops down.

871
00:50:23,180 --> 00:50:26,280
So when the car gets covered in soap. It drops down like frames of soap.

872
00:50:26,280 --> 00:50:29,280
Because you know how the soap is different colors. Right.

873
00:50:29,280 --> 00:50:32,880
Like an oddly satisfying TikTok where they throw rice in the air and it makes a

874
00:50:32,880 --> 00:50:37,580
picture. Yeah. So it would be every frame is a layer of soap that is dropped

875
00:50:37,580 --> 00:50:42,780
down here, which it's like a New York playing all over your car. Yeah, it's a

876
00:50:42,780 --> 00:50:48,480
long, long drive through, but at the end and the rotating brushes do vibrations of

877
00:50:48,480 --> 00:50:53,600
the sound and their credits. This is the credits would still be in the on the

878
00:50:53,600 --> 00:50:57,540
tassels. The credits are the spaghetti that okay, that works the car at the end.

879
00:50:57,540 --> 00:50:58,060
I like

880
00:50:58,060 --> 00:51:00,180
yeah,

881
00:51:00,180 --> 00:51:04,980
there's a good idea. There's a really good idea. Yeah, you do have a lot of

882
00:51:05,020 --> 00:51:08,420
potential to get final destination in a three hour car wash, though. Oh,

883
00:51:08,420 --> 00:51:11,700
absolutely. I mean, at some point, you're going to want to smoke a cigarette

884
00:51:11,700 --> 00:51:15,100
because you're in your car. Yeah, what about how are you handling? You just go

885
00:51:15,100 --> 00:51:18,380
open the window. If your car doesn't have a bathroom in it, buddy, it's

886
00:51:18,380 --> 00:51:21,900
twenty, twenty, what the hell is wrong with you? What are you doing, bro?

887
00:51:21,900 --> 00:51:25,860
Yeah, you are not going to make it. That's another amazing business idea for

888
00:51:25,860 --> 00:51:30,340
us to start car bathroom, a car. Well, no, not a bathroom. A car bathroom might

889
00:51:30,340 --> 00:51:34,140
work, too. Well, they sell them at like right aid. You can just get like a

890
00:51:34,140 --> 00:51:36,140
You can get a portable urinal.

891
00:51:36,140 --> 00:51:38,140
You mean a bucket?

892
00:51:38,140 --> 00:51:42,140
No, no, no, no. It's a little tube and it fits both penises and vaginers.

893
00:51:42,140 --> 00:51:44,140
What are you talking about?

894
00:51:44,140 --> 00:51:47,140
How do you find the hole for a vagina to do a catheter?

895
00:51:47,140 --> 00:51:49,140
Basically, you just drop it out.

896
00:51:49,140 --> 00:51:51,140
You just let all the pee flop out.

897
00:51:51,140 --> 00:51:53,140
That's what happens. It comes out of both sides.

898
00:51:53,140 --> 00:51:56,140
Are you being real? They sell this at Rite Aid?

899
00:51:56,140 --> 00:51:57,140
What are you talking about?

900
00:51:57,140 --> 00:51:58,140
A portable urinal.

901
00:51:58,140 --> 00:52:00,140
How do girls pee so fast?

902
00:52:00,140 --> 00:52:04,140
It's basically, have you ever cut an orange in half and then squeezed it?

903
00:52:04,140 --> 00:52:14,140
(laughter)

904
00:52:14,140 --> 00:52:18,140
That is so true. That is crazy.

905
00:52:18,140 --> 00:52:20,140
That's what it looks like.

906
00:52:20,140 --> 00:52:23,140
How did you lighten that so lighteningly fast?

907
00:52:23,140 --> 00:52:25,140
That's what it looks like when a girl pees.

908
00:52:25,140 --> 00:52:26,140
It looks like.

909
00:52:26,140 --> 00:52:28,140
Because it comes out of all the parts of it.

910
00:52:28,140 --> 00:52:31,240
squeezing orange on your face. It's like that

911
00:52:31,240 --> 00:52:36,680
oh my God. No it does come out like that. They it takes them like two seconds to

912
00:52:36,680 --> 00:52:38,700
pee yeah and I'll just yeah. Did you

913
00:52:38,700 --> 00:52:40,100
make oh my

914
00:52:40,100 --> 00:52:49,000
that's the sound it makes when it's better. It takes me forever to fucking

915
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:55,540
pee. I'm getting worried. My dog, Phil, male dog, peas like a girl dog. Wow girl

916
00:52:55,580 --> 00:52:59,880
dogs and male dogs, P and random type sometimes, but he some dogs even with

917
00:52:59,880 --> 00:53:01,140
flip upside down to P.

918
00:53:01,140 --> 00:53:06,260
My kind of dog you have seen my child. They do they walk on their front legs

919
00:53:06,260 --> 00:53:10,180
and they bring their back legs up over their head. My childhood dog feel

920
00:53:10,180 --> 00:53:12,020
that's not true

921
00:53:12,020 --> 00:53:13,560
dog.

922
00:53:13,560 --> 00:53:21,080
You've never seen this before. No, I've never seen this crazy weirdo dog. P

923
00:53:21,080 --> 00:53:25,540
dog. There's so many never seen this video. No, I've seen this video

924
00:53:25,560 --> 00:53:31,380
probably 300 times. What the fuck? Why is he drinking the dog's pee? No, this is an

925
00:53:31,380 --> 00:53:31,840
adverse.

926
00:53:31,840 --> 00:53:36,800
Smoothie. Oh, an ad bro. Come on my bad. I'm going to a smoothie king in a while.

927
00:53:36,800 --> 00:53:39,200
I don't think they have them. I don't even know what that is. I thought it was

928
00:53:39,200 --> 00:53:42,120
Chick-fil-a based on the colors. And yes, I'm cup. You never been to smoothie

929
00:53:42,120 --> 00:53:47,000
king. No, that's a southern thing. I don't is it so the smoothie king is like

930
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:52,880
this is like Jamba juice. I'd say about 60% of dogs pee this way. That can't be

931
00:53:52,880 --> 00:53:55,880
future. I've never seen this once in my life and I hang around dogs all day.

932
00:53:55,880 --> 00:53:56,920
Wow,

933
00:53:56,920 --> 00:54:02,520
it's not it's not a stupid dog. It's not a remarkable. They should put they

934
00:54:02,520 --> 00:54:04,000
should put another head on the dog.

935
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:08,240
Remarkable, they should put another head on that dog, but and then you don't

936
00:54:08,240 --> 00:54:11,360
think this is a little bit interesting. This is completely don't find this

937
00:54:11,360 --> 00:54:14,200
unique. This is mundane. Why'd they take the video then?

938
00:54:14,200 --> 00:54:17,680
It's probably just one of those accounts that take videos or whatever

939
00:54:17,680 --> 00:54:18,320
they see.

940
00:54:20,920 --> 00:54:24,560
I guess it could be one of the other videos on here. It's probably going to

941
00:54:24,560 --> 00:54:29,860
be like sandwich. I saw yeah, maybe the fire works at the fair sign. I saw when

942
00:54:29,860 --> 00:54:35,640
I drove next to the road or I drove on the road. I mean there my my mom and my

943
00:54:35,640 --> 00:54:37,580
mom and dad's old dog, Charlie.

944
00:54:37,580 --> 00:54:44,140
He got bullied into being normal by the by our older dog. What does that mean?

945
00:54:44,140 --> 00:54:47,100
How did he pee before he would pee sitting down and then I well, I guess he

946
00:54:47,100 --> 00:54:50,900
just I guess he wasn't bullied, but I guess he just saw the how the other dog

947
00:54:50,900 --> 00:54:55,300
peed some male dogs peed with the squat and some female dogs lift the leg. He

948
00:54:55,300 --> 00:54:58,900
was peeing with the squat forever and then he saw another dog. Pee P's with the

949
00:54:58,900 --> 00:55:00,940
squat. It's he's a very self conscious dog.

950
00:55:00,940 --> 00:55:05,540
I think the squat is really funny because it's like trying to get their P as

951
00:55:05,540 --> 00:55:08,540
close as possible to the ground and shoot it straight forward. It's still

952
00:55:08,540 --> 00:55:12,620
sply. This morning. I was I was just really tired and I took the dog out to

953
00:55:12,620 --> 00:55:16,860
pee and he peed on the ground and I had my Crocs on no socks. By the way, peed

954
00:55:16,900 --> 00:55:19,220
in your shoes, no socks, piss all in my shoes,

955
00:55:19,220 --> 00:55:25,000
everywhere on me, getting in your shoes. He pissed up in my my kicks,

956
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:29,660
getting an animal in your shoes, excrement on you is not good. I think

957
00:55:29,660 --> 00:55:32,860
it's normal. I'll say it happens all the time. I'm not a fan of it,

958
00:55:32,860 --> 00:55:36,060
but I don't care. Sometimes I pick up the poop and I like it and

959
00:55:36,060 --> 00:55:38,340
I get a little poop on my finger and I have to just hold

960
00:55:38,340 --> 00:55:40,740
my finger up like this until I get to the park. You can

961
00:55:40,740 --> 00:55:43,860
go through the plastic of a dog bag as well. The glove technique,

962
00:55:43,900 --> 00:55:48,060
it's giving you dog germs that will turn you into a dog. I hate the dog bag

963
00:55:48,060 --> 00:55:52,820
technique. What technique would you use? I hate, I don't wanna own a dog because

964
00:55:52,820 --> 00:55:54,620
I don't wanna pick up poop. You could have an animal poop in your house.

965
00:55:54,620 --> 00:55:57,540
You could put the... I'd rather have an animal poop in a thing where I

966
00:55:57,540 --> 00:55:59,920
can scoop it up. No, I like touching the dog's poop through plastic to

967
00:55:59,920 --> 00:56:03,680
experiment with the texture. Sometimes it's unhealthy and you have to call the

968
00:56:03,680 --> 00:56:07,400
vet. It's crazy the different textures that you can feel. It makes me imagine

969
00:56:07,400 --> 00:56:10,580
what it would feel like if I picked up my different poops every day.

970
00:56:10,860 --> 00:56:16,900
and I think about an issue. Well, that's the thing. Sometimes you get happy to

971
00:56:16,900 --> 00:56:20,100
pick one up because it's so simple. Do you think all poop feels like that or do

972
00:56:20,100 --> 00:56:25,620
you think that because we drop it into water, it changes the texture? That's a

973
00:56:25,620 --> 00:56:27,840
good question. That is a really good question. Have you guys ever done an

974
00:56:27,840 --> 00:56:31,380
outside poop? Yeah. Probably once or twice, but I can't remember any specific

975
00:56:31,380 --> 00:56:35,440
instances. When I was a kid, when I was six years old, I thought that I was

976
00:56:35,440 --> 00:56:40,500
hiding it, but I went, I was out playing and then I had to shit so bad.

977
00:56:40,500 --> 00:56:46,300
that I just like drop trow and pooped in the middle of the woods and then wiped

978
00:56:46,300 --> 00:56:51,620
with a leaf and looked up at my cousin Megan was watching the whole thing.

979
00:56:51,620 --> 00:56:52,120
Dude.

980
00:56:52,120 --> 00:56:57,920
And she was like, "Did you just fucking poop?" And I went, "Yeah."

981
00:56:57,920 --> 00:57:04,360
I was obsessed with shitting outside when I was a kid. I had a...

982
00:57:04,360 --> 00:57:05,200
Oh, we know.

983
00:57:05,200 --> 00:57:07,200
There's a tree behind my house.

984
00:57:07,200 --> 00:57:08,200
Oh, you told us about this.

985
00:57:08,200 --> 00:57:09,840
where I would go, I called it my fort,

986
00:57:09,840 --> 00:57:12,280
but it was just a branch that I took shits off of.

987
00:57:12,280 --> 00:57:13,720
(laughing)

988
00:57:13,720 --> 00:57:14,560
It's cool.

989
00:57:14,560 --> 00:57:15,380
- Yeah.

990
00:57:15,380 --> 00:57:16,220
- It was so cool.

991
00:57:16,220 --> 00:57:17,720
And then I would tell people like, yeah, that's my fort.

992
00:57:17,720 --> 00:57:19,040
And like friends would come over

993
00:57:19,040 --> 00:57:20,840
and there'd just be a big pile of my shit

994
00:57:20,840 --> 00:57:22,120
right under the branch.

995
00:57:22,120 --> 00:57:25,120
(laughing)

996
00:57:25,120 --> 00:57:25,960
It was cool, man.

997
00:57:25,960 --> 00:57:26,780
- Yeah.

998
00:57:26,780 --> 00:57:28,760
- I wish that I had had a tree house growing up.

999
00:57:28,760 --> 00:57:29,600
- Me too, man.

1000
00:57:29,600 --> 00:57:30,780
- I thought that I had a tree house,

1001
00:57:30,780 --> 00:57:34,040
but my neighbor just drilled a plank of wood to the tree.

1002
00:57:34,040 --> 00:57:35,240
- That is a tree house.

1003
00:57:35,240 --> 00:57:36,680
- Well, I guess it, I mean, I don't know.

1004
00:57:36,680 --> 00:57:37,520
- If you could stand on it.

1005
00:57:37,520 --> 00:57:38,520
You could go up into it.

1006
00:57:38,520 --> 00:57:39,520
It was a treehouse.

1007
00:57:39,520 --> 00:57:41,000
You could go, yeah, you could stand on it.

1008
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:42,000
So I guess that is a treehouse.

1009
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:47,960
My treehouse was that there were two knots in the tree that were, in the tree in my yard

1010
00:57:47,960 --> 00:57:51,840
that were about six inches off the ground that I would stand in like they were footholds.

1011
00:57:51,840 --> 00:57:52,840
Ah, whoa.

1012
00:57:52,840 --> 00:57:55,000
And I would imagine I was in a treehouse.

1013
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:59,280
My, there's, we had two, then the other one, I mean, you've all seen the video of my little

1014
00:57:59,280 --> 00:58:01,800
brother breaking his arm on the swing.

1015
00:58:01,800 --> 00:58:04,240
That was our other treehouse, was just a...

1016
00:58:04,240 --> 00:58:05,240
Just a swing on a tree?

1017
00:58:05,240 --> 00:58:10,600
a swing on a tree that had like, I think he put like a another plank of wood there.

1018
00:58:10,600 --> 00:58:15,080
I only went on a tire swing I think one time at my grandparents house and then the branch

1019
00:58:15,080 --> 00:58:17,640
broke and it hit me in the head and I got a concussion.

1020
00:58:17,640 --> 00:58:18,640
Damn.

1021
00:58:18,640 --> 00:58:19,640
Because I was too fat.

1022
00:58:19,640 --> 00:58:20,640
Damn.

1023
00:58:20,640 --> 00:58:24,720
You know what would have been goaded to have as a kid in my yard?

1024
00:58:24,720 --> 00:58:25,720
Tether ball.

1025
00:58:25,720 --> 00:58:26,720
Tether ball would have been dope.

1026
00:58:26,720 --> 00:58:27,720
Real shit.

1027
00:58:27,720 --> 00:58:28,720
Yep.

1028
00:58:28,720 --> 00:58:29,720
Real shit.

1029
00:58:29,720 --> 00:58:30,720
Because that's a game you can play by yourself.

1030
00:58:30,720 --> 00:58:31,720
Yep.

1031
00:58:31,720 --> 00:58:32,720
Yeah, you just got to get the ball and the tether.

1032
00:58:32,720 --> 00:58:33,720
I would have been out there playing tether ball all day.

1033
00:58:33,720 --> 00:58:42,000
Excuse me. What the fuck? Two burps in a row is crazy. Do you remember, no you guys were

1034
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:50,080
long gone by then. I think I've talked to you guys about this. I had that house warming

1035
00:58:50,080 --> 00:58:53,960
party that one time and then I was trying to kick everyone out of my house because I

1036
00:58:53,960 --> 00:58:55,040
got really tired.

1037
00:58:55,040 --> 00:58:57,440
Long gone means 30 minutes by the way.

1038
00:58:57,440 --> 00:59:01,880
Yeah. Well, yeah. But I was trying to kick everyone out and then while I was kicking everyone

1039
00:59:01,880 --> 00:59:06,720
right now. Tommy says that he's he's told a million people about this, but I was

1040
00:59:06,720 --> 00:59:12,660
trying to kick people out. I was hammered and I just had a burp attack that was in

1041
00:59:12,660 --> 00:59:16,160
the middle of your talking in the middle. I was like, hey, thank you, thank you

1042
00:59:16,160 --> 00:59:16,760
everyone for

1043
00:59:16,760 --> 00:59:18,720
hey guys, when I

1044
00:59:18,720 --> 00:59:20,860
and like Rick,

1045
00:59:20,860 --> 00:59:27,720
you raked on a Rick dude, I was raking like crazy. I literally, I couldn't talk

1046
00:59:27,720 --> 00:59:28,920
for like, like

1047
00:59:29,760 --> 00:59:33,760
20 seconds. If I was there, I'd be like, "Jeez, Rick, I don't know if I want to leave your party."

1048
00:59:33,760 --> 00:59:37,760
I would have made fun of you for raking. I would have gotten so many fucking laughs.

1049
00:59:37,760 --> 00:59:41,760
I would have crushed the party. I think that I was about to throw up and I didn't realize it.

1050
00:59:41,760 --> 00:59:45,760
Because I was getting crazy.

1051
00:59:45,760 --> 00:59:49,760
I got crazy on him. Are you guys going to, when the strike's over, you guys going to go out for the Rick voice?

1052
00:59:49,760 --> 00:59:53,760
Yes. Have they not already found anybody?

1053
00:59:53,760 --> 00:59:57,760
We got to go to space, Murdy. Murdy?

1054
00:59:57,760 --> 01:00:02,060
sounds like Rick. No, well, I would try and take the voice back to the roots of

1055
01:00:02,060 --> 01:00:04,420
the character, and I would think, well, this guy's supposed to be a scientist,

1056
01:00:04,420 --> 01:00:06,960
so I'd do something along the lines. Morty, it seems that we have to do an

1057
01:00:06,960 --> 01:00:09,300
experiment today. Here's what I would do, actually, now that I'm remembering.

1058
01:00:09,300 --> 01:00:12,020
Indubitably, Morty. Now that I'm remembering, he's a scientist and not

1059
01:00:12,020 --> 01:00:13,160
just a drunk uncle.

1060
01:00:13,160 --> 01:00:14,720
I would probably...

1061
01:00:14,720 --> 01:00:20,960
Hey, Morty. That's not a scientist voice at all. I would change it to be...

1062
01:00:20,960 --> 01:00:24,400
It's according to my calculations, Morty. I feel like that show has become a

1063
01:00:24,440 --> 01:00:29,400
little bit to kind of roll. I was going to say a little too boomer, so I would

1064
01:00:29,400 --> 01:00:33,780
bring like a new, younger, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, Marty, we got to go on

1065
01:00:33,780 --> 01:00:38,020
instagram live, Morty, yeah, instead of burping, I go yeah, yeah,

1066
01:00:38,020 --> 01:00:42,200
more you hit your vape inside of burping, Morty, we need to watch the aid

1067
01:00:42,200 --> 01:00:44,180
and Ross stream tonight, Morty

1068
01:00:44,180 --> 01:00:49,280
Morty, Morty, we got to go back in that's actually good. We got to go back

1069
01:00:49,280 --> 01:00:54,040
in time and let every time in every time that Rick burps he moans after

1070
01:00:54,040 --> 01:00:54,540
Yeah.

1071
01:00:54,540 --> 01:00:58,040
Morty, we gotta go.

1072
01:00:58,040 --> 01:01:01,740
We gotta go to the Logan Paul Dylan Daniels fight, Morty.

1073
01:01:01,740 --> 01:01:07,540
Morty, we gotta, we've gotta, we gotta go back and we gotta,

1074
01:01:07,540 --> 01:01:09,740
we gotta save Jake and Logan's relationship, Morty.

1075
01:01:09,740 --> 01:01:12,740
We gotta save their relationship.

1076
01:01:12,740 --> 01:01:15,940
They're two brothers.

1077
01:01:15,940 --> 01:01:17,140
They're two brothers and they're fighting.

1078
01:01:17,140 --> 01:01:18,440
Whoa, two brothers.

1079
01:01:18,440 --> 01:01:19,240
They're beefing Morty.

1080
01:01:19,240 --> 01:01:21,340
They're two brothers and they're beefing Morty.

1081
01:01:21,340 --> 01:01:28,340
They're beefing brothers. They're beefing brothers and they're beefing way too hard.

1082
01:01:28,340 --> 01:01:34,700
You have an insanely good sexual moan.

1083
01:01:34,700 --> 01:01:35,100
Yeah?

1084
01:01:35,100 --> 01:01:40,180
I would have sex with you if you made that noise. It doesn't matter what you look like.

1085
01:01:40,180 --> 01:01:40,540
Okay.

1086
01:01:40,540 --> 01:01:44,500
Even if you were as ugly as you are right now, I would still have sex with you and that

1087
01:01:44,500 --> 01:01:44,860
moan would stay there.

1088
01:01:44,860 --> 01:01:47,660
You don't think the prisoner outfit that I'm still in is doing anything?

1089
01:01:47,660 --> 01:01:50,460
I said you looked good in the prison outfit and you immediately went and got changed into

1090
01:01:50,460 --> 01:01:50,580
it.

1091
01:01:50,580 --> 01:01:53,920
I got changed into it because I thought we were going to make a joke up top about how

1092
01:01:53,920 --> 01:01:55,340
I'm the only one still in prison.

1093
01:01:55,340 --> 01:01:56,620
That's your joke to make.

1094
01:01:56,620 --> 01:02:00,760
That was my joke to make and I guess I kind of let it steamroll, huh?

1095
01:02:00,760 --> 01:02:02,260
Let it steamroll.

1096
01:02:02,260 --> 01:02:03,260
Let it steamroll.

1097
01:02:03,260 --> 01:02:04,260
Let it steamroll.

1098
01:02:04,260 --> 01:02:05,260
Let it steamroll.

1099
01:02:05,260 --> 01:02:06,260
Let it steamroll.

1100
01:02:06,260 --> 01:02:07,260
Let it steamroll.

1101
01:02:07,260 --> 01:02:08,260
Ow, ow.

1102
01:02:08,260 --> 01:02:11,720
That does sound like some early like parliament funkadelic title.

1103
01:02:11,720 --> 01:02:12,720
Let it steamroll.

1104
01:02:12,720 --> 01:02:16,660
Guys, I'd just like to say this before we leave.

1105
01:02:16,660 --> 01:02:19,980
I'm sick of the hate that my wife is giving me

1106
01:02:19,980 --> 01:02:21,860
for playing Red Hot Chili Peppers in the house.

1107
01:02:21,860 --> 01:02:23,220
- I would give you the same hate.

1108
01:02:23,220 --> 01:02:25,060
I don't like that band that much.

1109
01:02:25,060 --> 01:02:25,900
- You just said that much,

1110
01:02:25,900 --> 01:02:27,340
so there is two songs that you like.

1111
01:02:27,340 --> 01:02:29,180
- Yep, it's the one from Power Rangers

1112
01:02:29,180 --> 01:02:32,740
and it's the one from, actually there's four songs.

1113
01:02:32,740 --> 01:02:34,900
♪ How low, how low ♪

1114
01:02:34,900 --> 01:02:35,740
- What's that one?

1115
01:02:35,740 --> 01:02:36,940
♪ Was like ♪

1116
01:02:36,940 --> 01:02:37,780
- What's that one where he's like,

1117
01:02:37,780 --> 01:02:39,940
"I got a baby named Adino"?

1118
01:02:39,940 --> 01:02:43,820
- That is, you're thinking of the Weird Al version

1119
01:02:43,820 --> 01:02:45,280
of that song.

1120
01:02:45,280 --> 01:02:46,540
- What?

1121
01:02:46,540 --> 01:02:50,140
Yeah, well, I got I got a baby named a Dino. Yeah, that's the Flintstones.

1122
01:02:50,140 --> 01:02:53,340
I feel like that's two different songs.

1123
01:02:53,340 --> 01:02:58,740
Bedrock. No, this is you're doing. This is a weird out song that you think is a

1124
01:02:58,740 --> 01:03:02,240
it's a cover. Not really by the peppers. No, no, no.

1125
01:03:02,240 --> 01:03:06,540
Weird out. Interesting. That's why it's funny. It's about the Flintstones.

1126
01:03:06,540 --> 01:03:08,640
I thought that they just like the Flintstones.

1127
01:03:08,640 --> 01:03:11,140
I mean, they probably do. Who doesn't like the Flintstones?

1128
01:03:11,140 --> 01:03:14,340
Well, I don't like the Flintstones. I'm playing one of them.

1129
01:03:14,340 --> 01:03:17,540
y'all that I get you my impression of a guy doesn't exist on the patron

1130
01:03:17,540 --> 01:03:21,180
episode. Did I get you? Did you believe that I didn't like the Flintstones?

1131
01:03:21,180 --> 01:03:24,300
When I said that I think you're going to be surprised that you will have to

1132
01:03:24,300 --> 01:03:26,220
crown me as a master troll.

1133
01:03:26,220 --> 01:03:36,740
I think what this comes out this Saturday, so then I guess on this comes

1134
01:03:36,740 --> 01:03:41,860
out last Saturday, the twenty eighth and the thirty first I'm in Pittsburgh and

1135
01:03:41,900 --> 01:03:47,900
Baltimore. Bodymore Murderland. Baltimore.

1136
01:03:47,900 --> 01:03:49,900
That was sick. That was actually sick.

1137
01:03:49,900 --> 01:03:51,900
I heard Jack say that one time.

1138
01:03:51,900 --> 01:03:53,900
I'm going to be in Cashington

1139
01:03:53,900 --> 01:03:55,900

1140
01:03:55,900 --> 01:03:57,900
Cashington Da Coin.

1141
01:03:57,900 --> 01:03:59,900

And then I'll be here.

1146
01:04:07,900 --> 01:04:09,900
Speaking of Jack, he just texted me.

1147
01:04:09,900 --> 01:04:15,300
Smoke he said come smoke at my house. That's beast all right. Bye. Bye. Bye
