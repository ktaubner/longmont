I'm sorry he's so stinky and sweaty.

5
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:15,000
That's right.

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Oh my god, I'm so sleazy and wheezy today.

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:17,500
Oh.

8
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:21,500
Oh guys, I don't want to record. I'm too slimy.

9
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:24,300
I am, dude. I'm sticking to the chair. I'm like...

10
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:25,500
You're like a fishman.

11
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:27,500
You're a mesh chair. How are you sticking to this thing?

12
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:29,500
The leather on the sides.

13
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:31,500
Wow, your beard flutters.

14
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:33,500
You hear that?

15
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:34,500
That's crazy.

16
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:37,500
Patrick's back hair is like Velcro hooks.

17
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:39,500
And it's attaching him to the mesh chair.

18
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:43,500
I went skating before I recorded.

19
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:46,500
And I sweat through my shirt and my shorts.

20
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:48,500
You were wearing all black.

21
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:50,500
Yeah, look, I didn't think anything through.

22
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:52,500
I thought it was raining today.

23
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:55,500
I thought it rained earlier.

24
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:57,500
Did the forecast call for rain?

25
00:00:57,500 --> 00:01:00,940
It rained earlier, but then it was just cloudy the rest of the day, but it was hot cloudy.

26
00:01:00,940 --> 00:01:02,060
I've been asleep.

27
00:01:02,060 --> 00:01:03,580
Yeah, hot cloudy is the worst.

28
00:01:03,580 --> 00:01:07,660
Hot cloudy sucks because it tricks you.

29
00:01:07,660 --> 00:01:08,140
Yeah.

30
00:01:08,140 --> 00:01:08,460
You look up.

31
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:11,260
Yeah, I got tricked into thinking, "Oh, today's a good day to go skate."

32
00:01:11,260 --> 00:01:12,460
That's why I don't like sunglasses.

33
00:01:12,460 --> 00:01:14,860
And then you end up all oozy and floozy all over the place.

34
00:01:14,860 --> 00:01:14,860
Yeah.

35
00:01:14,860 --> 00:01:15,420
Oh, god.

36
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:21,020
If I wear sunglasses, I get confused because I think it should feel brown in my body, but it just

37
00:01:21,020 --> 00:01:22,140
it only looks brown.

38
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:22,700
Right.

39
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:24,380
It's the same thing as a cloudy hot day.

40
00:01:24,380 --> 00:01:25,500
Yeah.

41
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:26,300
Where you look up.

42
00:01:26,300 --> 00:01:32,860
my tooth hurts so bad. What else is wrong with you? A lot. Yeah? Oh my teeth are so sweaty today.

43
00:01:32,860 --> 00:01:38,780
I think I chipped one of my teeth. I've been grinding my teeth a lot and I chipped one of them

44
00:01:38,780 --> 00:01:46,380
in my sleep I think and then another one. I think my wisdom teeth are coming in. I think

45
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:50,700
grinding your teeth is a good sign. I think it means you care. You know what I mean? It means

46
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:54,780
you have a strong jaw. Yeah it means you have a strong jaw, you're thinking of your small business,

47
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:56,780
You're like worried about stuff, you know?

48
00:01:56,780 --> 00:01:57,780
It's a good thing.

49
00:01:57,780 --> 00:01:59,620
Also, I mean, grinding your teeth, it's better.

50
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:03,100
That means you're dreaming about chewing something, which is better than dreaming about licking

51
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:04,100
something.

52
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:05,100
Yeah.

53
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:06,100
You could be dreaming about candy canes.

54
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:07,100
If you wake up and you're licking your bed, you...

55
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:08,100
Yeah.

56
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:09,100
You...

57
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:10,100
Candy canes are not a thing you chew.

58
00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:15,020
Yeah, 'cause you can explain grinding your teeth, even if you are getting like, in your

59
00:02:15,020 --> 00:02:17,340
dream you're getting like a blowjob from a shark.

60
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:19,700
Like when you wake up, you can explain that to your wife.

61
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:22,660
You can be like, "Oh, I'm grinding my teeth 'cause I'm thinking of like, oh, the door's

62
00:02:22,660 --> 00:02:23,660
unlocked.

63
00:02:23,660 --> 00:02:24,660
I'm so stressed."

64
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:28,660
up if she wakes up and you were like licking one of the poles of like your

65
00:02:28,660 --> 00:02:36,000
bed up and down and going on saying like you're your friend's dad's name oh my

66
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:41,180
god I just so stressed just that stress tree oh my god oh my god Barry baby I

67
00:02:41,180 --> 00:02:45,540
think I think I need to start meditating or something I gotta get a TM keep

68
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:49,860
having these horrible stress I keep having these night terrors where I'm

69
00:02:49,860 --> 00:03:01,420
going like oh yeah you're just like you have your phone in your mouth with the

70
00:03:01,420 --> 00:03:05,460
speaker like yes in your mouth and it's playing like fucking like what's that

71
00:03:05,460 --> 00:03:12,460
"Right about now, hit it!" That song, fucking, "It Takes Two"

72
00:03:12,460 --> 00:03:14,460
That's playing in your mouth, you're going like "Oh!"

73
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:18,460
You're going in sync with the "Yeah! Ow!"

74
00:03:18,460 --> 00:03:24,460
Yeah, in your sleep you've navigated to YouTube, found a lyric video for "It Takes Two"

75
00:03:24,460 --> 00:03:29,460
and then started playing it and sliding like... DJ Rob Bass and DJ Easy Rock

76
00:03:29,460 --> 00:03:35,060
rock and putting your wife's hand through your butt cheeks like a credit card.

77
00:03:35,060 --> 00:03:46,020
Yeah, he eats you example. What are you doing? Why'd you eat me? I've been having horrible night terrors.

78
00:03:46,020 --> 00:03:51,540
I'm an owner, I own the greatest hip-hop club in the world.

79
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:55,980
People are dancing and singing but then one night someone came in they brought

80
00:03:55,980 --> 00:04:01,980
an ecstasy and people were ODing. And that's why your hand was in my butt, I was trying

81
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:03,980
to get the ecstasy out of my butt.

82
00:04:03,980 --> 00:04:08,780
Yeah, but when I was rubbing my crotch against the doorknob, that was just from stress, that

83
00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:10,380
didn't have anything to do with the dream.

84
00:04:10,380 --> 00:04:11,980
That was pure stress.

85
00:04:11,980 --> 00:04:12,980
I was sleepwalking.

86
00:04:12,980 --> 00:04:14,380
It was just a release for me.

87
00:04:14,380 --> 00:04:18,300
I was stressed in my dream where I was my own Shay Patrick.

88
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:22,460
I'm not a sleepwalker, but I thrash around in my sleep a lot.

89
00:04:22,460 --> 00:04:23,460
You're a sleep thrasher?

90
00:04:23,460 --> 00:04:25,100
I'm a sleep thrasher and a sleep talker.

91
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:26,260
- He's doing like kick flip.

92
00:04:26,260 --> 00:04:28,660
- That's way cooler sounding.

93
00:04:28,660 --> 00:04:29,500
- It sucks.

94
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:30,320
- At least.

95
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:31,160
- Sleep thrasher.

96
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:33,960
- I wake up and all my sheets and covers are on the floor

97
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:35,840
and my girlfriend is angry.

98
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:37,020
- Yeah, it's bad.

99
00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:37,860
- What?

100
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:39,420
I think I told you guys this before, but yeah, I do.

101
00:04:39,420 --> 00:04:41,420
I'll like sit up in the middle of the night

102
00:04:41,420 --> 00:04:43,460
and like try and like be asleep,

103
00:04:43,460 --> 00:04:44,780
but try and wake up my girlfriend

104
00:04:44,780 --> 00:04:46,420
and tell her something while I'm asleep.

105
00:04:46,420 --> 00:04:48,540
And one time she said that I sat up in the middle of the night

106
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:50,420
and like, like shook her and was just said,

107
00:04:50,420 --> 00:04:51,520
"Lord of the Rings."

108
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:52,360
And then went back to sleep.

109
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:53,180
(laughing)

110
00:04:53,180 --> 00:04:54,380
- Dude.

111
00:04:54,380 --> 00:04:58,380
If I was dating I'd be, I would have my shit packed up by the time you got up.

112
00:04:58,380 --> 00:05:01,380
I would be, there would be boxes all over the house.

113
00:05:01,380 --> 00:05:03,380
I'm not living with Lord of the Rings, man.

114
00:05:03,380 --> 00:05:04,880
Dude, I can't do it.

115
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:09,380
I must be so horrible to sleep next to, 'cause I also have sleep apnea, so you know, I'm going like

116
00:05:09,380 --> 00:05:10,380
*snoring*

117
00:05:10,380 --> 00:05:17,380
Yeah, I'm the worst to sleep next to, 'cause every, like, my ex-girlfriend would tell me that, like, when I would, like,

118
00:05:17,380 --> 00:05:20,380
snore, it would sound like I was choking in my sleep.

119
00:05:20,380 --> 00:05:21,380
Yeah.

120
00:05:21,380 --> 00:05:23,700
So it's just like I'm sitting there just snoring just like

121
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:25,700
*snoring*

122
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:27,700
Dude, sleep apnea is terrible.

123
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:31,240
Yeah, it is terrible. I used to, in high school I would fall asleep on the couch and like

124
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:35,440
once I like, my mom woke me up because she thought I was dying because I was going

125
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:37,440
*snoring*

126
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:43,240
My ex would wake me up in the middle of the night just like, like, like can you not sleep on your side please?

127
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:49,240
Like, or no, no, no, if I sleep on my back, she's like, can you just, please just roll over like you, I know how to fix this, just do it.

128
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:52,440
I would get so mad because it was like somebody's trying to wake me up.

129
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:56,200
So if someone tries to wake me up, I guess this has happened before.

130
00:05:56,200 --> 00:06:00,200
Alex has been like, I've been, I've fallen asleep on the couch in the living room.

131
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:06,120
And I think I was watching fucking the Suicide Squad and I like was drunk and I just really

132
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:09,160
liked it. Sitting there just like, "This movie rules!"

133
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:15,320
He told me that from his room he heard Pat go like, "Yeah! This is awesome!"

134
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:17,580
(laughter)

135
00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:19,760
- In the middle of watching.

136
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:20,600
- I was pretty drunk.

137
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:21,420
- Oh yeah!

138
00:06:21,420 --> 00:06:22,260
Do it again!

139
00:06:22,260 --> 00:06:23,100
(laughter)

140
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:23,920
Come on!

141
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:24,760
- He's exaggerating.

142
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:25,600
- I'm pretty sure if I--

143
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:26,420
- He's exaggerating.

144
00:06:26,420 --> 00:06:27,920
- If I remember correctly, 'cause I--

145
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:30,480
- Hold on, let me finish the snoring thing.

146
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:32,440
- You reviewed it on Letterboxd,

147
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:33,780
and you were like, "Yeah, this was okay."

148
00:06:33,780 --> 00:06:36,120
- Yeah, I didn't take it or leave it.

149
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:37,280
- Yeah, it's so funny.

150
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:39,200
- He's throwing popcorn all over the place.

151
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:41,240
(laughter)

152
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:42,080
- Yeah!

153
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:42,900
- Two stars.

154
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:44,360
That's gonna be two stars for me.

155
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:58,240
I guess I guess somebody Sam you're so excited you wake up just like a

156
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:01,400
toddler running in the aisles you're just running back and forth to all of your

157
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:06,680
roommates rooms. I knock on the door. Like New Year's Eve like the poppers

161
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:33,180

165
00:07:44,740 --> 00:07:50,580
four times to get me up from a deep sleep and I guess like he would wake me up and

00:07:50,580 --> 00:07:55,420
I look at him and go like hey what's up man and like just immediately go back to

Yik Yak, they brought that back after it was gone for a long time.

211
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:35,080
When that was a big thing, I was in college in North Carolina and I only used it, every

212
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:40,560
single shit that I took on campus I would rate in detail and post it on Yik Yak and I

219
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:20,080
or did they add that later cuz when I tried to I live too close to a school to

00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:38,500
my job in high school is I would film the football games for the coach.

224
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:42,640
Not for the school, but for the coach so he could be like, "Yeah, I want to get like

225
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:44,980
play-by-play analysis of my team."

226
00:12:44,980 --> 00:12:49,460
Get a really, really low angle of the

227
00:12:49,460 --> 00:12:51,900
quarterback from behind.

228
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:54,600
They would put me in like a fucking booth like up top by

234
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:25,760
when we were working like like we had to like film meetings of people and it was

235
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:29,240
always like the most boring it's always like it's only just filming

236
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:32,840
PowerPoints and stuff oh yeah I like so and then you but you get to steal food

237
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:33,840
from them which is awesome.

238
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:37,320
Yeah, get free food and like you get to like miss class or whatever.

239
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:41,960
Like when I was in high school I was like, I would film like assemblies and shit too.

240
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:46,240
So I would just like, I'd be like, oh cool, like I get to miss like most of my classes

241
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:51,240
today but like I have to go to the elementary school to film like the sing-along thing that

242
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:52,240
they're doing.

243
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:57,840
Well ours was, a bunch of the stuff I had to film was people applying for jobs at the school

244
00:13:57,840 --> 00:13:58,840
at Emerson.

245
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:00,400
You'd film them applying?

246
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:04,400
Yeah, so that because they give like presentations or something like and I

247
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:08,100
remember they were all the most horrible annoying people of all. I remember one

248
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:12,800
guy. It's like I need to teach somebody. They like show research they've done and

249
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:17,000
shit and one guy came up and he's like have you guys ever heard of the book

250
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:22,600
Llama Llama Red Pajama? Basically the Migos wrapped this book on a radio show

251
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:28,840
and it's crazy. He showed a video of that in his powerpoint. Damn. Dude, I remember I would just sit

252
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:32,800
there like filming like these classes or this these interviews or some shit I

253
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:37,520
just be like please for the love of God like natural disaster or mass shooting

254
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:42,880
or ceiling collapse right now and I get it on film it'd be so awesome.

255
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:47,720
I'm keeping the tape. Yeah, I would just sit there and imagine any of those three happening being like dude

256
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:51,520
that we'd get like a million hits on Worldstar if I put that up right now.

257
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:57,240
We in high school had to film like the chorus concert. Nice. Like I had to film

258
00:14:57,240 --> 00:15:00,680
like the middle school chorus and there's just like one kid just going fucking

259
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:05,200
nuts yeah yeah singing and dancing every song so I just like like pan around the

260
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:10,240
crowd and just like get the kid in the shot nice it's just like I don't know

261
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:14,220
what they did with the I think they aired it on the public access channel but like

262
00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:19,840
I feel like dude maybe that kid's family was like oh well my son's a star like

263
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:27,120
they'd be honestly pretty dad probably beat him up for being on TV yeah getting

264
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:32,680
some call. Making our family look like fools! Larry, you turned on CLTV recently. Your son's

265
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:38,060
on there. Look, your son's on Leo 21 acting a damn fool! I think that's CG item to be queer

266
00:15:38,060 --> 00:15:45,060
on TV or something like that. I remember when, I don't want to give too many details, but

267
00:15:45,060 --> 00:15:51,600
when a comedy show was being filmed that we were at and me and other person were standing

268
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:55,760
next to the camera and on the tape you could hear us talking about how bad the guy said

269
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:56,760
was.

270
00:15:56,760 --> 00:16:02,720
I'm not going to give any more details of that until after we're done recording.

271
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:04,720
I've never heard that before.

272
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:06,720

326
00:18:39,820 --> 00:18:47,460
kill, kindness kills. As he's eating his soup, there's cyanide in the soup. Right, yeah. Well

327
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:53,700
the soup's really hot, he burns his tongue. Yeah. Burns his tongue and immediately dies.

328
00:18:53,700 --> 00:19:02,220
He realized Louis C.K. He ate soup that was too hot. Yeah. Yeah. Is it, and now that Bill

329
00:19:02,220 --> 00:19:08,600
does Bill Cosby live in New York? Bill Cosby lives in a cube. He lives in a cube that they

330
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:15,600
spin around. If you're Bill Cosby right now, okay? Hello! No. That was a really good impression

331
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:22,600
too. I'm glad. It's funny that that came out like a burp. It was like involuntary. It was

332
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:31,600
like you had to do hello. It was a really accurate hello. Okay so say you're Bill Cosby

333
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:48,800
not you not you are so your bill Cosby no I give up I give up on my hypothetical

334
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:50,800

335
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:52,800

343
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:08,800
they let you out of jail

344
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:10,800
I don't remember why

345
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:12,800
hello it's me Bill Cosby

346
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:14,800

347
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:16,800
and now I sound like this

348
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:19,040
(laughing)

349
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:21,500
- Let me out!

350
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:23,900
They trapped me in a cube!

351
00:20:23,900 --> 00:20:24,740
Oh no!

352
00:20:24,740 --> 00:20:28,280
They put me in the Cosby cube!

353
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:29,600
- That's America's dad that you're

354
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:31,220
having fun of right now, you realize that.

355
00:20:31,220 --> 00:20:32,980
- Get me out of here!

356
00:20:32,980 --> 00:20:37,260
- Okay, what's your idea of that?

357
00:20:37,260 --> 00:20:39,680
Keep going, keep going.

358
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:41,880
- So we're Bill Cosby.

359
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:44,460
- So you two are, so you're the left brain

360
00:20:44,460 --> 00:20:45,300
and you're the right brain.

361
00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:46,340
- We're Bill One and Bill Two.

362
00:20:46,340 --> 00:20:53,220
okay so you walk around in red outfits with our arms interlocked yeah doing what now?

363
00:20:53,220 --> 00:21:03,900
Probably getting his fucking weird eye checked out. Yeah but like what part of America do you go to or

364
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:09,700
anywhere where you just like nobody like shoots you on the street? Yeah. Like how do you how do

365
00:21:09,700 --> 00:21:14,860
do you survive like it's an RPG game it's it's fallout you come you come out of

366
00:21:14,860 --> 00:21:20,460
the vault of prison where are you headed as Bill Cosby where no make it so no I

367
00:21:20,460 --> 00:21:28,980
got bad news okay then what's it I think Boston might be I might go to the

368
00:21:28,980 --> 00:21:33,380
fortress of solitude oh that might be a really good yeah yeah I mean if I was

369
00:21:33,380 --> 00:21:38,140
like you know Bill Cosby I guess he doesn't need to ever be on the street

370
00:21:38,140 --> 00:21:44,460
again is the thing yeah rich yeah if I was Bill Cosby in a dome I would get so

371
00:21:44,460 --> 00:21:50,140
good at working out just get ripped yeah that's I can only do that if I'm Bill

372
00:21:50,140 --> 00:21:58,100
Cosby crap I'll never be able to work out yeah yeah I'm too good of a man yeah

373
00:21:58,100 --> 00:22:06,380
man I mean the hypothetical of like where Bill Cosby would go imagine your

374
00:22:06,380 --> 00:22:13,380
1000 tiny Bill Cosby's. Okay. Okay. Like a nano-box situation. One inch tall each. Yeah.

375
00:22:13,380 --> 00:22:17,420
So now what? That's it. Well it's gonna take you a while to imagine that. That's a lot of

376
00:22:17,420 --> 00:22:23,520
little Bill Cosby's so I'll wait. That's true. I think he is, he is like the one person like

377
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:29,060
that where like I... No one wants to see Bill Cosby perform. And I also just can't. It's

378
00:22:29,060 --> 00:22:34,060
not like, it's not like Louis where it's like, it's still like people would pay to go see

379
00:22:34,060 --> 00:22:38,300
yeah yeah like everyone's just like oh no that's like I think it's maybe like I

380
00:22:38,300 --> 00:22:42,380
remember it wasn't the amount of time until he went to jail he was still he was

381
00:22:42,380 --> 00:22:46,260
doing a tour where he was like until he was like he got arrested he was like

382
00:22:46,260 --> 00:22:51,980
packing out stadiums being like just saying like these women are fucking

383
00:22:51,980 --> 00:22:56,460
liars like that was his old tour it's so crazy the fucking video of him leaving

384
00:22:56,460 --> 00:23:01,980
the courthouse going hey yeah so nuts consummate performer dude he doesn't know

385
00:23:01,980 --> 00:23:07,020
I mean this guy doesn't know he doesn't know where he is right now. He's so old

386
00:23:07,020 --> 00:23:10,460
He has like a fucking agra from Dark Crystal. I

387
00:23:10,460 --> 00:23:17,700
Like yeah, he's old as shit. He probably doesn't like know how to wipe his ass anymore. He's so old

388
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:22,620
Yeah, it could be yeah, or he could be a mastermind

389
00:23:22,620 --> 00:23:27,340
It's true. He could I mean he was always it cause me so say yeah

390
00:23:29,020 --> 00:23:37,020
That's a good point. Yeah. Yeah that that hey could have been completely calculated and played in reverse note. He says yeah, yeah, yeah

391
00:23:37,020 --> 00:23:45,380
It's terrifying and as in yeah, yeah, yeah, I did that. Yep. Yeah. Mm-hmm isn't it is

392
00:23:45,380 --> 00:23:47,420
chilling admittance

393
00:23:47,420 --> 00:23:51,900
Yeah, it middle and missile a bill Cosby's admission admission

394
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:56,140
It may one to the bill Cosby show, but Temple University is Alma mater

395
00:23:56,460 --> 00:23:59,020
I'm not going and his name backwards

396
00:23:59,020 --> 00:24:01,660
Yizbok lib

397
00:24:01,660 --> 00:24:08,820
Wait, I've read about the is buck lip they talk about him in his water chair

398
00:24:08,820 --> 00:24:14,900
Yeah, that's really scary. It was really scary. Yeah, that's the one that when you reverse you

399
00:24:14,900 --> 00:24:17,300
Bill Cosby

400
00:24:17,300 --> 00:24:21,740
If you reverse that that's that black guy TV. Oh my god

401
00:24:21,740 --> 00:24:25,500
He did something really wrong

402
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:26,500
It's scary.

403
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:30,980
So, I mean, crazy that it was Bill Cosby.

404
00:24:30,980 --> 00:24:31,980
Yeah.

405
00:24:31,980 --> 00:24:34,180
Let's stop talking about this.

406
00:24:34,180 --> 00:24:35,940
Yeah, we can stop talking about this.

407
00:24:35,940 --> 00:24:36,940
Jesus Christ.

408
00:24:36,940 --> 00:24:37,940
I watched it.

409
00:24:37,940 --> 00:24:38,940
I finally watched it.

410
00:24:38,940 --> 00:24:42,500
That's a good, like, metric for when to end talking about a topic is when you get to "It's

411
00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:43,500
so crazy."

412
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:44,500
Yeah.

413
00:24:44,500 --> 00:24:46,660
It's like, "Oh, yeah, we're done talking about it."

414
00:24:46,660 --> 00:24:51,620
I finally watched on, like, I had, like, ten people recommend me that show, White Lotus.

415
00:24:51,620 --> 00:24:52,620
Oh, yeah.

416
00:24:52,620 --> 00:24:53,620
In, like, a couple days.

417
00:24:53,620 --> 00:24:54,620
I finally watched it.

418
00:24:54,620 --> 00:24:59,520
I didn't finish it because it's not good but yeah every show like that here's

419
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:04,260
what's awesome about okay it brought back one of my favorite like kinds of

420
00:25:04,260 --> 00:25:09,900
characters in any TV show which is the video game son oh yeah it has one of the

421
00:25:09,900 --> 00:25:14,780
best video game sons of all like a switch with like he's in Hawaii his dad

422
00:25:14,780 --> 00:25:18,340
is like hey look there's like a shark fucking like an octopus outside like

423
00:25:18,340 --> 00:25:21,140
let's go watch that wouldn't that be awesome do you want to go jet skiing do

424
00:25:21,140 --> 00:25:24,100
you want to like have your first drink do you wanna have sex with a prostitute

425
00:25:24,100 --> 00:25:26,980
And he's like, "But dad, I have to save my game!"

426
00:25:26,980 --> 00:25:29,460
It's like so good, dude.

427
00:25:29,460 --> 00:25:32,700
I guess Mike White wrote that all by himself.

428
00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:34,180
That makes perfect sense.

429
00:25:34,180 --> 00:25:37,420
Yeah, it's clearly written by like a very stupid guy.

430
00:25:37,420 --> 00:25:37,920
Yeah.

431
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:38,420
Yeah.

432
00:25:38,420 --> 00:25:40,800
You don't think Mike White is a good writer?

433
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:41,700
He, well, he didn't-

434
00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:42,500
No, I saw the show.

435
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:43,000
It's not good.

436
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:46,820
Think about what he did to Jack Black.

437
00:25:46,820 --> 00:25:47,320
That's true.

438
00:25:47,320 --> 00:25:48,820
He held him down, dude.

439
00:25:48,820 --> 00:25:50,820
He stopped him from starting a band of children.

440
00:25:50,820 --> 00:25:53,900
That's Beckley's Gung by Ned Schneebly, not Mike White.

441
00:25:53,900 --> 00:25:59,700
yeah yeah it is also funny the entire time watching that show to be like like I

442
00:25:59,700 --> 00:26:04,300
can't Ned like he ruined his career by being Ned Schneebly at any point like I'm

443
00:26:04,300 --> 00:26:08,540
gonna take it seriously because it well I mean I've never I haven't seen him in

444
00:26:08,540 --> 00:26:13,140
and it's so funny to to write a movie and then name yourself Ned Schneebly in

445
00:26:13,140 --> 00:26:18,420
the movie yeah wait he wrote I'm pretty sure he did yeah really yeah I'm Ned

446
00:26:18,420 --> 00:26:23,260
Schneebly you know what no I respect that more cuz it's like well okay

447
00:26:23,260 --> 00:26:25,260
I'm the like, wimpy loser.

448
00:26:25,260 --> 00:26:28,860
You can still make yourself the wimpy loser, but don't name yourself Ned Schneebly, because

449
00:26:28,860 --> 00:26:31,700
that's what everyone's going to call you forever.

450
00:26:31,700 --> 00:26:35,540
The reason that he's named Ned Schneebly is so that Jack Black can fucking like, it's

451
00:26:35,540 --> 00:26:39,860
a fucking funny, he hands it off to Jack Black later.

452
00:26:39,860 --> 00:26:43,900
So Jack Black becomes Schneebly to the kids.

453
00:26:43,900 --> 00:26:46,260
So genius, genius move.

454
00:26:46,260 --> 00:26:47,260
Fuck you guys.

455
00:26:47,260 --> 00:26:48,460
That's a good movie and a good move.

456
00:26:48,460 --> 00:26:49,460
It's a great movie.

457
00:26:49,460 --> 00:26:52,220
I love that movie.

458
00:26:52,220 --> 00:26:55,820
I think that he consigned himself to a lifetime of torment.

459
00:26:55,820 --> 00:26:59,520
And also it doesn't really necessarily mean that he's a good writer because he wrote that movie

460
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:03,920
because most of the lines are delivered by either a child or Jack Black.

461
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:08,920
Have you seen the screenplay? It says, "And then Jack Black sings a rock and roll song."

462
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:09,920
Yeah.

463
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:11,920
[imitates rock and roll song]

464
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:14,420
Jack Black hums the 12-bar blues.

465
00:27:14,420 --> 00:27:15,420
Yeah.

466
00:27:15,420 --> 00:27:17,420
[imitates rock and roll song]

467
00:27:17,420 --> 00:27:18,420
That movie rocks so much.

468
00:27:18,420 --> 00:27:19,420
It is an awesome movie.

469
00:27:19,420 --> 00:27:20,420
I love that movie.

470
00:27:20,420 --> 00:27:24,520
more they should have a rock band that's why I got an SG they should have made

471
00:27:24,520 --> 00:27:29,660
like 50 movies about Jack Black having a job yeah like yeah I should have been a

472
00:27:29,660 --> 00:27:34,420
be kind rewound did you guys did I talk to you guys about have you guys seen the

473
00:27:34,420 --> 00:27:39,500
movie year one about him being a cave yeah have you seen the black face that

474
00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:44,180
Bill Hader doesn't that movie no it's really it is crazy nuts it is full body

475
00:27:44,180 --> 00:27:47,660
pitch black with a bone through the nose gonna ask I was gonna ask if there's a

476
00:27:47,660 --> 00:27:52,820
fucking crazy and I've never seen anybody talk about it. I think nose bone is like that's

477
00:27:52,820 --> 00:27:56,980
like that elevates it it almost loops back around where it's like well that's

478
00:27:56,980 --> 00:28:06,860
kinda. And he's named medicine man. That's so fucked. That's from like 2009 I think.

479
00:28:06,860 --> 00:28:14,140
Oh yeah well I mean 2009. This is very funny. Yeah 2009 the Jim Crow era.

480
00:28:14,140 --> 00:28:16,140
They got away with that.

481
00:28:16,140 --> 00:28:19,140
I mean what is that? Year one of Obama.

482
00:28:19,140 --> 00:28:24,140
And they have him, he does his normal like, his normal Bill Hader voice for the character.

483
00:28:24,140 --> 00:28:30,140
But then it's one of those movies where they have like bloopers at the end.

484
00:28:30,140 --> 00:28:33,140
And they show him doing a bunch of different takes with different voices.

485
00:28:33,140 --> 00:28:39,140
And let me tell you, some of those voices, they should not have included in the blooper reel.

486
00:28:39,140 --> 00:28:41,140
I do want to watch it now.

487
00:28:41,140 --> 00:28:45,140
It was just like 15 minutes of him like, "Do I have to wear all the makeup?"

488
00:28:45,140 --> 00:28:47,140
Yeah, this kind of looks bad.

489
00:28:47,140 --> 00:28:49,140
Is this going to age well? I'm not sure.

490
00:28:49,140 --> 00:28:53,140
He's only in it for like two minutes, so you know they were just like, "Oh, we want you to do a cameo."

491
00:28:53,140 --> 00:28:55,140
And he was like, "Okay, fine." And then he got there and they're like, "Okay, put this on."

492
00:28:55,140 --> 00:28:57,140
And he's like, "Oh, God."

493
00:28:57,140 --> 00:28:59,140
"Okay, yes, fine, yes."

494
00:28:59,140 --> 00:29:01,140
Yeah, yeah.

495
00:29:01,140 --> 00:29:03,140
He was probably, what was that, 2009?

496
00:29:03,140 --> 00:29:05,140
He was like lower SNL cast.

497
00:29:05,140 --> 00:29:10,260
Let's see, camel, fallon, and me. This will be great for my career. This is gonna kill.

498
00:29:10,260 --> 00:29:15,380
Yeah, it is just crazy because I've never, I like had never, I assume something that

499
00:29:15,380 --> 00:29:18,020
crazy I would have seen at least one picture or mention of before.

500
00:29:18,020 --> 00:29:19,380
Yeah, of some, you know, person.

501
00:29:19,380 --> 00:29:23,300
Well, that's the thing, he's just built, so beloved that everyone's like,

502
00:29:23,300 --> 00:29:26,820
"Oh, well, let's like, let's not talk about that."

503
00:29:26,820 --> 00:29:30,900
Exactly. It's also not, it's also a bad enough movie that I don't think people are watching it

504
00:29:30,900 --> 00:29:31,900
it to rediscover it.

505
00:29:31,900 --> 00:29:35,660
Yeah, it's like, remember Bill Hader did Blackface in year one?

506
00:29:35,660 --> 00:29:38,380
Yeah, I was like, what are you talking about?

507
00:29:38,380 --> 00:29:42,020
Yeah, it does sound like a movie that you just make up for...

508
00:29:42,020 --> 00:29:43,020
Yeah.

509
00:29:43,020 --> 00:29:44,980
Oh yeah, Jack Black and Michael Cera are cavemen.

510
00:29:44,980 --> 00:29:46,940
They're cavemen and then it's about the Bible.

511
00:29:46,940 --> 00:29:47,940
Yeah.

512
00:29:47,940 --> 00:29:48,940
What?

513
00:29:48,940 --> 00:29:49,940
They're cavemen who live through the Bible.

514
00:29:49,940 --> 00:29:51,660
It's like, there's some funny parts.

515
00:29:51,660 --> 00:29:52,940
I don't think it's horrible.

516
00:29:52,940 --> 00:29:54,380
It's definitely not good.

517
00:29:54,380 --> 00:29:56,820
I like anything with the Bible in it.

518
00:29:56,820 --> 00:29:57,820
You know?

519
00:29:57,820 --> 00:29:58,820
I'm fine with...

520
00:29:58,820 --> 00:30:05,660
David Cross a very funny as Cain the ten. Yeah that about the Bible it is the commandment ten commandments

521
00:30:05,660 --> 00:30:09,980
It's like Michael Showalter, and I have like all the state people no I haven't seen it either

522
00:30:09,980 --> 00:30:13,820
Noah oh

523
00:30:13,820 --> 00:30:16,460
You mean have no mighty no yeah, yeah

524
00:30:16,460 --> 00:30:22,740
You know I was fucked about that movie. They did they did Bruce almighty, which was you know classic Jim Carrey

525
00:30:22,740 --> 00:30:25,140
funny

526
00:30:25,140 --> 00:30:26,500
Funny-ass shit, right?

527
00:30:26,500 --> 00:30:28,000
Classic Jim Crow movie.

528
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:28,500
Yeah.

529
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:29,300
Bruce Almighty.

530
00:30:29,300 --> 00:30:33,940
But then they did Evan Almighty, and Evan Almighty is like, seriously, like, about God.

531
00:30:33,940 --> 00:30:34,440
Yeah.

532
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:37,940
It's like, God rules, all this is real, like, this shit.

533
00:30:37,940 --> 00:30:41,140
Like, in the first one, it's like, I'm God, me so horny.

534
00:30:41,140 --> 00:30:45,840
And then the second one is like, I'm God and like, Christ died for your sins.

535
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:48,940
In real life, you watching the movie, you have to go repent.

536
00:30:48,940 --> 00:30:51,140
It's pretty beast that they just twisted it like that.

537
00:30:51,140 --> 00:30:56,140
- So there's like, I mean, from like the 80s or like the 90s,

538
00:30:56,140 --> 00:31:01,680
like there was like extremely shoehorned Christianity

539
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:03,160
into a shit ton of movies.

540
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:04,000
- Yeah.

541
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:07,280
- Which is like, like you don't think about like growing up

542
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:09,120
like Catholic or Christian or whatever,

543
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:12,200
like you don't think about it, but then like,

544
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:15,620
like movies like Michael or like Bruce Almighty and shit.

545
00:31:15,620 --> 00:31:17,840
- Michael is like about like--

546
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:20,720
- Oh, it's an angel fell from heaven or like the prophecy,

547
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:24,200
movie where it's like oh there's like a war going on in heaven it's like oh well

548
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:28,480
this is the only religion yeah it's the only religion where there would be a war

549
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:32,240
between like gods or angels or whatever or like an angel falling from heaven we

550
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:36,000
should make a movie bird like to counter that we should make a movie about Islam

551
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:44,080
what and I will play Muhammad I remember watching Bruce Almighty as a little kid

552
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:50,280
and getting whatever dude and getting the DVD and like and reading the back

553
00:31:50,280 --> 00:31:54,780
back and it's like you know like Bruce and like Prince these Jim Carrey but like a

554
00:31:54,780 --> 00:31:58,280
visit from God and the prison Morgan Freeman and I was like they made God a

555
00:31:58,280 --> 00:32:06,460
girl and like a very distinct memory of that what's that movie about like

556
00:32:06,460 --> 00:32:12,000
Brendan Fraser yeah yeah with the devil it's not called charmed it's basically

557
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:17,080
maybe it's like a reverse Bruce oh my yeah it's like it's supposed to be like

558
00:32:17,080 --> 00:32:22,160
instead like German Faust is it supposed to be like Faust I actually I don't

559
00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:26,200
remember it all I remember is like seeing that movie it's like Elizabeth

560
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:32,200
Hurley's in it and I remember like being a kid like whoa that's Vanessa it is

561
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:37,240
cool of like there's a lot of there's a lot of men in the 2000s whose biggest

562
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:41,280
fantasy was to fuck the devil yeah you know there was a does a pretty big

563
00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:46,680
motif was like the devil is real but well I mean you girl imagine that the

564
00:32:46,680 --> 00:32:56,160
female devil get up to oh my god she that tail ain't just for show ooh don't

565
00:32:56,160 --> 00:33:01,920
worry about it I want to tail in my ass devil's tail it is it does have that

566
00:33:01,920 --> 00:33:07,240
spike at the end yeah it's I mean that's going in I mean you know maybe it's

567
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:15,360
going in that's going in your butt like an arrow so I mean maybe because it's

568
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:20,280
got like the pointed tip and then it goes down you know what I mean? Would you fuck a

569
00:33:20,280 --> 00:33:26,440
bitch with a tail? Hey I don't know. People are born with tails.

570
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:34,000
There are people who... How big is a tail? Like a six, seven feet? Like a reptile tail? Having a tail like a lion

571
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:37,200
style tail that's just like a tail with a little tuft on the end is like one of

572
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:41,760
the funniest things ever to me I think just the concept of having one of those. We gotta talk about what kind of tail it would be.

573
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:45,120
I mean they don't have the tusks but they have like you know like a three-inch tail

574
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:48,640
Yeah like a vestigial tail. Three inch tail. But it's not like an animal tail.

575
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:52,580
People have three inch tails. If it's a three inch tail no no way I'm gonna be...

576
00:33:52,580 --> 00:33:56,460
Dude it's like it's like that you know that like that that hand hold that you get out of a car.

577
00:33:56,460 --> 00:34:01,700
It's like that. What's it what's it made out of? Person. It's not like metal.

578
00:34:01,700 --> 00:34:06,900
I know like cartilage or like you know. I would assume that I was like the stuff

579
00:34:06,900 --> 00:34:11,640
that yeah cartilage like an ear. Well cuz it could be a bone. I don't know.

580
00:34:11,640 --> 00:34:12,840
I don't think it's a bone.

581
00:34:12,840 --> 00:34:14,840
Well, tails have...

582
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:16,840
The spine goes down the tail, right?

583
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:17,340
Okay, then I'm gonna...

584
00:34:17,340 --> 00:34:18,840
I don't know how far it goes.

585
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:20,840
I mean, it depends on how long the tail is.

586
00:34:20,840 --> 00:34:21,840
I think it does at least a little bit.

587
00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:23,840
I don't really know anything about that.

588
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:24,840
It's gotta be a fucked up tail.

589
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:26,340
Like really long or really short, though.

590
00:34:26,340 --> 00:34:28,340
Like the longest tail in the world.

591
00:34:28,340 --> 00:34:30,340
[laughter]

592
00:34:30,340 --> 00:34:32,340
Yeah, would you fuck a girl with a tail?

593
00:34:32,340 --> 00:34:34,340
Well, only if it was like the longest in the world.

594
00:34:34,340 --> 00:34:35,340
If it was, yeah.

595
00:34:35,340 --> 00:34:37,340
If she was famous for it, yeah.

596
00:34:37,340 --> 00:34:38,340
Yeah, exactly.

597
00:34:38,340 --> 00:34:40,340
If it was a fucking celebrity, sure.

598
00:34:40,340 --> 00:34:42,020
I think that would probably be it.

599
00:34:42,020 --> 00:34:45,740
Do you guys want to hear this Facebook post about a tale that I found?

600
00:34:45,740 --> 00:34:46,740
Yeah.

601
00:34:46,740 --> 00:34:47,980
I am quite sad today.

602
00:34:47,980 --> 00:34:51,620
I was getting off of the bus and my tail ripped off and was left on the bus.

603
00:34:51,620 --> 00:34:54,660
I checked around the stop to see if it fell out the door, but it did not.

604
00:34:54,660 --> 00:34:58,540
It was the tail I blessed and have worn whenever doing a ritual involving nature, the dead,

605
00:34:58,540 --> 00:34:59,540
or animals.

606
00:34:59,540 --> 00:35:02,820
Now I have to get another tail and do another blessing.

607
00:35:02,820 --> 00:35:03,820
When did you find that?

608
00:35:03,820 --> 00:35:04,820
He wrote that the other day.

609
00:35:04,820 --> 00:35:08,500
I found it in a demonology Facebook group.

610
00:35:08,500 --> 00:35:11,780
it's been really I've been thinking about it a lot is I'm quite sad today I was

611
00:35:11,780 --> 00:35:15,940
getting off of the bus and my tail ripped I bet you getting on to the bus and just

612
00:35:15,940 --> 00:35:23,180
seeing like a tail doors closing the next stop it just falls out like Peter

613
00:35:23,180 --> 00:35:26,620
there was a devil on the bus picking up the tail and be like wait a second is

614
00:35:26,620 --> 00:35:32,220

617
00:35:42,380 --> 00:35:47,460
and animals yeah yeah clearly what is demonology it's like the study of demons

618
00:35:47,460 --> 00:35:51,020
and summoning demons and stuff I bet you fucking idiot I didn't know if it was a

619
00:35:51,020 --> 00:35:55,700
very I don't know it's yeah it's a real science yeah I didn't know yeah you know

620
00:35:55,700 --> 00:35:59,340
no I thought it was like no it's where people people like post to be like is

621
00:35:59,340 --> 00:36:04,100
there any demon who who if you call upon them you can get 1 trillion dollars and

622
00:36:04,100 --> 00:36:06,780
then someone will respond and be like yes there is a frog demon who does that

623
00:36:06,780 --> 00:36:11,040
Here's a symbol and then you like print out the symbol and do a really yeah, can we try that?

624
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:16,840
I would love a trillion dollars in the living room. Really? Yeah, if you guys want I can we don't just print a trillion dollars

625
00:36:16,840 --> 00:36:21,300
That's a better idea. Yeah, it cuts out the middleman of a deal

626
00:36:21,300 --> 00:36:27,140
Yeah, it's true. It's not a bad idea. Would you fuck I'm not

627
00:36:27,140 --> 00:36:34,020
Would you fuck scenarios? Would you not fuck would you marry a conjoined twin?

628
00:36:34,020 --> 00:36:42,860
This is actually a really great question by Caleb. Good work. I mean, because I'd

629
00:36:42,860 --> 00:36:48,780
have to love both of them. Oh here's the other thing. One of them you hate and one

630
00:36:48,780 --> 00:36:54,020
of them, and one of them's your wife's sister. I mean come on.

631
00:36:54,020 --> 00:37:01,940
Too easy. I mean I would have to like, I would have to like, you know, wouldn't

632
00:37:01,940 --> 00:37:07,940
have to be like... You tell me it would need to be a the same damn time

633
00:37:07,940 --> 00:37:11,460
situation. Yeah I'd have to be in love with both of them I think because if I'm

634
00:37:11,460 --> 00:37:15,700
like if I find one of them very like their personality very grating it would

635
00:37:15,700 --> 00:37:21,460
be so hard are you kidding me they're there all the time. Yeah. But if the if

636
00:37:21,460 --> 00:37:27,580
they're both like you know like hey you know I really love your sister. Yeah. I'm

637
00:37:27,580 --> 00:37:33,620
saying it to them like in the bathroom I would like to get married to you.

638
00:37:33,620 --> 00:37:38,140
Yeah okay you know so you'd do you'd be you invest in the the side cart for the

639
00:37:38,140 --> 00:37:42,260
car so you all sit in the front seat uh-huh and you'd get the three person bed.

640
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:46,740
I mean if I really did love them I would yeah yeah but goddamn could you

641
00:37:46,740 --> 00:37:50,980
imagine how fucking horrible it would be if like your conjoined twins like sister

642
00:37:50,980 --> 00:37:54,540
is just annoying as shit yeah like she's like a fucking like she's like I want to

643
00:37:54,540 --> 00:37:57,660
go to Disney. It's like, well, you know, I can't like fucking be like, okay, like,

644
00:37:57,660 --> 00:37:59,100
you know, you go to Disney, you know,

645
00:37:59,100 --> 00:38:03,900
or joined at like a really inconvenient place on their body. Yeah. Yeah.

646
00:38:03,900 --> 00:38:07,100
It'd be pretty bad. That's what I was thinking. Like the two heads. Yeah.

647
00:38:07,100 --> 00:38:11,060
The two heads or their butt. Yeah. Or their damn butt. Yeah.

648
00:38:11,060 --> 00:38:14,620
But if they're like conjoined right at the hip and it's like clear that they

649
00:38:14,620 --> 00:38:19,180
could have at any point got surgery to, to unconjoined, but then they didn't.

650
00:38:19,180 --> 00:38:22,500
Like a stuck on you situation. Yeah.

651
00:38:22,540 --> 00:38:25,980
You know what's fucked up is when twins marry other twins.

652
00:38:25,980 --> 00:38:27,580
Oh, I hate that.

653
00:38:27,580 --> 00:38:28,380
And then they--

654
00:38:28,380 --> 00:38:29,260
Yeah.

655
00:38:29,260 --> 00:38:29,820
I hate that.

656
00:38:29,820 --> 00:38:31,220
I hate watching videos like that.

657
00:38:31,220 --> 00:38:32,940
Dude, I like-- fucking twins--

658
00:38:32,940 --> 00:38:34,700
I hate twins.

659
00:38:34,700 --> 00:38:37,660
Twins like that freak me out, because then it's like--

660
00:38:37,660 --> 00:38:41,940
like if you're marrying your--

661
00:38:41,940 --> 00:38:44,020
like if you're a set of twins and you're

662
00:38:44,020 --> 00:38:45,780
marrying another set of twins, that

663
00:38:45,780 --> 00:38:49,740
means you like being a twin that much.

664
00:38:49,740 --> 00:38:50,740
And that's weird.

665
00:38:50,740 --> 00:38:52,260
But if it's like twins and it's like--

666
00:38:52,260 --> 00:38:55,140
what feels like you're completely different. Oh yeah, imagine if like if you're like it's

667
00:38:55,140 --> 00:38:58,340
like you and your brother and your sister and you're like we have to find another

668
00:38:58,340 --> 00:39:03,260
three children to marry. Like another like another group of another group of

669
00:39:03,260 --> 00:39:08,260
brothers and sisters that are mapped one-to-one exactly to us. Like exactly

670
00:39:08,260 --> 00:39:12,740
identical twins marrying exactly identical twins? Yeah it's fucked up it

671
00:39:12,740 --> 00:39:15,700
shouldn't happen. I mean what happens what happens when you're in the dark?

672
00:39:15,700 --> 00:39:20,740
They should just take one of the twins away. I don't think I've

673
00:39:20,740 --> 00:39:25,780
ever known an identical twin I knew I knew some identical twins and I'm trying to

674
00:39:25,780 --> 00:39:29,940
think did they do you know them as an adult Mitchell and Michael that's just a

675
00:39:29,940 --> 00:39:34,060
recipe for disaster name them the most opposite give one of them a girl name

676
00:39:34,060 --> 00:39:39,300
who cares just like make them as opposite as you can I knew them in

677
00:39:39,300 --> 00:39:43,700
fifth grade they moved the last thing I want is like two kids showing up to

678
00:39:43,700 --> 00:39:50,020
school dress the same that and they have my last name they both had Mohawks

679
00:39:50,020 --> 00:39:50,860
- Here's what I do.

680
00:39:50,860 --> 00:39:51,680
- That's sick.

681
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:53,940
- I do, whichever one wants a mohawk, give him the mohawk.

682
00:39:53,940 --> 00:39:55,820
The other kid, don't care what he wants,

683
00:39:55,820 --> 00:39:58,100
shave a giant line in the middle of his head.

684
00:39:58,100 --> 00:39:58,940
- Reverse mohawk.

685
00:39:58,940 --> 00:40:00,980
- Everything has to be completely reversed.

686
00:40:00,980 --> 00:40:02,020
- Yeah. - Yeah.

687
00:40:02,020 --> 00:40:03,280
- I mean, if I had twins,

688
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:04,920
I would not dress them up the same at all.

689
00:40:04,920 --> 00:40:05,860
Are you kidding me?

690
00:40:05,860 --> 00:40:06,700
- No.

691
00:40:06,700 --> 00:40:08,180
- I'm trying to goatee on one of them

692
00:40:08,180 --> 00:40:09,020
as soon as they're born.

693
00:40:09,020 --> 00:40:09,860
- I'm like, I know which one's which.

694
00:40:09,860 --> 00:40:11,860
- I would put one up for adoption,

695
00:40:11,860 --> 00:40:13,060
whichever one crawls slower.

696
00:40:13,060 --> 00:40:14,260
- That's actually smart.

697
00:40:14,260 --> 00:40:15,100
- Yeah.

698
00:40:15,100 --> 00:40:15,920
- No, that's horrible.

699
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:16,760
- Why? - What's bad about that?

700
00:40:16,760 --> 00:40:21,640
you don't have then then when they grow up they can have like a cool reunion yeah

701
00:40:21,640 --> 00:40:25,760
like for them like a cool it's an excuse to have a party three I mean you've not

702
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:28,480
seen three identical strangers you know what happens that one of them kills

703
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:35,640
himself yeah because of something else it's not the twin shit and also one for

704
00:40:35,640 --> 00:40:41,480
three is like also that's so funny that like back in the 70s like those dudes

705
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:45,880
were like just cuz it was like the story was so crazy and there are three

706
00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:50,360
identical guys that like back then that's all you needed to do to get into like

707
00:40:50,360 --> 00:40:54,960
Studio 54 it's just like holy shit these three guys look the same yeah bring them

708
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:58,640
in here they can party with David Bowie also my favorite part of that movie is

709
00:40:58,640 --> 00:41:03,160
when they talk about like they talk about like like both of them like they

710
00:41:03,160 --> 00:41:06,200
don't really know where they're like you know orphans and really know where they

711
00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:10,200
came from and then they meet the first two brothers like meet at like a

712
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:13,400
community college or something and they meet each other and they're like whoa

713
00:41:13,400 --> 00:41:17,680
This is so weird that guy looks a lot like me. Oh, that's really weird

714
00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:21,160
It's so weird that this guy looks exactly like me and they hung out for like weeks

715
00:41:21,160 --> 00:41:27,740
And then they were like wait we might actually be brother. Yeah, this is a guy mirroring every single move you do

716
00:41:27,740 --> 00:41:29,740
Yeah, like this is

717
00:41:29,740 --> 00:41:35,680
The coolest we twinning today, you know what now that I'm thinking about it. Maybe put the fucking other kid

718
00:41:35,680 --> 00:41:42,740
Go for four identical. Yeah, yeah, if you have quadruplets, oh, yeah, I'm sending them to the four corn

719
00:41:42,740 --> 00:41:45,460
I'm sitting to the four corners of the world. I'm also putting a different

720
00:41:45,460 --> 00:41:48,900
colored stone in their pocket that represents an element. Hopefully they

721
00:41:48,900 --> 00:41:52,040
come back with like a water power and then they join in the middle they

722
00:41:52,040 --> 00:41:59,060
summon me back after I'm dead. Yeah. And maybe we rob banks or something.

723
00:41:59,060 --> 00:42:03,420
Just to bring it back to demonology for a second I was looking up demons that

724
00:42:03,420 --> 00:42:08,660
give you wealth and the demon who gives wealth, who can bestow great wealth is

725
00:42:08,660 --> 00:42:13,780
is named Klonic also named Klont and this is what it says on Wikipedia about

726
00:42:13,780 --> 00:42:20,220
Klonic. Klonic is first or numero uno in the ordering of the 18 spirits.

727
00:42:20,220 --> 00:42:28,620
Oh numero uno. Is that where numero uno comes from? Yeah I think so. Oh wait that's Spanish.

728
00:42:28,620 --> 00:42:34,020
Oops. No it's demonology. That's really all that I'd want to share it's just that

729
00:42:34,020 --> 00:42:36,020
It says he's numero uno.

730
00:42:36,020 --> 00:42:38,020
I thought that was Klont.

731
00:42:38,020 --> 00:42:40,020
Klont is numero uno.

732
00:42:40,020 --> 00:42:42,020
I really needed a...

733
00:42:42,020 --> 00:42:44,020
What?

734
00:42:44,020 --> 00:42:46,020
I got a shipping notification.

735
00:42:46,020 --> 00:42:48,020
My shirt came here.

736
00:42:48,020 --> 00:42:50,020
You got a shitting notification.

737
00:42:50,020 --> 00:42:52,020

Don't do that.

741
00:42:58,020 --> 00:43:00,020
If you do it on that chair,

742
00:43:00,020 --> 00:43:02,020
it's going to go through and make it look like

743
00:43:02,020 --> 00:43:08,540
Yeah, yeah, it's gonna look like silly putty. Yeah, really sweet actually you ever seen if you ever left like silly putty in your mom's car

744
00:43:08,540 --> 00:43:10,980
And like gone and touched it the next day, and it's just goo

745
00:43:10,980 --> 00:43:13,940
Isn't it always goo?

00:43:13,940 --> 00:43:21,980
And you smile like I was gonna be like oh, yeah, no no you know like you'd like melted silly putty

747
00:43:21,980 --> 00:43:27,700
You ever like thrown silly putty against the wall and it cracks open and there's some kind of sticky stuff inside

748
00:43:27,700 --> 00:43:31,980
It's the weirdest thing have you ever if you ever left an ice cream cone outside on a hot day you leave for an

749
00:43:31,980 --> 00:43:38,540
hour you come back it's like gone. It's like the weirdest it must be quantum

putting a scalpel in your own mouth.

756
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:03,960

757
00:44:03,960 --> 00:44:05,200
- Yeah, yeah.

758
00:44:05,200 --> 00:44:07,120

781
00:45:18,200 --> 00:45:22,960
comedy show that's called like Best Medicine it's like oh fuck you that is

782
00:45:22,960 --> 00:45:29,680

784
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:43,560
the best name Legion of Skanks exactly no you have to name it like like it needs

785
00:45:43,560 --> 00:45:47,880
to have a disgusting name I think. Yeah. Right? Yeah. Or just something stupid. Not

like, not like, look, because Best Medicine is like 40 year old like

787
00:45:52,160 --> 00:45:57,040

00:45:57,040 --> 00:46:01,400
with a good name. Yeah, they're never good. Like literally never in my life. Or just name it,

825
00:48:05,300 --> 00:48:12,260
the video deserves to be preserved I mean I want to find the original because the

826
00:48:12,260 --> 00:48:15,820
thing about that video is it got passed around so much that it was screen

827
00:48:15,820 --> 00:48:19,940
recorded so many times yeah you can make out that there's a big balls and little

828
00:48:19,940 --> 00:48:24,660
dick but maybe we need a restoration team yeah yeah we need Peter Jackson and

829
00:48:24,660 --> 00:48:28,180
like a team of people to go through and there needs to be a full documentary

830
00:48:28,180 --> 00:48:29,780
about them restoring the video.

831
00:48:29,780 --> 00:48:30,620
- Yeah, about, yeah.

832
00:48:30,620 --> 00:48:31,440
- Yeah.

833
00:48:31,440 --> 00:48:33,620
- Them restoring, look at his butt.

834
00:48:33,620 --> 00:48:34,460
- Let me see your butt.

835
00:48:34,460 --> 00:48:35,280
- Let me see your butt.

836
00:48:35,280 --> 00:48:36,120
- He naked.

837
00:48:36,120 --> 00:48:36,960
- He naked.

838
00:48:36,960 --> 00:48:37,780
- Oh man.

839
00:48:37,780 --> 00:48:39,480
- Yeah, and Peter Jackson will just be like

840
00:48:39,480 --> 00:48:42,260
sitting there with some dial just like perfectly.

841
00:48:42,260 --> 00:48:43,100
- Yeah.

842
00:48:43,100 --> 00:48:44,560
- We could do AI upscaling on it.

843
00:48:44,560 --> 00:48:45,400
- Boost the color up.

844
00:48:45,400 --> 00:48:46,220
- We should.

845
00:48:46,220 --> 00:48:47,060
- Boost the color up.

846
00:48:47,060 --> 00:48:47,900
- We should.

847
00:48:47,900 --> 00:48:48,720
(laughing)

848
00:48:48,720 --> 00:48:49,560
- I think, yeah, we will do that.

849
00:48:49,560 --> 00:48:50,400
- Boost the balls up.

850
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:51,520
Make the balls larger.

851
00:48:51,520 --> 00:48:52,360
- The balls.

852
00:48:52,360 --> 00:48:54,440
- If you raise the contrast.

853
00:48:54,440 --> 00:48:57,280
- We're trying to be as close as to the original material

854
00:48:57,280 --> 00:48:58,120
as possible.

855
00:48:58,120 --> 00:49:00,260
the contrast up you're gonna you're gonna you're gonna lose

856
00:49:00,260 --> 00:49:05,200
all the shadow and a little bit not a microscopic dick a little

857
00:49:05,200 --> 00:49:07,920
bit comes out in a bunch of like like film reviews are really

858
00:49:07,920 --> 00:49:11,320
pissed off and they're like they it completely ruined there's

859
00:49:11,320 --> 00:49:14,520
there's this weird green tone now and they totally overdid it

860
00:49:14,520 --> 00:49:18,320
they CGI remastered the balls to make them bigger and bouncier

861
00:49:18,320 --> 00:49:25,820
video that's like clearly made in like blender. I got gray box

862
00:49:25,820 --> 00:49:33,260
the audio yeah Oh he naked big balls little dick let me see your butt and

863
00:49:33,260 --> 00:49:37,140
then just like a bouncing like a buzzing like liquid simulation of the ball gonna

864
00:49:37,140 --> 00:49:41,260
be I like the thing that's gonna piss me off the most about it though is once

865
00:49:41,260 --> 00:49:47,360
they once fucking Universal Studios remakes it big balls little dick the

866
00:49:47,360 --> 00:49:52,780
right yeah big balls little dick the ride and there's an you just go it's just

867
00:49:52,780 --> 00:49:54,600
- There's a roller coaster that just goes slowly

868
00:49:54,600 --> 00:49:56,480
and there's just an animatronic next to you

869
00:49:56,480 --> 00:49:59,800
and it's running with his legs, his dick out.

870
00:49:59,800 --> 00:50:02,280
And they're just like, over like a tinny speaker,

871
00:50:02,280 --> 00:50:06,280
it's just like, "You're naked, big balls, where's death?"

872
00:50:06,280 --> 00:50:07,880
- They, dude, they honestly--

873
00:50:07,880 --> 00:50:09,920
- Like a 4D experience. - And then it does,

874
00:50:09,920 --> 00:50:10,760
and then it does-- - That's a good idea.

875
00:50:10,760 --> 00:50:13,480
- And then it does a hundred loop-de-loops at the end.

876
00:50:13,480 --> 00:50:14,840
- Yeah, to get you really dizzy.

877
00:50:14,840 --> 00:50:15,680
- Yeah.

878
00:50:15,680 --> 00:50:17,000
- So you come off the ride, you're like, "Ugh."

879
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:18,040
- Oh, I was thinking, I was thinking like,

880
00:50:18,040 --> 00:50:19,720
one of Universal's like, 4D rides,

881
00:50:19,720 --> 00:50:21,560
like the fucking like, race through New York.

882
00:50:21,560 --> 00:50:24,280
So it's like you see the big ball, you're trying to chase the big ball.

883
00:50:24,280 --> 00:50:27,640
Oh yeah, it's like swerving through, it goes like between the balls and the dick.

884
00:50:27,640 --> 00:50:31,400
Yeah. Oh, he gets hit by the biggening ray.

885
00:50:31,400 --> 00:50:34,720
Oh yeah, they have to build a story around it.

886
00:50:34,720 --> 00:50:39,120
Yeah, and then the big balls, little dick, so he's trying to, so it starts out,

887
00:50:39,120 --> 00:50:42,520
he's trying to, he's in the lab,

888
00:50:42,520 --> 00:50:46,040
and he's trying to make his dick bigger. He's a scientist.

889
00:50:46,040 --> 00:50:49,320
He's trying to make his dick bigger with the ray.

890
00:50:49,320 --> 00:50:51,200
- Yeah, the beginning ray.

891
00:50:51,200 --> 00:50:52,440
- The beginning ray.

892
00:50:52,440 --> 00:50:55,480
So it misses by, I mean, his calculations are off.

893
00:50:55,480 --> 00:50:56,320
- One nanometer.

894
00:50:56,320 --> 00:50:59,760
- Yeah, it was one nanometer off and it hit the balls

895
00:50:59,760 --> 00:51:01,640
and that's why the balls are big.

896
00:51:01,640 --> 00:51:02,460
- Yeah.

897
00:51:02,460 --> 00:51:07,040
- So he gets so mad, he drips off his, I mean, you know.

898
00:51:07,040 --> 00:51:07,880
- He hulks out.

899
00:51:07,880 --> 00:51:09,400
- He's already naked, he's hulking out.

900
00:51:09,400 --> 00:51:10,240
- Yeah.

901
00:51:10,240 --> 00:51:12,400
- So then, you know, you're going through the city

902
00:51:12,400 --> 00:51:14,880
and you get like a call, it's like Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson

903
00:51:14,880 --> 00:51:16,680
and Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson's like calling you

904
00:51:16,680 --> 00:51:21,640
he's like like oh we need your we need your help we need you and a crew to get

905
00:51:21,640 --> 00:51:25,400
into New York City and I need you to chase down the big balls little dick

906
00:51:25,400 --> 00:51:28,280
man you have you have those like you know those water guns where you're

907
00:51:28,280 --> 00:51:32,640
trying to be great is going off the chain it's going crazy where you have to

908
00:51:32,640 --> 00:51:36,600
like shoot the thing to do the race like I like it like at an amusement park

909
00:51:36,600 --> 00:51:39,200
there's one of those booths yeah the water gun you have one of those and you

910
00:51:39,200 --> 00:51:43,000
have to shoot it into the dick hole inflate the dick to be the same size as

911
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:47,520
the balls. So it's also like the MIB ride at Universal. I haven't been to Universal.

912
00:51:47,520 --> 00:51:55,440
Okay. So you're Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson.

913
00:51:55,440 --> 00:52:02,440
[Music]

914
00:52:02,440 --> 00:52:08,160
So Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson, you and the other riders are a part of a team.

915
00:52:08,160 --> 00:52:12,600
Yeah. Well that's and all the briefing is in the line. It's like what you see

916
00:52:12,600 --> 00:52:16,960
in the line where it's a looping video and he's like listen agent we get a we his

917
00:52:16,960 --> 00:52:22,840
balls are it's like a blob and balls are gonna take over the city we have to

918
00:52:22,840 --> 00:52:25,840
balance it out by making his dick large as well there's also there's

919
00:52:25,840 --> 00:52:30,320
velociraptor yeah and then the stormtroopers walk yeah yeah it's

920
00:52:30,320 --> 00:52:35,080
exactly like that new Star Wars right taking a wrong turn when you're walking

921
00:52:35,080 --> 00:52:37,440
through the new like Star Wars experience and walking into like an

922
00:52:37,440 --> 00:52:41,480
unfinished room and you see them building like a big

923
00:52:41,480 --> 00:52:45,320
else is so high quality and then it's like a Chuck E. Cheese animatronic with a big balls

924
00:52:45,320 --> 00:52:46,320
little dick man.

925
00:52:46,320 --> 00:52:47,320
You're like, "What is this?"

926
00:52:47,320 --> 00:52:48,560
And they're like, "Oh, we're still working on it.

927
00:52:48,560 --> 00:52:49,560
Get out of here."

928
00:52:49,560 --> 00:52:50,560
"Get out!

929
00:52:50,560 --> 00:52:51,560
You're not supposed to be in here!"

930
00:52:51,560 --> 00:52:58,200
There's a guy with like all the, what are those called, the fucking electrodes on his

931
00:52:58,200 --> 00:53:02,120
head sitting there and they're just feeding him lines with a big balls little dick as

932
00:53:02,120 --> 00:53:03,120
he watches.

933
00:53:03,120 --> 00:53:05,720
Star Wars Episode 10.

934
00:53:05,720 --> 00:53:06,720
Let me see your butt.

935
00:53:06,720 --> 00:53:08,160
Let me see your butt.

936
00:53:08,160 --> 00:53:11,280
that's actually not a bad idea because like I see these videos a lot and I'm

937
00:53:11,280 --> 00:53:15,320
like I wish I was there I wish I could experience this oh I wish I saw the big

938
00:53:15,320 --> 00:53:19,440
balls little dick there's so many yeah like I wish I would have done anything I

939
00:53:19,440 --> 00:53:23,880
walk around in my life waiting for to be in one of those videos so I would do

940
00:53:23,880 --> 00:53:29,400
anything to have like the 40 created in an amusement park yeah it's a really

941
00:53:29,400 --> 00:53:36,560
good idea with the right so would that ride end with you getting the video look

942
00:53:36,560 --> 00:53:40,360
at him big balls yeah with that would it's like Pokemon snap at the end yeah

943
00:53:40,360 --> 00:53:44,120
okay yeah and then and then there's like a booth where you can buy the video of

944
00:53:44,120 --> 00:53:49,280
yourself standing next to him uh-huh taking the video of him yeah I mean

945
00:53:49,280 --> 00:53:53,880
there's so many good ones dude like yeah imagine they recreated the like that the

946
00:53:53,880 --> 00:53:58,280
at the end of the mummy ride when like I still don't know the rides the rap

947
00:53:58,280 --> 00:54:02,440
battle video of those two kids in school where the guy says you smoke fagues

948
00:54:02,440 --> 00:54:08,240
remember that one no or like the mind if I while out video yeah that would be so

949
00:54:08,240 --> 00:54:13,440
many ones oh you can't do this on concrete yeah yeah that'd be a great one

950
00:54:13,440 --> 00:54:16,760
yeah and they could I mean and I would want them all to get their individual

951
00:54:16,760 --> 00:54:24,760
right your mission it's it's Black Friday you need to get all the you need

952

953
00:54:28,560 --> 00:54:33,640
on concrete guys like he's like the final boss yeah yeah it's not a bad arcade

954
00:54:33,640 --> 00:54:40,920
game than a ride mmm no I think no it has to be a ride what other video it was

955

mustard you just have to shoot mustard

957
00:54:52,120 --> 00:55:02,120
he starts chasing you and you have to take a face of action

958
00:55:02,120 --> 00:55:05,120
the car moves back in the ride

959
00:55:05,120 --> 00:55:08,120
he's going like with like mustard

960
00:55:08,120 --> 00:55:11,120
yeah damn

961
00:55:11,120 --> 00:55:14,920

00:55:14,920 --> 00:55:19,920
than fucking, what is that one, Escape from Gringotts?

963

'cause it would still be hot enough that we could go on the- the...

993
00:56:27,780 --> 00:56:28,680
Boston Tea Party.

994
00:56:28,680 --> 00:56:29,180
Yeah.

995
00:56:29,180 --> 00:56:30,480
Dude, the Yankee Cannonball.

996
00:56:30,480 --> 00:56:31,680
You gotta check out the Yankee Cannonball.

997
00:56:31,680 --> 00:56:32,380
It's fuckin' sick.

998
00:56:32,380 --> 00:56:32,880
What that is.

999
00:56:32,880 --> 00:56:34,580
It's a really old wooden roller coaster.

1000
00:56:34,580 --> 00:56:35,980
Oh, I love hurting my back.

1001
00:56:35,980 --> 00:56:36,480
Yeah.

1002
00:56:36,480 --> 00:56:37,180
It's sick.

1003
00:56:37,180 --> 00:56:39,980
Dude, Yankee Cannonball, um...

1004
00:56:39,980 --> 00:56:41,180
Ultimate Frisbee, I think?

1005
00:56:41,180 --> 00:56:44,220
The Ultimate Frisbee, yeah, that one I wrote that one so many times.

1006
00:56:44,220 --> 00:56:45,220
It's the worst name ever.

1007
00:56:45,220 --> 00:56:46,220
They have a fun log flume.

1008
00:56:46,220 --> 00:56:48,740
Oh, it's the whole park is New England themed.

1009
00:56:48,740 --> 00:56:49,740
Oh, okay.

1010
00:56:49,740 --> 00:56:51,300
So Ultimate Frisbee is like one of...

1011
00:56:51,300 --> 00:56:53,060
It's not, no, just some of them are.

1012
00:56:53,060 --> 00:56:54,060
Some of the older ones are New England themed.

1013
00:56:54,060 --> 00:56:55,060
You play Ultimate Frisbee with white people, shit.

1014
00:56:55,060 --> 00:56:56,580
White people play Frisbee in Harvard Yard.

1015
00:56:56,580 --> 00:56:57,580
I guess that's true, yeah.

1016
00:56:57,580 --> 00:56:58,580
Harvard Yard.

1017
00:56:58,580 --> 00:56:59,580
They have a skateboard ride too.

1018
00:56:59,580 --> 00:57:00,580
Really?

1019
00:57:00,580 --> 00:57:02,580
That's like a baby version of the Ultimate Frisbee.

1020
00:57:02,580 --> 00:57:03,580
Yeah, I like that one.

1021
00:57:03,580 --> 00:57:04,580
They have Da Vinci's Dream.

1022
00:57:04,580 --> 00:57:06,580
Da Vinci's Dream, oh, fuck.

1023
00:57:06,580 --> 00:57:07,580
Yeah, what else do they have?

1024
00:57:07,580 --> 00:57:08,580
The Caterpillar, they have.

1025
00:57:08,580 --> 00:57:09,960
I think I've heard of Da Vinci's Dream.

1026
00:57:09,960 --> 00:57:12,460
Yeah, it's like a big like, you swings and it goes like...

1027
00:57:12,460 --> 00:57:14,960
It was to cut open a pregnant woman.

1028
00:57:14,960 --> 00:57:16,960
[Laughter]

1029
00:57:16,960 --> 00:57:21,620
I think Da Vinci's Dream is just like a, that's just like a carnival ride.

1030
00:57:21,620 --> 00:57:22,120
Yeah.

1031
00:57:22,120 --> 00:57:24,360
Yeah, only a few of them are New England themed.

1032
00:57:24,360 --> 00:57:25,860
This one's huge.

1033
00:57:25,860 --> 00:57:26,860
Humongous, you said.

1034
00:57:26,860 --> 00:57:28,520
This one's way bigger than the one at the carnival.

1035
00:57:28,520 --> 00:57:30,020
Those are the scariest rides.

1036
00:57:30,020 --> 00:57:31,020
Those will give you more...

1037
00:57:31,020 --> 00:57:32,020
Yeah, 'cause it's teenagers operated.

1038
00:57:32,020 --> 00:57:34,920
Those will give you more of a thrill than any like,

1039
00:57:34,920 --> 00:57:38,840
thing called like x-squared maximum fuck you.

1040
00:57:38,840 --> 00:57:42,360
Speaking of untamed. Yeah untamed. Is that a good one?

1041
00:57:42,360 --> 00:57:46,040
I've written untamed. Oh dude, untamed fucking rules.

1042
00:57:46,040 --> 00:57:49,800
Yeah. God, we've planned a canopy trip on the show

1043
00:57:49,800 --> 00:57:54,680
three times now. Probably. We've never done it dude. You have to do it. You guys are promise breakers.

1044
00:57:54,680 --> 00:57:58,120
We have to do it. I think if we just keep saying it. Look me in the eyes and tell

1045
00:57:58,120 --> 00:58:01,240
me you promised me you'll take me to Canobie Lake Park. I promise that I'll take you to

1046
00:58:01,240 --> 00:58:03,800
Canobie Lake Park. You have to just drive us to Canobie Lake Park.

1047
00:58:03,800 --> 00:58:04,640
- No!

1048
00:58:04,640 --> 00:58:05,480
- You have to.

1049
00:58:05,480 --> 00:58:07,480
- You would have to drive us, that's the thing.

1050
00:58:07,480 --> 00:58:08,440
- When?

1051
00:58:08,440 --> 00:58:09,360
- Tomorrow.

1052
00:58:09,360 --> 00:58:10,760
- I'll go tomorrow, sure.

1053
00:58:10,760 --> 00:58:11,600
- Really?

1054
00:58:11,600 --> 00:58:12,420
- Yeah.

1055
00:58:12,420 --> 00:58:13,260
How much are tickets?

1056
00:58:13,260 --> 00:58:14,080
- No, not tomorrow.

1057
00:58:14,080 --> 00:58:14,920
- Not even that much.

1058
00:58:14,920 --> 00:58:16,480
- We have to wait 'til it cools down some.

1059
00:58:16,480 --> 00:58:17,320
- Yeah.

1060
00:58:17,320 --> 00:58:18,160
- And then we're gonna go, we'll plan a trip.

1061
00:58:18,160 --> 00:58:18,980
- Oh my God.

1062
00:58:18,980 --> 00:58:19,920
All right, we'll plan it tomorrow.

1063
00:58:19,920 --> 00:58:21,620
- We'll stay with Patrick's family.

1064
00:58:21,620 --> 00:58:22,460
- Yeah.

1065
00:58:22,460 --> 00:58:23,280
- Oh, maybe.

1066
00:58:23,280 --> 00:58:24,120
- Yeah!

1067
00:58:24,120 --> 00:58:24,960
- We'll stay with all of Patrick's family.

1068
00:58:24,960 --> 00:58:26,560
- Maybe we get like an Airbnb or something.

1069
00:58:26,560 --> 00:58:29,280
- I think we'll stay with Patrick's family.

1070
00:58:29,280 --> 00:58:30,520
- Why?

1071
00:58:30,520 --> 00:58:33,640
- My parents would fucking love to keep you guys.

1072
00:58:33,640 --> 00:58:35,880
Okay, me and Caleb stay with Patrick's family.

1073
00:58:35,880 --> 00:58:36,880
And I stay at a hotel.

1074
00:58:36,880 --> 00:58:37,880
Patrick gets an Airbnb.

1075
00:58:37,880 --> 00:58:38,880
Patrick has to go back to New York.

1076
00:58:38,880 --> 00:58:39,880
Yeah.

1077
00:58:39,880 --> 00:58:41,240
Me and Cam go to Canobie Lake Park.

1078
00:58:41,240 --> 00:58:42,240
You know what?

1079
00:58:42,240 --> 00:58:43,240
You know what?

1080
00:58:43,240 --> 00:58:44,240
Now that you've mentioned my parents-

1081
00:58:44,240 --> 00:58:45,240
And we show up at your door-

1082
00:58:45,240 --> 00:58:46,240
They're gonna fucking text me about this now.

1083
00:58:46,240 --> 00:58:48,280
We show up at your parents' door with an urn.

1084
00:58:48,280 --> 00:58:49,280
Good.

1085
00:58:49,280 --> 00:58:50,280
You know what?

1086
00:58:50,280 --> 00:58:51,280
We need this to happen.

1087
00:58:51,280 --> 00:58:54,040
We show up at your parents' door with an urn that's labeled Patrick.

1088
00:58:54,040 --> 00:58:57,760
We just start crying as soon as I open the door.

1089
00:58:57,760 --> 00:58:58,760
The other day we were-

1090
00:58:58,760 --> 00:59:00,400
I forget what we were looking at it for.

1091
00:59:00,400 --> 00:59:06,000
were looking at we found these like these like custom urns on on on on etsy and

1092
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:10,360
and there was one that was a sponge most of them were like designed like they're

1093
00:59:10,360 --> 00:59:13,280
like pretty well made like there's one that looked like a bowling pin but a

1094
00:59:13,280 --> 00:59:16,880
sponge from one is just an urn that just has a picture of sponge it was fun and

1095
00:59:16,880 --> 00:59:21,640
dude it's so depressed yeah but that I was a child urn yeah well but just like

1096
00:59:21,640 --> 00:59:24,440
imagining like looking down from heaven and seeing that like your shitty

1097
00:59:24,440 --> 00:59:30,440
city daughter is ordering an urn for you off of etsy but like but after we

1098
00:59:30,440 --> 00:59:34,080
looked at that we're laughing about it. I like I was I just started getting

1099
00:59:34,080 --> 00:59:38,800
ads for the like the sponge bob urn like not for urns but for specifically that

1100
00:59:38,800 --> 00:59:45,400
urn showed up twice like side hunting urn to it is yeah, it's like a child's

1101
00:59:45,400 --> 00:59:52,440
urn yeah, how pissed would you be if you were fifteen and you and then you

1102
00:59:52,440 --> 00:59:56,840
similarly look down on your mom buying a pink Spongebob earn for you.

1103
00:59:56,840 --> 00:59:59,840
The age when you're like you don't talk to you don't tell your mom what you're into

1104
00:59:59,840 --> 01:00:00,840
because you're a teen.

1105
01:00:00,840 --> 01:00:01,840
So she's like, "I don't really like Spongebob I guess."

1106
01:00:01,840 --> 01:00:05,040
Plus I have this Etsy gift card I guess I'll do this.

1107
01:00:05,040 --> 01:00:09,200
But imagine how sick it would be if she was trying to order the Spongebob earn from that

1108
01:00:09,200 --> 01:00:12,000
Etsy store but she misclicked and accidentally got the beer keg one.

1109
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:13,000
True.

1110
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:16,200
The beer keg one I was like put me in that.

1111
01:00:16,200 --> 01:00:18,920
Actually kill me now just so I can spend my time in that.

1112
01:00:18,920 --> 01:00:19,920
It's pretty cool.

1113
01:00:19,920 --> 01:00:24,360
There's one that just had the Bud Ice logo on it and then one that had like Natty Light.

1114
01:00:24,360 --> 01:00:27,560
What kind of urn would you guys want to be put in?

1115
01:00:27,560 --> 01:00:29,480
Me?

1116
01:00:29,480 --> 01:00:32,800
One that's like shaped like a pool.

1117
01:00:32,800 --> 01:00:33,800
Oh that's cool.

1118
01:00:33,800 --> 01:00:37,920
I want a clear one so nobody can mess with my stuff.

1119
01:00:37,920 --> 01:00:39,680
Nobody can mess with the stuff in there.

1120
01:00:39,680 --> 01:00:45,440
Because otherwise people are going to be like, I'm walking around and I'm holding a glass

1121
01:00:45,440 --> 01:00:46,920
of milk, I don't feel like finishing it.

1122
01:00:46,920 --> 01:00:47,920
It's going in the urn.

1123
01:00:47,920 --> 01:00:49,880
It's opaque, you can't see it.

1124
01:00:49,880 --> 01:00:55,160
My dad had my grandma's ashes in the living room for like years when I was a kid.

1125
01:00:55,160 --> 01:00:57,160
Like her urn was like above our TV.

1126
01:00:57,160 --> 01:01:01,880
And I was like, I always wondered what it was because like the urn kind of like looked like a...

1127
01:01:01,880 --> 01:01:03,880
Like a PlayStation?

1128
01:01:03,880 --> 01:01:05,880
[Laughter]

1129
01:01:05,880 --> 01:01:09,880
I didn't find out it was an urn until I was like seven or eight years old.

1130
01:01:09,880 --> 01:01:11,880
I think my dad was like pointing it out and was like, "Yeah, that's your grandma."

1131
01:01:11,880 --> 01:01:13,880
And I was like, "What?"

1132
01:01:13,880 --> 01:01:17,880
Because it was kind of shaped like an old, like the palace from Mulan.

1133
01:01:17,880 --> 01:01:22,480
yeah yeah so it's like oh like what is that why is that box up there it's like

1134
01:01:22,480 --> 01:01:26,160
oh that's your fucking grandma it's like oh cool people just get burned alive

1135
01:01:26,160 --> 01:01:29,840
like that's like it's pretty scary such a weird thing to learn as a kid I don't

1136
01:01:29,840 --> 01:01:35,080
really put into a dragon egg or used to like cut cocaine yeah I think that'd be

1137
01:01:35,080 --> 01:01:39,680
