00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:35,320
Patrick's having an accident right now.

16
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:38,860
It's actually taking him so long to do the accident, though, so it's not that- it's not

17
00:00:38,860 --> 00:00:39,860
working that well.

18
00:00:39,860 --> 00:00:44,400
Oh, he had to switch accidents and put a new accident on the accident table.

19
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:47,480
If you had, like, were holding your piss for a long time and then you accidentally peed

20
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:49,640
your pants, but it just came out so slow.

21
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:52,160
How embarrassing would that be?

22
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:53,160
That would-

23
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:55,400
Just one drop at a time, just slowly going down your pants.

24
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:58,960
I feel like that's easier- you can just say that's sweat, dude.

25
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:04,160
No, just you can just see it like like the spot on the front of your pants just growing just like so

26
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:15,440
All right, so you have a turntable that's the that's the accident prank that you pulled on us

35
00:01:55,720 --> 00:02:05,000
single word. I think I might have already fucked up the needle on this just

36
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,600
because I'm like I've never... Yeah, what were you trying to use it to sew because

37
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:12,820
you're a girl? Yes. Were you putting it in your pee hole trying to fucking sound

38
00:02:12,820 --> 00:02:17,540
with it? Yes I was. Because you're a girl? Yes. Speak it... talk about sounding I mean...

39
00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:23,320
Caleb where's your fucking hat? My hat? It's off my damn head. Where... I fucking I

40
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:27,000

41
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,880
Kill 30 seconds I got this. Okay. Okay. He's going to get his hat. God, it's so mean.

42
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:37,560
Like I get him something. It was, it was a, looked like a really expensive hat. It

43
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:42,840
was. It was so expensive. It had a, $6. It had a special unique marking on the back too.

44
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:47,960
Yeah. That was really beautiful. It was, it's put there by a graffiti tagger. It was

45
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:55,340
tie-dyed. Yeah. There it is. This is a very rare hat. You see it started to get tie-dyed

46
00:02:55,340 --> 00:02:59,420
in the factory but they took it out early so it only got two dots of tie-dye on it so

47
00:02:59,420 --> 00:03:07,060
it's worth a lot of money. I'm back. See, I put him on. It's a good hat. It looks good

48
00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:13,080
on you. Dude, Pat literally puts me on game like two, three times a year he puts me on

49
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:18,300
game. Bought me that gnome outfit. This kingdom hearts hat. I only brought half the gnome

50
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:22,940
outfit back to New York. What the fuck? It wouldn't fit in my suitcase. I had to decide

51
00:03:22,940 --> 00:03:28,540
between my favorite shirt or half the gnome outfit. Put it in a grocery bag and bring

52
00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:32,940
it home. I can have my mom ship it to me I guess, but that's fucking crazy. That's so

53
00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:35,980
fucked up that you didn't bring the gnome. How much space does a gnome outfit take up?

54
00:03:35,980 --> 00:03:40,820
It's a huge gnome outfit. It's not that big. It's really thick felt. That's true, it is

55
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:45,780
a very big I did buy the biggest one I could not fit it in my suitcase yeah and

56
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:50,260
I was Pat I was I was packed to the gills you had a wrap dude your suitcase is

57
00:03:50,260 --> 00:03:54,120
just a little walnut shell that you pull around on a string because you're one

58
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:58,180
foot tall that's not true actually it is for that one trip that I took a walnut

59
00:03:58,180 --> 00:04:02,340
on but the rest of my trips that's that's just not true and you're making

60
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:06,960
shit up again completely true you call it your nutcase I don't call it my

61
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:10,420
nutcase although if I did that'd be a pretty funny name for it that would be

62
00:04:10,420 --> 00:04:13,380
That is disrespectful on this day and you know it.

63
00:04:13,380 --> 00:04:14,380
What?

64
00:04:14,380 --> 00:04:15,380

119
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:47,940

See but unless you put the cigarette in your fucking pussy and your dick, what are you doing?

164
00:09:21,340 --> 00:09:25,340
Do you think somebody has ever put like a cigar in a butthole? Yeah.

165
00:09:25,340 --> 00:09:28,340
Fucking our president did that dude, what are you talking about?

166
00:09:28,340 --> 00:09:31,340
That's like one of the most famous sex things of all time.

167
00:09:31,340 --> 00:09:33,340
Putting a cigar in a pussy?

168
00:09:33,340 --> 00:09:39,340
Yeah dude, Bill Clinton put a cigar in what's-her-name's pussy.

169
00:09:39,340 --> 00:09:40,340
He did that to Monica?

170
00:09:40,340 --> 00:09:41,340
Yeah!

171
00:09:41,340 --> 00:09:47,540
No. Yes, dude. That's like the biggest, funniest part of the story. That's so fucked up. I don't believe that.

172
00:09:47,540 --> 00:09:52,800
I think it's pretty funny, dude. It's especially if she's a hero. Do you think she could blow smoke rings?

173
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:55,220
Yes. With her thing?

174
00:09:55,220 --> 00:09:56,900
Maybe.

175
00:09:56,900 --> 00:09:59,900
Who knows? It's possible. I mean, I feel like if you can...

176
00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:07,380
I'm declaring this now. We are pro Monica Lewinsky podcast. We are pro Bill Clinton, because that was the coolest shit of all time.

177
00:10:07,420 --> 00:10:13,140
Okay, I mean fucking kidding me dude. I would love to do that there. You'll be pro Clinton

178
00:10:13,140 --> 00:10:17,300
I'll be pro Lewinsky, and then we'll just have Cameron decides. Yeah, I'm pro. I'm

179
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:21,800
Yeah, I was gonna say I'm actually I'm pro God

180
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:26,920
Okay, God is not God is you know anything we can all agree on God

181
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:33,540
I can't agree with that cuz I'm pro what and dude yeah, dude. I'm about my whole lock you're putting you're putting oh, okay

00:10:33,540 --> 00:10:34,540
You know what, that makes sense.

183
00:10:34,540 --> 00:10:35,540
Dude, I'd put a cigar in anything.

184
00:10:35,540 --> 00:10:36,540
Yeah?

00:10:39,780 --> 00:10:40,780
And guess what?

189
00:10:40,780 --> 00:10:41,780
I'd just fucking smoke it.

190
00:10:41,780 --> 00:10:42,780
I wouldn't inhale it.

191
00:10:42,780 --> 00:10:44,020
That'll get you really sick, actually.

192
00:10:44,020 --> 00:10:45,020

00:10:48,020 --> 00:10:49,020
Have you inhaled it all in one pull?

197
00:10:49,020 --> 00:10:50,020
Did that a lot in high school.

198
00:10:50,020 --> 00:10:51,020

Did it a ton.

201
00:10:53,020 --> 00:10:55,820
There was a, like, my brother was on the football team and they had this thing where they would

202
00:10:55,820 --> 00:10:59,940
like go, after games, they would go to like somebody's house and it was called Meatballs

204
00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:09,420

205
00:11:09,420 --> 00:11:15,980

212
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:52,660
I used to I used to get cigars when I was like uh when I was like 18. What did you say?

213
00:11:54,260 --> 00:11:59,460
Is this one of those? Okay. This is not a fetish. This is just the coolest guy of all time.

214
00:11:59,460 --> 00:12:03,540
He's in a completely, it looks like a big rig truck. The cab is completely leather.

215
00:12:03,540 --> 00:12:05,620
Yeah, he's wearing a Bluetooth headset.

216
00:12:05,620 --> 00:12:06,980
Yeah, and he's smoking.

217
00:12:06,980 --> 00:12:09,300
And he's holding a cigar up to the camera,

218
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:12,500
like in the way that it looks like when they Photoshop a hand holding a joint.

219
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:20,020
I used to smoke cigars when I was like 18 because I didn't smoke cigarettes, but I,

220
00:12:20,020 --> 00:12:24,100
I like made a little bit of money by selling fake CBD to high schoolers

221
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:27,140
because they would sell them in like the smoke shops in North Carolina.

222
00:12:27,140 --> 00:12:28,740
How old were you when you did that?

223
00:12:28,740 --> 00:12:34,340
I was 18. I had like just turned 18. And my friend was like still in high school.

224
00:12:34,340 --> 00:12:39,060
And so we would buy like all this fake CBD shit from smoke shops and then

225
00:12:39,060 --> 00:12:39,540
Yeah.

226
00:12:39,540 --> 00:12:42,260
Sell it to high schoolers who thought that it was weed.

227
00:12:42,260 --> 00:12:47,540
And then we'd take the money and go buy like expensive cigars and smoke them in a playground.

228
00:12:47,540 --> 00:12:50,020
And they would always give me like the worst diarrhea.

229
00:12:50,020 --> 00:12:52,740
And I was like, "I'm like fucking Tony Soprano right now."

230
00:12:52,740 --> 00:12:54,740
Dude, cigars suck so much. I hate them.

231
00:12:54,740 --> 00:12:56,740
I've never smoked them.

232
00:12:56,740 --> 00:13:00,740
People at my high school graduation, a bunch of people smoked cigars.

233
00:13:00,740 --> 00:13:02,740
That was like a thing.

234
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:04,740
Yeah, that's so fucking stupid.

235
00:13:04,740 --> 00:13:06,740
Yeah, kids would like...

236
00:13:06,740 --> 00:13:08,740
The only time I'll ever smoke a cigar is if I had a...

237
00:13:08,740 --> 00:13:10,740
If I got like an "It's a boy" cigar.

238
00:13:10,740 --> 00:13:12,740
Or like a "It's a girl".

239
00:13:12,740 --> 00:13:14,740
I would smoke a cigar to celebrate a baby.

240
00:13:14,740 --> 00:13:18,740
The only time I smoke cigars is when I'm golfing, dude.

241
00:13:18,740 --> 00:13:20,740
Because I just transform into a different guy, though.

242
00:13:20,740 --> 00:13:26,260
though yeah yeah I basically go through a portal and I become kind of the coolest

243
00:13:26,260 --> 00:13:30,460
guy ever when I'm golfing so I gotta have a the you know I get like a Dutch master

244
00:13:30,460 --> 00:13:35,220

00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:33,500
You're the one who seemed interested in them I'm trying to teach you a lesson kid. There's a valuable life lesson

267
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:39,280
Yeah, smoke all these fucking Cubans that I stole and you're gonna drive my car

268
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:46,000

00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:52,520
For if you a buddy your funeral you wanna fucking you wanna fucking try the big cat that we keep in the in the front yard

270
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:54,200
Go ahead

271
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:58,940
It's always funny like your baby grabs onto your finger, and you just slap it and it's like hey man

272
00:15:58,940 --> 00:16:01,800
If you're a stranger you do that to me. That's what I would do you know no special

273
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:06,640
I'm just just teaching you lessons, man. This is how they raised Albert Einstein. You know they didn't talk to him like a baby

274
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:13,120
They would slap him around and fucking kick him and set him on fire. This is how they raised Albert Einstein and Gigi Allen

275
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:18,120
So you're gonna grow up really smart or really fun. They were in the son of the man. Oh

276
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:25,840
You want a baby smoking a cigar you got that I mean if you got the son of the mask

277
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:33,620
That guy that I mean that baby smoking for sure how fucked up would it be you fucking you your wife pops out

278
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:37,340
You've been waiting nine months dude. You've been waiting for this day your whole life

279
00:16:37,340 --> 00:16:42,960
You're finally a father your wife pops out the son of beautiful green son of the mask, baby

280
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:49,240
But it looks half son of the mask and you you remember you have a son of the mask mailman. Mm-hmm

281
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:51,560
Yeah, very scary

282
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:57,320
The the fucked up part about that movie is that he just wore the mask when he got his wife pregnant

283
00:16:57,320 --> 00:17:02,920
So if you wear like any mask by that by that logic if you wear any other man

284
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:05,320
- Yeah, well the sperm's put on a mask too.

285
00:17:05,320 --> 00:17:06,720
- Yeah.

286
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:11,000
- I'm gonna be ordering one of those Barack Obama masks.

287
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,400
One of those ones that they use for bank robberies.

288
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:14,320
- Yeah.

289
00:17:14,320 --> 00:17:16,400
- Order one of those and knock up my wife.

290
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:17,320
- Yeah.

291
00:17:17,320 --> 00:17:19,360
- Guess who's got a cool kid?

292
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:20,560
- Who's got no mama's son.

293
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:21,880
- Me.

294
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:23,600
Guess who's got Obama Jr.

295
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:24,600
Me.

296
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:27,000
- And that means he has to be the next president.

297
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,900
- Sir, you can't, it's not gonna,

298
00:17:28,900 --> 00:17:31,160
we can't name your kid Obama Jr.

299
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:32,860
That's not how this works.

300
00:17:32,860 --> 00:17:41,260
Listen, first of all, I saw the kid being born in front of me still think he's from Kenya.

301
00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:43,980
My wife was in a portal.

302
00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:46,940
It's the only way to explain this.

303
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:52,060
Interrupting sex with my wife to like run and put on an Arnold Schwarzenegger mask and she's

304
00:17:52,060 --> 00:17:53,060
like, "Why are you doing that?"

305
00:17:53,060 --> 00:17:54,060
And you're like, "No, just don't worry.

306
00:17:54,060 --> 00:17:55,060
No, it's going to be cool.

307
00:17:55,060 --> 00:17:56,060
Trust me.

308
00:17:56,060 --> 00:17:57,060
No, no, wait."

309
00:17:57,060 --> 00:17:58,060
And then just wait nine months, wait.

310
00:17:58,060 --> 00:18:02,380
And then like in the hospital, it's just a normal baby and you're just like, "Oh, fuck."

311
00:18:02,380 --> 00:18:06,540
just put the mask on him dude yeah that's why you just keep the mask they'll grow

312
00:18:06,540 --> 00:18:10,500
into it yeah that'll be his face pretty soon mm-hmm just give him a little bit

313
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:14,220
and then actually you know what it'll do cuz babies have soft heads it'll mold

314
00:18:14,220 --> 00:18:18,500
into the shape of exact Arnold's face you ever seen you ever seen those like

315
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:23,540
babies that have to wear the helmets all the time yeah yeah yeah by looking in a

316
00:18:23,540 --> 00:18:29,140
mirror that you were looking in okay owned my younger sibling had to wear a

317
00:18:29,140 --> 00:18:34,180

00:18:34,180 --> 00:18:39,060
yeah like a baby helmet it like they look very cool it looks like they always make

319
00:18:39,060 --> 00:18:43,500
them with like psychedelic colors on them for some reason like a normal helmet

320
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:49,300
yeah check out my BMX baby maybe it's so the baby like likes wearing it yeah no

321
00:18:49,300 --> 00:18:56,340
there's a baby doesn't like that it was just high as hell the baby it's on its

322
00:18:56,340 --> 00:19:00,240
fucking head well what if the baby looks in the mirror true babies don't

323
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:03,500
recognize their reflections as themselves I think that their dogs it's

324
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:12,660
true that's just the facts yeah yeah oh is it wearing that fucking ugly helmet

325
00:19:12,660 --> 00:19:18,060
oh I'm gonna run at it that's true if your baby is wearing one of those

326
00:19:18,060 --> 00:19:22,180
helmets you can run into anything yeah that's that is actually true you don't

327
00:19:22,180 --> 00:19:29,180
have to babyproof anything. Exactly. If you live in... Take those skates off the stairs. I should start wearing a helmet.

328
00:19:29,180 --> 00:19:35,380
Yeah, you skateboard nine hours a day. No, not when I skate. Oh, take it off to skate.

329
00:19:35,380 --> 00:19:39,660
Pulling up, pulling up, like wearing the helmet and then just immediately taking

330
00:19:39,660 --> 00:19:43,860
it off and like fucking up just like an Ollie so bad. Just breaking your

331
00:19:43,860 --> 00:19:49,180
brain. Yeah, just destroy my head. I'm really excited to see... Just walking around wearing a helmet and not like having, not

332
00:19:49,180 --> 00:19:52,180
carrying a skateboard or anything, just like having a helmet. Like one of the

333
00:19:52,180 --> 00:19:57,780
pro-tech, like the pro-tech 70s style helmets that have like the ear

334
00:19:57,780 --> 00:20:03,860
cushion or like the ear plastic. You ever see those ones? Yeah. Like a baseball helmet.

335
00:20:03,860 --> 00:20:08,500
Oh man. Like a knight's helmet. I'm pretty excited to continue being friends with

336
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:12,420
Pat for the next like 10 years or so as just like the CTE starts catching up

337
00:20:12,420 --> 00:20:17,500
with him and he becomes more and more like violent and evil and drug addicted.

338
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:22,900
It's gonna be pretty fun. Yeah. Yeah, you think I'm gonna get CTE from skateboarding. I think you already have

339
00:20:22,900 --> 00:20:31,080
To get CTE, you might have you might have such a powerful skull that it's kind of blocked everything

340
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:37,620
I did I I went to I went to Blue Park and immediately fucked up like a warm-up trick and fell to my head

341
00:20:43,220 --> 00:20:49,540
fell to my death. I did I fell hit like the back of my head and like I have I

342
00:20:49,540 --> 00:20:56,300
really haven't felt the same since so. Welcome to New York baby! You have to hit

343
00:20:56,300 --> 00:20:58,980
it on the other side of your head so yeah brain back into the right

344
00:20:58,980 --> 00:21:04,220
coordinates. It is I did I did kind of have like a headache and it cured my

345
00:21:04,220 --> 00:21:08,920
headache so maybe. So maybe you already maybe you feel the most normal you've

346
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:14,440
ever been yeah did you get it did you get a goose egg no I wish I did I got one of

347
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:18,480
those in elementary school I tripped and I was well I tripped and I have my hands

348
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:21,120
in my pocket

349
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:30,960
that makes sense that you just walked around as a kid with your hands in your

350
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:39,040
pockets all the time. Oh boy. I was already, I was an early Travis Bickle. At least you

351
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:44,280
weren't one of those, one of those belt loop kids. You know those ones? Oh yeah. Those thumbs

352
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:49,560
and their belt loops. What the fuck is wrong with you dude? Yeah. You're no cowboy. No I

353
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:55,080
was also a thumbs in the sweatshirt sleeves kid. Oh you cut the wolves out? I chewed them

354
00:21:55,080 --> 00:22:02,300
out baby yeah yeah he's a real freak yeah powerful jaws I would hate for you to

355
00:22:02,300 --> 00:22:07,020
fucking death roll me oh yeah did you guys ever chew on on your sleeves or

356
00:22:07,020 --> 00:22:11,800
your clothing and yeah I did cuz I loved the taste of my own salt yeah and I just

357
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:16,340
fucking sit there chewing on my just ruin all my long-sleeve shirts. I chewed on like my sweatshirt

358
00:22:16,340 --> 00:22:24,220
sleeves too much and my parents told me that there was a kid who did it. My parents told me that

359
00:22:24,220 --> 00:22:29,020
there's a kid who did that once and all the stuff that he chewed went into his

360
00:22:29,020 --> 00:22:34,620
stomach and stayed there and they had to remove a giant ball of sweatshirt from his stomach with surgery.

361
00:22:34,620 --> 00:22:38,220
And it didn't even stop me, that's how much I liked it.

362
00:22:38,220 --> 00:22:40,420
I believe that though, I believe that could happen.

363
00:22:40,420 --> 00:22:43,820
Yeah dude, there's microplastics when you drink a water bottle.

364
00:22:43,820 --> 00:22:48,620
It makes sense that if you spend all your time chewing on a sweatshirt sleeve you get probably some lint in there.

365
00:22:48,620 --> 00:22:51,420
Okay, but a sweatshirt sleeve is not gonna do that, it's food and water that's gonna do that.

366
00:22:51,420 --> 00:22:56,460
The lint is gonna just fall out of your ass. It's not gonna stick in your gut.

367
00:22:56,460 --> 00:22:58,380
Imagine taking a shit and it's all lint.

368
00:22:58,380 --> 00:22:59,760
Damn.

369
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:02,460
Did you guys ever have to shit a-

370
00:23:02,460 --> 00:23:06,860
You have to scrape it out like a lint trap and then wash it in the dryer sheet.

371
00:23:06,860 --> 00:23:12,620
Oh fuck dude. You just keep pulling it and there's like more than you expected as you pull it out.

372
00:23:12,620 --> 00:23:17,260
You have to put in that like the mesh dryer sheet and then pull it out a bunch of times.

373
00:23:17,260 --> 00:23:19,900
You're sticking a cheese grater in your ass to use.

374
00:23:20,860 --> 00:23:24,540
Oh, oh, oh, cheese grater in your ass, dude.

375
00:23:24,540 --> 00:23:27,040
What the hell are you doing doing that, Nishty?

376
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:30,240
It's been a while since we had to go back on something like that.

377
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:31,240
Yeah.

378
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:32,240
Yeah, you're right.

379
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:33,240
We've been sticking to our guns recently.

380
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:34,960
We've been a little less gross, I think, maybe.

381
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:36,080
We need to be a little safe.

382
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:37,200
We need to maybe step it up.

383
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:41,520
What do you guys think of this helmet for me to wear all the time?

384
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:42,520
This is a $70...

385
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:45,760
I sent Caleb a helmet he could wear all the time.

386
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:47,360
I don't need a helmet, dude.

387
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:49,120
Do you have the helmet I sent you?

388
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:51,120
You bought a- you got a- you got a helmet and you haven't been wearing it?

389
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:56,120
He got me a Paw Patrol helmet and it was- it won't even fit on the top of my fucking head.

390
00:23:56,120 --> 00:23:57,620
*laughter*

391
00:23:57,620 --> 00:24:00,620
Cam, take a look at this hat. This is how you give a gift.

392
00:24:00,620 --> 00:24:03,120
A Paw Patrol helmet?

393
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:05,120
Paw Patrol helmet's a good gift.

394
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:06,120
*laughter*

395
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:07,620
Listen, this is a Kingdom Hearts hat.

396
00:24:07,620 --> 00:24:09,620
There's so many ways you can hurt yourself.

397
00:24:09,620 --> 00:24:11,120
A Paw Patrol helmet's for a child.

398
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:15,120
Dude, you- you're really important to me and I don't want you to hurt your head.

399
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:16,120
*laughter*

400
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:18,620
It only would protect the top of my head!

401
00:24:19,620 --> 00:24:21,620
It would only protect

402
00:24:21,620 --> 00:24:29,900
Your head on the top of your mouse hole, okay, I don't live in a mouse hole

403
00:24:29,900 --> 00:24:36,640
Start doing jumping jacks under the stove

404
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:40,300
I'm not small

405
00:24:40,300 --> 00:24:45,220
Normal can't Cameron and I will put our money together. We'll get Caleb

406
00:24:45,820 --> 00:24:50,100
Expensive could it be we'll get Caleb up the biggest Paw Patrol helmet we can find

407
00:24:50,100 --> 00:24:54,340
Biggest helmet in the world

408
00:24:54,340 --> 00:24:58,980
Okay, all right, well here's a little flaw in your logic

409
00:24:58,980 --> 00:25:04,380
How can I be both as small as a mouse and need the biggest helmet in the world?

410
00:25:04,380 --> 00:25:07,060
hydrocephaly

411
00:25:07,060 --> 00:25:09,060
Hydrocephaly my cousin has that

412
00:25:09,060 --> 00:25:11,420
What's that? What's your cousin? Yeah

413
00:25:13,260 --> 00:25:18,180
Set too much water in your head. Yeah, okay. Well, I'm such a genius with Latin

414
00:25:18,180 --> 00:25:21,100
Paw Patrol motorcycle

415
00:25:21,100 --> 00:25:23,100
Paw Patrol biggest helmet

416
00:25:23,100 --> 00:25:30,860
Yeah here I'll send this is the one that I got Caleb look at this look at this helmet

417
00:25:30,860 --> 00:25:34,260
Can you don't get a helmet unless it'll fit on a 33-inch rim?

418
00:25:34,260 --> 00:25:40,860
Ungrateful look at how cool this helmet is put that helmet on right now. It's at my mom's house with the gnome outfit

419
00:25:40,860 --> 00:25:41,860
Fuck you!

420
00:25:41,860 --> 00:25:42,860
What the fuck?

421
00:25:42,860 --> 00:25:43,860
He left both of our presents.

422
00:25:43,860 --> 00:25:46,300
How could I fit- if I can't fit a fucking outfit into my suitcase-

423
00:25:46,300 --> 00:25:47,300
Put it on and you can wear it on the plane.

424
00:25:47,300 --> 00:25:51,300
How am I gonna fit- I thought it was a- I thought it was so small, Caleb.

425
00:25:51,300 --> 00:25:52,300
You can get through TSA wearing a helmet.

426
00:25:52,300 --> 00:25:56,460
I thought it was such a small helmet and now it's too big to fit in your suitcase.

427
00:25:56,460 --> 00:26:01,140
It's actually rigid if you fucking knew what you bought, 'cause it's a fucking helmet,

428
00:26:01,140 --> 00:26:03,260
and because of the shape it wouldn't fit.

429
00:26:03,260 --> 00:26:07,140
Would I have loved to have bring it and make Janna find a place to store it?

430
00:26:07,140 --> 00:26:08,140
Yes.

431
00:26:08,140 --> 00:26:10,580
Why don't you just wear your nutcase as a helmet?

432
00:26:10,580 --> 00:26:16,540
Every time I buy something or get something like this hat, Jana just gives me a deep sigh

433
00:26:16,540 --> 00:26:19,340
because she has to figure out where to hide it.

434
00:26:19,340 --> 00:26:24,180
I just told her today that I ordered a Rick and Morty sweatsuit and she was like, "Oh

435
00:26:24,180 --> 00:26:25,980
fuck, what are you fucking doing?"

436
00:26:25,980 --> 00:26:30,300
I have my nice computer desk where I can just stack everything that I want but don't want

437
00:26:30,300 --> 00:26:31,300
to put away.

438
00:26:31,300 --> 00:26:32,300
I just throw everything in a corner.

439
00:26:32,300 --> 00:26:33,300
Yeah, exactly.

440
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:34,300
This is my corner.

441
00:26:34,300 --> 00:26:39,940
everything that's everything that's not important is is stacked up right here

442
00:26:39,940 --> 00:26:44,500
hindering my ability to do anything and that's the problem these are my

443
00:26:44,500 --> 00:26:51,420
most important items items that I own you know Kingdom Hearts hat Paw Patrol

444
00:26:51,420 --> 00:26:56,700
their helmet need to give us inventories I agree you should get an inventory and

445
00:26:56,700 --> 00:27:00,340
you should you should be able to become over encumbered though because I think

446
00:27:00,340 --> 00:27:03,180
that would be funny to see people have that on the street yeah it's true just

447
00:27:03,180 --> 00:27:04,240
- Just giving you things, people are like,

448
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:05,860
"Please, please take my pants,

449
00:27:05,860 --> 00:27:07,180
"I've become over encumbered."

450
00:27:07,180 --> 00:27:10,040
- Watching somebody just drop a diamond.

451
00:27:10,040 --> 00:27:11,820
- Can you please, please, I have--

452
00:27:11,820 --> 00:27:12,820
- Yeah, please somebody dropping a diamond

453
00:27:12,820 --> 00:27:14,220
to switch it out with something else

454
00:27:14,220 --> 00:27:16,020
and you grab it really quick.

455
00:27:16,020 --> 00:27:16,860
- Dude, that would be the best feeling in the world.

456
00:27:16,860 --> 00:27:17,700
- No, it's in my inventory.

457
00:27:17,700 --> 00:27:19,060
It's in my inventory, you can't do it.

458
00:27:19,060 --> 00:27:20,020
You can't touch it.

459
00:27:20,020 --> 00:27:20,860
- What do you mean?

460
00:27:20,860 --> 00:27:22,580
I didn't take that diamond.

461
00:27:22,580 --> 00:27:24,060
- It'd be a cool pickup line too,

462
00:27:24,060 --> 00:27:27,740
where you'd be like, "I've become over encumbered and--"

463
00:27:27,740 --> 00:27:29,300
- I need to store something in your house.

464
00:27:29,300 --> 00:27:32,100
- I need to put my, I need to store my cum

465
00:27:32,100 --> 00:27:37,300
your inventory. I'm too encumbered right now and I need to get rid of some items.

466
00:27:37,300 --> 00:27:42,580
Yeah I need to get rid of my phone number. Yeah there we go. That's right well

467
00:27:42,580 --> 00:27:49,420
that's a little less former. And the inside cover of Infinite Jest. So damn heavy. I need to get rid of my phone number which I wrote with my

468
00:27:49,420 --> 00:27:57,100
finger in a puddle of my cum right next to you. So you're gonna have to take this cum either way.

469
00:27:57,660 --> 00:28:03,980
yeah so there's okay I'm on the helmet website still and there's on this one

470
00:28:03,980 --> 00:28:09,180
specifically pro tech they have they have like full tech and then they have

471
00:28:09,180 --> 00:28:13,540
full tech certified which I don't know what certified I hate tech in this

472
00:28:13,540 --> 00:28:17,780
situation I will never you will never catch me buying anything tech does that

473
00:28:17,780 --> 00:28:25,220
mean it's like certified like like thing it just means as a stamp certified is in

474
00:28:25,220 --> 00:28:29,700
like it's certified to protect your head and then there's like some of them that

475
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:34,060
aren't certified because I mean why not just get all the helmet certified it

476
00:28:34,060 --> 00:28:39,420
means in it's kind of in a gangster way you know okay oh he's certified okay it's

477
00:28:39,420 --> 00:28:43,660
like that all right so I should buy the certified helmet that cost I did I said

478
00:28:43,660 --> 00:28:51,700
$25 I found an $80 motorcycle Paw Patrol helmet how big as a visor and everything

479
00:28:51,700 --> 00:28:53,700
These boys better start pitching in.

480
00:28:53,700 --> 00:28:54,700
I mean, I'll wear it.

481
00:28:54,700 --> 00:28:55,700
Let me see it.

482
00:28:55,700 --> 00:28:56,700
I don't have a motorcycle.

483
00:28:56,700 --> 00:28:58,700
I don't even have a bike right now.

484
00:28:58,700 --> 00:28:59,700
I might get this.

485
00:28:59,700 --> 00:29:02,700
If we buy this for you, you're wearing this fucking everywhere.

486
00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:05,700
I don't ever want to see you with this not on your head.

487
00:29:05,700 --> 00:29:06,700
I might get this pink flame helmet.

488
00:29:06,700 --> 00:29:08,700
I don't have a choice in it?

489
00:29:08,700 --> 00:29:09,700
Absolutely not.

490
00:29:09,700 --> 00:29:10,700
Oh, dude.

491
00:29:10,700 --> 00:29:11,700
That thing says fucking beast.

492
00:29:11,700 --> 00:29:18,700
This is called the 713 Junior, and it says, "The 713 Junior is the helmet created for smaller customers."

493
00:29:18,700 --> 00:29:19,700
This is good for Caleb.

494
00:29:19,700 --> 00:29:20,700
I'm not small.

495
00:29:20,700 --> 00:29:28,260
small I mean humongous. This is on outletmoto.edu. Yeah there's an Italian website selling a

496
00:29:28,260 --> 00:29:35,900
Paw Patrol motorcycle helmet. It's got an anti-scratch visor. I don't need this crap

497
00:29:35,900 --> 00:29:43,020
dude. Tell you what I need. It looks so good. I need an RFID reader and some grubhubbed

498
00:29:43,020 --> 00:29:46,260
Taco Bell. How about you guys take care of that first. Nah that's not happening. What

499
00:29:46,260 --> 00:29:48,260
What are you gonna do with the RFID reader?

500
00:29:48,260 --> 00:29:50,260
Probably steal a bunch of numbers.

501
00:29:50,260 --> 00:29:52,260
Yeah? Like just random shit?

502
00:29:52,260 --> 00:29:54,260
Like what, seven?

503
00:29:54,260 --> 00:29:56,260
Yeah, I'm just gonna steal some random numbers.

504
00:29:56,260 --> 00:29:58,260
I read some book in high school

505
00:29:58,260 --> 00:30:00,260
where a guy had like an

506
00:30:00,260 --> 00:30:02,260
RFID like cloner

507
00:30:02,260 --> 00:30:04,260
so he could like steal people's

508
00:30:04,260 --> 00:30:06,260
credit cards and stuff.

509
00:30:06,260 --> 00:30:08,260
I don't think that's a real thing,

510
00:30:08,260 --> 00:30:10,260
but they do sell like wallets

511
00:30:10,260 --> 00:30:12,260
that are like,

512
00:30:12,260 --> 00:30:14,260
to stop this super villain

513
00:30:14,260 --> 00:30:19,740
just do that with like tinfoil. I mean the thing is like credit cards and shit are

514
00:30:19,740 --> 00:30:22,980
more complicated but you can absolutely like do RFID cloning with like library

515
00:30:22,980 --> 00:30:27,700
books and stuff because yeah yeah it's not like it's not like doesn't matter

516
00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:33,140
and again simple single numbers is what I would start doing. Every library could

517
00:30:33,140 --> 00:30:35,700
burn to the ground it wouldn't change anything in the world. If somebody had a

518
00:30:35,700 --> 00:30:40,060
maybe like a yeah a 10 or a 15 stuck on their computer I would definitely

519
00:30:40,060 --> 00:30:45,340
definitely clone that. Yeah. Yeah. And then I'd be like, you, you have been, um, you've

520
00:30:45,340 --> 00:30:49,980
been hacked by it. I wouldn't steal any numbers cause I wouldn't know what to do with them.

521
00:30:49,980 --> 00:30:55,100
I'd add them up. Yeah. Yeah. I'm going to steal all these numbers from people's fucking phones

522
00:30:55,100 --> 00:31:00,100
and computers. Add them up. Guess who's got the biggest number now. Ooh, that would be

523
00:31:00,100 --> 00:31:04,580
fun though. Just to like steal our numbers and then just add. Yeah. And then gets the

524
00:31:04,580 --> 00:31:08,140
biggest number. And then I get the biggest number. I would just want to, while we're talking

525
00:31:08,140 --> 00:31:12,640
about this I want to put out there all the fans I don't care if I'm not right

526
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:16,100
about the RFID thing don't message me about it okay I didn't need the message

527
00:31:16,100 --> 00:31:20,180
but I was wrong about Komodo dragons okay what did you what did they correct?

528
00:31:20,180 --> 00:31:24,700
They said it wasn't bacteria in their saliva it was venom

529
00:31:24,700 --> 00:31:30,420
oh wait okay nerd wait I was right about the venom no hold on

530
00:31:30,420 --> 00:31:36,340
where did you say they had venom? Oh my god Pat is so smart I don't really

531
00:31:36,340 --> 00:31:38,340
You're like a dragon-ologist.

532
00:31:38,340 --> 00:31:40,340
It's true.

533
00:31:40,340 --> 00:31:42,340
What the fuck?

534
00:31:42,340 --> 00:31:46,340
I don't think anybody's ever corrected me on anything because I've always been right on the podcast pretty much.

535
00:31:46,340 --> 00:31:48,340
I don't know about that.

536
00:31:48,340 --> 00:31:50,340
Well I do because I'm correcting you on that.

537
00:31:50,340 --> 00:31:52,340
I'm giving you a Pinocchio right now.

538
00:31:52,340 --> 00:31:56,340
I'm going to give you a Pinocchio if you fucking don't put some clothes on.

539
00:31:56,340 --> 00:31:58,340
I have clothes on.

540
00:31:58,340 --> 00:32:00,340
I'm going to put my Pinosin-yo.

541
00:32:00,340 --> 00:32:02,340
[laughter]

542
00:32:04,340 --> 00:32:07,220
Yeah, that's what I meant. Yeah, that's pretty good.

543
00:32:07,220 --> 00:32:15,300
Well, the thing is you just to just turn off your your message requests and just say whatever you want on this damn thing dude

544
00:32:15,300 --> 00:32:18,760
What are they gonna do? Yeah, cancel their subscription. I don't fucking think so

545
00:32:18,760 --> 00:32:27,700
Yeah, no fucking shot. You guys need us. You need me. Mm-hmm. Look at me in my hat. You need this and

546
00:32:27,700 --> 00:32:33,820
I'll have to take a screenshot. Helmet Moto, Jet Child, BHR 713, Nickelodeon, Rubble, Paw Patrol

547
00:32:33,820 --> 00:32:39,020
And we need to keep spending our money on stupid shit like this. So stick around.

548
00:32:39,020 --> 00:32:47,260
Helmets and snowboards and ski passes. Rick and Morty backwood sweatsuit and trip to Breckenridge.

549
00:32:47,260 --> 00:32:49,460
Yep. Yep.

550
00:32:49,460 --> 00:32:54,420
Which is what we've just planned right now. And an M16 which we keep in like different parts

551
00:32:54,420 --> 00:32:58,500
at each one of our houses so that we can't get in trouble for it. That would be so cool.

552
00:32:58,500 --> 00:33:02,140
Wouldn't that be pretty smart, right? We all get like a couple of parts of a gun. I would get the receiver.

553
00:33:03,100 --> 00:33:07,700
I'm gonna get the I'm gonna get the gun. I'll get I call the bullets. I want the trigger

554
00:33:07,700 --> 00:33:09,900
Is get what do you guys gonna do?

555
00:33:09,900 --> 00:33:14,100
Cuz this is what you do if this is in case any any two of us turn on one of us

556
00:33:14,100 --> 00:33:16,820
We we we only have some of the gun

557
00:33:16,820 --> 00:33:21,820
We can't buy the rest of the gun

558
00:33:21,820 --> 00:33:24,300
Yeah, we only well, that's one of the rules

559
00:33:24,300 --> 00:33:28,740
Yeah, we only have some parts of the guns were like

560
00:33:30,700 --> 00:33:34,940
Patrick we got a shoot him in the head. Oh, we only have the bullets in the trigger

561
00:33:34,940 --> 00:33:37,420
And the rule is that we can't buy the other

562
00:33:37,420 --> 00:33:40,420
Do I

563
00:33:40,420 --> 00:33:44,100
Guess I guess we could throw the bullets at him. Yeah

564
00:33:44,100 --> 00:33:48,800
Well, what they don't tell you about guns is the trigger does pretty much everything if you just have a trigger and you put a

565
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:52,980
Bullet on it and you pull the trigger the bolts gonna shoot out. Yeah, it's just to make it look cool

566
00:33:52,980 --> 00:33:58,340
The trigger has like a hammer attached. It'll hit the back of the bullet and it'll fucking send anything flying. Mm-hmm

567
00:33:58,380 --> 00:34:03,660
It's kind of genius dude. Yeah, our guns powered by like electricity

568
00:34:03,660 --> 00:34:12,700
Batteries in them, I think they're powered by gun powder. Yes. It's oh, yeah, probably gunpowder

569
00:34:12,700 --> 00:34:16,520
I've shot quite a few guns and I've just never understood how they work

570
00:34:16,520 --> 00:34:21,340
I get how like a like a flintlock pistol works, but like an like a like a machine gun

571
00:34:21,340 --> 00:34:26,900
But it's got to have a machine in it, right? Yeah, it's got to be some triple-a batteries in this thing

572
00:34:27,940 --> 00:34:31,660
actually those are my those are probably D batteries cuz that'd be a pretty big

573
00:34:31,660 --> 00:34:36,500
the um you guys know about the like ancient guns that that China invented

574
00:34:36,500 --> 00:34:39,940
like gunpowder before everyone else they used to guns used to like the

575
00:34:39,940 --> 00:34:44,320
original gun like look like a spear like it's like a long pole and then it has

576
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:47,900
like a gun barrel on the end of the pole and you like put the gunpowder and the

577
00:34:47,900 --> 00:34:51,540
bullet in and then you light it and then you just point it the person like it's

578
00:34:51,540 --> 00:34:55,020
like a wizard so it's just like a Roman candle pretty much yeah like a giant

579
00:34:55,020 --> 00:34:58,020
Yeah, the Italians came up with it first, fucker.

580
00:34:58,020 --> 00:35:00,020
That would have scared the shit out of me, dude.

581
00:35:00,020 --> 00:35:02,020
It's literally so cool.

582
00:35:02,020 --> 00:35:03,020
It's just like a random...

583
00:35:03,020 --> 00:35:04,020
This is like actually magic.

584
00:35:04,020 --> 00:35:08,020
Yeah, it's just like a random Chinese guy and somebody shoots fire at you out of nowhere.

585
00:35:08,020 --> 00:35:10,020
Yeah, with a staff.

586
00:35:10,020 --> 00:35:11,020
I'd be out, dude.

587
00:35:11,020 --> 00:35:13,020
I'd be getting out of Dodge.

588
00:35:13,020 --> 00:35:14,020
I'd be getting out of China.

589
00:35:14,020 --> 00:35:15,020
Yeah.

590
00:35:15,020 --> 00:35:16,020
I would never.

591
00:35:16,020 --> 00:35:19,020
I would never fuck with someone who had a big staff.

592
00:35:19,020 --> 00:35:21,020
Donatello from Ninja Turtles?

593
00:35:21,020 --> 00:35:22,020
No way.

594
00:35:22,020 --> 00:35:27,220
No way I would not go up against him because he also knows the computer and he could steal my numbers with this RFID

595
00:35:27,220 --> 00:35:33,300
That's true. He might hack your gun dude. He might hack the bullets right out of your gun with that RFID reader

596
00:35:33,300 --> 00:35:35,620
I can't imagine getting my numbers stolen

597
00:35:35,620 --> 00:35:38,420
It's gonna happen. That would suck so much

598
00:35:38,420 --> 00:35:41,300
Someone takes your numbers. Oh, yeah

599
00:35:41,300 --> 00:35:48,420
Oh, my numbers security number. Yeah, what if someone takes a social security number right off of your fucking car if my wallet ever gets stolen

600
00:35:49,140 --> 00:35:54,580
To me an RFID reader is just a camera that just can take photos of different numbers.

601
00:35:54,580 --> 00:35:57,180
You shouldn't keep your social security number in your wallet.

602
00:35:57,180 --> 00:35:58,180
Why not?

603
00:35:58,180 --> 00:35:59,180
I do.

604
00:35:59,180 --> 00:36:00,180
I know it.

605
00:36:00,180 --> 00:36:02,940
And I leave my wallet outside with my shoes.

606
00:36:02,940 --> 00:36:03,940
At this address.

607
00:36:03,940 --> 00:36:08,660
Yeah, it's a very, I live in a very eastern style apartment where we leave our shoes and

608
00:36:08,660 --> 00:36:11,700
our social security numbers outside of the door.

609
00:36:11,700 --> 00:36:14,100
You gotta take them out before you walk in.

610
00:36:14,100 --> 00:36:15,620
It's an eastern style apartment.

611
00:36:15,620 --> 00:36:18,720
also have you also have a magic staff to

612
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:20,900
defend against burglars

613
00:36:20,900 --> 00:36:23,980
breaking in and he's pointing this

614
00:36:23,980 --> 00:36:25,940
giant staff at them that's like sparking

615
00:36:25,940 --> 00:36:28,580
and shooting out like smoke and is going

616
00:36:28,580 --> 00:36:30,340
okay can you hold on a second like it

617
00:36:30,340 --> 00:36:32,260
has to wait wait wait you're gonna be so

618
00:36:32,260 --> 00:36:36,340
scared in just a minute just hold on and

619
00:36:36,340 --> 00:36:38,500
then it backfires and just blows your own head off

620
00:36:38,500 --> 00:36:40,500
ah fuck I was pointing it the wrong way

621
00:36:40,500 --> 00:36:42,500
oh oh shit oh shit do you know a guy that

622
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:44,860
fixes windows ah fuck

623
00:36:44,860 --> 00:36:48,700
Dude that's like when I when I went on my first uh my first date with Jay and I

624
00:36:48,700 --> 00:36:50,940
heard that I thought it was really funny to like

625
00:36:50,940 --> 00:36:55,340
bring out his like gun. Oh he was one of those guys? Yeah but

626
00:36:55,340 --> 00:36:59,100
he only has like a musket.

627
00:36:59,100 --> 00:37:10,220
He brought out like an antique like musket and he was like yeah he better uh

628
00:37:10,220 --> 00:37:14,380
and he was like he like couldn't keep it together he was laughing so hard.

629
00:37:14,380 --> 00:37:16,380
That's a really good bit.

630
00:37:16,380 --> 00:37:18,380
Yeah, bring the...

631
00:37:18,380 --> 00:37:20,380
back at 9pm or you know what's gonna happen.

632
00:37:20,380 --> 00:37:22,380
Like, what are you gonna do?

633
00:37:22,380 --> 00:37:24,380
You're gonna take 2 hours to load a musket

634
00:37:24,380 --> 00:37:26,380
and then shoot me and then

635
00:37:26,380 --> 00:37:28,380
be like the most famous guy ever

636
00:37:28,380 --> 00:37:30,380
cause you killed a guy with a musket.

637
00:37:30,380 --> 00:37:32,380

and they have to wait on the on the welcome mat for like two hours to finish

659
00:39:21,220 --> 00:39:25,220

00:39:25,220 --> 00:39:27,220
I hate my team like that.

661
00:39:27,220 --> 00:39:33,220
No, you have to download Hogwarts.Lua and MasterChiefNude.Lua and...

662
00:39:33,220 --> 00:39:39,220
This is Brian's House.RP.

663
00:39:39,220 --> 00:39:50,220
Yeah, so yeah, this is our house, pretty humble. We like to run it like RP, but we do have a beach house down on the Cape that is a prop hunt, if you ever...

664
00:39:50,220 --> 00:39:59,140
And it is a roleplay server so you will have to roleplay as a white guy while you're here.

665
00:39:59,140 --> 00:40:03,060
Just don't want to piss off dad, you know?

666
00:40:03,060 --> 00:40:08,420
Oh fuck.

00:40:08,420 --> 00:40:13,740
Just the surly teenager just being like "Fuck you dad" and just spawning like 50 headcrab

668
00:40:13,740 --> 00:40:18,260
zombies in your living room and storming out.

669
00:40:18,260 --> 00:40:22,180
Dude, I wish my dad had been protective like that, just threatened every girl I went on

670
00:40:22,180 --> 00:40:23,180
a date with.

671
00:40:23,180 --> 00:40:25,540

00:40:38,500 --> 00:40:41,460
Don't make me, and anything you do to him, I'm gonna be doing to you.

677
00:40:41,460 --> 00:40:47,300
No matter how much surgery I have to get to be able to do it.

739
00:44:29,260 --> 00:44:31,420
Hey, lace me up with this one.

740
00:44:31,420 --> 00:44:33,900
I was thinking, I was skating the other day

741
00:44:33,900 --> 00:44:35,740
and just like the thought popped into my head

742
00:44:35,740 --> 00:44:38,560
just like white guy with weekend haircut.

743
00:44:38,560 --> 00:44:41,820
Dude, you fucking head to an H&M, look at the walls dude.

744
00:44:41,820 --> 00:44:43,780
They have 'em, yeah.

745
00:44:43,780 --> 00:44:45,660
Those guys exist.

746
00:44:45,660 --> 00:44:47,300
Yeah, I wanna see 'em.

747
00:44:47,300 --> 00:44:49,100
I mean, search it up brother.

748
00:44:49,100 --> 00:44:53,780
Do you think like, oh yeah, I guess, yeah that makes sense.

749
00:44:54,820 --> 00:44:58,080
'Cause his haircut is one that white guys can kinda do

750
00:44:58,080 --> 00:45:01,020
'cause it's like a made up haircut, you know?

751
00:45:01,020 --> 00:45:03,620
They're not really like stealing it from any kind of person,

752
00:45:03,620 --> 00:45:05,380
they're stealing it from The Weeknd.

753
00:45:05,380 --> 00:45:06,620
Yeah, it's true.

754
00:45:06,620 --> 00:45:08,420
They just take his giant hair and they're like,

755
00:45:08,420 --> 00:45:09,260
yeah, this is pretty sick.

756
00:45:09,260 --> 00:45:11,280
Well, he doesn't have it anymore.

757
00:45:11,280 --> 00:45:13,180
You're right, now he just has short hair.

758
00:45:13,180 --> 00:45:14,660
So that would be a problem.

759
00:45:14,660 --> 00:45:18,300
Honestly, you got a good musician.

760
00:45:18,300 --> 00:45:21,060
I'm glad you got that out.

761
00:45:21,060 --> 00:45:23,100
Yeah, I'm glad that people needed to know.

762
00:45:23,100 --> 00:45:25,100
People need to know my opinion on The Weeknd.

763
00:45:25,100 --> 00:45:27,100
On The Weeknd, yeah.

764
00:45:27,100 --> 00:45:35,100
People think I'm not a guy who would like The Weeknd, but I worked at a job where every time that we closed they would just play The Weeknd.

765
00:45:35,100 --> 00:45:38,100
And I started to enjoy his music.

766
00:45:38,100 --> 00:45:42,100
Hey man, when I worked a job I would play on The Weeknd too, because I didn't have to come in.

767
00:45:42,100 --> 00:45:43,100
That's right.

768
00:45:43,100 --> 00:45:44,100
That's fuckin' right.

769
00:45:44,100 --> 00:45:47,100
I mean, what a great name for an artist too. It's your favorite thing.

770
00:45:47,100 --> 00:45:48,100
The Weeknd?

771
00:45:48,100 --> 00:45:50,100
Yeah, you can't not like him.

772
00:45:50,100 --> 00:45:53,720
you're kind of already conditioned to like it no matter what. Somebody should make a

773
00:45:53,720 --> 00:45:59,220
hilarious Twitter account. Okay, okay. Wait, I think I have an idea here. Uh-huh.

774
00:45:59,220 --> 00:46:05,580
They wear it every day on Friday. Mm-hmm. Or whatever day that fucking shit...

775
00:46:05,580 --> 00:46:11,060
Whatever day the weekend starts, who knows. Yeah, nobody knows. Still up for debate. They put a guy

776
00:46:11,060 --> 00:46:16,900
saying something. Okay. What if on Twitter you could do something where

777
00:46:16,900 --> 00:46:21,020
every time something happens, a video of a guy saying something.

778
00:46:21,020 --> 00:46:23,020
Someone should make one of those with me.

779
00:46:23,020 --> 00:46:24,020
Yeah?

780
00:46:24,020 --> 00:46:25,020
Yeah.

781
00:46:25,020 --> 00:46:26,020
Me too.

782
00:46:26,020 --> 00:46:27,020
Me?

783
00:46:27,020 --> 00:46:28,020
No, you can't steal my-

784
00:46:28,020 --> 00:46:29,020
Me first.

785
00:46:29,020 --> 00:46:30,020
No, I already said it first.

786
00:46:30,020 --> 00:46:31,020
Wait, me too.

787
00:46:31,020 --> 00:46:32,020
Wait, can I get one too?

788
00:46:32,020 --> 00:46:33,020
I'm rubber deer glue.

789
00:46:33,020 --> 00:46:36,780
I need to have a bait for one of these Twitter bots or something.

790
00:46:36,780 --> 00:46:37,780
Yeah, okay, wait.

791
00:46:37,780 --> 00:46:41,380
Somebody make a Twitter bot of all three of us combined.

792
00:46:41,380 --> 00:46:45,220
Here, they'll do this every week or something, ready?

since the last one. That's pretty good. And that's so you can kind of we can have

799
00:47:15,500 --> 00:47:21,180
seven different accounts each day. But I want to do one that's like the bot gets

800
00:47:21,180 --> 00:47:28,620
a post a lot so maybe I'll do like I'll do like like it's been one minute and

801
00:47:28,620 --> 00:47:34,180
they'll just post it every minute right? It's been a second. The thing about that

802
00:47:34,180 --> 00:47:40,380
is you need the video of it so maybe with this episode. Well somebody can make a video.

803
00:47:40,380 --> 00:47:44,700
I'm thinking it's my voice. I'm working in an audio medium. I don't really care if

804
00:47:44,700 --> 00:47:48,060
they know what I look like. I'm picturing like a mouse or something. With the episode we got a mouse.

805
00:47:48,060 --> 00:47:52,380
Like a red ball mouse. Maybe. Yeah one that wears a Paw Patrol helmet. No that's not.

806
00:47:52,380 --> 00:47:55,900
Like a mouse like drinking a cup of coffee that's like bigger than it or something you know.

807
00:47:55,900 --> 00:48:01,500
Um I don't even know. I don't even drink coffee. What about like a mouse trapped in petroleum jelly?

808
00:48:01,500 --> 00:48:06,540
Yeah it could be like a like a beautiful woodland fairy that's one inch tall and it's trapped in a

809
00:48:06,540 --> 00:48:12,420
block of amber and it's like suffocated did you say beautiful I sure did well

810
00:48:12,420 --> 00:48:19,340
garsh the goofy on the kingdom hearts hat is getting no no no no cuz that hat

811
00:48:19,340 --> 00:48:26,060
specifically is from which game is that that is a hearts no but there's a

812
00:48:26,060 --> 00:48:31,700
specific Kingdom Heart point your head down so I can see the full thing let's

813
00:48:31,700 --> 00:48:32,700
Let's analyze this.

814
00:48:32,700 --> 00:48:35,100
Jay Z the Black Album right now.

815
00:48:35,100 --> 00:48:38,480
That is... it's not Birth By Sleep.

816
00:48:38,480 --> 00:48:41,880
It's the one with Tara and Ventus.

817
00:48:41,880 --> 00:48:43,980
So I got you like a...

818
00:48:43,980 --> 00:48:44,980
A deep cut?

819
00:48:44,980 --> 00:48:45,980
Yeah, I think so.

820
00:48:45,980 --> 00:48:47,380
I'm gonna give you a deep cut.

821
00:48:47,380 --> 00:48:50,300
A deep cut Kingdom Hearts hat?

822
00:48:50,300 --> 00:48:51,480
Yeah.

823
00:48:51,480 --> 00:48:53,180
That's the one, it was on PSP.

824
00:48:53,180 --> 00:48:54,180
Whoa.

825
00:48:54,180 --> 00:48:55,740
Oh, wait.

826
00:48:55,740 --> 00:49:00,020
I think it is Birth By Sleep.

827
00:49:00,020 --> 00:49:03,200
- Pat is doing Star Wars with something else right now.

828
00:49:03,200 --> 00:49:04,680
- I know, and it's Kingdom Hearts,

829
00:49:04,680 --> 00:49:05,940
how fucking horrible is that?

830
00:49:05,940 --> 00:49:07,380
- It's really, really bad.

831
00:49:07,380 --> 00:49:10,460
- You know, Caleb, the problem might not be Star Wars.

832
00:49:10,460 --> 00:49:12,100
- Yeah, now that I'm thinking about it,

833
00:49:12,100 --> 00:49:13,780
we might be getting to a deeper issue,

834
00:49:13,780 --> 00:49:17,580
which is Pat sucks.

835
00:49:17,580 --> 00:49:20,540
- No, come on, that's too much.

836
00:49:20,540 --> 00:49:22,340
- Pat, you don't suck, man.

837
00:49:22,340 --> 00:49:23,260
- I don't think he's--

838
00:49:23,260 --> 00:49:25,300
- Yeah, you don't suck, you blow.

839
00:49:25,300 --> 00:49:28,380
- Oh, shit, dude.

840
00:49:28,380 --> 00:49:34,540
I'm learning I'm learning something about the way my brain works yeah maybe there's

841
00:49:34,540 --> 00:49:39,180
a test I will say it's a choice if it's a choice between Kingdom Hearts and Star

842
00:49:39,180 --> 00:49:43,020
Wars I'm sticking with Star Wars we can go back to that one yeah I'm not no I

843
00:49:43,020 --> 00:49:47,380
was just I was just trying to point out that the hat that I got him specifically

844
00:49:47,380 --> 00:49:52,140
is like the like probably the weirdest one I could have got it and here's what

845
00:49:52,140 --> 00:49:56,760
I did stay on the back is so funny yeah saying is pretty it looks like somebody

846
00:49:56,760 --> 00:50:03,480
left M&M's on it. Did you know that it was from GameStop Returns? No. So they just ripped

847
00:50:03,480 --> 00:50:10,000
you off. Cause it says GameStop Returns on the front of the box. They sent you off. It

848
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:16,000
probably has fucking lice dude. Yeah. Absolutely. Thank God. For sure. It's a Kingdom Hearts

849
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:21,560
Birth by Sleep hat of course it has lice. I will say since I got this, I'm not kidding

850
00:50:21,560 --> 00:50:23,560
I think I've had a huge rash on the back of my head.

851
00:50:23,560 --> 00:50:25,560
Are you serious?

852
00:50:25,560 --> 00:50:28,560
Yeah, it might not be visual right now because I just took a shower.

853
00:50:28,560 --> 00:50:30,560
Do you see it?

854
00:50:30,560 --> 00:50:32,560
Oh, I do.

855
00:50:32,560 --> 00:50:34,560
I had like a big red splotch on the back of my head.

856
00:50:34,560 --> 00:50:36,560
Oh my god.

857
00:50:36,560 --> 00:50:38,560
I got Caleb the best gift of all.

858
00:50:38,560 --> 00:50:40,560
New pets.

859
00:50:40,560 --> 00:50:42,560
A new disease.

860
00:50:42,560 --> 00:50:44,560
That's so sweet.

861
00:50:44,560 --> 00:50:46,560
If you let the lice dig in for long enough, it's going to look like hair plugs.

862
00:50:46,560 --> 00:50:48,560
That's a good point.

863
00:50:48,560 --> 00:50:50,560
They're all just sticking their legs out.

864
00:50:50,560 --> 00:50:54,080
yeah i just got so hungry for hair they're gonna be digging into your head

865
00:50:54,080 --> 00:50:57,920
and pulling the hair out making it longer they don't eat hair they eat hair

866
00:50:57,920 --> 00:51:02,640
they don't they eat hair they what else would they eat nothing else is on your

867
00:51:02,640 --> 00:51:08,960
head the bread crumbs on your head and the food bread there sometimes you

868
00:51:08,960 --> 00:51:11,520
leave shit on your head dude you're walking around the village put a

869
00:51:11,520 --> 00:51:16,080
pineapple on your head you put like the crumbs from the pineapple stay in your

870
00:51:16,080 --> 00:51:19,680
head there's a different there's shit left over on your head you know yeah and

871
00:51:19,680 --> 00:51:21,920
and that's what lice like to feed on.

872
00:51:21,920 --> 00:51:26,000
Yeah, lice are trying to, they think hair is just big food.

873
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:30,560
Have you ever had, have you ever had those, one of those bugs that crawls in

874
00:51:30,560 --> 00:51:34,240
your skin that has a very questionable name?

875
00:51:34,240 --> 00:51:37,760
Huh? Oh, oh it starts with a C? Yeah. CH? Yeah.

876
00:51:37,760 --> 00:51:41,200
Oh yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah. Chickers? Yeah. Those are

877
00:51:41,200 --> 00:51:45,040
not fun dude. That's like the worst version of lice. Did you guys ever have a botfly?

878
00:51:45,040 --> 00:51:48,640
Did you guys ever have a botfly or get Ebola? I've had that, yeah.

879
00:51:48,640 --> 00:51:52,080
I've had both of those. Did you guys ever get, did you guys ever...

880
00:51:52,080 --> 00:51:56,640
Were you guys afraid of Ebola in 2014? Oh yeah. No. I knew I was. I knew I was immune.

881
00:51:56,640 --> 00:52:01,120
I saw some picture of some guy like being like like covered in blood and I was like damn that's

882
00:52:01,120 --> 00:52:05,920
what happens when you get Ebola. Yeah the Ebola outbreak. I don't like blood. Yeah. I was afraid

883
00:52:05,920 --> 00:52:11,600
of swine flu but because my mom told me that Obama was using it to start martial law and put

884
00:52:11,600 --> 00:52:17,120
Christians in camps. I was afraid of swine flu because I was like it's zombies. I wasn't afraid.

885
00:52:17,120 --> 00:52:24,960
I didn't take swine flu serious until like two or three years after swine flu was a bad and I learned

886
00:52:24,960 --> 00:52:30,320
that the lead singer of that band broadcast died of swine flu and I was like because I was like oh

887
00:52:30,320 --> 00:52:34,320
swine flu is like all fucking made up I never fucking got it and then I found out somebody

888
00:52:34,320 --> 00:52:39,840
died somebody famous died from it and I was like whoa maybe I should have taken that serious that's

889
00:52:39,840 --> 00:52:43,840
why more famous people they should have let more famous people die of covid could have saved a lot

890
00:52:43,840 --> 00:52:48,040
John Pryan died of COVID I think. See? Don't know who that is. They should have

891
00:52:48,040 --> 00:52:51,940
picked like like injected into Brad Pitt or something. They should have let fucking Tom Hanks die.

892
00:52:51,940 --> 00:52:57,040
Yeah let him fucking rot. Oh dude I guarantee you my grandma would be getting vaccinated right now.

893
00:52:57,040 --> 00:53:03,400
If Tom Hanks did die of COVID we would have like it it would have been there

894
00:53:03,400 --> 00:53:06,840
would be no vaccination. Worldwide there would be no vaccination. 100%

895
00:53:06,840 --> 00:53:12,340
Christians would be in camps if Tom Hanks had died. Yeah. Absolutely bro.

896
00:53:12,340 --> 00:53:18,020
100% no question I mean it's like it would have gone down a very dark path to

897
00:53:18,020 --> 00:53:23,060
bring up Chet but Chet would be like leading a resistance right now yeah yeah

898
00:53:23,060 --> 00:53:27,420
yeah it would be Chet Guevara

899
00:53:27,420 --> 00:53:38,140
all right so now since you said that you do have to make the check of our shirt

900
00:53:38,140 --> 00:53:42,780

sponsoring us for 80 episodes and I've forgotten every single one I think we're

908
00:54:22,820 --> 00:54:26,980
at a point now we come up with so many good shirt ideas for them yeah that's

909
00:54:26,980 --> 00:54:32,260
true you're giving them so much we need to get a cutback dude I mean so many

910
00:54:32,260 --> 00:54:37,700
shirts they can do. We could at most get a promo code. Absolutely for snorting. Okay here I've got

911
00:54:37,700 --> 00:54:43,140
another one for them. We can do a Chet collection okay. Here's one Chet Hanks sitting at a table in

912
00:54:43,140 --> 00:54:50,420
a restaurant hand raised in the air. Chet please. That's right that's pretty fucking good dude. Yeah

913
00:54:50,420 --> 00:54:55,380
and we can do it in like a like a like a comic book printing style where they have the little

914
00:54:55,380 --> 00:55:02,100
color dots you know. That will that'll be really good. Chet yourself before you ret yourself. Okay

915
00:55:02,100 --> 00:55:06,660
yeah we're getting somewhere now that can be a collab shirt Chet Hanks and Rhett and

916
00:55:06,660 --> 00:55:15,540
Link what about Jackie Chet and it's like Chet Hanks and he's dressed up like Jackie

917
00:55:15,540 --> 00:55:22,500
Chan in certain way well that's like like Chet Throatole and he's like a metal band

918
00:55:22,500 --> 00:55:26,980
he's playing a flute yeah he's playing a cool flute and a bad metal band uh-huh

919
00:55:26,980 --> 00:55:33,780
and the song aqualung does okay wait no no I got it okay ready this is a coffee mug

920
00:55:33,780 --> 00:55:40,740
this is marketed to older women okay picture like very like a the type of the

921
00:55:40,740 --> 00:55:44,480
type of picture of Chet's face that you get on like you see you on a somebody's

922
00:55:44,480 --> 00:55:49,140
tattoo when like they're there they get a wife wife dies you know like the black

923
00:55:49,140 --> 00:55:55,140
and white like yeah yeah that yeah and and it says I'm a ched a rose sexual oh

924
00:55:55,140 --> 00:56:00,160
Oh, that's pretty good and also it's like already aged poorly

925
00:56:00,160 --> 00:56:06,380
Yeah, be like a really awesome point. Yeah. I mean, it's just it's a it's the inverse of

926
00:56:06,380 --> 00:56:10,440
Quomo sexual except it's the same and one way at least

927
00:56:10,440 --> 00:56:16,840
Yeah, I mean that is what opposites are. It's the same thing but a little different. Yeah, I guess you're right

928
00:56:16,840 --> 00:56:18,840
Yeah, that is a good point

929
00:56:18,840 --> 00:56:23,680
Opposites it's really intriguing and we could do shoes called Chet knees. Okay?

930
00:56:23,680 --> 00:56:31,720
oh yeah yeah Chetney's then we could do instead of Jordans Chet's mm-hmm oh my

931
00:56:31,720 --> 00:56:37,040
god Chetney's America and then we can shorten that to Ch-America Chetney's

932
00:56:37,040 --> 00:56:43,720
Hank Eric Hank Erica cuz his last name's Hank yeah Chet Hank Aaron Chet Hanks

933
00:56:43,720 --> 00:56:49,560
Aaron and we could I don't know baseball something in there yeah what instead of

934
00:56:49,560 --> 00:56:55,000
the West Bank it's the Chet's Hank okay that might solve quite a few issues in

935
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:58,400
the middle east that would be really good yeah this is gonna become the fucking

936
00:56:58,400 --> 00:57:05,000
the new goddamn carol baskin on the podcast no no we're just my foot down

937
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:09,160
about it yeah not doing it anymore yeah no doma check we're done with it yeah

938
00:57:09,160 --> 00:57:13,840
yeah so what about a shirt so what about a shirt that's like Christmas carol

939
00:57:13,840 --> 00:57:20,840
baskins yeah okay and it's like and it's like you'll you'll scratch your eye out

940
00:57:20,840 --> 00:57:27,840
with that you'll see fuck that movie is not called the Christmas whatever it

941
00:57:27,840 --> 00:57:36,120
doesn't matter the idea will get across yeah that'd be a that'd be a very

942
00:57:36,120 --> 00:57:40,000
different line of okay it's a line of Carol Baskin shirts for different

943
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:44,560
Christmas movies. The line is called Christmas Carol Baskins, but then they just say the

944
00:57:44,560 --> 00:57:47,040
name of the movie so you don't have to worry about doing the puns.

945
00:57:47,040 --> 00:57:52,160
That is good, yeah. So you could have like, what's a Christmas movie?

946
00:57:52,160 --> 00:57:53,160
There aren't any.

947
00:57:53,160 --> 00:57:54,160
I can die hard.

948
00:57:54,160 --> 00:57:57,160
Yeah, you could call it Ty-gar.

949
00:57:57,160 --> 00:57:58,160
Ty-gar.

950
00:57:58,160 --> 00:58:05,680
That might work pretty well. What's another Christmas movie?

951
00:58:05,680 --> 00:58:06,680
